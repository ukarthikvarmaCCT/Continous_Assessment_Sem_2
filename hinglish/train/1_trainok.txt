 Friday's match in Ranchi is very special for Local Boy Dhoni
 naa sirf isliye ki team india siries main 0-1 se peeche he or uski ranking daanv par he balki isliye bhi kyonki homeground par dhoni kaa yah aakhri antarrashtriya match ho saktaa he
 It is being speculated that Dhoni will retire from the shorter format after the T20 World Cup
 world cap tii-20 kaa koi bhi muqabla ranchi main nahin hona he
 In such a situation, he will be on the field as the captain and player for the last time in Ranchi

 Dhoni was part of the team in two matches
 unka sarvshereshth score is maidan par naabad 10 ranon kaa he
 The last time there was a match against Sri Lanka at this ground, in which Dhoni was not part of the team
 is baar bhi srilanka ke khilaaf jeessie antarrashtriya stadium par srilanka ke khilaaf pehla tii-20 match he
 However neither Dhoni nor the State Association has prepared any kind of Farewell
 tippaniyan But Dhoni probably has this last chance, playing a good innings at homeground to help the team win dhoni ne jis tareeke se test se sanyas liya use dekhte hue ye lagata bhi nahin ki wo match se pehle ye baad main is tareeke kii koi baat ya ghoshnaa karenge

 Directors: Subhash Kapoor Artist: Akshay Kumar, Huma Qureshi, Saurabh Shukla and Anu kapoora Jolly came in 2013, which was a surprise hit and has come in a jolly 2017 with lots of preparations
 film hit hone ke saath hi isse ummiden bhi bad jaati hai
 Jolly is the same with LLB-2
 arshad varsi kii jagah akshay kumaar aa gaye hai or bajet bhi bad gaya he
 That is the familiar style of Bollywood
 dekhen 'jolly elelbi2' kii screening par koun-koun pahunchafilm kii kahani akshay kumaar (jolly) kii he
 Who is a mastermind, and wants to do something
 lekin locha vahi he jo pehle jolly ke saath he
 Nothing clicks and he has to do a lot of wrong-doing
 lekin ek din use ek aisa cese miltaa he, jisase uski jindagi hi badal jaati he
 The person who moves forward thinking, the circumstances are different from him
 is tarah ek mastamaula or kuch frod kism ke is vakil ko sanjeeda hona padataa he, or iske saath hi bhartiya nyaaypalika kii hakeekat or pechidagiyaan bhi saamne aati hai
 Director Subhash Kapoor has presented the atmosphere of the court and things related to the Indian judiciary
 subhash ne kahani se lekar diarection tak kai jagah haath aajamaaya he
 In such a situation, the story of the film seems to be a bit stretched at some places, and it seems to be mostly out of court
 film ke vanaliner mjedaar hai
 The problem with making Bollywood sequels is that they work on the fly
 aisa hi kuch jolly ke saath bhi he
 Jolly LLB 2 shooting in Lucknow, Jolly Arshad Warsi, where it was natural and new to the screen, this jolly is not like that
 arshad kii comic timming kamaal kii thi jabaki akshay kai seens main efort karte najar aate hai
 Especially on those occasions where he competes with well-known actors like Anu Kapoor and Saurabh Shukla
 anu or saurabh ne apane kirdaaron ke saath kamaal kiya he
 Huma has nothing to do for Qureshi
 akshay kumaar panch achche maarthe hai or unhone kul milakar hameshaa jaisi hi acting kii he
 Nothing new has been done
 dekhen kaisaa he 'jolly elelbi2' kaa trailrafilm ko lekar acchhee hip he, or gane bhi thik-thaak hai
 Oneliners of the film are good
 film kaa second half khinchaa hua lagata he
 Overall, the film is directed by Akshay Kumar and not Jolly
 bajet lagbhag 80 karod ru
 Is told
 akshay kii pichhali filmein box offis par acchhee kamai kar gai thim
 In such a situation, Jolly is also expected to do well
 lekin yah baat bhi he ki film ke liye box par safar aasaan nahin rahane vaala he
 He is the Only player to get 2 consecutive golden bats at ICC Champions Trophy

 Now imagine if the government itself issued a report that unemployment rate in 2017-18 is 6
 1 ho gai thi jo 45 saal main sabase adhik he to uski naakaamiyon kaa dhol fat jayega
 Such unemployment was there in 1972-73

 8 percent and people were sitting in homes due to lack of work
 centre for monitering indian inconmi (CMIE) ke mahesh vyas to pichley teen saal se berojgaare ke aankade saamne laa rahe hai
 Because of them, when the unemployment figures started being talked about, the government stopped releasing labor reports
 unhone pichley maheene ke prime time main bataaya tha ki berojgaare kii dar nau pratishat se bhi zyaada he jo ki ati he
 You search the news related to employment and employment statistics on the Internet
 aapako pataa chalegaa ki logon main ummid paidaa karte rahane ke liye khabaren paidaa kii jaati rahi hai
 Later, there is no trace of those reports
 jaise farvari 2018 main sarkaar apane mantralayon se kahati he ki apane sector main paidaa hue rojgaar kii suchi banaaen
 Where are those lists after one year
 pichley saal tii si e anant kii adhyakshata main ek nayaa panel bana tha
 He had to tell what to do to collect reliable employment figures
 iske naam pehle jo lebar report jari hoti thi, vah band kar di gai
 July 2018 This panel was supposed to submit its report but asked for a six-month extension
 isiilie behatar aankade kii vyavastha ke naam par unhone puraani report band kar di kyonki uske kaaran sawaal uthne lagate the
 Now when the National Statistical Commission report has come, it is being suppressed
 sochie sarkaar chaahati he ki aap uskaa moolyankan sirf jhooth, dharmik or bhavuk baton par karen
 The government's economic policies have failed, so the stadium is being decorated like the American model to keep the speech attractive
 acchhee liting ke zarie pradhanmantri ko phir se mahaan upadeshak kii tarah pesh kiya ja rahaa he
 He has lost education and employment with his agenda and speeches
 unhen pataa he ki ab kaam karne kaa mauqaa bhi chalaa gaya
 So, he has left the Prime Minister's office in a way
 bharat ke pradhanmantri sau sau reliyaan kar rahaa hai lekin ek main bhi shiksha or rojgaar par baat nahin kar rahe hai
 i have never seen such a young anti-prime minister
 sarkari karche par hone vaali in sau reliyon ke kaaran pradhanmantri bees din ke baraabar kaam nahin karenge
 If divided into twelve hours, it will not work for forty days
 ve din raat camere kii nazar main rahete hai
 Just imagine when they do the work? a whirlwind of religious issues is being created through news channels so that people's questions change
 ve naukari chhod kar sena kii bahaduree or mandir kii baat karne lag jaaen
 Our army has always been brave
 sari duniya loha maanati he
 Why is the Prime Minister doing military service again and again? Does the soldier's child not need education and employment? They know that only religious bigotry can save
 isliye ek taraf ardh kumbh ko kumbh bataakar maahaul banwaaya ja rahaa he to duusari tarah rojgaar ke sawaal gaayab karne ke liye anaap-shanaap mudde paidaa kiye ja rahe hai
 God bless you, the unemployed youth of India! But that too will not do because it is also being used in elections

 # supermachans uttar pradesh ke antim daur ke chunaav main bijepi kii saakh ab purvanchal par tiki he kyonki yahaan kii 89 seat par loksabhaa ke chunaav main bijepi ne bampar jeet hasil kii he
 Therefore, the pressure to preserve it in the assembly elections is also on him
 iske alaava ye 89 seat hi bijepi ke liye upi kii satta kaa rasta bhi saafe karegi
 For this reason, the BJP has thrown its full force
 yahaan tak ki lakhanu kaa warroom bhi ab banaras shift ho gaya he or netaa yahaan deraa daal chuke hai
 The Atal IT cell has been set up in the BJP office in Banaras, which is also the bjp's war room in 15 districts of Purvanchal
 yahaan se fasebuk, watsape, twitor ke jariye bijepi ke paksh main maahaul banane ke saath saath virodhiyon ko bhi jam kar jawaab diya ja rahaa he
 a team of about 17 boys is working here day and night which spreads the speech of the Prime Minister and his top leaders in the entire Purvanchal within minutes
 iti cell ke kapil singh kehete hai ki ham log 15 jile kii siton par booth level par kaam kar rahe hai
 All the speeches of Modi ji are immediately spread on digital media
 purvanchal ko mathne ke liye bijepi ne sirf iti cell hi nahin balki lakhanu ke tarj par ek bada media centre bhi banaaya he
 Where every day, the Union ministers of BJP tell the media about the work done by their ministry before the meeting
 phir apni tufaani sabha main bhi ye janata ko yakeen dilaane kii koshish karte hai ki pradhanmantri narendra modi ne upi or purvanchal ke vikaas ke liye saikadon yojana chalaai he lekin pradesh sarkaar use jameen par utarane nahin detii
 The comments banaras main bijepi kii ye badi kavayad isaliye hai kyonki purvanchal kii bayaar banaras se hi bahati he
 Winning 89 seats in this round can show the way to power for BJP
 isaliye bijepi ke adhyaksh amit shah se lekar sabhi bade netaa or mantri yahaan deraa daale hue hai
 Not only this, Amit Sah can do a big road show on 6 March and Narendra Modi is going to have a big rally on 3 March
 kendriya mantri or bijepi ke bade bade netaa to har roj lagbhag sabhi vidhaan sabha main nukkad sabha ko sambodhit kar rahe hai
 The discussion with this exercise is that apart from Benaras, Modi's rally is also scheduled in the surrounding area, for which he can stay one night in Benaras
 saafe he ki is charan ke chunaav se mili jeet se satta bhale hi lakhanu main milegi lekin uske liye garh banaras bana hua he
 This is the reason that not only BJP but also Akhilesh has eyes on Banaras and Rahul Akhilesh's big roadshow is also set
 banaras ke bijepi ke karyaalay main atal iti cell banaaya gaya he jo purvanchal ke 15 jilon main bijepi kaa war room bhi he
 From here, along with creating atmosphere in favor of BJP through Facebook, whatsapp and Twitter, the opponents are being responded to fiercely
 lagbhag 17 ladakon kii team yahaan din raat kaam kar rahi he jo pradhanmantri or unke bade netaaon ke bhaashan ko minuton main puure purvanchal main failaa detii he
 Kapil Singh of IT cell says that we are working at booth level in 15 district seats
 modi ji ke jo bhi bhaashan aate he unhen foran hi digital media par failaa diya jaataa he
 To churn out Purvanchal, the BJP has built not only an IT cell but also a large media center on the lines of Lucknow
 jahaan har roj bijepi ke kendriya mantri sabha karne se pehle media ke saamne apane apane mantralay ke kiye gaye kaam ko bataate hai
 Then even in their stormy meeting, they try to convince the public that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has run hundreds of schemes for the development of UP and Purvanchal but the state government does not allow him to get on the ground
 tippaniyan These are the major exercises of the BJP in Banaras because the wind of Purvanchal flows from Banaras itself
 is daur kii 89 siton par jeet bijepi ke liye satta kaa rasta dikhaa sakati he
 That is why all the big leaders and ministers from BJP President Amit Shah are camping here
 itnaa hi nahin amit saah 6 march ko ek bada road sho kar sakate hai or 3 march ko narendra modi kii badi raily honi he
 Union ministers and big leaders of BJP are addressing the Nukkad Sabha in almost all the Vidhan Sabha everyday
 is kavayad ke saath charchaa yah bhi he ki banaras ke alaava modi kii raily aasapaas ke ilaake main bhi tay he jiske liye vah banaras main ek raat ruk bhi sakate hai
 It is clear that even though victory from this phase election will bring power to Lucknow, but the stronghold remains for it
 yahi vajah he ki banaras par sirf bijepi hi nahin balki akhilesh kii bhi nigahen hai or rahul akhilesh kaa bada road sho bhi tay he

 unhone pradhanmantri se apil kii he ki maamle kii jaanch puri hone tak gas kii keemten na badhaai jaaen
 Invitation is also a very strange thing, if you get it then going out of your mind becomes compulsion
 
 
 na mili to izzat kaa sawaal ban jaataa he
 
 
 If the occasion is to celebrate the completion of one hundred and fifty years after the birth of the first Prime Minister of the country and today's Prime Minister is not invited, then call it Congress's anger or hand in courtesy
 
 
 vaise, congress kii bhadaas laazmi he
 
 
 Congress has stung the way Modi has redeemed the legacy from Gandhi to Sardar Patel
 
 
 gandhi or patel kii raajnneetik viraasat ko congress ne apni jaagir mana, lekin aaj gandhi jayanti par deshbhar kii gandagi khatm karne kaa mishan ho yaa 31 oktober ko sardaar patel kii jayanti par rashtriya ekta diwas, modi ne in mahaan netaaon ke jariye sarkaar or janata kii saajhedaari kaa ek nayaa panna kholaa he, jisaki chhap lambey samay tak rahegi
 
 
 The Congress feels that Modi is snatching Gandhi and Patel from the Congress
 
 
 nyote par lauten to kya desh kii sabase puraani party pradhanmantri pad kii garima bhul gai he yaa phir modi ko lekar uski chidh or nafrat shishtachar par baari padi he
 
 
 Congress has sent invitations to 52 leaders from 19 countries across the world, from Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee to the Left parties and Lalu Yadav and many other leaders have also been called by Sonia Gandhi
 
 
 ab kya desh kii chhavi ke liye yah acha he ki duniyabar se ahm netaa pahunchen, lekin bharat ke pradhanmantri na hon
 
 
 The Congress says, it has sent an invitation only to those who believe in Nehru's ideology
 
 
 congress ke tark par bahes ho sakati he, lekin kya raajnneetik matbhedon se upar uthakar bada dil dikhaane main congress se chook hui he
 
 
 Modi has been showing respect for the Congress many times, right to the name, in terms of courtesy
 
 
 chunaavon ke baad loksabhaa ke pehle satr main saansadon ke shapathgrahan main pradhanmantri narendra modi or laalkrishna adwani ke baad sonia gandhi kaa shapathgrahan hua
 
 
 On the first day of the 16th Lok Sabha, Modi went to the opposition bench to greet Sonia Gandhi
 
 
 yah sahi he ki chunaav prachaar main 'madam-madam' kahkar modi ne sonia gandhi or rahul gandhi par jamkar tanj kase the, or shaayad uski kadavaahat se ubar paanaa congress ke liye mushkil ho rahaa he
 
 
 On the one hand, Prime Minister Modi is talking about connecting Nehru with the people of the country on his 125th birth anniversary, while the Congress is not showing a narrow mindset by ignoring Modi in Nehru Jayanti
 
 
 nehru kii sava sauveen jayanti ke liye sarkari taiyaariyon par bani cameti main shaamil congress ke sadsy karn singh, gulab nabi aaazaad or mallikarjun khadge modi kii aguwai main is aayojan kii taiyaariyon se pehle khaase santusht bataae gaye the
 
 
 In a conversation with a newspaper, Karan Singh even said that instead of ignoring Modi, Modi has emerged as a leader who wants to take Nehru's message among the people of the country
 
 
 nehru kii 125veen jayanti par congress ke samaaroh main kisi ko bulaanaa, na bulaanaa party kaa adhikaar he, lekin shishtachar or garima ke takaaze par congress ko kya bada dil dikhaanaa chahie tha
 
 
 Even if the Congress had called, Modi would not have come
 
 
 modi 10 din ke videsh daure par hai
 
 
 It could have been something that the matter would have remained and the Congress would have avoided the uncomfortable situation that could have been created by Modi's presence
 
 
 bade netaaon, bade dalon ko bade maukon par badi soch dikhaani chahie

 netaji ke upar shodh kar rahe vidwaanon kaa kahana he ki bose kii maut or usase jude rahasyon ko siyaasi rang diya ja rahaa he
 It is understood that the Mamta government has played the cards of public expressions to some of the files in view of the elections due next year

 In November last year, Pakistan barred Indian diplomats from entering the Nankana Sahib Gurdwara

 akshay tritiya parv ko kai naamon se janaa jaataa he
 It is also called Akhatij and Vaishakh Teej
 is parv ko bharatvarsh ke khaas tyoharon kii shrenee main rakhaa jaataa he
 Bathing, charity, chanting, home, etc
 on this day, whatever is done according to its ability, is received in a renewable form
 akshay tritiya shaadi-byaah ke liye bhi bahut shubh mana jaataa he lekin is baar is tithi par shaadi kaa koi shubh muhoort nahin he
 According to astrologers this is happening after 100 years
 is sthati kii vajah se may or june maheene main shaadi ke dhol nahin bajenge
 What is Akshaya Tritiya? Akshaya Tritiya is the Tritiya Tithi of Shukla Paksha in Vaishakh month
 is din jo bhi shubh kaary kiye jate hai, unka akshay fal miltaa he
 The Satyuga and Treta Yugas have started from this date
 bhagwaan vishnu ne nar-narayan, hriyagreev or parashuram kaa avataran bhi isi tithi ko hua tha
 The idol of Badrinath is installed and worshiped and darshan of Shri Lakshmi Narayan
 prasiddh tirth sthal badrinarayan ke kapaat bhi isi tithi se hi punah khulte hai
 It is considered one of the four most auspicious days of the important Vedic calendar of Akshaya Tritiya
 'akshay' se taatpary he 'jiskaa kabhi kshay na ho' arthath jo kabhi nasht nahin hota
 Akshaya Tritiya (akhatij) is called anant-akshaya-intact fruitful which never decays, it is called Akshaya
 is din ko shaadi ke liye sabase zyada shubh mana jaataa he or hindu dharm main is din sabase zyada shaadiyaan yojit hoti he
 It is said that on this day, there is no need to see a Muhurat for marriage
 100 saal baad ban rahaa he aisa yoga2 may ko padane vaale akshay tritiya ke akshay muhoort vivaah ke do sabase ahm grahon ke ast hone se grahan lagegaa
 According to astrologers, this situation has occurred due to the demise of Dev Guru Jupiter and Venus
 lihaaja yoga is prakaar kaa ban rahaa he ki akshay tritiya ke din shaadi kaa muhoort hi nahin he
 Not getting the wedding auspicious on Akshaya Tritita is being told as the first event of the century
 aisa 100 saal ke baad hua he ki is saal 29 april ko milane walventim vivaah muhoort ke baad vivaad kaa koi bhi muhoort nahin he
 This means that due to the death of Guru and Venus from 30th April, marriage will be interrupted because there is no auspicious lagna for it
 july maheene main lagegaa lagn muhurtashukr kaa tara 30 april se pashchim disha main ast ho rahaa he jo phir july maheene main 6 july ko purv main udai hoga
 Only after this will the marriage sum be formed
 july maheene main 6 se 14 taarikh tak shaadiyon kaa shubh muhoort he
 Harishyani is starting from Ashada Shukla Ekadashi on 15 July
 puranic parampara ke mutabik, is din ke baad dev so jaaenge
 Then Chaturmas will start
 isliye 15 july se 10 november tak phir shaadiyon ke muhoort nahin rahenge
 The Vedas and Puranas describe the virtuous and auspicious results from the holy Kumbh Snan
 shuukravaar se sinhasth kumbh kii shuruyaat ujjain main ho chuki he
 It falls on some special formation of planets

 sadi ke mahanayake amitabh bachchan kii film 'TE3N' relies hone vaali he
 Here are some excerpts from the special conversation with him: Amit ji, Marathi movies are doing amazing at the box office nowadays? marathi sahitya or lekhan pehle se hi bahut majboot rahaa he
 The Marathi translation of the poems of Babuji (late Harivansh Rai Bachchan) took place much earlier
 bahut hi adbhut filmein ban rahi hai or ham inaki saraahna karte hai
 i consider myself lucky to be alive to see such work
 aapane bhi riginal filmon main kaam kiya he?ji, maine apane mek ap artist deepak saavant kii filmon main kaam kiya he
 You also got the offer of 'nat Samrat'? Yes, in the middle Mahesh Manjrekar had offered for Hindi remake of 'nat Samrat' but i will not be able to compete with the way Nana Patekar Sahab has worked in Marathi
 
 bahut hi acha or adbhut kaam kiya he
 i want someone else to work in his Hindi remake
 aapako lagata he ki aajkal ke darshak badal gaye hai?ji main aajkal kii peedi or or unke mata-pita ko is baat kaa bahut bada shrey dena chaahunga ki unki soch kaaphi alag he
 Nowadays the public decides what kind of movies he likes
 nai chunautiyaan kya hai?aajkal tivi or internet bade chalange hai kyonki isamen aisi-aisi chijen dikhaai jane lagi hai jisaki vajah se hamen apane ko or behatar banane kaa chalange mil rahaa he jisase kii janata theatre tak aa sake
 Our competition with foreign films has also increased because those people have also started coming to our courtyard
 aapako lagata he ki hollywood kii filmon kii vajah se hamaare market par bhi asar pad rahaa he?ji, hollywood jahaan bhi gaya he us desh kii sanstha ko ekadam barbaad kar diya he
 Be it the United Kingdom, France or Germany
 ab hollywood kii filmein bharat bhi aa chuki hai
 Now our challenge is to raise our level even higher
 khabaren thi ki 'madhushaala' ko angreji main anuvaadit kiya ja rahaa he?ji, aajkal kii jo peedi he wo kavita paath, samskruti paath yaa sahitya main utani ruchi nahin le rahi he
 Hindi speakers speak Hindi less, English speak more
 isiilie jaya (jaya bachchan) ko laga kii babuji kii kavitaaon kaa angreji anuwaad kiya jaae jisase zyada se zyada log use pard saken
 Although 'madhushala' was written in 1933, but a teacher from 'oxford University' translated it into English in 1940 and named it 'house of Wis'
 wo chhapi or kaaphi prachlit hui
 There is talk of publishing his poem and its translation on Babuji's hundredth anniversary
 aapke gharon ke naam 'jalsa' 'pratiksha' or offis kaa naam 'janak' kaise rakhaa gaya?hamaare babuji kii ek line he ki 'swaagat sabake liye yahaan par, nahin kisi ke liye 'pratiksha', to yahaan se 'pratiksha' naam aayaa
 Earlier, Jalsa was named 'mansa', which was the name of the first woman of our entire generation
 babuji kii aatmakatha main ye naam aapako milegaa
 Many people said that do not name it, then the first marriage of our house i
e
 our daughter was married in the same house, then it was named 'jalsa'
 or peeche kii taraf ek chota sa ghar hamane liya to uskaa naam 'mansa' rakh diya
 At the same time, the office was named 'janak' after Babuji
 janak kaa matlab 'pita' hota he
 How to take Critics? It is very important to have Gritrix because they look at the film from their perspective and after reading their review it shows what was good or what was bad, then the next time we make a film, keep those things in mind
 Let's try
 navazuddin ke saath kaam karnaa kaisaa rahaa?vah bahut hi tallent hai
 Film by film, he has been his talent and beauty
 vaise iske pehle bhi maine navaj ke saath 'shu bit' main kaam kiya tha jo kii durbhagyavash relies nahin ho pai
 He also had amazing talent at that time
 navaj, irfan jaise actors ke saath kaam karte hue bahut kuch seekhney ko miltaa he
 There were reports that you will work in the Hindi remake of the Bengali film 'belleshe'? No, this is just news
 isamen koi sachai nahin, maine film dekhi he or film bahut acchhee he
 Do you like any other compositions other than Babuji? Everyone like Sumitra Nandan Pant, Mahadevi Verma, Jaishankar Prasad, Suryakant Tripathi 'nirala', Maithili Sharan Gupt
 'pink' film kaa kya states he?shooting khatm ho gai he, sitambar main relies hogi
 You never thought of becoming a 'poet'? No, because sometimes my mother used to say 'one Poet in the Family is Enough'
 parivaar main ek hi kavi kaa hona bahut he

 On the other hand, the film's co-producer Anurag Kashyap has requested not to download the film through his post on Facebook

 The need was 10 runs off three balls

 Discord in Uttar Pradesh's largest political Yadav family comes at a time when there are assembly elections
 is parivaar ke ek sadsy ramgopal yadav ko samaajawaadee party se hi nikaal diya gaya he
 After being out of the Samajwadi Party for 6 years, Amar Singh's party had a 'comeback' to the party five months ago, then it was feared that there would be a rift in the Samajwadi clan
 janvari 2010 main ramgopal yadav se vivaad kii vajah se amar singh ko samaajawaadee party se baahar kaa rasta dikhaaya gaya tha
 Ram Gopal Yadav, popularly known as 'professor Sahab' among party workers, has a bitter relationship with Amar Singh and Shivpal Yadav
 lekin amar singh ko 'bahari' bataakar unpar hamalaa bolne kii keemat ramgopal ko chukaani padi he
 Mulayam and Shivpal's cousin Ram Gopal's role in the party was as a 'think tank'
 haal ke dinon main sapa main mache ghamaasan ke dauraan ramgopal har vakt akhilesh ke saath khadey rahe
 On Sunday morning, Ram Gopal wrote a letter to SP workers, telling Akhilesh Yadav the future of Samajwadi Party
 ramgopal ne naam liye bina shivpal ko bhrashtachari or vyabhichaari tak kaha
 Ram Gopal wrote in his letter - 'they have accumulated thousands of crores of rupees
 vyabhichari hai
 Want to defeat Akhilesh
 par jahaan akhilesh, vahaan vijay he
 On the other hand, Shivpal ordered the expulsion of Ram Gopal from the party for 6 years
 is dauraan shivpal ne ramgopal parabijepi ke saath milakar sajeeshkarte hue samaajawaadee party ko kamjor karne or akhilesh yadav kii image kharaab karne kaa aarope lagaaya
 While removing Ram Gopal from the party, Shivpal said that his son-in-law Yadav Singh is trapped in the case
 isliye tikadam kar rahe hai
 They have formed a gang in the party
 shivpal ne ramgopal par party todane kaa aarope lagaate hue kaha ki wo sibiai se darkar bijepi se mil gaye hai
 The member of the Rajya Sabha is being fingered by telling Amar Singh, the source of the discord in the socialist clan aapas kii 'tu-tu', 'main-main' ke is daur main sapa mukhiya mulaayam singh yadav ne bete akhilesh ko bhi jamkar khari-khoti sunai he
 But by removing Ram Gopal from the party, Netaji has given the message that whatever happens, now he is not going to leave Amar Singh's company
 saaf he ki sapa mukhiya amar singh kii keemat par koi samjhauta nahin karne vaale hai or amar singh mulaayam ke dil main bane rahenge
 Despite all the protests within the party, Mulayam sent Amar Singh to the Rajya Sabha
 iske baad amar singh ne mulaayam par dabaav banaakar apni kareebi jayaprada ko film vikaas parishad kaa upaadhyaksh manonith karakar unka ‘punarvaas’ kara bhi liya
 But after this, when he started to interfere in the functioning of the government by making Shivpal a pawn and his dominance in the party, Akhilesh started distanceing from him and after making many decisions he gave a message to Amar Singh that he should not walk Will give is daur main har kadam par ramgopal ne akhilesh kaa saath diya
 Ram Gopal stood as a hurdle in Amar Singh's return to the Samajwadi Party
 yahi nahin, unhone party kii taraf se amar singh ko rajyasabha ke liye ummidavaar banaae jane kaa virodh bhi kiya
 For this, Ram Gopal also met Azam Khan, Amar Singh's arch rival
 lekin unki tamaam koshishen naakaam raheen
 Amar Singh has come into form after being elected as a Rajya Sabha member

 ambedkar ne guuruuvaar ko ek raily main kaha tha, ‘‘hamane apane 40 jawan kho die (pulavama hamale main), lekin phir bhi chup hai
 We have been told not to talk about the Pulwama attack

 He also praised the efforts being made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to strengthen relations with other countries
 milkha singh ne amit shah ko kaha ki vah khelon ko badhaava den or khilaadiyon kii madad karen
 Overall, Amit Shah came to Chandigarh and not only tried to bridge the gap between BJP and Akali Dal leaders, but also enthused the party workers
 varsh 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi or uske sahyogi dal kitna kamaal dikhaa paaenge, philhal bhavishya ke garbh main he
 But the BJP has at least cared for its political allies, even if it is influenced by Rahul Gandhi's formulas in Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh

 After meeting with various social organizations to bring a strict Lokpal Bill in the country, Kejriwal while discussing with the reporters said, “the Lokpal Bill proposed by the Joint Committee is extremely weak, lull and lame and we will not accept the said Bill
 ’unhone kaha, ‘yadi sarkaar majboot or sakht lokapal vidheyak lekar nahin aati he to anna hajaare 16 agast se nai dilli main aamaran anshan par baithenge or yadi sarkaar baba ramdev ke samaan hamaare andolan ko kuchalati he to bhi ham sarkaar kii laathiyaan or goliyaan khaane se nahin darenge
 'kejriwal said that the government can crush the movement by imposing Section 144 in Delhi, but if the people of the country take a week off and raise the national flag in front of their homes and raise slogans, then the government cannot impose prohibitory orders all over the country and' 120 crore Anna cannot arrest Hazare '
 kejariwal ne daawa kiya ki yadi desh main sakht lokapal vidheyak ban jaye to desh ke aadhe se adhik netaa jail main honge
 He said that the people sitting in the government are spreading such misconceptions that if a strict Lokpal Bill is formed then it will become a kind of parallel government, whereas it is not true to say so
 unhone kaha ki unki maang samvidhan ke khilaaf nahin balki uski charadivari ke bheetar hi he
 In response to a question, Kejriwal said that the platform of the agitation in Delhi will not be used for political parties, because the leaders of the political party instead of speaking on the Lokpal Bill start targeting their opposition parties

 But to avoid obesity and to stay healthy, it is very important to have a healthy lifestyle
 khaskar wo kaam jisase hamaare pet or pachan tantra kii sehat sidhe taur par judi he
 Some work should not be done immediately after eating
 isse hamaari shaareerik or maansik sehat prabhavit hoti he
 We are telling you some such things which should not be done immediately after eating
 khaane ke turant baad pani naa pienkhane ke turant baad pani nahin pinaa chahie
 This slows down digestion and causes problems of acidity, bloating in the stomach
 khaane ke turant baad soe nahinkhaane ke turant baad sone se bhi diajeshan dhimaa ho jaataa he or khaanaa pachne main kaaphi vakt lag jaataa he
 Because of this, many people have gas problems in the morning and some people also have constipation
 khaane ke do ghante baad hi soen
 There is also a risk of obesity by sleeping immediately after meals
 chocolate khaanaa to dur dekhne ke liye taras jaaenge log, ye he vajahkhaane ke baad chaay naa pienkhane ke turant baad chaay naa pien
 Because of this, there may be burning, swelling, etc
 in the stomach
 isaki vajah se pet main ulcer bhi ho saktaa he
 Therefore, there should be a gap of at least two hours between tea and food
 fal naa khaaenkhaane ke turant baad fal khaane se pachan kriya kaa talmail bighad jaataa he
 Instead of digesting food, it starts to rot
 isliye khaane ke ek ghante baad hi fal khaaen
 Do not smoke if you smoke, do not immediately after eating
 kyonki khaane ke tarant baad dhumrapaan karne se uskaa asar 10 guna zyada hota he
 This can make you vulnerable to heart and respiratory disease
 sirf sehat hi nahin khubsuurati ke liye bhi phydemand he sarson kaa telnahaana nahin chahiekhana khaane ke turant baad nahaane se bachanaa chahie
 Digestion begins after eating food
 aise main puraa sharir apni urja khaane ko pachaane main laga detii he
 But bathing immediately after eating messes up digestion
 sharir thanda ho jaataa he or pachan kriya ke liye jis urja kii jarurat hoti he vah dobaaraa use sanchit kerani pad jaati he
 Due to this, acidity and swelling in the stomach begin
 khaane ke aadhe ghante baad hi nahaana chahie

 Indian Railways is not just to connect one place to another, but is a powerful tool to speed up India's economy
 aaj kaa bajet railway ke sarvangin vikaas ko lekar ke aayaa he
 Railways can provide employment to the youth, railways may also worry about the environment, railways can also expose the image of India to the world, railways can give a new direction to economic development
 koi aisa pahalu nahin he, jo is baar railway bajet main achoota rahaa ho
 i heartily congratulate the Railway Minister that he has come up with a five-year plan to escape the temptation of the then accolades
 pehali baar railway ne financial disipleen or expendisor main disipleen – isaki baat kahi he
 It is an attempt in that direction - to respect the money of ordinary Indian people, to use it properly
 railway main naukari paane ke liye noujvaan betaab hota he, lekin transperency nahin thi
 Today, the youth should get employment, but the railway minister has taken an important step in that direction to be free from corruption
 rail bajet main sarvaadhik dhyaan yatriyon kii suvidha par diya gaya he, railway kii gati par diya gaya he, technology ke apgredation par diya gaya he, or nai-nai kalpanaaon se bharaa hua sarvasparshi, vikaas ke har pahalu ko chune vaala, aaj railway bajet desh ke saamne aayaa he
 The arrangements made for the safety of women, the helpline, the permanent arrangements that are being developed, and the passengers traveling in the railways get good food, a convenience environment is available
 world class railway stations kaise bane? sirf plateform kyon? upar 20 manjila, 25 manjila stesan kyon na ho? upar har prakaar kii suvidhaayen kyon na hon? railway stations ek aadhunik rail kii pahchaan ban sakate hai

 com / xudayn3n1w— ADG PI - INDIAN ARMY (@adgpi)may 12, 2017 Disregarding the criticisms in the computer data monitoring case, Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has said that 'no general monitoring instructions' have been issued in it and the decision has been taken in national security
 kendriya vidhi mantri ravishankar prasad ne bhi rashtriya suraksha kaa hawala dete hue kaha ki iske liye paryaapt suraksha intjaam bhi kiye gaye hai
 Ten central agencies, including CBI, ED and NIA, have been allowed by the Center to intervene, monitor and crack any information created, transmitted, received or stored in any computer under the Information Technology Act
 congress ke netritv main vipaksh ne is faisle ko asanvaidhanik, aloktantric tathaa mul adhikaron par hamalaa bataate hue kaha ki bhaajapa sarkaar bharat ko 'nigaraanee rajya' main tabdeel karne kii koshish kar rahi he
 Jaitley said in a blog titled 'the Congress Speaks Without Thinking', "A campaign with misinformation has been going on since morning that the government has allowed monitoring of computers and is violating the right to privacy
 unhone kaha ki congress party kii aadat rahi he ki vah kisi mudde par bolti pehle he or samajhati baad main he
 He insisted that no such 'general monitoring order' had been given
 vitt mantri ne kaha ki hastkshep kaa yah aadesh rashtriya suraksha or lokvyavastha ke hit he or yah pehle se hi kanoon main he
 Jaitley said that this order only tells A
 which are the authorized agencies for this and it is only under Section 69 of IT Act
 jetali ne kaha ki yah shakti pehle se thi or iskaa prayog samprag sarkaar ke samay bhi kiya gaya tha
 Then what is the way to find out the terrorist who is using the technology in detail
 varna hoga yah ki aatankwaadi to soochna takanic istemaal kar sakegaa lekin jaanch agesiyaan aisa karne main aksham rahengi
 Law Minister Prasad also called it a step taken in the national interest and said that adequate security has been done for this
 prasad ne vipaksh ke aaropon ko khaarij karte hue kaha ki congress, jisane apatkaal or sensorship lagu kii, unhen loktantr par khatre kii baat nahin kerani chahie
 Prasad said that this process is on an ad hoc basis and the entire process has been completely defined
 unhone kaha, 'bada mudda yah he ki ham kahana chaahate hai ki rashtriya suraksha ke lihaaj se yah jaruri he
 So we did it
 isaki pranali uttardaai, suspasht or paardarshee he
 Agencies have been determined
 pratek maamle main hastkshep, nigaraanee, kuta todane ke kaam ke liye samaksh praadhikaar se anumati leni hogi jo ki grih sachiv honge
 Currently, Section 69 of the IT Act allows for the intervention, monitoring or breaking of any information generated, transmitted, stored in any computer in the national security and public interest

 The Governor of Jharkhand Syed Sibte Razi is in the eyes of the Election Commission these days
 kaaran, adarsh aachaar samhita lagu hone ke baad mahatvapurn faisle lenaa
 But he came on the defensive when the Election Commission said that the executive role of the governor falls under the model code of conduct
 baat is tarah he, 23 march ko rajyapal salaahkaar samiti ne rajya sarkaar ke karmchaariyon ke mahangaai bhatte main 6 fisadi vruddhi kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 The BJP took this issue before the Election Commission
 chunaav ayukta es
 Yi kuraishi jab pichley saptaah ranchi aae to unhone kaha ki rajyapal kii kaaryakari bhoomika adarsh aachaar samhita ke antargat aati he
 Permission should have been taken before increasing the dearness allowance of state government employees
 jharkhand ke mukhya chunaav ayukta debashish gupta ne kaha, ''rajyapal kii salaahkaar samiti ne mahangaai bhatte main vruddhi se pehle kisi prakaar kii koi ijaajat nahin lee thi
 When the Election Commission expressed its displeasure over the issue, the Finance Department stopped the increase in dearness allowance on 29 March
 abhi mahangaai bhatte kaa maamla shant hone hi vaala tha ki rajyapal kii bhoomika ek baar bhi chunaav ayog ke radar main aa gai
 The Governor's Advisory Committee met on 30 March
 is baithak main haivi ejineering corporation (echisi) main jaan foonkane ke liye 91 karod ru
 It was decided to issue a check of Rs
 echisi prabandhan ko yah check mangalvaar ko saunpa gaya
 This is Rs 91 crore
 rajya sarkaar ke echisi ke liye manjuur 250 karod ru
 Were released under the revival package
 bhaajapa ne ek baar phir rajyapal kii salaahkaar samiti ke faisle par aapatti jataai or rajyapal ke khilaaf uchit karrwai kii maang kii he
 The funny thing in this is that this time also the advisory committee did not consider it appropriate to take the permission of the Election Commission
 is bare main jab debashish gupta se poocha gaya to unhone kaha, ''echisi ke punaruddhar package ke liye check jari karne ko lekar kisi ne koi anumati nahin lee
 HEC had sought permission to disburse the amount received under the package from the state government to the retired employees
 ''is mudde par rajya bhawan ke ek adhikari ne kaha, ''rajyapal kii salaahkaar samiti ne echisi ke punaruddhar ke liye 13 farvari ko 250 karod ru
 The package was announced
 yani yah ghoshnaa chunaavon kii taarikh se pakhwada bhar pehle hi kar di gai thi
 The Advisory Committee has released a portion of the same package
 ''haalanki bhaajapa is masale par koi bhi tark sunne ko taiyaar nahin he
 His state unit president Raghubar Das says, "we have written to the Election Commission to take action against the governor
 yah doosraa mauka he jab salaahkaar samiti ne adarsh aachaar samhita kaa ulanghan kiya he
 This package is aimed at benefiting Congress candidate Subodh Kant Sahai from Ranchi
 '' unhone kaha ki rajya main nishpaksh chunaav karaane ke liye rajyapal ko jald se jald hataa dena chahie
 Sahay is the Union Food Processing Minister
 ve apni reliyon main daawa kar rahe hai ki unhone echisi ke logon ke liye punaruddhar package sunishchit karaayaa he or ve biimaar company main jaan foonkane main lage hai
 HEC was a loss making company, but for the last three years it has been continuously going in profit
 congress ke netaa daawa kar rahe hai ki yah centre main unki sarkaar he jisane yah punaruddhar kiya he
 HEC has about 6,000 employees, which can bring a huge change in the prospects of any candidate in an election
 uttar pradesh kii estf ne lakhanu main kai petrol panpon par chaape markar tel kii chori ke gorakhdhandhe ko benakaab hua he
 This action has proved how customers are cheated at petrol pumps
 aapako bataate hai aise tareeke jinase aap is thagi se batch sakate hai
 1-check the pump owners often manipulate the meter beforehand to steal mileage petrol
 jaankaar naresh taneja ke mutabik desh main kai petrol pump ab bhi puraani takanic par chal rahe hai jisamen herapheri karnaa behad aasaan he
 According to the rules, only the oil company mechanic can fix the petrol pouring machine
 lekin petrol panpon ke maalik aksar privet maikenikon kii madad lete hai
 Machine tampering occurs at the same time
 lihaaja aap alag-alag petrol panpon se tel dalawaaen or apni gaadi kii milage lagaataar check karte rahen
 2- Keep an eye on the meter: You must have often seen that at petrol pumps you are offered to polish the car
 yaa phir koi karmchaaree aapkaa dhyaan bantane ke liye poochta ki aap paisa card se chukaayenge yaa cash se
 Even if you miss meditation for a few seconds, you may feel lime
 lihaaja tel petrol bharwate vakt meter par baraabar najar banaae rakhen
 3- Don't forget to reset the meter
 In many petrol pumps, the employees fill the oil for less than your stated amount
 tokane par graahakon se kaha jaataa he ki meter ko jiro par riset kiya ja rahaa he
 But if you are not careful then often this meter is not brought on zero
 isliye ye jaruri he ki aap tel bharwate vakt sunishchit karen ki petrol pump mashin kaa meter jiro par set he
 4- Ensure that there is no remaining petrol in the pipe, you must have seen that at many petrol pumps, the oil filling pipe is kept long
 karmchaaree petrol daalane ke baad auto cat hote hi fouran nojal gaadi se nikaal lete hai
 Because of this, the remaining petrol in the pipe goes into the tank every time
 lihaaja aap is baat par jor den ki auto cat hone ke kuch second baad tak petrol kii nojal aapaki gaadi kii tank main rahe taaki pipe main bachaa petrol bhi usamen aa jaae
 5- Check if there is force in the pipe, while placing oil, put the car slightly away from the machine so that the pipe remains taut and there is no oil left in the force
 6- round figure kii rakam dekar naa bharwaayen telzyaadaatar log 500, 1000 yaa 2000 jaisi rakam adaa karke petrol yaa dijal bharwate hai
 But many petrol pump owners already fix the machine for such a number
 isliye behatar hoga ki aap round figure kii rakam dekar petrol naa bharwaayen
 For example, by filling petrol of Rs 530 or Rs 1575, petrol theft will be difficult and will not cut your pocket
 iske liye jahaan tak mumkin ho card se pement karen
 7 - Is the nozzle button no longer pressed? Ask the petrol pump person to remove the hand from the nozzle after the oil starts coming out
 tel dalavaate vakt nojal kaa batan dabaa rahane se uske nikalne kii speed kam ho jaati he or chori aasaan ho jaati he
 8- Are you filling air instead of oil? Do you often talk of filling petrol in petrol pump round figure after auto cut while filling the tank
 iske liye raji naa hon kyonki auto cat hone ke baad aksar aapaki gaadi kii tank main kam tel jaataa he or kai baar mashin riset nahin hone kii vajah se koi tel hi nahin jaataa yani sirf hawa aapaki gaadi kii tank main jaati he
 9 - Do not forget to lodge a complaint
 If you have any doubt of petrol theft, then do not forget to lodge a written complaint by asking the petrol pump manager for a compact book
 agar aapako complaint book dene main anakani kii jaae to company ke customer care se shikaayat karen
 In this way Topmavatamovie has also been released and people are also liking it
 is film ko rukvane ke liye abhi bhi kai log court kaa rasta akhriyaar kar rahe hai
 a few hours after the release, another petition was filed in the Delhi High Court
 isamen kaha gaya ki film ko sensor board se mili certificate ko hi khaarij kar diya jaae
 This petition was filed by Bhagwan Singh of Chittorgarh, who is also the general secretary of the Johar Samiti Institute
 haalankihaai courtne is maamle main sunwaayee to kii, lekin kaha ki vah kisi tarah kii koi raahat yachikakarta ko nahin de sakate
 The petitioner should go to the Supreme Court for this
 jahaan padmavati ko lekar pehle bhi sunwaayee ho chuki he
 This petition not only sought to revoke the Padmaavat film certificate received from the censor board but also requested section 5-C of the Cinematography Act to be considered a violation of article 14 of the Constitution

 aapako jaanakar hairaani hogi ki vah maidan par nahin, balki khud ko aaraam dekar agle match kii ranneeti bana rahe hai
 In fact, Rohit played an unbeaten innings of 208 runs to give India a 1–1 score in the current series
 hitman kaa ajooba: ek rohit sharma akele 2398 khilaadiyon par hai barisrilanka ke khilaaf siries ke nirnaayak mukaable se pehle hitman rohit ne apni ek tasviir instagram par post kii he
 In which he has written - Good rest = Good preparation (good rest = Good preparation)
 tasviir post karne ke pehle minute main kareeb saadhe teen hajaar phens ne like kiya
 In the absence of Virat, Rohit has captained India in a limited format
 17 disambar ko vishakhapatnam vanade jitkar siries 2-1 se apane naam karne par unki nigahen hai
 Interestingly, Rohit has scored 1286 runs in 1286 balls so far this year
 yani rohit ne apana strike rate- 100 pratishat rakhaa
 This year Rohit has an ODI match in his hands
 jab vah ravivaar ko vishakhapatnam vanade main utrenge, to team india kaa yah is saal aakhri vanade bhi hoga
 Rohit Sharma can surpass Virat Kohli in terms of scoring the most runs this year due to his superb form, but for this he will have to score 175 runs in Visakhapatnam ODI

 71 abhi loksabhaa chunaav ke do charan hone baaki hai
 No one knows what will happen on May 23, but many opposition parties have started juggling to form the government, but they have a fear
 vah yah ki trishanku loksabhaa ke halaat main bijepi agar sabase badi party ke rup main ubhari to kahin raashtrapati use sarkaar banane ke liye na bula len
 This has happened in 1996 when the then President Dr
 Shankar Dayal Sharma called BJP to form the government under the leadership of Atal Bihari Vajpayee
 tab bijepi ko 161 siten hi mili thim
 They could not prove their majority and the government fell in thirteen days
 lekin vipakshi partiyon ko lagata he ki aisa is baar hua to halaat badal sakate hai, kyonki bijepi choti partiyon main tod-phod kar sakati he or unhen apane saath milakar bahumat juta sakati he
 That is why 21 opposition parties will seek an appointment with the President after the voting ends on May 19
 ve kahengi ki trishanku loksabhaa hone par sabase badi party ko sarkaar banane ke liye na bulaayaa jaae
 These 21 parties can give a joint letter to the President before the results are out
 kaha ja saktaa he ki sarkaar banane ke liye unhen bulaayaa jaae
 What does this unexpected and unprecedented move mean? What does the constitution say about this? There are two models right now
 ek shankar dayaal sharma kaa, jisamen sabase badi party ko sarkaar banane ke liye bulaayaa gaya
 The second is that of KR Narayanan
 ise 1998 or 99 ke chunaav nateezon ke baad lagu kiya
 Atal Bihari Vajpayee was then called to form the government only when he handed over letters of support to 272 mps
 haalanki sabase badi party ko sarkaar banane ke liye bulaanaa koi niyam yaa parampara nahin he
 It first started in 1989 in true sense
 tab trishanku loksabhaa bani or isamen 194 siton ke saath congress sabase badi party bani
 The then President R
 Venkataraman invited Rajiv Gandhi to form the government
 lekin unhone sarkaar banane se manaa kar diya
 After this, the alliance was given a chance after the election led by VP Singh
 isliye ab sawaal sabase badi party kaa nahin, balki sabase bade gathbandhan kaa bhi he
 If Narayanan's model is implemented, then even the largest coalition can be asked to give letters of 272 mps
 gathbandhan bhi do tarah ke hai
 Pre-election and post-election alliance
 kise mauka milanaa chahie? aise kai sawaal he
 The opposition is already trying to prevent the largest party or the largest pre-poll coalition from being invited, as it believes that the BJP may emerge as the largest party and the NDA the largest coalition, but remain away from the majority
 is
 haalanki nattejey aane se pehle hi is tarah kii kavayad kaa kya matlab he? par yaad dilaa duun ki 2009 main congress ne hi isaki shuruyaat kii thi
 Even before the results came out, Congress General Secretary Digvijay Singh had said that President Pratibha Patil should not call the largest party to form the government
 to is baar ramnath kovind kya karenge? kya sabase badi party yaa gathbandhan ko sarkaar banane ke liye bulaanaa chahie? yaa phir un dalon ko jinke paas 272 kaa aankada ho? samvidhan main aise halaat ko lekar kuch nahin kaha gaya he
 Article 75 (1) only states that the President will appoint the Prime Minister, but what is the condition or scope for that, it is left to the discretion of the President
 vaise rajya vidhansabhaon main trishanku nattejey aane ke kai vaakye hai
 In such a situation, the role of the governor becomes very important
 aisa kai baar hua jab rajyon main sabase bade dal ko sarkaar banane kaa mauka nahin diya gaya, balki rajyapal ne yah dekha kii sthai sarkaar koun de saktaa he yaa phir kis chunaav purv athwa chunaav baad ke gathbandhan ke paas bahumat kaa aankada he
 In 2005, BJP won 30 seats in the 81 seats of Jharkhand, but the 17-seat JMM was invited to form the government as it was supported by other parties and it crossed the majority mark
 2002 main jammu kashmir main neshnal conference 28 siten jeet kar sabase badi party bani, lekin 15 siton vaali pidipi or 21 siton vaali congress ke gathbandhan ko sarkaar banane kaa mauka mila
 In 2013, BJP became the largest party in Delhi by winning 31 seats, but the Aam Aadmi Party with 28 seats got the chance to form the government after the support of Congress
 1999 main maharashtra main congress ko 75 siten or uske khilaaf ladi ensipi ko 58 siten milin, lekin 125 siton vaale bijepi-shivasena gathbandhan ke bajaae chunaav baad bane congress-ensipi gathbandhan ko mauka mila
 However, it is important to keep in mind that in the Westminster system of democracy that we have followed, the purpose of elections is not to elect mps or mlas, but to choose the government
 aise main samvidhan ke rakshak ke taur par raashtrapati ko yah bhi dekhnaa hota he ki sarkaar koun bana saktaa he
 To further liberalize foreign investment, the government is considering raising the limit of FDI in private banks to 100 percent, which is currently 74 percent

 At present 74 per cent is allowed in private sector banking, out of which 49 per cent is allowed through natural route and beyond this through Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB)

 The RBI recently allowed 11 units to set up payment banks and 10 to set up small finance banks
 haal hi main sarkaar ne mishrit puunji kii avdhaaran pesh kii he
 But given the sensitivity of the sector, the government has said that foreign institutional investors cannot cross the limit of capital fixed for portfolio investment in private sector banks
 nijee kshetra ke echdiefasi bank ko videshi nivesh kii seemaa badhaakar 74 pratishat karne ke liye sarkaar kii manjuuri mil gai he

 rashtriya rajdhani dilli main shanivaar ko vaayu gunvattta bahut kharaab rahi
 However, due to the smoke of firecrackers on Diwali and stubble burning in neighboring states, it (air quality) is expected to become 'severe'
 vaayu gunvattta anumaan evam anusandhan seva-safar ke anusaar rashtriya rajdhani kii sampurna vaayu gunvattta ravivaar raat ko kuch samay ke liye ‘gambhir' ho jane kii ashanka he, lekin yah pichley saal jitani buree nahin hogi
 Let me tell you, the air quality index (AQI) was 642 on November 8, the next day of Diwali in the city, which was recorded in the category of very severe emergency
