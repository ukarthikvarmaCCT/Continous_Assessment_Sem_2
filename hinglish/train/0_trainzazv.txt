 maine dekha good evening sunke babuji halkaa sa chaunke phir turant hi unke chahare par halki smit ai jisamen behad laad tha
 i understand that they have been impressed
 main jo maa se lipta hi rahata tha, maa ke kareeb nahin ja rahaa tha taaki unhen pataa chale kii main independent ho gaya hum
 The mother touched me with her affectionate smile, i wanted to cling to my mother, but smiled standing on the spot and gave her proof of my self-reliance
 maa ne babuji ko dekha or muskura deen, main samaj gaya ki ve prabhavit ho gai hai
 Mother, Babuji, Bhaiji and the three of us sat talking in one corner of the hall
 hamase puure hafte kaa vivaran maanga gaya, or 6
 Around 30 o'clock Babuji told us to pack your things, you guys have to go back to Gadarwara, where you will study further
 hamane achakachaa ke maa kii taraf dekha
 The mother appeared in support of Babuji
 hamaare ghar main prashn poochne kii aazaadee thi ghar ke niyam ke mutabik chhoton ko pehle apni baat rakhane kaa adhikaar tha, so niyamanusaar pehla sawaal maine daaga or babuji se gadervaara waapas le jane kaa kaaran poocha? unhone kaha ranaji main tumhen maatr acha vidhyaarthee nahin ek acha vyakti bananaa chahta hum
 You were sent here to learn new, not forget old
 koi nayaa yadi puraane ko bhula de to us nae kii shubhta andeh ke daayre main aa jaati he
 Every little person in our house, his elder, familiar, unfamiliar who comes in contact with him, invites his respect by touching his feet
 lekin dekha ki is nae vaataavaran ne maatr saat dinon main hi mere bacchon ko parichit chodo apane mata-pita se hi charan sparsh kii jagah Good evening kahana sikhaa diya
 i do not say that there is no respect in this greeting, but there is respect in touching the feet, i can say it with confidence
 vidya vyakti ko samvedansheel banane ke liye hoti he samvedanheen banane ke liye nahin hoti
 i saw that you wanted to cling to your mother, but you stood far away, Vidya gives the skill to go to the person standing far away and not to work away from herself
 aaj mujhe vidhyalay or skool kaa antar samaj aayaa, vyakti ko jo shiksha de vah vidhyalay, jo use sirf sakshar banaae vah skool, main nahin chahta ki mere bachche sirf sakshar hoke digriyon ke boj se dab jaaen
 i want to educate my children and understand the pain and lighten their burden
 maine tumhen angreji bhashaa seekhney ke liye bheja tha athmiya bhav bhuulane ke liye nahin
 Better to be illiterate than to be insensitive literate
 isliye bistar bandho or ghar chalo
 All three of us fell immediately at the feet of maa-babuji
 unhone hamen uthaakar gale se laga liya
 
 va shubhashirwad diya ki kisi or ke jaise nahin swayan ke jaise bano
 
 
 The comments poojya babuji jab bhi kabhi thaktaa hum yaa haar kii kagaar par khadaa hota hum to aapkaa yah aashirwad "kisi or ke jaise nahin swayan ke jaise bano" sanjivani ban nav urja kaa sanchaar kar hriday ko utsaah ullas se bhar detaa he

 fasebuk par ashutosh rana kii post jo ki unhone apane divangat pita ke janmdiwas par share kii, yahaan prakashit kii ja rahi he
 It was in the seventies when on the advice of our eldest father Madan Mohan, who was doing his msc from Robertson College Jabalpur, we picked up three brothers from the town school of Gadarwara for better education and enrolled in Christ Church School in Jabalpur city Got it done
 madhya pradesh ke mahakaushal anchal main christ carch skool us samay angreji madhyam ke vidyalayon main apane sheersh par tha
 Pujya Babuji and mother went back to the three of us brothers (nandkumar, Jayant, and i Ashutosh) after getting admission in Christchurch, leaving us in the hostel and promising to meet again next Sunday
 mujhe nahin pataa tha ki jo itvaar aane vaala he vah mere jivan main sadaa ke liye chinhit hone vaala he
 Sunday means a holiday, but that Sunday in the seventies became a "chhoti", not a holiday of my life
 itvaar kii subah se hi main aahlaadit tha, ye mere jivan ke pehle saat din the jab main bina maa babuji ke apane ghar se baahar rahaa tha
 The mind was filled with mixed emotions, the feeling of impressing the mother, Babuji in any corner of the heart was strengthening, this was the day when i understood the difference between love and influence
 bachche apane mata-pita se sirf prem hi paanaa nahin chaahate, ve unhen prabhavit bhi karnaa chaahate hai
 3 in the afternoon
 30 baje ham hostel ke visiting room main aa gaye
 Green blazer, white pants, white shirt, green and white striped tie and Bata's Black Naughty Boy Shoes, this was our school uniform
 hamane visiting room kii khidki se skool ke campus main main get se hamaari miletry green color kii open ford jeep ko andar aate hue dekha, jise mere bade bhai mohan, jinhen puraa ghar bhayeeji kahata tha drive kar rahe the,or maa babuji baithe hue the
 i was very excited that i had full faith in myself that i will impress them both today
 maine pushti karne ke liye jayant bhaiya, jo mujhase chah varsh bade hai, se poocha - main kaisaa lag rahaa hum? ve mujhase ashart prem karte the, mujhe lekar protective bhi the, bole - shandaar lag rahe ho
 Nand Bhaiya approved his words and further boosted my spirits
 jeep rukii
 
 ulate palle kii golden orange sari main maa or jhakk safed dhoti-kurta gandhi topi or kaali jawahar bandi main babuji usase utre
 We could not run and meet him
 yah skool ke niyamon ke khilaaf tha, so meeting haul main jaise sainik vishram kii mudra main alert khadaa rahata he, ek line main teenon bhai khadey maa-babuji ke paas pahunchane kaa intjaar karne lage
 As they came closer, the three of us brothers stood together in their voices in good voice
 Good evening Babuji
 said
 maine dekha good evening sunke babuji halkaa sa chaunke phir turant hi unke chahare par halki smit ai jisamen behad laad tha

 hamane achakachaa ke maa kii taraf dekha

 baat sattar ke dashak kii he jab hamaare poojya pitaaji ne hamaare bade bhai madanamohan jo rabertson college jabalpur se emessi kar rahe the, kii salaah par ham teen bhaaiyon ko behatar shiksha ke liye gadervaara ke kasbaai vidhyalay se uthaakar jabalpur shahar ke christ carch skool main daakhila kara diya
 Christ Church School in Mahakaushal zone of Madhya Pradesh was at the top among English medium schools at that time
 poojya babuji va maa ham teenon bhaaiyon ( nandkumar, jayant, va main ashutosh ) kaa christchurch main daakhila kara hamen hostel main chhodke agle ravivaar ko punah milane kaa aashwaasan deke waapas chale gaye
 i did not know that the sun is going to be marked in my life forever
 itvaar kaa matlab chuttee hota he lekin sattar ke dashak kaa vah itvaar mere jivan kii chuttee nahin "ghutti" ban gaya
 i was delighted since Sunday morning, these were the first seven days of my life when i stayed out of my house without mother Babuji
 man mishrit bhaavon se bharaa hua tha, hriday ke kisi kone main maa, babuji ko impress karne kaa bhav balwati ho rahaa tha, yahi vah din tha jab mujhe prem or prabhaav ke bich kaa antar samaj aayaa
 Children not only want to get love from their parents, they also want to impress them
 dopaher 3
 At 30 we arrived in the visiting room of the hostel
 green blager, white pant, white shart, green and white strib vaali taai or bata ke blike noti boy shoes, yah hamaari skool uniform thi
 We saw our military green color open Ford Jeep coming in from the main gate in the school campus through the visiting room window, which my elder brother Mohan, who was called the whole house brother, was driving, and mother Babuji was sitting
 
 main behad utsahit tha mujhe apane par purna vishwaas tha ki aaj in donon ko impress kar hi luungaa
 i asked Jayant Bhaiya, who is six years older than me, to confirm - how am i feeling? He used to love me unconditionally, was protective about me, said - You look fantastic
 nand bhaiya ne unki baat kaa anumodan kar mere hausale ko or badha diya
 The jeep stopped
 
 The mother in a reverse orange golden orange sari and Babuji descended from her in a white dhoti-kurta Gandhi cap and black Jawahar bundi
 ham daudkar unase nahin mil sakate the
 This was against the school rules, so in the meeting hall as the soldier stands alert in the posture of relaxation, the three brothers standing in a line waiting to reach the mother-babuji
 jaise hi ve kareeb aae, ham teenon bhaaiyon ne sammilit swar main apni jagah par khadey-khadey Good evening Mummy
 Good evening Babuji
 kaha
 i saw good evening listening to Babuji a little bit surprised, then immediately there was a slight smile on his face, which was very dear
 main samaj gaya ki ve prabhavit ho chuke hai
 i used to stick with my mother, i was not getting close to my mother so that she would know that i have become independent
 maa ne apni snehasikt muskaan se mujhe chuaa, main maa se lipatana chahta tha kintu jagah par khadey-khadey muskuraakar apane aatmanirbhar hone kaa unhen saboot diya
 Mother looked at Babuji and smiled, i understand that she was impressed
 maa, babuji, bhayeeji or ham teenon bhai haul ke ek kone main baith baaten karne lage
 We were asked for a full week's details, and 6
 30 baje ke lagbhag babuji ne hamase kaha ki apana saamaan pack karo, tum logon ko gadervaara waapas chalanaa he, vahiin aage kii padhai hogi
 We looked at Achachacha's mother
 maa babuji ke samarthan main dikhaai deen
 We had the freedom to ask questions in our house, according to the rule of the house, the little ones had the right to speak first, so according to the rules, the first question i asked was the reason for taking back Babuji to Gadarwara? He said, Ranaji, i want to make you a good person, not just a good student
 tum logon ko yahaan nayaa seekhney bheja tha, purana bhuulane nahin
 If a new one forgets the old one, then the auspiciousness of that new one comes under doubt
 hamaare ghar main har chota apane se bade parijan, parichit,aparichit jo bhi uske sampark main aata he, uske charan sparsh kar apana sammaan nivedit karata he
 But saw that this new environment, in just seven days, left my children familiar and taught my parents to say good evening instead of touch the stage
 main nahin kahata ki is abhivadan main sammaan nahin he, kintu charan sparsh karne main sammaan hota he, yah main vishwaas se kah saktaa hum
 Knowledge is not meant to make a person sensitive, but is not meant to make one sensitive
 maine dekha tum apni maa se lipatana chaahate the lekin tum dur hi khadey rahe, vidya dur khadey vyakti ke paas jane kaa hunar detii he na ki apane se jude hue se dur karne kaa kaam karti he
 Today i understood the difference between school and school, the school that gives education to a person, the school that only makes him literate, i do not want my children to be literate and be burdened with degrees
 main apane bacchon ko shikshit kar dard ko samajhane uske boj ko halkaa karne kaa maharath dena chahta hum
 i sent you to learn the English language, not to forget the intimate feeling
 samvedanheen sakshar hone se kahin acha samvedansheel nirakshar hona he
 So tie the bed and go home
 ham teenon bhai turant maa-babuji ke charnon main gir gaye
 They picked us up and hugged us
 
 And thank you for being like yourself, not like anyone else
 
 
 tippaniyan Whenever Pujya Babuji is tired or standing on the verge of defeat, this blessing of yours "be like no one else but yourself" Be a lifelike person, by communicating new energy and fills the heart with enthusiasm
 aapako shat shat pranaam

 Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah has said that he is neither in the race to become prime minister nor does he dream of a big chair
 modi or rahul gandhi kaa naam liye bina umr ne kaha ki jo log iskaa khwab dekhakar baithe hai , bas vah hi is daud main bane rahe

 Umar Abdullah questioned this and asked why Arun Jaitley did not go to Muzaffarnagar

 Omar said that he has witnessed the Amarnath movement of 2008 and the violence in Kashmir valley in 2010

 In this, Venugopal admitted that the documents were not stolen, but were leaked

 Because on the basis of these documents, some newspapers and news agencies ran the news

 The court again questioned that since then a month's time has passed

 This is completely wrong
 yah bayaan ki filein chori ho gai hai, puri tarah se galat he
 'the documents leaked from the negligence of the officials
 In two days after this, the Attorney General reversed his statement and said that all the original documents of the process related to the Rafale deal are present in the file, but the way they were shown and made public in the media, Looking at it, it is clear that the original documents have been copied or photographed
 adhikariyon kii laaparvaahee se rafel deal kii filon ke ahm dastavej li hue hai

 ramkaal ke is hanuman mandir ke nirmaan ke koi spasht sakshya to nahin milte hai lekin kehete hai ki ayodhya na jane kitni baar basii or ujadi, lekin phir bhi ek sthaan jo hameshaa apane mul rup main rahaa wo hanuman tila he jo aaj hanuman gadhi ke naam se prasiddh he
 Devotees have to cross 76 steps to reach this mound
 iske baad pavanputra hanuman kii 6 inch kii pratimaa ke darshan hote hai jo hameshaa phool-maalaon se sushobhit rahati he
 Full of the glory of Anjaniputra, the square of Hanuman Chalisa is adorned on the walls of the temple along with the heart
 kehete hai hanuman ji ke is divya sthaan kaa mahatv kisi dharm vishesh main bandhakar nahin rahaa, balki jis kisi ne bhi yahaan jo bhi muraad maangi hanuman lalaa ne use vahi diya
 Only then, on the protection of the life of his only son, Nawab Mansoor Ali of Awadh renovated this temple
 kehete hai ek baar nawaba kaa putr bahut biimaar pad gaya
 Seeing no chance of the son's life being saved, the Nawab bowed at the feet of Bajrangbali
 sankatmochan ne nawab ke putr ke praanon ko waapas lautaa diya, jiske baad nawab ne na keval hanuman gadhi mandir kaa jirnonddhaar karaayaa balki tanmrapatr par likhakar ye ghoshnaa kii ki kabhi bhi is mandir par kisi raja yaa shaasha kaa koi adhikaar nahin rahegaa or na hi yahaan ke chadhaave se koi kar vasuul kiya jayega
 After Sri Lanka's victory, Lord Sri Rama gave place to Lord Hanuman to stay in Ayodhya, which is today called Hanuman Garhi and Hanuman Garhi was also called the security fortress of Ayodhya
 jahaan aaj bhi choti deepawali ke din aadhi raat ko sankatmochan kaa janm diwas manaaya jaataa he
 It is a matter of good fortune for every devotee to witness the birthday of Pawanaputra
 rang birgi jhaalaron or jhilmil karte deepon ke bich raat baarah baje shankhanaad hota he or puraa aasmaan roshni se jagamag ho uthta he
 Devotees want to absorb the joy and joy in themselves by losing the senses
 mana jaataa he ki sankatmochak hanuman ji kaa janm roshni ke is parv kii aadhi raat ko hua tha or isiilie har saal deepawali par desh ke kone-kone se bhakt ayodhya pahunchate hai
 The marks brought as a symbol of victory from Lanka were also kept in the same citadel, which are taken out on special occasions even today and they are worshiped at different places
 holi se thik pehle rang bhari ekadshi un khaas dinon main se ek he jab ye nishaan baahar nikaale jate hai or bhakt unki aradhana kar khushiyaan manaate hai
 This is where Holi begins across the country with the Holi of the sage saints
 yahaan par hanuman lalaa kii aradhana or darshan kaa vishesh samay nishchit he
 It is said that worshiping Pawanaputra in special Muhurta fulfills every wish of the devotees
 hanuman ji ke pratap se apane ko abhibhoot karne ke liye duniya bhar se aane vaale bhakton kaa yahaan tantaa laga rahata he or sachche man main hanuman lalaa ke is darbar main sir jhukaa bhar dene se pavanputra apane bhakton ke samast kashton kaa nidaan kar dete hai

 Baghdadi, the leader of the world's most dreaded terrorist organization, has been reported several times weak
 lekin is baar vaaki uski haalat kharaab he
 Not only are its terrorist destinations being destroyed in every four countries, but its earnings from crude oil and recovery have come down drastically
 in sabase bagdadi baahar nikal paata ki gathbandhan sena ne chaaron taraf se hamalaa bol uski qamar tod di he
 By his terror, which used to make the world cry till yesterday
 jo bina baat hi begunaahon ke sir kaat liya karte the
 Those who used to throw people without any crime
 jo insaanon ko jinda jala diya karte the
 Who used to kill people by drowning while living
 aatank ke us sabase bade saudagar bagdadi or uske aatankiyon ke bure din unki gardan par chadh baithe hai
 The biggest attack in Mosul is evidence of this
 in chaar baton se daraa hua he bagdadi1- abaki baar bachanaa mumkin nahin:pichley dedh saal se bagdadi bhaaga-bhaaga phir rahaa he
 This was the situation when his terrorists spoke

 But now its terror is clouded to the extent of being killed in the capital
 usko ehsaas ho rahaa hoga ki uske liye khud ko bachaana ab aasaan nahin
 His empire of terror has shrunk in Iraq itself
 2- haath se nikal gayi kai ilaake:mosul main ghusane se pehle iraqi sena ne ramaadi, tirakit or fajullah jaise shaharon main aies kaa safaya kar diya
 Baghdadi terrorists are counting the last clocks in cities like Qarakosh, Hamam Al Alil, Khajer, Kuwair and Tal Afar
 17 oktober ko pehle hi din sena ne mosul ke paas 200 kilometre kaa aria mukt kara liya
 After this, 100 terrorists were killed in Bertella within four days
 3- tel kuon or ugaahi kii kamai 30 fisadi giri:darasal bagdadi ne khadi deshon kii araajaktaa kaa laabh uthaate hue tel kuon par apana kabja kar liya tha
 But now the condition has become so bad that he is not able to pay his terrorists even salary
 isse aatanki to bhaag hi rahe the
 The Iraqi army's attack on it grew so fast that Baghdadi terrorists even started fleeing in the burqa
 ye duusari baat he ki unhen kamyaabi nahin mili
 4- Who will become the caliph of his terror: Baghdadi also knows that the terror of ISIS will be killed as soon as it comes to life
 khud ko islamic state kaa khalipha banane kaa sapana dekhne vaala bagdadi ye bhi nahin soch paa rahaa ki uske baad aatank kaa khalipha koun banegaa
 Experts believe that even if someone becomes a caliph, he cannot save IS from ruin

 25 years later, there has been a strong return to righteousness on TV
 tiarapy ke khel main mahadev or bajrang bali se lekar ganesh or bhagwaan buddha tak sab do-do haath kar rahe hai
 The new "dharmayuga" on television can be traced to December 2011, when Devon of Devs on Life OK channel
 
 
 mahadev air hua
 At that time too many religious shows were going on, but Lord Shiva did the work of connecting the audience
 technology or majboot dhang se kahani kehane kii style kaam kar gai or tiarapy kii daud main is serial ne saas-bahu ke naatakon ke varchasv ko todgaye kii koshish kii he

 ’’ mahadev ko mili safalataa kii vajah se hi life oke ab katha mahadev putr bal ganesh kii lekar aayaa he

 When we tell old stories in a new way, then it has an impact on the audience, the same is the case with some religious serials
 ’’tivi par dharm kaa dhamaungar industry ke sutron par yakeen karen to dharmik serials dekhne vaale darshakon kii sankhya main lagaataar ijapha ho rahaa he

 isamen saanskrithik asmita kaa sawaal bhi he
 "that is why the Mahabharata is returning with tremendous threat
" bada bajet or bhavyata is sho kii euaspy he
 Many famous television faces are captivating the audience with their style in this epic
 mahabharat ke produsar siddharth kumaar tiwari bataate hai, ‘‘aaj ke daur main aisa kalakaar dhundia bahut mushkil kaam tha jinka diction sahi ho
 Do you know Hindi well? iske liye hamane kalakaaron ke diction par kaam kiya
 It has taken a year and a half to accomplish all this
 ’’ kahani ko vartmaan se jodgaye kii bhi chunauti thi
 Zee TV has made similar efforts with Buddha

 For this, five acres of plush sets have been installed in Film City

 But it was transformed into a TV serial

 Glamor and Styling is Awesome This serial incorporates the color of religiosity but it is also to be noted that glamor is not ignored in them
 mahadev kii styling kar chukin, mahabharat or buddha kii dress diziner nidhi yasha kahati hai, ‘‘hamen serial ke sabhi kairactors kii dresses par khaas dhyaan dena padataa he
 Take Draupadi of Mahabharata only
 ve agni se paidaa hui thim, saawali thim or kaaphi strang kairactor thim
 While styling took care of these things
 unke liye maine laal rang par jor rakhaa he
 Have avoided heavy jewelry so that the character can emerge
 ’’buddha kii baat karen to isamen bhi is baat kii jhalak bakhubi mil jaati he
 The cast of the characters are sourced from Jodhpur and Jaipur, while the jewelry made in Patna embodies the lavish lifestyle of the Kapilvastu royal family
 nidhi kahati hai, ‘‘satyavati, amba or draupadi jaise firebrands kairactors ke liye hamen unke tewaron ke hisaab se hi dress taiyaar kerani thi, isi tarah kunti kaaphi saumy hai, to unke maamle main color or essessories vaise hi hai
 The importance of glamor can be understood from the fact that Mahadev's sati made a lot of headlines
 in serial ke darshakon main auraton kii badi sankhya he, jis vajah se nirmaataaon kaa styling par khaas jor rahata he
 Nidhi took four years to perfect the costume, jewelry and styling of the Mahabharata, and claims to have read 450 books to understand the characters
 star plus ke senior vaais president (marketing or programing stritegi) nikhil madhok kehete hai, ‘‘ham chaahate the ki mahabharat or iske kirdaaron ko yuvaaon ke saamne pesh kiya jaae
 We have produced shows on a large scale with heavy investment and production value
 ye mahabharat ke mahaan kirdaar hai jinaki kahani se hamaare darshak khud ko conect kar sakenge or ise ek ahm sho main tabdeel karenge
 Mahadev has been coloring for nearly two years on the life OK of religion to politics
 isane mahadev kaa kirdaar nibhaa rahe kalakaar mohit raina kaa to jivan hi badalakar rakh diya he
 He says, "my neighbors and society people ask my mother to have darshan of God

 1980 ke dashak main jab ramayana aayaa tha to log us samay juute-chappal utarkar serial dekhte the yaa phir tivi ke aage maala lekar baith jate the
 These days Mohit Raina is also surrounded by some similar circumstances

 jis samay ram mandir mudda bhartiya raajnneeti main haaavee tha, us dauraan in serials kaa kuch zyada hi bolbalaa dekhne ko mila tha
 During that time, many politicians were concerned about the rise of communalism and the transmission of religious cereals
 haal main centre sarkaar ne 12 rajyon main sampradayik dangon kii sambhaavna jataai he or desh main phir se kai mudde garma rahe hai, aise main dharmik serials kii baadh kai andeh paidaa karti he
 When asked about this, Vivek Kumar, a professor of sociology at Jawaharlal Nehru University, who taught at Columbia University in the United States, says, "for some time, issues related to religion have come to dominate, so the market is trying to cash in on them
 bazaar bhartiya samaaj ko dharm se jodakar dekhtaa he
 The arrival of serials is not sponsored, but the public sentiments are always discounted
 ’’janata conectionaise bhi log hai, jo in serials ko andhvishwaas ko badhaava dene se jodakar dekhte hai
 They feel that such serials serve to create superstitious superstitions among people
 is bare main professor vivek kumaar kehete hai, ‘‘samvidhan kii dhara-51 ke tahat nagarikon ke kartavya bataae gaye hai, jisamen taarkikta kaa prachaar karne kii baat kahi gai he
 But to serve righteousness beyond logic is thus a violation
 beshak hamen dharm ke paalan kii manjuuri he
 But the game of modernism and traditionalism is becoming deadly
 ’’ dharm ko vyaktigat mana gaya he, aise main vishleshak ise saarvajanik banane ko sahi nahin maanate
 Experts may have their own opinions but the audience wants something different from the routine
 tabhi to kabhi tivi par reality sho apana karnama dikhaate hai or kabhi dharmik serials
 Shubham Tiwari, a student at Delhi University, says, "the same serials connect that fit in the current environment as well
" aap dekhen, mahabharat kaa harek paatr hamaare aas-paas mil jayega
 "where today, everywhere from politics to self-interest, and the saints have lost their way and the game is being played by a woman, we get a similar view in the Mahabharata

 Sociologist Anand Kumar also sees the success of these serials by connecting them to the family
 sagar arts ke shiv sagar kii raay main, ‘‘maa-baap chaahate hai ki unke bachche in serials ko dekhen or acchhee baaten seekhen
 It is the desire of the audience that these characters are presented in different ways again and again
 ’’agar saare pahaluon par gaur farmaaen to yahi soch nikalakar aati he ki channel aisi kahaniyaan bana rahe hai jinase aam aadmi prerit ho or unke jivan main kuch badlaav aa saken
 As far as the audience is concerned, their numbers are constantly increasing

 Recently, he publicly announced a moratorium to make his 19-year-old son Shaban Bukhari the Naib Imam of Jama Masjid
 is samaaroh main pradhanmantri narendra modi ko chhodkar desh-duniya ke logon ko aamantrit kiya or 22 november ko unhone jama masjid parisar main bhavy samaaroh yojit kar jataa diya ki 17veen sadi main bani is masjid par maano sirf unheen kaa haq he
 While trying to prove the private event of the Imam to be organized by the entire Muslim community, his supporter Shahid Raza gave him a political color
 unhone kaha ki 400 saal kii parampara ko todgaye nahin diya jayega or kisi ne musalamaanon ke khilaaf sajeesh kii to kanoon unke juuton kii nok par hoga
 Arguing at the stubbornness and imposition of the ban, Sawalbukhari did not deliberately invite Prime Minister Modi while announcing the Dharbandi ceremony to habitually raise a controversy
 unhone padosi desh pakistan ke pradhanmantri navaj sharif ko nyotaa diya
 Although he argued not to call Modi, "modi still represents a certain class"
 ham kise daavat bhejein yaa nahin, yah hamaara nijee maamla he
 While the Waqf Board in the Delhi High Court clearly stated that Jama Masjid is of Waqf and Bukhari is its staff
 hycourt ne bukhari samet sabhi pakshon ko notice jari karte hue 28 janvari, 2015 tak jawaab maanga he
 But the court has also made it clear that the final decision will be applicable to whoever is being appointed as Naib Imam

 "even Islamic law does not recognize this prohibition

 Suhail Ahmed Khan, a businessman and RTI activist who has filed a petition against detention in the High Court, says, "ahmad Bukhari has made fun of the High Court

 bukhari ne kabhi na to kanoon ko mana he or na maanenge
 "(people offering namaz after the rituals in the grand event) but the administration and the court? Actually, this is not the first case of Bukhari openly challenging the law

 Social activist Arshad Ali Fahmi, who lives near the mosque, attacked his house when he sought the account of the mosque's income through a poster campaign
 yah maamla adaalat main he, lekin saman ke baad bhi ve kabhi adaalat main pesh nahin hue
 Similarly, in July 2012, while hearing a case in September 2001, the court made a scathing remark as the police had made him a prosecution witness instead of executing the non-bailable warrant issued against Bukhari
 bukhari ke hajir nahin hone par metrpolitan magistrate rajinder singh ko apane aadesh main kahana padaa tha, ‘‘meri yah suvichaarit dharna he ki maamle main aaropee ahamed bukhari ko wadamaf gavaah bananaa kanoon kaa majaak udaana or unhen bachaav kaa aasaan rasta dena he
 The police has failed to execute the non-bailable warrant issued against Bukhari by the court
 ’’sawaalon ke ghere main badhati sampattisuhel bataate hai ki 1976 main ahamed bukhari ke pita jab imam the to unhen mahaj 179 ru
 Salary was available
 haalanki ve bukhari kii sampatti ab hajaaron karod ru
 Claims to be Ki, but has no concrete evidence to confirm this
 unhone hycourt se maang kii he ki bukhari kii sampatti kahaan se ai, isaki jaanch karai jaani chahie
 He alleges that Bukhari's wealth is spread not only in India, but his hotels and businesses are spread all over Mecca and Medina
 unki shaano-shaukat ke bare main bukhari parivaar ke ek kareebi bataate hai, ‘‘khud prado kii gaadi main chalate hai, beton ke paas marcides or anya badi gadibhan hai
 India Today tried to talk to Imam Bukhari about the allegations against him but he flatly refused to speak about it
 masjid kii sampatti kaa hisaab nahinmasjid kii aamadani ke hisaab ko lekar aksar vakf board or shahi imam ke bich takaraav kii naubat surkhiyaan banati he
 But the question arises that what happens to the income of Jama Masjid? Says Matin Ahmed, "the property belongs to the Waqf Board, but is looked after only by Imam Bukhari
 vakf kii sampatti hone ke lihaaj se aamadani kaa 7 fisadi hissaa board ko milanaa chahie
 But do not get
 ’’jabaki saamaajik kaaryakarta fahmi or suhail, donon kaa daawa he ki sailaaniyon se hone vaali aamadani or avaidh parking se hone vaali vasuuli aadi ko milakar masjid kii rojaanaa kii aamadani kareeb 3
 5 to 4 lakhs
 kii he
 There is no slip in the name of Waqf Board
 pichley saal bijli bill ko lekar bhi imam or board main takaraav ho chukaa he
 Then Bukhari said that if the mosque was given in his name then he 4
 16 karod ru
 Will pay the electricity bill of Rs
 atikaraman se badahaalishahjahanabad yaa puraani dilli main masjid jahaan numa yaa jama masjid shahjahan ne banavaai thi
 The ancestors of Ahmad Bukhari were called Shahi Imams during the reign of the king
 badshahath or angreji hukumat khatm hone tathaa desh main loktantr aane ke baavjood imam se pehle ‘‘shahi’’ lagane kaa chalan bana rahaa
 But perhaps the "royal" Imam has no control over the situation around the mosque
 sthaneey vidhayak shueb ikbaal kehete hai, ‘‘shahi get ke paas minaa bazaar vaali jagah kii haalat to bahut buree he
 All the strange types of crime are there
 isamen police kaa bada haath rahata he
 "the Imam's younger brother Yahya Bukhari has also said," illegitimate works are being done around the mosque around the world
 masjid kii suraksha kaa koi intjaam nahin he
 One can easily target the terror mosque
 ’’beasar hote fatvejama masjid apni dharmik pahchaan se zyada siyaasi fatvon kii vajah se charchaa main rahane lagi he or maujuuda imam to rajnatik fatve dene main record tod rahe hai
 Rajya Sabha MP Chaudhary Munawwar Salim says, "the Imam's job is to teach namaz in the religious nukta-e-nazar, but Bukhari is probably the Tanha Imam of Hindustan who also issues a political edict
 unke fatve hameshaa rajnatik swaarthon ke tahat hote hai
 Sometimes BJP, sometimes Congress, sometimes SP, sometimes BSP, there is no party in India in whose favor Bukhari has not issued a fatwa
 ’’ congress mahasachiv digvijay singh bukhari ko ‘‘sampradayik jhukaav vaala vyakti’’ qaraar de chuke hai
 He had said, "bukhari is the same person who praised Osama bin Laden and protested against his assassination and in 2004 voted for the BJP
 ’’2012 ke upi vidhansabha chunaav main imam bukhari ne sapa ke paksh main fatwa jari kiya, lekin behat seat se unke damaad umr kii jamaanat jabt ho gai
 But even after this defeat, Bukhari made the son-in-law a member of the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Council and Wasim, the son of his friend Haji Munna, chairman of the State Pollution Control Board, under pressure from the status of his Imamat
 bukhari parivaar se jude ek kareebi vyakti bataate hai, ‘‘damaad ko emelsi or wasim ahamed khan ko board chairman banavaane ke liye bukhari ne mulaayam singh yadav ke 20 chakkar lagaae
 "but when Wasim was removed from the board, Bukhari rallied in Mulayam's home town of Etawah and then started calling him anti-muslim, so that" there would be a bargain
 ’’desh ke musalamaanon kii baat to dur bukhari kaa jama masjid ilaake ke musalamaanon ke bich bhi khaas pakad nahin lagati
 Shoaib Iqbal has been representing the public for the last 20 years despite the opposition of Imam Bukhari
 matiamhal vidhansabha seat se vidhayak ikbaal ne 1998 main loksabhaa chunaav bhi ladaa tha, jisamen unhen kareeb 70,000 vot mili the, lekin agle saal 1999 ke chunaav main unhone ahamed bukhari se haath mila liya
 But surprisingly, instead of increasing Shueb's vote, around 12,000 votes were reduced
 isliye ab ve bukhari se apni duuri banaakar rakhte hai
 When asked, he says, "one or two have fatwa against me too, but Aavam decides in his own way
" ’’upi sarkaar main varisht mantri ajam khan to hikaarat bhare lahaze main kehete hai, ‘‘ye janaab jis ilaake main rahete hai vahaan ek parshad tak nahin jita sakate
 The front man becomes an MLA by climbing on his chest
 musalamaanon par inaki kitni pakad he, isaki isse badi misaal kya hogi ki inke damaad uttar pradesh main seat number ek jahaan sabase zyada musalmaan hai, vahaan jamaanat bhi nahin bachaa paae
 "the well-wishers or exploiters of Muslims? The Bukhari family has a special importance in the religion of Islam, so Shah Jahan called this family from Bukhara (uzbekistan)
" lekin bukhari ne gujarat dangon ke baad bhi bijepi ke liye fatwa jari kiya
 After an High Court verdict on the Ayodhya issue, an Urdu newspaper journalist Mo at a Lucknow press conference
 abdul vaahid chishti ne sawaal poocha to bukhari bhadak gaye or use maarane ke liye lapke
 The extent was reached when Bukhari called Chaudhary Munawwar Salim, the only Muslim MP out of seven elected to the Rajya Sabha from SP, as lula-lame, blind
 imam bukhari kii daastaan yaheen khatm hoti nahin dikhti
 According to habit, he gives a statement on every such issue, which has no relation with religion
 dilli gangrape peedita jab maut se jujh rahi thi tab upi sarkaar ne sara medical kharch uthaane kaa elaan kiya to yah bhi bukhari ko raas nahin aayaa
 He also expressed concern with religion that such assistance was never given to any Muslim rape victim
 ek khatarnaak sampradayikta ko badhaava dene kii unki koshish sirf balaatkaar peedita ke maamle main hi nahin dikhi, balki bhrashtachar ke khilaaf anna hajaare ke andolan ko bhi ve muslim virdohi bataakar kaum ko usase dur rahane kii apil kar chuke hai
 On August 22, 2011, he had said that in the movement, slogans of Vande Mataram and Bharat Mata Ki Jai (salute to Madare Watan in Urdu) are being opposed to Islam
 us vakt bukhari ne aarope lagaaya ki team anna main shaamil vakil gujarat dange main narendra modi kii bhoomika kaa bachaav karte rahe hai
 But here Bukhari forgot that he issued a fatwa for the same BJP in 2004 after the riots
 prashasan se takaraav mol lene kii unki aadat nai nahin he
 During the NDA regime, in May 2003, when the then Tourism and Culture Minister Jagmohan took the initiative to remove encroachment in the Jama Masjid area, the Imam challenged Jagmohan by writing a threatening letter, "show us the steps of the mosque
" ’’imam kaa kaam masjid main namaaj padhaanaa he or apane aacharan se logon ko islam kii saadagi ke prati kaayal karnaa he
 In the Islamic-ruled countries, the Imam does not have the least permission to interfere in politics
 lekin bhartiya loktantr main imamat kii aad main siyasat kii chhot he
 The cabinet gave permission to close the Janpath Hotel of the Indian Tourism Development Corporation ITDC in the capital
 ab is sampatti kaa upyog sarkari daftar ke liye kiya jayega
 In a meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in-principle approval was given to handover the property of Hotel Janpath to the Ministry of Urban Development
 ek aadhikarik bayaan ke mutabik, janpath hotel dilli shahar ke posh ilaake main sthit he
 Its assets can be used for the construction of government offices or other similar work which will save the government funds in the expenses of the offices hired for the official work
 hotel janpath ko band karne kaa nirnay sarkaar ne aitidisi ke bhopal, guwahati or bharatpur sthit hotalon se baahar aane ke faisle ke ek maheene ke bheetar liya he
 The specifics of the land use of its property and the implementation of the project will be considered by a committee of secretaries headed by the Cabinet Secretary
 conot place se satee 4 acre kii is jameen ko abshahari kalyaan mantralayake adheen kar diya jayega jisapar vah sarkari offis, kanvension centre athwa sarkari karmchaariyon ke liye awaas banane kaa faisla le sakati he
 According to the reports published on the basis of sources in the media, the Ministry of Urban Welfare is also working on a plan to bring housing scheme for Central Government officials and employees on this land
 haalanki kendra sarkaar main hi kuch logon kaa daawa he ki mantralay ko is prime land par sarkari awaas banane kii jagah ek kanvension centre banane par gambhirtha se sochna chahie
 Why not a hotel instead of a hotel? The hotel problem in the country's capital, Delhi, was revealed when the Commonwealth Games were held in Delhi in 2010
 is samay yah saaf tha ki jab kaamanwealth games jaise event karaane main desh kii rajdhani sakasham nahin he to bhala bhavishya main olympic khelon kaa aayojan karne kii daavedaari kaise kii jaaegi? The Government of Bihar is now alert for the safety of school children
 sarkaar ab schuli bacchon kii suraksha or unke sangrakshan ke liye shikshakon ko na keval prashikshit kar rahi he, balki vibhageeya adhikariyon ko iske liye niyamavali kaa draftitaiyaar karne kaa nirdesh diya gaya he
 State Project Director of Bihar Education Project Council (BEPC) Sanjay Singh said on Wednesday that the authorities have been asked to prepare a draft of the rules for the protection and protection of children of all schools, including private schools
 is draft ke aadhaar par rajya sarkaar se vichaar-vimarsh ke baad ise kanoon ke rup main lagu kiya ja sake
 Singh said that apart from discharging the obligation in this manual, provision of punishment will be made
 draft main sabhi chizon kaa spasht ullekh karne kaa bhi nirdesh diya gaya he
 He informed that BEPC is also training teachers to learn the tricks of child safety in collaboration with UNICEF
 unhone kaha ki pratham charan main prashikshit karne ke liye rajya ke sabhi nau pramandalon se paanch-paanch shikshakon kaa chayan kiya gaya he
 After receiving the training, all these teachers will train other teachers at the district level
 unhone bataaya ki is modul ke aadhaar par agle saal janvari se march tak rajya ke kareeb 5800 madhyamik or ucch madhyamik skulon ke do-do shikshakon ko prashikshit karne kii yojana he
 According to wikileaks, the son of Al Qaeda's slain chief Osama bin Laden sought his death certificate from the US after his father's death, but the US refused to release it
 haal hi main kareeb vikililk ne 70 hajaar paper apni website par daale hai
 It is claimed to be associated with all Saudi Arabian government
 inhen kaagajon main osama ke bete abdulla bin laden kii vah chitthee bhi he, jisamen usne america se aagrah kiya he ki uske pita kaa deth certificate use diya jaae
 In response to a letter from Laden's son, US Council General Glenn Keyser wrote in Riyadh on 9 September 2011, according to wikileaks papers, "we have received a request for the release of your father's death certificate
" lekin kanoonee salaahkaaron ke mutabik, ham aisa certificate jari nahin kar sakate
 " kijar ne osama kii maut ko ek encounter bataate hue kaha tha uskaa deth certificate nahin diya ja saktaa
 Keizer said Osama has a death record in the US court, in which there is official confirmation of his death
 lihaaja hamane uske upar lage saare criminal cese waapas le liye hai
 The comments osama bin laden kaa betaa arab main bada bijnesaman he
 But in 1994, the Saudi Arabian government took away Osama's citizenship
 ullekhneey he ki 2 may 2011 ko pakistan ke abtabad main chhavnee seemaa ke kareeb america nausena ke sil commando ne ek karrwai main laden ko uske ek thikaane par maar giraaya tha
 Recently, about 70,000 papers have been put on its website by wikileelk
 yah sabhi saudi arab sarkaar se jude hone kaa daawa kiya he
 These papers also include a letter from Osama's son Abdullah bin Laden, in which he has urged the US to give him his father's death certificate
 vikiliks ke kaagajon ke anusaar laden ke bete ke khat ke jawaab main 9 sitambar 2011 ko riyaad main yues council general glen kijar ne likhaa, “hamen aapaki pita ke deth certificate jari karne ke maang sambandhi arji mili he
 But according to legal advisors, we cannot issue such a certificate
 ” Keizer said Osama's death was an encounter and said that his death certificate could not be given
 kijar ne kaha ki america court main osama kii maut kaa record he, jisamen uski maut kii adhikarik pushti hoti he
 So we have withdrawn all the criminal cases on him
 tippaniyan Osama bin Laden's son is a big businessman in Arabia

 It is noteworthy that on 2 May 2011, US Navy SEAL commandos killed bin Laden at one of his hideouts near the cantonment border in Abbottabad, Pakistan

 5 startamil and director in the Telugu industry Chakri Toletti have made a few films
 uske baad 2017 main tamanna bhaatia ke saath khamoshi naam kii hindi film bhi chakri ne diarect kii
 Chakri has worked as a director as well as an actor
 ab unhone bahut badi star cast ke saath hindi film welcome tu neuyork banaai he
 If you plan to go to the film, then know its story
 paise kii kami se singer bane the dilajit, sirf 10veen paskahanefilm kii kahani neuyork main hone vaale ifa awards se shuru hoti hai jiske liye ek kantest rakhaa jaataa he or 2 logon ko contest ke dwaara chunakar ifa awards main aane kaa mauka miltaa he
 The first person is Teji Sandhu (diljit Dosanjh), who is very fond of acting and is always seen acting, while the second selected girl is Genel Patel (sonakshi Sinha) who works as a tailor
 teji or jeenal ipha awards dekhne ke liye neuyork pahunchate hai to vahaan kaarykram ke aayojakon (baman irani or lara datta bhupati) ke bich pehle se hi aapasi nonkajhonk hoti he, vahiin dusre trek par karan (karnaa johar) or arjuna (karan johar) ke bich kii dushmani kahani main badlaav laati he
 Too many twist turns and eventually a result
 kyon dekh sakate hai filmaritesh deshmukh or dilajit aapako sabase zyada hansaate hai
 Karan Johar is in double role, the confusions of Rana Daggubatti's Bhalal Jokes, Sushant Singh Rajput considering Dhoni, Diljit Dosanjh's excessive filming makes the film fun
 sonakshi ne bhi thikthak kaam kiya he
 Baman Irani and Lara Dutta have also acted spontaneously

 This film is beyond logic
 vahiin film ke gaanon ne bhi relies se pehle koi sarpraij nahin diya he
 This is why most audiences will wait to see it on TV
 ek tarah se award sho ke dauraan hi filmakan karke ek panth do kaaj vaala kaam karne kii koshish kii gai he lekin wo puri tarah se naakaam lagati he
 It could have become a very good film because it had completely Bollywood actors' visuals but they say that despite being a very good batsman and fastest bowler, sometimes your team loses
 vaisaa hi kuch welcome to neuyok ke saath hua he
 Despite the presence of actors like Salman Khan, Sushant Singh Rajput, Karan Johar, Diljit Dosanjh in a double role, the film disappoints
 welcome tu neuyork: gane se sikhon kii bhavanaaen aahat, dilajit par firboyksa offisfilm kaa bajet lagbhag 30 karod bataaya ja rahaa he jisamen production cost 20 karod or 10 karod kaa promotional cost he

 Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) vice-president Shivanand Tiwari has claimed that Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar sent a message that he does not feel comfortable in an alliance with the BJP
 aapako bataa den ki kuch din pehle hi argedy ne khule manch se nitish kumaar kaa swaagat karne kii bhi baat kahi he
 Significantly, there has been fierce rhetoric between BJP and JDU in the meantime
 saal 2015 main argedy ke saath milakar chunaav jeetne vaale jediu netaa nitish kumaar ne dedh saal main hi mahagathbandhan se khud ko alag kar bijepi ke saath milakar sarkaar bana lee thi
 Initially everything went well, but after this many differences have emerged
 piem modi ke duusare kaarykaal ke shuru hote hi rishton main or talkhi aa gai he
 However, BJP President Amit Shah has said that the election will be contested in Bihar under Nitish Kumar
 lekin rishte itane bhi sahaj hote nahin dikhaai de rahe hai
 Meanwhile, RJD leader Shivanand Tiwari has once again tried to give a hint to this Nitish by writing a blog
 padhein puraa blog :'bhartiya janata party (BJP) bihar main akele bahumat hasil karne kii haisiyat ab tak nahin bana pai he
 The BJP will contest the next assembly elections in Bihar under the leadership of Nitish Kumar Kumar
 amit shah ke bayaan se ab yah spasht ho gaya he
 Recently, the way the leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party attacked Nitish Kumar, especially regarding water logging, there was a feeling that these people are no longer going to tolerate Nitish Kumar
 amit shah ke bayaan ke baad vaise log jo netritv main badlaav kaa shor machaa rahe the, ab chup ho jaaenge
 Nitish Kumar was also very clever in creating confusion about the alliance
 ham logon ke yahaan unka sandeshaa aayaa ki us gathbandhan main ve sahaj mahasoos nahin kar rahe hai 
 His so-called secular soul is there to curse him
 ham log unke jhaanse main aa gaye or saarvajanik rup se unka swaagat kar diya
 It would also have played a role behind Amit Shah's announcement about Nitish Kumar's leadership

 ’’ 40 out of 44 mlas of the state Congress are staying in Jaipur amidst the pull of government in Maharashtra
 in sabhi vidhayakon ke rukne kaa intjaam mukhyamantri ashok gahalot ne kiya he
 According to the information received, they have all reached Jaipur on Sunday
 ravivaar ko yah sabhi vidhayak amer kaa kila gaye
 Senior Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge came to Jaipur to meet all these mlas
 party ke varisht netaa aise mahole main apane sabhi vidhayakon ko ek saath rakhane kii koshishon main jute hai
 Senior Congress leaders are keeping an eye on all these mlas
 udhar,maharashtra main shivasena ke saath sarkaar banane ko lekar congress ne party varking cameti (CWC) kii baithak ab khatm ho gai he
 After leaving the meeting, senior party leader Mallikarjun Kharge said that the right aspects have been discussed in this meeting which started from 10 am
 aakhir main party kevarisht netaaonne yah tay kiya he ki ham maharashtra congress ke netaaon ke saath baithak karne ke baad hi kisi faisle par pahunchenge
 He said that the party has called senior leaders of Maharashtra Congress for a meeting at four in the evening
 bataa den ki maharashtra main BJP sarkaar nahin banaaegi yah ab saaf ho gaya he
 In such a situation, everyone's eyes are now towards Shiv sena-congress and NCP
 NCP pramukh sharad pavaarane Shiv Sena ke saath sarkaar banane kii sambhaavnaaon ko lekar bada bayaan diya he
 He said that we are not going to take any decision to form the government without talking to the Congress
 udhar, congress party ne maharashtra ke maujuuda raajnneetik halaat ko lekar CWC kii baithak bulaai he

 in sab ke bich,centre kii modi sarkaar main shaamil shivasena ke iklaute mantri arvind saavant ne istife kaa elaan kiya he
 Giving details of the resignation decision on Twitter, he said that Shiv Sena's side is the truth
 jhuthe maahaul ke saath nahin rahaa saktaa he
 Arvind Sawant said that he would press conference on this at 11 am
 yah faisla aise main unhone kiya he jab maharashtra main shivasena, congress or ensipi kii sarkaar banane kii khabaren hai
 With the announcement of Arvind Sawant's resignation, it has been decided that the Shiv Sena is out of the NDA
 shivasena or bijepi kii dosti 30 saal puraani thi
 It is believed that the NCP had put a condition before the Shiv Sena to form a government in Maharashtra that it would have to break ties with the NDA first
 haalanki maharashtra main shivasena or ensipi ko sarkaar banane ke liye congress ke bhi samarthan jarurat padegi
 But Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge has said that the meeting is going to be held at 10 o'clock today and the decision will be taken according to the instructions of the high command
 lekin uske saath hi unhone kaha ki abhi tak kaa jo faisla he ki hamen vipaksh main hi baithna chahie
 Let us tell you that in the Maharashtra Assembly elections, BJP has got 105 seats, Shiv Sena 56, NCP 54 and Congress 44 seats
 bijepi or shivasena ne milakar bahumat kaa 145 kaa aankada paar kar liya tha
 But Shiv Sena kept demanding 50-50 formula according to which the model of running the government was two and a half years
 shivasena kaa kahana he ki bijepi ke saath samjhauta isi formule par hua tha lekin bijepi kaa daawa he ki aisa koi samjhauta nahin hua
 This led to differences so much that the two-year old friendship of the two parties was broken

 ) The issue of dismissal of the Chief of Army Staff in Nepal is getting deeper
 senadhyaksh ko hataane ke virodh main chah mantriyon ne istipha de diya he
 While the army is on alert, the Maoist guerrillas have also taken command of any situation
 masalankisi bhi vakt nepal main shuru ho saktaa he khooni khel
 There is a chill between Maoist leader and Nepal's Prime Minister Prachanda and Nepal's President Ram Baran Yadav
 is dushmani kii vajah bane hai senadhyaksh katwal
 Prime Minister Prachanda had recommended President Ram Baran Yadav to remove Katwal
 lekin raashtrapati ne unki sifarish ko khaarij kar diya
 There were many reasons for this
 darasal senadhyaksh katwal kaa sena par kadaa niyantran he
 He also has a good grip on intelligence
 phir katwal ko hataane kii koi thos vajah bhi nahin thi
 Also, the President does not want the command of the army to go to the Maoists
 senadhyaksh ko naa hataane ke faisle ke baad pradhanmantri pranchad or raashtrapati ram baran yadav main than gai
 The Nepal government announced the dismissal of Katwal from the post
 lekin sarkaar ke is faisle ke khilaaf sena pramukh rukmangad katwal ne baghawat kaa jhanda buland kar diya
 Narendra Modi's second innings as Prime Minister is going to start tomorrow (may 30)
 isse pehle har taraf charchaa is baat ko lekar he ki modi kii nai team main kis-kis ko jagah milegi
 The top leadership of the BJP is also going on a row over the cabinet
 mangalvaar ko pradhanmantri awaas main saadhe chaar ghante se zyada narendra modi or amit shah ke bich gahan vimarsh hua
 It is believed that today the picture on the cabinet will be completely clear and it will be known that how many new faces are to be included in the Modi cabinet and how many old faces will be given a chance again
 haalanki, ab tak koi bhi netaa is vishay par vichaar rakhane ko raji nahin he
 In fact, when Narendra Modi addressed all 353 NDA mps in the Central Hall of Parliament after getting a strong majority in the Lok Sabha elections, Modi also referred to the Cabinet
 is dauraan modi ne saansadon ko naseehat dete hue kaha ki bahut log mantri banavaane main lage hue hai, lekin kisi ko gumraah hone kii jarurat nahin he
 Even PM Modi had said that if any MP gets a call from the Headquarters regarding becoming a minister, then also verify it, because many times false calls are also made
 aaj kaa din kuch aisa hi he, jab sambhavit mantriyon ko bulaava bheja jayega
 Since the oath-taking ceremony is to take place tomorrow (7 pm), it can be assumed that by this evening, the mps who are being given a place in the cabinet will be informed
 40 fisadi nae chehron ko mil saktaa he maukamana ja rahaa he ki narendra modi ke netritv vaali endie kii nai sarkaar main kai diggaj or maujuuda mantriyon ko jagah nahin milegi or 40 fisadi nae chehron ko shaamil kiya jayega
 Two of the current ministers included in the CCS (cabinet Committee on Security) may be discharged, replacing new and relatively young faces
 bijepi sutron ke mutabik, is baar desh ko nayaa vitt, raksha or videsh mantri mil saktaa he
 It is likely that Arun Jaitley would not like to become a minister this time due to health reasons
 baharhaal, kiski chuttee hoti he or kise entry milti he, yah tasviir bahut jald saaf ho jaaegi
 Because there is a marathon meeting on the Cabinet in the meeting of Narendra Modi and Amit Shah late at 5 pm on Tuesday evening
 ab dekhnaa hoga ki modi kii nai team main kis player kaa bhagya saath detaa he

 Addressing a press conference, Kejriwal said that it is being considered to be implemented every fortnight, as it cannot be sustainable without a strong public transport system
 sam-visham pranali jo rashtriya rajdhani main ek baar phir se 15 april se lagu hoga, usamen pehle charan kii tulana main ekmaatr bada badlaav ye he ki skool uniform main bacchon ko le ja rahi car ko isse chhot rahegi
 Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said in a press conference that vips, CNG cars, women-run cars, emergency medical conditions and cars carrying people with disabilities will be exempted from this rule
 kejariwal ne is baat ko sweekaar kiya ki skool unifarm main bacchon ko le jane vaali kaaron ko chhot ke daayre main rakhana thodaa mushkil he, kyonki aise sabhi vaahan bacchon ko skool se waapas laane ke liye khadey nahin rah sakate
 The comments mukhyamantri ne kaha, 'is maamalon main do chijen ho sakati hai
 In the first case, a vehicle leaves the child at school, stands there and returns the child

 The odd-even system, which will be implemented once again in the national capital from April 15, is the only major change compared to the first phase that the car carrying children in the school uniform will be exempt from it

 Kejriwal acknowledged that it is a little difficult to keep the cars carrying children in school uniforms exempt, as not all such vehicles can stand to bring children back from school
 tippaniyan The Chief Minister said, 'two things can happen in this case
 pehle maamle main ek vaahan bachche ko skool main chodta he, vahiin khadaa rahata he or bachche ko waapas lekar lautataa he

 Banaskantha district of north Gujarat was the most affected by the floods in Gujarat last week
 haalanki baadh main insaanon ne to apane aap ko kisi tarah bachaa liya, lekin hajaaron dudharu pashu is prakruthik prakope main maare gaye
 The dairy industry in this district is being severely affected by the death of a large number of animals
 baadh main sarkari aankade ke mutabik hi kareeb 7000 pashu maare gaye hai
 However, if people believe, the number of animals killed can be three times this, because in most cases people have not informed the government about their dead animals
 philhal survey kaa kaam chal hi rahaa he
 The dairy industry here has been the most affected due to the killing of animals
 ullekhneey he ki banaaskantha jila sirf gujarat main hi nahin balki puure desh main sabase zyada doodh utpaadan karne vaala jila mana jaataa he
 According to officials of the Gujarat Milk Marketing Federation, which sells milk from all the milk cooperatives of Gujarat in the name of 'amul', about 33 lakh liters of milk is coming daily from Banaskantha district itself
 jab se baadh ai, tab se doodh utpaadan main baari kami ai he
 The comments baadh ke shuruyaat ke do dinon main mushkil se 4 lakh litre doodh aa rahaa tha
 After the flooding, milk production gradually increased
 ab jab baadh kaa asar khatm ho gaya he tab bhi mushkil se 21 lakh litre hi doodh aa rahaa he
 That is, about 12 lakh liters less milk is already coming
 isaki mukhya vajah pashuon kii maut se doodh utpaadan main ai kami he
 Although Gujarat's Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation claims that it will not allow milk supply to decline in the country, Banaskantha will take a long time to reach its peak of milk production again

 It is worth mentioning that Banaskantha district is considered to be the highest milk producing district not only in Gujarat but in the whole country

 Ever since the flood, there has been a huge reduction in milk production
 tippaniyan There were barely 4 lakh liters of milk in the two days of the onset of the flood
 baadh utarane ke baad dhire-dhire doodh utpaadan kramshah badhata gaya
 Now that the effects of the flood have ended, barely 21 lakh liters of milk is coming
 yani pehle se kareeb 12 lakh litre kam doodh aa rahaa he
 The main reason is the decrease in milk production due to animal deaths
 haalanki gujarat ko aaparative milk marketing federation kaa daawa he ki vah desh main doodh supplai main kami nahin aane degaa, lekin banaaskantha ko dobaaraa apane doodh utpaadan ke charam par pahunchane main kaaphi vakt lag jayega

 mahaan hastiyon kii suchi bataai gai jisamen pandit jawaharlal nehru to nahin lekin guru golwalkar shaamil the
 However, on this issue, Nitin Dubey of the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha called it meaningless and said that his aim is to convey the idea of pandit Deendayal who is his ideal
 vahiin, sahakaarita mantri vishwaas saarang ne kaha, hamaari koshish kisi ko hataane kii nahin, nehru ne congress ne bahut prachaar kiya wo bahut prachaarit hai

 Youth Congress President Kunal Chaudhary said that robbing government money is the way to sponsor Godse's ideology
 madhya pradesh berozegaron kaa pradesh he yahaan coffee vid siem ke jagah rojgaar kii jarurat he
 The competition was attended by students from eighth to twelfth and college whose age is below 35 years

 13 thousand private and retired teachers also engaged in conducting the examination
 41 sawaal bacchon ko dedh ghante main sulajhane the
 The title was Mere Deendayal General Knowledge but most of the 9 questions focused on the state government and its achievements
 4 pandit dinadayal par, haalanki kuch bacchon se jab hamane dinadayal ji ke bare main sawaal kiya to kisi ne kaha use yaad nahin, kisi ne kaha unhen kuch nahin bataaya gaya

 An email has come that even if i keep listening to the schools for a month, it will not make any difference, because the school consists of leaders and officials
 adaalaton ke aadesh bhi nahin maanate
 i accept that this is true of them, but nowadays the leaders will have to come to the question of arbitrariness of schools
 bhale hi unki party ke netaaon ke skool chalate hai or vahaan se kaale dhan kii supplai hoti he lekin jis tarah se desh bhar main abhibhavak sangh sakriy ho rahaa he, yah bahut din tak chalegaa nahin
 In the emails that are coming to us, new words are being added about private schools
 hamane kai email padhe hai
 If a leader is teaching them and starts the politics of arbitrary schooling then it can become quite popular
 in email ko padhate hue pataa chal rahaa he ki maa-baap chup nahin hai
 They are writing letters from District Magistrate to Chief Minister, Judges to Prime Minister
 karrwai nahin ho rahi he, wo alag baat he
 The orders are passed but do not apply but it is not that parents do not want to be free from this slavery of schools
 email ko padhakar laga ki maa-baap par vaaki aarthik dabaav he
 His salary in private jobs is now increasing at a low speed but the pace of increase in fees in schools is quite fast
 isliye kai maa baap samay par do bachche kii fees nahin de pate to let fees bharani padati he
 We have received many emails regarding late fees
 punjab ke navanshahar, rajasthan kii bundi, bihar ke kishanganj, dumriyaganj, gaya, sasaram, muzaffarpur se patr aae hai
 Many people have also emailed from Asansol, Kolkata, Bengal
 vishakhapattanam se bhi patr aa rahe hai
 Emails have come from Barhampur, Bargarh in Odisha
 rajasthan ke jhunjhanu se bhi patr aayaa he
 Email has come from almost every area of delhi
 upi ke renukut, nawabganj, pilibhit se patr aayaa he
 By reading these letters, it is felt that there is no difference in the fees of schools from Delhi to Jhunjhunu and from Berhampur to Bastar, while there is a difference in the earning in these places
 zaahir he maa baap par dabaav badhegaa hi
 Governments cannot ignore their problem
 bihar ke kishanganj se gautam ne likhaa he ki fees se tang aakar bachche ko privet skool se hataa hi liya
 In many places the parents have had to change the school but there is also a problem
 puure teen maheene kii fees jamaa karai gai he tab jaakar transfar certificate diye gaye hai
 It is all in people's emails
 ek patr aayaa he ki 2013 main coshan mani ke taur par 44000 rupee jamaa karaae the
 But when the decision was made to change the school due to increase in fees, only 6000 were returned
 38,000 rupee admician fee ke naam par skool ne kaat liye
 At the time of admission, it was said that the citation money would be fully refunded
 yah sahi he ki maa baap isaki shikaayat karte hai magar sunwaayee nahin hoti
 There are also demonstrations outside the schools, but no one listens, but there are stories of looting that cannot be called right in the name of a good private school
 kuch nahin ho saktaa to inhen suna hi jaae
 Students in 9th and 10th are emailing us, so i don't believe nothing will happen
 kuch nahin hoga to ye samaaj kii haar hogi, meri nahin
 We have sorted a few tales of loot even today by email
 banaras ke ek skool ne diary ke 800 rupee liye hai
 a school in Sasaram added the price of the book to the school's receipt even after purchasing the book online
 bhavnagar kaa ek skool 25000 cash letaa he magar dhai hazaar kii raseed detaa he
 a school in Damoh, Madhya Pradesh is offering a science book for Rs 595
 kolkata ke ek skool ne bag ke liye 2000 rupee liye hai
 a school of 80 rupees is being taken for 300 rupees
 jaipur kaa ek skool jarnal ke naam par sabhi chaatr se anivaary rup se 1000 rupee letaa he
 This journal contains rubbish in the name of inspiring stories
 ek parivaar kaa do baccha padhata he to ek hi jarnal ke liye 2000 dene padate hai
 a school is charging Rs 500 per student in the name of Saraswati Puja
 nagad fees lene kii khub shikaayat he
 In view of this, the Prime Minister must take a look
 unke ek aadesh se yah sambhav ho saktaa he ki skulon main kuch bhi lenden cash na ho, balki skulon main jinke bachche pard rahe hai wo pradhanmantri ke cashlesh abhiyaan kii har din pariksha lete hai
 Therefore, the government should also be extra active and sensitive about this
 kai baar acchhee niyat se liya gaya faisla ulta bhi pad jaataa he
 An email from Aurangabad in Maharashtra states that the city does not have a public transport system
 kamishnar ne tay kar diya ki aato main 4 or vine main 10 se adhik bachche nahin jaaenge
 Since there is no bus, now the van had to be given 1200 instead of 500 as the van was charging more
 aisa chakra he ki faisla aata bhi he to fansaa jaataa he
 Now ask yourself a question
 skool kyon tay karegaa ki aap kis brands kaa juuta pahanenge
 An email has come from UP
 usamen likhaa he ki footvier company ne kai skool khol liye hai
 His shoes are essentially sold in all schools and at a higher price
 anushaasan ke naam par mahange or videshi brands ke juute kyon pahanane chahie
 Does not discipline come from simplicity, does discipline come from expensive brands, black shoes have to be worn, so why should students not buy from their capacity? Who is going to school decides that you buy an expensive brand shoe in 2000
 kya skool main padhane vaale sabhi maa baap kii kshamta ek hi hoti he
 a school in Raipur forces them to buy expensive brand shoes
 skool ke bacchon ke liye koi chhot nahin hoti he
 The email states that they have been charged more than the rest of the cities
 tippaniyan Even the one who understands and the one who does not understand, understand one thing in simple Hindi
 ise ghulaami kehete hai
 You have been enslaved
 schoolo ne juuton kii bikri ke liye tarah tarah ke tikadam kiye hai jinhen ham bina dimag lagaae sweekaar kar rahe hai
 We should ask who is he becoming a disciplined citizen by wearing foreign brand shoes in school
 anushaasan ke naam par wo gulam naagarik ban rahaa he
 This thing is serious even if it is serious even after we listen to it for a month

 An email has come from Kolkata that the nursery child has been forced to buy an expensive brand shoe which costs Rs 2000
 haal hi main gujarat ke shiksha mantri ne kaha he ki skool itani donneton le rahe hai ki aap soch nahin sakate
 Schools are deciding which brand to buy from which shop

 hamane kai email padhe hai
 If a leader is teaching them and starts the politics of arbitrary schooling then it can become quite popular
 in email ko padhate hue pataa chal rahaa he ki maa-baap chup nahin hai
 They are writing letters from District Magistrate to Chief Minister, Judges to Prime Minister
 karrwai nahin ho rahi he, wo alag baat he
 The orders are passed but do not apply but it is not that parents do not want to be free from this slavery of schools
 email ko padhakar laga ki maa-baap par vaaki aarthik dabaav he
 His salary in private jobs is now increasing at a low speed but the pace of increase in fees in schools is quite fast
 isliye kai maa baap samay par do bachche kii fees nahin de pate to let fees bharani padati he
 We have received many emails regarding late fees
 punjab ke navanshahar, rajasthan kii bundi, bihar ke kishanganj, dumriyaganj, gaya, sasaram, muzaffarpur se patr aae hai
 Many people have also emailed from Asansol, Kolkata, Bengal
 vishakhapattanam se bhi patr aa rahe hai
 Emails have come from Barhampur, Bargarh in Odisha
 rajasthan ke jhunjhanu se bhi patr aayaa he
 Email has come from almost every area of delhi
 upi ke renukut, nawabganj, pilibhit se patr aayaa he
 By reading these letters, it is felt that there is no difference in the fees of schools from Delhi to Jhunjhunu and from Berhampur to Bastar, while there is a difference in the earning in these places
 zaahir he maa baap par dabaav badhegaa hi
 Governments cannot ignore their problem
 bihar ke kishanganj se gautam ne likhaa he ki fees se tang aakar bachche ko privet skool se hataa hi liya
 In many places the parents have had to change the school but there is also a problem
 puure teen maheene kii fees jamaa karai gai he tab jaakar transfar certificate diye gaye hai
 It is all in people's emails
 ek patr aayaa he ki 2013 main coshan mani ke taur par 44000 rupee jamaa karaae the
 But when the decision was made to change the school due to increase in fees, only 6000 were returned
 38,000 rupee admician fee ke naam par skool ne kaat liye
 At the time of admission, it was said that the citation money would be fully refunded
 yah sahi he ki maa baap isaki shikaayat karte hai magar sunwaayee nahin hoti
 There are also demonstrations outside the schools, but no one listens, but there are stories of looting that cannot be called right in the name of a good private school
 kuch nahin ho saktaa to inhen suna hi jaae
 Students in 9th and 10th are emailing us, so i don't believe nothing will happen
 kuch nahin hoga to ye samaaj kii haar hogi, meri nahin
 We have sorted a few tales of loot even today by email
 banaras ke ek skool ne diary ke 800 rupee liye hai
 a school in Sasaram added the price of the book to the school's receipt even after purchasing the book online
 bhavnagar kaa ek skool 25000 cash letaa he magar dhai hazaar kii raseed detaa he
 a school in Damoh, Madhya Pradesh is offering a science book for Rs 595
 kolkata ke ek skool ne bag ke liye 2000 rupee liye hai
 a school of 80 rupees is being taken for 300 rupees
 jaipur kaa ek skool jarnal ke naam par sabhi chaatr se anivaary rup se 1000 rupee letaa he
 This journal contains rubbish in the name of inspiring stories
 ek parivaar kaa do baccha padhata he to ek hi jarnal ke liye 2000 dene padate hai
 a school is charging Rs 500 per student in the name of Saraswati Puja
 nagad fees lene kii khub shikaayat he
 In view of this, the Prime Minister must take a look
 unke ek aadesh se yah sambhav ho saktaa he ki skulon main kuch bhi lenden cash na ho, balki skulon main jinke bachche pard rahe hai wo pradhanmantri ke cashlesh abhiyaan kii har din pariksha lete hai
 Therefore, the government should also be extra active and sensitive about this
 kai baar acchhee niyat se liya gaya faisla ulta bhi pad jaataa he
 An email from Aurangabad in Maharashtra states that the city does not have a public transport system
 kamishnar ne tay kar diya ki aato main 4 or vine main 10 se adhik bachche nahin jaaenge
 Since there is no bus, now the van had to be given 1200 instead of 500 as the van was charging more
 aisa chakra he ki faisla aata bhi he to fansaa jaataa he
 Now ask yourself a question
 skool kyon tay karegaa ki aap kis brands kaa juuta pahanenge
 An email has come from UP
 usamen likhaa he ki footvier company ne kai skool khol liye hai
 His shoes are essentially sold in all schools and at a higher price
 anushaasan ke naam par mahange or videshi brands ke juute kyon pahanane chahie
 Does not discipline come from simplicity, does discipline come from expensive brands, black shoes have to be worn, so why should students not buy from their capacity? Who is going to school decides that you buy an expensive brand shoe in 2000
 kya skool main padhane vaale sabhi maa baap kii kshamta ek hi hoti he
 a school in Raipur forces them to buy expensive brand shoes
 skool ke bacchon ke liye koi chhot nahin hoti he
 The email states that they have been charged more than the rest of the cities
 tippaniyan Even the one who understands and the one who does not understand, understand one thing in simple Hindi
 ise ghulaami kehete hai
 You have been enslaved
 schoolo ne juuton kii bikri ke liye tarah tarah ke tikadam kiye hai jinhen ham bina dimag lagaae sweekaar kar rahe hai

 Link in bio Hi my name is Karenjit Weber and i am raising funds for my friend, Prabhakar
 He is the one who takes care of our whole team while i am shooting
 He is also the Mamaji (uncle) of Nisha, Asher and Noah
 He is the sole bread winner which makes it very difficult for his family to bear the expenses of his treatment
 He has a wife, a mother and his child who depend on him
 He has been fighting Kidney failure
 One year ago he was hospitalized in a horrible hospital that was not treating his condition properly and told him that he needed to remove his kidneys
 They would have killed him for his organs
 Daniel (my husband) and i had no idea until the last minute and removed him from that place immediately and cleared his bills for release
 We then admitted him in a proper hospital and he saw a kidney specialist who informed us that only 20% of his kidneys are functioning
 With proper eating and medication he has been able to make it through the year
 His entire family depends on him for their survival, making it nearly impossible for him to take the rest that he so badly requires for his medical condition
 He has recently been hospitalized because he has complete kidney failure and has to be on dialysis
 He was even recently pronounced dead on the table and somehow with the hand of God he was resuscitated and brought back to us
 He now needs a kidney transplant so he can recover properly to live and work in the field that makes him so happy

 com / lnowavm4qq aksar log kisi shubh kaary ko shuru karne se pehle sankalp karte hai or us sankalp ko kaary rup dete samay kehete hai ki hamane amuk kaary kaa shriganesh kiya
 Some people write Shree Ganeshayaya Namah at the beginning of the work
 yahaan tak ki patradi likhte samay bhi 'uun' yaa shriganesh kaa naam ankit karte hai
 Why consider Shree Ganesh to be the first worshiper? People believe that by memorizing the name of Ganesh, their work is done smoothly - hence the practice of reciting 'vinayako vighnaraja-daimatur Ganadhipa' in the worship of Vinayaka has gone on
 yahaan tak ki unke naam se ganesh uppurana bhi he
 Why is the glory of puran-purush Ganesha sung everywhere? This question is bound to arise
 is sambandh main ek kahani prachlit he
 Once in all the gods, the question arose which god should be worshiped first on earth
 sabhi dev apane ko mahaan bataane lage
 Finally, to solve this problem, Devarshi Narada advised Shiva to be Nirnaryak
 shiv ne soch-vichaarkar ek pratiyogita yojit kii- jo apane vaahan par savaar ho prithvi kii parikrama karke pratham lautenge, ve hi prithvi par pratham puja ke adhikari honge
 All the gods started riding on their vehicles
 ganesh jeene apane pita shiv or mata parvati kii saat baar parikrama kii or shant bhav se unke saamne haath jodakar khadey rahe
 Karthikeya mounted on his peacock vehicle, circled the earth and returned and said to Darp, 'I am victorious in this competition, therefore i am entitled to receive the first worship on earth
 'shiv apane charane ke paas bhakthi-bhav se khadey vinayak kii ore prasann mudra main dekh bole, 'putr ganesh tumse bhi pehle brahmad kii parikrama kar chukaa he, vahi pratham puja kaa adhikari hoga
 Karthike said in disgust, Dad, how is this possible? Ganesha can revolve around the universe for many years by sitting on his vicious vehicle
 aap kahin to parihaas nahin kar rahe hai?' 'nahin bete!ganesapane mata-pita kii parikrama karke yah pramanit kar chukaa he ki mata-pita brahmad se badhkar kuch or hai
 Ganesh has made the world aware of this
 'itane main baaki sab dev aa pahunche or sabane ek swar main sweekaar kar liya ki ganesh ji hi prithvi par pratham pujan ke adhikari hai
 Many stories related to Ganesh GK are also mentioned in the Puranas
 ek katha ke anusaar shiv ek baar sristi ke saundarya kaa avlokan karne himalayon main bhootganon ke saath vihaar karne chale gaye
 Parvati agreed to take bath
 sochaa ki koi bheetar na aa jaae, isliye unhone apane sharir ke lepan se ek pratimaa banaai or usamen pranapratishtha karke dwaar ke saamne pehre par bithaaya
 Ordered him to stop anyone from entering
 vah balak dwaar par paharaa dene laga
 Get Lakshmi Kripa with Ganesh worship
 
 
 itane main shiv ji aa pahunche
 He started going inside
 balak ne unako andar jane se roka
 In anger, Shiv ji cut off the head of the boy
 snaan se lautakar parvati ne is drishy ko dekha
 Shiva told all the accounts and said, 'what have you done? This is our son
 ' shiv ji dukhi hue
 Called the ghosts and ordered that if any creature sleeps with its head facing north, then cut its head and bring it
 bhootgan uskaa sir katkar le aae
 Shiv ji, by sticking the elephant's head on the child's torso, burnt his life in it
 tavase vah balak 'gajvadan' naam se lokapriy hua
 Second story
 
 
 duusari katha bhi ganesh ji ke janm ke bare main prachlit he
 Once there was a desire in Parvati's mind that she should have a son who would worship the first of all the gods
 inhone apni ichha shiv ji ko bataai
 On this Shiv ji advised him to celebrate Pushpak fast
 parvati ne puspak vrath kaa anushthan karne kaa sankalp kiya or us yajna main sammilit hone ke liye samast devi-devataaon ko nimantran diya
 The Yajna started on a fixed date
 yajtmandal sabhi devi-devataaon ke alok se jagamaga uthaa
 Shiva ji was engaged in paying obeisance to the incoming gods, but due to the absence of Lord Vishnu, his mind was anxious
 jaane koun sa he ganesh ji kaa sabase mangalakaari rup
 
 
 After a while, Lord Vishnu reached his vehicle Garuda
 sabane unki jayakaar karke sadar unka swaagat kiya
 He was placed in the proper posture
 brahmaji ke putr sanatkumar yajna kaa paurohitya kar rahe the
 The yajna started with the Veda mantras
 yatha samay yajna nirvighn samaapt hua
 Lord Vishnu blessed Parvati, 'parvati! Your wish will be fulfilled
 aapke sankalp ke anuroop ek putr kaa udai hoga
 Parvati was pleased with the blessings of Lord Vishnu
 usee samay sanatkumar bol uthe, 'main is yajna kaa ruthvik hum
 The Yajna has been successfully completed, but according to the shastra-vidhi, until the priest is satisfied with proper dakshina, the yagna will not receive the fruit of the yajna
 ' 'kahie purohit ji, aap kisi dakshina chaahate hai?' parvati ji ne poocha
 'bhagwati, i want to look at your husbands live as Dakshina
 'shiv-parvati ne rakhaa radha-krishna rup
 
 
 Parvati said painfully, 'purohit ji, you are asking for good fortune
 aap jaanate hi hai ki koi bhi nari apana sarvasv daan kar sakati he, parantu apana saubhaahgya kabhi nahin de sakati
 Please ask for something else
 ' parantu sanatkumar apane hath par ade rahe
 He clearly said that he will take Shiva in Dakshina only, Parvati ji will not get the result of yagya if she does not give Dakshina
 devataaon ne sanatkumar ko anek prakaar se samajhaayaa, par ve apni baat par date rahe
 On this, Lord Vishnu explained to Parvati ji, "parvati ji! If you do not give Dakshina to the priest, you will not get the fruit of the yagna and your wish will not be fulfilled
 ' parvati ne drudh swar main uttar diya, 'bhagwaan! main apane pati se vanchit hokar putr ko paanaa nahin chaahati
 i only want my husband
 'shiv ji ne mandahas karke kaha, 'parvati, tum mujhe dakshina main de do
 You will not be hurt
 ' parvati dakshina main apane pati ko dene ko taiyaar ho gai, tabhi antariksh se ek divya prakaash udit hokar prithvi par aa utraa
 From within, Shri Krishna appeared with his divine form
 us vishwa swaroop ke darshan karke sanatkumar ahradit ho bole, 'bhagwati! ab main dakshina nahin chahta
 i got my desired fruit
 ' shrikrishna ke jaynadon se sara yagyamandap pratidhwanit ho uthaa
 After this all the gods left from there
 thodi hi der baad ek wipro veshdhari ne aakar parvati ji se kaha, 'maa, main bhookha han, ann do
 'parvati ji brought the dessert and placed it in front of the visitor
 chand minuton main hi thaal samaapt kar dwij ne phir poocha, 'maa, meri bhukh nahin miti, thodaa or khaane ko do
 'that Brahmin kept asking for equal, Parvati ji kept bringing something or something, yet he was not satisfied
 kuch or maangata rahaa
 Parvati ji's tolerance kept going
 ye he bhagwaan shiv ko khush karne kaa khaas mantra
 
 
 She was irritated, went to Shiv ji and said in a complaining voice, 'dev, don't know what kind of a petitioner it is
 oh, kitna khilaayaa, or maangata he
 It says that his stomach is not full
 main or kahaan se laakar khilaa sakati hum
 Shiva ji was surprised at that petitioner
 us dekhne ke liye pahunche, par vahaan koi yaachak na tha
 Parvati said with amazement, "it was still here, i don't know how it became invisible" Shiva ji said in retaliation, "devi, he went nowhere
 vah yaheen he, tumhaare udar main
 He is not a stranger, only your son Ganesh
 tumhaare manokamana puri ho gai he
 You have received the result of Pushpak Yagya
 ' is prakaar bhagwaan shiv ke anugrah se ganesh janm dhaaran karke ganadhipati ban gaye

 rafel (rafale Deal) par jari ghamaasan ke bich bijepi ke rashtriya mahasachiv kailash vijayawargeey (kailash Vijayvargiya) ne congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi (rahul Gandhi) par hamalaa bolaa
 BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya alleged that Rahul, while speaking in Pakistan's greed for power, is demanding the disclosure of confidential details of the deal for these fighter jets
 vijayawargeey ne bhaajapa kii sabha main kaha, 'rafel saude ko lekar rahul centre sarkaar se ve prashn kyon puch rahe hai, jinka jawaab pakistan jaananaa chahta he
 Why are you (rahul) seen standing with our enemy country? Why are you (rahul) speaking the language of Pakistan in the love of the chair? ”BJP General Secretary was addressing the gathering during the bjp's dharna against the Congress in the Rafael case
 unhone yah aarope bhi lagaaya ki congress netaaon ne satta ke laalach main pehle bhi pakistan ke sur main sur milaate hue sargical strike ke saboot maange the or bhartiya sainikon kii veerta kaa apmaan kiya tha
 Vijayvargiya said, 'the decision of the top court in the Rafale case has come in favor of the Narendra Modi government
 main samajhataa hum ki is faisle ke baad rahul ko chullu bhar pani main duubakar mar janaa chaiye
 But now he is saying that a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) should be formed to investigate the Rafale deal
 'bhaajapa mahasachiv ne kaha, 'agar rahul main dam he, to vah rafel maamle main loksabhaa main bahes karen
 But the Congress is not allowing the proceedings of the Lok Sabha to continue on this issue
 ' unhone tanj kiya, 'rahul khud ek kanfujd netaa hai or vah desh kii janata ko bhi kanfujd karnaa chaahate hai
 The BJP general secretary alleged that the previous Congress-led UPA government did not buy Rafale aircraft from 2007 to 2014 because it was looking for brokers for the deal
 iske alaava vijayawargeey ne kaha, 'jab congress (chunaav) jitati he or congress kaa (vijay) juluus nikalataa he, to log is juluus main pakistan jindabad ke naare lagaate hai, lekin congress ke kaaryakarta is par kuch nahin kehete
 He said, 'we have seen many electoral defeats and victories
 lekin ham bhaajapa ke kaaryakarta hai
 If someone in the BJP procession shouts slogans of Pakistan Zindabad, then we dig a pit there and bury it in the ground
 'vijayawargeey ne kaha, 'ham vot bank kii raajnneeti ke liye is baat ko kabhi bardaasht nahin karenge ki koi vyakti 'bharat tere tukade honge' jaise naare lagaaye or congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi aise logon se milane chale jaayen
 If the BJP workers simply walk, then they pull the slogan of those who raise such slogans and give it in their hands

 What happened in the Tripura Assembly elections was reduced, political pundits and politicians are extracting all sorts of matters
 sipiem daawa kar rahi he ki party phir satta main aegi
 At the same time, BJP is thrashing that the party will taste the power of Tripura for the first time
 jaahir he ki chunaav parinaam se pehle sari partiyaan jeet kaa daawa karti hai
 78 in Tripura assembly elections held on Sunday
 56 fisadi matdaan hua he, jo pichley vidhansabha chunaav ke 91
 About 13 percent has come down from 82 percent voting
 rajya kii vidhansabha kii kul 60 siton main se 59 par shantipurna matdaan hua
 This time the political meanings of low voting have started to be explored
 mana ja rahaa he ki is baar ke nattejey kuch apratyaashit ho sakate hai
 The mood of the hill state of Tripura has changed
 is baar ke chunaav main tripura main do dalon ke bich spardhaa he or sipiem dhai dashak se satta main hai, jabaki bijepi teji se purvottar main sakriyata ke saath apni paith bana rahi he
 BJP had come up with the issue of development
 rajya kisatta par 25 saal se asin vammorchake liye is baar chunavi jang aasaan nahin he
 In order to spread its foot in the Northeast, BJP had given full strength in the Tripura assembly elections
 itnaa hi nahin chunaav ayog kii ore se bhi sakht ravaiya apnaane ke chalate mana ja rahaa he ki is baar voting kam hui he
 People who keep a close watch on the politics of Tripura also feel that low voting may surprise the election results this time
 ye jaruri nahin he ki matdaan kam hone se rajya main sattashin party kii haar hoti he or matdaan zyada hone se vipaksh kii jeet hoti he
 You can win even when the voting is low and you can win even if the voting is high
 yahi maapdand haar ke liye bhi lagu ho saktaa he
 One thing is clear, however, that a 13 per cent decrease in polling may lead to a big upsurge in political politics
 pichley do dashakon se tripura kii kaman sanbhale huemukhyamantri maanik sarkaar ko pehali baar bijepise kadi chunauti kaa saamana karnaa padaa he
 Although Chief Minister Manik Sarkar is known for his clean and honest image, the way the BJP and Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh campaigned at the grassroots level for some time, it could be a loss for the CPM
 tripura main matdaan kam hone kii kai vajahen ho sakati he
 Currently, the first reason for the low turnout is the lack of enthusiasm among the voters compared to the previous assembly elections
 duusari vajah ye bhi maani ja rahi he ki chunaav ayog ke sakht ravaie se voting kam hui he
 The CPM cadre has been accusing the BJP of indulging in false vote by booth hooliganism
 aise main agar bijepi ke aarope sahi maane to voting kam hona sipiem ke liye musiibat kaa sabab ban saktaa he
 The BJP, on the other hand, came into the fray with populist promises
 bijepi ne tripura main yuvaaon ke liye muft smartphone, mahilaon ke liye muft main grajuation tak kii shiksha, rojgaar, karmchaariyon ke liye saatven vetan ayog kii siforeeshon ko lagu karne jaise vaade kiye hai
 These are aspects which affect the results to a great extent
 maanik sarkaar ko pichley chunaav main kareeb pachaas fisadi vot mila ho or uske prati janata main asantosh kii koi aisi lahar bhi na ho to phir usko satta se baahar karnaa aasaan nahin hoga
 The state government has also done many things and has its own promises
 purvottar ke rajyon main tripura apekshaakrit shant pradesh rahaa he, lekin pichley dinon yahaan jo dushkarm or hatya kii ghatnaon se kanoon-vyavastha ko lekar logon main asantosh he, jisase ve vyavastha parivartan ke liye vot daal sakate hai
 But the way voting has decreased
 wo maanik sarkaar ke liye santosh kii baat rahi he
 Political equation 48 to the ruling CPM in the 2013 assembly election
 11 fisadi maton ke saath 49 siton par jeet mili thi, jabaki mukhya vipakshi dal congress 36
 It was second with 10 percent winning 53 seats
 ek seat sipiai ke khate main gai thi
 1 to BJP and its strong ally Indigenous People's Front of Tripura (IPFT) in this election
 57 fisadi or 0
 46 percent votes were received and both could not get a single seat

 shivasena ne apane mukhpatr saamana main bihar chunaav ke nateezon ko maharashtra ke liye sandesh bataaya he
 It is said that its clear message is that next time elections are held in Maharashtra, Shiv Sena will emerge as the leader, because Shiv Sena is the future
 ab is haar kii jimmedaari koun legaa
 BJP now needs introspection
 bijepi ne saare sansaadhan laga die, phir bhi harsamna ne likhaa he ki bijepi ne pradhanmantri narendra modi ke netritv main bihar chunaav ladaa
 But these results are not unexpected
 bijepi ne apane saare sansaadhan laga die bihar main, jabaki nitish ne apane maujuuda sansadhano ko hi istemaal kiya
 Bihar is the legacy of Jayaprakash Narayan
 modi ne 30 reliyaan kii, phir bhi haar mili

 Samana has written that Bihar had the same situation as Maharashtra

 He cautioned the Congress that there is a lot of anger against the BJP in Gujarat, but the Congress's extremely poor campaign is proving weak in challenging the BJP
 isliye aam aadmi party ne puure rajya main janata ko aagaah karne ke liye un siton par bhi prachaar abhiyaan shuru kar diya he jahaan party chunaav nahin lard rahi he
 In an informal conversation with the AAP media, Rai said that the party is making separate manifestos for each seat
