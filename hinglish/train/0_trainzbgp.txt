 congress netaa sanjay raut ne kaha he ki saavarkar ke yogadan ko kabhi bhulaayaa nahin ja saktaa he
 He said that the Shiv Sena respects Gandhi, Nehru, Subhash Chandra Bose, in the same way that the Shiv Sena should also respect Veer Savarkar, adding that there will be no compromise with Savarkar's honor

 Despite the repeated cleanliness of Nestlé, the manner in which the ban has been imposed in many states has increased the scope of the controversy over the quality of Maggi
 ab nestle ke saamne chunauti upabhoktaaon kaa vishwaas hasil karne kii hogi
 Following an investigation by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI), an organization of the Ministry of Health, the Health Ministry ordered an immediate halt to the production and sale of Maggi
 yahi nahin sarkaar kaa aarope he ki megi ne bina ijazat kai vairiyents nikaale
 Also, FSSAI also said that Maggi Oats Masala Noodles were launched in the market without approval and it has also been asked to remove them from the market
 FSSAI kaa kahana he ki nestle ne MSG ko lekar maanakon kii andekhi kii he or company ko teen din main is aadesh par amal kii report dene ko kaha he
 On the other hand, on Friday, Paul Bulke, the global CEO of Nestlé, the biggest executive of Nestle-making company, came out and claimed that there is nothing wrong in Maggi - he is completely safe from health
 company ne kaha ki usne megi ke 1000 se zyaada namoonon kii jaanch kii gai or har jaanch par megi khari utari
 But there is confusion about Maggi, so we are removing it from the market
 company ne daawa kiya ki megi jald bazaar main waapas lautegi
 Also, the Global CEO of Nestlé also stated that the quality standards are uniform throughout the world
 bulke ne kaha ki upabhoktaaon kii suraksha unki praathamikta he or unke liye stock market se zyaada logon kaa bharosa or sehat ahm he
 Nestle also said that Maggie hopes to return to the market soon
 tippaniyan When NDTV asked Nestle Global CEO Paul Bullke about MSG being found in Maggi, he said that we do not mix MSG on our behalf
 udhar shuukravaar ko bihar main megi par ek maheene kii pabandi lagaai gai he
 Maggi has also been stopped in Madhya Pradesh
 nestle kii baar-baar safai ke baavjood jis tarah se kai rajyon main pratibandh lagaaya gaya he usase megi kii gunvattta ko lekar uthe vivaad kaa dayera or bad gaya he
 Now the challenge for Nestle will be to gain the trust of consumers
 saath hi FSSAI ne ye bhi kaha ki megi oats masala noodles ko bina manjuuri ke bazaar main utaara gaya or ise bhi bazaar se hataane ko kaha gaya he
 FSSAI states that Nestle has ignored the standards regarding MSG and has asked the company to report on the order in three days
 udhar shuukravaar ko megi banane vaali company nestle ke sabase bade adhikari, nestle ke global siio paul bulke ne saamne aakar daawa kiya ki megi main koi gadabadi nahin he- wo sehat ke lihaaj se puri tarah surakshit he
 The company said that it tested more than 1000 specimens of Maggi and on every test Maggi stood up
 lekin megi ko lekar bhram failaa he isliye ham ise bazaar se hataa rahe hai
 The company claimed that Maggie would soon return to the market
 saath hi, nestle ke global siio ne ye bhi kaha ki gunvattta ke maapdand puri duniya main ek samaan hai
 Bulke said that the safety of consumers is his priority and that for them the trust and health of more people than the stock market is important
 nestle ne ye bhi kaha ki ummid he megi jald bazaar main vaapasi karegi
 The comments enditivi ne jab nestle ke global siio paul bulke se megi main MSG paye jane par sawaal poocha to unhone kaha ki ham MSG apni taraf se nahin milaate

 In the meantime, a high official of the government has advocated steps to curb the increase in prices through mutual connivance with the traders

 unki jagah murali vijay ko team main chunaa gaya he
 Rohit's injury is the biggest concern for India before landing in the third match

 The first ODI in Bristol was canceled without a single ball bowled, while the second match in Cardiff was won by India over Duckworth Lewis to take a 1-0 lead in the series

 It remains to be seen how the Indian bowlers perform on the unfavorable pitch of Trentbridge

 sai baba kii puja ko lekar ghamaasan badhata ja rahaa he
 Angered by the statement of Union Minister Uma Bharti, Shankaracharya Swami Swaroopanand has called a big meeting of saints and saints in his Haridwar ashram today
 baithak main sai baba kii puja ko lekar vichaar-manthan hoga
 It is being told that in this meeting a motion of condemnation can be passed against Water Resources Minister Uma Bharti, who gave a statement in support of Sai Baba's worship
 is baithak main ganga ke mudde par bhi charchaa hogi
 Earlier on Saturday, Shankaracharya Swami Swaroopanand lashed out at Union Minister Uma Bharti for saying the worship of Sai Baba accurately
 shankaracharya ne kaha ki uma bharti sai kii puja kaa samarthan kar dabaab kii raajnneeti kar rahi hai
 Swami Swaroopananda has said that Uma Bharati Ram is not a devotee
 vah sai kii puja karti hai
 Uma has spoiled the nature of her devotion
 unase ram bhagwaan naaraaz hai
 Sai Bhakti is the reason for Uma Bharti's failure
 unhone kaha ki uma mantri hai, bhagwaan nahin
 They have been chosen by the people to govern and they should not interfere in religious systems
 isse pehle uma bharti ne haridwar main sai puja kaa samarthan karte hue kaha tha ki wo khud sai bhakt hai or yadi unke bhakt sai ko bhagwaan maanate hai to kya galat he
 At the same time, Uma Bharti has said that she believes in saintly tradition and is not in favor of taking this dispute forward
 ab kendriya jal sansaadhan mantri ke is bayaan par shankaracharya bifer gaye hai
 He raised Uma Bharti's Guru Bhakti in the circle of questions and said that Guru Swami Vishwesh Teertha initiation to renounce, he is opposing Sai Puja
 unhone hamaari baat kaa sarmathan kiya he
 In Sanatan tradition, a monk is a devotee, then Uma is such a ascetic who is going against her guru
 shankaracharya ne kaha ki hindu dharm main sanathan dharm main acharya dharmik vyavasthaaon ko dekhte hai or uma bataaen ki koun sa acharya kah rahaa he ki sai kii puja karnaa uchit he
 Let us tell you that this dispute started when Shankaracharya Swami Swaroopanand Saraswati of Dwarka Peeth had said that Hindus should not worship Sai

 In rjd's reconstituted national executive, party supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav nominated his wife Rabri Devi as the executive vice-president
 lalu ne saath hi apane donon bete tej pratap yadav or tejasvi yadav samet beti misa yadav ko rashtriya kaaryakarini main sadsy ke rup main barkaraar rakhaa
 Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi has taken a dig at Lalu Yadav's move and said that it is now clear that RJD is a family undertaking
 susheel modi ne kaha ki jis tareeke se lalu ne apni patni, beti or donon beton ko rashtriya kaaryakarini main danke kii chot par shaamil kiya he, isse yah baat saaf ho gai he ki rashtriya janata dal main rashtriya or janata jaise shabdon se logon ko bhram nahin hona chahie
 Modi said that the manner in which Lalu made Rabri Devi number two in the party, bypassing all senior party leaders in 1997, the same thing has been repeated once again in 2018
 modi ne kaha ki argedy 'for da family, bai da family and of da family' party he jisase loktantr kii ummid karnaa beyimaani he
 On the other hand, regarding RJD vice-president Shivanand Tiwari stating the education system of Bihar, Modi said that leaders like Shivanand Tiwari are now trying to convince the people of Bihar that the shepherd schools opened during the 15 years of RJD rule
 This was a good concept and the 15 years of lalu-rabri's reign was a golden period of education

 com / 7hd5qq16ua yogi adityanath sarkaar uttar pradesh main madrason ke baad ab privet skulon kii nakel kasne ja rahi he
 Parents often complain about arbitrarily increasing fees in private schools
 isi kaa tod nikaalte hue yogi sarkaar ne sabhi privet skulon ke liye apane fees strecchar ko website par daalana anivaary kar diya he or aisa karne ke liye unhen 31 disambar tak kaa samay diya gaya he
 The government is going to issue orders in this regard soon
 ye aadesh un tamamprivet or public schoolonpar lagu hoga, jo salanaa 20 hajaar se zyada fees vasuulate hai
 However, the government has decided to keep schools run by minority organizations and Christian missionaries separate from this order
 bataa den ki mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ne mangalvaar shaam ko madhyamik shiksha vibhaag kaa ek pregentation dekha
 In this, suggestions were made to stop the arbitrary and other fees of private schools
 pregentation ke baad yah bhi tay kiya gaya he ki logon se bhi is sambandh main suzav mangaaye jaaen, taaki vidheyak laane se pehle logon kii raay bhi jaani ja sake
 It is being told that Yogi Adityanath himself has given several suggestions to check private schools after seeing the presentation
 in sujhaavon ko maanate hue shiksha vibhaag aagaamee sheetakaaleen satr main privet skool bill vidheyak laane ja rahaa he
 The government is trying to set rules regarding fees for all private schools before the next academic session
 is pregentation main aae sujhaavon ko agar lagu kar diya jaataa he to privet skool har saal 5 fisadi se zyada fees nahin badha paaenge
 Along with this, they will also have to increase the salary allowance of their teachers and staff in proportion to the increase in fees
 pregentation khatm hone ke baad upi ke dipti siem or shiksha mantri dinesh sharma ne kaha kiprivet skulon kii manamaniab nahin chalegi
 The manner in which they harass parents and students will now be banned
 mukhyamantri ji ke saath aaj baithak hui he
 The entire presentation is shown to him
 saamne aae sabhi suzav shiksha vibhaag kii website par aplod karaane ke baad abhibhavakon se suzav maange jaaenge
 Then steps will be taken in this direction
 is puri kavayad kaa makasad skulon kii manamaani ko rokna he jisase ki abhibhavakon or vidhyaarthiyon par zyada dabaav naa pade
 Also, everyone should get quality education
 holi main ab bas kuch hi din rah gaye hai
 The boss has not yet approved the holiday so you have not even been able to get a railway ticket
 aise main aakhri samay main tikat lenaa padaa to itani bheed main conform tikat milanaa mushkil he
 Obviously, you have to rely on the Tatkal ticket
 lekin tatkaal tikat kataane ke liye bhi kam maaramaari nahin he
 But do not panic
 IRCTC kii website se tikat kataane waalon ke liye ham laae hai saat achook tips jo aapako conform tatkaal tikat dilwane main madad karenge
 1
 apane computer yaa laptop par edblokar install karen:sabase pehle apane computer yaa laptop par edblokar install karen
 Now you will think what it means to cut the ticket, then we tell you
 aapane dhyaan diya hoga ki jab bhi aap Chrome yaa Mozilla ke jariye koi bhi website kholte hai to use kai tarah ke aid apane aap aane lagate hai
 Something similar www
 irctc
 co
 in par bhi hota he
 Such adds can cause trouble for you during the instant ticket reductions as it wastes your time
 to isse acha he ki aise aids ko block kar diya jaae taaki tikat kataane ke dauraan iske pop ap aapako pareshaan naa karen
 2
 do ID kaa istemaal karen:hameshaa do ID kaa istemaal karen
 If you have only one account on IRCTC then ask your friends or relatives for the password of another account
 phir donon ID ko log in kar len lekin dhyaan rahe ki donon ID alag alag broujar par khule hon nahin to aapaki donon ID apane aap log out ho jaaegi or sara khel bighad saktaa he
 3
 pataa karen, tatkaal khul kab rahaa he:vaise to kisi bhi train main tatkaal kota 24 ghante pehle khulata he
 But let us tell you that if a train opens from its destination and reaches your station on the second day, then the immediate quota of such trains is opened 24 hours before the opening of that train
 aise main aapke paas 48 ghante kaa samay hota he
 So before taking an instant ticket, first try to find such trains in which Tatkal quota opens 48 hours before
 is formule kaa istemaal kar ke aap phaayde main rah sakate hai
 4
 paisanger information pehle bhar len:jaisaa ki ham jaanate hai ki tatkaal kota subah 10 baje khulata he
 You should try to fill the passenger information list first
 kyonki agar ye kaam aap 10 baje shuru karenge to aapkaa samay barbaad hoga or yahaan to seconds main tatkaal kota phul ho jaataa he
 There are also two ways to fill the passenger information list
 pehla tarika:aap paisanger list main jaakar ek baar sari information ko 10 baje se pehle bhar len taaki jab aap tikat kataane jaaen to saare ditels drop down main apane aap riflact karne lage
 You just have to select it
 isse aapkaa samay bachegaa
 Second way: This is the master list
 IRCTC main ye ek aisi suvidha he jahaan jaakar aap pehle hi saare information bhar sakate hai
 You just have to select it later
 aisa karke aap apane kai minute bachaa sakate hai
 5
 saare document pehle se taiyaar rakhen:tikat kataane se pehle apana saare document taiyaar rakhen
 For example, ID number, Debit / Credit Card number or netbanking number
 koshish karen ki ye saare numbers aapako yaad hon taaki vakt barbaad naa ho
 6
 pehle 2nd AC tri karen:agar aap AC kaa tikat kataa rahe hai to pehle 2nd AC tri karen
 Because 3AC fills more quickly than 2AC on most routes
 aise main aapke liye 2AC main tikat milane kii sambhaavna bad jaati he
 Do not make any effort to cut the ticket in those trains which are less likely to get tickets
 7
 Always use netbanking for payment: You may find it a bit strange to hear this, but it is true that payment is much faster in netbanking than in Debit / Credit Card
 kyonki Debit / Credit card main aapako card number or baaki detail bharna padataa he
 But netbanking does not have to do anything like this
 pement hameshaa HDFC / ICICI kaa pement getwe istemaal karen
 It processes faster than the rest of the gateway
 to ye hai kuch tips jo aapako conform tatkaal tikat dilaane main madad kar sakate hai
 With the help of these tips, you will be present at your home in Holi this year with your family and friends
 baaki happy holi to he hi

 i was in Jakarta when i got 12 at night
 30 baje unka phone aayaa

 rashtriya swayamsevak sanghane apane kaaryakartaaon ke dress code main 64 saal baad kuch badlaav karte hue chamade kii jagah kritrim belt ko apnaane kaa faisla kiya he lekin khaaki nikkar ko pant main badalane ke prastaav ko asweekaar kar diya
 Union All India Publicity Chief Dr
 manmohan vaidyane bataaya, ‘yah badlaav is saal may-june main sangh shiksha varg ke aayojan se lagu hoga
 Instead of leather, its buckle will now be of steel instead of copper with artificial belt
 ’yah puche jane par ki sangh ne belt ke alaava unifarm main kya koi anya badlaav bhi kiya he, masalan half pant kii bajaay kya phul pant pahanane kii anumati hogi, jisaki kaaphi samay se kuch kaaryakarta maang kar rahe hai, vaidya ne kaha, ‘belt ke alaava koi anya parivartan nahin kiya gaya he
 "he said that till now the leather belts used by the Sangh people were taken especially from the tanneries in Kanpur where the skins of slaughtered animals are not used
" unhone kaha, ‘sangh ne hameshaa yah shart rakhi ki use aapurti kii jane vaali belt vadh kiye gaye jaanwaron kii khaal se nahin bani honi chahie
 Asked the reason for the change of the belt of synthetic material instead of leather, he said that some members, especially the Jain community, had objections to the leather belt
 ve ise pahanane main asahaj mahasoos karte the, bhale hi ye belt vadh kiye gaye jaanwaron kii khaal se nahin bani hotin
 Such members were often urged from the Sangh forums to replace the leather belt with a synthetic material belt
 vaidya ne kaha ki chamade kii jagah ab kritrim vilalp aasaani se uplabdh hone ke kaaran hamane is badlaav kaa nirnay kiya he
 With this, those who were reluctant to wear leather belts will now feel comfortable and the Sangh's dependence on particular tanneries will be eliminated
 sangh ke dress code main sabase pehla parivartan 1940 main kiya gaya tha
 Vaidya said that in the British era, both half pants and kameez were khaki colors and RSS inscribed copper badge was on the shirt
 1940 isamen parivartan karke kameez ko khaaki kii bajaay safed kar diya gaya
 He said, "white shirt with khaki half pants looks more elegant than khaki half pants and khaki shirt
 ’prachaar pramukh ne bataaya ki doosraa parivartan 1947 main kiya gaya
 Till then, Sangh workers wore long boots with heels in the branches
 tab long boot kii bajaay saamaanya kaale juute kar die gaye or ab 64 varsh baad yah teesraa parivartan hua he
 He said, 'the Sangh has always been in favor of change
 jab bhi parivartan kii aavashyaktaa hoti he sangh apane ko parivartit karata he

 co / cxertqw1wi— Arvind Kejriwal (@arvindkejriwal)june 25, 2016 The conflict between the two countries has increased due to the Kartarpur corridor, which is important for the religious faith of the Sikh community living in India and Pakistan
 pakistan ne kartarpur coridor kholane ke samjhaute ko antim rup dene ke prastaav par bharat ke jawaab ko bachakaana bataaya he or kaha ki islamabad kaa jawaab paripakv hoga
 Pakistan, while sharing the draft agreement with India, sent an invitation to the Indian delegation to come to finalize it
 lekin bharat ne kaha ki pakistani pratinidhimandal ko yahaan aana chahie
 Pakistan Foreign Department spokesman Muhammad Faisal said that Islamabad had sent an invitation to the Indian delegation, sharing the detailed proposal related to the agreement, to finalize its modalities
 lekin pakistan kii pehle par sakaaratmak jawaab dene ke bajaay bharat ne pakistani pratinidhimandal ko nai dilli aane ko kaha or is baithak ke liye do sambhavit tareekhen- 26 farvari or 7 march sujhai gayi
 Faisal said in a conversation with the Pakistani media, "as far as India's response is concerned, it has behaved in a childish manner
" hamane pehle bhi, sitambar 2018 main pradhanmantri imran khan ke patr par bharat kii ore se isi tarah kaa jawaab praapt kiya
 In contrast to India's position, Pakistan will respond very maturely and thoughtfully to this very important issue and will respond very soon to India's initiative
 'gauratlab he ki bahupratikshit kartarpur galiyara pakistan ke kartarpur sthit darbar sahib ko bharat ke gurudaspur jile ke deraa baba nanak se jodega

 is galiyare ke khulne ke sikh shraddhaluon ko is aitihaasik dharmasthal ke darshan karne kaa mauka milegaa jahaan gurunanak dev ne apane antim 18 saal gujaarey
 Meanwhile, Faisal alleged that 2300 cases of ceasefire violations were reported by India last year and these cases are increasing further
 unhone kaha ki pakistan bharat kii taraf se bina uksaave ke kii jane vaali firing kaa makul jawaab de rahaa he
 Faisal said that if he (india) speaks the language of peace, we will respond in a peaceful manner and if he speaks the language of the bullet, we will respond with the bullet

 Let me tell you that in a note issued by India on January 19, it was said that the fishermen's boat was shot and sunk by Pakistan Maritime Security Agency (PMSA)
 bharat ne is ghatana ko nindaneey or avyaavhaarik bataate hue kadi aapatti darj karai thi
 While the Bharti Coast Guard rescued 6 fishermen in this boat named Sudama Puri, there was no trace of 1
 faisal ne bharat ke aaropon kaa khandan karte hue kaha ki jis kshetra main yah ghatana hone kii baat kahi ja rahi he vahaan piemesa oparate hi nahin karata
 He alleged that Indian fishermen often catch fish illegally in Pakistan's Exclusive Economic Zone
 faisal ne kaha ki piemesa antarashtriya niyamon ke tahat in ilaakon main anti-poching oparation chalaata he
 a new politics has started in the state regarding Uttarakhand Congress state president Kishore Upadhyay and Aryendra Sharma
 kahin congress ke samarthak kishor upaadhyaay ko dehradun ke sahaspur se tikat dene kaa virodh kar rahe hai, to kahin tehri ke congress kaaryakarta unhen apane yanha bula rahe hai
 Congressmen from both the places have started demonstrations in the capital's office
 sahaspur se apane aapako ummidavaar ghoshit karne ko lekar aryendra sharma gut kaa hangaamaa itnaa jabardast he kii pichley teen din se uttarakhand ke congress pradesh karyaalay par aryendra samarthak kabza kiye baithe hai
 The situation is so uncontrollable that only the signs of commotion and sabotage remain on each side
 aryendra samarthak ek kaaryakarta ne aatmadah kii bhi koshish kii
 Aryendra is also very angry about why Kishore Upadhyay wants to contest from Sahaspur after leaving his Tehri assembly seat
 kishor upaadhyaay kaa sahaspur conekshancongress pradesh adhyaksh kishor upaadhyaay purv main tehri se vidhayak chune gaye the
 But since the Kishore Independent candidate Dinesh Dhane was defeated in the 2012 Legislative Assembly elections, since then, Dinesh Dhane and Kishore have a figure of 36 and in such a situation Harish Rawat not only supported Dinesh completely but also gave Dinesh on his feet
 Giving up the rank, Kishore left no stone unturned
 vishwasaneey sutara kii maane to ye harish kii raajnneeti kaa hi ek nayaa pintara he ki kishor ko sahaspur se tikat thama diya gaya
 The teenagers, who have grown up with this bet by Harish Rawat, have become so disputed that today the Congressmen are raising slogans of their Murdabad
 harish ravat kii sochi samajhi ranneeti kaam aayi or jab congress kii list jari hui to kishor ko aisi seat se tikat de diya gaya jahaan vidroh kii aag khud congressi hi laga rahe hai
 As soon as this announcement was made, the supporters of Aryendra Sharma, who have been preparing for this seat for more than six years, started to protest, Sharma's supporters have now set out at the Congress headquarters to send Kishore back from Sahaspur
 
 harish ravat ne apano par hi chalaa daanv!pradesh congress main philhal harish ravat se zyada tikadambaj koi nahin he
 By now Harish Rawat not only marginalized anyone who stood in front of him, but also set aside his political future
 pichley kai dinon se chali aa rahi harish ravat or kishor upaadhyaay kii jang puure pradesh ne dekhi, kishor har baar apane bayanon se harish ravat par hamalaa karte rahe or ravat har samay unke bayanon ko hansi main udaate rahe
 Harish Rawat was probably waiting for the time
 He knew that Kishore would definitely be trapped in his clutches
 kyonki harish ravat jaanate the kii jald wo samay aayega jab pradesh kii satta par harish ravat ke baad baithne kaa sapana dekh rahe kishor ko wo apni takat or ranneeti kaa daanv dikhaa paaenge
 After all Harish Rawat did the same, he has made Kishore Upadhyay so helpless that even Kishore himself is unable to understand
 aakhir kyon he harish or kishor main talkhikishor or harish ravat ke bich talkhi ko donon hi netaaon ne jag jaahir bhi kiya he
 Upadhyay not only questioned Rawat's work after becoming chief minister, but Kishore wrote a lot of letters to the government, moving away from the party line
 kishor upaadhyaay is baat ko lekar sarkaar ke khilaaf the ki harish ravat kii jo kichan kebinet he uske mantri thik se kaam hi nahin kar rahe hai
 Upadhyay has always raised questions about this
 alam ye rahaa ki kishor upaadhyaay ne pichley dinon parivaarwaad or tikat bantwaare ko lekar bhi aisa bayaan diya jo sidhe harish ravat ke seene par ja laga
 Kishore said that he would demand from the party that only one person from a family get a ticket
 ye baat jag jaahir he ki ravat apane bete or beti anupama ke liye tikat kii maang kar rahe the or janata ke bich ja kar unke liye prachaar karnaa tak shuru kar chuke hai
 Kishore's statement made Harish Rawat so angry that Rawat even said in his statement that everyone wants his son-daughter to take over his legacy and such statements have no place in the party
 haalanki party ne unke parivaar main se kisi ko tikat nahin diya

 ) Supreme Court Judge Justice Chelameswar once again gave an interview giving rise to controversy
 jajon ke aacharan ke liye jo niyam tay hai unamem intervyuu na dena bhi ek hidaayat he
 But Justice Chelameswar, in an interview to Karan Thapar, in response to a question, said that the rule is about the interview on decisions
 anya masalon par intervyuu diya ja saktaa he
 This move by Justice Chelameswar constitutes a major concern
 sabase pehle chintaa kii baat
 The Justice has openly transgressed the limits which the Supreme Court itself has set for judicial discipline
 har faisla jajon kii raay hota he lekin nijee nahin
 He is the voice of the judiciary of India and if the judge develops his personal concept in it, he may be as good as he is, but he sets an example
 jajon kii antaratma kii aawaaj adaalaton kaa anushaasan nahin tod sakati
 If the judiciary complies with the constitution and the discipline of law from others, if they dissolve it themselves, only the leaders will take advantage of it
 sochie jaj sahab agar aisi hi aawaaj sena yaa surakshabalon se uthne lagi to kya hoga
 Anarchy will come in the name of democracy in the country and under the guise of democracy
 netaa or raajnneetik dal har system ko todakar usamen apni taang adaane kii taak main rahete hai
 The biggest example of this is the police, whose credibility and functioning has gone below zero
 aazaadee ke baad ham apana system bana sakate the lekin police netaaon ke swaarth puure karne kaa sabase aasaan madhyam ban gai
 Police stations are sold
 
 
 jaisi baaten bahut aam or sweekrut ho gai hai
 The judiciary became the next target after the police
 haalanki agar nyaaypalika ne apane aap ko raajnneeti se bachaane kaa prayaas kiya hota to aaj ye din nahin dekhne ko miltaa
 Corruption starts from above
 netaa satta ke sheersh par hote hai lihaaja unki jimmedaari zyada banati thi jo ki unhone nahin nibhaai or nateeja puure tantra ke bhrasht hone ke rup main saamne aayaa
 Justice Chelameswar had exposed the apprehension within the judiciary only when he had a press conference last time
 lekin thik usee din unki vamadal ke ek netaa di
 Met the king at his home which lowered the level of impartiality of his own voice
 yahi 7 april ko karan thapar ko die saakshaatkaar main bhi hua jab unhone khaas cese khaas bench ko alaat kiye jane ke sawaal par sidhe kuch nahin bolaa lekin jab unhen jayalalita ke aay se adhik sampatti vaale cese kii yaad dilaai gai to unki taraf se sur sahmati kaa niklaa
 Justice Chelameswar was one of the opinionists against the repeal of the NJAC Act
 kaamkaaj ke aavanton ko lekar senior-junior ke sawaal agar loktantr ke duusare angon main bhi uthne lagenge to desh main araajaktaa aa jaaegi
 Even if other judges start walking on the path of Justice Chelameswar, what can be the condition of democracy in the country
 ab ummid kii charchaa
 Justice Chelameswar's move has alerted the judiciary and has put some pressure on him
 ummid ye he ki justise chelmeshwar kii tarah koi or aisa kadam na uthaae iske paryaapt intjaam kiye jaaenge
 The scope of judicial discipline will be broadened so that the judge can express his disagreement
 justise chelmeshwar ke ritairement ko bamushkil teen maheene bache hai or unhone is intervyuu main ye bhi elaan kar diya ki main ritairement ke baad kisi bhi sarkaar kaa koi bhi pad nahin grahan karuunga
 This is the most positive thing he has said
 isi li par agar duusare jaj or hoicourt ke jaj bhi chalenge to nishchit taur par nyaaypalika kii vishwasaneeyata badhegi
 But it is difficult to save the constitution and democracy of this country without strictly following the discipline
 rajaneta chahen to police ko nirmal banane se shuruyaat kar sakate hai lekin unase ummid nahin he
 The hope is only from the court which keeps both of them fit
 jammu-kashmir ke shopiyaan main ravivaar tadake suraksha balon ne encounter main do aatankiyon ko maar giraaya

 But when the scientists who make the country's top in science do so, then the question arises whether it is superstition or faith
 vahiin, bharat ratna se sammanit vaigyanik sienaar raav kehete hai ki unhen isro ke puja kii parampara thik nahin lagati
 But this is the decision of ISRO scientists
 bhartiya antariksh anusandhan sanghathan (ISRO) 15 july ko Chandrayaan-2 launch karne vaala he
 ISRO scientists go to Tirupati Balaji temple before every launch and perform rocket worship
 vahaan rocket kaa chota model chadhaate hai, taaki unhen unke mishan main safalataa mili
 Not only the Indian Space Agency, the US space agency NASA, scientists from all over the world, including Russian scientists, believe in superstition
 totake karte hai
 Come
 
 
 jaanate hai duniyabar ke vaigyanikon ke andhvishwaas ke bare main
 Russian astronauts pee on the rear right wheel of the bus that takes them to the launchpad before boarding a bus-carrying astronaut on board the bus before it goes into superstition
 ye kahani shuru hui 12 april 1961 ko jab euri gagarine antariksh main jane vaale the
 He was extremely restless before the trip
 unhen bahut tej peshaab lagi thi
 He stopped the bus midway and urinated on the rear right wheel
 unka mishan safal rahaa
 This trick has been going on since then
 antariksh yatra se pehle bajte hai romantic gancentiraksh main jane se pehle rus main antariksh yatriyon ke liye bajaayaa jaataa he sangeet
 It was also started by Yuri Gagarin
 rocket main baithne ke baad unhone mishan control centre se koi sangeet bajaane ko kaha
 The Control Center played romantic songs for him
 tab se lekar aaj tak sabhi antariksh yatriyon ke liye vahi gane bajte hai jo gagarine ke liye baje the
 Those astronauts do not see the rocket that they have to go
 Russian astronauts do not see that rocket until they sit in it
 haalanki unki training simulated rocket main karai jaati he
 Gagarin has to do in the guest book Signatureyuri Gagarin went to the space by signing in the guest book kept in his office before the trip
 tab se ise lucky charm maanate hue sabhi antariksh yatri gagarine ke guest book main signechar karke yatra par nikalate hai
 a plant is planted after every successful launch The Baconeur Cosmodrome of Russia is the world's first and largest launchpad
 50 saalon se zyada samay se har safal lonching ke baad ek paudha lagaaya jaataa he
 In Baikonur it is called Avenue of Heroes
 haadasa na ho isliye kooling pipe par likhte hai mahila kaa naintariksh yatra par jane se pehle roosi cosmonot kooling pipe par kisi mahila kaa naam likhte he taaki haadasa na ho
 It is said that once no one had done this work, so 47 people died in the accident
 24 oktober ko launch nahin hota koi rocket24 oktober 1960 or 1963 main baconur main launch se thik pehle do bade haadase hue
 Hundreds of people lost their lives in these accidents
 isliye 24 oktober ko koi lonching nahin hoti
 Tirupati went to worship at the Balaji temple under ISRO Chief

 (photo: ISRO) Mission Director s Arunanan would come out of the Mission Control Center whenever Mangalyaan was put from class to class at the time of isro's worship, new shirt, restlessness and superstition
 unhone ek angreji akhbaar se intervyuu main kaha tha ki ve ye prakriya dekhnaa nahin chaahate
 Whether you believe it to be superstition or something else, the mission was successful
 mangalayan mishan ke vakt pradhanmantri narendra modi isro gaye
 The protocol was that as long as the PM stays in ISRO, no person can come in and out of the Mission Control Center
 lekin arunanan ko unki aadat kii vajah se andar-baahar aane-jane kii vishesh anumati mili thi
 ISRO scientists go to Tirupati Balaji temple before every launch and perform rocket worship
 vahaan rocket kaa chota model chadhaate hai
 a former ISRO director wore a new shirt on every rocket launch day
 ab bhi aisa karne vaale kai vaigyanik hai

 Digvijay Singh said that people of RSS and Modi have called him abusive words in social media like 'dogvijay' and 'pigvijay'
 digvijay singh kaa blog is sawaal ke saath shuru hota he ki ‘kya main hindu virdohi hum
 'he has invited those coming to his home to investigate, who point a finger at his allegiance to Sanatan Dharma
 digvijay singh ne kaha ki unhen ummid he ki anya sabhi log jo sangh ke dushprachaar se galat tareeke se prabhavit hue hai, ve unhen acchhee tarah samajhane kaa prayaas karenge
 He said, 'I know that the' Sanghi gang 'is going to ignore whatever i am saying

 congress mahasachiv ne kaha ki vah ek achche aasthavan hindu hai
 He said that it is his duty to stand against Muslims, Christians and other minority groups against the wrongs being spread by the Sanghis and their salaried professionals
 unhone apane blog main kaha, ‘bijepi ke hindutv kaa dharm se kuch bhi lenaa dena nahin he, balki bhole-bhaale hinduon ko thagne kii chaal he
 a good Hindu association always respects all religions, unlike the brigade
 ’digvijay ne kaha ki vah pratidin aadhe ghante puja karte hai or dwarka or joshi math ke shankaracharya ne unhen ‘diksha’ di thi or madhya pradesh ke raghogarh main unke awaas par nau mandir hai, jahaan har din puja hoti he

 The next hearing of the case will be on 20 February

 yachika main kaha gaya he ki centre sarkaar ne teen saal pehle in maamalon main SIT kaa gathan kiya tha, lekin ye bhi sirf 21 maamalon kii dobaaraa jaanch kar rahi he

 These days, a song from the film 'tevar' is resonating everywhere, 'main To Superman, Salman Ka Fan'
 lekin aaj baat in sab ke 'baap' yani saleem khan kii
 Salim Khan is not fascinated by the introduction on the silver screen
 vah salmaan, arbaj or sohail khan ke pita hai
 The most successful script writer, screenplay and dialogue writer in the Hindi film industry, and recently married his younger daughter Arpita to great fanfare
 saleem khan aaj 79 saal ke ho gaye hai
 But there are many things about this 'indauri Khan' which we are unaware of after 1996, almost away from the screen and writing
 saleem khan kii safalataa kii baangi javed akhtar ke bina adhuri he
 This is because both of them wrote scripts for a total of 24 films in the 70s and 80s, of which 20 films became superhit
 yahi nahin, saleem-javed kii jodi ek script riter ke taur par parde par chamakane vaala pehla naam bhi tha
 Not only this, no one was given the common task of writing scripts, screenplays and dialogues before this pairing
 kuch baaten personal life kisalim khan kaa janm 24 november 1935 ko indore main hua
 His father was in the police
 kachi umr main hi saleem khan ke sir se maa kaa saaya uth gaya
 In 1964, Salim Khan married Sushila Charak, a Brahmin girl from Maharashtra
 shaadi ke baad sushila ne naam badalakar salama rakh liya or 27 disambar 1965 ko unhen salmaan khan ke rup main santan kaa sukh mila
 Salim and Salma have four children
 salmaan ke baad arbaj khan, sohail khan or alvira
 In 1981, Salim Khan married Helen, the famous dancer of his time
 donon ko koi aulad nahin hui, jiske baad kareeb do dashak pehle unhone ek choti bacchee ko god liya or naam rakhaa arpita
 Salim Khan had come to Mumbai to become a hero and wanted to become an actor
 chote-mote kirdaar ke liye unhen shuruyaat main 400 rupee pratimah ke vetan par rakhaa gaya
 He also made small roles in about 14 films, but as an actor, he could not become a special thing
 saleem khan bataur actor jin filmon main najar aae, unamem 1966 main 'teesri manzil' or 'sarahadi looteraa', 1967 main 'divaana' or 1977 main 'vafaadaar' pramukh hai
 When the pair became friends, Salim Khan was beating hands and feet in acting
 'sarahadi looteraa' ke liye javed akhtar dialog likh rahe the
 Javed got this opportunity due to the deterioration of the health of the real dialogue writer
 khayr, yaheen se donon kii dosti hui
 Salim Khan was also writing in those days and assisted writer-director Abrar Alvi
 javed akhtar caphi azmi ko acist karte the
 Alvi and Azmi were neighbors, so Salim and Javed's friendship began to flourish here too
 'kaaka' ne diya bada maukaab tak hindi film industry main screenple, story or dialog kaa kaam kisi ek shaks ko nahin miltaa tha
 His name was not given much attention on the screen, but in the story of salim-javed, Rajesh Khanna gave a twist
 darasal, rajesh khanna ko un dinon ghar (aashirwad) khareednaa tha
 For this, he signed the film 'hathi Mere Sathi'
 lekin yah rimek thi or rajesh khanna ko kahani utani jach nahin rahi thi
 Rajesh had met salim-javed and gave the duo a chance to clear their hands on the screenplay of the film as well as a promise that salim-javed would have written on the screen
 saleem-javed kii jodi yun to pehali baar 'andaaj' main saath ai, lekin 'hathi mere saathi', 'sita or gita', 'yaadon kii baraat' ne unhen mukkamal jahaan diya
 Making Amitabh Bachchan an 'angry young man' through films like 'zanjeer', 'sholay' and 'don' was also the magic of salim-javed's pen
 haalanki 1982 main film 'shakti' ke dauraan is dosti main daraar aa gai or phir donon kii raahen juda ho gayi
 The two last worked together in 1987 for Mr
 India
 dhire-dhire bana lee durijodi tuutane ke baad javed akhtar ne bhale hi likhnaa jari rakhaa, lekin saleem khan ne 1996 ke baad filmon ke liye lekhan ko alavida kah diya
 After his separation from Javed, he wrote the story of films like 'naam', 'patthar Ke Phool', 'storm', 'majdhar' and 'dil Tera Deewana', but could not play the old magic
 lihaaja unhone dhire-dhire duuri bana lee
 However, he definitely gives tips for the story and dialogue of son Salman's many films (veer, Kick, Wanted, Dabangg)

 com / 6nymy1mjrx— Sweety Adimulam (@adimulamsweety)july 10, 2018video main dikh rahaa he ki gaadi jaise hi do pahiyon par rukati he to driver baahar aata he or saamne vaali gaadi (jisamen camera tha) usamen se kuch log aate hai or aapas main baat karnaa shuru kar dete hai
 In the video, the way the vehicle suddenly swings and stands on two wheels is not clear whether it is an accident or a stunt

 There has also been a debate on this video on social media
 ise kuch log haadasa kah rahe hai to kuch ek plan stant

 The industry believes that the government should increase the minimum limit of personal income tax slab from Rs one lakh 60 thousand to Rs two lakh to provide relief to the general income group facing inflation

 In a detailed memorandum submitted to the Finance Ministry on the 2010-11 budget proposals, FICCI said that the beginning of withdrawal of stimulus package in the budget should be postponed till at least 31 October so that the position of industry business becomes a bit stronger

 The industry organization has said that in the case of personal income tax, the above slabs have given considerable relief but 1
 60 lakh se lekar teen lakh rupee kii salanaa aamadani ke varg main koi raahat nahin di gai
 The number of taxpayers in this income group is more than one crore

 The imposition of an import duty of 5 per cent will increase inflationary pressure on the economy

 There has been a relief news from the Delhi High Court for the beggars present in the capital Delhi
 buudhvaar ko ek maamle kii sunwaayee ke dauraan HC ne aise cese main sajaa ko khatm kar diya he
 Now if a Bihari is caught begging on the streets of Delhi, he will not be punished
 court ne ye bhi kaha he ki sabhi bhikhaariyon ko moolbhoot suvidhaayen or swasthya sevaayen muhaiyaa karai jaani chahie
 The HC said during the hearing that punishment of any kind to beggars is against fundamental rights, so they cannot be punished in any kind of criminal case
 dilli hoicourt ne bhikhaariyon ko raahat dete hue bhikshavriti ko aparaadh kii shrenee se hataa diya he
 The court said that any hungry person has the right to ask for bread under Right to Speech
 darasal, bheekh maangate hue agar koi bhi vyakti pakadaa jaataa tha to use 1 se 3 saal kii sajaa kaa praavdhaan tha, jo ab khatm kar di gai he
 When the beggar was caught for the second time, there was a provision for a sentence of up to 10 years, but now it has been abolished after the High Court order
 mumbai privansion of bager act 1959 ko dilli main 2 june 1960 ko lagu kar diya gaya tha
 Beggary has been removed from the category of crime, so the way beggars used to get their fingerprints before they are caught can no longer be done
 court ne apane aadesh main section11 ko barkaraar rakhaa he
 Under this section, if a person commits begging by force, he can be punished for up to 3 years
 yani agar koi vyakti kisi bachche bujurg mahila yaa viklang se sindicket ke tahat bhikshavriti karaata he to us vyakti ke khilaaf kanooneekaryawahi kaa praavdhaan abhi bhi khulaa hua he
 Regarding the removal of beggary from the category of crime, however, central government lawyer Anil Soni believes that this will increase the number of beggars in Delhi
 kyonki dilli se sate or rajyon se bhi bhikhaari dilli main aa jaaenge jisase vah kanoonee rup se surakshit rahen
 Let us tell you that according to government statistics, there are about 4,13,670 beggars in India, including 2,21,673 males and 1,91,997 females
