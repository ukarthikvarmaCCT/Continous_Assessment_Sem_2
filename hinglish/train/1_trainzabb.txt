 kangana ranautki filmamanikarnikarelis se pehle hi vivaadon main chal rahi he
 Sometimes due to its release date, sometimes due to its star cast, the film remains in the headlines
 taaja khabaron kii maane to film kii cast se actorsonu soodabaahar ho chuke hai
 Kangana recently revealed on Sonu
 saath hi unhone kaha ki sonu mahila nirdeshak ke saath kaam nahin karnaa chaahate
 Reacting to Kangana's statements, Hussonu Sudane has given them the opposite answer
 sonu ne kaha- manmanikarnikaki team ko best of lack kahana chahta hum
 Kangana is and will be my good friend
 magar wo lagaataar mere saath women card, victim card khel rahi he
 This is absurd
 jab sonu se kangana ne nirdesan main kaam naa karne ke bare main poocha gaya to sonu ne kaha- nirdeshak kis gender kaa he ye koi mudda nahin he
 It is about competence
 maine farha khan ke saath kaam kiya he
 He specializes in his work
 mere saath unki acchhee dosti he
 Earlier, Kangana recently said in an interview, "I have not met Sonu Sood since the shoot at the end of last year
 vesimbafilm kii shooting main vyast hai
 Even he could not give dates for the shooting of the film by keeping pace with the rest of the cast
 unhone kaam karne se inkaar kar diya
 Sonu is my friend and on his request i also launched the music of one of his films which was produced by him
 sonu ke paas film ke liye dats nahin thi
 Also Kangana has also said that Sonu does not want to work with women directors
 kangana ne aage kaha- jab maine unase pichhali baar baat kii unhone mujhe koi doosraa actor talashne kaa suzav diya
 After this, when i read the script of the film to Zeeshan Job, he agreed to work in it, but he gave a date till September
 tab tak kaaphi der ho jaati
 When Kangana was asked whether the portion of the film that Sonu acted in would be retained, Kangana's answer was "no"
 unke dwaara kiye gaye shoot ko film main shaamil nahin kiya jayega
 Those scenes will be shot again
 ''iske alaava kangana ne is baat kaa bhi khulaasa kiya ki ''sonu ne film main kuch seens khud likhe the
 These scenes were on wrestling

 Now he has written the novel himself, realizing his point

 But it has to reduce its importance to read only as a novel inspired by environmental concerns

 Dinanath Dutta is the 'prudent man' of the novel
 ek adhed pustak vikreta
 He is living a quiet life between Brooklyn and Calcutta
 bahut puraani garlfriend kaa bhoot uske peeche padaa he jisaki vah vajah nahin samaj paata
 In search of romance, he finds himself in Calcutta, where, unlike his saintly life in America, he finds himself in all social situations
 ek party main uski mulaakaat 'chikne-chupade batooni, khokhale, vakt se pehle buudhe or sab-pataa-he'' rishtedaar (jise pathak ghosh ke sunderbans par kendrit upanyaas da hangri tide se jaanate hai) se hoti he or vah use banduukon ke saudagar se milwataa he
 Deenanath (deen in Brooklyn) wrote his doctoral thesis on Bengali folklore hero Chand Sadagar, a businessman who tries to 'escape the tyranny of Mansa Devi who rules over snakes and all other poisonous animals'
 Can not find deenanath ko banduukon kaa saudagar kuch alahada jaan padataa he or itnaa rahasyamayi bhi ki vah duusari jagahon ke alaava sunderbans, venice or los angelis main naammumkin kii khaak chaan chaanane ke liye apni jindagi khalas kar letaa he
 In doing so, he almost loses his control over logic and discretion
 vah apni dost or mashhoor professor jiasinta shiavon se kahata he, ''yah ajeeb mahasoosiyat he, lagata he maano main aape main nahin rahaa
 
 
 As if i am disappearing, losing my will and independence

 On one side is his pride, on the other hand his life and the ominous shadow of his daughter's death
 vahi deenanath ko uski 'vivekwan' baton ke liye lalkaarti he
 He tells her at the beginning of the novel that "I am proud to be a man of my wise, secular, scientific views
" agar yah hindustaniyon kii dakiyanoosee baton ke muafic nahin padataa to mujhe afsos he, main andhvishwaas se bhari us tamaam bakawaas se kabhi raji nahin hounga

 It was like the picture Ghosh showed me on his phone and the Venetian view that was difficult to separate from the Sunderbans
 frid ne ise unhenquilach kaha tha, yani janaa-pahachaanaa hi ajanabi lagane lagata he
 We consider big cities — Los Angeles, Venice, etc
 to be the pinnacle of human success, the building of man
 ghosh hamen unki vilakshan, alokik khoobiyon kii, unki kamajoriyon kii yaad dilaate hai
 And thus Dinanath arrives in a hellish scene like Los Angeles surrounded by wildfire
 venice main vah zyada garm maahaul se aae aagatuk kii tarah ek jahrili makadi se takaraa jaataa he
 After nearly 100 pages in Gun Island, Dinanath boarded an airplane, a "human-made womb, where everything was served to save me from the mud world and its creeping, crawling habitats
" ''tab kahin jaakar use samaj main aata he ki yah uskaa ek or bhulaava he
 This man Dinanath, who is under the risk of disappearing within himself, is forced to collide with the outside world
 use sanpon, sunderbans kii tathvik mitti, loksahitya kii alokik khoobiyon or vartmaan kii paristhitikeey tathaa maanviya aapadaaon ke bich sambandh talashne hi honge, jahaan pravaasiyon ko itani badi taadaad main or aise halaat main apane ghar chhodie ke liye majaboor kar diya gaya he ki ghar kaa vichaar hi purana or bekaar ho gaya he
 Gun Island is not always very sure, but it makes us ask the question of what we believe to be certain

 Lakhs of passengers and students faced heavy inconvenience due to a day-long strike called by Mumbai's largest auto rickshaw union on Monday
 yah hadtaal mumbai ke upnagaron main hi prabhavi rahi, kyonki bandra ke baad mumbai ke hisse main auto rickshaw ke pravesh par pratibandh he
 The strike has been carried out by Sharad Rao-led Mumbai autorecisions Union (MAU) despite raising the minimum fare by one rupee
 kshetreey parivahan praadhikaran (artie) ne pichley saptaah auto rickshaw kaa nunatam kiraaya 11 rupee se badhaakar 12 rupee kar diya tha
 More than 20,000 autorickshaws affiliated with MAU took off from the streets since midnight
 jabaki congress, shivasena or maharashtra navnirmaan sena se sambhddha auto rickshaw sanghathanon ne is hadtaal kaa virodh kiya he or hadtaal se utpann sthiti se nipatane kii koshish main lage hue hai, lekin kam sankhya ke kaaran unki yah koshish naakaafi sabit ho rahi he
 This strike led to long queues of passengers waiting for the best buses, while the students who took the exam thought it was better to leave the house before leaving the valuable time of study to reach the examination centers on time
 is hadtaal ke kaaran bason par bhaar bad gaya or atirikt bason kii vyavastha karne ke baavjood bason main baari bheed rahi
 The comments ek ghante se best bas kii qatari main khadey haresh shah ne kaha ki har tarah ke saarvajanik parivahan ko aavashyak seva ke tahat laayaa janaa chahie
 Shah said, "how can a small group hold the entire passenger community of the city hostage?" Priya Ghanekar, who works in a private company in Andheri, said that during such auto rickshaw strike, taxis should be allowed special operations in the suburbs
 pichley saptaah emeyu ke raav ne rajyavyapee anischitkaaleen hadtaal kii ghoshnaa kii thi, jisamen lagbhag 10 lakh auto rickshon ke shaamil hone kii sambhaavna thi
 But after non-cooperation of other organizations and the RTA allowing an increase in the minimum fare by one rupee, Rao retreated from his stand and turned the broad and indefinite strike into a one-day token strike
 sharad raav ke netritv vaale mumbai autoricshamens union (emeyu) ne nunatam kiraye main ek rupee kii vruddhi karne ke baavjood yah hadtaal kii he
 The Regional Transport Authority (RTA) had last week raised the minimum fare for an auto rickshaw from Rs 11 to Rs 12
 emeyu se sambhddha 20,000 se adhik autoricshaw aadhi raat se hi sadakon se hat gaye
 While auto rickshaw organizations affiliated to Congress, Shiv Sena and Maharashtra Navnirman Sena have opposed the strike and are trying to deal with the situation created by the strike, their efforts are proving to be inadequate due to the low numbers
 is hadtaal ke kaaran best bason kii intjaar karne vaale yatriyon kii lambii kataren lagi raheen, jabaki pariksha dene vaale vidhyaarthiyon ne samay par pariksha kendron tak pahunchane ke liye padhai ke moolyawaan samay ko tilanjali dekar pehle hi ghar se nikalnaa behatar samajha
 Due to this strike, the load on the buses increased and despite arranging additional buses, there was a huge rush in the buses
 tippaniyan Haresh Shah, standing in the queue of Best Bus for over an hour, said that all types of public transport should be brought under essential service
 shah ne kaha, "ek chota sa samooh shahar ke puure yatri samudaay ko kaise bandhak bana saktaa he?" andheri main ek nijee company main kaam karne vaali priya ghanekar ne kaha ki is tarah ke auto rickshaw hadtaal ke dauraan texiyon ko upnagaron main vishesh parichaalan kii anumati di jaani chahie
 Last week, Rao of MAU announced a statewide indefinite strike, which was expected to involve about 1 million auto rickshaws
 lekin anya sanghathanon ke asahyog or artie dwaara nunatam kiraye main ek rupee kii vruddhi kii anumati dene ke baad raav apane rukh se peeche hat gaye or unhone vyapak va anischitkaaleen hadtaal ko ek din ke sankethik hadtaal main badal diya
 This strike led to long queues of passengers waiting for the best buses, while the students who took the exam thought it was better to leave the house before leaving the valuable time of study to reach the examination centers on time
 is hadtaal ke kaaran bason par bhaar bad gaya or atirikt bason kii vyavastha karne ke baavjood bason main baari bheed rahi
 The comments ek ghante se best bas kii qatari main khadey haresh shah ne kaha ki har tarah ke saarvajanik parivahan ko aavashyak seva ke tahat laayaa janaa chahie

 When Bollywood's famous musician vishal-shekhar came on the stage of Agenda Aaj Tak, Tosara atmosphere became melodious
 hit mashin ke naam jane jane vaale in yuva sangeetkaaron ne sawaalon ke jawaab, to diye hi saath hi manch se darshakon ko thirakane ke liye majaboor bhi kar diya
 While answering the questions in the agenda, Shekhar said that why does everyone ask us the same question that we both fight
 15 saal ho gayi saath kaam karte karte jhagade sab ho chuke hai
 When working on a song
 to kisi bhi idia par nayi baaten nikal kar aati hai
 We talk about it, but do not quarrel
 shekhar ne apni sangitamay jivan kii shuruyaat ke bare main bataaya ki unhone kairana gharaane ke ustad niyaaz ahamed khan se shastreey sangeet kii talim lee
 And many people showed them the way
 shekhar ke mutabik unke saathi vishaal ke paas ek gift he jo khaas he wo he seekhney kaa jajba
 Shekhar said that we only make songs, hits make janta
 sab milakar kaam karte hai
 Musician, producer, director
 unhone bataaya ki ham hit gane banane ke liye nahin sochate bas gaanaa banaate hai
 The important thing is that when we make a song, make a CD of it and listen to it in the car ourselves, listen in the house, listen to the family and then decide
 shekhar ne gaanon kii compoxing main nai takanic ke istemaal par kaha ki takneekee upkarnon ke saath bhi agar tradishnal sa maahaul den to mazaa aata he
 With the correct use of technique, the soul of the songs remains the same
 shekhar ne bataaya ki ham donon bhi aise prayog karte hai
 We have recorded songs with 160 people
 takanic behatar banaati he
 It is possible that with the help of technology, the voice of the singer will also develop
 unhone bataaya ki donon ke bich auto tuning he uskaa phayda he
 He said that Vishal and i enjoy when we argue about something
 lungi dance vaale gane ko lekar huye bavaal par shekhar ne kaha ki wo logon ne failaayaa ham or shahrukh ek parivaar he
 The one who created a quarrel was outside
 hamaare bich nahin
 Shekhar told that Sukhwinder Singh, Jagjit Singh, Ustad Niaz Ahmad Sahab, Rafi Sahab are his favorite singers
 hit mashin ke duusare jodidar vishaal ne sawaalon ke jawaab main kaha ki maine shekhar se bahut kuch siikhaa he
 Think less as a musician, more thinking makes things worse
 zyada sochataa hoon ki hit gaanaa bananaa he, to baat nahin banegi
 Let's focus on the song just because the song has to be made
 shekhar kii beti hai jo hamen prerana detii he
 Regarding the new music technique, Vishal said that all the songs are with electric instruments and not that they are bad
 takanic sahyog kare to behatar he lekin wo baisakhi ban jaye to thik nahin hoga
 The soul that composes the song comes from the heart of the composer
 vishaal kaa kahana he ki pehle kam filmein banati thi
 Fewer songs were made
 jo singer the rafee sahab, kishor da, lata di ye sab apane aap main santhaan the
 People used to learn from them
 pehle 5 the lekin aaj ke daur main jo namchin singer hai wo 20 honge, lekin quality to matter karti he
 There are so many directors, producers
 filmein he to naye logon ko mauka mil rahaa he
 Regarding King Khan, Vishal said that Shahrukh has his own line to fight himself
 bahut kam log hai jo logon ko achche se handle karnaa jaanate hai
 Shahrukh specializes in that
 wo kisi ke saath ninsaphi nahin hone dete
 He is very serious about music
 ham aaj kal kaaphi riyaaz kar rahe hai unke saath
 The composer duo also hummed a number of their songs from the agenda stage till date
 jiskaa darshakon ne jamkar lutf uthaaya

 Film: 'yeh Jawani Hai Deewani' Artists: Ranbir Kapoor, Deepika Padukone, Kalki Kekalan and Aditya Roy Kapoor
 yaaron kaa tashan, dhamal road trip, great indian wedding
 The film has every spice that has often helped films in Bollywood to set new records
 doston kii masti hoti he or aakhir film main rishton or pyaar kii kasak sunai dene lagati he
 Ayan Mukherjee brought different shades of life to this new film after a successful knock in Bollywood with 'wake Up Sid'
 film kaa texchar auki mekking kaaphi had tak yuvaaon ko focus main rakhkar kii gai he
 Pritam Chakraborty's music in the film can be called its USP
 'ghaghara', 'budtameez dil', 'kabiraa' or 'dilli vaali garlfriend' jaise gane film main man lagaae rakhte hai
 The first half flows like water, in the second half Ayan seems to be a little confused
 lekin ant aate-aate darshakon ko phir apane saath le lete hai
 If Ranbir and Kalki are the life of the film, then Deepika puts four moons in it
 kahani main kitna damakolege ke chaar dost ambishas bani (ranbir kapur), sharmili-paaramparik naina (deepika), uljhi hui persenelity vaala avi (aditya roy kapur) or dhakad-bindaas aditi (kalki kekalan) road trip par nikalate hai or jidangi se jude har romaanch kaa bharpoor lutf lete hai
 Naina also accompanies him in this trip by coincidence
 padhaaku or chashmish tip kii naina is trip se kai sabak sikhti he
 The trip then ends on a serious note
 dost alag hote hai or phir aage chalakar milte hai
 The film is woven on the lines of 'dil Wale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge' and 'zindagi Milegi Na Dobara'
 second half dekhne ke liye kuch peshans chahie or film kaa ant bilkul nae andaaj se kiya gaya he
 But the shocking scenes in the film's story are less laughable
 film bahut hi sahaj or kaaphi had tak audiyans ke man-mafik chalati he
 Star appellationbir Kapoor continues to grow with every film
 dialog riter ne bhi kaaphi mehnat kii he kyonki baaten ekadam se yuva varg ko khud se conect kar leti hai or cinema haul main jamkar taaliyaan bajati hai
 Like: Naina's mother says - Girls who are more independent become pregnant
 bani kaa yah kahana, flert sehat ke liye acha hota he, jaise yoga, kamaal ke hai
 Deepika is roped in Naina's role
 aditya kapur bhi achche lagate hai
 Kalki Kekalan is amazing
 abhi tak bor or rate-rataae se role karne vaali kalki ne apana nayaa pahalu saamne pesh kiya he
 His alcohol act is a blast
 film mukhya rup se inhen chaar kairactors ke ird-gird buni gai he
 This film full of entertainment and energy is worth the money
 ranbir-deepika kii camestry rang laai he
 Both love shows are good
 deepika-ranbir kaa meetha-sa lip kis seen bhi darshakon ko khichne kaa kaam karegaa
 Ranbir can be expected to do well at the box office because of his appeal to the youth
 khaas yah ki film yuva varg ko dhyaan main rakhkar banaai gai he, mausam chhuttiyon kaa he, pehle din pehle sho main hi lagbhag house phul jaisaa maahaul tha
 Hence, the film can be expected to make a big jump at the box office

 The court's comment was that neither the key witnesses of the prosecution, Kuldeep Chand Kapur, the principal secretary of the home department, nor the home minister exercised their discretion in approving the POTA law on the accused of the Akshardham attack
 supreme court ke mutabik, hamale main aaropee logon ke khilaaf pota kanoon lagane main uchit prakriya kaa istemaal bhi nahin hua
 In addition to this point, considering eight other points, the court criticized the Gujarat police as well as the lower courts for the lewd and malicious deliberations in the ISM case

 bharat main chikitsa kaa kharch badhata ja rahaa he or uskaa ek kaaran yah he ki dawa tathaa upkaran banane vaali kai companiyaan marijon se moti rakam vasuul rahi hai
 There is no one to take care of these patients because there is no regulator in this field
 ek angreji akhbaar ke mutabik medical upkaran banane vaali companiyaan dil ke marijon ke liye banane vaale stant (diisi) ke liye 60,000 rupee se lekar ek lakh rupee tak vasuul rahi hai
 Some even charge more than this, while the cost of a stent in the heart is also between 28 to 48 thousand rupees in developed countries of Europe and UK
 maharashtra sarkaar ke food and drug administration (epad) ne stant sahit is tarah ke upkarnon kii badha-chadhaakar vasuuli ja rahi keemat ke bare main vistrut jaanch kii or neshnal pharma prising athurity (enpipie) ko report di thi
 He said that such medical devices with stents should be brought under price control
 uskaa kahana tha ki aise upkarnon ke liye marijon se 100 fisadi se bhi zyada keemat vasula ja rahaa he
 This report gave an example of how a Mumbai-based company imported a drug-eluting stent for Rs 40,710
 phir use distributor ko 73,440 rupee main diya
 He gave the stent to a renowned hospital in Mumbai
 1 lakh rupee main diya
 The hospital gave the patient 1 for him
 2 lakh rupee vasule
 This means that the patient was charged nearly three times
 is lut kaa kaaran yah he ki is tarah ke upkaran drug price control ke tahat nahin aate hai or isliye unke manamaane daam vasule ja rahe hai
 Multi national companies import them and sell them at an arbitrary price
 un par koi lagaam nahin he

 The comments marathiyon ke vot ke naam par raaj thakare kii is raajnneeti par lagata he congress sarkaar bhi khamosh he
 He feels that Raj Thackeray may not be strengthened further by any action, but the question arises that how long will common people continue to be troubled due to this hate politics of MNS and Shiv Sena

 These people coming from outside Maharashtra told the children studying here that because of them, the jobs of Marathis go away
 tippaniyan In the name of the vote of the Marathas, this politics of Raj Thackeray seems to be silent on the Congress government
 use lagata he ki kahin koi karrwai se raaj thakare or majboot na ho jaae lekin sawaal uthta he ki emenes or shivasena kii is nafrat kii raajnneeti kii vajah se aam log kab tak pareshaan hote rahenge
 Many believe that the government is silent on this matter because it wants such things to strengthen Raj Thackeray's condition and cut the votes of Shiv Sena so that the ruling coalition benefits

 dilli ko sapanom kaa shahar banane kaa sapana philhal atak gaya he
 The promise made by the Modi government to make the capital among the best cities of the world, will not be fulfilled at the moment
 kyonki, modi sarkaar ne dilli ko chamakaane kii yojana ko philhal thande baste main daal diya he
 The Modi government wants to give the capital the status of a world class city
 magar, dilli kii kejariwal sarkaar chaahati he ki world class se pehle buniyadi dhaanche ko majboot banaaya jaae
 The question is, how will the face of Delhi between PM Modi and CM Kejriwal ultimately be? The vision and planning of the Modi government and the Kejriwal government are both very different for the purpose of building Delhi
 donon hi sarkaron ne rajdhani ke liye jo yojanaayen paper par taiyaar kii hai, unamem jameen-aasmaan kaa fark he
 In october-november 2014, the Modi government held 6 high level meetings to plan to make Delhi a world class
 ismerelway, road transport, raksha mantralay samet 19 mantralay shaamil hue
 Several departments of Delhi government also became part of the meeting
 modi sarkaar ne 9 point vaala agenda banaaya
 a budget of Rs 10 crore was made for the new parking
 metro, railway, bas kii connactivity ke liye 2,670 karod kaa plan bana
 2500 crore plan for cycle track and its associated facilities
 nai tarah kii sadaken or footpath ke liye 800 karod kaa bajet
 Made a budget of 2000 crores for best bus facility and 1860 crores for BRRT
 fliover or bypass ke liye 30, 000 karod rupee kaa bajet taiyaar hua
 1200 crores for intelligent transport system, 10 crores budget for planning and monitoring
 dilli ko world class city banane ke liye 41,000 karod rupee kii yojana banaai gai
 The Modi government had started preparations before the assembly elections to groom Delhi
 magar, chunaav nateezon main AAP kii jeet ke baad sabakuch thande baste main chalaa gaya
 The Kejriwal government has termed the dreams of the Modi government and the planning of 41 thousand crore rupees as meaningless
 dilli sarkaar kaa kahana he ki centre ne sirf plan banaaya, lekin paisa nahin diya
 Only Rs 300 crore have been released in the name of schemes worth Rs 41 thousand crore
 aise main world class dilli kaa sapana kaise puraa hoga?kejariwal sarkaar kaa daawa he ki use modi ke sapanom kii nahin, balki dilli waalon ko buniyadi suvidhaayen dilaane kii phikr he
 Therefore, the Kejriwal government, while presenting a report card of one month of functioning, had made no mention of Modi's dream of Delhi
 dilli sarkaar ke rukh se saaf he ki rajdhani ko world class city banane kii disha main abhi kaam shuru bhi nahin hua he
 Because, Kejriwal government wants to make the common man realize the good days
 isliye uski planning ke tahat abhi tamaam buniyadi chijen ko hakeekat main badla jayega
 That is, it will not be easy for the Modi government to fulfill its dream of grooming Delhi in its own way
 ye he modi sarkaar kii planningdilli yun to kai maamalon main desh ke baaki shaharon se kaaphi aage he
 There are all such facilities including metro, which are showing the country's capital growing in the way of progress
 centre sarkaar ne dilli main tarakkee or gadiyon kii raftaar badhaane ke liye kuch khaas planning kii he
 The Modi government has planned to lay a network of flyovers and elevated roads to make Delhi a world class city
 najafagarh elivated road kareeb 30 kilometre tak banane kii yojana he
 The road will be completed by 2018, costing Rs 400 crore
 mahrauli badarpur road ko noida tak le jane kii planning he
 2750 crore rupees for this and the target to complete the work by 2018
 east west corndor banane kii yojana he
 Under this, there is a plan to build a special corridor from Anand Vihar to New Delhi and Punjabi Bagh by spending Rs 2500 crore
 centre ke plan ke mutabik lodhi road se mathura road tak dedh kilometre tunnel road banane kii yojana he
 It will cost about 600 crores to build tunnel road
 iske alaava mahipalpur bypass se enech 8 tak 630 karod rupee kharch karke behatar road banane kii yojana he
 There is a plan to construct a 6 km road from Dhaulakuan to Asaf Ali Road under Barapula Phase 4 by spending Rs 1000 crore
 road or fliover se sambandhit kareeb 15 project ko lekar modi sarkaar ne planning banaai he
 This is Kejriwal government's planning
 The way of working of Kejriwal government is different from Modi government in many ways
 mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal dilli main buniyadi suvidhaayen uplabdh karaane kaa vaada kar rahe hai
 Their emphasis is also on all basic issues
 bijli-pani jaise muddon par wo janata ko sidhe raahat dene kaa elaan pehle hi kar chuke hai
 Now his focus is on some such basic issues of Delhi, which have not received any attention for many years
 kejariwal sarkaar ne dilli main 500 nae sarkari skool kholane kii yojana banaai he
 Emphasis will be given on improving secondary and senior secondary education

 Under this, the student will get a loan after the twelfth on the guarantee of the government

 CCTV cameras will also be installed in buses

 There are plans to run five thousand new buses in five years in Delhi
 metro seva ko dilli ke dur-daraaj ilaakon main pahunchane kii yojana he

 On Friday, militant groups of the NDFB (songbijit) arrived at a market in Chirang district in Assam to eat food and hot clothes, which scared traders and people but the militants left before the police arrived
 sthaneey logon or vyapaariyon ne kaha ki kareeb 15 ugravadi subah 11 bajkar 20 minute par amateka bazaar main aae or iske baad bharat-bhutan seemaa ke paas uttari himalay kii talahati main apane shiviron kii taraf laut gaye
 He said that people standing in the market and traders fled from there after seeing the militants
 jila police adheekshak sanjit krishna ne bataaya ki jaankaree milane ke baad vah police, sena or siarpief karmiyon ke saath bazaar pahunche or ugravadiyon ko pakadaney ke liye talaashi abhiyaan shuru kar diya
 The ruckus in the Aam Aadmi Party has now become completely public
 party ke andar sidhe taur par do gut najar aane lage hai
 Earlier, leaders of the Arvind Kejriwal group made serious allegations against Prashant Bhushan and Yogendra Yadav, in response to which they both wrote an eight-page letter to the activists
 chitthee main yogendra or prashanth ne kejariwal par gambhir aarope lagaae hai
 He has written that the party nominated the communal poster candidate and after the defeat of Lok Sabha, Kejriwal wanted to form a government with the Congress
 chitthee kii prati saarvajanik karte hue yogendra yadav ne kaha, 'pichley kai dinon se party main batichit chal rahi he
 Yesterday morning, four of our friends gave a statement
 uske baad prashanth or maine kaha tha ki ham iskaa swaagat karte hai or likhit main iskaa jawaab denge
 That is why i and Prashant ji have written a letter to Volunteer
 chitthee main prayaas kiya gaya he ki kaaryakartaaon ko sabhi mudde bataae jaaen
 So that healthy communication can happen
 hamane tay kiya he ki philhal ham is mudde par or kuch nahin kahenge
 'read, Letters of activists to yogendra-prashant - 11 March 2015 Dear friends, we know that the events of the last few days have hurt the hearts of all you activists around the country and the world
 dilli chunaav kii aitihaasik vijay se paidaa hua utsaah bhi thanda sa padataa ja rahaa he
 Like you, the question is arising in the mind of every volunteer, why this stalemate in this hour of joining the unprecedented wave and moving forward? The workers want that there should be no break at the top, no break
 jab tivi or akhbaar par party ke sheersh netaaon main matbhed kii khabaren aati hai, aarope-pratyarope chalate hai, to ek saadhaaran walantier asahaay or apamaanit mahasoos karata he
 We are also deeply pained by this situation
 party-hit or aap sab kaaryakartaaon kii bhaawanaaon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue ham donon ne pichley das dinon main apni taraf se is aarope-pratyarope kii kadi main kuch bhi nahin joda
 Answer some important questions, but do not ask questions from your side
 hamane kaaryakartaaon or samarthakon se baar-baar yahi apil kii ki party main aasthaa banaaye rakhen
 Personally, we all have our limitations but in the organization, we meet each other's shortcomings
 isiilie sanghathan bada he or hamamen se kisi bhi vyakti se zyada mahatvapurn he
 With this thinking, we have worked in the party till date and will continue to work
 lekin kal chaar saathiyon (sarvashree manish sisodiya, sanjay singh, gopal raay or pankaj gupta) ke saarvajanik bayaan ke baad ham apni chuppi ko bahut hi baari man se todane par majaboor hai
 The statement, voicing the majority opinion in the national executive, was broadcast on behalf of the party's media cell, and carried on the party's official Facebook, Twitter and website
 aise main yadi ab ham chup rahete hai to iskaa matlab yahi nikaala jaayegaa ki is bayaan main lagaaye gaye aaropon main kuch na kuch sachai he
 Therefore, we want to keep the whole truth in front of you
 aage badhane se pehle ek baat spasht kar den
 In the above statement, some allegations have been made by linking Shanti Bhushan with both of us
 jaisaa ki sarvavidit he, dilli chunaav se pehle shanti bhushan ji ne kai baar aise bayaan die jisase party kii chhavi or party kii chunavi taiyaari ko nuksaan ho saktaa tha
 These statements caused disappointment and discontent among the party workers
 aise maukon par ham donon ne shanti bhushan ji ke bayanon se saarvajanik rup se asahmati zaahir kii thi
 Since both of us do not get the opinion of Shanti Bhushan on these issues, it is better to ask questions related to them
 aage padhein, sanyojak pad nahin kuch or he matbhed kaa muddisase judi ek or mithyaa dharna kaa khandan shuru main hi kar dena jaruri he
 In the last two weeks, it has been repeatedly propagated that all this differences are about the post of National Convenor
 yah kaha gaya ki arvind bhai ko hataakar yogendra yadav ko sanyojak banane kaa shadyantr chal rahaa tha
 The truth is that neither of us has made any such mention in any formal or informal meeting till date
 jab 26 farvari kii baithak main arvind bhai ke istife kaa prastaav aayaa tab ham donon ne unke istife ko naamanzoor karne kaa vot diya
 Whatever be the issue, the post of national convenor was neither an issue, nor is it
 yah sach jaanane ke baad sabhi walantier poochhate hai “agar rashtriya sanyojak pad par vivaad nahin tha to aakhir vivaad kis baat kaa? itnaa gaharaa matbhed shuru kaise hua?” hamane yathasambhav is sawaal par chuppi banaaye rakhi, taaki baat ghar kii charadivari se baahar naa jaae
 But now we feel that until you do not know this, then doubt and uncertainty can also arise in your mind
 isliye ham neeche un mukhya baton kaa zikr kar rahe hai jinke chalate pichley das mahino main aravind bhai or anya kuch saathiyon se hamaare matbhed paidaa hue
 You tell me, should we have raised this issue or not? 1
 lok-sabha chunaav ke parinaam aate hi arvind bhai ne prastaav rakhaa ki ab ham dubaara congress se samarthan lekar dilli main phir se sarkaar bana len
 Despite all efforts to persuade, he and some other colleagues remained adamant on this
 dilli ke adhikansh vidhayakon ne unka samarthan kiya
 But most of the activists and leaders in Delhi and around the country who came to know, opposed it, and even threatened to leave the party
 party ne hai court main vidhansabha bhang karne kii maang kar rakhi thi
 Even the Congress party was rejected by the people in the Lok Sabha elections
 aise main congress ke saath gathbandhan party kii saakh ko khatm kar saktaa tha
 We raised this voice within the party
 yah aagrah bhi kiya ki aisa koi bhi nirnay pi
 a
 si or rashtriya kaaryakarini kii raay ke mutabiq kiya jaae
 But a letter was written to the lieutenant governor and an attempt was made to form the government
 yah koshish vidhaan sabha ke bhang hone se thik pehle november maah tak chalati rahi
 (here and in many other places in this letter, we are not making public some secret things in the interest of the party) Both of us opposed this on every platform within the organization
 isi prashn par sabase gahare matbhed kii buniyaad padi
 We leave it to you to decide whether it was right to protest
 agar us samay party congress ke saath milakar sarkaar bana leti to kya ham dilli kii janata kaa vishwaas dobaaraa jeet pate?2
 As soon as the results of the Lok Sabha elections came, Manish Sisodia, Sanjay Singh and Ashutosh started making a strange demand
 unhone kaha ki haar kii jimmevary lete hue pi
 a
 si ke sabhi sadsy apana istipha aravind bhai ko saunpe, taaki ve apni suvidha se nayi pi
 a
 si kaa gathan kar sake
 The demand for the dissolution of the national executive arose
 ham donon ne anya saathiyon ke saath milakar iskaa kadaa virodh kiya
 (P
 By Yogendra
 e
 C
 se istife kii peshkash isi ghatana se judy thi) agar ham aisi asanvaidhanik chaalon kaa virodh na karte to hamaari party or congress yaa basapa jaisi party main kya farak rah jaataa ?3
 In June, the party's national executive was instructed to seek the views of party workers on the question of the party contesting elections in Maharashtra, Haryana, Jharkhand and Jammu and Kashmir
 kaaryakartaaon kaa mat jaanane ke baad hamaari or rashtriya kaaryakarini ke bahumat kii yah raay thi ki rajyon main chunaav ladane kaa faisla rajya ikai ke vivek par chhod dena chahie
 This was not acceptable to Arvind Bhai
 unhone kaha ki agar kahin par bhi party chunaav ladi to ve prachaar karne nahin jaayenge
 Accepting his request, the National Executive had to reverse its decision, and decided not to contest in the states
 aaj yah faisla sahi lagata he, usase party ko phayda hua he
 But the question is how to take such a decision in future? Is it wrong to raise the question of the autonomy of the states in our party who believe in the principle of Swaraj? 4
 july maheene main jab congress ke kuch muslim vidhayakon ke bijepi main jane kii afvaah chali, tab dilli main muslim ilaakon main ek gumnaam sampradayik or bhadakaau poster laga
 Police alleged that this poster was installed by the party
 shri dilip pandey or do anya walantier ko aaropee bataakar is maamle main giraftaar bhi kiya
 a poster worker Mr
 Amanatullah took responsibility for this poster, and Arvind Bhai demanded his arrest (later he was made in-charge of Okhla and then the party's candidate) Yogendra made a public statement that such posters are the ideology of the Aam Aadmi Party Are against saath hi vishwaas jataayaa ki is maamle main giraftaar saathiyon kaa is ghatana se koi sambandh nahin he
 The party said on one hand that we have nothing to do with these posters, but on the other hand, Yogendra's statement was anti-party, and there was a lot of poison among the activists against him
 aap hi bataaiye, kya aise mudde par hamen chup rahanaa chahie tha?5
 When party worker Karan Singh was expelled by the Delhi unit on charges of creating an organization called Awam, Karan Singh appealed against the decision to the National Discipline Committee, headed by Prashant Bhushan
 karan singh ke viruddh party-virdohi gatividhiyon kaa ek pramaan yah tha ki unhone party walantiaron ko ek es
 M
 es bhejkar bijepi ke saath judane kaa aahvaan kiya tha
 Karan Singh argued that this s
 em
 s is a fake, sent by party officials to defame him
 anushaasan samiti kaa adhyaksh hone ke naate prashanth bhushan ne is maamle kii kadi jaanch par jor diya, lekin party ke padaadhikari taal-matol karte rahe
 Finally, at the request of Karan Singh, the police investigated and s
 em
 s was found to be fake
 pataa laga kii yah es
 M
 es deepak choudhary naamak walantier ne bhijwai thi
 On the contrary, Prashant Bhushan was accused of favoring Aamam for conducting the investigation in a fair manner
 isame koi shaq nahin ki baad main avam party virdohi kai gatividhiyon main shaamil rahaa, lekin aap hi bataaie agar koi kaaryakarta anushaasan samiti main apil kare to uski nishpaksh sunwaayee honi chahie yaa nahin?6
 When the candidates for the Delhi elections started getting selected, then both of us started getting serious complaints from some party workers
 shikaayat yah thi ki chunaav jeetne ke dabaav main aise logon ko tikat diya ja rahaa tha jinke viruddh sangeen aarope the, jinka charitra baaki partiyon ke netaaon se alag nahin tha
 There were also complaints that the old volunteer was being sidelined and local activists were being rigged about the ticket
 aise main ham donon ne yah aagrah kiya ki sabhi ummidavaaron ke bare main puri jaankaree pehle pi
 a
 si or phir janata ko di jaye, aise ummidavaaron kii puri jaanch honi chahie or antim faisla pi
 a
 si main vidhivat charchaa ke baad liya janaa chahie, jaisaa ki hamaare samvidhan main likhaa he
 Wasn't it our duty to say so? In this case, instead of honoring our request, we were accused of obstructing the election

 Twelve candidates were then examined by the Lokpal, two had their tickets canceled, four were found innocent and the remaining six were allowed to file nominations
 aap hi bataaie, kya aap ise party kii maryaada or pratishtha bachaae rakhane kaa prayaas kahenge yaaki party-virdohi gatividhi?aage padhein, kya the yogendra-prashanth ke prastaavin chah bade muddon or anek chote-bade sawaalon par ham donon ne paardarshita, loktantr or swaraj ke un siddhanton ko baar-baar uthaaya jinhen lekar hamaari party bani thi
 We raised these questions within the party walls and at the appropriate stage

 Everything should not be decided from Delhi
 3

 e
 c and National Executive meetings should be regular and lawful
 4
 There should be adequate arrangement to listen and respect the voice of volunteers in party decisions
 hamane in sansthagat muddon ko uthaaya or iske badale main hamen mili managasaint aarope
 We made every effort to save both the unity of the party and its soul and we were accused of harming the party
 aarope ye ki ham donon party ko harwane kaa shadyantr rach rahe the, ki ham party ke viruddh dushprachaar kar rahe the, ki ham sanyojak pad hathiyaane kaa shadyantr kar rahe the
 The allegations are so ridiculous that there is no desire to answer them
 yah bhi lagata he ki kahin inkaa jawaab dene se inhen garima to nahin mil jaayegi
 Nevertheless, as these have been repeated over and over, it will be useful to clarify some facts so that there is no room for doubt in your mind
 (patr lambaa na ho jaye isliye ham yahan pramaan nahin de rahe hai
 Some documents Yogendra's Facebook https: / / www
 facebook
 com / aapyogendra) There was an allegation that Prashant Bhushan tried to defeat the party in the Delhi elections
 dilli chunaav main ummidavaaron ke chayan ke bare main jo sachai upar bataai ja chuki he, ise lekar prashanth bhushan kaa man bahut khinn tha
 Prashant did not want the party to win elections by compromising with its principles
 unka kahana tha ki galat raste par chalakar chunaav jeetna party ko antat barbaad or khatm kar degaa
 Better than that, the party will stick to its principles, even if it has to remain in a minority
 unhen yah bhi dar tha agar party ko bahumat se do-teen siten neeche yaa upar aa gayi to vah jod-tod ke khel kaa shikaar ho sakati he, party ke hi kuch sandehaaspad ummidavaar party ko blakemel karne kii koshish kar sakate hai
 Expressing such feelings and praying or trying to defeat the party are two completely different things
 yogendra ne party ko kaise nuksaan panhuchaya, iskaa koi khulaasa aarope main nahin kiya gaya he
 As everyone knows, in this election Yogendra held between 80 and 100 public meetings, addressed the media every day, conducted poll surveys and predicted and phoned activists and Google hangouts
 ek doosraa aarope yah he ki prashanth bhushan ne party ke khilaaf press kaunference karne kii dhamkee di
 The truth is that Prashant, who was disgusted with the selection of candidates, had said that if the party does not make satisfactory arrangements for checking the character of the candidates, then they will be forced to make the matter public
 aise main, yogendra yadav sahit party ke pandrah varisht saathiyon ne prashanth ke ghar teen din kii baithak kii
 It was decided that the suspected candidates will be investigated by the Lokpal and the decision of the Lokpal will be final
 yahi hua or lokapal kaa nirnay aane par ham donon ne use purnatah sweekaar bhi kiya
 The party should be proud that for the first time in the country, a party made an independent system and checked its candidates
 ek or aarope yah bhi he ki yogendra ne chandigarh main patrakaron ke saath ek brakefast meeting main “da hindu” akhbaar ko yah soochna di ki haryana chunaav kaa faisla karte samay rashtriya kaaryakarini ke nirnay kaa sammaan nahin kiya gaya
 This allegation was made by a female journalist in a telephone conversation, which was also recorded in secret
 lekin is kathan ke saarvajanik hone ke baad usee baithak main maujuud ek or varisht patrkaar, shri es pi singh ne lekh likhakar khulaasa kiya ki us baithak main yogendra ne aisi koi baat nahin bataayi thi
 He has asked that if any such thing would have been told, then why did the remaining three journalists who were present at that breakfast not publish this news? Link to his article http: / / www
 caravanmagazine
 in / vantage / indian-express-yogendra-yadav-indian-journalism
 aarope yah bhi he ki dilli chunaav ke dauraan kuch anya sampadakon ko yogendra ne party-virdohi baat bataai
 If this is the case, why are the names of those editors not made public? Then there is an allegation that Prashant and Yogendra supported the Awam Group
 upar bataaya ja chukaa he ki prashanth ne anushasansmiti ke adhyaksh ke naate awam ke karan singh ke maamle main nishpaksh jaanch kaa aagrah kiya
 How can a judge's work be called indiscipline? No evidence was presented against Yogendra in this matter
 ulte, awam ke logon ne yogendra par email likh kar aarope lagaae jiskaa yogendra ne saarvajanik jawaab diya tha
 When Awam made false allegations against the party a week before the election, Yogendra played the most important role in denying these allegations
 phir bhi chunki yah aarope lagaaye gaye hai, to unki jaanch jarur honi chahie
 The party's legislation says that any charges against members of the national executive can be investigated by the party's national ombudsman
 swayan lokapal ne chitthee likhakar kaha he ki ve aisi koi bhi jaanch karne ke liye taiyaar hai
 We are both requesting the Lokpal to investigate the allegations of these four comrades
 agar lokapal hamen doshi pate hai to unke dwaara tay kii gayi kisi bhi sazaa ko ham sweekaar karenge
 But we do not understand why these allegations are being made in the media instead of conducting an inquiry under party legislation? Friends, this watch is both a crisis and an opportunity for the party
 itani badi jeet ke baad yah avasar he bade man se kuch bade kaam karne kaa
 This is not a time to get into small disputes and you
 pichley kuch dinon ke vivaad se kuch nihit swaarthon ko phayda hua he or party ko nuksaan
 The only way to overcome this is that all the facts should be presented to all the workers
 yah party kaaryakartaaon ke khun-paseene se bani he
 Ultimately, you volunteer will decide what is true and what is false
 ham sab raajnneeti main sachai or imaanadaaree kaa sapana lekar chale the
 You decide whether we have compromised with the ideals of truth, virtue and swaraj? Your decision will be on our head
 aap sab tak pahunchaane ke liye ham yah chitthee media ko de rahe hai
 We hope that the party will disseminate this letter, respecting the minority, in the same manner as the statement of four other colleagues was broadcast yesterday
 lekin ham media main chal rahe is vivaad ko or aage nahin badhanaa chaahate
 We do not want the party to be shunned in the media
 isliye is chitthee ko jari karne ke baad ham philhal maun rahanaa chaahate hai
 We appeal that all party mates keep silence in this matter for the next few days so that there is a chance to heal the wounds, there is a chance to think something meaningful
 doston, aravind bhai swasthy laabh ke liye bengalore main hai
 Like everyone, we also worry about his health
 aaj aravind bhai sirf party ke nirvivaad netaa hi nahin, desh main svachh raajnneeti ke pratik he
 All party workers want that they can be healthy and fulfill their responsibilities towards Delhi and the country
 hamen vishwaas he ki vaapis aakar aravind bhai party main ban gaye is gatirodh kaa koi samaadhaan nikaalenge jisase party kii ekta or aatma donon bachi rahen
 We both want to assure all of you that we will give all possible support in any effort to save the party without compromising the principles, we have made every effort to defend ourselves on our behalf so far, and welcomed every such effort
 is
 jo bhi ho, ham ahm ko aade nahin aane denge
 Whether or not we both held any position is not an issue
 bas party apane siddhanton or lakhon kaaryakartao ke sapanom se judy rahe, yahi ekmaatr mudda he
 Both of us will continue to work for the party by staying within the party discipline

 The area's SP Jalinder Supekar told NDTV that a total of five teams have been formed to nab the accused and all will be nabbed soon

 Almost everyone was expecting a spectacular victory for the BJP and for the first time, even the exit poll proved something right

 "it is being accepted within the BJP that Dhumal's defeat was decided at the hands of his own disciple Rajinder Rana, just as the bjp's victory was being decided

 Some political experts even believe that the way the BJP was hesitant in announcing the face of the Chief Minister and many other names were being discussed, mainly the Union Health Minister Jagat Prasad Nadda
 It was from this that it seems that Dhumal's political assassination has been done in a very thoughtful manner
 haalanki yah atkal dur kii kaudi hi lagati he
 But this much is clear that many other leaders were involved in the race for the post of Chief Minister
 amit shah ne jis din dhumal ke naam kii ghoshnaa kii, usase do din pehle 29 november ko nadda ne india today ke saath baatcheet main bataaya tha, ''janata ko faisla karnaa he (ki vah kise mukhyamantri bananaa chaahati he)

 zyaadaatar parshad karodpati kaa darja praapt kar chuke hai
 The assets of a candidate is more than 600 crores
 nagarpalika ke chunaav ko lekar hamaari aapaki beyrukhee kaa hi ye sab nateeja he
 Whereas local newspapers are constantly flooded with news of the city problem and municipal elections
 iske baad bhi mumbai kii sakriyata matdaan pratishat se nazar nahin aati he
 This time economic survey has a chapter on the revenue and work performance of local bodies
 aarthik survey main is chapter kaa hona bataa rahaa he ki shaharikaran kii chunautiyaan bhayaavah hoti ja rahi hai
 Everyone has to be interested in the way they work and the tax collection system
 aarthik survey main janaaagrah naam kii ek sanstha kaa zikr he jisane 21 shaharon ke adhyayan ke aadhaar par bataaya he ki in nikaayon ke paas kanoon kii kami nahin he
 Rather, where there is more law, recovery is less and where there are less, recovery is more
 jaise kanpur or dehradun jaise shaharon ke paas tex vasuuli ke kanoonee adhikaar mumbai se kahin behatar hai magar vahaan property tex kii vasuuli kaa record bahut karaab he
 Mumbai and Pune have fewer rights, yet revenue collection is much better
 bharat main 8000 shahar or nagar hai
 Mumbai ranks at number 50 in the ranking of Global City and Delhi at number 47
 bharat kaa number van shahar duniya ke bade shaharon main 50wein number par aata he
 Then he fulfills the dreams of millions of people, think if Mumbai were in the first ten number then how much could have been given, but for this we also have to give something to Mumbai
 aarthik survey main likhaa he ki shahari vikaas mantralay kii ek hailavel cameti ne hisaab lagaaya he ki agle 20 saal main shahari dhaanche ko behatar karne ke liye 39 lakh karod kii zarurat hogi
 This calculation is based on 2009-10 prices
 pani, bijli, sadak or parivahan par itane kharch ke baad inke rakrakhaav or sanchaalan ke liye alag se 20 lakh karod kii or zarurat hogi
 The 14th Finance Commission has made a provision of giving 87,000 crores for 2015 to 20 to all the municipalities and corporations of the country
 zarurat ke hisaab se yah raashi kuch bhi nahin he magar pichhali sarkaron se tulana karen to 227 pratishat adhik di gai he
 The bulk of this will have to be mobilized by the local bodies at their own level
 aarthik survey se pataa chalata he ki kanpur or lakhanu main 50 fisadi rajasav sampatti kar se aata he
 Kolkata Municipal Corporation lags behind Kanpur and Lucknow in this case
 bhopal or ranchi ke rajasav main sampatti kar kii bhagidaari 15 fisadi se bhi kam he
 In Jaipur and Bangalore, only 5 to 20 per cent of the taxable property is taxed
 36 shahar 4400 karod kaa sampatti kar vasuulate hai jise agar wo chahen to badhaakar 22,000 karod kiya ja saktaa he
 This means that if the municipalities or corporations run in a professional manner and the scope of corruption is less, then they will have more money for the convenience of common citizens
 aarthik survey main bataaya gaya he jin nagarpalikaon ne zyada rajasav vasule hai unhone behatar suvidhaayen bhi di hai
 Now look at another figure
 mumbai main ek lakh kii aabaadi par 895 karmchaaree hai
 Delhi has 1260 employees on a population of one lakh
 neuyork main ek lakh kii aabaadi par 5,338 karmchaaree hai
 London has 2,961 employees at a population of one million
 isse yah pataa chalata he ki jab tak rajasav nahin hoga, karmchaaree nahin honge, nagarikon ko buniyadi suvidhaayen nahin milengi or unka rakrakhaav thik nahin hoga
 The condition of employees of most municipalities is not good
 samay se vetan nahin miltaa he or theke par kaam karne waalon ko bina hadtaal ke wo bhi nahin miltaa he
 Why this aspect has not been given prominence in the economic survey is not understood
 tamaam akhabaaron main mumbai kii samasyaon par chhapi khabaron se aapke liye kuch suchi banaai he
 The Midday newspaper has written that 1200 auto taxi stands have disappeared from Mumbai
 atikaraman kar liya gaya he
 There are only 300 stands where fights take place to park
 mumbai main 1900 kimi hi sadaken hai magar 28 lakh gadiyon ko park karne ke liye 3,300 kimi sadak jitani lambii jagah chahie
 The comments iskaa samaadhaan saarvajanik parivahan se lekar adhik parking tex ke rup main bataaya jaataa rahata he
 Shashank Rao of mid-day has suggested making 56,000 parking spots
 footpath gaayab hai balki wo to rojgaar srijan kaa madhyam bane hue hai
 Citizens say that the elected representative does not take all these things into consideration, but seeing the voting percentage, it does not seem that the citizens are also interested in choosing the representative

 Tanvi Deshpande of Mumbai Mirror has made a good report on why we need a councilor
 tanvi deshpandey ne subah chah baje se lekar raat ke nau baje ke bich aapaki vyastata ke hisaab se yah suchi banaai he ki kab kab aapako parshad kii zarurat padegi or kaise ek behatar parshad aapke ghar se daftar jane ke maahaul ko behatar kar saktaa he
 i am putting some part of it here
 pani supplai kaa jimmaa biemasi kaa he
 If there is no water in the tap, whom will you call? zaahir he parshad ko hi phone karenge
 The councilor of your area will call the bmc's local engineer as to why the water is not coming
 50 se 60 pratishat aabaadi slam main rahati he
 To catch the local you go to catch the bus of the best but the bus arrives quite late and is also full
 sthaneey parshad hi biemasi main dabaav banayega ki aapke ilaake main bas kii zarurat he
 4 million people travel with the best buses
 footpath par atikaraman he to tasviir lekar aap parshad ko bhej sakate hai ki sudhaar kiijie
 If you feel that fire safety rules have not been followed in a building, then the councilor can get the building checked at your request
 aapke ilaake kii sadak karaab he to parshad kii zimmedaari banati he ki acchhee sadak kii vyavastha kare
 The same will apply before the committee of the municipality and will pressurize it to pass the proposal

 It is possible that many educated people do not know what they should vote for the councilor
 magar aae din pareshaan mumbai se ve bhi pareshaan rahete honge to phir vot kyon nahin dete hai
 The 2007 municipal election saw only 46 percent turnout, which decreased to 45 percent in 2012
 vot dene kaa utsaah bhale na nazar aata ho magar chunaav ladane vaale khub hai
 2,275 candidates from 13 parties are contesting the election of corporator
 public park, skool, pani, footpath, parking, street lite na jane angit masale hai jise lekar shahar ke log nagarpalika chunaav main shirkat kar sakate the

 It has been written in the Economic Survey that a High Level Committee of the Ministry of Urban Development has calculated that 39 lakh crores will be needed to improve the urban infrastructure in the next 20 years
 yah hisaab 2009-10 kii keemton ke aadhaar par lagaaya gaya he
 After spending so much on water, electricity, road and transport, another 20 lakh crore will be required for their maintenance and operation
 14wein vitt ayog ne desh ke tamaam nagarpalikaon or nigamon ko 2015 se 20 ke liye 87,000 karod dene kaa praavdhaan kiya he
 This amount is nothing according to the need, but compared to the previous governments, 227 percent more has been given
 iskaa bada hissaa sthaneey nikaayon ko apane str par hi jutanaa hoga
 Economic survey shows that in Kanpur and Lucknow, 50 percent of revenue comes from property tax
 is maamle main kolkata nagar nigam kanpur or lakhanu se peeche he
 Property tax accounts for less than 15 per cent of revenue in Bhopal and Ranchi
 jaipur or bengalooru main kar yogya sampatti kaa 5 se 20 fisadi hissaa hi tex detaa he
 36 cities charge property tax of 4400 crores which can be increased to 22,000 crores if they want
 iskaa matlab yah hua ki agar nagarpalikaayen yaa nigam peshewar tareeke se chalem or bhrashtachar kaa scope kam ho to unke paas aam nagarikon kii suvidha ke liye adhik paise honge
 It has been told in the Economic Survey that the municipalities which have recovered more revenue have also provided better facilities
 ab ek or aankada dekh lijie
 There are 895 employees in Mumbai with a population of one lakh
 dilli main ek lakh kii aabaadi par 1260 karmchaaree hai
 New York has 5,338 employees on a population of one million
 landan main ek lakh kii aabaadi par 2,961 karmchaaree hai
 This shows that unless there is no revenue, there will be no employees, citizens will not get basic facilities and their maintenance will not be right
 zyaadaatar nagarpalikaon ke karmchaariyon kii sthiti thik nahin he
 Salary is not paid on time and contract workers do not get it without strike
 aarthik survey main is pahalu ko kyon nahin pramukhataa di gai he, samaj nahin aayaa
 All the newspapers have made some list for you from the news printed on the problems of Mumbai
 mid de akhbaar ne likhaa he ki mumbai se 1200 auto taxi stand gaayab ho gaye hai
 Encroachment has been done
 300 stand hi bache hai jahaan park karne ke liye aae din jhagade hote rahete hai
 There are only 1900 km of roads in Mumbai, but to park 28 lakh trains, a place as long as 3,300 km of road is required
 tippaniyan The solution remains to be described as public transport to more parking tax
 mid de ke shashaank raav kii report main 56,000 parking spot banane ke suzav diye gaye hai
 The pavements are missing, rather they remain the medium of employment generation
 nagarikon kaa kahana he ki chune hue pratinidhi in sab baton par dhyaan nahin dete, magar matdaan pratishat dekhakar nahin lagata ki naagarik bhi pratinidhi ko chunane main dilchaspee lete hai
 Garbage disposal is a major challenge
 har khuli jagah par kachra phenkaa ja rahaa he
 Places are disappearing
 mumbai mirar kii tanvi deshpandey ne ek acchhee report banaai he ki hamen parshad kyon chahie
 Tanvi Deshpande has made this list according to your busy time between six in the morning and nine in the night, when you will need a councilor and how a better councilor can improve the atmosphere from your home to office
 main uskaa kuch hissaa yahaan rakh rahaa hum
 BMC is responsible for water supply
 nalke main pani nahin aayaa to aap kise phone karenge
 Obviously, we will call the councilor
 aapke ilaake kaa parshad hi biemasi ke sthaneey ejeeniyar ko phone karegaa ki pani kyon nahin aa rahaa he
 50 to 60 percent of the population lives in slums
 local pakadan ke liye aap best kii bas pakadaney jate hai magar bas kaaphi der se aati he or bhari hui bhi hoti he
 The local councilor will put pressure on the BMC that a bus is needed in your area
 40 lakh log best kii bason se safar karte hai
 If there is an encroachment on the pavement, then by taking a picture, you can send it to the councilor to improve
 agar aapako lagata he ki kisi imaarat main fire sefti ke niyamon kaa paalan nahin hua he to aapke kehane par parshad us imaarat kii jaanch karvaa saktaa he
 If the road in your area is bad then it is the responsibility of the councilor to arrange for a good road
 vahi nagarpalika kii cameti ke saamne arji degaa or prastaav paas karaane kaa dabaav banayega
 It was a good newspaper effort
 mumkin he bahut se padhe likhe logon ko pataa hi na ho ki ve kis liye parshad ko vot karen
 But they will be troubled by the troubled Mumbai in the coming days, so why not vote again
 iskaa matlab yah hua ki agar nagarpalikaayen yaa nigam peshewar tareeke se chalem or bhrashtachar kaa scope kam ho to unke paas aam nagarikon kii suvidha ke liye adhik paise honge

 tanvi deshpandey ne subah chah baje se lekar raat ke nau baje ke bich aapaki vyastata ke hisaab se yah suchi banaai he ki kab kab aapako parshad kii zarurat padegi or kaise ek behatar parshad aapke ghar se daftar jane ke maahaul ko behatar kar saktaa he
 i am putting some part of it here
 pani supplai kaa jimmaa biemasi kaa he
 If there is no water in the tap, whom will you call? zaahir he parshad ko hi phone karenge
 The councilor of your area will call the bmc's local engineer as to why the water is not coming
 50 se 60 pratishat aabaadi slam main rahati he
 To catch the local you go to catch the bus of the best but the bus arrives quite late and is also full
 sthaneey parshad hi biemasi main dabaav banayega ki aapke ilaake main bas kii zarurat he
 4 million people travel with the best buses
 footpath par atikaraman he to tasviir lekar aap parshad ko bhej sakate hai ki sudhaar kiijie
 If you feel that fire safety rules have not been followed in a building, then the councilor can get the building checked at your request
 aapke ilaake kii sadak karaab he to parshad kii zimmedaari banati he ki acchhee sadak kii vyavastha kare
 The same will apply before the committee of the municipality and will pressurize it to pass the proposal
 akhbaar kaa yah prayaas acha laga
 It is possible that many educated people do not know what they should vote for the councilor
 magar aae din pareshaan mumbai se ve bhi pareshaan rahete honge to phir vot kyon nahin dete hai
 It was a good newspaper effort
 mumkin he bahut se padhe likhe logon ko pataa hi na ho ki ve kis liye parshad ko vot karen
 But they will be troubled by the troubled Mumbai in the coming days, so why not vote again

 The Supreme Court will deliver an important verdict on Thursday in the Uber rape case
 aaropee driver kii yachika par dilli hoicourt ne peedita samet 13 logon kii dobaaraa gavaahi kaa aadesh diya tha
 Hearing the appeal of the victim and the Delhi Police against this, the Supreme Court stayed the trial in the lower court itself
 supreme court yah tay karegaa ki peedita or baaki logon kii dobaaraa gavaahi ho yaa nahin
 Only after this verdict, the stayed trial will be able to resume
 iske saath hi supreme court aise maamalon main dobaaraa gavaahi par koi guideline bhi jari kar saktaa he
 During the hearing, the Supreme Court had made strict remarks on the accused
 court ne kaha tha ki jis tarah aaropee shiv kumaar yadav ne kanoon kaa istemaal kiya, vah galat he
 According to you, the law will be destroyed if the law works
 kisi apradhi ko sajaa nahin ho paaegi, na hi koi trial puraa hoga
 What you are saying is that the criminal should sit on his head and respect him
 justise je es khehar kii aguwai vaali bench ne kaha tha ki aap jis kanoon ke tahat dobaaraa jirah kar rahe hai, uske tahat duusare bhi uskaa beja istemaal kar sakate hai
 The court said that the accused is the master of the legal bets and punches and he played the best bets in the court to break the case
 aisi yojana taiyaar kii jo cab driver ke liye mumkin nahin
 Despite being a judge of the Supreme Court, it does not even come to our mind
 tippaniyan The court said it is clear that someone behind this is giving accurate legal advice to the accused, under which the witnesses were called again for cross-examination, from changing the lawyers in the trial
 aaropee ne kai maheene tak sirf vakt jaaya kiya, trial main deree kii
 The accused repeatedly tortured the victim
 rape peedita ke liye court main baar-baar bayaan dena kitna mushkil hota he
 After the victim, the Delhi Police had also filed a petition in the Supreme Court, saying that there should be no repeat statement of the victim
 police kii yah bhi daleel thi ki 16 disambar ke gangrape ke baad desh main kanoon main badlaav kiya gaya
 If the victim recounts, then the whole exercise will be in vain
 is faisle ke baad hi rukaa mukadmaa phir se chaalu ho paaegaa
 In addition, the Supreme Court can also issue a guideline on re-testimony in such cases
 sunwaayee ke dauraan supreme court ne aaropee par sakht tippanee kii thi
 The court had said that the way the accused Shiv Kumar Yadav used the law is wrong
 aapke hisaab se kanoon chalegaa to system dhwast ho jayega
 No criminal will be punished, nor will any trial be completed
 aap jo kah rahe hai, uskaa matlab yah he ki apradhi ko sir maathe par baithaana chahie or uskaa sammaan karnaa chahie

 The comments court ne kaha saaf he iske peeche koi or aaropee ko sateek kanoonee salaah de rahaa he, jiske tahat trial main vakeelon ko badalane se lekar gavaahon ko dobaaraa jirah ke liye bulaayaa gaya
 The accused spent only time for several months, delaying the trial
 aaropee ne peedita ko baar-baar pratadit kiya
 How difficult it is for a rape victim to make repeated statements in court
 peedita ke baad dilli police ne bhi supreme court main yachika daakhil kar kaha tha ki peedita ke dobaaraa bayaan nahin hone chahie
 The police also argued that the law was changed in the country after the December 16 gang-rape
 agar peedita ke dobaaraa bayaan hote hai to sari kavayad bekaar ho jaaegi

 Working in the style of the RSS, the AAP then established 13 parliamentary zones, each headed jointly by an in-charge from Delhi and a local coordinator

 Those who wanted to donate to the party, Prashant also prevented those people from donating

 About two weeks before the election, when Ashish Khaitan called Prashant to urge the leadership of the Delhi Dialogue on the issue of Lokpal and Swaraj, Prashant told Khaitan that campaigning for the party was far from over, They want to defeat Delhi's election party
 unhone kaha ki unki koshish yah he ki party 20-22 siton se zyada na paae, party haaregi tabhi netritv parivartan sambhav hoga
