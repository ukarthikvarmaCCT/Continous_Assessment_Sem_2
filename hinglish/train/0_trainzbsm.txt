 Taking a dig at the Yogi government over the EPF scam, Lallu said that the hypocrisy of the BJP government claiming zero tolerance against corruption has been exposed
 dchaefeel company main bijli karmchaariyon ke 2600 karod rupee ke ipief ko fansaakar luutane kaa kaam kiya gaya
 He said that the EPF scam was uncovered in July, but the government had not taken any action

 Congress leader Lallu said that CM Yogi Adityanath should explain why so much money was invested in the private company without the approval of the cabinet? UP Congress Chief Lallune raised the question as to what the chairman, minister and MD of the whole matter Is the role? Is it enough to suspend the Chief Engineer and send him to jail in this entire case? He also sought the resignation of the Energy Minister of the state Shrikant Sharma
 saath hi kaha ki is maamle main urja vibhaag ke sheersh adhikariyon ke khilaaf bhi exiaar darj honi chahie

 On October 24, the petition filed in the court seeking a Supreme Court monitoring of the deal said Prime Minister Narendra Modi, during his visit to France in April 2015, bypassing the rules, announced that he would ship from France Are buying iske baad sitambar, 2016 main france ke saath antar-sarkari samjhauta (ijie) kiya gaya

" agar is aadhaar par jaanch hogi to iskaa supreme court kii nishpakshta par bura asar padegaa
 Earlier, on October 31, the court said that it would not consider the suitability and utility of these aircraft and was only interested in issues related to the process and offsets
 sarkaar ko tab badi raahat mili jab court ne kaha ki vah vimaanon kii keemat kaa khulaasa nahin karne ja rahaa he

 This match night 8 in Hyderabad

 Both teams have 10 points from 11 matches and their chances of winning on Monday will increase their chances of a place in the playoffs
 sunrisers hyderabad ke liye yah satr kaa antim muqabla hoga, jisamen unhen ipel ke is 12wein sanskaran main ab tab sabase adhik ran banane vaale david warner kii sevaayen milengi
 After this match, Warner will return to Australia to prepare for the World Cup

 Johnny Bairstow (445) has already returned to England, leaving the team missing the opening pair for the final two matches
 maujuuda satr main team ne paanch maichon main jeet darj kii he or paanchon main warner-beresto kii jodi ne shandaar bhoomika nibhaai he
 Apart from the poor performance of the middle-order batsmen, poor bowling in the final overs is responsible for his defeat
 ravichandran aswin kii aguwai main kings ilevan punjab kii koshish match ke ahm maukon ko apane paksh main karne kii hogi
 How the Sunrisers middle-order batsmen deal with the challenge of Ashwin and fast bowler Mohammed Shami, remains to be seen
 manish pandey kii ek ardhashtakeey pari ko chhod team kii ore se kisi ne madhyakram main yaadgaar pari nahin kheli
 Sunrisers, who were out for most of the match due to injury, would like the best from Hyderabad captain Kane Williamson Warner to make it easier to reach the playoffs
 sunrisers kii tarah kings ilevan punjab bhi salaami ballebaajon par kaaphi nirbhar he
 Chris Gayle (444 runs) and Lokesh Rahul (441 runs) are in fine rhythm, while Mayank Agarwal (262 runs) has also played some good innings
 sitambar 2013 main narendra modi ko bijepi kaa piem ummidavaar banaae jane par endie ko sabase bada siyaasi jhatka dene vaale nitish kumaar aakhirkaar shanivaar ko phir endie ke ho gaye
 Nitish Kumar announced to rejoin NDA after 4 years
 patna main party kii rashtriya kaaryakari parishad kii baithak bulaakar nitish ne yah elaan kiya
 However, Sharad Yadav is on a different path from Nitish
 sharad ke samarthakon ne nitish ke ghar ke baahar pradarshan kiya or patna main hi alag meeting kar sharad gut ne khud ko asli party bataaya or kaha ki mahagathbandhan abhi bhi jari he
 BJP is seeing a future in Nitish Nitish Kumar has been with NDA for the last 13 years
 atal sarkaar main ve mantri the, lekin sitambar 2013 main unhone modi ko bijepi kii kaman milane ko secular nitiyon ke khilaaf bataate hue endie chodi thi
 Then a grand alliance was formed in Bihar and now they became part of NDA by accusing the Lalu family of corruption
 haal tak jediu nitish ko modi ke khilaaf sabase vishwasaneey cheharaa bataa rahi thi
 There was also speculation about making him the PM candidate in the 2019 elections, but there was little scope for consent from the Congress
 phir sonia gandhi se mulaakaat main nitish ne saaf kar diya ki ve piem pad kii res main nahin hai, lekin pichley maheene teji se badale ghatnakram main nitish ne vipaksh kaa saath chhod diya or ab endie kaa hissaa bhi ban gaye
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, NDA won 33 out of 40 seats in Bihar
 nitish kii party ko sirf do siten mili thim
 The BJP would like to retain this record of victory in Bihar with Nitish in 2019
 isliye nitish kaa saath uske mishan 2019 ke liye kaaphi ahm he
 Let it also be: there is no one like Modi in Indian politics, what will be the impact of the survey figures on bjp's Mission 2019? Nitish's coming into this camp for shah-modi's duo engaged in ensuring Modi's second innings i
e
 Mission 2019 It is a great relief
 bijepi ko aisa ummid he ki nitish kumaar kaa unke saath aana vipaksh ke rashtriya mahagathbandhan ke liye bada jhatka sabit honge
 The BJP has got a big win in UP recently, but the defeat in Bihar in the 2015 elections could have been a big threat to the future elections for the BJP
 vipakshi dal bijepi ko gherne ke liye bihar ke mahagathbandhan ke formule or bihar kii haar kaa lagaataar udhaaharan dekar ekajutata kii koshishon main lage the
 Whatever be the method, but BJP as Nitish got a big opportunity to make a dent in the opposition camp and it can act as a booster for Shah's strategy
 nae saathiyon par najaranitish ke aane ke baad ab bijepi kii nigaah gathbandhan ke nae saathiyon ko jodakar un kshetron main paith banane kii hogi, jahaan bijepi abhi kam asardaar rahi he
 By bringing both AIADMK factions together in Tamil Nadu, BJP is negotiating for entry into the politics of this largest state of the South

 During the presidential election, all the 6 TMC mlas in Tripura joined the BJP camp
 yahaan bhi ab party kii ummiden badi hai
 The BJP will now work towards adding new allies in other states of the Northeast - Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya to the south - Kerala, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu
 mahagathbandhan kaa bhavishyanithish ke jane se bhale hi vipakshi dal kah rahe hon ki koi asar nahin padegaa, lekin vipaksh kii ore se rashtriya mahagathbandhan banane kaa sapana jarur tuutegaa
 Sharad Yadav, who had gone on a rebellion with Nitish, called a meeting of 17 parties in Delhi on Thursday, in which leaders of various parties including Rahul Gandhi, Sitaram Yechury also attended

 Making lovely memories together # bharattakthani # dimitris # roshmila # mumbaimirror # greece # santorinia post shared by Esha Deol (@imeshadeol) on Jul 17, 2017 at 12:54am PDTA post shared by Esha Deol (@imeshadeol) on Jul 9, 2017 at 11:34pm PDT The perception about the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) has been made that it is a mysterious, secret and underground organization, which the outside world knows little about
 yah dharna sanghathan ke apane vyavhaar or kaaryakalapon par pardaa daale rakhane se bhi majubat hoti ai he
 Interestingly, the RSS is one of the few organizations in India that was founded before independence
 ab jabaki chah saal baad (sangh kii sthapana 27 sitambar, 1925 ko nagpur main vijayadashami ke din hui thi) sangh kii sthapana ke sau varsh puure hone ja rahe hai, sangh vah sab kar rahaa he, jisase apane bare main bani kuch galat dharanaon ko thik kar sake
 This is the first time that a senior RSS pracharak has tried to put forth through a book the inner workings of the Sangh, its ideology, its vision towards India and its thinking on various subjects
 lambey samay se sangh ke chaatr sanghathan akhil bhartiya vidhyaarthee parishad (ABVP) main sanghathan mahasachiv kii mahatvapurn jimmedaari nibhaa rahe sunil ambekar kii pustak – 'da RSS rodmaps for da twanti first centuri' - un tamaam vishyon par sangh kii raay spasht karne kaa prayaas karti he, jinhen lekar RSS ko kathghare main khadaa kiya jaataa rahaa he
 Ambedkar writes that the Sangh's thinking in the hindu-muslim context has been clear from the beginning
 sangh maanata he ki ekan sat, wipro: bahudhaa vadanti
 Therefore, discrimination cannot be done only because the method of worship is different
 ambekar ke mutabik yah soch sangh or hindu mahasabha ke bich buniyadi antar tha
 The Hindu Mahasabha thought that representation should be based on religion, whereas the Sangh believed that India, irrespective of religion, creed or faith, belongs to all those who were born and lived here
 sangh saajha saanskrithik viraasat kii baat karata he
 For this Ambedkar quotes India's first Prime Minister Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, who said at the convocation of Aligarh Muslim University on 24 January 1948 - "you are Muslim and i am Hindu
 
 
 ham vibhinn dharmon main aasthaa rakh sakate hai yaa phir kisi main nahin
 
 
 But our cultural heritage is shared
 
 
 itihaas hamen saath rakhata he, to phir vartmaan yaa bhavishya alag kyon karen
 
 
 ? ”ambedkar writes that the Sangh was against partition on religious grounds of India and that is why, when Gandhiji approved the partition, the Sangh condemned this decision
 ambekar ke mutabik, bharat ke vibhaajan ke liye mukhya rup se muslim lig jimmedaar thi
 Muslims living in India are in a better position than Muslims living in any other country
 unhen adhik loktantric swatantraaa he
 There are various religions of Islam in India, which can be worshiped boldly according to their faith, which is not possible even in Islamic countries
 ambekar yah bhi likhte hai ki sangh kii sabhi shakhaon main sabase mahatvapurn paath padhaayaa jaataa he ki bharat ek hindu raashtra he
 It is further written that the Hindu nation is not anti-muslim
 pustak kahati he ki hindutv kii avadharana hindu raashtra se judi he
 Many people see it through the prism of Muslim opposition, which is completely wrong
 pustak main sangh pramukh (sarasanghachaalak) mohan bhagwat ke hawaale se kaha gaya he ki "hamaara desh hindu raashtra he, lekin iskaa yah matlab nahin ki isamen musalmaan shaamil nahin hai
 
 
 The day it will be said that Muslims do not need, then the existence of Hindutva will disappear
 
 
 "yah pustak un aaropon kaa bhi khandan karti he ki sangh ne swatantraaa andolan main hissaa nahin liya tha
 Ambekar writes that the volunteers took part in the 'quit India Movement' led by Gandhiji
 british record ke anusaar, nagpur ke nazadik asti naamak jagah par angrejon ne aath swatantraaa senaniyon ko faansee par latakaaya tha, jinamein se do sangh ke swayamsevak the
 According to Ambekar, it is true that women are not part of the shakha, but many women are active in RSS
 sangh kii sthapana ke samay se hi mahilaon ke liye rashtriya sevika samiti kaa gathan hua tha, jiske kaarykram, gatividhiyaan or vibhaag ityadi sangh kii tarah hi hai
 Women are playing an equal role in Sangh activities across the country
 bhashaa ke prashn par bhi is pustak main sangh kii raay spasht kii gai he
 The book says that Sanskrit should be taught from the beginning
 bachche apni maatrubhaasha main padhein or aadhunik gyaan arjeet karen
 The Sangh believes that Sanskrit and all Indian languages should be promoted to make India a world teacher
 sangh maanata he ki bhashaa ke aadhaar par bhedbhaav nahin hona chahie or sabhi bhashaaon kaa samaan rup se vikaas hona chahie
 The book about Jammu and Kashmir states that there are four major works left in the coming days - first, to restore the dignity and property of the displaced Kashmiri Pandits; Second, the withdrawal of Kashmir under Pakistani occupation; Third, eliminate terrorism and fourth, develop the state
 sangh liv-in relationships (live-in Relationship) ko sahi nahin maanata
 The book notes that such relationships are negative role models for society
 aise desh, jahaan majboot paariwarik mulya nahin hai, vahaan liv-in relationships ko mana ja saktaa he, lekin bharat main jahaan puri tarah se sakriy paariwarik vyavastha he, aise sambandhon kii zarurat nahin he
 The Sangh believes that there should not be conflict over inter-caste marriages
 agar ladkaa or ladki shaadi karne par ade hai, to aise main mata-pita ko unhen apana aashirwad de dena chahie
 Regarding homosexual relations, the book makes it clear that senior union official Dattatreya Hosbole had said that homosexuality should not be considered a crime
 baad main unhone ge marij par kaha tha ki ise manyata nahin milani chahie, kyonki isse samalangikta ko vaidhaniktaa milti he
 However, being inclusive is a major concern
 pustak sanghapramukh mohan bhagwat ke hawaale se kahati he ki har vyakti samaaj kaa hissaa he
 Society is changing and we should give space to everyone, so that they do not feel isolated
 ambekar likhte hai ki sangh dalgat raajnneeti main hissaa nahin letaa, lekin iskaa matlab yah nahin ki sangh gaiyr-raajnneetik he
 The Sangh believes that politics should be nationalist and political work should be in line with Indian culture
 sangh bhartiya janata party (BJP) ke kaam main dakhal nahin detaa
 If feedback is taken from the union at the time of ticket distribution, the union gives feedback
 isse aage chunaav sambandhi nirnyon main sangh kaa dakhal nahin he
 It does not decide the electoral strategy, which is the work of the political party
 kisi bhi BJP sarkaar main badi sankhya main swayamsevak hote hai, iskaa yah matlab nahin ki sangh rozmarra ke kaam main dakhsandaazi karata he
 They are free to work
 'sangh kaa remote control' jaisi koi chiz nahin he
 The Union has no way of control
 sarkaar samvidhan ke daayre main kaam karti he
 It follows the rules and traditions
 yah sansad ke zariye janata ke prati javabdeh he
 This book of Sunil Ambekar will be released on 1 October in Sangh Pramukh Mohan Bhagwat Delhi

 indrani mukherjee ne farvari 2018 main court main bayaan diya tha, yah ladi (indrani mukherjee) june 2019 main sarkari gavaah ban gayi

 kya sarkari gavaah bananaa koi saboot he? kya uske aadhaar par giraftaar kar sakate hai?jaj ne poocha, chidambaram ko saman kab jari kiya gaya tha? singhvi ne kaha, june 2018 main
 You can't find the answer you want to hear

 Singhvi said that Chidambaram would not answer what the CBI wants to hear
 singhvi ne is bahes main aage kaha, mehta ne remand to maangi he par koi aarope in par nahin lagaaya he
 What are the allegations? The entire CBI approach is wrong in this case
 chidambaram se koi tripal risk nahin, flite risk, matlab bhaagane kaa, gavaahon ko prabhavit karne kaa or saboot mitaane kaa
 This is not a strong case for custody

 Chidambaram tried to say something on this, but the CBI lawyer stopped
 mehta ne kaha ki 2 vakil pehle hi court main bahes kar rahe hai
 On behalf of the CBI, Tusshar Mehta said, it takes time till a conclusion is reached in the investigation of serious fraud

 Soon after, Chidambaram got relief from the High Court

 The High Court also believed that it was not worth granting bail
 ham bina castodial interogeshan ke sachai tak nahin pahunch sakate
 We cannot tell about the investigation in public
 chidambaram apana paksh rakhana chaahate the, lekin sibiai ne virodh kiya or kaha, ye galat parampara hogi
 Chidambaram said, "I did not answer any question nor did i take money from CBI on 6 June 2018
 mere bete kaa videsh main acount he uski jaankaree maine sibiai ko de di he
 i do not have an account abroad

 All the nine districts of Kanpur zone will now have preventive policing, for this, Google is being resorted to
 iske tahat prayek jile ke sabhi police steshnon main pichley 10 saalon main hone vaale aparaadhon kaa byora or itihaas google main darj kiya jaayegaa or sarvaadhik aparaadh hone vaale kshetron ko chinhit karke vahaan par police picket tainaat kiye jaayenge taaki apradhi aparaadh karke bhaag na saken yaa phir vah aparaadh karne se pehle hi police ke hathe chadh jaayen
 With the help of Google, the Preventive Police Service will start in the first week of July next month in all the 176 police stations of Kanpur zone, Kanpur city, Kannauj, Kanpur Dehat, Farrukhabad, Jhansi, Lalitpur, Mainpuri, Jalaun and Etawah
 iske liye prayek thane ke ek ek yuva pulicekarmi ko is bare main training dene kaa kaarykram shuru ho chukaa he
 Inspector General of Police of Kanpur Zone (IG Police) Ashutosh Pandey told in a special conversation with the language that till now our police does 'reacting policing' in which after any crime or incident happens, the police reach the spot and investigating the case, the criminals Reaches lekin agra ke baad ham kanpur jone ke sabhi nau jilo main priventive pulising kii shuruuaat karne ja rahe hai taaki aparaadh se pehle yaa aparaadh karne ke baad apradhi police kii girafat main ho
 Pandey was earlier posted in Agra and supervised the work of preventive policing there
 pandey ke anusaar iske tahat hamane sabhi jilo ke police steshnon se sabase zyada aparaadh kiye jane vaale sthanon kaa puraa byora mangava liya he
 For example, in one place in Kanpur's Civil Lines area, in the last ten years, the maximum number of chain robberies have occurred, then we will put all this data in a special website of Google whose password will only be with the officers and police officers
 isi tarah marpet, dakaiti, chori, lut, sampradayik tanaav kii ghatnaayen pichley das saalon main kab kab kahaan kahaan hui he yah sab google map main padaa hoga
 Now the officer will go through the Google map and enter the password, and when the history of that district is investigated, then with one click, the complete details of where the most crime incidents occur in the entire district will be on his computer screen
 unhone bataaya ki google map par daale gayi data main aparaadh kya tha, kisne kiya tha, kab kiya tha tathaa vartmaan samay me us maamle kii sthiti kya he apradhi koun the or kya ve pakade gayi the yaa abhi tak faraar hai yah sari jaankaree uplabdh hogi
 After putting the name of a city on Google map, the details of crimes will come out automatically according to the area in the city and it will be known that in which area the crime is going on more
 aiji pandey ne bataaya ki phir ham jahaan aparaadh zyada ho rahaa he vahaan vahaan par police kii tukadiyaan or picket tainaat karenge taaki aparaadh se pehle hi apradhi police kii girafat main aa jaye or agar kisi kaaran aparaadh ho bhi gaya to apradhi turant police kii girafat main aa jaayen
 Pandey said that since the introduction of this preventive policing system in Agra, there was a significant reduction in the maximum number of silver loot incidents as we had identified the places where most silver loot incidents were done using Google map
 Police used to be stationed at those places so that criminals would either get caught earlier or immediately loot the police after the robbery
 kanpur jone ke sabhi nau jilon ke 176 police steshnon ke pulicekarmiyon kii training kaa kaam shuru ho gaya he or sabhi jilon ke aparaadhon kii data feeding bhi shuru ho gayi he
 Once the data feeding is completed, the policemen who are trained in this will feed the daily crimes of their respective police stations to the police officers of the entire zone
 yah google par aadhaarit priventive pulising vyavastha jone ke sabhi nau jilon main agle maah july ke pratham saptaah main shuru kiye jane kii koshish he

 unhone kaha ki pehle jab jidipi kii nai shrinkhalaa ke liye 2011-12 ko aadhaar varsh banaaya gaya tha, tab sarkaar ne 2009-10 par bhi vichaar kiya tha
 But economists believed that 2009–10 was not a good year globally and domestically, so 2011–12 was made the base year of the new series of GDP
 ek baar parinaam aa jane ke baad, aadhaar varsh ko badalane kaa prastaav sambandhit samitiyon ke samaksh rakhaa jayega
 On a question about the economic recovery, Pravin Srivastava said that it is too early to comment now, as the situation will be clear only after the IIP, CPI and WPI data are released in the first fortnight (two weeks) of November

 Most people resolve before starting any auspicious work and remember Ganesha
 kuch log shubharambh karte samay sarvapratham shriganeshy nam: likhte hai
 Apart from this, it is also custom that Sri Ganesh is worshiped before all the deities
 is rivaaj ke bare main to adhiktar log jaanate hai, lekin ye bahut kam log jaanate hai ki sabase pehleganeshjiki hi puja kyon kii jaati he
 So let us tell you why Ganesha is worshiped first
 
 
 darasal, kisi puja, aradhana, anushthan va kaary main koi vighn-baadha na aae, isliye sarvapratham ganesh-puja karke uski krupa praapt kii jaati he
 There is also a legend behind this
 ek baar samast devataaon main is baat par vivaad utpann hua ki dharti par kis devtaa kii puja samast devganon se pehle ho
 All the gods started to tell themselves the best
 tab naarad ji ne is sthiti ko dekhte hue sabhi devganon kobhagwan shiv kii sharanmen jane va unase is prashn kaa uttar bataane kii salaah di
 When all the gods approached near Lord Shiva, seeing this quarrel between them, Lord Shiva conceived a plan to resolve it
 unhone ek pratiyogita yojit kii
 All the gods were asked to sit in their respective vehicles and go around this whole universe
 is pratiyogita main jo bhi sarvapratham brahmand kii parikrama kar unke paas pahonchega, vahi sarvapratham poojaneey mana jayega
 All the gods set out for their circumambulation with their vehicles
 ganesh ji bhi isi pratiyogita kaa hissaa the
 However, Ganesha, like the other gods, instead of orbiting the universe, completed seven rounds of his parents shiva-parvati and stood with folded hands in front of him
 jab samast devtaa apni apni parikrama karke laute tababhagwan shivane shri ganesh ko pratiyogita kaa vijayi ghoshit kar diya
 All the gods were astonished to hear this decision and Shiva began to ask God the reason for it
 tabashiwajine unhen bataaya ki mata-pita ko samast brahmand evam samast lok main sarvocch sthaan diya gaya he, jo devataaon va samast sristi se bhi ucch maane gaye hai
 Then all the gods, Lord Shiva agreed with this decision
 tabhi se ganesh ji ko sarvapratham poojya mana jane laga
 This is the reason that Lord Ganesha started worshiping among the gods first due to the use of his sharp intellect
 tab se aaj tak prayek shubh kaary yaa utsav se purv ganesh vandan ko shubh mana gaya he
 Worshiping Lord Ganesha is going to remove all sorrows and bring prosperity
 atah sabhi bhakton ko puri shraddha va aasthaa seganesh jika pujan har shubh kaary se purv karnaa chahie
 So for this reason every auspicious work is done by worshiping Kashi Ganesha, an antidote of Ganesha

 By the way, there are some basic rules of any fast, such as not to be angry, not to do evil to anyone, not to expel the mouth etc
 thik isi tarah karvaa chouth ke vrath ke din bhi yah niyam lagu hota he
 If you are fasting, then control your senses
 kehete hai ki agar is din krodh kiya jaae to vrath kaa purna fal nahin miltaa he

 vrath kii shuruyaat sargi khaakar karen
 Sargi should be eaten before sunrise
 jis vakt aap sargi khaaen us vakt dakshin purv disha kii ore mukh kar ke hi baithen
 3
 karvaa chouth par din bhar nirjala vrath rakhaa jaataa he
 That is, drinking water apart from food and water is also prohibited
 suhaagin mahilaayein chand ko arghya dene ke baad pati ke haathon pani pikar vrath todatii hai
 At the same time, virgin girls can drink water after visiting the stars
 vaise to garbhvatee or biimaar mahilaon ko karvaa chouth kaa vrath nahin karnaa chahie
 But many pregnant women can also observe this fast by drinking fruit and water

 is din suhaag ke rang jaise ki laal, pile or hare rang kii sari, salwar suut or lahange kaa sarvaadhik chalan he
 Wearing black and white clothes should be avoided on this day

 Arghya is considered to be very important and auspicious on the fast of Karva Chauth
 is din mahilaayein sabase pehle chalni par deepak rakhti hai
 After this, before the sieve, she sees Chand and then her husband
 iske baad chand ko arghya diya jaataa he
 Finally women open their fast by drinking water from husband's hand and eating sweets
 6
 After this, offer food to God and then sit with your husband and have your meal
 saath hi yah pati-patni donon ke liye jaruri he ki ve sirf karvaa chouth ke din hi nahin balki hameshaa ek-duusare kaa sammaan karen taaki unka rishta hamesh pyaar kii door se bandhaa rahe

 One person was shot in Delhi's Civil Line area
 isse vah ghayal ho gaya
 He is hospitalized
 hamale kii vajah aapasi ranjish hone kaa shaq he
 In Delhi's Civil Line this morning a man named Rahul was shot from outside the gym
 goli rahul kii qamar main lagi jise paas ke aspataal main bhartee karaayaa gaya he
 Rahul is out of danger
 rahul naveen shahdara kaa rahane vaala he or ghar ke saamaan kaa distributor he
 Rahul used to sit in his brother-in-law's gym in the civil line in the morning
 hamale ke peeche aapasi ranjish lag rahi he
 Police is searching for the accused according to CCTV
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne srinagar main kaha, "30 saal main pehali baar modi sarkaar kaa kamaal dekhie ki sena ne pehali baar press conference karke kaha ki jo noujvaan maare gaye, usamen sena kii galati thi
 The Inquiry Commission was set up and cases were filed on those who fired
 yah mere nek iraadon kaa saboot he
 
 
 " khaas baat yah he ki piem ne yah baat chunavi bhaashan ke dauraan kahi
 
 
 Not in a closed room or a press conference
 
 
 yah shaayad pehla mauka tha, jab kisi pradhanmantri ne fouj ko kashmir kii chunavi raajnneeti main ghasita ho
 The question arises as to how far the Prime Minister is referring to the army for mere electoral gains
 
 
 ? vah bhi kashmir jaisi samvedansheel jagah par
 
 
 If the Prime Minister here wants to show that he has apologized for killing innocents for the first time in 30 years at his behest, then he is wrong
 jammu-kashmir main sena ke pehle army commander rahen leftinent general eches panaag kehete hai ki 2007-08 main unke kaarykaal ke dauraan bhi aisi galtiyaan hui thim to unhone avam se maaphi maangane main koi deree nahin kii thi
 Now that the army has become an electoral issue in Kashmir, questions are also arising as to why the immediate investigation was completed within 20 days on the two deaths in Budgam, whereas in the completion of such investigation, two or three It takes months
 or to or, chunaav ke dauraan hi machchhal encounter maamle main paanch phogiyon ko doshi qaraar dene kaa faisla kyon saamne aayaa
 Discussions about the timing of these two are in full swing, which are also raising many questions
 kya aanan-fanan ab sena kii aisi karrwai raajnneeti se prerit to nahin he
 
 
 The sainya maamalon ke kanoonee jaankaar major eses pandey kehete hai ki sena main amunan aisi karrwai chupchaap hoti he or baahar koi iske bare main charchaa nahin karata, to phir kyon is maamle main khabaron ko raajnneetik rang diya ja rahaa he, or kaise ye khabaren li ho rahi hai
 
 
 The itnaa hi nahin, ab to sena ke sheersh se lekar neeche tak ke afasar koi bhi karrwai karne se pehle 10 baar sochenge ki unke kaam par sidhe pradhanmantri kii nazar he
 Maybe, they could not do their work honestly as before, because earlier they used to take decisions based on the rules of the army and the situation on the ground, but now they will also decide after thinking something else, and what will be the result of it Time will come only
 haalanki soshal cites par yah baat jor-shor se chal rahi he ki uri main jo kuch hua, vah maujuuda nardarn army commander leftinent general dies hooda ke badgaam main sena kii karrwai par sena kii galati maan lene kaa nateeja he
 It is being said that when the terrorists came near Uri's sentry post, the jawan had suspected them, but could not fire directly on them and it cost eight soldiers of the army to die
 gauratlab he ki badgaam main us vakt sena ne kaha tha ki uske do santari post par logon ko roka gaya tha, lekin ve nahin ruke or un par goli chalaai gai, jisase do logon kii maut ho gai
 By the way, when the army people were talked about it, they said that Narendra Modi had not only gone to Jammu and Kashmir as the leader of the BJP, but before that he is the Prime Minister of the country
 unase sab logon kii tarah sena kii bhi khaas ummiden hai
 The expectations are not only to restore the honor and honor of the army, but also to raise its spirits so that the army can face every kind of challenge when the time comes
 lekin agar pradhanmantri aise sena kaa hausala badhayenge, to uskaa nateeja kya hoga, yah kehane kii zarurat nahin he
 How poor the government's attitude towards security can be gauged from the fact that the country's largest paramilitary force CRPF is still devoid of the chief, the same situation is with the SPG responsible for the Prime Minister's security
 sarkaar or sarkari mashinari kii ore se har kshetra main mahilaon kii bhagidaari badhaane ke prayaas jari hai

 lekin india today kii special investegative team ne apni jaanch main khud ko dharmarth bataane vaale is sanghathan ke asli chehre ko benakaab kar diya he
 India Today under-cover reporters have captured such revelations from the mouths of PFI top officials on hidden cameras

 es
 On Monday called all such allegations baseless
 jainba ne un aaropon kaa hawala die jane par ye baat kahi ki ve gaiyr muslim mahilaon ko dharm parivartan ke liye 'taiyaar' karti hai
 Zainaba is suspected of playing an important role in the case of Kerala, which is being described as the state's own love jihad case
 yani hadiya kii muslim yuvak shafin jahaan se shaadi kaa maamla
 Hadiya's first name was Akhila Ashokan
 is saal may main rajya hoicourt ne is shaadi ko radd kar diya tha
 In fact, the woman's father challenged the marriage in the High Court, saying that it is an act of forced conversion for terrorist recruitment
 ab hadiya or shafin jahaan kii apil supreme court main vichaaradhin he
 Zainba said on Monday, "I had contacted Hadiya only when she came for admission in Sathya Sarani (a partner organization of PFI)
 hakeekat main usne islam dharm do saal pehle hi apana liya tha
 It adopted Islam in 2013
 " jainba ne jor de kar kaha ki ye lav jihad nahin balki arenjd marij he
 But before Zainba openly rejected the allegations on Monday for this high profile case, before Zainba's revelations of black exploits of PFI, India Today under-cover reporters were caught on hidden cameras
 ol india muslim personal lau board kii sadsy jainba ko ye kehete hue chupe camere par kaid kiya gaya ki kis tarah PFI or iskaa sahyogi sanghathan satya sarani kerala ke manjeri main bade paimaane par dharm parivartan main laga he
 Zainaba said, "that is our institution
 
 
 beete 10 saal main ab tak kareeb 5,000 logon ko islam kabool karaayaa ja chukaa he
 "zainaba considered these people to be both Hindus and Christians
 kerala main bhaavnaatmak mudda maane jane vaale dharm parivartan par arunachal pradesh, himachal pradesh, gujarat, madhya pradesh or odisha main pratibandh he agar ise jabaran yaa pralobhan dekar karaayaa jaataa he
 Recently, the Jharkhand Legislative Assembly has also passed anti-conversion bill
 malappuram main apane ghar par pati ali ke saath baithi jainba ne under cover reporters ke saamne khul kar bataaya ki kis tarah kuch gaiyr muslim mahilaon ko dharm parivartan kara islam kabool karaane main unki bhoomika rahi
 However, the husband and wife did not say anything separately on the matter related to Hadiya
 ali ne kaha, "hamaare paas ek skool teacher he, wo maths main emessi or bied he
 "zainaba added," she is now holding Islam
 usne chaar saal pehle dharm parivartan kiya
 "under cover reporter-" Did you convert her? "pfi's female leader said," Yes, four years ago
 "jainba ne khulaasa kiya, "dharm parivartan se pehle uskaa naam shubha tha, ab wo fatima he
 "under Cover Reporter-" How many non-muslims have you converted? "jainba -" Many are "jainba also revealed the complete modalities of conversion
 jainba ne kaha ki dharm parivartan ke centre dharmarth yaa shaikshanik sansthaanon kaa chola pahan kar chalaae jate hai jisase ki kisi virodh kii sambhaavna ko khatm kiya ja sake
 Zainaba said, "we do not have to officially declare it a religious conversion center
 ye ek shaikshanik santhaan he
 "zainaba conceded," Much preparation is done for all this, resources are needed
 hamen pehle bharosa bananaa hota he
 "zainba said that such secret centers need at least 15 members to register as trusts
 vistaar se bataate hue jainba ne kaha, "baad main ham centre ke parisar ke liye jagah chunate hai
 The campus should have all facilities
 jaise ki namaaj ke liye masjid, rahane kii jagah, sabhi suvidhaon vaala institute jaise ki yah (satya sarani)
 Then after that it is registered with the government like the Societies Registration Act
 "jainba ne aage ye bhi bataaya ki kaise pfixarma parivartanakaraane ke baad naam badalawaane ke praaanpatron ko baahar se banwaaya jaataa he
 Zainaba said, “there are two ways

 amritsar rail haadase ke baad se railway prashasan lagaataar apni jimmedaari se pallaa jhaad rahaa he
 Now another information which has put a question mark on the claims of Railways has come out
 darasal, amritsar train haadase ko lekar railway ne safai dete hue kaha tha ki jis jagah par dmyu kii vajah se rail haadasa hua, vahaan par patariyon main ghumaav he
 So the loco pilot from far away could not understand that people are on track
 'ajtak' ke haath aisi jaankaree lagi he, jo na sirf railway ke bayaan ke ulat he, balki uske daavon par bhi sawaal khadey karti he
 The jalandhar-amritsar rail track on both sides of the Joda Gate is quite straightforward and the biggest thing is that the loco pilot has a six by six eye
 aise main trek par jamaa logon ko na dekh paane kii baat apane aap main achraj main daalane vaali he
 The railway gate has no fencing near the place where the incident happened
 haalanki ravan dahan ke kaarykram sthal ke paas railway kii oonchi-oonchi diwaar hai
 The organizers of the Vijayadashami fair here arranged seating of people by cutting weeds and trees on the railway ground across the fair ground as well as on the wall adjacent to the rail tracks
 sthaneey logon kaa kahana tha ki elidi kaa munh patari kii taraf kar diya gaya tha, taaki log ravan dahan kaa anand uthaa saken
 When this complete arrangement was being made, where was the RPF responsible for the safety of railway tracks and what was their intelligence unit doing? While the program was taking place, were the railway officials and security personnel asleep? Now the railway is claiming that people had come on the track unauthorizedly
 lihaaja uski koi jimmedaari nahin banati he
 Along with this, the railway also says that the place of organizing the fair of Vijayadashami also does not come under them
 lihaaja unase parmishan kii bhi jarurat nahin thi
 What did the Chairman of the Railway Board say? On Friday, the DMU train near the Joda Gate in Amritsar went out after crushing the crowd of hundreds of people gathered for the burning
 iske baad rail mantralay kaa kahana tha ki train ke loko payalat kii koi galati nahin he or isaki siares jaanch kii jarurat nahin he
 According to Railway Board Chairman Ashwani Lohani, there is no fault of the loco pilot in this accident
 kul milakar railway kaa kahana he ki jahaan par yah haadasa hua vah jagah railway ke kanoon ke mutabik logon ke ikattha hone ke liye nahin he
 When people gather at such a place, it is considered an illegal entry
 unhone kaha ki rail sangraksha ayog nagar vimaanan mantralay ke prashasnic niyantran main kaam karata he or sabhi rail durghatnaon kii anivaary jaanch karata he
 This was an incident in which people made unauthorized entry on the railway track and it is not a rail accident
 rail rajya mantri manoj sinhane kya kaha tha?iske alaava rail rajya mantri manoj sinha ne ghatnasthal kaa daura karne ke baad kaha tha ki ghatana ke vakt shaam ho chuki thi or vahaan ki patari bhi ghumaavdaar thi, jiske chalate driver ko aage nahin dikhaai padaa hoga
 When asked about the speed of the train, he said that trains run at the same speed
 getman ke khilaaf karrwai karne ke sawaal par unhone kaha tha ki jis jagah par ravan kaa putala jalaayaa ja rahaa tha, vahaan se rail phatak 300 meter dur he
 On the question of investigation of the case, Sinha said that what should we inquire about
 
 
 ? jab unase poocha gaya ki kya driver kisi bhi tarah train nahin roak saktaa tha
 On this, the minister said that the program was being held 70 meters away from the track, besides there was a light bend, then how could the driver see it? How did the accident happen? Let me tell you that on Friday evening, the couple of the gate located in the wide market of Amritsar People were present on the railway track
 patariyon se mahaj 200 foot kii duuri par putala jalaayaa ja rahaa tha
 Meanwhile, the DMU train going from Jalandhar to Amritsar passed from there and crushed the people present on the track
 iske baad chaaro ore laashen bich gayi
 59 people have died in this accident, while 57 people are injured

 Political and anti-political opponents, be it UP Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav or Tripura Chief Minister Manik Sarkar, all have met PM Modi
 mana ja rahaa he ki mamata banerjee somvaar ko apane saansadon ke saath pradhanmantri se milengi
 The Prime Minister has made sharp attacks on the opposition in his recent speeches in Parliament, but has been soft on the TMC
 ek varisht tiemasi netaa ne kaha, 'pichley dinon tiemasi or sipiem ne rajyasabha main kai muddon par talmail kiya or sarkaar ke khilaaf milakar ranneeti banaai
 The Prime Minister also wants to break this unity within Parliament
 raashtrapati ke abhibhaashan par jawaab ke dauraan isiilie pradhanmantri sipiem par hamale kar rahe the lekin hamaari party par unhone hamalaa nahin kiya
 ' agle saal hone vaale vidhansabha chunaavon ko dekhte hue bijepi ke liye bengal kaaphi ahm he
 Right now she has only one MLA here, but she is trying to increase her number
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main bijepi ne do sansadeey siton par jeet hasil kii or uske hausale buland hai
 On the other hand, TMC is hoping that Mamata Banerjee will be able to get some relief in meeting the Prime Minister in the interest of the state
 vahiin pradhanmantri raajnneetik rup se khud par kiye ja rahe hamalon ko kund karne kii koshish kar sakate hai
 But will it be possible for the central government to forgive the debt of two lakh crores
 jaankaar kehete hai ki centre sarkaar kisi bhi haal main bengal ko ye raahat nahin de sakati to kya aise main mamata ki ye mulaakaat nae takaraav kii ibaarat likhegi

 ) The political battle of Lok Sabha elections 2019 has reached Purvanchal
 sabaki nigahen ek ore piem modi ke sansadeey seat varanasi to duusari taraf purv mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav kii seat azamgarh par lagi he
 BJP has made the contest interesting by putting Bhojpuri film star Dinesh Lal Yadav aka 'nirhua' against Akhilesh
 aise main azamgarh kaa puraa siyaasi sangram yadav samudaay ke netaa or abhinayta ke bich simat gaya he
 In such a situation, the big question is, how will Yadav and Muslim equation in this seat spoil Akhilesh's political arithmetic with his filmy charisma? Have entered the electoral arena
 haalanki 2014 main unke pita mulaayam singh yadav bhi utre the, lekin is mansoobon par wo safal nahin ho sake the
 This time, Akhilesh has chosen Azamgarh to fight the war with the help of elephant
 basapa se gathbandhan ke chalate yahaan kii siyaasi phija bhale hi akhilesh ke paksh main najar aa rahi ho, lekin nirahua kii raily or road sho main jis tarah se bheed umad rahi he agar wo vot main tabdeel hoti he to sapa ke liye yahaan jeet kaa paracham fahraana aasaan nahin hoga
 Describing Akhilesh as an outsider versus regional, Nirhua wants to win the hearts of the people of Azamgarh
 haalanki ilaake ke log chunavi mizaaj ko akhilesh ke paksh main bataate hai
 However, some also believe that the battle for the SP President is not as easy as it is being thought
 akhilesh yadav namakan ke baad azamgarh main buudhvaar ko basapa adhyaksh ke saath raily karne pahunch the
 While Nirhua continues to make its presence here
 azamgarh kaa jaateey sameekaran sapa ke durg ko majboot banaata he or is baar basapa bhi uske saath he
 In such a situation, Akhilesh seems even stronger for Yadav
 azamgarh seat par kareeb 19 lakh matadaataaon main se saadhe teen lakh se adhik yadav, teen lakh se zyada musalmaan or kareeb teen lakh dalit hai
 Ethnic mathematics here can make Akhilesh's path easy and difficult for Nirhua
 akhilesh ke liye sabase sef sitapurvanchal vishvavidhyalay ke professor digvijay singh rathore kehete hai ki purvanchal nahin balki puure uttar pradesh main akhilesh yadav ke liye sabase sef seat azamgarh he
 Both the caste and political equation is in favor of Akhilesh, due to which he has landed in the elections from here
 azamgarh jile kii 10 vidhansabha siton main se 9 sapa or basapa ke paas he
 Both the parties do not have so many seats in any other district of the state
 yahi nahin ramakant yadav jinhone mulaayam singh ko pichley chunaav main kadi takkar di thi, wo bhi is baar azamgarh se baahar chunaav lard rahe hai
 Congress has made this path even easier by not putting candidates in front of Akhilesh
 digvijay singh kehete hai ki is baar ke loksabhaa chunaav main sapa ne savarna samudaay se duuri bana rakhi he, jiske chalate wo bijepi ke paksh main he
 But a lot of development work has been done in the SP government in Azamgarh, in such a case, some votes of the upper caste community can also go in their favor
 wo kehete hai ram mandir lahar or modi lahar main bijepi yah seat nahin jeet saki thi
 He says that the BJP has fielded Bhojpuri star Nirhua, who hails from Ghazipur in the district next to Azamgarh, his roadshow is getting crowded, but this crowd seems to be more selfie
 aise main yah vot karegi yah kahana mushkil he
 He is saying that any positive result in Nirahua's favor can only come when he will dent the sp's core voters Yadavs
 iske alaava unki lokapriyata ke kaaran gaiyr yadav obosi, gaiyr jatav dalit or savarna tabaka bijepi ke saath khadaa ho saktaa, jisase yahaan baaji palat sakati he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi will address a public meeting in favor of Nirhua in Azamgarh on Thursday to penetrate the fortress of PM modisp, who is reaching for campaigning
 modi factor kaa unako kuch had tak laabh jarur mil saktaa he
 Digvijay says that lack of development, unemployment, lack of any university in the district and nationalism are the main issues in Azamgarh
 yahaan kisaan or vyapaariyon ke tamaam mudde hai, jinhen koi bhi party ahmiyat nahin de rahi he
 All want to taste victory with the help of the caste equation here
 teen dashak se yadav-muslim kaa kabjaazamgarh loksabhaa seat par pichley teen dashak se yadav or muslim kaa hi kabja rahaa he
 Since 1989, only Yadav and Muslim candidates have won from Azamgarh and reached Parliament
 1989 main ram krishna yadav basapa se yahaan jeet kaa silsilaa shuru or 1991 main chandrajit yadav janata dal se jite
 While this phase was of the Ram Mandir movement, despite this, the BJP did not win
 ramakant yadav ne yahaan varsh 1996 or 1999 main sapa pratyaashee ke taur par jeet hasil kii thi
 He won elections on BSP in 2004 and BJP ticket in 2009
 1998 or 2008 main is seat par hue upachunaavon main basapa ke akbar ahamed dampi ne jeet hasil kii thi
