 This thing came to my mind at the time when one of my friends Satendra Singh told me about Aghori Ashram, he got anxious about them as he had seen many scary Aghoris in the skull and black clothes drinking on TV

 wo is baat se khaase naaraaz dikhe ki aghoriyon ko keval shmashaan main maance khate sharaab pite hue media dikhaati he

 Aghori says that these two are incarnations of knowledge, so we have given our ego to the hands of these gurus

 com / hwjhrslj5p Benjamin Netanyahu became the longest-serving prime minister in Israel on Saturday
 isse pehle yah kirtiman desh ke sansthaapak rahe david ben gurian ke naam tha
 Netanyahu has been in the office of Prime Minister for 13 years and 127 days, which is one day more than Gurian, Israel's first Prime Minister
 netanyahu ke 4,873 dinayarushalem post ke anusaar, isroyal ko astitv main aae 25,981 din hue hai, jinamein se aaj tak ke apane kaarykaal main netanyahu 4,873 dinon tak desh ke pradhanmantri ke pad par bane hue hai
 He was elected Prime Minister for the fifth time this year but due to being unable to form a government, he has decided to go to the polls again
 paanchavi baar ageroyal ke piem bane netanyahu logon ke bich kaaphi mashhoor hai
 Netanyahu is currently facing problems with corruption and there is a demand for his resignation
 pradhanmantri ne apane upar lagaae gaye saare aaropon se inkaar karte hue inhen raajnneeti se prerit bataaya
 He became the youngest Prime Minister of Israel at the age of 46, winning elections for the first time in 1996
 netanyahu 1948 ke baad astitv main aae desh ke baad paidaa hone vaale pehle aise netaa bane jo pradhanmantri ke pad tak pahunche
 Netanyahu has been accused of corruption
 Netanyahu has been facing different charges of corruption
 vahiin, aisi bhi khabaren saamne ai thim ki ek francisi dalal ne 2009 ke chunavi campan main netanyahu ko lakhon euro die the taaki wo chunaav jeet saken
 At the same time Netanyahu and his wife Sara were also accused of getting private work from a government contractor

 There will no longer be any reporting of cases related to the Muzaffarpur girl child scandal
 patna hoicourt ne print or electronic media par yah bandish laga di he
 There will be no news related to the earlier investigation and further investigation
 hoicourt ke is aadesh par editors gild ne chintaa jataai he
 The Guild has said that the court should protect the freedom of media, but it is being curbed
 gild ne supreme court or patna hoicourt ke chif justise se apil kii he ki apane faisle kii samiksha karen
 Muzaffarpur girl child scandal would not have happened in front of you today if the media had not exposed it
 mujhe print kii jaankaree nahin he, tivi main thodi bahut khabar sabane dikhaai lekin kashish news channel ne jis tarah se lagaataar is maamle ko ujagar kiya, wo na hota yah cond sibiai ke darvaaze tak nahin pahunchataa
 Probably not even to the court door
 court ko is baat kaa sangyaan lenaa chahie tha ki media kii vajah se hi yah jaghanya aparaadh saamne aayaa he
 Rape and sexual harassment of more than 30 girls in a campus is not a common occurrence
 balki baad main jab baaki media kii sakriyata badi tab or bhi kuch nae tathy saamne aate gaye
 Therefore, at least in this matter, from the court to the Bihar government, the media should be thankful
 court ko yah dhyaan rakhana chahie ki media kii khabaron ke kaaran hi ek kabina mantri ko pad se hatana padaa or sibai ne unke yahaan bhi chhapemari kii
 It is evident from the media's reporting that big people are engaged in suppressing this matter
 reporting se jaanch main madad hi milegi kyonki jaanch shuru hi hui he reporting ke kaaran
 The curbing of reporting will give rise to the suspicion that big people have made arrangements to save themselves
 bachaane kaa ek tarika cese ko taalte jane kaa bhi he
 If there is continuous reporting, new facts will be revealed and there will be pressure on the investigating agencies to appear before the court from time to time by taking their report
 balika grih cond kii reporting un bacchiyon ke bharose ke liye bhi he
 There will be constant threat to them
 koi dabaav daal saktaa he
 Many times the lives of the witnesses are threatened
 kya in sab ashankaon kii padtaal media ko nahin karnaa chahie, or apni khabaron ke zarie adaalat or samaaj ke saamne nahin laana chahie? un bacchiyon kaa koi maa-baap nahin he
 They are helpless to the poor people who are doing ash with the help of the power system
 is vakt media kii reporting hi unka sambal ho saktaa tha
 It is therefore important that the court review its decision
 is aadesh se media ke us tabake main khushi hi hogi jin par is cond kii tah tak jane or khabaron ko laane kaa dabaav pad rahaa tha
 Which by completing the formalities of reporting for a long time, bypassing the news of rape of more than 30 girls in a campus, was a normal news
 ab aise logon ko adaalat ke aadesh se raahat mil jaaegi
 Their relationship will not be at stake
 isliye bhi is faisle kii samiksha zaruri he
 Think of you as an audience and reader
 kya yah aap par roak nahin he? kya aap bilkul nahin jaananaa chahenge ki ek campus main 30 se adhik bacchiyon ke rape ke maamle main kya hua? sibiai kii taraf se jaanch kar rahe es pi kaa tabadalaa kyon hua? kahin istipha dene vaali mantri ko bachaa to nahin liya gaya? kahin cese kamazor kar us vyakti ko bachaa to nahin liya jayega? kya aap vaaki is bhram main hai ki bharat main yah sab hona band ho gaya he? agar aisa he to aap ek kaam kiijie
 Close the newspaper from tomorrow and cut off the connection of the news channel
 kyonki ab kuch galat hi nahin ho rahaa he
 Investigation agency has to be trusted
 reporting hogi nahin to akhbaar kareed kar aap kya karenge
 Why are you buying? amit shah ke bete jai shah ke maamle main bhi adaalat se notice aa gaya
 Reporting stopped
 ab ek nayaa tarika aayaa he
 Of defamation
 bhakthi main dub chuke log is had tak aa gaye hai ki kehane lage hai ki court jane se kya dar he
 Do they know how many lawyers a journalist can take in front of Ambani? Do they not know that a claim of 5000 crores or a claim of 50 crores will scare away many such reporters? If you do not give your favor, then it is a different matter, but when your favor is being printed, then why is defamation being made a weapon? ham kahaan se kahaan pahunch gaye
 Political devotion has brought in the condition that we are justifying losing every freedom
 is tarah ke tark aapako maansik rup se taiyaar kar rahe hai ki chupchaap ghulaam bane raho
 The dock media has left the public like this
 uske liye darshak yaa pathak sirf survey ke saamaan hai
 To survey and show the same back
 agar media main pehle se ye beemaari thi to kya yahi tarika he thik karne kaa? yaa ham thik karnaa hi nahin chaahate?tippaniyan Someone should go and tell those girls that there will be no reporting in this matter
 na tivi main khabar dikhegi na akhbaar main chhapegi
 If the High Court has given this order, then what will be passed on those girls
 kya is aadesh ne balaatkaar kii shikaar ladakiyon ko nihattha nahin kiya he? kya aapane bhi in ladakiyon kaa saath chhod diya he? main aapse puch rahaa hum

 muzaffarpur balika grih cond aaj aapke saamne nahin hota agar media ne ise ujagar nahin kiya hota
 i do not know the print, there was a lot of news in TV, but the way the Kashish news channel consistently exposed the matter, it would not have reached the CBI door
 shaayad adaalat ke darvaaze tak bhi nahin
 The court should have taken cognizance that this heinous crime has come out due to the media
 ek campus main 30 se adhik bacchiyon kaa balaatkaar or unke saath yon atyaachaar saamaanya ghatana nahin he
 But later, when the activism of the rest of the media increased, some more new facts were revealed
 isliye kam se kam is maamle main court se lekar bihar sarkaar ko media kaa shukraguzaar hona chahie
 The court should note that due to media reports, a Kabina minister had to step down and the CBI raided him too
 media kii reporting se hi zaahir ho rahaa he ki is maamle ko dabaane main bade bade log lage hai
 Reporting will only help the investigation because the investigation has already started due to reporting
 reporting par ankush lagane se us shankaa ko bal milegaa ki bade logon ne khud ko bachaane kaa intazaam kar liya he
 One way to save is to avoid the case
 lagaataar reporting hogi to nae nae tathy saamne aaenge or jaanch agenciyon par dabaav rahegaa ki vah apni report lekar adaalat ke saamne samay samay par haazir hoti rahe
 The reporting of the girl child home scandal is also for the trust of those girls
 un par lagaataar khatara bana rahegaa
 One can exert pressure
 kai baar gavaahon kii jaan ko khatara ho jaataa he
 Shouldn't the media investigate all these fears, and bring them to the court and society through their news? Those girls do not have any parents
 ve satta tantra kii madad se aish kar rahe darindon ke aage laachaar hai
 At this time, media reporting could be their strength
 isliye zaruri he ki adaalat apane is faisle kii samiksha kare
 With this order, there will be happiness in the section of the media, who were under pressure to go to the bottom of this scandal and bring the news
 jo lambey samay tak reporting kii aupchaarikta puri kar ek campus main 30 se adhik bacchiyon ke saath balaatkaar kii khabar ko saamaanya khabar banaakar kinare kar rahaa tha
 Now such people will get relief from the court order
 unke sambandh daanv par nahin lagenge
 Therefore, a review of this decision is also necessary
 ek darshak or pathak ke taur par aap sochie
 Is this not stopping you? Would you not like to know exactly what happened in the case of rape of more than 30 girls in one campus? Why was SP transferred by CBI? Has the minister who resigned was not saved? Will that person be saved by weakening the case? Are you really under the illusion that this has stopped happening in India? If so, then you do one thing
 kal se akhbaar band kar dijie or news channel kaa conection katwa dijie
 Because nothing wrong is happening now
 jaanch angency par bharosa hi karnaa hoga
 What will you do by buying the newspaper if not reporting? kyon kareed rahe hai? In the case of Amit Shah's son Jai Shah, notice came from the court
 reporting band ho gai
 Now a new way has come
 manahani kaa
 People who have drowned in devotion have come to such an extent that they are saying that they are afraid of going to court
 kya unhen pataa he ki ambani ke saamne koi patrkaar kitne vakil lekar ja sakegaa? kya unhen nahin pataa he ki 5000 karod kaa daawa yaa 50 karod kaa daawa aise kitne reportron ko daraa degaa? aap apana paksh dijie na chape to alag baat he lekin jab aapkaa paksh dene par chap rahaa he to phir manahani ko hathiyaar kyon banaaya ja rahaa he? Where did we reach raajnneetik bhakthi ne is haal main laa diya he ki ham har azaadi khone ko sahi tehra rahe hai
 Such arguments are preparing you mentally to remain silent
 godi media aise hi janata ko chhod chukaa he
 For him, the audience or readers are just like surveys
 survey karne or waapas usee ko dikhaane ke
 If this disease was already in the media, is this the way to cure it? Or we don't want to fix? Comments koi jaakar un bacchiyon se sirf itnaa kah de ki ab is maamle main koi reporting nahin hogi
 Neither TV will see the news nor will it be printed in the newspaper
 ye aadesh hai court ne diya he to un bacchiyon par kya guzaregi
 Has not this order disarmed rape victims? Have you left these girls too? i am asking you aap jo ek darshak hai, ek pathak hai

 ek darshak or pathak ke taur par aap sochie
 Is this not stopping you? Would you not like to know exactly what happened in the case of rape of more than 30 girls in one campus? Why was SP transferred by CBI? Has the minister who resigned was not saved? Will that person be saved by weakening the case? Are you really under the illusion that this has stopped happening in India? If so, then you do one thing
 kal se akhbaar band kar dijie or news channel kaa conection katwa dijie
 Because nothing wrong is happening now
 jaanch angency par bharosa hi karnaa hoga
 What will you do by buying the newspaper if not reporting? kyon kareed rahe hai? In the case of Amit Shah's son Jai Shah, notice came from the court
 reporting band ho gai
 Now a new way has come
 manahani kaa
 People who have drowned in devotion have come to such an extent that they are saying that they are afraid of going to court
 kya unhen pataa he ki ambani ke saamne koi patrkaar kitne vakil lekar ja sakegaa? kya unhen nahin pataa he ki 5000 karod kaa daawa yaa 50 karod kaa daawa aise kitne reportron ko daraa degaa? aap apana paksh dijie na chape to alag baat he lekin jab aapkaa paksh dene par chap rahaa he to phir manahani ko hathiyaar kyon banaaya ja rahaa he? Where did we reach raajnneetik bhakthi ne is haal main laa diya he ki ham har azaadi khone ko sahi tehra rahe hai
 Such arguments are preparing you mentally to remain silent
 godi media aise hi janata ko chhod chukaa he
 For him, the audience or readers are just like surveys
 survey karne or waapas usee ko dikhaane ke
 If this disease was already in the media, is this the way to cure it? Or we don't want to fix? Comments koi jaakar un bacchiyon se sirf itnaa kah de ki ab is maamle main koi reporting nahin hogi
 Neither TV will see the news nor will it be printed in the newspaper
 ye aadesh hai court ne diya he to un bacchiyon par kya guzaregi
 Has not this order disarmed rape victims? Have you left these girls too? i am asking you aap jo ek darshak hai, ek pathak hai

 Azam Khan said that remember Gujarat in 2002 and think that you did not even reach Assam and bloodbath started
 ajam khan ne kaha, 'apane phaayde ke liye desh ko ghate main daal diya gaya he
 It has damaged relationships

 If we do not accept the courts, you will call us dictators
 supreme court ke 7 notice mujhe mili, kaha gaya ki maine dange karaae
 Who cried more than me? Who would have hurt more than me? Murders were shown, not murderers
 ghar jalaate dikhaae gaye, ghar jalaane vaale nahin
 Rape not shown rapist

 We will get punishment for our responsibility
 'ajam khan se jab poocha gaya ki kyon ye kaha gaya ki upi ko gujarat nahin banane denge
 So he turned back and asked who said that

 Azam Khan's reply was, 'talking of Saifai, the news anchor who showed the news of Muzaffarnagar also had makeup
 unki ankhen nam nahin thi
 i cannot hear wrong about the leader, and such a leader will rule the country
 'modi par hamalaa
 
 
 Azam Khan said, 'many distances have been extended
 16 saal se 40 saal tak kaa noujvaan jo bhashaa bol rahaa he wo durbhagyapurna he

 Knowing this truth, we will again fall in love with each other
 'da charlie muslim army' ne hamen jeet dilaai thi, mere hindu bachche ye janenge to wo kyon hamase mohabbat nahin karenge
 Azam Khan lashed out at the Election Commission
 
 
 ajam khan ne kaha, 'chunaav ayog niyam kanoon kii dhajjiyaan uda di hai

 'modi sarkaar ai to bahusankhyak bhi bhugtenge
 
 
 
 ajam khan ne kaha, 'aisa nahin he ki sirf alpsankhyak bhugtenge desh kaa bahusankhyak bhi bhugtegaa
 Because this time there will be no Modi government but Modi government
 2002 kaa gujarat yaad he? assam main unka helicopter utraa bhi nahin tha or vahaan hinsa bhadak gai thi
 When Azam Khan was asked whether the bus wounds would be trampled in the coming times, he said, 'ask those who say go to Pakistan, leave home

 If you will prove it, then i will hold my ear and apologize, and if you cannot prove it, then you will say that a mistake has been made
 'aane vaala kal hoga corporate ke haathon main
 
 
 Referring to Adani, Azam Khan said, 'tomorrow will be in the hands of the corporate

 He said that for the last one year, the BJP had been making paper announcements to run programs, agitations and campaigns in opposition to the Congress government, every time the dates and communiqués of the next program continued, but the BJP could never do any effective program
 congress ke rajkumaar rahul gandhi ko lagata he ki bharat aisa computer he, jisamen congress naam kaa program 'by difolt' padaa hua he
 He said very confidently, 'if India is a computer, then Congress is its' default program'
 rahul ne party kii rajya ikaayiyon, enesayuai or yuvak congress ke pratinidhiyon ko sambodhit karte hue kaha ki congress desh ke multatv ko samete hue he
 'don't be silent on the propaganda of the opposition, cut it with concrete facts: Rahul' In such a manner when Narendra Modi is constantly attacking the Congress, Rahul advised his party people that this country does not like anger and aggression

 He said in the Lok Sabha on Thursday that in order to bring the country into disrepute, talks about slowdown in auto sector and reduced sales are being done
 unhone sawaal kiya ki agar auto kshetra main mandi he tab ek ek ghar main kai gaadiyaan or sadak par jam kyon he?unhone kaha ki desh main aarthik mandi kaa maahaul khadaa kiya ja rahaa he
 It is said that there has been a decrease in purchases in the auto sector
 yah desh ko badnaam karne ke liye kiya ja rahaa he
 He questioned, 'if there was less procurement in the auto sector then why are there roads on the roads? Today, there are many vehicles in each house
 'kisaanon par kya bolesansad ke sheetakaaleen satr main virendra singh ne kisaanon kaa mudda uthaaya saath hi congress ko gheraa
 During his speech, he was also seen commenting humorously on some mps
 virendra singh jab bhaashan de rahe the to us dauraan ek saansad ne unhen tokaa
 In response, MP Virender Singh jokingly said that you sit brother
 
 
 tumko main jaanata hum
 In fact, under Rule 193 in the Lok Sabha, there was a discussion on loss of crops and effect on farmers
 is dauraan virendra singh ne kaha ki jab bhi satr hote hai kisaanon kii charchaa jarur hoti he
 This country is a country of farmers and Parliament is forced to hold discussions
 mujhe lagata he kisaanon kii charchaa par unke samasyayon ke samaadhaan ke liye saansadon ko ekamat hona chahie
 And i think the most senior MP sitting here will agree that the mps are unanimous in resolving the farmers' problem
 unhone kaha ki jab charchaa hoti he kisaanon kii samasya ke samaadhaan ke liye to ek sarkaar jo kaam kar rahi hoti he to duusare dalon ke logon ko lagata he ki ye sarkaar kyon kaam karti he
 These governments have failed, let's focus on that
 ek din main samasya nahin khadi hothibliya sebijepisansad ne kaha ki kisaanon kii samasya ek din main nahin khadi hui he
 And i am an MP from the party of governance and can say with a claim that there is not even a solution in a day
 krishi kii samasya ek din main khadi nahin hoti naa hi ek din main samaadhaan nikalataa he
 He praised the Modi government and said that this government is working for the farmers
 vipaksh par nishaanaa sadhate hue unhone kaha ki aap log kisaanon se baat nahin karte hai
 Farmers read in books

 The days of the completion of the Manesar Palwal Expressway project, which has been stuck for years, have come to a close
 2006 main shuru hue is project ko saal 2010 tak puraa ho janaa tha, lekin paanch saal biit jane ke baad bhi kaam puraa nahin ho sakaa
 This expressway of a distance of 135 kilometers to two 'enemies' of Delhi can prove to be a boon for battling pollution and terrible traffic jams
 keempi express ve naa keval ensiaar kii ek nai pahchaan ban saktaa he, balki desh kii rajdhani ko uske do sabase bade dushmano trephic jam or pradooshan se mukti bhi de saktaa he
 The General Secretary of the Delhi Goods Transporters Association said that if the KMP Expressway is built, the trucks passing through Delhi will leave from outside and Delhi will become a paradise
 keempi express ve ke ban jane se dilli kii aabhohawaa bhi kaaphi had tak saaf ho jaaegi
 Delhi's air has dissolved, the pollution in Zahardilli has reached dangerous levels
 dilliwaale gadiyon se nikalne vaale carbon emishan ke chalate hawa main ghulaa jehar pine ko majaboor hai
 According to the recent survey, Particulate Matter 2 present in the air of Delhi
 5 kii seemaa 60 he, lekinsdakapar chalate vakt dilli ke logon ko iske 600-700 ke str se do chaar hona padataa he
 According to experts, this is the main reason for the excessive traffic of heavy vehicles in Delhi and this will be reduced to a great extent by the formation of KMP Express
 dilli main pani par raajnneeti lagaataar jari he lekin ab is raajnneeti ne nayaa mode le liya he
 All politics has come to a halt only around an Aam Aadmi Party MLA
 is AAP vidhayak kaa naam he dinesh mohaniya (dinesh Mohaniya)
 Dinesh Mohania is an Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLA from Sangam Vihar in Delhi and is the Deputy Chairman of Delhi Jal Board
 kendriya upabhokta maamle main mantri ramvilas paswan (ram Vilas Paswan) is baat par ad gaye hai ki dilli main pani kii gunvattta kii jaanch ke liye jo saajha team banane kii baat chal rahi he usamen dinesh mohaniya nahin hone chahie
 Ram Vilas Paswan challenged Kejriwal at a press conference on Thursday and said, 'we challenge CM Kejriwal to get him investigated
 hamane pehle hi din do-do logon kii team banane ke liye bolaa tha jisamen dilli sarkaar ne jo naam die hai unamem ek vidhayak hai
 After all, what does an MLA know about a lab? 'darasal jab dilli main bhartiya maanak beuro kii jaanch report par vivaad badha to dilli sarkaar ke suzav par kendriya upabhokta maamle mantri ramvilas paswan ne centre or dilli sarkaar kii saajha team se pani kii gunvattta kii jaanch karaane kaa faisla kiya
 While Ram Vilas Paswan nominated the Director General and Deputy Director General of the Bureau of Indian Standards for a shared team on behalf of the central government, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal nominated Dinesh Mohania, vice chairman of Delhi Jal Board and Shalabh Kumar, a member of Delhi Jal Board
 buudhvaar ko hi ramvilas paswan ne dinesh mohaniya ke naam par aapatti jataai thi or kaha tha ki is team main koi export yaa adhikari hona chahie netaa nahin
 Dinesh Mohania is an Aam Aadmi Party MLA from Sangam Vihar, so Kejriwal should name a non-political name in his team instead
 lekin paswan ke kehane ke 24 ghante baad bhi mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne doosraa naam nahin diya jisase yah sandesh ja rahaa he ki dilli sarkaar dinesh mohaniya ko saajha team main namit karne par ad gai he
 While the central government has gone further with the argument that there should be no leader in the investigation team
 guuruuvaar dopaher dilli jal board ke upaadhyaksh dinesh mohaniya ne press conference kar jaankaree di ki dilli jal board ne un sabhi 11 jagahon se sample liye hai jahaan se bhartiya maanak beuro ne sample liye the or vah fail ho gaye the
 Mohania questioned the Bureau of Indian Standards investigation and dismissed its report
 mohaniya se jab ramvilas paswan kii tippanee par sawaal kiya gaya to dinesh mohaniya ne kaha ' hamen is maamle main vyakti kii bajaae prakriya par dhyaan dena chahie or paardarshita par janaa chahie
 All the samples taken should be in front of everyone, they should be sealed properly
 unki baqayada prakriya ho
 They should be sent to the lab and whatever results they receive should be kept in front of the media and in front of the public so that the public can decide for themselves whether the water is clean or not

 Excerpts from the conversation with him: Is the presence of Union ministers and such a large number of mps active in the election campaign a sign that the state unit of the party does not have sufficient organizational capacity and structure? The media and especially the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) The campaign is running on the same agenda that BJP is working so hard because there is electoral competition here, and our workers from all over the country Hi work local unit is not active because they are so
 lekin yah sach nahin he
 Every BJP worker works equally hard in every election

 At the ideological level, who is the biggest threat to the BJP — you or the Congress? You have no ideology at all
 aakhir uski vichaardhaara kya he? kuch shikave-shikayaton ko juta lenaa hi to vichaardhaara nahin hota
 What is your reaction to this, that the BJP asks for votes in the name of development but after coming to power, it starts to fuel the 'ghar Wapsi' campaign? Firstly, 'ghar Wapsi' is not bjp's program

 ek smartphone jo ek packet cigarette kii keemat se bhi sasti he
 The offer price of the smartphone launched by Ringing Bells as 'freedom 251' is like a dream
 telecom jagat se lekar kaarobaar kii duniya tak koi is keemat par vishwaas nahin kar rahaa
 But now 50 lakh phones have to be delivered within three months
 sachai he kya? kya ye bhartiya telecom udyog main kranti laane vaala nayaa product he? yaa phir yah ponji scam he? yaa phir yah ki sachai kahin or hi chhipi he?'aaj tak' kii special investegative team ne is rahasy kii gutthi sulajhaai he
 To find out the truth of 'freedom 251', our team started the operation from the office of Adcom Company in Kirti Nagar, Delhi
 aapako bataa den ki adcom yaa adwantage communication mobile phone or tablet kii nirmaataa or vitarak he
 Ringing Bells bought the phone from Adcom! Our team meets the owner of Adcom, Sanjeev Bhatia
 bhaatia ne hamen bataaya ki jis phone ko apana bataakar ringing bels televijan channelon par bade-bade daawey kar rahi hai, darasal wo adcom se kharida gaya he
 He says, 'look, we got an order, we gave it to him
 hamane nishciya hi iske evaj main paise liye, kyonki hamaare bich isse pehle koi interection nahin tha
 This all happened around 2-3 days before the launch
 tab tak hamen maaloom nahin tha ki FREEDOM 251 karke kuch he
 Bhatia further said that he has supplied the phone
 yahi nahin unhone kaha, 'aap chahen to hamaara puraa unit dekh sakate hai
 Its production is going on in our factory
 agar aap janaa chahenge to aapako apni factory main visit karvaa saktaa hum
 We just bought the panel: Our team now reaches the offices of Ringing Bells in Sector 63, Noida to investigate the claims of Ringing Bellsadcom
 jab hamane ringing bels ke president ashok chaddha se adcom ke daawey main poocha to wo turant bachaav kii mudra main aa gaye
 Chadha had to admit that the phone was purchased from another company
 lekin phir bhi unhone jor diya ki adcom se sirf panel kharida gaya, jabaki phone ke baaki hisson ko ringing bels ne hi assembl kiya he
 When 'aaj Tak' and Kureda, the ringing bells had to admit that the phone was not theirs
 lekin unhone ye bhi daawa kar diya ki sirf tach plate kahin or se kharida gaya tha, jabaki phone kaa baaki hissaa yaheen anceble kiya gaya
 However, Adcom has also raised questions on this claim
 'asli naam he ikon-4 white'adcom ke sanjeev bhaatia ne hamen bataaya ki baat sirf ek part kii nahin he, balki puraa phone adcom se kharida gaya tha
 According to Bhatia, 'freedom 251' is actually 'icon-4 White'
 bhaatia ke mutabik ringing bels ne panel se ikon-4 kaa brands nem mitaa diya or apana stikar chipka diya
 Adcom claims that it sold Rs 3600 per smart phone to Ringing Bells
 sanjeev bhaatia ne kaha, 'ye dhokhaa he or hamen kuch nuksaan hota he to nishchit taur par humlog unako court main ghasitenge
 Will take legal action
 mobile kholkar to jaise andar main dekhenge IMEI number vagairah
 
 
 The battery is ours
 iske upar cover chadhaaya he
 This is our battery, we put a sticker or cover on it
 3600 kaa phone 251 main kaise?vastav main ye abujh paheli kii tarah he ki kaise ek company3600 rupee main mobile kharidkar 251 rupee membazar main bechney ja rahi he? adcom ke maalik ke bayaan ne ringing bels ke daavon par gambhir sawaal khadey kar die hai
 So are the ringing bells just a balloon of confusion or is there something else behind it? Giving the assembling to two companies, Bells told us that the company has two more near Delhi for assembling 'freedom 251' mobile phones
 Has assigned a production unit to
 ye company hai vaai technology or iminence technology
 The Ringing Bells management also told us that they have already ordered 50 lakh units of the phone worth Rs 251
 company kaa daawa he ki phone kii bikri isi saal june main shuru ho jaaegi
 Not allowed to start assembling yet
 How is the construction of 50 lakh phones going? To know this, we first reached the office of Eminence Technology in Greater Noida
 yahaan ham company kii nideshak nidhi khullar se mili
 Nidhi revealed that she was approached by Ringing Bells just five days before the blazing launch
 nidhi ne ye bhi bataaya ki ab tak unhen assembling shuru karne ke liye ringing bels se hari jhandi bhi nahin mili he
 We then reached Janakpuri in Delhi to meet Prabhupreet Singh, business head of y Technology
 unhone bhi bataaya ki ab tak 251 rupee ke phone kaa production shuru nahin hua he
 50 lakh phones in 90 days, but how? It is believed that both production units have to produce 50 lakh phones in ninety days
 jabaki assembling kaa kaam abhi shuru bhi nahin hua he
 Ringing bells have not yet hit any customer money
 company kaa kahana he ki delivery ke vakt hi nakad paisa legi
 But it is clear from the investigation of 'aaj Tak' that customers need to be careful with the tall claims of the makers of 'freedom 251'
 kya kehete hai aalochakpichley dinon rangarang lonching ke baad ringing bels company kii management team yah bataane ke liye hamaare studio main thi ki kaise desi nirmaan se smart phone kii keemat behad sasti ho jaaegi
 But the telecom industry reacted sharply to the claims of ringing bells

 htm kisi kii kamai hajaaron main ho or daulat arabon main, to maamla samajhnaa mushkil nahin he
 UP Police and ED have caught an ARTO, who was known as Yadav Singh of Purvanchal
 kaali kamai kaa ek cheharaa, jiske paas sirf ek sarkari naukari ke badaulat arabon kii daulat he
 The secret of his black earnings is surprising everyone
 der se hi sahi akhirkaar kaanoon ke haath us sarkari afasar kii girebaan tak pahunch hi gaye, jise sarkaar ne tainaat to kiya tha kaayade kanoonon kii hifaazat ke liye, lekin kanoonon kii hifaazat karte-karte wo khud hi kaanoon tod kar kaali kamai kaa aisa dhankuber ban baitha, jiskaa samrajya dekh kar ab khud sarkaar hi hairaan he
 RS Yadav
 eartio, chandauli
 'kali Earnest Dhankuber'
 ji haa, yahi naam he iskaa
 This is the position of this man
 lekin apane isi ohade kii aad main ares yadav naam ke is shaks par chand saalon main arabon kii kaali kamai kaa aisa ilzaam he, jo alag-alag shaharon main uski akut daulat kii surat main police or inforcement diarectoret ke haath laga he
 Rather, the condition now is that from where the property of ARTO RS Yadav starts and ends, no one has the exact account of it right now
 lekin mote taur par eartio kii karatuuton kii jaanch kar rahe afasaron kaa kahana he ki banaras main uske paas hotel, gorakhpur main mal, aaleeshaan makaan or volvon bason kii flit kaa bhi pataa chalaa he
 Now the question is, what the hell did this ARTO do, from which it earned so much money overnight? After all, what was the way of his corruption? And why was he not caught yet? Officials investigating RS Yadav say that with the help of his visiting staff, Bihar was running a recovery gang at Chandauli border in UP
 wo baaluu lad kar upi aanevaale trakon ko over loding ke naam par roktaa or har trek se 7 se 15 hazaar rupee vasuul karata
 In this way, he was earning millions of rupees every day for years
 yahaan tak kii uske khilaaf pehle bhi kai baar shikaayat kii gai, lekin pichhali sarkaron ne hameshaa se in shikayaton kii andekhi kar di
 But the matter kept moving forward
 police kii maane to is baar jab unhen chandauli main avaidh vasuuli kii shikaayat mili, to usne parivahan vibhaag ke kuch mulaazimon ko range haath giraftaar kiya
 When he was questioned, the wire of recovery reached its kingpin ARTO RS Yadav
 unhen baad main police ne jonpur ke paas se giraftaar kar liya
 Although he is still telling himself innocent
 ares yadavaki zyaadati kaa shikaar ho chuke logon kaa kahana he ki chunki wo pichley kaafii samay se kai rajanetaaon ko apni kaali kamai ki hissaa detaa rahaa he, isliye ab se pehle kabhi pakadaa nahin gaya
 In such a situation, now it is to be seen whether the investigation reaches RS Yadav's bosses or ends here

 BSP chief Mayawati is coming down with full force in the political battlefield of Gujarat
 lekin dalit maton ke sahare gujarat main apni jaden jamaane ko betaab mayawati ke armaanon par pani pherane ke liye congress ne turup kaa patta chalaa he
 Congress has embraced Jignesh Mevani, the young leader of the Dalit movement in Gujarat
 gujarat ke vidhansabha chunaav main jignesh ne congress ko samarthan karne kaa elaan bhi kar diya he
 With the help of this bet, the Congress is also trying to make a dent in the political deposits held by the BSP in Gujarat

 Even though the dalit-adivasi BSP has not won a single seat in the assembly elections held in Gujarat so far, its enthusiasm for contesting has not gone down
 is baar bhi bispi ne gujarat kii 182 siton par puri takat ke saath utarane kaa man banaaya he
 The bsp's jamapunjibsp fielded 34 of its candidates in the 2002 assembly elections in Gujarat, none of which won
 2002 main bispi ko 0
 32 percent votes were received
 2007 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main bispi ne 166 ummidavaar utaare or sabhi ko haar kaa munh dekhnaa padaa
 Although the party was successful in increasing its vote share, it got 2
 62 fisadi vot mila
 In 2012, the BSP fought in 163 assembly seats
 25 fisadi vot mila
 That is, BSP suffered losses as compared to 2007
 gujarat main 40 surakshit sitengujarat main 7 fisadi dalit matadaata hai, to vahiin 11 fisadi adivasee
 In Gujarat, 40 out of 182 assembly seats are reserved for Dalit and Adivasi society
 inamen se 13 dalit or 27 adivasee samaaj ke liye hai
 If seen in the last election, the BJP dominated the Dalit seats
 13 siton main se 10 par bijepi ne or 3 par congress ne jeet darj kii thi
 Congress won the tribal seats
 27 adivasee siton main se 16 par congress or 10 par bijepi ne jeet darj kii thi
 According to the 2015 report of the National Crime Records Bureau, Gujarat is second in the country in cases of atrocities on scheduled castes, which have caused serious injuries, according to the 2015 report of the National Crime Records Bureau
 gujarat lagaataar utpeedan ke maamle saamne aa rahe hai
 Let me tell you that there was a movement in Gujarat on the beating of Dalit youths in Una, which was led by Jignesh Mevani
 is andolan ke jariye hi jignesh ko desh main pahchaan mili or wo gujarat me daliton ke sabase bade cheharaa banakar ubhare hai
 Gujarat's political equation has changed with Jignesh's support of Congress
 aise main congress ko dalit samudaay ke bich apni jagah banane kaa mauka mil gaya he
 With this, the BJP as well as the BSP are being considered a setback
 dalit chintak va dilli vishvavidhyalay ke professor ratan laal maanate hai ki jignesh ke jane se congress ko phayda milegaa
 Congress benefits from Jignesh: Bina, who works for the upliftment of Dalits in Banahamabad, says that the Dalit voters in Gujarat are not very decisive
 yahi vajah he ki unki haalat kaaphi dayaneey he
 Dalits have never been in the agenda of political parties in Gujarat
 lekin oona ghatana ne desh ko jhakajor diya he
 This movement has given Jignesh Mevani a strong hold in the Dalit community
 aise main unka congress ke samarthan karne se congress ko phayda milegaa
 BSP will be harmed: Suman Ambedkarite tribal thinker Sunil Kumar Suman said that Jignesh Mevani has become an identity as a Dalit face in Gujarat
 bhale hi vah ambedkarwaadi andolan se na nikle hon lekin gujarat main dalit andolan se jariye jignesh mewaani ne apni pahchaan banaai he
 He is not a big face in Gujarat, but he is the same
 ye baat sach he ki unka aadhaar puure gujarat main nahin he, lekin oona ke aasapaas kaaphi he
 He said that Mayawati should not contest free elections
 gujarat main mayawati kaa jameen par na kaam he or na hi janaadhar
 While Jignesh has become the voice of the Dalits in Gujarat, the misery of the people is joining the pain
 jignesh kaa congress ke samarthan karne congress ko acha phayda milegaa to vahiin bispi ko nuksaan uthaanaa padegaa

 The judges said that the court should have the necessary documents before any action on this petition

 In Uttarakhand, there has been a tussle between two ministers over the goat swayamvar
 yah swayamvar 23 or 24 farvari ko hona he
 Tourism and Culture Minister Satpal Maharaj and Minister of State for Animal Husbandry Rekha Arya have come face-to-face on the issue of goat swayamvar
 shahari vikaas mantri madan kowshik is maamle main satpal maharaj ke saath khadey dikh rahe hai
 Actually it is organized by an NGO in Swayamvar Dhanaulti
 is aayojan main pashupaalan rajya mantri rekha arya ko bataur mukhya atithi bulaayaa gaya he
 Rekha Arya wants to participate in it
 aisa nahin he ki yah aayojan yahaan pehali baar ho rahaa he
 Local institution Cotwillage is already organizing this event
 sanstha kaa tark he ki unnat nasl kii bakriyon ko laakar unka swayamvar karavaaya jaataa he jisase uttam kism kii bakriyaan paidaa hon
 Now the biggest screw in this is that the proposed Swayamvara has to be accompanied by the Vedic chant
 bas yahi baat paryaton evam samskruti mantri satpal maharaj ko khal gai
 He argues that the marriage of goats in the midst of chanting is to ridicule Vedic customs
 keval aalochana karne tak hi satpal maharaj simit nahin rahe
 He also canceled the press conference of Rekha Arya, Minister of State for Animal Husbandry, which was to be organized to inform Rekha Arya's participation in Bakri Swayamvar
 ab faisla mukhyamantri ke haath!maamla is kadar badha ki vikaas kaaryon or mahatvapurn muddon ko chhodkar bakrii swayamvar pichley dinon pradesh cabinet kii baithak kaa mudda bhi ban gaya
 Not only this, the decision of whether or not there will be a chant in Goat Swayamvar was handed over to the Chief Minister
 shahari vikaas mantri bhi paryaton evam samskruti mantri ke sathcabinet kii batak ke baad media se baatcheet ke dauraan shaskeey pravaktaa va shahari vikaas mantri madan kowshik bhi paryaton mantri satpal maharaj se sahamat dikhaai die
 He said that goats have a good plan to promote animal husbandry
 par aise maukey par vaidic mantron kaa uccharan nahin hona chahie
 But on this issue, where on the one hand the talk of self-goat with a mantra is being considered against the culture, on the other hand many arguments are also coming in its favor
 paksh main bhi hai thos tark!bakrii swayamvar ke paksh main sabase pehla tark aayaa ki vedon or puranic dharm granthon main to matsay avatar, kacchap avatar, shookar avatar, varah avatar, srihari vishnu ke avatar rup poojaneey hai
 Then there was also the argument that the head of the first venerable Lord Ganesha also has an elephant's forehead
 thik isi tarah bhagwaan shiv ke sasur or sati ke pita daksh ko bhi bakre kaa sir lagaaya gaya tha
 Daksha worshiped Shiva with that mouth, then people are asking from where did the goat become impure
 pashupaalan mantri ne diya chutila javabapashupaalan rajya mantri is virodh se aahat to hai par haar nahin maani he
 Recently, in Roorkee, Rekha Arya answered Satpal Maharaj's objection in a very sarcastic manner on the media's questions
 rekha arya ne poocha, tota pakshi ram-ram ratata he use ram kaa naam kisi se puch kar ratna chahie?rekha arya ne kaha mantra matlab hota he prabhaav aisa asar jo kisi ke bheetar koi badlaav kar de
 He said that i do not oppose anyone but if something can change for good, then i am not in favor of stopping him from any opposition
 pashupaalan mantri ne elaan kiya ki unka mahakama pradesh main 23 or 24 ko bakrii swayamvar ke aayojan main hissaa legaa
 The objective of this event is to bring information about goat rearing to cattle rearing as well as to promote animal husbandry
 is swayamvar main unnat kism ke pashu bhi laae jate hai or pashu mela lagata he

 Offensive statement was given on the victim of Delhi gang rape
 Asaram had said that if the student had pleaded with his hands in front of him, had made him a brother, his heart would have melted and he would have left her
 iske alaava asaram ne us chaatra ke charitra par bhi sawaal khadey kiye the

 The Bharat Rang Mahotsav (bharatangam) is again in its 21st year as the twentieth
 ek kam isliye kyonki pichley saal mejamaan rashtriya natya vidhyalay (enesdy) ne nideshak vaaman kendre ke chaate tale vah theatre olympic main tabdeel ho gaya tha

 Just say that one generation is complete now
 in 21 varshon main enesdy ke snaatakon kii taadaad 500 se badhkar 1,000 se upar pahunch gai he
 In the changing world of theater and growing "exposure", learning from NSD is not giving the psychological edge as before
 bhaarangam ne purvardh yani dasek varshon main acchhee jameen todi or nae darshak taiyaar kiye
 But gradually his charismatic element began to fade
 nai jameen todane vaali kai yuva pratibhaaen ab bhaarangam main ruchi nahin dikhaatin
 The entries of the Mahindra Excellence in Theater Awards (meta) clear this trend
 rangakarmiyon kaa ek tabaka vah he jo bhaarangam main apane naatakon kii acchhee dividi bhejne aadi kii sharten hi thik se puri na kar paane se daud se baahar ho jaataa he
 At one level, there is a struggle in many streams to take the story forward through design, technology and other challenging experiments
 manch par ek or chunauti elidi lits ne pesh kii he
 This has caused a stir among the theater and the audience about the changing aesthetic legislation of the theater
 enesdy ke bheetar hameshaa kii tarah yah bahes bhi jari he ki vidhyalay kaa kaam utsav karnaa nahin he
 Whatever it is, if you want to keep the brand-new Bharngam relevant, then it will be necessary to rethink its form

 At the same time, in a special conversation with NDTV, the state Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan claimed that no one is being saved in this case
 chote se lekar bade sabhi logon ke saath kanoon ek jaisaa vyavhaar kar rahaa he
 Last year, the Madhya Pradesh police made the governor and his son an accused in the case

 Movement on movement, claim on claim and how much black money has spread so much
 aaj indian express akhbaar nayaa aankada lekar aayaa he, iske mutabik 1195 bharatiyon ke 25 hajaar karod rupye swiss bainkon main jamaa hai
 After this, the debate on black money will intensify
 lekin hallaa karne se pehle ek baat par gaur karen- akhbaar ne mote aksharon main ek bhi jagah kaale dhan shabd kaa istemaal nahin kiya he
 Yes, it is written so much in one place in thick letters that this disclosure will increase the scope of SIT work on black money
 khayr aage chalakar hamaara yah bhram tut jaae ki yah kaala dhan he, usase pehle ek motaa hisaab lagane main kya harj he
 Even if the government brings back the entire amount of 25 thousand crores in a jolt, every person will get only 200 rupees
 yah us 15 lakh kii aakarshak rakam se bahut kam he, jo pradhanmantri pad ke aakankshi ke taur par narendra modi bataaya karte the
 This amount is so low that even two days wages of MNREGA are more than this
 yani agar yah dhan kaala bhi he to siyaasi hasaraton ke khajaane se bahut kam he
 But this author is very skeptical that this money will prove to be black
 ise jamaa karne waalon or karaane waalon ne is par itani fere and lavali laga rakhi he ki iskaa bada hissaa kanoonee paaya jayega
 For example, in the name of the country's largest Dhannaseth brothers Mukesh and Anil Ambani, Rs 164-164 crore are being shown in Swiss bank
 bade ambani ke pravaktaa ne danke kii chot par kah diya he ki ambani sahab kaa duniya ke kisi kone main gaiyrkanoonee bank khaataa nahin he
 Chhota Ambani's spokesperson has denied having an account
 jet airways ke sansthaapak adhyaksh naresh goyal ne kahala bheja he ki ve to pravasi bhartiya hai, yahaan ke kanoon se unka kya lenaa
 Some nobles have said that they have already settled the case in India through proper legal procedures
 ve apana jurmaana bhi chukaa chuke hai
 The amount in the account is legal
 suchi main shaamil jin dhannasethon ne tippanee nahin kii he ve bhi jald hi aise bayaan jari kar denge
 They can do this because they have deposited the money in the bank, not hiding it in a cellar
 bank jis desh main bhi banataa he, uske kanoonon ke tahat banataa he
 The bank that is depositing money internationally is bound by international laws
 vahaan jo paisa jamaa ho rahaa he vah bhi in kanoonon ke daayre main hota he
 That is, if this money is also black, then all the economic laws have made it white to a great extent
 aise main agar bharat bahut sakht kaarywahi karata bhi he to vah us pulisia karrwai kii tarah hogi jisamen hatya or apharan ke aropi to daroga ji ke saath chaay pienge or maamuli girhakat jo jamaanat tak nahin kara sakate jail main honge
 When we cannot catch the black money inside the country, then what will bring the money from outside
 vaise bhi bhartiya bainkon main isse badi rakam ke difaltaron ke naam aaj tak desh main koi sarkaar saarvajanik kar pai he kya
 If these things seem so pessimistic, then think that the government has considered all the people in the list as thieves of black money and the court is sending them to jail
 ye ve log honge jinhen aapaki arthvyavastha kii ridh kaha jaataa he, ye ve log honge jinke pariwaron ke saath muskuraati photo khinchane main bade se bade netaa ko majaa aata he, ye ve log honge jinase cricket ke maichon kii raunak he, ye ve log hai jinke paise se filmein banati hai, ye ve log hai jinase desh kaa sara gaiyr sarkari bazaar chalata he
 In such a situation, when they will be handcuffed and they will say that if we are thieves, then we close the business from tomorrow
 tab kya hoga
 The entire government and the opposition will stand folded together, do not do anything that is true, the country's business will stop
 yahaan tak ki adaalat ne bhi agar farmaan sunaaya, to sarkaron ke paas use ansuna karne ke alaava koi chaara nahin hoga
 Anyway, how much black money has been used in the last Lok Sabha elections, in which way dare the leader to handcuff his Bhamashah
 agar kalyugi bhamashah ko hathkadi lagi to kya ve apni ve diariyaan adaalat main nahin kholenge jinamein netaaon ko die kaledhan ke chande kaa byora hoga
 That is, the country will become an open Hamam, where even millions of suits will not cover anyone's body
 yah bahut hi nishthur sachai he
 But we must learn to live with it
 or agar ham iske saath jeena nahin siikhnaa chaahate, to hamen apni sarkaron se maang kerani chahie ki aise kanoon banaaen jo maujuuda arthtantr ke hisaab se vyaavhaarik hon
 In terms of the ultra-ideal law, the grocery shop running in your neighborhood is also illegal and you are promoting black money by taking a packet of milk without a bill from it
 isliye andolan karnaa he to vyaavhaarik vyavastha ke liye karen kaledhan ke jununee mudde ke liye nahin
 Such issues can give the opposition a chance to come to power, but the common man is not the way to progress
 jaraa sochie pichley chaar saal main andolanon kii baadh ne centre sarkaar ke haath baandh die the, desh main kaarobaar ko ghun lagane laga tha, afasaron kii kalam ruk gai thi or aapaki tankhwaah or property ke daam apni jagah jam gaye the
 If you want your progress, forget the revolution for a few days, no matter how tempting it may be
 yaa is tarah kii kranti ko kam se kam 5 saal kaa brake de dijie
 Therefore, when there is an uproar on black money in Parliament this time, before joining it, think whether you have any benefit in this entertainment or not

 The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), who is going to win the summer, got into some swear after the results of the Madhya Pradesh municipal elections
 madhya pradesh ke nagar nikaay chunaavon main congress ne bhaajapa ko kadi takkar di he or muqabla barabari par chuta he
 Both parties have got 9–9 seats
 ek seat nirdaleey ke khate main gai he
 This is not good news for the BJP
 khaskar chunavi saal main
 What is the reason for dissatisfaction in this state? Especially, it is very important to know the reason of anger among the farmers
 pichley kuch saal main madhya pradesh kii chhavi krishi utpaadan ke kshetra main behatar pradarshan karne vaale soobe kii bani he
 The state government also worked vigorously in increasing the area under irrigation
 phir bhi kisaan dukhi or niraash kyon he? pichley saal june ke maheene se hi soobe kii kisaan hitaishi chhavi ko dhakka laganaa shuru hua, jab mandsaur main kisaan andolan par utar aae the
 The police also fired on the agitating farmers
 yah maananaa galat nahin hoga ki bharat main kheti-baadi apane bure daur se guzar rahi he or isane gramin arthvyavastha ko dhakka pahunchaaya he
 Obviously, the problem of agriculture and farmers is now at the center of politics
 krishi kii in samasyaon kii vajah se hi gujarat vidhansabha chunaav main bhaajapa ko gramin siton par nuksaan uthaanaa padaa tha
 Now the average performance in the Madhya Pradesh civic elections will force the BJP to think that it is a challenge to tackle the anti-incumbency trend for three consecutive terms of Shivraj Singh Chauhan, but also to hold the rural vote after the shock of the rural economy
 Is important
 madhya pradesh main kareeb 72 fisadi gramin vot hai
 a figure shows that more than 49 percent of the farmers voted for the NDA in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 saath hi, ek tihaai bhoomihin bataaidaron kaa vot bhi endie ko hi mila tha
 On the basis of these votes, Shivraj Singh Chauhan managed to hold the anti-incumbency trend in the last two elections
 lekin unhen yaad rakhana hoga ki 230 siton vaali madhya pradesh vidhansabha main se kam se kam 60-70 siten aisi thim, jahaan bhaajapa ne thode hi antar se jeet darj kii thi
 If you look at the seats of BJP and Congress in a regional manner for the 2013 assembly elections, this difference will be visible where BJP got a slight edge
 saath hi yah bhi saaf hoga ki uttari malwa kaise bhaajapa ke majboot garh ke rup main sthapit ho gaya tha
 In 2013, BJP got a total of 165 seats, Congress 58 and others 7 seats
 madhya pradesh ke chambal ilaake main kul 34 vidhansabha siten hai jahaan bhaajapa ne 20 siten hasil kii thim or congress 12 site lekar ai thim
 But there was a difference of only two per cent in the vote share of both
 bhaajapa ko 37
 9 percent votes were received and Congress 35
 6 fisadi
 Of the 56 seats in Vindhya Pradesh, BJP got 36 seats and 39 seats
 1 fisadi vot mili the jabaki congress congress 18 siten or 33 fisadi vot hasil karne main kaamyaab rahi thi
 There are a total of 49 seats in Mahakaushal area
 yahaan vot share main donon partiyon main gaharaa antar tha
 This difference in vote share was about ten percent
 yahaan bhaajapa ne 34 or congress ne 14 siten jiti thim
 There are 63 seats in northern Malwa and 28 seats in tribal Malwa region
 in donon ilaakon main bhaajapa ko kramshah 51
 8 and 45
 8 fisadi vot mili the
 In North Malwa, the BJP won 55 seats and dominated the Congress in just 7 seats
 congress ko vot bhi 37
 8 percent met
 janajaatiy malwa main bhaajapa ko 20 siten mili thim or congress yahaan bhi sirf 7 seat hi jeet pai thi
 But it got about 40 percent of the vote
 lekin is baar shivaraj singh chouhan ke liye chunauti zyada kathin he kyonki gramin madhya pradesh kaa bada tabaka unase naaraaz he
 In particular, the marginal landless farmers and farmers with small holdings who voted for the BJP seem to be disenchanted with it
 asal main, madhya pradesh ke kisaanon kii aamadani kam barish or badalte mausam kii vajah se kharaab hoti fasalon kii vajah se pichley do saalon se kam hoti gai he
 Their condition has started to deteriorate since 2013-14 when the GDP of agriculture has shrunk to 1
 14 fisadi rah gaya or uske agle saal yah badhkar 4
 It was 6 per cent but then decreased to 1 in 2015-16
 7 fisadi hi rah gaya
 The figures now show a magical boom, when the figures for 2016–17 put the increase above 22 per cent
 iske peeche saamaanya vajah thi ki ek saal pehle ke kharaab utpaadan ke baad banpar upaj ne vruddhi ke aankade ko aasmaan tak pahunchaa diya
 But demonetisation and then GST knocked down yield prices
 aise main kisaan chaahate hai ki sarkaar unki laagat kaa dedh guna keemat dilwane kaa aashwaasan de or unke saare karj maaf kar die jaaen
 However, Shivraj Singh Chauhan is trying to contain this anger and has launched the Mukhyamantri Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojana, under which the government will directly pay the farmers who failed to sell the produce in Badajar
 phir bhi kisaan asantusht hai or aise maukey par, jab chunaav ko bahut zyada vakt nahin bachaa he, bhaajapa ko apni ranneeti ko alag nazariye ke saath taiyaar karnaa hoga
 After all, Shivraj would like to create a problem-free Madhya Pradesh for the BJP, which dreams of a Congress-free India

 That is what Modi wanted
 congress ke offis main somvaar ko har jagah bas gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi kii charchaa thi
 This is what Modi wanted
 pune main modi ne waar kiya to congress tilamila gayi or modi kii har baat kaa jawaab diya, lekin in sab main ye bhul gayi ki modi kaa jaal bhi to yahi tha, jisamen congress funs gayi
 The Congress had held a big meeting on the Food Security Bill on Saturday and it was decided that from Monday, all the spokespersons of the Congress will play the same in the country, but it was replaced by Narendra Modi
 yun to congress kii niyamit press conference chaar baje hoti he, lekin 'namo'nia se ghabaraayi congress ne subah 12 baje hi modi par hamalaa shuru kar diya
 Congress propaganda chief Ajay Maken could not even hide that the Congress has stung from the picture of Modi everywhere
 press se rubaru hone kii pehali hi line main ajay maakan bol gayi ki media ne ravivaar ko modi ko khub dikhaaya, isliye wo jawaab de rahe hai
 Maken said, "the media over anti-modi is antiheistic, so we are answering so that our point also goes
" 'ye vahi congress he jisane tay kiya tha ki wo modi ko ahmiyat nahin degi or na hi modi kii baton kaa dilli se jawaab diya jaayegaa
 It was also decided that only the Congress leaders of Gujarat would answer Modi, but Modi managed to pull the Congress on its pitch
 pich bhi gujarat kii
 The Congress repeatedly took the name of Modi and Gujarat from its own platform and turned the fight to Modi vs Congress and Gujarat vs Desh
 raatbhar congress ke netaa jaag-jagakar ankhen phaade rahe or aankade nikaalte rahe, jisamen desh or gujarat kii tulana kar saken
 On Monday, a total of 21 Congress leaders attacked Modi
 modi akele or unke mukaable puri congress
 Many leaders continued to deny Modi, but he definitely said
 shaayad soch rahe honge ki modi par bolenge to number 21 se kahin zyada ho jaaenge
 As Digivjay Singh said, we do not give importance to Modi, but Modi should clarify what his definition of secularism is
 soochna prasaaran mantri manish tiwari ne kaha ki modi raajnneeti ko sampradayik rang main baantnaa chaahate hai, taaki desh main dhruvikaran ho
 Senior Congress leaders, who had made a strategy of not giving Modi a price, were seen swearing
 kai kaa maananaa tha ki modi bhale badnaam honge, par unka naam to hoga
 Congress leaders will probably be happy that Modi has been given a strong reply, but Modi is happy that the election agenda is his own i

 Modi on one side and Congress on the other

 ) Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) is moving fast in this year's Delhi Assembly elections and it can create problems for both Congress and BJP

 yani ki ab 27 fisadi matadaata shila ko siem banate hue dekhnaa chaahate hai
 In the survey, when people were asked whether Delhi Sheila Dixit should get another chance, 65 percent people said 'no', while about 33 percent people talked about giving them another chance
 haalanki do fisadi logon ne is par apni koi raay nahin di
 The survey said that Kejriwal, who is trying his luck in Delhi Assembly elections for the first time, could be fatal for the Congress as 21 percent of the party's voters can vote for AAP
 vahiin, bijepi ke 32 fisadi voter apana najariya badalakar kejariwal kii aap ke paksh main matdaan kar sakate hai

 Standard SMS Charges Applicable (input ieenes se) Supreme Court has refused to send a five-judge bench to 1994 Ismail Farooquimalamay, who is associated with Ayodhyama's nativism
 pradhan nyaayadhin deepak mishra, justise ashok bhushan or justise abdul nazeer kii teen jajon vaali bench ne yah faisla 2:1 (paksh-vipaksh) ke hisaab se diya he
 Chief Justice Dipak Misra and Justice Ashok Bhushan remained unanimous in the case
 justise ashok bhushan kii taraf se donon jajon ke faisle ko padhaa gaya
 The big things that went in favor of the decision are: 1
 1994 ke ismail faruki banaam bhartiya sangh maamle main 'masjid main namaaj padhanaa dharm kaa abhinn ang nahin he' ko lekar kii gai tippanee kaa sandarbh bhoomi adhigrahan ke sandarbh main tha
 Therefore, the comment in para 52 of this judgment needs to be understood in that context
 2
 In the Ismail Farooqui case, exemption such as reference to the 'comparative importance' of the place of prayer is said only in relation to acquisition
 3
 The comments made in the Ismail Farooqui case will not affect the decision to decide ownership in the Ayodhyamamale case
 4
 The Ismail Farooqui case does not need to be sent to a larger bench for reconsideration
 justise abdul nazeer ne rakhi alag rivahin aaj ke faisle main shaamil justise abdul nazeer ne chif justise deepak mishra or justise ashok bhushan se alag raay rakhi
 He said that what is required from the point of view of religion was concluded in Ismail Farooqui case without any comprehensive test
 is maamle main jo tippanee andeh ke ghere main thi use hi aadhaar maanakar elahabaad hoicourt ne ramajanm bhoomi maamle main apana faisla sunaaya tha
 Therefore, it is necessary to look at the Ismail Farooqui case in the light of the 1954 Shirur Math case
 bataa den ki paanch jajon vaali bench ne is cese main kaha tha ki kisi dharm kii sahi practice kya he ye usee dharm ke log hi tay karenge na ki koi bahari agency tay karegi
 What is Ismail Farooqui case? In Ayodhya, the kar sevaks demolished the Babri Masjid on 6 December 1992
 iske baad centre sarkaar ne 7 janvari, 1993 ko adhyadesh laakar ayodhya main 67 acre jameen kaa adhigrahan kar liya tha
 Under this, 120x80 feet of disputed land was also acquired which is called Babri masjid-ram Janmabhoomi complex
 centre sarkaar ke isi faisle ko ismail faruki ne supreme court main chunauti dete hue apni yachika main kaha tha ki dharmik sthal kaa sarkaar kaise adhigrahan kar sakati he
 Hearing this, the apex court had said that offering prayers in the mosque is not an essential part of Islam

 aadhikarik sutron ne bataaya ki sarkaar ne shuukravaar der raat jaankaree di ki ayog kaa pratinidhimandal ab bharat nahin jayega
 He said that the delegation of the Commission had gone to Lahore on Friday to go to India, but the tour was canceled at the last moment
 yah yatra radd karne kaa koi kaaran nahin bataaya gaya he lekin sutron kaa maananaa he ki ipel ke liye nilaamee main pakistan ke kisi bhi khilaadi par boli nahin lagaae jane se pakistan main paidaa hui vyapak naaraazgi kii vajah se yah kadam uthaaya gaya he

 Rossi was liked before and still remains

 Maharashtra, Haryana and Jharkhand will be elected in the coming months, states have registered objection to the move of the Narendra Modi government
after the implementation of the new Motor Vehicle Act from September, all the challans are being cut across the country
 ek maamle main to jurmaana ek lakh 41 hajaar rupee tak pahunch gaya
 But this move has created fear in those states in which elections are due in the coming months
 maharashtra, haryana or jharkhand aise hi rajya hai, jahaan motor whical act ke khilaaf sur uthne lage hai
 The governments of these states say that the amount of fine is very high and it should be reduced
 rajya sarkaron ko dar he kahin centre sarkaar kaa trephic vyavastha sudhaarney vaala daanv unki sarkaar par baari na pad jaae
 Therefore, Maharashtra's Devendra Fadnavis government has written a letter to Union Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari to reduce the amount of fine
 vahiin jharkhand sarkaar ne nae motor whical act main sanshodhan karne ke sanket die hai
 Transport Minister CP Singh believes that the fine is too high
 unhone logon ko bharosa dilaayaa ki keval do din intjaar karen kyonki piem narendra modi yahaan honge or ek din baad khaas satr bulaayaa jayega
 He said that the penalty amount will be reviewed for breaking registration, polution and other rules
 jab parivahan mantri se poocha gaya ki rajya main chunaav hone vaale hai aise main kya raghubar das sarkaar ke liye nayaa motor whical act pareshaani khadi kar saktaa he? jawaab main unhone kaha ki ham logon ke hiton ke liye chintit hai
 Soon the penalty amount will be softened
 chunaav kii aahat ke bich maharashtra sarkaar ne bhi jurmaana raashi kam karne kii maang uthaa di he
 State Transport Minister Diwakar Rawate has asked to reconsider the heavy penalty amount in the letter
 unhone centre sarkaar se guhaar lagaai ki jurmaana kam kiya jaae
 The government says that the fine is out of the public's control
 itnaa jurmaana log nahin bhar sakate
 However, Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar has also shown a soft attitude in this matter
 unhone kaha ki 45 dinon tak logon ko trephic ke nae niyamon ke bare main jaagruk kiya jayega
 However, when asked that the provisions of the new Motor Vehicle Act will be relaxed like other states
 is par unhone kaha ki 70-80 fisadi log bina chaalaan ke maanane vaale nahin hai
 They are constantly violating the rules
 lekin chunavi saal main logon ko naaraaz karne kaa risk khatter bhi nahin lenaa chahenge
 It is clear from the attitude of the states that he will not want to bear the burden of heavy penalty on the people in the election year because angry people can also close the door of power in the states for the governments

 a total of 36 Indian players have won $ 8,61,000, while the total amount received by foreign players is $ 7,64,000
 inamen vishwa ke number van khilaadi malaysia ke lee chong ve par sabase zyada 1,35,000 dollar kii boli lagaai gai
 This amount is $ 48,000 more than the amount paid to Holland's player Teun de Nouijer who plays in the Hockey India League
 ve hockey india lig ke sabase mahange khilaadi the, jin par 87,400 dollar kii boli lagaai gai thi
 Similarly, Saina's price is $ 42,000 more than the captain of Indian hockey team Sardar Singh
 sardaar singh kii keemat 78,000 dollar lagaai gai thi
 Even Sindhu's price was $ 2,000 more than Sardar Singh
 lekin ipiel se iskaa koi muqabla nahin he
 Australian all-rounder Glenn Maxwell was picked up in IPL for $ 1 million in last year's auction and India's Ravindra Jadeja was the highest bidder at $ 2 million
 baharhaal ibl ne badminton ko ek peshewar khel bana diya he, jahaan paisa or shoharat donon hai
 Even the new and not yet recognized players are getting a lot of money
 paison ke lihaaj se dekha jaae to badminton bharat main cricket ke baad duusare number kaa khel ban gaya he
 It has also overtaken the national game of hockey
 ibl ke aayojak sports solutions ke siio ashish chaddha ne india today se kaha, ''badminton aisa khel he, jahaan bhartiya khilaadi lagaataar acha pradarshan kar rahe hai
 Apart from Saina, we have 7 such players, who come in the top 30 players
 is prakaar yah desh main duusare number kaa khel ban gaya he
 "saina, the number three player in the world, believes that this league will give a boost to the badminton in the cricket crazy country
 is samay vishwa championships kii taiyaari main juty sina kahati hai, ''ibl ke kaaran desh ke yuvaaon ko badminton khilne kaa protsaahan milegaa
 i have always been saying that money is necessary to play well at the international level
 ”lekin vishwa dubles main 21wein number kii khilaadi 29 varshiya jwaala gatta or 2010 ke rashtramandal khelon main swarna padak jeetne vaali 19wein number kii khilaadi 23 varshiya ashvini ponppa kaaphi naaraaz thim kyonki aayojakon ne frenchygiyon ke kehane par unki nunatam keemat 50,000 dollar se ghataakar 25,000 dollar kar di
 Amending the format made it clear that the franchisees had no interest in women's doubles
 ve sirf ekal khiladinnon or purushon ke dubles ke hi paksh main the
 Jwala said angrily, "it is very humiliating to reduce the player's cost of a women's doubles to half due to playing in mixed doubles
" unhone itani bhi sajjanta nahin dikhaai ki ve hamen pehle hi is bare main bataa dete
 "despite this, it is believed that IBL will give a lot of encouragement to the game and because of this, Indian players will get an opportunity to play with and against the best players of the world and the country
" sina or sindhu kisi bhi pratiyogita main ab tak ek-duusare ke khilaaf nahin kheli hai
 But it is expected that he will get such an opportunity at least twice in IBL
 isse nae khiladinnon ke man se bade khiladinnon ke khilaaf khilne kaa dar bhi dur ho jayega kyonki toornament main ve ek-duusare ke kareeb aa sakenge
 Like IPL, it also has a lot of glamor attached to it
 dilli smashars ke maalik krish samooh he, ne sania mirza ko apana brands ambesder banaaya he
 South Indian films actor Nagarjuna is with the Mumbai franchise
 sunil gavaskar iske brands ambesder banaae gaye hai
 It is believed that Gagan Narang, who won the bronze medal in the Olympics, will promote the event
 afvaah yah bhi he ki bollywood star aamir khan or prakaash padukon kii beti deepika padukon ko toornament ambesder banaaya ja rahaa he
 Mohit Burman, who bought the Pune franchise, and the Sahara family who bought the Lucknow franchise also own IPL teams
 ummid he ki ve maichon main kai cricket khiladinnon or film stars ko bhi lekar aaenge
 These players will also be seen in radio jingles, TV promotions, ramp shows and page 3 events as the organizers are busy promoting it loudly
 jaahir he isse khiladinnon ko jaani-pahachaani hasti kaa darja mil jayega
 Put net, love boost slogan It seems that IBL wants to spread this game to the common people
 aalochakon ko thodaa andeh he, lekin ibl main safal hone kaa jaruri masala bharaa hua he—paisa, glamer vaale maalik, joardaar prachaar or badminton ke khel kaa standard or uski lokapriyata badhaane kaa vaastavik prayaas
