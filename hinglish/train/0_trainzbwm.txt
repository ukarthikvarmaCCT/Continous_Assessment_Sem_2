 BJP MP Meenakshi Lekhi had said in her petition that Rahul Gandhi linked the statements of the Supreme Court to politics
 haalanki is maamle main rahul gandhi ne bina shart maafinama bhi daakhil kiya tha, lekin adaalat ne tab unhen koi raahat nahin di thi
 The Supreme Court while commenting on the petition had said that no such statement has been made by the court
 saath hi chif justise kii bench ne saaf kar diya tha ki court aisi tippanee kar hi nahin saktaa he
 What arguments did the two sides make in the Supreme Court? In the Supreme Court, Rahul Gandhi was advocated by Senior Advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi
 vahiin, minakshi lekhi kii tarah se senior edwocket mukul rohtagi court main daleel pesh kii thi
 He demanded the court to reject Rahul Gandhi's apology and take action
 senior vakil mukul rohtagi ne kaha tha ki court se do baar daant khaane ke baad rahul gandhi ne teesraa halafanama daakhil kar apane bayaan par court se bina shart maafee maangi he
 Rohatgi had said that Kirahul Gandhi has apologized too late and as per the earlier Supreme Court verdict, the late apology cannot be accepted
 unhone kaha tha ki wo rahul gandhi kii maafee kaa virodh karte hai
 Supreme Court should take action against them and punish them
 rohtagi ne kaha tha ki rahul gandhi ko jail bheja jaae yaa ninda yaa penalty kii sajaa di jaae yaa phir rahul gandhi ko saarvajanik rup se maafee maangane kaa aadesh diya jaae
 At the same time, Rahul Gandhi's lawyer Abhishek Manu Singhvi had said that Rahul Gandhi had initially admitted his mistake in the first affidavit and also regretted the court
 aisa unhone court se avmaananaa notice jari hone ke pehle hi kar diya tha
 Singhvi said that Rahul Gandhi has made no delay in apologizing or admitting a mistake and the court should accept his affidavit and close the contempt case against him
 supreme court ne faisla kiya surakshitchif justise ranjan gogoiki adhyakshata vaali teen sadasyeey peeth ne daleelein sunne ke baad rahul gandhi ke khilaaf daakhil minakshi lekhi avmaananaa yachika par faisla surakshit rakh liya tha
 Now the Supreme Court is going to give its verdict in this case

 Taking forward the same news after two groups of the Indian Army published the movement in January on Wednesday, creating a stir in political circles, the Indian Express newspaper on Thursday claimed that the defense secretary Shashikant Sharma and the three armies were involved in the case only yesterday

 This news printed on the entire page of Indian Express caused a lot of uproar
 haalanki ab akhbaar bhi maan rahaa he ki sena kaa koi galat iraadaa nahin tha, lekin uskaa daawa he ki is halchal main kuch tha, jo kaayadon ke khilaaf tha, kyonki sarkaar ne bhi khufia soochna milte hi lukout alert jari kar diya tha
 But some questions have also arisen from this whole news
 jab fouj dilli kii ore sena kii tukadiyon ke badhane ko routine kavayad bataa rahi he, to us par sarkaar ke haath−paanv kyon phool gaye the
 The most important question now is whether the government felt that there was a conspiracy behind it
 
 
 or agar aisa laga, to kyon laga
 The comments enditivi india ko sena ke sutron se mili jaankaree ke mutabik aisi kavayad aam he, jo har do−teen maheene main ek baar hoti he
 The danger of any danger from these small squads is meaningless, but the question is why the government made special sense of this common routine
 kya isliye, kyonki haal hi main senapramukh or sarkaar ke bich kai baar takaraav dikhaai die
 Apart from the controversy related to Senapramukh's date of birth, a controversy came up about him being offered a bribe, another controversy over the weak preparation of the army
 
 
 or is bich ek ahm sawaal yah uthaa ki aakhir senapramukh kii pradhanmantri ko likhi chitthee kisne li kii
 It was probably also the effect of all these disputes that the army appeared shaken and the government moved

 or is bich ek ahm sawaal yah uthaa ki aakhir senapramukh kii pradhanmantri ko likhi chitthee kisne li kii
 It was probably also the effect of all these disputes that the army appeared shaken and the government moved
 is bich, angrezi dainik indian express ke sampadak shekhar gupta ne enditivi se baatcheet main kaha ki sena kii do tukadiyon ke dilli kii ore badhane kii khabar par ve kaayam hai, or unhen apni khabar par puraa bharosa he
 The dispute started on Wednesday when the Indian Express published the news that on the night of 16 January, two important troops of the army were moving towards Delhi without the knowledge of the government, which caused the government to panic
 indian express ke puure panne par chhapi is khabar se joardaar hangaamaa ho gaya tha
 Although the newspaper now believes that the army had no ulterior motives, it claims that there was something in this movement, which was against the Quaidas, as the government also issued a lookout alert as soon as intelligence was received
 lekin is puri khabar se kuch sawaal bhi khadey hue hai
 When the army is telling the routine exercise to increase the troops of Delhi towards Delhi, then why did the Government's hands and feet thrive on it
 sabase ahm sawaal ab yah he ki kya sarkaar ko aisa laga ki iske peeche koi saazish he
 
 
 And if it did, then why
 tippaniyan According to information received from army sources, NDTV India is such an exercise, which happens once every two-three months
 in choti tukadiyon se kisi khatare kii baat bemaani he, lekin sawaal he ki is aam routine ke sarkaar ne khaas matlab kyon nikaale
 Is it because recently, there have been several confrontations between the army chief and the government
 senapramukh kii janmatithi se jude vivaad ke alaava ek vivaad unhen rishwat kii peshkash kiye jane ko lekar saamne aayaa, ek anya vivaad sena kii kamazor taiyaari ko lekar hua
 
 
 And meanwhile, an important question arose as to who leaked the letter written to the Prime Minister of the Army Chief
 yah shaayad in sabhi vivaadon kaa bhi asar rahaa ki sena hili or sarkaar hilti dikhi
 This news printed on the entire page of Indian Express caused a lot of uproar
 haalanki ab akhbaar bhi maan rahaa he ki sena kaa koi galat iraadaa nahin tha, lekin uskaa daawa he ki is halchal main kuch tha, jo kaayadon ke khilaaf tha, kyonki sarkaar ne bhi khufia soochna milte hi lukout alert jari kar diya tha
 But some questions have also arisen from this whole news
 jab fouj dilli kii ore sena kii tukadiyon ke badhane ko routine kavayad bataa rahi he, to us par sarkaar ke haath−paanv kyon phool gaye the

 -2002 ke grahamantralay ke aadesh main kaha gaya he ki dilli sarkaar ko kisi bhi nae kanoon ke prastaav ko up−rajyapal ko bhejnaa hoga, jise up−rajyapal grih mantralay ko bhejenge
 Delhi Jan Lokpal Bill needs President's approval
 -'aap' sarkaar ne vidhansabha kaa vishesh satr bulaakar kendra kii andekhi kii he
 Delhi is a Union Territory and as per Article 239 a of the Constitution, the decision of Parliament will be applicable to the Legislative Assembly
 -sansad pehle hi lokapal bill paas kar chuki he or rajya sarkaar maujuuda kanoon se alag koi bill nahin laa sakati
 According to constitutional experts, aap's move is unconstitutional, as Delhi already has a Lokayukta

 He will be seen in this film alongside Keerthi Sanon
 apane parivaar ke dwaara kisi film main nahin lene ke sawaal par tiger ne kaha, meri maa produsar thim
 He never thought about it

 kya aam aadmi party ke rashtriya sanyojak arvind kejariwal ko apni zimmedaari or kaam dusron par shift kar dena chahie? aam aadmi party ke varisht netaa kumaar vishwaas ne enditivi india ko die intervyuu main kaha ki kai baar kejariwal overloded ho jate hai, unako apana kaam dusron par shift kar dena chahie
 When Kumar Vishwas was asked if you think Kejriwal is still right for the post of national convenor of the party, he said, "I think the party is going ahead under his leadership and he is ahead of us in this matter
" wo first amang equals hai
 Now they too are human beings, they too have their own abilities, their own strengths
 kai baar overloded ho jate hai
 They shift their work, give the work to the people
 wo dete rahete hai or usapar ham log vichaar vimarsh karne vaale hai kal yaa parason main
 "comments kumaar vishwaas se ye sawaal isaliye puche ja rahe hai kyonki charchaa chal rahi he ki ek ke baad ek haar ke baad kya kejariwal ko ab rashtriya sanyojak kaa pad chhod dena chahie or kumaar vishwaas rashtriya sanyojak bane
 In response to this question, Kumar Vishwas said, "I don't think so
 arvind rashtriya sanyojak isaliye nahin bane hai kyonki hamane kaha unako ki ban jaao yaa PAC ne kaha ki ban jaao, balki saare kaaryakartaaon ne unase kaha ki aap ban jaao
 We are all involved in this
 aapane ek chunaav prakriya or ek samay tay kiya or kaha ki ban jaao to wo ban gaye
 " haalanki kumaar vishwaas ne party netaaon ke apane padon se die istife par sawaal uthaate hue kaha, 'istifa dena koi hal nahin, istipha inhen logon ne lenaa inhen logon ne dena he
 Today, did Sanjay bhai, Durgesh or Dileep resign from their posts and break away from this process? They are sitting together too
 ab kuch baaten kar rahe hai, kuch or jagah kii soch rahe hai, dilli kii soch rahe hai, baahar kii soch rahe hai, gujarat me kya karen, rajasthan main kya karen? communication kaise sudhaaren? to ye roller coster karne kii kya aavashyaktaa he ki tum is vaali kursi se isapar baith jaao phir is vaali par baith janaa
 i say if we have learned a lesson from our defeat, then more than any resignation, and if we have not learned a lesson, then resign together, all is fraud
 " These questions are being asked to Kumar Vishwas because the discussion is going on whether Kejriwal should leave the post of National Convenor and become National Convenor after one defeat
 is sawaal ke jawaab main kumaar vishwaas ne kaha, "mujhe nahin lagata
 Arvind has not become the national convener because we asked him to become or the PAC said that he should become, rather all the workers asked him to become you
 ham sab isamen isliye sammilat hai
 You set an election process and a time and said that if they become, then they become
 " However, Kumar Vishwas questioned the resignation of party leaders from their posts and said, 'resignation is not the solution, it is these people who have to resign
 aaj sanjay bhai, durgesh yaa dilip apane pad se istife dekar is prakriya se alag ho gaye kya? wo to saath hi baithe hai naa
 Now we are talking some things, thinking of some other place, thinking of Delhi, thinking outside, what to do in Gujarat, what to do in Rajasthan? How to improve communication? So what is the need to do this roller coaster that you sit on this chair and then sit on this one
 meraa kahana he agar hamane apni haar se sabak siikhaa he to wo kisi bhi istife se zyaada or agar sabak nahin siikhaa to saare milakar bhi istife de do, sab frodbazi he
 " haalanki kumaar vishwaas ne party netaaon ke apane padon se die istife par sawaal uthaate hue kaha, 'istifa dena koi hal nahin, istipha inhen logon ne lenaa inhen logon ne dena he
 Today, did Sanjay bhai, Durgesh or Dileep resign from their posts and break away from this process? They are sitting together too
 ab kuch baaten kar rahe hai, kuch or jagah kii soch rahe hai, dilli kii soch rahe hai, baahar kii soch rahe hai, gujarat me kya karen, rajasthan main kya karen? communication kaise sudhaaren? to ye roller coster karne kii kya aavashyaktaa he ki tum is vaali kursi se isapar baith jaao phir is vaali par baith janaa
 i say if we have learned a lesson from our defeat, then more than any resignation, and if we have not learned a lesson, then resign together, all is fraud

 chini vaigyanikon ne kritrim tareeke se bandaron ko taiyaar kar badi kamyaabi hasil kii he
 Scientists used the same technique to prepare it, which was used nearly two decades ago to prepare a sheep named Dolly
 jhong jhong or hua hua naam ke 2 african langur kritrim tareeke se taiyaar kiye gaye hai
 To prepare these, mammal monkeys, apes and human things were mixed
 inkaa janm 6 se 8 hafte pehle hua
 Their clones were prepared from non-embryonic cells
 is puri prakriya ko somatic cell newclear transfar (SCNT) ke jariye kiya gaya jisase cell ko garbh main bheja gaya tha
 The Shanghai-based Chinese Academy of Sciences Institute of Neuroscience says that this work will prove to be such a boon for medical research on prevention of diseases caused by monkeys
 donon navjaat bandaron ko bottle ke jariye doodh pilaayaa ja rahaa he or unka vikaas saamaanya tareeke se ho rahaa he

 iske liye unhone kai prayaas kiye
 However Robin lowell-baez, who had mastered clone preparation at the Francis Crick Institute in London, who was not involved in the task with the Chinese team, says it is too ineffective and the process was too dangerous

 In many villages of Gujarat for two years, many people have seen a woman trying to reach the echo of 'pani hai to jeevan hai, save water jaan bachao'
 uskaa uddeshy tha ki agar hamaare purakhon ne talab banaae the uskaa raaj yahi tha ki talab ke sangrahit jal se jalastr nicha nahin jayega or jameen ke neeche behate pani ko ham aanevaali peedi ke liye bachaa saken
 The farmers who introduced water to the fields by turning on the switch through modern borewells showed women power even before they could understand something, after seeing a woman build a pond in Banaskatha, Gujarat in just two years, people were left staring
 gujarat ke suukhaagrast jilon main pani sahejane kaa kaam kar rahi mittal patel kaa ek hi makasad he- har gaanv main talab banvaanaa
 Which she has been doing continuously since 2017, ie for two years
 yah kahani lagbhag dhai saal pehle gujarat ke banaaskantha se sharu hui thi
 Mittal joined a campaign to save water and reached a village
 mittal ke mutabik, wo jab vahaan pahuchin to chaaron or sookhaa padaa tha, lekin kheton main bharpoor pani tha
 Every farmer had his own borewell
 jitne paise, jameen main utana hi gaharaa borwell
 a farmer laid a pipe down 13 hundred feet
 mittal ne bataaya ki maine samajhaana chaha ki borwell hameshaa kaa hal nahin
 In this way, the ground water will end every day
 sunne waalon par koi asar nahin hua
 Then i referred to the generations to come that if we use all the water, what will our future generations do? i see that it has little effect - why don't we get the ponds dug in your village
 shuruyaat main tamaam gaanv ke log hansane lage or log ulta mujhe samajhane lage ki aaj ke jamaane main talab koun karata he
 i did not give up my efforts
 After a few days the people of the village agreed to get the pond excavated, but the problem was behind Mittal because the dilemma here was that it is the government's job to dig the pond and keep it 'maintained'
 ve kisi bhi tarah se talab main yogadan dene ko taiyaar nahin the
 The villagers flatly refused to invest the money
 mittal ne yahaan bhi logon ko samajhaayaa ki hamaare paas simit sansaadhan hai ham jesibi lagaayenge
 You will extract the soil but you have to give the truck to remove the soil, but they were not willing to pay a rupee
 phir hamane kaha- tractor bhi ham laga denge
 All you have to do is arrange food for the workers
 jabaki mittal ne 2017 se hi jal bachaane kii apni muhim ched rakhi he, jin gaanvon main talab khudaai chalati he, vahaan mittal puure mishan tak hajiri detii thim
 First the soil is extracted from the JCB, removed from the tractor
 mittal ne borwell or talab rakshit pani kaa bhed samajhaayaa unhen yah bhi bataaya ki aapke bacchon ke paas ye bhi nahin hoga
 Finished underground water cannot be returned by money
 mittal maanati hai ki hamaare purakhe lanbaa sochate the
 The work of constructing the pond began in the village to collect pond water
 ve ek-duusare se jude hue the
 If the water of a pond overflowed, it would reach from third to third
 ab ke log sochate hai- pani kam ho rahaa he to jameen kuch feet or gahari khod dete hai
 This is the reason that water used to get water after digging 40 feet, while now it is dry even after going 150 feet deep
 mittal kii yah mehnat rang laai, ab jaakar log pani ko lekar chintit hue hai jahaan-jahaan talab khudwaaye gaye hai, gaanvvaale use bharne kii koshish kar rahe hai
 In many villages, Panch-sarpanches took the initiative themselves and got the ponds filled through the Narmada pipeline
 bahut si jagahon par talab ban to chuke hai, lekin barish kaa intjaar kar rahe hai
 Mittal now has a long list of villages that want to build ponds, if you want to build a pond
 gaanv ke sarpanch ab talab khudwane aage aae hai or mittal ke is kaary ke prashansak bane hai

 ) After registering two big wins on two big teams, Team India is now in front of an opponent whose weakness can neither be explored nor whose strength can be judged
 worldcup main yuai jaisi team harati rahi hai or jis group main bhi inhen shaamil kiya jaataa he unamem inaki haar kii bhavishyavaanee bhi pehle hi kar di jaati he, lekin worldcup kaa itihaas ye bhi kahata he aisi timen kisi bhi din match kaa pasa bhi palat sakati hai
 Therefore, the team management does not want to make the mistake of taking the UAE lightly
 is match se pehle aaiye jaanate hai kyon ye match hoga khaas
 In Perth's economy, India has won 4 matches so far and has lost 6
 ek match taai bhi rahaa, lekin phir bhi adwantage team india ko hi he, kyonki yuai kii team ne perth main aaj tak ek bhi muqabla nahin khelaa he
 However, India were limited to just 200 runs against England in the tri-series played last month
 us siries main vaaka maidan kii aniyamit oochaal ko lekar bhi kaaphi baaten huin
 It is believed that the mood of the pitch will not change much
 worldcup main kabhi nahin bhide bharat-uaiteam india ke paas 874 van-de maichon kaa anubhav he to yuai ke paas keval 20 maichon kaa
 In the World Cup, India has played 69 matches till date, while UAE has only 7, but in the World Cup till date, both have not collided
 isse pehle bharat or yuai sirf do baar aamane saamne hue hai
 Once in Sharjah in 1994 and the second time in 2004 in Dambulla and on both occasions, India won a big win
 bharat banaam bhartiyauai kii team main aise do khilaadi he jo naa sirf bhartiya mul ke hai, balki bharat ke gharelu cricket main kaaphi samay tak sakriy bhi rahe hai
 The first is Swapnil Patil, who has played cricket for Mumbai's under-14, under-16, under-19 and under-22 teams
 yahi nahin team india ke ballebaaj ajinkya rahane ke saath to unhone gharelu cricket kii kai badi saajhedaariyaan bhi kii hai
 Not getting much chance in India, Patil went to Dubai to work
 jahaan unhen cricket khilne kaa mauka phir se mil gaya
 The second player of Indian origin in the UAE team is Krishna Chandran Karate
 krishna chandran bhi dinesh karthik, robin uthppa, stfort binni or es srisanth jaise khilaadiyon ke saath maidan main utar chuke hai
 Krishna Chandran, who played in Kerala U-19 team, also shifted to Dubai due to lack of much opportunity in Indian cricket
 jahaan club cricket main unhone apana naam banaaya
 Both these players are very hopeful of getting a chance against India
 maidan par ghamasanbhartiya team ne pakistan or dakshin africa donon ke khilaaf 300 yaa usase zyada kaa score kiya he or is baar bhi bhartiya team ko bada score banane kaa mauka mil saktaa he
 On the other hand, UAE batsmen are also seen in color
 ireland or zimbabwe donon ke khilaaf yuai ke ballebaajon ne 275 se zyada kaa score khadaa kiya or donon hi maichon main saamne vaali team ko sangharsh karne par majaboor bhi kiya
 Apart from this, the UAE team is also performing tremendously in bowling and fielding, in such a situation, Team India will need to be careful
 choti tiimon ke bade recordakhri or iklauti baar bhartiya team agar kisi associat team se worldcup main haari he to wo thi srilanka kii team jisane 1979 worldcup ke ek mukaable main bharat ko 47 ran se haraa diya tha
 The history of the World Cup is replete with matches where small teams have chewed the big teams
 1996 world cap main kenya ne westeindies ko maat di to 1999 worldcup main zimbabwe ne bharat ko patkhni di thi
 Kenya defeated Sri Lanka in the 2003 World Cup, while India played a semi-final against Kenya
 2007 vishwacap main ireland ne pakistan ko haraakar sansani failaa di thi to 2011 worldcup main england ko pani pilaa diya tha, is worlcap main bhi ireland ne westeindies ko patkhni de daali
 Team India recognizes this danger very well and hence Team India would like to enter this match with full force

 Generally, eggs are kept in the fridge in the homes of all of us
 lagbhag har frij main andon ko alag se rakhane ke liye spes bhi bana hota he
 But according to a recent study, scientists have claimed that it is not safe to keep eggs in the refrigerator
 vaigyanikon ne apni is baat ke samarthan main kuch tark bhi die hai
 Before we know about the new beliefs, it is necessary to clarify one thing that the eggs kept in the fridge remain fresh for longer than the eggs laid out and their taste also remains due to being fresh
 baavjood iske vaigyanikon ne apane tarkon se saalon se chale aa rahe is chalan ko galat bataaya he
 1
 tapamanagar aapkande kaa istemaal baking product banane ke liye karnaa he to behatar hoga ki use frij main na rakhen
 Whipping eggs in the refrigerator is relatively difficult to beat
 jisase rang or swaad donon main fark aa jaataa he
 2
 tuutane kaa dabgar aapane dhyaan diya ho to kharidkar laane ke baad aap agar turant hi andon ko ubalane ke liye rakhte hai to ve footte nahin hai lekin frij main rakhe andey ko ubaalane main uske footne kaa dar hameshaa zyada hota he
 3
 bacteria kaa khatarande ko frij main rakhane ke baad use saamaanya taap par rakhane par condenseshan hone kii ashanka bad jaati he
 Condensation can increase the speed of bacteria present on egg shells and increase the chance of penetration
 aise andey kaa seven karnaa khatarnaak ho saktaa he
 4
 sankraman kaa khatraakai baar andey ke upree bhaag par gandagi rah hi jaati he to frij kii duusari chizon ko bhi sankramit kar sakati he
 In such a situation, keeping the eggs in the refrigerator can be a risk of many infections
 5
 It is true that eggs kept in the fridge last longer than the eggs laid out, but due to too much cold in the fridge, some of the nutritive eggs of the eggs are destroyed
 kamare ke taapmaana par rakhe andey, frij main rakhe andon kii tulana main kahin adhik sehatmand hote hai

 After the defeat in the Lok Sabha elections, Priyanka has become even more active in politics
 ab wo apni aawaaj ko pehle se bhi zyada mukhar tareeke se uthaa rahi hai chaahe wo dharaatal par ho yaa soshal media par
 If we talk about social media, Priyanka has surpassed her brother Rahul Gandhi in this matter
 india today kii data intelligence unit ne 1 march 2019 se lekar 20 july 2019 tak rahul or priyanka gandhi ke twitor data kaa vishleshan kiya or paaya ki priyanka gandhi ab bad chadhakar soshal media platform par apni aawaaj buland karti najar aa rahi hai jabaki rahul gandhi pehle se ab kam sakriy ho gaye hai
 She was not so active on Twitter during the election
 kya kehete hai aankade?priyanka gandhi ne chunaav ke thik pehle farvari main twitor par acount kholaa
 He made his first tweet in March
 march ke maheene main unhone kul 18 twits post kiye
 He tweeted 16 times in the month of April and 8 times in May
 loksabhaa chunaav khatm hone ke baad ve phir sakriy huin or june ke maheene main unhone 18 baar twit kiya
 As of July 20, Priyanka has tweeted 38 times
 vahiin duusari taraf unke bhai rahul gandhi ne march main 47 twit post kiye the jo april main badhkar 54 ho gaye, or tab se ab tak ve lagaataar gire hi ja rahe hai
 He tweeted 45 times in May, 24 times in June and by July 20 he posted only 12 tweets
 rahul phir bhi hai zyada popularpriyanka gandhi chaahe rahul se zyada sakriy ho gai hai lekin unke bhai ab bhi twitor par unase zyada lokapriy hai
 The average re-tweet received by Rahul Gandhi's tweets is much higher than that of Priyanka
 aisa isliye he kyonki priyanka gandhi or rahul gandhi ke foloverj main jameen aasmaan kaa antar he
 Priyanka Gandhi has about 6 lakh followers on Twitter, while her brother Rahul has a little over 1 crore followers - almost 20 times more than Priyanka
 phir bhi fark saaf hyaankadon ke saath-saath donon hi congress netaaon ke twit karne kaa andaaj alag-alag he
 Priyanka mostly tweets in Hindi
 unke kul 98 twits main se 70 fisadi hindi main hai or baaki angreji main
 Only 27 percent of Rahul Gandhi's tweets are in Hindi, 71 percent in English and the remaining 2 percent in Tamil, Malayalam and Marathi
 iske alaava priyanka gandhi twitor par rashtriya or sthaneey pratispardhaon ko pramot karti najar aati hai
 Especially from Uttar Pradesh
 ve kai khabaron ke link ko bhi post karti hai jinke madhyam se wo yogi sarkaar ko janata kii samasyaon kii ore dhyaan dilaati hai
 Last week, Priyanka Gandhi made a lot of headlines when she was taken into custody by the Yogi government in Mirzapur
 priyanka sonbhadra main hue narsanhaar ke peedit parivaar waalon ko milane ke liye nikali thim
 They demonstrated a lot of protest against this and in the end they considered meeting the victims' family
 unhone apane rosh ko twitor par abhivyakt kiya or saath hi saath parivaar waalon se hui unki mulaakaat kaa ek video bhi daalaa
 Rahul Gandhi's Twitter handle appears to be mostly focused on the central government, Prime Minister Modi and the BJP
 apni bahan kii hi tarah, ve bhi sthaneey tallent ko pramot karte hai, lekin aisa kabhi kabhi hi hota he
 Rahul Gandhi was unhappy with Twitter users when he made a mockery of the Army's Dog Squad on International Yoga Day
 unhone yoga karne kii koshish kar rahe army dog squad kii photo twit kii jise ‘new india’ ke capshan ke saath twit kiya tha
 Overall, it can be said that Priyanka is currently trying to support the sinking Congress

 The court said that there is no need to reconsider it and gather data
 ek tarah se sheersh adaalat ne 2006 ke emnagarajamaamle ko kaaphi had tak barkaraar rakhaa he
 However, the Supreme Court has said that it is not necessary for the state governments to collect data related to the backwardness of SC / ST class and their share in employment

 Whereas in Nagraj case, the court had made a condition that before reservation in promotion, it has to be seen whether there is insufficient representation

 The court had said that there can be no tampering in the list issued on the orders of the President regarding SC-ST and only Parliament can make changes by making laws
 essi / asti samudaay ko milane vaale pramotion main aarakshan kii sanvaidhanik vaidhata ko em nagaraj ne supreme court main chunauti di thi
 In 2006, in the case of m Nagaraj vs Union of India, a Constitution Bench of five judges of the Supreme Court had ruled that Article 16 (4) of the Constitution for SC / ST (SC-ST) sections in promotion to government jobs
 And reservation can be given under 16 (4B), but for this the government has to fulfill certain conditions
 sheersh court ne tab yah bhi aadesh diya tha ki essi-asti virgon ke liye pramotion main rigerveshan dene se pehle sarkaar ko iske liye yah aankada jutanaa hoga ki samaaj kaa yah tabaka kitna pichhadaa rah gaya he or sarkari naukariyon main inkaa pratinidhitiv kitna he or agar inako pramotion main aarakshan miltaa he to is pahal kaa sarkaar ke kaamkaaj par kya fark padegaa
 Despite the decision of the Supreme Court, many state governments continued to give reservation in promotion without collecting data
 isi aadhaar par 2010 main rajasthan hai court ne rajya main essi / asti samudaay ko milane vaale pramotion main aarakshan par roak laga di
 After this, in 2011, Allahabad High Court also quashed the Uttar Pradesh government's decision of reservation in promotion
 iske baavjood upi kii tatkaaleen mukhyamantri mayawati ne dalit samudaay ko pramotion main aarakshan diya tha
 However, the SP government, which came to power in UP in 2012, pulled out SC / ST community from reservation in promotion
 iske baad madhya pradesh sarkaar ne bhi pramotion main aarakshan par roak laga di thi
 After this, these people of the Dalit community came to the Supreme Court, on which a historic decision has come
 court ne saaf kaha ki rajya sarkarein chahen to pramotion main aarakshan de sakati hai, lekin iske liye aankade dena jaruri nahin he

 Supreme Court will give verdict at 12: 30 AM, verdict on Ayodhya case today, all schools and colleges in UP will remain closed karnataka main kumaraswami sarkaar kaa sankat badhata hi ja rahaa he
 11 mlas of the jds-congress coalition government reached the Speaker's office to resign on Saturday and submitted their resignations
 vidhayakon ke is kadam ke baad mukhyamantri echdi kumaraswami kii sarkaar khatre main dikhaai de rahi he or sarkaar gathan ko betaab bijepi ke liye rasta aasaan hota najar aa rahaa he
 Actually, Karnataka has a total of 224 assembly seats, requiring 113 mlas for a majority
 philhal bijepi ke 105 vidhayak hai
 While Congress has 80 mlas and JDS has 37 mlas
 is tarah se donon ke paas kul 117 vidhayak hai
 Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and Independent mlas are also supporting the alliance
 haalanki pichley dinon congress ke do vidhayakon ke istipha dene or ek vidhayak ko nishkasit kiye jane ke baad congress ke vidhayakon kii sankhya 77 rah gai he
 The number of congress-jds is 114
 vahiin, bijepi pehle se hi daawa kar rahi he ki congress ke 6 or jedies ke 2 vidhayakon kaa gupt rup se samarthan mila hua he, jo jald hi istipha denge
 The BJP is hoping to form a government in the state and is constantly making claims for it
 jedies-congress ke vidhayakon ke istife se kumaraswami kii mushkilen bad rahi hai, lekin bijepi abhi sarkaar banane kii sthiti main nahin he
 This is the reason why BJP is running silent operation Lotus, so that a situation arises when Kumaraswamy comes down with majority and BJP claims to form his government
 gauratlab he ki oparation lotus ke jariye bijepi 2008 main bhi karnataka main sarkaar banane main safal rahi thi
 At that time BJP came out winning 110 seats out of 224
 aise main bahumat ke aankade ko chune ke liye bijepi ne oparation lotus kaa istemaal kiya tha
 Eight mlas of Congress and JDS had resigned from the membership of the assembly citing personal reasons
 iske baad in sabhi 8 netaaon ko bijepi ne apane chunaav chinh par vidhansabha upachunaav ladaaya tha, jisamen se paanch bijepi se jitkar aae or teen haar gaye the
 In this way BJP had crossed the magic figure of majority
 is baar bhi agar bijepi kii ranneeti safal rahati he to kumaraswami kii aguwai vaali congress-jedies sarkaar ke liye aane vaale din mushkilon vaale sabit ho sakate hai
 The Modi government is seriously considering that if mps do not work in the house, then the matter of no salary or no work should be implemented on them
 11 rajyon ke 111 saansadon ne is par sahmati jataai he, khaas baat he ki inamen saat kendriya mantri bhi hai
 Union Minister Dr
 Mahesh Sharma says that when a laborer does not work, he is not paid salary, then why cannot this apply to mps
 dow
 Sharma says this when the functioning of the two houses of Parliament is not getting equal since last 21 July, then mps like them see no other way
 tippaniyan But Congress MP Sushmita Deo, who is opposing the government, says, if they have a government today, give salary or else we will continue our protest

 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley also said that such suggestions have come to the government and this should be discussed
 philhal saasadon ko har maheene 50 hajaar vetan milte hai or har din kaa bhatta do hajaar miltaa he
 If one day work is not done in Parliament, then there is a loss of about eight crore rupees and neither the ruling party nor the opposition is ready to take responsibility for it
 kendriya mantri doctor mahesh sharma kehete hai ki jab ek majdoor kaam nahin karata he to use vetan nahin diya jaataa he to phir ye baat saansadon par kyon nahin lagu ho sakati
 Dr
 sharma ye baat tab kehete hai jab beete 21 july se sansad ke donon sadanon main kaamkaaj nahin ke baraabar ho rahaa he, to phir un jaise saansadon ko doosraa koi rasta nahin najar aata
 The comments lekin sarkaar kaa virodh kar rahe congress kii saansad sushmita dev kahati hai, aaj unki sarkaar he to wo selary de yaa nahin ham to apana virodh jari rakhenge
 The leader of the Aam Aadmi Party, Bhagwant Mann, says, 'his party absolutely agrees that there is no work, not salary, but not now, it has to be implemented retroactively so that what the NDA did in Parliament during the UPA regime also came to the fore

 Currently, the Rajya Sabha has been adjourned till 2 pm due to the uproar
 tippaniyan However, after the announcement of BSP supremo Mayawati's resignation from the Rajya Sabha on Tuesday, it is believed that the path to her return to the Rajya Sabha will not be easy
 darasal, mayawati kii rajyasabha sadsyta 2018 main samaapt hone vaali thi
 He does not have the required figures to return after that
 is baar upi vidhansabha chunaav main basapa ko mahaj 19 siten mili hai
 Due to these, Mayawati's return is not possible

 However, some time ago, Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) of Bihar had announced that it would support Mayawati in the Rajya Sabha candidature
 unke samarthan kii badaulat sambhavatya mayawati 2018 main rajyasabha main laut sakati hai

 kehane kaa matlab yah he ki jis tarah 'bajrangi bhaijan' kii shooting ke dauraan salmaan khan kashmir kii beauty ko tasveeron ke jariye pramot karte najar aae the

 Then how many coincidences? Death of the witness one by one first
 phir police suraksha milane ke baavjood haadase ke vakt police kii gaiyr-maujuudagi
 The police argued that there was no place for the policemen to sit in the car
 jis trek ne gavaahon ke car ko udaaya uske number plate par kaalikh kaa puta hona
 The driver runs away after the accident
 phir haroonges taur par kuch der baad uskaa giraftaar ho janaa
 There is no doubt that the accident on the road can happen to anyone at any time
 bahut mumkin he, ye haadasa bhi haadasa hi ho
 But the story has so many twists from the beginning
 police, mulgim, ilzaamon, dhamkiyon, sabooton or gavaahon ke pal-pal badalte chehre or sazishon kaa taana-bana ho, vahaan shaq paidaa hona lazimi he
 And the police should doubt most about this accident
 par sawaal ye he ki upi police is haadase ko sachmuch shaq kii nigaah se dekh bhi rahi he yaa nahin? The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is going to review its interest rates today and the indications are that now interest rates will not go up

 In Chhattisgarh, there has been a political uproar in the state on the front page of the 'deargai witch' of the Bharatiya Janata Party mouthpiece 'deep Kamal'
 rajya ke mukhya vipakshi dal congress ne ise ochhi maansikta kaa parichaayak kaha he, vahiin bhaajapa ne congress par hi aarope madhte hue ashishnutaa kaa aarope lagaaya he
 The song 'sakhi Saiyan' from Aamir Khan's film 'peepli Live' is very good, the price is expensive
 ’ kaa yahaan jamkar raajnneetik istemaal ho rahaa he
 In Chhattisgarh, this 'inflation witch' has created a lot of trouble
 rajya main ‘deep camel’ ke naam se prakashit hone vaali masik patrika ko bhaajapa kaa mukh patr mana jaataa he
 The publisher and printer of the magazine is Rajesh Munat, the state's urban administration minister and BJP leader Subhash Rao is the editor of the magazine
 is patrika kaa july ank chhapakar pichley dinon baahar aayaa or isi ke saath hi vivaad bhi saamne aa gaya
 Actually this controversy is related to the cartoon on the front page of this magazine, which has a picture of a witch with a claw imprint tilak on it and it has a 'deargai witch khay jaat hai' written in it
 yahi nahin is cartoon main pradhanmantri manmohan singh, vitt mantri pranav mukherjee or krishi mantri sharad pavaar kaa bhi chitra bana hua he
 The common man is burdened with inflation
 patrika ke sampadak subhash raav apane sampadakeey main mahangaai ke liye congress ko jeebhar kosa he
 Congress leaders have described it as a symbol of the mindset of the BJP
 rajya vidhansabha main vipaksh ke netaa ravindra choube kehete hai ‘patrika ko dekhne se lagata he ki bhaajapa manhagaai kii sari jimmedaari congress par thopane kaa prayaas kar rahi he or isamen chapa cartoon ochhi maansikta kaa pratik he
 'chaubey says that the way the cartoon is made is a sign of mental disorder and bankruptcy
 isaki keval ninda kii ja sakati he
 At the same time, other Congress leaders termed it as a matter of contempt and said that the registration of such a magazine should be canceled
 chhattisgarh pradesh congress cameti ke pravaktaa ramesh valryani kehete he ki is patrika ke madhyam se loktantric mulyon kaa hraas kiya ja rahaa he tathaa aisi patrika kaa panjikaran radd kiya janaa chahie
 Valrayani says that it is also a matter of contempt and the party has kept the option open
 patrika ko lekar rajya main raajnneetik ghamaasan machane ke baad bhaajapa ne aarope lagaaya he ki congress is mudde ko lekar anaavashyak vivaad paidaa kar rahi he
 BJP state vice president Sachchidananda Upasane says that the Congress, which failed to curb the price rise, is trying to get rid of the original issue by creating unnecessary controversy
 upasne kehete hai ki ‘deep camel’ ke july ank main kisi kii bhi avmaananaa nahin kii gai he
 Rather, from the perspective of a cartoonist, there has been an attempt to put inflation at bay
 yah afsos kii baat he ki congressi is had tak ashishnu ho gaye hai ki saamaanya loktantric evam rachanaatmak dhang se rakhe gaye vishay ko bhi bardaasht nahin kar paa rahe hai
 Love can happen anyway

 Total deposits are not safe anywhere, when does the love of God (wherever this part of the house is!) Climb? So the answer is when gifting them teddy bears
 ladki ko tedi bear dena is baat kii nishaani he ki ab aapke pyaar kii gaadi phul throtal par daud padi he
 There was a time when love was like doing phd
 research paper taiyaar karne kii tarah naam-pataa, pataa karte tak main usee kii shaadi kaa card aa jaaya karata
 If you read the love story of twenty-five-year-old Majnu, the most prominent page will look the same when Majnu, who had read 'chiranjeev Ramsalone with good luck Laila' in the wedding card, first came to know Laila's name
 kismat ke dhani hue to kisi saheli ke jariye baaten shuru ho jaati or lau letters ke jariye pyaar kii lau jalaai-bujhaai jaati
 The roses would have been exchanged secretly in books, but today Propose on Facebook, Iqrar on whatsapp and Free Nightcalls 'and Sunao' "you Tsunao" have disappeared between pages
 mohabbat karnaa yel uniwarsity se degree lene jaisaa ho gaya he
 Weekends come and go, they don't even know, so the delivery of teddy bear works as a milestone
 ladakiyon kaa relationships states to chat karte vakt banati-bigadati unki mukhaakriti dekhakar bhi bataaya ja saktaa he, par ladakon kaa tabhi pataa chalata he jab kaan main yearphone khonse chat par yaa haath main bada-sa tedi liye giftshop se baahar nikalate dikh jaaen
 See a girl getting a teddy bear, its reaction is like if the doctor has put oxygen on the patient between the outstretched breaths
 tedi moh dekhakar soch main pad jate hai ki iske bina ye ab tak jivit kaise thi? taduparant namakaran bhi dekhie to pataa chalegaa kanya main netanyahu se lekar shi jingping tak nivas karte hai mandarin, hebrew yaa german, french, italvi jin bhashaaon kaa naam bhi na suna ho us kisi bhashaa se shabd laakar tedi ko ek naam de diya jaataa he
 It is not known who started the practice of giving teddy as a gift to girls, but who also saved millions from wearing shoes, otherwise it would have gone half the age to know the choice and half the age to sort the choice
 tedi kaa upyog tab samaj aata he jab baat karte-karte gussa aane par uski pitayee ho jaati he
 Girls love teddy bears because they can't pull your ears all day
 kanya kii maa ne rasoi main jaale bhi jhaadne ko kah diya to shikaayat tedi se, atyaadhik umadane vaale pyaar se lekar selfi kii bauchhaar yahaan tak kii brallep kaa dukh bhi tedi ko jhelana padataa he or antat har baar ladakon kaa pyaar, tedi par atyaachaar sabit hota he

 bhaajapa ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah ne isse inkaar kiya ki dilli chunaav jeetne ke liye kiran bedi ko 'boro player' ke taur par laayaa gaya he
 He did not attach importance to the allegation that Bedi had asked the leaders of the 'india Against Corruption' movement to take a soft stand towards the BJP

 When Shah was asked about the controversy arising out of the allegation that Kiran Bedi had asked the leaders of the 'india Against Corruption' movement to take a soft stand against the BJP, he said that India Against Corruption is not an 'aam Aadmi Party' 
 shah ne kaha, 'vah ek utkrishth police adhikari rahi hai, jinhone puraa jivan bhrashtachar ke khilaaf ladaai ladi he
 The BJP is with everyone who has fought against corruption
 jise bhi bhrashtachar ke khilaaf ladaai main vishwaas he or bhaajapa main shaamil hona chaahate hai un sabhi kaa swagaat he
 He said that Kiran Bedi has joined BJP on the same lines and the people of Delhi have faith in them and they have faith in the women of the country for special women security and their coming will strengthen the BJP
