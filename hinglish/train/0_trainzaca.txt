 isibi ne kaha ki yah unke vakil dwaara taiyaar kiya gaya gopneey email he
 In the email, "at the end of the first Test, Pietersen was given a gift by the team in the joy of his 100th Test
" apane bhaashan main kevin ne kaha tha ki england dressing room kaa maahaul isse behatar kabhi nahin tha
 Important things of the leaked document
 
 
 november 21-25, 2013ashes siries kaa pehla test match khatm hone ke baad england team ne kevin petersan ko 100waan test khilne ke sammaan main ek gift diya
 During this time, Peterson had said that the atmosphere of the England dressing room was never better than this
 november 29-30, 2013endi flower ne team ke khilaadiyon ko der raat tak hotel se baahar rahane se manaa kiya
 Also asked to refrain from making conflicting statements in the press conference
 lekin petersan nahin maane
 He went to the pub with two young players and continued drinking late into the night
 edilade ke ek akhbaar main agle din unki tasviir bhi chhapi
 Before the Perth Test on December 13–17, 2013, the England team's physio told coach Flower that Kevin Pietersen had told him that if England lost 3–0 in the series, they would like to go home
 fijio ke mutabik petersan ne unase kaha tha ki vah iske liye ghutane main chot kaa bahaanaa banaaenge
 December 26–30, 2013 Coach Flower suggested Alastair Cook to call a team meeting after the fourth Test loss
 is meeting main team management kaa koi bhi sadsy maujuud nahin hone vaala tha
 When Pietersen was asked about the meeting, he told Matt Prior and other players, "I have no interest in this meeting
" ' ek pari main jaldi out hone ke baad vah dressing room main aakar yuva khilaadiyon ke saamne gaali galoch karne lage
 December 30, 2013 - January 3, 2014 Andy Flower has a meeting with Kevin Peterson in his hotel room
 is baithak main petersan ne kaha ki cook ek kamjor, takneekee taur par asaksham or ghatiya captain hai
 In this meeting, he played ill with Flower and questioned the coaching
 saath main swaan or team ke anya khilaadiyon ko bhala-bura kaha
 January 3-7, 2014 When Peterson was going to the dressing room after being dismissed in the second innings, he was going to whistle in a very casual style
 match haarane ke baad vah dressing room se nikle or kaha, i don't give a f***tour ke dauraan aksar hi team meeting main kevin petersan kaa dhyaan kahin or rahata tha
 He would either watch outside the window or his watch would be his watch
 wo yah sab tab karte, jab coach flower or team ke anya khilaadi kuch bol rahe hote
 Peterson, however, dismissed the email saying, "I heard about it
" yah kaaphi sharmnaak he
 They could not even write the correct spelling of Cook's name
 yah majaak he
 i don't even want to think about it

 What Satyagrahis of Mathura annihilated in one day is too heavy for the police to digest

 In the Navagrahas, Brihaspati is considered the master and the mentor
 pilaa rang, swarna, vitt or kosh, kanoon,dharm,gyaan,mantra,brahman or sanskaron ko niyantrit karata he
 The digestive system in the body determines the duration of Maida and age
 paanch tatwon main akaash tatva kaa adhipati hone ke kaaran iskaa prabhaav bahut hi vyapak or viraat hota he
 The entire responsibility of marriage in the life of women is decided by Jupiter
 kya hota he jab brihaspati kaa bura asar vyakti par padane lagata he ?- brihaspati ke kamjor hone se vyakti ke sanskaar kamjor hote hai
 Along with hindrance in learning and wealth, a person has difficulties in getting the support of elders
 - vyakti kaa pachan tantra kamjor hota he,cancer or liver kii sari gambhir samasyaayein brihaspati hi detaa he
 - Problems on the child side also cause problems, sometimes there are no children at all
 - agar brihaspati kaa sambandh vivaah bhav se ban jaae to vivaah hona asambhav ho jaataa he
 - An inauspicious position of Saturn can solve a person's problems, but it is very difficult to get rid of the ill effects of Jupiter
 kaise karen brihaspati dev kii aradhana ?- brihaspativaar ko praatah snaan karke pile vastra dhaaran karen
 - Sit in front of Jupiter Dev's picture or banana plant
 - dhoop batti or deepak jalaaen,chane kii daal or good kaa bhoga lagaaein
 After this, chant the mantras of Jupiter according to need
 - mantron kaa jaap haldi yaa rudraksh kii maala se karen
 - Eat a diet of yellow things on Thursday, but under which conditions should you chant the mantras? - jab brihaspati ke kaaran swasthya kii samasya ho to tab " graan green groun sah guruve namah" kaa praatah or siankal donon vela jaap karen
 - When there is a problem of sacraments due to Jupiter, in such a situation, chant "om Devpoojitaya Namah" in the morning - When Jupiter has problems with children, then chant "om Angirasayya Vidmahe Divyadehay Dheemhi Tanno Jeeva: Prachaodayat" in the morning

 The central government has given a big gift to the farmers of the country by substantially increasing the minimum support price (MSP) of all 14 kharif crops including paddy, millet, maize, arhar, moong and ragi
 piem modi ke is faisle se jahaan kisaanon ko phayda hoga, vahiin bijepi ke liye bhi loksabhaa chunaav ke saath-saath pashchim bengal, andhra pradesh, uttar pradesh, punjab, tamilnadu
 In states like Haryana, Bihar, Karnataka, Gujarat and Chhattisgarh, it will be easy to woo farmer voters

 Many opposition leaders including Congress President Rahul Gandhi are trying to prove the Modi government as anti-farmer

 Earlier, the MSP of paddy had recorded a record increase of Rs 155 per quintal in a year, which was done by the UPA government in 2008-09 a decade ago
 yani modi sarkaar dwaara kii jane vaali 200 rupee kii badhotaree ab tak kii sabase badi badhotaree hogi
 The special thing is that the Manmohan government also increased the MSP in the last year of his first term of UPA-1 and in the next year, he got a lot of votes in the elections, Modi government has also adopted the same formula at least on time
 congress ne 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav main jab apni sarkaar bachaane main kamyaabi pai to usamen kisaanon ke vot ahm maane gaye

 emspi main badhotaree se pehle modi sarkaar ganna kisaanon ko raahat dene ke liye 8,500 karod rupee ke package kaa elaan kar chuki he
 This decision is being seen as a masterstroke given the upcoming Lok Sabha elections and the assembly elections in three states this year

 During pregnancy, you are advised to take many precautions so that both you and the baby in your womb are protected
 aapako yah bhi dhyaan main rakhane kii jarurat he ki aap pregnancy period main kya khaaen or kya naa khaaen, kya eksrasij karen or jaruri supplements lete rahen
 However, apart from all this, there are some things in which carelessness can prove to be harmful
 aaie jaanate hai pregnancy ke dauraan kin chizon se aapako or aapke bacchon ko nuksaan pahunch saktaa he
 
 
 1- Stay away from harmful smells - The smell of many things can harm your child
 agar aap khud ghar kii deevaaron par paint karne ja rahi hai to ruk jaaie kyonki yah aap par bura asar daalata he
 If there is painting in any part of the house, then stay away from that place
 paint se nikalne vaale kuch padaarth pregnent mahilaon ke liye nuksaandaayak sabit hote hai
 Avoid inhaling them
 2-garm pani se nahaana- aapke bachche ke liye thik nahin-agar garm pani se nahaakar aapako relax mahasoos hota he to thodaa thahar jaaie
 Although there is nothing to fear in bathing with hot water, it is possible that the body temperature reaches 101 degrees and your blood pressure may fall
 aisa hone par aapke bachche ko jaruri poshak tatv or oxigen kii kami ho sakati he
 The Organization of Teratology Information Service (OTIS) suggests that pregnant women should try to keep their body temperature below 101 degrees
 3-falon ke zeus kaa atyadhik seven-yah sunakar bhale hi aapako hairaani ho lekin falon kaa zeus pregnent mahilaon ke liye acha nahin hota he kyonki isamen sugar kii maatra bahut zyada hoti he
 It is better to eat fruit than fruit juice because the quantity of sugar in the juice is high and fiber is low
 isse blad sugar kaa str bad jaataa he
 Consumption of fruit juice in large quantities can cause gestational diabetes
 4- peeth ke bal sona-pregnancy ke dauraan sone kii sabase sahi pojishan bain karavat sona he
 However it can be a bit difficult for you and if you want to change your position, you can do so
 lekin ek baat dhyaan main rakhen ki peeth ke bal sone se bachein
 When the pregnant woman lies on her back, the entire weight of the uterus falls on other parts of the body
 isse blad cirkulation bhi bighad saktaa he
 Sleeping on your back can also cause respiratory problems
 5- skin care products-aap apni skin par jo kuch bhi lagaati hai, vah sharir dwaara avashoshit kar liya jaataa he or iskaa prabhaav aapke bachche par bhi padataa he
 During pregnancy, these chemicals should be specially avoided - salicylcic acid, retinoid and benzyl peroxide
 apane beauty product kharidne se pehle ek baar uske ingrendients jarur check kar len

 guuruuvaar ko mumbai main ek kaarykram main pahunche rashtriya swayan sevak sangh pramukh mohan bhagwat se jab padmavat par ho rahi hinsa par sawaal poocha gaya to unhone chuppi saadh lee
 When the Aaj Tak correspondent asked this issue question, instead of answering, Mohan Bhagwat put a finger on his mouth and kept silence
 bataa den ki bhagwat mumbai main bombai stock exange main bijnes kshetra main rashtriyata or athiks mudde par sambodhan dene aae the
 Karani Sena has raised questions on silence
 It is a matter of fact that just a few days ago, the national president of Karni Sena Sukhdev Singh Gogamadi also questioned the silence of Mohan Bhagwat and Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 gogamadi ne kaha tha ki supreme court ke bain hataane ke baad bhi padmavat kaa virodh jari rahegaa
 The BJP is showing cynicism on Padmavat
 unhone smriti irani ko gherte hue ki sensor board soochna env prasaaran mantralay ke antargat aata he
 Which is under the BJP government at the Center
 agar bijepi sach main film ko bain karnaa chaahati to ab tak kar chuki hoti
 Mohan Bhagwat said here that we have been fighting the enemies for the last several years, due to which there is loss of public wealth
 mohan bhagwat bole ki aaj bhi ham apane aapako samajhane ke liye videshi granthon ko padhate hai, khud ke granthon ko nahin padhate hai
 Bhagwat said that competition is right, but taking angry wrong decisions cannot make India a superpower
 unhone kaha ki pichley 500-700 saal main aakraamak islam se bhi ladate hue hamaare desh kaa vaibhav kam nahin hua
 Bhagwat said that despite fighting the British, our country's GDP has been in the top 5
 aaj bhi bharat peeche nahin he, bharat duniya kaa sarvapratham desh he
 But the definition of the first has changed
 jise dekhte hue ham kehete hai ki hamaara desh peeche he
 In the program, Bhagwat said that we are still lost in tune, we have to take direction
 hamaari sahi disha kya he
 We have started seeing the world with the eyes of foreigners
 unhone kaha ki abhi tak jo chalata aayaa he usee disha main badhenge aisa nahin he
 Bhagwat said that the trade going on will bring the values of foreigners
 or galat beemaari aegi
 We should not be afraid of this, foreign trade will have to be exchanged
 hamen bina bhay ke sabhi ko apnaanaa hoga, nirbhay banakar janaa hoga
 Also addressed in Guwahati, let me tell you that even before this, Mohan Bhagwat had targeted Pakistan in Guwahati last week
 is baithak main RSS pramukh mohan bhagwat ne padosi mulk par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha tha ki bharat to pakistan ke saath apni sari shatruta bhul gaya, lekin pakistan ne aisa nahin kiya
 He said that as long as Hindutva flourishes, India will continue to exist
 purvottar ke teen rajyon tripura, meghalaya or nagaland main chunaav se kuch dinon pehle hi sangh pramukh ne guwahati main baithak ko sambodhit kiya
 He said that there was conflict, Pakistan was born
 bharatvarsh 15 agast, 1947 se hi pakistan ke saath shatruta bhul gaya lekin pakistan ab tak nahin bhuulaa
 This is the difference between Hindu nature and the nature of another
 bhagwat ne kaha tha ki mohenjodaro, hadappa jaisi pracheen sabhyataa or hamaari samskruti jin sthanon par viksit hui, ab ve pakistan main hai

 Read an interesting piece of literature on Aaj Tak, why are you so afraid of death Surendra Mohan Pathak *** My Sunil series novel 'pakistan Ki Hasina' was printed in the 'popular writer' of September 1970, which i named 'operation Pakistan'
 was kept
 lekin prakaashak mahendra sharma kii sanak thi ki usne mujhe bina bataae upanyaas kaa naam badalakar 'pakistan kii hasina’ rakh diya tha jabaki naam ko sarthak karne vaali koi hasina upanyaas main thi hi nahin
 In 1970, James Bond's new-fifth novel 'operation Bangkok' was also published, which i had written for Kalpana Pocket Books, a publisher in Meerut, and in a way spoiled a script
 uske baad us prakaashak se meraa kabhi vaasta nahin padaa tha
 Today i do not even remember who he was, what his name was or where his office was in Meerut
 jaisaa ki maine peeche arj kiya, san 1970 main, oktober ke maheene main, mere pita ko teesri baar dil kaa daura padaa
 He was immediately rushed to Dr
 Sen's nursing home at ITO
 aisi dushwariyon ke un dinon aaj sareekhe angeoplasty, bypass surgery, open heart surgery jaise fancy ilaaj nahin the
 Angiography was also not practiced yet
 tab khaali isiji hi ek test tha, aaj jiske bare main heart specialist kehete hai ki khaas kuch bhi nahin bataata, or ilaaj yahi tha ki khun patala karne kii goli khao, khan-paan main parhez lao, pathadin kaa injection lo or rest karo
 That is, if someone had a heart attack, then his or her fate was due to his / her fate, which could lead to good or bad results
 taees oktober kii shaam ko mere pita nursing home ke apane kamare main meri maan se baaten kar rahe the ki balb kii tarah fus ho gaye
 Half of the talk was uprooted and half was still in the mouth that the hereafter had gone
 baad main maaloom padaa ki jo un par beeti thi, usko heart atake nahin kehete the, heart phelior kehete the, madical science kii jubaan main myocordial infarction kehete the
 The owner of the house went, leaving some clothes and two pairs of shoes behind
 'chaar rotiyaan ek langoti’ vaala mizaaj to unka nahin tha, phir itane material bhi nahin the ki ghar main jidhar nigaah uthati, unka aks ujagar karti koi shay dikhaai de jaati
 His costumes, shoes were like Ghalib, like 'chand Tasveerebutam Chand Khatutin'
 uparokt ke vipareet jab farjand-e-pannalaal us anjaam ko pahunchega to gharavaalon ko peeche choda uskaa tamzam sanbhaalanaa dubhar ho jayega
 However, it was my first meeting with death
 meraa puraa ek saal deewangi kii haalat main gujara
 Every moment i used to think that i just died, just like my father did
 bhukh-pyaas ud gai, raat ko neend aana band ho gaya
 By then, i had become a master of sip, yet i did not have the courage to get close to whiskey
 jaise-taise aphis jaataa tha to lagata tha ki bas main hi mar jaaounga
 Many times the situation was such that the road got off the middle, sat on the pavement, felt himself capable, then returned home and went to the doctor, who was aware of my feelings, because even before i used to visit him
 wo mere ko koi goli-voli de detaa tha or samajhaata tha ki sab cycolagical tha, mujhe kuch nahin hua tha
 i used to think, i used to go to office, but i used to work somehow but when i returned home in the evening, then i started to panic, the doctor explained everything seemed to be false
 gharavaale, khaas taur se meri maan, meri babat bahut phikramand the
 The doctor was aware of the father, when she used to go to him in connection with me, he used to give her the same answer that everything was psychological, it would be cured on its own
 lekin thik to na hua
 Many times at two o'clock in the night i felt such nervousness and agony as if the next breath was not going to come
 doctor kareeb hi, do blaak pare rahata tha
 With great difficulty, he used to get up from sleep and grinned, coming home to meet his father's friendship, and was given an injection of morphine
 saath hi sakht hidaayat karke jaataa tha ki main sirf vaham kaa shikaar tha, ainda kabhi raat ko use na bulaayaa jaae
 i had an experience of that doctor's mood in the past as well
 hamaare kirayedar kii chaar bacchon kii maan bivi ko koi migraine jaisi sirdard kii alamat thi jisaki vajah se wo kabhi bhi ekaek tadapane lagati thi
 That doctor was aware of the tenant because he used to write accounts for it and used to fill his income tax return
 is mulahje main wo bivi ko dekhne aata tha or koi immergency upachaar karke jaataa tha
 Once, such a visit occurred to the wife around eight o'clock in the evening
 kirayedar ne apane bade ladke ko doctor ke paas daudaya jisane usko ye aashwaasan dekar lautaa diya ki thodi der main aata hoon
 But he did not come
 phir kirayedar khud dauda gaya
 He returned the same answer to him that i will come in a while
 saare ilaake kaa iklauta embibies doctor tha isliye kirayedar kisi duusare, laisar doctor ke paas nahin janaa chahta tha
 After all, when the doctor came, wife was dead from brain hemorrhage
 paanch maheene kii dudhmunhi-chauthi aulad-bacchee ko chhodkar
 i saw the condition of the tenant that it seemed that he would die along with his wife
 dahaaden markar rota tha, diwaar ko takkaren martha vilaap karata tha—''hai, main luttya gaya, loko! ‘’darun drishy tha, dekhakar dil hilta tha
 The ashes of the wife's funeral pyre had not cooled that the sister-in-law had got married - not even silently, she was tied in a fog, tied a sword in the waist! How fleeting was the grief, depression, weeds, sorrow of the separation of the mother of four children from her wife! As today, private nursing homes were not flooded, so it was very difficult to find a doctor to attend if any medical emergency was standing at night
 kareebi sarkari hospital ervin tha jo ki dilli get par tha lekin aadhi raat ko marij ko vahaan pahunchaae jane kaa koi jariya hasil nahin hota tha
 So there was no option but to wait for morning
 main sari raat jaagta tha or ghar ke tamaam membran ko bhi jagaata tha
 During the day, the mother used to go to the doctor, the doctor explained to him that he could not get up from bed at two in the night and come again and again for home visit
 phir usne karnaa kya hota tha? khaali ek injection hi to dena hota tha! ghar kaa koi janaa injection lagaana sikh le, use bulaane kii jarurat hi nahin rahegi
 At the same time, at four o'clock in the evening, an hour before the holiday, i started feeling like i was having a heart attack
 mere hosh ude dekhakar meraa ek mechanic apane scooter par bithakar mujhe ervin hospital le gaya
 When i saw that situation there, i was admitted for observation
 maine mechanic ko kaha ki wo mere ghar khabar kar de ki main raat ko ghar nahin aauunga lekin ye haragij na bataae ki main hospital main bhartee tha
 "pathak sir," the mechanic enthusiastically assured me - "you don't panic
" aapako yahan jitne khun kii jarurat hogi, main doongaa
 "" Thank you
 abhi ja, phone kar
 "he went on assuring me still
 wo anpadh tha, main use samajhaata bhi to wo nahin samajhane vaala tha ki meraa cese- agar wo cese niklaa- khun dene kii jarurat vaala nahin tha
 He does not know how he repeated the news on the phone that no one in the house believed him
 usase jid karke poocha gaya to usne bol diya ki main ervin hospital main bhartee tha
 One of my brother-in-law reached the hospital at night
 wo doctor se mila to maaloom padaa ki isiji kiya gaya tha jo ki bilkul thik paaya gaya tha, mote taur par nahin lagata tha ki mujhe koi alamat thi
 The night i slept in the hospital ward and got home in the morning and returned home
 meri maan or bahanen mere se aise milin jaise main jang ke muham se jinda vaapis laut aayaa tha
 Mother used to cry
 pati kii maut kaa gam to abhi kam hua nahin tha, maine ek nai dushwari khadi kar di thi
 Biwi was pregnant, two sisters were non-married, so what would have happened if i had anything! However, i was very much shocked by the shock, the family members were also persecuted a lot
 phir jaise ekaek wo vipatti mere par tuuti thi, vaise hi ekaek peechha chhod gai
 What happened, how it happened, was nothing short of a miracle
 bas, karta kii kerani hui, 'miti dhundh jag chanan hoya’, pehle jaise ekaek mujhe lagane laga tha, main mar jane vaala tha, vaise hi ekaek ab lagane laga ki mujhe kuch nahin hua tha, main purnataya swasth tha
 One thing of that era surprises me a lot
 us bure haal main main naval kaise likhata rah sakaa?meri us ek saal kii dimagi haalat ne mere upanyaas lekhan main avrodh paidaa kiya hona chahie tha lekin meraa ricard bataata he us dauraan bhi maine badastoor likhaa tha, oktober 1970 se oktober 1971 ke bich ke ek saal ke vakphe main mere aath nae upanyaas chape the!health ke bare main vaham kaa shikaar main hameshaa se tha- aaj bhi hoon- health sambandhi choti-si baat ko magniphai karke dekhnaa meri aadat ban gai thi
 There was a slight stomach upset, it hurts a little, i used to think there was an ulcer, a little cough did not go well, i thought there was tuberculosis, a little breath, i felt asthma, i lost weight, i used to think that cancer had lifted my head
 Had been
 inhen vahamon kaa maaraa main doctor-dar-doctor bhatakta tha, jaanboojhkar waakif doctor ke paas nahin jaataa tha ki ghar par khabar pahunch jaaegi
 Many unwary doctors cached my baseless fear in their own right, conducted unnecessary tests, fed non-essential medicines
 ek doctor jaraa bhala maanas tha, usne do took kaha- ''pathak sahab, jaisi bimariyon kaa shikaar apane aapako samajhate ho unamem se ek bhi sach main aapako hoti to aapaki kab kii chal-chal ho chuki hoti
 You are safe, attentive sitting in front of me, this is the proof that you do not have any disease
 ''ames main itiai kaa lagaaya hajaar line kaa internal exange tha jisaki dekhbhaal ke silsile main main aksar vahaan jaataa rahata tha
 Once i went to the section where the ECG used to be
 oparator itiai ke technician ke taur par mujhe jaanata-pahachaanata tha isliye jab maine use apana isiji karne ko kaha to bina huzzat usne isiji kar diya
 When i asked about the result, he said that there was little fault
 akl se kaam letaa to doctor se kansaltesan kii farmaaish karata jo tareeke se, tafasil se mujhe bataata ki kya nuks tha or kya wo mujhe nuksaan pahunchaa saktaa tha
 Instead of doing this, instead of returning to ITI, i went to Bara where my wife had gone
 maine bivi ko isiji ke bare main bataaya or nidhaal dewan par pad gaya
 When the wife spoke to her mother, the mother immediately called an informed doctor — whose name was Pannalal — to the house
 wo ilaake kaa mashhoor doctor tha, umradraj tha, khud omprakash sharma kaha karte the ki agar unke aadhe bachche aaj jivit the to doctor pannalaal kii vajah se the- usne isiji dekha, meraa muyna kiya or jhidakkar bolaa- ''uth ke baith
 Nothing happened to you ''main hadabadaakar uthaa
 "hey, educated boy, i don't even understand that if there was a serious flaw in your ECG, would such a huge hospital allow you to go home?" "but," "I said in a dazed voice
" The ECG operator used to say
 
 
 xxrep 4 ' koun kahata tha? xxrep 4 ' isiji oparator
 "" Who is above the doctor, right? Regarding the heart, who has more knowledge than a doctor, right? ”I could not speak my mouth
 ''wo ediyat oparator tha
 His job was to operate the machine, not to give his opinion about the ECG result
 isiji ko study karnaa doctor kaa kaam tha or apni kwaliphoid raay dena bhi uskaa kaam tha
 "" "no defect in ECG?" i muttered
 ''he maamuli kharabi lekin wo vidin aseptid paramiters he jo ki idial condishans main isiji na kiya jaae to kisi ke isiji main bhi dikhaai de sakati he
 i have come here on the call of your mother-in-law, now if my ECG is done then it will show much worse than yours, whereas i have no difficulty in my heart, my heart is strong like a horse
 samajha kuch?''maine sahmati main sir hilaayaa
 The undeserved person was killed
 ab uth or daud phir
 Then i came to know about my life

 pandey ne bataaya ki eme kii padhai ke dauraan unhone 'bluemfield' kii ek kitaab padhi thi jisamen unhone dekha ki arabi, farsi, german or french, sabhi bhashaaen ek duusare se mil rahi he
 Pandey said that Persian and Sanskrit languages meet each other a lot, so they did not have much trouble in understanding its diversity
 german bhashaa kii jaankaree ke liye bhi unhone kai kitaab padhe
 Badri Narayan told that he had conceived this dictionary long ago, but could get the work of bringing it in original form only after retirement
 pandey kaa janm ek behad hi saadhaaran parivaar main bihar ke siwan jile ke hulesra gaanv main hua
 Badri Narayan's father's name was Pandit Ras Bihari Pandey, who was a Mukhtar in the Chhapra court by profession

 After this, on 26 June, the BJP will hold a press conference against the Congress all over the country, the BJP ministers will be responsible for the attack on the Congress in the press conference
 jabaki 26 june ko amit shah gujarat main press conference karenge
 The BJP is preparing to take the field against Emergency this time with full strategy, since the Emergency was imposed in the country after the signing of President Fakhruddin since May 25, 1975

 a nine-year-old prince of Jaipur is preparing to take up the post of 'maharaja' of Sirmour, a former princely state located in the hills of southern Himachal Pradesh
 13 april ko nanhen lakshya raaj kaa gotra maanav se badalakar atri kar diya gaya
 The tribe of the royal family of Sirmaur is Atri
 sirmaur ke nae 'raja' ke rup main apni bhavi bhoomika se beparwaah lakshya jaipur ke city pales main ghantebhar se chal rahe mantrocchar or dhoop-deep kii suhaani khushboo ke bich besabri se anushthan ke puure hone kaa intjaar kar rahaa tha
 All this was happening under the special supervision of the royal representatives of Sirmour, Arak Singh, Ajay Bahadur Singh and Abhay Bahadur Singh
 lakshya kii maa 43 varshiya diya kumari or daadi 75 varshiya padmini devi kii snehil nigahon se aashirwad baras rahaa tha
 a royal coronation is scheduled to take place on May 15 at Nahan's royal palace, which is expected to be attended by dozens of former princely houses
 lekin sirmaur ke baahar byaahi betiyon ke bacchon main se vaaris kaa chunaav shahi mahal kii shant dikh rahi phijaaon main khalabali jarur paidaa karegaa
 Lakshya Raj is the younger son of the last Maharaja of Jaipur Marhoom Brigadier Bhavani Singh and the only Aulad Diya Kumari of Padmini Devi
 1997 main diya ne jab apane pita ke gotra ke ek aam aadmi narendra singh se shaadi kar lee to rajput samudaay ke liye use pachaana aasaan na tha
 Bhavani Singh pushed Diya's elder son 14-year-old Padmanabha into law in 2002, pushing him beyond his patriarchal ego rather than exiting his life because his veins had the blood of the gotra of the Jaipur royal family, which gave him his blood
 Was inherited from father
 2011 main apane dada ke nidhan par is kishor ne jaipur ke maharaja kaa taj pahana
 Lakshya Raj's journey to the throne of Sirmaur is also full of complications
 taj tak ve asal main apni nani padmini devi ke jariye pahunch rahe hai
 Padmini is the daughter of Rajendra Prakash, the last Maharaja to rule Sirmaur
 maharaja kii 1964 main maut ho gai or koi paatr uttaradhikari bhi taiyaar na ho sakaa
 In such a situation, questions are being raised about the coronation of the target
 padmini ke 58 varshiya sautele bhattije udai prakaash ne daawa kiya he ki 'gaddi par pehla adhikaar meraa he
 He argues that his grandmother Durga Devi and the first wife of the two wives of the late Maharaja had legally adopted him in 1965
 bharat sarkaar ne bhi ise manyata de di thi lekin yah vaaris privi purse par koi daawa nahin kar saktaa tha
 Arak, Ajay Bahadur and Abhay Bahadur, who hold important status in the royal family of Sirmaur, strongly oppose Uday Prakash's claim to the crown
 purv vidhayak ajay bahadur singh kehete hai, ''unhen shahi pratinidhiyon main koi sweekaar nahin kar saktaa or ve shaayad hi kabhi naahan aate hai
 "it is a meaningless quarrel over the title that has been carried on from a distant past
" lakshya raaj ko mil rahi 'gaddi' se unhen sirmaur kii mukhya shahi sampatti par koi khaas kanoonee adhikaar nahin milane vaala, sivaa unki daadi se milane vaali viraasat ke
 The property of the Sirmaur royal family includes the royal palace and a huge villa in Nahan, several acres of agricultural land and a tea estate in Dehradun
 iske bantwaare ke sambandh main padmini devi or udai prakaash ne 2011 main ek kanoonee samjhaute par dastakhat kiye the
 Though the title is purely a symbol, it still shows its importance among the former royal families of India as it gives a high standing to their personality in the society and gives them the right to lead in traditional occasions and celebrations
 diya kumari kii aawaaj main bhavani singh ke liye thodi shikaayat jhalkati he kyonki unhone unhen rani kii padavi nahin di thi
 She says, "my father loved me very much but he chose a male heir to follow the tradition
" '' vaise ve khush hai ki unke donon beton padmanabh or lakshya raaj ko 'maharaja' banaaya gaya he or is tarah unhen bhi 'ranima' yaa 'rajmata' kaa darja hasil ho chukaa he

 Devotion of wild bears is made in Mahasamund district of Chhattisgarh on seeing God
 jile ke bagbahara tehsil mukhyalay se mahaj paanch kilometre kii duuri par jangal ke bichon-bich maa chandi devi kaa bhavy mandir sthit he
 Along with the devotees, the entire family of bears also visit this Devi temple for darshan
 chandi devi mandir main pratidin saikadon bhakt apni manokamana lekar pahunchate hai
 When the bears reach the court of mother, when they see the four devotees of the family, everyone's breath stops
 pradesh ke kai devi mandir gramin kshetron se dur ghaney jangalon or pahadiyon main sthit hai
 Crowds of devotees throng these temples daily
 chandi devi ke mandir main sanjh dhalate hi pichley saal bhar se 'vishesh bhakton' kaa aana-janaa laga hua he
 These devotees, who have unwavering faith and devotion in the Goddess, are none other than the bears of the forest
 bhaaluu kaa puraa kunba saal bhar se har shaam mata ke darshan ke liye pahunch jaataa he
 Ghanshyam Sahu of Bagbahara, a regular visitor to the temple, told VNS that the entire family of bears is desperate to see Chandi Maa in the temple
 bhaaluon ke is kunbe main chaar sadsy hai
 She has two naughty children along with male and female bears in this unique goddess devout bear family
 bundeli nivasee rohit verma bataate hai ki pichley ek saal se yah silsilaa jari he
 Verma said that the bear family comes here every day
 parivaar kaa ek sadsy mandir ke baahar sidhiyon ke paas khadaa rahata he or maadaa bhaaluu apane do bacchon ke saath mandir main daakhil ho jaati he
 All three bears are absorbed in devotion to the Goddess
 devi maa chandi kii 23 feet oonchi murti kii ye teenon parikrama karte hai or uske baad vahaan anya bhakton dwaara chadaaye gaye prasad ko bade chaav se khate hai
 After doing so, this family of bears quietly goes back to the jungles
 pichley saal bhar se bhaaluon kii bhakthi kaa yah daur jari he
 The priest of the temple says that neither these bears have ever been violent during this time, nor has any other devotee been harmed till date
 alabatta, agar unki bhakthi ke bich koi unhen pareshaan kare, bhagane kaa prayaas kare yaa prasad khaane se roke, tab ye jarur gusse kaa izhaar karte dikhte hai
 While villagers consider this devotion of bears to be the grace of mother, wildlife experts consider the lack of food for bears in the forests as the main reason behind this
 vajah chaahe jo bhi ho, bagbahara kaa yah devi mandir in bhaaluon ke chalate prasiddh hota ja rahaa he
 It includes some out-of-date books like Kalidas's 'kumarasambhavaam' and Nehru's 'an Autobiography' and the most loved love story of Vikram Set's 'golden Gate', Abithav Ghosh's 'sea of papis' and Jhumpa Lahiri's 'uncustomed Earth' etc

 Joshi was the chief guest of the cultural program held at Kanhaiyalal Smriti Bhawan in Varanasi
 is dauraan joshi na sirf yahaan ke saanskrithik rang main range, balki unhone holi geet ke saath hanuman chalisa sun sukun ke pal bitaye
 However, even after this, his mind kept diving into the world of politics

 Where i live, the wind that is blowing there today comes to you or not, but Baba definitely reaches Bholenath

 Sometimes i think i am very lucky who was born in Prayag (allahabad) and got a chance to live in Kashi (varanasi)
 magar kabhi ye bhi sochataa hum ki koun sa paap kiya hum ki sansad main baithta hum

 mumbai indiens kaa abhiyaan is toornament main niraashajanak tareeke se samaapt hua, kyonki use pichley chaar maichon main aaj teesri haar jhelni padi, jabaki ek match barish kii bhent chadh gaya tha
 The victory for the Sydney Sixers, who had already qualified for the semi-finals with the Lions from Group (B), would boost the morale of the players for the next round of the tournament as the team defended such a meager goal
 mumbai indiens kii anushaasit gendbaaji se sidney sixrs kii team bhale hi saat wicket par 136 ran kaa score hi khadaa pai ho, lekin uske gendbaajon ne behtareen pradarshan kiya
 Chasing this target, Mumbai Indians started well, but losing wickets at frequent intervals could only manage 124 runs for eight wickets in 20 overs

 This led to the Big Bash champion team taking hold of the match

 Henriques took the opening two wickets

 On the other hand, Mulayam Singh Yadav, contesting from Mainpuri, 2 from his son Akhilesh Yadav
 13 karod rupee kaa lone liya he
 Mulayam Singh Yadav has also revealed in his affidavit that he has given wife Sadhana Yadav 6 to other members of his family

 7 lakh rupees and 9 to another member Mridula Yadav
 8 lakh rupee kaa lone diya he

 pehali vajah to yah he ki yah lone ve aasaani se le sakate hai or iske liye unhen koi byaaj nahin dena padataa
 In large loans, the amount of interest is very high, so if you get an interest-free loan, then they get a lot of relief
 duusari taraf, lone dene vaale sadsy ko inakam tex main bachat hoti he
 Suppose a leader has invested one crore rupees in FD or any other means, then he has to pay tax on the income he earns through interest or other means

 ' After the Congress in Karnataka assembly elections, BJP also released the second list of its 82 candidates late in the evening on Monday
 in list ke jari hone ke baad donon partiyon par sawaal uth rahe hai
 There are many names in the BJP list that are questioning the claims of the campaign against the corruption of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP President Amit Shah
 vahiin congress bhi apni list main shaamil ek-do naamon ko lekar vipaksh ke nishane par he
 Explain that out of the total 224 seats in Karnataka, BJP has so far announced the names of 154 candidates
 jabaki congress 218 ummidavaaron kii list jari kar chuki he
 There is a ruckus in both the parties as soon as the ticket is announced saath hi sawaal bhi khadey hone lage hai
 While the question of giving tickets to the Reddy brothers is coming up in the BJP, giving tickets to HS Chandramouli, who was the advocate of Mehul Choksi for the Congress, has become a sore throat
 bellari se reddy ko tikatbijepi ne 82 ummidavaaron kii duusari list somvaar ko jari kii
 In this, g Somashekhar Reddy, elder brother of Minister g Janardhana Reddy, who was accused of mining scam in the previous state government of BJP, has been given ticket from Bellary City

 Let me tell you that the entire party including Congress President Rahul Gandhi was besieging the Modi government regarding Mehul Choksi
 congress ne bijepi par palatwaar karte hue kaha ki lalit modi ke vakil sushamaa ke pati or unki beti rahi hai
 BJP should answer this
 congress ne lalit modi ke maamle main vasundhara or sushamaa swaraj istipha den
 The Congress fought the Arun Jaitley case on behalf of the Bhopal Gas Tragedy Company
 kya wo istipha denge? congress ne saaf kar diya he ki chandramauli kaa tikat hold par nahin daalaa gaya he
 It is worth noting that despite the defeat of Chandramouli MLC elections, the Congress has given the assembly ticket
 iske alaava congress main tikat vitaran ke baad se hi bavaal machaa hua he
 In this regard, the office of the party has been vandalized on Monday
 congress ke kai netaa tikat ko lekar sawaal khadey kar rahe hai or siddharmaiya ko iske liye jimmedaar banaaya ja rahaa he

 ab se kareeb 22 maheene pehle mumbai ke ek apartment main ek iees afasar kii beti or ubhartee hui vakil pallavi purkysth kaa katl kar diya gaya tha
 Later it is learned that the murderer killed Pallavi because he had failed to force her
 mumbai kii seshan court ne teji se maamle kii sunwaayee karte hue somvaar ko is mukademe kaa faisla suna diya
 The court has convicted Pallavi's murder for Sajjad Mughal alias Sajjad Pathan, the security guard of the same apartment
 lekin use faansee hogi yaa umr kaid, iskaa elaan 3 july ko hoga
 Pallavi's parents and Sumita have demanded the death penalty for security guard Sajjad Mughal
 25 saal kii pallavi mumbai main farhaan akhtar kii company acksal antertenment privet limited main kaam karti thi or pichley do saal se mumbai main hi apane bwoyfriend avik sengupta ke saath posh ilaake wadala sthit himalayan hits building main rahati thi
 What is the whole matter? The incident took place on 9 August 2012
 wochaman sajaad aksar pallavi kaa peechha karata tha
 Pallavi had even scolded her several times
 isi kaa badla lene ke liye usne katl ko anjaam diya
 On the night of the murder, Sajjad cut off the light of Pallavi's flat
 bijli thik karne ke bahaane wo electrician ke saath pallavi ke flats main daakhil hua or chupake se flats kii chaabi chura lee
 After some time, by opening the door with the same key, he entered Pallavi's room
 pehle usne rape kii koshish kii or phir pallavi ke pratirodh karne par chaaku godakar uski hatya kar di
 Shakapallavi was dead on the boyfriend and in the initial investigation, the suspicion of the police went to Pallavi's boyfriend
 phir shuruuaati bayaan or saboot bhi usee kii taraf ishaara kar rahe the
 But after interrogating the boyfriend, the police felt that the matter was something else
 police ne jab baariki se sari kadiyaan jodani shuru kin to pataa chalaa ki katl ke baad se hi kaatil uski najaron ke saamne tha
 Just late to recognize
 mumbai police ne pallavi kii murder mistry behad kam vakt main hi sulajhaa lee thi
 In order to convict him of this unsolved murder in the Guptimagar court, it was necessary that all the witnesses and evidence should be presented in concrete manner
 mumbai police ne yahi kiya
 In this regard, the evidence which was most effective against Sajjad Mughal was the frequent power to Pallavi's house on the night of the incident
 puri sosayadi main bijli yaa phone kii koi dikkat nahin thi
 Just in Pallavi's flat, the phone was disconnected and electricity was also cut
 or ye sajeesh thi usee sajaad kii
 However, one regrettable aspect of this whole story is that almost a year after Pallavi's death, her boyfriend Avik Sengupta was also killed
 avik ne vaardaat ke baad sabase pehle pallavi kii laash dekhi thi
 The cause of Avik's death was illness
 ab adaalat ne sajaad ko pallavi kii maut kaa gunahagaar to qaraar de diya he par use kya sajaa milegi, iskaa elaan 3 july ko hoga
 However, according to the sections under which Sajjad has been convicted, he can be punished from life imprisonment to death
 haalanki pallavi ke ghar waalon kii maang he ki unki beti ke kaatil ko maut se kam sajaa nahin milani chahie

 hooda kaa kahana he ki haryana main bijepi or congress kii sidhi takkar he
 The JJP and other parties are acting like the bjp's b team
 hooda kaa kahana he ki haryana main congress ke paksh main maahaul he or congress bahumat kii sarkaar banaaegi, kyonki bijepi sarkaar ne pichley 5 saal main koi vikaas kaam nahin kiya
 Bhupendra Singh Hooda says, 'in the name of development, the Khattar government did not erect a single brick, neither laid a new metro line, nor brought any railway line, nor did roads be built while our government made Haryana in the name of development Number one was done while the Khattar government made number one in the name of crime
 berogari ke naam par number van haryana pradesh bana diya he
 Hooda says that today the youth are wandering unemployed
 'chunaav main mudda haryana sarkaar kii naakaami: hoodachunaav main mukhya mudde ke bare main bhupendra singh hooda kaa kahana he, 'haryana vidhansabha chunaavamein mukhya mudda haryana sarkaar kii naakaami he, logon ko rojgaar chahie, shiksha chahie, swasthya chahie lekin sab main manohar laal khatter sarkaar vifal sabit hui he
 This is the biggest issue for us in elections
 'dhara 370 ke sawaal par bhupendra singh hooda kaa kahana he, 'dhara 370 kaa maine pehle hi samarthan kiya he, lekin is chunaav main dhara 370 koi mudda nahin he
 The issue is about livelihood, employment, development, this issue of BJP is not affecting anywhere
 '90 main se 110 siten bhi khud ko de sakati he bijepi: hoodashok tanvar ne dushyant chautaala kaa samarthan kiya, is par bhupendra singh hooda kaa kahana he, 'yah log subah kisi kaa samarthan karte hai, shaam ko kisi ke paale main ja baithte hai
 Their departure will not make any difference
 bijepi ke 75 paar ke naare par bhupendra singh hooda kaa kahana he ki bijepi kuch bhi naaraa de, usase kya fark padataa he
 If their bus runs, then out of 90 seats, 110 seats can also be given on their own, but the BJP has nothing on the ground
 pradesh kii janata ko tay karnaa he ki kisko kitni siten milengi
 Police of four states of the country were looking for him

 arshad khan pehle mevaat ke kukhyat badmaash salli khan ke liye kaam karata tha, lekin baad main arshad ne apana gang bana liya tha
 Delhi Police arrested 17 gang miscreants, including Salli Khan, in 2011 and 2012
 tab pataa laga tha ki ye badmaash kitne khatarnaak hai
 According to the police, before committing any crime, they used to rob a big car, then commit the crime with that robbed car

 input language ganatantr diwas ke maukey par rajpath par hone vaali parade main is baar desh kaa pehla swadeshi ladaaku vimaan tejas bhi hissaa legaa
 Three Tejas planes will fly from Bikaner and pass over Rajpath during the parade
 tejas ko pichley saal hi bhartiya vayusena main shaamil kiya gaya tha
 Since an accident in 1989, usually single-engine aircraft have been avoided for safety
 oktober 1989 main miraj 2000 fiter plane palam airforce stesan par bhartiya vayusena kii 57veen varshganth ke maukey par yojit samaaroh ke dauraan durghatnagrast ho gaya tha
 In fact, there is a danger of hitting birds with an engine jet flying relatively low
 isliye jab vishaal jansamooh maujuud ho yaa mahatvapurn hastiyaan upasthit hon tab in vimaanon ko udaane se bachaa jaataa he, haalanki visheshgyon ke mutabik ye koi niyam nahin he
 According to The Hindu, a Yer Marshall (retd) m Matheswaram said that the mig-21 and Mirage 2000 had flown on the Rajpath, though he also admitted that this was not very common
 tejas ko hindustan aironautics limited yani echeel ne banaaya he
 By 2018, 18 aircraft, the first squadron will be ready for the Air Force
 iske baad hi tejas ko kisi forward aria main tainaat kiya jayega

 Tejas can fly at an altitude of 50 thousand feet
 1350 kilometre prati ghante kii raftaar se tejas ek udaan main 2,300 kilometre kii duuri tay kar saktaa he, jabaki jeef-17 2,037 kilometre kii duuri
 While Tejas can fly with 3000 kg explosives and bombs, JF-17 can carry only 2,300 kg
 tejas hawa main hi tel bharva saktaa he par jeef-17 aisa nahin kar saktaa
 The most important thing is that Tejas can fly in the air only after running 460 meters, while Chinese aircraft have to travel 600 meters to do so

 The new Janata Parivar is formed to compete with the BJP
 mulaayam, lalu, nitish, chautaala, devgauda sabhi ek hue hai or inaki aguwai karenge mulaayam singh yadav
 If seen, it is a party of the backward people, but the challenge of this family is to be together
 ye ikattha hi hote hai bikharane ke liye
 Now let us see what will be the effect in Bihar
 lalu or nitish kaa milanaa kaagaj par to majboot dikhataa he yadi vot ke lihaaj se dekhen to magar vah hakeekat nahin he
 Lalu's constant incitement to Jeetan Ram Manjhi is not hidden from anyone
 maanjhi ke saath argedy ke saansad pappu yadav bhi hai
 Manjhi is meeting BJP leaders but the matter is not being worked out
 maanjhi ke vivaadit bayanon kii vajah se bijepi unhen choona nahin chaahati, iske bajaae bijepi chaahati he ki maanjhi nai party banaaen jisamen pappu yadav bhi hon or unki party ko bijepi peeche se madad kare taaki maanjhi puure bihar main prachaar karen or mahadalit vot bank main send lage
 On the other hand, Lalu Yadav is worried about what this new Janata family has for his family
 khud to chunaav nahin lard sakate magar rabari, misa or donon beton ke bhavishya kaa sawaal he
 How will the seats be aligned
 abhi jediu ke paas 115 seat he or argedy ke paas keval 22
 In such a situation, there is bound to be differences in seat sharing
 abhi tak jediu 141 or bijepi 102 siten ladatin thi
 Congress will also ask for its share
 jediu main bhi asantusht netaaon kaa ek gut he jo chunaav ke vakt bijepi main jane kii taak main he
 The BJP too does not have strong candidates in 141 seats as it has never contested these seats
 ye siten jediu ladati thi
 Nitish is compelled that the political stance he played by making Manjhi the Chief Minister backfired
 maanjhi ne jo nuksaan kiya he nitish kii chhavi kaa, uski bharpai karne main vakt lag rahaa he or isse nitish kumaar ke aatmavishvaas par bhi asar padaa hoga
 Also, bjp's compulsion to win 22 seats in Lok Sabha elections is also their compulsion
 yahi vajah he ki lalu se haath mila kar nitish kumaar apana kila majboot kar lenaa chaahate hai
 Bihar has a strong vote bank of 15 per cent Yadav, 17 per cent Muslim and 7 per cent Kurmi
 isamen 23 fisadi ati pichhadaa ek aisa gathjod ho saktaa he jisamen send lagaana mushkil hoga
 This is the reason why BJP is eyeing 16 per cent Dalit votes
 kul mila kar bihar main sabaki apni-apni majaburi he jisaki vajah se ve saath aae hai
 In politics, no one is a permanent friend or enemy
 vaise ek baar nitish kumaar ne kaha tha ki lalu ji kii party or hamaari party ke log ek duusare dal main jate hai to turant set ho jate hai kyonki jepi andolan se abhi tak ham sab ne kabhi na kabhi saath jarur kaam kiya he
 Hopefully, this formula will work this time and this new Janata family will last for a few days at least till Bihar elections

 Within ten years, the competition of the telecom industry delivering mobiles in crores of hands (two companies survived) is on death bed
 bachi hui sarkari companiyon ke munh main ganga jal daalaa ja rahaa he, network laailaaj hai or mobile seva mahangi ho rahi he
 The country's brightest revolution is rubbing heels
 bharat jaise kisi desh main aisa kam hi hua hoga jab ek dashak ke bheetar sarkaron ke nitigat andhatv ne desh kii sabase badi safalataa ko nestnabud kar diya
 First the freshest example
 
 
 agar doorsanchaar companiyon ko raahat hi di jaani thi to phir doorsanchaar vibhaag 2005 se nai license fees kii nai paribhaasha lagu karne kaa mukadmaa kyon lard rahaa tha jiske tahat desh kii pramukh nijee telecom (khaastaur par air tail va vodaphone-idia) companiyon par kareeb ek lakh karod ru
 The liability has come out
 ab is boj se dub rahi companiyon ko bachaane ke liye aalaa afasaron kii ek cameti bitha di gai he, jo nayaa raahat package lekar aegi
 In March 2015, the Modi government conducted the so-called most successful spectrum auction in the history of India
 camaron ke saamne date mantri daawey kar rahe the ki is nilaamee se 1
 10 lakh crore Rs
 milenge; or sarkaar ne 2ji ghotaale ke kathith nuksaan kii bharpai kar lee he
 But by March 2018, 7 telecom companies buying spectrum at a higher price
 7 lakh karod ru
 Was buried in debt
 companiyon kii chitkaar (lamabandi) se pighalate hue sarkaar ne tay kiya ki ab ve das saal kii jagah 16 saal main spectrum kii fees dengi
 That is, the great 'achievement' of March 2015 was Rs 550 billion on companies within three years
 kii meharbaani main badal gai
 You can again ask if there was a need to sell such expensive spectrum if forgiveness was to be given
 sarkaar ko kuch mila nahin, companiyon kaa kuch gaya nahin, bas bank (aam logon kii bachat) cat gaye, jo spectrum ke badale companiyon karj de baithe the
 The insistence on not learning from mistakes has become a permanent feature of government policies related to this industry
 1999 main duuranchaar companiyon ko baari license fees kii jakad se aaazaad karne se lekar aaj tak sarkaar yah tay nahin kar pai he ki vah companiyon ko phalne-phoolne dena chaahati he yaa unako nichod lenaa chaahati he
 After the Supreme Court's decision, once again, one hand of the government wants to squeeze the companies while the other is trying to create a salvation package for it
 telecom kshetra kaa galaa ghont dene vaali nitigat dhundh kii shuruyaat us 2ji ghotaale se hui jo adaalat main kabhi sabit nahin hua
 All the accused were acquitted
 jaanch agenciyon ne hycourt ke faisle ke khilaaf oonchi adaalat main jane kii jahamat nahin uthaai lekin aropiyon par faisla aane se paanch saal main 122 companiyon ke license radd ho gaye
 Billions of investments were sunk, thousands of jobs lost and the face of the telecommunications market changed
 udyog main pratispardhaa khatm ho gai
 Cartels and monopolies began to emerge
 nijee companiyon kii lamabandi main uljhi sarkaar apane upakramon (beasenel-emtnael) ko pratispardhaatmak bananaa tak bhul gai
 Today, both government companies are on the verge of becoming history
 pehle moti license fees yaa mahangaa spectrum or phir bel out 
 
 
 This has happened so many times in India's telecom sector that the entire industry has been destroyed by being trapped in the vortex
 kahana mushkil he ghotaalaa 2ji aavanton main hua yaa uske baad, lekin aaj ham yahaan khadey hai:• puraa bazaar do companiyon ke haath main simat rahaa he
 In that also one (airtel) is in bad condition and the other (vodafone-idea) is gone now
 • bainkon ke nae enpie telecom kshetra main ug rahe hai• mobile network bad se badtar ho gaye• 5ji kaa kriyanvayan mushkil he
 There is a danger of monopoly in it
 kyonki spectrum kiraaya dene kii kshamta keval reliance jio main he• ab baari mahangi telecom seva kii hatelecom kranti kii yah durdasha prakritik sansadhano ko bazaar main baantne kii niti main asamanjas ke kaaran hui he
 The government auctioned spectrum (or fees) at a higher price to show revenue rising and handed over the market of crores of consumers to two-three companies with political clout
 in companiyon ne bainkon se karj (jamakartaon kaa paisa) uthaakar sarkaar ke khate main rakh diya or phir baad main fees bhugtan main mohalat bhi le lee
 This is going to happen after the latest decision of the Supreme Court
 jarurat darasal yah thi ki sansadhano kaa sahi moolyankan kiya jaae
 They should be kept cheap so that their use increases investment, demand, jobs and competition and keeps the rates low for the consumer
 ab ham telecom kranti ke shokat ke kareeb hai, jahaan 2015 ke baad se kareeb ek lakh se zyada naukariyaan ja chuki hai
