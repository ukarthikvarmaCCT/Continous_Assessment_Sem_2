 At the same time, a lawyer Akhilesh Chaubey filed a petition in the Supreme Court to protest against this whole development and said that the court is talking of hearing other people's cases later, but in Salman's case, haste is being done
 tippaniyan The petition said that Salman was granted interim bail without a copy of the Sessions court order, but there is no clear rule
 yadi aisa he to supreme court ko koi niyam bananaa chahie
 The Supreme Court said that the case will be heard tomorrow or Monday
 yachika main kaha gaya he ki salmaan ko bina seshans court ke aadesh kii prati ke antarim jamaanat de di gai, lekin aisa koi saaf niyam nahin he
 If so, the Supreme Court should make a rule
 vahiin supreme court ne kaha ki maamle kii sunwaayee kal yaa somvaar ko karenge

 Prior to the Lok Sabha elections in the country, Congress President Rahul Gandhi's sister Priyanka Gandhi is not taking the name of stopping personal attacks on her for her entry in politics
 apane vivaadaaspad bayanon ko lekar aksar charchaa main rahane vaale uttar pradesh se bijepi vidhayak surendra singh ne rahul gandhi kii tulana ravan se kii to vahiin priyanka gandhi ko shurpanakha bataa diya
 In fact, Congress has given charge of eastern Uttar Pradesh, making Priyanka Gandhi the party general secretary
 isi sambandh main upi ke baliya jile ke bairiya se vidhayak se jab sawaal poocha gaya to unhone kaha ki jab ram or ravan main yuddh hone vaala tha, tab ravan ne apni bahan ko bheja tha
 Now there is Modi in the role of Rama and Rahul as Ravana has fielded his sister Priyanka as his heroine, so Mann's victory is Lanka
 iske alaava surendra singh ne kaha ki congress tuuti hui naav he
 Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan won elections due to SC / ST Act
 lekin ab use koi chandan nahin lagane vaala
 Let me tell you that since Priyanka Gandhi's entry into active politics, attacks by BJP leaders have intensified
 isse pehle bihar sarkaar main mantri or bijepi netaa vinod narayan jha ne kaha tha ki priyanka gandhi abhi nausikhia hai
 Congress should understand that beautiful face does not get votes
 iske baad bihar ke up-mukhyamantri susheel kumaar modi ne priyanka ko daagi jeevanasathi vaali mahila kaha tha
 The same bjp's Rajya Sabha MP Subramanian Swamy had said in a statement that there is a problem with Priyanka, which is not suitable in public life
 wo logon ko peethti hai
 Nobody knows when Priyanka will lose balance, people of the country should know this
 swami ke alaava bijepi ke varisht netaa or mahasachiv kailash vijayawargeey ne apane bayaan main kaha tha ki unke (congress) paas netaa nahin hai, isliye wo chocolati chehre ke madhyam se chunaav main janaa chaahate hai
 
 
 
 
 Some play Kareena Kapoor's name, some bring Salman Khan's name, sometimes they bring Priyanka Gandhi
 haalanki baad main is maamle main safai dete hue vijayawargeey ne kaha tha ki unhone 'chocolati' shabd kaa prayog bollywood ke sitaron ke liye kiya tha
 After making Priyanka Gandhi the former general secretary in-charge of Uttar Pradesh, big leaders of BJP have made controversial comments on her
 ek media report ke mutabik upi main yogi adityanath sarkaar main mantri upendra tiwari ne kaha tha ki loksabhaa chunaav aate-aate priyanka gandhi ke ladke bhi raajnneeti main aa jaaenge, kyonki rahul gandhi ke paas to hai nahin

 Amitabh wrote in a tweet that seeing the girl whose name is written as 'gudiya' by the media, she came across a poem written by her father Harivansh Rai Bachchan

 a story of the Prime Minister of the country Narendra Modi and his ever-ally Shankar Singh Vaghela is in the news these days
 yah story angreji akhbaar 'da hindu' main chhapi he jise soshal media par khub share kiya ja rahaa he
 The story recounts a 'train journey' of Modi and Vaghela almost 24 years ago, in which these two leaders, in their humble nature, left a deep impression on two strangers
 indian railway (trephic) sarvice main senior afasar leena sharma ne 90 ke dashak main apni ahmedabad yatra kaa zikr kiya he jisamen unki mulaakaat modi or waghela se hui thi
 However, Modi and Vaghela did mention their names in the introduction during the journey, but Leena did not remember their names
 haa, yah safar itnaa yaadgaar rahaa ki in do netaaon ko nahin bhul saki hai
 It was at that time that Leena Sharma, a resident of Assam, was going to Ahmedabad from Delhi with her batchmate
 leena us vakt railway sarvice main probationar thim
 Lena and her batchmate's ticket could not be confirmed
 wo first class bogi ke titii se milin jisapar usne madad karne kaa bharosa diya
 In a while, the TTE led them to a coupé where two leaders wearing white Khadi kurta-pajamas were sitting
 in do sahyatriyon ne leena or unki dost ko baithne kii jagah di
 When the conversation started, politics was discussed
 shyama prasad mukherjee kaa zikr hua
 Even these two leaders invited these two women traveling with them to join the Gujarat BJP, saying that they value the talent
 dinar ke samay chaar veg thali ai
 Everyone had food and Modi paid the bill for everyone
 jab sone kii baari ai to ye donon netaa apni seat se uth gaye or donon mahila afasaron ko apni seat de di or khud farsh par chadar bichhaakar let gaye
 When the train reached Ahmedabad in the morning, these two leaders also offered women officers to stay in case of problems
 yah kahani likhte hue leena sharma ne ek raat pehle kii ghatana kaa zikr kiya he, jab wo lakhanu se dilli aa rahi thim
 In that train too, there were many leaders in his compartment, but his conduct was absolutely unsightly
 lekhika ne is ghatana kaa zikr 1995 main pehali baar assam ke ek akhbaar ke liye likhe apane lekh kiya tha
 At that time, Leena had taken this article in the name of two unknown politicians from Gujarat
 us vakt lekhika ko is baat kaa jaraa bhi ilm nahin tha ki wo jin do rajanetaaon kaa zikr apane lekh main kar rahi hai, wo aane vaale dinon main mashhoor ho jaaenge
 In 1996, when Vaghela became the CM of Gujarat, Lina Sharma was very happy
 When Modi became the CM in 2001, there was no place for the writer's happiness
 aaj modi piem hai
 Whenever Leena Sharma sees Modi on TV, she remembers the 'train journey' of 24 years ago
 gujarat main ab hukka baar chalaane par adhiktam teen saal kii jail kii sajaa mil sakati he

 The engineer told reporters, "dhoni has done a fantastic job so far
 unhone bhartiya team ko ab tak shandaar yogadan diya he or hamen kai championships dilaae
 But we should not be in such a hurry to send them home
 'unhone kaha, 'vah pehle hi test cricket ko alavida kah chuke hai

 INPUT-IANS haryana ke iees adhikari ashok khemka ke saath aap hai yaa nahin magar haryana ke swasthya mantri anil vij unke saath hai
 He has said that he will talk to Chief Minister Khattar
 mukhyamantri ne kaha he ki ve eemaandaar afasar hai magar tabadale kaa adhikaar sarkaar kaa he
 The matter is so simple that the matter would get dimpled
 afasaron ke tabadale sandehon se pare hote to cat se lekar supreme court tak ke aadesh se lekar tamaam tarah ke nirdesh na hote
 If transferred 46 times in 24 years, it may be that after losing defeat, you may start saying that Khemka itself would be doing Khwamkhah
 lekin pange karne kii aadat na hoti to inaki jaanch par bijepi mudda na banaati, sansad main bahes karti or aap robert wadra jaise taqatvar vyakti ke bare main ye sab nahin jaan pate
 Now even the Haryana CAG has found the investigation of Khemka to be correct, which shows that Khemka Khwamkhah does not do pangay
 soch samaj kar haath daalate hai
 The officer who wants to put his hands on such a powerful person, who would want to keep it with him
 wadra kii jaanch ko sieji ne sahi bataa diya magar hooda sarkaar ne un par jo aarope patr daayar kiye the wo abhi tak kaayam he
 Even then Khattar Saheb says that he is honest and Vij Saheb says that i am with him
 desh bhar ke transport vibhaag main kya hota he ise samajhnaa rocket science nahin he
 Pocket Science
 agast 2014 main kendriya mantri nitin gadakari ne kaha tha ki artio main paisa bahut chalata he isliye jaldi hi ise samaapt kar nayaa system laaenge
 But before such a system came in, officers like Khemka were removed
 to kya yah sawaal aapke man main bhi he ki kahin gaadi se zyada paisa chalane vaale vibhaag main sakhti kii sajaa to nahin mili? agar mukhyamantri khatter ke anusaar khemka eemaandaar hai to kya inke jaise afasar kii transport jaise eemaandaar vibhaag main or zarurat nahin he
 Khemka could not remain in the post of Transport Secretary for 128 days
 hooda sarkaar ne unhen archive department bhej diya tha
 Khattar Saheb sent him to the Archaeological Department
 abhilekhaagaar se sangrahalay main
 As soon as the Khattar government came in, Khemka was made Secretary in the Transport Department and Hooda Principal Secretary SS Sandhu was sent to the Department of Archeology
 ab sanghu sahab transport ke atirikt mukhya sachiv ban gaye hai
 In 2013 too, he was transferred overnight from the archive department and sent on electoral duty
 tab bhi ise lekar khub vivaad hua tha
 The government has the right to transfer and there are many reasons
 lekin khemka ke saath jo ho rahaa he kya wo vaaki itnaa saamaanya he? Under the Rule of All India Civil Service Act, the tenure of an officer above the director should be two years
 november 2013 main supreme court ne centre or rajya sarkaron ko nirdesh die the ki ve apane yahaan civil services board kii sthapana kare
 From transfers to postings, promotions and investigations, etc
 adaalat ne yah bhi kaha tha ki civil services board ke sujhaavon ko karypalika khaarij kar sakati he magar isse ek prakriya kaayam ho jaaegi or sabakuch record par hoga
 The court had said to make boards within three months, Hindustan Times reported on March 30, 2015 that only four states have created such boards
 haryana, maharashtra chhattisgarh or mizoram
 The rest of the states have not created
 manamaane tabadalon ko rokane or tay kaarykaal ke liye 77 purv afasaron ne adaalat main janhit yachika daayar kii thi
 It is not publicly known whether the Civil Services Board had any role in the transfer of Khemka or not, but he did not work anywhere except a few times
 karne nahin diya gaya
 The Union Ministry of Personnel also made a rule in January 2014 that the posting of IAS IPS and IFS would be of at least two years
 hridayesh joshi ne aap phir ek report file kii he ki sarkaar badalane se eemaandaar afasaron ke din nahin badalte
 They are better used in opposition
 aisa hi maamla haryana ke hi sanjeev chaturvedi kaa he
 There are 12 transfers in 5 years
 sanjeev chaturvedi ne ames main kai ghotaalon ko ujagar kiya tha lekin harshavardhan ne unhen mukhya satarkta adhikari ke pad se hataa diya
 There were also facts that the current Health Minister Nadda Saheb had written a letter for Chaturvedi's transfer
 sanjeev chaturvedi ne cat yani central administrative tribunal main halafanama daayar kar niyuktiyon ke liye bani centre kii cabinet cameti par hi sawaal uthaa diye hai
 The Prime Minister is the chairman of this committee
 sanjeev chaturvedi ne cat ke saamne 14 aise maamle pesh kiye hai jisamen centre sarkaar ne niyamon main dheel dekar kai afasaron ke tabadale 2 se 4 mihane ke bheetar kiye hai
 Delhi government had asked to send the same Sanjeev Chaturvedi to his place, but has not been sent till date
 vaise indian express kii khabar ke anusaar dilli dialog kamishan ke member sachiv ashish joshi se ek maheene ke bheetar hi charge le liya gaya
 According to sources in the newspaper, Ashish Joshi refused to make Aam Aadmi Party's Voltaire a coordinator
 khabaron ke mutabik ashish khetaan ne phone kar unhen pad chhodane ke liye kah diya
 There will also be a favor of the Delhi government on this, which Sanjay Singh might give in this show
 lekin kul milakar baat yah aati he ki khemka ke tabadale ko kyon na samajha jaae ki ek eemaandaar afasar ko pratadit kiya ja rahaa he

 VHP kaa adhyaksh banane ke baad bharat ghoomane ke pehle ramalala ke darshan karne aayaa hum
 Our movement will start from here only
 bhagwaan ram hamaare sapane ko puraa karenge
 Question- Is VHP adamant on the same stand that whatever the verdict is, the temple will be built there? Answer - There is no reason to disbelieve the court
 hamaara paksh nyaay kaa he or hamen nyaay milegaa
 We will sit together and decide what will happen after the decision of the court
 hamaare yahaan samuhik faisle hote hai
 The chairman alone does not decide
 nyaayalay kaa faisla aane ke baad ham tay karenge ki aage kaise badhanaa he? philhal faisle kaa intjaar kar rahe hai
 So far the wait was endless, but not now

 Contestant Rajrani Bhalla sat on the hot seat in Wednesday's episode of the Amitabh Bachchan-hosted quiz show Kaun Banega Crorepati
 rajrani bhalla ke saath khelte hue amitabh ne khub masti or hansi majaak kiya
 Rajrani Bhalla, using her intelligence and lifelines, reached the mark of 3 lakh 20 thousand
 iske baad unke paas sirf ek hi lifline (50-50) shesh thi
 Rajrani now had to decide whether she would answer the next question or quiz
 lekin amitabh bachchan ne unhen samajhaayaa ki vah duusare padaav se thik agle sawaal par hai to unhen is sawaal kaa jawaab dena chahie kyonki yadi vah galat jawaab bhi dengi to bhi vah kuch khoengi nahin
 Rajrani Bhalla decided to take a lifeline to answer the question after careful consideration
 haalanki sawaal aate hi unhone ye bataa diya tha ki unhen is sawaal ke bare main kuch bhi nahin maaloom he lekin phir bhi unhone pehle apni lifline 50-50 kaa istemaal kiya or phir andhere main tir chalaate hue ek vikalp ko chun liya
 Luckily the same answer turned out well and Rajrani increased from 3 lakh 20 thousand to become a mistress of 6 lakh 40 thousand rupees
 iske baad aayaa 12 lakh 40 hajaar rupee kaa sawaal
 The question was quite complicated and because Rajarani did not even know the answer to this question, he clearly told Amitabh that this question is for him as if someone had sat in a rocket and asked him what it is
 unhone pehle to sawaalon ke opshans ke bare main kuch andaja lagaaya or phir sidhe-sidhe khel ko quit karne kaa faisla le liya

 16-year-old Arun Baidya (name changed) gave this answer when he was asked about the recent india-bangladesh match at Eden Gardens
 arun uttar 24 pargana jile ke halishahar se taalluk rakhata he
 More than love for cricket, this teenager has loyalty to India
 ye uske jivan kii asaliyat he
 Born in a Hindu family in Bangladesh, Arun studies in Class 9
 beete ek dashak se wo bharat main sharnaarthi kii tarah rah rahaa he
 There are people like Arun whose fate will be decided by the New Citizenship Amendment Bill (CAB)
 ye bill somvaar ko loksabhaa main paas kiya ja chukaa he
 Arun's 36-year-old mother had left her in-laws in Barishal (bangladesh) and moved to India in the hope of a better life

 i was injured but i knew only one thing and that was that if i managed to cross the border, i would be saved

 hamaare jaise kai bangladesh se bhaag aae
 'this is my country, my son's future here' Arun's mother says that if the Indian government gives her the identity of an authentic citizen, then crossing the border will be successful and she will be able to secure the life of honor with her son
 arun kii maa kahati he, 'ye meraa desh he, mere bete kaa yahaan bhavishya he
 Why would i go back ' jab india today arun ke ghar par camere ke saath tha to aasapaas se guzarane vaale bhi utsukata se ghar ke andar dekh rahe the
 It is interesting to know that Arun's mother got her and son's Aadhar card made without any documents
 ek taraf CAB ko lekar buudhvaar ko rajyasabha main garmagarm bahes jari he, vahiin arun kii maa kii aakhon main ummid kii kiran dekhi ja sakati he

 i have filed a police complaint
 'urmila matondkar ne kaha ki jo log raily main 'ghuse' the ve aam log nahin the, balki bhaajapa ke the
 He said that common people will not behave in a 'violent manner' like these people do
 unhone kaha, 'jo hamaari raily main ghuse ve ashleel tareeke se naach rahe the or unhone abhadra bhashaa kaa istemaal kiya
 Perhaps they wanted to scare the women running near us
 ' unhone kaha ki vah is mudde par nirvachan ayog ke paas jane par vichaar kar rahi hai
 The code of conduct is being torn apart, BJP workers are threatening us, threatening us
 
 i have had to file a complaint with the police to protect the honor of my female colleagues and to protect myself

 Senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader LK Advani has put the party leadership in the dock for the defeat of Karnataka
 adwani ne apane blog main likhaa he ki agar bhrashtachar ke iljaamon se ghire yediurppa ke khilaaf samay par karrwai kii gai hoti to karnataka kaa nateeja kuch or hota
 He said that he would have been surprised if the BJP had won in Karnataka
 haar kaa postmortem ke bahaane adwani ne apni party par sawaal uthaa die
 Advani has written in his latest blog
 karnataka kii haar kaa mujhe dukh he lekin aashcharya nahin
 Wondering if BJP would have won in Karnataka
 adwani ke mutabik yediurppa ke khilaaf karrwai main deree karnataka main haar kii badi vajah rahi
 Advani has written that BJP did not pull out Yeddyurappa
 wo khud baahar nikle
 In fact, when it was clear that he was involved in corruption, then if the party acted on him immediately, the result would have been different
 press reports main kaha gaya ki yediurppa ko nikaalane kii vajah se ham haare, lekin soniyaji ne virbhadra singh kii galatiyon kii andekhi kii or congress ko iskaa phayda bhi mila
 The BJP is proud of itself for taking a principled decision in Karnataka
 adwani ke mutabik karnataka kaa nateeja bijepi or congress donon ke liye naseehat he ki janata ko halke main naa len
 However, he raised the question that if there is resentment in Bangalore over corruption, then why does it not appear in Delhi? Till now, BJP had believed that Yeddyurappa had a party split in Karnataka but against Yeddyurappa Advani has put his party in the dock for not taking action on time

 Shooting last episode with @ beingsalmankhancoming back soon:) - KAPIL (@ kapilsharmak9) July 1, 2015 Input: PTI narendra modi mangalvaar ko ladakh jaaenge
 This mission of the Prime Minister has many aspects of Kashmir
 ek taraf paimaana vikaas kaa he, to duusari taraf agenda ellection kaa he
 It is also interesting that this is the second visit to Jammu and Kashmir after becoming PM
 modi jab ladakh pahunchenge to unke saath ilaake ke liye do tohfe bhi honge
 If Modi comes, he will show new dreams of dreams to the unopened hills from a stage in Kargil, which will reiterate the confidence of turning dreams shown in election speeches into reality
 lihaaja modi ke liye logon kaa intjaar bhi besabr he
 Unsurprising also because Modi is carrying two gifts for the Ladakh and Kargil regions
 lihaaja pradhanmantri banane ke baad daure ke hisaab se modi ke liye bhi ladakh ahm hoga
 This thing is also being told more by the party and the government
 kargil-leh ko milegaa yah tohfa-modi kargil main do panbizli pariyojnaon kaa udghaatan karne ja rahe hai-inamen 44 megawatt vaala chutak or 45 megawatt vaale nimu-bazgo project shaamil he
 Apart from this, leh-srinagar will also lay the foundation stone of the transmission line
 -is line ke jariye ladakh kshetra desh ke uttari grid se jud jayega, jisase leh or kargil main bijli kii killat dur hogi
 The transmission line Modi is going to lay the foundation of was announced in 2003 by the then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee
 uske baad se latakate-latakate ye pariyojna 300 karod rupee se 1700 karod rupee kii ho gai
 After the announcement, the entire survey and feasibility study of Leh Srinagar transmission line was completed in the UPA government, but Manmohan Singh did not get the good fortune to lay the foundation
 ladakh ke liye saugat ab narendra modi ke haath he, ye hakeekat he
 One political aspect of this is that the people of Ladakh showed confidence in Modi's wave
 loksabhaa chunaav main ladakh seat se bijepi ummidwar ko jitayaa
 There is a good chance for Modi to thank the people
 ladakh ke logon kii ummiden jaagi he
 This is the first success of Modi's visit
 modi inhen ummiido ko sambodhit karenge
 After all, the biggest stage of Modi's Mission Kashmir is ready from the assembly elections

 lekin siesai kii report phikr badhaane vaali he kyonki ab lutinayan dilli kii sadakon par bhi trephic kaa dabaav bad rahaa he or raftaar kam ho gai he
 The report on Lutyens Delhi CSE at 13 places in Delhi has conducted a research on traffic pressure and speed of vehicles
 is research kii report main chaunkaane vaali baat lutian dilli ko lekar he kyonki yahi wo ilaaka he, jo baaki dilli kii tamaam samasyaon, jinamein bijli pani ke saath trephic bhi shaamil he, unase achoota rahata tha
 The speed of traffic in peak hours is less than normal, but the latest report has revealed that bottlenecks are now being made on Lutyens' Delhi roads and traffic intersections have started coming up
 moulana aaazaad road, akbar road or tilak maarg aisi sadaken hai, jahaan trephic ke dabaab ko aanka gaya
 It was found that in the morning and evening, the traffic speed in peak hours is half of normal, although the condition of Lutyens Delhi roads in non-peak hours is better than elsewhere
 'aaj tak' kii team ne liya jayja'aaj tak' kii team ne moulana aaazaad road or akbar road par halaat kaa jayja liya, to pataa chalaa ki sadaken to chaudee hai, lekin yahaan peak owers main chauraahon par gadiyon kii itani bheed ho jaati he ki trephic rengne lagata he
 Also, due to VIP accommodation, the number of vehicles parked on the roadside is also increasing
 isiilie kai baar trephic main rukaawat aa jaati he

 vijay maalya ke malikana haq vaali airlines company kingfisher airlines ko jab sarkari bank idibiai ne 900 karod rupee kaa lone diya tha tab bhi company baari vittiya samasya se jujh rahi thi
 In March 2009, the company was given a loan

 It was not that the bank was not aware of the losses of Kingfisher Airlines
 idibiai bank ke mili note bataate hai ki ek internal note ne in ghaaton ke bare main zikr kiya tha
 That is, this note was pointing to the company's huge losses before the loan was given
 vahiin, ek doosraa note bhi mila he
 The company has been highly praised in this note
 isamen kingfisher company ke brand vailu kii khub baat kahi gai he
 The brand was pledged as collateral, saying such a note
 is vajah se vijay maalya kii company ko ansikyord lone bhi bazaar se kam byaaj par diya gaya
 In the second note, corporate guarantee was also given by Vijay Mallya's Kingfisher Company
 is company ke airlines kai sau karod ke malikana haq vaale share the
 Surprisingly, the bank officials ignored the first note and preferred the second note and gave a loan of Rs 900 crore to Vijay Mallya's huge loss making Kingfisher Airlines
 ab is maamle kii jaanch main lage jaanchakartaaon kaa kahana he ki vijay maalya is paise kaa kaaphi hissaa gaiyr-kanoonee tareeke se videsh le gaya
 Explain that now the owner of this company Vijay Mallya has left the country in a disputed way to London

 Sources are saying that he has not given much information on the meetings with Vijay Mallya
 unhone yah bhi sawaal uthaaya ki unke adhikariyon ke nirnay par sawaal nahin uthaaya janaa chahie
 Along with this, he also said in his defense that even when he left the bank, no one questioned the loan given to Kingfisher Airlines
 aisa nahin tha ki bank ko kingfisher airlines ke ghate ke bare main jaankaree nahin thi
 The IDBI Bank notes found that an internal note mentioned about these losses
 yani lone die jane se pehle yah note company ke baari ghate kii ore ishaara kar rahaa tha
 At the same time, a second note has also been found
 is note main company ke kaaphi prashansa kii gai he
 There is a lot of talk about the brand value of Kingfisher Company

 ascharyajanak rup se bank ke adhikariyon ne pehle note ko nazarandaaj karte hue duusare note ko zyada tarjeeh di or vijay maalya kii baari ghate main chal rahi kingfisher airlines ko 900 karod rupee kaa lone de diya
 Now investigators involved in the investigation of the case say that Vijay Mallya took a lot of this money abroad illegally

 At the same time, the CBI is investigating that there was no nexus between bank officials in giving loans
 tippaniyan In the absence of Mallya, the CBI has asked IDBI the names of the officials who prepared the two notes
 iske alaava un adhikariyon ke naam bhi sibiai ne puche hai jinhone maalya ko lone ko sweekaar kiya tha
 The CBI has already questioned Yogesh Aggarwal, then the head of IDBI

 He also questioned that the decision of his officers should not be questioned
 iske saath hi unhone apane bachaav main yah bhi kaha ki jab unhone bank choda tab bhi kisi ne kingfisher airlines ko lone die jane par sawaal nahin uthaaya

 Yuvraj Singh, who was the hero of India's 2007 T20 World Cup and 2011 Cricket World Cup victories, has announced his retirement from international cricket on Monday
 simit overon ke cricket main gendbaajon kii neend udaane vaale or chitah kii chapaltaa se maidan par gend ko lapakane vaale bharat hi nahin balki duniya ke behtareen olerounder khilaadiyon main shumaar yuvaraj singh ne kaha ki yah unke liye kaaphi bhaavnaatmak pal he or unka kariyar ek roller-coster kii tarah rahaa he
 Yuvraj said that he had been thinking about retirement for a long time and now his plan is to play in the icc-recognized T20 tournaments
 yuvaraj ne apana antim test saal 2012 main khelaa tha
 He last appeared in limited overs cricket in 2017
 yuvaraj ne saal 2000 main pehla vanade, 2003 main pehla test or 2007 main pehla tii-20 match khelaa tha
 Born in 1981 in Chandigarh, Yuvraj played 40 Tests, 304 odis and 58 T20 matches for India
 test main yuvaraj ne teen shatakon or 11 ardhashtakon kii madad se kul 1900 ran banaae jabaki vanade main unhone 14 shatakon or 52 ardhashtakon kii madad se 8701 ran jutaaye
 Similarly, Yuvraj scored 1177 runs in T20 matches
 isamen aath ardhashatak shaamil hai
 Yuvraj has also taken 9 wickets in Tests, 111 wickets in odis and 28 wickets in T20 matches
 yuvaraj ne 2008 ke baad kul 231 tii-20 match khele hai or 4857 ran banaae hai
 He has also taken 80 wickets in T20 matches
 bharat ne jab saal 2011 main mahendra singh dhoni ke netritv main duusari baar isisi world cap jeeta tha, tab yuvaraj ek ladaake ke rup main saamne aae the
 Yuvraj scored 362 runs (one century and four half-centuries) in that World Cup besides taking 15 wickets and was named Player of the Tournament in addition to Man of the Match four times
 yuvaraj ke liye vah world cap khaas tha kyonki jab bharat ne pehali baar world cap jeeta tha, tab unka janm bhi nahin hua tha or jab vah world champion bane to unhone apane naam ek anokhaa ricard jod liya
 Yuvraj is the first all-rounder to score more than 300 runs in a World Cup, besides taking 15 wickets
 world cap ke baad yuvaraj cancer se peedit bataae gaye or phir america main unka lambe samay tak ilaaj chalaa
 Yuvraj returned to the national team after defeating cancer but after that his life was not the same
 yuvaraj un chuninda khilaadiyon main se ek hai, jinhone bharat ke saath do world cap jite hai
 In 2007, when India won the T20 World Cup, Yuvraj was a member of the team and during that time Yuvraj had to hit six sixes in one over of England bowler Stuart Broad
 us match main yuvaraj ne 12 gendon par ardhashatak puraa kiya tha, jo antarrashtriya cricket main aaj bhi ek mile kaa pathar bana hua he
 In the final of the natwest Trophy held in England in 2002, at the Lord's Stadium, Yuvraj made a memorable victory for India by scoring 69 runs
 yuvaraj ne aise samay main mohammad caff ke saath milakar shatkeey saajhedaari kii thi, jab bharat ne apane top order ke ballebaajon ko saste main kho diya tha
 After winning that match, Indian captain Sourav Ganguly took off his jersey and waved in the air from Lord's balcony
 yah bhartiya cricket ke sabase yaadgaar drishyon main se ek he
 That victory of India in the natwest Trophy changed the mood of Indian cricket and Yuvraj has been a major contributor to it
 cricket main unki shandaar uplabdhiyon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue bharat sarkaar ne saal 2012 main unhen arjuna puraskaar diya or phir do saal baad desh ke chauthe sabase bade naagarik alankaran-padmashri se nawaja
 In 2014, Royal Challengers Bangalore bought the Punjab player for Rs 14 crore in the IPL and after that in 2015, Delhi Daredevils (now Delhi Capitals) added Yuvraj to them for Rs 16 crore
 is tarah yuvaraj ipel itihaas ke sabase mahange khilaadi bane the

 He left his studies in between

 She told the worker that there is no one at home

 But the public did not let such a situation arise

 The public, which supported the previous UPA government from outside and then withdrew support on the nuclear deal, was reduced to 24 seats

 The Janata was able to teach the leaders once again that it is meant only by development

 After winning a massive majority in the Lok Sabha elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party has started preparing for the assembly elections in several states
 bhartiya janata party kii sabase zyada nigaah pashchim bengal par he
 Since winning 18 of the 42 Lok Sabha seats in West Bengal, the Bharatiya Janata Party is in a tizzy and is planning to oust the Mamata Banerjee government from power
 bhartiya janata party ne mamata banerjee ko maat dene ke liye jayshri ram or jai mahakali ke jayakaare ke saath chunaav prachaar karne kii ranneeti banaai he
 Bharatiya Janata Party national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya, who reached West Bengal for the first time after the victory in the Lok Sabha elections, said that during the assembly elections in West Bengal, the slogan of the Bharatiya Janata Party would be Jai Shri Ram and Jai Mahakali
 jab tak pashchim bengal kii satta se mamata banerjee kii netritv vaali trinmul congress ko bedakhal nahin kar diya jayega, tab tak yah abhiyaan jari rahegaa
 He said that Bengal is the land of Mahakali

 bhartiya janata party ne jai mahakali naare ko apni suchi main us samay shaamil kiya he, jab trinmul congress bhartiya janata party ko bahari logon kii party bataa rahi he
 It is also alleging that the people of the Bharatiya Janata Party have no understanding of the culture of Bengal

 On Sunday, Mamata Banerjee claimed in a Facebook post that attempts were being made to spread hatred, which should be opposed
 jai siya ram, jai ram ji kii or ram naam satya he kaa dharmik or saamaajik matlab nikalataa he
 We respect these sentiments, but the BJP is using religious slogans like Jai Shri Ram as its party slogan

 Soren, who had agreed before this arrangement, told reporters in Bokaro that there was no deadline for his resignation
 ‘sarkaar badalane kaa sawaal tabhi aata he, jab koi vikaas na ho rahaa ho
 But development is going on now
 jharkhand main pichley maheene us samay raajnneetik sankat paidaa ho gaya tha, jab sorain ne loksabhaa main vipaksh ke katautee prastaav ke khilaaf matdaan kar diya tha or bhaajapa ne unki sarkaar se samarthan vaapasi kaa elaan kiya tha
 The BJP later softened its stance and placed a condition of giving the chief minister's post to any of its candidates

 If Soren does not win the election from any assembly seat, he will have to resign as chief minister within a month as the person who becomes the chief minister has to be elected from any assembly seat within six months

 a post shared by Sapna Choudhary (@isapnachaudhary) on Jul 28, 2018 at 8:28am PDT For the fourth time in a row, China has placed itself in the first line of opponents of India's security, after China vetoed Masood Azhar in the United Nations Security Council and vetoed Pakistan in every possible way
 jisase desh bhar main china ke prati gaharaa rosh or aakrosh punap rahaa he 
 Now, along with Pakistan, people are also considering China as an enemy of the country's security
 is aakrosh or rosh ko awaz dene ke liye confederation of india treders (CAIT) ne desh bhar main faile 40 hajaar se zyada vyapaarik sanghathan jo lagbhag 7 karod vyapaariyon kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai se chini vastuon ke bahishkaar kaa aahvaan kiya he
 On the occasion of Holi, CAT has also announced the burning of Holi of Chinese goods across the country on the next 19 March
 rajdhani dilli main yah kaarykram chini vastuon ke garh sadar bazaar main hoga
 This Holi will be lit by business organizations at about 1500 places across the country
 cat ne sarkaar se maang kii he ki pratham charan main china se aayaat hone vaali vastuon par 300 se 500 pratishat custom duty lagaai jaae or china se hone vaale aayaat par kadi nazar rakhi jaae kyonki isamen badi maatra main hawala ke len dein kaa andeshaa he
 CAT has also demanded from the government that the government give a special package to domestic small scale industries to reduce dependence on Chinese goods and raw materials
 cat ke rashtriya adhyaksh bi si bharatiyaa evam rashtriya mahaamantri praveen khandelwal ne enditivi ko bataaya kii china se aayaat hone vaali vastuven kuch bade gambhir sawaal khadaa karte hai jisamen mukhya rup se kya jo saamaan aayaat ho rahaa he wo vastav main desh kii arthvyavastha or vikaas ke liye behad jaruri he , kya sarkaar ko china se aayaat hone vaali vastuon par sahi rup se rajasav mil rahaa he, kya china se aayaat kaa hawala se koi len dein he, kya china ke niryaatkon ko jo paisa diya jaataa he kahin wo bharat main aatanki gatividhiyon ko panpane main upyog to nahin hota !bharatiyaa evam khandelwal ne kaha kii varsh 1991 main jab desh kii arthvyavastha ke dwaar vaishvik vyapaar ke liye khole gaye the tab yah bahut spasht tha ki keval jin project main badi laagat kii aavashyaktaa he, un kshatron main jahaan ucch str kii technology kii aavashyaktaa he tathaa un kshetron main jahaan rojgaar badi maatra main badhegaa keval inhi teen kshetro main vaishvik vyapaar ko anumati di jaayegi 
 It is sad that these three have no place in the case of China
 china se jo aayaat hota he wo badi maatra main wo saadhaaran se vasteen hai jo aam upyog main laai jaati hai
 No one is going to see that the goods that come from China are of good quality or not
 yadi china kii vastuon kii quality ko parkhaa jaae to hamaare swadeshi utpaada kahin behatar sabit honge or hamen china se aayaat kii jarurat hi nahin padegi
 He further said that it has also been observed that the price of goods imported from China is much lower than the reality, due to which their valuation is much lower at the Indian port and according to that there is custom duty and IGST
 Which makes the government feel a lot of revenue
 isamen nishchit rup se adhikariyon kii mileebhagat rahati he
 Therefore, Chinese goods are sold cheaper in the market because domestic products are fully taxed
 yah baat is baat se sabit hoti he kii jo log bhartiya port par ijiasti dete hai wo aam taur par ijiasti kaa clem nahin lete
 This clearly shows that there is a huge disturbance in imports from China
 isliye cat sarkaar se is maamle kii ek ucchstareey jaanch karaane kaa maang karti he
 In Jammu and Kashmir, terrorists have started a new trick to target family members of policemen

 Vishwa Rang, the recently held week-long literature and art event in Bhopal, made a lot of headlines
 udghaatan kaa diya jalane se pehle hi soshal media par pragatisheel kaviyon-lekhakon kaa ek dhada yah kehete hue tut padaa ki isamen korporate kaa karodon rupaya laga he; litguest ab dhandha ban chuke hai; is utsav ke koi vichaar nahin; makasad saahityetar he, isamen dakshinpanthiyon ko zyada tavajjo di gai he, aadi-aadi
 Even animal symbols were used against each other
 isaki yojana banane main shaamil rahe kuch ahm naamon ne bhi ain maukey par apane ko kinare kar liya
 Such protests in protest brought Santosh Choubey, the central organizer of this promissory titled Tagore International Literature and Arts Festival
 choube sahitya, samskruti or ucch shiksha ke kshetra main madhya pradesh ke ek pramukh naam hai
 He is the Chancellor of the AISECT Group of Universities affiliated to Higher Education
 isi group ke bhopal sthit rabindranath tagore vishvavidhyalay ne yah aayojan kiya tha
 He is the chairman, convener or patron of a dozen literary-cultural units
 saal main kavita paath, locarpan, pustak charchaa or aise bisiyon aayojan ve bhopal or anyatra bhi karte rahete hai or khud ke centre main hone ko ‘angvoy’ karte hai
 Some people in literary circles also call him an 'extremely self-possessed person'
 ve bolte bhi khub hai
 But on this occasion, apart from putting his side on Facebook, he thought it appropriate to remain silent
 baad main unhone bhi apana paksh rakhaa (jo report ke aakhir main he)
 Well, after the three-day extravaganza, the event created an atmosphere as soon as the main gathering started on November 8 in Minto Hall, the old assembly building of the state
 teen din main hindi kendrit saath satr
 More than a dozen Hindi teachers from abroad and as many overseas Indian writers
 (daawa to vaise bharat sahit ‘tees deshon ke 500 se adhik pratinidhi hastakshron’ ke aane kaa tha)
 As a string of events was also attached to Tagore, Gandhi, Iqbal and Faiz were joined with Tagore for a two-day long lecture session
 lekin charchaaon or rachana paath ke satron main jo baat thik se rekhaankit ho saki, vah thi haashie ke logon kii aawaaj
 Among these, the voices of Dalit literature, Kashmir, migrant writing and third gender spoke more resolutely
 third gender sahitya utsavon main ek taaja pravishti he
 And it also has a vocal voice from Bengal, headed by Manobi Bandhopadhyay, the principal of a college
 mukhya haul main 500 se zyada shrota third gender ke aadha darjan kaviyon-vaktaaon kii samvednaaen saajha karne ko maujuud the
 Especially the legend of Punjab's highly educated, Russian-educated and classical singer Dhananjay Chauhan with hot tongues, raping twenty people a night, being expelled from Punjab University and then getting the same admission as the first transgender in the same university
 When heard, the hall continued to echo with applause
 pravasi bhartiya lekhakon ke satr main ronaa hi is baat kaa tha ki ‘bataaie, pravasi lekhakon ko ek cote main yani arakshit shrenee main rakhkar doum darje kaa bataa diya jaataa he
 Literature should be seen in its entirety
 ham to bhartiya dharohar ko seene se lagaae ghoomte hai
 And the litterateurs here treat us like this
 ’ britain kii usharaaje saxena or jai verma ke baad haalanki divya maathur ne spasht kiya ki pravasi lekhak rahata he videsh main or sochataa he bharat kii; or yah ki videsh main rope die jane se paudha videshi nahin ho jaataa
 Tejendra Sharma, the leading voice of migrant writers, touched on the aspect of little ideology: "migrant stories are not written under ideological pressure to appease self-respecting critics
" yahaan daaen or baayen haath kaa koi chakkar nahin
 As a host, Choubey, who is interested for a while, usually arrives every season, also arrives, with a clear message to the expatriate writers: "I want you guys to get copies of Kathadesh in your country
" Move to is aagrah ko aap meri marketing technic bhi kah sakate hai
 "actually, this is the most important work in all the literature to be released on the occasion of Vishwa Rang
 isamen kareeb 200 saal kii pravaasiyon ko rekhaankit karti kahaniyaan or 70 aalochakon kii tippaniyan hai
 It includes contemporary critic Drs
 dhananjay verma ne kahani ke rup or kathy par baat kii he
 Chaubey was a little sad that the way Kathadesh should have been discussed did not happen
 par pravasi lekhakon ke manch par hi unhone ek or mahatvakankshi yojana spasht kar di: ‘‘vishwa rang ke baad ab ham katha vishwa ke aayojan ke bare main soch rahe hai
 Will do that too
 ’’naagarikta or visthaapan par kavita vaale satr main paath to hue hi, par ek saath agal-bagal baithe teen chehron par kuch alag-alag bhi saaf padhgaye main aa rahaa tha: kashmiri pandit maharaj krishna santoshi, ghati ke nida navaj or bich main baithe manohar batham, jo ki kashmir main seemaa suraksha bal ke afasar ke rup main rahe hai
 The three faces were like three points of view
 isi silsile main jab ‘kendriya paridrishy main haashie ke swar’ kii baat ai to rajasthan ke jaiprakash kardam ne sidhe-saaf shabdon main jo kaha, use sirf suna hi ja saktaa tha, kisi ke paas uskaa koi jawaab na tha
 Those who describe Vasudhaiva as a family, are divided among castes and circles
 
 
 kisi dalit ko paan chabane par to kisi ko moonch rakh lene par hi peet diya jaataa he
 Some teachers and students in the school called me 'oye Chamte'

 congress saansad somvaar ko bhi kaali pattee lagaakar apana virodh darj karaayenge, vahiin sansad main jari gatirodh khatm karne ke liye loksabhaadhyaksh sumitra mahajan phir sarvadaleey baithak bula sakati hai
 Waves of proverbs and old references are beating in the minds one after the other, but no wave is leaving an impression in which this victory of Arvind Kejriwal can be achieved
 tamaam lakeeren khinchne or un par rabar chalaane ke baad lagata he ki yah puraani raajnneeti kii vidaai he
 At least he is from Delhi
 congress shunya par aa gai, iskaa congress ko bhi achraj nahin he
 He is also happy that Rahul Gandhi's roadshow was successful and there is a loyalist like Ajay Maken in the party who agreed to become the goat of the Bali
 syapa bijepi ko lekar he, jo narendra modi kii lokapriyata ke shikhar par aisi prachand haar dekh rahi he, jaisi usne 1984 main indira gandhi kii hatya ke baad upji lahar main dekhi thi
 Then he had two seats left in the Lok Sabha, today he has 3 seats left in the assembly
 modi ke bahut se aalochak bhi daawey se yah nahin kah sakate ki pradhanmantri ne pichley nau maheene main dilli main aisa koun sa gunaah kar diya ki unki party kaa supada saaf ho jaae
 Yes, he did welcome Obama by wearing a suit of 10 lakh but it was not made an election issue by the Aam Aadmi Party
 ek paalane main jhulati party kii prachand jeet or do khurraat rashtriya dalon kaa safaya ekadam nae kism kii gutthi he, jise khud voter bhi nahin sulajhaa saktaa
 Yes, one thing is clear that Delhiites have given more than 60 seats to a party born from the agitation started four years ago
 vahiin dilli main 60 saal se upar ke vakt se raajnneeti kar rahe do puraane kism ke raajnneetik dalon ko nestnabud kar diya he
 So did the people of Delhi come out with the promise of ending politics and with the intention of bringing the rule of the people, Kejriwal liked it so much that he did not want to see the old political parties with a teary eye
 dilli kaa janadesh puri tarah se us andolankaaree ke saath he jisane janata se yah vaada kiya tha ki uske andolan kii disha ab sirf rachanaatmak hogi or usamen ghadi-ghadi sadq par utar jane ke tatv nahin honge
 The public believed that the politics of alcohol distribution, the politics of crowds of activists touching the feet of politicians, the politics of equating caste and religion, and the politics that people understand after the elections, they no longer need it
 use kandhe par bevajaah shawl latakaane vaale pradhanmantri or khamkhan aasteen chadhaane vaale yuvaraj kii jagah thand lagane par kaanon par mafalar kaa sahi upyog karne vaala netaa chahie
 If he wants that leader, instead of big rallies or road shows, Nukkad is insisting on meetings
 kul milakar yah ki modi ko pradhanmantri banane kaa mahaan armaan puraa karne ke baad janata ke paas puri gunjaaish nikal ai ki vah desh ke aalaa afasar se aam aadmi bane kejariwal ko apana dil de de
 But the relationship of the heart is very delicate
 kejariwal ne jitne bade vaade janata se kiye the janata ne un vaadon se bada bahumat unhen diya he
 The public has now become a Kadial Mahajan
 vah aapke vaadon kii saakh par aapako apana vot samarthan udhaar detii he, lekin tay miyaad par paise kaa ritern nahin aayaa to aapaki kurki karaane se baj nahin aati
 So far Sheila Dixit, Rahul Gandhi and Narendra Modi have seen this
 nae mizaaj kii janata puraani raajnneeti ko by-by jarur kar rahi he, lekin nai raajnneeti par puraani sharten aayad karne se baj nahin aegi
 Demand for free wi-fi will start in Delhi from tomorrow
 log kahenge ki unhen pizza kii home delivery se kahin teji ghar par ambulance pahunchane kaa intjaar he
 The people who show dictatorship in the vote will not tolerate long line of OPD in Delhi hospitals
 jhugagi vaale ab chahenge ki unki basti main tivi dekhne vaali jitani chhatariyaan lagi hai, utane shauchalay bhi bane
 They would also like their children to be children of people get good training like 
 or bhi bahut si acchhee baaten unke khwaabon main chaspa hai
 People are considering this as new politics and for this reason they have avoided old politics
 kejariwal sahab aapako dilli waalon ne 96 fisadi siten di hai, aapako kam se kam 48 fisadi vaade to nibhaane hi honge
 And the public will not tell how much time you have for this
 ise to aap modi ji kii chaay pite samay unheen se puch lenaa
 25 kg of heroin has been recovered under the guise of an Indian Police Service (IPS) officer caught by the police
 heroin kii taaja khep mumbai ke vasai ilaake ke nayagaanv flats se jabt kii gai he
 Police suspect that organized gangs may be behind this illegal business
 gauratlab he ki ravivaar ko ek ipie adhikari shaji ko herine ke saath giraftaar kiya gaya tha
 However, the entire matter is being investigated
 jurm kii duniya kaa itihaas kai khaufnak mujarimon kii karatuuton se bharaa padaa he
 These include such murderers, who murdered not one or two but many
 katl hi balki marane waalon kii laashon ke saath had darj kii haivaaniyat bhi dikhaai
 One such name is that of Russia's notorious serial killer Andrei Shikatilo
 rus main ye naam kisi khauf se kam nahin he
 He used to kill women first
 phir unki laash ke saath shaareerik sambandh banaata tha
 Andrei Chicatillo was born on 16 October 1936 in Ukraine, Soviet Russia
 vah peshey se teacher tha
 But he suffered from a sexually inferiority complex in childhood
 isi kaa nateeja tha ki wo har vakt isi bare main sochataa tha
 His head used to get obsessed
 jisamen wo kuch bhi kar guzarane ko taiyaar rahata tha
 This was the reason that he was addicted to killing women by killing his lust
 rus ke aapraadhik itihaas ke aankde bataate hai ki andrei shikatilo 1978 se 1990 ke bich 56 se zyada logon kii hatyaein kii thim
 There were more women on his target
 vah drugs ke bahaane mahilaon ko apane jaal main fansaakar unki hatya kar detaa
 He had a strange kind of hobby
 wo katl se pehle mahilaon ko nirvastr kar detaa tha
 Then he used to tie his arms and legs
 iske baad jab tak mahila kuch samaj paati, wo uskaa katl kar detaa tha
 After the murder, he had a physical relationship with the woman's corpse
 apni havas mitaane ke baad andrei apane shikaar kii ankhen nikaal letaa tha
 After that he used to cut off the private part of the woman
 maano us vakt uske sir par shaitan savaar ho jaataa tha
 According to Russian police records Andrei Shikatilo made his first victim in 1981 a 17-year-old girl
 apni ghinauni or khaufnak vaardaaton se wo itnaa badnaam hua ki use buchar of rostov, di red reeper or di rostov reeper ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa tha
 But they say that there are no feet of crime
 aakhir ek din ye sanakee hatyara police ke hathe chadh hi gaya
 The police arrested Andrei Chicatillo on 20 November 1990
 hairaani kii baat ye thi ki pakade jane ke baavjood usne apana jurm kabool nahin kiya tha
 The case went on in court
 lekin 14 farvari, 1994 ko use uske gunahon kii sajaa mil gai
 He was shot and killed in his head
 phukare fame pulakit samraat apni personal life ko lekar aksar surkhiyon main rahete hai
 After splitting from Salman Khan's Rakhi sister Shweta Rohira, he was in a relationship with actress Yami Gautam
 lekin kuch samay baad donon ne brallep kar liya
 Their breakup was very much in the news
 ab pulakit ke kisi or actress ke saath rileshship kii khabaren charchaa main hai
 According to Spotboye's news, Pulkit split from Yami due to family pressure
 lekin ab unki life main ek actress ne entry kii he
 It is reported that Pulkit actress is in a relationship with Kriti Kharbanda
 donon ek-duusare ko date kar rahe hai
 The two are often seen together
 pulakit ke berthde par kriti ne chennai jaakar unhen sarprise bhi diya tha
 Even Kriti is now taking training from Pulkit's personal trainer Sameer Hansari
 haalanki, donon ne abhi tak apane relation kii aadhikarik pushti nahin kii he
 Pulkit also seems to be avoiding talking about it
 bataa den ki donon ne film veere di wedding main saath kaam kiya tha
 Now pulkit-kriti is going to be seen together again
 wo diarector anis bajmi kii film paagalpanti main najar aane vaali hai
 It is a comedy
 report ke mutabik film kii shooting is maheene shuru ho gai he
 The film is multistarrer

 Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) Lok Sabha MP Pappu Yadav has read in the pride of Aam Aadmi Party leader Arvind Kejriwal that Kejriwal is needed to compete with Narendra Modi
 pappu yadav kii nazar main kejariwal desh ke 42 karod naujavaanon ke mahanayake hai or modi ke jhooth se ladane ke liye desh ko unki sakht zarurat he
 Pappu Yadav's suggestion is to integrate Kejriwal with him along with the integration of Janata Parivar, only then the new front will be able to give a strong fight to Modi
 gyaat ho ki janata dal parivaar ko jodne kii kavayad chal rahi he
 All parties like JDU, JDS, RJD, Samajwadi Party are trying to form a strong party
 mulaayam ke ghar is silsile main ek badi baithak bhi ho chuki he
 Till now it is believed that its command will be in the hands of Mulayam Singh Yadav
 pappu yadav, mulaayam singh yadav ke netritv par koi sidhaa sawaal nahin uthaa rahe, lekin unki raay he ki kejariwal ko aage karne se un naujavaanon tak pahunchaa ja sakegaa, jo lakhon kii taadaad main kejariwal se jude hai
 Asked how Kejriwal, who accused Mulayam and Lalu not only of familyism, but also whipped them fiercely for corruption, how can Mulayam and Lalu take him along, Pappu Yadav said in flat words Small things should be forgotten
 is sawaal par ki kejariwal hi kyon aisi partiyon se judenge, jin par vah barasate rahe hai, pappu yadav ne kaha ki kejariwal ko raajnneetik morchebandi kii vyaharikta ko samajhnaa hoga
 Praising Kejriwal's 49-day rule in Delhi, Pappu Yadav says he fought the system and tried to change it
 unke andar kaa yahi gun unhen mahanayake banaata he
 But now the question is, why did he start giving his heroism to the leaders whom Kejriwal has been describing as villains
 asal main chunavi haar se kamazor pade lalu apni party ke saansad ke is suzav ko anyathaa taur par lekar kisi tarah kii anushaasanamak karrwai karne kii sthiti main nahin hai

 baba ramdev ne bijepi ke piem ummidavaar or gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi kii jamkar tarif kya kii uttarakhand kii congress sarkaar ne unke khilaaf mukademon kii line laga di
 81 cases have been filed on behalf of Haridwar District Magistrate Nidhi Mani Tripathi for fraudulently buying land on Ramdev's trust
 vaise to ramdev ke upar kai saalon se shikaayatein or aniyamitataayen aam baat he, lekin buudhvaar ko achaanak uttarakhand ke mukhyamantri vijay bahuguna ne baba ramdev ke upar kiye gaye mukademon ke liye ek vishesh press conference bula kar jaankaree dete hue unke upar mukademe darj hone ki baat kahi
 Vijay Bahuguna accused Ramdev of being very clever and vicious and accused him that he bought land in Haridwar and many places in the area of aurangabad and wrongly traded money
 vijay bahuguna ne bade talkh andaaj main ramdev ke upar 10 karod rupee ke her-pher kaa bhi iljaam lagaaya, saath hi ek hafte main kai or mukademe darj hone kii baat bhi sweekaar kii
 If we look at such a large number of lawsuits filed over Ramdev's trust with the coming Lok Sabha elections, then somewhere the BJP has got another issue
 dilli ke ramlila maidan vaali ghatana ke baad se hi ramdev congress kii ankhon kii kirakiri bane hue the or phir narendra modi kii tarifon ke pul baandhakar wo ek baar phir uttarakhand kii congress sarkaar ko apana dushman bana baithe hai
 What is the truth, it will be known only after investigation, but the phase of troubles over Ramdev has already started, at least in Uttarakhand
 punjab or goa main jabardast voting ke saath paanch rajyon main vidhansabha chunaavon kii shandaar shuruyaat hui he
 Now everyone's eyes are on Uttar Pradesh, the largest state in the country
 uttar pradesh main 11 farvari ko pehle charan kii voting hogi jisamen aligarh, meerut, bagpat samet 15 jilon kii 73 vidhansabha siton par voting honi he
 All political parties are trying to attract voters by pouring their full strength on the strength of their star campaigners
 pradesh main aisi kai siten hai jahaan par kisi bhi party ke liye jeetna shubh hota he, jisase rajya main uski sarkaar ban sake
 One such seat is the Hastinapur assembly constituency of Meerut district, where voting is also held in the first phase itself
 agar abhi tak ke chunavi itihaas ko dekhen to adhiktar baar ye hua he ki jis bhi party ko hastinapur vidhansabha seat par jeet mili he usee party kii sarkaar lakhanu main bani he
 What is said, the first elections were held in 1952 in the country but there was no Hastinapur assembly constituency then
 lekin 1957 ke chunaavon main hastinapur ko vidhansabha kaa darja mila or yah pradesh ke chunavi nakshe par aayaa
 In 1957, 1962 and 1967, the Congress candidate from Hastinapur won, then the Congress government was formed in Lucknow and Sampurnanand, Chandrabhanu Gupta, Charan Singh became the Chief Minister respectively
 vahiin 1969 main hue chunaavon main yahaan bhartiya kranti dal ke pratyaashee ne jeet darj kii or rajya main bhartiya kranti dal kii sarkaar bani or choudhary charan singh mukhyamantri bane
 The JP movement also won the Congress candidate in 1974, ND Tiwari of the Congress became the Chief Minister, in 1977 the JP movement showed its impact here and won the Janata Dal candidate from here and Ramnaresh Yadav of the Janata Dal in Lucknow became the Chief Minister
 1980, 1985 main congress ne apni jeet doharaai or rajya kii satta main uski vaapasi hui
 In 1989, Janta Dal MLA won from Hastinapur, then Mulayam Singh became Chief Minister on behalf of Janata Dal in Lucknow
 vahiin 1991 main kuch samay ke liye kalyaan singh mukhyamantri bane par babari masjid vidhwans ke kaaran unhen hatana padaa or 1993 tak rajya main raashtrapati shashan rahaa to chunaav nahin ho sake
 The entry of regional parties has been dominated by regional parties in the state since 1993, while in Hastinapur elections in 1996, independent candidates won and unstable government was formed in Lucknow, during which Mayawati, Kalyan Singh, Rajnath Singh became Chief Minister and President's rule was also imposed
 
 2002 main yahaan se sapa pratyaashee jeeta to rajya main pehle sapa ke samarthan se mayawati mukhyamantri bani par baad main mulaayam singh hi mukhyamantri bane
 Then in 2007, the BSP and the SP candidates won, then their government was also formed in the state respectively
 ab koun hai maidan main2017 chunaavon ke liye samaajawaadee party ne apane maujuuda vidhayak prabhudayal valmiki par bharosa jataayaa he to basapa se purv vidhayak yogesh verma maidan main hai
 On behalf of BJP, Dinesh Khatik and RLD have made Kusum Pradhan their candidate
 kyon khaas he hastinapur?hastinapur kaa mahabharat kaa apana itihaas rahaa he, isemahabharatakalindharti bhi kaha jaataa he to yahaan par jain dharm kaa pavitra sthaan jambudweep bhi he
 From tourism point of view, Hastinapur has great importance
 abhi haal hi main pesh kiye gaye bajet main centre sarkaar ne hastinapur ko railway line se jodne kii pichley 60 varshon kii maang ko puraa kiya he

 For Iran, Sardar Ajmoon (29th), Andranik Temorian (47th) and Mehdi Taremi (51st minute) scored goals
 irani team ne bina sangharsh kiye aasaani se teen ank hasil kiye
 With this, he has topped Group d with a total of seven points in three matches
 bharat group main paanchave or aakhri sthaan par he
 There was a very slow game in the first half
 donon tiimon ne ek duusare ko parakhane main samay lagaaya
 In front of physically strong Iran, Indian captain Sunil Kshetri got the ball a few yards away from the goal but his shot went well beyond the goalpost
 iran ne khel ke 29wein minute main pehla gol daaga jabaki sardaar ajooman ne free kik ko header se gol main pahunchaaya
 Even after this, Iran tried hard to score the next goal but the Indian defenders managed to defend somehow
 isse madhyantar tak score 1-0 se iran ke paksh main rahaa
 Iran scored two goals early in the second half which ensured India's defeat
 iran ne is half main aakraamak shuruuaat kii jiskaa use turant phayda bhi mila
 He kept the ball in the Indian box continuously and eventually the team scored 2–0 by Temorian
 bhartiya rakshapankti teetar bitar si ho gai jabaki iran ne akraman jari rakhaa
 In such a situation, Taremi got the ball in the box and he made no mistake in putting it in the goal
 tippaniyan It can be a relief for India, the 155th team in the world, that his defense kept the Iranian forward for most of the match and did not allow much goals
 bhartiya team ne apni taraf se sarvshereshth prayaas kiye lekin inamen aisa kuch nahin tha jisase ki iran ke liye khatra paidaa ho
 Iran on the other hand did not take any kind of laxity
 unhone gend par adhiktar samay niyantran banaae rakhaa or sabit kiya ki vah aakhir main asia kii sarvshereshth ranking kii team kyon hai

 The law for the NRC was made by the Central Government in the year 2003, the law will be prepared by doing the door-to-door survey, the National Register of Citizens Register does not require the government to enact any new law for the NRC
 supreme court ke senior edwocket upamanyu hajarika ne bataaya ki saal 2003 main centre sarkaar ne citigenship (registration of citigens and ishyu of neshnal idi cards) rules 2003 banaaya tha
 Under this rule, NRC will be implemented through door-to-door survey
 senior edwocket hajarika ne kaha ki enarasi ko lagu karne ke liye alag se kanoon banane kii jarurat nahin he
 Under this, if there is no doubt on the citizenship of anyone, then it is assumed that people living in India are citizens
 haalanki agar kisi kii naagarikta par kisi tarah kii koi ashanka hoti he, to uski jaanch padtaal kii jaati he
 Hazarika said that under the rule of 2003, no special document is required to be given name in NRC
 isaki vajah yah he ki enarasi door-tu-door survey ke jariye taiyaar kiya jaataa he
 Advocate Hazarika says that as far as Assam is concerned about NRC, infiltration is a big problem there
 lihaaja saal 2009 main is niyam main sudhaar kiya gaya tha or naagarikta sabit karne ke liye kuch dastavej jaruri kar diya gaya tha
 Let us tell you that violent protests are taking place in many states of the country regarding the Citizenship Amendment Act and NRC
 pradarshnkaree lagaataar aagjanee or todphod kar rahe hai
 Police are being pelted at many places
 naagarikta sanshodhan adhiniumaur enarasi ke khilaaf chaatr bhi sadak par utre hue hai or pradarshan kar rahe hai
 In Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Assam, police have to fire tear gas to control the protesters
 lekin pradarshan khatm hone kaa naam nahin le rahaa he
 Political parties are also constantly attacking and targeting the Modi government
 jane maane kavi or apane pitaaharivansh raay bachchanaki ‘madhushaala’ kii apni aawaaj main ricarding kar rahe superstashmitabh bachchankaa kahana he ki unhen pakkaa nahin pataa ki kavitaayen aaj ke yuvaaon ke liye praasangik hai yaa nahin
 69-year-old Bachchan is working towards popularizing his father's poems but he himself is not sure but whether these compositions will be liked by the current generation

 lekin jab koi mukhyamantri aise bayanon ko apanaataa he to ye gambhir aparaadh ho jaataa he kyonki phir ye bayaan sahi maane jate hai
 i was forced to take legal action repeatedly on making false allegations
 ram ne didisie or bedi ke aaropon par akhbaar main chhapi khabaron ko padhaa Jaitley: i have nothing to do with them, it is in 2015, when i left the post of DDCA President in 2013
 ram ne phir seetaram yechuri kaa twit sunaaya jo kejariwal ne retweet kiya
 Read the tweet by Madhu Kishwar, which was also retweeted by Kejriwal
 jetali : ye twit kaaphi manahani vaala he or mukhyamantri ke retveit karne se juthi baton ko or bhi bal miltaa he
 The arguments in this case started in the court on 6 March
 us dauraan varisht vakil ramjethamlani kii taraf se arun jetali ke liye 52 sawaal rakhe gaye
 Out of these 30 questions related to the case, one-third of the questions were disqualified from the court
 kam se kam do ghante tak chali us bahes main jetali ko yah samajhane ke liye kaha gaya ki vah kis tarah apni pratishtha ko pahunchi thes ke liye kah rahe hai ki'uski bharpai nahin ho sakati?or use aanka nahin ja saktaa
 'else, it is not a matter of' thinking yourself great '
 purv bijepi netaa ram jethlamalani is cese ko kejariwal kii taraf se lard rahe hai or unhone bina kisi sankoch ke jetali se is sawaal ke jawaab kii maang kii ki manahani kaa daawa kyon?is maamle par arun jetali kaa kahana tha ki puure raajnneetik jivan main aalochana ko lekar kuch nahin kaha,lekin is baar mujhe court aakar manahani kaa cese karnaa padaa,kyonki is baar meri nishtha or sachai par sawaal khadey kiye gaye
 What is the matter aam aadmi party ne aarope lagaaya he ki jab jetali dilli cricket body (ddca)ke pramukh the tab vah or unka parivaar sanstha main aarthik kuprabandhan ke liye jimmedaar the
 On this, Jaitley filed a defamation suit demanding Rs 10 crore
 pichhali sunwaayee main dilli ke siem arvind kejariwal ne jetali or unke parivaar ke bank vivaran or tex riterns kii maang kii thi
 Jaitley: This tweet is very defamatory and the retribution of the Chief Minister gives added strength to the lies

 During that time 52 questions were raised for Arun Jaitley on behalf of senior advocate Ramjethmalani
 inamen se 30 cese se jude sawaal lage,ek-tihaai sawaalon ko court kii taraf se ayogy qaraar diya gaya
 In the debate that lasted for at least two hours, Jaitley was asked to explain how he was hurting his reputation by saying that 'he cannot be compensated'
 And it cannot be judged
 'or kahin yah maamla'khud ko mahaan samajhane'kaa to nahin he
 Former BJP leader Ram Jethalmalani is fighting this case on behalf of Kejriwal and without any hesitation asked Jaitley to answer the question why the claim of defamation? On this matter, Arun Jaitley said that he did not say anything about criticism in political life, but this time i had to come to court and file a defamation case, because this time my loyalty and truth were questioned
 kya he maamla The Aam Aadmi Party has alleged that when Jaitley was the head of the Delhi Cricket Body (DDCA), he and his family were responsible for financial mismanagement in the institution
 is par jetali ne manahani kaa mukadmaa daayar kiya jisamen 10 karod rupee kii maang kii gai he
 In the last hearing, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal demanded bank details and tax returns of Jaitley and his family

 isi ke baad iskaa bhandaphod hua or ye police ke hathe chadh gaya
 Virendra Kumar, originally from Rampur area of barabanki, has lost crores of rupees to many people with his exploits

 After being dismissed from his job as Shiksha Mitra, Virendra chose Lucknow as his new destination and opened a travel agency and then started driving ministers
 isi dauraan virendra ne apane aapako sapa ke varisht netaa ram gopal yadav kaa pie bataakar logon ko naukari dilaane or sarkari kaam karwaane kaa pralobhan dekar thagna shuru kiya kyonki virendra ke travel agency kii gaadiyaan kai mantri or vidhayakon ke saath lagi thi
 So people used to fall prey to it easily
 lekin jab usne pradesh ke do maujuuda vidhayakon ko mantri banavaane kaa jhansa diya to vah police ke radar par aa gaya
 When the police investigated, it was found that Ram Gopal Yadav did not have any PA named Virendra, after which the police got into action and arrested the fraudster, two four wheelers from his possession, letter pads of honorable, sims of different companies, in the Vidhan Sabha

 Companies from both countries are going to enter into agreements worth $ 16 billion
 bharat
 Wen, who arrived here today on a three-day visit to strengthen 'fragile' relations between China, said warmly, 'my journey in India is a journey of friendship and cooperation
 bharat main china ke rajdoot chang yaan ne kal kaha tha ki donon deshon ke ‘najuk sambandhon’ main ‘khaas khyaal rakhane’ kii jarurat he
 Yesterday, preparing to hold a summit with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Wen also dismissed the comparison of 'dragon' and 'elephant' between China and India
 yahaan udyog mandalon dwaara yojit ek baithak main donon deshon ke udyogpatiyon ko sambodhit karte hue wain ne kaha, ‘china or bharat sahyog ke liye saajheedaar hai na ki ek-duusare ke pratispardhi
 There is enough scope in the world for the progress and cooperation of both the countries
 ’unhone kaha ki kuch log china or bharat ko aarthik pratispardhi ke taur par pradarshit kar rahe hai or donon deshon kii tulana dragon or hathi se karte hai

 is baar vajah ban saktaa he myanmar
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi is going to visit Myanmar on 5 September
 vah myanmar ke teen shaharon kaa daura karenge
 The visit comes at a time when India is looking to expand its strategic and industrial ties with Myanmar
 vahiin, duusari taraf, china ke saath myanmar kii berukhi badhati ja rahi he
 It is important for both countries that Myanmar Myanmar is considered a gateway to south-east Asia for India
 china ke liye bhi yah ranneetik ahmiyat rakhata he
 In such a situation, not only India, but China is also busy expanding its scope here
 myanmar china kii van belt van rod pariyojna kaa ek ahm padaav he
 In such a situation, both countries would like Myanmar to stand with them
 maujuuda samay main jis tarah ke halaat paidaa hue hai, unase to yahi lagata he ki ekbar phir bharat or china aamane saamne aa sakate hai
 Chinese infrastructure projects are also underway in China
 1990 ke dashak se donon desh saath milakar kai infrastracchar projects par kaam kar rahe hai
 But now China has also started its own responsibility for these projects
 isse myanmar ke saamne karj main doobane kaa sankat paidaa ho gaya he
 In fact, China is seeking more share in the Kyok Pew port being built in Myanmar
 vah myanmar par dabaav daal rahaa he ki use is bandargah kii 70 se 85 fisadi hissedari mili
 Whereas earlier this share was fixed at 50:50 percent
 isse china kii taraf se myanmar ke man main berukhi paidaa ho gai he
 Rohingya terrorists are supported by China
 For years Rohingya has been battling terrorist activities of terrorists
 ye kisi se chupa nahin he ki china in aatankiyon ko teror funding karata he
 On the other hand, India has always stood with Myanmar against Rohingya terrorists
 aise main bharat myanmar kaa sahyog kar use apane saath le saktaa he
 With India's cooperation, Myanmar can openly oppose China's aggression
 ye bhi padhein : bharat ne kaise baatcheet se hi doklam par dhili kar di china kii akadaise ho saktaa he takaravek taraf jahaan china kii dadagiri kii vajah se myanmar ke man main berukhi badhati ja rahi he
 At the same time, he has been constantly assured of cooperation from India
 ab beijing kyoke pu bandargah main apni hissedari badhaane par ada rahata he, to myanmar karj main dub saktaa he
 In such a situation, PM Modi assures him on his visit to help him get out of this crisis, then China will not like it
 china yahaan bhi bharat par uski ranneeti main dakhal dene kaa aarope laga saktaa he
 This is sure to cause a confrontation between the two countries once again

 The controversy started over the Sikkim border is continuously increasing

 Now on Wednesday, the Chinese Foreign Ministry has accused India of breaking the Panchsheel agreement, China says that India had laid its foundation and India is breaking it
 63 saal pehle hua ye panchasheel samjhauta aakhir kya tha, yahaan samajhen
 
 
 
 panchasheel samjhaute par 63 saal pehle 29 april 1954 ko hastakshar hue the
 This agreement was about trade and mutual relations between Tibet and India, the territory of China
 isamen paanch siddhant the jo agle paanch saal tak bharat kii videsh niti kii ridh rahe the
 The agreement was led by the then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, between China's first Premier (prime Minister) Chow Enlai
 is samjhaute ke baad hi hindi-chini bhai-bhai ke naare lage the or bharat ne gut nirpeksh ravaiya apanaaya
 However, in the war with China in 1962, the original spirit of this treaty was severely hurt
 darasal, panchasheel shabd aitihaasik buddha abhilekhon se liya gaya he jo ki buddha bhikshuon kaa vyavhaar nirdhaarit karne vaale paanch nishedh hote hai
 Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru took the word from there itself
 is samjhaute ke bare main 31 disambar 1953 or 29 april 1954 ko baithken hui thim jiske baad beijing main is par hastakshar hue
 These 5 main points were important 1 in Panchsheel issue
 ek duusare kii akhandta or samprabhutaa kaa sammaan2
 Mutual degradation 3
 ek duusare ke aantarik maamalon main hastkshep nahin karnaa4
 Equal and mutually beneficial relationship 5
 shantipurna sah-astitvais samjhaute ke tahat bharat ne tibet ko china kaa ek kshetra sweekaar kiya tha, is tarah us samay is sandhi ne bharat or china ke sambandhon ke tanaav ko kaaphi had tak dur kar diya tha
 China threatened China Earlier on Wednesday, China's official newspaper Global Times said that the time has come to teach India a lesson once again
 is baar bharat kaa 1962 se bhi zyada bura haal kiya jayega
 Recently, after the statement of the Defense Minister of India Arun Jaitley, such a sharp comment of the Chinese newspaper has been seen
 darasal, sikkim sector par tanaav ke baad china ne bharat ko 1962 kii haar kii yaad dilaai thi, jiske jawaab main raksha mantri jetali ne kaha tha ki 1962 se ab ke halaat alag hai
 India should not forget to understand the country of 1962
 ye maamle 28 july ko supreme court dwaara die gaye us faisle par aadhaarit hai jinamein sharif ko ayogy ghoshit kiya gaya tha

 ) ab ise doston-saathiyon kaa dabaav kahen yaa phir dikhaave kaa shauk, lekin sachaai yah he ki bharat ke kareeb 10 karodamobile phonaupabhokta har saal nayasmart mobile phonekhreedne kaa lobh nahin chhod pate
 Whenever a new smart phone comes in the market, your pocket starts to clutter
 agar kharch karne main dikkat na ho, to ho saktaa he ki aap ek saath paanch se zyada phone ke maalik hon
 It is also possible that you are planning to sell your old phone and buy a new one
 sawaal yah nahin he ki aap kitne main apana phone bechnaa chaahate hai balki asli sawaal yah he ki dukandaar aapako kitne paise dene ko taiyaar he
 The market move is now upside down
 yah bazaar kharidaar kaa he, bechney vaale kaa nahin
 So if you are going to deal with your old phone for the first time, then you may come across shocking things
 isliye ham aapkosecond hand phonbazar kii talkh sachaaiyon se rou-ba-rou karaane ja rahe hai taaki aapako apane phone kii asli keemat kaa pataa chal sake
 Nowadays there is more demand for capacitive touchscreen, Android operating system, applications and good camera phones in the resale market
 dilli kii gaffaar market main puraane phone ke dealer hani singh bataate hai, ''ab kvarty keepad kii maang nahin rah gai he
 Older phone buyers ask for touchphones
 androed besd phonelokapriy hai or hamaare paas inaki kaaphi maang aati he
 "but if you have a domestic brand that you are tired of using, then what will you do?" Mohit Wadhwa, owner of Mobi Phone Network Pvt Ltd, Delhi, says, "the resale value of brands like Lava and Karbonn is not high in big cities
 ye phone apekshaakrit saste hote hai or kam chalate hai
 But their demand is very high in small cities, towns and villages
 ''unhone jo kaha, hamane khud use aajamaaya or sahi paaya
 We tried to sell some old Qwerty keypad and wifi phones from Micromax and Lemon
 adhiktar dukandaaron ne to naam sunate hi unhen lene se inkaar kar diya, kuch ne poocha, ''kya micromax bling 2 he? kya aapkaa lemon vaala phone androed besd he?'' bharat main mobile phone ke sabase bade ricel bazaar dilli kii gaffaar market main adhiktar dukandaar in brands ko lekar sashankit the
 One said, "we do not deal in such small or Chinese brands
 nokia yaa samsung ho to dikhaaiye
 "finally we found a shopkeeper who valued them at Rs
 800
 lagaaya (jabaki vaastavik daam 5000 ru
 Was)
 chunki ve phone bilkul nae se dikhte the or thik se kaam kar rahe the, isliye ham unka sauda 1,000 ru
 i could do it
 lekin ek baat kaa dhyaan rakhana hoga
 If the phone is scratched or its original packing and accessories are missing, it is no better than litter
 teji se ubharate mobile handset bazaar kaa puraa paridrishy ab badal chukaa he
 Remember when it was so easy to sell an old phone
 aam taur par nokia kaa koi lokapriy model apane daam kaa 60 fisadi tak nikaal letaa tha jabaki nichle brands bhi 40 fisadi tak par bik hi jate the
 Now this method does not work because now there is demand for operating system and new model
 saare lokapriy plateformon main androed or ioes kii second hand bazaar main baari maang he, iske baavjood yah kuch nishchit kism ke phone tak hi simit he
 For example, the resale value of Samsung Galaxy S-2 and Galaxy Note is far better
 agar aapke paas aipal kaa iphone 4es yaa iphone 4 ho, to sauda karne main majaa aayega lekin achatisi incredibal es, evo 3di, soni arikson arq es yaa experia kii keemat aapke soch ke mutabik nahin mil paaegi
 Nokia has suffered the most in the resale market
 pehle jo nokia sabase zyada demand main hota tha, aaj kharidaar use sabase ant main tarjeeh dete hai
 If you have Nokia's set working on Symbian platform, then you will be able to get 30% of its current price in the market
 yadi vah model ab band ho chukaa he, to uski aakhri keemat kaa 30 fisadi mil paaegaa
 Nokia E7 now Rs 7,000 without any scratch
 se 9,000 ru
 Will be able to get back between Rs
 19,500 and its last price is Rs
 19,500
 thi
 Some popular Nokia N8s from him are also priced at Rs 8,000
 main hi nikal rahaa he
 The condition of Nokia's Windows Phone or other brand is no different
 inamen maujuuda keemat kaa 50 fisadi hi nikal paaegaa, bhale hi aapkaa phone das din yaa maheene bhar purana ho
 If there are scratches on the body, the price will be further reduced
 is maamle main research in moshan (rim) kablikaberibhi lokapriy nahin he
 Only with the blackberry 8520 can you expect three to three and a half thousand, that too when you have the original bill and box
 mumbai ke mahesh telecom ke manish kehete hai, ''second hand cellphone kharidne vaale kam daam par zyada feechar maangate hai
 They even demand the best-selling model such as the Samsung Galaxy S2 or Apple iphone 4 / 4S
 ''ab aapako andaja lag gaya hoga ki puraane phone kaa daam vasuulana aasaan nahin he
 But by trying our tips, you can get a better price for your phone

 unhone kaha ki party netritv tay karegaa ki jin mantriyon kii sanghathan se chuttee hui he, unako kya role dena he
 All these are our respected senior leaders in the state where they will be useful
 unka upyog kiya jayega
 'I want to go to the party for coordination dialogue' Pandey said that in Uttar Pradesh we will take all sections together

 " pichley kuch dinon se aap internet, tivi or akhabaaron main lagaataar duniya bhar main hue ranjamaware atake kii khabare lagaataar pard rahe honge
 This is quite serious and so far millions of computers in about 150 countries are affected by it
 havers paison ke liye computers ko nishaanaa bana rahe hai
 However, it is now being told that after the new update of Windows, it has been curbed
 lekin hamane kuch havers se baatcheet kii to unhone bataaya he ki is par lagaam lagaana aasaan nahin he
 It will spread like a virus and to prevent it, government institutions will have to think like hackers and they will have to answer in their own language
 is ranjamaware atake ke baad ek baar phir se Windows computers sawaalon ke ghere main hai
 Why is it that this attack happened only on a Windows computer? Why Apple's computers were not affected by this? The answer is clear
 microsoft ne kaaphi pehle hi Windows XP kaa saport band kar diya he
 And Microsoft's operating systems are the most pirated available
 lekin aisa aipal ke saath nahin he
 Most of the Apple computers or laptops are updated with the new version, so they are also not dangerous
 iske alaava pyrated mike oes bhi itani aasaani se nahin milte or chalan main bhi nahin he
 This is the most common reason why Apple's computers are more or less safe from this ransomware attack
 haalanki microsoft ne is ranjamaware se bachane ke liye march main hi security apadet jari kiya tha
 But most customers and institutions in India use pirated windows
 aise main sambhav security apadats unke liye bemaani hai
 Not only this, those who have the original Windows operating system also often ignore such updates
 kai baar aisa laaparvaahee main kiya jaataa he to kai baar internet slo hone kii vajah se
 Because such updates require broadband and its position in India is not hidden from anyone
 khatra tala nahin habhale hi aisa lag rahaa he ki ab ranjamvayer atake khatm ho gaya he
 But this is not true
 kyonki havers ne kuch aisi khaamiyon ko pakad liya he jiske jariye wo ek baar phir se bade paimaane par sibar hamale kar sakate hai
 What is wannacry ransomware and how it works? The British Security Researcher says that it has stopped for some time, but it will increase in the coming time
 ise Wnaa Decrypt, wannacryptro yaa WCRY ke bhi naam se janaa jaataa he
 Like other rangware, it can block a computer until it gets paid
 kahaan se aayaa he ranzvarethindots kii khaamiyon se niklaa he yah ranzware
 According to reports, the NSA had created a hacking tool which was leaked by some hackers known as shadow hackers
 hamane bharat ke ek athical haikar manan shah se is maamle par baatcheet kii he
 During this, he has told this
 kyon itani teji se failaa yah ranjamavarazyaadaatar ranjamaware verde yaa peedief files main chupe hote hanzinhen amuman email se bheja jaataa he
 Or the computers which are under the scanner of hackers, they pass it on to target computers
 abhi tak kitna hua he nuksaanek anumaan ke mutabik ab tak lagbhag 3 lakh computers or150 deshon ko nishaanaa banaaya gaya he
 Is Windows 10 also threatened by this? No, if you have updated Windows 10, then there is no risk for you
 kaise aap in atake se batch sakate hanmicrosoft ke mailaware protection centre ke mutabik in steps se aap khud ko isse bachaa sakate hanmicrosoft security essential jaise apadet anti virus software rakhen or ise apadet karte rahen
