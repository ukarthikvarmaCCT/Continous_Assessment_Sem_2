 Narendra Modi, who has commanded the throne of Gujarat for the third time, knows that it is necessary to win the hearts of the people to garner votes and this work cannot be done without public relations
 modi ye bhi jaanate hai ki jansampark kaa tarika agar hitech ho to apni baat kam samay main zyada se zyada logon tak pahunchaai ja sakati he or hitech tareekon ke istemaal ke maamle main modi kisi bhi duusare netaa se do kadam aage hai
 If Modi hangs out on Google Plus to increase contact with people, then through mobile applications, people also tell the government policies
 modi yuva voton kii takat pahachaanate hai or ye bhi jaanate hai naujavaanon se judana he to hitech hue bina kaam chalane vaala nahin
 Public relations with 3D technology is the result of this strategy of Modi

 ramayana par ramanujan kaa ek vivaadit niabandh haal hi main hindi main teen sau ramayana naam se prakashit hua he
 Apart from banning it in the course of Delhi University, there has been a lot of debate and debate about it
 hindi main ise chhapane kaa nirnay saahas bharaa tha or yah saahas dikhaane vaala koi umradraj vidwaan nahin, balki 25 saal kii ek ladki aditi maheshwari he, jo hindi prakaashan vyavsaay kii jakadanon ko todane main lagi he
 While Aditi was partially active in her father's business Vani Prakashan for a long time, but after completing her mphil from Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai, she has been fully involved with this job for the last two years
 khud ko feminist kehane vaali aditi kaa jor feminist (nariwadi) vishyon par kitaaben chhapane par he
 Not just poetry-story, philosophy, thoughts, history books are his priority
 30 varshiya priyanka malhotra landan skool of iconomics se media and communication main emessi karne ke baad apane parivaar ke paaramparik prakaashan hind pocket books ke kaam main lag gayi
 She says that the same product is successful today, which can attract youth
 'isliye ham aisi saral or upyogi kitaaben chhapane par jor de rahe hai, jise padhane main yuvaaon kii ruchi ho
 'there has always been a debate and controversy between writers and thinkers about the Hindi publishing business
 ek arase se aisa samajha jaataa rahaa he ki hindi prakaashan kisi jad ho chuki sanstha kii tarah kaam karata he
 Although the benefits of being the official language, government procurement of Hindi books has been the target of criticism
 lekin nai peedi in avadharanaon ko tod rahi he
 Alind Maheshwari, just 24 years old, is the youngest heir of Rajkamal, a major Hindi publication
 mumbai ke es
 P
 jain college se emb karne ke pehle hi pichley do saal se ve prakaashan kaa kaam sambhaal rahe hai
 Alind said, 'our aim is to make Hindi publication modern and professional
 ' unke kaam shuru karne se pehle prakaashan ke liye internet kisi duusari duniya kii baat thi
 Alind worked to move Hindi books into cyberspace
 prakaashan kii website banane, sabhi kitabon kii vistrut jaankaree website par uplabdh karwaane ke saath-saath online order kii shuruyaat kii, jiskaa rispance kaaphi shandaar he
 Not much, till 3-4 years ago, Flipkart and Shop 18, etc
 e-shopping sites were unknown to Hindi
 lekin aaj raajakmal samet hindi ke takreeban sabhi bade prakashkon kii kitaaben in websites par maujuud hai
 Alind says that the upcoming market is online
 isliye hindi prakaashan ko internet kii duniya main apane paanv or majboot karne honge
 a new thing was seen in the 2012 book fair
 praayah angreji ke stolon par najar aane vaale yaa chetan bhagat sareekhee kitabon kii firaaq main rahane vaale yuva is baar badi sankhya main hindi prakashkon ke stall par dikhaai die
 To find out the reason for this, it is known that the excellent packaging of Hindi books, the cover printed on excellent paper and designing are attracting the youth
 hindi ke liye yah nai cheez he
 Earlier, production quality was not an issue for Hindi publishers
 kaagaj itnaa kharaab hota tha ki 10-15 saal main hi pilaa padakar fatne lagata tha
 But now this scene is changing
 ab chamakdaar kaagaj, khubasurat cover or majboot packaging vaali kitaaben aam taur par najar aa rahi hai
 The 29-year-old Pranav Johri is currently handling the reins of Hindi publisher Rajpal & Sons celebrating 100 years of its publication
 america ke medicin main uniwarsity of visconsin se finance main masters karne ke baad pranav ke liye america main shandaar tankhwaah vaali badi naukariyon ke kaaphi maukey the
 But he chose a way to further his Hindi publishing business spanning four generations
 ve kehete hai, 'hindi kitaaben apni kharaab production quality ke kaaran pathakon ko aakarshith nahin kar paati thim
 i put a lot of emphasis on quality
 jo kitaaben hamane hindi or angreji donon main chhaapin, unke cover, quality, le-out vagairah ek jaise hi hai
 Now we can proudly say that Hindi books are not inferior to English in terms of production
 'agar hindi kitaaben kolkata sthit raja rammohan raay librari kii sarkari kharid kii jakadbandi se baahar aana chaahati hai or pustakaalayon main dhul nahin khaanaa chaahatin to hajaaron-hajaar pathakon ke haathon tak pahunchane ke liye unhen apane rup-rang ko sanvarna hi hoga
 Manoj Sharma, the young publisher of Kitabghar Publications, says, "any book in the library goes away, but if the attention is to grab the attention of the readers, the production quality will have to be great
 'vah jamaana doosraa tha jab inke dada or papa librari kharid main kitaaben bechakar santusht rahete the, lekin aaj sabhi yuva prakashkon kii yah chintaa or koshish he ki sasti paperbaque kitaaben chhapakar pathakon tak kaise pahunchaa jaae
 Alakind said, 'rajkamal used to emphasize hardbound earlier, but now we are printing hardbound and cheap paperback editions of all books simultaneously
 ' unke mutabik, hardbound librari ke liye durust he, lekin aam pathakon tak to sasti paperbaque kitabon ke jariye hi pahunchaa ja saktaa he
 At the same time, Alind has also done a new experiment
 unki yojana he desh bhar main chote-chote book-stores kii ek chen shuru karne kii
 It has started in Patparganj, Delhi
 alind kehete hai ki kitaaben hamen ghar-ghar pahunchaani hongi
 Stores like Landmark and Crossword will have to launch books among the public
 sterio tip nahin, modern or agressive tarika apnaanaa hoga
 According to Pranav, where Rajpal used to have 80 percent hardbound and 20 percent paperback books, now there are 70 percent paperback and only 30 percent hardbound
 aditi maheshwari ke liye sabase badi chintaa yah he ki sasti kitabon kii agressive marketing kii jaae
 Aditi is not only enough to print good books, she also has to reach people
 prakaashan santhaan ke rahul sharma (30 varsh), prabhaat prakaashan ke piyush kumaar (34 varsh) or diamond pocket books ke ankur verma (35 varsh) bhi marketing ko bijness kaa buniyadi funda maanate hai
 Apart from these big publishers of Hindi, Divya Arora of Natraj Publication, a small publication in Dehradun, is also working for Hindi in its own special way
 2009 ke landan book fere main yang publicing entrprenyor aword ke liye nominete ho chuki divya paryaavaran se judi mahatvapurn kitabon ko hindi main laane kaa kaam kar rahi hai
 The winds of change are flowing in Hindi
 aadhuniktaa ko kosne vaale koste rahen, lekin nai peedi ko pataa he ki vichaar se lekar vyavhaar tak main hindi kaa sabase bada sankat 'modernity' kaa abhaav hi he
 Now they are making Hindi modern
 bhartiya janata party (BJP) se janata dal (united) ke alag hone ke kuch hi der baad bijepi ne spasht kiya ki vah aagaamee loksabhaa chunaav ke liye gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi ko party kii prachaar samiti kaa adhyaksh banane ke faisle se peeche nahin hategi
 BJP Vice President Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said, 'BJP takes its own internal decisions
 jahaan tak rashtriya janatantric gathbandhan (endie) se jude muddon kii baat he to ham is par endie ke saath charchaa karte hai
 Naqvi said, 'whatever decision has been taken about Modi, we will not back down from it at any cost, whether the NDA is broken once or 10 times

 According to police sources, after the case was registered, only Indrajit and his associates made video of Charanjit Singh Chadha and the teacher viral on social media

 ab sarkaar ke liye rajyasabha se is bill ko paarit karana badi chunauti he
 What are the figures? Many political parties including Biju Janata Dal (BJD), AIADMK, SP and Trinamool Congress are opposing the triple talaq bill
 haalanki in raajnneetik dalon ke saansad loksabhaa main teen talaak bill main sanshodhan prastaav par voting ke dauraan anupasthit rahe
 The BJP does not have a majority in the Rajya Sabha
 aise main bill ko paas karaane ke liye duusare dalon ke saath kii jarurat he

 agar sarkaar ko apane sabhi sahyogi dalon kaa saath mil jaataa he, to bhi bill ko paarit karaane ke liye kam se kam 35 or saansadon ke samarthan kii jarurat hogi
 Owaisi had demanded six amendments
 AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi and some Congress leaders are also seeking amendments on the bill
 ovaisi ne to loksabhaa main teen talaak bill par chah sanshodhan prastaav pesh kiye, lekin unamem se sirf do sanshodhan prastaav ko hi sadan ne sweekaar kiya
 However, both Owaisi's amendment proposals were rejected
 unka kahana he ki yah bill muslim mahilaon ke saath anyaay he
 It violates the freedom of Muslims
 is bill ko taiyaar karne ke dauraan muslimon se salaah-mashvira nahin kiya gaya
 Muslim women celebrate Muslim women have been celebrating since the passage of the third divorce bill in the Lok Sabha
 haalanki abhi is bill ko rajyasabha main paarit karana jaruri he, jiske baad hi yah raashtrapati ke hastakshar ke saath kanoon kaa rup legaa paaegaa

 Two months ago, the Delhi High Court has disposed of all the petitions made during Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's sit-in at the dharna of the Lieutenant Governor
 hoicourt ne kaha ki dharna khatm ho chukaa he
 Hence, no further hearing is required in this case
 haalanki yachikakartaon kii taraf se kaha gaya ki dharna bhale hi khatm ho gaya ho, lekin court ko dharna sanvaidhanik tha yaa nahin, is par apana faisla sunaanaa chahie taaki aage bhi is tarah kii ghatnaon kii punrariti ho to kanoon or court kaa rukh saaf rahe
 Four petitions related to Kejriwal's dharna were filed in the Delhi High Court
 ek yachika main dharne ko lekar kya disha-nirdesh hone chahie yah bhi court ko tay karne kii guhaar lagaai gai thi
 But Acting Chief Justice Justice Geeta Mittal and Shri Hari Shankar said that whether or not the sit-in of the Lt
 Governor was constitutional or not, we do not want to hear these petitions
 dilli hai court ne kaha ki agar mukhyamantri dobaaraa dharne par baithte hai to phir yachikakarta dobaaraa court kaa rukh kar sakate hai
 The court said, "all citizens have the right to picket, but the petition was filed in the Delhi High Court because only the Chief Minister of Delhi sat on a dharna in the house of the Lt
 Governor with his ministers
" agar mukhyamantri dharne par nahin baithte to yah yachikaayen bhi court main nahin lagaai jaatin
 If the picket is over, we do not feel the need for further hearing on this
 is maamle main adishnal solicytor general aman lekhi ne kaha, ham congress kii tarj par is tarah kii yachikaaon ko lagaataar sunwaayee ke paksh main nahin hai
 The picket is also over
 lihaaja yachikaaon par aage sunwaayee kii jarurat he yaa nahin ye court khud tay kare
 It is worth mentioning that the petitions that were taken during Kejriwal's dharna were moved by the Delhi High Court
 vah dharne kii sanvaidhaniktaa or isko lekar guidelins banane kii maang ko lekar supreme court main bhi yachika laga chuke hai, lekin july main supreme court ne in sabhi yachikakartaon ko dobaaraa hoicourt bhej diya tha
 Karani Sena was founded in 2006 by Lokendra Singh Kalvi, son of former Union Minister late Kalyan Singh Kalvi
 pita kaalvi ne 1987 main rup kunwar kii ghatana ke baad sati pratha par pabandi ke khilaaf jabardast rajput andolan kii aguai kii thi
 Lokendra Alabatta has failed to reach his father's stature
 ve do baar chunaav haar gaye
 There have been movements from BJP to Congress and Congress to BJP
 abhi ve bhaajapa main hai, haalanki 2003 main unhone vasundhara raaje ke khilaaf ugr andolan kii aguai kii thi
 The 62-year-old Kalvi spent a few years in political Biaban when in the late '90s and early 2000s he teamed up with Devi Singh Bhatti, a powerful BJP MLA and Rajput leader from Bikaner
 The movement was waged in favor of reservation for unki reliyon ko acha samarthan mila or usase utsahit hokar donon ne bhaajapa kaa daaman chhodkar apni alag party saamaajik nyaay morcha banaai, jisane 2003 ke vidhansabha chunaav main 60 se zyada siton par apane ummidavaar khadey kiye
 But only Bhatti could win, due to which both later dissolved the party and returned to BJP
 jab aarakshan kaa mudda gaddinshin sarkaron par koi asar daalane main naakaam rahaa, tab 2006 main unhone rajput naujavaanon ko aakraamakata kaa put dene kii garaj se karani sena banaai
 Now with the issue of Padmavati, the Karni Sena saw it spread "across the country" as a "hindu fundamentalist organization fighting for national pride"
 kaalvi kehete hai, ''ham aakraamakata kaa sahaara tabhi lete hai jab hamaari shantipurna koshishon se bahere kaanon par jun tak nahin rengti
 "the Karni Sena began to draw attention around 2008 when it opposed Ashutosh Gowariker's film jodha-akbar, stating that Jodha was actually Jehangir's begum
 unheen dinon ke aasapaas ve bhaajapa chhodkar congress main shaamil ho gaye
 He returned to BJP again in 2014
 is saal july main ek lakh rajputon ne nagaur jile ke saanvarad gaanv main rajput sargana anand paal singh kii muthbhed main hui hatya ke khilaaf march nikaala tha
 He attacked police officers, including women, and the government was sweated away to control and pacify them
 anand paal ko jat aakraamakata ke rajput jawaab ke taur par dekha jaataa tha or vah thik usee vakt ubhara jab jaaton ko obisi kaa darja dene ko manjuuri di gai thi or jisase is jati samudaay ko panchayat raaj tathaa sthaneey nikaayon ke chunaavon main rajputon kii keemat par—yaa ve aisa hi maanate the—jabardast phayda mila tha
 The all-india backlash that Kalvi's protest against Padmavati has received should help increase his status as a Rajput leader
 bhaajapa rajputon main unki is apil ko bhunaane ke liye unhen party kaa padaadhikari banaakar inaam bhi de sakati he
 Kalvi is a hard-working leader, but given his temperamental nature, he could hardly convert it into votes for himself
 ek vajah yah bhi he ki aisi bahut kam siten hai, jinhen rajputon ke liye surakshit seat mana ja sake

 Examiners were unable to answer the questions of the Commission, when the Commission asked these examiners on what basis they examined the copies, while your educational qualifications were not of this level

 australia ke purv cricket captain ian chapel kaa maananaa he ki bharat ke test captain mahendra singh dhoni apane sheersh samay se guzar chuke hai or yah paanch-divasiy praaroop main viraat kohli ko purnakalik captain banane kaa sahi samay he
 India's caretaker captain Kohli scored a century in both innings of the first cricket Test against Australia and chased down the target on the final day, but despite this, the team suffered a 48-run defeat due to the collapse of the batting order in Adelaide
 
 chapel ne 'iespncricainfo' par apane kollam main likhaa, pichley saadhe teen din main kohli ke pradarshan se chayankarta bhi ab sochane lage honge ki yah unhen test cricket main purnakalik captaini saunpane kaa sahi samay he
 There is no doubt that Mahendra Singh Dhoni's top as Test captain has passed and it seems that this is the right time for a change
 unhone likhaa, bharat ke kaaryvahak captain lekin kshamtawan purnakalik netritvkarta kohli kii pari ke liye shaareerik rup se majbootee kii jarurat thi or unhone sir par gend lagane ke baad bhi shandaar shot khele
 Chappell, who captained Australia between 1971 and 1974, however, wrote that Kohli's inability to control emotions during the debate on the fourth day of the match caused some concerns
 chapel ne likhaa, captain ke rup main kohli ke bhavishya par hameshaa ek mudde kaa saaya rahaa he or edilade main bhi maidan par duusari baar bahes hone ke dauraan unki bhavanaaen un par haaavee ho gayi
 He wrote, For the first time, during the debate, Kohli kept his patience and acted wisely to calm his team's angry colleagues, but the second time his frustration prevailed over him

 landan olympic main bharat kii ummiido par khelmantri ajay maakan ne enditivi india se baatcheet karte hue kaha ki is baar sabase adhik khilaadiyon ne olympic ke liye qualifi kiya he or ummid he ki bharat kii jholii main pehle ke mukaable zyada padak aaenge
 On the controversy regarding the tennis team, Maken clearly said that any player should think about the country before making any statement
 sawaal : pehali baar bharat sarkaar ne suniyojit tareeke se olympic khelon kii taiyaari par paisa kharch kiya he
 Is there any assessment of players' ability to win medals? ajay maakan : 2008 ke beijing olympic ke liye 56 khilaadiyon ne qualifi kiya tha or is baar 81 khilaadiyon ne landan olympic ke liye qualifi kiya he
 Whichever player qualifies is world class in itself
 yah bahut badi uplabdhi he
 The players have worked hard this time
 un par bahut paisa bhi kharch kiya gaya he
 They have been provided with excellent coaches and other facilities
 uskaa nateeja yah hua he ki aaj tak kisi olympic khel ke liye itane zyada khilaadiyon ne qualifi nahin kiya tha
 i hope we do well
 sawaal : beijing khelon main hamen teen padak mili the
 How many medals are expected this time? maakan : padakon kii sankhya badhanaa bahut aasaan nahin hota he, lekin is baar qualifi karne vaale khilaadiyon kii sankhya 56 se badhkar 81 ho gai he
 It is obvious that our performance should be good this time
 lekin yah sab is baat par nirbhar karegaa ki us mahatvapurn kshan main hamaare khilaadi kaisaa pradarshan karte hai
 In my view, we are shooter, boxer, archer, wrestler, medal prospect
 sawaal : meri com number ek boxr hai
 
 
 Maken: Yes, i do expect com
 deepika kumari he
 Bandminton's doubles team is good
 sina nehwal bhi acha pradarshan kar rahi he
 Question: You mentioned Saina Nehwal


 The players who are going to the London Olympics, their families were not given tickets and passes to watch the game
 is vajah se bahut saare khilaadi niraash hai
 
 
 Maken: See, all of them come to the Indian Olympic Association (IOA)
 hamaara jo 10-sadasyeey aadhikarik dal is baar landan jayega, usamen saat purv olympian honge
 We have to ask for tickets from IOA for this delegation as well
 IOA hamen tikat degi, to ham vahaan jaaenge
 It is not that the government gets a ticket
 jo anbhigya hai ki kis tarah olympic kaa aayojan hota he, unhen main bataanaa chahta hum ki jo IOC he vah IOA ko tikat or paas dete hai
 Question: Whenever cricketers go out, their family is with them


 Staying with family increases the morale of the players
 
 
 maakan : bilkul manobal badhata he, lekin landan main logon ko tehraane ke liye jo International Olympic Council ke maapdand hai, olympic village main tehraane kii jo capacity he, utane hi logon ko ham bhej paaenge
 This quota is decided according to the proportion of our players who have qualified
 is baar hamaare 81 players ne qualifi kiya he, to usee ke anupaat main ham-duusare logon ko unke saath bhej sakate hai
 We have to decide whether to send the players 'families or the players' coaches to the doctor or physio
 agar team ke saath khilaadiyon ke coach doctor yaa physio na jaaen or sirf parivaaravale jaaen, to khiladiyon kaa pradarshan behatar hoga kya
 
 
 Question: Whenever any big international games are held, the officials are more in the government delegation and less players and coaches
 
 
 maakan : is baar hamaara sabase bada khilaadiyon kaa delygation hoga or sabase choti adhikariyon kii team


pichhali baar beijing olympic main sarkari dailygation main 166 log gaye the, jabaki is baar sarkaar ke dailygation main sirf 10 log honge, jinamein 10 purv olympian shaamil hai
 This time our two government teams with 5–5 members will travel to London at different times
 tippaniyan Question: The controversy that took place about the preparation of the tennis team, the statement was made, because of which the atmosphere that should be created could not be created this time


 maakan : aapane sahi kaha


maine baar−baar kaha he ki khilaadiyon ko rashtrahit main sochakar khelnaa chahie
 When you represent India, the players should think about their country
 koi bhi bayaanbaji karne se pehle unhen is bare main sochna chahie
 Question: For the first time, the Government of India has spent money on the preparation of the Olympic Games in a planned manner
 medal jeetne kii khilaadiyon kii kshamta kaa koi akalan kiya gaya he? Ajay Maken: 56 players qualified for the 2008 Beijing Olympics and this time 81 players have qualified for the London Olympics
 jo bhi khilaadi qualifi karata he, vah apane aap main vishwa str kaa hota he
 This is a big achievement
 khilaadiyon ne is baar kaaphi mehnat kii he
 a lot of money has also been spent on them
 unhen behtareen coach or duusari suvidhaayen muhaiyaa karai gai hai
 As a result, so many players have not qualified for any Olympic game till date
 mujhe ummid he ki hamaara pradarshan acha hoga
 Question: We had three medals at the Beijing Games
 is baar kitne padak kii ummid he? Maken: Increasing the number of medals is not very easy, but this time the number of qualifying players has increased from 56 to 81
 jaahir si baat he ki hamaari parformens is baar acchhee honi chahie
 But it all depends on how our players perform at that crucial moment
 meri najar main hamaare shooter, boxr, teerandaaj, pahalwaan, medal prospects hai
 Question: My com number is a boxer
 
 
 maakan : haa meri com se ummid he
 Deepika is Kumari
 bandminton kii dubles team acchhee he
 Saina Nehwal is also doing well
 sawaal : sina nehwal kaa aapane zikr kiya


jo khilaadi landan olympic jane vaale hai, unke pariwaron ko khel dekhne ke liye tikat or paas nahin die gaye
 a lot of players are disappointed because of this
 
 
 maakan : dekhiye, saare paas bhartiya olympic sangh (IOA) ke paas aate hai
 Our 10-member official team will go to London this time with seven former Olympians
 is delygation ke liye bhi tikat hamen IOA se maangana pad rahaa he
 IOA will give us tickets, then we will go there
 aisa nahin he ki sarkaar ko tikat milti he
 Those who are unaware of how the Olympics are organized, i want to tell them that the IOC is the ticket and pass to the IOA
 sawaal : jab bhi cricketer baahar jate hai, unka parivaar unke saath hota he


parivaar saath rahane se manobal badhata he khilaadiyon kaa
 
 
 Maken: Absolutely boosts morale, but to accommodate people in London, which are the criteria of the International Olympic Council, the capacity to stay in the Olympic Village, we will be able to send as many people
 hamaare jitne khilaadiyon ne kwalifai kiya he, uske anupaat main hi ye kota tay hota he
 This time our 81 players have qualified, then we can send other people with them in proportion to the same
 hamen ye tay karnaa hoga ki ham khilaadiyon ke parivaaravaalon ko bhejein yaa phir khilaadiyon ke coach doctor yaa physio ko
 If the coaches of the players do not accompany the team to the doctor or physio and only the family members go, what will be the performance of the players? 
 
 sawaal : jab bhi kisi bade antarrashtriya khelon kaa aayojan hota he, to sarkari delygation main adhikari zyada hote hai or khilaadi or coach kam
 
 
 Maken: This time we will have the biggest players delegation and the smallest officials team


 Last time, 166 people went to the official delegation in Beijing Olympics, while this time the government delegation will have only 10 people, including 10 former Olympians
 is baar hamaari 5−5 sadasyon vaali do sarkari timen alag−alag samay par landan jaaengi
 The comments sawaal : tennis kii team taiyaar karne ko lekar jo vivaad hua, bayaanbaji hui isaki vajah se jo maahaul bananaa chahie vah nahin ban paaya is baar


 Maken: You are right


 i have repeatedly said that players should think and play in the national interest
 aap jab bharat kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai, to khilaadiyon ko apane desh ke bare main sochna chahie
 They should think about this before making any rhetoric
 ajay maakan : 2008 ke beijing olympic ke liye 56 khilaadiyon ne qualifi kiya tha or is baar 81 khilaadiyon ne landan olympic ke liye qualifi kiya he
 Whichever player qualifies is world class in itself
 yah bahut badi uplabdhi he
 The players have worked hard this time
 un par bahut paisa bhi kharch kiya gaya he
 They have been provided with excellent coaches and other facilities
 uskaa nateeja yah hua he ki aaj tak kisi olympic khel ke liye itane zyada khilaadiyon ne qualifi nahin kiya tha
 i hope we do well
 sawaal : beijing khelon main hamen teen padak mili the
 How many medals are expected this time? maakan : padakon kii sankhya badhanaa bahut aasaan nahin hota he, lekin is baar qualifi karne vaale khilaadiyon kii sankhya 56 se badhkar 81 ho gai he
 It is obvious that our performance should be good this time
 lekin yah sab is baat par nirbhar karegaa ki us mahatvapurn kshan main hamaare khilaadi kaisaa pradarshan karte hai
 In my view, we are shooter, boxer, archer, wrestler, medal prospect
 sawaal : meri com number ek boxr hai
 
 
 Maken: Yes, i do expect com
 deepika kumari he
 Bandminton's doubles team is good
 sina nehwal bhi acha pradarshan kar rahi he
 Question: You mentioned Saina Nehwal


 The players who are going to the London Olympics, their families were not given tickets and passes to watch the game
 is vajah se bahut saare khilaadi niraash hai
 
 
 Maken: See, all of them come to the Indian Olympic Association (IOA)
 hamaara jo 10-sadasyeey aadhikarik dal is baar landan jayega, usamen saat purv olympian honge
 We have to ask for tickets from IOA for this delegation as well
 IOA hamen tikat degi, to ham vahaan jaaenge
 It is not that the government gets a ticket
 jo anbhigya hai ki kis tarah olympic kaa aayojan hota he, unhen main bataanaa chahta hum ki jo IOC he vah IOA ko tikat or paas dete hai
 Question: Whenever cricketers go out, their family is with them


 Staying with family increases the morale of the players
 
 
 maakan : bilkul manobal badhata he, lekin landan main logon ko tehraane ke liye jo International Olympic Council ke maapdand hai, olympic village main tehraane kii jo capacity he, utane hi logon ko ham bhej paaenge
 This quota is decided according to the proportion of our players who have qualified
 is baar hamaare 81 players ne qualifi kiya he, to usee ke anupaat main ham-duusare logon ko unke saath bhej sakate hai
 We have to decide whether to send the players 'families or the players' coaches to the doctor or physio
 agar team ke saath khilaadiyon ke coach doctor yaa physio na jaaen or sirf parivaaravale jaaen, to khiladiyon kaa pradarshan behatar hoga kya
 
 
 Question: Whenever any big international games are held, the officials are more in the government delegation and less players and coaches
 
 
 maakan : is baar hamaara sabase bada khilaadiyon kaa delygation hoga or sabase choti adhikariyon kii team


pichhali baar beijing olympic main sarkari dailygation main 166 log gaye the, jabaki is baar sarkaar ke dailygation main sirf 10 log honge, jinamein 10 purv olympian shaamil hai
 This time our two government teams with 5–5 members will travel to London at different times
 tippaniyan Question: The controversy that took place about the preparation of the tennis team, the statement was made, because of which the atmosphere that should be created could not be created this time


 maakan : aapane sahi kaha


maine baar−baar kaha he ki khilaadiyon ko rashtrahit main sochakar khelnaa chahie
 When you represent India, the players should think about their country
 koi bhi bayaanbaji karne se pehle unhen is bare main sochna chahie
 Question: We had three medals at the Beijing Games
 is baar kitne padak kii ummid he? Maken: Increasing the number of medals is not very easy, but this time the number of qualifying players has increased from 56 to 81

 roj kii tarah aspataal main yah ek saamaanya din tha
 Then a girl named Piya came to my clinic with some feeling of restlessness and eagerness
 ghabrahat main vah apane hothon ko rah-rahakar chaba rahi thi
 He asked me directly, "can you make me talk to people like that?" ’’ main hairaani se uski taraf dekh hi rahaa tha ki usne saaf-saaf bataaya, ‘‘koi bhi mujhase baat nahin karata, sivaa meri naak ke bare main baat karne ke
 "piya's face was quite beautiful, but her nose was somewhat sharp and long, due to which the eyes of people would go straight to her nose
" usne apni naak kii rinoplasty karwaai, jiske baad uski shikaayat dur ho gai
 He thanked me wholeheartedly and said, "you changed my life
" ’’kishor yuvak-yuvatiyaan titliyon main tabdeel hone vaale caterpillar kii tarah hai
 Suddenly everyone has his own identity and is the center of attraction
 bataur plastic sarjan maine kareeb se dekha he ki koi vyakti apane rup-rang ko lekar kis had tak hin granthi kaa shikaar ho saktaa he
 This lowers his self-confidence and kills his self-esteem
 kishor umr ke ladke-ladakiyon ke bare main yah baat vishesh rup se sahi he
 Today's teens are more ambitious and conscious than before
 cosmetic surgery kii badhati maang is baat kaa saboot he
 We surveyed about 500 students from colleges in Delhi and reviewed their body image and their attitude towards cosmetic surgery
 surveykshan ke nattejey chaunkaane vaale the
 More than 60 percent of the respondents answered "yes" to four issues: 64 percent of the students were aware of some aspects of their appearance
 68 fisadi kaa maananaa tha ki unke rup-rang ne vipareet sex ke saath unke rishton ko kis tarah prabhavit kiya
 65 percent said that physical personality was essential for success in the job and 80 percent said that facial beauty is the most important in their personality
 kya aapane sochaa he ki cheharaa itnaa mahatv kyon rakhata he
 Actually it is a reflection of our personality
 duniya hamen chehre se jaanati he
 So it is not surprising that we all make every effort to give prominence to our faces
 hamaare survey ke mutabik aadhe se zyada kishor media dwaara tarif paane vaale kuch logon kii khubsuurati se prabhavit the or unke jaisaa banane kii chahat rakhte the
 The survey also found it interesting that teenagers considered cosmetic surgery as a good way to look beautiful
 kareeb 42 fisadi uttardaataaon ne ise behatar bataaya or 70 fisadi ne kaha ki agar logon ko unki cosmetic surgery ke bare main pataa chal gaya to unhen kisi tarah kii jhenp nahin hogi
 We cannot easily ignore these figures
 hamamen se adhikansh log ab bhi cosmetic surgery ko vyarth kii cheez maanate hai or uskaa upyog karne vaale logon ko ‘‘maansik rup se asthir’’ qaraar dete hai
 Many young people come to my clinic to have their nose made like Michael Jackson's
 haalanki aise log kam hi hote hai
 When we understand that cosmetic surgery cannot change their personality, they often agree and say that instead of imitating others, they should be made the way they look good

 mukherjee ne bataaya ki dilli pahunchane ke ek din baad vah durga puja ke liye kolkata ravaanaa ho jaaenge
 Describing Chidambaram as an important ally, Mukherjee said that he would look into all documents related to the Union Finance Ministry's comments and discuss with the Union Law Minister to know the legal implications of the remarks
 ullekhneey he ki washington se yahaan pahunchane ke baad mukherjee ne patrakaron se baatcheet karne se inkaar kar diya tha
 Mukherjee also stayed at the same hotel in New York where the Prime Minister is staying with his delegation
 pradhanmantri ne shanivaar ko 2ji maamle main chidambaram ke istife kii vipaksh kii maang ko khaarij kar diya

 Manmohan Singh said, "A lot of incidents are happening in the world
 vishwa aarthik mandi se jujh rahaa he
 He would like to make me aware in this regard
 " The Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana is one of the most ambitious schemes of the Prime Minister, but when it was investigated, it was found that the paperwork and office formalities were sabotaging it

 But deficiencies and frequent inspections in some centers
 
 
 job role alot hone main deree ke chalate unakon centre band karnaa padaa
 Showing his closed center of Buddha Vihar, Vinod says that about twenty to three million items are lying closed because they have no money to pay the rent
 yahi haal raju manachanda jaise centre sanchaalkon kaa he
 The center has not been able to start till now despite heavy investment of fifty lakhs due to repeated inspections due to office delays and minor errors

 Also, state governments have also been included in this
 sarkari susti ke chalate kai baar maheenon lag jate hai jisase ek acchhee yojana ko chalaane waalon main niraashaa he
 Under this scheme, the government is given 30 per cent of the amount to the Central Operators after the admission of the students, 50 per cent after the completion of the course and the remaining 20 per cent after the placement of the 70 per cent of the trend students
 neshnal skill devlepment karporation khud maan rahaa he ki 2016 se ab tak 94000 chaatro ko trend kiya ja chukaa he lekin naukari mili mahaj 51 fisadi ko yani 47000 ko
 However, the center operators are also telling this number more
 centre sanchaalak rajesh goyal bataate hai ki bazaar main mandi kii vajah se trend chaatro ko naukari dilaane main khaasi dikkat hoti he
 This is the reason why no center has received twenty percent amount till date, which should be met on the placement of 70 percent of the trend students
 udhar jin chaatro ne training kii he unhen yaa to bahut dur naukari kaa apher diya jaataa he yaa wo nai naukari kii aas main nae trade se course karne pradhanmantri kaushal vikaas centre main pahunch rahe hai

 5
 If Gehlot wanted to become the CM of the state, after losing in 2013 he would have become the state president himself, would have fought the battle, but why did he keep busy in Delhi politics and try to troll the state? 6

 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he) In the Lok Sabha elections, the SP-BSP alliance in Uttar Pradesh has not been a relative success
 in dalon kii 80 siton par jatigat golbandi kii koshish safal nahin ho saki
 Every equation of these two parties divided among castes proved to be a failure on the ground
 is tarah sapa-basapa gathbandhan ke jaateey sameekaran ke myth dhwast ho gaye
 Both parties failed to understand the changes happening in the state
 ve logon tak apni baat ko janata tak pahunchane main kaamyaab nahin ho sake
 All the arithmetic of this alliance collapsed in the backdrop of Dalit, Backward and Muslim votes
 gathbandhan main congress ko shaamil na karnaa bhi kuch hadatak nuksaandaayak gaya he
 The Congress nominees appeared to outnumber the SP BSP in some seats
 vah inke liye sachmuch votakatwa sabit hue hai
 But the battle in Uttar Pradesh was not easy for the BJP
 gorakhpur-phulpur or kairana main hue upachunaav ke baad uttar pradesh main bijepi ke paksh main maahaul bilkul nahin tha
 The arithmetic of the SP-BSP and RALD votes was completely heavy on the party and all the electoral experts were guessing that the BJP was extremely difficult with more than 15 to 20 seats
 ankaganit main bijepi puri tarah se kamjor thi or bijepi ke netaa bhi ek tarah se haar maan baithe the
 But at this time BJP President Amit Shah, who had guaranteed victory for the BJP, gave up completely and once again started working on the same formula which was used in the 2014 Lok Sabha and 2017 Assembly elections
 yah formula tha 60-40 kaa
 Uttar Pradesh has 40 percent voters including Yadavs, Muslims and Jatavs
 iske alaava baaki bachi jatiyon (isamen savarna bhi shaamil) ko mila den to 60 fisadi hoti he
 The BJP had to focus on these 60 percent voters and at the same time everyone had to reach maximum polling booths
 lekin bijepi ke saamne badi chunauti thi ki uske kor votaron main shaamil savarna is baar essi / asti sanshodhan act se naaraaz the or amit shah ko is baat kaa andaja ho gaya tha
 To reduce the anger of the upper castes, the Modi government announced the implementation of 10 percent reservation on economic grounds
 iske baad ram janmabhumi andolan se jude santon or aresas ke kaaryakartaaon ko savarnon ko samajhane kaa jimmaa diya gaya
 Many small conferences of non-jatav castes, whose percentage is very less in percentage but they have a good influence in almost every seat, were held
 in sabakaa prabhaav yah rahaa ki savarnon ke saath-saath ye jatiyaan bhi bijepi ke paale main ek baar phir aa gayi
 After this, PM Kisan Yojana also showed great work and more beneficiaries of this scheme belong to these castes
 haalanki gaanvon main jo log kheti se jude hai vah chutta gum rahe aawaara pashuon se kaaphi naaraaz the unki shikaayat thi ki yah jaanavar unki fasalon kaa nuksaan kar rahe hai
 But it seems that this complaint went away as soon as the amount of PM Kisan Fund reached 2 thousand in the account
 iske baad piem modi in jatiyon ko sambodhit karte hue hameshaa barabari kii baat karte the
 In this, the issue of national security also made a big impact and Operation Balakot also showed its impact
 iske alaava modi sarkaar ne un labhaarthiyon se bhi sidhe baat kerani shuru jinako beete paanch saalon main ghar, shauchalay, gas silendar or bijli kii suvidha mili he
 Apart from this, the Ayushman Bharat scheme was also vigorously promoted
 inamen se kuch yojanaon ko uttar pradesh vidhansabha chunaav ke pehle se hi vishesh nigaraanee main lagu karwaanaa shuru kar diya gaya tha
 The Prime Minister's Office was overseen by the CM Yogi Adityanath government
 in yojanaon ko lagu karwaane ke liye bijepi kii apni mashinari ne bhi jamkar kaam kiya or kaaryakartaaon ne iske labhaarthiyon se sidhe sampark kiya
 The BJP was able to send a message to its 60 per cent voters that PM Modi is the only leader who can do good to them
 iske alaava bijepi ke ranneetikaron ne uttar pradesh main 25 se zyada reliyon kaa plan banaaya
 Overall, the BJP managed to win 62 seats, defeating PM Modi's face, its cadre, better management of the government scheme, all equations on the basis of nationalism

 The question of sharing of Cauvery water provokes similar sentiments in Karnataka and political parties have been exploiting it for years for their benefit
 yah mudda karnataka or tamilnadu ke bich ek-duusare ko patkhni dene kaa khel ban gaya he
 The same happened this year
 donon rajyon ke liye 2016 pani kii ''tangi" kaa saal rahaa he, kyonki kaveri ke jalgrahan ilaake (karnataka ke kodagu jile) main barish kaa pani ausat se 33 fisadi kam hua
 By the end of August 2016, the total storage level of water stored in the Cauvery Basin (in KRS, Kabini, Harangi and Hemavati dams) was 115 TMC feet, as against an average of 216 TMC feet in general
 kaveri jal vivaad nipataara panchat ke faisle ke mutabik, jis varsh saamaanya barish ho, karnataka ko 193 tiemasi feet pani chhod dena chahie—10 tiemasi foot june main, 34 tiemasi foot july main, 50 tiemasi foot agast main, 40 tiemasi foot sitambar main or 22 tiemasi foot aktubar main
 When Karnataka did not release the required water in July and August, Tamil Nadu approached the Supreme Court against it
 court ne tamilnadu ke haq main faisla sunaaya (duusari baar) or karnataka ko 12,000 kusek pani 20 sitambar tak chhodie kaa nirdesh diya
 What happened then, on 12 September, the state was flooded with protests and violence
 bengaluru main police ke saath takaraav main do log maare gaye or khabaron ke mutabik, puure karnataka main 150 se zyada tamilnadu kii gadipoon main todfod or aagjanee kii gai
 Tamil-speaking businesses were targeted

 The Chief Minister then took stock of the security situation and curfew was imposed in 16 police station areas
 lekin tab tak der ho chuki thi
 a day later, Siddaramaiah took precautions and agreed to provide water to Tamil Nadu as per the Supreme Court order
 udhar tamilnadu main sattarudh eiediemke ne ise apni netaa ''ammaa" kii ek or jeet qaraar diya
 It is not hopeful that Tamil Nadu will be satisfied with the Supreme Court verdict

 s
 puttanaiya kehete hai, ''pani kaa yah vivaad adaalat main nahin suljhaayaa ja saktaa
 This can only happen through meaningful conversation
 donon rajyon ke netaa apane ahan ko tilanjali den or tangi ke varshon main pani ke bantwaare kaa koi formula nikaalen
 "farmers like him blame politicians in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu for the current situation
 isliye or bhi ki pichley nau varshon se tangi kaa koi formula nahin nikaala ja sakaa he
 The Cauvery Tribunal gave its final verdict on February 5, 2007, since then there has been no consensus as to how water will be distributed if the monsoon is poor
 tangi ke in varshon main vatal nagaraj or karnataka rakshana vedike ke sansthaapak narayan gauda sareekhe kannada netaaon ko kannada bhashaa or kisaanon ke apane priy muddon par kham thonkate hue saamne aane kaa mauka mil jaataa he
 "when Karnataka does not have enough water to meet its drinking water needs, why should we share Cauvery water with Tamil Nadu," says Nagaraja Doo
 ham kaveri ke liye ladenge
 
 
 Kaveri is from Karnataka
 "tangi ke varshon main dikkat isliye bhi hoti he kyonki panchat kaa aadesh is bare main puri tarah saaf nahin he—''tangi ke saal main jab kaveri basin main pani kam ho, to kerala, karnataka, tamilnadu or puduccheri ke bich aavantit hisse usee anupaat main kam ho jaaenge
 "it is left to the discretion of the Cauvery Supervisory Committee to assess the ground reality of the two states to determine the amount of water to be released for Tamil Nadu
 alabatta kaveri management board kam barish vaale varshon main uplabdh pani ke bantwaare ko lekar usee kism ke formule ke aadhaar par faisla kar saktaa tha, jaise desh ke duusare nadi management bordon ne apanaae hai
 But neither Karnataka nor Tamil Nadu tried to push for the formation of this board
 karnataka jarur kaveri management board ke gathan kii gunjaaish mahasoos karata he, par dikkat yah he ki sabhi rajyon ne panchat ke aakhri faisle ko maan liya he
 Siddaramaiah says, "we all want this issue to end
" 
 
 par rashtriya jal niti kahaan he? desh main aisi ek niti hoti to hamen itani bheeshan samasya kaa saamana nahin karnaa padataa
 "experts believe that the only way to move forward is to assess the ground realities during the stringent years
 donon rajyon ne panchat kaa aakhri faisla manjuur nahin kiya or supreme court gaye
 Karnataka's appeal is scheduled for hearing on 18 October
 siddharamaiya kehete hai, ''isamen dheron mudde shaamil hai
 We are looking for a long-term solution
 18 aktubar ko ham court main jamini hakeekat rakhenge
 When the definition of tangi formula is not fixed, how can this issue be resolved? ”no state is satisfied with the arbitration decision

 2ji spectrum ghotaalaa congress ke liye ji kaa janjaal ban gaya he
 The UPA government has been constantly on the target of opposition ever since the names of DMK ministers, the upa's ally in the scam, surfaced but after A
 Raja and Kanimozhi went to jail, the Congress thought the matter gave up
 lekin vitt mantralay ke ek note ne sara khel bigaadkar rakh diya
 It was written in the Finance Ministry's note that if the then Finance Minister p Chidambaram had wanted, the 2G spectrum allocation scam would not have happened
 vitt mantri pranav mukherjee ne bhi sweekaar kiya ki unke mantralai ne piemo ko aisa note bheja tha
 After that, differences between two senior ministers of the government, P
 Chidambaram and Pranab Mukherjee, and the infighting within the Congress came to the fore
 kya he vivaad?2ji spectrum maamle ko lekar vitt mantralay kii ore se 15 march 2011 ko ek note taiyaar kiya gaya tha
 It said that the then Finance Minister (now Home Minister) P
W
 chidambaram chaahate to 2ji spectrum kii nilaamee roak sakate the
 This note was sent to the Prime Minister's Office
 is maamle ke saamne aane ke baad se vipaksh chidambaram ke istife kii maang kar rahaa he
 Janata Party President Subramaniam Swamy has presented this note of the Finance Ministry in the Supreme Court as proof and demanded that if a Raja is guilty then Chidambaram is equally guilty
 vivaad ke baad se chidambaram ab tak 3 baar istipha dene kii peshkash kar chuke hai
 Why increased talk? The main reason for the infighting in the Congress in the 2G case is the finance ministry note which said that if Chidambaram had insisted, this scam would not have happened and the government exchequer would not have suffered so much
 chidambaram kaa kahana he ki unhen yah note kyon nahin dikhaaya gaya jabaki duusari ore pranab mukherjee apane rukh par kaayam hai
 On Wednesday, Mukherjee sent a second note to the PMO, clearly stating that after consulting the PMO and several ministries, the finance ministry had prepared the note in which Chidambaram's role in the 2G scam was pointed out
 kya hai halaat?2ji maamle main congress ke andar jari kalah ke bich maujuuda halaat ye hai ki pradhanmantri manmohan singh or congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi jaldi se jaldi is vivaad kaa samaadhaan chaahate hai
 In this connection, the round of meetings continues continuously
 mukherjee bhi chindbaram ko mahatvapurn sahyogi bataa chuke hai
 However, Chidambaram is very angry and has offered a resignation
 vipaksh kaa rukh2ji maamle par vipaksh grahamantri pi chidambaram ke istife kii lagaataar maang kar rahaa he
 However, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has defended Chidambaram, saying that the opposition is eager to hold elections soon, so it is trying to destabilize the government
 bijepi ne kaha he ki maamle main chidambaram utane hi doshi hai jitne e raja
 The BJP has even said that we do not need to topple the government, but the government will reach its end by its own actions

 Singh, a former Union minister and long-time Lalu's aide, said he had ideological differences with Lalu Prasad on many issues but would remain with him
 unhone kaha, ‘pichley loksabhaa chunaavon ke dauraan congress se gathbandhan todna lalu prasad kii sabase badi galati thi
 He did not give much details in this regard but he was anticipating the adverse impact of this decision in the Bihar assembly elections
 gauratlab he ki rajd or congress kaa 2000 se gathbandhan tha tathaa 2000 se 2005 ke bich donon gathbandhan sarkaar main shaamil rahe
 Along with this, the RJD was a major ally in the first UPA government
 lekin 2009 chunaavon ke purv donon dalon ke sambandhon main khatas aa gai or donon ne alag alag chunaav ladane kaa faisla kiya
 Many believe that both were harmed by this decision
 singh ne vidhansabha chunaavon main lojpa ko 75 siten dene ke faisle par bhi aapatti jataayi
 'LJP does not have qualified candidates and by giving it 75 seats, he (lalu) has strengthened the NDA position in many of them
 ’ unhone kaha ki isse rajd ke kai yogya ummidavaaron ko tikat nahin mila jisase party ko nuksaan ho saktaa he
 Singh, the party's vice-president and five-time MP from Vaishali seat, said, 'I have differences with Lalu on many issues
 ’ haalanki unhone spasht kaha‘‘ lekin mere vidrohi banane kaa koi kaaran nahin he
 'his remarks are of great importance as there was speculation that he may leave the party due to his relative Raghupati Singh not getting RJD ticket from Vaishali Assembly seat
 raghupati ab congress ke tikat par maidan main hai
 Singh said he was not unhappy with his relative not getting the ticket as he never insisted for his ticket
 lalu ke saath bane rahane kaa kaaran bataate hue singh ne kaha, ‘vah (lalu) saamaajik andolan kaa pratinidhitiv kar rahe hai or main is andolan ke prati katibaddh hum

 State Forest Minister Umang Singhar has written a letter of complaint to Congress President Sonia Gandhi accusing former Chief Minister Digvijay Singh of becoming an anti-incumbency and destabilizing the party's government in the state
 pradesh main party ke satta main aane ke baad se hi congress ke netaaon main naaraazgi chal rahi thi, lekin yah pehali baar he jab kisi mantri ne party ke ek varisht netaa ke khilaaf khulkar aawaaj uthaai he
 In the letter, Singhar has accused the former chief minister of providing a chance to the opposition by writing a letter on behalf of all ministers (except only his son Urban Administration Minister Jayawardhan Singh)
 singhar ke anusaar, digvijay singh ne mantriyon se, apni ore se bheje rajnatik anurodhon kii sthiti ke bare main jaankaree maangi thi
 Singhar told the media on September 1, "the only thing i can tell about Digvijay is that everyone knows who is running the government from behind the scenes
" to phir ve kyon mantriyon ko patr likh rahe hai?''3 sitambar ko singhar ne digvijay par sarkaar se 'blakemeling' or afasaron ke jariye nitiyaan prabhavit karne kaa aarope lagaaya
 This time he also took the name of Jayavardhan, he wants to wrap him up as well
 jayavardhan ko aksar pradesh congress kaa ubharta sitara qaraar diya jaataa he
 Observers believe that the purpose of making open allegations is to stop Digvijay Singh's interference in the government
 yah rahul gandhi ke adhyaksh pad chhodie ke baad badale rajnatik paridrishy kaa nateeja bhi he
 Singhar, a tribal MLA from Dhar district, is a nephew of the late Jamuna Devi
 jamuna devi 1990 ke dashak ke aakhri varshon main digvijay kii cabinet main upmukhyamantri rah chuki hai
 Digvijay Singh respected Jamuna Devi, popularly known as Buaji, but was not considered to be his camp
 2018 ke disambar main congress ke satta main vaapasi karne ke baad umang ko cabinet mantri banaaya gaya or van mantralay saunpa gaya
 He was considered close to Rahul Gandhi and not Kamal Nath, Digvijay or Jyotiraditya Scindia's favorite person for taking him into the cabinet
 teenon netaaon ne apni pasand ke kareeb aath-aath mantri bana liye the
 Digvijay and Singhar have also had disputes before
 apana naam jaahir na karne kii shart par ek mantri ne bataaya ki ''keval singhar nahin, rahul ke adhyaksh pad se istipha dene ke baad unka kareebi hone kaa daawa karne vaale sabhi mantri ab nayaa rajnatik godfadar khojane main lag gaye hai
 "singhar has been trying to increase his proximity with Chief Minister Kamal Nath for some time
 kamalnath bhi idhar cabinet kii har mahatvapurn samitiyon main singhar ko namankit kar rahe hai
 Digvijay and Kamal Nath have a fun relationship
 digvijay jab mukhyamantri the to dilli main alaakaman ke saath sambandh durust rakhane main unhen kamalnath sahyog karte the
 Now the roles of both have reversed and depend on the support of Digvijay in running the Kamal Nath government
 ve pratidwandviyon ko shikast dene main ek-duusare kaa saath dete rahe hai, pehle shukla bandhuon ko or ab jyatiraditya sindhiya ko
 The Digvijay camp feels that the purpose of openly opposing Singhar in this way is an attempt to create a rift between the two leaders
