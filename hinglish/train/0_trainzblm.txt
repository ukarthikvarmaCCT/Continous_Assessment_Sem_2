 @arunjaitley The government is constantly trying to stop the depreciation of the rupee, but experts feel that these steps will not have much effect
 sarkaar ne shuukravaar kai aisi yojanaon kaa elaan kiya jisase rupee ko majboot kiya ja sake
 These steps include a ban on non-essential imports
 haalanki visheshgy maanate hai ki isse videshi kosh aakarshith nahin ho balki alpakaalik karj badhane se iskaa dirghakaalik asar nakaaratmak ho saktaa he
 This apprehension has been expressed in HDFC Bank report
 report main kaha gaya, ‘is baat par gaur karne par ki jo kadam uthaaye gayi hai unase alpakaalik bahya rin badhegaa yaa iske tahat companiyon kaa jokhim badhegaa jiske nipatane ke liye unke paas bachaav kaa upaay nahin hoga
 In such circumstances, these measures will be considered negative

 ’bank ne kaha ki videshi niveshkon main masala band kii maang saamaanya taur par rupee kii sthirataa par nirbhar karti he

 isisi champions trophy 2017 kaa doosraa semifinal muqabla aaj birmingham ke edbeston stadium main bharat or bangladesh ke bich khelaa jayega
 India have the upper hand in this match, but Bangladesh's team is expert in the vicissitudes
 zyaadaatar badi timen is team ko kamjor aankati hai or iskaa khamiyaja bhugatti hai
 In terms of record, India is a strong contender for victory in this match
 cricket anischitataaon kaa khel he or aise main bangladesh ko jeet kaa daavedaar nahin maananaa galat hoga
 The Indian team would also like to avoid any kind of laxity against this neighboring rival
 bharatbharat kii team kaaphi santulit he
 Shikhar Dhawan and Rohit Sharma have given the team a great start every time in this Champions Trophy
 kohli ke alaava team ke paas number chaar par yuvaraj singh jaisaa ballebaaj he
 And Dhoni has a great finisher
 team india kii gendbaaji bhi sadhi hui rahi he
 a balanced mix of spinners with fast bowlers has played a key role in the team's victory
 south africa ke khilaaf shandaar pradarshan karne ke baad bhartiya team bhi aatmavishvaas se bhari he
 It will try to defeat Bangladesh by retaining its form
 ballebaaj form main hai, gendbaaj acha pradarshan kar rahe hai or kshetrarakshan bhi behtareen he

 Bangladesh will not make any mistake of considering them as weak, given the way Bangladesh won the league match by making a spectacular comeback against New Zealand
 is jeet se bangladesh ne semifinal main pahunchane ke liye apni raah taiyaar kii thi
 The Bangladesh team's main bowler is Mustajfizur Rahman, but he has not been able to show his 'magic' so far
 mustafijur ko apane verieshans ke kaaran shorter formet kaa behtareen gendbaaj mana jaataa he

 For the last two days, suddenly some politicians have started raising questions about the surgical operation
 isse mauka pakistan ko bhi mil gaya
 After this, the voice began to rise that the government should show the video to the world as a proof of surgical operation
 par kya ye sahi rahegaa? kya sarkaar ko sargical oparation ke sabooton ko aam karnaa chahie? kya isse PAK fouj ko mushkil nahin aegi? kya isse aage ke aise kisi sargical oparation main dushwari pesh nahin aegi?hamaare kuch netaa bol hindustan main rahe hai, par suna pakistan rahaa he
 Questions are being raised in India and Pakistan is giving the answer
 pakistani tivi or akhbaar hamaare hi nataaon ke bol kii surkhiyon or hedlins se bhare pade hai
 The smoldering question is: did India sneak across the loc, the Line of Control, last week, into the enemy's camp? Pakistan has been calling it false since day one
 magar ab khud hamaare apane kuch netaaon ke sargical oparation par sawaal uthaae jane ke baad maamla or garm ho gaya he
 Even after this dispute, the Indian Army itself had to say that the government can shut the mouth of such people by issuing video of evidence of surgical operation
 magar saath hi sena kaa ye bhi kahana tha ki saboot jari karne yaa naa jari karne kaa faisla puri tarah sarkaar kaa he
 Now the question in such a situation is that should the government bow down to all-round political pressure and release the video of the surgical operation? Would it be okay to do this? Will this not be dangerous for the Army going forward? According to sources, a high-level meeting was held in New Delhi after the Army's statement of leaving the decision on the government to release the video related to the surgical operation
 us meeting main kuch mantri saboot aam karne ke paksh main the, to enese samet baaki iske virodh main
 Ultimately, this decision was left to Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 sutron ke mutabik narendra modi enese yani rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar ke faisle se sahamat the ki philhal sirf raajnneetik dabaav main aakar video nahin jari kiya janaa chahie
 If sources are to be believed, the NSA had revealed seven major dangers of releasing videos related to the surgical operation
 wo khatre ye hai:1
 The enemy will be informed of the weapons used during the operation
 2
 Methods of operation will be seen by the enemy
 3
 Pak army will know the way of entry and exit
 4
 As soon as the pattern of operation is common, it will be difficult to prepare for the next surgical strike
 5
 The pressure of revenge on the Pak Army will increase
 6
 In a way, it will be the confession of the Indian Army in case of crossing the loc and violating the ceasefire
 7
 The release of evidence under pressure will create a false tradition for the government in the future
 sutron ke mutabik sena ne sarkaar ko kareeb dedh ghante kaa oparation kaa vijual saunp diya he
 It is being claimed that the surgical operation was shot with the help of commandos' helmets, night vision cameras and drone cameras
 yani ab aakhri faisla pradhanmantri narendra modi ko lenaa he
 But given the tough stance of the NSA, at the moment there is little hope that the video of the surgical operation will be revealed
 aisa nahin he ki bharat ne 26 sitambar ko elosi main ghus kar jo sargical oparation kiya, wo bharat kaa is tarah kaa koi pehla sargical oparation tha
 Even before this such surgical operations have been done on LOC

 asp Harithra Sriharan, daughter of Nalini, convicted for the murder of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, has requested Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi to forgive her mother Nalini
 enditivi se khaas baatcheet main nalini kii beti ne kaha ki vah rahul gandhi kaa dard samaj sakati he, lekin uske mata−pita ne pehle hi kaaphi sajaa bhugat lee he or ab vah maafee kii hakdaar he
 He said that despite the survival of his parents, he has suffered the same pain Rahul Gandhi has suffered after his father's death
 gauratlab he ki rahul gandhi ne tamilnadu sarkaar ke us faisle par sawaal uthaae hai, jisamen jayalalita sarkaar ne rajeev gandhi ke hatyaron kii rihaai kaa faisla kiya he
 Rahul Gandhi said that what will happen to the common people when the Prime Minister of the country cannot get justice
 nalini kii beti ne tamilnadu kii mukhyamantri jayalalita or congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi kii tarif karte hue kaha ki vah sonia gandhi ko kabhi nahin bhul sakati
 Emperor of Pataliputra Pagarewani Prakashan, New Delhi-2, Price: 695 Rs
 reverse ejineeringeh pagareshrad pagaare isse pehle gulaara begum, gandharvasen, or begum jainaabaadi jaise aitihaasik upanyaas likhakar is vidha main apni pahchaan bana chuke hai
 But the Empress of this latest macro novel Pataliputra differs in that through it the author has articulated the facts, characters and events of the past about which history is silent
 apni rachana prakriya ke bare main bhoomika likhte hue pagaare kehete hai, ''aitihaasik upanyaas aitihaasik satyon-tathyon or saahitiyik kalpana ke yatharth kaa samanvay he-simaaon or sambhaavnaaon main banta hua
 The material available in history has its limitations
 aap unase chhedchhad nahin kar sakate
 Doing that would be an injustice to history
 atah itihaas or sahitya kaa santulit samanvay aitihaasik upanyaas kii pratham or antim shart he
 
 
 This novel focuses on the Empress Dharma, the mother of the Brahmin daughter Ashoka, who was one of the sixteen Pataranis of Bindusara, the emperor of Pataliputra
 par is bahaane vividh prasangon, vivaadon or duusare charitron ke aise anek dwipon kaa nirmaan saamne aayaa he jo ateet ke us kaal khand kaa ang hote hue bhi samayik rajnatik, saamaajik or maanviya visangatiyon ko bakhubi ubharkar saakaar kar dete hai
 The description of the terminology and the atmosphere is so impressive that the proof of the author's studios and sharp eyes are established unintentionally
 par yah lekhak ke is daawey ke viruddh jaataa he ki rachana samraji dharma par hi kendrit he kyonki isamen stri shoshan, shashaktikaran, bhrashtachar, tiria charittar, dalit vimarsh, puunji, kootneeti or vyavasthaagat shoshan jaise aaj ke samakaleen prasang bhi tivrata se apni upasthiti darj karaate hue prathit hote hai
 Also, there are many characters like Chandragupta, Mahamatya Chanakya, Ashoka, Chitralekha, Mahamatya Khalataka, Jainacharya Bhadraba ', Bindusara, Rishipraver Pingalvatsa, Dalit Hiranyak, Subandhu, Ganika Kusumita, whose character is manifested in this work and is very similar to Dharma
 is also
 phir bhi dharma ke prati lekhak kaa apana moh he
 The reasons given by the author against this in the background are full of interesting narrative in itself
 pagaare likhte hai, ''ham bhartiya janm kundali main bahut vishwaas karte hai
 To know more about the little known Dharma in history, i made his horoscope
 
 
 ''is tarah kaa 'reverse ejineering' vaala prayog nihsandeh hi upanyaas vidha main nayaa he
 The author has perhaps ventured to a more shocking account, detailing another personal incident - canceling "pataliputra's Empress" by writing 80 pages three times before being finalized
 
 
 laga nahin likh paaungaa
 
 likhnaa band kar diya
 Then the miracle happened
 ek sanjh ek atyant rupasi milane ai or boli ki aap dharma kii kahani likhte kyon nahin? lekhak ne apni vivashtaa jataai to vah boli, 'jab aap alpagyaat aitihaasik paatro gulaara begum or begum jainaabaadi par pramanik saamagree ke abhaav ke baad bhi puraskrit upanyaas likh sakate hai to dharma par kyon nahin?
 
 
 Who are you who advocate Dharma? Dharma itself
 
 
 vati, abhaagi dharma, jiske saath itihaaskaaron ne nyaay nahin kiya
 
 
 Yes, our son Ashok definitely made great
 
 
 aap hamaare aradhy devadhidev mahadev kaa samaran kar likhen, upanyaas puraa hoga
 When the author is seriously entrenched in his composition, it makes no sense to doubt or not to doubt the authenticity of such imaginary experiences, although the claim seems interesting and natural
 lekhak kii yah nijee prerana bhi ullekhneey he ki ve malwa main nimad kii nagari mahishmati (maheshwar) se hai, jo ek puraatan nagari he, ujjain ke sameep
 Before being emperor, Ashoka was the vice-king of Ujjayini
 ujjain teen hajaar varsh se bhi adhik pracheen nagar he
 To repay the debt of the motherland, the author has given an exciting extension to the so-called Deshkaal by imagining characters like Sangeetacharya Visakhadatta Falguni and Vaishnavi
 kul milakar lekhak kii apni nijee athwa academik prerana jo bhi rahi ho, par antat hindi sahitya ko ek vishaal anyatam aitihaasik aupnyasik kriti kii jo uplabdhi patliputra kii samraji ke rup main hui he, usase inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa

 The Congress has decided to hold a conference of Chief Ministers of Congress-ruled states on June 9 as a clear step to target the Narendra Modi government's stand towards states ruled by non-bjp parties
 congress sanchaar vibhaag ke adhyaksh randeep surajevaala ne kaha ki party adhyaksh sonia gandhi or upaadhyaaksh rahul gandhi eisisi (akhil bhartiya congress samiti) mukhyalay main hone vaali is baithak main maujuud honge
 This will be the first such conference after the Congress lost power at the Center in May last year
 surajevaala ne kaha ki sammelan kaa agenda taiyaar kiya ja rahaa he
 The Congress is currently in power in nine states - Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, Assam, Mizoram, Manipur, Karnataka, Kerala, Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh
 saal 1998 se congress kii bagdor sambhaal raheen sonia ne congress ke centre main vipaksh main hone ke dauraan party mukhyamantriyon kaa is tarah kaa sammelan yojit karne kaa chalan shuru kiya tha
 The Congress meeting is likely to be used to intensify the attack on the Modi government on issues related to the states
 tippaniyan The Congress President has already attacked the Center and the Prime Minister in Parliament accusing them of "obstinate arrogance"
 kuch samay pehle unhone vivaadit bhoomi adhigrahan vidheyak kaa virodh karte hue vipaksh ke 14 netaaon ke saath raashtrapati bhawan kii ore march kiya tha
 Congress Communications Department President Randeep Surjewala said that party president Sonia Gandhi and Vice President Rahul Gandhi will be present at this meeting to be held at AICC (all India Congress Committee) headquarters
 pichley saal may main congress ke centre kii satta ganvaane ke baad yah is tarah kaa pehla sammelan hoga
 Surjewala said that the agenda of the conference is being prepared

 Pakistan's military on Wednesday rejected India's claim that Pak troops attacked a Indian patrol and killed two soldiers
 tippaniyan He claimed to have confirmed the ground and found that nothing of the sort had happened
 pakistani paksh ne yah baat donon pakshon ke sainya abhiyaan mahanideshkon (dijiemo) ke bich telephone par baatcheet ke dauraan kahi
 a Pakistani Army official, on condition of anonymity, said that Pakistan's DGMO Major General Ashfaq Nadeem held talks with his Indian counterpart Vinod Bhatia on the hotline and Indian Army's allegations of killing an Indian soldier by Pakistani troops crossing the Line of Control Rejected
 sainya adhikari ne kaha, bhartiya adhikariyon ko suchit kiya gaya he ki pakistan ne jamini pushti kii, jaanch kii or paaya ki is tarah kaa kuch bhi nahin hua, jaisaa ki bharat ne aarope lagaaya he

 Two minor girls, who were living in a private hostel in Pollachi town near Coimbatore in Tamil Nadu, were allegedly abducted and gangraped by two men
 police ne bataaya ki yah ghatana madhyaraatri ke baad us samay hui, jab aaropee is chatravaas main aae or pani maanga
 When two girls, aged 10 and 11, went to give them water, these people grabbed them and pulled them
 unhone bataaya ki is ghatana ke pratyakshdarshi ek ladke ne jab is par aapatti jataai, to aropiyon ne uski pitayee kar di
 They later forcibly took the girls to a nearby compound and raped them
 is ladke ne isi bich anya chaatro ko satark kiya or uske baad warden ko soochna di gai
 The police were later told about this
 police ne maukey par pahunchane par paaya ki ladkiyaan buree tarah ghayal thim or unke sharir se khun bah rahaa tha
 Police said the girls have been admitted to the government hospital in Pollachi
 sahasaa hi ek lahar paidaa ho gai he, jiskaa naam he rahul gandhi
 Congressional historians would record that during the merciless summer of 2009, this heir of the Gandhi family finally came out of the safe shadow of his mother, expressing his views — and that of the party as well
 pichley paanch saalon se to yah ek hichkichaate yuvaraj kaa kissa tha, jo vansh parampara kii maang or raajnneeti kii chunautiyon ke bich fansaa tha
 Brand Rahul was introduced to Nafasat several times, starting two years ago by making him the General Secretary of the party
 yaa tab jab ve pichley vidhansabha chunaavon ke aakhri daur main party ke star prachaarak banakar ubhare, yaa tab jab pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne unhen cabinet main mantri pad kii peshkash kii or unhone ise vinamratapurvak thukraa diya
 Every time young Gandhi could not take advantage of the opportunity by saying his inexperience
 unka yahi tark hota tha ki main-abhi-prashikshu-hum-meraa-samay-abhi-nahin aayaa he
 In a period when a man with a total of four years of public life experience and recently became a senator can become the President of the United States, the logic of inexperience exposes self-worth
 lekin ye sab kal kii baaten thim, aaj ve ek hamalavar kii aakraamakata, niti nirmaataa kii gambhirtha or ek aise netaa ke dabadabe kaa pradarshan kar rahe hai jise bakhubi pataa he ki party or betaab congressiyon ke man main uski jagah kya he
 With folded arms in the kurtas, they impatiently put their glasses on their foreheads and walk towards the villages with a program that is more than just a general secretary's program
 chaahe vah doordaraj ke gaanv kaa koi khule badan vaala garib shaks ho yaa conference haul main media, amethi ke 38 varshiya saansad bharat kii sabase puraani party main sabase adhik suni jane vaali aawaaj ban gaye hai
 So can we say that Rahul Gandhi's phase has really started? When the party's policies will not be discussed by the so-called core group behind closed doors of 10 Janpath? Rather, it will be announced loudly and on the spot or in a press conference being broadcast on television several times
 palak jhapakate hi bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar or tedepa pramukh chandrababu naidu jaise pratidwandvi unki prashansa ke paatr ban jate hai
 Even the Leftists, who tried their best to topple the Manmohan Singh government on the nuclear deal with the US, are no longer untouchables for them
 unka kahana tha, ''vamapanthiyon main or hamamen bahut kuch samanta he
 
 
 i am confident that the Left will support the Manmohan Singh-led government
 '' congressi abhi isaki kiafiyat talash hi rahe the ki nitish, naidu tathaa bhakpa netaa e
 B
 vardhan ne unki najdiki badhaane kii peshkash ko jhatak diya
 After this uproar, no one remembers that Rahul had also said that the Congress would not bow to the question of making Manmohan Singh the Prime Minister in the same way as he had not bowed to the nuclear deal
 media prakoshth ke adhyaksh virappa moili ne thodi chintaa ke saath kaha, ''ve ek paripakv netaa hai
 If your opponent is doing a good job, what is the harm in praising him? ”it is easy to understand why the team of Congress spokespersons looked so uncomfortable in the television studio that evening
 ye vahi rahul the jinhone kuch hi din pehle prachaar abhiyaan ke dauraan kolkata main vahaan ke 'jivashmon' par prahaar kiye the
 They were furious then, "communists in Bengal have been imprisoned in theoretical circles
 vah bhi ek puraani pad chuki vichaardhaara main, jo har jagah naakaamayaab rahi he
 Last year i went to China and the Chinese communists asked me what kind of communism is going on in Bengal? Why don't those people change? ”any sensible person would ask this question
 unki maa ne bhi rajya kaa daura karte hue communiston ko nahin bakhsha
 He had said, "the state government will have to answer why they have not done anything for the poor?" For a while, the Prime Minister too had become quite courageous against the Left
 phir ek din mahila patrakaron ke bich unhone apane swar badal die, ''vampanthi sahyogiyon ke liye mere man main bahut aadar or sammaan he
 As i have said over and over again, i am very sorry to miss them
 jahaan tak bhavishya kaa sawaal he to uske bare main koun kya kah saktaa he? kabhi ham pul tak pahunch gaye to use ham paar kar lenge
 "the party's immediate choice, Manmohan Singh, and Rahul's inevitable choice for the future, is perhaps to believe that they are reaching there (ie in power) and that they need the support of the old ideology to bridge the distance
" yaa phir kahin aisa to nahin he ki rahul hi sandesh ban gaye hai? aisa sandesh jo party kii maanak nitiyon ko dhata bataata he
 Or that they themselves have become a party? Suddenly he seems to have realized the uniqueness of his surname
 ve ek vyakti vaala sanghathan ban gaye hai jo apana agenda khud taiyaar kar rahaa he or use apni marji se badal rahaa he
 Since he is the indispensable future leader, he does not need to follow the party, but the party will have to change accordingly
 chetana par aadhaarit unki raajnneeti ne party ko bhramit hi kiya he or unke dushmano ko stambhit kar diya he
 Of course this has made them more difficult to understand
 nishchit rup se ve ek alag kism kii raajnneeti kar rahe hai or party ke varisht netaa ise samaj nahin rahe
 Although most Congress leaders are not involved in the decision-making process, they are well aware of the endless rounds of debate between the Congress President and his close group before reaching a decision
 iske vipareet rahul kaa tarika ekadam alag he
 They are happy with the politics of Ekla Chalo Re and Manmarji attack
 is kism kii raajnneeti ne party ke mitra or shatru, donon ko uljhan main daal diya he
 Allies like RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav, ljp's Ram Vilas Paswan and Trinamool Congress's Mamata Banerjee were angered by the childish attempt to replace their regional rivals
 paswan jaananaa chaahate the ki yadi nitish kumaar itnaa acha kaam kar rahe hai to rahul unke khilaaf ummidavaar kyon utaar rahe hai? tunakmizaaj banerjee ne is harakat ko 'matlab saadho or darkinar karo' kaa ek or udhaaharan bataaya, jiske liye congress kukhyat ho gai he
 Questioning the timing of Rahul's remarks, Parth Chatterjee of the Trinamool said that these remarks have come at a time when two phases of elections are yet to be held in West Bengal
 unka kahana tha, ''un jaise netaa se aisi gaiyr-jimmedaar tippaniyon kii apeksha nahin kii ja sakati
 It is also strange that these comments are coming at a time when elections have been held in the constituencies where the Congress fielded candidates
 '' yahaan tak ki rakanpa netaa sharad pavaar bhi rahul ke kataaksh se khush nahin the
 Asked if he would support Pawar for the post of Prime Minister? Rahul's answer was that of course we will give if the NCP emerges as the single largest party
 chunaav ke baad saathi banane ke lihaaj se aise kataaksh rajnatik drushti se to thik nahin kahe ja sakate
 But a Congress general secretary says that Rahul may have a strategy in this craze
 unhen yah maa-bete dwaara sooyeeboojh se taiyaar yojana kaa hissaa lagata he, aaveg yaa aavesh main diya gaya bayaan nahin
 He explains, "our assessment is that Lalu and Paswan will not win as many seats in Bihar as they won in the last election
" donon apane-apane nirvachan kshetra main haar sakate hai
 In Andhra Pradesh too, the situation is not very good for the Congress
 yah sab dekhte to nae saajheedaaron ko rijhaanaa hi samajhadaari he
 "so Rahul's statements were political opportunism or sound thoughtlessly thought out, the confusion that followed then made it clear that this was not a unanimous strategy of the party
" or aisa bhi nahin he ki sonia gandhi ne bete ko party kii bagdor puri tarah saunp hi di he
 This is just the first phase of assuming the party leadership, which was started by Sonia in the last round of the assembly elections, when Sonia backed down and allowed Rahul to become the party's star campaigner
 ab unke saarvajanik vyaktitv main ek or aayam jud gaya he
 That is the decision making
 rahul ne hameshaa hi party kii netritv prakriya main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai he
 But before now, when he was asked something on matters other than the Youth Congress (he is the general secretary in charge of youth organizations), he would stop the questions, "ask the Congress President
" '' ab badlaav yah aayaa he ki rahul ne apane kaaryakshetra se pare bhi faisle karne shuru kar die hai
 Rahul, the youngest of 9 general secretaries, no longer hesitates to take decisions on issues beyond the youth cell
 party netritv ne hameshaa hi unke har shabd par gambhirtha se dhyaan diya he
 It was his decision that the Congress should not contest the Lok Sabha elections under the UPA umbrella
 unhen yah kehane kaa shauk he ki ve van-de match nahin khel rahe hai, balki lambii pari khilne aae hai
 They need to build the organization from the ground level, even if the Congress loses in these elections
 isse baukhalaaye lalu ne vyangy se kaha ki shesh sab netaa chunaav lard rahe hai lekin yah adarshavaadi yuva congress kaa nirmaan kar rahaa he
 It was Rahul who allowed party general secretary Digvijay Singh to hinder his alliance with the SP
 haal hi main media ke saath ek samvaad main unhone kaha, ''uttar pradesh or bihar hamaari takat ke centre hua karte
 And this is where our mass base has reduced considerably
 '' iske saath hi unhone sawaal uthaaya, ''hamane lalu or paswan ko choda yaa unhone hamen choda?'' takneekee taur par ve sahi ho sakate hai: unke sahyogiyon ne hi unka saath chhod diya
 But the Congress's tendency to dominate forced him to do this
 iske alaava sanghathanaatmak punargathan ko dhyaan main rakhte hue rahul ne naadaani bharaa suzav de daalaa ki 30 fisadi tikat yuvaaon ko die jane chahie
 However, he soon rectified it and confessed in front of his colleagues that it would be good to field the youth in the first assembly elections
 baad main phir yah kaha ki loksabhaa chunaav kii na jeetne vaali siton par yuvaaon ko utaarna thik rahegaa
 As a result, Krishna Bire Gowda, a very unhappy young leader and close to Rahul, was fielded against BJP veteran Anant Kumar in South Bangalore
 iske baavjood, party samskruti main badlaav darshaate shabdon kii rahul ke paas kami nahin he
 Even though he is the most distinguished heir to this party's legacy, he also wants to be an advocate of the party's internal democracy
 ve kehete hai, ''sirf isliye ki main ek vyavastha kii upaj hum, iskaa yah arth nahin ki main ise badal nahin saktaa
 "together we also add that" This also makes me in a position to do some special work
 jis vyavastha kii main upaj hum, use badalane ko apana kartavya or sammaan bhi samajhataa hum
 "despite this, there is no evidence of this blueprint at the ground level
 jin yuva nae chehron ko tikat mila, unamem adhiktar sthaneey sthapit raajnneetik pariwaron ke chiraag hi the
 Take the case of Punjab, where eight new faces were fielded
 unamem se teen to pratishthit pariwaron se hi theah captain amarinder singh ke putr runninder, beant singh ke pote ravanit singh bittu or punjab ke purv mantri sardul singh ke putr sukhwinder singh danni
 He is proud that the election process has reached the Youth Congress and Punjab has become the ideal state to become the first state in this matter
 phir bhi jab ve punjab ko ek adarsh ke rup main pesh karte hai to yah bhi vidambnaa hi he ki loktantr ke saath is prayog main yadi koi vijayi hokar ubharenge to ve honge bittu kandhaa jhatakate hue ve kehete hai, ''ummid kii jaati he ki loktantr bas ek batan dabaane se aa jayega
 You have to start somewhere
 '' lekin unhen khud bhi galat batan dabaane kii aadat he
 Like his mother, his dream for India is also a Nehruvian model of socialism
 ve desh main samaae do bharat ke bich kii duuri paatna chaahate hai
 They agree with the Left that the distribution of wealth should reach the poor
 lekin communiston ke vipareet, ve korporate india ke nirmaan kii jarurat ko bhi samajhate hai
 Its M
 In Development Economy
 phil kii degree kaa prayog karte hue ve kehete hai, ''vikaas or vitaran main sambandh he, jisaki vampanthi upeksha karte hai
 The Left supported us on the employment guarantee scheme, where did the money come from? After all, it was not dropping from the sky but was a byproduct of 8 percent GDP growth
 '' ve dalit or kabyli gharon main raat bitaate hai, jiskaa unke rajnatik pratidwandvi or media uphaas bhi udaate hai
 But he was not discouraged from following the voluntary decision to search for another India
 iske baavjood badlaav laane vaala bada vichaar abhi gaayab he
 If the changes that the Congress wants are the same, or the India that the party wants to market after Manmohan Singh, it is the same, then the Congress will have to present its mind and mind more clearly
 ve ateet se bahut alag raah nahin pakad raheh ve congress kii vanshavaad ke aage ghutane techne kii bhayaavah parampara ko apane hit ke liye istemaal karte hai
 His performance as an MP or as a Youth Congress leader is disappointing
 kahin bhi ve desh ko vah aashwasti nahin de paae ki ve hi vah badlaav hai jiskaa bharat besabri se intjaar kar rahaa tha
 Some contradictory things about potential allies do not symbolize the denial of ongoing politics
 ve ab bhi vanshavaad kii raajnneeti ke dulaare putr hai, jo apni aazaadee kaa anand uthaa rahe hai or is ehsaas kaa bhi ki ve vahi hai, jo desh chahta he
 Unlike his voters, he does not have to worry about his employment guarantee rule
 jis ghadi ve paidaa hue, unke rojgaar kii guarantee ho gai thi
 If there are so many privileges associated with the Gandhi surname, then we also have the right to know whether they deserve it too
 -saath main beuro reportensaabhaar: india today The Senate of Pakistan will discuss the disputed provision of the landmark Hindu Marriage Bill, which provides for the severance of marriage in the event of one of the spouses adopting another religion
 haal main ise sarvasammati se paarit kiya gaya tha
 The Law and Justice Affairs Committee of the National Assembly approved the draft law on Hindu marriage last week, paving the way for the registration of this religiously minority section of Pakistan after decades of delay
 kanoon evam nyaay maamalon kii sthaayee samiti kii pramukh seenetter nasrin jaleel ne is maamle main is saptaah samiti kii ek baithak bulaai he
 Clause 12 (three) of the Hindu Marriage Bill states that if any of the husband and wife adopt any other religion, the marriage relationship will be severed
 nasrin ne kaha ki kuch ne iskaa virodh kiya he jabaki kuch ne samarthan
 There is a need for consensus among the committee members
 ‘don’ akhbaar ne unke hawaale se kaha, ‘‘agar upbandh ko hataane par aamasahmati banati he to samiti apni siforishein neshnal assembly ke spikar ko bhejegi
 On the other hand, Maulana Mohammad Khan Sheerani, a member of the JUI-F in the Standing Committee of the National Assembly, seriously opposed the removal of the clause
 tippaniyan Shugufta Jumani of PPP and Ali Mohammed of Pakistan tehreek-e-insaf said that if one of the spouses adopts Islam then the marriage relationship should end

 Input: IANS madhya pradesh ke badnaam vyavsaayik pariksha mandal (vyapam) ghotaale kii jaanch kendriya jaanch beuro (sibiai) ke haath main aane ke baad sabhi isaki nishpaksh or tej jaanch kii ummid jataa rahe hai
 The Special Task Force (STF), probing under the supervision of the Special Investigation Team (SIT) appointed by the Madhya Pradesh High Court, has so far investigated the game of fixing in government medical colleges and government jobs
 iske alaava nijee collejon kii management cote kii siton ko bechney ke khel yani dimet ghotaale kii jaanch bhi shuru ho gai he
 But an investigation by India Today has revealed that between 2009 and 2013, STF did not show much interest in investigating the case of selling 721 seats of government quota in private colleges
 in siton par dhaandhlee kii pushti madhya pradesh “pravesh evam shulk niamak samiti (eeffarsi) ne kii thi or apellette athurity ne 21 may, 2015 ke apane aadesh main eeffarsi kii jaanch ko sahi maanakar aage jaanch karne ke liye kaha he
 No admission has been canceled nor arrests have been made so far regarding this part of the Vyapam scam
 is tarah estf ne vyapam ghotaale ke jitne hisse kii jaanch kii, utana hi hissaa thande baste main rakh choda he, jisaki paraten ab sibiai ko ughaddai hongi
 The challenge of the top investigative agency is even greater because the government has so far been seen as helping private colleges
 madhya pradesh ke chah nijee collejon&bhopal kaa chiraayu medical college evam hospital, piples medical college and research centre or alen medical college and research centre, ujjain kaa aar
 D
 gardi medical college, indore kaa shri aravindo institute of medical sciensej or indects medical college hospital and research centre ne apellette athurity main eeffarsi ke aadesh ko chunauti di thi
 During the investigation, it was confirmed that the last date of admission in private colleges between 2009 and 2013 i
e
 on September 30, students who were admitted through PMT on a large scale, had their names cut off and on the same day, private colleges on their behalf got new seats
 Used to enter the students
 niyam ke mutabik, in siton par piemti kii merit vaale chaatro ko daakhile kaa mauka milanaa chahie tha, lekin college prabandhan ne is niyam ko taak par rakh manamaane admician kiye
 The investigation also revealed that the colleges deliberately adopted such an opaque process so that deserving students do not come for counseling
 is ghotaale ke bare main chaunkaane vaali baat yah he ki jahaan piemti main dhaandhlee ke jariye admician paae jane par vyapam ghotaale main medical collejon ke 1,000 se zyada pravesh radd kar die gaye or anuchit laabh paane vaale chaatro, yahaan tak ki abhibhavakon ke khilaaf mukademe darj kiye gaye, vahiin nijee collejon ke manamaane daakhilon ke maamle main eeffarsi ne sirf jurmaane kii sifarish kii he
 And private colleges are in the process of ending this fine too
 721 siton ke ganit ko samajhaate hue vyapam ke vishlablower dow
 Anand Rai explains, “in fact, these seats are selected through counseling to those students who appear in the exam as a solver of another student
 ye pariksha main baithkar duusare chaatr ko nakal karakar paas karaate hai or khud bhi paas ho jate hai
 But since these students do not have to study, these people vacate the seats on the last date of admission i
e
 September 30 at the behest of the college management and later the college management gets these seats from 35 to 50 lakhs
 tak main bech detaa he
 "the question arises that what was the attitude of the Madhya Pradesh government in this whole matter? The answer comes in September 2014, when the SIT was formed to investigate the Vyapam scam and former Education Minister Laxmikant Sharma had gone to jail
 embibies or bidies daakhilon kii niyamavali ko sakht banaaya gaya or gadabadi paae jane par college ke pramukh yaa praachaarya ke khilaaf exiar darj karaane kaa praavdhaan kiya gaya
 But on the day of the council's commencement on 6 September 2014, Medical Education Minister Narottam Mishra removed the fir's provision and replaced it with the word "strict statutory action"
 yah jaankaree 9 janvari, 2015 ko anand raay kii artiai arji ke jawaab main di gai
 Rai claims that during this time he was also pressured to withdraw the RTI application
 madhya pradesh hycourt ke vakil nikhil tiwari bataate hai, “exiar kaa praavdhaan hataakar sarkaar ne nijee collejon ke kartadhartaon ko pravesh main dhaandhlee main giraftaar se bachaane kaa rasta khol diya
 This is a very serious matter
 ”yah iklauta mauka nahin he jab narottam mishra nijee collejon ke saath khadey the
 On 30 August 2014, he overturned the proposal of Principal Secretary (medicine) and approved the proposal to increase 100 seats in the People's Medical College and Research Center in Bhopal
 unhone daleel di ki rajya main 5,000 medical siten badaye jane ke lakshya ko dhyaan main rakhte hue yah manjuuri di jaae
 But the arguments on which the principal secretary rejected the approval were no less strong
 pramukh sachiv ne kaha ki 2010 se 2012 ke bich college ne daakhilon main dhaandhlee kii
 Not only this, despite the recognition of 145 seats in 2011, 250 seats were admitted
 bhartiya chikitsa parishad (emsiai) ne yahaan 96 admician radd karne kaa nirdesh diya tha
 In addition AFRC placed 2nd on the college
 15 karod ru
 a fine of Rs
 yani prashasan jis college kaa praaanpatr radd karne vaala tha, shiksha mantri ne usee par najare inayat kar di
 Mishra did not respond to India Today's phone and SMS messages on questions asked about this
 udhar, chiraayu aspataal ko lekar bhi aaropon kii kami nahin he
 Former MLA Paras Saklecha alleges that a DSP of the STF called a top official of the hospital 600 times, but was never officially questioned
 gwalior ke tatkaaleen nagar police dspi rakshpal singh ke bete kaa naam jab vyapam ghotaale main aayaa to 8 agast, 2014 ko darj karaae apane bayaan main rakshpal ne “chiraayu aspataal ke dow
 14 lakhs to Goenka ”
 dene kii baat kahi thi
 Despite this, no strictures have been done with the owners of the Viva Hospital so far
 udhar indore ke aravindo medical college ke sioo jiem khanuja ko janvari 2014 main apane bete abhijit kaa galat tareeke se piemti-2012 main sellection karaane ke aarope main giraftaar kiya ja chukaa he
 The arrest was not made on charges of rigging a private college
 yani nijee collejon kaa prabandh tantra ab tak kii jaanch se nibatane ke maamle main sayaanaa sabit hota rahaa he
 Some of these evidences point towards Vyapam's hitherto untouched and unsolved riddles
 sibiai ne supreme court ke aadesh par jis mustaidi se ne maamle ko apane haath main liya he or jis tarah jaanch agency bhopal main alag daftar banaakar puure maamle ko khangaalane vaali he, usamen nijee collejon ke prabandhan ke liye jald hi bure dinon kii shuruyaat ho sakati he
 These layers of Vyapam will bring many more big names in the scam gap, there is no more doubt
 vaise, indore ke anand raay or gwalior ke ashish chaturvedi is maamle main supreme court kaa darwaja pehle hi khatkhata chuke hai
 The court issued a notice in this case to the central and state governments
 ganatantr diwas parade main aatankwaadi hamale kii sajeesh rachi ja rahi he
 Seeing the tough watch, the terrorists have tried a new trick
 khufia agenciyon se khabar mili he ki is baar ek bachche ke zarie dehshat failaai ja sakati he, kyonki badi taadaad main schuli bachche 26 janvari kii parade main shaamil hote hai
 The country's intelligence agencies have warned that terror groups lashkar-e-taiba and jaish-e-mohammed have jointly planned for the attack on the 26 January parade
 khufia agenciyon ko ashanka he ki hamalaa 26 / 11 kii tarj par ho saktaa he
 In this operation, terrorists can include their minor fides in the parade of tableaux and school children coming out during the parade
 hamale kii ashanka ko dekhte hue dilli police ne bhi apni suraksha chaak chauband kar di he

 Tej Bahadur had filed the election against Varanasi seat of UP in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections

 But claiming the wrong information, the Election Commission had canceled Tej Bahadur's nomination and thus he could not contest against PM Modi even if he wanted to

 Tej Bahadur recorded the video and shared it on social media, which was discussed across the country
 tej bahadur ke is kadam ko biguef ne niyamon kaa ulanghan maanate hue unhen barkhaast kar diya tha
 Since then, Tej Bahadur has been constantly questioning the government and has challenged the decision of BSF in the court

 com / gn3xuhun11 Film actress and Kings XI Punjab team co-honor Preity Zinta has filed a molestation case against her old boyfriend Ness Wadia
 yah maamla dhire-dhire tool pakadta ja rahaa he
 Several shocking facts are revealed by the statement of the FIR and Preity's official
 priti jinta ne aarope lagaaya he ki ness wadiya ne unhen gaayab karne kii dhamkee di thi va kai baar saarvajanik jagahon par gaali galoch bhi kiya
 Preity Zinta has stated in her complaint to the Mumbai Police that she has known Ness Wadia for the last 10 years and she was also in a relationship with him at one time but is no longer in a relationship
 sirf profeshnal kaarnon se ek-duusare se baat karte hai
 He has stated in his complaint that Ness Wadia often misbehaved with him
 priti ne police ko jaankaree di he, 'vaardaat kii raat ness wadiya ne mere liye behad hi abhadra bhashaa kaa istemaal kiya
 Behaved in front of my friends and family in a way that insulted me
 ' unhone aage bataaya, 'ness wadiya ne us raat ko mujhe yah kehete hue dhamkaaya ki vah mujhe gaayab kara degaa kyonki meri koi aukaat nahin he
 i am just an actress and she is a very powerful person
 main apni jindagi main shanti chaahati hum
 But what happened at the Wankhede Stadium shocked me
 aaj main apni jindagi ke liye dar gai hum
 'preity has also given information that she has told BCCI officials about this several times
 is sijan main kings ilevan punjab ke achche pradarshan ke kaaran vah chup raheen
 She did not want the entire incident to have an impact on the team's performance
 unhone aarope lagaaya he ki ness wadiya ne unke peeth peeche kai baar bhala-bura kaha va unke charitra par bhi sawaal uthaae
 Apart from this, melee in public places
 kya hua tha us raat copriti jinta ke ek kareebi ne bataaya, ness wadiya ne us raat priti ke haath pakadakar gaali galoch kii
 At that time there were many logos
 ve sabhi log is ghatana ke gavaah hai
 Ness not only held Preeti's hand, but also used very lewd language
 meri jaankaree ke mutabik vah pehle bhi aisi hi abhadra bhashaa kaa istemaal karata rahaa he
 Preity remained silent as Kings XI Punjab performed well this season
 final se pehle vah team kaa manobal nahin giraanaa chaahati thi
 After the May 30 incident, Preity was confused about watching the match in the final
 haalanki donon logon ke liye alag-alag baithne ke intjaam kiye gaye
 Preity has always remained silent on this issue and has not even spoken to Ness Wadia in the last five years
 vankhede stadium kii ghatana ke baad priti ne police main shikaayat karne kaa man bana liya
 The shocking thing is that everything happened in public but none of the people present there came and helped Preity
 vah ladki he
 He alone faced this shameful incident
 lekin vah bahut hi majboot he
 That's why the police came
 priti jinta ne is cese ke bare main fasebuk par likhaa:'main bahut zyada dhani yaa powerful to nahin hum, lekin maine ab tak kii jindagi main aatm-sammaan hasil karne ke liye kadi mehnat jarur kii he
 i am deeply saddened that when i was first humiliated in public places, no one supported me
 is baar mere saamne koi doosraa vikalp nahin bachaa he
 This is the reason why i have to take bold steps
 kai baar aisi sthiti aati he, jab hamen apmaan ke daur se guzarana padataa he
 But we fool ourselves thinking that no one has seen what happened
 vankhede main kya hua, ise duusari managasaint baton kii tarah hi nazarandaaj kiya ja rahaa he
 Nobody wants to know what happened to me
 mujhe yakeen he ki ghatana ke gavaah sach bolenge
 i am sure that the police will take appropriate and swift action in this matter
 koi mahila yah nahin chaahati he ki is tarah kii baat saamne aae
 i have worked in the film world for more than 15 years then
 lekin mujhe is tarah ke apmaan ke daur se pehle kabhi nahin guzarana padaa
 i humbly request the media to support me and focus on what happened to me at the Wankhede Stadium
 mujhe kisi kii sahanubhuti kii jarurat nahin he
 'on the other hand, Ness Wadia said that he was shocked by such allegations
 unhone priti ke aaropon ko bebuniyaad qaraar diya he

 bharat kii sabase tej chalane vaali train T18 dilli se banaras ke bich pradhanmantri kii hari jhandi ke baad patariyon par jald hi daudegi
 The railways had planned to run it before Kumbh but the delay was due to not having enough space to keep catering in the train
 iarsitisi (IRCTC) ne cataring ko lekar train main kuch badlaav ke suzav die hai
 The Railway Minister admitted that it is being implemented
 trial ke dauraan T18 ne 180 kilo meter prati ghante kii raftaar se daud lagaai
 On 26 December, the Railway Minister tweeted a video of Speed's new record
 lekin desh kii sabase tej gati vaali T18 kii gati patari par utaarne main dhimi pad gai
 Actually, the train does not have enough space to hold food and materials
 agar khaanaa rakhane kii jagah nahin badhaai gai to toilet ke aasapaas bhojan rakhana padataa
 Hence IRCTC gave suggestions in this regard
 rail mantri piyush goyal ne is masale par sawaal ke jawaab main kaha ki jivan main 'only constant iz change' aapane suna hoga
 More improvement has to be done
 har cheez main suzav milen
 You most request that T18 will start, then you must travel in it
 or uske baad aapke or kuch achche suzav aaenge uske liye bhi ham tatpar hai
 It is said that there is some rift in the electrical and mechanical department regarding the certification of safety
 deree kii vajah yah bhi he
 But Piyush Goyal is saying that Prime Minister Modi will soon give the green signal to T18
 dilli se banaras ke liye sabake tej gati se chalane vaali bharat main hi dizin kii gai or bharat kii hi factory main bani hui mek in india ke inishiative kii train T18 thode hi dinon main shuru hone vaali he
 Banaras will travel from Delhi in about eight hours
 jo aaj fastest train us root par he vah isse lagbhag dedh guna samay leti he
 Experts say that the train undoubtedly touched a fork of 180 in the trial, but it is not possible to run at a speed of more than 130 kmph on the Banaras route, because the section has a speed of 130 on this track
 yani train kii raah philhal aasaan nahin
 Only the speed that can deliver fast can be the reason for its delay
 srilanka cricket team ke bharat daure ke liye star olerounder angelo maithyuj puri tarah se feet ho jaaenge
 Sri Lankan Cricket Board gave information about this
 maithyuj ke alaava, kusal perera or asela gunaratne kii bhi srilankai team main vaapasi kii ummid jataai ja rahi he
 These three players were not in the Sri Lanka squad for the recent series played against Pakistan
 srilanka kii team ko isse pehle is saal bharat or pakistan ke khilaaf kheli gai vanade or tii-20 siries main haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa he
 In such a situation, the return of the team of three players to tour India once again can give strength to Sri Lanka
 srilanka kii team 16 november se shuru ho rahe bharat daure mentin testmatch khelegi
 After this, the series of three odis and T20 matches will be played between the two teams
 srilanka cricket board ke mukhya kaaryakari adhikari eshle di silva ne kaha, ‘maithyuj or perera donon apni choton se ubar gaye hai
 Both will be thought to be included in the Sri Lanka squad for the tour of India
 ’srilanka ne limited overs ke apane pichley16 machaganvaae hai, jisamen use bharat or pakistan ke khilaaf vanade or tii-20 international donon siries main clinasweep kaa saamana karnaa padaa he
 The Prime Minister will make a statement in Parliament today about the controversy that arose on the joint declaration with Pakistan
 egypt ke shame al shaikh main pakistan ke saath saajha bayaan main aatankwaad ke mudde ko compojit dialog se alag karne kii baat ko lekar haal ke dinon main raajnneeti behad garma gai he
 The mention of Baluchistan in a shared statement also created a ruckus

 patna ke aar block se chalane vaali railway trek kii 71
 25 acres of land will now be owned by the Government of Bihar
 bihar sarkaar ne iske evaj main railway ko 222 crores rupee dene kaa faisla liya he
 On June 30, the Railways will hand over the ownership of this land to the Bihar government
 yah bihar or khaastaur par patna ke liye khushkhabari he
 For the last 10 years, the Bihar government was trying to get this land, but it was not possible due to the different ideological governments in the center and the state
 ab centre or rajya main endie kii sarkaar he aise main rajya sarkaar ke liye yah jameen paanaa aasaan ho gaya
 This is a big gift for Patna because on this land an 8-km 6-lane super highway will be built which will be connected to the JP Bridge in Digha
 bihar ke path nirmaan mantri nandakishor yadav ne kaha ki oktober main sadak nirmaan kaa kaam shuru ho jayega
 He described it as the biggest achievement of the state government
 unhone ajtak se baat karte hue kaha ki yah puure bihar ke liye badi uplabdhi he
 We were not engaged for this work from today, the state government was engaged in this work for the last about 8-9 years
 kitnerel mantri aesub logon ne baatcheet kii lekin upie sarkaar main baat nahin bani
 Incidentally, the NDA government was formed in both the Center and Bihar
 vikaas kaa dabl ingine lag gaya or ab iskaa phayda dikh rahaa he
 Nandkishore Yadav said that not only Patna but entire Bihar will benefit from this road being built on this railway line, especially people going to North Bihar as we will connect this road to JP Bridge in Digha
 sadak nirmaan main hogi badhaunhone kaha ki sadak banane main baadha to he, jagah-jagah incrochament he, patna jila prashasan ne is par karrwai kar di he
 There are also five temples along the railway line
 logon ko notice jari kiya ja rahaa he ki wo sthaan khaali kar den
 He said that we have to give 222 crore rupees to the railways which we will give before 30 June and immediately after that the railway will give us the land
 is saal ke ant tak shuru ho saktaa he kamvahaan se railway trek ko hataane padegaa or isi bich deepiar (detail project report) banane kaa kaam bhi shuru kiya he
 We hope to start road construction by the end of this year
 unhone kaha ki is sadak ke nirmaan main 2 saal kaa samay lagegaa kyonki yah bada project he aurbade projectmen kam se kam 2 se 2
 It will take 5 years, but we are trying to start work on this project by the end of this year
 unhone kaha ki 6 len kii sadak ke saath saath bich main metro ke liye bhi jagah rahegi, taaki bhavishya main is par metro kaa vistaar kiya ja sake
 Hi
 
 
 main raveesh kumaar
 So the Land Acquisition Act passed in the Lok Sabha
 ab kisaanon ke bachche chaparasi dryver nahin banenge
 Union Minister Virendra Singh said that 70 percent of the farmers own very small size land
 vah kahin bhi jaataa he to sifarish karata phirata he ki mere bete ko chaparasi dryver, conductor yaa police main lagava do
 Farmers should also get a chance to move forward
 congress sahit virdohi dal 50 saal se kisaanon ko tukade to daalati rahi he taaki ve mare nahin, lekin inhen aage badhane kaa mauka mat do
 Opponents, on the other hand, were rightly alleging that this bill is anti-farmer
 isse kisaan barabaad ho jaaenge
 Even after the debate between these two poles, the proposal for land acquisition amendment in Lok Sabha passed by majority
 loksabhaa main kendriya mantri choudhary birendra singh ne apane bhaashan se sabko hansaaya bhi or virodhiyon ko chakaaya bhi
 Congress must have once thought that why we did not use this leader in time
 itani si tarif sirf unki bhaashan style or bolte hue maahaul banane ke liye kii he
 How satisfied the opposition was with the change in the bill and how happy the farmers were, it will become clear in the coming days
 sarkaar ke paas sankhya kii kami nahin thi phir bhi vipaksh ke sujhaavon ke aadhaar par nau sanshodhano ko shaamil kiya gaya
 The opposition did not have the numbers, but it did get a chance to raise questions
 choudhary birendra singh ne baar-baar jor dekar samajhaayaa ki adhigrahan sirf sarkaar karegi or sarkaar ke liye hi hoga
 He was fighting the notion that the acquisition would be for the corporate
 ab nae bill main kitna kisaan ke liye he or kitna corporate ke liye dhire-dhire pataa chalegaa, jab sab ek-ek pravaadhan kaa adhyayan karenge
 He said that the provision of infrastructure is said to be corporate, but it also has projects like irrigation and roads
 soshal infrastracchar ko 'manzuri na lene vaale sector' se baahar kar diya gaya he
 There will be no acquisition for a private school or hospital
 industrial coridor ko bhi saaf-saaf paribhaashit kiya he ki rashtriya rajmarg yaa railway line ke donon taraf ek-ek kilometre zamin kaa hi adhigrahan hoga
 The farmers will have the right to complain or appeal in their district
 banjar zameenon kaa alag se record rakhaa jayega or visthapit parivaar ke kam se kam ek sadsy ko naukari
 Now it is not clear what level the job will be, because Chaudhary Birendra Singh said that the farmer is so helpless that he keeps recommending his children to get peons and drivers
 ummid he uski zamin par bani company yaa project main use acchhee naukari milegi
 By the way, the job of driver and peon is also good to be respected
 vaise bhashaa kii yah samasya ham news ankaron main kuch kam nahin he
 It is not clear whether there will be acquisition of multi-acre land or fertile land
 loksabhaa main matdaan ke dauraan kuch vipakshi sadsy sanshodhan kaa prastaav laae magar bahumat na hone ke kaaran yah gir gaya
 There was a lot of debate about the provision of social studies
 kendriya mantri ne kaha ki ise rajya sarkaron par chhod diya gaya he
 The state government can do whatever it wants
 congress ke saansad deependra hooda ne kaha ki sarkaar nae bill main shaamil kare lekin unka prastaav gir gaya
 Union Rural Development Minister Birendra Singh said in the Lok Sabha that first the survey of barren land will be done and a bank will be formed
 agar banjar zamin kisi project ke liye kaam aa sakati he, to bahu fasali zamin yaa upjau zamin kaa adhigrahan nahin hoga
 The pro-union farmer organization suggested the creation of barren land banks
 kya vaaki adhigrahan ke kaaran vikaas kii yojanaayen ataki padi hai
 Modi government has been claiming that many projects got stuck due to this UPA law
 unke paas zamin nahin he, lekin hamaare sahyogi shrinivasana jain kii report to kuch or kahati he
 Srinivasan made a lot of effort to know from the government that the list of projects which had stopped, got a list but no result was found
 udyog jagat ke ek bade samooh kii ek suchi zarur mili he, jisamen 1000 karod ke atake product ko shaamil kiya gaya he
 Out of 67 such projects, only seven projects have stalled due to land acquisition
 inaki saajha laagat 53,677 karod hi he
 That means only 13 percent of the entire investment
 sitambar 2013 main bhoomi vivaad ke kaaran sirf 12 project main hi baadha ai thi
 Two of these roads and two power projects have also gained some speed
 shrinivasana kii report ke anusaar yah list bataati he ki project rukne ke kai kaaran hai
 Of the seven projects that have stalled, six are road projects
 60 project puunji kii kami se lekar kai anya kaarnon ke kaaran atake hue hai
 It is not right to call land acquisition a villain
 choudhary birendra singh ne kaha ki agar adaalat ke aadesh ke kaaran project shuru hone main paanch yaa saat saal lag jate hai
 If you do not start the project in the next five years after taking out that five years, then the land will have to be returned
 yani adalati aadchan main lage samay ko nikaalane ke baad jo paanch saal bachataa he usamen project ko puraa karnaa hoga
 The Congress has not accepted even a single amendment of the government
 vipaksh ne maang kii he ki is bill ko standing cameti main bheja jaae
 The government's ally Shiv Sena did not participate in the voting
 shivasena kaa virodh rajya sabha main pareshaani main daal saktaa he
 The AIADMK, the Akali Dal supported the Modi government
 bijedy tiares or congress ne sadan se walkout kiya
 The government has even shown its commitment
 ise ab rajya sabha main paas hona he, jahaan sarkaar kaa bahumat nahin he
 But does the new amendment provide answers to all the questions, which were being raised by the farmer organizations

 'shahid ke saath kis kaa anubhav bhi kangana ko pasand nahin aayaa
 Kangana said, 'shahid's big mustache is very dangerous

 Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut said, 'took away so much money in such a short time
 ye ab sarkaar kii zimmedaari he
 The PM and the Finance Minister should fulfill the promises made in the elections ”
 mangalvaar ko hi chunaavon or raajnneetik dalon par nazar rakhane vaali sanstha ellection watch ne bhi chaunkaane vaale khulaase kiye

 ab meri kshetra main log account main paise jamaa hone kaa intazaar kar rahe hai'

 party ke saansad naresh agarwal ne kaha, 'mujhe lagata he ki hindustan ke liye kaala dhan sapana bhar rah gaya he
 Modi ji cached the issue in the election
 
 
 lekin ab cash nahin aayega'
 Whereas Trinamool Congress leader and former railway minister Dinesh Trivedi claimed that as long as there is black money in the election, no government will be able to do anything against it
 sawaal he
 
 
 Black money, which was the issue in the elections, will come back to save political pulls or this campaign to catch the shadow will continue

 Meanwhile, India's water crisis will continue to get lost in the maze of groundwater sources, waiting for the next disaster

 com / uwqnloqqgg Till now, there have been reports of terrorist attacks from Jammu and Kashmir
 bacchon or naujavaanon ko barglaakar patharbaji karaane kii jaankaree aati he
 However, now there is such a revelation, which is very disturbing
 kyonki ab ye baat saamne ai he ki dharm kaa chola pahane ek maulavee maasoom bacchon kaa shaareerik shoshan karata he
 All this has happened in Mondji, a small village in Sopore, just 60 km from the capital Srinagar
 ek maulavee par aarope he ki wo apane saath jinn (islamic manyata ke mutabik ek adrishy maanav jati) hone kaa bahaanaa banaakar kam umr ke ladakon kaa shaareerik shoshan karata tha
 He used to carry out his nefarious plans on the pretext of taking care (to cure)
 peediton ne sunai aapbeeteeaijaj shaikh naam ke is maulavee par iljaam behad sangeen hai
 It is not just one or two, but has made many minor boys a victim of their lust
 hamaare sahyogi akhbaar mail today ko aise kai bachche mili hai, jinke saath julm karne kaa aarope is maulavee par he
 Many of these children are now grown up, but that dreaded man still haunts them
 ek peedit ne bataaya, 'main jab 11 saal kaa tha, jab mere chachaa mujhe aijaj shaikh ke paas le gaye
 He did wrong things to me many times
 ek raat maulavee ke ghar par 10-11 bachche the, jinaki umr 11-14 ke bich hogi
 Aijaz Sheikh asked all the children to do wrong things from evening till morning
 wo hamen dekhtaa tha or phir sabase aakarshak bachche ko chunakar uske saath rape karata tha'
 'he used to exceed the limits of humanity' His genius was not just here
 balki uski seemaa kaa dayera kahin zyada tha
 The secret opened by another victim child is also disturbing
 peedit ne bataaya, 'aijaj shaikh ko bacchon kaa rape karne kii lat thi
 He raped in front of other children
 aisa alag-alag pojishan main karata tha'
 When a child fell to the ground in pain, the misdeeds of Ajay Sheikh, which the victims have told, not only reflect his generosity, but also humiliate humanity
 ek bachche ne apana dard sunaate hue kaha, 'ek baar usne meraa is had tak shoshan kiya ki main jameen par gir gaya or buree tarah jakhmi ho gaya
 i was so innocent that i asked myself, will i be pregnant with this? What will i tell parents about this, if this happens? The children used to trap such victims
 The story of Maulvi Aijaz Shaikh behind this game is also seen as a strategy of an expert player
 pir ke naam se mashhoor is shaks ke paas log apni museebaton kaa hal talashne ke liye jate the
 It is alleged that Aijaz Sheikh used to treat people, claiming to be the strength of the jinn
 wo kahata tha ki uskaa jinn sirf 14 saal se kam umr ke ladakon se baat karata he
 It is alleged that people used to get caught in this trap of Pir
 wo khud apane or aasapaas ke alaava rishtedaaron ke bacchon ko is shaks ke paas le jate the
 This Pir Sheikh used to use obscene tactics to exploit innocent children
 ek peedit, jo ab balig he, usne bataaya, 'shaikh aijaj ke paas hamen fansaane kaa ek tarika tha
 He used to embarrass us first and then base it against us
 hamase bahut hi ajeeb sawaal kiye jate the
 He used to ask us if we have ever had physical relations with a girl or do we like anyone '
 is peedit ne aage bataaya, 'uskaa pasandida sawaal hastmaithun ko lekar hota tha'
 a case has been registered against Aijaz Sheikh after the unfolding of Pole and Gaya jail
 us par ranbir penal code kii dhara 377 ke tahat cese darj kiya gaya he
 Also, the chargesheet has also been filed in the court
 aaropee maulavee philhal bel par jail se baahar he
 The next hearing of the case is scheduled for September 27
 khud ko bataaya bekasoormel today ne aaropee maulavee aijaj shaikh se jab baat kii to usne khud ko besakasoor bataaya
 Even his relatives were seen standing in favor of Aijaz Sheikh
 aijaj ke parijanon kaa aarope he ki ye iljaam sajeesh ke tahat lagaae ja rahe hai
 According to them, the families of the accused children had borrowed money from Aijaz Sheikh, who has not returned, hence such allegations are being made '
 bataa den ki ye maulavee shaadishuda he
 Apart from his wife, he has two boys and a girl

 The politics of manipulation has already started before the results of Lok Sabha elections 2019
 upie kii adhyaksh sonia gandhi vipaksh dalon ko ekajute karne ke liye sakriy ho gai hai or telugana ke mukhyamantri kesiar tisare morche kii sarkaar kii kavayad main jute hue hai
 In the midst of all this, to prevent Narendra Modi from coming back to power, the Congress can also bet on the formation of a government at the Center on the lines of the Karnataka model
 haalanki congress kii pehali koshish vipakshi dalon ke saath khud kii sarkaar banane ko lekar he
 Congress General Secretary Ghulam Nabi Azad has given big political signals just before the final and seventh phase of general election voting
 wo pehle congressi netaa hai jinhone kaha ki nattejey ke baad agar unki party ko pradhanmantri pad kii peshkash nahin kii gai to congress ise mudda nahin banaaegi balki ham kisi anya netaa ko pradhanmantri banane kii raah main roda nahin banenge
 The Congress aims to overthrow the peasant and anti-people BJP government from power
 gulab nabi aaazaad ne kaha ki agar centre main ek gathbandhan sarkaar banegi or yah bijepi virdohi partiyon ke sahyog se banegi
 If the Congress joins the government, the party will not make it a matter of prestige
 unhone daawa kiya centre main naa hi bijepi or naa hi endie centre main satta main aaenge
 It can be clearly understood from Azad's statement that the Congress will not lose its hands for the post of Prime Minister but can work on the strategy of forming a government by supporting the opposition to stop Modi
 darasal congress bijepi ko satta main aane se rokane ke liye centre main karnataka model kaa daanv chal sakati he
 In the Karnataka assembly elections, BJP had the highest number of seats and Congress was second and JDS third in number of seats
 pradesh main kisi bhi party ko bahumat nahin mila tha
 In such a situation, the Congress formed the government by giving the post of CM despite JDS having fewer seats to prevent BJP from coming to power
 haalanki rajyapal ne sarkaar banane kaa sabase pehle ofer bijepi ko diya tha, lekin vah bahumat sabit nahin kar saki thi
 The way the opposition parties have fought the election war against Narendra Modi in the Lok Sabha elections
 congress ke netritv main kaaphi dal nahin aae, jiske chalate dilli, uttar pradesh, pashchim bengal or andhra pradesh sahit kai rajya hai, jahaan congress ko akele chunavi maidan main utarana padaa he
 However, the Congress hopes that after the elections like 2004, all these opposition parties will work together to stop Modi from coming into the government
 darasal mana ja rahaa he ki is baar ke loksabhaa chunaav main kisi bhi party ko akele bahumat nahin milane ja rahaa he
 In such a situation, the Congress is making the first attempt to form its government on the lines of 2004
 isi maddenjar buudhvaar ko sonia gandhi ne vipaksh ke tamaam dalon ke pramukh netaaon ko phone karke poocha tha ki 22, 23 or 24 may ko dilli main hai
 Recently, Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu met Congress President Rahul Gandhi and discussed meeting of leaders of opposition parties before the result
 naidu ne 21 may ko baithak bulaai he, jis par kai netaaon ne 23 may se pehle baithak main shaamil hone se manaa kar diya tha
 At the same time, Telangana Chief Minister KCR has met with leaders of several parties for the government of the Third Front

 After the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's biopic film was banned, the Election Commission has now banned the trailer of Mamta Banerjee's biopic film
 mamata banerjee kii byopic film 'baghini' ke bare main chunaav ayog kaa kahana he ki isane CBFC se certificate nahin liya he
 The Censor Board has asked three websites to remove the trailer of the film

 After getting the report, the Election Commission will look into the biopic
 chunaav ayog ne film kaa trailor dikhaa rahi teenon websites se ayog ke nirdeshon kaa ulanghan karne kii baat bhi kahi he
 The Commission said that the film has not yet been passed by the Censor Board for Film Certification and despite this its trailer was being shown

 My biopic has nothing to do with it
 yadi kuch yuva koi jaankaree ekatra karke kuch failaa rahe hai to ye unka nijee maamla he
 There is no connection with us

 While till now MHSA ads were also coming with the same tag line that the film is being released on Eid
 main hum shahid afridi ke riter choudhary bhi is baat ko kubul karte hai
 He said that it is true that no one can compete with Shahrukh's big budget film
 us par ye rohit shetty kii film he, jinhone kabhi flop nahin di
 After Shahrukh, there will be a challenge of Akshay Kumar, it is not that after passing Chennai Express, i am Shahid Afridi's path will be easy

 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he) The Union Cabinet on Wednesday approved ordinance (ordinance) making triple talaq a punishable offense
 buudhvaar raat hi raashtrapati ne is par hastakshar kar die
 With this mandate, it is clear that BJP is working seriously towards getting maximum votes of more and more women in the upcoming assembly elections
 bijepi asal main muslim maton ke vibhaajan kii ranneeti par kaam kar rahi he
 Through this ordinance, it is an attempt to divide Muslim votes into male-female and Muslim women's votes into their court
 yah bhi saaf he ki is adhyadesh se loksabhaa chunaav se zyada vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan vot hasil karne kaa lakshya he
 The reason for this is that the time period of the triple talaq ordinance will be six months only
 iske pehle hi modi sarkaar ko muslim mahila (vivaah adhikaar sangrakshan) bill 2017 ko paarit karana hoga
 The last effective session of Parliament is now under the tenure of this government, which can start in November or December
 yah bill loksabhaa dwaara paarit ho chukaa he or rajyasabha main lambit he
 The Monsoon Session of Parliament started on 18 July and ended on 10 August
 iske baad modi sarkaar ne adhyadesh laane ke liye kareeb dedh maheene kaa intjaar kiya
 Assembly elections will be held in five states of MP, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Mizoram and Telangana in the next few months
 telugana main muslimon kii badi jansankhya he
 But there Assembly elections may be held along with the Lok Sabha itself
 tripal talaak par ordinance se yah lag rahaa he ki bijepi khaskar vidhansabha vaale chaar rajyon kii muslim mahilaon ko prabhavit karne kii koshish kar rahi he
 But Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad gave some other reason for this
 cabinet meeting ke baad media se baat karte hue unhone kaha ki behad jaruri hone or taatkaalik aavashyaktaa kii vajah se aisa karne ko majaboor hui
 He said that 430 cases of triple talaq have come to the notice of the government from January 2017 to September 13 this year
 supreme court ke tripal talaak par nirnay ke baad bhi 201 maamle saamne aae hai
 He claimed that Muslim women are facing a lot of difficulty with this, especially in UP where there have been 246 cases of triple talaq since January 2017
 ab yah sochna hoga ki sarkaar ke liye kya itani taatkalikta or majaburi thi, ki vah do maheene or intjaar nahin kar sakati thi
 It is not yet decided whether the triple talaq bill will be passed in the winter session
 agar vidhansabha chunaavon main ordinance kaa hathiyaar kaamyaab rahaa, to phir loksabhaa chunaavon main bhi sarkaar nishchit rup se yah doharayegi
