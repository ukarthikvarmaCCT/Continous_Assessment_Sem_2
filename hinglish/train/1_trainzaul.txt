 It is such a Hindi which is neither Sanskritist nor influenced by English words
 kul milakar parampara or aadhuniktaa ko saath-saath lekar aage badaae kii koshish he
 He is right to say
 yuva hindi kii aisi kitaaben pasand kar rahe hai jo samajhane main aasaan or unako chooti hui nikalen
 "the language of the tavern is such that it is lyrical and easy to understand," says Vikrant
 '' vaise aarope lag rahe hai ki kitaaben bazaar ke mutabik likhi ja rahi hai
 Shailesh says, "books should not be written according to the market, but should become the books market
 hindi ke prakaashak kitabon ke prachaar-prasar main peshewar tareeke se prayaas nahin karte isliye yuvaaon main unki hawa tak nahin he
 "the next stop is that e-bookshindi books have also reached the e-book platform, and there they have started knocking among their target readership
" naveen bataate hai ki harper collins se prakashit kahaniyaan, bejaan daaruwala kaa rashifal or surendra mohan pathak ke popular upanyaas i-books main sarvaadhik bikne waalon main hai
 On the other hand, the entire business of Juggernaut Publication is app based
 unhone angreji kii kitabon ke liye ap launch kar di he, or isko ek lakh logon ne downlod bhi kar liya he
 This app is free, similar preparations are being done for Hindi as well, and Hindi app will also be launched in the next two-three months
 jagarnott publication kii hindi kii pramukh renu agaal kahati hai, ''hamane hindi ke kuch lekhakon kaa chayan kiya he or ham vibhinn prakashkon ko bhi apni ap par laaenge, jisase pathakon ko ek hi jagah dher sari saamagree mili

 He is also preparing to forge a relationship between readers and writers

 This is also happening in English
 '' unki taiyaari aise lekhakon kii kritiyaan bhi laane kii he jo copirite ke daayre se baahar ho chuke hai
 How ready is the Hindi reader class app? Pranav Johri, marketing director at Rajpal & Sons, believes that e-books in India are still in a very early stage
 ve kehete hai, ''videsh main to kuch samay pehle i-books main bahut teji ai thi lekin ab halaat badale hai
 Only textbooks sell more
 litarechar or fiction main to kitaaben hi pasand kii jaati hai
 There is not much impact of e-books in India
 '' online bikri hindi prakaashak or lekhak, donon ke liye phaayde kii baat he lekin lanbaa safar tay karnaa abhi baaki he kyonki self help, non-fiction or inspireshnal books main hindi ke lekhak na ke baraabar hai, jabaki anudit kitaaben hit hai
 Shailesh says, "the online market of Hindi books can be increased more than a thousand times
 '' The chill air of November is pointing to the falling mercury of temperature
 lekin hare shawl main lipati 54 varshiya rabari devi kadakadaati thand se beparwaah dikh rahi hai
 After completing a morning walk in the sprawling green complex of his government house on Circular Road in Patna, Rabri, sitting on a cane chair, was sipping pictures of the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) banner with lemon tea sips
 Huh
 saamne mej par ek cordleys ke saath do mobile phone (nokia or samsung ke basic model) rakhe hai jin par aane vaali kol par ve baaten kar rahi hai
 Lalu's trusted colleague Anwar Ahmed, who arrived shortly before, is reading the newspaper and interpreting the hidden meanings in the reports published in it, but Anamani Rabri's attention is not on the news, but on his 'sahab' Has been seen for two months
 rabari kahati hai, ''haa, mujhe akelaapan lagata he
 Which wife can be happy when her husband goes to jail? If Nitish Kumar and his team feel that they will break the party, then it is their idiot
 ham pehle se bhi zyada majboot ho gaye hai
 Actually JD (U) is breaking itself
 ”lalu ke jail main hone ke zikr par rabari ek pal ke liye udhaas ho jaati hai or unki ankhen nam dikhin, lekin unhone turant khud ko sambhaal liya or chehre par rukhi muskaan bikherte hue kaha, ''mujhe to unke jail jane kii aadat-si ho gai he
 Rabri says that even at the beginning of her married life, her husband was still in judicial custody
 1959 main janmin rabari kii 14 saal kii umr main lalu yadav se 1973 main shaadi hui thi or teen saal baad gauna
 But in the meantime, during the student movement against Emergency, Lalu was arrested and jailed several times between 1974 and 1977
 rabari kahati hai, ''maine apni puri jindagi main yahi dekha he
 In fodder scam cases, Saheb was imprisoned in one way or the other
 mujhe apane chote bacchon kii dekhbhaal kerani thi, jinhen yah bhi pataa nahin tha ki jail kya hoti he yaa unke pita unke saath kyon nahin rahete hai
 i had to take care of both the government and the family
 maine akele yah sab kiya he
 My children are now grown up and they can take care of themselves
 iske alaava ve party ke maamalon main bhi meri madad karte hai
 Now i can focus all my attention on the party and join hands with the leaders of RJD in their political struggle
 ”rabari devi ke lafjon se bahaduree jhalak rahi he
 But life without Lalu seems very difficult at this time
 samay badal gaya he—jab disambar, 2001 main lalu 35 din ke liye jail gaye the, uske mukaable samay kuch zyada kharaab ho gaya he
 During that time the situation was completely under control, Rabri Devi was the Chief Minister of Bihar and Bihar Lalu's Jagir
 30 sitambar ko chaara ghotaalaa maamle main lalu doshi tehraae gaye
 Prior to that, he had been sent to judicial custody six times from July 1997 to December 2001
 us dauraan rabari devi hi bihar kii mukhyamantri thim, lekin ve kabhi apane sahab ko dekhne jail nahin gayi
 Party people say that she cannot see him in such a condition
 lalu kii pichhali jail yatra ke ek dashak se bhi zyada samay baad aaj rabari devi ko kai chunautiyon kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he jinamein sabase badi chunauti he lalu ko jail hone ke baad bihar main apni maujuudagi ko praasangik banaae rakhana, kyonki pichley samay ke mukaable maujuuda sthiti yah he ki adaalat main doshi sabit hone kii vajah se lalu 2014 kaa loksabhaa chunaav ladgaye kii paatrata kho chuke hai
 Soon after Lalu's conviction, senior JD (U) minister Narendra Singh invited 'good RJD leaders' to join Nitish's party, which was seen as Nitish's alleged strategy to break the rjd's desperate leaders 
 rabari kahati hai, ''mujhe pataa he ki yah sab nitish kar rahe hai
 They are trying to break our party
 vidhaan parishad main jab bhi ve mere saamne aate hai, mujhase ankhen nahin mila pate
 There was a time when he used to sit in our house till 2 o'clock at night to listen to the words of Saheb
 aaj jab laluji jail main hai to ve hamen barbaad karne kii koshish kar rahe hai
 Nitish is not just worried about the party's challenge from within and outside, but he also has the burden of keeping his party united, with three Lok Sabha mps who have been public representatives since the birth of Lalu's successor Tejashwi Yadav
 yah mushkil sthiti he
 While Lalu cannot contest elections due to disqualification, there is a possibility that many senior RJD leaders will not be ready to consider 24-year-old Tejashwi as their top leader
 isi vajah se rabari kii rajnatik bhoomika or bhi mahatvapurn ban gai he
 Rabri has played many roles in Lalu's life
 bhartiya raajnneeti main satta kii viraasat thamane kaa sabase naatakeey drishy us din dekhne ko mila jab nau bacchon kii maa rabari devi ko 25 july, 1997 ko bihar kaa mukhyamantri pad saunpa gaya tha
 She is perhaps the only Chief Minister who arrived at the tear-filled oath ceremony
 chaara ghotaalaa maamle main sibiai kii ore se daakhil chargeshit ke baad lalu prasad ko mukhyamantri pad chhodie ke liye majaboor hona padaa
 Rabri Devi, completely unknown in political circles, was installed as the Chief Minister of Bihar
 haalanki, 2000 main argedy ne ek baar phir vidhansabha chunaav main jeet hasil kii, lekin lalu prasad ne rabari ko hi mukhyamantri ke pad par barkaraar rakhaa
 After being sentenced by Ranchi's CBI court on 30 September, Lalu Prasad has once again played his cards with great care
 atakalein thim ki ve rabari ko apana uttaradhikari niyukt karenge, lekin lalu ne aise kisi bhi kadam ko uthaane se parhez kiya or party ke anya varisht netaaon kii ore se rakhe gaye samuhik netritv ke vichaar kaa samarthan kiya
 It is possible that RJD will devise a formula for collective leadership due to Lalu's jail term, but Rabri will have to bear the responsibility of the result clearly
 rabari ne apane pati se bhi zyada lambey samay tak bihar ke mukhyamantri ke rup main kaam kiya he
 Today, there is no hesitation or reluctance in rising Rabri's footsteps to take responsibility at the behest of her husband which was reflected when he was made Chief Minister in 1997
 chal padaa rabari-rathrabari ne 18 november se rajya kaa daura shuru kiya or bihar ke darjanon jilon main argedy kii parivartan yatra kaa sanchaalan kiya
 The kind of crowd that Rabri's public meetings have attracted is enough to make his opponents sleep
 paliganj kii ore badhata unka kafila jab patna ke muslimbahul ilaake phulavarisharif se gujara to bheed ne lalu prasad ke paksh main naare lagaate hue phool maalaon se unka swaagat kiya
 It is clear that even after Lalu's conviction, the Muslims of Bihar have not left his party
 yah baat alag he ki lalu ne patni se koi prerana lee he yaa nahin, par sankat kii sthiti main unhone hameshaa rabari kaa sahaara liya he or uske sakaaratmak nateezon kaa laabh bhi uthaaya he
 RJD has always been Lalu Prasad's party, but since Lalu's jail in July 1997 in the fodder scam case, Rabri took over the command and gave his party and government several other aspiring leaders including his two brothers, Sadhu Yadav and Subhash Secured and kept beyond reach
 aaj jab lalu doshi sabit hone kii vajah se loksabhaa saansad ke rup main ayogy ghoshit ho chuke hai, ek baar phir rabari unki ore se party kii dekharekh kar rahi hai
 Rabri retired in a way after losing in the 2010 assembly elections, but Lalu pulled her back into the mainstream of politics on May 2012 by nominating her as a member of the Legislative Council
 argedy ke andruni sutron kii maane to yah sochi-samajhi ranneeti thi jo chaara ghotaalaa maamle ko dhyaan main rakhte hue taiyaar kii gai thi
 Raising sympathy is not an easy task
 ek senior argedy netaa kaa kahana he, ''jab tak hamaare samarthakon kii chintaa lalu se judi he, tab tak argedy ko isse phayda hoga
 But if our supporters start feeling sad for Lalu, then this situation can go against us, because then they can join hands with Narendra Modi's BJP to punish our biggest electoral enemy Nitish Kumar
 jharkhand hycourt se lalu kii jamaanat yachika khaarij hone ke baad hamaare samarthakon main punap rahi hataasha chintaa kaa vishay he
 In such a situation, the Parivartan Yatra going on in Rabri's operations is playing an important role in keeping the focus of our supporters
 ”rabari ne lalu kii gaiyr-maujuudagi main rajnatik paripakvata dikhaai he
 As soon as Narendra Modi tried to woo the rjd's muslim-yadav vote bank, Rabri immediately opened the front
 27 aktubar ko modi ne patna kii apni hunkaar raily main mahabharat se jude vaakye kaa hawala dete hue yadavon ko apane paale main karne kii koshish kii thi
 Which are recognized as Lalu's most committed vote bank in Bihar
 unhen krishna ke vanshaj kehete hue narendra modi ne unka dhyaan rakhane kaa vaada kiya or kaha ki ve us dwarika se aae hai jise krishna ne mathura ke baad apni karmbhumi banaai thi
 The next day Rabri appeared with around 100 burqadhari women and Yadav leaders
 vahaan photographeron ke liye pravesh khulaa tha or rabari muslim mahilaon ke saath hans-hanskar baaten kar rahi thim
 Undaunted by Lalu's absence, rjd's traditional Yadav and Modi's clean attempts to pull the Muslim vote bank towards him, Rabri objected to the Chief Minister of Gujarat by weighing him
 unhone kaha ki gujarat main hue dangon or uske baad to modi ko yadavon or musalamaanon kaa dhyaan nahin aayaa
 Due to the social equation of muslim-yadav, Lalu ruled the state for 15 years
 ye donon samooh rajya kii kul aabaadi kaa 30 fisadi hai
 bjp's Yadavs: Narendra Modi and Nitish Kumar are trying hard to bring this traditional vote bank of RJD into their court before the Lok Sabha elections
 narendra modi kaa dhyaan jahaan yadav vot bank par he, vahiin nitish rabari ke paale se musalamaanon ko khinch lenaa chaahate hai
 Rabri targets both of them in her own style
 "when LK Advani tried to consolidate his communal agenda in Bihar, Laluji arrested him
 dharmanirpekshata or alpsankhyakon ke liye sirf jubaan chalaane vaale nitish ne us narendra modi ko do baar rajya ke mehmaan ke taur par bulaayaa jis par alpsankhyak kabhi bharosa nahin kar sakate
 "RJD leaders believe that Nitish has secured the support of a section of Muslims by severing ties with BJP on Modi's issue, but he is confident that even after this, minorities will vote for Lalu's candidate because of defeating BJP Kuvvat is much more in RJD
 argedy ke ek sheersh netaa ke mutabik, ''musalmaan hameshaa usee pratyaashee ko vot dete hai jisamen bijepi ko haraane kii kuwwat ho
 The 2009 Lok Sabha and 2010 state assembly elections saw a different trend when some Muslims voted in favor of the NDA because of Nitish
 ab narendra modi bijepi ke sabase bade netaa ban chuke hai to musalmaan apni buniyadi ranneeti par waapas aaenge or argedy ke liye vot karenge kyonki bihar kaa akelaa sabase bada jaateey samudaay 'yadav’ lalu ko doshi tehraae jane ke baad or bhi majbootee se unke saath khadaa ho gaya he
 "what will be the sympathy wave? Banners adorned at Rabri's rallies are essentially making Chhath Puja to Rabri and showing Lalu behind bars
" jaahir he, iskaa uddeshy sahanubhuti kii lahar paidaa karnaa he
 Also, the manner in which Rabri addresses the public eye by addressing them is a direct indication that the party is ready to fight every trouble
 reliyon main rabari aksar puuchhati hai, ''kya aapako lagata he ki pichde, atyant pichde virgon, daliton or alpsankhyakon ke liye ladaai ladgaye vaali aawaaj ko dabaakar jail main band kar dena chahie? bheed jawaab detii he, ''kabhi nahin
 
 
 never
 ” rabari logon se kahati hai, ''laluji nirdosh hai
 They have become victims of the political conspiracy of our rivals
 samay aa gaya he ki aap ekajute rahen or sampradayik takaton kaa saamana karen
 JD (U) and BJP have deep inside friendship
 agar rajya main garibon kaa shashan waapas laana chaahate hai to aapako in donon ke khilaaf laduya hoga
 "what will the Congress newspaper do when the news of nitish-sushil Modi's quarrel is over," Rabri is quietly engaged in contacting the supporters
 kabhi-kabhi ve man kii baaten bhi kholti hai: ''bijepi ravan he, to jedy (you) kansa
 Together they fooled people and have been plundering Bihar for more than seven years
 ” argedy ko ummid he ki congress antat: uske saath hi gathbandhan banaaegi
 Rabri says, "they must be seeing how angry people are with Laluji being treated
" ” rabari apane gaanv salaarkalan ke praathmik skool kii shiksha bhi puri nahin kar pai thim
 They were married at a very young age

 The mobile phone rings once again
 yah kisi jaanane vaale kaa phone he or unke chehre par muskaan bikhar jaati he
 Rabri takes the call
 phone karne vaale ko hold par rakh apane bete tej pratap ko laptop ke saath bulaane ke liye anwar ko kahati hai jisase tasveeron ko chunane main ve unki madad kar saken

 ikkis farvari ko ek anokhi baat hui: apane puraane pratidwandviyon mulaayam singh yadav ke pote tej pratap singh yadav or lalu prasad kii beti rajalakshmi ke tilak samaaroh main pradhanmantri narendra modi shaamil hue
 However, it is common for the Delhi Durbar to attend family gatherings of rivals
 sach to yah he ki sabhi rajyon kii rajdhaniyon main bhi aisa hota rahata he
 But old observers keeping an eye on the BJP say it was not common for Modi
 haalanki mulaayam singh ke garh saifai tak modi kii yatra kii vajah samajhnaa mushkil nahin he
 There were only two days left for the budget session of Parliament to begin
 aise main tamaam vidheyakon kaa bhagya rajyasabha main vipakshi ekta ke str par nirbhar he, jahaan endie alpamat main he
 It is feared that this session may not be too much like a winter session, in which the opposition mps allowed the Rajya Sabha to work only 59 percent of its time and stalled the major bills
 iske vipareet, loksabhaa ne apane soochibaddh samay ke 98 pratishat tak kaam kiya, jahaan endie kaa vishaal bahumat he
 It was therefore necessary that relations be softened with Mulayam Singh, whose party has 15 members in the upper house
 ye nae modi hai
 Unlike the Chief Minister of Gujarat, who crushed the opposition, he did not even give him a chance to shout in the House
 unki sarkaar ne aam chunaav se kuch hi maheene pehle aktubar, 2013 main lokayuktavidheyak paarit kiya tha, jisamen sadan ke kaary main baadha daalane par puure vipaksh ko din bhar ke liye nilambit kar diya gaya tha
 He is also different from the Prime Minister of the Winter Session, who refused to budge at a time when opposition mps interrupted proceedings demanding his statement on the issue of re-conversion, among other issues
 shuruyaat main to lagata tha ki loksabhaa chunaav main aitihaasik jeet ke baad vidhansabha chunaavon main lagaataar safal hote aa rahe modi apane saath gandhinagar jaisaa sakht ravaiya nai dilli le aae hai
 Modi was out of reach for the opposition and those in his own party
 unki sarkaar ne rajyasabha main vipaksh ke bahumat ke prati beficri kaa sanket dete hue sheetakaaleen satr khatm hone ke baad jald hi kai saare adhyadesh jari kar die the
 But it seems that the results of the Delhi Assembly elections held in February this year have changed the picture
 ek jatke ke baad modi sarkaar puraani dilli-style kii aam sahmati kii raajnneeti main haath aajamaane kii koshish kar rahi he
 The same method, which has often proved to be helpful in rearranging fragmented relations of power and opposition, both inside and outside Parliament
 kam-se-kam kagaji taur par to aisa hota hi rahaa he
 It became clear on 24 February itself that this apprehension of the government was not without reason
 jab raashtrapati pranab mukherjee ke sadan kii sanyukt baithak ko sambodhit karne ke ek din baad puraa vipaksh-congress, sapa, bispi, sipiem, tiemasi or jedy (you)- teen vidheyakon ko waapas lene ke khilaaf ek saath virodh pradarshan karne laga
 These bills were: Insurance Laws (amendment) Bill, Coal Mines (special Provisions) Bill and Motor Vehicles (amendment) Bill
 sarkaar ko kadam peeche lene pade
 The TMC, the Left and the SP are considered old opponents of the Insurance Bill
 congress ko aapatti koyala khadaan vidheyak par he
 It is possible that even during this entire session, there will be tension over these bills
 lekin hangaamaa barapa he bhoomi adhigrahan vidheyak main nae sanshodhan ko lekar, jiskaa nayaa naam 'bhoomi arjan, punarvaasan or punarvyavasthaapan main uchit pratikaar or parrdishta kaa adhikaar (sanshodhan) vidheyak 2015,' rakhaa gaya he
 Immediately after seeking the Speaker's permission to introduce the Bill, the entire Opposition walked out of the House raising slogans and protests
 nichle sadan main bijepi kii takat ko dekhte hue sarkaar ke liye ise paarit kara lenaa sambhav he
 JD (U) president Sharad Yadav even went on to say in the Rajya Sabha, "the government is bent on trampling the opposition
" '' lekin asli baadha hogi upree sadan main
 However, the top government sources do not rule out the possibility of convening a joint session of Parliament if the opposition continues to veto the Bills
 thik isi mode par nai, sanshodhit modi ranneeti saamne aati he: mithi-mithi baton se vipakshi netaaon ko chuninda sahyog kii disha main badhaane kaa prayaas
 Government officials say that Modi sent Parliamentary Affairs Minister Venkaiah Naidu to meet Congress President Sonia Gandhi on the eve of the budget session
 satr ke pehle din modi khud galiyara paar karke gaye or unhone sonia gandhi or mulaayam singh yadav, mallikarjun khadge or biju janata dal ke bhatrurhari mehtab sahit anya vipakshi netaaon kaa abhivadan kiya
 By doing so, he indicated that he had backed out of his uncooperative silence over the opposition's demands in the winter session and now wanted cooperation
 donon sadanon main is aashay ke paryaapt sanket the ki bijepi ke netaa vipaksh kii kataron se sambhavit palabadaluon ko khush karne main koi kasar nahin chhod rahe hai
 The best evidence of this was found in the Rajya Sabha
 jab congress ke upanetaa anand sharma bhoomi adhigrahan adhyadesh par bol rahe the to vitt mantri arun jetali ne apni sarvshereshth jujharu kshamta kaa parichay diya
 But on the same issue, during the speeches of BSP leader Mayawati and SP member Ram Gopal Yadav, Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi appeared to give instructions to stop BJP members from tokatoki
 ab is bare main jaraa bhi andeh nahin rah gaya tha ki sarkaar rajyasabha main sankat se baahar nikalne ke liye in do dalon par aas lagaae hue he
 Even with the previous UPA government, these parties were mingling with important bills
 vastav main jetali isse bhi do kadam aage gaye
 He stood up to answer the issues raised to make both these leaders more happy
 mayawati ne kaha, ''2013 kaa bhoomi adhigrahan vidheyak sabhi rajnatik dalon kii sahmati ke saath laayaa or paarit kiya gaya tha
 But this (latest) amendment is anti-farmer
 '' unki ashankaon kaa nivaaran karte hue jetali ne kaha ki sanshodhano se kisaanon ko phayda hoga

 Seems we are always inventing new ways to destroy nature
 If these rich people want to protect their cars throw a wrap over them, this is animal cruelty and needs stopping
 Really this is so crazy, you couldn't make it up could you
 i mean stopping birds from perching in trees, whats next - maybe ban them from flying
 We need to round up all these human goofballs and force them to live below ground in the dark until they learn to appreciate nature
 Beat used to be used in expensive vehicles supreme court ne apni patni or bete kii hatya ke mujrim ko 35 saal kaid kii sajaa sunai he
 He was sentenced to death by the lower court and the Calcutta High Court
 nyaaypalika ke itihaas main shaayad ye pehla aisa maamla he jisamen court ne sajaa-e-maut ko 35 saal ke kathor karawas main tabdeel kiya he

 antariksh main jivan kii aakhri saansen gin rahe kuch taare apane aasapaas jivan se bhare kisi grah kaa suraag de sakate hai
 This is believed by Avi Loyab, theorist at the harvard-smithsonian Center for Astrophysics
 loyab ke anusaar, prithvi ke baahar jivan talash karne ke liye safed bouna athwa shwet vaaman taron kaa adhyayan karne kii jarurat he
 When a star in the shape of the Sun dies, there is a heavy bulge in its outer layer
 ubhaar ke baad jo tapt crod batch jaataa he use hi safed bouna kehete hai
 Loyb and his colleague Dan Maoz (tel Aviv University) estimate that by surveying the nearest 500 white dwarfs, we can find one or more planets like Earth
 harvard-smithsonian ke ek vaktavy main kaha gaya he ki yah utsahjanak nattejey ek nae saidhantik adhyayan se aayaa he
 It is assumed that the planets like the white Vamana stars are orbiting the earth
 isliye aasaan he pataa laganashvet vaaman taron ke grahon ke paryaavaran main oxygen kaa pataa aasaani se lagaaya ja saktaa he
 This is much easier than detecting the oxygen present in the environment of a planet like Earth orbiting a star like the Sun
 ek saamaanya safed bouna prithvi kaa aakaar kaa hota he
 It takes a long time to get cold and foggy, but it can have so much heat that it can heat the world around it for billions of years
 chunki safed bouna surya se chota or mand he isliye grahon ko iske kareeb hona chahie
 Apart from being habitable for the planets, there should be water on its surface
 yah grah kareeb das lakh mile kii duuri se safed boune kaa prayek das ghante main ek chakkar lagaataa he
 The issue of Jawaharlal University has returned again
 9 farvari 2016 ko kathith rup se deshdoh kii ghatana par jaanch agenciyon kii isse adhik gambhirtha kya ho sakati he ki teen saal main unhone chargeshit file kar di
 Otherwise it was felt that after providing ration water to the channels through this issue for weeks, the interest of the dock media has been lost
 us dauraan tivi ne kya kya gul khilaae the, ab aapako yaad bhi nahin honge
 What do you remember hardly any of us
 lekin ab jab police ne kanhaiya, umr kalid, anirbaan ke kilaaf chargeshit pesh kar di he to ummid he ki media 1200 pannon kii chargeshit ko padhane kaa ksht uthayega
 We have not read the charge sheet
 hamen puri jaankaree nahin he ki police ne apane aaropon ke sandarbh main kya saboot hone kii daleel di he
 Everything is based on what the sources have said in the court of police
 us par aane se pehle ham is maamle se judi kuch puraani khabaron ko yaad kar lete hai
 The appearance of dock media was revealed for the first time after this case came to the fore
 tivi par rashtrawaad ko lekar bahes chhid gai to jeenyu main bhi shikshakon ne khule aasmaan ke neeche rashtrawaad ko lekar lacture dena shuru kar diya jo sab utyub par he
 Many things collided with each other around the incident
 hyderabad main rohit vemula kii maut ke baad kuch jagahon par chaatro kaa gussa ufaan par tha
 Rohit Vemula was also mentioned in the slogans of JNU
 11 farvari ko is maamle main bijepi saansad mahesh giri cese darj karaate hai or 12 farvari ko kanhaiya kumaar, anirbaan or umr kalid ko giraftaar kiya jaataa he
 On March 19, 2016, these three get bail from Delhi High Court
 dhire-dhire media ke parde se yah cese parde ke peeche chalaa jaataa he
 Now the media which was holding Anirban, Umar Khalid and Kanhaiya as traitors, Kanhaiya Kumar becomes the star speaker for the same media and they are called in the conclave of the channels
 kanhaiya ke sahyogi ne bataaya ki aath media kankalvay main unhen star vaktaa ke rup main bulaayaa or abhi tak kanhaiya 200 kaaryakramon main bhaashan de chuke hai
 We asked Omar Khalid if the channels called you like Kanhaiya, but the answer was that no, his statement went on, but no one called Umar Khalid in his Anchayat Panchayat type conclave
 aap us samay kaa media bhi yaad kiijie
 a videotape on which the police could submit a charge sheet after three years, they were made traitors in the public's view by taking that videotape
 shaharon kasbon main jeenyu ke khilaaf naare lagaate hue reliyaan nikaali gayi or chhavi banaai gai jaise jeenyu main padhai ke alaava baaki saare kaam hote hai
 At that time, Home Minister Rajnath Singh had also given a statement that those who raised slogans on 9 February have the support of Hafiz Saeed
 media ne yahi sawaal poochna shuru kar diya
 a news channel even ran a 7-minute video that JNU students are calling martyr Afzal Guru while in that seven-minute video, no student was seen shouting such slogans
 channelon par bold aksharon main likhe jane lage ki jeenyu main padhai hoti he yaa deshadroh par piechdi hoti he
 Newslaundry is a website on which you can see the article of Sorodipto Sanyal
 yah lekh 27 farvari 2016 kaa he
 This will show in which direction the media turned the incident
 media ke godi media main badalane kaa aupchaarik elaan kiya tha
 Sources have said that CBI has investigated ten videos in forensic lab which have been found correct
 to ek samay chalaa ki video sahi nahin he, ab baat saamne ai he ki video sahi hai
 Since then, the same media has never questioned why chargesheets are not filed, chargesheets are being made or phds are being filed in cases like ph
d in treason
 jis ghatana ko lekar channelon ne itnaa khoonkhaar rukh apanaaya un channelon ne kab kab ye sawaal kiya ki jeenyu maamle main chargeshit kahaan he
 Why is it not coming? yah maamla police kii jaanch kaa to he hi, media ke trial kaa bhi he
 Which now can neither be accounted nor justice
 media main kai tarah ke video aae jinhen lekar tab kai sawaal uthe the
 a year later, there was a news release in several media houses which was presented by huffpost in a nutshell
 india today ne exclusive report kii thi jisamen bataaya tha ki ucch padasth sutron ne bataaya he ki tathakthith anti neshnal naare lagane vaale kanhaiya kii awaz kaa sample sahi nahin he
 There were so many reports that it was also said that even the professors were raising slogans, but nothing was known
 us samay ke police kamishnar bi es bassi ne kaha tha ki kaaphi saboot hai ki kanhaiya kumaar ne naare lagaae tab dilli sarkaar isamen kud padi or apni taraf se magistrate jaanch bitha di
 Kanhaiya Kumar got a clean chit in the magistrate's investigation
 hamaare sahyogi mukesh singh senger ne bataaya ki bhrashtachar ke maamle main 60 dinon ke bheetar chargeshit pesh kerani hoti he, gambhir aparaadh ke maamle main 90 dinon main or aatank ke cese main 180 dinon main
 But sometimes the situation can be different
 phir bhi teen saal baad chargeshit pesh hui he
 Police say the delay was because the investigation and identification of the accused took time
 ab patiala house court is par sangyaan legaa, phir chargeshit saare aropiyon ko bhi di jaaegi or trial chalegaa
 Only then can the things in the charge sheet be properly disclosed in the media
 kanhaiya anirbaan or umr khalid par 124e ke tahat deshadroh, dhara 147 ke tahat jhagada fasaad failaana, 120bi yani aapraadhik saazish, 143 avaidh dhang se jamaa hona, 149 ek lakshya ke liye milakar aparaadh karnaa, dhara 323 jaanboojh kar nuksaan pahunchaana, 465 jaalsaaji karnaa ityadi aarope lage hai
 a total of 46 people have been charged by the police
 10 mukhya aaropee hai
 There are also 7 Kashmiri youth
 inamen se kuch jamiya ke hai, eemyu ke hai or jeenyu ke hai
 They have been interrogated by the police
 36 logon ko kollam 12 main rakhaa gaya he
 That is, no evidence has been found against them
 inamen sipiai netaa di raja kii beti aparajita, sahala rashid, rama naga or ambedkar uniwarsity ke associat professor lahiri ke naam hai
 In JNU, there were programs to protest against the hanging of Afzal Guru and Maqbool Bhatt who are alleged to have raised anti-national slogans
 90 logon ko gavaah banaaya gaya he jinamein jeenyu ke chaatr hai, security guard hai, jeenyu prashasan se jude log hai
 Omar Khalid and Anirban have expressed their reaction to the news of the chargesheet
 unka kahana he ki ham dilli police grih mantralay or bharat sarkaar ko badhai dete hai ki aam chunaav se 3 maheene pehle gahari neend se jaage hai

 In such a situation, Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad has described this opposition coalition as a coalition of corrupt people, which is trying to tell that the federal structure is ending
 unhone poocha ki kya bhrashtachar kii jaanch karnaa paap he? aakhir rajeev kumaar kya jaanate hai jise chhipaane ke liye mamamta banerjee ko khud maidan main utarana padaa
 Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said that the Narada and Sharda scam was before the BJP came to power
 jisaki sibiai jaanch ke liye congress or vam dalon ke netaa supreme court gaye the
 After which the Supreme Court ordered a CBI inquiry into the case which included an investigation into conspiracy and money laundering
 prasad ne yaad dilaayaa ki congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne 8 may 2014, ko apane twit main likhaa tha ki 20 lakh logon kaa paisa dub gaya, jisaki bhartsana karte hai

 lekin tab mukhyamantri mamata banerjee na to dharne par baithi or na koi jawaab diya
 But what is there in the police commissioner, who was forced to sit on the dharna
 ye raajadaar bahut kuch jaanata he or raajadaar ko bachaana jaruri he
 After all, what does Rajiv Kumar know, tell this to the country
 ravishankar prasad ne kaha ki 26 april, 2013 ko mamata sarkaar ne sharada maamle kii jaanch ke liye SIT kaa gathan kiya jiske adhyaksh rajeev kumaar the, jo aaj kamishnar hai
 The CBI sent summons to Rajiv Kumar in this case several times, but he did not come
 jab aaio (jaanch adhikari) se poochtacha kii baat ai tab bhi mauka nahin diya gaya
 The Union Minister asked that when Rajiv Kumar did not come after calling him three times (CBI) would have told him so that he could go somewhere
 kendriya mantri ravishankar prasad ne ashanka jaahir kii ki sambhav he mahatvapurn sabooton ko yaa to nasht kar diya gaya he yaa isse chhedchhad kiya gaya

 26 / 11 ke aantki hamale main shahid hemanth karkare par kii gai tippanee ko lekar unki chautarafa aalochana ho rahi he
 On his statement, not only the opposition parties but also the leaders of bjp's allied parties are condemning this statement
 pragna thakur ke bayaan se pehle hi bijepi pallaa jhaad chuki he
 a few days ago, Pragya Thakur claimed that he was falsely implicated in the Malegaon blast case by Hemant Karkare, the former head of Mumbai's anti-terrorism Squad and that he was killed due to his deeds
 hemanth karkare mumbai aatanki hamalon ke dauraan shahid hue the
 At the same time, Pragya Thakur also described Hemant Karkare as a national traitor
 sadhvi ne kaha tha ki karkare kii maut 26 / 11 mumbai hamale main isliye hui thi kyonki pratadna se tang aakar sadhvi ne unhen shaap diya tha
 Now Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray said on the statement of Sadhvi Pragya that no one should make a statement that insults the martyrs
 sadhvi ne galat tippanee kii jiske liye baad main unhone maafee maangi
 Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis has already expressed resentment over this comment of Pragya Thakur
 unhone kaha tha ki divangat karkare ek bahadur or sahi police adhikari the or unhen shahid kaa darja diya gaya he
 Sadhvi Pragya's comment is her personal opinion and we do not support it

 main ek shahid ke khilaaf unke bayaan se aahat hum or ek naagarik ke rup main shikaayat darj karai he na ki mantri ke rup main
 i am demanding action against them as per law
 'thane main sadhvi ke khilaaf pradarshanrashtravaadi congress party (rakanpa) kaaryakartaaon ne shanivaar ko thane main bhi pradarshan kiya
 Also, activists shouted slogans against Pragya Thaku

 Sadhvi said on Friday evening that enemies were getting stronger with her statement, so she was withdrawing her remarks
 bataa den sadhvi pragna ke is bayaan par congress pehle hi sadhvi pragna ke rashtravirohi hone kaa aarope laga chuki he

 The Supreme Court on Tuesday issued notices to senior BJP leaders LK Advani and Murli Manohar Joshi and 17 others in the 1992 case of demolition of the controversial structure in Ayodhya
 donon varisht netaaon ke alaava, kendriya mantri uma bharti or rajasthan ke rajyapal kalyaan singh ko bhi notice jari kiya gaya he
 Kalyan Singh was the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh at that time
 court ne yah notice elahabaad ucch court ke us faisle ko chunauti dene vaali yachika par diya he, jis faisle main vivaadit dhaancha dhahaae jane ke 1992 ke maamle main unhen aapraadhik sajeesh ke aarope se bari kar diya gaya tha
 On 20 May 2010, the Allahabad High Court acquitted these leaders of charges of conspiracy in this 22-year-old case

 The court granted four weeks time to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to collect documents in its favor on a petition challenging the Allahabad High Court verdict absolving Advani and others from criminal conspiracy
 atirikt mahadhivaktaa niraj kishan kaul ne sarvocch court ko bataaya ki sibiai ucch court ke faisle ko chunauti dene vaali yachika ko daayar karne main hui deree ke bare main pehle hi ek halafanama daakhil kar chuki he

 The then bench of Dattu and Justice Jagdish Singh Kehar had on 4 February 2013 asked the government to file an affidavit on the reasons for the delay
 court ne sibiai ko chaar saptaah kaa samay diya or kaha ki vah kanoon, yachika daayar karne main hui deree or gun-dosha ke aadhaar par sunwaayee karegaa
 The CBI had approached the Supreme Court on February 18, 2011, nearly nine months after the Allahabad High Court verdict
 sibiai kii yachika par yah notice teen march, 2011 ko jari kiya gaya tha
 The CBI had said in its appeal that the decision to free people other than Advani from criminal conspiracy was contrary to the Allahabad High Court's February 12, 2001 decision
 elahabaad ucch court kii lakhanu peeth ne kaha tha ki sanyukt aarope patr par sangyaan lene main nichali adaalat ne koi galati nahin kii thi or us samay kiye gaye saare aparaadh shadyantra ko siddh karte hai
 Apart from Advani, Joshi, Kalyan Singh, Uma, Vinay Katiyar, Vishwa Hindu Parishad leader Ashok Singhal, Giriraj Kishore, Hari Dalmiya, Sadhvi Ritambhara, Mahant Avaidyanath were also charged in the case

 It states that electric vehicles have a huge potential in India
 isse lagata he ki centre sarkaar bijli se chalane vaali gadiyon ke liye plan bana rahi he
 This is not only because these vehicles are eco-friendly but also because India can emerge as a manufacturing hub for electric vehicles
 isse rojgaar or pragati ke avasaron kaa srijan hoga
 The review states that appropriate policy efforts need to be made to reduce the total cost of electric vehicles and make them an attractive alternative to conventional vehicles for all consumers
 2030 tak agar kul vaahanon main 30 se 80 fisadi vaahan vidyut vaale ho jaaen to carbon dioxide utsarjan main baari kami or badi maatra main tel kii bachat kii ja sakati he
 The Economic Review, citing the 846 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions policy, would be projected to reduce 30% of electric vehicles in private cars, 70% in commercial cars, 40% in buses, two and three by 2030
 If the wheeled vehicles reach 80%, then there can be 846 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions and an oil savings of 474 million MTOE
 isse vidyut vaahanon ke vinirmaan ke centre ke rup main viksit hone kaa avasar bhi milegaa
 Transport is the second largest emission area of carbon dioxide, referring to the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (2018) in the Economic Review that the transport sector is the second largest area of carbon dioxide after industrial sector in India
 desh main kul utsarjan main sadak parivahan kaa lagbhag 90% yogadan he
 Given the country's heavy import dependence for petroleum products, it is necessary to focus on alternative fuels to sustainably help our mobility
 jaaniye
 
 
 Reviewing the global status of how many electric vehicles run in which country, electric vehicles market share in China is about 2%, in Norway 39% while electric cars share only 0 in the Indian market
 06% he
 The review, citing NITI Aayog, states that two-wheeled electric vehicles have a major share in sales in India
 2018 main aise kareeb 54,800 vidyut vaahanon kii bikri hui
 Now it has become necessary that adequate number of charging stations are also built along the road network
 in vajahon se nahin bik rahe hai vidyut vaahanbharat main charging buniyadi dhaanche kii simit uplabdhta vidyut vaahanon kii khariddaari badhaane main mukhya baadha he
 The time taken for full charging of electric vehicles is also another problem
 aise buniyadi dhaanche ko jutaney or nivesh ko badhaane main desh ke liye vaishvik charging maanakon ke saath ek mahatvapurn niti banaai jane kii jarurat he
 It is also necessary to provide information about public chargers to users of electric vehicles through online maps and other means
 bharat main adhik taapmaana paristhitiyon main acchhee tarah kaam kar sakane vaali uchit bydaree praudyogikiyon ke vikaas kii jarurat he
 a mob of thousands of people, allegedly accused of rape in the Central Jail in Dimapur, Nagaland, were first taken out of the jail, then beaten to death
 hamaare channel ke paas is vibhats maar pitayee or janata dwaara us vyakti ko thok petakar maut ke ghat utaare jane kii tasviren thim
 But, we did not show those pictures on either the web medium nor on TV
 koun tay karegaa ki kis aparaadh ke liye kya sajaa ho? jaahir he adaalat yaa kanoonee prakriya
 Then when we have made law and order for any crime, then how right is it to be a mob and kill an accused or even guilty? The sad part is that our leaders are also unable to guide their fury through sharp statements
 haal hi main, nirbhaya par aadhaarit documentry 'indiaja doter' kaa virodh karte hue rajyasabha main saansad jaya bachchan kah gayi, yadi sarkaar nirbhaya ke repist mukesh singh ko lekar kade kadam uthaane main amasarth he to use hamen saunp de, ham uski 'acchhee dekhbhaal' kar lenge
 Note that the rapist has not expressed any regret for his actions in the documentary and all the blame has been laid on Nirbhaya
 par, yah to sach he! yah to hamaare samaaj kaa aainaa he! Justice is a very pious work
 ise har koi paanaa or kisi na kisi ko dilaanaa chahta lagata he
 But we do not have the time and need to see or share on how many shops we are standing
 nyaay ke saath sabase badi dikkat yah he ki yah kanoon or naitikta kii dudhari talwaar par rakhkar paaya yaa dilaayaa jaataa he
 One who allegedly does such justice sometimes justifies his step as a legal step and sometimes as a moral step
 khabaron main he ki haal hi main jis kaidi ko dimapur ke hajaaron logon ne maar daalaa he, use lekar bheed main sugabugahat thi ki ek bangladeshi hamaari ladki ko kaise ched gaya? BJP kii north east ikai kii netaa nevani ne to yahaan tak bol diya ki rape ko naga sosayadi bardaasht nahin karti
 Rape is not allowed in a society where rape is not tolerated
 After all, rapists are part of this society
 nagaland ke siem kaa kahana he ki rape kii abhi pushti nahin hui he
 In such a situation, is there even a chance that the person has not raped
 
 
 ? yadi maamla rape kaa tha to sajaa milani jaruri he or sajaa kya milegi yah tay karnaa kanoon kaa kaam he
 Think, what kind of barbaric society would we be if the mob continued to do justice due to this theft, sometimes robbery, sometimes rape or some other charge or defect! yadi ham kisi bhi maamle main bheed ko nyaay karnaa sahi maanate hai, dabi jubaan main kehete hai ki 'hona to yahi chahie tha, aise nahin sudharte apradhi' to hamen bheed dwaara hi dalit va adivasee mahilaon ko 'kulata' kahkar tamaam tarah se apamaanit kiye jane ke maamalon par bhi maun rah janaa chahie

 The ruling BJP did not like the criticism of the central government by Congress President Shahul Gandhi among Bahraini Indians in Bahrain

 Political differences should not be seen outside the country
 desh ke bheetar baat rakhane kaa unako adhikaar he
 It is right to criticize, but such things should not be done outside the country
 2- bijepi netaa shahanvaj hossain ne kaha, berogari to badi he, congress kii kai sarkarein chali gai hai
 Congress free India is happening in many places
 abhi himachal main unki sarkaar thi, ab vah nahin rahi
 Maybe their gesture will be on that side
 3- shahanvaj hossain ne kaha, imef ne bharat kii prashansa kii he, mudies ne bharat kii reating badhaai he
 Today India is recovering as an economic power and they are doing evil of the country by going abroad
 4- shahanvaj hossain ne kaha, rahul gandhi ko congress adhyaksh banane ke baad janaa to bihar tha, lekin vah bahrain chale gaye
 5- Husain said fire - Bahrain has a monarchy, there is no democracy

 The 2019 Lok Sabha elections have been held in the country and the candidates are filing nominations in the elections
 chunaav ke liye namakan prakriya ke dauraan sabase ahm cheez hoti he jamaanat raashi
 Also it is often heard that the bail of a candidate has been forfeited
 
 
 aise main jaanate hai ki aakhir yah jamaanat raashi kya hoti he, kitni raashi hoti he or yah kab jabt hoti he
 
 
 What is the bail amount? When a candidate fights in any election, he has to deposit a certain amount in the form of bail in the Election Commission while filling the form
 isi raashi ko chunavi jamaanat raashi kehete hai
 This amount is given back in some cases otherwise the commission keeps it with them
 kitni hoti he jamaanat raashi?jamaanat raashi har chunaav ke aadhaar par tay kii jaati he or chunaav ke aadhaar par alag alag hoti he
 From the Panchayat elections to the Lok Sabha elections, the bail amount varies
 yah raashi saamaanya varg ke liye or arakshit varg ke liye alag alag hoti he
 SC-ST class candidates have to pay more amount than general class candidates
 parshad chunaav ke liye jamaanat raashi?chunaav ke dauraan general varg ke ummidavaar ko 5000 rupye or arakshit ummidavaar ko 2500 rupye kii raashi jamaanat ke taur par jamaa kerani hoti he
 Bail amount for assembly election? According to section 34 (1) (a) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, general category candidates are required to deposit Rs
10 thousand and SC / ST candidates Rs
5000 in the assembly elections
 
 isse pehle yah raashi kaaphi kam thi or saamaanya varg ke ummidavaar ko 250 or essi-asti varg ke ummidavaaron ko 125 rupee raashi jamaa kerani hoti thi
 However, it was changed in the year 2009
 loksabhaa chunaav ke liye jamaanat raashi?vahiin loksabhaa chunaav main daavedaari prastut karne ja rahe general varg ke ummidavaaron ko 25 hajaar rupee or essi-asti varg ke ummidavaaron ko 12,500 rupee fees jamaa kerani hoti he
 Before 2009, this amount was Rs 10 thousand for general category and Rs 5 thousand for SC-ST candidates
 kab jabt hoti he jamaanat?jab koi pratyaashee kisi bhi chunaav kshetra main pade kul vaid vot kaa chatha hissaa hasil nahin kar paata he to uski jamaanat raashi jabt maani jaati he or namakan ke dauraan di gai raashi unhen waapas nahin milti he
 For example, if 1 lakh people have voted on a seat and the candidate has got less than 1 xxrep 4 6 votes then his / her bail will be forfeited
 kise waapas milti he jamaanat raashi?- jab kisi ummidavaar kaa namakan khaarij ho jaataa he yaa vah apni ummidavaar waapas le letaa he to yah raashi lautaa di jaati he
 - If a candidate dies before the voting starts, then this amount is returned to the family
 - agar ummidavaar kul daale gaye vot ke chathe hissaa se zyada vot hasil kar letaa he
 - If a candidate does not get as much as the sixth part of the vote and wins the election, then they are also given the amount
 2014 main kitni jabt hui thi jamaanat raashi?saal 2014 main 8748 ummidavaaron ne daavedaari prastut kii thi, jisamen se 7502 ummidavaaron kii jamaanat jabt ho gai thi
 That is 16 out of 7502 candidates
 6 fisadi vot hasil nahin hue the
 There were only 6 seats in the country where only the winning candidate's bail was saved

 Agarwal never wasted time and opportunity
 unka din duuna badhata kaarobaar isi kii gavaahi detaa he
 Agarwal's ancestors, who have 50 years of experience, migrated from Shekhawati, Rajasthan 150 years ago and settled in Delhi and Mumbai
 aazaadee se pehle unka kunba britain ke manchester or lankashair se kapadaa aayaat kar desh main bechata tha
 But he never liked this ancestral work of trading
 ve factory lagaana chaahate the
 68-year-old Agarwal received his B
A
 from Shri Ram College in 1968
 com karne ke baad tay kiya ki pushtaini dhandha nahin karuunga
 In those days the Green Revolution was in the news and was the latest thing
 log america se aae gehun ke liye line main lagate, phir bhi na milane par blike main kharidte
 There was talk of increasing yields
 parivaar ko tajurba sirf kapade ke kaarobaar kaa tha
 Aggarwal's father suggested that whichever line you would like to enter, enter it by trading
 unhone 25,000 ru
 He started trading fertilizers and then pesticides first
 tab bhartiya khaadya nigam or bhartiya urvarak nigam hi khaad aayaat karte the
 Meanwhile, the high-yielding variety of wheat came to India
 is harith kranti kaa sabase zyada asar punjab, pashchimi uttar pradesh, rajasthan ke kuch ilaakon or haryana main tha
 The problem before Agarwal, who wanted to set up the factory, was that the government had stopped giving licenses for the Pesticides factory
 so 1980 main unhone gudgaanv main bandi ke kagaar par khadi gujarati malikan vaali company nordarn minerals privet limited kharidi jo us vakt imperial chemical industries (isiaai) ke liye desh kaa pehla pastiside gamexine banaati thi
 The story started from here
 agarwal ne isamen rishtedaaron ko partner banaaya, logon se udhaar liya
 Its share capital is three lakhs
 or uskaa nuksaan paune teen lakh rupye tha
 Banks refused to give loans on seeing the balance sheet
 is par bazaar se paisa uthaaya
 The factory got skilled workers and the work went on
 gamexine banane lagi
 The product was weighed but the transportation was saved due to the factory being close to the railway station in Gurgaon
 us vakt pastisids kaa license gini-chuni multinational companiyon ke paas tha
 They would also have the raw material
 maangane par dete bhi to kehane bhar ko
 They also have import licenses
 agarwal ne koshish karke 1983-84 main ek karod ru
 Took import license of
 isse kachche maal kii dikkat dur hui or supplai badi
 His experience of 12 years of trading was used in marketing of the factory
 1985 main unhone sohana main pastiside ke kachche maal kii factory lagaai jahaan sypermathin or fenorlet banane lage
 They are actually controlled like the pharma industry
 yahaan har product kaa alag-alag license or registration hota he, jisamen krishi mantralay or rajya sarkaar kii manjuuri jaruri hoti he
 The company had a public issue in 1985
 vah mumbai, dilli or ludhiana main list hui
 His status increased and he started exporting
 bazaar main dhak jami to bahurashtriya companiyon se chunauti milane lagi
 After the deal with dupont in 1992, the company's story changed
 uskaa nayaa utpaada dunette bazaar main aayaa, jo illi maarane main khaasaa kargar sabit hua
 It was slightly toxic, so it was also given a mask made of imported cloth
 desh main pehali baar iskaa prayog hua
 It became the brand of the company
 bahut-si jagahon par police kii nigaraanee main saikadon log line main lagakar ise kharidte
 Farmers used to wait in mandis for three days
 chaar saal main 10 lakh litre chemical bik gaya
 But in 1996, dupont himself decided to come to India
 par tab tak duniya bhar main company kii pahchaan ban chuki thi
 Japanese companies also wanted to come to India
 1997 se dhanuka ke paas japani companiyon ke product aane lage
 They are currently selling new products from six Japanese companies
 2001 main unhone kuch america companiyon se saajha kiya
 Technical collaborations were signed with dupont, chemtura (now Platform), FMC, Dow Agrasciences, Nissan Chemical, Hoko, Sumitomo, Syngenta and Mitsui Chemicals
 company aaj bhi dupont ke utpaada bech rahi he
 Covers, Terga Super, Sapra etc
 are doing well with their own products
 par dhanuka ko 7-8 multinational or do darjan se zyada desi companiyon se chunauti mil rahi he
 10 crores in registering a product in India
 or paanch se saat saal lagate hai
 Starting with research, it takes ten years to develop a new pesticide and Rs 2,500 crore
 tak lag jate hai
 Research of new formulations is also done in Dhanuka
 uski lab eneelbi se manyata praapt he jise puri duniya main sweekaar kiya jaataa he
 a Royal Enfield bullet at the factory headquarters in Gurgaon often catches visitors' attention
 yah vahi motorcycle he, jo agarwal ne 1968 main kharidi thi
 It is placed there as a sign
 ''parivahan ke saadhan kam the
 We used to go from village to village with that motorcycle
 ek din main 300-400 kilometre tak naap diya karte the
 "wife Urmila was his strong support during that period of struggle
 do betiyon or ek bete ko ve hi sahejatin-sambhalatin or der raat main kabhi bhi pahunchane par pati ko hameshaa garam khaanaa parosatin
 However, Agarwal explains that the biggest difficulty comes when there is no rain
 ''2009 main barish nahin hui to hamaara kaam bhi dhilaa hi rahaa
 We performed a yagna in 2010 during the Chaitra Navratra in Vrindavan
 upar vaale kii krupa se us saal bahut acchhee barish hui
 "as of March 31, 2017, Dhanuka's business of Pesticides is Rs 800 crore
 tak pahunch gaya
 He says that "even today farmers are not aware of pasticides, while they are effective in increasing their yield
" desh main anaaj kii paidaavaar badhaane kii sakht jarurat he
 "aggarwal narrates an interesting incident related to the company's image
 ''aamir khan ke tivi kaarykram satyamev jayate main pastisids utpaadakon ko khalanaayak ke taur par bataaya gaya to meri potee ne mujhase sawaal kiya ki aap aisa kyon kar rahe hai? is par maine thaan liya ki jo galat chhavi banaai ja rahi he, uskaa datakar muqabla karuunga
 i went to Mumbai six times and finally returned only after making superstar Amitabh Bachchan the brand ambassador of the company
 "ve bataate hai ki haryana main sirsa ke paas ek gaanv main ve apane ek kitnashak kaa pradarshan karne gaye the
 As the medicine started spraying the cotton culls, a farmer insisted that he needed the medicine immediately
 unka daawa he ki vah kisaan dawa lene unheen ke saath dilli chalaa aayaa
 He considers the reputation of his products among the farmers as his greatest achievement
 unke liye ve bade yaadgaar pal the, jab 1994 main ve marathavada or andhra pradesh ke daure par gaye
 Tur is cultivated on 1 million hectares in this area
 us ilaake ke logon ko unke kitnashkon or khar-patavaarnashkon se jabardast phayda hua tha
 On arrival in the villages, people welcomed them by wearing shawls and coconut
 ''25-30 jagahon par aisa swaagat dekhakar man garv se bhar gaya
 There is more happiness than getting money
 "aaj bharat kii har mandi main dhanuka ke dealer hai
 The 1,500 employees of the company present in the field take its new products to the farmers and also provide training on its use
 agarwal kaa daawa he ki ve kisaanon kii aay doguni karne ke lakshya par kaam kar rahe hai
 Currently, the company has launched a new product called Sepra to destroy the paddy-grown weed called Motha

 Why was the police officer MK Meena Sahab so adamant? kya meena sahab ne aspataalon ke liye niyam bana diya he ki koi netaa aspataalon main jaakar peedit parivaar se nahin milegaa
 Is this rule for everyone? kya yah khabar aam nahin he ki ek purv sainik ramkishan gereval ne aatmahatya kii he

 upi ke auraiya ke eks soobedaar gambhir singh ko bhi maine phone lagaaya jo 2003 main lakhanu ke army medical kor se ritair hue the
 Gambhir Singh said that after retiring in 2003, he was receiving Rs 25,506 as pension
 unhen teen teen hazaar kii do kisht yani 6000 kii rakam to mili he, lekin koi pension order nahin mila he ki van rank, van pension ke tahat nai raashi kya hogi
 But according to which the 6,000 rupees were given, it is not known
 gambhir singh ne bataaya ki unke baad alag-alag unit or rank se ritair hue kuch saathiyon ke khate main 16,000 kii raashi ai he, to kisi ke khate main 21,000 kii raashi
 But everyone says that no one has written what their new pension will be, why 16,000 is being given
 zyaadaatar saathiyon ke khate main to pension kii koi nai raashi nahin ai he
 Most soldiers also complained that money from the Seventh Pay Commission has not been received, while many parts of the bureaucracy have been received
 jaan dene main to hamaare sainik ek pal kii nahin sochate to kya sarkaar ko unki pension or vetan kaa kaam bhi jaldi-jaldi nahin kar dena chahie
 At a time when army personnel are being talked about every day, questions are being pressed in their name, the news of suicide of a soldier is not normal

 VK Singh said that more than 90 percent of the demands at the officer level have been met

 There may be a difference in percentage, but it was felt that more than half of the retired soldiers have not received the installment of One Rank, One Pension

 Somebody's got nobody's got it

 See here also the officer's work is done first, the work of soldiers is later

 His sons are already talking to the media, then what would have happened if these people had met Rahul Gandhi or Manish Sisodia
 baharhaal shaam ko rahul ko chhod diya gaya
 a member of the Sainik Welfare Board said that there are 6,491 ex-servicemen in Etawah
 is daftar ke sutron ne bataaya ki zile main sirf 30 se 40 pratishat sainikon ko hi van rank, van pension kii pehali kisht mili he
 Every day someone comes to ask if there was any information about pension
 yahaan aane vaale badi sankhya main sainik bataate hai ki bahuton ko pension order nahin mila he
 One soldier said that fifty percent of the soldiers did not get the amount of One Rank, One Pension
 pratishat main bhale antar ho magar baton se laga ki aadhe se bhi zyada ritair sainikon ko van rank, van pension kii kisht nahin mili he
 The fellow soldier who accompanied Ramkishan ji who committed suicide, also said the same thing
 kisi ko mila he kisi ko nahin mila he
 Giving his father's army number, a person from Etawah said that Havildar Bhikham Singh, a resident of Lucknow's Village Post Garhi Chalty, has not received the installment of One Rank, One Pension
 milegi bhi yaa nahin, isaki koi soochna un tak nahin pahunchi he
 His son called his father's army number 2947955
 kaha ki 89 main ritair hue the or 11,000 pension mil rahi he, jabaki van rank, van pension kii raashi kaa abhi tak pataa nahin
 Union Minister VK Singh said that there are problems regarding the soldiers, but 90 percent demands of officers have been met
 dekhiye yahaan bhi afasar kaa kaam pehle hota he, javaanon kaa kaam baad main hota he
 Similarly, Havildar Balaram, who retired from an electronic mechanical engineer, told him over the phone that he retired in 2012
 abhi tak van rank, van pension kii koi kisht nahin ai he
 The pension of some of his colleagues has arrived
 van rank, van pension ke tahat nai pension raashi kya hogi, kitne kii kisht milegi, iske liye pension order nahin mila he
 Those who have received money in their account have also not received any pension order, how much should be received and how much is being given
 kam se kam hamane jitanon se baat kii, sabane ye baat kahi he
 i also called up Gambhir Singh, the Subedar of Auraiya, UP, who retired from the Army Medical Corps of Lucknow in 2003
 gambhir singh ne bataaya ki 2003 main ritair hone ke baad unhen 25,506 rupee pension ke taur par mil rahi thi
 They have received two installments of three thousand three thousand ie 6000, but no pension order has been received as to what will be the new amount under One Rank, One Pension
 magar 6,000 rupaya kis hisaab se diya gaya yahi pataa nahin hai
 Gambhir Singh said that after him the amount of 16,000 has come in the account of some of the fellows who have retired from different units and ranks, then 21,000 in the account of someone
 magar sabakaa kahana he ki kisi ke paas ye likhit nahin he ki unki nai pension kya hogi, 16,000 kyon diya ja rahaa he
 No new pension amount has come to the account of most colleagues
 zyaadaatar sainik isaki bhi shikaayat karte mili ki saatven vetan ayog kaa paisa nahin mila he, jabaki naukarshahi ke kai angon ko mil chukaa he
 If our soldiers do not think for a moment in giving up their lives, should the government not do their pension and salary work too quickly
 ek aise vakt main jab har din sena ke javaanon kii baat ho rahi he, unke naam par sawaalon ko dabaaya ja rahaa ho, ek sainik kii aatmahatya kii khabar saamaanya to nahin he
 This news started spreading from website to Twitter timeline
 dilli ke up mukhyamantri manish sisodiya or aap ke vidhayak commander surendra singh raamamanohar lohia aspataal pahunche
 The police detained them from there and took them to the Parliament Street police station
 mukhyamantri kejariwal se dhakkamukki hui, jisase unka chashma tut gaya
 The comments dopaher main hi congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi bhi aspataal pahunche
 Rahul Gandhi was also stopped at the hospital gate
 uske baad ramkishan gereval ke parivaar vaale baahar aane lage, lekin kuch pataa nahin chalaa
 When Rahul Gandhi insisted on meeting family members, he was also detained
 vahaan se rahul ko mandir maarg thane le jaaya gaya
 When the Congress leaders gathered there, the police released them
 rahul gandhi ad gaye ki parivaaravaalon ko reeha kiya jaae
 Departing from the Mandir Marg police station, he started walking around the police stations of New Delhi area
 pehle south avenue police chaowkee gaye, vahaan se conot place thana gaye, lekin jab mulaakaat nahin hui to vahaan se tughlaq road sthit apane ghar chale gaye
 Then as soon as it was learned that Ramkishan Gerewal's family is at the Connaught Place Police Station, Rahul reached there
 jahaan unhen police ne dobaaraa ditten kar liya
 By then, all the Congress leaders and workers reached there
 ab police ne rahul ko bithakar thane-thane ghumana shuru kar diya
 The police first took them to the Parliament Street police station, then to the Tilak Marg station, then to the Connaught Place police station
 vahaan samarthakon kii bheed thi, to vahaan se phir tilak maarg thane le ai
 But the question arises why Rahul was not allowed to meet the family of Ramkishan Gerewal
 police afasar emke meena sahab itane kyon ade rahe
 Has Meena Sahab made a rule for hospitals that no leader will visit the hospitals and meet the victim's family
 kya ye niyam sabake liye he
 Is it not common news that a former soldier Ramkishan Gerewal has committed suicide
 unke bete media se baat to kar hi rahe hai, phir in logon kii mulaakaat rahul gandhi yaa manish sisodiya se ho jaati to kya ho jaataa
 However, Rahul was released in the evening

 This news started spreading from website to Twitter timeline

 a very happy birthday @ irfanpathan! Biryani kab khila raha hai? - sachin tendulkar (@sachin_rt) October 27, 2016 Let us remember Irrfan today in the same style as the three acts he did against Pakistan first on Pakistan soil and then when cricket While watching the World T20 tournament of his new format, his final was also made special by Irfan
 nahin bhul sakate dhoni-irfan kii ye saajhedaarikai visheshgyon ne irfan pathan ko kapil dev ke baad swing or seem bowling kaa sarvaadhik pratibhavan cricketer bataaya
 a few years after his debut in international cricket, he was seen as an successor to Kapil Dev as an all-rounder
 aisa ho bhi kyon nahin? irfan kii jab bhi baat chalati he to mujhe sabase pehle 2006 main rahul dravid kii captaini main pakistan gai bhartiya team kaa faisalabad or karachi test yaad aa jaataa he
 Pakistan had scored 588 runs in the first innings in Faisalabad and in reply Dravid, Laxman, Tendulkar and Yuvraj were dismissed for only 45 runs after a 197-run partnership between captain Dravid and Laxman for the second wicket
 aise main team par foloon kaa khatra aa gaya or yahaan se pathan ne dhoni ke saath milakar 201 ranon kii saajhedaari nibhaai
 When Dhoni scored 148, Pathan missed his century and was out lbw by scoring 90 runs
 pathan wicket par tik kar khele or team india match ko drow karne main kaamyaab rahi
 In the next match, Irfan committed a feat which was never seen in Test cricket before
 karachi ke neshnal stadium main khele gaye is match main pakistan pehle ballebaaji karne utraa lekin unhen yah nahin maaloom tha ki irfan unhen kaisaa shuruaati jhatka dene vaale hai
 Irfan was handed the first over by Dravid and he wreaked havoc in his very first over
 match kii chauthi, paanchavin or chhathi gend par unhone salmaan batt, captain younis khan or mohammad yusuf jaise dhurandhar ballebaajon ko pavilion bhej kar wo na keval test maichon main harbhajan ke baad hetric lene vaale duusare bhartiya khilaadi bane balki iske saath hi unhone kisi bhi test main sabase tej hetric lene kaa record bhi apane naam kar liya
 Pakistan's score at the end of the first over was three wickets at zero
 cricket ke teenon formet par chodi chhapairfan ne 2003 se 2008 tak bharat ke liye 29 test match khelaa
 In this, he 31
 57 kii ausat se 1105 ran or kul 100 wicket liye
 During his Test career, he took five wickets in an innings seven times and 10 wickets twice in a match
 irfan kaa vanade kariyar 120 maichon kaa rahaa or is dauraan unhone paanch ardhashtakon samet 1544 ran banaae or 173 wicket liye
 Irfan took 28 wickets during the 24-match T20 cricket career of Pakistan in the World T20 final
 is dauraan unhone 2007 ke pehle world tii20 toornament main apni chhap chodi
 Irfan scored 14 in the tournament
 90 kii ausat se 10 wicket liye
 The feat of taking three wickets for 16 runs against Pakistan in the historic final made the team the winner of the tournament, while also giving them the title of man of the match
 bijepi daftar par patharbaji ke maamle main aam aadmi party ke netaa ashutosh or shajia ilmi ke bayaan dhara 161 ke tahat darj kiye gaye hai
 The Delhi Police has taken both to the Mandir Marg police station for assistance in interrogation and investigation
 vahiin, ashutosh ne twit kar bataaya he ki ve abhi thane ke andar hi hai or kuch hi der main unka medical test karaayaa jayega

 We raise our voice, not our hands
 mujhe lagata he ki agar hamaari ore se kuch hua he to yah pehali baar hua he or aakhri baar hua he
 Before going with the police, Ashutosh said that he is a citizen of the country who follows the law and will cooperate fully in the investigation
 kaaryakartaaon se shanti banaae rakhane kii apil karte hue unhone kaha, 'kisi bhi tarah kaa shor-sharaaba or hangaamaa yahaan nahin hona chahie
 We are non-violent Gandhians
 police vaale bhi desh ke naagarik hai

 Both parties are accusing each other of stoning

 Chinese model Ma Yinhong is proving the same by taking part in the Shanghai catwalk
 chamkile paridhaanon main or chote-daai kiye hue baalo main vah behad confident najar aati hai
 Ma made her modeling debut two years ago and now her demand is growing rapidly
 vah fishan brands dolse or gabbana ke liye modelling karti hai
 Ma is one of the senior citizen models in China and the international market
 darasal, senior citigen modells is varg ke upabhoktaaon ko brands kii taraf khinch laane main safal ho rahi hai
 Ma told AFP agency, 'I never go without dressing and make-up
 main kabhi bhi khud ko budhi daadi ke taur par pesh nahin karti hum
 Ma has recently appeared in a show by Uooyaa
 is sho main yuva mahilaon or modells ke alaava seniors ko bhi shaamil kiya gaya tha
 Ma said, the fashion industry is embracing models with white hair and wrinkles but despite this you need to remain stylish and fit
 unhone bataaya ki vah feet rahane ke liye gym main niyamit taur par eksrasij karti hai kyonki acchhee sehat ke saath hi catwalk kiya ja saktaa he
 The demand of senior citizens, once limited to life insurance, is now increasing in glamorous fashion brands
 maa ne kaha, 'yang modells ke baad mujhe 'best for last' ke liye bachaakar rakhaa gaya tha taaki main sho main najar aa sakuun
 'by 2050, one-third of the population in China will be above 60 years of age
 is ayuvarg ke logon kii aamadani zyada he or living standard bhi hai he isliye bazaar main senior citigen modells kii maang bad gai he
 Remember that elections should not be a fight between any two candidates in a constituency
 aapako use pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaaron kii ladaai main tabdeel kar dena he
 Can SP and BSP even think about the post of Prime Minister? But Narendra Modi can become Prime Minister
 jo rupaya bikta he uskaa vyapaar kariye
 Amit Shah said these things at a close-door meeting of party workers in Bareilly on the first day of Navratri last year
 us samay ve uttar pradesh bijepi ke kaaryakari mahasachiv the
 "do business" was an unusual idiom for BJP workers in that Hindi region
 yah ram mandir or hindutv kii anya kahaniyon kii unki rajnatik shabdaawalee se alag tha
 Shah was not unfamiliar with the central ideology of the BJP
 ve nayaa rajnatik brands bana rahe the jo badi karency main tabdeel ho saktaa tha
 The language of this market transaction has made a place in the BJP
 abhootpurv badhotaree karte hue isane bijepi main nai samskruti bana di he jisaki kuch khaas baaten hai or ye haryana tathaa maharashtra ke prachaar main khulkar najar ai hai
 (BJP leader in Maharashtra, Devendra Fadnavis) New willpower Baji: Nothing can be achieved without raising the stakes
 surakshit or vaikalpik rasta apnaane kii bajaae maharashtra or haryana main akele jaakar bijepi ne saaf sandesh diya he ki modi or shah maujuuda badhat ko tab tak kaayam rakhane kii koshish karenge jab tak ve aisa kar sakate hai
 It has cautioned all coalition partners and all ruling regional parties
 sakhti se saudebaaji modi or shah kii jodi is kendriya siddhant ko puri tarah follow karti he
 It is under this that tough decisions are taken which easily prove to be excellent in bargaining
 natijatan shiv sena ke saath 25 saal puraane bhaavnaatmak gathbandhan ke baavjood shah bilkul spasht the ki saudebaaji kis str kii honi chahie
 After the two did not agree, they parted ways without much uproar
 chunaav nateezon ke baad press conference main bhi unka andaaj mastamaula bana rahaa
 When someone asked that senior leader L
W
 ke
 Advani has expressed his desire to re-form an alliance with the Shiv Sena, so Shah said, "we have heard
" ’’brands banaae rakhana haihyahaan aadhaar yah he ki acha pradarshan bijepi ke prime brands narendra modi ko or taqatvar banayega
 In Shah's words, this is the currency that is working
 shah ke mutabik-modi pehle vaadon ke saath chunauti bane or ab ve pradhanmantri ke kuch maah ke kaam se parformar ban gaye hai
 Indirectly there is a market intelligence: a big brand merges a smaller brand into itself
 isliye mukhyamantri ummidavaar ab vidhansabha chunaav main posterboy nahin rahenge
 This is clearly different from the BJP tradition
 boj kam karnajang main jane se pehle vyarth ke maal-asabaab ko apane saath kabhi nahin le janaa chahie
 Shah separated the Kuldeep Bishnoi-led Haryana Janhit Congress from himself in a jolt when he saw that even in the Modi wave, Bishnoi could not win a single seat in the Lok Sabha elections
 yah gathbandhan kareeb do saal pehle nitin gadakari or sushamaa swaraj ne banwaaya tha
 It was then strengthened through signed agreements
 shah ne khud ko isse alag kar liya
 Maintaining Commitment: No project is big or small
 chaahe vah chota rajya haryana ho yaa vishaal maharashtra, hameshaa behtareen sansadhano kaa asardaar tareeke se istemaal karen or waar karen
 So Modi kept 10 days, giving equal time to both the states
 sanghathan ke sabase adhik bharosemand logon ko unke chunavi prabandhan ko asardaar tareeke se aajamaane ke liye bheja gaya
 Om Mathur and Sunil Bansal were sent to Maharashtra and Kailash Vijayvargiya was sent to Haryana
 kendriya mantri jaise radha mohan singh, dharmendra pradhan, santosh gangavar or manoj sinha se saamaanya kaaryakartaaon kii tarah kaam liya gaya or unhen apni nirdhaarit pariyojnaon ke liye sanghathan ke logon kii baton ko sunanaa tha
 Center of power The election of these states has established Modi and Shah as the only centers of power in the BJP
 unki kamyaabi party netaaon or gathbandhan sahyogiyon ko haashiye par rakhegi
 The BJP, which has achieved huge success in Haryana and Maharashtra without cashing in on the local faces, is not in the mood to give a nod to the local ambitious satraps
 isliye jharkhand main arjuna munda or bihar main susheel kumaar modi apni pojishan tay maanakar nahin chal sakate
 As far as coalition partners are concerned, this will also send a message to Ram Vilas Paswan of LJP and Upendra Kushwaha of Rashtriya Lok Samata Party
 donon haal hi main loksabhaa chunaav se pehle bihar main bijepi ke sahyogi bane the
 It is also like a memo for JVM leader Babulal Marandi, who is seeking to bargain hard with the BJP for the assembly elections in Jharkhand
 haalanki punjab main abhi vidhansabha chunaav 2017 main hone hai jo abhi kuch dur he phir bhi vahaan sharton ko lekar tol-mol yaa baatcheet se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Especially after supporting the INLD in Haryana on behalf of the Shiromani Akali Dal
 bijepi ke ek varisht netaa kehete hai, ‘‘pehali baar siton ke bantwaare ke liye mol-tol karne shivasena ko hamane bijepi offis aate dekha
 Earlier we had seen our senior leaders going to Matoshree
 ’’ shivasena ke saath badale samikarnon ke baad bijepi ke party kader main yah gauravshaalee najariya aayaa he
 Clearly, for the first time, the BJP has a leadership that is acting like a high command
 yah udhaaharan bijepi ke nae taur-tareekon ko bakhubi jaahir kar rahaa haih mahasachiv rajeev pratap rudi ko kinare karte hue maharashtra kii kaman vastav main om maathur ko de di gai
 Challenges ahead: bjp's victories in Maharashtra and Haryana mean that it is close to its main political plan, that is, "congress-mukt Bharat"
 yah naaraa loksabhaa chunaav ke pehle or baad main bhi chalaaya jaataa rahaa
 However, the party's next war is against regional parties
 party ke ranneetikaron kaa maananaa he ki isliye ab is naare ko shchalo chalem modi ke sathy main badalakar is maahaul ko sakaaratmak lahar main badal dena chahie
 In Jharkhand and Jammu and Kashmir, BJP insiders say that the corrupt and ineffective Congress will eliminate its regional parties as well
 bijepi yah mauka ganvaana nahin chaahati
 Modi will be shown as the best option
 kshetreey dalon ke saamne sthaneey pahchaan ko majboot karne kii chunauti he
 The Shiv Sena failed, but regional parties may have only one hope to reverse it
 jaisaa maharashtra chunaav ne dikhaaya heru nattejey hameshaa ummiido ke anuroop nahin hote
 Following the business logic that Shah had given his workers in Bareilly, the new BJP would have to cancel a lot of deals, make concessions and share power
 modi-shah kii jodi is ichhashakti ke saath, apni agali pramukh chunauti se kaise nibetagi, dekhnaa dilachasp hoga
 a shameful case of raping a minor girl has come up in Shamli district of Uttar Pradesh

 Additional Superintendent of Police Sunil Kumar Singh said here that a 45-year-old woman from Lonianpurwa village of Ranipur police station area had left for Lucknow yesterday for her treatment

 He said that the dead body of the woman was found hanging from a sari's noose in a garden today

 His mobile phone and slippers were also lying nearby
 singh ne bataaya ki aarope he ki gaanv ke hi paanch logon ne usase samuhik balaatkaar karke uski hatya kar di or shav ped se lataka diya
 On receiving the information, senior officials who reached the spot, took the body from the tree and sent it for postmortem
 unhone bataaya ki paanchon aropiyon ke khilaaf taharir di gayi he
 According to the villagers, the accused used to sell liquor at their groceries, which the woman opposed
 isi baat ko lekar donon pakshon ke bich tanatani rahati thi
 Police has also accepted the matter of enmity
 singh ne balaatkaar kii ashanka se inkaar na karte hue kaha ki postmortem report aane ke baad hi is bare main pakke taur par koi baat kahi ja sakegi
 The matter is under investigation
 centre sarkaar jammu-kashmir sarkaar ko kehane vaali he ki public sefti act kaa vah sahi tareeke se yani 'judysius yuz' kare
 The central government is taking this step keeping in mind the trouble that has been raised about Masrat Alam

 'after the release of Masrat, the government had to hear a lot from the opposition

 bhashaa - ieenes Radhe Maa reaches somewhere later, disputes reach her earlier
 aakhir kyon he radhe maa aisi? kyon radhe maa par dahej ke liye ladki ko sataane se lekar ashleelata failaane or farji sant hone tak ke iljaam lag chuke hai? kyon radhe maa ko aksar ye lagata he ki wo agar jehar khaakar kar apni jaan hi de detii, to acha hota?har aarope par chuppius par paakhandee hone ke ilzaam lage, wo chup rahi
 People called him a thug, he did not say anything
 ghar tudwane kii tohamat lagi, tab bhi uske lab khamosh the
 But now listen first of all, Radhe Maa's pain on Aaj Tak and her past
 uski zindagi ke har pahalu
 
 har raaj
 
 sasuraal se lekar maayke tak
 
 dilli lekar mumbai tak
 
 jaaniye babbo se lekar bhagwaan banane tak kii puri kahani
 When Aaj Tak came on Aaj Tak's camera, he said to Aaj Tak, "I am not the incarnation of Durga
" meraa trishul meraa dharm he
 i believe in humanity
 nahin badaluungi apana style
 Whoever says fake, he will pay
 meri koi gupt gupha nahin he
 i wanted to eat poison
 mere upar lage aarope jhuthe hai
 'but Aaj Tak's conversation with Radhe Ma was just the beginning
 ajtak ke camere ke saamne radhe maa ne apane saare raaj khol die
 Sometimes he laughed
 kabhi roi
 At one time, he was silent and finally ran away with anger
 vivaadon se purana nathadrasal, pichley chand saalon main radhe maa kaa naam itane saare vivaadon se judaa ki ginanevaale bhi thak jaaen
 These controversies of Radhe Maa range from spreading obscenity, torture for dowry, abetment to suicide, as well as the controversy over the murder of his master
 ye or baat he ki radhe maa in tamaam vivaadon ke liye khud se jalane waalon ko zimmedaar maanati he
 Radhe Manvo, changing color every moment, sometimes becomes a goddess doing hymns and kirtans, and sometimes a baby in the fashion world
 magar radhe maa kii shakhsiyat ke sirf yahi do pahalu nahin he
 Rather Radhe Maa does so much more, which no other girl can even think of doing
 or tabhi radhe maa ko lekar ek vivaad khatm hota nahin ki doosraa shuru ho jaataa he
 And these controversies of Radhe Maa and the charges leveled against Radhe Maa, ranging from minor and petty allegations to such serious crimes, make it difficult to believe even by listening
 dahej utpeedan kaa aaropradhe maa par ye aarope bhi kisi gair ne nahin, balki radhe maa ko chaahane vaale ek parivaar kii bahu ne hi lagaae the
 This girl had written a report against Radhe Maa in Kandivali police station in Mumbai
 ladki ne bataaya tha ki radhe maa ne ladke waalon ko 25 lakh rupye dahej maangane ke liye uksaaya
 He demanded a helicopter and expensive car to attend the wedding, and after the marriage was not fulfilled, the process of persecution started on him
 is maamle main police ne radhe maa se poochtacha bhi kii or unhen hajiri dene thana bhi janaa padaa tha
 Her film and TV actress Dolly Bindra, who was a devotee of sexual harassment, also made serious allegations against Radhe Maa
 doli bindra ne kaha tha ki radhe maa ke darbar main uskaa yon shoshan kiya gaya
 Dolly had also filed a police complaint against Radhe Maa and the police had also filed a case on Radhe Maa for spreading obscenity
 apane hi guru kaa murderyahi nahin, radhe maa par apane guru mahant ramadhin das paramhans kii hatya kii sajeesh kaa aarope bhi laga
 The allegations were not made by anyone but his mentor brother Mahant Shyam Sundar Das
 kangra ke ashram main rahane vaale shyaam sundar das ne kaha tha ki radhe maa ne ye saazish darasal, guruji kii daulat hasil karne ke liye rachi thi
 Another controversy ensued in 2012 in connection with the controversy over Mahamandaleshwar's fictional saint Takaradeh Maa, when the saint's Juna Akhada gave him the title of Mahamandaleshwar in a hurry
 bavaal badha to ye oopaadhi waapas le lee gai
 It was alleged that Radhe Ma had also offered to pay huge amount to get the title of Mahamandaleshwar
 lekin ab to baat or bad gai he
 The Akhil Bhartiya Akhara Parishad has called Radhe Maa a fake saint
 tantra-mantra or kaala jaadooradhe maa par tantra-mantra or kaale jaadu ke jariye kai logon ko thagne auki pareshaan karne ke aarope bhi lage
 It is said that Radhe Maa, who calls herself an avatar of Goddess, is also expert in witchcraft and tantra-mantra
 radhe maa par ek iljaam ye bhi laga ki kaale jaadu or tantra mantra ke jariye usne logon ko fansaaya or suicide tak ke liye uksaaya tha
 Accused of abetting suicide, Radhe Maa was also accused of abetting the suicide of 5 people from a family in Kutch, Gujarat
 kaha ja rahaa he ki khudakushi karne vaale parivaar ke logon ne radhe maa ko is bharose main apni sari jaaydaad daan kar di ki unki jindagi main khushhaali aegi
 But if nothing happened, then in desperation, they committed suicide
 haalanki radhe maa shuru se kaale jaadu or tantra mantra ke aaropon se inkaar karti hai
 But the truth is that there is no dearth of controversies and accusations about Radhe Maa

 ek baras kaa intjaar puraa hua or jald hi dhooma much jaaegi salanaa ganeshotsav kii
 Legendary belief is that Lord Shiva and Parvati's son Ganesha live on earth during this ten-day festival
 shastron main dilchaspee rakhane vaale acharya aakhyaanand kehete hai ki bhagwaan ganesh ko vighnaharta kaha jaataa he
 He is worshiped as a god of wisdom, prosperity and splendor
 ganeshotsav kii shuruyaat hindu calendar ke anusaar, bhadon maah main shukla chaturthi se hoti he
 This day is called Ganesh Chaturthi
 das din tak ganpati puja ke baad aati he anant chaturdashi jis din yah utsav samaapt hota he
 across India

 Retired Professor of History Prof UG Gupta said, 'in 1893, Tilak declared that the God Ganesha is the deity of all, to bridge the distance between Brahmins and non-brahmins
 isi uddeshy se unhone ganeshotsav ke saarvajanik aayojan kiye or dekhte hi dekhte maharashtra main hui yah shuruyaat desh bhar main fail gai
 This effort proved to be an example of unity
 ’pro gupta ne kaha ki ekta kaa yah shankhanaad maharashtra vaasiyon ko british aupniveshik shashan ke khilaaf ekajute karne main behad kargar sabit hua
 Tilak encouraged the installation of large statues of Ganesha in the pavilions

 Prof Amia Ganguly, who has a keen interest in history, said, 'the British were always against social and political events
 lekin ganeshotsav ke dauraan har varg ke log ekatrit hote or tarah-tarah kii yojanaayen banaai jaatin
 The festival played an important role in awakening independence
 ’ganeshotsav kaa silsilaa abhi bhi jari he or isaki taiyaariyaan maheenon pehle se shuru ho jaati hai
 While the sculptors make attractive sculptures of Vighnaharta, the organizers collect donations and set up the pavilion
 murtiyon kaa aakaar or unki keemat dinon din badhati gai or saath hi badhata gaya is utsav ke prati logon kaa utsaah
 Pandit Akhyananda says, 'in the pavilion decorated with lights, various tableaux, flower garlands, on the day of Ganesh Chaturthi, worship is done, Ganapati is established after the chanting
 yah rasm shodashopchaar kehalaati he
 Flowers and leaves are offered to the Lord and coconut, khand, 21 modak are offered
 das din tak ganpati virajman rahete hai or har din subah shaam shodashopchaar kii rasm hoti he
 After worship on the 11th day, the idol is taken for immersion
