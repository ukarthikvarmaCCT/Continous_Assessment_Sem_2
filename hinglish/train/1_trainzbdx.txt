 lekin kya ve donon ho paaenge safal
 
 
 Pragya can do anything for now
 abhi ke liye bhale hi use apni jaan hi kyon na gavaani pade vah hichakegi bhi nahin
 
 
 That's why she has reached the base of the goons by playing on her life
 jahaan gundon ne abhi ko kaidi bana kar rakhaa hua he
 Pragya has reached there after playing on her life, but the thing to be seen today will be whether she will be able to take her out safely from there or both will get caught in the clutches of the goons
 
 
 5 june ke episod main pragna chhipate-chhipate vahaan pahunch to gai he, lekin use abhi ko aaazaad karne kaa mauka nahin mila
 Pragya is confused as to how she can open the rope of her arms and legs to liberate her now
 
 
 lekin isi bich damru ko is baat kaa shaq ho jaataa he ki abhi ke alaava vahaan koi or bhi he
 When Damru goes to see that there is no one else there, Pragya cleverly exits the room

 Pragya enters the room once again, but Abhi Fan, one of the goons, takes a selfie with her, with Pragya hiding behind her
 abhi chaalaaki se us tasviir ko delit karne ko kahata he
 After the goons leave, Pragya asks Pragya to leave
 pragna abhi ko bhaagane kaa plan bataati he
 Pragya makes a map to tell her how many goons are present at this place and how they have to get out of there
 
 
 lekin dekhne vaali baat yah hogi ki kya pragna abhi ko aaazaad kara paaegi yaa phir donon hi vahaan funs jaaenge

 The Indian team has already reached the semi-finals, but captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni termed the match against Pakistan in the ICC Champions Trophy on Saturday as important, but added that the team would not take any extra pressure
 dhoni ne match kii purv sandhya par kaha, main samajhataa hum ki yah mahatvapurn match he
 This is a very important match
 yah myne nahin rakhata ki aap kis team ke khilaaf khel rahe hai, kyonki sabhi antarrashtriya timen bahut acchhee hai, isliye atirikt dabaav lene kaa koi matlab nahin banataa
 Describing the matches between India and Pakistan as big matches, Dhoni said that taking additional pressure would be fatal
 unhone kaha, sabhi antarrashtriya timen acchhee hai or unke paas kai tej gendbaaj hai
 Pakistan also have good spinners in the form of Saeed Ajmal and Mohammad Hafeez
 ham apana ravaiya nahin badalenge
 Dhoni also mentioned India's strong batting before this much-awaited match
 unhone kaha, hamen har samay salaami ballebaajon se shatkeey saajhedaari kii jarurat nahin he
 Our team is one that relies on a good start, but that does not mean that we will always need a century partnership
 hamaare salaami ballebaajon or anya ballebaajon ko krij par kuch samay gujaarne kii jarurat he
 Rohit Sharma and Shikhar Dhawan have given India a good start in two matches so far
 edbeston ke upar badal chhaae rahane ke kaaran bhartiya team ko edbeston cricket centre ke indor main abhyaas karne ke liye majaboor hona padaa
 Dhoni feels that the toss can play an important role in Saturday's match
 tippaniyan He said, we need to see if the match will be affected due to rain, as the team playing later can only get 20 or 25 overs to bat
 aise main pehle khilne vaali team thodaa nuksaan main rahegi
 Dhoni was asked that Pakistan is taking this match as a final, he said, it can be seen in two ways
 yadi ve soch rahe hai ki unke paas ganvaane ke liye kuch bhi nahin he, maidan par utaro or apana sarvshereshth pradarshan karo or parinaam kii chintaa mat karo, to phir ve khatarnaak ho sakate hai
 He said, but if they are thinking that they have not qualified and this match is against India and we have to win it, then we can be in trouble again
 isliye yah puri tarah se pakistan kii soch par nirbhar karata he
 Dhoni said on the eve of the match, i think it is an important match
 yah bahut mahatvapurn match he
 It doesn't matter which team you're playing against, because all international teams are very good, so it doesn't make sense to take extra pressure
 bharat or pakistan ke maichon ko bada match qaraar dete hue dhoni ne kaha ki atirikt dabaav lenaa ghaatak hoga
 He said, all international teams are good and they have many fast bowlers
 pakistan ke paas said ajmal or mohammad hafeez ke rup main achche spinner bhi hai
 We will not change our attitude
 dhoni ne is bahu-pratikshit match se pehle bharat kii majboot ballebaaji kaa bhi zikr kiya
 "we don't need a century partnership with the openers all the time," he said
 hamaari team aisi he, jo acchhee shuruyaat par nirbhar karti he, lekin iskaa matlab yah nahin he ki hamen hameshaa shatkeey saajhedaari kii jarurat rahegi
 Our openers and other batsmen need to spend some time at the crease
 bharat ko rohit sharma or shikhar dhawan ne ab tak do maichon main acchhee shuruyaat dilaai he
 Due to cloudy over Edgbaston, the Indian team was forced to practice at the Edgbaston Cricket Center indoor
 dhoni ko lagata he ki shanivaar ke match main toss ahm bhoomika nibhaa saktaa he
 The comments unhone kaha, hamen yah dekhne kii jarurat he ki kya barish ke kaaran match zyada prabhavit hoga, kyonki baad main khilne vaali team ko 20 yaa 25 over hi ballebaaji ke liye mil sakate hai
 In this case, the team playing first will be at a slight disadvantage
 dhoni se poocha gaya ki pakistan is match ko final ke rup main le rahaa he, unhone kaha, ise do tarah se dekha ja saktaa he
 If they are thinking they have nothing to lose, get on the field and do their best and don't worry about the results, then they can be dangerous
 unhone kaha, lekin yadi ve soch rahe hai ki unhone kwalifai nahin kiya he or yah match bharat ke khilaaf he or hamen ise har haal main jeetna he, to phir se sankat main pad sakate hai
 So it depends entirely on the thinking of Pakistan

 "kamal Khan has thus taunted the Indian team, citing Ambati Rayudu's tweet

 He had earlier written that this team would not even reach the semi-finals

 Before the fifth anniversary of its establishment, the signs of discord are once again visible in the Aam Aadmi Party
 party ke andar ek bada tufaan khadaa hone kaa intjaar kar rahaa he jisaki sharuaat hui aam aadmi party dwaara vidhayak amanatulla khan kaa nilamban radd karne se, jinhen party ke bade netaa kumaar vishwaas par bijepi ke saath santh-ganth ke aarope ke baad party kii praathmik sadsyta se nilambit kar diya gaya tha
 On Sunday, a three-member committee of the party formed under the leadership of AAP leader Ashutosh sent its recommendation on the suspension of Amanatullah to the party, which called for the suspension of Amanatullah Khan
 sutara bataa rahe hai ki party kii sarvocch ikai piesi ke zyaadaatar sadasyon ne amanatulla ke nilamban par samiti kii raay se sahmati dikhaai or bahumat kii raay parkumar par avishvasadikhane vaale vidhayak amanatulla kaa nilamban radd ho gaya
 But the timing of this incident is more interesting than this because on November 2, the Aam Aadmi Party has called its first proposed meeting of this year and the fifth National Council of the party i
e
 the National Council
 lagbhag 450 se zyada sadasyon vaali party kii sabase badi ikai do din baad desh ke jwalanth muddon par charchaa kar prastaav paas karegi saath hi duusare rajyon main party ke vistaar, chunaav ladane or sanghathan par bhi charchaa karegi
 Angry over the suspension of Amanatullah, Kumar Vishwas says that his name is not included as a speaker in the party's national council meeting, which is the first time in five years
 lekin ajtak se baatcheet main vishwaas ne saaf- saaf kaha he ki agar party ke kaaryakarta chahenge to wo parishad ke bheetar apni baat jarur karenge or jarurat padi to baahar bhi baat karenge
 Distrust of Kumar within Aam Aadmi Party is not new
 amanataullah khandwara lagaae aaropon par party ke kisi bade netaa ne khul kar kumaar kaa saath nahin diya tha
 However, during the Man Manawaval period, the head of the party and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had reached the house of Vishwas himself at midnight to celebrate him
 maamla amanatulla ke nilamban par khatm hua or kumaar ko party ne rajasthan kii kaman saunp di
 But if you believe the sources, the root of the dispute is the party leaders' ambition to go to Rajya Sabha
 farvari main aam aadmi party ko dilli main 3 rajyasabha siten milani hai or ye mana ja rahaa tha ki kejariwal apane kareebi sanjay singh, kumaar vishwaas or ashutosh ko rajyasabha bhejenge
 Party leader Kumar Vishwas Gahe Bahega openly expressed his ambition to go to the Rajya Sabha on several occasions, but as per sources, the party has not yet assured him of Rajya Sabha in a formal manner or by gestures
 itnaa hi kumaar vishwaas kii party ke kai netaaon se khatas punjab vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan hi shuru ho gai thi kyonki vivaadon se bachane ke liye vishwaas ko punjab chunaavon main prachaar se dur rakhaa gaya
 Sources close to Kumar Vishwas attribute this to the then in-charge of Punjab, Sanjay Singh and Durgesh Pathak
 khatas badhati gai jiskaa asar dilli ke nagar nigam chunaavon main bhi dekhne ko mila jahaan vishwaas party ke prachaar se gaayab dikhe
 Meanwhile, Okhla MLA Amanatullah Khan of the party accused Kumar Vishwas of colluding with the BJP
 ruthe kumaar ke ghar party ke vidhayakon kaa aana janaa shuru hua jisase aise sanket mili ki party ke vidhayak kii ek sankhya kumaar vishwaas ke saath khadi he
 Apparently any such indication could have been difficult for the party
 amanatulla ke bayaan or vishwaas kii naaraazgi ke us episod main kumaar ke sabase najdiki dikhe party ke vidhayak or tatkaaleen dilli sarkaar main mantri kapil mishra jinhen baad main kejariwal mantrimandal se baahar kaa rasta dikhaa diya gaya
 Everyone knows what Kapil Mishra did and said when he was out of government
 amanatulla ke nilamban par radd hone ke sawaal par ajtak se baatcheet karte hue kumaar vishwaas ne aarope lagaaya he ki party ke kuch netaa unke back tu basis mudde se khafa hai or isliye unke khilaaf shadyantra kar rahe hai
 Vishwas says that he is acting as a bitter drug of neem for the party
 ishaaron- ishaaron main unhone ek baar phir kisi samay apane sabase kareebi rahe netaa sanjay singh par aarope lagaate hue kah diya ki party ne uttar pradesh ke nikaay chunaavon main congress bijepi kii tarah parivaar ko nibhaate hue kisi padaadhikari ke parivaar ke sadsy ko tikat diya he
 If sources are to be believed, the party leaders are angry with the recent statements made by Vishwas to the media and they say that this is sending the wrong message to the party workers
 amanatulla ke nilamban par ajtak se baatcheet karte hue kumaar vishwaas ne mayank gandhi, yogendra yadav or anjali damania ko party se nikaale jane kaa zikr karte hue ishaaron main ye aarope lagaaya ki unke khilaaf bhi sajeesh kii ja rahi he
 After losing one election after another, the Aam Aadmi Party and Arvind Kejriwal changed their tactics and kept silence
 party ko laga ki piem modi ke khilaaf lagaataar sidhe- sidhe hamalon se party ko nuksaan hua jiske baad arvind kejariwal ne jo chuppi sadhi vah aaj tak dikh rahi he
 The Aam Aadmi Party changed its strategy and focused its attention on the states where BJP or Congress is the only government and there is room for a third party
 aam aadmi party madhya pradesh chhattisgarh or rajasthan main agle saal hone vaale vidhansabha chunaav ke liye bhoomika bana rahi he saath hi party ke liye kin rajyon main maahaul khadaa karne kii koshish kar rahi he, lekin in tamaam koshishon ke bich party netaaon ke bich kumaar ko lekar umada avishvaas party ke bheetar ek or tufaan uthne kii ore ishaara kar rahaa he
 It will be seen what will be the stand of Kejriwal and party leaders in the National Council meeting to be held on November 2

 According to information received from sources, this time the tableau proposed by the Kerala government on the theme of 'renaissance' will not be included in the Republic Day parade
 kerala sarkaar ne is baar 26 janvari ke kaarykram main 'vykom satyagrah' or 'mandir pravesh kii ghoshnaa' ko pradarshit karti jhaanki kaa prastaav kiya tha
 However, there is no formal response from the Ministry of Defense in this matter, as the selection process is still in the final stages
 gauratlab he ki har saal ganatantr diwas parade main 19 se 21 jhaankiyaan shaamil hoti hai
 But in the last list of this year, 20 tableaux have got place, out of which 14 tableaux will be from different states and 6 tableaux will be from the Union Territory and Central Government

 Therefore, Ame may once again raise political controversy due to the non-selection of tableau to showcase the Kerala government's temple entry
 kya tha vykom satyagrah?vykom satyagrah kerala ke traavncor ke vykom main 1924 main shuru hua tha
 The purpose of which was to convince the untouchables of their rights about entry into Hindu temples and use of public roads in Gandhian way

 On 30 March 1924, a party of the Kerala Congress, consisting of upper castes and lower castes, tried to enter the temple

 @jacquelinef143 here I'm, as promised!a post shared by Sidharth Malhotra (@s1dofficial) on Jun 5, 2017 at 11:40am PDT bjp's firebrand leader Uma Bharti has again targeted Priyanka Vadra, the star campaigner of the Congress
 unhone kaha ki priyanka ke pati robert wadra ke jameen saudon kii jaanch hogi or damaad ji jail jaaenge
 In 'aaj Tak' program 'sidhi Baat', Uma Bharti said, 'we will not work with a sense of revenge but the land deals will be investigated

 Uma said, 'modi gave good governance in Gujarat
 gujarat ke vikaas ne modi par meri bhi raay badal di
 Modi's name echoed everywhere during the election campaign
 modi kii lokapriyata kaa andaja hi nahin tha
 The BJP leader said that there is a big difference between US President Barack Obama and Narendra Modi
 unhone kaha, 'obama keval bol kar janata ko prabhavit karte hai jabaki modi ne apane kaam se logon ko prabhavit kiya he
 Modi has not done false marketing

 There has been a lot of development in the BJP ruled states

 srilanka malaria se mukt ho gaya he
 The declaration of malaria-free Sri Lanka is important, not historical, because many countries of the world have been liberated from malaria and around 90 countries are trying to get rid of or control in the name of liberation
 malaria se srilanka kii mukti par baat honi chahie kyonki machharon se ham bhi to pareshaan hai
 Many times you may wonder why we do not talk on such topics
 aaj jo mushkil ai wo bataanaa chahta hum
 In our eyes, the whole day passed by contacting all the people whose names came up
 jinhone shandaar kaam kiye hai wo america chale gaye
 Some of those who were in India did not know Hindi
 jinhen hindi aati thi unhone duusare kaa naam bataaya to duusare ne tisare kaa
 It is risky to reach people who have worked in remote areas of India through Skype
 to itnaa aasaan nahin he ki aap hindi main malaria par jab chahen baat kar len
 i am telling you that just by wanting nothing does not happen
 phir bhi aaj malaria par baat karke rahoonga
 a tragic news of death from malaria has come to light in India's capital Delhi
 praveen sharma 4 agast ke rose safadarajang aspataal main bhartee hua lekin batch nahin sakaa
 It has been said throughout the day that this is the first death from malaria in Delhi in the last five years
 phir pataa chalaa ki isi july main ek or maut ho chuki he
 You can understand how the data of remote areas would be recorded
 praveen ke bhai rajan sharma kaa kahana he ki 28 taarikh ko maiks patpadganj main malaria kaa pataa chalaa tha
 On 3 August, Safdarjung was referred to where the condition deteriorated
 malaria se maut par ham kyon chaukanne hue
 Even after having all the modern facilities from investigation to treatment, if anyone dies from this disease, then our ears should stand up
 sarkari aankada he ki is saal july tak bharat main kareeb 4 lakh 71 hazaar malaria ke maamle report hue hai
 119 people have died
 bharat main jane kab se malaria se mukti ke prayaas chal rahe hai
 There is a department and staff are deployed and there is a budget
 akele dilli main teenon nigamon main chaar hazaar karmchaaree iske liye tainaat kiye gaye hai
 Their work is to get rid of malaria, dengue and chikungunya
 kul milakar 78 karod kaa salanaa bajet he
 If you add the resources of all the corporations of the country, then you will know how many people are behind the mosquitoes
 machharon se mukti kaa abhiyaan sarkaar bhi samay samay par chalaati he jin par ham samay samay par dhyaan nahin dete hai
 Mosquitoes themselves create conditions and by buying cream and coils from the market, understand what the mosquito will spoil us
 sochiye ye machhar jab bharat sarkaar se nahin daraa to aapke quayal se daregaa
 Due to these, all kinds of diseases are spreading across the country, yet we are not spreading
 saamaanya hote ja rahe hai
 How Sri Lanka achieved freedom from malaria
 pehle is katha ko suniye phir baat karenge ki bharat main kya dikkatein hai
 How far have we been successful
 hamaare sahyogi parimal ne bataaya ki bharat ko malaria mukt hone main 2030 tak kaa vakt lag jayega
 i do not know when i will get rid of dengue and chikungunya
 aaj se saath saal pehle srilanka puri duniya main malaria se sabase adhik prabhavit mana jaataa tha
 There has not been a single malaria patient in Sri Lanka in the last three and a half years
 srilanka ne 1911 main anti malaria campan shuru kiya tha, us dauraan har saal malaria ke 15 lakh maamle darj hua karte the
 Sri Lanka had almost eliminated malaria by 1963 when there were only 17 case reports
 tab srilanka ne iskaa bajet kahin or khapa diya
 And the mosquitoes started returning again
 phir se pachaas saal lag gaye malaria mukt hone main
 Sri Lanka receives four times more rainfall than India
 vishwa swasthya sanghathan (WHO) ke mutabik nabbe ke dashak main srilanka ne malaria se nipatane kii ranneeti badali
 In addition to mosquitoes, parasites of parasitic malaria were also targeted
 aam jubaan main ham samajhe ki ham machharon ko bhagane ke liye phoging karne lagate hai
 But targeting the parasite means eliminating the malaria elements within the mosquito
 srilanka ne malaria se nipatane ke liye internet kaa istamaal kiya
 Every type of fever patient was also tested for malaria and every case was notified to the anti-malaria Campaign of the Ministry of Health
 iskaa ek rashtriya data taiyaar kiya gaya
 Those traveling in malaria-affected countries were identified
 un par nigaraanee rakhi gai
 Army personnel who went to other countries on peace missions were also tested
 malaria kii davaaiyaan sirf anti malaria campan ke paas hi maujuud thi, iske kaaran majabuuran privet health centre ko bhi bataanaa padaa ki unke yahaan malaria kaa mariz he
 The Anti Malaria Campaign ran a 24-hour hotline
 beemaari ko failane se bachaane ke liye marizon kaa alag se ilaj kiya
 The Sri Lankan cabinet has decided that the Malaria Liberation Campaign will get and get ten percent more budget every year
 is puure maamle main do shabdon kaa zikr aayega
 Vector and Parasite
 vector kaa matlab jo vaahak hota he
 Which carries vector kaa matlab machhar hua
 Female Anopheles mosquito
 parasite plasmodium is machhar ke andar hota he or jab machhar katata he to wo parasite insaan main jaakar malaria jaisi beemaari ko janm detaa he
 The Sri Lankan expedition thought of curing this Palasmodium parasite
 yani is par atake kiya
 From 1999 onwards, malaria patients started declining rapidly and till 2008 only 1000 cases were reported every year
 sadakon kii safai par khaas dhyaan rakhaa gaya
 Water was not allowed to accumulate so that mosquitoes do not thrive
 gramin ilaakon main ilaaj muhaiyaa karaane ke liye mobile malaria clinics banaae gaye
 India likewise got rid of polio
 polio mukti abhiyaan bhi kam shandaar nahin he
 Sometimes you will take time to read the details of this campaign and then you will know how at any given time someone comes to your door with polio medicine
 ek aise mausam main jab bharat main log dengue chikangunia se karaah rahe hai, srilanka se malaria mukti kii yah khabar hamaare bheetar bhi sapanom ko jagaati he
 So let's talk
 puri duniya main 320 karod log malaria ke khatre ke bich rahete hai
 Liberation campaigns are going on all over the world
 2015 main malaria se duniya bhar main 4 lakh logon kii maut hui he
 There have been 21 crore malaria cases
 tippaniyan There are many countries like United Arab Emirates, Morocco, Maldives, Armenia, Turkmenistan which have got rid of malaria in the last seven to eight years
 WHO kaa target he ki 2030 tak 35 deshon ko malaria free karne kaa
 Which also includes India and Indonesia
 WHO kaa kahana he ki agle 15 saal tak fundig ko tiguna karnaa padegaa agar ye target puraa karnaa chaahate hai to
 The Government of India has also set a target of eradicating malaria by 2030 in February this year
 us dauraan hyderabad ke freelans patrkaar vivekanand nemana or unke saath logon ke paise se chalane vaale WNYC radio ke liye kaam karne vaali patrkaar ankitha raav ne hindu or aljazira dot kaam ke liye lanbaa or pathneey lekh likhaa he
 This research of both was funded by the readers
 aap darshakon ke fund se ab bahut si website chal rahi hai jahaan news channelon se acha kaam ho rahaa he
 However, Vivekananda and Ankita have done an in-depth study of all the data related to the eradication of malaria in India and in 2014, 90% of the malaria control budget was spent in administrative work
 dawa, machharadaani or chhidkaav ke liye 10 pratishat hi bajet bachaa
 While the disease is causing a loss of about Rs 13000 crore to India's economy every year
 adivasee ilaakon main malaria kaa bhayanak aatank he
 Vivekananda and Ankita Rao say that no one knows exactly how many deaths from malaria occur every year
 2015 main malaria se marane waalon kaa sarkari aankada 300 he jabaki britain kaa pratishthit health jarnal lanset kaa anumaan he ki bharat main har saal 50,000 log malaria se mar jate hai
 There is no concrete evidence that every malaria death is reported
 bahut log aspataal pahunchane se pehle hi bukhaar se mar jate hai
 The two authors also pointed out that the goal of distributing the mosquito nets containing the medicine was that 25K roads would be distributed among the people but not even one percent were distributed among the people
 donon ke lekh main is baat par jor diya gaya he ki malaria se mukti par jor hona chahie
 This is an urgent matter but nothing will be achieved by mere announcement
 bharat kii rajdhani dilli main malaria se maut kii ek dukhad khabar saamne ai he
 Praveen Sharma was admitted to Safdarjung Hospital on 4 August but could not survive
 din bhar bataaya jaataa rahaa ki dilli main pichley paanch saalon main malaria se yah pehali maut he
 Then it was learned that another death had taken place in this July itself
 doordaraj ke ilaakon kaa data kis haal main darj hota hoga aap samaj sakate hai
 Praveen's brother Rajan Sharma says that malaria was detected in Max Patparganj on 28th
 haalat bigadi to 3 agast ko safadarajang refer kar diya gaya jahaan uski maut ho gai
 Why are we alert to death from malaria jaanch se lekar ilaaj kii tamaam aadhunik suvidha hone ke baad bhi koi is beemaari se mar jaae to hamaare kaan khadey ho jane chahie
 The official data is that till July this year, there have been about 4 lakh 71 thousand malaria cases reported in India
 119 logon kii maut hui he
 Efforts to get rid of malaria have been going on in India since long
 baqayada vibhaag he or karmchaaree tainaat hai or bajet bhi he
 In Delhi alone, four thousand employees have been deployed for this in all three corporations
 inkaa kaam malaria, dengue or chikangunia se mukti dilaanaa he
 There is an annual budget of 78 crores in total
 desh ke tamaam nigamon ke sansaadhan ko jod len to pataa chalegaa ki machharon ke peeche kitne log lage hai
 The government also runs a campaign to rid mosquitoes from time to time, on which we do not pay attention from time to time
 khud bhi machhar paidaa karne ke halaat paidaa karte hai or bazaar se kriim or quayal kharid kar samajhate hai ki machhar hamaara kya bigaad legaa
 Think when this mosquito does not scare the Indian government, it will scare you with your coil
 inke kaaran desh bhar main tamaam tarah kii bimaariyaan fail rahi hai phir bhi ham nahin fail rahe hai
 Are becoming common
 srilanka ne malaria se mukti kaise hasil kii
 First listen to this story and then talk about what are the problems in India
 ham kahaan tak safal hue hai
 Our colleague Parimal said that it will take up to 2030 for India to become malaria free
 dengue or chikangunia se mukti kab milegi pataa nahin
 Sixty years ago, Sri Lanka was considered the most affected by malaria in the world
 pichley saadhe teen saal main srilanka main ek bhi malaria kaa mariz nahin hua he
 Sri Lanka started an anti-malarial campaign in 1911, during which 1
5 million cases of malaria were reported every year
 srilanka ne 1963 tak malaria ko kareeb kareeb khatm hi kar diya tha jab sirf 17 cese report hue
 Then Sri Lanka spent its budget elsewhere
 or machhar phir se lautne lage
 Again it took fifty years to become malaria free
 srilanka main bharat se chaar guna zyaada barish hoti he
 According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Sri Lanka changed its strategy to combat malaria in the nineties
 isamen machhar ke alaava malaria ke parasite yani paraseete ko bhi nishaanaa banaaya gaya
 In the common tongue, we understood that we start fogging to ward off mosquitoes
 lekin parasite ko nishaanaa banane kaa matlab he machhar ke bheetar jo malaria ke tatv hai unhen khatm karnaa
 Sri Lanka used the Internet to combat malaria
 har tarah ke bukhaar ke mariz kaa malaria ke liye bhi test kiya gaya or har cese swasthy mantralay ke anti malaria muhim ko notiphoi kiya gaya
 a national data of this was prepared
 malaria grasit mulkon main yatra karne waalon kii pahchaan kii gai
 They were monitored
 shanti mishan par duusare mulkon par gaye sena ke logon kaa bhi test kiya gaya
 Malaria medicines were only available with the anti-malarial campaign, due to which the private health center was also forced to tell that they had malaria patients here
 anti malaria campan ne 24 ghante kii ek hotline chalaai
 Treat patients separately to prevent the spread of the disease
 srilanka cabinet kaa faisla he ki malaria mukti abhiyaan ko har saal das fisadi adhik bajet milegaa or miltaa he
 In this whole case, two words will be mentioned
 vector or parasite
 Vector means the carrier
 jo dhota he
 Vector means mosquito
 femail anophyles machhar
 The parasite Plasmodium is inside this mosquito and when the mosquito bites, the parasite enters the human and gives rise to malaria-like disease
 srilanka ke abhiyaan ne is palasmodium parasite kaa ilaaj karne kaa sochaa
 That is, attacked it
 1999 ke baad se malaria ke marizon main tezi se giravat aane lagi or 2008 tak to har saal sirf 1000 cese hi report hote rahe
 Special attention was paid to cleanliness of the roads
 pani jamaa nahin hone diya gaya taaki machhar na panpen
 Mobile malaria clinics were created to provide treatment in rural areas
 bharat ne bhi isi tarah polio se mukti paa lee thi
 The polio liberation campaign is no less spectacular
 kabhi vakt nikaalkar is abhiyaan kii detail padhiyegaa phir pataa chalegaa ki kaise ek niyat samay par polio kii dawa lekar koi aapke darvaaze par aakar khadaa ho jaataa he
 In a season when people in India are moaning with dengue chikungunya, this news of malaria liberation from Sri Lanka arouses dreams even within us
 to sochaa ki baat karte hai
 All over the world, 320 crore people live amidst the threat of malaria
 puri duniya main mukti abhiyaan chal rahe hai
 In 2015, malaria has killed 4 lakh people worldwide
 21 karod malaria ke maamle saamne aae hai
 The comments sanyukt arab emirate, morocco, maldive, arminiya, turkmenistan jaise kai desh hai jinhone pichley saat aath saalon main malaria se mukti pai he
 WHO aims to make 35 countries malaria free by 2030
 jisamen bharat or indonesia bhi shaamil hai
 The WHO says that funding will have to triple for the next 15 years if they want to meet the target
 bharat sarkaar ne bhi is saal farvari main 2030 tak malaria se mukti kaa lakshya liya he
 During that time, Hyderabad-based freelance journalist Vivekananda Nemana and journalist Ankita Rao, who worked for WNYC Radio running with people's money, wrote a long and readable article for Hindu and Aljazeera

 Only 10 percent budget was left for medicine, mosquito nets and spraying

 The official figure for malaria deaths in 2015 is 300, while the uk's prestigious health journal Lancet estimates that 50,000 people die from malaria every year in India

 If you add the resources of all the corporations of the country, then you will know how many people are behind the mosquitoes
 machharon se mukti kaa abhiyaan sarkaar bhi samay samay par chalaati he jin par ham samay samay par dhyaan nahin dete hai
 Mosquitoes themselves create conditions and by buying cream and coils from the market, understand what the mosquito will spoil us
 sochiye ye machhar jab bharat sarkaar se nahin daraa to aapke quayal se daregaa
 Due to these, all kinds of diseases are spreading across the country, yet we are not spreading
 saamaanya hote ja rahe hai
 How Sri Lanka achieved freedom from malaria
 pehle is katha ko suniye phir baat karenge ki bharat main kya dikkatein hai
 How far have we been successful
 hamaare sahyogi parimal ne bataaya ki bharat ko malaria mukt hone main 2030 tak kaa vakt lag jayega
 i do not know when i will get rid of dengue and chikungunya
 aaj se saath saal pehle srilanka puri duniya main malaria se sabase adhik prabhavit mana jaataa tha
 There has not been a single malaria patient in Sri Lanka in the last three and a half years
 srilanka ne 1911 main anti malaria campan shuru kiya tha, us dauraan har saal malaria ke 15 lakh maamle darj hua karte the
 Sri Lanka had almost eliminated malaria by 1963 when there were only 17 case reports
 tab srilanka ne iskaa bajet kahin or khapa diya
 And the mosquitoes started returning again
 phir se pachaas saal lag gaye malaria mukt hone main
 Sri Lanka receives four times more rainfall than India
 vishwa swasthya sanghathan (WHO) ke mutabik nabbe ke dashak main srilanka ne malaria se nipatane kii ranneeti badali
 In addition to mosquitoes, parasites of parasitic malaria were also targeted
 aam jubaan main ham samajhe ki ham machharon ko bhagane ke liye phoging karne lagate hai
 But targeting the parasite means eliminating the malaria elements within the mosquito
 srilanka ne malaria se nipatane ke liye internet kaa istamaal kiya
 Every type of fever patient was also tested for malaria and every case was notified to the anti-malaria Campaign of the Ministry of Health
 iskaa ek rashtriya data taiyaar kiya gaya
 Those traveling in malaria-affected countries were identified
 un par nigaraanee rakhi gai
 Army personnel who went to other countries on peace missions were also tested
 malaria kii davaaiyaan sirf anti malaria campan ke paas hi maujuud thi, iske kaaran majabuuran privet health centre ko bhi bataanaa padaa ki unke yahaan malaria kaa mariz he
 The Anti Malaria Campaign ran a 24-hour hotline
 beemaari ko failane se bachaane ke liye marizon kaa alag se ilaj kiya
 The Sri Lankan cabinet has decided that the Malaria Liberation Campaign will get and get ten percent more budget every year
 is puure maamle main do shabdon kaa zikr aayega
 Vector and Parasite
 vector kaa matlab jo vaahak hota he
 Which carries vector kaa matlab machhar hua
 Female Anopheles mosquito
 parasite plasmodium is machhar ke andar hota he or jab machhar katata he to wo parasite insaan main jaakar malaria jaisi beemaari ko janm detaa he
 The Sri Lankan expedition thought of curing this Palasmodium parasite
 yani is par atake kiya
 From 1999 onwards, malaria patients started declining rapidly and till 2008 only 1000 cases were reported every year
 sadakon kii safai par khaas dhyaan rakhaa gaya
 Water was not allowed to accumulate so that mosquitoes do not thrive
 gramin ilaakon main ilaaj muhaiyaa karaane ke liye mobile malaria clinics banaae gaye
 India likewise got rid of polio
 polio mukti abhiyaan bhi kam shandaar nahin he
 Sometimes you will take time to read the details of this campaign and then you will know how at any given time someone comes to your door with polio medicine
 ek aise mausam main jab bharat main log dengue chikangunia se karaah rahe hai, srilanka se malaria mukti kii yah khabar hamaare bheetar bhi sapanom ko jagaati he
 So let's talk
 puri duniya main 320 karod log malaria ke khatre ke bich rahete hai
 Liberation campaigns are going on all over the world
 2015 main malaria se duniya bhar main 4 lakh logon kii maut hui he
 There have been 21 crore malaria cases
 tippaniyan There are many countries like United Arab Emirates, Morocco, Maldives, Armenia, Turkmenistan which have got rid of malaria in the last seven to eight years
 WHO kaa target he ki 2030 tak 35 deshon ko malaria free karne kaa
 Which also includes India and Indonesia
 WHO kaa kahana he ki agle 15 saal tak fundig ko tiguna karnaa padegaa agar ye target puraa karnaa chaahate hai to
 The Government of India has also set a target of eradicating malaria by 2030 in February this year
 us dauraan hyderabad ke freelans patrkaar vivekanand nemana or unke saath logon ke paise se chalane vaale WNYC radio ke liye kaam karne vaali patrkaar ankitha raav ne hindu or aljazira dot kaam ke liye lanbaa or pathneey lekh likhaa he
 This research of both was funded by the readers
 aap darshakon ke fund se ab bahut si website chal rahi hai jahaan news channelon se acha kaam ho rahaa he
 However, Vivekananda and Ankita have done an in-depth study of all the data related to the eradication of malaria in India and in 2014, 90% of the malaria control budget was spent in administrative work
 dawa, machharadaani or chhidkaav ke liye 10 pratishat hi bajet bachaa
 While the disease is causing a loss of about Rs 13000 crore to India's economy every year
 adivasee ilaakon main malaria kaa bhayanak aatank he
 Vivekananda and Ankita Rao say that no one knows exactly how many deaths from malaria occur every year
 2015 main malaria se marane waalon kaa sarkari aankada 300 he jabaki britain kaa pratishthit health jarnal lanset kaa anumaan he ki bharat main har saal 50,000 log malaria se mar jate hai
 There is no concrete evidence that every malaria death is reported
 bahut log aspataal pahunchane se pehle hi bukhaar se mar jate hai
 Both authors had also stated that the goal of distributing the mosquito nets containing the medicine was that it would be distributed among 25 crore people but not one percent was distributed among the people
 donon ke lekh main is baat par jor diya gaya he ki malaria se mukti par jor hona chahie
 This is an urgent matter but nothing will be achieved by mere announcement

 There is no concrete evidence that every malaria death is reported
 bahut log aspataal pahunchane se pehle hi bukhaar se mar jate hai
 Both authors had also stated that the goal of distributing the mosquito nets containing the medicine was that it would be distributed among 25 crore people but not one percent was distributed among the people
 donon ke lekh main is baat par jor diya gaya he ki malaria se mukti par jor hona chahie
 This is an urgent matter but nothing will be achieved by mere announcement
 srilanka cabinet kaa faisla he ki malaria mukti abhiyaan ko har saal das fisadi adhik bajet milegaa or miltaa he
 In this whole case, two words will be mentioned
 vector or parasite
 Vector means the carrier
 jo dhota he
 Vector means mosquito
 femail anophyles machhar
 The parasite Plasmodium is inside this mosquito and when the mosquito bites, the parasite enters the human and gives rise to malaria-like disease
 srilanka ke abhiyaan ne is palasmodium parasite kaa ilaaj karne kaa sochaa
 That is, attacked it
 1999 ke baad se malaria ke marizon main tezi se giravat aane lagi or 2008 tak to har saal sirf 1000 cese hi report hote rahe
 Special attention was paid to cleanliness of the roads
 pani jamaa nahin hone diya gaya taaki machhar na panpen

 In both the articles, it has been emphasized that freedom from malaria should be emphasized

 India likewise got rid of polio

 Sometimes you will take time to read the details of this campaign and then you will know how at any given time someone comes to your door with polio medicine

 unhone kaha, ‚Äòpichhlaa khulaasa jab hamane kiya tha to bijepi waalon ne bolaa tha ki inlogon kii khulaason kii saptahik mandi lagati he
 We say that you (BJP and Congress) have done so many scams together that they should be marketed daily

 This list was a detailed information about the money of Indians deposited in Swiss banks during December 2006
 ‚Äôkejariwal ne kaha, ‚Äòhamen kuch logon ke naamon kii jaankaree mili he baakiyon kii nahin mili

 'kejriwal further said,' The way to open accounts in Swiss banks is serious
 desh kii samprabhutaa or suraksha par khatra he
 People with HSBC come to you and open an account and later can deposit cash money in it and at the same time you do not have to go to Geneva to withdraw cash from it
 bank vaale aapako cash nikaal kar haath main de jate hai
 Similarly, if a terrorist from Pakistan wants to bring money to India, then it can be brought through HSBC

 aisa nahin he ki bharat sarkaar ko isaki jaankaree nahin he lekin wo is par koi karrwai nahin karnaa chaahate

 'kejriwal demanded,' Top officials of HSBC should be arrested under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act
 ‚Äôarvind ne bataaya ki 2010 ke andar america ne ek kanoon banaaya ki kisi bhi desh ke bank ko vahaan kaam karne ke liye usamen khole gaye saare acount kii jaankaree deni padegi
 Can India not pass such laws now? Can, but the government will not, because the money of many big names in the government is deposited in Swiss banks
 ‚Äôkejariwal ne echesbisi main karyrat bhartiya karmchaariyon se naukari chhodane kii apil kii
 He said, '32,000 Indians work at HSBC

 bahubali prabhas (prabhas) kii film 'saaho' (saaho) ne box offis par dhuandaar opening kii thi

 According to Box Office India website, 'saho' has so far earned only Rs 149 crore in the Hindi version
 film ke is collection ko dekhte hue kamaal aar khan (kamaal r Khan) ne twit kiya, jisamen unhone bataaya ki prabhas kii 'saaho' ko lekar kii gai unki bhavishyavaanee sach ho gai he
 Actually, the Bollywood actor had speculated about 'saaho' that the film would not be able to remain on screen for long
 i said this before the release of # Saaho and same thing happened
 https: / / t
 co / nnd8dzhuc3apane is twit (tweet) ko retweet karte hue actor kamaal aar khan (kamaal r Khan) ne likhaa ki jo maine kaha tha vah sach ho gaya
 Kamal r Khan retweeting Saho's first tweet, wrote, "I said this before the release of Saaho and now it is coming true
" " bataa den ki saaho ne apane chaute hafte main keval 50 lakh rupee kaa collection kiya he
 The film also featured Shraddha Kapoor in the lead role alongside Prabhas
 collection ke alaava film samikshakon kii ummiido par bhi khari nahin utari thi
 Talking about Kamal r Khan, the Bollywood actor made his mark through films 'deshrohi' and 'bigg Boss 3'
 iske alaava kamaal aar khan apane twit ke liye bhi khub jane jate hai
 Through his tweet, he not only offers his views on contemporary issues but also reviews films
 hawa main to pichley kareeb 5 saal se bagdadi ud rahaa he, magar ab jab iraq or syria main sena ke hamale se uski hawa kharaab hone lagi he to usne apane aatank ko bhi hawaii bana diya he
 This air terror of Baghdadi is actually a drone, in which the terrorists of Baghdadi are attacking the army bases by filling ammo
 philhal udate hue is hawaii aatank ne koharaam machaa rakhaa he
 This air terror of Baghdadi has killed many people so far
 ab ise bagdadi kii shaitani khopadi kaa khurpench kahen yaa uski bevakoofi, magar ab iraqi or america sena ke jangi jahaazon kaa jawaab wo apane in chote-chote drone se dene kii koshish kar rahaa he
 Wherever Baghdadi's terrorists cannot reach or cannot muster the courage to reach, this small terrorist blows them in the air
 ye chota aatanki aksar jitna nuksaan pahunchaa jaataa he, wo sachmuch ke aatanki yani bagdadi ke gurgey nahin pahunchaa pate, or jo aatank failaae wo aatanki hi to kehalaayegaa
 At the behest of Baghdadi, this small terrorist has so far taken a dozen people in Mosul
 magar bagdadi kaa ye mishan isliye fail hota ja rahaa he ki uske drone ne jin logon ko maaraa wo aam shahari the
 Otherwise, the Iraqi soldiers, after firing swiftly, dropped this Baghdadi drone there
 or unhen sena ke thikaanon par mandaraane kaa mauka hi nahin diya
 Yes, whether it is Iraqi or both American forces have believed that this small terrorist of Baghdadi is definitely bothering them
 aatankiyon kii taraf se chori-chhipe sena ke thikaanon par kam ghaatak bam giraae ja rahe hai
 Those who are only causing a little restlessness and seeing their texture and shape, it is clear that they do not even have the recommendation to carry more ammo
 yun bhi is drone ke zarie bagdadi kaa maqasad koi bahut baari tabaahi machaane kaa nahin he
 He simply wants to capture those pictures in the camera fitted in this drone so that he can tell the world that he is still not weak
 bagdadi ke in drone main camere or jeepies ke alaava am yani nishaanaa lagane kii divaais bhi install he
 Through which he is trying to target the targets of the army
 yani aam ke aam or guthliyon ke daam
 Shooting on one side and photography on the other side
 mosul ke uttari hisse main hathiyaaron ko bharkar le ja rahe sena ke is trek ko aatankiyon ne drone se nishaanaa banaaya or ek dhamaake ke saath sab kuch tabah kar diya
 Many such pictures have been captured in the camera of a flying terrorist of Baghdadi
 sena ke base par udakar bagdadi kaa ye chota aatanki oonchai par mandaraata he to thik se dikhaai bhi nahin detaa
 But when he leaves such small rockets from the air, the soldiers do not even get a chance to escape
 bagdadi ke drone ne yahaan hamalaa to kiya magar usase na to koi zyaada tabaahi machi or na hi kisi maut
 Yes, but for a while, fear was definitely born
 kul milakar bagdadi chahta bhi yahi he ki uske ye udate aatanki sena ko apane hamale se bhatkaate rahen, taaki jis takat ke saath mosul main us par chadhaai kii ja rahi he usamen kami aa sake
 According to the information so far, ISIS has conducted more than three dozen drones attacks on Iraqi military bases in Mosul
 or in hamalon main kareeb ek darjan log maare gaye
 But not a single soldier is included in those killed
 mosul main darasal bagdadi rose nae-nae prayog isliye kar rahaa he kyonki use pataa he ki hazaron kii taadaad main iraqi or kareeb 1700 america sainik bahut tezi se uski taraf maut kaa paigaam liye bad rahe hai
 The success of Baghdadi in the sandy plains of Mosul is less successful and more disrespectful
 jin drone ko udaakar bagdadi iraqi or america sena ko daraane kii koshish kar rahaa he
 The American commander stationed in Mosul says that children play with such drones
 ye sachai bhi he ki drone ko hawa main udaakar jitani tabaahi machaane kaa bagdadi ne plan banaaya tha
 He could not cause much destruction from him
 neeche america ke commando to upar bagdadi kaa aatankwaadi
 In this desert, below is the American army fighting with Iraq and above it the American-made drone is fighting for Baghdadi
 neeche america sena bagdadi ke aatankiyon ko thikaane laga rahi he to upar america drone iraqi sena ke thikaanon par hamalaa bol rahaa he
 It is very possible that the drone which is flying in Baghdadi Mosul, you have seen in your area
 ye darasal hawa main udne vaala ek khaas tarah kii takanic se las khilone jaisaa jahaaz he, jiskaa istemaal bade deshon main jeepies ke zarie saamaan kii delivery karne or trephic par nazar banaae rakhane ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Baghdadi is planning destruction by equipping these drones with ammo, grenades and small rockets
 america sena ke mutabiq iesas in drone ke zarie hamalaa karne ke alaava unka istemaal isliye bhi kar rahaa he taaki ye pataa laga sake ki iraqi sena kahaan-kahaan mortar daagne vaali he
 Accordingly, the fighters of Baghdadi also decide their target
 aaj sirf iesas hi nahin, balki iraqi fuj ne bhi in drone kaa istemaal mosul kii ladaai main kiya he
 But drones used in the military are different from common drones
 takanic ke lihaaz se wo bagdadi ke drone se kahin behatar hai
 In the Battle of Mosul, the Iraqi army is rendering such attacks useless by locating fidayeen attackers with the help of drones
 america sena ke paas bagdadi ke in drone kaa tod pehle se maujuud he
 They use a special technology to jam the GPS systems of such drones and take them down
 magar jin iraqi sainikon ke paas ye takanic nahin he wo bandook se nishaanaa lagaakar hi bagdadi ke drone ko bekaar kar rahe hai
 According to one information, so far, two dozen terrorist drones have been killed by Iraqi soldiers
 bagdadi kaa ye udata aatanki bhale khatarnaak sabit ho saktaa ho, magar iskaa ye katai matlab nahin he ki ye bagdadi kii koi bahut badi kamyaabi he
 Such drones are common in the market, which can be easily assembled through information on the Internet
 iraqi sena ke kabze main bagdadi ke ye wo tamaam drone hai jo tabaahi ke makasad se mosul main udaae gaye the
 But they were already thwarted
 pichley saal hi iraqi sena ko bagdadi ke is nae plan kii bhanak lag gai thi
 When drone-making items were found at some IS areas in Mosul
 jiske baad hi sena ne ehtiyaat ke liye kai kadam uthaae or isi vajah se bagdadi kaa plan fail ho gaya
 Like Chessboard, Baghdadi has put his pieces in Iraq and Syria to save the Sultanate of Panic
 inamen kuch chote hai to kuch bade hai
 Some are heavy and some are just pawns
 magar is bisaat ke pyaadon ko kam mat samajhiega
 These looks are definitely small
 magar asar inkaa itnaa he ki saamne vaale ke kile ko ek jatke main bhed dete hai
 Baghdadi is trying to save his throne by keeping them in front of him and now he also has the highest hopes from them
 sinjar kii pahadiyon par chadhakar bagdadi ke aatankiyon ne pichley kai saalon main jo tabaahi machaai, hamane to bas vahi dekha
 The honor of women was wired
 duniya ne aah bhari
 The elderly and the soldiers were killed
 sab kaa dil baith gaya
 But if the story ends there, it was still a honor
 hakeekat ye he ki kahani to uske baad shuru hoti he
 The story that came from Baghdadi's stronghold is of two innocent people whose fathers and grandfathers killed Baghdadi
 maa-bahanon kii izzat ko uske jallaadon ne lut liya or unhen qayaamat ke is din ke liye bachaakar rakhaa
 Yes, this story is about Amjad and Assad
 wo do yazidi ladke jinhen maa kii god se aatanki chin laae the
 For years, his mind was poisoned
 haathon main khilone kii jagah ye baari bharkam eke-47 thamai gai
 And now it is Baghdadi's turn to take advantage of the lives of these innocent people
 aaj inhen bilkul alag tarah kaa kaam diya gaya he
 They are welding vehicles according to their mission
 use paint kar rahe hai
 But the question is, what is the mission that these little innocent have got for which they are holding the gun
 asal main bagdadi inhen apane khauf ko kam karne ke liye istemaal karnaa chahta he
 The fear that Kurdish, Iraqi, Shia-militia and American forces have created for him
 maut kaa khauf
 Baghdadi wants revenge with these forces
 apane aatankiyon kii maut kaa badla
 Revenge for the destruction of their bases
 apni zamin ke kho jane kaa badla
 The revenge for his panic subsides and for this, all these changes will take these two children of Yazidi community
 pichley 3 saalon tak inke dimag main itnaa zehar bhar diya gaya he ki ab ye apana mazahab bhi badal chuke hai or apana maqasad bhi
 Now they are ready to do anything for Baghdadi
 aatank kii training to ye pehle hi le chuke hai or ab inhone aatank failaane kii kasam bhi kha lee he
 It has been brain washed that they now think exactly what Baghdadi tells them to think
 bagdadi us bhalaa kaa naam he jo apane phaayde ke liye kuch bhi kar saktaa he
 He will not just leave them to die, but through them, he will deliver his terror message to the world
 bacchon ko mishan par bhejne se pehle inhen kii zabaani wo duniya ke bhatke hue naujavaanon ko bargalane kii koshish kar rahaa he
 Through them, he is trying to tell how bad and lonely the world is
 intervyuu khatm hua or ab in bacchon ke liye bagdadi par qurbaan hone kii baari he
 One of them, Amjad, has been given the key to this carriage loaded with gunpowder
 jisamen sirf driver ke baithne kii jagah he varanaa to isamen sirf barood kaa ambara bharaa he
 By now you must have understood why Baghdadi has raised them for so many years
 wo isliye taaki wo inhen fidaayin bana sake or ye uske liye jaan de saken
 The journey of death started with the pressing of the start button in the car
 target dur khadey sena ke ye tanker hai, jinhen ek takkar ke saath tabah or barbaad karnaa he
 Through the streets, Amjad drove this ammo-filled carriage to the exact spot where the four Iraqi army tankers stood together
 ek dhamaakaa hua
 The whole area resonated
 aag kii lapten saikadon feet upar tak ai or ek pal main sab kuch barbaad ho gaya

 However, he did not say anything about the role of the army in the decision making process in Pakistan

 According to the administration, it may take months to open the way to the gate of heaven to Kedardham, but the good news for the devotees is that a second way to Kedardham has been found
 kedarnath jane vaale jis raste kaa pataa mila he, uskaa istemaal saikadon saal pehle hua karata tha
 The route to Kedarnath from Ukhimath to Chaumasi is closed for years, but in the eyes of the experts, that road is less damaged than the current one
 kedarnath jane ke liye jis root kaa abhi istemaal hota he, vah haridwar se shuru hota he
 The first stop of the Kedarnath yatra is Devprayag, 49 km from Haridwar
 iske baad 32 kilometre kaa safar kar shraddhalu srinagar pahunchate hai
 Climbing after Srinagar is sharp
 yahaan se takreeban 35 kilometre ke baad rudraprayag aata he, jo samudr tal se 2000 feet kii oonchai par he

 guptkashi se lekar gaurikund tak sadaken bani hai
 Even vehicles come, but everything is closed before Gaurikund
 kedarnath jane kaa doosraa rasta inhen donon jagahon ke bich se shuru hota he
 Kedarnath is 22 km from Chaumasi village
 yahaan se jane vaale raste ko nuksaan bhi kam hua he, lekin chumasi gaanv ilaake se puri tarah cat chukaa he
 With the help of the local people, the army has found another way to go to Kedarnath, but is it possible to prepare it so soon
 is bare main visheshgyon kii raay lee ja rahi he
 The new way to visit Kedarnath is being talked about, it is actually a centuries old way
 is raste pehle kedarnath pahunchane main ek maheene se bhi zyada kaa vakt lagata tha
 But experts say, if this route is immediately rectified, it will be impossible to reach the Kedar valley
 haalanki is raste main chunautiyaan bahut zyada he
 The NIM team has gone with mountaineers to explore this route, but the new path is not only longer than the first, but also full of difficult challenges
 itani mushkilon ke baad bhi agar yah rasta khul jaae to kedarnath pahunchane ke saath raste main fanse logon tak raahat saamagree pahunchane or tabah hue gaanvon ko basaane main kargar ho saktaa he
 Despite the difficult path, there is excitement among the devotees
 haalanki is raste ke shuru hone main vakt kareeb ek maheene ke kareeb lag jayega, lekin tabaahi ke baad durgam ho chuki kedarghati main jivan ke sanchaar kaa rasta khul jayega

 We are living in extreme times of social media
 jahaan twitor par trending khabaren hai
 There is viral content on Facebook and sneaky jokes on whatsapp
 mata ke sandesh hai
 It is a blessing to share them more and more
 abhi beete dinon mere whatsap par ek massej aayaa
 Seeing this message, my mustache blossomed
 haalanki mujhe khud bhi nahin pataa ki baanchhein kahaan hoti hai
 The mind started planting dolls during childhood
 darasal, yah chhuppan chhupaai se judaa massej tha
 Hidpan hid, which we like to cover in Hindi and in English By God - By Mother, and talkatively in our English medium schools, which also show the love of reading in this English game, is called Ice Pice
 do
 to hua kuch aisa ki beete din jab ekavatsap macejakahin-kahin se hote hue hamaare phone par aayaa to ham sochane par majaboor ho gaye
 It was written in that message that what we have been calling Ice Pice till now is actually i Spy
 is massej ko padhate hi chehre par ek ankahi or vismayi muskaan aa gai
 Itching started in the brain
 man phir se unheen andheri galiyon or biabaan main bhatakane laga jahaan meraa bachapan beetaa tha
 Maybe i am the only person to feel like this or there may be thousands like me
 un dinon kii baat hi kuch or thi
 In the evening, the children ran towards the old ruined factories or the fields
 tab na phone tha or na phone par katane vaali shaamein thi
 Whatever was there was just and real
 sau fisad khara
 Without any adulteration
 ham puwaal kii dher main khud ko saans rokkar kuch aise chipa liya karte ki america kii FBI bhi na khoj paae or dusron ko aise khoj liya karte jaise apane mujrim ko byomakesh bakshi
 During the counting of a boy and girl who became a thief, they had to open their eyes and trace their location and find their known enemy as soon as they completed the count
 kisi ke dikhte hi Ice Pice kahana or chor par dhappa maare jane par bacchon kaa aisi-aisi jagahon se nikalnaa jisaki kalpana karke hi aaj rome-rome romanchit ho uthta he
 Neither care about getting dirty of clothes nor risk your life and jump from the roof to kill the thief
 agar isi raftaar se jari rakhte to olympix main desh kaa to ek medal pakkaa tha
 The first to come out when his favorite becomes a thief is that he has no problem
 uski ek muskaan par apana sab-kuch nyochaavar karne ko taiyaar
 The most interesting part of the game would have been to tell the location of the remaining people with an eye gesture and then quickly become a thief
 kasam se bahut yaad aate hai ve din
 Forgive this Ice Pice
 i Spy again brought all the floors in front of the eyes
 vaise shukriya rahegaa technology or whatsap kaa ki unhone phir se hamen ye sab yaad dilaayaa or inke madhyam se ham ek baar phir unki yaadon ke galiyare se tarotaaja hokar waapas laut aae hai
 
 
 a post shared by yokesh (@ yokeshabi0411_official) on Jul 8, 2018 at 8:49 pm PDT uttar pradesh main pratapgarh jile ke kunda main pichley dinon police adhikari jiyaul haq sahit teen logon kii hatya kii gutthi sulajhane ke liye kendriya jaanch beuro (sibiai) ne apni jaanch shuru kar di he
 Sources say that to get to the bottom of this murder case, the CBI will first have to find Haq's service revolver and mobile phone under all circumstances
 sio hatyakand kii jaanch sibiai ne shuukravaar ko kunda pahunchakar shuru kar di, lekin is team ke saamne sabase badi chunauti jiyaul haq kii sarvice revolver, bullate ke khokhe or unke mobile phone ko talashna he
 The CBI officials themselves believe that the evidence has been cleverly erased so that the investigators do not face anything
 sibiai ke ek adhikari ke mutabik, unka sabase pehla lakshya shahid police adhikari kii sarvice revolver or mobile ko dhundhna he
 Only then can anything further be done in this massacre
 philhal sibiai ne is maamle main jaanch kii taraf apane kadam badha die hai
 CBI sources say that firstly the call details of 23 people, including former minister Raja Bhaiya, directly or indirectly connected to this criminal act are being investigated
 in logon ke alaava sibiai shahid police adhikari ke nambar kii bhi kol detail nikalava rahi he taaki koi suraag mil sake
 This CBI officer says that after visiting the scene, prima facie it has come to the fore that all the evidence related to this murder has been erased very clearly
 sibiai kaa yah bhi maananaa he ki postermatum report ko lekar bhi jo bhraamak sthiti bani hui he, us par jald hi karrwai kii jaaegi
 It is to be known that Parveen, wife of martyr police officer Ziaul Haq, had made a statement to the media on the day of the murder that he had been shot three bullets, but only one shot was revealed in the post-mortem report
 tippaniyan These CBI officials say that at present, a post-mortem report has been sought from the district administration and if needed, a post-mortem can also be conducted again of Ziaul Haq's body
 sutron kaa kahana he ki jaanch kaa abhi shuruaati daur he, isliye abhi se hi alag-alag tarah kii atakalein nahi lagaai jaani chahie
 As the investigation progresses, there will be many more revelations in this massacre
 ullekhneey he ki sibiai kii taraf se sio hatyakand main jo chaar praathmiki darj kii gai hai, unamem sio, gram pradhan nanhe yadav or unke bhai ramesh yadav kii hatya tathaa balipur gaanv main hui hinsa kaa maamla darj kiya gaya he
 The investigation into the CO massacre started on Friday by the CBI reaching Kunda, but the biggest challenge before this team is to find Jiaul Haq's service revolver, bullet kiosks and his mobile phone
 sibiai ke adhikari khud is baat ko maan rahe hai ki saakshyon ko badi chaturaai se mitaayaa gaya he taaki jaanchakartaaon ke haath kuch na lage
 According to a CBI official, his first target is to find the service revolver and mobile of the martyred police officer
 uske baad hi is hatyakand main aage kuch kiya ja saktaa he
 At present, the CBI has stepped up its investigation in this case
 sibiai ke sutara bataate hai ki sabase pehle to is aapraadhik krity se pratyaksh yaa apratyaksh taur par jude purv mantri raja bhaiya sahit 23 logon kii kol detail khangaali ja rahi he
 Apart from these people, CBI is also getting out the call details of the number of the martyred police officer so that any clue can be found
 sibiai ke yah adhikari bataate hai ki ghatnasthal par jane ke baad pratham drushtya to yahi saamne aayaa he ki is hatya se jude sabhi sakshya badi safai se mitaae gaye hai
 The CBI also believes that the deceptive situation that persists regarding the post-mortem report will be taken soon
 gyaat ho ki shahid police adhikari jiyaul haq kii patni parveen ne hatyakand ke din hi media ke saamne yah bayaan diya tha ki unhen teen goliyaan maari gai hai, lekin postermatum report main keval ek hi goli lagane kii baat saamne ai he
 The comments sibiai ke yah adhikari bataate hai ki philhal jila prashasan se postmortem report maangi gai he or yadi jarurat padi to jiyaul haq ke shav kaa dobaaraa postmortem bhi karaayaa ja saktaa he
 Sources say that the investigation is in the initial stage, so different speculation should not be done from now itself
 jaise-jaise jaanch aage badhegi vaise-vaise is hatyakand main kai or khulaase honge
 It is noteworthy that out of the four firs registered by the CBI in the CO murder case, a case of murder of CO, village head Nanhe Yadav and his brother Ramesh Yadav and violence in Balipur village has been registered

 maanjhi ke in bayanon par gaur karen to pataa chalata he ki nitish kumaar sidhe taur par unke nishane par hai
 At a function in Patna on August 13, 2014, Manjhi says, "I have no hesitation in admitting that corruption is rampant in government machinery from top to bottom
" ‚Äù itnaa hi nahin apni baat ko sach sabit karne ke liye maanjhi ek ghatana kaa bhi zikr karte hai
 Manjhi explains how his family members had to pay a bribe of Rs 5000 to improve the electricity bill
 maanjhi yaheen nahin rukate, wo kehete hai, ‚Äúek naagarik ke rup main main anubhav se kah saktaa hum ki rishwat kii peshkash kiye bagaiyr sarkari karyaalayon main prakhand str tak koi kaam nahin hota
 "manjhi's statement indicates that 'corruption prevails in Bihar'
 to kya nitish kumaar ke sushasan kii hakeekat yahi he? kya maanjhi logon ko yah samajhane kii koshish nahin kar rahe hai ki ek taraf to nitish sushasan or bhrashtachar ko lekar ‚Äòjiro tolerance‚Äô kii baat karte hai ‚Äì or duusari taraf kamishankhori neeche se lekar upar tak fal phool rahi he
 Was the mere conversion of corrupt officers' homes into a government school? Manjhi is probably trying to explain this
 apane home toun gaya main to maanjhi ne badi maasoomiyat se kah daalaa ki nitish ke shashan main vikaas bhale hua ho, par bhrashtachar tab bhi kam nahin hua tha
 Statements childish or political sense? Last year when Manjhi's statements were disputed, JDU president Sharad Yadav advised him to exercise restraint
 lekin maanjhi apane mishan main lage rahe
 In Bihar, where Lalu Prasad has been calling the upper castes as bad, in Uttar Pradesh, Mayawati has been targeting the same section as 'manuvadi'
 pichley saal november main ek kaarykram main maanjhi ne logon ko bataaya ki unhen har koi thokar martha he, lekin ye thokar unhen phayda bhi pahunchaate hai, shaayad aage bhi phayda mili
 Manjhi says, ‚Äúbeing a Mahadalit family, i have stumbled since childhood
 thokar khate-khate mukhyamantri ban gaya, kahin yahi thokar mujhe pradhanmantri na bana de
 "whether Lalu Prasad or Mayawati or now Manjhi
 sabhi kaa makasad apane voter se conect hona he
 This not only gives them sympathy, but also gets votes from above
 aakhir raajnneeti hoti kisalie he?maanjhi ke samarthak maanate rahe hai ki unke bayaan se dalit khush hote hai or yahi vajah he ki wo daliton kii aawaaj banakar ubhare hai
 Manjhi also motivates Dalits as soon as the opportunity arises, ‚Äúdalit students should rise from caste and intermarry
 agar hamen ek badi raajnneetik takat bananaa he, tab hamen apni jansankhya ko 16 se badhaakar 22 pratishat karnaa hoga
 "manjhi's statements have been described by JDU leaders as childish, but not others," Manjhi said
 maanjhi ko bhale hi isse pehle bolne kii itani chhot nahin mili ho par unka raajnneetik anubhav lanbaa rahaa he
 Manjhi knows where his words are reaching and who is impacting them
 maanjhi samarthakon kaa maananaa he ki vah to bas aapbeetee sunaate hai ‚Äì or unki baton ko tod marodakar pesh kar diya jaataa he
 Manjhi knows that those who vote for him will be able to understand him better after his confession on bribe
 ab to unka voter tark bhi de saktaa he, ‚Äúrishwat aakhir koun nahin letaa he? kam se kam ek aadmi to he jisamen aage aakar sweekaar karne kii himmat he
 And henceforth he will not allow this to happen
 ‚Äù yani bhrashtachar par asli nakel to ab lagane ja rahi he
 There is talk maanjhi ke taaja bayaan ke baad dijipi ko patr likhakar un par samuchit karrwai kii maang kii gai he
 If you return home in the evening, you are not forgotten
 is jumale ko nitish samarthak bhale nazarandaaj karen, magar maanjhi samarthakon ko isse koi fark nahin padataa
 The thought with which Nitish had given Manjhi the chair, he is following the same
 fark sirf itnaa he ki maanjhi kaa countribution ab nitish ke bajaae khud unheen ke khate main jamaa ho rahaa he
 The batsman of Delhi Daredevils and the most expensive player of IPL, Yuvraj Singhka Ball, went against Mumbai on Tuesday after a long time
 team india se baahar chal rahe yuvi ne us samay ran banaae jab dilli ke baaki ballebaaj fail ho gaye the

 meraa dhyaan keval mere kaam par he
 In the current season of IPL-8, the Daredevils have won only four out of 10 matches so far
 dairedevills ko abhi chaar lig match or khilne hai
 The team must win all these matches to reach the playoffs
 yuvaraj ne kaha, 'ab hamaare liye karo yaa maro vaali sthiti he
 We have four matches and we have to win all the matches
 yah kaam mushkil he lekin naammumkin nahin

 He became India's sixth batsman to be dismissed on the first ball of the match
 ek gend baad pujaara bhi bhaagyashaalee rahe jab lackmal kii inaswing unke middle stump se kuch inch par se nikal gai
 Opener Shikhar Dhawan 08 hit the first four of the match on fast bowler Lahiru Gamage, but in the next over, Lakmal's ball was played on the wicket
 kharaab roshni ke kaaran khel rokna padaa jiske baad chaay kaa vishram lenaa padaa
 When the game resumed, Lakmal also lobbed skipper Virat Kohli (0) to give the hosts a third shot
 kohli ne diares kaa sahaara bhi liya lekin tisare ampire ne ampyres kol par unhen out qaraar diya, lekin bharat ne rivyuu nahin ganvaaya
 In the same over, Lakmal made a strong appeal against Rahane, but the umpire denied it
 lackmal kaa yah lagaataar chatha madan over rahaa
 Five balls from Gamage's next over, the match had to be stopped due to poor lighting which could not be restarted

 Samajwadi Party president Mulayam Singh Yadav has claimed that only his party has the power to oust the BSP from power and has sought public support for his party
 yadav ne buudhvaar ko sonbhadra main mandi samiti parisar main ek chunavi jansabha ko sambodhit karte hue kaha ki basapa sarkaar ne apane paanch saal ke shasankaal main sivaay bhrashtachar ke pradesh kii janata ke liye koi kaam nahin kiya he
 Claiming that his party has always fulfilled the promise made in his election manifesto when he comes to power, Yadav will fulfill his promise even if he comes to power this time
 tippaniyan The SP chief reiterated his promise in the party's election manifesto for all sections including farmers, unemployed, students and women, and said that his government will provide free medical treatment to all the poor of the society and will help in the treatment of serious diseases

 Yadav, while addressing an election public meeting at Mandi Samiti complex in Sonbhadra on Wednesday, said that the BSP government has done nothing for the people of the state except for corruption during its five-year rule
 yah daawa karte hue ki unki party ne satta main aane par hameshaa apni chunavi ghoshnaptr main kiye vaayade ko puraa kiya he, yadav ne is baar satta main aane par bhi ham apana vaayada nibhaaenge

 Since the announcement of elections in Delhi, every day a single question arises in my mind which party to vote for this time
 teenon mukhya partiyon ne siem ummidavaar ke naam kaa elaan karke kuch had tak meri is mushkil ko thodaa aasaan kar diya
 Still, there was confusion between the Aam Aadmi Party and the BJP over voting, but Kiran Bedi's style was e-bayan
 unki chand baton ne sari ulajhanein khatm kar deen
 i started thinking clearly about my opinion
 in chunaavon main main kiran bedi or bijepi ko vot duungaa, kyonki
 
 
 
 1
 The impact of a tough image: Kiran Bedi's image became that of a strict female police officer due to the lifting of PM Indira Gandhi's car from the administration Perno parking zone
 iskaa vaakye kaa asar unke pulisia kariyar main bhi dikhaa, shaayad aane vaale dinon main dilli ke prashasan par bhi dikhe
 Because the current system has the potential to succeed, all it needs is a strict and right direction administrator
 padhein- main ajay maakan ko vot duungaa, kyonki
 
 
 2
 naukarshahi kaa anubhavsatta chalaanaa bacchon kaa khel nahin he
 It has some nuances, such as bureaucratic work, law making process, etcetera
 
 
 sabase acchhee baat yah he ki kiran bedi usee naukarshahi kaa hissaa rahi hai, unka anubhav lagbhag 40 saalon kaa he
 Therefore, after becoming the Chief Minister, he will not take much time to understand the system and administration
 iske alaava unka jor vaadon se zyada delivery par he, jaisaa vah apane kariyar main karti ai hai
 Read - i will vote for Kejriwal, because

 The MCD has disappointed the Delhiites with a face that is most disappointed
 gali-muhallon kii badahaal civik vyavastha, bhavishya kii koi planning nahin
 The Delhi BJP and its leadership are responsible for all this
 ek pal ke liye dilli bijepi se bharosa uthne laga tha ki lekin bijepi alaakaman ne en maukey par kiran bedi ko party main shaamil kar ek baar phir se bharosa sthapit kar diya
 Trust of a face and a skilled administrator

 Improving Women's Safety Delhi has been identified as a rape city
 samaaj kii soch ke saath lachar police vyavastha mahilaon ke khilaaf badhate aparaadh ke liye jimmedaar he
 It will take a long time to change the mindset, but police reform can be started
 is disha main kiran bedi ke kaam se har koi waakif he, ab use lagu karne kaa vakt aa gaya he
 5
 modi ke vijan hi hai bedi kaa vijanaloksabhaa main maine narendra modi ko vot diya tha
 The administrative reforms and vision that Kiran Bedi has been talking about till now is part of the larger agenda of PM Modi
 yani ham bedi ke saath chalenge to kadam se kadam modi ke saath bhi milaayenge
 Apart from this, Bedi repeatedly talks about improving the system and running smoothly with the participation of the government and the public
 aam aadmi ko raajnneeti ke mukhyadhara se jodne kaa isse behatar tarika nahin he
 6
 pradhanmantri modi ko he bedi par vishwasavotor ke taur par aaj main spasht taur par jaanata hum ki main jis siem ummidavaar ke liye vot kar rahaa hum use pradhanmantri kaa vishwaas praapt he
 She also became a candidate after being persuaded by Modi
 modi ne is desh ko ek ummid di ki ham behatar kar sakate hai, ab dilliwaale ko bhi bedi main ek ummid najar aa rahi he
 7
 samvaad he kiran bedi kii euspikai partiyon ko janata se samvaad tut ke kaaran baari nuksaan uthaanaa padaa he
 But this is not going to happen with Kiran Bedi
 kabhi bahan to kabhi maa, sirf andaaj badalata he par badi hi safagoi se unki jubaan se nikali baat dimag or dil donon tak pahunch jaati he
 8
 tu kharaab isliye main acha kii raajnneeti nahin'tu kharaab he isliye main acha hum', is tarah kii raajnneeti ne desh kaa bedaa gark kar diya he
 To some extent also of Delhi
 aapke paas kya acha he? aap janata ko uske bare main bataaen
 This is what Kiran Bedi has done so far
 bedi kaa focus vijan or agenda par rahaa he or hamen isi sakaaratmak aprope kii jarurat he
 9
 40 saal eemaandaaree kekiran bedi ne kabhi khud ko eemaandaaree kaa thekedaar to nahin bataaya par 40 saal ke kariyar main unki nishtha par bhi kabhi sawaal nahin uthe
 If she were political, she would probably have retired as Delhi commissioner, but she considered voluntary retirement more appropriate
 40 varsh lanbaa vakt hota he isliye dilli ko unase tikaoo to nahin milane vaala
 10
 mahilaayein zyada samvedansheelghar chalaanaa to mahilaon ko hi behatar aata he
 Delhi too is its own home
 unki samvedansheeltaa aksar bade se bade se ghaavon par maraham lagane kaa kaam karti he
 i am not saying that men do not have these qualities, but Kiran Bedi is the need of the hour

 Significantly, on 10 September, Rahul Gandhi and Sonia did not get any relief from the High Court which dismissed their petition challenging the reopening of a 2011-12 tax assessment case

 Rahul made it clear that the party has very less time and too much work

 At present, the Congress is ruling in these 12 states of the country - Manipur, Mizoram, Assam, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Maharashtra, Arunachal Pradesh, Kerala and Meghalaya
 karaari haar ke sadame se abhi congress ubhari nahin he aise main party is ranneeti par kaam karne kii yojana bana rahi he ki jin rajyon main philhal uski sarkaar he vahaan acha pradarshan kiya jaae

 However, the opposition parties have rejected the proposal, saying that it is against the basic spirit of the Indian Constitution, wherein freedom to propagate or adopt any religion has been given

 Film actor Sanjay Dutt likes to work in films that are entertaining
 unhen aisi filmon main kaam karnaa pasand nahin he jo upadesh dene vaali ho
 Soon, the comedy film Chatur singh-two star, starring Sanjay Dutt, is set to appear on the silver screen among the audience
 sanjay ne bataaya, main aisi filmein karnaa chahta hum, jo darshakon kaa manoranjan kar sake
 i worked in films like Knock Out and Lamhe, but today's audience does not like films that have lectures or speeches
 darshakon ko lagata he ki vah aisi filmein kyon dekhe, jabaki vah aise muddon jaise kashmir ko lekar pehle se jaagruk hai
 He said, i have decided that i will only do films which are commercial
 main yahaan par darshakon ko upadesh dene ke liye nahin hum
 Apart from Sanjay, Anupam Kher and Ameesha Patel play the lead roles in Chatur Singh - Two Star directed by Ajay Chandhok
 film ke bare main sanjay ne kaha, yah ek hasya pradhan film he or vyavsaayik bhi he
 The story of the film is based on a police officer and helps Sonia (amisha) solve the cases
 unhone kaha, yah film chaalaak jasoos upanyaas par aadhaarit he, lekin isamen kai badlaav kiye gaye hai
 During the tour of areas like Vidarbha, Marathwada and Western Maharashtra for election coverage, i asked the farmers the same five questions, which every journalist usually does
 sawaal-kya aap ke sir par karj kaa boj he?jawaab- hansawaal- kya aapaki kamai main kuch vruddhi hui he?jawaab- nahinswaal- kya aapako upaj kaa uchit mulya miltaa he?jawaab- nahinswaal- kya sarkaar se chah hajaar rupee salanaa madad paryaapt he?jawaab- nahinswaal- kya desh main koi raajnneetik dal kisaanon kaa shubhachintak he?jawaab- koi nahin
 It is clear from the answer of the first four questions that the farmers are angry with the government for not paying enough attention to farming
 yah haal tab he jabaki kisaan sabase bade vot bank maane jate hai
 However, the answer to the last question certainly gives a sigh of relief for the ruling party

 In the rallies, BJP may have been talking to the previous government about the price of higher yield, but the farmers have not made it clear from anywhere that they are really getting the right price for the produce
 to kya pradhanmantri narendra modi ne kisaanon ke liye ek alag nerrative set karne or unki praathamiktaaon ko bhramit karne ke apane bhaashanon kaa upyog kiya
 In 2014, Narendra Modi sold dreams of good days with the promise of doubling farmers' income in rural areas of Maharashtra
 unhone us dauraan yaad dilaayaa tha ki das saal sharad pavaar ke krishi mantri rahane ke baavjood maharashtra ke kisaanon kii jindagi main badlaav nahin hua
 During that time he told many success stories of the farmers of Gujarat and said that the farmers of there (gujarat) are in good condition from the farmers of other parts of the country

 Even though Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis has mentioned the success of the Pradhan Mantri Crop Insurance Scheme on the ground, but in reality it remained less beneficiary

 He spoke on Hindutva for 20 minutes in that rally
 2014 main jati or dharm se upar uthakar kisaanon ne bijepi ko vot diya tha
 Even in 2019, farmers voted above caste and religion, but did they vote as farmers? The victory of the Congress in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh in 2018 and the Congress' better performance in Gujarat in 2017 is believed to have played a role in capitalizing the agrarian crisis there

 congress-ncp leaders held joint agitations across the state before the election, but in Rahul Gandhi's speeches during the campaign, Rafael topped the charts

 Cheng is said to have become almost entirely dependent on alcohol
 jab kabhi use bhukh lagati he vah tab tak shor machaata he jab tak ki use alcohol nahin parosa jaataa

 Residents here call the city as 'mini Bombay' because of its deep business links with the Mumbai metropolis
 yah shahar dhan kamata hi nahin he balki use is gadhi kamai ko kharch karne ke tareeke bhi maaloom hai
 There are more than a hundred flights daily from the city's airport
 isamen khaas baat yah he ki mumbai se aane-jane vaali udaanon main‚Äîmukhya rup se saptahanth main‚Äîkuch chuninda deshon ke yatriyon kii taadaad khaasi hoti he
 These are the countries most of which have rich historical and cultural heritage but now the situation is downhill and due to this people are contributing a lot to the oldest profession in the world - prostitution
 iske alaava kaam ke abhaav kaa sankat jhel rahi sine tarikaon kaa bhi indore aana-janaa aam baat he
 Of the money that is being spent on entertainment in Indore, a lot of money is going on sex instead of money

 The city of Indore, once ruled by the Holkars and dominated by the gentle and humble Marathi community, has probably come a long way in terms of spending its income
 indore ke ek banker kaa kahana he, ''vyapaar is shahar kii jeevanarekha he
 The average resident of Indore sees a relationship as a waste of time as it gets in the way of earning its wealth
 uske liye dhan ke badale sex kahin zyada behatar he, kahin koi bandish nahin
 Indore also attracts a large number of people coming from neighboring cities for work or study

 While prostitution is very expensive on one hand, such services are available for every income group
 pashchimi madhya pradesh main, jahaan indore sthit he, sex varkar samudaayon kii maujuudagi khaasi sankhya main he
 So it is not surprising that 48 percent of the participants in Indore accepted sex service in exchange for money
 baaki nishkarshon main, indore ke survey ne mahilaon ke yon mukti ke raste kii taraf bad chalane kii baat ko bhi ujagar kiya
 Out of the total female participants, a large number of 27 per cent of women claiming to use dildos for Anand, 66 per cent were from Indore
 yahi nahin, shahar ke pratibhaagiyon main se 75 fisad ke liye comarya hona koi mudda nahin tha

 Despite the prosperity and the changes that have come from it, there is a part of Indore city that still sees itself as a 'small town with all the good'
 yaheen par vaivaahik rishte ke baahar dhan ke badale kisi or ke saath sex karne or apni paariwarik sanrachana ko akshunn banaae rakhane ke bich kaa doharaapan najar aata he
 In this sense, Indore is not different from any other Indian city

 yah shahar na keval aabaadi main bad gaya he balki apane mahanagareey swaroop ke anuroop usamen suvidhaayen bhi bad gai hai
 The expansion of bars, nightclubs, malls, proximity to mountains and private educational institutions has ensured that it remains a favorite destination for the youth of neighboring states
 vividhtapurna yuva aabaadi vaala chandigarh shahar kuch dashakon pehle tak ruudhivaadee kii shrenee main aata tha
 But according to the participants, this image has changed radically
