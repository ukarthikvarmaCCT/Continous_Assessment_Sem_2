 2004 main patil ne paala badalte hue ensipi se chunaav ladaa or jeet hasil kii

 Former Union minister Gopinath Munde's death was called a murder rather than an accident
 shuja ne daawa kiya tha ki gopinath munde iviem hack karne kii baat jaan gaye the, jiske chalate unki hatya kara di gai
 Gopinath Munde became a cabinet minister in the Modi government, which had a strong majority in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 maharashtra main pichley kai varshon se bijepi ke liye mehnat kar rahe munde ko modi sarkaar ne uskaa inaam dete hue unhen kendriya gramin vikaas mantri banaaya gaya tha

 atakalein tej ho gai hai ki kya bhujabal ensipi chhod kisi anya party main jaaengbhi haal main ensipi ke purv saansad udayanraaje bhosle ne bijepi jwine kii thimaharashtra main vidhansabha chunaav hone hai, ise dekhte hue ensipi ke liye yah jhatka harashtravaadi congress party (ensipi) ke varisht netaa chagan bhujabal baagi rukh akhriyaar kar chuke hai
 Sharad Pawar held a big meeting on Monday in view of the Maharashtra Assembly elections
 is meeting main party ke sabhi bade netaa pahunche lekin chagan bhujabal baithak se gaayab rahe
 This move by Chhagan Bhujbal once again sparked a round of discussions in the political corridors of Maharashtra
 is baat kii afvaahen ud rahi hai ki kya chagan bhujabal chunaav se pehle sharad pavaar kaa saath chhod sakate hai?abhi haal main ensipi ke purv saansad udayanraaje bhosle bhartiya janata party (bijepi) main shaamil ho gaye
 In the presence of Union Home Minister Amit Shah and Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis in Delhi, Udayanraje Bhosle took primary membership of BJP
 bhosle ne beete shuukravaar ko loksabhaa kii sadsyta se istipha de diya tha
 This decision of Udayanraj has given a big blow to Sharad Pawar before the assembly elections in Maharashtra

 West Bengal Biodiversity Board has the vacancy of Project Assistant

 For more details click here is bajet ko mahangaai par lagaam lagaani thi, vruddhi ko raftaar deni thi, sarkaar main bharosa waapas laana tha or arthvyavastha main vishwaas jagaanaa tha
 All these were achieved a little but not strongly
 yah bajet beshak niraashajanak he
 There are many things, many small initiatives have taken place, but there is no glimpse of any big initiative
 ho saktaa he, arun jetali or narendra modi ne agle saal ke bajet tak intjaar karne kaa faisla kar liya ho jab nai endie sarkaar adhik anbhavi ho jaaegi
 India is waiting for a big concept and concrete action for that
 hamen shikhar par aise netaaon kii talash he jo diler faisle lene se na daren or na jhijaken
 Perhaps such leaders could have made us understand that the time has come to take India on a new path in an attempt to create a golden future for its children
 aisa kuch nahin hua or hamaare saamne aisa bajet aayaa he jise banane vaale kathor faisle lene ko taiyaar nahin dikhte
 Perhaps they have tried to please everyone and not make anyone unhappy
 lekin hasil kuch khaas nahin hua, bas thodaa-bahut idhar kaa udhar phent diya gaya he
 Good: The direction of reforms is visible
 At least the direction of reforms from the budget speech and other statements of Jettley shows what we can expect in the coming years: to bring the manufacturing sector back on track
 yah aisa kshetra he jiske liye behatar or adhik vishwasaneey vittiya niamak, niyoktaaon or shramikon donon ke liye lacheelaapan dikhaane vaale buniyadi shram sudhaaron, kaushal sudhaarney ke prayaason tathaa laghu or majhule udhyamiyon ke liye buniyadi puunji sulabh karaane kii jarurat he
 It also assumes that India needs to change the system defined by the APMC Act and farmers will have unrestricted access to markets in any part of India
 bajet kii yah manyata bhi swaagat yogya he ki saarvajanik or nijee bhagidaari apeksha ke anuroop nahin chal rahi he
 His direction will have to be changed
 agar ham laghu or majhole udyog kshetra ke liye dhan kii behatar uplabdhta, jisamen diwaliyapan kanoon jaise pramukh kshetron main samasyaon kaa samaadhaan shaamil he, ko bhi jod len to bhartiya arthvyavastha ke liye ek samgr disha hamaare saamne spasht ho jaati he
 The Bad: Figures that are not trustworthy include a tremendous increase in tax revenue when the economy is not growing very fast
 iske saath hi bajet khate main kharch utana zyada nahin he jitne kii aamtaur par sookhe vaale varsh main apeksha kii jaati he
 Overall this includes fiscal deficit 4 for 2014-15
 1 pratishat par rakhaa gaya he
 Failure will undoubtedly be involved in this
 saal ke ant tak yah aankada 4
 Will be around 6 percent
 aisa lagata he ki jetali ke peeche aankadon kii baazeegari karne vaale chidambaram kii chaaya kahin na kahin maujuud he
 Barring all this, there is no clear direction to deal with the problem of increasing subsidy burden
 yah to saaf he ki pariwaron ko laabh dene ke liye jari bharat kii sabsidi vyavastha main badlaav laana hoga
 Investment has to be encouraged instead of consumption
 sabsidi ko behatar lakshith karnaa hoga or licage kii ashanka vaale upayon se mukti pani hogi
 But there is nothing like this in the budget
 sabsidi main koi aisa badlaav najar nahin aata jo use productive sector kii ore le jaataa ho
 Be it the farmers or small and medium enterprises
 ausat: piesu main aadhe-adhure sudharsarkaar kii bahut badi sampatti anutpaadak saarvajanik kshetra main band padi he
 With the massive reforms in the public sector, there would have been great effort if there were large-scale privatization and disinvestment efforts
 isaki bajaae is vitt varsh main hamen vinievesh se kareeb 58,000 karod ru
 Are about to meet
 disha acchhee he lekin agar aasaani se sambhav ho sakane vaale upayon par thodaa or gaharaai se dhyaan diya gaya hota to behatar hota
 More allocation for security on both domestic and external fronts is a good move as it has been neglected for many years
 purvottar kshetra par adhik dhyaan dena uchit he kyonki iskaa bhi samay aa gaya he
 But a lot more needs to be done and we can only hope that this is just the beginning
 or aage kya?sarkaar ne thodaa-thodaa bahut kuch karne kaa faisla kiya he or ham yahi ummid kar sakate hai ki vah aage chalakar bade kadam uthaane ke liye khud ko taiyaar kar rahi he
 The experience of this team is still less and maybe modi-jaitley is giving himself and his team a little more time to work better
 yadi aisa he to hamen bajet 2015-16 kaa intjaar karnaa hoga jab topein danaadan chalengi
 Let that day also come
 dilli kii purv mukhyamantri or uttar-purv seat se congress pratyaashee shila dikshit ne nirbhaya gangrape cese par bada bayaan diya he

 centre or dilli sarkaar kaa hawala dene par shila dikshit se jab yah poocha gaya ki dilli main mahila suraksha kaa solution kya he to unhone bataaya ki yah centre sarkaar va sansad ke haath main he
 However, he also said that if he had a chance to reach Parliament, he would raise the issue there
 bataa den ki 16 disambar 2012 ko 23 saal kii chaatra ke saath dilli main chalati bas main 6 logon ne gangrape kiya gaya tha
 Nirbhaya was brutally tortured and Nirbhaya died after 11 days of treatment
 is ghatana ne puure desh ko hilaa diya tha
 There was outrage on the streets from Delhi to the whole country
 dilli or congress main us vakt congress kii sarkaar thi or dilli ke mukhyamantri kii jimmedaari shila dikshit sambhaal rahi thim

 Dawood disappeared from home a day earlier
 uskaa shav falon ke baag main mila
 There were several knife wounds on the body
 police ke pravaktaa ke anusaar, shuruaati jaanch se yah pataa chalaa ki riyaj kaa ek kareebi rishtedaar daud ko uske ghar se 2 janvari ko le gaya tha
 a police spokesperson said that during interrogation of the accused, it was revealed that Riyaz killed Dawood with a knife due to suspicion of establishing illegitimate relations with his stepdaughter
 bhartiya antariksh anusandhan sanghathan (isro) kaa pieselvi rocket 15 farvari ko andhra pradesh ke sriharikota sthit lonchpad se record todgaye vaale ek mishan par niklaa
 The rocket left 104 satellites in space, of which 101 were foreign customers
 thik ek din pehle 14 farvari ko duniya bhar kii hathiyaar banane vaali companiyon kaa jamaavada bangaluru main yojit chaar divasiy dwivarshik airo india 2017 main hua tha, jahaan unhone bhartiya sainya balon ke samaksh apane ladaaku jet, helicopteron or drone kaa pradarshan kiya tha
 The reason behind this was that during the next decade, the Indian Army plans to purchase military equipment worth more than $ 100 billion
 mahaj ek din ke antar main hue ye do alahada aayojan bharat kii kshamtaaon ke bich ke fark ko darshaate hai ki yah desh ek antariksh shakti ke bataur to puri tarah swaavlambee he lekin apni sainya takat ke maamle main puri tarah aaayaatit hathiyaaron par nirbhar he
 India's army is the third largest army in the world with a defense budget of 2 this year
 74 lakh karod ru
 Belongs to bharat duniya main raksha kshetra par kharch karne vaale deshon main chhathwein sthaan par he
 Despite this, around 60 percent of the military equipment is imported here
 bharat par aksar ''duniya ke sabase bade hathiyaar ayatak" kaa tamgaa lagaaya jaataa he or 2012 se 2016 ke bich desh ne kul vaishvik shastr aayaat kaa akele 13 fisadi apane naam kiya he
 The figures presented by the government in the Lok Sabha show that between 2013 and 2016, Rs 82,496 crore
 ke shastr aayaat kiye gaye
 Even though the new government is trying to get permanent membership for India in the UN Security Council, it should not forget the ironic fact that it makes a net purchase of its security from four countries among the five permanent members of the Council
 is aayaat kii vajah kshamta or samarthy ke bich kaa fark he
 India's defense production system — a vast system of arms factories, shipyards and laboratories employing two lakh employees — is unable to meet the needs of the military
 bharat main raksha kshetra ke saarvajanik upkram (deepiesu) is saal 57,000 karod ru
 Will supply weapons but it will be insufficient to meet the needs of the military forces
 is antar ko puraa karne ke liye of da-shelf aayaat kiya jaataa he jisase bhartiya udyogon ko praudyogikeey laabh main koi madad nahin milti he
 This was one of the major reasons that the Modi government included defense production sector in the 25 areas identified in its economic plan, so that the share of production in GDP could be increased to 25 per cent (from the current 16 per cent) and an additional 100 million
 To create employment
 aisi aayaat nirbharta ko palatney ke sarvaadhik samgr prayaason main ''mek in india" ko ginaya ja saktaa he
 In the last three years, the government has implemented a series of measures on this front, ranging from opening the defense sector to 49 per cent foreign direct investment (and in some cases exceeding it) to indigenously design to boost indigenous production, Includes the creation of the Developed and Manufactured (IDDM) category

 However, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has already said that the financial burden of farmers' debt waiver will not be imposed on the public through new tax
 sarkaar apane kharcho main katautee karke isaki bharpai karegi
 The comments yogi ne kaha tha ki unki sarkaar ne vibhinn hastiyon ke naam par honevaale 15 saarvajanik avkaashon ko samaapt kar diya he or isse salanaa kareeb 50,000 karod rupee ke rajasav kii bachat hogi

 Adhir Ranjan Chaudhary had given a statement that this happened in a misunderstanding

 If PM Modi is angry with this, he apologizes

 ' Inspired by the non-cooperation movement of Aam Aadmi Party chief Arvind Kejriwal, North MCD traders have also launched a non-cooperation campaign

 Book: Novels and Democracy (criticism) Author: Manager Pandey Price: 395 rupees Publisher: Vani Prakashan Page: 240 Manager Pandey is known as a committed critic in the Hindi literature world
 74 saal kii umr main bhi ve kisi bhi aalochak, lekhak se zyada sakriy hai
 Five simultaneous critical books from Vani Prakashan have been published recently
 kitabon kaa locarpan karne ke baad ‘jansatta’ ke niyamit saptahik kollam ‘kabhi –kabhaar’ main kavi-aalochak ashok vaajapei ne thik hi likhaa tha ki manager pandeya iklaute aalochak hai, jinaki ek saath paanch kitaaben prakashit hui hai
 These critical books related to poetry, novels, criticism, culture and interviews provide an opportunity for serious thinking for Hindi readers
 sahitya ,samaaj, or samskruti se bhartiya janamanas ke rishton kii padtaal karti hai or manushyata ko sthapit karti hai
 'novel and democracy' is divided into three sections
 pehle khand main upanyaas kii saidhaantiki he
 It explores the history, sociology of the novel as well as its relationship to capitalism and democracy
 unke liye aalochana sirf sahitya kii aalochana nahin he balki iske madhyam se ve dharm, samskruti, raajnneeti or samaajanneeti se sidhe-sidhe muthbhed karte hai
 That is, they seek new alternatives in criticism while creating opposition to the power system
 isiilie ve upanyaas ko teesri duniya kii pratinidhi vidha kaa darja dete hai
 In the countries of Asia, Africa and South America, Pandey examines colonialism and the subsequent situation through novels
 unhone likhaa he ki ‘upanyaas ne upniveshwaad se mukti ke baad samaaj main swatantraaa or loktantr ke liye sangharsh ko saamne laane main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai he 
 In many countries of Asia, Africa and South America, post-colonial governance has been such that it would be more correct to call internal colonialism
 aisi vyavasthaaon ke sach ko saamne laane vaale upanyaason ko uttar aupniveshak kehane ke badale upniveshwaad virdohi kahana zyada sahi hoga
 'manager Pandey has written elsewhere that literature is the only expression of aspiration for freedom from man's subjugation and freedom
 upanyaas ke samajashaastra par vichaar karte hue ve upanyaas ko aadhunik poonjivadi samaaj kii upaj maanatein hai
 Scientific development and rational consciousness are necessary for the novel to exist
 ve likhte hai ki “upanyaas ke astitv ke liye anivaary press, prakaashan or patr-patrikaon aadhunik yug ke vaigyanik vikaas kii dein he to uske lekhak or pathak ke rup main kriyasheel madhyavarg poonjivadi saamaajik sanrachana kaa parinaam he
 'while exploring the social basis of the novel, the author considered the novelist's inquiry into class consciousness, ideology and worldview
 ‘itihaas jahaan maun hota he vahiin sahitya mukhar hota he
 'literature fills that place and society which does not get a place in history
 manager pandeya kaa maananaa he ki teesri duniya main upanyaas itihaas bodh kii kala he 
 Although the novel was born in Europe
 yahaan upanyaas burjua samaaj kaa samarthak tha
 But in Asia, Africa and South American countries, it becomes a narrative of liberation from colonization
 haalanki ‘teesri duniya ke sabhi deshon main upanyaas kaa vikaas ek jaisaa nahin hua
 'liberation of foreign languages in African countries and freedom from foreign power by saving community is a major theme
 lekhak ne africa or dakshini america upanyaas main abhivyakt yatharth kii badi baarik padtaal kii he
 Social realism has been prominently expressed in Indian novels
 iske barakes africa upanyaason main manovaigyanik yatharthwaad or dakshin america upanyaason main jaadui yatharthwaad pramukh rup se aata he
 In the same section of the book, Pandey has mainly discussed Premchand and his legacy by placing nationalism at the center of Indian novels
 darasal, bhartiya upanyaason main pehle-pahal kisaan jivan kaa yatharth or swadhinata aandolan kii prastuti hoti he
 Premchand developed the tradition of Oriya narrator Fakir Mohan Senapati, expressing the reality of peasant life
 premchand ne isamen swadhinata aandolan ko jod diya
 Exploring Premchand's purpose, the author has written that "the historical context of Premchand's creativity was that of the independence movement
" is swadhinata aandolan kaa mukhya prayojan tha deshi-videshi shoshan se janata kii mukti
 In this, the struggle of the people was simultaneously feudalism, capitalism and foreign imperialism
 pashchim main samrajyavad , rashtrawaad or upanyaas kaa lagbhag samanaantar udai hua
 'but the arrival or rise of the novel in India took place in a different and cursed state
 yahaan upanyaas ke saamne upniveshwaad ke abhishaap kaa moort rup angrejiraj tha
 Opposition and resistance were the first condition of the novel being Indian
 ’ 1907-1947 tak ke kathalekhan main premchand ne aupniveshik bharat kii samskruthik aalochana kii he
 Critics have exposed the irony of Indian society and the exploitative system of the English Empire expressed in novels like Sevasadan, Rangbhoomi, Godan etc
 ‘ san 1857 kii viraasat or premchand’ naamak lekh main pandeya ji aandolan ke paraajay ke kaarnon kii talash karte hue sthapit karte hai ki ‘ premchand or bhagat singh ke swaraj sambandhi vichaaron ke is samya se sabit hota he ki premchand bhagat singh ke madhyam se bhi 1857 ki parampara se judate hai
 "the Question of Relevance and the Relevance of Premchand" is another important article in this section - "the Question of Relevance and the Relevance of Premchand"
 isamen aalochak ne sahitya se itihaas kii mahatta or sahitya, samaaj ke sambandhon ko roopayit kiya he
 Nirmal Varma had at times dismissed Premchand's relevance to art relative values
 yahaan aalochak ne nirmal verma or unke saamaan dharma burjua kalavaadiyon kii samaaj-nirpeksh or itihaas-yukt vichaardhaara kii gahari chaanbin kii he 
 Rejecting this anti-people and anti-marxist ideology, Professor Pandey establishes the relevance of Premchand
 vartmaan samantvaad , samrajyavad , varnavaad ke virodh hetu premchand kaa sahitya to praasangik he hi, saath hi ‘ premchand kii praasangikta kaa ek mahatvapurn paksh yah he ki ve hindi sahitya kii pragatisheel parampara, hindi sahitya kii rashtriya janavaadee parampara or hindi katha sahitya kii yathartwaadee janavaadee parampara ke nirmaataa hai
 The third section of the book focuses on practical reviews of some Hindi novels
 jainendra ke sunita or nagarjun kii ‘ratinath kii chachee’ upanyaason main stri swatantraaa ke prashn kii gahari padtaal he
 In Indian society, religion, publicity and patriarchy are the main factors of female subjugation
 sunita main stri mukti kaa prashn maansik he or yah stri-purush sambandhon par kendrit he
 In contrast to this, the question of the emancipation of women's subjugation has been threaded into social fabric in 'ratinath ki aunty'
 mithila ke gramin samaaj main vidhwaa gauri kii vyathaa-katha kaa roopak he yah upanyaas
 On one hand, the novelist strongly criticizes the priesthood, on the other, advocates sexual liberation of the woman
 nagarjun premchand kii parampara ke upanyaaskaar hai 
 But Nagarjuna has more localism than Premchand
 iskaa kaaran he ki nagarjun lokmat ko adhik baariki se pahachaanate hai 
 'ratinath ki aunty' portrays the contradictions of Indian society very strongly
 isiilie vah safal upanyaas he 
 The reason for writing on the novels 'sunita' and 'ratinath ki aunty' is contemporary discussion
 stri mukti kaa prashn hindi kathasahitya main bahut pehle shuru ho chukaa tha 
 About Jayendra, Pandey ji writes that for the last four-five decades, the process of deliberation and creativity on the problems related to the status of woman in the Indian society, the question of her subjugation and the aspiration for independence has been speeded up and broadened
 is prasang main yah sweekaar karnaa hoga ki rachana or vichaar ke str par is prakriya ko prarambh karne waalon main jainendra kumaar kii bhoomika agragami rahi he ’ranendra ke prasidd upanyaas ‘global gaanv ke devtaa’ kii samiksha yatharth se myth banate samudaay kii vyathaa-katha sheershak se he 
 The question of survival, self-respect and identity of the Asura tribal community of Jharkhand is in this novel
 vaidic kaal main asuron kaa daanveekaran karke unki hatyaein kii gayi, jo kalantar main mukhyadhara ke saamaaj dwaara jari rahi
 In the modern period, tribal communities became victims of imperialists and religious communal institutions
 pandeya ji ne likhaa he ki ‘ vartmaan samaaj main bharat ke adivasee samudaayon ke saamne ek khatra unmoolan kaa he or doosraa anukulan kaa
 Elimination means the end of existence, adaptation means losing their identity and merging with other religions, cultures and societies
 ’ bharat main hindu sampradayikta kaa ubhaar or udaarikaran kii prakriya lagbhag saath-saath dikhaai detii he
 The tribal communities live in mineral-rich areas
 unki apni samskruti ke saath-saath jal, jangal, jameen kii suraksha kaa sawaal unke liye behad jaruri he
 But due to the policies of globalization, their areas are being destroyed
 bhukh , bhay ,daihik shoshan or visthaapan unki mukhya samasya hai 
 If they fight for their rights, they are killed as Naxalites
 isiilie asur samaaj lagaataar taadaat main ghatata ja rahaa he 
 Reviewing Sanjeev's novel 'ghi Disha Dishi Isi Paar', the critic has uncovered the discoveries of biology expressed in the novel and the nexus of capitalism
 upanyaas kis tarah se poonjivadi tantra kii nirmam aalochana karata he or iskaa padhanaa kyon jaruri he
 Pandey writes, 'in the last few decades there have been unprecedented research and experiments in biology and their achievements are also unique
 is prakriya main ling parivartan, udhaar kii kokh , hormone therapy , chloning , test tub baby , kritim garbhaadhan , tishyu culture aadi kaa vartmaan poonjeevaad main vyapaar karne or laabh kamaane ke liye kitna or kaisaa vibhats durupyog kiya he
 If you want to know, then it is necessary to read the 'left direction is beyond this' and useful
 ’ aalochak ne upanyaas main abhivyakt vigyaan vimarsh ke saath-saath dharm , samaaj , itihaas or darshan ke vimarsh ko bhi jaancha-parkhaa he 
 Similarly, before 1857, there is a review article on Shaad Azimabadi's 'pir Ali' novel focusing on the reasons for the freedom movement and its realities
 mulat: urdu ke upanyaas par charchaa karte hue swayan aalochak ne 1857 ke vidroh ke bare main apane vichaar prakat kiye hai 
 Writing in his review article on the novel 'jahan Ek Jungle Tha' by the narrator Madan Mohan, he has been described as the author of Premchand's tradition
 is upanyaas main purvanchal ke ek adivasee samudaay kii jindagi kii tabaahiyon kii vyathaa-katha he, jinhen vanatangiya yaa vanavaasi kaha jaataa he
 'the history of torture of these tribals is long
 angrejon ke shasankaal main shuru hua yah shoshan bharat main bhi badastoor jari he
 Manager Pandey is a committed and enlightened critic
 unki kisi kitaab kii samiksha karnaa apane aap main chunauteepurn kaam he
 He is a master figure in both theory and practice
 unke yahaan ramchandra shukla kii bauddhik style or ramvilas sharma kii sookshm or sahajabodhgamy bhashaa kaa samavesh he
 However, she wrote in one place that 'democracy really came into the world of Hindi novels when women writers started analyzing and portraying male-power in their novels on the one hand and the story of the struggle of women on the other
 ’ alabatta unhone kisi bhi stri lekhika ke upanyaas kii samiksha nahin kii he
 Whatever the reason

 ) fifa world cap ke 21wein sanskaran ke group-i ke pehle mukaable main aaj shaam 5:30 baje se costa rika kaa saamana srbija se samaara arina main hoga
 Both teams do not have a single World Cup
 world cap main donon tiimon kaa pradarshan bhi niraashajanak rahaa he
 Going beyond the last-16 is a challenge for both teams
 fifa ranking main 25wein sthaan par maujuud costa rika captain bryan ruij or coach oskar romirej ke maargdarshan main team is baar apane pichley pradarshan se aage badhanaa chaahegi
 The team won the World Cup tickets by defeating Trinidad and Tobago and the United States in a match in the Concacaf World Cup qualifiers
 moscowh nashe main dhut taxi driver ne footbal premiyon ko ronda, 8 ghayaltim kii dephence behad majboot najar aa rahaa he or vah apane group main brazil jaise atake ko bhi mushkil main daal sakate hai
 The team's goalkeeper Keylor Navas, who plays Spanish club Real Madrid, will have his eyes on it while players such as Kendall Watson, Giancarlo Gonzalez and Johnny Acosta are looking strong
 navas toornament main team ke liye ahm sabit ho sakate hai
 The captain will be responsible for the team's attack on Ruiz, but the team will miss the good players in the forward line
 ruij costa rika ke liye 100 match khilne se maatr do match dur hai
 This will be his 99th match
 FIFA WC: pogba ke gol se france ne australia ko 2-1 se di matatim main koi sheersh stareey striker bhi nahin he jo world cap jaise bade toornament main costa rika ke liye chintaa kaa vishay he
 With both Joel Kampvel and Marco Yerena returning to the team after a striker injury, it will not be easy for them to strengthen the forward
 vahiin agar srbija kii baat kii jaae to wo 2014 main world cap se baahar rahane ke baad rus main aa rahi he
 The team finished last in their group in South Africa in 2010
 team is baar apane puraane pradarshan ko bhuulaakar aage badhanaa chaahegi
 The youth of the team is on the shoulders
 srbija kii takat midfield he jisamen sergez minulkovik, lagiyo par team kaa daaromadar he
 Apart from these two, the burden of winning the team will be on Alexander Mritovic
 team ke dephence ko bhi bhed paanaa kosta rika ke liye aasaan nahin hoga
 Navjot Singh Sidhu not named from Congress's star campaigner list, with former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Priyanka and Rahul Gandhi in the list of Congress's star campaigners for campaigning for Haryana Assembly elections have revealed two surprising things
 is list main kabhi star campaner rahe navjot singh siddhu kaa naam gaayab he
 Whereas, Ashok Tanwar, who has adopted rebel attitude, has been included in the list of star campaigners
 ajtak ne pehle hi bataa diya tha ki haryana congress ke aalaa netaa nahin chaahate ki navjot singh siddhu ko chunaav prachaar ke liye haryana bheja jaae kyonki aisa karne par rashtrawaad ke mudde par janata ko jawaab dena mushkil ho saktaa he
 The second surprising thing in the list is that Ashok Tanwar, who accused his party of selling tickets for Rs 5 crore, has been included in the list of star campaigners for the state
 star prachaarkon main 40 netiske alaava congress kii star campanners list main antarim adhyaksh sonia gandhi or purv adhyaksh rahul gandhi ke alaava purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh, priyanka gandhi, ashok gahalot, gulam nabi aaazaad, sachin payalat jaise netaaon ke naam shaamil hai
 The Congress has included 40 leaders among the star campaigners
 party kii ore se jari is list main saatven number par punjab ke mukhyamantri captain amarinder singh hai jabaki 12wein number par chhattisgarh ke mukhyamantri bhupesh baghel hai

 ashok tanvar ke baagi tevarlist jari hone se pehle haryana congress main mache bavaal ke bich congress netaa ashok tanvar ne party kii antarim adhyaksh sonia gandhi ko patr likhakar sabhi jimmedaariyon se mukt karne kaa anurodh kiya tha
 He said, 'I have sent a letter to Sonia Gandhi requesting relief from all the committees and responsibilities of the party
 haalanki main ek saadhaaran party kaaryakarta ke rup main kaam karnaa jari rakhuunga
 However, shortly after he resigned on Twitter, he announced that he is resigning from all party posts and will continue to serve the public through the party as a primary member
 isse pehleharyana congress ke sutron ke mutabik netaa navjot singh siddhu ko star prachaarkon kii list main nahin chaahate
 Many state leaders are believed to be the reason behind the loss of Rohtak Lok Sabha seat due to anti-pakistan slogans at Sidhu's public meeting in Rohtak and throwing of slippers at Sidhu by a woman during Lok Sabha elections
 unka maananaa tha ki unke aane se chunaav main asar pad saktaa he
 During US President Barack Obama's visit to India, the 'bottlenecks' have been removed to fully implement the indo-us nuclear deal
 aisa daawa kiya ja rahaa he or kaha ja rahaa he ki america raashtrapati baraak obama ne apane visheshadhikaron kaa istemaal karte hue bharat kii ore ek or kadam badhaayaa he taaki atomi deal ko puri tarah kriyanvit kiya ja sake lekin sawaal ab bhi bana he ki america companiyaan kya bharat ke saath ho rahi saudebaazi main apana nuksaan to nahin dekh rahi hai
 The indo-us nuclear deal was signed for nuclear energy so that India can use its uranium to produce electricity, these plants can be used in the country's progress
 bharat ke saath america qaraar mumkin karne ke liye america ne apane samvidhan kii adchanon ko paar karne ke liye disambar 2006 main ek kanoon paas karavaaya jise hide act kaha jaataa he
 After this, the nuclear deal was done, but the international organization that oversees more than two dozen reactor nuclear plants of India is under the supervision of IAEA
 duniya ke kai desh bharat ko ab bhi uranium kii supplai nahin kar rahe he
 India currently has two main problems with running nuclear power stations
 1) parmaanu eendhan yani uranium kii supplai 2) Purchase of nuclear reactors i
e
 nuclear furnaces america chahta tha ki vah jo uranium bharat ko supplai kare uske istemaal se lekar ri-cycling stage tak har vakt uski nigaraanee kaa adhikaar bhi use diya jaye
 India argues that the IAEA is already monitoring and it is unnecessary to monitor the US after giving fuel
 is bindu par kaha ja rahaa he ki america raashtrapati obama ne apni takat kaa istemaal kar bharat ko ye bharosa de diya he america sanyantron main istemaal ho rahe uranium kii nigaraanee kii maang nahin karegaa
 It is being called a major achievement in terms of India
 doosraa sawaal, parmaanu bijligharon ke liye bhattiyaan kharidne kaa he
 India's Nuclear Liability Act, enacted in 2010, states that compensation can also be sought from the company supplying these nuclear furnaces if there is an accident in the nuclear power plant and any fault in the nuclear reactor
 america companiyaan bhartiya kanoon ke is cloj ko maanane ko taiyaar nahin hai
 There were several rounds of discussion between the interlocutors of India and America
 kaha ja rahaa he ki ab muaavze kii raashi ko lekar ek vrihad fund banane kii baat hui he
 With the help of Indian insurance companies, a fund of 750 million rupees will be created, in which the Government of India will also deposit the same amount so that the funds can be arranged for the affected people in the event of an accident, but the question arises whether creating such a fund will help the Indian public
 Money not being used for compensation? The government has not officially given any blueprint in this regard, but one question is, will it be possible for India insurance companies to bear its economic burden? jaankaar kehete hai ki bhale hi is maamle main donon sarkaron ke str par ek kamyaabi hasil kar lee gai ho to bhi america companiyaan bharat ko parmaanu riyector bechengi isamen shaq he, kyonki in bhattiyon ko bechate vakt unhen muaavze ke liye premium kaa kuch hissaa zarur dena padegaa
 In such a situation, if American companies felt that the price of the deal was going to be very high, then they could retreat
 vaise ye baat bhi samajhane kii he ki rus or france jaise desh bharat ke libility kanoon se khush na hone baavjood hamen parmaanu riyector bechney ko taiyaar hai
 Then why are we facing pressure to buy reactors from American companies
 isaki vajah ye bhi he ki america ke saath hue parmaanu qaraar ke kuch samjhaute or bhi hue hai jinke tahat bharat ko america se agle kuch saalon main das hazaar megawatt ke parmaanu upkaran kharidne hai
 From this, the question arises that if companies do not sell nuclear reactors to India, will the deal be completed during the time of Dr
 Manmohan Singh government
 raajnneetik rup se bhi sarkaar ko is par pratirodh kaa saamana karnaa pad saktaa he kyonki vampanthi partiyaan to pehle se khulkar iskaa virodh kar rahi hai kuch sawaal congress or duusari partinya bhi uthaaengi
 The manner in which the BJP along with other parties had raised their voice in the Parliament during the UPA Government for a strong Liability Act is sure to raise the issue
 rajdhani dilli ke janpath road par sthit ambedkar international centre main 8 sitambar ko bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) ke kendriya padaadhikari party adhyaksh amit shah kaa intjaar kar rahe the
 The party general secretary and in-charge of various states stood there with details of the political situation and data of their respective states
 rashtriya kaaryakarini kii shuruyaat se pehle padaadhikariyon se charchaa kar shah yah tatolna chaah rahe the ki 2019 main party ke khilaaf mahagathbandhan kitna nuksaan pahunchane kii sthiti main he
 By the way, the officials were able to mention the challenge faced by the opposition alliance only in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Karnataka, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh
 iskaa zikr bhi aayaa ki 200 loksabhaa siton par mahagathbandhan main shaamil dalon kaa jaateey sameekaran bhaajapa ke liye chintaa kii vajah ban saktaa he
 After hearing this, Shah said in question, "can the traditional upper cast voters of the party get angry with the upper caste movement and go to the grand alliance's party?" haalanki is ashanka bhari khamoshi khud shah ne todaa or kaha, "2019 main pichhali baar se adhik vot or adhik seat bhaajapa ko milanaa tay he
 According to sources, Shah bluntly said in the meeting, "let us count the number of Brahmins, Dalits or backward in which Lok Sabha seat, whether it is the opposition party or the so-called Grand Alliance, let us only count that Modi government is running The benefits of the schemes reached to how many houses and where they have survived
 2019 bhaajapa ke liye cast (jati) kii nahin balki class (varg) kii ladaai he
 He gave the example of Gujarat and said that the caste figures appeared with the opposition in every election, but the aspiring class of every caste finally won the BJP
 darasal, pradhanmantri narendra modi ne party netaaon se jaateey voter kii jagah vargeey voter kii soch par kaam karne kaha tha
 In the 2017 National Executive meeting held in Delhi, the Prime Minister had said, "now bjp's voters will be poor
 ''unhone yah baat tab kahi thi jab notebandi ke kuch hi maheene beete the or party ke kai saansad is baat kii shikaayat kar rahe the ki notebandi kii vajah se bhaajapa kaa kor vot bank (vyavsaayee) party se chhitak gaya he
 The biggest challenge before Shah was the election of Uttar Pradesh
 2014 ke madhya se hi bhaajapa uttar pradesh main garibon ko sarkari yojanaon ko laabh pahunchane ke liye puri takat se juty thi
 In this, schemes like Ujjwala played an important role and BJP got success in the state
 sutron ke mutabik, shah ne padaadhikariyon ke saath baithak main iskaa zikr bhi kiya ki jis tarah se party ke andar or baahar se notebandi ke baad yah swar ubhar rahe the ki vyavsaayee varg bhaajapa se chhitak gaye hai, usee tarah kaa zikr ab kiya ja rahaa he
 On 20 March this year, after the Supreme Court's decision on the SC / ST Act, it was said that the community had fallen out of the BJP
 par karnataka chunaav main bhaajapa sabase badi party ban kar ubhari
 Now that the SC / ST Act was brought in the old form through Parliament, it is said that the upper castes will withdraw from the BJP
 shah ne spasht shabdon main party padaadhikariyon se kaha he ki jaateey ganit ko saadhane main urja lagane kaa koi matlab nahin he
 In the last nearly four and a half years, the votes of all castes have been received by BJP
 isaki mukhya vajah aspireshnal class kaa voter he
 This is the core vote of the BJP, which is necessary to ensure that these people get the benefit of the public welfare schemes of the Modi government of the Center and the BJP governments of the states
 sutron ke mutabik, shah ne pichley das saal main hue chunavi aankade kaa hawala dete hua kaha ki har chunaav main har dal ko har jati kaa vot miltaa rahaa he
 This will continue to happen
 unke mutabik, saamaanya ganit yah he ki beete kuch varshon main votaron kaa ek aisa tabaka ban gaya he jo sarkaron ke pradarshan ko dekhte hue vot karata he
 This section is the biggest strength of the BJP, which will dominate the caste arithmetic of the Grand Alliance
 haalanki congress kaa maananaa he ki vibhinn jatiyon kaa voter bhaajapa or uski sarkaar se naaraaz ho gaya he, isliye use aisi ranneeti banani pad rahi he
 Randeep Surjewala, head of the Congress media department, says, "actually BJP has come to know that every section of the society, irrespective of caste or class, has understood the politics of bjp's lies and BJP will get the answer in 2019
 
 har rajya main milegaa
 "it is therefore necessary that the aspiring Voterbhajpa assesses that in the event of a grand alliance, the party may have to suffer loss if it fails to practice caste mathematics
 khud party adhyaksh bhi pratyaksh or paroksh rup se maanate hai ki agar bhaajapa ke khilaaf sapa-basapa-congress or ralod milakar uttar pradesh main chunaav ladenge to bhaajapa ko nuksaan hoga
 But neither the party has so much time now, nor does the party have people who can connect different castes with the BJP, as Shah himself did in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections while being party general secretary and in charge of Uttar Pradesh
 
 unhone bhaajapa ko vibhinn jatiyon ke bich pahunchaa diya
 As a result, the party was able to win 71 of the state's 80 seats on its own
 aise main bhaajapa kii najar or ummid un logon par hai jo modi sarkaar ke kaaryon se labhanvit hue hai
 Shah says, "very soon, 10 crore families, ie about 50 crore people, will be brought under health protection under Ayushman Bharat, who will get free health insurance up to Rs 5 lakh
 apane mata-pita yaa parijanon ke swasthya ko lekar jo log chintit rahete hai chaahe ve kisi bhi jati ke hon unki ummid puri hogi
 People with such aspiration will vote for the BJP
 '' bhaajapa kaa kahana he ki mahagathbandhan ke ghatak dalon ke vot ek duusare ko transfar ho na ho lekin jinhen swasthya beemaa kaa laabh milegaa wo nishchit rup se usee dal ko praathamikta denge jis dal ne unki chahat puri kii he
 According to Shah, more than 50 crore people are already being benefited under more than 126 public welfare schemes
 ujjwala yojana ke tahat 5
 5 crore gas cylinders have been distributed
 samaaj kaa har vah tabaka jo lakdi ke chuulhe se mukti chahta tha unamem se zyaadaatar logon kii chahat puri hui he
 There is also a section of those who want a house, which consists of people of every caste
 modi sarkaar ne 1 karod gharon kaa nirmaan karaayaa he or bhaajapa is koshish main he ki saal 2022 tak sabhi ke paas apana ghar ho
 Electricity has been provided to 2
5 crore homes
 mishan indradhanush ke madhyam se 18 karod se adhik garib bacchon or garbhvatee mahilaon kaa tikaakaran kiya gaya he
 Seven public welfare schemes in 65 thousand villages are being run very successfully
 shah kaa kahana he, "2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav se pehle 1 lakh 20 hajaar gaanvon main in saaton lok kalyankari yojanaon ko sau fisadi kriyanvit karenge
 "but not easy," The RJP may be talking about class voters instead of caste, but the path of class vote bank is not easy
 aankade is baat kii gavaahi dete hai ki uttar pradesh main bhaajapa ne pichley loksabhaa chunaav main bhale hi badi safalataa hasil kii lekin agar sapa-basapa-congress or ralod kaa kul vot joda jaae to bhaajapa kii aspireshnal class voter kii soch kahin nahin thaharti
 42 in 2014 to BJP
 63 fisadi vot mili the jabaki sapa-basapa or congress ko mili vot agar jod die jaaen to yah bhaajapa se 6 fisadi adhik hote hai
 The situation is the same in Karnataka
 vahaan 2014 main bhaajapa 43 fisadi vot le gai thi jabaki congress or jad (es) kaa saajha vot share 52 fisadi ke lagbhag he
 The other important thing is that there are also many complaints about the public welfare schemes which are going against the BJP
 sabase safal rahi ujjwala yojana main ab logon ko silendar bharwane main pareshaani ho rahi he
 People do not have enough money to fill the gas cylinder again
 surajevaala kehete hai, "bhaajapa yadi aspireshnal class kii baat kar rahi he to us class ke logon ko jaraa samajhaae ki dijal-petrol kii keemat pehali baar sabase zyada oonchai par kyon he? gas ke silendar mahange kyon hai? notebandi se kya hua?rafel par chuppi kyon he? jiesti ke phaayde kya hue? petrol-dijal ke daam kam hon, kya yah aspireshnal varg kii chahat nahin he? kisaan aatmahatya na karen, kya yah sochane vaala varg samaaj main nahin he?'' jaahir he, bhaajapa bhale hi aspireshnal varg kaa daanv chal rahi ho, lekin uski raah aasaan nahin he

 If this does not happen again in the future, the content of the content will be repeated again
 After TTD, the TTD immediately removed the book from the website
 Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam (TTD) has issued an explanation for uploading some disputed excerpts of 'bhakti Geetamrit Lahiri' on its website
 
 titidi ne mana he ki uski website par hindu dharm ke alaava kisi anya dharm kii prashansa vaala contate aplod hua
 TTD has also assured that any content will now be properly examined before it is uploaded
 titidi ke kaaryakari adhikari anil kumaar singla ke mutabik ye pustak 2002 main prakashit hui thi or 2015 main aplod hui thi
 Singla said, 'the scheme for financial assistance to the authors started in May 1979 with clear guidelines from TTD
 maanak banaaya gaya ki is yojana ke tahat aane vaali kisi bhi kitaab ke pehle 16 pannon kii jaanch visheshgy samiti kii ore se karai jaaegi
 This committee consists of scholars from different languages
 bairiphication puraa hone ke baad 50% vittiya sahaayta lekhak ko di jaati he, saath hi 50 kitaaben titidi publications kii ore se bikri ke sweekaar kii jaati hai
 At that time, an expert committee made up of people with some big names from the field of literature had approved the grant of financial grant to the book (bhakti Geetamrit Lahiri) written by Menda Chinna Sitaramaiya
 kitaab 2002 main prakashit hui or i-publications ke tahat 2014-15 main hamaari website par aplod hui
 TTD immediately removed the book from the website after the controversy surfaced
 tirupati main thirumala sthit bhagwaan venkateshwar ke parvatiy tirth sthal kaa prabandhan karne vaale board ne dobaaraa bairiphication puraa hone tak website se un sabhi i-books ko hataane kaa faisla kiya jinhen sahaayta yojana ke tahat vitt anudaan mila tha
 Singla said that the verification work again will take a few months as the number of books is several thousand
 singla ke mutabik anudaan vaali kitabon ke liye maanak or dishanirdesh bhi sanshodhit kiye jaaenge jisase bhavishya main aisa koi vivaad saamne nahin aae
 Explain that this dispute came to light when a complaint was lodged before the Andhra Pradesh Chief Secretary and TTD Board that the Hindu temple board's website has a content-rich comment uploaded
 shikaayat main kaha gaya ki menda chinna sitaramaiya kii telegu kitaab ‘bhakthi gitamrita lahari’ main telegu kirthan main hindu devi-devataaon kii prashansa kii gai he
 But on page number 182, 183, 184 there are some kirtans praising Jesus Christ
 ye bhi kaha gaya ki titidi kii website par kitaab kii peedief copy aplod he
 This complaint was made by an NGO called 'law in Force'
 shikaayat ke baad website se peedief hataa lee gai
 The news of Alia Bhatt and Ranbir Kapoor's link-ups has swung the Gossip corridor
 or ho bhi kyon naa bollywood ke ye good looking or single stars ko ek saath relation main dekhnaa har koi chahta he
 Alia herself has expressed her crush on Ranbir
 ab ye jodi ek saath apakaming film brahmastra main saath najar aane vaali he or isi ke saath donon ke afaire kii khabaren bhi khub charchaaon main he
 During a chat show, designer Manish Malhotra recently revealed the link up pair of 2018, Alia and Ranbir
 is arbapati bijnesaman se judaa aalia kaa naam, aise hui thi mulakatahaalanki filmphere main aalia or ranbir ke relation ko lekar chhapi report ke mutabik in donon stars ke link ap kii afvaahon ke peeche diarector ayaan mukherjee ko kasuurvaar tehraaya ja rahaa he
 According to reports, the director of the film Brahmastra, Ayan Mukherjee, wanted Alia and Ranbir to spend more and more time with each other so that both of them become comfortable with each other for the film
 jisase ki in actors kii on screen chemistry natural najar aa sake
 Friend's advice to Alia- Stay away from Ranbir or else Dilshade will be broken because of this, Alia and Ranbir appeared together on events and outings on the day, and from here, discussions about their affair started
 aalia ke saath naam jode jane ko lekar ranbir bilkul khush nahin hai
 He also held a meeting with his team over the matter and ensured that he did not want the film to divert attention from rumors
 film brahmastra main aalia or ranbir ke alaava amitabh bachchan bhi ahm kirdaar main hai
 The shooting of this film is going to start next month
 is film kii saal 2019 main relies hone kii ummid he
 The England tour of India, which began with a three-day warm-up match played with Somerset on 15 July, will conclude on Friday at the Sofia Gardens ground in Cardiff
 is shrinkhalaa main bharat ne ab tak ek bhi antarrashtriya match nahin jeeta he
 She will be looking for this victory on Friday as it will work as an ointment on her wounds
 bharat ne england daure par chaar maichon kii test shrinkhalaa ke alaava ekmaatr twanti-20 match, do ekadivasiy match or ek abhyaas match ganvaaya he
 Of the nine international matches played so far, one has been canceled and one tie has taken place
 baaki ke saat main bhartiya team ko haar mili he
 In this sense, the Indian team has a chance to win in Cardiff to indicate that when the English team visits India next month, it will take a strong turn on it
 yah match bharat ke purv captain or uske sabase bharosemand ballebaajon main se ek rahul dravid ke liye khaas hoga kyonki iske madhyam se dravid ke antarrashtriya ekadivasiy kariyar par viraam lag jayega
 It was only after Dravid was selected in the ODI team after a gap of two years that his ODI career would end with five matches played with England
 dravid haalanki test team main bane rahenge
 What will happen in Cardiff cannot be said
 lords stadium main 11 sitambar ko khele gaye chauthe ekadivasiy mukaable main bhartiya ballebaaji main jo dhar dikhi thi, vah agar barkaraar rahi to bhartiya team ballebaajon ke dam par jeet sakati he lekin lakshya kii raksha karne kii baat ai to phir gendbaaj kaam kharaab kar sakate hai kyoki lords main unka pradarshan behad niraashajanak rahaa tha
 On the other hand, there is nothing to worry about the English team
 stuart broad ke chot ke kaaran baahar hone se beshak use kuch nuksaan hua he lekin isaki alpakaalik bharpai uske majboot bench strength se ho jaaegi
 In batting and fielding, the English team has been twenty compared to India so far and as far as bowling is concerned, it would be meaningless to compare between the two teams in this series
 apane gendbaajon ke dam par english team ne test shrinkhalaa jiti or ab ekadivasiy shrinkhalaa main badhat bana chuki he
 The Indian team has lost its chance to win the series
 aise main uske khilaadi bina kisi dar or bhay ke maidan main utarate hue apana shreshth pradarshan karnaa chahenge
 Parthiv Patel and Ajinkya Rehane have played a decent start to a large extent but the middle order has failed in the last three matches
 captain dhauni or suresh raina ne lords main apane balle kaa jo jor dikhaaya tha, use unhen jari rakhana hoga or saath hi viraat kohli ko bhi aage badhkar team ko majbootee pradaan kerani hogi
 Dravid will have the responsibility of playing a good innings in the final match and would like to bid him farewell with the win

 In response, CM Kejriwal told the Delhi Legislative Assembly that the target has been increased from 20,000 crores to 30,000 crores, but there will be no red nor any burden will be imposed on the traders, but only by talking to the traders and increasing the tax collection with the consent Will go

 yahi haalat is vakt pakistan ke pradhanmamantri navaj sharif kii he
 The biggest question before Nawaz Sharif is to make the person of his choice the next army chief of Pakistan
 isi mudde par navaj sharif or pakistan ke maujuuda senadhyaksh general raahil sharif ke bich rassakashi jari he
 General Raheel's term is going to be completed in November
 bharat kii ucchstareey intelegence reports ke mutabik navaj chaahate hai ki unka vishwaasapaatr afasar pakistani fouj kii kaman sanbhale
 At the same time, General Raheel insists that the officer of his choice be the next Army Chief
 pakistan main senadhyakshako power kaa ahm centre mana jaataa he
 The right to decide Pakistan's policy on India and America is considered in the hands of the current Chief of Army Staff, General Raheel
 general raahil kii pasand leftinent general juber mahmud hayaat hai
 Hayat is currently the Chief of General Staff in the Rawalpindi Army headquarters
 is post ko army chif kii post tak pahunchane ke liye ahm mana jaataa he
 Like Raheel, Hayat is also related to military clan
 hayaat ke teen bhai bhi pakistani fouj main ucch adhikari hai
 Prior to posting at the current post, Hayat had been the head of Pakistan's strategic plans division
 isi divijan ke upar pakistan ke parmaanu hathiyaaron kii dekh-rekh kii jimmedaari he
 What Lt
 General Hayat's vision for other countries is, is still hidden behind the scenes
 lekin bharat ke intelegence apretas kaa maananaa he ki maujuuda senadhyaksh general raahil se hayaat kahin zyada kattar hai
 Nawaz's choice is General Raheel's bet on Lieutenant General Javed Hayat, while Prime Minister Nawaz's choice is Lieutenant General Javed Ikbar Ramde
 raamde is vakt XXXI corps ke kor commander hai
 Please tell that Nawaz Sharif also made General Musharraf superceded by several generals and made him the Chief of the Pakistani Army
 lekin 1999 main general musharraf ne navaj sharif kaa takhtapalat kar khud hi pakistan kii hukumat sambhaal lee thi
 According to intelligence reports, the family of Lieutenant General Ramde has been associated with the Sharifaki Party Pakistan Muslim National League (PMNL) for many years
 general raamde kaa naam 2009 main surkhiyon main aayaa tha tab unhone afghanistan kii seemaa ke paas swat ghati main pakistani sena ke abhiyaan kaa netritv kiya tha
 According to the Intelligence Assessment of Racebharat in General nadeem-lieutenant General Bajwa, Nawaz Sharif has full faith in Lieutenant General Ramde
 pakistan kaa aglaa army chif koun banataa he, isi par bahut kuch aadhaarit rahegaa ki navaj kaa desh ke raksha or videsh maamalon par kisi pakad rahegi
 As far as the current Chief of Army Staff, General Raheel is concerned, he has been playing bets behind the scenes
 saath hi pakistan kii gharelu raajnneeti main bhi apni pakad lagaataar majboot karte rahe hai
 According to Indian intelligence reports, the names of two more lieutenant generals are being vied to become the Chief of the Pakistani Army
 ye hai leftinent general ishafa nadeem ahamed or leftinent general qamar bajva
 It is believed that if Nawaz and General Raheel do not agree on the name of the officer of their choice, then either one of the Lieutenant General Nadeem or Lieutenant General Bajwa can be approved to be the next Chief of Army Staff
 leftinent general nadeem is vakt multan main 2 corps ke kor commander hai vahiin leftinent general bajva pakistani fouj kii training or eveluation wing ko head kar rahe hai
 Talking of the last two army chiefs of Pakistan, both General Musharraf and General Kiani got an extension after the term ended
 pakistan ke maujuuda army chif general raahil saarvajanik taur par ye saaf kar chuke hai ki wo kaarykaal khatm hone ke baad vistaar lene ke icchhuk nahin he
 According to General Raheel, after retirement, he would prefer to stay in his ancestral home
 general sharif ke is stand ke baavjood pakistan main muhim jor pakad rahi he ki unhen kaarykaal main vistaar mili
 Of all the army chiefs that have been widely discussed in Rahilpakistan, General Raheel is promoted as the most popular
 general raahil ne pakistan kii sarkaar ke virodh ko darkinar kar khaybar pakhtoonkhwaa praant (north west frontier praant) main taharik-e-taliban ke aatankiyon ke khilaaf jarb-e-ajb oparation shuru kiya tha
 After this, # Thank You Raheel Sharif trend was on social media for several months
 bharat kii intelegence agenciyon kaa maananaa he ki general raahil ko lekar hip pakistani sena ke jan sampark wing kii ore se kiya gaya tha
 This wing is known as Inter Services Public Relations (ISPR)
 bharat main bhi general raahil kii sainik ke taur par nishtha kii tarif kii jaati he
 An officer posted in a high position in the Government of India told India Today / Aaj Tak, 'general Raheel is a professional soldier with strong feelings for nationality and his family's military heritage

 "sibiai pinjre main band tota ban gaya he, jo apane maalik kii bhashaa bolta he
 
 
 This parrot has many owners
 
 
 sibiai kya he - bure logon kaa sahyogi yaa jaanchakarta
 
 
 It is very sad that questions are being raised on the credibility of CBI
 
 
 15 saal pehle yah chattan jaisaa tha, ab ret jaisaa ho gaya he
 
 
 "this comment was made by the Supreme Court on 8 May 2013 about CBI Director Ranjit Sinha during the hearing of the coal scam cases
 
 
 supreme court is baat se naaraaz dikhi thi ki aakhir koyala ghotaale kii jaanch report sinha ne kanoonmantri or anya aalaa sarkari afasaron ko kyon dikhaai, jisase unhone jaanch report main badlaav karvaa liye
 
 
 While going, this 'parrot in a cage' got a shock from the Supreme Court again
 sevanivritti se thik 12 din pehle supreme court ne ranjit sinha ko 2-ji spectrum maamle se khud ko alag rakhane kaa nirdesh diya
 
 
 According to the visitor's diary, the court gave this instruction after disclosure of 90 visits of Ranjit Sinha to the accused
 
 
 yah pehali baar nahin thi, jab ranjit sinha ko kisi jaanch se hataaya gaya tha
 
 
 Earlier in 1996, the Patna High Court also separated him from the investigation into the fodder scam, as he was accused of helping Lalu Prasad Yadav
 
 
 kaha gaya tha ki sinha ne lalu yadav kii khatir jaanch report hi badal daali he
 
 
 Questions have been raised from time to time on the working style of the CBI director
 
 
 kabhi khud, kabhi aakaaon ke dabaav main aakar unhone kai baar jaanch ko prabhavit kiya
 
 
 Former CBI director Joginder Singh said that he was under pressure to slow the investigation against Lalu Yadav
 
 
 bhopal gas traasadee kii jaanch kar rahe purv diarector biaar laal ne aarope lagaaya tha ki unase traasadee ke mukhya aaropee union carbide corporation ke chairman warren anderson ke pratyrpan ke liye dabaav nahin banane ke liye kaha gaya tha
 
 
 The CBI was also accused of helping Ottavio Quattrocchi, the main accused in the Bofors scandal
 
 
 centre kii tatkaaleen sarkaar ne kis tarah sibiai kaa durupyog kar mulaayam singh yadav or mayawati kaa samarthan hasil kiya tha, yah aarope bhi bahut lambey arase tak charchaa main rahe the
 
 
 Despite two years of job security, why do CBI directors come under pressure
 
 
 ? kaaran ek hi he, sibiai swatantra sanstha nahin he
 
 
 CBI is neither constitutional nor statutory
 
 
 yah carmik or prashikshan vibhaag ke adheen kaam karti he
 
 
 This means that the Department of Personnel and Training has the authority to appoint, transfer and suspend CBI officers, and of course, the department will be headed by a minister
 
 
 aise main swaabhaavik he ki sibiai kaa diarector apane bos ke prabhaav main aayega hi
 
 
 Sometimes, after retirement, they lose their longing for good positions
 
 
 kismat acchhee hui to kisi rajya ke governor tak ban jate hai
 
 
 On 8 May 2013, the Supreme Court warned the government that if the government does not make the CBI independent, the court will have to intervene
 
 
 court ne kaha tha ki 15 saal puraane vineet narayan cese ke samay sibiai kii swaittata ke maamle main court ne jo faisla diya tha, us par centre ne abhi tak kuch kiya kyon nahin he
 
 
 After the court rebuke, the UPA government also formed the Group of Ministers, but the matter remained stuck on the formation
 
 
 supreme court kii tipanni ko dedh saal ho chukaa he, lekin tota kal bhi pinjre main tha, aaj bhi he
 
 
 Even though one parrot retired today and got freed, it is also certain that another parrot will come tomorrow
 
 
 darasal, tote badalane se behatar he, intazaar karnaa - pinjre ke tuutane kaa, or tote ke azaad ho jane kaa
 
 
 In the 51-year history of the CBI, his credibility has been questioned many times, but this is the first time that the Supreme Court has repeatedly accused the director of the CBI
 
 
 use kisi jaanch se alag kiya gaya ho
 
 
 Today was Ranjit Sinha's last day as CBI Director
 
 
 jane kaa unhen dukh to hoga, lekin is baat kii khushi bhi hogi ki ab vah phir court ke aage beizzat nahin honge
 
 
 There is a lot of talk in the industry about Modi government being awarded Bharat Ratna to Hindi cinema veteran Dilip Kumar
 is sammaan ko lekar chal rahi khabaron ke mutabik,dilip kumarurf usoof khan ko modi sarkaar desh ke sarvocch sammaan bharat ratna se sammanit karne kii taiyaari main he
 It is believed that by giving Bharat Ratna to Dilip Kumar, the Modi government is looking to improve its image among the Muslim community
 93 saal kedilip kumaaraki tabiyat philhal thik nahin hai
 In this regard, if the government declares him Bharat Ratna, then the question will also come to the fore whether he will be able to come from Mumbai to Delhi to get this honor
 charchaa yah bhi he kibimarike chalate agar dilip kumaar dilli nahin aa pate hai, to unhen unke ghar par hi is aword se sammanit kiya ja saktaa he
 Earlier also, former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had been honored by President Pranab Mukherjee with the Bharat Ratna at his home
 dilip kumaar ko saal 1991 main 'padam bhushan', saal 1994 main 'dada sahab phalke' aword or 2015 main'padam vibhushan'aword se nawaja ja chukaa he
 Abhash Sharma, a resident of Jaipur city, has passed the 12th examination
 ab aap soch rahe honge ki isamen aisa nayaa kya he
 After all, lakhs of students across the country pass the 12th examination every year
 lekin jaan len ki abhas mahaj 12 saal ke hai or itani kam umr main aisa karnama karne vaale ve pehle student hai
 Abhas has got 325 numbers in the 600 number examinations and thus he has secured 65 per cent marks
 bataa den ki is honhaar chaatr ne abhas public skool, durgapura se padhai kii he jise rajasthan madhyamik shiksha board se manyata mili hui he
 This school is also named after him because his father Sachin Sharma is the owner of this school
 kaha jaataa he ki yahaan inhen kaksha 1 main daakhila diya gaya or kaksha 2 ke baad ve sidhe kaksha 5 main jump kar gaye
 Abhash is seen as a celebrity between the whole school and the community
 unhone mahaj 10 saal main 10veen kii pariksha paas kar lee thi
 He wants to become a doctor in future
 doctor banane or embibies karne main hai kai pachade
 
 
 Even though they have passed the 12th examination at the age of 12, the minimum age to take the AIPMT / NEET examination is 17 years and they are 5 years behind this age limit
 aise main unke parents isparisthitise nibatane ke liye kanoonee salaah le rahe hai
 Can do graduation and post graduation before MBBS
 
 
 vaise to abhas ke mata-pita har sambhav koshish kar rahe hai ki vah AIPMT / NEET kii entrens pariksha dekar MBBS main daakhila le len
 If this is still not possible, then they will enroll in a bachelor's in a nearby college and in the meantime they will do graduation and post graduation from there
 itnaa kuch jaanane ke baad to ham ab abhas se sirf yahi sawaal poochna chaahate hai ki is raftaar se degree hasil karke kya karne kaa iraadaa he? kya mangal par jaaoge? There was a sharp altercation between BJP MP Meenakshi Lekhi and Canadian writer of Pakistani origin Tariq Fateh at an event here on Monday

 Here he was to meet journalism students on the subject of 'journalism and Indian Democracy'
 minakshi lekhi ne is maukey par apane sambodhan main kaha ki media kaa kaam massenger ke naate sirf sach dikhaanaa he
 He also accused the journalists of corruption and printing of Arngal news against him
 saamaajik kaaryakarta or lekhak madhu kishwar ne bhi media kii bhoomika par kataaksh karte hue kaha ki patrkaar rajanetaaon se laabh lete hai isliye vah tatasth na hokar pakshpaati khabaren dikhaate hai
 Tariq Fateh was agitated after hearing such allegations on the media
 unhone minakshi lekhi kii ore rukh karte hue kaha ki ve peshey se vakil hai
 The lawyers also defend the murderer on receiving the money
 aisa hi ve media ke bare main sochati hai, jo saraasar galat hai
 Tariq Fateh said- 'the image of the Indian media is very clear and it is among the top 10 countries in the world
 yahaan chaatro ko kuch sakaaratmak bataaya janaa chahie tha lekin ye log puure patrakarita jagat ko bhrasht bataa rahe hai jis par mujhe gussa aa rahaa he
 Meenakshi Lekhi objected to interrupting Tariq Fateh during his address
 minakshi ne kaha ki unhen itnaa shishtachar to dikhaanaa chahie ki koi bol rahaa ho to bich main nahin bolnaa chahie
 According to Meenakshi, Tariq Fateh was interrupting when both he and Madhu Kishwar spoke
 uttar pradesh kii purv mukhyamantri or bahujan samaaj party (basapa) kii adhyaksh mayawati ne buudhvaar ko samaajawaadee party (sapa) kii sarkaar par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki musalamaanon ko aabaadi ke aadhaar par aarakshan dilaane kaa shigupha chhedane vaali sapa keval muslim samaaj ko dhokhaa dene kaa kaam kar rahi he
 Mayawati said, 'the SP had said in its election manifesto that like Dalits, Muslims will be given 18 percent reservation on the basis of population
 lekin sarkaar abhi tak apana vaada puraa nahin kar pai he
 Mayawati said that sp's intention is not to give reservation to Muslims, but only to gain votes by making hollow promises
 sapa ke apane log hi ab use aarakshan sambandhit vaade kii yaad dilaa rahe hai
 Mayawati said that Syed Ahmed Bukhari, the royal imam of Jama Masjid, had also reminded the government of its promise in the past
 unhone kaha ki sapa ke 10 maheene ke kaarykaal main soobe main chaaron taraf keval araajaktaa or lut kaa mahaul kaayam he
 Along with SP, Mayawati strongly criticized the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government at the Center
 mayawati ne kaha, 'aabaadi ke hisaab se desh ke sabase bade rajya main sapa kaa 10 maheene kaa kaarykaal har str par vifal sabit hua he
 The government has surpassed its previous record in cases of murder, robbery and rape
 'unhone kaha, 'upra main chaaron taraf araajaktaa kaa maahaul he
 The governance and administration system has completely collapsed
 puure rajya main sapa ke gundon evam mafiaon kii tuuti bol rahi he
 How can a government be imagined to run a good government with a party full of goons
 'purv mukhyamantri ne kaha ki jab pradesh kaa mukhyamantri hi hatotsahit karne vaala bayaan de rahaa ho to sthiti kaa andaja lagaaya ja saktaa he
 Mayawati said that Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav had said in Varanasi that should i wear uniform myself to improve the law and order of the state
 mukhyamantri ke is tarah ke bayaan ke baad unki laachaari ko samajha ja saktaa he
 Mayawati said that out of 48 ministers of the present government of the state, 26 people are facing criminal cases
 jab mantrimandal main itane bhrasht or aapraadhik pravriti ke mantri shaamil hon to kanoon-vyavastha kii sthiti kaise sudhar sakati he
 Taking a dig at the UPA government at the Center besides SP, Mayawati said that the Congress' plan is not to pass the reservation bill in promotion
 isiilie usne is vidheyak ko loksabhaa main lataka diya
 In the Delhi rape case, Mayawati said that mere condemnation and condolence of the incident will not stop the harassment of women
 balki iske liye sarkaar ko chahie ki vah logon se salaah mashvira kar kade kanoon banaae

 team india ke captain or ranchi sthit saint jevirs college ke student mahendra singh dhoni kii kismat main shoharat or paisa to bahut he, lekin lagata he, unki kismat main graduate kahlaana nahin he
 
 
 In fact, the college is distributing degrees among the students of the year 2011 on Monday, but due to not being able to pass a single semester, Dhoni's name is not in the list
 
 
 so, dhoni phir bachaler kii degree paane se vanchit rah gaye
 
 
 It is worth mentioning that Mahendra Singh Dhoni passed the Inter examination in Commerce from Gosner College in Ranchi after passing 10th standard from Ranchi Jawahar Vidya Mandir, Shyamali, but due to his career in cricket, he could not pursue further studies
 
 
 tab saat-aath saal ke antaraal ke baad unhone varsh 2008 main ranchi sthit saint jevirs college main vokational studies ke tahat offis administration and secreterial practice course main bachaler kii degree paane ke liye (paathyakram 2008-2011) daakhila liya tha, lekin cricket main ati vyastata kii vajah se vah chah main se ek bhi cemester paas nahin kar paae
 
 
 The comments ab dhoni shaayad graduate ho hi nahin paaenge, kyonki unka registration bhi is saal khatm ho jayega
 
 
 By the way, Xavier's College had given all the facilities to Dhoni
 
 
 masalan, unke liye college aana anivaary nahin tha, or vah apni suvidhanusaar kahin se bhi pariksha de sakate the, lekin mahendra singh dhoni ne chah main se kisi ek cemester main bhi pariksha nahin di
 
 
 When Dhoni was spoken to Xavier College Principal Father Nicholas Tete, he said that it would have been a great pleasure if Dhoni were also part of this list of graduates
 
 
 jevirs college ke baaki chaatro ko bhi is baat kaa malaal zarur he ki bhartiya captain kaa naam unke saath is list main nahin he, lekin unhen is baat kii khushi bhi he ki dhoni desh-videsh main desh kaa naam roshan kar rahe hai

 Now Dhoni might not be able to graduate, because his registration will also end this year
 
 
 vaise jevirs college ne dhoni ko sabhi tarah kii suvidhaayen de rakhi thim
 
 
 For example, it was not compulsory for him to come to college, and he could take the exam from anywhere as per his convenience, but Mahendra Singh Dhoni did not appear in any of the six semesters
 
 
 jab dhoni ke bare main jevirs college ke principal fadar nicholas tete se baat kii gai, to unhone kaha ki agar dhoni bhi graduates kii is suchi kaa hissaa hote to kaaphi khushi hoti
 
 
 The rest of the students of Xavier's College are also sure that the name of the Indian captain is not with them in this list, but they are also happy that Dhoni is illuminating the name of the country in India and abroad

 ' The sequel to 'the Kapil Sharma Show' is to be shot on April 2, but it is still not clear whether Dr Moushul Gulati (sunil Grover), Nani (ali Asgar) and Chandu Chaiwala (chandan Prabhakar) will be seen in it
 sutron ke mutabik sthiti aisi he ki kamedian kapil sharma or unke 'da kapil sharma sho' donon kaa hi bhavishya jatil bana hua he
 On a recent Air India flight returning from Melbourne (australia) to Mumbai, Kapil's alleged misbehavior was reported along with his team members, including Sunil Grover
 tabhi se 'da kapil sharma sho' ke liye gambhir sthiti bani hui hai
 Kapil's production house is trying its best to make Sunil Grover, Ali Asgar and Chandan Prabhakar return before the shooting of the April 2 episode
 'da kapil sharma sho' to aayega lekin dekhnaa ye hoga ki kya sho main parform karne vaale actors main badlaav hoga?kapil se ladaai ke baad sunil kaa nayaa twitabata den ki soni channel par 'da kapil sharma sho' beete saal 24 april ko shuru hua tha
 But before the first anniversary this serious crisis arose for the show
 sho ke ek or ahm kirdaar navjot singh siddhu bhi apni raajnneetik patibaddhtaon main ati vyast main hai
 In such a situation, there is a question mark on Sidhu's participation in the next shoot of the show
 kapil khud bhi is vakt apni produs kii hui film 'firangi' kii shooting ke liye desh se baahar hai
 He will return only on 2 April
 bataaya jaataa he ki sunil grover, ali asagar or chandan prabhakar teenon hi kapil kii ore se flite main kii duusare yatriyon ke saamne kii gai kathith badasluki se khafa hai
 Although Kapil has also apologized on social media, but these three actors are not ready to return to the shooting again
 kapil ke sho main nahin aae bollywood sitare, shoot hua cancilasho ke duusare actor kiku sharada or sugandha mishra bhi flite main maujuud the
 While Kiku has said that Kapil has apologized, Sugandha has not commented yet
 shanivaar ek april ko sho kii jo kadi prasaarit kii jaaegi wo pehle se shoot he
 In this, Kapil will be seen re-union with his old colleagues of Great Indian Laughter Challenge
 ravivaar do april ko indian idal kaa final prasaarit hona he isliye 'da kapil sharma sho' kaa us din prasaaran nahin hoga
 But with this, the producers of the show for next week's episodes are not sure what will happen
 aise hi chalata rahaa to barbaad ho jayega kapil sharma kaa sho!bataaya ja rahaa he ki philhal krishna abhishek, sudesh lahiri, raju shrivastav, rajeev thakur, sunil paal, ehsaan kuraishi ke saath baatcheet kii ja rahi he
 So that the shortage of Sunil Grover, Ali Asgar, Chandan Prabhakar can be filled
 pichley hafte 'da kapil sharma sho' kii jo kadi prasaarit hui thi usamen raju shrivastav, sunil paal or ehsaan kuraishi guest ke taur par dikhaai die the
 The same sequence can also be seen in the next few weeks
 
 
 
 When Kapil Sharmaye arrived at Shahrukh's party unannounced, it is surprising that Krishna Abhishek, who was once considered a rival to Kapil Sharma, can also be seen sharing screen space with Kapil in his show
 color channel par kapil sharma kaa sho 'kamedi nits vid kapil' band hone ke baad krishna ko lekar 'kamedi nits' shuru kiya gaya tha
 It is believed that efforts are being made by Sony channel to bring in better comedians from the industry to compensate Sunil Grover
 kapil kaa sho karne ke baad, sunil ke liye ye bole ehsaan kurashifilhal team soni or kapil sharma kii production team kii ore se sunil grover se baatcheet jari he jisase ki unhen sho main waapas laayaa ja sake
 In such a situation, Sunil Grover may approve to return to the show with his own conditions
 isi tarah duusare actors ko bhi manaane ke prayaas kiye ja rahe hai
 But with this, work is also being done on a back up plan in which shoots with other actors can be done
 sthiti zyada hi vikat hui to bank kiye hue episod ko dikhaaya ja saktaa he
 There are also reports that all this may be a prank of April Fool from the team
 baharhaal jo bhi ho da kapil sharma sho chalata rahegaa lekin darshakon ko aane vaali kadiyon main content ke str par kaaphi badlaav dekhne ko mil sakate hai
 This situation is likely to remain in place until the channel and the producers resolve the clutches

 More than 4000 people from India worked in Yemen
 inamen se kai to vahaan dashakon se rah rahe the
 Most of the Indians were living in Yemen's capital city of Sanaa and in the surrounding areas, where conditions were worst
 kharaab halaat ko dekhte hue sarkaar ne 30 march ko bharatiyon ko nikaalane kaa aadesh jari kar diya tha
 Naval warship INS Sumitra, which was in the Gulf of Aden at the time, arrived first to help the people

 In view of the bad situation, the government had issued an order to expel the Indians on 30 March

 The BJP and the ruling Aam Aadmi Party have come face to face for taking credit on unauthorized colonies in Delhi
 anaadhikrut coloniyon ko lekar ek baar phir bijepi ne kejariwal ko jhuuthon kaa sardaar bataa diya
 Actually, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had announced on Thursday at a press conference that now people will be able to register in unauthorized colonies too
 bijepi ne kejariwal ko jhootha qaraar dete hue aarope lagaaya ki aap sarkaar ne apane chaar saal ke kaarykaal main anaadhikrut coloniyon ko lekar kuch nahin kiya
 But when the Modi government insisted on this and it became possible only due to the policies of the Central Government, then they went to take credit themselves
 pradesh bijepi adhyaksh manoj tiwari ne kaha, 'siem arvind kejariwal anaadhikrut colony ko lekar bhram failaa rahi he
 While it is the Modi government, which has taken many decisions to get the ownership of it, worrying the people of these colonies
 jise kejariwal apana prayaas bataakar credit lene ke liye anaap-shanaap bayaan de rahe hai
 Accusing Kejriwal, Manoj Tiwari said, "even after 4 years after the Modi government gave an ultimatum to repeatedly survey unauthorized colonies, the Kejriwal government could not even reply
 saath hi centre sarkaar ne in colony ke vikaas ke liye jo fund relies kiya, usamen kejariwal sarkaar pichley 4 saal main 29% bajet kaa paisa kharch nahin kar pai he
 Manoj Tiwari said that the order of border banning of these colony was passed in 2008 itself
 lekin aaj tak shila sarkaar se kejariwal sarkaar tak 11 saal biit gaye
 Even then the border work could not be completed
 iskaa bhi jawaab kejariwal ko dena chahie

The Congress won four seats and the Congress could not win a single seat
 dhing kii raily main ajmal darasal ek dashak baad gogoi ke kataaksh kaa jawaab de rahe theah 2005 main eiudief kii sthapana kiye jane ke maukey par mukhyamantri ne sawaal kiya tha, ''badaruddin ajmal he koun?ʼʼ2004 main gathan ke baad se hi bodo partiyon ke varchasv vaali 40 sadasyon kii council main chaar siten jeetna bhale hi naakaafi ho, lekin 2009 se dhubri ke saansad ajmal ke paas shekhi baghaarne kii apni vajahen hai
 The first is that the AIUDF fielded only eight candidates - four Muslims and four Bodos - compared to their opponents across the state, of whom two Muslims and two Bodos won, while contesting more than 35 seats
 Despite this the Congress could not win a single seat and the BJP had to settle for only one seat
 doosraa, bodoland teritorial aria districts (beatiedi) main (jahaan bodo or muslim apravasiyon ke bich hinsak jhadpen is ilaake main maano saamaanya baat ho gai hai) siten jeetne kaa siyaasi mahatv he, kyonki isse unke muslim apravasiyon ke ''mahaan rakhwaleʼʼ hone ke daawey ko bal miltaa he
 Hojai, or Ajmal, who was born in Assam and runs a vast business of clothing, real estate, leather, healthcare, education and perfumes in Mumbai (see box), is now eyeing Assam's assembly elections next year
 guwahati uniwarsity main raajnneeti shaastra padhaane vaale nani gopal mahant kehete hai, ''congress or bijepi, donon ke spasht bahumat hasil karne kii sambhaavna nahin he, aise main ajmal kaa kingmekar kii bhoomika nibhaana tay he
 Apart from his political acumen behind Ajmal's tremendous rise, the situation also has a significant contribution
 eiudief 2005 main gathit kii gai thi, usee saal supreme court ne vivaadaaspad avaidh apravasi (tribunel dwaara nirdhaaran) kanoon (iemditi) ko radd kar diya tha
 For this, the decision of the court came after a long legal battle was fought by Sarbananda Sonowal, the leader of All Assam Students Union and the current Union Minister of BJP
 iemditi kanoon ne avaidh apravasiyon kii pahchaan kii jimmedaari nyaayaadhikrnon par daal di thi or sandigdh logon kii naagarikta ko sabit karne kaa bhaar shikaayat karne waalon par daal diya tha
 The immigrant Muslims believe that this law made by the then Congress government at the center was to protect them from persecution
 2011 main baraak ghati kii yatra main mukhyamantri gogoi ne kaha ki ve ''hindu apravasiyonʼʼ kii hifaazat karenge
 This gave Ajmal a chance to stand up for Muslim immigrants
 2006 ke chunaav main eiudief ko keval 10 siten mili thim, lekin 2011 ke chunaav main usne banglabhashi, muslim bahut nirvachan kshetron main 18 siten bator leen
 With this, the party emerged as the main opposition party in the politics of Assam
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main usne teen siten jeetin or 24 vidhansabha kshetron main badhat kaayam kii, jabaki 2009 main uske paas keval ek seat thi
 On 20 April, Gogoi said to compensate for the loss, Bangladeshis who had illegally entered Assam should be given citizenship of India due to bad conditions
 lekin mahant kehete hai, ''iemditi kanoon ko nahin bachaa paane or beatidie main baar-baar hone vaale katleam ko rokane kii garaj se samuchit kadam nahin uthaane ke liye musalmaan congress ko kabhi maaf nahin kar sakate
 Ajmal rejects allegations that his party protects the interests of a particular community
 apane daawey ke samarthan main ve aankade pesh karte hai
 In 2006, the AIUDF fielded 73 candidates, of whom 34 were non-muslims
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main eiudief ne 11 siton par chunaav ladaa, jinamein se chah gaiyr-musalmaan ummidavaar the
 One of the three winning candidates is Radheshyam Biswas Hindu

 Aditya Langthasa Dimasa is a tribal
 lekin ajmal ke samaveshi hone kaa daawa alpsankhyak card khilne ke unke ravaie se mail nahin khaataa
 His latest target is the process of updating the National Citizenship Register, which was launched in April
 barpeta jile ke howali main ek raily main unhone garajte hue kaha, ''yah assam main 40 lakh musalamaanon ko gaiyrkanoonee naagarik banane kii sajeesh he
 The Supreme Court has given the state government till December 2016 to complete the work of the National Citizenship Register and the assembly elections are also due by the end of 2016
 isliye chunavi bisaat par naagarikta register ko apadet karne kaa mudda jor-shor se mandaraata dikhaai de rahaa he
 The 2011 census religious figures have added to this
 in aankadon ke mutabik assam main musalamaanon kii aabaadi main sabase tej badhotaree hui he
 Where it 30 in 2001
 9 fisadi thi, vahiin ab badhkar 34
 2 percent, while Muslims across the country 13
 4 fisadi se 14
 There is a slight increase of 2 per cent (see map)
 daarul ulum devband se fajil (islamic dharamshastra or arabi main master degree ke baraabar) moulana ajmal siyaasi guna-bhaag acchhee tarah samajhate hai or musalamaanon ko rijhaane ke liye apane tarkash ke har tir kaa istemaal karte hai
 It also includes giving his followers "hakimi Pani" (the water in which they spit)
 unke samarthakon kaa daawa he ki is pani ko pine se har beemaari thik ho jaati he
 When Ajmal was asked why he spread superstition, he said to his small office in Colaba in Mumbai, "when the government has failed to provide treatment to the people, if i can help them with Allah's Fazl Have been, so what is wrong with it? If i were fooling people, why would they have come to me well? ʼʼ Kamal Medhi of Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti, an NGO fighting for the rights of farmers, says, "people often complain that the AIUDF MLA is about development
 They don't do any work, but as soon as Ajmal comes to pray, they forget everything
 ham siyasatdan kaa to muqabla kar sakate hai, magar apane kaam kii bajaae majahab se logon par apana asar kaayam karne vaale moulana se ladanaa badi chunauti he
 His detractors also believe that Ajmal has a magical hold on Muslims troubled by poverty in rural areas of lower Assam
 ve jamiat ulema-e-hind, marakajul maariff or haji abdul majid memorial public trust jaise kai sanghathanon se jude hue hai or unka foundation rajya bhar main kai skool, madrase, aspataal or anathalay chalaata he
 Political analyst Dilip Chandan says Ajmal can win 30 seats as well, although he also adds the condition that, "he will have to rein in the emerging opposition against his dynastic politics and at least six seats for his mlas
 Will have to fight the feelings created by the inaction of
 ʼʼ party main is baat ko lekar virodh ke swar uthte rahe hai ki aksar ''hujurʼʼ kahkar sambodhit kiye jane vaale ajmal eiudief ko paariwarik jaagir kii tarah chalaa rahe hai

 After 2016, Ajmal's status will also be determined by how the BJP performs in the elections
 2011 main bijepi ne paanch vidhansabha siten jiti thim, lekin 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main ''modi laharʼʼ ne rajya kii 14 siten uski jholii main daal deen, jo usne pehle kabhi nahin jiti thim, or saath hi use 69 vidhansabha kshetron main badhat dilaa di
 This February, he won 38 of the 74 municipal boards and town committees in the state
 bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne 26 april ko guwahati main ek raily main sanket diya ki party hindu voton ko ekajute karegi-unhone ''bangladeshi hindu apravasiyonʼʼ ko naagarikta dene kaa vaada kiya or kaha ki ''is baar assam ke chunaav rajya ko gaiyrkanoonee bangladeshi apravasiyon se aaazaad karne ke liye honge
 चुनौती The challenge of the party is that its appeal is quite limited
 bijepi ke ek varisht netaa kehete hai, ''30 muslim bahul siten hai; 15 siten congress kaa garh hai or 12 siton par bodo-varchasv vaali partiyaan jeetengi
 Our fate rests on 69 seats, where we can compete strongly
 ʼʼsitambar 2014 main sirajuddin ne elaan kiya tha ki unke bhai ''jaldi hiʼʼ assam ke mukhyamantri banenge
 This big brother's dream may not be fulfilled in 2016, but he can definitely play the role of kingmaker
 apane paanse ve bakhubi chal rahe hai
 If he had supported UPA-2, it would not have taken much time to support the NDA by changing the lines after the general election; If he has good relations with Sonia Gandhi's political secretary Ahmed Patel, then Narendra Modi is also his "elder brother"
 ajmal ne india today se kaha, ''ham chunaav ke pehle congress or bijepi donon se baraabar duuri banaakar rakhenge
 But after the election, we will not run any party as untouchable for the sake of giving a stable government to the state

 ye ghoshnaa kai khilaadiyon ke liye khushkhabari lekar to ai to kaiyon ko niraashaa haath lagi
 The selection of the team to date will be the most disappointing of Yuvraj Singh of India, Dwayne Bravo of West Indies and Kieron Pollard
 vaise hataash england ke purv captain elistare cook bhi honge, jinhen team se hi baahar kaa rasta dikhaa diya gaya
 They had to pay for the poor performance
 yuvaraj ko nahin chune jane ke faisle se unke prashansak naaraaz hue
 It is speculated that Dwayne Bravo and Pollard have been sentenced to leave India midway due to a contract dispute with the cricket board
 aaie ek najar daalate hai aise kuch cricketron par
 
 
 1
 yuvaraj singhranji trophy main punjab ke liye teen shatak jadne ke baad yuvaraj singh ko team main chune jane ko lekar ummiden jag gai thim
 It was felt that with the return to form, his team will also return
 vaise world cap ke liye chune gaye 30 sambhavit khilaadiyon main unka naam to nahin tha, lekin rabindra jadeja ke chotil hone kii vajah se isaki sambhaavnaaen bad gai thim
 But Yuvi and cricket fans felt disappointed
 chayankartaaon ne team ke bhavishya kii daleel ko dhyaan main rakhte hue unhen mauka nahin diya
 Let me tell you that Yuvraj Singh was the Player of the tournament in the last World Cup
 2
 Dwayne Bravo It is only a few months ago when Dwayne Bravo was captaining the West Indies ODI team
 olerounder ke taur par bhi vah team kii pehali pasand the
 But he had to bear the brunt of a contract dispute with the West Indies Cricket Board
 unke adiyal ravaiye se naaraaz board ne unhen team se baahar kaa rasta dikhaakar bataa diya ki asli bos koun he
 Let us tell you that due to the payment dispute, the West Indies team returned to India leaving the tour midway

 Kieron Pollard This explosive batsman may not have done anything special with the bat or ball in the last 6 months, but no one would want to make the mistake of ignoring a talented player like him in the World Cup
 par vah westeindies team kaa hissaa nahin he
 He seems to have suffered the brunt of supporting the Braves in the contract dispute
 4
 Jimmy neeshamnew Zealand Cricket Board selectors showed greater confidence in Grant Eliot as the all-rounder in the team, replacing Jimmy Neesham
 chaunkaane vaali baat yah he ki aliot ne apana aakhri vanade match 2013 main khelaa tha
 At the same time, Neesham continued to be a part of the Kiwi team
 is dauraan unhone kuch achche pradarshan bhi kiye
 But Eliot's claim to the board was stronger
 5
 Kamran Akmal: Wicketkeeper Kamran Akmal, who has been behind the wicket for Pakistan for a long time, is probably at the last stage of his career
 unhen ummid hogi ki pisibi world cap jaise ahm toornament main unke anubhav ko tarjeeh degaa
 But the performance of current wicketkeeper Sarfraz Ahmed has not been so bad that Kamran is given his place in the team
 6
 It is a surprising decision not to include Ryan Harris, Ryan Harris, as this fast bowler has performed tremendously in recent times
 shaayad fitness unke world cap khilne ke liye sapane ke aade aa gai
 Chief selector Rod Marsh said he could use 35-year-old Harris as a trump card for next month's World Cup but wants the fast bowler to be fully fit for the next Ashes series
 7
 Ajanta Mendis, once considered a mystery spinner, is the career of Sri Lanka's Ajanta Mendis on the verge of becoming a mystery

 8
 said ajamalpakistan ke of spinner said ajmal par sandigdh ection ke kaaran isisi ne gendbaaji karne par bain laga diya tha
 After this decision, Ajmal also tried to improve his action, but he could not succeed fully in it
 pisibi ne bhi unhen team main jagah nahin di
 In important tournaments like World Cup, Pakistan will surely miss the lack of a deadly spinner like Ajmal
 9
 Alastair Cookingland and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) not only removed Alastair Cook from the captaincy but also denied him a place in the World Cup squad, given his team's poor performance in the recent ODI series
 vanade main cook kaa ballebaaji form bhi kuch khaas nahin rahaa he
 Whether domestic pitches or foreigners, Cook was seen battling in every situation
 10
 Umar Gulpakistan's most experienced fast bowler Umar Gul is yet to recover from a knee injury and due to this, his name was not considered for the World Cup team

 input- IANS On the anniversary of Babri demolition, Union Minister Uma Bharti appealed to Congress President Rahul Gandhi to build Ram temple
 unhone kaha ki maine ayodhya nirmaan andolan main bhagidaari kii he or 6 disambar 1992 ko main ayodhya main maujuud thi
 After describing myself as a devotee of Shiva devotees, Brahmins and Kaul Dattatreya gotras, i expect Rahul Gandhi to take initiative and come forward for the construction of the temple
 ajtak se khaas baatcheet main uma bharti ne kaha ki rahul gandhi ko pradhanmantri se adhyadesh laane kii maang kerani chahie
 He is a devotee of Shiva
 raamji kaa mandir banane se shivaji prasann ho jaaenge
 He said that till now the Congress has been stuck in the Ram temple
 ab congress hi isaki baat karegi to iskaa samaadhaan ho jayega
 Congress may riot: Union Minister Uma Bharti apprehends that the Congress is in full readiness to stage a riot, as they have a history of rioting
 congress ne 1947 main dharm ke naam par vibhaajan karavaaya, phir sikhon ko lekar dange karwaae or ab bhi mandir ko lekar bhi danga karwaane kii puri sajeesh rach rahi he
 Mamta, Akhilesh, Rahul come together and they say that Ram temple will not be made from movement but act, ordinance or harmony
 ham log taiyaar hai
 As everyone gathered to build the temple of Somnath
 isi tarah ayodhya main bhavy ram mandir nirmaan ke liye mamata banerjee, akhilesh yadav, rahul gandhi sabhi ko ek hona hoga
 Uma Bharti made it clear that the BJP never considered the Ram temple to be a vote issue
 unka kahana he ki ram par hamaara koi patent nahin he, ram sabake hai
 Ram temple can be easily constructed
 koi musalmaan bhi iskaa virodh nahin karegaa
 Solution of Ram temple is easy said that former Prime Minister Atalji had said that if there was a majority, he would have built a Ram temple too, but then there was no majority
 aaj modiji kii sarkaar ke paas bahumat he
 The solution to the Ram temple is very simple, the other party can talk to the person who has the land, by bringing an ordinance and also by law

 Many Congress leaders have been involved in damage control
 is sab ke bich villen ban rahaa he yojana ayog
 Central leader Kapil Sibal has pointed fingers at the Planning Commission
 sibbal ne kolkata main garibi rekha kii paribhaasha ko galat bataaya ou kaha ki 5 hajaar rupee main paanch logon kaa parivaar guzaara nahin kar saktaa
 Sibal was unhappy to be told that the income of Rs
 5000 per month was below the poverty line and the Planning Commission's process was revealed to be flawed
 vahiin, shanivaar ko congress mahasachiv digvijay singh ne ek twit kiya or yojana ayog ko khalanaayak bataane kii koshish kii
 Digvijay Singh wrote that he has not yet understood the way the Planning Commission works
 yojana ayog sabko ek hi taraazoo main taulne kii koshish karata he jo ki kabhi sahi nahin ho saktaa
 On the other hand, NCP has also questioned the definition of poverty line
 ensipi ne kaha he is par gahan chintan kii jarurat he
 Significantly, last week, the Planning Commission released its new data on poverty
 ayog ke mutabik, desh kii aabaadi main garibon kaa anupaat 2011-12 main ghatakar 21
 9 percent which came to 37 in 2004-05
 2 pratishat par tha

 shaharon main rashtriya garibi kii rekha kaa paimaana 1,000 rupee prati vyakti prati maah kaa upbhog he
 This means that 33 per day on goods and services in cities
 33 rupee se adhik kharch karne vaala or gramin ilaakon main 27
 a person spending 20 rupees is not poor
 isse pehle ayog ne kaha tha ki shahari ilaakon main pratidin 32 rupee se adhik kharch karne vaala vyakti garib nahin he
 a lot of controversy was generated by his calculation
 yojana ayog ne jo garibi kaa aankada diya he, vah usee gananaa ke tareeke par aadhaarit he
 It says that the number of poor in the country has decreased in the last seven years
 ayog ne kaha ki paanch vyaktiyon ke parivaar main khapat kharch ke hisaab se akhil bhartiya garibi kii rekha gramin ilaakon ke liye 4,080 rupee masik or shaharon main 5,000 rupee masik hogi
 However, the poverty line will vary from state to state

 a 7-year-old girl died of dengue despite being treated for 15 days in a large and private hospital like Fortis
 aspataal ne bacchee ke ilaaj ke badale main mata-pita ko 18 lakh kaa bill thama diya
 On an average, the expenditure of more than 1 lakh rupees per day
 ab sawaal yah he ki dengue ke ilaaj main agar is nijee aspataal ne itnaa bada bill banaaya he to kisi duusari or badi beemaari main bill kya hoga
 The Punjab and Haryana High Court is also surprised at this
 court ne is maamle kaa swat: hi sangyaan lete hue hai court ke varisht vakil anupam gupta ko court mitra vakil niyukt kiya he
 During the hearing of the Fortis case on Thursday, Anupam Gupta told the court that the hospital management paid a 15-page bill to his family after dengue treatment of the 7-year-old patient, according to which 2700 gloves and 660 syringes were used during the 15 days

 Anupam Gupta urged the court that a prompt notice should be issued to the hospital administration on this matter, as the matter is very serious
 udhar, ilaaj ke dauraan 2700 gloves or 660 syringe ke istemaal par hairaani jataate hue hoicourt kii divijan bench ne kaha ki jab aspataal dengue ke ilaaj ke liye itnaa paisa maang rahe hai to phir duusari bimariyon se grasit marijon kaa kya hoga

 *** The new year is a year for political parties to exercise their strength
 is saal ko siyaasi dangal kaa semifinal bhi kaha ja saktaa he
 After Gujarat and Himachal, political parties are gearing up for the election of 8 states this year
 lekin, nayaa saal bhoomikaayen badalane kaa saal bhi he
 Not only the Congress, which has given a tough fight in Gujarat, the rest of the parties are holding on to soft-hindutva
 ek taraf to karnataka ke mukhyamantri siddharamaiyya hi hai, jinhone jansabha main kaha ki ve hindu hai
 He cited Ram's association in his name and said that only BJP people are not Hindus
 ab karnataka main march main hi vidhansabha ke chunaav hone hai
 About 85 percent of the population in the state are Hindu voters
 inamen se 20 fisadi log lingayat hai, jo bhagwaan shiv ke upaask hai
 On the other hand, the worship of Rahul Gandhi's twenty two temples in Gujarat had been in the news
 iskaa arth yah he ki congress apni hindutv virdohi chhavi ko todane kii jugat main lagi he
 Remember, when BJP workers made a wind all over the country against cow slaughter, some of the Youth Congress workers in Kerala had openly made and ate the meat of the calf
 congress ke liye yah nuksaandeh tha kyonki secular se secular hindu bhi khule taur par bif ko lekar kuch aisa kehane se bachataa he
 It is another matter that the BJP has a different kind of tug-of-war in its ruled states
 asal main, ab sabhi partiyon kii najar hindu votaron par he
 In Gujarat, the BJP managed to save the government and credibility due to Modi's charisma
 lekin maananaa hoga ki congress ne soft hindutv apanaakar kadi takkar di
 Now taking this formula forward, the Congress is going to distribute the puja kit to 148 Ram temples in Gujarat
 koi bhi dal, yahaan tak ki khud ko kaaphi secular dikhaane or jataane vaali trinmul congress bhi is aarope se baahar nikalnaa chaahati he
 Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee is facing allegations of standing in favor of Muslims in communal disputes over the last few months in West Bengal
 durga puja or muharram ke bich visarjan ko lekar vivaad main aarope laga ki vah muslim tushtikaran main juty hai
 Now that Mukul Roy has left the party and joined the BJP, Mamta remembers her own vote bank
 aise main unhone pehle to gaay paalane waalon ko gaay dene kii yojana shuru kii or ab unke kareeb maane jane vaale anubrat mandal ne veerbhum jile main brahman sammelan main aath hajaar brahramanon kii gita banti
 There were different gifts as well
 mamata bhi isse pehle khud ko hindu bataa hi chuki hai
 Actually, there is no rocket science to know the reason behind this exercise
 bhaajapa ne mukul roy ke party main aane ke baad se abhi se 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav kii taiyaari shuru kar di he
 The BJP held a minority conference in Kolkata
 is sammelan main acchhee khaasi bheed juty thi
 This BJP was the second minority conference in the last three months
 iskaa matlab he ki ek taraf kathith secular partiyaan hindu votaron ko apane paksh main karne ke liye baichaiyn hai to duusari taraf bhaajapa in votaron ko apana maanakar chal rahi he or vah 2019 main apni majbootee rajasthan, gujarat, madhya pradesh ke alaava pashchim bengal jaise ilaake main bhi dikhaanaa chaah rahi he
 After all, BJP has not won more than 2 Lok Sabha seats till date in West Bengal
 bengal main vam morcha behad kamjor sthiti main he or agar mamata banerjee kii tiemasi kamjor padati he us satta-virdohi rujhaan ko jhapatane ke liye bhaajapa khud ko duusare vikalp ke taur par taiyaar karnaa chaahati he
 Mission 148 on the back of the flax board in the social media room in the West Bengal BJP office is the target set for the assembly
 jo abhi to shaayad dur kii kaudi lage, lekin siyasat main kuch bhi achambha nahin hota
 After all, the BJP in West Bengal in the 2011 assembly elections only 4
 5 fisadi vot mili the
 But with two seats in the Lok Sabha, this vote share had risen to 16 per cent
 2016 ke vidhansabha main, phir pichley vidhansabha kii tulana main vot share badha tha, lekin loksabhaa se thodaa kam tha
 This increase in data and the sluggishness of the Left parties is encouraging the BJP to siege with the agile
 bengal main bhaajapa ke paas le-dekar dhai chehre the
 Roopa Ganguly, Dilip Ghosh and Rahul Sinha
 babul supriyo jarur asanasol se chunaav jite hai lekin unka janaadhar apane loksabhaa kshetra main bhi kuch khaas nahin he
 Now bringing the old leader like Mukul Roy to the BJP may not have made the path easier, but now he has a face to fight
 ab, bengal hi kyon, desh bhar main teen talaak jaise muddon par udaaravaadi muslimon kaa samarthan paakar bhaajapa utsahit he
 But in the wake of the Lok Sabha elections, the game of changing images has started in the eastern, western and southern regions of the country
 iske saath hi shuruyaat ho chuki he dhruvikaran kii bhi
 If you want it, then you can say to change roles, but more than that, it is just a breach in the other's comfort zone
 yah sameekaran agar das fisadi bhi kargar hote hai to 2019 se pehle, isi saal ke chaar bade rajyon or chaar chote suubon ke chunavi dangal ke daanv bade ho jaaenge
