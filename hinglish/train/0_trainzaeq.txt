 input language paanch rajyon main haal hi main sampann hue vidhansabha chunaavon main mili haar se bhartiya janata party (bijepi) or sarkaar main badlaav kii himaayat shuru ho gai he
 One of the founding members of the party, and former Union Minister Sanghpriya Gautam, has called for a change in government and organization for the return of BJP to power at the Center in 2019
 unhone yogi adityanath ko hataakar rajnath singh ko uttar pradesh kaa mukhyamantri, shivaraj singh chouhan ko party kaa rashtriya adhyaksh or nitin gadakari ko up-pradhanmantri banane kaa suzav diya he
 Earlier, Nitin Gadkari has said that the leadership should take responsibility for the defeat in five states
 sanghapriy gautam ne ravivaar ko kaha ki party ko bachaane ke liye sarkaar or sanghathan main badlaav jaruri he
 Because only after the change, there will be enthusiasm and confidence in the disappointed party workers
 unhone kaha ki aisa na hone par narendra modi kaa phir se pradhanmantri bananaa aasaan nahin hoga
 Gautam, one of the party's most powerful leaders and the Dalit face of the party, was listed as the reason for the defeat
 "the BJP came to power with the promise of bringing back black money, ending inflation, eliminating corruption
" ye teenon vaade puure nahin hue
 On the contrary, there were allegations of PNB scam and Rafael
 haal hi main uttar pradesh ke swasthya mantri ne khud kaha tha ki sabase zyada bhrashtachar unke vibhaag main he
 According to Gautam, on December 13, he wrote an open letter to the party, only after which Nitin Gadkari spoke of a change in the organization, blaming the party general for the electoral defeat
 gautam ne kaha, modi mantra or amit shah kaa chakravyuuh haal main paanch rajyon ke chunaav main nishprabhavi ho gaya or haar kii jimmedaari pradhanmantri or bijepi adhyaksh ko khud leni chahie
 According to the news agency language, he suggested a change in the government and organization, saying, he is in favor of replacing Yogi Adityanath, making Rajnath Singh the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, Shivraj Singh Chauhan as bjp's National President and Nitin Gadkari as Deputy Prime Minister
 ye kadam pade bijepi par barigautam ne party or sarkaar kaa graph girane kii vajah bataate hue kaha, samvidhan ko badalane kii baat karnaa, samvidhan se chhedchhad karnaa, yojana ayog ko niti ayog main badalanaa, supreme court, arabiai, sibiai aadi sanvaidhanik sanghathanon main dakhsandaji, aarthik kshetra main liye nirnyon ne pratikul asar daalaa
 It was a prudent decision to form a government with manipulative politics in Manipur and Goa, imposition of President's rule in Uttarakhand, one day government in Karnataka
 janata kaa vishwaas tutagautam ke mutabik, 13 disambar ke patr main unhone likhaa ki berogari, kisaanon kaa karj maaf nahin karnaa, ganna mulya kaa bhugtan nahin karnaa, kisaanon ko laagat mulya anusaar upaj ke daam nahin dilaanaa aadi kaa nakaaratmak asar padaa
 Barring issues like corruption, inflation, black money, religion, temple-mosques, naming of cities, mob violence in the name of gokshi
 desh main alag-alag samoohon kii aarakshan kii maang or dalit andolan hue
 Martyrdom of soldiers continues on the border
 ye aise mudde hai jinaki vajah se janata kaa vishwaas tutaa
 Become Deputy Prime Minister Gadkari, he said that Lok Sabha elections are to be held, but from the circumstances it seems that now the Modi mantra will not work
 gautam ne kaha, bijepi kaa satta main aana or modi kaa piem bananaa to jaruri he, lekin saath hi sarkaar or sanghathan main badlaav bhi jaruri he
 For this, Nitin Gadkari should be made Deputy Prime Minister
 badlaav se kaaryakartaaon main vishwaas paidaa hoga
 Advani will definitely tell his pain, Gautam, 'four people have been involved in forming the party
 isamen atal bihari vaajapeyi, pramod mahajan, kalyaan singh or vah swayan shaamil the
 He said that Lal Krishna Advani's role was instrumental in strengthening the organization

 'need to work together' on the question of fogging with Delhi government minister Kapil Mishrake in his area, Tiwari said that in this time of trouble, everyone will have to work together as it is not the work of one, everyone Have their own responsibility

 kohli ne kaha ki wo or team aamir ke alaava duusare khilaadiyon par bhi dhyaan denge
 At the same time, he said on the ongoing war like atmosphere on social media that supporters should enjoy the atmosphere
 kohli ne match se pehle kaha, 'main tiarapy ke liye kuch nahin kahuunga
 'kohli said,' You should appreciate the ability of every bowler
 aapako kisi bhi gendbaaj ke khilaaf ran banane kii apni kshamta par bharosa hona chahie
 i just focus my attention on red ball or white ball cricket
 anya 10 khilaadi bhi hai jo match par apana prabhaav daal sakate hai
 'kohli said,' It is not that i will score and they will take wickets only then the matches will be lost and won
 achche parinaam ke liye donon tiimon ke baaki ke 10 khilaadiyon ko bhi behatar khelnaa hoga
 In my mind there is no competition for any one player and i do not think i need to prove anything to anyone
 mere liye yah kaaphi simpal he, agar aap acha nahin khelenge to aapako part time gendbaaj bhi out kar degaa
 'india had won the Champions Trophy between the two teams earlier in the final of the ICC Champions Trophy
 final main aamir ne bharat ke sheersh kram ko pavilion kii raah dikhaai thi

 Kohli also did not say whether he would make any change in the bowling order in the next match
 unhone kaha, 'ham paristhitiyon ke hisaab se vibhinn gendbaaji sangyojan ke bare main sochenge
 If there is an extra fast bowler option then we will consider that as well
 agar match chota hoga to usapar bhi vichaar kiya jayega
 'you have to play according to your strength - Kohli Kohli said that the mental state of all the players in the dressing room is the same as it is before any other ODI and not the atmosphere outside the ground
 unhone kaha, 'jab se ham england main aae hai tab se hamane kuch alag baat nahin kii he
 The atmosphere of the dressing room has not changed
 dressing room kaa maahaul pichley muqablon ke jaisaa hi he
 We understand that any match we play for the country, emotions are attached to it
 'kohli ne kaha, 'ek cricket khilaadi ke taur par hamen desh ke liye khilne ke liye chunaa gaya he, hamaari jimmedaari har match ko ek jaisaa lene kii he, chaahe vipakshi koi bhi ho
 Nothing has changed for us

 'aid war par kohli kaa jawabais match ko lekar aisa maahaul bana he jaise yuddh hone vaala ho, khaskar soshal media par jahaan donon deshon kii taraf se alag-alag vigyaapan chalaae ja rahe hai
 When Kohli was asked what message he would like to give to the supporters, the captain said that he should enjoy the atmosphere
 kohli ne kaha, 'hamen ummid he ki stadium puraa bharaa hoga or prashansak match kaa lutf uthaaenge
 Stadiums are filled in every match in the World Cup
 isliye khilaadi ke taur par hamaare liye yah bilkul bhi alag nahin he
 "this right-handed batsman said," i cannot ask supporters to think in this certain direction
 ek khilaadi kaa dimag samarthak se alag hota he
 You cannot mix these two
 aap prashansakon se ummid nahin kar sakate ki vah peshewar tareeke se is bare main sochenge
 Fans should enjoy the match the way he has been picking up from earlier days, but as a player we should remain professional

 is kaaran nirbhik or nishpaksh reporting kaa maahaul nahin he
 The petition was filed on 10 August
 hairaani kii baat thi ki unki yachika ke baad press council of india supreme court main hastkshep karata he or kahata he ki vah is yachika par adaalat kii madad karnaa chahta he
 The Press Council, citing 23 of its code of conduct, said that journalists and newspapers should curb themselves on sensitive national issues so that the national interest is not threatened
 patrakaron ke kai sanghathan ne press council of india ke is faisle kii aalochana kii
 The editorial in The Indian Express and The Hindu surprised and criticized the move
 editors gild of india ne bayaan jari kar kaha ki media kii swatantraaa kii hifaazat karne vaali sanstha ko press kii swatantraaa ke liye baat kerani chahie lekin ulta vah media par ankush lagane kaa samarthan kar rahaa he
 Strange that he favors keeping readers in the dark in the name of a particular situation
 gild ne press council of india ke chairman justise sike prasad se ummid jataai he ki vah apana faisalaa waapas len
 He should use the moral force of his organization to help remove the curbs on the media
 shabdash anuwaad nahin he
 Now the news is that the Press Council of India has decided to change its stand
 ab council kaa kahana he ki vah press kii swatantraaa ke saath he
 Has no right with the media
 udhar, aaj supreme court main kaaphi kuch hua
 While hearing the petition of Manohar Lal Sharma, the petition for removal of Article 370 has been submitted to the Constitution Bench, which will be heard from the first week of October
 atarni general ne court se kaha ki is maamle main notice jari na karen, ati samvedansheel maamla he
 Other countries can take advantage of this
 to supreme court ne kaha ki notice jari ho chukaa he
 We will not change the order
 ham jaanate hai lekin ham kya karen
 It is also true that tomorrow, Pakistan will stop printing newspaper due to the fear of using newspaper cuttings
 supreme court main aaj ek or yachika par sunwaayee hui, lekin raajnneeti par is dar kaa asar dikh gaya
 Pakistan gave example of Rahul Gandhi's statement in UN petition Rahul Gandhi tweeted in the morning that i disagree with the government on many issues
 lekin, main ye bilkul saafe kar dena chahta hum ki kashmir bharat kaa andruni maamla he or isamen pakistan yaa kisi duusare desh ke dakhal kii gunjaaish nahin he
 Violence is taking place in Jammu and Kashmir, but this violence is because it is being instigated and supported by Pakistan, the main supporter of terrorism around the world
 rajyapal malik ne kaha ki ye safai tabhi dete jab loksabhaa main congress ke netaa ne sanyukt raashtra kii baat kii thi
 Then why not clean it is par congress kii press conferes ke tevar kuch alag kah rahe the
 It seemed that the Congress was trying to get out of some guilt and was loudly repeating Pakistan's role behind terrorism
 vahaan se vah baluchistan tak pahunch gai
 But from the BJP, Information Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javadekar press conference and said that Rahul asked
 congress kii taraf se randeep surajevaala ne press conference kii or kaha ki prakaash jaavdekar maafee maange
 Both did not apologize until the latest news was received
 is tark se to na akhbaar chapana chahie na tivi chalanaa chahie, kyonki pakistan istemaal kar legaa
 India is a democratic country
 yahaan supreme court ne media par ankush ke sawaal par sarkaar ko notice diya he
 The court was also told not to issue a notice, anyone could use it
 to kya is vajah se supreme court sanvaidhanik kaary na kare ki pakistan istemaal kar legaa
 Now let's talk to Kann Gopinathan, who resigned from the Indian Administrative Service
 kannan ne is baat ko lekar istipha de diya ki kashmir ke logon ko pratikriya zaahir karne kaa adhikaar nahin mil rahaa he
 Just as the government has the right to take steps, in the same way people should have the right to react
 unhen is sawaal par desh kii chuppi ne baichaiyn kar diya or istipha de diya

 Abu Bakr al-baghdadi, the world's most feared terrorist, is alive again after a five-year-long death
 zindaa ho gaya he, ye bataane ke liye ki srilanka main easter ke maukey par jo serial dhamaake hue the wo usee ne karwaae the
 The blast was a revenge for his defeat in Syria
 29 april ko iesas kii media wing ne 18 minute kaa ek video jari kar daawa kiya he ki bagdadi mara nahin he, balki zindaa he
 4 July 2014 Iraq's Al Noori Mosque
 aakhri baar jahaan dikhaai diya tha bagdadi
 Then his terrorists caused havoc
 aatankiyon or sena kaa muqabla hua
 Rivers of blood started flowing
 aatank kaa saaya iraq or syria par puri tarah chaa gaya
 During this time, there were reports of his death several times
 phir wo achaanak wo gum ho gaya
 29 April 2019 is released after 4 years, 10 months and 5 days, the latest video of the biggest boss of terror in the world
 puure 1771 din baad iesas ke sargana abu bakar al bagdadi ko duniya dobaaraa dekh rahi he
 This is only the second time Baghdadi has come before the world
 wo bhi tab jab duniya ye maan chuki thi ki bagdadi mar chukaa he
 But is it really Baghdadi? Is this video correct? Where was this video recorded? When was it done? So right now the agencies all over the world including America are investigating the reality of this latest video of Baghdadi
 pataa lagane kii koshish kar rahi hai ki kya vaaki ye bagdadi jinda he? haalanki iesas kii media wing kaa daawa he ki bagdadi jinda he or vide main maujuud shaks bagdadi hi he
 The video wing of ISIS, al-furqan, released this video on 29 April 2019
 to kya iraq se lekar syria tak main jo tanon bam barasaaye gaye or hajaaron karod dollar khapa dene ke baad bhi bagdadi jinda he? kya is video ko bagdadi ke zindaa hone kaa saboot maan liya jaae? kyonki jaankaar maan rahe hai ki video main dikh rahaa shaks hoobahoo bagdadi jaisaa hi he
 Three photos have surfaced
 teenon tasviren abu bakar al bagdadi kii he
 The first picture is before the formation of ISIS
 jab 2010 main wo iraq main alqaida kaa netaa bana tha
 The second picture is from the year 2014, when after ISIS came into existence, it sent a message to the world from Mosul's al-nuri Mosque
 or khud ko khalipha ghoshit kiya tha
 And the third and most recent picture is from 29 April 2019
 teenon tasviren alag-alag vakt or halaat kii hai
 But after looking closely, it is clear that they belong to the same person
 or wo he bagdadi kii
 The eyes and the eyes of the three faces are the same
 naak ek jaisi
 The lips and the top part of it are the same
 haalanki teenon tasveeron main umr kaa fark saaf nazar aa rahaa he
 Now its beard is cooked
 chehre kii chamak gaayab he
 The marks of wrinkles are clearly visible
 chehre ke baad ab bagdadi kii awaz par gaur kiijie
 The first video (4 July 2014) contained his speech in Mosul and the second video is from 29 April 2019
 iske alaava pichley 5 saalon main kai baar bagdadi kaa audio bhi jari karne kaa daawa kiya gaya he
 In this new video, IS kingpin Baghdadi is sitting on a cushion on the ground
 gahare rang ke kapade or safed rang kii jacket main bagdadi ne sir par kaala kapadaa odh rakhaa he
 There is a cushion for putting it next to it and an automatic rifle is seen behind
 jis kamare main bagdadi baitha he uski pahchaan chupaane ke liye deevaaron par safed rang kaa kapadaa tanga he
 Apart from Baghdadi, three more people are also sitting in this room
 magar video main kisi kaa bhi cheharaa nahin dikhaaya gaya he
 Two of these three have their face covered while the third has their face blurred
 18 minute ke is video main bagdadi apane in teenon gurgon ko nirdesh de rahaa he
 Also, these terrorists are showing different reports to their boss
 jinhen wo check kar rahaa he
 At the end of the video, pictures of the Sri Lankan blast on Easter Sunday are shown
 isamen un aath aatankiyon kaa video bhi he
 Which was released on social media after the serial blast in Sri Lanka
 ab sawaal ye he ki paanch saal kii khamoshi ke baad bagdadi ne achaanak ye video kyon jari kiy he? is video ke jariye wo duniya ko kya bataanaa chahta he? to in sawaalon ke jawaab 18 minute ke isi video main hai
 The video mentions Baghdadi's defeat of the Syrian city of Baguj
 baguj aies ke kabje vaala syria kaa aakhri ilaaka tha
 In March this year, militants from Baghdadi had fled from Baguj
 iske alaava isi videon main bagdadi 3 april, 9 april, 11 april or 21 april kii chaar ghatnaon kaa zikr karata he
 By referring to these events, Baghdadi wants to assure that the video is not old but new and it is not dead but alive
 srilanka main easter sande par hue in aatanki hamalon kaa conection 5000 kimi dur syrian shahar baaguz se judaa he
 From 9 February to 23 March this year, along with the forces of American and allied forces, Iraqi and Syrian forces bombed this stronghold of ISIS, the largest and oldest stronghold of ISIS in Iraq and Syria that the roots of terror were eroded from this area
 or tab se iesas is hamale kaa badla lene ke liye chatapata rahaa tha
 The video said "the blast in Sri Lanka is a revenge for this
" hamen khushi he ki srilanka main hamaare bhaiyon ne easter ke maukey par unke gharon main ghuskar unhen maaraa or baguz main maare gaye apane bhaiyon kii shahadat kaa badla liya
 More than a thousand people have come in the attack
 jinamein america or europi log shaamil he
 i praise my brothers for attacking Sri Lanka
 "mumkin he ki bagdadi kaa ye video purana ho
 But in it, trying to tell him a new video by referring to the blast in Sri Lanka
 kyonki video main jis vakt srilanka main hue hamale kii baat kii ja rahi thi
 At that time, the video shows pictures of the attack in Sri Lanka in place of Baghdadi's face
 haalanki is video ko nayaa bataane or bagdadi ko zindaa sabit karne ke liye video main bagdadi ke zarie israeli pradhanmantri banzmin netanyahoo ke dobaaraa pradhanmantri chune jane
 The resignation of Algerian President Abdul Aziz and the coup of Sudan's President omar-al-bashir are also mentioned
 ye teenon ghatnaayen isi saal april ke maheene kii hai
 The result of the election held in Israel on 9 April
 3 april ko algerian raashtrapati abdul azeez ne apane pad se istipha diya
 On 11 April, Sudan's President Omar al-bashir was overthrown
 or 21 april ko srilanka main serial blast hua
 From this perspective, it appears that the video released by ISIS media wing al-furqan has already been recorded a week ago
 "mujhe lagata he ki tum kabhi ye nahin bhuuloge ki netanyahoo phir ek baar israel kii satta par kaabiz ho chukaa he
 And more than that, the presidents of Algeria and Sudan have been overthrown
 haalanki badakismati ye he ki ham isse sabak nahin le rahe hai
 i do not understand why people had raised their voice and what they really wanted
 jabaki unhone ek taanashaah ko hataakar duusare taanashaah ko apane sir par bitha liya he
 Which are proving to be more brutal and deadly towards Muslims than before
 main unhen yaad dilaanaa chahta hum ki aise logon se nipatane ke liye jihad zaruri he
 Atrocities can be eliminated only through jihad
 or jihad ke zarie hamen sammaan milegaa
 "if the expert is to be believed, through this 18-minute video, Baghdadi is trying to revive the IS entrants too
 khabaron ke mutabik syria or iraq main iesas ke khatme ke baavjood 20 se 25 hazaar aatanki ab bhi chupe hue hai

 ab har smarak ke 300 meter ke daayre main polithin ke istemaal par roak lag jaaegi
 Announcing this decision, Culture Minister Mahesh Sharma said that in the first phase, the government wants to send this message to the common people through public awareness
 aage chalakar kanoon ke zariye penalty bhi lagane kaa faisla liya ja saktaa he
 The ASI is responsible for 100 meters adjacent to the historical monuments and then the state governments

 Tourists said that the condition inside the memorial is more or less similar
 zaahir he
 
 
 Through this decision, the government wants to spread the message of cleanliness to the millions of common people who visit these historical monuments every year

 Of course

 italy ke pradhanmantri mario monti ne kaha he ki unke desh ko aarthik rin sankat se baahar nikalne ke liye belout (aarthik raahat package) kii jarurat nahin padegi

 italy ke media kii khabaron ke mutabik, monti ne germany ke sarkari radio eardy se kaha, ‘bhavishya main bhi italy ko europea vittiya sthirataa kosh se sahaayta kii jarurat nahin padegi
 'former EU commissioner Monty appealed to market and financial observers' not to approach it with an old view or bias

 Something similar happened with Union Minister Giriraj Singh on Tuesday, what Giriraj gave to the newspapers and social media by looking at the photos of Iftar organized by the leaders of various parties in Patna, the opposition was left behind by the leaders and allies of his own party
 The leaders of Dal United left no stone unturned in their criticism
 ab to giriraaj ke samarthak bhi maanate hai ki unke raajnneetik jivan main chand ghanton main unhen kabhi itani raajnneetik fajihat nahin jhelni padi
 Giriraj Singh had a tweet which was disputed
 kitni khubasurat tasviir hoti jab itani hi chahat se navaratri pe falahar kaa aayojan karte or sundar sudanr photo aate??
 
 
 Why do we go backward in our karma dharma and keep ahead in pretense ??? pic
 twitter
 com / dy7s1ugbgy The tidiest slap for Giriraj on this tweet must have been the news that started appearing on all the channels that BJP National President and Union Home Minister Amit Shah has spoken to him on the issue of this tweet and put his class
 bhavishya main aise twit na karne kii naseehat bhi di he
 Before this news came, Deputy Chief Minister and senior BJP leader Sushil Modi condemned Giriraj's statement
 modi ne giriraaj ko aade haathon lete hue mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ke samarthan main kaha ki chaahe ram navami kii puja ho yaa navaratri, holi milan ho yaa iftaar, nitish kumaar na keval sab main bhaag lete hai balki agar baat aayojan karne kii ho to bhi peeche nahin hatate
 Some Bihar BJP leaders say that even when Nitish Kumar and BJP were opposed to each other, Nitish never shies away from welcoming the Durga Puja celebrations of Nitin, Naveen, Sanjeev Chaurasia and Sanjay Mayukh or the Ram Navami procession
 Were
 bihar main nitish mantrimandal main kuch mantriyon kaa to yah bhi karnaa he ki jab nitish mantrimandal main giriraaj singh mantri hote the tab mukhyamantri awaas main yojit hone vaali iftaar main unki maujuudagi bhi hoti thi
 When Janata Dal United spokesperson Sanjay Singh advised Giriraj Singh to get mental treatment, he might have felt that he got himself upset with one of his tweets without talking
 haalanki nitish kumaar ne ek vaakya main puure ghatnakram ko kaarij kar diya ki yah sab kuch media main surkhiyon main bane rahane ke liye giriraaj singh karte hai
 However, Giriraj supporters believe that he is getting more retweets and likes on this tweet on social media
 lekin ve yah bhi maanate hai ki anayas yah twit kar giriraaj singh ne bihar kii raajnneeti main apni gambhirtha khud kam kii he
 In Rajasthan, which is on the threshold of assembly elections, Congress has got the hope of standing on its feet
 loksabhaa kii do seat or vidhansabha kii ek seat par congress ko jeet kaa anand mila he
 Hence, there is an atmosphere of celebration in Jaipur
 shaayad lambey samay baad congress ko is tarah kaa jashn manaane kaa mauka mila he
 Congress won the Mandalgarh Assembly seat by 12 thousand 976 votes, Ajmer and Alwar Lok Sabha seats have also defeated the BJP by a big margin and it is time for the bjp's Vasundhara Raje government to step into the grip, as the next Imtehan Maharani Belongs to bijepi ke liye rajasthan kii haar isliye bhi khatre kii ghanti he kyonki congress loksabhaa siton par apana khaataa kholane main kaamyaab rahi he
 Rajasthan had given 100 per cent mandate to BJP by handing over all 25 seats, but now it has become a hole
 pehle gujarat or ab rajasthan, bijepi ke liye chintaa kii baat he hi
 It is also a matter of restlessness that the Karni Sena, whose Vasundhara government went to the Supreme Court to win the heart, has given a reply to the BJP
 karani sena bijepi kii haar par jashn manaa rahi he, yani ki rajputon ke vot bijepi se khiskate dikh rahe hai
 By winning one Lok Sabha and one assembly seat in West Bengal, TMC has shown that BJP may come in second but will win the match

 kya aap phek news se saavdhaan hai? duniyabar main phek news loktantr kaa galaa ghontne or taanaashaahon kii mouj kaa zariyaa ban gaya he
 An entire system has been developed for creating and spreading fake news from the capital to the district level
 yahi nahin sanvaidhanik padon par baithe log bhi phek news de rahe hai
 The weakened media is unable to muster the courage to put the right facts before them
 pehle panne par raashtra pramukh kaa bayaan chhapata he jisamen phek jaankaree hoti or jab galati pakadi jaati he to phir vahi akhbaar agle din usee spes main chhapane kii himmat nahin juta paata he ki raashtrapati yaa pradhanmantri ne jhootha bayaan diya he
 It has become very risky for media, journalists and readers to find out whether the news is real or fake
 puri duniya main is beemaari se ladane par vichaar ho rahaa he
 How to avoid fake news
 isi march main america main vipakshi dal democrate ke saansadon ne phek news ke virodh main ek bill pesh kiya
 In which it was said that the situation has become such that now people are getting fake news from the President and his spokespersons
 trump ke shapath ke samay white house ke pravaktaa spicer ne bayaan diya tha ki isse pehle kabhi nahin hua ki kisi shapath grahan samaaroh main chalakar itane log aae or puri duniya main dekha gaya
 It does not contain facts
 trump ne kaha ki koi das, saadhe das lakh log kii bheed nazar aa rahi thi
 In India, when leaders have been calling a rally of one lakh to a million, people in America have challenged how the spokesperson and the president counted the crowd
 isliye sadan se prastaav paas karne kaa anurodh kiya gaya ki white house ke pravaktaa phek news jari na karen
 This bill has been sent to the Committee of Judicial
 ai phone or ai pad banane vaali appal company ke pramukh tim kook ne ek british akhbaar se kaha he ki phek news logon ke dimaag kii hatya kar rahaa he
 a company like him would have to develop a means to filter out fake news and not affect freedom of expression
 british akhbaar ko die intervyuu main tim kook ne sarkaron se bhi kaha ki ve phek news se ladane ke liye soochna abhiyaan chalaayen
 Fake news is being discussed in governments, organizations and universities all over the world
 bharat main angrezi ke kuch website ne phek news se ladane kaa prayaas shuru kiya he
 altnews
 in, india spend, boom, hoax slayer, hindi main media vigil
 There are very few attempts in Hindi
 philipinos main phek news bahut badi samasya ban gai he
 The president there is accused that he is encouraging fake news a lot to keep hold of power
 iske baad bhi vahaan kuch logon ne phek news se ladane kii bahes ched di he
 Philstar of 22 June 2017
 com par chhapi khabar ke anusaar philipinos ke sinetter joyal vilanueva ne ek bill pesh kiya ki nakli khabaron ke failte sansar se chintaa ho rahi he
 Fake news is being published and spread in different media
 isliye un par jurmaana hona chahie
 Senate Bill 1492, or An Act Penalizing the Malicious Distribution of False News and Other Related Violations, is the name of that bill
 is bill main phek news failaane vaale sarkari adhikariyon par bhi baari jurmaane yaa sazaa kii vakaalat kii gai
 Punishment of one to five years has also been made
 agar koi media house phek news failaata he to use bees saal kii sazaa ho
 Philippines journalists said that something must be done to stop fake news, but the provisions in the bill are against the freedom of the press
 sinetter kaa kahana he ki ham phek news ko halke main nahin le sakate hai
 It is turning people into crowds
 philipinos main hi ek saal pehle 24 november 2016 ko University of the Philippines ne phek news se ladane ke liye ek online channel TVUP hi laanch kar diya
 The executive director of the university had given a statement that through this they hope that the option of junk of news spread online will be ready
 taaki nagarikon ke paas asli lekh, asli khabar jaanane ke avasar uplabdh rahe
 What is happening in India? research ke dauraan ek or baat saamne ai On the one hand, governments are thinking of a way to fight the fake news epidemic, while governments are crushing the freedom of the press in the guise of fighting fake news
 sarkaron ke liye phek news ek tarah se donon haath main laddu he
 The media is spreading fake news
 raashtrapati pradhanmantri phek news failaa rahe hai, protsaahit kar rahe hai or ab aapane dekha sarkari tantra ke log yani afasarshahi bhi nakli khabaron kaa jaal bicha rahi he
 In March, the Reporters Without Borders (RSF) in Washington released its report on the freedom of the press in the world, in which India is very bad, it also expressed concern over the actions of governments in the name of fighting fake news
 sanstha kaa maananaa he ki phek news taanaashaahon ke liye vardaan he
 Ever since Trump called CNN fake news, many heads of state have found an excuse to rein in the media
 turki ke raashtrapati erdogan ne phek news se ladane ke naam par kai patrakaron ko jail bhej diya
 The Prime Minister of Cambodia also said that Trump is right that the media is anarchist
 cambodia main kaam kar rahe videshi media ko shanti or sthayitv ke liye khatara bataa diya
 In Russia too, preparations have been made to make laws to fight fake news
 britain kii sansad kii khel media or samskruti cameti jaanch kar rahi he ki loktantr par phek news kaa kya asar padataa he
 In this way, you see that governments are taking advantage of fake news in two ways to strangle democracy and pioneer their chair
 ek taraf sarkaar phek news failaa rahi he doosraa usase ladane ke naam par un patrakaron kaa galaa ghont de rahi he jinase maamuli chook ho jaati he
 There is a huge difference between mistake and fake news
 taanaashaahon ke liye phek news se ladanaa propeganda kaa nayaa hathiyaar he
 The assessment of any government should also be from the fact that in its era there was free media or dock media
 isi 4 march ko sanyukt raashtra sangh kii ek samiti ne bayaan jari kar kaha tha ki sanvaidhanik padon par baithe log media ko jhootha bataa rahe hai yaa phir use vipaksh qaraar de rahe hai
 Whereas the job of governments is to maintain the atmosphere of freedom of expression
 phek news ke bahaane ek nae kism kaa sensorship aa rahaa he
 Critical thinking is being suppressed
 egypt or turki main kai patrkaar maamuli chook ko phek news bataakar jail bhej die gaye
 Like fake news, fake debates are also happening in TV
 jaise aapane dekha hoga amarnath yatriyon par hue hamale ko lekar sawaal yah nahin tha ki suraksha main chook kaise ho gai, isaki jagah kai or duusare sawaal paidaa kar diye gaye
 In this way, shifting the question is the work of fake debate
 phek news aapke jaanane ke adhikaar par hamalaa he
 You spend up to five hundred thousand rupees on news every month
 isamen akhbaar channel or data pack kaa kharchaa shaamil he
 Are you paying for fake news too? phek news ne raajnneeti ko bhi jatil bana diya he
 Through powerful news, a powerful party destroys a less powerful party
 is khel main kam sansaadhan vaale dal phek news kii jaal main funs jate hai
 IT cells or supporters of big parties are busy spreading fake news
 ab ek dal duusare dal ke phek news ko pakadaney ke liye team bana rahaa he
 The election of France led to the formation of a fake news alert team by the National Front
 jaldi hi bharat ke dalon ko bhi phek news alert team kaa gathan karnaa padegaa
 Currently, not every party has the facility to create fake news
 kamazor dal maare jaayenge
 Wherever elections come, there is a lot of fake news
 pichley saal italy main janamat sangrah hua to vahaan fasebuk par jo story share hui, usamen se aadhi nakli thi
 The European Union has set up a task force to face the fake news coming from Russia, east startcom task force
 france or netherland main hue chunaav ke liye is task force ko kaaphi paisa or sansaadhan diya gaya taaki vah rus ke propeganda ko roak sake
 Russia is accused of spending a lot of money on fake news
 aapane dekha ki phek news ko lekar kootnithik yuddh bhi chhidaa hua he
 a big job of fake news is to spread hatred through fake news
 hinsa ke liye uksaana
 In July this year, the German Parliament passed a law according to which a fine of up to 50 million euros could be imposed if a social media network did not remove hateful content within 24 hours
 is kanoon ko lekar bhi chintaa he ki kahin yah abhivyakti kii azaadi kaa galaa ghontne kaa zariyaa na ban jaae
 The German Justice Minister has said that the law of the jungle is running on the Internet, this law has been brought to abolish the same
 roitre kii is khabar main ye bhi tha ki fasebuk jaise soshal media network ne is kanoon par chintaa jataate hue kaha tha ki aisi sandigdh saamagree ko hataane ke liye duniyabar main 3000 logon kii team banaaenge
 The team of 4500 people is currently reviewing the post
 aap soch sakate hai ki jab ek network ko nafrat failaane vaali saamagree pakadaney main hazaron log tainaat karne pad rahe hai to is vakt duniya main phek news kitni badi samasya hogi
 In the newsroom, the number of reporters to cover every issue is constantly decreasing
 aap jin ankaron ko dekhakar star samajhate hai darasal wo patrakarita ke sankat ke jite jaagate pratik hai
 If the ghost of fake news does not travel in the empty news room, then where will it go
 pashchim bengal main asanasol ke bijepi iti cell ke sachiv tarun sengupta ko kathith rup se phek photo post karne ke aarope main giraftaar kiya gaya he
 Tarun uploaded a fake video during Ramnavami that a Muslim police officer is killing a Hindu man
 is video ke saath aapattijanak or sampradayik tippanee kii gai thi
 They have been imposed with non-surety streams
 bijepi ke pradesh adhyaksh dilip ghosh kaa kahana he ki puraane video ko lekar giraftaar hui he
 This has been done to discredit the BJP

 But who is the head of all this? is sawaal par sab le dekar lalu or unke parivaar kaa hi raag alaapte hai
 Senior RJD leader Abdulbari Siddiqui says that the party has already authorized Lalu Prasad ji for this decision

 First contender, Rabri Devi There is a possibility that Lalu Prasad Yadav may command the party to former Chief Minister and his wife Rabri Devi
 1997 main jab isi chaara ghotaale ke chalate vah pehali baar jail ja rahe the tab unhone apni patni ko sidhe rasoi ghar se nikaal kar mukhyamantri kii kursi par baithaaya tha
 It is also believed that no one in the party will mind in his name
 udhar lalu ke chote bete tejasvi bhi party sanghathan main teji se sakriy ho rahe hai
 Another contender, Raghuvansh Prasad Singh: There is a possibility that senior MP and party's most senior leader Raghuvansh Prasad Singh could be made the executive chairman
 iske do siyaasi phaayde honge
 The first Rajput will send a good message to the voters
 doosraa lalu par jo parivaarwaad ke aarope lagate hai, vah kuch kund ho jaaenge

 lekin jameen par ve sapane hakeekat main kitne badale in sawaalon kaa jawaab bhi kaashi ke saansad or desh ke pradhanmantri narendra modi (PM Modi) ko dena hoga
 PM Modi brought schemes worth several thousand crores to Varanasi
 beete 5 saalon main 19 baar vah apane sansadeey kshetra pahunche or kai yojanaon kaa shilanyas or locarpan kiya lekin abhi tak kai kaam adhure hai
 There were also basic problems like road power, water, sewer, which have not improved in the interior of Varanasi
 shahar ke bahari hisse main ring road zarur badla jisaki vajah se single road vaale banaras ko four len vaali sadaken mil gai hai
 There are other challenges as well
 banaras main sabase adhik baniyaa 3
 25 lakh, which is considered to be the core voter of the BJP and in 2014, they participated enthusiastically but this time they are angry with demonetisation and GST
 isamen bahut bada ek tabaka he jo saamne to modi-modi karata he lekin bheetar hi bheetar wo naaraaz he
 After this, the number of Brahmins is also two and a half lakhs, who were once the original voters of the Congress, but since 1989, these voters are with the BJP
 haalanki is bich 2004 main congress ke rajesh mishra ne is vot ko apni taraf kar jeet hasil kii thi uske baad se ye lagaataar bijepi ke saath hai lekin is baar vishwanath coridor main zyaadaatar brahmanon ke hi makaan toote hai lihaaja ye tabaka behad naaraaz he
 This is the southern part of the city, which is called the backbone of the BJP
 par is baar yahi behad naaraaz he jo nuksaan pahunchaa saktaa he
 Banaras is also a city of ghats along the streets, thousands of people of Nishad fraternity live on these 84 ghats along the banks of the Ganges
 ye birdari 2014 main badi ummid ke saath piem modi se judy thi lekin beete paanch saalon main inhe behad niraashaa mili
 This fraternity believes that in these five years, she struggled to save her living bread for the most time, because the agitation on her injury to her livelihood was done by running a cruise in the Ganges, but the government did not listen to them
 inaki bhi naaraazgi bhi inako jhelni pad sakati he
 Like Nishad, the Yadav fraternity also has 1 lakh 50 thousand votes, which was voting for BJP for the last several elections, but this time it is seen standing with Akhilesh Yadav
 dalit 80 hazaar or muslim lagbhag teen lakh ke aasapaas hai
 In the 2014 elections, the SP-BSP fought separately and the Muslim had gone towards Kejriwal, due to which he got 2 lakh 9 thousand votes
 ab agar ye vot ek saath aate hai to ek aisi chunauti ban sakati he jise aap nazarandaz nahin kar sakate
 It is clear that this election is not as easy as it seems for PM Modi, and PM Modi understands this very well, that is why he has appealed to his workers to get maximum votes in the workers' conference
 loksabhaa chunaav (lok Sabha Election) ke liye bhaajapa ne zyaadaatar siton ke ummidavaaron kii list jari kar di he
 Seats continued to be divided on Tuesday, and parliamentary constituencies continued to swap
 aise main kai shaharon ke sambhavit ummidavaaron ke naam bhi kate
 In the most parliamentary constituency state of Uttar Pradesh, BJP has announced the names of 29 candidates
 kai pratyaashiyon ke shahar badale, jabaki kuch ummidavaaron kaa tikat bhi kaata
 Some of them vented their frustration in despair, while many agreed to campaign in support of the party

 Despite this, Trump did not even look away from him to join hands with Merkel

 What will happen if the draft of the New Education Policy (NEP) 2019 comes into force by 2035 according to its vision? It was made up of nine members on 31 May
 kasturirangan samiti ne kendriya maanav sansaadhan mantralay ko saunpa he
 Let us now imagine how the life of Rohan born in 2032 will progress
 jab vah teen saal kaa hoga to use 5+3+3+4 ke dhaanche ke tahat aupchaarik shiksha main daakhil kiya jayega
 For the first three years, he would get pre-school training — in at least three languages — and he would also give him trained teachers
 is dauraan vah kakehara, ank, rang or akritiyaan sikhega, paheliyaan hal karegaa or naatak, kathputli ke khel, sangeet or harakat se rubaru hoga
 There will be no textbook, all the learning will be done in sports and experimental, and in a school campus which will have clean toilets, long rooms, IT enabled gazette, plenty of play and cheerful atmosphere
 kaksha 1 se 5 main use nishchit ghanton main padhgaye or ganit seekhney kaa vakt milegaa kyonki paanchavin kaksha tak use aksharon or ankon kaa buniyadi gyaan hasil kar lenaa hoga
 If Rohan has a 'special interest' and / or 'talent' —may be in mathematics, sports, painting, or acting — the teacher will recognize and guide and encourage him to develop
 kaksha 6 se aage rohan ko paathyakram se judi or paathyakram se alahada gatividhiyon ko lekar phikr nahin kerani padegi kyonki ganit se lekar khel or sangeet or painting tak tamaam vishay paathyakram kaa hissaa honge
 He can choose the topic of his interest
 beshak, kuch saajha anivaary vishay to honge hi
 He will also be introduced to some vocational training at this level so that he can decide which vocational subject to take when he reaches class 9
 is dauraan information technology ke jariye uskaa niyamit moolyankan kiya jayega or uske seekhney ke graph ko record kiya jaataa rahegaa taaki uske liye makul yojana banaai ja sake
 At the end of classes 3, 5 and 8 will be tested so that his ability to think critically and his language and math skills can be measured
 kaksha 9 se rohan chah-chah maheene ke semester main teen vishyon kii online board pariksha degaa
 This examination will be designed in such a way that it will test his understanding of the core subjects, not his skill of memorizing or rote
 vah board kii pariksha saal main do baar yaa shaayad zyada baar bhi de saktaa he
 When Rohan completes class 12, he can go to any college or university near his home, as good higher education institutions will be opened in every district of the country
 ve teen saal ke yaa chaar saal ke niyamit course yaa vyavsaayik course kii peshkash karenge
 Alternatively, vocational training may be included in its degree course
 yah 2020 ke dashak kii tarah nahin hoga jab aapako ek dhara chunani padati he—sabhi digriyaan bahuvishayak hongi, jo use misaal ke liye itihaas ke saath bhautikashastra padhgaye kii ijaajat dengi
 If Rohan wants to join professional course, he will be able to go to any university because they will all be multidisciplinary
 to is tarah ejineering yaa medical degree kii padhai karte hue vah samaaj vigyaan kaa vishay bhi le saktaa he or yah pataa laga saktaa he ki uski degree uske sthaneey or vaishvik paryaavaran par acha asar kaise daal sakati he
 In the last year of the degree course, Rohan can opt for research or one year after completing the three-year degree course
 is tarah vah pehle master degree kii padhai kiye bagaiyr piechdi main dakhila le sakegaa, haalanki vah master degree ke baad doctoret kaa vikalp bhi chun saktaa he
 He, or his institute, will not have to worry about funding for his research as the National Research Foundation will bear the cost of the project if his project is related to local, national or global issues
 agar rohan itane lambey vakt tak academik jagat main rahanaa na chaahe, to uske paas kai vikalp honge, us chaar saal lambii udaar degree ke dauraan, jo use 21veen sadi kii gyaan arthvyavastha ke liye taiyaar karegi
 This is just an early glimpse of how NEP wants to change the country's education system by 2035
 484 pannon kaa yah dastavej vistrut yojana kaa khaakaa pesh karata he jisamen skool purv, skool or ucch shiksha ke saath-saath vyavsaayik, vayask or shikshak prashikshan or niyam-kaayade shaamil hai
 It also suggests some reforms that have created new avenues, such as strengthening early childhood education programs in schools, focusing on teacher training programs, adding vocational courses to school courses, raising funds for research in higher education
 And to restructure top regulatory bodies and create new ones for qualitative changes in higher education
 skool shiksha ke kshetra main kaary kar rahe gaiyr-munafa sanghathan central skhwaayar foundation ke sansthaapak tathaa chairman ashish dhawan kehete hai, ''eneepi main chaatr ke shaikshik parinaamon main sudhaar kii khatir focus badalane ke liye kuch saahsee or swaagatyogy siforishein kii gai hai
 But if we make sure to equip all children with the basic skills of letters and numbers - this effort alone will have a tremendous impact on the education system
 ''padhgaye or ginaney kii talimenipi 2019 kaa amulchul badlaav laane vaala suzav skool purv shiksha ko aupchaarik shiksha ke dhaanche main shaamil karnaa he
 The NEP scientist advocates pre-school education and cites neuroscience research to show that 85% of a child's brain develops before the age of 6
 yah rashtriya shiksha anusandhan or prashikshan parishad (ensiiarti) ke 1992 main 30,000 bacchon par kiye gaye adhyayan kaa bhi hawala detii he ki skool purv shiksha milane or skool na chhodie tathaa upasthiti kii daron or, sabase ahm, praathmik skool tathaa usase upar kii shiksha ke parinaamon ke bich paraspar sidhaa rishta he
 Pre-school education also affects the economic development of individuals and countries
 jeenyu main arthshaastra ke professor santosh mehrotra ek shodh kaa hawala dete hai ki bachapan main shiksha hasil karne vaale logon kii jindagi bhar kii kamai un logon se kahin zyada hoti he jo bachapan main talim se vanchit rah gaye the
 NEP estimates that the country will get a return of 10 rupees in return for an investment of 1 rupee in pre-school education
 isi ke saath anusandhan yah bhi bataate hai ki 8 saal se kam umr ke bachche pathyapustak-unmukh shiksha ke liye taiyaar nahin hote
 This means that a large part of our children are not getting the education they need
 maujuuda vakt main bachapan kii zyaadaatar shuruaati shiksha anganwadiyaan or nijee pre-skool de rahe hai
 Anganwadis being run under the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) have given good results in terms of health care for mothers and babies, but have lost focus on education
 nijee pre-skool behatar buniyadi dhaancha jarur muhaiyaa karte hai, par unke paathyakram or padhaane ke tareeke aise nahin hai jisaki bachapan kii shuruaati shiksha ke liye jarurat he
 It is not surprising that a 2017 study by Ambedkar University showed that a large number of children of Hindustan who completed pre-primary education from any government or private institution were not eligible for primary school admission
 2018 ke anual states of ajukeshan report (eyesiaar) survey ne paaya ki kaksha 5 ke 50 fisadi chaatr hi kaksha 2 kii pathyapustak pard pate the
 So, the gross enrollment ratio has come down from 95 per cent in class 1-5 to 79 per cent in class 9-10
 yahi vajah he ki eneepi kii sabase oonchi praathamikta 2025 tak praathmik skulon or usase aage kii kakshaon main saarvbhaumik buniyadi sakshartaa or ankagyan hasil karnaa he
 The draft NEP states, "if this most basic education — reading, writing and arithmetic at the basic level — is not achieved first, the rest of the policy will be largely irrelevant to such a large section of our students
 '' yah bhi pakkaa karnaa hoga ki 3 se 18 saal ke bich kii umr ke sabhi chaatro ko muft or anivaary shiksha bal adhikaar (sanshodhan) 2019 ke daayre main laayaa jaae
 NEP also recommends that the current 10 + 2 model be replaced by a 5 + 3 + 3 + 4 curriculum and a scientific framework of education that is based on the child's cognitive and social-emotional development stages
 yah sifarish karti he ki skool purv (3-6 varsh kii umr) ke teen saal ko kaksha 1 or 2 (8 saal kii umr tak) main milakar ise ek vaigyanik shiksha ikai bana diya jaae jise 'buniyadi charan' kaha jayega
 Class 3-5 (ages 8-11 years) will be called the ready phase, after which there will be secondary phase of classes 6-8 (ages 11-14 years) and finally higher of classes 9-12 (ages 14-18 years)
 There will be secondary phase
 eneepi kaa masauda kahata he ki 8 saal se kam umr ke bachche bhashaaen zyada teji se sikhte hai or bhashaa siikhnaa bachche ke sangyanatmak vikaas kaa behad ahm pahalu he, isliye vah sifarish karata he ki is avasthaa main bahut-si bhashaaen—kam se kam teen—sikhaai jaaen
 Educationists, however, do not agree with this
 bengaluru sthit da teacher foundation kii sansthaapak maaya menon kahati hai, ''yah sahi nahin he
 Children need to master their home language / mother tongue, especially in the case of linguistic skills of reading and writing, and then they may be ready for the formal study of another language
 ''1993 kii aitihaasik yashpal samiti kii report 'larning vidout bardan' (boj ke bagaiyr siikhnaa) ko aage le jate hue eneepi chaatro par vishay saamagree or pathyapustakon ke boj ko kam karne kaa jatan karti he or totartent padhai ko hatotsahit karti he
 Therefore, the emphasis in the curriculum framework will not be on learning from textbooks, but instead on hands-on learning, experience and analysis
 kala, sangeet, dastakaari, khel, yoga or saamudayik seva sahit tamaam vishay paathyakram ke hisse honge
 The course will promote knowledge on multilingualism, ancient Indian knowledge systems, scientific temperament, moral prudence, social responsibility, digital literacy and the most important issues facing local communities
 board ke imtihaan ab jindagi tay karne vaali or behad tanaav se bhari kavayad nahin honge
 Between classes 8 and 12, students will be able to take the board examinations twice a year
 baad main, jab computerikrut anukool pariksha pranali vyapak rup se maujuud hogi, tab unhen bahut-si parikshaayen dene kii ijaajat hogi, kam se kam 24 vishyon main, yaa ausatan ek semester main teen
 Only basic abilities, basic education, skills and analysis will be tested in the exam
 eneepi kahati he, 'chaatro ko koching or ratta maare bagaiyr aasaani se paas hona chahie
 'another concept, derived from the 1964 Kothari Commission report, is to build school campuses
 sarkari skulon ko nae sire se banaakar sanghathanaatmak or prashasnic ikaayiyon main badla jayega, jinhen skool parisar kaha jayega
 There will be a secondary school (up to class 9-12) and there will be many other schools around it which will train from pre-primary to class 8
 skool parisar ko apane maatahat aane vaale sabhi skulon ke academik or prashasnic maamalon ko sanbhaalane kii swaittata hogi or ve rajya main skool shiksha vyavastha ke sabase nichle paaydaan ke taur par kaam karenge
 All the schools in the campus will be able to employ the services of a common group of teachers, which will compensate for schools with low learning resources
 haalanki pratham kii siio rukmini banerjee ko lagata he ki eneepi main praathmik charan ke baad schuli shiksha ko lekar saaf-saaf dishanirdesh nahin hai
 She says, "above the primary stage, the major things have been written, but more work needs to be done to create a coherent and comprehensive framework for weaving the fabric of these things
 '' centre for policy research main senior phelo kiran bhatti ek baat or kahati hai: ''eneepi ne kai udaatt lakshya tay kiye hai magar yah skool parisar se shuru hokar theth jamini str par kshamta nirmaan ke bare main kuch nahin kahati
 Despite these structural and curriculum changes, NEP accepts that teachers will be the pivots around which this revolution of education can be carried out

 He says, "give education and teachers their right
" shikshakon par bharosa karo, unhen peshewar taur-tareekon ke saath taiyaar karo or unhen apane kaamon ko anjaam dene main sahaayta do
 This will be the first step towards the implementation of this policy
 ''eneepi ke mutabik, bhavishya main sabhi shikshak chaar saal kii anivaary udaar ekikrut bachaler degree hasil karenge or uske baad hi shikshak paatrata pariksha (tiiti) sareekhee bhartee pariksha main baith sakenge

 She says, "the redesigned teacher training policy needs to be more liberal without diluting quality, where university-based multi-disciplinary colleges of teacher training may be one way, while district education and training institutions ( What will happen to DIET? ”this policy also sets the goal of providing better working environment to teachers

 Recognition, promotion and salary increases will be given to teachers who do exceptional work; He would be mostly employed in his hometown; Support will be given in terms of working environment, resource material and training; The functioning will be evaluated periodically to maintain their accountability

 "nalanda-taxila Model" For the higher education sector, the NEP has some high-altitude targets such as increasing the gross enrollment ratio to 50 percent (existing 25 percent) by 2035, autonomy to all higher education institutions (heis) and a quality university in every district of the country
 to open
 in lakshyon ko praapt karne ke liye eneepi takshashila or nalanda ke pracheen bhartiya vishvavidhyalayon kaa udhaaharan detii he, jisamen desh-videsh ke hajaaron chaatr-chatraayen jeevant bahu-vishyak vaataavaran main adhyayan kar rahe the
 It proposes that by 2030, all heis become institutions of one of these three types - research universities, teaching universities, and colleges
 ek vishvavidhyalay kaa matlab hoga ucch-gunvattta vaale shikshan, anusandhan or sevaaon ke saath snaatak or snatakottar kaaryakramon kii peshkash karne vaale bahu-vishyak echii
 Universities will not be a subject; All universities, including professional universities, will be multi-disciplinary
 kasturirangan kaa maananaa he ki yah bahu-vishyak drushtikon bhartiya chaatro ko bhavishya ke naukari bazaaron ke liye taiyaar karegaa
 He says, "think that technological developments such as artificial intelligence (AI) can cause jobs to change or disappear
" eani dhire-dhire parishkrut domen-vishisht kaaryon ko sanbhaalane main sakasham hota ja rahaa he, isliye vyavsaayik shiksha ko ekikrut karnaa or bahu-vishyak jaankariyaan pradaan karnaa jaruri he taaki chaatro ko nai duniya main apni purna kshamtaaon kaa upyog karne ke liye taiyaar kiya ja sake
 It will also be interesting to see if the bjp-led central government will accept the proposal to implement a four-year multi-disciplinary graduate degree in liberal education, with many exit options and appropriate certification
 yah usee tarj par hoga jaisaa dilli vishvavidhyalay ke purv kulapati dinesh singh ne thode samay ke liye lagu kiya tha, lekin tatkaaleen maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantri smriti irani or vampanthi jhukaav vaale faikalti ke virodh ke kaaran vah use waapas lene par majaboor hue the
 NEP, however, also allows the continuation of a three-year traditional undergraduate degree
 eneepi is baat ko bhi samajhati he ki adhikansh vishvavidhyalayon or collejon main koi shodh nahin ho rahaa he or vibhinn vishyon main paardarshita, shodh ke liye pratispardhi samiksha ke saath funding kii kami he

 In addition to providing individual professional degrees, vocational education will be included in the regular curriculum at school, college and university level

 Rajput says, "earlier efforts to generate interest in hand skills and professional skills at secondary level did not succeed

 The present proposal makes no separation between the professional and academic streams and is a new and bold step
 ''narendra modi sarkaar kaa pehle se hi chal rahe kaushal vikaas kaaryakramon ko majbootee dene ke liye vyavsaayik shiksha kaa paathyakram, kaushal vikaas or udhyamita mantralay ke rashtriya kaushal yogyata dhaanche par jor he

 This has been a major problem with Indian schooling for decades, where governments have traditionally been regulators and administrators and their enthusiasm for innovation, quality and high standards has been lacking

 But the famous sterilization expert of Madhya Pradesh, Dr
 lalitmohan pant ke shabdon main unka yah oparation ek maa ko parivaar niyojan ke oparation ke dhai ghante ke bheetar nayaa janm dene jaisaa tha
 The senior government surgeon claims that he reversed the sterilization operation of a 24-year-old woman at a remote community health center with modest facilities within a span of just two and a half hours and returned her ability to become a mother
 dow
 Pant, sharing the rare medical experience, said that he had successfully performed Uma Chauhan (24) on February 12 during a sterilization camp at the Community Health Center in Maheshwar, about 100 km from here
 lekin iske thodi der baad unhen kaha gaya ki vah is oparation ko ulatate hue mahila kii band kii gayin dimbavahini naliyon ko khol den
 He said that this request was made to him because Uma's 21-day-old sick girl died just half an hour after the sterilization operation, so she wanted to become a mother again
 dow
 Pant said, 'I have done about three lakh sterilization operations during the last three decades
 lekin maine is oparation ko itani jaldi kabhi nahin ulataa tha
 Secondly, i did not have the necessary tools nor other facilities for this fine surgery in that community health center in remote area
 lekin maine aatma kii aawaaj par yah oparation karne kaa faisla kiya
 The senior government surgeon reported that he opened both of the woman's ovarian tubes using a common laparoscope and other minor tools two and a half hours after the sterilization operation
 phir in naliyon main dawaaon or vishesh rasayanon kaa ghol pravaahit kiya gaya, taaki inaki sujan kam ho sake or ve puraani sthiti main laut saken
 Dr
 pant kaa daawa he ki nasbandi ko ulatney ke oparation ke baad ab uma dobaaraa maa ban sakati hai

 Both have arrived here to participate in the conference on Afghanistan
 yah conference 4 or 5 oktober do dinon kii he
 It has been made clear from both sides of India and Pakistan that there is no fixed meeting schedule between the two, although when both are in a city, then the eye will be on whether both are formally correct, but whether informally But only right, we will meet each other
 ummid or bad jaati he jab donon conference ke dauraan ek haul ke bheetar maujuud honge
 This is the first time since Uri and the surgical strike when ministerial level politicians from countries will be present at a conference
 aisi ummid isliye jataai ja rahi he ki pichley 48 ghanton main donon deshon ke rashtriya surakshakaron ke bich do baar baatcheet khabar ai he
 It was also said that in this conversation both the NSA agreed to reduce the tension on the loc
 Although the news came from the Pakistani media, it was not officially confirmed by the Indian Foreign Ministry or NSA office, nor was it The news was denied
 tippaniyan There is also a fact that Akbar and Aziz are not on a clandestine visit to Brussels, but are on a declared visit to attend the Afghanistan conference, so the matter is very different from the nsa's secret meeting of the two countries which they have negotiated
 i had to bring it to Bangkok
 phir yah bhi dekha gaya he ki pichley saal sanyukt raashtra mahadhiveshan main hissaa lene neuyork pahunche pradhanmantri modi or nawaz shareef ek hi hotel main waldorph estoria main rahete hue bhi aapas main nahin mili
 Not formal but also informally
 isi tarah sushamaa swaraj or sarataaj azeej neuyork main hi aamane-saamne hone ke baavjood nahin mili
 After the Uri attack and then the surgical strike of India, the tension between the two countries, in such a situation, the emphasis of many countries of the world is that both countries cool the case
 yah ek mauqaa ho saktaa he jab donon deshon ke bich kuch baat kii gunjaaish bane
 The expectation is further heightened when both will be present within a hall during the conference
 uri or sargical strike ke baad yah pehla mauqaa he jab deshon ke mantri str ke rajaneta ek conference main maujuud honge
 Such an expectation is being expressed that in the last 48 hours, there have been two news reports between the national security personnel of both countries
 yah bhi kaha gaya ki is baatcheet main donon enese elosi par tanaav ghataane ko sahamat ho gaye haalanki yah khabar pakistan kii media ke hawaale se ai, lekin bhartiya videsh mantralay yaa enese ke daftar kii taraf se isaki aadhikarik pushti nahin kii gai, na hi is khabar se inkaar kiya gaya
 The comments ek tathy yah bhi he ki akbar or ajij brussels ke kisi gupachup daure par nahin hai balki afghanistan conference main hissaa lene ke liye ghoshit daure par hai isliye yah maamla donon deshon ke enese kii us gupachup mulaaqaat se bilkul alag he, jo unhone baatcheet ko patari par laane ke liye bangkok main kii thi
 Then it is also seen that Prime Minister Modi and Nawaz Sharif, who arrived in New York to attend the United Nations General Assembly last year, did not meet each other while staying in the same hotel in the Waldorf Istoria
 aupchaarik to dur anaupchaarik taur par bhi nahin
 Similarly, Sushma Swaraj and Sartaz Aziz did not meet despite being face to face in New York
 uri hamale or phir bharat kii sargical strike ke baad donon deshon ke bich jis tarah kaa tanaav he, aise main duniya ke kai deshon kaa jor is baat par he ki donon desh maamle ko thanda karen
 This may be an occasion when there is scope for some talk between the two countries
 aisi ummid isliye jataai ja rahi he ki pichley 48 ghanton main donon deshon ke rashtriya surakshakaron ke bich do baar baatcheet khabar ai he

 Just before pack-up a member of our # bucketlist unit played "lo chali main" As soon as we heard the music Madhuri and i got up instinctively and danced on the song
 The initiative of course was Madhuri's, her enthusiasm is so loveable and childlike and she's really ageing backwards i tell you and so we danced with abandon, all the people watching us and recording us were just a blur as we felt that warm and fuzzy feeling of working together in # HAHK 24 years ago, of creating beautiful memories not only in # HAHK but also in the present with # bucketlist
 Enjoy the video and don't forget to see the inimitable magic of Madhuri in our film # bucketlist releasing on the 25th of May
 Enjoyyy our # HAHK throwback video

 The triple talaq bill was to be discussed in the Rajya Sabha on Monday, the 12th day of the winter session of Parliament, but due to the uproar, the bill could not be introduced in the House
 congress samet kai vipakshi dal is vidheyak ko select cameti ke paas bhejne kii maang par ad gaye jiske baad hangaame kii vajah se sadan kii kaarywahi 2 janvari tak ke liye sthagit kerani padi
 The bill has been passed after voting in the Lok Sabha last week, but the challenge of passing it from Rajya Sabha to the Modi government still remains
 teen talaak bill ko select cameti ke paas bheje jane kii vipaksh kii maang par sarkaar ne aarope lagaaya ki vipaksh muslim mahilaon ke adhikaar se jude is vidheyak ko jaanboojhkar latakaana chahta he
 Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Vijay Goel said that the Congress which had earlier supported this bill has also stood in protest to avoid it today
 satta paksh or vipaksh ke apane-apane rukh par kaayam rahane ke kaaran is par charchaa nahin ho saki or hangaame ke kaaran kaarywahi do baar ke sthagan ke baad dopaher kareeb dhai baje puure din ke liye sthagit kar di gai
 Strong opposition on sending to the Select Committee Amid the uproar in the Upper House, Trinamool Congress MP Derek o'brien demanded that the Bill be sent to the Select Committee and said that if most opposition members want to send this bill to the Select Committee Why is the government not sending it? netaa pratipaksh gulam nabi aaazaad ne kaha ki yah ek aisa vidheyak he jo bahut se logon ke jivan ko sakaaratmak yaa nakaaratmak tareeke se prabhavit karegaa, lihaaja vidheyak ko joint select cameti main bhejkar is par vistaar se charchaa honi chahie
 He said that a proposal from the opposition has also been brought in this regard
 aaazaad ne sarkaar par aarope lagaaya ki vah sansadeey paramparaon kii andekhi kar adhiktar vidheyakon ko standing yaa select cameti main bheje bina inhen sidhe sansad main paarit karwaanaa chaahati he
 He said that the triple talaq bill was not referred to the Standing Committee in Lok Sabha
 gulam nabi aaazaad ne kaha ki yah muslim mahilaon se judaa ek ati mahatvapurn vidheyak he or ise select cameti main bhej kar is par charchaa karana jaruri he
 On this, Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Vijay Goel said that this is a very important bill related to the rights of Muslim women and the opposition wants to deliberately block this bill
 isiilie vah ise pravar samiti main bhejne kii maang kar rahaa he
 In the 'rajya Sabha is not rubber stamp' Deputy Congress leader Anand Sharma said that the Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs has alleged that the opposition is doing politics on this bill
 sharma ne kaha ki is maamle main raajnneeti sarkaar kar rahi he
 He said that Rajya Sabha is not a rubber stamp and this bill needs to be considered by the Parliamentary Committee
 unhone kaha ki puure vipaksh kii maang he ki yah vidheyak select cameti ko bheja jaae
 Amid the noise in the house, Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said that this matter is about humanity and humanity
 sarkaar is vidheyak par charchaa ke liye taiyaar he
 He said that even after the Supreme Court's decision, three divorce incidents are happening and till yesterday such incidents have taken place
 ucchtam nyaayalay ne apane ek mahatvapurn faisle main teen talaak (talaak e biddat) ko asanvaidhanik or gaiyr kanoonee ghoshit kiya tha
 'congress should not hang the bill' Law Minister Prasad said that the opposition should not hang the bill and participate in the discussion
 sarkaar unke sujhaavon ko sunne ko taiyaar he
 The Deputy Chairman once again appealed to the members to calm down and discuss the Bill
 lekin sadan main hangaamaa jari rahane par unhone kareeb dhai baje baithak puure din ke liye sthagit kar di
 In this way the triple divorce bill is hanging for 2 more days
 mangalvaar ko navvarsh kii vajah se rajyasabha kaa avkaash rahegaa
 In such a situation, in the remaining 5 meetings of the winter session before the Modi government, it has become a challenge to pass this bill from the upper house

 " CBSE board class 12th English core paper was released today
 puure bharat main is agzaam main 12,23, 291 chaatr-chaatro ne hissaa liya
 But today, seeing this very first paper of 12th class, the students were shocked
 is paper main 6 marks kaa ek aisa sawaal aayaa jo bacchon ke silebus main tha hi nahin
 Due to this one lapse from CBSE, now students and their parents are demanding Compensatory Marks for this question
 parents kaa kahana he ki class 12 sibiesai english kor paper (class 12 CBSE English Core paper) ke liye chaatro ko do kitaaben di jaati hai
 First H
 g Wells kii The invisible man or duusari George Eliot kii Silas Marner
 Out of these two books, schools refer only one book to their students
 ab in mata-pita ke mutabik 2 march ko hue CBSE ke english kor paper main bina kisi chwwis ke donon kitabon ke sawaal die gaye, jise dekh bacchon main hadakamp much gaya
 As per CBSE there are two novels in 12th board
 Both que 11 & 12 needs to have 2 questions from each novel
 But 11th question comprised of only Silas Marner

 lekin is baar ek hi sawaal main ek hi kitaab ke Questions aae
 In such a situation, the children who did not read the second book, suffered a loss of number 6, ie out of syllabus
 ab in bacchon ke mata-pita maang kar rahe hai ki silebus se baahar aae is sawaal ke chalate CBSE ko 6 number dene chahie
 At the same time, while talking to NDTV, the CBSE official says that this is an 'unknown omission' and it will not affect the numbers of any child
 kyonki CBSE ke paas is tarah kii chook se nipatane ke liye apni kriyavidhi he, jisase bacchon ke final marks par koi asar nahin hota
 At the same time, now CBSE says that this news is being misleading

 mahamudabad ke rahane vaale purv vidhayak mohammad aamir mohammad khan ke pita 1957 main pakistan chale gaye the lekin inhone bharat main hi rukne kaa faisla kiya
 Did they become enemies of the "country"? Should former Indian cricket team captain Marhum Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi, his wife Sharmila Tagore and their children Saif, Soha and Saba be considered "enemies" of India? It may sound strange, but if a new bill introduced by the NDA government takes the form of law, then these questions will undoubtedly arise in the coming time
 vah bhi us vakt jab desh rashtrawaad, rajdroh or secular bharat main alpsankhyakon ko mili adhikaron par ek bheeshan bahes main ulajhaa padaa he
 After nearly 70 years of partition and more than 50 years of war with Pakistan, the government is trying to re-enact the law which intends to deal with two burning issues simultaneously & "enemy" and "property"
 "
 is disha main beeti 7 janvari ko ek adhyadesh laayaa gaya tha jise shatru sampatti (sanshodhan or manyakaran) vidheyak 2016 main parivartit kiya gaya or 9 march ko loksabhaa ne ise paarit kar diya he, baavjood iske ki congress, bijedy, tiemasi, tiares, eiemiem or arsapi ke netaaon ne is par virodh darj karavaaya tha
 Its goal is to rule the property that once belonged to a Pakistani citizen, even though the said person's legal heirs are Indians
 yah vidheyak mul shatru sampatti vidheyak, 1968 ko pichhali taarikh se sanshodhit karata he or 2005 main supreme court ke us faisle ko bhi khaarij karata he jisamen kaha gaya tha ki aisi sampattiyon ko rajasat karne kii prakriya main bhartiya nagarikon ke adhikaron kaa ulanghan nahin hona chahie
 On March 15, the Rajya Sabha has demanded that the bill be sent to the Select Committee for review
 kuch jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki yah vidheyak samanta ke sanvaidhanik adhikaar ke khilaaf he kyonki yah do kism ke bharatiyon ke bich fark karata he&ek jinke purakhe pakistan chale gaye the or duusare jo nahin gaye
 Congress MP Shashi Tharoor had said in the Lok Sabha, "it will affect the rights of millions of Indian citizens
 saaf shabdon main kahen to sidhe musalmaan samudaay ko prabhavit karegaa
 It is his property that moved to Pakistan and it is a matter of the same community and according to me it is not only unconstitutional & it should be decided by the court & also against the principle of natural justice
 ” upie sarkaar ne aisa hi ek vidheyak 2010 main taiyaar kiya tha lekin uske netaaon, khaskar pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne vivaad ke maddenjar bill ko apni maut mar jane diya
 According to the previous census, the government has identified 15,143 "enemy properties" in 19 states including palaces, havelis, commercial buildings including houses and cultivated lands
 aisi sampattiyon kii sankhya 2011 main bamushkil 2,111 thi jo naatakeey dhang se bad gayi
 Of this, one lakh crore rupees
 kii anumaanit laagat vaali 9,400 sampattiyon ko rajasat karne or bharat main shatru sampattiyon ke castodian ke jikvame saunpane kii prakriya pehle hi puri kii ja chuki he
 The Bill since 1968 rejects the sale or transfer of "enemy property" by its successor
 inamen se kai log aise hai jinhen yah pataa hi nahin he ki unke paas jo sampatti he vah kabhi “shatru” kii thi
 According to the new provisions, the Government of India can sell these properties to a third person in its possession and there is no legal way to stop it
 sarkaar kii daleel he ki in sampattiyon ke rakrakhaav or mukademebaaji aadi kii prakriya se nipatane main use dikkat aa rahi he
 The government says that since these properties are of no use, it can transfer the money sold by them to the Consolidated Fund of India as Pakistan has already sold the properties of its Indian citizens
 pakistan ne yah prakriya 1971 main hi puri kar lee thi, haalanki bharat ke is kadam ko bharat ke vichaar ke khilaaf qaraar diya ja rahaa he or vidheyak ko “pratishodh kii karrwai” kaha ja rahaa he
 "what happened in another country should have no meaning for us," says Neeraj Gupta, a Supreme Court advocate and knowledgeable about cases related to "enemy property"
 hamaare paas apane kanoon hai
 People whose ancestors migrated to Pakistan but accepted to stay in India, is there any meaning? Instead of punishing the "enemy", are you not punishing your own people? " In other words, even if the exodus is considered a crime, how can you punish the sons for the sins of the father? Is the importance of elections? To understand this issue better, we in Lucknow, Sitapur and Uttar Pradesh One can take the example of Mahmudabad properties present in Nainital
 disambar 1957 main mahamudabad ke tatkaaleen raja mohammad aamir ahamed khan ne pakistan kii naagarikta le lee thi
 His wife Rani Kneez Abid and son Mohammad Aamir Mohammad Khan decided not to go there
 yah baat 1962 main china kii jang ke dauraan “shatru sampatti” kii avadharana laae jane se paanch saal pehle kii he, jab bharat main chini nagarikon kii sampattiyon ko asthaayee rup se ek castodian ke hawaale kar diya gaya tha taaki sunishchit kiya ja sake ki unka istemaal rajya ke khilaaf nahin hoga
 When the 1965 war broke out, the provisions of the three-year-old order were extended to Pakistan and as a result the property of Mahmudabad was taken over by the Central Government
 raja kii 1973 main landan main maut ho gai
 His sons were then studying astrophysics in Cambridge
 ve bharat laute or yachika daayar kii ki sarkaar unke pita kii sampatti waapas kare kyonki ve apane pita ke kanoonee uttaradhikari or bhartiya naagarik hai
 Mohammad Aamir Mohammad Khan, a two-time MLA from Congress in 1985 and 1989, kept on requesting the government to leave his assets for the next 24 years but no solution was found
 aakhirkaar unhone bombai hycourt main 1997 main ek rit yachika daayar kii kyonki shatru sampattiyon ke castodian kaa daftar mumbai main he
 He won the case in 2001, after which the NDA government challenged the High Court order in the Supreme Court, but Aamir won the case again in 2005
 supreme court ne apane aadesh main kaha ki centre sarkaar 1973 se unki sampatti par avaidh kabja kiye hue thi
 The most important of these properties are the Mahmudabad Fort on the outskirts of Lucknow, the Butler Palace in Lucknow, the residence of the Collector and Superintendent of Police in Sitapur and the Hotel Metropol in Nainital and were given to them
 lakhanu ke hajratganj kii kuch or sampattiyon ko pratikatmak rup se hi choda gaya haalanki kirayedari se jude kuch vivaadon ke chalate unka kabja aamir ko nahin mil sakaa
 The entire system, however, went awry in 2010 when the UPA government tried to rewrite the original Enemy Property Act of 1968 from the previous date by bringing an ordinance
 castodian ke agent ek baar phir mahamudabad kii sampatti ko kabjane main lag gaye or adhyadesh lambit ho jane ke baad bhi parivaar ko ye sampatti vaapis nahin kii
 Aamir once again reached the court
 pehle dilli hycourt or phir uttarakhand hycourt, jiske baad maamla supreme court bheja gaya
 The matter was to be heard on 7 January 2016 but on the same day the NDA government issued an ordinance to amend and validate the law from the previous date
 72 varshiya mohammad aamir mohammad khan kehete hai, “mujhe takalif is baat se nahin he ki meri sampatti daanv par lagi he balki is maamle se jo vyapak sandesh ja rahaa he, vah chintajanak he
 Am i facing all this because i am the son of a man who once supported Pakistan but changed completely later? Am i cursed because i am a Muslim or was i born in a feudal family? " He says, "of course i am everything from my birth, but i have chosen to be an Indian citizen, so i am equal in the eyes of the Constitution and the law like any other Indian
" nayaa vidheyak lakhon bharatiyon par asar daalega, bhrashtachar ke raste kholegaa or supreme court samet sabhi nyaayik sansthaanon kaa makhul banaakar rakh degaa
 Mahmudabad's property is just one example
 sarkaar kii manshaa is adhyadesh ke aane se saal bhar pehle hi saaf ho gai thi jab 19 disambar 2014 ko castodian ne 1968 ke kanoon kii dhara 11 ke tahat saf ali khan ko notice jari karke poocha tha ki unhen viraasat main mili bhopal estate kii jaaydaad ko kyon na “shatru sampatti” mana jaae? iske baad farvari 2015 main castodian ne ise “shatru sampatti” ghoshit bhi kar diya, is aadhaar par ki bhopal ke tatkaaleen nawab hamidulla khan kii sabase badi beti aabida sultan&pratishthit rajanyik or cricket prashaasak shehryaar khan kii maa&1950 main pakistan chali gai thim
 Despite this, Abida Sultan disassociated himself from his legacy and property which his sister Sajida Sultan inherited
 ve mansoor ali khan pataudi kii maa or iklauti vaaris thim
 The transfer of this heritage was officially recognized by the President of India in 1961
 bhopal kii sampatti castodian dwaara kabjae jane ke khilaaf saf court se roak lagava chuke hai
 Saif's lawyer Rajesh Pancholi says, "despite the new bill, property cannot be declared as enemy property
" jab bharat ke raashtrapati ne sajidah sultan ko mili viraasat par muhar lagaai he, to castodian kaise notice yaa uskaa ulanghan karne vaala aadesh jari kar saktaa he?” bhopal main 5,000 pariwaron kaa ek or samooh he jo is bill se prabhavit ho saktaa he
 The group has formed the Ghar Bachao Sangharsh Samiti and is advocated by Jagdish Cantonment, which says that more than 10,000 acres of land is involved in the case
 unke kuch muvakkilon ne beete paanch dashakon ke dauraan jaaydaad kharidi he jis par khatra paidaa ho gaya he kyonki nayaa vidheyak “shatru sampatti” kii pichhali sari kharid-farokht ko khaarij karata he
 Understand it as if you had purchased the property after testing the ownership of the seller and after examining all the horse trading, you have come to the conclusion that there is no reason to consider it as "enemy property"
 , Even if at some point this property has been with someone who was or has become a Pakistani, then you can take that property away
 bijedy ke saansad pinaki mishra ne loksabhaa main sawaal uthaaya tha, “pachaas saal main saikadon baar kharid-farokht hui hogi
 You will also dismiss them all and leave no legal way for anyone? Can this Parliament make such a law? It invites a petition under Article 226 to be filed immediately and it will be stayed on the very first day! ”some other important properties include a land in Shahbari village in Gautam Budh Nagar which was sold in 1968 but is now custodian
 Has taken ek sampatti hyderabad ke rangareddy jile main he jise castodian ne kabja liya he, baavjood iske ki uske chaar maalikon main se keval ek hi pakistan gaya tha
 Permanent Enemy? While putting the bill in Parliament, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh tried to quell the allegations that the bill is anti-minority and said that the bill would also apply to the property of Chinese citizens
 sawaal he ki kya sthaayee dushman jaisi koi cheez hoti he? aaj raashtra-rajya ke rajnatik dhaanche ke bheetar saajheedaar or pratidwandvi hote hai, gathjod banate hai or manmutav hote hai, lekin inaki paribhaasha samay ke saath badalati rahati he
 Britain and Germany were enemies during the war but today are partners on the fronts
 bharat or pakistan kii paidaaish bhale hi 1947 main judawaan ganatantron ke rup main hui or tab se seemaa par aatankwaad kaayam he, iske baavjood hamaara rishta koi khaas alag nahin he
 Our Prime Minister communicates for trade, sports and administrative restoration
 is vidheyak kii sthaayee prakruti haalanki yah maanakar chalati he ki do desh hamaare dushman the or rahenge
 If India gets into a war with a third country or gets into a situation where it has to consider another country as its enemy, then will the assets of the people of that country also be seized? Pushed forward when his MP from Rajasthan P
P
 pi
 Chaudhary said that the assets of people convicted of treason should also be added to the bill
 unhone kaha, “rajdroh ke doshi vyakti ko bhi “shatru” mana janaa chahie or uski sampatti ko is vidheyak ke praavdhaanon ke daayre main laayaa janaa chahie
 "so the Enemy Property Bill will be such a tool in the hands of this government, with the help of which it can take action against anyone whom it believes to be involved in treason?" The government will have to answer these questions, in Parliament or in court
 koun dushman he, koun nahin, yah aane vaale dinon kii ek jhalak bhar he

 ek or bada masalaa he emopi yani memorondom of procigers (mop) kaa
 The issue is also to bring more transparency and accountability in the collegium system with the appointment of judges and Chief Justices in the High Courts and the appointment of judges in the Supreme Court
 sarkaar kii ore se banaaye gayi engeesi yani rashtriya nyaayik niyukti ayog ko dharashayi karne ke baad collegium system ko zyada paardarshee banane par jor diya jane laga

 isamen senior jajon ko decignet karne kii prakriya main bhi zyada paardarshita laane ko lekar baat hui
 The Chief Justice did not like it

 darasal jajon kii niyukti ke maamle main donon hi paksh yani sarkaar or supreme court chaahate hai ki ye adhikaar unke paas rahe
 In such a situation, it was also said that the court should retain the right of appointment, but its rules should be codified so that the collegium, following them, appoints judges in the higher judiciary
 yani un tamaam binduon par jahaan samvidhan or supreme court kii niyamavali maun he, vahaan sarkaar auranyaaypalikamilakar paardarshita or javabdehi ke saath sarvamaanya niyam bana sakati he
 It is said that till now the intention of both the Supreme Court and the government is that they should get the right to appoint judges, but no one is interested in how people can be made judges
 jaj banaaye ja rahe log isapad ke yogyahain bhi yaa nahin isaki phikr kisi ko nahin hai
 Yes, everyone wants to give appointment letters, so transparent rules should be set to avoid these charges

 Pakistan violates ceasefire, Indian army is giving a befitting reply
 Pakistan is not deterring its antics
 pakistan jammu-kashmir main elosi ke paas shuukravaar subah sijafire kaa ulanghan kiya
 Mortars were fired from Pakistan in Krishnaghati sector of Poonch district near the Line of Control (loc)
 is firing membhartiya sena kaa ek javanghayal hua, jo ilaaj ke dauraan shahid ho gaya he
 However, the Indian Army is giving a befitting reply to this action of Pakistan

 In which one civilian was killed while more than a dozen people were injured
 aatankwaadiyon ne bazaar ke ilaake main grenade phenkaa tha
 The attack took place a week after the terrorist attack in Sopore town in north Kashmir
 jisamen 15 naagarik ghayal hue the
 At the same time, in the last week of October, Pakistan violated the ceasefire in the Balakot sector on the loc
 jisamen bharat ke do jawan shahid hue the vahiin ek aam naagarik kii maut ho gai thi
 After this, India had destroyed three terrorist camps in Pakistan in retaliation

 Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav has started laying political ground for the Lok Sabha elections
 is kadi main sapa ne aaj lakhanu ke party karyaalay main ahm baithak bulaai he
 Party leaders from all 403 assembly seats in the state have been called to this meeting
 vidhansabha chunaav main congress ke liye chodi gai siton se bhi party netaaon ko baithak main bulaayaa gaya he
 This means that the SP is currently preparing for all the 80 Lok Sabha seats in the state
 sapa kii is baithak main pradesh bhar ke party jila adhyaksh or vidhansabha chunaav main jite hui vidhayak or haare hui pratyaashee bulaae gaye hai
 Apart from this, the candidates declared from the seats which were left to Congress due to the alliance are also invited to this meeting
 is baithak main kareeb 1000 party netaaon ke shaamil hone kii sambhaavna he
 Will the sp-congress friendship break? This SP meeting is being seen as an exercise for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 sapa apane netaaon or party kaaryakartaaon se kshetra ke siyaasi maahaul ko samajhane or uske baad ranneeti banane kii kavayad main he
 The question is, is there any indication that the sp's invitation to the leaders from the seats left for Congress in this meeting is not on the path of separation between the boys of UP? The public has not accepted the friendship of the UP boys
 The state's 2017 assembly elections were fought jointly with SP and Congress
 akhilesh yadav or rahul gandhi kii jodi ko upi ke ladke kaa naam diya gaya tha, lekin janata se is dosti ko kubul nahin kiya
 Both the SP and the Congress suffered a crushing defeat in the assembly elections
 iske baad sapa ke sangrakshak mulaayam singh yadav or shivpal yadav ne party kii haar ke liye congress se dosti ko jimmedaar tehraaya tha
 Congress did not attend sp's EVM meeting, Akhilesh, however, was chanting the friendship with Rahul regardless of anyone
 wo 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main ek bade gathbandhan ke saath utarane kii baat khule dil se kehete rahe hai
 Recently, a meeting was called by the SP regarding evms, in which party chief Akhilesh Yadav sent a memorandum to all political parties
 sapa kii is EVM kii baithak main congress ne bada jhatka diya or wo shaamil nahin hui
 The meeting was attended by only small political parties
 congress ne akhilesh ko is baithak ke liye mahaj naitik samarthan kaa ek patr bhej diya
 The absence of Congress in this SP meeting was a big setback for Akhilesh
 upachunaav main saajha ummidavaar utaarne ko laga bada jhatkhilesh yadav kii EVM baithak ko phulpur or gorakhpur main saajha ummidavaar utaarne ke ek litmus test ke taur par bhi dekha ja rahaa tha
 Because from the very beginning, there has been a question of having shared candidates in both these seats
 lekin is main congress or basapa jaise dal shaamil nahin hue, jisase ye baithak feeki rahi
 This has also caused a big setback to the nomination of a common candidate
 ek tasviir main unhone kaale rang kii dress pahani he
 This dress is amazing in itself, she herself looks fabulous in it
 unhone ise do din pehle post kiya tha or tab se ab tak yah lagaataar share or post ho rahi he

 achaanak desh kii bhrashtachar virdohi ladaai ke do swayambhu brands ambeseder bachaav kii mudra main aa gaye hai
 Father Shantibhushan and son Prashant Bhushan have devoted their entire lives to creating their image of Mujahids in the fight being fought by the general public against governments, corporate houses and corrupt politicians
 haal hi main bhrashtachar ke khilaaf or raajnneeti kii gandagi ko apni jaadu kii chadi ghumaakar khatm karne ke lielokapalake rup main eemaandaaree ke ek pratik ko niyukt karwaane ke paksh main anna hajaare ke andolan ke dauraan in donon kaa naam sabase upar pahunch gaya tha
 But when such a CD came out, which had a conversation record of Shanti Bhushan and politicians Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh, their reputation started to come under fire
 is sidi main vidhwans kar dene vaali ek pankti thi
 One voice of Shanti Bhushan reportedly says: "prashant manages very well
 
 
 iske liye bahut zyada paise kii jarurat nahin he
 Four crore rupees is a lot
 ''iske baad bhushan pitaputra turant javaabi hamale kii mudra main aae
 He claimed that the CD was created by manipulating the value of his jihad against corruption
 prashanth ne ek press conference main ghoshnaa kii ki unke pita kabhi amar singh se nahin mili, jaisaa ki sidi main daawa kiya gaya he
 Three days later Amar Singh also held a press conference and claimed that he had brought Father Bhushan on a chartered plane to Lucknow on 28 February 2006 to advocate the Samajwadi Party in a case of defection
 unka kahana tha, ''main us maamle par charchaa ke dauraan vakilmuvakkil baithak kaa hissaa tha
 We paid him 30 lakhs for two muscles
 kaa bhugtan kiya, lekin jab unhone kaha ki ve prati peshi ke 25 lakh ru
 If we take them we will get 20 lakhs
 or die
 "then he said with a smile," Hopefully, he must have given the details of this money in the income tax return of 2006; Otherwise it would have become black money
 ''dilli police ne vah sidi jaanch ke liye kendriya aparaadh vigyaan prayogshaala ko bhej di he
 It is learned that in the initial government report, he has been told the real CD
 uski ek prati dobaaraa jaanch ke liye chandigarh kii sarkari prayogshaala main bheji jaaegi
 Bhushan Pitaputra has already produced certificates from two private criminology laboratories which claim that the CD has been manipulated
 ladaai main kabhi haar nahin maanane vaale amar singh is sidi ko duniya bhar kii saat prayogshaalaon main bhej chuke hai
 But Bhushan Pitaputra vs Amar Singh is just an entertaining side of this spectacle
 asli maamla to yah he ki bhrashtachar virdohi abhiyaan main sarvaadhik janemaane brands naamon ke haath bhi kya usee galaajat main sane hue hai, jiske khilaaf ve lard rahe hai
 The case of this CD went into the background when it was reported that Bhushan Pitaputra had defrauded the Uttar Pradesh government
 aarope lage ki elahabaad main 7,818 varg meter ke ek plot par, jise bhushan pitaputra ne pichley saal ek lakh ru

 Pitaputra earned Rs 6,66,000
 kii stamp duty di thi
 But according to the ongoing circle rate, this stamp duty 1
 33 karod ru
 It sits
 un logon ke liye jo unhen maanate hai, prashanth kaa daawa tha ki stamp duty ke saath hi, jisaki gananaa unhone kiraaya niyantran kanoon ke tahat pattedaar sampatti ke aadhaar par kii thi, unhone yah bhi kaha tha ki ve bakaayaa raashi kaa bhugtan kar denge
 Like Congress General Secretary Digvijay Singh, those who expressed doubt about his statement were sent a defamation notice

 After this, the Noida land episode came up
 janvari, 2009 main noida praadhikaran ne ''krishi bhoomi par farmahouse ke vikaas ke liekhulee yojana'' ke antargat shanti bhushan or unke putr jayant ko noida main kheti kii jameen ke 10,00010,000 varg meter ke do plot aavantit kiye the
 Jayant, who is a lawyer by profession, has appeared against Mayawati in the Noida statue scandal
 pitaputra donon ne is yojana ke tahat aavedan kiya tha
 According to the PIL filed by another allottee, the price of each farmhouse plot is 3
 5 karod ru
 And the allottees at the time of allotment are just 10 per cent i
e
 Rs 35 lakh
 chukaane the, baaki kii rakam 16 kishton main deni thi
 Ironically, Shanti Bhushan, despite being questioned about the transparency of such schemes, says that this challenge should be given not by himself but by those who have not got the plot under the scheme
 '' raajnneetikon ne is tarah kii manogat naitikta ko aade haathon liya he
 Mohan Singh of the Samajwadi Party raises the question, "if they knew that bribe was given in these allotments, why did they accept it?" Prashant led the movement in which the declaration of his assets to the judges There was a demand to do it, but now the declaration of his own property has backfired
 boforce or narmada baandh ke maamalon ke alaava dilachasp to janhit ke un muddon kii suchi he, jin ko lekar prashanth ne mukademe lade hai

 But now questions are also being raised in civil society
 supreme court ke vakil rajivdhawan kehete hai, ''bhushan pitaputra ko bahut gaur se sochna chahie or yah tay karnaa chahie ki lokapal bill zyada mahatvapurn he yaa unki khud kii pratishtha yaa ye donon chijen ekadusre se judi hai? nishchit taur par sampattiyon ke mukaable aay ke ujagar hone se logon main kuch kadar avishvaas kii bhaavana paidaa ho gai he or janhit yachikaaon kaa yah karnadhaar us andolan se bada nahin he, jiskaa vah hissaa he

 agar ham raajnneetikon ke liye koi maandand chaahate hai to hamen bhi vaisaa hi maandand apnaanaa hoga
 "bhushan Pitaputra's face was plagued with controversy only when his names were announced in the Lokpal committee
 pehla gola yoga guru baba ramdev ne daaga tha, jinhone pita or putr donon ko shaamil kiye jane ko parivaarwaad qaraar diya tha
 According to a source present in the committee, Shanti Bhushan had responded to him by saying that "it requires law experts, not yoga gurus
" '' lekinbhushan pitaputra ke liye vivaad koi nai baat nahin he
 Being human biased, they have to walk on a double-edged sword
 prashanth ne yadi lekhika arundhati roy par lage deshadroh ke aaropon ke maamle main unki abhivyakti ke adhikaar kaa bachaav kiya to shanti bhushan ne afjal guru kii faansee kii sajaa ke khilaaf raashtrapati ko patr likhakar daawa kiya ki vah mukhya abhiyukt nahin tha balki mahaj sajeesh main shaamil tha
 Prashant is also facing contempt of court as he said that half of the last 16 Chief Justices of the country were corrupt

 The ELISA (enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay) test used to test for bloodborne infections throughout Maharashtra is not fully capable of screening new infections
 gauratlab he ki raktadata ke khun ko kisi bhi marij ko chadhaane se pehle us khun kii kai jaanchen kii jaati hai
 These include tests such as HIV and Hepatitis by ELISA
 aise main yadi raktadata kaa sankraman nayaa ho, to vah is jaanch main saamne nahin aa paata
 This requires NAT (nucleic acid test), which is rarely available in hospitals
 elaija main nae sankraman kaa pataa nahin chalane par sankramit khun hi marij ko chadha diya jaataa he
 Thus, during the last five years, only 1000 people have been infected with HIV due to blood transfusion in Maharashtra alone

 If the new infection is not detected in ELISA, the infected blood is offered to the patient
 aise main pichley paanch saalon ke dauraan keval maharashtra main hi sankramit khun chadaaye jane se 1000 log echivi ke shikaar hue hai
 However, testing with NAT is expensive
 jahaan elaija test kii keemat kareeb 50 rupye prati unit he, vahiin NAT kii keemat kareeb 1200 rupye prati unit he
 The comments vartmaan main sabhi sarkari blad bainkon main elaija test hi kiya jaataa he

 iske saath hi khun main maujuud virus kii alp maatra kaa bhi pataa lag jaataa he
 In this test, infection of up to 1-34 days is also revealed
 dilli ke AIIMS aspataal kaa daawa he ki vahaan khun kii jaanch NAT dwaara hi kii jaati he
 The Maharashtra government is also claiming to provide NAT facility at 6 medical centers in the state in a few months, but till then the blood transfusion will continue to be investigated in this manner and there will be a risk of blood transfusion to the patients

 An example of the extent to which the magic of Narendra Modi has fallen on the BJP leaders was seen in a party program when the Gujarat cabinet minister in his speech gave Narendra Modi the post of Congress leaders of the Congress after the independence of the country
 Told the first choice
 gauratlab he ki narendra modi kaa janm hi desh kii aazaadee ke teen saal baad 1950 main hua tha or khud pradhanmantri modi is baat ko kai baar apane bhaashan main kah chuke hai ki wo aazaadee ke baad janme desh ke pehle pradhanmantri hai
 This incident is from Porbandar where BJP organized a program on the occasion of Gujarati New Year

 Addressing the people present here, Babu Bokharia said that when the country became independent in 1947, most of the Congressmen wanted Narendra Bhai Modi to become the Prime Minister
 patel kii jagah niklaa modi kaa namadarasal babu bokharia kahana chaahate the kicongressi sardaar patel ko pradhanmantri dekhnaa chahtethe lekin unke munh se narendra modi kaa naam nikal gaya
 Narendra Modi was born on September 17, 1950, that is, three full years, one month and two days after independence
 gauratlab he ki gujarat main chunaavon kaa elaan ho chukaa he or bijepi va congress ke bich jabardast ghamaasan chhidaa hua he

 gujarat main 18 fisadi patel vot hai or bijepi ke patel prem kii ek ye bhi badi vajah bataai jaati he
 In this sequence, Babu Bokharia too made a mistake in trying to surround the Congress

 On the morning of Saturday, April 13, when 51-year-old Jaya Prada, MP from Rampur, came out in his steel gray color Fortuner, the glowing red light on his car passed through all the cities went unnoticed
 lekin paune teen baje ke aasapaas jaise hi gaadi ajam khan ke ilaake rampur main daakhil hui to shahar ke atirikt kshetreey parivahan adhikari (eartio) kaushalendra yadav ne gaadi se na sirf laal batti utarava di, balki gaiyrkanoonee dhang se flashar ke istemaal ke liye 25,000 ru
 Also fined
 jaya pradaa ke mutabik yah unke siyaasi rakibon kii sajeesh he
 She says, "all this is done by Azam Khan
 ve log chaahate hai ki main yahaan se chali jaaun
 "she adds," he said that we are men
 tumko pataa nahin ki ham tumhaara kya haal karenge
 She does not, however, clarify to whom she refers to
 khud jaya ke shabdon main rampur ke raja ‘‘apni masculin (mardaana) power’’ dikhaakar daraa rahe hai
 But Kaushalendra Yadav has something else to say
 unke mutabik, ‘‘main to sirf niyam kaa paalan kar rahaa tha
 No leader, officer or minister is above the law
 jo bhi use todega, us par karrwai hogi
 Yadav says that according to the Central Motor Vehicles Rules 1989, members of the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha of Uttar Pradesh are not allowed to use the red light with a flasher on the front of a private vehicle and Jaya Prada violated the rule
 bakaul yadav unhone do maheene pehle bhi ek baar jaya pradaa ko flashar ke prayog ke liye chetavanee di thi
 He says, "the flasher was burning when his car entered the city
" ’’saansad kaa kanuunan flashar lagaana sahi he yaa galat, is sawaal par uttar pradesh ke parivahan mantri durga prasad yadav golmol uttar dete hai, ‘‘maamle kii jaanch ho rahi he
 Whatever the rules are against, action will be taken against them
 ’’ yah poochne par ki jaya pradaa kii car rampur main hi kyon roki gai, durga prasad vahi rata-rataya uttar doharaa dete hai, ‘‘maamle kii jaanch kii ja rahi he
 Jaya Prada has also accused Kauslendra Yadav of indecent behavior
 lekin ve aise kisi bhi aarope se inkaar karte hai, ‘‘ghatana ke turant baad jab unhone press conference kii to haath pakadaaey yaa abhadra vyavhaar karne kaa koi aarope nahin lagaaya
 They are trying to give political color to this incident
 ’’ kaushalendra jaya pradaa ko chunauti dete hue kehete hai, ‘‘agar jaya apane bete kii kasam khaakar kahen ki maine unke saath abhadra vyavhaar kiya he to main apni naukari se istipha de duungaa
 But if you come with a flasher light, i will remove it again
 ’’laal batti ke istemaal se shuru hui yah ladaai rampur se hote hue ab dilli ke siyaasi galiyaaron main pahunch chuki he
 Jaya Prada met Lok Sabha Speaker Meira Kumar
 amar singh ne bhi is mudde main hastkshep karne kii maang karte hue pradhanmantri manmohan singh ko ek patr likhaa he
 In a special interview with India Today, Amar Singh called it Azam Khan's political conspiracy against Jaya Prada
 ve kehete hai, ‘‘akhilesh yadav kii patni dimple yadav bhi sirf saansad hai or flashar vaali laal batti main gumti hai
 "they say," Jaya Prada is getting punished for many things
 apni party ke khilaaf jaakar meraa saath dene kii, ajam khan ke ilaake main unke virodh or dushprachaar ke baavjood baari maton se chunaav jeetne kii or stri hone kii
 Despite the fact that Jaya Prada has violated the rule, the question arises again and again why only he is on target? Why is the target also in Rampur only? There can be no denying that even though there are mps from Jaya Prada, the rule in Azad Khan is in Rampur
 rampur uttar pradesh kaa shaayad iklauta shahar he, jahaan niyam-kanoonon kaa paalan hota he
 The bureaucracy always stands on one leg
 sadakon par dhundgaye se ek gaddha bhi nahin miltaa
 No auto driver drives without uniform and license
 sadak par trephic niyam se chalata he
 There is never a light in the city

 Only BJP can take care of the country, this is also an illusion
 sharnaarthi kahaan or kis pradesh main rakhe jaaenge
 All these things should be clear

 rajyasabha main congress ke 46, tiemasi ke 13, sapa ke 9, vamadal ke 6 or diemke ke 5 or argedy, ensipi or basapa ke 4-4 sadsy hai
 Apart from this, there are 2 members of TDP, 1 of Muslim League, 2 of PDP, 1 of JDS, 1 of Kerala Congress and 6 of TRS

 What is Khanty Bihar after all? Geographically, it is a flat and flat land spread over a large part of the Gangetic plain
 haalanki isamen bhugolic vividhta bhari padi he
 The north is a lush green area filled with abundant lakes and pools, while the south plain consists of hills
 badi nadiyaan ganga or kosi himalay se dakshin kii ore bahati hai to amarkanta paharipoon se son nadi uttar kii ore bahati he
 All three make the earth fertile
 ye bihar kii bhugolic pahchaan to hai hi, bihar kii samskruti kaa bhi amit hissaa hai
 Similarly, what is the Khanty identity of Bihar? Historically, the character of the region has been magnanimous and widespread like a metropolis
 bharat main raaj or samrajya kii sthapana kaa prarambh bhi chhathvin shatabdi main magadh janapad or uske teen sau saal baad maury samrajya se joda ja saktaa he
 Early historical Bihar has also been the father of great intellectual movements
 yahaan buddha or jain jaise vividh dharmon kaa sutarapaat hua jabaki baaki samoochaa aryaavart vaidic ruudhivaad main fansaa hua tha
 Diversity and opposition seem typical of Bihar's character
 so, aashcharya nahin ki haal ke daur main 1857 ke pehle swatantraaa sangram se lekar champaran satyagrah tak bihar aupniveshik raaj ke virodh kaa haraval dasta rahaa he
 Azad also became the leader of the movement against the Bihar Emergency in India
 bihar kaa shabdic arth bhi uske charitra se kuch alag nahin he
 It is a corruption of the word 'vihara' which means a Buddhist monastery
 yahaan buddha dharm kii aisi majboot pakad thi ki puure kshetra ko hi bihar kaha jane laga
 But the word 'vihara' dates back to the Buddhist era
 mahabharat main vihaar kaa arth anand sthal, manoranjan sthal se he
 Gradually in ancient India, this word was used in philosophical sense, which means life was taken from living in its entirety, depth
 hamen 'bihar' shabd kaa pehali baar zikr 13veen shatabdi main minhaj al siraaj jujajani kii likhi tabakat-e-nasiri main miltaa he
 But then the name was prevalent for South Bihar
 darasal, uttari bihar main buddha dharm kii maujuudagi dakshini hisse ke mukaable kamjor thi
 However, during the time of Muhammad bin Tughlaq (1325–51), both the northern and southern parts came to be known by the same name — Bihar
 tab vah tughlaq samrajya kaa ek praant hua karata tha
 In the recent times, however, Bihar is not recognized for its glorious past in the rest of India
 bihar ke bare main ek nakaaratmak dharna ban gai
 He became a symbol of backwardness and stagnation
 bollywood kii filmon se lekar tivi dharawahikon jaise lokapriy madhyamon main bihar kii chhavi pichhadepan or bhadesapan ke liye pesh kii jaati he
 Surprisingly, the same image of Bihar remains in the intellectual class as well
 ve uske in halaat kii do ahm vajahon ko bhula dete hai
 One, geopolitical conditions began to form in colonial rule in such a way that the traditional economy of certain areas was demolished in a planned manner
 aadhunik itihaaskaar yah bataaenge ki bihar ko 1857 ke vidroh main aguai karne kii kitni keemat adaa kerani padi
 Even in the post-independence period, the Center ignored Bihar in terms of resource allocation and infrastructure development and took a disproportionate share in the profits of its vast mineral resources (before 2000)
 kai baar to yah andeshaa hone lagata he ki bihar ke pichhadepan kii keemat par hi agrani rajyon kaa vikaas hua he
 Secondly, in degrading Bihar, the rest of India forgets that Bihar is similar to them, in the eyes of Britain or Australia, India has the same situation
 britain yaa australia main bharatiyon ke saath vahi vyavhaar hota he, jaisaa mumbai yaa dilli main bihariyon ke saath hota he
 However, in recent years, a new chapter has opened in Bihar and now a new awakening is coming in Bihar
 agar bihar pichhadta rahaa to bharat bhi vikaas nahin kar saktaa
 Now again come to that basic question, what is the Khanty character of Bihar or its specialty? What better to say than Mahatma Gandhi's quote on this subject
 gandhi ne apni aatmakatha satya ke mere prayog main sabhi bihariyon ke charitra kaa kuch aise varnan kiya he, ''vinamr, saral, bhale or agaadh shraddha vaale
 "they often called Bihar a" beautiful and holy place "or" the land of my dreams "
 kai baar bihar ke logon kii saadagi, do took bolne or gajab ke hasya bhav ko koi koi unka akkhadpan maan baithta he
 Hopefully, the newly awakened Bihar will be able to erase the negative image it has created in recent years and once again become 'anand Bhoomi' like its original meaning

 Only women follow this tradition but they are not listened to
 hamaara koi shatru nahin, lekin ham kisi ke shatru ho sakate hambhagwat ne kaha ki hamaare desh main raajnneeti ko lekar kai prayog hue
 Mahatma Gandhi envisioned politics based on truth and non-violence
 isi naitik bal ke kaaran hi desh angrejon ke khilaaf ekajute hua
 He said that we do not enmity anyone, but there are people who enmity us in the world
 isliye unke liye kuch to karnaa padegaa
 Nothing changed in pakistanmohan Bhagwat said that there was a change of power in Pakistan but there was no difference in his antics
 hamen itnaa balavaan hona padegaa taaki koi hamaare upar akraman karne kii himmat naa kar paae
 India's reputation has increased in the world in recent years
 unhone kaha ki hamane apana desh sarkaar ko nahin saunpa he, desh hamaara hi he
 The government does not do everything, it should speed up some work
 bina naam liye china ko bhi gheraavshshsh pramukh ne kaha ki pashchim bengal se lekar hind mahaasaagar tak kai dweep aise hai, jo samrik drushti se kaaphi ahm hai
 They should all be blocked
 duniya main aise kai desh hai jo bharat ko aage nahin badhane dena chaahate hai
 During this, he also targeted China without taking name
 unhone kaha ki kuch shaktiyaan maldive, srilanka ko apni taraf karne kii koshish kar rahi hai
 Home-made security goods, he said that the purchase of many types of security products is part of the business betting, now those who do not stop the way of transaction
 balki use is tarah chalaaen ki apni suraksha ke liye kisi par nirbhar naa rahen
 We should make security related things in our country itself
 desh ko andar se khokhla karnaa chaahati hai kuch shaktiyanmohan bhagwat bole ki abhi desh main kai tarah kii chintaaen he is bich hi kuch shaktiyaan desh ko andar se hi khokhla karnaa chaahati hai
 Due to some reasons, people of their own country also stand with these powers, these reasons need to be overcome
 desh main police kii haalat jaisi honi chahie waisi nahin he
 Talks of proposals for improving the police force are still dusting the files
 tukade gang par warasang pramukh ne kaha ki pichley kuch dinon main choti-choti baton ko lekar andolan hue jinhen bada bana diya gaya
