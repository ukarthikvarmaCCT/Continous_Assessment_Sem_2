 isro ne chandrayan-2 mishan kii kathinaaiyon ke bare main bataaya tha
 It was told that after launching the Indian scientist Chandrayaan-2, it is going to face seven kinds of problems till it lands on the moon
 haalanki, chandrayan-2 antariksh ke saat chakravyuuh main se 4 ko bhed chukaa he, ab sirf 3 hi baaki he
 On landing on the lunar surface on September 7, isro's Vikram Lander and Pragyan Rover will break the cycle of all the problems encountered in space
 isro vaigyanikon kii nipunata or chandrayan-2 kii takanic 7 sitambar ko desh kaa naam or sammaan puri duniya main ooncha karne vaale hai
 🇮🇳 # isromissions🇮🇳 # chandrayaan2the Challenges of Moon landingpic
 twitter
 com / mpmyc6vpgn — ISRO (@isro) June 3, 2019 These 4 Chakravyuhs of space problems have elapsed Chandrayaan first Chakravyuh: The distance of the moon from the Earth was about 3 lakh 84 thousand 400 km at the time of taking the right path
 itane lambey safar ke liye sabase jaruri sahi maarg (tregectory) kaa chunaav karnaa tha
 Because with the right trajectory, Chandrayaan-2 will have less impact on the gravity of the earth, moon and other objects coming in the way, solar radiation and the movement of the moon
 chandrayan-2 ne pehla chakravyuuh paar safaltaapurvak bhed liya he
 Second Chakravyuh: The radio signal was feared to be delayed due to the distance being far beyond the communication space in deep space
 lekin chandrayan-2 kii sabhi sanchaar pranali sahi tareeke se kaam kar rahi he
 He keeps on giving messages about his health in between
 ye chakravyuuh bhi chandrayan-2 bhed chukaa he
 Third Chakravyuh: Reaching the moon's orbit Chandrayaan-2 was not easy to reach the moon's orbit
 lekin, isro ke vaigyanikon ne lagaataar badalte orbital movement ke baavjood chandrayan-2 ko chand kii kaksha main 20 agast ko pahunchaa diya tha
 Scientists showed so much accuracy in doing this that the work was completed in less fuel
 teesraa chakravyuuh bhi chandrayan-2 ne bhed daalaa
 Chandrayaan-2, ready to land on the moon, click here to wish the best
 Chautchavrayah: Walking in the moon's orbit is not easy to walk around the moon for Chandrayaan-2
 iskaa bada kaaran he chand ke chaaron taraf gravity baraabar nahin he
 This affects the electronics of Chandrayaan-2
 lekin, chandrayan-2 ke orbitor or vikram lander donon chand ke chaaron taraf kushaltapurvak chakkar laga rahe hai
 The fourth Chakravyuh also broke Chandrayaan-2
 ab bas ye 3 chakravyuuh todna baaki he
 
 
 Fifth Chakravyuh: Soft landing on the lunar surface According to ISRO scientists, the biggest challenge is the soft landing of Chandrayaan-2's rover and lander on the moon
 chand kii kaksha se dakshini dhruv par rover or lander ko aaraam se utaarne ke liye propalshan system or onboard computer kaa kaam mukhya hoga
 All these works will be done automatically
 yahi wo chakravyuuh hai jiske liye isro vaigyanikon kii saansen thami hai, lekin unki ankhen sajag or dimag satark hai
 Sixth Chakravyuh: At the time of landing, there is a lot of pits, stones and dust on the surface of the dust flying from the moon
 jaise hi lander chand kii sataha par apana propalshan system on karegaa, vahaan teji se dhul udegi
 Dust can blow up and accumulate on the solar panel of the lander, thereby disrupting the power supply
 onboard computer ke sensors par asar pad saktaa he
 However, ISRO scientists have made all preparations to penetrate this cycle
 upaay khoja he ki landing ke samay 6 meter kii oonchai par pahunchane ke baad paanchon ingine ke bajaay sirf ek ingine chaalu rakhaa jayega
 So that the dust blows away
 saatvaan chakravyuuhah chand kii sataha par badalata tapamaanachaand kaa ek din yaa raat dharti ke 14 din ke baraabar hoti he
 Because of this, the temperature on the lunar surface changes rapidly
 isse lander or rover ke kaam main baadha aegi
 But, ISRO scientists hope that both the rover and the lander will withstand the moon's temperature comfortably

 shaadi kaa din har ladki ke liye bahut khaas hota he
 After seven rounds, she is tied to a new home and relationship
 dheron rasmon or rivaajon ke bich use har choti-badi baat kaa khyaal rakhana padataa he
 She keeps trying all the time not to let anything happen to her that causes anyone to feel bad
 ghar aae sabhimehamaanon ke liye wo centre-bindu hoti haiaise main sabhi ko khush rakh paanaa kaaphi mushkil ho jaataa he
 By avoiding these 5 things, she can reduce her problem
 1
 It doesn't matter how the relationship between you and your ex-boyfriend was in the past and how it is now
 bhuulakar bhi use apni shaadi main na bulaaen
 Even if they come without calling, they should not go to meet him
 2
 It is very important that you be as polite as possible in your marriage
 masti ke is maahaul main jab aapke aas-paas log sharaab pi rahe hon to aap aisa kuch bhi karne se bachein
 3
 ye baat bahut jaruri he ki apni shaadi ke din aap sundar dikhen par ye bilkul bhi mat sochen ki aap jitna adhik mechap karengi utani hi sundar dikhengi
 Applying too much makeup will definitely make you look not just beautiful but funny
 4
 Marriage is a long process
 jisamen aapako apana dhairya banaae rakhane kii jarurat he
 Hundreds of people will come to see you and you should meet them well
 aise main dhiraj banaae rakhana bahut jaruri he
 5
 shaadi ke vakt shikaayatein karne se bachein
 Often girls start complaining about small things
 shikaayat karke aap apana to mood kharaab karti hi hai saath hi baaki logon ko bhi bura mahasoos karaati hai

 Police have found important clues in the murder of a BSP leader, who is in Delhi's farmhouse
 police ne do shootaron ko hiraasat me liya he jabaki ghar ke kai sadasyon se bhi poochtacha kii ja rahi he
 Police say that she will disclose the slayer of this shootout soon
 bijness tykun deepak bharadwaj ke qatl ke maamle main police ne bahari dilli se do sharp shooters ko hiraasat main liya he
 At the same time, there is an increased possibility that Bhardwaj has been killed by the supari killers on a nearby island
 vaise bhi mangalvaar ko jis tarah tareeke se is vaardaat ko anjaam die jane kii baat saamne ai thi, usase itnaa to saafe tha ki qaatil deepak bharadwaj ko kisi bhi keemat par zindaa nahin rahane dena chaahate the
 This was the reason that before attacking Bhardwaj, the farm house was Reiki and then he was targeted by bullets from the Point Blanc range
 ames kii morchari main buudhvaar ko takreeban chaar ghante chale bharadwaj kii postmortem se bhi ye baat saaf ho gai
 Experts of forensic medicine recovered two bullets in his body
 ye goliyaan unke seene or sir ke pichley hisse main maari gai thi, jo jism main rah gai thim
 The police have sent the bullets in their possession for blastic examination, so that it can be found out which bore these bullets and from which they have been fired
 police is silsile main farm house main tainaat kuch security gards se bhi poochtacha kar rahi he
 Along with this, the details of Bhardwaj, his friends, relatives, security guards and mobile phones of all the people are being investigated
 is silsile main south dilli kii police ne das se zyaada timen banaai hai, jo dilli ke alag-alag ilaakon ke alaava haryana ke jind or uttarakhand ke liye ravaanaa kii gai hai
 On Wednesday, news of the Skoda car used in the murder of Deepak Bhardwaj was recovered from Jind in Haryana
 haalanki ek taraf jahaan haryana police ne is baat kii tasdik karne se inkaar kar diya, vahiin maamle kii jaanch kar rahi south dilli kii disipi chaaya sharma ne is baat se inkaar kiya
 It is obvious that in this high profile murder case, it has become a challenge for the police to reach the killer by adding other clues from CCTV footage

 This was enough to make you jittery
 This only shows your guilty conscience
 @ indiainpakistan — Chowkidar Sushma Swaraj (@sushmaswaraj) March 24, 2019 After the video went viral, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj summoned the report from the Indian High Commission in Pakistan
 iske alaava unhone pakistan ke mantri ko bhi twitor par latad lagaai thi

 iske jawaab main sushamaa ne kaha ki aapaki ghabrahat dikhaati he ki aap aparaadh bodh se grasit hai
 Action in this case has started in Pakistan after India's strong action
 sthaneey reports kii maane to abhi tak is maamle main 7 logon ko giraftaar kar liya gaya he
 In addition to the Crime Branch, an independent fact finding team has investigated the murder case of an 8-year-old innocent girl in Kathua, Jammu and Kashmir, after several days of gang-rape

 This team also visited Kathua and inspected the occasion and interacted with the people and prepared a report in their own way

 Therefore, a CBI inquiry should be done in this case, so that the truth can be revealed
 monica aroda kaa yah bhi kahana he ki ghatana sthal ko mandir bataaya ja rahaa he

 Accusing the SP government of insulting the poor people, he said that by virtue of being a follower of Lohia, it is not good for the society, but there is a need to share the pain of people by following the path shown by them, in which The SP government has failed
 verma ne kaha ki mulaayam unhen raajnneeti main laane vaale ramsevak yadav or aage badhaane vaale choudhary charan singh kaa naam bhuulakar us lohia kii baat karte hai, jinke kareeb tak ve kabhi pahunch nahin paye

 ’- input bhashaa While Gautam Gambhir, Karun Nair and Jayant Yadav have managed to retain their place in the Indian squad announced for the first two Tests against England, all-rounder Hardik Pandya is the new face of the team
 shikhar dhawan, keel rahul or rohit sharma chongrast hone ke kaaran team main jagah nahin bana paae hai vahiin chikangunia se ubarne ke baad ishanth sharma team main vaapasi karne main safal rahe hai
 In terms of Hardik Pandya, this young Gujarat man has been rewarded for his great performance in T20 and ODI as a place in the Test team
 vaise bhi team india ke fast bowler alrounder kaa sthaan lambey samay se khaali he
 At one time, Irfan Pathan used to sit at this place but due to the falling performance and injury, he had to leave the team
 is bich team prabandhan ne stuart binni jaise khilaadiyon ko is khaas sthaan ke liye aajamaaya lekin binni tej gendbaaji (?) ke lihaaj se behad saadhaaran sabit hue
 It is expected that Hardik Pandya will prove to be a good choice for the all-rounder's slot
 hardik ke paksh main khaas baat yah he ki ve 140 kimi ke aasapaas kii gati se genden phenkate hai or is kaaran unhen oochaal dene main bhi sakasham hote hai
 He also specializes in fielding and does well in batting
 haalanki tii20 or vanade kii kii style kii batting ke apane style main unhen badlaav laana hoga
 The most important thing in Hardik's favor is that he is just 23 years old and if he fits in the role of all-rounder in the Test, then he will be able to serve Indian cricket for a long time
 tippaniyan In his short one-year international career, Hardik has impressed the likes of Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Sunil Gavaskar
 vanade team ke captain dhoni to hardik kii pratibha ko itnaa khaas maanate hai ki is khilaadi ke debyue match main hi unhone pandya ko umesh yadav ke saath shuruyaat main gendbaaji ke liye utaar diya
 Former Team India captain Sunil Gavaskar also believes that there has been a lot of improvement in Pandya and hence great expectations can be expected from him
 NDTV se baat karte hue purv captain sunil gavaskar ne kaha tha ki 'pandya ek fost bowler olerounder kii kami ko puraa karte nazar aate hai
 When new breakthroughs are found, players often go astray, but are consistently bowling well
 unka fokas nazar aata he
 It is to be hoped that the words of Sunny will prove them right in a hearty test match
 
 
 hardik pandya ke lihaaj se baat karen to gujarat ke is yuva ko tii20 or vanade ke apane shandaar pradarshan kaa inaam test team main sthaan ke rup main mila he
 Anyway, Team India's fast bowler allrounder has been vacant for a long time
 ek samay irfan pathan is sthaan par makul baithte the lekin girte pradarshan or chongrast hone ke chalate unhen team se baahar hona padaa
 Meanwhile, the team management tried players like Stuart Binny for this particular position but Binny proved too mediocre in terms of fast bowling (?)
 ummid he ki hardik pandya harfanmaulaa ke slot ke liye acha vikalp sabit honge
 The special thing in Hardik's favor is that he throws balls at a speed of around 140 km and is also able to bounce him
 kshetrarakshan main bhi ve maahir hai or ballebaaji bhi acchhee kar lete hai
 However, they have to change their style of batting style of T20 and ODI
 hardik ke paksh main sabase mahatvapurn baat yah he ki unki umr mahaj 23 saal he or yadi ve test main alrounder ke role main feet baithe to bhartiya cricket ko lambey samay tak seva dene main safal rahenge
 The comments apane ek saal ke kam samay ke international kariyar main hardik ne mahendra singh dhoni or sunil gavaskar jaise diggajon ko khaasaa prabhavit kiya he
 Dhoni, the captain of the ODI team, considers Hardik's talent so special that in this player's debut match, he landed Pandya for bowling with Umesh Yadav in the beginning
 team india ke purv captain sunil gavaskar bhi maanate hai ki pandya main pehle se bahut sudhaar aayaa he or isliye unase badi ummiden kii ja sakati hai
 Speaking to NDTV, former captain Sunil Gavaskar said that 'pandya seems to be filling the lack of a fast bowler all-rounder
 jab nai kamyaabi milti he to aksar khilaadi bhatak jate hai, lekin lagaataar acchhee gendbaazi kar rahe hai
 His focus is visible
 ' ummid kii janaa chahie ki sani ke in shabdon ko hardik test match main bhi sahi sabit karenge

 unhone kaha ki pavaar agar khud se istipha nahin dete hai to shashan main shuchita kii baar-baar baat karne vaale singh ko unhen barkhaast karnaa chahie
 Prasad termed these arguments of Pawar as 'few arguments' that the Pune team had been bid 'in person' not by City Corporation but by its managing director Anirudh Deshpande
 unhone pavaar kii is daleel ko bhi haasyaaspad bataaya ki deshpandey ne kaha tha ki safal boli lag jane par vah use kisi duusari company ke naam par lenge

 amit shah ne kaha, 'desh jab aam chunaav kii ore teji se bad rahaa he or desh ke matadaataaon main raashtra suraksha kaa mudda ahm bana hua he
 In such a situation, the statement of Sam Pitroda, who was in charge of foreign affairs of the Congress, is very unfortunate
 ' amit shah ne sawaal kiya ki desh ko jhakzor kar rakh dene vaale pulavama jaise jaghanya hamale ko kya congress party saamaanya ghatana maanati he?kya ghatnaon kaa PAK se rishta nahin he?sam pitroda ke bayaan par bijepi adhyaksh shah ne kaha, 'kya congress party maanati he ki jo aatankwaadi ghatnaayen hui hai, unka pakistan se sambandh nahin he? bijepi adhyaksh sawaal karte hue kaha ki aatanki hamale kaa jawaab sargical strike or air strike se nahin balki baatcheet se dena chahie, kya yahi congress party kii aatankwaad se nipatane kii adhikrut niti he? bhartiya janata party ke rashtriya adhyaksh ne aage kaha ki desh main is prakaar ke aatanki hamale hote hai, desh ke naagarik hataahat hote hai, desh ke jawan shahid hote hai or congress party or unke padaadhikari baatcheet kaa rasta sujhaate hai

 'BJP will respond to terror,' he said, 'I demand from the Congress President that you apologize to Sam Pitroda's statement to the country, the family of the martyrs and the brave soldiers of the country
 amit shah ne kaha ki vah desh kii janata ko vishwaas dilaanaa chaahate hai ki bijepi hi is desh ko suraksha de sakati he, aatankwaad ko munhtod jawaab de sakati he or pakistan kii sajishon ko naakaam kar sakati he

 chhattisgarh ke bilaspur main nagar nigam ne khule main shouch karne waalon ke khilaaf abhiyaan ched rakhaa he
 But what the corporation's staff did to the open defecators is under question
 aise kareeb darjan bhar logon ko sajaa dene ke taur par jungle vaali gaadi main kaid kar shahar bhar main ghumaya gaya jiskaa istemaal aawaara kutton yaa duusare jaanwaron ko pakad kar shahar se baahar chhodane ke liye kiya jaataa he

 To push, sometimes people are being driven in an animal cart

 According to the news of the English newspaper 'the Hindu', Maktumhusain's lawyers have advised him to go to the Supreme Court

 While the soldier considered it 'discrimination', he appealed against the rule in the Karnataka High Court

 There the new CO also asked Maktumhusain to shave his beard

 Although no initiative has been taken so far by JNU to present or give information about the students, the police have received information that 80-90 people were involved in the slogans
 inamen bahari koun tha ye 
 
 ab tak saaf nahin hua he
 Based on the video footage of the program 'A Country Without a Post Office' held at JNU on 9 February, the police have identified five more students shouting anti-national slogans

 madhya pradesh main 15 varshon baad sarkaar main ai congress jahaan bijepi sarkaar ke dauraan hue mandsaur golicond main police kii bhoomika ko sahi tehraakar vivaadon main aa chuki he, to vahiin congress ko narmada yatra ke dauraan hue paudharopan maamle main bhi vidhansabha main apane die gaye jawaab ke chalate purv mukhyamantri digvijay singh kii naaraazgi kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 In fact, the Congress has admitted in its reply in the Legislative Assembly that no disturbance has been done by the BJP government in the plantation during the Narmada Yatra, while the Congress has done the investigation of the scam in the plantation case
 kya sachmuch shivaraj singh chouhan ke shashan main hui narmada yatra ke dauraan hue paudharopan main koi gadabadi nahin hui he? ye sawaal isliye uth rahaa he kyonki ab tak yah daawa bijepi karti ai thi lekin ab yah daawa koi or nahin khud 15 varshon baad satta main ai congress kii sarkaar kar rahi he
 Umang Singhar, the forest minister in the Congress government, during the question asked in the Legislative Assembly has admitted that the government has not found any disturbance in the plantation done on the banks of Narmada
 sarkaar kaa yah jawaab aate hi congress ke purv mukhyamantri digvijay singh ne sarkaar ke mantriyon ko hi katghare main khadaa kar diya
 Digvijay Singh said that 'I myself have visited Narmada for 6 months, during this time he did not see a single plant, so how did the minister of the department admit that there was no scam
 kam se kam unhen congress kaa vachanapatr to padhanaa chahie tha
 Computer Baba is also angry, former Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan started the Narmada Seva Yatra on 11 May 2016
 bhaajapa sarkaar kii bahu prachaarit yah yatra 15 may 2017 ko amarkanta main khatm hui
 During the visit, the government had claimed that the government has planted 6 crore saplings along the Narmada shore
 sarkaar ke is daawey par na keval congress ne etraj jataayaa tha balki tamaam santon ne bhi ise jhootha qaraar dete hue andolan kii chetavanee di thi
 After which the government assigned ministers to the five saints who opposed
 paudharopan maamle main bhaajapa katghare main khadey karne vaale computer baba abhi bhi daawa kar rahe hai ki narmada kinare paudhe lagane main ghotaalaa hua he
 Now after this reply of the government, he will talk to Chief Minister Kamal Nath
 computer baba ne kaha ki 'is maamle ko lekar jab maine shivaraj sarkaar main rajyamantri kii kursi ko laat maar di thi to phir ab kyon is mudde ko mukaam tak nahin pahunchaaungaa
 The cleaning of the forest minister, however, after the displeasure of former Chief Minister Digvijay Singh, the forest minister of the government appeared to be reversing the reply given in the assembly
 vanmantri singhar ne chautarafa hamale ke baad kaha ki unhone kisi ko clinit nahin di balki ghotaale kii jaanch ke aadesh die hai
 The Forest Minister said that he has clearly written in the reply given in the Assembly that the inquiry has been ordered in this case, in such a situation why no attention was paid to it
 sarkaar se mili jawaab ke baad ab bhaajapa kaa maananaa he ki chaahe mandsaur golicond kaa maamla ho yaa paudharopan kaa donon maamalon main congress ne vot hasil karne ke liye janata se jhooth bolaa tha
 However, Chief Minister Kamal Nath himself had to take charge after seeing the government's disgrace in the Mandsaur firing and plantation case
 kamalnath ne twit kiya, in donon maamalon main ghotaale hue hai or ham aropiyon ko sajaa dilaayenge
 The Congress took on the BJP during the entire election on these two cases of Mandsaur firing and tree planting on the banks of Narmada
 vachan patr main maamalon kii jaanch kaa vaada bhi kiya tha lekin vidhansabha main die jawaab ke baad se sawaal khadey ho rahe hai ki kya sarkaar aate hi congress kaa rukh badal gaya he? It is right to blame Doctor Talwar and his wife Nupur Talwar in the Aarushi Talwar murder case, most readers believe this to date
 hamane apane pathakon se poocha tha ki dow
 Rajesh and Nupur Talwar killed their daughter Aarushi and servant Hemraj

 hamaare pathak es kumaar ne likhaa he ki talwaar danpati beti or naukar kii maut ke jimmedaar hai lekin unka koi kasoor nahin he kyonki aise halaat main koi bhi apni beti ko kisi ke saath dekh letaa to aisa hi karata

 The Speaker congratulated Kurien on his election to the post of Deputy Chairman and expressed confidence that his over two decades of parliamentary experience would help him run the House smoothly
 unhone kaha ki courian ne saansad or kendriya rajya mantri ke taur par kaaphi yogadan diya he
 Ansari hoped that Kurien would take all sections of the House together

 unhone kaha ki in dinon kisi bhi pad ke liye sarvasammati ban paanaa durlabh baat ho gayi he
 Jaitley said he was elected to the Lok Sabha six times while this is his third term in the Rajya Sabha
 unhone kaha ki courian ne upasabhapati ke panel main hone ke dauraan vipaksh ke sadasyon ke saath puraa nyaay kiya
 Now that his seat has turned to the opposition itself, we sincerely hope that he will give more opportunity to the opposition
 basapa pramukh mayawati ne ummid jataayi ki courian daliton or vanchit varg ke logon se jude muddon ko uthaane ke liye paryaapt samay denge
 He also suggested that while conducting the proceedings of the House, everyone including small parties should be taken care of

 He hoped that Kurien would take care of all parties including the ruling party and the opposition

 He even suggested that the bell should be removed from the pedestal
 makapa netaa ke is suzav par courian sahit saare sadasyon ke bich hansi kii lahar daud gayi
 Shivanand Tiwari of JDU endorsed Yechury's bell suggestion that Kurien has earned respect and honor due to his good behavior
 unhone bhi courian ke sarvasammati se chune jane ko durlabh avasar bataaya
 Derek o'brien of the Trinamool Congress wished him a better future, health and happiness, while Mohan Singh of the SP hoped that Kurien would maintain a balance between the members of the ruling party and the opposition

 He hoped that Kurien would take the entire house along
 unhone kaha ki courian ne prakhand str se apane raajnneetik safar kii shuruyaat kii or aaj yahaan tak pahunche
 He said Kurien had three decades of parliamentary experience and also had experience of the cooperative movement

 Kurien unanimously thanked all the members for the election and expressed confidence that he would try to run the house smoothly with the cooperation of all the members
 unhone kaha ki vah bhi ghanti kaa prayog karne ke paksh main nahin hai lekin samay kii seemaa ke kaaran aisa karnaa padataa he
 He hoped that his attachment to the bell as a teacher is natural
 haalanki unhone kaha ki vah sabhi sadasyon ko vichaar vyakt karne kaa mauka dene kaa prayaas karenge

 The meeting of Anna Hazare and his predecessor on Wednesday over the next form of agitation against corruption failed and Hazare made a formal announcement of the team's breakup
 baithak ke baad hajaare ne kaha, ‘yah durbhagyapurna he ki team alag ho gai he
 i will not join any party or group
 main unke prachaar abhiyaan main shaamil nahin hounga
 i have denied them the use of my photo and name
 aap khud se ladiye
 "significantly, Hazare and his predecessor team had last year accused the current government of trying to sabotage them by spending crores of rupees but led by Anna in a meeting on the next form of the fight against corruption"
 Team Anna's movement was shattered
 anna ke netritv main jantar mantar par bhrashtachar ke viruddh pehla anshan 2011 main april maheene main hua tha
 Attacking Kejriwal, Hazare said that if the overwhelming support of the public was in favor of the formation of a political party, then why call a meeting on Wednesday
 band kamare main nau ghante se zyada chali baithak ke baad hajaare ne kaha ki kejariwal or unke raste alag ho gaye hai
 He wished Kejriwal a new party
 unhone kaha, ‘kuch logon ko lagata he ki party banane se bhrashtachar ke khilaaf ladaai ladi ja sakati he lekin main pehle se kahata rahaa hum ki chunaav nahin laduunga or unhen meri shubhakamanaayen rahengi
 Hazare also dismissed the opinion poll conducted by India Against Corruption and said, "I do not trust Facebook, the survey conducted through internet
" ’haalanki unhone kaha, ‘raajnneetik party kaa gathan karnaa dosha nahin he or naa hi chunaav ladane waalon kaa virodh he
 If they feel that they will get a majority in Parliament then it is a good thing
 hamaare raste alag ho gaye hai
 We both have chosen our own path
 ’jab unhen is baat kii ore ishaara dilaayaa gaya ki kejariwal ne purv main ghoshnaa kii thi ki hajaare ke manjuuri die jane tak vah party kaa gathan nahin karenge, unhone kaha ki agar aisi baat he to party kaa gathan nahin kiya janaa chahie
 The meeting on Wednesday was attended by some journalists and others including Justice Santosh Hegde, Shanti Bhushan, Prashant Bhushan, Kiran Bedi, in which a group alleged that Hazare was 'exploited' by the Kejriwal group
 iske jawaab main anya samooh ne kaha ki dilli ke logon ne anna kii chhavi ko ubhaara
 On Wednesday's events, Kejriwal tweeted, 'the country is selling
 vah bahut mushkil daur se guzar rahaa he
 i will do whatever is possible to save my country
 ’ raajnneetik party ke gathan kii virdohi kiran bedi ne twit kiya, ‘anna ne aakhirkaar khud ko raajnneetik vikalp se dur kar liya
 Step to strengthen the movement

 Naik has challenged the decision of the Jhansi court in his petition, saying that the court had issued summons to him under Section 121 of the Indian Penal Code

 varrier) on Feb 14, 2018 at 8:00 am PST lambey intjaar ke baad aakhirkaar madhya pradesh kii navnirvaachit kamalnath sarkaar ke mantrimandal kaa gathan ho hi gaya
 In the newly formed cabinet, there has been an attempt to strike a balance based on regional, ethnic and factional representation
 kamalnath cabinet kii jo tasviir ubharkar saamne ai he usamen shapath lene vaale kul 28 mantriyon main malwa-nimad kshetra kaa dabadabaa saaf dekha ja saktaa he
 This is also because the Congress party has been able to return to the power of the state by demolishing this area, which is the stronghold of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)
 cabinet main malwa-nimad kaa dabadabaamukhyamantri kamalnath ne apni cabinet main madhya pradesh ke sabhi kshetron ko pratinidhitiv ke aadhaar par jagah di he
 But maximum 9 ministers have been made from malwa-neemad region
 saal 2013 ke vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi ne is kshetra kii 66 siton main se 57 siton par kabja jamaaya tha
 But BJP could save only 28 seats in this assembly election
 congress isi kshetra main mili badhat se bahumat ke kareeb aa pai
 Therefore, this stronghold of BJP has been given a lot of importance in view of the upcoming Lok Sabha elections
 malwa nimad se banane vaale mantriyon main vijay lakshmi saadho, sajjan singh verma, hukum singh karaada, bala bachchan, sachin yadav, surendra singh baghel, tulsi ram silavat, umang singhar or jitu patawaari shaamil hai
 After malwa-nimar, maximum 6 ministers have been created from the central region
 to vahiin gwalior-chambal kshetra se 5 mantri banaae gaye hai
 While 4 ministers have been made from Mahakaushal region and 3 ministers from Bundelkhand
 is baar vindhyas kshetra main congress kaa pradarshan acha nahin rahaa or vidhansabha main vipaksh ke netaa va purv mukhyamantri arjuna singh ke bete ajay singh khud chunaav haar gaye
 Hence only 1 minister from Vindhya region has got a place in the cabinet
 rajputon ko sabase zyada tarjihamadhya pradesh kii cabinet main jaateey sameekaran kii baat karen to rajputon ko khaas tarjeeh di gai he
 Maximum 8 ministers have been made from Rajput caste
 vahiin anusuchit jati se 5, anya pichhadaa varg se 5, anusuchit janajati se 4, 3 yadav, 1 muslim or 2 mahila vidhayakon ko mantri banaaya gaya he

 mahila mantriyon kii baat karen to vijayalakshmi saadho maheshwar se chun kar ain hai or purv main rajyasabha sadasya or mantri bhi rah chuki hai
 Sadho is the big female face of Congress in Nimar region
 vahiin, duusari mahila mantri imarti devi saansad jyotiraditya sindhiya kii kattar samarthak maani jaati hai or gwalior-chambal sambhag kaa lokapriy essi cheharaa hai
 Kamal nath-scindia-digvijay faction, while campaigning in the Madhya Pradesh assembly elections were often questioned that the Congress is divided into three factions in the states
 lihaaja jab congress party kii sarkaar bani to yah mana ja rahaa tha ki sabhi guton ko santusht karne main party ko mushkilon kaa samaanaa karnaa pad saktaa he
 But from the cabinet point of view, it was taken care that all the groups should get equal representation
 shaayad yahi vajah rahi ki mantriyon kii list final karne main itnaa samay laga
 Talking of the newly formed cabinet of the state, 9 ministers of former Chief Minister Digvijay Singh faction, 9 of Kamal Nath faction and 8 mlas of Jyotiraditya Scindia faction have been made ministers in this cabinet

 It is expected that with this policy to be notified this year, India will become self-sufficient in defense hardware by 2025

 He cited for example the production of mobile phones in which four years ago, where our country was completely import-dependent, today has become self-sufficient
 isaki vajah bataate hue unhone kaha, "2014 main hamaara mobile phone utpaadan kaarobaar 19,000 karod rupye tha jo aaj badhkar 90,000 karod rupye ho gaya he

 Unlike consumer goods, where goods are made in bulk and put in warehouses, the manufacture of defense hardware starts only after the signing of the contract
 duniyabar main kisi bhi hathiyaar pranali ko hasil karne main teen se paanch saal lag jaataa he, jabaki bharat main kisi hathiyaar ko sena main shaamil karne main 6 se 10 saal lag jate hai
 The agreement with the South Korean company Hanwha-tekwin for the K-9 Vajra became a matter of discussion in the Ministry of Defense when the procurement process was completed in 6 years
 ab to hastakshar hone kii sambhaavna par bhi andeh jahir kiya ja rahaa he
 Lashing out at the government for low budgetary provision, the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Defense said on March 13 that the defense budget had Rs 21,388 crore

 winta ne ek lambii-chaudee fasebuk post ke jariye puure maamle ko khulkar public main saamne rakhaa he
 Without naming Alok Nath, Vinta wrote, 'he abused me physically while i was working for the famous 1994 show' Tara '
 main un dinon tivi ke number van sho 'tara' ko likh rahi thi or iskaa production kar rahi thi
 He was behind my lead girl
 ladki kii unamem koi dilchaspee nahin thi
 "vinta also referred to the incident that happened with the show's lead actressnavanithanishan during that show
 jahaan ek seen ke dauraan alok pehle to set par sharaab pikar aae or uske baad shot ke dauraan navaneet par gir pade, jiske baad navaneet ne unhen thappad maaraa
 Alok Nath's explanation: When the 'aajtak' team had a special conversation with Alok Nath on this whole matter, they said that in today's time if a woman accuses a man, then the man has nothing to say on this

 a statement by young Dalit leader Jignesh Mevani, who won the Gujarat Assembly elections and won an independent MLA, should be a matter of discussion in the political circles
 darasal, aaj tak par anjana om kashyap se jignesh ne kaha, 'modi ji ko himalay par chale janaa chahie or vahaan jaakar haddiyaan galaana chahie
 Now people have faith in Hardik, Alpesh, Kanhaiya Kumar, not Modi
 ' isse pehle atal bihari vaajapeyi ne apni ek charchit kavita main haddiyaan galane ke prasang or dadhichi kaa zikr kiya he
 The way Jignesh gave an example, such a topic of new Dadhichi or Haddiyangalane in politics is not visible recently
 jignesh se pehle purv pradhanmantri or varisht bijepi netaa atal bihari vaajapeyi kii ek charchit kavita main 'navnirmaan' ke liye dadhichi kii haddiyon ko galane kaa prasang he
 In the poem Atal ji has used Dadhichi while commenting on the current social-politics of his era
 ye kavita atalji kii kitaab 'meri ikyavan kavitaaon' main bhi sankalit he
 He wrote - 'aahuti, rest of the sacrifices, the obstacles of the unfinished ones, to make the glory of the last Jai - the new Dadhichi bones burn; let us burn again'
 Is Jignesh's new Dadhichi Narendra Modi? Narendra Modi who discovered 'nav Dadhichi' in poetry? Actually, Jignesh said in the conversation, 'he (modi) should become Dadhichi for new people
 jignesh ne kaha, 'piem modi ab boode ho gaye hai, vah puraane boring bhaashan logon ko suna rahe hai
 They should take a break now and retire
 'or muhaavarey main kya he matlab
 
 
 'haddiyan Galana' is also a popular idiom in Hindi
 muhaavarey main iskaa matlab kisi kaam main puri tarah khap janaa he
 What is the reference to Dadhichi in the Puranas? The context of melting bones is in the Hindu Puranas
 iske mutabiq 'vritrasur' naam ke daanav se rishi, manushya or devtaa trast the
 Vajra was built by beating the bones of Dadhichi for his destruction
 indra ne isi vajra se vritrasur kaa sanhaar kiya tha
 Here, you can read the entire poem of Atal ji, 'come again lit lamps' - Come again, burn the lamps from the shadow of darkness in the darkness, squeeze the necks of the innermost - light the extinguished wick
 aao phir se diya jalaayenham padaav ko samajhe manzillakshya hua ankhon se ojhalavatarmaan ke mohjaal main-aane vaala kal na bhulaaenao phir se diya jalaaen
 Ahuti the rest of the sacrifices, the obstacles of the unfinished ones, to make the glory of the last Jai - burn the new Dadhichi bones

 At the same time, ABVP is also against this decision of the administration, adding the voice of JNUSU
 ABVP ke chaatr wing ne atendence ko lekar JNU prashasan ke faisle ko tughluqi farmaan qaraar Dhoni scored 54 runs in the match against the West Indies
 unke vanade kariyar main ye 149waan mauka rahaa jab ve 25 se zyada ranon kii pari kheli
 Dhoni's strike rate has gone below 50 after scoring more than 25 runs for the first time
 isse pehle saal 2010 main newjiland ke khilaaf unhone 50
 He scored 38 runs in 75 balls at an average of 66
 westeindies ke khilaaf pichley match main dhoni ne shandaar batting kaa mujayara kiya tha, jiske baad unhone media ke saamne kaha tha ki ve us puraani sharaab kii tarah hai jo samay bitne ke saath zyada kargar hota jaataa he

 The political things that are being created around the elections in the three states of the Hindi belt, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, are also not meaningless
 loksabhaa chunaav se bamushkil chah maheene pehle 11 disambar ko ghoshit hone vaale parinaam se spasht ho jayega ki desh ke donon bade rashtriya dal—congress or bhaajapa kitne pani main hai
 At present, the BJP is in power in all three states and has 62 Lok Sabha seats in 65 of these states
 yadi sattarudh dal ek se adhik rajya main haar jaataa he to use loksabhaa chunaav ke liye apni ranneeti par phir se vichaar karnaa hoga
 Defeat in these states will deepen the crisis on bjp's future as the party has not even got the chance to fathom its political existence in the eastern and southern provinces of the country
 lekin isse bhi badi baat, congress kaa jeetna rahul gandhi ke liye sanjivani siddh hoga or congress ke punaruddhar kaa rasta taiyaar hone lagegaa
 If the results come to the contrary, then those two old claims will be confirmed again - it is impossible to defeat the charisma of the electoral machinery of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP President Amit Shah in the Hindi heartland and the plan of Congress revival under the leadership of Rahul Gandhi is only on paper
 i will remain confined
 isse agle chunaavon main modi ke khilaaf vipakshi dalon kaa mahagathbandhan khadaa karne main dhuree kii bhoomika nibhaane kaa congress kaa sapana bhi chakanachur ho saktaa he
 Another thing that makes these elections very interesting is that there is going to be a direct competition between the two big parties
 aakhri baar aisa muqabla disambar 2017 main modi-shah ke gruhakshetra gujarat main hua tha
 At the last moment, the competition was thorny
 haalanki congress paanch baar se lagaataar sattashin bhaajapa ke khilaaf satta virdohi lahar ko bhunaane main naakaam rahi par 182 sadasyeey vidhansabha main bhaajapa kii takat 100 se kam ho gai
 There is talk of anti-incumbency in the electoral states once again and the fate of three high-profile chief ministers of the BJP — Vasundhara Raje in Rajasthan, Shivraj Singh Chauhan in Madhya Pradesh and Raman Singh in Chhattisgarh - are to be written
 in teen mukhyamantriyon main se sabase nai vasundhara raaje ke khilaaf rajasthan main sabase prachand sattavirohi lahar dikh rahi he
 By the way, the history of Rajasthan has also been that the people there do not return the ruling party, but every time the command of the state is handed over to another party
 chhattisgarh main, raman singh 2003 se satta main hai
 In the last elections, he had won by a very small margin in the match with the Congress without the leadership, which is a matter of concern
 haalanki, yahaan ke parinaam donon hi dalon ke kendriya netritv ko bahut zyada chintit nahin karenge kyonki yah rajya loksabhaa main 11 sadsy hi bhejtaa he
 So everyone will keep an eye on Chauhan, who is in the election field for the fourth time
 rajyon se ubharkar aae bhaajapa ke sabase majboot or sabase lokapriy netaaon main se ek shivaraj singh, jo "madhya pradesh ke mamaa'' ke taur par jane jate hai, kariyar kii sabase kathin pariksha kaa saamana kar rahe hai
 He may get the benefit of the factionalism of the Congress, but many of the last-time lurid political announcements reveal the uneasiness and frustration of this senior BJP leader
 bataaya jaataa he ki modi ne bhi kai maukon par unke saath vah garmjoshi nahin dikhaai he jisaki unhen ummid thi
 Yet, like the other two Chief Ministers, Chauhan's hopes also rest on Modi's charismatic personality and election campaign that has changed the results of many elections in the past
 bhaajapa kii jeet or haar ke bich pradhanmantri khadey honge
 This is also evident from the fact that Rahul is targeting Modi and his policies in all rallies
 in rajyon ke mukhyamantri ke khilaaf vah shaayad hi kuch bolte hai
 Perhaps that is why the result of December 11 will also be a referendum on Narendra Modi's invincibility
