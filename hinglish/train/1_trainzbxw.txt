 Now the opportunity is to base the report card of the ministers responsible for these schemes, to give them significant responsibility for success or to show the way out of the cabinet for failure
 baat sarkaar kii yojanaon kii ho to jubaan par ek hi sawaal he
 After all what happened to mother Ganga
 modi sarkaar kii jor-shor se shuru kii gai yojana namaami gange kaa parinaam teen saal ke baad bhi kyon nahin dikhaai de rahaa he? ganga kii haalat jas kii tas bani hui he yaa yun kahe ki haalat sudharne kii bajaay or bigadi hi he
 The Ministry of Water Resources and Ganga Cleanup Project Uma Bharti have direct responsibility for this failure of the Ministry
 kendriya pradooshan niyantran board kii report ne ganga ke pani ko pine kya, nahaane laayak bhi nahin mana he
 Recently, the PMO asked the officials of the Ganga Ministry, what should be the reply to the public on this issue after three years
 jaahir he adhikariyon ke jawaab se pradhanmantri karyaalay bhi santusht najar nahin aayaa
 Crores of rupees once again flowed? a few months ago in his investigation, Aaj Tak found that his parliamentary constituency was the last in the Modi government's dream project 'namami Gange'
 iskaa sabase bada udhaaharan he ki sarkaar ke teen saal puure hone ke baad bhi ‘namaami gange’ ke tahat banaras main ek bhi project par kaam shuru nahin ho paaya
 So far, only a bundle of files have been kept ready for the Ganga desalination
 namaami gange yojana ke naam par prastaavit 150 karod kii laagat vaale 50 emeldi ke chote sivej treetment plant kii abhi tender prakriya hi shuru ho pai he
 Research by IIT BHU, Pollution Control Board and other agency has proved that the water of Ganga which has been away from the Ganges Ghats is not even worth taking in Anjali
 akele varanasi kii ganga main chote-bade lagbhag 40 se zyada naalon kaa pani aakar miltaa he, jo use lagaataar jaharila bana rahaa he
 Twenty-nine million liters of waste falls daily in the Ganges and so far there is no effect of the government's plan
 puja karne se bhi maili ho gai gangaek report ke mutabik har roj ganga main 20 lakh se zyada log dharmik snaan karte hai
 To clean these remains, a cleaning boat runs under the banner of Namami Gange, which cleans the water to some extent
 ganga ko nirmal banane ke prayaas bahut pehle se kiye jate rahe hai
 In this episode, Ganga was declared a national river in the year 2008
 iske baavjood ganga kaa pradooshan ghatane kii bajaae lagaataar badhata hi gaya he
 Even after the completion of the Rs 2800 crore Ganga cleaning project between 2000 and 2010, there has been no difference in the level of pollution of Ganga
 uske baad modi sarkaar ne 20 hajaar karod sirf ganga safai ke liye ghoshit kar die
 In these three years neither any special money has been spent nor there was any monitoring on the distribution of money
 or gandi ho gai gangasipisibi ne uttarakhand main gangotri se haridwar ke bich 294 kilometre lambii ganga main 11 jagahon se gangaajal ke namoonay jaanch ke liye the
 These samples were taken to test the four main patterns of Ganges water quality
 inamen dissolved oxigen (dio), biologic oxijan demand (biodi) or coliform (bacteria) kii jaanch shaamil he
 The CPCB investigation revealed that the amount of BOD, coliform and other toxic substances in Gangajal around Haridwar is quite high
 kuch aisa hi haal kaashi kaa bhi he
 According to a World Bank report, 12 percent of Uttar Pradesh's diseases are due to polluted Ganges water
 band nahin ho paa rahi pradooshan kii factory'namaami gange' ke tahat ganga kinare 48 audyogic icaayiyon ko band karne kaa aadesh diya gaya tha, lekin ab bhi inkaa kachra ganga main hi samahit ho rahaa he
 The plan to clean the Ganges water may be stuck, but the cleanliness of the ghats along the Ganges is taking place in PM Modi's area and youths, besides voluntary organizations, are actively participating in this work
 logon kii bhagidaari ke liye kuch cultural program shuru kiye gaye hai, jinamein logon ko swatchta se judane kaa sandesh diya ja rahaa he
 Why could not it be clear from the leaders, from Gangarajiv Gandhi to Narendra Modi, crores of rupees were spent, but no one could save the cleanness of the Ganges water
 bijepi ab tak rajya main sapa sarkaar par saath naa dene kaa aarope lagaati rahi, lekin ab rajya main yogi sarkaar aane ke baad us par ganga safai ke liye dabaav or badhane lage hai
 The term of the Modi government is two more years left, which seems to be very less in view of the current situation of the Ganges

 Mirza drove her away on the day of Sahiba's wedding

 thodaa aaraam karke aage badhenge

 Here Sahiba began to fear that if Mirza and his brothers were confronted
 
 
 uske liye donon hi pyaare the
 She could neither see Mirza's blood nor her brothers
 usne is sthiti se bachane ke liye mirza ke saare tir tod daale
 Sahiba thought that if there were no arrows, he would not be able to perform miracles and his brothers would also take pity on him
 lekin aisa hua nahin
 
 
 Sahiba's brothers reach there and surround Mirza
 mirza ke paas tir nahin the phir bhi wo bahaduree se lade
 But while fighting dozens of people got tired and badly injured
 jiske baad unki mrityu ho gai
 What happened to Sahiban? 
 The This question often arises
 kuch logon kaa maananaa he ki mirza ne ant main sahiba ko maaf kar diya tha or usase vaada liya tha ki wo jinda rahegi
 At the same time, some people also believe that Sahiban killed himself with a sword as soon as Mirza died

 But Mirza and Sahiban's story is an immortal example of true love

 narendra modi sarkaar ne yogi adityanath sarkaar ke us faisle ko gaiyr-kanoonee qaraar diya he, jiske tahat 17 pichhadi jatiyon ko anusuchit jati main shaamil karne kaa aadesh diya he
 In the Rajya Sabha, Union Minister Thawar Chand Gehlot said that he has demanded the withdrawal of this decision from the UP government as it is not legally appropriate
 kendriya mantri thavar chand gahalot ne kaha ki yah puri tarah se asanvaidhanik he kyonki yah sansad kaa visheshadhikaar he or yah kisi bhi vidhi nyaayalay main maanya nahin he
 We will request the Yogi government to withdraw this decision
 darasal basapa saansad satish chandra mishra ne mangalvaar ko rajyasabha ke shoonyakaal main upi kii 17 jatiyon ko sanvaidhanik prakriya ke tahat anusuchit jati kii list main daalane kaa mudda uthaate hue kaha ki upi sarkaar ne teen din pehle in 17 jatiyon ko obisi kii list se baahar kar diya or anusuchit jati kaa certificate dene ke liye kaha gaya he jo ki puri tarah se gaiyr sanvaidhanik he
 Mishra said that this is a fraud with these 17 castes as these castes also removed from the obcs and changes in the constitution cannot be made in the Scheduled Scope
 basapa saansad ne maang kii samvidhan ke tahat in jatiyon ko anusuchit jatiyon kaa darja diya jaae or upi sarkaar ko centre aadesh waapas lene ke liye adwijuri jari kare
 Replying to the question of Satish Chandra Mishra, Union Minister Thawarchand Gehlot said that it is the job of Parliament to put a caste in the class of another caste
 agar upi sarkaar ne in jatiyon ko obisi se essi main laana chaahati he to uske liye prakriya he or rajya sarkaar aisa koi prastaav bhejegi to ham us par vichaar karenge
 But the order that has just been issued is not constitutional, because if someone goes to court then that order will be repealed
 bataa den ki uttar pradesh kii yogi sarkaar ne 17 ati pichhadi jatiyon ko anusuchit jati main shaamil karne kaa aadesh jari kiya tha
 Among these 17 castes are Kahar, Kashyap, Kewat, Mallah, Nishad, Kumhar, Prajapati, Dhivar, Bind, Bhar, Rajbhar, Dhimar, Watham, Turaha, Godiya, Manjhi and Fisherman

 Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose, along with Madan Mohan Malaviya and Atal Bihari Vajpayee, could also receive the Bharat Ratna
 centre sarkaar is sambandh main icchhuk thi, lekin netaji ke parivaar kii ek aapatti ke chalate yah sambhav nahin ho sakaa
 What is the secret of Netaji's death? The English newspaper 'the Times of India' has quoted sources claiming that the demand for giving Bharat Ratna to Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose had reached the Modi government and the Center also liked the idea
 Was
 lekin, yah prastaav rakhane waalon ne bataaya ki subhash kii maut se judi gutthi kii vajah se unhen yah sammaan nahin diya ja sakaa

 In the midst of all-out attacks on the gang rape and murder case in Badaun, Samajwadi Party (SP) leaders targeted the media and lashed out at strange arguments, stating that sometimes when relations between girls and boys are exposed, it 'rape is named'
 sapa supremeo mulaayam singh yadav ne badaayun main do ladakiyon ke saath samuhik balaatkaar or hatya ke maamle par media main ho rahi kawarej ko lekar apni nakhushi chhipaai nahin or patrakaron se kaha, aap apana kaam kiijie or hamen apana kaam karne dijie

 ramgopal yadav ne media par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki is tarah ke maamle rajasthan, madhya pradesh or maharashtra main bhi ho rahe hai, lekin unako nahin dikhaaya ja rahaa he
 At the same time, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, facing heavy criticism about the incident of Badaun, said that a Google search will show that such incidents are happening all over the country
 unhone media par aarope lagaaya ki vah unke rajya main ho rahi ghatnaon ko lekar khel rahaa he

 Congress President Rahul Gandhi has strongly attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 rahul gandhi ne piem modi ko naakaabil insaan qaraar diya he or kaha he ki ve kisi kii nahin sunate
 The Congress president tweeted on a news report, "congress has created India's growth story, Modi has used demonetisation and Gabbar Singh tax to completely demolish it
" ve ek naakaabil insaan hai jo kisi kii nahin sunate hai
 "the news that Rahul Gandhi shared with his tweet claimed that demonetisation and GST during the Lok Sabha elections can come as a big failure of the government
 congress adhyaksh ne is khabar par apni pratikriya di he
 Congress built the India growth story
 Modi has used Demonetisation and the Gabbar Singh Tax to completely destroy it
 He's an incompetent man who listens to nobody

 shanivaar ko hicongress adhyakshane sarkaar par hamalaa bolte hue kaha tha ki desh main ek saal main 1 karod naukariyaan khatm ho gai hai or piem modi anil ambani se chori karavaate rahe
 Rahul Gandhi posted a Business Today news and wrote, "breaking! One crore 10 lakh jobs ended in the year 2018
 har saal 2 karod yuvaaon ko rojgaar kaa vaada karne vaale pradhanmantri aaj bhi 'raag jumala' alaap rahe hai
 If Modi had worked for the country instead of stealing Anil Ambani, the youth's future would not have been so unsafe
 " is khabar main centre for monitering indian iconomi kii ek report ke hawaale se bataaya gaya he ki saal 2018 main kareeb ek karod 10 lakh logon ne apni naukari ganvaa di
 Here, Prime Minister Narendra Modi also launched a political arrow on the Congress President on Saturday
 odisha main ek jansabha ko sambodhit karte hue piem modi ne kaha ki congress leadership kii pole khul rahi he isliye ve aahat hai
 He said that the middleman, arrested in the Rs 3,600 crore agustawestland VVIP helicopter case, has links between the British businessman and him (rahul, Sonia)
 piem ne kaha ki "desh ke chaukeedaar ko hataane ke liye 'choron kaa samaaj' ek jute ho rahaa he, kyonki vah unka bhandaphod karke unako pakadaney vaala he" Inflation witch is not only benefiting the common people, but also the profits of stock investors

 Despite the success of the American campaign, advisors to Prime Minister Narendra Modi had realized that India has become somewhat isolated in global diplomacy of trade, full of all the tricks
 china or america kii javaabi peshbandi jis nae global dhruvikaran kii shuruyaat kar rahi he, do vishaal vyapaar sandhiyaan uski dhuree hongi
 The us-led Trans Pacific Network (TPP) and China's backed Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) could neutralize the World Trade Organization (WTO) in the next few years
 in donon sandhiyon main bharat kaa koi dakhal nahin he or rahaa dablutio to vahaan bhi ek bada samajhaita roak kar bharat haashie par simatata ja rahaa tha
 This was the reason why India's diplomatic squad not only ended the deadlock in the WTO by settling a dispute with the US before the Prime Minister reached Brisbane for the G20 but also indicated to the world that India had chosen its partner in international diplomacy
 pradhanmantri narendra modi kii kootnithik variyatayen spasht hone lagi hai
 In diplomatic circles, there was a lot of confusion about why the Prime Minister did not go to Beijing for the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit, despite China's invitation? The 21-member Apec, with a presence in all major economies of the Asia Pacific region and the US, Russia, Canada, Japan, jointly boasts 53 percent of the world's GDP, 44 percent of global trade and 40 percent of the population
 bharat is taqatvar sanghathan main shaamil hone kii koshish karata rahaa he
 There was a ban on the induction of new members between 1998 and 2010, so there was no opportunity for membership
 july main bharat yatra ke dauraan china ke raashtrapati shi jininpag ne jab pradhanmantri ko apek main aane kaa nyotaa diya to ise paroksh rup se apek kii sadsyta kaa nyotaa hi mana gaya
 But the Prime Minister's refusal was probably part of the diplomatic design in which American colors are now visible
 america raashtrapati baraak obama ne beijing kii apek baithak ke liye apni yatra kii shuruyaat trans pacific partnership kaa zikr karte hue kii thi
 The us-led TPP is a response to China's global ambitions
 china is sandhi se baahar he or asia prashanth kshetra main ek mukt vyapaar sandhi ke liye apek sadasyon ko raji karne kii koshish kar rahaa he
 Obama arrived in Beijing with an agenda to limit Apec's activism
 apek ke kuch sadsy america netritv vaali transpacific sandhi kaa hissaa bhi hai or america tipipi vaartaayen puri hone tak apek ko rokane ke haq main he, isliye apek main aupchaarik sandhi par sahmati nahin ban pai, yani ki bajing kii jutan se china ke mafik nattejey nahin nikle
 The us-led trans-pacific Partnership connects the 21 major economies of Asia Pacific and South America (not including India), covering 40 percent of the world's GDP and 26 percent of trade
 doha daur kii vaartaon ko chhodkar dablutio ek safal global vyapaar dhaancha banane main kamobesh asafal rahaa he isliye america ne 2009 main tipipi kii neenv rakhi thi
 India has not been included in the TPP talks yet, but it seems to be opening up in the light of fresh relations with the US
 dakshin or purv asia is samay global kootneeti kii dhuree he, jahaan pratispardhi vyapaar sandhiyaan aakaar le rahi hai
 Interestingly, India is part of a third treaty here, the RCEP (regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership)
 asian deshon ke bich mukt vyapaar kaa network banane ke liye 2012 main isaki shuruyaat hui thi
 This treaty included China, not the US
 bharat ne asian main china ke kareeb jate hue is sandhi kaa hissaa bananaa sweekaar kiya tha
 In fact, Prime Minister Modi arrived in Myanmar's East Asia Summit to strengthen this treaty, but the message that came out from there was not a new warmth between India and America but between India and America, which is starting with the consent of the WTO
 modi ke america se lautate hi raashtrapati baraak obama ne kelogs bijness skool main elaan kiya tha ki bharat or china nahin balki america duniya ke liye nivesh kaa sabase upyukt thikaana he
 For the first time in recent years, an American President has so vocally presented America to the world, compared to China and India
 beijing se iskaa jawaab beete saptaah aayaa jab raashtrapati shi chinafing ne asia prashanth aarthik sahyog shikhar baithak main kaha ki avasaron or ummiido se bharaa china vishwa ke netritv ko taiyaar he
 The struggle for economic power has started between China and America
 bharat ne hakeekat ko samajhte hue is pratispardhaa main apni jagah lenaa shuru kar diya he
 New relations between India and the US were to begin in Washington when Prime Minister Narendra Modi was there, but a new phase of relations has actually started from the new capital of Myanmar
 obama ne pai ta ke dinar main modi ko kar dikhaane vaala netaa yun hi nahin kaha
 Modi has done it
 bharat kii kootneeti nai karavat le rahi he
 After the G20 meeting, if the friendship between India and America is worth seeing, then the thrill of india-china relationship will not leave any stone unturned

 a spokesman of the separatist camp said that this decision has been taken so that the Hindu community can celebrate the festival of Shivaratri without any hindrance

 It is also locally known as Hereth

 Earlier, many people of the valley had raised the issue of Shivaratri on the day of closure
 mausam vibhaag (iemdi) kii ore se achche monsoon kii bhavishyavaanee se gramin kshetron se maang main vruddhi hone kii ummid he or bikri par bhi iskaa asar dekhne ko milegaa
 Dabur and Emami, a company making daily consumption goods (FMGC), said this
 companiyaan gramin kshetron se maang main sudhaar kii ummid kar rahi he
 The government's decision to focus on rural infrastructure and increase the minimum support price (MSP) of crops will also help accelerate rural sales
 dabar india ke mukhya vittiya adhikari lalit malik ne pitiai bhashaa se kaha, "mousan vibhaag ke anumaan ke mutabik is varsh barish saamaanya rahegi , jisase upabhoktaaon ke rukh main sudhaar aayega or doordaraj ke ilaakon se maang main vruddhi hogi
 " duusari ore, imami ko gramin kshetron se bikri main vruddhi dahaai ank main rahane kii ummid he
 Madan Pandey, president (sales) of the company said, “emami has set a target of increasing sales from rural areas to double digits due to the general monsoon

 (bhashaa se input) Dabur India Chief Financial Officer Lalit Malik told PTI, "according to the forecast of the Department of Mauson, the rainfall will be normal this year, which will improve the attitude of consumers and increase the demand from remote areas
 " On the other hand, Emami expects sales in rural areas to be in double digits
 company ke adhyaksh ( bikri ) madan pandey ne kaha, "saamaanya monsoom ke chalate imami ne gramin kshetron se bikri main vruddhi dahaai ank main rahane kaa lakshya rakhaa he

 (bhashaa se input) He said that the rural economy is least affected by short-term economic constraints such as GDP
 (bhashaa se input) What did the central government decide about demonetisation that the whole country is stuck in currency crisis
 deshbhar main atm khaali pade hai to bainkon or post offison ke baahar lambii-lambii kataren hai
 It has even come to the fore that now government and private petrol pumps are being resorted across the country, so that the general public can be brought out of the currency crisis
 sarkaar main afra-tafari kaa alam ye he ki subah rigerv bank or vitt mantralay bank se paisa vitaran ke liye ungali main syaahi lagane kaa aadesh dete hai to agle din kii subah is faisle ko waapas le lete hai
 If the price of withdrawals from atms and banks is ever increased, then the price is again reduced in the next 24 hours
 kul milakar ek baat saaf he ki centre sarkaar ne notebandi ke is faisle ko jari karne main jaldbaaji dikhaa di or ab puraa maamla uske liye bada sir dard ban chukaa he
 After all, why did the government have to wait for the right time to take this decision? 1
 rigerv bankke aankadon ke mutabik, desh main 2
 There are 6 crore credit cards and 70 crore debit cards
 bank ke mutabik, desh main cashles bankig ke ye instrument simat jansankhya ke paas hi uplabdh he
 Meaning a person has more than two-three cards
 jisase desh kii 125 karod kii jansankhya main badi taadaad aisi he, jo in tareekon se bankig kaa phayda nahin uthaa sakati
 2
 desh main bhugtan karne ke teen tareeke hai
 First, you can pay through online banking
 doosraa, aap kisi atm se paise nikaalkar bhugtan kar sakate hai
 And thirdly, you can pay through your debit or credit card with the help of swipe machine at places like shop, petrol pump
 lekin rigerv bank ke aankade bataate hai ki in sabhi madhyam se bhugtan karne ke liye jaruri technology puure desh main uplabdh nahin he
 atmdensity in the country is very poor
 gramin ilaakon se atm saikadon kilometre kii duuri par he
 Banking's condition is worse than that
 vahiin swip mashin abhi bhi shaharon kii simit dukaanon main paaya jaataa he
 In such a situation, the entire country was dependent on cash transactions only when this decision was taken
 3
 The countrywide program for Digital India was launched by the central government in 2015
 is kaarykram ke jariye desh main digital literysi ko 100 fisadi tak badhaane kii kavayad ho rahi he
 At present, except the villages of the country, the work of connecting all the cities to the Internet has not been completed
 sarkaar ke vijan document ke mutabik, puure desh main internet kii suvidha muhaiyaa karaane main abhi 5 saal kaa vakt he
 At the same time, people are facing the task of reaching villages through mobile penetration
 smartphone desh main nayaa he or ise sabhi tak pahunchane ke kaam main mobile companiyon ke bhi paanch saal kaa samay lagegaa
 In such a situation, the government needed to think that first of all, it should reach the villages in the country and make digital literate of maximum population of the country
 notebandika yah aadesh agar in baton kaa dhyaan rakh kar diya jaataa or ise paarit karne ke liye pehle desh ko taiyaar kar diya gaya hota to aam aadmi ko aaj itani dikkaton kaa saamana nahin karnaa padataa
 Now even if this exercise of the government is in the interest of the country, to curb black money in one stroke, time would have been taken care of in passing it so the common man would not have to stand in the queue today

 Chairman of the board AB Aggarwal told reporters, the water level in our reservoirs (bhakra and Beas) is continuously increasing this season
 (bhakhda main) jalastr pichley 40-50 saalon main sarvaadhik he
 He said, We had a meeting with him on July 5 to apprise Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal about the situation in Bhakra
 agarwal ne kaha ki baari maatra main barf ke pighalane evam monsoon purv barish ke chalate jalastr badhata ja rahaa he or agle kuch dinon main atirikt pani chode jane kii jarurat he
 "I want to assure the people that we will release water in a controlled manner so that there will not be floods, but it is being said that if there is a situation like Uttarakhand, then BBMB or any other organization of the world will be helpless
" agarwal ne kaha ki bhakhda main jalastr agle 7-8 dinon main 1645 foot ke str ko paar kar jayega
 When asked how much water would be released, he said that it would depend on how the water flow at that time
 unhone kaha, is saal baari barish evam barf ke adhiktam pighalane ke kaaran lagata he ki pani kaa str kaaphi pehle hi nirdhaarit str tak pahunch jayega
 There is every possibility of release of water, as the entire monsoon season has just passed
 bhakhda or pong baandh is saal sitambar tak kramash: 1680 or 1390 feet tak bhare jane hai
 He said that the probability of flooding in Bhakra Dam has increased manifold in the last several years
 iske liye sutluj or beas nadiyon ke aasapaas avaidh nirmaan ko jimmedaar tehraate hue kaha, beas or sutluj (punjab ke) jin jilon se guzarati hai, yadi aap vahaan jaaen to aap atikaraman paaenge

 Badal yesterday directed the Deputy Commissioners of Ropar, Nawanshahar, Ferozepur, Jalandhar, Hoshiarpur, Moga and Kaputharla to make adequate arrangements to deal with any unforeseen situation
 tippaniyan In view of the warning, Punjab Irrigation Minister Janmeja Singh Sekhon has directed all the Chief Engineers to deploy officers at all sensitive places along the rivers and canals
 bhakhda beas prabandhan board kii ore se sutluj or beas ke dub kshetra main avaidh nirmaan ko nadiyon ke mukt bahaav main baadha ke liye jimmedaar bataae jane par sekhon ne kaha, vah avaidh kabja bilkul nahin he

 The minister said that the Punjab government has already set up a state-level flood control room and will continue to work round the clock during the emergency
 board ke adhyaksh abi agarwal ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha, is sijan main hamaare jalaashyon (bhakhda or beas) main jalastr lagaataar bad rahaa he
 (in Bhakra) Water level is highest in last 40-50 years
 unhone kaha, hamane bhakhda kii sthiti se punjab ke mukhyamantri prakaash singh badal ko avgat karaane ke liye 5 july ko unke saath baithak kii thi
 Aggarwal said that due to heavy snow melt and pre-monsoon rains, the water level is increasing and additional water needs to be released in the next few days
 unhone kaha, main logon ko aashwaasan dena chahta hum ki ham niyantrit tareeke se pani chodenge taaki baadh nahin aae, lekin chetavanee ke taur par kaha ja rahaa he ki yadi uttarakhand jaisi sthiti hogi to bibiembi yaa duniya kaa koi bhi anya sanghathan asahaay hoga
 Aggarwal said that the water level in Bhakra will cross the 1645 feet level in the next 7-8 days
 jab unase poocha gaya ki kitna pani choda jayega to unhone kaha ki yah is baat par nirbhar karegaa ki us vakt pani kaa bahaav kaisaa he
 He said, due to heavy rains and maximum melting of snow this year, it seems that the water level will reach the set level well in advance
 pani chode jane kii puri sambhaavna he, kyonki abhi puraa monsoon sijan padaa he
 Bhakra and Pong dams are to be filled up to 1680 and 1390 feet respectively by September this year
 unhone kaha ki pichley kai varshon main bhakhda baandh main baadh kii sambhaavna kai guna bad gai he
 Blaming the illegal construction around the Sutlej and Beas rivers for this, he said, if you go through the districts of Beas and Sutlej (of Punjab), you will find encroachment
 aapako koi aisa sthaan nahin milegaa jahaan atikaraman nahin hua he
 He put the responsibility of stopping the encroachment on the Punjab government
 badal ne kal ropar, navanshahar, ferozepur, jalandhar, hoshiyarpur, moga or kapoothrala ke upayuktaon ko kisi bhi aakasmik sthiti se nibatane ke liye paryaapt intjaam karne kaa nirdesh diya tha
 The comments chetavanee ke maddenjar punjab ke sinchai mantri janameja singh sekhon ne sabhi mukhya abhiyantaaon ko nirdesh diya he ki ve nadiyon or naharon ke tatavarti ilaakon main sabhi samvedansheel sthanon par adhikariyon ko tainaat karen
 Asked by the Bhakra Beas Management Board that illegal construction in the submergence area of sutlej and Beas was responsible for obstructing the free flow of rivers, Sekhon said, "that is not illegal occupation at all
" 
 People own their own land in the river stream and the surrounding area and have built shelter for livestock etc
 However after warning we have asked them to remove their cattle and protect their goods
 mantri ne kaha ki punjab sarkaar pehle hi rajya str ke baadh niyantran kaksh kaa gathan kiya he or vah apatkaal ke dauraan choubison ghante kaam karata rahegaa
 "I want to assure the people that we will release water in a controlled manner so that there will not be floods, but it is being said that if there is a situation like Uttarakhand, then BBMB or any other organization of the world will be helpless

 Rahul Gandhi has returned from a leave of nearly two months
 kahaan gaye kya kiya ye sawaal poochne par congress ke bade chote sabhi netaa kehete hai ki ye unka nijee maamla he
 It may be, but this question was asked again and again because it is a new thing for any leader in India to take leave from the party or politics
 shaayad congress ke puraane netaaon ko bhi ye brake naa samaj main aayaa or naa pachaa
 But because the Congress did not have the tradition of questioning the decisions of Gandhi family till now, an attempt was made to justify the first break
 kaha gaya ki rahul aatmachintan kar rahe hai
 But it was also gradually clear that whether the small and the biggest leaders of the Congress do not know where Rahul is and what he is doing
 jaise-jaise rahul kii chuttee se waapas aane kii tarikh aage khisakati gai, soshal media or media main 'rahul kii chuttee' mazaaq kaa vishay ban gai
 And from here, the question of Rahul's ability to take over the party and the time he was in command - from within the Congress itself
 bhale hi ham kitna bhi kah len ki ye congress main old guard varsez new guard he lekin botmaline yahi he ki sawaal uthne shuru ho gaye hai
 i will come back to the importance of these questions, but before that it is also necessary to explain why after all the media gave expensive paper space and air space to Rahul's leave and his return
 congress desh kii sabase puraani party he or sabase lambey vaqt tak satta main rahi he
 Many big names have been associated with the history of modern India
 achche bure kai daur se guzari he lekin 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main jaisi zabardast haar congress ko mili he ki das maheene ke baad bhi netaa sakate main hai or kaaryakarta niraash
 The opposition should not be so weak in Parliament that the strength of democracy begins to wane
 kshetreey partiyaan hai lekin pan neshnal party abhi tak congress hi rahi he
 The matter of giving the command of Rahul in the hands of Congress has been going on for a long time, but it is a new thing for the media to go on leave for a politician and especially when his people are expressing their trust in that leader that they will come and The party will be saved
 or to or jaise-jaise rahul ke aane kii tarikh aage khisakati gai, beemaari se jujh rahi sonia gandhi ek baar phir kaman jor shor se sambhalati nazar ain
 The Land Acquisition Bill is an issue on which the Congress may well surround the government but Rahul remains absent
 raajnneeti main jo mauqe kaa faaydaa naa uthaae wo netaa kaisaa or kabhi on kabhi of netaa apane samarthakon main bharosa to nahin jagaa saktaa
 The comments rahul ne aise vaqt par chuttee par jaakar sawaal uthaane kaa mauqaa khud diya he
 And the chance has not only increased the expectations that he is going to do some miracle on his return and by now his injured Congress party will be healthy in a blink of an eye
 lekin jaisaa maine pehle kaha, kisi gandhi par sawaal ahmiyat rakhata he- iskaa matlab ye bhi he ki kahin kisi str par party main badlaav aa rahaa he
 Today, if there are questions to preserve their political existence, then tomorrow the Gandhi family and their decisions can be questioned to save the party
 ek tarah se ye congress party kaa wo daur he jahaan panna palatney kii himmat or kuvat parakhte kai netaa nazar aaenge
 This can become a period of churn, not introspection in the party

 in sawaalon kii ahmiyat par main waapas aaungi lekin uske pehle ye bhi bataanaa zaruri he ki akhir media ne mahangaa paper spes or air spes rahul kii chuttee or unki vaapasi ko kyon diya
 The Congress is the oldest party in the country and has been in power for the longest time
 aadhunik bharat ke itihaas ke kai bade naam usase jude rahe hai
 The good and bad have gone through many periods, but in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the Congress has suffered such a huge defeat that even after ten months, the leaders are able and the workers are disappointed
 vipaksh sansad main itnaa kamazor nahin hona chahie ki loktantr kii majbooti khatm hone lage
 There are regional parties but the Pan National Party has so far remained Congress
 congress main kaman rahul ke haath main dene kii baat lambey samay se chal rahi he lekin media ke liye bhi kisi rajaneta kaa chuttee par janaa nai chiz hi he or khaaskar tab jab us netaa par ye vishwaas uske log jataa rahe hon ki bas wo aaenge or party kaa uddhaar ho jayega
 Moreover, as the date of Rahul's arrival slipped further, Sonia Gandhi, who was battling illness, once again appeared to be commanding herself with a loud noise
 zamin adhigrahan vidheyak ek aisa mudda he jis par congress sarkaar ko acchhee tarah se gher sakati he lekin rahul nadaarad rahe
 How can a leader who does not take advantage of the opportunities in politics and sometimes on or off-leader can not instill confidence in his supporters
 tippaniyan Rahul has given himself the opportunity to raise questions by going on leave at such a time
 or mauqaa hi nahin ummiden aisi badha di hai ki laut kar aane par bas ab wo koi chamatkaar karne vaale hai or ab tak apane zakhm sahalaati congress party palak jhapakate tandoorust ho jaaegi
 But like i said earlier, the question on some Gandhi is important - it also means that at some stage there is a change in the party
 aaj agar apane raajnneetik astitv ko bachaae rakhane ke liye sawaal ho rahe hai to kal party ko bachaae rakhane ke liye gandhi parivaar or unke faisalon par bhi sawaal ho sakate hai
 In a way, this is the era of the Congress Party where many leaders will be seen daring to turn the page and test their way
 party main ye aatmamanthan nahin manthan kaa daur ban saktaa he
 The opposition should not be so weak in Parliament that the strength of democracy begins to wane
 kshetreey partiyaan hai lekin pan neshnal party abhi tak congress hi rahi he

 Bollywood star Aamir Khan announced the Satyamev Jayate Water Cup Season 2 in Mumbai
 is kaarykram main aamir khan ke saath maharashtra ke mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis ne bhi shirkat kii
 The Government of Maharashtra and Aamir Khan's organization Pani Foundation are working together in this mission of saving water
 water cap sijan 2 kii ghoshnaa ke samay aamir khan kii patni kiran raav bhi maujuud thim jinhone pani sangrakshan kii is muhim ke liye pehali baar marathi main gaanaa gaya he
 Last year, Aamir Khan started a campaign in association with the state government's Jalyukta camp, which aimed to store and conserve water in drought-stricken villages
 kai gaanvon main isse judi pratiyogita shuru kii gai jise satyamev jayate water cap naam diya gaya
 Under this, Aamir Khan's organization Pani Foundation taught water conservation in 3 talukas of Maharashtra last year
 is abhiyaan kii safalataa ke baad is saal maharashtra ke 13 jilon ke 30 tallukon main logon ko pani jamaa karne ke tareekon ke bare main bataaya jayega taaki rajya ke log sookhe kii maar se lard saken
 Aamir Khan said on this occasion, 'I am happy that we are growing it 10 times this year, there is also fear that we will be able to complete it well? The Chief Minister of Maharashtra has supported us by joining this campaign
 mukhyamantri ne hamase kaha tha kii is abhiyaan ko jan-jan tak pahunchaana hoga or sabhi logon ko is muhim se jodna hoga tabhi ham safal honge kyonki akelaa aadmi kuch nahin kar saktaa
 i am happy that the public is joining this, that is why we have decided to hold this competition in 30 talukas this year
 'maharashtra ke mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis ne is maukey par kaha, 'har chiz ke liye sarakar par puri tarah nirbhar hona bhi thik nahin he
 People should step up themselves and work hard only then Maharashtra will be free from drought

 Many people are working on water conservation, but the water cup is educating people, which is different and special
 ' In the era of social media, it is very difficult to sit down to eat with family
 vahiin jab se junk food kaa chalan chalaa he, teble par saath baithkar khaanaa to bachche bhul hi gaye hai
 When they do not sit together and eat, they do not understand the general table manners
 bataa den, teble manurs bhi aapke vyaktitv ke bare kaaphi kuch bayaan karte hai
 So today, tell you those 5 table manners that every child should follow
 napkin kaa prayog karen- bhojan shuru karne se pehle hameshaa napkin apane paas rakhen
 Through that napkin, you not only clean your mouth, but if something falls, you can also clean it
 tej zukam ke samay bhi khate samay apane paas napkin rakhana aavashyak he
 2
 bhojan shuru karne se pehle- teble manurs sirf bhojan karte samay ke liye nahin hote hai
 You have to properly lay the napkin before the food starts
 hameshaa napkin ko apane daaen haath se pakade or fold karke apni god main rakh len
 Whenever you want to get up in the middle of a meal, hang that napkin behind your chair and come back and keep it in your lap
 pati kii maut se sex life khatm, thoka ₹ 8,53,26,000 kaa mukadmaa3
 Eat with your mouth closed - Never talk while eating
 agar munh kholkar khate hai to duusare insaan ke liye wo paristhiti bahut asahaj ho jaati he
 Let me tell you, never put your elbow on the table while eating food, it is not considered good
 4
 If you want anything, tell your partner - this problem is with many children
 agar aapako kabhi kuch khaane kii cheez chahie to apane saathi ko paas karne ke liye kahen
 Such a rise in the middle of a meal does not come in good table manners
 5

 sabko pachhad dene vaala das kaa form to haroonges tha hi
 It was equally surprising to realize that this was the first - yes, first! - clear victory of any Indian athlete in any major international track event
 chaaron taraf jashn or uchhaah kaa maahaul tha
 People's eyes filled up
 tirange ke saath asamiya gamocha (gamchaa) bharat ke gaurav ke nae pratik ban gaye
 Along with the victory, the fame on the internet also came back-to-back with every kind of indigenous slang, including the infamous noise about the caste and regional identity of the slave
 ham hindustani bhale aise hi hon, par is yuva dhavika ne apni kamyaabi or achaanak mili shoharat ko lekar asaadhaaran sanyam, shant tathaa samajhadaar aatmavishvaas kaa pradarshan kiya
 Excerpts from his conversation with Kazu Ahmed: What was going through your mind after winning the race? i don't think anything while running
 main jis cheez kaa intjaar karti or sunati hum, vah 'set' kii aawaaj or gan firing kii aawaaj (baing) ke alaava or kuch nahin hota
 We had prepared well
 mujhe puraa yakeen tha ki main padak jarur jitungi
 i even had the tricolor flag and Gamocha ordered and gave it to Sir after the race
 magar record toduya, itihaas bananaa, yah to maine kisi sapane main bhi nahin sochaa tha
 Being an Indian athlete and Assamese girl, i consider myself very lucky
 or main rashtriya jhande ke saath-saath gamocha duniya ke saamne pesh kar saki, yah baat mujhe garv se bhar detii he
 Your story is very inspiring, to tell the history of a village girl from a family of farmers, it has created a passion in India that anyone can do anything
 
 
 yah sab sach he
 But as far as my background is concerned, it has many aspects
 haa, hamaara kisaan parivaar he
 But my father is also a graduate and he went to ITI (indian Technical Institute)
 agar unke paas apane dastavej or praaanpatr hote to ve bhartiya railway main ejeeniyar ho sakate the
 Unfortunately, he lost his documents in a fire and then lost his interest in securing a job
 hamaara sanyukt parivaar he
 We have about 17 people living and eating together in the same house
 hamaare paas kareeb 60 bigha jameen he or ham saal bhar main kai fasalein ugaate hai
 We have many fish ponds in which fish are also raised
 is lihaaj se maine bade hote hue kabhi koi mushkil nahin jheli
 We eat and drink quite comfortably
 log jo jaanate hai, vah main jo hum, uskaa mahaj 40 fisadi he
 i will tell my story, what am i and where do i come from
 par sahi vakt par bataaungi or apane lakshya hasil karne ke baad bataaungi
 Now is the time to work
 aap iske bare main thodaa-sa hamen abhi bataanaa chahengi?(hansatii hai) thodaa-sa to aap sab jaanate hi hai
 i have said that i was very naughty, stubborn and even a little Bodmaash (crook)
 agar main koi cheez thaan leti hum, to phir vah karke hi maanati hum, jab tak ki mujhe pataa he ki isse kisi ko nuksaan nahin pahonchega
 Who did you call first after this great victory? The first call i made to my coach Nipon Das sir and Nabojit Malakar sir in Assam
 uske baad maine apane mata-pita ko kol kiya
 What was your parents' reaction? They didn't really know what was happening
 jab maine unhen kol kiya, ve sone ja rahe the
 i also did not tell them that i had come in a world match
 jab unhone kaha ki ve sone ja rahe hai, to maine kaha, ''thik he! jaao, so jaao! maine duniya main hangaamaa machaa diya he or tum log sote raho!'' unhone poocha hua kya he? maine unase kaha ki unhen subah pataa chalegaa
 The next morning my father went to the market to sell Ugi cucumber in our farm
 tab unhone hamaare gaanv ke bheetar aata hua tivi channelon kii kaaron kaa kafila dekha
 When the cars from the TV channels hit the road that are usually going towards our house, then they just happened to be like, "jorbonaak Aaji (oh, dear!)
" '' aakhirkaar unhen pataa chal hi gaya (hansatii hai)
 i feel very proud and lucky
 aap ab kai deshon kaa safar kar chuki hai
 Any interesting thing or idea that has come in your mind till now? a big problem came in front of me
 har desh kii apni khaane kii samskruti he jo jaruri nahin ki mere mutabik ho
 So sometimes i have to find the right food according to myself
 magar main manage kar leti hum
 This is not such a big deal
 praha main ham jahaan training le rahe hai, vahaan ek rasoiyaa he
 So we get what we want
 vahaan koi dikkat nahin he
 i discovered rice here (in Tempere) though
 or machhlee bhi
 What do you think about athletes from other countries? i don't care about anything other than my own time
 yah meri akeli chintaa he
 i do not pay attention to anything else
 main samay ke peeche daudti hum
 If it improves, then gold, silver, etc
 will follow
 mujhe kisi cheez kaa dar nahin he
 My goal is always to give my best time
 log mujhase poochhate hai ki main nervas kyon nahin mahasoos karti hum
 i do not
 main samay main or ishwar main vishwaas karti hum
 And nothing bothers me
 bas itanisidhi-si baat he
 What are the plans for the future? The next big match is the Asian Games, which is now just a month away
 vahi abhi praathamikta he
 See what happens there now behtareen samay nikaalane ke liye ham apni behtareen koshish karenge (vahaan se guzar rahi udipari pi
 T
 ushaa kii taraf haath hilaati hai)
 And after the Asian Games? The biggest dream of any athlete is to compete in the Olympics
 ham athleton ke liye vah sabase oonchi chotii he
 There is nothing ahead of him
 main ummid karti hum ki mujhe olympic main daudaahe kaa mauka milegaa
 i will try to find the best time to qualify
 duniya ke khel akhaade main utre abhi mujhe do saal hue hai
 i am not saying that i will always win medals
 par meri lagaataar koshish apana behtareen samay dene kii hogi or agar main vah kar sakati hum to muqabla karnaa (olympic main) pakke taur par mumkin hoga
 This is a dream
 ''hamane sakht vyavastha banaai he''400 me
 The national coach of the race Basant Singh is telling what his star disciple will have to do next "" We didn't really think to reach here
 ham asian games ke liye praha main training kar rahe the
 There were some sports going on in other parts of the world and i told my colleagues that we should not take part in them because a lot of our training time goes into them
 chunki yah muqabla europe main tha or ham usee ilaake main the, isliye maine sochaa, ham yahaan aaenge
 '' '' Hima is still very innocent
 vah har cheez khelnaa chaahati he
 i have to be very strict with him
 yahaan tak ki uski chhuttiyon ko lekar bhi
 Recently we were in Assam and i told Hima that she could go to her house for a night
 baat keval sakht vyavastha ko banaae rakhane kii he
 We cannot take any risk at this time
 maine usase kaha, bas ek maheene kii baat or he
 She can go home for more days after the Asian Games are over
 apni kamai ko lekar bhi vah abhi bahut bholi he
 After the success she has achieved, she will earn a lot of wealth
 spotrs echiver ko sarkaar anivaary taur par jo detii he, uske alaava jab ham hindustan waapas lautenge to tata sareekhee badi korporate companiyaan daudi chali aaengi
 He has no knowledge of all this
 xxrep 4 ' vah ek saal se kaaphi mushkil training le rahi he
 Previously she was a runner of 100 and 200 meters
 400 meter main aae use abhi ek hi saal hua he
 In fact, her performance at the 2018 Commonwealth Games in April (where she came in at number six) impressed me more than her performance here
 yahaan (tempere main) hamen gold kaa pakkaa bharosa tha
 And he showed his jigra
 ''*** Gayatri Prajapati, who was the Minister of Mines in the Akhilesh government of Uttar Pradesh, is not taking the name of the difficulties
 gayatri prajapati rape ke maamle me jail main band hai
 In this case, the victim has filed an application in the court along with two others, accusing Gayatri and her companions of saving their accused in the ongoing gang rape and Poxo Act case
 shikaayat milane ke baad poxo act ke vishesh nyaayadhish ne uchit nirnay karne kaa nirdesh dete hue argiyon ko esaspi ko bhejne kaa aadesh diya he or kaha he ki maamle kii sachai jaanchakar adaalat ko avgat karaayaa jaye
 Will give true testimony against the accused, in this case, the elder girl of the woman who complained against Gayatri and while describing herself as the victim of the case, a young woman gave an application and affidavit in the court stating that she is the victim of the incident
 lekin vaadini or uski maa yah jaanati thi ki vah aropiyon ke khilaaf sahi gavaahi dengi
 On this, Vadini lodged a statement of a young daughter in his place
 apni maa se jaan kaa khatra bataate hue kaha gaya ki report main jis badi ladki se duraachaar hone kii baat kahi gai he vah swayan he jabaki vaadini ne police ke samaksh use pesh na karke choti bahan ko pesh kar bayaan darj karaayaa ki uske saath duraachaar nahin hua
 According to the accused, his mother did so because she was afraid that i would later refuse to testify according to her
 arji main kaha gaya he ki uski choti bahan biimaar rahati he tathaa ghatana ke samay lakhanu ai hi nahin
 Wadini was with her whenever she went to the minister's residence
 jab 17 july 2016 ko uski maa ke saath duraachaar hua to usee din yuvati ke saath bhi duraachaar kaa prayaas hua
 In the court, the young woman and witness Ram Singh filed an application, claiming the threat of life from Wadini and the accused, saying that at the time of the incident the girl was 17 years old and younger sister was 14 years old
 report main bhi vaadini ne apni badi putree kii umr 17 varsh hi bataai thi
 Complaint of harassment for not testifying Ram Singh, an important link in this case, has also complained of harassment for not giving testimony
 court main iske saath ek anya arji bhi di gai jisamen aropiyon par lagaae gaye aarope ko sanshodhit karne kii maang kii gai he
 The court has fixed October 30 for hearing on this
 ye he maamalaapako bataa den ki naaballig se rape ke maamle main gayatri philhal jail me hai
 According to the rape victim, in 2014, on the pretext of getting a job and a plot, she was called by Gayatri Prasad Prajapati at Gautampalli residence in Lucknow
 vahaan chaay main nashila padaarth milakar pilaayaa gaya
 After this, she lost her mind and mind
 peedita kaa yah bhi aarope he ki behoshee kii haalat main mantri or uske sahyogi ne rape kiya tha
 Photos were also taken, making pornographic videos of it
 ashleel video or tasveeron ke jariye gayatri prasad prajapati or unke sahyogi saal 2016 tak use or uski beti ko havas kaa shikaar banaate rahe
 Fed up with this, he lodged the police station on 7 October 2016, but no action was taken by the police
 iske baad peedita soobe ke aaladhikariyon se bhi mili thi
 When the victim did not get justice from the police, she approached the High Court
 lekin vahaan uski yachika ko khaarij kar diya gaya
 Even after this, the victim did not give up
 vah supreme court ke daravaaje par pahunchi
 The Supreme Court gave a strong blow to Gayatri Prasad Prajapati and directed the police to file a case in this case and investigate it fast
 iske baad police ne gayatri prajapati ko giraftaar kar liya tha
 But he kept telling himself innocent
 doctoron kii laaparvaahee se ek danpati ko 4 saal tak maansik yantranaa se guzarana padaa
 He was advised for pregnancy while taking the TB medicine
 isse mahila kii haalat kharaab ho gai or pehla baccha bhi haath se jaataa rahaa
 After a long battle, the Delhi Consumer Forum has ordered a compensation of Rs 25 lakh to the victim
 parivaar ke sadsy maanas ne bataaya, "pushpanjali aspataal kii doctor shraddha jain ne meri patni kaa ek test karavaaya
 On the basis of this test, pressure was created for unnecessary treatment of endometrial TB, which was banned by WHO (world health organization) for treatment of TB
 phir hamen baccha plan karne kii salaah di gai
 It was said that if we do not plan now, we will never have children
 yah bilkul galat salaah thi
 At that time we were 28 years old and we had not even thought about the child
 "maanas ne aage bataaya, phir meri patni garbhvatee hui lekin galat salaah ke kaaran bachche kii jaan khatre main thi or hamane use ganvaa diya
 After this we thought of changing the doctor and we went to the doctor Neena Singh of Fortis le-fame Hospital Greater Kailash
 unhone bhi galat salaah di
 He advised us to have d & c (dialysis and curettage) even after abortion
 meri patni ko bleeding hone ke baad se unhone paisa einthna shuru kar diya
 Then he underwent surgery
 is dauraan unhone garbhashay ke andar placenta ke ek bhaag ko chhod diya, jisase bahut dard hota tha
 After the surgery we again met Doctor Nina Singh
 unhone galati maanate hue dobaaraa d & c karaane ko kaha
 During this time also he did not take precautions
 parinaam yah hua ki meri patni ashrman syndrome se grast ho gayi
 My wife had periods for several months and became a victim of depression
 "aage kii kahani bataate hue maanas ne kaha, " iske baad main or meri patni swapnil kaaphi pareshaan rahane lage
 During this time we went to many doctors
 phir ham doctor punit bedi se mili
 He gave us the right advice
 bedi ne bataaya ki meri patni kii haalat bahut kharaab thi
 She was never in a position to become a mother
 lekin bado ke aashirwad or ek sahi sarjan ke kaaran meri patni garbhvatee hui
 i am thankful to Puneet Bedi and Dr
 Radha Swamy, who have kept the medical profession alive
 varanaa aise kai doctor hai, jinhone is profeshan ko paisa kamaane kaa jariya bana rakhaa he"
 Manas said that he complained to the Delhi Consumer Forum
 ve kai saal tak kanoonee ladaai lade
 After which the State Commission has imposed a fine of 25 lakhs on the wrong treatment of Pushpanjali and Fortis Hospital and doctors
 aspataal ko yah rakam peedit mahila ko muaavje ke rup main deni hogi
 Manas has also requested other couples that if this has happened to them too, they should come forward and fight so that no child in the world dies prematurely

 During the struggle for RTI, most of us were not introduced to you
 aapkaa naam pehle se tha, lekin janalokapal andolan se hi zyaadaatar logon ne aapako janaa
 However, we also know that Jan Lokpal was not your idea

 lekin aam aadmi party ke banane ke baad aapane janalokapal kii ladaai bhi alag kar lee, phir bhi hamane aapaki niyat par shaq nahin kiya
 You continued to call politics a mire and kept repeating that going there makes hands black, but we did not question your political prudence

 lekin ab, jab aapke puraane saathi desh main vyavastha parivartan kii apni jindagi kii sabase ahm ladaai lard rahe hai, to aapako un par shaq umad aayaa he
 This is not right aap madad nahin karte, to kam se kam khyaal rakh sakate the ki is ladaai ke kamjor padane kii vajah na bane
 Anna ji, i have no hesitation in saying that today i doubt your political prudence
 mujhe shaq hota he aapaki chetana ko hijank kar lene vaale un logon par, jo aapke kaan bhar rahe hai
 Those who taught you the meaning of Jan Lokpal, told you the legal complexities, made you sit on the head, made you the second Gandhi of the country, you blamed them

 BJP leader Ashwani Kumar Upadhyay has filed a PIL seeking only 'minority protection' to be actually done to minorities
 yachika main maang kii gai he ki rashtriya alpsankhyak ayog adhinium kii dhara 2(si) ko radd kiya jaae kyonki yah dhara manamaani, ataarkik or anuchhed 14, 15 or 21 kaa ulanghan karti he
 In this section, the Central Government has been given unlimited and arbitrary rights to declare any community as a minority
 yachika main yah bhi kaha gaya he ki hindu jo rashtravyapee aakandon ke anusaar ek bahusankhyak samudaay he, vah purvottar ke kai rajyon or jammu-kashmir main alpsankhyak he
 The petition said that the Hindu community is deprived of the benefits that exist for minority communities in these states
 alpsankhyak panel ko is sandarbh main ‘alpsankhyak' shabd kii paribhaasha par pun: vichaar karnaa chahie
 Thousands of people have been forced to leave their homes due to a forest fire in the Canaries Islands

 Gill said that if any irregularities related to these games, to be held from October 3 to 14, are brought to the notice of the ministry, the ministry will take immediate action
 unhone patrakaron se kaha ki jis cheez kii jaanch karne kii jarurat hogi, uski jaanch kii jaayegi or yah khelon ke baad bhi jari rahegi
 i believe that we should present everything in Parliament and before the people
 gil ne kaha ki khelon kii taiyaariyon or anya muddon par media main jo bhi vibhinn mudden uthaaye ja rahe hai, main unhen dekh rahaa hum
 However these matters may be, under the duty and clear policy of the Ministry, whatever will be brought in our notice will be promptly processed

 The BJP has once again resorted to Muslim ulema
 dilli vidhansabha chunaav ke maddenjar party ne muslim bahul ilaakon main gujarat se aae ulimaon ko vot maangane ke liye bheja he
 BJP has done this experiment before also
 lekin ahm sawaal ye he ki kya loksabhaa chunaav kii tarah dilli ke muslim is baar bhi bhaajapa ko vot denge?dilli kii siyaasi jang tezdilli main chunaav kii taarikh kareeb aate-aate siyaasi jang tej ho gai he
 The contest is directly between the BJP and the Aam Aadmi Party
 dilli kii 70 main se 11 siten to aisi hai jahaan muslim matadaata hi ummidavaar kii kismat kaa faisla karte he
 Well aware of this, BJP, AAP and Congress party are campaigning vigorously in their own way
 bijepi kaa ulema fundaloksabhaa chunaav 2014 main bijepi ne uttar pradesh or bihar samet muslim aabaadi vaale pradeshon main ulimaon or muftiyon kii team prachaar ke liye bheji thi
 Mufti Shamoon Kasmi, who was part of Team Anna, was sent to UP after joining the party
 mufti shamoon kaasmi ol india mufti sanghathan ke ahm padaadhikari bhi hai
 Similarly, MJ Khan, who was once the General Secretary of the Peace Party, was also sent along with the team of Ulama to several states including UP under this strategy
 party kii is kasarat kaa phayda ye hua ki bhaajapa ko loksabhaa chunaav main kul milakar muslimon kaa 10 fisadi vot mila
 Muslim votes were 20 percent in Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, 13 percent in Uttarakhand, Bihar, Punjab and Haryana, 15 percent in Rajasthan and about 6 percent in Uttar Pradesh
 jabaki dilli main bhi kareeb 7 fisadi vot hasil karne main bijepi kaamyaab hui thi
 This was a big deal for the saffron camp
 bhaajapa is prayog ko dohraane ja rahi he
 In Delhi's bjp's exercise, BJP is trying its best to make inroads in Muslim voters
 gujarat se bulaae gaye ulimaon or muftiyon kaa jattha gum-gum kar musalamaanon se bijepi ko vot dene kii apil kar rahaa he
 The Muslim national platform associated with the RSS is already campaigning in Delhi
 aresas ke alpsankhyak morche kaa kaamkaaj dekhne vaale netaa bhi muslim voton main send lagane ke liye har formule par kaam kar rahe hai
 but
 
 
 
 Issues such as rhetoric about minorities, riots and conversions in Delhi and Bihar and proselytization have raised questions since the Modi government came to power
 vipakshi dal bhi in muddon ko lekar muslimon ke bich ho hallaa kar rahe hai
 Now the thing to be seen will be on whom the minority voters will show their faith

 loksabhaa chunaav kii aadhi se adhik ladaai puri ho gai he or ab 23 may ke samikarnon par har kisi kii nazar he
 Amidst the equations, Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati made a big statement, which has started to derive many meanings
 ambedkarnagar kii jansabha main samarthakon kaa josh dekhte hue mayawati ne kaha, ‘lagata he aap namo ko hataanaa chaahate hai or bhim waalon kaa vahaan baithaana chaahate hai’
 Along with this, Mayawati also gave indications of contesting elections from Ambedkaranagar
 yahaan kii jansabha main sansad bhawan ke baahar khadey piem likhe katout dikhaai die to rahi sahi kasar mayawati ne manch se yah kahkar puri kar di
 Mayawati said that you think you want to go to Delhi
 unhone ye bhi kaha ki vah pehle bhi yahaan se saansad rah chuki hai or aapaki bheed dekh kar lagata he ki phir yanha se chunaav ladanaa padegaa
 Ambedkarnagar district is very close to Mayawati, she created this district in 1995 and has also been an MP and 1 time MLA from here
 aapako bataa den ki maujuuda loksabhaa chunaav main mayawati kahin se pratyaashee nahin hai or na hi rajyasabha pratyaashee hai
 But if equations are formed that where there is a possibility of him becoming Prime Minister, then he must reach the House
 or unke bayaan se sanket he ki vah yahaan se hi chunaav lard sakati hai
 Even though Mayawati has made a statement about PM candidature for the first time, but her partner Akhilesh Yadav had indicated this many times
 akhilesh yadav kai maukon par kah chuke hai ki sabhi jaanate hai vah piem pad kii ummidavaari ke liye kiskaa samarthan karenge
 On the PM candidature of SP Patron Mulayam Singh Yadav, he had said that if Netaji becomes PM, it will be good, but he is not in any kind of race right now
 itnaa hi akhilesh bhi har baar kehete aae hai ki is baar desh ko nayaa pradhanmantri milanaa chahie or vah uttar pradesh se hi nikalegaa
 Looking at the history, the highest Prime Minister in the country has come from Uttar Pradesh, even Narendra Modi, who has been in power in Gujarat for a long time, chose UP to become the PM
 gauratlab he ki 2014 main modi lahar kaa gavaah bane uttar pradesh main is baar sapa-basapa kaa gathbandhan hi bijepi ko chunauti de rahaa he
 The SP is contesting 37 seats and BSP 38 seats here
 gathbandhan main bhi mayawati hi bade kii bhoomika main hai, is lihaaj se upi se agar nayaa piem nikalataa he to unki daavedaari or bhi majboot ho sakati he

 We have already told you about this offer
 darasal ek baar 7,777 rupee de kar iphone 7 kaa 32GB vairient kharid sakate hai
 But for two years, you have to pay Rs 2,499 every month as Airtel plan and EMI
 iske tahat har maheene 30GB 4G data diya jayega or analimited colling milegi
 Apart from this, a connection will also be available for the family member, with which you can share data and calling
 ab jaanate hai ki is ofer ke phaayde or nuksaan kya hansbase pehle ye jaan lijie kii iphone 7 ke 32GB vairient kii keemat kitni he bazaar main
 Diwali is a time of many offers on iphone on e-commerce websites
 amejon par iphone 7 kaa 32GB vairient 38,999 rupee main mil rahaa he
 With this, an additional 10% cashback will be available on purchase from SBI card
 yani aap isame se 1,500 rupee kam kar lijie
 Now Rs 37,500
 iske saath no cost iemai bhi mil rahi he yani credit card ke jariye aap agar 6 maheene kii iemai par ise kharidenge to aapse extra paise nahin liye jaaenge
 Apart from Amazon, similar offers are being offered on Paytm Mall and Flipkart
 ab aate hai airtel ke nae ofer par or jodate hai yahaan aapako iphone 7 kitne kaa padegaa
 Once you gave Rs 7,777
 ab 24 maheene tak 2,499 rupee denge
 If you add them, it is Rs 59,976
 ab isamen 7,777 rupee jod den to total 67,753 rupee hote hai
 That is, for the iphone which you can buy now for Rs 37,500 under the offer, you have to pay Rs 67,753
 ab baat karte hai ki airtel kaa ofer kya he jo ise alag banaata he
 For example, if you have purchased iphone 7 from any e-commerce website, then there is no SIM and no plan
 lekin airtel se lenge to saath main sim milegaa or har maheene 30GB 4G data bhi milegaa
 Apart from this, free calling and device protection will also be available
 ek extra conection bhi milegaa jiske saath apana data or colling share kar sakate hai
 Now if you buy from Amazon or any e-commerce website and take such service from another operator, then you may have to pay almost the same amount
 aam taur par kisi oparator se har maheene postped par 30jibi 4ji data or colling lene ke liye aapako 1,500 rupee do dene hi honge agar jeeyo kii baat na karen to
 Because Jio plans are cheap
 haalanki aapako duusare oparator divaais protection nahin milegaa
 But in the amount of money you give to Airtel, you can get a device insured for one year, maybe less
 kyonki 6,000 rupee main aap third party insens company se apane yphone kaa insurance kara sakate hai
 Overall, only those people who need postpaid or postpaid customers can take this offer
 preeped customers ke liye yah plan nahin he jo isaki limitesan bhi he
 Now you can decide yourself how this plan is and whether you should buy it or not

 Bihar's education system is the latest reason for the confrontation between the two

 Tejashwi wrote that Nitish is responsible for Bihar's education system, but to hide his shortcomings, he is trying to remove teachers by making them goats

 JDUK spokesperson Ajay Alok wrote, tweeting, "fierce and question ?? That too on education policy ?? Now politics will be mocked in the country and on August 9, Gandhiji's soul will be shocked when he goes to Bettiah
 "gauratlab he ki tejasvi khud 9veen paas hai or aise main jediu ne un par hi tanj kasate hue sawaal khadey kar die ki akhirtejasvi yadavakis munh se shiksha niti par nitish kumaar se sawaal kar rahe hai??? Shameless front is coming out in Delhi today after long preparation and debate
