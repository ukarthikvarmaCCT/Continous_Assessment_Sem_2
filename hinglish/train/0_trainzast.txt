 nitish ke is kadam ko bihar or rashtriya raajnneeti donon main jediu kaa bijepi ke prati jhukaav ke rup main dekha ja rahaa he
 Nitish Kumar himself has been in power for the last three five years with the help of Dalit votes
 11 saal pehle unhone daliton ke liye nai shrenee jodi thi
 Many schemes for Dalits are running in Bihar
 aise main vot bank par najar rakhkar hi unhone apane gathbandhan saathi se alag faisla kiya he
 Leading party leader Sharad Yadav said, "our grand alliance will not be affected
 " unhone mahagathbandhan ke myne babaate hue kaha ki yah aisa gut he jo pradhanmantri modi ke khilaaf he

 Although officially he refused to say anything

 aise main agar vah lalu kii party rajd or congress kaa saath chhodkar bijepi kaa tham lete hai to unki kursi surakshit rahegi
 Significantly, in 2013, Nitish Kumar broke the alliance with BJP after making Narendra Modi the Prime Ministerial candidate
 haalanki, modi lahar main unhen 40 sadasyeey bihar loksabhaa main keval do site hi naseeb ho pai thim
 In such a situation, Nitish had associated with his political opponent Lalu
 party ke pramukh netaa sharad yadav ne kaha, "hamaara mahagathabandhan prabhavit nahin hoga
 "he explained the meaning of the Grand Alliance and said that this is a group which is against Prime Minister Modi
 jahaan tak raashtrapati chunaav kii baat he to yah bilkul hi alag maamla he
 However, when the presidential election was started, Nitish took the initiative to field Sonia Gandhi as the opposition candidate
 is dauraan lalu bhi unke saath the
 Shocking the Grand Alliance, Nitish praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi in November for calling demonetisation a better move
 isse rajd or congress ne acchhee khaasi naaraazgi jataai thi
 After this, Nitish Kumar praised the role of Prime Minister Modi on the bjp's landslide victory in Uttar Pradesh in March

 tippaniyan Tax authorities on Wednesday questioned Lalu Yadav's daughter in Delhi for six hours
 lalu is baat se chintit he ki nitish kumaar unka bilkul bhi bachaav nahin kar rahe hai
 At the same time, Bihar Congress leaders believe that Nitish is gradually cutting edge with Lalu
 haalanki aadhikarik taur par unhone kuch bhi kehane se inkaar kar diya

 mumbai kii inakam tex investigeshan team ne puure desh main faile share brokers ke aise network kaa pardaafash kiya he, jo farji trade karke apane customer ke ghate or laabh ke saath kaledhan ko bhi saaf karte the
 The tax department has raided several locations of brokers across the country and caught fake trading worth about Rs 6,000 crore
 tex adhikari ne kaha, ''abhi to yah shuruyaat bhar he, ham jald hi badi machhliyon tak pahunchane vaale hai
 To make the stock market transparent, it is necessary to exclude such people from it
 '' tex adhikari ne naam nahin chhapane kii shart par india today se kaha ki isamen bullian kaarobaar se jadi companiyon ke alaava kai bade brokerej house bhi hai
 After this operation we have got many big clues
 dilli-ensiaar main chhapemaritax vibhaag ne dilli, noida, gurugram, gajiabad, mumbai, kanpur, kolkata jaise shaharon main brokers or trading members ke kul 39 thikaanon par chhapemari kii
 The raids began on Tuesday morning and ended on Saturday
 vitt mantralay ke ek bade adhikari kaa kahana he ki ye brokers tex churaane waalon ko madad karte hai
 Brokers conspired with themselves and other brokers to cut the deal themselves
 sabakuch pehle se tay hota tha ki kis client ke trade ko ghaataa dikhaanaa he kise phayda
 Mostly, this forgery trade was being done in illiquid options under futures trading
 ''treding ko kiya monitorcapemari se pehle chah maheene tak in brokers ke trading ko monitor kiya
 After that, about 90 tax officials led by the Mumbai Tax Investigation Team raided the locations of such brokers across the country on suspicious trading related data
 tex adhikari ne kaha ki jin brokers ke yahaan chhapemari hui he unamem se kareeb 80 fisadi brokers ne apane shuruaati bayaan main ye maan liya ki client ke liye ye galat kaam kar rahe the
 The regulator of the stock market, SEBI has also questioned the wrongdoers through synchronized trading related to the plaintiff business from time to time
 kaise kaam karata he derevative market?aam log yahi samajhate hai ki paise dekar share kharid liye jate hai or bechney waalon ko paisa mil jaataa he
 But big business is different from this, which is called futures trading or derivatives
 isamen sheyaron kii delivery nahin hoti
 How far the share price will reach here is the dream business
 ise angreji main 'anderling asset vailu' kehete hai
 To buy and sell shares, there is an agreement between the buyer and the seller that the other party will buy these shares at a fixed time frame and price
 ise future derevative kehete hai
 Suppose Ramesh and Suresh do a future contract
 contract kii shart ye he ki ramesh XYZ bank ke 100 share 500 rupee prati share ke rate se agle do maheene ke bheetar kharid legaa
 Meanwhile, the share price comes to Rs 450
 aise main ramesh ko contract par tay keemat se 50 rupee kaa noshanal ghaataa hone laga
 Now Ramesh has two options
 yaa to wo contract ko do maheene kii expire taarikh se pehle settle kar le or suresh ko 50 rupee prati share ke hisaab se paisa de de
 The second option is to wait until Ramesh expiry date (two months)
 doosraa- maan lijie exapayari ke din XYZ kii keemat 475 rupee par aa jaati he, yani tay contract ke samay kii keemat se 15 rupee kam
 In such a situation, at the time of expiry of the contract, Ramesh will have to pay Rs 1500 to Suresh (rs 15 x 100 shares)
 gaur kariye, yahaan vastav kisi physical share kaa len-dein nahin he
 In this future contract, Ramesh cannot cut the company by saying that the share price is not as per his expectation
 ye bhi hai vikalplekin share bazaar ne ramesh jaise logon ke liye do or vikalp dhund nikaale, jise opshan derevative kehete hai
 In this you have the option that you do not fully accept the terms of the contract
 bas is na maanane ke liye contract ke vakt suresh ko thodaa paisa den de
 It is not bribed, the stock market calls it 'premium'
 ye opshan bhi do tarah ke hote hai agar aap kharidne kaa vikalp lete hai to ise 'kol opshan' kaha jayega or bechney ke kaa vikalp chunate hai to ‘put opshan’
 By giving this premium, Ramesh can reduce the risk of loss in the share price of XYZ and if the share price rises above 500 in two months (till expiry) then Ramesh will get full benefit as per the stipulated condition He only has to pay 500 rupees for every share
 aapako jaanakar hairaani hogi ki bharat sahit share bazaar ke kul turnover kaa bada hissaa derevative main hota he
 For example, we saw the market turnover of the last five days on the National Stock Exchange and the Bombay Stock Exchange
 97 fisadi se zyada kaarobaar derevative yani future and opshan jise bazaar main epa and o bhi kaha jaataa he
 Derivative or futures trading takes place today in every market, whether it is stock market or currency or commodity
 aakhir share brokers kaise phayda pahunchaate the?tex vibhaag ne dekha ki kuch brokers khud do party banakar yaa apane jaise brokers ko party banaakar saude ko anjaam de rahe hai
 These deals are happening in stocks which are illiquid i
e
 where the deals were getting very less
 udhaaharan ke liye ramesh kaa client z he jise chaalu saal main ghaataa hua he or wo chahta he ki uskaa kaala dhan is bazaar ke jariye safed ho jaae
 On the other side is Y, who has made a profit in business gain and wants to make a loss so that the profit can be adjusted
 kul milakar tex na dena pade
 The third is a client who has taken a huge bank loan but his business is not doing well
 unhen dar he ki bank lone ko waapas le saktaa he yaa phir charge badha degaa
 They want fake profits
 ye brokers kamishan lekar in teenon jaruraton ko derevative market se puraa kar rahe the
 
 
 
 maan lijie z or y ek aise hi brokar ke client hai, jisamen se ek ko (Z) nuksaan dikhaanaa he or duusare (Y) ko munafa
 The broker chose a stock where there is not much trade and the trade itself was done by becoming a buyer and seller
 reverse by and cell yani kharid-bikri ke ulte trade ke jariye donon client y or z kii jarurat ko puraa kar diya
 More than two brokers have done the same thing together
 tex vibhaag ne paaya ki desh bhar main kuch brokers apane client ko is tarah kii suvidha de rahe hai
 Signs of involvement of racket companies found in the raid: The CBDT, the largest body of the Income Tax Department, said that in this raid there are indications of the involvement of three penny stocks and some big racket companies in their raids
 sibiditi ne is chhapemari ke baad kaha ki “munafa or nuksaan uthaane vaali kuch companiyon ne is galat tareeke kaa istemaal kiya he
 According to an estimate, around 3500 crores have been adjusted through this
 haal ke search or survey se galat tareeke se labi avadhi vaale yani log turm gen dikhaane waalon kaa bhi pataa chalaa he, jinhone teen penny stox ke jariye kareeb 2000 karod rupee ke munaafe main herapheri kii he”

 *** The Jammu and Kashmir assembly elections were over, and the result was the same, which everyone expected, that is, the hung assembly
 
 
 kisi party ko spasht bahumat nahin
 
 
 PDP and BJP have performed better than in previous elections
 jahaan pidipi sabase zyaada seat jeetne vaali party bani, bijepi ko sabase zyaada vot mili
 
 
 But both of them have not performed well enough to form a government on their own
 bijepi ko 25 siten mili hai or use sarkaar banane ke liye 19 or siton kii darkaar he
 In the Parliamentary Board meeting held in Delhi on 24 December, the BJP claimed that it had the support of 31 mlas, but still 13 mlas are less to form the government, for which it has to take the support of one of the PDP or National Conference Becomes necessary
 ab agar bijepi ko pidipi se samarthan mil jaataa he to sankhya 59 tak ho jaati he, jo sarkaar banane ke liye zarurat se zyaada bada number he, parantu pidipi ke samarthan kaa bijepi ko koi phayda nahin hoga
 The PDP wants to hold the post of CM for six years, while the BJP wants it to be its chief minister for at least three years, if not six, who is Hindu
 pidipi ko sabase zyaada siten kashmir se mili hai, jahaan 97 fisadi muslim rahete hai
 The PDP is well aware that there is an anti-bjp wave in Kashmir, so it has placed such a condition before the BJP
 bijepi ko agar apana mukhyamantri bananaa he to uske liye sabase adarsh party umr abdulla kii neshnal conference hi hogi, jinke paas 15 vidhayak hai, or isi ke chalate umr abdulla abhi molbhav karne kii sthiti main bhi nahin hai, lekin haa, agar bijepi kii sarkaar ko neshnal conference samarthan detii he to use phayda zarur mil saktaa he
 Along with the assembly of Jammu and Kashmir, it can find a place in the Union Cabinet
 vaise to umr abdulla chunaav se pehle hi baikfoot par chale gaye the, or ab bhi vah bhale hi bijepi se koi deal hone se inkaar kar rahe hon, lekin vah yah jaanate hai ki rajya kii raajnneeti main bane rahane or janata kaa vishwaas dobaaraa hasil karne ke liye satta main bane rahanaa bahut zaruri he
 On the other hand, after forming the government in Haryana, BJP chose Manohar Lal Khattar, who is Punjabi, instead of choosing a Jat leader for the post of Chief Minister
 haryana main 18 saal baad koi gaiyr-jat mukhyamantri bana he or haryana main pehali baar bijepi kii sarkaar bani he
 Meanwhile, now for Jharkhand, BJP has also stamped the name of Raghubar Das as the first non-tribal chief minister of the state
 so, bijepi kii isi niti ke tahat lagata he ki jammu-kashmir main bhi bijepi kisi hindu ko mukhyamantri bananaa pasand karegi
 By the way, there is one more thing
 
 
 agar bijepi ko kashmir main bhi kuch siten mil jaatin to bijepi kii ichha hoti yaa nahin hota, use donon kshetron - jammu or kashmir - main santulan banaae rakhane ke liye kisi muslim netaa kaa naam sochna hi padataa, lekin ab jab party ne sabhi siten sirf jammu se hi jiti hai to bijepi kisi muslim naam par sahmati banaakar jammu ke votaron kaa gussa mol lenaa nahin chaahegi
 Dr
 Jitendra Singh's name is leading in the race for the Chief Minister's post in BJP, another leader like Dr
 Nirmal Singh is also in the race
 dow jitendra singh udhampur se bijepi saansad hai or piemo main rajyamantri hai
 Jitendra, 58, is considered close to Modi and BJP president Amit Shah
 unhone loksabhaa chunaav main congress netaa gulam nabi aaazaad ko haraaya tha
 If sources are to be believed, most of the mlas also want to see Jitendra Singh as the Chief Minister
 agar unke naam par sahmati ban jaati he or bijepi kii sarkaar banati he to vah jammu-kashmir ke agle siem honge
 It is the same Jitendra Singh, who created a stir in the politics of the valley by making a statement on Article 370 on the second day of the formation of the Modi government, although he later reversed his statement
 udhar, dow nirmal singh billaavar vidhansabha kshetra se chune gaye hai
 He has also been the party's state president, and it is notable that the BJP won the Billawar seat after 37 years, but the screw is that not all the mlas agree on his name
 sutron ke mutabik bijepi ke kam se kam chah vidhayak nirmal singh ko vidhayak dal kaa netaa banaae jane ke khilaaf hai
 Now the party legislators have left the decision on national president Amit Shah to whom he selects the leader of the legislative party
 agar itihaas par nazar daalen to jammu-kashmir ke pehle 'pradhanmantri' mehrchand mahajan the, jo hindu the
 If the BJP succeeds in its strategy in the coming days, then those days are not far when the first Hindu Chief Minister will also be seen in the valley
 bijepi zarur chaahegi ki vah ghati main itihaas banaae or pradhanmantri modi ko nae saal kaa aitihaasik tohfa de

 Its stories — and also the title — have efficiently captured the aspirations that have made their way to new highways and tollways passing through a variety of small towns
 daamer se pare kai virtual hive bhi hai jo puure desh ko ek-duusare se jod rahe hai
 Their reach is inside the houses
 bahut hi andar: drawing room, study or bedroom tak
 But the highways that bring new thinking (and new products) to markets and homes are not able to completely eliminate the old structures of recognition and practice
 manyataon ke mukaable technology kaaphi teji se badal rahi he or jahaan in donon kaa milan hota he vahaan aakankshaayen takaraati hai or ichchhaaon ko koi sira nahin miltaa
 2012 nielsen-india Today sex done in four metros (new Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata and Chennai) and 12 smaller cities (hisar, Moradabad, Kota, Kolhapur, Jamnagar, Ratlam, Salem, Kottayam, Guntur, Asansol, Baleshwar and Aizawl) The small towns that emerged in the survey have reached a point where rapidly changing times are clashing with very slowly changing beliefs
 india today ke is dasven vaarshik sex survey se pataa chalata he ki desh ke anya ilaakon ke log purvottar ko duusare desh kii tarah dekhte hai
 This is clearly visible in the case of some aspects of inter-personal relationships
 isi prakaar, mizoram kii rajdhani izol ke kaaphi log (79 fisadi) apane sex jivan ko santoshjanak maanate hai
 Although the raw data does not tell us what "satisfaction" means to the people, it is worth considering that Aizawl — a city located in an area where normal life has been largely disrupted — people
 In comparison to other small cities of the country, a higher level of happiness was seen about their day-to-day social life and economic condition
 purvottar main pasri ashaanti ne vahaan mard-auraton ke tulanaatmak udaar samparkon kii parampara ko zyada nahin badla he
 Therefore Aizawl has the highest percentage of people who have nominated their boyfriend / girlfriend as the first sex partner
 vahaan liv-in relationships main rahane waalon or ek se zyada sex partner waalon kii sankhya bhi apekshaakrit zyada he
 Aizawl has the highest number of girlfriends or girlfriends going on a date (89 per cent), while in Moradabad and Guntur it is 3 per cent and 2 per cent respectively
 izol kaa ooncha aankada ek baar phir se vibhinn saamaajik or saanskrithik mulyon ko darshata he
 The small number of dating in small towns suggests that such contacts come in public activities and there is little room for such activities
 mal, multiplex or saarvajanik parkon jaisi jagahon ke badaae se is paristhiti main badlaav aayega, jahaan premi jode bina kisi tarah kii pratadia ke yaa pahachaane jane ke dar ke bina gum sakenge
 The desire to have boyfriends, girlfriends, and dating was clearly stated and in most cities (all except Moradabad) a large number of people admitted that they had fallen in love with someone of the opposite sex
 yah koi achraj kii baat nahin he, pyaar or romance cosmopolitan pahchaan ko jaahir karne ke liye mahatvapurn pahalu hai or saath hi ye abhi ke kanjumar culture kaa bhi ek mahatvapurn hissaa hai
 Both these aspects nurture a world of desire that keeps on searching for new paths
 yah bhi rochak baat he ki kota main tulanaatmak rup se zyada logon (50 fisadi) ne is baat ko sweekaar kiya ki ve date par ja chuke hai
 The reason for this may be that due to the coaching industry a large number of youth live there
 aakhir duniyavi safalataa or intimesi kii modern aakanksha akasar saath-saath chalati he
 Kiss has played an important role in thinking about modern intimacy in India
 aadhunik se bhi zyada ise ‘‘bahut zyada’’ pashchimi or ‘‘asli’’ bhartiya samskruti se baahar kii cheez mana jaataa he
 Our films have figured out the most extraordinary ways of signaling kisses without showing them
 is survey se logon ke ravaiye main badlaav ke mahatvapurn sakshya milte hai
 In fact, the percentage of small towns is higher than the four metros (for example, 89% of the quota people accept it, compared to 81% in Mumbai)
 ek or sawaal ke jawaab main survey main shaamil log chumban ko bhaavnaatmak mahatv vaale ehsaas ke rup main paryaapt mahatv dete hai (jamnagar main 90 fisadi or selem main 78 fisadi)
 Changing the attitude about kissing is actually part of the change in the way people think about themselves
 inase yah sanket to miltaa hi he ki lagaav jaahir karne ke bare main soch badal rahi he, hamen yah bhi pataa chalata he ki ek duusare maamle main apni alag pahchaan kii nai bhaawanaaon kaa vikaas ho rahaa he
 The desire for romance is part of the fantasy of being modern and is associated with the idea of making one's own decisions (choosing a partner, for example) and living life accordingly
 log apane partner main kin gunon kii talash karte hai? is sawaal ke kai bahut rochak jawaab mili hai
 The most preferred qualities for a potential dating partner are maturity and openness
 ‘‘yon aakarshan’’ sabase nichle paaydaan par aata he
 Does this mean that in this unstable time - and if the dating partner becomes a husband and wife - mature thinking is needed? And when people look for a life partner, they decide on logic instead of emotion? Perhaps this is why people trust friends and people like themselves more than speculating to find a suitable partner
 Huh
 lekin yah baat saamne ai he ki ‘‘saundarya’’ ko ‘yon aakarshan’ se alag dekha jaataa he
 a large number of people said that the quality of beauty in their partners attracted them
 lekin saundarya shaayad dekhne vaale kii najar main hota he
 Apart from the evidence of changes, this survey also reminds us that small cities are the leaders of long-standing beliefs and have not changed
 isliye survey main shaamil zyaadaatar logon ne yahi sanket diya he ki unka sirf ek yon saathi rahaa he or unke pati yaa patni hi unki adarsh yon saathi he
 The pace of change has not changed the attitude about the importance of married life
 isse antarangta or sambandh ke kai anya pahaluon ke bare main bhi logon kii soch main badlaav nahin aayaa he
 Therefore, a large number of men and women both hope that their life-partner's virginity is protected
 or bhale hi sex ke prati ravaiya badal rahaa ho-guntur ke 56 fisadi logon ne yon phantasy kii baat kabool kii he-lekin is survey main hissaa lene vaale zyaadaatar logon ne bataaya ki shaadi ke samay unka comarya surakshit tha
 Once again, reality is not as important as thinking about virginity
 ratlam ne is rukh ko palat diya he: sirf 11 fisadi yah maanate hai ki shaadi ke samay unke partner kaa comarya surakshit rahaa hoga
 There are many other important cases in which the wall of long-standing cultural beliefs has been filled with winds of change
 bahut kam sankhya main logon ne yah sweekaar kiya ki yon jivan santoshjanak na rahane par ve dobaaraa shaadi kar sakate hai, or bahut zyada logon (muradabad main 84 fisadi or baleshwar main 73 fisadi) ne liv-in relationships ko khaarij kiya
 Similarly, dating is acceptable, but premarital sex has received very little acceptance
 lekin kota ke 22 fisadi logon ne ‘‘rajamandi se sambandh’’ kii baat sweekaar kii
 In Kota, there is also a higher percentage of those who accept that sexual fantasies have an important role to play when making sex and have had sex with a person of the same sex
 pratiyogi parikshaon kii aakanksha ke liye preshracukar kii bhoomika nibhaa rahaa kota antarangta ke maamle main prayog karne vaala shahar bhi ban gaya he
 Despite not shying away from experimenting in sexual life — 22 per cent of Ratlam's people surveyed have used sex toys and 59 per cent of Kottayam people have watched pornographic movies — there are only a few ways to have sex
 More experimentation is accepted
 isliye homosexuality or bisexuality kii sweekaaryata bhi us hisaab se bahut kam he, jaisaa ki vipareet lingi logon or transgender logon ke bich he
 This actually shows us the attitude of the people more than the actual trend because empirical evidence tells a different story
 udhaaharan ke liye, shaadishuda mard bisexual (ubhayalingi) sambandh banaate paae gaye hai
 It also appears in many small towns
 ham aisi duniya main hai jahaan kalpanaaon kii udaan paramparaon kii simaaon ko nahin maanati
 The sex life of small towns in India tells us a lot about social and cultural complexities
 shaayad iskaa sabase ullekhneey pahalu yah he ki hisar, kolhapur or kota ke log ab iske bare main baat karne ko taiyaar dikhte hai

 salmaan khan ko paanch saal kaid kii sajaa sunaane vaale seshans court ke jaj di dablyoo deshpandey ne film abhinayta ko kadi naseehat bhi di he
 He said in his decision that if Salman had not really done anything wrong then why did he not go to the police at that time and ran away
 'aaj tak' ke pasfaisle kii exclusive copihai, jisamen jaj ne kaha, 'agar aaropee ne aparaadh nahin kiya tha to vah logon ko is baat ke liye manaa sakate the ki driver ke khilaaf karrwai kii jaani chahie
 But Salman did not even wait for the police to come to the scene and he went to his house
 subah 10:30 baje tak unhone khud ko chhipaae rakhaa
 'the accused did not take any positive initiative: The court said,' If indeed Salman Khan had not done anything wrong, he could immediately go to the police and inform about the incident
 yah dhyaan main rakhane yogya tathy he ki salmaan ne ghayalon ko aspataal main jaakar dekhne, unki medical madad karne yaa police ke saath dobaaraa ghatnasthal par pahunchane jaisaa koi sakaaratmak kadam bhi nahin uthaaya

 ye ofer limited time ke liye hi he
 This talk time is for non-live calling
 Reliance Jio ne apane customers ke liye 30 minute free tok time dene kaa elaan kiya he
 This will be for non-live calling
 chunki company ne haal hi main non jeeyo colls ke liye yugers se paise lene kaa faisla kiya he, isliye customers ko khush karne ke liye aisa kiya ja rahaa he
 However this is a limited period offer
 report ke mutabik Reliance Jio ke is faisle ke baad customers main naaraazgi he or wo free karne liye online pitishan file kar rahe hai
 Keeping this in mind, the company has decided that customers will be given 30 minutes free talk time
 haalanki ye tok time yugers ke richarge karne par hi milegaa
 It is worth noting that after the announcement of placing money on non Jio calls, Jio has issued some packs which all Jio users will have to make
 jeeyo yugers ko massej ke jariye ye notification diya ja rahaa he
 It is being told that Reliance Jio will give 30 minutes free talk time only to those users who recharge within 7 days of this announcement of Jio
 yani ise paane ke liye jeeyo yugers ko 17 oktober se pehle top ap karana hoga
 When do you have to recharge? By the time the current plan runs, you will be able to call Non Jio users free of charge, but as soon as the old validity is over you will have to top up another with your validity pack
 top ap ke baad hi aap non jeeyo yugers ko kol kar paaenge
 That is, if the validity of your current plan ends after a few days, then you will probably not get 30 minutes of free talk time
 gauratlab he ki haal hi main Reliance Jio ne IUC kaa hawala dete hue duusare network par colling ke liye har minute 6 paise lene kaa elaan kiya he
 Although other telecom companies also have to pay IUC, but so far no such announcement has been made by Airtel and vodafone-idea
 ek report ke mutabik pichley saal IUC dene ke maamle main vodaphone number-1 thi, jabaki rilayans jeeyo tisare number par thi

 Giving information about legal procedures, Lionel Hurst said, "mr
 Choksi has said that he may have a lot of trouble in the long journey to India, so he does not want to travel to India under any circumstances, in such a situation, this case It has been where the court has to play an important role, the role of political leadership has reduced in this, we have given a petition before the court, but in any case we have to ask the court The instructions did not get Choksi be the Diport or extradited

 China's wheel, called the world's factory, is slowing down
 somvaar ko jari aankadon ke mutabik china main aarthik vikaas dar saal ke antim teen maheenon main 6

 yah beete 28 varsh main vikaas kaa sabase nichalaa str he
 Whether the speed of investment in the economy or the spending capacity of consumers, production of factories, exports around the world, China seems to be lagging behind on every economic front
 yahi kaaran he ki duniya kii duusari sabase badi arthvyavastha par sankat ke badal madra rahe hai
 China's exports in December 4 over last year

 Imports also fell to 7
 6 fisadi kii dar par aa gaye
 This is the lowest level since July 2016
 china main utpaadan gatividhiyaan beete 19 maheenon main pehali baar kam hui hai
 The reason for this is the decrease in demand from consumers even after the companies were given large disconnects, due to which the orders of the companies were weakened
 companiyon kii ore se lone lene kii raftaar beete 10 varshon main sabase kam he
 The total debt from governments, institutions and citizens in China has reached three times the GDP
 china kii chintaa main duniyabar kii arthvyavasthaaon kaa dublaa hona laazmi he
 The reason for this is that China's share in the world's total economic activities is to be close to 19 percent
 yani china main sankat ke chhinte duniyabar kii arthvyavasthaaon par padegaa yaa kah lijie ki anya arthvyavasthaaon main susti ke kaaran hi china dikkat main he
 What will happen to India? The slow pace of economic growth in China will cause the currency to weaken
 isse bharat jaise un deshon ko phayda hoga jo china se aayaat karte hai
 However, another aspect is that domestic producers will have to pay the price because their profits are bound to hurt in order to compete with China's cheap goods
 iske alaava china ko niryaat karne vaale deshon ko nuksaan hoga
 Countries like India will be the first choice outside of China to explore new markets because the big market is available here
 aise main agar companiyon apane menuphaccharing plant desh ke baahar lagaati hai to bharat jaise deshon main buniyadi dhaanche ko raftaar mil sakati he

 Geetanjali, the classical work of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore, is not an introduction
 
 
 bengal hi nahin india ke sabase bade iken main se ek tagore kii rachanaaen vakt se pare hai
 
 
 On which neither the time has nor the relevance has been lost
 
 
 tagore kii nijee jindagi ke panne bhi bangla bhadralok se lekar desh-videsh tak main jane jate rahe hai
 But one page of Tagore's life which has never appeared before the world, now he is coming out through a film

 In this film, the beautiful relationship between Victoria and Tagore is being shown very beautifully
 is film kii shooting pashchim bengal ke bolpur main hogi jabaki baaki kaa hissaa argentina or france main filmaaya jayega
 The film is an attempt to narrate Tagore's passionate and intimate relationship with Victoria
 iske liye parde par 1920 ke us daur ko saakaar karne kii taiyaari he jab tagore or victoria kii yah prem kahani paravaan chadhi thi
 Tagore and Victoria's Love Storytagor began as such, with their creations being relevant at all times
 
 
 lihaaja ummid kii jaani chahie ki jab yah film aegi to isaki gunj puri duniya main sunai degi
 According to the film's producer Suraj Kumar, the Argentine government is supporting this project a lot

 Tagore was so impressed with the knowledge of many languages that he dedicated his collection of poems to East Victoria in 1925
 tagore se victoria kii pehali mulaakaat november 1924 main hui
 Tagore went on a trip to Peru when he fell ill
 us daur main kam se kam 6 maheene safar main lagate the, aise main tagore aaraam m karne ke liye argentina ke bunus yrs main ruke, tagore kaa vahaan ruknaa us daur kii badi khabar thi
 Hearing the discussion, Victoria came to meet Tagore at the hotel where he was staying
 victoria ne unhen salaah di ki hotel kaa maahaul unki sehat ke lihaaj se mufeed nahin
 Victoria rented a house exclusively for Tagore where much of Tagore's two-month stay was spent
 tagore se victoria kii duusari mulaakaat 1930 main hui jab tagore kii paintings kii pradarshnee kaa aayojan paris main hua
 This event was organized by Victoria

 before his death, the sequence of letters continued between Tagore and Victoria

 Tagore also wrote about 30 poems during his Argentine stay
 yahaan ek baat or bhi dhyaan dene kii he
 That is India's relationship with Latin American countries
 tagore kii yah kahani mahaj platonic pyaar kii dastaan nahin balki ye bhi jaahir karti he ki us daur main bhi bharat ke rishte latin america deshon se kitne majboot the
 Apparently, the initiative is being taken to freshen and strengthen these relationships through this film

 Not only this, action will be taken against those who do business of adulterated goods under National Security Act (NSA) and Gangster Act
 vaise pradhanmantri ko milavati saamaan vaala koi bhi vyanjan nahin parosa gaya tha or jin chizon main milawat paayi gayi thim unhen menu se hataa diya gaya tha
 District Magistrate (DM) of Kanpur Nagar, Mukesh Meshram said that under adulteration Khoro will not be spared any longer and the campaign against them was already going on but now this campaign will be expedited
 unhone kaha ki milawat karne waalon ke khilaaf enese or gangster act ke tahat karrwai kii jaayegi taaki use jaldi adaalat se jamaanat na mil sake or vah dobaaraa milawat kaa kaarobaar karne kii himmat na kar saken
 Significantly, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh came to the city on July 3 to attend the convocation ceremony of IIT Kanpur
 do din pehle espiji ne pradhanmantri ko jo khaanaa parosa janaa tha uske rashan ke 25 namoonay public analist lab lakhanu main jaanch ke liye bheje the
 According to the DM, two hours before the arrival of the Prime Minister, the district administration received a report from the lab that there is an adulteration of the moong dal served to the Prime Minister and melon seeds (musk Melon) used in sweets
 iske baad is babat turant espiji ko suchit kiya gaya or espiji ne in dono khaadya padaarth kaa istemaal roak diya
 After this incident, the IIT administration also swung into action and ordered an inquiry into the matter as the ration of the food which was to be served to the Prime Minister was given by the ration supplier in the IIT

 This included almost all foods ranging from pulses, gram flour, oil, rice, milk, khoya, paneer, ice cream
 dm ke mutabik isamen se kareeb 91 khaadya padaarth ke namoono kii report jila prashasan ke paas aa gayi he or inamen milawat kii pushti ho gayi he
 Now the district administration is preparing to register an FIR against all these adulteration businesses and there will be no concession of any kind in this case

 nakli or milavati saamaan bechney waalo ke khilaaf koi karrwai kyon nahi hoti he, is sawaal ke jawaab main nagar nigam ke ek aalaa adhikari kehete he ki kanpur uttar pradesh main milavati khaadya padaarth kaa sabase bada kendra banataa ja rahaa he or yahaan har saamaan main milawat paayi ja rahi he
 Since January 2010, the municipal corporation has raided various places in the city and caught huge quantities of adulterated khoya, indigenous ghee, spices, salted lentils, tea leaves and many adulterated foodstuffs
 unhone kaha ki vibhaag kaa kaam hota he nakli or milavati maal ko sil karnaa or unke namoonay lekar lakhanu sthit laboratory bhejnaa jab vahaan se report aa jaati he ki yah saamaan ke namoono main milawat hui he tab hamen aage kii karrwai karte he
 Officials say that we cannot take any action until a report is received from a lab in Lucknow
 ab jab kuch maamlo main report aa gayi he to karrwai karenge
 Municipal corporation officials say that the report of adulterated samples should come within forty days from the laboratory located in Lucknow, but sometimes it takes several months to get this report, due to which there is no action against those who trade adulterated goods
 Wish dm meshram ne shahar kii janata se bhi apil kii he vah shahar main kahin bhi kisi khaadya padaarth main milawat paayen to unke mobile par esemes ke jariye sandesh de sakate hai us milawat khor ke yahaan turant chapa markar karrwai kii jaayegi

 antbi airport par uganda kii sena ke kareeb 100 jawan maujuud the jinhone puure airport ke apane ghare main le rakhaa tha
 After this, all the passengers are taken down one by one by plane and they are taken to the transit hall of the airport which was not in use at the moment
 ab tak kareeb choubees ghante guzar chuke the or vimaan ke hijank hone kii khabar duniya bhar main fail chuki thi
 Not only was Idi Amin aware of this entire hijacking, but his support was also open to the actors
 kehete hai ki idi amin har rose khud antbi airport aata tha or suraksha vyavastha kaa jayja letaa tha
 June 28, 1976, after hijacking Antby Airport, ugandawiman, Hijackers made their demand for the first time
 hijacrs kaa makasad tha israelki jelon main band 40 philistini aatankwaadiyon ko chhudaana
 In addition, the terrorists also wanted the release of their thirteen and associates in jails in Kenya, France, Switzerland and West Germany
 kul 53 aatankvagadiyon kii rihaai ke saath-saath unhone paanch milian america dollar kii bhi maang rakhi
 In the absence of demand, the terrorists threatened to kill the hostage passengers one by one from the morning of July 1976
 yani isroyal sarkaar kon maangen maanane ke liye sirf 48 ghanton kaa vakt diya gaya
 On June 29, 1976, the Army of Antby Airport, Ugandayuganda divides the captured passengers in the transit hall of the airport into two groups
 jitne gaiyr israeli naagarik the unhen airport ke hi vatting haul main le jaakar kaid kar diya jaataa he
 Whereas 12 members of the Air France crew and a total of 94 Israeli civilians are held together in the same transit hall
 30 june 1976, antbi airport, ugandamangen maane jane kii mohalat kaa aakhri din khatm hone ja rahaa tha
 Meanwhile, hijackers release 48 passengers from non-israeli hostages
 inamen se zyaadatak bujurg or biimaar the
 All these passengers are sent to Paris by a special aircraft
 1 july 1976, antbi airport, ugandahaijakairs kii di gai mohalat khatm hoti usase thik pehle israeli sarkaar ne hijakairs tak paigaam bhijwaya ki wo baatcheet ke liye taiyaar he
 But they should be given some more time
 apaherta israeli sarkaar kii baat maan lete hai or maange maanane kii dedline 4 july 1976 kii dopaher tak badha dete hai
 Not only this, they release a hundred more non-israeli citizens only after a few hours
 in sabhi logon ko bhi special vimaan se paris bhej diya jaataa he
 Now there were only 94 Israeli nationals, ten young travelers from France and 12 crew members from Air France, a total of 116 passengers in the transit hall of Antby Airport
 isroyal kii sarkaar ke liye ye vakt behad mushkil bharaa tha
 Because neither could she push her citizens and crew members of the flight to death like this nor accept the demands of the terrorists
 kyonki israeli sarkaar kaa ye usul rahaa he ki wo kisi bhi keemat par aatankwaadiyon se deal nahin karenge
 But how can they get rid of their citizens by entering their enemy countries so far away from Israel? This work was almost nominal
 hijakars kii di gai mohalat najadik aati ja rahi thi
 During this period, the Israeli government made all efforts to get the hostages released by putting pressure on Idi Amin from his friendly African countries and the rest of the world
 magar baat nahin bani
 However, with the talks, the Israeli government was also working on the idea of releasing the hostages through a rescue operation
 3 july 1976, israelbandhakon kii rihaai ke raste band the
 So at 6:30 pm on July 3, the Israeli cabinet took the final decision
 faisla rescue mishan kaa
 Brigadier General Dan Samaron was made the commander of the operation
 plan behad jokhim bharaa tha
 Because it was the largest and most dangerous rescue operation at any airport in the world
 israeli commandos ko ye mishan bijli kii teji se puraa karnaa tha
 Therefore, this operation was named Operation Thunderbolt
 is dauraan israeli khufia agency mosaad lagaataar apana kaam kar rahi thi
 After talking to the released non-israeli hostages, Mossad had gathered all the important information about Antby Airport and its part
 jahaan bandhakon ko rakhaa gaya tha
 With this, the exact number of hijackers and Ugandan army was also discovered
 isi bich mosaad ko pataa chalaa ki 1960 or 70 ke dauraan israel kii ek construction company ne africa ke kai deshon main bahut si imaaraten banaai thim
 Even that terminal of Antbi Airport in Uganda was built by the same company
 company ke jis israeli ejeeniyar ne wo terminal banaaya tha uski madad se mosaad ne us jagah kaa puraa nakshaa bana liya jahaan bandhakon ko rakhaa gaya tha
 3 July 1976, according to Sharm el-sheikh, Israelplan, a team of hundred Israeli commandos fly from the Israeli Air Force's four C-130 Hercules transport aircraft from Sharm El Sheikh Airport to Uganda's Antbi
 in khaas vimaanon main kaale rang kii ek marcides car or land rover kaaren bhi thim
 Actually Mossad had discovered that Idi Amin is fond of a black Mercedes and always gets out in the same car
 jabaki uske saath khaas suraksha dasta land rover car main hota he
 The idea was that as soon as they landed at the airport, these cars would be traveling towards the terminal
 taaki uganda kii sena ko lage ki idi amin kaa kafila he or wo aasaani se terminal main dakhil ho jaaen
 But with silence, it was not easy to land four planes at Antby Airport
 uganda kii air spes main chori-chupe ghusna tha
 Without the knowledge of Antby air traffic control and this was possible only when the aircraft flew at very low altitude
 tees meter yani sau feet se zyada kii oonchai par nahin
 Two Boeing 707 aircraft also flew with four cargo aircraft from the Israeli Airforce
 pehla bowing jisamen medical team maujuud thi wo nerobi airport par ruk gaya
 While the other Boeing had to land at Antby Airport to bring the hostages back
 3 july 1976, antbi airport, uganda, raat 11 bajethik yahi vakt tha jab israeli airforce ke chaar vimaan behad nichi udaan bharte hue or antbi airport ke trephic control ko dhokhaa dete hue ranve par utar padate hai
 In the dark of night, the four aircraft were landed at the airport in such a way that the Ugandan army and the terrorists present there did not even get the news
 vimaan kaa cargo dwaar pehle se khulaa tha
 One by one, Mercedes and Land Rover cars hit the runway
 unamem pehle se hi commandos baithe the
 This crack team of a hundred Israeli commandos was divided into three parts
 inamen se ek team ko airport ke terminal main bandhak bana kar rakhe gayi musafiron ko chhudaane kaa kaam saunpa gaya
 While the other team was ambushed on the runway of the airport to combat the Ugandan army and the terrorists
 or teesri team kii jimmedaari thi chhudaae gaye musafiron ko saath laae khaali jahaaj main baithaana
 As soon as he entered the building, bullets started firing
 israeli commando mike par english or hebrew main chilla rahe the ki "ham israeli sainik hai, let jaao let jaao
 "commands shot 3 kidnappers
 tabhi ek 19 saal french ladka khada ho gaya
 The commandos deemed him a kidnapper and shot him
 iske alaava do or bandhak bhi kros firing main maare gaye
 The 3 hijackers hid in each other's room seeing the Commandos
 magar israeli commandos ne us kamare main grenade phenke or goliyon kii bauchhaar kar di
 All three were killed
 israeli commandos ne apane is plan ko bakhubi nibhaayaa
 First they took hostages in their circle
 duusari team uganda kii sena par tut padi
 Within half an hour, all hijackers were eliminated and the passengers were taken to a safe plane
 is puri karrwai kaa jayja hawaii adde ke upar chakkar kaat rahe ek paanchaven hawaii jahaaj main baithe oparation ke commander, general adam khud le rahe the
 Seven hijackers, and 48 Ugandan army personnel were killed in this operation
 jabaki airport par khadey uganda ke kareeb 30 vimaanon ko bhi jate-jate irzaili commandon ne tabah kar diya
 So that no one can chase them
 cross firing main teen israeli bandhakon kii bhi maut ho gai jabaki paanch commando ghayal hue
 Israeli unit commander Yonatan Netanyahu was killed in the operation
 yonthan netanyahu israel ke maujuuda praadhanmantri benjamin netanyahu ke bade bhai the
 53 minutes of operation, 30 minutes of commando action
 During this entire operation, Mossad suffered only one loss of life
 haalanki 10 commando ghayal bhi hue
 This whole operation of Mossad on foreign land lasted only 53 minutes and out of which commando action took 30 minutes
 uganda ke taanashaah idi amin ke liye yah khun kaa ghunt pine jaisaa tha
 He could not believe that anyone could enter his country and take away his citizens
 maharashtra main bijepi or shivasena ke bich abhi tak gathbandhan kaa formula tay nahin ho sakaa he
 Where BJP is making all efforts for alliance with Shiv Sena on one side
 vahiin, duusari ore shivasena bhi maukey kii najaakat ko samajhate hue bijepi ke saath mol bhav main juty he
 The Shiv Sena is talking of an alliance with the BJP based on Bal Thackeray's model in 1995
 angreji akhbaar ichonamiks times ke report ke mutabik shivasena kii nazren 1995 model par hai
 In an alliance with the BJP, Shiv Sena is claiming about 150 seats in Maharashtra's 288-seat assembly and 25-26 out of the total 48 seats in Maharashtra for the Lok Sabha elections
 shivasena ne apni is demand ko bijepi alaakaman ke paas bhej diya he
 If sources are to be believed, the Shiv Sena said that the alliance in Maharashtra should be made only when it is made an ally under the 1995 model
 darasal maharashtra main pehali baar bijepi or shivasena gathbandhan kii sarkaar 1995 main bani thi or mukhyamantri kaa taj shivasena ke manohar joshi ke sar sajaa tha
 The Shiv Sena has suggested the first to tie up with the BJP that the Fadnavis government should be dissolved and assembly and Lok Sabha elections held simultaneously in Maharashtra
 iske alaava shivasena ne duusari shart rakhi he mukhyamantri kaa pad use diya jaae
 Not only this, Shiv Sena wants 150 seats from BJP out of total 288 seats in Maharashtra Assembly
 is tarah se loksabhaa kii 48 siton main se 25 se 26 siton kii demand rakh rahi he
 However, BJP is not easy to accept these three demands of Shiv Sena, as it was due to these insistence of Shiv Sena in the 2014 assembly elections that it alone contested
 bijepi sabase badi party banakar ai or baad main shivasena ko uske saath milakar sarkaar bananaa padaa he
 At the same time, the way Shiv Sena's attitude towards the alliance with BJP suggests that it is not easy to accept
 shivasena netaa sanjay raut lagaataar vipaksh ke manchon par najar aa rahe hai
 On Monday too, he reached the stage of TDP President Chandrababu Naidu

 41 inch kaa phul HD+ (2340 x 1080) disple he or khaas baat ki yah AMOLED ke saath he
 One thing you will notice is that there is no fingerprint scanner anywhere in the front or back of this device
 isaki vajah yah he ki yah screen ke neeche he- asal main K1 main ek in disple fingerprint scinar aata he, jisase tej or zyada sateek pradarshan miltaa he
 The bezels are minimal in this smartphone and hence you get a good display
 is divaais kaa screen tu body reshyo 91 fisadi he
 On turning the phone, you will be surprised to see its 3D body
 K1 phone do rangon main uplabdh he: estral blue or piano blike
 But due to the effect of the lights on the back body of the mobile, you will be surprised to see its changing shade

 This combination of light and shadow shows a variety of shades and colors, giving the phone its own unique glow
 itani zyada chamak kii vajah se hi K1 phone ek gahane kii tarah dikhataa he, haalanki yah itnaa najuk bhi nahin he
 Its front has Corning Gorilla Glass 5 and because of this, the confidence of the phone being solid solidifies
 iske chamatkrit karne vaale dizin or thos banaavat ke andar kaaphi achche hardware bhi hai
 Its display is full HD + AMOLED and gives strength to this device is its Snapdragon 660 processor, whose performance needs no proof
 snapadragon 660 procesar jab 4 jibi ram or 64 jibi kii internal storage (jise micro esady card ke jariye badha bhi sakate hai) ke saath aata he, to gaming se lekar multi tasking tak main yah smartphone shandaar kaam karata he

 We have not yet discussed cameras
 to OPPO kii sarvshereshth parampara ke mutabik hi ye asaadhaaran hai
 The brand has made the selfie vibrant and accurate, the K1 has a camera that redefines the experience of shooting selfies
 isamen ek jabardast 25 megapixl kaa f / 2
 There is a camera with 0 aperture, which gives a very good picture
 rear camera bhi koi kam nahin he
 The OPPO K1 has two rear cameras
 isamen se main camera 16 megapixl or bade f / 1
 Another camera with 75 aperture and 2 mega pixels deep sensor
 apane front phase vaale rishtedaar kii tarah ye camere bhi kaaphi samajhadaar hai- ve kaaphi samajhadaari se 16 seen or 120 seen ke combination ko pahchaan sakate hai or uske mutabik rangon main pherbadal kar sakate hai taaki aapaki tasviir zyada sajiv or chatak dikhe
 In these, AI also looks amazing in portrait mode, which enables the camera to take pictures with bokeh
 ye tasviren jabardast to hoti hi hai, aswabhaavik bhi nahin dikhti
 Result? You get such rich pictures, which not only have better colors, but also their closeness
 nishchit rup se, in sabake liye kaaphi power kii jarurat hoti he or isliye OPPO K1 main badi 3600 mah kii bydaree di gai he, jo ki aapke divaais ko aasaani se din bhar saamaanya se lekar zyada tak istemaal main sakasham banaati he
 One of the reasons for the battery's extraordinarily long life is also the fact that OPPO K1's software is optimized for it
 yah phone android 8

 2 diya gaya he
 This not only ensures that you can get a smooth and rich feature on the device, but it also comes with special features like Smart Assistant and Smart Sidebar, which enable you to do more than normal on the phone

 yah phone flipcart par 12 farvari se uplabdh hoga
 Not only this, for the first time OPPO smartphone has been made available for eight months with a 90 percent buyback value, and the bank discount is separately
 iskaa matlab yah he ki upabhokta ke liye bybech avadhi main OPPO K1 kii prabhavi laagat lagbhag shunya ho jaaegi
 Thus, the price of OPPO K1 is Rs 16,990, but it will be available for eight months for an additional bank discount of Rs 1,690 and up to Rs 15,300 with 90% buyback value
 to kul milakar yah kaha ja saktaa he ki K1 ke saath oppo ne logon ke bank acount main zyada cat lagaae bina unhen ucch stareey pradarshan muhaiyaa kiya he

 My circumstances were bad until four years before the release of my film Shootout at Wadala
 film industry ke 90 pratishat log mere saath kaam nahin karnaa chaahate the kyonki meraa sanju ke saath manmutav ho gaya tha
 However, the director also said that Sanjay Dutt never directly told people not to work with Sanjay Gupta, but people living around Sanju asked him not to join the project with Gupta
 unhone is bare main baat karte hue kaha ki 'wo mere liye bahut bura daur tha
 i almost gave up
 maine khandala main ek hotel main kaam karnaa shuru kar diya tha or main vahaan hafte main chaar din jane laga tha
 i thought this is my future because i am not going to get work in the industry anymore
 'view this post on instagramremember the famous # Kaante walk? Well, here is the scene from LA, where the film was shot: Kumar Gaurav, Sanjay Dutt, Suneil Shetty, Amitabh Bachchan, I, Mahesh Manjrekar and Lucky Ali— apart from me, the incredible cast of the film
 One of our most talked about productions
 People still ask me when we will make # Kaante2

 unhone kaha ki main apane bete ko haathon main uthaakar soch rahaa tha ki main iske liye aakhir kya chhodkar jane vaala hum? aakhir main kab se nakaaratmak or haare hue logon kii tarah bartaav karne laga
 i started working at the age of 15

 He then met John Abraham and Anil Kapoor
 haalanki in sitaron ko ye bhi kaha gaya tha ki ve sanjay gupta ke saath kaam naa karen lekin anil kapur ne is maamle main sanjay gupta kaa samarthan karte hue kaha tha ki agar sanju mujhe sidhe taur par kahegaa ki main sanjay gupta ke saath kaam naa karun to main nahin karuunga
 Sanjay Gupta praised Anil Kapoor's support
 saal 2015 main sanjay gupta ke set par sanjay dutt khaastaur par milane ke liye aae the or sanjay gupta ne khushi main twit karte hue kaha tha ki sanju unke set par 8 saalon baad kadam rakh rahe hai jise unhone shandaar feeling bataaya tha
 Things are normal now between Sanjay Dutt and Sanjay Gupta and Sanjay and Sanju are seen together after a long time in the film Mumbai Saga
 sanjay gupta kii film mumbai saaga main pratik babbar, jaiki shroff, rohit gupta, amol gupte, sunil shetty, jon abraham, sanjay dutt jaise sitare nazar aaenge
 Congress President Sonia Gandhi has broken the silence on receiving a notice from the Income Tax Department in the National Herald case
 unhone kaha, 'hamen inakam tex kaa notice mila he
 Action has been taken under this political vendetta
 ham or majboot hokar satta main aaenge
 BJP leaders, on the other hand, have termed Sonia Gandhi's statement as false
 nalin kohli ne kaha ki bijepi kisi tarah kii raajnneetik or badale kii karrwai main vishwaas nahin rakhti he
 The party believes in the law and the law will do its job
 agar unhone koi galat kaam nahin kiya he, to phir unhen nahin darana chahie
 Kohli said that if he used public funds, he would have to answer

 In this, this loan was given to Young India Trust
 neshnal herald samachar patr se jude isi maamle main inakam tex ne congress adhyaksh ko notice bheja he
 Earlier, the Delhi court issued summons to Congress President Sonia Gandhi and Vice President Rahul Gandhi and asked them to appear before the court before August 7

 The summons has been issued on a personal complaint by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Subramanian Swamy

 Deep Kalrasal year after year when the media reports about the best business schools in India, he holds his breath and tells us about the salary packages and placements of the top institutions of the country
 mujhe andeh he ki aane vaale dinon main isamen koi badlaav aayega
 After all, for those who want to break through economic barriers by getting big-paying corporate jobs, this is a natural reason to be happy and celebrate — an academic institution from which top business executives leave and then risk their ability around the world Huh
 bharat ke bahuterey bi-skool main bhartiya prabandhan santhaan, ahmedabad (yaa iiem-e), sidhe-sade shabdon main kahen to management shiksha ke bilkul shikhar par he
 The institute's worldwide reputation is further strengthened by the presence of well-known companies during the placement season and is selected from among its graduate students
 haalanki yah haal hi kaa rujhaan he—mujhe vah vakt ab bhi yaad he jab haroonges selary package bi-skool ke placement abhiyaanon main aam baat nahin hua karte the
 For example, Sanjeev Bhikchandani, founder of Info Edge (which owns job portal Naukri
com) tells me that when he graduated from IIMA in 1989, not many companies come to campus to recruit graduate students
 Were
 alabatta 1992 aate-aate halaat kaaphi kuch vaise ho chale the jaise aaj hai
 By then, consulting firms and FMCG (fast moving consumer goods) companies started coming to campus and that year mckinsey, a world-renowned consulting firm, had two graduates from here and made such recruitments for the first time from any Indian business school
 
 alabatta jaani-maani companiyon main placement or uske saath milane vaali moti tankhwaah ke sankeern nazariye se aage iiem-e ko apane behad kaabil prophessoron, shandaar samakaksh logon ke samoohon (pier grups) or santhaan kii bahuaiami shiksha kii vajah se sarvshereshth main bhi sarvshereshth mana jaataa he
 The education available here makes students for life
 iiem-e sareekhe santhaan apni is buniyadi utkrushtataa kii vajah se hi ateet main bhi atyadhik sammaan hasil karte the—sabase achche sansthaanon se ucch shiksha hasil karnaa apane aap main ek visheshadhikaar he
 i enrolled at St
 Stephens for a bachelor's degree and studied economics
 puure satr ke dauraan maine zyada haath-pair nahin maare lekin mere man main pakkaa tha ki uske baad mujhe kya karnaa he
 The path to a corporate career through one of the Indian Institutes of Management seemed to be the most natural option (it is a different matter that i decided not to stay in the corporate career for very long and tried my hand at my own venture after a few years of job )
 saint stephens se grajuation karne ke baad maine iiem, exelarai or ethemes main aavedan kiya
 Calling interviews from all the B-schools i had applied to was an encouraging thing, but when i got admission at IIM Ahmedabad, i felt that my hard work really paid off
 jab aap desh ke behtareen bi-skool main daakhila lene main kaamyaab ho jate hai, to shuruyaat main aapako lagata he ki aap koi turram khan hai
 But soon you start to realize that even though you have been a big fish in your small pond, but when you come in the vast sea, you are really happy and you are of no importance
 pehle manek (management acounting) quij ne ek jatke main mujhe jameen par patake diya
 This was the only major defeat of my life
 main behad dukhi isliye tha kyonki aise number mujhe pehle kabhi mili nahin the
 i knew that the time had come to gear up
 bahut jaldi hi mujhe apni li mil gai
 One of the extraordinary aspects of studying at IIMA is that you get to learn from the most brilliant professors — professors who think broadly and sharply at you, to identify and define problems accurately and Emphasize to solve them in a systematic and consistent manner
 mujhe professor e
 K
 jain se padhuya yaad he, jo bemisaal shikshak rahe hai or iiem-e graduate ke 40 baichon ko padhaa chuke hai
 He motivated us not to compromise on anything less than an accurate analysis of every fact and figure we encountered
 hamamen se jin logon ne unke saath cese charchaaen kii hai or kaksha main prajentation dene ke liye bulaae gaye hai, ve kabhi bhul nahin sakate ki kis tarah ve 'kyon' or 'to kya' kii jhadi laga dete the or sahi jawaab kii khoj ke liye hamaare upar athak jor daalate the
 Whatever comfortable delusions have been on our mind about being among the smartest educated students in the country, they quickly became familiar with the moment when we found ourselves surrounded by their investigative questions
 hamen yah seekhney main bahut vakt laga ki sahi jawaab khojane ke liye aapako pehle sahi sawaal poochna hota he
 It also taught us two lessons of humility
 iiem-e desh ke un awwal sansthaanon main se ek he jinhone prabandhan ke siddhanton ko seekhney ke liye cese study ke navonmeshi tareeke ko sabase pehle apanaaya
 This is an example of the institute's focus on applied learning
 cese study ke tareeke se na keval chaatr or shikshak ke bich judaav badhata he balki yah chaatro ke bich aapas main bhi zyada baatcheet or samvaad ko protsaahit karata he, jo sahabhaagi shiksha or samooh main kaam karne kii aadat kii ore le jaataa he
 This innovative effort at IIMA has come from working closely with Harvard Business School and has become the way of life for teachers and students here today
 desh ke kuch sabase medhaavi or pratibhashali vyaktiyon, behad pratispardhi maahaul or avishsaneey shiksha se ghira hona jahaan bhay or shraddha upjaata he, vahiin apni duusari abhiruchiyon ko bhi puraa karne kii chaatro kii kshamta dekhakar hairaani ho sakati he
 Despite the extremely rigorous tasks associated with the curriculum, IIM-A provides opportunities for numerous extra-curricular activities — sports, debate, informal interaction with faculty and more — to help students develop an all-round personality
 iskaa purana campus prasiddh lui kaan ke vaastushilp kii shuruaati alankrita style main—puri tarah laal eenton se—gadha gaya he or grey cement se bana nayaa campus ab use sangat de rahaa he
 However, they remain attractive to both students and visitors alike
 jo baat santhaan ko or bhi zyada ullekhneey banaati he, vah he iskaa atyaadhunik buniyadi dhaancha or bhavishya ke liye taiyaar paathyakram, jo yah aagaamee kal ke netritvkartaaon ko taiyaar karne ke liye prastut karata he
 It can only be called a paradigm shift that IIMA provided a course of entrepreneurship in the 1990s, which i chose at the time
 apni jindagi main baad main kahin jaakar maine janaa ki main korporate jivan bitaane ke bajaae apane dam par kuch na kuch apana nirmaan karnaa chahta tha
 After doing my MBA i worked for some time at ABA Amro and then GE Money
 magar nijee uplabdhi ke ehsaas kaa abhaav mujhe bheetar hi bheetar kutartaa rahata tha or main kuch zyada karne ke liye chatapata rahaa tha
 i had found the worm of the Internet and i believed that the way the Internet was democratizing information in an unimaginable manner till then, a big and meaningful change in normal functioning is going to take place
 shuruyaat mumbai ke mal main ek venture capitalist ke saath mulaakaat se hui—hamane utsaah ke saath ek paper napkin par nae kaarobaar kii yojana likhi or baaki itihaas he
 i am happy to say that this institute is preparing more entrepreneurs today than ever before
 kuch chaatr to apane dam par apana kuch shuru karne ke liye placement main shaamil tak nahin hote—ve bahut chota-sa hissaa ho sakate hai, par shuruyaat to ho rahi he
 At the time when i decided to give up my corporate job to start my own business, i was one of the handful of IIM-A people who chose a different route
 phir aise bhi purv chaatr hai jo saamaajik udhyami banane kaa rasta chun rahe hai or is dharna ko chunauti de rahe hai ki bijness skulon se keval capitalist leader hi banakar nikalate hai
 Organizations like Give India, which provide funding to certified non-profit donors; In India, alumni of IIMA, a charity organization like Microlanding's innovative organization Basics or Prayas, have been established and run by them
 duniya ke behtareen bijness skulon ke saath milakar kaam karne, research main gahari bhagidaari, nobel puraskaar vijetaon sahit jane-maane adhyetaon ke campus main aane ke saath or nawachaari incubeshan tathaa udhyamshiltaa centre ke taur par iiem-e vishwa stareey shiksha kii badalati jaruraton ke saath kadamtal kar rahaa he
 As an alumnus, it is difficult for me to be free from prejudice, but being in touch with the network of this institute, its teachers and alumni, i am very hopeful about the future of IIMA

 *** 500-1000 rupee ke note band hone se desh kii janata to pareshaan he hi, bharat main rahane vaale videshi rajanyik or videsh main bhartiya mudra istemaal karne vaale bhi kaasi mushkil main hai
 In this regard, the Ministry of External Affairs has received mainly three-four types of complaints
 pehali shikaayat dilli main rahane vaale videshi rajanyikon kii taraf se mili he
 He says that the embassy or high commission needs more cash
 noton kii nikasi or badale jane kii philhal jo seemaa rakhi gai he, vah inke liye paryaapt nahin he
 Their second complaint is that what will happen to the old notes they have taken as counselor and visa fees
 unhen kaise jamaa kiya jayega yaa phir ve kaise badale jaaenge
 The Dean of Diplomatic Corps met the officials of the Ministry of External Affairs and informed them about these problems
 bharat main rahane vaale rajanyikon ke alaava shikaayat non resident indian (enarai) kii taraf se bhi ai he jinke paas videsh main bhartiya mudra he
 However, more than a limit, Indian currency cannot be taken abroad
 lekin jinke paas tay seemaa main mudra he or ve philhal bharat nahin aa rahe to aise main unke 500-1000 ke noton kaa kya hoga
 How will they get new notes instead of old ones
 is tarah ke sawaal videsh mantralay se puche ja rahe hai
 The third complaint came from the Association of Indian Currency Converters in Outside Countries
 duniya ke duusare deshon kii karency ke badale bhartiya rupaya dene vaale agent ab bade noton kaa kya karenge
 The comments ek badi pareshaani bharat aane vaale sailaaniyon kii bhi he
 Especially those who are coming to India for treatment have different needs
 unhen moti naqdi kii zarurat hoti he
 The Ministry of External Affairs has sent all these complaints and questions to the Finance Department
 vitt vibhaag ne is maamle main atirikt sachiv ke netritv main ek inter ministrial cameti bana di he
 a senior joint secretary of the Ministry of External Affairs is also included in this committee
 videsh mantralay kaa kahana he ki cameti ke faisle or usase dishanirdesh milane ke baad hi wo shikaayat or sawaal karne waalon ko jawaab de paaegaa
 The first complaint came from foreign diplomats living in Delhi
 unka kahana he ki duutavas yaa ucchayog ko zyaada naqdi kii zarurat hoti he
 The limit placed at the time of withdrawal and exchange of notes is not sufficient for them
 inaki duusari shikaayat ye he ki inhone counslar or visa fees ke taur par jo puraane note liye hai unka kya hoga
 How they will be deposited or how they will be changed
 diplomatic kor ke dean ne videsh mantralay ke adhikariyon se mulaaqaat kar in samasyaon kii jaankaree di
 Apart from diplomats residing in India, the complaint has also come from the Non Resident Indian (NRI) who holds Indian currency abroad
 haalanki ek seemaa se zyaada bhartiya mudra videsh nahin le jaayi ja sakati
 But those who have currency within the prescribed limit and they are not coming to India at present, then what will happen to their 500-1000 notes
 ve puraane noton ke badale nae note kaise paaenge
 Such questions are being asked from the Ministry of External Affairs
 teesri shikaayat baahar ke deshon main bhartiya mudra badalane vaale association kii taraf se ai he
 What will the agents of the Indian rupee give in exchange for the currency of other countries of the world? tippaniyan There is also a big problem of tourists coming to India
 khaas taur par jo ilaaj ke liye bharat aa rahe hai unki alag tarah kii zarurat he
 They require thick cash
 videsh mantralay ne in tamaam shikayaton or sawaalon ko vitt vibhaag ko bhej diya he
 The Finance Department has constituted an Inter Ministerial Committee under the leadership of Additional Secretary in this matter
 videsh mantralay ke ek varisht sanyukt sachiv bhi is cameti main shaamil hai
 The Ministry of External Affairs says that only after getting the decision of the committee and its guidelines, it will be able to answer the complaints and questions

 maalegaanv dhamaakon ke silsile main nasik kii adaalat ne sadhvi pragna, shyaam sahu or dilip ko 6 november tak police hiraasat main bhej diya he
 The talk of these three being associated with Hindu organizations is coming out
 yah pehali baar he jab kisi aatankwaadi ghatana main kisi sadhvi or hindu sanghathanon kaa haath hone kii baat uth rahi he
 Apart from the Malegaon blasts, they are also likely to be related to the blasts in Gujarat
 mumbai police kii anti tebrist squad inase gaharaai se poochtacha kar rahi he
 Sadhvi Pragya, arrested in connection with the Malegaon blasts, has been associated with several Hindu organizations and for the last few years she was running an organization of her own called Vande Mataram
 pragna mulat: madhya pradesh ke bhopal kii rahane vaali he
 For many years she was living in Surat, Gujarat
 shuruuaat main pragna bijepi ke chaatr sanghathan abivipi se judi rahi
 After this she remained in RSS for many years and 6 years ago she formed an organization named Vande Mataram
 apane is sanghathan kaa sanchaalan vah bhopal se karti thi
 All things related to Pragya have been disclosed by her father Chandrapal Singh and told that the motorcycle used in the Malegaon blast was in the name of Sadhvi
 haalanki sadhvi ke pita kaa kahana he ki chaar saal pehle yah motorcycle bech di gai thi
 There has been a strong reaction to the arrest of Sadhvi Pragya in connection with the Malegaon blast
 sadhvi kii giraftaar ke khilaaf indore main akhil bhartiya vidhyaarthee parishad ke kaaryakartaaon ne virodh pradarshan kiya
 They said that a conspiracy is being hatched to defame ABVP
 idhar, rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ne bhi in aaropon kii ninda kii he ki maalegaanv or modasa dhamaakon ke peeche hindu sanghathanon kaa haath he
 The RSS says that this is being done to divert attention from real criminals

 sansmaranyadon ke galiyarenasira sharmasahitya bharti, krishna nagar,dilli-51keemtah 300 ru
 In today's dynamic times, journalism is playing an important role in forging the nature and craft of literature, therefore, the latest experiences of everyday events and drawing energy and inspiration from them, the literary society seeks new corridors of progress and use of events- Looks like nasira sharma kii pustak 'yaadon ke galiyare' bhi sansmaran, yatra-sansmaran, reportaj evam swatantra lekh ityadi ke madhyam se kii gai aisi hi ek sarthak talash he
 Initially, the memoirs compiled in the book reveal that a kind of 'nostalgia' dominates the writer
 prakruti unki is abhinn jivan yatra kaa anupam ang he jisase vah nirantar urja evam pranavayu praapt karti hui aage kii ore prasthaan karti dikhti he
 Therefore, his memoir, travel-memoir, reading the article is like going through a film that has a dynamic empire from beginning to end
 yahi gatishiltaa is sankalan ko pathneey evam rochak banaati he
 The old fort of Jhansi, the green life of Betwa and the variegated beauty of Parijat in Barabanki, Lucknow, you do not even know when you were part of this flow through the magical 'sn' of Taj Mahal

 Since there is a simple acceptance of the same system itself, so it seems appropriate for the writer to comment sporadically on it
 mizo samaaj main auraton ke saath hone vaali badasluki evam ninsaphi ke prati lekhika kii gahari sahanubhuti vyakt hui he
 Similarly, being part of the academic campus at JNU Campus, the writer keeps evidence of the deteriorating environment and the polluting environment, and considers herself fortunate to be a part of it and praises freedom of thought there
 pustak ke antim hisse main lekhika ke swatantra lekh hai jinamein 'bharat kii akhandta evam rashtrabhasha' naamak apane pehle lekh main lekhika kii chintaa rashtrabhasha ke rup main hindi ko uskaa haq dilwane kii he jo aam rashtravaadi soch se hat kar he
 Also, there is an urge to separate language from religion, caste etc
 isi se judaa masalaa bhashaa ko shuddh banane or use anya bhashaaon ke dakhal se varjit karne kaa bhi he
 Therefore, they put a very practical aspect of the problem before us
 'pravasi bharatiyon kii vidambnaa' sheershak lekh main videsh main based bharatiyon ke apane samaaj evam samskruti se dur rahane kii samasyaayein evam dar hai to duusari samskritiyon se aadan-pradaan ke nae-nae avasar bhi hai
 The writer has given his views on both these aspects
 'bacchon kii duniya main bado kaa dakhal' lekh aadhunikeekaran ke kaaran bacchon kii duniya par pad rahe prabhaav kii vishleshnatmak vyakhya hi nahin karata varan paramparaagat evam lok-sahitya (daadi-nani kii kahaniyaan, kissa tota-maina) aadi kii jarurat ko bhi rekhaankit karata he
 At the same time, the authors are unhappy with the little interest of publishers in children's literature
 pustak ke antim bhaag main sankalit ek anya lekh 'main naatak likhnaa chaahati hum' main lekhika apane jivan kaa ek swapn pathak ke saath saajha karti hai
