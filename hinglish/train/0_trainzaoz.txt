 congress mahasachiv jyotiraditya sindhiya ne aaj yani buudhvaar ko apana padbhaar sambhaal liya
 At the Congress headquarters, Jyotiraditya Scindia duly performed his work by offering prayers
 jyotiraditya ko pashchimi upi kaa prabhaar diya gaya he
 The special thing is that his and Priyanka Gandhi's office will be in the same room
 priyanka gandhi ko purvi upi kaa prabharee mahasachiv banaaya gaya he
 However, earlier, only Priyanka Gandhi Vadra's name plate was put in the same room 
 magar ratorat usamen tabdili kii gai or usee kamare ke baahar jyotiraditya sindhiya kaa bhi nem plate lag gaya
 After the name plate was confirmed on Tuesday, it was confirmed that Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra will sit in the room next to the room of her brother and Congress President Rahul Gandhi at the party headquarters
 haalanki, tab tak yah spasht nahin tha ki jyotiraditya sindhiya kaa cameraa koun sa hoga
 But on Wednesday, another picture also came that Jyotiraditya Scindia will be in the room where Priyanka Gandhi will be
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki congress ne isse yah sandesh dene kii koshish kii he ki priyanka gandhi or jyotiraditya sindhiya donon kaa kad baraabar he or rahul gandhi kii bahan hone kaa priyanka ko koi laabh nahin diya ja rahaa he
 From the second picture, it is clear that both have equal responsibility for UP and both of them have equal stature in the party
 upi hi nahin, AICC main is kamare ko bhi priyanka gandhi wadra or jyotiraditya sindhiya ke bich baanta gaya he
 This change happened overnight
 kal sirf priyanka ke naam kii pattee lagi thi
 The political message is that both are equally important, none the less

 Every mother worries whether her child has eaten food or not
 
 
 use puraa poshan mil rahaa he yaa nahin
 
 
 But many times, due to too much care, there are some such mistakes which affect the health of the child
 ye ghatana kuch aisi he
 His child's custody was snatched from a couple in Milan, Italy, as he placed his child on a strict vegan diet
 vegan, matlab puri tarah shaakaahaar
 The child was one year old but due to diet, he was not getting full nutrition
 is vajah se ek saal ke us bachche kaa vajan teen maheene ke bachche jitna hi tha
 When her grandparents took the child to the hospital, doctors said that the weight of the child is only five kilograms
 jab bachche kaa blad test kiya gaya to pataa chalaa ki uske sharir main calcium kaa percent cervive karne ke liye jaruri percent se bhi kam he
 After this the child had to undergo heart surgery
 philhal to baccha thik ho rahaa he
 Heart surgery, however, was not done due to diet
 doctoron kaa maananaa he ki bachche ko ye samasya pehle se hi rahi hogi lekin sharir main calcium kii kami ke chalate ye bad gai
 Judge Ciro Cascone told an Italian newspaper, "it is very clear that the child was kept on strict vegan diet
" jis umr main bachche badhate hai unhen ek strict diet par rakhana sahi nahin
 Even the parents did not give the necessary supplements for complete nutrition to the child
 doctoron ke mutabik, agar aap bachche ko kisi cheez se dur rakhana chaahate hai to koi buraai nahin he
 But by doing this, he can complete the things he is not getting nutrition by giving him supplements
 haalanki ye koi pehla mauka nahin he jab vegan diet ko lekar sawaal uthe hai

 Tiwari's emphasis was that Congress workers should go ahead and face the challenge
 unhone kaha ki congress kaa jor dharmanirpekshata par rahaa he
 The Congress leader said that the spokespersons should not hesitate to express their views in this regard
 unhone party ke logon se kaha ki ve 'ranvijay' kii tarah kaam karen na ki 'ranchhod' kii tarah
 He called for fierce competition in the difficult situation 
 tiwari ne 2010 ke bihar vidhansabha chunaavon kaa udhaaharan diya, jab congress ko chaar siten hi mili thim or unhen 20 se bhi zyada news channelon par sawaalon kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 Tiwari said that the industry is presenting Modi using television channels
 tiwari kaa jor is baat par tha ki congress ke kaaryakartaaon ko aage badhkar chunauti kaa saamana karnaa chahie
 He said that the emphasis of Congress has been on secularism
 congress netaa ne kaha ki pravaktaaon ko is sambandh main apni baat kehane main sankoch nahin karnaa chahie
 He asked the party people to act like 'rannvijay' and not 'ranchhod'
 unhone kathin sthiti main chunauti kaa jamkar muqabla karne kaa aahvaan kiya
 Tiwari gave the example of the 2010 Bihar assembly elections, when the Congress had won only four seats and faced questions on more than 20 news channels
 unhone party ke logon se kaha ki ve 'ranvijay' kii tarah kaam karen na ki 'ranchhod' kii tarah
 He called for fierce competition in the difficult situation
 tiwari ne 2010 ke bihar vidhansabha chunaavon kaa udhaaharan diya, jab congress ko chaar siten hi mili thim or unhen 20 se bhi zyada news channelon par sawaalon kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha

 In fact, with the Congress manifesto and the 72,000 rupees given in Rahul Gandhi's dream project 'nyaya Yojana', Rocky Mittal has been embroiled in controversy by creating a new song that calls Rahul Gandhi and Congress a traitor
 haryana sarkaar main "ek or sudhaar" project ke diarector or haryana sarkaar ke publicity adwiser rocky mittal par virdohi partiyon ne chautarafa hamalaa karnaa shuru kar diya he
 From the Congress to the Indian National Lok Dal, the Election Commission has demanded Rocky Mittal's removal from this government post, accusing him of misusing his official position and mocking the Constitution
 darasal, apane is nae geet main rocky mittal ne congress menifesto main kashmir main dhara 370 or AFSPA ko lekar congress kii ore se kahi gai baton par tanj ksaa he
 In the lyrics, it has been said that Rahul Gandhi will take 72000 rupees from us but do not sell the country
 is geet main congress par desh luutane kaa aarope lagaate hue congress ko lutaa hua dhan waapas dene kii baat kahi gai he

 Despite taking a lot of steps, we have been able to reach number six
 yah is baat ko darshata he ki bhrashtachar or kaale dhan kaa jaal kitne vyapak rup se desh main bicha he
 Some sections of people have spread the disease of corruption due to their selfishness
 garibon ke haq ko nazarandaz kar ye khud falte-phoolate rahe hai
 Some people took full advantage of this by misusing the position

 xxrep 130 - My dear countrymen, diwali ke paavan parv kii samaapti nai aashaaen or nai khushiyon ke saath hui hongi
 Today i want to request something special from you all
 is vaarta main kuch gambhir vishay, kuch mahatvapurn nirnay aap se saajha karuunga
 You will note that when you entrusted us with responsibility in May 2014, then in the context of BRICS in the world economy, there was a general discussion that the letter "I" in BRICS, which is associated with India, people used to say in BRICS " i have ", he is rolling
 lagaataar 2 saal ke deshvyapee akaal ke baavjood bhi, pichley dhai varshon main sava sau karod deshavaasiyon ke sahyog se aaj bharat ne global iconami main ek “brit spot” arthath chamakta sitara ke rup main apni upastithi darj karai he
 It is not that we are making this claim, rather it is resonating with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank
 bahano-bhaaiyo, Our motto in this race of development has been "sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas"
 yah sarkaar garibon ko samarpit he or samarpit rahegi
 The main weapon of our fight against poverty has been the active participation of the poor in the economy and prosperity of the country, ie the empowerment of the poor, the empowerment of the poor
 is prayaas kii jhalak aap logon ko pradhanmantri jan dhan yojana, jan dhan se jan suraksha yojana, aarthik gatividhiyon ke liye pradhan mantri mudra rin yojana, dalit, adivasee or mahila udhyamiyon ke liye stand ap india, garibon ke ghar gas kaa chulhaa pahunchaane ke liye pradhan mantri ujjwala yojana, kisaanon kii aamadani surakshit karne ke liye pradhan mantri fasal beemaa yojana or pradhan mantri krishi sinchai yojana, unako apane kheton se sahi upaj paane ke liye Soil health card yojana or sahi upaj kaa sahi daam paane ke liye e-nam arthath rashtriya krishi bazaar yojana – in sab main ye saafe najar aata he ye sarkaar gaanv, garib or kisaan ko samarpit he
 My dear countrymen pichley dashakon main ham yah anubhav kar rahe hai ki desh main bhrashtachar or kaala dhan jaisi bimariyon ne apni jade jamaa leen hai or desh se garibi hataane main ye bhrashtachar, ye kala dhan, ye gorakh dhandhe sabase badi baadha hai
 On the one hand, we are at the forefront of the fast-growing countries in the world
 duusari taraf bhrashtachar kii global ranking main do saal pehle bharat kareeb-kareeb sauven number par tha
 Despite taking a lot of steps, we have been able to reach number six
 yah is baat ko darshata he ki bhrashtachar or kaale dhan kaa jaal kitne vyapak rup se desh main bicha he
 Some sections of people have spread the disease of corruption due to their selfishness
 garibon ke haq ko nazarandaz kar ye khud falte-phoolate rahe hai
 Some people took full advantage of this by misusing the position
 duusari taraf, imaanadaar logon ne iske khilaaf ladaai bhi ladi he
 Crores of citizens of the country have shown honesty by living
 ham praayah yah sunate hai kii garib auto dryver apni gadee main chhot gai sone ke aabhushan vaale bag ko uske asli maalik ko kaise dhund kar lautaata he, kai baar ham sunate hai koi taxi dryver yatriyon kaa koi saamaan agar chhot jaataa he, mobile phone rah jaataa he to apane kharche se unako dhughane jaataa he, or pahunchaa detaa he, are sabji bechney vaala bhi, saamaanya duukaan vaala bhi agar graahak se galati se zyada paise le liye to to usko bulaakar lautaa detaa he
 Dear countrymen, is baat kaa ye saboot he ki hindustan kaa saamaanya se saamaanya naagarik eemaandaar he, lekin pyaare deshavaasiyo, har desh ke vikaas ke itihaas main aise kshan aae hai jab ek shaktishaalee or nirnaayak kadam kii aavashyaktaa mahasoos kii gai
 This country has realized over the years that corruption, black money, fake notes and terrorism - are the cancers that push the country back in the race for development
 desh ko, samaaj ko andar hi andar khokhla kar dete hai
 My dear countrymen, aatankwaad kii bhayaanakta ko koun nahin jaanata he? kitne nirdosh logon ko maut ke ghat utaar diya jaataa he
 But have you thought from where the money is provided to these terrorists? Our enemies across the border run their business in India through counterfeit notes, counterfeit notes and this has been going on for years
 anek baar 500 or hajaar rupee ke jaali note kaa kaarobaar karne vaale pakade bhi gaye hai or ye note jabt bhi kiye gaye hai
 Brothers and sisters, ek taraf aatankwaad or jaali noton kaa jaal desh ko tabah kar rahaa he
 On the other hand, the challenge of corruption and black money remains before the country
 hamane kaary sanbhaalane ke turant baad bhrashtachar or kaale dhan ke khilaaf ladaai kii shuruyaat karte hue anek prabhavi kadam uthaae, jaise: • Set up SIT headed by former Supreme Court judge to investigate black money
 • videshon main jamaa kaale dhan ke liye 2015 main majboot kanoon banane kaa hamane kaam kiya
 • We brought changes in tax agreements with various countries, new agreements to bring black money from abroad
 • america sahit vibhinn deshon ke saath soochna ke aadan pradaan, information exchange kaa praavdhaan kiya
 • Another strong law in August 2016 to curb benami property of corrupt people
 • is kanoon se ek bahut bade chor daravaaje ko band kar diya gaya
 • The plan to declare undeclared income in the country with penalty revealed a large amount of undeclared income
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyo, With all these efforts, in the last two and a half years, about 1
25 lakh crore rupees of black money has come out from the corrupt
 aise karodon bharatvasi jinke rag rag main eemaandaaree daudti he unka maananaa he ki bhrashtachar, kaale dhan, benami sampatti, jaali note or aatankwaad ke khilaaf ladaai nirnaayak honi chahie
 Who would be an honest citizen who does not have to suffer the news that crores of rupees are found in the officers' house under the bed, or in sacks from place to place? aaj desh kii mudravyavastha kaa haal yah he ki desh main kul sikkon or noton kii mulya main 500 or 1,000 rupee vaale noton kaa hissaa lagbhag 80 se 90 pratishat tak pahunch gaya he
 Excess circulation of cash in the country has a direct relation with corruption
 bhrashtachar se arjeet cash kaa kaarobaar mahangaai par bada asar paidaa karata he
 The poor have to bear the brunt of this
 iskaa sidhaa prabhaav garib or madhyam varg kii kharidne kii shakti par padataa he
 You will have your own experience, when buying a house or land, you will take some money from you in check and most of the money will be sought in cash
 eemaandaar vyakti ke liye kuch bhi khareednaa, ek madhyam varg ke vyakti ke liye ghar khareednaa ho, uske paas kala dhan nahin he to musiibat ho jaati he
 Due to this business of cash, there is a lot of artificial increase, artificial increase in the value of many services and goods like house, land, higher education and medicine
 bhrashtachar se jamaa kiya gaya dhan ho yaa kaala dhan ho, ye donon benami hawala kaarobaar ko bal dete hai
 And we know that hawala is also used by the terrorists in the purchase of arms
 chunaavon main kaale dhan ke prabhaav kii charchaa to varshon se ho rahi he
 Brothers and sisters, desh ko bhrashtachar or kaale dhan rupi dimak se mukt karaane ke liye ek or sakht kadam uthaanaa jaruri ho gaya he
 Today midnight i
e
 from 8 pm on November 8, 2016, currency notes of 500 rupees and 1,000 rupees currently issued will not be legal tender i
e
 these currencies will be invalid by law
 500 or 1,000 rupee ke puraane noton ke jariye len dein kii vyavastha aaj madhya raatri se uplabdh nahin hogi
 The old notes of 500 and 1,000 rupees present with the anti-national and anti-social elements involved in the business of corruption, black money and fake notes will now be left just like a piece of paper
 aise naagarik jo sampatti, mehnat or eemaandaaree se kama rahen hai, unke hiton kii or unke haq kii puri raksha kii jaaegi
 Keep in mind that 100 rupees, 50 rupees, 20 rupees, 10 rupees, 5 rupees, 2 rupees and 1 rupee notes and all coins are regular and can be used for transactions
 us par koi roak nahin he
 This step of ours is going to give strength to the fight against corruption, black money and fake currency in the country, the ordinary citizen who is fighting

 It was a cause of concern for the country that corruption and black money were considered an easy part of life
 yah soch aaj hamaare rajnatik, saamaajik, or prashasnic jivan ko dimak kii tarah khaae ja rahaa he
 No part of the governance system is untouched by this termite
 tippaniyan From time to time, we have seen that if the general public mind of India has to choose one of corruption and inconvenience for a few days, then it is unheard of, i say, it is the unflinching citizen of my country will choose the inconvenience, but never corruption Will choose aapse main phir ek baar aahvaan karata hum ki aaie jaise aapane diwali ke parv main apane ghar or aas pados kii safai kii, vaise hi safai ke kaam ko aage badhaate hue, ham is mahayajna main apni purnahuti daalkar ise safal banaaie
 In view of the inconvenience in the great cause of such a big cleanliness, in such a big country, let us all celebrate Diwali of purity, show this faithfulness of India to the whole world, celebrate the festival of authenticity in the whole country so that corruption can be curbed, To crack down on black money, to enable those who play the game of fake notes, so that the money of the country can be used for the poor, every honest citizen should be successful in the country's prosperity Could not get a fair share, future generations proud to live your life

 It was a cause of concern for the country that corruption and black money were considered an easy part of life

 No part of the governance system is untouched by this termite

 bahano-bhaaiyo, Our motto in this race of development has been "sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas"
 yah sarkaar garibon ko samarpit he or samarpit rahegi
 The main weapon of our fight against poverty has been the active participation of the poor in the economy and prosperity of the country, ie the empowerment of the poor, the empowerment of the poor
 is prayaas kii jhalak aap logon ko pradhanmantri jan dhan yojana, jan dhan se jan suraksha yojana, aarthik gatividhiyon ke liye pradhan mantri mudra rin yojana, dalit, adivasee or mahila udhyamiyon ke liye stand ap india, garibon ke ghar gas kaa chulhaa pahunchaane ke liye pradhan mantri ujjwala yojana, kisaanon kii aamadani surakshit karne ke liye pradhan mantri fasal beemaa yojana or pradhan mantri krishi sinchai yojana, unako apane kheton se sahi upaj paane ke liye Soil health card yojana or sahi upaj kaa sahi daam paane ke liye e-nam arthath rashtriya krishi bazaar yojana – in sab main ye saafe najar aata he ye sarkaar gaanv, garib or kisaan ko samarpit he
 My dear countrymen pichley dashakon main ham yah anubhav kar rahe hai ki desh main bhrashtachar or kaala dhan jaisi bimariyon ne apni jade jamaa leen hai or desh se garibi hataane main ye bhrashtachar, ye kala dhan, ye gorakh dhandhe sabase badi baadha hai
 On the one hand, we are at the forefront of the fast-growing countries in the world
 duusari taraf bhrashtachar kii global ranking main do saal pehle bharat kareeb-kareeb sauven number par tha
 Despite taking a lot of steps, we have been able to reach number six
 yah is baat ko darshata he ki bhrashtachar or kaale dhan kaa jaal kitne vyapak rup se desh main bicha he
 Some sections of people have spread the disease of corruption due to their selfishness
 garibon ke haq ko nazarandaz kar ye khud falte-phoolate rahe hai
 Some people took full advantage of this by misusing the position
 duusari taraf, imaanadaar logon ne iske khilaaf ladaai bhi ladi he
 Crores of citizens of the country have shown honesty by living
 ham praayah yah sunate hai kii garib auto dryver apni gadee main chhot gai sone ke aabhushan vaale bag ko uske asli maalik ko kaise dhund kar lautaata he, kai baar ham sunate hai koi taxi dryver yatriyon kaa koi saamaan agar chhot jaataa he, mobile phone rah jaataa he to apane kharche se unako dhughane jaataa he, or pahunchaa detaa he, are sabji bechney vaala bhi, saamaanya duukaan vaala bhi agar graahak se galati se zyada paise le liye to to usko bulaakar lautaa detaa he
 Dear countrymen, is baat kaa ye saboot he ki hindustan kaa saamaanya se saamaanya naagarik eemaandaar he, lekin pyaare deshavaasiyo, har desh ke vikaas ke itihaas main aise kshan aae hai jab ek shaktishaalee or nirnaayak kadam kii aavashyaktaa mahasoos kii gai
 This country has realized over the years that corruption, black money, fake notes and terrorism - are the cancers that push the country back in the race for development
 desh ko, samaaj ko andar hi andar khokhla kar dete hai
 My dear countrymen, aatankwaad kii bhayaanakta ko koun nahin jaanata he? kitne nirdosh logon ko maut ke ghat utaar diya jaataa he
 But have you thought from where the money is provided to these terrorists? Our enemies across the border run their business in India through counterfeit notes, counterfeit notes and this has been going on for years
 anek baar 500 or hajaar rupee ke jaali note kaa kaarobaar karne vaale pakade bhi gaye hai or ye note jabt bhi kiye gaye hai
 Brothers and sisters, ek taraf aatankwaad or jaali noton kaa jaal desh ko tabah kar rahaa he
 On the other hand, the challenge of corruption and black money remains before the country
 hamane kaary sanbhaalane ke turant baad bhrashtachar or kaale dhan ke khilaaf ladaai kii shuruyaat karte hue anek prabhavi kadam uthaae, jaise: • Set up SIT headed by former Supreme Court judge to investigate black money
 • videshon main jamaa kaale dhan ke liye 2015 main majboot kanoon banane kaa hamane kaam kiya
 • We brought changes in tax agreements with various countries, new agreements to bring black money from abroad
 • america sahit vibhinn deshon ke saath soochna ke aadan pradaan, information exchange kaa praavdhaan kiya
 • Another strong law in August 2016 to curb benami property of corrupt people
 • is kanoon se ek bahut bade chor daravaaje ko band kar diya gaya
 • The plan to declare undeclared income in the country with penalty revealed a large amount of undeclared income
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyo, With all these efforts, in the last two and a half years, about 1
25 lakh crore rupees of black money has come out from the corrupt
 aise karodon bharatvasi jinke rag rag main eemaandaaree daudti he unka maananaa he ki bhrashtachar, kaale dhan, benami sampatti, jaali note or aatankwaad ke khilaaf ladaai nirnaayak honi chahie
 Who would be an honest citizen who does not have to suffer the news that crores of rupees are found in the officers' house under the bed, or in sacks from place to place? aaj desh kii mudravyavastha kaa haal yah he ki desh main kul sikkon or noton kii mulya main 500 or 1,000 rupee vaale noton kaa hissaa lagbhag 80 se 90 pratishat tak pahunch gaya he
 Excess circulation of cash in the country has a direct relation with corruption
 bhrashtachar se arjeet cash kaa kaarobaar mahangaai par bada asar paidaa karata he
 The poor have to bear the brunt of this
 iskaa sidhaa prabhaav garib or madhyam varg kii kharidne kii shakti par padataa he
 You will have your own experience, when buying a house or land, you will take some money from you in check and most of the money will be sought in cash
 eemaandaar vyakti ke liye kuch bhi khareednaa, ek madhyam varg ke vyakti ke liye ghar khareednaa ho, uske paas kala dhan nahin he to musiibat ho jaati he
 Due to this business of cash, there is a lot of artificial increase, artificial increase in the value of many services and goods like house, land, higher education and medicine
 bhrashtachar se jamaa kiya gaya dhan ho yaa kaala dhan ho, ye donon benami hawala kaarobaar ko bal dete hai
 And we know that hawala is also used by the terrorists in the purchase of arms
 chunaavon main kaale dhan ke prabhaav kii charchaa to varshon se ho rahi he
 Brothers and sisters, desh ko bhrashtachar or kaale dhan rupi dimak se mukt karaane ke liye ek or sakht kadam uthaanaa jaruri ho gaya he
 Today midnight i

 Glimpses of this effort to bring you the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, Jan Dhan to Jan Suraksha Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Mudra Loan Yojana for economic activities, Stand Up India for Dalit, Adivasi and women entrepreneurs, gas stove for the poor Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana and Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana to secure farmers' income Soil health card scheme to get the right yield from this and e-nam ie National Agriculture Market Scheme for getting the right price for the right yield - this is clearly visible in all this government is dedicated to the village, the poor and the farmer
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyo In the last decades, we are realizing that diseases like corruption and black money have taken root in the country and this corruption, this art money, this Gorakh business are the biggest obstacles in removing poverty from the country
 ek taraf to vishwa main ham aarthik gati main teji se badhane vaale deshon main sabase aage hai
 On the other hand, in the global ranking of corruption two years ago, India was almost number one hundred
 dher saare kadam uthaane ke baavjood ham chhihattaraven number par pahunch paae hai
 This shows how widely the network of corruption and black money has been spread in the country
 bhrashtachar kii beemaari ko kuch varg vishesh ke logon ne apane swaarth ke kaaran failaa rakhaa he
 They themselves have thrived, ignoring the rights of the poor
 kuch logon ne pad kaa durupyog karte hue iskaa bharpoor phayda uthaaya
 On the other hand, sincere people have also fought against it
 desh ke karodon nagarikon ne eemaandaaree ko ji kar ke dikhaaya he
 We often hear about how a poor auto driver returns a bag of gold jewelery left in his car to its rightful owner, and many times we hear that a taxi driver will leave a baggage of passengers, a mobile phone
 If he goes, he goes to search for them with his expenses, and he delivers, hey, the seller of vegetables, even the general store, if he takes more money by mistake than the customer, then call him And returns
 pyaare deshavaasiyon, This is proof that the commonest citizen of India is honest, but dear countrymen, there have been moments in the history of development of every country when the need for a powerful and decisive step was felt
 is desh ne yah varshon se mahasoos kiya he ki bhrashtachar, kaala dhan, jaali note or aatankwaad - aise nasoor hai jo desh ko vikaas kii daud main peeche dhakelte hai
 They hollow out the country, the society inside itself
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyo, Who does not know the horrors of terrorism? How many innocent people are put to death
 lekin kya aapane sochaa he ki in aatankiyon ko paisa kahaan-kahaan se muhaiyaa hota he? seemaa paar ke hamaare shatru jaali noton ke jariye, nakli noton ke jariye apana dhandha bharat main chalaate hai or yah saalon se chal rahaa he
 Many times, traders of fake currency of 500 and thousand rupees have also been caught and these notes have also been confiscated
 bahano-bhaaiyo, On one side, the network of terrorism and counterfeit notes is destroying the country
 duusari ore bhrashtachar or kaale dhan kii chunauti desh ke saamne bani hui he
 We took several effective steps immediately after assuming the task, starting the fight against corruption and black money, such as: • kaale dhan kii jaanch ke liye supreme court ke purv jaj kii adhyakshata main SIT kaa gathan kiya
 • In 2015, we enacted a strong law for black money stashed abroad
 • kaale dhan ko videsh se laane ke liye vibhinn deshon ke saath tex samjhauton main hamane parivartan kiya, nae samjhaute kiye
 • Provided information exchange, information exchange with various countries including USA
 • bhrashtachariyon kii benami sampatti ko rokane ke liye agast 2016 main ek or majboot kanoon
 • This law closed a very large burglar door
 • desh main aghoshit aay ko penalty ke saath ghoshit karne kii yojana main kaaphi badi maatra main aghoshit aay ujagar hui
 My dear countrymen, in saare prayaason se, pichley dhai saalon main bhrashtachariyon se kareeb-kareeb sava lakh karod rupee kaa kaala dhan baahar aayaa he
 The crores of Indians whose honesty runs in their eyes believe that the fight against corruption, black money, benami property, fake currency and terrorism should be decisive
 koun eemaandaar nagirak aisa hoga jise afasaron ke ghar bistar ke neeche se, yaa jagah-jagah boriyon main karodon rupee paae jane kii khabar pidaa na hoti ho? Today, the condition of the country's currency is that the share of 500 and 1,000 rupee notes in the value of total coins and notes in the country has reached about 80 to 90 percent
 desh main cash kaa atyadhik cirkulation kaa ek sidhaa sambandh bhrashtachar se he
 The business of cash earned from corruption has a major impact on inflation
 isaki maar garibon ko jhelni padati he
 This directly affects the purchasing power of the poor and middle class
 aapkaa swayan kaa anubhav hoga, jab makaan yaa jameen kharidte vaqt aap se kuch dhan check main lenge or zyaadaatar dhanrashi cash main maangi jaati hogi
 Buying anything for an honest person, buying a house for a middle class person, if he does not have art money, then trouble comes
 cash ke is dhandhe ke kaaran makaan, jameen, ucch shiksha or chikitsa jaisi anek sevaaon or vastuon ke mulya main bahut zyada kritrim vruddhi hoti he, artificial increase hota he
 Whether it is money deposited by corruption or black money, both of them give strength to benami hawala business
 or ham jaanate hai ki hawala kaa upyog aatankiyon ne hathiyaar kii kharid farokht main bhi kiya he
 The impact of black money in elections has been discussed for years
 bahano-bhaaiyo, It has become necessary to take a more strict step to free the country from corruption and black money termites

 Despite all these arrangements, if our honest countrymen suffered, then experience shows that the common citizen of this country is never left behind to sacrifice and suffer for the good of the country
 jab main sunata hum ki koi garib vidhwaa LPG sabsidi chhodane main aage aati he, yah tyaag ek ritred skool teacher main bhi paaya jaataa he jab wo pension se svachh bharat kosh main yogadan dene ko aage aata he, jab ham ye sunate hai ki garib adivasee maa kaa bakrii bechakar shauchalay banane ke liye paise laga detii he, ek faujee kaa apane gaanv ko svachh gaanv banane ke liye sattaavan hazaar rupee kaa daan dene ke liye aage aata he
 i have seen that the common citizen of the country has only one desire that he is ready to do anything - just welfare of the country
 atah bhrashtachar, kaala dhan, jaali note or aatankwaad ke khilaaf jang main ham log thodi si kathinaayee vah bhi kuch dinon ke liye to jhel hi sakate hai
 i fully believe that every citizen of the country will stand together against corruption in this Mahayagya of purity
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyo, After the festival of Diwali, now in this festival of sincerity, in this festival of authenticity, you raise your hands high
 meraa puraa vishwaas he ki desh ke sabhi raajnneetik dal, rajnatik kaaryakarta, saamaajik or shaikshanik sansthaaen, media sahit samaaj ke sabhi varg se is mahaan kaary main sarkaar se bhi zyada bad chadh kar bhaag lenge, sakaaratmak bhoomika adaa karenge or is kaary ko safal bana kar hi rahenge
 My dear countrymen, ye baaten jab main aapke samaksh rakh rahaa hum, isi samay sarkaar ke alag-alag vibhaagon ko bhi jaankaree ho rahi he, bank ho, post offis ho, railway ho, aspataal ho, unke adhikariyon ko bhi is vishay kii isse pehle koi jaankaree nahin mili he
 Because confidentiality was very important in this work
 aisi sthiti main reserve bank, sabhi banks or post offis ko kam samay main bahut sari vyavastha kerani he
 There will be some time in this system
 isliye reserve bank ne yah faisla liya he ki 9 navambar ko sabhi bank public kaary ke liye band rahenge
 Citizens will be inconvenienced
 meraa puraa bharosa he ki bank or post offis main kaam karne vaale sabhi saathi desh hit main is pavitra kaary ko safaltaapurvak paripurna karenge
 In the past, they have shown this by doing this
 meraa janata-janardan se itnaa hi aagrah he ki sabhi naagarik dhairya rakhte hue sabhi banks or post offis adhikariyon ke saath sahyog karen, yahi meri unase aagrah or binati he
 Sisters and brothers, samay-samay par mudravyavastha ko dhyaan main rakhkar reserve bank, centre sarkaar kii sahmati se nae adhik mulya ke note ko cirkulation main laata rahaa he
 In 2014, the Reserve Bank sent a proposal for a currency note of 5,000 and 10,000 rupees to the government, which was rejected by our government after deliberations
 ab is puri prakriya main reserve bank dwaara 2,000 rupee ke nae note ke prastaav ko sweekaar kiya gaya he
 The completely redesigned 500 rupees and new rupee notes of 2,000 rupees will now be brought in circulation
 reserve bank apane pichley anubhavon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue, karency cirkulation main adhik mulya ke noton kaa hissaa ab ek seemaa ke andar hi rahe iske liye reserve bank aavashyak prabandh karegaa
 Finally my dear countrymen main yah doharaana chahta hum ki kisi desh ke itihaas main aise kshan aate hai jab har vyakti yah mahasoos karata he ki use bhi us kshan kaa hissaa bananaa he
 He too has to contribute in the national interest, in nation building
 parantu aise kshan har kisi kii jindagi main gine chune hi aate hai
 Today, time is again giving us an opportunity
 har saamaanya naagarik bhrashtachar, kaala dhan, jaali note ke khilaaf is mahayajna main , is ladaai main apana yogadan de saktaa he
 Brothers and brothers, the more cooperation you get in this process, the more successful the purification will be
 desh ke liye yah chintaa kaa kaaran tha ki bhrashtachar or kaale dhan ko jivan kaa ek sahaj hissaa maan liya gaya tha
 This thinking is eating our political, social, and administrative life like a termite
 shashan vyavastha kaa koi bhi ang is dimak se achoota nahin he
 The comments samay-samay par hamane dekha he ki bharat ke saamaanya jan maanas ko agar bhrashtachar or kuch dinon kii asuvidha main se ek ko chunanaa ho, to vah behichak, main kahata hum behichak mere desh kaa eemaandaar naagarik asuvidha ko to chunegaa lekin bhrashtachar ko kadaapi nahin chunegaa
 i once again call upon you that, as you have cleaned your house and neighborhood in the festival of Diwali, in the same way, we can make it successful by putting our full sacrifice in this Mahayagya
 itane bade desh main, itani badi safai ke mahaparv main asuvidha ko dhyaan main na rakhte hue aaie sabhi shuchita kii diwali manaaen, puure vishwa ko bharat kii is eemaandaaree kaa utsav dikhaaen, puure desh main pramanikta kaa parv manaaen jisase bhrashtachar par lagaam lag sake, kaale dhan par nakel kas sake, jaali noton kaa khel khilne waalon ko nestnabud kar sake, jisase ki desh kaa dhan garibon ke kaam aa sake, har eemaandaar naagarik ko desh kii sampannataa main uski uchit hissedari mil sake, aane vaali peedi garv se apana jivan ji sake
 i want to take this fight against corruption further with the help of 125 crore countrymen with full confidence for your cooperation
 mujhe vishwaas he aapkaa saath, aapkaa sahyog aane vaali pidiyon ke liye prerak banegaa
 i once again express my heartfelt gratitude to you
 bharat mata kii jai
 My dear countrymen pichley dashakon main ham yah anubhav kar rahe hai ki desh main bhrashtachar or kaala dhan jaisi bimariyon ne apni jade jamaa leen hai or desh se garibi hataane main ye bhrashtachar, ye kala dhan, ye gorakh dhandhe sabase badi baadha hai
 On the one hand, we are at the forefront of the fast-growing countries in the world
 duusari taraf bhrashtachar kii global ranking main do saal pehle bharat kareeb-kareeb sauven number par tha
 Despite taking a lot of steps, we have been able to reach number six
 yah is baat ko darshata he ki bhrashtachar or kaale dhan kaa jaal kitne vyapak rup se desh main bicha he
 Some sections of people have spread the disease of corruption due to their selfishness
 garibon ke haq ko nazarandaz kar ye khud falte-phoolate rahe hai
 Some people took full advantage of this by misusing the position
 duusari taraf, imaanadaar logon ne iske khilaaf ladaai bhi ladi he
 Crores of citizens of the country have shown honesty by living
 ham praayah yah sunate hai kii garib auto dryver apni gadee main chhot gai sone ke aabhushan vaale bag ko uske asli maalik ko kaise dhund kar lautaata he, kai baar ham sunate hai koi taxi dryver yatriyon kaa koi saamaan agar chhot jaataa he, mobile phone rah jaataa he to apane kharche se unako dhughane jaataa he, or pahunchaa detaa he, are sabji bechney vaala bhi, saamaanya duukaan vaala bhi agar graahak se galati se zyada paise le liye to to usko bulaakar lautaa detaa he
 Dear countrymen, is baat kaa ye saboot he ki hindustan kaa saamaanya se saamaanya naagarik eemaandaar he, lekin pyaare deshavaasiyo, har desh ke vikaas ke itihaas main aise kshan aae hai jab ek shaktishaalee or nirnaayak kadam kii aavashyaktaa mahasoos kii gai
 This country has realized over the years that corruption, black money, fake notes and terrorism - are the cancers that push the country back in the race for development
 desh ko, samaaj ko andar hi andar khokhla kar dete hai
 My dear countrymen, aatankwaad kii bhayaanakta ko koun nahin jaanata he? kitne nirdosh logon ko maut ke ghat utaar diya jaataa he
 But have you thought from where the money is provided to these terrorists? Our enemies across the border run their business in India through counterfeit notes, counterfeit notes and this has been going on for years
 anek baar 500 or hajaar rupee ke jaali note kaa kaarobaar karne vaale pakade bhi gaye hai or ye note jabt bhi kiye gaye hai
 Brothers and sisters, ek taraf aatankwaad or jaali noton kaa jaal desh ko tabah kar rahaa he
 On the other hand, the challenge of corruption and black money remains before the country
 hamane kaary sanbhaalane ke turant baad bhrashtachar or kaale dhan ke khilaaf ladaai kii shuruyaat karte hue anek prabhavi kadam uthaae, jaise: • Set up SIT headed by former Supreme Court judge to investigate black money
 • videshon main jamaa kaale dhan ke liye 2015 main majboot kanoon banane kaa hamane kaam kiya
 • We brought changes in tax agreements with various countries, new agreements to bring black money from abroad
 • america sahit vibhinn deshon ke saath soochna ke aadan pradaan, information exchange kaa praavdhaan kiya
 • Another strong law in August 2016 to curb benami property of corrupt people
 • is kanoon se ek bahut bade chor daravaaje ko band kar diya gaya
 • The plan to declare undeclared income in the country with penalty revealed a large amount of undeclared income
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyo, With all these efforts, in the last two and a half years, about 1
25 lakh crore rupees of black money has come out from the corrupt
 aise karodon bharatvasi jinke rag rag main eemaandaaree daudti he unka maananaa he ki bhrashtachar, kaale dhan, benami sampatti, jaali note or aatankwaad ke khilaaf ladaai nirnaayak honi chahie
 Who would be an honest citizen who does not have to suffer the news that crores of rupees are found in the officers' house under the bed, or in sacks from place to place? aaj desh kii mudravyavastha kaa haal yah he ki desh main kul sikkon or noton kii mulya main 500 or 1,000 rupee vaale noton kaa hissaa lagbhag 80 se 90 pratishat tak pahunch gaya he
 Excess circulation of cash in the country has a direct relation with corruption
 bhrashtachar se arjeet cash kaa kaarobaar mahangaai par bada asar paidaa karata he
 The poor have to bear the brunt of this
 iskaa sidhaa prabhaav garib or madhyam varg kii kharidne kii shakti par padataa he
 You will have your own experience, when buying a house or land, you will take some money from you in check and most of the money will be sought in cash
 eemaandaar vyakti ke liye kuch bhi khareednaa, ek madhyam varg ke vyakti ke liye ghar khareednaa ho, uske paas kala dhan nahin he to musiibat ho jaati he
 Due to this business of cash, there is a lot of artificial increase, artificial increase in the value of many services and goods like house, land, higher education and medicine
 bhrashtachar se jamaa kiya gaya dhan ho yaa kaala dhan ho, ye donon benami hawala kaarobaar ko bal dete hai
 And we know that hawala is also used by the terrorists in the purchase of arms
 chunaavon main kaale dhan ke prabhaav kii charchaa to varshon se ho rahi he
 Brothers and sisters, desh ko bhrashtachar or kaale dhan rupi dimak se mukt karaane ke liye ek or sakht kadam uthaanaa jaruri ho gaya he
 Today midnight i
e
 from 8 pm on November 8, 2016, currency notes of 500 rupees and 1,000 rupees currently issued will not be legal tender i

 these currencies will be invalid by law
 500 or 1,000 rupee ke puraane noton ke jariye len dein kii vyavastha aaj madhya raatri se uplabdh nahin hogi
 The old notes of 500 and 1,000 rupees present with the anti-national and anti-social elements involved in the business of corruption, black money and fake notes will now be left just like a piece of paper
 aise naagarik jo sampatti, mehnat or eemaandaaree se kama rahen hai, unke hiton kii or unke haq kii puri raksha kii jaaegi

 This business will continue to run as before
 in saare intazaam ke baavjood hamaare eemaandaar deshavaasiyon ko agar takalif kaa saamana karnaa padaa to anubhav yah bataata he ki is desh kaa saamaanya naagarik desh kii bhalaai ke liye tyaag karne or kathinaayee sahane ke liye kabhi bhi peeche nahin rahata he
 When i hear that a poor widow comes forward to give up LPG subsidy, this sacrifice is also found in a retired school teacher when he comes forward to contribute to the Swachh Bharat Kosh from pension, when we hear that the poor tribals The mother's goat sells money to build toilets, a soldier comes forward to donate 57 thousand rupees to make his village a clean village
 maine to yah dekha he ki desh ke saamaanya naagarik kii ek hi tamanna he ki vah kuch bhi kar guzarane ko taiyaar he – bas desh kaa kalyaan ho
 Therefore, in the war against corruption, black money, counterfeit notes and terrorism, we can face some difficulty even for a few days

 Will continue to do it
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, When i am putting these things in front of you, at the same time, different departments of the government are also getting information, be it bank, post office, railway, hospital, even their officials have no information before this
 Is received
 kyonki is kaam main gopneeyata bahut hi aavashyak thi
 In such a situation, the Reserve Bank, all banks and post offices have to make a lot of arrangements in a short time
 is vyavastha main kuch samay to jayega
 Therefore, the Reserve Bank has decided that on 9 November all banks will remain closed for public works
 nagarikon ko asuvidha hogi
 i am confident that all the colleagues working in banks and post offices will successfully complete this sacred work in the interest of the country
 bhootkaal main unhone ye karke dikhaaya he
 i request the Janata Janardan so much that all citizens should be patient and cooperate with all banks and post office officers, this is my request and request
 bahano or bhaaiyo, From time to time, the Reserve Bank has been bringing in circulation of new high denomination notes with the consent of the Central Government
 2014 main reserve bank ne 5,000 or 10,000 rupee ke karency note kaa prastaav sarkaar ko bheja tha jise hamaari sarkaar ne vichaar-vimarsh ke baad asweekaar kar diya tha
 In this entire process, the proposal of a new note of Rs 2,000 has been accepted by the Reserve Bank
 puri tarah se nae taur par dijin kiye gaye 500 rupee or 2,000 rupee ke nae karency note ab cirkulation main laayaa jayega
 In view of the past experiences of the Reserve Bank, the Reserve Bank will make necessary arrangements to ensure that the denomination of high denomination notes is now within a limit
 ant main mere pyaare deshavaasiyo i want to reiterate that there are moments in the history of a country when every person realizes that they too have to be a part of that moment
 use bhi raashtra hit main, raashtra nirmaan main apana yogadan dena he
 But such moments only come to be counted in everyone's life
 aaj samay hamen phir se ek avasar de rahaa he
 Every ordinary citizen can contribute in this fight against corruption, black money, fake currency
 bahano or bhaaiyo aapse is prakriya main jitna sahyog milegaa, shuddhikaran utana hi safal hoga
 It was a cause of concern for the country that corruption and black money were considered an easy part of life
 yah soch aaj hamaare rajnatik, saamaajik, or prashasnic jivan ko dimak kii tarah khaae ja rahaa he
 No part of the governance system is untouched by this termite
 tippaniyan From time to time, we have seen that if the general public mind of India has to choose one of corruption and inconvenience for a few days, then it is unheard of, i say, it is the unflinching citizen of my country will choose the inconvenience, but never corruption Will choose aapse main phir ek baar aahvaan karata hum ki aaie jaise aapane diwali ke parv main apane ghar or aas pados kii safai kii, vaise hi safai ke kaam ko aage badhaate hue, ham is mahayajna main apni purnahuti daalkar ise safal banaaie
 In view of the inconvenience in the great cause of such a big cleanliness, in such a big country, let us all celebrate Diwali of purity, show this faithfulness of India to the whole world, celebrate the festival of authenticity in the whole country so that corruption can be curbed, To crack down on black money, to enable those who play the game of fake notes, so that the money of the country can be used for the poor, every honest citizen should be successful in the country's prosperity Could not get a fair share, future generations proud to live your life
 main aap sabake sahyog ke liye puure vishwaas ke saath sava sau karod deshavaasiyon ki madad se bhrashtachar ke khilaaf is ladaai ko or aage le janaa chahta hum
 i am sure your support, your cooperation will be inspiring for generations to come
 main phir ek baar aapkaa hriday se aabhaar vyakt karata hum
 Long live Mother India
 pichley dashakon main ham yah anubhav kar rahe hai ki desh main bhrashtachar or kaala dhan jaisi bimariyon ne apni jade jamaa leen hai or desh se garibi hataane main ye bhrashtachar, ye kala dhan, ye gorakh dhandhe sabase badi baadha hai
 On the one hand, we are at the forefront of the fast-growing countries in the world
 duusari taraf bhrashtachar kii global ranking main do saal pehle bharat kareeb-kareeb sauven number par tha
 Despite taking a lot of steps, we have been able to reach number six
 yah is baat ko darshata he ki bhrashtachar or kaale dhan kaa jaal kitne vyapak rup se desh main bicha he
 Some sections of people have spread the disease of corruption due to their selfishness
 garibon ke haq ko nazarandaz kar ye khud falte-phoolate rahe hai
 Some people took full advantage of this by misusing the position
 duusari taraf, imaanadaar logon ne iske khilaaf ladaai bhi ladi he
 Crores of citizens of the country have shown honesty by living
 ham praayah yah sunate hai kii garib auto dryver apni gadee main chhot gai sone ke aabhushan vaale bag ko uske asli maalik ko kaise dhund kar lautaata he, kai baar ham sunate hai koi taxi dryver yatriyon kaa koi saamaan agar chhot jaataa he, mobile phone rah jaataa he to apane kharche se unako dhughane jaataa he, or pahunchaa detaa he, are sabji bechney vaala bhi, saamaanya duukaan vaala bhi agar graahak se galati se zyada paise le liye to to usko bulaakar lautaa detaa he
 Dear countrymen, is baat kaa ye saboot he ki hindustan kaa saamaanya se saamaanya naagarik eemaandaar he, lekin pyaare deshavaasiyo, har desh ke vikaas ke itihaas main aise kshan aae hai jab ek shaktishaalee or nirnaayak kadam kii aavashyaktaa mahasoos kii gai
 This country has realized over the years that corruption, black money, fake notes and terrorism - are the cancers that push the country back in the race for development
 desh ko, samaaj ko andar hi andar khokhla kar dete hai
 My dear countrymen, aatankwaad kii bhayaanakta ko koun nahin jaanata he? kitne nirdosh logon ko maut ke ghat utaar diya jaataa he
 But have you thought from where the money is provided to these terrorists? Our enemies across the border run their business in India through counterfeit notes, counterfeit notes and this has been going on for years
 anek baar 500 or hajaar rupee ke jaali note kaa kaarobaar karne vaale pakade bhi gaye hai or ye note jabt bhi kiye gaye hai
 Brothers and sisters, ek taraf aatankwaad or jaali noton kaa jaal desh ko tabah kar rahaa he
 On the other hand, the challenge of corruption and black money remains before the country
 hamane kaary sanbhaalane ke turant baad bhrashtachar or kaale dhan ke khilaaf ladaai kii shuruyaat karte hue anek prabhavi kadam uthaae, jaise: • Set up SIT headed by former Supreme Court judge to investigate black money
 • videshon main jamaa kaale dhan ke liye 2015 main majboot kanoon banane kaa hamane kaam kiya
 • We brought changes in tax agreements with various countries, new agreements to bring black money from abroad
 • america sahit vibhinn deshon ke saath soochna ke aadan pradaan, information exchange kaa praavdhaan kiya
 • Another strong law in August 2016 to curb benami property of corrupt people
 • is kanoon se ek bahut bade chor daravaaje ko band kar diya gaya
 • The plan to declare undeclared income in the country with penalty revealed a large amount of undeclared income
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyo, With all these efforts, in the last two and a half years, about 1
25 lakh crore rupees of black money has come out from the corrupt
 aise karodon bharatvasi jinke rag rag main eemaandaaree daudti he unka maananaa he ki bhrashtachar, kaale dhan, benami sampatti, jaali note or aatankwaad ke khilaaf ladaai nirnaayak honi chahie
 Who would be an honest citizen who does not have to suffer the news that crores of rupees are found in the officers' house under the bed, or in sacks from place to place? aaj desh kii mudravyavastha kaa haal yah he ki desh main kul sikkon or noton kii mulya main 500 or 1,000 rupee vaale noton kaa hissaa lagbhag 80 se 90 pratishat tak pahunch gaya he
 Excess circulation of cash in the country has a direct relation with corruption
 bhrashtachar se arjeet cash kaa kaarobaar mahangaai par bada asar paidaa karata he
 The poor have to bear the brunt of this
 iskaa sidhaa prabhaav garib or madhyam varg kii kharidne kii shakti par padataa he
 You will have your own experience, when buying a house or land, you will take some money from you in check and most of the money will be sought in cash
 eemaandaar vyakti ke liye kuch bhi khareednaa, ek madhyam varg ke vyakti ke liye ghar khareednaa ho, uske paas kala dhan nahin he to musiibat ho jaati he
 Due to this business of cash, there is a lot of artificial increase, artificial increase in the value of many services and goods like house, land, higher education and medicine
 bhrashtachar se jamaa kiya gaya dhan ho yaa kaala dhan ho, ye donon benami hawala kaarobaar ko bal dete hai
 And we know that hawala is also used by the terrorists in the purchase of arms
 chunaavon main kaale dhan ke prabhaav kii charchaa to varshon se ho rahi he
 Brothers and sisters, desh ko bhrashtachar or kaale dhan rupi dimak se mukt karaane ke liye ek or sakht kadam uthaanaa jaruri ho gaya he
 Today midnight i
e
 from 8 pm on November 8, 2016, currency notes of 500 rupees and 1,000 rupees currently issued will not be legal tender i
e
 these currencies will be invalid by law
 500 or 1,000 rupee ke puraane noton ke jariye len dein kii vyavastha aaj madhya raatri se uplabdh nahin hogi
 The old notes of 500 and 1,000 rupees present with the anti-national and anti-social elements involved in the business of corruption, black money and fake notes will now be left just like a piece of paper
 aise naagarik jo sampatti, mehnat or eemaandaaree se kama rahen hai, unke hiton kii or unke haq kii puri raksha kii jaaegi
 Keep in mind that 100 rupees, 50 rupees, 20 rupees, 10 rupees, 5 rupees, 2 rupees and 1 rupee notes and all coins are regular and can be used for transactions
 us par koi roak nahin he
 This step of ours is going to give strength to the fight against corruption, black money and fake currency in the country, the ordinary citizen who is fighting

 Till 12 o'clock, some special arrangements have been made for the citizens

 This business will continue to run as before
 in saare intazaam ke baavjood hamaare eemaandaar deshavaasiyon ko agar takalif kaa saamana karnaa padaa to anubhav yah bataata he ki is desh kaa saamaanya naagarik desh kii bhalaai ke liye tyaag karne or kathinaayee sahane ke liye kabhi bhi peeche nahin rahata he
 When i hear that a poor widow comes forward to give up LPG subsidy, this sacrifice is also found in a retired school teacher when he comes forward to contribute to the Swachh Bharat Kosh from pension, when we hear that the poor tribals The mother's goat sells money to build toilets, a soldier comes forward to donate 57 thousand rupees to make his village a clean village
 maine to yah dekha he ki desh ke saamaanya naagarik kii ek hi tamanna he ki vah kuch bhi kar guzarane ko taiyaar he – bas desh kaa kalyaan ho
 Therefore, in the war against corruption, black money, counterfeit notes and terrorism, we can face some difficulty even for a few days
 meraa puraa vishwaas he ki desh kaa prayek naagarik bhrashtachar ke khilaaf shuchita ke is mahayajna main milakar khadaa hoga
 My dear countrymen, diwali ke parv ke baad, ab eemaandaaree ke is utsav main, pramanikta ke is parv main aap bad chadh kar haath bataaen

 Will continue to do it
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, When i am putting these things in front of you, at the same time, different departments of the government are also getting information, be it bank, post office, railway, hospital, even their officials have no information before this
 Is received

 In such a situation, the Reserve Bank, all banks and post offices have to make a lot of arrangements in a short time

 Therefore, the Reserve Bank has decided that on 9 November all banks will remain closed for public works
 nagarikon ko asuvidha hogi

 No part of the governance system is untouched by this termite
 tippaniyan From time to time, we have seen that if the general public mind of India has to choose one of corruption and inconvenience for a few days, then it is unheard of, i say, it is the unflinching citizen of my country will choose the inconvenience, but never corruption Will choose aapse main phir ek baar aahvaan karata hum ki aaie jaise aapane diwali ke parv main apane ghar or aas pados kii safai kii, vaise hi safai ke kaam ko aage badhaate hue, ham is mahayajna main apni purnahuti daalkar ise safal banaaie
 In view of the inconvenience in the great cause of such a big cleanliness, in such a big country, let us all celebrate Diwali of purity, show this faithfulness of India to the whole world, celebrate the festival of authenticity in the whole country so that corruption can be curbed, To crack down on black money, to enable those who play the game of fake notes, so that the money of the country can be used for the poor, every honest citizen should be successful in the country's prosperity Could not get a fair share, future generations proud to live your life

 main phir ek baar aapkaa hriday se aabhaar vyakt karata hum
 Long live Mother India
 ek taraf to vishwa main ham aarthik gati main teji se badhane vaale deshon main sabase aage hai
 On the other hand, in the global ranking of corruption two years ago, India was almost number one hundred
 dher saare kadam uthaane ke baavjood ham chhihattaraven number par pahunch paae hai
 This shows how widely the network of corruption and black money has been spread in the country
 bhrashtachar kii beemaari ko kuch varg vishesh ke logon ne apane swaarth ke kaaran failaa rakhaa he
 They themselves have thrived, ignoring the rights of the poor
 kuch logon ne pad kaa durupyog karte hue iskaa bharpoor phayda uthaaya
 On the other hand, sincere people have also fought against it
 desh ke karodon nagarikon ne eemaandaaree ko ji kar ke dikhaaya he
 We often hear about how a poor auto driver returns a bag of gold jewelery left in his car to its rightful owner, and many times we hear that a taxi driver will leave a baggage of passengers, a mobile phone
 If he goes, he goes to search for them with his expenses, and he delivers, hey, the seller of vegetables, even the general store, if he takes more money by mistake than the customer, then call him And returns
 pyaare deshavaasiyon, This is proof that the commonest citizen of India is honest, but dear countrymen, there have been moments in the history of development of every country when the need for a powerful and decisive step was felt
 is desh ne yah varshon se mahasoos kiya he ki bhrashtachar, kaala dhan, jaali note or aatankwaad - aise nasoor hai jo desh ko vikaas kii daud main peeche dhakelte hai
 They hollow out the country, the society inside itself
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyo, Who does not know the horrors of terrorism? How many innocent people are put to death
 lekin kya aapane sochaa he ki in aatankiyon ko paisa kahaan-kahaan se muhaiyaa hota he? seemaa paar ke hamaare shatru jaali noton ke jariye, nakli noton ke jariye apana dhandha bharat main chalaate hai or yah saalon se chal rahaa he
 Many times, traders of fake currency of 500 and thousand rupees have also been caught and these notes have also been confiscated
 bahano-bhaaiyo, On one side, the network of terrorism and counterfeit notes is destroying the country
 duusari ore bhrashtachar or kaale dhan kii chunauti desh ke saamne bani hui he
 We took several effective steps immediately after assuming the task, starting the fight against corruption and black money, such as: • kaale dhan kii jaanch ke liye supreme court ke purv jaj kii adhyakshata main SIT kaa gathan kiya
 • In 2015, we enacted a strong law for black money stashed abroad
 • kaale dhan ko videsh se laane ke liye vibhinn deshon ke saath tex samjhauton main hamane parivartan kiya, nae samjhaute kiye
 • Provided information exchange, information exchange with various countries including USA
 • bhrashtachariyon kii benami sampatti ko rokane ke liye agast 2016 main ek or majboot kanoon
 • This law closed a very large burglar door
 • desh main aghoshit aay ko penalty ke saath ghoshit karne kii yojana main kaaphi badi maatra main aghoshit aay ujagar hui
 My dear countrymen, in saare prayaason se, pichley dhai saalon main bhrashtachariyon se kareeb-kareeb sava lakh karod rupee kaa kaala dhan baahar aayaa he
 The crores of Indians whose honesty runs in their eyes believe that the fight against corruption, black money, benami property, fake currency and terrorism should be decisive
 koun eemaandaar nagirak aisa hoga jise afasaron ke ghar bistar ke neeche se, yaa jagah-jagah boriyon main karodon rupee paae jane kii khabar pidaa na hoti ho? Today, the condition of the country's currency is that the share of 500 and 1,000 rupee notes in the value of total coins and notes in the country has reached about 80 to 90 percent
 desh main cash kaa atyadhik cirkulation kaa ek sidhaa sambandh bhrashtachar se he
 The business of cash earned from corruption has a major impact on inflation
 isaki maar garibon ko jhelni padati he
 This directly affects the purchasing power of the poor and middle class
 aapkaa swayan kaa anubhav hoga, jab makaan yaa jameen kharidte vaqt aap se kuch dhan check main lenge or zyaadaatar dhanrashi cash main maangi jaati hogi
 Buying anything for an honest person, buying a house for a middle class person, if he does not have art money, then trouble comes
 cash ke is dhandhe ke kaaran makaan, jameen, ucch shiksha or chikitsa jaisi anek sevaaon or vastuon ke mulya main bahut zyada kritrim vruddhi hoti he, artificial increase hota he
 Whether it is money deposited by corruption or black money, both of them give strength to benami hawala business
 or ham jaanate hai ki hawala kaa upyog aatankiyon ne hathiyaar kii kharid farokht main bhi kiya he
 The impact of black money in elections has been discussed for years
 bahano-bhaaiyo, It has become necessary to take a more strict step to free the country from corruption and black money termites
 aaj madhya raatri yani 8 navambar 2016 kii raatri 12 baje se vartmaan main jari 500 rupee or 1,000 rupee ke karency note legal tender nahin rahenge yani ye mudraaen kanuunan amaanya hongi
 Transaction through old notes of 500 and 1,000 rupees will not be available from midnight today
 bhrashtachar, kaale dhan or jaali note ke kaarobaar main lipt desh virdohi or samaaj virdohi tatwon ke paas maujuud 500 evam 1,000 rupee ke puraane note ab keval kaagaj ke ek tukade ke samaan rah jaaenge
 Such citizens who are earning from property, hard work and honesty, their interests and their rights will be fully protected
 dhyaan rahe ki 100 rupee, 50 rupee, 20 rupee, 10 rupee, 5 rupee, 2 rupee or 1 rupaya kaa note or sabhi sikke niyamit hai or len dein ke liye upyog ho sakate hai
 There is no restriction on that
 hamaara yah kadam desh main bhrashtachar, kaala dhan evam jaali note ke khilaaf ham jo ladaai lard rahe hai, saamaanya naagarik jo ladaai lard rahaa he, usko isse takat milane vaali he
 In these days, the countrymen have to face the least problem, for this we have made some arrangements

 Despite all these arrangements, if our honest countrymen suffered, then experience shows that the common citizen of this country is never left behind to sacrifice and suffer for the good of the country
 jab main sunata hum ki koi garib vidhwaa LPG sabsidi chhodane main aage aati he, yah tyaag ek ritred skool teacher main bhi paaya jaataa he jab wo pension se svachh bharat kosh main yogadan dene ko aage aata he, jab ham ye sunate hai ki garib adivasee maa kaa bakrii bechakar shauchalay banane ke liye paise laga detii he, ek faujee kaa apane gaanv ko svachh gaanv banane ke liye sattaavan hazaar rupee kaa daan dene ke liye aage aata he
 i have seen that the common citizen of the country has only one desire that he is ready to do anything - just welfare of the country
 atah bhrashtachar, kaala dhan, jaali note or aatankwaad ke khilaaf jang main ham log thodi si kathinaayee vah bhi kuch dinon ke liye to jhel hi sakate hai
 i fully believe that every citizen of the country will stand together against corruption in this Mahayagya of purity
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyo, After the festival of Diwali, now in this festival of sincerity, in this festival of authenticity, you raise your hands high
 meraa puraa vishwaas he ki desh ke sabhi raajnneetik dal, rajnatik kaaryakarta, saamaajik or shaikshanik sansthaaen, media sahit samaaj ke sabhi varg se is mahaan kaary main sarkaar se bhi zyada bad chadh kar bhaag lenge, sakaaratmak bhoomika adaa karenge or is kaary ko safal bana kar hi rahenge
 My dear countrymen, ye baaten jab main aapke samaksh rakh rahaa hum, isi samay sarkaar ke alag-alag vibhaagon ko bhi jaankaree ho rahi he, bank ho, post offis ho, railway ho, aspataal ho, unke adhikariyon ko bhi is vishay kii isse pehle koi jaankaree nahin mili he
 Because confidentiality was very important in this work
 aisi sthiti main reserve bank, sabhi banks or post offis ko kam samay main bahut sari vyavastha kerani he
 There will be some time in this system
 isliye reserve bank ne yah faisla liya he ki 9 navambar ko sabhi bank public kaary ke liye band rahenge
 Citizens will be inconvenienced
 meraa puraa bharosa he ki bank or post offis main kaam karne vaale sabhi saathi desh hit main is pavitra kaary ko safaltaapurvak paripurna karenge
 In the past, they have shown this by doing this
 meraa janata-janardan se itnaa hi aagrah he ki sabhi naagarik dhairya rakhte hue sabhi banks or post offis adhikariyon ke saath sahyog karen, yahi meri unase aagrah or binati he
 Sisters and brothers, samay-samay par mudravyavastha ko dhyaan main rakhkar reserve bank, centre sarkaar kii sahmati se nae adhik mulya ke note ko cirkulation main laata rahaa he
 In 2014, the Reserve Bank sent a proposal for a currency note of 5,000 and 10,000 rupees to the government, which was rejected by our government after deliberations
 ab is puri prakriya main reserve bank dwaara 2,000 rupee ke nae note ke prastaav ko sweekaar kiya gaya he
 The completely redesigned 500 rupees and new rupee notes of 2,000 rupees will now be brought in circulation
 reserve bank apane pichley anubhavon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue, karency cirkulation main adhik mulya ke noton kaa hissaa ab ek seemaa ke andar hi rahe iske liye reserve bank aavashyak prabandh karegaa
 Finally my dear countrymen main yah doharaana chahta hum ki kisi desh ke itihaas main aise kshan aate hai jab har vyakti yah mahasoos karata he ki use bhi us kshan kaa hissaa bananaa he
 He too has to contribute in the national interest, in nation building
 parantu aise kshan har kisi kii jindagi main gine chune hi aate hai
 Today, time is again giving us an opportunity
 har saamaanya naagarik bhrashtachar, kaala dhan, jaali note ke khilaaf is mahayajna main , is ladaai main apana yogadan de saktaa he
 Brothers and brothers, the more cooperation you get in this process, the more successful the purification will be
 desh ke liye yah chintaa kaa kaaran tha ki bhrashtachar or kaale dhan ko jivan kaa ek sahaj hissaa maan liya gaya tha
 This thinking is eating our political, social, and administrative life like a termite
 shashan vyavastha kaa koi bhi ang is dimak se achoota nahin he
 The comments samay-samay par hamane dekha he ki bharat ke saamaanya jan maanas ko agar bhrashtachar or kuch dinon kii asuvidha main se ek ko chunanaa ho, to vah behichak, main kahata hum behichak mere desh kaa eemaandaar naagarik asuvidha ko to chunegaa lekin bhrashtachar ko kadaapi nahin chunegaa
 i once again call upon you that, as you have cleaned your house and neighborhood in the festival of Diwali, in the same way, we can make it successful by putting our full sacrifice in this Mahayagya
 itane bade desh main, itani badi safai ke mahaparv main asuvidha ko dhyaan main na rakhte hue aaie sabhi shuchita kii diwali manaaen, puure vishwa ko bharat kii is eemaandaaree kaa utsav dikhaaen, puure desh main pramanikta kaa parv manaaen jisase bhrashtachar par lagaam lag sake, kaale dhan par nakel kas sake, jaali noton kaa khel khilne waalon ko nestnabud kar sake, jisase ki desh kaa dhan garibon ke kaam aa sake, har eemaandaar naagarik ko desh kii sampannataa main uski uchit hissedari mil sake, aane vaali peedi garv se apana jivan ji sake
 i want to take this fight against corruption further with the help of 125 crore countrymen with full confidence for your cooperation
 mujhe vishwaas he aapkaa saath, aapkaa sahyog aane vaali pidiyon ke liye prerak banegaa
 i once again express my heartfelt gratitude to you
 bharat mata kii jai
 Some sections of people have spread the disease of corruption due to their selfishness
 garibon ke haq ko nazarandaz kar ye khud falte-phoolate rahe hai
 Some people took full advantage of this by misusing the position
 duusari taraf, imaanadaar logon ne iske khilaaf ladaai bhi ladi he
 Crores of citizens of the country have shown honesty by living
 ham praayah yah sunate hai kii garib auto dryver apni gadee main chhot gai sone ke aabhushan vaale bag ko uske asli maalik ko kaise dhund kar lautaata he, kai baar ham sunate hai koi taxi dryver yatriyon kaa koi saamaan agar chhot jaataa he, mobile phone rah jaataa he to apane kharche se unako dhughane jaataa he, or pahunchaa detaa he, are sabji bechney vaala bhi, saamaanya duukaan vaala bhi agar graahak se galati se zyada paise le liye to to usko bulaakar lautaa detaa he
 Dear countrymen, is baat kaa ye saboot he ki hindustan kaa saamaanya se saamaanya naagarik eemaandaar he, lekin pyaare deshavaasiyo, har desh ke vikaas ke itihaas main aise kshan aae hai jab ek shaktishaalee or nirnaayak kadam kii aavashyaktaa mahasoos kii gai
 This country has realized over the years that corruption, black money, fake notes and terrorism - are the cancers that push the country back in the race for development
 desh ko, samaaj ko andar hi andar khokhla kar dete hai
 My dear countrymen, aatankwaad kii bhayaanakta ko koun nahin jaanata he? kitne nirdosh logon ko maut ke ghat utaar diya jaataa he
 But have you thought from where the money is provided to these terrorists? Our enemies across the border run their business in India through counterfeit notes, counterfeit notes and this has been going on for years
 anek baar 500 or hajaar rupee ke jaali note kaa kaarobaar karne vaale pakade bhi gaye hai or ye note jabt bhi kiye gaye hai
 Brothers and sisters, ek taraf aatankwaad or jaali noton kaa jaal desh ko tabah kar rahaa he
 On the other hand, the challenge of corruption and black money remains before the country
 hamane kaary sanbhaalane ke turant baad bhrashtachar or kaale dhan ke khilaaf ladaai kii shuruyaat karte hue anek prabhavi kadam uthaae, jaise: • Set up SIT headed by former Supreme Court judge to investigate black money
 • videshon main jamaa kaale dhan ke liye 2015 main majboot kanoon banane kaa hamane kaam kiya
 • We brought changes in tax agreements with various countries, new agreements to bring black money from abroad
 • america sahit vibhinn deshon ke saath soochna ke aadan pradaan, information exchange kaa praavdhaan kiya
 • Another strong law in August 2016 to curb benami property of corrupt people
 • is kanoon se ek bahut bade chor daravaaje ko band kar diya gaya
 • The plan to declare undeclared income in the country with penalty revealed a large amount of undeclared income
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyo, With all these efforts, in the last two and a half years, about 1
25 lakh crore rupees of black money has come out from the corrupt
 aise karodon bharatvasi jinke rag rag main eemaandaaree daudti he unka maananaa he ki bhrashtachar, kaale dhan, benami sampatti, jaali note or aatankwaad ke khilaaf ladaai nirnaayak honi chahie
 Who would be an honest citizen who does not have to suffer the news that crores of rupees are found in the officers' house under the bed, or in sacks from place to place? aaj desh kii mudravyavastha kaa haal yah he ki desh main kul sikkon or noton kii mulya main 500 or 1,000 rupee vaale noton kaa hissaa lagbhag 80 se 90 pratishat tak pahunch gaya he
 Excess circulation of cash in the country has a direct relation with corruption
 bhrashtachar se arjeet cash kaa kaarobaar mahangaai par bada asar paidaa karata he
 The poor have to bear the brunt of this
 iskaa sidhaa prabhaav garib or madhyam varg kii kharidne kii shakti par padataa he
 You will have your own experience, when buying a house or land, you will take some money from you in check and most of the money will be sought in cash
 eemaandaar vyakti ke liye kuch bhi khareednaa, ek madhyam varg ke vyakti ke liye ghar khareednaa ho, uske paas kala dhan nahin he to musiibat ho jaati he
 Due to this business of cash, there is a lot of artificial increase, artificial increase in the value of many services and goods like house, land, higher education and medicine
 bhrashtachar se jamaa kiya gaya dhan ho yaa kaala dhan ho, ye donon benami hawala kaarobaar ko bal dete hai
 And we know that hawala is also used by the terrorists in the purchase of arms
 chunaavon main kaale dhan ke prabhaav kii charchaa to varshon se ho rahi he
 Brothers and sisters, desh ko bhrashtachar or kaale dhan rupi dimak se mukt karaane ke liye ek or sakht kadam uthaanaa jaruri ho gaya he
 Today midnight i

 When i hear that a poor widow comes forward to give up LPG subsidy, this sacrifice is also found in a retired school teacher when he comes forward to contribute to the Swachh Bharat Kosh from pension, when we hear that the poor tribals The mother's goat sells money to build toilets, a soldier comes forward to donate 57 thousand rupees to make his village a clean village
 maine to yah dekha he ki desh ke saamaanya naagarik kii ek hi tamanna he ki vah kuch bhi kar guzarane ko taiyaar he – bas desh kaa kalyaan ho
 Therefore, in the war against corruption, black money, counterfeit notes and terrorism, we can face some difficulty even for a few days

 Therefore, the Reserve Bank has decided that on 9 November all banks will remain closed for public works
 nagarikon ko asuvidha hogi
 i am confident that all the colleagues working in banks and post offices will successfully complete this sacred work in the interest of the country
 bhootkaal main unhone ye karke dikhaaya he
 i request the Janata Janardan so much that all citizens should be patient and cooperate with all banks and post office officers, this is my request and request
 bahano or bhaaiyo, From time to time, the Reserve Bank has been bringing in circulation of new high denomination notes with the consent of the Central Government
 2014 main reserve bank ne 5,000 or 10,000 rupee ke karency note kaa prastaav sarkaar ko bheja tha jise hamaari sarkaar ne vichaar-vimarsh ke baad asweekaar kar diya tha

 Every ordinary citizen can contribute in this fight against corruption, black money, fake currency
 bahano or bhaaiyo aapse is prakriya main jitna sahyog milegaa, shuddhikaran utana hi safal hoga
 It was a cause of concern for the country that corruption and black money were considered an easy part of life
 yah soch aaj hamaare rajnatik, saamaajik, or prashasnic jivan ko dimak kii tarah khaae ja rahaa he
 No part of the governance system is untouched by this termite
 tippaniyan From time to time, we have seen that if the general public mind of India has to choose one of corruption and inconvenience for a few days, then it is unheard of, i say, it is the unflinching citizen of my country will choose the inconvenience, but never corruption Will choose aapse main phir ek baar aahvaan karata hum ki aaie jaise aapane diwali ke parv main apane ghar or aas pados kii safai kii, vaise hi safai ke kaam ko aage badhaate hue, ham is mahayajna main apni purnahuti daalkar ise safal banaaie

 This business will continue to run as before
 in saare intazaam ke baavjood hamaare eemaandaar deshavaasiyon ko agar takalif kaa saamana karnaa padaa to anubhav yah bataata he ki is desh kaa saamaanya naagarik desh kii bhalaai ke liye tyaag karne or kathinaayee sahane ke liye kabhi bhi peeche nahin rahata he
 When i hear that a poor widow comes forward to give up LPG subsidy, this sacrifice is also found in a retired school teacher when he comes forward to contribute to the Swachh Bharat Kosh from pension, when we hear that the poor tribals The mother's goat sells money to build toilets, a soldier comes forward to donate 57 thousand rupees to make his village a clean village
 maine to yah dekha he ki desh ke saamaanya naagarik kii ek hi tamanna he ki vah kuch bhi kar guzarane ko taiyaar he – bas desh kaa kalyaan ho
 Therefore, in the war against corruption, black money, counterfeit notes and terrorism, we can face some difficulty even for a few days
 meraa puraa vishwaas he ki desh kaa prayek naagarik bhrashtachar ke khilaaf shuchita ke is mahayajna main milakar khadaa hoga
 My dear countrymen, diwali ke parv ke baad, ab eemaandaaree ke is utsav main, pramanikta ke is parv main aap bad chadh kar haath bataaen
 i fully believe that all political parties, political activists, social and educational institutions of the country, including all sections of society, including the media, will participate more actively in this great work than the government, play a positive role and make this work successful
 Will continue to do it
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, When i am putting these things in front of you, at the same time, different departments of the government are also getting information, be it bank, post office, railway, hospital, even their officials have no information before this
 Is received
 kyonki is kaam main gopneeyata bahut hi aavashyak thi
 In such a situation, the Reserve Bank, all banks and post offices have to make a lot of arrangements in a short time
 is vyavastha main kuch samay to jayega
 Therefore, the Reserve Bank has decided that on 9 November all banks will remain closed for public works
 nagarikon ko asuvidha hogi
 i am confident that all the colleagues working in banks and post offices will successfully complete this sacred work in the interest of the country
 bhootkaal main unhone ye karke dikhaaya he
 i request the Janata Janardan so much that all citizens should be patient and cooperate with all banks and post office officers, this is my request and request
 bahano or bhaaiyo, From time to time, the Reserve Bank has been bringing in circulation of new high denomination notes with the consent of the Central Government
 2014 main reserve bank ne 5,000 or 10,000 rupee ke karency note kaa prastaav sarkaar ko bheja tha jise hamaari sarkaar ne vichaar-vimarsh ke baad asweekaar kar diya tha
 In this entire process, the proposal of a new note of Rs 2,000 has been accepted by the Reserve Bank
 puri tarah se nae taur par dijin kiye gaye 500 rupee or 2,000 rupee ke nae karency note ab cirkulation main laayaa jayega
 In view of the past experiences of the Reserve Bank, the Reserve Bank will make necessary arrangements to ensure that the denomination of high denomination notes is now within a limit
 ant main mere pyaare deshavaasiyo i want to reiterate that there are moments in the history of a country when every person realizes that they too have to be a part of that moment
 use bhi raashtra hit main, raashtra nirmaan main apana yogadan dena he
 But such moments only come to be counted in everyone's life
 aaj samay hamen phir se ek avasar de rahaa he
 Every ordinary citizen can contribute in this fight against corruption, black money, fake currency
 bahano or bhaaiyo aapse is prakriya main jitna sahyog milegaa, shuddhikaran utana hi safal hoga
 It was a cause of concern for the country that corruption and black money were considered an easy part of life
 yah soch aaj hamaare rajnatik, saamaajik, or prashasnic jivan ko dimak kii tarah khaae ja rahaa he
 No part of the governance system is untouched by this termite
 tippaniyan From time to time, we have seen that if the general public mind of India has to choose one of corruption and inconvenience for a few days, then it is unheard of, i say, it is the unflinching citizen of my country will choose the inconvenience, but never corruption Will choose aapse main phir ek baar aahvaan karata hum ki aaie jaise aapane diwali ke parv main apane ghar or aas pados kii safai kii, vaise hi safai ke kaam ko aage badhaate hue, ham is mahayajna main apni purnahuti daalkar ise safal banaaie
 In view of the inconvenience in the great cause of such a big cleanliness, in such a big country, let us all celebrate Diwali of purity, show this faithfulness of India to the whole world, celebrate the festival of authenticity in the whole country so that corruption can be curbed, To crack down on black money, to enable those who play the game of fake notes, so that the money of the country can be used for the poor, every honest citizen should be successful in the country's prosperity Could not get a fair share, future generations proud to live your life
 main aap sabake sahyog ke liye puure vishwaas ke saath sava sau karod deshavaasiyon ki madad se bhrashtachar ke khilaaf is ladaai ko or aage le janaa chahta hum
 i am sure your support, your cooperation will be inspiring for generations to come
 main phir ek baar aapkaa hriday se aabhaar vyakt karata hum
 Long live Mother India
 pyaare deshavaasiyon, This is proof that the commonest citizen of India is honest, but dear countrymen, there have been moments in the history of development of every country when the need for a powerful and decisive step was felt
 is desh ne yah varshon se mahasoos kiya he ki bhrashtachar, kaala dhan, jaali note or aatankwaad - aise nasoor hai jo desh ko vikaas kii daud main peeche dhakelte hai
 They hollow out the country, the society inside itself
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyo, Who does not know the horrors of terrorism? How many innocent people are put to death
 lekin kya aapane sochaa he ki in aatankiyon ko paisa kahaan-kahaan se muhaiyaa hota he? seemaa paar ke hamaare shatru jaali noton ke jariye, nakli noton ke jariye apana dhandha bharat main chalaate hai or yah saalon se chal rahaa he
 Many times, traders of fake currency of 500 and thousand rupees have also been caught and these notes have also been confiscated
 bahano-bhaaiyo, On one side, the network of terrorism and counterfeit notes is destroying the country
 duusari ore bhrashtachar or kaale dhan kii chunauti desh ke saamne bani hui he
 We took several effective steps immediately after assuming the task, starting the fight against corruption and black money, such as: • kaale dhan kii jaanch ke liye supreme court ke purv jaj kii adhyakshata main SIT kaa gathan kiya
 • In 2015, we enacted a strong law for black money stashed abroad
 • kaale dhan ko videsh se laane ke liye vibhinn deshon ke saath tex samjhauton main hamane parivartan kiya, nae samjhaute kiye
 • Provided information exchange, information exchange with various countries including USA
 • bhrashtachariyon kii benami sampatti ko rokane ke liye agast 2016 main ek or majboot kanoon
 • This law closed a very large burglar door
 • desh main aghoshit aay ko penalty ke saath ghoshit karne kii yojana main kaaphi badi maatra main aghoshit aay ujagar hui
 My dear countrymen, in saare prayaason se, pichley dhai saalon main bhrashtachariyon se kareeb-kareeb sava lakh karod rupee kaa kaala dhan baahar aayaa he
 The crores of Indians whose honesty runs in their eyes believe that the fight against corruption, black money, benami property, fake currency and terrorism should be decisive
 koun eemaandaar nagirak aisa hoga jise afasaron ke ghar bistar ke neeche se, yaa jagah-jagah boriyon main karodon rupee paae jane kii khabar pidaa na hoti ho? Today, the condition of the country's currency is that the share of 500 and 1,000 rupee notes in the value of total coins and notes in the country has reached about 80 to 90 percent
 desh main cash kaa atyadhik cirkulation kaa ek sidhaa sambandh bhrashtachar se he
 The business of cash earned from corruption has a major impact on inflation
 isaki maar garibon ko jhelni padati he
 This directly affects the purchasing power of the poor and middle class
 aapkaa swayan kaa anubhav hoga, jab makaan yaa jameen kharidte vaqt aap se kuch dhan check main lenge or zyaadaatar dhanrashi cash main maangi jaati hogi
 Buying anything for an honest person, buying a house for a middle class person, if he does not have art money, then trouble comes
due cash ke is dhandhe ke kaaran makaan, jameen, ucch shiksha or chikitsa jaisi anek sevaaon or vastuon ke mulya main bahut zyada kritrim vruddhi hoti he, artificial increase hota he
 Whether it is money deposited by corruption or black money, both of them give strength to benami hawala business
 or ham jaanate hai ki hawala kaa upyog aatankiyon ne hathiyaar kii kharid farokht main bhi kiya he
 The impact of black money in elections has been discussed for years
 bahano-bhaaiyo, It has become necessary to take a more strict step to free the country from corruption and black money termites
 aaj madhya raatri yani 8 navambar 2016 kii raatri 12 baje se vartmaan main jari 500 rupee or 1,000 rupee ke karency note legal tender nahin rahenge yani ye mudraaen kanuunan amaanya hongi
 Transaction through old notes of 500 and 1,000 rupees will not be available from midnight today
 bhrashtachar, kaale dhan or jaali note ke kaarobaar main lipt desh virdohi or samaaj virdohi tatwon ke paas maujuud 500 evam 1,000 rupee ke puraane note ab keval kaagaj ke ek tukade ke samaan rah jaaenge
 Such citizens who are earning from property, hard work and honesty, their interests and their rights will be fully protected
 dhyaan rahe ki 100 rupee, 50 rupee, 20 rupee, 10 rupee, 5 rupee, 2 rupee or 1 rupaya kaa note or sabhi sikke niyamit hai or len dein ke liye upyog ho sakate hai
 There is no restriction on that
 hamaara yah kadam desh main bhrashtachar, kaala dhan evam jaali note ke khilaaf ham jo ladaai lard rahe hai, saamaanya naagarik jo ladaai lard rahaa he, usko isse takat milane vaali he

 ye kaarobaar jaisaa pehle chalata tha vaisaa hi chalata rahegaa
 Despite all these arrangements, if our honest countrymen suffered, then experience shows that the common citizen of this country is never left behind to sacrifice and suffer for the good of the country
 jab main sunata hum ki koi garib vidhwaa LPG sabsidi chhodane main aage aati he, yah tyaag ek ritred skool teacher main bhi paaya jaataa he jab wo pension se svachh bharat kosh main yogadan dene ko aage aata he, jab ham ye sunate hai ki garib adivasee maa kaa bakrii bechakar shauchalay banane ke liye paise laga detii he, ek faujee kaa apane gaanv ko svachh gaanv banane ke liye sattaavan hazaar rupee kaa daan dene ke liye aage aata he
 i have seen that the common citizen of the country has only one desire that he is ready to do anything - just welfare of the country
 atah bhrashtachar, kaala dhan, jaali note or aatankwaad ke khilaaf jang main ham log thodi si kathinaayee vah bhi kuch dinon ke liye to jhel hi sakate hai
 i fully believe that every citizen of the country will stand together against corruption in this Mahayagya of purity
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyo, After the festival of Diwali, now in this festival of sincerity, in this festival of authenticity, you raise your hands high
 meraa puraa vishwaas he ki desh ke sabhi raajnneetik dal, rajnatik kaaryakarta, saamaajik or shaikshanik sansthaaen, media sahit samaaj ke sabhi varg se is mahaan kaary main sarkaar se bhi zyada bad chadh kar bhaag lenge, sakaaratmak bhoomika adaa karenge or is kaary ko safal bana kar hi rahenge
 My dear countrymen, ye baaten jab main aapke samaksh rakh rahaa hum, isi samay sarkaar ke alag-alag vibhaagon ko bhi jaankaree ho rahi he, bank ho, post offis ho, railway ho, aspataal ho, unke adhikariyon ko bhi is vishay kii isse pehle koi jaankaree nahin mili he
 Because confidentiality was very important in this work
 aisi sthiti main reserve bank, sabhi banks or post offis ko kam samay main bahut sari vyavastha kerani he
 There will be some time in this system
 isliye reserve bank ne yah faisla liya he ki 9 navambar ko sabhi bank public kaary ke liye band rahenge
 Citizens will be inconvenienced
 meraa puraa bharosa he ki bank or post offis main kaam karne vaale sabhi saathi desh hit main is pavitra kaary ko safaltaapurvak paripurna karenge
 In the past, they have shown this by doing this
 meraa janata-janardan se itnaa hi aagrah he ki sabhi naagarik dhairya rakhte hue sabhi banks or post offis adhikariyon ke saath sahyog karen, yahi meri unase aagrah or binati he
 Sisters and brothers, samay-samay par mudravyavastha ko dhyaan main rakhkar reserve bank, centre sarkaar kii sahmati se nae adhik mulya ke note ko cirkulation main laata rahaa he
 In 2014, the Reserve Bank sent a proposal for a currency note of 5,000 and 10,000 rupees to the government, which was rejected by our government after deliberations
 ab is puri prakriya main reserve bank dwaara 2,000 rupee ke nae note ke prastaav ko sweekaar kiya gaya he
 The completely redesigned 500 rupees and new rupee notes of 2,000 rupees will now be brought in circulation
 reserve bank apane pichley anubhavon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue, karency cirkulation main adhik mulya ke noton kaa hissaa ab ek seemaa ke andar hi rahe iske liye reserve bank aavashyak prabandh karegaa
 Finally my dear countrymen main yah doharaana chahta hum ki kisi desh ke itihaas main aise kshan aate hai jab har vyakti yah mahasoos karata he ki use bhi us kshan kaa hissaa bananaa he
 He too has to contribute in the national interest, in nation building
 parantu aise kshan har kisi kii jindagi main gine chune hi aate hai
 Today, time is again giving us an opportunity
 har saamaanya naagarik bhrashtachar, kaala dhan, jaali note ke khilaaf is mahayajna main , is ladaai main apana yogadan de saktaa he
 Brothers and brothers, the more cooperation you get in this process, the more successful the purification will be
 desh ke liye yah chintaa kaa kaaran tha ki bhrashtachar or kaale dhan ko jivan kaa ek sahaj hissaa maan liya gaya tha
 This thinking is eating our political, social, and administrative life like a termite
 shashan vyavastha kaa koi bhi ang is dimak se achoota nahin he
 The comments samay-samay par hamane dekha he ki bharat ke saamaanya jan maanas ko agar bhrashtachar or kuch dinon kii asuvidha main se ek ko chunanaa ho, to vah behichak, main kahata hum behichak mere desh kaa eemaandaar naagarik asuvidha ko to chunegaa lekin bhrashtachar ko kadaapi nahin chunegaa
 i once again call upon you that, as you have cleaned your house and neighborhood in the festival of Diwali, in the same way, we can make it successful by putting our full sacrifice in this Mahayagya
 itane bade desh main, itani badi safai ke mahaparv main asuvidha ko dhyaan main na rakhte hue aaie sabhi shuchita kii diwali manaaen, puure vishwa ko bharat kii is eemaandaaree kaa utsav dikhaaen, puure desh main pramanikta kaa parv manaaen jisase bhrashtachar par lagaam lag sake, kaale dhan par nakel kas sake, jaali noton kaa khel khilne waalon ko nestnabud kar sake, jisase ki desh kaa dhan garibon ke kaam aa sake, har eemaandaar naagarik ko desh kii sampannataa main uski uchit hissedari mil sake, aane vaali peedi garv se apana jivan ji sake
 i want to take this fight against corruption further with the help of 125 crore countrymen with full confidence for your cooperation
 mujhe vishwaas he aapkaa saath, aapkaa sahyog aane vaali pidiyon ke liye prerak banegaa
 i once again express my heartfelt gratitude to you
 bharat mata kii jai
 This is proof that the commonest citizen of India is honest, but dear countrymen, there have been moments in the history of development of every country when the need for a powerful and decisive step was felt
 is desh ne yah varshon se mahasoos kiya he ki bhrashtachar, kaala dhan, jaali note or aatankwaad - aise nasoor hai jo desh ko vikaas kii daud main peeche dhakelte hai
 They hollow out the country, the society inside itself
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyo, Who does not know the horrors of terrorism? How many innocent people are put to death
 lekin kya aapane sochaa he ki in aatankiyon ko paisa kahaan-kahaan se muhaiyaa hota he? seemaa paar ke hamaare shatru jaali noton ke jariye, nakli noton ke jariye apana dhandha bharat main chalaate hai or yah saalon se chal rahaa he
 Many times, traders of fake currency of 500 and thousand rupees have also been caught and these notes have also been confiscated
 bahano-bhaaiyo, On one side, the network of terrorism and counterfeit notes is destroying the country
 duusari ore bhrashtachar or kaale dhan kii chunauti desh ke saamne bani hui he
 We took several effective steps immediately after assuming the task, starting the fight against corruption and black money, such as: • kaale dhan kii jaanch ke liye supreme court ke purv jaj kii adhyakshata main SIT kaa gathan kiya
 • In 2015, we enacted a strong law for black money stashed abroad
 • kaale dhan ko videsh se laane ke liye vibhinn deshon ke saath tex samjhauton main hamane parivartan kiya, nae samjhaute kiye
 • Provided information exchange, information exchange with various countries including USA
 • bhrashtachariyon kii benami sampatti ko rokane ke liye agast 2016 main ek or majboot kanoon
 • This law closed a very large burglar door
 • desh main aghoshit aay ko penalty ke saath ghoshit karne kii yojana main kaaphi badi maatra main aghoshit aay ujagar hui
 My dear countrymen, in saare prayaason se, pichley dhai saalon main bhrashtachariyon se kareeb-kareeb sava lakh karod rupee kaa kaala dhan baahar aayaa he
 The crores of Indians whose honesty runs in their eyes believe that the fight against corruption, black money, benami property, fake currency and terrorism should be decisive
 koun eemaandaar nagirak aisa hoga jise afasaron ke ghar bistar ke neeche se, yaa jagah-jagah boriyon main karodon rupee paae jane kii khabar pidaa na hoti ho? Today, the condition of the country's currency is that the share of 500 and 1,000 rupee notes in the value of total coins and notes in the country has reached about 80 to 90 percent
 desh main cash kaa atyadhik cirkulation kaa ek sidhaa sambandh bhrashtachar se he
 The business of cash earned from corruption has a major impact on inflation
 isaki maar garibon ko jhelni padati he
 This directly affects the purchasing power of the poor and middle class
 aapkaa swayan kaa anubhav hoga, jab makaan yaa jameen kharidte vaqt aap se kuch dhan check main lenge or zyaadaatar dhanrashi cash main maangi jaati hogi
 Buying anything for an honest person, buying a house for a middle class person, if he does not have art money, then trouble comes
 cash ke is dhandhe ke kaaran makaan, jameen, ucch shiksha or chikitsa jaisi anek sevaaon or vastuon ke mulya main bahut zyada kritrim vruddhi hoti he, artificial increase hota he
 Whether it is money deposited by corruption or black money, both of them give strength to benami hawala business
 or ham jaanate hai ki hawala kaa upyog aatankiyon ne hathiyaar kii kharid farokht main bhi kiya he
 The impact of black money in elections has been discussed for years
 bahano-bhaaiyo, It has become necessary to take a more strict step to free the country from corruption and black money termites

 Despite all these arrangements, if our honest countrymen suffered, then experience shows that the common citizen of this country is never left behind to sacrifice and suffer for the good of the country
 jab main sunata hum ki koi garib vidhwaa LPG sabsidi chhodane main aage aati he, yah tyaag ek ritred skool teacher main bhi paaya jaataa he jab wo pension se svachh bharat kosh main yogadan dene ko aage aata he, jab ham ye sunate hai ki garib adivasee maa kaa bakrii bechakar shauchalay banane ke liye paise laga detii he, ek faujee kaa apane gaanv ko svachh gaanv banane ke liye sattaavan hazaar rupee kaa daan dene ke liye aage aata he
 i have seen that the common citizen of the country has only one desire that he is ready to do anything - just welfare of the country
 atah bhrashtachar, kaala dhan, jaali note or aatankwaad ke khilaaf jang main ham log thodi si kathinaayee vah bhi kuch dinon ke liye to jhel hi sakate hai
 i fully believe that every citizen of the country will stand together against corruption in this Mahayagya of purity
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyo, After the festival of Diwali, now in this festival of sincerity, in this festival of authenticity, you raise your hands high
 meraa puraa vishwaas he ki desh ke sabhi raajnneetik dal, rajnatik kaaryakarta, saamaajik or shaikshanik sansthaaen, media sahit samaaj ke sabhi varg se is mahaan kaary main sarkaar se bhi zyada bad chadh kar bhaag lenge, sakaaratmak bhoomika adaa karenge or is kaary ko safal bana kar hi rahenge
 My dear countrymen, ye baaten jab main aapke samaksh rakh rahaa hum, isi samay sarkaar ke alag-alag vibhaagon ko bhi jaankaree ho rahi he, bank ho, post offis ho, railway ho, aspataal ho, unke adhikariyon ko bhi is vishay kii isse pehle koi jaankaree nahin mili he
 Because confidentiality was very important in this work
 aisi sthiti main reserve bank, sabhi banks or post offis ko kam samay main bahut sari vyavastha kerani he
 There will be some time in this system
 isliye reserve bank ne yah faisla liya he ki 9 navambar ko sabhi bank public kaary ke liye band rahenge
 Citizens will be inconvenienced
 meraa puraa bharosa he ki bank or post offis main kaam karne vaale sabhi saathi desh hit main is pavitra kaary ko safaltaapurvak paripurna karenge
 In the past, they have shown this by doing this
 meraa janata-janardan se itnaa hi aagrah he ki sabhi naagarik dhairya rakhte hue sabhi banks or post offis adhikariyon ke saath sahyog karen, yahi meri unase aagrah or binati he
 Sisters and brothers, samay-samay par mudravyavastha ko dhyaan main rakhkar reserve bank, centre sarkaar kii sahmati se nae adhik mulya ke note ko cirkulation main laata rahaa he
 In 2014, the Reserve Bank sent a proposal for a currency note of 5,000 and 10,000 rupees to the government, which was rejected by our government after deliberations
 ab is puri prakriya main reserve bank dwaara 2,000 rupee ke nae note ke prastaav ko sweekaar kiya gaya he
 The completely redesigned 500 rupees and new rupee notes of 2,000 rupees will now be brought in circulation
 reserve bank apane pichley anubhavon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue, karency cirkulation main adhik mulya ke noton kaa hissaa ab ek seemaa ke andar hi rahe iske liye reserve bank aavashyak prabandh karegaa
 Finally my dear countrymen main yah doharaana chahta hum ki kisi desh ke itihaas main aise kshan aate hai jab har vyakti yah mahasoos karata he ki use bhi us kshan kaa hissaa bananaa he
 He too has to contribute in the national interest, in nation building
 parantu aise kshan har kisi kii jindagi main gine chune hi aate hai
 Today, time is again giving us an opportunity
 har saamaanya naagarik bhrashtachar, kaala dhan, jaali note ke khilaaf is mahayajna main , is ladaai main apana yogadan de saktaa he
 Brothers and brothers, the more cooperation you get in this process, the more successful the purification will be
 desh ke liye yah chintaa kaa kaaran tha ki bhrashtachar or kaale dhan ko jivan kaa ek sahaj hissaa maan liya gaya tha
 This thinking is eating our political, social, and administrative life like a termite
 shashan vyavastha kaa koi bhi ang is dimak se achoota nahin he
 The comments samay-samay par hamane dekha he ki bharat ke saamaanya jan maanas ko agar bhrashtachar or kuch dinon kii asuvidha main se ek ko chunanaa ho, to vah behichak, main kahata hum behichak mere desh kaa eemaandaar naagarik asuvidha ko to chunegaa lekin bhrashtachar ko kadaapi nahin chunegaa
 i once again call upon you that, as you have cleaned your house and neighborhood in the festival of Diwali, in the same way, we can make it successful by putting our full sacrifice in this Mahayagya
 itane bade desh main, itani badi safai ke mahaparv main asuvidha ko dhyaan main na rakhte hue aaie sabhi shuchita kii diwali manaaen, puure vishwa ko bharat kii is eemaandaaree kaa utsav dikhaaen, puure desh main pramanikta kaa parv manaaen jisase bhrashtachar par lagaam lag sake, kaale dhan par nakel kas sake, jaali noton kaa khel khilne waalon ko nestnabud kar sake, jisase ki desh kaa dhan garibon ke kaam aa sake, har eemaandaar naagarik ko desh kii sampannataa main uski uchit hissedari mil sake, aane vaali peedi garv se apana jivan ji sake
 i want to take this fight against corruption further with the help of 125 crore countrymen with full confidence for your cooperation
 mujhe vishwaas he aapkaa saath, aapkaa sahyog aane vaali pidiyon ke liye prerak banegaa
 i once again express my heartfelt gratitude to you
 bharat mata kii jai
 My dear countrymen, aatankwaad kii bhayaanakta ko koun nahin jaanata he? kitne nirdosh logon ko maut ke ghat utaar diya jaataa he
 But have you thought from where the money is provided to these terrorists? Our enemies across the border run their business in India through counterfeit notes, counterfeit notes and this has been going on for years
 anek baar 500 or hajaar rupee ke jaali note kaa kaarobaar karne vaale pakade bhi gaye hai or ye note jabt bhi kiye gaye hai
 Brothers and sisters, ek taraf aatankwaad or jaali noton kaa jaal desh ko tabah kar rahaa he
 On the other hand, the challenge of corruption and black money remains before the country
 hamane kaary sanbhaalane ke turant baad bhrashtachar or kaale dhan ke khilaaf ladaai kii shuruyaat karte hue anek prabhavi kadam uthaae, jaise: • Set up SIT headed by former Supreme Court judge to investigate black money
 • videshon main jamaa kaale dhan ke liye 2015 main majboot kanoon banane kaa hamane kaam kiya
 • We brought changes in tax agreements with various countries, new agreements to bring black money from abroad
 • america sahit vibhinn deshon ke saath soochna ke aadan pradaan, information exchange kaa praavdhaan kiya
 • Another strong law in August 2016 to curb benami property of corrupt people
 • is kanoon se ek bahut bade chor daravaaje ko band kar diya gaya
 • The plan to declare undeclared income in the country with penalty revealed a large amount of undeclared income
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyo, With all these efforts, in the last two and a half years, about 1
25 lakh crore rupees of black money has come out from the corrupt
 aise karodon bharatvasi jinke rag rag main eemaandaaree daudti he unka maananaa he ki bhrashtachar, kaale dhan, benami sampatti, jaali note or aatankwaad ke khilaaf ladaai nirnaayak honi chahie
 Who would be an honest citizen who does not have to suffer the news that crores of rupees are found in the officers' house under the bed, or in sacks from place to place? aaj desh kii mudravyavastha kaa haal yah he ki desh main kul sikkon or noton kii mulya main 500 or 1,000 rupee vaale noton kaa hissaa lagbhag 80 se 90 pratishat tak pahunch gaya he
 Excess circulation of cash in the country has a direct relation with corruption
 bhrashtachar se arjeet cash kaa kaarobaar mahangaai par bada asar paidaa karata he
 The poor have to bear the brunt of this
 iskaa sidhaa prabhaav garib or madhyam varg kii kharidne kii shakti par padataa he
 You will have your own experience, when buying a house or land, you will take some money from you in check and most of the money will be sought in cash
 eemaandaar vyakti ke liye kuch bhi khareednaa, ek madhyam varg ke vyakti ke liye ghar khareednaa ho, uske paas kala dhan nahin he to musiibat ho jaati he
 Due to this business of cash, there is a lot of artificial increase, artificial increase in the value of many services and goods like house, land, higher education and medicine
 bhrashtachar se jamaa kiya gaya dhan ho yaa kaala dhan ho, ye donon benami hawala kaarobaar ko bal dete hai
 And we know that hawala is also used by the terrorists in the purchase of arms
 chunaavon main kaale dhan ke prabhaav kii charchaa to varshon se ho rahi he
 Brothers and sisters, desh ko bhrashtachar or kaale dhan rupi dimak se mukt karaane ke liye ek or sakht kadam uthaanaa jaruri ho gaya he
 Today midnight i

 aise naagarik jo sampatti, mehnat or eemaandaaree se kama rahen hai, unke hiton kii or unke haq kii puri raksha kii jaaegi

 This business will continue to run as before
 in saare intazaam ke baavjood hamaare eemaandaar deshavaasiyon ko agar takalif kaa saamana karnaa padaa to anubhav yah bataata he ki is desh kaa saamaanya naagarik desh kii bhalaai ke liye tyaag karne or kathinaayee sahane ke liye kabhi bhi peeche nahin rahata he
 When i hear that a poor widow comes forward to give up LPG subsidy, this sacrifice is also found in a retired school teacher when he comes forward to contribute to the Swachh Bharat Kosh from pension, when we hear that the poor tribals The mother's goat sells money to build toilets, a soldier comes forward to donate 57 thousand rupees to make his village a clean village
 maine to yah dekha he ki desh ke saamaanya naagarik kii ek hi tamanna he ki vah kuch bhi kar guzarane ko taiyaar he – bas desh kaa kalyaan ho
 Therefore, in the war against corruption, black money, counterfeit notes and terrorism, we can face some difficulty even for a few days

 Long live Mother India
 aatankwaad kii bhayaanakta ko koun nahin jaanata he? kitne nirdosh logon ko maut ke ghat utaar diya jaataa he
 But have you thought from where the money is provided to these terrorists? Our enemies across the border run their business in India through counterfeit notes, counterfeit notes and this has been going on for years
 anek baar 500 or hajaar rupee ke jaali note kaa kaarobaar karne vaale pakade bhi gaye hai or ye note jabt bhi kiye gaye hai
 Brothers and sisters, ek taraf aatankwaad or jaali noton kaa jaal desh ko tabah kar rahaa he
 On the other hand, the challenge of corruption and black money remains before the country
 hamane kaary sanbhaalane ke turant baad bhrashtachar or kaale dhan ke khilaaf ladaai kii shuruyaat karte hue anek prabhavi kadam uthaae, jaise: • Set up SIT headed by former Supreme Court judge to investigate black money
 • videshon main jamaa kaale dhan ke liye 2015 main majboot kanoon banane kaa hamane kaam kiya
 • We brought changes in tax agreements with various countries, new agreements to bring black money from abroad
 • america sahit vibhinn deshon ke saath soochna ke aadan pradaan, information exchange kaa praavdhaan kiya
 • Another strong law in August 2016 to curb benami property of corrupt people
 • is kanoon se ek bahut bade chor daravaaje ko band kar diya gaya
 • The plan to declare undeclared income in the country with penalty revealed a large amount of undeclared income
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyo, With all these efforts, in the last two and a half years, about 1
25 lakh crore rupees of black money has come out from the corrupt
 aise karodon bharatvasi jinke rag rag main eemaandaaree daudti he unka maananaa he ki bhrashtachar, kaale dhan, benami sampatti, jaali note or aatankwaad ke khilaaf ladaai nirnaayak honi chahie
 Who would be an honest citizen who does not have to suffer the news that crores of rupees are found in the officers' house under the bed, or in sacks from place to place? aaj desh kii mudravyavastha kaa haal yah he ki desh main kul sikkon or noton kii mulya main 500 or 1,000 rupee vaale noton kaa hissaa lagbhag 80 se 90 pratishat tak pahunch gaya he
 Excess circulation of cash in the country has a direct relation with corruption
 bhrashtachar se arjeet cash kaa kaarobaar mahangaai par bada asar paidaa karata he
 The poor have to bear the brunt of this
 iskaa sidhaa prabhaav garib or madhyam varg kii kharidne kii shakti par padataa he
 You will have your own experience, when buying a house or land, you will take some money from you in check and most of the money will be sought in cash
 eemaandaar vyakti ke liye kuch bhi khareednaa, ek madhyam varg ke vyakti ke liye ghar khareednaa ho, uske paas kala dhan nahin he to musiibat ho jaati he
 Due to this business of cash, there is a lot of artificial increase, artificial increase in the value of many services and goods like house, land, higher education and medicine
 bhrashtachar se jamaa kiya gaya dhan ho yaa kaala dhan ho, ye donon benami hawala kaarobaar ko bal dete hai
 And we know that hawala is also used by the terrorists in the purchase of arms
 chunaavon main kaale dhan ke prabhaav kii charchaa to varshon se ho rahi he
 Brothers and sisters, desh ko bhrashtachar or kaale dhan rupi dimak se mukt karaane ke liye ek or sakht kadam uthaanaa jaruri ho gaya he

 This business will continue to run as before
 in saare intazaam ke baavjood hamaare eemaandaar deshavaasiyon ko agar takalif kaa saamana karnaa padaa to anubhav yah bataata he ki is desh kaa saamaanya naagarik desh kii bhalaai ke liye tyaag karne or kathinaayee sahane ke liye kabhi bhi peeche nahin rahata he
 When i hear that a poor widow comes forward to give up LPG subsidy, this sacrifice is also found in a retired school teacher when he comes forward to contribute to the Swachh Bharat Kosh from pension, when we hear that the poor tribals The mother's goat sells money to build toilets, a soldier comes forward to donate 57 thousand rupees to make his village a clean village
 maine to yah dekha he ki desh ke saamaanya naagarik kii ek hi tamanna he ki vah kuch bhi kar guzarane ko taiyaar he – bas desh kaa kalyaan ho
 Therefore, in the war against corruption, black money, counterfeit notes and terrorism, we can face some difficulty even for a few days
 meraa puraa vishwaas he ki desh kaa prayek naagarik bhrashtachar ke khilaaf shuchita ke is mahayajna main milakar khadaa hoga
 My dear countrymen, diwali ke parv ke baad, ab eemaandaaree ke is utsav main, pramanikta ke is parv main aap bad chadh kar haath bataaen
 i fully believe that all political parties, political activists, social and educational institutions of the country, including all sections of society, including the media, will participate more actively in this great work than the government, play a positive role and make this work successful
 Will continue to do it
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, When i am putting these things in front of you, at the same time, different departments of the government are also getting information, be it bank, post office, railway, hospital, even their officials have no information before this
 Is received
 kyonki is kaam main gopneeyata bahut hi aavashyak thi
 In such a situation, the Reserve Bank, all banks and post offices have to make a lot of arrangements in a short time
 is vyavastha main kuch samay to jayega
 Therefore, the Reserve Bank has decided that on 9 November all banks will remain closed for public works
 nagarikon ko asuvidha hogi
 i am confident that all the colleagues working in banks and post offices will successfully complete this sacred work in the interest of the country
 bhootkaal main unhone ye karke dikhaaya he
 i request the Janata Janardan so much that all citizens should be patient and cooperate with all banks and post office officers, this is my request and request
 bahano or bhaaiyo, From time to time, the Reserve Bank has been bringing in circulation of new high denomination notes with the consent of the Central Government
 2014 main reserve bank ne 5,000 or 10,000 rupee ke karency note kaa prastaav sarkaar ko bheja tha jise hamaari sarkaar ne vichaar-vimarsh ke baad asweekaar kar diya tha
 In this entire process, the proposal of a new note of Rs 2,000 has been accepted by the Reserve Bank
 puri tarah se nae taur par dijin kiye gaye 500 rupee or 2,000 rupee ke nae karency note ab cirkulation main laayaa jayega
 In view of the past experiences of the Reserve Bank, the Reserve Bank will make necessary arrangements to ensure that the denomination of high denomination notes is now within a limit
 ant main mere pyaare deshavaasiyo i want to reiterate that there are moments in the history of a country when every person realizes that they too have to be a part of that moment
 use bhi raashtra hit main, raashtra nirmaan main apana yogadan dena he
 But such moments only come to be counted in everyone's life
 aaj samay hamen phir se ek avasar de rahaa he
 Every ordinary citizen can contribute in this fight against corruption, black money, fake currency
 bahano or bhaaiyo aapse is prakriya main jitna sahyog milegaa, shuddhikaran utana hi safal hoga
 It was a cause of concern for the country that corruption and black money were considered an easy part of life
 yah soch aaj hamaare rajnatik, saamaajik, or prashasnic jivan ko dimak kii tarah khaae ja rahaa he
 No part of the governance system is untouched by this termite
 tippaniyan From time to time, we have seen that if the general public mind of India has to choose one of corruption and inconvenience for a few days, then it is unheard of, i say, it is the unflinching citizen of my country will choose the inconvenience, but never corruption Will choose aapse main phir ek baar aahvaan karata hum ki aaie jaise aapane diwali ke parv main apane ghar or aas pados kii safai kii, vaise hi safai ke kaam ko aage badhaate hue, ham is mahayajna main apni purnahuti daalkar ise safal banaaie
 In view of the inconvenience in the great cause of such a big cleanliness, in such a big country, let us all celebrate Diwali of purity, show this faithfulness of India to the whole world, celebrate the festival of authenticity in the whole country so that corruption can be curbed, To crack down on black money, to enable those who play the game of fake notes, so that the money of the country can be used for the poor, every honest citizen should be successful in the country's prosperity Could not get a fair share, future generations proud to live your life

 Long live Mother India
 bahano-bhaaiyo, On one side, the network of terrorism and counterfeit notes is destroying the country
 duusari ore bhrashtachar or kaale dhan kii chunauti desh ke saamne bani hui he
 We took several effective steps immediately after assuming the task, starting the fight against corruption and black money, such as: • kaale dhan kii jaanch ke liye supreme court ke purv jaj kii adhyakshata main SIT kaa gathan kiya
 • In 2015, we enacted a strong law for black money stashed abroad
 • kaale dhan ko videsh se laane ke liye vibhinn deshon ke saath tex samjhauton main hamane parivartan kiya, nae samjhaute kiye
 • Provided information exchange, information exchange with various countries including USA
 • bhrashtachariyon kii benami sampatti ko rokane ke liye agast 2016 main ek or majboot kanoon
 • This law closed a very large burglar door
 • desh main aghoshit aay ko penalty ke saath ghoshit karne kii yojana main kaaphi badi maatra main aghoshit aay ujagar hui
 My dear countrymen, in saare prayaason se, pichley dhai saalon main bhrashtachariyon se kareeb-kareeb sava lakh karod rupee kaa kaala dhan baahar aayaa he
 The crores of Indians whose honesty runs in their eyes believe that the fight against corruption, black money, benami property, fake currency and terrorism should be decisive
 koun eemaandaar nagirak aisa hoga jise afasaron ke ghar bistar ke neeche se, yaa jagah-jagah boriyon main karodon rupee paae jane kii khabar pidaa na hoti ho? Today, the condition of the country's currency is that the share of 500 and 1,000 rupee notes in the value of total coins and notes in the country has reached about 80 to 90 percent
 desh main cash kaa atyadhik cirkulation kaa ek sidhaa sambandh bhrashtachar se he
 The business of cash earned from corruption has a major impact on inflation
 isaki maar garibon ko jhelni padati he
 This directly affects the purchasing power of the poor and middle class
 aapkaa swayan kaa anubhav hoga, jab makaan yaa jameen kharidte vaqt aap se kuch dhan check main lenge or zyaadaatar dhanrashi cash main maangi jaati hogi
 Buying anything for an honest person, buying a house for a middle class person, if he does not have art money, then trouble comes
 cash ke is dhandhe ke kaaran makaan, jameen, ucch shiksha or chikitsa jaisi anek sevaaon or vastuon ke mulya main bahut zyada kritrim vruddhi hoti he, artificial increase hota he
 Whether it is money deposited by corruption or black money, both of them give strength to benami hawala business
 or ham jaanate hai ki hawala kaa upyog aatankiyon ne hathiyaar kii kharid farokht main bhi kiya he
 The idea of black money in elections has been discussed for years
 bahano-bhaaiyo, It has become necessary to take a more strict step to free the country from corruption and black money termites
 aaj madhya raatri yani 8 navambar 2016 kii raatri 12 baje se vartmaan main jari 500 rupee or 1,000 rupee ke karency note legal tender nahin rahenge yani ye mudraaen kanuunan amaanya hongi

 dhyaan rahe ki 100 rupee, 50 rupee, 20 rupee, 10 rupee, 5 rupee, 2 rupee or 1 rupaya kaa note or sabhi sikke niyamit hai or len dein ke liye upyog ho sakate hai
 There is no restriction on that

 ye kaarobaar jaisaa pehle chalata tha vaisaa hi chalata rahegaa
 Despite all these arrangements, if our honest countrymen suffered, then experience shows that the common citizen of this country is never left behind to sacrifice and suffer for the good of the country
 jab main sunata hum ki koi garib vidhwaa LPG sabsidi chhodane main aage aati he, yah tyaag ek ritred skool teacher main bhi paaya jaataa he jab wo pension se svachh bharat kosh main yogadan dene ko aage aata he, jab ham ye sunate hai ki garib adivasee maa kaa bakrii bechakar shauchalay banane ke liye paise laga detii he, ek faujee kaa apane gaanv ko svachh gaanv banane ke liye sattaavan hazaar rupee kaa daan dene ke liye aage aata he
 i have seen that the common citizen of the country has only one desire that he is ready to do anything - just welfare of the country
 atah bhrashtachar, kaala dhan, jaali note or aatankwaad ke khilaaf jang main ham log thodi si kathinaayee vah bhi kuch dinon ke liye to jhel hi sakate hai
 i fully believe that every citizen of the country will stand together against corruption in this Mahayagya of purity
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyo, After the festival of Diwali, now in this festival of sincerity, in this festival of authenticity, you raise your hands high
 meraa puraa vishwaas he ki desh ke sabhi raajnneetik dal, rajnatik kaaryakarta, saamaajik or shaikshanik sansthaaen, media sahit samaaj ke sabhi varg se is mahaan kaary main sarkaar se bhi zyada bad chadh kar bhaag lenge, sakaaratmak bhoomika adaa karenge or is kaary ko safal bana kar hi rahenge
 My dear countrymen, ye baaten jab main aapke samaksh rakh rahaa hum, isi samay sarkaar ke alag-alag vibhaagon ko bhi jaankaree ho rahi he, bank ho, post offis ho, railway ho, aspataal ho, unke adhikariyon ko bhi is vishay kii isse pehle koi jaankaree nahin mili he
 Because confidentiality was very important in this work
 aisi sthiti main reserve bank, sabhi banks or post offis ko kam samay main bahut sari vyavastha kerani he
 There will be some time in this system
 isliye reserve bank ne yah faisla liya he ki 9 navambar ko sabhi bank public kaary ke liye band rahenge
 Citizens will be inconvenienced
 meraa puraa bharosa he ki bank or post offis main kaam karne vaale sabhi saathi desh hit main is pavitra kaary ko safaltaapurvak paripurna karenge
 In the past, they have shown this by doing this
 meraa janata-janardan se itnaa hi aagrah he ki sabhi naagarik dhairya rakhte hue sabhi banks or post offis adhikariyon ke saath sahyog karen, yahi meri unase aagrah or binati he
 Sisters and brothers, samay-samay par mudravyavastha ko dhyaan main rakhkar reserve bank, centre sarkaar kii sahmati se nae adhik mulya ke note ko cirkulation main laata rahaa he
 In 2014, the Reserve Bank sent a proposal for a currency note of 5,000 and 10,000 rupees to the government, which was rejected by our government after deliberations
 ab is puri prakriya main reserve bank dwaara 2,000 rupee ke nae note ke prastaav ko sweekaar kiya gaya he

 Brothers and brothers, the more cooperation you get in this process, the more successful the purification will be
 desh ke liye yah chintaa kaa kaaran tha ki bhrashtachar or kaale dhan ko jivan kaa ek sahaj hissaa maan liya gaya tha
 This thinking is eating our political, social, and administrative life like a termite
 shashan vyavastha kaa koi bhi ang is dimak se achoota nahin he
 The comments samay-samay par hamane dekha he ki bharat ke saamaanya jan maanas ko agar bhrashtachar or kuch dinon kii asuvidha main se ek ko chunanaa ho, to vah behichak, main kahata hum behichak mere desh kaa eemaandaar naagarik asuvidha ko to chunegaa lekin bhrashtachar ko kadaapi nahin chunegaa

 bharat mata kii jai
 On one side, the network of terrorism and counterfeit notes is destroying the country
 duusari ore bhrashtachar or kaale dhan kii chunauti desh ke saamne bani hui he
 We took several effective steps immediately after assuming the task, starting the fight against corruption and black money, such as: • kaale dhan kii jaanch ke liye supreme court ke purv jaj kii adhyakshata main SIT kaa gathan kiya
 • In 2015, we enacted a strong law for black money stashed abroad
 • kaale dhan ko videsh se laane ke liye vibhinn deshon ke saath tex samjhauton main hamane parivartan kiya, nae samjhaute kiye
 • Provided information exchange, information exchange with various countries including USA
 • bhrashtachariyon kii benami sampatti ko rokane ke liye agast 2016 main ek or majboot kanoon
 • This law closed a very large burglar door
 • desh main aghoshit aay ko penalty ke saath ghoshit karne kii yojana main kaaphi badi maatra main aghoshit aay ujagar hui
 My dear countrymen, in saare prayaason se, pichley dhai saalon main bhrashtachariyon se kareeb-kareeb sava lakh karod rupee kaa kaala dhan baahar aayaa he
 The crores of Indians whose honesty runs in their eyes believe that the fight against corruption, black money, benami property, fake currency and terrorism should be decisive
 koun eemaandaar nagirak aisa hoga jise afasaron ke ghar bistar ke neeche se, yaa jagah-jagah boriyon main karodon rupee paae jane kii khabar pidaa na hoti ho? Today, the condition of the country's currency is that the share of 500 and 1,000 rupee notes in the value of total coins and notes in the country has reached about 80 to 90 percent
 desh main cash kaa atyadhik cirkulation kaa ek sidhaa sambandh bhrashtachar se he
 The business of cash earned from corruption has a major impact on inflation
 isaki maar garibon ko jhelni padati he
 This directly affects the purchasing power of the poor and middle class
 aapkaa swayan kaa anubhav hoga, jab makaan yaa jameen kharidte vaqt aap se kuch dhan check main lenge or zyaadaatar dhanrashi cash main maangi jaati hogi
 Buying anything for an honest person, buying a house for a middle class person, if he does not have art money, then trouble comes
 cash ke is dhandhe ke kaaran makaan, jameen, ucch shiksha or chikitsa jaisi anek sevaaon or vastuon ke mulya main bahut zyada kritrim vruddhi hoti he, artificial increase hota he
 Whether it is money deposited by corruption or black money, both of them give strength to benami hawala business
 or ham jaanate hai ki hawala kaa upyog aatankiyon ne hathiyaar kii kharid farokht main bhi kiya he
 The impact of black money in elections has been discussed for years
 bahano-bhaaiyo, It has become necessary to take a more strict step to free the country from corruption and black money termites
 aaj madhya raatri yani 8 navambar 2016 kii raatri 12 baje se vartmaan main jari 500 rupee or 1,000 rupee ke karency note legal tender nahin rahenge yani ye mudraaen kanuunan amaanya hongi

 ye kaarobaar jaisaa pehle chalata tha vaisaa hi chalata rahegaa
 Despite all these arrangements, if our honest countrymen suffered, then experience shows that the common citizen of this country is never left behind to sacrifice and suffer for the good of the country
 jab main sunata hum ki koi garib vidhwaa LPG sabsidi chhodane main aage aati he, yah tyaag ek ritred skool teacher main bhi paaya jaataa he jab wo pension se svachh bharat kosh main yogadan dene ko aage aata he, jab ham ye sunate hai ki garib adivasee maa kaa bakrii bechakar shauchalay banane ke liye paise laga detii he, ek faujee kaa apane gaanv ko svachh gaanv banane ke liye sattaavan hazaar rupee kaa daan dene ke liye aage aata he
 i have seen that the common citizen of the country has only one desire that he is ready to do anything - just welfare of the country
 atah bhrashtachar, kaala dhan, jaali note or aatankwaad ke khilaaf jang main ham log thodi si kathinaayee vah bhi kuch dinon ke liye to jhel hi sakate hai
 i fully believe that every citizen of the country will stand together against corruption in this Mahayagya of purity
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyo, After the festival of Diwali, now in this festival of sincerity, in this festival of authenticity, you raise your hands high
 meraa puraa vishwaas he ki desh ke sabhi raajnneetik dal, rajnatik kaaryakarta, saamaajik or shaikshanik sansthaaen, media sahit samaaj ke sabhi varg se is mahaan kaary main sarkaar se bhi zyada bad chadh kar bhaag lenge, sakaaratmak bhoomika adaa karenge or is kaary ko safal bana kar hi rahenge
 My dear countrymen, ye baaten jab main aapke samaksh rakh rahaa hum, isi samay sarkaar ke alag-alag vibhaagon ko bhi jaankaree ho rahi he, bank ho, post offis ho, railway ho, aspataal ho, unke adhikariyon ko bhi is vishay kii isse pehle koi jaankaree nahin mili he
 Because confidentiality was very important in this work
 aisi sthiti main reserve bank, sabhi banks or post offis ko kam samay main bahut sari vyavastha kerani he
 There will be some time in this system
 isliye reserve bank ne yah faisla liya he ki 9 navambar ko sabhi bank public kaary ke liye band rahenge
 Citizens will be inconvenienced
 meraa puraa bharosa he ki bank or post offis main kaam karne vaale sabhi saathi desh hit main is pavitra kaary ko safaltaapurvak paripurna karenge
 In the past, they have shown this by doing this
 meraa janata-janardan se itnaa hi aagrah he ki sabhi naagarik dhairya rakhte hue sabhi banks or post offis adhikariyon ke saath sahyog karen, yahi meri unase aagrah or binati he
 Sisters and brothers, samay-samay par mudravyavastha ko dhyaan main rakhkar reserve bank, centre sarkaar kii sahmati se nae adhik mulya ke note ko cirkulation main laata rahaa he
 In 2014, the Reserve Bank sent a proposal for a currency note of 5,000 and 10,000 rupees to the government, which was rejected by our government after deliberations
 ab is puri prakriya main reserve bank dwaara 2,000 rupee ke nae note ke prastaav ko sweekaar kiya gaya he

 reserve bank apane pichley anubhavon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue, karency cirkulation main adhik mulya ke noton kaa hissaa ab ek seemaa ke andar hi rahe iske liye reserve bank aavashyak prabandh karegaa
 Finally my dear countrymen main yah doharaana chahta hum ki kisi desh ke itihaas main aise kshan aate hai jab har vyakti yah mahasoos karata he ki use bhi us kshan kaa hissaa bananaa he
 He too has to contribute in the national interest, in nation building
 parantu aise kshan har kisi kii jindagi main gine chune hi aate hai
 Today, time is again giving us an opportunity
 har saamaanya naagarik bhrashtachar, kaala dhan, jaali note ke khilaaf is mahayajna main , is ladaai main apana yogadan de saktaa he
 Brothers and brothers, the more cooperation you get in this process, the more successful the purification will be
 desh ke liye yah chintaa kaa kaaran tha ki bhrashtachar or kaale dhan ko jivan kaa ek sahaj hissaa maan liya gaya tha
 This thinking is eating our political, social, and administrative life like a termite
 shashan vyavastha kaa koi bhi ang is dimak se achoota nahin he
 The comments samay-samay par hamane dekha he ki bharat ke saamaanya jan maanas ko agar bhrashtachar or kuch dinon kii asuvidha main se ek ko chunanaa ho, to vah behichak, main kahata hum behichak mere desh kaa eemaandaar naagarik asuvidha ko to chunegaa lekin bhrashtachar ko kadaapi nahin chunegaa
 i once again call upon you that, as you have cleaned your house and neighborhood in the festival of Diwali, in the same way, we can make it successful by putting our full sacrifice in this Mahayagya

 Due to this business of cash, there is a lot of artificial increase, artificial increase in the value of many services and goods like house, land, higher education and medicine

 This business will continue to run as before
 in saare intazaam ke baavjood hamaare eemaandaar deshavaasiyon ko agar takalif kaa saamana karnaa padaa to anubhav yah bataata he ki is desh kaa saamaanya naagarik desh kii bhalaai ke liye tyaag karne or kathinaayee sahane ke liye kabhi bhi peeche nahin rahata he
 When i hear that a poor widow comes forward to give up LPG subsidy, this sacrifice is also found in a retired school teacher when he comes forward to contribute to the Swachh Bharat Kosh from pension, when we hear that the poor tribals The mother's goat sells money to build toilets, a soldier comes forward to donate 57 thousand rupees to make his village a clean village
 maine to yah dekha he ki desh ke saamaanya naagarik kii ek hi tamanna he ki vah kuch bhi kar guzarane ko taiyaar he – bas desh kaa kalyaan ho
 Therefore, in the war against corruption, black money, counterfeit notes and terrorism, we can face some difficulty even for a few days
 meraa puraa vishwaas he ki desh kaa prayek naagarik bhrashtachar ke khilaaf shuchita ke is mahayajna main milakar khadaa hoga
 My dear countrymen, diwali ke parv ke baad, ab eemaandaaree ke is utsav main, pramanikta ke is parv main aap bad chadh kar haath bataaen
 i fully believe that all political parties, political activists, social and educational institutions of the country, including all sections of society, including the media, will participate more actively in this great work than the government, play a positive role and make this work successful
 Will continue to do it
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, When i am putting these things in front of you, at the same time, different departments of the government are also getting information, be it bank, post office, railway, hospital, even their officials have no information before this
 Is received
 kyonki is kaam main gopneeyata bahut hi aavashyak thi
 In such a situation, the Reserve Bank, all banks and post offices have to make a lot of arrangements in a short time

 When i hear that a poor widow comes forward to give up LPG subsidy, this sacrifice is also found in a retired school teacher when he comes forward to contribute to the Swachh Bharat Kosh from pension, when we hear that the poor tribals The mother's goat sells money to build toilets, a soldier comes forward to donate 57 thousand rupees to make his village a clean village

 ye kaarobaar jaisaa pehle chalata tha vaisaa hi chalata rahegaa
 Despite all these arrangements, if our honest countrymen suffered, then experience shows that the common citizen of this country is never left behind to sacrifice and suffer for the good of the country
 jab main sunata hum ki koi garib vidhwaa LPG sabsidi chhodane main aage aati he, yah tyaag ek ritred skool teacher main bhi paaya jaataa he jab wo pension se svachh bharat kosh main yogadan dene ko aage aata he, jab ham ye sunate hai ki garib adivasee maa kaa bakrii bechakar shauchalay banane ke liye paise laga detii he, ek faujee kaa apane gaanv ko svachh gaanv banane ke liye sattaavan hazaar rupee kaa daan dene ke liye aage aata he
 i have seen that the common citizen of the country has only one desire that he is ready to do anything - just welfare of the country

 mere pyaare deshavaasiyo, After the festival of Diwali, now in this festival of sincerity, in this festival of authenticity, you raise your hands high

 My dear countrymen, ye baaten jab main aapke samaksh rakh rahaa hum, isi samay sarkaar ke alag-alag vibhaagon ko bhi jaankaree ho rahi he, bank ho, post offis ho, railway ho, aspataal ho, unke adhikariyon ko bhi is vishay kii isse pehle koi jaankaree nahin mili he
 Because confidentiality was very important in this work
 aisi sthiti main reserve bank, sabhi banks or post offis ko kam samay main bahut sari vyavastha kerani he
 There will be some time in this system
 isliye reserve bank ne yah faisla liya he ki 9 navambar ko sabhi bank public kaary ke liye band rahenge
 Citizens will be inconvenienced
 meraa puraa bharosa he ki bank or post offis main kaam karne vaale sabhi saathi desh hit main is pavitra kaary ko safaltaapurvak paripurna karenge
 In the past, they have shown this by doing this

 The crores of Indians whose honesty runs in their eyes believe that the fight against corruption, black money, benami property, fake currency and terrorism should be decisive
 koun eemaandaar nagirak aisa hoga jise afasaron ke ghar bistar ke neeche se, yaa jagah-jagah boriyon main karodon rupee paae jane kii khabar pidaa na hoti ho? Today, the condition of the country's currency is that the share of 500 and 1,000 rupee notes in the value of total coins and notes in the country has reached about 80 to 90 percent
 desh main cash kaa atyadhik cirkulation kaa ek sidhaa sambandh bhrashtachar se he
 The business of cash earned from corruption has a major impact on inflation

 This directly affects the purchasing power of the poor and middle class
 aapkaa swayan kaa anubhav hoga, jab makaan yaa jameen kharidte vaqt aap se kuch dhan check main lenge or zyaadaatar dhanrashi cash main maangi jaati hogi
 Buying anything for an honest person, buying a house for a middle class person, if he does not have art money, then trouble comes
 cash ke is dhandhe ke kaaran makaan, jameen, ucch shiksha or chikitsa jaisi anek sevaaon or vastuon ke mulya main bahut zyada kritrim vruddhi hoti he, artificial increase hota he
 Whether it is money deposited by corruption or black money, both of them give strength to benami hawala business
 or ham jaanate hai ki hawala kaa upyog aatankiyon ne hathiyaar kii kharid farokht main bhi kiya he
 The impact of black money in elections has been discussed for years

 ye kaarobaar jaisaa pehle chalata tha vaisaa hi chalata rahegaa
 Despite all these arrangements, if our honest countrymen suffered, then experience shows that the common citizen of this country is never left behind to sacrifice and suffer for the good of the country
 jab main sunata hum ki koi garib vidhwaa LPG sabsidi chhodane main aage aati he, yah tyaag ek ritred skool teacher main bhi paaya jaataa he jab wo pension se svachh bharat kosh main yogadan dene ko aage aata he, jab ham ye sunate hai ki garib adivasee maa kaa bakrii bechakar shauchalay banane ke liye paise laga detii he, ek faujee kaa apane gaanv ko svachh gaanv banane ke liye sattaavan hazaar rupee kaa daan dene ke liye aage aata he
 i have seen that the common citizen of the country has only one desire that he is ready to do anything - just welfare of the country
 atah bhrashtachar, kaala dhan, jaali note or aatankwaad ke khilaaf jang main ham log thodi si kathinaayee vah bhi kuch dinon ke liye to jhel hi sakate hai
 i fully believe that every citizen of the country will stand together against corruption in this Mahayagya of purity
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyo, After the festival of Diwali, now in this festival of sincerity, in this festival of authenticity, you raise your hands high
 meraa puraa vishwaas he ki desh ke sabhi raajnneetik dal, rajnatik kaaryakarta, saamaajik or shaikshanik sansthaaen, media sahit samaaj ke sabhi varg se is mahaan kaary main sarkaar se bhi zyada bad chadh kar bhaag lenge, sakaaratmak bhoomika adaa karenge or is kaary ko safal bana kar hi rahenge
 My dear countrymen, ye baaten jab main aapke samaksh rakh rahaa hum, isi samay sarkaar ke alag-alag vibhaagon ko bhi jaankaree ho rahi he, bank ho, post offis ho, railway ho, aspataal ho, unke adhikariyon ko bhi is vishay kii isse pehle koi jaankaree nahin mili he
 Because confidentiality was very important in this work
 aisi sthiti main reserve bank, sabhi banks or post offis ko kam samay main bahut sari vyavastha kerani he
 There will be some time in this system
 isliye reserve bank ne yah faisla liya he ki 9 navambar ko sabhi bank public kaary ke liye band rahenge
 Citizens will be inconvenienced
 meraa puraa bharosa he ki bank or post offis main kaam karne vaale sabhi saathi desh hit main is pavitra kaary ko safaltaapurvak paripurna karenge
 In the past, they have shown this by doing this
 meraa janata-janardan se itnaa hi aagrah he ki sabhi naagarik dhairya rakhte hue sabhi banks or post offis adhikariyon ke saath sahyog karen, yahi meri unase aagrah or binati he

 iskaa sidhaa prabhaav garib or madhyam varg kii kharidne kii shakti par padataa he
 You will have your own experience, when buying a house or land, you will take some money from you in check and most of the money will be sought in cash
 eemaandaar vyakti ke liye kuch bhi khareednaa, ek madhyam varg ke vyakti ke liye ghar khareednaa ho, uske paas kala dhan nahin he to musiibat ho jaati he
 Due to this business of cash, there is a lot of artificial increase, artificial increase in the value of many services and goods like house, land, higher education and medicine
 bhrashtachar se jamaa kiya gaya dhan ho yaa kaala dhan ho, ye donon benami hawala kaarobaar ko bal dete hai
 And we know that hawala is also used by the terrorists in the purchase of arms
 chunaavon main kaale dhan ke prabhaav kii charchaa to varshon se ho rahi he
 Brothers and sisters, desh ko bhrashtachar or kaale dhan rupi dimak se mukt karaane ke liye ek or sakht kadam uthaanaa jaruri ho gaya he

 When i hear that a poor widow comes forward to give up LPG subsidy, this sacrifice is also found in a retired school teacher when he comes forward to contribute to the Swachh Bharat Kosh from pension, when we hear that the poor tribals The mother's goat sells money to build toilets, a soldier comes forward to donate 57 thousand rupees to make his village a clean village
 maine to yah dekha he ki desh ke saamaanya naagarik kii ek hi tamanna he ki vah kuch bhi kar guzarane ko taiyaar he – bas desh kaa kalyaan ho
 Therefore, in the war against corruption, black money, counterfeit notes and terrorism, we can face some difficulty even for a few days

 kyonki is kaam main gopneeyata bahut hi aavashyak thi
 In such a situation, the Reserve Bank, all banks and post offices have to make a lot of arrangements in a short time
 is vyavastha main kuch samay to jayega
 Therefore, the Reserve Bank has decided that on 9 November all banks will remain closed for public works
 nagarikon ko asuvidha hogi
 i am confident that all the colleagues working in banks and post offices will successfully complete this sacred work in the interest of the country
 bhootkaal main unhone ye karke dikhaaya he

 When i hear that a poor widow comes forward to give up LPG subsidy, this sacrifice is also found in a retired school teacher when he comes forward to contribute to the Swachh Bharat Kosh from pension, when we hear that the poor tribals The mother's goat sells money to build toilets, a soldier comes forward to donate 57 thousand rupees to make his village a clean village

 nagarikon ko asuvidha hogi

 My dear countrymen, in saare prayaason se, pichley dhai saalon main bhrashtachariyon se kareeb-kareeb sava lakh karod rupee kaa kaala dhan baahar aayaa he
 The crores of Indians whose honesty runs in their eyes believe that the fight against corruption, black money, benami property, fake currency and terrorism should be decisive

 desh main cash kaa atyadhik cirkulation kaa ek sidhaa sambandh bhrashtachar se he
 The business of cash earned from corruption has a major impact on inflation

 Whether it is money deposited by corruption or black money, both of them give strength to benami hawala business

 The impact of black money in elections has been discussed for years

 ye kaarobaar jaisaa pehle chalata tha vaisaa hi chalata rahegaa
 Despite all these arrangements, if our honest countrymen suffered, then experience shows that the common citizen of this country is never left behind to sacrifice and suffer for the good of the country
 jab main sunata hum ki koi garib vidhwaa LPG sabsidi chhodane main aage aati he, yah tyaag ek ritred skool teacher main bhi paaya jaataa he jab wo pension se svachh bharat kosh main yogadan dene ko aage aata he, jab ham ye sunate hai ki garib adivasee maa kaa bakrii bechakar shauchalay banane ke liye paise laga detii he, ek faujee kaa apane gaanv ko svachh gaanv banane ke liye sattaavan hazaar rupee kaa daan dene ke liye aage aata he
 i have seen that the common citizen of the country has only one desire that he is ready to do anything - just welfare of the country
 atah bhrashtachar, kaala dhan, jaali note or aatankwaad ke khilaaf jang main ham log thodi si kathinaayee vah bhi kuch dinon ke liye to jhel hi sakate hai
 i fully believe that every citizen of the country will stand together against corruption in this Mahayagya of purity
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyo, After the festival of Diwali, now in this festival of sincerity, in this festival of authenticity, you raise your hands high
 meraa puraa vishwaas he ki desh ke sabhi raajnneetik dal, rajnatik kaaryakarta, saamaajik or shaikshanik sansthaaen, media sahit samaaj ke sabhi varg se is mahaan kaary main sarkaar se bhi zyada bad chadh kar bhaag lenge, sakaaratmak bhoomika adaa karenge or is kaary ko safal bana kar hi rahenge
 My dear countrymen, ye baaten jab main aapke samaksh rakh rahaa hum, isi samay sarkaar ke alag-alag vibhaagon ko bhi jaankaree ho rahi he, bank ho, post offis ho, railway ho, aspataal ho, unke adhikariyon ko bhi is vishay kii isse pehle koi jaankaree nahin mili he
 Because confidentiality was very important in this work
 aisi sthiti main reserve bank, sabhi banks or post offis ko kam samay main bahut sari vyavastha kerani he
 There will be some time in this system
 isliye reserve bank ne yah faisla liya he ki 9 navambar ko sabhi bank public kaary ke liye band rahenge
 Citizens will be inconvenienced
 meraa puraa bharosa he ki bank or post offis main kaam karne vaale sabhi saathi desh hit main is pavitra kaary ko safaltaapurvak paripurna karenge
 In the past, they have shown this by doing this
 meraa janata-janardan se itnaa hi aagrah he ki sabhi naagarik dhairya rakhte hue sabhi banks or post offis adhikariyon ke saath sahyog karen, yahi meri unase aagrah or binati he
 Sisters and brothers, samay-samay par mudravyavastha ko dhyaan main rakhkar reserve bank, centre sarkaar kii sahmati se nae adhik mulya ke note ko cirkulation main laata rahaa he
 In 2014, the Reserve Bank sent a proposal for a currency note of 5,000 and 10,000 rupees to the government, which was rejected by our government after deliberations
 ab is puri prakriya main reserve bank dwaara 2,000 rupee ke nae note ke prastaav ko sweekaar kiya gaya he
 The completely redesigned 500 rupees and new rupee notes of 2,000 rupees will now be brought in circulation
 reserve bank apane pichley anubhavon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue, karency cirkulation main adhik mulya ke noton kaa hissaa ab ek seemaa ke andar hi rahe iske liye reserve bank aavashyak prabandh karegaa
 Finally my dear countrymen main yah doharaana chahta hum ki kisi desh ke itihaas main aise kshan aate hai jab har vyakti yah mahasoos karata he ki use bhi us kshan kaa hissaa bananaa he
 He too has to contribute in the national interest, in nation building
 parantu aise kshan har kisi kii jindagi main gine chune hi aate hai
 Today, time is again giving us an opportunity

 Brothers and brothers, the more cooperation you get in this process, the more successful the purification will be
 desh ke liye yah chintaa kaa kaaran tha ki bhrashtachar or kaale dhan ko jivan kaa ek sahaj hissaa maan liya gaya tha

 bharat mata kii jai
 My dear countrymen, in saare prayaason se, pichley dhai saalon main bhrashtachariyon se kareeb-kareeb sava lakh karod rupee kaa kaala dhan baahar aayaa he
 The crores of Indians whose honesty runs in their eyes believe that the fight against corruption, black money, benami property, fake currency and terrorism should be decisive
 koun eemaandaar nagirak aisa hoga jise afasaron ke ghar bistar ke neeche se, yaa jagah-jagah boriyon main karodon rupee paae jane kii khabar pidaa na hoti ho? Today, the condition of the country's currency is that the share of 500 and 1,000 rupee notes in the value of total coins and notes in the country has reached about 80 to 90 percent
 desh main cash kaa atyadhik cirkulation kaa ek sidhaa sambandh bhrashtachar se he
 The business of cash earned from corruption has a major impact on inflation
 isaki maar garibon ko jhelni padati he
 This directly affects the purchasing power of the poor and middle class
 aapkaa swayan kaa anubhav hoga, jab makaan yaa jameen kharidte vaqt aap se kuch dhan check main lenge or zyaadaatar dhanrashi cash main maangi jaati hogi
 Buying anything for an honest person, buying a house for a middle class person, if he does not have art money, then trouble comes
 cash ke is dhandhe ke kaaran makaan, jameen, ucch shiksha or chikitsa jaisi anek sevaaon or vastuon ke mulya main bahut zyada kritrim vruddhi hoti he, artificial increase hota he
 Whether it is money deposited by corruption or black money, both of them give strength to benami hawala business
 or ham jaanate hai ki hawala kaa upyog aatankiyon ne hathiyaar kii kharid farokht main bhi kiya he
 The impact of black money in elections has been discussed for years
 bahano-bhaaiyo, It has become necessary to take a more strict step to free the country from corruption and black money termites

 ye kaarobaar jaisaa pehle chalata tha vaisaa hi chalata rahegaa
 Despite all these arrangements, if our honest countrymen suffered, then experience shows that the common citizen of this country is never left behind to sacrifice and suffer for the good of the country
 jab main sunata hum ki koi garib vidhwaa LPG sabsidi chhodane main aage aati he, yah tyaag ek ritred skool teacher main bhi paaya jaataa he jab wo pension se svachh bharat kosh main yogadan dene ko aage aata he, jab ham ye sunate hai ki garib adivasee maa kaa bakrii bechakar shauchalay banane ke liye paise laga detii he, ek faujee kaa apane gaanv ko svachh gaanv banane ke liye sattaavan hazaar rupee kaa daan dene ke liye aage aata he
 i have seen that the common citizen of the country has only one desire that he is ready to do anything - just welfare of the country
 atah bhrashtachar, kaala dhan, jaali note or aatankwaad ke khilaaf jang main ham log thodi si kathinaayee vah bhi kuch dinon ke liye to jhel hi sakate hai
 i fully believe that every citizen of the country will stand together against corruption in this Mahayagya of purity
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyo, After the festival of Diwali, now in this festival of sincerity, in this festival of authenticity, you raise your hands high
 meraa puraa vishwaas he ki desh ke sabhi raajnneetik dal, rajnatik kaaryakarta, saamaajik or shaikshanik sansthaaen, media sahit samaaj ke sabhi varg se is mahaan kaary main sarkaar se bhi zyada bad chadh kar bhaag lenge, sakaaratmak bhoomika adaa karenge or is kaary ko safal bana kar hi rahenge
 My dear countrymen, ye baaten jab main aapke samaksh rakh rahaa hum, isi samay sarkaar ke alag-alag vibhaagon ko bhi jaankaree ho rahi he, bank ho, post offis ho, railway ho, aspataal ho, unke adhikariyon ko bhi is vishay kii isse pehle koi jaankaree nahin mili he
 Because confidentiality was very important in this work
 aisi sthiti main reserve bank, sabhi banks or post offis ko kam samay main bahut sari vyavastha kerani he
 There will be some time in this system
 isliye reserve bank ne yah faisla liya he ki 9 navambar ko sabhi bank public kaary ke liye band rahenge
 Citizens will be inconvenienced
 meraa puraa bharosa he ki bank or post offis main kaam karne vaale sabhi saathi desh hit main is pavitra kaary ko safaltaapurvak paripurna karenge
 In the past, they have shown this by doing this
 meraa janata-janardan se itnaa hi aagrah he ki sabhi naagarik dhairya rakhte hue sabhi banks or post offis adhikariyon ke saath sahyog karen, yahi meri unase aagrah or binati he
 Sisters and brothers, samay-samay par mudravyavastha ko dhyaan main rakhkar reserve bank, centre sarkaar kii sahmati se nae adhik mulya ke note ko cirkulation main laata rahaa he
 In 2014, the Reserve Bank sent a proposal for a currency note of 5,000 and 10,000 rupees to the government, which was rejected by our government after deliberations
 ab is puri prakriya main reserve bank dwaara 2,000 rupee ke nae note ke prastaav ko sweekaar kiya gaya he
 The completely redesigned 500 rupees and new rupee notes of 2,000 rupees will now be brought in circulation
 reserve bank apane pichley anubhavon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue, karency cirkulation main adhik mulya ke noton kaa hissaa ab ek seemaa ke andar hi rahe iske liye reserve bank aavashyak prabandh karegaa
 Finally my dear countrymen main yah doharaana chahta hum ki kisi desh ke itihaas main aise kshan aate hai jab har vyakti yah mahasoos karata he ki use bhi us kshan kaa hissaa bananaa he
 He too has to contribute in the national interest, in nation building
 parantu aise kshan har kisi kii jindagi main gine chune hi aate hai
 Today, time is again giving us an opportunity
 har saamaanya naagarik bhrashtachar, kaala dhan, jaali note ke khilaaf is mahayajna main , is ladaai main apana yogadan de saktaa he
 Brothers and brothers, the more cooperation you get in this process, the more successful the purification will be
 desh ke liye yah chintaa kaa kaaran tha ki bhrashtachar or kaale dhan ko jivan kaa ek sahaj hissaa maan liya gaya tha
 This thinking is eating our political, social, and administrative life like a termite
 shashan vyavastha kaa koi bhi ang is dimak se achoota nahin he
 The comments samay-samay par hamane dekha he ki bharat ke saamaanya jan maanas ko agar bhrashtachar or kuch dinon kii asuvidha main se ek ko chunanaa ho, to vah behichak, main kahata hum behichak mere desh kaa eemaandaar naagarik asuvidha ko to chunegaa lekin bhrashtachar ko kadaapi nahin chunegaa
 i once again call upon you that, as you have cleaned your house and neighborhood in the festival of Diwali, in the same way, we can make it successful by putting our full sacrifice in this Mahayagya
 itane bade desh main, itani badi safai ke mahaparv main asuvidha ko dhyaan main na rakhte hue aaie sabhi shuchita kii diwali manaaen, puure vishwa ko bharat kii is eemaandaaree kaa utsav dikhaaen, puure desh main pramanikta kaa parv manaaen jisase bhrashtachar par lagaam lag sake, kaale dhan par nakel kas sake, jaali noton kaa khel khilne waalon ko nestnabud kar sake, jisase ki desh kaa dhan garibon ke kaam aa sake, har eemaandaar naagarik ko desh kii sampannataa main uski uchit hissedari mil sake, aane vaali peedi garv se apana jivan ji sake
 i want to take this fight against corruption further with the help of 125 crore countrymen with full confidence for your cooperation
 mujhe vishwaas he aapkaa saath, aapkaa sahyog aane vaali pidiyon ke liye prerak banegaa
 i once again express my heartfelt gratitude to you
 bharat mata kii jai
 With all these efforts, in the last two and a half years, about 1
25 lakh crore rupees of black money has come out from the corrupt
 aise karodon bharatvasi jinke rag rag main eemaandaaree daudti he unka maananaa he ki bhrashtachar, kaale dhan, benami sampatti, jaali note or aatankwaad ke khilaaf ladaai nirnaayak honi chahie
 Who would be an honest citizen who does not have to suffer the news that crores of rupees are found in the officers' house under the bed, or in sacks from place to place? aaj desh kii mudravyavastha kaa haal yah he ki desh main kul sikkon or noton kii mulya main 500 or 1,000 rupee vaale noton kaa hissaa lagbhag 80 se 90 pratishat tak pahunch gaya he
 Excess circulation of cash in the country has a direct relation with corruption
 bhrashtachar se arjeet cash kaa kaarobaar mahangaai par bada asar paidaa karata he
 The poor have to bear the brunt of this
 iskaa sidhaa prabhaav garib or madhyam varg kii kharidne kii shakti par padataa he
 You will have your own experience, when buying a house or land, you will take some money from you in check and most of the money will be sought in cash
 eemaandaar vyakti ke liye kuch bhi khareednaa, ek madhyam varg ke vyakti ke liye ghar khareednaa ho, uske paas kala dhan nahin he to musiibat ho jaati he
 Due to this business of cash, there is a lot of artificial increase, artificial increase in the value of many services and goods like house, land, higher education and medicine
 bhrashtachar se jamaa kiya gaya dhan ho yaa kaala dhan ho, ye donon benami hawala kaarobaar ko bal dete hai
 And we know that hawala is also used by the terrorists in the purchase of arms
 chunaavon main kaale dhan ke prabhaav kii charchaa to varshon se ho rahi he
 Brothers and sisters, desh ko bhrashtachar or kaale dhan rupi dimak se mukt karaane ke liye ek or sakht kadam uthaanaa jaruri ho gaya he
 Today midnight i
e
 from 8 pm on November 8, 2016, currency notes of 500 rupees and 1,000 rupees currently issued will not be legal tender i
e
 these currencies will be invalid by law
 500 or 1,000 rupee ke puraane noton ke jariye len dein kii vyavastha aaj madhya raatri se uplabdh nahin hogi
 The old notes of 500 and 1,000 rupees present with the anti-national and anti-social elements involved in the business of corruption, black money and fake notes will now be left just like a piece of paper
 aise naagarik jo sampatti, mehnat or eemaandaaree se kama rahen hai, unke hiton kii or unke haq kii puri raksha kii jaaegi
 Keep in mind that 100 rupees, 50 rupees, 20 rupees, 10 rupees, 5 rupees, 2 rupees and 1 rupee notes and all coins are regular and can be used for transactions
 us par koi roak nahin he
 This step of ours is going to give strength to the fight against corruption, black money and fake currency in the country, the ordinary citizen who is fighting

 13
 Although the old notes of 500 and 1,000 rupees will legally end from 12 o'clock tonight, but keeping in mind the needs of normal life, from the human point of view, we started this process in the 72 hours i
e
 11 November night
 Till 12 o'clock, some special arrangements have been made for the citizens

 The old 500 or Rs 1,000 notes will be accepted for payment in all government hospitals by 12 pm on 11 November

 centre athwa rajya sarkaar dwaara pramanit koaparative kii dincharya kii vastuon kii duukaan (jaise kendriya bhandar, safal) or dugdh vikray kendron (milk parlor) main bhi 11 navambar kii raat 12 baje tak puraane 500 or 1,000 rupee ke note sweekaar karne kii chhot hogi

 21
 antarrashtriya hawaii addon par videsh se aa rahe yaa videsh ko ja rahe logon ko agar unke paas puraane 500 or 1,000 ke note hai to aise noton kii 5,000 rupee tak kii raashi ko nai evam maanya karency noton se badalane kii suvidha di jaaegi

 in sari suvidhaon ke alaava main yah spasht karnaa chaahunga ki is puri prakriya main non-cash len dein main yani check se pement, demand draft se pement, debit yaa credit card se pement athwa electronic fund transafar main koi rukaawat nahin aegi
 This business will continue to run as before
 in saare intazaam ke baavjood hamaare eemaandaar deshavaasiyon ko agar takalif kaa saamana karnaa padaa to anubhav yah bataata he ki is desh kaa saamaanya naagarik desh kii bhalaai ke liye tyaag karne or kathinaayee sahane ke liye kabhi bhi peeche nahin rahata he
 When i hear that a poor widow comes forward to give up LPG subsidy, this sacrifice is also found in a retired school teacher when he comes forward to contribute to the Swachh Bharat Kosh from pension, when we hear that the poor tribals The mother's goat sells money to build toilets, a soldier comes forward to donate 57 thousand rupees to make his village a clean village
 maine to yah dekha he ki desh ke saamaanya naagarik kii ek hi tamanna he ki vah kuch bhi kar guzarane ko taiyaar he – bas desh kaa kalyaan ho
 Therefore, in the war against corruption, black money, counterfeit notes and terrorism, we can face some difficulty even for a few days
 meraa puraa vishwaas he ki desh kaa prayek naagarik bhrashtachar ke khilaaf shuchita ke is mahayajna main milakar khadaa hoga
 My dear countrymen, diwali ke parv ke baad, ab eemaandaaree ke is utsav main, pramanikta ke is parv main aap bad chadh kar haath bataaen
 i fully believe that all political parties, political activists, social and educational institutions of the country, including all sections of society, including the media, will participate more actively in this great work than the government, play a positive role and make this work successful
 Will continue to do it
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, When i am putting these things in front of you, at the same time, different departments of the government are also getting information, be it bank, post office, railway, hospital, even their officials have no information before this
 Is received
 kyonki is kaam main gopneeyata bahut hi aavashyak thi
 In such a situation, the Reserve Bank, all banks and post offices have to make a lot of arrangements in a short time
 is vyavastha main kuch samay to jayega
 Therefore, the Reserve Bank has decided that on 9 November all banks will remain closed for public works
 nagarikon ko asuvidha hogi
 i am confident that all the colleagues working in banks and post offices will successfully complete this sacred work in the interest of the country
 bhootkaal main unhone ye karke dikhaaya he
 i request the Janata Janardan so much that all citizens should be patient and cooperate with all banks and post office officers, this is my request and request
 bahano or bhaaiyo, From time to time, the Reserve Bank has been bringing in circulation of new high denomination notes with the consent of the Central Government
 2014 main reserve bank ne 5,000 or 10,000 rupee ke karency note kaa prastaav sarkaar ko bheja tha jise hamaari sarkaar ne vichaar-vimarsh ke baad asweekaar kar diya tha
 In this entire process, the proposal of a new note of Rs 2,000 has been accepted by the Reserve Bank
 puri tarah se nae taur par dijin kiye gaye 500 rupee or 2,000 rupee ke nae karency note ab cirkulation main laayaa jayega
 In view of the past experiences of the Reserve Bank, the Reserve Bank will make necessary arrangements to ensure that the denomination of high denomination notes is now within a limit
 ant main mere pyaare deshavaasiyo i want to reiterate that there are moments in the history of a country when every person realizes that they too have to be a part of that moment
 use bhi raashtra hit main, raashtra nirmaan main apana yogadan dena he
 But such moments only come to be counted in everyone's life
 aaj samay hamen phir se ek avasar de rahaa he
 Every ordinary citizen can contribute in this fight against corruption, black money, fake currency
 bahano or bhaaiyo aapse is prakriya main jitna sahyog milegaa, shuddhikaran utana hi safal hoga
 It was a cause of concern for the country that corruption and black money were considered an easy part of life
 yah soch aaj hamaare rajnatik, saamaajik, or prashasnic jivan ko dimak kii tarah khaae ja rahaa he

 When i hear that a poor widow comes forward to give up LPG subsidy, this sacrifice is also found in a retired school teacher when he comes forward to contribute to the Swachh Bharat Kosh from pension, when we hear that the poor tribals The mother's goat sells money to build toilets, a soldier comes forward to donate 57 thousand rupees to make his village a clean village
 maine to yah dekha he ki desh ke saamaanya naagarik kii ek hi tamanna he ki vah kuch bhi kar guzarane ko taiyaar he – bas desh kaa kalyaan ho
 Therefore, in the war against corruption, black money, counterfeit notes and terrorism, we can face some difficulty even for a few days

 Is received
 kyonki is kaam main gopneeyata bahut hi aavashyak thi
 In such a situation, the Reserve Bank, all banks and post offices have to make a lot of arrangements in a short time
 is vyavastha main kuch samay to jayega
 Therefore, the Reserve Bank has decided that on 9 November all banks will remain closed for public works
 nagarikon ko asuvidha hogi
 i am confident that all the colleagues working in banks and post offices will successfully complete this sacred work in the interest of the country
 bhootkaal main unhone ye karke dikhaaya he
 i request the Janata Janardan so much that all citizens should be patient and cooperate with all banks and post office officers, this is my request and request
 bahano or bhaaiyo, From time to time, the Reserve Bank has been bringing in circulation of new high denomination notes with the consent of the Central Government
 2014 main reserve bank ne 5,000 or 10,000 rupee ke karency note kaa prastaav sarkaar ko bheja tha jise hamaari sarkaar ne vichaar-vimarsh ke baad asweekaar kar diya tha

 use bhi raashtra hit main, raashtra nirmaan main apana yogadan dena he
 But such moments only come to be counted in everyone's life
 aaj samay hamen phir se ek avasar de rahaa he
 Every ordinary citizen can contribute in this fight against corruption, black money, fake currency
 bahano or bhaaiyo aapse is prakriya main jitna sahyog milegaa, shuddhikaran utana hi safal hoga
 It was a cause of concern for the country that corruption and black money were considered an easy part of life
 yah soch aaj hamaare rajnatik, saamaajik, or prashasnic jivan ko dimak kii tarah khaae ja rahaa he
 No part of the governance system is untouched by this termite

 The business of cash earned from corruption has a major impact on inflation

 Despite all these arrangements, if our honest countrymen suffered, then experience shows that the common citizen of this country is never left behind to sacrifice and suffer for the good of the country
 jab main sunata hum ki koi garib vidhwaa LPG sabsidi chhodane main aage aati he, yah tyaag ek ritred skool teacher main bhi paaya jaataa he jab wo pension se svachh bharat kosh main yogadan dene ko aage aata he, jab ham ye sunate hai ki garib adivasee maa kaa bakrii bechakar shauchalay banane ke liye paise laga detii he, ek faujee kaa apane gaanv ko svachh gaanv banane ke liye sattaavan hazaar rupee kaa daan dene ke liye aage aata he
 i have seen that the common citizen of the country has only one desire that he is ready to do anything - just welfare of the country
 atah bhrashtachar, kaala dhan, jaali note or aatankwaad ke khilaaf jang main ham log thodi si kathinaayee vah bhi kuch dinon ke liye to jhel hi sakate hai
 i fully believe that every citizen of the country will stand together against corruption in this Mahayagya of purity
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyo, After the festival of Diwali, now in this festival of sincerity, in this festival of authenticity, you raise your hands high
 meraa puraa vishwaas he ki desh ke sabhi raajnneetik dal, rajnatik kaaryakarta, saamaajik or shaikshanik sansthaaen, media sahit samaaj ke sabhi varg se is mahaan kaary main sarkaar se bhi zyada bad chadh kar bhaag lenge, sakaaratmak bhoomika adaa karenge or is kaary ko safal bana kar hi rahenge
 My dear countrymen, ye baaten jab main aapke samaksh rakh rahaa hum, isi samay sarkaar ke alag-alag vibhaagon ko bhi jaankaree ho rahi he, bank ho, post offis ho, railway ho, aspataal ho, unke adhikariyon ko bhi is vishay kii isse pehle koi jaankaree nahin mili he
 Because confidentiality was very important in this work
 aisi sthiti main reserve bank, sabhi banks or post offis ko kam samay main bahut sari vyavastha kerani he
 There will be some time in this system
 isliye reserve bank ne yah faisla liya he ki 9 navambar ko sabhi bank public kaary ke liye band rahenge
 Citizens will be inconvenienced
 meraa puraa bharosa he ki bank or post offis main kaam karne vaale sabhi saathi desh hit main is pavitra kaary ko safaltaapurvak paripurna karenge
 In the past, they have shown this by doing this
 meraa janata-janardan se itnaa hi aagrah he ki sabhi naagarik dhairya rakhte hue sabhi banks or post offis adhikariyon ke saath sahyog karen, yahi meri unase aagrah or binati he
 Sisters and brothers, samay-samay par mudravyavastha ko dhyaan main rakhkar reserve bank, centre sarkaar kii sahmati se nae adhik mulya ke note ko cirkulation main laata rahaa he
 In 2014, the Reserve Bank sent a proposal for a currency note of 5,000 and 10,000 rupees to the government, which was rejected by our government after deliberations
 ab is puri prakriya main reserve bank dwaara 2,000 rupee ke nae note ke prastaav ko sweekaar kiya gaya he
 The completely redesigned 500 rupees and new rupee notes of 2,000 rupees will now be brought in circulation
 reserve bank apane pichley anubhavon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue, karency cirkulation main adhik mulya ke noton kaa hissaa ab ek seemaa ke andar hi rahe iske liye reserve bank aavashyak prabandh karegaa
 Finally my dear countrymen main yah doharaana chahta hum ki kisi desh ke itihaas main aise kshan aate hai jab har vyakti yah mahasoos karata he ki use bhi us kshan kaa hissaa bananaa he
 He too has to contribute in the national interest, in nation building
 parantu aise kshan har kisi kii jindagi main gine chune hi aate hai
 Today, time is again giving us an opportunity
 har saamaanya naagarik bhrashtachar, kaala dhan, jaali note ke khilaaf is mahayajna main , is ladaai main apana yogadan de saktaa he
 Brothers and brothers, the more cooperation you get in this process, the more successful the purification will be
 desh ke liye yah chintaa kaa kaaran tha ki bhrashtachar or kaale dhan ko jivan kaa ek sahaj hissaa maan liya gaya tha
 This thinking is eating our political, social, and administrative life like a termite
 shashan vyavastha kaa koi bhi ang is dimak se achoota nahin he
 The comments samay-samay par hamane dekha he ki bharat ke saamaanya jan maanas ko agar bhrashtachar or kuch dinon kii asuvidha main se ek ko chunanaa ho, to vah behichak, main kahata hum behichak mere desh kaa eemaandaar naagarik asuvidha ko to chunegaa lekin bhrashtachar ko kadaapi nahin chunegaa
 i once again call upon you that, as you have cleaned your house and neighborhood in the festival of Diwali, in the same way, we can make it successful by putting our full sacrifice in this Mahayagya
 itane bade desh main, itani badi safai ke mahaparv main asuvidha ko dhyaan main na rakhte hue aaie sabhi shuchita kii diwali manaaen, puure vishwa ko bharat kii is eemaandaaree kaa utsav dikhaaen, puure desh main pramanikta kaa parv manaaen jisase bhrashtachar par lagaam lag sake, kaale dhan par nakel kas sake, jaali noton kaa khel khilne waalon ko nestnabud kar sake, jisase ki desh kaa dhan garibon ke kaam aa sake, har eemaandaar naagarik ko desh kii sampannataa main uski uchit hissedari mil sake, aane vaali peedi garv se apana jivan ji sake
 i want to take this fight against corruption further with the help of 125 crore countrymen with full confidence for your cooperation
 mujhe vishwaas he aapkaa saath, aapkaa sahyog aane vaali pidiyon ke liye prerak banegaa
 i once again express my heartfelt gratitude to you
 bharat mata kii jai

 Despite all these arrangements, if our honest countrymen suffered, then experience shows that the common citizen of this country is never left behind to sacrifice and suffer for the good of the country
 jab main sunata hum ki koi garib vidhwaa LPG sabsidi chhodane main aage aati he, yah tyaag ek ritred skool teacher main bhi paaya jaataa he jab wo pension se svachh bharat kosh main yogadan dene ko aage aata he, jab ham ye sunate hai ki garib adivasee maa kaa bakrii bechakar shauchalay banane ke liye paise laga detii he, ek faujee kaa apane gaanv ko svachh gaanv banane ke liye sattaavan hazaar rupee kaa daan dene ke liye aage aata he
 i have seen that the common citizen of the country has only one desire that he is ready to do anything - just welfare of the country
 atah bhrashtachar, kaala dhan, jaali note or aatankwaad ke khilaaf jang main ham log thodi si kathinaayee vah bhi kuch dinon ke liye to jhel hi sakate hai
 i fully believe that every citizen of the country will stand together against corruption in this Mahayagya of purity
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyo, After the festival of Diwali, now in this festival of sincerity, in this festival of authenticity, you raise your hands high
 meraa puraa vishwaas he ki desh ke sabhi raajnneetik dal, rajnatik kaaryakarta, saamaajik or shaikshanik sansthaaen, media sahit samaaj ke sabhi varg se is mahaan kaary main sarkaar se bhi zyada bad chadh kar bhaag lenge, sakaaratmak bhoomika adaa karenge or is kaary ko safal bana kar hi rahenge
 My dear countrymen, ye baaten jab main aapke samaksh rakh rahaa hum, isi samay sarkaar ke alag-alag vibhaagon ko bhi jaankaree ho rahi he, bank ho, post offis ho, railway ho, aspataal ho, unke adhikariyon ko bhi is vishay kii isse pehle koi jaankaree nahin mili he
 Because confidentiality was very important in this work
 aisi sthiti main reserve bank, sabhi banks or post offis ko kam samay main bahut sari vyavastha kerani he
 There will be some time in this system
 isliye reserve bank ne yah faisla liya he ki 9 navambar ko sabhi bank public kaary ke liye band rahenge
 Citizens will be inconvenienced
 meraa puraa bharosa he ki bank or post offis main kaam karne vaale sabhi saathi desh hit main is pavitra kaary ko safaltaapurvak paripurna karenge
 In the past, they have shown this by doing this
 meraa janata-janardan se itnaa hi aagrah he ki sabhi naagarik dhairya rakhte hue sabhi banks or post offis adhikariyon ke saath sahyog karen, yahi meri unase aagrah or binati he
 Sisters and brothers, samay-samay par mudravyavastha ko dhyaan main rakhkar reserve bank, centre sarkaar kii sahmati se nae adhik mulya ke note ko cirkulation main laata rahaa he
 In 2014, the Reserve Bank sent a proposal for a currency note of 5,000 and 10,000 rupees to the government, which was rejected by our government after deliberations
 ab is puri prakriya main reserve bank dwaara 2,000 rupee ke nae note ke prastaav ko sweekaar kiya gaya he
 The completely redesigned 500 rupees and new rupee notes of 2,000 rupees will now be brought in circulation
 reserve bank apane pichley anubhavon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue, karency cirkulation main adhik mulya ke noton kaa hissaa ab ek seemaa ke andar hi rahe iske liye reserve bank aavashyak prabandh karegaa
 Finally my dear countrymen main yah doharaana chahta hum ki kisi desh ke itihaas main aise kshan aate hai jab har vyakti yah mahasoos karata he ki use bhi us kshan kaa hissaa bananaa he
 He too has to contribute in the national interest, in nation building
 parantu aise kshan har kisi kii jindagi main gine chune hi aate hai
 Today, time is again giving us an opportunity
 har saamaanya naagarik bhrashtachar, kaala dhan, jaali note ke khilaaf is mahayajna main , is ladaai main apana yogadan de saktaa he
 Brothers and brothers, the more cooperation you get in this process, the more successful the purification will be
 desh ke liye yah chintaa kaa kaaran tha ki bhrashtachar or kaale dhan ko jivan kaa ek sahaj hissaa maan liya gaya tha
 This thinking is eating our political, social, and administrative life like a termite
 shashan vyavastha kaa koi bhi ang is dimak se achoota nahin he
 The comments samay-samay par hamane dekha he ki bharat ke saamaanya jan maanas ko agar bhrashtachar or kuch dinon kii asuvidha main se ek ko chunanaa ho, to vah behichak, main kahata hum behichak mere desh kaa eemaandaar naagarik asuvidha ko to chunegaa lekin bhrashtachar ko kadaapi nahin chunegaa
 i once again call upon you that, as you have cleaned your house and neighborhood in the festival of Diwali, in the same way, we can make it successful by putting our full sacrifice in this Mahayagya
 itane bade desh main, itani badi safai ke mahaparv main asuvidha ko dhyaan main na rakhte hue aaie sabhi shuchita kii diwali manaaen, puure vishwa ko bharat kii is eemaandaaree kaa utsav dikhaaen, puure desh main pramanikta kaa parv manaaen jisase bhrashtachar par lagaam lag sake, kaale dhan par nakel kas sake, jaali noton kaa khel khilne waalon ko nestnabud kar sake, jisase ki desh kaa dhan garibon ke kaam aa sake, har eemaandaar naagarik ko desh kii sampannataa main uski uchit hissedari mil sake, aane vaali peedi garv se apana jivan ji sake
 i want to take this fight against corruption further with the help of 125 crore countrymen with full confidence for your cooperation
 mujhe vishwaas he aapkaa saath, aapkaa sahyog aane vaali pidiyon ke liye prerak banegaa
 i once again express my heartfelt gratitude to you
 bharat mata kii jai
 Brothers and sisters, desh ko bhrashtachar or kaale dhan rupi dimak se mukt karaane ke liye ek or sakht kadam uthaanaa jaruri ho gaya he

 in saare intazaam ke baavjood hamaare eemaandaar deshavaasiyon ko agar takalif kaa saamana karnaa padaa to anubhav yah bataata he ki is desh kaa saamaanya naagarik desh kii bhalaai ke liye tyaag karne or kathinaayee sahane ke liye kabhi bhi peeche nahin rahata he
 When i hear that a poor widow comes forward to give up LPG subsidy, this sacrifice is also found in a retired school teacher when he comes forward to contribute to the Swachh Bharat Kosh from pension, when we hear that the poor tribals The mother's goat sells money to build toilets, a soldier comes forward to donate 57 thousand rupees to make his village a clean village
 maine to yah dekha he ki desh ke saamaanya naagarik kii ek hi tamanna he ki vah kuch bhi kar guzarane ko taiyaar he – bas desh kaa kalyaan ho
 Therefore, in the war against corruption, black money, counterfeit notes and terrorism, we can face some difficulty even for a few days
 meraa puraa vishwaas he ki desh kaa prayek naagarik bhrashtachar ke khilaaf shuchita ke is mahayajna main milakar khadaa hoga
 My dear countrymen, diwali ke parv ke baad, ab eemaandaaree ke is utsav main, pramanikta ke is parv main aap bad chadh kar haath bataaen
 i fully believe that all political parties, political activists, social and educational institutions of the country, including all sections of society, including the media, will participate more actively in this great work than the government, play a positive role and make this work successful
 Will continue to do it
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, When i am putting these things in front of you, at the same time, different departments of the government are also getting information, be it bank, post office, railway, hospital, even their officials have no information before this
 Is received
 kyonki is kaam main gopneeyata bahut hi aavashyak thi
 In such a situation, the Reserve Bank, all banks and post offices have to make a lot of arrangements in a short time
 is vyavastha main kuch samay to jayega
 Therefore, the Reserve Bank has decided that on 9 November all banks will remain closed for public works
 nagarikon ko asuvidha hogi
 i am confident that all the colleagues working in banks and post offices will successfully complete this sacred work in the interest of the country
 bhootkaal main unhone ye karke dikhaaya he
 i request the Janata Janardan so much that all citizens should be patient and cooperate with all banks and post office officers, this is my request and request
 bahano or bhaaiyo, From time to time, the Reserve Bank has been bringing in circulation of new high denomination notes with the consent of the Central Government
 2014 main reserve bank ne 5,000 or 10,000 rupee ke karency note kaa prastaav sarkaar ko bheja tha jise hamaari sarkaar ne vichaar-vimarsh ke baad asweekaar kar diya tha

 puri tarah se nae taur par dijin kiye gaye 500 rupee or 2,000 rupee ke nae karency note ab cirkulation main laayaa jayega
 In view of the past experiences of the Reserve Bank, the Reserve Bank will make necessary arrangements to ensure that the denomination of high denomination notes is now within a limit
 ant main mere pyaare deshavaasiyo i want to reiterate that there are moments in the history of a country when every person realizes that they too have to be a part of that moment
 use bhi raashtra hit main, raashtra nirmaan main apana yogadan dena he
 But such moments only come to be counted in everyone's life
 aaj samay hamen phir se ek avasar de rahaa he
 Every ordinary citizen can contribute in this fight against corruption, black money, fake currency
 bahano or bhaaiyo aapse is prakriya main jitna sahyog milegaa, shuddhikaran utana hi safal hoga
 It was a cause of concern for the country that corruption and black money were considered an easy part of life
 yah soch aaj hamaare rajnatik, saamaajik, or prashasnic jivan ko dimak kii tarah khaae ja rahaa he
 No part of the governance system is untouched by this termite
 tippaniyan From time to time, we have seen that if the general public mind of India has to choose one of corruption and inconvenience for a few days, then it is unheard of, i say, it is the unflinching citizen of my country will choose the inconvenience, but never corruption Will choose aapse main phir ek baar aahvaan karata hum ki aaie jaise aapane diwali ke parv main apane ghar or aas pados kii safai kii, vaise hi safai ke kaam ko aage badhaate hue, ham is mahayajna main apni purnahuti daalkar ise safal banaaie
 In view of the inconvenience in the great cause of such a big cleanliness, in such a big country, let us all celebrate Diwali of purity, show this faithfulness of India to the whole world, celebrate the festival of authenticity in the whole country so that corruption can be curbed, To crack down on black money, to enable those who play the game of fake notes, so that the money of the country can be used for the poor, every honest citizen should be successful in the country's prosperity Could not get a fair share, future generations proud to live your life
 main aap sabake sahyog ke liye puure vishwaas ke saath sava sau karod deshavaasiyon ki madad se bhrashtachar ke khilaaf is ladaai ko or aage le janaa chahta hum
 i am sure your support, your cooperation will be inspiring for generations to come
 main phir ek baar aapkaa hriday se aabhaar vyakt karata hum
 Long live Mother India

 Despite all these arrangements, if our honest countrymen suffered, then experience shows that the common citizen of this country is never left behind to sacrifice and suffer for the good of the country
 jab main sunata hum ki koi garib vidhwaa LPG sabsidi chhodane main aage aati he, yah tyaag ek ritred skool teacher main bhi paaya jaataa he jab wo pension se svachh bharat kosh main yogadan dene ko aage aata he, jab ham ye sunate hai ki garib adivasee maa kaa bakrii bechakar shauchalay banane ke liye paise laga detii he, ek faujee kaa apane gaanv ko svachh gaanv banane ke liye sattaavan hazaar rupee kaa daan dene ke liye aage aata he
 i have seen that the common citizen of the country has only one desire that he is ready to do anything - just welfare of the country
 atah bhrashtachar, kaala dhan, jaali note or aatankwaad ke khilaaf jang main ham log thodi si kathinaayee vah bhi kuch dinon ke liye to jhel hi sakate hai
 i fully believe that every citizen of the country will stand together against corruption in this Mahayagya of purity
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyo, After the festival of Diwali, now in this festival of sincerity, in this festival of authenticity, you raise your hands high
 meraa puraa vishwaas he ki desh ke sabhi raajnneetik dal, rajnatik kaaryakarta, saamaajik or shaikshanik sansthaaen, media sahit samaaj ke sabhi varg se is mahaan kaary main sarkaar se bhi zyada bad chadh kar bhaag lenge, sakaaratmak bhoomika adaa karenge or is kaary ko safal bana kar hi rahenge
 My dear countrymen, ye baaten jab main aapke samaksh rakh rahaa hum, isi samay sarkaar ke alag-alag vibhaagon ko bhi jaankaree ho rahi he, bank ho, post offis ho, railway ho, aspataal ho, unke adhikariyon ko bhi is vishay kii isse pehle koi jaankaree nahin mili he
 Because confidentiality was very important in this work
 aisi sthiti main reserve bank, sabhi banks or post offis ko kam samay main bahut sari vyavastha kerani he
 There will be some time in this system
 isliye reserve bank ne yah faisla liya he ki 9 navambar ko sabhi bank public kaary ke liye band rahenge
 Citizens will be inconvenienced
 meraa puraa bharosa he ki bank or post offis main kaam karne vaale sabhi saathi desh hit main is pavitra kaary ko safaltaapurvak paripurna karenge
 In the past, they have shown this by doing this
 meraa janata-janardan se itnaa hi aagrah he ki sabhi naagarik dhairya rakhte hue sabhi banks or post offis adhikariyon ke saath sahyog karen, yahi meri unase aagrah or binati he
 Sisters and brothers, samay-samay par mudravyavastha ko dhyaan main rakhkar reserve bank, centre sarkaar kii sahmati se nae adhik mulya ke note ko cirkulation main laata rahaa he
 In 2014, the Reserve Bank sent a proposal for a currency note of 5,000 and 10,000 rupees to the government, which was rejected by our government after deliberations
 ab is puri prakriya main reserve bank dwaara 2,000 rupee ke nae note ke prastaav ko sweekaar kiya gaya he
 The completely redesigned 500 rupees and new rupee notes of 2,000 rupees will now be brought in circulation
 reserve bank apane pichley anubhavon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue, karency cirkulation main adhik mulya ke noton kaa hissaa ab ek seemaa ke andar hi rahe iske liye reserve bank aavashyak prabandh karegaa
 Finally my dear countrymen main yah doharaana chahta hum ki kisi desh ke itihaas main aise kshan aate hai jab har vyakti yah mahasoos karata he ki use bhi us kshan kaa hissaa bananaa he
 He too has to contribute in the national interest, in nation building
 parantu aise kshan har kisi kii jindagi main gine chune hi aate hai
 Today, time is again giving us an opportunity
 har saamaanya naagarik bhrashtachar, kaala dhan, jaali note ke khilaaf is mahayajna main , is ladaai main apana yogadan de saktaa he
 Brothers and brothers, the more cooperation you get in this process, the more successful the purification will be
 desh ke liye yah chintaa kaa kaaran tha ki bhrashtachar or kaale dhan ko jivan kaa ek sahaj hissaa maan liya gaya tha
 This thinking is eating our political, social, and administrative life like a termite
 shashan vyavastha kaa koi bhi ang is dimak se achoota nahin he
 The comments samay-samay par hamane dekha he ki bharat ke saamaanya jan maanas ko agar bhrashtachar or kuch dinon kii asuvidha main se ek ko chunanaa ho, to vah behichak, main kahata hum behichak mere desh kaa eemaandaar naagarik asuvidha ko to chunegaa lekin bhrashtachar ko kadaapi nahin chunegaa
 i once again call upon you that, as you have cleaned your house and neighborhood in the festival of Diwali, in the same way, we can make it successful by putting our full sacrifice in this Mahayagya
 itane bade desh main, itani badi safai ke mahaparv main asuvidha ko dhyaan main na rakhte hue aaie sabhi shuchita kii diwali manaaen, puure vishwa ko bharat kii is eemaandaaree kaa utsav dikhaaen, puure desh main pramanikta kaa parv manaaen jisase bhrashtachar par lagaam lag sake, kaale dhan par nakel kas sake, jaali noton kaa khel khilne waalon ko nestnabud kar sake, jisase ki desh kaa dhan garibon ke kaam aa sake, har eemaandaar naagarik ko desh kii sampannataa main uski uchit hissedari mil sake, aane vaali peedi garv se apana jivan ji sake
 i want to take this fight against corruption further with the help of 125 crore countrymen with full confidence for your cooperation
 mujhe vishwaas he aapkaa saath, aapkaa sahyog aane vaali pidiyon ke liye prerak banegaa
 i once again express my heartfelt gratitude to you
 bharat mata kii jai

 Despite all these arrangements, if our honest countrymen suffered, then experience shows that the common citizen of this country is never left behind to sacrifice and suffer for the good of the country
 jab main sunata hum ki koi garib vidhwaa LPG sabsidi chhodane main aage aati he, yah tyaag ek ritred skool teacher main bhi paaya jaataa he jab wo pension se svachh bharat kosh main yogadan dene ko aage aata he, jab ham ye sunate hai ki garib adivasee maa kaa bakrii bechakar shauchalay banane ke liye paise laga detii he, ek faujee kaa apane gaanv ko svachh gaanv banane ke liye sattaavan hazaar rupee kaa daan dene ke liye aage aata he
 i have seen that the common citizen of the country has only one desire that he is ready to do anything - just welfare of the country
 atah bhrashtachar, kaala dhan, jaali note or aatankwaad ke khilaaf jang main ham log thodi si kathinaayee vah bhi kuch dinon ke liye to jhel hi sakate hai
 i fully believe that every citizen of the country will stand together against corruption in this Mahayagya of purity
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyo, After the festival of Diwali, now in this festival of sincerity, in this festival of authenticity, you raise your hands high
 meraa puraa vishwaas he ki desh ke sabhi raajnneetik dal, rajnatik kaaryakarta, saamaajik or shaikshanik sansthaaen, media sahit samaaj ke sabhi varg se is mahaan kaary main sarkaar se bhi zyada bad chadh kar bhaag lenge, sakaaratmak bhoomika adaa karenge or is kaary ko safal bana kar hi rahenge
 My dear countrymen, ye baaten jab main aapke samaksh rakh rahaa hum, isi samay sarkaar ke alag-alag vibhaagon ko bhi jaankaree ho rahi he, bank ho, post offis ho, railway ho, aspataal ho, unke adhikariyon ko bhi is vishay kii isse pehle koi jaankaree nahin mili he
 Because confidentiality was very important in this work
 aisi sthiti main reserve bank, sabhi banks or post offis ko kam samay main bahut sari vyavastha kerani he
 There will be some time in this system
 isliye reserve bank ne yah faisla liya he ki 9 navambar ko sabhi bank public kaary ke liye band rahenge
 Citizens will be inconvenienced
 meraa puraa bharosa he ki bank or post offis main kaam karne vaale sabhi saathi desh hit main is pavitra kaary ko safaltaapurvak paripurna karenge
 In the past, they have shown this by doing this
 meraa janata-janardan se itnaa hi aagrah he ki sabhi naagarik dhairya rakhte hue sabhi banks or post offis adhikariyon ke saath sahyog karen, yahi meri unase aagrah or binati he
 Sisters and brothers, samay-samay par mudravyavastha ko dhyaan main rakhkar reserve bank, centre sarkaar kii sahmati se nae adhik mulya ke note ko cirkulation main laata rahaa he
 In 2014, the Reserve Bank sent a proposal for a currency note of 5,000 and 10,000 rupees to the government, which was rejected by our government after deliberations
 ab is puri prakriya main reserve bank dwaara 2,000 rupee ke nae note ke prastaav ko sweekaar kiya gaya he
 The completely redesigned 500 rupees and new rupee notes of 2,000 rupees will now be brought in circulation
 reserve bank apane pichley anubhavon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue, karency cirkulation main adhik mulya ke noton kaa hissaa ab ek seemaa ke andar hi rahe iske liye reserve bank aavashyak prabandh karegaa
 Finally my dear countrymen main yah doharaana chahta hum ki kisi desh ke itihaas main aise kshan aate hai jab har vyakti yah mahasoos karata he ki use bhi us kshan kaa hissaa bananaa he
 He too has to contribute in the national interest, in nation building
 parantu aise kshan har kisi kii jindagi main gine chune hi aate hai
 Today, time is again giving us an opportunity
 har saamaanya naagarik bhrashtachar, kaala dhan, jaali note ke khilaaf is mahayajna main , is ladaai main apana yogadan de saktaa he
 Brothers and brothers, the more cooperation you get in this process, the more successful the purification will be
 desh ke liye yah chintaa kaa kaaran tha ki bhrashtachar or kaale dhan ko jivan kaa ek sahaj hissaa maan liya gaya tha
 This thinking is eating our political, social, and administrative life like a termite
 shashan vyavastha kaa koi bhi ang is dimak se achoota nahin he
 The comments samay-samay par hamane dekha he ki bharat ke saamaanya jan maanas ko agar bhrashtachar or kuch dinon kii asuvidha main se ek ko chunanaa ho, to vah behichak, main kahata hum behichak mere desh kaa eemaandaar naagarik asuvidha ko to chunegaa lekin bhrashtachar ko kadaapi nahin chunegaa
 i once again call upon you that, as you have cleaned your house and neighborhood in the festival of Diwali, in the same way, we can make it successful by putting our full sacrifice in this Mahayagya
 itane bade desh main, itani badi safai ke mahaparv main asuvidha ko dhyaan main na rakhte hue aaie sabhi shuchita kii diwali manaaen, puure vishwa ko bharat kii is eemaandaaree kaa utsav dikhaaen, puure desh main pramanikta kaa parv manaaen jisase bhrashtachar par lagaam lag sake, kaale dhan par nakel kas sake, jaali noton kaa khel khilne waalon ko nestnabud kar sake, jisase ki desh kaa dhan garibon ke kaam aa sake, har eemaandaar naagarik ko desh kii sampannataa main uski uchit hissedari mil sake, aane vaali peedi garv se apana jivan ji sake
 i want to take this fight against corruption further with the help of 125 crore countrymen with full confidence for your cooperation
 mujhe vishwaas he aapkaa saath, aapkaa sahyog aane vaali pidiyon ke liye prerak banegaa
 i once again express my heartfelt gratitude to you
 bharat mata kii jai

 When i hear that a poor widow comes forward to give up LPG subsidy, this sacrifice is also found in a retired school teacher when he comes forward to contribute to the Swachh Bharat Kosh from pension, when we hear that the poor tribals The mother's goat sells money to build toilets, a soldier comes forward to donate 57 thousand rupees to make his village a clean village
