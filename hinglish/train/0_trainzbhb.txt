 in sabhi filmon main jo ek cheez kaaman thi wo the produsar rahul mitra
 Review: Dear Maya, which is full of weak script and poor suspense, the recently released film 'dear Maya' is also produced by Rahul Mitra
 film 'dear maaya' ko mil rahe rispons se rahul kaaphi khush hai
 Producer Rahul Mitra told in an interview - 'I have been in the industry for more than 8 years, i have been a fan of content since the beginning, good films are good scripts people sniff without even seeing the film
 bataur produsar mujhe pataa tha ki 'dear maaya' kii kahani kaaphi antertaning hai
 Films like 'aaj Jab' Bahubali 'are earning a profit of up to Rs 1500 crore in Bollywood, which has plagued the directors and producers
 kam bajet main baniin film 'dear maaya' bhi acchhee kamai kar rahi he
 In such a situation, the success of the film for producer Rahul Mitra is a bit different
 rahul ne bataaya- 'ye 100 karod kii baat nahin he
 Sometimes the budget makes and spoils films
 chhalati umr kii heroinon ko bhi milane chahie lead rolls: manisha koiralaagar kisi film kii cost of production hi 80 karod he or wo 100 karod kii kamai karti he to kya phayda
 'dear Maya' is made in the Right Budget
 kisi bhi film kii landig cost sahi honi chahie, ek tay bajet he, jo apni cost ricover kar le, phir uske upar agar kuch profit hota he usase film kaa saxes rate pataa lagata he
 With the third installment of Saheb Biwi and Gangster Franchise, Rahul will be among the fans very soon

 khoonkhaar aatanki masood ajahar ko vaishvik aatanki ghoshit karne ko lekar america or china aamane-saamne aa gaye hai
 While many countries including the US, France, Britain and India are making all efforts to include terrorist organization jaish-e-mohammed's master Masood Azhar in the list of global terrorists, China and Pakistan are trying to protect him
 china masood ko vaishvik aatanki ghoshit karne ke antarrashtriya prayaason ko lagaataar vifal kar rahaa he
 China has used veto power four times so far to save Masood
 ab jab america masood ajahar ko vaishvik aatanki kii suchi main shaamil karne ke liye suraksha parishad main phir se prastaav laa rahaa he, to china baukhalaayaa hua he or chetavanee di he
 China has agreed to confront the US for terrorist Masood Azhar
 usne america par masood ajahar ke khilaaf jabaran prastaav laane kaa aarope bhi lagaaya he
 However, this proposal of America also has the support of France and Britain
 chini videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa geng shuang ne kaha ki america 1267 sanctions cameti ko bypass karke sidhe suraksha parishad main prastaav laa rahaa he
 This is not the right way to resolve the issue through dialogue
 beijing main videsh mantralay kii media brifing ke dauraan chini pravaktaa ne kaha ki america kaa yah kadam suraksha parishad kii ahm aatankwaad-rodhi 1267 sanctions cameti ke adhikaar ko kam karne vaala he
 He said, 'this is not the right way to bring the proposal and is not in line with global solidarity
 isse yah mudda sirf jatil hi hoga
 So we appeal to America to act with caution and avoid forcibly moving the proposal
 ' isse pehle masood ajahar ko vaishvik aatanki ghoshit karaane kii koshishon par chaar baar adnga laga chukaa he
 Let us tell you that after the terrorist attack on CRPF convoy in Pulwama, Jammu and Kashmir, America, France and Britain had brought a resolution in the Security Council to declare Masood Azhar as a global terrorist
 haalanki china ne masood ajahar ko vaishvik aatanki ghoshit karne kii koshish par adnga laga diya tha
 The US, France and Britain reacted strongly to this
 pulavama aatanki hamale main siarpief ke 40 jawan shahid ho gaye the
 Masood Azhar's organization jaish-e-mohammed took responsibility for this terrorist attack
 iske baad bhartiya vayusena ne pakistan ke balakot main ghuskar jaish-e-mohammad ke aatanki thikaanon par air strike kii thi
 a lot of terrorists are being killed in this
 vahiin, bhartiya vayusena kii is karrwai se baukhalaaye pakistan bhartiya kshetra main hawaii hamalaa kiya tha, jiskaa bharatan bhi munhtod jawaab diya tha or pakistan ke epa-16 ladaaku vimaan ko maar giraaya tha
 The United States sent the proposal directly to the Security Council for the first time, UN sources told PTI that for the first time on Wednesday, the United States, Britain and France sent a draft proposal directly to the Security Council to put Masood Azhar's name on the black list
 aisa prastaav anaapatti sambandhi kisi praavdhaan ke tahat nahin aata
 If Masood Azhar is included in the list of global terrorists, his travel will be banned and his assets will be confiscated

 Like other seats here, criticism of JDU does not mean praise of BJP, here is discussion of Pappu Yadav
 ‘pappu yadav jindabad he, uske saamne koi nahin

 'madhepura is not a big city and after the new delimitation, it was no longer even of Gop, as it was said earlier

 vishvavidhyalay ke vakil ne yachika kaa virodh karte hue kaha tha ki elelbi degree paathyakram ek peshewar vishay he or usamen niyamit upasthiti jaruri he
 The court agreed with the lawyer's claim that LLB is a special professional subject, where it cannot be relaxed under the Bar Council rules

 jaise hi is faisle kii ghoshnaa kii gai, shuukravaar ko hone vaali baithkon ke blueprint ko ikattha karke vittiya aparaadh ko dekhne vaali iskar vibhaag or pravartan nideshaalay jaisi agenciyon se saajha kiya gaya
 The comments sutron kii maane to dow raghuram rajan bhi apane kaarykaal ke dauraan may or agast main isse judi charchaaon main shaamil hue the
 It is also being claimed that due to the change in the leadership of the central bank, the delay in printing of 2000 rupee note was necessary
 nae note ko bazaar main laane kaa faisla kathith taur par june main hi le liya gaya tha taaki puraane note band hote hi nae note aa jaaen
 The design and security features of the note were also stamped by PM and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley
 lekin nae noton par arabiai governor ke hastakshar chahie the isliye urjit patel ke daftar aane se pehle yah kaam thodi der ke liye atak gaya tha
 All other requirements were met and notes with Patel's signature were sent for printing as soon as Patel arrived
 bataa den ki notebandi se hui nagdi kii baari kami ne arabiai ko aalochakon ke katghare main khadaa kar diya he
 The central bank is being accused that they did not have any clear guidelines to handle the situation
 lekin arabiai governor ne safai dete hue yah sabit karne kii koshish kii he ki kendriya bank ke paas is baat kii sirf jaankaree hi nahin thi, balki unhone maheenon se chal rahi taiyaari ke saath apana role nibhaayaa he
 According to sources, Dr
 Raghuram Rajan also participated in discussions related to it during his tenure in May and August
 yah bhi daawa kiya ja rahaa he ki kendriya bank ke netritv main aae badlaav kii vajah se 2000 rupye ke note kii chapai main thodi deree jaruri hui
 The decision to bring the new note into the market was reportedly taken in June itself so that new notes would come in as soon as the old notes were closed
 piem or vitt mantri arun jetali ne note ke dizin or suraksha fitures par muhar bhi laga di thi
 But the new notes required the signature of the RBI governor, so the work was stuck for a while before Urjit Patel came to office
 baaki sabhi jaruraton ko puraa kar liya gaya tha or patel ke aate hi unke hastakshar ke saath note chapai ke liye bhej die gayi the
 Let us know that the huge cash deficit due to demonetisation has put the RBI in the dock of critics
 kendriya bank par aarope lagaaya ja rahaa he ki paristhiti ko sanbhaalane ke liye unke paas kisi bhi tarah ke saaf disha nirdesh nahin the
 But the RBI Governor has tried to prove by clarifying that the central bank was not only aware of this, but he has played his role with the preparations that have been going on for months

 Election campaign was seen all over the state
 chunaav prachaaron main baari-bharkam raashi kharch hoti thi
 On many trains, rickshaws used to campaign with loud speakers
 paison kii barbaadi or noton ke dam par vot kharidne kii baaten saamne aane par chunaav ayog ne kuch kathor kadam uthaane shuru kiye
 This time the Election Commission took a number of strict steps for the sake of fair elections
 is baar chunaav kharch kii seemaa 28 lakh rakhi gai he
 Due to the strictness of the Election Commission, the electoral environment of the past few years has changed completely now
 haalanki isaki ek vajah teji se badal rahi digital pravriti or badhati mahangaai bhi ho sakati he kyonki ab chunaavon main maidani prachaar se zyada prachaar anya madhyamon ke jariye hota he
 Apart from mobile messaging, campaign calls, there is a lot of publicity on Facebook, Twitter and whatsapp these days
 is puri kavayad main nuksaan hua un chhapaakhaanon or vyapaariyon kaa jo chunaav samagriyon kaa bijness karte the
 Today we are getting you familiar with some such election materials which are now rarely seen
 jhande / jhandiyarali or jansabhaon se pehle kaarykram sthal ke aasapaas ke ilaakon main rajnatik partiyon ke kaaryakarta jhande or jhandiyaan lagaate hai
 These days, due to limited electoral spending, it is seen around the venue or else there was a time when the election came, the entire city was flooded with flags
 batan stikar / billaabton stikar or billon kaa sabase zyada craij bacchon ke bheetar hua karata tha
 Children running behind election vehicles used to collect various types of stickers and badges
 netaaon ke kapadon par bhi chunavi billaa najar aata tha
 It has now disappeared in today's era
 haalanki desh ke pradhanmantri narendra modi aksar bijepi kaa billaa lagaae chunavi reliyon main najar aate rahe hai
 The political parties in Pampallet, along with their electoral agenda, sought to win the candidate
 chunavi gaadiyaan alag-alag ilaakon main gum-gum pamplate baanta karti thim
 Now their number has also become very limited
 topi / mukhutachunavi tapiyaan bhi bacchon ke saath-saath yuvaaon ko lubhaane kaa kaam karti thim
 They used to be very suitable for the parties in the summer election campaigns
 iske alaava mukhute bhi kaaphi prachlit hai
 Parties have been using masks of their big leaders in election campaign too
 narendra modi or rahul gandhi ke mukhute in dinon kaaphi najar aate hai
 Cutouts cutouts were used at election rallies and promotional vehicles
 lekin ab inaki jagah flax priting ne le lee he
 Cutouts tended to be expensive as well as very demanding, whereas flakes tend to be easy to carry with being cheap
 kii-ring / belt / pen / tii-shart / chaataa / mobile coverpahale chunaavon main partiyaan apane prachaar ke liye tarah-tarah kii upyogi chizon par chunaav-chinh yaa pratyaashee kii tasviir lagaakar prachaar kiya karti thim
 These things were ordered keeping in mind the atmosphere and the weather
 kii-ring, belt, pen, tii-shart, chaataa or mobile cover jaisi chijen rajnatik partiyaan baantati rahati thim
 Although some of these things are still visible, but now their use has become limited
 fatka / mafalrafatka chunaav prachaar ke liye netaaon kaa sabase pasandida hota he
 Leaders of almost all the parties will be seen hanging around their neck with their election symbols during the election campaign
 haalanki fatke kaa fishan abhi kaayam he
 Similar mufflers are evergreen

 Shot where worn around the neck then hand band in the wrist of the hand

 a false case of rape was registered by a village woman on 38-year-old public teacher Ramlal Akhande here
 aarope lagane ke baad raamalaal ke liye sab kuch badal gaya
 Those who used to see him with respect, now his hatred was dripping in their eyes
 akhabaaron main ‘balaatkaari janshikshak’ heading se khub khabaren chhapin or gaanvvaale hi nahin unke apano ne bhi unase munh mode liya
 Ramlal explains, "not only did i dare to go out of the house for many days, the idea of suicide also came, but the family was with them, so the courage remained
" ’’ is maamle main police ne tatparta dikhaate hue diene jaanch karvaa lee, jisamen sabit ho gaya ki un par laga aarope jhootha he
 The stigma on his forehead was washed away and everything was normal

 The fear of women has come to dominate them so that if the voice of the woman is heard even on mobile, they get nervous
 yahaan tak ki bas main kisi mahila ke bagal kii seat par bhi nahin baithte
 Burhanpur Superintendent of Police Avinash Sharma says, "on January 19, Vayjayanti Manoj Yaduvanshi of Peretha village lodged a complaint that Ramlal Akhande had raped her last night
" ’’ lekin sharma ko ghatnakram sandehaaspad laga
 The reason for this was that Vayjayanti's husband Manoj was in jail since December last on charges of raping a girl from Yaduvanshi village
 raamalaal us balaatkaar peedit ladki ke kaaka hai
 At the beginning of the police it was felt that this charge has been made with the intention of putting pressure on the other side
 isiilie aarope lagane vaali mahila kaa medical pareekshan karwaane ke saath-saath raamalaal kaa bhi diene test karavaaya gaya
 No semen was found on the woman's body or clothes
 yah report raamalaal kii begunaahi ke liye paryaapt thi
 Khaknar police station in-charge Sanjeev Nayan Sharma says, "after this report the false rape case against Ramlal was eliminated
 juthi report darj karne ke aarope main vaijayanti yaduwanshi, uske jeth anand singh yaduwanshi or bhai ramswaroop ke khilaaf ipisi or atrocity act ke tahat maamla darj kar liya gaya
 "but 50-year-old Roopkishore Agarwal of Indore did not have as good luck as Ramlal
 unki kirayedar 33 varshiya chanchal or sunil rathore ne pichhali 26 disambar ko palasia thane main un par balaatkaar kaa maamla darj karavaaya tha
 In this case, the police arrested Agarwal and sent him to jail without knowing his side
 agarwal kii patni manjula bataati hai, ‘‘ve cheekh-chikhakar kehete rahe ki ve begunaah hai, unka diene test karavaaya jaae lekin police ne unki ek nahin suni

 Additional Sessions Judge Savita Dubey was extremely angry over the false rape complaint and said, "some people are taking wrong advantage after Delhi gang rape
" isse asal peedit kii bhaavana ko thes pahunch sakati he
 The judge also ordered a trial against Chanchal, who made the false accusation
 lekin adaalat se mili clin chit bhi agarwal ko sadame se baahar nahin nikaal pai or unhone 17 march ko faansee lagaakar aatmahatya kar lee
 In the suicide note too, he blamed Chanchal and Sunil Rathore for his death

 He had taken a loan from Agarwal to buy a car but he was neither paying the rent of the house nor paying the loan
 jab agarwal ne paison ke liye dabaav banaaya or makaan khaali karne ko kaha to rathore dampati ne yah shadyantr rachaa

 ek aise jaalsaaj kii kahani se ham aapako bataane ja rahe hai
 Who was cheating people by becoming an IPS officer
 haal main hi kai aise naam saamne aae jinhone thagi kii nai ibaarat likh di
 They include Raj Malhotra IPS, Zoya Khan IFS, Harsh Pratap Singh UNO Council Officer and Sandeep Sharma DCP, Haryana Police
 ye sab farzi he ji
 Icard also fake nem plate bhi farzi
 The badge on the uniform is also fake
 ye hai natvarlaal
 Natwarlal because he did not take advantage of his influence by being a fake government official
 balki logon ko lakhon karodon kii chapat bhi laga diya karte the
 Natwarlal number-1 turned out to be Raj Malhotra
 is shaks ne farzi ipies banakar sirf nakli ipies kii vardi hi nahin pahani balki ye baqayada puure rasookh main rahata bhi rahata tha
 When it was arrested, Bhaisahab was in full dress
 ipies kaa billaa
 The name plate on which his name was also written was Raj Malhotra
 police ke mutabik pichley kai saalon se iskaa ye gorakhdhandha jari thi
 Till now, many innocent people have been robbed in the guise of having their IPS
 magar inaki shamat tab ai jab ek ladki ne inaki police main shikaayat darj karai
 Actually, this man named Raj Malhotra used to go to a gym
 jahaan uski mulaakaat ek ladki se hui
 The two became friends because of doing gym together
 peedit ladki ek sho room main cells girl kaa kaam karti he
 While Raj Malhotra told him that he is an IPS officer
 usne khud ko uttari dilli main asipi ke pad par tainaat bataaya
 Raj Malhotra slowly befriended the girl
 is bich ek baar raaj malhotra ne peedit ladki se ek choti bacchee ko bhi milwaaya or daawa kiya ki usne is bacchee ko god le rakhaa he
 After this, the friendship of both of them deepened
 phir ek din raaj malhotra ne ladki se kaha ki wo ek ipies officer he
 He is known by his elder people
 aise main uski dost celsgirl kaa kaam kare to thik nahin lagata he
 So in the name of getting a government job, Raj Malhotra cheated the girl with Rs 1 lakh
 or paise lene ke baad raaj malhotra ne ladki se milanaa julna band kar diya
 When the girl got suspicious, she reached the accused's house
 ghar kii haalat dekhakar ladki samaj gai ki uske saath dhokhadhadi hui he
 So he immediately reached the Aman Vihar police station and filed a complaint against this fake IPS
 jiske baad police ne fouran raaj malhotra ko dhokhadhadi ke ilzaam main giraftaar kar liya
 The victim was also suspected because Raj Malhotra was seen in uniform, but never seen in a government car
 police ke mutabik raaj malhotra isse pehle 2013 main bhi farzivaade ke chakkar main ek baar pakadaa ja chukaa he
 At that time, Raj was trying to cheat by becoming a sub-inspector
 magar jail se chhutne ke baad usne apana promashan khud hi kar liya or ipies banakar logon se thagi karne laga

 " Blaming the then prime minister Rajiv Gandhi and former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Arjun Singh for absconding from the country after Warren Anderson, the main accused in the Bhopal gas tragedy, the BJP has demanded a fair probe into it

 Why does the government work under American pressure
 unhone kaha ki jis samay bhopal gas traasadee hui, us samay centre main rajeev gandhi ke netritv main congress sarkaar thi jabaki madhya pradesh main ajarun singh nit congress sarkaar thi
 It is not possible that without the permission of the Prime Minister, the person responsible for the death of 20 thousand people is made a government guest or allowed to use the government aircraft without the orders of the Chief Minister
 bhaajapa pravaktaa ne kaha ki anderson vimaan main akelaa nahin gaya hoga
 The government should clarify who was on the plane with Anderson
 unhone kaha ki anderson ke pratyrpan ke liye sarkaar raajnneetik ichha shakti kaa parichay de or traasadee main peediton ke saath dhokhaa karne ke liye congress desh kii janata se maafee maange
 Taking a dig at the Minister for Roads, Transport and Highways, Kamal Nath, Javadekar said that Union Carbide, the company responsible for the Bhopal tragedy, is Dow Chemical and what Kamal Nath has advocated for the investment of the said company and what decision the government has taken
 Also be clarified
 a post shared by Swara Bhasker (@reallyswara) on Mar 18, 2018 at 2:13pm PDTA post shared by Swara Bhasker (@reallyswara) on Apr 26, 2018 at 9:23am PDT Not much, but i can say so much about the history of at least 10 years that whenever a good man requested to get a pass in the audience gallery of the Parliament, i shrugged off
 isaki ek hi vajah thi ki kabhi bharosa hi nahin hua ki jis din kaa paas desh ke dur kone se aae kisi vyakti ko milegaa, us din sadan kii kaarywahi sthagit nahin hogi
 Postponement has become the religion of Parliament
 It is a matter of fact that whatever issue the Parliament adjourns in a session, it is not necessary that anyone will remember that issue in the next session
 taabut ghotaale se lekar bharat america parmaanu qaraar ke raste, bijepi mantriyon ke istife tak kii maang main yah ekresata aapako dikhegi
 See in the latest case that last time there was a ruckus on the land law, but this time its noise has been suppressed
 yani hamaare saansadon ne dalgat bhaavana se upar uthakar sansad thap karne kaa faisla kar liya he
 If this seems to be a violation, then you should ask privately from any party MP and he will tell you some of his optional programs during Parliament session
 to sawaal yah ki aisa kyon? vaise iske kai bade or mahatvapurn kaaran ho sakate hai
 But the reason often given is the mind to be counted here
 vah yah he ki saansadon ko bharosa ho gaya he ki agar wo sadak par, sansad ke baahar or sadan main hangaamaa karenge to unhen kawarej milegaa
 And if they will speak peacefully in the House, then their talk will not go out in public with the media
 vahiin agar sadan main parchaa faad denge, adhyaksh ke asana ke paas chale jaaenge yaa aisi koi dikhnausi harakat karenge jo camere ko priy ho to wo charchaa main aa jaaenge
 The mps are also very aware in their conscience that their jummies thrown in front of the media cameras outside the House also make a lot of news
 yani saansad samvaad ke bajaay romaanchak drishy media ko dena chaahate hai, jiske liye camere pyaase ghoomte hai
 Anyway, many times the common man forgets that even when the Parliament does not work, the Minister concerned is still answering written questions on the floor of the House
 aisa bhi nahin he ki ye prashn kam mahatv ke hote hon, lekin tivi media main inkaa zikr usee din sunne ko nahin miltaa
 Yes, if a forgotten newspaper or a news agency makes news to any of them, then the next day electronic media eyesight gets noticed
 to agar aisa ho jaae ki janpratinidhiyon ko kisi tarah yah yakeen dilaa diya jaae ki vivaad ke alaava samvaad ko bhi khabaron main waisi hi pramukhataa mil sakati he, to shaayad saansad log naa sirf dibet par amada ho jaaen, balki unamem dibet karne kii hode bhi lag jaae
 During Anna's fast on the issue of Lokpal, there was a good dialogue in the House, so one of the reasons was that the leaders knew that what they are going to speak, they will see the whole country with the eyes of the camera
 kya camera sansad ko yah bharosa dilaa paaegaa ki vah sadan kii kaarywahi dikhaane ke liye vaaki taiyaar he? philhal isaki gunjaaish nahin dikhti, kyonki aisa karnaa patrakarita ke buniyadi lakshanon se mail nahin khaataa
 On Wednesday, a 'most awaited' political entry was made by the Congress in Indian politics
 loksabhaa chunaav (lok Sabha Polls) se thik pehle priyanka gandhi wadra(priyanka Gandhi Vadra) sakriy raajnneeti main utar chuki hai or ab vah congress (congress)kii mahasachiv banaai gai hai
 Priyanka Gandhi's decision to enter active politics was approved last week when Congress President and her brother Rahul Gandhi met her in the US
 is tarah se dekha jaae to priyanka gandhi ke raajnneeti main aane kii script americamein likhi gai or vahiin par rahul gandhi ke nirdesan main is faisle par muhar lagi
 Actually, Rahul Gandhi went on a special mission to America directly from Dubai
 vah mishan tha ki priyanka gandhi wadra ko sakriy raajnneeti main aane ke liye manaanaa or yah bataanaa ki ab unke raajnneetik entry kaa sahi samay aa gaya he
 Till now Priyanka Gandhi did not have full interest in politics
 kyonki isse pehle vah aanshik taur par apane bhai rahul or maa sonia ke liye amethi or raibareli main chunaav ke samay road sho or reliyon main shaamil hoti rahi hai
 Important Congress sources told NDTV that Priyanka Gandhi Vadra had decided to enter politics only during the last two years, but there was no time limit on when she would enter politics
 apane bacchon ke saath vyast priyanka gandhi ne apni is yojana ko open rakhaa tha ki jab waisi jarurat hogi, vah apane faisle ko amali jama pahanaaengi
 But when the possibilities of an alliance with Mayawati and Akhilesh Yadav's BSP-SP in Uttar Pradesh were over, Rahul Gandhi decided that the time had come to wager on Priyanka Gandhi Vala
 yahi vajah he ki rahul gandhi or priyanka gandhi wadra ne sanyukt rajya america main mulaakaat kii or vahiin par amethi kii apni yatra kii ghoshnaa kii
 It is being told that Priyanka Gandhi Vadra will return in the first week of February
 congress ke ek ahm netaa ne kaha ki agar upi main mayawati or akhilesh ke saath gathbandhan ho jaataa to shaayad priyanka gandhi kii entry abhi nahin hoti yaa phir unki raajnneetik entry alag formet main hoti or alag timming main
 But now the Congress wants to contest all the 80 seats of UP and it is expected that it can win at least 30 of them
 is bade elaan se pehle congress das siton par jeet darj karne kaa anumaan laga rahi thi
 The party source said this
 priyanka gandhi kii raajnneeti main entry ke baad ab congress varking cameti main gandhi parivaar se teen log ho gaye hai
 Rahul Gandhi, Sonia Gandhi and now Priyanka Gandhi
 haalanki, abhi tak is baat kii pushti nahin hui he ki priyanka gandhi kahaan se chunaav ladengi
 But if sources are to be believed, Priyanka Gandhi can contest from her mother's traditional seat Rae Bareli
 bataa den ki isse pehle aisi charchaaen thim ki sonia gandhi party politics se kinaaraa kar sakati hai
 People inside the party say that 90 percent of the candidates in Priyanka Gandhi and Jyotiraditya Scindia's team will be under 50 years old and half of the candidates will be under 40 years old
 uttar pradesh main is baar congress ek alag rang rup main dikhegi
 The Congress party wants to establish its strong presence everywhere in UP
 yahi vajah he ki congress abhi is objective ke saath chal rahi he ki use apni party ko vahaan kaaphi majboot bananaa he
 People within the Congress said that after Priyanka Gandhi's entry into politics and taking over Eastern UP, Brahmin will influence voters
 unki entry se brahmanon ke vot congress kii ore honge
 Let me tell you that in UP there are 12 percent Brahmin votes
 haalanki, ab ek baat to tay he ki priyanka gandhi kii entry se congress party main ek ummid jaagi or unhen ab aisa lagane laga he ki upi kii ran main vah ab bane hue hai
 Members of the Trinamool Congress, along with BJP leader and Union Minister Babul Supriyo, were allegedly thrashed on Thursday when they along with their parents arrived at a polling station here to vote
 is ghatana ke silsile main koi giraftaar nahin hui he
 Kolkata Police is investigating the case
 matdaan karne ke liye jab babul apane abhibhavakon ke saath shobhabazar ilaake main sthit arya kanya mahavidhyalay pahunche, vahaan baari bheed ekatra ho gai
 The Union Minister of State for Urban Development faced opposition from alleged Trinamool activists
 trinmul sadasyon ne bheed ko aakarshith karne ke liye unke khilaaf 'waapas jaao, waapas jaao' kii narebaaji kii
 After this there was an argument between them
 kuch pradarshnakariyon ne aarope lagaaya ki babul us nirvachan kshetra ke matadaata nahin hai or 'maahaul ko vishakt' kar rahe the
 Babul said, 'I came here to vote as a common man and not as a minister
 mere saath koi surakshakarmi nahin tha, na hi koi bijepi kaaryakarta
 But these people started protesting on something which was not needed
 ' unhone yah aarope bhi lagaaya ki matdaan centre par koi pulicekarmi maujuud nahin tha
 The comments babul ne ek kaaryakarta ko pakad liya, jisane kathith taur par unke saath us samay galigalouj kii thi, jab vah matdaan karne ke baad booth se baahar aa rahe the
 a senior Kolkata Police official said, when Babul Supriyo arrived here to vote, some people demonstrated
 hamane suna he ki kuch logon ne unhen dhakka bhi diya
 No arrests have been made in connection with this incident
 ham maamle kii jaanch kar rahe hai
 (this news has not been edited by the NDTV team
 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he) When Babul reached the Arya Kanya Mahavidyalaya in Shobhabazar area with his parents to vote, a huge crowd gathered
 kendriya shahari vikaas rajya mantri ko kathith trinmul kaaryakartaaon ke virodh kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Trinamool members shouted 'go back, go back' against them to attract the crowd
 iske baad unke bich kahasuni hui
 Some protesters alleged that Babylon was not a voter of that constituency and was 'poisoning the atmosphere'
 babul ne kaha, 'main yahaan ek aam aadmi ke rup main matdaan karne ke liye aayaa tha, na ki mantri ke rup main
 i was not accompanied by any security personnel, nor any BJP worker
 lekin in logon ne aisi cheez par virodh shuru kar diya jisaki koi jarurat nahin thi
 He also alleged that no policemen were present at the polling station
 tippaniyan Babylon caught a worker who had allegedly abused him when he was coming out of the booth after voting
 kolkata police ke ek varisht adhikari ne kaha, jab babul supriyo matdaan karne ke liye yahaan pahunche, kuch logon ne pradarshan kiya

 com / copendncqxlol hi it's just my dad talking about a woman he wants to date supreme court ne pradhan nyaayadhish ke khilaaf shadyantr ke daavon par kaha ki jis tareeke se is sanstha se pesh aayaa ja rahaa he, ham usase naaraaz hai
 
 
 If this happens, we will not be able to work
 court ne pradhan nyaayadhish ke khilaaf shadyantr sambandhi vakil ke daavon par kaha ki is sanstha ko badnaam karne ke liye ek sochaa samajha hamalaa kiya ja rahaa he or sochaa samajha khel khelaa ja rahaa he
 The court said that four to five percent of the lawyers are those who are defaming this great institution
 saath hi kaha ‘ab samay aa gaya he ki ham khadey hon or desh ke amir evam taqatvar logon ko bataaen ki ve aisa nahin kar sakate
 a bench of Justice Arun Mishra, Justice RF Nariman and Justice Deepak Gupta were hearing the case
 saath hi court ne kaha, 'yah sab kya chal rahaa he
 People want to settle matters with the power of money
 aap jisko chaahe uski chhavi kharaab kar sakate hai
 Judges come and go, this is your institution
 santhaan ko saaf karnaa hoga
 The bench said the allegations of fixing were serious
 jab bhi bada maamla aata he to log chitthee likhane lagate hai
 Books are written in pending cases
 supreme court kisi ke dwaara remote se control nahin ho saktaa
 We will see how to investigate this matter objectively
 kisi ko bhi sachai nahin pataa
 The people of the country should know the truth
 nyaayalay ne kaha ki manamafik peeth ke samaksh sunwaayee karaane ke aarope bahut hi gambhir he or unki jaanch kii jaani chahie
 Let me tell you, the Supreme Court on Wednesday termed the claims of 'fixing' in the apex court and allegations of sexual harassment on CJI Ranjan Gogoi as 'highly sensitive' and said that it is the responsibility of the court to make the institution (court) clean So that its image is not tarnished
 nyaayamurti arun mishra kii adhyakshata vaali teen nyaayadhishon kii vishesh peeth ne kaha ki sheersh nyaayalay kii peeth main ‘phixing' ke bare main adhivaktaa utsav singh bains dwaara daakhil halafname main lagaae gaye aarope or kuch naamon kaa khulaasa bahut hi gambhir pahalu vaala he
 The bench said, "it becomes our responsibility to keep the institution (court) clean and make sure that such allegations do not tarnish the image of this institution
" 
 
 'peeth ne kaha, ‘ham jaanch karenge or fiksaron ke sakriy hone or nyaaypalika ke saath herapheri karne ke kathith daavon kii tah tak jaayenge
 If they keep doing their work then none of us will be left
 is vyavastha main phixing kii koi bhoomika nahin he
 We will examine it and take it to the final conclusion

 Senior leader of Bihar Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and former Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi on Saturday accused Chief Minister Nitish Kumar of defending 'loved ones' and implicating 'opponents' while playing the duty of opposition leader
 modi ne patna main kaha ki yahi kaaran he ki police jaanboojhkar ab tak sattadhari mahagathbandhan main shaamil jad (you) ke vidhayak or bihar krishi vishvavidhyalay main aniyamitata baratane ke aaropee purv kulapati mewaalaal choudhary, congress netaa brajesh pandeya or vyavsaayee nikhil priyadarshi ko giraftaar nahin kar rahi he
 On the other hand, the police arrest the Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer and the then SDO of Mohania, Jitendra Gupta and Bihar Staff Selection Commission (BSSC) Chairman Sudhir Kumar after reaching their house at midnight
 bhaajapa netaa ne kaha ki hakeekat he ki mukhyamantri ke ishaare par police jaanboojh kar mewaalaal choudhary se lekar brajesh pandeya tak ko isliye giraftaar nahin kar rahi he, jisase inhen adaalat se agrim jamaanat lene or saakshyon ko nasht karne kaa samay mil sake
 He said, "why should the government not arrest the accused and popular businessman Nikhil Priyadarshi even 70 days after the complaint was lodged in the 'sex scandal'?" modi ne kaha, "ucch nyaayalay ke purv nyaayadhish kii jaanch ke baad vishvavidhyalay main niyukti maamle main aniyamitata baratane ke aarope main praathmiki darj hone ke baavjood jad (you) vidhayak mewaalaal choudhary ko khulaa ghoomane kii chhot kisi mili hui he? kya mewaalaal choudhary baahar rahakar apane prabhaav kaa upyog kar saakshyon se chhedchhad nahin kar rahe hai?" unhone kaha ki agar nitish kumaar sahi main logon ko bachaate or fansaate nahin hai to phir iees adhikari jitendra gupta ko jhuthe maamle main fansaane vaale adhikariyon ke khilaaf ab tak koun si karrwai hui he?tippaniyan Modi said that Jitendra Gupta was not only proved innocent by the Patna High Court, but also quashed the FIR lodged against him

 ) The BJP leader said that the fact is that at the behest of the Chief Minister, the police is not deliberately arresting Mewalal Chaudhary from Brajesh Pandey for giving him time to get anticipatory bail from the court and destroy the evidence
 unhone kaha, "sarkaar bataae ki 'sex scandle' main shikaayat darj hone ke 70 din baad bhi aaropee or charchit vyavsaayee nikhil priyadarshi ko police ab tak giraftaar kyon nahin kar rahi he?" Modi said, "how is JD (U) MLA Mewalal Chaudhary allowed to roam free despite an FIR lodged by the former High Court judge for irregularities in the university's recruitment case? Is Mevalal Chaudhary out Not using your influence while tampering with evidence? " He said that if Nitish Kumar does not really save and implicate people, then what action has been taken against the officers who implicated IAS officer Jitendra Gupta in a false case? modi ne kaha ki jitendra gupta ko patna ucch nyaayalay ne na keval nirdosh sabit kiya, balki unke khilaaf darj praathmiki ko bhi radd kar diya
 Not only this, the court refused to accept even the petition of the state government, which went to the Supreme Court in this case

 While it seemed to me that after the unprecedented success of the film 'masaan', there will be little change, but nothing like this has happened

 chhattisgarh main sidi rajnatik daavpench hi nahin balki apane dushman ko munhtod jawaab dene ke liye bhi kargar hathiyaar sabit ho rahi he
 It is another matter that the politicians here call it dirty politics
 bijepi ho yaa congress avasar padane par donon hi dalon ne sidi jari kar apane dushmano par waar kiya
 In Chhattisgarh, the alleged Dirty CD of the state PWD Minister Rajesh Munat has put the Raman Singh government on credit
 ye sidi us vakt ai jab gujarat or himachal pradesh main chunaav kii sargharmiyaan tej hai
 In both the states, the BJP is proving itself responsible to the public and is trying to brighten its face and character
 aise samay main bijepi shasit rajya chhattisgarh ke ek senior mantri kii kathith ashleel sidi ne party ko sakate main daal diya he
 The case was handed over to the CBI before the so-called SCD of this CD became a bad name for the government
 mukhyamantri raman singh ne kaha ki pradesh kii raajnneeti ke girte str ne unhen sochane par majaboor kar diya he
 This CD has created a panic in not only the BJP but the entire political corridor that not only the politicians but also the police and general public are restless to know where the CD was made, who made it and for what purpose
 charitra hatya kaa jariya ban gai he sidirajya ke mukhyamantri raman singh ke mutabiksidine raajnneeti ko ghinauna bana diya he
 He says that on the day of the market, sometimes a bureaucrat or a politician's CD is discussed
 lekin vaidhanik rup se isaki pushti kam hi ho paati he
 Recently, PWD Minister Rajesh Munat of the besieged state regarding Dirty CD says that CD has now become a source of character assassination
 rajnatik shadiyantra main yah ek aisa hathiyaar he jo kisi kii bhi chhavi ko mitti main mila saktaa he
 However, they are struggling with the reality of the CD, which has created a panic in the entire state
 sidi ne raajnneeti main blakemeling ko diya badhavaudhar congress pradesh adhyaksh bhupesh baghel kii daleel he ki kai maamalon main sidi ne sattadhari dal kii asaliyat kholi he
 According to him, BJP has been using political and administrative pressure since 2003
 iske kaaran uski asaliyat ujagar karne ke liye logon ko sidi kargar najar aati he
 They say that if any ruling party works according to law, then no one needs to make cds
 vahiin sibar krime or sidi kii parakh kar usase hone vaale aparaadhon par pakad rakhane vaale patrkaar gopal das kaa kahana he ki maujuuda daur kii raajnneeti main sab kuch jaij ho gaya he
 Ever since politics has been criminalized, there is a danger of central politics or regional everywhere that some intelligence is not recording your activities but your conversations with the camera
 unke mutabik sidi ne raajnneeti main blakemeling ko khub badhaava diya he
 There have been more than half a dozen major CD scandals in the state
 isamen centre sarkaar se lekar rajya sarkaar tak lapete main ai he
 1-the first CD scandal came to light when NCP leader Ramavatar Jaggi was shot dead by an unknown person in 2003 during the tenure of then Chief Minister Ajit Jogi
 is maamle main lagaataar teen sidi ain
 Through this CD the CBI reached the killers
 is maamle main ai kai sidion se tatkaaleen mukhyamantri ajit jogi ke bete amit jogi ko bhi jail kii hawa khaani padi
 However, he was later acquitted from the court
 lekin sidi ke jariye mili suraag se kul 31 aropiyon ko sajaa hui
 2-in the last month of the year 2003, a case of bribing Union Minister Dilip Singh Judeo, a member of the then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Bajpayee's board of ministers, came to light
 is sidi main dilip singh judev rishwat kii rakam sweekaarte hue kah rahe the ki 'paisa khuda to nahin par usase kam bhi nahin'
 In the assembly elections held in the state this year, BJP also released a CD
 us sidi main usne nirvatmaan mukhyamantri ajit jogi ke armaanon par pani pheraa or bijepi vidhayakon ko unke dwaara die ja rahe pralobhan or kharid farokht kaa khulaasa kiya
 During this period, the amount of 45 lakh given by the Congress to the BJP mlas was also exposed
 isaki audio or video donon sidi bani
 3-in 2005, bjp's Rajnadgaon MP Pradeep Gandhi became the victim of the sting operation Duryodhana till date
 vah sansad main sawaal poochne ke evaj main ghus lete hue camere main kaid hue the
 In this case, his membership of the Lok Sabha was abolished
 4-varsh 2016 main chhattisgarh ke antagarh upachunaav main congress pratyaashee manturam pavaar ne naamankan vaapasi ke aakhri din achaanak apana naam vaapis lekar apni hi congress party ko jhatka diya tha
 This did not challenge the BJP candidate and they won one sided
 chunaav sampann hone ke kuch dinon baad congress ne ek sidi jari kii
 Which showed how BJP leaders signed a withdrawal deal with Congress candidate Manturam
 congress pratyaashee kii kharid farokht kaa puraa hawala is sidi main darj tha
 5-in 2016, after Ajit Jogi left Congress, in his camp, he released a CD of the current state Congress President Bhupesh Baghel in which he was demanding a CD related to Ajit Jogi and his son Amit Jogi with a man
 wo is sidi ke evaj main us shaks ko congress cameti main padaadhikari banane kii peshkash bhi kar rahe the
 Overall, CD is seen to be very effective as a political weapon in Chhattisgarh
 chhattisgarh main sidiki raajnneeti ne rajanetaaon or aam logon ke sambandhon ko asahaj bana diya he
 Officers also shy away from their subordinate employees to talk to politicians and reconcile with their workers
 unhen is baat kaa dar laga rahaa tha he ki kahi khufia camaron ke jariye unki sidi to nahin ban rahi he
 Interestingly, the government directs a CBI inquiry to calm the ruckus created in the state
 masalaa chaahe darty pikchar kaa ho yaa phir rishwatakhori kaa
 CBI goes to the depth of the case
 baavjood abhi tak kisi bhi maamle main sidi main maujuud shaks kii adhikrut taur par pahchaan kar pai he
 The reason for this is that the original copy of the CD that went viral was never handed over to the investigating agencies
 natijatan forensik laboratory main sidi kii pramanikta siddh nahin ho paati or jaanch dhak ke teen paat sabit hoti he
 Politics has intensified following the alliance between Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party in Uttar Pradesh in the wake of Lok Sabha Election
 is gathbandhan ke saamne aane ke baad ab samaajawaaji party se alag hue varisht netaa shivpal yadav (shivpal Yadav) ne rajya main congress ke saath milakar ek nayaa gathbandhan banane kii ichha jataai he
 He has said that if the Congress wishes, he is ready to tie up with them
 unhone ravivaar ko kaha ki ham congress ko lekar puri tarah se taiyaar hai
 Please tell that Shivpal Yadav formed his own separate party from the Samajwadi Party last year

 kerala kii baadh ko sadi kii sabase bhayaavah baadh kaha ja rahaa he, lekin pichley saal jari kaig kii report main is tarah kii baadh kaa andeshaa jataayaa gaya tha
 If this report was taken seriously, the damage caused by the flood could have been reduced to a great extent
 paryaavaranvid vikrant tongad kaa kahana he ki desh main baadh prabandhan kaa bura haal he
 If the outbreak of flood is more, then the damage will be more, for example more compensation will be distributed for relief and rehabilitation
 vikrant kehete hai ki raahat evam punarvaas muaavje ko lekar adhikariyon kii dhaandhliyaan aapadaa sthitiyon ko jas kaa tas banaae rakhane kii ranneeti main juty rahati hai
 No single factor is responsible for the floods in Kerala

 Vikrant Tongad told IANS: "for almost a decade, we have been warned about the damage caused by climate change
 yakeenan, baadh ke vikaraal rup ke liye jalwaayu parivartan kaa bahut bada haath he lekin iske saath hi gharelu kaarak or sarkari nitiyaan bhi utani hi jimmedaar hai

 Our flood management and rehabilitation plan is not being fully implemented
 iske liye aavantit karodon rupee adhikariyon ke dauron or unki suvidhaon par kharch ho rahe hai
 There was a lot of furore over this report and it was said that if it goes on like this it will lead to a big tragedy
 "kerala main baadh kii is bhayavahata par vah kehete hai, "ham baadh rokane ke liye taiyaar nahin hai or kerala main to bilkul bhi taiyaari nahin thi
 The state's Disaster Management Authority's negligence and callous attitude have a big role in this, but yes the role of the Central Disaster Management Authority is still better than that of the state

 "vah kehete hai, "kaig kii report par gambhirtha se amal kiya jaataa to kerala kii baadh se hue nuksaan ko bahut had tak kam kiya ja saktaa tha

 Then how will the pockets be filled? "'muslims should give 10 per cent of Bakrid's expenses to the flood victims of Kerala'" he adds, "this is the situation of flood management in this country
 baadh kaa prakope zyada hoga to nuksaan zyada hoga, masalan raahat evam punarvaas ke liye zyada muaavja bantega
 The officers are happy in this
 " is bhrashtachar par vah kehete hai, "sirf vittiya bhrashtachar nahin he, vyaavhaarik bhrashtachar bhi he lekin yah bhi nahin he ki sirf in dhaandhliyon se hi baadh kaa khatra badha he
 Routine corruption in flood management is everywhere in the country

 yahi vajah he ki is imaarat ke paas bana ek doosraa restaraan durghatana ke vakt band padaa tha

 'achche din' kaa naaraa lekar narendra modi ne jab pehali baar loktantr ke mandir main kadam rakhaa to sansad kii choukhat ko jhukkar pranaam kiya tha
 Democracy means the people, for the people and by the people
 lekin dilachasp he ki daagiyon par chuppi se lekar porn bain tak modi sarkaar ab usee janata kii aawaaj ko dhata bataakar aage badhati najar aa rahi he
 The manner in which the Modi government has ordered the banning of 857 porn websites in the voice of the public from the voice of the public, unheard of, the question has started that whether the government will continue to issue such decrees in future also? The government argues that porn carries the wrong message in society
 agar vaaki aisa he to porn se pehle hamaare samaaj main mandir se lekar gufaaon or chowk-chauraahon tak kai aisi chije hai jinpar bain lagaae jane kii jarurat he
 a look at the 08 things that the government needs to ban # porn_ban: 1) If the temple of Khujraho is so bad, then what is the Prime Minister about the message going to the society from the pre-idol idols carved on stones in Khujraho ? Have opinions 2) vatsyayan kii kamasutraporn cites main stri-purush ke bich sambhog kriya ke chithran se yadi bhartiya samaaj ko vaaki darane kii jarurat he, to sadiyon pehle rachi gai mahaan rachana kamasutra par sarkaar kya raay rakhti he
 If the picture was possible then the artist's brush had spread magic on them as well
 3) deshbhar main bikate lugdi sahityadeshbhar main har gali ke chowk-chauraahey par lugdi sahitya bikate hai
 Somewhere openly and in secret
 mastaram se lekar aise tamaam sahityakar yun hi charchaa kaa vishay nahin he
 In such a situation, if you get wrong thoughts in your mind by watching porn, then there will be no chanting after reading these literature
 4) tamaam angreji antertenment or movies channelsarkaar jis tarah bhartiya sabhyataa kii pairvi kar rahi he or ise har aire gaire chizon se khatra bataa rahi he, is lihaaj se desh main un tamaam angreji antertenment or tivi channelon ko bhibain karne kii jarurathai
 Because during 24 hours they are shown many such scenes, which are a threat to 'indian culture'

 Senior Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge on Friday wrote to the Modi government for the seventh time and turned down the offer to join the Lokpal's selection committee as a 'special invitee member'

 Now the deadline has also passed
 mana ja rahaa he ki salection cameti kii aaj lokapal ke chayan ke liye baithak hogi
 Mallikarjun Kharge has said in a letter to PM Narendra Modi that there is no right to participate in the selection of Lokpal as a special invited member
 isliye ham yah ofer nahin sweekaar kar sakate, jisamen itane gambhir maamle main vipaksh ko 'khamosh' rahanaa pade
 Not getting a place in the panel appointed as Lokpal as Leader of Opposition or Leader of Opposition's largest party has been a matter of controversy

 Congress did not even officially get the post of Leader of Opposition in the House, winning just 44 seats in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 kyonki kul 543 main se das pratishat siten laana iske liye jaruri hota he
 This led to a technical problem in the formation of those important panels, through which appointments are made to posts like Lokpal and CBI Director

 Ayodhya case hearing in Supreme Court, Zafaryab Jilani on behalf of Muslim side, plea of dalirajiv Dhawan ended on Tuesday, 30th day in the case of Dilemmaram janmabhoomi-babri Masjid
 is dauraan supreme court main muslim paksh kii ore se daleel di gai
 When Zafaryab Jilani was appearing in the court, the Supreme Court asked him for proof of offering Namaz at the disputed site
 jisapar jilani kii ore se kaha gaya ki unke paas koi likhit saboot nahin he
 In fact, on the Muslim side, on Tuesday, Rajiv Dhawan completed his plea in the Supreme Court
 jiske baad jafarayab jilani kii ore se bahes ko aage badhaayaa gaya
 At the same time, Zafaryab Jilani said that there is a belief in the birthplace of Ayodhya on the birth of Ram, but there is no evidence from the Hindu side
 jilani ne kaha ki abhi tak kii daleelon main ramcharita maanas, valmiki ramayana kaa zikr kiya gaya he
 But the petitioners will have to prove in which texts the talk of Ram Janmasthan has been done
 kyonki ramcharita maanas, valmiki ramayana main janmasthan kaa koi zikr nahin he
 He said that before 1949, there is no existence or proof of Ramjanma, worship under the middle dome
 ayodhya cese: SC ne poocha- ramchabutare ko janmasthan maanate ho? jilani bole- ji haanisi par justise bobade ne jafarayab jilani se poocha ki kya aap ye saboot denge ki 1949 se pehle vahaan niyamit namaaz hoti thi?isapar jafarayab jilani ne jawaab diya ki hamaare paas jo saboot hai, wo jubaani hai lekin likhit main nahin he
 On this, Justice Ashok Bhushan said that even in the argument of the Hindu side, Ramayana, Ramcharit Manas mention the birth of Rama in Dasharatha palace in Ayodhya, although there is no mention of the place
 ek gavaah ne bhi bataaya ki kavitawali or anya granthon main bhi ramajanm ayodhya yaa avadhpuri yaa saket kaa zikr he par vishisht janmasthan kaa nahin
 The witnesses also could not tell the distance and direction of the disputed site from Vashisht Kund, Lomash Kund, Vidhaneshwar Ganesh and Pindarak
 valmiki ramayana main bhi koi vishisht sthaan nahin bataaya gaya
 Jilani said that the Ramcharit Manas was composed almost 70 years after the mosque was built, but there is no mention that the Ram Janmasthan is where the mosque is
 yani janmasthan ko lekar hinduon kii aasthaa bhi baad main badal gai
 On this, Justice Bobde said that Babur broke the temple and built a mosque, or had there ever been a temple, built a mosque at that place or a mosque bansi at an empty place? On this question, Jilani said that Babur had built a mosque on an empty plot
 agar pehle mandir rahaa hoga to babar ko isaki jaankaree naa ho
 Jilani said that before 1855 there was no dispute here
 jab shoot daakhil kiya gaya tabase yahaan kaa mahatv bad gaya
 On this, Justice Bobde said that how many mosques were built by Mir Baqi? In response, Jilani said that according to Ain Akbari, the areas were divided into subbs and mosques were constructed by the subedars
 jilani ne kaha ki aaine akabari main puure samrajya ko sthapit karne kaa byora he
 This is one such book, in which every detail is mentioned during the Mughal rule
 justise bobade ne kaha ki agar aaine akabari main sabhi kaa byora he to masjid kaa zikr kyon nahin he
 In response, Jilani said that it was not the emperor but the commander
 us jagah par mandir nahin tha jise daawa kiya ja rahaa he ki todaa gaya
 When there is mention of breaking the temple at Kashi in Ain Akbari, there would also be mention of Ayodhya's temple breaking
 jilani ine e akabari main bhi ramajnmabhumi kaa nahin, lekin pavitra shahar avadh kaa zikr he jahaan hindu ram kii puja karte hai
 Justice Bhushan interrupted Geelani that Skandpuran has also cited your witness in which he has spoken about Ram's birthplace

 aaj antarrashtriya majdoor diwas he
 In almost 80 countries, this day is celebrated on May 1, whoever is working in any form in this world is a laborer
 kisi ne kya khub likhaa he:-'saalon tak dil par rakhe pathar kaa boj wo dhota he
 Whoever the profession is, a laborer who earns away from home is a laborer
 
 
 aaj jo desh chal rahaa he, usamen unheen tamaam mazdooron kaa yogadan he, jo ji-tod mehnat kar din-raat kaam karte hai
 We salute the workers who have made significant contribution in building and running this world
 
 Know when the day of laborers started is an important job, equally important is rest
 pehle mazdooron ke kaam karne kaa samay tay nahin tha
 It is said that the celebrations of International Labor Day began on May 1, 1886, when the workers' union of America went on strike to keep the work hours no longer than 8 hours
 
 
 
 Vinod Khanna, all the laborers, took to the streets of America when careers became 'sexy monks'
 unka kahana tha ki kaam kaa samay adhik he jiskaa asar unki sehat par padataa he
 At that time, the strike of the workers did not make much difference to America, but after some time the time was fixed for 8 hours to work in America
 aaj bharat samet kai deshon main 8 ghante kaam karne kaa kanoon he
 In 1886, Labor Day came into force as soon as Labor Day was announced in India
 lekin bharat main isaki shuruuaat 1 may 1923 main chennai main hui jahaan pehali baar ise manaaya gaya
 Earlier in Chennai, this day was celebrated as Madras Day, but it was agreed before the High Court of Madras that this day should be celebrated as Workers' Day in India and a holiday should be declared on this day
 aaj bharat samet lagbhag 80 desho main yah diwas 1 may ko manaaya jaataa he
 No matter how successful a person becomes in voice of the workers, but behind him is the worker who does your small work
 guru nanak sahab ne mazdooron ke haq main us vakt aawaaj uthaai jab us samay ke ahamkaari or lutere haakim oont paalak bhaagon kii roti na kha kar us kaa ahankaar todaa
 Guru Nanak Dev Ji gave the message of working, chanting names
 ye kehete the baapumazdooron ko lekar baapu kaa kahana tha ki kisi bhi desh kii tarakkee us desh ke kamgaaron or kisaanon par nirbhar karti he
 Without them, development of their country is not possible
 baba sahab ambedkar ne dilaayaa mazdooron ko haqbaaba sahab ambedkar ne kaha kiinsaanon ko gulam banaakar aaj hajaaron badshaah bane hai
 But even today, all those laborers are not thought about the difficulties they are going through
 vah ambedkar hi he jinhone mazdooron ke haq main adhinium lagu kiya jisamen karmchaaree rajya beemaa (iesai), shramikon ko chikitsa dekhbhaal, medical live ( biimaar ho jane par milane vaali chuttee ),kaam ke dauraan shaareerik rup se aksham ho jane par vibhinn suvidhaayen pradaan karne ke liye kshatipurti beemaa pradaan karavaaya
 India became the first country to implement the 'insurance Act' for laborers in Asian countries, thanks to Dr
 Babasaheb Ambedkar
 aisa kalakaar jisane neude tasviir banaakar bhi banaai har ghar main jagah8 ghante kaam karwaane vaali ye thi pehali companijahan aaj bhi kai badi companiyon main 10 ghante se zyada karmchaariyon se kaam karavaaya jaataa he, vahiin desh kii pehlicanord Motor companyesi vaahan nirmaataa company bani, jisane sabase pehle 8 ghante kaam karne kaa niyam lagu kiya tha
 Labor Day will not be celebrated in Haryana this year
 Haryana Government has decided not to celebrate Labor Day this year
 pradesh ke shram rajya mantri naayab singh saini ne kaha ki 1 may ko majdoor diwas nahin manaayenge
 Mazdoor Day will be celebrated on Vishwakarma Day, which happens on the next day of Deepawali
 haalanki majdoor sanghathanon ne iskaa virodh kiya he
 The trade union union leader Samuel Gompers has said that 'labor is the basis of every society
 manavata kii rachi koi bhi cheez dikhaa dijie
 In which the laborers do not work hard and i will show you the thing without which this society can run smoothly
 aapako bataaden bharat main kul 16, 154 trade union hai jinaki sanyukt sadsyta kareeb 91
 8 lakhs
 (2012 ke aankadon ke hisaab se) 
 There is no break in costume design, the first OSCAR in the country connects one country to another 'worker' Karl Marx said 'WORKERS UNITE THE WORLD' which means that all the workers of the world work from one country to another
 Which keeps the countries united
 'antarrashtriya majdoor diwas' lakhon mazdooron ke parishram, drudh nishchay or nishtha kaa diwas he
 Today, the workers who are sitting and working comfortably, there is a link between those workers who work day and night
 chaahe aap or ham kitna bhi bada mukaam hasil kar len lekin ye kahana galat nahin hoga ki hamaari safalataa ke peeche ek majdoor kaa haath bhi he jo hamaare liye kaam karata he
 Our salute to every laborer on International Labor Day

 In fact, the petition was made by keeping the tweet made by Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on August 23
 jisamen dashami ke din 6 baje tak hi visarjan kii ijaajat di gai thi, kyonki agle din muharram he
 Therefore, the immersion was banned and orders were made for the immersion date
 isko lekar youth baar association of india ne yachika daayar kii thi
 Which said that the Chief Minister's Twitter account has lakhs of followers and it is not being corrected with the religious rituals of the larger community to appease the particular community

 There is also a violation of Sections 14, 25 and 26 of the Constitution

 The court rebuked the state government, saying that it was a policy of appeasement and not to associate politics with religion
 court ne pichhali saal ye bhi kaha tha ki 1982 or 1983 main dashami or muharram isi tarah ek din aage peeche padaa tha tab to koi pabandi nahin lagaai gai thi

 PM shud call a spl session of Parliament to discuss Rafael
 - Arvind Kejriwal (@arvindkejriwal) September 22, 2018 PM Modi gives the answer, the leader of the Aam Aadmi Party, Gopal Raine said that the then President of France is lying, it is not only a question of the identity of the Prime Minister but of the entire country

 Why is the Prime Minister silent on the Rafale deal issue? Did you really scam Rafael Deal? 2

 How Rafale aircraft worth 526 crores is 1670 crores, that is, how the price of a ship has increased by 300 times? The Aam Aadmi Party alleges that the first agreement between the two countries on the purchase of Rafale was changed by the BJP government in the secret clause
 Added a new clause to the name so that any information on the issue cannot be excluded and the theft which is being done under the cover of Rafael Deal can be hidden
