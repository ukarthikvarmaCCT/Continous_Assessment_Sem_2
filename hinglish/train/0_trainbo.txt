 Donald Trump will be the new president of America
 raashtrapati chunaav main hillari clinton ko maat dene vaale trump kii kamyaabi se duniya hairaan he
 a person who has no experience in politics, he steps into the world of politics before the US presidential election and every heart gets murdered on seeing this
 haalanki, trump is dauraan apni harkaton or ateet ko lekar vivaadon main bhi rahe
 But facing all the challenges, Trump has set an example for the world
 trump kii kamyaabi se dhai saal pehle bharat main hue aam chunaav kii yaad aa gai, jababijepi kii prachand jeetka sehara narendra modi ke sir par sajaa tha
 Trump is a fan of Modi
 unhen pataa he ki narendra modi bhartiya apravasiyon ke bich behad lokapriy hai
 Trump has also praised PM Modi and India on several occasions
 vaise dekha jaae to trump or modi ke bich kuch baton ko lekar samanta bhi he
 1
 modi kii tarah trump kaa vyaktitv bhi behad mukhar he
 He holds any issue, Parbebak, and it is his specialty to stand firm in front of the enemy
 ye donon hi 'great shoman' hai
 Are good speakers and know how to please the crowd
 apane-apane chunaav prachaar ke dauraan modi or trump- donon ne hi apane virodhiyon par tikhe hamale kiye
 2
 modi or trump- donon hi 'narseicist' hai
 People who love themselves very much
 inhen lagata he ki ye behad pratibhashali hai or janata kii dikkatein dur karne ke liye upar vaale ne inhen dharti par bheja he
 Trump had also once mentioned how women critics would never attack him for his 'good look'
 duusari ore, modi ke narseicist hone par bhi log baaten karte hai
 During a meeting with US President Barack Obama, Modi wore a suit with stripes bearing his name written on it
 iske alaava modi kaa selfi ko lekar pyaar bhi jagajaahir he
 3
 trump ne bhartiya mul ke votaron kaa dil jeetne ke liye narendra modi ke mashhoor naare 'abaki baar, modi sarkaar' kii nakal kar apana naaraa banaaya, 'abaki baar, trump sarkaar
 Modi had shown the public the dream of 'achhe Din' in the general election
 trump ne isi tarj par america ko phir se mahaan banane kii apil janata se kii
 4
 trump or modi- donon par hi alpsankhyakon ke prati doharaa ravaiya apnaane kaa aarope lagata rahaa he
 During one of his speeches in Kolkata, Modi threatened to ban Bangladeshi immigrants
 haalanki unhone ek baar yah bhi kaha tha ki bangladeshi hindu pravaasiyon kaa bharat main swaagat he
 On the other hand at the heart of Trump is hatred towards Muslims and migrants from Mexico
 chunaav prachaar ke dauraan trump ne iesas ke aatankwaadiyon par bam barasaane, musalamaanon ko america main ghusane se rokane or mexico ke pravaasiyon ko america main ghusane se rokane ke liye badi diwaar banaae jane kii baat kar chuke hai
 In this way, 'radical nationalism' dominates both
 5
 The specialty of both Trump and Modi is that they did not inherit power
 inhone apane boote ise hasil kii
 Modi, an RSS pracharak, won the pm's candidature bypassing BJP veteran LK Advani
 isi tarah republican party main 'bahari' samajhe ja rahe trump ne party ke diggajon ke saamne apni ummidavaari ko sahi sabit kiya

 Congress's UP president Raj Babbar has called the Yogi government a dictatorial government
 mujhe pataa he ki aaj bhi netaaon ne bade-bade bayaan die hai
 Hot issues of debate are given
 lekin main aaj aapako sumit ke bare main bataanaa chahta hum
 Therefore, i am telling you so that you understand why it is important to place this issue in the first list of the country's priority list
 sumit us bharat ke naujavaanon kaa pratinidhitiv karata he jisaki sankhya karodon main he
 Whom politics and the system only makes fools
 jinke liye politics main aae din bhavuk muddon ko gadha jaataa he, taaki aise naujavaanon ko bahakaaya ja sake
 Because everyone knows that the day the youth like Sumit understood the game of these emotional issues, the day the game of political leaders will come to an end
 magar chintaa mat kiijie
 Political leaders will always win in this battle
 unhen aap badal sakate hai, haraa nahin sakate hai
 Therefore, youth like Sumit have to lose
 sumit kii is tasviir main zindagi ke sapanom ke liye kitni jagah he
 Let the whole world be held in his arms
 35-40 lakh parikshaarthiyon ke bich jo chotii ke 500 main aate hai unka hi chayan inakam tex inspector ke liye hota he
 Sumit was one of them
 giridih ke saraswati vidya mandir se padhaa yah chaatr 2014 main dilli aayaa tha
 Was selected for coaching and income tax inspector
 inakam tex inspector ke liye chunaa bhi gaya magar jwining nahin hui
 When a year and a half passed while waiting for joining, Sumit started suffering from depression and finally hanged in his own room on 19 September
 mar gaya
 Amarnath Sinha from Giridih has sent this report
 mujhe bahut se naujavaanon ke har din massej aate hai
 From different states
 alag alag parikshaon ke
 There are so many messages that i had to write more posts on the channel that i do not have a secretariat
 na hi itane reporter
 i can not lekin us naa ke baad bhi noujvaan nahin rukte hai, kyonki unki sunne vaala koi nahin he
 No government examination is completed in less than two years
 ho jaati he to jwining hone main saal lag jate hai
 You must have noticed that since September last year, we are constantly showing how our system is cheating our youth under the university series and job series in prime time
 ek ke baad tees se zyada series karne ke baad hamane naukari series kii ginati chhod di
 But during this series, one thing was understood that in many states of the country, there is a factory for fooling youth in the name of government jobs, namely the State Public Service Selection Commission and Public Service Staff Selection Commission
 in aayogon ke zarie jis tarah se yuvaaon ko naukariyon ke form nikaal kar thaga jaataa he, wo bhayaavah he
 a lot of money is also taken from the form
 bina nakal ke shaayad hi koi pariksha hoti he
 There is a case in the court about many examinations, where the hearing goes on for months and the youth are wasting in the hope of job
 ghotalebaz or bhrasht netaaon ke liye alag court banane kii baat ho jaati he magar in parikshaon main fanse lakhon naujavaanon ko mukti dene ke liye alag se kahin court nahin he
 Lawsuits go on year after year
 naukari series ke dauraan ham kuch hi rajyon kii kuch parikshaon kaa dikhaa sake, lekin naujavaanon ke saath thagi or dhokhadhadi kaa yah project is level par chal rahaa he ki ham sabakaa dikhaa hi nahin sakate hai
 The leaders should thank the hindu-muslim topic that our youth got swayed
 varna jis din wo yah khel samaj jayega netaaon ko jawaab dena mushkil ho jaae
 There is no improvement in the functioning of these selection commissions even after months of showing series
 kai jagahon par series ke dabaav main naukariyaan deni padi hai or noujvaan jaanata he ki agar prime time main maheenon kawarej nahin hota to kisi kii jwining nahin hoti
 The Staff Selection Commission is under the Central Government
 kam se kam is ayog ko to upiessi kii tarah kaam karnaa chahie tha jisaki vishwasaneeyata hoti
 From date to result and joining after the result

 Spent over two years in it
 aap kalpana nahin kar sakate hai ki in naujavaanon ko kitni hataasha niraashaa hoti he
 Meaning there is also a limit to not doing the work of these commissions
 in aayogon main bhi kaam karne ke liye paryaapt karmchaaree nahin hai
 That is a different problem
 giridih kaa sumit akelaa nahin he
 Many of his companions are still waiting for joining
 2016 kii staff salection pariksha main paas hue excise inspector jwining kaa intazaar kar rahe hai

 Some is done, some is left
 hota yah he ki ek hi pariksha paas karne ke baad kuch log kai maheenon se selary le rahe hai, kuch log pariksha paas kar bina selary ke berojgaar baithe hai
 As a rule, the government should pay the salary from the day of the result
 SSC CHSL 2016 main postal vibhaag main 6500 pad the
 Not all positions have been joined in Maharashtra Circle
 5 sitambar ko cirkil kaa aavanton ho gaya tha, magar abhi tak jwining hui thi

 24 saal kii umr main jisane yah pariksha di thi wo ab 28-29 saal kaa hone ja rahaa he, jabaki yah pariksha 25 saal kii umr main paas kar jwining kar saktaa tha
 Now we explain to you through a chart how these Government Selection Boards are cheating the youth
 dilli adhinsth seva board ne 803 padon kii vekainsee nikaali thi, jise badhaakar 841 kar diya magar riselt niklaa to sirf 554 kaa hi niklaa
 Nearly 300 posts disappeared
 janvari 2014 main fire operator ke liye form niklaa
 The examination took place on 31 August 2014
 agast 2014 se june 2016 you hin biit gaya
 nothing happen
 uske baad 17 june se 29 june ke bich chhatrasaal stadium main physical test hua
 There was a driving test from 1 September 2017 to 22 September 2017
 16 november 2017 ko riselt aayaa
 There is also a matter of going to court
 koi court chalaa gaya or riselt ke baad kii gatividhi ruuk gai
 The order has come in this September that the result which has come out is correct
 ab jaakar dilli adhinsth seva chayan board ne 350 naujavaanon ke dogier dilli fire sarvice ko bheje hai
 The remaining 197 students have not yet been sent, who recently staged a sit-in
 2014 se 2018 aa gaya
 From taking the exam to the result
 jwining nahin hui
 So you may think that this story is boring but look into their life and see how they are suffocating
 14 sitambar ke prime time main hamane isi staff salection kamishan kii ek pariksha main paas hue naujavaanon kii vyathaa dikhaai thi
 The result has come in February 2018 but it has not been joined for seven months
 500 se adhik noujvaan military ejineering services main jwining kaa intazaar kar rahe hai
 By the way, in many press conferences, the minister is heard saying that there can be no compromise with the security of the country
 unhen dhyaan rakhana chahie ki ye khaali pad bhi desh kii suraksha se samjhauta hi hai
 The comments 14 sitambar ke prime time main chalane ke baad bhi 20 sitambar tak inke maamle main kuch nahin hua he
 Similarly, youth are being tortured and made to wait
 desh kii raksha mantri nirmala sitaraman ne twit bhi kiya tha ki is maamle ko dekhenge
 6 days have passed
 is maamle main abhi tak kuch nahin hua he
 When will they join? rajyon ke bhartee aayogon main ek se ek ghotaale hote rahete hai
 But the Vyapam scam of Madhya Pradesh was the most brutal
 2013 main yah maamla saamne aayaa or usee saal pehali giraftaar hui thi
 Two years later, the order of the Supreme Court reached the CBI
 lekin 5 saal biit jane ke baad bhi yah mukadmaa anjaam par nahin pahunchaa he
 The Vyapam scam was to pass money to students by taking medical examination
 chargeshit main kai adhikariyon ke naam hai
 The chief minister also has names
 purv mukhyamantri digvijay singh ne 27 hazaar pannon kaa ricard pesh kiya he
 On September 22, Abhishek Manu Singhvi, p Chidambaram and Kapil Sibal are going to Bhopal for lobbying in this case
 digvijay singh, prashanth pandey kii yachika ek baar supreme court se nirast ho chuki he
 Vyapam's condition is similar to that of many examinations and commissions
 cese hi chalata rah jaataa he
 Today's episode is dedicated to Sumit of Giridih
 kaash wo thodaa or intazaar kar letaa
 Millions of youth like Sumit are saddened by this news
 wo twitor par pradhanmantri se lekar bhaanti-bhaanti ke mantri tak ko twit kar rahe hai
 To be is nothing
 ek pariksha main kuch ho jaataa he, 10 parikshaayen atak jaati hai
 The Labor Minister of every government should submit a report every month
 kitni vekainsee nikali, kitni pariksha kaa riselt nikalne vaala he
 When will you join? iskaa states report har maheene aana chahie taaki naujavaanon ke saath dhokhadhadi band ho
 So that no Sumit had to commit suicide again
 upi ke shikshamitron par prime time kiya tha
 Education friends had told that several hundred died of suicide, stress, depression and heart attacks but nothing happened
 sumit kii is tasviir main zindagi ke sapanom ke liye kitni jagah he
 Let the whole world be held in his arms
 35-40 lakh parikshaarthiyon ke bich jo chotii ke 500 main aate hai unka hi chayan inakam tex inspector ke liye hota he
 Sumit was one of them
 giridih ke saraswati vidya mandir se padhaa yah chaatr 2014 main dilli aayaa tha
 Was selected for coaching and income tax inspector
 inakam tex inspector ke liye chunaa bhi gaya magar jwining nahin hui
 When a year and a half passed while waiting for joining, Sumit started suffering from depression and finally hanged in his own room on 19 September
 mar gaya
 Amarnath Sinha from Giridih has sent this report
 mujhe bahut se naujavaanon ke har din massej aate hai
 From different states
 alag alag parikshaon ke
 There are so many messages that i had to write more posts on the channel that i do not have a secretariat
 na hi itane reporter
 i can not lekin us naa ke baad bhi noujvaan nahin rukte hai, kyonki unki sunne vaala koi nahin he
 No government examination is completed in less than two years
 ho jaati he to jwining hone main saal lag jate hai
 You must have noticed that since September last year, we are constantly showing how our system is cheating our youth under the university series and job series in prime time
 ek ke baad tees se zyada series karne ke baad hamane naukari series kii ginati chhod di
 But during this series, one thing was understood that in many states of the country, there is a factory for fooling youth in the name of government jobs, namely the State Public Service Selection Commission and Public Service Staff Selection Commission
 in aayogon ke zarie jis tarah se yuvaaon ko naukariyon ke form nikaal kar thaga jaataa he, wo bhayaavah he
 a lot of money is also taken from the form
 bina nakal ke shaayad hi koi pariksha hoti he
 There is a case in the court about many examinations, where the hearing goes on for months and the youth are wasting in the hope of job
 ghotalebaz or bhrasht netaaon ke liye alag court banane kii baat ho jaati he magar in parikshaon main fanse lakhon naujavaanon ko mukti dene ke liye alag se kahin court nahin he
 Lawsuits go on year after year
 naukari series ke dauraan ham kuch hi rajyon kii kuch parikshaon kaa dikhaa sake, lekin naujavaanon ke saath thagi or dhokhadhadi kaa yah project is level par chal rahaa he ki ham sabakaa dikhaa hi nahin sakate hai
 The leaders should thank the hindu-muslim topic that our youth got swayed
 varna jis din wo yah khel samaj jayega netaaon ko jawaab dena mushkil ho jaae
 There is no improvement in the functioning of these selection commissions even after months of showing series
 kai jagahon par series ke dabaav main naukariyaan deni padi hai or noujvaan jaanata he ki agar prime time main maheenon kawarej nahin hota to kisi kii jwining nahin hoti
 The Staff Selection Commission is under the Central Government
 kam se kam is ayog ko to upiessi kii tarah kaam karnaa chahie tha jisaki vishwasaneeyata hoti
 From date to result and joining after the result
 sumit ne 2016 kii esayssi kambind graduate level kii pariksha di thi
 Look at the calendar of this exam
 march 2016 main esayssi sijiel kaa form niklaa tha
 The first examination took place in August 2016
 mens kii pariksha hui 30 november / 1 disambar 2016 ko
 Tier-3 examination was held on 19 March 2017
 tair-4 kii pariksha hui april-may 2017 main
 The final result came out on 5 August 2017
 march 2016 se agast 2017 aa gaya
 a year and a half passed
 riselt nikle ke baad jwining hone ke liye abhi bhi bahut se noujvaan intazaar kar rahe hai
 August 2017 to 20 September 2018 arrived
 13 maheene isamen biit gaye
 Spent over two years in it
 aap kalpana nahin kar sakate hai ki in naujavaanon ko kitni hataasha niraashaa hoti he
 Meaning there is also a limit to not doing the work of these commissions
 in aayogon main bhi kaam karne ke liye paryaapt karmchaaree nahin hai
 That is a different problem
 giridih kaa sumit akelaa nahin he
 Many of his companions are still waiting for joining
 2016 kii staff salection pariksha main paas hue excise inspector jwining kaa intazaar kar rahe hai
 Since 13 months
 duniya kaa ek desh bataa dijie jahaan naukari main chune jane ke baad jwining ke liye 13 maheene intazaar karne padate hai
 850 young men were elected to the Excise Inspector
 kuch zone main jwining ho gai he magar abhi kolkata, mumbai, dilli, goa or bhopal zone main abhi tak jwining nahin hui he
 The process is in progress
 mumbai zone main to teen-teen vibhaagon kii jwining nahin hui he
 Looking forward to joining physical and medical examinations in the month of August
 23 saal kii umr me form bharaa tha
 i am 26 now
 ek noujvaan ne kaha
 This is the condition of government examinations in India
 inakam tex sahaayak ke liye paas karne vaale naujavaanon kii bhi jwining nahin hui he
 Some is done, some is left
 hota yah he ki ek hi pariksha paas karne ke baad kuch log kai maheenon se selary le rahe hai, kuch log pariksha paas kar bina selary ke berojgaar baithe hai
 As a rule, the government should pay the salary from the day of the result
 SSC CHSL 2016 main postal vibhaag main 6500 pad the
 Not all positions have been joined in Maharashtra Circle
 5 sitambar ko cirkil kaa aavanton ho gaya tha, magar abhi tak jwining hui thi
 Through SSC multi-tasking Staff 2016, 941 candidates were selected for the income tax department
 28 april 2018 ko riselt aayaa

 So far, they have given 7 to 8 pickets in connection with this exam

 This story is heart wrenching

 Different examinations
 itane massej aate hai ki mujhe channel par or baqayda post likhnaa padaa ki mere paas koi sachivalay nahin he
 Nor so many reporters
 main nahin kar saktaa hum
 But even after that, young people do not stop, because there is no one to listen to them
 koi bhi sarkari pariksha do saal se kam main puri nahin hoti he
 If it does, then it takes years to join
 aapane dekha hoga ki pichley saal sitambar se ham prime time main uniwarsity series or naukari series ke tahat lagaataar dikhaate ja rahe hai ki hamaara system kaise hamaare naujavaanon ko dhokhaa de rahaa he
 We dropped the job series count after doing more than thirty series in a row
 magar is series ke dauraan ek baat samaj aa gai ki desh ke kai rajyon main sarkari naukari ke naam par yuvaaon ko ullu banane kii ek factory he jiskaa naam he rajya lok seva chayan ayog or lok seva karmchaaree chayan ayog
 The way youths are duped out of jobs through these commissions is frightening
 form ke bhi kaaphi paise liye jate hai
 There is hardly any examination without copying
 kai parikshaon ko lekar court main cese ho jaataa he jahaan dhimi gati se maheenon sunwaayee chalati rahati he or noujvaan naukari kii aas main barbaad hote rahete hai
 There is talk of creating separate courts for the scamsters and corrupt leaders, but there is no separate court for the liberation of millions of youth trapped in these examinations
 saal saal mukademe chalate hai
 During the job series, we were able to show some examinations in a few states, but this project of cheating and cheating with the youth is going on at a level that we cannot show everyone
 netaaon ko hindu-muslim topic kaa shukriya adaa karnaa chahie ki jisamen hamaara noujvaan bahak gaya
 Otherwise, the day he will understand this game, it becomes difficult for the leaders to answer
 maheenon series dikhaane ke baad bhi in chayan aayogon kii karypranali main koi sudhaar nahin he
 Many places have had to give jobs under the pressure of the series and the youngster knows that if there was no months coverage in prime time, no one would join
 staff sellection kamishan to kend sarkaar ke tahat he
 At least this commission should have acted like UPSC which would have credibility

 These students say that neither further examination was conducted without result, nor result was out

 yah kahani dil dahala dene vaali he
 The person who gave this exam at the age of 24 is now going to be 28-29 years old, while he could have joined by passing this exam at the age of 25 years
 ab ham aapako ek chart ke jariye samajhaate hai ki kaise ye sarkari chayan board naujavaanon ke saath dhokhaa kar rahe hai
 Delhi Subordinate Services Board had removed the vacancy for 803 posts, which was increased to 841 but only 554 were released
 kareeb 300 pad gaayab ho gaye
 In January 2014, the form for the fire operator came out
 31 agast 2014 ko pariksha hui
 From August 2014 to June 2016 Yu passed away
 kuch nahin hua
 It was followed by a physical test at the Chhatrasal Stadium between 17 June and 29 June
 1 sitambar 2017 se 22 sitambar 2017 tak driving kii pariksha hui
 Result came on 16 November 2017
 ek maamla court main jane kaa bhi he
 Some went to court and the post-results activity stopped
 isi sitambar main aadesh aayaa he ki jo rigelt niklaa he sahi he
 Now, the Delhi Subordinate Services Selection Board has sent dossiers of 350 youths to Delhi Fire Service
 baaki 197 chaatro ke abhi tak nahin bheje hai, jinhone haal hi main dharna diya tha
 2014 to 2018 arrived
 pariksha dene se lekar riselt nikalne tak
 Did not join isliye aapako lag saktaa he ki yah story boring he magar inaki zindagi main jhaank kar dekhie inkaa dam kaise ghut rahaa he
 In the prime time of September 14, we showed the agony of the youth who passed the examination of this Staff Selection Commission
 farvari 2018 main riselt aa gaya he magar saat maheene ho gaye jwining nahin hui
 More than 500 youth are waiting to join Military Engineering Services
 vaise kai press conference main mantri kehete sunai dete hai ki desh kii suraksha se koi samjhauta nahin ho saktaa he
 They should keep in mind that even these vacant posts are compromised with the security of the country
 tippaniyan Even after running in the prime time of 14 September, nothing has happened in their case till 20 September
 isi tarah tadapaa-tadapaa kar naujavaanon ko intazaar karaayaa ja rahaa he
 The country's Defense Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had also tweeted that it will look into the matter
 6 din guzar gaye
 Nothing has happened in this case yet
 inaki jwining kab hogi
 There are one to one scams in the recruitment commissions of the states
 magar madhya pradesh kaa vyapam ghotaalaa sabase krur tha
 The case came to light in 2013 and the first arrest was made in the same year
 do saal baad supreme court ke aadesh se sibiai ke paas pahunchaa
 But even after 5 years, this case has not reached its conclusion
 vyapam ghotaalaa medical pariksha main paise lekar chaatro ko paas karaane kaa tha
 The chargesheet has names of several officers
 mukhyamantri ke bhi naam hai
 Former Chief Minister Digvijay Singh has presented a record of 27 thousand pages
 22 sitambar ko abhishek manu singhvi, pi chidambaram or kapil sibbal is maamle main pairvi ke liye bhopal jane vaale hai
 The petition of Digvijay Singh, Prashant Pandey has once been dismissed from the Supreme Court
 vyapam kaa jo haal he vahi kai parikshaon or aayogon kaa he
 The case continues
 aaj kaa episod giridih ke sumit ko samarpit he
 i wish he could have waited a little longer
 sumit jaise lakhon noujvaan is khabar se dukhi hai
 He is tweeting from Prime Minister to Minister of various types on Twitter
 hona janaa kuch nahin he
 Something happens in one exam, 10 exams are stuck
 har sarkaar ke shram mantri ko har maheene ek report deni chahie
 How much vacancy came out, how many exam results are going to come out
 jwining kab hogi
 Its status report should come every month so that the fraud with the youth is stopped
 taaki phir kisi sumit ko khudakushi na kerani padi
 Did prime time on up's Shiksha Mitras
 shiksha mitron ne bataaya tha ki kai sau khudakushi, tanaav, avsaad or hrydayaghat se mar gaye magar kuch nahin hua

 This is the condition of government examinations in India
 inakam tex sahaayak ke liye paas karne vaale naujavaanon kii bhi jwining nahin hui he
 Some is done, some is left
 hota yah he ki ek hi pariksha paas karne ke baad kuch log kai maheenon se selary le rahe hai, kuch log pariksha paas kar bina selary ke berojgaar baithe hai
 As a rule, the government should pay the salary from the day of the result
 SSC CHSL 2016 main postal vibhaag main 6500 pad the
 Not all positions have been joined in Maharashtra Circle
 5 sitambar ko cirkil kaa aavanton ho gaya tha, magar abhi tak jwining hui thi

 This story is heart wrenching
 24 saal kii umr main jisane yah pariksha di thi wo ab 28-29 saal kaa hone ja rahaa he, jabaki yah pariksha 25 saal kii umr main paas kar jwining kar saktaa tha

 The remaining 197 students have not yet been sent, who recently staged a sit-in
 2014 se 2018 aa gaya

 So you may think that this story is boring but look into their life and see how they are suffocating
 14 sitambar ke prime time main hamane isi staff salection kamishan kii ek pariksha main paas hue naujavaanon kii vyathaa dikhaai thi
 The result has come in February 2018 but it has not been joined for seven months
 500 se adhik noujvaan military ejineering services main jwining kaa intazaar kar rahe hai
 By the way, in many press conferences, the minister is heard saying that there can be no compromise with the security of the country
 unhen dhyaan rakhana chahie ki ye khaali pad bhi desh kii suraksha se samjhauta hi hai
 The comments 14 sitambar ke prime time main chalane ke baad bhi 20 sitambar tak inke maamle main kuch nahin hua he
 Similarly, youth are being tortured and made to wait

 Two years later, the order of the Supreme Court reached the CBI
 lekin 5 saal biit jane ke baad bhi yah mukadmaa anjaam par nahin pahunchaa he
 The Vyapam scam was to pass money to students by taking medical examination
 chargeshit main kai adhikariyon ke naam hai
 The chief minister also has names
 purv mukhyamantri digvijay singh ne 27 hazaar pannon kaa ricard pesh kiya he
 On September 22, Abhishek Manu Singhvi, p Chidambaram and Kapil Sibal are going to Bhopal for lobbying in this case

 Vyapam's condition is similar to that of many examinations and commissions

 ab ham aapako ek chart ke jariye samajhaate hai ki kaise ye sarkari chayan board naujavaanon ke saath dhokhaa kar rahe hai
 Delhi Subordinate Services Board had removed the vacancy for 803 posts, which was increased to 841 but only 554 were released
 kareeb 300 pad gaayab ho gaye
 In January 2014, the form for the fire operator came out
 31 agast 2014 ko pariksha hui
 From August 2014 to June 2016 Yu passed away
 kuch nahin hua
 It was followed by a physical test at the Chhatrasal Stadium between 17 June and 29 June
 1 sitambar 2017 se 22 sitambar 2017 tak driving kii pariksha hui
 Result came on 16 November 2017
 ek maamla court main jane kaa bhi he
 Some went to court and the post-results activity stopped
 isi sitambar main aadesh aayaa he ki jo rigelt niklaa he sahi he
 Now, the Delhi Subordinate Services Selection Board has sent dossiers of 350 youths to Delhi Fire Service
 baaki 197 chaatro ke abhi tak nahin bheje hai, jinhone haal hi main dharna diya tha
 2014 to 2018 arrived
 pariksha dene se lekar riselt nikalne tak
 Did not join isliye aapako lag saktaa he ki yah story boring he magar inaki zindagi main jhaank kar dekhie inkaa dam kaise ghut rahaa he
 In the prime time of September 14, we showed the agony of the youth who passed the examination of this Staff Selection Commission
 farvari 2018 main riselt aa gaya he magar saat maheene ho gaye jwining nahin hui
 More than 500 youth are waiting to join Military Engineering Services
 vaise kai press conference main mantri kehete sunai dete hai ki desh kii suraksha se koi samjhauta nahin ho saktaa he
 They should keep in mind that even these vacant posts are compromised with the security of the country
 tippaniyan Even after running in the prime time of 14 September, nothing has happened in their case till 20 September
 isi tarah tadapaa-tadapaa kar naujavaanon ko intazaar karaayaa ja rahaa he
 The country's Defense Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had also tweeted that it will look into the matter
 6 din guzar gaye
 Nothing has happened in this case yet
 inaki jwining kab hogi
 There are one to one scams in the recruitment commissions of the states
 magar madhya pradesh kaa vyapam ghotaalaa sabase krur tha
 The case came to light in 2013 and the first arrest was made in the same year
 do saal baad supreme court ke aadesh se sibiai ke paas pahunchaa
 But even after 5 years, this case has not reached its conclusion
 vyapam ghotaalaa medical pariksha main paise lekar chaatro ko paas karaane kaa tha
 The chargesheet has names of several officers
 mukhyamantri ke bhi naam hai
 Former Chief Minister Digvijay Singh has presented a record of 27 thousand pages
 22 sitambar ko abhishek manu singhvi, pi chidambaram or kapil sibbal is maamle main pairvi ke liye bhopal jane vaale hai
 The petition of Digvijay Singh, Prashant Pandey has once been dismissed from the Supreme Court
 vyapam kaa jo haal he vahi kai parikshaon or aayogon kaa he
 The case continues
 aaj kaa episod giridih ke sumit ko samarpit he
 i wish he could have waited a little longer
 sumit jaise lakhon noujvaan is khabar se dukhi hai
 He is tweeting from Prime Minister to Minister of various types on Twitter
 hona janaa kuch nahin he
 Something happens in one exam, 10 exams are stuck
 har sarkaar ke shram mantri ko har maheene ek report deni chahie
 How much vacancy came out, how many exam results are going to come out
 jwining kab hogi
 Its status report should come every month so that the fraud with the youth is stopped

 com / 72bx6dxph9— Parineeti Chopra (@parineetichopra)june 25, 2018filmon kii baat karen to priyanka jald salmaan khan ke saath 'bharat' kii shooting shuru karengi
 Ali Abbas Zafar is directing the film
 iske saath hi priyanka kii farhaan akhtar ke saath bhi ek film karne kii charchaa he
 Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi is vigorously campaigning in view of the Assembly elections in Gujarat
 vah jahaan bhi jate hai logon main unase milane kii hode dikh rahi he
 However, the most noticeable thing with Rahul during this entire Gujarat tour is his bag
 aam taur par espiji suraksha ke bich chalate netaaon ko khud apana saamaan uthaate nahin dekha jaataa, aise main rahul kaa yah bag pack soshal media par charchaa kaa vishay bana hua he
 When Rahul arrived at the airport for the third phase of the Navsarjan Yatra of the Congress in Gujarat, he placed this bagbag on his shoulder
 iske baad vah jahaan bhi jate yah bag unke saath hi dikhataa
 In such a situation, some people are praising their simplicity on social media about this bag, while some people are also describing it as a drama
 haalanki kuch yugers aise bhi hai jo jaanane chaahate hai ki rahul gandhi bag main kya lekar gum rahe hai
 According to information from sources, Rahul keeps some clothes and everyday items in his bag
 isamen mobile charger jaisaa jaruri saamaan bhi shaamil he
 During the election campaign, Rahul Gandhi wants to show himself connected with the public
 phir chaahe vah bharuch main mantsha naam kii chaatra ke saath selfi lenaa ho yaa phir saamaanya se hotel main logon kii bich baithkar bhojana karnaa
 These are all such things that he wants to convey to the people of Gujarat that he belongs among them and has a connection with the people
 rahul kii bag politics ko duniya ke un bade netaaon se jodakar bhi dekha ja rahaa he, jo janata ke bich bhisahajata se bartaavkarte hai
 When Obama was president, his pictures of shopping in a mall used to go viral on the same day, while the photo of UK PM David Cameron traveling in the London Metro was also very viral on social media
 bijepi lagaataar rahul gandhi ko raaj parivaar kaa bataakar un par nishaanaa sadhti rahati hai
 Perhaps it is the effect of this that now Rahul Gandhi is going out among the public by removing this tag and is trying his best to show himself attached to them
 lekin unki yah koshish kitni kaamyaab hoti he yah gujarat chunaav ke nattejey aane ke baad kii saaf hoga

 aam chunaav kii tazaa khabaron se apadet rahane ke liesbscribakaren ajtak kaa ellection special newzlator This is our temple, you are not allowed to worship in it
 kaaran: aap choti jati ke hai or ham aapse ucch jati ke
 It may sound strange to hear, but in the twenty-first century, it is true in the country that is filling up the Kulanche
 bihar ke navada jile ke sitamarhi ilaake main isaki kai misaalen maujuud hai
 This is confirmed by hearing the agony of Ramanuja Rajwanshi of Hasapur village of Nawada
 ramanuj bataate hai, ''maine betaa paidaa hone par gaanv ke mandir main mundan karaane kii mannath maangi thi
 Five months ago, when it was time for the vow to come, it was found that the arrival of people of my caste in that temple is strictly prohibited
 yahaan kii parampara rahi he ki oonchi jati ke log hi mandir main puja-archana kar sakate hai
 "so the carpenter woman of the village, who are considered to be higher than their caste, worshiped her instead
 jab tak puja sampann hui, ve mandir ke baahar hi khadey rahe
 The village of Ramanuja has the highest population of Rajvanshi caste, but the temple is dominated by the upper castes
 ve kehete hai, ''mandir main puja ko lekar pehle kabhi vivaad hua tha, uske baad se koi bhi ashaanti nahin chahta
 Therefore it has become a tradition
 '' ramanuj kaa maananaa he ki aisi hi pareshaaniyon kii vajah se rajwanshi samaaj ke purvajon ne sitamarhi main mahavir thakurbari kaa nirmaan karaayaa hoga, jahaan aaj na sirf puja-paath or shaadi-byaah kii jaruratein puri hoti hai balki saamaajik, rajnatik or shayhnnik utthan ke liye bhi kaam hote hai
 Ramanuja is not the only person who is compelled to follow such a tradition
 kai jatiyon main aisi misaal hai, jinaki jaruratein sitamarhi main puri ho rahi hai
 Sitamarhi, belonging to two and a half dozen castes like Ravidas, Bhuiyan, Chauhan, Tanti, Kushwaha, who have been victims of untouchability and discrimination in the name of religion, caste, high and low, have different temples and Thakurbari, which is their religious and social concern
 Are meeting needs
 yahi vajah he ki navada jila mukhyalay se 25 kilometre kii duuri par sthit yah ilaaka vanchit samaaj ke liye pramukh tirthasthal ban gaya he
 a fair is also organized here every year
 maheene bhar chalane vaale meley kii shuruyaat 17 disambar se hui
 Hundreds of people gather during the fair, where they talk about taking their society forward besides worship
 jahanabad ke mahant kailash das kehete hai ki bhagwaan sabake hai, lekin yah saamaajik buraaiyon kaa hi nateeja he ki log bhagwaan kii pujapath main bhi chuaachhut maanate hai
 This is also exploitation
 unke mutabik, ''hamaara uddeshy is bhedbhaav ko khatm karnaa he
 Nobody asks caste, so please Hari, it is Hari's
 yani bhagwaan ke bhajan main jaat-paat nahin dekhi jaati
 "now take manjhi-bhuiyan to the society
 is samaaj ke log bhi acchhee-khaasi taadaad main rahete hai
 But even this caste has not been free from the curse of untouchability
 hisua ke cathir gaanv ke kapil dev maanjhi bataate hai, ''bhagwaan kisi ke vash main nahin hai, phir bhi gaanv ke devi mandir main unki jati ke logon ke pravesh kii parampara nahin he
 "the place of worship of Shriram and Shabri in Sitamarhi is useful for their society
" bhuiyaan samaaj shabari ke bade mandir kaa nirmaan karvaa rahaa he, jisaki neenv 'mountain main' dasharath maanjhi ne rakhi thi
 Former Union Minister and National President of Scheduled Caste Morcha of BJP and Professor in Social Welfare Department of Patna University, Dr
 sanjay paswan kaa maananaa he, ''hindu dharm kii raksha karne main vanchit samaaj sabase aage rahaa he, jinhone vidharmiyon se ladakar bhi apane dharm kii raksha kii he
 There is also a Jarasandha temple of Chandravanshi society in Sitamarhi
 is mandir main jaraasandh ke alaava shrikrishna, arjuna or bhim kii murtiyon sthapit hai
 It has been constructed through Srichandravanshi Kshatriya Mahapanchayat Samiti Kolkata
 sthaneey samiti ke sachiv sujith singh chandravanshi kehete hai, ''jaraasandh kaa desh main aisa akelaa mandir sitamarhi main hi he
 The priests of the cave temple bearing the idol of luv-kush with Sita are Brahmins
 pujari seetaram pathak kehete hai, ''varshon se mere purvaj is mandir ke pujari rahe hai, lekin is mandir main pravesh par kisi jati kii pabandi nahin he
 There is a religious belief about Sitamarhi that it has been Sita's exile site
 kivdanti he ki sita nirvaasan kaal main sitamarhi main hi rahi thim, jahaan lav-kush kaa janm hua tha
 In front of the cave temple, it is said about the rock that is divided into two parts, that Sita was absorbed into the earth in the middle of this rock
 sitamarhi main mescor prakhand ke barat gaanv nivasee ravidaas jati kii bacchee das or unke pati suresh das kii aasthaa gaur karne laayak he
 Bachchi Das says, "who does not want to do devotion to God, but such freedom was not in my in-laws
 lekin main yahaan pichley 25 saal se pati ke saath shiv kii bhakthi main judi he
 Sujit Singh Chandravanshi of Hisua says that in the villages where the upper castes are dominated, Dalits have been oppressed and neglected in the name of backward and backward religion, in the same way, Sitamarhi has become a medium of liberation for the people
 dow
 Paswan says, "the society deprived of the country, religion and earth has always worked to cherish it
 unhone dharmantaran se bhi parhez kiya
 Sitamarhi is a living example of the same order, which has been cherished for centuries
 ''beshak samaaj or samudaay ke logon ne vivaad kii raah se bachane ke liye is raah ko chunaa he, par isamen koi shubahaa nahin ki ye mandir kisi tarakkee nahin balki sadiyon se chali aa rahi chuaachhut kii parampara se upji pidaa ke pratik hai
 You must have heard people say that whatever is excessive, it results in bad results

 Before eating anything, you should know very well what you are eating at what time, how and according to what

 Here is a mention of some nutritious things that eating too much and incorrectly can be harmful: 1
 gaajarakya aap jaanate hai ki bahut adhik gaajar khaanaa aapke liye khatarnaak sabit ho saktaa he? isse sharir main beta-caroten kii maatra bahut adhik ho jaati he
 This causes the blood to become very thick and the skin color changes
 yun to gaajar ek phydemand cheez he lekin iskaa ati seven nuksaandeh ho saktaa he
 2
 coffeebahut adhik coffee pine kaa sidhaa asar tantrika-tantra par padataa he
 This can cause problems like insomnia, muscle spasms and nervousness
 ek din main do cap se adhik coffee pinaa nuksaandeh ho saktaa he
 3
 machhlee kaa telbahut adhik maatra main omega 3 fatty acids ke seven se khun patala ho jaataa he
 It has a direct effect on health
 adhyayanon main kaha gaya he ki isse vitamin e kii vishaaktata ho sakati he
 There may be visual problems and tremors
 haalanki yah behad phydemand he lekin iske ati seven se kai samasyaayein ho sakati hai
 4
 dalacheeneedalacheenee bhartiya vyanjanon kaa ek khaas ansh he
 But its excessive intake can cause liver damage
 pratidin ke isaki maatra kii baat karen to ek din main do gram se adhik dalacheenee kaa seven karnaa khatarnaak ho saktaa he

 Senior BJP leader Subramanian Swamy claimed on Sunday that the issue of construction of a Ram temple at the disputed site in Ayodhya would be resolved by the end of this year
 yahi nahin, unhone yah bhi kaha ki vah is maamle par muslim netaaon se vyaktigat rup se baat karenge
 Swami was giving a lecture on the 175th anniversary of the public reading room in Nashik

 He said, 'the issue of construction of the disputed site Parram Temple in Ayodhya in Uttar Pradesh will be resolved by the end of 2016 and i will personally talk to members of the Muslim community including the Waqf Board and Asaduddin Owaisi to explain the issue

 If the journalists are to be believed then there is hooliganism and obstinate attitude of the BJP behind doing this
 darasal un bhaajapa kaaryakartaaon ko nilambit karne kii maang ko lekar patrkaar ade hai jin par do sthaneey patrakaron ke saath marpet karne kaa aarope he
 On the other hand, the state level leadership of BJP says that we can send notices to the allegedly guilty workers but suspending them is not in our hands
 rajya main patrakaron or bhaajapa ke netaaon ke bich thanathani kaa daur jari he
 On January 24, Anil Jain was incensed at the discussion on the bjp's defeat in the state
 baad main rajya main netaa pratipaksh dharmalaal kowshik ne baatcheet kar masale ko sambhala
 Now the latest case is of state journalist Suman Pandey on 2 February
 inkaa aarope he ki raipur ke bhaajapa karyaalay main kaaryakartaaon ke bich ho rahe jhagade kaa video banaate samay inke saath marpet kii gai
 Praful Thakur, vice-president of Raipur Press Club, said that there was actually an assembly level review meeting going on there
 sabhi patrakaron ko party kii media cell ne khud massej kar bulaayaa tha
 Reportedly Suman Pandey, a victim of assault, also reached there
 sabhi patrakaron kii tarah ve news cover kar apane daftar pahunche hi the ki unhen phone aayaa ki bhaajapa karyaalay main kisi baat ko lekar jhagada ho gaya he
 His office is close to the office
 ve maukey par pahunche or video banane lage
 But some activists present objected
 jila adhyaksh rajeev agarwal or unke saath kuch kaaryakartaaon ne unase video dilit karne ko kaha
 When Suman Pandey told him that he was a journalist
 unka kaam khabaron ko cover karnaa he
 They are doing their work
 lekin tabhi suman pandey ke saath vahaan maujuud unke saathi patrkaar par kaaryakartaaon ne hamaal bol diya
 Suman Pandey deleted the video to save the beating fellow journalist
 baavjood iske rajeev agarwal to vahaan se chale gaye lekin baaki bache kuch kaaryakartaaon ne unki pitayee shuru kar di
 However, only a few BJP workers rescued them and drove them out
 jabaki netaa pratipaksh dharmalaal kowshik kii maane to yah puri ghatana waisi nahin he jaisaa ki patrkaar bataa rahe hai
 Actually, the version of the incident that the activists present on the occasion has brought to them is like this, the district level review meeting was going on, allegedly the victim journalists reached the meeting
 ve vahaan party kii samiksha baithak main shaamil ho gaye
 When a worker asked him his identity, first he called himself a Congress worker and then a journalist
 unase bhaajapa kaaryakarta ne unka pahchaan patr maanga to patrkaar ne dene se manaa kar diya
 The activists got angry and asked to delete the video, the refusal increased
 karrwai ke sawaal par kowshik kaa kahana he ki kaaryakartaaon ke khilaaf karrwai kiye jane ke aashwaasan ke baad bhi patrakaron kaa gussa shant nahin ho rahaa he
 We have also assured to send notices to the alleged convicts
 party ke rashtriya str ke alaakaman netaaon tak baat pahunchane kii baat bhi kahi he
 But journalists demand that the activists be expelled immediately
 kowshik ke mutabik kaaryakartaaon ko nishkasit karne kaa faisla ve nahin le sakate
 Prafulla Thakur, on the other hand, says that the matter is further than just a journalist in office
 darasal jab bhaajapa netritv dharne par baithe patrakaron kii is maang par bhi raji nahin hua ki doshi kaaryakarta maafee maang len to hamane jila adhyaksh rajeev agarwal, vijay vyas, dean dongare, utkar, trivedi ke khilaaf exiar kii
 The arrest was made after much pressure
 lekin unki rihaai bhaajapa kaaryakartaaon ne phool maale ke saath karwaai
 Not only this, about 100 activists reached there with rods and poles to kill the journalists sitting on the dharna
 vah to acha he ki patrakaron kii sankhya unase kahin zyada thi
 So we survived
 prafull kaa kahana he ki agar ve notice bhejne ko taiyaar the to kya ghatana ke das din baad bhi unhone notice bheja he? rajya patrkaar sangh kaa kahana he ki agar is ghatana ko yun hi jane diya to aage har party patrakaron ke saath badasluki karegi
 It is a fight for respect, till the culprits are expelled from the party, we will keep on agitating
 haalanki prafull thakur bhaajapa ke saath-saath congress kii patrakaron ke saath kii vaadakhilaphi kaa bhi zikr karte hai
 In fact, the Congress had promised that if it came to power it would immediately enact a journalist protection law
 lekin do maheene bitne ke baad kanoon banane ke liye cameti kaa gathan tak nahin ho paaya he
 He says, if the law for the protection of journalists was in the state, then journalists would not have been forced to leave their work and agitate

 ’ In the Great Indian Political Theater, the curtain is falling quickly, rising
 manch par kirdaaron kii aisi bhagdad he ki janata samaj hi nahin paa rahi ki nayak koun he or vidooshak koun
 One day there is a spot light on Modi, and on the other day Advani is seen pushing his fist
 jab tak najar tehre, peeche se nitish ke sher gunjane lagate hai
 In such a situation, it is necessary to carefully examine the statement of each person and the intent behind it, weighed twice, so that the real weight is revealed
 philhal khabaron ke ghere main hai nitish kumaar
 For the last two days, he has been giving different capacities to his decision to leave BJP
 magar in bayanon ke baad bhi nitish kaa ek sach rahegaa
 Standing on the foundation of their past
 or is sach se nitish ke teen haalia jhooth dhahte se dikhte hai
 1 BJP does not respect its elders
 Nitish Kumar used to be a leader of Bihar who was identified as a member of Lalu's team Obosi
 teen baar chunaav haarane ke baad vah vidhansabha kii shakl dekh paae the
 With the blessings of Lalu and other socialist leaders of the state, he also became the Minister of State at the Center during the 1989 VP Government
 iske baad janata dal main sirf or sirf lalu raaj chalaa
 Mulayam Singh Yadav got separated earlier and later more factions separated
 tab nitish ko kuch sujh nahin rahaa tha
 George Fernandes, who had earned a place in the country's memory as a real angry young man through the first rail strike of the Emergency, then gave him a political vision
 bihar ko lalu kii soshal ejineering ke paar le jane kaa vijan
 This thinking aligned the two and laid the foundation of the Samata Party
 nabbe ke dashak main pehali baar laga ki pichde varg kaa ek netaa haath main mashaal lekar na sirf lalu ke ‘pichhadaa ko dekhakar jalte hai sab’, jaise kamiyon ko chupaane vaale naare ko jameendoj kar degaa, balki samaajwaad ke bigade hulie ko bhi sanvaaregaa
 But Nitish remained a farm
 buree tarah haare
 Once again George's foresight showed him the way and after the initial hesitation the party joined the BJP and became part of the NDA
 nitish ko kamobesh ek dashak ke baad phir satta sukh mila
 When the ministerial position came in hand, railway ravines started to be distributed in Bihar
 magar railway chalaane ko lekar nitish kaa kaushal kabhi kaabil zikr nahin ho paaya
 Meanwhile, in the year 2000 assembly elections were held in Bihar
 nitish kii samta party ko 34 siten milin, jabaki bijepi ko 67
 Yet it was George's skill that the NDA decided to project Nitish further as the leader of the alliance and future CM
 phir aayaa ek bada siyaasi mode
 In Bihar, JDU, the other constituent of the Janata Dal running without Lalu, also came with the NDA
 iske baad neenv padi samta party or janata dal ke is dhade ke mail kii
 These socialists standing in bjp's court had now become a trio
 jorge, sharad or nitish
 But then Nitish understood that George was no longer of much use
 haalat ye ho gai ki 2004 ke chunaav main jorge ko apni paramparaagat nalanda seat chhodane ke liye majaboor hona padaa
 He was pushed to Muzaffarpur
 nitish unki is seat se chunaav jeet loksabhaa pahunche
 After this, Nitish in his own way provided the power, power and balance
 centre kii dling sharad yadav ke hawaale kar di gai or state main apane sipahasaalar tainaat kar die gaye
 George and his partner Jaya Jaitley, once the top leaders of the Samata Party, were sidelined
 kuch hi barason main jorge pehle nepathy or phir beemaari ke bistar par chale gaye
 Nitish continued to repair the caste system in Bihar
 2005 kii farvari main bihar main chunaav hue, to endie gathbandhan sabase bade dal ke rup main ubhara, magar bahumat kaa aankada abhi bhi dur tha
 When elections were held again in November 2005, the alliance led by Nitish emerged victorious
 jashn hue samaajwaadiyon ke is dhade main, magar isamen jorge nahin the
 This whole story is because Nitish said in Patna on Monday that BJP is not respecting its elders, is deviating from the path shown by them
 2 dangaiyon ke saath nahin ja sakate hai hamanithish kumaar ko bijepi se parhez nahin he, narendra modi se he
 The reason, the riots in Gujarat under Narendra Modi
 saal tha 2002 kaa
 Nitish Kumar was the railway minister at that time
 ye sab jaanate hai ki dangon kii shuruyaat godhra main rail bogi jalaae jane ke baad hui
 Now Nitish, who spoke of morality, did not say anything then
 satta ke shahad main apane donon pair ragadate rahe
 a more solid stand was taken by Ram Vilas Paswan of Bihar, who resigned from the NDA on this issue
 modi saporter ek video in dinon khub share kar rahe hai
 It was shot in Gujarat
 mauka tha kisi railway project kii shuruyaat kaa
 Chief Minister Modi was accompanied by Railway Minister Nitish on the dais
 nitish ne kaha ki mujhe ummid he ki desh ko ek din narendra bhai kii sevaayen milengi
 Today, when Nitish's brother has come to serve in the changed political situation, he is sneezing
 ve naam lene se batch rahe hai, magar unke daanv ko na samajhane vaale ko anaadi bhi kah rahe hai
 His explanation on the video is that he was praised for the protocol
 kuch dinon main agar nitish congress kii god main baith jaaen or upie ke vikaas kii tarif karne lagen, to ise bhi protocol ke hi chashme se padhaa jaae
 And speaking of rioters, Nitish forgets that Advani, whom he is referring to as the secular face of NDA today, had a series of riots in the country after his matador was made a chariot
 adwani kii rathyatra somnath se nikali thi or jahaan jahaan se guzar rahi thi, vahaan baad main sampradayik jhadpon kii khabaren aa rahi thim
 Lalu then arrested Advani in Bihar
 tab nitish lalu ke khaas sakha the, ranneetik hissedaar the
 But they all forgot
 lekin ab unhen apane nae soshal ejineering ke frem main muslim voter anivaary rup se feet karne hai
 Modi's inflow can be attributed to this scheme
 so vah tyaag kaa tark garh rahe hai
 The renunciation of the partner to show strict attitude against communalism
 or sanad rahe, isliye yah bhi jaan len ki nitish aakhri baar modi ke saath saajha manch par 2009 main najar aae the
 The occasion was the NDA rally in Ludhiana, Punjab
 us raile ke pehle bhi bada shor tha ki nitish aa rahe hai, magar is shart par kii modi na aaen
 The noise was lost in the numbness and both came
 modi ne nitish ko bihar kii krishi kranti kaa janak kaha
 Nitish not only smiled at this, but he also folded his hands in greeting
 raily ke baad donon ne haath tham tasviren bhi khinchaai
 When these pictures were printed, when Lalu & Company started a shameful campaign for Nitish's secular attitude, he realized that NDA is fine but not Modi
 uske baad se ye ‘tumhiin se muhabbat, tumhiin se ladaai’ vaala ravaiya shuru hua
 Where is the good governance Babu to give the name of rioter to Ruswai? 3 modi kii mahatvakanksha par tippanee, par nitish for piem kaa kyanithish kumaar kii teesri dikkat ye he ki vah apni rajnatik mahatvakanksha ko hameshaa saat simton main lapete rahete hai
 So far he has not made any open statement about his claim in national politics
 puure media main, desh main narendra modi ke paksh-vipaksh main vimarsh chal rahaa he
 Poll surveys are also revolving around Modi and Rahul Gandhi
 aise main nitish for piem kaise mumkin ho
 For this, his political advisors have prepared a road map
 urban voter vikaas kii baat karegaa, to aankade uchhaalate raho, bihar kii halaat badalane kii baat karte raho
 Talk about federal interests, turn the eyes on the center, so that the regional parties in power in other states are comfortable with you, find your own credentials in you
 sampradayikta ke mudde par bijepi kaa saath chodo
 If some forward voters go, go, Muslim voters will make up that deficiency
 agar 20-25 siten bhi le aae, to fedral frand kii seedhi saamne hogi
 It would be good to see that no one gets a clear majority in 2014
 agar desh ke mood par jaaen to endie upie ko peeche chhod degaa, magar bahumat se dur rahegaa
 Then, as in 1996, the lottery will look like the third fund, which is being called the Federal this time
 mamata abhi bengal main hi itani ghiri hai ki centre main daavedaari kii soch bhi nahin saktin
 Congress will also veto in his name
 jayalalita ne kabhi centre par kabiz hone kii manshaa kaa sanket bhi nahin diya
 The Left has not yet decided which front it is
 kuch chote players hai, jinke paas dahaai main sankhya bhi shaayad na ho paae
 In such a situation, Nitish feels that the Modi for PM bus slogan will remain and he will become the next Deve Gowda in the country
 unhen bharosa he ki bijepi chhodane kii vajah se congress bhi baahar se saport ke dauraan unki daavedaari par vito nahin karegi
 The name of politics is just to move forward on the backbone of ambition
 magar kam aj kam ye bayaan to diya jaae ki haa, ham bhi daavedaar hai
 So that the game remains open
 nitish isse parhez kar rahe hai or saath hi endie kii satta kaamanaayon kaa bhi kam or zyada bharpoor majaak bana, congress kii najar main apni sambhaavnaaen pukhta kar rahe hai

 At the Ayodhya entrance gate at a distance of a few steps from the Beniganj intersection of the city Faizabad, the footstep of Ramacharitmanas's Sunderkand is written: 'prabisi Nagar Kije Sab Kaja
 hriday rakhi kosalpur raja
'bhavarth yah he ki ayodhyapuri ke raja bhagwaan ram ko hriday main rakhte hue nagar main pravesh karne se kathin se kathin kaary aasaani se sampann ho jaataa he
 In this city of Ayodhya, Ram's name is once again on the test
 pravesh dwaar se takreeban paanch kimi dur ramsevakpuram main 'shri ram janmabhumi nyaas' kii kaaryshaala main 20 disambar kii shaam chaar baje, rajasthan main bharatpur ke paas maujuud bansi kii pahari se 'sand stone' kii khep kaa achaanak pahunchnaa ek sahaj ghatana nahin thi
 The ban on stone mining in Bansi hill since 2007 was lifted in 2013 following a court order
 roak hatane ke do saal baad achaanak pattharon kaa ayodhya kii kaaryshaala pahunchnaa, shri ram janmabhumi nyaas ke karyaadhyaksh mahant nritygopal das kaa pattharon kii puja karnaa or isse pehle 7 se 10 disambar tak vishwa hindu parishad (vihip) ke mahaamantri or mandir nirmaan kaaryshaala ke pramukh chanpat raay kaa yahaan deraa daalana mahaj sanyog nahin tha
 It was part of a well-thought-out script of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), which has once again started assessing the fertility of the Ram temple issue in Ayodhya's laboratory
 bihar chunaav main bijepi kii haar or vihip ke sangrakshak ashok singhl ke dehanth ke baad ayodhya main achaanak ram mandir nirmaan kaaryshaala kii gatividhi kaa baduya kai ranneetik sanket de rahaa he
 The VHP wants to show that the Ram temple movement has not cooled down yet after Singhal's death
 mandir nirmaan ke liye kuch pathar ayodhya bhejkar sangh hawa ke rukh ko bhaanp rahaa he taaki yah pataa lagaaya ja sake ki mandir mudde main abhi kitni tapish baaki he?sangh kii badi sakriyata kii kaat ke liye pradesh main sattarudh sapa bhi sidhe taur par utar chuki he
 In the same Ayodhya saints, Mulayam Singh Yadav was given the title of 'mulla Mulayam' by the then Chief Minister and SP National President Mulayam Singh, who ordered firing on karsevaks during the Ram Mandir movement
 23 november ko 77 varsh ke hue mulaayam singh kaa ayodhya-faijabad main 77 divasiy janmotsav manaaya ja rahaa he
 The day begins with a special havan program at the temple of Jalpa Devi, situated on the border of Ayodhya, in which the people of the Muslim community, besides saints and saints, offer sacrifices in the havana with a vaccine on the forehead
 iske baad din bhar kambal vitaran, raktadan, goshtee jaise kaaryakramon ke jariye mulaayam singh ko sabhi virgon ke hitaishi ke rup main pesh kiya jaataa he
 It is clear that the Ayodhya assembly seat has once again become a question of prestige between the BJP, which had lost its face in Ayodhya in the last assembly elections and the SP which lost badly in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 abhi or garmayega mandir muddyah bhi mahaj sanyog nahin he ki bijepi ne faijabad ke saansad lallu singh ko danga peedit jile mujffarnagar main party ke sanghathanaatmak chunaav kaa prabharee banaakar bheja he

 So far, the work of carving out 60 per cent of the stones required for temple construction has been completed
 gujarat se aae suparvizer girish bhai sompura kehete hai, ''pichley aath saal ke dauraan kaaryshaala main pathar na aane se kaam dhimaa ho gaya tha
 Now the number of craftsmen will be increased soon after the arrival of new stones

 After the demolition of the Babri Masjid in 1992, as the situation in Ayodhya became normal on the international scene, there was an increase in the number of domestic and foreign tourists
 isi dauraan yahaan guide ke vyavsaay ne bhi jor pakadaa
 Today, more than 70 percent of the guides present in Ayodhya are between 19 and 23 years of age, who were born after the Babri Masjid demolition incident
 ye yuva padhai ke saath-saath apana kharch chalaane ke liye guide kaa kaam bhi karte hai
 One of these, Manish Pandey, says, "the noise after the stone-pelting in Ayodhya has caused panic and suddenly the number of tourists has reduced by half
 ''sthaneey logon main aaj bhi mandir andolan ke dauraan lagane vaale karfu kaa khauf he
 Kanhaiya Gupta, who sets up a sweet shop outside Hanuman Garhi, says, "after years, the situation in Ayodhya has become normal
 vyavsaay patari par laut aayaa he
 The children started going to school in peace
 kisi bhi taraf se maahaul kharaab karne kii koshish ko janata maaf nahin karegi
 "the VHP leaders are also wary of the cold response received from the local public after the stone came to the workshop and are trying to step on the issue
" netaaon ko pehali baar yah mahasoos hone laga he ki is mudde par anaavashyak teji virodh main maahaul bana sakati he
 "we are all bound by the court's decision," says Purushottam Narayan Singh, member and mentor of the VHP Central Committee, which is camping in Karsevak Puram, 200 meters from the workshop

 The resentment of the local people against the party has increased due to most of the announcements of the Central Government not yet getting on the ground

 This is the first time such a senior officer with three stars is facing such action

 Kapoor's decision was overturned by Antony on Wednesday
 unhone sena pramukh ke kareebi samajhe jane vaale prakaash ke khilaaf prashasnic karrwai kii bachaay anushaasanamak karrwai karne kaa nirdesh diya tha
 This was the first time that the Defense Minister overturned the decision of the Army Chief in a disciplinary case

 iske baad antni ne yah poocha ki sainya kanoon ke tahat samaan aparaadh ke maamle kii jaanch main doshi paye gayi adhikariyon ko alag-alag tarah se dandit kyon kiya gaya
 Antony also advised for disciplinary action against Prakash

 This certificate was given despite the objections of former officers of the 33rd Corps
 agarwal ne sena ko yah ‘galat’ jaankaree di thi ki vah ajmer sthit mayo college se sambhddha ek shaikshanik santhaan kii vahaan sthapana karenge
 The investigation allegedly stated that Rath was guilty of signing a settlement form with Aggarwal, under which the children of the military officers serving in the military station had agreed to allot some percentage of seats in the educational institution
 sainya sachiv hone ke kaaran prakaash hi thalsena main sabhi adhikariyon kii niyukti or tainaati karne ke prabharee hai
 Therefore, he is considered an empowered associate of the Army Chief

 He did not inform his top officials of the developments in the military station in connection with the issue of NOC

 He allegedly played an 'active role' in the negotiations with Agrawal in the issue of NOC during his tenure as Brigadier (administration) under Rath in the 33rd Corps

 The English newspaper 'the Economic Times' reported this
 jediu se jude sheersh sutron ke mutabik jithan ram maanjhi ko hataakar nitish kumaar yaa udai choudhary ke mukhyamantri banane ke kayaas lagaae ja rahe hai
 Apart from this, Abdul Bari Siddiqui of the RJD could get an important post with Misa Bharti being made the Deputy Chief Minister
