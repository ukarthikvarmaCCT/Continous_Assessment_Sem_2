 These people stayed in the shadow of death for 16 days

 Do not be surprised this is true and this is true

 The father of Columbia Space Shuttle flight engineer Kalpana Chawla has also rejected it

 Commenting on the finalization of the seat sharing between JDU, LJP and BJP in Bihar for the 2019 general election, Thackeray said, "(JDU chief) Nitish Kumar and (LJP chief) Ram Vilas Paswan have got Ram temple and Hindutva But you should declare your opinion

 bihar ke mukhyamantri or jediu netaa nitish kumaar vidhansabha chunaav main bhartiya janata party ke saath gathbandhan main chunaav nahin ladenge
 This is to say that Munna Tiwari, Congress MLA from Buxar, Bihar
 unhone apni party ke alaava argedy main bhi badi tut kaa daawa kiya he
 MLA Tiwari said that Nitish Kumar will be the chief face of the equation that will be formed after a big break in the Congress and the RJD
 vaise bihar main bijepi or jediu gathbandhan kii sarkaar chal rahi he or donon partiyon ne algepi ke saath milakar 2020 kaa vidhansabha chunaav ladane kaa elaan bhi kar diya he

 lekin baxur ke congress vidhayak munna tiwari ke is daawey kii vajah se bihar kii raajnneeti garmane kii puri ashanka he
 The MLA himself has claimed that there will be a big breakdown in the Congress
 jabaki netritv-viheen argedy ko lekar yah pehle se kayaas lagaae ja rahe hai ki party ke adhiktar vidhayak apni nai jameen talashne main lage hai
 The MLA also claimed that he has strong information that RJD and Congress mlas are in constant touch with Nitish Kumar

 is baar bihar main nayaa sameekaran banegaa or is nae sameekaran ke saath nitish kumaar apane dam par chunaav ladenge
 It is difficult to say how much power is there in the claim of the MLA, but the politics of Bihar can take many turns till the assembly elections

 If a story collides with someone else's story, many times a completely new story is created
 ham pehle aapako 2009-10 ke australia main le janaa chaahate hai jab vahaan bhartiya chaatro par hamale hone lage the
 In Australia and India, there was a discussion that why there are sudden attacks on Indian students in the country where 140 people live
 ek bhartiya chaatr kii hatya ho gai thi or duusare ko melbern main jalaakar maarane kii koshish hui thi
 At that time there was tension in diplomatic relations between India and Australia, now everything is normal
 phir se austrailia jane vaale bhartiya chaatro kii sankhya badhane lagi he
 The bbc's Sautik Vishwas then wrote that the Indian TV media became aggressive about Australia, but in any report, whether it was the Indian media or the Australian media, there was no serious investigation into the reasons for the attack
 us vakt ke tivi channelon par australia ke bare main likhaa jaataa tha ki vah ek naslbhedi racist mulk he
 Melbourne is the most racist city in the world
 aap yakeen nahin karenge melbern age ke sampadak ne likhaa tha ki koi bhi insaan purna nahin hota he
 He can be selfish, hate, feel happy to hurt and even kill
 ye 2009-10 kaa australia kaa media tha jo aaj kaa bharat main soshal media kaa ek hissaa he
 At that time it was said in Australia media and blog posts that Indian students are responsible
 baad main maaikel baas kaa ek research paper padhate hue pataa chalaa ki australia main bhartiya chaatro kii sankhya badhati ja rahi thi
 Australia used to earn from this as well
 donon mulkon ke media ne ekadusre ke prati kadaa rukh akhriyaar kar liya tha
 Australia used to call India racist, then Australia was racist from India
 jaisaa ki aajkal hota he
 Now a story comes out of this story
 ek film bani he 'da color aaf darkeness'
 The English-made film also has 20 percent Gujarati
 gujarati isliye kyonki is film ke nirdeshak girish makvaana bhi gujarat ke hai
 The story of the film begins with Tundel, a village in Gujarat and merges into an attack against Indian students in the city of Melbourne in 2009
 is film ko aap aaj ke samay main bhi dekh sakate hai ki kaise kisi ghatana ko donon deshon kaa media apana apana rang dete hai or hinsa kii jad tak pahunchane kii jagah, uskaa istamaal karte hai, apni raajnneeti ke liye
 Color differences, race differences and caste differences are not separate words for Makwana
 hinsa kii yah beemaari alag-alag naam se har tarah ke samaaj main maujuud he
 First you watch the video of the film, it will be some idea how much Girish Makwana has made the film
 ek nirdeshak ke taur par camere par unki kitni pakad he or sangitgaar ke rup main unhone kya kamaal kiya he
 This success of Girish Makwana can be an example for socially backward sections
 ham sab jamaane dekhte aae hai ki yashraj kii film jab shuru hoti he kaise unka signechar parde par aakaar lete hai
 See the name of Girish Makwana
 jis andaaz se parde par aakaar letaa he, wo ek dastak he, ki yah filmkaar yaheen nahin rukne vaala he
 Girish Makwana weavers come from the society
 unke pita kanti mangal vankar ne jatigat bhedbhaav ke kilaaf awaz uthaai thi
 We will talk about the incident of 1965 when Mangal Bhagat said that Enough, just not anymore
 girish makvaana ne is film ko apane dada ji mangalabhai premabhai makvaana ke naam samarpit kiya he
 Grandpa is no longer in this world to see his grandson's magic, but through this film, the grandson has brought his grandfather across the world
 polio ke shikaar girish makvaana ke hunar ko pakadana he, samajhnaa he, to is film main likhe gaye unke gane, gane kaa sangeet or uske filmakan ko mahasoos kiijie
 The comments usase pehle yah bhi jaan lijie ki girish makvaana ke paas music parformens main bachaler or master kii degree he
 She has a phd in Music Composition
 australia main bhartiya sangeet kii samskruti kaa koob prachaar-prasar bhi kiya he
 In 2010, Girish Makwana holds a diploma in film and TV production and then a master's degree before taking the step towards film making
 color aaf darkeness kaa promo video dekhakar lag jaataa he ki filmkaar ne vaise hi drishy, sangeet or samvaad kii vaise hi bunai kii he jaise hathkarghe par koi bunakar kapade kii bunai karata he
 It is a festival of light, on this occasion we are going to talk about the color of darkness
 color aaf darkeness
 Within the society, it is important to know the elements of violence within us, otherwise we will not know when the blood will be on us
 abhinayta sahil saluja ne bataaya he ki research ke dauraan jab wo samaaj ke is hakeekat se guzara ki aaj bhi karodon logon ko jati kaa dansh jhelana padataa he, to uski soch hi nahin, zindagi bhi badal gai
 The film has received several awards
 australia or bharat main charchaa hone lagi ki jis mulk main 140 mulkon ke log rahete hai vahaan achaanak bhartiya chaatro par hamale kyon ho rahe hai
 One Indian student was killed and another was tried to burn him in Melbourne
 us vakt bharat or australia ke bich ke kootnithik sambandhon main bhi tanaav aa gaya tha, ab sab kuch saamaanya he
 The number of Indian students going to Australia has started growing again
 bibisi ke sautik viswas ne tab likhaa tha ki bhartiya tivi media australia ko lekar aakraamak to ho gaya magar kisi bhi report main chaahe wo bhartiya media ho yaa australian media, hamale ke kaarnon kii gambhir padtaal nahin thi
 On TV channels of that time, Australia was written that it is a racist racist country
 melbern duniya kaa sabase naslbhedi shahar he
 You wouldn't believe the editor of the Melbourne Age wrote that no human being is complete
 vah swaarthee ho saktaa he, nafrat kar saktaa he, dukh pahunchane main khushi mahasoos kar saktaa he or yahaan tak ki hatya karne main bhi
 This was the Australian media of 2009-10, which is a part of social media in today's India
 us samay australia media or blog post main kaha jane laga ki bhartiya chaatr hi zimmedaar hai
 Later, reading a research paper by Michael Bass, it was found that the number of Indian students in Australia was increasing
 isse australia kii kamai bhi hoti thi
 The media of both countries took a tough stand towards each other
 australia vaala bharat ko naslbhedi bolta tha to bharat se austrailia ko naslbhedi
 As it happens nowadays
 ab is kahani se ek kahani nikali he
 a film is made 'the Color of Darkness'
 angrezi main bani is film main 20 pratishat gujarati bhi he
 Gujarati because Girish Makwana, the director of this film is also from Gujarat
 film kii kahani gujarat ke ek gaanv tundell se shuru hoti he or 2009 main melbern shahar main bhartiya chaatro ke kilaaf ho rahe hamale main ghul mil jaati he
 You can also see this film in today's time, how the media of both countries give their color to an event and instead of reaching to the root of violence, use it for their politics
 makvaana ke liye rang bhed, nasl bhed or jati bhed alag-alag shabd nahin hai
 This disease of violence is present in every kind of society under different names
 pehle aap film kaa video dekhie kuch andaaza hoga ki girish makvaana ne kitni sadhi hui film banaai he
 As a director he has so much grip on the camera and what a wonderful job he has done as a musician
 girish makvaana kii yah kamyaabi saamaajik rup se pichde tabake ke liye misaal ho sakati he
 We have seen all the times that when Yash Raj's film starts, his signature takes shape on the screen
 girish makvaana ke naam kaa ji aap dekhie
 The way the screen takes shape is a knock, that this filmmaker is not going to stop here
 girish makvaana bunakar samaaj se aate hai
 His father Kanti Mangal Vankar had raised his voice against caste discrimination
 1965 kii ghatana ke bare main baat karenge jab mangal bhagat ne kaha tha ki inf, bas ab or nahin
 Girish Makwana has dedicated this film to his grandfather, Mangalabhai Premabhai Makwana
 dada ji apane pote ke is kamaal ko dekhne ke liye ab is duniya main nahin hai, magar is film ke zarie pote ne apane dada ji ko duniyabar main pahunchaa diya he
 If you want to catch the talent of polio victim Girish Makwana, then understand his songs written in this film, the music of the song and its filming
 tippaniyan Before that also know that Girish Makwana has a bachelor's and master's degree in music performance
 music compozishan main piechdi hai
 The culture of Indian music has also been widely publicized in Australia
 2010 main girish makvaana film banane kii disha main kadam badhaane se pehle film or tivi production main diploma or uske baad master degree hasil karte hai
 The promo video of Color of Darkness shows that the filmmaker weaves scenes, music and dialogue in the same way as a weaver weaving cloth on a handloom
 raushnee kaa tyohaar he, is maukey par ham andhere ke rang kii baat karne ja rahe hai
 Color of Darkness
 samaaj ke bheetar, apane bheetar maujuud hinsa ke tatwon ko jaananaa zaruri he, varna kab ham par koon savaar ho jayega, pataa nahin chalegaa
 Actor Sahil Saluja has told that during research, when he went through the reality of the society that even today crores of people have to bear the brunt of caste, then not only his thinking, life also changed
 is film ko kai puraskaar mil chuke hai
 The bbc's Sautik Vishwas then wrote that the Indian TV media became aggressive about Australia, but in any report, whether it was the Indian media or the Australian media, there was no serious investigation into the reasons for the attack
 us vakt ke tivi channelon par australia ke bare main likhaa jaataa tha ki vah ek naslbhedi racist mulk he
 Melbourne is the most racist city in the world
 aap yakeen nahin karenge melbern age ke sampadak ne likhaa tha ki koi bhi insaan purna nahin hota he

 At that time it was said in Australia media and blog posts that Indian students are responsible

 The English-made film also has 20 percent Gujarati
 gujarati isliye kyonki is film ke nirdeshak girish makvaana bhi gujarat ke hai
 The story of the film begins with Tundel, a village in Gujarat and merges into an attack against Indian students in the city of Melbourne in 2009
 is film ko aap aaj ke samay main bhi dekh sakate hai ki kaise kisi ghatana ko donon deshon kaa media apana apana rang dete hai or hinsa kii jad tak pahunchane kii jagah, uskaa istamaal karte hai, apni raajnneeti ke liye

 Now RSS mouthpieces have openly raised the issue of 'love Jihad'
 ab tak maukhik taur par uchhal rahaa ye vivaad pehali baar mukhpatr tak pahunchaa he
 Political agitation is also intensifying
 ‘lav jehad’ par ab tak ho rahi maukhik baaten aresas ke mukhpatr kii surkhiyaan bani to raajnneetik maahaul kaa garmana lajimi he
 Actually the RSS believes that only the game of conversion is taking place under the guise of love and marriage
 tabhi aresas ke mukhpatr panchajnya main jo tasviir chhaapi gai he wo sari kahani khud hi kah rahi he
 Fake pink heart in Arabic garb, goggles and beard and a smiled smile on his face

 ’vahiin aresas ke angreji mukhpatr organizer ke cover pej par jharkhand main lav jehad kii kathith peedit tara shahdev kii tasviir he
 That is, an attempt is being made to keep this game at the center of electoral politics, so that after the Modi wave, there will be a wave of 'love Jihad' in the upcoming elections

 It was discussed in social groups as well as with every partner organizations of the Sangh and BJP

 Political experts believe that by-elections are to be held in 11 assembly seats in UP and one seat vacant in Lok Sabha this month
 ye mudda isiilie uthaaya gaya he, taaki in chunaavon ke nateezon par iskaa asar hua to ek ke baad ek hone vaale vidhansabha chunaavon main ise jamkar bhunaaya ja sake

 'mere dalit bhaaiyon par waar karnaa band kiijie, agar waar karnaa he to mujh par hamalaa kiijie' pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa yah bhaashan aapako yaad he na
 From time to time, from Modi to the entire Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has been showing its Dalit love
 lekin, essi-asti act main badlaav ke baad savarnon ke nishane par ai modi sarkaar kai dalit netaaon netaaon kii naaraazgi jhel rahi he
 Before the Lok Sabha elections, BJP MP from Bahraich Savitri Bai Phule has resigned from the party
 khaas baat he ki unhone bijepi se parityag kaa nirnay samvidhan nirmaataa bhimrao ambedkar ke mahaparinirvana diwas par liya
 Savitri Bai Phule is not the only Dalit leader unhappy with the Modi government
 aise darjanon dalit netaa hai, jo gaahe-bagaahe apane sheersh netritv ko ankhen dikhaate rahete hai
 Ramdas Athawale, Union Minister and President of the Republican Party of India, Ramdas Athawale, increased the uneasiness in the BJP with a statement
 athavle ne kaha tha, 'congress ke naseem khan bol rahe hai ki tum hamaare saath aa jaao
 i stayed in Congress for 10-15 years, even here i have to stay for 15-20 years
 ' unhone kaha ki jab tak bijepi sarkaar he tab tak main yahaan rahoonga
 Athawale said, 'when i guess what direction the wind is in, then i will take a decision'
 athavle apni party ke iklaute saansad hai
 Udit Raj is the first name in this list
 indian justise party ke sansthaapak rahe udit raaj 2014 ke aam chunaav main kesariamay hue the or modi lahar main dilli kii uttar pashchim seat se saansad bane
 But in five years, he has opposed the Modi government through public forums on many issues
 80 se 90 fisadi tak aarakshan khatm hone kii baat kehete hue udit raaj ne apni hi sarkaar par unki baton ko ansuna karne kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 Earlier, Udit Raj has spoken that the Dalit ministers of Modi government have forgotten their duty towards the community
 is vajah se dalit samaaj bijepi se dur ja rahaa he
 Chhote Lal Kharwar BJP MP from Robertsganj in Uttar Pradesh has also expressed his displeasure with the BJP government led by CM Yogi Adityanath
 unhone piem modi ko ek chitthee likhi thi
 In this letter, he wrote, 'he has been raising voice against corruption in the Chandauli District Administration and Forest Department for the last three years
 jile ke aalaa adhikari unka utpeedan kar rahe hai
 The BJP MP met CM Yogi twice in the case, but the CM scolded him and drove him away
 ' vah siem yogi ke alaava bijepi pradesh adhyaksh mahendra nath pandeya or sanghathan mantri sunil bansal kii bhi shikaayat kar chuke hai
 However, Prime Minister Modi assured action on Kharwar's complaint
 iske baad se vah shant ho gaye
 But sometimes they keep raising the issue of Dalits
 kharwar 2014 chunaav se pehle sapa chhodkar bijepi main aae the
 Like Ashok Doher Chhotelal Kharwar, Ashok Doher, MP from Etawah in UP, has also voiced his anger against BJP leaders including CM Yogi
 beete dinon unhone piem modi ko patr likhakar kaha, '2 april ko 'bharat band' ke baad essi / asti varg ke logon ko uttar pradesh sahit duusare rajyon main sarkarein or sthaneey police jhuthe mukademe main fansaa rahi he
 They are being tortured
 ' unhone aarope lagaaya ki police nirdosh logon ko jatisuchak shabdon kaa istemaal karte hue gharon se nikaal kar marpet kar rahi he
 This has increased the feeling of anger and insecurity among these sections
 basapa sarkaar main mantri rahe ashok dohare bhi 2013 main bijepi main aae the or 2014 kaa chunaav jite
 Yashwant Singh, BJP MP from Nagina of Yashwant Singh UP, has also expressed his displeasure with the Modi government over Dalits
 jatav samaaj se aane vaale yashavanth singh ne modi sarkaar par aarope lagaaya tha ki unki ore se 4 saal main 30 karod kii aabaadi vaale dalit samaaj ke liye pratyaksh rup se kuch bhi nahin kiya gaya
 Demand to complete backlog, pass reservation bill in promotion, reservation in private jobs etc
 were not fulfilled
 unhone piem modi ko khat likhakar kaha tha ki bijepi ke dalit saansad pratadna ke shikaar ban rahe hai
 They are not able to answer the public on many issues
 ashok dohare kii hi tarah yashavanth singh bhi basapa sarkaar main mantri rah chuke hai or 2014 main hi bhaajapa kaa daaman thamkar saansad bane hai
 These leaders are important for the BJP, because they represent the party at 40 (including Bahraich) in the safe 80 seats of the country
 80 seat vaale uttar pradesh main sabhi 17 surakshit siton par bijepi ne 2014 main shandaar jeet darj kii thi
 Of these, Savitri Bai Phule broke off from the party
 2011 kii janaganana ke mutabik desh main daliton kii aabaadi kareeb 17 fisadi he
 Dalit voters play a very important role in the elections of Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Bihar, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh
 daliton kii siyaasi takat ko dekhte hue bijepi unhen paale main laane kii kavayad main lagi rahati he
 But the resentment of bjp's Dalit leaders is becoming a headache for him
 dalitahi nahin pichde netaa bhi narazkele dalit nahin bijepi ke liye loksabhaa chunaav se pichde netaaon ne bhi mushkilen badha di hai
 The Rashtriya Loksamata Party (RLSP), the regional party of Bihar, may differ from the NDA
 ralospa adhyaksh upendra kushvaha ne 2019 kaa chunaav bijepi ke saath na ladane kaa sanket dete hue kaha ki log hamaare bhavishya kii ranneeti ko lekar aas lagaae baithe hai

 In addition to Om Prakash Rajbharupendra Kushwaha, President of Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party in Uttar Pradesh and Om Prakash Rajbhar, a minister in the Yogi government also keep making statements against BJP
 pichhadaa varg ke netaa rajbhar ne bulandshahr hinsa par kaha ki unke (yogi) log danga bhadkaa rahe hai or ham shaanti kaa prayaas kar rahe hai
 This is not the first time Rajbhar has expressed his displeasure over the Yogi government
 bich main vah bijepi adhyaksh amit shah se mil chuke hai
 After this meeting regarding SC / ST Act, Rajbhar had said that Amit Shah has a big skull
 vah kah rahe the ki logon ko samajha lenge, lekin hamako nahin lagata, jab aag lag jaati he to daag to makaan main ho hi jaataa he

 From grabbing land to invading rebel disciples, from sexual exploitation of women to accumulating wealth from dubious sources, Asaram Bapu has been involved in all kinds of controversies, but his appetite for disputes is not as quiet
 pichley hafte is 73 varshiya baba ne rajasthan main tonk ke apane shivi ke manch se dilli balaatkaar maamle par kai besange bayaan dekar balaatkaar par chal rahi tikhi rashtriya bahes main hastkshep kiya or ek or vivaad ko nyotaa de daalaa
 His comments made Delhi's late rape victim guilty instead of the male criminals who raped the girl
 unhone kaha ki yadi us ladki ne saraswati mantra kaa paath kiya hota yaa unase diksha lee hoti to vah us bas par savaar hi na hui hoti
 Earlier, he said that if he had called rapists as brothers, he probably would not have raped her
 isi bich yah aapattijanak bayaan bhi de daalaa, ‘‘ek haath se tali nahin baj sakati
 "blind devotees of the controversial Guru have been taught that hell is bound to be met if the Guru is questioned
 lihaaja, unhone is bhayanak vivaad se unhen nikaalane kii bajaae unka bachaav kar use or bhayanak banane main hi yogadan diya
 As a spokesperson for Asaram, Neelam Dubey said, “baba's statements have been severely twisted
 ve peedita ko dosha nahin de rahe the balki sirf yah kah rahe the ki vah bhi kam-se-kam ek pratishat jimmedaar to thi hi kyonki usne aisi lagbhag khaali bas main chadhgaye kii galati kii thi jisamen ek bhi mahila maujuud nahin thi
 Asaram's statement was widely criticized but had no effect on Baba and he stood by his controversial statements opposing the idea of giving death penalty to rapists
 unhone tark diya, “iskaa istemaal deele-dhaale charitra kii mahilaon dwaara purushon ke viruddh thik usee tarah se kiya jayega, jaise sakht dahej virdohi kanoon kaa istemaal kuch mahilaayein apane patiyon ko pareshaan karne ke liye kar rahi hai

" ke samrajya vaale ek aadhyatmik guru ke rup main asumal thoumal harplani urf asaram baapu kaa utthan sachmuch kisi sapane jaisaa hi rahaa he
 Today, Asaram has no special count when it comes to the knowledge of the scriptures, but in terms of wealth, he is more than many gurus who give lectures today
 unke samrajya main bharat ke pramukh shaharon main yaa uske aas-paas mahatvapurn sthanon par hajaaron acre jameen or aadhyatmik patrikaon ke alaava ayurvedic dawa, agarbatti, shampoo tathaa sabun jaise do darjan se adhik utpaadon kaa ek faltaa-phulataa kaarobaar shaamil he, jisase unhen karodon ru

 Asaram was born in a village called Birani near Nawabshah in Sindh province of Pakistan
 bharat ke vibhaajan or pakistan ke nirmaan ke samay hue sampradayik dangon ke kaaran unke pita thoumal ko sindh se bhagkar kuccha or phir ahmedabad aane ke liye majaboor hona padaa
 Matric Fell Asaram was only seven years old then
 20 ke hone ke baad asaram, lilashah baba kaa aashirwad lene ke liye kuccha ke adipur main sthit unke ashram main gaye
 Leelashah Baba was a respected spiritual man and died in 1973
 kuccha ke sindhi bujurgon kaa kahana he ki lilashah baba apni mrityu ke samay asaram ko pasand nahin karte the, phir bhi asaram baapu ke anuyaayi yahi bataate hai ki lilashah hi unke guru the
 The bad phase for Asaram came between 2008 and 2010 when he and his son Narayan Sai faced charges such as sexual exploitation of women, sacrificing children for tantric purposes and land grabbing using violence
 lekin ye aarope sabit nahin ho paae
 Not only that, his accusations did not affect his image either, but his number of disciples either remained constant or increased in many places and independent observers along with his enemies were also surprised by the secret of his power
 
 jaisaa ki unke samarpit shishy udai sanghani kehete hai, ‘‘baapu ke khilaaf aarope aise asantusht logon ne lagaae hai jo baapu se kuch anuchit kaam karana chaahate the or jise ve kabhi nahin kara paae
 The number of his followers has increased because those who benefited from his spiritual experience with Bapu relied on his experience rather than the negative publicity of media based on false accusations and shared his feelings with new people
 ”udhaaharan ke liye gujarat ke anya pichde varg (obisi) se aane vaale 35 varshiya di
 s
 baaria kaa hi maamla lijie, jo asaram baapu ke samarpit anuyaayi hai or san francisco main ek computer vaigyanik ke rup main kaary kar rahe hai
 He is a symbol of a Khanty follower of Asaram
 unka kahana he ki asaram kii shikshaaon kii vajah se hi ve america ja paae or jivan main aage bad paae
 In his words, "the intensity of the negative campaign against him was far less than the intensity of the spiritual values that millions of people like me have inherited from him
" kisi anya cheez se adhik hamane unke saath ke apane anubhavon par bharosa kiya he
 Bapu has instilled a unique pride in our culture, religion and spirituality
 ”is dauraan baba ke rajnatik anuyaayiyon kii sankhya main bhi badhotaree hui dikhti he
 In 2011, he became the state guest of seven states, including the Congress and bjp-ruled states
 pichley do varshon ke dauraan jo mukhyamantri unase milane aae, unamem haal hi main himachal pradesh main haar kaa swaad chakhne vaale prem kumaar dhumal, chhattisgarh ke mukhyamantri raman singh, rajasthan ke ashok gahalot, madhya pradesh ke shivaraj singh chouhan or yahaan tak ki punjab ke netaa prakaash singh badal shaamil hai
 Influenced by Asaram Bapu's efforts to celebrate 'parents' Puja Day' against the western concept of Valentine's Day, the Raman Singh government declared 2011 Valentine's Day as' Parental Puja Day 'in Chhattisgarh
 ahmedabad main asaram baapu ke aahvaan par 60 skulon ne pichley vailemtine de ko mata-pita pujan diwas ke rup main manaaya
 Apparently, Asaram can be said to be controversial but highly influential among all spiritual gurus
 dilli main dengue or chikangunia ke na sirf marij badhate ja rahe hai, balkimaut kaa aankadabhi badhata ja rahaa he
 After this, government agencies have come into action

 Satish Upadhyay says that people are also being made aware by running special campaigns
 unhone kaha ki foging kaa kaam lagaataar jari he, aisa nahin he ki marijon kii taadaad badhane ke baad intjaam kiye gaye hon
 The official argued that - Chikungunya patient Puneet Kumar said that the MCD team has been involved in the campaign against dengue for the last four months
 unhonemchhar maaraneke abhiyaan main kisi bhi tarah kii deree se inkaar kiya
 He said that this time the rainfall in Delhi has been more and longer, as well as the number of chikungunya patients has come up all over the country, in such a situation, the MCD is trying to stop the mosquito breeding
 unki image romentic bhale na ho lekin darshakon ko unamem parfect 'prem' dikhataa he
 He may be involved in a legal case, but people see 'bhaijaan' in him
 box offis ke vah 'sultan' hai or filmmekars ke bich 'wonted'
 Whether someone is his fan or not, but no one has ever ignited his star power
 unki kismat or connections, donon hi itane strong bataae jate hai ki vah kisi kaa bhi kariyar bana-bigaad sakate hai
 But when it comes to thinking, Salman Khan has always proved to be a flop in this matter
 'sultan'kii shooting ke dauraan vah rape victim jaisaa mahasoos kar rahe the
 
 
 Such lewd jokes question his mentality
 kya salmaan yah bhul gaye ki jab unki pahani accessories youth main ek craij ban jaati he to apni is soch se vah unhen kya sikhayenge
 Salman's interview on which organically happened: http: / / goo

 After all, it is the same star who makes 'bodyguard' on screen but has badly beaten her ex-girlfriend Aishwarya

 If a boy in our circle does this, then tell us what our vision will be for him
 
 
 Being Human to bilkul nahin
 Perhaps this may be the reason that despite being the 'yuvraj' of girls in terms of choice, she is single till the age of 50
 lekin is maamle main galati hamaari bhi he
 When they beat Aishwarya, we kept quiet
 katrina ke saport main nahin aae
 In his hit and run case, the flock that sprang up as soon as he reached the court, he never questioned what the truth was
 chinkaara ko maarane ke cese main bhi nahin
 Anger is not right, but also not in belonging
 khan parivaar ke 'laadle bete' ne khud ko hameshaa real'sultan'mahasoos kiya or uske baad shaayad use laga ki vah kaise bhi majaak kar saktaa he
 After all, why would fans feel bad? 
 
 salmaan ko yah samajhnaa hoga ki bhale hi darshakon ne parde ke unke har rup ko dil main basaaya he
 Even if he cannot dance, cannot act, double the action body
 
 
 baavjood is sabake unki har film kamai kaa nayaa record bana rahi he
 The film may still earn that much but their lyrics have definitely tarnished their image
 jo bhi sochega, vah kharaab hi mahasoos karegaa

 Lalathanhawla is also the president of the party's state unit

 In the party's manifesto, he said that laptops will be given every year to those who pass the Class x examination and high-level students, when they come to power for the third consecutive time in Mizoram

 Three private companies of the country are responsible for the country's 80 million mobile subscribers
 vodaphone idia, bhartiya airtel or reliance jeeyo
 All three companies have announced to increase the mobile tariff in unison within 24 hours
 yani free kol or saste data ke din ladane vaale hai
 You will have to spend more money to talk or use internet data
 kya telecom companiyon ne cartal banaakar paise badaye gaye? yah sawaal kisi bhi upabhokta ke man main aa saktaa he
 Because the entry of Reliance Jio was done with the help of marketing capon like the cheapest and free service in the market
 reliance jeeyo ke upar to supreme court ke us faisle kaa bhi asar nahin padaa jisane vodaphone idia ke astitv par hi sankat laa diya
 Perhaps with the help of Airtel and Idea, Reliance Jio washed hands in the flowing Ganges
 jeeyo ke alaava donon badi companiyaan agiaar kii maar padane ke baad karaah rahi hai
 They had no other way than to collect money from consumers
 companiyon ko jinda rakhana he to upabhoktaaon kii jeb se paisa hi nikaalnaa hoga kyonki 10804
 Vodafone Idea, which has earned a revenue of Rs 50 crore, has suffered a loss of Rs 49727 crore
 der saver sarkaar kii in companiyon ko raahat degi or ubaarane kii koshish karegi
 But the thing to note in the midst of this whole story is that the companies that are trying to support them are actually on the shoulder of Digital India
 smart cities, internet of things kaa to abhi keval naam hi suna he inkaa aagaman inhen companiyon ke kandhe par baithkar hona he
 If companies are fighting for their survival, then where will they bring in new investments to adopt new technology? The road to 5G is difficult
 digital kranti ke sapane dekh rahe bhartiya to abhi kol drop na ho or internet tej chale isi jugat main lage hai or companiyaan badal badal par prayog kar rahe hai
 Bharti Airtel 23 in September

 8 Lakhs while 69 to Reliance Jio
 8 lakh nae graahak mili
 Consumer data is pointing to a monopoly in the market, where only one or two companies will rule
 mobile sevaayen mahangi huin to nishchit taur par khapat bhi sikudegi

 Before the Lok Sabha elections, all the big leaders have started holding public meetings and in this regard, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is ahead of the rest of the leaders and is holding a quick election rally
 pradhanmantri narendra modi congress ke pradesh adhyaksh or rajasthan ke upmukhyamantri sachin payalat ke vidhansabha kshetra se vijay sankalp raily kar bijepi ke liye rajya main loksabhaa chunaav kaa shriganesh kiya or pulavama aatanki hamale main shahid javaanon ko shradhanjali di
 It is possible if Modi is there, we have decided to create Kamdhenu Commission to protect the cow
 jiske liye bajet se 500 karod rupee kii vyavastha kii gai he
 Such big work can be possible only when you work with service
 pichley saadhe chaar saal main aise anek kaam thea, jinke bare main sirf charchaa hoti thi
 Now that it has come to the ground, a belief has arisen that Modi is possible
 rajasthan ke faujee bhaiyon ko yaad hoga ki kaise 40 saal tak unhen van rank, van pension par jhuthe vaade kiye gaye
 Today, such a thing does not suit the mouth of those who shed tears on the martyrdom of the soldiers
 hamaari sarkaar ne van rank, van pension lagu kiya 20 lakh purv phogiyon ko lagbhag 11,000 karod rupee ke arier bhi de die
 This work is done because if Modi is there, it is possible
 chunaav main congresspar chadh jaataa haverjamaafee kaa bukharpradhanmantri narendra modi ne kaha ki hamaari sarkaar pradhanmantri kisaan sammaan nidhi naam se ek aitihaasik yojana lekar ai he
 This is not the plan that the Congress brings every ten years
 congress ko chunaav aate hi karjamaafee kaa bukhaar aata he
 His scheme benefited only 20 percent of the farmers
 lekin hamaari yojana kaa laabh 90 fisadi kisaanon ko laabh milegaa, jo har saal milegaa
 7 in ten years from what we planned
 5 lakh karod rupaya sidhe kisaanon ke khate main jamaa hone vaala he
 The opposition is speaking the language of Pakistan, every Indian has stood up to help the families of the martyrs of Pulwama attack
 lekin mutthi bhar logon par afsos hota he jo bharat main rahete hue pakistan kii bhashaa bol rahe hai
 These are the same people who go to Pakistan and say do anything but remove Modi
 ye vahi log hai jo mumbai hamale ke baad aatankwaad ko jawaab nahin de paae
 Such people do not belong to the jawan of the country nor the farmer of the country
 in logon ne kaha tha ki 10 din ke andar rajasthan ke kisaanon kaa karj maaf karenge
 But was the loan waiver as promised? imran khan ke shabdon ko kasuti par kasne kii jaruratatankwaad se muqabla karnaa he to koi galati na karen
 Kashmiri is also fighting terrorism
 pakistan main nai sarkaar bani to maine nae pradhanmantri ko badhai di, maine unase kaha tha ki aap raajnneeti main aae ho aao bharat-pakistan mil kar garibi, ashiksha ke khilaaf laden
 They had told me that i am a Pathan's child, he speaks truthfully, he is honest
 aaj pakistan ke piem ke shabdon ko kasuti par kasne kii jarurat he
 Fight for Kashmir, not Kashmiris - PM Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on the news of the attack on Kashmiris in other parts of the country that what happened in any corner of India with Kashmiri children, what did not happen, is not the issue
 is desh main aisa hona nahin chahie
 Kashmir's children are suffering from terrorism
 vah aatankwaad ko khatm karne ke liye hamaare saath aane ke liye taiyaar he, hamen usko saath rakhana he
 The person who takes care of thousands of devotees in Amarnath Yatra is a child of Kashmir
 amarnath main logon ko goliyaan lagi tab kashmir ke noujvaan unke liye khadey hue unhen apana khun diya
 The way people from other parts of the country are martyred, similarly the people of Kashmir are also martyred while fighting terrorism
 chand log agar aisa karte hai to wo bharat tere tukade kaa naaraa lagane waalon ko aashirvad dene waalon ko majboot karte hai
 The Prime Minister said that after the Pulwama attack, you have seen how Pakistan is being accounted for one by one
 hamaari sarkaar ke faisle se vahaan hadakamp machaa he
 Strict action is being taken against those who promote separatism in the country and will continue to happen
 unhone kaha ki yah nai niti or nai reeti vaala bharat he
 i want to urge the angry people of the country
 sena ko hamane puri tarah khuli chhot de di he
 These days there is a flood of heroic juice on social media, but our fight is against terrorism, against the enemies of humanity, our fight is for Kashmir and not against Kashmiris
 raajnneeti se upar, rashtraniti kaa sawalpiem modi ne kaha ki aapkaa ek pradhansevak in aatankiyon kaa dana pani band karne main juta he
 Peace will not prevail in the world as long as the factory of terror continues
 agar aatank kii factory par taala lagane kaa jimmaa mere hi haq main he to yahi sahi
 This resolution is not only mine but 130 crore Indians
 yah raajnneeti se upar rashtraniti kaa sawaal he
 PM Narendra Modi said that i would pay respects to the brave soldiers of Pulwama from the land of Tonk and Sawaimadhopur
 main in vir sapooton ko janm dene vaali mataaon ko phir se apni samvednaa vyakt karata hum
 You all have made a big sacrifice for the defense of the nation
 aapaki vajah se hi bharat aaj seenaa tanakar vishwa patal par khadaa he
 The whole country is with you, today the whole world is with you
 mujhe vir javaanon par garv he jinhone hamale ke bade gunahagaar ko hamale ke 100 ghante ke baad hi vahaan pahunchaa diya jahaan unki jagah thi
 But you have faith, this time everyone will be accounted and the account will be completed
 pichley saal ke ant main hue vidhansabha chunaav main is ilaake main 8 vidhansabha seat main se 7 par bijepi ko haar mili thi
 Prime Minister Modi is going to give a message by starting a rally in Sachin Pilot's stronghold that his party will try its best to repeat the previous result of the Lok Sabha elections
 pichhali baar loksabhaa chunaav main rajasthan main 25 kii 25 siten bijepi ne jiti thi
 This time the Congress government is formed in Rajasthan, the ruling Congress is trying to get as many seats as possible
 haalanki modi kii lokapriyata ke saamne badi chunauti yah he ki rajasthan main jisaki sarkaar banati he usee kii party ko loksabhaa chunaav main zyada siten milti he
 But the BJP is determined to break this myth
 26 ko churu main pradhanmantri kii ralitonk main raily ke baad pradhanmantri narendra modi 26 farvari ko churu main bhi chunavi raily karenge or 28 farvari ko party ke kaaryakartaaon ke saath online baat karenge
 BJP has put its full strength to mobilize the public meeting
 party ke kareeb sabhi saansadon ke saath-saath pradesh prabharee prakaash jaavdekar or sah prabharee sudhanshu trivedi tonk main deraa daale hue hai
 It is believed that Narendra Modi can make big announcements for Rajasthan and Tonk, starting the campaign
 logon ko ummid he ki tonk ko rail yatayaat se jodne kii ghoshnaa kii ja sakati he or phir kalisindi or parvati ke pani ko banaas gambhiri or parvati basin main pahunchane kaa jo prastaav centre ke paas lambit he uski bhi ghoshnaa kii ja sakati he
 For the second time, Narendra Modi is coming here for the Lok Sabha election campaign in Tonk
 isse pehle modi gujarat ke siem rahane ke dauraan 2008 main chunaav prachaar ke liye tonk aa chuke hai
 The Tonk Lok Sabha seat is dominated by Gurjars and Meena
 tonk, savai madhopur, malpura jaise shahari ilaakon main muslim matadaataaon kii sankhya bhi acchhee khaasi he
 While Gurjars joined the Congress because of Pilot in the last election, their traditional voter Meena has also returned to the Congress
 aise main mana ja rahaa he ki tonk main sabha karke ajmer, bhilwara, kota, jaipur gramin, dhaulpur, karauli or jhalawad jaise siton par modi magic ko bhunaane kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 In addition to making yoga a compulsory subject from sixth to 10th standard in schools run by the central government, it will be made part of the teacher training program
 maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantri smriti irani ne somvaar ko kaha ki iske alaava agle saal yoga par ek rashtriya str kii pratiyogita kaa aayojan hoga, jisamen sarvshereshth chaatr ko paanch lakh rupee kaa nagad inaam diya jayega
 Releasing the course material for the students, Smriti said that there will be no extra burden on the students of the subject, as 80 per cent marks will be for the practical examinations
 antarrashtriya yoga diwas samaaroh ke ek din baad mantri ne kaha, main chaatro se aashwaasan chaahati hum ki ve ise praayogic str par puure samarpan ke saath karenge
 Later in a conversation with reporters, Smriti said that the states are free to decide the course
 tippaniyan Officials say that CBSE has not yet formulated a strategy to implement it in its accredited schools
 yah kaarykram kendriya vidyalayon or jawahar navoday vidyalayon main anivaary hoga
 Talking about the training module on Yoga for Teachers' Education Program, Smriti said that the aim is to create an army of teachers, so that the demands of the coming time can be met
 smriti ne yah bhi suchit kiya ki 17 july ko ek mobile ap shuru hoga, jahaan pehali se lekar 12veen kaksha tak kii ensiiarti kii kitaaben muft downlod kii ja sakengi
 Human Resource Development Minister Smriti Irani said on Monday that in addition to this, a national level competition on Yoga will be organized next year, in which the best student will be given a cash prize of Rs five lakh

 chote parde kaa yah sho jitivi ke sabase charchit dharawahikon main se he
 Recently, explosive batsman Virender Sehwag, who retired from cricket, admitted that he was hurt by being fired in the middle of the 2013 Test series against Australia
 sahvaag ne kaha ki team prabandhan yaa chayankartaaon kii taraf se bina kisi jaankaree ke baahar kiye jane se vah aahat hue the
 Sehwag was dropped after the second Test match played against Australia in Hyderabad but the Nawab of Najafgarh said that the selectors should have given him a chance to retire in Indian dress by giving him the chance to play two more Tests
 khelte hue letaa ritairementshvaag ne iespien crickinfo se kaha, maine australia ke khilaaf do test maichon main ran nahin banaaye the isliye main soch rahaa tha ki mujhe aakhri do test maichon main acha pradarshan karne ke liye abhi maukey milenge or yadi main acha pradarshan nahin karata hum to mujhe baahar kar diya jayega
 If the selectors had given me this opportunity to play two Test matches and said that you play in these two Tests and then retire, i would definitely consider it
 sahvaag se poocha gaya ki kya bisisiai or team prabandhan kii taraf se samvadaheenata rahi, to unhone is par sahmati jataai
 He said, definitely
 team prabandhan,chayankarta yaa bisisiimen se kisi ne bhi mujhe nahin bataaya
 i got information about this from newspapers
 isse main aahat hua lekin ab mujhe koi pareshaani nahin he
 Wanted to play in middle order Sehwag batted in middle order in his last three seasons in first-class cricket
 vah bhartiya team main bhi aisa chaahate the lekin unki nahin suni gai
 He said, 'I talked to the team management about this (playing in the middle order) but they believed that i can still do well as an opener and they didn't want to take any risk with the opening pair
 maine apni taraf se kaaphi prayaas kiye lekin mujhe madhyakram main mauka nahin mil sakaa
 'sehwag said,' Tendulkar was in the team when i played my last series
 kohli or dhoniteam main the
 Pujara was playing at number three
 tendulkar chauthe or kohli paanchaven number par khel rahe the
 This meant that i would have to play after Tendulkar at number six because you could not ask Tendulkar to play at number three or fifth
 isliye mere paas madhyakram main khilne kaa koi mauka nahin tha
 However, Sehwag admitted that after this he did not perform well for Delhi in the domestic session, which ended his chances of a comeback
 unhone kaha, 'jab mujhe baahar kiya gaya to mujhe lag rahaa tha ki main acha khilaadi hum or bhartiya team main vaapasi kar saktaa hum lekin main tab bhi is maansikta main ji rahaa tha ki main ek aakraamak salaami ballebaaj hum jo ran bana saktaa he lekin main yah nahin samaj paaya ki gharelu cricket antarrashtriya cricket se puri tarah bhinn he or main tab bhi usee tarah se khel rahaa tha
 'sehwag said,' i did not score in that season (2013-14) and my highest score was 56 runs
 main dilli kii paristhitiyon se talmail bithaane ke liye jujh rahaa tha
 The next year i changed my thinking and batting style and gave myself some time and scored close to 500 runs but i needed a big score last season and maybe i would have returned to the team

 The reason for the removal of this film is that, the film was shown at 11:30 am and the people of the theater requested Yash Raj Films to put its timings before the scheduled time ie 9 am, So that the right shows can be given to the rest of the films released every week
 iske alaava yah bhi bataaya gaya ki'ddlj'ke sirf ek sho kii vajah se bahut saare logon ko atirikt kaam karnaa padataa tha

 H
 loya ke maut ko supreme court ne apane faisle main swaabhaavik qaraar dekar isse jude vivaadon ko to viraam de diya lekin raajnneetik partiyon ke bich ek nai rassakashi jarur shuru ho gai
 Actually, this matter is related to BJP President Amit Shah, so both the opposition and the ruling party are interested in it
 is cese ke faisle kaa nyaayik mahatv bahut kam lekin raajnneetik mahatv bahut zyada he kyonki daanv oonche hai
 The Congress wanted a decision to implicate Amit Shah in this case so that it could make it an issue in the upcoming elections and the Bharatiya Janata Party did not want to let this happen
 pradhan nyaayadhish kii adhyakshata vaali teen jajon kii peeth ne jo faisla sunaaya vah congress ko nahin bhaayaa
 And party leader Kapil Sibal announced on April 20 that a motion for impeachment would be brought against the Chief Justice
 isamen congress ke alaava vipakshi dalon ke 71 saansadon ne hastakshar bhi kar die hai
 The notice of impeachment has reached the Vice President
 lekin sabase bada sawaal ye he ki ye mahabhiyog prastaav kis makasad ke liye laayaa ja rahaa he
 For this, it is necessary to keep an eye on the past developments
 janvari ke maheene main supreme court ke chaar jajon ne asaadhaaran taur par press conference karte hue chif justise par mukademon kii bench ke alotment main manamaani kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 In that press conference, Justice J
 chelmeshwar bhi shaamil the jo ki duusare sabase varisht jaj hai
 One of the cases in which the Chief Justice was charged was also believed to have been the case of Justice Loya, who was not referred to the court of any of the four judges who held the press conference
 sanyog tha ki 12 janvari ko supreme court ke kuch jajon ne bharat ke mukhya nyaayadhish par aarope lagaate hue press conference kii thi or iske thik ek din baad airsel mexis maamle ke silsile main purv vittamantri pi
 Chidambaram's son Karti Chidambaram's hideouts were raided by the Enforcement Directorate and he was also arrested in later days
 press conferes ke baad se hi chif justise ke khilaaf mahabhiyog kaa prastaav laae jane kii charchaa congress ke netritv vaale vipaksh ke hawaale se saamne aane lagi thim
 Just for information that Justice Deepak Mishra was appointed to the Supreme Court in 2011, the Congress was in government
 ye bhi ki mahabhiyog ke prastaav par congress ke netaa or diggaj vakil salmaan khurshid apni asahmati jataa chuke hai
 The motion for impeachment is brought in Parliament for the removal of judges of the Supreme Court and High Court when there are allegations of misconduct against them
 raajnneetik dalon ke paas ye ek hathiyaar kii tarah hota he, jiskaa ve apane hisaab se istemaal kar sakate hai
 The other aspect of this is that the greatest thing about a judge is his reputation and the pressure is on the judge not to stain
 mahabhiyog kaa prastaav faisle ko paksh main karne ke liye agar hoga to loktantr ke liye usase bada koi kalank nahin ho saktaa
 Unfortunately, if the ruling party ever did so and reversed the decision, democracy would die
 justise deepak mishra ke maamle main congress va anya vipakshi dalon ne is hathiyaar kaa istemaal kar liya he ab anjaam ke liye sansad ke satr tak kaa intjaar karnaa hoga
 But the opposition has raised the finger on the Chief Justice's reputation
 nyaaypalika or vyavasthapika ke bich takaraav kaa ye ekadam doosraa pahalu he
 Earlier the government was in front of the judiciary when the Judicial Accountability Act was rejected by the Supreme Court
 sochie agar uske baad sarkaar aisa karti to kisi vikat sthiti hoti
 The opposition has used constitutional provision to take it under pressure instead of putting its point in court
 isse galat chalan shuru hua he

 The G-spot is a product of women's imagination

 The G-spot is a pea-sized structure in the first layer of the vagina
 ji-spot samvedansheel kshetra he jo sukh dene vaale bade kshetra kaa hissaa he
 Is there such a thing as a G-spot? Specialist of Sexual Medicine at Apollo Hospital, Chennai and US College of Sexologists, Dr
 narayan reddy kehete hai, ''yah bilkul vaisaa hi sawaal he ki kya ishwar kaa astitv hota he
 "the G-spot is believed to be a sponge-like pea-shaped area that lies two or three inches inside the vaginal wall and can be identified by touching
 ise sabase zyada kamottejak kshetra mana jaataa he, jo baar-baar uttejit karne par kamechha ko jaagrit kar detaa he or aisa karne se kuch striyaan charamsukh paati hai to kuch skhlit ho jaati hai
 But it still remains a puzzle for some people
 ''aadhunik vigyaan ke vibhinn chamatkaaron ke baavjood aaj bhi ek sidhaa sawaal bana hua he—kya ji-spot sachmuch hota he, or ab tak iskaa koi uttar nahin mila he
 "there are many questions about it — where does it happen, and what does it do? On this question there is an uproar among its supporters and opponents
 1905 main manovigyaani sigmand frid ne bataaya tha ki sahavaas main charam sukh kii do tarah kii avasthaa hoti he, jisamen yoni kaa charam sukh ''vaastavik charam sukh" he
 This theory got its biological basis when in 1950, Germany's gynecologist and inventor of the intrauterine device (IUD), Dr
 arnest gracenberg ne yoni ke saamne vaali diwaar par ''vishesh kamoddeepak hissaa" hone kii jaankaree di
 They were ignored and even made fun of

 The recognition was forgotten for decades but gained prominence in 1982, when it gained legitimacy in a book called The g-spot and Other Discoveries About Human Sexuality
 yah pustak antarrashtriya rup se behad prasiddh ho gai or sabase zyada bikne vaali kitabon main shaamil ho gai
 Researchers John Perry, Beverly Whipple and Alice Kahn reported aberrations after abrasion in over 400 women
 phir bhi shodhakartaaon ne is par andeh jataayaa or ise ''streesmbandhi aadhunik mithy" qaraar diya
 The G-spot became a topic of discussion again in 2008, when researchers at Laquilla University, Italy, used ultrasound to find out its location
 unhone kaha, lekin usamen ek baat he, kuch auraton main lagata he ji-spot he, vahiin kuch auraton main nahin he
 This dilemma continued in this subject until 2014, until a new research found that the G-spot was actually just a part of a larger area of sexual pleasure in women

 " dawaaon kii suraksha ke liye epad kii manjuuri kii prakriya ko duniya bhar main sabase uttam standard mana jaataa he, or isane ji-spot badhaane ke liye kisi bhi philler ko manjuuri nahin di he or na hi yoni kii deevaaron main injection kii manjuuri di he
 Collagen, hyaluronic acid, radice, and PRP are all approved to heal chronic wounds, not as skin fillers
 lekin epad medical practice kaa niyaman nahin karata he, na hi ji-shot ke bare main ab tak ise koi shikaayat mili he
 According to doctors who brought this treatment to India, most people consider it a very low-risk treatment that does not require any study or medical examination
 magu ke zyaadaatar marij nishaan pad jane, anubhuti main kami or cancer ke khatre ko lekar chintaa jaahir karte hai
 "most of these concerns are unfounded," she says
 " is kaam main itane saal lagane ke baad ve jamini reporton yani marij ke bayanon par bharosa karti hai
 She says, "I have not yet found a single woman who is not happy with this treatment
" " tulla kaa kahana he ki yah to mahilaon ke anand kii ''abhi shuruyaat he
 "he guesses, it all seems a bit strange right now, but soon the G-shot will become a normal thing
 agar sex apane samay kii ek kriya he to desh kii mahilaon ke sex jivan ke bare main yah kya kahata he? iske mul main jaaen to yah kuch behad kamjor tareeke se paribhaashit koshikaon ke bare main he, jo mahilaon ke liye khushiyaan laa bhi saktaa he or nahin bhi laa saktaa he
 Or is it about the power of women
 chamchamaate gharon ke saath oonche kariyar, badi jimmedaariyon ke saath paison ke peeche bhaagate hue kya ve us ek kshetra main zyada se zyada purush jaisaa banane kii koshish kar rahi hai, jahaan jeevigyaan ek niyati he
 Can a woman now be able to awaken and stop her sexuality like a man and by injecting it can increase the G-spot in the same way that a man shows his strength on the strength of Viagra? Despite all the debates, the doctor agrees on one thing: who is the ideal patient for a G-shot? The one who is already having more fun in bed

 The Bharatiya Janata Party has suffered a major setback in Madhya Pradesh
 aaj vidhansabha main bill par hui voting main do bijepi vidhayakon ne kamalnath sarkaar kaa samarthan kar diya
 After this, both the mlas indicated to join Congress
 ab ye saaf bhi ho gaya he ki donon vidhayak congress kaa haath pakadaney vaale hai
 When BJP rebel MLA Narayan Tripathi was asked about leaving the party, he said that after the experience of the Bharatiya Janata Party, i have decided to join Congress
 main 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main apni marji se bijepi main nahin gaya tha, mujhe jabardastee bhartiya janata party main le jaaya gaya tha
 i did not even have any condition to join BJP
 maine sirf vikaas kaa mudda uthaaya tha, lekin bhartiya janata party vah party he jahaan anya dal kaa koi bhi netaa yaa koi bhi aadmi jaataa he to bade achche se bulaayaa jaataa he
 At the same time, when he goes back, there is no way of doing politics
 narayan treepathi ne aage kaha, bijepi main anya dal ke aae hue aadmi kaa maan-sammaan khatm kar diya jaataa he
 Shivraj ji is like my elder brother
 chunaav main ek-ek gaanv par ghoshnaa to kar daali, lekin ghoshnaa ke baad ek kaam nahin hua
 i do not do caste politics, home family politics, business politics
 main raajnneeti karata hum keval vikaas kii
 Maihar did not grow and did not get any respect, so i felt that there is no need to live in this house
 desh kii paristhitiyon se main bahut dukhi tha jiske kaaran aaj main bhartiya janata party se alag hokar congress main aa gaya
 When Narayan Tripathi was asked about quitting BJP, he said, i am not in the Bharatiya Janata Party
 main khuleam ye baat kar rahaa hum
 i am sitting in Congress, i am sitting with Bhai Sahab (suresh Pachauri)
 duusare baagi bijepi vidhayak sharad kaul ne kaha, main bhi 10 saal congress parivaar main rahe or hamane puri janabhaawanaaon se kshetra main kaam kiya
 Public interest was fought and with the same expectations, the public gave us a chance and we have come here on behalf of the Bharatiya Janata Party
 janata ne hamen mauka diya he or ham 5 saal main vikaas nahin kar sakate to hamaara yahaan rahane kaa koi matlab nahin he
 We are confident and under the leadership of Kamal Nath, we will be the pioneers in the development of our region and will be able to develop our region under his leadership
 hamane bijepi se puri tarah se istipha dene kaa man bana liya he

 pakistan ke raashtrapati asif ali jaradaari ne kaha he ki desh kii raajnneetik shaktiyaan taqatvar khufia agency ‘iesai’ par asainya niyantran chaahati hai, lekin is masale ko thande baste main daal diya gaya he
 "political powers want civilian control over ISI, but the issue has been put on hold," Zardari said in an interview to a news channel
 ’’ haalanki, unhone is masale ko thande baste main rakhe jane kii vajah nahin bataai
 In fact, Zardari's Pakistan People's Party (PPP) -led government tried to bring the ISI under the control of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in July last year, but the decision was reversed after opposition from the country's powerful army
 pakistani raashtrapati ne yah bhi bataaya ki unhone haal hi main karachi main shiya logon ke ek juluus par hue hamale ke liye aatankwaadi sanghathanon ko jimmedaar tehraaya tha, jiskaa zikr unhone pichley maheene purv pradhanmantri benazir bhutto kii duusari punyatithi par bhi kiya tha
 43 people were killed in this attack
 jaradaari ne kaha ki unke is bhaashan kaa jawaab aatankwaadiyon ne hamale ke jariye diya
 The Pakistani president also said that some political elements are conspiring against the government, but they have 'political weapons', which will thwart such schemes at the right time
 jaradaari ne beete 27 disambar ko benazir kii duusari punyatithi ke maukey par aarope lagaaya tha ki ‘sarkaar se itar tatv’ pakistan ko todane kaa shadyantr rach rahe hai
 He did not reveal the identity of these elements, but there was a lot of speculation in the political corridors about whose direction he was pointing
 unhone bataaya ki afghanistan kii seemaa se lage desh ke kabyli kshetra main sainya abhiyaan ke bare main sena or sarkaar ke bich purna saamanjasy he
 Zardari also said that the views of the military establishment have always been heard and noticed
 yah puche jane par ki kya unki jaan ko koi khatra he, pakistani raashtrapati ne kaha, ‘‘beete samay main desh ke kai pramukhon kaa katl hua he or is tarah ke kisi khatre kii baat ko khaarij nahin kiya ja saktaa, desh kaa pramukh hone ke naate mujhe suraksha or protocol praapt he
 When asked about his declining popularity with Zardari, he said, "I know that my popularity graph is falling down, but if we do not take any hard decision at this time, our future generations will never see us
" Will not forgive ’’ unhone yah bhi kaha ki pipipi kaa maananaa he ki taharik e taliban ke maare ja chuke pramukh batulla mahsood unki patni evam purv pradhanmantri benazir bhutto kii hatya kaa shadyantr rachane ke liye jimmedaar tha

 congress ne kiya he AFSPA kii samiksha kaa vaadacongress ne ghoshnaa patr main vaada kiya he ki satta main aane par suraksha balon ke adhikaron or nagarikon ke maanavadhikaron main AFSPA kanoon ke tahat santulan banane ke liye sanshodhan karegi or jabaran laapata karne, yon hinsa or yatnaa main mili chhot (immunity) ko hataa liya jayega
 The BJP is trying to surround the Congress with this promise
 kendriya mantri arun jetali se lekar bijepi adhyaksh amit shah tak maidan main utar aae or kaha ki congress party khatarnaak vaade kar rahi he
 Shah said that the Congress manifesto has an agenda which is going to break the country
 AFSPA ke mudde ko bijepi hawa dene main jute gai he
 The congress-bjp has two hands on the treason, promising that if it comes to power, it will abolish Section 124A of the Indian Penal Code defining treason, as it is being misused and later enacted new laws
 It also lost its importance after leaving
 aise main is kanoon kaa ab koi matlab nahin he
 Congress said that civil liberties are the hallmark of our democratic republic
 kanoonon kaa uddeshy swatatranta ko majbootee dena hota he
 Laws should only be to reflect our values
 'bijepi ne kaha ki ghoshnaa patr main congress kah rahi he ki ipisi se section 124-A hataa diya jayega, deshadroh karnaa ab aparaadh nahin he
 The party that makes such a declaration is not entitled to a single vote
 in kanoonon ko badalane kaa saahas jawahar laal nehru, indira gandhi, rajeev gandhi, manmohan singh jaise netaaon ne bhi nahin kiya tha
 He alleged that Rahul Gandhi in his mind is making promises which cannot be implemented and there are some very dangerous ideas and the country is not ready to accept them
 kashmir par congress kii narmi par bijepi aakraamakacongress ne apane ghoshnaa patr main jammu-kashmir par naram rukh akhriyaar kiya he
 The Congress has promised that if it comes to power, it will reduce the presence of the army from the valley and give responsibility to the state police
 iske alaava soobe ke sabhi logon se bina shart baat karenge
 BJP leader Arun Jaitley said that the country cannot forgive the historic mistake of nehru-gandhi family in Jammu and Kashmir, Rahul Gandhi is advancing that agenda
 iskaa matlab saaf he ki congress ke kashmir par narmi ko lekar bijepi chunavi mudda banane jute gai he
 Those who have been called Hindu terrorists have woken up: After the court's decision on the modi-samjhauta blast, the BJP has begun to surround the Congress
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne maharashtra ke wardha kii raily main hindu aatankwaad kii shabdaawalee ko lekar congress par nishaanaa saadhaa tha
 Modi had accused the opposition parties of insulting peace-loving followers of religion by linking them to terrorism
 unhone kaha ki hindu ab jaag chukaa he or vipakshi dalon ko dandit karne kaa nirnay liya he
 Modi said that he (congress) whom he described as a terrorist has now woken up
 congress ne hindu aatankwaad shabd kaa prayog kar desh ke karodon logon ko kalankit karne kaa prayaas kiya
 You tell me, didn't you feel sad when you heard the word Hindu terrorism
 hajaaron saal ke itihaas main kya ek bhi udhaaharan he jahaan hindu aatankwaad main shaamil rahe hon
 Modi questioned the people whether he would forgive the Congress for committing the sin of linking peace-loving Hindus with terrorism

 This film Friday has released the untold story of a star struggling with struggles, 'budhia Singh - Born to Run', directed by Soumendra Padhi and starring Manoj Bajpayee, Mayur Patole, Tilottama Shome, and Shruti Marathe in pivotal roles in the film
 
 
 yah film vander boy budhiya kii kahani par aadhaarit he, jisane 5 saal kii umr main 48 marathon daudane kaa kirtiman hasil kiya
 Behind Budhia's success was the hand of his coach Biranchi Das, Manoj Bajpayee, who recognized Budhia's skills and inspired him to become a marathon runner, after which Budhia's name was included in the Limca Book of Records as the Youngest Marathon Runner
 Gone
 yahi he kahani is film kii
 The comments ab baat film kii kuubiyon or kaamiyon kii, jinamein sabase pehle baat karte hai kaamiyon kii
 
 
 The screen play of the film looks a bit staggered, which makes the film slow at times, though it was a difficult task to bring the subject to the screen as much of the story in the film is based on Budhia's race and Biranchi's struggle in which every race is interesting It was a difficult task to make
 kahin-kahin ye daud filmakan ke taur par dhili padati he or vah bhi interval se pehle, iske alaava mujhe lagata he lekhak or nirdeshak agar film kaa climex pakadakar falesh back main gaye hote to film zyada kasi hui sabit hoti
 These were the shortcomings of the film, but the film is dominated by the flaws, so now the thing is, the theme of the film and its story itself is very impressive
 
 
 yah kahani he vishwaas, junun, bhukh or kuch kar guzarane kii chaah kii, jisamen bholepan kaa mishran bhi he
 Manoj Bajpayee is a well-known artist and i liked his performance even better in this film as well as in the role of Budhia, Mayur goes home in your heart, he has done a wonderful job
 film main mayur or manoj ke bich kaa talmail bhi gazab kaa he
 The best thing that i felt was that when you see Budhia running in the film, your love for him will also spill away and you will also feel compassion but you do not hate Manoj in the role of the coach and for this director Soumendra gets full marks
 film main budhiya kii kahani or biranchi kaa sangharsh aapako thame rakhata he
 The rest of the film's characters are also effective
 film kaa becoground score, cinemetographi sab sur main he jisaki vajah se jo nirdeshak kahana chahta he vah thik usee tarah se aap tak pahunchataa he jaisi uski manshaa thi
 So overall 'budhia Singh - Born to Run' is a great film, let me also tell that this film has also received the National Award for 'best Children's Film' this year
 meri taraf se bhi is film ko 4 stars
 The film is based on the story of Wonder Boy Budhia, who at the age of 5 achieved the record of running 48 marathons
 budhiya kii is kamyaabi ke peeche haath tha uske coach biranchi das yani manoj bajpeyi kaa jisane budhiya ke hunar ko pahachaanaa or use prerit kiya marathon dhaavak banane ke liye, jiske baad budhiya kaa naam yanguest marathon ranor ke taur par limca book of records main shaamil kiya gaya
 This is the story of this film
 tippaniyan Now talk about the film's strengths and shortcomings, the first of which talks about the shortcomings
 
 
 film kaa screen play thodaa dagamagaaya dikhataa he, jisaki vajah se film kahin-kahin dhimi padati he, haalanki is vishay ko parade par utaarna mushkil kaam tha kyonki film main zyaadaatar kahani budhiya kii daud or biranchi ke sangharsh par aadhaarit he jisamen har daud ko rochak bananaa mushkil kaam tha
 Sometimes this race is slow in the form of filming and that too before the interval, besides i think if the writer and director had captured the climax of the film and went to the flash back, the film would have proved more tight
 ye thim film kii khamiyaan par is film main kaamiyon par kuubiyaan haaavee hai isliye ab baat kuubiyaan kii, film kaa vishay or isaki kahani apane aap main bahut prabhaavshaalee he
 
 
 This is a story of faith, passion, hunger and desire to do something, which also has a mixture of naivete
 manoj bajpeyi ek manze hue kalakaar hai or unka abhinay is film main mujhe or bhi behatar laga saath hi budhiya ke kirdaar main mayur aapke dil main ghar kar jate hai, kamaal kaa kaam kiya he mayur ne
 The synergy between Mayur and Manoj in the film is also amazing
 sabase acchhee baat jo mujhe lagi vah yah ki film main budhiya ko bhaagate dekh uske prati aapkaa prem bhi chhalkegaa or taras bhi aayega par coach ke kirdaar main manoj se aapako ghrinaa bhi nahin hoti or iske liye nirdeshak saumenndra ko ful marks milte hai
 In the film, the story of Budhia and the struggle of Birnchi holds you back
 film ke baaqi kirdaar bhi asardaar hai
 The background score of the film is in cinematography, which is why the director wants to say that he reaches you exactly as he intended
 to kul milakar 'budhiya singh- bourn tu ran' ek behtareen film he, ye bhi bataa duun ki is film ko is saal 'best childrens film' kaa neshnal award bhi mil chukaa he
 4 stars from my side too
 ab baat film kii kuubiyon or kaamiyon kii, jinamein sabase pehle baat karte hai kaamiyon kii

 com / ukqphjwt5y— Saj Sadiq (@saj_pakpassion)june 17, 2019bataa den ki world cap main pakistan ke kharaab pradarshan ko lekar pakistan ke kai purv diggaj khilaadiyon ne team management or team chayan par sawaal khadey kiye hai
 At the same time, he has expressed his displeasure at ignoring the basic requirements for preparing players in Pakistan
 aise main kaha ja saktaa he ki under 19 ke tej gendbaaj mohammad imran bhi isi andekhi kaa shikaar hue hai
 Explain that the action of Mohammad Imran's bowling matches with that of Pakistan's dangerous fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar
 yahi nahin unki kad-lathi or raftaar bhi akhtar se milti julati he
 It is said that the batsman standing in front of him was always in trouble
 soshal media par share kiye ja rahe video main yah saaf taur par dekha ja saktaa he
 Mohammad Imran, 22, has finished second in the Ufone King of Speed competition on his own bowling
 yahi nahin, wo karachi kii under 19 team se bhi khel chuke hai
 Despite this, he was not noticed by the Pakistan Cricket Board
 haalanki, unki haalia aarthik halaat aise hai ki unhen mazdooree kar pet paalna pad rahaa he
 The last phase of election campaigning ended
 ab aapako eggzet pole jhelane ke liye taiyaari kerani hogi
 Major claims will be made regarding the number of seats which will be valid from the evening of May 19 till the results on May 23, after which they will expire
 vaise whatsap group main eggzet pole to kab se chal rahaa he
 Especially for journalists who, according to their own, reduce four seats in a state, they increase it by forty seats
 kai log kinare le jaakar poochhate hai ki akele main bataa do kiski sarkaar banegi, sahi baat he ki hamen nahin maaloom he
 One particular thing of this election was that the particularity of the interview was over
 jo netaa apane intervyuu main jawaab nahin de rahe the, wo duusare netaa ke intervyuu kaa mazaaq uda rahe the
 Both Prime Minister Modi and Congress President Rahul Gandhi did this work
 doharaavan tiharaavan intervyuu die gaye
 Nothing special came out of him, but every interview was called exclusive
 tent ke peeche vaala bhi exclusive tha or kamare main liting ke saath vaala intervyuu bhi exclusive tha
 Look carefully, the leaders also made the interview part of the strategy
 ek din ek hi netaa ke chaar chaar jagah par intervyuu ho rahe hai
 The spokesperson followed and the main leader was replaced by the camera
 shaayad dibet ke kaaran pravaktaaon kii ahmiyat kam ho gai isliye unki jagah bade netao ne hi morcha sambhala
 The Prime Minister's interview ranged from an hour to an hour and a half, while Rahul Gandhi's ranged from 20 minutes to 35 minutes
 intervyuu karne vaale ankaron kii khub samiksha hui ki unhone pradhanmantri or rahul gandhi se kis tarah ke sawaal puche
 Did those questions have merit or did the journalist appear to be the artist
 yah bhi darshak ke jivan kaa hissaa ho gaya he
 The viewer does not just listen to the leader's answer, he is also weighing the question of the anchor
 yah acha he
 The audience is as good as it gets
 lekin darshakon ke samajhane se intervyuu ke str par koi fark nahin padaa
 The anchors still asked questions of the same level that were being criticized
 pradhanmantri modi se puche jane vaale or rahul gandhi se puche jane vaale sawaalon ke tevar main fark darshakon ne notice kiya
 Research can be done on how much the reliability of the interview has fallen and how much has increased
 dainik bhaskar main kaveri bamazai kaa ek lekh chapa tha, jisase andaaza miltaa he ki media ke spes main kis paksh ko kitni jagah mili he
 Kaveri made this analysis based on research by the Broadcasters Audience Research Council (BARC)
 iske anusaar tivi par 1 se 28 april tak pradhanmantri modi ne 64 reliyaan kii thim
 The Congress President held 65 rallies
 is dauraan pradhanmantri modi ko 722 ghante jagah mili, congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ko 251 ghante jagah mili
 BJP president Amit Shah stood at number three, getting 123 hours
 congress mahasachiv priyanka gandhi ko 84 ghante dikhaaya gaya
 BSP President Mayawati was shown on TV for 84 hours
 isse puri tasviir nahin milti he magar andaaza hota he ki pradhanmantri modi kii raily or bijepi adhyaksh amit shah kii raily ko 845 ghante jagah mili or rahul gandhi or priyanka gandhi ko 335 ghante dikhaaya gaya
 The whole picture is not because we do not know whether it includes regional channels or not
 kaveri bamzai ne sirf 11 hindi channelon kaa vishleshan kiya he
 We do not know what has happened in the newspapers
 jo reporting hui he usamen darshak yaa pathak ko soochna dene vaale kaarykram kitne the yaa dibet ke naam par hangaamaa dikhaane vaale kaarykram kitne the
 Should also be looked at according to the donation
 elactoral band khub bika he
 You know that only Stat Bank of India is authorized to sell Electoral Bonds
 2017-18 main bijepi ko 210 karod ke electoril band mili
 Whereas during this period the total bond was sold at 221 crores
 congress ko isamen se maatr 5 karod kaa band mila
 In January and March, an electoral bond of 1716 crore has been sold
 2018 main chah maheene main maatr 1,056 karod ke hi band bike the
 Combining all the donations, the BJP received a donation of 990 crore in 2017-18
 congress ko maatr 142 karod kaa chanda mila
 There will be an imbalance in terms of media and funds, but it has always been that whoever is in power gets more funds
 zarur bijepi or congress ke bich fund or media spes kii koi tulana nahin kii ja sakati he
 There is no election with just money and media
 sanghathan, ummidavaar or ranneeti kaa bhi bada role hota he
 The media has little idea about how a party is fighting at the booth level
 kya kar rahi hoti he
 But this also changes the electoral outcome
 It is also not a concrete formula
 chunaav main haar or jeet kai kaarnon se tay hoti he
 It is definitely that the election information you get from the TV space is very incomplete
 ab chunaav ho gaya he
 There is no report of many states, and by watching TV, it is not known whether elections have been held there or not
 to in sab antaron or antarvirodhon ke bich phek news kii kya bhoomika rahi, jiske bare main chunaav se pehle kaaphi charchaa hui, kya phek news ne 2019 ke chunaav ko nirdhaarit kiya, tay kiya
 a small team of Alt News made the issue of investigating Fake News very important
 phek news kaa istamaal sampradayik dhruvikaran failaane main bhi kiya gaya
 On one occasion, on the video, he started saying that the building behind him is from Rahul Gandhi
 ye to alt news ke inspector the jinhone is tarah kaa jhooth pakad liya
 False claims were also made about Prime Minister Modi that he was abusing
 alt news ne bataaya ki ye puri tarah galat he
 Twitter deleted many fake accounts
 pradhanmantri ke ek lakh folor ko hataa diya
 Removed 9000 followers of Rahul Gandhi
 amit shah ke 16,500 folor hataa diye
 40,000 followers of Kejriwal removed
 whatsap uniwarsity par kya chal rahaa he ise lekar kam hi reporting hui
 Facebook has also removed fake pages of Congress and BJP
 to kya 2019 kaa chunaav phek news mukt chunaav hua
 The Modi government is constantly striving to promote cashless transactions
 iske liye vah aam aadmi ko kai jagahon par chhot bhi de rahi he
 Now the government can extend this exemption further
 sarkaar saamaan par lagane vaale jiesti main cashles lenden main raahat de sakati he
 This way it will be much cheaper for you to buy goods than others
 4 may kojisti parishadki baithak honi he
 In this meeting the council can give discounts on purchases to those who will make digital payments
 is baithak main cashles len dein par jiesti rate main do fisadi kii chhot di ja sakati he
 However, the maximum limit for this exemption can be Rs 100
 yah phayda bijness tu kanjumar len-dein main mil saktaa he
 According to the offer, the customer can be given two options
 isamen ek yah hoga ki ve nagad main bhugtan karen or saamaanya jiesti rate adaa karen
 Another option would be customers to do digital transactions and get a 2% discount on GST rate instead
 haalanki antim faisla kya liya jaataa he, yah 4 may ko hi pataa chalegaa
 According to officials, if this proposal gets the green signal in the GST Council, then it will increase the burden on government exchequer from 10 thousand to 25 thousand crore
 haalanki yah kharch is par nirbhar karegaa ki har saal kitne cashles len-dein hote hai
 Currently, the agenda of the GST Council meeting includes necessary amendments in the indirect tax regime rules, including simplifying filing of GST returns
 parishad kii 27veen baithak video conferencing ke jariye hogi or isamen rajyon ke vitt mantri shaamil honge
 The meeting may also consider making GSTN a government company
 isi baithak main susheel modi kii aguwai vaala mantriyon kaa samooh ritern form kaa nayaa praaroop bhi yahaan pesh karegaa
 The biggest political problem of Maharashtra's Brahmin Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis has been solved
 maharashtra rajya pichde ayog ne apni report main maraathon ko rajya main pichhadaa mana he
 This report has cleared the way for Marathas to get reservation
 pichhadaa ayog kii report main maratha samudaay ko saamaajik, aarthik or shaikshanik aadhaar par pichhadaa mana gaya he
 Sources in the commission have told the Times of India that after the report, the way has been cleared for Marathas to get reservation in educational institutions and government jobs in the state
 ayog ke sachiv is report ko guuruuvaar ko rajya ke mukhya sachiv dike jain ko saunp sakate hai
 The minister in the Maharashtra government says that this report will not be submitted to the Bombay High Court, as is being speculated in the media
 unhone kaha, 'ham is report par cabinet meeting main charchaa karenge
 We will bring a bill to provide reservation to the Marathas and get the Legislative Assembly passed the law
 agar koi is kanoon ko court main chunauti degaa to hi ham yah report court main pesh karenge
 'let us tell you that the demand for reservation of Marathas has been pending since the 1980s
 rajya pichhadaa ayog ke sutron ke mutabik 25 vibhinn maanakon par maraathon ke saamaajik, shaikshanik or aarthik aadhaar par pichhadaa hone kii jaanch kii
 Out of this, the Marathas found the situation pathetic on all parameters
 is dauraan kiye gaye survey main 43 hajaar maratha pariwaron kii sthiti jaani gai
 Apart from this, about 2 crore memorandums found in public hearings were also studied
 sutron ke mutabik report kii sabase ahm sifarish he ki maraathon ko maujuuda anya pichhadi jatiyon ke 27 fisadi cote ko badhaakar aarakshan diya ja saktaa he
 In this, the government's attention has also been drawn towards the 'nagraj case', citing that the state government can increase the quota of reservation by more than 50 per cent, which is the limit set by the Supreme Court
 ayog ke sutara kaa kahana he, 'hamane sarkaar se yah nahin kaha he ki maraathon ko kitna aarakshan diya janaa chahie
 Fixing quotas is the prerogative of the government
 ' bataa den ki maratha 16 fisadi aarakshan kii maang kar rahe the, lekin mantri kaa kahana he ki is samudaay ko 8 se 10 fisadi tak kota diya ja saktaa he
 At present, CM Fadnavis is visiting Akola, a drought-prone area
 vahaan unhone is report ke bare main puche jane par saharsha uttar diya ki sarkaar is report par do hafton main jaruri kadam uthaa legi
 Let me tell you that since the 1980s, the demand for Maratha reservation started coming up
 tab maratha karmchaariyon ke netaa annasaheb patil ne is andolan kaa netritv kiya tha
 During this hunger strike, he lost his life
 iske baad yah maamla thande baste main chalaa gaya
 The matter was once again raised in the 2009 assembly elections
 2014 tak is maang ne kaaphi jor pakad liya tha
 Then the Chief Minister of the congress-ncp government, Prithviraj Chavan, announced a 16 percent reservation for the Marathas
 haalanki, is faisle ko bombai hai court ne palat diya tha
 During this time the command of the state was taken over by Brahmin Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis
 unke kaarykaal main ahmednagar jile main maratha samudaay kii ek naaballig ladki kaa gangrape or murder ho gaya tha
 After this the community was again infuriated
 is maamle ke doshiyon ko sajaa dene kii maang ko lekar shuru hua virodh maratha samudaay ke andolan main badal gaya
 Since 2016, 58 cases have been removed across the state in this case
 yah maamla court ke saamne lambit hone se sarkaar ne pichde ayog ko maratha samudaay kii saamaajik, aarthik or shaikshanik sthiti jaanane kii jimmedaari di thi
 The trouble for the Fadnavis government was compounded when an OBC faction in the state said that Maratha community should be given separate reservation from 27 per cent quota
 iske alaava, aurangabad jile main kakasaheb scindia ne aarakshan kii maang ko lekar ek nahar main kudakar jaan de di thi
 Nine people committed suicide in the state only to demand reservation for the Maratha community
 mana ja rahaa he ki is report ke aane ke baad maharashtra ke brahman mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis ke kaarykaal kii sabase badi chunauti kaa hal nikal aayega

 For the Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, the city of Lucknow, the Nawabs, laid eyes on the road show
 subah se kaaryakartaaon kaa utsaah hilore maar rahaa tha
 a crowd of activists thronged the Congress office
 puraa shahar priyanka ke swaagat vaale postaron se pata hua tha
 But Priyanka remained silent throughout the road show
 ve haath hilaakar logon kaa abhivadan sweekaar karti raheen, lekin boleen kuch nahin
 Priyanka's silence knocks Rahul Gandhi from the beginning of the show to Congress headquarters thrice, but Priyanka's silence knocked people on all three occasions
 congress mukhyalay main ummid thi ki dinabhar kii chuppi ke baad shaam ve kuch bolengi, lekin vahaan bhi priyanka khamoshi hi akhriyaar kiye baithi raheen

 kab nikalegaa bolne kaa muhuurtarode sho khatm hone par jo sawaal rah gaya wo ye ki priyanka gandhi apni chuppi todane kaa muhoort kab nikaalengi
 Thousands of workers were left shocked to know what she spoke, how she spoke, how much she spoke
 20 din ke intjaar ke baad priyanka gandhi pehali baar upi pahunchin bhi to boleen kuch nahin
 The question about this has become even bigger because she left for Jaipur as soon as the program was over, because husband Robert Vadra is to be questioned by ED in the Bikaner land deal tomorrow

 Murthy k Uppaluri, CEO of Randstad India and Sri Lanka, said, "market sentiment is looking positive and in view of this it is estimated that employees will get better salary increase this year than last year

 Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Mulayam Singh Yadav's residence on Vikramaditya Marg in Lucknow had a very emotional view
 apane puraane dost madhukar jetali ke saath mohammad ajam khan 4 disambar kii dopaher jaise hi ambeseder car se utre, yadav ke bete akhilesh ne unka aashirwad lene ke liye unke pair chhue
 On this, Khan, who seems to be furious, took out a date box and handed him a gift to Mulayam while waiting anxiously
 iske baad donon; kuch pal ek-duusare se lipte rahe
 Indeed, Khan's return to the SP came after several rounds of informal meetings and phone conversations with Jaitley, a key strategist and Mulayam's brother Ramgopal and a trusted confidant of the Yadav family
 khan vaapasi ke liye thodaa vakt chaahate the
 He wanted to openly apologize to the country besides Mulayam Muslims for including Kalyan Singh in the party
 par ramgopal or jetali ne tasalli se bithakar unhen samajhayaa or rasta saaf ho gaya
 As Khan made up his mind, the Yadav family decided to return to the party headquarters in Lucknow on 4 December
 us din mulaayam ne sabhi party padaadhikariyon, saansadon or vidhayakon ko party masalon par baat karne ke bahaane lakhanu bulaayaa
 But everyone knew the real reason
 party daftar khachaakhach bhar gaya tha
 The land was ready for Khan's argument
 ve mulaayam ke saath ek hi car se utre or dhakka-mukki karte mediakarmiyon or party kaaryakartaaon ko peeche chhodte hue manch par ja pahunche
 Khan is known for his arguments anyway
 unhone mulaayam ko musalamaanon kaa aisa maseehaa bataaya, jisane maanavtaa kii khatir babari masjid bachaane ke liye 1990 main mukhyamantri kii apni gaddi qurbaan kar di
 When Mulayam's eyes became wet, Khan also had to remove a handkerchief
 vidhansabha main vipahn ke netaa shivpal singh yadav ne to khan kii khatir pad se istipha dene tak kii bhi peshkash kar di
 But Khan refused, saying that "people are very foolish, they will make the wrong sense
" '' shivpal ke istife ko faadte hue unhone jadgabaat main kaha, ''dal se bhale gaya tha, par dil se kabhi nahin
 He later reiterated that he is not in politics for office and money, but for serving the poor and marginalized sections of the society
 ''meraa bank balance dekh lijie
 i have nothing but old cars and some clothes
 ''par mulaayam or khan kii apane jadgabati rishton ko siyasat main dhaal lene kii asal pariksha ab shuru hogi
 First, Mulayam has to break the notion that SP is the fief of a family
 party main chunaavon ke dauraan bhi un par musalamaanon kii keemat par apane kunbe ko badhaava dene kaa aarope lagata rahaa he
 Secondly, despite the overwhelming reception of Khan, both have to prove that once they have used those selectively used slang for each other, they have now become one
 tisare, donon ko yah bhi dhyaan rakhana hoga ki unka siyaasi vikaas ram janmabhumi-babari masjid vivaad jaise atyant bhaavnaatmak mudde kii jameen par hua he
 Now that is no longer an issue
 so, musalamaanon ko party main khinchakar laane ke liye unhen nae mudde talashne honge
 In some areas of eastern Uttar Pradesh, the rise of the Muslim-dominated Peace Party and the revival of the Congress will have to overcome the SP
 khan ne aise vakt main phir se sapa kaa daaman thama he, jab vah musalamaanon main saakh ke sankat se guzar rahi he
 Many leaders in the party have become his enemies
 kya ve us shatruta ko sachmuch bhula paaenge? sapa yadavon or musalamaanon ke paaramparik vot bank ko phir se apane paale main laane kii koshish karti rahi he, par kai duusare pahaluon par bhi use kaam karnaa hoga
 After Amar Singh's departure, the support of Rajputs from the party has also shifted mainly towards the BSP
 brahmanon ko apane paale main kar chukin mayawati ab rajput iees-ipies afasaron ko ahm padon par laga rahi hai or rajput netaaon ko bhi lubhaa rahi hai
 In contrast, Mulayam feels that the muslim-yadav support base will surpass his fleet in the 2012 election
 sapa chhodkar gaye duusare netaaon ko bhi laane ke liye unke sampark main bane jetali kaa ab purvanumaan he, ''khan kii bhavy vaapasi, bihar main congress kii durgati or uttar pradesh main basapa kaa kushasan, in sab pahaluon ne mulaayam se dur gaye kai netaaon ko dobaaraa paas aane ke liye prerit kiya he
 But the question is: Will the SP, which is struggling with the crisis of credibility, be able to stand up to public sentiments with the return of some such leaders? pakistan kii videshmantri hina rabbaani khaar kaa kahana he ki pakistani sansad abhi zyada puraani nahin he or unke mulk main thodi gadabad chal rahi he, lekin jald hi sabakuch saamaanya ho jayega
 Hina Rabbani, who arrived in Davos to attend the World Economic Forum's conference, said on Thursday, "pakistan is not like what the outside world sees
" pakistan main sansad kaaphi nai he
 People are yet to adopt it
 ’’tippaniyan He said, "there is a little tussle going on, but it is not a very bad situation
" chijen bahut jald thik ho jaaengi
 During the debate on 'democracy' in the conference, the Pakistani foreign minister targeted the developed countries and said that these people had supported the military dictatorship in Pakistan
 unhone kaha, ‘‘duniya ke kuch behad paripakv or bade loktantric deshon ne pakistan main sainya sarkaron kaa samarthan kiya
 Undemocratic system remains in many countries of the world even today
 viksit duniya se pakistan main sainya netritv ke liye samarthan aata rahaa he
 '' unhone kaha, ‘‘thodi khinchataan chal rahi he, lekin yah bahut kharaab sthiti nahin he
 Things will get fixed very soon
 ’’ sammelan main ‘loktantr’ par yojit bahes ke dauraan pakistani videshmantri ne viksit deshon par nishaanaa saadhaa or kaha ki inhen logon ne pakistan main sainya taanaashaahee kaa samarthan kiya tha
 He said, "some of the world's most mature and large democratic countries supported military governments in Pakistan
" duniya ke kai deshon main aaj bhi aloktantric vyavastha bani hui he
 There has been support for military leadership in Pakistan from the developed world
 ’’ He said, "some of the world's most mature and large democratic countries supported military governments in Pakistan

 com / jvi3xspimw— Narendra Modi (@narendramodi)march 4, 2019kyon itnaa jaruri he masood ajahar
 
 
 Let us tell you that Masood Azhar is one of the number one enemies of India
 sirf pulavama aatanki hamalaa hi nahin isse pehle bhi kai aise aatanki hamale jaish-e-mohammad ne bharat main kiye hai
 Every day, security forces also encounter Jash terrorists in Kashmir
 padhein kitna bada paapi he masood ajahar- jab hamaari sansad par aatankwaadi hamalaa hua to iske peeche tha moulana masood ajahar- jab pathankot main sena ke camp par aatanki hamalaa hua to iske peeche bhi tha moulana masood ajahar- jab uri main sena ke camp par aatanki hamalaa hua to iske peeche bhi tha moulana masood ajahar- pulavama main siarpief ke 40 jambaajon par hue aatanki hamale or unki shahadat ke peeche bhi tha moulana masood ajaharato phir aise aatankwaadi ko antarrashtriya aatankwaadi kyon nahin mana janaa chahie
 India has been raising this question on Pakistan for the past 10 years and Pakistan has been forgetting its humble faith and even the religion of the neighboring country in the defense of Musuj Azhar
 UNSC main bhi ghiregaa masood ajaharbharat ne 2009 main masood ajahar ko antarrashtriya aatankwaadi ghoshit karne kaa prastaav daalaa tha
 But in the 1267 Sanction Committee of the United Nations Security Council, China stopped it by imposing its veto power
 baad main 2016 or 2017 main bhi bharat ne iske liye sanyukt raashtra kaa darwaja khatkhataya lekin china ne apane vito kii kundi hameshaa laga di
 Whereas in the United Nations Security Council, four other veto power countries, America, Russia, France and Britain were in favor of India
 badale halaat main agar pakistan masood ajahar ko global aatankwaadi maanane main baadha nahin daalata he to china bhi apane vito power se peeche hat saktaa he
 The history of Masood is quite old
 Pakistan had given all its strength to save Masood Azhar, the mastermind of Pulwama terror attack
 lekin ek to hindustan is baar aar-paar kii mudra main he or usapar se antarrashtriya birdari bhi masood ajahar ko bakhshane ke mood main nahin he
 Then Pakistan also loosened its attitude
 kareeb 20 saal pehle jaish-e-mohammad ke aatanki sargana masood ajahar kaa naam charchaa main tab aayaa jab qandahar vimaan apharan maamle main 160 logon kii jaan bachaane ke liye bharat ne masood samet teen aatankwaadiyon ko reeha kiya tha
 But it cost a lot
 masood ne bharat main ek ke baad ek kai aatanki hamale kiye
 Ahead of the crucial talks on the Gorkhaland issue tomorrow, Union Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee said on Sunday that the issue could be resolved through dialogue and warned that the situation could be fragile if the GJM leadership remained adamant on the demand for a separate state
 yah puche jane par ki kya gorkhaland kii maang kaa samaadhaan baatcheet ke jariye nikaala ja saktaa he, mukherjee ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ‘‘meraa maananaa he ki aisi koi bhi samasya nahin he jiskaa baatcheet ke jariye samaadhaan nahin nikal saktaa
 On being pointed out that the Gorkhaland Mukti Morcha (GJM) is adamant on its demand for a separate state, Mukherjee said, "if anyone is adamant about their demand and does not act softly, then the situation can become fragile
" ’’mukherjee ne kaha, ‘‘kendriya grih mantri pi chidambaram pehle hi is bare main gorkhaland mukti morcha se apil kar chuke hai tathaa main nishcint hum ki samasya kaa samaadhaan baatcheet se nikal saktaa he
 In response to Chidambaram's appeal, the GJM yesterday decided to grant relaxation in the indefinite hunger strike to be held in Darjeeling to create a suitable environment for the trilateral meeting to be held on Monday
 pradhanmantri narendra modi shanivaar se purvottar rajyon ke chaar divasiy daure par hai
 He will be in the Northeast for the first time after becoming Prime Minister
 is daure kaa pehla padaav assam main hoga
 Where today, annual conference of Directors General of Police across the country is starting
 piem modi is conference kaa udghaatan karenge or phir police mahanideshkon ko sambodhit karenge
 Home Minister Rajnath Singh will also be present in the meeting
 pehali baar ye conference dilli se baahar ho rahi he
 At the same time, on Sunday, PM Modi will address the BJP rally at the Indira Gandhi Athletic Stadium in Goahati
 pradhanmantri kii yatra se thik do din pehle govahati se barood kaa zakira pakade jane ke baad suraksha kadi kar di gai he
 Apart from this, PM will also visit Tripura, Nagaland and Manipur
 iske baad pradhanmantri meghalaya se assam ke liye ek rail line samarpit karenge
 He will also start a power project in Tripura
 nagaland or manipur main bhi kuch kaaryakramon main hissaa lenge
 There has always been a complaint of these states that they have been ignored, in such a situation, this visit of the Prime Minister will be very important in many ways
 main aise bharat main bada hua jahaan netaa or sarkari afasar aam aadmi kii pahunch se hameshaa baahar hote the
 He lived in a world far above the common man from where he preached from time to time
 aam aadmi ke paas unase sawaal poochne or unhen chunauti dene kaa koi jariya nahin hota tha
 All this has changed in the era of social media
 aaj har shaks ke paas taqatvar logon se pratyaksh yaa paroksh sampark karne ke tareeke maujuud hai
 It has carried out a kind of political empowerment
 haalanki kuch log ise bhraamak or satahi maanate hai
 People criticize ministers, ask questions and in return they sometimes get an answer, sometimes they have to brush up
 soshal media forum, samaan dilchaspee vaali community main log apane jaison se milte hai
 Sometimes because of the views expressed on Twitter or Facebook, they also become tools of political parties and movements
 soshal media ne bharat main nae kism kii raajnneeti ko janm diya he jo hamaare paaramparik tareekon ke bich apane astitv ke sangharsh main lagi he

 Some dialogues of these romantic films of Bollywood will always remain fresh in the mind
 
 
 izzaten, daulatein, shoharatein sabhi kuch miltaa he lekin pyaar kabhi nahin miltaa
 (silsila) Love that is afraid is not love, it is crime
 (mogul-e-aazam)ishk di mere mitra pahchaan kii, mit jaave jad yaara jid apnaan di
 (hello London) True love happens only once in life, and no God or God fails it
 (vir jaaraa)chaahane or hasil karne main bahut fark he, pyaar sirf hasil karne kaa naam nahin, pyaar dene kaa naam he
 (hum dil de chuke sanam) Love is a beautiful feeling that comes like a breeze in our life and the fragrance of our life smells from its fragrance
 (phna)mohabbat kya he, kyon he, kahaan he? (dil to pagal he)pyaar dosti he
 (something happens) Love is also like life, every turn is not easy, happiness is not there at every turn, but when we do not leave life, why leave love with you
 
 
 (mohabbatein)mohabbat main sharten nahin hoti
 
 
 
 to afsos bhi nahin hona chahie
 (loves) Sometimes we lose love to each other, we give love a high status, we stay apart and achieve the height of love, and even if we get love, separation is also a love
 
 
 (kisna)jo pyaar kaamyaab ho uske bare main baat karne kii jarurat nahin hoti, or jo pyaar naakaamayaab ho uske bare main baat karne kaa phayda nahin
 (hum Tum) There is no scope for love in doubt, where there is love, there is nothing but love
 (hamako divaana kar gaye)'pyaar' ko gulzaar ne ek gane main kuch is tarah bayaan kiya he
 
 
 Love no words love no sound

 According to a BBC report, it is not yet clear why the ban has been imposed

 The Information and Communications Technology Authority of Turkey said, 'after technical analysis and discussion on the legal issue, administrative steps were taken regarding this website

 Following the news of the ban on Wikipedia, people voiced their views on social media, saying it could be a move taken by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's Wikipedia page as part of an effort to suppress criticisms

 Opponents like Mamata Banerjee and Lalu were ridiculing it, now JDU president Sharad Yadav, who was in the front, has also started showing his attitude
 sharad yadav ne lakhanu main ek party meeting ke dauraan kaha ki agar meri party ke logon ko upi main loksabhaa chunaav ladane ko nahin mila, to main ek or front bana luungaa
 Yadav also said that the workers should not hold high expectations from this third front

 During this, he said that both the BJP and the Congress are engaged in qawwali

 Yadav said that the idea of a Third Front is limited to Delhi and has no meaning at the local level
 jo kaaryakarta loksabhaa chunaav ladanaa chaahate hai, ve apane aavedan jarur den
 Sharad said that we had also stood our candidates in UP during the 2009 Lok Sabha elections
 bijepi netaa navjot singh siddhu ne rajya sabha kii sadsyta se istifa de diya he
 There is speculation that Sidhu will resign from BJP soon and start his political innings with the Aam Aadmi Party where he could be made the Chief Ministerial candidate for next year's Punjab elections
 siddhu ne bijepi kyun chodi or kya siddhu kaa aap main jane kaa faisla sahi he, aaie ise vistaar se samajhate hai
 The tussle between Sidhu and the BJP started in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections when Arun Jaitley was fielded by the party by removing him from his parliamentary constituency Amritsar
 siddhu 2004 se lekar 2014 tak amritsar se saansad rahe the
 He was so angry with the party's decision at the time that he even refused to campaign for Jaitley
 arun jetali ko punjab ke purv mukhyamantri va congress ummidavaar amarinder singh ne buree tarah haraaya tha
 The party also blamed Jaitley's defeat on Sidhu
 party ke kai bade netaaon ne chunaav ke baad siddhu par aarope lagaae the ki unhone bataur saansad apane lok sabha kshetra main koi kaam nahin kiya or zyada samay tivi kaaryakramon ko host karne main bitaayaa
 Hence, the public got angry and voted against the BJP
 jetali kii amritsar main haar ke aarope ne siddhu or bijepi ke rishton main aag main ghi daalane kaa kaam kiya
 For the past two years, Sidhu and his wife and former BJP MLA Navjot Kaur have repeatedly targeted the Punjab Chief Minister and his ally Akali Dal in the government
 siddhu dampatti akali dal ke kaamkaaz se naakhush the or kai baar bijepi ke varisht netaaon se isaki shikaayat bhi kii lekin unki har baat ko party ne nazarandaaz kiya
 Sidhu's wife had exposed corruption in his own government in a sting a few months ago
 unhone apni sarkaar par gambhir nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha tha ki punjab main laal batti lagi gaadiyaan drugs supplai kaa kaam karti hai
 In the month of April this year, Navjot Kaur also announced her resignation from the BJP through a Facebook post
 vahiin navjot siddhu ne kuch samay pehle ek tivi channel ko die gaye intervyuu main kaha tha ki punjab kaa mukhyamantri bananaa unka sabase bada sapana he
 Sidhu is well aware that he will never be declared CM candidate in the alliance of Akali and BJP
 punjab main janata kaa rosh jhel rahi akali-bijepi sarkaar kii kathinaaiyaan aam aadmi party ke maidan main utarane ke baad or bad gai hai
 The popularity of the AAP is increasing day by day in Punjab and it is discussed everywhere that AAP, which is contesting in Punjab for the first time, can become the largest party in the state elections
 siddhu aap ke siem ummidavaar ke rup main punjab chunaav main maidan main utarkar apane sapane ko puraa karnaa chaahate hai
 At the same time, Sidhu was made a member of the Rajya Sabha by the party about two and a half months ago at the behest of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in view of the Punjab elections
 piem yah acchhee tarah jaanate the ki punjab main akali-bijepi sarkaar ke khilaaf logon kaa gussa badhata ja rahaa he or agar aise main siddhu ko kinare kiya to sthiti or kharaab ho sakati he
 Sidhu was admitted to the hospital due to deteriorating health a few days ago, even when Prime Minister Modi took his treatment by tweeting
 rajyasabha kii sadsyta ke baad agar siddhu party se bhi istifa dete hai to yah piem ke liye ek bada jhatka hoga par jis tarah siddhu or bijepi ke rishte bigadate chale ja rahe the, us lihaaz se ise kisi haroonges faisle ke rup main nahin dekha ja rahaa he
 At the same time, Kejriwal has surrounded the Punjab government badly on the issue of increasing drug trade and corruption
 punjab kii janata bhi aam aadmi party par bharosa jataati nazar aa rahi he 
 Kejriwal, who has dented the BJP in Delhi, is now pushing his head to form a government in Punjab, but Kejriwal is well aware that the party does not have any face in Punjab which is as popular as Prakash Singh Badal and Amarinder Singh
 Ho
 kejariwal jaanate hai ki siddhu behad lokapriy hai or bijepi ke saath unke rishte behad karaab hai
 That is why Kejriwal is seen playing bets on Sidhu in Punjab elections
 iske liye beete kai maheenon se kejariwal or siddhu gupt rup se ek dusre ke sampark main bhi the
 But the bigger question than leaving the Rajya Sabha membership is whether Sidhu's decision to leave BJP and join AAP is right and will you benefit or harm by declaring him as Chief Minister candidate? siddhu bhale hi raajnneeti main ek dashak se bhi zyaada samay se hon lekin is dauraan siddhu ne raajnneeti va jan seva se zyada manoranjan kii duniya ko praathamikta di he
 He has appeared in TV programs more than arguing in Parliament
 isliye kai baar amritsar ke saansad hone ke dauraan janata ne unke laapata hone ke poster lagaae hai kyonki vah vahaan bahut kam hi dekhe jate the
 Apart from this, Sidhu is an outstanding leader and openly expresses his views
 isliye shaayad kejariwal se talmail baitaane main unhen dikkat ho kyonki modi kii tarah kejariwal bhi party main apane alaava kisi or kii chalane nahin dete hai
 At the same time, Sidhu has tied up for many TV shows and sports programs in the coming years, will he cancel his programs after becoming CM candidate? Comments siddhu bhale hi ek achche vaktaa hon par unka itihaas kahata he ki vah raajnneeti ke prati itane gambhir kabhi nahin dikhe ki un par janata siem pad jaisi gambheer zimmedaari ke liye bharosa kar sake
 Even though you consider Sidhu to join the party as a big political feat, many people responded on Twitter that Sidhu will do better to entertain the public than to raise votes during campaigning
 siddhu agar aap kii jhaadu pakad kar apane siem banane ke sapane ko puraa na kar paae to shaayad vah apni raajnneetik pari main hameshaa ke liye clin bold ho jaayenge
 Therefore, Sidhu leaving BJP and joining AAP will not be less than a big challenge
 siddhu or bijepi main khinchataan kii shuruyaat 2014 ke lok sabha chunaav main hui, jab unke sansadeey kshetra amritsar se unhen hataakar arun jetali ko party ne chunaav ladvaya
 Sidhu was an MP from Amritsar from 2004 to 2014
 vah us dauraan party ke faisle se itnaa naaraaz hue ki unhone jetali ke liye prachaar karne se bhi manaa kar diya tha
 Arun Jaitley was badly defeated by former Punjab Chief Minister and Congress candidate Amarinder Singh
 party ne jetali kii haar kaa zimmaa bhi siddhu par phoda
 After the election, many prominent party leaders accused Sidhu of not doing any work in his Lok Sabha constituency as an MP and spent more time hosting TV programs
 isliye janata ne naaraaz hokar bijepi ke khilaaf vot daale
 Jaitley's accusation of defeat in Amritsar added fuel to the relationship between Sidhu and the BJP
 beete do saalon se siddhu or unki patni va purv bijepi vidhayak navjot cor ne kai baar punjab ke mukhyamantri va sarkaar main apane sahyogi akali dal ko nishane par liya
 Sidhu was unhappy with the functioning of the Akali Dal and also complained to senior BJP leaders several times but the party ignored everything
 siddhu kii patni ne kuch maah purv ek sting kar apni hi sarkaar main ho rahe bhrashtachar ko ujagar kiya tha
 Taking a serious attack on his government, he said that red lighted vehicles in Punjab serve drugs
 isi varsh april ke maheene main navjot cor ne fasebuk post ke zariye bijepi se apane istife kaa elaan bhi kar diya tha
 On the other hand, Navjot Sidhu had said in an interview given to a TV channel some time ago that it is his biggest dream to become the Chief Minister of Punjab
 siddhu yah acchhee tarah jaanate hai ki akali or bijepi ke gathbandhan main unhen kabhi siem ummidavaar ghoshit nahin kiya jaayegaa
 The difficulties of the akali-bjp government, which are facing the public's anger in Punjab, have increased further after the Aam Aadmi Party entered the fray
 aap kii lokapriyata punjab main dinon din badhati ja rahi he or sabhi jagah yah charchaa he ki pehali baar punjab main maidan main utar rahi aap pradesh chunaav main sabase badi party ban sakati he
 Sidhu wants to fulfill his dream by contesting the Punjab elections as aap's CM candidate
 vahiin punjab chunaav ke maddenzar pradhanmantri narendra modi ke kehane par siddhu ko party ne kareeb dhai maah purv rajya sabha sadsy banaaya tha
 The PM was well aware that the anger of the people against the akali-bjp government in Punjab is increasing and if the situation is kept aside Sidhu can become worse
 siddhu kuch dinon purv swasthya bigadane ke kaaran aspataal main bhartee hue the tab bhi pradhanmantri modi ne twit karke unka haalchaal liya tha
