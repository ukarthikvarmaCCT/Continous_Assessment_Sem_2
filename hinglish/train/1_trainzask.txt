aapako bataa den ki donon deshon kii seemaa par jari tanaav ke bich bharat or pakistan ke dijiemo ke bich baatcheet hui he
 This dialogue was initiated by Pakistan itself
 yah baatcheet tab hui jab bharat nesamyukt rashtramempakistanke jhuuthon ko duniya ke saamne laane kii koshish kii
 After this, Major General Sahir Shamshad Mirza, the Director General of Military Operation (who heads the military operations there) himself, Lt Gen Anil Kumar Bhatt, DGMO of India spoke on the hotline
 baatcheet aaj dopaher dedh baje ke kareeb hui, yah baatcheet lagbhag 10 minute tak chali
 Pakistan DGMO Major General Sahir Shamshad Mirza accused India of targeting its civilian population in firing
 uske anusaar bharat kii firing main uske 5 naagarik maare gaye
 To this, India's DGMO Lieutenant General AK Bhatt clearly stated that the ceasefire agreement on the border was violated by the Pakistan Rangers
 biguef vahaan iskaa uchit jawaab dene ke liye tainaat he
 Earlier, both the army heads spoke on 20 July
 aapako bataa den ki is saal ab tak pakistan main 500 baar sijafire kaa ulanghan kiya he
 At the same time, more than 300 terrorists have tried to enter India
 vahiin 80 aatankwaadi apane makasad main kaamyaab bhi ho gaye hai
 Bhatt also informed his counterpart Pak General about this
 vahiin haravesting ko dekhte hue pakistan khaskar kisaanon ko nishaanaa bana rahaa he
 On this issue, DGMO Lieutenant General Bhatt stressed to Pakistan that with the help of Pakistani Army, the process of terrorist infiltration attempts on the border is going on continuously
 isse seemaa par shanti bhang ho rahi he
 He said that this is evident from the ongoing sniping by the Pakistani Army at our posts
 dijiemo ne kaha ki bhartiya sena main agar kisi jawan kii jaan jaati he, to uske paas iskaa jawaab dene kaa adhikaar he
 In such a situation, the Indian DGMO has made it clear that they are in favor of peace, but Pakistan should desist from repeated ceasefire violations
 aapako bataa den ki jammu ke arniya sector main pakistan kii ore se firing main biguef kaa ek jawan shahid ho gaya
 Two civilians have also died and many others have been injured

 The Akhil Bhartiya Akhara Parishad warned on Sunday that they would leave the venue if it remained the same
 akhaada parishad ke adhyaksh narendra giri maharaj ne ravivaar ko samvaadadaataaon se kaha ki pehle shahi snaan main prashasnic gadabadi ke kaaran sabhi ko pareshaani kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 The administration has also admitted that the mistake occurred during the first royal bath
 unhone kaha ki prashasan ko galati sudhaarney kaa mauka diya gaya he
 If not improved, they will leave the fair and leave
 isse pehle akhaada parishad ke mahaamantri hari giri ne prashasan par jamkar bhadaas nikaali
 He says that Naga and sage-saints bathe first in the Shahi Snan
 uske baad aam log nahaate hai
 But the Divisional Commissioner and District Magistrate of Ujjain made fun of the traditions and took the plunge first
 unhone kaha ki vaise to ye adhikari jimmedaar ohade par hai lekin apni jimmedaari na nibhaate hue unhone santon kii parampara kaa majaak udaaya he
 If they were to take a bath first, then what was the need to call such a number of sages and do a 'drama' of the royal bath
 parivahan mantri ne diya sudhaar kaa bharosarajya ke parivahan mantri bhupendra singh ne saadhuon dwaara di gai chetavanee par kaha ki vyavasthaaon main sudhaar kiya jayega
 Also the next royal bath will include all 13 akharas
 pahaleshahi snanamen apeksha se bahut kam shraddhalu ujjain pahunche the
 It was claimed by the government that more than 50 lakh devotees would reach the first royal bath
 lekin yah aankada 10 lakh tak bhi nahin pahunchaa
 The saints and saints also faced many problems
 brahma nagari pushkar main ek shaks kii bhakthi kaa anoothaa udhaaharan dekhne ko mila he
 Ajay Rawat has been engaged in writing Hanuman Chalisa for two days and two nights by focusing on the sacred rock of Pushkar soil by remembering God

 Nowadays people do not sit peacefully in front of God even for five minutes
 jabaki mujhe pavitra bhoomi par pavitra hanuman chalisa likhane main kai ghanten lage, lekin mujhe thakaavat nahin hui
 i want to present the glory of Hanuman, the giver of wisdom to Lord Hanuman by writing Hanunan Chalisa on the soil

 ye aankade yah darshane ke liye kaaphi hai ki dilli main badi maatra main hathiyaar pakade ja rahe hai, maamle bhi darj ho rahe hai or aaropee bhi giraftaar ho rahe hai
 But still these weapons are being supplied on a large scale

 Both people have to personally respond to this notice
 ames ke sivio rahete sanjeev chaturvedi ne bhrashtachar ke kai maamalon ko ujagar kiya inamen se 37 bade maamalon kaa zikr hycourt main daayar yachika main kiya gaya
 a large number of senior officials including AIIMS Director, Deputy Director Administration and Registrar are under investigation in these cases
 isi daur main jepi nadda, sanjeev chaturvedi ko ames ke sivio pad se hataane or in sari jaanch ko band karne ke liye us vakt ke swasthya mantri dow harshavardhan ko chitthee likhte rahe
 On which NDTV India had shown the news from Tafsil
 pichley saal chaturvedi ko sivio pad se hataa diya gaya or kuch vakt baad pradhanmantri narendra modi ne jepi nadda ko hi swasthya mantri bana diya jisase kaaphi bavaal khadaa ho gaya tha
 CPM leader Mohammad Salim said after the notice issued by the court today, 'modi government ignored the corruption cases in AIIMS and hindrances put in their investigation
 unhone doshi vyakti ko hi munsif bana diya
 It was totally wrong for Nadda Saheb to be the Health Minister
 is maamle kii puri jaanch honi chahie
 ' ab sipiiel ne apni yachika main maang kii he ki 1) - The court should ensure that the Health Minister does not exercise his authority in the investigation of corruption cases in Nadda AIIMS
 2)- saare 37 bade maamalon kii jaanch hoicourt kii nigaraanee main ho or states report maangi jaae
 3) - After the recommendation made by the Parliamentary Committee, there should be a CBI inquiry about the role of Nadda in this case
 is maamle main hycourt ne nadda or chaturvedi ke alaava swasthya mantralay ke sachiv or mukhya satarkta adhikari ke alaava ames ke nideshak, sivisi ke sachiv or sibiai nideshak ko bhi is maamle main jawaab dene ko kaha gaya he
 Arvind Kejriwal, who formed the government in Delhi with the support of the Janlokpal bill to come on the water electricity bill and then with the unconfirmed support from the Congress, may have left the plank of Delhi by making the Janlokpal bill an issue, but he has not given up many hopes
 unheen ummiido main sampradayikta ke khilaaf gair-sampradayik taaqaton or dalon kii ekajutata karnaa bhi he
 Congress can prove to be a pivot in this
 khaastaur par tab jab anti inkambency factor se party jujh rahi ho or aglaa chunaav jeetna mushkil lag rahaa ho
 To stop Modi, the party is pushing for the Andi peak
 lekin congress ne jaise hi elaan kiya ki varanasi se party ‘apane jhande tale ek majboot ummidavaar utaaregi’, kejariwal camp ko jhatka sa laga
 No political party discloses its strategy, but often waits silently for its favorable position
 ye kejariwal kii raajnneetik chaalaaki hi he ki jis bhrashtachar ke mudde ko hawa dekar ve pehle media or phir raajnneeti main chhaae usee bhrashtachar ke mudde ko peeche chhod ve sampradayikta ke khilaaf khud ko khadaa karte nazar aa rahe hai
 Then he said in one of his statements that communalism is a bigger issue than corruption
 isamen koi do raay nahin ki sampradayik raajnneeti bahut khataranaak pravriti he, lekin kejariwal ke is shift ke peeche vajah kuch or he
 In Delhi, the Congress supported the Kejriwal government and tried to hunt two birds with one stone
 bijepi ko satta se dur rakhana or kejariwal ke unke kiye avyaavhaarik vaadon ko lekar janata ke saamne expos karnaa
 How far Congress has managed to achieve its goal is a separate issue of debate, but this support of Congress gave a new dimension to Kejriwal's political ambition
 ve ye maanane lage ki congress ke dushman number van modi ke khilaaf khadey hokar ve na sirf congress balki un tamaam raajnneetik dalon kaa maun samarthan hasil kar lenge jo modi ko pani pi pi kar koste rahete hai
 In politics it is said that the enemy of an enemy is a friend
 isi formule ke tahat kejariwal ne water testing ke liye pehle apni party ke netaaon se bayaan dilvaaya ki modi agar varanasi se ladenge to kejariwal ko unke khilaaf ladanaa chahie
 Even when Modi's Varanasi candidacy was decided, Kejriwal did not directly announce his candidature
 kaha ve banaras kii janata se puuchhenge
 In Indian democracy, it is never the case that people elect someone before the election
 lekin jaisaa ki kejariwal kaa tareeqa he, wo har kaam aam aadmi ke kandhe par rakh kar karte dikhnaa chaahate hai
 So, the direct statement from the public asking here meant that they need some time
 time isliye ki is bich wo apni ummidavaari ko lekar khaastaur par congress kaa rukh jaan le
 His hope got a further boost when Anil Shastri, a Congress leader and considered close to 10 Janpath, tweeted that if BSP and SP are serious against Modi, they should decide on a common candidate with the Congress
 isi twit ke kram main jab unase poocha gaya ki kya ve chahenge ki 'sampradayik taaqaton se desh ko bachaane ke liye congress or aam aadmi party ko haath milaanaa chahie’ to unhone jawaab diya ‘haa main sahamat hum
 ' is babat jab congress party se poocha gaya to party ne kaha ki anil shastri ek vyapak paridrishy kii baat kar rahe hai, varanasi kii ek seat ke liye nahin
 To defeat Modi, the Congress could play bets with Kejriwal, which was indicated by Anil Shastri in Delhi and Rita Bahuguna Joshi in Lucknow
 lekin, party ko andeshaa hua ki aisa karne par secular netaa ke taur par ve kejariwal ko aisa ubhaar mil jayega jiske chalate congress secularism kii apni zamin kho degi
 The party also felt the danger of resentment of the party leaders who expressed unhappiness over the decision to support Kejriwal to form the government in Delhi
 bijepi ko bhi taal thokane kaa mauqaa mil jaataa ki jo wo kahati rahi he wo sach sabit hua, kejariwal congress kii hi bi team he
 This is the reason why the Congress has agreed to give a strong candidate, not thinking too much on the outcome of Varanasi
 kejariwal kii ummiido par ye kisi jatke se kam nahin

 While praising the current Indian team, the great opener and cricket critic Sunil Gavaskar also gave a befitting reply to critics who tried to reduce the importance of the series win by saying that the current Australian team is weak
 bharat ne chaar maichon kii siries par 2-1 se kabja kiya jo ki australian sarajameen par uski pehali test siries jeet he
 According to Team India's critics, India won this due to the absence of Steve Smith and David Warner, who were facing a ban due to ball tampering, but Gavaskar refused to accept it
 gavaskar (sunil Gavaskar) ne match ke baad soni sicks par kaarykram main kaha, ‘australian team agar david warner or steve smith ke bina kheli to yah bharat kii galati nahin he
 Cricket Australia (CA) could have imposed a short-term ban on them, but it was certainly agreed that a one-year ban would prove to be good for Australian cricket as they wanted to set an example
 'IND vs AUS: raashtrapati ramnath kovind, piem narendra modi sahit diggajon ne di team india ko badhaigavaskar (sunil Gavaskar) bole, ‘bharat ke saamne jo team utaari gai, vah uske khilaaf khelaa or yah bahut badi uplabdhi he
 According to Gavaskar, the main difference between Kohli's team and former teams is fitness
 unhone kaha, ‘ham bhi jeet ke liye khele the lekin fitness ke maamle main yah team bhinn str par he or captain isamen udhaaharan pesh karata he
 In our time we used to pay attention to our fitness in private

 aadhyatmik uniwarsity ke naam par ashleelata kaa paakhand failaane ke aaropee baba virendra dev dikshit ke dimaag main kisi-kisi baaten bhari thim, ye jaanakar ab baba ke ashramon kii jaanch kar rahi team bhi hairaan hai
 Would you believe that Virendra Dev Dixit not only gave strange instructions to the girls living in his ashram to call him, but also demanded the same percentage of love for himself from these girls
 dilli mahila ayog kii maane to ashram se mili dastavezon main aisi bahut si aapattijanak baaten darj hai, jinka khuleam zikr karnaa bhi munasib nahin
 See the story of Gyan Ganga, who came out of Mukherwind, Virendra Dev Dixit, the greatest Chancellor of the University of Ayyashi, see what and how this Baba used to give advice to new age young girls to avoid bad dreams
 wo kamasin ladakiyon se kahata tha 'baap ke saath so jaao, akele nahin
 Do you sleep alone, only then dreams come
 agar baap ke saath soo, to kabhi aise swapn nahin aa sakate
 'now see the second glimpse of the knowledge of this Baba ji, how he became the self-proclaimed father of thousands of young daughters and taught them how to share the percentage in love
 wo ladakiyon se kahata he 'yadi kisi bhi vastu or apni deh main apnaapan he, to zarur baap se lav main percentage he, apanepan ko mitaanaa hi, swayan main baap kii samanta ko laana he
 Two main things have to be kept in the target form
 ek to lav, doosraa lavalin
 Whatever is lovely, it can remain as lovely
 'or akhir main tamaam hadon se neeche gir kar isi baba kii gandi jehniyat kaa ek or subut dekhie
 The girls whom he has been pretending to tell his daughter in front of the world till now, what and what things were filled in his mind for those girls, 'many Kumaris are also very dirty
 kitna bhi samjhaao, samajhati nahin
 The bus is full of drinking
 kaat-kataari chalaave, pive, vahi chintan chalata rahata he
 There are also such
 "sun kar yakeen karnaa bhi mushkil ho jaae
 The brain becomes numb
 kaan ke parde jhanjhna jaaen
 But it is a pity that until all the superstition falls on the eyes, all these things come in the ears, but do not come in the mind
 tabhi to koi ek-do, das-bees yaa pachchis-pachaas nahin, balki maas histeria vaali beemaari kii tarah hazaron log apni-apni betiyon ko aadhyatm kaa paath padhaane ke liye aise hi dhaporshankhi baabon ke dere par pahunchaakar lambii tanakar so jate hai
 On the other hand, Baba feeds Vogul with innocent and kamasin girls by killing the trust of the parents that by the time their pole is exposed, thousands of girls are cluttered, their lives are ruined
 yakeen nahin aata, to suniye dilli mahila ayog kii adhyaksh swati maliwal ke bayaan dekhie, jinhone apni ankhon se is baba virendra dev dikshit ke ashram main aisi-aisi chizein dekhin ki unke liye khud apni ankhon par yakeen karnaa hi mushkil ho gaya
 Complaints of girls being held hostage in Virendra Dev Dixit's ashram had been coming for a long time
 lekin haqiqat yahi he ki hamaari police ne kabhi in shikayaton ko utani gambhirtha se nahin liya, jitna lenaa chahie tha
 As a result, under the nose of the law, a new brick was added to the University of Ayyashi in the capital of the country every day, and every day the building of sin continued to grow several inches higher
 magar hai court ke aadesh or dilli mahila ayog ke hastkshep ke baad ab is baba ke alag-alag ashramon main bandhak banaai gai saikadon ladkiyaan to kair azaad ho rahi hai, inhen ashramon main aisi chizein or dastauez mil rahe hai, jo aadhyatm ke naam par chalate atyaachaar kii gavaahi dete hai
 Moreover, these lines above are also part of the books of the same discourse of Baba Virendra Dev Dixit, from which he used to share knowledge among the Sadhvis
 asal main ye baba khud ko bhagwaan bataaya karata tha
 Even when he used to compare himself to Lord Krishna and 16 thousand queens of the same Lord Krishna to the innocent girls, he did not open his mouth even when he used to do so
 magar ab vakt badal chukaa he
 The girls are speaking, the locks of the Killenuma Ashram are breaking and Baba is absconding by chance

 bahut barish hui thi
 Then we came to mind that what we will do in this bad weather was always whether we will be able to go in this season or not
 uske baad exparts kaa opinian aayaa ki agar ham taarikh badal den, to kya hoga
 i had two subjects in mind
 ek gopneeyata thi or doosraa, maine kaha ki main koi aisa vyakti nahin hum jo vigyaan jaanata ho
 i said, if there is so much cloud and rain, then there is an advantage

 My RAW vision is that this cloud can also benefit us

 Apart from Salman Khan, actors Bobby Deol, Anil Kapoor, Daisy Shah and Jacqueline Fernandes are playing important roles in the film
 abhaya ram subah jaldi uthte hai or uttar pradesh main itawa jile ke saifai gaanv main apane ghar ke paas choti-si goshaala main pahunch jate hai
 These elderly people above the age of 70 spend many hours there and monitor the work of bathing cows, feeding fodder and milking them in front of them
 gobar kii gandh se bephikr ve goshaala main hi dopaher kii neend lete hai
 This hut is now left in Saifai, which reminds them of the old days
 abhaya ram badaayun ke saansad dharmendra yadav ke pita or samaajawaadee party (sapa) ke adhyaksh mulaayam singh yadav ke chote bhai hai
 Being a constituency of Mulayam Singh, this village has become like an oasis in a desert in the last two decades
 yahaan kii jameen kabhi banjar hua karti thi, jahaan kii mitti khaari thi
 But Saifai has now shone, with three of the best schools equipped with modern laboratories of science and a degree college spread over 65 acres with an auditorium with a digital sound system
 yahaan 800 bistaron vaala aspataal he, jahaan har saal lagbhag 5,00,000 marijon kaa ilaaj kiya jaataa he
 Saifai also has an astroturf sports college and runway
 itani sari suvidhaayen yahaan kii sirf 7,000 kii aabaadi or baahar se aae kareeb 5,000 karmchaariyon ke liye hai
 This is nothing less than a gift to Mulayam's ancestral village
 bharat ke baaki gaanvon main bijli, pine kaa pani, shauchalay, sadak, skool or berogari jaisi samasyaayein aaj bhi aam aadmi ko sata rahi hai, lekin rajnatik sangrakshan main phalne-phoolne vaale saifai jaise kuch gaanv apwaad ban gaye hai
 These areas have been developed with grandeur like the city of Khwabas, where all the basic facilities are available within a few hundred meters
 aaj is tarah kii shandaar jagahen puure desh main dekhi ja sakati hai
 The special thing is that few such villages in the country have been developed under regional satraps
 is tarah ke vikaas kii vajah kuch had tak kshatrapon kaa apane gaanv se lagaav rahaa he, to thodi-bahut seva kii bhaavana bhi ek vajah rahi he
 But the main reason behind this development has been to build a political stronghold so that no one can beat them from there, whether there is a wave or not
 in jagahon kaa vikaas aasapaas ke ilaakon kii dasha ke ekadam vipareet hota he, jo yah dikhaata he ki hamaare netaaon main swaarth kii bhaavana kitni kuta-kuta kar bhari hoti he
 The story of Baramati, the region of Sharad Pawar in Maharashtra, is also similar
 yah ilaaka kabhi ujaad hua karata tha, lekin aaj yah kheti ke liye makul ban gaya he, jahaan ganna, anaar, angoor, kelaa, jowar or bajre kii lahalhati kheti ho rahi he
 For irrigation, 60 km long canal has been brought from the Veer dam on the Neera river
 punjab kaa bathinda bhi ek misaal he, jise mukhyamantri prakaash singh badal ke parivaar ne 2009 main unki bahu harsimrat cor ke saansad chune jane ke baad kaaphi viksit kar daalaa he
 a grand mall has been erected on the banks of the idle lake here
 paison kii tangi jhelane ke baavjood rajya sarkaar ne pichley paanch saal main is kshetra ko 3,295 karod ru
 Has provided
 haryana ke rohtak kii kahani bhi kuch aisi hi he
 The district has become the center of primary education and industries of the country under the umbrella of the Chief Minister of the state, Bhupinder Singh Hooda and his MP son Deepender
 asian paints, amul deyari, sujuki motorcycle or nippan carbide ne pichley teen saal main shahar ke industrial model toun main 5,000 karod ru
 Has invested madhya pradesh kaa chhindwara bhi aisa hi ek udhaaharan he
 Here too companies like Suryavanshi Mills and Raymond have invested heavily
 kendriya mantri camel nath kii chhatrachhaaya main yah jila bipio kaa centre banataa ja rahaa he
 The story behind the development of such areas is the same
 yaa to kisi netaa kaa parivaar rajya kii satta main hota he, yaa phir us kshetra kaa netaa centre sarkaar main apni rajnatik haisiyat rakhata he or nitigat faislon ko apni marji ke mutabik, prabhavit kar saktaa he
 Whatever be the reasons for the leaders doing this kind of work, it cannot be denied that the lives of the residents of these specific areas have improved
 misaal ke taur par saifai aaj 150 kimi ke daayre main rahane vaale logon ke liye shiksha, swasthya or khelkud kaa centre ban gaya he
 People there no longer need to move to Agra or Kanpur for these facilities
 uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav kehete hai, “yah kahana ki yah parivaar kaa project he, bilkul galat sabit ho jaataa he
 See, how many people are benefiting from Saifai's hospital only
 ” deepender bhi rohtak ke bare main isi tarah kaa daawa karte hai
 He says that he has acquired a new All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) for his constituency
 lekin amethi or raibareli jaise viypi kshetra gandhi parivaar kii vajah se bade project paane ke baavjood vikaas ke maamle main kaaphi peeche hai
 20,000 crore in Rae Bareli for about Rs
 kaa investment hua he, jisamen projects kaa aadhunikeekaran or kuch nae projects shaamil hai
 These include the Rail Coach Factory established in 2012
 isi tarah amethi, khaskar jagadishpur industrial aria main kareeb 10,000 karod ru
 Investments have been made
 lekin in investments se sthaneey logon ko koi khaas phayda nahin hua he
 At least 15 major factories in Rae Bareli, including Modi Carpets, UP State Spinning Company and Vespa Car Company, have been closed in the last 15 years due to lack of electricity and other basic services
 jila shram vibhaag ke mutabik, aadhe se zyada laghu udyogon kaa kaarobaar lagbhag khatm ho chukaa he
 In Amethi, at least six factories, including Usha Steel and Arif Cements, have closed in the last 15 years due to these problems
 isamen koi shaq nahin ki sirf mahanagaron main nahin balki, asli bharat main hone vaale vikaas se hi desh main vikaas kii tasviir badalegi
 But the leaders aspiring for change are leaving the rest of the country in the lurch and only developing their own constituencies and making them development models
 saadhaaran kshetra to saansadon ko vikaas ke liye saal main milane vaale mahaj 5 karod ru
 But we are dependent

 Opening batsman Shikhar Dhawan's brilliant century and his unbroken 239-run unbroken first wicket partnership with Murali Vijay saw India score 239 runs without losing a wicket on the rain-affected first day of the only cricket Test against Bangladesh
 sidney test main shatak jadne vaale lokesh rahul ke biimaar hone se mili maukey kaa puraa phayda uthaate hue dhawan ne shuruyaat se hi dabadabaa banaate hue 158 gend main 21 chaukon kii madad se naabad 150 ran kii pari kheli
 Opener Vijay, playing well with Dhawan, scored 89 not out off 178 balls in the opposite style
 aaj hue 56 over ke khel main bhartiya salaami ballebaajon kaa adhik pareshaani kaa saamana nahin karnaa padaa, jisase captain viraat kohli kaa toss jitkar pehle ballebaaji karne kaa faisla sahi sabit hua
 Dhawan and Vijay have shared more than 200 runs for the second time in Test cricket
 isse pehle in donon ne 2013 main mohali main 289 ran kii saajhedaari kii thi
 Both batsmen bowled positively from the start and scored runs easily against the bowlers of the hosts
 dhimi or sapaat pich par bangladesh kii spinneron kii chaukadi ko pareshaani kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Saqib Al Hasan (34 runs without wickets in nine overs), Taizul Islam (55 runs without wickets in 12 overs), Shuvagata Home (47 runs without wickets in 13 overs) and Zubeer Hussain (41 wickets in seven overs) Runs) failed to stop Indian bowlers from batting free
 dhawan ko haalanki pari ke 24wein over main barish ke khalal se pehle jeevandaan mila, jab baayen haath ke spinner taijul kii gend par shuvagata ne short mid wicket par unka aasaan kaich tapakaa diya
 Left-handed batsman Dhawan was playing 73 runs at the time
 barish ke kaaran lagbhag chaar ghante tak khel rukaa rahaa
 Once the game resumed, both batsmen once again looked in rhythm
 vijay ne tej gendbaaj mohammad shahid par chauke ke saath ardhashatak puraa kiya
 Dhawan crossed the score of 90 with a four on Taizul
 iske baad dhawan kuch dhime pad gaye, lekin juber par chauke saath unhone apana teesraa test shatak puraa kiya
 Vijay, on the other hand, started off slow
 dhawan ne shuvagata par chauke ke saath jab sirf 47 gend main ardhashatak puraa kiya tab vah sirf 11 ran banaakar khel rahe the
 He, however, got into rhythm as the day's game progressed and he made some attractive shots
 mejabaan team kaa chaar visheshgy spinneron or ekmaatr tej gendbaaj ke saath utarane kaa faisla galat sabit hua or dhawan ko ran batorne main koi pareshaani nahin hui
 He easily pulled Shahid's short balls when scoring runs easily on the spinners as well
 dhawan ne pari ke chauthe over main saumy sarkaar kii gend ko cover drive se chaar ran ke liye bhejkar pari kaa pehla chaukaa jadaa
 After this, he also saw the boundary of Shahid's ball
 dilli ke baayen haath ke ballebaaj dhawan ne shuvagata kaa swaagat lagaataar do chaukon ke saath kiya
 The comments vijay ne haalanki strike rotate karne ko tarjeeh di or ek chor sanbhale rakhaa
 Captain Dhali and team director Ravi Shastri also praised his performance when Dhawan completed the half-century with a late cut off Shuvagata's ball
 bangladesh ke mukhya spinner saaqib pehle spel ke dauraan prabhavi nahin dikhe or unhone kai dhili gend phenki
 His fulltoss were also sent by Vijay for four runs
 apane sabase tej gendbaaj rubell hossain ko baahar baitaane kaa faisla bangladesh par baari padaa kyonki antim ekadash main shaamil ekmaatr tej gendbaaj shahid (bina wicket ke 52 ran) ke paas bhartiya salaami jodi ko pareshaan karne ke liye vividhta or gati nahin thi
 Taking full advantage of the opportunity given to him by the sickness of Lokesh Rahul, who scored a century in the Sydney Test, Dhawan dominated from the beginning and scored an unbeaten 150-run stand with the help of 21 fours in 158 balls
 salaami ballebaaj vijay ne dhawan kaa acha saath nibhaate hue vipareet andaaj main 178 gend main naabad 89 ran banaae
 Indian openers did not face much trouble in today's 56-over game, which led to the decision of captain Virat Kohli to win the toss and bat first
 dhawan or vijay ne test cricket main duusari baar 200 ran se adhik kii saajhedaari kii he
 Earlier, they had shared a 289-run partnership in Mohali in 2013
 donon ballebaajon ne shuru se hi sakaaratmak gendbaaji kii or mejabaan team ke gendbaajon ke khilaaf aasaani se ran jutaaye
 On a slow and flat pitch, Bangladesh's quartet of spinners faced trouble
 saaqib al hasan (nau over main bina wicket ke 34 ran), taijul islam (12 over main bina wicket ke 55 ran), shuvagata home (13 over main bina wicket ke 47 ran) or juber hossain (saat over main bina wicket ke 41 ran) bhartiya gendbaajon ko svachhand hokar ballebaaji karne se rokane main naakaam rahe
 Dhawan, however, got his life in the 24th over of the innings before the rain disrupted when Shuvagata, off left-arm spinner Taizul, dropped his easy catch at short mid-wicket
 baayen haath ke ballebaaj dhawan us vakt 73 ran bankaar khel rahe the
 The game was halted for about four hours due to rain
 khel dobaaraa shuru hone par ek baar phir donon ballebaaj lay main dikhe
 Vijay completed the half-century with a four over fast bowler Mohammad Shahid
 dhawan ne taijul par chauke ke saath 90 ran ke score ko paar kiya
 After this Dhawan slowed down a bit, but he completed his third Test century with a four over Jubeir
 duusari taraf vijay ne dhimi shuruyaat kii
 When Dhawan hit a half-century in just 47 balls with a four over Shuvagata, he was playing only 11 runs
 vah haalanki din kaa khel aage badhane ke saath lay main aa gaye or unhone kuch aakshark shaat lagaae
 The hosts' decision to land with four specialist spinners and the only fast bowler proved to be wrong and Dhawan had no problem in scoring runs
 unhone shahid kii short gendon ko aasaani se pul kiya jab spinneron par bhi aasaani se ran batore
 Dhawan hit the first four of the innings by sending Soumya Sarkar's ball for four runs in the fourth over of the innings
 unhone iske baad shahid kii gend ko bhi boundry ke darshan karaae
 Delhi's left-handed batsman Dhawan welcomed Shuvagata with two consecutive fours
 tippaniyan Vijay, however, preferred to rotate the strike and held one end
 dhawan ne jab shuvagata kii gend par let cat se chaukaa jadkar ardhashatak puraa kiya to captain kohli or team nideshak ravi shastri ne bhi taaliyaan bajaakar unke pradarshan kii saraahna kii
 Bangladesh chief spinner Saqib did not look effective during the first spell and bowled several loose balls
 unki phultos ko vijay ne chaar ran ke liye bhi bheja
 The decision to drop their fastest bowler, Rubel Hossain, prevailed over Bangladesh as Shahid, the only fast bowler in the playing XI, did not have the variety and pace to upset the Indian opening pair

 duniyabar main aatankwaad ke mudde par buree tarah ghirne ke baad pakistan ne mumbai aatanki hamale ke mastermind hafiz said ko giraftaar kar liya he
 However, this action is not to punish terrorist Hafiz Saeed or to end terrorism, but to throw dust in the eyes of the world
 pakistan kii pole uske ek purv rajanyik ne hi khol di he
 Wajid Shamsul Hasan, a former Pakistani diplomat in Britain, said that the arrest of Hafiz Saeed is a mere sham
 isaki hakeekat yah he ki pakistan ne duniya ko gumraah karne ke liye aatank ke aakaa hafiz said ko giraftaar kiya he
 Wajid Shamsul Hasan, Pakistan's High Commissioner in Britain, has written an article titled 'the story behind the arrest of Hafiz Saeed' in a news portal titled 'surkhiyan'
 isamen unhone likhaa ki jamaat-ud-daawa ke sargana hafiz said kii nauveen baar giraftaar ke peeche pakistani pradhanmantri imran khan kii washington yatra ko safal banane kii chaal thi
 The former Pakistani diplomat said that immediately after the news of Hafiz Saeed's arrest came to light, US President Donald Trump immediately tweeted
 unhone vaishvik aatanki hafiz said kii giraftaar ko badi kamyaabi bataa daalaa
 Wajid Shamsul Hasan said in his article that Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan is trying to improve the bad image of his government
 haalanki hakeekat yah he ki unke grahamantri ejaj ahamed shah iesai ke ritair brigadier hai
 He is also accused of secretly meeting several terrorist organizations
 iske alaava ejaj ahamed shah par patrkaar denier parl ko agava karne vaale umr said shaikh ko sharan dene kaa aarope he
 He is a suspect in Washington in this case
 aapako bataa den ki hafiz said ko sanyukt raashtra or america ne vaishvik aatanki ghoshit kar rakhaa he
 This is not the first time that Hafiz Saeed, a Mumbai attack terrorist, has been arrested in Pakistan
 isse pehle bhi usko kai baar giraftaar kiya ja chukaa he
 However, he was abandoned every time
 bharat ne pakistan ko mumbai aatanki hamale main hafiz said ke khilaaf saboot bhi de chukaa he, lekin har baar pakistan hafiz said ko giraftaar karne kaa dikhaava karata he
 He then releases her

 The 2002 Naroda village murder case in Gujarat has taken a new turn
 28 farvari, 2002 ko hue hatyakand main 11 log maare gaye the
 Former BJJP minister Maya Kodnani is the main accused in the case
 maaya kodenani ne pichley maheene hi ek arji dekar bijepi rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah samet 14 logon ko gavaah banane kii maang kii thi
 The special court has accepted their demand and has given approval to issue summons to them
 ab is maamle kii pramukh aaropee maaya kodenani bijepi pramukh amit shah ko bataur gavaah bulaakar unase poochtacha kar paaengi
 In interrogation of Amit Shah, Maya Kodnani wants to prove that she was not at the scene on the day of the incident but at her nursing home and Asarwa Civil Hospital at Gujarat Assembly Building, Sola Civil Hospital, Asarwa
 unke mutabik ve vidhansabha or sola civil hospital main amit shah se bhi mili bhi thim jisase yah sabit ho saktaa he ki ve vahaan thim
 It is being said that many leaders including Kodnani and Shah went to Sola Civil Hospital on that day where the bodies of those killed in the Sabarmati train massacre were brought
 vishesh court main jaanch kar rahi esaiti ne 80 gavaahon kii list darj karwaane ke kai maheenon baad kodenani kii is arji se kai logon ko aashcharya ho rahaa he
 About a dozen witnesses, including Mohammad Salim, have testified in the case that Maya Kodnani was present at the scene that day
 saleem ne apni gavaahi main kaha he ki unhone vishwa hindu parishad ke tatkaaleen mahaamantri jayadeep patel or maaya kodenani ko naroda gaanv par ghatnasthal par dekha or unki gadiyon main se hathiyaar lekar logon ne peediton par hamale kiye the
 Shamshad Pathan, the lawyer for the victims, alleges that Maya Kodnani is deliberately witnessing such a political figure to influence the entire case
 haalanki kodenani ke vakil amit patel ye aarope jhuthla rahe hai or kehete hai ki maaya kodenani ko kisi bhi gavaah se apane bachaav main poochtacha karne kaa puraa kanoonee adhikaar he
 The comments maaya kodenani naroda paatia hatyakand maamle main pehle se doshi pai gai hai or unhen umr kaid kii sazaa hui he
 Although out on bail for the last two years due to health reasons
 lekin agar amit shah maaya kodenani ke bachaav main utarate hai to ve us esaiti kaa virodh karte najar aaenge jo sarkaar kii he or jisaki chargeshit ke mutabik maaya kodenani aaropee hai
 Now Maya Kodnani, the prime accused in this case, will be able to call BJP chief Amit Shah as a witness and question him
 amit shah se poochtacha main maaya kodenani ye sabit karnaa chaahati hai ki ve ghatana ke din ghatnasthal par nahin thim balki, gujarat vidhansabha bhawan, sola civil hospital, asarava main apane nursing home or asarava civil hospital main thim
 According to her, she also met Amit Shah in the Assembly and Sola Civil Hospital, which could prove that she was there
 yah kaha ja rahaa he ki kodenani or shah samet kai netaa us din sola civil aspataal gaye the jahaan sabarmati train hatyakand main maare gaye logon ke shav laae gaye the
 Many months are surprised by this application of Kodnani after several months after the SIT probing the list of 80 witnesses in the special court
 is maamle main mohammad saleem samet kareeb darjanabhar gavaahon ne gavaahi di he ki maaya kodenani us din ghatnasthal par maujuud thim
 Salim has stated in his testimony that he saw the then General Ministers of Vishwa Hindu Parishad, Jaideep Patel and Maya Kodnani at the spot on Naroda village and attacked the victims with weapons from their vehicles
 peediton ke vakil shamashaad pathan kaa aarope he ki maaya kodenani jaanboojhkar aisi raajnneetik hasti ko gavaah bana rahi hai jisase puure cese par asar daalaa ja sake
 However, Kodnani's lawyer Amit Patel has denied these allegations and says Maya Kodnani has full legal authority to cross-examine any witness in her defense
 tippaniyan Maya Kodnani has already been convicted in the Naroda Patia murder case and has been sentenced to life imprisonment
 haalanki swasthya kaarnon se pichley do saalon se jamaanat par baahar hai
 But if Amit Shah comes to the rescue of Maya Kodnani, he will be seen opposing the SIT which belongs to the government and according to the charge sheet, Maya Kodnani is an accused

 Puri, who attended the India Today Safdigiri Award program, built more toilets than the target set: Bengal did not complete the task in Shoucha-free urban India - Urban Affairs Minister Hardeep Singh Puri at the Purindia Today Safidigiri Award 2019 Openly expressed opinion on the target unhone bataaya ki jo mishan pradhanmantri narendra modi lekar chale the, wo kitna safal rahaa he
 Hardeep Singh Puri said that the target of constructing toilets that the government had taken, has been met by the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki logon kaa mizaaj bhi badal rahaa he, lekin abhi kaaphi badlaav baaki he
 Hardeep Singh Puri said that the urban areas of all the states and union territories have become open defecation free
 ab pashchim bengal ke rup main sirf ek rajya bachaa he, jahaan yah kaam disambar tak puraa ho jayega
 He said that when Bengal completes the work, then the government will achieve its target
 target se zyada toilet banaae gaekendriya mantri hardip singh puri ne toilet nirmaan ke bare main jaankaree di
 He said, 'on August 15, 2014, Prime Minister Narendra Modi told the Red Fort that the greatest tribute would be on the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi that the country should be free from open defecation
 ' hardip puri ne kaha ki sarkaar ne piem modi ke is target par kaam kiya or 65 lakh gharelu yaa nijee toilet or 5 lakh public toilet banane kaa lakshya rakhaa gaya
 Hardeep Singh Puri said that the plan that the government had made in the direction of cleanliness has been completed physically, as an example of which 66 lakh domestic or private toilets have been built and more than 5 lakh public toilets have been constructed
 is
 mantri hardip singh puri ne kaha ki jahaan tak toilet banaakar desh ko shouch mukt banane kii baat thi, wo kaam puraa kar liya gaya he
 Now more change is needed in the nature of the people
 unhone kaha ki logon kaa mizaaj bhi badal rahaa he
 They are working kaaphi badlaav hua he, lekin kaaphi kuch karnaa baaki he
 Getting a writer is like catching a fever
 jab tak teen-chaar log rang-dhangadekhakar ghoshit na kar den ki aap lekhak ho gaye hai to yakeen hi nahin hota or yakeen ho jaae to samaj nahin aata ki le sab hua kaise?mata mridulanandamayi ne to yahaan tak kaha he ki "likhiyapa ek vyaadhi he, jisko lagi uski to lagi
 "it is very difficult for writers to consider themselves as writers
 duniya kahati rahe lekin andar se khud ko samajhaana mushkil hota he ki lekhak ban chuke hai
 In such a situation, it is necessary to encourage those writers who write on the nameplate as soon as they get ahead of elephant-ant and santa-banta
 lekin asal lekhak kabhi khud ko lekhak nahin kahata
 Well tell me if someone has come to haunt humanity for the next few years by wreaking havoc, then how can his face become eerie? The truth is that the writer has always won a guilt
 chap jaae to bhi or na chape to bhi
 Was the guilt that it was worth splashing after printing? And if it is not printed then why not confused? On receiving the money, it seems that if you do not sell your writing and do not get the money then it is a frustration that you do not ask for a penny
 acha likhe to ulahne paata he bura likhe to taane
 a true writer is the one who writes without worrying about money
 aise lekhakon kii zarurat samaaj ko bahut zyada hoti he
 We are talking about the editor society
 kisi bhi lekhak ko do chizon kaa bada afsos hota he
 The first is that he thinks that he is not able to write what he has written before, and if he has read the earlier, then he gets into thinking that why did he write so bad? Writers are the weakest when they are talking And the most powerful when thinking
 lekhak se durbhaagyashaalee or koun ho saktaa he? ek lekhak ke parivarijan
 They do not even know whether they are suffering the fruits of sins of this birth or previous lives? Writer, good or bad, goes to hell because the gods in heaven do not allow them to burst
 kya pataa kab unpar bhi kalam chalaa den? lekin lekhakon kii patniyaan hameshaa baikuntha hi jaati hai
 Hell, 'just let the money come from this article', you suffer while listening and the pleasures of heaven become meaningless for them
 wo yuvatiyaan jo kisi swanaamadhanya lekhak se byaahi jane vaali hai
 This twenty-six January are entitled to receive gallantry awards sitting on elephants
 pareshaan sirf fatehaal lekhak hi nahin hote
 Neither the writer who is not reading or the writer who does not even know the locality grocer
 wo lekhak jo acha likh-chap-dikh rahe hai wo bhi pareshaan hote hai
 If you write something like a fruit, then if you write like a dagger, and if you write something like a lid, then it does not allow you to sleep when it starts writing so bad
 By reading
 shabd itnaa asar chhodte hai ki likhane vaale ko chhod jate hai
 The writer is expected to never complain on his writing and seeing his name because he is a great writer
 ye bilkul aisa he ki aap bade aadmi bananaa chaahate hai badale main puraa mohalla aapke bachche ko apana bataae
 (young satirist Ashish Mishra is an engineer by profession and lives in Indore
 ) Sajjan Kumar, a former Congress leader who was serving a life sentence in the 1984 Sikh riot case, was presented by the jail administration in Delhi's Patiala House Court on Monday
 is baar unako saal 1984 se hi jude sultanpuri sikh danga maamle main pesh kiya gaya
 On Monday, the witness in the case was cross-examined by Sajjan Kumar's lawyer, who had identified Sajjan Kumar in a full court a few days earlier
 is gavaah kaa kahana he ki sajjan kumaar ne logon ko bhadakaayaa tha, jiske baad bheed ne uske bete or pita ko maut ke ghat utaar diya tha
 This witness is none other than Cham Kaur
 somvaar ko cham cor ke cross ejamination ke liye sajjan kumaar ke vakeelon ne kuch or vakt maang liya, jiske baad court ne maamle main 4 farvari kii agali taarikh de di
 Now on February 4, witness Cham Kaur will again undergo cross examination
 pichhali sunwaayee main court ne sajjan kumaar ko pesh karne ke liye production warrant jari kiya tha
 After cross-examination of Cham Kaur, a key witness in the 1984 Sultanpuri Sikh riot case, for about half an hour on Monday, Sajjan Kumar's lawyers told the court that Cham Kaur had recorded his statement in 1987 and 1991 in the same case
 sajjan kumaar ke vakeelon ne kaha ki us vakt cham cor ne bete kii maut ko lekar police ko bayaan nahin diya tha
 Therefore, they do not have the old statement
 unhone iske liye hai court main aavedan kiya he or ummid he ki 30 janvari tak cham cor ke bayaan kii copy mil jaaegi
 Once the old statement comes, he would like to do cross examination once again
 sajjan kumaar ke vakeelon kii daleel sunne ke baad court ne maamle kii sunwaayee 4 farvari ke liye taal di
 Sajjan Kumar's lawyer Anil Sharma asked Cham Kaur a number of questions during the cross examination and alleged that on 14 November 1984, when Cham Kaur made a statement to the police on the riots for the first time, he never said to the police in that His father and son were killed
 sajjan kumaar ke vakil ke is sawaal ke jawaab main cham cor ne kaha ki unhone police se kaha tha ki unke pita or bete kii hatya hui thi, lekin wo padhi likhi nahin he or police ne kya kiya, isaki unako jaankaree nahin he
 However, it is definitely that as soon as he told the police that his father and son had been killed, the police had written something on the papers
 aapako bataa den ki 1984 ke sultanpuri danga maamle main cham cor ahm gavaah he
 Earlier in the last month of last year, the court sentenced Sajjan Kumar to life imprisonment in 1984 Sikh riot cases
 iske baad sajjan kumaar ne congress party se istipha bhi de diya tha

 johnson and johnson vivaad main bharat sarkaar dwaara kadaa rukh akhriyaar karne ke baad company ne shuukravaar ko kaha he ki vah hip implant se pareshaan hue bhartiya marijon ke muaavje ke maamle par bharat sarkaar ke saath kaam karegi
 It is worth noting that a committee of the Central Government had last month said to pay compensation of Rs 20 lakh per month to the company
 haalanki bharat main maujuud marijon ne is muaavje ko kam bataate hue antarrashtriya maanak par muaavje kii maang kii thi
 For the past several years, the patients of hip implants have been struggling against Johnson & Johnson
 iske chalate pichley saal kendra sarkaar ne jaanch kaa aadesh dete hue export samiti kaa gathan kiya tha
 This committee prepared a compensation of 20 lakh rupees to the patients
 vahiin yah muaavja bhi aise marijon ko diya janaa he jinhone pehle hip implant kii shikayaton ke baad revijan surgery bhi karai ho or dikkaton kaa saamana kar rahe hai
 India Today correspondent Rahul Srivastavan also spoke to some patients who have had hip implants during the past decade
 aisi hi ek marij ke parijanon ne bataaya ki export samiti bharat main marijon ko mahaj 20 lakh rupee dene kii baat kar rahi he
 While in other countries, it is paying a large amount to patients with Johnson & Johnson hip implant complaints
 ek aise hi maamle main america court ne johnson and johnson ko lagbhag 50 karod se adhik muaavja dene kaa faisla sunaaya tha
 What is the whole matter? a few days ago some Indian patients who underwent HIP implants, wrote a letter to the Union Health Minister JP Nadda, demanding that the report of the expert committee should be generalized as soon as possible on the complaints of hip implants and that the company was suffering from surgery
 Help get more compensation
 ise padhein: jaane: dollar ke mukaable kyon gir rahaa he rupaya, kyon laachaar he RBI or sarkaar?hip implant ke in marijon ke patr se yah bhi khulaasa hua tha ki desh main hajaaron kii sankhya main aise marij hai jinhone beete kuch saalon ke dauraan hip implant karaayaa he
 For this he resorted to an implant made by Johnson & Johnson
 lekin is surgery ke chalate bade str par marijon ko pareshaani kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 This letter also raises the question as to why it is taking so long to share the report of this committee with patients
 export samiti ke mutabik johnson and johnson ne bhartiya niamak ko is baat kii soochna nahin di thi ki company ke hip implant se australia main kai marijon ko dikkaton kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 At the same time, it was not reported by Johnson & Johnson while taking a new license in 2009 that the patients of his hip implant are having problems worldwide
 haalanki johnson and johnson par lage is aarope par safai dete hue kendra sarkaar ne bataaya ki company dwaara uske sangyaan main yah maamla laayaa gaya tha
 Johnson & Johnson's ASR hip implant is produced by a subsidiary named Depuy
 yah sabsidiari 2006 se lekar agast 2010 tak bharat main 4700 eesaar hip implant bech chuki he
 The subsidiary was closed by Johnson & Johnson in 2010
 gauratlab he ki jab company ko hip implant kii teen sau se adhik shikaayatein mili tab usne helpline seva shuru karte hue kai marijon kii resurgery kii
 Despite this, patients have faced difficulties
 kya chaahate hai hip implant ke marij?bhartiya marijon ke parijanon kaa kahana he ki johnson and johnson ke khilaaf criminal cese daayar kiya janaa chahie
 For this more compensation, patients suffering from hip implant could knock the court
 vahiin iske liye yah bhi jaruri he ki unhen jald se jald export samiti kii report di jaae or report ko aam kiya jaae jisase log jaan saken ki johnson and johnson ne sarkaar ko gumraah karte hue bhartiya marijon ke saath yah khilwaad kiya he
 It is noteworthy that the regulator for manufacture, sale and distribution of drugs in the country had suspended the license of this ASR implant of Johnson & Johnson in 2012
 haalanki in shikayaton ke baavjood company ke khilaaf koi kadam nahin uthaaya gaya
 Now Union Health Minister JP Nadda says that he is looking into the matter

 In an exclusive talk with Upasana's India Today about Kapil's comeback to the show, she said that she was not satisfied with working on the show 'comedy Nights Live' and that there were many problems with the contract for the show
 isliye unhone is sho ko chhodane kaa faisla kiya

 maine isse pehle kabhi itane ghatiya sho main kaam nahin kiya
 It has happened many times that i could not believe at times that this is a script of a comedy show because it used to be so bad
 duusari baat is sho ko lekar mere saath jo bhi kamitment kiye gaye unamem se ek kamitment bhi puraa nahin hua
 "I think his only purpose for taking me on this show was to have a face in the show that has been helpful in giving good TRP to Kickpill shows

 dilli main dengue dastak de chukaa he or ab tak rajdhani main dengue or malaria ko milakar 60 se zyada maamle saamne aa chuke hai, haalanki is bich east emsidi ko dilli se zyada upi ke machhar sata rahe hai
 But why? This is happening because many areas of East Delhi are adjacent to Uttar Pradesh
 east emsidimalaria vibhaag ke karmchaaree in dinon purvi dilli kii galiyon main rojaanaa dawa kaa chhidkaav kar rahe hai
 Even after spraying, the workers do not succeed, spraying medicine in the morning, open tires and coolers to prevent mosquito breeding, but their hard work is proving to be useless in front of the mosquitoes of UP
 ab aap puuchhenge ki bhala dilli main upi ke machharon kaa kya kaam, to aapako bataa den ki purvi dilli ke kai ilaake upi se sate hue hai
 On one side there are Dilshad Gardens adjoining Ghaziabad, several lanes of Nandanagri, Vivek Vihar and on the other side the area of new Ashok Nagar, Dallupura and Vasundhara Enclave adjacent to Noida

 East Delhi Mayor Bipin Bihari Singh will be talking to UP officials, if it is a big problem these days, in which mosquitoes are crossing the UP border and biting people here in Delhi
 meyar ke mutabik is samasya ke samaadhaan ke liye jald hi adhikariyon ko nirdesh die jaaenge ki wo upi ke swasthya vibhaag ke saath baithak karen
 Let us tell you that this year the number of mosquitoes suffering from mosquito-borne diseases has crossed 60
 dengue ke ab tak 28 maamle saamne aa chuke hai to vahiin malaria ke bhi 40 maamle ab tak dilli main darj kiye ja chuke hai
 The Aam Aadmi Party has asked the BJP the question on the logic of MCD that when BJP is the only government in UP, then why is MCD not able to solve the problem
 east emsidi main netaa vipaksh kuldeep ne tanj kasate hue kaha ki upi main bhi to bijepi kii sarkaar he phir upi main bolkar ye log kyon nahin samasya ko khatm karvaa rahe hai
 However, the monsoon is yet to arrive in Delhi, in such a situation, the question arises whether the MCD is not preparing its failure on the mosquitoes of UP? INX media cese main aaropee purv vitt mantri pi chidambaram ko sibiai ne giraftaar kar liya he

 It is difficult to get Chintaman Ganesh's number during the ten-day Ganeshotsav, as devotees from all over the world are calling him and asking for wishes
 bhakton ke bhagwaan ko phone karne kii pratha par tarkwaadi beshak sawaal uthaa sakate hai
 But the strings of this strange dialogue of sentiment are associated with interesting stories of faith
 mandir ke pujari ashok pathak ne bataaya, vaise chintaman ganesh ko unke bhakt kareeb chaar dashak se chitthiyaan likh rahe hai
 But in the high-tech era of communication, from the year 2005, devotees started using mobile phones to bring their wishes to God
 unhone bataaya ki jab bhi koi vyakti mobile phone par chintaman ganesh se ‘baat karne kii’ ichha jataata he, vah phone ko sidhe bhagwaan kii murti ke paas le jate hai or un tak bhakt kaa sandesh pahunchaa dete hai
 Pathak tells that the unique tradition of calling Viraje Chintaman Ganesh in a 1,200-year-old Parmarakala temple began when a devotee hailing from Indore settled in Germany
 yah bhakt hajaaron mile ke faasale se bhagwaan ko niyamit taur par chitthiyaan likhaa karata tha
 Once he called the temple priest

 pathak ke mutabik, ganesh ke bhakt unase kisi antarang mitra kii tarah lambi baat karte hai or bhagwaan ke saamne apana dil kholkar rakh dete hai
 He told that in this Ganeshotsav, the number of such devotees is more, who are praying to God to get a job with good education and good salary
 un ganesh bhakton kii taadaad bhi kam nahin he, jo bhagwaan ke saamne apni yaa apane sage-sambandhi kii shaadi karaane kii guhaar laga rahe hai
 Inspired by the unique waves of faith, these calls are coming for Chintaman Ganesh himself, whose innovative devotees have found an easy way of mobile phones to convey their heart to God in this era of Bhagadori

 Rationalists can undoubtedly question the practice of devotees calling God
 lekin bhav-bhakthi ke is ajab-gajab samvaad ke taar aasthaa kii dilachasp kahaniyon se jude hai
 Ashok Pathak, the priest of the temple, said, his devotees have been writing letters to Chintaman Ganesh for almost four decades
 magar sanchaar ke hitech yug main varsh 2005 se bhakton ne bhagwaan tak apni muraadein pahunchane ke liye mobile phone kaa sahaara lenaa shuru kar diya
 He told that whenever a person wishes to 'talk' to Chintaman Ganesh on a mobile phone, he takes the phone directly to the idol of God and sends the message of the devotee to him

 The government desperately needed the sitting of those legislators on the ruling side, because if the supplementary budget-money bill does not get a majority, the government is likely to fall - had to be passed
 satta paksh ke logon ne us samay raahat kii saans lee jab sarkaar ke sadan prabandhak chaaron vidhayakon ko manaane main safal rahe or matdaan se pehle unhen apni ore le aae
 Ever since Jharkhand was carved out of Bihar on November 15, 2000, in which no party got a clear majority, the crisis-ridden government has been a custom
 tabhi pichley 11 saal main rajya raashtrapati shashan ke do daur ke alaava 8 sarkarein dekh chukaa he
 The Munda-led government is also no exception
 shibu sorain ke netritv vaale jharkhand mukti morcha (jhamumo) ke vidhansabha bhang hone kii ashanka se unhen sitambar, 2010 main samarthan dekar mukhyamantri banane ke baad se munda samarthan waapas liye jane ke khatre ke saaye main ji rahe hai
 However, the arithmetic of the House seems right in favor of the government
 munda ke gathbandhan ko 82 sadasyeey vidhansabha main chaar partiyon ke 46 vidhayakon kaa samarthan hasil he (bhaajapa-18, jhamumo-18, ageesu-5, jad (you)-2, nirdaleey-2 or namit-1) lekin kaary str main unke bich bahut zyada sahrudayata nahin he
 Lack of trust in JMM and BJP is evident
 may, 2010 main sorain ke mukhyamantri pad chhodane ke baad jhamumo ne bhaajapa ko beman se apana samarthan diya tha, isi tarah bhaajapa ko us samay apana samarthan waapas lenaa padaa tha jab jhamumo pramukh ne pichley saal sansad main bhaajapa pryojit katautee prastaav ke dauraan galati se prastaav ke khilaaf vot daal diya tha
 Hemant Soren, the son of Soren, who first became an MLA, was given the post of Deputy Chief Minister
 lekin sorain kii ba sita samet jhamumo ke kai vidhayak kuch bhi hasil na hone ke kaaran naaraaz hai
 The AJSU, JMM and independent legislators are splurging for their share in boards and corporations in exchange for their support to the Munda government, but Munda has not made any appointments, as legislators and party officials, especially in JMM, are taking up these positions
 There is no consensus
 jahaan unke sahyogiyon kaa dabaav baraabar bana hua he vahiin munda ne kuch mahatvapurn kadam aage badaye hai
 On 30 August, Jharkhand became the first state in the country to enact laws to provide services electronically
 electronic seva pradaan vidheyak, 2011 main aay, jati, nivas or sthaayee nivasee praaanpatr jaise praaanpatron ko rajya sarkaar dwaara internet se uplabdh karaane kaa praavdhaan he
 On the same day, Jharkhand has also passed the Right to Service Bill, which holds government officials responsible for providing service to citizens within a specified time frame
 bihar, madhya pradesh or rajasthan ke baad, jharkhand is mile ke pathar vidheyak ko paarit karne vaala desh kaa chauthaa rajya he

 They appear in a little hurry
 delivery tantra par najar rakhane ke liye jahaan ve rajya kaa daura kar rahe hai vahiin unki yojana logon ke sampark main rahane ke liye choubison ghante or saaton din chalane vaale kol centre kii bhi he
 So is the government also worth it, so much trouble for it? The BJP maintains this system, as it does not want to give a walkover to the congress-jvm alliance in Jharkhand
 bihar main bhaajapa ke ek sheersh netaa kehete hai ki bhaajapa ke liye acchhee khabar yah he ki munda ne iske baavjood kaam karke dikhaaya he
 They believe that only the circumstances that Munda has been left to embroil can be dealt with
 munda ko sahyogiyon ko santusht karne ke liye atirikt prayaas bhi karne pad rahe hai-misaal ke liye jhamumo pramukh shibu sorain ko cabinet mantri ke darje se nawaja janaa
 Under increasing pressure, Munda bluntly told his colleagues that as far as the government is concerned, they were thinking 'session by session'
 myne yah ki ve sarkaar chalaane ke liye anuchati dabaav nahin sahenge
 Munda needs to be careful, because the uncertain Shibu Soren — with the same number of 18 mlas as the BJP — will not be deterred by opening his hands
 kuch din pehle hi unhone baari-baari se mukhyamantri pad kaa mudda uthaaya tha-jise bhaajapa ne thukraa diya tha-jhamumo ke supremeo munda sarkaar ko pareshaani main daalane kaa koi mauka kabhi nahin chookte
 Soren's latest attack was that the BJP was discriminating against minorities, which led to Munda taking several steps
 or is sabake baad munda ke paas up-mukhyamantri or varisht bhaajapa netaa raghubar das jaise apni party ke saathi bhi he
 Munda may have to balance a clever balance to control the high and low notes in the alliance, but the circumstances in Jharkhand have certainly increased his stature
