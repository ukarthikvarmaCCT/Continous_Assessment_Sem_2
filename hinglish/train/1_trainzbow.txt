 co / ronjknqavy — Ashwin Ravichandran (@ ashwinravi99) 25 December 2016 maahi ke andaaj kab or kaise prakat hote hai, unke bare main sirf ek hi vyakti jaanata he, or vah hai khud mahendra singh dhoni (mahendra Singh Dhoni)
 Dhoni was criticized all over the world for slow batting in the first match of the series
 un par sawaal uthaae ja rahe the, lekin australia ke khilaaf melbern (melbourne ODI) main tisare vanade (3rd ODI) main siries khatm hote-hote dhoni ne saare sawaalon ko khatm karte hue bataa diya ki jab baat ranon kaa peechha karne kii aati he, to unka koi jod nahin he
 In this case, he has been running for a long time with Virat Kohli, but after the end of the series, Dhoni proved that he is the master of Chase

 com / vbdzxt9msebawa den ki khatm hui teen vanade maichon kii siries main donon tiimon ko milakar mahendra singh dhoni shaun marsh ke baad duusare sabase safal ballebaaj rahe
 But in terms of average, Mahi throws everyone out
 dhoni 193 ran banaakar shaun marsh ke baad duusare sabase kaamyaab ballebaaj rahe
 In terms of average, Shaun Marsh could not reach even half figures around Mahi
 jahaan dhoni ne 193
 Extracted an average of 00, then Marsh averaged 74
 66 kaa rahaa
 Virat, who finished fourth, averaged 51
 00, to rohit sharma kaa everej 61
 It was 66
 baharhaal, maahi ne ek baar phir se dikhaa diya ke lakshya kaa peechha karne main unki koi sani nahin he
 Virat and Dhoni's fans, not only cricket fans around the world, have been debating about this
 aapako bataa den ki apane kariyar ke kul maichon main viraat ne 78 pariyon main 97
 Has scored 4899 runs at an average of 98
 lekin aankadon ke lihaaj se dhoni viraat par baari hai
 Dhoni 103 in 73 innings of his career
 07 ke ausat se 2783 ran banaakar viraat ko ko peeche chhodte hue bataa diya ki chej se guru to philhal vahi hai
 In fact, chasing the target above 100 is enough to tell that when the team chases the target, Dhoni is a mood and level batsman

 uttarakhand main mukhyamantri pad ko lekar chal rahi uhapoh ke bich congress ne aaj sanket diya ki party ne is pad par kisi saansad ko baitaane ke vikalp ko samaapt nahin kiya he or naam kaa faisla jaldi hone kii sambhaavna he
 a day earlier, senior party leader Ghulam Nabi Azad and Congress General Secretary Chaudhary Virender Singh met Union Minister Harish Rawat and MP Vijay Bahuguna
 donon hi mukhyamantri pad ke daavedaar hai
 The Congress had earlier indicated that only the name of an MLA would be considered for the post of Chief Minister, but when reporters in the Parliament complex asked Azad if only one MLA would become the Chief Minister, he said that there is no such criteria
 log khud hi akhabaaron main is tarah kii baaten chhap rahe hai
 No such decision has been taken at the national level whether there will be an MLA or a MP
 unhone kaha ki uttarakhand ke mukhyamantri ke naam kii ghoshnaa aaj yaa kal main kar di jaaegi
 Azad said that there was no problem in forming a government in Uttarakhand
 unhone kaha ki basapa ne bhi sarkaar ko samarthan jataayaa he
 Meanwhile, Union Minister Harish Rawat, who is leading in the race for the post of Chief Minister, hoped that a decision can be taken in the name of the Chief Minister today
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki ham uttarakhand main vidhansabha yaa loksabhaa donon ke hi upachunaav kii sthiti main jeet ke prati aashwast hai
 Ever since Virat Kohli became captain, Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja have been very beneficial bowlers for him
 gharelu sijan main in donon ne bharat ke liye sabase zyada wicket liye hai to sabase 4000 se zyada gende bhi phenki hai
 Yet Virat Kohli says that he will not back down from using them
 test main kaaphi hai kaaphi kifayativiraat kohli ne kaha ki hamen yah dekhnaa padegaa ki hamen limited over main unhen kitna khilaanaa he
 Going forward, we have to play a very long season, and they are very important for us in both the Tests
 kohli kaha ki yahi ek tarika he in logon se varchlod ko kam karne kaa, kyonki jab match chal rahaa hota he to aap yah nahin dekhte hai ki unhone 3000 gend daali he yaa 4000 gend
 On the field, we go only to win
 hamen kisi tarah to unka bhaar kam sakate hai
 Kohli said that we have done this before also, because we have to prepare a core team for the Test matches
 vahiin test ke liye visheshgy boleron ko bhi taiyaar karnaa he
 Virat Kohli said that due to hardness in the pitch on the fifth day, we could not take wickets
 or match main koi nateeja nahin aa paaya

 About this, Sanya told news agency IANS, "I like dance and everything related to it

 But have you ever heard of an incident where the thief would show mercy to you? Yes, an incident where the thief craves and returns the money to you
 maamla china ke shahar heyan kii he
 While a woman was withdrawing her money from an ATM, a thief came and showed the knife to the woman
 chaaku dikhaakar chor ne mahila se paise chhine
 Out of fear, the woman gave 2500 Yuan (about 26 thousand Indian rupees) of all the money withdrawn from the ATM
 lekin chor nahin mana, usne mahila se or paise nikaalane kii jid kii
 Also said that he should show his bank balance
 mahila se paise chhinta chormahila ne chor kii baat maani or chor ko bank membaaki bache paise dikhaane lagi, lekin jaise hi balancescreen par saamne ayachor kaa dil pigal gaya
 The thief noticed that there is not a single rupee left in the woman's bank account
 ye sab dekh chor ko mahila par dayaa ai or unase 1500 Yuan (kareeb 16 hazaar bhartiya rupee) mahila ko bina koi nuksaan pahunchaewapas de die
 Despite this good behavior of the thief, he was caught by the police
 lekin soshal media par log is chor kii kaaphi tarif kar video ko share kar rahe hai
 The world believes Japan to be ironic about technology
 lekin kya japan ke ejiniers ne mahaj 24 ghante main ek shandaar pul bana daalaa? soshal media par japan ke ek pul kii photo viral ho rahi he, jisamen yah daawa kiya gaya ki is pul kaa nirmaan maatr 24 ghante main kiya gaya
 On Sunday, a Facebook page called The Engineer Bro shared this photo with this claim
 india today ke anti phek news war room (AFWA) ne paaya ki yah daawa galat he
 The archived version of this post can be seen here
 The Engineer Bro pej dwaara post kii gai is photo ko khabar likhane tak lagbhag 3000 se bhi zyada log share kar chuke the or 25,000 se zyada logon ne ise like bhi kiya
 Also tell you that this Facebook page is followed by more than 3 million people
 post main photo ke upar angreji main capshan likhaa gaya he, jiskaa hindi anuwaad hoga, "japan ne is pul ko prakritik aapadaa main dhwast hone ke 24 ghante ke bheetar hi khadaa kar diya
 To do this in India, first it takes 3 years in the process and then 5 years apart to make the bridge
 "kya he sacchaiis daawey kii padtaal ke liye AFWA ne pehle is photo ko crop kiya or phir 'japan' kiward ke saath reverse search kiya
 We found many other posts with the same claims and photos, including a link to a tweet in Japanese
 yah twit tt_expwy naam ketvitor handlane 11 november, 2018 ko twitor par post kiya tha
 a translation of that Japanese-language tweet showed that the bridge was built on Japan's National Route Highway 305, which is located on the Eichigen coastline of Japan's Fukui region
 pul vaaki main traasadee main dhwast to hua tha lekin is twit se iske banane kii samay avadhi kaa pataa nahin chalaa
 AFWA then searched the Japanese text on Google and a Japanese news report
 greengo naam kii is japani website par mili lekh ke anuwaad se pataa chalaa ki is rashtriya rajmarg 305 kaa ek hissaa pichley saal 7 july ko hue bhuskhalan ke baad dhwast ho gaya tha
 This article also mentioned that the construction of this bridge started on 27 August and it was opened to the public on 31 October
 iskaa matlab yah ki is pul ke nirmaan main do maheene lage
 In addition, the time span from the tragedy to the restoration of the road is about 4 months
 isse yah sabit hota he ki is pul ke dhwast hone ke 24 ghante ke bheetar banakar taiyaar hone vaale tathy main koi sachai nahin he

 Anna Hazare, who is organizing a nationwide movement against corruption and satyagraha at Rajghat on Wednesday, said that if Baba Ramdev had accepted his condition of not calling any politician on the platform on the issue of black money, he would have sat on hunger strike with him
 anna ne channel live india ke ek vishesh kaarykram main kaha ki vah bhi ramdev ke saath anshan par baithna chaahate the lekin yogaguru ne unki shart nahin maani isliye wo nahin aae
 According to the channel's release, Anna Hazare had placed a condition in front of Ramdev that if no political party leader was called on the stage, he would sit on hunger with him but Ramdev did not accept his condition
 gauratlab he ki ramdev ke anshan main sadhvi rutambhraa ke shaamil hone ko lekar kaaphi aarope lage hai
 Ritambhara is considered close to the BJP and the Sangh
 anna hajaare ne channel se baatcheet main kaha ki yadi sarkaar ne monsoon satr main 15 agast tak lokapal vidheyak ko paarit nahin kiya to vah 16 agast se jantar-mantar par phir se anshan karenge
 Anna said that when four big ministers of the central government went to the airport to pick up Baba Ramdev, then it was understood that something must be wrong and hence he advised Ramdev to take steps
 unhone channel ke sampadak se baatcheet main kaha ki pehle unhen maarane kii sajeesh rachi ja chuki he jo naakaam rahi or abhi bhi unki jaan ko khatra he
 a massive fire in the army's largest arms store took 16 people, including two officers
 sena ke sabase surakshit bhandar main somvaar der raat lagi is aag ko to buja liya gaya, lekin isse nikle gola-barood ke kai sulagate sawaal ab bhi barkaraar he
 Had the Ministry of Defense taken lessons from previous accidents, perhaps an accident like Pulgaon could have been prevented
 haal main raksha maamalon sambandhi sansad kii sthaayee samiti ne gola-barood aapurti kii gunvattta or unke bhandaaran ko lekar raksha mantralay kii khinchaai kii thi
 The committee advised to fix it on top priority

 Given the seriousness of the accident, the DGMO Lieutenant General Ranbir Singh had to come forward and give a statement on behalf of the army

 Also, Army Chief General Dalbir Suhag had reached Pulgam within a few hours
 is bich sena ne ghatana kii jaanch ke aadesh bhi de die hai
 There will also be an apprehension of the conspiracy behind this accident
 beete teen saal main darj hue 10 haadaseis bade haadase ne ek baar phir senaaon ke gola-barood prabandhan kii khaamiyon ke sawaalon ko gaharaa diya he
 This is not the first time an arson incident has occurred

 Not only this, all this is happening when questions of concern have also been raised in Parliament about the arms management of the army, which is facing the shortage of ammunition

 There were 11 types of explosives and weapons in stock, the Indian Army has been battling a shortage of ammunition for a long time

 There can be many reasons for accidents, ranging from poor equipment to carelessness
 sajeesh kii ashanka kii bhi hogi tahakikatsena ke gola-barood bhandar dushman or gaddaaron ke liye bhi aasaan nishaanaa hote hai
 Here a small spark can also cause destruction
 aise main sena ne apane sabase bade hathiyaar bhandar or 16 logon kii jaan lene vaale kii is haadase kii jaanch shuru kar di he
 The possibility of this conspiracy will also be investigated at the bottom of the investigation

 maharashtra main sarkaar banane se bijepi kaa inkaarrajyapal ne ab shivasena se sarkaar banane ke liye poochhamaharashtra main bhartiya janata party or shivasena ke gathbandhan ko chunaav main bahumat to mil gaya, lekin abhi tak rajya main sarkaar nahin ban pai he
 There was a tussle between the two parties over the chief minister's post
 ababijepi ne maharashtra main sarkaar banane se inkaar kar diya he
 On Friday (8 November), Fadnavis submitted his resignation to the Governor
 iske baad shanivaar (9 november) ko rajyapal ne bijepi se sarkaar gathan kii manshaa ke bare main poocha
 Finally, on Sunday (november 10), BJP told Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari that he could not form the government alone
 vahiin duusari ore ravivaar komaharashtra main siyaasi halchal tej rahi
 There were separate marathon meetings of Congress, Shiv Sena and BJP
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki congress vidhayakon ne shivasena ko samarthan dene kii ichha jataai he
 In this regard, senior Congress leader Mallikajurn Kharge will meet the party high command Sonia Gandhi
 vahiin, shivasena netaa sanjay raut ne kaha ki hamaari congress se koi dushmani nahin he
 After the BJP, the Governor asked the Shiv Sena to make a new political turn in the government of Maharashtra
 sarkaar banane se bijepi ke inkaar ke baad ab rajyapal ne duusari sabase badi party shivasena se sarkaar banane ke liye poocha he
 The letter issued by Raj Bhavan said that Shiv Sena wants to form the government
 isse pehle rajyapal kii ore se bijepi se yahi baat poochi gai thi lekin bijepi ne sankhyabal na hone kaa hawala dete hue akele sarkaar banane se inkaar kar diya tha
 What will be the next step of Shiv Sena? The Governor has now asked Shiv Sena to form the government
 shivasena sabase pehle bahumat jutaney kii koshish karegikhyonki uske paas keval 56 vidhayak hai
 In such a situation, it has only two options to form a government
 
 
 - ab shivasena chaahe to sabase pehle congress-ensipi gathbandhan se samarthan maang sakati he
 Because the Shiv Sena cannot form a government with the support of any single party
 lekin ravivaar ko hi congress ke varisht netaa mallikarjun khadge ne kaha ki party ko vipaksh main baithne kaa janadesh janata ne diya he or ham use sweekaar karte hai
 In such a situation, what the Congress wants to do next cannot be said
 -shivasena chaahe to waapas ek baar phir bijepi se badali sharton ke saath baat kar sakati he
 It is being told that Shiv Sena mlas have now put forward Uddhav's name in place of Aditya Thackeray for the post of CM
 iske baad hi shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare ne party vidhayakon se do took kaha he ki ab ham palki nahin uthaaenge nahin balki is baar shivasainik khud us main baithenge
 Now if Shiv Sena talks to BJP with Uddhav Thackeray's face, it could be a new beginning
 devda ne kiya twit, kaha- congress-ensipi ko mili maukacongress ke varisht netaa milind devda ne twit karte hue kaha he ki agar bijepi or shivasena sarkaar nahin bana pain to rajyapal ko ensipi or congress ko sarkaar banane ke liye bulaanaa chahie

 a division bench of Justice BS Chauhan and Justice FM Ibrahim Kalifulla dismissed the petition of the Gujarat government, terming the appointment of Justice Mehta as illegal without the advice of the State Council of Ministers

 The judges said, "the facts of this case reveal a worrying situation in the state of Gujarat where the post of Lokayukta had been vacant for more than nine years
 ’’ The Court also said that the Governor can appoint Lokayukta only with the advice of the Council of Ministers but the Court refused to cancel the appointment of Justice Mehta, saying that the Chief Minister was fully aware of it and sent to him by the Chief Justice of the High Court All letters were received
 sheersh adaalat ne kaha ki aise maamalon main ucch nyaayalay ke mukhya nyaayadhish kii raay ko pramukhataa deni hogi

 In this regard, she was wrongly advised that she could not act as head of state but as a statutory authority

 On the question of the legality of the appointment of Justice Mehta, the two judges of the High Court differed in the case as the third judge, Justice VM Sahai, pronounced his judgment

 Amit Shah said that Mahatma Gandhi, being a visionary, was a very 'clever baniya'

 He had said immediately after independence that the Congress should be dissolved
 shah ne kaha, yah kaam mahatma gandhi ne nahin kiya, lekin ab kuch log congress ko bhang karne kaa kaam kar rahe hai
 The comments congress ne bijepi adhyaksh ke is bayaan kaa virodh kiya

 pyaar ke rishte kabhi hamen himmat dete hai to kai baar yahi naate hamen andar tak tod dete hai
 Every love-filled relationship is full of bickering and wrangling in which much love is hidden
 hamaare isi sukh dukh kii kahaniyon ko ham kai filmi parde par bhi dekhte hai or unase judaa mahasoos karte hai
 This also happens because there is not much difference between reel and real life
 pyaar or family par bani na jaane kitni filmon ne hamaare dil ko chuaa he
 a similar love story has also been shown in the recently released film 'sultan' which teaches us many things to keep the relationship connected
 yun to zyaadaatar log ise salmaan ke fain hone ke naate dekhne gaye hai or shaayad dekhne jaaenge bhi lekin salmaan ke alaava bhi is film bahut kuch he
 The story of the courage of Arfa and the resurrection of the Sultan's passion is also worth seeing in the story of the resurrection of a broken relationship
 aaie jaane, ye paanch baaten jo arafa or sultan ke pyaar se seekhney ko milti hai
 
 
 1
 arafa se sach pyaar sultan ko uske lakshya se jod detaa he or vah ek nakaare ladki kii chhavi se nikalakar ek kaamyaab aadmi ban jaataa he
 That is why it is said that true love lifts you from the floor and brings it to hara
 2
 Sultan does not forget to love even after his heartbreak and when he wins the first wrestling competition, he credits Arifa because his bitter words inspired him to move forward and he understands this very well
 3
 In love and professional life, the two get on well when the two respect each other
 jaise hi ye ek dhaagaa tuutata he unka rishta bhi bikhar jaataa he
 So do not let this link in your relationship become weak and always respect your partner and his words
 4
 At a juncture, the two end their relationship but the love remains intact
 iskaa kaaran hota he unki chuppi
 Whenever this happens, do not be silent, but tell all your heart to your partner
 5
 True love never gives up and it happens in the love story of arfa-sultan
 jab sultan ko arafa ke saath or pyaar kii jarurat hoti he to vah sabakuch bhuulakar waapas aati he
 He forgives all his mistakes and supports him and the Sultan also apologizes to him for his mistake
 isliye hameshaa apane saathi ko maaf karnaa seekhen or uski galatiyon kaa use ehsaas bhi karaaen
 Actress Deepika Padukone is playing the role of Lakshmi in the film Chhapak, being made on Laxmi Agarwal, the survivor of acid attack

 But you will be surprised to know that before the acid attack, Lakshmi's face resembled Deepika
 film kii diarector meghna gulzaar ne pinkavila se baatcheet ke dauraan is bare main bataaya ki chhapaak ke liye unke dimag main hameshaa se hi deepika rahi hai
 Because she had seen pictures of Lakshmi before the acid attack in which Lakshmi looks somewhat like Deepika

 Noted writer Chitra Mudgal has been announced to be awarded the Sahitya Akademi Award 2018 for her 224-page novel 'post Box No-203 Nala Sopara', published from time to time
 yah koi aam upanyaas nahin he
 It is a work created and built on the basis of that particular 'kinnar' section of our society, whose excesses and peculiar antics make us wonder, but their lifestyle is a mystery to us
 kinnar bhi insaan hai
 The heart also beats in them, in which there is also compassion and infinite love
 
 
 unki hoti hai apni yaaden, unka bhi hota he apana bachapan or unamem aseem pyaar karne vaali maa bhi

 There are twigs that are getting restless to run away from the grip of those showers, like i used to be anxious to run away from your hands in the grip of water, swearing in the grip of water

 'angry daggers would shake my face

 On pushing you forcefully in the bathroom, open the tap, water from the bucket on the floor, i used to pretend to take only a bath

 You used to think that i am a lazy lady in terms of bathing

 i have an answer to this! These feet are exactly your feet, that's why i have made them think that your feet are there

 The image of Krishna will be reduced to zero and in your conscience you will hear the melodious melody of the flute from somewhere, which will make your void come with the smell of hundreds of incense sticks
 jab tak tu dikara, bansuri kii mahak main duba hua swayan ko bhuulaa rahegaa, tu gahari neend sota rahegaa
 Hear this, your lullaby does not have that hypnotic power, which can give its children the pleasure of that deep sleep

 Despite his kick, punches, slaps, and hot oil dripping into the ears, he did not agree to be beaten up in spite of the obscene abuses that spared any relationship, nor did the lip-studded saris with star-studded saris be hanged in the ears

 Mulayam Singh Yadav, the head of the ruling Samajwadi Party in Uttar Pradesh, turned 77 on Tuesday
 isi maheene unki party ne 25 saal puure kiye hai
 Some time ago, there was a quarrel in Mulayam's clan
 siyasat kii duniya main netaji ke taur par mashhoor mulaayam ne apane raajnneetik kariyar main tamaam utaar-chadhaav dekhe hai
 Born on 22 November 1939 in Saifai in Etawah district, Mulayam Singh was educated in Etawah, Fatehabad and Agra
 mulaayam kuch dinon tak mainpuri ke karahal sthit jain inter college main praadhyaapak bhi rahe
 Mulayam Singh had two marriages, second in five siblings
 pehali patni malti devi kaa nidhan may 2003 main ho gaya tha
 The current CM of UP Akhilesh Yadav is the son of Mulayam's first wife
 mulaayam kii duusari patni hai sadhana gupta
 When Mulayam confessed to his relationship with Sadhana Gupta in the Supreme Court in February 2007, people came to know about Netaji's second wife
 sadhana gupta se mulaayam ke bete pratik yadav hai
 teacher-turned-mla wrestler Mulayampita Sudhar Singh wanted to make Mulayam a wrestler but after impressing his political mentor Nathusinh in Pahalwani in a wrestling competition held in Mainpuri, he started his political journey from Jaswantnagar, the traditional assembly constituency of Nathusinh
 ram manohar lohia or raaj narayan jaise samaajawaadee vichaardhaara ke netaaon kii chhatrachhaaya main raajnneeti kaa kakehara seekhney vaale mulaayam 28 saal kii umr main pehali baar vidhayak bane
 While his family did not have any political background
 aise main mulaayam ke siyaasi safar main 1967 kaa saal aitihaasik rahaa jab wo pehali baar chunaav jitkar vidhansabha pahunche
 It is another matter that the Samajwadi Party was not even there at that time
 mulaayam sanghat socialist party ke tikat par apane grih janapad itawa kii jaswantnagar seat se arpiai ke ummidavaar ko haraakar vijayi hue the
 Mulayam had to wait till 1977 to become a minister for the first time
 us vakt congress virdohi lahar main uttar pradesh main bhi janata sarkaar bani thi
 cmmulayam Singh Yadav, who was first formed at the age of 50, became the President of the Lok Dal in Uttar Pradesh in the late 1980s, which later became part of the Janata Dal
 mulaayam 1989 main pehali baar uttar pradesh ke siem bane
 In November 1990, when VP Singh's government fell at the Center, Mulayam Singh joined Chandra Shekhar's Janata Dal (samajwadi)
 or congress ke samarthan se siem kii kursi par virajman rahe
 When the Congress withdrew support in April 1991, Mulayam Singh's government fell
 1991 main upi main madhyavadhi chunaav hue jisamen mulaayam singh kii party haar gai or bijepi soobe main satta main ai
 Netaji formed his party in 1992, in October 1992, at Begum Hazrat Mahal Park, Lucknow, Mulayam Singh Yadav announced the formation of Samajwadi Party
 samaajawaadee party kii kahani mulaayam singh ke siyaasi safar ke saath-saath chalati rahi
 When Mulayam Singh Yadav raised his party, he did not have a large support base
 november 1993 main upi main vidhansabha ke chunaav hone the
 The SP chief tied up with the Bahujan Samaj Party to prevent the BJP from coming back to power
 samaajawaadee party kaa yah apana pehla bada prayog tha
 This experiment of Mulayam was also successful in the political atmosphere born after the Babri Masjid demolition
 congress or janata dal ke samarthan se mulaayam singh phir satta main aae or siem bane
 When PM was being formed, Mulayam turned to the politics of the Center with the intention of recognizing the Netaji Samajwadi Party at the national level
 1996 main mulaayam singh yadav 11veen loksabhaa ke liye mainpuri seat se chune gaye
 At that time, Mulayam was also included in the United Front government
 mulaayam desh ke rakshaamantri bane the
 However, this government did not last long
 mulaayam singh yadav ko pradhanmantri banane kii bhi baat chali thi
 He stood in the forefront of the race for the post of Prime Minister, but Lalu Prasad Yadav and Sharad Yadav defied his intention
 iske baad chunaav hue to mulaayam singh sanbhal se loksabhaa main waapas laute
 Actually he also won Kannauj, but from there he made his son Akhilesh Yadav an MP
 2012 main bete ko satta ke sheersh par pahunchaaya2003 ke vidhansabha chunaav main samaajawaadee party ko jeet naseeb hui
 On 29 August 2003, Mulayam Singh Yadav again became the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh
 yah sarkaar chaar saal hi rah pai
 Mulayam Singh was elected out of power in the 2007 assembly elections
 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav main samaajawaadee party kii haalat kharaab hui to mulaayam singh ne bada faisla liya
 In the state assembly, the leader placed the younger brother Shivpal Yadav on the chair of the opposition and himself took command of the politics of Delhi
 2012 ke chunaav se pehle netaji ne apane bete akhilesh yadav ko uttar pradesh sapa kii kaman saunpi
 The 2012 assembly election brought unexpected results in favor of SP
 netaji ne bete akhilesh ko soobe ke siem kii kursi saunp di or samaajawaadee party main duusari peedi ne dastak di
 Mulayam Singh Yadav's family is the largest political family in the country
 aaj kii taarikh main is parivaar ke 20 sadsy samaajawaadee party kaa hissaa hai
 This party claims to follow the ideals of Lohiaji who criticized Nehru's promotion of dynastic politics
 mulaayam singh kii jindagi main kuch aise pal bhi aae jinase wo khud or unka kunba vivaadon main rahe
 The Rampur Tiraha Kandvo was the early 1990s when the demand for Uttarakhand was gaining momentum
 2 oktober 1994 ko alag uttarakhand kii maang ko lekar log dilli raily main shirkat karne ja rahe the
 At that time there was a government of Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh
 bataaya jaataa he ki siem mulaayam ke aadesh par in logon ko mujffarnagar ke paas rampur tirahe par gher liya gaya
 During this time, the police not only lathi-bathed the agitators but also fired
 is ghatana ko rampur tirahaa golibari cond ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 6 people died in this incident
 kuch mahilaon ke saath chhedhkhani or dushkarm ke aarope bhi lage the
 After this incident, an atmosphere of mourning and chaos spread throughout the state
 is ghatana ke baad mulaayam singh yadav kii image ek 'villen' jaisi ho gai thi
 Demonstrations were being held against Mulayam Singh at all places including Dehradun
 22 saal baad bhi is ghatana ke doshiyon ko sajaa nahin mili he
 If the court acquits the friends, then the people of Uttarakhand should hardly forgive Mulayam Singh
 guest house cond2 june 1995 ko lakhanu main hua state guest house cond mulaayam singh ke siyaasi kariyar par sabase bada daag he
 Mulayam was ousted from power the next day due to mistreatment of Bahujan Samaj Party leader Mayawati
 is ghatana se samaajawaadee party kii saakh par bhi isse bada batta laga
 In fact, in the 1993 UP elections, there was an alliance between the BSP and SP, which later won
 mulaayam singh upi ke siem bane
 However, on 2 June 1995 due to mutual tussle, the BSP announced withdrawal of support from the government
 isse mulaayam singh kii sarkaar alpamat main aa gai thi
 Annoyed SP activists surrounded Mayawati by reaching the state guest house on Mirabai Marg, Lucknow
 yahaan mayawati cameraa number-1 main rukii huin thim
 He was also accompanied by the MLA and workers of the BSP
 is dauraan sapa kaaryakartaaon ne unhen marpet kar bandhak bana liya
 Mayawati had locked the door of the room to protect herself
 kareeb 9 ghante bandhak bane rahane ke baad bijepi netaa lalji tandon ne apane samarthakon se saath vahaan pahunchakar mayawati ko vahaan se surakshit nikaala
 After this incident, Mayawati started accepting Lalji Tandon as her brother
 aay se adhik sampatti kaa maamalamulaayam singh yadav or unka parivaar par aay se adhik sampatti ke maamle adaalaton main chale
 In this case, the petition filed in the Supreme Court said that from 1977 when Mulayam Singh Yadav became a minister in Uttar Pradesh for the first time, from 2005 till 2005 his wealth had increased by almost 100 times
 aise main is baat kii jaanch honi chahie ki aakhir itani sampatti unhone or unke parivaar ne kaise arjeet kar lee
 Initially, Mulayam Singh was accused in this case along with his son Akhilesh Yadav, daughter-in-law Dimple Yadav, second son Prateek Yadav
 lekin supreme court ne dimple yadav ko jaanch ke daayre se ye kehete hue baahar kar diya tha ki wo us samay saarvjaanik pad par nahin thim
 The apex court has also dismissed the petition seeking a CBI probe in the case
 yadav parivaar main 'mahabharat'uttar pradesh main aagaamee vidhansabha chunaav se pehle mulaayam singh ke kunbe main jamkar ghamaasan hua
 However, the opposing parties have termed it as a 'drama' prepared under the well thought out strategy of the Yadav family
 is kalah kii sugabugahat us vakt hi shuru ho gai thi jab mulaayam ke saathi rahe amar singh kii samaajawaadee party main ghar vaapasi kaa akhilesh ne virodh kiya
 Akhilesh opposed the merger of Bahubali Mukhtar Ansari's party with the Samajwadi Party with the support of Chacha Shivpal and Amar Singh
 lekin netaji ke aage akhilesh kii nahin chali
 Later Akhilesh Yadav showed the way out of his cabinet to some ministers accused of corruption
 akhilesh ne apni cabinet main ahm mantralayon kaa jimmaa sambhaal rahe chachaa shivpal yadav kii bhi cabinet se chuttee kar di
 Mulayam Singh tried to balance, took away the post of state president from his son and handed it over to his brother
 haalanki baad main shivpal kii cabinet main bhi vaapasi ho gai or kalah kaa yah daur shant hua
 But Akhilesh could not get the post of state president back
 phir akhilesh ne chachaa shivpal samet kuch mantriyon kii apane cabinet se chuttee kar di
 Now another round of discord began in the Yadav family
 mulaayam ke chachere bhai or rajyasabha sadsy ramgopal yadav party se nikaal die gaye
 a few more close friends of Akhilesh were also discharged from the party
 lekin is baar lakh koshishon ke baad bhi chachaa shivpal kii sarkaar main waapas nahin ho saki par ramgopal party main waapas aa gaye hai
 In this way, Mulayam, the expert wrestler of political riot, has united the clan before the elections and the whole Yadav family is seen together in any ceremony

 Kakodkar suggests that the figure may be more than this

 Unlike Karnataka, where 70 per cent of the ore extracted is owned by state-controlled psus, the entire business in Goa is done through private companies, which are dominated by just a few families

 In the exit poll, Congress's doubling seat Ashok Tanwar's rebellion since 2014, kohuda-shailaja Nebeyar Kiyar, in the Haryana Assembly elections, no political party is likely to get a majority

 At the same time, there seems to be an increase in Congress seats this time
 agsit pole ke mutabik rajya main congress ko 30 se 42 siten mil sakati he
 Whereas, JJP seems to get 6 to 10 seats
 agar yah aankade sachai main badalte hai to haryana main vidhansabha trishanku ho sakati he
 The Congress had doubled its seats from the previous time, in 2014 Haryana Assembly elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party got 47 seats
 jabaki, congress ko us samay sirf 15 siten hi naseeb hui thim
 But this time the exit poll is telling that the Congress can get twice the seats in Haryana
 yani is baar haryana main congress ke netaaon ne vaapasi karne kii koshish kii he
 As it is, the main electoral battle in Haryana was directly between the current Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar and former Congress Chief Minister Bhupendra Singh Hooda
 agsit pole ke hisaab se is baar agar haryana main matdaan pratishat dekhen to bhaajapa ko 33 fisadi, congress ko 32 fisadi or jejepi ko 14 fisadi vot milte dikh rahe hai
 Whereas, 21 per cent of the votes are seen in the account of others
 is baar haryana main agar congress ko zyada siten milti hai to iskaa shrey bhupendra singh hooda or kumari shailaja kii jodi ko jayega
 Kumari Selja was made the state Congress president just before the assembly elections, factionalism was publicly revealed on several occasions among the leaders of Haryana Congress before the assembly elections
 purv mukhyamantri bhupendra singh hooda or purv congress pradesh adhyaksh ashok tanvar ke bich chhattis kaa aankada rahaa he
 Because of this, the Congress high command was facing a lot of trouble
 aise main congress kii rashtriya adhyaksh sonia gandhi kii kareebi maani jane vaali kumari shailaja ko haryana congress kaa adhyaksh banaaya gaya
 Kumari Selja had three challenges after becoming the President of Haryana Congress

 How did the Hooda and Shailaja pair raise seats? Haryana has about 30 per cent Jat population

 At the same time, there are about 19 percent Dalit voters in the state
 haryana main congress ke purv adhyaksh ashok tanvar kii daliton ke bich khaasi paith thi, lekin unke jane se dalit samudaay kaa vot tuutane kii ashanka thi
 But Kumari Selja, coming from the same community, helped to bring back the Dalit community voters back to the party
 rajya kii 90 siton main se 55 siton par 40 fisadi voter jat samudaay se aate hai
 Whereas, out of 71 seats, 30 percent seats have more Dalit voters
 aise main chunaav prabandhan samiti ke adhyaksh bhupendra singh hooda or kumari shailaja kii jodi ne in donon samudaayon ke voters ko apni ore khinchne kaa kaam kiya
 The party did not suffer the loss of Ashok Tanwar
 jabaki, tanvar ne party se istipha dete hue bina kisi kaa naam liye kaha tha ki congress main acchhee tarah se apni jade jamaaye baithe kuch logon ko lagata he ki ve bhagwaan hai lekin logon ko nasht karne ke liye ve rakshason kii tarah vyavhaar kar rahe hai

 The managing director of the company said that i am trying to threaten him and called me a terrorist
 mujhe meri hi sarajameen par aatankwaadi kaha gaya yah bahut sharmnaak he
 After this, Ismail conveyed this to the Human Rights Commission, Minority Commission and even the Chief Minister's Office but no action was taken

 Vinod Kumar Binny, an MLA from Laxminagar in Delhi, has opened a front against the party

 Binny is openly saying that Kejriwal's government is withdrawing from its earlier promises and cheating the people
 binni ke tikhe tevar kaa andaja aap isi baat se laga sakate hai ki unhone kejariwal ke khilaaf anshan karne kii dhamkee tak di he
 According to Binny, all the decisions of the Aam Aadmi Party are taken by a few people in closed rooms and more importance is being given to the newly inducted people in the party
 binni ne sawaal uthaaya he ki 'aap' ne jin vaadon ko chunaav se pehle kiya tha unhone kyon nahin puraa kiya ja rahaa he
 Why is there difference between Kejriwal's words and actions

 We are concerned about the welfare of the people
 yadi ve (aap) logon ke muddon se hatate hai to main jitani baar bhi jarurat hogi, virodh karuunga

 is samay desh main raajnneeti or cricket kii sabase dilachasp jang jari he
 The most interesting thing about this fight is that people all over the country take an interest in the day-to-day war, court hearing more than the one who won this war
 sabko maaloom he ki is ladaai se desh kii raajnneeti par koi asar pade yaa nahin lekin centre sarkaar kii mushkilen jarur bad gai hai or vah hona lajimi he
 When your party mps are making allegations and the Union Finance Minister himself has to go to court and file a defamation case, it is natural to affect the government's key
 kendriya vitt mantri arun jetali or bijepi se ab nilambit darbhanga ke saansad kirti aaazaad ke bich hameshaa se chhattis kaa aankada rahaa he
 Bihar's politics has been more responsible for this than Delhi's cricket
 cricket ke maidan main yah kisi se chipa nahin ki jaise-jaise arun jetali kaa prabhaav badha usee anupaat main kirti aaazaad haashiye par bhi gaye or kirti aaazaad kii naaraazgi kaa kaaran maatr cricket nahin bihar kii raajnneeti bhi he
 Although the pitch of Kotla should normally have nothing to do with the political arena of Bihar, the ongoing battle between Jaitley and Keerthi continued to play a parallel game
 kabhi jetali jite to kabhi kirti ne unki nahin chalane di
 But what was the fight like, it is important to understand it
 darasal kirti aaazaad pehali baar 1999 main bihar ke darbhanga se bijepi ke tikat par saansad bane
 He organized a cricket camp for the local children of his parliamentary constituency Darbhanga and took Lalu Yadav, then president of the Rashtriya Janata Dal, at the conclusion
 isse bijepi ke netaaon main badi naaraazgi rahi
 In later days, when he was an MP, he also became the selector of the national team, but for some reason after a period in 2004 he was neither a parliament nor a selector
 chayan samiti se hataae jane ke peeche kirti kaa maananaa tha ki jetali ne unhen apane prabhaav kaa istemaal kar hataaya he
 Subsequently, in 2005, Bihar assembly elections were held twice and neither of the supporters of Kirti got a ticket nor was the party considered worth campaigning
 aap ise ek sanyog kah sakate hai ki us jamaane main arun jetali bihar chunaav ke bijepi prabharee hote the
 At one point, Kirti even campaigned with a motorcycle to keep herself relevant
 party ne unhen na to kabhi saadhan muhaiyaa karaayaa or na hi kshetra main kahin jane ke liye kaha
 Later, Nitish Kumar's government was formed and Sanjay Jha entered Darbhanga politics
 sanjay jha ek jamaane main rajeev pratap rudi ke liye media kaa kaam dekhte the
 In later days, Sanjay Jha was also close to Nitish Kumar due to his relationship with Jaitley and it is believed that Arun Jaitley was grooming him as an alternative against Kirti Azad
 isamen nitish kumaar kii maun sahmati bhi thi
 But Arun Jaitley parted ways with the parliamentary board meeting just before the list of Bihar was discussed when Sudhanshu Mittal was made co-incharge of Assam in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections when the ticket was being distributed
 iskaa phayda sidhe kirti ko mila
 He managed to get tickets with the support of Rajnath, Sushma and Advani
 phir ve chunaav bhi jite lekin unka hameshaa dard yahi rahaa ki saansad bhale ve hon lekin prashasan main chalati sanjay jha kii he, jinke upar arun jetali or nitish kumaar kaa haath he
 Perhaps this is the reason that you must have seen in the Delhi Cricket Association meeting that you are targeting Kirti Jaitley, in the same way, he once lashed out against Nitish Kumar in a review meeting
 nitish ne uske baad kirti ko apane paas fatakane nahin diya
 The comments san 2014 main kirti phir modi lahar main saansad chune gaye
 It was also a coincidence that Sanjay Jha was also on the Janata Dal United ticket against him but he could not even save the bail
 lekin raajnneeti ke maidan main bhale kirti jetali ko maat dete ja rahe hon lekin dilli cricket main unki puch dinondin kam hoti ja rahi thi
 It was always up to Kirti and in the meantime he got the papers of the stadium construction
 jetali ke khilaaf agar kirti ne morcha kholaa to unhen pratyaksh yaa apratyaksh rup se party ke kai netaaon kaa samarthan hasil tha
 It was a section of the leaders who believed that Jaitley was somewhere responsible for his current political situation
 nishchit rup se aane vaale dinon main yah ladaai or tej hogi, lekin kuch baaten spasht hai ki bihar se kirti ko raajnneetik boria-bistar samet janaa padegaa, kyonki bihar bijepi main jin netaaon kii chalati he unke saath unka chhattis kaa aankada rahaa hai
 As much as Kirti will speak, he will continue to increase the difficulties for BJP and Arun Jaitley, which Lalu, Nitish and Congress leaders would like to enjoy right now

 haalanki kotla kii pich kaa amuman bihar kii raajnneeti ke maidan se koi lenaa-dena nahin hona chahie, lekin jetali or kirti ke bich jari jang main donon jagah samanaantar sah-maat kaa khel chalata rahaa
 Sometimes Jaitley won and sometimes Kirti did not let him run
 lekin ladaai aakhir thi kya, ise samajhnaa jaruri he
 In fact, Kirti Azad first became MP on BJP ticket from Darbhanga in Bihar in 1999
 unhone apane sansadeey kshetra darbhanga ke sthaneey bacchon ke liye ek cricket camp kaa aayojan kiya or uske samaapan main us samay rashtriya janata dal ke adhyaksh lalu yadav ko le gaye
 This caused a lot of resentment among the BJP leaders
 baad ke dinon main jab ve saansad the tabhi rashtriya team ke chayankarta bhi bane lekin kisi kaaran se ek turm ke baad 2004 main na ve sansad rahe or na hi chayankarta
 Kirti believed that Jaitley used his influence to remove him from the selection committee
 iske baad 2005 main bihar main do baar vidhansabha chunaav hue or donon baar kirti ke ek bhi samarthak ko na to tikat mila or na hi unhen party ne prachaar laayak samajha gaya
 You can call it a coincidence that at that time, Arun Jaitley used to be BJP in-charge of Bihar elections
 ek samay naubat yahaan tak aa gai ki kirti ne apane aapako praasangik banaae rakhane ke liye motorcycle se prachaar kiya
 The party neither provided him any means nor asked him to go anywhere in the region
 baad ke dinon main nitish kumaar kii sarkaar bani or darbhanga kii raajnneeti main sanjay jha kaa pravesh hua
 Sanjay Jha once used to work in media for Rajiv Pratap Rudy
 baad ke dinon main jetali ke saath apane sambandhon ke kaaran sanjay jha nitish kumaar ke bhi najadik hue or yah mana jaataa he ki arun jetali, kirti aaazaad ke khilaaf unhen vikalp ke rup main taiyaar kar rahe the
 Nitish Kumar's silent consent was also in this
 lekin 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav main jab tikat kaa bantwaaraa ho rahaa tha us samay sudhanshu mittal ko assam kaa sah prabharee banaae jane par arun jetali bihar kii list par charchaa hone ke thik pehle party se ruuthakar sansadeey board kii baithak se alag ho gaye
 Kirti directly benefited from this
 vah rajnath, sushamaa or adwani ke samarthan se tikat lene main safal ho gaye
 Then he also won the elections but his pain was always that the mps may be but Sanjay Jha, who is in the administration, has Arun Jaitley and Nitish Kumar on hand
 shaayad yahi kaaran rahaa ki jis tareeke se dilli cricket association kii baithak main aapane dekha hoga kirti jetali ko nishaanaa bana rahe hai usee tareeke se unhone ek baar samiksha baithak main nitish kumaar ke khilaaf bhi jamkar bolaa tha
 Nitish does not let Kirti get caught near him after that
 tippaniyan In 2014, Kirti was again elected as an MP in the Modi wave
 yah bhi sanyog rahaa ki janata dal united ke tikat par sanjay jha bhi unke khilaaf maidan main the lekin ve jamaanat bhi nahin bachaa paae
 But in the field of politics, Kirti may be beating Jaitley, but in Delhi cricket, his question was becoming less and more frequent
 iskaa malaal kirti ko hameshaa rahaa or is bich stadium nirmaan ke kagajaat unke haath lag gaye
 If Kirti opened a front against Jaitley, he had the support of many party leaders, directly or indirectly
 yah un netaaon kaa tabaka tha jo maanata tha ki unki vartmaan rajnatik sthiti ke liye jetali kahin na kahin jimmedaar hai
 Certainly this fight will intensify in the coming days, but it is clear that Kirti will have to go from Bihar with political baggage, because she has a figure of thirty-six with the leaders who run in Bihar BJP
 kirti jitna bolenge utani mushkilen ve bijepi or arun jetali ke liye badhaate rahenge jiskaa majaa lalu , nitish or congress ke netaa philhal uthaanaa chahenge

 But Arun Jaitley parted ways with the parliamentary board meeting just before the list of Bihar was discussed when Sudhanshu Mittal was made co-incharge of Assam in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections when the ticket was being distributed
 iskaa phayda sidhe kirti ko mila
 He managed to get tickets with the support of Rajnath, Sushma and Advani
 phir ve chunaav bhi jite lekin unka hameshaa dard yahi rahaa ki saansad bhale ve hon lekin prashasan main chalati sanjay jha kii he, jinke upar arun jetali or nitish kumaar kaa haath he
 Perhaps this is the reason that you must have seen in the Delhi Cricket Association meeting that you are targeting Kirti Jaitley, in the same way, he once lashed out against Nitish Kumar in a review meeting
 nitish ne uske baad kirti ko apane paas fatakane nahin diya
 The comments san 2014 main kirti phir modi lahar main saansad chune gaye
 It was also a coincidence that Sanjay Jha was also on the Janata Dal United ticket against him but he could not even save the bail
 lekin raajnneeti ke maidan main bhale kirti jetali ko maat dete ja rahe hon lekin dilli cricket main unki puch dinondin kam hoti ja rahi thi
 It was always up to Kirti and in the meantime he got the papers of the stadium construction
 jetali ke khilaaf agar kirti ne morcha kholaa to unhen pratyaksh yaa apratyaksh rup se party ke kai netaaon kaa samarthan hasil tha
 It was a section of the leaders who believed that Jaitley was somewhere responsible for his current political situation
 nishchit rup se aane vaale dinon main yah ladaai or tej hogi, lekin kuch baaten spasht hai ki bihar se kirti ko raajnneetik boria-bistar samet janaa padegaa, kyonki bihar bijepi main jin netaaon kii chalati he unke saath unka chhattis kaa aankada rahaa hai
 As much as Kirti will speak, he will continue to increase the difficulties for BJP and Arun Jaitley, which Lalu, Nitish and Congress leaders would like to enjoy right now

 ) punjab neshnal bank ghotaale kaa aaropee or bhagoda hira kaarobaari mehul chokasee ke pratyrpan ko lekar bharat kii taraf se antigua sarkaar ko aupchaarik nivedan kiya gaya he
 At the same time, the Antigua administration's shocking claim that Choksi was granted citizenship of Antigua based on the impeccable report received by India
 mumbai police ke ek varisht adhikari ke mutabik malabar hills police stesan ne chokasee ko lekar clin chit (bedaag report) di he
 Let us know that Choksi left India and went to Dubai a few days before the CBI registered a case against Mehul Choksi and Nirav Modi in the 13,000 crore PNB scam
 chokasee ne kshetreey passport karyaalay main police satyaapan ke liye 23 farvari 2017 ko aavedan diya tha
 Regarding which, on 15 March 2017, an immaculate report was given by the Malabar Hills Police Station
 mana ja rahaa he ki isi report ke aadhaar par mehul chokasee ne antigua kii naagarikta hasil kii
 It is astonishing that on what basis the mehul choksi, which had several cases registered in 2017, was given a flawless report and Mumbai Police ignored these cases before giving the report
 haalanki maujuuda vyavastha kaa bhi isamen utana hi dosha he
 According to the police, the spotless report was given to Choksi because no criminal background or evidence of arrest was found against him
 bataa den ki is tarah kii clearence mumbai police kii online aapraadhik prishthbhumi or soochna pranali (sieaies) dwaara jaanch karne ke baad di jaati he
 If a person is arrested in the past, he comes to CAIS
 14 march, ko mumbai police kii special branch ne kshetreey passport karyaalay, mumbai ko yah report saunpi
 Antigua claims that Choksi applied for citizenship in May 2017 and this citizenship was granted on the basis of an impeccable report from the Regional Passport Office under the Ministry of External Affairs of India
 haalankimumbai police ne chokasee ko police satyaapan report jarihone ke maamle main jaanch kaa aadesh de diya he
 But it is not clear whether the clearance was given to Mehul Choksi under the influence of someone or whether it was due to a flaw in the old system
 mumbai police kii ore se jari vijyapti main kaha gaya he ki kshetreey passport karyaalay ne chokasee ko 2015 main 'police satyaapan jaruri nahin' kaa darja pradaan kiya tha or iske baad pienbi ghotaale main ab mukhya aaropee chokasee ne tatkaal shrenee main passport hasil kiya tha

 First, let the BJP follow the path of truth and then talk: Development will happen only by following the path of Priyanka Gandhi Gandhi: On Akhilesh Gandhi Jayanti, the Congress took a padyatra in many cities in which Priyanka Gandhi, the General Secretary of the party, led the padyatra in Lucknow
 is padayatra ke baad priyanka gandhi ne kaha ki pehle logon ko mahatma gandhi ke dikhaae satya ke maarg par chalanaa chahie phir unke bare main baat kerani chahie
 Before taking a padyatra silently on Gandhiji's 150th birth anniversary, Priyanka Gandhi said that walking in the path of truth was Gandhiji's order
 bijepi pehle unke aadarshon par chale phir unke bare main baat kare
 Prior to joining the padayatra, Priyanka said that women are being tortured and when they raise voice to fight against her, they are crushed
 ham nishchit rup se iske khilaaf sangharsh karenge
 The Congress, led by Priyanka Gandhi, took out the Gandhi Sandesh Yatra martyr's memorial to the Gandhi statue at GPO
 ab vah waapas dilli laut rahi hai
 It is good that everyone should follow the path of Gandhiji: After paying tribute to the Gandhi statue of Akhilesh Lucknow, Akhilesh Yadav said that the country will develop only by following the path built by Gandhi
 vipaksh ke sadan ke 36 ghante ke vishesh satr ke bahishkaar par akhilesh bole ki bijepi vichaardhaara ke log kabhi gandhiji ke raste par nahin chale
 a party whose people rely on violence is celebrating Gandhi Jayanti
 isliye sapa is paksh main nahin he, ye aaj keval gandhiji, lohia, vivekanand ko apnaanaa chaahate hai
 He further said that it is only a matter of adoption, the intention behind that is of his works
 yogi adityanath or bijepi ne upi ko neeche se number ek par laane kaa kaam kiya he
 On Congress President General Priyanka Gandhi's padyatra, Akhilesh Yadav said that it is good that everyone should follow the path of Mahatma Gandhi and put his ideals in his political agenda
 'chunaav ayog nishpaksh hoga to sapa jeetegi'upi main hone vaale upachunaav par purv mukhyamantri ne kaha ki chunaav ayog jis din nishpaksh ho jayega, samaajawaadee party (sapa) jeetne lagegi
 In Rampur, officers have been employed to win elections
 dilli main congress kii padayatra ke samaapan par sonia gandhi ne buudhvaar ko party kaaryakartaaon ko sambodhit karte hue kaha ki bharat kii buniyaad main hi gandhi ke siddhant hai
 The Congress always followed the principles of Gandhiji, those who want complete power could never understand Gandhi
 gandhiji prem ke liye khadey rahe, nafrat ke liye nahin
 Those with the politics of lies cannot understand Gandhi
 dilli vidhansabha chunaav kareeb he or tamaam partiyaan votaron ko lubhaane ke tareeke talash rahi hai lekin is baar dilli main sarkaar kiski banegi, isamen fasebuk yugers kii bhoomika bhi ahm ho sakati he
 According to statistics, in most of the assembly seats of Delhi, Facebook users are so large that they can decide the defeat and victory of any candidate
 dilli main kareeb 1 karod 10 lakh voter hai
 In the 2008 elections, 58 per cent, or about 61 lakh people exercised their right to vote
 congress ne chunaav main jeet hasil kii or party ko kareeb 25 lakh vot mili lekin dilli main kitne log fasebuk kaa istemaal kar rahe hai ye jaanakar aap hairaan rah jaaenge
 The number of Facebook users in Delhi is more than the total votes the Congress party won in the last assembly elections
 dilli main kareeb 43 lakh fasebuk yugers hai or 18 saal se upar ke fasebuk yugers kii taadaad kareeb 38 lakh hai, yani dilli kii satta tak pahunchane ke liye jitne vot chahiyein usase zyada log fasebuk istemaal kar rahe hai
 If this figure is divided into assembly seats, then there are about 54 thousand Facebook users in every assembly constituency
 pichley vidhansabha chunaav main keval do hi siten aisi thi jahaan jeetne vaale ummidavaar ko 54 hajaar se zyada vot hasil hue the
 This means that there are more Facebook users than the number of votes required to win 68 Assembly seats in Delhi
 aane vaale vidhansabha chunaavon main soshal netwarking site fasebuk kaa kitna asar hone vaala he ye aankadon kii nazar se saaf dikhaai de rahaa he
 Even the politicians of Delhi are understanding this matter very much
 pradesh bijepi ke adhyaksh vijay goyal hon yaa congressi diggaj mukesh sharma
 Everyone is trying to make their presence known on social networking
 is trend ko samajhakar sabase pehle fasebuk kaa istemaal karne vaale dilli ke netaaon main se ek hai bijepi netaa harshavardhan
 Dr
 harshavardhan ke fasebuk par paanch hazaar se zyada folors hai or fasebuk folors kii sankhya ke lihaaj se wo maujuuda bijepi pradesh adhyaksh vijay goyal se bhi aage hai
 Vijay Goel has around 3000 Facebook followers
 purv bijepi pradesh adhyaksh vijendra gupta ke fasebuk par kareeb 3200 folors hai
 Congress's strongman Mukesh Sharma is also a favorite of about 5000 people on Facebook
 congress ke yuva vidhayak choudhary anil kumaar bhi logon se judane ke liye fasebuk kaa bakhubi istemaal kar rahe hai
 About 5000 names are also listed in their list of Facebook friends
 dilli kii nayi party fasebuk ke is naye funda ko khub samaj rahi he or aam aadmi party ke sanyojak fasebuk folors ke maamle main sabase aage hai
 Kejriwal has around 8500 followers and has about 28 xxrep 4 0 page likes
 aam aadmi party ke duusare netaa manish sitaudiya ke bhi kareeb 5000 fasebuk friend hai
 That is, the leaders of every party are using Facebook to make contact with the voters, but the question is whether the Facebook followers will actually be converted into votes
 desh, duniya, mahanagar, khel, aarthik or bollywood main kya kuch hua

 baba barphani ho gaye hai antardhyaan
 Has Baba Barfani got angry with devotees? This is being said because Baba Barfani has disappeared before the completion of the Amarnath Yatra
 pavitra gupha main jis shivlinga kaa aakaar kai feet kaa hua karata tha, ab wo puri tarah pigal chukaa hai 
 Now, the devotees going on Amarnath Yatra will only have a glimpse of the holy cave, and not of the naturally built Shivalinga
 har-har mahadev ke jaighosh ke saath bade hi ullas ke saath shuru hui thi amarnath yatra
 But 18 days after the start of the journey, Baba Barfani started to become impolite
 14 feet kaa shivlinga pighalkar pehle hi rahasyamayi tareeke se chota ho gaya
 Let us tell you that these photos are from 13th July
 jabaki 14 july ko baba barphani kaa aakaar mahaj kuch inch kaa rah gaya
 According to beliefs, Amarnath is the abode of Sakshata Shiva and Parvati, saying that it is only due to the presence of Shiva and Shakti that Mahadev appears here every year to offer prayers to millions of devotees in the idol of snow
 barf kii isi pavitra murti ko shivlinga kaha jaataa he
 Till now, Mahadev used to be imparted by giving prayers to the devotees for 55 days, but now, like Kedarnath, Amarnath has turned his face to the devotees
 vaise is baar yatra shuru hone ke pehle se hi baba barphani apane bhakton se ruthe hai
 Baba Barfani was 16 feet in size on 14 May
 maheene bhar main ye ghatakar 9 feet rah gaya or ab ye mahaj kunch inch kaa rah gaya he
 Baba Barfani will be disappointed by the devotees who are coming for the journey
 baba barphani kii yatra 28 june ko puure josh or utsaah ke saath shuru hui thi
 Millions of devotees went out to see Baba Barfani
 lekin do hafton main hi amarnath gupha ko chhod gayi mahadev
 While the Amarnath Yatra will continue till August 21, the devotees are surprised as to how they will celebrate Rothe Nath in the holy cave
 28 june se amarnath kii yatra shuru hui, abhi tak kareeb dhai lakh bhakt barphani baba ke darshan kar chuke hai
 While three and a half lakh devotees can reach Amarnath, thousands of devotees are visiting Baba Barfani in the holy cave every day, but for the first time, the devotees are feeling the displeasure of Mahadev in the holy cave, the devotees returned after seeing that Mahadev's Being angry is their anger
 koi pehali baar amarnath kii yatra par aayaa he, to koi kai baar aa chukaa he, baba barphani ke antardhyaan hone kii khabar se bhakt behad dukhi hai, unhen ab amarnath gupha main us shiv ling ke darshan nahin ho paayenge jis ke liye wo itani kathin yatra karke pahunchate hamemarnath yatra par jane kii ichha ek baar har shiv bhakt ke man main hoti he, kyonki amarnath kii pavitra gupha main virajman mahadev kaa swaroop kisi chamatkaar se kam nahin
 This form of Barfani Baba not only makes nature on its own, but in the meantime, Mahadev Mahadev comes and resides in it
 kaha jaataa he ki gupha main maujuud shivlinga ke upar boond boond jal tapakataa he
 This Shivling is formed by the freezing of the same water, it is believed that this water drips from Ramkund, which is just above the cave
 manyata ke mutabik poornima kii raat ko shivlinga apane puure aakaar main hota he or poornima ke baad jaise-jaise chand kaa aakaar ghatata jaataa he, vaise-vaise shivlinga kaa aakaar bhi ghatata jaataa he
 But Bhole Bhandari in Amarnath got so angry that Mahadev had already disappeared due to the heat falling on the mountains
 mausam vibhaag bhi maanata he ki shivlinga ke pighalane ke peeche achaanak badi garmi he
 People associated with religion believe that the sudden warming of the season is the anger of Mahadev
 pehle yatra shuru hote vakt barish ne bhakton ko roka tha or ab khud mahadev pavitra gupha chhod gayi, jiskaa malatab he ki abhi nath kii naaraazgi dur nahin hui he
 After all, why Bhole Bhandari got absorbed in the holy cave of Amarnath
 kyon kareeb do hafton main pigal gaya shivlinga
 This is a big question for those who believe in religion
 lekin vaigyanikon kii maane to is saal amarnath main pichley saalon ke mukaable zyada garmi padi, jisaki vajah se barf kaa shivlinga pigal gaya
 The path leading to the Amarnath cave of faith is dry and flat
 amuman is vakt jin raaston par barf hi barf dikhaai padati he, vahaan barf kaa namonishaan nahin he
 Water is coming out of the pipe in the Amarnath cave
 amarnath gupha main is vakt pani bahane kaa sawaal hi nahin uthta kyonki is samay barf hi barf hoti he
 The temperature in the valley has reached 37 degrees this year
 baari bheed kii vajah se amarnath gupha ke aasapaas kaa taapmaana or bahut bad gaya
 However, the Shrine Board claimed that in the last two-three years they have taken some measures that do not raise the cave temperature
 2013 main 16 feet se baba barphani 9 kii rah gaye, isse pehle 2012 main shivlinga kaa aakaar 22 feet se ghatakar 14 feet gaya tha
 In 2011, 16 feet of Baba Barfani was seen which melted to 4 feet in just 5 days
 or saal 2010 main 12feet ke shivlinga kaa aakaar pighalkar pehle 6 feet hua or baad main 3 feet ho gaya or ek maheene kii yatra khatm hote hote baba barphani puri tarah antardhan ho gaye
 In every pilgrimage place, the devotees are disillusioned with Kedarnath, Kailash Mansarovar and Amarnath, Mahadev, in such a way that the devotees are feeling despondent at every pilgrimage place
 pehle jalpralay se mahadev ne kedaar chhod diya, phir kharaab mausam ke chalate kailash maansarovar yatra rokani padaa or ab amarnath kii pavitra gupha main mahadev antardhyaan ho gayi
 Religious experts believe that since the deluge of Devbhoomi, Nath is angry
 nath ne apni teesri aankh kholkar utraakhand ko tabah kar diya, chaaron dham kii yatra ruki hui he, lekin ab amarnath main bhagwaan shiv kii antardhyaan hone se saaf he ki nath kii naaraazgi abhi dur nahin hui he
 But even the deluge in Kedar could not destroy the faith of the devotees
 bhakton ko laga amarnath main bhole bhandari ko manaa lenge
 In spite of all the difficulties, the devotion of devotion rose in Amarnath

 kai rajyon main jari chunaav abhiyaanon ne ek baar phir hamaare desh main satta or nijee suraksha ke visheshadhikaar ke sambandhon ko centre main laa diya he
 i am told that due to being close to the national capital, all the leaders who are coming down with security frills in Uttar Pradesh are creating maximum impact of the force due to their bodyguards
 isamen rajya ke netaaon kaa suraksha tamzam to apni jagah he hi
 11 January 2012: See India Today in pictures It will be interesting to find the sources of development of private security in India
 ek samay tha jab pradhanmantri sahit kisi kaa bhi itane tamzam vaala suraksha intjaam nahin hota tha
 i remember an incident from the early '80s
 meri saas ham logon ke paas dilli ai thim
 i took a day off to visit them
 main car chalaakar south block pahunchaa or pradhanmantri karyaalay ke pravesh dwaar par car khadi kar koi jaruri kaam nibatane andar chalaa gaya
 My wife and mother-in-law were sitting in the car
 jab main waapas lautaa to meri saas bhavvibhor thim-pradhanmantri indira gandhi lunch ke liye ghar jate hue hamaari car kii bagal se gujri thim
 04 January 2012: See in pictures India Today Today it is almost impossible to imagine a car parked anywhere near the entrance of the Prime Minister's Office
 jaisaa ham sabhi jaanate hai, indira gandhi kii hatya kii ghatana ne bharat ke suraksha paridrishy ko hameshaa ke liye badal diya
 The assassination of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in an election campaign seven years later is in many ways responsible for the over-defensive security arrangements of candidates and campaigners during the election today
 28 disambar 2011: tasveeron main dekhen india todamgar uske bahut pehle se hi suraksha ke liye paatrata na sirf netaaon main balki adhikariyon ke bich bhi states simbel ban gai thi
 When initial discussions on the classification of security were underway, the then Director of Intelligence Bureau M
 ke
 Narayanan came up with the innovative idea of keeping the security risk gradation in reverse order
 sabase ucch shrenee kaa naam 'e' rakhe jane ke saamaanya vyavhaar ke vipareet sabase adhik jokhim vaali shrenee kaa namakaran unhone 'jed' kiya
 It was expected that adhering to this classification would minimize demand for higher security based on arrogance and status
 baharhaal, suraksha kii chaah rakhane vaale varg ko is tikadam main zyada din tak nahin fansa ja sakaa
 Once the 'raj' was exposed, everyone began to seek the highest, not 'Z' but 'Z Plus' category security system
 21 disambar 2011: tasveeron main dekhen india todeindira gandhi kii hatya ke baad pradhanmantri kii suraksha ke liye sthapit special protection group (espiji) ke gathan ke dauraan kaaphi vichaar-vimarsh chalaa
 Its first director, Drs
 es
 Subramaniam was a man of emphasis on law and order
 unhone rajeev gandhi se spasht kah diya tha ki pradhanmantri kii suraksha se sambandhit maamalon main, pradhanmantri kii nahin balki espiji ke nideshak kii chalegi
 The young officers elected from various central police organizations and IPS were smart and better educated-trained for the security cover closest to the Prime Minister

 14 December 2011: See in pictures India Today Election Commission has worked very hard to organize things
 suraksha daste ke vaahanon ke upyog ke sambandh main disha-nirdesh bahut spasht hai
 The minister or any political officer is not allowed to use the pilot car during the election even if the state administration has provided him with a security cover in the presence of armed bodyguards
 chunaav kii nigaraanee main doordaraj ke rajyon se vibhinn sevaaon ke adhikari jutaaye jate hai taaki koi pakshpaat na ho
 Similarly, in remote states where elections are being held, the police force is sent from one end of India to the other to strengthen checkpoints and maintain law and order

 07 December 2011: See India Today in pictures jab google ke hyderabad karyaalay main kaam kar chuke ek 30 varshiya ejeeniyar munavad salmaan ko pichley saal aktubar main shahar ke hawaii adde se giraftaar kiya gaya, tab police kaa daawa tha ki vah saudi arab ja rahaa tha
 From there, he planned to go to Iraq and join the Jihadi terrorist group Islamic State of Iran and Syria (ISIS)
 baad main salmaan ko chhod diya gaya
 He had allegedly read ISIS promotional material on the internet for several months and made up his mind to go there
 yaheen par kahani nayaa mode le leti he
 Many online chat and dialogue sessions of this type were actually taking place with intelligence personnel who are setting their nets on the net to scan youths like Salman
 unki talash main vaise yuva the jinhen aatanki samoohon main laane ke liye online diksha di ja rahi he
 This is the latest counter intelligence program of Indian intelligence agencies named 'operation Chakravyuh'
 abhi yah vichaar vikaas ke charan main he lekin yah ek aisi ranneeti he jiskaa vakt aa chukaa he
 Regarding Operation Chakravyuh, a member of a counter intelligence agency told India Today, "officers open their accounts with the identity of jihadist groups and try to lure youngsters on Facebook, Yahoo or other chat forums who are online terrorists Be impressed with promotional material
 shuruaati baatcheet ke baad jinke bare main yah pataa lagata he ki ve jihad karne main dilchaspee rakhte hai, unhen alag chat room main le jaaya jaataa he yaa phir email ke jariye rabta kaayam karne ke liye kaha jaataa he
 The intelligence officer said that Salman came to his grip when the agencies started a chat room with a photo of ISIS chief Abu Bakr al Baghdadi and claimed to be affiliated with this jihadi group, whose job is to recruit aspiring candidates
 
 ek baar jab aise logon kii spasht shinaakht ho jaati he, phir unki asli pahchaan, vivaran aadi pataa karne or un par nigaah rakhane kaa kaam bachataa he
 Salman was caught just like this
 isi tareeke se pichley chah maah main kareeb 120 yuvaaon kii pahchaan kii gai he jo iageies main jane ke icchhuk the
 At present, the agencies have just kept their watch on them due to themselves being unable to take action
 pichley saal disambar main giraftaar kiye gaye bangaluru ke ejeeniyar mehadi masaroor biswas jaise iageies ke samarthakon kii ore se twitor ke durupyog ne bahut se logon ke liye ‘online aatank prashikshan’ naam ke ek pitare ko khol diya he
 But the Ministry of Home Affairs, while exercising restraint on such matters, has decided to deal with it in another way
 aatanki samoohon kii ore se yuvaaon ke online prashikshan par nigaraanee rakhane or unhen pahchaanane ke liye chalaae gaye oparation chakravyuuh ke agle charan ke taur par mantralay ke aantarik suraksha vibhaag ko ek rashtriya kaarykram taiyaar karne ko kaha gaya he
 His primary thrust will be to deal with jihadi propaganda material on the Internet
 pichley saal november main police mahanideshkon ke salanaa sammelan main guwahati main is vichaar ko vistaar se prastut kiya gaya tha
 There the Intelligence Bureau elaborated on the need for counter-radicalization and de-radicalization programs
 police pramukh is baat se sahamat the ki sibar spes par nigaraanee rakhane main zyada kshamta viksit karne kii jarurat he
 And for this a reverse publicity material should be prepared and publicized on the internet to prevent the youth from getting caught in the clutches of the terrorists
 pehle bhi aise prayaas kiye gaye hai
 An attempt to monitor online jihad was foiled because it was caught in a bureaucratic web between the National Technical Research Organization (NTRO), IB and the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW)
 ye teenon agenciyaan rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar ke maatahat hoti hai
 Officials said that hence the plan is being made now that such centers will be set up inside the jails where experts will conduct psychological analysis and evaluation of Dixit fanatics
 guptchar agenciyon kii ek dikkat yah he ki jokhim uthaane or kisi jihadi ko badaae dene ke bich kii vibhaajak rekha bahut patali he
 Karanal Singh, the former head of the Special Cell of the Delhi Police, who exposed the first module of the Indian Mujahideen, says, "we don't know to what extent the involved people have gone or are willing to go
" isliye aisi pahal (counter or di-radicalijeshan) bhavishya main jaanchakartaaon ke liye ek aujaar ban sakati he
 Criticisms of this strategy also exist
 yahaan tak ki varisht ibi adhikariyon ke saath-saath guptchar agenciyon ke bheetar bhi kai logon kaa maananaa he ki aise kaaryakramon se alpsankhyak khud ko or zyada alag-thalag mahasoos kar sakate hai
 In addition, critics say that there is no flower-proof counter-radicalization program
 ve disambar main australia ke sidney bandhak cond ke aaropee main horin monis kaa hawala dete hai jo swayambhu prachaarak tha
 He was also part of an anti-radicalization initiative of this type in Australia

 Salman Khan caught in Arms Act case is going to reach Jodhpur court shortly
 vah mumbai sthit apane ghar gallexi apartment se ravaanaa ho chuke hai
 Salman will appear in Jodhpur court on Friday to confirm his bail sureties
 kya tha maamlasaal 1998 se salmaan khan ke khilaaf jodhpur main avaidh tareeke se hathiyaar rakhane or unase shikaar karne kaa maamla chal rahaa he
 Salman has been accused of hunting protected species of blackbuck and using non-licensed weapons during the shooting of 'hum Saath Saath Hain'
 haalanki trial court ne unhen janvari main is cese main bari kar diya tha
 The state government challenged the decision of acquitting Salman Khan, challenging the state government in the sessions court
 jiske baad rajya sarkaar kii yachika par court ne salmaan ko notice jari kiya
 An order has been issued to appear in the court to testify them
 iske liye unhen pichley maheene hi jodhpur aana tha lekin jaj kaa transfar ho jane kii vajah se cese kii sunwaayee tal gai thi
 5 black deer hunted During the shooting of the film 'hum Saath Saath Hain' in 1998, Salman Khan was accused of hunting black deer at 3 different places
 darasal jodhpur sthit bhavaad or kankaani gaanv main 4 kaale hiranon or ghoda farm main 1 kaale hiran kaa shikaar kiya gaya tha
 Non-licensee weapons were used in the hunt
 saf samet 4 filmi hastiyon par ye tha aaropis cese kii jaanch main saamne aayaa tha ki kankaani gaanv main jis vakt hiranon kaa shikaar hua, salmaan ke saath saf ali khan, sonaali bendre, tabboo or neelam bhi maujuud thim
 Salman is accused of hunting and provoking all three actresses including Saif
 'dabang khan' ko sunai 1 or 5 saal kii sajaais maamle main nichali adaalat ne salmaan ko 1 saal or 5 saal kii sajaa sunai thi
 Salman appealed against the verdict in the High Court
 jiske baad unhen donon hi maamalon main bari kar diya gaya
 Now this decision has been challenged by the state government in the Supreme Court
 kankaani gaanv main do kaale hiran ke shikaar maamle main nichali adaalat main sunwaayee jari he
 In the Arms Act case, a separate case was registered against Salman under the Arms Act because of the weapon used in the shooting
 darasal salmaan ne jin hathiyaaron se shikaar kiya tha, unki license date khatm ho chuki thi
 He was not renewed
