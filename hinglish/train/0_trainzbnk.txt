 ve pichley kuch hafton se afghanistan main taliban ke saath sidhe baatcheet kar rahe the
 The Taliban has agreed that Al Qaeda and the Islamic State will not use the Afghan territory for activities against the US and will provide reliable evidence to this effect
 iske badale america tayshuda samay main afghanistan se apane sainik bula lene ko raji ho gaya he
 The US also demands that there be a cease-fire between the Taliban and Afghan security forces and negotiate a political settlement with the Afghan government
 philhal in sharton par taliban netritv ke faisle kaa intjaar he
 The Taliban may agree on this additional agreement for two reasons
 pehla, prastaavit yudhviram taliban ke dabadabe vaale un jilon main uske maujuuda varchasv ko banaae rakhega
 The Afghan government controls only the main cities and major highways, but that too is in constant danger
 doosraa, ab america kii koi jid nahin he ki taliban duusare siyaasi dalon kii tarah chunaav main hissaa le or afgaan samvidhan ke tahat shashan main hissedari ke liye sahamat ho
 Khalilzad said that how the Taliban will be a part of that power system will depend on the interaction between the government and the Taliban
 afghanistan ke bade hisse or kai jilon par uskaa kabja he or vah shanti samjhaute main isaki keemat par in ilaakon, praanton or pramukh mantralayon par adhikaar maangega
 The Taliban have their own military power and also open support of Pakistan
 jaahir he, vah afghanistan se america or digar deshon ke sainikon kii vaapasi kaa istemaal apni takat or badhaane tathaa duusari siyaasi takaton ko darkinar karne main karegaa
 After the withdrawal of American peacekeepers, even if the Taliban violates the terms of the agreement, it is very unlikely that they will return to America
 bharat ke liye yah phir dushwariyon main funsane jaisi baat hogi
 Then there is a possibility of a Pakistani-dominated fundamentalist government in Kabul, our neighborhood, which will be a threat to Indian interests
 yah sab jald hone vaala he, so bharat ko ranneeti sheeghra banani hogi
 There is also an argument that India should open its own channel of dialogue with the Taliban because the Afghan nationalist Taliban will not support the Pakistani actions that harm India
 isaki sambhaavna kam hi he kyonki pakistan bharat ke 'khatre' ko dekhte hue hi har dasha main taliban ko paalataa-posta aa rahaa he
 Pakistan will implement its same old agenda as soon as the Taliban come into effective role in the Afghan system
 yahi ki afghanistan main bhartiya upasthiti ko kam karnaa or afgani jameen kaa bharat ke khilaaf aatankwaadi abhiyaanon ke liye istemaal karnaa
 And America is not worried about keeping its land safe
 chini or roosi apane hiton kii raksha ke liye pakistan ke saath achche rishton par bharosa karenge
 Iranians may feel a little worried about the coming of a radical Sunni regime in the neighborhood
 isi tarah uzbekistan, tajikistan, kirghigistan jaise kuch duusare madhya asian deshon ko bhi thodaa sirdard ho saktaa he
 Is there a scope for India to discuss a counter strategy with such concern countries? In the last decade and a half, India has become not only a major economic partner of Afghanistan but also many successful community and social welfare It has gained social goodwill and popularity due to the projects
 uske paas gaiyr-pakhtoon nordarn alliance ke bhagidaaron ke saath rajnatik sampark or prabhaavshaalee pakhtoon rajnatik hastiyon se talmail ke taur par ek behatar network he
 The return of the Taliban to the Afghan regime will not excite them because the power of the Taliban will make them marginalized
 taliban ke is kabje ko rokane ke liye bharat unako ekajute or vajandaar siyaasi takat banane main madad kar saktaa he?afghanistan main bichhi is bisaat par bharat kii chaalon ke liye vikalp kathin hai or sthiti kaaphi had tak asuvidhajanak he
 Sending troops in the name of supporting Afghanistan's government forces cannot be called a wise move but military support must definitely be increased at some stage
 ab mudde kii baat yahi he ki afghanistan par purna rup se talibani kabje ko roka jaae, bhale iske liye talibani maujuudagi vaali sarkaar ko bardaasht karnaa pade

 Earlier the emphasis was on the convenience of being corrupt in corruption, instead today it has come to business facility

 CII President Rakesh Bharti Mittal said, "the spirit of partnership and cooperative and competitive federalism between the Center and the states is yielding very good results to ease investment in the country
" ''is prishthbhumi main india today kaa rajyon kii dasha-disha adhyayan pehle se zyada praasangik or maujuun ho gaya he
 In its 17th year, this study has emerged as an overall and strong barometer of the functioning of the Indian states
 is saal hamane vibhinn shreniyon kii khaasiyaton main ijapha kar diya (dekhen adhyayan kaa tarika) or visheshgyon se salaah-mashvira karne ke baad harek shrenee kii alag-alag ahmiyat or bhaaransh tay kiya
 States were rated on a total of 2,000 points in various categories
 yahaan tak ki khaasiyaton kii bhi hamane alag-alag ahmiyat or bhaaransh tay kiya
 The reasoning behind this was simple — if different categories were given equal importance or weightage, certain states would often get an unfair advantage of their geographical and social factors
 masalan, maharashtra sareekha audyogic rajya yaa dilli paryaavaran ke maamle main himachal pradesh, kerala yaa assam ke mukaable kam ank hasil kar saktaa he
 Therefore, to neutralize any advantages of this variety, more importance and weight were given to those categories which reflect the state's own efforts
 kehane kaa yah matlab nahin ki paryaavaran duusari shreniyon ke mukaable jaraa bhi kam ahm he
 In fact, the functioning of states has become more important in India in terms of the environment, as the country stands at the very lowest position of the Global Environmental Performance Index (EPI) in Yale University's Environment Performance Index 2018
 2016 main desh 180 deshon kii fehrist main 141wein paaydaan par tha
 In 2018 it slipped to 177th position
 jab taaja hawa ke abhaav main rashtriya rajdhani dilli kaa dam phool rahaa he, kolkata sabase pradooshit rajdhaniyon main se ek ke taur par ubhar rahaa he or desh kii dusari sabase pradooshit nadiyaan assam main bah rahi hai, tab paryaavaran kii badahaali kuch nishchit shaharon, kshetron or ilaakon tak simit nahin rah gai he
 Unless political leadership and social awareness work side by side, development will have no meaning
 solah saal pehle jab india today ne hindustan ke amulchul badlaav main rajyon kii badhati bhoomika ko mana tha or unki growth kii rakrataar ko maapne kaa mahatvakankshi kaam shuru kiya tha, us vakt yojana ayog desh kii vruddhi kaa rodmap tay kiya karata tha
 States followed in the footsteps of the same schemes that the center built and decided
 aaj rajya apni takadir ke maalik khud hai yaa kam se kam us disha main bad to rahe hi hai
 The relationship between the center and the state is no longer that of the donor and the donor, but it is separated from it
 ab yah kaamkaaj par aadhaarit inaam kaa rishta he
 In fact, the NITI Aayog has advocated a formula for sharing of taxable taxes with the states for the central government, which is not against the interests of the states doing well on the social development parameters
 niti ayog ke upaadhyaksh rajeev kumaar ne haal hi main kaha, ''main samajhataa hum yah saaf he ki formula (rajyon ko karon ke bantwaare ke liye) aisa ho jisamen kaamkaaj aadhaarit kuch kasautiyaan bhi shaamil kii jaaen taaki un rajyon ko sajaa kaa bhaagi na bananaa pade jinhone kuch nishchit mandandon par behatar kaam kiya he
 "however, they warn that this cannot be done overnight and it will have to be implemented slowly, keeping in view the political sensitivity to resource sharing in the federal structure
" rajyon kii growth main gaiyr-barabari desh ke saamne maujuud sabase badi chunautiyon main se ek he
 This non-equal growth has given rise to many debates and grievances — North versus South, Coastal versus Mainland, Stable Government vs
 Frequent Changing Governments
 alabatta vikaas hameshaa do ke in jodon kii raah par nahin chalata, jaisaa ki india today ke rajyon kii dasha-disha adhyayan ne kai maukon par dikhaaya he
 For example, in the top 10 states across all categories — Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Gujarat, and Maharashtra — have shown a similar growth across regions
 nishchit taur par chintaa kii ek sanjeeda vajah bhi heru purab ke do bade rajya—pashchim bengal or odishah 12 main se kisi bhi shrenee main sheersh par nahin aa paae hai
 However, the most encouraging thing is the ranking of the states with the most improvement
 jo rajya paaramparik taur par "shreshth pradarshan karne vaale rajya'' kii shrenee main phiseddi rahe hai, unhone beete paanch saal main sabase tej vruddhi dikhaai he
 The top seven states with the most improvement: Assam, Jammu and Kashmir, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and Bihar — are at the bottom of the best-performing states
 aalochak beshak kahenge ki unki vruddhi dar isliye acchhee dikhaai detii he, kyonki unhone bahut nichle aadhaar se shuruyaat kii he
 But this cannot be turned away from the fact that these laggard states are trying vigorously and bravely to change their position
 yahi vajah he ki bihar or madhya pradesh sareekhe bimaaru rajya kareeb 10 fisadi kii vruddhi dar hasil kar rahe hai, jo aksar maharashtra or punjab sareekhe aarthik diggajon ke mukaable kahin zyada rahi he
 Like Puducherry, the state is growing at a rate of more than 10 percent
 fehrist main paaramparik taur par sabase upar rahane vaale rajyon ke liye nae ubharate rajyon kii vruddhi dar kii barabari kar paanaa mushkil ho gaya he
 That is why, out of the 31 states and union territories that were investigated for India Today's state direction, 27 get rewarded in many categories
 phir bhi yah mahaj shuruyaat he
 Apart from the non-equal neighborhood, where southern and western India have been the main engines of growth, while the north is gaining momentum, the east is still disappointing — the real gap is between urban and rural India
 hindustan ke jidipi main bhartiya shaharon kii hissedari takreeban 65 fisadi he
 There are also a few cities in better-performing states that are taking the growth forward
 gramin vikaas kii is kami kaa hi nateeja palaayan yaa pravaas kaa sankat he, jisaki sabase tazatreen misaal gujarat he
 According to the 2016–17 Economic Survey, which studies the pattern of migration or migration within the country, out-migration from “less affluent states” has been much higher, while the largest number of people from these states are in the most affluent states
 went
 lihaaj tamilnadu, karnataka or kerala sareekhe dakshin bhartiya rajyon ne pravaasiyon kii sabase zyada taadaad ko khinchaa he
 The rate of outward migration from Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh has increased
 aadhe se zyada pravasi in do rajyon se hi hai
 According to the Economic Survey 2016-17, by 2016, on an average nine million people went from one state to another every year for training or work in five years
 yah 2011 kii janaganana main darj 2001-2011 ke bich hue antar-rajya pravaasana se takreeban doguna he
 Interestingly, there has been a decrease in outward migration in Assam, perhaps reflecting the increasing opportunities in the state
 yah beete paanch saal main tamaam 12 shreniyon main apane pradarshan ke aadhaar par sabase sudhara hua bada rajya ban gaya he
 Last week, Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal from India Today claimed that private companies have given around one lakh jobs in the last two years
 sarkaar ne 55,000 logon ko kaam par rakhaa he
 Unfortunately, there have been frequent clashes against migrants in many states of India

 is baat kii sweekruti khud fasebuk ke siio mark ne di he
 When the US senators were bombarding the questions the other day, an MP asked them if your personal data was also leaked in the Cambridge Analytica case
 In response, Zuckerberg said "yes"
 is haa ke saath hi is tathy kii pushti unhone khud kii ki unka data bhi cambridge analitica ke paas pahunchaa he
 However, it is not clear from the answer now whether Zuckerberg himself downloaded the 'disordered digitallife' app, or with the help of some other friend, his data has been broken
 iske alaava bhi jakarberg jab poocha gaya ki kya fasebuk ke paas aisi takanic he jisase wo pataa laga sakate hai ki koi bahari takat ellection ko prabhavit karne kii koshish kar rahi he
 In response, Zuckerberg said that, since the 2016 election, the company has been continuously working on it so that it does not happen in the coming times and no external force like Russia can influence the election

 "at the same time, China reiterated that China is not withdrawing from its stand for entry in this group of non-npt countries
" china kaa kahana he ki bharat ke aavedan ke bare main sochane se pehle china ko non-enpiti deshon ke bare main ek saamaanya ravaiya apnaanaa hoga
 What is the objections of China: The NSG looks at the important issues related to nuclear and its 48 members are allowed to trade and export nuclear technology
 enesji sarvasammati ke siddhant ke tahat kaam karata he or bharat ke khilaaf ek desh kaa bhi vot bharat kii daavedaari ko nuksaan pahunchaa saktaa he
 China is opposing India's entry into the NSG
 uskaa kahana he ki bina parmaanu aprasar sandhi (enpiti) par hastakshar kiye kisi bhi desh kii is samooh main entry nahin ho sakati
 The NSG was formed in 1974 after India's first nuclear test
 iskaa lakshya tha ki duniya main bhar main parmaanu hathiyaaron ke prasar ko roka jaae
 Despite the efforts of the United States of America and Pakistan, the United States is trying to include India in this group

 Rimjhim showers continue in the capital city amidst cloudy movements
 mausam vibhaag kaa kahana he ki agle 48 ghanton yani 29 or 30 july ko dilli ensiaar ke tamaam ilaakon main 6 centimetre tak kii madhyam barish record kii jaaegi
 The reason behind the increase in rainfall is that the axis of the monsoon is shifted from south to north
 monsoon ke aksh ke dilli ke paas aate hi yahaan par barish main teji aa jaaegi or aasmaan main badalon kii awajahi kii vajah se din ke taapmaana main giravat darj kii jaaegi
 More rain than normal in July 252 in Safdarjung Observatory, while talking about the rain in Delhi in July
 1 millimetre kii barish record kii gai he
 While its normal level 190
 4 millimetre he
 Similarly, if we talk about the rains at Palam Airport in a month, 209 here
 6 millimetre kii barish record kii gai
 While the normal level here 191
 5 millimetre he
 260 in the meantime at Lodi Road Observatory
 3 millimetre kii barish hui jabaki yahaan kaa saamaanya str 190
 Is 4 millimeters
 kul milakar dilli main alag-alag ilaakon main july ke dauraan abtak 7 fisadi se lekar 37 fisadi tak zyada barish record kii gai he
 The special thing is that in south and southwest Delhi, more rain has been recorded this time while the rainfall has been less in other areas
 mausam ke jaankaron kaa kahana he ki barish main is asamanta ke peeche is baar monsoon ke anuthe pattern kaa haath he
 According to the Suhavnamausam department, the first week of August will also be there, there is a lot of possibility of rains in Delhi and surrounding areas for the next 48 hours
 uske baad yani 31 july ko barish menthodi kami aegi, lekin 1 agast se monsoon kii barish dilli waalon ko ek baar phir se sarabor karne kii taiyaari main lag jaaegi
 At this time it is expected that the first week of August will bring the sound of thick clouds as well as the sound of rain showers in the capital Delhi
 lekin ye barish halki se madhya darje kii hogi

 bachapan se lekar aadhi javaani tak kabhi papa ke scooter par peeche baithkar or baad main apni skuti chalaate hue pataa nahin kitni baar main tumhaare saamne se guzari hum
 But to tell the truth, i have never given you a feeling
 aaj meri haalat gaanv kii us ladki jaisi ho gai he, jisane kabhi nahin sochaa tha ki uske mohalle kaa vah 'lallu' ladkaa, jisaki taraf vah dekhnaa bhi zaruri nahin samajhati thi, ek din star ban jayega
 You have often been a landmark for me and my friends, but what i knew was that you would set a benchmark
 or haa, vah gupta antee kii ladki, jo tumhaare yahaan rose kaam karne aati thi, usko bhi main kahaan syriasli leti thi
 
 
 The By the way, she once told that she scrutinizes the examination forms coming in Vyapam
 usne yah bhi bataaya tha ki vahaan na ke baraabar padhai kiye ladke-ladkiyaan bhi form check karne kaa kaam karte hai
 Now the poor medical and engineering examiner will know where his eighth pass has been rejected
 vaise, aaj tumhaare bare main meri didi se bhi baat ho rahi thi
 She had given the PET (pre-engineering test) test only once, in which she was lagged behind by several numbers, not one or two
 tumhaare bare main yah khabar padhakar usne pehali fursat main "main-na-kahati-thi
 
 
 ? "to the tune of not possessing the blame, i put the blame on this scam, but i know very well that my sister has only pretended in the name of studies, so don't worry, in her case you get acquitted on my behalf Ho
 lekin haa, meri ek or saheli bhi thi, jisane apni zindagi ke paanch-chah saal sirf medical kii pariksha dene main bitaa die
 For so many years, she was just fulfilling her dream of becoming a doctor by taking a drop from college
 din-raat ek karne ke baavjood jab uskaa medical kii pravesh pariksha main chayan nahin hua to usne khud ko jaise-taise samajha liya
 It may be that there is something missing in his hard work, but i am thinking, after listening to your news, many people like him must have gone in flashbacks, right for once
 bahut time tak to maine yah jaanane kii koshish hi nahin kii ki aakhir yah vyaapman he kya bhalaa
 
 
 The It was also not known that Vyapam is the name of the love of the professional examination board

 If there is some 'jugaad' in Vyapam then some talk can be made
 
 
 " kabhi nahin sochaa tha ki us jugad ke neeche tumne itnaa kuch gaadkar rakhaa hua he
 Like other places, these jobs of jugaad in Bhopal used to be training grounds for the liberated leaders

 For example, some artworks were made by using garbage, under whose garb the couple were bent on trashing love
 lekin vyaapman, asal kachra to tumhaare bheetar hi ho rahaa tha
 The garbage of the dreams of those children, who were sitting at the juncture of giving medical examination without any jugaad or connection

 Ever since my childhood, i never know how many times i have passed in front of you, sitting back on my father's scooter and then driving my scooty
 lekin sach bataaun to maine kabhi bhi tumhen bhav nahin diya
 Today, i have become like a girl in the village, who never thought that the 'lallu' boy in her locality, whom she did not even think to look at, would one day become a star
 tum to mere or mere doston ke liye aksar landmark hi banakar raheen, lekin mujhe kya pataa tha ki tum to benchmark set kar dogi
 And yes, that Gupta aunt's girl, who used to come to work with you daily, also used to take her seriously

 By the way, today my sister was also talking about you
 usne sirf ek baar piiti (pre-ejineering test) kii pariksha di thi, jisamen vah ek yaa do nahin, kai number se peeche rah gai thi
 After reading this news about you, she used to say "i-don't-say" in the first leisure

 But yes, i also had another friend, who spent five-six years of her life just taking the medical examination
 itane saal tak college se drop lekar vah sirf doctor banane ke apane sapane ko puraa karne main juty rahi
 Despite doing one day and night, when he was not selected in the medical entrance examination, he deemed himself well
 aisa bilkul ho saktaa he ki uski mehnat main kuch kami rah gai ho, lekin soch rahi hum, tumhaari khabar sunakar uske jaise kai log ek baar ke liye hi sahi, flashbek main zarur gaye honge
 For a long time, i did not even try to know what the problem is
 
 
 ? yah bhi nahin pataa tha ki vyavsaayik pariksha mandal ke pyaar kaa naam hi vyaapman he
 Although i have never dealt with professional examinations, but i would often hear friends of Mathematics and Science say, "brother
 
 
 agar vyaapman main kuch 'jugad' he to kuch baat ban sakati he
 
 
 "never thought that you have so much buried under that jugaad
 baaki jagahon kii tarah bhopal main bhi jugad ke ye kaam hi chhutbhaiye netaaon ke liye training ground hote the
 Well, what to ask about the street which is not known, so i never kept the addresses of Vyapam, but i knew a lot about the Chinar Park in front of it
 jaise vahaan kooday-kachare kaa istemaal karke kuch kalakritiyaan banaai gai thim, jinaki aad main jode pyaar kaa kachra karne par tule rahete the
 But Vyapam, the real waste was happening within you
 un bacchon ke sapanom kaa kachra, jo bina kisi jugad yaa conection ke doctorl kii pariksha dene kii jurrat kar baithe the
 Come on, after such a big storm you too will change a lot
 pehali fursat main thodaa rang-rogan karvaa lenaa, kyonki ab tum sirf landmark nahin raheen
 Now Zarda will show his riders of the auto-station or airport in the mouth, "see, Madam, this was where the Vyapam scam happened

 To increase the pace of development of the country through railways, the dream of Gatiman Express is coming true
 is train kii speed ko lekar kiye ja rahe daawey kaamyaab nahin ho paa rahe hai
 Its claim of transporting between New Delhi and Agra in 90 minutes at a speed of 160 kmph seems to have faded 
 suraksha kaarnon se bhi dhimi hui spikeb tak hue trial ke aankadon ke mutabik yah train vakt ko lekar sawaalon main ghirne lagi he
 Timing of current expression increased in all seven trials
 train ke chalane ke dauraan suraksha ko lekar bhi kai chunautiyaan he
 The security wall between New Delhi to Agra has still not been built for several kilometers
 kamishnar of railway sefti (siares) is maamle main lagaataar behatar karne kii koshish main hai
 According to the trial data of Backward Moving Claims in Trials, it took 100 minutes to reach Agra from New Delhi in the first trial on July 3, 2014
 duusari baar main 103 minute, teesri baar main 148 minute, chauthi baar main 150 minute, paanchavi baar main 168 or chhathi main 115 minute main duuri tay kar pai thi
 After seeing them, the question arises that when the train also has passengers, then how will the train reach Agra in 90 minutes
 rail adhikariyon ne is sawaal par chuppi saadh rakhi he
 Shatabdi made a record of time
 Bhopal Shatabdi is the fastest train running from New Delhi to Agra
 1988 main madhavrao sindhiya ne is train ko hari jhandi dikhaai thi
 This train running for 28 years takes 117 minutes to cover 194 km from New Delhi to Agra
 vahiin saatvin trial main gatiman express ko is duuri ko tay karne main 110 minute kaa vakt laga

 nai dilli railway stesan se bhopal shatabdi subah 6:00 baje agra ke liye ravaanaa hoti he or 7:57 baje agra pahunchati he
 This train 150 km, excluding 19 cushioned places on the railway track between the two cities
 prati ghante kii raftaar se nikalati he
 The Gatiman Express will leave at 8:05 am and reach Agra at 9:55 am
 donon ke agra pahunchane main lagane vaale vakt main saat minute kaa fark hoga
 Three passenger trains will be affected due to the moving of the Gatiman Express on several trains
 inamen amritsar se mumbai jane vaali golden temple, sriganganagar se haavda jane vaali tufaan express or agra paisanger shaamil hai
 Apart from this, many freight trains will also have the effect of operating the speed

 Ayodhya, one of the tourist destinations and religious centers of India, is counted among the attractive tourist destinations of the world
 yahi kaaran he ki saal dar saal ayodhya main paryatakon kii sankhya main do se paanch pratishat kaa ijapha ho rahaa he
 Not only this, about 125 million people from different parts of the country also come here
 vahiin duusari taraf website 'trip adwiser india' ne yahaan aane vaale paryatakon ke man main is jagah ko lekar dar paidaa karne main koi kasar nahin chodi he
 On the English-language website, Ayodhya has been described as 'not good place to visit for India'
 or yah baat duniya bhar ke logon ko di ja rahi he
 Revised on 19 February 2014, this website has stated that if you are a tourist and not of religious faith, please do not see Ayodhya
 1992 main yahaan vivaadit dhaancha dhahaae jane ke baad se ayodhya ko puri tarah se kadi suraksha main rakhaa gaya he
 Where there are checkposts at a distance of 10–10 feet
 ayodhya main ramajnmabhumi ke alaava aakarshan ke taur par maniramdaas kii chhavnee, kanak bhawan or sita rasoi he
 The Military Temple, Gulabbadi, Guptarghat, Chakrahari Ji Vishnu Temple, Dasharatha Bhavan, Fort Calcutta, Tulsi Udyan, Ram Ki Paidi, Moti Mahal and Faizabad Museum are also famous here
 gauratlab he ki vivaadit ramajnmabhumi mandir se satee sita rasoi 1992 main babari dhaancha dhahaane ke dauraan hi dhwast hokar gum ho chuki he
 At the same time, instead of Faizabad Museum, the office of Senior Police Inspector has been created
 iske alaava ek or website 'haali de ikyuu' main ayodhya ke darshneey sthalon main 22 dharmik or puratathvik mahatv ke sthalon kii suchi di gai he
 In which Motimahal has been ranked first, Sita Kitchen seventh ranking and Faizabad Museum 19th
 is bare main kshetreey paryaton adhikari brijraj singh kehete hai ki 'ayodhya paryaton ke nakshe par he or adhikrut suchanaaen internet par uplabdh hai'
 He said that 'misinformation of the website has no effect on the tourists

 After the implementation of GST, it was expected that tax evasion would be curbed, but this does not seem to be happening
 kaarobaari rojaanaa nae-nae tareekon se tex chori ko anjaam de rahe hai
 The e-way bill was also expected to stop the movement of goods without paying tax, but a case of tax evasion in Chhattisgarh has shocked the officials
 ek kaarobaari vibhaag ko gopneey shikaayat nahin karata to i-ve bill kii hakeekat saamne nahin aati
 With the opening of the e-way bill poll, the accused businessman paid a fine of 22 lakhs to get the case cleared at the earliest and got the case file closed
 kanoonee taur par sarkari amale ko is maamle kii FIR darj karwaani chahie thi
 But after marking the questions on the loyalty of the department with the devotion of the officers, the top officers considered the matter as expedient
 lekin is maamle ne saafe kar diya he ki i-ve bill system kii tod bhi tex choron ne nikaal rakhi he
 What is the whole matter with the Pan Masala Transport Mentax theft case in Ambikapur, Chhattisgarh, it is clear that Pan Masala businessmen are taxing likewise
 haal hi main is prakaar kaa ek maamla durg main pakadaa gaya tha
 a penalty and tax of 1
5 million has been levied against this spice businessman
 is maamle main paan masala kaarobaari ne jo inovis banaaya tha usamen likhaa tha ki yah maal puduccheri se pashchim bengal bheja ja rahaa he
 But this cargo was being emptied in the fort
 yah karrwai kareeb ek hafte pehle kii gai thi
 It is clear from these two cases that Pan Masala businessmen are stealing tax directly by transporting the wrong novice for transporting goods 
 chhattisgarh vanijyik kar vibhaag ke adhikari ke mutabik uttar pradesh ke paan masala kaarobaari par yah karrwai kii gai he
 This businessman had filled the pan masala in the truck and left for Ambikapur in Chhattisgarh
 lekin maal ke saath mili inovis main kaarobaari ne maal kaa bill uttarapradesh ke gorakhpur se odisha ke liye katwaya tha
 When authorities checked the goods, this fudge surfaced
 transporting ke dauraan i-ve bill bhi nahin banaaya gaya tha
 In this case, the investigation team imposed a fine and tax of Rs 22 lakh 10 thousand after seizing the goods
 i-ve bill lagu hone ke baad se ab tak vibhaag ek karod se zyada kaa jurmaana vasuul kar chukaa he
 Businessmen are also being instructed and strong fines are being imposed

 babulal ne shuukravaar ko party pratinidhimandal ke saath rajyapal draupadi murmu se mulaakaat kar isse sambandhit saboot saunpane kaa daawa kiya he
 He also made public a copy of a letter written by bjp's then state president Ravindra Rai to BJP national president Amit Shah as evidence
 yah patr 19 janvari 2015 ko likhaa gaya tha
 According to the letter, Rs 11 crore was given to six mlas Ganesh Ganjhu, Randhir Kumar Singh, Naveen Jaiswal, Amar Kumar Bauri, Alok Kumar Chaurasia and Janki Yadav who went to BJP from Jhavimo
 babulal ke anusaar, inamen se amar bouri ko bijepi ne ek karod rupee diye the
 Two crore rupees were given to the remaining five mlas
 babulal ke mutabik yah ghatana loktantr par kalank he
 He has demanded a CBI inquiry into the entire case
 len-dein main shaamil sabhi logon par exiar darj kar un par karrwai karne kii maang kii he
 The matter is in the Speaker's court In February 2015, Babulal Marandi and party general secretary Pradeep Yadav wrote a letter complaining of defection under the 10th schedule against speaker Dinesh Oraon against six party mlas

 So far 53 people have testified in this case

 aadhaar or anya kanoon (sanshodhan) vidheyak, 2019 par bahes ke baad rajyasabha main 8 july ko jawaab dete hue, kendriya kanoon mantri ravishankar prasad ne supreme court ke nyaayadhishon dwaara 'kathor shabdon' ke upyog par apni aapatti vyakt kii
 They are of Justice
 es
 In the decision of Union of India in Puttaswamy (retd
) V
 Justice D
 vaai
 Chandrachud was expressing his opinion on the tone of disagreement
 ek ore jahaan supreme court ne aadhaar adhinium, 2016 ko sashart anumati di thi, vahiin nyaayamurti chandrachud ne apni raay main, is kanoon ko puri tarah se radd karne kii baat kahi thi
 In his view, the Aadhaar bill of the government was enacted as a money bill and enacting it without the approval of the Rajya Sabha was a 'fraud with the Constitution'
 lekin itani kathor tippanee bhi sarkaar ko nae sire se aalochana karne se shaayad hi roak pai
 Through the Amendment Bill, now passed by both houses of Parliament, the government has shown the way to a new tradition of manipulation
 vidheyak ko raashtrapati kii sahmati kaa intjaar he, jis par ve nishchit rup se sahmati de bhi denge
 This bill is going to give rise to many new problems
 unamem se mukhya he kalyaan yojanaon ke daayre se un logon ko baahar rakhe jane par chuppi jinke paas aadhaar number nahin he
 The Bill invites legislative procedures by empowering the executive to provide alternative means of identification of those who fail to provide Aadhaar-based identification
 aisa karte hue yah jivan ke adhikaar ke samvidhan ke vaade ko puri tarah se parivartaneey maanata he
 The problem is exacerbated by attempts to re-validate Aadhaar's private use
 apane mul rup main, dhara 57 ke jariye kanoon, rajya or nijee sansthaaon ko ek vyakti kii pahchaan sthapit karne ke liye aadhaar sanrachana kaa upyog karne kii anumati detaa he
 In Puttaswamy, the Supreme Court was aware of the dangers of allowing such use and unanimously declared Section 57 unconstitutional even while retaining other parts of the Aadhaar Act
 nyaayamurti e
 K
 sikri ne likhaa, ''bhale hi ham maanate hai ki vidhayika kaa aisa iraadaa nahin phir bhi (dhara 57) kaa prabhaav aisa hoga jisase nijee sansthaaon ko ek vyakti kii biomitric or janasankhyikeey jaankaree ke vyavsaayik istemaal kaa mauka mil jayega
 "the court felt, in allowing such use, this law would directly violate the privacy of these individuals
" nayaa prastaavit sanshodhan adaalat ke is nishkarsh ko maanane se inkaar karata he
 It says that even though it is 'voluntary', it practically serves to impose the basis on citizenship
 iskaa gaharaai se vishleshan karne par sarkari daawey kii sachaai spasht ho jaati he
 In the new bill, which will soon become law, Aadhaar seems 'voluntary' as it requires private companies to get the consumer's 'consent' before using it to verify identity
 lekin iske saath, yah vidheyak telegraph adhinium jo mobile phone operataron par lagu hota he or dhan shodhan nivaaran adhinium, jo bainkon par lagu hota he, donon main sanshodhan karke aadhaar ko ek 'kevaisi' dastavej ke rup main upyog karne kii anumati detaa he
 a passport is only another document that can now be used to establish your identity
 isamen ham un dastavejon ko nahin gin rahe hai jinhen bhavishya main sarkaar adhishuchet kar sakati he
 Thus making Aadhaar practically mandatory increases the risk of data privacy violations, a risk that will only be exacerbated by the lack of independent regulatory controls and the fact that we still have no data protection laws
 dhara 57 par supreme court kii pratikriya ko dekhte hue yah vachan diya gaya tha ki is manch kaa upyog vyavsaayik shoshan ke raste kholane ke liye nahin karne diya jayega or sarkaar ne yah vishwaas bhi dilaayaa tha ki aadhaar ko anivaary nahin kiya jayega, nayaa sanshodhan ise sanvaidhanik rup se chunauti die jane ke daravaaje khol detaa he
 Attempting to disregard the Supreme Court's decision and re-apply Section 57 in a practical new way is an attack on the guarantee of the right to privacy which is now considered a fundamental right
 iske saath hi aadhaar nahin hone ke kaaran sarkari yojanaon ke daayre se baahar rah jane vaale logon ko bhi uske daayre main laane se jude vyavhaarik praavdhaanon kaa abhaav, is bhavi kanoon ko phir se supreme court main chunauti die jane ke paryaapt aadhaar detaa he

 mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ko uttar pradesh main kaman sanbhale ek saal puraa hone ja rahaa he

 lakhanu ke manch par daawa kiya gaya ki wibront gujarat summit ne gujarat main bade nivesh kaa rasta kholte hue gujarat ko kaarobaar main desh kaa agrani rajya bana diya
 Therefore, Uttar Pradesh will be made an important commercial area of the country following this pattern

 — Arvind Kejriwal (@arvindkejriwal)july 4, 2018chif justise deepak mishra ne tippanee karte hue kaha ki uparajyapal ko dilli sarkaar ke saath milakar kaam karnaa chahie
 Apart from police, land and public order, Delhi Legislative Assembly can make any law
 haalanki, supreme court ne ye bhi kaha he ki dilli main kisi tarah kii araajaktaa kii koi jagah nahin he, sarkaar or alji ko saath main kaam karnaa chahie
 The situation in Delhi is different from the rest of the Union Territories and full states, so everyone should work together
 chif justise deepak mishra ne tippanee karte hue kaha ki samvidhan kaa paalan sabhi kii duty he, samvidhan ke mutabik hi prashasnic faisle lenaa samuhik duty he
 The SC said that there should be cordial relations between the Center and the state as well
 rajyon ko rajya or samavarti suchi ke tahat sanvaidhanik adhikaar kaa istemaal karne kaa haq he
 Cabinet decisions cannot hang LG While delivering the judgment, Justice Chandrachud said that the nation fails when the country's democratic institutions are shut down
 hamaari socity main alag vichaaron ke saath chalanaa jaruri he
 Justice Chandrachud has said that politicians and officials should work together even in the midst of differences
 unhone kaha ki asli shakti or jimmedaari chuni hui sarkaar kii hi banati he
 The Lt
 Governor cannot hang the decisions of the Cabinet
 supreme court kii peeth ne kaha he ki alji kaa kaam rashtrahit kaa dhyaan rakhana he, unhen is baat ko dhyaan main rakhana chahie ki chuni hui sarkaar ke paas logon kii sahmati he
 lg's approval is not necessary for every decision
 The SC has said that the Lieutenant Governor should decide only on the advice of the cabinet, otherwise the matter should be referred to the President
 justise chandrachud ne kaha he ki alji kaa kaam dilli sarkaar ke har faisle par rokatoke karnaa nahin he, naa hi mantriparishad ke har faisle ko alji kii manjuuri kii jarurat nahin he

 supreme court ne agar kejariwal ko banaaya dilli kaa ‘bos’ to milengi ye teen ‘super power’supreme court ne badla hoicourt kaa faislisase pehle yah maamla dilli hai court main tha, jahaan se aam aadmi party or arvind kejariwal ko jhatka laga tha
 On 4 August 2016, the Delhi High Court, while ruling on the fight for the rights between Delhi Government vs Lieutenant Governor, said that the Lieutenant Governor is the administrative head of Delhi and the Delhi government cannot legislate without the will of LG
 supreme court ne hoicourt ke is faisle ko puri tarah se palat diya he
 The High Court had made it clear that LG is not bound in any way to uphold the Delhi government's decision
 vah apane vivek ke aadhaar par faisla le sakate hai
 While the Delhi government will have to get lg's consent before issuing any notification
 in muddon ko lekar kejariwal-lg main shuru hui thi adhikaron kii jangyahi vajah he ki mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal hameshaa alji par filein atakane kaa aarope lagaate rahete hai
 Recently, he was sitting on a sit-in at the LG office with his three ministers for over a week
 arvind kejariwal kii taraf se court main kai tark die gaye hai, jisamen unhone bataaya he ki uparajyapal unke kaam main roda ban rahe hai
 What were those 10 arguments of Kejriwal government: 1
 chaparasi se lekar adhikariyon kii niyukti transfar-posting or unke khilaaf kaarywahi karne kaa adhikaar nahin rah gaya isliye sarkari mulajim chuni hui sarkaar ke aadesh nahin maanate
 2
 seva vibhaag up rajyapal ke adheen kiye jane kii vajah se guest teachers ko permanent karne or nae shikshakon kii niyukti nahin ho pai
 3
 seva vibhaag sarkaar ke adheen naa hone se kai nae banaae gaye mohalla clinics ke sanchaalan ke liye doctor paramedical or nursing staff kii niyukti nahin ho pai
 4
 anti karpshan branch ko uparajyapal ke adheen kiye jane ke baad se sarkaar bhrasht karmchaariyon or adhikariyon ke khilaaf koi kaarywahi nahin kar paa rahi jisase sarkaar main bhrashtachar badha
 The campaign was pushed against the government's corruption
 5
 Due to the Lt
 Governor being the last authority to implement the policy decisions, the elected government could not implement many schemes
 6
 Many schemes like the CCTV scheme, plans to set up new mohalla clinics, home delivery of services, home delivery plans of ration were disrupted for a long time
 7
 It is necessary to send every file to the Lieutenant Governor for approval and the Lieutenant Governor sat on the files for a long time
 8
 The appointment of advisors and experts appointed by the government was rejected by the Lieutenant Governor which affected the government's work
 9
 He did not reverse the policy decision of the government due to the cabinet's advice not binding on the Lieutenant Governor
 10
 Without the power of the central government and after the orders of the High Court thereon, it became difficult for the elected government to run the government in Delhi

 The delimitation commission that is being set up may aim to pursue these issues

 in) Article 370 and 35A is hot on the atmosphere
 Let me tell you that when BJP President Amit Shah was campaigning in Lok Sabha elections, he was very aggressive about Article 370, 35 (A)
 shah kaa daawa tha ki vah kashmir se 370 hataa kar rahenge
 But now that he is the Home Minister, he has to think through every aspect and move forward
 jail se baahar aane ke baad bollywood abhinayta sanjay dutt apni pehali film kii shooting shuru karne vaale hai
 Sanjay Dutt will start shooting for his upcoming film 'bhoomi' from February 15
 film main sanjay ke saath aditi raav hydari hongi jo unki beti kaa kirdaar nibhaati najar aaengi
 The film will be directed by Umang Kumar, who made 'mary Kom' with Priyanka Chopra earlier
 sanjay dutt ne sharaab ke nashe main ranbir kapur se kaha, kya soch ke tumne 'barfi' film kitajanagari main shootis film kii shooting tajanagari agra main shuru hogi
 This will be the first time that the veteran actor of Bollywood will face the camera after four years
 bataa den ki yah film isi saal agast main relies honi he
 Manisha will be the mother of 'sanjay Dutt', the role was found in this film, the previous film Sanjay Dutt worked with Aamir Khan in 'PK' before going to jail
 is film main unhone bhairo singh kaa kirdaar nibhaayaa tha
 a song was also shot on him
 sanjay dutt kii byopic main anoushka kii entry
 
 kyon gaye the jail1993 ke mumbai bam dhamaakon ke maamle main sanjay dutt par tada or arms act ke tahat cese chale
 Sanjay was acquitted of TADA charges but was sentenced to 6 years by the court under the Arms Act
 supreme court ne vyaapman ghotaale ke saare maamle sibiai ko saunp die hai, or iske saath hi sibiai ke 'jimmedaar' kandhon par ek or file kaa boj aa gaya
 When almost every major case becomes complicated, it is diverted to the CBI, so what is the CBI after all? 
 
 ? The Central Bureau of Investigation, or the CBI, is India's most important investigative agency, which functions under the Government of India
 sibiai kii sthapana 1941 main ‘special police ysteblishment’ ke taur par aantarik suraksha kii dekharekh ke uddeshy se kii gai thi, or 1963 main sanstha kaa naam badalakar sibiai rakh diya gaya
 Significantly, despite being the most important investigative agency, the cbi's road has never been easy, and questions were raised about its impartiality during almost every major investigation
 pichley saal hi supreme court ne koyala ghotaale kii jaanch ke sandarbh main sibiai ko fatkaarte hue use 'pinjre main band tote' kii sangya di thi, jo sirf apane 'maalik' kii boli bolta he
 According to the court, the CBI is a parrot that has many owners
 dilachasp baat yah thi ki court kii is tippanee se bahut-se log sahamat hote dikhaai die
 Not only this, recently the Supreme Court also said that there should be an inquiry against former CBI Director Ranjit Sinha in the case of misuse of office
 sinha par aarope he ki unhone pad par rahete hue na keval koyala ghotaale se jude aropiyon se mulaakaat kii, balki unke saath jaanch se judi jaankariyaan bhi saajha kin
 On the other hand, there are also some successes on the part of the CBI surrounded by allegations and criticisms of political interference, which have been discussed
 kuch saal pehle hua uttar pradesh kaa enecharem ghotaalaa, jisamen sibiai ne kuch ahm giraftaaryaan kii thim
 Many politicians and officials were caught in the scandal during Mayawati's chief ministership and had to go to jail
 uttar pradesh main yah pehla aisa ghotaalaa tha, jisane rasookh vaale kai logon ko salaakhon ke peeche pahunchaa diya tha
 Sukhram, who was the Telecom Minister in the cabinet of former Prime Minister PV Narasimha Rao, was also caught in the CBI circle
 varsh 1998 main sibiai kii taraf se daayar kii gai chargeshit main sukhram or unke ek sahyogi par teen lakh rupee kii rishwat lene or taar kharidne main dhaandhlee karne kaa aarope lagaaya gaya tha, jiske baad sukhram ko dilli kii ek adaalat ne paanch saal kii sazaa sunai thi
 Though 86-year-old Sukhram sought exemption in sentence citing age, the CBI had appealed for strict punishment, calling him a habitual offender
 isi saal sibiai kii ek vishesh adaalat ne purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh ko koyala khadaan ke aavanton main hue kathith ghotaale se jude ek maamle main talab kiya tha, haalanki manmohan singh ke pradhanmantritv kaal main sibiai aisa karne kii himmat nahin juta pai thi
 The comments tamaam tarah ke rajnatik rodon kaa saamana karte hue kisi bhi jaanch ko anjaam tak pahunchaana aasaan kaam nahin he or shaayad isiilie sibiai ko ek swytt sanstha (autonomous body) banane kii maang hoti rahi he
 In 2013, the UPA government had also filed an affidavit for autonomy of the CBI following stringent comments by the Supreme Court, which included measures to keep the institution free from government influence
 ab sawaal yah uthta he ki kya vartmaan sarkaar is bare main kuch or kadam uthaaegi yaa apana rajnatik ullu sidhaa karne ke liye yah tota ab bhi maalik kii boli bolta hi rah jayega
 
 
 The central beuro of investigeshan, yani sibiai bharat kii sabase ahm jaanch agency he, jo bharat sarkaar ke antargat kaam karti he
 The CBI was established in 1941 as a 'special Police Establishment' for the purpose of overseeing internal security, and in 1963 the name of the institution was changed to CBI
 gauratlab he ki sabase ahm jaanch agency hone ke baavjood sibiai kii raahen kabhi aasaan nahin raheen, or lagbhag har badi jaanch ke dauraan uski nishpakshta ko lekar sawaal khadey hue
 Only last year, the Supreme Court rebuked the CBI in the context of the coal scam investigation, calling it a 'cage parrot', which only speaks of its 'owner'
 court ke mutabik, sibiai aisa tota he, jiske kai maalik hai
 The interesting thing was that many people appeared to agree with this comment of the court
 yahi nahin, haal hi main supreme court ne yah bhi kaha ki sibiai ke purv nideshak ranjit sinha ke khilaaf pad ke durupyog ke maamle main jaanch honi hi chahie
 Sinha is accused of not only meeting the accused in the coal scam while in office, but also sharing information related to the investigation with him
 duusari ore, rajnatik hastkshep ke aarope or aalochanaon se ghiri sibiai ke hisse main kuch safaltaaen bhi hai, jinaki charchaa hoti rahi hai
 Uttar Pradesh's NHRM scam took place a few years ago, in which the CBI made some significant arrests
 mayawati ke mukhyamantritv kaal main hue is ghotaale kii aanch main kai rajaneta or adhikari fanse the or unhen jail janaa padaa tha
 This was the first such scam in Uttar Pradesh, which led many people with influence behind bars
 bhootpurv pradhanmantri pivi narsimha raav ke mantrimandal main doorsanchaar mantri rahe sukhram bhi sibiai ke ghere main aakar hi pakade gaye the
 In a charge sheet filed on behalf of the CBI in 1998, Sukhram and one of his associates were accused of taking bribe of three lakh rupees and rigging to buy wire, after which Sukhram was sentenced to five years by a Delhi court
 was
 haalanki 86 saal ke sukhram ne umr kaa hawala dete hue sazaa main riyaayat maangi thi, lekin sibiai ne unhen adatan apradhi bataate hue sakht sazaa kii apil kii thi
 In the same year, a special CBI court had summoned former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in a case related to the alleged scam in allocation of coal mines, although the CBI could not muster courage to do so during Manmohan Singh's prime ministership
 tippaniyan Facing all kinds of political hurdles, it is not an easy task to carry out any investigation and perhaps this is why there has been a demand for the CBI to become an autonomous body
 2013 main supreme court kii kadi tippaniyon ke baad upie sarkaar ne sibiai kii swaittata ke liye shapathpatr bhi daakhil kiya tha, jisamen sanstha ko sarkari prabhaav se mukt rakhane ke upaay shaamil the
 Now the question arises whether the current government will take some more steps in this or whether this parrot will still continue to speak the owner's bid to straighten its political owl

 *** Along with the team of the film 'mary Kom', Priyanka Chopra also wants to leave no stone unturned to complete the shooting schedule of the film

 For the past two weeks, Priyanka has been busy shooting the film continuously
 manali ke baad philhal himachal pradesh main dharmashala ke paas film kii shooting chal rahi he
 Suddenly the rain started falling on the Sunday
 police or sthaneey prashasan se jin jagahon par shooting karne ke liye anumati lee gai thi, vahaan tay samay main kaam khatm karnaa behad jaruri ho gaya tha
 In such a situation, director Umang Kumar decided to work without a break
 priyanka chopra ko jab isaki jaankaree mili to unhone film kii unit ko yah kaha ki jab tak film ke kru member brake nahin lenge, tab tak vah bhi brake nahin lengi
 Lunch or dinner takes an hour and if the people of the unit cannot eat, then they will also be hungry

 Everyone tried to convince them
 priyanka ko yah samajhaayaa gaya ki unhen aise halaat main kaam karne kaa anubhav nahin he, isaliye yah unke swasthya ke liye sahi nahin hoga

 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ke gotra ko lekar chhide siyaasi ghamaasan ke bich kashmir panditon ke dharmaguru or vaidic shaastra ke jaankaar pandit omkar nath shastri kaa kahana he ki rahul ne apane gotra ko lekar jo daawa kiya tha wo sahi he
 In a special conversation with Aaj Tak, Pandit Omkar Nath Shastri said that the girl's gotra usually changes after marriage
 chunki purv pradhanmantri indira gandhi ne firoz gandhi se shaadi ke baad dharm parivartan nahin kiya isliye ve kashmiri brahman hi raheen
 His cremation was also done by Vedic customs
 isliye indira ke bete rajeev gandhi or sanjay gandhi donon kaa gotra vahi rahegaa jo maa kaa tha
 Pandit Omkar Nath Shastri said that since Feroze Gandhi was a Parsi, he had no gotra, if Indira had changed her religion, her gotra would also have ended, as it did not
 unhone kaha ki purv pradhanmantri rajeev gandhi ne bheeitaly kii sonia gandhise vivaah kiya
 But Rajiv too did not change his religion
 isliye rajeev ko unki maa kaa gotra mila, isi tarah rajeev kaa gotra unke putr rahul gandhi ko mila
 Therefore, Rahul Gandhi's claim is correct that he is a Kaul Brahmin and his gotra is Dattatreya
 omkar nath shastri ne kaha ki shastron kaa adhyayan thik se kiya jaae to aise niyam hai jisamen maa kaa gotra bacchon ko miltaa he
 Let me tell you that during the election campaign, Congress President Rahul Gandhi had told his caste Kashmiri Kaul Brahmins and Dattatreya gotra during darshan of Brahma temple of Pushkar
 darasal chunaav prachaar ke dauraan rahul ne kai mandiron main darshan kiye
 During this time, the BJP raised the question that they should tell their gotra
 isse pehle gujarat chunaav ke dauraan somnath darshan ke samay rahul gandhi ke dharm ko lekar vivaad chhid gaya tha
 After which the Congress released a press conference wearing photographs of Rahul Gandhi wearing janeu and he was described as janeudhari brahmin
 gauratlab he ki desh ke pehle pradhanmantri pandit jawahar laal nehru kashmiri brahman the, jinke baad kii vanshavali main unki beti indira gandhi kaa zikr bhi kashmiri pandit ke taur par miltaa he kyonki unhone ek parsi firoz gandhi se vivaah ke baad apana dharm parivartan nahin kiya

 Barkha said that if the party does not support Rahul Gandhi, he should leave
 barkhaa ne kaha ki agar rahul gandhi ko adhyaksh banaaya gaya to yah dizaster hoga
 Barkha pointed out that Ajay Maken and Rahul Gandhi said that the Congress Party raises the issue of women's safety with a lot of noise, but there is a big difference in its speech and action
 barkhaa ne kaha ki ek saal pehle mere saath budtamiji hui thi, jisaki shikaayat maine sonia gandhi se bhi kii thi
 But no action was taken on that
 barkhaa ne kaha - ham milane gaye the or rahul party main biji thebarakha ne tikat bantwaarein ke upar bhi baat kii, unhone kaha ki jab mahilaon ko tikat dene kii baari ai tab unhone is mudde ko darkinar kar diya
 Hamrahul had come to meet Gandhi on this issue, but his peon did not even come
 28 march ko hamane rahul gandhi se milane kii koshish kii, lekin kuch nahin ho paaya
 It was a women's fast that day, but Rahul Gandhi was busy partying at the Sangrila Hotel that night
 hamaari koi nahin sunatounhone kaha ki agar vinay katiyaar jaise log priyanka gandhi par coment karte hai, to rahul gandhi ke offis kii ore se hamen pradarshan karne ko kaha jaataa he

 True story! # padmavatia post shared by Ranveer Singh (@ranveersingh) on Sep 1, 2017 at 10:01pm PDT Arvind Kejriwal's tweet created a ruckus before he left home for his nomination
 hangaamaa kaa matlab chunavi chakallas karne waalon ko mazaa aane laga he
 Kejriwal has said to Kiran Bedi in a tweet that i challenge Kiran Bedi for a debate which should be conducted by a neutral and show all TV channels
 agar aisa hua to america kii tarah bharat ke chunaav ko banane kaa sapana dekhne waalon kii muraad puri ho jaaegi
 Every time there is talk of debate and every time it remains
 hamaare dalon ne amareeki chunaav kii sari nakal kar lee bas bahes ke liye himmat nahin juta paye
 There has been a lot of fighting on Twitter for the rationale of the debate between Kiran Bedi and Kejriwal's supporters
 donon kheme ke log ek-duusare ko lalkaar rahe hai
 Some are saying that Kiran Bedi will be ready for debate, while another is saying that she will leave the field and run away
 is bahes main main bhi kud padaa ki agar donon pakshon ko manzur ho to main isaki ekaring karne ke liye taiyaar hum
 It will also be a test of neutrality to me that how much i give opportunity to both sides to speak
 yah bhi kam bada jokhim nahin hoga
 When the supporters of both of them will keep weighing one thing on the scales whether i lean towards it or lean towards it
 jo bhi he is imtihaan main khud ko daanv par lagaakar main bhi thode samay ke liye romanchit ho gaya
 Well, Arvind and Kiran should decide together who will be neutral
 kya arvind or kiran main bahes honi chahie
 Where can there be debate in a literate state like Delhi? kab hogi
 Both come from a different non-political background
 donon aaj kii raajnneetik pranali ke aalochak rahe hai
 It is true that if the stakes are from Arvind, Kiran will hesitate to accept it, but in politics it is not a big deal
 kiran bedi bhi sweekaar kar kejariwal ko maat de sakati hai
 If there is a debate, we will be able to see this politics afresh
 netritv kii tarkit or bauddhik kshamta ko parakh sakenge
 This will be an exciting opportunity for democracy which Delhiites should not let go
 jab vidhansabha main aamane-saamne ho sakati hai to pehle kyon nahin ho sakati he
 This is the old recipe of Arvind Kejriwal that let's go face to face for debate
 pichley chunaav main bhi unhone isaki chunauti di thi
 In the Lok Sabha too, Narendra Modi was challenged in a way but there was no debate
 congress kaanp gai hogi ki rahul or narendra modi kaa soch kar hi
 But Arvind and Kiran are equal in this case in Delhi
 unhen ek duusare se bhay khaane kii koi zarurat nahin he
 i think Kiran Bedi should be accepted
 unhone hamaari samvaadadaata ketki ongre se kaha he ki main bahes main yakeen nahin karti hum, karke dikhaane main rakhti hum
 The debate takes place within the Legislative Assembly
 unhone yah bhi kaha he ki 500 channel hai kis par dibet karenge or kisko chunenge
 But Arvind has said that someone neutral and show all the channels
 mujhe nahin lagata ki channelon ko isse dikkt honi chahie
 Channels show a rally of leaders at the same time
 kumaar vishwaas ne bhi kiran bedi kaa ek purana twit nikaal kar twit kiya he
 Kiran Bedi tweeted while watching the debate between Obama and Roumani and said don't miss watching the debate
 phir bhi kiran bedi kaa yah kahana ki bahes sirf vidhansabha ke bheetar hoti he, sahi nahin he
 The real debate in democracy is between the people
 janata ke aamane-saamne hoti he, ek duusare kii taraf peeth karke chunauti dene se hi loktantr mahaan nahin ho jaataa
 It is further expanded by coming face to face
 phir bhi bahes kii chunauti sweekaar karnaa ek bada ranneetik faisla bhi he
 Kejriwal too would have challenged under any strategy

 Rajnandgaon police say that the area has inaccessible hills, dense forests and easy access to the National Highway Naxalites, due to which they are leaving Bastar and Dantewada and moving through dense forests towards the cities of west and north
 chhuria kaa naksali andolan ek dashak purana he
