 kumbh main aghori nahin aate hai
 
 
 They live in the crematorium and play with the corpses
 
 
 maance khate hai or raat ko tantric kriyaayein karte hai
 But how the Aghoris have left the crematorium and camped at the Kumbh Mela
 mere man main sahaj ye baat us vakt ai jab mere ek mitra satendra singh ne mujhe aghori ashram ke bare main bataai to unako lekar utsukata jaagi kyonki tivi par kapaal or sharaab pite kaale kapadon main daraavne najar aane vaale kai aghoriyon ko dekh chukaa tha
 The same perception about Aghoris ranges from Naga Sadhus to common people
 
 
 
 Because Aghoris were shown on TV while performing tantric actions in the crematorium
 
 The worship of the Aghoris begins at night
 
 So at the Kumbh Mela, at night we reached the camp of the World Aghor Trust Council
 mumbai se kumbh meley pahunte aghoriyon se ek ashram main mulaakaat hui inke guruaghori ashish hai
 
 
 
 aghori jahaan puja kar rahe the vahaan ganesh ji or gautam buddha kii murti ke haathon main mund he
 
 safed kapadon main aghori ashish kii puja chal rahi he
 Why skeletons and skulls are necessary in the worship of Aghoris
 
 He was visibly annoyed that the media showed the Aghoris drinking only alcohol while eating meat in the crematorium
 vishwa aghori nyaas parishad ke ashish aghori bataate hai tivi ne ye failaa diya gaya aghori murda khaane vaale or sharaab pine vaale hote hai lekin aghori kaa matlab he saralata he
 Eating meat is some element of it living among the dead, he lived in the crematorium where there is even place
 
 
 raja mara to wo bhi raakh
 
 chor mara to wo raakh or sadhu mara to wo bhi raakh jahaan sambhaav ho
 
 khopadi rakhane kaa kya matlab he ye kisi or kii khopadi nahin balki meri he
 
 
 This means that we drove a lot, now we handed over our minds to the Guru
 
 Therefore, the skull is kept here
 
 We put the ego of the skull in the hands of our Guru, this sign is that the idol of Ganesha also has a skull in his hands and the skull in the hands of Mahatma Buddha
 
 
 aghori kehete hai ki ye donon gyaan ke avatar he lihaaja hamane apana ahankaar in guruon ke haath main de diya he

 com / hwjhrslj5p benjamin netanyahu shanivaar ko isroyal main sabase lambey samay tak seva dene vaale pradhanmantri ban gaye hai
 Earlier, this record was in the name of David Ben Gurion, the founder of the country
 netanyahu ko pradhanmantri ke pad par 13 saal or 127 din ho chuke hai, jo ki isroyal ke pehle pradhanmantri rahe gurian se ek din adhik he
 According to Netanyahu's 4,873-day Jerusalem Post, Israel has had 25,981 days in existence, of which Netanyahu has held the post of Prime Minister of the country for 4,873 days in his tenure to date
 unhen pachavin baar ke liye is saal pradhanmantri chunaa gaya lekin sarkaar banane main asamarth rahane ke chalate unhone phir se chunaav main jane kaa faisla kiya he
 Netanyahu, who became the Prime Minister of Ezrael for the fifth time, is very famous among the people
 netanyahu vartmaan main bhrashtachar ko lekar pareshaaniyon kaa saamana kar rahe hai or unke istife kii maang bhi kii ja rahi he
 The Prime Minister denied all the allegations leveled against him and called him politically motivated
 vah 1996 main pehali baar chunaav jeet kar 46 varsh kii umr main ijraal ke sabase yuva pradhanmantri bane the
 Netanyahu became the first leader born after 1948 after the country came into existence to reach the post of Prime Minister
 netanyahu par bhrashtachar ke aarope lagate rahe hainetanyahu par bhrashtachar ke alag-alag aarope lagate rahe hai
 At the same time, there were also reports that a French broker gave Netanyahu millions of euros in the 2009 election campaign so that he could win the election
 saath hi netanyahu or unki patni sara par ek sarkari contractor se nijee kaam karaane kaa aarope bhi laga tha
 In addition to this, investigations were started on Netanyahu for disturbances in warships purchased from Germany
 muzaffarpur balika grih cond se sambandhit ab kisi bhi maamle kii reporting nahin hogi
 The Patna High Court has imposed this restriction on print and electronic media
 pehle ho chuki jaanch or aage hone vaali jaanch se sambandhit koi khabar hi nahin chhapegi
 The Editors Guild has expressed concern over this order of the High Court
 gild ne kaha he ki court ko kahaan media kii swatantraaa kii raksha kerani chahie, lekin us par ankush lagaaya ja rahaa he
 The Guild has appealed to the Supreme Court and the Chief Justice of Patna High Court to review its decision
 muzaffarpur balika grih cond aaj aapke saamne nahin hota agar media ne ise ujagar nahin kiya hota
 i do not know the print, there was a lot of news in TV, but the way the Kashish news channel consistently exposed the matter, it would not have reached the CBI door
 shaayad adaalat ke darvaaze tak bhi nahin
 The court should have taken cognizance that this heinous crime has come out due to the media
 ek campus main 30 se adhik bacchiyon kaa balaatkaar or unke saath yon atyaachaar saamaanya ghatana nahin he
 But later, when the activism of the rest of the media increased, some more new facts were revealed
 isliye kam se kam is maamle main court se lekar bihar sarkaar ko media kaa shukraguzaar hona chahie
 The court should note that due to media reports, a Kabina minister had to step down and the CBI raided him too
 media kii reporting se hi zaahir ho rahaa he ki is maamle ko dabaane main bade bade log lage hai
 Reporting will only help the investigation because the investigation has already started due to reporting
 reporting par ankush lagane se us shankaa ko bal milegaa ki bade logon ne khud ko bachaane kaa intazaam kar liya he
 One way to save is to avoid the case
 lagaataar reporting hogi to nae nae tathy saamne aaenge or jaanch agenciyon par dabaav rahegaa ki vah apni report lekar adaalat ke saamne samay samay par haazir hoti rahe
 The reporting of the girl child home scandal is also for the trust of those girls
 un par lagaataar khatara bana rahegaa
 One can exert pressure
 kai baar gavaahon kii jaan ko khatara ho jaataa he
 Shouldn't the media investigate all these fears, and bring them to the court and society through their news? Those girls do not have any parents
 ve satta tantra kii madad se aish kar rahe darindon ke aage laachaar hai
 At this time, media reporting could be their strength
 isliye zaruri he ki adaalat apane is faisle kii samiksha kare
 With this order, there will be happiness in the section of the media, who were under pressure to go to the bottom of this scandal and bring the news
 jo lambey samay tak reporting kii aupchaarikta puri kar ek campus main 30 se adhik bacchiyon ke saath balaatkaar kii khabar ko saamaanya khabar banaakar kinare kar rahaa tha
 Now such people will get relief from the court order
 unke sambandh daanv par nahin lagenge
 Therefore, a review of this decision is also necessary
 ek darshak or pathak ke taur par aap sochie
 Is this not stopping you? Would you not like to know exactly what happened in the case of rape of more than 30 girls in one campus? Why was SP transferred by CBI? Has the minister who resigned was not saved? Will that person be saved by weakening the case? Are you really under the illusion that this has stopped happening in India? If so, then you do one thing
 kal se akhbaar band kar dijie or news channel kaa conection katwa dijie
 Because nothing wrong is happening now
 jaanch angency par bharosa hi karnaa hoga
 What will you do by buying the newspaper if not reporting? kyon kareed rahe hai? In the case of Amit Shah's son Jai Shah, notice came from the court
 reporting band ho gai
 Now a new way has come
 manahani kaa
 People who have drowned in devotion have come to such an extent that they are saying that they are afraid of going to court
 kya unhen pataa he ki ambani ke saamne koi patrkaar kitne vakil lekar ja sakegaa? kya unhen nahin pataa he ki 5000 karod kaa daawa yaa 50 karod kaa daawa aise kitne reportron ko daraa degaa? aap apana paksh dijie na chape to alag baat he lekin jab aapkaa paksh dene par chap rahaa he to phir manahani ko hathiyaar kyon banaaya ja rahaa he? Where did we reach raajnneetik bhakthi ne is haal main laa diya he ki ham har azaadi khone ko sahi tehra rahe hai
 Such arguments are preparing you mentally to remain silent
 godi media aise hi janata ko chhod chukaa he
 For him, the audience or readers are just like surveys
 survey karne or waapas usee ko dikhaane ke
 If this disease was already in the media, is this the way to cure it? Or we don't want to fix? Comments koi jaakar un bacchiyon se sirf itnaa kah de ki ab is maamle main koi reporting nahin hogi
 Neither TV will see the news nor will it be printed in the newspaper
 ye aadesh hai court ne diya he to un bacchiyon par kya guzaregi
 Has not this order disarmed rape victims? Have you left these girls too? i am asking you aap jo ek darshak hai, ek pathak hai

 Muzaffarpur girl child scandal would not have happened in front of you today if the media had not exposed it
 mujhe print kii jaankaree nahin he, tivi main thodi bahut khabar sabane dikhaai lekin kashish news channel ne jis tarah se lagaataar is maamle ko ujagar kiya, wo na hota yah cond sibiai ke darvaaze tak nahin pahunchataa
 Probably not even to the court door
 court ko is baat kaa sangyaan lenaa chahie tha ki media kii vajah se hi yah jaghanya aparaadh saamne aayaa he
 Rape and sexual harassment of more than 30 girls in a campus is not a common occurrence
 balki baad main jab baaki media kii sakriyata badi tab or bhi kuch nae tathy saamne aate gaye
 Therefore, at least in this matter, from the court to the Bihar government, the media should be thankful
 court ko yah dhyaan rakhana chahie ki media kii khabaron ke kaaran hi ek kabina mantri ko pad se hatana padaa or sibai ne unke yahaan bhi chhapemari kii
 It is evident from the media's reporting that big people are engaged in suppressing this matter
 reporting se jaanch main madad hi milegi kyonki jaanch shuru hi hui he reporting ke kaaran
 The curbing of reporting will give rise to the suspicion that big people have made arrangements to save themselves
 bachaane kaa ek tarika cese ko taalte jane kaa bhi he
 If there is continuous reporting, new facts will be revealed and there will be pressure on the investigating agencies to appear before the court from time to time by taking their report
 balika grih cond kii reporting un bacchiyon ke bharose ke liye bhi he
 There will be constant threat to them
 koi dabaav daal saktaa he
 Many times the lives of the witnesses are threatened
 kya in sab ashankaon kii padtaal media ko nahin karnaa chahie, or apni khabaron ke zarie adaalat or samaaj ke saamne nahin laana chahie? un bacchiyon kaa koi maa-baap nahin he
 They are helpless to the poor people who are doing ash with the help of the power system
 is vakt media kii reporting hi unka sambal ho saktaa tha
 It is therefore important that the court review its decision
 is aadesh se media ke us tabake main khushi hi hogi jin par is cond kii tah tak jane or khabaron ko laane kaa dabaav pad rahaa tha
 Which by completing the formalities of reporting for a long time, bypassing the news of rape of more than 30 girls in a campus, was a normal news
 ab aise logon ko adaalat ke aadesh se raahat mil jaaegi
 Their relationship will not be at stake
 isliye bhi is faisle kii samiksha zaruri he
 Think of you as an audience and reader
 kya yah aap par roak nahin he? kya aap bilkul nahin jaananaa chahenge ki ek campus main 30 se adhik bacchiyon ke rape ke maamle main kya hua? sibiai kii taraf se jaanch kar rahe es pi kaa tabadalaa kyon hua? kahin istipha dene vaali mantri ko bachaa to nahin liya gaya? kahin cese kamazor kar us vyakti ko bachaa to nahin liya jayega? kya aap vaaki is bhram main hai ki bharat main yah sab hona band ho gaya he? agar aisa he to aap ek kaam kiijie
 Close the newspaper from tomorrow and cut off the connection of the news channel
 kyonki ab kuch galat hi nahin ho rahaa he
 Investigation agency has to be trusted
 reporting hogi nahin to akhbaar kareed kar aap kya karenge
 Why are you buying? amit shah ke bete jai shah ke maamle main bhi adaalat se notice aa gaya
 Reporting stopped
 ab ek nayaa tarika aayaa he
 Of defamation
 bhakthi main dub chuke log is had tak aa gaye hai ki kehane lage hai ki court jane se kya dar he
 Do they know how many lawyers a journalist can take in front of Ambani? Do they not know that a claim of 5000 crores or a claim of 50 crores will scare away many such reporters? If you do not give your favor, then it is a different matter, but when your favor is being printed, then why is defamation being made a weapon? ham kahaan se kahaan pahunch gaye
 Political devotion has brought in the condition that we are justifying losing every freedom
 is tarah ke tark aapako maansik rup se taiyaar kar rahe hai ki chupchaap ghulaam bane raho
 The dock media has left the public like this
 uske liye darshak yaa pathak sirf survey ke saamaan hai
 To survey and show the same back
 agar media main pehle se ye beemaari thi to kya yahi tarika he thik karne kaa? yaa ham thik karnaa hi nahin chaahate?tippaniyan Someone should go and tell those girls that there will be no reporting in this matter
 na tivi main khabar dikhegi na akhbaar main chhapegi
 If the High Court has given this order, then what will be passed on those girls
 kya is aadesh ne balaatkaar kii shikaar ladakiyon ko nihattha nahin kiya he? kya aapane bhi in ladakiyon kaa saath chhod diya he? main aapse puch rahaa hum

 One way to save is to avoid the case
 lagaataar reporting hogi to nae nae tathy saamne aaenge or jaanch agenciyon par dabaav rahegaa ki vah apni report lekar adaalat ke saamne samay samay par haazir hoti rahe
 The reporting of the girl child home scandal is also for the trust of those girls
 un par lagaataar khatara bana rahegaa
 One can exert pressure
 kai baar gavaahon kii jaan ko khatara ho jaataa he
 Shouldn't the media investigate all these fears, and bring them to the court and society through their news? Those girls do not have any parents
 ve satta tantra kii madad se aish kar rahe darindon ke aage laachaar hai
 At this time, media reporting could be their strength
 isliye zaruri he ki adaalat apane is faisle kii samiksha kare
 With this order, there will be happiness in the section of the media, who were under pressure to go to the bottom of this scandal and bring the news
 jo lambey samay tak reporting kii aupchaarikta puri kar ek campus main 30 se adhik bacchiyon ke saath balaatkaar kii khabar ko saamaanya khabar banaakar kinare kar rahaa tha
 Now such people will get relief from the court order
 unke sambandh daanv par nahin lagenge
 Therefore, a review of this decision is also necessary
 ek darshak or pathak ke taur par aap sochie
 Is this not stopping you? Would you not like to know exactly what happened in the case of rape of more than 30 girls in one campus? Why was SP transferred by CBI? Has the minister who resigned was not saved? Will that person be saved by weakening the case? Are you really under the illusion that this has stopped happening in India? If so, then you do one thing
 kal se akhbaar band kar dijie or news channel kaa conection katwa dijie
 Because nothing wrong is happening now
 jaanch angency par bharosa hi karnaa hoga
 What will you do by buying the newspaper if not reporting? kyon kareed rahe hai? In the case of Amit Shah's son Jai Shah, notice came from the court
 reporting band ho gai
 Now a new way has come
 manahani kaa
 People who have drowned in devotion have come to such an extent that they are saying that they are afraid of going to court
 kya unhen pataa he ki ambani ke saamne koi patrkaar kitne vakil lekar ja sakegaa? kya unhen nahin pataa he ki 5000 karod kaa daawa yaa 50 karod kaa daawa aise kitne reportron ko daraa degaa? aap apana paksh dijie na chape to alag baat he lekin jab aapkaa paksh dene par chap rahaa he to phir manahani ko hathiyaar kyon banaaya ja rahaa he? Where did we reach raajnneetik bhakthi ne is haal main laa diya he ki ham har azaadi khone ko sahi tehra rahe hai
 Such arguments are preparing you mentally to remain silent
 godi media aise hi janata ko chhod chukaa he
 For him, the audience or readers are just like surveys
 survey karne or waapas usee ko dikhaane ke
 If this disease was already in the media, is this the way to cure it? Or we don't want to fix? Comments koi jaakar un bacchiyon se sirf itnaa kah de ki ab is maamle main koi reporting nahin hogi
 Neither TV will see the news nor will it be printed in the newspaper
 ye aadesh hai court ne diya he to un bacchiyon par kya guzaregi
 Has not this order disarmed rape victims? Have you left these girls too? i am asking you aap jo ek darshak hai, ek pathak hai

 com / tgvemlph57 panchayat ajtak ke 'musalmaan ke man main kya he?' seshan main vaktaa the uttar pradesh sarkaar ke mantri ajam khan
 In this session, SP leader Azam Khan lashed out at the bjp's PM candidate Narendra Modi
 ajam khan ke kaha ki 2002 kaa gujarat yaad kiijie or sochie assam main pahunche bhi nahin the or khoonkhraba shuru ho gaya
 Azam Khan said, 'the country has been put in deficit for its own benefit
 isse rishton ko nuksaan hua he
 Before independence, when two people ate in a plate, it was not known who is Hindu and who is Muslim
 bharosa mitane se desh bantata he
 'looks like pm's chair Ajam Khan said while targeting Modi,' It seems that the Prime Minister's chair has been bought
 loktantr bhi kharid liya gaya he agar aisa hua to desh roega
 When Azam Khan was asked about the Muzaffarnagar riots, he said openly on Muzaffarnagar, "I have not been silent on Muzaffarnagar
 adaalaton ko ham nahin maanenge to aap hamen taanashaah kahenge
 i got 7 notices of the Supreme Court, i was told that i got rioted
 mere se zyada koun royaa hoga? mere se zyada kisko dard hua hoga? hatyaein dikhaai gayi, hatyare nahin
 They were shown burning houses, not burning houses
 balaatkaar dikhaae gaye balaatkaari nahin
 Also show what is not shown
 hamaari jimmedaari kii sajaa to hamen mil jaaegi
 When Azam Khan was asked why it was said that UP would not be allowed to become Gujarat
 to unhone palatakar sawaal kiya aisa kisne kaha
 After taking Netaji's name Azam Khan replied, 'you too are saying Netaji
 wo shaks aisa hi he
 Once you know the leader, you will not be able to get away from him
 'saifai par ajam khan kii safai
 
 
 When Azam Khan was asked about the Saifai festival, he turned the media over to the box
 ajam khan kaa jawaab tha, 'saifai kii baat kar rahe hai, mujffarnagar kii khabaren dikhaane vaale news ankar ne bhi mechap kiya hua tha
 His eyes were not moist
 netaa ji ke bare main main galat nahin sun saktaa hum, or aisa hi netaa desh par raaj karegaa
 Attack on Modi
 
 
 ajam khan ne kaha, 'bahut dooriyaan badha di gai hai
 The language which is spoken by a youth from 16 years to 40 years is unfortunate
 maukaparast logon kii vajah se aisa ho rahaa he
 Such people who get the photo of Lord Ram on the stage and give political speeches, only such people have increased these distances
 'main acha insaan hum
 
 
 Azam Khan also praised himself fiercely
 unhone kaha, 'main acha insaan hum or bahut acha dost hum
 The truth of Kargil hills is very sweet
 is sach ko jaanakar ham phir se ek-duusare se mohabbat karne lagenge
 'the Charlie Muslim Army' gave us the victory, my Hindu children will know if they won't love us
 'chunaav ayog par barase ajam khan
 
 
 Azam Khan said, 'the Election Commission rules have broken the law
 mujhase jawaab maanga gaya tha maine samay se pehle jawaab de diya tha lekin us jawaab ko padhe bina mujhe sajaa suna di gai
 The constitution is not a sky book
 25 hajaar logon ne jantar mantar par chunaav ayog ke khilaaf dharna diya he is baar
 'if Modi government comes, majority will also suffer
 
 
 
 Azam Khan said, 'it is not that only minorities will pay majority of the country
 kyonki is baar bijepi kii sarkaar nahin balki modi kii sarkaar hogi
 Remember Gujarat of 2002? His helicopter did not even land in Assam and violence erupted there
 'ajam khan se jab poocha gaya ki kya aane vaale samay main bas jakhmon ko kureda jayega to unhone kaha, 'unase puuchhie jo kehete hai pakistan chale jaao, ghar chhod do
 They say that Ganga Maiya called because she came, but Ganga got so far away from Maiya that she would not get splashed and her clothes should not be dirty
 '100 dangon kii baat akhilesh ne nahin kabuuli
 
 
 When Azam Khan was told that Akhilesh Yadav had confessed to 100 riots in the assembly, his reply was, 'akhilesh never accepted
 agar aap sabit kar denge to main kaan pakad kar maafee maang luungaa or agar sabit nahin kar paae to aap bol dijiega ki galati ho gai
 'tomorrow will be in the hands of corporate'
 
 
 adani kaa zikr karte hue ajam khan ne kaha, 'aane vaala kal corporate ke haathon main hoga
 You will not be able to call Maoists and Naxalites wrong
 16 may ke baad desh kii surat kya hogi pataa nahin
 It is not known whether the constitution will be there or not
 'upi main ham honge sabase bada dalajam khan ne kaha, 'uttar pradesh main ham sabase zyada siton par jeetenge
 There are no injuries except Muzaffarnagar
 or is jakhm kaa hamen ahsaas he
 We have gone there and said that not only do we realize your pain, we are also your sympathizers
 ' The Rajasthan Pradesh Congress Committee termed the Halla Bol program conducted by the state BJP on Wednesday as a ridiculous and flop show, instead of calling it a whisper campaign and calling it a busted cracker
 party pravaktaa dow
 Archana Sharma said that the absence of general public participation in this campaign of BJP shows that the absence of BJP leaders and mlas shows that their leaders are questioning the rationale of such campaigns
 unhone kaha ki pichley ek saal se congress sarkaar ke virodh main kaarykram, andolan evam abhiyaan chalaane kii bijepi kagaji ghoshnaayen hi karti rahi, har baar agle kaarykram kii tithiyaan evam vijyaptiyaan jari hoti rahi, lekin bijepi kabhi koi prabhavi kaarykram nahin kar pai
 Congress's Prince Rahul Gandhi feels that India is a computer, in which the program called 'by default' is lying
 unhone ati aatmavishvaas dikhaate hue kaha, 'agar bharat computer he to congress iskaa ‘difolt program’ he
 Addressing representatives of the state units of the party, NSUI and Youth Congress, Rahul said that the Congress is the core of the country
 'vipaksh ke propaganda par chup nahin rahen, uski kaat thos tathyon se karen: rahul'aise main jab narendra modi congress par lagaataar hamale kar rahe hai, rahul ne apni party ke logon ko salaah di ki yah desh gusse or aakraamakata ko pasand nahin karata
 He said, 'if India is a computer, then its' default program' is Congress
 congress bharat ke swabhaav ko prakat karti he
 Anger and aggression are not preferred here
 ' BJP MP Virender Singh gave a speech in Lok Sabha, BJP MP from up's Ballia Virender Singh, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP Virendra Singh Mast made a peculiar statement about the slowdown in the auto sector
 unhone guuruuvaar ko loksabhaa main kaha ki desh ko badnaam karne ke liye auto kshetra main mandi or bikri kam hone kii baaten kii ja rahi hai
 He questioned that if there is a slowdown in the auto sector then why there are many vehicles and road jams in each house? He said that an atmosphere of economic recession is being created in the country
 kaha ja rahaa he ki auto kshetra main kharid main kami ai he
 This is being done to discredit the country
 unhone sawaal kiya, 'agar auto kshetra main kharid kam hoti to sadakon par jam kyon he? aaj ek-ek ghar main kai gaadiyaan hai
 'what on farmers? Virender Singh raised the issue of farmers as well as surrounded the Congress in the winter session of Bollesand
 apane bhaashan ke dauraan vah kuch saansadon par mazaakia andaaj main tippanee karte bhi najar aae
 When Virendra Singh was giving a speech, an MP interrupted him
 jawaab main saansad virendra singh ne mazaakia andaaj main kaha ki tum baitho bhai
 
 
 i know you darasal, loksabhaa main niyam 193 ke tahat fasalon ke nuksaan or kisaanon par prabhaav par charchaa chal rahi thi
 During this, Virendra Singh said that whenever there are sessions, there is definitely discussion of farmers
 ye desh kisaanon kaa desh he or sansad bhi charchaa karaane ko vivash rahati he
 i think mps should have a consensus on the discussion of farmers to solve their problems
 or mujhe lagata he yahaan baithe sabase varisht saansad mulaayam singh is baat se sahamat honge ki kisaanon ke samasya ke samaadhaan ke liye saansad ekamat hota he
 He said that when there is discussion that a government is working to solve the problem of farmers, then people of other parties feel why this government works
 ye sarkaar vifal ho gai he usee par charchaa kendrit karte hai
 The problem does not arise in a day, the minister said that the problem of farmers has not arisen in a day
 or main shashan ke dal se saansad hum or daawey se kah saktaa hum ki ek din main samaadhaan bhi nahin hona he
 The problem of agriculture does not arise in a day, nor a solution is found in a day
 unhone modi sarkaar kii tarif kii or kaha ye sarkaar kisaanon ke liye kaam kar rahi he
 Taking a dig at the opposition, he said that you people do not talk to the farmers
 kitabon main kisaan padhate hai
 Farmers are also happy with this government
 virendra singh ne kaha ki is desh main ek daur main do tarah kekisanhue
 One who got 1 or 2 acres of land and one who got 20 acres
 virendra singh itnaa hi bol hi rahe the ki itane main ek saansad ne unako tokaa
 In response, Virender Singh asked him to sit down
 unhone kaha ki ye bahut vyakul ho jate hai
 have a seat
 
 
 baithiye
 
 
 Is not your subject

 Politics on water continues in Delhi, but now this politics has taken a new turn
 sari kii sari raajnneeti keval ek aam aadmi party vidhayak ke ird-gird aakar ruk gai he
 The name of this AAP MLA is Dinesh Mohaniya
 dinesh mohaniya dilli ke sangam vihaar se aam aadmi party (AAP) ke vidhayak hai or dilli jal board ke upaadhyaksh hai
 Union Minister for Consumer Affairs Ram Vilas Paswan is adamant that Dinesh Mohania should not be in the common team that is talking about forming a joint team to check water quality in Delhi
 ramvilas paswan ne guuruuvaar ko press conference kar kejariwal ko chunauti di or kaha 'ham chunauti dete hai siem kejariwal ko ki wo jaanch kara len
 We had spoken on the very first day to form a team of two people, out of which the Delhi government has named one MLA
 aakhir ek vidhayak ko lab kii kya jaankaree hoti he
 In fact, when the controversy over the investigation report of Bureau of Indian Standards increased in Delhi, on the suggestion of the Delhi Government, Union Consumer Affairs Minister Ram Vilas Paswan decided to conduct a water quality check with the joint team of the Central and Delhi Government
 ramvilas paswan ne centre sarkaar kii taraf se bhartiya maanak beuro ke mahanideshak or up mahanideshak ko saajha team ke liye namit kiya, to dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne dilli jal board ke upaadhyaksh dinesh mohaniya or dilli jal board ke sadsy shalab kumaar ko namit kiya
 On Wednesday, Ram Vilas Paswan objected to the name of Dinesh Mohania and said that there should be no expert or officer in this team, not a leader
 dinesh mohaniya sangam vihaar se aam aadmi party ke vidhayak hai isliye kejariwal ko inaki jagah kisi gaiyr raajnneetik naam ko is team main namit karnaa chahie
 But even 24 hours after Paswan said, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal did not give a second name, sending a message that the Delhi government is adamant on nominating Dinesh Mohania to the common team
 jabaki centre sarkaar is tark ke saath or gai he ki jaanch team main koi netaa nahin hona chahie
 On Thursday afternoon, Delhi Jal Board vice-president Dinesh Mohania told the press conference that the Delhi Jal Board has taken samples from all the 11 places from where the Bureau of Indian Standards had taken the samples and failed
 mohaniya ne bhartiya maanak beuro kii jaanch par sawaal uthaae or uski report ko khaarij kiya
 When Ram Vilas Paswan's comment was questioned to Mohania, Dinesh Mohania said, "we should focus on process and go on transparency rather than on the person in this matter
" jo bhi sample liye jaaen vah sab logon ke saamne ho unako thik tarah se sil kiya jaae
 They should have a proper procedure
 unako lab main bheja jaae or unke jo bhi nattejey aaen vah media ke saamne or janata ke saamne rakhe jaaen jisase janata khud tay kar sake ki pani saaf he yaa nahin' The nuclear-powered Agni-4 missile and the special operations aircraft C-130J were demonstrated for the first time at the Republic Day celebrations held on Thursday at Rajpath in Delhi

 ) dilli vidhansabha chunaav ko ek tarah se amit shah kaa chunaav kaha ja saktaa he kyonki pradhanmantri narendra modi ne bhi isamen thodi-si reliyon ko hi sambodhit kiya
 Hours before the end of the election campaign, Associate Editor Ravish Tiwari held talks with BJP President Amit Shah, who has been mired in the micromanagement strategy of the election
 unase hui baatcheet ke ansh:chunaav abhiyaan main kendriya mantriyon or itani badi sankhya main saansadon kaa sakriy hona kya is baat kaa sanket he ki party kii rajya ikai ke paas paryaapt sanghathanaatmak kshamta or dhaancha nahin he?media or khaskar aam aadmi party (aap) ek hi agenda par prachaar chalaa rahi he ki bijepi isliye itani kadi mehnat kar rahi he kyonki yahaan chunavi takkarkadi he, or desh bhar se aae hamaare kaaryakarta kadi mehnat isliye kar rahe hai kyonki sthaneey ikai sakriy nahin he
 But this is not true
 bijepi kaa har kaaryakarta har chunaav main itani hi kadi mehnat karata he
 We have set a target of getting 50 percent votes in these elections
 jab bhi kisi rajya main chunaav hota he, to duusare rajyon ke or us rajya ke kaaryakarta saath milakar kaam karte hai
 Each assembly constituency has two in-charge leaders
 isamen nayaa kuch nahin he
 But does not Kiran Bedi being fielded as the chief ministerial candidate indicate a lack of confidence in the state unit? Attempts are being made to form such an opinion but it is far from the truth
 to, aap maanate hai ki dilli ke halaat alag the?har rajya kii sthiti alag hi hoti he
 Arvind Kejriwal has complained about your print advertising campaigns
 bijepi ne isse pehle kab aisa vyaktigat hamale vaala abhiyaan chalaaya tha?hamane aisa hi vigyaapan abhiyaan loksabhaa chunaav, maharashtra or jharkhand main bhi chalaaya tha
 In Jharkhand, there was a similar campaign against the father-son government
 lekin aap media waalon kaa focus dilli par hi rahata he, duusare rajyon se simit jaankaree hi saamne aati he
 You said in a rally that victory in Delhi is necessary for victory in Bihar
 maine yah nahin kaha ki bihar main jeet yahaan kii jeet se judi he
 i had said that victory in Delhi would create a strong foundation for victory in Bihar
 vichaardhaara ke str par bijepi ke liye koun bada khatra he—aap yaa congress?aap kii to koi vichaardhaara hi nahin he
 After all, what is his ideology? It is not an ideology to collect some complaints and complaints
 is par aapaki kya pratikriya he ki bijepi vot to maangati he vikaas ke naam par lekin satta main aane ke baad 'ghar vaapasi' abhiyaan ko shah dene lagati he?pehali baat to yah ki 'ghar vaapasi' bijepi kaa program nahin he
 Secondly, there is no contradiction between 'homecoming' and development
 agar koi punardharmantaran karaata he to kya isse logon ko peyajal yaa bijli uplabdh karwaane main aadchan aati he? After the Delhi gang rape convicts were hanged, it was believed that there would be a decrease in such incidents in the country, but there is still a lot of courage for the poor

 Terming 'political interference' as essential in democracy, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday made it clear to the bureaucrats that they should not see it as an obstacle to good governance
 raajnneetik hastkshepaur anuchit hastkshep ke bich antar spasht karte hue modi ne kaha ki inamen se ek vyavastha ke liye ‘anivaary or aprihaary’ he vahiin duusare se vyavastha ‘nasht’ ho jaaegi
 Addressing civil service officials, Modi said that bureaucratic mood and political interference are often discussed as an impediment in the advancement of the democratic process
 unhone kaha, ‘loktantr main, naukarshahi or raajnneetik hastkshep saath saath chalate hai
 This is typical of democracy
 agar hamen is desh ko chalaanaa he, to hamen anuchit raajnneetik hastkshep kii jarurat nahin he
 But political intervention is inevitable and inevitable, otherwise democracy will not work
 ’ unhone kaha ki loktantr main raajnneetik hastkshep kii jarurat he kyonki logon ko janpratinidhiyon se ummiden hoti hai
 Modi said that words like obstruction and difficulty need to be removed from the bureaucratic system
 unhone civil sarvice diwas samaaroh main kaha, ‘ek vibhaag kaam kar rahaa he lekin kahin or ise roak diya jaataa he
 You will question what happened? It would say that this is a bureaucratic way of doing things
 usee prakaar agar kuch kaam kahin atak jaataa he to ham kehete hai ki yah raajnneetik hastkshep he
 Emphasizing accountability and responsibility, Modi told the officials that every problem has to be resolved and it has to be discovered
 unhone kaha ki sushasan ke liye javabdehi, jimmedaari or paardarshita aavashyak he
 a smartphone that is cheaper than the price of a packet cigarette
 ringing bels ne 'freedom 251' ke naam se jo smartphone launch kiya, uskaa ofer price kisi sapane kii tarah he
 Nobody believes this price from the telecom world to the business world
 lekin ab teen maheene ke bheetar 50 lakh phone kii delivery honi he
 What is the truth? Is this a new product to revolutionize the Indian telecom industry? Or is it a Ponzi scam? Or that the truth is hidden elsewhere? The special investigative team of Aaj Tak has solved the mystery
 'freedom 251'ke sach ke pataa lagane ke liye hamaari team ne oparation kii shuruyaat kii dilli ke kirti nagar main sthit adcom company ke daftar se
 Let us tell you that Adcom or Advantage Communication is a manufacturer and distributor of mobile phones and tablets
 ringing bels ne adcom se kharida phone!hamaari team adcom ke maalik sanjeev bhaatia se milti he
 Bhatia told us that the phone which the ringing bells are making big claims on television channels, claiming that they were bought from Adcom
 vah kehete hai, 'dekhie hamaare paas order aayaa, hamane usko maal diya
 We definitely took money in lieu of this, because there was no interaction between us earlier
 yah sab launch se kareeb 2-3 din pehle hua
 By then, we did not know that FREEDOM 251 was anything
 'bhaatia ne aage kaha ki unhone hephone ko supplai kiyaahai
 Not only this, he said, 'if you want, you can see our whole unit
 hamaari factory main iskaa production chal rahaa he isi model kaa
 If you want to go, i can get you to visit my factory
 hamane sirf panel kharida: ringing belsadcom ke daavon kii jaanch karne hamaari team ab noida ke sector 63 sthit ringing bels ke daftar pahunchati he
 When we asked the President of Ringing Bells, Ashok Chadha, in the claim of Adcom, he immediately came on the defensive
 chaddha ko ye maananaa padaa ki phone duusari company se kharida gaya tha
 But still he insisted that only the panel was purchased from Adcom, while the rest of the phone is assembled by ringing bells
 jab 'aaj tak' ne or kureda to ringing bels ko maananaa padaa ki phone unka nahin he
 But he also claimed that only the touch plate was purchased from elsewhere, while the rest of the phone was enabled here
 haalanki is daawey par bhi adcom ne sawaal khadey kar die
 'real Name is Icon-4 White' Sanjeev Bhatia of ADCOM told us that the matter is not just one part, but the entire phone was purchased from Adcom
 bhaatia ke mutabik 'freedom 251' vastav main 'ikon-4 white' he
 According to Bhatia, the ringing bells erased the icon name of the icon-4 from the panel and affixed its sticker
 adcom kaa daawa he ki usne ringing bels ko 3600 rupee main prati smart phone bechaa tha
 Sanjeev Bhatia said, 'this is cheating and if we do some damage, then definitely we will drag them to court
 legal ection lenge
 Opening the mobile, you will see the IMEI number inside
 
 
 bydaree hamaari hi he
 The cover is mounted on top of it
 ye hamaari bydaree he uske upar steekar yaa cover chadhaaya he
 How is a 3600 phone in 251? Actually it is like a puzzle that how a company is going to buy a mobile for Rs
 3600 and sell it in the market for Rs
 251? The statement by the owner of Adcom has raised serious questions over the claims of ringing bells
 to kya ringing bels sirf bhram kaa gubbaaraa uda rahaa he yaa phir iske peeche kuch or he?do companiyon ko diya he assembling kaa jimmaringing bels ne hamen bataaya ki 'freedom 251' mobile phone kii assembling ke liye company ne dilli ke paas do or mumbai ke paas ek production unit ko jimmaa saunpa he
 These companies are y Technology and Imminence Technology
 ringing bels management ne hamen ye bhi bataaya ki wo 251 rupee ke phone kii 50 lakh unit kaa order pehle hi de chuke hai
 The company claims that the sale of the phone will begin in June this year
 abhi tak assembling shuru karne kii ijaajat nahin50 lakh phone kaa nirmaan kaary kaisaa chal rahaa he? ye jaanane ke liye ham sabase pehle eminance technology ke daftar greater noida pahunche
 Here we met Nidhi Khullar, the company's director
 nidhi ne khulaasa kiya ki dhamaakedaar lonching se mahaj paanch din pehle ringing bels ne unase sampark saadhaa tha
 Nidhi also told that till now she has not even got the green signal from ringing bells to start assembling
 iske baad ham vaai technology ke bijness head prabhuprit singh se milane dilli ke janakapuri pahunche
 He also informed that production of Rs 251 phone has not started yet
 90 din main 50 lakh phone, lekin kaise?aisa mana jaataa he ki donon production unit ko nabbe dinon main 50 lakh phone kaa utpaadan karnaa he
 While the work of assembling has not even started yet
 ringing bels ne ab tak kisi graahak kaa paisa nahin maaraa he
 The company says that the cash will be collected at the time of delivery
 lekin 'aaj tak' kii jaanch se saaf he ki graahakon ko 'freedom 251' ke nirmaataaon ke lambey-chaude daavon se saavdhaan rahane kii jarurat he
 What the critics say: After the colorful launch of the past few days, the management team of Ringing Bells Company was in our studio to explain how indigenous manufacturing will make the price of smart phones very cheap
 lekin ringing bels ke daavon par telecom udyog kii tikhi pratikriya ai
 The Indian Cellular Association even ridiculed 'freedom 251'

 htm If someone earns in thousands and wealth in billions, it is not difficult to understand the case
 upi police or idi ne ek aise eartio ko pakadaa he, jise log purvanchal ke yadav singh ke naam se jaanate the
 a face of black money, which has the wealth of billions due to just one government job
 uski kaali kamai ke raaj har kisi ko chaunkaa rahaa he
 Of late, the hands of the law finally reached the dilemma of the government officer whom the government had deployed to protect the laws, but by protecting the laws, he himself broke the law and broke such black money
 Banita sat, whose government is now surprised to see his empire
 ares yadav
 ARTO, Chandauli
 'kaali kamai kaa dhankuber'
 Yes, this is its name
 yahi ohada he is shaks kaa
 But under the guise of this position, this man named RS Yadav has a charge of black money of Arabs in a few years, which is in the hands of the police and the Enforcement Directorate in the face of his immense wealth in different cities
 balki ab to haalat ye he ki eartio ares yadav kii sampatti kahaan se shuru ho kar kahaan khatm hoti he, iskaa sahi-sahi hisaab philhal kisi ke paas nahin
 But broadly, the officers investigating the actions of the ARTO say that it has also been found near the hotel in Benaras, malls in Gorakhpur, luxurious houses and a fleet of Volvo buses
 ab sawaal ye he ki akhir ye eartio aisa kya karata tha, jisase usne raaton-raat itane rupee kama liye? akhir uske bhrashtachar kaa tareeqa kya tha? or akhir wo ab tak pakadaa kyon nahin gaya? ares yadav kii jaanch karanevaale afasaron kaa kahana he ki apane mahakme ke mulaazimon kii madad se bihar upi ke chandauli border par baqayada vasuuli gang chalaa rahaa tha
 He used to stop trucks coming to UP in the name of overloading and used to charge 7 to 15 thousand rupees from each truck
 is tarah wo saalon se har rose lakhon rupee kama rahaa tha
 Even complaints were made against him many times before, but previous governments have always ignored these complaints
 lekin maamla aage badhata rahaa
 According to the police, this time when he received a complaint of illegal recovery in Chandauli, he arrested some of the Transport Department's red handed hands
 jab unase poochtacha hui to vasuuli ke taar iske kingpin eartio ares yadav tak ja pahunche
 He was later arrested by the police from near Jaunpur
 haalanki wo ab bhi khud ko bekasoor bataa rahaa he
 People who have fallen prey to RS Yadavki say that since he has been giving his black share to many politicians for a long time, he has never been caught before
 aise main ab dekhnaa he ki jaanch kahin ares yadav ke aakaaon tak bhi pahunchati he yaa phir yaheen khatm ho jaati he
 The investigation is on
 gujarat kii siyaasi ranbhumi main bispi pramukh mayawati puri takat ke saath utar rahi hai
 But with the help of Dalit votes, the Congress has been trumpeted to wipe out the wishes of Mayawati desperate to establish her roots in Gujarat
 gujarat main dalit andolan se nikle yuva netaa jignesh mewaani ko congress ne gale laga liya he
 Jignesh has also announced to support the Congress in the Gujarat Assembly elections
 is daanv ke sahare congress gujarat main bispi ke paas jo siyaasi jamaapunji he usamen bhi sendhamari karne kii jugat main he
 Due to this, Mayawati's aspirations wane and her political game seems to be deteriorating
 gujarat main dalit-adivasibispi ko bhale hi abhi tak ke gujarat main hue vidhansabha chunaavon main ek bhi seat hasil nahin hui he, lekin chunaav ladane ke uske utsaah main koi kami nahin ai he
 This time too, the BSP has decided to contest the 182 seats of Gujarat with full force
 gujarat main bispi kii jamaapunjibiespi ne 2002 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main apane 34 ummidavaar maidan main utaare the, jisamen se koi bhi jeet nahin sakaa tha
 0 to BSP in 2002
 32 fisadi vot mili the
 In the 2007 assembly elections, the BSP fielded 166 candidates and all had to face defeat
 haalanki party ko apana vot share badhaane main jarur kamyaabi mili, use 2
 It got 62 percent of the vote
 2012 main bispi 163 vidhansabha siton par ladi use 1
 Got 25 percent of the vote
 yani 2007 kii tulana main bispi ko nuksaan kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 The 40 reserved seats in Gujarat are 7 percent Dalit voters in Gujarat, while 11 percent are tribal
 gujarat main dalit or adivasee samaaj ke liye 182 vidhansabha siton main se 40 siten surakshit he
 Of these, 13 are for Dalit and 27 for tribal society
 pichley chunaav main dekha jaae to dalit siton par bijepi kaa dabadabaa tha
 Of the 13 seats, BJP won 10 and Congress won 3
 adivasee siton par congress ne jeet darj kii thi
 Of the 27 tribal seats, 16 were won by Congress and 10 by BJP
 dalit andolan se badla samikarnanational krime records beuro kii saal 2015 kii report ke mutabiq, anusuchit jati ke logon par hone vaale atyaachaar, jisamen gambhir chotein ai hon, aise maamalon main gujarat desh main duusare number par he
 Gujarat is constantly facing harassment cases
 bataa den aapako ki oona main dalit yuvakon kii pitayee ko lekar gujarat main andolan khadaa ho gaya tha, jiskaa netritv jignesh mewaani ne kiya tha
 It was through this movement that Jignesh got recognition in the country and he has emerged as the biggest face of Dalits in Gujarat
 jignesh kaa congress ke samarthan karne se gujarat kaa siyaasi sameekaran badla he
 In such a situation, the Congress has got a chance to make its place among the Dalit community
 isse bijepi ke saath-saath bispi ko bhi jhatka mana ja rahaa he
 Dalit thinker and Delhi University professor Ratan Lal believes that Congress will benefit from Jignesh's departure
 jignesh se congress ko phayda: binkehamdabaad main daliton ke utthan ke liye kaam karne vaali binaa kaa kahana he ki gujarat main dalit voter bahut nirnayak nahin he
 This is the reason why his condition is quite pathetic
 gujarat main raajnneetik dalon ke agenda main kabhi dalit nahin rahe hai
 But the Una incident has shaken the country
 is andolan se jignesh mewaani kii dalit samudaay main majboot pakad bani he
 In such a situation, Congress will benefit from their support of Congress
 bispi ko hoga nuksaan: sumnambedkarwaadi adivasee vichaarak sunil kumaar suman ne kaha ki gujarat main dalit chehre ke rup main jignesh mewaani kii ek pahchaan ban chuki he
 Even though he may not have come out of the Ambedkarite movement, Jignesh Mevani has made his mark through the Dalit movement in Gujarat
 gujarat main vah bahut bada cheharaa nahin hai, lekin jo bhi hai vahi hai
 It is true that their base is not in the whole of Gujarat, but there is a lot around Una
 unhone kaha ki mayawati ko swatantra chunaav nahin ladanaa chahie
 Mayawati has neither land nor mass base in Gujarat
 jabaki jignesh gujarat main daliton kii aawaaj ban chukaa he, logon ke dukh dard main shaamil ho rahaa he
 If the Congress gets good returns for supporting Jignesh Congress, then the BSP will suffer

 uttarakhandamen bakrii swayamvar ko lekar do mantriyon ke bich raar than gai he
 This swayamvar is to take place on 23 and 24 February
 bakrii swayamvar ke mudde par paryaton evam samskruti mantri satpal maharaj or pashupaalan rajya mantri rekha arya lagbhag aamane-saamne aa gaye hai
 Urban Development Minister Madan Kaushik is seen standing with Satpal Maharaj in this matter
 darasal yah swayamvar dhanolti main ek enjio ne yojit kiya he
 Minister of State for Animal Husbandry Rekha Arya has been called as the chief guest at the event
 rekha arya isamen hissaa lenaa chaahati hai
 It is not that this event is being held here for the first time
 sthaneey sanstha kotvillage pehle se hi yah aayojan kar rahi he
 The organization argues that the goats of the improved breed are brought and self-cultivated, which produces the best quality goats
 ab isamen sabase bada pench yah he ki prastaavit swayamvar vaidic mantrocchar ke saath hona he
 The same thing was lost to Tourism and Culture Minister Satpal Maharaj
 unka tark he ki mantroccharan ke bich bakriyon kaa byaah karaayaa janaa vaidic reeti rivaajon kii khilli udaana he
 Satpal Maharaj was not limited to criticism only
 unhone pashupal rajya mantri rekha arya kii us press conference ko bhi radd kar diya jiskaa aayojan bakrii swayamvar main rekha arya ke shirkat karne kii soochna dene ke liye kiya janaa tha
 Now the decision of the Chief Minister! The matter increased so much that barring development works and important issues, the goat swayamvar became the issue of the meeting of the state cabinet
 itnaa hi nahin bakrii swayamvar main mantroccharan hoga yaa nahin yah faisla mukhyamantri ke supurd kar diya gaya
 The Urban Development Minister also agreed with the Tourism and Culture Minister, Madan Kaushik, the Government Spokesperson and Tourism Development Minister Satpal Maharaj, while talking to the media after the cabinet's meeting with the Minister of Tourism and Culture
 unhone kaha ki pashupaalan ko badhaava dene ke liye bakriyon kaa swayamvar acchhee yojana he
 But Vedic mantras should not be chanted on such an occasion
 lekin is masale par jahaan ek ore mantrocchar ke saath bakrii swayamvar karne kii baat ko samskruti ke khilaaf mana ja rahaa he to duusari taraf kai tark iske paksh main bhi aa rahe hai
 There is also a solid argument in favor! The first argument in favor of the goat swayamvar is that in the Vedas and mythological religious texts, the Matsya avatar, Kachhap avatar, Shukra avatar, Varaha avatar, Srihari Vishnu are worshiped as avatars
 phir yah bhi tark aayaa ki pratham poojaneey bhagwaan ganesh ke sir par bhi hathi kaa mastak he
 Similarly, the goat's head was also placed to Lord Shiva's father-in-law and Sati's father Daksha
 daksh ne us mukh se shiv kii aradhana kii thi, to log puch rahe hai ki bakrii apavitra kahaan se ho gai
 Animal Husbandry Minister gave a sharp reply The Minister of State for Animal Husbandry is hurt by this protest but does not give up
 pichley dinon rudki main rekha arya ne media ke sawaal karne par ishaaron hi ishaaron main satpal maharaj kii apatti kaa uttar bade hi vyangyatmak dhang se diya
 Rekha Arya asked, "the parrot bird cries rama-rama
 He should ask the name of Rama to be asked by someone?" unhone kaha ki main kisi kaa virodh to nahin karti lekin kisi cheez se acha badlaav ho saktaa he to use kisi virodh se rokane ke paksh main bhi nahin hum
 Animal Husbandry Minister announced that his department will participate in organizing goat swayamvar on 23 and 24 in the state
 is syavanyar kaa makasad he, khasisamen bakrii paalan kii jaankariyon ko pashupalkon tak pahunchane ke saath-saath pashupaalan ko badhaava die jane kii koshish hoti he
 In this swayamvar, a variety of animals are also brought and animal fair is organized

 While more than a week has passed since Sidhu's resignation became public
 iske baad bhi captain ne abhi tak istife ko sweekaar nahin kiya he
 In such a situation, the question is why the captain is not able to take any decision yet
 darasal captain amarinder singh abhi tak siddhu ke istife ko lekar asamanjas kii sthiti main hai
 Due to this, Captain has reached Chandigarh from Delhi
 mukhyamantri captain amarinder singh ne dilli main media se baat karte hue kaha tha ki vah chandigarh jaakar siddhu ke istife ko padhenge or uske baad hi us par koi faisla lenge
 The Chief Minister has returned from Delhi to Chandigarh late Wednesday evening
 iske baad bhi abhi tak kisi tarah kaa faisla nahin liya
 In fact, on June 6, CM Captain Amarinder Singh reshuffled the cabinet and took the responsibility of the Ministry of Energy and Renewables to take the local body and tourism department from Sidhu
 iske do din baad siem ne sarkaar kii mahatvapurn yojanaon kii niyamit samiksha ke liye kuch samitiyaan gathit kin, lekin kisi bhi main siddhu ko jagah nahin di gai
 Sidhu was angered by the change of department and he had not taken up his job even after more than a month had passed
 iske baad siddhu ne twit karke istife kii jaankaree di thi
 His resignation, posted on Twitter, is dated June 10, addressed to the chairman of the All India Congress Committee
 isamen likhaa he ki vah punjab cabinet main mantri ke pad se istipha de rahe hai or unhone punjab siem captain amarinder singh ko bhi apana istipha bheja diya he
 There was increasing pressure on Sidhu to either take over or resign
 vipakshi dal to hamale bol hi rahe the, sarkaar ke mantriyon ne bhi kahana shuru kar diya tha ki siddhu ko ab kaarybhaar sanbhaalanaa chahie
 After this, he made his resignation public

 ) The Central Government may be claiming to promote the level of education in the country and work on free education, but the figures released by the Ministry are presenting a different picture
 centre sarkaar ne kaha he ki bacchon ko free or anivaary shiksha kanoon 2009 kaa dayera badhaane kaa koi prastaav nahin he
 According to the document issued by the government, there is no proposal under consideration to increase the scope of compulsory education from nursery to secondary
 samachar agency bhashaa ke anusaar, maanav sansaadhan rajya mantri satyapal singh ne rajyasabha ko ek sawaal ke likhit jawaab main bataaya ki is uddeshy ke liye centre kii ore se pryojit teen yojanaon kaa vilay kiya gaya he
 He has also said that there is no proposal to expand the scope of the Right to Education Act

 The Minister said that this scheme has been made by combining Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan and Teacher Education Scheme
 RSS ne kaha, praathmik shiksha keval bhartiya bhashaaon main honi chahiebta den ki rhite tu ajukeshan 2009 ke anusaar sabhi bacchon ko nursery kaksha se 8veen kaksha tak free or anivaary shiksha lene kaa adhikaar he
 At the same time, Uttar Pradesh government can also offer free education till 12th

 Let me tell you, the charge of murder in 2005 was on five people including BSP MLA Mukhtar Ansari, Munna Bajrangi and many others
 isamen se munna bajrangi kii beete dinon jail main hatya kar di gai thi
 Special Judge Arun Bhardwaj was hearing this case
 bijepi vidhayak krishnanand raay kii 29 november 2005 ko hatya kar di gai thi
 The case was transferred from Ghazipur in Uttar Pradesh to Delhi Court
 2013 main vidhayak krishnanand raay kii patni alka raay ne supreme court main yachika daakhil kii thi
 There are dozens of cases against Mhow MLA Mukhtar Ansari
 in maamalon main hatya or murder ke cese bhi shaamil hai
 Rai, the then BJP MLA from Muhammadabad assembly seat in Ghazipur, UP, was gunned down on 29 November 2005 when he was returning after inaugurating a cricket tournament in a village called Sayari
 is hamale main krishnanandar raay samet 7 logon kii maut hui thi
 Krishnanand Rai was considered very close to Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) veteran Manoj Sinha
 us vakt bhartiya janata party ke netaa aropiyon kii giraftaar ke liye dharne par baithe the
 The case was transferred to the CBI in 2006
 vyaapman se jude kaagaj kuch kaagaj ko enditivi ke haath lage bataa rahe hai ki madhya pradesh police ne is ghotaale main rajya ke governor ram naresh yadav ko aaropee number 10 banaaya tha, lekin sanvaidhanik chhot ke chalate na to unase poochtacha ho pai or na hi unhen giraftaar kiya gaya
 Police sources are also stating that the other accused in this case were arrested by the police and sent to jail
 vahiin, enditivi se khaas baatcheet main rajya ke mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ne daawa kiya tha ki is maamle main kisi ko bhi bachaaya nahin ja rahaa he
 Law is treating all people from small to big
 pichley saal madhya pradesh police ne rajyapal or unke bete ko is maamle main aaropee banaaya tha
 Both of them were accused of taking money from people and getting them admitted to government colleges
 yah aarope vyaapman ghotaale kii jaanch kar rahi estf ne apni jaanch main lagaae
 In this case, the Madhya Pradesh High Court had also stayed the inquiry of the Governor in an order
 court ne is maamle samvidhan kaa hawala diya
 At the same time, in March, the Governor's son Shailesh Yadav died
 vah lakhanu main apane awaas par mrit paaya gaya
 The police made the governor and his son an accused after the revelation of an arrested accused, Virpal Singh
 exiaar ke mutabik virpal ne jaanch main bataaya ki kareeb 10 logon ko teacher kii naukari main bhartee karaane ke liye rajyapal ke bete ko teen lakh rupee nakad die the
 This money was given at the governor's official residence
 virpal kaa yah bhi kahana tha ki shailesh kaam karne main naakaam rahe the
 The comments jab se bijepi satta main ai he tab se tamaam rajyapalon ko yaa to kisi bahaane hataaya gaya he yaa phir tabadalaa kar diya, lekin ram naresh yadav ke maamle main rajya or centre main bijepi ke hone ke baad bhi inhen nahin hataaya gaya
 The Congress has also attacked the government in this matter
 guuruuvaar ko supreme court main is maamle par sunwaayee hogi ki rajyapal ko hataaya ja saktaa he yaa nahin
 Last year, the Madhya Pradesh police made the governor and his son an accused in the case
 in donon par logon se paisa lekar sarkari collejon main daakhila dilwaaye jane ke aarope lage
 The STF investigating the Vyapam scam made these allegations in its investigation
 is maamle main madhya pradesh hoicourt ne ek aadesh main rajyapal se poochtacha par bhi roak laga thi
 The court cited the case constitution
 vahiin, march main rajyapal ke bete shailesh yadav kii maut ho gai
 He was found dead at his residence in Lucknow
 police ne rajyapal or unke bete ko ek giraftaar aaropee virpal singh ke khulaas ke baad aaropee banaaya tha
 According to the FIR, Virpal told in the investigation that the Governor's son had been given three lakh rupees in cash to get about 10 people admitted to the teacher's job
 yah paisa rajyapal ke sarkari awaas par diya gaya tha
 Virpal also said that Shailesh had failed to work

 The matter will be heard in the Supreme Court on Thursday whether the governor can be removed or not

 tantra mantra karwaane ke aarope par shivpal yadav bole ki dekhe tantra mantra yah mujhako aata nahin he, main isamen vishwaas nahin karata hum

 About the break up of the party, Shivpal Yadav says that we are with Netaji, whatever decision we take, we are with Netaji
 shivpal yadav bole ki aage bhi sab thik hoga he
 SP leader Naresh Agrawal along with majority Ram Gopal said that Mulayam Singh Yadav's letter regarding removal of Ram Gopal Yadav ji from the post of leader in Rajya Sabha is unfortunate, if the leader had taken the opinion of us mps, he would have known that he believed in majority It is said that Ram Gopal Yadav is the only leader

 ) For four years, black money has destroyed the lives of us Indians
 andolan par andolan, daawey par daawey or na jane kitni kaalikh is kaledhan ne failaai he
 Today Indian Express newspaper has brought new data, according to which 25 thousand crores rupees of 1195 Indians are deposited in Swiss banks
 iske baad kaledhan par bahes tej ho jaaegi
 But before making a noise, consider one thing - the newspaper has not used the word black money in any place in bold letters
 haa, ek jagah mote aksharon main itnaa jarur likhaa he ki is khulaase se kaledhan par bani esaity ke kaam kaa dayera bad jayega
 Well, in the future, our illusion is broken that it is black money, before that what is the harm in calculating a rough account
 agar yah 25 hajaar karod kii puri rakam bhi sarkaar ek jatke main waapas le aae to bhi har aadmi ko 200 ru hi mil paaenge
 This is far less than the attractive amount of 15 lakhs that Narendra Modi used to describe as an aspirant for the post of Prime Minister
 yah rakam itani kam he ki do din kii manaregaa kii dihadi bhi isse zyada banati he
 That is, if this wealth is also black then it is much less than the treasure of political enemies
 lekin is lekhak ko bahut andeh he ki yah dhan kaala sabit ho paaegaa
 The depositors and the tax collectors have put it so fair and lovely that a large part of it will be found legal
 masalan desh ke sabase bade dhannaseth bandhuon mukesh or anil ambani ke naam par swiss bank main 164-164 karod rupye dikhaae ja rahe hai
 The spokesperson of Bade Ambani has said on the injury of Danke that Ambani saheb does not have an illegal bank account in any corner of the world
 chote ambani ke pravaktaa ne khaataa hone se hi inkaar kar diya he
 Naresh Goyal, the founder chairman of Jet Airways, has sent a comment that he is a non-resident Indian, what to take from his law here
 kuch raison ne kaha he ki ve maamla pehle hi bharat main uchit kanoonee prakriyaaon ke jariye settle kar chuke hai
 They have also paid their fine
 khate main jo rakam he vah kanoonee he
 Dhannaseths not included in the list will also issue such statements soon
 ve aisa kar sakate hai kyonki unhone paisa bank main jamaa kiya he, kisi tahkhaane main chipa kar nahin rakhaa he
 The bank is also formed under the laws of the country in which it is formed
 jo bank antarrashtriya str par paisa jamaa kar rahaa he vah antarrashtriya kanoonon se bandhaa hota he
 The money deposited there is also under the purview of these laws
 yani agar yah paisa kaala bhi he to tamaam aarthik kanoonon ne ise bahut had tak safed kar diya he
 In such a situation, even if India takes very strict action, it will be like that police action in which the murder and kidnapping scandal will have tea with Daroga ji and the minor clowns who cannot even get bail will be in jail
 jab ham desh ke bheetar ke kaledhan ko nahin pakad pate to baahar se dhan kya khaak laaenge
 Anyway, in the name of defaulters in Indian banks, a government has been able to make public in the country till date
 ye baaten ghor nirashaavadi lag rahi hon to yah soch kar dekhie ki list main shaamil sab logon ko sarkaar ne kaledhan kaa chor maan liya or adaalat unhen jail bhej rahi he
 These will be the people who are said to be the backbone of your economy, they will be the people whose greatest leaders enjoy photographing smiles with their families, they will be those people who are fond of cricket matches, these are the people With whose money movies are made, these are the people from whom the entire non-government market of the country runs
 to aise main inhen jab hathkadi lagegi or ve kahenge ki acha agar ham chor hai to kal se ham kaarobaar band karte hai
 What will happen then sari sarkaar or vipaksh haath jod kar khadaa ho jayega ki hujur aisa gajab na kariye desh kaa kaarobaar band ho jayega
 Even if the court decrees, governments will have no choice but to ignore it
 vaise bhi pichley loksabhaa chunaav main jis kadar kaledhan kaa prayog hua he, vaise main kis netaa kii himmat he ki apane bhamashah ko hathkadi laga de
 If Kalyugi Bhamashah was handcuffed, would he not open his diaries in the court which would contain details of the black money donated to the leaders
 yani desh ek khulaa hamaam ban jayega, jahaan lakhon ke suut bhi kisi kaa tan nahin dhak paaenge
 This is a very cruel truth
 lekin hamen iske saath jeena sikh lenaa chahie
 And if we do not want to learn to live with it, then we should demand from our governments to make laws that are practical according to the current economy
 atiadarshavaadi kanoon ke lihaaj se to aapke muhalle main chalane vaali parchun kii dukaan bhi gaiyrkanoonee he or usase bina bill ke ek packet doodh lekar aap bhi kaledhan ko badhaava de rahe hai
 Therefore, if you want to agitate, do it for practical arrangements and not for the obsessive issue of black money
 is tarah ke mudde vipaksh ko satta main aane kaa mauka to de sakate hai, lekin aam aadmi ko tarakkee kaa rasta nahin
 Just think, in the last four years, the flood of agitations had tied the hands of the central government, business in the country was starting to get mired, officers' pen had stopped and your salary and property prices were frozen
 apni tarakkee chahie, to kuch din ke liye kranti bhul jaaiye, bhale hi yah kitni hi mohak avadharana ho
 Or give such revolution a break of at least 5 years
 isiilie is baar sansad main jab kaledhan par hangaamaa ho to isamen shaamil hone se pehle soch lijie ki is manoranjan main aapkaa phayda he bhi yaa nahin

 samar par samar fatah karti ja rahi bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) madhya pradesh ke nagar nikaay chunaav ke nateezon ke baad shaayad main kuch kasamasaahat main aae
 In Madhya Pradesh's municipal elections, the Congress has given a tough fight to the BJP and the contest has come down to par
 donon partiyon ko 9-9 siten mili hai
 One seat has gone to the account of independents
 bhaajapa ke liye yah koi acchhee khabar nahin he
 Especially in the election year
 is soobe main asantosh kii vajah kya he? khaskar, kisaanon ke bich gusse kii vajah ko jaananaa behad jaruri he
 In the last few years, the image of Madhya Pradesh has been that of a better performing state in the field of agricultural production
 yahaan rajya sarkaar ne sinchai kaa rakabaa badhaane main bhi joardaar kaam kiya
 Yet why is the farmer sad and disappointed? The peasant-friendly image of the state began to be shaken from the month of June last year, when the peasants' movement in Mandsaur came down
 police ne andolnarat kisaanon par golibari bhi kii thi
 It is not wrong to assume that farming in India is going through its worst phase and it has given a blow to the rural economy
 jaahir he, krishi or kisaanon kii samasya ab siyasat ke centre main he
 It was because of these agricultural problems that the BJP lost the rural seats in the Gujarat assembly elections
 ab madhya pradesh ke nikaay chunaavon main ausat pradarshan se bhaajapa yah sochane ke liye majaboor hogi ki shivaraj singh chouhan ke lagaataar teen baar ke kaarykaal se sattavirohi rujhaan se nipatna ek chunauti to he hi, gramin arthvyavastha ko lage jatke ke baad gramin vot sanbhale rakhana bhi ahm he
 Madhya Pradesh has about 72 percent rural votes
 ek aankada bataata he ki 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main 49 fisad se adhik kisaanon ne endie ko vot diya tha
 Also, the NDA got the vote of one third landless sharecroppers
 inhen voton ke dam par shivaraj singh chouhan pichley do chunaavon main satta-virdohi rujhaan ko thaamne main kaamyaab rahe the
 But they have to remember that out of the 230 seats in Madhya Pradesh Assembly, there were at least 60-70 seats where the BJP won by a small margin
 2013 ke vidhansabha chunaav ke lihaaj se ilakaur tareeke se agar bhaajapa or congress ke siton ko dekhen to yah antar saaf dikh jayega, jahaan bhaajapa ko maamuli badhat mili thi
 It will also be clear how North Malwa was established as a strong stronghold of BJP
 2013 main bhaajapa ko kul 165, congress ko 58 or anya ko 7 siten mili thim
 There are a total of 34 assembly seats in the Chambal area of madhya Pradesh where the BJP won 20 seats and the Congress came with 12 seats
 lekin donon ke vot hissedari main mahaj do fisadi kaa hi antar tha
 37 to BJP
 9 fisadi vot mili the or congress ko 35
 6 percent
 vindhyas pradesh kii 56 siton main se bhaajapa ko siten 36 siten or 39
 The Congress had managed to get 18 seats and 33 per cent of the votes while 1 per cent votes were received
 mahakaushal ilaake main kul 49 siten hai
 There was a big difference in vote share between the two parties
 vot share main yah antar kareeb das fisadi kaa tha
 Here BJP won 34 seats and Congress 14 seats
 uttari malwa main kul 63 or janajaatiy malwa ilaake main 28 siten hai
 51 respectively to BJP in both these areas
 8 or 45
 8 percent votes were received
 uttari malwa main bhaajapa ne dabadabaa kaayam karte hue 55 siten jeet lee thim or congress ko mahaj 7 siton par samet diya
 Congress also votes 37
 8 fisadi mili
 The BJP had won 20 seats in tribal Malwa and the Congress had won only 7 seats here
 lekin use vot kareeb 40 fisadi mili the
 But this time the challenge for Shivraj Singh Chauhan is more difficult because a large section of rural Madhya Pradesh is angry with him
 khaskar, jis seemaant bhoomihin kisaan or choti jot vaale kisaanon ne bhaajapa ko vot diya tha, vah usase bidke hue lag rahe hai
 In fact, the income of farmers of Madhya Pradesh has been decreasing for the last two years due to poor crops due to less rain and changing weather
 unki haalat 2013-14 se hi kharaab honi shuru hui he jab kheti kaa jidipi sikudakar 1
 14 per cent and it increased to 4 the following year
 6 fisadi to hua lekin phir 2015-16 main ghatakar 1
 Only 7 percent remained
 ab aankadon main ek jaadui oochaal dikhaa, jab 2016-17 ke aankadon ne is vruddhi ko 22 fisadi se adhik bataa diya
 The general reason behind this was that bumper yield skyrocketed the growth figure after poor production a year earlier
 lekin notebandi or phir jiesti ne upaj kii keemton ko dharashayi kar diya
 In such a situation, the farmers want the government to assure them a price of one and a half times their cost and all their debts are forgiven
 haalanki, shivaraj singh chouhan is gusse ko thaamne ke liye koshish kar rahe hai or unhone mukhyamantri bhavantar bhugtan yojana shuru kii he, jiske tahat badjaar main upaj bech paane main naakaam kisaanon ko sidhe sarkaar mulya degi
 Yet the farmers are dissatisfied and at such a time when there is not much time left for the election, the BJP will have to prepare its strategy with a different perspective
 aakhir congressmukt bharat kaa sapana dekhne vaali bhaajapa ke liye shivaraj samasyamukt madhya pradesh to bananaa hi chahenge

 Khurshid told reporters in Varanasi that Modi's campaign would have no impact on Rahul's constituency
 unhone kaha ki modi rahul gandhi ke liye koi chunauti nahin hai balki bijepi or modi ko lagata he ki rahul unke liye chunauti hai
 Asked about the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) candidate from Hamirpur, Kamal Kant Batra, who is the mother of martyr Vikram Batra in the Kargil war, Khurshid said, "I personally believe that if such a brave martyr The mother has asked the BJP to withdraw its candidate, so they must definitely withdraw their candidate against them

 modi ne ganga main dubkee nahin lagaai kyonki unhen ashanka thi ki maa ganga unhen unke un paapon ke liye maaf nahin karengi jo unhone gujarat main kiye hai

 vahi hua jo modi chaahate the
 Everywhere in the Congress office on Monday, there was a discussion of Chief Minister Narendra Modi of Gujarat
 modi yahi to chaahate the
 When Pune attacked Modi in Pune, the Congress went stung and responded to everything Modi said, but in all this, he forgot that this was the trap of Modi in which the Congress got stuck
 congress ne shanivaar ko food security bill par badi baithak kii thi or tay ye hua tha ki somvaar se congress ke tamaam pravaktaa deshbhar main isi kaa danka bajaaenge, lekin uski jagah narendra modi ne le lee
 While the regular Congress press conference is held at four o'clock, but nervous by 'namo'niya, the Congress started attacking Modi at 12 o'clock in the morning
 congress ke prachaar pramukh ajay maakan ye chupa bhi nahin paye ki modi kii har jagah tasviir se congress tilamila gayi he
 In the very first line of getting to know from the press, Ajay Maken said that the media showed a lot to Modi on Sunday, so he is replying
 maakan ne kaha, 'modi sahab ko lekar media over anthiustic he, isliye ham jawaab de rahe hai taaki hamaari baat bhi jaye
 'it is the Congress that decided that it will not give importance to Modi nor will Modi's words be answered from Delhi
 tay ye bhi hua tha ki modi kaa jawaab gujarat ke congressi netaa hi denge, lekin modi congress ko apni pich par khinchne main kaamyaab rahe
 The pitch is also from Gujarat
 congress ne apane hi manch se baar-baar modi or gujarat kaa naam liya or ladaai ko modi banaam congress or gujarat banaam desh kar diya
 Throughout the night, Congress leaders kept tearing their eyes and extracting figures to compare the country and Gujarat
 somvaar ko congress ke kul 21 netaaon ne modi par hamalaa kiya
 Modi alone and the entire Congress against him
 kai netaa to modi ko nakaarte rahe, lekin bole jarur
 Perhaps thinking that if he speaks on Modi, the number will be more than 21
 jaise digivajay singh ne kaha ham modi ko ahmiyat nahin dete, lekin modi ko saaf karnaa chaiye ki dharmanirpekshata kii unki paribhaasha kya he
 Information Broadcasting Minister Manish Tiwari said that Modi wants to divide politics into communal colors, so that there is polarization in the country
 congress ke varisht netaa, jinhone modi ko bhav nahin dene kii ranneeti banaai thi, kasmasaate najar aaye
 Many believed that Modi would be infamous, but he would be named
 congress ke netaa shaayad is baat par khush honge ki modi kaa jamkar jawaab diya gaya, lekin modi khush hai ki chunaav kaa agenda unka hi he yani ek taraf modi or duusari taraf congress

 But it is not that in the midst of this masculinity, i forget that moment how i met Valentino Rossi and how i was photographed with him
 kaise is intervyuu yaa media kii bhashaa main kahen to interaction ke bich jon abraham kinare se ho gaye the
 That was the occasion of an event at Yamaha, when Yamaha's Moto GP team rider, motorcycle racing's most sensational star Valentino Rossi and Yamaha's brand ambassador in India John Abraham met the press team together
 rosi usase pehle bhi pasand the or aaj bhi pasand hai
 Their success is monitored and there is also some disappointment with the failures
 ek resar, jisane moto jeepi yani motorcykilon kii racing kii duniya ke liye wo kiya, jo shaayad hamaare jenereshan main maaikel shoomakar ne formula van ke liye or sachin ne cricket ke liye kiya
 Rossi's impulsiveness in the race circuit is seen comfortably on youtube today
 aapmen se jo moto jeepi racing kii duniya se parichit hai, unhen pataa hi hoga ki rosi phir se yamaha kii team ke liye res karte hai, is bich main wo dukaati kii team se ho aae hai
 However, the stories around Rossi now have that flirtation, not sensation, as before
 haal main wo chaar saal baad pole posishan le paae
 And still remained second in the race and in the championship
 pehle number par he, wo shaks jisane motorcycle racing main wo kar dikhaaya he ki sab bhounchakke hai, record par record banaata aisa noujvaan jisase bhidane ke bare main filhal khud rosi bhi nahin soch saktaa he
 That is Mark Marquez
 ye spanish rider ek aisa ajooba he ki record kii kitaaben rang di gai hai, res ke jaankaar bhounchakke hai or rosi jaisaa resar ise apana bed lack kah rahaa he, jo use championships kii jeet se itani dur kiye hue he ki rosi bebas dur khadaa he
 Mark Marquez
 
 
 jab se maine ye naam suna, tab se unke naam ke saath logon ko yahi kehete suna he - akhir ye chiz kya he markez, jisane 2008 se hilaa ke rakhaa hua he motorcycle racing kii duniya ko
 Currently motogp is the World Champion for the second consecutive year
 jab aap khojane jaaen, to pataa chalegaa ki ye wo rider he, jisane sabase kam umr main jeetne ke saare record tod daale hai
 Created new records one by one
 1993 main paidaa markez ne pehali baar 125 sisi catagori main qadam rakhaa, jab unki umr pandrah saal se thodi hi upar thi
 And this exciting world has rocked ever since
 2012 main 125 sisi vaale catagori main world champion bane
 The Moto2 World Champion in 2012, now the motogp World Champion of 2013 and 2014
 motogypi main bhi sabase kam umr main jeet hasil karne vaala rider bane wo
 So all these records are enough to explain what their ability is
 kya inkaa tallent he or kya ye aane vaale vakt main kar sakate hai
 Marquez is currently a rider of the Honda Repsol racing team
 to ek vakt main apni tezi or drama kii vajah se jaise rosi nami the, vaise hi markez ke bare main bhi duniya baat kar rahi he, lekin inamen tezi zyaada he, drama kam he
 So, if any of you are interested in motorcycle racing, remember this name

 haalanki unhone ye bhi kaha ki wo apane nazariye par kaayam hai
 I'm informed that this pic below isnt from the Kisan Yatra but from 2013 Jat Mahapanchayat in Meerut
 My point stands however - that the man with a brick in the pic hasn't been demonized as a terrorist and likewise a Kashmiri kid with a stone in his hand shouldn't be either

 Prime Minister Modi performed special worship at the Sai temple here, during which Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis and Governor Vidyasagar Rao were also present
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne yahaan mandir kii visitor book main apane vichaar bhi likhe
 The Prime Minister released a silver coin in memory of Sai Baba on the occasion
 iske alaava unhone pradhanmantri awaas yojana ke kai labhaarthiyon ko ghar kii chaabi saunpi
 He talked to the beneficiaries
 is kaarykram ke baad pradhanmantri narendra modi ne yahaan ek raily ko sambodhit kiya
 PM started his speech in Marathi language
 pradhanmantri ne deshavaasiyon ko yahaan se vijayadashami kii badhai di, meri koshish rahati he ki har tyohaar deshavaasiyon ke saath manaauun
 PM said that by remembering Sai, he gets power to serve the people
 unhone kaha ki sai kaa mantra he'sabakaa maalik ek he',sai samaaj ke the or ye samaaj sai kaa tha
 It is a privilege to work for the poor sitting at the feet of Sai
 unhone kaha ki mujhe khushi he ki dashahara ke is paavan avasar par mujhe maharashtra ke dhai lakh bahanon-bhaaiyon ko apana ghar saunpane kaa avasar mila he, mere wo bhai bahan jinke liye apana ghar, hameshaa sapana hi rahaa he
 The goal of previous governments was to promote only one family, not give home
 pradhanmantri bole ki pichhali sarkaar ne apane aakhri chaar saal main sirf 25 lakh ghar banaae the, lekin hamaari sarkaar ne apane chaar saal ke kaarykaal main 1 karod 25 lakh ghar banaae hai
 If there had been a previous government, it would have taken 20 years to build so many houses
 unhone kaha ki 2022 tak sabhi ko ghar dene kaa lakshya puraa kar liya jayega, ham is kaary ke aadhe safar tak pahunch chuke hai
 a permanent house makes life easy & provides enthusiasm to fight against poverty
 Keeping this in mind, the govt has set the goal of providing a permanent house to every family by 2022

 maharashtra, haryana or jharkhand main aane vaale kuch maheenon main honge chunaavnarendra modi sarkaar ke is kadam par rajyon ne aapatti darj karai haiek sitambar se nayaa motor whical act lagu hone ke baad deshbhar main tabadatod chaalaan kaate ja rahe hai
 In one case, the fine reached Rs one lakh 41 thousand
 lekin is kadam se un rajyon main dar paidaa ho gaya he, jinamein aagaamee maheenon main chunaav hone vaale hai
 Maharashtra, Haryana and Jharkhand are the only states where the voices have been raised against the Motor Vehicle Act
 in rajyon kii sarkaron kaa kahana he ki jurmaane kii raashi bahut zyada he or ise kam kiya janaa chahie
 State governments fear that the central government's improving traffic system may not take a heavy toll on their government
 lihaaja maharashtra kii devendra fadanvis sarkaar ne to sidhe taur par jurmaane kii raashi ko kam karne ke liye kendriya parivahan mantri nitin gadakari ko khat likh diya he
 At the same time, the Jharkhand government has indicated to amend the new Motor Vehicle Act
 parivahan mantri seepi singh kaa maananaa he ki jurmaana bahut zyada he
 He assured the people to wait only two days as PM Narendra Modi would be here and a special session would be called a day later
 unhone kaha ki registration, polution or anya niyam todane par jurmaana raashi kii samiksha kii jaaegi
 When the Transport Minister was asked that elections are going to be held in the state, can the new Motor Vehicle Act create trouble for the Raghubar Das government? In response, he said that we are concerned for the interests of the people
 jald hi jurmaana raashi main narmi kii jaaegi
 Amid the election call, the Maharashtra government has also raised the demand to reduce the fine amount
 rajya ke parivahan mantri divakar ravate ne khat main baari jurmaana raashi par phir se vichaar karne ko kaha he
 He appealed to the central government to reduce the fine
 sarkaar kaa kahana he ki jurmaana janata kii jad se baahar he
 People cannot pay this much penalty
 haalanki haryana ke mukhyamantri manohar laal khatter ne bhi is maamle main naram rukh dikhaaya he
 He said that people will be made aware of the new traffic rules for 45 days
 haalanki jab unase poocha gaya ki anya pradeshon kii tarah nae motor whical act ke praavdhaanon ko naram kiya jayega
 On this, he said that 70-80 percent people are not going to accept without an invoice
 ve lagaataar niyamon kaa ulanghan kar rahe hai
 But Khattar would not like to take the risk of offending people in an election year
 rajyon ke rukh se yah to saaf he ki chunavi saal main janata par baari jurmaane kaa boj vah katai ladanaa nahin chahenge kyonki naaraaz janata sarkaron ke liye hi rajyon main satta kaa darwaja band bhi kar sakati he

 Shivraj Singh Chauhan, the head of Madhya Pradesh government, showed the level of sentiment of his ministers in Pachmarhi's workshop
 lekin kis mantri kii bhaavana kisi he, sarkaar use saarvajanik karne se parhez kar rahi he
 Chief Minister Chauhan organized a workshop for ministers in Pachmarhi on 1-2 February 2009
 iskaa uddeshyah mantriyon ko sushasan, paardarshita, javabdehi, netritv kshamta kaa paath padhaanaa or unki bhaavnaatmak budghi kaa str jaananaa
 To assess this, Indira Parikh, former faculty member of IIM Ahmedabad and Prof
 of Delhi University
 girishwar mishra ko bulaayaa gaya tha
 Test was done, the result also came but this result did not reach the public
 ab to sarkaar aise kisi test se bhi inkaar kar rahi he
 Bhopal-based RTI activist Ajay Dubey on February 4, 2009, spent on the Pachmarhi workshop under RTI and e of the cabinet including CM kyuu
 Tests (emotional quotient or emotional intelligence) were sought
 yah apil sushasan evam niti vishleshan skool ko bheji gai
 But the appellate authority, Akhilesh Argal, gave only information related to the expenditure, including Rs 8 lakh on the workshop
 kharch kii jaankaree di gai
 But IQ refused to give a copy of the test report as private information or to inspect the original report

 In its decision on 9 March 2012, the Commission directed that the information sought within 15 days should be made available free of charge, after which on 16 March 2012, the information officer sent Dubey a courier
 kyuu
 Send test documents

 Why
 test kii teble shit thi lekin koun si shit kis mantri kii he, yah nahin bataaya gaya
 Anonymous sheets are given a minimum of two points and a maximum of 15 points on 11 dimensions, such as emotional expression, other person's emotional consciousness, desire, relationship with others, constructive dissatisfaction, compassion, attitude, perception, trust, control and honesty
 lekin ank kitne main se die gaye hai, yah nahin bataaya gaya he
 Leader of the Opposition Ajay Singh says, "E of Ministers"
 kyuu
 Will be less, that's why the government is hiding
 '' jabaki swasthya mantri narottam mishra aise kisi test se hi inkaar karte hue kehete hai, ''na test hua, na number die gaye
 If something like this had happened, the government would have told
 '' haalanki sarkaar kii tab fajihat ho gai jab uske apane hi mantri babulal gaur or karan singh verma ne test kii baat sweekaar kii
 Gaur said, "I am a personal witness
 prashn saarvajanik rup se puche gaye the
 '' The question arises that if the test was not done, where did the sheet that Dubey came from? Another document from RTI shows that the ministers had also evaluated the workshop and the speakers, in which a minister has given a very interesting response, "honesty, honesty, gentleness, trust, etc
 have not given importance to qualities
" '' is moolyankan patr main kaaryshaala main bhaag lene vaale mantriyon se yah bhi poocha gaya, kya aisi or bhi kaaryshaalaayein honi chahie? kaaryshaala kii vishay vastu / charchaa aapke liye upyogi he? in sabhi prashnon ke jawaab in mantri ji ne ''nahin'' main die hai
 Says Dubey, "then the Chief Minister announced to do the workshop every year

 In contrast, in the Super Series premiere, the biggest tournament of the game, the total prize money is only $ 250,000 and the winner gets only 8% of this amount

 Nonetheless, IBL has made badminton a professional sport, with both money and fame
 yahaan tak ki nae or abhi khaas pahchaan na rakhane vaale khiladinnon ko bhi acchhee-khaasi rakam milane lagi he
 In terms of money, badminton has become the number two sport in India after cricket
 isane rashtriya khel hockey ko bhi peeche chhod diya he
 Ashish Chadha, CEO of Sports Solutions, organizer of IBL, told India Today, "badminton is a sport where Indian players are consistently doing well
 sina ke alaava hamaare paas 7 aise khilaadi hai, jo chotii ke 30 khiladinnon main aate hai
 Thus, it has become the second number game in the country
 ”duniya main tisare number kii khilaadi sina kaa maananaa he ki is lig se cricket ke diwane desh main badminton ko badhaava milegaa

 Saina and Sindhu have not played against each other in any competition so far
 lekin ummid he ki ibl main unhen kam-se-kam do baar aisa mauka jarur milegaa
 This will also remove the fear of new players from playing against big players because they will be able to get closer to each other in the tournament

 This will obviously give players the status of a well-known figure

 Critics are a little skeptical, but the IBL has the necessary spice to succeed — money, glamorous bosses, vigorous publicity, and a genuine effort to raise the standard and popularity of the sport of badminton
