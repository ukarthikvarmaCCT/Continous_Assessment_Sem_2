 Accordingly, asset management companies are now merging their plans, naming them or changing their basic form
 sawaal uthta he ki isse niveshak par kya asar hoga?badlaav par gaur karensbase pehle aapako yah dekhnaa chahie ki aapke portpholio main jo skim hai unamem kya badlaav aayaa he
 In many cases you will see that the scheme has just changed its name, there is no change at the level of the portfolio or the way of investment
 misaal ke taur par, aditya birla sanlife top 100 fund ko ab aditya birla sanlife focusd equity fund ke naam se janaa jayega
 Only the name of this fund has changed
 fund ke lakshya main badlavniveshak ko yadi lagata he ki skim ke buniyadi swaroop main hi badlaav aa gaya he to use kisi export se salaah leni chahie-daalamia adwijuri services ke diarector brijesh daalamia kehete hai, "yadi kisi niveshak ko lagata he ki uske apane vittiya lakshya se fund ke lakshya kaa talmail kathin he, to use apane vittiya salaahkaar se madad lekar koi kadam uthaanaa chahie
 "schemes merged" Many mutual fund houses have merged all their schemes
 udhaaharan ke liye, ab echdiefasi premier multicap fund kaa vilay echdiefasi hybrid equity fund ke saath kar diya gaya he
 The HDFC Premier Multicap Fund was a pure equity fund, but has now been merged with a hybrid class fund, which invests in both equity and debt
 yadi kisi kaa nivesh long turm ke vittiya lakshya ke saath tha or vah ooncha jokhim lene main sakasham he, to vilay vaali yojana uske liye upyukt nahin he, isliye baahar nikalakar kisi or fund main nivesh par sochna chahie
 Don't be alarmed by the low returns that many schemes in your portfolio have underperformed
 lekin aapako jaldbaaji main koi kadam nahin uthaanaa chahie, kyonki visheshgyon kaa maananaa he ki in yojanaon main long turm main acha ritern mil saktaa he
 Tarun Birani, founder of TBNG Capital Advisors, says, "after new changes, benchmarking can be done more effectively
 '' unke shabdon main, "pehle, large-cap fund apane portpholio main mid cap share rakhte the, isi prakaar balanced fund apane portpholio main karj yaa equity kaa ucch anupaat rakhte the
 Now everyone has to perform on the basis of merit, not on the basis of maneuver
 ''tex kii jaankaree karensamay se pehle fund se baahar nikalnaa mahangaa pad saktaa he
 In case of equity or equity oriented funds, any investment of less than one year attracts a short term capital gains tax of 15%
 ek saal se zyada ke nivesh ke maamle main yadi salanaa phayda ek lakh rupee se zyada ho jaataa he to us par 10 fisadi kaa long turm capital gen tex lagata he
 What do you have to do? You have to find out whether the changes are just showy, like a change in name or indeed there is a change in the investment target
 If there is a big change then try to know that the investment is suitable for your needs
 or not
 yadi nahin he to vikalp dekhen
 Know how to get out of the fund and how much is the exit load, keep in mind that tax does not hurt maharashtra ke saarvajanik udhyam mantri or rashtravaadi congress party (rakanpa) ke netaa jaidatt kshirsagar ko nishaanaa banaate hue bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) ne unke khilaaf adaalat kii kathor tippanee ke baad mantrimandal se unke istife kii maang kii
 State BJP General Secretary and MLA Devendra Fadnavis told reporters that the minister's act in awarding fee payment contracts for the Solapur City Integrated Road Development Scheme caused a huge loss to the government exchequer and was not done with good sentiment, in the light of such remarks In this, Kshirsagar has no moral right to continue in his post

 In front of the Parliamentary Committee headed by former Union Minister Veerappa Moily, the Ministry of Agriculture has admitted that demonetisation has caused considerable loss to farmers
 jis par raajnneeti tej ho rahi he
 Member of the same committee and Bharatiya Janata Party MP Nishikant Dubey has filed a complaint against Moily for breach of privilege
 nishikant dube ne loksabhaa spikar sumitra mahajan se virappa moili kii shikaayat kii he
 He alleges that Moily placed matters related to the Parliamentary Committee in the public domain through Kotwiter, which is against the rules
 isliye unpar karrwai honi chahie
 Let us tell you that Veerappa Moily is the chairman of the Parliamentary Committee attached to the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Agriculture had submitted before the Committee a report related to demonetisation, in which it was said to have a bad effect on the farmers
 aisa kaaphi kam hi hota he jab kisi sansadeey samiti kaa sadsy samiti ke adhyaksh ke khilaaf hi is prakaar kaa notice laata he
 Nishikant Dubey wrote in his complaint that Moily shared it on Twitter to politicize the work of the committee, which is against the rules
 unhone apil kii he ki moili ke khilaaf sheetakaaleen satr main visheshadhikaar hanan kaa notice laane kii ijaajat di jaae
 Significantly, since this report, the opposition has been targeting the Modi government
 aapako bataa den ki sansadeey samiti ke saamne krishi mantralay ne kabuula tha kinotbandike kaaran kisaanon par kaaphi bura asar padaa tha
 Due to this many farmers were not able to buy seeds and fertilizers, even the farmers being sold by the government could not buy any seeds

 upi chunaav ke pehle charan kii voting ke liye adhisuchana jari hone main ab mahaj 8 din baaki hai
 Bahujan Samaj Party has declared its candidates in almost all the seats, leaving behind other parties
 basapa supremeo mayawati jab 2007 ke chunaavon main aitihaasik janadesh lekar ai thim to uske peeche unki soshal ejineering ko bada kaaran mana gaya tha
 The special thing is that Mayawati has also completely focused on her 'engineering' this time
 yahi vajah he ki daliton ko centre main rakhkar raajnneeti karne vaali is party ne sabase zyada tikat savarna ummidavaaron kii die hai
 Dalits constitute 21–22 per cent of the population in Dalit UP
 inamen jatav sarvaadhik 14% hai
 Mayawati is considered to have a good hold over her votes
 baaki 12 se 14 fisadi dalit jatiyon main khatic, paswan, kori, khairavaar, dhobi, valmiki aadi shaamil hai
 Mayawati has given 87 tickets out of her total 403 to Dalit candidates
 yani mayawati ne bhi 21 fisadi se zyada apane tikat us samudaay ko die hai jisaki upi kii aabaadi main takreeban itnaa hi hissaa he
 According to the Muslim 2011 census, Hindus have a population of 79 in UP
 73 fisadi (kareeb 16 karod) he jabaki muslim yahaan 19
 26 percent (3
 84 karod) hai
 Mayawati has fielded more than 97 Muslim candidates this time, which constitutes about 25 per cent of her total candidates
 savarnayupi main agadi jatiyon kii aabaadi 18-20 fisadi he
 Of this, 8-9 percent are Brahmins, 4-9 percent Rajputs, 3-4 percent Vaishyas and the rest are Tyagi, Bhumihars and others
 mayawati ne 113 tikat savarnon ko die hai jo ki unke kul ummidavaaron kaa 28 fisadi he
 It is clear that Mayawati is ready to make a dent in the vote bank of others by assuring her core voters in these elections
 obisiupi main pichhadi jatiyon kii aabaadi 42-45% he
 Among them, Yadav is the highest at 10%, Lodhi 3-4%, Kurmi 4-5%, Maurya 4-5% and other 21%
 mayawati ne is baar 106 ummidavaar isi shrenee se utaare hai
 That is, about 26 percent of their candidates are from the Other Backward Classes
 agar aabaadi se pariprekshya main dekha jaae to mayawati yahaan thodaa pichhadati najar aa rahi hai
 One reason for this may be that the ruling Samajwadi Party of the state has been collecting the largest share of the voters of this class and Maya has not played her stake here for fear of failure

 'PM Dawaari: Pointing suspense at Nitish to' NO 'modi, a party leader had said in Saturday's JDU executive meeting that "being popular is different and becoming Prime Minister is different
 ’ singh ne kaha ki vah is baat ko lekar aashwast hai ki bijepi kaa sansadeey board jo bhi faisla karegaa usase koi sankat paidaa nahin hoga
 i can say this with confidence
 ’baharhaal, bijepi pramukh is sawaal kaa jawaab taal gayi ki kya vah yah suzav de rahe hai ki modi kaa naam pradhanmantri ummidavaar ke rup main pesh nahin kiya jaye

 Discussion with the new ministers is also about the ministers who are to be discharged from the cabinet

 Just before the Lok Sabha elections 2019, the Congress government has been formed in three states
 in chunaavon main congress kii jeet kaa bada kaaran kisaanon se karj maafee kaa vaada mana ja rahaa he
 After this victory, once again many states are announcing the loan waiver of the farmers so that the resentment of the farmer in the general elections does not cut the votes
 karjamaafee ke elaan se vot bachenge yaa nahin, ye to aam chunaav ke nattejey hi bataaenge lekin itnaa tay he ki karj maafee kii hode aam kar daataaon kii jeb jarur kaat legi
 Since 2017, the GDP is declining due to debt waiver, since 2017, the treasury of most states is facing pressure due to the political stakes of farmer loan waiver released in the country
 kisaan karj ko maaf karne kii shuruyaat karte hue maharashtra sarkaar ne 34,000 karod rupee kaa nuksaan pahunchaaya or rajya kii jidipi 1
 Reduced by 3%
 iske baad uttar pradesh main bani yogi sarkaar ne 36,000 karod rupee kii karj maafee kii or rajya kii jidipi ko 2
 7 percent were hurt

 1 percent and 0
 9 fisadi kaa nuksaan hua
 According to India Today editor Anshuman Tiwari, a total loan waiver of Rs 1 lakh 72 thousand 146 crore has been announced during this period
 maafee se marz na ban jaae kisaanon kaa karj, bevajaah chintit nahin hai bankkiskaa karj hua maaf kiskaa rahaa baaki?india today ke neshnal afares editor rahul shrivastav kaa kahana he ki karj maafee ko raajnneetik hathiyaar 2008 main manmohan singh kii upie sarkaar ne banaaya or 70,000 karod rupee kii deshvyapee karj maafee kaa elaan kiya
 But after this announcement, during the next four years, the central government was able to forgive the debt of Rs 52,000 crore and the loan of Rs 18,000 crore remained outstanding as promised
 thik isi tarah karnataka main bani nai kumaraswami sarkaar ne 8,000 karod rupee ke karjamaafee kaa elaan kiya lekin abhi tak mahaj 400 karod rupee kaa karj maaf ho sakaa he
 Therefore, the question arises that when the central or state governments declare to waive the farmer loans, why the entire loan is not repaid
 aakhir kin kisaanon kaa karj baaki rah jaataa he jiskaa paisa sarkari khajaane se nahin miltaa? rahul shrivastav kaa kahana he ki isse yah bhi saaf he ki aise chunavi vaadon kaa phayda kisaanon tak nahin pahunchataa
 Not necessarily electoral benefit from debt waiver, Anshuman Tiwari says that there is no guarantee that victory can be decided by announcing farmer loan waiver before the elections
 karnataka main congress sarkaar ne karjamaafee kaa elaan kiya lekin iskaa koi sidhaa asar chunaav nateezon par nahin dikhaa
 At the same time, Vasundhara Raje's government in Rajasthan announced a debt waiver of 8,000 crores before the elections and she is sitting out of power
 laut rahi he mahangaai, aarthik morche par chunautiyaan lekar aa rahaa he saal 2019anshuman tiwari ne bataaya ki desh main 2017 se lekar abhi tak saat rajyon main karj maafee kaa raajnneetik daanv chalaa gaya he
 This happened in June 2017 in Punjab and Maharashtra, April 2017 in Uttar Pradesh, February 2018 in Rajasthan, July 2018 in Karnataka, Chhattisgarh and December 2018 in Madhya Pradesh
 kisaan karj maafee kaa aankadarijrv bank ke aankade dikhaate hai ki desh main kisaan karj maafee kii kitni jarurat he
 According to statistics, where 29 percent of the total debt is in Madhya Pradesh and 35 percent in Rajasthan, there is debt in the agricultural sector
 vahiin madhya pradesh main krishi kshetra main fansaa hua karj 11 fisadi he
 The state government is announcing this loan to be forgiven, but the central government and how much state government will give this loan, it is not decided yet
 anshuman tiwari ne kaha ki iske chalate uttar pradesh or maharashtra kii sarkaar ko karj maafee kii puri rakam apane bajet se nikaalani padi
 For this amount, Uttar Pradesh had to reduce the development work by one-third while the Maharashtra government had to take a loan from Shirdi temple at a lower rate to meet its expenditure
 jaahir he ki karj maafee kaa yah daanv raajnneetik dalon ko vot dilaae na dilaae iskaa khamiyaja ek aam tex peyar ko bharna padegaa kyonki sarkaron ko apana kharch nikaalane kii praathamikta ke baad vot batorna hi praathamikta he or is bich vikaas kii raftaar par lagaam lagi rahegi

 The recent developments in Neemuch in Madhya Pradesh are nothing short of Bollywood's sensational film story
 isamen suspence he, drama he, aparaadh he, bhrasht pulicekarmi hai to eemaandaar adhikari bhi hai
 The story begins with a person killed in a road accident a year and a half ago, based on the identity card from which he is identified as 36-year-old Ghanshyam Dhakkar, a notorious drug trafficker
 baad main police ko pataa chalata he ki dhakad jinda he or taskari kar rahaa he
 a bigger disclosure comes when he is caught by the police
 pataa chalata he ki yah to mahaj trailor he, puri film to abhi baaki he
 Arrested detainee reveals that being proven dead in the police records is the safest method of smuggling and this tactic was revealed to him by another smuggler Bansi Gurjar, who was allegedly killed in an encounter in police documents
 deshbhar main opium kii kheti ke liye pahachaanaa jane vaala mandsaur-neemuch kshetra isaki taskari ke liye bhi kukhyat he
 Smuggling was also the reason for this incident
 taskari kaa dhandha aaraam se chalata rahe isliye ghanashyam ne ek vyakti kii hatya kar apana parichay-patr or mobile uski jeb main rakh diya or shav kaa cheharaa buree tarah se bigaad diya taaki use pahachaanaa na ja sake
 The family members of Ghanshyam also identified the corpse as Ghanshyam
 is tarah vah police filon main mrit ghoshit ho gaya or uske khilaaf chal rahe sabhi maamle band kar die gaye
 Ujjain range IG Upendra Jain says, "dhakad was arrested in 2008 for smuggling 50 kg of opium, two years later in 2010 he was released on bail and escaped
 march 2011 main usne khud ko mara hua sabit karne kii yojana banaai
 This included his family members
 ’’is maamle main pulicekarmiyon kii bhoomika bhi sandigdh he
 Cases were already registered on Dhakad i
e
 police records should have his photo, other identification marks
 aise main police ne ghanashyam ke parijanon kii baat par kaise vishwaas kar liya?iji jain kehete hai, ‘‘tatkaaleen thana prabharee rabindra boit, jaanch adhikari sahaayak up nireekshak em
 R
 garg or hawaldaar umesh chouhan ko nilambit kar diya gaya he
 In this case they are either complicit or negligent
 ’’ sutara bataate hai ki ghanashyam ke mobile kol detel se ve pulicekarmi beparda ho sakate hai jinhone is shadyantr main bhagidaari kii
 Now the police is trying to find out whose body the Ghanshyam was supposed to be
 ghanashyam ne poochtacha main jo khulaase kiye usase police bhi hairaan rah gai
 Rather once again the functioning of the police came into the dock
 ghanashyam ne bataaya ki yah sajeesh kukhyat taskar bansi gurjar or uske saathi pappu gurjar ke dimag kii upaj he
 An even bigger revelation was that Bansi Gurjar, who was allegedly killed in an encounter in February 2009, is also alive
 ab nayaa sawaal yah tha ki gurjar jinda he to muthbhed main maaraa gaya vyakti koun tha or police ne uski shinaakht bansi gurjar ke rup main kaise kii? ratlam range ke diiji satish saxena kehete hai, ‘‘muthbhed vaale din police ko mubir se soochna mili thi ki bansi vahaan se guzarane vaala he
 a person came there and was killed in the encounter
 iske baad bansi ke parijanon ne aakar uski shinaakht bansi ke rup main kii
 "neemuch Superintendent of Police Ramashray Choubey says," If the family had recognized him, there was no question of doubt
 ’’ police ko ghanashyam ke alaava or bhi kai logon se bansi ke jivit hone kii baat pataa chali he
 Bansi is seen with colleagues in a video clip attached to the police
 saxena kehete hai ‘‘ab tak mili sabooton se saaf he ki bansi gurjar jinda he
 "now the then police officers are shying away from this fake encounter
 neemuch ke tatkaaleen police adheekshak or vartmaan main shadol range ke iji veda prakaash sharma kehete hai, ‘‘mere kaarykaal main police muthbhed main maare gaye vyakti kii shinaakht bansi gurjar ke rup main hui thi
 His family had identified him
 sambandhit thana prabharee ne bhi police record main maujuud gurjar se sambandhit tathyon ke aadhaar par use bansi gurjar hi bataaya tha
 On the question of deciding the responsibility of police officers, DIG Saxena says, "until Bansi Gurjar is found, his DNA is not tested, nothing can be said
" ’’ ab bansi ko dhundh nikaalnaa police ke liye badi chunauti he
 Chaubey says, "according to information from sources, Bansi is taking advantage of the ruggedness
 ’’ opium taskari ke alaava bansi ke khilaaf lut-dakaiti or jabaran vasuuli jaise sangeen maamle bhi darj the or bataaya jaataa he ki neemuch jile ke rampura or manasa kshetra main uskaa acha-khaasaa khauf tha
 The real villain of this story is opium and its smuggling
 narkotics control beuro ne rajasthan, madhya pradesh or uttar pradesh main opium kii kheti ke kareeb 61,000 license de rakhe hai, jinamein se 27,000 se zyada madhya pradesh ke hai jahaan 13,000 hectare se zyada jameen par opium ugaai jaati he
 99 percent opium producing area of the state is in mandsaur-neemuch, so there are more cases of smuggling in this area
 is saal 29 june ko narkotics control beuro ne neemuch kii ratangarh tehsil ke ek gaanv se 7 logon ko hiraasat main lekar 65 kilogram opium jabt kii thi
 Earlier on February 26, 14 kg 500 grams of opium was recovered from Neemuch district
 4 march ko neemuch se 9 kilo 50 gram opium jabaki 9 march ko mandsaur ke najadik kareeb 1 kilo 800 gram heroin banane kaa rasayan jabt kiya gaya tha
 The country produces an average of 700 tonnes of opium annually, about 400 tonnes of which comes from this region
 isiilie desh ke vaid opium utpaadak kshetron main madhya pradesh ke mandsaur-neemuch kaa mahatvapurn sthaan he
 One farmer here says, "smuggled opium meets farmers who produce after taking a license but either do not show it or show very little
" ’’baharhaal police ne sajeeshkartaaon kii dharpakad shuru kar di he
 Based on Ghanshyam's statement and presence in the video clip, liquor baron Pappu Gurjar has been arrested and other family members including his father, who identified the body as Ghanshyam, have also been arrested
 desh kii rajdhani ek baar phir sharmasaar ho gai he

 jyotish kii sateek vyakhya or fal ke liye hameshaa nakshatron par vichaar kiya jaataa he
 Nakshatras have different nature and also have different fruits
 kuch nakshatra komal hote hai kuch kathor or kuch ugr hote hai 
 Only the constellations of fiery and incisive nature are called the original constellation, Satasa or Gandat
 jab balak in nakshatron main janm letaa he to vishesh tarah ke prabhaav dekhne main aate hai
 Being born in these nakshatras directly affects the nature and health of the child
 koun-koun se hote hai mul nakshatra or or unka prabhaav kya he ?- mul ,jyeshtha or ashlesha nakshatra mukhya mul nakshatra hai or ashvini,revati or magha sahaayak mul nakshatra hai
 Thus, in total there are 6 basic constellations - Ashwini, Aashlesha, Magha, Jyestha, Magha and Revathi
 - jab balak kaa janm iname hota he to balak ke swasthya kii sthiti samvedansheel ho jaati he,- mana jaataa he ki pita ko navjaat kaa mukh nahin dekhnaa chahie jab tak isaki shanti na kara lee jaae
 In reality, the whole decision should not be taken only on the basis of constellations - decide it only after looking at the horoscope

 Giving the example of Rwanda of Africa, the Prime Minister said that he had gone there and cow is offered to people in villages there
 gaanv main gaay, pashupaalan or dugdh utpaadan arthvyavastha kaa aadhaar bane hai
 The government takes the first heifer of the offered cow and hands it over to those who do not have the cow
 is tarah puri shrinkhalaa chalati rahati he or gaay logon kii aay kaa ek hissaa banati he
 Reacting to Modi's remarks, CPI general secretary D

 Regarding the Prime Minister's comment, All India majlis-e-ittehad-ul-muslimeen (AIMIM) chief Asaduddin Owaisi told TV channels that people in India not only listen to 'om' and 'cow', but the mosques' ajans, in gurdwaras One also hears recitations and bells of churches
 unhone kaha, ‘‘log jab gaay ke naam par maare ja rahe hai to aapako chintit hona chahie
 The Prime Minister should be worried that the Constitution is being violated
 ham apane pradhanmantri se ummid karte hai ki jab tabrej, pahalu khan yaa akhlaaq maare ja rahe hai to unhen yah sochakar chintit hona chahie ki ‘mere desh main kya chal rahaa he
 "nationalist Congress Party MP Majid Memon said that Modi is the Prime Minister of a secular country and he should not mention religious matters very often
 unhone kaha, ‘‘vah dharmaguru nahin hai
 
 
 The Prime Minister should make it clear that 'I as the head of the government will not tolerate anyone in the name of religion, in the name of' Om 'or' Cow ', will not let them take the law into their own hands

 jab ground kii safai ke liye har taraf se niraashaa mili to ramlila ke aayojakon or kalakaaron ne khud hi morcha sambhaal kar maidan ko saaf karnaa shuru kiya
 The actors playing the role of Ram saw themselves sweeping with a broom in their hands
 vahiin hanuman or lakshmana ke paatr nibhaane vaale kalakaar fawde tasale se keechad uthaa kar maidan ko saaf karte dikhe
 On this occasion, all the actors appeared in the traditional costumes of Ramlila
 beete din main aayojakon ko ramlila kaa sthaan bhi majabuuran gymkhana ground se hataakar paas kii dharmashala main karnaa padaa
 But due to very little space there, very few people are able to come to see Ramlila
 ramlila cameti ke kalakaaron or aayojakon kaa kahana he ki gymkhana jaisaa ground darshakon se bharaa hone par ramlila ke liye alag hi utsaah or shraddha kaa anubhav hota he
 Leaders and officials keep coming to the dock of allegations for not paying attention to people's problems
 lekin gymkhana ground ko kai baar kii guhaar ke baad bhi saaf nahin karaane ko aayojak logon kii aasthaa se judaa vishay bataa rahe hai
 Their question is whether after the passing of Dussehra, the officials and leaders will be able to get the ground cleaned

 ' On the other hand, the government has failed to challenge Lakhvi's bail
 sarkaar kaa kahana he ki nyaayadhish ne aadesh kii prati jari nahin kii he

 China, which aspires to rule the world, itself remains its biggest enemy
 lihaaja uskaa bhi vahi haal hoga, jo soviet sangh kaa hua tha yani soviet sangh kii tarah china bhi dhah jayega
 a senior official associated with the campaign against corruption in China has claimed this
 china kii sattarudh communist party ke paulitabeuro ke sadsy yang shiaodu ne kaha ki agar bhrashtachar ke khilaaf abhiyaan main vifaltaa milti he, to yah desh ke liye behad ghaatak sabit hoga
 Shiaodu has been promoted to deputy commissioner of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and made a member of Politburo, considered to be the country's second-highest official in the campaign against corruption
 maaloom ho ki paulitabeuro ke sadasyon kaa desh kii satta main puraa niyantran hota he
 During this time, Shiaodu also strongly criticized the previous government
 unhone kaha ki pichley shasankaal main bhrashtachar is had tak bad gaya tha ki sattarudh party netritv kamjor pad gaya
 During this period the inspection was very weak and the ideology remained inattentive
 unhone kaha ki purvavarti sarkaar ne bhrashtachar ko phoolne-phalne diya
 Softness was taken against corruption and apathy was shown in taking action
 bhrashtachar badal degaa china kaa swarupachinake sarkari akhbaar pipuls daily ke sampadakeey lekh main shiaodu ne kaha ki agar china main bhrashtachar ko khatm nahin kiya gaya, to desh kaa swaroop hi badal jayega or yah barbaad ho jayega
 He said that if corruption is not curbed in time, then the ruling party and the people of the country will see devastation like the Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc
 bhrashtachar ke chalate desh soviet sangh or eastern block kii tarah dhah jayega
 The Soviet Union disintegrated in the early 1990s
 satta main pakad dhili hui, to china bhi bikhar saktaa haishiaodu ne kaha ki chini raashtrapati shi jinping bhi apane purvavartiyon kii tarah yah maanate hai ki agar satta par pakad dhili hui, to desh main uthal-puthal much sakati he or desh bikhar saktaa he
 This is why the ruling Communist Party of China always asks its cadre to study the disintegration of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s
 china main jari rahegi bhrashtachar ke khilaaf ladaishiaodu ne apane sampadakeey main sanket diya ki chini raashtrapati shi jinping ke daahine haath maane jane vaale wang quishaan kii vidaai ke baad bhi bhrashtachar ke khilaaf ladaai kamjor nahin hogi
 Wang Quishan was considered China's second most powerful leader before a change in ruling Communist Party leadership last month
 is badlaav ke baad unako pichley maheene hi anti-karpshan ke pramukh ke pad se hataaya gaya tha
 On Saturday, the new chief of anti-corruption Zhao Lezi wrote a similar article about corruption in an editorial of the Chinese newspaper People's Daily on Saturday, before the rest of the Chinese ruling party, still cleaning up within China's ruling party
 leji ko wang quishaan kii jagah anti-karpshan kaa nayaa pramukh banaaya gaya he
 Xiaodu also said in his article that Xi Jinping has achieved a lot in the fight against corruption, but the cleanliness of the corruption within the party is still to be done
 unhone kaha ki bhrashtachar ke khilaaf yah ladaai kaaphi gambhir or jatil he
 It can be eliminated only through continuous aggressive action

 The reason is that the Left has finally found a leader who is ready to counter the TMC and its supremo Mamata Banerjee's "inch by inch" revenge
 “main unhen (mamata ko) kahata hum ki tum jab tak inch dar inch napogi, tab tak yah jot (jan gathbandhan) bahut dur nikal chukaa hoga
 "suryakant Mishra says this with great confidence and there is an uproar of happiness in the crowd of 10,000

 The reason for this is undoubtedly Dr

 He lends a new life to the CPM, which was almost in a coma since the 2011 election defeat

 He was never known to speak aloud in his 39-year-long political career, even when his flamboyant and popular leaders set the stage ablaze

 "mishra came into politics in the late 1970s

 a CPM leader says, "bimanada was so impressed that he wanted Surya to come completely into politics
 1980 ke dashak main ve midanapur kii jila parishad ke sabhadhipati bane or is pad par 12 saal rahe
 After that he moved to Kolkata

 ”mishra kattarpanthi maane jate hai
 Initially, he was not recognized as a mass leader in the party

 Then, like Karat and other hardliners, Surya Babu was among those who thought it was right to withdraw support from the UPA-1 on the nuclear deal issue with the US in 2008
 haalanki baad main yah faisla bengal main party kii siyaasi bhul sabit hua, jab isaki vajah se tiemasi ko pair jamaane kaa mauka mil gaya
 "it was only natural then that when former CPM Chief Minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharya promoted Surya, he not only made a cabinet minister in his cabinet and entrusted him with the responsibility of niche areas like panchayat, rural development and health, but also gave him" party capital While reading their verses while stating that, some comrades were sobbing with compressed words

 If he became the Leader of the Opposition due to the absence of other big leaders, then only the people of his party had doubt whether Surya, the mild and low-speaking, would be able to counter the inflammatory politics of the ruling party
 magar mishra ne is bhoomika ke hisaab se apane ko dhaala, khaas muddon par sarkaar ko gheraa or jaraa-si bhi bhulchook par mamata ko aade haathon liya

 As party secretary, he took to the streets, met people and stood with the cadre
 us kader ke saath jo sattarudh party kii jyadatiyon kaa shikaar ho rahaa tha
 Says a member of the party's Central Committee, "despite being a communist theorist, he felt that there was no harm in taking a flexible approach to the broad interest of the public and accepting the demands of practical life
" ”sanyog se 2016 main jab sipiem main kattarpathiyon or dakshin bhartiya lobby ne “arajak tiemasi” kaa muqabla karne ke liye sambhavit vam-congress gathbandhan par vichaar karne se manaa kar diya, tab surya hi the jinhone donon partiyon ke saath aane kii paraakaari kii-sirf isliye nahin ki yah siyaasi majaburi thi yaa bengal main vajood ko bachaane kii ladaai thi, balki un hajaaron kaadaron kii khatir jinhen lagaataar khadeda ja rahaa tha, jhuthe mukademe laade or jurmaane thoke ja rahe the
 He argued in the Central Committee and Politburo that not standing with the people at this time and not respecting their demand for an alliance would be like committing suicide
 bataate hai, baithkon main surya ne kaha, “hamane 175 commeredon ko kho diya he
 More than 2,000 have been permanently bedridden and thousands are facing false political charges
 bas ab bahut ho chukaa
 Now the time has come to directly confront him
 ” paulitte beuro ke ek sadsy kehete hai, “unheen kii vajah se bahumat main hote hue bhi kerala ikai ne haar maan lee
 Mishra had said on joining hands with the five-decade-old enemies of the alliance's craftsmen, "mamata's rule is so bad that a huge coalition of the people had to be formed
" koi bhi unke saath rahanaa nahin chahta, yahaan tak ki unke apane log unhen chhodkar ja rahe hai
 This is his biggest achievement
 ” doctor ke aisa kehane par shrotaaon main tahaakaa foot padataa he
 What is more surprising then is that Mamata has strongly urged the voters of her hometown Narayangarh, from where she is contesting elections
 tiemasi kii mukhiya ne yahaan apni prachaar sabha main kaha tha, “agar aap surya ko haraa dete ho to aap jo chaahoge main duungi
 If i become the Chief Minister again, i will start my victory rally from here
 main aapaki mehmaan rahuungi or khaas daler-bora (daal ke pakora) khaauungi
 (in return, Surya said that he would love to host Banerjee and arrange the feast, but only when he came to Narayangarh after losing the election
 )mamata kii naaraazgi samaj main aane vaali he
 Being the "architect of the alliance" who is "twisting the neck of the Trinamool" (left-congress vote share of 38 per cent and TMC 39 per cent since 2014), Surya Babu is the target of his words
 mamata is “aniatik gathbandhan” par berahami se hamale karti rahi hai
 She says, "this is not a jot (coalition), it is ghont (gangbing)
" sipiem apni vichaardhaara, apni disha to ganvaa hi chuki he or ab jab usne congress kaa daaman tham liya he, vah apana pataa bhi ganvaa baithegi

 "even Mamata's favorite slogan is" Cold forehead cool-cool, Aabar Ashbe Trinamool ", her reply is" cool forehead cool-cool, Jale Jabe Trinamal ", pointing to TMC leaders' involvement in Narada and Sarada scams
 logon ko isamen khub majaa aa rahaa he
 People are heard in tea shops and local trains saying, "cool-cool-cool-cool, Ebar Harbe Trinamool

 Being the star campaigner of the Left parties, Suryakant Mishra is measuring the entire state and will address about 100 rallies
 ek ke baad ek raily main ve logon se kehete hai, “netaa to aate or jate rahete hai, magar log sabase upar hai
 i am here only because of you
 ” harek raily ke saath ye awaajen kuch or tej, kuch or majboot ho jaati hai
 Surya has made the "people's coalition" (this new name because the left democratic secular front is much more complex) and more liberal and open to everyone, irrespective of their political complexion, under one roof
 Has given an open invitation to come

 He says, "the left cadre, which went into the shell after TMC attacks on itself, is coming out again in large numbers
" ab ve dare hue nahin hai
 Despite the heat and terror, the huge crowd proves that people are desperate for change
 jot to yahi ummid karegaa ki yah baat matganana ke din sahi nikle
 As a doctor's politician, Suryakant, as a medical student at Udayakatak University, tried a bit in politics, but there was no seriousness in it
 pashchim midanapur ke unke ek dost kehete hai, “ve achche lekhak the or siyaasi parachon-patrikaon ke liye matter taiyaar karte the
 His interest in politics grew when he came in contact with freedom fighter Sukumar Sengupta during his medical practice in Midnapore

 His image is of that Bengali Bhadra Purusha who has no ill feelings towards anyone

 They can be seen taking long puffs of beedi, eating plain rice and leafy vegetables, or eating murin-chop, a breakfast in Midnapore and walking around in loose-fitting kurta-pajamas or busht-trousers
 pashchim midanapur ke unke puraane dost or commered anil paatra kehete hai, “surya ke paas computer kaa dimag he
 They can also remember 30 years old things as if they had just happened yesterday

 Due to the resignation of these mlas, the equation of Karnataka Legislative Assembly seems to be changing completely
 haalanki spikar ne abhi tak istife sweekaar nahin kiye hai, lekin baagi vidhayakon ke tevar dekhakar ashankaon ke badal gahraate ja rahe hai
 At the moment, in the equation that is being formed, the BJP seems to be just one step away from the majority figure
 13 vidhayakon ke istife ke baad vidhansabha kaa sameekaran bataata he ki agar naaraaz vidhayak nahin maane to bijepi ke liye raste behad aasaan ho jaaenge
 The 225-member Assembly of Karnataka, which was increasing BJP, had 118 mlas in favor of the coalition government

 This includes 79 mlas of Congress (including the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly), 37 of JDS and three other mlas
 teen anya vidhayakon main ek bahujan samaaj party (basapa) se, ek karnataka pragnyavantha janata party (kepijepi) se or ek nirdaleey vidhayak he
 The BJP has 105 mlas sitting in the opposition
 ek nirdaleey vidhayak ke bhi bijepi ke samarthan main utar jane se bijepi kaa aankada badhkar 106 ho gaya he
 The BJP has been consistently claiming that most of the rebels are in contact with them
 karnataka bijepi ke adhyaksh yediurppa ne mangalvaar ko daawa kiya tha ki bijepi ke paas 107 vidhayakon kaa samarthan he
 The Kumaraswamy government is in the minority, so Chief Minister Kumaraswamy should resign from his post
 bijepi ke vidhayak dal ne mangalvaar ko ek ke baad ek kai baithken kii hai
 The political equations being created, it is believed that the Congress and JDS coalition government will fall

 Jaitley further said, "the government has no problem with any investigating agency in this case, because there is no one whom the government wants to protect
" aise main jo bhi naam saamne aaenge unki jaanch hogi or kanoon ke anusaar unhen dandit kiya jayega
 Jaitley said that the government also wants such a process to be adopted so that other countries continue to cooperate with India

 In the recent monsoon session of Parliament, Minister of State for Home Kiren Rijiju had said, 'the current guidelines of the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) or National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) do not explain which disaster was declared a' national disaster '
 Go 'dasven vitt ayog (1995-2000) ke saamne vichaar ke liye yah prastaav aayaa tha ki kisi aapadaa ko 'asaadhaaran prachandta kii rashtriya aapadaa' (gambhir rashtriya aapadaa) ghoshit kiya ja saktaa he, yadi yah rajya kii ek-tihaai jansankhya ko prabhavit karti ho
 The Commission accepted this, but did not decide what would be called a 'disaster of extraordinary intensity'
 lekin ayog ne kaha ki yah cese tu cese par nirbhar hoga yani alag-alag maamalon ke hisaab se tay kiya ja saktaa he
 The cloudburst in Uttarakhand and the cyclone Hudhud were declared such a disaster

 According to preliminary information, this fire is due to a short circuit
 haadase main tent or anya saamaan jal gaye hai

 The up assembly election result of Uttar Pradesh has questioned the existence of Congress
 congress ne behatar pradarshan ke liye sapa se gathjod kiya, is gathbandhan ke peeche khud rahul gandhi kii ahm bhoomika thi
 He himself took part in the election campaign this time
 lekin parinaam ne upi main rahul kii ranneeti or congress ke vajood par sawaal khadey kar diya he
 We are using the word existence because the Congress fielded candidates for a total of 105 seats, Amethi and Rae Bareli have been Congress strongholds for years
 lekin is vidhansabha chunaav main congress ko mahaj 7 siton par jeet milti dikh rahi he
 While bjp's ally 'apna Dal' (S), which is headed by Anupriya Patel, has 9 seats in its account
 yahaan rochak tathy ye he ki upi main apana dal ne keval 11 siton par apane ummidavaar utaare hai
 Till now the trends will be considered up election result, then Apna Dal is winning 9 out of 11 seats
 jabaki congress 105 siton par chunaav ladakar 7 siton par jitati dikhaai de rahi he
 That is, it can be said that the hold of Apna Dal (S) in Uttar Pradesh is more than that of Congress
 anupriya patel ne kaha ki gathbandhan par upi kii janata ne bharosa kiya he
 He credited this to PM Modi and the people of UP

 There was no pressure from the government to give these children

 yah sirf bharat kii hi baat nahin he
 This is discussed all over the world
 bharat main bhi kai cametiyaan baniin yah jaanane ke liye ki rigerv fund kitna ho

 chaurasia ne bhi is ghatana ko afvaah bataaya he
 He said, it was just a rumor, someone mischievously took a photo of the old crashed plane to the media and disturbed the administration
 chaurasia ne kaha, 'unke paas bhi ek media karmi nedurghatnagrast vimaanaki photo bheji thi, ab jaanch kii jaaegi ki patrkaar ko yah photo kisne bheji? sharaarat karne vaale ke khilaaf kadi karrwai kii jaaegi
 'it is noteworthy that at around one o'clock on Monday afternoon, there was a news in the media that a fighter aircraft had crashed in the forest of Kalda village in Chitrakoot district
 khabar ke saath durghatnagrast vimaan kii tasviir bhi jari hui thi
 After the news of this news, the staff of police officers started trying to find the debris of the plane in the jungle
 jab chitrakoot jile ke jangal main vimaan kaa malba nahin mila to yahaan kii police ne madhya pradesh ke satna jile ke police adheekshak se sampark kiya
 The authorities there also searched in the jungle of its border

 Tejas Hindustan owes it to the public sector company Hindustan Aeronautics Limited which handed over Tejas to the Indian Air Force last month
 tejas kaa nirmaan mig-21 or mig-23 ko riples karne ke liye kiya gaya he
 In the past, several mig-21 aircraft of the Indian Air Force have crashed
 haalanki mig-21 ko lagbhag 2017 main ritair hona he magar tejas vimaan ko banane main ho rahi deree kii vajah se ab isaki samay seemaa badhaakar 2025 kar di gayi he
 If seen, other countries have more modern fighter aircraft than India
 tejas abhi un sab ladaaku vimaanon se kai peeche he jiname mukhya taur par bich raste main eendhan bharna or lambi duuri tak missile le janaa hai
 Even the pilots do not have any specific knowledge about running them yet, due to which it is quite challenging for the new pilot to fly

 However, Air Chief Marshal PV Nayak, who was the Chief of the Air Staff in 2011, objected to this, saying that we will not include this aircraft in the Air Force until it is fully prepared to suit us

 Indian Railways has suffered losses of more than 78 thousand crores in the last three years
 vajah he ki yatriyon ko beche tikat se sanchaalan kii laagat hi nahin vasuul hui
 This was revealed in the reply given by the Minister of Railways and Commerce and Industry Piyush Goyal in the Lok Sabha
 unhone bataaya ki pichley teen varshon ke dauraan parichaalan laagat se kam yatri kiraaya hone ke kaaran railway ko haani hui he
 He said that there was a loss of 22,262 in 2015-16, 25,561 in 2016-17 and Rs 31,128 crore in 2017-18
 unhone bataaya ki desh kaa mahatvapurn parivahan ang hone ke kaaran bhartiya railway apane deshavaasiyon ke prati saamaajik seva daayitv ko puraa karti he
 Indian Railways is committed to provide transport facility to the poorer sections of society at a cheaper rate
 bhartiya railway aam janata ke hit main laagat se kam keemat par parivahan suvidhaayen uplabdh karaati he
 The Railway Minister said that as per tradition, the revenue earned in the freight sector is compensated through the process of cross subsidization
 iske alaava ek oktober 2014 se dianemic kiraye par premium tatkaal kota system bhi shuru hua he
 This resulted in the Railways earning about 603 crores in 2018-19
 darasal, 24 july ko loksabhaa main chaar saansadon ne poocha tha ki kya bhartiya railway yatriyon or anya sevaaon kii laagat ko puraa nahin kar paa rahi he, jis par rail mantri piyush goyal ne jawaab diya
 It is dangerous to call something crazy in the world as useless and useless
 lekin aapse gaaliyaan khaane kaa jokhim uthaa kar bhi aaj main yahi karne ja rahaa hum !ji haa, android phone ke tamaam Memory Cleaner, Memory Booster or Battery Saver Apps bekaar or phaltu hai
 Not only are they useless, but using them can sometimes result in loss rather than profit
 ab sawaal ye he ki phir kyon lakhon log google play store se in Apps ko na sirf downlod karte hai, balki ise shandaar bhi bataate hai?jawaab dene se pehle main kuch sawaal poochna chahta hum
 Does Ganesh ji drink milk? No no But didn't millions of people in the country and the world give milk to Ganesha once! Has salt ever run out in India till date? Then why not one, but many times, people bought several months worth of salt in the house on the rumor of ending salt! On the rumor of the bank being bankrupt, people took out all the money and brought it home, there was a long line at the ATM, it went bankrupt? Looks like
 lekin isse galat baat, sahi nahin ho jaati
 The Play Store is full of Memory Cleaner, Auto Apps Killer, Battery Saver Apps and Memory Booster which claim that if you download them to your phone, then in a blink of an eye it will make your phone fast and your phone's Battery will also last longer
 aise Apps hamen ye samajhane kii koshish karte hai ki phone kii memri (RAM) kaa phul hona, bekagranud main eps kaa chaalu rahanaa phone or betry kii sehat ke liye bahut bura he
 It seems good to hear that the more empty the memory, the faster the phone will run
 ye baat bhi ekadam thik lagati he ki agar phone ke bekagranud main bahut se Apps chhip kar chal rahe hai, istemaal na karne ke baavjood bhi puri tarah band nahin hue hai to ye betry pite rahenge
 Now in such a situation, someone will say that he will not only kill the apps running hidden in the backgroun, but himself, he will also keep checking at some time to see if these stubborn apps are started again
 It makes sense to listen
 bhai, na phaltu ke Apps bekagranud main chalegein, na android phone slo hoga na betry jaaegi! he na kamaal kii baat? ji nahin, bilkul bakawaas he ye baat! aaie, aapako bataata hum kyon
 The app's 'stay on' and 'running' completely different Android software is designed in such a way that all the apps can run faster using minimum power
 ab sabase pehle ye samajhnaa jaruri he ki android main kisi App kaa 'chaalu rahanaa' or 'chalanaa' bilkul alag-alag he
 Android phone uses its memory (RAM) in a completely different way
 jab aap kisi App kaa istemaal karke use band kar dete hai to wo puri tarah band hokar ghar jane ke bajaay, chupchaap vahiin memri kii bench par baith jaataa he
 Not one, one by one, do all the apps
 wo puri tarah band hokar apane ghar jane ke bajaae vahiin paas main memri naam kii bench par line lagaakar baithte jate hai
 Apps sitting on a memory bench do not cost any batteries, which you just closed the app immediately - it will be at the forefront of the line
 line laga kar baithne kaa ye silsilaa tab tak chalata he jab tak memri naam kii is bench par jagah hogi
 When the place starts running out, then the app will be the last in the line, that is, the one which you had closed first - it will now be completely closed and will go home
 jab aap phone par koi nayaa kaam shuru karte hai, jaise aapane koi nayaa game khelnaa shuru kar diya or uske liye memory kam padati he to line main baithe kuch Apps uske liye jagah banane kii khatir khud-ba-khud puri tarah band ho jate hai
 Before stating why Android does this, know that apps sitting silently on the memory bench don't spend any battery - none at all
 wo sirf chaalu dikhte bhar hai - chalate nahin hai
 Unless you run it
 ab sawaal ye uthta he ki wo puri tarah band hone ke bajaae memri kii bench par line lagaakar date hi kyon rahete hai ? aakhir tabhi to phone kii memri har samay lagbhag phul dikhti he jise khaali karne ke liye ye Memory Killer Apps istemaal karne padate hai
 Think of the answer as aapane ek taxi mangaai he jisase aapako din bhar kai jagah janaa he
 So what kind of driver would you like - the one who disappears after stopping the car again and again and every time you come, you have to call him, or the driver who will get you on the car seat every time? Android would do the same is
 jarurat nahin hone par wo Apps ko driver kii tarah memri kii seat par mustaid rakhata he taaki wo bulaate hi, yani us App kii phir se jarurat hone par fouran hajir ho sake
 Just as sitting on the driver's seat will not cost the petrol of the vehicle, similarly, just sitting in the memory of apps does not cost the battery
 isliye memri (RAM) kaa hameshaa phul dikhnaa bura nahin balki acha he
 If the apps are completely closed and restarted again, it will not only take time to open, but will continue to blow up the extra battery only on and off
 Apps Killer, Memory Booster, Battery Saver or Memory Cleaner yahi ulta kaam karte rahete hai - Memory main chupchaap baithe Apps ko band karke ghar bhejte rahete hai
 The amazing thing is that all such things also keep shutting down without which Android phone cannot run
 isliye kuch hi pal baad ye dubaara shuru ho jate hai
 And your beloved App Killer, Battery Saver, by shutting it down again, congratulates you on how much memory he has freed your phone
 Apps Killer - Memory Cleaner ke said iffecrub sawaal ye uthta he ki agar aisa he to phir kyon kuch logon ko vaaki in Apps ke istemaal se phayda hota he or unka phone behatar kaam karne lagata he? jawaab ye he ki kuch Battery Saver App, memri ko Kill karne ke alaava bhi kuch kaam kar dete hai
 For example, if not used, turn off GPS, Bluetooth, wifi, location services and increase the sync interval for many services using the Internet
 lekin ye kaam aap phone main pehle se maujuud power vijet kaa istemaal karke khud aasaani se, or behatar tareeke se kar sakate hai
 There is no need to hold a razor in the hands of a monkey named Apps Killer - Memory Cleaner for this small task
 kabhi aapane gaur kiya he ki ye Memory Booster, Memory Cleaner, Battery Saver jaisi cheez ko jab aap apane phone main daalate hai tab ye chupchaap aapse kya-kya karne kii Permission hasil kar leti hai ? ek baar phone inke hawaale hua nahin ki ye jane kab kya band kar den, phone main kya settings badal den, kya uda den
 Why buy such trouble without talking
 agar aap betry bachaana chaahate hai to is baat kii pahchaan karen ki koun se Apps betry kii sabase zyada khapat kar rahe hai
 If not needed, instead of turning them off repeatedly, uninstall and remove them from the phone itself
 hataanaa sambhav na ho to Disable kar den
 Smart phone is also a computer, so at least twice a week, shut it down and restart
 betry bachaane ke bare main vistaar se jaananaa ho to is link par jaakar padh sakate hai
 In the end, keep this in mind - we are just saying Memory Cleaner and Battery Saver Apps
 phone main jamaa kachare ko saaf karne ke liye jo Cache Cleaner Apps hai jinka kaam bekaar or chhipi hui puraani Files ko hataanaa he-unka istemaal karne main koi harj nahin he

 The BJP has given tickets to such old people, who do not even know the face of politics, in the compulsion to cut old candidates, but the hope of winning them is based on the fact that if the father's name is supported, then he will leave
 tikat mila to nikaleen baharabijepi ne kolayat seat se punam kanvar ko pratyaashee banaaya he
 In place of Kolayat's strong BJP leader Devi Singh Bhati, the party has made her daughter-in-law its candidate
 punam kabhi ghar se nahin nikaleen isliye ghunghat uthaaya nahin
 Now that he has got a ticket in place of father-in-law, then there is a compulsion to leave the house, so he has to go in the veil
 darasal, devi singh bhaati kolayat seat se damdaar netaa rahe hai lekin pichhali baar vah haar gaye to kah diya ki ab aage or chunaav nahin ladenge
 Both of his sons have died in the accident, so if there is no one left in the house, the daughter was given the ticket
 ghunghat ke andar se baat karte hue punam kanvar ne kaha ki ghunghat rajput mahilaon kii pratha he, lekin isse kaam karne main koi dikkat nahin hogi
 In the Lok Sabha, there was still a ticket, in addition to the ticket, Poonam Kanwar, Ramswaroop Lamba, son of Union Minister Sanwarlal Jat, has been fielded by BJP from Nasirabad Assembly seat
 saanvarlaal jat kii maut ho gai to unhen ajmer loksabhaa kaa tikat de diya
 Defeated by more than one lakh but the party has renounced the father's seat
 ramswarup lamba ko tikat kyon diya gaya he jabaki unhen ek line dhang bolne nahin aata
 When asked the question, he starts looking around
 koi kabhi bagal main khadaa kaan main bataata he to kabhi pados main khadey vyakti se puch lene kii baat karte hai
 Apart from ticketing 15 relatives, BJP from Jodhpur city has given ticket to Atul Bhansali, nephew of 6-time MLA Kailash Bhansali
 chachaa buudhe ho gaye to bhattije maidan main aa gaye
 There is no relationship with the public far and wide, so with the help of God, we have started walking around the Ganesh temple to cross the boat
 atul bhansaali se jab poocha gaya ki kyon tikat mil gaya to unhone kaha ki papa or chachaa 40 varshon se raajnneeti main the isliye ham bhi aa gaye
 The BJP released the first list of 131 candidates for which 25 sitting mlas had forked tickets, but gave tickets to 15 leaders' sons and relatives in their place
 sardul shahar se bijepi ke vidhayak gurjant singh ke pote gurbir singh pahaad ko tikat diya gaya he

 lekin kuch ummidavaar aise bhi hai jinke bete-beti nahin he yaa phirapariwaar main tiktalene vaala koi nahin he
 In such a situation, only the elderly leader above 80 years has been given ticket, which is not even run properly now

 More than 150 children have died within the last 20 days from unknown disease in hospitals in Muzaffarpur, Gaya and Patna in Bihar
 kuch chikitsak is beemaari ko 'acute inseflitis syndrome' kah rahe hai, jabaki haal main dilli se ai neshnal centre for dijis control kii chah sadasyeey visheshgy team lagaataar beemaari ko lekar adhyayan kar rahi he
 The disease has so far spread in ten districts of the state, due to which the government has stopped the leave of doctors in all these districts
 rajya ke mujffarpur sthit shrikrishna medical college aspataal (eskeems) main ab tak 30 se zyada or kejariwal aspataal main 60 se zyada marijon kii maut ho chuki he
 Significantly, children up to the age of fifteen years are falling prey to this disease

 According to physicians, the main symptom of this disease is high fever, vomiting-diarrhea, fainting and intermittent tremor in the body parts
 rajya ke swasthya mantri ashvini choube ne kaha he ki mritkon kii sankhya main badhotaree kaa mukhya kaaran marijon kaa der se aspataal pahunchnaa he
 They say that in view of the disease, a control room has been set up in Muzaffarpur, where an ambulance has also been arranged
 unhone kaha ki prabhavit jilon ke chikitsakon ko team banaakar gaanvon main daura karne or marijon ko tatkaal aspataal bhejne kii vyavastha karne kaa nirdesh diya gaya he
 Many doctors are calling this disease as 'acute encephalitis syndrome', but despite the specimen examination or lab test done so far, the disease has not been identified correctly
 is kaaran chikitsak beemaari kii sateek dawa bhi tay nahin kar paa rahe hai
 Gyan Bhushan, a civil surgeon from Muzaffarpur, says that a six-member expert team from the National Center for Disease Control, which came from Delhi, arrived at SKMCH and conducted a case study of several victims
 kai marijon kaa emarai or city scan bhi karaayaa gaya
 Also some samples are being sent to Delhi and Poona
 team prabhavit ilaakon kaa bhi daurakar report ikattha kar rahi he
 It is noteworthy that the Bihar government has announced a compensation of Rs 50,000 each to the parents of all the children who died of the disease

 ) The opposition has slammed the government for the terrorist attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama sector
 mangalvaar ko loksabhaa main pulavama hamale kaa mudda uthaa, to congress saansad jyotiraditya sindhiya ne is mudde par pradhanmantri narendra modi kii chuppi par sawaal khadey kiye
 In the Lok Sabha, Scindia said that the government is repeating the mistake again and again, nothing is being done to protect the soldiers on the border
 pradhanmantri narendra modi is baat par chup kyon hai
 He said that again and again terrorists are crossing this border, what is the central government doing
 is dauraan sindhiya ne kaha ki jo log pehle baaten kiya karte the ki ham ek ke badale das sir laaenge, pakistan ko munhtod jawaab denge
 What happened to that promise, now why are those people sitting in silence
 sushamaa swaraj ne diya tha bayaanapako bataa den ki 8 janvari 2013 main jab upie sarkaar kaa shashan tha
 During that time, Pakistan Army had beheaded two soldiers including Lance Nayak Hemraj of Indian Army
 jab is ghatana par jamkar bavaal hua tha
 Then the Leader of the Opposition, Sushma Swaraj, while giving a statement on this incident, said that the Indian government should take strong action against Pakistan
 sushamaa ne kaha tha ki bharat ko ek ke badale pakistani sena ke javaanon ke 10 sir laane chahie
 During that time, politics was intensified on this statement of Sushma
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaavon ke dauraan bhi bhartiya sena ke javaanon ke sir kaate jane kaa mudda chunaav prachaar kaa mudda bana tha
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi also said in rallies that Pakistan is beheading our soldiers and the government is feeding chicken biryani to the Pakistani PM
 aapako bataa den ki saal 2017 ke aakhri din jammu-kashmir ke pulavama main bada aatanki hamalaa hua tha
 In this terror attack, 5 soldiers were killed, while 3 terrorists were killed
 pulavama main ye encounter kareeb 36 ghante tak chalaa tha
 The terrorist organization jaish-e-mohammed was responsible for this attack
 pichley kuch samay se charchaa thi ki sanjay lila bhansaali salmaan khan or aalia bhatta ke saath ek film banane ja rahe hai
 The fans of both the stars were very excited about this, but due to the lack of agreement on the script between Salman and Bhansali, this project remained incomplete
 haalanki bhansaali ne aalia bhatta ke saath apane project kaa elaan kar diya he or ye role shaayad aalia bhatta ke kariyar kaa sabase chunauteepurn role hone ja rahaa he
 Sanjay Leela Bhansali has announced his new film 'gangubai Kathaiwadi'
 is film menalia bhattalid role main najar aaengi
 The film will be released on 11 September 2020

 aalia kaa hoga damdaar kirdaaris film kii puri cast ke bare main ab tak khulaasa nahin ho paaya he
 However, it is believed that Alia can play a challenging role of Gangubai in this film
 reports ke anusaar, gangubai ko madar of anderworld dons bhi kaha jaataa tha
 It is also said in the reports that this woman used to run a brothel and in addition to the drugs business, she was also involved in contract killing business

 Significantly, before this, Alia was going to do the film Inshallah with Bhansali
 ye pehali baar tha ki aalia bhatta, salmaan or bhansaali sang kaam karatin
 According to a report, Alia Bhatt had turned down a film with Aamir Khan to work with salman-bhansali but ultimately the film could not be made due to a creative dispute between Salman and Bhansali, which obviously caused a lot of disappointment for Alia

 The International Boxing Federation (ABA) overturned Indian boxer Vikas Krishnan (69 kg) decision to win the prequarter finals after a review that left Vikas out of the London Olympics
 20 varshiya vikaas ne shuukravaar raat romaanchak mukaable main irol spence ko 13-11 se haraaya tha lekin pratidwandvi team prabandhan kii ore se daayar apil par faisle kii samiksha karne ke baad eba ne america mukkebaaz ko 15 
 Declared the winner by 13
 eba ne pratiyogita jeuri dwaara is bout kii samiksha karne ke baad bayaan main kaha ki ‘ratiya mukkebaaz ne keval tisare daur main hi nau foul kiye the
 However the referee gave only one warning

 However the referee did not give any warning
 in nishkarshon ke aadhaar par jeuri sadasyon ne sarvasammati se spence ko chaar ank dene kaa faisla kiya jisase vah vijeta ho jate hai
 Aiba said the referee should have given at least two warnings to the Indian boxer
 isamen kaha gaya ki america mukkebaaz ko kam se kam chaar ank or milane chahie the
 Therefore the final score should be 15-13 in favor of the American boxer
 virodh ko sweekaar kiya jaataa he or america mukkebaaz spence ko vijeta ghoshit kiya jaataa he
 Vikas, the only bronze medalist after Vijender at the World Championships, was considered to be a big medal hope for the country
 gauratlab he ki landan olympic main mukkebaaji spardhaaen kai baar vivaadon main raheen hai or eba kii scoring pranali kii kadi aalochana hui he
 India has also protested against the decision to defeat Sumit Sangwan (81 kg) but India's appeal was rejected
 loksabhaa adhyaksh ke taur par bijepi saansad om birla ne jimmedaari sambhaal lee he
 When the BJP decided to make second-time MP Om Birla a speaker, this time, not giving preference to the experience, everyone was shocked as Sumitra Mahajan, who was an 8-time MP in 2014, was made the speaker
 saath hi is baar spikar kii res main birla kaa naam dur-dur tak nahin tha
 But when Om Birla became Lok Sabha Speaker on Wednesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi made it clear in his speech why he gave this important responsibility to Birla
 rajasthan ke kota se duusari baar saansad chune gaye om birla ko adhyaksh banane kaa pehla prastaav piem modi ne hi loksabhaa main rakhaa or sadan ke upanetaa rajnath singh ne is prastaav kaa anumodan kiya
 After this, Birla has been unanimously elected as the Chairman by voice
 vaise to aise kareeb 10 prastaav endie ke netaaon ne birla ke samarthan main rakhe the lekin khaas baat rahi ki congress or tiemasi jaise dalon ne bhi birla ko adhyaksh banane kaa samarthan kiya
 Prime Minister Modi congratulated Birla on becoming the speaker and also appreciated his contribution in politics
 piem modi ne kaha ki sadan ke liye yah mahaan garv kii baat he
 We congratulate Birla ji on being unanimously elected as the Lok Sabha Speaker
 kai saansad birla ji ko acchhee tarah jaanate hai, unhone rajasthan main bhi apni sevaayen di hai
 He excelled in social service, said, "I personally remember the experience of working with Birla ji for a long time
 ve kota ke pratinidhi hai, shiksha or adhyayan kii bhoomi kota mini india he jo shiksha kaa kaashi ban gaya he
 The PM said that Birla ji's contribution in the development of quota is also very high
 ve kai saalon se saarvajanik jivan main hai, unhone chaatr netaa ke rup main shuruyaat kii tab se bina ruke samajaseva kar rahe hai
 PM Modi said that Birla ji has worked in the organization for about 15 years, starting with student politics
 unhone kaha ki bijepi kaaryakarta, chaatr netaa ke taur par unhone jile, rajya or raashtra str par kaam kiya he
 Recalling Birla's social work, PM Modi said that he is not in politics as a public representative but kept working on social work style
 gujarat ke bukamp main birla ke yogadan ko yaad karte hue piem modi ne kaha ki vah lambey samay tak kuccha main rahe or apane saathiyon ko bhi vahaan ke logon kii madad ke liye laae
 They did social service in their own way even without local system
 iske baad kedarnath traasadee ke vakt bhi vah toli ke saath vahaan seva main jute rahe
 The PM said that even in Kota, on the winter night, Birla Ji used to distribute blankets and has started a campaign to feed the hungry people
 paridhaan yojana ke jariye birla ji ne garib logon ko kapade muhaiyaa karaane kaa kaam kiya he
 Fearing this, PM Modi said that Om Birla ji smiles very lightly and speaks lightly
 piem modi ne kaha ki mujhe kabhi-kabhi dar lagata he ki koi sadan main unke vivek or namrata kaa durupyog na kar le
 PM Modi said that now running the Lok Sabha is easier than running the Rajya Sabha when earlier it used to be the opposite
 is maukey par piem modi ne purv spikar sumitra mahajan ke kaarykaal kii bhi saraahna kii
 It is clear that the decision to make Om Birla a speaker is not based on his experience but because of his efficiency and strong hold in the organization
 vah sanghathan ke majboot kaaryakarta hone kii vajah se bade netaaon ke kareebi rahe or bijepi ne bhi is baat sanket de diya ki pad anubhav ke naam par nahin balki kaam ke naam par diya jayega

 jahaan ek ore khud ko chaukeedaar kah rahe pradhanmantri narendra modi hai, to duusari ore congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi kii aguwai main gandhi parivaar he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi is constantly targeting the Gandhi family and Congress leaders are attacking him
 ab gandhi parivaar par narendra modi ke hamale kaa jawaab dete-dete congress ke netaa pisi chaako ne gandhi parivaar ko desh kaa pratham parivaar bataa daalaa he
 He says that the country where it stands today is due to this first family
 desh ko gandhi parivaar kaa abhaari hona chahie
 During a conversation with news agency ANI on Saturday, Congress leader PC Chacko said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's views on India's first family are negative
 gandhi parivaar sach main desh kaa pratham parivaar he
 India should be grateful to this first family
 congress netaa chaako ne kaha ki pradhanmantri narendra modi antariksh main maar karne kii kshamta viksit karne kii baat karte hai, jabaki hakeekat yah he ki bharat pandit jawahar laal nehru ke netritv or planning kii vajah se yahaan tak pahunchaa he
 The Congress leader also claimed that Prime Minister Narendra Modi does not know about the history of India
 unhone kaha ki narendra modi ko is baat kaa pataa nahin he ki jab bharat aaazaad hua tha, tab yahaan kaise halaat the? jawahar laal nehru ke shasankaal main harith kranti or shwet kranti se desh aatmanirbhar bana tha
 He said that the contribution of Gandhi family in making the country cannot be erased
 is dauraan chaako ne yah bhi daawa kiya ki rahul gandhi bharat ke agle pradhanmantri banenge or narendra modi aisa hote dekhenge
 The BJP attacked the Congress sharply, while the Bharatiya Janata Party attacked the Congress, saying that there are parties of familyism in this country, but now the thing has gone even further
 aaj congress ke netaa kah rahe hai ki gandhi parivaar ko desh pratham parivaar maan le
 It is a threat to democracy
 aapako bataa den ki desh kii 58 kendriya yojanaayen nehru-gandhi parivaar ke naam par hai
 Over 450 items are names of Gandhi family
 iske alaava sangh ke vichaarak sangeet raagi ne kaha ki is desh main ek parivaar ke naam par political aaikengraphy kii gai he
 He said that the statement of PC Chacko is a great insult to democracy
 loktantr main pratham parivaar hota hi nahin he
 He said that the Congress party is a family party and there has always been a transfer of power within it
 kahaan hota he pratham parivaar?congress netaa pisi chaako dwaara gandhi parivaar ko hindustan kaa pratham parivaar bataane ke baad se is mudde par bahes chhid gai he
 Now the question here is that how is the Gandhi family the first family in India? Where is the first family? Let me tell you that where there is a monarchy, there is a first family
 britain, japan or saudi arab jaise 28 deshon main pratham parivaar he
 In a democracy like India, there is a first citizen and not a first family
 ab kai rajshahi vaale deshon main loktantric sarkarein hai, lekin rajshahi vaale deshon main sirf pratham parivaar se hi desh ke pramukh hote hai
 This devotion of the Gandhi family to Congress leaders gives Narendra Modi a chance to attack them

 The CISF deputy commandant says that the security of INS Virat, standing for repairs at the Cochin Shipyard in Kochi, has been beefed up and the jawans are alert

 katrina-aditya's 'fitoor' is directed by Abhishek Kapoor, who has made films like 'rock On' and 'kay Poche' before it
 yah film charles dekan ke nowell 'da great expectations' par aadhaarit he
 It stars Tabu, Aditya Roy Kapur, Katrina Kaif, Lara Dutta, Aditi Rao Hydari, Rahul Bhatt
 mehmaan bhoomika main hai, ajay devgan
 Talking about the film's story, there is the palace of Begum Hazrat in the Valley of Kashmir where she lives with shan-o-shaukat with her paradise
 duusari ore he nur jo apni bahan or jija ke saath rahata he or jija ke kaam main unki madad karata he
 Along with this, Noor is also an amazing artist who has wanted Firdaus since childhood
 bachapan kaa pyaar vakt ke saath javaan hota he par mushkilon ke saath
 Now to know what are these difficulties, you will have to watch the film
 baat film kii khoobiyon or khaamiyon kii karen to sabase pehle lagata he lekhak suprathik sen or nirdeshak abhishek kapur nowell 'da great expectations' ko 2 ghante 10 minute kii film main puri tarah se dhaal nahin paae, jisaki vajah se film pehle bhaag main dhili padati he
 An attempt has been made to push the story through the difficulties of Kashmir, but even if these difficulties were not seen, it would not have been lost because at the end of the film, you might have felt that you had to step on the path which was not to walk? bina gaharaai ko chhue kisi pahalu ko dikhaane se darshak bhatak sakate hai
 The film is a love story but Ishq's passion is less visible in the script
 gane achche hai par pashmina gaanaa mujhe kisi vigyaapan kii tarah laga
 The weakest link of director Abhishek Kapoor's 'fitoor' is its reverse-multi-script
 vaadiyaan beintahaa khubasurat hai par kahani feeki-si dikhaai padati he
 The story seems unable to fully cache the characters
 kirdaaron ke rishton ko lekar asamanjas bana rahata he kuch kadiyaan uljhi dikhti hai
 The comments baat khoobiyon kii karen to sabase badi khubi he anay goswami kii cinemetographi, jisaki jitani taareef kii jaae kam he
 Every frame is amazing, the emotions are captured in the camera in the best way
 film kii raftaar aapako dhimi lag sakati he par mujhe isamen tehraav dikhataa he
 According to the theme of the film, it has its pace
 tabboo ne ek baar phir kamaal kaa abhinay kiya he
 At the same time, the character of Rahul Bhatt leaves his mark
 parde par katrina ke bachapan kaa kirdaar nibhaa raheen tunisha sharma kaa aatmavishvaas dekhte banataa he
 The style of Aditya Roy Kapoor's dialogue was amazing in many places
 agar katrina ke lahaze ko nazarandaaz karen to vah apane kirdaar main thik hai
 The background score handles the sophistication of the film
 film main costum or production dizin bhi mujhe acha laga jo film kii shaan qaayam rakhata he phir chaahe wo begham hazrat kaa luk ho yaa phir nur or uske parivaar kaa
 3 stars from my film film kii kahani ke bare main baat karen to kashmir kii vaadiyon main begum hazrat kaa mahal he jahaan vah apni firdaus ke saath shaan-o-shaukat ke saath rahati hai
 On the other side is Noor who lives with his sister and brother-in-law and helps him in brother-in-law's work
 iske saath hi nur ek kamaal kaa artist bhi he, jo firdaus ko bachapan se chahta he
 Childhood love happens with time, but with difficulties
 ab ye mushkilen koun-koun si hai, ye jaanane ke liye aapako film dekhni padegi
 Talking about the merits and demerits of the film, first of all it seems that writer Supratik Sen and director Abhishek Kapoor could not completely adapt the novel 'the Great Expectations' in a 2 hour and 10 minute film, due to which the film was loose in the first part
 is
 kashmir kii mushkilon ke jariye kahani ko aage badhaane kii koshish kii gai he par ye mushkilen na bhi dikhti to harz nahin tha kyonki film khatm hote hi shaayad aapako lage ki jis raah par chalanaa nahin tha vahaan kadam rakhane kii zarurat kyon padi? Showing an aspect without touching the depth can cause the viewer to wander

 The songs are good but i liked the Pashmina song like an advertisement
 nirdeshak abhishek kapur kii 'fitur' kii sabase kamazor kadi he isaki ulti-pulti script
 The plays are extremely beautiful, but the story seems bleak
 kirdaaron ko puri tarah se cash kar paane main kahani naakaam si dikhaai padati he
 Confusion about the relationships of the characters remains, some of the links seem complicated
 tippaniyan Talking about the merits, the biggest feature is the cinematography of Anay Goswami, which is less appreciated
 har frem kamaal kaa he, imoshans behtareen tareeqe se camere main qaid kiye gaye hai
 The speed of the film may seem slow to you, but i find it stagnant
 film ke vishay ke mutabik, iskaa pes he
 Tabu has once again performed amazing
 vahiin rahul bhatta kaa kirdaar apni chhap chodta he
 The confidence of Tunisha Sharma, playing the role of Katrina's childhood on the screen, is seen
 aditya roy kapur ke dialog bolne kaa andaaz kai jagah kamaal kaa laga
 If i ignore the accent of Katrina, then she is fine in her character
 becoground score film kii nazaakat ko sambhalata he
 i also liked the costume and production design in the film, which holds the pride of the film, whether it is the look of Begum Hazrat or Noor and his family

 chunaav nateezon main bispi ko 10 to espi ko sirf 5 siton par jeet mili thi, jabaki pashchimi upi kii party RLD ko ek bhi seat par jeet hasil nahin ho pai thi

 New politics of vote bank Girls dance is common in rural areas of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar during any function, but it is illegal to use them to increase vote bank in elections

 Used to send his clients for sexual abuse

 Although such dances are common in rural areas, the matter of physical abuse during this period is surprising

 To play with a girl's respect for a few votes is definitely not worth tolerating

 -input language eimm adhyaksh asaduddin ovaisi (asaduddin Owaisi) ne loksabhaa chunaav ke chathe charan se thik pehle piem modi par ek baar phir hamalaa bolaa he
 He on Saturday reminded Prime Minister Narendra Modi (PM Modi) of the 2002 riots in Gujarat
 bataa den ki isse pehle modi ne 1984 main sikh virdohi dangon ko kathith taur par 'bhayaavah jansanhaar' qaraar diya tha
 Owaisi (asaduddin Owaisi) said in a tweet that during his tenure as the Chief Minister of Gujarat, Modi had failed in his constitutional duty to protect life
 shriman pradhanmantri vaise hi 2002 ke dange bhi the jo mukhyamantri ke taur par aapke kaarykaal ke dauraan hue the or aap maanav jivan kii raksha karne ke apane sanvaidhanik shapath main vifal rahe the
 Owaisi (asaduddin Owaisi) is contesting again from Hyderabad Lok Sabha constituency from where he is currently an MP
 unhone kaha ki maamalon ke aropiyon ne 1984 or 2002 main chunaav jite
 The AIMIM chief was referring to Modi's attack on Congress over the remarks of Congress leader Sam Pitroda on the 1984 anti-sikh riots
 pitroda ne bhaajapa par "sachai tod marodakar pesh karne" kaa aarope lagaaya tha or kaha tha ki is chunaav main ateet kii chijen praasangik nahin hai
 Significantly, this is not the first time Owaisi has targeted PM Modi
 isse pahalisduddin ovaisi (asaduddin Owaisi) ne pulavama aatankwaadi hamale ko lekar pradhanmantri narendra modi (PM Narendra Modi) par nishaanaa saadhaa tha or poocha ki kya vah 'bif biryani khaakar so gaye the', jabaki siarpief ke 40 jawan shahid ho gaye
 Asaduddin's younger brother and party MLA Akbaruddin Owaisi also targeted PM Modi for his 'main Bhi Chowkidar' campaign and said that if the Prime Minister wants to become a watchman, he will give him the watchman's cap and whistle
 hyderabad ke saansad asaduddin ne yahaan ek chunavi sabha ko sambodhit karte hue grahamantri rajnath singh ke us bayaan ko rekhaankit kiya tha ki neshnal technical research argenigeshan (antiaro) ne pakistan ke balakot main bhartiya vayusena ke ladaaku vimaanon dwaara hawaii hamale se pehle vahaan kareeb 300 ‘sakriy' mobile phone hone kaa pataa lagaaya tha
 Asaduddin Owaisi had asked that 'I want to ask Rajnath Singh and Prime Minister Modi that if NTRO can see about 300 mobile phones in Balakot, then sitting in Delhi, you could not see how 50 kg RDX
 Brought to Pulwama ''
 unhone kaha, tha ki ‘aapaki naak ke neeche 50 kilogram ardex pulavama main laayaa gaya
 Couldn't you see it Were you asleep Did you eat biryani? ho saktaa he ki aapane bif biryani khaayi ho or so gaye hon
 Here 40 of our people were martyred '
 14 farvari ko dakshin kashmir ke pulavama main ek aatankwaadi hamale main siarpief ke 40 jawan shahid ho gaye the
 All India majlis-e-ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) MLA Akbaruddin, representing Chandrayangutta seat in the old city, mocked the Prime Minister's watchman campaign
 unhone kaha tha ki ‘‘main ‘modi bhakton' par or modi ko vot karne waalon par hairaan hum
 Sometimes Modi becomes a chaiwala and sometimes a fakir
 unhone kaha tha ki ‘‘main narendra modi se kahana chahta hum ki aap ek ‘chywala' the or janata ne aapako pradhanmantri banaaya or ab aap kah rahe hai ki aap ek chaukeedaar hai
 Whose janitor? i am not on social media
 mere ek mitra ne twitor par chaukeedaar narendra modi, chaukeedaar amit shah ke bare main dikhaaya'
 Akbaruddin said that "why is the watchman only on Twitter?" Put the watchman on Aadhar card, Votercard and Narendra Modi's passport as well
 aapako bataa den ki aam chunaav se pehle bhaajapa ne ‘main bhi chaukeedaar' abhiyaan tej kar diya he or modi ke saath hi party adhyaksh amit shah sahit sabhi varisht netaaon ne apane twitor handle main ‘‘chaukeedaar'' shabd jod liya he

 bhartiya janata party daliton hiton kii suraksha kaa daawa karte hue nahin thak rahi he, lekin kamjor samaaj par hamale ke adhiktar maamle bhaajapa shasit rajyon main hi dekhne ko mil rahe hai
 The new case is from Gurugram in Haryana
 sibar city ke vazirpur gaanv main shuukravaar der ratsavarna jatike logon ne dalit pariwaron par hamalaa bol diya
 In fact, there was a lot of controversy about the fact that the people of Rajput community of Wazirpur village attacked with sticks with sticks in the Dalit colony
 gurugram police ne dalit samaaj ke pariwaron kii shikaayat par maamla darj kar jaanch shuru kii he
 Although the villagers somehow managed to negotiate late in the evening and tried their best to reach a compromise on both sides, the people of the upper castes probably got angry and after the late evening quarrel, they went to the Dalit colony about 3 times till morning
 Created
 police ke mutabik basti kii dukaanon ko aag se jalaane kii koshishen kii gai
 Vehicles parked there were vandalized, and lawless miscreants continued to use racist words in public
 shikaayat ke baad harakat main ai police ne maamle par saaf taur se bolne kii jagah maamle kii tafteesh kii baat kahi he
 However the investigation of the case continues
 bataa den ki yah vahi vajirpur gaanv he jisamen kii bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) ke jila adhyaksh bhupinder singh chouhan, bhaajapa ke laa parshad chairmen kalyansingh chouhan rahete hai
 However, political pressure in the case cannot be denied
 lekin is hamale se ek baar phir daliton kii suraksha vyavastha par sawaal khadey ho gaye hai
 The Supreme Court lashed out at the Enforcement Directorate for being blinded to the filing of a charge sheet against Pune-based horse trader Hasan Ali Khan for alleged white money
 nyaayalay ne is samvedansheel maamle kii jaanch kii nigaraanee ke liye sarkaar kii ore se gathit ucch stareey samiti ke kaamkaaj par bhi sawaal khadaa kiya
 The apex court had expressed its displeasure during the hearing of the case on May 4, when the Enforcement Directorate presented a status report related to the investigation into the black money case involving Khan and others, but did not mention that Mumbai The chargesheet will be filed before the special court on 6 May
 ucchtam nyaayalay kaledhan se jude maamalon kii nigaraanee kar rahaa he
 In the case of Hasan Ali, a bench of Justice b Sudarshan Reddy and Justice SS Nijjar asked, "why have you not informed us that the investigation against Hasan Ali has been completed
" aapane (pravartan nideshaalay) ne apni sthiti report main kaha he ki jaanch chal rahi he
 Two days later, we read in the newspapers that you have filed the charge sheet
 hamaare liye aapatti jataana aavashyak he
 The Supreme Court bench also wondered why the charge sheet was not presented before the high-level committee set up by the government
 nyaayalay ne kaha, hamane sochaa tha ki aise sabhi maamalon kii nigaraanee ke liye ucchtam nyaayalay ke kisi avkashprapt nyaayadhish kii niyukti kii jaye, lekin aapane iske liye ek alag tantra banaaya
 We want to see what is lacking in this system and how it has been working
 nyaayalay ne kaha, aapane apni ore se gathit samiti ke samaksh aarope patr ko prastut kiye bina hi ise daayar kar diya
 We are surprised
 peeth ne kaha, hamane chaar may ko is maamle kii sunwaayee kii thi lekin us din sthiti report main is baat kaa koi zikr nahin kiya gaya tha ki chah may ko aarope patr pesh kiya jayega
 You did not mention this in the status report
 aarope patr ke bare main koi zikr nahin kiya gaya tha
 The top court asked, why it was not mentioned that the charge sheet would be presented
 peeth ne yah bhi poocha, is baat kaa ullekh kyon nahin kiya gaya tha ki jaanch kaa kaam puraa ho gaya tha or aaropapatr daayar kiya jaayegaa
 Two days later, we read in the newspaper that the charge sheet was filed
 ucchtam nyaayalay ne kaha ki chaar may ko pesh sthiti report main kaha gaya tha ki jaanch kaa kaary abhi bhi jari he
 The bench said it is surprising that the charge sheet was not placed before the 10-member committee headed by the revenue secretary
 peeth ne kaha, ham samajhate the ki kisi ko aaropapatr ko dekhnaa chahie
 It should have been placed before a committee constituted by the government
 peeth ne kaha ki prashn jaanch kii nigaraanee se judaa hua he jiske liye sarkaar kii ore se vishesh jaanch dal ke gathan kaa virodh karte hue ek tantra sthapit kiya gaya tha
 The apex court bench told Solicitor General Gopal Subramaniam, "we are surprised that you suggested a mechanism and set up a mechanism for monitoring
" 
 Subramaniam agreed that the charge sheet should have been placed before the committee
 unhone kaha ki sudharatmak upaae kiye jaaenge
 The court directed the Enforcement Directorate to give a copy of the 900-page charge sheet to the petitioners

 yah aankada ek lakh karod rupee se zyada dur nahin he
 According to the report, during the period April to December 2010, when crude oil prices were running at an average of $ 80 per barrel, then the lower recovery of oil companies was estimated to be Rs 47,000 crore
 baharhaal, chauthi timahi main kachche tel ke daam ausatan 101 dollar prati bairal ke str par bane hue hai

 Should India invest in social sector infrastructure to boost production capacity and consequently economic growth? Or should it focus only on economic growth in order to get the necessary resources for social sector schemes?
