 The complainant is getting the demand for the outstanding amount
 In his complaint, the complainant said that he is receiving threats to kill him for demanding the outstanding 16 lakh rupees

 company ne ise duniya kaa sabase sasta mobile phone bataaya tha
 Rigging bells have been surrounded earlier, the company made a lot of headlines in controversies by linking this scheme to the Digital India program of the Government of India

 In fact, in November, the company claimed to deliver 2 lakh phones worth Rs 251

 According to the statistics, only 70 thousand mobiles have been delivered so far

 The police have not yet found any clue of that car
 itibipi main tainaat aiji anand swaroop ne is maamle main abhi tak chuppi saadh rakhi he
 Who is Anand Swaroop Anand Srupp is a 1992 batch IPS officer
 upi cader ke ipies anand swaroop mul rup se bihar ke rahane vaale hai
 Anand is considered a fast-moving IPS officer
 ve apane kaam main raajnneetik dakhal pasand nahin karte
 This is the reason why they have been transferred frequently
 abhi kuch maah pehle hi ve pratiniyukti par itibipi main bataur aiji musuri (uttarakhand) main tainaat kiye gaye the
 But he was soon transferred to the ITBP headquarters
 noida ke sector 23 main unka nijee nivas he

 On 20 January, his blue lighted Tata Safari car registration number CH01-GA-2915 was parked outside his house
 jo aadhi raat ke baad chori ho gai thi
 Police say the theft took place after 3 pm
 safari car vahaan se jate vakt ek CCTV camere main kaid ho gai thi
 What happened was the action of the robbery at the house of an IPS officer
 lihaaja noida police ne turant aiji anand swaroop kii shikaayat par maamla darj kar liya
 Several teams of police have been formed to search the car
 kai raaston par lage sisitivi camaron kii footage bhi khangaali gai he
 But about 27 days after the car was stolen, the police are still empty
 dipti espi anup yadav ke mutabik police ko kuch jaankaree mili he lekin abhi pukhtataur par kuch kaha nahin ja saktaa
 Car is being searched
 police jaanch kii disha dilli kii taraf he
 IG Anand Swaroop has kept silence ever since Anand Swaroop had stolen a car from outside the Sadhupi Ghar
 ve is bare main media se koi baat nahin kar rahe hai
 Aaj Tak contacted him on the phone and tried to talk in this regard but there was no response from his side
 unki chuppi ko lekar bhi kai sawaal khadey ho rahe hai
 The police had issued the alert just before January 26, due to the theft of IG Anand Swaroop's car, the problem of the police increased
 is sambandh main police ne ek alert bhi jari kiya tha
 So that the surrounding states can also be alerted about the car
 lekin baavjood alert ke abhi tak car kii koi khabar nahin he
 Many questions arose after the car theft, even before the Pathankot attack, the blue lighted car terror of SP of Gurdaspur was robbed
 jiskaa istemaal unhone police kii najaron se bachane ke liye kiya tha
 Similarly, the theft of ig's car under suspicious circumstances raises many questions in itself
 masalan, sector 23 kii jis getband colony main aiji anand swaroop kaa ghar he, vahaan koi aam chor car churaane kii himmat kaise kar saktaa he
 While a blue light was also placed on the safari car
 get par 24 ghante guard maujuud rahete hai
 If the car was brand new, it could not have any key in it without duplication
 agar raat main 3 baje koi ajanabi colony main andar aayaa tha to guard ne use kaise jane diya or agar jane diya to uski entry bhi kii hogi
 Or if the thief was already inside then why did the guard not see who was driving the car while going outside the car
 jaahir raat main sabhi coloniyon ke get band rahete hai
 If the CCTV camera footage shows the car going away but not the car driver, it means that the robber was already careful
 vah camere kii najar se bachaa rahaa
 It seems that the thief was either aware of the colony or he had come to Reiki many times
 police ke mutabik usee din car kisi takneekee khami ke chalate okhla main sarvice centre bhi gai thi
 Did the police question the staff there
 agar vahaan se car chori ke taar jude hai to police ne abhi tak is maamle main safataur par kuch kyon nahin kaha
 At the moment, the silence of the police and IG Anand Swaroop has made the case more complicated
 jab tak maamle kaa khulaasa nahin ho jaataa yaa car nahin mil jaati tab tak police ke liye yah maamla ek bada sirdard bana rahegaa

 China has admitted that the terrorist attack on Mumbai is one of the 'most notorious' attacks in the world

 aapako bataa den ki china ne yah patr aise samay main nikaala he jabpakistan ke videsh mantri shah mahmud kuraishi china kii yatra par aae hue hai

 Let us tell you that on 26 November 2008 in Mumbai, a fierce attack was carried out by 10 armed lashkar-e-taiba terrorists
 isamen america nagarikon sahit 166 logon kii jaan gayi thi or 300 se adhik log ghayal ho gayi the

 This proposal of the budget is an indication that Prime Minister Narendra Modi may be entangling on the domestic front, but his preparations for global ambitions are round about
 nijee nivesh kii peeth par videsh niti ko bithaana or is makasad se ek saarvajanik company kaa gathan, darasal kootneeti kaa pipipi (public privet partnership) model he, jo bhartiya antarrashtriya sambandhon ko nayaa aayam de saktaa he
 This new course of diplomacy has become quite important in light of the Prime Minister's recent visit to the island states of the Indian Ocean
 bharat kii kootnithik ranneeti kaa nayaa swaroop modi ke taaja global abhiyaanon kii naseehaton se niklaa he
 The Prime Minister is beginning to realize the boundaries of emotional Indianness and affiliation with the Indian diaspora
 global suraksha or ekajutata ke ranneetik vimarsh bade deshon ko jod sakate hai lekin chote deshon se rishton main mahashaktiyon se sambandhon jaisi bhavyata nahin bhari ja sakati
 They have to stay on the ground of solid economic transactions, which India does not have a strong model
 modi videsh niti main bade or chote deshon se rishton kaa alag-alag praaroop tay karnaa chaahate hai taaki global mahatvakankshaon ko samgr rup se saadhaa ja sake
 The results of their first dialogue with small countries like Seychelles, Mauritius and Sri Lanka will be very important for this strategy
 global bisaat par prashanth va atlantic mahasagariya kshetron ke dabadabe ke kaaran hind mahaasaagar, na keval charchaaon se lagbhag baahar he balki yah kshetra pichley 25 varsh main niskriy kootnithik prayogon kaa ajaayabaghar bhi ban gaya he

 In 1997, it took 17 years for Thailand's seven-nation-led biquetsch-ec (bay of Bengal Initiative for multi-sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation) to become a secretariat
 2000 main bana mekong ganga kooparation bhi 15 saal main kuch bayanon se aage nahin badha
 The Indian Ocean Rim Association (1995), with a membership of 20 countries including Australia, India, South Africa and Iran, was the most ambitious campaign in the region but also where it stands
 narendra modi jab is kshetra main nai shuruyaat kar rahe hai to unki peeth par in bade kootnithik prayogon kii asafalataa bhi ladi he
 These failures do not shine in India's account only because it is the largest country along the Indian Ocean but also because India does not have any concrete form of relations with small countries in the Indian Ocean and the rest of the world
 bhartiya kootneeti in chote deshon se rishton main chaatro ko wajife, paryaton or line of credit se aage nahin bad pai
 Exploitation of cultural relations also comes to a degree
 chote mulkon ke liye dosti kaa matlab unki tarakkee main sidhi bhagidaari he
 This was the reason why China's diplomacy proceeded on the back of investment
 china ne videshi mudra bhandar va bhimkaay sarkari companiyon ke jariye hind mahaasaagar se lekar africa va europe tak kai chote deshon ke aarthik hiton ko sidhe taur par prabhavit kiya he
 India does not have the strength of foreign exchange reserves through which to invest in small countries
 sarkarein kaarobaar main simit hissaa rakhti hai, isliye hind mahaasaagar kshetra main sarkaron ke bich sahyog kii koshishen bahut paravaan nahin chadhin
 This is the reason why Modi is facing India's private companies for his diplomatic success
 hind mahaasaagar kii yatra se pehle purvi asia main nivesh kaa rasta banane vaali nai company kaa elaan yah bataane kii koshish he ki china ne chote mulkon main jo kaam apni vishaal sarkari companiyon ke jariye kiya, bharat use nijee companiyon ke saath karnaa chahta he
 Narendra Modi must have mentioned this new initiative in the meetings of Seychelles, Mauritius and Sri Lanka, as a team of captains of Indian industry reached Colombo before the Prime Minister reached Sri Lanka
 haal ke varshon main kisi chote desh main bhartiya companiyon ke adhikariyon kaa yah sabase bada jamaavada tha
 This experiment of linking private investment with diplomacy will not be limited to East Asia alone
 modi yahi prayog hind mahaasaagar ke liye karenge or unki africa yatra main bhi aisi koshish najar aegi
 Private companies of India and Indian diaspora abroad are seen to be the basis of Modi's global campaign
 chunauti yah he ki bharat kii nijee companiyaan global paimaane par bahut choti hai
 He needs global credibility, strength, transparency and a greater size to help Modi's diplomatic plans, so that business risks can be taken from Laos, Cambodia to Mauritius and Seychelles
 duusari taraf anivaasee bhartiya keval chamakate bharat ko or chamakaa sakate hai, videsh main based samrudh chiniyon jaisaa nivesh nahin kar sakate
 Whatever emotional call the Prime Minister may make from foreign forums, but after his visit to the Indian Ocean, he will also realize the reality that his global ambitions need the foundation of good governance and fast growth in India
 iske bina na nijee companiyaan sakriy hongi or na unke mureed bharatvanshi sakriy rah paaenge
 There was a lot of address to India from foreign forum, now Modi has to address abroad from the land of the country

 Rishabh Pant was questioned on Mahendra Singh Dhoni's successor, Rishabh Pant was questioned by former India opener Gautam Gambhir in the third T20 match against South Africa
 jiske baad ek baar phir mahendra singh dhoni ke uttaradhikari maane ja rahe rishabh pant par sawaal khadey ho gaye hai
 Pant has been playing as the team's chief wicketkeeper since Mahendra Singh Dhoni's international break, but has been steadily failing
 rishabh pant ravivaar ko south africa ke khilaaf bengalooru main khele gaye tisare tii-20 match main 19 ran banaakar out ho gaye
 Earlier in the second T20 match played in Mohali on Wednesday, Pant landed at number 4 to bat and was dismissed for just 4 runs
 rishabh pant kii cricket ke teenon formet main lagaataar naakaami ke baad chif selector emesake prasad ne bhi unhen ishaaron hi ishaaron main warning de di thi
 Chief Selector of BCCI Selection Committee M
 es
 K
 prasad ne kaha tha ki vah rishabh pant ke vikalp ke taur par ishan kishan, sanju samson or anya wicketciparon par nigahen rakhe hue hai
 Earlier, head coach Ravi Shastri had already made it clear about Rishabh Pant that this wicket-keeper batsman could not repeat his mistakes continuously and would have to bear the brunt if he did so
 team india ke mukhya coach ravi shastri ne bhi kaha tha ki rishabh pant agar westeindies daure ke dauraan kii gayi galatiyon ko doharaate rahenge, to unhen iskaa khamiyaja bhugatna padegaa
 
 
 
 jab bengaluru main number-4 par utarane ke liye ek saath uth khadey hue pant or ayyarlekin rishabh pant ko bhartiya team ke purv openar gautam gambhir kaa saath mila he
 Gautam Gambhir has strongly criticized the team management's remarks about Rishabh Pant
 gautam gambhir ne kaha he ki yah dekhnaa niraashajanak or hataash karne vaala rahaa ki team management rishabh pant ke liye fireles se kereles jaise shabdon kaa istemaal kar rahaa he
 i can see, Rishabh Pant is seen playing to secure his place instead of scoring runs
 gautam gambhir ne times of india main likhe ek lekh main kaha ki kisi yuva ballebaaj ko sanbhaalane kaa yah tarika sahi nahin he
 The team management is giving Rishabh Pant a chance at number four in a row, but Pant has not yet proved to be a regular performer on this line
 captain viraat kohli ne bhi kaha tha ki yuvaaon ko 4-5 maukon kaa laabh uthaakar hi khud ko sabit karnaa hoga
 While batting coach Vikram Rathore also questioned Pant's attitude

 While correcting this mistake, a slight smile appeared on Hillary's face
 haalanki hillari ne baad main apni baat puri karte hue kaha ki 'hamen ek aisi arthvyavastha banane kii jarurat he jis par har america ko garv ho, jo arthvyavastha sabake liye ho na ki sirf amiron ke liye

 badi mahant mahant divyagiri, 41 varsh mankameshwar mandir, lakhanuubhagava vastra, baalo ko lapetakar gutha juda, sir tathaa gardan ke hisson ko dhankta bhagava safa or gale main rudraksh kii lambii maala
 The image of Mahant Divyagiri is now completely different from the young student of pathology in Barabanki
 ve lakhanu ke mankameshwar mandir main darshan ko ain to phir vahiin kii hokar rah gayi or mukhya pujari kaa asana paa gayi
 Earlier he was known as Arunima Singh
 tab vah medhaavi chaatra barahavin paas karne ke baad pathology kii padhai kii khwaahish rakhti thi lekin mata-pita ucch shiksha ke liye barabanki se baahar bhejne ko raji na the
 He finally relented and in 1998 Arunima reached Delhi to pursue a diploma in pathology
 bhagwaan main aasthaa ke baavjood arunima mandiron main niyamit nahin jaaya karti thi
 After doing a diploma, she wanted to open her own pathology laboratory
 so, peth lab kaa kamdhaam dekhne ke liye unhone lakhanu kii labs kaa daura karnaa shuru kar diya
 One day in 2000, a family friend and a disciple of Keshavdas Maharaj, the then Mahant of Mankameshwara Temple, took Arunima to the nearly 1,000-year-old Shiva temple on the banks of Gomti
 arunima dobaaraa is mandir main akele ain
 She sat in meditation in front of Shivling and suddenly had a divine feeling
 ve kahati hai, "achaanak mere liye sab kuch badal gaya
 i no longer had the desire to open a pathology lab
 main ab bas is mandir main hi rahanaa chaahati thi
 "arunima came home and told the parents about her decision
 shuruaati naa-nukur ke baad ve raji ho gaye
 The real challenge for Arunima started now: the Mankameshwar Peeth did not allow any woman to be a disciple
 ve bataati hai, "keshav das maharajaji teen maheene tak apane rukh par ade rahe lekin main har subah jaati or anurodh karti
 In January 2001, Arunima was finally renounced in the presence of five saints
 unhen nayaa naam milaah divyagiri
 The matter did not stop here 2008 main biimaar mahant keshavadas ne apane uttaradhikari ke rup main divyagiri kaa naam prastaavit kiya
 Most of the 57 office bearers of the temple management trust, Panch Dashanam Juna Akhada, opposed the idea of a woman occupying the seat on which the men had been sitting for five generations
 lekin shri kaashi sumeru peeth ke shankaracharya swami narendra saraswati ne unka samarthan kiya
 On August 24, 2008, Divyagiri took over as the mahant of the temple
 ve kahati hai, "striyaan jeevat hoti hai
 They can achieve anything on the strength of dedication
 '' The government has also made arrangements to withdraw cash in big-markets and petrol pumps to provide relief to people from demonetisation and cashless atms
 lekin sarkaar kii is skim par ab khatra mandara rahaa he
 As of now, Big Bazaar and petrol pumps are giving cash of their own circulation under the swipe machine scheme but the lack of new notes can flop this scheme
 shanivaar ko jab bank band hue oretiemcashles bane to big bazaar ke cash counter ne bhi logon ko dagaa de diya
 Even withdrawing money by swiping the card from petrol pump has become impossible now
 noida ke jiipi mal ke big bazaar ke outlet par cash nikaalane ke liye baqayda board laga he
 On which it is clearly written that cash can be withdrawn in three ways and for this, put your debit card number in the swapping machine and the person sitting at the cash counter will catch you two thousand rupees
 lekinbig bazarse cash nikaalane main takneekee khamiyaan thim jisane jald cash nikaalane kaa khwab lekar big-bazaar pahunche logon ko lanbaa intjaar karvaa diya
 Actually, due to the server down of SBI machine, people who had come to gip's Big Bazaar outlet in the morning to withdraw cash, had to wait for about 2 hours
 iske baavjood log big bazaar cash policy se kaaphi khush hai kyonki yahaan inhen air-condishan facility kaa bhi istemaal karne kaa mauka mil rahaa he
 Although the system of cash from the swapping machine has been applied to the petrol pump as well, but the swapping machine is not seen at the petrol pump yet
 haalanki petrol panpon ke maalikon kaa yah kahana he ki bainkon ne sweaping mashin kaa intjaam to kar diya he lekin cash naa uplabdh karaae jane kii vajah se wo logon ko abhi ye suvidha nahin de paa rahe hai
 According to Ajay Bansal, president of All India Petroleum Dealers Association, till now the petrol pump was giving cash through swapping machines to people but now it is difficult for the petrol pump to make available the cash
 darasal petrol pump par teen bade bainkon ne sweaping mashin se cash uplabdh karwaane kaa vaada kiya tha
 But so far only one bank is providing cash and that too only one lakh rupees
 jo in petrol panpon par oont ke munh main jire ke baraabar hi sabit ho rahaa he
 Not only this, because of taking an old currency of 500 rupees at the petrol pump, the new currency is not reaching the pump
 isiilie swip mashin ke jariye card swip hone ke baad bhi logon ko nai karansi dena lagbhag petrol pump ke liye naammumkin ho gaya he

 In this we have said that Baba Abhiram Das was a priest in Ram Janmabhoomi since 1949
 unke naam se exiaar hua
 All the Muslim parties after the FIR made Baba Abhiram Das a party
 hamane koi mukadmaa nahin kiya tha
 These people sued us
 pujari banane kaa daawa chaunkaane walaunhone aage kaha ki ham pujari ke liye musalamaanon se lekar nirmohi akhaada ke bhaskar das ne apane bayaan main kaha tha ki baba abhiram das pujari the
 After that Devkinandan Aggarwal said in his case that Baba Abhiram Das was the chief priest of the month, then the whole system was in our favor
 court ne mana isiilie maine aavedan dekar kaha ki trust main or ram janmabhumi main pujari kii vyavastha karen
 The responsibility should be given to protect Indian culture and sage society and serve Lord Rama
 pujari banane ke liye maine aavedan diya he jo bhi test banegaa dekha jayega baat kii jaaegi
 Meanwhile another interesting case has come up
 maujuuda samay menram mandirke pujari acharya satyendra das hai jo mahant dharmadas ke bade guru bhai he yani acharya satyendra das or mahant dharmadas ek hi guru baba abhiram das ke shishy hai
 Now, in such a situation, Satyendra Das, the chief priest of Ram Janmabhoomi is taken aback by his Guru Bhai's claim of becoming a priest, but he says in a very strict manner that he has been worshiping Ramlala for 27 years, who first worshiped
 His own Guru Baba Abhiram Das had started, so he is following the tradition of his Guru and he was selected on this basis
 ho saktaa he unke guru bhai usee parampara ko aage badhaane kii baat kar rahe ho, lekin unako yah maang kerani chahie kii jab bade guru bhai pujari hai to chote guru bhai kii koi jarurat nahin he
 Staff of Priest Satyendra Das Commissioner: Triloki Nath Pandey and Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas member Triloki Nath Pandey have also been entrusted with the rivalry between two Guru brothers to become priests
 unhone sidhe taur par vartmaan pujari satyendra das ko kamishnar kaa emplai (karmchaaree) qaraar de diya or kaha ki vah to emplai hai jinhen vetan miltaa he pujari to trust banayega jabaki mahant dharmadas hai court tak chale mukademe ke dauraan unke mitra hua karte the lekin ab kinhin logon ke bahekaave main hai or vah nahin jaanate ki koun unako guide kar rahaa he
 There is another twist in the controversy of becoming a priest and this new twist has been created by Triloki Nath Pandey, a party of Ramlala Virajaman Paksha and a member of Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas
 jab baat ramalala ke pujari banane kii ai to inhone bhi apni dabi ichha kaa izhaar karte hue kah diya ki aakhir unke andar koun si kami he ki vah pujari nahin ho sakate
 He also has a claim and even if someone does not accept his claim, he still has a desire to become a priest of Ramlala
 triloki nath pandey ne kaha, 'pujari chunane kii prakriya trust ke sadsy milakar karenge
 First the trust came out
 ramalala kii bhavy or divya vyavastha hogi
 The offering of raga which is done by Vaishno method will be performed by the same tradition
 pujari trust niyukt karegaa
 Every person has the right to claim to be a priest
 main bhi daawa karata hum ki main hi uskaa pujari banuun
 What is lacking in me that i cannot become a priest
 yah daawa nahin lekin meri ichha jarur he
 On the whole episode, the spokesperson of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, Sharad Sharma also did not delay in showing the mirror to the current priest of the Ram temple, Satyendra Das, and his own companions, who were targeting the Dharmadas
 ramanand sampradaay kaa ho pujariah vhpviecapi ke pravaktaa sharad sharma ne kaha ki maujuuda pujari to kamishnar ke dwaara niyukt karmchaaree hai or apane kaary kaa unhen vetan miltaa he
 The priest of the Ram temple must be a master of all virtues, a celibate observant of Vedic customs and a person of the Ramananda sect
 usee tarj par jaisaa mata vaishno devi or balaji tirupati main hota he usee vidhi vidhaan se puja honi chahie
 The Nirmohi Akhara was fighting the case of Ram temple only to demand the right to worship worship in the Ram temple, whereas now the Supreme Court has also ordered the Nirmohi Akhara to participate in the trust to be constituted as a partner in the management of the Ram temple
 nirmohi akhaade ne panchon kii baithak karke pradhanmantri modi ko apana daayitv nishchit karne ke liye milane kaa samay maanga he
 In such a situation it will be interesting to see how far the race to become the priest of the Ram temple goes and what color does this series of debates show later
 sonia gandhi ne sweekaar kiya ki is chunaav ko lekar "kaaphi tanaav" tha,or kaha, "main khush hum,or unki (ahamed patel kii) jeet se raahat mili he

 After hearing the news of this murder, DSP Zia ul Haq reached the spot with three policemen and took the injured Pradhan aspataal pahunche jahaan doctoron ne unhen mrit ghoshit kar diya
 After this he returned to the village with the body of the headman
 is samay tak unke paas kareeb aath police vaale aa gaye the
 But by the time he returned, an angry mob of about 300 people had gathered in the village
 kaha ja rahaa he ki is bheed main kuch log hathiyaar se las the
 Seeing the crowd uncontrollable, the policemen accompanying the DSP right away slowly reached hiding places
 unka kahana he ki haq ko logon ne alag kar liya
 And took him to the back of Pradhan's house
 iske baad teen goliyon kii aawaaj sunai di
 Police say that two of the three bullets were fired on Pradhan's brother Suresh Yadav
 vahiin se paanch meter kii duuri par dspi haq ko buree tarah se peeta gaya

 Complaints are being received about non-compliance of the government directive related to breakfast and catering for children in schools
 kai skulon main chaanbin ke baad pataa chalaa he ki bacchon ko subah kaa naashtaa naseeb nahin ho paa rahaa kyonki skool sarkari nirdeshon ko darkinar kar rahe hai
 Far from the far-flung areas of the country, many complaints have also surfaced in the capital Delhi
 dilli hai court ne bhi iskaa sangyaan liya he
 Shortly before the court got the government schools inspected in Delhi, which showed very shocking and sad results
 inspection main paaya gaya ki dilli ke sarkari skulon or nagar nigam main padhane vaale kareeb 40 fisadi bacchon ko subah naashtaa naseeb nahin hota he
 These 40 percent of children from poor families neither get anything to eat from home nor are they served breakfast after coming to school
 ek anumaan ke mutabik dilli ke sarkari skulon main kareeb 15 se 16 lakh bachche padhate hai, jabaki emsidi skulon main ye sankhya 8 lakh ke aasapaas he
 Out of these 24 lakh children, 12 lakh children come in the morning shift and none of them get the morning breakfast from school
 jabaki unamem main 40 fisadi yani kareeb 5 lakh bacchon ko ghar se bhi kuch na milane ke kaaran subah bhukhe hi padhai karne ko majaboor hona padataa he
 The National Food Security Act, made in 2013, clearly states that children should be given snacks in the morning before mid-day meal
 yah niyam isliye bana kyonki sansad ko bhi andaja tha ki sarkari skulon main aane vaale bacchon ke pariwaron kii aarthik sthiti kharaab hoti he jiske chalate kaaphi sankhya main bachche naashtaa lekar nahin aa pate
 According to the information that is coming out now, neither the Delhi government nor the MCD school is being served breakfast in the schools, defying the provisions of the Food Security Act
 yah sthiti isliye badtar maani ja rahi he kyonki dilli sarkaar shiksha ke kshetra main kaaphi kaamkaaj kiye jane or aadharbhoot str par sudhaar kiye jane kaa daawa karti he
 Delhi Education Minister Manish Sisodia can often be seen asserting this claim, but the truth is telling something else
 jab subah ke naashte main skulon main itani badi kotahi kii khabaren saamne aa rahi hai to bhojan kii kya dasha hogi, samajhnaa aasaan he
 The Delhi High Court has taken serious note of the matter and will also hear it in April

 uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ab ek nae vivaad main ghirte dikh rahe hai
 The latest controversy has arisen regarding his birthday
 darasal, akhilesh sarkaar main mantri tej narayan pandeya ne akhilesh yadav ke janmdin ko lekar anushthan karavaaya he
 By the way, in the government documents, his date of birth is recorded on 1 July 1973
 magar unke mantrimandal main manoranjan kar rajyamantri or khud ko akhilesh yadav kaa dost bataane vaale tej narayan pandeya kii maane, to siem kii vaastavik janmatithi 24, oktober 1973 he
 Perhaps this is the reason why rituals were conducted in Ayodhya in the presence of religious leaders and Muslim ulema
 vivaad ko janm dene vaale mantri ne kaaryakartaaon or dharmaguruon kii maujuudagi main akhilesh kii tasviir ko haar pahanaakar or maathe par tilak lagaakar unke dderghaayu kii kaamana kii
 According to the Dharmacharyas, this minister told them about the Chief Minister's birthday and asked them to perform the rituals
 yahaan tak ki faijabad ke party karyaalay main 24 oktober ko 40 kilo kaa kek kataa gaya or 'janmdin mubarak' or 'jindabad' ke naare lagaae gaye
 The question arises that if 24 October is the birthday of Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, then how is it recorded on 1 July? If 1 July is a real birthday, is 24 October merely a political birthday of CM? Whatever be the reality, but the ritual conducted by Akhilesh's minister has raised questions

 a new controversy has taken birth on Thursday after the ongoing protest against the increase in fees and new hostel rules at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU)
 ye nayaa maamla swami vivekanand kii murti ke saath chhedchhad kaa he
 The Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) has alleged that an attempt has been made to damage the statue of non-unveiled Vivekananda in JNU
 bataa den ki is murti ke aasapaas bijepi ko lekar kai slogan likhe the, haalanki prashasan ne ise saaf kara diya he
 ABVP said that damage to public property shows mental insolvency of left student organizations
 ABVP jeenyu main ikai adhyaksh durgesh kumaar ne kaha ki akhil bhartiya vidhyaarthee parishad ne pehle hi is ore ishaara kiya tha ki isa, esefai, dsef, esef jaise vampanthi chaatr sanghathanon se jude kaaryakarta jeenyu andolan kii aad main apane tuchh raajnneetik hiton ko anaavashyak tool de rahe hai, jiskaa vishvavidhyalay se matlab nahin he
 State Minister of Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad Siddharth Yadav said that Swami Vivekananda has made a very important contribution in showing the direction to modern India, he cannot be seen sitting in an ideological slot
 lekin jis prakaar se left ke logon ne unke stachu ko kshatigrast karne kaa prayaas kiya, vah behad durbhagyapurna he
 We will fight to eliminate such indigenous ideas from all the campuses in India
 ham prashasan se maang karte hai ki jo swami vivekanand kii pratimaa ko kshatigrast karne ke prayaas main sanlipt hon, unke khilaaf kadi karrwai kii jaae
 In a joint statement, ABVP JNU unit president Durgesh Kumar and secretary Manish Jangid said that while the common student of JNU is fighting for his rights, the Left is trying unsuccessfully to revive its flopped agenda
 jis prakaar se puure vishvavidhyalay ko ganda kiya gaya or saarvajanik sampatti ko nuksaan pahunchaaya gaya kya vah sahi he? kya vishvavidhyalay kii saarvajanik sampatti ko surakshit karnaa ham sabhi chaatro kaa daayitv nahin he? yah krity andolan ko galat disha main le jane vaala he, jo ki ham safal nahin hone denge
 Our fight is to get the hostel manual back, under the guise of the Left's attempt to impose its extreme views, the common student will never succeed
 abivipi kar rahi andolan kaa galat istemaal, sajeesh he ye: jeenyu chaatrasanghajeenyu chaatr sangh ne is bare main apana bayaan jari karte hue kaha he ki shulk vruddhi ke khilaaf hamaara andolan bina student kii paraamarsh ke ek hostel minial kaa masauda prashasnic kaamkaaj ke adhinayakawadi tareekon ke khilaaf ek loktantric andolan he
 Students who risk their future due to fee hike can never be guilty of any violence or undemocratic action
 ham jeenyu chaatr andolan kii aad main aisi galat koshishon kii ninda karte hai
 The JNU student community does not support any wrongdoing done in its name
 aisa jo bhi karata he vah apane naam se kar rahaa he or is tarah ke krityon ko sahi tehraane ke liye andolan ke naam kaa istemaal nahin karnaa chahie
 Such an act is a conspiracy to discredit the university
 ye dakshinpanthi soch vaale logon kaa kaam he
 The VC, the ruling regime and the people of ABVP present on campus want to turn the issue of fee hike into a futile and polarizing debate
 fees vruddhi kaa tathakthith role back ek kalpana he
 The service and utility charges which were earlier zero have also been added
 bipiel chaatro ko raahat dene kii nautanki bhi jhooth he kyonki ve fees vruddhi kaa upyog karne ja rahe hai
 JNUSU said that thus the attempt to divert us from the real issues will not succeed

 But if someone says that this election is for the Legislative Assembly and not for the Parliament, then EVM can be expanded to be Every Vote for Manohar
 
 
 or is baat se koi fark nahin padataa ki vot modi ji ke liye he yaa manohar ke liye, jo nishaan dabaaya janaa he, vah 'camel' he

 Our aim was to somehow declare Masood Azhar a global terrorist, in which we were successful

 Foreign Ministry spokesman Ravish Kumar said, "we welcome China's move to remove the bottleneck

 Accusing the Congress of 'attempting to hide in the bunker of secularism', Narendra Modi today said that the party is fighting for its survival
 unhone kaha ki nai loksabhaa main congress ke liye 100 seat ke str tak pahunchnaa bhi 'kathin kaary' prathit ho rahaa he
 Reacting sharply to Congress President Sonia Gandhi's allegation that her election campaign was a "dangerous nexus of religious bigotry, money and force", the BJP prime ministerial candidate said, "she (congress) is facing a certain defeat in her existence
" Is fighting a battle and once again attempting to hide in the bunker of secularism
 ' Modi said, 'his ultimate hope is to somehow cross the 100-seat level, which seems to be a difficult task for him
 ' sonia ke kataaksh ki vah bharat ko swarg banane kaa vaada kar rahe hai, par pratikriya vyakt karte hue unhone kaha, 'maine kabhi yah nahin kaha ki main bharat ko swarg bana duungaa or mere paas sabhi samasyaon kaa hal he
 i am convinced that people also do not expect this from me
 ' Modi said that the people of India are also not expecting miracles but 'they are definitely entitled to get a stable, decisive and sensitive government
 ' On the other hand, when asked about the allegation made by Priyanka Gandhi on Modi accusing her family and her husband Robert Vadra, she said that like a daughter and a sister, she has the right to campaign for her mother and brother
 
 modi ne kaha, 'yah swaabhaavik he ki ek putree apni maa kaa bachaav karnaa pasand karegi
 a sister would like to defend her brother
 mujhe use lekar koi dikkat nahin he
 Asked how the allegations against Vadra will be dealt with when he comes to power, the BJP leader said that he does not believe in the politics of revenge and falling behind someone whom he himself has been a 'victim' for ten years
 
 unhone saath hi yah bhi kaha ki koi bhi kanoon se upar nahin he or agar kisi ne kuch galat kiya he to kanoon apana kaam karegaa
 'but it should be institutionalized through regular process in which there is no interference from any class

 So the BJP leader replied, 'so far i am very confident that the BJP along with its existing alliance partners is going to get the necessary numbers to form the government at the Center
 aapako yah yaad rakhana chahie ki hamaare paas abhi 25 se zyada saajhedaaron kaa ek bada shaktishaalee gathbandhan he
 ' modi ne kaha, 'hamen yakeen he ki ham sarkaar chalaane kaa sankhyabal hasil kar lenge
 However, we need everyone's support and cooperation to run the country
 ' The BJP leader took a scathing attack on the Congress for the OBC quota for backward Muslims, and said it was indeed a 'last attempt' to do 'vote bank politics and appeasement politics before elections'
 modi ne kaha ki congress aisa vaada yah jaanate hue bhi kar rahi he ki use lagu nahin kiya ja saktaa
 He said, 'I will also say that this exposes the real' secular 'face of the party which intends to get votes on the basis of religion

 Prior to the four-match Test series against Australia (india vs Australia), everyone had speculated that the Mitchell Starc-led fast bowler trio could take the tough test of Indian batting
 yah anumaan lagaae jane ke peeche paryaapt kaaran bhi the
 Australia have an excellent trio of fast bowlers in the form of Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood and Pat Cummins and it has always proved difficult for Indian batsmen to face the fast bowlers (outside Asia) on overseas grounds due to rich bounce and movement
 
 haalanki yah anumaan puri tarah galat sabit hua or ab tak ke donon test maichon main bhartiya ballebaajon ke liye of spinner natham leone (nathan Lyon) pareshaani kaa kaaran bane hai
 Australia won 1–1 in the series, winning the second Test in Perth and Leon proved to be a big difference between the two teams in this victory
 edilade ovel main hue pehle test main bhi nathan leone ne shandaar pradarshan kiya tha
 The Indian team won the Test by 31 runs to take a 1-0 lead in the series but Australia equalized the matter by winning in Perth
 saurav ganguli bole, bharat ke paas australia ko haraane kaa mauka lekin saath main di yah chetavanee
 
 
 Former captain of the Indian team Sourav Ganguly believes that the Indian batsmen are showing excessive respect for the bowling of Nathan Lyon and this gives the spinner a chance to dominate
 india tivi ke saath baatcheet ke dauraan ganguli ne kaha ki bhartiya ballebaajon ko leone ke khilaaf akraman kii niti apnaani chahie
 He said that India's batsmen showed great respect for Leon and also played defensively the balls outside his off-stump
 saurav (sourav Ganguly) ne kaha, 'maine viraat kohli ko ek text massej bhejne ke bare main sochaa tha haalanki maine abhi is bheja nahin he
 i wanted to tell Kohli that his batsmen should not give more wickets to spinners outside Asia
 ' haalanki saurav ne sweekaar kiya ki leone (nathan Lyon) mahaan spinner hai lekin unhone kaha ki shen worne, muthaiya muralidharan or greem swaan bhi to bade spin gendbaaj the
 According to Ganguly, Indian batsmen are showing more respect to the spinner by defending the balls outside Leon's off stump
 unhone kaha, 'meraa maananaa he ki ballebaajon ko unke khilaaf adhik aakraamak hona chahie
 Indian batsmen should focus on scoring more than 300 or 350 runs
 ' leone ne ab tak ke donon test maichon main 8-8 wicket hasil kiye hai
 He also did well in batting in the Adelaide Test

 sanjay lila bhansaali kii filmon kaa yah shaashvat formula he
 'bajirao Mastani' is also the sequel to the Sanjay Leela Bhansali type films
 jisamen deepika, prinyaka or ranvir kaa prem trikon he
 Larger than life sets
 mantrmugdh karne vaale maukey hai, or dher saare kaanch kaa istemaal he jo film main chakachaundh le aata he
 He has chosen this time the story of Mastani, the daughter of Maratha Peshwa Bajirao and Raja Chhatrasal of Bundelkhand who is a Marathi writer N
 es
 Inamdar's book is based on 'rau'
 haalanki film aitihaasikta or prem kahani ke bich jhulati najar aati he
 But there is no denying that it is clearly seen in the film that when Ishq goes through the limits, it becomes a passion, and Deepika has lived it well on screen
 kahani kii batbajirao peshwa yani ranvir singh yudhkala se lekar shaastra kala sab main paarangat he
 Her beautiful and loving wife is Kashi Bai i
e
 Priyanka Chopra
 ek abhiyaan ke liye mastaani yanidipika padukonbajirao se madad maangati he, or apni bahaduree kaa parichay dete hue vah ranvir ke dil main jagah bana leti he
 But one day a mistake is made by Ranveer inadvertently, and Deepika accepts that mistake as true
 khud ko bajirao ke haathon haar baithti he
 On the other hand, this mistake has a direct effect on the Peshwa's wife Kashibai and the world of the wife who trusts her Bajirao is shaken
 is tarah ek prem kahani janm leti he, to ek patni ke astitv par sankat aa jaataa he
 In the midst of all this, if the question of religion arises, then things of political prestige and respect also emerge
 film kii kahani kai jagah par thodi khinchi hui lagati he, par mastaani is baat ko nazarandaaj karvaa detii he
 Star Appaldeepika has once again proved that if she does her work from the heart, she has the talent to die in the role
 unhone ishk kii jo deewangi dikhaai he, vah kamaal he
 Indeed, Mastani is very crazy in this film
 'bajirao mastaani' main sanjay lila bhansaali ne deepika ko jo style or luk diya he vah dil main gaharaai tak utarataa he
 Then the heroines of Sanjay's film know how to win hearts anyway
 deepika shandaar rahi hai, film main kahin-kahin to vah ranvir or baaki sab par baari bhi padati najar ain hai
 Ranveer Singh has also done a good job
 vah ek yoddha ke taur par achche lage hai
 He has done good action
 deepika ke saath bhi unki chemistry kamaal kii jami he
 He brings Marathi accents in Hindi at some point in the film, which is also tickling
 haalanki unhone is film ke liye bahut mehnat kii he, lekin ek-do baar aisa bhi hua he, jahaan vah peshwa na lagakar ranvir singh lage hai
 If there is love between Bajirao and Mastani, then Kashibai will have to suffer
 'bajirao mastaani' priyanka chopra kii yahi kahani he
 Priyanka has played her character well, but the entire film is about Ranveer and Deepika
 priyanka ke liye yah samay is tarah ke role karne kaa nahin he jisamen ve focus main na hon
 Tanvi Azmi has done a great job in the role of Bajirao's mother in the film
 mahesh manjrekar bhi thik hai or milind soman bajirao ke salaahkaar ke rup main saamaanya hai
 Talking about earnings, the contest for Sanjay Leela Bhansali's 'bajirao Mastani' is not easy at the box office, as 'dilwale' has also been released along with it
 sanjay lila bhansaali kaa apana ek audiyans he or phir ranvir singh or deepika padukon ke phans ke liye film puri tarah kasuti par khari utarati he
 Overall, 'bajirao Mastani' is an intense love story

 Let us tell you that due to this ban of America, countries like Turkey, Qatar, Saudi Arabia are not able to buy this missile system from Russia
 haalanki, iske baavjood bhi bharat or china is missile system ko rus se kharid rahe hai
 Firepower of this missile is 350 km
 tak he
 If sources are to be believed, talks have started between India and Russia on this
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki rus is deal ko china ke saath karne ko lekar aashwast nahin he
 Because it has been seen that China does reverse engineering, that is why Russia is doing so
 agar rus china ko ye system degaa bhi to kam kshamta vaala degaa
 The deal between India and Russia is still stuck with money
 kyonki rus jo daam maang rahaa he, vah kareeb 7 yues billian dollar ke kareeb he
 Significantly, if this missile system comes to India, India's strength in the Indian subcontinent will increase
 jis tarah se china lagaataar bharat ko gher rahaa he aise main bharat ke liye ye system kaaphi ahm sabit hoga
 Through this system, air strikes of up to 250 miles can be avoided, this system can eliminate 6 targets simultaneously

 Children are trapped in the cave in the middle of the water
 Let us know that the children are trapped in the Tham Luang cave of Chiang Rai province, it is very difficult to get there because the water is spread all around, the path is very narrow, there is darkness and there is mud The reason is that they have to struggle a lot to get out of there
 bharat ne bhi rajya sarkaar ko madad karne kii peshkash kii he
 Also, Aaj Tak's team is also present there, which is sending you news every second
 chiang raay ke governor narongs osothancorn ne guuruuvaar subah kaha, 'pehle hamaare saamne samay ko lekar chunauti thi lekin ab mausam chunauti bana hua he
 'chiang Rai region is expected to receive heavy rains soon which may increase the water level, increasing the risk for children in the Tham Luang cave complex
 chiang raay main beete kuch dinon main mausam shushk rahaa he
 Rescuers are considering how to get the group out safely
 narongs ke anusaar, agar barish ruk jaati he to sambhaavna he ki samooh tham luaang gupha parisar se baahar nikal saktaa he
 It takes 11 hours from the entrance of the cave to the place where the children and their coaches have taken refuge
 isamen chah ghante jane or paanch ghante lautan main lagate hai
 According to media reports, about 128 million liters of water was pumped out by Thursday
 gotakhori bhi aasaan nahimbachaav kaaryon ke visheshgy yah salaah bhi de rahe hai ki pani main malba or pedo kii dheron shakhaaen ho sakati hai, jisase bacchon ko chot bhi lag sakati hai
 Apart from swimming, digging in this mountainous area can be another option for children to access, which is extremely difficult because it will require heavy tools
 saath hi vahaan par sateek jagah par khudaai karke bacchon tak pahunch bananaa mushkil he kyonki ho saktaa he ki khudaai karne par jo rasta bane wo kahin or bhi ja saktaa he
 The decreasing water gateway has been closed to prevent water from rising inside the cave
 thai navy gupha ke andar jamaa pani nikaalane kii koshishon main juty he
 Since yesterday, 16 lakh gallons of water have been extracted, but the water level has decreased by only 1 centimeter
 pahaad se riskar vahaan pani turant bhar ja rahaa he
 12 children of the Thailand Under-16 football team and their 25-year-old coach have been stranded there since June 23
 aisa anumaan he ki unhone baari barish kii vajah se gupha main sharan lee thi or barish kii vajah se gupha kaa pravesh dwaara avaruddh ho gaya
 These children are aged between 11 and 16 years
 kya sarkari kharch par study tour ke liye bihar se manipur gaye vidhayak vahaan jaakar ladakiyon ke saath rangareliyaan manaa rahe the?soshal media par jamkar viral ho rahe ek video main dikh rahaa he ki safed kurta-pyjama pahane ek aadmi ladki ke saath abhadra dhang se dance kar rahaa he or jabardastee ladki ko gale lagane kii koshish kar rahaa he
 Another kurta pajama man is dancing together
 daawa ye kiya ja rahaa he ki ye log argedy vidhayak hai
 The video is of Moreh Town, located near the indo-myanmar border
 video ko log khub chatkare lekar share kar rahe hai
 In the video, a man wearing glasses is trying to forcibly hug the girl
 tivi news channel TV9 bharatvarsh or kuch media reports ke mutabik ye aadmi bihar ke supaul se argedy vidhayak yaduvansh yadav he
 News18 has also called these people RJD mlas

 This video is very viral on Facebook and Twitter
 india today anti phek news war room (AFWA) ne is maamle kii padtaal kii or paaya ki dance kar rahe logon main koi bhi vyakti vidhayak nahin he
 The news of TV9 Bharatvarsh, News18, Imphal Times about this is also misleading
 argedy ne apane aadhikarik twitor handle se is khabar kaa khandan kiya he
 The tweet from TV9 Bharatvarsha has now been deleted

 co / wul4id4r0s— Rashtriya Janata Dal (@rjdforindia) June 10, 2019 To know the truth of the case, we first saw the photo of the person in the viral picture mixed with many photos on the internet of RJD MLA Yaduvansh Yadav
 photo nahin milti he
 Then we spoke to Imphal Times editor Rinku as well as MLA Yaduvansh Yadav
 yaduvansh yadav ne bataaya ki wo teen anya vidhayakon ke saath bihar vidhansabha kii 'aantarik sansaadhan or kendriya sahaayta samiti' ke ek study tour par 30 may se 3 june ke bich sachmuch imphal gaye the
 Yaduvansh Yadav is the chairman of this committee, while BJP MLA Sachin Prasad Singh, JDU MLA Raj Kumar Rai and RJD MLA Shivchandra Ram from Raja Pakar are members of this committee
 is yatra ke dauraan unhone imphal ke aas-paas ke kai ilaakon kaa daura kiya, jisamen bharat-myanmar seemaa ke paas sthit moreh toun bhi shaamil tha
 But Yaduwansh Yadav insisted that the person who made objectionable dance with the girl in the viral video is not him but Vijay Kumar, assistant to JDU MLA Raj Kumar Rai
 vijay kumaar bhi patna se in vidhayakon ke saath hi manipur gaye the
 We also talked to Vijay Kumar and he assumed that the person who is dancing is the same
 unhone kaha ki ye ghatana bharat-myanmar ke paas moreh naam kii ek jagah par ek dhabas kii he jahaan wo do june ko party main gaye the
 According to Vijay, no MLA was present at that place
 video main unke saath dance kar rahaa doosraa aadmi raaj sanjeev kumaar he jo unka saathi he
 To confirm this further, we also asked for fresh photographs of both MLA Yaduvansh Yadav and Vijay Kumar
 vaaki ladki se saath dance vijay hi kar rahe hai - vidhayak yaduvansh yadav nahin

 About 20 rounds of firing took place, 4 people were injured in this incident
 police ke mutabik vaardaat jis jagah hui he vahaan bazaar lagata he or bazaar main tamaam rehadi lagati hai
 In this market, a person named Mulla supplies the battery light and takes the fare from the street vendors
 aaj din ke vakt mullah kaa vivaad ek rehadi vaale se ho gaya or shaam ko mullah apane kuch saathiyon ke saath bazaar main aa gaya
 After which a scuffle started between the two sides
 is hathapayee ke bich mullah ke saath aaye jubair ,nasir ,prince or bedaa ne firing kii, jisamen amit or jitendra ke alaava or log bhi ghayal ho gaye
 Zubair himself was injured in the firing, which was captured
 haalanki police is maamle main saaf saaf jaankaree nahin de rahi ki kul kitne log ghayal hue hai
 It is also being said that the reason for the quarrel is speculative
 vaardaat main istemaal kiya gaya hathiyaar bhi baraamad kar liya gaya he
 Currently, police are collecting information from Zubair about his associates
 jubair ke saathiyon kii talash main police aasapaas ke sisitivi footage khangaal rahi he lekin is vaardaat ke baad dilli kii kanoon vyavastha par tamaam sawaal jarur khadey ho gaye hai
 In this case, the DCP of Shahdara said, 'A total of 6 people were shot in the firing that took place last evening in Geeta Colony
 mukhya aaropee jubair hathiyaar ke saath pakadaa gaya ,wo bhi ghayal he
 2 people are caught and their age is being verified
 is firing ke peeche satte kaa koi angel nahin he
 "he said," The reason behind the fight between the 2 factions is that a person named Hashim Mulla rents batteries to the street vendors for light, Hashim asked for a battery from a street vendor, the villager said that the battery is with him No, there was a dispute about it and then everyone went back
 baad main hashim kai logon ko apane saath lekar aayaa or jhagada dobaaraa hua, uske baad firing hui, jisamen duusare gut ke 5 jabaki hashim ke gut kaa jubair ghayal ho gaya
 Police has registered a case of 307 and investigations are on
 ' Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah has the image of a politician who does not believe in superstitions and does not set his direction like astrologers
 lekin mysore main mangalvaar ko jab chamraj nagar zile ke kollegal se aaye kisaan ne unhen laal rang kii ek shawl bhent kerani chaahi to siddharmaiya ne ise lene se manaa kar diya or apni gaadi main baith gaye
 Although this farmer kept trying for a long time with a red shawl, but the security personnel turned him out
 darasal kollegal, chamrajanagar main ek jagah he jo sadiyon se kaale jaadu ke liye badnaam he
 The comments siddharmaiya se pehle is jagah par koi bhi mukhyamantri nahin aayaa
 The extent of this happened when former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda was unaware and left for Chamarajanagar
 aadhe raste main kisi ne yaad dilaayaa ki bich main kollegal bhi padataa he
 What was it then, they stopped their journey there
 helicopter mangaya, tab jaakar chamranagar pahunche
 Recently, when a crow was seen sitting on the official car of Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, his car changed
 us samay media main yah baat uchhali ki andhvishwaas kii vajah se aisa kiya gaya
 Later Siddaramaiah clarified that the car was old and an order to buy a new car had already been placed before the crow could sit
 haalanki mukhyamantri siddharmaiya ne taaja maamle main philhal pratikriya nahin di he ki unhone kollegal ke kisaan se laal shawl lene se inkaar kyon kiya
 The demand for the removal of Siddaramaiah as Chief Minister is intensifying within the Karnataka Congress
 shaayad mukhyamantri ne sochaa hoga ki samay sahi nahin chal rahaa, aise main vivadaspad chizon se dur hi rahaa jaye

 Before Siddaramaiah, no Chief Minister came to this place
 had tab hui jab ek baar purv pradhanmantri echdi devegoda ko dhyaan nahin rahaa or ve chamrajanagar ke liye nikal pade
 Someone halfway reminded that Kollegal falls in the middle
 phir kya tha, unhone apni yatra vahiin roki
 Helicopter ordered, then reached Chamranagar
 haal hi main mukhyamantri siddharmaiya kii offisial car par ek kauwa baitha dikhaa to unki gaadi badal gai
 At that time, it arose in the media that this was done due to superstition
 baad main siddharmaiya ne safai di ki gaadi puraani thi or kauwe ke baithne se pehle hi nai gaadi kharidne kaa order pehle hi diya ja chukaa tha
 However, Chief Minister Siddaramaiah has not yet responded to the latest case as to why he refused to take the red shawl from the Kollegal farmer
 siddharmaiya ko mukhyamantri ke taur par hataane kii maang karnataka congress ke andar tej ho rahi he
 Perhaps the Chief Minister may have thought that the time is not going well, in such a situation should be kept away from controversial things

 Where is Bhanwari? rajasthan kii is laapata nurse kaa abtak koi suraag nahin mil sakaa he
 The minister on whom the finger is being raised in this case has also said that i have nothing to do with this issue
 farsh se arsh tak pahanchi ek nurse kii kahani he ye
 Bhanwari Devi, a nurse by profession, was not fond of patients, but was fond of getting into the colorful world of modeling with her style and that hobby took her among the big names in the power corridors of Rajasthan
 lekin 1 sitambar se bhavari laapata ho gayi
 From the rule of Rajasthan to politics, it is trapped in the whirlpool of questions that where is Bhanwari
 agar uskaa apharan hua to ise anjaam kisne diya
 And there is a question as to whether Bhanwari Devi was killed
 bhavari devi ke pati kaa bayaan rajasthan ke jal sansaadhan mantri mahipal maderna par ungali uthaata he
 About seven-eight years ago, Bhanwari found the post below ANM i
e
 nurse in a government dispensary
 lekin laaparvaahee ke aarope main wo suspend kar di gayi
 In an attempt to save her job, she first met Malkhan Singh Vishnoi and then through Mahipal Maderna through Vishnoi
 maderna kii sifarish par bhavari kii naa sirf bahaali hui, balki apane ghar ke paas ke aspataal main wo aa gayi
 But it is said that by then he had got the chance to get up and down among the high ones
 phir to uski tarakkee is tarah hui ki gaadi, bangala, naukar-chaakar, kya nahin he uske paas
 But some time ago, rumors spread that Bhanwari has a CD of Maderna and Vishnoi, on the strength of which she is blackmailing him
 kehete hai ki iske baad se dono netaaon ne bhavari se duuri badha lee
 But about two and a half months, news started coming that the three have now been compromised
 iske baad phir se teenon ke bich phone par baatcheet bhi shuru ho gai
 The last two and a half month call details confirm this
 par sidi kii charchaa iske baad bhi joro par thi
 Meanwhile, in August, Bhanwari sold his old Swift car to Malkhan Vishnoi's nephew Sohanlal Vishnoi for four and a half lakh rupees
 isamen pachaas hajaar rupee to turant mil gayi lekin kehete hai ki baaki chaar lakh rupee ke liye sohan ne hi ek sitambar ko phone karke bhavari ko bulaayaa tha or tabhi se bhavari gaayab he
 Meanwhile, Minister Mahipal Maderna also disappeared
 lekin guuruuvaar ko wo saamne aae or kaha ki bhavari maamle se unka koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 The state government has announced a CBI inquiry into the case
 lekin ab ye maamla puri tarah siyaasi rang pakad chukaa he
