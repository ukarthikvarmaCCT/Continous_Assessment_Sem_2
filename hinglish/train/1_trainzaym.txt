 unhone westeindies ke liye 27 gendon par 21 ran jarur banaae
 But from the beginning of his innings, Chris Gayle was not seen in color
 11 gend par unhone khaataa kholaa uske baad kuch shats bhi khele
 He missed his catch on the second shot
 iske baad turant unhone hawa main ek baar phir gend oochaal di, kaich to nahin lapka gaya, lekin mohit sharma ke thro ke chalate marlon sampuls ran out ho gaye
 Apparently the pressure was on Gayle, but he was not able to middle the ball with his bat
 yahi vajah he ki shami kii ek short pich gend par unka pul shot hawa main chalaa gaya or mohit sharma ne is baar koi chook nahin kii
 Prior to this match, Chris Gayle was extremely upset with backache
 haalanki match se thik pehle vaale abhyaas satr main unhone hissaa jarur liya, lekin ballebaazi ke dauraan ve sahaj nahin dikh rahe the
 With this innings, Gayle could not recover from his failure against Team India for the past 9 years
 unhone bharat ke kilaaf apana aakhri shatak 2006 main banaaya tha
 After this, he has played 20 odis against India, and has not scored a century in it
 in maichon main unhone 471 ran banaae hai, wo bhi mahaj 23 kii ausat se
 Not only this, his failure continued on Perth's Waka pitch
 bhale hi duniya ke kisi bhi maidan par tufaani pari khilne kaa dam rakhte hon, lekin hakeekat yahi he ki perth ke vaaka maidan par ab tak unka balla khamosh rahaa he
 Chris Gayle has played four odis so far in Perth and his scores have been 0, 4, 4 and 21 in these three matches
 
 
 
 In this World Cup, he scored the fastest double century of ODI against Zimbabwe but he has managed to score just 63 runs in the remaining four matches

 (’pahchaan chhipaane ke liye sabhi peediton ke naam badal die gaye hai) Talking of Congress in Delhi, the figure of 36 between the party's current state Ajay Maken and former Chief Minister Sheila Dixit was not hidden from anyone
 maakan ne jab dilli congress adhyaksh pad kii jimmedaari sanbhali thi to shila ko beetaa hua yug tak qaraar de daalaa tha
 Sheela also left no stone unturned to counter Maken
 baharhaal, donon ke bich tanatani kii khabaren saamne aati raheen
 At the same time, Congress led by Maken lost one election after another in Delhi
 vidhansabha chunaav main party kaa safaya hua to nigam chunaavon main bhi congress tisare number par rahi
 Although Maken cited Congress's vote share increase, Sheila said in its cut that elections are fought to win and not to increase vote share
 maakan se naaraaz rahaa he shila kaa khemashila akeli hin nahin, kapil sibbal, jai prakaash agarwal samet shila sarkaar ke vakt mantri rahe tamaam netaa bhi maakan kii kaaryastylee se khuleam naaraazgi jataane lage
 Maken's complaint reached Rahul's court
 tab rahul ne hastkshep karte hue maakan se maamle ko dekhne ke liye kaha
 Probably gave this message to take everyone along
 rahul ke kareebi maane jane vaale maakan ne phir nae sire se dilli main party sanghathan ke keel-kaante durust karne shuru kiye
 Then the story started, reconciliation between Maken and Sheila was realized
 haalanki shuruyaat main hi shila ne maakan ko jhatka de diya
 According to sources, Maken's office sent a message to Sheila's office that Ajay Maken wanted to meet Sheila Dixit herself
 shila ke daftar ne jab shila ko ye jaankaree di to shila ne aisi kisi mulaakaat kii sambhaavna se saaf inkaar kar diya
 Maken's efforts to persuade Sheela continued after this and asked Sharmistha Mukherjee, the daughter of Delhi Pradesh Mahila Congress president and former President Pranab Mukherjee's daughter, to talk to Sheila in this regard and finalize a meeting
 sharmishtha ne shila ko manaaya or antat: maakan sharmishtha ke saath shila se milane unke ghar pahunche
 According to the sources, at the beginning of the meeting, Maken tied Sheela's praises and said, 'I want your blessings
 puure dilli main aapaki sarkaar ke vakt ke kaam ko log yaad karte hai
 So, accept my request, in the coming elections, you should cooperate fully
 sabase pehle 14 farvari ko dilli congress ke bade netaaon ke saath aap bhi media ko ek manch se sambodhit karne aaie
 According to the sources, in response to this, Sheela said, 'maken ji, first stop watching people according to your preference of dislike for AAP
 sab puraane logon ko eisisi member banaaie
 On February 14, call all the old ministers and senior leaders, then i will also come
 ’maakan ne is par aashwaasan diya ki agle din sabko edjust karne kii puri koshish ke baad unase milenge
 Sources said that the next day Maken met Sheela alone
 saath hi shila se un logon ke naam liye jinhen ve eisisi member banvaanaa chaahati thim
 Then a day later Maken reached Sheela's house with PC Chacko in charge of Delhi
 maakan ne shila kii pasand ke kaaphi logon ko to edjust kar diya, lekin 6 naamon ko lekar kaha ki inako lenaa mushkil he
 Sheila still remained adamant
 shila ne maakan se saaf kaha ki ye saare congressi hai, aapako nahin pasand to usase kya?nai dosti kii shuruyaat?darasal, in 6 naamon main shila sarkaar main mantri rahe mangatraam singhl, ramakant goswami, vidhayak rahe rajesh lilothia, purv parshad jitu kochar, rohit manachanda or shila sarkaar ke vakt dilli essi kamishan ke chairman rahe harnaam shaamil hai
 Maken did not allow them to become PCC delegates
 ab duvidha he ki jo pisisi delygat nahin he, wo eisisi kaa member kaise banegaa? aise main eisisi kaa manonith member banaakar maakan bich kaa rasta nikaalane kii taiyaari main hai
 Although the nominated member does not have the right to vote, it is likely to be reconciled
 isi ke chalate haal main purv adhyaksh subhash chopra, purv mantri eke walia or haaron usoof kii dilli congress mukhyalay main press conference bhi hui
 Amidst the entire development and in the wake of sheila-maken's recent meetings, it is believed that on February 14, Valentine's Day will mark the beginning of a new chapter for the Delhi Congress
 dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki ye taarikh shila or maakan ke bich siyaasi melmilaap kii gavaah banegi to aage chalakar uskaa dilli main party kii sehat par kya asar hoga? dilli main congress ke din palatney ke liye jaruri he ki party ke ye donon diggaj dil se haath milaayein, kisi majaburi main nahin

 Dug out of the mountain
 mumbai main kuch aisa hi hua
 On Saturday, May 23, there was no parachute ballooning at the Mumbai airport
 airport police ne is maamle main ek event company ke 2 logon ko giraftaar kiya
 Arrested Kunal Shah is the owner of the event company while Nilesh Srimankar is the employee of that company
 mumbai police ke sanyukt police ayukta deven bharti ke mutabik donon ne kabool kiya he ki shanivaar ko airport ke paas hi air india ground par ek cricket tournament ke shubharambh main unhone gas se bhare gubbaaron ke guchchhe udaae the
 Under the balloons, the strips bearing the name of the cricket team were hung
 vahi gubaare airport ke upar se udate hue dekhe gaye the jinhen parachute samaj liya gaya tha
 DCP Virendra Mishra of the area said that Dharmanand Diamond Private Limited Company and 4 banks had organized a cricket competition for their personnel
 aayojan kii jimmedaari kunal shah kii event company ko di gai thi
 On the evening of 23 May, a Jet Airways pilot was seen flying 5 parachutes in the sky of the airport
 turant atisi ko soochna di gai thi
 ATC also approved the parachute and precautionary flights were suspended from the airport for some time
 kyonki udaan ke samay parachute hawaii jahaaj se takaraa sakate the
 Which could have caused a big accident
 iske alaava chashmadidon ne daawa kiya tha ki parachute hawa ke viparit disha main ud rahe the isliye ho saktaa he ki wo remote se sanchalit ho rahe honge
 So were the cameras in the parachute? Was there any conspiracy? Such questions were beginning to arise
 suraksha main is chook se mumbai police sahit siaiesaf, dijisie, bisiees, airforce or ibi bhi sakate main aa gai thi
 But surprisingly, it was not known for two days where and how the parachutes came from, while there is a ban on flying any object around the airport
 haalanki shuruyaat main police se lekar airport se judi sabhi agenciyon ne pehle aasmaan main parachute ke maamle ko halke main liya tha
 But as soon as the photo of the parachute came in the media, everyone got into action and a statement was recorded from the pilot to the ATC personnel who saw the parachute from the telescope
 airport ke aasapaas ke sabhi police thanon ko bhi parachute kii talash me jutana padaa tha
 According to an officer at the airport police station, during interrogation in the vicinity, it was found that the first parachute was seen near the airport's gate number eight, there is Air India ground nearby
 vahaan shanivaar ko ek bada event hua tha or aasmaan main gubaare udaae gaye the
 The police then called the owner of the event company, Kunal Shah, on the pretext, to get information about the event and after seeing the photos of the balloons, it was confirmed that a case was registered against both
 tippaniyan Police registered a case of negligence under Section 188, 336 on both of them and produced them in the court of Andheri where the court granted bail to both of them on a personal bond of Rs 10,000 each
 jamaanat par chhootane ke baad kunal ke mitra ne bataaya ki media main khabar dekhne ke baad wo log khud police ke saamne hajir hue the
 They did not know that flying balloons was forbidden there
 pehle bhi us maidan par aise event ho chuke hai lekin kabhi kisi ne nahin roka
 However, the Mumbai Police along with all other agencies attached to the airport have breathed a sigh of relief after the balloon was replaced in place of the parachute
 lekin ye kahana bhi galat nahin hoga ki airport kii suraksha main chook hui he or uski samiksha jaruri he

 " bihar ke liye special package ke elaan par raajnneeti tej ho gai he
 On Thursday, Union Communications Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad complained that Nitish Kumar had been demanding a special package for a long time and did not even thank him when the PM announced it
 ravishankar ne kaha, 'mujhe pidaa hui ki nitish kumaar ne bihar package ke liye ek baar bhi piem kaa dhanyavad nahin kiya'
 This is bjp's new attack on Nitish Kumar after a package of Rs 1
25 lakh crore for Bihar
 magar jediu kaa jawaab saafe he- piem ne koi ehsaan nahin kiya
 JDU leader KC Tyagi told NDTV, 'this is the right of the states
 piem ne bihar par koi ehsaan nahin kiya

 udhar jedy-you kii daleel he ki niteesha ne special package kii maang kabhi nahin kii, wo hameshaa bihar ko vishesh darza dilaane kii maang karte rahe hai
 The question is also on this special package
 bihar ko jo sava lakh karod milane hai, ve kab milenge or kis tarah milenge
 JDU alleges that it has been added to the scheme of the new-old and the coming years
 kasee tyaagi kehete hai, 'is package main kai 2014-15 ke bajtiy praposal hai

 unhone kaha, 'kisi bhi project ko puraa karne main jitna vakt lagegaa, utana lagegaa
 
 
 '
 ab is special package ko nitish-lalu bihar ke swabhimaan ke mudde se jodne kii koshish main hai
 Obviously, this will remain an important issue in Bihar elections
 bihar ke liye sava lakh karod ke package ke baad nitish kumaar par yah bijepi kaa nayaa hamalaa he
 But jdu's answer is clear - PM did not do any favor
 jediu netaa kasee tyaagi ne enditivi se kaha, 'ye rajyon kaa haq he

 endie sarkaar kaa daawa he ki nitish kumaar lambey samay tak centre sarkaar se special package kii maang karte rahe hai or ab jab piem ne elaan kiya to uskaa dhanyavad bhi nahin diya
 On the other hand, JD-U argues that Nitish never asked for a special package, he has always been demanding a special status for Bihar

 When will Bihar get 125 lakh crores, when will they meet and how will they get it
 jediu kaa aarope he ki nai-puraani or aane vaale saalon kii skim tak isamen jod di gai he
 KC Tyagi says, "there are several budgetary proposals of 2014-15 in this package

 The party also included actors Kunal Verma, Rashmi Desai and Jasmine Bhasin associated with the show
 sutron kii maane to is party ke dauraan sharaab ke nashe main siddharth ne kunal ke saath kaaphi gaali-galoch kii
 Even when Kunal told him that he was not doing right, Siddharth was seen shouting at him
 haryana congress main siyaasi varchasv kii jang purv mukhyamantri bhupinder singh hooda or congress pradesh adhyaksh ashok tanvar ke bich jagajaahir he
 The two leaders have their respective camps in the province and have been playing openly against each other
 ab lagata he ye raajnneetik varchasv kii jang party main baghawat kaa rup akhriyaar karne kii disha main bad chuki he
 Bhupinder Singh Hooda is looking for a new political path beyond the Congress
 is kadi main bijepi kii taraf bhi unhone ummid bhari najaron se dekhnaa shuru kar diya he
 At the same time, BJP also needs the strength of a Jat leader who can help the Jats
 darasal haryana main satta gavaanne ke baad bhi congress kii anduruni kalah khatm hone kaa naam nahin le rahi he
 Hooda and Tanvarkhema have been raising the flag of revolt against each other for the last three years
 lekin party alaakaman iskaa samaadhaan nahin nikaal paa rahi he
 This is the reason that Bhupinder Singh Hooda is now looking for a new political base
 sutron kii maane to pichley ek saptaah main hooda ne pradhanmantri narendra modi se do baar mulaakaat kii he
 This meeting may have been a few minutes, but this meeting has intensified the political stir in the state
 is mulaakaat ko hooda kheme ke log shishtachar kii mulaakaat bataa rahe hai, lekin iske siyaasi myne he
 Hooda has made his plans known to the Congress high command by meeting Modi
 ashok tanvarake haathon se party kii kaman lekar unhen nahin di jaati to party ko chhodkar bijepi kaa daaman thaamne main wo der nahin karenge
 Hooda has been pressuring the party high command through his pro-mlas and party leaders for the last nearly three years to be given the command of the Haryana Congress
 hooda samarthak vidhayak kai baar khuleam congress adhyaksh ashok tanvar or vidhayak dal kii netaa kiran choudhary ko badalane kii maang uthaa chuke hai
 While Hooda is searching for his political whereabouts on the one hand, on the other hand, the Jats have become angry with the BJP in the state, causing uneasiness in the BJP as well
 jabaki bijepi ke paas captain abhimanyu or choudhary birendra singh jat netaa he, lekin hooda ke baraabar siyaasi kad in donon netaaon kaa nahin he
 Recently, resentment has increased in Jat society regarding Jat reservation
 yahi vajah he ki bijepi ko shiddat ke saath kaddavar jat netaa kii talash rahi he
 Realizing the fragility of the occasion, Hooda has made a big bet
 sutron kii maane to bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ke jariye hooda apni siyaasi gotiyaan bichaai he

 Zhang, a general of the People's Liberation Army, committed suicide in November 2017
 is aatmahatya ne sabko hairaan jarur kiya lekin yah ghatana pehali nahin thi
 According to government figures, 158 Chinese officers have committed suicide between 2012 and 2017

 us vakt red guard ke haathon jansangharsh sunwaayiyon main beijjati se pareshaan hajaaron logon ne khud aage badhkar maut ko gale laga liya tha

 Those were the four years that followed when a mass campaign against corruption swept over the Chinese state and thousands of officers were eliminated in the name of purification
 is dauraan 158, yani har saal 39, aatmahatya darj huin
 Maya Wang, a researcher at Hong Kong-based Human Rights Watch and studying the party's repression against corruption, says, "being a CPC officer has become a matter of great stress these days and the increasing number of suicides seems to be a definite trend
" ''wang yah bhi kahati hai ki ''jinhone khud apni jaan lee hai, unamem se kai kisi na kisi shakl main jaanch ke ghere main the or logon kaa maananaa he ki isaki ek vajah yah he ki agar ve maut ko gale laga lenge to jaanch band ho jaaegi'' or is tarah ve apane sahyogiyon, pariwaron or sampattiyon kii hifaazat kar sakenge
 Maya Wang of Human Rights Watch says, "making a commission can be a good move, but i would doubt it
 sisidii ek gaiyrkanoonee damankaaree vyavastha ko zyaadaatar ek aisi vyavastha main tabdeel kar rahi he jisaki kanoonee shakl to hogi par jo utani hi damankaaree hogi

" isliye isse mere aatmavishvaas main badhotaree hogi
 Saina had a 1-0 record against Marin, playing a few excellent shots against her opponent and playing an excellent volley to take a 5-2 lead in the opening game
 lekin 21-varshiya marin bhi aasaani se pichhadane vaali nahin thi or unhone is antar ko kam kar 6-8 kar diya
 Marin, however, made a mistake in the service and gave Saina an easy score as the Indian took an 11-7 lead
 marin ne phir apane khel main sudhaar kiya, lekin sina bhi javaabi hamale ke liye taiyaar thim or unhone apni pratidwandvi ke smash kaa teji se jawaab diya
 Meanwhile, Marin played some of the best strokes, but these were not sustained and Saina led 17–12
 marin kii patibaddhta har ank ke liye dekhi ja sakati thi, lekin sanyamit sina ko pachhaadne ke liye yah kaaphi nahin thi
 Saina was not impressed with Marin's aggressive feelings and the Hyderabadi won the first game 21-18 in 23 minutes

 lekin shaayad marin se prerit hokar sina ne bhi kuch bhaavnaayen dikhain, vah prayek ank hasil karne ke baad apni kalai bheenchakar 'kam on' chillaate hue dikhin
 But once his scream came in the middle of the rally, Marin complained to the chair umpire, who asked him to continue playing
 marin ko is dhyaan bhang hone se koi phayda nahin hua or sina ne is spanish khilaadi par 11-4 kii badhat bana lee
 After the break, Saina continued to dominate and regularly instigated Marin to make mistakes, who struggled to show up in the early game
 sina ne iske baad apane kuch paaramparik smash lagaakar pratidwandvi kaa manobal gira diya, jisase uske kandhe jhuke hue dikh rahe the
 But there were some dramatic moments before the victory
 sina 19 -9 se badhat banaae thim, lekin unhone ek 'line kol' ko chunauti di, jo unke khilaaf rahi
 But the replays showed the shuttle went wide
 is bhartiya ne ek or galati kii, aglaa ank khelte hue unhone net main smash kiya
 Saina, however, made up for it quickly and won the title by playing wide shots from Marin

 ab zaraa uske laharaate tamanchey or pili pant se nazaren hate to uski un teen mahila doston se bhi mil lijie jinhen pandey ji ne khaas dubai se bulawaaya tha
 Two of these three are British citizens while the third lives in Dubai
 inamen se ek kaa naam pamela he
 Anyone can befriend Pamela by visiting social media
 phir dost ban chuki pamela or uski doston ko duniya ke kisi bhi kone main bula saktaa he
 Be mindful of 
 This friendship is not free
 yahaan dosti kii keemat adaa kerani padati he or pandeya ji ne us raat keemat adaa karne ke baad hi in kharide hue doston ko dilli bulaayaa tha
 On the night of 14 October, the stage was hoisted in the porch of the famous five-star Hyatt Hotel in Delhi
 15 oktober ko ye video viral hua or 16 aktubar ko dinabhar desh kii media par ye khabar chai rahi
 All eyes were focused on this gunman's gun and his pink pants
 kisi ne bhi is gulabi chehre vaali ladki par dhyaan nahin diya
 These are Pamela Rouge
 punjabi hai par british hai or dubai main kaaphi mashhoor hai
 Especially among those who have to come to Dubai often
 angrezi main inke profeshan ko soshal partner yaa friend kehete hai
 But there is no decent word for this profession in our language
 bas aap ye samaj lijie ki ye ek tarah ki peshewar dost hai
 Which does not let unknown people miss the brunt of a good friend
 par inaki dosti or inke apanepan kii ek keemat hoti he
 It charges a fee to maintain friendship and stay with a friend
 jaise in pamela ko agar aap aapnaa dost bana kar inke saath kuch vakt gujaarna chahen to pehle inhen dosti kii keemat ke taur par 18 hajaar dirham kii adaayagi kerani hogi
 If it is converted into rupees, then it is about three and a half lakh rupees

 or unhen follow karne waalon kii koi kami nahin he
 Moreover, Pamela has also posted a lot of photos on her Twitter account
 jinamein zyaadaatar main wo apane yphone se selfi leti nazar aa rahi hai
 It is believed that some people also increase their closeness through their Twitter
 magar pamela ruz kaa ye apnaapan sirf chuninda logon ke liye hota he
 Which is called VVIP
 agar aisa koi viviipi jo dubai ke alaava kisi or desh main rahata he to ye usase dosti nibhaane ke liye vahaan bhi chali jaati hai
 But for this, that friend has to bear the cost of everyone coming to them, staying and eating
 purv bispi saansad rakesh pandeya ke bete ashish pandeya bhi shaayad in dinon kuch akelaapan mahasoos kar rahe the
 So he called his friend from Dubai
 pink patalun vaale ashish pandey ke akelepan kaa alam ye tha ki unhone use dur karne ke liye pamela ke saath-saath uski do or doston ko bhi bulawaaya tha
 All three were present with female friend Ashish while he was waving his pistol at Hotel Hyatt in Delhi
 ye tab bhi unheen ke saath thim jab wo apni mahangi bmadblu car main aakar baithe the
 And the wall was referring to writing the revolution after the vessel
 zaahir he dosti ke liye teen-teen doston ko dubai se flite se bulaane
 Pandeyji must have blown away ten to fifteen lakhs to stay in a five-star hotel, eat and drink
 ab pistal lahraane ke baad vakeelon kaa kharchaa alag
 It is obvious that the friendship bought this time became more expensive

 After this, he was again asked why it is strange when Madhuri and Ishaan talk about an affair in the film, but it does not seem strange when 53-year-old Salman Khan romances a 21-year-old girl? "I think if i were 50 years old and romancing a 22-year-old man, it would definitely be strange for me, then this is my personal opinion
" aapako salmaan se is bare main poochna chahie ki ve kya kha rahe hai or aisa kya kar rahe hai ki 53 kii umr main bhi ve yang actraces ke saath romance kar rahe hai

 But a large number of Pakistani soldiers are mobilizing in the Samba sector

 Expressing strong opposition from Pakistan over the latest ceasefire violation, Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar said that it seemed as if Pakistan had not learned any lesson

 Meanwhile, Inspector General of Border Security Force Rakesh Sharma has said, "pakistan has broken the rules on the international border

 karnataka main jedies netaa echdi kumaraswami ke mukhyamantri ke taur par shapath lene se pehle achaanak logon kii dilchaspee us photo ko lekar kaaphi bad gayi he jisamen wo ek khubasurat mahila or ek bacchee ke saath dikh rahe hai
 It is being said about this photo that she is the second wife of 58-year-old Kumaraswamy who is 27 years younger than her
 is photo ke viral hone ke baad log soshal media par khub chatkhaare bhi le rahe hai or internet par is khubasurat mahila ko khub khoj bhi rahe hai
 Radhika has become one of the most searched people on Google in India for the last two-three days after being photo-veiled
 ham aapako bataate hai is tasviir kii asaliyat or kumaraswami ke saath is mahila ke sambandhon ke bare main puri kahani
 The woman with whom Kumaraswamy is seen in the photo is Radhika
 radhika kannada or telugu filmon kii abhinetri or nirmaataa hai jinhone 30 se zyada filmon main kaam kiya he
 Kumaraswamy and Radhika's relationship began around 2005
 koun hai radhikaayahaa ye bataanaa jaruri he ki 2006 se 2007 ke bich karnataka ke mukhyamantri rahe kumaraswami kannada filmon se bhi jude rahe hai
 He has been a producer and distributor in Kannada films
 radhika or kumaraswami ke sambandhon kii charchaa to karnataka kii raajnneeti main pehle bhi khub hoti rahi he lekin kumaraswami saarvajanik taur par ise sweekaar karne se bachate rahe hai
 The reason for this was that Kumaraswamy, born on 16 December 1959, was married to Anita in 1986
 unka nikhil naam kaa ek betaa bhi he
 You can guess how much Radhika is younger than Kumaraswamy at the age that Radhika was born the same year when Kumaraswamy was married to Anita
 rishton par chup rahe kumaraswamijaahir he kumaraswami raajnneeti main hone kii vajah se radhika ke saath sambandhon ko lekar zyaadaatar chup rahe or ise nijee maamla bataate rahe
 But their relationship was confirmed when Radhika herself admitted in some newspapers in November 2010 that she had been married to Kumaraswamy in 2006 itself
 radhika ne tabhi is baat kaa bhi khulaasa kiya tha ki unki ek saal kii beti bhi he jiskaa naam shamika he
 Kumaraswamy still remained silent on the matter but the matter reached the court in 2011 regarding his relationship with Radhika
 oktober 2011 main bengalooru ke ek vakil shashidhar belagumbe ne hoicourt main janhit yachika daakhil karke ye maang rakhi ki kumaraswami kii loksabhaa kii sadsyta khatm kar di jaae kyonki unhone gaiyrkanoonee tareeke se pehali patni ke rahete, radhika se duusari shaadi kar lee he
 The court dismissed the petition for lack of evidence
 iske baad 2014 main ek baar phir bengalooru kii ek patrkaar nagalakshmi bai ne rajya chunaav ayog ko shikaayat kar di jisamen kaha gaya ki 2013 main vidhansabha chunaav ke liye daakhil shapath patr main kumaraswami ne apni duusari patni radhika kumaraswami ke bare main jaankaree chhipaai
 But by this time, everyone had come to know about Kumaraswamy and Radhika's relationship
 shaadi ko lekar pakke saboot bhi saamne aa rahe the
 Such pictures have surfaced which reveal that on 16 December 2012, Kumaraswamy celebrated his birthday with Radhika and her daughter
 in tasveeron kii tab khub charchaa hui thi
 The picture of Radhika and Kumaraswamy now going viral is actually four years old
 van india naam kii ek website ne in tasveeron ko 15 janvari 2014 ko chapa tha
 According to the website, four pictures of the occasion were uploaded by Radhika herself on her Facebook page
 radhika ne in photo ke saath likhaa tha ki shamika ab chaar saal kii ho gai he
 It was not mentioned in the photo that the place where this photo is taken and when it was taken
 saal 2015 aate-aate radhika or kumaraswami ke sambandhon me daraar aane lagi
 It is believed that one of the reasons was the pressure from his son Nikhil, who was not comfortable with his father's relationship with Radhika
 khabaron ke mutabik radhika ke saath sambandhon ko lekar kumaraswami ke pita ech di devegoda bhi naaraaz the
 In October 2015, there were many such reports in the media that Kumaraswamy and Radhika have now separated
 haalanki radhika ne 2017 main ek press conference main puche gaye sawaal ke jawaab main kaha tha ki unke naam main ab bhi kumaraswami judaa he or ant tak judaa rahegaa
 Radhika has once again become active in Kannada and Telugu films and this year her next Kannada film 'rajendra Ponnappa' is going to be released in which famous Kannada actor Ravichandran is her hero

 isaki vajah bataate hue unhone kaha ki kai siton par isliye ye maamla dekhne ko mil rahaa he kyonki siton par gathbandhan ke pehle hi ummidavaaron ko simbel mil gaye the
 It is worth mentioning that this time the SP and Congress are contesting the elections in alliance
 sapa apana ghoshnaptr pehle hi jari kar chuki he
 Along with this, Azad also said that reports of differences between the SP and the Congress on the issue of some seats are baseless
 unhone kaha ki jin siton par donon dalon ke ummidavaar lard rahe hai vahaan kisi seat par wo tikat waapas le rahe hai or kisi seat par ham apane tikat waapas le rahe hai
 Explaining the reason for this, he said that this issue is being seen in many seats because the candidates had got symbols before the alliance on the seats
 ullekhneey he ki is baar sapa or congress gathbandhan karke chunaav lard rahi hai
 The SP has already released its manifesto

 Al Qaeda, the world's most dreaded terrorist organization, has given a similar advertisement on the Internet to prepare suicide bombers

 kisi aatanki sanghathan kii tarah is tarah kii khuli bhartee ke vigyaapan kaa ye anokhaa maamla he
 Until now, Al Qaeda used websites to take responsibility and threaten various terrorist attacks

 Last year, Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was killed in an attack by American Navy seals Kamados
 do din pehle al kaayda kaa second in cmand al libi ke dron hamale main maare jane kii khabar ai thi
 After these tremors, Al Qaeda seems to be in the grip of a big attack again and for that it needs a dreaded suicide squad

 nabbe ke dashak main bahucharchit televijan dharawahik ramayana main ravan ke senapati akampan kaa role adaa karne vaale bank adhikari murarilal gupta ne ritairement ke baad apni sari jamaa-puunji ek aise kaarobaar main lagane kii sochi jo munaafe kaa dhandha ho
 But this business was full of fun and he was a novice in this business, so his wife strongly opposed it
 lekin gupta ne develper banane kii thaan lee thi, so unhone ranchi ke bich kachhari chowk par apane paanch katthe kii jameen parapaanch manjila apartmentbanane kii thaan lee or lone bhi juta liya
 Their entire day passes between cement, sand and brick
 gupta bataate hai, ''main jo bana rahaa hum vah sasta, sulabh or tikaoo he
 People are coming for booking
 ab main aapako is dhandhe kii or bhi baarikiyon ke bare main bataa saktaa hum
 "of course, his apartment is dwarfed by the skyscrapers erected so far by the real estate players of Ranchi, but their motives are touching the sky and they are looking to elevate them even further
 baarah saal pehle jab ranchi, is nae rajya jharkhand kii rajdhani bana tha, tab bilkul bhi aisa nahin tha
 It was developed by the British due to the better weather of Ranchi, where there are still a good number of houses of the old British and gentle Bengalis
 lekin vah sab kancreet ke oonche-oonche jangalon ke bich kho gaye hai
 In terms of height, Ranchi does not seem to be competing against a metro like Delhi anywhere, but it cannot be said that in the coming times, it cannot beat the three-tier cities in terms of height
 shahar ke ati vyastatam lalpur ilaake kaa aath manjila hariom tower jo kaarobaari gatividhiyon kaa sabase bada centre he yaa phir kanke road kaa panchvati plaza, uma shanti apartment shriram garden yaa phir rashmirathi apartment se ranchi kii akaash chooti growth kaa jabardast najaara liya ja saktaa he
 These towers are a favorite of urban elite
 salbhar pehle tak sunsaan ilaaka samajhe jane vaale kanke road par aaj takreeban ek darjan oonchi imaaraton ke dhaanche khadey ho rahe hai
 Pooja Harit, who lives on the last floor of Rashmirathi, an eight-storey building in the same area, says, "you get a fun opportunity to see the city from such a height and behold the sun setting in the evening
" yahi is apartment kii sabase khaas baat bhi kahi ja sakati he
 “currently, Uma Shanti is the tallest apartment in residential buildings with 12 floors while residential work is going on at 13 to 20 storey apartments
 vahiin kashish develper kii yojana ranchi main takreeban 10 acre main nirmaanadhin cell city main 20 manjila apartment banane kii he
 Rajneesh, manager of Kashish Developer, explains
 ''duplex makaan vaale muhalle basaane se behatar he ki aap har tarah kii suvidhaon se las oonche apartment banaaen
 The entire locality itself is in an apartment
 aap aise main ucch or madhyam aay varg, donon ko hi makaan uplabdh karvaa sakate hai
 Ranchi is following the metro path in terms of high apartments
 takreeban 30 lakh kii aabaadi vaale is shahar main aisa hone ke kai kaaran hai
 Chandrakant Raypath, a Ranchi entrepreneur and associated with the construction business, explains the reason, "ranchi's population is growing wildly and land is limited
 shahari ilaakon par aabaadi kaa jabardast dabaav bad chukaa he, aise main yahi ek rasta bachataa he
 Singh Singh, Piska, Hawai Nagar, Oramanjhi, Nagri, Kanke countryside, Dhurwa, Booti Mod and Ring Road are the newly emerging areas of Ranchi, where over one and a half dozen schemes are in the works
 jharkhand chembar of commers and industry ke sadsy manoj naredi kehete hai, ''jab saal 2000 main jharkhand kaa gathan hua tha us samay ranchi main real estate kaa kaarobaar mahaj 150 karod ru
 Was around Rs 1,500 crore mark
 ” ranchi main hi takreeban 200 chote-bade builder is kaarobaar main lage hai
 All these newly developed areas are 20 to 30 kilometers away from the main Ranchi which is the most suitable place for middle class people
 2005 main real estate develper gautam green city ne ranchi ke bahari ilaake booti mode main pehle township kaa nirmaan shuru kiya
 So far, construction work has been done on 10 acres in Gautam Green City spread over 30 acres, on which most of the bungalows and duplexes are located and all the houses have been sold
 ranchi ke bahari ilaake (hawaii nagar or piska) main aaj bhi 20-25 lakh ru
 a flat of three rooms is found in the house, whereas inside Ranchi (ashok Nagar, Kanke Road and Lalpur), the flat that was sold there a year ago for Rs 30-35 lakhs
 kaa hua karata tha, ab vah 50-55 lakh ru
 Has reached gautam green ke project manager rajesh singh kehete hai, ''ab ham oonche apartment ko adhik tarjeeh de rahe hai
 Our consumer class is middle class who want to make a home in their Ranchi
 ranchi ab ubharta hua vyavsaayik centre ban chukaa he, is lihaaj se bade or oonche mal or bijness complex ban rahe hai
 “now this expansion is happening not in the spread but towards the heights

 PTI has announced that Imran Khan will take oath of Pakistan's wazir-e-azam before Independence Day
 party ne aaazaad saansadon or choti partiyon ke saath milakar gathbandhan sarkaar banane kaa daawa kiya he
 Pakistan tehreek-e-insaf (PTI) has emerged as the largest party in Pakistan after the general elections held on July 25, although the party does not have the requisite numbers to form the government on its own
 pitiai netaa nainul haq ne beeti raat media ko bataaya ki sankhya bal puraa karne ke liye salaah-mashvira jari he
 Haq said, 'we have done our work and he (imran Khan) will take oath as Prime Minister before August 14
 'pitiai ko mili 116 sitempakistan nirvachan ayog (isipi) dwaara ghoshit puure sansadeey nateezon ke anusaar pitiai ko 116 aam siten mili hai jo saadhaaran bahumat se 11 kam hai
 PML-N and PPP have got 64 and 43 seats respectively
 sansad ke nichle sadan pakistan kii neshnal assembly (ene) main kul 342 sadsy hai jisamen se 272 siton kaa chunaav sidhe taur par hota he or sarkaar gathan ke liye 172 siten hasil karnaa jaruri he
 However, there has been a spurt in political activities and all the parties are holding open meetings and secret dialogues to raise sufficient strength on the board of politics
 pakistani media ke anusaar do pramukh partiyaan pakistan pipuls party (pipipi) or pakistan muslim lig-navaj (piemail-en), sansad main pitiai ko kadi takkar dene ke iraade se sanyukt ranneeti banane ke liye aane vaale dinon main baithak kar sakati hai
 On the other hand, PTI leaders who have won more than one seat will have to vacate the other seats because according to the law, a candidate can represent only one seat
 pitiai ke adhyaksh khan ne paanch siton se jeet darj kii he, isliye unhen chaar siten khaali kerani hongi
 Ghulam Sarwar Khan from Taxila, who defeated former Home Minister Chaudhary Nisar Ali Khan, has also won two NA seats so he too will have to give up one seat
 khaybar pakhtoonkhwaa kepurv mukhyamantri parvej khatakane bhi neshnal assembly or prantiy assembly donon siton par jeet darj kii haiy isliye agar pitiai unhen mukhyamantri ke pad ke liye phir se namankit karti he to unhen bhi ene seat chhodani hogeey aise main party kii siten ghatakar 109 ho jaaengi
 This is the reason why the PTI leadership has now decided to approach other small groups and independents
 party pehle hi yah ghoshnaa kar chuki he ki vah piemail-en or pipipi ke saath gathjod nahin karegi
 It is estimated that even if the PTI gains the support of the GDA, MQM-P, PML-Q and Awami Muslim League, this number will be 122, which is 15 less than the required strength

 They are trying to save the leftovers by keeping them in the sun

 The flood waters have ruined the valuable items of every household

 yahaan tak ki unako kapade bhi daan main lene par majaboor hona padaa he
 However, religious institutions in the village are arranging copies of books, food and drink, from medicines to schools
 sarkaar ne madad kaa bharosa to jarur diya he, lekin abhi tak in baadh prabhavit ilaakon tak sarkaar kii madad nahin pahunchi he
 Flood became a problem for widow Balveer Kaur Flood came as a problem for 70-year-old widow Balveer Kaur from a village in Phulkala

 We will keep pressure on the opposition team both at the beginning and the end
 unhone kaha tha yah sab kuch samay or ham apane plan ko kaise amal main laate hai is par nirbhar karegaa
 In Indian cricket, legendary batsmen like Sunil Gavaskar, Sachin Tendulkar and Virat Kohli have a successful long history, but it is rarely discussed that who is the first Indian batsman to face the first ball at the international level? He started his journey in international cricket in 1932 through Test
 bhartiya cricket team ne 1932 main june ke maheene main england kaa daura kiya or pehla test match khelaa tha
 Today, we remember India's first batsman Janardan Navale (photo-espn) on his 115th birthday, the match between the two teams on June 25 at Lord's called 'cricket's Mecca'
 toss jitkar mejabaan england ne pehle ballebaaji kaa faisla liya or puri team 259 ran banaakar out ho gai
 After this, it was India's turn to bat and for him, the opening pair of Jardan Navalay and Naumal Geomal made a good start to the first pair
 Born on 7 December 1902, Navalay started his first innings at the age of 30
 Faced and became India's first batsman
 is tarah se bharat ke khilaaf test main pehali gend daalane kaa shrey wiliam bous ko gaya
 Navel added a 39-run partnership for the first wicket with Geomal
 haalanki acchhee saajhedaari ke baad bharat kii puri team duusare din 189 ran par out ho gai
 Navel scored 12 runs in the first innings and 13 in the second innings
 13 ranon kii pari unki sarvshereshth pari rahichhote kad ke naawale behtareen ballebaaj the or us samay ke saphaltam ballebaaj jaik hobbs ne unhen mahaan ballebaajon kii shrenee main shaamil kiya tha
 He played only 2 Test matches in his career
 kariyar kaa doosraa or aakhri test 1933-34 main mumbai main england ke hi khilaaf khelaa
 Now the 31-year-old Navalay was dropped from the team because the selectors wanted to give young cricketers a chance to be the first wicket-keeper
 vah is test match main bataur wicketiper-ballebaaj maidan par utre the
 In this way, the status of India's first wicket-keeper in the Test was also named after these boatmen
 bataur wicketiper bharat kii ore se pehla shikaar karne kaa shrey bhi naawale ke hi naam he
 In the first innings, he caught the opposition captain Douglas Jardine (79) and walked the pavilion
 naawale ke lihaaj yah match kai myanon main behad shandaar rahaa, lekin bharat yah match 158 ran se haar gaya Namaskar

" 'is yachika main aarope lagaaya gaya tha ki antar-mantri stareey samiti kii siforeeshon kaa ulanghan karke unke kshetra main mobile tower lagaaya ja rahaa he
 Dismissing the petition, Justice RS Endlaw advised the residents of Pocket-4 of Vasant Kunj to use mobile phones if they are against the installation of mobile towers in their area and are concerned about harmful radiation from mobile towers

 rahul ne twit kar kaha he kibijepisanvidhan kaa majaak uda rahi he, wo karnataka main bagaiyr bahumat ke sarkaar banani chaahati he
 This morning, as the BJP celebrates its hollow victory, the country is mourning the defeat of democracy
 karnataka main bijepi dwaara bahumat ke bagaiyr sarkaar banane kii koshish samvidhan kaa majaak udaana he
 Let us know that BJP leader BS Yeddyurappa has sworn in as the Chief Minister of Karnataka for the third time in Karnataka
 yediurppa ko 15 din main bahumat sabit karnaa hoga
 However, the Supreme Court has given relief to the BJP on the petition of the Congress that reached the Supreme Court on Wednesday night
 court ne yediurppa ke shapath grahan par roak lagane se inkaar kar diya
 Rajya Sabha MP Rajiv Chandrasekhar has introduced a private member bill to declare Pakistan a terrorist nation
 bill kaa naam aatankwaad praayojak desh kii ghoshnaa vidheyak (2016) he
 Not only this, Chandrasekhar has also demanded the withdrawal of the status of Most Favored Nation from Pakistan
 rajeev chandrashekhar ne kaha, 'maine pakistan ko aatanki raashtra ghoshit karne ke liye rajya sabha main privet member bill pesh kiya he
 Most Faber Nation status should be scrapped, moving towards alternatives like economic sanctions
 ' uri aatanki hamale ke baad chandrashekhar ne sansad ke bajet satr main is prastaav ko rakhaa gaya
 Before introducing the bill, Chandrasekhar said, "now the time has come for Parliament to approve a bill in which countries supporting terrorism are declared as terrorist nations"
 unhone kaha ki aisa isliye jaruri he kyonki ab antarrashtriya samudaay bhi pakistan ke aatank samarthit agenda ke khilaaf he
 The MP said that if Pakistan continues to promote terrorism, more stringent steps should be taken other than the military option
 is bill par charchaa hogi or uske baad sarkaar is par jawaab degi
 4 by Rajiv Chandrasekhar
 30 baje rajya sabha main privet member bill pesh kiya, jis par charchaa shuru ho gai
 It is a midnight incident on 6 February
 purvi champaran jile kii police ne teji se bhaag rahi honda city car ko pakadaa, jisamen 23 carton avaidh sharaab le jaai ja rahi thi
 Another vehicle running with it ran swiftly, crushing a police constable
 consteble kii maut ho gai
 Dinesh Kumar Sinha is the second policeman killed by liquor smugglers in the last two months
 iske pehle 27 november, 2017 ko patna ke uttar main samastipur jile main taskaron ke saath encounter main police sargent anil kumaar singh kii maut ho gai or sariranjan thanadhyaksh manoj kumaar singh goli lagane se ghayal ho gaye
 After this, on February 14, the smuggler Munna Nonia, who was trying to enter the Katihar district with a consignment of liquor, was hit by a police bullet
 april 2006 se hi, jab mukhyamantri nitish kumaar nebiharmen purna sharabbandi lagu kii thi, rajya police or aabkaari vibhaag taskari kii baadh se nipatane ke liye jujh rahe hai
 It has also had some success
 ab tak kareeb 250 karod ru
 22 of value
 5 lakh bottle sharaab jabt kii gai he
 Despite the scarcity of resources, the authorities have conducted 6 lakh raids in the last 22 months and 1
 08 lakh logon ko giraftaar kiya gaya he
 This is an average of 900 raids and 161 arrests per day
 haalanki yah bhi paryaapt nahin lagata
 According to critics, this is a futile exercise and Bihar is paying its price
 sharabbandi se pehle saal 2015-16 main rajya sarkaar ko 3,981 karod ru
 Excise revenue of Rs
 30,875 crore was collected from Bihar's total annual revenue
 kaa kareeb 13 fisadi he
 Although the Chief Minister counts its benefits, "forget the revenue loss, alcohol has brought positive changes in society, the health and economic condition of the poor is improving
" ’’lekin rashtriya janata dal ke mukhiya lalu prasad kehete hai ki sharabbandi naakaam he
 He alleges, "alcohol is delivered to the door of the people who have a crush
" jinaki kuvat nahin he, ve nakli sharaab pi rahe hai
 There is some truth in Lalu's claim
 kuch maheene pehle hi aktubar 2017 main rohtas jile main nakli sharaab pine se chaar logon kii maut ho gai thi
 District police officers acknowledge that liquor prohibition has given a boost to the black market
 ek jile ke espi kehete hai, ‘‘paidal sharaab taskari karne vaala ek vyakti maheene main 40,000 se 50,000 ru
 And he is willing to take any risk, even killing the policemen
 jabaki bihar sharabbandi kanoon main aise jimmedaar logon kii maut kii sajaa tak dene kii baat he, jahaan nakli sharaab pine se mautein hoti hon
 This is a big challenge
 police or aabkaari vibhaag ko har disha se aa rahe taskaron se nipatna hota he
 Bihar is bordered not only by UP, Jharkhand, West Bengal where liquor is legal, but to its north is the 1,751 km long open Nepal border
 salanaa swasthya survey (eeches) 2010-11 ke anusaar, sabhi bihari logon main se kareeb 9
 5 per cent means that about 44 lakh people drink alcohol
 isse agar april, 2016 main sthapit nashamukthi kendron tak pahunche mahaj 10,000 logon kii tulana karen to yah baat aasaani se samaj main aa jaati he ki bihariyon ne yah aadat chodi nahin he
 Take a look: Last month, the police arrested Nishikant, a deputy collector in Muzaffarpur, in a drunken state
 november maheene main purvi champaran main offis main sharaab pite do sarkari karmchaaree girakrataar kiye gaye the
 Four police constables were caught drinking in a police post in Bhagalpur
 haalanki, nitish kumaar is halaat ko badalane kaa iraadaa rakhte hai
 He has created the post of IG (liquor ban) in the state and is now making an intelligence wing with 250 personnel and making arrangements to keep an eye on tainted people within the administration
 lekin kya nayaa dakratar bihar main bah rahi avaidh sharaab par kaabo karne main sakasham ho paaegaa?
