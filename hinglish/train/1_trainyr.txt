 modi sarkaar ke do saal puraa hone ke mauqe par congress ji jaan se sarkaar ko gherne main lagi he
 Major party leaders are holding a press conference on this occasion with figures and allegations
 lekin hairaani kii baat he ki congress jis rahul gandhi ke chehre ke saath modi sarkaar ko takkar dene kii koshish main he use is mauqe par peeche rakhe hue he
 It is not that Rahul is abroad for summer vacation
 ve desh main or dilli main hi hai
 On Saturday, he will also lead a torch procession organized by the Delhi Pradesh Congress on the issue of electricity water crisis
 sawaal he ki party unka istemaal modi sarkaar par hamalaa bolne ke liye kyon nahin kar rahi
 While other party leaders have been engaged in this work
 isamen shaq nahin ki congress main kai bade netaa hai lekin modi sarkaar par hamale kii kaman agar rahul sambhalate to kya uskaa asar zyaada nahin hota? Moreover, the Twitter handle of Rahul Gandhi's office tweeting on almost every issue is silent on this issue
 party netaaon ke bayanon se itar modi sarkaar kii vifaltaaon par rahul ne apane daphtar ke twitor ke zarie bhi kuch nahin bolaa he
 However, his tweets are constantly coming on other issues
 isamen jayalalita se lekar mamata tak ko badhai ke twit shaamil hai
 The comments kya ye mahaz sanyog he yaa phir iske peeche koi sochi samajhi ranneeti? akhir kyon congress modi sarkaar par hamale se rahul ko filhal ek bayaan se bhi dur rakhe hue he jabaki kejariwal sarkaar ke kilaaf ve sadak par utarane ja rahe hai
 Prashant Kishore, who became the new campaign strategist in the Congress, has made headlines by quoting that Rahul Gandhi can be made the face of UP
 haalanki ki party kii taraf se isaki naa to aadhikarik taur par pushti hui or naa hi khandan
 So does Rahul want to be seen doing the politics of giving preference to local issues by raising the problem of water and electricity on the streets of Delhi
 wo bhi tab jab unako isi saal party adhyaksh banaae jane kii baat kai netaa kar chuke hai
 Raising local issues is not a wrong or trivial matter, but when the entire party is fighting against the Modi government, then the second largest leader after Sonia to stay away from it has also left many party leaders and workers
 bijepi adhyaksh amit shah samet tamaam bade netaaon ke saath saath modi sarkaar ke sabhi mantri bhi jab desh bhar main apni uplabdhiyon kaa bakhaan kar rahe hon aise main rahul kii chuppi kaa matlab unke nazadiqi salaahkaar hi bataa sakate hai

 Is this a mere coincidence or is there a thoughtful strategy behind it? After all, why is the Congress keeping Rahul away from a statement at the moment on the attack on the Modi government, while he is going on the road against the Kejriwal government
 congress main prachaar ke nae ranneetikaar bane prashanth kishor ke hawaale se ye khabar surkhiyaan bator chuki he ki rahul gandhi ko upi kaa cheharaa banaaya ja saktaa he

 The next hearing of this case will be on 26 August
 amit shah ke alaava is maamle ke sabhi aropiyon ko pesh hone kaa aadesh diya he
 Remember that BJP president Amit Shah Sohrabuddin and Tulsi Prajapati are still on bail in fake encounter cases
 supreme court ne donon mukademon ko jod diya he
 a lower court hearing him in Mumbai had earlier exempted Shah from appearing in the court
 gauratlab he ki loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi kii shandaar jeet ke peeche amit shah ko kaaphi shrey diya gaya, jiske baad unhen party kaa adhyaksh bana diya gaya
 Recently, Prime Minister Narendra Modi called him the 'man of the match' of the election
 kya he tulsi prajapati maamlagauratlab he ki tulsi prajapati kii 28 disambar 2006 ko police castady main hatya kar di gai thi
 It is alleged that he was confronted by the Gujarat Police
 is aparaadh main diaiji diji vanjaaraa va anya aaropee saat saal tak jail main rahe
 In 2012, the case became more discussed when the CBI in its charge sheet named the then Gujarat Home Minister Amit Shah as the prime accused in the case
 oktober 2012 main amit shah giraftaar kar liye gaye
 Earlier, 32 police officers along with IPS Vanzara were arrested for more than one case of fake encounter
 sibiai ke mutabik, prajapati 2005 ke soharabuddin shaikh encounter maamle kaa gavaah tha or isi vajah se uski hatya kii gai
 Amit Shah Sohrabuddin Sheikh is also an accused in the fake encounter case
 rajdhani dilli main sthit bhartiya praudyogiki santhaan (IIT) main ek chaatr dwaara hostel main khudakushi kaa sansanikhej maamla saamne aayaa he
 Police said that on Friday morning, the student's body was found hanging from the pajamas in his room in the hostel
 police ko chaatr ke kamare se ek suicide note bhi baraamad hua he
 According to the police, the suicide note is in Bangla language
 police ke mutabik, suicide note main chaunkaane vaala khulaasa hua he, jise padhakar police ke bhi hosh ud gaye
 According to the suicide note, the student was sexually abused since childhood, due to which he was very upset
 shuukravaar kii subah kareeb 8 baje vasant vihaar thane main phone aayaa ki IIT ke ek hostel main ek chaatr ne faansee lagaakar khudakushi kar lee he
 Police said the deceased student was in msc First Year
 do maheene pehle hi usne iaiti main admician liya tha
 As soon as the information was received, the police team reached the spot
 police ne jab kamare kii chaanbin kii to use chaatr ke bed ke paas teble se ekasuicide notemila
 When the police spoke to the student's family, it was found that on April 10, the student also tried to commit suicide by eating some pills
 haalanki tab kisi tarah chaatr kii jaan batch gai thi
 Since then the student was kept by the elder brother and he was also counseling him continuously
 beete guuruuvaar ko bade bhai chaatr ko hostel pahunchaaya tha
 But the very next day, he committed suicide in the hostel room by committing suicide
 dilli police ne suicide note ko jaanch ke liye forencik lab bhej diya he
 Police has also sent some copies of the student along with the suicide note
 iske alaava police ne suicide note main darj puri jaankaree bengal police ke saath share kii hai
 Delhi Police says that the sexual exploitation with the student took place in West Bengal itself
 chaatr mul rup se pashchim bengal ke hubli kaa rahane vaala he or kolkata ke ek bade college se usne bie kii shiksha puri kii
 After completing his BA, he got admission in Delhi IIT
 police ne bataaya ki ve is cese kii har egal se jaanch kar rahe hai or jaanch main bengal police kii bhi madad le rahe hai
 So far, no complaint has been lodged by the student's family, so no FIR has been filed yet
 philhal police postmortem report kaa intjaar kar rahi he
 The government has already brought to the notice (although a formal announcement is yet to be made) that the two Houses of Parliament will meet again from January 31 to February 13 to carry out the financial proceedings related to passing the 'vote on Account'
 is loksabhaa kaa yah antim satr hoga
 First, we were allowed to understand that the winter session would be extended and a meeting would be held again for Vote on Account
 lekin ab sarkaar ne sansad satr ko 'samaapt' kiye bina use khatm kar diya, or 31 janvari se nayaa satr aahut kiya jayega
 This will give the government the right to address the joint session of the two houses by the President, as it will be called the first session of this year
 isi kadam se sarkaar ko raashtrapati kii jubaan se nae sire se prachaar karwaane kaa bhi mauka mil jayega
 However, he will be invited to address another joint session this year after the general election 2019, when the new Lok Sabha will be formed
 ateet main bhi raashtrapati inhen halaat main ek hi saal me do-do sanyukt satron ko sambodhit kar chuke hai
 But the analyst is puzzled as to why a two-week session of work has been called for by the general to pass the Vote on Account, when it could have been settled in two days in both houses
 zaahir he, sarkaar kaa aisa koi iraadaa he, jo hamaari jaankaree main nahin he, or ek baar phir vipaksh bhounchakka rah jane vaala he, jaisaa haal hi main aarakshan bill ke mudde par hua tha
 Till some time back in the media, the market of rumors was hot that Modi government could present the entire budget in complete violation of the established tradition, as it has done with other established traditions of Parliament many times before
 ek hindi dainik, jo kadaachit sarkaar ke kaaphi kareeb he, ne sanket die hai ki sarkaar to aarthik surveykshan pesh karne kii bhi yojana bana rahi he
 Opposition parties have to be ready
 naagarikta (sanshodhan) vidheyak sareekha koi bhi vidhaayi kaamkaaj vichaar-vimarsh tathaa paarit karwaane ke liye rajyasabha ke samaksh prastut nahin kiya janaa chahie
 In fact, no new and serious work should be presented in this session of Parliament, and in this session only the vote of thanks and the President's address should be passed and a 'vote of thanks' should be passed
 iske liye ek saptaah kaa satr hi kaaphi hota, lekin zaahir he, sarkaar kaa iraadaa kuch or he
 Presentation of the entire budget should be stopped at all costs
 jaati hui loksabhaa ke paas agle saal ke liye sampoorn bajet par charchaa kar use paarit karne kaa haq nahin hota
 He does not have the mandate to do so
 aisa kiya janaa samvidhan tathaa sthapit paramparaon kaa bhi puri tarah ulanghan karnaa hoga
 Article 116 of the Indian Constitution describes the procedure of Vote on Account
 isamen sansad dwaara vittvarsh ke ek hisse ke liye anumaanit kharch ko manzuri dene bhar kaa zikr he, or jo pichley anuchhedon main varnit prakriya dwaara sampoorn bajet ke paarit hone tak vaid rahegi
 Kaul and Shakadhar also write clearly that the account of expenditure will be given in the Vote on Account, no proposal for a 'new service' can be included in it
 parampara ke mutabik, lekhanudaan se pehle aarthik surveykshan bhi prastut nahin kiya jayega, na usamen karon (taxeshan) main, visheshkar pratyaksh karon main, kisi tarah kaa badlaav kiya jayega, jinase vitt vidheyak main sanshodhan karnaa pade
 The Vote on Account shall contain only the details of expenditure for the year, with no new service, and for a part of the financial year from Parliament, which may be two months and even three months, to approve the expenditure incurred by the Government
 Will be asked for yah loksabhaa chunaav ke baad sthapit hone vaali nai sarkaar kaa adhikaar he ki vah sansad ke saamne sampoorn bajet prastut kare, apane kaarykaal ke ant main pahunch chuki sarkaar kaa nahin
 It is a provision of the constitution, it is a well established tradition, so anything done outside of it should be considered a violation of the constitution
 kaul tathaa shakdhar yah bhi suzav dete hai ki lekhanudaan, jo sirf do maheene ke liye hoga, par sansad main vichaar kiye jane kii bhi zarurat nahin
 But even though there is no restriction on such discussion, the truth cannot be changed that it will be just routine functioning
 is parampara ko badalane ke kisi bhi prayaas kaa kadaa virodh karnaa hoga
 Media reports indicate that various schemes with which the government can come up in the interim budget or even before, include the income scheme for the poor
 main is yojana ke khilaaf nahin hum
 i myself had suggested a similar scheme for farmers some time ago, but the time of this government is now over
 ise is vakt is tarah kii yojana pesh karne kaa koi adhikaar nahin he
 The opposition will have to be vigilant
 use sarkaar ke saamne us tarah samarpan nahin kar dena chahie, jis tarah usne saamaanya varg ke aarthik rup se kamazor logon ke liye laae gaye samvidhan sanshodhan bill ke samay kiya tha
 This step will not benefit anyone, and it is a fraud with the Constitution, but they gave the government a walkover in Parliament, which is now taking full advantage of it among the public
 media dabbu he, or sarkaar ke saath chal rahaa he, isliye jald hi hone ja rahe chunaav tak janata ko bevakoof bananaa mushkil nahin he
 By the time the public realizes that this step was too stupid like demonetisation, it will be too late
 cricket kii bhashaa main baat karen, to sarkaar ke paas shuruaati overon main ran banane ke sabhi maukey maujuud the
 At that time the government did not score runs
 ab, aakhri over main vah sirf chakke lagaakar 40 ran bananaa chaah rahi he
 Can they guess this, can anyone guess
 lekin agar duusari team, yani vipaksh, ne laaparvaahee se khelaa or no-bolein phenkin, jaisaa ve ateet main karte rahe hai, to sarkaar ke liye vah bhi mumkin he
 However, during this period, the Index of Industrial Production (IIP) dipped to 0 in November
 5 fisadi par pahunch gaya he, notebandi ke baad berojgaare chaar varsh ke ucchtam str par he, isi ke parinamswaroop udyog nishchit rup se dhime pad gaye hai, or 2018 main ek karod 10 lakh naukariyaan ghat gai hai

 worldcup 2019 khatm ho chukaa he, cricket kaa janak england vishwa vijeta bana he
 There is also a lot of debate about the final match, but a picture has settled in everyone's heart-o-mind among them all
 wo tasviir he final muqabla haarane ke baad bhi newjiland ke captain ken williamson ke chehre par muskuraahat
 Williamson's simplicity has won everyone's heart, neither anger, nor being part of the debate
 
 Even after the defeat of the World Cup, he just kept smiling like any other day
 ken williamson ko is baar worldcup kaa player of da toornament bhi chunaa gaya he
 With his batting, he overcame New Zealand on a number of occasions, while remaining calm in every situation, and captained him brilliantly
 yahi kaaran rahaa ki lagaataar duusari baar kiwi team worldcup ke final main pahunchin
 After losing the final match, Kane Williamson was asked about the throw which was run by Ben Stokes with 6 runs, he said that it was bad and embarrassing too, i hope it will never happen again
 Will happen
 haalanki, isi ke saath unhone ye bhi kaha ki ye usee khel kaa hissaa he, jise ham khelte hai isliye ise sweekaar karnaa hoga
 Kane Williamson's batting as well as his captaincy in this entire World Cup were highly praised
 kiviyon ne apane safar kii shuruyaat lagaataar jeet ke saath kii, phir thodaa ladkadaae haalanki, kismat ke dam par semifinal main pahunche
 India later beat India in the semi-finals, not even exceeding the target of 240 runs
 or phir final main bhi england ko bhi 241 ran kaa lakshya paar karne main nako chane chabava die
 In this entire World Cup, Ken Williamson scored 82 in 9 innings
 57 kii ausat se 578 ran banaae, jisamen 2 shatak or 2 ardhashatak shaamil rahe
 When the Indian fans' team of Dilnew Zealand defeated India in the semi-finals, 135 crore Indians lost their dream of winning the World Cup
 uske baad bhi ken williamson ne bhartiya phens se ek apil kii thi, jisane har kisi kaa dil jeet liya tha
 He had said that i hope that Indian fans will not be angry with him after this match, i would like to pray 135 crore people with us in the final
 bataa den ki ipel main williamson sunrisers hyderabad kii captaini karte hai, aise main bharat main bhi unke phens kii kami nahin he
 Kameken, who has won in the past, has another anecdote related to Williamson, which is always remembered
 2014 main newjiland or pakistan ke bich vanade series hui thi, jise newjiland ne 3-2 se jeeta tha
 But at the same time there was a terrorist attack in Peshawar, in which many school children lost their lives
 tab ken williamson ne apane paanchon match kii fees ghayal bacchon ke ilaaj main istemaal kiye jane vaale fund main di
 Did you know: After New Zealand won one-day series against Pakistan (3-2) in 2014, Kane Williamson donated all his match fees (all five games) and more to affected families of the deadly Peshawar attack on school children
 That’s how great this man is! # yeswekane # Kiwispic

 Read: 'devil' of 'kick' created a boom at the box office, breaking record photos australia ke harfanmaulaa khilaadi marcus stoinis buudhvaar ko pakistan ke khilaaf hone vaale match main nahin khelenge
 He has been ruled out of the match due to a side strain
 website iespncricainfo kii report ke mutabik, stoinis ke puure toornament main khilne kii bhi sambhaavnaaen hai
 For this reason, Mitchell Marsh, who is going to tour England from australia-a team, has been called as a cover for Stoinis
 stoinis par antim faisla shanivaar ko srilanka ke khilaaf hone vaale match se pehle liya jayega
 He will be examined before the match and then it will be known whether Stoinis will play in this World Cup
 ek mushkil baat stoinis kab tak baahar hai, is baat kaa pataa lagaana he
 According to the World Cup rules, if the name of a player's option is approved, the change can be made only when another player is injured
 ab australia ko yah faisla lenaa hoga ki kya wo stoinis ke bina unke thik hone tak khel sakati he yaa nahin
 Pakistan's eyes After winning by seven wickets at the hands of the West Indies in the first match, Pakistan bounced back in style and defeated a strong team like England in their second match
 uskaa teesraa match radd ho gaya tha
 Now in their next match of the ICC World Cup-2019, on Wednesday, the challenge of the current winner Australia will be against Pakistan
 australia jakhmi sher kii tarahaustralia ko apane pichley match main bharat ne haraaya he
 She is now ambushed against Pakistan like a wounded lion
 pakistan kaa yah chauthaa match he
 He was to face Sri Lanka in the third match but that match was washed out due to rain
 pakistan kii koshish hogi ki vah usee jujharupan or junun se khele jaise ve england ke khilaaf kheli thi
 The good thing in that match was that the team's batting was excellent
 imam ul haq or fakhar jaman ne team ko behtareen shuruyaat di thi or bade score kii neenv rakhi thi
 After this, Mohammad Hafeez and Babar Azam led the team to a big score in which captain Sarfraz Ahmed also contributed half-century
 australia ke saamne bhi use isi tarah kii ballebaaji kerani hogi, lekin saath hi mishael stark, pat kamins, nathan kalter nile kii tigadi kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 However, Australia's problems may increase after Stoinis is left out of the team

 bharat or pakistan ke bich niyantran rekha kaa ilaaka saal ke zyaadaatar vakt behad durgam hota he
 But no threat, the threat of the mountain peaks, passes and tight valleys of this disputed border area of 740 km, can counter the fear that the Indian Army calls 'bat Gardi'

 sansadeey sachiv maamle main chunaav ayog dwaara aam aadmi party ke 20 vidhayakon ko ayogy tehraane ke faisle ko prashanth bhushan ne sahi tehraaya he
 Speaking specifically to 'aaj Tak', Prashant Bhushan said that the decision to appoint Parliamentary Secretary was wrong
 chunaav ayog bhale nishpaksh na ho or bijepi kii tarafdaari karata ho, lekin chunaav ayog kaa yah faisla galat nahin he
 Prashant Bhushan, while explaining the law of office of profit, said that the law of office of profit was made because the mps are independent of the government
 prashanth bhooshnaka kahana he ki kanoon ke mutabik sarkaar main mantri pad 10% se zyada nahin ho sakate hai, lekin aam aadmi party ne 7 mantriyon ke saath teen-teen sansadeey sachiv niyukt kar die jo dipti ministar kii tarah hote hai
 On the question of getting relief from the High Court or the Supreme Court to the Aam Aadmi Party, Prashant Bhushan said that the mlas may not be given salary by giving powers to the parliamentary secretaries, but the office was given
 hoicourt main gambhirtha se sunwaayee jaruri hogi, lekin meri raay main hoicourt chunaav ayog ko sahi tehraayega or agar supreme court bhi jate hai to mujhe nahin lagata ki aam aadmi party ko koi raahat milegi
 i think there will be a re-election of 20 seats in the coming time
 baatcheet ke dauraan prashanth bhushan neam aadmi partiki badi galtiyaan bhi ginaayin
 He told that “aam Aadmi Party has committed a lot of mistakes
 party ne aise ummidavaaron ko chun liya jinaki aapraadhik chhavi thi
 The party had said that the vehicles would not take the bungalow, reduce the salary, put the information of donations in the website, but left everything
 na internal lokapal he, na lokapal kaa kanoon he
 Similarly, the decision of the Parliamentary Secretary was also taken which shows that they have forgotten the principles on which the party was formed
 aam aadmi party kii sadsyta radd karne ke faisle par agar raashtrapati mohar laga dete hai to dilli main ek baar phir upachunaav kii sthiti ban sakati he
 Prashant Bhushan was asked the question, how many seats out of 20 can AAP get after 3 years? On this, he said that the Aam Aadmi Party moves from one mess to another
 ab jab chunaav honge to party ko dikkat jhelni padegi
 In my opinion, less than 10 out of 20 seats will come

 Moazzam Mohammad forty-six-year-old Asha Parveen is in the crowded BJP headquarters in Srinagar
 narbal gaanv kii is sarpanch ne beete sitambar main congress chhodkar bhagava party kaa daaman thama he
 She is currently staying in a private hotel in Badamibagh Cantonment area of srinagar
 parveen bataati hai ki beete disambar main hue panchayat chunaav ke baad se hi ve apane gaanv zyada nahin gai hai kyonki unhen mili suraksha waapas le lee gai thi
 Parveen, who has been active in politics for 25 years, has had two terrorist attacks in the past
 unka kahana he ki unki suraksha main lagaae gaye do surakshakarmiyon ko waapas le liye jane ke baad unka jivan khatre main tha
 Parveen, who had been the Women's Congress President of Budgam, was also stripped of 'pravasi' status, giving her family Rs 9,000
 kaa masik bhatta or rashan kaa adhikaar khatm ho gaya tha
 (this is found by those who fled their homes after the rise of insurgency in 1989)
 lekin ve khule taur par sweekaar karti hai ki nishtha badalane ke baad unki suraksha or 'pravasi' kaa darja behaal ho jaaenge
 She says with a smile, "congress and National Conference have been eliminated
 yahaan bhaajapa main logon kaa kaam ho jayega, or meraa kaam bhi ho jayega
 Parveen is part of the electoral college of panchs and sarpanches that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) depends on for the October 24 (second level of panchayati raj system) block development council (BDC) elections
 inhen ke jariye party ghati kii sthaneey shashan vyavastha par niyantran hasil karnaa chaahati he
 At present, the party has fielded 120 candidates in 134 such blocks, where it has never won parliamentary or assembly elections before
 jammu-kashmir ke 317 block main in chunaavon ke liye 1,065 namakan hue hai (ghati main 396 or baaki jammu tathaa ladakh se)
 According to the data available in the office of the Chief Electoral Officer of Jammu and Kashmir, 27 of these presidents have been elected unopposed, of which 15 belong to the BJP
 udhaaharan ke liye dakshin kashmir ke shopiyaan jile ke 10 block main se keval do block main chunaav honge kyonki vahaan ke chah block se bhaajapa ke pratyaashee nirvirodh nirvaachit ho chuke hai
 In a block there, the post of president was reserved for women, but no nomination was filled
 pichley saal disambar main hue panchayat chunaavon kii tarah hi is baar bhi koi vipakshi dal chunaav nahin lard rahaa he
 According to data from the Jammu and Kashmir Election Office, 12,054 posts of panches and sarpanches (61 per cent of the total posts) were left vacant in the districts of the valley, apart from low turnout in that election
 chunaavon main 699 panchayat halkon (ek gaanv yaa kuch gaanvon se bana kshetra) main matdaan hi nahin hua kyonki vahaan akelaa ummidavaar nirvirodh jeet gaya tha
 As expected, BJP emerged on top with 1,267 elected Panchs and Sarpanches in that election
 bhaajapa ke pravaktaa or traal gaanv ke sarpanch altaaf thakur kaa kahana he ki pichley kuch maheenon main anya 300 se adhik panchon tathaa sarpanchon ko party main shaamil kiya gaya he jisase party se jude panchon yaa sarpanchon kii sankhya ab 1,500 se adhik ho gai he
 Major political parties like National Conference (NC), Jammu and Kashmir People's Democratic Party (PDP) and Congress have boycotted the BDC elections as their leaders and activists have been in custody or under house arrest since August 5
 isamen teen purv mukhyamantri—faruk abdulla, umr abdulla or mahabuuba mufti—shaamil hai
 Retired Justice Hasnain Masudi, National Conference MP, says, "the whole electoral process is a false exercise
" loktantr main aisa kabhi nahin hua
 The BJP is being contested by separating all political parties from it
 
 
 yah chunaav nahin he, ise chayan kaha ja saktaa he
 But state BJP spokesperson Ashwini Chrungu disagrees
 ve kehete hai, ''inkaa (rajnatik dalon ke) duusare or tisare str kaa netritv he jo chunaav lard saktaa he
 Where are they? "chrungu, who described the panchayat elections as the first phase of the establishment of a new political system in Jammu and Kashmir, says," We will not allow those people to show off
 bidisi ke chunaav ke baad ham jila vikaas parishadon ke chunaavon ke bare main sochenge
 He says that panchayat elections are the first step towards establishing a new political system in Jammu and Kashmir
 jammu or kashmir ke sarkari amale kaa dhyaan bhi isi baat par kendrit he
 Unlike in the past, panches and sarpanches in the state have been strengthened by allocating funds with considerable authority under the arrangements of the Panchayati Raj Act
 isse yah dharna bani he ki apane nirvachan kshetron main pakad rakhane vaale purv vidhayakon ko nishprabhavi karne ke liye uske samanaantar ek shakti centre taiyaar kiya ja rahaa he
 a top bureaucrat from Jammu and Kashmir did not deny the fact behind the government's enthusiasm for strengthening local governance institutions
 lekin, gramin vikaas vibhaag or panchayat raaj ke sachiv sheethal nanda jor dekar kehete hai ki ve keval panchayat raaj adhinium ke praavdhaanon kaa paalan kar rahe hai
 So far, the government has released an installment of Rs 1,000 crore to 4,483 panchayats for public works and Rs 700 crore will be released soon
 iskaa matlab he ki ek panchayat apane gaanv main ausatan 30-50 lakh rupye kharch karegi
 Says Nanda, "this is not an option for the assembly, but they (panchayats) will be able to address local issues
" isiilie vikaas kaaryon kii nigaraanee or samanvay ke liye nirvaachit bidisi nikaay yahaan mahatvapurn he
 '' *** karnataka ke tumkur main congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi kii upasthiti vaale kaarykram main us samay halchal much gai, jab apane samudaay ko anusuchit jati kaa aarakshan dilwane kii maang kar rahi ek mahila ne samaaroh main kaala jhanda dikhaaya
 After this, the police took him out of there and beat him up
 sonia ne jaise hi siddhaganga math ke pramukh sivakumar swami kii 105veen saalagirah par yojit samaaroh main apana bhaashan shuru kiya, darshakon kii pankti main baithi is mahila ne ekaek khadey hokar unhen kaala jhanda dikhaaya

 So between them, instead of the bomb, an attempt is being made to initiate the matter
 magar kim jong un apni taraf se jang kii taiyaariyon main koi kor kasar nahin chhodana chahta he
 Talk of friendship, preparation of war, North Korea itself uploads its preparations on national television and on youtube and wants to tell South Korea and America that the drill of those two countries is nothing ahead of this drill
 bharose kii kami donon dhadon main is kadar he ki na kim ko america par yakeen he or na america ko kim ke vaadon par itminan

 bharat ne bangaleru test match main australian team ko 75 ranon se karaari shikast di
 In the 20th over of the Australian innings, Steve Smith off Umesh Yadav when LBW was appealed, and the umpire called out
 iske baad faisle ko rivyuu karne ke liye smith ne diares lene se pehle dressing room kii madad maangi
 On seeing this, Virat Kohli lodged an objection, Virat complained to the umpire about this
 jiske baad ampire ne smith ko roka or smith bina diares liye dressing room main laut gaye
 When Smith was lbw by fast bowler Umesh Yadav in the 21st over of the Australian innings, the visiting team players were in a dilemma as to whether or not to take DRS for Smith as a DRS had already been taken for David Warner, who was an Indian Was in favor of the team
 smith pehle naan-striker chor par mude taaki raay lee ja sake lekin chijen tab garm hone lageen jab ampire ne dekha ki yah ballebaaj dressing room kii ore bhi muda he

 He said, i saw twice while batting
 maine dekha ki unke khilaadi upar (dressing room) kii ore dekh rahe the
 i told the umpires that it should stop
 kohli ne kaha ki cricket maidan par niyamon ko aap laangh nahin sakate
 Spoiling is a different thing
 unhone jo kiya main us shabd kaa prayog nahin karnaa chahta
 i will never do this on the cricket field
 is dauraan ek patrkaar ne jab unase poocha ki kya yah shabd 'beyimaani' he to kohli ne hansi ke saath jawaab dete hue kaha ki main yah nahin kah saktaa, shaayad aap kah sakate hai
 He said that i do not want to say anything more on this issue

 chunavi funding vyavastha main sudhaar ke liye sarkaar ne pichley saal elactoral bond kii shuruyaat kii he
 The government introduced this bond with the claim that it would increase transparency in political funding and bring in clean money
 lekin hua iskaa ulta he
 Instead of bringing transparency, this bond has increased the risk, not only that there is scope for donations from foreign sources also
 gat 12 march ko supreme court ne is par naaraazgi jaahir kii thi ki centre sarkaar ne raajnneetigyon ke athaah dhan par ankush lagane ke liye koi sthaayee system nahin banaaya he, jabaki khud supreme court pichley saal iske bare main aadesh kar chukaa he
 In February 2018, the Supreme Court was stunned to find that the money of many mps-mlas and their relatives had increased by 500 per cent within two years ie within five years
 supreme court ne iske bare main gambhirtha se koi kadam uthaane kii jarurat bataai
 Despite this, the system of donations received by political parties has remained opaque for years and they do not have to give any account
 yah raajnneetigyon ke liye aasaan dhan kaa strot bana hua he
 Several petitions are pending in the Supreme Court and the Delhi High Court to ban such funding
 sarkaar ne raajnneetik dalon ko chande ke liye paardarshee vyavastha banane ke liye elactoral bearar bond kii shuruyaat kii he
 But this has given a boost to the corporate donations from political parties to 'unknown sources' and the donations from foreign sources have also become legal
 strot bataane kii jarurat nahinelactoral bond kii shuruyaat karte samay ise sahi tehraate hue vitt mantri arun jetali ne janvari 2018 main likhaa tha, 'elactoral bond kii yojana raajnneetik funding kii vyavastha main 'saaf-suthra' dhan laane or 'paardarshita' badhaane ke liye laai gai he
 'but what really happened is exactly the opposite
 elactoral bond finance act 2017 ke dwaara laae gaye the
 In fact, they increase the risk on transparency
 khud chunaav ayog ne in badlaavon par gahari aapatti karte hue kanoon mantralay ko inamen badlaav ke liye letters likhaa he
 Changing section 29C of the Representation of the People Act (RP Act) states that funds received by electoral bonds will be kept out of the scrutiny of the Election Commission
 chunaav ayog ne ise pratigaami kadam bataaya he
 The Election Commission said that it would also not be able to know whether any political party is taking donations from government companies from foreign sources, which has been banned under Section 29B
 isi prakaar arapy act kii dhara 29 si ke tahat ab bhi 20,000 rupee tak kaa chanda bina kisi hisaab-kitaab ke liya ja saktaa he
 So there is no impact on accountability or transparency in political donations
 shell companiyon ko milegaa badhaava!tisare, company act 2013 main kaha gaya tha ki koi company ek vittiya varsh main pichley teen saal ke apane ausat net profit ke 7
 Can not provide political donations of more than 5 percent
 lekin isamen badlaav karte hue ab 'kitni bhi raashi' dene kii chhot de di gai he
 Not only this, companies are also exempted from hiding which party they have donated in their books
 chunaav ayog ne is sabhi badlaavon par aapatti kii he
 This has increased the risk that shell companies should be formed only to fund political parties
 pichley varshon main chunaav ayog ne kai baar press conference kar or letters likhakar saarvajanik taur par in badlaavon par aapatti jataai he, lekin sarkaar kuch badalane ko taiyaar nahin he
 The government says that contributions to the electoral bonds will be made by 'payee check of a bank or electronic clearing system from a bank account'
 sarkaar ne janvari 2018 main elactoral bond ke notification jari karte samay yah bhi saaf kiya tha ki ise kharidne vaale ko puri tarah se kevaisi norm puraa karnaa hoga or bank khate ke dwaara bhugtan karnaa hoga
 These bonds are given a random serial number which is not normally seen by the eye
 bond jari karne vaala esbiai is serial number ke bare main kisi ko nahin bataata
 But all the above provisions also do not remove the problems
 chanda dene vaali kii gopneeyata or raajnneetik funding main apaardarshita bani rahati he or yah sab chunaav ayog kii jaanch ke daayre se bhi baahar he
 Even after KY, only the bank or the government can know about the donor, not the Election Commission or any common citizen
 satta paksh ko phaaydachunaav sudhaaron par kaam karne vaale association for democratic riforms (ADR) kaa kahana he ki elactoral bond se vastav main satta paksh ko phayda ho rahaa he
 According to the ADR, in the year 2017-18, Rs 222 crore was donated by electoral bonds
 isamen se bijepi ko 210 karod (94
 5%), Congress got Rs 5 crore and the remaining parties got Rs 7 crore

 Love you all! a post shared byjanhvi Kapoor (@janhvikapoor) onmar 5, 2019 at 10:08 pm PST During an interview, Jahnavi Kapoor shared her feelings about Anshula and Khushi
 unhone kaha tha ki vah anshula or khushi kapur ke saath apane relationships ko shabdon main vyakt nahin kar sakati he
 These days, Jahnavi Kapoor is shooting for Kargil Girl in Lucknow
 yah unki duusari film he
 Earlier, she was seen in Dhadak
 bataate chalem ki aieef payalat gunjan saxena par ban rahi byopic 'kargil girl' main jahnavi kapur lead role play kar rahi hai
 Pilot Gunjan Saxena had done the work of rescuing the injured soldiers from Kargil in 1999
 iske alaava gunjan desh kii pehali mahila hai, jinhen shaury chakra aword se sammanit kiya gaya tha
 The script of Kishore continues in a five-star hotel a few kilometers away
 haalanki kishor ne jinhen manaakar yaa dabaav banaakar jo list taiyaar kii he, usamen priyanka gandhi wadra ke kaam kaa vivaran abhi tak shaamil nahin he
 There are only a few people who feel that Kishore was not behind Priyanka Gandhi's claim of Chief Ministerial post in June
 agar yah party par ek dawaab daalane vaali ranneeti thi to bhi isane ulataa asar kiya
 True or false, whatever the information was, the Congress was greatly irritated by the leaking of this news and in return it was found to be saying that Priyanka is neither the face of the election campaign nor was there any way of Priyanka outside Amethi and Rae Bareli
 There is no possibility of organizing a big rally
 kishor ke liye yah ek tarah se sanket tha ki vah apni seemaa main hi rahen
 But if they are close to him, Prashant is working on another plan in which he is going to make a big announcement with Rahul Gandhi
 (priyanka kii aguwai kii khabaron ko darkinar karte hue) rahul kii pramukhataa sthapit hone ke baad, priyanka kii upasthiti par kaam kiya jayega, badi-badi chunavi baithkon main nahin, balki chote str par 'janata se sanchaar sthapit karne vaale kaaryakramon' main unki maujuudagi hogi
 Much depends on his mother's health
 dopaher kareeb dhai baje kishor ke paas phone aata he ki shrimati gandhi kii tabiyat thik nahin he
 All the big Congress leaders were present in the city and there was also news that they had fever
 unhen kishor kii team ne bataaya ki vah car badal rahi hai or thodi hi der main phir dikhaai dengi, media se bhi yahi kaha gaya
 Those who were present with Sonia Gandhi were instructed that the Congress President should stop a little to talk to the public, save his strength a little and do not lean more outside the doors of Tata Safari, which he used to say in the areas of SPG Doing it in the open Mercedes is unsafe for them
 30 minute baad tivi channel ne shrimati gandhi ko ek musalmaan ilaake main vaapasi karte hue dekha
 Clouds have fallen
 gharon kii chhaton par bheed lagi he, sadaken samarthakon se labalab bhari hai
 Hours later, I-PAC assigns some of these selected scenes to the media, stating that the program was a success
 chunavi abhiyaan kaa yah gur kishor ne bijepi adhyaksh amit shah se kathith taur par siikhaa he
 a few weeks after the success of 2014, Kishore parted ways with the BJP after growing bitterness between the two
 is chust ranneetikaar ke aalochakon kii maane to matbhed se pehle bijepi netaaon ne kishor ko pradhanmantri kii jeet kaa kaaphi had tak shrey lene diya
 At the same time, many described him as a selfish person, who left the BJP and joined Nitish Kumar in 2015 to settle accounts with his old boss
 udhar kishor ke samarthakon kaa kahana he ki nazadiiki logon ke bich bhi prashanth kaaphi nape-tule andaaz main us vakt ko yaad karte hai or kehete hai ki pehle ke raajnneetik kaam kii charchaa karnaa zaraa shobhaa nahin detaa
 If you are close to BJP, Nitish Kumar and then Congress, Kishore, he is not a party to change the party without any ideology
 'acchhee shashan pranali or ek rajaneta jo yah sabit kar chukaa he ki vah kaam kar saktaa he
 Prashant supports any candidate on this basis
 ' - naam na bataae jane kii shart par kishor ke ek saathi ne yah jaankaree di (vaise kishor or unke doston, saathiyon or I-PAC karmchaariyon ke bich gopneeyata ek ahm dhaagaa he)
 One of his colleagues says' Look at Narendra Modi, Nitish, Sheela Dixit, even Amarinder Singh
 unhen lagata he ki yah sab achche prashaasak hai
 In a slightly informal environment, it is also reported that Kishore has on some occasions believed that the Congress is working harder than the strategy, a party whose failure behind the system is also largely responsible
 shaam saadhe chah baje, ek lambey chunavi road sho ke baad shrimati gandhi kii tabiyat ne jawaab de diya
 Reports about his health began to appear on the news channel, he was taken to the airport by drip, the air ambulance is being thought of, a local hospital is kept ready, the Prime Minister tweeted and expressed his concern is
 raat 10 baje unhen chartered plane se dilli bhej diya gaya
 The injury to his shoulder for several hours was not shown
 philhal vah aspataal main hi hai
 Meanwhile, in a corner of the lobby of the Taj Hotel, the teenagers seem to be immersed in some deep thinking
 piem ke khilaaf 2014 main khadey hone vaale congressi ajay raay unke kareeb aakar baith jate hai
 He is followed by a senior Congressman with a medical assistant who proposes to open the area's election office at his house in Ghazipur
 phir aana hota he ek or sthaneey rajaneta kaa, jo ek yuvak ko apane saath laae hai, jo chunaav ladanaa chahta he
 The leader says to Kishore 'if you say so
 
 
 ' kishor sir hilaa dete hai
 At dinner, Kishore has a vegetarian plate in front of him and is accompanied by a young police officer who has recently been appointed to a high position in Varanasi
 donon ne aapas main jaankaree saajha kii ki bheed sabase zyada kahaan thi, intazaam kis tarah ke the, log kya kah rahe the (is baat par donon ekamat the ki shrimati gandhi ke liye logon ke man main dayaa or chintaa thi)
 According to official estimates, 15 thousand people had gathered in the roadshow, which was less than the pm's visit to Varanasi, but in spite of this, it was a figure whose credit goes completely to the Congress
 prashanth jin par bharosa karte hai yaa kam se kam jinako lekar is had tak sunishchit rahete hai ki jarurat padane par ve unke vichaaron par bharosa karenge-aise logon ke samaksh kishor ne kaha he ki bhale hi vah chahen jaise bhi rajanetaaon se ghire hon lekin 2019 main upi unki bhoomika ko paribhaashit nahin karegaa
 Kishore reportedly said, "if i lose in Uttar Pradesh as everyone is saying, the game is over for me
" or agar main jeetta hum
 
 
 So what could be a bigger result than this? Winning UP elections will be bigger than a Lok Sabha election
 ' is baat kii tasdik kii ja sakati he
 After the air strike, the Congress and other parties kept silence for a while, but Mamata Banerjee raised her voice against the BJP
 vah lagaataar aisa gathbandhan banane kaa prayaas karti raheen jisase bijepi ko haraaya ja sake
 The Congress and Aam Aadmi Party's alliance in Delhi may not have been possible, but Mamta's effort has been that if the two parties fought together, it would have been easy to defeat the BJP
 trinmul congress supremeo centre kii bhartiya janata party (bijepi) sarkaar or pradhanmantri narendra modi ke khilaaf puure vipaksh ko ek saath saajha manch par laane ke liye kaam kar rahi hai
 In January, he organized a huge rally at the Brigade Grounds in Kolkata
 yahaan tak ki centre kii modi sarkaar se do-do haath karte hue sibiai kii karrwai ke khilaaf vah dharne par bhi baith gayi
 She thus emerged as the main leader uniting the opposition
 mamata banerjee ne ek baar phir dilli main aam aadmi party or congress ke bich gathbandhan karaane kii koshish kii
 However, she failed in this and the Congress announced to contest the Lok Sabha elections on its own in the national capital
 haalanki aisa nahin he ki congress ab kshetreey partiyon ke saath gathbandhan nahin karegi
 If regional parties join hands with the Congress, they can gain a lot
 bijepi ko bedakhal karne kii koshishbaharhaal, trinmul congress ke sutron ne bataaya ki mamata banerjee congress ko aam aadmi party ke saath gathbandhan ke liye puri tarah se sakriy thim or bijepi ko satta se dur rakhane ke liye chaahati thim ki dilli main yah gathbandhan thos aakaar le le
 She continued to talk to the Congress high command and the Aam Aadmi Party over the phone for this
 trinmul bijepi ko satta se bedakhal karne ke liye koi bhi mauka ganvaana nahin chaahati he
 Mamata Banerjee's effort is not limited to Arvind Kejriwal-led Aam Aadmi Party, but she is also trying to convince Sharad Pawar in Maharashtra and Chandra Babu Naidu in Andhra Pradesh
 root kii sabhi line vyast hanmamta banerjee gaiyr endie dalon ke pramukhon ko lagaataar phone kar rahi hai
 She is trying her best to persuade regional parties to reach a consensus on seat sharing
 unki koshish he ki partiyaan matbhed bhuulaakar ek saath aa jaaen taaki bijepi virdohi voton main bantwaare ko roka ja sake
 It is not easy for Mamata Banerjee to unite opposition parties
 haal ke dinon main bengal main makapa or congress netritv ke saath anya kshetreey partiyaan bhi apane-apane gadhon main seat bantwaare par samjhauta karne ko taiyaar nahin hai
 Although Mamata Banerjee and Arvind Kejriwal have a lot of synergy at the ideological level, as soon as Mamata dials the Congress number for the alliance, it goes into 'busy' mode

 Dustin Brown defeated Rafael Nadal 7-5, 3-6, 6-4, 6-4 in the second round match at Wimbledon and the German player became an overnight star in the world tennis circuit

 Tennis is not so popular in Jamaica, nor are there facilities associated with the sport
 magar is puure daur ne brown ko maansik rup se majboot banaaya
 In 2004, his family returned to Germany and his mother then presented him with a van that allowed Brown to travel across Europe and play tennis
 magar paise kii killat phir bhi rahi
 Brown sometimes rented his van and spent the night under the open sky

 Although he has become a star in the eyes of the world after defeating Rafael Nadal at Wimbledon, but few people know that in 2014, he has also defeated the gary-weber tournament on grass-court

 Amid the tussle over the alliance with the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the Congress has sought the opinion of the party's Delhi unit workers on the issue through an audio clip on its mobile app
 congress ke ek varisht netaa ne bataaya, ‘‘congress ne apane 'shakti ap' par dilli ke eisisi prabharee pisi chaako kii ek audio clip daali he, jisamen vah ‘aap' ke saath gathbandhan ke mudde par dilli ke congress kaaryakartaaon kii raay maang rahe hai
 He said that the survey started in this regard on the Shakti app started on Wednesday and it will end on Thursday
 congress ke sutron kaa kahana he ki ‘aap' ke saath gathbandhan ‘‘lagbhag tay'' he or is maheene ke ant tak ise antim rup de diya jayega
 (from input language) sawan kaa maheenaa chal rahaa he lekin dilli vaale barish kii rimjhim phuhaaron ko taras rahe hai
 Tempted by the heat and humidity, tourists are also cursing the weather of Delhi
 july kaa maheenaa lagbhag khatm hone ko hai lekin umas bhari chipchipi garmi or paseene se raahat ke asaar nahin dikh rahe
 The situation is such that people are eagerly waiting for the rain
 bangalore se dilli ghoomane pahunche sailaani dilli ke umas se kaaphi pareshaan hai
 So according to Udit, a student of DU, the desire to roam in the rain with friends is not complete
 jaraa si barish hone par log ghoomane kii yojana banaate hi hai ki tab tak dhoop nikal aati he
 Due to the heat, the entire plan is destroyed
 darasal maidani ilaakon main barish ke saath saath bich-bich main chatak dhoop khil rahi he
 The reason of this eye-twitching of sun and clouds remains sultry
 mausam vibhaag ke mutabik dilli ensiaar main agle 2-3 dinon ke tak umas kaa silsilaa jari rahegaa, lekin 30 july ke baad mausam karavat badalegaa
 delhi-ncr will receive good rainfall from 31 July and will continue till 2 August
 mausam visheshgy charan singh ke mutabik dilli ensiaar main abhi tak 32 se 35 mimi barish hui he
 While it was to be 19 to 20 mm
 is lihaaj se dilli- ensiaar main 75 fisad zyada barish ab tak record kii gai he
 According to the Meteorological Department, central and northwest India are receiving good rains
 pahaado main barish zyada ho rahi he maidaanon main thodi kam he
 Central India and Western India will still have 3-4 days of rain
 haalanki, isaki intencity samay ke saath dhire dhire kam ho jaaegi
 After this, activity will increase in North West India and the plains
 barish kii intencity bhi badhegi
 It will also have an impact in delhi-ncr
 31 july, 1 or 2 agast ko north west india sahit dilli ensiaar main acchhee barish hogi

 That is why he was also confident of his victory as he was confident in his unique steps like reducing electricity and water bills and Mohalla clinics
 lekin iske baavjood agar use in chunaavon main karaari haar mili to uske paryaapt kaaran hai
 No communication: There is no doubt that the Aam Aadmi Party has done remarkable work in the last two years on basic amenities like electricity, water, education and health, but in spite of this, if the people of Delhi are denying it then it is clear that the party Leaders have failed to convey the benefits of these works to the public
 ye sab tab hua jab party ne prachaar par baari bharkam kharch kiya
 Waidakhilafi: When the Aam Aadmi Party came to power, one of the major reasons was the populist promises made by the party but despite completing two years, the party could not move forward in fulfilling those promises
 mahila suraksha ke liye puri dilli main sisitivi lagavaana or rashtriya rajdhani ko wifai jone main tabdeel kar dena uske aise hi vaayade hai

 The economy is moving towards a structural change
 isliye aise main kisi bhi tarah kii bhavishyavaanee karnaa thodaa mushkil he
 He said that India's economy is also different like culture
 maang or supplai ke data ko dekhnaa hoga
 The differences are so much that it is very difficult to see any change on one scale
 macro-bijness se phayda hoga
 It is better to make more precise efforts that give benefit in the long run
 ham 5 trillian dollar iconomi ban sakate hai
 If the growth rate is 12 percent, then it is possible
 abhi ye sthiti nahin ban rahi lekin ban sakati he
 there is time
 mehnat kerani hogi
 Not all indigenous or foreign economists can be put in one bucket
 hamen sabko sunanaa hoga
 Raghuram is also right

 There are several reasons for GDP growth
 achaanak se growth nahin hogi
 Bad times have come but not so bad that we get sad
 log nivesh nahin kar rahe hai
 Because the requirements have reduced but it will be fixed later
 unhone kaha ki ye kahana galat nahin hoga ki desh kii arthvyavastha main kami ai he
 But this government has taken too much time to believe that there is a recession
 isse fark nahin padataa ki iconomic export kahaan se aayaa he
 Be it foreign or native

 For a $ 5 trillion economy, the country will have to raise the GDP growth rate
 ham ye kar sakate hai
 We can become such a big economy

 raghuram rajan ne ye kaise soch liya ki desh main arthvyavastha ke export nahin he
 Former Finance Minister Arun Jaitley demanded from RBI for five years to reduce the rate
 lekin aisa nahin hua
 Having more experts in the country also causes problems
 lekin desh main achche iconomic export hai
 The Finance Minister has taken a lot of steps
 sarkaar uthaa rahi he
 It would be wrong to say that the government is not trying
 chunaav ke saath iconomi par focus karne main thodi dikkat aati he
 The country will come out of the economic downturn, will have to be a little patient: Sameeran Chakraborty: Miraman Chakraborty said that if you see India's share in the world's exports, it has increased

 karishma kapur bijnesamansanjay kapoorsetalakalene ke baad akasar apane boyfriendsandiptoshnival ke saath najar ai hai
 This year also came the news that both are about to get married, but Karishma's father Randhir Kapoor denied these reports outright
 ab sanjay or karishma ke soshal sarkal main ye khabar tej he ki donon kaa brake ho gaya he
 According to Mumbai Mirror, Karishma is not interested in getting married for the second time
 ve ab apane bacchon ko samay dena chaahati hai
 Karishma married Sanjay Kapoor in 2003
 lekin do saal pehle donon kaa talaak ho gaya
 Karishma is the mother of a son and a daughter
 sandip ke saath unke rishte kaaphi charchaa main rahe, lekin ve shaadi na kar, apane bacchon ko samay dena chaahati hai

 In August 2013, my client Bhavesh Mehta called me
 ve dashakon se mere client hai
 He looked a bit upset
 unhone kaha, ''gaurav, aajkal dollar ke mukaable rupaya gir rahaa he to kya tumhen lagata he ki mujhe apane saat saal ke bete kii uniwarsity kii padhai ke liye masik nivesh badha dena chahie?”mehta ko phikr ho rahi thi ki agar rupaya isi tarah kamjor hota rahaa to rohit kii padhai ke liye kii ja rahi bachat puri nahin padegi
 He was so worried about this matter that he even said, "if necessary, we should stop going to Dubai during Diwali holidays and deposit that money
" ”jaahir he ki halaat itane bhi kharaab nahin the
 Yet one can understand the parents' concern
 padhai kaa kharch lagaataar badhata ja rahaa he or zyada-se-zyada mata-pita bachapan se hi apane bacchon kii aage kii padhai ke liye bal shiksha nidhi main nivesh karne lage hai
 The reason that has made this apprehension and insecurity even bigger is our reluctance and inattention to teach children the right management of money
 hamaara daftar har teen maheene main apane clients kii kul vittiya sthiti kii samiksha karata he or main hameshaa is baat ke liye jid karata hum ki client apane bacchon ko saath lekar aaen

 "rashmi understood my gesture and after five minutes she got a call," Can we do this meeting on Saturday, so that Sonia can also come? He does not have class on Saturday morning
 ”chintaaon ko paise se dur nahin kiya ja saktaa
 So just saving money and investing for the child's education does not calm your mind
 yah baat alag he ki financial skim or product banane, use bechney vaale log aapaki isi asuraksha or dar kii bhaawanaaon ko hawa denge taaki aap aise mutual fund or beemaa yojanaon main apana paisa lagaaein, jinhen aapke bachche kii shiksha or bhavishya ke liye phydemand sauda bataaya ja rahaa he
 It is very easy for the restless mind to sell such products
 main yah nahin kah rahaa ki aapako apane bachche ke bhavishya ke liye bachat or nivesh nahin karnaa chahie
 Must do
 lekin is kaam ke liye puunji ikattha karne ke vaaste sirf bacchon se judi yojanaon main hi nivesh karnaa jaruri nahin he
 Especially when most of these schemes charge more than normal
 ab jaraa buniyadi baton ko samajhen
 All child-related schemes invest either in equity or debt markets or both
 rin bazaar kaa matlab bharat sarkaar or companiyon ke jari band or dibenture main nivesh karnaa he
 In individual capacity, we can invest directly in equity and debt schemes
 ham sidhe share bazaar se equity kharid sakate hai, sarkari band yaa companiyon ke dibenture le sakate hai or bainkon kii saavadhi jamaa yojanaon main apana paisa jamaa kar sakate hai
 Apart from this, the post office also has schemes like National Savings Letter, Kisan Vikas Patra, Lok Provident Fund, which are actually loan schemes
 jinke paas equity yaa rin bazaar main paisa lagane kaa kaushal, samajhdaari or samay nahin he, ve sirf mutual fund yojanaon ko chun sakate hai
 These schemes themselves invest in debt or equity or both
 aakhir main is baat par jor kyon de rahaa hum ki aap ye kaam khud karen? ek kaaran to yah he ki laagat ke hisaab se khud nivesh karnaa bacchon ke liye khaastaur par banaai gai yojanaon kii tulana main zyada phydemand he
 Its second biggest advantage is that you can tweak the investment according to your need
 nivesh ke nae or behatar avasar hameshaa aate rahete hai
 Therefore, instead of putting all your money in one plan, it is wise to keep the options open
 iskaa doosraa pahalu bhi he
 Many times people do not have discipline on their own and they become negligent in regular investment
 agar aapke saath bhi aisa he to aap sirf bacchon se judi yojanaon main hi dhan lagaaein
 There will be no mistake in depositing money for the future of children
 aap mutual fund yojanaon, band tathaa phixd diposit yojanaon kaa kuch naam bhi rakh sakate hai, jinamein aap apane bachche kii shiksha ke liye dhan jamaa karte rahen
 i have advised many people to do the same
 viraat or nandita niyamit nivesh main anushaasit nahin rah pate
 He named the equity plan an education plan and this idea was a big success
 ab ve darshit shiksha yojana main paisa jamaa karne main kabhi nahin chookte kyonki ve jaanate hai ki ve apane bete ke darshit bhavishya ke liye paisa jamaa kar rahe hai
 In this way they have emotional reassurance
 vaise mata-pita ko chintaa se to kabhi mukti nahin milti
 There are always different types of questions
 ham jo dhan jamaa kar rahe hai, kya vah paryaapt hoga? kya ham apane bacchon ko paisa jamaa karnaa or sanbhaalanaa sikhaaen? is chintaa se dur rahane kaa sabase acha upaay yahi he ki niyamit rup se nivesh kiya jaae
 Often parents ask me the question, "what is the right age to teach children money and banking methods?" My only answer is, "one day before they take them to the shopping mall
" ” mujhe yah baat kabhi samaj main nahin aati ki mata-pita apane bacchon ko bazaar le jate samay kabhi chintit nahin hote, lekin unhen bank bhejne main hichakate hai
 He argues that shopping will never distract his attention from studies, but if sent to the bank or taught how to handle money, then the attention of the children can get distracted and they can become careless
 paise ko sanbhaalane se judi aisi kai gatividhiyaan hai, jo main apni beti ke saath kar rahaa hum or apane clients ko bhi karne ke liye kahata hum
 Give your child a jar at a very young age and name it — the chocolate bank
 bacchon se kahen ki use jo bhi chocolate milti he, use bank main rakhen or saptaah main ek yaa do baar khaaen
 There will be two things from this
 ek to bacchon kii chocolate khaane kii aadat par ankush lagegaa or duusare ve dekh sakenge ki jaar main chocolate daalane par sankhya badhati jaati he or khaane par kam ho jaati he
 This will make it easier for them to understand the difference between saving and spending
 meri beti kaa janmdin 18 taarikh ko hota he
 On the 18th of every month, he gets a chance to buy a gift
 is kaam main donon taraf se puraa anushaasan he
 We never forget the 18th date and if we do not have to be in the city on that date, then we get it already given to her
 vah bhi maheene ke baaki dinon main koi jid nahin karti
 If she needs a big gift, she can save the gift money for a few months
 isse bachche ko apane laalach par kaabo rakhana aata he
 When you start giving money to the children for school expenses, always keep an account yourself and ask them to keep an account as well
 dhyaan rahe, agar aap apane kharch kaa hisaab nahin rakhenge to aapke bachche bhi jaldi hi hisaab rakhana chhod denge
 If you keep an account carefully then children will also do it all their lives
 aapkaa baccha jab aath yaa nau saal kaa ho jaae to uske naam se kisi bank main aavarti khaataa khol den
 Start with a small amount
 use bank jane den, jamaa parchi bharne den, rakam jamaa karaane den, parchi par muhar lagavane den or dekhen ki passbook main sahi pravishti ho jaae
 Keep in mind that going to the bank is as easy as going to the store or mall
 ab hamaare kuch bank khaaton ke passbook ko niyamit rup se apadet karaane kii jimmedaari meri beti kii he
 One day she understood my 71-year-old father that a new machine had arrived in the bank
 vah passbook mashin main daalati he, mashin apane aap panne palatati he or saare len-dein tareekhwar chhap detii he
 i could see how proud my father was feeling
 agle hi pal unhone apni jeb main haath daalaa or pachaas ru
 He said, "go buy the chocolate for yourself
" is chocolate ko apane chocolate bank main jamaa karne kii jarurat nahin he
 Can eat now
 ” maine majaak main chutki lee, ''aap kaala dhan jamaa karnaa sikhaa rahe hai
 "when you start giving money to the children for school expenses, then keep an account for yourself and ask them to keep an account as well
 dhyaan rahe, agar aap apane kharch kaa hisaab nahin rakhenge to aapke bachche bhi jaldi hi hisaab rakhana chhod denge
 If you keep an account carefully then children will also do it all their lives

 agle kuch hafton main bhartiya sena kii mountain strike kor tainaati ke apane kshetra—himalay main 'yuddh' kii taiyaari kaa pradarshan karegi
 In its first exercise since its inception in 2014, the 17 Corps at Ranchi will deploy its Brigade Size Medium Artillery, three Integrated Combat Troopers (ibgs) equipped with helicopters, tanks and armored on the Line of Actual Border (LAC)
 yah sainya abhyaas pakistan ke saath vartmaan main tanaavpurn or sangharsh ke muhane par khadi niyantran rekha (elosi) se bahut dur hoga, lekin doklam se bahut dur nahin, jahaan bharat or china ke bich 2017 main 72 dinon tak sainya gatirodh chalaa tha
 Army Chief General Bipin Rawat and his warlord will watch the exercise very carefully as many things for which they have worked for months during this period
 topakhane or bakhtarband se las 5,000 sainikon vaali is choti magar teji se acshan ke liye taiyaar ibiji ko bhavishya kii sena banane ke liye sena pramukh ne bada daanv lagaaya he
 This is the largest reorganization of the Indian Army in which there has been almost no reorganization since independence
 sena ke varisht adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki uttari yudhakshetra main apni tarah kaa yah pehla abhyaas he, china ke saath april 2005 ke us protocol kaa sammaan karata he, jo donon pakshon ke bich elesi par ek divijan (lagbhag 15,000 sainikon) se zyada bade paimaane ke sainya abhyaas se bachane kaa vachan detaa he
 The exercise, which is over 10,000 feet above sea level, is yet to be named because according to army officials, they want to maintain its secrecy
 yah purvi kaman ke antargat apni ekmaatr strike kor kaa upyog karke pahaado main yuddhayas shuru karne kii sena kii kshamta ko bhi pramanit karegaa
 The three mountain ibgs have been sorted from 59 core divisions at Panagarh of 17 cores
 kor mukhyalay bhi is puure abhiyaan kii nigaraanee ke liye ranchi sthit apane base se nikalakar morche par pahonchega jisaki taiyaari kai hafton se chal rahi he
 The details related to this military exercise have been kept secret, but military strategy experts say that these fighting units can do some such exercises
 ek, ranneetik mahatv vaale rajmarg kii nakaabandi, aakraamak abhiyaan ke liye agrim morcha taiyaar karnaa, chumbi ghati ke liye khatra paidaa karne vaale kshetra ko kabje main lenaa yaa ek jami hui nadi ko paar karke or hamalaa bolkar kisi chaowkee par kabja karnaa
 Big bets on IBG The Indian Army has been accumulating a stock of missiles, tanks and ammunition for what it calls a 10 (I) scale battle for a 10-day intensive war since its tussle with Pakistan in 2016
 sena ke pramukh yuddh yojanakaar sainya abhiyaan mahanideshak (dijiemo) jammu-kashmir se lekar kuccha ke ran tak ke ilaakon kaa lagaataar adhyayan kar rahe hai or un kshetron main ibiji kii tainaati kii sambhaavnaaon kaa pataa laga rahe hai
 Has the possibility of war with Pakistan increased in recent years? On this question, General Rawat says to India Today, "you do not declare war
" '' jaahir he, ve yuddh main chaunkaane vaale pahalu par jor dete hai
 The army chief said, "no one would want to go to war, but if the (situation) starts getting out of hand, we will not hesitate to take some limited action
" '' 'haath se nikalnaa' gambhir uksaave kii karrwai kaa ek spasht sandarbh he
 For example, a terrorist attack from across the border that causes large scale destruction of life and property
 general ravat sweekaar karte hai ki shatru 'apratyaashit' he or agar aap in dinon pakistan se aa rahe bayanon ko dekhen to 'apratyaashit' bahut sanyamit shabd hoga
 The army chief hopes that about a dozen ibgs will be ready along the western border with Pakistan in the next four to five years
 unka istemaal twarit javaabi karrwai ke liye kiya jayega
 The objective of the IBG is to break into the enemy's security system and enter the enemy's border within a few hours, not to take a few days to cross the border as before
 iskaa makasad hoga shatru ke seemaa kshetra main ghuskar kabja karnaa or uske ilaake main launch pad taiyaar kar lenaa taaki sainikon kaa mukhya bal aaraam se vahaan pahunch sake
 Even as the 17 Corps is getting ready for maneuvers in its mountainous region, 9 Corps located in the Yola, present in the foothills of the Himalayas near Dharamshala, have been placed for reorganization
 chandi mandir sthit pashchimi kaman ke antargat aane vaali ek kor ko teen ibiji main baant diya jayega
 The ibgs will be tailored to the sector and sector
 koi bhi do ibiji ek jaise nahin honge
 Says General Rawat, "till now there was a similar system for everywhere but now we are moving towards preparing IBG keeping in mind the sector and the region
 '' ibiji kaa maardarshak paksh kya hoga, iske liye ve ek khaas shabd tititiar kaa istemaal karte hai jiskaa matlab he' threat (khatra), terrene (ilaaka), task (lakshya) or resorcej (sansaadhan)
 ibg's resources include tanks, artillery and its essential equipment will be determined by what the target is assigned to it, what the area is like and the level of risk there
 pakistan ke punjab praant ke maidani ilaakon ke liye jahaan pakistan kii tainaati sabase majboot he, vahaan bhartiya ibiji tinkon, baari or halke anti-tanks units or dich-kam-band (disibi) se baari pratirodh kii ummid kar saktaa he
 Therefore, the campaign in this area would require air support from the Air Force's new AH-64E Apache helicopter equipped with anti-tank weapons, armored vehicles to carry troops and cannons capable of flying tanks
 ibiji general ravat kii china or pakistan se ek saath sainya khatre ke liye sena kii sanrachanaon kii taiyaari yojana ke sabase mahatvapurn pahaluon main se ek hai
 The IBG proposal will soon be sent to the government for approval
 battle group paidal sena kii mul 'ol-akvars' unit kii jagah le saktaa he
 The deployment of the division, which consists of 18,000 soldiers and artillery brigades, helicopters, signals and engineering regiments, has been found to be laborious and very slow moving
 sena ne divijan mukhyalay ko khud hi khatm karne kaa prastaav diya he
 The strategic initiative reorganization was launched last year with studies from four committees
 prayek samiti ke adhyaksh leftinent general the or inkaa uddeshy maidani sena kaa punarnirmaan karnaa, nai dilli main sena mukhyalay main sainya karmiyon kii sankhya kam karnaa or sena ke afasaron or javaanon kii seva sharton kii samiksha karnaa tha
 The aim was to reduce the number of military personnel to 1,00,000, and the savings from that could be used to increase the army budget
 ibiji ke hone se sena ko ummid he ki vah lambey samay se chali aa rahi apni kamajori ko dur kar sakegi or vah kamajori he pakistani sena ke khilaaf dandatmak hamalaa karne kii aakshamata
 Until recently, the army acted under the Sundarji doctrine
 yah siddhant 1980 ke dashak main sena ke is purv pramukh ne sthapit kiya tha: pakistan kii seemaa par tainaat saat rakshaatmak kor or teen aakraamak 'hamalavar' kor desh ke bhitari hisse se laai jaae
 But the first flaw in the Sundarji doctrine was noticed in 2001
 disambar 2001 main sansad par aatanki hamale ke baad sena ko apni 'hamalavar' kor ko tainaat karne main 20 din se zyada lag gaye the
 The Army believes that this heavy-handed exercise has foiled a sudden and rapid attack at a time when Pakistan was yet to lay landmines and its own offensive force was far from the border
 varsh 2004 main shuru kiye gaye cold start siddhant main aath divijan ke baraabar aakaar vaale ibiji ko seemaa par tainaat karnaa tha jiskaa uddeshy ilaake par kabja jaise simit lakshyon ke liye seemaa-paar hamalon ko anjaam dena tha
 But there were fears that Pakistan could launch a nuclear attack if attacked deep inside
 baharhaal, in yojanaon ko 2016 main general ravat ke senadhyaksh banane tak kabhi amal main nahin laayaa gaya
 Even after several Cold Start maneuvers, the army did not form the IBG
 general ravat kaa maananaa tha ki seemaa ke najadik ek ekikrut unit ke taur par use sthaayee rup se tainaat kiya jaae or vah unit saare sainik sajo-saamaan se las ho jiske paas topein, yudhak ejeeniyar or signal ikaiyaan hon
 It would be like the basic combat structure in the US — the Striker Brigade Combat Team
 prayek striker brigade main 4,500 jawan or 300 se zyada bakhtarband vaahan hote hai
 The Indian Army will evaluate its results by converting 40 of its infantry divisions into ibgs, only then will it expand
 aage kii sochjammu-kashmir main pakistan samarthit aatankwaad se ladgaye ke liye sena ke pravesh kaa yah 30waan saal ho jayega
 Nearly one-third of the Indian army, comprising 1

 china or pakistan ke saath vivaadit simaaon par sena kii badi maujuudagi bani hui he
 Analysts refer to the effect of this as the army 'leco-karan', where the army has to fight a different kind of war, out of its original job of fighting external attacks

 '' sena ke vishleshkon ko ibiji kii avadharana main sena ke vishaal aakaar ko kam karne kaa avasar dikhataa he
 There is also an opportunity to make it agile and flexible in the battlefield

 This would require the operation of the knowledge, deep understanding all-armament concept which has been lightened by a large part of the Infantry and which considers Counter Insurgency as the primary and only operational area of expertise
 ''singapore sthit es
 Anit Mookerjee, assistant professor in the South Asia Program at the Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS), calls them an 'essential concept' but he also cautions a bit

 Apart from the operation area, where is the army being trained to work in such ibgs
 ''isamen koi andeh nahin ki is saal ke ant main jab ibiji shuru kiya jayega to is tarah ke sawaal uthenge
 Their success will prove to be very important in deciding whether the Indian Army would like to be more agile or to be criticized for maintaining its sheer size

 The location kept changing
 Many agencies including Munirup STF were searching for Munir, the murder accused of NIA officer Tanjeel Ahmed
 munir ke do saathi pehle hi giraftaar kiye ja chuke the
 Munir was constantly changing his location
 tanzeel kii hatya ke baad munir dedh din apane gaanv sahaspur main rahaa or phir waha se lakhanu, gajiabad, azamgarh jaakar apane saathiyon ke saath chipa rahaa

 In Bijnor, Munir and his companions had looted about 91 lakhs
 police lagaataar unke peeche padi thi
 Munir and his associates suspected that Tanjil Ahmed had informed the police about them
 iske alaava bhi kuch maamalon main munir ko shaq tha ki tanzeel uske saathiyon ko giraftaar karvaa rahaa he
 For this reason, he considered Tanjil as his enemy
 jiske chalate munir ne apane saathi reyaan ke saath milakar us vakt tanzeel par hamalaa kiya, jab ve bijanour main ek shaadi samaaroh se hokar apane parivaar ke saath waapas laut rahe the

 There was no one else to shoot the guards but the vicious gangster Munir

 madhyapradesh ko tiger state kaa darja milane ke baad se puri kamalnath sarkaar apni peeth thap-thapaane main lag gai thi
 There were big advertisements of CM Kamal Nath in newspapers
 lekin tiger state kaa darja milane ke baad 3 baaghon kii maut par bijepi ne sawaal khadey kiye hai or tiger state ke darje par credit lene ko sarkaar kii besharmi bataaya he
 Two days ago, Prime Minister Narendra Modi released the tiger population across the country and gave Madhya Pradesh the status of a tiger state with 526 tigers
 saalon baad mili tiger state ke darje se kamalnath sarkaar itani gadgad hui ki akhabaaron main vigyaapan dekar is sammaan kaa shrey khud ko de diya
 There will hardly be any such newspaper in Madhya Pradesh capital Bhopal in which the government has not beaten the drum of getting tiger state status by advertising
 lekin jis vakt tiger state kaa darja milane par soobe ke mukhiya kamalnath kii akhbaaron main tasviren chap rahi thi usee vakt madhyapradesh ke bandhavgarh tiger rigerv main baaghon kii maut kii tasviren khinchi ja rahi thim
 Actually, 3 tigers have died in 2 days in Bandhavgarh National Park
 ye mautein tab hui jab 3 din pehle hi madhyapradesh ko tiger state kaa darja diya gaya he
 The bodies of a tigress, her nine-month-old cub and another tiger have been found in the Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve
 yahi nahin, bijepi ne beete 7 maheenon main hui baaghon kii maut ke aankade jari kar sarkaar par hamalaa bolaa he
 20 tigers killed in eight months BJP says that a total of 20 tigers have died in Madhya Pradesh since the coming of the Kamal Nath government
 purv mantri or bijepi vidhayak vishwaas saarang kii ore se vidhansabha main baaghon kii maut ko lekar puche gaye ek sawaal ke jawaab main khud sarkaar ne bataaya he ki disambar 2018 se 27 june 2019 tak madhya pradesh main 17 baaghon kii maut hui he
 Of these, 3 tigers died due to poaching while 5 tigers died due to electrocution
 baaki ke baagh aapasi ladaai yaa phir prakritik kaarnon se maare gaye
 At the same time, 3 more tigers died after getting the status of Tiger State
 jiske baad kamalnath sarkaar main baaghon kii maut kaa aankada 20 tak ja pahunchaa he
 BJP says that tiger state got status because of his government but Congress government is taking false credit by advertising it
 vishwaas saarang ne kaha ki yah sarkaar kii besharmi he
 In his 8-month tenure, 17 tigers died
 aap ne hi vidhansabha main mere prashn ke badale main yah jawaab diya or jis din tiger state ghoshit hua uske baad teen baagh or mar gaye
 You are patting your back, printing advertisements for the Chief Minister
 tiger kii sankhya 2003 ke baad badi he to vah bhartiya janata party kii sarkaar kaa prayaas he kyonki tiger kii sankhya badhanaa koi do chaar maheene kaa kaam nahin hota yah ek process he
 Digvijay Singh was in the government for 10 years and due to this, the number of tigers in our country declined very fast in 2006 and after that the government woke up
 hamaari sarkaar ne kaam karnaa shuru kiya or hamane 543 tiger kii sankhya tak pahunchaa diya or 8 maheene ke shasankaal main congress ne 20 tiger ko ganvaa diya'
 Mutual fighting is the cause of death - when questions are raised about the death of tigers getting constant, the government also had to come forward to clarify
 kamalnath sarkaar main van mantri umang singhar kaa kahana he ki baaghon kii maut kii ek badi vajah apane-apane ilaake ko lekar hone vaali ladaaiyaan hai jise sarkaar kshetrafal badhaakar kam karne kii koshish main lagi he
 Umang Singhar said that there is nothing to take credit
 main to yah kahana chahta hum ki vanya praani agar hamaari echosystem se jude hai to usamen credit lene vaali koi baat hi nahin he
 Time and again, it is said that the lions died
 ab vah shikaar kii vajah se mare yaa aapas main ladaai yaa territary ke kaaran mare hai
 This thing is important
 sher marate hai adhiktar vah aapasi ladaai ke kaaran marate hai
 We are increasing the territorial area, so we are making many centuries so that the area of the tiger grows and does not fight among themselves

 The facts related to the scam are as follows - in the quarter ended September 30, 2008 - the company's balance sheet shows fake bank balance and cash of Rs 5040 crore - the interest of Rs 376 crore in it is wrong
 - It has also been mentioned in fake liability of Rs

 Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said, 'even when the earth was shivering with Babur's tyranny, Guru Nanak left no stone unturned to raise his voice against the barbarity
 ye guru krupa hi he ki koi bhi sikh kabhi sir nahin jhukaata
 The coordination of weapons and scripture is not the same here

 Former Pakistan captain Imran Khan believes that Sachin Tendulkar should retire from cricket after India won the World Cup last year
 imran ne kaha ki ham sabhi badi uplabdhi ke saath khel se vidaa lenaa chaahate he lekin hameshaa aisa ho nahin paata
 The moment for Sachin was to win the World Cup
 usne vishwa cap main behtareen khel dikhaaya
 He is a great player and has no option
 unhone kaha ki use khud tay karnaa he ki khel ko alavida kab kahana he
 Would not like to leave after losing 4–0 to Australia
 vishwa cap ke baad vah cricket se sanyas letaa to isse behatar kuch nahin hota
 Imran said that Indian players have the right to decide about their retirement and the management will have to find their options first
 unhone kaha ki khilaadiyon ke liye yah kathin sawaal he ki vah kab sanyas lenge, yah kaaphi kathin faisla he
 Imran said that in Indian cricket there is not one but three or four such players
 ahm sawaal unke vikalp kaa he
 If there is a long gap between the young and experienced players then the aged players have to be placed in the team
 tendulkar ke bahupratikshit sauve antarrashtriya shatak ke bare main unhone kaha ki mahaan khilaadiyon ke liye aankade myne nahin rakhte
 He said that records are made to be broken
 ricard banane ke liye koi nahin kheltaa
 The records are part of the win, Sachin is a great player
 main kabhi yah nahin sochataa ki usne 99 shatak banaaye hai yaa 100
 He said that in my view the greatest cricketer is Viv Richards
 mujhe unka ricard dekhne kii jarurat nahin he
 He is great because he loved challenges
 ricard aankade hi to hai jo mahaan khilaadiyon ke liye myne nahin rakhte
 Imran said that if his team had suffered a humiliating defeat abroad like India, he would have said goodbye to the game
 unhone kaha ki main to sanyas le letaa
 If i am in a team that has lost eight consecutive Tests, i would have left the game

 With the announcement of election dates in five states, the number of rallies and public meetings has increased
 congress adhyaksharahul gandhimadhya pradesh main road sho karne ke baad ab rajasthan kii janata ke bich pahunch rahe hai, jahaan vah 9 va 10 oktober ko alag-alag chunavi kaaryakramon main hissaa lenge
 Rahul will begin his tour from Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje from Gadhaulpur
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki rahul gandhi apane road sho ke dauraan jile kii sabhi chaar vidhansabha siton ko cover karenge, jisaki shuruyaat dhaulpur se hogi or rahul kaa kafila mahua tak jayega
 This road show is being told about 150 kilometers, in which Rahul will reach from the party workers to the general public
 rahul pichley do maheenon main mahaj do baar hi rajasthan ke daure par gaye hai, lekin ab jabaki har koi chunaav mod main aa gaya he, aise main rahul kaa vasundhara ke garh se chunavi campan kaa aagaaj karnaa bhi kaaphi ahm mana ja rahaa he
 What is the program? Congress President Rahul Gandhi is reaching Dhaulpur tomorrow on a 2-day visit to 5 districts of Rajasthan
 mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje ke ghar dhaulpur se apana road sho shuru karenge or bharatpur hote hue dausa jile main pahunchenge
 On Tuesday morning, at around 11:30, Rahul Gandhi will come from Delhi to Maniya of Dholpur
 11:40 par mania main nukkad sabha sambodhit karenge or uske baad bas main savaar hokar apana road sho shuru karenge
 Rahul Gandhi will address a dozen small and two big public meetings in the 150 km long roadshow
 dhaulpur ke basedi or gulab poor main bhi rahul gandhi kii sabha he
 After this, you will enter Bharatpur district via Bayana and from there will come to Mahua in Dausa and finish your road show at 8:00 pm
 dhaulpur kii maharani hai vasundhara rajemaujuuda mukhyamantri or bijepi netaa vasundhara raaje sindhiya kaa is jile se purana naata he
 Vasundhara Raje, the daughter of the Gwalior royal family, was married to Hemant Singh, the king of Dholpur
 haalanki, 1972 main shaadi ke kuch vakt baad hi donon alag ho gaye, lekin vasundhara ne dhaulpur nahin choda or vahaan kii rani banakar janata kaa sneh praapt karti raheen
 Even Vasundhara Rane made her political career debut from the same Dholpur, when in 1985 she contested the assembly elections from Dholpur seat for the first time and won
 dhaulpur kaa siyaasi samikarndholpur jila bharatpur sambhag main aata he or yahaan kul 4 vidhansabha seat hai, inamen 3 siten saamaanya varg ke liye hai, jabaki 1 seat anusuchit jati (SC) ke liye arakshit he
 Congress won 2 seats in the 2013 assembly elections
 jabaki bijepi or bispi ko 1-1 seat mili thi
 This was when the Congress won only 21 seats out of 200 in the entire state
 jile kii 90 fisadi se zyada aabaadi hindu he, jabaki yahaan kareeb 6 fisadi muslim jansankhya he
 The Scheduled Castes 20 and Scheduled Tribes constitute about 5 percent of the population
 yahaan brahman, kushavaah ke alaava gurjar or rajput vot bhi nirnaayak bhoomika main he
 BSP also has a significant influence of SC votes in Dholpur, bordering Factor Madhya Pradesh, due to which Bahujan Samaj Party has been winning here
 2013 ke chunaav main bispi ko jile kii chaaron siton par 1 lakh se zyada vot (23%) praapt hua tha or party tisare number rahi thi
 Whereas Congress got the highest 36% votes and BJP got 32% votes here
 dhaulpur seat kii hi baat kii jaae to basapa ke tikat par biel kushvaha ne yahaan se baaji maari thi
 But in December 2016, BL Kushwaha was sentenced to life imprisonment and Kushwaha's wife Shobharani joined the BJP on charges of plotting murder
 2017 main shobhaarani ne bijepi ke tikat yahaan se upachunaav ladaa or vah jeet gayi
 In the 2008 elections too, the BSP had given a tough challenge to this seat and it was defeated by 700 votes from Congress and about 2 thousand votes from BJP
 dhaulpur ke alaava basedi seat par bhi basapa ne 2013 ke chunaav main acha pradarshan kiya tha or tisare number par rahete hue use 26 fisadi vot share mila tha
 Whereas BJP got 36 and Congress got 35 percent votes
 rajkheda seat par bhi bispi tisare number par rahi thi
 In such a situation, BSP supremo Mayawati's decision not to tie up with the Congress may affect the outcome of Dholpur district
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki dhaulpur main bijepi kii kamajori ko dekhte hue bispi factor se paar paane ke liye rahul ne yahaan jaan foonkane pahunch rahe hai

 This is published directly from Syndicate Feed) (NDTV team has not edited this news
 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he) The good news came from the Gir Sanctuary of Gujarat that the number of Babbar lions or Asiatic lions found only in this area has increased drastically in the last five years
 jo sankhya varsh 2010 main 411 thi, vah ab badhkar 523 ho gai he
 Significantly, the lions, which were once found only in an area of 1,400 square kilometers of the Gir Sanctuary, now comprise eight districts of Gujarat - Junagadh, gir-somnath, Amreli, Bhavnagar, Botad, Rajkot, Jamnagar and Porbandar
 22,000 square kilometers have been found in the area
 gir abhayaarany ke up-sangrakshak sandip kumaar kehete hai, "yah kahana galat hoga ki sher nae ilaakon main fail rahe hai
 
 
 Actually, the reality is that they are taking back their old territories
 
 
 uplabdh jaankaree ke mutabik 19veen sadi main ye babbar sher gujarat ke alaava, rajasthan, dilli, uttar pradesh, bihar or maujuuda pakistan tak ke ilaakon main paae jate the, lekin dhire-dhire in ilaakon se ve gaayab hote gaye or 20veen sadi aate-aate ve sirf junagarh ke gir abhayaarany ke ilaake ke 1,400 varg kilometre main simatakar rah gaye
 
 
 " varsh 1990 tak ye sher amuman isi gir abhayaarany main paae jate the, lekin uske baad se ve nirantar nae ilaakon main fail rahe hai
 The maximum increase in this has taken place in the last five years only
 varsh 2010 main kareeb 10,000 varg kilometre ilaake main inaki gananaa hui thi, jo is baar badhkar 22,000 varg kilometre tak ja pahunchi he
 The map has a sea area downstream of the Gir Sanctuary, or to the south, so they are mostly spreading in the north, west and east areas, but this rapidly growing area also poses new challenges to the forest department
 Are of so, jahaan sheron kii sankhya badhanaa behad khushi kii baat he, vahiin ilaake main badhotaree kii vajah se kai nae intjaam karne kii zarurat bhi mahasoos kii ja rahi he
 These include the ability to conduct rescue operations, increase information, awakening people on how to live with animals, and also arranging for the breeding of lions if new areas come along
 tippaniyan That is why the Chief Minister of the state, Anandiben Patel has instructed the Forest Department to work with the Forest Department along with irrigation (to provide water facilities) and also the revenue department
 mahatvapurn baat yah bhi he ki jaankaron ke anusaar, agar sheron ke nae ilaakon main jane kaa silsilaa yun hi berokatoke badhata rahaa to aane vaale vakt main babbar sher ahmedabad or usase bhi aage tak gujarat ke baahar bhi prakritik vaataavaran main rahete dekhe ja sakenge

 Sandeep Kumar, the Deputy Conservator of the Gir Sanctuary, says, “it would be wrong to say that lions are spreading to new areas
 
 
 darasal, hakeekat yah he ki ve apane puraane ilaakon ko waapas le rahe hai
 
 
 According to the available information, in the 19th century, these Babbar lions were found in areas other than Gujarat, Rajasthan, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and up to present Pakistan, but gradually disappeared from these areas and by the 20th century
 They were reduced to just 1,400 square kilometers in the area of geer Sanctuary in Junagadh
 
 
 " Till 1990, these lions were generally found in the same Gir Sanctuary, but since then they have been continuously spreading in new areas
 isamen sabase zyada ijapha pichley paanch saalon main hi hua he
 In the year 2010, they were counted in an area of about 10,000 square kilometers, which has increased to 22,000 square kilometers this time
 nakshe main gir abhayaarany ke neeche kii ore, yaa kahen ki dakshin main samudr kaa ilaaka he, isliye ve zyaadaatar uttar, pashchim or purv ke ilaakon main hi fail rahe hai, lekin teji se badhate is ilaake ne van vibhaag ke saamne nai chunautiyaan bhi khadi kii hai
 So while increasing the number of lions is a matter of great pleasure, due to the increase in the area, the need to make many new arrangements is also being felt
 inamen rescue oparation kii kshamta, jaankaree badhanaa, jaanwaron ke saath kaise nibhaayaa jaae, is bare main logon main jagriti laana or saath main nae ilaake aane se sheron ke prajnan main bhi vruddhi hogi to uskaa bhi intjaam karnaa shaamil hai
 The comments isiilie rajya kii mukhyamantri anandiben patel ne van vibhaag ke saath-saath sinchai (pani kii suvidha muhaiyaa karwaane ke liye) or saath-saath mahasul vibhaag ko bhi van vibhaag ke saath milakar kaam karne kii hidaayat di he
 Importantly, according to experts, if the process of moving of lions to new areas continues unabated, then in future, the lion can be seen living in the natural environment outside Ahmedabad and even beyond Gujarat
