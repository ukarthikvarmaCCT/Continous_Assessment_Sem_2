 The genealogy of the idea of inertia or aphrodisiacs (featish) is quite interesting
 yah europe kii simaaon se pare kii 'puraatan samskritiyon' ke saath europe ke judaav or saath hi saath isaki simaaon main atyadhik vyaapt 'aviveki' soch kaa utpaada he
 In the latter case, exporters, merchants, sailors, and others from the early seventeenth century brought with them fantastic stories of objects associated with the divine and magical forces of Africans
 yah baat tab kii he jab europe dwaara africa ilaakon kii lut shuru nahin hui thi, lekin africaiyon ke 'avivek' or bacchon jaise vyavhaar-jisane baad main upniveshwaad kii safai ke ahm pahalu kaa rup akhriyaar kar liya-kii kahaniyon ne aakaar lenaa shuru kar diya tha
 Some African objects associated with reverence, hypnosis and amulets later came to be identified as aphrodisiacs — the Portuguese word fétish — meaning artificial
 kamottejak vastuon kii gati ne karl marks ke lekhan main ek alag tarah kaa naatakeey mode le liya
 Marx's idea of inertialism of useful goods was intended to highlight the irrationality of capitalist thought that was tainted with the objects of life itself and the color of money
 marks ke kehane ke myne yah the ki europea log taarkikta ke apane lakh daavon ke baavjood apni soch se angadh ho sakate hai
 Going further, the conclusion he made was that Africa's antiquarianism was a lower-order thinking
 europea yon vigyaniyon-inamen sabase prasiddh havelock elice (1859-1939) hai-ke lekhanon kii lambii suchi ke jariye jadaasakti us vyavhaar se jud gai jahaan vasteen (udhaaharan ke liye dastaanon kaa joda), yaa sharir ke ang (kah sakate hai pair), jo spasht taur par kisi tarah se sexual nahin lagate, kamoddeepak mahatv kii ho gayi
 The behavior of anachronism or aphrodisiacs has been discussed through terms such as unconventional, mindless, psychotic, low sexuality, disorder and downgrade
 jadaasakti or jadaasaktivaadee jald hi ilaaj sambandhi prakriya kii vastu ban gaeh aap ise ek alag tarah kaa upniveshwaad bhi kah sakate hai
 This history of inertia is seen as the 'dark continent' of the human psyche, the Sex Survey 2009 may force us to think about possible changes about the definition of corrupt and inconsistent
 survey par charchaa karne se pehle do pahalu yaad rakhane kii jarurat he
 First, surveys can also be misleading tools to assess cultural and social behaviors
 koi vishesh sawaal yah kahkar poochna, ''yah sawaal kaaphi jaruri he', isse ek aisi duniya kaa bhav paidaa hota he jo pehle thi hi nahin
 Second, when thinking about sex, the current scenario of globalization and consumerist modernism becomes quite important
 aaj pehle se kahin zyada hamaare jivan main 'vikalpon kii duniya'kaa vichaar ahm bhoomika nibhaa rahaa he
 This is the context where Indian sexual culture is slowly but surely moving from the 'family planning' perspective of the government's five-year plan to entering the marketplace of the 'sex fun' market
 sex ko mouj-masti (santanotpatti se hatakar) ke taur par dekhne kaa vichaar survey ke dauraan jadaasakti yaa kamottejak vastuon ke sheershak main puche gaye sawaalon kaa mul he
 In such a situation, this is the most important change happening in contemporary Indian society: the desire of middle class women and men to create a world beyond conception and live a life ahead of gender-nationalism
 sambhawatah nae sansar main pravesh karne kii chaah kii jhalak hamen unke dwaara die gaye javaabon main milti he, jaise yon sambandhon ke dauraan koi bhoomika adaa karne kii fantasy ko lekar
 Of the women surveyed, 90 percent said they had never tried to play a role during sex, while 23 percent admitted that they imagined playing a stranger role for their partner
 isi tarah 81 fisadi purushon ne is sawaal kaa jawaab nakaaratmak diya he, 27 fisadi ne kaha ki ve ajanabi ban jane kii fantasy paale hue hai
 If we talk about the particular city, 40% of Delhi and 21% of Ludhiana women have admitted that they played a stranger during sex
 mjedaar baat yah ki dilli or ludhiana ke 16 fisadi purushon ne mana ki unhone ajanabi kii bhoomika adaa kii he
 In this context we have to estimate three things (or at least three)
 pehla, hamaare saamaajik niyam is baat par jor dete hai ki hamen unase shaadi kerani chahie jo hamaari jaisi prishthbhumi (kah sakate hai ki varg or jati ke sandarbh main) rakhte hai, lekin ab is baat ko sweekaar karne main kaaphi khulaapan dikh rahaa he ki shringaaraatmak jivan saamaajik kaayade-kanoonon se sanchalit nahin hota
 Second, it may reveal a widespread desire to clarify the complex nature of intimate relationships such as marriage
 agar yah sach he, to ham pyaar or vivaah kii setament main lee jane vaali dharanaon ke prati ubhar rahe adhik aalochanatmak rukh ke bare main kuch (satark) nishkarsh nikaal sakate hai
 Finally, if we look at the figures of Delhi and Ludhiana for example, there are indications that a large number of women (compared to earlier and men living in these cities) enjoy thinking about sex
 Have started thinking about mahilaon kii mukhyadhara kii kai hindi patrikaon main mahilaon kii langikta ko lekar spasht charchaa sambhawatah is baat kaa sanket he ki bharat main yon sambandhon main ruchi na rakhane vaali maataaon kii sankhya main kami aa rahi he, or masalan, raakhi ke swayamvar se paaramparik aadhuniktaa kii raahen prashast ho rahi hai
 The idea of traditional modernity makes us think about the contradiction in many answers
 masalan, ham is tathy ke saath kaise saamanjasy baithaayenge ki jahaan adhiktar auraten bhoomika adaa karne ke bare main sochati hai (yani yon sambandhon kaa anand doguna karne ke liye), vahiin survey main aisi mahilaon kii badi sankhya he-bangaloru main 30 fisadi, ludhiana main 23 fisadi, or mumbai main 10 fisadi- jo yah sweekaar karti hai ki unhone apane sahabhaagi dwaara balaatkaar kiye jane kii kalpana kii he
 Going forward, 30 per cent of women in Bengaluru have stated that they have implemented their rape fantasies, while the figures for Ludhiana and Mumbai are 29 per cent and 5 per cent respectively
 sambhawatah mumbai kii mahilaon ne apni baat par dobaaraa sochaa, lekin bangaloru or ludhiana ke maamalon main aisa nahin tha
 Are fantasies of masculine power — features that were greatly exaggerated in the Savita Bhabhi cartoon character — still playing a role in women's lives? In the future survey, one more complex factor needs to be noted
 isliye ki mahilaon ne na sirf balaatkaar kiye jane ke sawaal ke jawaab die, balki duusare sawaal ke bhi uttar die jisamen poocha gaya tha ki kya unhone sahabhaagi par balaatkaar karne kii kabhi kalpana kii haih kya ve anivaary rup se itarlingi sambandhon ke bare main soch rahi hai? chaahe jo baat ho, jawaab pareshaan kar dene vaale hai
 It may also force us to consider the number of men who imagine raping their partners: 29 per cent of the total, 56 per cent in Bangalore, 33 per cent in Mumbai and 29 per cent in Hyderabad
 kya yah balaatkaar ko lekar ek rashtriya fantasy he jise baraabar sankhya main stri or purush saajha karte hai? or, kya iskaa mahilaon kii sthiti main (dhime) ho rahe parivartan se vastav main koi lenaa-dena he jo badale main shakti ke sthapit sambandhon se aakraamak pratikriya ko bulaava de rahaa he? yaa aksharshah yah takat hi kamottejak he or jo kaamuk samskruti ke nirmaan main ahm bhoomika adaa kar rahi he? aakhirkaar, is sab ke baavjood, kya aisa nahin he ki bhartiya vaishvikaran ke sabase mukhar chehre bangaloru ko balaatkaar kii fantasy ke maamle main sarvaadhik ooncha aankada darj karana chahie tha
 The number of women who think about or use sex toys at intimate moments is quite modest in all cities: 5 percent and 9 percent, respectively
 shaayad donon hi virgon (sochati hai / prayog kiya) main un shaharon kii mahilaon kii sankhya adhik he jahaan in khilaunon tak unki pahunch aasaan haih mumbai or hyderabad
 The important thing is that the number of women who want to use sex toys is more than the women who use them
 kul milakar aise purushon kii sankhya kaa pratishat bhi kaaphi he jo sex khilaunon kaa prayog kar chuke hai yaa karne ke bare main sochate hai
 In most cities, the number of men who think of experimenting is more than the men who have experimented
 kisi samay sex khilaunon ko lekar hauvva ab kam hota ja rahaa he, or mahilaon main yah rujhaan khaasaa dilachasp he
 First, it shows that there has been a rift in the bastion of male-centered (heterosexual) sexual culture, where male pleasure was self-controlled and uniquely representative
 saath hi, isse upabhokta samskruti ke antarrashtriyakaran kii jhalak bhi milti he, jahaan upbhog kii vastuon ko anand ke maarg ke rup main dekha ja rahaa he, or sex khilone is rukh ko sidhe hi apnaane ko rekhaankit karte hai
 What about content that is easier to acquire than sex toys? Chocolate sauce, ice, ice cream, and honey also appear to be the most preferred sexual aids
 haalanki survey main shaamil mahilaon ne ise lekar bahut zyada ruchi nahin dikhaai he (desh bhar main 9 se 11 fisadi ke bich) sambhawatah aisa shaareerik jaruraton sambandhi arthvyavastha kaa aarthik halaat se saamana hone ke kaaran he, aise main jeet aarthik sthiti kii hi hoti haih agar inaki keemat dekhi jaae to chocolate sos or icecream khaane main zyada santosh dengi
 It is no surprise that the women of Mumbai are well aware of the use of chocolate sauce in addition to ice cream toppings due to their highly expendable income
 kul milakar, adhiktar purush chipchipe khaadya padaarthon ko apni yon sambandhi routine (shaayad routine shabd sahi nahin he) kaa hissaa bana chuke hai, banane kaa vichaar rakhte hai
 Delhi and Jaipur have the highest percentages (36 percent and 26 percent respectively)
 ilaychi or halava jaisi desi vasteen purush yaa mahilaon main zyada rang nahin jamaa pain (jaisaa kai shaharon main barf ne kiya)
 Perhaps the idea of 'good sex' is more associated with being beyond national boundaries, so global items like chocolate and ice cream are in greater demand: then the pudding would be perfectly suited to be associated with 'tradition', but the need for gender modernity answers
 -halwa's understanding
 uttar-halava samaj kii baat karte hue, bondej (bandhan) or disipleen sadomasochism (anushaasan or dard ke jariye anandanubhuti) (bidisam) sareekhee kriyaaon kaa kya jo pashchim kii dein hai? mahilaon kii apeksha un purushon kii sankhya (7 fisadi or 21 fisadi) adhik he jo bidisam ko aajmaana chahenge
 Perhaps women feel that they are already carrying a lot of burden of male bonding and discipline in their everyday lives
 haalanki is baat kii jaankaree nahin milti he ki aakhir kyon kolkata ke purush or mahilaon ne ise lekar atiutsaah dikhaaya haih yahaan ke 69 fisadi purushon or 25 fisadi mahilaon ne ise aajamaane kii baat sweekaar kii
 The idea of matahti takes us to another part of the survey, which is related to the intimate relationships that both men and women desire
 shuruyaat karen, mukh maithun kii soochna se
 The number of men with oral sex (64 per cent) is higher than women (43 per cent), while the number of men (58 per cent) is more than women (32 per cent) in its imagining
 aise main, pataa chalata he ki purush mahilaon kii apeksha apni adhik chalaa rahe hai, or mahilaayein ise aajamaane ko lekar isliye kam utsaahi hai kyonki is par unke sahabhaagi kii ore se koi utsaahi pratikriya nahin milti yaa unase jhaad milti he
 However, in response to another question, 46 per cent of men and 49 per cent of women said that they would like both partners to participate equally in sexual activities rather than being commanded by one
 isiilie patna ke 61 fisadi purush or kolkata ke 78 fisadi purush baraabar kii bhagidaari main yakeen rakhte hai
 What about the idea of inertia as the 'dark continent' that we had initially raised? If we come to a conclusion, it would be that from the survey we find a level of spontaneity when discussing personal things which was previously considered to be very unethical or wrong
 yah punarvichaar kii ek prakriya bhi he joki pathbhrasht or saamaanya vyavhaar kaa nirmaan karti he
 This may be the first step towards thinking about others and oneself, possibly in a different way to black and white

 The Yogi Adityanath government of Uttar Pradesh has written a letter to the district magistrates of four districts of western Uttar Pradesh seeking withdrawal of their cases against BJP MLA Sangeet Som
 sangeet som par farji video ke jariye mujffarnagar main dange bhadakaane ke aarope hai

 ’ The apex court said this while dismissing the petition of one person

 ' Breaking news started circulating on TV channels that Mulayam had given an ultimatum to the Congress party
 kah diya he ki agar vah hangaamaa karti rahi to uskaa saath nahin denge
 This news got a lot of space from government sources
 prashnvachak chinhr ke saath poocha yaa bataaya jane laga ki alag-thalag padi congress
 After all, how did Mulayam and the government try to turn the matter in its court? Let's try to understand him a little
 subah 11 baje loksabhaa kii kaarywahi shuru hui to placord ke saath congress kii narebaaji or hangaamaa bhi shuru ho gaya
 In the meantime, Mulayam Singh Yadav got up and told the speaker that he is ready for debate, 'but you don't call us
 ham chaahate hai ki idhar ke (congress) or udhar ke (sarkaar) netaa saath main bainthe or masalaa sulajhaayen
 The speaker said that if Kharge is ready to talk, i am ready to postpone the Lok Sabha
 ' iske thodi der baat loksabhaa ko 12 baje tak ke liye sthagit kar diya gaya
 Then the meeting started in the Speaker's room
 pehle isamen sirf mulaayam ke alaava argedy, jediu or tiemasi ke netaa shaamil thi
 Later Congress's Mallikarjun Kharge and Jyotiraditya Scindia also joined
 spikar ke kamare main aate-jate donon hi samay khadge ne patrakaron se kaha ki ve sirf party kaa paksh rakhane ja rahe hai
 According to the condition of the Congress, if the government runs, the Parliament will run
 congress apni baat kah ai
 Shortly thereafter, government sources informed that Mulayam gave an ultimatum to the Congress in the meeting
 uske baad kii khabaron se ham sabhi waakif hai
 When Mulayam came out of Parliament, journalists surrounded him
 poocha aapane meeting main kya bolaa
 Mulayam said after a few pleas, i have said what he said in Parliament
 ham chaahate hai ki sansad chale, bahes ho, sabko apni baat rakhane kaa mauka mili
 Sushma Swaraj should also speak
 phir unase kisi ko koi sawaal karnaa ho to karen
 i wanted to know from him whether he was ever in favor of the resignation of Sushma Swaraj or two BJP chief ministers
 unka kahana tha kabhi nahin
 Say how? mulaayam singh yadav ne sushamaa ke istife ke sawaal par ham patrakaron se baat karte hi to kaha tha ki sab log ek mahila ke peeche pade hai
 Women forgive a hundred blood
 itnaa hi nahin sapa ke hi ramgopal yadav samet kai rajyasabha saansad kai baar yah doharaa chuke hai ki sapa congress ke peeche chalane vaali party nahin he
 She has her own agenda, she follows it
 baat bhi sahi he
 Whenever the Samajwadi Party created a ruckus in the Lok Sabha in the well, there was a demand to release the caste census data in the hands of its mps
 aisi hi maang kii takhti lekar argedy or jediu ke saansad wel main aate rahe
 On the issue of Lalitgate and Vyapam, these parties were never with the Congress, not even the TMC
 jab pichley somvaar ko congress ke 25 saansadon ko nilambit kiya gaya to tiemasi ne bich-bachaav kii puri koshish kii
 Saugata Roy and Sudipto Bandopadhyay repeatedly urged the speaker not to take such drastic measures
 jab nilamban ho gaya to phir tiemasi ne bhi congress ke saath paanch dinon tak loksabhaa ke bahishkaar kaa elaan kiya
 Mulayam still did not come with the Congress
 mulaayam congress ke saath agle din yani mangalvaar ko aae jab ve loksabhaa main spikar se nilamban vaapasi kaa anurodh karne gaye, lekin spikar ne unki maang ko tavajjo nahin diya
 Mulayam then came out and confronted the reporters
 sabase ek saath bhi baat kii or alag-alag bhi
 The same Mulayam was not ready to talk to the media after today's meeting
 tippaniyan The message is clear
 mulaayam kii jab sarkaar ne nahin suni to ve sadan ke bahishkaar par utar aae
 If Congress is not doing what Mulayam wants, then he is giving the message of being with the government
 sarkaar ko bhi mauka mil gaya he vipakshi partiyon main foot dikhaane kaa
 Every BJP leader and every minister in the government is reiterating that the Congress has been isolated
 udhar congress ke gulam nabi azaad rajyasabha kaa hawala dekar kah rahe hai ki sabhi vipakshi partiyon ne ek sur main kaha he ki sarkaar ne gatirodh todane ke liye kuch nahin kiya he
 No cracks in opposition
 darasal mulaayam singh yadav apni raajnneetik chaalon ke liye jane jate hai
 No one can guess what they say and what they do till the end
 yahi vajah he ki pichley hafte jahaan unhone congress ke pradarshan main shaamil hone ke liye apane saansadon ko bhi bhej diya, vahiin aaj sarkari sutron ke hawaale se aa rahi jaankaree par tasviir saaf karne kii jarurat nahin samajhi
 In politics, everything is not black and white
 fansaa kar khilne vaala hi asal khilaadi hota he
 The Lok Sabha proceedings started at 11 am, the Congress slogans and ruckus started with placards
 isi bich main mulaayam singh yadav ne uthakar spikar se kaha ki ve bahes ke liye taiyaar hai, 'lekin aap hamen bulaati nahin
 We want the (congress) and the (government) leaders from here to sort out and resolve the issue together
 ' is par spikar ne kaha ki 'agar khadge ji baat karne ko taiyaar hai to main loksabhaa sthagit karne ko taiyaar hum
 'shortly thereafter, the Lok Sabha was adjourned till 12 o'clock
 phir loksabhaa adhyaksh ke kamare main meeting shuru hui
 Earlier it included only leaders of RJD, JDU and TMC apart from Mulayam
 baad main congress ke mallikarjun khadge or jyotiraditya sindhiya bhi shaamil hue
 Both times while coming to the speaker's room, Kharge told reporters that he was only going to keep the party's side
 congress kii jo shart he uske mutabik sarkaar agar chale to sansad chalegi
 Congress came forward to say iske thodi hi der baad sarkari sutron ne jaankaree di ki mulaayam ne meeting main congress ko ultimatum de diya he
 We are all aware of the news after that
 mulaayam jab sansad se baahar aae to patrakaron ne gheraa
 Asked what you said in the meeting
 thodaa maan manuhaar ke baad mulaayam bole maine vahi bolaa he jo sansad main bolaa
 We want Parliament to run, debate, everybody should get a chance to speak
 sushamaa swaraj bhi apni baat rakhen
 Then if anyone wants to ask them any question
 maine unase jaananaa chaha ki kya ve kabhi sushamaa swaraj yaa bijepi ke do mukhyamantriyon ke istife ke paksh main the
 He never said

 Mulayam Singh Yadav had said to reporters on the question of Sushma's resignation that everyone was behind a woman
 mahilaon ko sau khun maaf
 Not only this, many Rajya Sabha mps including sp's Ram Gopal Yadav have reiterated many times that SP is not the party behind the Congress
 uskaa apana agenda he, vah us par chal rahi he
 This is also true
 samaajawaadee party ne jab-jab loksabhaa main wel main aakar hangaamaa kiya, uske saansadon ke haathon main jaateey janaganana ke aankadon ko jari karne kii maang thi
 RJD and JDU mps kept coming to the well with the plank of such demand
 lalitget or vyapam ke mudde par yah partiyaan kabhi bhi congress ke saath nahin thim, tiemasi bhi nahin
 When 25 Congress mps were suspended last Monday, the TMC tried its best to intervene
 saugat raay or sudipto bandopadhyaay ne spikar se baar-baar guzarish kii ki itnaa kadaa kadam na uthaaen
 When the suspension took place, TMC also announced a boycott of the Lok Sabha with the Congress for five days
 mulaayam tab bhi congress ke saath nahin aae
 Mulayam accompanied Congress on the next day i
e
 on Tuesday when he went to the Lok Sabha to request the speaker to withdraw his suspension, but the speaker did not listen to his demand
 phir mulaayam baahar nikalakar patrakaron se mukhaatib hue
 Most talked together and separately
 vahi mulaayam aaj kii meeting ke baad media se baat karne ko taiyaar nahin hue
 The comments sandesh saaf he
 When Mulayam did not listen to the government, he came out on a boycott of the house
 agar mulaayam jaisaa chaah rahe hai, congress vaisaa nahin kar rahi to ve sarkaar ke saath hone kaa sandesh de rahe hai
 The government has also got a chance to show disunity among opposition parties
 bijepi ke har netaa or sarkaar ke har mantri isi baat kii duhai de rahe hai ki congress alag-thalag pad gai he
 On the other hand, Ghulam Nabi Azad of the Congress is referring to the Rajya Sabha, saying that all opposition parties have said in unison that the government has done nothing to break the deadlock
 vipaksh main koi daraar nahin
 In fact, Mulayam Singh Yadav is known for his political moves
 ve kya kehete hai or karte kya hai, iskaa ant tak andaaza koi nahin laga paata
 This is the reason that last week, where he also sent his mps to participate in the Congress demonstration, today there is no need to clear the picture on the information coming from government sources

 Ashfaq Ulla Khan was born on 22 October 1900 in 'shaheedgarh' of Shahjahanpur district in Uttar Pradesh
 pita ek pathan parivaar se taalluk rakhte the
 All the family members were in government jobs, but Ashfaq had to do something for the country since childhood
 bataa den, bengal ke krantikariyon kaa unke jivan par bahut prabhaav tha
 Apart from being a freedom fighter, he also wrote poetry, he also loved horse riding, shooting and swimming
 nahin lagata tha padhane- likhane main manabachapan se hi ashfak ulla khan kaa man padhane- likhane main nahin karata tha
 He enjoyed swimming, taking a gun and going hunting
 ye sach tha ki vah padhane-likhane main apni ruchi nahin dikhaate the, lekin desh kii bhalaai ke liye kiye jane vaale aandolanon kii kathaon / kahaniyon main vah badi ruchi se padhate the
 He wrote quite good poems
 jisamen vah kavita main apana upnaam hasarat likhaa karte the
 He used to write poetry for himself
 unke man main apni kavitaaon k prakashit karwaane kaa koi cheshtaa nahin thi
 His written poems were often sung by revolutionaries of 'kakori Kand' on the way to court
 kakori cond: aise lutaa tha sarkari khajaanamahatma gandhi kaa prabhaav ashfak ulla khan ke jivan par shuru se hi tha, gandhiji ne 'asahyog andolan' waapas le liya to unke man ko atyant pidaa pahunchi
 After this, an important meeting of revolutionaries was held on August 8, 1925 under the leadership of Ramprasad Bismil and Chandrashekhar Azad, in which it was planned to rob the train arriving at saharanpur-lucknow passenger train Kakori station on August 9, 1925, which contained the government treasury

 jiske baad is ghatana ko kakori cond se janaa jaataa he
 Let us tell you, all the revolutionaries changed their names during this incident
 ashfak ulla khan ne apana naam 'kumarji' rakhaa tha
 As soon as the British government came to know about this incident, she went mad
 jiske baad kai nirdosho ko pakadakar jelon main thuns diya tha
 After this incident, the British government captured all the revolutionaries one by one
 lekin lekin chandrasekhar aaazaad or ashfak ulla khan police ke haath nahin aae the
 Let it be said that on 26 September 1925, a total of 40 revolutionaries of the Hindustan Republican Association were arrested
 unke khilaaf rajdroh karne, sashastr yuddh chhedane, sarkari khajaana luutane or musafiron kii hatya karne kaa mukadmaa chalaaya gaya

 Earlier, during an election meeting in Murabadad on Thursday, Mulayam said that it is not appropriate to punish the accused of rape
 
 
 ladakon se galtiyaan ho jaati hai, sapa satta main ai, to is kanoon main badlaav karegi
 Mulayam has given this clarification after his statement became all-round

 input: bhashaa Cricket is a team game, but anytime a player can change the stance of a match
 baavjood iske beeti raat khele gaye hyderabad or kolkata ke bich kade mukaable main kisi ek khilaadi ke pradarshan ko uske captain kaa saath or bharosa hi upar tak pahunchaa saktaa he jaisaa ki raashid khan ke saath hua
 Kane Williamson, who won the team with his bat in every match, captained this time and gave Hyderabad the final ticket by using the right players at the right time
 pehali pari main balle se flop rahe ken ne lakshya ko surakshit karne ke liye aisi ranneeti banaai, jiske saamne bade ballebaajon kii fouj vaali keker bhi post ho gai
 Sunrisers Hyderabad will clash with Chennai in the IPL final, except for Rashid Khan's Atishi innings in the last over of the 14 runs given to KKR, there was nothing special for Hyderabad for the first time
 lekin shandaar gendbaaji vaali hyderabad ne yah bataaya ki kaise lagaataar 4 maichon kii haar ke trend todakar bade match main unki team vaapasi kar sakati he
 In the second innings, captain Kane Williamson drove every maneuver from where the team could be brought back into the game
 power play main kolkata haaavee najar ai or hyderabad ke khilaaf is sijan main sabase zyada 67 ran bator liye
 But the spinners had arrows still in the quiver and proved to be game changers for the same team
 santven over main jab raashid khan ko laayaa gaya, to unhone sirf 3 ran die
 After this Shakib conceded just 7 runs in the 9th over
 phir jab raashid 11waan over karne aae to unhone uthppa ko keemtee wicket jhatka
 After the wicket of Dinesh Karthik in the 12th over and the dismissal of Chris Lynn in the 13th over, Hyderabad's hopes in the match were overshadowed, although the team still had a stormy batsman like Andre Russell
 raashid ne dikhaaya bada dil, afghanistan dhamaake main maare gaye logon ke naam kiya 'main of da match' awordersel ko kiya targetrcel ke liye ken williamson ne khaas ranneeti banaai
 Kane knew that Russell was the player with the ability to snatch the match in just 10 balls
 isi vajah se short leg or slip lagaakar unpar dabaav daalane kii koshish hui
 Rashid's spin and the surrounding players missed Russell's pass and caught Shikhar Dhawan standing on the slip in the process of playing the shot
 yahi wicket match kaa sabase bada terning point sabit hua
 Piyush Chawla and Shubman Gill did show some courage in the final overs, but they did not have the ability to hit big hits like Russell
 captain ne jab rasel ke khilaaf short leg ko khadaa kiya, to yah kaaphi chaunkaane vaala faisla tha
 Due to such fearless decisions, Hyderabad got their place in the finals and now they are ready to take on Chennai Super Kings on Sunday for the title

 agenda ajtak main pahunche champion yuvaraj sinhatim india kii ranneeti par sawaal khadey kiebhartiya team ke champion olerounder rahe yuvaraj singh ne world cap-2019 main team india kii haar ke peeche kii badi vajah kaa khulaasa kiya he
 Yuvraj Singh, who was 38 years old five days ago, said during Agenda Aaj Tak on Tuesday that bad planning was the major reason behind the defeat of this World Cup
 unhone team prabandhan kii kadi aalochana kii or kaha ki is 50 overon ke toornament ke liye unki yojana puri tarah se galat thi
 The title contender India had landed without a number four batsman in the World Cup, which affected the team and Virat Kohli's team was eliminated from the semi-finals
 yuvaraj singh ne kaha ki 2019 ke world cap ke liye number-4 ko lekar team prabandhan kaa meri ore bilkul dhyaan nahin tha, lekin mujhe is baat kaa behad afsos he ki ambati raidu ke saath kya hua
 He fit very well at number-4 after me
 ek saal tak vah team main rahe
 Rayudu played an innings of 90 runs (february 2019) in New Zealand and was also the man of the match
 yuvaraj ne kaha ki iske baad world cap main raidu ko drop kar diya gaya
 Less experienced players like Vijay Shankar (5 odis) and Rishabh Pant (five odis before the World Cup) were given the opportunity
 baad main shankar chotil ho kar baahar ho gaye the, phir bhi itane kam anubhav ke saath koi khilaadi bada match kaise nikaal saktaa he
 Yuvraj took on the management strategy of the team
 yuvaraj ne kaha, ‘meri naaraazgi un chizon se he jo think tanks ne kii
 Dinesh Karthik suddenly plays the semi-finals
 unhen pehle se maaloom nahin rahata ki unhen kis number par ballebaaji kerani he
 Experienced players like MS Dhoni get to bat at No-7
 yani kisi ko kuch pataa nahin tha ki semifinal main kise kahaan utarana he
 Yuvraj said that you cannot do this in such a big match like semi-finals
 us vakt number-4 ke ballebaaj (pant) kaa ucchtam score 48 ran tha
 Yuvraj said, 'I believe the main reason for the defeat was weak planning
 us vakt samajha gaya ki rohit or viraat bade form main hai or vah aasaani se match nikaal lenge
 You look at Australia's previous teams in the World Cup (2003, 2007, 2011, 2015 World Cup) They already had a set batsman
 unka madhyakram pehle se hi tay tha
 Along with Yuvraj Singh, Harbhajan Singh was also present on the agenda till date
 unhone kaha ki bhartiya cricket main saurav ganguli, sachin tendulkar, kapil dev or anil kumble kii charchaa hoti he
 
 
 But if Yuvraj was not there, we would not have won two World Cups (2007 T20 World Cup, 2011 World Cup)
 harbhajan ne kaha ki world cap se yuvaraj singh ke pradarshan ko hataa den, to bhartiya team semifinal tak jarur pahunch jaati, lekin aage kii raah aasaan nahin hoti
 Yuvraj made India the champion by performing all round
 madhya pradesh kii vyapaarik nagari indore main ek yuvati ke saath gangrape kii sansanikhej vaardaat saamne ai he
 The victim is hospitalized in critical condition
 usne philhal kisi ke khilaaf cese darj karaane se inkaar kar diya he
 Due to his non-cooperation, the police is unable to take any action
 sutron ke mutabik, indore ke chatripura thana kshetra main ek yuvati ko mangalvaar raat kuch yuvakon ne rupee udhaar dene ke makasad se bulaayaa tha
 They took the girl to their car
 unhone use kathith taur par sharaab pilaai
 The five youths then raped her
 baad main usko sadak par chhod kar bhaag gaye
 The victim is admitted to hospital in critical condition, where she is undergoing treatment
 usne apane saath hue vaardaat kii baat ko sweekaar kiya he, lekin abhi dar kii vajah se aropiyon ke khilaaf cese darj karaane se inkaar kar rahi he
 The victim says that if a case is registered, she will commit suicide
 diaiji hari narayan chaari mishra ne bataaya ki yuvati se police ne poochtacha kii he
 She was asked to lodge a complaint against the accused, but she has not agreed to it
 yuvati ne kaha ki yadi report likhi gai to vah aatmahatya kar legi, lihaaja yuvati ko uske ghar bhej diya gaya he
 Let us tell you that several consecutive cases of rape have come up in Madhya Pradesh these days
 haal hi main khandwa main khaane kaa laalach dekar do sagi bahanon ke saath rape kii vaardaat ko anjaam diya gaya
 In an ashram meant for the disabled people, two minor real sisters, who are mentally ill, were made victims of their lust by the ashram operator
 isi tarah bhopal main ek pulicekarmi danpati kii beti ke saath ek november kii raat ko gangrape hua tha
 In this case Sanjay Singh Bais, in-charge of the three police stations in charge of MP Nagar, Ravindra Yadav, in-charge of Habibganj police station, Mohit Saxena, station in-charge of GRP Habibganj, two sub-inspectors Tekram and Uike have been suspended
 isvaardatko anjaam dene vaale chaar aropiyon ko police ne giraftaar kiya he, lekin police kii laaparvaahee saamne ai thi
 The victim had said that no criminal should dare to do it again, so strict punishment should be given, they should be killed, hanged at the crossroads so that such incidents do not happen again

 The longest shutdown in US history is now having an impact on the White House, the official voice of President Donald Trump
 beete kuch maheenon se selary nahin milane ke baad white house kichen ke shef chuttee par chale gaye hai
 This brought the White House kitchen to a standstill
 pehle se lunch yaa dinar kaa nimantran paa chuke mehmaanon ke liye raashtrapati trump ne fastfood kaa intjaam karte hue pizza or burgers khilaanaa shuru kar diya he
 Significantly, last month, President Trump asked Parliament to build a wall on the us-mexico border

 The shutdown in the US has reached its 22nd day on Monday
 isse pehle raashtrapati bill clinton ke kaarykaal main hua sabase lanbaa shatdown 21 dinon tak chalaa tha

 lekin usee din bina selary ke kaam karne se manaa karte hue white house kichen ke shef chuttee par chale gaye
 In this situation, President Trump ordered pizza, burgers and french fries in the White House dining room, ordering fastfood for the guests
 khaas baat yah he ki raashtrapati trump ne yah order apane paise se mangaya or iske liye koi bill white house main nahin lagaaya
 In the US, too, the chief of the central bank does not listen to Donald Trump! Donald Trump, while contesting for the presidency, promised that if elected, he would limit the entry of illegal entry into the US from neighboring Mexico
 But we will build the wall

 Before the Lok Sabha elections, the Narendra Modi government is going to give a big deal to the farmers
 kisaanon ko sarkaar ab kheti ke liye har sijan main chaar hajaar rupye prati acre kii dar se aarthik madad degi
 This money will be sent directly to their bank accounts
 iske saath hi sarkaar kisaanon ko ek lakh tak byajmukt lone degi
 According to Business Today sources, it could be announced this week
 sarkaar par iskaa bhaar salanaa kareeb 2
 30 lakh crores
 isamen 70 hajaar karod kii khaad sabsidi samet anya choti skiimon ko bhi shaamil kiya ja saktaa he
 After the defeat in three states, the Modi government is more concerned about the farmers
 2019 main phir se satta main vaapasi ke liye sarkaar ne kisaanon ko badi saugaaten dene kaa faisla liya he
 To finalize its decision, the government has convened quick meetings in the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) as well as the NITI Aayog
 mana ja rahaa he ki is faisle kaa elaan isi hafte ho saktaa he
 In this episode, officials of nodal ministries including Revenue, Expenditure, Chemicals and Fertilizers, Food have been asked to meet informally
 is faisle ke elaan se pehle piem narendra modi khud kisaan netaaon se mulaakaat kar rahe hai
 Sources told Business Today that farmers will be sent financial assistance directly to their bank accounts at the rate of Rs 4,000 per acre
 byajmukt fasal lone kii seemaa ko 50,000 rupee prati hectare se badhaakar ek lakh rupye tak prati kisaan kar diya jayega
 Till now, farmers used to get crop loans at a subsidy rate of 4 percent interest rate
 yojana ke tahat, bank 1 lakh rupee tak ke rin par koi byaaj nahin lenge
 The Center had set an agricultural credit target of Rs 10 lakh crore in 2017-18, which was achieved
 isamen se 70 fisadi fasal rin ke rup main baanta gaya he
 In the midst of the debt waiver, many banks have stopped giving loans to farmers
 adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki nai yojana kisaanon ke liye raste kholegi or upaj ko paidaa karne main kam laagat aayega, lekin badhate bed lone chintaa kaa vishay bane hue hai
 Banks have about 3 lakh crore bad loans in the agricultural sector
 nae saal ke pehle din die apane intervyuu main piem narendra modi ne kaha tha ki kisaanon kii sthiti sudhaarney ke liye karjamaafee vikalp nahin he
 Debt waiver was done in previous governments, but even today farmers are troubled by debt
 aise main kisaanon kii sthiti buniyadi samasyaon ke samaadhaan ke baad hi sudharegi
 In this case, PM Modi has asked the officials to bring the plan immediately
 sarkaar kii ore se laai ja rahi nai yojana main sidhe kisaanon ke khate main aarthik madad bheja jayega
 For this, farmers will have to provide some important data such as time to sell the produce, details of the buyer, its Aadhaar card, quantity of crop, details of land, etc
 in sabhi data ko fasal kii bikri ke samay ikattha kiya jayega
 This central government scheme will be different from the Telangana government
 telugana main kisaanon ko fasal ke sijan se pehle hi 4000 rupye prati acre mil jate hai

 Let's know which are the 7 things that should be avoided in this season
 hari subjiyan-barsaat main paalak, maithi, bathua, bangan, gobhi, patta gobhi jaisi subjiyan khaane se parhez karnaa chahie
 If we believe the hidden scientific reason behind this, the fertility of insects increases in the rain
 patteydaar subjiyon ke bich keede-makode teji se panpane lagate hai
 Consuming them can cause stomach upset, so avoid these vegetables in this season
 machhlee-monsoon machhlee yaa phir anya samudri jeevon ke liye prajnan kaa samay hota he
 This is the reason that eating fish in this season can increase the risk of food poisoning
 iske alaava barish ke mausam main pani pradooshit hone se machhliyon ke upar gandagi jamaa ho jaati he
 In such a situation, taking these fish can cause health damage
 mashroom-barsaat ke mausam main mashroom ke seven se bhi parhez karnaa chahie kyonki ise khaane se infections hone kaa khatra bana rahata he
 Avoid Tala Bhuna Khan- Avoid eating fried rice during the rainy season
 is tarah kaa bhojan sharir main pravesh karke pitt badhaata he
 To avoid this, avoid eating fried fried food
 salad se bhi banaaen duuri-aapako sunakar hairaani ho rahi hogi ki sehat ke liye phydemand kahe jane vaale salad ko bhi is mausam main kyon nahin khaanaa chahie
 Actually, not only salads, avoid eating anything raw during the rainy season
 iske alaava kate hue rakhe fal or subjiyon kaa bhi seven na karen kyonki inamen bhi keede hone kaa khatra rahata he
 Avoid eating non-veg- Our digestive system becomes very weak during the rainy season, so it is difficult to digest heavy food
 aise main is mausam main nonvej khaane se bachein
 Outdoor spicy spicy food - In this season, people often have a fondness of eating spicy and spicy
 log swaad ko puraa karne ke liye sadak kinare milane vaali chaat khaane lagate hai
 According to the doctors, fruits or any other food items kept in the open anytime during the rainy season can harm your health
