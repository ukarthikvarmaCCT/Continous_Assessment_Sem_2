 There is nothing wrong in this

 They are not outsiders
 isamen darane jaisaa kuch nahin he
 But how to arrange their living is a big question and we should think about it

 The spark of the Red Terror erupted in the 1940s, the fire of the Red Terror that rocked an area of west Bengal forty years ago, the way to get out of those flames of terror is not clear to 9 states today
 naksal or maowad kii bhatthi se nikali hinsa or badlaav ke liye khooni kranti kaa naaraa andhra pradesh ke 16 jilon se aage badhkar pados ke maharashtra or urisa main paanv jamaa chukaa he
 The red cavalcade of Naxalite violence that has become the headache of the government goes further in Chhattisgarh

 How many innocent tribals were killed in Balaghat? suraksha balon kii banduukon ko chakma dekar laal kranti kaa raag alaapne waalon ke liye jharkhand main red coridor bananaa zyada aasaan rahaa
 Naxalite seed was planted in West Bengal and this bloody tree is bleeding in 9 states
 naa police kii goli kaa asar, naa hukmaranon kii boli kaa
 The road to Naxalism has cleared 22 districts of Bihar via Jharkhand and Bengal
 sansadeey loktantr ke virodh ke naam khun kaa chaska naksali munh ko aisa laga ki uttar pradesh ke kuch ilaake isaki chapet main aa gayi
 The fire of Naxalite violence in the dense forests of Chhattisgarh has increased the political mercury of Delhi and Raipur
 alam ye he ki dilli se nikle saare raste chhattisgarh kii rajdhani raipur or vahaan ke naksal prabhavit ilaakon kii taraf hi ja rahe hai
 But the question is what is the background of this bloody game of Naxalites
 salwa judum ne naksal kii aag ko or bhadakaayaa25 may ko hue naksali or maovadi hamale ne puure desh ko hilaakar rakh diya
 Naxalites gunned down many big leaders of Chhattisgarh Congress
 lekin salwa judum ke sutaradhar rahe mahendra karma kii barbar hatya or phir unki laash par gum-ghumkar naachna ye bataane ke liye kaaphi he ki naksal kii aag ko kaise salwa judum ne bhadakaayaa
 In 2005, Mahendra Karma, the then leader of the opposition, on the initiative of the Chhattisgarh government, created the Salwa Judum, or the Shanti Yatra
 soobe ke bastar, sukama or dantewada jile ke sthaneey adivaasiyon ko sarkaar kii taraf se hathiyaar mili or baqayada sarkari sangrakshan
 According to a news, 42 thousand special police officers were deployed in it
 lekin bandook kii nalee se nikalne vaali ye shanti yatra apane mukaam tak nahin pahunchi
 The Supreme Court itself declared it illegal and unconstitutional in 2011
 lekin apni adaalat or apana kanoon chalaane vaale naksaliyon ke liye civil sosayadi kaa dakhal manjuur nahin
 In this battle of government and Naxalites, the tribals who keep themselves attached to nature
 bacchiyon kii tarah hi us din bhi adivasee ladkiyaan bijakhand puja kar rahi thim, jab suraksha balon kii goliyon ne 8 begunaah jindagiyon ko maut main badal diya
 They love their jungle-land
 iske liye ye hathiyaar bhi nahin uthaate, lekin hathiyaar uthaane waalon kii goliyaan inke seene ko baar-baar chalni karti hai
 In the name of Naxalites
 usee naksal ke pairon ke laal nishaan ko tatolte hue ajtak ja pahunchaa andhra pradesh ke aadilabad main, jo naksaliyon kaa ek bada garh he
 There are 16 districts of Andhra Pradesh - Anantapur, Adilabad, East Godavari, Guntur, Karimnagar, Khammam, Kurnool, Medak, Mahbubnagar, Nalgonda, Prakasam, Srikakulam, Visakhapatnam, Vizianagaram, Warangal and Nizamabad, where Naxalite guns are the threat of red terror in the forests She narrates
 maharashtra ke chaar jile chandanpur, gatchiroli, gondia or aheri main naksaliyon kaa asar dekha ja saktaa he
 The first Naxalite session was held in Kamalapur in Gadchiroli district in 1984
 29 saal main ye andolan vichaaron ke laal rang se zyada begunaahon ke laal khun se lathpath he
 From here, the terrorists get help from Andhra Pradesh to Chhattisgarh and then to Orissa
 aaj se nahin, tees saal se
 In Orissa, 19 districts are breathing under Naxalite orders
 gajpati, ganjam, kyonjhar, koraput, malkanagiri, mayurbhanj, navrangpur, raigarh, sanbhalpur, sundargarh, nayagarh, kandhamal, devgarh, jaipur, dhenkanal, kalahandi, nuapada, bargarh or bolangir
 The green belt of Dandakaranya is sometimes bloodied by the blood of tribals, sometimes Naxalites and security forces
 khaadi waalon ke khun par matam manaane vaale to bahut hai, lekin maasoom adivaasiyon kaa dard naksali dar ke saaye main sisakkar rah jaataa he
 In Chhattisgarh, 16 districts are dyed Naxalites
 bastar, bijapur, dantewada, jashpur, kanker, korea, narayanpur, rajanandgaanv, sarguja, dhamtari, mahasamund, gariyaaband baloud, sukama, kondagaanv or balrampur
 Here the whole Naxalite command of Bastar is with Ramanna alias Rowla, Srinivas and Ganesh Uike
 bastar main teen dashak se naksalwad kii samasya he
 It is said that wherever there is no development, roads do not reach
 naksal vaad ke bare main log bolne ko taiyaar nahin hai
 Cricket also came here in the changing times, but children are also playing the traditional game of clamshells
 ye jane bagaiyr ki inaki jindagi kodiyon ke mol bhi nahin he
 The area of jagrgunda and Abujmad of Bastar has been the stronghold of Naxalites
 madhya pradeshdur dur tak jangal hi jangal
 Called the capital of Dandakaranya, it is the Balaghat district of Madhya Pradesh
 empi kaa sabase zyada naksalgrast ilaaka
 Madhya Pradesh is undoubtedly under Shivraj Singh's government, but in fact, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra - a parallel government of Naxalites runs in Balaghat, which borders the three states
 naksali aadesh kii nafarmani manjuur nahinsarkari aadesh kii nafarmani to yahaan ho sakati he lekin naksaliyon ke aadesh ko nakaarne kaa matlab he maut
 Naxalites play blood Holi here whenever they want
 digvijay singh ke shashan ke dauraan parivahan mantri rahe likhiram kaaware ko bhi yahaan naksaliyon ne maut ke ghat utaar diya tha
 However, despite the danger, Aaj Tak's team took stock of the area
 naksalwad ke bare main ek aam dharna he ki ye adivaasiyon ko haq dilaane kii ladaai he
 But Aaj Tak came here and found that the nature of Naxalism has changed
 naksalwad ke naam par ilaake se guzarane vaali bason, jangal main kaam karne vaale mazdooron or khadaan maalikon se vasuuli ho rahi he
 Manganese and copper deposits are in the area
 lekin, khadaan maalikon se motaa paisa lekar naksali adivasee hakon se aankh munde hue hai
 There is a lot of problem of unemployed here
 yahaan tamba kii maatra bahut he, yahaan industry lag sakati he
 But the Naxalites are not allowing the development here to threaten the industrialists
 yahi vajah he ki ek bada tabaka naksaliyon ko aatankwaadi maanane laga he
 The wilderness between the jungle and the mountain has taken form in 9 states and the scare of the red terror spread in 7 states is very dangerous
 andhra pradesh, maharashtra, chhattisgarh, madhya pradesh, jharkhand
 Naxalism on its knees started running like a marathon in Jharkhand
 belgaum-bedadak
 Neither the worry of people's lives, nor the fear of the power of administration
 jharkhand main kai aise ilaake hai, jahaan raat to chhodie, din main bhi police jane se kataraati he
 Naxalites in the pegs with a population of five lakhs, made their pegs such that 2000 soldiers of Cobra and CRPF were also insufficient
 prakritik sansadhano se bharpoor is soobe kii badakismati dekhie ki yahaan ke 24 jilon main se 21 main naksal kaa laal ghoda daud rahaa he
 Such influence of Naxalites in Bokaro, Chatra, Dhanbad, East Singhbhum, Garhwa, Giridih, Gumla, Hazaribagh, Koderma, Latehar, Lohardagga, Palamu, Ranchi, Simdega, saraikela-kharsawan, West Singhbhum, Khunti, Ramgarh, Dumka, Deoghar and Pakur That is, the administration gets dwarfed
 rajdhani ranchi se mahaj 60 kilometre dur khunti main logon kaa dard unki jubaan pe ubhar aata he
 The forest dwellers are also scared of Maoism violence
 chhattisgarh main 25 may ko congressi netaaon par hue hamale ke baad naksaliyon kii taraf se nai-puraani maangen phir se uthne lageen
 Naxalites want Operation Green Hunt to be stopped
 jangalon se ardhsainik balon ko sarkaar waapas bula le
 The government should release those Naxalites in jails, which the Maoism activists call innocent tribals
 saath hi naksal virdohi kanoon khatm hon
 They also want that the spoils of natural resources created by the corporate world, be eliminated
 1970 ke dashak main naksalbadi se paidaa hua naksal andolan jar-jangal-jameen kii ladaai par aage badha
 a spark emanating from a village gradually ignited Maoism in more or less 16 states
 bengal kaa dard aaj bhi tis rahaa he
 Naxalites continue to dominate the four districts of West Bengal, Bankura, West Midnapore, Purulia and Birbhum
 bengal se nikalakar duusare rajyon main naksalwad failaa-phula, to iske peeche kai kaaran hai
 Naxalites have set foot in those states, where the number of tribals is more
 -jahaan zyaadaatar ilaake jangal or pahaad hai
 - The area is full of rich mineral substances
 -jo ilaake rajyon kii rajdhaniyon or jila mukhyalayon se dur hai
 -and the areas that connect the borders of many states
 lekin in sabase alag gaiyr-barabari ke khilaaf sangharsh kii ummid ne bhi naksalwadi hinsa ko badhaava diya
 Naxalism increased with politics on its back
 bihar ke 22 jilon main naksalwad pair pasaar chukaa he
 These districts are - Arwal, Aurangabad, Bhojpur, East Champaran, Gaya, Jamui, Jehanabad, Kaimur, Munger, Nalanda, Nawada, Patna, Rohtas, Sitamarhi, West Champaran, Muzaffarpur, Shivhar, Vaishali, Banka, Lakhisarai, Begusarai and Khagaria
 lekin badale halaat main jo naksalwad ke sataae hue hai, wo bhi or jo kabhi naksalwad ke pairokaar rahe, wo bhi maanate hai ki naksali apane raste se bhatak gaye
 Three districts of Uttar Pradesh - Chandauli, Mirzapur and Sonbhadra - have the effect of red terror
 lekin sawaal he ki kya tirupati se pashupati tak naksalwad kii red coridor ko todaa kaise jayega
 For how long will the country keep mourning the Red Terror as a cowardly act? When will the country continue to ignore a big problem by taking a resolve to fight Naxalism? On May 25, the Maoists committed such a massacre in Bastar district, but the government had nothing in the name of the action plan
 rajnath singh jis comprihensive plan kii baat kar rahe hai wo kaary yojana kya ho? kya vahi yojana jiskaa ishaara kendriya mantri jairam ramesh kar rahe hai
 But history has told that the use of Kameshwar Baitha has not been very effective because the ideology on which the Naxalite movement was built has lost its way in three decades
 wo afasaron or thekedaaron se rangadari tex vasuulate hai
 Instead, they keep their eyes closed by the exploitation of the tribals
 naksal or maowad ke naam par bandook uthaane vaale sansadeey loktantr kaa virodh karte hai
 But the last time a Naxalite named Kameshwar Baitha came to Parliament
 jabaki vidhansabhaon or jila panchayaton main to inkaa dakhal pehle se he
 Now the question is that between the opposition and support of parliamentary democracy, which way do the Naxalites want to rule
 lekin samasya naksaliyon ke str par he to dikkat sarkari soch main bhi he
 More people sitting in government do not know what is the real problem? After all, why the innocent tribals were forced to take up arms
 aakhir 71,000 siarpief jawan or sthaneey police kaa baari dasta kyon nahin bandook ke bal par is laal khatre ko khatm kar paaya he
 Naikya Naxalism has taken the form of terrorism? Has the Naxalite movement become hijacked by the tribals? After all, how will the Red Terror be curbed? If the government really wants to end Naxalism, first of all it will have to honestly believe that the problem is not with the Maoists but with the tribals
 ye samasya vikaas ke us model kii he, jisamen garib adivaasiyon ke hisse badahaali ke sivaa kuch nahin aata
 It is another matter that a lot of money is sent in the budget in his name
 yani vikaas or baatcheet hi samasya kaa hal ho saktaa he
 Government schemes have been in operation for decades to bring tribals into the mainstream
 11veen yojana main hi naksal prabhavit suubon main buniyadi dhaanche ke vikaas ke liye paanch sau karod kaa bajet paas hua he
 For decades, the government has spent hundreds of crores of rupees in these areas for all the needs of road, security, water, school life
 lekin vidambnaa dekhiye bastar kii badi aabaadi bagaiyr bijli or shauchalay ke rahati he
 Miles walks to the hospital and is still dependent on Naxalites for drugs
 aakhir sara paisa kahaan ja rahaa he? ye bataane vaala koi nahin
 This is the reason why people who are sympathetic to Naxalism clearly say that strengthen the security lacquer, the problem will not be solved
 ilaake kaa vikaas karo
 Interact with Naxalites
 lekin, pichley saal sukama ke dm ke apharan ke dauraan sarkaar or naksaliyon ke bich baatcheet kii madhyasthata kar chuke professor hargopal sarkaar kii eemaandaaree par ungali uthaate hai
 Hargopal says that the government turns back on the promise as soon as the work is finished, in such a situation, who will come forward for talks? It is clear that after every major incident, the government tries but then takes steps
 yahi vajah he naksalwad kaa rog ab nasoor se cancer ban gaya he
 In 1980, then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi sent a team for the first time to solve the Naxal problem in Andhra Pradesh and Bihar
 us team kii aguwai kar rahe the us vakt yojana ayog ke sadsy sachiv
 The same member secretary is the Prime Minister of the country today, but in three decades this disease has become cancerous from canker and if there is anything in the name of its treatment, then the same old promises and countless teams

 The head of All India majlis-e-ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) and Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi on Saturday targeted Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath over the deteriorating law and order in the state
 ovaisi ne kaha ki uttar pradesh sarkaar ko rajya main kanoon vyavastha sunishchit karne par dhyaan dena chahie
 At the same time, he said on Yogi's statement about the economy that the Indian economy grew rapidly in the Mughal era, but it was completely destroyed by the British
 bataa den,mumbai main chal rahe teen divasiy vishwa hindu aarthik manch se siem yogi adityanath ne girti arthvyavastha ke liye mughalon or angrejon ko jimmedaar tehraaya tha
 On this same statement of the Chief Minister, Owaisi said, 'yogi Adityanath has once again proved that he has no knowledge about anything
 yah sirf unka saubhaahgya he ki vah desh ke sabase bade rajya ke mukhyamantri he
 It tells us the history, if the Chief Minister had read the history, how fast the Indian economy grew during the time of the Mughals
 jahangir ke shasankaal main to vishwa kii jidipi main bharat kaa yogadan 25 pratishat tha
 Owaisi then quoted an international economist as saying, "this continued till Aurangzeb
" aurangzeb ke shasankaal main bharat ne china kii arthvyavastha ko bhi pachhad diya tha
 Owaisi accused Yogi Adityanath that he hates doing anything better for Muslims, but this cannot change history
 haalanki iske saath hi ovaisi ne kaha ki vah sweekaar karte hai ki british shashan ke dauraan arthvyavastha 'puri tarah se tabah' ho gai thi, lekin unhone daawa kiya ki yah mughal shashan main iske ulat thi

 But when it comes to general knowledge, book writing, this cannot be done at all

 The BJP is celebrating the birth centenary year of its Yugpurushdeendayal Upadhyay with full fervor these days
 is avasar par kai yojanaayen or kaarykram dinadayal upaadhyaay ko samarpit karte hue chalaae ja rahe hai
 The slogan of Integral Humanism and Antyodaya is being presented by connecting them
 unke naam par smarakon or sansthaanon ke namakaran kii bhi hode he
 In this direction, the Uttar Pradesh unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party had also constituted Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya Birth Centenary Celebration Committee, which is organizing various programs related to Deendayal Upadhyaya among different sections of the society
 khud tatkaaleen pradesh bhaajapa adhyaksh keshav prasad maury is samiti kaa jimmaa sanbhale hue the
 Many more BJP leaders are involved in this
 isi samiti kii ore se saamaanya gyaan pratiyogita kaa aayojan bhi kiya gaya he
 For this, a booklet called General Knowledge Competition 2017 has also been published
 lakhon kii sankhya main yah pustika bacchon ko sarkari or gair-sarkari skulon main banti gai he
 Many things related to the history of India are mentioned in this book of general knowledge
 is pustika ke aadhaar par pratiyogitaaon kaa aayojan kiya ja rahaa he
 What is missing is Mahatma Gandhi, Nehru, there is a chapter of general knowledge on page number 34 in this 70-page booklet
 sheershak he- bharat main pratham
 And it mentions the names of the first President, Governor General, Vice President, Lok Sabha Speaker, Deputy Prime Minister etc
 of India
 haa, na to is suchi main nehru kaa naam shaamil he or na hi yah zaruri samajha gaya he ki bharat ke pratham pradhanmantri kaa zikr is pustak kiya jaae
 Moreover, the first woman Prime Minister of India is not even mentioned in this chapter
 haalanki bharat kii pehali mahila mukhyamantri ke rup main sucheta kriplani ko to jagah mili he
 But the first identity of Nehru and Indira is missing from this booklet
 haa, bharat ratna se sammanit pratham mahila ke rup main indira gandhi ko is suchi main shaamil kiya gaya he
 And it has also been reported that Morarji Desai was the first Prime Minister to resign from the post of Prime Minister
 pej number 7 par hamaare mahapurush sheershak se ek chapter he
 It has names of Swami Vivekananda, Bhimrao Ambedkar, Guru Govind Singh, Birsa Munda, Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, Nanaji Deshmukh, Madan Mohan Malviya, Dr
 Hedgewar, Veer Savarkar, Kabir Das, Patel and Lakshmibai in the list of great men
 mahatma gandhi kaa zikratak is suchi main nahin aata
 Nor is Mahatma Gandhi mentioned as the Father of the Nation anywhere in the entire booklet
 pej number 39 par ek kollam he- kisne kya kaha
 And from here also Nehru's name is missing
 itihaas purush ke taur par isamen mahatma gandhi, tilak, shastri ke alaava shyaam laal gupta, bose or dayanand ke naam hai
 This list goes further where Yudhishthira and Duryodhana are also included in the great men
 saath hi veda vyas, chanakya niti, panchatantr or jataka katha ke bhi kathan shaamil hai
 History of the facility is the first point in what is told on the page number 41 titled Economic scenario - in which year the Planning Commission has been abolished by the Government of India
 doosraa or teesraa bindu niti ayog par he
 Further points include rss's subsidiary organization Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh as India's largest trade union
 aage kaa saamaanya gyaan puri tarah se modimay he
 The first point under the title equal-current Affairs says - Who gave the slogan of Make in India? Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 or phir aage kaa saamaanya gyaan modi sarkaar kii yojanaon ke naamon par kendrit he
 The booklet gives general knowledge about the constitution and states which countries have been included in this constitution
 yah bhi ki bharat kaa samvidhan main vidhi nirmaan kii prakriya ko britain ke samvidhan ke samaan rakhaa gaya he
 This shows that the Indian Constitution is less ours and more of foreign influence
 uttar pradesh ke itihaas kii charchaa karte hue pustika bataati he ki varanasi shahar bhagwaan shiv ke trishul par sthit he
 It is also worth noting that while talking about the history of India, the list of Prime Ministers of independent India is not included in this booklet
 na hi uttar pradesh ke abtak ke mukhyamantriyon kii suchi ko hi is pustika main shaamil kiya gaya he
 (click here to read this news in English) rajasthan main 15veen vidhansabha kaa doosraa satr guuruuvaar se shuru ho rahaa he

 chif justise ke master of roster par sawaal uthaane vaali shanti bhushan kii yachika par shuukravaar ko sunwaayee hogi
 The Bench of Justice AK Sikri and Justice Ashok Bhushan will be heard on this petition, which holds the role of Chief Justice
 is yachika ke bare main ajtak ke saath khaas baatcheet karte hue yachikakarta ke vakil prashanth bhushan ne bataaya ki samvidhan main master of roster kaa matlab manamaani of roster katai nahin he
 Our petition is also to make the roster's mastership clear, transparent and regular
 lekin ye anubhav system se ladane jaisaa tha
 The Tosupreme Court's Registry did not accept our petition weeks ago because the CJI was made a party to it
 ab jab CJI ke adhikaar kshetra ko niyamit karne kaa mudda ho to pakshakaar banaae bina kaise hoga
 If this issue was solved with great difficulty, then the problem came that how should we take this case challenging the jurisdiction of the Chief Justice in his back
 kaayade se ise chif justise ko sunanaa bhi nahin chahie
 Thinking this, we went to Justice Chelameswar's court and requested to hear the case
 justise chelameshwar ne maamle kii sunwaayee se ye kehete hue inkaar kiya ki wo nahin chaahate ki 24 ghante ke bheetar pehle kii tarah unka aadesh ulat diya jaae
 i am retiring after two months
 prashanth bhushan se kaha ki justise chelameshwar ne apane bare main kii ja rahi charchaa kaa zikr bhi kiya
 He said that it is being said to me that i am doing this to grab an office, but it is not true
 agar kisi ko chintaa nahin he to main bhi zyada chintaa nahin karuunga
 Looking at the history of the country, i obviously will not listen to this case
 iske baad prashanth bhushan ne is maamle ko chif justise kii court main mension kiya
 The Chief Justice consulted his fellow Justices Khanwilkar and Justice Chandrachud in the Bench
 phir chif justise ne kaha ki wo is bare main dekhenge
 By the evening, the bench was fixed
 vaise bhushan kii is yachika main kaha gaya he ki supreme court main keson kaa aavanton chif justise akele nahin balki collegium main shaamil sabhi paanch jaj karen
 Prashant Bhushan said that four judges of the same Supreme Court held a press conference against the arbitrariness of the Chief Justice
 masalaa puri tarah hal nahin hua to ye yachika daayar kerani padi
 Let us know that the 4 sitting judges of the Supreme Court, Justice Chelameswar, Justice Ranjan Gogoi, Justice Madan Lokur and Justice Kurian Joseph had said in a press conference that the administration of the Supreme Court is not working properly, if this continues then the democratic situation Will not be right unhone kaha ki hamane is mudde par chif justise se baat kii, lekin unhone hamaari baat nahin suni
 Apart from this, recently, Justice Chelameswar had said that if after CJI Deepak Mishra, if Justice Ranjan Gogoi is not made CJI, then what we said was correct
 aapako bataa den ki justise chelmeshwar 22 june ko ritair ho rahe hai to vahiin deepak mishra oktober ke maheene main ritair honge
 If you have even the smallest problem related to sleep then immediately pay attention to it and seek the opinion of the doctor
 neend se sambandhit choti se choti samasyake prati udaseenta se doctor bachane kii raay dete hai
 Doctors say that one third of humans have some of the 80 apparently sleep disorders, some of which can be very harmful
 lekin sabase acchhee baat he ki iskaa ilaaj bhi hamaare haath main hi he
 Dr Sanjay Manchanda, chairman of the sleep medicine department and the country's top neurologist at Sir Gangaram Hospital in New Delhi, warned, "your health depends on your sleep pattern
" yah hamaare jivan kaa aisa hissaa he jisamen ham samjhauta nahin kar sakate
 So do not take sleep related disorder carelessly

 Gunner, a six-year-old child, suddenly became depressed when his parents told him that he was going to have a daughter and another sister would come to him
 bachche ne is khabar ko sunakar itnaa druma kiya ki drama internet par viral ho gaya
 Something happened that Gunner's parents came home with a white colored cake and told the children that another young child was coming to their house
 kek kaatane ke baad uske andar se nikalne vaale rang se pataa chalegaa ki vah ladkaa he yaa ladki
 The excited gunner cut the white cake and pink cream came out of it, which he started crying so much that he could not handle anyone
 darasal, ganar kii pehle se hi do choti bahanen hai or jab usne teesri bahan hone kii baat suni to vah foot-footkar rone laga
 Seeing the pink cream of the cake, he started looking at his parents and said, 'pink colored cream has come out of the cake, that means there will be a sister
 mujhe ladkiyaan bilkul pasand nahin he
 'and he started crying after saying this, his two younger sisters also started laughing at him
 uskaa drama rone bhar se hi khatm nahin hua, vah teble par jo-jor se haath-pair chalaane laga
 The crying gunner said, 'I will not eat this cake, a girl is coming to the house again
 main ye ghar chhodkar chalaa jaaoongaa

 mujffarpur, bihar kaa shahi lichi bahut lajij hota he, lekin har varsh jab lichi kaa fal pedo par laal laal rang bikherta he tab ek beemaari bacchon par maut ban kar tuutati he
 Recently, research has been published in a famous magazine of America citing American scientists that these deaths have occurred due to eating litchi
 halaki mujffarpur ke doctor isse sahamat nahin he
 He says that the amount of glucose is not constant in the suffering children who come, not everyone has the same symptoms
 pichley saal lichi kaa fal aane se pehle hi bacchon kii mautein shuru ho gai thi
 Hundreds of Muzaffarpur children fall ill during the months of May and June and hundreds of children die due to mysterious illness
 har varsh garmi kaa mausam kahar ban kar aata he
 After three years of research, India and American scientists came to the conclusion that eating litchi on empty stomach is causing this suspected disease in children
 vaigyanikon ke mutabik lichi main hipoglicin e or mithailansaiclopropilgisin naam kaa jaharila tatv hota he
 a test of blood and urine of most of the children admitted to the hospital revealed that they contained quantities of these elements
 zyaadaatar bacchon ne shaam kaa bhojan nahi kiya tha or subah zyada maatra main lichi khai
 In such a situation, the effect of these elements is fatal
 bacchon main kuposhan or pehle se biimaar hone kii vajah se is beemaari kaa khatra bad jaataa he
 After this research of scientists has been published, skmch's pediatrician Dr
 Gopal Shankar Sahni has rejected it from one end
 doctor gopal shankar sahani apane anubhav ke aadhaar par bataate hai ki jo peedit bachche aate hai unamem glucose kii maatra sthir nahin rahati, koi bhi lakshan ek jaisaa nahin rahata
 Talking about litchi, some children came to the hospital last year before the fruit of litchi entered the tree and some even died
 doctoron kaa kahana he ki is beemaari se teen varsh se lekar 12 varsh ke bachche prabhavit hote hai
 Where will a 3 year old child eat litchi? jile ke civil sarjan doctor lalita singh ne bhi sahmati jataate hue kaha ki glucose level ghatane se grasit marij aate hai
 He also dismissed the cause of litchi
 2014 main is beemaari se 390 bachche grasit hue the usamen se 122 kii maut ho gai
 When this disease comes, the leaders visit, teams from all over the world come to do research
 research ke liye mujffarpur main neshnal centre for dijis control or america se centre for dijis control kii team beemaari ke dauraan ai or un ilaakon main bhi research bhi kiya
 The government kept changing the name of the disease, first of all, meningitis and then hypoglycemia and then acute encephalitis syndrome, but the tight reality is that the disease could not be detected and the death of children continued
 halaki bharat sarkaar ne is shodh ko pramanit maanate hue nirdesh bhi jari kiya he ki khaali pet lichi kaa khaane se parhez kare or santulit bhojan le

 Taking a dig at the Chief Minister of Gujarat, Rahul Gandhi today said that modi-adani has replaced the vajpayee-advani partnership
 rahul ne yahaan ek raily ko sambodhit karte hue kaha ki modi ne maharashtra ke aurangabad ke aakaar kii jameen ek rupee prati varg meter kii dar se mahaj 300 karod rupee main adani ko de di
 The Congress vice-president said, 'today, Adani ji (in Gujarat) is ruling
 isse pehle vaajapeyi ji - adwani ji kii saajhedaari hua karti thi
 And it is a toffee model
 ' He said that earlier there used to be Advani ji
 yadi aap adwani ke angreji varna vinyas se ‘ve’ akshar hataa den to yah adani ho jayega
 Rahul explained the reason for describing Gujarat model as' Toffee Model 'and said,' In Gujarat, land was given to Adaniji at the rate of Re 1 per square meter
 ek rupee main aap ek toffee bhi kharidte hai
 That is why i said that it is not the Gujarat model, but the 'toffee model' of development
 is tarah kii tippaniyon par modi ke palatwaar kiye jane ke baad rahul ne ‘toffee model’ kaa tanj aaj phir se ksaa
 Rahul alleged that 40 lakh people in Gujarat are below the poverty line and living in difficult conditions, while Modi is benefiting some industrialists like Adani
 unhone aarope lagaaya, 'toffee model ke netaa modi ji ne ek udyogpati ko 45,000 acre jameen di

 hamid dhire se poochta, kahaan chale jaaen
 Premchand did not have any answer to this matter, so he would get abused
 hamid aksar badbadaata rahata he, vah kya kahana chahta he, na kah paata he or na koi samaj paata he
 Hamid, who had received wounds from his neighbors, knew every man
 kyonki ye log to vahi log the, jo hamid se chimate, andey or shakkar lete the
 Less cash, more borrowings
 jo ab kabhi hamid nahin maang paaegaa
 In his farm, Hamid's children and grandchildren grew sugarcane or worked in a sugar mill
 shartiya koi bhi aadmi bahari nahin tha
 Because when the honor of the girls and women was being looted in Hamid's house, she was making a vow to spare herself by saying 'bhaijaan - Bhaijaan', but her plans were made of iron and were not ready to be soft

 i said, "I do not mess with any man, what are you saying to this state and country
" iske baad govinda ne kaha ki meri mummy ne phixd chijen kah di hai
 "he told that his mother wanted him to continue playing characters with laughing smiles and dancing so that people would feel that Govind was standing
 maaloom ho ki govinda ne zyaadaatar filmein aisi hi kii hai
 Govinda told about the film Gadar that he had a lot of abuses which he cannot even discus on the show
 iske baad govinda ne bataaya ki diarector sanjay lila bhansaali ne unhen devdas main chunni laal kaa role ofer kiya gaya tha lekin unhone use bhi manaa kar diya kar diya tha
 The reason behind this was that he did not want to roll the side

 govinda ne kaha, ''maine sanjay se poocha aapako mujhamen chunni laal kahaan dikhataa he? main us samay superstar tha
 i thought, you are the director of the top, good thing, but why are you giving me the character role
 maine kaha ek kaam karnaa, shahrukh se kaho ki wo mujhe kahe
 i can do this film for friendship but not for anything else
 main isliye film nahin karuunga kyonki aap ek star yaa phir top diarector ho
 i like Shah Rukh Khan very much
 hamane saath main film nahin kiya he lekin ve ek achche insaan hai
 '' View this post on Instagramdesigner credit: @rohinigugnani 📸: @shivamduaphotographya post shared bygovinda (@ govinda_herono1) onjul 4, 2019 at 3:34 am PDT However, rejecting the film did not make any difference to Govinda's career

 aap bhale hi apane baalo kii dekhbhaal ke liye har nuskhaa aajamaate hon lekin shaayad hi aapako kabhi wo saare upaay paryaapt lagate honge
 Everyone wishes that his hair is beautiful, shiny and soft
 baalo kii dekhbhaal ke liye ham kai tarah ke upaay apanaate hai or koshish karte hai ki baalo ke poshan main koi kami na rahe
 But the dilemma is that there is no single source of hair care
 ek insaan ke bal duusare ke baalo se bilkul alag hote hai
 The solution that works for one is not necessarily the same for the other
 baalo ko dhone se lekar unhen sanvaarane tak kii prakriya sabhi ke liye alag-alag hoti he
 Just as straight hair people think that it is good to have curly hair, similarly those with curly hair desire straight hair
 haalanki is baat main koi do raay nahin he ki ghunghraale baalo kii dekhbhaal karnaa ek behad mushkil kaam he
 While such a lot of patience is required for taking care of such hair, the trouble is doubled if the curls are very small
 agar aapke bal bhi ghugharale hai to aapke liye ye upaay behad kargar or phydemand sabit ho sakate hai:1
 Wash hair everyday
 There is no other option but to keep curly hair clean
 aise baalo ko saaf rakhana or bhi jaruri ho jaataa he kyonki gande hone par inke ulajhane kii ashanka bad jaati he
 In such a situation, try to wash your hair before it gets dirty
 2
 Oil is regularly applied to the hair
 In most cases, it is seen that curly hair is dry
 aise main unamem niyamit rup se tel lagaana bahut jaruri he
 Special care needs to be taken while applying oil on such hair because the oil in them does not reach the scalp easily and the hair does not get adequate nutrition
 aise main ghunghraale baalo ko niyamit rup se tel massage dete rahen
 3
 brush karne se bachenaise baalo main baar-baar brush karnaa sahi nahi he
 In straight hair, you can comb again and again, but combing repeatedly in curly hair can be harmful
 4
 Do not forget to apply hair pack, hair pack makes beautiful soft and shiny hair
 par agar aap behatar parinaam chaahate hai to baalo ko gharelu mask se poshit karnaa phydemand rahegaa
 This will reduce the loss of hair and make the hair beautiful
 5
 Use of conditioner is very important for the care of curly hair, you must use the conditioner after shampooing

 It is said that employment visa is needed
 ab jab ham imployament vija kaa intjaam karte hai to bhi shooting rukvane kii dhamkee dete hai
 They ask for money, but because of not giving, they create a ruckus on the set
 sairas ke mutabik aisa pichley do saal se chal rahaa he or hamaare log unhen haftaa dene ko majaboor hai
 Cyrus said that the same thing happened recently with Shah Rukh Khan during the shooting of an ad film in Mehboob Studios
 haalanki tab police ke aane par maamla sulajh gaya tha
 Otherwise, they do not let them work without taking money
 associyeshan kaa aarope he ki sirf raajnneetik union hi nahin, police vaale bhi pehle alag-alag parmishan or baad main rounssop ke naam par rupee vasuulate hai
 In a day's shooting, they have to pay 4 to 5 lakh rupees as a week

 ' Jia Khan did not commit suicide because of a sinking film career, but the truth is that an incomplete SMS was the reason for the death of Jia Khan
 mumbai police kii tafteesh ke mutabik somvaar raat nau baje tak jiya behad khush thi
 He had signed three films, but suddenly something happened at nine o'clock that Jia got angry and all this happened due to an incomplete SMS
 'I WILL MEET BETWEEN 10 TO 1' yahi wo esemes he jo adhuraa he or isi adhure esemes kii vajah se naa sirf jiya ko gussa aayaa balki uske or uske premi suraj pancholi ke bich ek aisi galatfahami paidaa hui jisane jiya kii jaan le lee
 It is written in this SMS that i will meet between ten to one, that is, i will meet you between ten to one
 ye esemes suraj pancholi kii paariwarik mitra nilu ne suraj pancholi ko somvaar din main bheja tha
 Now how is this SMS incomplete or is it necessary to understand why Jiah committed suicide due to this single SMS, you should understand the whole story from Monday morning till 11 pm i
e
 when Jiya committed suicide
 shanivaar or ravivaar ko zyaadaatar vakt ek saath bitaane ke baad somvaar subah saadhe nau baje jiya kaa premi suraj pancholi apane kaam par chalaa gaya tha
 Jia was at home
 iske baad dopaher baarah baje jiya ne suraj ko pehla esemes kiya
 Jia asked why ru so cold with me? That is why your behavior is so cold with me? Suraj replied buisy
 iske baad dopaher sava do baje jiya ne phir esemes kiya
 This time he wrote, we had a nice weekend, why ru so cold wid me, Suraj just wrote in response to this SMS he is in gym
 iske baad suraj shaam saat baje ghar pahunchaa or usne jiya ko kol kiya
 Jiya then told Suraj that he wanted to give you good news but you have been avoiding me since morning
 suraj ne poocha koun si good news? tab jiya kahati he ki mujhe teen nai pikchar mili he
 At this, Suraj said sorry while giving Jia congratulations
 phir phone rakhane ke baad suraj ne apane chaukeedaar ko ek hajaar rupye die or usase kaha ki wo ek guladasta kharid kar jiya ko uske ghar par de aae
 Then in the evening Suraj left for Hotel Novatel
 novatail main suraj ko karan or jhangiyaani naam ke do doston se milanaa tha
 Sooraj was still in the hotel when Jiah again called Suraj at nine o'clock
 jiya ne guladaste ke liye suraj ko thanks bolaa or poocha ki wo is vakt kahaan he? is par suraj ne bataaya ki wo hotel novatail main he or ab nilu se milane vaala he
 Jiya was angry with Suraj since Monday morning but the matter still did not deteriorate
 donon main baraabar baatcheet ho rahi thi par jaise hi suraj jiya ko bataata he ki ab wo nilu se milane ja rahaa he, usee ke baad kahani palat jaati he
 After this, Jia calls Neelu and then Jia gets infuriated by what Neelu tells her
 aakhir nilu ne jiya se aisa kya kah diya or ye nilu he koun
 At nine o'clock at night, Jia calls Neelu and asks Neelu whether she is going to meet Suraj yet
 isapar nilu bataati he ki nahin wo aaj nahin milane vaali he
 Jiya gets agitated on hearing this
 wo suraj kaa guladasta ghar se baahar phenk detii he or phir gusse main suraj ko kol karti he
 Jia fights over the fact that Suraj is deliberately avoids her
 wo kahati he ki tum nilu se kal milane vaale ho or mujhe kah rahe hon ki aaj milane vaale ho
 Suraj says that there has been some misunderstanding
 use aaj hi milanaa he
 After this, Sooraj disconnects the phone and mixes the phone with Neelu and asks that you have sms that you will meet between ten to one tonight
 isapar nilu kahati he ki ye massej kal raat das se ek baje milane ke liye tha aaj ke liye nahin
 Its eagle Suraj tells Neelu to please call Jia and clear this misunderstanding
 nilu jiya ko phone kar samajhaati bhi he par jiya kaa gussa kam nahin hota
 Jia suspected that Suraj was going to meet another girl by taking the name of Neelu
 iske baad suraj or jiya ke bich phir kai baar baat hoti he par jiya nahin maanati
 The last call was made by Suraj at 10
53 in the night and Jiah committed suicide between 7
00 am to 11:22 pm
 darasal 43 saal kii neelkamal urf nilu kii charani road par jewelri shop he
 Neelu makes jewelery of Suraj's mother
 jiya ne bhi nilu se kai baar jewelri banaai thi
 Hence Jia also knew Neelu
 kuch din pehle hi suraj ne nilu se sone kaa ek chen repere karaayaa tha or usee silsile main suraj ko nilu ko 16 hajaar rupye dene the
 To give this money, Suraj had to meet Neelu and Neelu had sent this message to Suraj, but he had written the time in the SMS but not the day and just because of this incomplete SMS, Jiya and Suraj fought and the result was doubt and Jia gave up her life due to anger
 police sutron ke mutabik ye sach he ki jiya apane filmi kariyar ko lekar utana khush nahin thi kyonki use kaam nahin mil rahaa tha
 Because of this, she used to live under stress too
 itnaa hi nahin kareeb saat maheene pehle bhi usne ek baar khudakushi kii koshish kii thi
 Then she had cut the vein of her hand from a broken bottle of liquor, but the police say that the girl who is giving the good news of getting three films in the evening can not commit suicide for a few hours after that
 yani maamla pyaar or shaq kaa hi he
 The doubt that an incomplete SMS created

 Pakistan's Finance Minister also cried sadly that India has submitted a separate assessment for how much Pakistan is following the recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF)
 unhone kaha ki growth model ke dhaanche, sansadhano ko jutaney, bachat dar badhaane, nivesh ko badhaava dene, naukariyon ke srijan or garibi hataane ke liye yojana banane main neshnal essembly ke finance kamity ko sakriy bhoomika nibhaani hogi
 Significantly, as of December 2018, the total external debt on Pakistan was $ 99 billion, which was 35 of its GDP
 8 fisadi he
 Pakistan's foreign exchange reserves are making this debt more dangerous because it has only a few billion dollars in foreign currency

 The historic local train of Mumbai completed its last journey from DC (direct Current)
 shanivaar raat 11 bajkar 30 minute par kurlaa se nikali ye train 12 bajkar 23 minute par chhatrapati shivaji terminus pahunchi
 This train was given farewell with singing and dancing at every station
 kurlaa se siasti ke bich jitne bhi stesan aae har stesan par alag najaara tha
 Somewhere the drum was drowned somewhere, Lavani somewhere and Bhangra, and somewhere with traditional music, DC Local was bid farewell
 kuch logon kii ankhen is train ke aakiri safar main nam bhi ho gayi
 In Mumbai, the trains of the Harbor line ran on DC till Saturday, while operations on Western and Central rail from DC had ceased long ago
 ab horbar line par bhi asi (alternet karant) se local trainon kaa parichaalan shuru ho gaya, jiske saath hi mumbai ke trek par disi se chalane vaali local itihaas ke pannon main samaa gai
 The comments bataa den, disi local 1500 volt par chalati thi, jabaki asi 25000 volt par
 Railways are also expected to increase the speed of trains, save time for passengers, and cut electricity bills
 horbar kii trainen asi se chalane ke baad unhen 9 dibbon se 12 dibbon kaa banane main bhi aasaani hogi
 Motorman was the last DC local charioteer of the railway
 is khaas local ke liye 10 hajaar rupye kii tikat rakhi gai thi, railway kamaaye paison ko sookhaa raahat ke liye dena chaahati thi, lekin iske liye na ke baraabar kharidaar mili
 Every station that came between Kurla to CST had a different view
 kahin dhol kahin nagaade, kahin laavni kahin bhangada, to kahin paaramparik sangeet ke saath disi local ko vidaai di gai
 Some people also got moist in the last journey of this train
 mumbai main horbar line kii trainen shanivaar tak disi par chalin, jabaki pashchimi or madhya rail par disi se parichaalan bahut pehle band ho chukaa tha
 Now the AC (alternate Current) local trains started operating on the Harbor Line, with which the DC track on the Mumbai track merged into the pages of local history
 tippaniyan Let me tell you, DC local used to run at 1500 volts, while AC at 25000 volts

 teen maheene pehle sarkaar main aisa ek bhi vyakti milanaa mushkil tha jo jiesti ko krantikari sudhaar na bataa rahaa ho
 The government ministers and BJP leaders were assuming that most of India's business is out of the tax net, at least through concessions and through more stringent GST, it would be made cleaner
 isse mahangaai kam hogi, sarkaar kii aamadani main ijapha hoga vikaas dar tej gati se aage bad sakegi
 This GST was the biggest tax reform in the history of the country on 1 July midnight
 teen maheene bitne ke baad jiesti apane sabhi buniyadi sudhaarwadi praavdhaanon ko chhod kar sar ke bal khadaa ho gaya
 The reason is not difficult to guess
 tex base se vot base zyada keemtee he
 The government was so scared of slipping land that changes were made in GST which were not needed
 jiesti ab puri tarah lunj punj he isse zyada tex ke alaava jo bhi pramukh sudhaar the ab waapas ho gaye hai

 What Does Change Mean? 1
 apni 22veen baithak main jiesti council ne do ahm badlaav kiye
 First, the exemption limit in composition scheme under GST was increased
 doosraa 1
 Businesses up to Rs 5 crore were allowed to file returns on a quarterly basis instead of filing returns per month
 2
 Monthly returns were the foundation of GST
 iske jariye kaarobaari bilon kii maiching honi thi
 Tax evasion was to be caught
 vyapaariyon kaa har kaam saaf suthra va bill par karne par baadhya kiya janaa tha or input tex credit kaa niyamit bhugtan hona tha
 3
 timahi ritern kii puraani vyavastha lautne ke baad is faisle se jiesti ke daayre main aane vaale lagbhag 90 fisadi kaarobaar masik monitoring se baahar ho gaye hai
 Now only 10% big businessmen will have to file returns on monthly basis
 isamen koi hairaani nahin hogi ki aage chalakar bache in 10 fisadi bade kaarobaar ko bhi masik ritern daakhil karne se chhot de di jaae kyonki jab unke saplir timahi ritern bharenge to inke liye masik ritern vyaavhaarik nahin rahenge
 4
 niyamit input texi credit kaa bhugtan ab mushkil dikhataa he jo kaarobaar kii laagat kam karne liye jaruri tha
 5
 i webill sahit anya jiesti praavdhaan bhi lambey samay ke taal diye gaye hai, jo kaarobaar ko paardarshee banane ke liye jaruri the
 6
 bajet main kam se kam saal main ek baar hi tex daren badalati thim
 The GST Council has changed the tax rates on products and services thrice in three months
 or chunavi dabaav main aage bhi badlaav ho sakate hai
 The uncertainty in tax rates has increased instead of volatility
 7
 Quarterly returns, composition schemes, turmoil in tax rates can further deteriorate the revenue of the Center and states
 in 5 sawaalon kaa jawaab kiske paas?jiesti jin mushkilon ke chalate badla gaya unhen laane vaale sabhi praavdhaan thik teen maheene pehle taiyaar hue the
 At that time, the government was being advised that these provisions should be discussed with industry and trade and there should be time for preparation, as has happened in other countries implementing GST
 1
 Why was the July 1 date fixed for the implementation of GST? While the central government could implement it with complete preparation by 15 September
 isse jiesti ke software ko durust karne or kaarobaariyon ko nae kar vyavastha main jane kii taiyaari ke liye adhik samay mil jaataa
 Who is responsible for the damage done to the economy of the country in three months? Read this also: Do not shed tears on 80, petrol will reach 100 rupees now! Understand mathematics 2 here
 yah jaanate hue ki jiestine kaa pareekshan nahin hua tha, iskaa shuruaati kaamkaaj santoshjanak nahin tha iske baad bhi jiestn aise 90 fisadi kaarobaariyon par thopa gaya jinaki digital sakshartaa behad kamjor he
 3
 jiesti lagu karne se udyog, vyapaar par padane vaale asar kaa asar desh kii arthvyavastha par padana sambhavit tha?4
 Why did the central government not prioritize reforming the tax structure under excise and VAT before implementing GST? 5
 petrol or dijal ko jiesti ke daayre main laane kaa jo gyaan ab upaj rahaa he use keval teen maah june main jiesti banaate samay kyon khaarij kiya gaya?jiesti ek bada or mahatvaypurna sudhaar tha
 The government lost it first in haste and later in electoral fear
 jiesti ke teen maah ke safar ab sudhaar nahi bachaa he keval shesh rah gaya he tex jo kai sevaaon or utpaadon par pehle se zyada he

 Muslim families demand that they will not return to their villages until the rioters are arrested
 vahiin, ballabhagarh main jat or muslim samudaay ke bich bulaai baithak kaa bhi koi nateeja nahin niklaa
 The Muslims have demanded that all the rioters should be arrested and at the same time sanctioned to build the mosque on the ground near the temple near Attali village
 duusari ore, ataali main hui jat kii baithak main unhone musalamaanon ko masjid ko ataali gaanv se baahar banane kaa prastaav diya or kaha ki vah puure nirmaan kaa kharch uthaaenge, lekin musalmaan or jat samudaay ne ekadusre ke prastaav ko maanane se saaf inkaar kar diya he
 Let us tell you that after a dispute between two sects in Atali village about the construction of the mosque a week ago, the people of the Muslim community have escaped and taken shelter in the Ballabhgarh police station premises

" dangaiyon ne hamaare ghar jala die, hamen lutaa or hamaari jindagi kharaab kar di or iske baad bhi ham logon ko hi samjhauta karne kii baat kahi ja rahi he
 When the court has said that the land belongs to us, why are we not being allowed to build mosques? ”sudhir Singh Chaudhary, a Jat farmer said,“ If the Muslim community returns to the village and the mosque is built near the temple, then Would be unnatural
 isse aage bhi hinsa hone kii ashanka he
 So how can this be good for the village? ' sena or ardhsainik balon ke javaanon ko muaavja or sammaan pradaan karne main kisi tarah kaa bhedbhaav kiye jane ko sire se khaarij karte hue grih mantralay ne kaha he ki bharat sarkaar ne kahin par bhi 'shahid' shabd ko paribhaashit nahin kiya he

 nafrat kii aag jab unke sansadeey kshetra bagpat tak failane lagi, tab jaakar ajit singh harakat main aae
 Muzaffarnagar had been burning since August 28 in the fire of communalism
 is sangharsh main jat or muslim samudaay aamane-saamne the, lekin pashchimi uttar pradesh main jat ke saath-saath muslim vot bhi kuch had tak hasil karne vaale rashtriya lokdal ke adhyaksh or kendriya nagar vimaanan mantri ajit singh ne chuppi saadh lee thi
 It was due to this that when the Panchayat of Jats fraternity took place at Chaudhary Charan Singh Inter College in Nangla Mandore near Kawal on August, the BJP-VHP leaders took the stage
 jat samudaay kaa netaa maane jane vaale bhartiya kisaan union ke rakesh tikait ke khilaaf bhi naaraazgi saaf dikhi thi or logon ne unke khilaaf narebaaji tak kii thi
 The silence of Ajit Singh, who had a hold on the Jat community, greatly angered the community
 lekin ab jab sampradayik dange kii aag unke sansadeey kshetra bagpat tak failane lagi, to ajit singh ko sauhaard sthapit karaane kii jimmedaari kaa ahsaas hone laga
 The administration also prevented him from visiting Baghpat as he prevented him from visiting Muzaffarnagar
 areldi supremeo ne elaan kiya ki ve gaanv-gaanv jaakar logon se baat karke shanti behaal karne kaa prayaas karenge or hinsa ke dar se palaayan kar chuke logon ko waapas laane kii koshish karenge
 In such a situation, the question arises that if Ajit Singh, who had a hold on the Jat community, would have started such a campaign in Kawal village of Muzaffarnagar immediately after the violence, would the communal fire have reached Baghpat? It might not have happened, but Ajit, caught in a duel between a Jat and a Muslim vote bank, then kept silence
 agar us vakt ve mujffanagar jate, to prashasan unhen is tarah nahin roktaa
 Now Ajit Singh is blaming the Samajwadi Party government and demanding imposition of President's rule in the state

 Actually, a woman in China decided that she would go to her house with a shortcut, but later realized that her path was not so easy
 china ke anhui praant main rahane vaali ek mahila ghar jane ke liye raat 10 baje kabristaan kii do deevaaron ke bich bane ek raste se nikalne kii koshish karne lagi
 But as he progressed, the path became narrower
 kaaphi der baad use ehsaas hua ki wo buree tarah funs gai he or waapas lautne kaa bhi koi phayda nahin tha kyonki vah bahut aage nikal ai thi
 She was trapped in two walls and had no choice but to solicit help from passers-by and people living nearby
 lekin logon ko laga diwaar ke bich main bhoot he or koi uski madad ke liye aage nahin aayaa
 The woman spent the whole night there and at five o'clock the next morning a passerby realized that the sound of shouting was not coming from the tomb and she sounded the alarm
 iske baad bachaav dal vahaan pahunchaa or unhone diwaar todakar mahila ko bachaa liya

 raav ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha ki bharat sarkaar or sibiai ne anderson ko america se pratyrpit karne kii puri koshish kii, lekin america se iske liye manjuuri nahin mili
 He stated that he (the United States) claimed that the Union Carbide factory was just a subsidiary and that this person (anderson) could not be directly held responsible, as he was not directly involved in operating the company
 haalanki ham unhen naitik taur par jimmedaar maan sakate hai
 Significantly, Lal, a former joint director of the CBI, was in charge of investigating the case
 unhone kal daawa kiya tha ki unpar videsh mantralay kii ore se anderson ke pratyrpan kaa prayaas nahin karne kaa dabaav tha
 Lal, who investigated the case between April 1994 and July 1995, said that the CBI investigation was affected and many officials directed it, resulting in justice being delayed in the Bhopal gas tragedy case, and thus justice was not found
 raav ne kaha ki is maamle main sibiai or videsh mantralay ke bich or videsh mantralay or america sarkaar ke bich anek baar patr vyavhaar hua
 Rao said that in the midst of the exchange of these letters, the Foreign Ministry probably wrote a letter, stating that the US was not approving Anderson's extradition
 lekin main yah kah saktaa hum ki kabhi bhi sibiai par is maamle ko rafa dfa karne ke liye videsh mantralay kii ore se dabaav nahin daalaa gaya
 Regarding Lal's claims, Rao said that asking him (to Lal) is not a question but asking the CBI is the real issue
 purv sibiai pramukh ne kaha ki unhone keval itnaa kaha he ki ek patr aayaa tha lekin vah patr mere jariye hi aayaa hota
 But i do not know what was in that letter
 media main bhi abhi tak hamane us patr ko nahin dekha he
 Rao said that letters were exchanged several times between the CBI and the Foreign Ministry
 unhone kaha ki yah patr shaayad america sarkaar kii ore se pratyrpan kii manjuuri na milane ke sandarbh main ho
 But one thing is clear that he (america) was not willing to extradite him to India
 raav ne jor dete hue kaha ki bharat sarkaar, sibiai or videsh mantralay kisi ne bhi or kabhi anderson ke pratyrpan ke maamle ko chhod nahin diya tha
 He said that we always tried for it
 lekin hamaari prayek koshish diwaar par sir maarane jaisi rahi

 On this occasion, Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis has announced the release of the film 'uri: The Surgical Strike' at 500 places in the state for free
 kargil vijay diwas par devendra fadanvis ke is faisle ko raajnneetik vishleshak ek siyaasi daanv maan rahe hai
 Assembly elections are due in Maharashtra this year
 bhartiya janata party (bijepi) kii koshish loksabhaa chunaav kii tarah vidhansabha chunaav main sargical strike ko bhunaane kii hogi
 Actually, everything is not going well in the relationship between BJP and Shiv Sena in Maharashtra
 shivasena ne mukhyamantri ke pad ke liye daawa thonka he
 Meanwhile, the BJP has started laying political ground
 loksabhaa chunaav kii tarah bijepi maharashtra ke vidhansabha chunaav main logon ke bich apane kaamon ke saath pakistan ko sabak sikhaane ke liye kiye gaye sargical strike or airstrike ko bhi lekar jaaegi
 It starts with the film Uri on Kargil Vijay Divas
 kargil vijay diwas par sargical strike1999 main atal bihari vaajapeyi kii sarkaar ke dauraan pakistan ne yuddh ched diya tha
 On 26 July 1999, India won the Kargil War

 The film 'border' was also made in Bollywood on the Kargil war
 kargil vijay diwas kii 20veen varshganth par maharashtra sarkaar ne 'uri: da sargical strike' film ko dikhaane kaa faisla kiya he
 In this film, the Indian Army avenged the Uri attack in 2016 from terrorists fleeing in Pakistan

 The slogan of 2019 elections 'how is the Josh' and BJP managed to win more seats in 2019 than in 2014
 sargical strike ko modi sarkaar apane kaarykaal kii badi uplabdhi maanati he
 This is the reason that Maharashtra is once again putting its courageous decision in public before the elections
 mukhyamantri kii kursi ko lekar khinchatanuri film dikhaane kaa mukhya makasad mukhyamantri kii kursi ko lekar bijepi or shivasena ke bich parde ke peeche khinchataan bhi he
 a few days ago, Shiv Sena wrote in its mouthpiece 'saamana', claiming that the next CM of Maharashtra would be his own
 shivasena ne kaha tha, 'bijepi ke kaaryakartaaon ke saamne unke netaa kehete hai, 'chintaa mat karo, mukhyamantri hamaara hi hoga
 "here we also say," The next Chief Minister will be of Shiv Sena
 'fadanvis ne kaha tha, main hi vaapasi karungashivsena ke is bayaan ke baad mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis ne kaha tha, 'main sirf bijepi kaa hi nahin balki shivasena, arpiai, rashtriya samaaj paksh kaa bhi mukhyamantri hum
 The public will decide who will be the next chief minister
 aapako chintaa karne kii aavashyaktaa nahin he
 Only our work will speak for us

 unke jaal main mat fanciye
 There are many people in both parties who keep talking unnecessarily

 Aditya Thackeray called for creating a 'new Maharashtra'
 is maukey par aditya thakare ne kaha tha ki yah yatra aagaamee chunaav ke maddenzar vot maangane kaa abhiyaan nahin he balki unke liye 'tirth yatra' he
 While Sanjay Raut had praised Aditya Thackeray, he said that if Shiv Sena got the post of Chief Minister, then Thackeray would hold the post
 agle maheene fadanvis bhi nikaalenge yatraaditya thakare ke baad vidhansabha chunaav ke maddenjar mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis agle maheene rajya kii yatra shuru karne ja rahe hai, jo lagbhag har vidhansabha kshetra se gujaregi
 The purpose of this Yatra is not only to heat up the workers, but there will also be a formal announcement to contest elections under their leadership
 mana ja rahaa he ki party rajya vidhansabha kaa chunaav apane 'brand' par ladanaa chaahegi
 His 'brand' also has a surgical strike, which is being tried to be redeemed through 'uri: The Surgical Strike'

 america raashtrapati donald trump ne piem modi ke bolne ke andaaj kii nakal kii he
 Trump copied this when he was referring to the US policy on Afghanistan
 trump ne bataaya ki modi ne unase ek baar kaha tha- 'behad kam ritern par america ne afghanistan kii madad kii he, aisa koi desh nahin karata
 While saying this, Trump also mimicked Modi's style of speaking English
 trump ne kii bhartiya netaa ke uccharan kii naklwashington post kii report ke mutabik, is maheene ke shuruuaati dinon main jab trump ne haiti or africa rashtron par tippanee kii thi, us dauraan unhone bhartiya netaa ke uccharan kii nakal bhi kii thi
 London Mayor Sadiq Khan said, "let us talk about the language of terrorists, Donald Trump, Trump and Modi's friendship has been discussed on many occasions
" isi kaa asar he ki haal hi main trump prashasan dwaara bharat ke dushman desh pakistan kii aalochana bhi kii gai thi
 Several claims made by the US President claimed that the Indian leader's (modi) remarks are proof of how the world views America
 afghanistan main america ne bahut kaam kiya he or isko duniya bhi samaj rahi he
 The article in Forbes, if Trump wants to succeed, consider Modi to be his role model first
 If it is true that Trump has copied the Indian Prime Minister, it will not be the first time
 isse pehle bhi 2016 ke vasant main, chunaav abhiyaan ke dauraan, trump ne aisi hi aawaaj nikaal kar bharat main kol centre ke pratinidhi kaa majaak udaaya tha
 The famous writers took part in the 'kalam Azad Hai Teri' session of 'sahitya Aaj Tak'
 is dauraan unhone kalam kii aazaadee se lekar mahilaon tak ke mudde par apni baat rakhi
 Indira Dongi, Neelima Chauhan and Sharmila Bohra Jalan were among the female authors who touched the new highs of popularity from writing and broke many shackles
 indira daangi ne kaha- jo mahasoos karte hai, wo likhte hyaapane pehle hi upanyaas 'rapatile rajpath' se sahitya jagat main chaa jane vaali indira daangi hindi yuva lekhan kaa janaa pahachaanaa naam hai
 In his compositions, he stirred the mind of the woman in such a way that she rose above the body debate and became such a question in itself, whose answers are still being sought
 kaarykram ke dauraan jab indira daangi se poocha gaya ki kalam kii aazaadee kaa matlab kahin bold or belgaum lekhan to nahin? is par unhone kaha ki sahanubhuti or swanbhuti main jo fark hota he, vahi yahaan par bhi he
 The way of earlier writing and today's writing is different
 aaj ham jo mahasoos karte hai, wo likhte hai or isko koi roak nahin saktaa he, kyonki kalam hamaare haath main he
 In the heroine of Premachandra, the talk of the oppressed women was written and today the pain of the women is written
 ham sirf stri vimarsh nahin likhte hai
 We write about humanitarianism
 un mahilaon kii kahani likhte hai, jinako jalaayaa jaataa he, kaata jaataa he, maaraa jaataa he, bhed-bakrii kii tarah kisi ke saath bhi bhej diya jaataa he, rape kiya jaataa he or pratadit kiya jaataa he
 i am a writer, neither a woman nor a man
 Neelima Chauhananilima collected stories of rebel love-marriages and compiled it with Ashok Kumar Pandey
 par unhen shoharat 'patansheel patniyon ke nots' se mili
 Neelima Chauhan, while writing her, also echoes men with her words, but like hardcore Feminists, men are not anti-people
 vah 'jeeyo ore jeene do' kii khubsuurati main yakeen karti hai or jivan or lekhan donon main santulan kii himachati hai
 In response to a question, he said, 'we write stories of struggle
 main ek lekhak hum, na main stri hum or na hi purush hum
 Being independent is the root of the pen
 isko bandhak main nahin hona chahie
 By the way, being an author is the ideal situation
 ek hindustan main kai hindustan main haih sharmila bohara jalaan'shaadi se peshtar', 'boodha chaand', 'raag-viraag or anya kahaniyaan' sharmila bohara jalaan kii charchit kitaaben hai
 She is such a new-age writer who speaks in the form of a story
 masalan baat bhale hi nai ho, par kehane or bataane kaa dhang unka apana he
 When asked if a writer writes a woman only to sell books and achieve fame, she said, 'it is not so
 stri man kii sthiti he
 a man can also write the feeling of a woman better
 main ek lekhak hum or ek lekhak, lekhak hota he
 a writer should not try to tie within the boundaries of woman or man
 kalam kisi ke virodh or pratirodh main hi uthaai jaati he
 During writing, the writer has to go through all the duality
 unhone kaha ki agar ek lekhika bold hokar likhti he, to samaaj baichaiyn kyon ho jaataa he? aisi lekhikaon ke charitra par hi ungali uthne lagati he
 It is said that there are no women who come from rural areas
 wo mahilaayein nahin hai, jo vastav main peedit hai
 It talks about women who drink alcohol
 aakhir samaaj aisi mahilaon ke lekhan ko sweekaar kyon nahin kar paata he? kuch bhi ho, lekin samaaj ko ise sweekaar karnaa hoga

 Defense Minister Nirmala Sitharaman answered the Congress one by one question on the Rafale deal in Parliament
 congress par hamalaa bolte hue sitaraman ne kaha ki rafel saude par gatirodh utpann kiya gaya
 The Congress did not understand the need of the army and compromised the security of the country
 unhone kaha ki hamen apane padosi mulkon se khatra he or hamen kshetra main shanti rakhni hogi
 He said that for this we also need to strengthen our army so that our borders can be secured
 saath hi unhone naseehat dete hue kaha ki hamen apane padosi deshon se siikhnaa chahie
 China and Pakistan are increasing their capacity and buying weapons
 unhone congress par sawaal khadaa karte hue kaha ki 2014 tak congress rafel sauda kyon nahin kar pai
 During the defense minister's response, the opposition continued to create a ruckus
 tabhi unhone kanges ko gherte hue poocha ki kyon nahin hasil kar pai rafel vimaan, lekin aaj rafel deal ho jane ke baad congress hangaamaa kar rahi he
 Simultaneously, Sitharaman said, 'congress should answer my questions
 bataae ki kiske chalate or kiske liye nahin hui rafel deal? yah bhi bataae ki desh kii suraksha ke saath khilwaad kyon kiya?'aa ke jawaab main sitaraman kaa RV or qsiwaramana ke bhaashan ke dauraan congress ne sawaal poocha ki sauda AA (anil ambani) ke liye kiya gaya? is par unhone congress ko jawaab diya ki agar aap AA kii baat karte hai to har AA ke jawaab main ek RV (robert wadra) or q (kwatrochi) kaa naam aa jaataa he
 He also said that RV is the son-in-law of the country, not PM
 hamane 14 maheene main puri kii dealraksha mantri ne kaha ki congress ko sach sunne kii himmat honi chahie
 The defense deal process did not last for 10 years, we completed the deal in 14 months
 upie ke vakt main 10 saal tak qaraar kii prakriya tak puri nahin ho pai jabaki hamane 3 maheene main yah karke dikhaaya he
 He said that those who could not complete the deal in their two terms are seeking answers from us
 raksha mantri ne kaha ki tay samay se 15 maheene pehle hi rafel vimaan bharat aa jayega
 Not only this, he said that all 36 aircraft will arrive in India 5 months ahead of schedule
 sitambar 2019 main pehle rafel kii delivery hogi
 Also by 2022 all the aircraft will be coming to India
 nirmala sitaraman ne kaha ki raksha saude or raksha main saudebaaji main antar hota he
 The UPA did not intend to buy Rafale
 wo nahin chaahati thi ki rafel bharat aae
 136 Not only 18 aircraft were to be bought
 The Minister of Congress said that Dassau did not take guarantee of HAL made aircraft
 sitaraman ne standing cameti kii report kaa hawala dete hue kaha ki congress HAL ke liye ghadiyaali aansu baha rahi he
 The Standing Committee questioned the competence of HAL
 HAL ne samay par vimaan nahin banaae the, iske baad bhi HAL main sudhaar ke liye bhi kadam nahin uthaae gaye
 He also said that Congress was going to buy not just 136 but 18 aircraft
 hamane vimaanon kii sankhya 18 se badhaakar 36 kii
 Congress is misleading the country on Rafale deal
 saath hi unhone kaha ki HAL ko agasta vaala sauda kyon nahin diya gaya
 Also in 1982, 36 mig-23s were purchased in a hurry
 bataa den ki congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi samet puri congress party rafel maamle ko lekar bhaajapa par unke sawaalon ke jawaab na dene kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 The Congress had said that PM is silent on this issue, Defense Minister is silent and no one is responding
 sarkaar main aane par jimmedaar logon ko hogi sajaa: rahulaisase pehle congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne rafel maamle ko lekar pradhanmantri narendra modi par ek baar phir nishaanaa saadhaa or kaha ki 2019 main unki party kii sarkaar banane par is maamle kii aapraadhik jaanch hogi or jimmedaar logon ko dandit kiya jayega
 Gandhi also said that instead of attacking him, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley should answer the questions the country is asking on the Rafael case
 unhone sansad bhawan parisar main kaha, ‘yuvaaon, kisaanon dekh lo
 The Prime Minister got 30 thousand crores to Anil Ambani
 charchaa ke samay pradhanmantri sansad main nahin the
 He fled the discussion on Rafael
 ’ congress adhyaksh ne kaha, ‘arun jetali ne lanbaa bhaashan diya, mujhe gaali di
 But the questions which have not been answered
 ’unhone sawaal kiya, ‘vimaan kii keemat ko 526 karod rupee se badhaakar 1600 karod rupee kiya gaya
 Who enhanced it? Did the Air Force increase or did the Prime Minister increase? ' Gandhi said, "did the Air Force ask for 126 aircraft or 36 aircraft? Who got the contract for Anil Ambani? Former French President François Hollande said that at the instance of Modi ji, he gave the contract to Anil Ambani? Did the Defense Ministry officials object to the new deal? ”he said,“ Hopefully the Defense Minister will respond to it
 lekin main aapako bataa saktaa hum ki wo un sawaalon kaa jawaab nahin dengi
 This is my doubt
 ’ gandhi ne kaha, ‘ucchtam nyaayalay ne apane aadesh main kahin nahin kaha he ki jaanch nahin honi chahie
 If our government is formed in 2019, then there will be a criminal investigation on it and those responsible will be punished
 ’ unhone ek baar phir se yah maang doharaai ki is maamle kii sanyukt sansadeey samiti (jepisi) se jaanch honi chahie
 Earlier, Gandhi tweeted and said, "by granting Rafael's contract to his friend Anil Ambani, the Prime Minister worked to undermine national security apart from corruption
 aise main pradhanmantri ke khilaaf jaanch honi chahie
 The Ambani group has already denied the allegations leveled by the Congress
 rajdhani dilli or aas-paas ke ilaakon main naaballigon ke khilaaf aparaadh rukne kaa naam hi nahin le rahe
 Now a case has been reported of neighbors from Faridabad having a heartbreaking gang-rape of a lonely minor girl at home
 shikaayat milane ke baad police ne naaballig bacchee se rape ke aarope main teenon aropiyon ko giraftaar kar liya he
 According to police, the victim told that during the gang rape, the accused used to make pornographic videos of her
 police ne aropiyon ke paas se ashleel video bhi baraamad kar liye hai
 Police said that a case has been registered against the accused under the POSCO Act and the case is being investigated
 peedita kii maa ne bataaya ki unhen apni 12 saal kii beti ke saath ho rahe anachar kaa pataa tab chalaa, jab bacchee ek din unase kaam par na jane kii guhaar karne lagi
 When the mother asked for the reason, the girl narrated a full cry
 jaankaree ke mutabik, peedita ke mata-pita ek privet company main kaam karte hai or roj bacchee ko ghar par akelaa chhod kaam ke liye nikal jate hai
 Here, as soon as the parents went to work, three young men living in the neighborhood would enter the house and take the minor girl in turn as a victim of their lust
 peedita ne bataaya ki kai baar aropiyon ne use kisi na kisi bahaane se apane ghar par bulaakar bhi uskaa rape kiya
 During this time, the accused would have also made the rape video of the victim
 aaropee ashleel video ke sahare naaballig ko daraate or jaan se maarane kii dhamkee bhi dete the
 As soon as the news of incest with their girl child started, the family reached the police station with the girl and lodged a complaint
 bacchee kii maa kaa kahana he ki unhen apni beti ke liye nyaay chahie
 At the same time, when Indu Bala, in-charge of Mahila police station, was asked in this case, he told that this matter has come to his notice and he has registered a case against three youths and arrested them
 aarushi talwaar kii hatya ke maamle main sibiai ne ek hi saboot par aadhaarit do paraspar virdohi reportein daakhil kii hai
 The first CBI inquiry led by Joint Director Arun Kumar took place between June 2008 and April 2009
 arun kumaar ne apni jaanch may 2009 main upanideshak nilabh kishor ke netritv vaali team ko saunp di
 While Arun Kumar's team acquitted Aarushi's father Rajesh Talwar and cast doubt on the three servants, the other team, while acquitting the servants, pointed the finger at Talwar
 sibiai tiimon ke paraspar virdohi donon nishkarsh sahi nahin ho sakate
 The only suspect Talwar says is to reopen the case
 to 16 may, 2008 ko aarushi kii hatya kisne kii? arun kumaar kii team ke mutabik, hatya vaali raat ko teen gharelu naukar-krishna, rajkumaar or vijay mandal hemraj ke kamare main sharaab pite hue aarushi ke bare main baat kar rahe the, sharaab ke nashe main ve aarushi ke kamare main gaye, uskaa munh band kar diya or kisi bhothari cheez se uske sir par waar kiya
 According to Arun Kumar, "he also tried to force a relationship with Aarushi
" '' isse unamem jhagada hone laga
 Fearing that his parents would not wake up after hearing the noise, they went to the terrace, where the prince and Krishna quarreled with Hemraj and killed Hemraj
 phir krishna or rajkumaar aarushi ke kamare main waapas aae or uski gardan ret di
 Arun's team conducted a narco test of the servants but left the Talwar couple after testing them with a lie-catching machine
 kishor kii jaanch hatya vaale din hatya vaali raat kii ghatnaon kaa isse ekadam vipareet byora detii he
 According to him, the three servants were not at the Talwar couple's house when Aarushi was killed
 ghar main talwaar dampati hi the
 The investigation claims that after killing Aarushi, her personal parts were cleaned, blood stains and scratches on the stairs leading to the roof were also cleaned
 unka maananaa he ki hemraj ko bedshit main lapetakar chat tak le jaaya gaya
 The presence of a bottle of Scotch whiskey on the dining table, which had traces of blood from both individuals who died, indicated that the murderer may have committed alcohol after the crime
 aarushi kaa mobile gaayab tha, jo hatya ke 14 maheene baad sitambar 2009 main mila, uski memory puri tarah mitaa di gai thi
 Unlike Arun Kumar's team, Kishore conducted a narco test of the Talwar couple
 closer report main kaha gaya he ''naukaron ke khilaaf koi saboot nahin he, sivaa narko test ke, jis par vishwaas nahin kiya ja saktaa
 "in the same report, the agency says that scientific tests done on the Talwar couple" do not clearly show that they have a hand in the crime
 '' sibiai kaa nateeja haih naukar nirdosh, talwaar sandigdh
 Kishore's team decided to present a new proof - a golf stick, which he described as the same thing that led to Aarushi's death
 aarushi kaa galaa uske baad kisi tej dhardaar cheez se 'peshewar' haathon se reta gaya
 The closure report, however, states that the "murder weapon golf stick cannot be linked to crime
" ''kishor kii team kii ore se naukaron ko bari kar diya gaya, kyonki ve pratyaksh rup se ghar main nahin the
 Where were they back then? According to the report of Kishore, Rajkumar Night 11, the domestic help of Durrani (family friend of Talwar couple)
 30 se railway stesan par tha kyonki vah durrani kii patni ko lene gaya tha
 Durrani denies that he had told such a thing to CBI
 krishna ko uttar pradesh police ne uske ghar se hiraasat main liya
 Then he was sleeping
 report main bataaya gaya ki is baat ke ''pratyaksh gavaah'' hai, (jo krishna ke parivaar ke sadsy the) kii hatya vaali raat vah ghar par akelaa tha
 Kishore's team also questioned the post-mortem doctors
 nae tathyon ke mutabik sir par chot kii jagah pehle kii postmortem kii report main bataai jagah se alag thi
 It was also said that the membrane of Aarushi's genitals was torn, and it was already so
 '' yah baat mul postmortem report main nahin thi
 The closure report has other flaws, such as those of a retired police officer
 ke
 The role of Gautam, who discovered Hemraj's corpse the day after Aarushi's murder
 report ke mutabik, gautam ek saajha mitra ke jariye talwaar parivaar se parichit the or unki seva kaa istemaal aarushi kii postmortem report se 'balaatkaar' shabd hataane ke liye kiya gaya
 The CBI states that the Talwar couple first refused to identify Hemraj's body, raising suspicion
 report kahati he ki golf kii chadi saal bhar tak chhipaakar rakhi gai or use acchhee tarah saaf kar diya gaya
 The Talwar couple demanded a CBI inquiry
 sibiai ne us raat kii ghatnaon kii dhundhlee tasviir pesh kii he
 The overall conclusion of the closure report is: "the crime does not have a clear motive for murder and the sequence of events is not complete
" iske alaava aparaadh ke ek hathiyaar ko hasil nahin kiya ja sakaa he or naukaron yaa mata-pita se unke sambandhon kii bhi spasht jaankaree nahin he
 "then why is Rajesh Talwar still a suspect? CBI has to shut down the investigation into the unresolved tunnel case

 is baar phir unase chunaav ladane kii ichha poochi gai
 In response, he said that he can give a seat to the BJP on his own in Bengal

 She has been an air hostess
 khaas baat ye he ki jis tarah babul supriyo ek flite main baba ramdev se mili, usee tarah unki bhavi patni rachana sharma se bhi unki mulaakaat ek flite main hi hui
 When the two met for a few minutes in Jet Airways's mumbai-kolkata flight in 2016, they did not know that the above had written a different story for them
 ye milan jald hi shaadi ke rishte main badal gaya
 The two got married in August 2016
 shaadi ke baad babul supriyo ne kaha tha ki aajkal unki zindagi ke faisle jameen se 30-35 hajaar feet upar ho rahe hai
 Now Rachna and they also have a daughter
 bataa den ki babul supriyo kii ye duusari shaadi he, pehali patni se unka talaak ho chukaa he, pehali shaadi se unhen sharmili naam kii ek beti he

 So far, the development of Gujarat's model of Gujarat in the country, ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's development in Gujarat, has led to a question in front of the Anandiben government of the state these days
 pehle patidaar aarakshan andolan or ab dalitkand ne anandiben ko gujarat kii mukhyamantri pad se hataae jane kii baat ko ek baar phir se tool de di he
 Trouble is that the state and the central government have failed to take strict action in the actual Dalit incident, in view of this, all political parties are engaged in smearing their own pulses
 isaki shuruyaat bispi kii mayawati ne rajyasabha main mudde ko oochaal kar, anandiben kii lau and order par hi sawaal khadey kar die
 At the same time, it has become very difficult not only for the state government, but also for the central government
 sattadhari party ke log bhi anandiben ke khilaafgujrat main daliton kii sthiti ko lekar ek baar phir soobe kii siem anandiben par sawaal khadey ho gaye
 Not only the opposition against Anandiben, now even some disgruntled leaders of the ruling party are airing this issue
 koshish yah ki ise ek raajnneetik sankat ke taur par pesh kiya jaae
 Wherever there is a race to become a big Dalit leader, the reason is also clear
 patidaar andolan se nipatane main bhi naakaamayabanandiben patelke liye dalitkand se pehle patidaar andolan ek bada sankat ban kar aayaa tha, jisase abhi aannadiben ubhari nahin paayi thim
 After the Patidar agitation, Om Mathur submitted a report to the BJP high command, stating that the Anandiben government had completely failed to stop the Patidar agitation
 itnaa hi nahin anandiben ke shashan main bijepi kaaryakartaaon ke bich andruni ladaai bhi badi he
 After this report, there was continuous talk that Anandiben could be removed as the Chief Minister of Gujarat
 khud kii cabinet ke kai mantri khafaanandiben ke shashan ke liye ye bhi baat aa rahi he ki anandiben kii sarkaar main sabase zyada unke bete-beti kii chalati he, aise main anandiben kii khud kii cabinet ke kai mantri anandiben se naaraaz chal rahe hai
 This is the reason that if there is any movement in Gujarat, the ministers become passive in stopping the movement
 aise main naa koi damege control hota he or naa hi sabhi tarah kii sachai sarkaar ke saamne rakhi jaati he
 There will be repeated speculation that Anandibenanandiben will be removed from his CM post this November
 darasal bijepi main ye kaha jaataa he ki jo bhi netaa 75 saal ke hote hai unhen bijepi ke maardarshak mandal main bheja jaataa he
 Although Anandiben is also turning 75 this November
 aise main kaha ja rahaa he ki anandiben ko hataakar kisi rajya kaa rajyapal banaaya ja saktaa he yaa phir unhen maardarshak mandal main bhej diya jayega
 Once again, there has been talk of removing the Anandiben government which failed to stop the violence spread in Gujarat after the Dalit scandal

 The day after yesterday, at Balrampur police station, about a hundred kilometers away, the old files got stuck while turning over

 naksaliyon main katl-e-aam
 That loot amount too! The Balrampur police had assured that such fights are common among the Naxalites of Surguja
 yahaan gaanvvaale bhi batalaate hai us commander kii lootmaari kaa yahaan lagbhag aatank tha
 Twenty-five years old, he had brought some twenty-twenty-five-year-old youth from Jharkhand, giving them training as 'naxalites'
 yah yuvak uske tole main the, sab ek saath jangalon main rahete the
 a few months ago a huge amount was handed over
 chah lakh
 It did not give him a 'share', as a result of the murder
 kune or makke ke khet ke saamne apane ghar main baees saal kii yah ladki is subah apane pati ko yaad karti he
 
 apane pati ke parivaar par ashrith
 Poor peasant family but a gold-plated watch in this girl's hand
 sil par masaale pisati he, chuulhe par sabji talati he, bhutte senkati he
 In the courtyard, the clock keeps ringing between colored bangles amid the tinkling drops
 is puure pradesh main koi gramin mahila ab tak nahin dekhi jo ghadi pahane ho, yah bhi yaad nahin aata kab kisi aurat ko sil par batta ghiste vakt ghadi pahane dekha tha
 He had gifted? What? Was gifted to you? His eyes are still shocked
 unhone hi di hogi shaayad, tabhi to aap itani subah bhi kaam karte vakt ise pahane hai
 so
 
 
 unki patni hai ham
 Had got us married, if we will not wear their lamp, then whose

 First its elder sister
 is gaanv se sate thane ke thanedaar ne batalaaya tha or isane bhi kaha ki usase sirf ladkiyaan paidaa hui thim isliye vah ise byaah laayaa
 But it also revealed that the commander liked it long ago
 police ke register main mritak kii patni bataur choti bahan kaa naam hi darj
 Closing the register, the SHO had also slowly said, 'if he brought his first wife out of the house to bring her fourteen years younger than him, what a surprise, you will know
 'vah der tak apane pati ko batalaati he
 'baniye got beaten up by the police implicated in a false case, then he became a Naxalite
 jangal main rahete the, teen-chaar maheene main ek baar ghar aate the
 Went to jail once or twice
 baahar aa thodaa samay thik rahe phir naksali ban gaye
 Became naxalites? How is a Naxalite formed? They were right
 wo logon se paisa kyon lutate the?to
 
 
 How do you work? How to protect the forest? Jungle? Yes, he was the protector of the forest, he increases Sika Bhuta
 angan main girti buundon ke duusari ore sasur kii si umr vaale uske jeth chaar kinare vaale kisi rainuma yantra se rassi bun rahe hai
