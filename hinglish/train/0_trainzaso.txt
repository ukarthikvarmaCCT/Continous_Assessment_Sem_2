 54 varshiya thakur kii sevanivruti ab chand saal shesh rah gaye hai, lekin ab tak unke pad kaa srijan nahin kiya ja sakaa he
 The personnel of most departments of the state get the sixth pay scale, but Thakur has to be satisfied with the fourth pay scale

 He had a brain hemorrhage six months ago

 Hence, Rs 20 lakhs of development item

 The difficulty now is that the chairman has been made, but the number of members is not necessary to make the decision

 Even if he was made the chairman of three academies last year, the absence of a full-time director does not work

 Forgetting the frustration of the embarrassing defeat in the Test series against Australia, captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni has talked about moving ahead by forgetting
 test cricket main prabhaavaheen captaini or lachar pradarshan ke liye aalochanaon kaa saamana kar rahe mahendra singh dhoni ne peshkash kii he ki agar bisisiai ko lagata he ki behatar vikalp maujuud he to vah khel ke lambey praaroop kii captaini chhodane ko taiyaar hai
 Dhoni said that if someone can do a better job than him in the Test, then he will be happy to give up the captaincy in the interest of the team
 austrailia ke khilaaf buudhvaar ko hone vaale twanti-20 match se purv dhoni ne kaha, ‘captaini kisi ek ke liye nahin he
 i hold a position and this is an additional responsibility
 main jab tak yah jimmedaari nibhaa rahaa hum tab tak is kaam main acha karnaa chahta hum lekin aisa nahin hai ki main isse chipka rahanaa chahta hum
 If a better alternative exists, it can come
 ’unhone kaha, ‘aakhir ant main aap chaahate hai ki bharat acha pradarshan kare
 If someone can do this job better then the captaincy should be handed over to him
 ’ test team main wicketiper ballebaaj or captain ke rup main dhoni kii bhoomika par sawaal uthne lage hai
 Under his captaincy, the team had to face defeat in foreign matches in seven consecutive matches, while he also failed to bat
 england main unhone chaar test main 31
 220 runs at an average of 43 while Dhoni 20 in six innings of three Tests in Australia
 40 kii ausat se keval 102 ran juta paae
 Dhoni said, 'I was given this responsibility three and a half years ago
 main is bhoomika ko nibhaane, team ke saath aage badhane or acha pradarshan karne kaa prayaas kar rahaa hum
 The Indian captain had earlier hinted during the Test series that he could leave Test cricket altogether until 2013 to be available until the 2015 World Cup
 dhoni ne kaha, ‘2013 tak do saal hai
 i do not know if i will live until then
 ipel, champions lig or lagaataar shrinkhalaaon main khelnaa pad rahaa he
 You cannot decide in advance about the program and the rest
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘mujhe 2013 tak faisla karnaa hoga lekin isamen ab bhi do saal hai
 i cannot say in 2014 that i am not playing the next World Cup and just give around 25 matches to prove myself to the other player
 ’dhoni ne haalanki spasht kiya ki test cricketer ke rup main unka karier samaapt nahin hua he lekin unka maananaa he ki yah faisla puri tarah se unke haath main nahin he
 He said, 'I am still moving forward on my journey
 main kisi anjaam tak nahin pahunchaa hum
 But no player makes this decision, others decide whether you are worth it or not
 ’bhartiya captain ne kaha, ‘ek khilaadi ke rup main main apana shat pratishat de rahaa hum
 i am still doing what i used to do before
 test cricket hi asal cricket he
 But i am not reducing other formats
 sabhi praroopon kii apni chunautiyaan hai
 Dhoni said that the atmosphere of the dressing room is chirping with the noise of the youth while it was quite calm and serious during the presence of senior players
 unhone kaha, ‘hamaari vanade team bilkul alag najar aati he
 It makes a lot of noise and maintains the spirit in the dressing room
 log ek duusare kii taang khinchate hai or jeevantta bani rahati he
 He said, 'it is like you have come from Kishore Kumar to Sheen Pal's world
 yah is tarah kaa antar he
 Dhoni stressed the importance of senior players in the team without naming him and said that criticism is unnecessary after a poor performance in the Test
 unhone kaha, ‘‘umr sirf ek sankhya he
 If players continue to score runs, no one will talk about it
 jab aap ran nahin banaaoge to sab kuch baahar aa jayega, aap kitni tej daudte ho, running ke dauraan kitni teji se palatate ho lekin ham ise lekar chintit nahin hai
 Dhoni hoped for the team's better performance in the limited-overs matches to be held in the next few weeks

 lagata he, isane chunaav surveykshan ke dhandhe main lage anokhe naam vaale sitare todes chanakya ko bhi jakad liya
 It has acquired a considerable reputation for accurately predicting elections, right up to the last point of the decimal point
 iskaa sabase sunaharaa kshan vah tha, jab pichhali garmiyon ke aam chunaav main isane endie ke liye 340 siton kii bhavishyavaanee kar di thi
 Now twice in a row its predictions have turned out to be wrong
 maharashtra or jharkhand, donon rajyon main iskaa purvanumaan tha ki sarvashaktimaanbijepi badi fatahhasil karegi, lekin pataa chalaa ki donon hi jagah use vijay to mili lekin pehali jeet katai adhuri thi to taaja chunaav main vah jeet ko chhu bhar saki
 In the poll survey, Chanakya is like the Big Bull of the stock market and its estimates have been like an external observer
 ab tak isaki kamyaabi kii vajah sidhi-saadi thi
 There was a Modi / BJP wave, so it was safe to predict from outside
 tamaam laharon kii tarah ab jab yah lahar bhi utaar par he—abhi palati nahin he—to sidhaa-sida purana bijganit kaam nahin aata
 Overall, Modi's BJP cannot be denied the credit for another electoral victory
 unka rajnatik ashwamedh yajna kaliyug main bhi utana hi chunautiviheen dikhaai detaa he, jitna apekshtya sadaachari treta yug main bhagwaan ram kaa tha
 He has taken another kingdom in his hands
 zyada ahm baat yah he ki yah gambhir rup se sankatagrast or asaadhaaran rup se sambhaavnavan rajya jharkhand he, jisane apane 14 saal ke vajood main kabhi bahumat kaa janadesh nahin diya tha
 But bjp's total seats show that it has lost about 20 of the 56 assembly segments it had won in the Lok Sabha elections
 party kashmir bhi fatah nahin kar saki or apane ‘mishan44’ ke badbhole daawey par khara utarane main naakaam rahi
 But there she managed to oust the Congress as the largest national party and also confirmed that the party's decline is all-national as well as secular
 ham ab bhi bhala kyon shikaayat kar rahe hai?hawaaen ab bhibijepi ke paksh main bah rahihain, lekin maharashtra or jharkhand uski raftaar ke dhimi (haalanki palatney se bahut dur) hone ke pehle sanket hai
 In Maharashtra, the party fell far short of a majority, failing to woo the Shiv Sena
 jharkhand main use maamuli bahumat mila
 Both results were far less than his family Kautilya or election surveyor Chanakya promised
 kashmir main bhi uske 3 fisadi vot or ek ko chhodkar baaki sabhi ummidavaaron kii jamaanat jabt hone se sachaai kii acchhee parakh hoti he
 If you combine these results with the defeats in the by-elections in Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan, you will be able to see the whole picture
 vah daur jab chunaav main fatah ke liye modi kaa naam hi kaaphi tha, khaskar haryana ke udhaaharan se saaf tha, ab jane vaala he
 One more nuance cannot be hidden from the eyes of a man like Modi: All easy victories are limited to states where there is a direct contest with the Congress
 jeemem se lekar pidipi / ensi tak or argedy / jedy(you) / sapa tak tamaam duusare khilaadi apane-apane ilaakon kii kahin behatar raksha kar paa rahe hai
 The 'lamp post' phase of electoral politics after May 2014 is coming to an end
 modi or bijepi ko puraane dharre kii rajnatik chakki kii taraf lautnaa hoga
 State leaders have to stand up
 puraane sahyogiyon ko thukaraane kii ranneeti par dobaaraa vichaar karnaa hoga
 Most important, politics and government have to be brought back on the same old tracks — on the tracks of good governance, economic growth, development — on which they came to power
 india today ke surkhiyon ke sartaaj 2014 narendra modi kai anuthi khaasiyaton se bharpoor hai
 He is our most effective political speaker in decades, even better than Vajpayee
 ve hamaare pehle puri tarah swa-nirmit sachche rashtriya netaa hai
 But of even greater importance is that they understand the power of media (traditional, social and anti-social), the usefulness of the talk and the importance of public perception better than any other public figure in our history
 vah satta ke shikhar par bhi hai
 So my question to Modi is this: Then why are they letting others, colleagues as well as opponents, grab their headlines? This is the nukes, which are never found in the true player of politics
 mujhe puraa ehsaas he ki main yah thik us vakt likh rahaa hum jab aresas ke sarasanghachaalak mohan bhagwat teen din kii yatra par dilli aae hai or yah yatra har lihaaj se kisi bhi rajya pramukh kii yatra se zyada mahatvapurn ho sakati he
 It is possible that some of the questions i am posing are settled before his return to Nagpur (or wherever he prefers to return to spend a Christian New Year's Eve)
 lekin hakeekat yahi he ki aresas or usase jude sanghathan aaj baqayada khud apane pradhanmantri kii surkhiyaan chura rahe hai
 They have also given opponents a chance to peek inside these cracks
 ranneeti ke taur par sansad ke kaam main rukaawatein daalane kaa vichaar chaahe jitna bhi vibhats kyon na ho, aresas, viechpi or baaki sanghathanon ne vipakshi dalon ko ek nayaa, secular ucch naitik dharaatal tohfe main de diya he
 No one knows whether our Vedic scientists and vaidyas had the ability to burn their bodies again
 lekin unke uttaradhikariyon ke naate sangh parivaar ke kartadharta utane hi bejaan pade vipakshi dalon main secular ekta ke usee puraane, asardaar, par haasyaaspad amrit ke balboote par dobaaraa praan foonkane ke chamatkaar ko anjaam de rahe hai
 For example, statesmen in the valley and statesmen say that Modi was well appreciated for his frequent visits and honesty reflected in speeches; The BJP would have brought even better results, provided the indiscriminate impetus of new headlines about conversions and then the 'haramjadas' statement that was difficult to remove from the mind would not have spoiled the atmosphere so much
 yah svachh bharat kii kisi bhi surkhi se zyada aakarshak surkhi banaata he
 (disclosure: This columnist has been nominated as the ambassador of Swachh Bharat and has announced a list of nine people on his part to continue the series
 )yah sweekaar karata hum ki modi ko main acchhee tarah nahin jaanata, lekin jitna jaanata hum, main maan hi nahin saktaa ki ghatnachakra ke is tarah ghoomane par ve man hi man khush honge
 Or is it all happening according to his script, as his opponents are now saying
 modi vaajapeyi nahin hai or unhone praturup hone kaa kabhi dhong bhi nahin kiya
 He never hid his faith in Hinduism
 lekin rajdharm kii avadharana ko vah khud apane moulik tareeke se paribhaashit karte hai, vahiin vichaardhaara ke manamaujee upaskon ko khuli chhot dena unki yojana kaa hissaa kabhi nahin rahaa
 He is widely criticized for running a Hindu advocacy government in Gujarat, but if you look at the facts, free of prejudice, then he has a great record of keeping the RSS and VHP, especially Praveen Togadia
 phir ab vah isaki ijaajat kyon de rahe hai? pal bhar ke liye bhi main isse sahamat nahin hum ki modi aisa hi chaahate hai; aakhirkaar vah patibaddh swayamsevak, prachaarak hai
 i accept that this does not match my understanding of his idea and style (which is inadequate)
 in dinon aise aatm-chitranon kaa istemaal kaaphi saavdhaanee se karnaa hota he, lekin lutiyans kii dilli kaa purana khabari hone ke naate main sweekaar karata hum ki main kah nahin saktaa ki meri raay main sach kya haih kya aresas yah sab unki mook sahmati se kar rahaa he (sabase kam sambhaavna he); kya vah yah sab unke, kaaryakartaaon or duniya ke aage yah sabit karne ke liye kar rahaa he ki bos or bada bhai koun he; kya yah parivaar main unhen naapnsad karne vaale togdisson jaison kii sajeesh he; yaa yah aresas kaa apana charitra hi he, sudharne main asamarth aresas? ek baat ab aap kah sakate hai ki yah aalsee safai ki yah sab haashie ke mahatvaheen logon kii bevakoofi kaa namoona bhar he, gale nahin utarati
 Especially not after the Sarsanghchalak has spoken
 kyonki koi bahut hi dussahsee yaa saahsee shaks hi yah kah saktaa he ki sarasanghachaalak haashie ke mahatvaheen vyakti hai
 And i am not both
 ab jab satta main or raajnneeti ke honeymoon daur main unhen chah maheene ho chuke hai, to modi ke liye yah pehla nirnaayak kshan he
 If he is allowed to penetrate his political and moral capital even further, he will risk a real setback within the next two months
 modi itane shaatir to hai hi ki ve is jhanse main nahin aaenge ki kejariwal kii aam aadmi party se laduya maharashtra, haryana, jharkhand or ab kashmir main besahaara congress ko dhul chataane jitna aasaan he
 Kejriwal's resurgence in Delhi is unlikely and if this happens, it could be the end of the honeymoon
 aresas or uski santatiyaan tab jitani chahen utani surkhiyaan bator sakati hai, lekin ve dhire-dhire dhundhlee hokar unki sarkaar ke saath unase dur chali jaaengi
 Does Modi have the courage to say this to him? PS: Away from the pomp of politics, Assam returned to the news with another massacre in tribal districts
 reporter aapako bataaenge ki yah traasadee kaise or kyonkar hui, lekin zyada bada rajnatik mudda saamne rakhaa hi janaa chahieh takreeban 80 baras kii umr paar kar rahe mukhyamantri tarun gogoi ne chaar saal pehle jabase apane dil kaa oparation karavaaya he, tabhi se assam main vaaki koi sarkaar nahin he
 Even the government, which had some grip, lost it after the surprise surprise of the BJP in the general election
 iske liye congress alaakaman jimmedaar he
 He allowed Gogoi to hold office for a very long time, leading his son in the Lok Sabha elections and ignoring the ambitions of hardworking, ambitious and resourceful young leader and now former Health Minister Hemant Biswa Sarma
 unke paas apane ghar kii jameen par palaa-badha ek uttaradhikari tha, lekin use apni sarkaar or party ke saath jang khaane ke liye chhod diya
 The discussion of Chandukhane is that frustrated Sarma expressed his desire to meet Rahul Gandhi and asked what he would have to do to fulfill his ambition to become Chief Minister? Especially when he has not been born in a political house
 lagata he, unhen abhi tak koi jawaab nahin soojha he, isliye taal rahe hai
 Now my question to them is this: If they have decided to hand over polarized Assam to the BJP, by making local Owaisi, Badruddin Ajmal a contractor of Muslim votes, then why take two years to do so? Immediately end the misery of the unfortunate state
 ameena ahamed ne sienen se baat karte hue kaha ki saddaam hossain taanashaah jarur tha lekin use faansee dena puure iraq ke logon ko faansee dene jaisaa he

 iraqi naagarik surung kaa kahana he saddaam hossain shiya or sunni ke bich ghrinaa paidaa kii thi lekin jis tarah unki faansee ko media main dikhaaya gaya vah galat tha
 Recalling things from 10 years ago, Suru said that when Saddam was hanged, people looked quite happy and fired in the air
 yah court kaa nirnay tha or sahi nirnay tha lekin log jis tarah party kar rahe the, galat laga
 Talking to CNN, Niven said when Saddam Hussein was hanged, he was 18 years old and watched TV broadcasts of Saddam Hussein
 nivene kaa kahana he saddaam hossain ko faansee se vah khush nahin thi
 Many of his family started crying during the execution
 nivene kaa kahana he saddaam hossain se uski parivaar ko koi nuksaan nahin pahunchaaya tha
 Saddam did many wrong things he should not have done, but a ruler like Saddam Hussein is needed to rule Iraq
 nivene kaa kahana he, “main or meraa parivaar muslim nahin balki isai he lekin saddaam hossain ne kisi ko yah ijazat nahin diya tha ki vah isai logon ko nuksaan pahunchaae lekin ab halaat karaab hai

 ek or khaas baat ye ki is bade javaabi hamale ko ilaake main tainaat local cmanders ke str par anjaam diya gaya

 com / bb24lb4whe Officials said that Parneet Kaur received a call a few days ago when she was in Delhi to attend the Parliament session
 khud ko ek rashtriyakrut bank kaa prabandhak bataate dete hue, kol karne vaale vyakti ne cor se kaha ki unhen unka vetan jamaa karne ke liye unke bank khate kii jaankaree chahie
 Officials said that eventually he was successful in obtaining the mp's account number, ATM PIN, CVC number and an OTP (one time password)
 police ne bataaya ki cor ko tab ek esemes ke jariye pataa chalaa ki unke khate se 23 lakh rupee kii raashi nikaali gai he
 After which he reported the incident to the police
 patiala ke varisht police adheekshak mandeep singh siddhu ne buudhvaar ko kaha ki aaropee ko giraftaar kar liya gaya he or punjab police kii ek team use jharkhand se laa rahi he
 On November 8, 2016, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi suddenly appeared on TV, no one had any idea what to say
 pataa chalaa ki 500 or 1000 ke note avaidh ghoshit kar die gaye hai or in noton ko ab baikon main jaakar badalawaanaa hoga
 You know the chaos that took place everywhere
 tab bahuton ne sochaa ki shaayad kaala dhan samaapt ho jayega
 The Prime Minister's speech was so emotional that it seemed that something must have been done thoughtfully
 phir achaanak kai maheenon ke baad pradhanmantri ek intervyuu main kehete hai ki sirf notebandi ke aadhaar par unka moolyakan nahin hona chahie
 They no longer even mention demonetisation, at least when the final report comes, they could suddenly come on TV at eight o'clock at night
 balki ab bhi aa sakate hai
 Remember those lines of demonetisation
 khaskar mahilaayein jinke paas apana jamaa kiya hua paisa tha, wo sab patiyon or pitaaon ke haath chalaa gaya
 In one stroke, they had to withdraw money saved for a bad time because they were now illegal
 baad main ve paise laut kar patniyon or betiyon ke haath aae yaa nahin, vahiin bataa sakati hai magar mahilaon se lekar aam kisaanon tak line main lag gaye
 Deposit your money
 9 november 2016 se 30 disambar 2016 tak hi paise waapas ho sakate the
 Everyone said that money is not visible in this line
 yah ek rahasy ban gaya or afvaah bhi
 Then a new gab was introduced to counter it which proved more effective
 vah yah ki ye jo garib log line main lage hai wo darasal apane paise ke liye nahin lage hai
 They become agents of the rich and are engaged in the line taking their commission and depositing it in the Jan Dhan account
 godi media kamaal kaa kaam kar rahaa tha
 At that time, a newspaper journalist from UP wrote that during the demonetisation, the news of public distress is on the inside page and the news of praise on the front page
 phir yah kaha jane laga ki jandhan khate main jinke paise jamaa ho rahe hai unki jaanch hogi
 Those deposited in inactive accounts will be investigated
 aaj tak uskaa pataa nahin chalaa
 Even in the annual report of the Reserve Bank, how much money was deposited in the Jan Dhan accounts was not known till date
 notebandi 2016 main hui thi
 It is August of 2018
 notebandi itani saadhaaran aarthik ghatana nahin thi ki uske bare main reserve bank jab antim report pesh kare to pej number 219 par zikr kare
 Why it took so long, it has been told that the notes have been counted many times, so it took so long
 nateeja kya niklaa
 On 8 November 2016, 15 lakh 41 thousand crore notes of 500 and 1000 were in circulation
 jo waapas aae hai notebandi ke baad unka vailu he 15 lakh 32 hazaar karod
 That is 99
 30 pratishat note waapas bainkon ke zarie pahunch gaye
 After demonetisation, 7,965 crore was spent in printing 500 and 2000 new notes
 sarkaar ko 2016 ke saal main nae note chhapane main 3,421 karod hi kharch karne pade the
 This amount doubled in 2016-17 i
e
 7,965 crore
 sirf 10,000 karod waapas nahin aa sake
 It was said that three four lakh crores will not be returned and will be destroyed
 yaad kiijie us samay whatsap uniwarsity main kya-kya kaha jaataa tha
 The quantity of counterfeit notes was neither high nor close now
 reserve bank kii report main kaha gaya he ki 50 rupee ke jaali noton kii sankhya main 154
 3 percent increase
 pichley saal 2000 ke 638 note pakade gaye or is saal 17,929 pakade gaye
 The report also said that the notes which were returned by some district cooperative banks have not been accepted by the Reserve Bank as the matter is still before the court
 in sahakaarita bainkon main jamaa paise kaa kitna vailu he yah abhi nahin bataaya gaya he
 If it is also included, the percentage of the returned note may increase further
 noton kii vaapasi par jor isliye he kyonki us vakt jor dekar kaha gaya tha ki 2-3 lakh karod bainkon main nahin aa paaenge
 The black money of the rich which is under the pillows and mattress will be shed in the Ganges
 agar sara paisa waapas hi aa gaya to phir ganga main jo bahaya gaya wo kya tha

 Congress President Rahul Gandhi on Thursday held a press conference
 rafel masale par sidhaa aarope lagaaya ki 70 saal kii anbhavi company hindustan aronotics ko rafale deal main hissedaar nahin banaaya gaya, deal se pehle bani aisi company jisaki duusari sahyogi companiyon par kai hazaar karod kii dendaree he use hissedaar kyon banaaya gaya
 Anil Ambani's company has filed a defamation suit of Rs 5000 crore against the Congress party
 par hamaara focus aaj notebandi he
 Perhaps what Sambit Patra is saying is he did not get a chance to say in detail
 unhen bataanaa chahie tha yaa reserve bank ko apni report main bataanaa chahie tha ki 18 lakh khaaton kii jo jaanch hui unase kitna paisa pakadaa gaya jo kaala dhan tha
 Economist Surjit Bhalla has also admitted that the demonetization failed according to the claim of withdrawal of 2-3 lakh crore notes
 magar tex jamaa karne waalon kii sankhya yaa duusare kaarnon kii nazar se dekhen to safal rahi
 In the Economic Survey 2017-18, it is written that most of the new tax returns came from people who did not even have the ability to pay income tax
 ritern kii sankhya to badi magar rajasav par uskaa bahut bada asar nahin hua
 The number of tax collectors still has not increased much
 kya yah sara kuch bina notebandi ke hasil nahin kiya ja saktaa tha
 Several thousand notes were spent in printing new notes
 atm band ho gaye
 What a problem it was
 yahi nahin notebandi ke samay jitna cash market main tha, usase zyada is vakt market main he
 Then what happened to the digital economy? un logon kaa sochie jo aakhir aakhir tak apane paise ko waapas karne ke liye reserve bank ke saamne rote rahe
 Remember that prime time of March 2017
 us samay gaanv dehaat se log apane hi jivan bhar kii kamai lekar rigerv bank ke baahar aakar raat raat bhar rukne lage ki subah note badla jayega
 As of March 31, 2017, the date of exchange of NRI notes was there, while many of them were not changed
 janvari, farvari march kii sardi main log aate rahe
 Imagine how much money was left by the banks
 30-31 march tak to reserve bank ke baahar bheed kaaphi bad gai thi
 Some had a deposit of 4 xxrep 4 0 and some had a deposit of 3 xxrep 4 0 which was destroyed due to not changing
 kya ye bhi kaale dhan vaale the
 At the time of demonetisation, neither reporting properly nor all things could be revealed
 jab hamane prime time ke liye bank series shuru kiya tab kai kaitiyaron ne bataaya ki kaise notebandi ke samay achaanak karodon rupee branch main aa gaye
 Counting new old Noto's eyes got tired and he made a mistake
 kai branch main note ginaney kii mashin nahin thi
 There was an error in counting where the machine was
 kyonki sarkaar ne koi taiyaari nahin kii thi
 As a result of someone's mistake, cashiers have paid a fine ranging from Rs 5000 to Rs 2
5 lakh from their pocket
 hamane tab bhi prime time main dikhaaya tha, fasebuk par likhaa tha, phir se kuch udhaaharan detaa hum kyonki ye baat netaaon ko bhi nahin maaloom he
 i have not revealed the identity to anyone
 tippaniyan On November 10, i gave Rs 16,000 out of my pocket
 us din hamaari shakha subah chaar baje band hui thi
 Worked every day from 10 am to 11 am for 50 days
 maine to 16,000 hi dae baakiyon ne to isse bhi zyada die
 My salary was 25000, 16000 was given in one day
 madhya pradesh kii ek mahila kaisier ko jwine kiye hue do maheene hue the
 18000 was salary
 ek din main hi 20,000 kaa jurmaana bharaa
 a female cashier from Indore had to pay a fine equal to her full salary
 26000 rupee
 a cashier told that we paid a fine of 2 lakh 87 thousand
 jhaansi ke ek bankkarmi ko 2 lakh kaa jurmaana bharna padaa
 For this, he had to take a loan
 patna ke ek kaisier ne bataaya ki notebandi ke samay apni jeb se 13,000 rupee die the
 There was no note counting machine
 itnaa note aa gaya ki ginate ginate galati ho gai
 a cashier from Buxar told that he had to fill 37000 from his pocket
 kanpur dehaat ke kaisier ne likhaa he ki 10,000 jurmaana bharaa
 The cashier of a branch in Gujarat paid a fine of 16,500
 gujarat ke hi ek kaisier ko 2 lakh 87 hazaar bharne pade
 a banker from Delhi wrote that he had to pay a fine of 10,000
 nashik se ek kaisier ne likhaa ki unke or head kaisier ne 56000 rupee die
 Six and a half thousand customers arrived with 16 crores within 6 days
 ek kaisier ne likhaa he ki har din kabhi 10,000 to kabhi 5000 jurmaana bharna padaa
 If all the cashiers send their experience in writing, then we will include it daily in prime time
 jaankaree sahi dijiega lekin
 The Reserve Bank can ask every bank to find out how much money was collected from the cashiers as fine during the demonetisation
 vaise rupaya guuruuvaar ko ek dollar ke 70 rupee 82 paise kaa ho gaya
 Never in history had it fallen so low
 yaad kiijie notebandi kii wo line
 Especially women who had their money deposited, all of it went to husbands and fathers
 ek jatke main kisi bure vakt ke liye bachaa kar rakhe gaye paise nikaal kar dene pade kyonki ve ab ve avaidh ho chuke the
 Later, after returning the money to wives and daughters or not, they can tell there, but from women to common farmers, they got in line
 apana paisa jamaa karaane
 From 9 November 2016 to 30 December 2016, the money could be refunded
 sabane yahi kaha ki is line main paise vaala to dikh nahin rahaa
 It became a mystery and also a rumor
 phir ise counter karne ke liye ek nai gapp udayi gai jo zyaada kargar sabit hui
 That is, these poor people who are engaged in the line are not actually engaged for their money
 ye amiron ke agent banakar unke kamishan lekar line main lage hai or jandhan khate main jamaa kar rahe hai
 The dock media was doing amazing work
 us samay upi ke ek akhbaar ke patrkaar ne likhaa tha ki notebandi ke samay janata kii pareshaani kii khabar bheetar ke panne par hoti he or tarif kii khabar pehle panne par
 Then it was said that the money deposited in the Jan Dhan account would be investigated
 niskriy khaaton main jamaa ho rahe hai unki jaanch hogi
 It has not been found till date
 reserve bank kii salanaa report main bhi nahin he ki jandhan khaaton main jamaa kitna paisa kaala dhan tha, aaj tak pataa nahin chalaa
 Demonetisation took place in 2016
 2018 kaa agast he
 Demonetisation was not such a simple economic phenomenon that when the Reserve Bank presents the final report about it, then refer to page number 219
 itani der kyon lagi to yah bataaya gaya he ki noton ko kai baar gina gaya he isliye itnaa vakt laga
 What was the result? 8 november 2016 ko 500 or 1000 ke 15 lakh 41 hazaar karod ke note cirkulation main the
 Those who have come back after demonetisation have a value of 15 lakh 32 thousand crores
 yani 99
 30 percent of the notes went back to the banks
 notebandi ke baad 500 or 2000 ke nae note chhapane main hi 7,965 karod kharch ho gaye
 In the year 2016, the government had to spend 3,421 crores in printing new notes
 2016-17 main yah raashi dabl ho gai yani 7,965 karod
 10,000 crore just could not come back
 kaha gaya tha ki teen chaar lakh karod waapas nahin aaenge or nasht ho jaaenge
 Remember what was said in whatsapp University at that time
 jaali noton kii maatra na tab zyaada thi na ab band hui he
 The Reserve Bank report states that 154 in the number of counterfeit notes of 50 rupees
 3 pratishat vruddhi hui he
 Last year 638 notes of 2000 were caught and this year 17,929 were caught
 is report main yah bhi kaha he ki kuch zila sahakaarita bainkon main jo note waapas kiye the unhen reserve bank ne abhi sweekaar nahin kiya he kyonki yah maamla abhi adaalat ke saamne he
 The value of the money deposited in these cooperative banks is not yet known
 agar yah bhi shaamil ho jaae to waapas aae note kaa pratishat or bad saktaa he
 The emphasis on return of notes is because it was said at that time that 2-3 lakh crores will not come in banks
 amiron kaa kaala dhan jo takie or gadde ke neeche he ganga main bahaanaa padegaa
 If all the money was returned, then what was it that was shed in the Ganges? purana gadda
 Old Pillow
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne guuruuvaar ko press conferes kii
 It directly accused the Rafale issue that the 70-year-old company Hindustan Aeronautics was not made a shareholder in the Rafale deal, why a company formed before the deal which owes several thousand crores to other affiliates was made a shareholder
 anil ambani kii company ne congress party par 5000 karod kii manahani kaa mukadmaa daayar kiya he
 Our focus on demonetisation today
 sambit paatra jo kah rahe hai shaayad unhen vistaar se kehane kaa mauka nahin mila
 They should have told or told the Reserve Bank in their report how much money was caught from the investigation of 18 lakh accounts which was black money
 arthshaastri surajeet bhalla ne bhi mana he ki 2-3 lakh karod note vaapasi kaa jo daawa tha us hisaab se notebandi fail rahi
 But from the point of view of number of tax collectors or other reasons, it was successful
 2017-18 ke aarthik survey main likhaa he ki jo nae tex ritern aae, unamem se zyaadaatar un logon ke the jinaki iskar dene kii kshamta bhi nahin thi
 The number of returns increased but it did not have a huge impact on revenue
 abhi bhi tex jamaa karne waalon kii sankhya bahut nahin badi he
 Could all this not be achieved without demonetisation
 nae note chhapane main hi kai hazaar note kharch ho gaye
 atms closed
 kitni takalif hui
 Not only this, more cash is in the market at the time of demonetisation than it was in the market
 phir digital iconomi kya hui
 Think of those who kept crying in front of the Reserve Bank to get their money back
 yaad kiijie march 2017 kaa wo prime time
 At that time people from the village countryside came out of the Reserve Bank with their own lifetime earnings and stayed overnight that the note would be changed in the morning
 31 march 2017 tak enarai ke note badale jane kii taarikh thi, jabaki unamem se bhi bahuton kii nahin badali gai
 People kept coming in the months of January, February and March
 sochie kitna paisa bainkon ne aane se rah gaya
 By 30–31 March, the crowd outside the Reserve Bank had increased significantly
 kisi kaa 4 xxrep 4 0 to kisi kaa 3 xxrep 4 0 jamaa niklaa tha jo nahin badale jane ke kaaran nasht ho gaya
 Were they also black-moneyed? notebandi ke samay na to thik se reporting hui na sari baaten saamne aa sakin
 When we started the bank series for prime time, many cashiers told how crores of rupees suddenly came to the branch at the time of demonetisation
 nae puraane noto ko ginate ginate ankhen thak gayi or unase galati hui
 Many branches did not have a note counting machine
 jahaan mashin thi vahaan bhi ginaney main chook hui
 Because the government did not make any preparations
 kisi kii galati kaa nateeja yah hua ki kaitiyaron ne apni jeb se, lone lekar 5000 se lekar dhai lakh tak jurmaana bharaa he
 We still showed it in prime time, wrote on Facebook, again i give some examples because even this is not known to the leaders
 maine pahchaan kisi kii nahin bataai he
 The comments 10 november ko maine apni jeb se 16,000 rupee die
 That day our branch was closed at four in the morning
 50 dinon tak har din subah 10 baje se 11 baje tak kaam karata rahaa
 i have given more than 16,000 leftovers
 meri selary 25000 thi, ek din main 16000 de aayaa
 It took two months to join a female cashier from Madhya Pradesh
 18000 selary thi
 Fined 20,000 in a single day
 indore kii ek mahila kaisier ko apni puri selary ke baraabar jurmaana bharna padaa
 26000 rupees
 ek kaisier ne bataaya ki ham logon ne 2 lakh 87 hazaar kaa jurmaana bharaa
 a bank worker from Jhansi had to pay a fine of Rs 2 lakh
 iske liye use lone lenaa padaa
 a cashier from Patna said that he had given Rs 13,000 from his pocket at the time of demonetisation
 note ginaney kii mashin nahin thi
 So much note came that counting was a mistake
 baxur ke ek kaisier ne bataaya ki use to apni jeb se 37000 bharne pade
 Cashier of Kanpur Dehat has written that 10,000 fine was paid
 gujarat ke ek branch ke kaisier ne 16,500 jurmaana bharaa
 a cashier from Gujarat had to fill 2 lakh 87 thousand
 dilli se ek banker ne likhaa he ki 10,000 kaa jurmaana bharna padaa
 a cashier from Nashik wrote that he and the head cashier gave 56000 rupees
 6 din ke bheetar saadhe chah hazaar graahak 16 karod lekar aa gaye
 a cashier has written that every day he was fined 10,000 or sometimes 5000
 agar saare kaisier apana anubhav likh kar bhejein to ham rose prime time main shaamil karenge
 The information will be correct but reserve bank har bank se puch kar pataa kar saktaa he ki notebandi ke dauraan kaitiyaron se kitna paisa fine ke rup main vasula gaya
 However, the rupee on Thursday became 70 rupees and 82 paise to one dollar
 itihaas main itnaa neeche kabhi nahin gira tha

 Think of those who kept crying in front of the Reserve Bank to get their money back
 yaad kiijie march 2017 kaa wo prime time
 At that time people from the village countryside came out of the Reserve Bank with their own lifetime earnings and stayed overnight that the note would be changed in the morning
 31 march 2017 tak enarai ke note badale jane kii taarikh thi, jabaki unamem se bhi bahuton kii nahin badali gai
 People kept coming in the months of January, February and March
 sochie kitna paisa bainkon ne aane se rah gaya
 By 30–31 March, the crowd outside the Reserve Bank had increased significantly
 kisi kaa 4 xxrep 4 0 to kisi kaa 3 xxrep 4 0 jamaa niklaa tha jo nahin badale jane ke kaaran nasht ho gaya
 Were they also black-moneyed? notebandi ke samay na to thik se reporting hui na sari baaten saamne aa sakin
 When we started the bank series for prime time, many cashiers told how crores of rupees suddenly came to the branch at the time of demonetisation
 nae puraane noto ko ginate ginate ankhen thak gayi or unase galati hui
 Many branches did not have a note counting machine
 jahaan mashin thi vahaan bhi ginaney main chook hui
 Because the government did not make any preparations
 kisi kii galati kaa nateeja yah hua ki kaitiyaron ne apni jeb se, lone lekar 5000 se lekar dhai lakh tak jurmaana bharaa he
 We still showed it in prime time, wrote on Facebook, again i give some examples because even this is not known to the leaders
 maine pahchaan kisi kii nahin bataai he
 The comments 10 november ko maine apni jeb se 16,000 rupee die
 That day our branch was closed at four in the morning
 50 dinon tak har din subah 10 baje se 11 baje tak kaam karata rahaa
 i have given more than 16,000 leftovers
 meri selary 25000 thi, ek din main 16000 de aayaa
 It took two months to join a female cashier from Madhya Pradesh
 18000 selary thi
 Fined 20,000 in a single day
 indore kii ek mahila kaisier ko apni puri selary ke baraabar jurmaana bharna padaa
 26000 rupees
 ek kaisier ne bataaya ki ham logon ne 2 lakh 87 hazaar kaa jurmaana bharaa
 a bank worker from Jhansi had to pay a fine of Rs 2 lakh
 iske liye use lone lenaa padaa
 a cashier from Patna said that he had given Rs 13,000 from his pocket at the time of demonetisation
 note ginaney kii mashin nahin thi
 So much note came that counting was a mistake
 baxur ke ek kaisier ne bataaya ki use to apni jeb se 37000 bharne pade
 Cashier of Kanpur Dehat has written that 10,000 fine was paid
 gujarat ke ek branch ke kaisier ne 16,500 jurmaana bharaa
 a cashier from Gujarat had to fill 2 lakh 87 thousand
 dilli se ek banker ne likhaa he ki 10,000 kaa jurmaana bharna padaa
 a cashier from Nashik wrote that he and the head cashier gave 56000 rupees
 6 din ke bheetar saadhe chah hazaar graahak 16 karod lekar aa gaye
 a cashier has written that every day he was fined 10,000 or sometimes 5000
 agar saare kaisier apana anubhav likh kar bhejein to ham rose prime time main shaamil karenge
 The information will be correct but reserve bank har bank se puch kar pataa kar saktaa he ki notebandi ke dauraan kaitiyaron se kitna paisa fine ke rup main vasula gaya
 However, the rupee on Thursday became 70 rupees and 82 paise to one dollar
 itihaas main itnaa neeche kabhi nahin gira tha
 On 8 November 2016, 15 lakh 41 thousand crore notes of 500 and 1000 were in circulation
 jo waapas aae hai notebandi ke baad unka vailu he 15 lakh 32 hazaar karod
 That is 99
 30 pratishat note waapas bainkon ke zarie pahunch gaye
 After demonetisation, 7,965 crore was spent in printing 500 and 2000 new notes
 sarkaar ko 2016 ke saal main nae note chhapane main 3,421 karod hi kharch karne pade the
 This amount doubled in 2016-17 i
e
 7,965 crore
 sirf 10,000 karod waapas nahin aa sake
 It was said that three four lakh crores will not be returned and will be destroyed
 yaad kiijie us samay whatsap uniwarsity main kya-kya kaha jaataa tha
 The quantity of counterfeit notes was neither high nor close now
 reserve bank kii report main kaha gaya he ki 50 rupee ke jaali noton kii sankhya main 154
 3 percent increase
 pichley saal 2000 ke 638 note pakade gaye or is saal 17,929 pakade gaye
 The report also said that the notes which were returned by some district cooperative banks have not been accepted by the Reserve Bank as the matter is still before the court
 in sahakaarita bainkon main jamaa paise kaa kitna vailu he yah abhi nahin bataaya gaya he
 If it is also included, the percentage of the returned note may increase further
 noton kii vaapasi par jor isliye he kyonki us vakt jor dekar kaha gaya tha ki 2-3 lakh karod bainkon main nahin aa paaenge
 The black money of the rich which is under the pillows and mattress will be shed in the Ganges
 agar sara paisa waapas hi aa gaya to phir ganga main jo bahaya gaya wo kya tha
 Old mattress

 Congress President Rahul Gandhi on Thursday held a press conference
 rafel masale par sidhaa aarope lagaaya ki 70 saal kii anbhavi company hindustan aronotics ko rafale deal main hissedaar nahin banaaya gaya, deal se pehle bani aisi company jisaki duusari sahyogi companiyon par kai hazaar karod kii dendaree he use hissedaar kyon banaaya gaya
 Anil Ambani's company has filed a defamation suit of Rs 5000 crore against the Congress party
 par hamaara focus aaj notebandi he
 Perhaps what Sambit Patra is saying is he did not get a chance to say in detail
 unhen bataanaa chahie tha yaa reserve bank ko apni report main bataanaa chahie tha ki 18 lakh khaaton kii jo jaanch hui unase kitna paisa pakadaa gaya jo kaala dhan tha
 Economist Surjit Bhalla has also admitted that the demonetization failed according to the claim of withdrawal of 2-3 lakh crore notes
 magar tex jamaa karne waalon kii sankhya yaa duusare kaarnon kii nazar se dekhen to safal rahi
 In the Economic Survey 2017-18, it is written that most of the new tax returns came from people who did not even have the ability to pay income tax
 ritern kii sankhya to badi magar rajasav par uskaa bahut bada asar nahin hua
 The number of tax collectors still has not increased much
 kya yah sara kuch bina notebandi ke hasil nahin kiya ja saktaa tha
 Several thousand notes were spent in printing new notes
 atm band ho gaye
 What a problem it was
 yahi nahin notebandi ke samay jitna cash market main tha, usase zyada is vakt market main he
 Then what happened to the digital economy? un logon kaa sochie jo aakhir aakhir tak apane paise ko waapas karne ke liye reserve bank ke saamne rote rahe
 Remember that prime time of March 2017
 us samay gaanv dehaat se log apane hi jivan bhar kii kamai lekar rigerv bank ke baahar aakar raat raat bhar rukne lage ki subah note badla jayega
 As of March 31, 2017, the date of exchange of NRI notes was there, while many of them were not changed
 janvari, farvari march kii sardi main log aate rahe
 Imagine how much money was left by the banks
 30-31 march tak to reserve bank ke baahar bheed kaaphi bad gai thi
 Some had a deposit of 4 xxrep 4 0 and some had a deposit of 3 xxrep 4 0 which was destroyed due to not changing

 At the time of demonetisation, neither reporting properly nor all things could be revealed
 jab hamane prime time ke liye bank series shuru kiya tab kai kaitiyaron ne bataaya ki kaise notebandi ke samay achaanak karodon rupee branch main aa gaye
 Counting new old Noto's eyes got tired and he made a mistake
 kai branch main note ginaney kii mashin nahin thi
 There was an error in counting where the machine was
 kyonki sarkaar ne koi taiyaari nahin kii thi
 As a result of someone's mistake, cashiers have paid a fine ranging from Rs 5000 to Rs 2
5 lakh from their pocket
 hamane tab bhi prime time main dikhaaya tha, fasebuk par likhaa tha, phir se kuch udhaaharan detaa hum kyonki ye baat netaaon ko bhi nahin maaloom he

 If all the cashiers send their experience in writing, then we will include it daily in prime time

 The Reserve Bank can ask every bank to find out how much money was collected from the cashiers as fine during the demonetisation

 nae note chhapane main hi kai hazaar note kharch ho gaye
 atms closed
 kitni takalif hui
 Not only this, more cash is in the market at the time of demonetisation than it was in the market
 phir digital iconomi kya hui
 Think of those who kept crying in front of the Reserve Bank to get their money back
 yaad kiijie march 2017 kaa wo prime time
 At that time people from the village countryside came out of the Reserve Bank with their own lifetime earnings and stayed overnight that the note would be changed in the morning
 31 march 2017 tak enarai ke note badale jane kii taarikh thi, jabaki unamem se bhi bahuton kii nahin badali gai
 People kept coming in the months of January, February and March
 sochie kitna paisa bainkon ne aane se rah gaya
 By 30–31 March, the crowd outside the Reserve Bank had increased significantly
 kisi kaa 4 xxrep 4 0 to kisi kaa 3 xxrep 4 0 jamaa niklaa tha jo nahin badale jane ke kaaran nasht ho gaya
 Were they also black-moneyed? notebandi ke samay na to thik se reporting hui na sari baaten saamne aa sakin
 When we started the bank series for prime time, many cashiers told how crores of rupees suddenly came to the branch at the time of demonetisation
 nae puraane noto ko ginate ginate ankhen thak gayi or unase galati hui
 Many branches did not have a note counting machine
 jahaan mashin thi vahaan bhi ginaney main chook hui
 Because the government did not make any preparations
 kisi kii galati kaa nateeja yah hua ki kaitiyaron ne apni jeb se, lone lekar 5000 se lekar dhai lakh tak jurmaana bharaa he
 We still showed it in prime time, wrote on Facebook, again i give some examples because even this is not known to the leaders
 maine pahchaan kisi kii nahin bataai he
 The comments 10 november ko maine apni jeb se 16,000 rupee die
 That day our branch was closed at four in the morning
 50 dinon tak har din subah 10 baje se 11 baje tak kaam karata rahaa
 i have given more than 16,000 leftovers
 meri selary 25000 thi, ek din main 16000 de aayaa
 It took two months to join a female cashier from Madhya Pradesh
 18000 selary thi
 Fined 20,000 in a single day
 indore kii ek mahila kaisier ko apni puri selary ke baraabar jurmaana bharna padaa
 26000 rupees
 ek kaisier ne bataaya ki ham logon ne 2 lakh 87 hazaar kaa jurmaana bharaa
 a bank worker from Jhansi had to pay a fine of Rs 2 lakh
 iske liye use lone lenaa padaa
 a cashier from Patna said that he had given Rs 13,000 from his pocket at the time of demonetisation
 note ginaney kii mashin nahin thi
 So much note came that counting was a mistake
 baxur ke ek kaisier ne bataaya ki use to apni jeb se 37000 bharne pade
 Cashier of Kanpur Dehat has written that 10,000 fine was paid
 gujarat ke ek branch ke kaisier ne 16,500 jurmaana bharaa

 6 din ke bheetar saadhe chah hazaar graahak 16 karod lekar aa gaye
 a cashier has written that every day he was fined 10,000 or sometimes 5000
 agar saare kaisier apana anubhav likh kar bhejein to ham rose prime time main shaamil karenge
 The information will be correct but reserve bank har bank se puch kar pataa kar saktaa he ki notebandi ke dauraan kaitiyaron se kitna paisa fine ke rup main vasula gaya
 However, the rupee on Thursday became 70 rupees and 82 paise to one dollar
 itihaas main itnaa neeche kabhi nahin gira tha
 In the Economic Survey 2017-18, it is written that most of the new tax returns came from people who did not even have the ability to pay income tax
 ritern kii sankhya to badi magar rajasav par uskaa bahut bada asar nahin hua
 The number of tax collectors still has not increased much
 kya yah sara kuch bina notebandi ke hasil nahin kiya ja saktaa tha
 Several thousand notes were spent in printing new notes
 atm band ho gaye
 What a problem it was
 yahi nahin notebandi ke samay jitna cash market main tha, usase zyada is vakt market main he
 Then what happened to the digital economy? un logon kaa sochie jo aakhir aakhir tak apane paise ko waapas karne ke liye reserve bank ke saamne rote rahe
 Remember that prime time of March 2017
 us samay gaanv dehaat se log apane hi jivan bhar kii kamai lekar rigerv bank ke baahar aakar raat raat bhar rukne lage ki subah note badla jayega
 As of March 31, 2017, the date of exchange of NRI notes was there, while many of them were not changed
 janvari, farvari march kii sardi main log aate rahe
 Imagine how much money was left by the banks
 30-31 march tak to reserve bank ke baahar bheed kaaphi bad gai thi
 Some had a deposit of 4 xxrep 4 0 and some had a deposit of 3 xxrep 4 0 which was destroyed due to not changing
 kya ye bhi kaale dhan vaale the
 At the time of demonetisation, neither reporting properly nor all things could be revealed
 jab hamane prime time ke liye bank series shuru kiya tab kai kaitiyaron ne bataaya ki kaise notebandi ke samay achaanak karodon rupee branch main aa gaye
 Counting new old Noto's eyes got tired and he made a mistake

 There was an error in counting where the machine was
 kyonki sarkaar ne koi taiyaari nahin kii thi
 As a result of someone's mistake, cashiers have paid a fine ranging from Rs 5000 to Rs 2
5 lakh from their pocket
 hamane tab bhi prime time main dikhaaya tha, fasebuk par likhaa tha, phir se kuch udhaaharan detaa hum kyonki ye baat netaaon ko bhi nahin maaloom he

 In West Bengal, the political controversy has increased after the Election Commission's decision to ban any election campaign in 9 Lok Sabha seats after 10 pm on Thursday night
 congress ne chunaav ayog par hamalaa karte hue ise loktantr par kaala dhabba qaraar diya, saath hi kaha ki ayog apni vishwasaneeyata kho chukaa he
 Mayawati also targeted the Commission on the same matter
 chunaav ayog ke faisle par congress ke pravaktaa randit singh surajevaala ne kaha ki chunaav ayog apni nirbhikta or nishpakshta ke liye janaa jaataa rahaa he, lekin ab jab nishpaksh chunaav kii prakriya khatre main he to ayog daraa, thakaa, asahaay or asamanjas kii sthiti main dikh rahaa he
 It seems that the election code of conduct has now become Modi's election campaign code
 ayog ne apni vishsaneeyata kho di he
 The Election Commission Natmastak Congress attacked the Election Commission once again, calling this decision a black spot on democracy
 congress kii ore se randeep singh surajevaala ne kaha ki modi or shah ke aage chunaav ayog natmastak ho gaya he
 The path of Modi's rally of the Commission's decision has been cleared
 unhone kaha ki aaj jab loktantr par modi, shah or bijepi dwaara sidhaa hamalaa bolaa ja rahaa he, tab chunaav ayog daraa, thakaa or asahaay hokar prajatantr kaa chiraharan hote hue dekh rahaa he
 He said that the way BJP goons in Kolkata broke the idol of Ishwar Chand Vidyasagar and still no action was taken
 surajevaala ne ayog kii aalochana karte hue kaha ki kal jis tarah chunaav ayog ne pashchim bengal main 19 ghante pehle chunaav prachaar ko roak diya, ye desh ke prajatantr par kaala dhabba he
 Why did the commission stop campaigning after 10 pm tonight, 24 hours after the incident
 aisa lagata he ki ayog ke faisle se pradhanmantri narendra modi kii aaj mathurapur or damdam main hone vaali do reliyon ke liye free paas de diya gaya he
 The Congress said that this order has tainted the practice of Article 324 of the Constitution and the convention and beliefs of Articles 14 and 21
 aisa lagata he ki chunaav ayog kaa yah aadesh modi ke liye gift he
 Election Commission powerless and mute spectator Congress spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala said that the kind of violence and hooliganism was done in Kolkata
 amit shah us road sho kaa netritv kar rahe the, unako sajaa dene ke bajaae chunaav ayog yah kah rahaa he ki wo shaktiheen or mookadarshak he
 Have Modi and Amit Shah forcibly captured the fairness and boldness of the Election Commission? Today, the citizen of the country wants answers to some questions from the Election Commission
 surajevaala ne kaha ki congress ne sabooton ke saath 11 shikaayatein darj karai thi, jisamen narendra modi or amit shah dwaara chunaav aachaar samhita kaa ghor ulanghan kiya gaya tha
 Despite this, why no action was taken by the Election Commission
 modi or shah lagaataar aachaar samhita tod rahe hai
 Mayawati lashed out at the Election Commission, saying that the Commission has banned election campaigning in West Bengal from 10 pm to 10 pm because of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's two election rallies in Bengal during the day
 agar chunaav ayog ne prachaar par bain lagaaya he to subah se hi kyon nahin?haalanki congress ke itar bihar main bijepi kii saathi jediu ne isi maamle par bengal sarkaar ko barkhaast karne kii maang kii he

 Atal Bihari Vajpayee is also one of the faces who laid the foundation of Jana Sangh, Janata Party and later BJP
 6 april 1980 ko bijepi kaa gathan hua, ek raajnneetik dal ke rup main pehle loksabhaa chunaav main party ke khate main mahaj do siten hi ai thi
 Despite this, Vajpayee did not give up and he had said, 'the darkness will come, the sun will come out, the lotus will bloom
 ' isi kaa nateeja he ki maujuuda samay main centre kii satta se lekar desh kii 20 rajyon main bijepi kii sarkarein hai
 Click here to pay tribute to Atalji
 Atal Bihari Vajpayee was born on 25 December 1924, this day is called the big day in India
 philhal swasthya kharaab hone ke kaaran wo sakriy raajnneeti se alag hai, unki tabiyat bighad jane ke jane chalate unhen dilli ke ames main bhartee karaayaa gaya tha
 When the BJP made an entry in the political history of the country, hardly anyone would have thought that one day the party would be taking power in half of the country
 bijepi ko shunya se shikhar tak pahunchane main vaajapeyi ne sabase ahm bhoomika adaa kii
 Vajpayee entered politics in 1942, when his brother went to jail for 23 days during the Quit India Movement
 1951 main vaajapeyi ne aresas ke sahyog se bhartiya jansangh party banaai jisamen shyama prasad mukherjee jaise netaa shaamil hue
 In 1957, Vajpayee became a member of Rajya Sabha for the first time by winning the election from Balrampur parliamentary seat
 vaajapeyi ke asaadhaaran vyaktitv ko dekhakar us samay ke vartmaan pradhanmantri pandit jawaharlal nehru ne kaha tha ki aane vaale dinon main yah vyakti jarur pradhanmantri banegaa
 In 1968, Vajpayee became the National President of the National Jana Sangh
 us samay party ke saath nanaaji deshmukh, balraj madhok tathaa laalkrishna adwani jaise netaa the
 Vajpayee was arrested along with other leaders during the Emergency in 1975-77 when he was criticizing Indira Gandhi for the Emergency
 1977 main janata party ke mahanayake jaiprakash narayan ke netritv main apatkaal kaa virodh ho rahaa tha
 After his release from jail, Vajpayee merged the Jan Sangh with the Janata Party
 1977 main hue loksabhaa chunaav main janata party kii jeet hui thi or ve morarji bhai desai ke netritv vaali sarkaar main videsh maamalon ke mantri bane
 After becoming the foreign minister, Vajpayee was the first leader to address the United Nations Federation in Hindi
 janata party kii sarkaar 1979 main gir gai, lekin us samay tak vaajapeyi ne apane aapaki ek anbhavi netaa va vaktaa ke rup main pahchaan bana lee
 After this, the Janata Party disintegrated due to infighting and in 1980 the old friends along with Vajpayee left the Janata Party and joined the Bharatiya Janata Party
 vaajapeyi bijepi ke pehle rashtriya adhyaksh bane or ve congress sarkaar ke sabase bade aalochakon main shumaar kiye jane lage
 In 1994, when the party won elections in Karnataka, 1995 in Gujarat and Maharashtra, then the then President of the party, LK Advani, declared Vajpayee as the Prime Ministerial candidate
 vaajapeyi 1996 se lekar 2004 tak 3 baar pradhanmantri bane
 In the 1996 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP emerged as the largest party in the country and Vajpayee became the Prime Minister for the first time
 haalanki unki sarkaar 13 dinon main sansad main purna bahumat hasil nahin karne ke chalate gir gai
 In the 1998 Lok Sabha elections, the party won more seats and with the support of some other parties, Vajpayee formed the NDA and he again became the Prime Minister
 yah sarkaar 13 maheenon tak chali, lekin bich main hi jayalalita kii party ne sarkaar kaa saath chhod diya jiske chalate sarkaar gir gai
 The BJP returned to power in the 1999 Lok Sabha elections and this time Vajpayee completed his term

 bhaajapa ko samarthan dene ke liye ensipiadhyaksh sharad pavaar (sharad Pawar) ne do sharte rakhi thim
 The first condition was for the daughter of Supriya Sule, who was active in the politics of the Center, to make a huge Chief Minister in place of Agriculture Ministry and second, Devendra Fadnavis
 jab yah baat pradhanmantri narendra modi ke saamne ai to vah sarkaar banane ke liye in sharton ko maanane ko taiyaar nahin hue
 BJP sources said that the party leadership felt that if the NCP was given the Ministry of Agriculture to garner support in Maharashtra, then the old ally JD (U) in Bihar could create chaos by staking claim to the Railway Ministry
 aise main prachand bahumat ke baavjood do bade mantralay bhaajapa ke haath se nikal sakate hai
 Sources told about Pawar's second condition that in the state like Maharashtra, Devendra Fadnavis managed to run the power uninterrupted for five years and in the assembly elections also the party contested by making him the face of the Chief Minister, the results came on October 24
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi, while addressing the workers at the party headquarters on the day, announced the formation of a government under the leadership of Fadnavis After this, it was impossible for the BJP to accept the condition of Fadnavis as CM instead of another
 sutron kaa kahana he ki in donon maangon ko maanane ke liye sharad pavaar ne bhaajapa or modi-shah ko sandesh bhejkar vichaar ke liye vakt diya tha
 This is the reason why after the results, Pawar had not spoken anything sharp against the BJP leadership, on which there was scope for a retaliatory response from the BJP
 bayaanbaji sirf shivasena or bhaajapa ke bich hoti rahi
 Sources say that on November 20, when Sharad Pawar met Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Parliament House, there was a 45-50 minute long conversation when the BJP did not get a positive stand on the demands
 haalanki is mulaakaat main bhi pradhanmantri narendra modi sharad pavaar kii donon maangon par raji nahin hue or na hi unhone khulkar kuch kaha
 Meanwhile, on 22 November, Sharad Pawar's nephew Ajit Pawar rebelled and offered to form a government with the BJP
 shuruaati khabaron main kaha gaya ki ajit pavaar ke saath 30-35 vidhayak tuutakar bhaajapa ke saath sarkaar banane ke liye taiyaar hai
 It is also said that Sharad Pawar also has a silent consensus in this
 magar baad main sharad pavaar ne twit kar bhaajapa ke saath rakanpa ke gathbandhan kii baat khaarij karte hue kaha ki sarkaar main shaamil hone kaa ajit pavaar kaa faisla nijee he
 Sources reveal that till the end Sharad Pawar was hopeful that the BJP, helpless due to leaving with Shiv Sena, would accept both his big demands, but this did not happen
 aakhirkaar sharad pavaar ne congress or shivasena ke saath hi sarkaar banane kaa antim kadam uthaaya
 Sharad Pawar knew that he had ladders in both his hands as he had 54 mlas
 ek taraf jane par unke sir par chanakya banane kaa sehara bandhegaa or bhaajapa kii taraf jane par centre sarkaar main bhagidaari sahit adhiktam laabh milane kii gunjaaish he
 Dilip Deodhar of Nagpur, who is aware of Sangh and BJP affairs, said, "there was a lot of discussion of these two terms of Sharad Pawar in the Sangh Parivar, although even more discussion was not to succumb to the pressures of Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 maharashtra main kisaanon kaa pramukh mudda hone ke kaaran vahaan kii raajnneeti ke liye krishi mantralay kaaphi mufeed rahata he
 Sharad Pawar has also served as Agriculture Minister in the past
 doosraa mukhyamantri pad ke liye fadanvis modi kii hi khoj rahe hai, aise main unhen sidline karne kaa prashn hi nahin uthta tha
 When Sharad Pawar felt that the BJP was not going to accept his demands, he finally decided to bring the talks going on with the congress-shiv Sena to form the government beforehand
 madhya pradesh or rajasthan vidhansabha chunaav ko lekar supreme court ne chunaav ayog ko notice jari kiya he

 apane pehle world cap match main paanch wicket jhatakane kaa karnama karne vaale sohail 9wein cricketer ban gaye hai
 Sohail's tight bowling was such that the Indian batsmen started scoring runs as soon as they were removed from bowling, but as soon as they were brought back to the death overs, the Pakistani bowlers again dominated
 deth overs main apni shandaar gendbaaji se sohail ne bhartiya ballebaajon ko bamushkil 300 ranon ke aankade ko chune diya
 Wahab Riaz, who had taken 5 wickets in the last World Cup (2011) semi-finals from one end, was bowling brilliantly and was not letting him make more than four-five runs in his over, then Sohail from the other end with tight bowling wickets

 is kavita sangrah ke gudh naam par mat jaaie
 This is the first attempt of Poonam Sinha 'shreyasi' and her fifty-one poems published in this collection make her debut in the literary world
 sangrah kii pehali kavita 'phir milenge ham' he
 As the title itself suggests, it is a poem full of hopes of meeting my beloved again
 lekin hamane or aapane aisi kam se kam do sau kavitaayen pehle hi pard rakhi hai
 Especially, in the era of Facebook and social media, where everyone is a poet, such poetry does not affect at all
 punam sinha kii kavitaaon main tatsam shabdon kaa prayog adhik he
 But in some of his poems, such words seem to stop the flow of language rather than communication
 lekin, jaise hi sangrah kii kavita kachua aati he, vahaan se punam sinha ke kavitaaon kaa ek nayaa or taazgi bharaa tevar dekhne ko miltaa he
 See the hallmark of some of his poems: combs, scissors, brooms, and needles
 un kavitaaon main punam sinha sarvshereshth he
 Short lines and easy-flowing ideas
 parvat kaa dukh main vah likhti hai,maati yun hi nahiparvat bana hogakitna banta-banta sakisi kaa na ho sakaa hoga
 He is communicative in many poems from his three, three, four-word verse lines, and should have remained in this style, but by going to the last pages he would include a lyrical poem, Re Pathik Tikin Tu Suna Jaa himself
 Could not stop kul milakar apni chir-parichit style ko agar punam barkaraar rakh paati hai, to unke duusare sangrah main sudhaar or vikaas kii gunjaaish adhik he

 The impact it has on the poor sections of our society and on business is far more harmful than any economic indicator
 'purv pradhanmantri ne kaha, 'iskaa (notebandi kaa) turant asar naukariyon par padaa he
 Three-quarters of our country's non-agricultural employment is in the field of small and medium enterprises

 So jobs are gone and new jobs are not being created
 'unhone kaha, 'main notebandi ke dirghakaalik asar ke bare main chintit hum
 Although reforms are showing after the recent decline in GDP, increasing inequality is a major threat to the nature of our economic growth
 notebandi ise badha sakati he, jise bhavishya main sudhaarna kathin hoga

 Accusing the UPA government of the Center of ignoring the development of Uttar Pradesh, a member of the Samajwadi Party said in the Rajya Sabha that the Prime Minister should immediately call a special meeting and discuss the issues related to the development of the state
 sapa ke naresh agarwal ne shoonyakaal main yah mudda uthaate hue kaha ki uttar pradesh ke vikaas kii kaaphi samay se andekhi kii ja rahi he
 He said that Uttar Pradesh is a big state of the country
 isi kaaran rajya se jude muddon par vichaar-vimarsh karne ke liye pradhanmantri rajya ke mukhyamantri ke saath baithak bulaate the
 He said that such a meeting was called till the reign of the NDA government, but no such meeting was called after the current UPA government came to power
 agarwal ne kaha ki haal hi main upi ke mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav pradhanmantri se milane nayi dilli aae the
 He said that during this meeting, Akhilesh did not ask for any special package for the state, but did say about the release of some funds which the state gets under centrally sponsored schemes
 unhone kaha ki kai aise mudde hai jin par centre ko rajya kii fouran madad kerani chahie
 These include the devastation caused in the state due to flood waters in the rivers coming from Nepal, not having a single SEZ in the state, no mega project for power generation
 agarwal ne kaha ki in muddon par vichaar-vimarsh ke liye pradhanmantri ko fouran vishesh baithak bulani chahie

 Nupur may well be sitting inside the jail and running a pen to hide the mystery of this case

 Significantly, the trial of the case in Ghaziabad sessions court, cbi's plea against Rajesh Talwar's bail in Allahabad High Court and Nupur's reconsideration petition are registered in the Supreme Court
 ek taraf to noopur talwaar court kii sunwaayee taalane ke liye har mumkin koshish main juty hai or duusari taraf sach saamne laane ke liye kitaab likhane kaa daawa kar rahi hai

 main spasht kar duun ki vah film athiya par kendrit honi chahie or papa uske sahaayak kirdaar ke taur par kaam karenge
 not otherwise
 " athiya ne varsh 2015 main film 'hero' ke saath kariyar kii shuruyaat kii thi or vartmaan main vah duusari film 'mubaarakan' kii shooting main vyast hai

 ) Her father believes that she is developing over time
 unhone kaha, "vah adhik aashwast ho gai hai
 i am seeing a different person in Athiya

 " (hedline ke alaava, is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he, yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he
 ) (except for the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it is published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) This decision is being justified by the responses from the political corridors
 bharat kii sabase puraani party ne purvi uttar pradesh main jeet hasil karne kii chunauti ke liye priyanka ko utaara he
 For the last few months, the Congress has been ahead in creating whisper in the political corridor
 isaki yah ek or misaal he
 Sources said that this task would not have been so easy for this loyalist, as efforts were on to free the party from the old people, and this work would in some way be seen as a return of that loyalist
 haalanki sanyas le chuke netaa jo charchaa se dur rahe hai, vah congress ke pratham parivaar ke najdiki hai or centre main jab party satta main thi to vah sonia gandhi ke nijee kaksh tak pahunch rakhte the
 It is possible that their relationship has worked, as they have brought forward Priyanka Vadra in an important role
 bataaya jaataa he ki congress mahasachiv ke taur par unki niyukti ke liye uthaae gaye kadam par sonia gandhi kii salaah lee gai he
 The Congress president said during a rally in Odisha on Friday that his appointment was not a sudden decision
 yah vafaadaar bharat kii raajnneeti main kaaphi pratishthit vyakti he or ateet main unhone niyantran se baahar ho chuke halaat ko sanbhaalane main ahm bhoomika nibhaai thi
 However, it is believed that this is a strategic decision of the Congress party, which has been taken keeping in mind the upcoming steps
 priyanka wadra ko uttar pradesh dekar rahul gandhi ne kaha ki unako pradesh main party ko jitaane kii jimmedaari di gai he
 This sends the message that the Congress President is now free to manage the rest of the country
 jab amethi kii aam janata ne buudhvaar subah amethi kii sthiti ko lekar shikaayat kii to unhone kaha ki unako chintaa nahin kerani chahie, kyonki vah dilli se dawa bhej rahe hai
 Within an hour of announcing his debut in politics, the news spread like wildfire
 priyanka ke raajnneeti main aane se jo sabase badi samanta aane vaali he, vah yah he ki gandhi parivaar ke sansadeey kshetra amethi or raibareli ke alaava bhi uttar pradesh main yuva or bujurg sabhi varg ke log unke saath hai
 There is speculation that there may be differences between the brothers and sisters in the days to come
 yah bhi kaha ja rahaa he ki loksabhaa chunaav main agar congress majboot banakar ubhartee he or rahul agar centre sarkaar main bade puraskaar ko lekar anicchhuk rahete hai, to bahan priyanka wadra ko netritv kii bhoomika main vikalp ke taur par pesh kiya ja saktaa he

 He said his team had estimated a March earthquake in Japan and another earthquake earlier this month
 haalanki unka kahana tha ki in bukampon se srilanka prabhavit nahin hoga, lekin yadi indonesia main 10 or 17 april ke bich ke sambhavit bukamp se tsunami aa gaya, to usase srilanka par bhi asar padegaa

 One of the most awaited films of 2019, 'ek Ladki Ko Dekha Toh Aisa Laga' is going to be special in many ways
 is film main pehali baar anil kapur or sonam kapur saath kaam karte hue nazar aaenge
 The story of the film is based on an uncharted lovestory
 sonam or anil kapur ke saath hi film main rajkumaar raav or juhi chawla bhi ahm bhoomikaaon main nazar aaengi
 It is directed by Shaily Chopra Dhar and is produced by Vidhu Vinod Chopra Films and Rajkumar Hirani Films
 anil kapur or rajkumaar raav ne isse pehle film phanne khan main saath kaam kiya tha
 Aishwarya Rai was also seen in this film
 haalanki film box offis par dhadaam ho gai thi
 This is why Rajkumar and Anil's expectations from their new film have risen considerably
 is film ke trailor ko darshakon kii acchhee pratikriya mil rahi he
 However, there is a big change in the posters of the film
 isse pehle poster main vinod chopra films or rajkumaar hiraani films saath main ko-producers ke taur par nazar aae the
 Rajkumar Hirani directed the film Sanju last year and gave a new direction to Ranbir Kapoor's career
 haalanki film ke nae poster main ko-produsar ke taur par rajkumaar hiraani kaa naam hataa diya gaya he
 However, it is difficult to say whether this is due to a simple mistake or there is some other reason behind the removal of the name

 Vahe Guru Ji Da Khalsa, Vahe Guru Ji Di Fateh
 
 
 jo bole so nihaal, satshri akaal
 These are some of the slogans that are echoing in every gurudwara these days
 har gurudware main gurunanak sahib kii jayanti ke liye khaas taiyaari kii ja rahi he
 Although every gurudwara is special in itself but today we will tell you about that gurudwara which was established by Gurunanak Saheb himself
 jab 1505 main gurunanak ji pehali baar dilli aae the tab unhone is gurudware kii sthapana kii thi, isiilie ye gurudwara sikh samudaay ke liye khaasaa mahatv rakhata he
 Harvinder Singh chairman, Nanak Piyau Gurdwara, says that it is a very ancient gurdwara and the first gurdwara in Delhi
 isliye ham yahaan bade hi utsaah ke saath ye jayanti manaate hai
 How the name was named, 'nanak Pyau Gurudwara' This Gurudwara is named after Nanak Pyau Gurudwara
 ab aap log soch rahe honge kii is gurudware kaa naam nanak pyau kyon he? bhala ye kaisaa naam hua? to aapako bataate he is naam ke peeche kii puri kahani
 Actually, when Guru Nanak came to Delhi for the first time, he stayed at this place
 aaj is jagah ko jiti karnal road ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 It is said at that time that drinking water in this area was not destined
 jameen se khaaraa pani nikalataa tha, jiske kaaran log pareshaan ho rahe the
 The health of the children was deteriorating
 tabhigurunanak sahibane apni shakti se, apni drushti se, jameen se meetha pani nikaala
 After which all the people living here drank water here
 jiske baad unhen ho rahi bimaariyaan bhi khatm ho gayi
 This sequence continues even after 500 years, that is today
 aaj bhi kune se meetha pani nikalataa he
 Today there is a drink here
 isi kaaran is gurudware kaa naam nanak pyau gurudwara rakhaa gaya tha
 People here believe that people from all over the country come here and drink this water, after which all their troubles, all diseases end
 500 saalon se chalaa aa rahaa he lungarnanak pyau gurudware main sabase pehle lungar khud gurunanak ji ne shuru kiya tha or tab se ab tak yani 500 saalon se yahaan lungar isi tarah chalata aa rahaa he
 Thousands of people come here everyday to eat
 koi bhi bhookha nahin jaataa 
 Lakkha Singh says that for 500 years the langar has been going on in this way
 magar gurunanak ji kii jayanti ke upalaksh main yahaan pakwaan banaaye ja rahe hai
 From pea cheese, mix veg to kheer, arrangements have been made here
 yahaan is utsav ko dekh aisa lagata he jaise khud gurunanak ji yahaan maujuud hon or unka janmdin manaaya ja rahaa ho
 On this day, women too do not hesitate to serve for the langar
 gurudwaron main khaas taiyaariyandilli ke gurudwaron main lungar se lekar sajaavat tak khaas taiyaari kii ja rahi hai
 Gurunanak Sahebki 548th Birth Anniversary
 sikh samudaay ke liye isse bada parv or koi nahin 
 Due to this, festivals are celebrated from homes to gurdwaras
 pakwaan banaaye jate hai, sajaavat kii jaati he
 
 kek kaata jaataa he or gurudwaron main kirthan kiya jaataa he
 Since Guru Nanak Saheb had established this Nanak Piau, due to this special preparations are being made here
 gurudware ke kone-kone ko phulon se sajaayaa ja rahaa he
 The entire gurudwara is decorated with light
 yah kahana galat nahin hoga ki dilli main gurunanak ji kii jayanti manane ke liye tamaam taiyaariyaan kar lee gai hai or ab aane vaale do dinon tak gurudwaron main khaasi raunak rahegi
 Recently Armaan Kohli was accused by his girlfriend Neeru Randhawa of beating him severely, after which Armaan was lodged in an FIR
 kai dinon tak faraar rahane ke baad armaan ko giraftaar kar liya gaya

 The Bombay High Court has dismissed Armaan, dismissing the case

 No one is aware of where Armaan is going on the holiday

 After the breakup from Armaan, this is Neeru Randhawa's plan Neeru Randhawa has also made a plan to come out of his bad mood

 china main ye kahawat bhale hi prachlit naa ho
 But China has become the perfect example of this proverb, buoyed by the Dalai Lama's visit to Arunachal Pradesh
 ab ham ek ek karke china ke man main dalai lamas se nafrat or arunachal pradesh ko lekar laalach kii vajah ke bare main bataate hai
 But first let us tell you why China is so irritated with the 81-year-old Dalai Lama? Actually the history of hostility between China and the Dalai Lama is the history of china-tibet relationship
 1
 Turning the pages of history shows that until the 12th century, Tibet was an independent country, which remained a disputed place between India and China
 2
 Tibet has a centuries-old relationship with India
 angrejon ke jamaane main tibet main bhartiya rail chalati thi
 3
 tibet main bhartiya daakghar or bhartiya police maujuud thi
 4
 bhartiya sena kii ek tukdi bhi tibet kii raksha ke liye tainaat thi
 5
 tibet main bhartiya mudra chalati thi
 6
 bhutan kii tarah tibet bhi videshi or suraksha ke maamle main bharat par nirbhar tha
 7
 bharat kii azaadi ke baad china ne tibet ko hadap liya or apana hissaa bana liya8
 When the people of Tibet opposed this move of China, China started breaking the Buddhist monasteries of Tibet and harassing the Dalai Lama, the greatest religious leader of Tibet
 9
 In 1959, the Chinese army conspired to arrest the Dalai Lama in Lhasa to crush the ongoing struggle for Tibet
 jab china kii sena dalai lamas ko giraftaar karke beijing le janaa chaahati thi to dalai lamas raaton raat apane saikadon sahyogiyon ke saath bhagkar bharat aa gaye
 10
 china ne bharat se dalai lamas ko lautaane ke liye kaha lekin tatkaaleen pradhanmantri pandit nehru is par raji nahin hue
 Since then, China has been declaring the Dalai Lama its enemy and the separatist leader of Tibet
 tibet ke dharmaguru dalai lamas se china kii chidh ke bare main shaayad hi ab aapke man main koi sawaal baaki rah gaya ho
 But now if you are wondering why China has so much objection when the Dalai Lama goes to Arunachal Pradesh, then the answer to this question is also hidden in the trick of China
 darasal baat ye he ki china arunachal pradesh kii 90 hajaar varg kilometre jameen par apana daawa karata he
 Mainly considers Tawang in Arunachal Pradesh as part of South Tibet
 china kahata he ki 15veen shatabdi ke dalai lamas kaa janm tawang main hua tha, isliye tawang tibet kaa hissaa he
 But the truth is that in 1914, representatives of Azad Tibet handed over the area of tawang to India in a meeting held in Shimla
 china ne 1959 main tibet par kabja jamaane or dalai lamas ke bharat bhagkar aane tak is mudde par koi aitraaj nahin jataayaa tha
 But after the indo-china war in 1962, China occupied the whole of Arunachal Pradesh including Tawang
 haalanki baad main wo arunachal pradesh main bharat-china border line, jise macmohan rekha kehete hai
 Had returned from him
 tab se abtak is vivaad ko sulajhane ke liye bharat or china ke bich ab tak 15 baar baatcheet bhi ho chuki he
 But they have proved to be uninteresting
