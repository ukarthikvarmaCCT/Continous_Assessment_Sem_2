 The Information Commission has once again ordered the Prime Minister's Office to provide information sought from the RTI about the facts related to the CBI probe into the forest scams during the Bhupinder Singh Hooda government in Haryana
 soochna ayog ne artiai kaaryakarta subhash agarwal kii yachika par mangalvaar ko saat pannon kaa aadesh paas kiya

 aap satyabrat mitra ko nahin jaanate honge
 Any Satyabrata Mitra can be from among you
 satyabrat mitra hone kaa matlab he, ek ghar kareedne kaa sapana
 Every day someone tries to contact that such and such builder is not giving flat for three to four years
 jab ham apane kisi samvaadadaata se kehete hai ki to khud hi dukhi ho jaataa he ki hamaara bhi flats chaar saal se nahin mil rahaa he
 All are trapped in this cycle
 media ne koi pehali baar is masale ko jor shor se nahin uthaaya he
 All the channels from newspaper to time have been raising this issue from time to time, but no one is relieved
 satyabrat mitra ne saal 2010 main greater noida west main arth infrastracchar ke project arth toun main ghar book karaayaa tha
 Satyabrata claims that the builder had claimed in the brochure that the flat would be found by 15 August 2012
 2016 aa gaya he, magar flats nahin mila he
 The battle to acquire this flat changed the life of Satyabrata
 10 pratishat paisa dene ke baad bhi builder se agreement nahin mila to satyabrat mitra kii ladaai shuru ho gai
 He had to give 40 percent money after losing, then he got a copy of the agreement in May 2011
 agreement kii copy dekhi to kai badlaavon ko dekh hairaan rah gaye
 There was a lot of difference between the brochure and the agreement
 builder ne 100 varg foot kaa super aria badha diya, jiske kaaran unako 2 lakh rupee or dene pade
 Not only this, the date of giving home in 2012 also changed
 agreement main likhaa hua tha ki agreement banane ke 36 maheene ke baad ghar milegaa
 That is, you will get 2014 instead of 2012
 lekin is bich kisaan apane muaavze ko lekar court pahunch gaye or kaam band ho gaya
 Not only this, the builder had earlier promised that in addition to the ground floor, 14 floors would be built, 29 towers would be built, but in the agreement it was written that the ground floor plus 19 floor towers would be built
 satyabrat or unke saath tamaam tarah kii athurity se chitthee patari karte rah gaye magar koi laabh nahin hua
 Then went to Allahabad High Court
 vahaan se tarikh hi mil rahi he, sunwaayee hi ho rahi he magar flats nahin mila he
 After this, some buyers filed a writ petition together
 rit main kaha ki karidaaron ko muawza milanaa chahie
 The court ordered the Greater Noida Authority to call buyers and builders to find a solution
 ek maheenaa ho gaya he is aadesh kaa, abhi tak builder or karidaar kii baithak nahin hui he
 These people have also spoken in front of UP Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav
 builder ke diarector ke khilaaf exiaar bhi darj ho chuki he
 i am counting every single thing, so that you can understand how many people are upset with you if you do not get a flat, then where do they go, whom do they meet, but nothing happens
 ant main yah samajhate hai ki chalo media ke paas
 Go there too, the news goes on, but nothing happens
 netaaon ko lagata he ki aapako bhavuk karne ke liye tamaam mudde hai hi to in sab samasyaon ko akele kii ladaai ke liye chhod diya jaae
 By the way, your emotional issues also work
 pichley chaar paanch saal se desh bhar ke alag alag shaharon main das se pachaas, pachaas se sau karidaar milakar pradarshan kar rahe hai
 Upload those performances to Facebook
 twitor par daalate hai, taaki vahaan maujuud jaagruk deshbhakt log baaki deshbhakton ke saath ho rahi is ninsaphi par hangaamaa machaa denge, magar hota kuch nahin he
 It is important that you get familiar with the names of these organizations made by the common people
 FEDRATIONS OF APARTMENT OWNERS ASSOCIATION ke tahat 88 houseing sosayadi ke log jude hue hai
 The page of NEFOWA- NEW ERA FLAT OWENRS WELFARE ASSOCIATION shows that there are 9672 members
 NEFOMA- NOIDA ESTATE FLAT OWNER MAIN ASSOCIATION ke fasebuk par 10,206 sadsy hai
 KOLKATA WEST INTERNATIONAL CITY BUYERS WELFARE ASSOCIATION has 4087 likes on its page
 TRIVENI FARIDABAD ALLOTTIES ASSOCIATION ke 2700 sadsy hai, jinamein se 300 biguef ke jawan hai
 In addition, there are many organizations like AMRAPALI VERONA HEIGHTS FLAT BUYERS ASSOCIATION, EARTH TOWN BUYERS, PARAMOUNT APARTMENT OWNER ASSOCIATIONS
 maine naam isliye bataaye, taaki aapako pataa chal sake ki tamaam sanghathanon ke is desh main bilderon se pareshaan logon ne kitne tarah ke sanghathan bana liye hai
 They are fighting a long battle at their own level
 kabhi dilli aakar rahul gandhi se milte hai, to lakhanu jaakar akhilesh yadav se milte hai
 Union minister also weeps in front of Venkaiah Naidu
 magar kuch nahin hota he
 Not only this, from mlas to mps, the door is knocked
 har jagah se haar kar builder ke darvaaze par tarah tarah ke pradarshan bhi karte hai
 You can also see the picture of a different type of civil movement being created due to their problems so that you can get an idea and you can be alert that you will not have to perform in this way
 hamane kuch tasviren inke fasebuk pej se lee hai
 These people even took off their clothes so that everyone could be noticed
 is tasviir main log munh par pattee baandhe hue hai
 You can see a long rally in this picture
 yahaan to log sadak par hi baith gaye hai
 Somewhere Anna's hat starts to appear, as if seeing this hat, the builder fears a future Kejriwal and gives it a flat, then some one has become Gandhi
 gandhi par yah bharosa laajawab he
 One must research how many demonstrations in India are called for in a year
 gandhi kii aatma kya vaaki logon ko pareshaan karne vaale paramatmaon ko kuch badal paati hogi
 New new types of slogans are coming out
 amrapali itani der lagaae ki dada makaan book karaaye or pota posation paae
 a slogan is bread cloth and lies
 
 
 sthaneey se lekar dilli sthit rashtriya media main in sab pradarshnon kii pej number ek se lekar das ke bheetar tasviren chap jaati hai
 These people make clippings and move around
 ham sabakaa dhyaan do chaar raajnneetik dalon ke pravaktaaon par hi rahata he, lekin kisi samajashastri ko jaakar dekhnaa chahie ki flats kii pareshaani ne kis tarah se middle class ko sakriy kar diya he
 He is colliding with all kinds of institutions
 hataash ho rahaa he or is prakriya main khud bhi badal rahaa he
 Our colleague Mihir removed some more pictures from Facebook that need your attention
 bilderon se pareshaan karidaar site kaa daura karte rahete hai
 Keep looking at your dreams when it will be achieved
 kab banegaa
 In this affair, they also act as cids
 jagah jagah jaakar chhip kar tasviren lene lagate hai ki kahaan kya kaam ho rahaa he
 Where the goods are lying or where the work has stopped
 ye sari tasviren phir usee soshal media par aplod karte hai, jahaan ham maan chuke hai ki agar jaagrukta kaa khandaan kahin rahata he to wo soshal meediya he
 Facebook is the new temple for these people, whose doors come with all kinds of pictures
 shaayad isi ummid main soshal media maai ek din unke taraf dekhegi or flats dilaa degi
 Our colleague Mihir Gautam made another point
 mihir bhi flats peedit hai
 In this sequence, his experience is also constantly changing
 unhone bataaya ki 2010 tak kisi builder ke offis main aaraam se log ghus jate the or baat kar aate the
 Used to listen
 lekin pichley ek do saalon se wo bhi band ho gaya he
 In most places, the builders have deployed bouncers, due to which they can no longer meet anyone
 builder jisase chahega usee se mil saktaa he
 The comments 12 march 2015 kii times of india main saurabh sinha kii ek report mili
 According to this, the essence of this world is that if you have dreamed of buying a flat, then you will not be able to see any other dream
 saurabh kii report ke anusaar, riyality analist prope equity ke mutabik ghaziabad or noida main flats milane main ausat deree 29-30 maheene kii he
 That is, we have to face a minimum delay of two years
 gudgaanv main yah deree 34 maheene kii he or faridabad main 44 maheene kii
 Saurabh has written that as of 2015 Noida Extension, Noida Yamuna Expressway and Greater Noida 3
 6 lakh flats die jane the
 Of these, 3 lakh 20 thousand units flats i
e
 88
 7 fisadi deree se chal rahe hai
 Three lakh units were launched between 2006 and 11, some of them not built, some not started and some are being built
 report pichley saal kii he, magar halaat main buhat badlaav nahin hua he
 Our colleague Ravish Ranjan Shukla went to Faridabad
 vahaan flats ke karidaar atmaaon se mulaakaat kii he
 Nobody is listening to them
 aap darshakon se guzarish he ki aap dekh sun lenge to inkaa media par bharosa bana rahegaa ki samasya dikhaane se samaadhaan ho jayega
 i remain a bit apprehensive about this type of trust towards the media, but should think positively
 kya pataa aapke dekhne yaa jaagruk hone se halaat badal jaae
 In 2010, Satyabrata Mitra booked a house in Earth Earth's Project Earth Town in Greater Noida West
 satyabrat kaa daawa he ki builder ne broshar main daawa kiya tha ki 15 agast 2012 tak flats mil jayega
 2016 has arrived, but the flat has not been found
 is flats ko hasil karne kii ladaai ne satyabrat kii zindagi badal di he
 Satyabrata Mitra's battle started when he did not get the agreement from the builder even after giving 10 percent money
 unhenko harkar 40 pratishat paise dene pade, tab jaakar may 2011 man agreement kii copy mili
 When i saw the copy of the agreement, i was surprised to see many changes
 broshar or agreement ke bich kaaphi antar aa chukaa tha
 The builder increased the super area to 100 square feet, due to which he had to pay Rs 2 lakh more
 yahi nahin 2012 main ghar dene kii taarikh bhi badal gai
 It was written in the agreement that after 36 months of the agreement, the house will be found
 yani 2012 kii jagah 2014 main milegaa
 But in the meantime, the farmers reached the court for their compensation and the work stopped
 yahi nahin builder ne pehle vaada kiya tha ki ground floor ke alaava 14 manzil imaarat banegi, 29 tower banenge, lekin agreement main likhaa tha ki ground floor plus 19 manzil kaa tower banegaa
 Satyabrata and with him kept on writing letters with all kinds of authority but to no avail
 phir elahabaad hai court gaye
 Date is being received from there, hearing is going on but flat has not been found
 iske baad kuch kharidaaron ne milakar rit yachika daayar kar di
 The writ stated that buyers should be compensated
 court ne greater noida athurity ko aadesh diya ki karidaaron or bilderon ko bulaakar samaadhaan nikaale
 It has been a month for this order, the builder and buyer have not met yet
 in logon ne upi ke mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ke saamne bhi baat rakhi he
 An FIR has also been filed against the builder's director
 ek-ek baat isliye gina rahaa hum, taaki aap yah samaj saken ki flats nahin milane par aapse se kai log kis tarah pareshaan hote hai, to kahaan kahaan jate hai, kis kis se milte hai, magar hota kuch nahin he
 Finally let's understand that let's go to the media
 vahaan bhi jate hai, khabaren chalati hai, magar hota kuch nahin hai
 Leaders feel that there are all the issues to make you emotional, then all these problems should be left to fight alone
 vaise aapkaa bhavuk muddon se kaam chal bhi jaataa he
 For the last four to five years, ten to fifty, fifty to hundred buyers have been performing together in different cities across the country
 un pradarshnon ko fasebuk par aplod karte hai
 Put on Twitter, so that the patriotic people present there will create a ruckus on this injustice done to the rest of the patriots, but nothing happens
 zaruri he ki aap aam logon ke banaae in sanghathanon ke naam se bhi rubaru ho len

 tippaniyan a report by Saurabh Sinha was found in Times of India dated 12 March 2015
 iske anusaar is sansar kaa saar yahi he ki agar aapane flats kareedne kaa sapana dekha he, to aap phir koi doosraa sapana dekhne laayak nahin rahenge
 According to Saurabh's report, according to reality analyst Prop Equity, the average delay in getting flats in Ghaziabad and Noida is 29-30 months
 yani nunatam do saal kii deree to jhelni hi padegi
 This delay is 34 months in Gurgaon and 44 months in Faridabad
 saurabh ne likhaa he ki 2015 tak noida ekstansion,noida yamuna express ve or greater noida 3
 6 lakh flats were to be given
 inamen se 3 lakh 20 hazaar unit flats yani 88
 7 per cent are running late
 saal 2006 se 11 ke bich teen lakh unit launch kiye gaye the, unamem se kuch bane nahin, kuch shuru nahin hue or kuch ban hi rahe hai
 The report is from last year, but the situation has not changed very much
 hamaare sahyogi raveesh ranjan shukla faridabad gaye
 The buyers of the flat have met the spirits there
 inaki koi sun nahin rahaa
 You are requested by the audience that if you see and hear them, they will have confidence in the media that a problem will be solved by showing them
 media ke prati is tip ke bharose ko lekar main thodaa ashankit rahata hum, lekin positive sochna chahie
 Does your address change the situation by being aware or aware
 10 pratishat paisa dene ke baad bhi builder se agreement nahin mila to satyabrat mitra kii ladaai shuru ho gai
 He had to give 40 percent money after losing, then he got a copy of the agreement in May 2011
 agreement kii copy dekhi to kai badlaavon ko dekh hairaan rah gaye
 There was a lot of difference between the brochure and the agreement
 builder ne 100 varg foot kaa super aria badha diya, jiske kaaran unako 2 lakh rupee or dene pade
 Not only this, the date of giving home in 2012 also changed
 agreement main likhaa hua tha ki agreement banane ke 36 maheene ke baad ghar milegaa
 That is, you will get 2014 instead of 2012
 lekin is bich kisaan apane muaavze ko lekar court pahunch gaye or kaam band ho gaya
 Not only this, the builder had earlier promised that in addition to the ground floor, 14 floors would be built, 29 towers would be built, but in the agreement it was written that the ground floor plus 19 floor towers would be built
 satyabrat or unke saath tamaam tarah kii athurity se chitthee patari karte rah gaye magar koi laabh nahin hua
 Then went to Allahabad High Court
 vahaan se tarikh hi mil rahi he, sunwaayee hi ho rahi he magar flats nahin mila he
 After this, some buyers filed a writ petition together
 rit main kaha ki karidaaron ko muawza milanaa chahie
 The court ordered the Greater Noida Authority to call buyers and builders to find a solution
 ek maheenaa ho gaya he is aadesh kaa, abhi tak builder or karidaar kii baithak nahin hui he
 These people have also spoken in front of UP Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav
 builder ke diarector ke khilaaf exiaar bhi darj ho chuki he
 i am counting every single thing, so that you can understand how many people are upset with you if you do not get a flat, then where do they go, whom do they meet, but nothing happens
 ant main yah samajhate hai ki chalo media ke paas
 Go there too, the news goes on, but nothing happens
 netaaon ko lagata he ki aapako bhavuk karne ke liye tamaam mudde hai hi to in sab samasyaon ko akele kii ladaai ke liye chhod diya jaae
 By the way, your emotional issues also work
 pichley chaar paanch saal se desh bhar ke alag alag shaharon main das se pachaas, pachaas se sau karidaar milakar pradarshan kar rahe hai
 Upload those performances to Facebook
 twitor par daalate hai, taaki vahaan maujuud jaagruk deshbhakt log baaki deshbhakton ke saath ho rahi is ninsaphi par hangaamaa machaa denge, magar hota kuch nahin he
 It is important that you get familiar with the names of these organizations made by the common people
 FEDRATIONS OF APARTMENT OWNERS ASSOCIATION ke tahat 88 houseing sosayadi ke log jude hue hai
 The page of NEFOWA- NEW ERA FLAT OWENRS WELFARE ASSOCIATION shows that there are 9672 members
 NEFOMA- NOIDA ESTATE FLAT OWNER MAIN ASSOCIATION ke fasebuk par 10,206 sadsy hai
 KOLKATA WEST INTERNATIONAL CITY BUYERS WELFARE ASSOCIATION has 4087 likes on its page
 TRIVENI FARIDABAD ALLOTTIES ASSOCIATION ke 2700 sadsy hai, jinamein se 300 biguef ke jawan hai
 In addition, there are many organizations like AMRAPALI VERONA HEIGHTS FLAT BUYERS ASSOCIATION, EARTH TOWN BUYERS, PARAMOUNT APARTMENT OWNER ASSOCIATIONS
 maine naam isliye bataaye, taaki aapako pataa chal sake ki tamaam sanghathanon ke is desh main bilderon se pareshaan logon ne kitne tarah ke sanghathan bana liye hai
 They are fighting a long battle at their own level
 kabhi dilli aakar rahul gandhi se milte hai, to lakhanu jaakar akhilesh yadav se milte hai
 Union minister also weeps in front of Venkaiah Naidu
 magar kuch nahin hota he
 Not only this, from mlas to mps, the door is knocked
 har jagah se haar kar builder ke darvaaze par tarah tarah ke pradarshan bhi karte hai
 You can also see the picture of a different type of civil movement being created due to their problems so that you can get an idea and you can be alert that you will not have to perform in this way
 hamane kuch tasviren inke fasebuk pej se lee hai
 These people even took off their clothes so that everyone could be noticed
 is tasviir main log munh par pattee baandhe hue hai
 You can see a long rally in this picture
 yahaan to log sadak par hi baith gaye hai
 Somewhere Anna's hat starts to appear, as if seeing this hat, the builder fears a future Kejriwal and gives it a flat, then some one has become Gandhi
 gandhi par yah bharosa laajawab he
 One must research how many demonstrations in India are called for in a year
 gandhi kii aatma kya vaaki logon ko pareshaan karne vaale paramatmaon ko kuch badal paati hogi
 New new types of slogans are coming out
 amrapali itani der lagaae ki dada makaan book karaaye or pota posation paae
 a slogan is bread cloth and lies
 
 
 sthaneey se lekar dilli sthit rashtriya media main in sab pradarshnon kii pej number ek se lekar das ke bheetar tasviren chap jaati hai
 These people make clippings and move around
 ham sabakaa dhyaan do chaar raajnneetik dalon ke pravaktaaon par hi rahata he, lekin kisi samajashastri ko jaakar dekhnaa chahie ki flats kii pareshaani ne kis tarah se middle class ko sakriy kar diya he
 He is colliding with all kinds of institutions
 hataash ho rahaa he or is prakriya main khud bhi badal rahaa he
 Our colleague Mihir removed some more pictures from Facebook that need your attention
 bilderon se pareshaan karidaar site kaa daura karte rahete hai
 Keep looking at your dreams when it will be achieved
 kab banegaa
 In this affair, they also act as cids
 jagah jagah jaakar chhip kar tasviren lene lagate hai ki kahaan kya kaam ho rahaa he
 Where the goods are lying or where the work has stopped
 ye sari tasviren phir usee soshal media par aplod karte hai, jahaan ham maan chuke hai ki agar jaagrukta kaa khandaan kahin rahata he to wo soshal meediya he
 Facebook is the new temple for these people, whose doors come with all kinds of pictures
 shaayad isi ummid main soshal media maai ek din unke taraf dekhegi or flats dilaa degi
 Our colleague Mihir Gautam made another point
 mihir bhi flats peedit hai
 In this sequence, his experience is also constantly changing
 unhone bataaya ki 2010 tak kisi builder ke offis main aaraam se log ghus jate the or baat kar aate the
 Used to listen
 lekin pichley ek do saalon se wo bhi band ho gaya he
 In most places, the builders have deployed bouncers, due to which they can no longer meet anyone
 builder jisase chahega usee se mil saktaa he
 The comments 12 march 2015 kii times of india main saurabh sinha kii ek report mili
 According to this, the essence of this world is that if you have dreamed of buying a flat, then you will not be able to see any other dream
 saurabh kii report ke anusaar, riyality analist prope equity ke mutabik ghaziabad or noida main flats milane main ausat deree 29-30 maheene kii he
 That is, we have to face a minimum delay of two years
 gudgaanv main yah deree 34 maheene kii he or faridabad main 44 maheene kii
 Saurabh has written that as of 2015 Noida Extension, Noida Yamuna Expressway and Greater Noida 3
 6 lakh flats die jane the
 Of these, 3 lakh 20 thousand units flats i
e
 88
 7 fisadi deree se chal rahe hai
 Three lakh units were launched between 2006 and 11, some of them not built, some not started and some are being built
 report pichley saal kii he, magar halaat main buhat badlaav nahin hua he
 Our colleague Ravish Ranjan Shukla went to Faridabad
 vahaan flats ke karidaar atmaaon se mulaakaat kii he
 Nobody is listening to them
 aap darshakon se guzarish he ki aap dekh sun lenge to inkaa media par bharosa bana rahegaa ki samasya dikhaane se samaadhaan ho jayega
 i remain a bit apprehensive about this type of trust towards the media, but should think positively
 kya pataa aapke dekhne yaa jaagruk hone se halaat badal jaae
 But in the meantime, the farmers reached the court for their compensation and the work stopped
 yahi nahin builder ne pehle vaada kiya tha ki ground floor ke alaava 14 manzil imaarat banegi, 29 tower banenge, lekin agreement main likhaa tha ki ground floor plus 19 manzil kaa tower banegaa

 vaastu shaastra kii maane to ek paudha aisa bhi hota he jo na sirf aapke ghar kii sudanrata badhaata he balki aapaki aarthik sthit main bhi sudhaar laa saktaa he
 Yes and the name of this plant is 'money Plant'
 is paudhe ke bare main aksar kaha jaataa he ki is paudhe ko kabhi bhi kharidkar ghar main nahin lagaana chahie
 Let us know how, with some measures, you can brighten your rough luck with the help of this plant
 -pehla upaay, mani plant ko hameshaa south east jone main rakhana chahie
 According to Hinduism, South East Zone belongs to Lord Ganpati
 mani plant kaa paudha paise, achche bhagya kaa pratik mana jaataa he
 Putting it in this corner of the house opens up one's luck
 -mani plant ke paudhe ko buudhvaar ke din revati nakshatra ke din ghar main laaen
 This is because this day is also considered to be Ganpati who gives auspicious results to the person
 -bhuulakar bhi mani plant ke paudhe ko north east jone main na rakhen
 Doing so will negatively affect your health and household members may become ill
 -partner ke saath agar rishte main khatas aa gai he to sabase pehle apane ghar ke west yaa east jone se mani plant hataa den
 The money plant in this corner of the house brings you mental trouble and brings a sourness to the relationship
 aise main ghar ke logon ke saath rishte main madhurata laane ke liye aapako dil shape kii pattiyon vaale mani plant ko ghaki main lagaana chahie
 To overcome the shortage of money, you should plant a money plant with a note-shaped in the South East direction
 iske alaava kabhi bhi ravivaar ko is paudhe main jal nahin dena chahie or jal dete samay hameshaa pani main ek chammach doodh mila den
 By doing this, there will be a shortage of money along with happiness in the house
 -yadi ghaki main laga mani plant jameen kii taraf fail rahaa he to aisa na hone den
 This means your money is being spent on wasteful things
 dhan ko sanchit karne or ghar main sukh shanti laane ke liye mani plant ko kisi rassi yaa danda kii madad se upar kii taraf baandh len
 By doing this, your fame and money will also increase

 Input: IANS raajnneetik dalon or netaaon ke liye raahat kii khabar yah he ki chunaav ayog chunaav par hone vaale kharch kii seemaa ko badhaane ja rahaa he
 a decision on this can be taken early next month
 angreji akhbaar 'da indian express' ne yah khabar di he
 According to the report, the government had made such a request
 kaaphi vichaar-vimarsh ke baad chunaav ayog iske liye taiyaar ho gaya he
 Politicians and parties had long demanded that the commission increase the spending limit
 ab loksabhaa chunaav ke purv chunavi kharch main 30 se 50 pratishat tak kii badhotaree ho sakati he
 a decision in this regard can be taken in the Election Commission meeting next month
 report main bataaya gaya he ki loksabhaa chunaav main kharch kii seemaa maujuuda 40 lakh rupee or vidhansabha chunaav main 16 lakh rupee se badhaakar kaaphi aage kii ja sakati he
 In Lok Sabha elections, the spending limit is fixed according to the size of the constituency
 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav main ummidavaaron ko chunaav-prachaar par 25 lakh rupee tak kharch karne kii ijaajat thi
 In large assembly constituencies this amount was up to Rs 10 lakh
 ek sarkari adhikari ne bataaya ki is baar badhotaree 30 se 50 pratishat tak hogi
 After getting this approval from the Election Commission, the government will proclaim it under Section 90 of the Election Act
 2011 main chunaav ayog ne sansadeey kshetron ke liye kharch kii seemaa badhaakar 40 lakh rupee kii thi
 Candidates spending more than this can also be disqualified
 lekin yah bhi aarope lagata rahaa ki ummidavaar kharch kam karke dikhaate hai or jhuthe certificate dete hai
 Actually, it is not possible to contest elections in such a small amount

 kumaar kunal, dilli ajtak The political future of his son Chaudhary Ajit Singh and grandson Jayant Chaudhary, who holds the political legacy of former Prime Minister Chaudhary Charan Singh, is also at stake, with the country's condition set for the Lok Sabha elections 2019
 yahi vajah he ki 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main jiro par out hone vaali ajit singh kii party areldi is baar sapa-basapa ke saath milakar chunavi samar main utari he
 Bagpat and Muzaffarnagar, the Lok Sabha seats considered to be the political stronghold of western Uttar Pradesh and Jatland, are eyeing the entire country this time
 is baar choudhary ajit singh mujffarnagar se to jayant choudhary bagpat seat se maidan main utre hai
 Votes will be cast in both these seats in the first phase itself
 iskaa matlab saaf he ki chunaav ke pehle hi daur ke voting se areldi ke raajnneetik bhavishya kaa faisla ho jayega
 Jayant Chaudhary Baghpat seat, which came to save heritage in Baghpat, is also known as the karmabhoomi of former Prime Minister Chaudhary Charan Singh and his son Ajit Singh
 lekin 2014 main modi lahar ke dam par bijepi ne yahaan paracham laharaaya or mumbai police ke kamishnar rah chuke satyapal singh saansad chune gaye
 Chaudhary Ajit Singh was third
 is baar bagpat ke siyaasi ran se choudhary ajit singh kii bajaay jayant choudhary utre hai or unka muqabla bijepi ke maujuuda saansad satyapal singh se he
 Baghpat is considered very important both in terms of farming and industry
 2019 kaa loksabhaa chunaav areldi ke liye astitv kii ladaai maani ja rahi he
 In terms of alliance, the BJP is facing a tough challenge this time
 vahiin, jayant choudhary apane paariwarik garh ko bachaane ke liye jaddojahad kar rahe hai
 However, through the SP-BSP-RLD alliance, in front of Jayant Chaudhary, Dalit, Muslim and Jat voters are dreaming of victory
 vahiin, bijepi ummidavaar satyapal singh, jat, gurjar, rajput, kashyap maton ke jariye dobaaraa se sansad pahunchane kii jugat main hai
 Both Jayant Chaudhary and Satyapal Singh leaders come from the Jat community
 aise main jat samudaay ko lekar donon dalon kii baraabar kii daavedaari he
 Choudhary Chaudhary from Muzaffarnagar RLD chief Chaudhary Ajit Singh is contesting from Muzaffarnagar from his traditional seat
 ajit singh haal ke dinon main kah chuke hai ki yah unka antim chunaav hoga
 The 2013 communal riots in Muzaffarnagar led to polarization of Muslim and Jat votes, which the BJP benefited from and Sanjeev Balyan was elected from here
 is baar bijepi ne ek baar phir sanjeev baalion ko utaara he
 This is how the Jat vs Jat battle is taking place
 2013 ke sampradayik dange se pashchim upi main jat or musalamaanon ke bich khain gahari ho gai thi
 Ajit Singh's decision to contest from this seat is also seen to be linked to the party's far-reaching strategy
 areldi ke rashtriya mahasachiv dow
 Merajuddin said that Chaudhary Ajit Singh wants to re-unite Jat and Muslim from Muzaffarnagar
 darasal areldi lambey samay tak jat or muslim voton ke sameekaran ke jariye chunavi jang jitati rahi he
 That is why RLD is trying to get its lost support base with SP-BSP
 pichley loksabhaa or 2017 vidhansabha chunaavon main areldi ko baari nuksaan uthaanaa padaa tha
 Though Chaudhary Ajit Singh is successful in uniting Dalits, Muslims and Jats in Muzaffarnagar, repeat victory for the BJP will be a crook
 mujffarnagar ke jaateey sameekaran ko dekhen to sabase zyada saadhe paanch lakh muslim matadaata hai
 After this there are only three lakh Jat and three lakh Dalit voters
 iske alaava ek lakh saini, ek lakh rajput or dhed lakh kashyap vot he
 If you combine Dalits, Muslims and Jats, it is close to 70 per cent, but like Chaudhary Ajit Singh, Sanjeev Balyan of BJP also comes from Jat community
 is tarah jat matadaataaon ko donon netaa saadhane main jute hai
 Whereas, BJP is trying to bring non-yadav OBC votes in its favor along with Jats
 jairam kehete hai ki raghuram se dhyaan hataane ke liye centre sarkaar ne videshi nivesh ke faislon kaa elaan kiya he
 The same criticism has come from India's small but largest opposition party and Jairam Ramesh has said that there will be a detailed response on Monday
 jab bharat kaa mukhya vipakshi dal faisle ke din aalochana pesh nahin kar saktaa to yah bataaiye ki duniya kii chauthi badi arthvyavastha kii sarkaar ek saath kai sectoron main videshi nivesh ke faisle le to kya aath ghante ke bheetar news ankar un faislon kii paryaapt samiksha pesh kar saktaa he
 The Opposition could have asked this day if there is any sector left which is not open for foreign investment
 press information beuro ne angrezi main jari press reelij main kaha gaya he ki centre sarkaar ne pratyaksh videshi nivesh ko puri tarah se udaar bana diya he taaki bharat main rojgaar paidaa ho sake
 It has been said by the government that with these changes, India has become the most open economy in the world
 isi ke saath raksha kshetra main 100% pratyaksh videshi nivesh kii ijazat hogi, abhi tak 49% pratyaksh videshi nivesh kii sidhi ijazat thi
 Above that, government permission was required for FDI up to 100% and only in case of advanced technology could such investment be allowed
 ab unnat takanic yani State of Art shabd ko hataa diya gaya he or uski jagah Modern yani aadhunik yaa Other reasons shabdon ko jod diya gaya he
 What is the difference between advanced technology and modern technology
 kya aadhunik takanic unnt nahin hoti, yaa unnat takanic aadhunik nahin hoti
 Former Defense Minister AK Antony has termed these decisions a threat to national security
 vaise unke samay bhi aise faisle hue hai
 Defense critic Ajay Shukla, while reacting promptly, wrote that 100% investment in defense is a game of words
 upie ke samay se hi state of art tech ke aadhaar par anumati di gai thi
 Now it has been allowed from the root of modern technology
 ajay shukla kaa kahana he ki raksha mantralay ke paas aadhunik yaa state of di art technology kii koi paribhaasha nahin he
 So what needs to be introduced in this inter-defense sector as a foreign investment reform
 ajay shukla ne 9 june 2014 ko bijness standard akhbaar main likhaa tha ki 2006 se hi alag alag maamalon main raksha kshetra main 100 pratishat videshi nivesh kii anumati he
 He had then said that all this was being done for original equipment manufacturers since 2006 but not a single project came up
 maine ek vaikalpik raay bataa di lekin zaruri he ki har sector par thos jaankaree ke baad hi raay banaai jaae
 However, today the central government has decided to increase the amount of foreign investment in 9 sectors
 pradhanmantri ne ise november 2015 ke baad doosraa bada sudhaar kaha he
 However, with the permission of the government, 100 percent foreign investment will be made in the manufacture of food and beverage
 bharat main utpaadit or nirmit khaadya samagriyon ke i-kamrs main bhi 100 fisadi kii anumati di gai he
 100% foreign investment in the field of broadcasting such as DTH, cable network, mobile TV has been exempted from government processes
 centre sarkaar kaa kahana he ki 2015 ke vittiya varsh main 55 arab dollar se adhik kaa videshi nivesh hua he
 This is a record in any one financial year
 bharat sarkaar ne kaha he ki rojgaar badhaane ke liye somvaar ko itnaa bada faisla liya gaya
 We are not in a position to tell how much employment has been or is going to be created from the record foreign investment that has come from 2014 to 2016
 first post website par sindhu bhattacharya ne 15 april 2016 ko lekh likhaa ki modi sarkaar ke do varshon main aath sectoron main rojgaar kii raftaar dhimi hui he
 This information is based on the report of the Labor Bureau, Government of India
 kapadaa udyog, chamada udyog, dhaatu udyog, automobil, ratna or jawaharaat, parivahan or iti or bipio, handloom powerloom in aath sectoron main mazaduron kii kaaphi zarurat padati he
 And in these eight sectors only about five lakh jobs could be created in two years
 2009 kii tulana main ye 10 guna kam he
 It is a different question, whether it is reduced or increased, but there is no concrete and authentic data of employment generation which can present the picture of all sectors
 philhal sarkaar kah rahi he ki nae faisle se rojgaar kaa srijan hoga
 Now let's move to the next sector
 dawa companiyon ke kshetra main greenfield pharma brown field pharma main 100 fisadi nivesh kar diya gaya he
 Greenfield Pharma means when a new company is born with foreign investment
 lekin jab pehle se maujuud kisi company main nivesh kiya jaae to use brown field pharma kehete hai
 Investing in Brown Field Pharma will make the acquisition and merger process easier
 greenfield or brown field main 74 fisadi videshi nivesh hi automatic root se hoga
 Further government permission will be required
 10 june ko kai akhabaaron main khabar chhapi thi ki sarkaar dawa companiyon main videshi nivesh ke prastaav par vichaar kar rahi he
 Concern has been expressed in this case that the generic pharmaceutical industry will be threatened if foreign companies take over or merge with Indian companies
 jenrik yani bina brands kii dawaaen mahangi ho jaati hai
 On this decision, Kiran Mazumdar Shaw of pharma company Biocon Limited tweeted that it is a welcome step to bring foreign investment in the pharma sector under the automatic approval route
 ise bahut pehle hi kar diya janaa chahie tha kyonki is sector ko bahut puunji kii zarurat hoti he
 The central government has recently announced a new aviation policy
 is sector main bhi videshi nivesh ko saral bana diya gaya he
 Under this, 100% foreign investment in the new project will be made through the automatic route to build the airport
 puraane project main 74 fisadi se zyaada nivesh karne par sarkaar kii anumati leni hogi
 To modernize the airports which are running now and to ease the pressure of passengers, 100% foreigners will be able to
 brownfield airport project yani jahaan pehle se kaam chal rahaa ho vahaan sarkaar se anumati kii koi zarurat nahin he
 In the private security agency sector, 49 to 74 percent investment can be done with the permission of the government
 privet security guard kii dastaan yahaan sunaauungaa to aap ro denge
 Their salaries, poor work facilities
 ye sab kya thik ho paaegaa
 Can the government do anything to improve their conditions and conditions of service? aglaa sector he pashupaalan, jalakheti, machhlipaalan, madhumakhipaalan main 100 fisadi videshi kii anumati di gai he
 Earlier investment could be done through automatic route with some conditions
 sarkaar ne un kuch sharton ko hataa diya he
 Fish farming is fine, but a question arises from natural intelligence that we also need foreign investment in bee keeping
 gramodyog bhi nahin bachaa to kya bachaa
 But you will try to know whether foreign investment in this field opens up huge possibilities
 ab aate hai naunve number ke sector par
 Single Brand Retail
 isamen bhi atyaadhunik takniki ke bahaane riyaayaton kaa dayera bada kar diya gaya he
 The condition of the purchase at the local company has been extended to three years
 upie ke samay se hi single brands retail main kuch sharton ke saath sau fisadi videshi nivesh kar diya gaya tha
 In the year 2012-13, there was a lot of opposition to foreign investment in this sector
 tab bataaya jaataa tha ki videshi retail companiyaan aaengi to desi khudara vyapaaree barbaad ho jaaenge
 It was argued that the BJP is protesting that the business community has been its traditional vote bank
 jaise vyapaaree varg single brands retail main he hi nahin
 If you match the old political statements on the issue of foreign investment with these decisions, then the pattern of misdeeds will be seen
 tippaniyan The BJP then opposed foreign investment
 bijepi yah bhi kahati thi ki congress bhi to virodh karti thi
 When the UPA opened the doors to foreign investment, the media looked to the BJP for criticism
 bijepi niraash bhi nahin karti thi
 When the NDA government comes, during such decisions, the media does not look towards the Congress, but towards the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh and Swadeshi Jagran Manch associated with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh
 ye donon sanghathan niraash nahin karte
 When the central government announced its reforms regarding foreign investment in defense, insurance and railways, the Swadeshi Jagran Manch was also strongly opposed
 ab lagata he ki modi sarkaar aarthik maamalon main sangh ke dabaav se bhi aage ja chuki he
 An interesting twist in the response of Swadeshi Jagran Manch is that Dhanraj Bhide of Swadeshi Jagran Manch has welcomed foreign investment in defense sector but got angry about investment in animal husbandry sector and called it anti national decision but called treason 
 2013 se telecom sector main sau fisadi nivesh kii anumati he
 The condition of this sector is not very good
 pichley saal iskaa rajasav growth 6
 5 percent which is the lowest since 2010
 30 may 2016 ko times of india main ye chapa he
 Earlier this sector used to have double-digit revenue growth
 kya ham jaanate hai ki sau fisadi nivesh kii anumati jin sectoron main hai vahaan kis str kii pragati hui he
 There is such a huge lack of data that all the debate ends in the book itself according to the assumptions
 unnat takanic or aadhunik takanic main kya antar hota he
 Is modern technology not advanced, or is advanced technology not modern? purv raksha mantri eke antni ne in faislon ko rashtriya suraksha ke liye khatra bataaya he
 By the way, such decisions have also been made during his time
 raksha sameekshak ajay shukla ne twarit pratikriya pesh karte hue likhaa he ki raksha main sau fisadi kaa nivesh shabdon kaa khel he
 Permission was given on the basis of State of Art Tech since the time of UPA
 ab jaakar ise aadhunik technology ke root se anumati di gai he
 Ajay Shukla says that the Ministry of Defense has no definition of modern or state of the art technology
 lihaaza is antar raksha kshetra main videshi nivesh sudhaar ke taur par pesh karne kii zarurat hi kya he
 Ajay Shukla wrote in Business Standard newspaper on June 9, 2014 that since 2006, 100 percent foreign investment in the defense sector has been allowed in different cases
 tab unhone kaha tha ki moulik upkaran nirmaataaon ke liye yah sab 2006 se kiya ja rahaa he lekin ek bhi project nahin aayaa
 i have given an alternative opinion but it is important that opinion should be formed only after concrete information on every sector
 baharhaal centre sarkaar ne aaj 9 kshetron main videshi nivesh kii maatra badhaane kaa faisla kiya he
 The Prime Minister has called it the second major reform after November 2015
 baharhaal khaane pine kii saamagree ke nirmaan main sarkaar kii anumati se 100 fisadi kaa videshi nivesh hone lagegaa
 100 per cent has also been allowed in e-commerce of food produced and manufactured in India
 broadcasting jaise dit, cabel network, mobile tivi ke kshetra main 100 fisadi videshi nivesh ko sarkari prakriyaaon se mukt kar diya gaya he
 The central government says that in the 2015 fiscal year, foreign investment has been more than $ 55 billion
 yah kisi bhi ek vittiya varsh main record he
 The Government of India has said that such a big decision was taken on Monday to increase employment
 ham yah bataane kii sthiti main nahin hai ki 2014 se 2016 tak jo record videshi nivesh aayaa he usase kitna rojgaar srijan hua he yaa hone ja rahaa he
 On the First Post website, Sindhu Bhattacharya wrote an article on 15 April 2016 that in the two years of the Modi government, employment in eight sectors has slowed down
 ye soochna bharat sarkaar ke shram beuro kii report par aadhaarit he
 The textile industry, leather industry, metal industry, automobiles, gems and gems, transport and IT and BPO, handloom powerloom, these eight sectors require a lot of workers
 or inhen aath sectoron main do saal main lagbhag paanch lakh naukariyaan hi paidaa ho sakin
 This is 10 times less than in 2009
 kam hua yaa zyada hua ye alag sawaal he lekin rojgaar srijan kaa koi thos or pramanik aankada nahin he jo sabhi sectoron kii tasviir pesh kar sake
 The government is currently saying that the new decision will create employment
 ab badhate hai agle sector kii taraf
 In the field of pharmaceutical companies, Greenfield Pharma has been 100 percent invested in Brown Field Pharma
 greenfield pharma matlab jab videshi nivesh se kisi nai company kii nai shuruuaat hoti he
 But when invested in an already existing company, it is called Brown Field Pharma
 brown field pharma main nivesh se adhigrahan or vilay kii prakriya aasaan ho jaaegi
 Only 74 per cent of foreign investment in greenfield and brown field will be through the automatic route
 uske aage sarkaar kii anumati zaruri hogi
 On June 10, several newspapers reported that the government was considering a proposal for foreign investment in pharmaceutical companies
 is maamle main chintaa vyakt kii jaati rahi he ki videshi companiyaan bhartiya companiyon kaa adhigrahan yaa vilay kar lengi to jenrik dawa udyog par khatra aa jayega
 Generics, ie unbranded medicines, become expensive
 is faisle par pharma company biokan limited kii kiran mazumdaar shaw ne twit kiya he ki pharma sector main videshi nivesh ko swat: manzuri maarg ke daayre main laana swaagat yogya kadam he
 It should have been done much earlier because this sector requires a lot of capital
 centre sarkaar ne haal hi main nai aviation niti kii ghoshnaa kii he
 Foreign investment in this sector has also been simplified
 iske tahat airport banane ke liye nae project main 100 fisadi videshi nivesh automatic root se ho sakegaa
 Government permission will have to be taken for investing more than 74% in old projects
 jo airport abhi chal rahe hai unhen aadhunik banane or yatriyon ke dabaav ko saral karne ke liye 100 fisadi videshi ho sakegaa
 There is no need for permission from the government where the brownfield airport project is already in operation
 privet security agency kshetra main bhi 49 se 74 fisadi nivesh sarkaar kii anumati se kiya ja sakegaa
 If i tell the story of the private security guard here, you will cry
 unke vetan, kaam kii kharaab suvidha
 What will be all right? kya sarkaar unki seva kii sharton or sthiti ko behatar karne ke liye bhi kuch kar sakati he
 The next sector is animal husbandry, aquaculture, fisheries, beekeeping and 100% foreigners are allowed
 pehle kuch sharton ke saath automatic root se nivesh ho saktaa tha
 The government has removed some of those conditions
 machhlee paalan to thik he lekin sahaj buddhi se ek sawaal to banataa he ki madhumakhi paalan main bhi hamen videshi nivesh kii zarurat he
 If village industry is not left, what is left? lekin yah jaanane kaa aap prayaas kijiega ki kya pataa ki is kshetra main videshi nivesh se vyapak sambhaavnaaen khul jaaen
 Now come to the ninth number sector
 single brands retail
 In this too, the scope of concessions has been enlarged due to the use of state-of-the-art technology
 sthaneey company par kharidari kii shart ko teen saal tak ke liye kar diya gaya he
 From the time of UPA, 100% foreign investment was made in single brand retail with certain conditions
 2012-13 ke saal main is sector main videshi nivesh ko lekar khub virodh hota tha
 Then it was said that if foreign retail companies come, then domestic retailers will be ruined
 daleel di jaati thi ki bijepi isliye virodh kar rahi he ki vyapaarik samudaay uskaa paaramparik vot bank rahaa he
 Just like the merchant class is not in single brand retail
 agar aap videshi nivesh ke masale par puraane raajnneetik bayanon kaa milan in faislon se karenge to kutarkon kaa pattern hi nazar aayega
 The comments tab bijepi videshi nivesh kaa virodh karti thi
 The BJP also said that the Congress was also opposed
 jab upie videshi nivesh ke darvaaze kholti thi to media aalochana ke liye bijepi kii taraf dekhtaa tha
 The BJP did not disappoint either
 endie kii sarkaar aati he to aise faislon ke vakt media congress kii taraf nahin, rashtriya swayamsevak sangh se jude bhartiya mazdoor sangh or swadeshi jaagran manch kii taraf dekhne lagata he
 These two organizations do not disappoint
 centre sarkaar ne jab raksha, beemaa or railway main videshi nivesh ko lekar apane sudhaaron kii ghoshnaa kii thi tab swadeshi jaagran manch ne khub virodh kiya bhi tha
 Now it seems that the Modi government has gone beyond the pressure of the Sangh in economic matters
 swadeshi jaagran manch kii pratikriya main ek dilachasp mode yah aayaa he ki swadeshi jaagran manch ke dhanraj bhide ne raksha kshetra main videshi nivesh kaa swaagat kiya he magar pashupaalan ke kshetra main nivesh ko lekar naaraaz ho gaye or ise rashtravirohi faisla bataa diya balki rashtradroh kah diya
 Since 2013, 100% investment in the telecom sector is allowed
 is sector kii haalat bahut acchhee to nahin he
 Its revenue growth 6 last year
 5 pratishat tha jo 2010 ke baad sabase kam he
 It appeared in the Times of India on 30 May 2016
 pehle is sector kii rajasav vruddhi do ankon main hua karti thi
 Do we know what level of progress has been made in the sectors where 100% investment is allowed
 aankadon kii itani ghor kami he ki sari bahes dharanaon ke hisaab kitaab main hi khatm ho jaati he
 Ajay Shukla wrote in Business Standard newspaper on June 9, 2014 that since 2006, 100 percent foreign investment in the defense sector has been allowed in different cases

 machhlee paalan to thik he lekin sahaj buddhi se ek sawaal to banataa he ki madhumakhi paalan main bhi hamen videshi nivesh kii zarurat he
 If village industry is not left, what is left? lekin yah jaanane kaa aap prayaas kijiega ki kya pataa ki is kshetra main videshi nivesh se vyapak sambhaavnaaen khul jaaen
 Now come to the ninth number sector
 single brands retail
 In this too, the scope of concessions has been enlarged due to the use of state-of-the-art technology
 sthaneey company par kharidari kii shart ko teen saal tak ke liye kar diya gaya he
 From the time of UPA, 100% foreign investment was made in single brand retail with certain conditions
 2012-13 ke saal main is sector main videshi nivesh ko lekar khub virodh hota tha
 Then it was said that if foreign retail companies come, then domestic retailers will be ruined
 daleel di jaati thi ki bijepi isliye virodh kar rahi he ki vyapaarik samudaay uskaa paaramparik vot bank rahaa he
 Just like the merchant class is not in single brand retail
 agar aap videshi nivesh ke masale par puraane raajnneetik bayanon kaa milan in faislon se karenge to kutarkon kaa pattern hi nazar aayega
 The comments tab bijepi videshi nivesh kaa virodh karti thi
 The BJP also said that the Congress was also opposed
 jab upie videshi nivesh ke darvaaze kholti thi to media aalochana ke liye bijepi kii taraf dekhtaa tha
 The BJP did not disappoint either
 endie kii sarkaar aati he to aise faislon ke vakt media congress kii taraf nahin, rashtriya swayamsevak sangh se jude bhartiya mazdoor sangh or swadeshi jaagran manch kii taraf dekhne lagata he
 These two organizations do not disappoint
 centre sarkaar ne jab raksha, beemaa or railway main videshi nivesh ko lekar apane sudhaaron kii ghoshnaa kii thi tab swadeshi jaagran manch ne khub virodh kiya bhi tha
 Now it seems that the Modi government has gone beyond the pressure of the Sangh in economic matters
 swadeshi jaagran manch kii pratikriya main ek dilachasp mode yah aayaa he ki swadeshi jaagran manch ke dhanraj bhide ne raksha kshetra main videshi nivesh kaa swaagat kiya he magar pashupaalan ke kshetra main nivesh ko lekar naaraaz ho gaye or ise rashtravirohi faisla bataa diya balki rashtradroh kah diya
 Since 2013, 100% investment in the telecom sector is allowed
 is sector kii haalat bahut acchhee to nahin he
 Its revenue growth 6 last year
 5 pratishat tha jo 2010 ke baad sabase kam he
 It appeared in the Times of India on 30 May 2016
 pehle is sector kii rajasav vruddhi do ankon main hua karti thi
 Do we know what level of progress has been made in the sectors where 100% investment is allowed
 aankadon kii itani ghor kami he ki sari bahes dharanaon ke hisaab kitaab main hi khatm ho jaati he
 The textile industry, leather industry, metal industry, automobiles, gems and gems, transport and IT and BPO, handloom powerloom, these eight sectors require a lot of workers
 or inhen aath sectoron main do saal main lagbhag paanch lakh naukariyaan hi paidaa ho sakin
 This is 10 times less than in 2009
 kam hua yaa zyada hua ye alag sawaal he lekin rojgaar srijan kaa koi thos or pramanik aankada nahin he jo sabhi sectoron kii tasviir pesh kar sake
 The government is currently saying that the new decision will create employment
 ab badhate hai agle sector kii taraf
 In the field of pharmaceutical companies, Greenfield Pharma has been 100 percent invested in Brown Field Pharma
 greenfield pharma matlab jab videshi nivesh se kisi nai company kii nai shuruuaat hoti he
 But when invested in an already existing company, it is called Brown Field Pharma
 brown field pharma main nivesh se adhigrahan or vilay kii prakriya aasaan ho jaaegi
 Only 74 per cent of foreign investment in greenfield and brown field will be through the automatic route
 uske aage sarkaar kii anumati zaruri hogi
 On June 10, several newspapers reported that the government was considering a proposal for foreign investment in pharmaceutical companies
 is maamle main chintaa vyakt kii jaati rahi he ki videshi companiyaan bhartiya companiyon kaa adhigrahan yaa vilay kar lengi to jenrik dawa udyog par khatra aa jayega
 Generics, ie unbranded medicines, become expensive
 is faisle par pharma company biokan limited kii kiran mazumdaar shaw ne twit kiya he ki pharma sector main videshi nivesh ko swat: manzuri maarg ke daayre main laana swaagat yogya kadam he
 It should have been done much earlier because this sector requires a lot of capital
 centre sarkaar ne haal hi main nai aviation niti kii ghoshnaa kii he
 Foreign investment in this sector has also been simplified
 iske tahat airport banane ke liye nae project main 100 fisadi videshi nivesh automatic root se ho sakegaa
 Government permission will have to be taken for investing more than 74% in old projects
 jo airport abhi chal rahe hai unhen aadhunik banane or yatriyon ke dabaav ko saral karne ke liye 100 fisadi videshi ho sakegaa
 There is no need for permission from the government where the brownfield airport project is already in operation
 privet security agency kshetra main bhi 49 se 74 fisadi nivesh sarkaar kii anumati se kiya ja sakegaa
 If i tell the story of the private security guard here, you will cry
 unke vetan, kaam kii kharaab suvidha
 What will be all right? kya sarkaar unki seva kii sharton or sthiti ko behatar karne ke liye bhi kuch kar sakati he
 The next sector is animal husbandry, aquaculture, fisheries, beekeeping and 100% foreigners are allowed
 pehle kuch sharton ke saath automatic root se nivesh ho saktaa tha
 The government has removed some of those conditions
 machhlee paalan to thik he lekin sahaj buddhi se ek sawaal to banataa he ki madhumakhi paalan main bhi hamen videshi nivesh kii zarurat he
 If village industry is not left, what is left? lekin yah jaanane kaa aap prayaas kijiega ki kya pataa ki is kshetra main videshi nivesh se vyapak sambhaavnaaen khul jaaen
 Now come to the ninth number sector
 single brands retail
 In this too, the scope of concessions has been enlarged due to the use of state-of-the-art technology
 sthaneey company par kharidari kii shart ko teen saal tak ke liye kar diya gaya he
 From the time of UPA, 100% foreign investment was made in single brand retail with certain conditions

 Then it was said that if foreign retail companies come, then domestic retailers will be ruined
 daleel di jaati thi ki bijepi isliye virodh kar rahi he ki vyapaarik samudaay uskaa paaramparik vot bank rahaa he
 Just like the merchant class is not in single brand retail
 agar aap videshi nivesh ke masale par puraane raajnneetik bayanon kaa milan in faislon se karenge to kutarkon kaa pattern hi nazar aayega
 The comments tab bijepi videshi nivesh kaa virodh karti thi
 The BJP also said that the Congress was also opposed
 jab upie videshi nivesh ke darvaaze kholti thi to media aalochana ke liye bijepi kii taraf dekhtaa tha
 The BJP did not disappoint either
 endie kii sarkaar aati he to aise faislon ke vakt media congress kii taraf nahin, rashtriya swayamsevak sangh se jude bhartiya mazdoor sangh or swadeshi jaagran manch kii taraf dekhne lagata he
 These two organizations do not disappoint
 centre sarkaar ne jab raksha, beemaa or railway main videshi nivesh ko lekar apane sudhaaron kii ghoshnaa kii thi tab swadeshi jaagran manch ne khub virodh kiya bhi tha
 Now it seems that the Modi government has gone beyond the pressure of the Sangh in economic matters
 swadeshi jaagran manch kii pratikriya main ek dilachasp mode yah aayaa he ki swadeshi jaagran manch ke dhanraj bhide ne raksha kshetra main videshi nivesh kaa swaagat kiya he magar pashupaalan ke kshetra main nivesh ko lekar naaraaz ho gaye or ise rashtravirohi faisla bataa diya balki rashtradroh kah diya
 Since 2013, 100% investment in the telecom sector is allowed
 is sector kii haalat bahut acchhee to nahin he
 Its revenue growth 6 last year
 5 pratishat tha jo 2010 ke baad sabase kam he
 It appeared in the Times of India on 30 May 2016
 pehle is sector kii rajasav vruddhi do ankon main hua karti thi
 Do we know what level of progress has been made in the sectors where 100% investment is allowed
 aankadon kii itani ghor kami he ki sari bahes dharanaon ke hisaab kitaab main hi khatm ho jaati he
 Now let's move to the next sector
 dawa companiyon ke kshetra main greenfield pharma brown field pharma main 100 fisadi nivesh kar diya gaya he
 Greenfield Pharma means when a new company is born with foreign investment
 lekin jab pehle se maujuud kisi company main nivesh kiya jaae to use brown field pharma kehete hai
 Investing in Brown Field Pharma will make the acquisition and merger process easier
 greenfield or brown field main 74 fisadi videshi nivesh hi automatic root se hoga
 Further government permission will be required
 10 june ko kai akhabaaron main khabar chhapi thi ki sarkaar dawa companiyon main videshi nivesh ke prastaav par vichaar kar rahi he
 Concern has been expressed in this case that the generic pharmaceutical industry will be threatened if foreign companies take over or merge with Indian companies
 jenrik yani bina brands kii dawaaen mahangi ho jaati hai
 On this decision, Kiran Mazumdar Shaw of pharma company Biocon Limited tweeted that it is a welcome step to bring foreign investment in the pharma sector under the automatic approval route
 ise bahut pehle hi kar diya janaa chahie tha kyonki is sector ko bahut puunji kii zarurat hoti he
 The central government has recently announced a new aviation policy
 is sector main bhi videshi nivesh ko saral bana diya gaya he
 Under this, 100% foreign investment in the new project will be made through the automatic route to build the airport
 puraane project main 74 fisadi se zyaada nivesh karne par sarkaar kii anumati leni hogi
 To modernize the airports which are running now and to ease the pressure of passengers, 100% foreigners will be able to
 brownfield airport project yani jahaan pehle se kaam chal rahaa ho vahaan sarkaar se anumati kii koi zarurat nahin he
 In the private security agency sector, 49 to 74 percent investment can be done with the permission of the government
 privet security guard kii dastaan yahaan sunaauungaa to aap ro denge
 Their salaries, poor work facilities
 ye sab kya thik ho paaegaa
 Can the government do anything to improve their conditions and conditions of service? aglaa sector he pashupaalan, jalakheti, machhlipaalan, madhumakhipaalan main 100 fisadi videshi kii anumati di gai he
 Earlier investment could be done through automatic route with some conditions
 sarkaar ne un kuch sharton ko hataa diya he
 Fish farming is fine, but a question arises from natural intelligence that we also need foreign investment in bee keeping
 gramodyog bhi nahin bachaa to kya bachaa
 But you will try to know whether foreign investment in this field opens up huge possibilities
 ab aate hai naunve number ke sector par
 Single Brand Retail
 isamen bhi atyaadhunik takniki ke bahaane riyaayaton kaa dayera bada kar diya gaya he
 The condition of the purchase at the local company has been extended to three years
 upie ke samay se hi single brands retail main kuch sharton ke saath sau fisadi videshi nivesh kar diya gaya tha
 In the year 2012-13, there was a lot of opposition to foreign investment in this sector
 tab bataaya jaataa tha ki videshi retail companiyaan aaengi to desi khudara vyapaaree barbaad ho jaaenge
 It was argued that the BJP is protesting that the business community has been its traditional vote bank
 jaise vyapaaree varg single brands retail main he hi nahin
 If you match the old political statements on the issue of foreign investment with these decisions, then the pattern of misdeeds will be seen
 tippaniyan The BJP then opposed foreign investment
 bijepi yah bhi kahati thi ki congress bhi to virodh karti thi
 When the UPA opened the doors to foreign investment, the media looked to the BJP for criticism
 bijepi niraash bhi nahin karti thi
 When the NDA government comes, during such decisions, the media does not look towards the Congress, but towards the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh and Swadeshi Jagran Manch associated with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh
 ye donon sanghathan niraash nahin karte
 When the central government announced its reforms regarding foreign investment in defense, insurance and railways, the Swadeshi Jagran Manch was also strongly opposed
 ab lagata he ki modi sarkaar aarthik maamalon main sangh ke dabaav se bhi aage ja chuki he
 An interesting twist in the response of Swadeshi Jagran Manch is that Dhanraj Bhide of Swadeshi Jagran Manch has welcomed foreign investment in defense sector but got angry about investment in animal husbandry sector and called it anti national decision but called treason 
 2013 se telecom sector main sau fisadi nivesh kii anumati he
 The condition of this sector is not very good
 pichley saal iskaa rajasav growth 6
 5 percent which is the lowest since 2010
 30 may 2016 ko times of india main ye chapa he
 Earlier this sector used to have double-digit revenue growth
 kya ham jaanate hai ki sau fisadi nivesh kii anumati jin sectoron main hai vahaan kis str kii pragati hui he
 There is such a huge lack of data that all the debate ends in the book itself according to the assumptions

 Now come to the ninth number sector
 single brands retail

 daleel di jaati thi ki bijepi isliye virodh kar rahi he ki vyapaarik samudaay uskaa paaramparik vot bank rahaa he
 Just like the merchant class is not in single brand retail
 agar aap videshi nivesh ke masale par puraane raajnneetik bayanon kaa milan in faislon se karenge to kutarkon kaa pattern hi nazar aayega
 The comments tab bijepi videshi nivesh kaa virodh karti thi
 The BJP also said that the Congress was also opposed

 The BJP did not disappoint either
 endie kii sarkaar aati he to aise faislon ke vakt media congress kii taraf nahin, rashtriya swayamsevak sangh se jude bhartiya mazdoor sangh or swadeshi jaagran manch kii taraf dekhne lagata he
 These two organizations do not disappoint
 centre sarkaar ne jab raksha, beemaa or railway main videshi nivesh ko lekar apane sudhaaron kii ghoshnaa kii thi tab swadeshi jaagran manch ne khub virodh kiya bhi tha
 Now it seems that the Modi government has gone beyond the pressure of the Sangh in economic matters
 swadeshi jaagran manch kii pratikriya main ek dilachasp mode yah aayaa he ki swadeshi jaagran manch ke dhanraj bhide ne raksha kshetra main videshi nivesh kaa swaagat kiya he magar pashupaalan ke kshetra main nivesh ko lekar naaraaz ho gaye or ise rashtravirohi faisla bataa diya balki rashtradroh kah diya

 According to the information, 2400 devices have also been installed in trains running in North India
 baharhaal trainon main divaais lagane ke daawey chahen jo bhi hon philhal trainen let ho rahi hai
 The trial of the Trinetra device to deal with fog has been a major problem for the Railways

 Its trial has also been started, but even after the end of two seasons, no concrete decision has been taken about it
 railway bordake adhikariyon kaa kahana he trinetra ko lekar alag-alag companiyon ke product ko jaancha ja chukaa he, jald hi is bare main faisla liya jayega
 Earlier in October, when Railway Minister Piyush Goyal was asked about the trains' delay, the Ministry of Railways was working on safety standards, he said - instructions have been given from our side, even if the train is late, but people are safe
 Go rail mantri ne yah baat aise samay main kahin thi jab kai rail durghatnaon se rail mantralay pareshaan tha
 The Railway Ministry has given priority to the work of safety with regard to frequent derailing trains
 rail mantralay ne sabhi sampar phatakon ko 2018 tak khatm karne ke nirdesh die hai
 Apart from this, signaling and FOB works are going on at many places in Northern Railway and North Central Railway

 ‘vimaanan companiyon dwaara abhi tak uthaae gaye kadamon se ham puri tarah santusht nahin he
 Patel said, "the fares that are being charged from the passengers making the booking at the last minute cannot be unreasonable
 ’ unhone sanket diya ki vimaanan companiyon ko dijisie dwaara sujhaaye gaye upayon ko ek nirdhaarit ‘samay seemaa’ ke bheetar lagu karnaa chahie
 It is noteworthy that DGCA and the Ministry have already issued guidelines to the airlines to maintain transparency in the fares so that the passengers are aware of how much fare will be charged from the passengers during the journey at a certain time

 The Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) chief was happy that his pulse, blood pressure, sugar level and other indicators of health were well-off, just like his political prospects
 bijepi se nitish kumaar ke alag hone ke baad lambey samay se rajya kii raajnneeti main haashie par rahe lalu kii chunavi ummiden phir se jor maarane lagi hai
 Lalu Prasad claimed in a conversation with India Today, "bihar is moving towards the fight between Lalu Prasad and Narendra Modi
" nitish kumaar ne alpsankhyak vot ke liye bijepi se rishta todgaye kaa jo dikhaava kiya he, uske baad ve aprasangik ho gaye hai
 The BJP now holds 80 percent of the nda's vote before the two parties parted

 Their enemies are divided and a multi-cornered contest is set in Bihar which can be beneficial for Lalu

 But when the RJD chief appeared ready for a tremendous comeback, then a case of sleeping for 17 years has started raising its head

 k Singh decided on June 20 that he would deliver the verdict on July 15
 iske saath hi lalu ke rajnatik bhavishya par kaala saaya mandaraane laga he
 Due to this case, on July 25, 1997, Lalu Prasad had to leave the Chief Minister's chair and surrender to the CBI court
 yah maamla chibasa tregeri (ab jharkhand main) se kathith rup se lalu kii manjuuri se 35

 The Jharkhand High Court on July 1 rejected Lalu Prasad's appeal to refer the case to another CBI court

 Lalu knows that he can take advantage of the breakdown of the BJP-JD (U) alliance only when he is out of jail, but due to no such guarantee, he has also started working on Plan b or other plan

 After the defeat in the 2010 assembly elections, it was understood that Rabri Devi had gone to the background, but in April 2012 she was made a member of the Legislative Council
 agar lalu prasad ko sajaa hui to kaman ve sanbhaalengi
 The party president can declare him or any other senior leader as the working president
 lalu prasad apane chote bete tejasvi yadav ko apane uttaradhikari ke rup main taiyaar kar rahe hai, lekin unamem apni maa kaa saath dene ke liye anubhav kii bahut kami he
 Therefore, it is understood that Lalu Prasad has brought his eldest doctor daughter Misa Bharti into politics
 misa ke do bachche hai or ve sambhavat: agle loksabhaa chunaav main khadi ho sakati hai
 In 1997, Lalu hurriedly placed Rabri Devi in the chief minister's chair, and at that time she was not even an expert in politics
 lekin is baar unhone party chalaane ke liye chaak-chauband team taiyaar kar lee he
 Along with the legal battle, Lalu will also have to prepare to live without Congress
 19 june ko vidhansabha main nitish ke vishwasamat prastaav ke samarthan main congress ke chaar vidhayakon ke vot ne saaf kar diya ki upie-2 ne lalu kii argedy ke chaar saansadon kii bajaae jediu ke 20 loksabhaa saansadon ko tarjeeh di he
 If the Congress has allied with Nitish, then some Muslim votes may come out of Lalu's hand

 congress gathbandhan karne ke maamle main phoonk-foonkkar kadam rakh rahi he
 If an RJD MP is to be believed, "if Lalu Prasad is convicted, the Congress can leave him otherwise he will be friendly with both RJD and JD (U)
" ''lalu ke dimag main ek chaal he
 Despite the Congress's support to Nitish in Bihar, Lalu Saad will continue to publicly support the Congress-led government at the Center
 argedy netaaon se kaha gaya he ki ve bijepi netaa laalkrishna adwani ke prati nitish kii kathith nishtha kii jamkar pole kholen
 The RJD did not ally with the Congress in the 2009 Lok Sabha and 2010 state assembly elections
 samaj jaataa he ki tab use donon hi maukon par bihar main kareeb aadhe muslim vot mili the
 Lalu ö Saad says, "muslims know that i will support the Congress at the national level
 main nitish kii tarah nahin jo mukhyamantri banane ke liye sampradayik bijepi kii peeth par savaar ho gaye
 Both Lalu Prasad and Nitish are trying to woo the Congress despite being socialist
 donon kii rajnatik shuruyaat congress virodh se hui thi or donon 1994 tak saath the
 Both know that they can save their existence in politics only by erasing each other
 ek ore bijepi narendra modi kii shaan main nitish ke kaseedon kii sidi baant rahi he to duusari ore argedy nitish kumaar kii shaan main laalkrishna adwani ke bhaashanon kaa prachaar kar rahaa he
 Meanwhile, Lalu Prasad is working on creating a new social equation of Rajput, Yadav and Muslim, which helped him win the Maharajganj by-election
 argedy ke chaar loksabhaa saansadon main se teen rajput hai
 Given the tug of war between political opponents, Lalu Prasad is confident that he will benefit in a multi-cornered contest, but he is ignoring the fact that if Nitish and Congress formed an anti-bjp alliance, Lalu Yadav's politics in Bihar The place may shrink
 party ke ek saansad in puure halaat ko kuch is tarah bayaan karte hai, ''lalu prasad agar bari hue to unhen phayda hoga
 If there is a jail for a few days, then a wave of sympathy will surely arise and that will shape their political future
 lekin lalu prasad argedy kii asal takat hai
 Hence, a longer jail can also create problems for RJD

 ek varisht adhikari ne kaha, hamen khushi he ki puraa abhiyaan shantipurna rahaa
 Union Minister v Narayanasamy accused the main opposition party of destabilizing the UPA government, taking a dig at the BJP as the deadlock in Parliament over the coal block allocation issue continued
 pradhanmantri karyaalay main rajyamantri narayansami ne kaha, ‘sarkaar asthir karne ke liye sansad main gatirodh kaayam rakhana bhaajapa ke iraade ke spasht sanket hai
 He said that the BJP is not going to succeed in its plan
 narayansami ne kaha, ‘yah nindaneey he ki bhaajapa is mudde par charchaa nahin chaahati he or pradhanmantri manmohan singh ke istife kii maang kar rahi he, jabaki pradhanmantri ne spasht kar diya he ki sarkaar is vishay par charchaa karne ke liye taiyaar he
 He said that the BJP was insulting the parliamentary proceedings and procedure and obstructing the functioning of Parliament
 narayansami ne kaha, ‘sansad main gatirodh hone kii sthiti main prayek din chaar karod rupaye kaa nuksaan hota he
 Narayanasamy said that when the Prime Minister intended to adopt the auction process for the allocation of coal blocks
 tab rajasthan, chhattisgarh, madhyapradesh, oreisha or pashchim bengal ke tatkaaleen mukhyamantriyon ne is kadam kaa sakht virodh kiya tha
 These Chief Ministers had written a letter to the Prime Minister expressing their willingness to set up a scrutiny committee and make the allocation based on their recommendations
 unhone kaha, ‘is tarah se aavanton paardarshee tareeke se or rajya sarkaar kii siforeeshon ke aadhaar par hua
 Narayanasamy said that there was no truth in the bjp's allegation that the UPA government had committed corruption in the allocation of coal blocks and committed irregularities
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar kii nitiyon kii aalochana karne kaa kaig ke paas koi sanvaidhanik shakti nahin he
 Narayanasamy said, 'the CAG report is only interim
 yah sansadeey prakriya ke tahat lok lekha samiti ke paas jaaegi or sambhddha pakshon ko sunne ke baad ise antim rup diya jayega
 The final report will be submitted to Parliament and action will be taken thereafter
 unhone kaha ki yadi bhaajapa is mudde par pradhanmantri ke istife kii maang karti he to use pehle apane mukhyamantriyon par dhyaan kendrit karnaa chahie or unke istife kii maang kerani chahie
 He said that coal blocks in large scale in BJP ruled states were allotted only on the basis of recommendations of Chief Ministers

 On June 18, in Kolkata, Mamata Banerjee made a big dissenting confession from an open platform of the Trinamool Congress (TMC)
 unhone is baat par niraashaa jaahir kii ki trinmul neeche tak bhrashtachar ke gart main dubi hui he or ab samay aa gaya he ki is par sakchati se kaabo paaya jaae
 Mamta also said, "I don't want a thief in the party
 jinhone logon se paisa liya he, ve jaakar unhen lautaa den
 You people are not leaving even the dead and the poor are getting 10 percent commission from the government for the last rites of their families from the 2,000 rupees

 It has been alleged that even the poorest of the poor have to give commissions to local TMC leaders to get any grant from the central or state government
 lekin mamata kii is sweekaarokti kaa isse kharaab samay or nahin ho saktaa tha
 Its original purpose may have been to try to change the image, but its effect in the campaign was reversed and it has given the opposition parties new weapons against the Trinamool
 bhaajapa rajya bhar main virodh pradarshan kar rahi he or uskaa aarope he ki vasuuli karne waalon ke khilaaf police shikaayat darj karaane vaale cader par trinmul ke log hamale kar rahe hai
 In many places, local Trinamool leaders have also been under siege by those who have been suffering from corruption
 inamen se ek shankar bagdi jaise garib gramin bhi hai
 The 'price' will have to be paid Baggadi is from Pikepada in Sainthia area of birbhum district
 unhone ek pakkaa makaan banane ke liye pradhanmantri awaas yojana-gramin (piemevai-ji) ke tahat anudaan ke liye aavedan kiya tha
 Ever since his name appeared in the list of beneficiaries three years ago, Bagdi has been visiting local Trinamool offices and meeting members of the panchayat
 unka aarope he ki is saal jab unhone trinmul ke sthaneey aakaaon ko 7,000 ru
 Then bribed the PMAW for Rs 40,000
 kii pehali kist unako mili
 Since they and Rs 3,000
 kii rishwat dene main naakaam rahe, isliye unhen dar lag rahaa he ki anudaan ke baaki bache 80,000 rupye shaayad unhen nahin mil paaenge
 Therefore, in this monsoon, Bagdi's house is still unoccupied - it has neither roof nor walls
 sarkari yojanaon ke tahat milane vaala anudaan darasal pratyaksh laabh hastantaran hota he
 But the beneficiaries allege that the leaders of the Trinamool seeking the cut-off take possession of their bank and post office documents such as passbooks and cash withdrawal slips etc
 birbhum main hathoda panchayat ke ek gaanv main rahane vaale sukhdev dolui kehete hai, ''ve anudaan raashi kaa ek-ek paisa nikaal lene ke baad hi kagajaat lautaate hai

 When i went to collect the arrears, i found that two other names were written in front of my job card in the Panchayat records

 This has become a normal process in eight years (the reign of Trinamool)
 ''sweekaarokti kaa samaykat-vasuuli ke bare main mamata kii sweekaarokti ne trinmul main sankat main ijapha hi kiya he
 Mamta is also aware that restructuring the party and branding it to cope with the bjp's challenge will mean starting afresh

 Kolkata's Presidency University Munk Professor Emeritus and sociologist Prashant Ray says, "mamata Banerjee had to take some revolutionary step to divert people's attention from the bjp's constant attack on her party
" aam logon main 'cat-mani' ek badi shikaayat rahi he
 What could have been a better way to pay attention to people's grievances and reconnect with them, to accept your mistake and apologize
 ''kalakatta uniwarsity main raajnneeti vigyaan ke purv professor sovon laal datta gupta ise chhavi badalane kii koshish ke taur par dekhte hai
 He says, "mamta is not only trying to separate herself from the Trinamool leaders who have looted people's money but is also presenting herself as an anti-corruption warrior who also takes strict action against the people of her party
" Would not hesitate to do it

 zyaadaatar maamalon main bhaajapa kaaryakarta trinmul kaaryakartaaon or netaaon se apana rajnatik hisaab chuktaa karne ke liye un par jhuthe aarope laga rahe hai
 Trinamool hopes that Mamta's jumla of returning the cut money will prove to be a masterstroke as it will create her image of a leader who is committed to fighting corruption to a micro level affecting the general public, but at present, the party's image The damage has been done

 arjuna singh ke sansmaran maranoparant chape or usase pehle hi unke parivaaravaalon ne desh ke pratham parivaar par chot kam-se-kam karne ke liye usamen upyukt pherbadal kar diya tha
 No one can believe that 83-year-old Kunwar Natwar Singh will also revolt
 nehruwad ko tamge kii tarah seene se chipkaae natwar singh ne 31 saal bhartiya videsh seva or 24 saal congress main bitaye hai or aaj bhi apni ek jamaane kii dost sonia ko badi shiddat se yaad karte hai
 He explains how he discussed the books with Sonia (sonia told him in 1988 to read Gabrielle Garcia Marquez's book One Hundred Years of Solitude), people (sonia told him things she didn't even know about Priyanka and Rahul)
 Spent hours and even political gossip (he also talked about Bill Clinton's love affair with Monica Lewinsky)
 natwar singh kehete hai, “ve rajasi bhojon ke dauraan bhi mujhe kaagaj par chutkule likhakar bheja karti thim
 "natwar Singh spent hours preparing Sonia's speeches, traveling abroad with her and did many sensitive work such as persuading Congress leaders in the name of Manmohan Singh, her choice for the post of Prime Minister
 isliye jab natwar singh ne apni nai kitaab van life ij note inf main sab kuch kah daalane kaa faisla kiya to aap samaj sakate hai ki sonia kyon baichaiyn hai or jaisaa ki natwar singh baar-baar kehete hai, kyon sonia ne apni beti priyanka ke saath unke jorbagh sthit nivas par jaakar yah kitaab na chhapavane kii chirori kii
 Is this book an attempt to draw attention to Sonia? Or is the vengeance of being left alone after the Volcker report in the grain-for-oil scandal? For Sonia's opponents, it is a hot spice
 natwar ne apni kitaab main ek se ek chaunkaane vaale bhed khole hai
 He writes that Sonia refused to become prime minister because Rahul warned that if he did, "he would do anything to stop his mother
" ” natwar ne is kitaab main likhaa he ki rahul ne apni maa ko faisla badalane ke liye 24 ghante die the
 This warning made him cry
 pichley chunaav main pradhanmantri pad ke daavedaar bataae gaye rahul ke man main satta ko lekar duvidha he jo congress ke toote manobal ke liye acha sanket nahin he
 This will discount Rahul's credibility as the trump of the party
 natwar singh yah bhi khulaasa karte hai ki unke mantralay sahit lagbhag har bade mantralay main sonia kaa koi na koi bhediya tha
 In a conversation with India Today, Natwar Singh said that Sanjay Baru, who was the media advisor to former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, rightly wrote in his book, The Accidental Prime Minister, The Making and Unmaking of Manmohan Singh, that all the files are sent for Sonia's approval Were
 natwar singh ne bataaya he ki kaise sonia narsingh raav or manmohan singh, donon kii neend haraam rakhti thim
 Rao had also complained to her that Sonia's indifference is affecting her health
 2004 main manmohan singh ne bangkok main ek hotel main natwar ko apane suite main bulaayaa or bataaya ki ve kitne ekaaki hai
 It was then a month before he became Prime Minister
 natwar singh kii yah kitaab jitani aatmakatha he utana hi desh ke ab tak ke ek sarvashaktimaan netaa kaa chithran bhi he
 Natwar Singh has explained in detail how Sahmi, panicked, shy Sonia became an ambitious, totalitarian and strong leader
 ve kabhi na kuch bhuulati hai or na kisi ko maaf karti hai
 Natwar Singh has called him anti-social-political reform
 natwar singh sonia ko ahamkaari, tunakmizaaj sanakee, chalbaaj, prima dona kehete hai or unke vyavhaar ko jaharila or dhoort bataate hai
 In Natwar's view, Sonia's likes and dislikes are very strong
 ve kisi galati ko kabhi nahin bhuulatin or na hi aalochana ko maaf karti hai
 Whether Jairam Ramesh has crossed the limits or Arjun Singh has described him as surrounded by his own circle
 kisi ko bakhsha nahin jaataa, phir chaahe vah unki saas ke puraane sahyog kenneth kaunda hi kyon na hon
 Kaunda had made the huge mistake of staying with old friend Late Lalit Suri
 suri se sonia kii naaraazgi kii vajah natwar kabhi nahin bataaenge
 He says, "the list of people who have lost their relationship with Sonia is long
" ”aakhir main sari baat anaaj ke badale tel ghotaale tak simat jaati he
 Natwar Singh believes that he was made a scapegoat in this case
 unhone likhaa he ki justise aar
 s
 pathak samiti ne unhen begunaah maan liya tha
 But how this truth has not been revealed till date to whom the money went
 natwar singh ne bataaya he ki sanyukt raashtra ke purv avar mahasachiv virendra dayaal 70,000 pannon ke dastavej laae the or unhen pravartan nideshaalay ko saunpa tha lekin unka kya hua, koi nahin jaanata
 When Natwar asked Justice Pathak why he was not investigated, he replied, "this story is long
" ” natwar kaa maananaa he ki sonia ke kehane par hi sara dosha unke sir madha gaya
 He says, "not a single leaf moves in the Congress without his knowledge
 ”lekin natwar ne sonia par jo sabase karaara prahaar kiya he, uske saamne sab feekaa he
 He writes that no Indian can ever behave like Sonia did
 unka kahana he ki sonia ke man main ek abhartiya konaa he jo logon ko bhaavanashunya hokar apni jindagi se baahar phenkane ke unke andaaj se jaahir hota he
 Natwar told India Today, "she has been in India since she was 19 years old
 unhone bharat kii har cheez ko ghotakar pi liya he, kabhi koi galati nahin kii
 Yet 25 percent of his personality can never change
 ”ye sari baaten bijepi ko bahut suhaayengi
 They know this well, yet challenge that any Congress leader should see it as a BJP conspiracy
 yah baat or he ki unke putr jagat singh rajasthan main gopalgarh se bijepi vidhayak hai or pustak kaa samaapan pradhanmantri narendra modi ko videsh niti par salaah dene ke liye natwar singh kii mulaakaat se hota he
 There is much more in this book that will spice up critics of the nehru-gandhi family
 nehru ke vafaadaar natwar singh ne edwina mountbeton ke saath pehle pradhanmantri ke prem prasang ke saath yah bhi likhaa he ki nehru ne apane patron main sarkaar ke kai raaj edbina ko bataae
 In Natwar Singh's view, Rajiv Gandhi was "the most beautiful man but mistook his trust in his troupe so that his colleague Arun Singh did not inform the Prime Minister of the General"
 sundarji ke saath milakar bharat or pakistan ko yuddh ke kagaar par khadaa kar diya tha
 Indira Gandhi is free from criticism of Natwar Singh
 natwar singh ne us jagah se uthne kaa hausala dikhaaya he jahaan har congressi bina sawaal kiye sir jhukaae baitha rahata he
 Will anyone else do this in a very weak Congress? In the last days of 1967, part of Natwar Singh's book, Indira Gandhi said to me, "natwar, before anyone else tells you, i am telling you that Rajiv is getting married
 ”maine poocha, “koun khushkismat ladki he?”“italy kii he
 The two met in Cambridge
 ”“shaadi kab he?”indira gandhi ne kaha, “farvari main
 "this was really big news
 rajeev us samay desh main sabase chahete kunvaare noujvaan the, khubasurat or behad aakarshak vyaktitv ke swami

 The marriage took place on 25 February 1968
 shrimati gandhi ne agle din hyderabad house main rajeev or sonia kii shaadi kii daavat di
 Everyone's eyes were on the bride
 mujhe aaj bhi yaad he ki sonia kitni nervas thim
 The distance from Turin to New Delhi was huge
 kattar roman catholic parivaar kii beti ekadam ajanabi maahaul main aa gai thi
 The shock of cultural change was about to shake
 bharat main sonia kaa na koi mitra tha, na bhartiya bhashaaon, samskruti, reeti-rivaaj, paramparaon, viraasat, itihaas or dharm kii koi samaj yaa jaankaree thi
 She was simply bound by her love for Rajiv and Rajiv's love for herself
 sonia ne ek baar mujhe bataaya tha ki unke jivan main kabhi koi or purush nahin rahaa
 Rajiv and he could fight all over the world to get married
 yah joda sabko lubhaa rahaa tha
 Everyone was climbing in the eyes
 khubasurat rajeev or apni shaleenta main duubin sonia
 Sonia's life can be divided into four stages
 pehla charan vaivaahik sukh, prem, masti or duniya main mashhoor saas ke sangrakshan main seekhney kaa daur tha
 Sonia walked gracefully under the shade of good luck

 Sonia and (indira's personal secretary) R

 The Congress executive passed the resolution and chose Rajiv as his mother's successor

 Sonia feared that Rajiv would also be killed
 lekin rajeev ke saamne unka kartavya tha, nijee jivan kii ahmiyat uske saamne choti ho gai
 Regardless of Sonia, the cool days were over

 Now Rajiv and Sonia could not see life from afar

 Sonia once looked very isolated
 lekin ve bahut gaharaai se is jindagi main dub chuki thim
 Initially, she was not comfortable with strangers and spoke very little
 us daur main kisi desh ke netaa ke saath unhen garmjoshi se baat karte shaayad hi kisi ne dekha hoga
 This phase also did not give them pleasure for long
 rajeev gandhi bhi honi ke shikaar hue
 Sonia's world plundered on 21 May 1991 when Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated in Sriperumbudur in Tamil Nadu
 sonia kaa jivan suunaa ho gaya
 "shankardayal Sharma said, my age is not fit to become Prime Minister" After the last rites, political activities revolved rapidly

 haksar se salaah lene kaa suzav diya
 Meanwhile, he spoke to several people including Makhanlal Fotedar
 agle din sonia ne mujhase haksar ko 10 janpath laane ko kaha
 Haksar advised that an offer be made to the party president in front of Vice President Shankar Dayal Sharma
 unka suzav tha ki aruna asaf ali or main uparashtrapati se baat karun
 Aruna Asaf Ali was very tall in the country
 unhone 1942 ke bharat chodo andolan main badi bhoomika nibhaai thi
 She knew Shankar Dayal Sharma very well
 main bhi dashakon se shankaradayal ji se parichit tha
 My first meeting with him was when he was Chief Minister in Bhopal
 ham donon ke bich naata cambridge vishvavidhyalay se bhi judata tha
 Both have been associated with him
 aruna asaf ali ne sonia kaa sandesh uparashtrapati ko sunaaya
 He patiently listened to the whole thing and then said that i am very honored and emotional after seeing so much faith of Soniaji
 uske baad jo kuch suna usase aruna ji or main bhaunchak rah gaye
 The Vice President said, “the work of the Prime Minister of India is 24 hours
 meri aayu or swasthya mujhe desh ke sabase mahatvapurn pad ke dayitvon ke saath nyaay nahin karne denge
 You tell Soniaji what is my reason for not taking up such a big responsibility

 He advised that P

 ve
 Narasimha Rao should be called
 “sonia ko narsingh ravabahut pasand nahin the”teesraa charan 1991 se 1998 tak chalaa
 Sonia lived alone, keeping Rajiv's memories alive
 unako raajnneeti main laane kii sabhi koshishen thukraa di gayi
 The highest public appeal in this regard was in the AICC meeting at Talkatora Gardens
 jab sonia vahaan pahunchin to sabhi khadey ho gaye or “sonia- sonia” ke naaron se puraa stadium gunj uthaa
 He was being urged to sit on the stage
 10 minute tak taaliyaan thamane kaa naam hi nahin le rahi thim
 a member of the Congress executive went to him and requested that he come to the podium
 lekin sonia ne saaf-saaf kah diya ki agar yah numaaish fouran band na kii gai to ve vahaan se uthakar chali jaaengi
 During that time Sonia founded the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation and published two brilliant editions about Rajiv, in which she was busy for most of the three years
 sonia ne nehru smarak nidhi or indira gandhi smarak trust kaa adhyaksh pad bhi sambhaal liya or dilli main chah antarrashtriya sammelan yojit kiye, jinamein hamane jane-maane vidwaanon, kalakaaron or rajanetaaon ko aamantrit kiya
 i suggested that Sonia organize similar conferences in different parts of the country
 har shahar main media, buddhijiviyon or vishvavidhyalayon kaa utsaah dekhne laayak tha
 Sonia Sahaj was the main attraction
 ve jitna media se dur rahati thim, media utana hi unka peechha karata tha
 She used to read only her speeches at conferences and handed over the events to me
 sonia ne pi
 V
 narsingh raav ko pradhanmantri to bana diya tha lekin unhen zyada pasand nahin karti thim
 i too had a prank with him and i joined the Tiwari Congress but later we were reunited
 maine suzav diya ki ve (raav) mohammad younus se baat karen jo baraabar sonia ke sampark main bane hue the
 Yunus was an intimate friend of the Nehru family for decades

 a few days later, after 9 pm, Narasimha Rao reached Yunus's house without his Lashkar or police vehicles
 chupchaap hui is mulaakaat main main bhi maujuud tha
 P
 for such an appointment

 With the consent of the mother, it was clear that they were keen on improving relations with Sonia
 par aisa nahin hua
 It may be that Sonia is irritated by Yunus's interference
 “sonia se bhaashan ke liye mulaakaaten bahut kshtdaai hoti thim”sonia gandhi ke jivan kaa chauthaa charan 14 march, 1998 ko shuru hua, jab nai dilli ke siri fort sabhaagaar main congress kaaryakarini kii vishesh baithak main unhone congress adhyaksh kii kursi sanbhali
 She was neither a good orator nor an expert in dialogue, while both these skills are essential for such a big politician
 unka pehla bhaashan taiyaar karne main kai ghante takalif jhelni padi
 She reached Siri Fort with Priyanka and called me and asked her to sit next
 jairam ramesh ko bhi bhaashan main kuch or rang daalane ke liye bulawaaya gaya
 Although nervous, Sonia crossed the first hurdle comfortably
 mujhe yaad he ki sonia kaa har bhaashan taiyaar karne main kitni mehnat or chah se aath ghante kaa samay lagata tha
 Sometimes painful speech meetings went on till midnight
 kabhi-kabhi ve or main akele bhaashan par kaam karte the
 She used to read speeches aloud and i used to watch time
 phir uskaa hindi anuwaad hota tha
 The Hindi translation was then written in Roman letters and printed in bold letters
 yah sthiti adhik din nahin chali
 He is almost proficient in English
 samasya hindi main he
 She cannot speak Hindi without seeing written speech
 maine suzav diya ki ve tulsidas kii ek-do chaupai yaa kabir ke dohe rat len or bhaashan main bol diya karen
 He raised his hands, "I get upset while reading what is written
 tum bina padhe bolne ko kah rahe ho? bhul jaao
 ”many big leaders of Congress sent drafts of their suggestions and speeches which were rarely used
 bhaashan taiyaar karne ke liye lambii baithkon main jairam ramesh bilanaga maujuud rahaa karte the
 His magic used to work on the computer
 ve achche saathi hai
 His mind is very sharp but his witty nature sometimes got him in trouble
 kabhi-kabhi main unke majaak kaa shikaar ho jaataa tha or sonia meri bechaini kaa majaa leti thim
 By then i had started meeting Sonia very often
 maine unhen yaad dilaayaa ki unke parivaar ke bahut se antarrashtriya mitra hai jo rajeev kii mrityu ke baad se upekshit hai
 These relationships should be rekindled and connected to them
 unhone poocha ki kaise karen
 i told that with the help of my old colleagues in the Ministry of External Affairs, i arrange for the Foreign Minister and Prime Minister to visit India
 aakhirkaar, congress adhyaksh hone ke naate ve ek myne main vipaksh kii netaa bhi to thim
 i talked to my friend Brajesh Mishra about this
 unhone inkaar to nahin kiya par vaada bhi nahin kiya
 a few months later, the Ministry of External Affairs began to include the meeting of the Congress President in the programs of foreign ministers and Prime Ministers of other countries
 pehle pahal sonia in mulakaaton ke prati utsuk nahin rahati thim
 His question was, "what shall i say to him?" My advice was, "listen, you will get a lot of information
" ” 1999 or 2005 ke bich inamen se adhiktar baithkon main main maujuud rahata tha
 a few minutes before the arrival of the guest reached 10 Janpath
 shuru-shuru main to sonia baraabar meri taraf mud jaati thim jisase mujhe badi jhenp lagati thi
 Everyone noticed this
 maine kaha ki ve aisa karne se bachein
 Gradually, the media interest in Sonia's interaction with these guests increased
 sonia ko priyanka or unke bacchon kii suraksha kii badi phikr rahati thi
 i promised to talk to Brajesh Mishra and later talked to him
 unhone sonia kii ichha ke anusaar chupchaap jaruri intjaam kar dene kaa bharosa dilaayaa tha
 My growing proximity to Sonia was also not hidden
 main lagbhag roj 10 janpath jane laga tha
 People counted me among the most trusted people in Sonia's court and some well-wishers encouraged me, "you are his best troubleshooter
 ”meraa jawaab hota tha, “bakawaas”sonia or mere bich rajnatik charchaa ekadam alag, gambhir or thos mudde par hoti thi
 However informal conversations and gossip used to be very interesting
 ek baar main apni videsh yatra se lautaa to unke pehle shabd the, “maine aapako miss kiya
 "sonia was less hesitant in front of the people, but there was still a lot to be decided
 kaaryakarini kii baithkon main bhi ve bahut kam boltin thim or rukhi lagati thim
 "sonia forces Kaunda to leave Lalit Suri's Hotel" On August 15, 1997, on the completion of 50 years of India's independence, the Indira Gandhi Memorial Trust organized an international conference and invited former President of Zambia Kenneth Kaunda
 isse pichley varshon main sabhi mehmaanon ko baraakhambha road par lalit suri ke hotel main tehraaya jaataa tha
 At the 1997 conference, Sonia decided that guests would stay at the Oberoi Hotel
 kaunda ek din baad aae or pehle kii tarah hawaii adde se sidhe suri ke hotel main pahunch gaye
 i informed Sonia about his arrival and stay at Suri's hotel
 sonia bhadak gayi or mujhse kaha ki kaunda se milakar unase oberoi main thaharne kaa anurodh karun
 This demand was clearly unreasonable
 main kaunda ko kai varsh se jaanata tha par meraa kaam katai aasaan nahin tha
 When i told Kaunda about this, he said that now he has stayed there and wants to rest after a long flight
 maine sonia ko kaunda kaa sandesh de diya
 The matter should have ended there, but it did not happen
 ahankaar haaavee ho gaya
 Sonia told me to go back to Kaunda and urge her to stay in Oberoi again
 maine bahut samajhaayaa par unhone meri ek na maani
 i even told him that his stubbornness is not true in any sense
 kaunda africa ke ek sabase sammanit or prashansit netaa the
 He was 22 years older than Sonia
 indira gandhi or rajeev gandhi kabhi kisi se aisa ruukhaa vyavhaar nahin karte the
 After hearing the second message, Kaunda said that his situation would become very bizarre
 unka kahana tha ki “bhala suri se main kya kahuunga
 Kaunda understood my condition
 maine bataa diya ki ab sambandh achche nahin hai
 Kaunda agreed to change the hotel after apologizing to Suri
 sonia jaanboojhkar sanakeepan dikhaa rahi thim
 It did not suit them
 kaunda ke saath hui yah ghatana ashobhaneey thi
 "no one else can survive after 272 support failures" In 1998, Sonia decided that the time had come for her entry into the Lok Sabha
 khandaani seat amethi se ve baari bahumat se chuni gayi
 After this it was natural to be elected the leader of the Congress Parliamentary Party
 lekin apane pehle kaarykaal main ve ek baar bhi loksabhaa main nahin boleen
 In fact, after becoming Congress President, Sonia made two big mistakes
 main viral bukhaar main bistar par padaa tha tabhi raashtrapati ke
 R
 narayanan ke samajhadaar sachiv gopalkrishna gandhi kaa phone aayaa
 He wanted me to meet Sonia Gandhi and request that he support Jyoti Basu as Prime Minister to form a secular government
 main yah baat kehane ke liye 10 janpath pahunchaa
 As i stepped into his study and conference room, i saw that Pranab Mukherjee, Arjun Singh and Makhanlal Fotedar were already there with him
 apni baat kehane ke baad mujhe laga ki ve teenon jyoti basu ke viruddh the or sonia unki taraf jhuk rahi thim
 i believed that Jyoti Basu would be better than the two previous prime ministers in many ways
 aakhirkaar macrsvaadi communist party ke paulitte beuro ne jyoti babu ko pradhanmantri banane kii anumati na dekar hamaari mushkil aasaan kar di
 Later, even though he repented his mistake, he was called a historical mistake
 doosraa galat faisla april, 1999 ke antim saptaah main hua
 When Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the leader of the National Democratic Alliance, could not form the government, there was a period of tremendous political upheaval
 congress ne anya vipakshi dalon ke samarthan se sarkaar banane kaa daawa pesh kiya
 At the behest of Arjun Singh and other leaders, Sonia met President Narayanan and claimed the support of 272 mps
 narayanan ne bahumat sabit karne ke liye do din die
 But the Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav, who had assured support on the occasion, was overturned and pulled the ground under the feet of the Congress
 26 april, 1999 ko loksabhaa bhang kar di gai
 Sonia was deeply embarrassed
 us samay tak ve raajnneeti ke akhaade main nausikhia thim or nahin jaanati thim ki yah kaisaa khooni khel he
 Had there been any other Congress leader, i would have stood outside the door after such a mess
 “vaajapeyi ne neuyork main sonia ko turant suraksha muhaiyaa kara di”2000 or 2003 ke bich sonia america gayi or uparashtrapati dick cheni tathaa videsh mantri kodolija rice jaisi hastiyon se milin
 She also went to Oxford and Hong Kong
 main unke saath tha
 His personality abroad was completely changed
 sidhi, sahaj, tanaav mukt, dusron kaa adhik khyaal rakhane vaali or kam jid karne vaali mahila ho jaati thim
 An incident in New York occurred which is appropriate to mention here
 sonia or unke pratinidhimandal ke sadsy—manmohan singh, murali devda, jairam ramesh or main—karlile hotel main tehre the
 There we arrived late in the evening
 vahaan pahunchakar mujhe pataa chalaa ki neuyork ke adhikariyon ne sonia ke liye suraksha kaa koi intjaam nahin kiya tha
 i was shocked unke kamare main koi bhi ja saktaa tha
 Sonia ignored it but i immediately called Prime Minister Vajpayee
 dilli main us samay aadhi raat kaa samay tha
 Big hearted Vajpayee said that he would call now
 takreeban aadhe ghante baad washington main hamaare rajdoot lalit maansingh kaa phone aayaa
 He told that the Prime Minister had just received a call and i have been asked to make security arrangements for Sonia Gandhi immediately
 atal bihari vaajepayi apni baat ke pakke the
 "politics thickens Sonia" Sonia's image in public is not very attractive and she herself is responsible for it to an extent
 ve apana man kisi ko nahin padhgaye deteen, apane daayre se baahar nahin nikalatin
 She is a very secretive and suspicious woman
 log unhen dekhakar hairaan hote hai, saraahte nahin
 His remarkable life reminds me of a sad Greek tale played on a vast Indian stage
 har vyakti unki jeevani likhnaa chahega
 Many people have tried this but there is something missing
 unki kitabon main saar or style pakad nahin aati he or na hi koi vishleshan or vishesh samaj hoti he
 Ever since Sonia stepped on India's soil, she has been treated with royalty
 unhone pramukh mahila kii tarah vyavhaar kiya he
 Over time, she has grown from a hesitant, nervous and shy woman to an ambitious, totalitarian and raucous leader
 unki naaraazgi congressjanon main dar paidaa karti he
 No other leader has been the party president for 15 consecutive years in the entire history of the Congress
 congress par unki pakad puri he
 Even more durable and durable than Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru
 unke netritv main asahmati kuchal di jaati he, khuli charchaa par ekadam roak he
 Silence is weaponized and every indirect signal is like a message
 barfili najar ek chetavanee he
 Opposition parties have also behaved very carefully, but now this is changing rapidly
 congress party main asafalataa yaa haar ke liye ve kabhi doshi nahin hotin or unki kabhi aalochana nahin kii jaati
 The army of Spaniards chants, "soniaji can never make a mistake
" ”apane khaas singhaasana par virajman ve kodaa fatkaraati hai or raaj karti hai

 Behind this mask, a very simple and insecure personality emerges
 unke sanakeepan kii tarif hoti he
 The image of the carved personality is promoted
 raajnneeti ne unki khaal moti kar di he
 The NDA lost the 2004 Lok Sabha elections under the shadow of the Prime Minister and the Congress formed the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) with several parties to claim majority and form the government
 har kisi ko ummid thi ki sonia gandhi pradhanmantri banengi
 Rumors began to fly when the announcement was not made as expected
 phir to tivi channelon ne elaan karnaa shuru kar diya ki sonia pradhanmantri nahin ban rahi hai
 Congress leaders' meeting was called
 meri yaaddaasht durust he to baithak main manmohan singh, pranab mukherjee, arjuna singh, shivaraj patil, gulam nabi aaazaad, maakhanlaal photedaar or main tha
 No one but me and Manmohan were aware of the purpose of the meeting
 sonia ne kaha ki unhone manmohan singh se pradhanmantri banane kaa aagrah kiya he
 Manmohan immediately said, "madam, i have not got the mandate
 ”koi kuch nahin bolaa
 i was asked to speak
 maine manmohan se kaha ki jise janadesh mila he, vah aapako saunp rahaa he
 He was to lead the UPA government
 manmohan ko pradhanmantri ke rup main sonia kaa chayan varisht congressi netaaon ko raas nahin aa rahaa tha
 Most of the members of the Congress executive were senior to him
 kaaryakarini ke sadsy isse bhi khafa the ki unhen andhere main rakhaa gaya
 The Manmohan Singh government was sworn in on 22 May
 maine bataur videsh mantri shapath lee
 In the evening i met Manmohan Singh
 ve mujhe videsh mantralay main sthapit karne ke liye kaaphi mashkkat kar chuke the or aakhri kshan tak america lobby kathith taur par ise nahin hone dena chaahati thi
 Manmohan was aware of its outcome
 unhone bataaya ki america kitne taqatvar hai or yah ki shaayad ve bharat samet kuch deshon ko asthir karne kii had tak ja sakate hai
 i praised Manmohan for the alert but also reminded him that our foreign policy is prepared in New Delhi, not in Washington DC
 beshak, main bharat-america rishte ko majboot karne kii harsambhav koshish karuunga lekin unke saamne jhukne kaa to sawaal hi nahin he
 Winston Churchill wrote, "manmohan did not sign the atomic deal", writing a biography of Lord Curzon, "the morning was like gold, the afternoon silver and the evening glass
 ” dow
 Manmohan Singh's term as Prime Minister can be described in a few words
 ve koi chhalaava nahin karte lekin apni bhaawanaaon ko chhupaae rakhane main maahir hai
 At a January 3, 2014 press conference, he described the Atomic deal as his biggest achievement
 lagbhag ek dashak tak maine isamen apni bhoomika ke bare main kuch nahin kaha
 But let me improve now
 raashtrapati jorge bush kii sarkaar main videsh mantri condolija rice ne apni aatmakatha no hair onraru e memoyar of maai iers in washington main is qaraar ke bare main likhaa he
 i begin my talk with a few lines of the same: “I met Indian Foreign Minister Natwar Singh a day earlier in his suite at the Willard Hotel
 saaf-saaf kahen to hamaare videsh vibhaag main yah baat pach nahin rahi thi ki ham ek aisi jagah baat karne ja rahe hai, jahaan press kii maujuudagi nahin hogi or maahaul bhi anaupchaarik-sa hoga
 
 
 Natwar was adamant
 ve qaraar to chaahate the lekin pradhanmantri aashwast nahin the ki ve nai dilli main is par muhar laga sakenge
 i was a little surprised, perhaps because i could not read Natwar's sign that he had the right to speak on behalf of his government
 
 
 ”hamaari baithak ke baad condolija ne raashtrapati se baat kii or unhen bataaya ki manmohan singh qaraar sampann nahin kara sakate
 Kondolija urged me to schedule a meeting and i finally managed to do it
 america videsh mantri agle din naashte par pahunchin
 She had brought a revised agreement with her so that Manmohan Singh could approve it
 main bhi maujuud tha
 When Manmohan objected to one or two points of Majmoon, i asked Foreign Secretaries Shyam Saran and Anil Kakodkar to prepare a new Majmoon by incorporating the issues mentioned by the Prime Minister
 nae majamoon ke saath condolija white house kii ore chal padin taaki use raashtrapati ko dikhaa den
 By then it was already half past nine in the morning and the meeting of George Bush and Manmohan Singh was scheduled for nine o'clock
 main pradhanmantri se pehle pahunch gaya or condolija ke bagal main baitha
 Eventually we moved forward on the agreement
 dilli lautakar maine paaya ki sonia gandhi raji nahin hai
 He asked, "natwar, how could you all agree on this?" You know that there is a kind of opposition to America's policies in the country
 ” phir bhi chah maheene baad unka dimag badal gaya

 unase meri aakhri mulaakaat 28 aktubar ko tisare pahar honi thi
 The meeting ended at five in the evening
 do ghante baad maine francfort ke liye udaan pakadi, jahaan mujhe raat bitaani thi
 The next day at five in the morning the director of my office came running and said that Nirupam Sen, India's permanent representative in the United Nations, wanted to talk to me immediately
 maine poocha, nirupam, mujhe subah-subah kyon jagaa diya
 i was surprised to hear from his mouth that the Volcker report has been submitted to the UN secretary-general
 usamen meraa, congress party kaa or kai companiyon kaa naam un labhaarthiyon main shaamil he jinke saath koi anubandh nahin tha
 According to the report, the Congress party had been doing oil business with Iraq since 1997

 Volcker never informed the Congress Party or me before including our names, when he should have done so

 That day i was restless all day

 Before leaving, i was shown a statement by Congress General Secretary Ambika Soni in which she pointed to me, "as far as individuals are concerned, they are capable of defending themselves
