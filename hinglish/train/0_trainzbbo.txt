 After Diana's death, thousands of people came to her palace to pay tribute to their beloved princess

 Finally !! At my sisters place, mastered the art of chopping onions !!! They are still laughing but i have a new skill now suhaaginen har saal pati kii lambii umr kii kaamana main karvaa chouth (karwa chauth 2018) kaa vrath rakhti hai
 The fast of Karva Chauth is considered extremely difficult
 karvaa chouth ke vrath main jitna mahatvapurn karvaa hota he, utani hi jarurichhlanibhi hoti he
 The fast of Karva Chauth cannot be completed without a sieve
 karvaa chouth ke din suhaagin mahilaayein chalni mendipakayani diya rakhkarchandako dekhne ke baad apane pati ko dekhati hai
 She ends her fast only after seeing her husband with a sieve
 dharmik manyataon ke mutabik, chandramaa ko bhagwaan brahma kaa rup mana jaataa he
 It is also believed that the moon is long
 saath hi chand sundarataa or prem kaa pratik hota he
 This is the reason that during Karva Chauth's fast, women wish their husband's long life by looking at the moon with a sieve
 ek puranic katha ke mutabik, sahuukaar kii beti ne apane pati kii lambii aayu ke liye karvaa chouth kaa vrath rakhaa tha
 But his condition started to worsen with hunger
 sahuukaar ke 7 bete bhi the
 The moneylender's sons asked their sister to eat food
 lekin sahuukaar kii beti ne khaane se inkaar kar diya
 When the condition of the brothers was not seen from the brothers, they told the sister that the moon had come out before placing a burning lamp behind a tree sieve before the moon came out
 tab unki bahan ne deepak ko chand samajhakar apana vrath khol liya tha
 But after opening the fast, her husband died
 mana jaataa he ki asalichaandko dekhe bina vrath kholane kii vajah se hi uske pati kii mrityu hui
 It is believed that from here, after seeing the moon with a sieve in his own hand, the tradition of opening the fast of Karva Chauth started after seeing the husband, so that no one can break someone's fast with deceit

 The Indian cricket team added a golden chapter to its cricketing history on Monday, ending the 72-year-long wait and winning the Test series for the first time on Australian soil
 sidney cricket ground par chauthaa or antim test match kharaab mausam or barish ke kaaran drow chuta or is tarah se bharat siries 2-1 se apane naam karne main safal rahaa
 Along with this, he also retained the border-gavaskar Trophy
 bharat ne 2017 main apane gharelu maidaanon par siries 2-1 se jitkar yah trophy jiti thi
 Before this series and during the series, all the predictions of former Australia captain Ricky Ponting were lost and the Virat Brigade beat the Kangaroos on his soil
 bharat ne swatantraaa milane ke kuch din baad pehali baar 1947-48 main lala amarnath kii aguwai main australia kaa daura kiya tha
 Then he faced Sir Don Bradman's unstoppable Australian team
 tab se lekar ab jaakar bharat kaa siries jeetne kaa intjaar viraat kohli kii team ne khatm kiya
 India created history in Australia, Test series won for the first time in 72 years
 Australia's most successful Test captain Ponting (2004-2010) predicted that in the absence of Steve Smith and David Warner, the Australian team will win the series and it will give India Will beat 2-1
 lekin hua iske ulat, team india ne australia ko 2-1 maat dekar itihaas rach daalaa
 Ponting's failure was not just a prediction, but all his predictions made in an exaggeration proved to be wrong
 siries shuru hone se pehle riki ponting ne chaunkaane vaali baat kahi thi
 He had said that in the Test series, the most runs from both teams will be scored by our Usman Khawaja
 wo main of da siries bhi rahenge
 Khwaja will beat Indian captain Virat Kohli in terms of scoring runs

 But his guess also proved to be wrong
 bharat ne melbern test 137 ranon se jitkar siries main 2-1 se badhat hasil kar lee
 In fact, Pujara scored 106 off 319 balls in the first innings of that Test, thanks to which India declared their first innings on 443 / 7
 sach to yah he ki australia kaa koi bhi ballebaaj siries main shatak nahin jamaa paaya
 For him, Marcus Harris's innings of 79 runs was the highest score in the fourth Test match
 uske ballebaajon ke liye jasprit bumraah, eshanth sharma, mohammad shami, ravichandran aswin, rabindra jadeja or kuldeep yadav ko khelnaa aasaan nahin rahaa

 Swaraj India President Yogendra Yadav called the Arvind Kejriwal government's claim of better education in Delhi a "pack of lies"
 darasal kejariwal sarkaar lagaataar dilli main behatar shiksha dene kaa daawa kar rahi he, to yogendra ne dilli sarkaar ke aankade ke aadhaar par hi kejariwal ke in daavon par sawaal uthaae
 Yogendra Yadav, citing Delhi government figures, claimed that the Kejriwal government spent a lot of money on publicity during these 20 months, but did less than the previous governments on education expenditure
 yogendra yadav ke daawey1
 After the Delhi government came to power in February 2015, the Aam Aadmi Party government presented its first budget, which called for more than doubling the education budget (106% increase)
 haalanki jo aankade saamne aae hai, wo hairaan karne vaale hai
 In fact, the 'planned component' of the budget was increased by 106% from 2,219 crore to 4,570 crore as compared to last year, not the entire budget
 jabaki asal main karch maatr 2,932 karod rupee hue hai
 That is, compared to last year (last year's education expenditure was Rs
 2,139 crores), the actual increase in expenditure on education was 37%, which was misrepresented to the general public

 The Aam Aadmi Party promised to open 500 new schools
 saal 2014-15 main dilli sarkaar ke kul 1,007 skool rashtriya rajdhani kshetra main the, jo saal 2015-16 ke ant tak badhkar yah sankhya 1,011 hui
 That is, a total of 4 new schools were opened in a year, which is much less than the number of schools opened by previous governments during their tenure
 yahaan dhyaan vaali baat yah bhi he ki dilli-ensiaar main skulon kii kul sankhya 5,798 se kam hokar saal 2015-16 main 5,796 ho gai he
 3
 dilli ke logon ko 20 nae college kaa vaada kiya gaya tha, lekin aankade bataate hai ki saal 2015-16 ke ant tak ek college kam ho gaya he
 There were 85 colleges in 2014-15, which fell to 84 in 2015-16

 There are 42,827 EWS quota seats in Delhi, but out of that 24,372 EWS quota is vacant

 ucch shiksha va kaushal guarantee skim dilli sarkaar kaa sabase bada program tha
 Under this scheme till December 30, 2016 (ie in the last year and a half), a total of 405 applications were received, in which 97 students were given loans

 15 lakhs was spent
 baaqi saare lone modi sarkaar kii aisi hi skim ke tahat diya gaya

 Yogendra, a founding member of the Aam Aadmi Party, also targeted Arvind Kejriwal's promise to make Punjab better and said that the people of Punjab should also come to Delhi, so that the reality can be known

 In this episode, Union Human Resource Minister and Rajasthan election in-charge Prakash Javadekar participated, in which he gave answers on all important aspects related to the election
 is avasar par india today ke news diarector rahul kanwal ne jab unase party kaaryakartaaon main naaraazgi or tikat bantwaare ke baad baghawat par sawaal kiya to unhone baghawat kii baat kabool to kar lee, lekin ummid jataai ki iskaa party ko koi nuksaan nahin pahonchega
 Not only this, Prakash Javadekar said in his reply that there is less rebellion in BJP than Congress
 baghawat kaa kaaran unhone satta vaapasi ko bataaya
 Javadekar said, 'whoever comes to power, there is rebellion here
 ye jo baghawat hui, usamen se saikadon logon ne apane naam waapas liye hai
 Only the ministers and mlas are the people who have been fighting, we have expelled them
 'prakaash jaavdekar ne ummid jataai ki janata baagi netaaon ko rokegi
 He also said that whether it is Congress or BJP, the people will not like any rebellion
 kaaryakartaaon main naaraazgi par kya bole jaavdekarparty ke andar naaraazgi ke sawaal par jaavdekar ne kaha ki aisa nahin he, kuch vakt pehle thodaa baatcheet kaa abhaav tha, lekin ab bilkul aisa nahin he or puri team ekajute he
 He told that 10 lakh party workers have gone door to door across the state
 bataa den ki bijepi ne party se baghawat karne vaale mantriyon, vidhayakon or padaadhikariyon ko party kii praathmik sadsyta se nishkasit kar diya he
 The rebel leaders were persuaded to withdraw their nomination after the party was cut off the ticket, but when they did not agree, 11 leaders were expelled from the party for 6 years
 baghawat par nishkasit netaaon main vartmaan sarkaar ke chaar mantri bhi shaamil hai
 The ticket of MLA Gyandev Ahuja, who gave disputed earnest money from Ramgarh seat of Alwar, has also been cut, after which he has decided to contest the election independently

 goa ke vidhansabha chunaav main congress bhale hi sabase badi party banakar ubhari, lekin iske baavjood sarkaar banane main bijepi ko kamyaabi mili
 The party's local leaders, especially Pradesh Congress Committee President Eduardo Falero, are held responsible for this failure of the Congress
 sutron se praapt jaankaree ke mutabik, congress goa main chunaav se pehle hi vijay saradesai kii goa forward party ke saath gathbandhan karnaa chaahati thi, lekin falero kii barambar aapatti kii vajah se is milaap ko amali jama nahin pahanaaya ja sakaa
 (read how Gadkari tried to form a government in Goa) After this, the central leadership of the Congress showed unceasingly pushing forward the agreement against Sardesai on the Fatorda seat of Goa
 haalanki sutron kii maane to, goa congress adhyaksh falero ne isamen bhi adnga lagane kii koshish kii or ek nirdaleey ummidavaar ko congress ke chunaav chihn par saradesai ke khilaaf khadaa karne kaa elaan kar diya
 Congress general secretary Digvijay Singh, who was in charge of Goa, came back into action and in the final moments after his efforts, Falero pulled back
 iske baad 11 march ko aae vidhansabha chunaav main congress ko 40 sadasyeey vidhansabha main 17 siten milin or bijepi ko 13 siton se santosh karnaa padaa
 Apart from this, the GPF and the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP) won 4-4 seats and two independents
 is nattejey se yah saaf ho gaya ki congress ko sarkaar banane ke liye anya partiyon se samarthan kii darkaar hogi
 After this, Digvijay Singh and former Chief Minister Digambar Kamat approached Sardesai
 thodi bahut samajhaaish ke baad saradesai sahit jipief ke do anya vidhayak congress ko samarthan dene par raji to ho gaye, lekin unhone shart rakhi ki falero kii jagah kisi or mukhyamantri banaaya jaae
 After this, Sardesai was also talked to Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi
 phir digvijay singh or unki team der raat tak digambar kaamat ko mukhyamantri banane ke liye falero ko raji karte rahe
 However, in the meantime, Union Minister Nitin Gadkari, engaged in manipulation by the BJP, tried Sardesai and other mlas of his party the same night and the next morning, the GPF mlas formally supported the BJP on the condition of making Manohar Parrikar as CM
 Announced is ghoshnaa se baukhalaaye digvijay singh or digambar kaamat ne saradesai sahit jipief vidhayakon se sampark saadhane kii bharsak koshish kii, kai phone bhi milaae lekin unka phone band aata rahaa or is tarah unki tamaam koshishon par pani phir gaya
 Two hours after this, Manohar Parrikar met Goa Governor Mridula Sinha and submitted his claim with the letter of support of the legislators needed to form the government
 kendriya grih mantri rajnath singh ne monsoon satr ke duusare din loksabhaa main kaha ki linching kii ghatnaayen pehle bhi hoti rahi hai
 It is for the state governments to take action on these incidents
 mob linching ko lekar loksabhaa main congress ne sthagan prastaav daakhil kiya tha or sadan main is mudde par charchaa kii maang kii thi
 After this, Rajnath Singh put the government's side on this issue
 unhone kaha, 'yah sach he ki desh main kai jagah linching kii ghatnaayen hoti rahi hai
 In which many people have lost their lives
 linching kii ghatnaayen pehle bhi hoti rahi hai
 The number of people killed during this period is a matter of concern for any government
 'rajnath singh ne aage kaha, 'main sarkaar kii taraf se linching kii ghatnaon kii bhartsana or aalochana karata hum
 These incidents are based on rumors and suspicions
 lekin rajya sarkaron kii yah jimmedaari he ki wo is prakaar kii ghatnaon ke khilaaf shakht or prabhavi karrwai karen
 He said, "it is a matter of the state and not of the Center
" iske baavjood centre sarkaar is par chuppi sadhakar nahin baith sakati
 In view of these incidents, the Union Home Ministry issued advisory to the states twice
 ek baar 2016 main or duusari baar july, 2018 main adwijuri jari kii gai
 We have spoken to all the Chief Ministers regarding such incidents and asked them to take strict action
 ' The Indian team suffered an embarrassing defeat in the first Test match played against South Africa at Cape Town
 haar ke baad captain viraat kohli ne bhartiya ballebaaji ko iskaa mukhya kaaran bataaya
 Kohli said after India's 72-run defeat, "we lost by almost 70 runs, if we had not lost opportunities in the first innings, they would have scored around 220 runs
" thode antaraal main kai wicket ganvaane se hamaari sthiti kharaab hui
 We were in the match on all three days and it was a great match
 ’’captain kohli kaa maananaa he kisi ek ballebaaj ko duusari pari main 70 se 80 ran banane chahie the
 Virat said that it was a great effort but one needed to score 75 or 80 runs, 20 or 30 runs were not enough
 unke paas ek gendbaaj (del sten) kam tha lekin unhone sahi kshetra main gend pich karai or apni jijaan laga di
 We also need to correct our mistakes
 ’’aapako bataa den ki bharat kii taraf se pehali pari main hardik pandya or bhubaneshwar kumaar ke bich aathven wicket ke liye 99 ran kii saajhedaari ke alaava koi bhi badi bhagidaari nahin nibhaai gai jo ki team ke chintaa kaa vishay he
 Kasidekohli, who praised Pandya, said, "the role of good partnership would have been important in this match and they did better than us
" gendbaajon ne jald hi sabak liya or duusari pari main shandaar pradarshan kiya
 He praised Pandya who scored 93 runs in the first innings
 kohli ne kaha, ‘‘hamen pandya par vishwaas he, swadesh ho yaa videsh vah hameshaa acha pradarshan karnaa chahta he
 He showed great passion and his innings was superb
 ’’dakshin africa captain phalf duplasis ne kaha ki unki team ne har samay mushkil palon main acha khel dikhaaya
 He said, "we did well in this Test every time in difficult times
 jis tarah se hamane har baar karaara jawaab diya vah shandaar tha
 Even in spite of his good bowling, we did not let the pressure build up
 ’’duplasis ne kaha, ‘‘pehali subah hamen ummid thi ki gend movement legi lekin pehle ghante main hamane kuch wicket ganvaa die
 i thought 270 was a good score but Pandya took the risk after that and he went away
 phir se gendbaajon ne jimmedaari bakhubi sanbhali
 Our strategy was to reach above 200 runs and take the lead around 350 runs
 ’’ unhone kaha, ‘‘gend jis tarah se aa rahi thi usase ham hairaan the, yah pehle din kii pich kii tarah thi

 The IOA had formed a three-member committee to oversee the postponed elections thrice, but after Qureshi's resignation, the apex body of sports in the country would have to find his option

 But i cannot hold on to my post, as the IOA accepted the government's sports guidelines, but no longer wants to follow them

 bali ne kaha ki samiksha prakiya chunaav ayog ke nae adhyaksh-sadsy kii niyukti ke baad hi shuru hogi
 After this, a very strange situation has arisen, because it will also have an impact on the elections on November 25

 Qureshi resigned, saying, "I appreciate that the IOA appointed an independent committee for the elections
" lekin main apane pad par bana nahin rah saktaa, kyonki ioe ne sarkaar ke khel dishanirdeshon ko sweekaar kiya tha, lekin ab inkaa paalan nahin karnaa chahta
 Qureshi wrote, Since my tenure as Sports Secretary, i have been following the sports guidelines of the government
 ab ioe dishanirdeshon kaa paalan nahin kar rahaa or meraa jameer mujhe pad par bane rahane kii sweekruti nahin detaa
 Staying in the committee would be a conflict of interest

 pakistan ne pulavama main siarpief ke kafile par hue hamale main aatanki sanghathan jaish-e-mohammad ke role ko chhipaane kii naakaam koshish kii he
 Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi said in a conversation with foreign media that Jaish is not responsible for the Pulwama attack
 shah mahmud kuraishi ne kaha ki jo jaish dwaara is hamale kii jimmedaari lene kii baat kahi ja rahi he isamen kanfusion he
 He has not claimed responsibility for this attack
 kuraishi ne kaha, "nahin unhone is hamale kii jimmedaari nahin lee he, isamen ek bhram kii sthiti he, bhram ye he ki jaish ke netritv ne is maamle main aisa nahin kaha he
 "shah Mahmood Qureshi was asked during an interview that after the attack Jaish himself said that he was responsible for it
 iske jawaab main kuraishi ne kaha ki unhone koi jimmedaari nahin lee he
 There is a situation of contradiction on this
 videshi media ke saath intervyuu ke dauraan unhone puri tarah se jaish ko bachaane kii koshish kii
 Explain that 40 CRPF personnel were killed in the Pulwama attack
 is hamale ke turant baad jaish ne ek video jari kar is hamale kii jimmedaari lee thi
 Let me tell you that on Friday, Shah Mehmood Qureshi in an interview given to CNN had said that Jaul's master Maulana Masood Azhar is present in Pakistan
 kuraishi ne kaha tha moulana masood ajahar behad biimaar he, uski beemaari kaa alam ye he ki wo apane ghar se nikal nahin saktaa he
 He had said that if India gives such evidence against Maulana Masood Azhar, which is valid in the court of Pakistan, then Pakistan will take action against Masood Azhar
 shah mahmud kuraishi ne bahawalpur sthit madrase kaa zikr karte hue kaha ki bharat or duniya ke kuch desh us madrase ko training camp kaa naam de rahe hai
 Qureshi said that there is a madrasa there, the media was taken there and what those people saw are in front of the world
 kuraishi ne ek baar phir se pakistan ke puraane jhooth ko doharaate hue kaha ki pakistan main nai sarkaar he or hamaari nai niti he ki ham apni dharti kaa istemaal aatanki gatividhiyon ke liye nahin honge denge
 Even if it is India
 pyaar ek bahut khaas ehsaas he or ab to ise vaigyanik bhi apni manjuuri de chuke hai
 In such a situation, one can try a million, yet it cannot reduce its importance
 koi ye nahin kah saktaa ki aisa sirf filmon main hi hota he
 There is nothing like love in real life
 pyaar ko lekar ham sabhi kii apni soch or dharanaen hoti hai lekin kai aisi baaten he jo aapako aashcharyachakit kar sakati hai
 But one thing that is certain is that love is a positive emotion that helps a human being to remain positive
 pyaar karne ke bhaavnaatmak phaayde to hai hi saath hi ye swasthya ke liye bhi bahut acha he
 Let's know some interesting and funny things related to love: 1
 kai jeev-jantuzindagibhar ek hi saathi ke saath rahete hai
 They also follow the rules of one partner
 hans, gauraiya, kai prajatiyon ke giddh or langur ek hi saathi ke saath rahete hai
 2
 jab aap apane partner kiankhon main paanch minute tak lagaataar dekhte hanto us dauraan aapkaa dil bhi usee talmail main dhadkta he
 3
 kisi shaks ko pasand karne main hamen sirf kuch minuton kaa samay lagata he
 Within a few minutes, we decide whether the person is good or not
 4
 Hugging is like a medicine
 jab aap kisi apane ke gale lagate hai to aapaki choti-choti takalif apane aap hi dur ho jaati he
 5
 kai survey main ye baat bhi kahi gai he ki agar aap akele hai to apane premi kii tasviir dekhne se aapako acha mahasoos hoga
 It has the power to give relief to pain
 6
 Love is nothing short of drunk
 vaigyanikon kaa maananaa he ki pyaar insaan ke dimag main ek aisi jagah bana letaa he jahaan use paramsukh kii anubhati hoti he
 It is the same kind of feeling that one feels after getting intoxicated
 7
 Researchers believe that when a boy only needs to interact with the girl, he pays more attention to his body-language but if he sees his life partner in that girl then his face is most important for him
 it happens

 Love has its own importance in life
 agar kisi kii jindagi main pyaar nahin he to wo avsaad or akelepan kaa shikaar ho saktaa he
 Cancer is not very common in children
 aabaadi ke aadhaar par paryaapt aankade nahin ho paane ke kaaran bharat main is tarah ke maamalon kaa puri tarah anumaan lagaana sambhav nahin he
 However, it is reported that about 40 to 50 thousand new cases of cancer occur in children below 14 years of age
 inamen se bahut se maamle diagnos nahin ho pate
 According to Gauri Kapoor, senior doctor at the Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute, lack of access to better healthcare or lack of recognition of cancer symptoms in children by primary healthcare personnel is not timely detection of the disease
 cancer se jujh rahe bacchon ke jivit bachane ke maamalon main pichley 30 varshon main sudhaar hua he
 Today, about 70 percent of cancer cases in children are treatable
 hairat kii baat he ki yah sudhaar bacchon main cancer ke ilaaj kii nai dawaaon kii khoj se nahin aayaa he, balki yah sudhaar teen chikitsa paddatiyon-chemotherapy, surgery or radiotherapy ke behatar talmail se hua he
 Gauri Kapoor believes that this success can be achieved through continuous clinical trials combining the available therapies with new innovations in treatment
 in clinical trial ko uttari america or europe main bacchon ke ilaaj kii disha main karyrat vibhinn tiimon ne anjaam diya he
 It has been consistently seen that this specialization improves the survival opportunities and quality
 american federation of clinical onchology societies kii ore se 1998 main sarvasammati se prakashit bayaan main bhi is par jor diya gaya tha
 The statement also said that timely treatment increases the expectation of better results
 beemaari ko pahchaanane aurailajashuru hone ke bich ke samay ko kam se kam karnaa chahie
 Like all developing countries here, the delay in arrival at the health center, delay in catching the disease, and the sluggish process of referring to appropriate treatment centers, reduces the cure rate
 is baat main koi andeh nahin he ki ilaaj kaa sarvshereshth mauka, pehla mauka hi hota he
 Unnecessary delays, wrong tests, incomplete surgery or inadequate chemotherapy even after adequate care negatively impact treatment
 ek ausat saamaanya chikitsak yaa bal chikitsak shaayad hi kisi bachche mencansaraki pahchaan kar pate hai
 Symptoms of cancer in children can be understood by looking at why it is delayed or why it is not recognized
 hemetological (khun se sambandhit) cancer or brain tumor ke alaava bacchon main hone vaale anya cancer jaldi vayaskon main nahin dikhte hai
 Sacerma and embryonal tumors are most common in children
 vayaskon main hone vaale cancer ke bahut se lakshan hai jo bacchon main bahut mushkil se dikhte hai
 Epithelial tissue does not play a role in cancer of children
 isliye inamen baahar raktasrav nahin hota yaa phir apithelial koshikaayen baahar papadi kii tarah nahin nikalati hai
 Symptoms of cancer in children - paleness and bleeding (eg rashes, needless bruises or blood from mouth or nose) - pain in bones
 - kisi khaas hisse menderdanheen hota auradardake kaaran baccha aksar raat ko jaag jaataa he
 - Child who suddenly starts limping or has trouble lifting weight or suddenly stops walking
 - bachche main peeth dard kaa hameshaa dhyaan rakhen
 -tb-related lumps that remain inoperative even after six weeks of treatment
 - achaanak ubharne vaale neuro sambandhi lakshan
 - Headache for more than two weeks
 - subah-subah ulti hona
 - staggering in walking
 - achaanak charbi chadhana
 Especially on the stomach, head, neck and extremities
 - akaaran lagaataar bukhaar, udaasi or vajan girnaa

 input-ians jammu-kashmir ke uri main hue aatanki hamale par mache koharaam ke bich yuan mahasabha kii meeting ho rahi he
 Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif arrived in New York on Sunday to attend the 71st session of the General Assembly, at the same time there was news of the martyrdom of 17 soldiers in a terrorist attack in Uri
 har baar kii tarah is baar bhi yuan main pakistan ke agenda main kashmir hoga
 Sharif met the pok leaders before leaving for New York and assured to raise the Kashmir issue to the UN
 buudhvaar ko sharif yuan mahasabha ko sambodhit karenge
 But he has probably forgotten that Pakistan is accused of spreading terror not only in India but also in the US, especially in the city where the Pakistani PM is going to raise the issue of Kashmir in his speech
 is dauraan antarrashtriya samudaay ke jehan main uri aatanki hamale kii ghatana bhi hogi
 In such a situation, Pakistan's ragas cry in the UN once again seems meaningless
 pakistani hukmran aakhir kis munh se yuan ke manch par bharat ke khilaaf ek labj bhi bolenge
 1
 pakistan bharat par kashmir main jyaadati kaa aarope lagaataa rahaa he or iskaa jawaab har baar bharat kootnithik manch se detaa rahaa he
 Pakistan has been demanding that a referendum be held in Kashmir under the UNK resolution
 lekin kashmir par america niti ke bare main videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa jon kirbi kehete hai ki kashmir par bharat or pakistan ko aapas main hi baat kerani chahie

 Both times Pakistan assured to resolve the Kashmir issue peacefully
 shimla samjhauta 1971 kii jang ke baad hua, to lahore ghoshnaptr par dastakhat karne ke baad pakistan ne kargil main jang ched di

 america sahit duniya ke kai mulkon ke liye chintaa kaa sabab bane al kaayda or taliban jaise aatanki sanghathanon ko pakistan kii jameen se hi khaad pani mila
 jash-e-muhammad and lashkar-e-taiba, which have become a headache for India, are also flourishing on Pakistani soil
 pakistan sena khud in aatanki sanghathanon ko bharat ke khilaaf oparation ke liye dishanirdesh detii he

 dilli main haal ke dinon kii ye sabase kufnaak vaardaat thi
 Police were receiving pieces of human body in broad daylight on Outer Ring Road, Delhi
 ghante bhar kii mashkkat ke baad police ne qareeb teen kilometre ke daayre se chah alag-alag tukdon main ek insaani laash mukammal tareeqe se baraamad karne main kamyaabi hasil kii
 But whose corpse was it? Who scattered the pieces of this corpse? And why did this murder happen? 6 pieces of dead body found on Ring Road were around 8 am on 31 March 2017
 north dilli main ring road par is rose logon kii nigaah ek aisi chiz par padi ki sabake rongte khadey ho gaye
 In the middle of the road, a man's severed head was placed so neatly, as if it was a showpiece rather than a head
 lekin kate sir kaa ye sadma bhi jaise kaafii nahin tha
 At some distance from this head, human hands and feet were also scattered in four different parts
 ye tasviren behad bhayanak thim or kisi kaufanaak vaardaat kii taraf ishaara kar rahi thi
 The murderer had planted the corpse immediately after the police arrived at the scene and the investigation was started by collecting these pieces of the corpse scattered in different parts
 police ne hisaab lagaakar dekha ki ye tukade qareeb teen kilometre ke daayre main bikhare pade the
 That is, the killer had scattered the cut off parts of the body by moving around the ring road
 taaki naa to kabhi in tukdon kaa milan ho or naa hi kabhi qatl kii is kahani kaa raaj faash ho
 Surely this was the story of such a dreadful murder in the capital of the country, which was completely blind at this time
 blind yani besurag
 Apart from these pieces of corpse, the police had no further information about this murder
 ratti bhar bhi nahin
 The police was looking at the clothed head and arms and legs, it was clear that the body belonged to a young man, but who was that young man
 kahin paas hi rahata tha yaa phir kahin dur se laakar uski laash yahaan nipataai gai thi
 All this was still secret lekin tabhi police kii nazar ek aisi chiz par padi, jise dekh use maamle kii tafteesh main pehali ummid nazar ai
 a tattoo was made on the corpse's severed arm
 likhaa tha- om sai ram
 Now this Om Sai Ram was the first and only clue with the police
 lekin sirf isi suraag kii badaulat police ke liye marane vaale kii pahchaan karnaa bhi behad mushkil kaam tha
 So, he started searching for a boy who was missing from the house in the surrounding residential areas
 haath kaa tatu bana pehla suraagring road par jahaan ye laash mili, uske paas hi dilli ke buraadi or sant nagar jaise ilaake aabaad hai
 In such a situation, the police first started searching for the missing youth at these places
 police kaa ye kaam bhuse ke dher se sui dhundhane jaisaa tha
 But the police did not back down and soon got another breakthrough
 use pataa chalaa ki vaaki sant nagar se nitin naam kaa ek noujvaan gaayab he
 And by coincidence he also has a tattoo of Om Sai Ram on his arm
 to kya ye laash nitin kii he?aise hui mritak kii pahachanpulice maranevaali kii pahchaan to kar chuki thi
 But why and who killed him was still a question
 aise main police ne ye pataa lagane kii koshish shuru kii ki akhir aakiri baar marane vaala noujvaan nitin kahaan or kiske saath dekha gaya? or isi koshish main police ke haath ek ahm suraag laga
 This clue was of a CCTV footage
 vaaki tukdon main bikhri is laash kii haalat aisi thi, jise pahchaan paanaa aasaan nahin tha
 And here it was about the mother
 wo bhala apane bete kii aisi laash kaise pahachaanati, lekin nitin ke chote bhai ne galati nahin kii
 He recognized that this corpse belonged to his brother Nitin
 sisitivi footage se mila ahm suraaglekin sawaal ye tha ki mahaz ek shaam pehle apane ghar se gum hua pachchis saal kaa nitin akhir is haal main kaise pahunchaa? uskaa qatl kisne kiya? isaki vajah kya ho sakati thi? or qaatil ne laash nipataane ke liye itnaa kaufanaak tareeqa kyon chunaa? ye tamaam sawaal har kisi ko baichaiyn kar rahe the
 But deep investigation was needed to get to the bottom of these questions
 ab police ne aas-paas ke ilaake main poochtacha shuru kii
 In this attempt, he got another clue
 suraag ek sisitivi footage kaa
 This CCTV footage of just a few seconds was captured in a chemist shop in Santnagar
 jisamen do ladke bike par jate hue dikh rahe the
 And one of these two boys was Nitin
 do yuvakon tak ja pahunchi pulicepulice ko pataa chalaa ki nitin kal shaam isi dawa dukaan ke baahar khadaa kisi se baat kar rahaa tha or baatcheet ke baad ek ladke kii bike par baith kar kahin chalaa gaya
 This was the last picture of Nitin in alive condition
 ab police ne sara jor nitin ke saath aakiri baar dikhe us ladke ko dhundh nikaalane main laga diya
 This boy was identified as Happy
 magar, happy gaayab tha
 Now the suspicion of the police deepened
 use lagane laga ki ho naa ho nitin ke qatl ke peeche happy kaa hi haath he
 Meanwhile, the police also came to know from Technical Surveillance that another boy was talking on telephone with Happy last night and both the boys' mobile location was also together at night
 ye ladkaa tha pawan
 In the hostility, the slaughtermen brutally attacked Pawan's hideout, he was not only caught, but in his house, the police saw such things, seeing that even the feet of the uniformed people were stung
 pawan ke kamare main koon se sani chadar, kapade or duusari chizein padi thi
 Moreover, the entire bed box of the house was also full of blood
 saafe tha ki nitin kaa qatl yaheen hua qaatilon ne laash nipataane se pehle use isi bed box main chupa rakhaa tha
 But the question was, why did Happy and Pawan kill Nitin? What was the enmity of both of them? Why did both choose such a dangerous way of killing 6? Happy was still absconding
 lekin qatl kii saazish ko lekar pawan ne jo kahani sunai, wo police ke liye chaunkaanewaali thi
 This was a fire of two years old enmity, which was burning in Happy and Pawan's chest since 15 August 2015
 isi ke chalate hi un donon ne milakar nitin ko maut ke ghat utaar diya or laash ko 6 tukdon main baantkar ring rod par phenk diya

 congress party ke netaa ne bataaya ki gandhi parivaar sirf 10 din ke liye hi prachaar karne utrenge
 But if the remaining 6 chief ministers and the rest of the senior leaders are talked about, then a total of 40 leaders will jointly hold about 150 meetings in Delhi

 At that time, former Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit feared that more appearances could lead to an anti-incumbency wave for the UPA

 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley made his budget speech in Hindi and English this time
 vah pradhanmantri narendra modi ke nakshekadam par chalate najar aae or aisa karne vaale khaas vitt mantri bhi ban gaye
 Finance Minister Jaitley also has a challenge to make this budget populist before next year's Lok Sabha elections and Assembly elections in eight states
 vitt mantri se pehle pradhanmantri narendra modi aksar bade aayojanon or samaaroh main hindi main bhaashan dene ko praathamikta dete rahe hai
 He is often seen doing this on foreign forums as well
 jetali ne bhi apana bajet bhaashan hindi or angreji donon bhashaaon main pesh kiya
 Azad will become India's first finance minister ,jetli introduced this time in both Hindi and English languages in his speech
 aaazaad bharat ke itihaas main ab tak sabhi vitt mantriyon ne angreji main bajet pesh kiye hai
 Jaitley did not present the entire speech in Hindi, but did present parts of it in Hindi
 hindi bhashi rajyon main chunaav he khaas vajahis baar ke bajet ko aagaamee loksabhaa chunaavon ke saath hi aath rajyon main hone vaale chunaavon ke liye bhi ahm mana ja rahaa he
 Apart from Meghalaya, Nagaland and Tripura, Karnataka and Mizoram, the Hindi speaking states of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh are also going to have assembly elections in the coming time
 aakhri teen rajya bijepi ke liye kaaphi ahm hai
 Arun Jaitley preferred to speak in Hindi to make his speech easily accessible to the voters of these states
 gramin ilaakon tak aawaaj pahunchaana makasadsutra bataate hai ki jetali ke hindi main bhaashan dene ke peeche kii ranneeti yah bhi rahi ki aam log bhi bajet ke prati ruchi len, khaskar gramin anchal main rahane vaale log
 This is the last full budget of the present Modi government and through this the government will try to woo people before the general elections
 bajet main krishi ek behad ahm hissaa hota he or is baar is sector ko vishesh tarjeeh mil sakati he
 Also, by presenting the budget in Hindi, Jaitley's aim was to make the common man interested in it, especially the interest of the farmer community towards the budget
 pehle bhi lut chuke hai vaahvahivitt mantri jetali apane pichley chaar bajet bhaashanon ke bich-bich main kai baar hindi main bolte najar aae hai
 In his last four consecutive budgets, he has also read several poetry in Hindi
 in shaayriyon par unhen sansad main taaliyaan or sansad ke baahar khub charchaaen mili hai
 This time he did the same
 unhone apni sarkaar kii uplabdhiyon ko bhi hindi main ginaya

 ham sabhi ke saath aisa hota he ki hamen bahut si chizon kii jaankaree to hoti he lekin un baton kii taarkikta pataa nahin hoti he
 The same is with some flour
 ye to ham sabhi jaanate hai ki chokar vaala aataa khaanaa phydemand hota he lekin ye phaayde kya hote hai iske bare main bahut kam logon ko hi pataa hota he
 Often flour bran is thrown in our homes in a senseless manner
 bazaar main biknevaala aataa bhi bahut maheen hota he
 Admittedly, the rotis made of such flour are soft but very few people realize how dangerous they can be
 genhun kii baat karen to iske chokar main bahut saare lavan or vitamin hote hai
 For this reason, it is also called ideal fiber
 chokar vaala aataa istemaal karnaa isliye zyada jaruri he kyonki jo tatv hamen chokar se milte hai wo or kahin se nahin mil pate hai
 Benefits of eating bran flour: 1
 chokar yukt aate kaa istemaal karne se kabj kii samasya dur ho jaati he
 It clears stool and dirt sticking in the intestines
 aanton ke saaf rahane se gas nahin banati or pet phoolne kii samasya nahin hoti he
 2
 ye amashay ke ghaavon ko bharne kaa kaam karata he
 3
 cholestrol ko santulit karne ke liye bhi chokar kaa istemaal kiya janaa chahie
 It also prevents heart related diseases by regulating cholesterol
 4
 Bran flour is very beneficial in diseases like appendicitis and hemorrhoids
 5
 It is a treasure of fiber which is also effective in reducing obesity

 It is being said that this hybrid system is quite different from the existing hybrid cars
 lambii duuri main iskaa bazaar main pradarshan kaisaa hota he, dekhnaa hoga
 At the same time, Honda has made a long list of features to make the car more premium, safe and comfortable
 ABS, EBD, whical stability acist trection control ke saath, brake acist, hill start acist or chah airbag
 At the same time, cameras for viewing from many angles
 ingine remote start kii bhi suvidha he, taaki car main ghusane se pehle hi use thanda kar saken
 Apple Car Play and Android Auto have also been given for media and internet use in the car
 teen saal kii analimited kimi kii varantee he or paanch saal kii varantee hybrid betry par he
 The comments ho saktaa he aap sochen ki pichhali acord jis qeemat range main thi, nai usase dabl qeemat main kyon aa rahi he? to uski vajah he ki ise sibiyu ke root se laayaa ja rahaa he
 In terms of price, the 3 Series of BMW, Audi's A-4 or Mercedes c-class has come in competition
 par car fichars or aaraam ke hisaab se premium bhi banaai gai he
 Except for cars in this segment, customers may also come towards the Accord Hybrid
 vahiin iskaa muqaabala jis car se filhal ho rahaa he yani toyota ki camri hybrid, uski qeemat bhi acord se teen lakh ke aasapaas kam he
 Well 
 
 bhale hi bharat main hybrid kaaron kii zyaada market nahin he, par ye bhi sach he ki graahak bhale hi paryaavaran ke bare main vaise naa sochen, jaise viksit deshon main sochate hai, lekin wo isaki kifaayat or lagzri vaale package ko pasand karenge
 In such a situation, it seems that the company has a strong package, but if it can be made or assembled in India to bring its price down, then it may surprise itself
 vahiin car ko zyaada premium, surakshit or aaraamdeh banane ke liye honda ne fichars kii lambii list lagaai he
 ABS, EBD, vehicle stability assist with traction control, brake assist, hill start assist and six airbags
 vahiin, kai angel se dekhne ke liye camere bhi
 The engine also has a remote start so that it can cool down before entering the car
 car main media or internet ke istemaal ke liye appal car play or android auto bhi diya gaya he
 There is a three-year unlimited km warranty and a five-year warranty on the hybrid battery
 tippaniyan May be you wonder why the new price is coming in double price from the price range that was in the previous record? So the reason is that it is being brought from the CBU route
 to qeemat ke hisaab se bmdablyoo ke 3 series, audi kii e-4 yaa marcedes kii si-class ke takkar main aa gai he
 But the car has also been made premium in terms of features and comfort
 ho saktaa he ki is segment kii kaaron ko chhodkar graahak acord hybrid kii taraf bhi aaen
 At the same time, the car it is currently competing with, ie the Camry Hybrid of Toyota, is also worth around three lakhs less than the Accord
 kair
 
 
 Even though there is not much market for hybrid cars in India, it is also true that customers may not think of the environment as they think in developed countries, but they will like its affordable and luxury package
 aise main yahi lag rahaa he ki company ke paas package to zordaar he par ise bharat main banane yaa assembl karke isaki qeemat ko neeche laayaa ja sake, to ho saktaa he khud ko bhi chakit kar den

 Despite all this, the question remains unanswered as to how the pesticide reached in the edible oil? The police is also investigating the matter, but even after a week, the main accused in the case, the school's headmaster Meena Devi, is away from the police
 dharmasti gandaman gaanv main sthit navsrujit praathmik vidhyalay main pichley mangalvaar ko mid de mile 23 bacchon kii maut kaa niwala ban gaya tha, jabaki rasoiyaa or 24 bachche ab bhi biimaar hai

 The remaining portions of food, oil used for cooking and pottery were also found in its quantity
 jaanch ke liye namoonay inhen se liye gaye the, jisaki patna ke forencik lab main jaanch kii gai
 It is noteworthy that before this, the Principal Secretary of the state had also told that pesticides should be replaced instead of oil in food
 unhone bataaya tha ki tel ko kadhahi main daalane ke baad kaala dhuaan niklaa tha or uskaa rang bhi anya tel jaisaa nahin tha
 The matter has now been referred to the SIT
 rajya police mukhyalay ke ek adhikari ne mangalvaar ko bataaya ki vishesh jaanch dal ne jaanch prarambh kar di he
 CID Inspector General of Police Vinay Kumar will oversee the SIT investigation, while the Special Task Force has been directed to cooperate in the arrest of the accused

 vajeer kaa tiger dekhen - Cheteshwar Pujara, an Indian batsman playing county cricket, was dismissed the ball in the match against Leicestershire
 darbishar kii ore se khelte hue pujaara chauthe number par ballebaaji karne utre or mahaj 6 ran banaakar durbhagyapurna tareeke se out hue
 Pujara had scored only six runs when in the 20th over, he saw left-arm pacer Atif Sheikh coming back towards the wicket
 unhone use haath se hataa diya jis par ampire ne unhen handled da bal out de diya
 Pujara played an important role in Derbyshire's victory against Surrey in the previous match by scoring an unbeaten 90
 vah glemorgan ke khilaaf pehle match main keval saat or 0 kaa score hi bana paae the
 Derbischer's score was 63 for three as he was dismissed in an awkward position
 first class cricket main yah 59waan mauka he, jabaki kisi khilaadi ko handled da ball out diya gaya
 On the other hand, if you talk about international cricket, till date a total of 9 batsmen have been handed the ball out
 pujaara pichley 18 saalon main pehle khilaadi hai, jinhen england main handled da ball out diya gaya
 It is also a coincidence that in 1996 Karl Kirken was dismissed in this manner against India at the same ground

 Even the Offbeat Bandit Queen, made on the life of Phoolan Devi, also recorded a grand earning at the ticket window
 lekin pichley shuukravaar ko relies hui sonchidiya ne kamai ke lihaaj se niraash kiya
 The excitement about multistarrer Sonchiriya could not be seen as seen for films based on the story of Chambal and Rugged
 sonchidiya main sushant singh rajput, bhoomi pednekar, manoj bajpeyi, ranvir shouri, ashutosh rana jaise manze abhinayta hai
 The film is directed by Abhishek Chaubey
 lekin 30 karod ke bajet main bani film pehle weekend main mahaj 4
 Was able to earn only 60 crores
 shuruyaat se hi sonchidiya kii raftaar dhimi bani hui he
 In such a situation, it is impossible to get the budget out of the film
 sonchidiya ko critics kii acchhee reating mili thi
 The rest of the b-town stars also gave good response to the movie

 kam screen par relies honamultistarar movie ke kam collection kii sabase badi vajah iskaa kam screens par relies hona bhi he
 It was released on a total of 940 screens
 sonchidiya ko bharat main 720 or oversij main 220 screens milin
 While Luka Chuppi released with Sushant Singh's film got 2100 screens in India and 407 screens in Overseas
 kam screen shering kaa nuksaan sonchidiya ko jhelana padaa he
 It is also being said that the film got less screens in rural areas
 jahaan isaki target audiyans thi
 Apart from Luka Chuppi, the comedy drama Total Dhamaal, released a week ago, also had a screen capture
 Kar rahe hai yeh baagi sajeesh luutane ki, thoda intazaar kijiye, yeh dakaiti shuru hogi 1st March se

 Non-aggressive promotion: Sonechidaria is not promoted aggressively
 haalanki tivi reality shoj main film ke lead actors ne hajiri jarur lagaai
 But a movie made on a unique subject could have been promoted better
 ye kahana galat nahin hoga ki sonchidiya apane darshakon tak pahunchane main naakaamayaab rahi he

 a tough competition from other films: Sushant Singh Rajput's film received strong competition from Total Dhamaal, which was included at the box office and also with the release of Luka Chuppi
 sonchidiya ke apojit donon hi filmein kamedi johnor kii hai
 Viewers are preferring to watch light comedy, excluding serious content
 sonchidiya kaa family antertainer naa hona bhi luka chuphi or total dhamal ke liye phydemand sabit hua
 In the last few years, many things have been banned in our country and there has been a lot of hue and cry about them

 This ban has been prohibited in Singapore since the year 1992! The ban has been forbidden! You must have heard many, but after listening to the story of Turkmenistan, you will say what happened?

 saath hi vahaan opera or ballat ko gaiyr-zaruri maanate hue is par roak laga di gai thi
 Red Card to Red Bull! Where in our country Redbull drinks openly, France banned it in 2008

 In fact, to maintain morality, this ban was brought into existence in the year 1948

 He sang the national anthem ahead of the World T20 match between India and Pakistan at the Eden Gardens in Kolkata on Saturday
 aarope he ki big bi ne raashtragan ko 52 second kii bajaae 1 minute 10 second main khatm kiya
 Big b has also been accused of using incorrect words in the national anthem
 unke khilaaf purvi dilli ke ashok nagar police stesan main shikaayat darj karai gai he
 Copy of complaint sent to PMO and Ministry of Home Affairs
 aar
 a documentary filmmaker named not only complained to the police but also sent a copy of the complaint to the Prime Minister's Office and the Ministry of Home Affairs
 apni shikaayat main ulhas ne kaha he kii amitabh kai baar saarvjaanik kaaryakramon main galat raashtragan gaate hai
 On March 19 too, Amitabh recited the national anthem in his own style, without thinking that the wrong message would be sent to his millions of fans
 raashtragan ko lekar grih mantralay ne kuch niyam banaae hai jiskaa har naagarik ko paalan karnaa hota he
 The complaint states: 1
 amitabh bachchan ne raashtragan 52 second kii bajaae 1 minute 10 second main gaaya tha
 2
 amitabh bachchan ne apni lay banaakar raashtragan gaaya
 3
 unhone 'sindhu' kii jagah 'singh' shabd kaa istemaal kiya (ye saaf taur par supreme court ke 2005 ke faisle kaa ulanghan he)4
 He used the word 'hero' instead of 'daik'
 amitabh aksar khelon kii pratispardhaa ke dauraanrashtragan gaate hai
 He has also sung the national anthem in the Pro Kabaddi League
 kam se kam big bi ko mili sikhshikayat main kaha gaya he ki ye har bhartiya kaa moulik kartavya he ki wo raashtragan kaa har tarah se sammaan kare
 Therefore, if there is no action against such a famous personality, then all the rules regarding the national anthem will be just a hoax

 1
 Independence at midnight: The Independence ceremony started at 11 am on 14 August

 Nehru said, 'in this fiddle of midnight, when the whole world is sleeping in the heat of sleep, India is opening its eyes to the atmosphere of a new life and freedom
 yah ek aisa pal he jo itihaas main bahut hi kam dikhataa he, jab ham puraane yug se nae yug main pravesh karte hai or jab ek yug khatm hota he or jab ek desh kii bahut dinon se dabaai gai aatma achaanak apni abhivyakti paa leti he
 'nehru gave this speech in English, but even then, the eyes of many non-english people were moistened
 2
 Did not bow down our tricolor: Nehru gave a memorable speech at the December 1929 Lahore session on the Tricolor
 nehru ne apane sandesh main kaha, 'ek baar phir aapako yaad rakhana he ki ab yah jhanda fahraa diya gaya he
 This tricolor should not be tilted as long as there is a single Indian man, woman, child alive
 '3
 Women victims of partition: Most women had to bear the brunt of partition
 hindu, musalmaan, sikh mahilaon kaa apharan kar balaatkaar ke anginat maamle saamne aae
 Later, when these women came back to home due to the efforts of the government, a lot of women either did not want to go home or the families of women abandoned them by saying that they were 'unholy'
 aazaadee ke baad dilli, mumbai ke veshyalayon main mahilaon kii sankhya kaaphi bad gai thi
 While addressing these women through a radio program, Nehru said, "the women who faced all kinds of problems during the partition should not think that we have any doubt about their character
" ham unhen pyaar se waapas laana chaahate hai kyonki isamen unki koi galati nahin he
 We want to keep them in our homes with great love

 '4
 jananath par nehru kii raay:oktober 1947 main pakistan kii ore se aae hamalaavaron ke kabeelai hamale main kashmir kii shanti bhang ho gai thi
 Kashmir did not join India at that time
 bharat ne samay rahete sena bhejkar kabeelai hamale ko badhane se roka tha
 After peace was established in Kashmir, Nehru wrote a letter to his sister, saying, 'I believe that the Kashmiri people will decide the fate of Kashmir
 jahaan tak meraa khyaal he mujhe isamen koi aapatti nahin he ki kashmir kamovesh aaazaad ho jaae
 But it would be a cruel joke that Kashmir should remain an exploited part of Pakistan
 '5
 Nehru's anger during Parliament debate: RV Dhulekar, a big proponent of granting national language status to Hindustani, said during the proceedings of Parliament on 10 December 1946 that those who do not understand Hindustani have no right to stay in the House and such people would If present in the house, they are not eligible to become members
 wo yahaan se chale jaaen
 An uproar in the House started on this matter

 '6
 alpsankhyakon ke prati nehru kaa najariya:raashtra ke gathan se lekar desh ke bantwaare dauraan alpsankhyakon kaa khyaal nehru ke liye badi chunauti banakar saamne ai
 Nehru once said about this, 'the way we deal with our majority society, we will also deal with the minority class
 main to kahuunga ki alpsankhyakon ke saath barabari kaa hi nahin, balki is tarah kaa vyavhaar kiya janaa chahie ki unhen iskaa ehsaas ho ki unke saath koi bhedbhaav nahin kiya ja rahaa
 '7

 '8

 On October 19, 1952, Potti Sriramlu started a fast unto death to demand Andhra Pradesh
 is anshan ko logon kaa kaaphi samarthan hasil hua
 Nehru also knew the status quo in this regard
 nehru ne 3 disambar ko madras ke mukhyamantri rajagopalaachari ko khat likhakar kaha,'andhra pradesh kii maang ke liye anshan jaisi ghatnaayen shuru hui hai or mujhe is babat vichlich kar dene vaale telegram mil rahe hai
 i am not impressed by it at all and i want to ignore it completely
 ' lekin is khat ke 12 din baad 15 disambar ko anshan ke 58wein din shriramlu kii maut ho gai
 The entire area of andhra was drowned in violence after hearing the news of the death
 hinsa ko dekhte hue shriramlu kii maut ke do din baad hi nehru ne andhra pradesh rajya ke gathan ke liye hami bhar di
 9
 nehru kii sabase badi samasya:bharat ke nirmaan main aazaadee ke baad tamaam netaaon or nagarikon ko kaaphi dikkat kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 The French writer Melroux once asked Nehru to know about his biggest problem after independence
 tab nehru ne kaha, 'nyaaypurna sadhano dwaara ek samtamulak samaaj kaa nirmaan mere liye sabase badi samasya rahi
 Perhaps the creation of a secular state in a religious country has also been a problem for me
 '10
 When Nehru conceded defeat: 26 November 1962, the day when Prime Minister Nehru announced India's defeat to the Chinese forces via radio
 nehru ne kaha, 'in chini phujon ne hamaare upar hamalaa kiya or purvi seemaa praant nefa se ye log hamaare mulk main ghus aae or unhone hamaare faujee jawan daston par hamalaa kiya
 After that there was a big battle there
 chiniyon ne itani badi fouj vahaan daali ki unhone hamaari usase choti fouj ko hataa diya or dabaa diya
 Nehru suffered a deep setback after the defeat of China, and nearly a year and a half after the defeat from China, on 27 May 1964, Nehru breathed his last and an era came to an end

 If we want to preserve our freedom, we have to fight against every oppressive power, no matter how capable they are
 hamen us bharat ke liye ladanaa he jis bharat main ham vishwaas rakhte hai, jisamen bharat main har koi aaazaad he jisaki aazaadee nirvivaad he
 Aaj Tak tried to take the reaction of some leaders of the country to Sonia's statement in the Lok Sabha
 jisamen bijepi ke netaaon ne sonia ke bayaan kii ninda kii to vahiin jammu-kashmir ke purv mukhyamantri evam varisht netaa farrukh abdulla unke paksh main najar aae
 Farooq Abdullah said, “india's condition is very bad today
 aaj logon ko dharm ke naam par baanta ja rahaa he or daman kiya ja rahaa he
 There should be movement for this
 ham saath hai, bahut se logon ne desh kii aazaadee ke liye qurbaani di hai
 The RSS had opposed the Quit India movement, this is true
 bijepi har vishay par raajnneeti karti he or dusron par aarope lagaati he
 BJP leader Kailash Vijayvargiya said, "the speech of Sonia Gandhi who has written has not understood the seriousness of the subject
" aaj bharat chodo andolan main bhaag lene vaale ko yaad karte hue charchaa karnaa tha naa kii raajnneeti karnaa
 Today, Sonia Gandhi should not do politics
 sonia gandhi ko itihaas kii puri jaankaree nahin he, isliye unhone ye bayaan diya he
 His script writer did not research properly
 "bijepineta giriraaj singh ne kaha, "mujhe unki soch par taras aata he jinhone aaj ke din raajnneeti kii he
 The Prime Minister is taking a pledge that poverty, unemployment is to be removed from the country, but some people are doing politics instead of remembering those who participated in Quit India Movement, the country will not forgive them
 sangh ko samajhnaa itnaa aasaan nahin he
 For that, nationalism has to be understood
 uske liye sangh ke itihaas ko samajhnaa hoga
 The country will not forgive the politics that Sonia Gandhi has done today

 Every person wants peace, no matter what religion they believe in
 haalanki faijabad main dukaane band hai lekin main aaj bhi apni dukaan par jaaunga

 This time no outsider has been allowed to enter the city
 ’’ khan ne kaha ki log varsh 1992 kii vaardaat ko bhula chuke hai

 karjamaafee ke vaade ne congress ko teen rajyon kii satta main vaapasi kara di
 On Monday, the Chief Ministers of Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh announced the loan waiver within a few hours of taking oath
 kisaanon ke sahare siyaasi jameen talash rahe congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ke liye karjamaafee sanjivani kii tarah he
 In such a situation, the Congress is now laying the political check of 2019 with the help of this issue
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne congress mukt bharat ke naare ke saath desh kii raajnneeti main aisi lakeer khinchi thi, jisamen centre se lekar desh ke rajyon tak bijepi hi bijepi najar aa rahi thi
 In such a difficult period, Congress President Rahul Gandhi went ahead with the issue of debt waiver of farmers to make a place in the country's politics
 mukhyamantri pad kii shapath lene ke kuch ghante ke andar hi kamalnath ne karjamaafee kii file par dastakhat kar die
 With this order, short-term crop loans of up to Rs 2 lakh given by government and cooperative banks to farmers will be waived
 empi ke baad chhattisgarh main bhi kisaanon kaa karj maaf kar diya gaya
 After Bhupesh Baghel was sworn in as Chief Minister, he held a cabinet meeting and announced to waive the debt of farmers, following the path of Kamal Nath
 soobe ke kisaanon kaa 6100 karod rupye kaa karj maaf kiya jayega
 Prior to these three states, the Congress has also implemented the promise of loan waiver of farmers in Punjab and Karnataka
 jabaki karnataka main congress jedies ke saath milakar sarkaar chalaa rahi he
 Despite this, the Congress had fulfilled the promise of loan waiver of the farmers
 congress ke karjamaafee se bijepi ke liye mushkilen khadi ho gai he
 In such a situation, even if the Modi government takes the loan waiver, the Congress will not take the credit for it
 bataa den ki congress ke netritv vaali upie-1 sarkaar ke dauraan kisaanon kii karjamaafee hui thi
 On this basis, Rahul keeps raising the issue of debt waiver of the collective farmers from the Modi government from time to time
 vah kehete rahete hai ki jab sarkaar udyogpatiyon ke karj maaf kar sakati he to kisaanon kaa karj kyon nahin?kisaanon kii karjamaafee ke sahare 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav main jeet kaa swaad chakh chuki congress ek baar phir usee mudde ke sahare 2019 kii siyaasi jang fatah karne main jute gai he
 After returning to the three states, the Congress has run a trump card by waiving debt in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh
 haal ke chunavi abhiyaanon se pehle se rahul gandhi kisaanon ke mudde par lambey samay se sangharsh kar rahe hai
 During the Mayawati government in Uttar Pradesh, the issue of Bhatta Parsaul was raised

 Rahul Gandhi arrived there on a motorcycle
 jabaki police ne bhatta parsul gaanv ke chaaron taraf nakaabandi kar rakhi thi
 Even after this, Rahul was able to reach among the farmers
 unhone apni chunavi reliyon main kisaanon kii maang lagaataar uthaai
 Rahul Gandhi visited many states to fight the peasant fight with full force
 unhone desh bhar main uttar se lekar dakshin ke rajyon main padayatraaen chilchilaati dhoop main kii thi
 Rahul started the trek from Punjab and then took a walk in Vidarbha and Telangana in Maharashtra, Kerala in connection with the problem of fishermen
 rahul bemausam barish, ativrishti or olaprabhavit un kisaanon ke ghar gaye, jinhone prakritik aapadaa aane ke baad kisi na kisi vajah se khudakushi kar lee thi

 iske baad modi sarkaar ko apane kadam peeche khinchne pade the
 Rahul had traveled 2500 km before the UP assembly elections
 kisaanon ke bich jaakar vah khaat sabha karte the
 a report on farmers across the country was also submitted by Rahul to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and said that forgive the farmers' debts

 Rahul Gandhi may have embarked on a journey from Deoria to Delhi keeping Uttar Pradesh elections in mind
 lekin unke nishane par naa to akhilesh hai naa hi mayawati
 Only PM Modi is on Rahul's target
 kisaanon ke bahaane rahul gandhi piem modi par tikhe hamale bol rahe hai
 Rahul Gandhi has been talking to the people in his big speeches about pm's foreign tours, pm's selfie and PM Modi's proximity to 10-12 industrialists and his debt waiver

 Rahul Gandhi has issue of loan waiver of farmers, electricity bill half and increase in support price of crops
 rahul gandhiye teen baaten har jagah jor-shor se uthaa rahe hai
 But while raising these three things, Rahul and PM become more attackers on Modi

 After the abolition of Article 370 from Jammu and Kashmir, Union Home Minister Amit Shah has given the first response
 kendriya grih mantri ne kaha he ki jammu-kashmir se anuchhed-370 ko khatm karne vaale bill ko pesh karne ke dauraan unke man main dar tha
 Amit Shah said that he had no doubt as a home minister that this provision of the constitution should be abolished from Jammu and Kashmir
 chennai main ek kaarykram main amit shah ne kaha ki is bill ko pesh karte vakt unke man main ashanka thi ki jab ve is bill ko rajyasabha main pesh karenge to rajyasabha chalegi kaise?chennai main rajyasabha ke sabhapati venkaiya naidu kii jindagi par ek kitaab "listening, Learning and Leading" kaa vimochan karte hue amit shah ne kaha, "andhra ke vibhaajan kaa drishy aaj bhi desh kii janata ke saamne he
 
 
 i had a little doubt in my mind that i would not be a part of such a scene
 
 
 yahi bhav ke saath
 
 
 i stood in the Rajya Sabha with this fear
 
 
 venkaiya ji kii kushalta kaa hi parinaam he ki sabhi vipaksh ke mitron ko sunate-sunate is bill ko divijan tak kahin bhi koi aisa drishy khadaa nahin hua jiske kaaran desh kii janata ko ye lage ki ucch sadan kii garima neeche ai he
 "earlier Amit Shah said that we do not have absolute majority in Rajya Sabha, yet i had decided that we will first take the bill in Rajya Sabha, then in Lok Sabha
 amit shah ne kaha ki ek saansad hone ke naate unhen pukhta yakeen he ki artical-370 ko jammu-kashmir se bahut pehle khatm ho janaa chahie tha
 As Home Minister, there was no confusion in his mind as to what the possible consequences of removing this provision could be
 amit shah ne kaha ki unhen vishwaas he ki ab kashmir se aatankwaad khatm hoga or kashmir vikaas kii disha main aage badhegaa
 During this, Home Minister Amit Shah said, "it is the law of law that Bal Venkaiah Naidu agitated against 370 and when the proposal to remove Article 370 came, Venkaiah ji was presiding over it as chairman of Rajya Sabha"
 amit shah ne ek ghatana kaa zikr karte hue kaha ki ek baar ek communist professor ne venkaiya naidu se poocha ki aapane kashmir kabhi dekha he kya? kashmir nahin dekha he to kyon andolan karte ho? venkaiya ji ne jawaab diya ki ek aankh duusari aankh ko dikhaai nahin detii, ek aankh main dard hota he to duusari aankh ko bhi turant mahasoos hota he

 India was also rewarded for bowling better than in previous matches as Ponting, who scored only 102 runs in the Australian League stage, managed 260 runs for six wickets despite a tactical innings of 104, a flat pitch at the Sardar Patel Stadium in Motera
 But there was not a big goal
 sachin tendulkar ke 53 or gautam gambhir ke 50 ran ke baavjood jab bharat kaa score paanch wicket par 187 ran tha to match par donon tiimon kaa palada baraabar lag rahaa tha
 However, Yuvraj, who took two wickets for 44 runs in ten overs in the Australian innings, made a difference between the two teams
 unhone 65 gend par aath chaukon kii madad se naabad 57 ran banaaye or suresh raina (naabad 34) ke saath 74 ran kii atoot saajhedaari kii jisase 1983 ke champion bharat 47

 Pakistan thrashed the West Indies by ten wickets in the first quarter-final yesterday
 bharat 1983, 1987, 1996 or 2003 ke baad paanchavin baar semifinal main pahunchaa he
 It is also a coincidence that in 1983, India had stopped the title campaign of the two-time champions West Indies, whereas now the Indian team forced Australia to return homeless
 ghutane kii chot se ubarkar vaapasi karne vaale virendra sahvaag : 22 gend par 15 ran: shuru se hi asahaj dikh rahe the
 Against him, the Australian referral of a catch behind the wicket in the first over of Betray Lee was turned down by the umpire but he was caught at square leg on the rising ball of Shane Watson as a second change
 tab bharat kaa score 44 ran tha
 Tendulkar dominated the game from the start
 unhone shaan tait ke pehle over main do chauke jadne ke baad mishael janson or watasan kii gendon ko bhi seemaa rekha paar bheja
 Tendulkar, who completed 18,000 runs in One Day, however returned to the pavilion before completing his century on Motera
 tait kii gudleyngth gend unke balle ko chumkar hadin ke dastaanon main samaa gayi
 He played 68 balls and hit seven fours
 gambhir (50 ran) or viraat kohli (33 gend par 24 ran) ne iske baad ek do ran lekar austrailia par dabaav banane kii koshish kii
 Both were leading the innings well with a couple of runs but Kohli gave his wicket in reward by playing a wrong shot on the fullback of David Hussey
 behtareen farm main chal rahe yuvaraj ne isi over main chaukaa jadkar apana khaataa kholaa
 He produced a good sample of his paddle sweep but was run out by his mistake after completing a serious half-century at the other end
 tab yuvaraj therdman par gend khelkar apni jagah par khadey rahe jabaki gambhir aadhi pich tak daud gayi or is tarah se unki pari 64 gend tak simit rahi jisamen do chauke shaamil hai
 Yuvraj sent a wicket of Tait in the air for four runs and then Brett Lee's third man and a four in the cover gave him confidence
 unke ek shaat ko rokane ke prayaas main lee chotil bhi ho gayi jinke powerple ke pehle over main raina ne pari kaa pehla chakka jadaa
 Yuvraj lured the audience with a winning boundary over Lee
 isse pehle austrailian pari main ponting ne ankar kii bhoomika nibhaai
 He meanwhile shared a 70-run second wicket stand with Brad Haddin (53) and a 55-run partnership for the sixth wicket with David Hussey (34 not out)

 Harbhajan Singh, who performed well against Australia, was put on the attack in the ninth over
 unhone pehle spel ke chah over main 18 ran diye lekin aakhir ke chaar over main 32 ran lutaa gayi
 But Ponting came to the crease with full commitment
 lachar farm ke kaaran media ke nishane rahe ponting ne tab ankar kii bhoomika nibhaakar jaandaar pari kheli jabaki duusare chor se wicket gir rahe the
 In the middle, when he looked to flow his innings, Zaheer Zaheer's charismatic slow ball uprooted Michael Hussey's off-stump, forcing him to play again

 He returned to the pavilion soon after with a reverse shot on Ashwin and caught in the short third man field

 Delhi keeps on echoing the anti-government slogans of farmers
 ek baar phir desh ke kone-kone se kisaan sansad ko gherne aa pahunche hai
 Ramlila Maidan in Delhi was full of farmers
 aaj raat kisaan ramlila maidan main hi guzaarenge or subah saadhe aath baje sansad kii taraf nikal padenge
 Farmers have surrounded the Parliament many times before
 kai baar march nikaal chuke hai lekin is baar kisaan apane saath gramin anchal kii mithaas bhi lekar aae he
 Farmers' organizations have also brought folk artisans from different states
 shaam hote-hote ramlila maidan main mithaas ghulne lagi
 The folk melody and folk dance began to resonate
 banaras ke ‘rajajitalab’ se aae santosh kehete hai, ‘‘ lokkalakaaron ko sang laane kaa makasad ye bataanaa he ki abhi ham thake nahin hai
 We are full of energy
 ’’nasik se aae kishan gujjar kehete hai, ‘saadhe chaar saal bitaane ke baad centre sarkaar ko phir mandir kii yaad aane lagi
 Actually the BJP is not remembering the temple but the BJP is beginning to fear defeat
 isliye phir mandir-masjid kaa khele shuru kar diya he
 The farmers of the country are dying and the rulers are playing temple-temple
 aisa nahin chalegaa
 The farmer also has the right to live a better life
 manoranjan kaa haq bhi hamen he
 That is why the band of folk artists has also come together
 ’’kisaanon kii maange or chetavanee kuch nai nahin hai
 Demand for loan waiver, appeal to implement Swaminathan report and plea to give fair value of crops
 loksabhaa chunaavon main sarkaar ko sabak sikhaane kii chetavanee
 But is everything going to happen? Then there will be a naked performance tomorrow! P
 P
 from Tamil Nadu at Ramlila Maidan
 ayakkannu apni tuuti-phooti hindi main kehete hai, ‘‘na guhaar nai he or na chetavanee
 And when the problem is not new then how to bring new requests and warnings
 ’’ve aage kehete hai ki lekin har baar kisaanon main urja nai hoti he
 The government does not get tired of committing atrocities and farmers do not protest
 ve hansate hue kehete hai, ‘dekhte hai pehle koun thaktaa he?’'haalanki tamilnadu se aae in kisaanon ne chetavanee di he ki agar shuukravaar ko unhen sansad nahin jane diya gaya to ve nagn hokar pradarshan karenge
 However, last year too, this organization from Tamil Nadu reached Jantar Mantar with a bowl in hand and the skull of dead farmers
 chuuhe or ghaas khaakar bhi in logon ne pradarshan kiya tha
 Women farmers are also in large numbers along with farmers' organizations who have come to Delhi to protest
 sanvi nasik se ai hai
 She says, "even by working in the fields, you have to die of hunger and even if you do not, you should die by protesting
 isliye main to kahati hum
 We should camp in Delhi itself
 netaaon ke ghar ke saamne katoraa lekar khadey rahe hai
 When farmers die in Delhi, there will be uproar in Parliament
 sanvi abhi barahavin main padhati hai
 In a group of fifty-sixty women, they only know Hindi
 isliye unhen is pradarshan ke liye khaas chunaa gaya he
 Chhedi Lal, who comes from Sukma in Chhattisgarh, says, "this time, there is preparation for Mahabharata in Ramlila Maidan
 ’’ unke is bayaan par jaise hi unase poocha gaya ki kya koi hinsa bhi ho sakati he to unke saathi unhen chup karakar baat taal dete hai
 Anyway, but once again the platoon of farmers has come to shake Delhi
 lekin har baar kii tarah phir vahi sawaal he ki kya is virodh se dilli main baithe hukmran pasijenge?*** While the construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya is breaking the patience of saints and saints, they have given an ultimatum to the Modi government to immediately bring an ordinance on this issue, while no one has yet been on the Ram temple within the Bharatiya Janata Party There is no discussion
 ravivaar ko dilli main dharmadesh kaarykram ke samaapan ke maukey par deshbhar se aae sadhu-santon ne ram mandir nirmaan ke liye prastaav paas kiya, jisamen kaha gaya ki ab ram mandir ke nirmaan ko lekar kisi prakaar kaa na to samjhauta hoga or na hi koi baatcheet hogi, balki iske liye sarkaar jald se jald adhyadesh lekar aae yaa phir kanoon banaae
 After this decision of the saints, the ruling BJP national spokesperson Shahnawaz Hussain told Aaj Tak that since the Ram temple case is in the Supreme Court for the last eight years, the people of the country want a law on this issue
 'party main ram mandir par charchaa nahin'santon ke faisle par jab shahanvaj hossain se sawaal kiya gaya to unhone ram mandir nirmaan kii maang ko santon kaa adhikaar bataaya
 At the same time, on the demand of the saints to make laws, he said that after looking at the facts, the government has to decide whether to enact the law or not
 haalanki, unhone bhartiya janata party ke pravaktaa hone ke naate ye bataaya ki main party kaa adhikrut pravaktaa hum or ram mandir ke nirmaan ko lekar party main abhi tak koi charchaa nahin hui he
 Shahnawaz Hussain also said that the Ram temple case is the oldest case in the country and not only the RSS or VHP, but a large population of the country wants a decision on this issue soon
 santon kii sabha main kya faisla huadharmadesh kaa do divasiy kaarykram ravivaar ko khatm hua, jisamen akhil bhartiya sant samiti ke rashtriya mahaamantri swami jitendra nand saraswati ne ram mandir nirmaan kii baat par kaha ki yah koi aagrah nahin balki aadesh he
 He said that the law should be brought and the construction of Ram temple should be completed before the elections
 agar yah nahin kiya gaya to hamen hamaara rasta pataa he
 The saints said that a lot has happened in the past too, now the temple will be constructed
 bataa den ki shahanvaj hossain kaa yah bayaan aise maahaul main aayaa he jab bijepi se jude kai bade netaa, yahaan tak ki modi sarkaar main mantri tak turant ram mandir nirmaan kii purajor tareeke se maang kar rahe hai or supreme court main sunwaayee talane par bhi sawaal uthaa rahe hai

 lakhanu main itonja ke rajapur gaanv main rahane vaali 25 varshiya bubbly gautam kanoon kii chaatra he
 Elderly father farming
 chota bhai hyskool kaa chaatr he
 As the expenses of his brother and his own education increased, Babli along with his father cultivated potatoes in 35 bighas last year
 bubbly ne pita ke saath khet main jamkar pasinaa bahaya or 900 quintal se adhik aalu paidaa kiya
 Potato was cheaper in March last year, so only 200 quintals were sold in the market and kept the rest in the nearby Bhikharipur cold store
 is aas main ki jab agast-sitambar main aalu ke daam badhenge tab ise bechakar acha munafa kamaaya jayega
 This year there was a bumper yield of potatoes in the entire state
 daam badaae kii bajaae girte chale gaye
 Potato 200 in november-december Rs
 prati quintal par pahunch gaya
 The fare of 7,00 quintal potatoes kept in cold storage is Rs
 240 only
 prati quintal tha
 Bubbly left his potato stock in cold storage to rot
 bubbly hi nahin 50 se adhik duusare kisaan bhi bhikharipur cold store se aalu lene nahin aae or yahaan 30,000 quintal se adhik aalu rakhe-rakhe sad gaya
 More than five lakh potato farmers in the state are going through their worst phase this time
 in kisaanon ne haadtod mehnat karke is baar upi main record 155 lakh ton aalu paidaa kiya
 The government could not stop the price of potato from falling due to bumper yields and farmers had to suffer
 inamen se kuch ne yaa to laagat se kam keemat par aalu bechaa yaa phir ghaataa (dekhen graphics) hone par cold storage main apana aalu sadgaye ke liye chhod diya
 The situation in Farrukhabad district in the potato belt is even worse
 yahaan mohammadabad, khanupar or yakutganj road par cold storage swaamiyon ne kareeb 15,000 quintal aalu nikaalkar sadak par phenk diya he
 Due to the smell of potato rot, there is a possibility of epidemic in the whole area
 gussaye kisaanon ne 5 janvari kii der raat rajdhani ke hyprophile suraksha vaale ilaake mukhyamantri karyaalay or vidhanbhavan ke saamne chupchaap aalu phenkakar gussa jaahir kiya
 No relief from support price: With the election promise of providing relief to the farmers, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in power, in its second cabinet meeting itself, under the market purchase scheme, the minimum support price of potato was Rs 487
 prati quintal ghoshit kar diya tha
 But it could not give any relief to the farmers
 bhartiya kisaan union ke avadh kshetra prabharee harnaam singh verma bataate hai, ''aalu kii sarkari kharid badi der se shuru hui
 By then the farmers had kept their potatoes in the cold store
 '' udyaan vibhaag ke aankade bhi isaki tasdik karte hai
 a total of 120 lakh tonnes of potatoes were kept in 1,700 cold stores in the state, while the government could only buy a little less than 13,000 quintals
 itnaa hi nahin, sarkaar ne aalu ke 300 kimi se zyada parivahan par 50 ru
 Quintal discounted
 mandi tex main 2 pratishat or ses main aadha pratishat kii di gai chhot bhi kisaanon ko raahat nahin de saki
 Sudhir Shukla, president of the Indian Potato Growers and Exporters Society, says, "the process of getting transport waivers and other benefits has been so complicated that farmers cannot take advantage of them
" '' kharid ke niyamon ke vyaavhaarik na hone se bhi kisaan sarkaar ko aalu nahin bech sake
 According to the rules, only 30 to 55 mm potatoes could be purchased at government purchasing centers, while this time the yield of potatoes is up to 80 mm if the yield is good
 utpaadan kisaan samiti, agra ke mahaamantri mohammad alamgir bataate hai, ''niyamon ke mutabik, tay aalu kaa aakaar zyaadaatar beej ke hi kaam aata he jise kharid shuru hone se pehle hi cold store main rakh diya gaya tha
 Due to no government purchase of big potato, farmers had to sell it at a lower price
 ''hakeekat main nahin utrin yojanaenjanvari, 2013 main tatkaaleen samaajawaadee party (sapa) sarkaar ne agra main pehali inwestors summit kaa aayojan kiya
 In this conference, the Ambassador of Uzbekistan had proposed to the state government for the potato-making vodka factory, but the concessions and other facilities got stuck

 Two years later in 2015, Union Food Processing Minister Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti came to Agra
 cold storage association ke padaadhikariyon se baatcheet main mantri ne agra main aalu prasanskaran unit ke liye baba ramdev kaa sahyog lene kii baat kahi, lekin abhi tak koi pahal nahin hui he
 Similarly, in 2015, the announcement of the then Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav to set up vodka plants in Farrukhabad and Kannauj proved to be airborne

 Verma says, "even now the farmer might get Rs

 Minimum support price should be declared more than per quintal
 ''chunavi saal main sarkaar kisi bhi tarah aalu kisaanon ko naaraaz nahin karnaa chaahati
 This time the government is preparing a plan to buy two lakh metric tonnes of potatoes
 pramukh sachiv udyaan sudhir garg bataate hai, ''sarkaar pichhali baar kii tulana main zyada rate par aalu kii kharid karegi

 skool kii bas roj kii tarah guuruuvaar ko bhibachchonko lekar skool ja rahi thi
 There were 49 children on the bus
 driver bacchon ko skool pahunchane kii jaldi main tha
 He was driving the bus unperturbed in his style
 bachche or driver aage hone vaali anhoni se anjaan the
 Meanwhile, in film style, a young man came riding on the bike from behind
 usne overtek kar bas ko roak liya
 Then the bus driver was beaten up and brought him down from the driving seat
 or khud bas ko lekar chal padaa
 The children on the bus did not understand anything
 tabhi kuch dur aage jaakar bas ek dukaan se takaraakar ruk gai
 The driver of the bus also came from behind making noise
 driver ke shor machaane par aas paas ke log jamaa ho gaye
 And as soon as the matter was understood, the mob caught the evildoer
 phir bheed ne aaropee kii jamkar dhunaai kii
 Then the matter was reported to the police
 uske baad aaropee ko maukey par pahunchi police ke hawaale kar diya gaya
 Police is now interrogating the accused in custody

 naye satr kii shuruuaat jeet ke saath karne ke baad team india mangalvaar ko srilanka ke khilaaf duusare ekadivasiy cricket match main jeet kii lay barkaraar rakhane ke iraade se utregi
 India had a 21-run win over Sri Lanka in the first ODI thanks to Virat Kohli's 106 and senior batsman Virender Sehwag's 96-run innings
 mahinda rajpakshe stadium main pehle vanade kii pich puri tarah se simit overon ke maichon kii pasandida pich thi jahaan ballebaajon paas jamane ke baad acchhee pari khilne kaa mauka tha
 This wicket was favorable for batting by winning the toss and Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni did the same
 shuruuaat main tej hawaaon ke kaaran gendbaajon ko gend ko swing karaane main madad mili lekin kul milakar halaat ballebaajon ke anukool the
 There may be another good news for India
 haal ke samay main srilanka kii ore se lagaataar acha pradarshan karne vaale tej gendbaaj nuwan kulshekhara groin kii chot ke kaaran shrinkhalaa se baahar ho gaye hai
 He had this injury while trying to catch a catch in the first ODI
 kal ke match main ek baar phir sabhi kii nazren viraat kohli par tiki hongi jo shandaar farm main hai or apane pichley paanch maichon main chaar shatak jad chuke hai
 Kohli's confidence would also have been boosted by scoring a century in the very first match of the season
 sahvaag ke saath bhi aisa hi he
 Sehwag, who was out of the Asia Cup due to injury, has made a great start to the upcoming busy season of Team India
 pehle match main saste main pavilion lautne vaale gautam gambhir kal pichley match is niraashaa ko bhulane ke iraade ke saath utrenge
 Suresh Raina and captain Dhoni have been consistently successful in limited overs matches and their valuable contribution in the final overs certainly makes a big difference
 rohit sharma kii utaar chadhaav bhari farm haalanki bhartiya team ke liye chintaa kaa vishay ho sakati he
 This batsman has not played according to his talent in his 81 ODI career and now he has scored just two centuries
 rohit 32 se kuch adhik kii apni ausat se bhi niraash honge or unhen aagaamee maichon main lagaataar acha pradarshan karne par dhyaan dena hoga
 However, it is unlikely that India will make any changes to their playing XI in the next few matches, provided no players are injured
 pichley match main dhimi over gati ke liye sajaa paane vaale captain dhoni haalanki apane gendbaajon se behatar pradarshan kii ummid kar rahe honge
 The presence of all-rounder Irfan Pathan has provided the necessary balance to the team
 unke gend kii gati main kaaphi kami ai he lekin nayi gend se movement hasil karne kii kshamta unhen majboot vikalp banaati he visheshkar srilanka ke sheersh kram main dilkaratne dilashaan jaise aakraamak ballebaaj kii maujuudagi ko dekhte hue
 Apart from this, India will also have to break the in-form Kumar Sangakkara, who scored 133 runs in the last match
 dilashaan or srilanka ke captain mahela jayavardhane adhik samay tak kharaab farm se nahin guzarate or apane din kisi bhi gendbaaji akraman kii dhajjiyaan udaane main sakasham hai
 India's senior fast bowler Zaheer Khan and young Umesh Yadav spent more runs in the first match and will have to concentrate on bowling economically
 bharat kii ore se pichley match main aaf spinner ravichandran aswin sarvshereshth gendbaaj the or unhone bich ke overon main srilanka ke ballebaajon par lagaam kasakar rakhi thi
 Sangakkara openly scored against the returning Pragyan Ojha but Jayawardene's wicket would certainly have boosted his morale
