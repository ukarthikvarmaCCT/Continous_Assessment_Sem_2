 pradhanmantri narendra modi ke dream project starop india ko gujarat main nai udaan mil rahi he
 This information has been given by the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP)
 diipipi ke mutabik gujarat starop ke liye anukool maahaul uplabdh karaane ke maamle main sabase acha pradarshan karne vaala rajya bana he
 The four best performing states after Gujarat are Karnataka, Kerala, Odisha and Rajasthan
 iske alaava andhra pradesh, bihar, chhattisgarh, madhya pradesh or telugana ko aguva ke taur par dekha gaya he
 While Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal are in the category of aspiring leaders
 iske alaava assam, dilli or goa sahit aath rajyon ko starop ke liye ubharta hua rajya mana gaya he
 Explain that the DIPP has released the ranking based on the performance of the states to develop more favorable mechanisms for the emerging traders
 is prakriya main 27 rajya or teen sangh shasit pradeshon ne bhaag liya
 The ranking has been done on the basis of 38 standards in seven regions
 inamen nitigat samarthan, incubetter kendron kii sthapana, shuruaati nivesh muhaiyaa karana or aasaan niyam shaamil hai
 What to say DIPP Secretary KDIPP Secretary Ramesh Abhishek said that the idea behind ranking states and union territories is not to 'embarrass' anyone, but to encourage them
 unhone kaha ki yah puri prakriya kshamta vikaas ke liye kii gai he
 So far 22 states have formulated their own startup policy
 unhone kaha ki online soochna dene, niyamon ko saral karne, sarkari kharid main praathamikta dene or venture capital fund sthapit karne jaisi gatividhiyon par rajyon ko vishesh taur par dhyaan kendrit karnaa hoga tabhi nae kaarobaari in rajyon kaa rukh kar sakenge
 If cinema is a mirror of society, its institution equipped with censorship and classification rights establishes the truth that the more things change, the more they remain the same
 isaki mukhar adhyaksh lila samson or board ke nau sadasyon ke pad chhodie se lekar pehlaaj nihalaani ko punargathit kendriya film pramann board (sibiefasi) kaa adhyaksh banaae jane tak ke safar main raajnneeti har kadam par maujuud rahi he
 While Bharatanatyam dancer and choreographer Samson has been citing "political interference" as the reason for his resignation, his successor and Bollywood filmmaker calls himself a "person associated with BJP" and calls Prime Minister Narendra Modi his "action hero"
 Do not miss to say raajnneeti ke alaava sibiefasi kai or bhi sanrachanaatmak samasyaon se jujh rahaa he
 The Justice Mudgal Report of 2013 tried to find a solution to these problems but the report of the policy stagnation that the government was stuck in during the upa's second regime was also lost
 taaja vivaad ne iske liye jameen taiyaar kar di
 The controversy was: The performance of Guru Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh's film The Messenger of God was banned by the CBFC, but the film certification appellate tribunal (FCAT) deferred the decision
 ab endie sarkaar mudgal samiti kii siforeeshon ko lagu kar cinemetography act, 1952 main sanshodhan karegi jo bharat main film certification prakriya ko sanchalit karata he
 Union Minister of State for Information and Broadcasting Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore told India Today, "we are going to implement the Justice Mudgal Committee report
 kuch mudde hai jin par ham charchaa karnaa chaahate hai, sambhawatah nyaayamurti mudgal ke saath hi
 Thereafter, the Cinematography Act, 1952 amendment will move towards a rational decision
 ’’haalanki sibiefasi ko ek swytt sanstha mana jaataa he, lekin isaki swaittata par do vajahon se sawalia nishaan lagate rahe hai; pehali baat yah ki yah apane fund ke liye soochna or prasaaran mantralay par nirbhar he, duusare sari niyuktiyaan centre sarkaar ke haath main hai
 The news of the central government's new intention may be good for the film industry as "political interference" and structural problems are linked to each other
 zyaadaatar producers kshetreey adhikariyon (aaro) or adwijuri panel ke kshetreey karyaalayon-clearence ke liye pehla padaav-se jude sadasyon kii chayan prakriya se naakhush hai
 Allegations of government interference and complaints of political bias are at this level
 samson ke saath hi pad chhodie vaale, sibiefasi sadsy anjum rajathali kehete hai, ‘‘rajnatik kaaryakarta or party samarthak adwijuri panelon main bhar die jate hai
 They show excessive vigor in improving the image of their party and the government appointed by them
 ’’ film nirmaataaon kaa aarope he ki aaro or adwijuri panel sadsy aksar ghoose kii maang karte hai yaa film paas karne ke liye anya laabh uthaanaa chaahate hai
 The only qualification required for the appointment of RO is that the officer has been a "group A" officer in the General Central Service, has a university degree, has a good knowledge of Hindi and a regional language, Indian Well-versed with culture and history and 10 years administrative experience
 in adhikariyon ko kahin se bhi liya ja saktaa he
 For example, former CBFC CEO Rakesh Kumar, who was arrested on corruption charges in August 2014, was from the Indian Railway Personal Services
 cinemetograph act, 1952 kii vyakhya ko lekar bhi aspashtataa he
 This ambiguity gives authoritarian powers to the authorities and advisory panels, which become the basis for preventing a film from being screened
 vartmaan disha-nirdesh 1983 main banaae gaye the, jane-maane nirdeshak nagesh kukanur kehete hai, ‘‘aap bas anumaan hi laga sakate hai ki kya paas karnaa he
 They demand clear guidelines to prevent unnecessary cuts
 mudgal cameti kii siforeeshon main cinemetograph act, 1952 kii jagah nayaa vidheyak laane kaa suzav he
 In addition, it is recommended to make a complete change in the guidelines that direct the certification action
 certification se jude duusare log bhi producers par bhrashtachar main shaamil hone kaa aarope lagaate hai
 Samson said in 2013, "the process takes time but the producers are not ready with their film till the last chance and want to get the job done quickly by bribing the authorities
" ’’ sibiefasi website main kaha gaya he ki puri prakriya main do maheene lag jate hai
 Manish Tiwari, who was the Minister of Information and Broadcasting in the UPA government, says, "producers with big banners send their films a day in advance, arguing that they do this to avoid piracy
" aise visheshadhikaar chote producers ko nahin hai
 Congress leader Tom Vadakkan has been a member of both the CBFC and FCAT, saying that producers often quarrel over giving the film an "A" certificate because such films cannot be given the rights to be shown on TV
 board se baari sankhya main istife or iske punargathan se bhi aaj ke digital daur main sensor board kii jarurat par hi badi bahes shuru ho gai he
 Film producer and lyricist Amit Khanna calls it backwards thinking
 ve kehete hai, ‘‘digital daur main jahaan adhik se adhik logon kii online pahunch kai tarah ke content tak he, filmon ko sensor karnaa adikalin kadam he
 "they also believe that no government will let the right to control go away
" sensor board kii bhoomika film reating kii honi chahie, kats kaa sujhav dene yaa pratibandh lagane kii nahin, ‘‘agar logon ko koi film aapattijanak lagati he to unhen apili sanstha ke paas jane kaa adhikaar ho, lekin film pradarshan ke baad hi
 Samson had also suggested earlier that censoring itself means self-censorship and voluntary grading from the producer-director is the only way
 tiwari bhi maanate hai ki certification aisi avadharana he jiskaa daur biit chukaa he or televijan programing and edwartiging ko niyamit karne vaale niyamon ke anusaar hi filmon ke liye bhi samhita taiyaar kerani hogi, ‘‘ise rokane ke liye samhita kaa ulanghan karne waalon par baari jurmaana lagaaya janaa chahie
 Samson's tenure ended last year, but Prakash Javadekar, the first Minister of Information and Broadcasting of the Modi government, requested him to continue in office until the new chairman was selected
 tiwari or rathod rajnatik hastkshep or paise kii kami ke aaropon kaa khandan karte hai
 "funds for CBFC are released to the board," says Tiwari
 mujhe kisi file par hastakshar nahin karne pade
 "rathore also agrees
" The board has adequate budget provisions, but has not been able to use them
 udhaaharan ke taur par duusare prashasnic kharch ke liye 25 lakh ru
 Are fixed but no expenditure till 31 December 2014
 ’’ rathore yah bhi bataate hai ki do filmon haidar or pike par pratibandh lagane ke maamle main sarkaar kis tarah sibiefasi ke saath khadi najar ai thi
 At present, politics does not seem to be leaving the CBFC
 pehali baat to yah ki rathod khud bhi maanate hai ki desh abhi self certification ke liye taiyaar nahin he, ‘‘agar yah jimmedaari lene vaala koi sanghathan nahin he to darshakon ke liye chayan karnaa mushkil ho jayega
 The current members of the board are the favorites of the central government
 nihalaani ne loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan bijepi ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar narendra modi ko mahimamandit karata geet ‘‘har ghar modi’’ taiyaar kiya tha
 The board has four other members; Telugu actor Jeevita Rajasekhar, actress Vani Tripathi Tikku, Bengali actor George Baker and Tamil playwright and actor S

 Shekhar - They are all BJP members
 ramesh patange dalit aresas kaaryakarta hai to film nirmaataa ashok pandit swaghoshit modi samarthak hai
 The social harmony of author Mihir Bhuta is based on Modi's speeches and writings
 khanna kehete hai, ‘‘sensor board sarkaar ke cheheton ko baitaane kaa parking ground ban gaya he
 Till date it is in the same condition
 iske 26 adhyakshon main se sirf chah yaa saat ko hi vishisht hasti yaa pad ke yogya kaha ja saktaa he
 In the last 60 years, members of all boards and regional panels were political appointees and the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting has controlled it with direct or indirect intervention
 ’’2010 main rajya sabha main tatkaaleen vipaksh ke netaa arun jetali ne ek samachar patr main upie sarkaar kii aalochana main kollam likhaa tha, ‘‘sensor board main hastkshep kii samskruti

 On Friday, there was a sudden stir in the defense colony market in Delhi
 emsidi ke kuch adhikariyon kii team baari police force ke saath yahaan aa dhamkee
 People were trying to understand, it came to know that in the famous market of Defense Colony, there is sealing of shops, bars and restaurants
 dukandaaron ne bataaya ki team ke pahunchane ke turant baad yahaan supreme court kii banaai monitering cameti ke mukhiya keje raav or bhurelaal bhi pahunche or ceiling kii karrwai shuru karne ke aadesh de die
 The police force was present along with the team, which kept the shopkeepers protesting
 darasal ceiling kii ye karrwai 2006 main chali ceiling or dimolishan kii muhim kii aage kii kadi he
 In 2006, the Supreme Court ordered the sealing of markets operating in residential areas and formed a monitoring committee to monitor this action
 is vakt dilli ke kareeb 70 fisadi bazaar ceiling kii jad main aa gaye the or hadakamp much gaya tha
 Thousands of shops were sealed, soon after, agencies like the central government, MCD and DDA came into action
 aisi sadakon ko jo rihaayshi ilaakon main gini jaati thim, unki jameen kanoonee taur par badali gai
 Some have been placed in the mix land use category and some commercial, so that the sealing can be relieved
 iske baad 2007 ke master plan main bhi badlaav karke ceiling se dilli ko raahat dilaai gai thi
 But at the same time, this rule was made that the shopkeepers present on the roads converted from commercial areas to commercial market category would have to pay conversion charge and parking charge
 kareeb do saal tak chali ceiling kii kavayad ke baad maamla in badlaavon kii vajah se thanda pad gaya tha
 As the matter cooled down, the shopkeepers did not pay the conversion charge nor did the MCD show any interest in charging the conversion charge

 The action has been initiated with Defense Colony

 ) Amitabh Bachchan is a superstar even after working for 50 years in Hindi cinema
 50 saal ke is safar main amitabh bachchan ne kai tarah ke kirdaar nibhaae hai
 Amitabh Bachchan is currently in the news for a different role in Gulabo Sitabo
 amitabh ne apane kariyar kii shuruyaat 1969 main saat hindustani se kii thi, ye baat sabhi jaanate hai, magar is film ke liye amitabh bachchan ko kitni fees mili thi ye kam log hi jaanate hai
 According to the reports, for the first film Saat Hindustani, it was said that Amitabh Bachchan was paid a fee of just Rs 5000
 ye fees kaaphi kam thi, is baat ko jaanane ke baavjood amitabh ne film saat hindustani main kaam kiya
 The reason behind this was that Amitabh did not want to miss the first opportunity
 film ne bhale hi box offis par buree tarah flop ho gai, magar is role ke liye amitabh ko neshnal aword mila
 View this post on instagramamitabh Bachchan February 15, 1969
 “I had signed k Abbas's film Saat Hindustani
 He was a close family friend
 During my school and college holidays, i would go to Abbas saab and beg him to give me a passing shot in his films so he would give me small parts
 But, in Saat Hindustani, he gave me one of the leading roles
 Abbas saab needed a heroine
 He saw Neena Singh, a friend of mine from Delhi, at my house and wanted to know if she would act in a film
 She agreed
 Neena asked me if i could give a picture of her friend who lived in Calcutta (as Kolkata was then known) and worked in Bird and Co, to Abbas saab
 Her friend, she said, was interested in cinema and wanted to become an actor
 The photograph showed a very tall man standing outside Victoria Memorial
 Abbas saab said the man had to come to Mumbai at his own expense for the audition
 He also said he did not know when the audition would take place so the aspiring actor would have to wait and would not be paid for it
 That is how Amitabh Bachchan landed up in Mumbai
 i was the one who took him to Abbas saab's office
 In the evening, i was given the dirty job of offering Amitabh Rs 5,000 for the entire film, whether it took one year or five to make
 Bunty (ajitabh) and Amitabh looked at each other
 They were absolutely shocked! Amitabh reluctantly agreed as he was desperate to act
 He got the role of the poet's friend in Saat Hindustani
 When my father got the letter from Satyajit Ray saying i could work with him, i had to give up Saat Hindustani
 So i left for Calcutta and Amitabh got the role of the poet that i was supposed to play
 It was a very powerful role! He made a tremendous impression on people in one sequence where his foot gets cut with a razor and he has to walk across the border from Goa to India

 March 12, 1993 was the day
 mayanagari bombai (ab mumbai) main roj kii jindagi daud rahi thi
 But after 1 o'clock in the afternoon, the running city came to a standstill
 ek ke baad ek lagaataar 12 dhamaakon ne shahar ko dahala diya tha
 There were serial blasts in the city
 un dhamaakon main 257 logon kii maut hui thi, jabaki 1400 log kisi na kisi tarah se jakhmi ho gaye the
 Now you must be wondering why we are referring to the Mumbai blast today
 darasal, maalegaanv kii tarah mumbai blast main bhi ek gaadi kaa angel tha
 Rubina's van connection bombed bombs in several places to destroy the city of Bombay in 2 hours and 10 minutes
 bam plant karne ke liye jis gaadi kaa istemaal kiya gaya tha, uskaa registration ek mahila ke naam par tha
 However, it was reported that the woman did not use the vehicle
 darasal, un serial dhamaakon ke baad police kii 150 sadasyon vaali team aropiyon ko pakadaney ke liye lagaai gai thi
 It was headed by DCP Rakesh Maria
 jab police dhamaakon se judi sari kadiyon ko jodne kii koshish kar rahi thi, usee dauraan jaanch padtaal ke bich police ke haath ek or ek scooter laga tha
 Both those vehicles contained hand grenades and other weapons
 jaahir taur par vine or scooter police ke liye aropiyon tak pahunchane kaa bada jariya tha
 Therefore, during investigation, the police came to know that the van was registered in the name of a woman
 us mahila kaa naam tha rubina memon
 Her fault was also that she was also a relative of Tiger Memon, the conspirator of the Mumbai blasts
 use giraftaar kar liya gaya
 The police also made him an accused in the charge sheet of the serial blast case
 is maamle kii sunwaayee tada adaalat main chalati rahi or dhamaakon ke 13 saal baad 2006 main mumbai kii tada court ne rubina ko teen anya aropiyon ke saath umrakaid kii sajaa sunai thi
 However her husband Suleman was acquitted in the case
 tab rubina or uske vakil ne court ko bataaya tha ki vine bhale hi uske naam par thi lekin wo uskaa istemaal nahin karti thi
 He was run by a relative of his
 iske baad disambar 2016 main mumbai hai court ne rubina memon kii farlo par reeha karne kii maang vaali yachika ko bhi khaarij kar diya tha
 Because he was convicted by the TADA court for his involvement in terrorist activities
 tabhi se rubina pune kii yarvada jail main band he
 The main accused in that case have been punished
 kuch aaropee abhi faraar hai
 On 16 June 2017, the TADA court ruled 7 convicts in the case
 sadhvi pragna kaa motorcycle conectionmalegaanv blast cese main aaropee sadhvi pragna singh ke khilaaf jaanch agenciyon ko kai ahm saboot mili the
 The most important evidence among them was the motorcycle used in the blast, registered in the name of Pragya Singh
 iske alaava sadhvi pragna or sandigdh hamalavar ke bich phone par hui baatcheet kuch ansh agenciyon ko mili the
 Which showed that a meeting was held in Bhopal to plot the blast
 jisamen sadhvi bhi maujuud thi
 In fact, the Maharashtra anti-terrorism Squad (ATS) called him one of the main conspirators of the Malegaon blast
 29 sitambar, 2008 maalegaanv main hue blast ke dauraan 7 log maare gaye the jabaki 101 log ghayal ho gaye the
 In October 2008, Pragya Singh was arrested
 vartmaan main wo gaiyrkanoonee gatividhi adhinium (rokthaam) samet hatya, hatya ke prayaas, aapraadhik sajeesh, or dharm ke aadhaar par vibhinn samoohon ke bich dushmani ko badhaava dene jaise aaropon kaa saamana kar rahi he
 After the Malegaon blast, the court found that accused Pragya had planned this conspiracy with the aim of spreading terror and creating communal rift in the society
 dhamaakaa karne ke liye bam ko ek improvizd explosive divaais (IED) ke saath golden rang kii lmal freedom motorcycle main feet kiya gaya tha
 The motorcycle was registered in the name of Pragya Singh Thakur
 pehle usee aadhaar par aties ne sadhvi ko giraftaar kiya tha
 The ATS said that Sadhvi had provided a motorcycle for the blast to her close aide Ramji Kalsangra
 wo bhi is maamle kaa ek vaanchit aaropee he
 In 2011, the investigation of the case was handed over from the ATS to the National Investigation Agency (NIA)
 magar 2016 main jab enie ne apni pehali final chargeshit court main daayar kii to usamen sadhvi pragna ko clin chit de di thi
 The NIA said that the ATS referred to the important evidence in the record, the motorcycle, that their investigation found that it was registered in the name of Sadhvi, but it was used by Ramchandra Kalsangra, close to Pragya
 enie kaa tark tha ki do saal se motorcycle kalsangra chalaa rahaa tha isliye sadhvi is ghatana se judi nahin thi
 Therefore no case was made against Sadhvi
 isi aadhaar par pragna singh ko 9 saal baad jamaanat mil gai thi
 He used it to keep his fingers soft, which also benefited from the ball's rotation
 us daur main na to isisi kaa hi astitv tha or na hi aaj ke daur jaise kade cricket ke niyam the
 Jamsetji took full advantage of the conditions and rules of that time

 i saw that he was writing something to the BCCI and i told Dada (sourav) about it
 maine kaha ki vah bisisiai ko likh rahe hai or yah bahut hi gambhir maamla he
 'greg Chappell was made India's coach in May 2005 and Sourav Ganguly was removed from the captaincy a year later during the Zimbabwe tour
 sachin tendulkar kii aatmakatha 'plaing it maai ve' main bhi chapel ke bare main likhaa gaya he, jisamen harbhajan singh ne kaha he, 'bhartiya cricket ko itani kshati pahunchaai ki usase ubarne main kam se kam teen varsh kaa samay lag gaya
 "he had his own personal agenda," Zaheer Khan said of the chapel
 ' yah puche jane par ki ek cricketer ke taur par unke liye sabase yaadgaar pal koun tha? sahvaag ne kaha, 'meraa pehla test shatak
 Sehwag scored 105 against South Africa in 2001
 sahvaag ne aage kaha, 'jab main vanade kheltaa tha, to log yah kehete the ki main test cricket nahin khel saktaa
 So when i hit my first century, i hugged Ganguly because he gave me a chance to play Test cricket
 main khud kaa sabit karnaa chahta tha
 On the question of being fed as an opener by Ganguly and coach John Wright, he said, 'I told him that Sachin has always started batting and Sourav has also played as an opener
 mujhe madhyakram main hi ballebaaji karne dijie
 But, Sourav and John said that you have to sit outside because this is the only place for you in the team
 ' After Aaj Tak's conversion, the central government has come into action
 maamle main chuppi todate hue kendriya grahamantri rajnath singh ne kaha ki popular front of india (PFI) ke khilaaf kadi karrwai kii jaaegi
 In this case the agencies are working on the ground
 ajtak se vishesh baatcheet main kendriya grahamantri ne kaha ki ajtak ke sting oparation main dharmantaran ke khulaase ke baad karrwai kii gai he
 He said that the culprits of the case will not be spared
 centre sarkaar kii ore se pehali baar is maamle main itane ucch str se pratikriya ai he
 It is believed that now the government may soon ban the PFI and its radical charity
 isse pehle ajtak ke oparation dharmantaran ko lekar kendriya grih rajyamantri hansraj ahir ne kaha ki koi bhi vyakti dharmantaran balpurvak nahin kara saktaa
 Ahir also said that in the sting operation done by Aaj Tak, it is clear that the deadly acts of PFI are going on
 desh ke bahari deshon se madad lekar is kaam ko anjaam diya ja rahaa he
 It also includes terrorist organizations, which are engaged in this work of conversion
 kendriya grih rajya mantri ahir ke paas ai thi shikayatakendriya grih rajya mantri ahirne kaha ki jo baat aap log saamne lekar aae hai, main bhi jab may june main kerala gaya tha, to mere paas bhi aisi shikaayat ai thi
 It was said that more than one thousand people were converted in a month
 hansraj ahir ne kaha ki vahaan kii police se bhi hamane report maangi he ki kaise ye dharmantaran kaa nexs chal rahaa he? uski jaankaree den
 Hansraj Ahir told that the DGP also said that he has information about the conversion of 3000 people in 3 months

 It is clear from this that how is conversion taking place? The Minister of State for Home said that the sting that Aaj Tak has done in which the intention of PFI is coming out
 jabaran dharmantaran karana aparaadh he
 The central government is working to curb this
 is masale ko lekar NIA jaanch kar rahi he
 Hansraj Ahir said- action will definitely be taken: Union Minister of State for Home Affairs Hansraj Ahir said that now the disclosure of this matter is coming out from Aaj Tak
 ham jarur ection lenge
 This work is wrong
 enie ke paas jo bhi report aana he wo aa gai he
 In such a situation, if there is a need to ban (PFI), there will definitely be a ban
 is par nigaraanee bhi rakhi jaaegi
 Union Minister of State for Home Hansraj Ahir said that if anything is brought to the fore through the press, then we see it
 MHA puure oparation ko study karegaa or usko aadhaar banaakar karrwai karenge
 Ahir said that the operation may also be used in the Supreme Court
 dharm parivartan ke aaropon ko khaarij karata rahaa he pfisarvajanika taur par kerala kaa popular front of india (PFI) khud ko ekta or samanta kaa almbardaar bataata he
 At the same time, it has consistently denied allegations of conversion, hawala funding, murderous attacks and terrorism
 haalanki ajtak kii special investegative team ne apni jaanch main khud ko dharmarth bataane vaale is sanghathan ke asli chehre ko benakaab kar diya he
 Aaj Tak's Under Cover Reporters had made such disclosures, the Under Cover Reporters of Aaj Tak have made such disclosures on the hidden cameras from the mouths of the top officials of the PFI who are about to throw them away
 chaahe wo bade str par dharm parivartan karana ho, avaidh funding ho, yaa phir bharat ko dharmpradhan islamic desh banane kaa antim lakshya
 They can be seen and heard all about themselves
 PFI pehle se hi rashtriya jaanch agency (NIA) kii jaanch ke radar par he

 He also did not rule out seeking bjp's support to form the new government
 uttar korea or america jis tarah har rose ek duusare ko dekh lene kii dhamkee de rahe hai, usase duniya par tisare vishwayuddh kaa khatra lagaataar mandara rahaa he
 The danger is even greater because North Korean dictator Marshal Kim Jong is said to have listened to them
 aise main agar kahin galati se bhi jang chhid gai to uskaa anjaam kya hoga, iskaa sahi-sahi andaaza lagaana bhi mushkil he
 But now the latest report prepared by a South Korean news agency Kijungko, only one line of it can make anyone's hair fall
 report ke mutabik dakshin korea or japan par hua pehla hamalaa hi ek jatke main 20 lakh se zyaada logon kii jaan le legaa
 2 million people will be killed, after Trump and Kim's blunt accents there is nothing left to hear
 bas yun samajhie ki barood ko chingaari kii der bhar he
 But the way these two leaders are calling each other bad, considering their hostility
 wo duniya ke liye yakeenan shubh sanket nahin he
 Because if a war started somewhere in this heat, it would be very difficult
 america se badhate tanaav ke bich agar kim jong un ne dakshin korea or japan par hamalaa kar diya to ek jatke main kareeb 20 lakh log jaan se haath dho baithenge
 Not only this, not a few thousand or a few lakhs will be injured in this attack, but about 70 lakh people will also be injured
 news agency kii report main khaufnak khulasasouth korean news agency yonhop ne ye daraane vaali report taiyaar kii he
 According to the agency's report, given the current strength of North Korea, it is feared that the conditions of war would be very deadly for the Korean Peninsula
 ye report aise vakt main saamne ai he jab america uttarkoria ke nazadik se bombar uda rahaa he or north korea japan ke upar se misile daag rahaa he
 The devastation will be terrible
 How much power is there now that no more matters remain
 kyonkiuttar koriabhi parmaanu bamon se las
 So the catastrophe is going to be catastrophic
 aise main duniya in donon netaaon ke bich madhyasthata kii koshish kar rahi he
 Former US President Jimmy Carter has called for the initiative
 jimi carter ne donon deshon kii talkhi dur karne ke liye trump prashasan kii taraf se uttar korea jane kii ichha jataai he
 Former President Jimmy Carter says that given the circumstances of the war, he can go to North Korea on behalf of the US administration
 unhone apane dost or trump ke suraksha salaahkaar leftinent general echaar macmaster se apni ichha jataai he
 But no positive response has been received yet
 pehle hamalaa kar saktaa he kim1977 se 1981 tak america ke raashtrapati rahe jimi carter ke mutabik kim jong un ke bare main kuch bhi andaja lagaana mushkil he
 If he suspects that America is going to do something big against North Korea, he will take a big step before that
 ye hamalaa parmaanu hamalaa bhi ho saktaa he
 Which could ruin American bases in South Korea, Japan and the Pacific
 isse pehle bhi carter bill clinton ke kaarykaal main pyongyang ja chuke hai
 He then tried to negotiate a settlement with Kim Il Sung, the then ruler of North Korea
 jo kim jong un ke dada the
 US strategy may be a failure, although there is little hope that Trump will send former US President Carter to North Korea for an administration agreement
 kyonki america ke liye kim jong un sidhe taur par khatra nahin he
 But Japan and South Korea may have to bear the brunt of its craze
 japan or dakshin korea kii tabaahi kaa matlab ye he ki purv asia main kai america thikaanon ko nuksaan uthaanaa padegaa or uskaa asar ye hoga ki china ko apane kabje main laane kii america ranneeti naakaam ho jaaegi
 The kimobserver Research Foundation, which will not back down from the attack, has also feared that North Korea may not have enough power to hit the US with its missiles in its entirety, but that it will certainly ruin Seoul and Japan
 aise main agar jang hoti he to tokyo hi nahin tseol bhi uttar korea ke nishane par hoga
 Let me tell you that Seoul is just 40 miles from North Korea
 jo uski range main aasaani se aayega
 North Korea has repeatedly said that if America takes any initiative, it will have to face serious consequences
 or wo apni mixilon se dakshin korea, japan or guam ko nishaanaa banane se peeche nahin hatega
 The Congress, which is taking a lot of power in coming out of defeat, left the post of party president in a hurry

 There is no possibility of the party winning the elections going to be held in Haryana and Maharashtra
 bharat ke purv videsh mantri, salmaan khurshid ne kaha ki na keval aagaamee rajya vidhansabha chunaav balki congress party kii haalat aise str par pahunch gai he ki yah apana bhavishya tak nahin tay kar sakati he

 kendriya mantri giriraaj singh ne ayodhya main ram mandir par adhyadesh laane ke maamle par patrakaron ko pratikriya vyakt karte hue kaha ki mughal kaal se hi hinduon kaa sirf dharm hi parivartan nahin karaayaa gaya balki hinduon ko khand-khand main baantne ke liye jaat-paat kii gandi oonchi raajnneeti kar shadyantr ke tahat tukade-tukade main kar diya
 Giriraj Singh said that after independence on the basis of religion, Nehru Gandhi family divided the country
 ab bache hue hinduon ko bhi jaat-paat ke naam par tukdon main baantne kii koshish vipakshiyon dwaara kii ja rahi he
 The Sant Samaj has expressed concern over the plight of India
 bihar ke gaya main sant samaaj dwaara dharm jaagran manch ke binar tale ayodhya main shri ram ke mandir nirmaan ke liye hinduon ko ekajute karne kaa aahvaan kiya he
 Mussulman Giriraj further said that Muslims should come forward to build the temple of Ram in Ayodhya
 hindustan ke dharm ke aadhaar par hue bantwaare ke baad pakistan main hinduon ko jabaran yaa to musalmaan bana diya gaya yaa phir hindu pakistan se palaayan kar gaye
 He said that temples have been demolished in Pakistan
 pakistan main hinduon kii ho rahi durdasha ke baavjood hindustan ne bharat main bache hue musalamaanon ko apane seene se laga kar rakhaa
 Today, Muslims of India will have to come forward to build Ram temple in Ayodhya
 kendriya mantri ne kaha ki aaj hindustan main musalmaan 3 se 33 pratishat ho gaye hai phir bhi hinduon kaa mandir hindustan ke aazaadee ke 72 saal baad bhi ayodhya , mathura , kaashi main ek mandir nahin ban sakaa he
 This is the misfortune of this country where leaders and courts have to face to build a temple in a country with a population of 100 crore Hindus
 ab bhi ayodhya main mandir nahin bana to 100 karod hinduon ke sabar kaa baandh tut jayega or agar aisa hua to desh ke liye bahut bura hoga
 Today, due to politicians doing politics of pseudo-secularism, questions are being raised on the construction of temples in the country
 ram mandir nahin bana to hinduon ke sabar kaa baandh tuutegasingh ne kaha ke 100 karod hindu kii aabaadi vaale is desh main ayodhya main ram mandir nahin bana to hinduon ke sabar kaa baandh tuutegaa or agar aisa hua to desh ke liye anjaam acha nahin hoga
 The leaders who do politics of caste and politics should leave small politics and come forward to strengthen the integrity of the nation
 aaj desh jis halaat se guzar rahaa he, iske liye nehru gandhi parivaar puri tarah doshi he
 Giriraj Singh further said that if the first Prime Minister of the country was Sardar Patel then today the country would not have this predicament
 sardaar patel ke samay main jaise somnath kaa mandir ban gaya tha usee tarah aaj kaashi, mathura or ayodhya main mandir ban gaya hota
 Today, people doing politics under the cover of religion in the country do not get a chance to do politics
 nehru kii galat nitiyon ke kaaran aaj desh kii yah durdasha he
 He said that only Muslim brothers have to come forward
 ayodhya main mandir nirmaan ke liye agar vah aage nahin aae to hinduon ke sabar kaa baandh tuutegaa or agar aisa hua to desh ke liye anjaam acha nahin hoga
 Sant Samaj of India is determined to build the temple
 sant samaaj nyaayalay or rajanetaaon ke nirnay kii ore nahin dekhegaa
 Farooq Abdullah says that the temple can be built anywhere

 This is not possible under any circumstances even for Hindus

 The Babri Masjid is being opposed by the spiritual guru Sri Sri Ravi Shankar for mediation on the one hand, and on the other, all the BJP leaders are considering it as a big effort
 kendriya mantri or bihar se bijepi ke netaa giriraaj singh ne shri shri dwaara kii ja rahi madhyasthata ko lekar ummid jataai he ki isse ram mandir banane kaa rasta aasaan ho jayega
 Talking to this day, Giriraj Singh gave rise to a new controversy and said that Mussalman is not a descendant of Ram but of Babar
 isliye mandir banane ke liye hindu or musalmaan donon saath aaenge
 Giriraj Singh, who arrived at the inauguration of the water blades set up at the Trade Fair by his ministry at Pragati Maidan, said in a conversation with Aaj Tak that the descendants of both Hindus and Muslims are Shri Ram
 giriraaj singh ne shri shri dwaara shuru kii gai pahal ke virodh main aawaaj uthaane vaale logon par bayaan dete hue kaha ki, jo log madhyasthata par sawaal uthaa rahe hai vah log nahin chaahate kiraam mandirbane
 Those people are making a gap in the society
 " giriraaj singh kaa kahana he ki jab court ne kaha he ki aapas main miljul kar maamla sulajhaa len to koi na koi to madhyasthata karegaa hi
 Sri Sri Ravi Shankar is a cultural yoga guru and spiritual teacher to date
 mujhe puraa vishwaas he ki shri shri ravishankar sahi madhyasthata karenge
 On the issue of Ram temple, BJP leader Giriraj Singh said that Sri Sri Ravi Shankar will succeed in his mission and Ram temple will definitely be built
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne kaha he ki bharat main aatankwaad baahar se aa rahaa he
 He also said that the Muslims of our country will not allow the plans of Al Qaeda to succeed
 unhone kaha ki desh ke musalamaanon par shaq nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Before leaving for Washington, Modi said at the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) that India wants friendship with neighboring countries
 unhone bharat main aatank ko aaayaatit qaraar diya or kaha ki bharat ke musalmaan alqaida ko fail kar denge
 Modi said, 'you must have seen that the nature of terrorism in India does not originate from its soil but it has been exported
 ' bharat main al-kaayda kii shakhaaen khole jane se jude sawaalon ke jawaab main unhone kaha ki bharat bhagwaan buddha or mahatma gandhi kaa desh he or uske naagarik kabhi aatankwaad kaa saath nahin de sakate
 Modi said that political gain from terrorism cannot be fought without harm and to defeat it, the whole world has to be united on the basis of humanity, rising above the nation, caste, religion
 unhone kaha, 'aatankwaad kii koi seemaa nahin hoti he
 Terrorism is a perversion that is beyond imagination
 'pradhanmantri ne is baat par khed prakat kiya ki duniya ke bahut se desh aatankwaad ke ghinaune rup ko kabhi samaj nahin paae
 Modi said that he had come to America in 1993 and he had a talk with the officials here, but at that time he called it not terrorism but law and order problem
 unhone kaha ki lekin baad main jab main yahaan aayaa to ve mujhe samajha rahe the ki aatankwaad kya hota he kyonki tab yahaan 9-11 kii ghatana ho gai thi yani jab tak hamaare yahaan bam nahin girtaa, ham aatankwaad ko nahin samajhate
 The Prime Minister said that we have paid terrorism for 40 years and warned the world that there is no border and country of terrorism
 or yah kab kahaan aa dhamkegaa, kisi ko pataa nahin hota
 Such distortion would not have been imagined when journalists were being strangled
 modi ne kaha ki aatankwaad se ladane ke saadhan chaahe jo bhi hon, usase ladane kaa rasta ek hi he or vah he maanavtaa main vishwaas
 He said that the world will have to fight shoulder to shoulder with this evil for the welfare of all
 pashchim asia kaa ullekh karte hue modi ne kaha ki yah kshetra kabhi itani teji se aage bad rahaa tha, lekin aaj vahaan kisi haalat ho gai he
 Emphasizing on promoting tourism to fight terrorism, he said, 'tourism connects and distributes terrorism
 isliye main paryaton ko badhaava dena chahta hum
 He also said that negotiations are going on on the india-china border dispute
 isse pehle pradhanmantri ne daawa kiya ki unki sarkaar ne bharat main bijness karne kaa maahaul banaaya he
 Modi also referred to changes in the budget for FDI in India

 i wanted to run away from that misery and that's what i did
 unhone aage kaha, main papa ke nidhan ke chaar din baad hi kaam par laut ai, kyonki ek to mere pita ko meraa ghar par khaali baithna pasand nahin tha, doosraa agar main aisa karti to pagal ho gai hoti

 BJP MP and former Home Secretary RK Singh on Friday put the party and government in an uncomfortable position when he was speaking on Jammu and Kashmir during the Zero Hour
 singh ne is dauraan apni hi sarkaar kii niti par sawaal uthaate hue kaha ki rashtravirohi takaton ke khilaaf karrwai nahin ho rahi he, jabaki pehle aisi takaton ke khilaaf karrwai hoti thi
 During the Zero Hour in the Lok Sabha, MP RK Singh asked while speaking on the Kashmir issue, 'pakistani flags are being waved in Kashmir
 vahaan kii sthiti thik nahin he
 Anti-national forces are raising their voice
 lekin mahabuuba sarkaar unke khilaaf koi karrwai nahin kar rahi

 RK Singh said that earlier such incidents were less, because then there was action against them

 However, this is not the first time that RK Singh has questioned his own government
 isse pehle bhi vah kai baar apni hi party or sarkaar par nishaanaa saadh chuke hai
 There will be no agreement on prohibition of liquor in Bihar
 yah kahana he mukhyamantri nitish kumaar kaa, jo shanivaar ko tad ke ped se nira or anya samagriyon se sambandhit ek kaaryshaala ko sambodhit kar rahe the
 Nitish also said on the recent death of 18 people by drinking poisonous liquor in Gopalganj, that the argument is wrong that all this is happening due to the ban on liquor in Bihar, because when the ban on sale of domestic and foreign liquor in Bihar is banned
 There was no such incident even then and in Uttar Pradesh last month many people died due to drinking poisonous liquor
 lekin nitish ne daawa kiya ki is mudde par unke khilaaf chal rahe abhiyaan se unke upar koi asar nahin hone vaala he
 The comments pichley maheene bihar vidhaan mandal ke donon sadanon se paarit nae utpaada bill ke prabandhan kii charchaa karte hue nitish ne kaha ki jo pine pilaane vaale hai wo koi na koi bahaanaa dhundhakar unki aalochana karte rahete hai, lekin gaanv ke logon ke chehre par jo muskuraahat waapas ai he, use khatm nahin kar sakate hai
 The Governor has not given his consent to this new excise bill at present
 gopalganj main sharaab cond ke baad sthaneey prashasan ne tad ke pedo ko jabt kiya he or un jabt pedo kii nigaraanee main homeguard ke jawan lagaae hai
 Nitish, while discussing about the motivation for prohibiting liquor or his perception of alcohol changed on Saturday, said that when he was a student at Patna's engineering college, he used to live in a Krishna lodge in Mussallapur area of the city
 vahaan har maheene ke pehle hafte main aas paas ke ilaake main sharaab pine ke baad log itnaa hangaamaa or gali galouj karte the ki unako sharaab ke prati nafrat ho gai
 But speaking on his criticism for bringing liquor from door to door, Nitish said that when his government came, the entire purchase and sale of liquor was arranged which increased the revenue so much
 nitish ne gopalganj main haal hi main jahrili sharaab pine se 18 logon kii maut par bhi kaha ki ye tark galat he ki bihar main sharaab par pabandi lagane ke kaaran ye sab ho rahaa he, kyonki jab bihar main desi or videshi sharaab kii bikri par pratibandh nahin tha, tab bhi aisi ghatana hoti thi or uttar pradesh main pichley maheene jahrili sharaab pine se kai logon kii maut hui thi
 But Nitish claimed that the ongoing campaign against him on this issue is not going to affect him
 tippaniyan Referring to the management of the new excise bill passed by both houses of Bihar Legislature last month, Nitish said that those who are drinking, keep on criticizing them by finding some excuse, but the smile back on the face of the people of the village Has come, we cannot finish it
 filhal is nae utpaada bill ko rajyapal ne apni sahmati nahin di he
 After the liquor carnage in Gopalganj, the local administration has seized the palm trees and has put homeguard jawans under surveillance of those seized trees
 nitish ne shanivaar ko sharabbandi lagane kii prerana yaa sharaab ke prati unki dharna kyon badali, uske bare main charchaa karte hue kaha ki jab wo patna ke ejineering college main chaatr the tab shahar ke musallahpur ilaake main ek krishna loj main rahaa karte the
 In the first week of every month, after drinking liquor in the surrounding area, people used to make so much ruckus and street hawks that they hated alcohol
 lekin sharaab ko ghar ghar tak pahunchane ke liye apni aalochana par bolte hue nitish ne kaha ki unki sarkaar jab aayi tab sharaab kii puri kharid bikri ko vyavasthti kiya gaya jisase rajasav main itani vruddhi aayi

 apane bayanon ke liye vivaadon main rahane vaale uttar pradesh ke varisht mantri ajam khan ne ab rape peedita ko lekar ek vivaadit bayaan diya he jis par unki kaaphi aalochana ho rahi he
 Azam Khan told the victim from the stage itself, 'she will get fame due to the complaint of slander but what she will show to the world
 'ajam khankanpur main ek kaarykram main shaamil hone pahunche the
 During this time, the rape victim was trying to meet him, which caused a bit of chaos
 ajam ne manch se hi peedita par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha, 'mujhe is bahan kaa maamla nahin pataa he vah gambhir maamla hi hoga lekin unhone jo hangaamaa kiya he usase unako shoharat mil gai he agar badanaami se shoharat legi to aage munh kaise dikhaaegi
 Actually, the rape victim came here with a female lawyer and wanted to meet Azam Khan and complain but the organizers of the event stopped her
 is par kaarykram main thodaa hangaamaa hua
 Angered by this, Azam targeted the woman who was suffering from the stage itself
 unhone kaha ki jin bahanon ne avyavashtha failaai he unhen yahaan se shoharat jarur mil gai he
 Not only this, Azam also said that his complaint is a complaint of slander

 The victim said that the police has registered only a case of molestation in this case
 doshiyon par karrwai kii maang karne kii guhaar lekar vah ajam khan ke paas pahunchi thi
 If seen, the biggest rise in the political arena of the country in 2018 has come in the political career of Congress President Rahul Gandhi
 ek ke baad ek lagaataar chunaav main haar ke baad 2018 main rahul gandhi ke haath kai safalataa lagi
 Modi's home pitch is a tough challenge in Gujarat and then the political stakes of Karnataka and by the end of the year the Congress coronation in three big states of North India, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan has raised a hope among the party supporters
 lekin ab saal nayaa he or chunautiyaan bhi usase badi he
 With the start of the year, the battlefield of 2019 has been decorated, where the direct contest is Modi vs Rahul
 sabase badi siyaasi jangcongress party pehali baar rahul gandhi ke netritv main loksabhaa chunaav ke siyaasi ran main utregi
 2019 is going to be a decisive year for Rahul Gandhi, as for Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main modi lahar congress kaa puri tarah se safaya ho gaya he
 The Congress could not win so many mps that it could also get the chair of the opposition
 kareeb teen dashak se congress party bijepi kii ek khaas tarah kii raajnneeti se muqabla kar rahi he
 Although the Congress was in power many times during this period, but the most important thing is that it could not form a government on its own
 modi ke satta main aane ke baad ek ke baad ek rajya haath se khiskate gaye
 From the Ram Mandir movement of 1990 to the Modi wave of 2014 and then by 2019, the Congress has to fight the BJP
 haalanki, rahul gandhi ke haathon main party kii kaman aane ke baad unhone soft hindutv kii raah ko apanaaya he
 Despite this, all the merits of the return of the Congress in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections are on Rahul's shoulders
 vipaksh ko ekajute karne kii chunauticongress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ke liye sabase badi chunauti vipaksh ko jodakar rakhane kii he
 Recently, under the leadership of Rahul, the Congress has also won three states, which will surely boost their spirits
 lekin bijepi ko 2019 main maat dena itnaa bhi aasaan nahin he
 This is the reason why Rahul is constantly talking about opposition unity, but parties like BSP, SP TMC are still not ready to join him
 iske alaava kesiar gaiyr- congress or gaiyr- bijepi dalon kaa gathbandhan banane main jute hai
 Amidst all this, the biggest challenge for Rahul is to bring the opposition in his name
 haalanki, rahul gandhi khulkar kah chuke hai ki wo pradhanmantri banane ke liye taiyaar hai
 But in the Grand Alliance, there is no consensus on his name either
 aise main unke piem banane kaa sapana tabhi puraa ho saktaa he, jab congress purna bahumat se sarkaar banaae yaa congress ke paas itani siten hon ki anya vipakshi partiyon ke paas sarkaar banane ke liye congress kaa samarthan karne ke sivaa koi rasta na bache
 In such a situation, Rahul will have a real test of politics in 2019

 unheen main se ek aisa naam he, jiskaa zikr bhale hi naa hota ho, lekin desh kii aazaadee ke liye sabase kam umr kaa ye baccha faansee chadh gaya tha

 In 1905, he also participated actively in the movement against the partition of Bengal (bang-bhang)

 Rahul Gandhi has not given clarification on this allegation

 In the 2014 BJP manifesto, Rahul Gandhi mentioned the promise of OROP
 19 april 2014 ko congress party ke ek twit main kaha gaya ki 'menifesto main unhone (bijepi ne) likhaa he, ham van rank van pension karenge

 In this, he told them that the Congress-led government would fulfill all promises on the issue of One Rank One Pension
 yahaan yah bataanaa jaruri he ki sirf rahul gandhi hi aisi gadabadiyaan nahin karte hai
 Many speeches by Prime Minister Narendra Modi have also recorded historical and factual mistakes about which have been written from time to time
 piem modi ke bhaashanon main bhi kai baar aisa hua jab unki jubaan fisali
 Let's take a look at similar mistakes- - piem banane se pehle unhone kaha ki 1947 main ek rupaya ek dollar ke baraabar tha
 Whereas the reality is that then the rupee was compared to the pound and the value of one rupee was thirty cents
 - ek baar unhone galati se mahatma gandhi ko mohandas kii jagah mohanlal karamchand gandhi kah diya tha
 - Instead of the Red Fort, the Red Door had come out of their mouths
 unhone kaha tha ki piem 15 agast ko laal daravaaje se bhaashan dete hai
 During the campaign, he had said that these are the elections to the 14th Lok Sabha
 phir kisi ko tokane par unhone kaha ki 16veen loksabhaa ke chunaav hai
 - He said that when we talk of Gupta dynasty, we remember Chandragupta's politics

 Yes, Chandragupta II was definitely in the Gupta dynasty

 But neither Shivraj Singh Chauhan nor his son Karthikeya are satisfied with this cleanliness
 kartikeya ne manahani kaa daawa kar diya
 His lawyer has cited newspaper cutting and TV news clipping as evidence
 3 november ko is maamle kii sunwaayee hogi
 Karthikeya said that it is okay that Rahul Gandhi gave clarification
 lekin unhone saarvajanik manch se unke or unke parivaar ke bare main galat baaten kahin
 It is therefore claimed
 idhar, shivaraj singh chouhan rajya vidhansabha main tikaton ke bantwaare par charchaa ke liye dilli pahunch gaye hai
 Here he met Amit Shah
 saath hi kaha ki rahul gandhi ne unka apmaan kiya he
 On the other hand, Rahul Gandhi's attacks on Shivraj Singh Chauhan are continuing
 unhone aaj madhya pradesh main kaha ki jitne mukademe karnaa hai kar len, vyapam ghotaale se dhyaan nahin bhatka sakate
 But this story of Rahul Gandhi's tongue slipping has definitely come up for discussion
 aisa isliye bhi he kyonki isi maheene ek ke baad ek aisi kai ghatnaayen hui hai
 One such incident happened on Monday when Rahul Gandhi wrote Mizoram to Manipur in his Facebook post
 iske baad unki jabardast aalochana hui
 This is also a problem for the Congress because elections are still going on in Mizoram and there is a Congress government there
 darasal, rahul gandhi ne mizoram ke us sainik skool ke bare main story saajha kii thi jisane pachaas saal baad apane daravaaje ladakiyon ke liye khole hai
 But accidentally wrote Manipur instead of Mizoram
 baad main us post ko hataa diya gaya
 Correct information was added to the new post
 rahul kii galatiyon kaa silsilaa yaheen nahin thama
 He alleged at an election meeting in Madhya Pradesh this month that Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had met Nirav Modi in Parliament
 iske baad neerav modi desh chhod kar bhaag gaya
 But Rahul also made a mistake here
 neerav modi na to kabhi sansad aayaa or na hi kabhi arun jetali se uski mulaakaat hui
 Rahul might have wanted to mention Vijay Mallya
 jiske bare main vitt mantri ne kaha tha ki usne apane saansad hone kaa durupyog karte hue sansad bhawan main unase milane kii koshish kii thi lekin unhone usko jhaad diya tha
 On Rahul's latest allegation, Jaitley wrote on Facebook that "I do not remember if i ever saw Nirav Modi
" sansad bhawan main usase milane kaa to sawaal hi nahin uthta
 Like Rahul is claiming that if Nirav Modi comes to Parliament, it will be mentioned in the reception record of Parliament House
 kya rahul yah maanate hai ki agar ek jhooth baar-baar bolaa jaye to khud ko uske sach hone kaa yakeen ho jaataa he
 Or is it a case of a clown prince
 rahul gandhi ne is aarope par safai nahin di he
 Another issue of Rahul Gandhi's mess is the one rank one pension for army officers and jawans
 2014 main bijepi ke ghoshnaptr main oropi kaa vaada karne kaa rahul gandhi ne zikr kiya tha
 On 19 April 2014, a tweet from the Congress party said that in the manifesto, he (BJP) has written, We will do one rank one pension
 oropi ho gaya he, hamane kar diya he: rahul gandhi
 But this Saturday, Rahul Gandhi met a delegation of ex-servicemen
 isamen unhone unhen kaha ki congress kii aguwai vaali sarkaar van rank van pension ke mudde par sabhi vaadon ko puraa karegi
 It is necessary to state here that only Rahul Gandhi does not commit such messes
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ke kai bhaashanon main bhi aitihaasik or tathyaatmak galtiyaan darj kii gai hai jinke bare main samay samay par likhaa gaya he
 PM Modi's speeches also happened many times when his tongue slipped
 aisi hi galatiyon par ek nazar daal lete hai- Before becoming PM, he said that in 1947 one rupee was worth one dollar
 jabaki hakeekat yah he ki tab rupee kii tulana pound se hoti thi or ek rupye kaa mulya tees saint tha
 - He once mistakenly called Mahatma Gandhi as Mohanlal Karamchand Gandhi instead of Mohandas
 - unke munh se laal kile kii jagah laal darwaja nikal gaya tha
 He had said that PM gives speeches through the red door on 15 August
 - prachaar ke dauraan unhone kah diya tha ki ye 14veen loksabhaa ke chunaav hai
 Then when someone interrupted, he said that there are elections to the 16th Lok Sabha
 - unhone kaha jab ham gupt vansh kii baat karte hai to chandragupta kii raajnneeti kii yaad aati he
 But Chandragupta belonged to the Maurya dynasty
 haa chandragupta dwitiya gupt vansh main jarur hue the
 - In the place of freedom fighter Shyamji Krishna Verma, PM Modi was sitting referring to Shyama Prasad Mukherjee
 - daos main unhone kah diya tha ki chah sau karod bharatiyon ne ek party kii sarkaar ko chunaa
 So these are mistakes that often occur during election campaigning
 madhya pradesh kii hi baat karen to abhi congress ke do netaaon ke bhaashanon main hui galatiyon ne surkhiyaan batori hai
 One speech is by Congress MP Kantilal Bhuria
 bhuriyaji rahul gandhi or rajeev gandhi main gadabadi kar baithe
 Well, when he was interrupted he also cured himself
 aise hi ek duusare netaa jitu patawaari bhi surkhiyaan bator chuke hai jab unhone kaha tha party gai tel lene
 But due to his slippery tongue, Rahul Gandhi has got caught in the legal bet

 kartikeya ne kaha ki yah thik he ki rahul gandhi ne safai di
 But he told wrong things about him and his family from a public forum
 isliye daawa kiya he
 Here, Shivraj Singh Chauhan has reached Delhi to discuss the distribution of tickets in the state assembly
 yahaan unhone amit shah se mulaakaat kii
 He also said that Rahul Gandhi has insulted him
 udhar, rahul gandhi ke shivaraj singh chouhan par hamale jari hai
 He said in Madhya Pradesh today that as many prosecutions have to be done, one cannot divert attention from the Vyapam scam
 lekin rahul gandhi kii jubaan phisalane kaa yah kissa charchaa main jarur aa gaya he
 This is also because many such incidents have happened one after another in the same month
 aisa hi ek vakya somvaar ko hi hua jab rahul gandhi ne apane fasebuk post main mizoram ko manipur likh daalaa
 After this he received a lot of criticism
 yah congress ke liye pareshaani main daalane vaali baat bhi he kyonki mizoram main bhi abhi chunaav ho rahaa he or vahaan congress kii sarkaar he
 In fact, Rahul Gandhi shared a story about the military school in Mizoram which has opened its doors to girls after fifty years
 lekin galati se mizoram kii jagah manipur likh daalaa
 That post was later deleted
 nai post main sahi jaankaree daali gai
 The process of Rahul's mistakes did not stop here
 unhone isi maheene madhya pradesh main chunavi sabha main aarope lagaaya ki vitt mantri arun jetali ne sansad main neerav modi se mulaakaat kii thi
 After this Nirav Modi left the country and fled
 lekin rahul yahaan bhi galati kar baithe
 Nirav Modi neither came to Parliament nor did he ever meet Arun Jaitley

 Rahul Gandhi has not given clarification on this allegation
 rahul gandhi kii gadabadi kaa ek or mudda sena afasaron or javaanon ke liye van rank van pension yani oropi kaa he
 In the 2014 BJP manifesto, Rahul Gandhi mentioned the promise of OROP
 19 april 2014 ko congress party ke ek twit main kaha gaya ki 'menifesto main unhone (bijepi ne) likhaa he, ham van rank van pension karenge
 OROP is done, we have done it: Rahul Gandhi

 On the other hand, Rahul Gandhi's attacks on Shivraj Singh Chauhan are continuing
 unhone aaj madhya pradesh main kaha ki jitne mukademe karnaa hai kar len, vyapam ghotaale se dhyaan nahin bhatka sakate
 But this story of Rahul Gandhi's tongue slipping has definitely come up for discussion
 aisa isliye bhi he kyonki isi maheene ek ke baad ek aisi kai ghatnaayen hui hai
 One such incident happened on Monday when Rahul Gandhi wrote Mizoram to Manipur in his Facebook post
 iske baad unki jabardast aalochana hui
 This is also a problem for the Congress because elections are still going on in Mizoram and there is a Congress government there
 darasal, rahul gandhi ne mizoram ke us sainik skool ke bare main story saajha kii thi jisane pachaas saal baad apane daravaaje ladakiyon ke liye khole hai
 But accidentally wrote Manipur instead of Mizoram
 baad main us post ko hataa diya gaya
 Correct information was added to the new post
 rahul kii galatiyon kaa silsilaa yaheen nahin thama
 He alleged at an election meeting in Madhya Pradesh this month that Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had met Nirav Modi in Parliament
 iske baad neerav modi desh chhod kar bhaag gaya
 But Rahul also made a mistake here
 neerav modi na to kabhi sansad aayaa or na hi kabhi arun jetali se uski mulaakaat hui
 Rahul might have wanted to mention Vijay Mallya
 jiske bare main vitt mantri ne kaha tha ki usne apane saansad hone kaa durupyog karte hue sansad bhawan main unase milane kii koshish kii thi lekin unhone usko jhaad diya tha
 On Rahul's latest allegation, Jaitley wrote on Facebook that "I do not remember if i ever saw Nirav Modi
" sansad bhawan main usase milane kaa to sawaal hi nahin uthta
 Like Rahul is claiming that if Nirav Modi comes to Parliament, it will be mentioned in the reception record of Parliament House
 kya rahul yah maanate hai ki agar ek jhooth baar-baar bolaa jaye to khud ko uske sach hone kaa yakeen ho jaataa he
 Or is it a case of a clown prince
 rahul gandhi ne is aarope par safai nahin di he
 Another issue of Rahul Gandhi's mess is the one rank one pension for army officers and jawans
 2014 main bijepi ke ghoshnaptr main oropi kaa vaada karne kaa rahul gandhi ne zikr kiya tha
 On 19 April 2014, a tweet from the Congress party said that in the manifesto, he (BJP) has written, We will do one rank one pension
 oropi ho gaya he, hamane kar diya he: rahul gandhi
 But this Saturday, Rahul Gandhi met a delegation of ex-servicemen
 isamen unhone unhen kaha ki congress kii aguwai vaali sarkaar van rank van pension ke mudde par sabhi vaadon ko puraa karegi
 It is necessary to state here that only Rahul Gandhi does not commit such messes
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ke kai bhaashanon main bhi aitihaasik or tathyaatmak galtiyaan darj kii gai hai jinke bare main samay samay par likhaa gaya he
 PM Modi's speeches also happened many times when his tongue slipped
 aisi hi galatiyon par ek nazar daal lete hai- Before becoming PM, he said that in 1947 one rupee was worth one dollar
 jabaki hakeekat yah he ki tab rupee kii tulana pound se hoti thi or ek rupye kaa mulya tees saint tha
 - He once mistakenly called Mahatma Gandhi as Mohanlal Karamchand Gandhi instead of Mohandas
 - unke munh se laal kile kii jagah laal darwaja nikal gaya tha
 He had said that PM gives speeches through the red door on 15 August
 - prachaar ke dauraan unhone kah diya tha ki ye 14veen loksabhaa ke chunaav hai
 Then when someone interrupted, he said that there are elections to the 16th Lok Sabha
 - unhone kaha jab ham gupt vansh kii baat karte hai to chandragupta kii raajnneeti kii yaad aati he
 But Chandragupta belonged to the Maurya dynasty
 haa chandragupta dwitiya gupt vansh main jarur hue the
 - In the place of freedom fighter Shyamji Krishna Verma, PM Modi was sitting referring to Shyama Prasad Mukherjee
 - daos main unhone kah diya tha ki chah sau karod bharatiyon ne ek party kii sarkaar ko chunaa
 So these are mistakes that often occur during election campaigning
 madhya pradesh kii hi baat karen to abhi congress ke do netaaon ke bhaashanon main hui galatiyon ne surkhiyaan batori hai
 One speech is by Congress MP Kantilal Bhuria
 bhuriyaji rahul gandhi or rajeev gandhi main gadabadi kar baithe
 Well, when he was interrupted he also cured himself
 aise hi ek duusare netaa jitu patawaari bhi surkhiyaan bator chuke hai jab unhone kaha tha party gai tel lene
 But due to his slippery tongue, Rahul Gandhi has got caught in the legal bet

 In Tamil Nadu, there is a fierce battle within the AIADMK for power
 ediemke mahasachiv shashikala ne guuruuvaar shaam rajyapal si vidyasagar raav se mulaakaat kar sarkaar banane kaa daawa pesh kiya
 However, Panneerselvam on the other hand is also claiming to have mlas with him
 is bich supreme court ne shashikala ko shapath lene se rokane kii yachika par turant sunwaayee se inkaar kar diya he
 Meanwhile, Sasikala has also sacked the party's presidium chairman Madhusudhanan from the party
 shashikala gut ke 15 vidhayak diemke ke sampark menis bich, sutron ke hawaale se khabar mili he ki pichley 48 ghante main shashikala gut ke 15 vidhayakon ne diemke sambhaavnaaen talashne ke liye sampark kiya he
 These mlas believe that both Sasikala and Panneerselvam will not be able to prove a majority so the DMK should explore the possibilities
 haalanki, sutara bataa rahe hai ki stallin diemke kii sarkaar banane ke paksh main nahin hai kyonki isse ediemke main tut ke liye diemke ko jimmedaar samajha jayega
 Stalin will wait for AIADMK to break up by himself
 kya shashikala gut ne congress se saadhaa nishaanaa?baaki dalon kii bhi pratikriyaayein saamne aa rahi hai
 The Congress has made it clear that it is with the DMK and there is no question of supporting Sasikala
 isse ye bhi kayaas lagaae ja rahe hai ki kya shashikala gut ne congress ne samarthan ke liye sampark saadhaa tha
 While the Sasikala faction claims that more than 130 mlas are with her
 isse ye bhi sawaal uth rahaa he ki kya shashikala gut se AIADMK vidhayak khiskkar panniraselvam kii taraf aa rahe hai
 AIADMK has a total of 135 mlas in the 234-member Assembly of Sasikala faction
 aisi khabaren aa rahi hai vidhayak kaaryakari siem o panniraselvam kheme kaa bhi rukh kar rahe hai
 However, during a meeting with Tamil Nadu Governor c Vidyasagar Rao on Thursday, Sasikala has claimed the support of 129 mlas
 swami ne kiya shashikala kaa samarthanis bich, bijepi netaa subramanyam swami ne kaha he ki rajyapal ko shashikala ko bahumat sabit karne kaa mauka milanaa chahie
 Swamy said that Sasikala has handed over the list of mlas to the Governor
 unke paas bahumat he
 The governor should give them a chance to prove their majority in the assembly
 panniraselvam kaa aarope-vidhayak bandi banaae gaepanniraselvam gut ne in daavon kaa khaarij karte hue shashikala ko kareeb 100 vidhayakon ke samarthan kii baat kahi he
 Panneerselvam also claims that he will prove a majority if the governor gives him a chance
 haalanki abhi unke saath keval 5 vidhayak hai
 He has alleged that party mlas have been held hostage at the Golden Bay Resort on East Coast Road and are sitting on hunger strike
 paneerselvam ko samarthan kii peshkash nahin: dmkisa bich, diemke ke kaaryakari adhyaksh em ke stallin ne is baat se inkaar kiya ki unki party ne o paneerselvam ko samarthan kii peshkash kii he
 Stalin stressed that an appropriate decision would be made at the right time
 stallin ne apni party kii ek up mahasachiv subbulakshmi jagadishan kii ore se vyakt kiye gaye is vichaar se party ko alag kiya ki dramuk paneerselvam ko bina shart samarthan kii peshkash karegaa
 Stalin said- DMK does not agree with his view
 party kii ore se jari ek bayaan main kaha gaya he ki keval party adhyaksh em karunanidhi or mahasachiv ke anbajhagan sahi samay par ek uchit nirnay karenge
 The present situation in Tamil Nadu is extraordinary
 stallin ne kaha ki aisi paristhitiyon main party line kaa nirnay mashvire ke baad sheersh netritv dwaara kiya jayega

 bijepi netaa nalin kohli ne kaha ki gauri lankesh kii hatya ko lekar jo log pradhanmantri narendra modi par sawaal uthaa rahe hai, unhen karnataka sarkaar, karnataka police or congress se sawaal poochna chahie
 The BJP leader said, 'I think they know very well that they will not be highlighted when they ask questions to the Karnataka government and the Congress
 pradhanmantri modi se sawaal poochne par ve zyada hilite honge
 "if you want to do politics, then do politics openly", Nalin said that the statement he has made on UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath
 usase lagata he ki wo raajnneeti karnaa chaahate hai
 If they want to do politics, then why are they doing politics by resorting to awards
 aword vaapis karke wo puraskaar kaa apmaan kar rahe hai
 This is not right
 agar unhen raajnneeti kerani he to khulkar raajnneeti karen
 It is wrong to do politics under the guise of awards

 But Mukhtar himself started on the path of crime
 40 se zyada mukademen sir par liye wo pichley 13 saalon se jail main band he
 The number of prosecutions are as many enemies
 mukhtaar ke khilaaf 40 se zyada sangeen maamleupi ke mau kii kahani bhi bahut ajeeb he
 Who is his MLA since last 5 times
 wo pichley 13 saalon se jail main hi band he
 More than 40 cases have been filed against Mukhtar Ansari on charges of dozens of serious incidents like murder, kidnapping and extortion
 phir bhi dabangai itani he ki jail main rahete hue bhi na sirf chunaav jitate hai balki apane gang ko bhi chalaate hai

 saath hi jail main rahete hue bijepi netaa krishnanand raay kii 7 saathiyon samet hatya kaa ilzaam bhi ansaari ke maathe par laga
 Mukhtar surrendered before the Ghazipur police in the case of inciting a riot in Dabadbamau, which is maintained in Purvanchal
 or tabhi se wo jail main band hai
 First he was kept in Ghazipur jail
 phir vahaan se mathura jail bheja gaya
 Then Mathura was sent to Agra Jail and Agra to Banda Jail
 uske baad se ajtak mukhtaar ko baahar aana naseeb nahin hua
 But still he dominates in Purvanchal
 wo jail main rahakar bhi chunaav jitate rahe
 Ansari is the owner of Robinhood Farming, Mining, Scrap, Liquor, Railway Contracting for the poor
 jiske dam par usne apni sultanate khadi kii
 But if this robinhood robs the rich, it also distributes it among the poor
 aisa mau ke log kehete hai ki sirf dabangai hi nahin balki bataur vidhayak mukhtaar ansaari ne apane ilaake main kaaphi kaam kiya he
 This Robinhood spends 20 times more money than its MLA funds on roads, bridges, hospitals and school-colleges
 parivaar kaa gauravshaalee itihassirf dar kii vajah se nahin balki kaam kii vajah se bhi ilaake ke garib gurbon main mukhtaar ansaari ke parivaar kaa sammaan he
 But perhaps few of you know that there is another reason for this honor of the Ansari family in Mau and that is the glorious history of this family

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi's parliamentary constituency, Jayapur village in Varanasi, is competing with semi-government, private institutions and corporate houses
 is hode main kai chije jameen par nazar bhi aane lagi hai jinamein sadak, solar lit, musaharon ke liye ghar, anganbari, skool aadi
 Toilets also became the most important link of the Prime Minister's cleanliness campaign
 lekin yahi kadi sabase kamjor sabit ho rahi he
 Around 400 toilets have been built but most are not working and many have been broken
 pradhanmantri ke adarsh gaanv jayapur main bane in shauchalay main shouch karne ke liye camod ke saath ek urinal bhi he
 a tank is also built in the side for the water to come with water for washing hands
 par gaur se dekhenge to isamen pipe ke conection kii jagah to bani he par pani kaa conection nahin hai
 Therefore, for the villagers without water, it is proving to be useless
 gaanv ke ramjit verma se jab in tailet ke bare main poocha to foran bole ki "ye jo toilet bana he keval khadaa kar diya gaya he isamen jal kii vyavastha nahin he
 When small children go, they cannot carry water, so there is a lot of dirt in them
 isame pani ki kami he isliye log nahin jate
 Not only water, it has many other drawbacks
 jaise shauchalay to bana diya gaya par mel jane ke liye jo gaddha banaaya gaya he usame dhakkan hi nahin bana
 And the pits are also built just five by five feet
 lihaaja gaanv vaale ise shouch ke liye to nahin yuj kar rahe par dabba khadaa he lihaaja barsaat se apane conde (upale) kii hi raksha kar rahe hai usame rakh kar
 Because in their eyes, these toilets are of no use
 gaanv waalon kii ye bhaavana rajkumaar bakhubi bayaan karte hai " sar ye letrin jo bana ye bahut bekaar bana he koi upyog karne laayak nahin he agar upyog karnaa he to do kii jagah ek hi banaaie
 Some people said that these toilets made of fiber and tin are just standing on the ground
 lihaaja tej aandhi main kai inamen se gir bhi gaye the
 Which were later erected
 tippaniyan The village headman says that only a few toilets are defective and they have been reported to the executive body
 or un logon ne survey karakar ise thik karne kaa aashwaasan bhi he
 There are many good things here, including roads, solar lights, bus stands, Anganwadi rooms, girls' small school and Atal Nagar for Mushars, in which about ten houses are built

 sirf pani hi nahin isamen or bhi kai kamiyaan he
 For example, toilets have been made, but there is no lid in the pit that has been made for defecation
 or gadde bhi sirf paanch paanch foot ke banaae gaye hai
 So the villagers are not using it for defecation but the container is standing, so they are protecting their kande (uplea) from the rain by keeping it in it
 kyonki unki nigaah main ye shauchalay kisi kaam ke nahin
 This feeling of the villagers Rajkumar is very well narrated, "sir, this letrine which has been made very useless is not worth any use
 If you want to use, make one instead of two
 kuch logon ne bataaya ki fibre or tin se bane ye shauchalay jameen par bas khadey hi hai
 So many of them fell in the strong storm
 jinhen baad main khadaa kiya gaya
 The comments gaanv ke pradhan kehete hai ki kuch hi shauchalay kharaab hai or unki shikaayat kaarydaayi sanstha se kar di gai he
 And they have also assured to fix it by conducting a survey
 yahaan par kai chije acchhee bhi bani he jiname sadak, solar lit, bas stand, anganbari ke kamare, ladakiyon kaa chota skool or musaharon ke liye atal nagar jiname takreeban das makaan bane he

 'identity', an NGO trying to identify children from poor neighborhoods, is an initiative of some young students who not only meets the basic needs of these children but is also playing an important role in providing them primary education
 ‘pahchaan’ kuch chaatro or samaajik kaaryakartaaon dwaara gathit ek samooh he
 After searching all the areas of Delhi, 'identity' decided to identify the children of the slums located behind the Indraprastha Metro station
 is basti kii aabaadi lagbhag 10 hajaar he or isamen kareeb sau bachche hai
 Most of the children are students of NDMC school but they are far behind in their level of knowledge and have no connection with modern education

 Akash, an MBA student who handles most of the 'identity' work and conducts all the meetings, said, "our goal behind establishing 'identity' is to provide primary education to children who are deprived of it

 input language morne morkal or del sten kii tufaani gati se kii gayi short pich gendon kii bambaari ke saamne duniya main sarvshereshth kahi jane vaali bhartiya ballebaaji linep ke dakshin africa ke khilaaf pehle test cricket match main parakhche ud gayi
 After the morning rain, the groundman's tireless effort made the pitch playable four hours later, but Morkel and Stein did not take him long to build a cemetery for the Indians
 kharaab roshni ke kaaran jab khel roka gaya, tab bharat 9 wicket par 136 ran banaakar sangharsh kar rahaa tha
 Captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni is still at the crease after scoring 33 runs
 unke alaava sachin tendulkar (36) or harbhajan singh (27) kaa yogadan hi thodaa ullekhneey rahaa
 Morkel scored 12 for South Africa
 1 over main 20 ran dekar chaar, jabaki sten ne 34 ran dekar teen wicket liye hai
 South African captain Graeme Smith took no time in inviting India to bat first after winning the toss after seeing the pitch moisture
 iske baad duniya kii sabase mashhoor bhartiya ballebaaji linep taash ke patton kii taraf bikhar gayi
 Tendulkar was able to play with confidence for a while while the rest of the batsmen Virender Sehwag (zero), Gautam Gambhir (five), Rahul Dravid (14), VVS Laxman (seven) and Suresh Raina (one) were late in bowling before the South African attack
 Did not put it
 bharat kii shuruyaat khaufnak rahi or dakshin africa gendbaajon ne jatala diya ki vah bhartiya salaami jodi ke liye acchhee ranneeti taiyaar karke maidan par utre hai
 The much talked about Sehwag and Steyn's fight was limited to just three balls
 sahvaag ne is gendbaaj ke pehle over kii do gend dhary ke saath kheli lekin unke duusare over kii pehali gend ne hi unhen pavilion lautaa diya
 Sehwag made an uppercut from the fast-rising ball outside off stump but instead of crossing the boundary, the ball went into the hands of Hashim Amla standing on the third man
 yadi refral pranali hoti to shaayad gambhir pehle out ho jate lekin baayen haath kaa yah ballebaaj 43 gend khilne ke baavjood puure samay sangharsh karte hue hi dikhaa
 Morkel tested him well with short pitch balls, but when suddenly a full-length ball came in front of him, he could not come to the front foot fast to drive and caught Paul Harris standing in the first slip
 dravid ne vishwasaneey shuruyaat kii tathaa sten ke ek over main do chauke lagaaye
 Meanwhile, as he completed 11 runs, he became the third batsman in the world to score the most runs, surpassing Brian Lara's 11,953 runs, but he was lbw to Morkel's middle and leg stump
 tendulkar par short pich gend kaa koi asar nahin dikhaa
 He targeted Lonwabo Tsotsobe as a change and two in his two overs
 do chauke lagaaye
 Till the tea sabbatical, India had a stronghold on them, but even after that, the South African bowlers dominated them, in which Tendulkar did not do
 tendulkar ne sten par do chauke jade or phir pari ke 25wein over main isi gendbaaj par khubasurat cat se chaukaa lagaaya lekin isi over main sidhi gend ko nahin samaj paye or pagabaadha out hokar pavilion laute
 In this way, Tendulkar, who hit eight fours in his 34-ball innings, will have to wait for the 50th century
 dhoni ko bhi gendbaajon se jujhna padaa lekin harbhajan ne vahi tevar dikhaaye jaise unhone newjiland ke khilaaf dikhaakar do shatak jade the
 He opened the account with a four on Stan and then targeted Kallis
 daayen haath ke is ballebaaj ne sotsobe kii lagaataar gend par chaukaa or phir long aan par chakka jadkar bharat kaa score 100 ran ke paar pahunchaaya
 The wickets of Harbhajan did not get to the Africans, but they had to suffer the brunt of a slight slop in taking a second run
 morkal ne isi over main ishanth sharma or phir es srisanth ko pavilion bheja jiske baad dhoni ne thodi teji dikhaayi
 He too put Sotsobe on his target and hit two sixes on him
 sotsobe ne nau over main 50 ran diye
 Jaydev Unadkat, playing his first Test match at the other end with Dhoni, is playing on one run

 There is great intoxication in publicity
 uski ek baar lat jo lag jaae to chhootati nahin
 Who wouldn't love to be in the media all the time? apana naam akhabaaron, websiton main dekhnaa or tivi camaron se ghire rahanaa vaaki bada hi romaanchak hota he
 Kejriwal likes all this and so every day he now gives some statement which should be discussed all around
 vaise bhi unhen pataa he ki bhrashtachar virdohi unki bhoomika or unke bayaan par ab utani publicity nahin milti, isliye unhone modi ke khilaaf varanasi se morcho kholaa or sampradayikta kaa raag chhedaa
 It is obviously their right as Indian citizens
 lekin usase bhi badi baat he ki vah jaanate hai ki vahaan unhen bahut zyada publicity milegi or isliye vah sonia gandhi ke ilaake main nahin gaye
 It is a 'dry area' and the person standing there cannot get the publicity that will be found from the land of Varanasi
 so kejariwal varanasimay ho gaye hai
 After describing Modi as communal, now he is also expecting violence there
 ab unhen bijepi kii har baat main shadyantr kii bu aa rahi he
 The Congress is no longer important to him because there is no publicity factor
 unhen acchhee tarah pataa he ki desh main bhale hi modi kii lahar na ho, lekin charchaa unki hi he
 In such a situation, every statement about him will get him publicity
 rahi baat media kii to uske saath yah hota rahata he
 After taking advantage of it, many 'great' persons accused him on the contrary
 kejariwal unamem se ek hai
 He describes every news published against him in the media as a conspiracy of big industrial houses
 unhen aalochana tanik manjuur nahin he
 Instead, he continues to pacify his anger by lashing out at the media
 vah media ke asahaj prashnon se kataraate hai or phir us par waar karte hai
 In fact, this media gave him so much publicity that he started believing that he would not be criticized on any subject
 or ab jabaki aalochana ho rahi he to vah ugr ho rahe hai
 They feel that the media is against them
 kejariwal yah maanakar chalate hai ki vah saare desh ke netaa or system unke prati javabdeh he lekin vah kisi ke prati nahin
 This thinking of his also inspires him to make a rude statement
 ab chunaav tak to yah chalata hi rahegaa

 BSP ke 6 vidhayak congress main hue shamilobhshf MLA ko lekar gahalot-payalat main thanirajasthan main bahujan samaaj party ke 6 vidhayakon ke congress main aane ko lekar mukhyamantri ashok gahalot or up-mukhyamantri sachin payalat main matbhed saamne aa gaye hai
 Pilot is saying that the first priority in the cabinet should be given to the Congress mlas who are sweating the blood, while Gehlot is wishing that those who have left the party for the Congress should be rewarded
 rajasthan main congress ke pradesh adhyaksh payalat ko pataa hi nahin he ki bahujan samaaj party ke 6 vidhayak congress kaa sadsy ban gaye hai
 No one can understand the fact that the party has strengthened or weakened after the BSP mlas joined the Congress
 mat poochna dil kii baat
 
 
 Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot wants that the people of Bahujan Samaj Party who have come to the Congress should be awarded some other position, while the Deputy Chief Minister Sachin Pilot is saying that he has shown the highest standards of morality, without any greed, he is the Congress Has come inside payalat kaa yah raajnneetik vyang gahalot bakhubi samaj rahe hai
 The pilot said, do not ask about the heart of me and the general secretary in charge Avinash Pandey
 payalat kaa yah dard laazmi he ki koi congress kaa sadsy ban jaae or rajya main party ke mukhiya ke paas ek baar aakar bhi nahin mili
 None of these six mlas have met Congress state president Sachin Pilot yet
 udhar payalat or gahalot kaa jhagada sulajhane aae congress ke sanghathan mahasachiv avinaash pandey ne kaha ki mantrimandal kaa jaldi vistaar hoga or jo bahujan samaaj party ke log apni party chhodkar aae hai, un par bhi vichaar kiya jayega
 Wanting to become a minister, Avinash Pandey has tried to cover up differences within the party by saying that there are different views within the party, it is a good thing for any party
 bahujan samaaj party ke vidhayak bhi intjaar kar rahe hai ki kab mantrimandal kaa vistaar ho or vah gahalot sarkaar main mantri bane
 The last time 6 mlas of Bahujan Samaj Party joined Congress in 2010, three of them became ministers
 is baar bhi inhen ummid he kuch aisa hi hoga
 The matter is not so much that 13 independent Congress members have become associate members
 vah bhi pichley 9 maheene se sarkaar kaa sukh bhogane kaa intjaar kar rahe hai
 Most of them are opposed to Sachin Pilot
 mana ja rahaa he ki payalat ne congress kaaryakartaaon or netaaon ke maan sammaan kii baat kahkar turup kaa patta chal diya he, jisaki vajah se mukhyamantri ashok gahalot ko mantrimandal ke gathan main acchhee khaasi maathapai kerani hogi
 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar may consider Lok Janshakti Party President Ram Vilas Paswan a good man but his cabinet colleague Ramai Ram does not agree with him
 He believes that Ram Vilas Paswan is a polymorphic
 unka saaf kahana he ki agar lokjanshkti party se jediu kaa gathbandhan hota he to wo mantri pad chhodane main tanik deree nahin karenge
 Raman Ram, a staunch opponent of Lok Janshakti Party President Ram Vilas Paswan, says that he is not a good man but a polymorphic
 ramai ram ne kaha ki ramvilas chaliya he wo kehete the ki ghar-ghar main diya jalaayenge wo to hua nahin ab chiraag jalaane chale hai
 Ramai Ram said that he can never consider Ram Vilas Paswan as a leader and his election from Hajipur is as sure as dying
 gauratlab he ki haal hi main nitish kumaar or ramvilas paswan ne ek-duusare kii khub tarif kii thi
 Nitish Kumar called Ram Vilas Paswan a good man and said that whether there is an alliance or not, he is always respected for me
 ramvilas paswan ne bhi nitish kumaar kii khub prashansa kii thi
 Ramai Ram did not like these things, although other party leaders also do not believe that JDU can be aligned with Lok Janshakti Party because Ram Vilas Paswan's condition is that the friend of Congress will be his friend too
 paswan ke is bayaan ko jediu ke netaa acha sanket nahin maan rahe hai
 Nitish has put the ball of the alliance in Ram Vilas Paswan's court, saying that Ram Vilas Paswan has to decide on the alliance
 lekin ye saaf kar diya ki congress ke saath unke gathbandhan kii sambhaavna main koi dam nahin he
 It is clear that the JDU wants an alliance with the Lok Janshakti Party but not on the condition of the Congress
 halaki ramvilas paswan ne 31 janvari tak congress ko gathbandhan par faisla karne kaa samay diya he

 Being stress-free is considered as difficult as it is in today's life
 adhikansh log haalanki yah jaanate hai ki tanavagrast rahane se kuch milane vaala nahin he or agar eemaandaaree se prayaas kiye jaaen to isse ubarna bhi bahut mushkil nahin he
 People still carry it on their heads like a never-ending burden
 vaise isse ubarna itnaa mushkil he nahin, iske liye jarurat sirf drudh ichhashakti or eemaandaar prayaas kii he
 Just to be determined that no matter what happens, we will not be stressed
 iskaa sarvottam upaay to yah he ki aap prabandhan ke tareeke sikhkar isse ubar sakate hai
 Meditation that will give you uninterrupted: The most effective way of managing stress is to not let stress come to you and meditation is an effective solution
 agar aap niyamit rup se dhyaan karte rahen to tanaav aapke aas-paas bhi nahin aayega
 As people generally understand, meditation is not a matter of the mysterious or supernatural world
 isaki anubhuti bhale alokik ho, lekin prakriya bilkul sansaarik or aasaan he
 Every day you take some time and sit quietly
 man main jo bhi vichaar uth rahe hon, aaen yaa jaaen, unhen chupchaap dekhte rahen
 The mind will wander for a while, but if you keep doing it regularly then after ten or twenty days that time will also come when you will go without thinking
 is prakriya ko jitna gaharaa karte jaaenge, tanaav kii ashanka aapse utani hi dur hoti jaaegi
 It is not that you can use it only before you are stressed
 agar aap tanavagrast ho chuke hai to bhi koi baat nahin he
 You can also get rid of stress by starting this experiment later
 suruchiyon ko panpane den : iskaa doosraa prabhavi upaay apni ruchi or rachanaatmakataa kaa vikaas he
 This interest can be anything from making clay toys to writing poems, trying to make new dishes, surfing the net, discovering archeology or science, trying out the stock market or getting information about the country and abroad
 aapaki jo bhi ruchi ho use puraa karen
 If you are fond of decorating your book rack or wardrobe then do the same
 iskaa sabase bada laabh yah hoga ki aapako khaali baithna nahin padegaa or tab aapako nirthak chintaaen bhi nahin gherengi
 This will save your mind from wandering, so that you will not be surrounded by negative thoughts
 jab aapaki soch nakaaratmak nahin hogi to aap tanaav se bhi grast nahin honge
 Health and Thinking: The third way is to take care of your health
 sehat acchhee banaae rakhane ke liye vah sab karen jo jaruri he
 For example, participate in sports, jogging, yoga and eat and drink on time
 isse ek taraf to aapkaa man nakaaratmak vichaaron se bachegaa or duusari sharir bhi swasthya bana rahegaa
 Whenever you feel that stress can surround you now, immediately change the direction of thinking
 kuch na ho to nakhunon kii safai par dhyaan den
 Also, whenever the mind is stable, pay attention to the cleanliness of the mind
 dhyaan, aadhyatm, ishwar kii puja or pranayam isamen aapaki sahaayta karte sakate hai
 Pick out all those thoughts that are causing pollution in you
 vastav main tanaav ke kaaran aise vichaar hi banate hai
 Peace is important: The fourth way to avoid stress is pollution-free environment
 puraa din bheed or shor bhare vaataavaran main bitaana aaj sabaki majaburi he
 But try to make the nights peaceful
 neend main vyavdhaan na pade
 When you are in the family, enjoy being among your loved ones
 anchaahi awaajen, anachaahe log, dhul, dhuaan aapako pareshaan na kar sake, iske liye jaruri he ki awaas hameshaa aisi jagah len jo shantipurna ho
 There may be some inconvenience to resources, but away from markets and industrial sites
 yah bhi dekhen ki vahaan aasapaas kuch hariyaali or park aadi bhi hon, yahaan aap subah-shaam thodaa vakt bhi bitaa saken
 Only then you will be able to get full sleep and enjoy life too
 yadi aisa kuch bhi sambhav nahin ho, to apane ghar main hi kisi shant sthaan ko chunakar shant baithen
 Give time to pets: Pets not only entertain, but sometimes they also become a protective shield for you
 isliye paaltu pashuon ko paryaapt mahatv den
 This is the fifth way of relieving stress
 kute, billi yaa kuch or sambhav na ho to chote se equarium main rang-birangi machhliyaan hi paalen
 Take care of them and spend some of your precious time with them too
 isse aap apana man to bahala hi sakate hai, khud ko akelaa bhi mahasoos nahin karenge
 Complete sleep: Deep sleep is the sixth way to overcome stress
 kadi pratispardhaa se bhare is daur main adhikansh log paryaapt neend nahin le pate
 Keep in mind, lying in bed is a different thing, but not getting enough sleep is a completely different matter
 kam se kam chah ghante kii neend har vyakti ke liye jaruri he, lekin aajkal teen ghante kii neend bhi kam log hi le pate hai
 It is absolutely common to have stress
 isliye tab bhi mauka mili neend len or koshish yah karen ki gahari neend aae
 If you do not feel comfortable or sleep interruptions, then meditate for a while before going to sleep
 phir jab sone jaaen to bistar par letne ke baad apana dhyaan saanson kii aawaaj hi par tikaaen
 You may find this effort difficult some days, but later it will cause deep sleep
 kahin dur chalem : roj ek jaisi dincharya, ek-si hai-tauba or ek hi jagah- ye sthitiyaan har aadmi ke bheetar ub paidaa karti hai
 Boredom can also be a major cause of stress
 isliye jab aapako tanaav kii anubhuti ho or aap khud ko anya tirakon se isse ubarta hua naa paaen to is saatven upaay kaa istemaal karen
 Take a long vacation and go away for a few days
 jagah aisi chune jo bahut lokapriy paryaton sthal bhi na ho
 Be a relatively unknown place
 sabase badhiya hoga kisi sudur parvatiy sthal par chale janaa
 a hill station where there is no commercial impediment to tourism
 aisi jagah pahaado main na dhundhate bane to aap village tourism kaa vikalp bhi chun sakate hai
 Take a walk, have fun, make new friends and get a spa if you get a chance
 iske baad aap khud ko bilkul nayaa anubhav karenge or tanaav ko aap dur bhaga sakenge
 In this way, it is not difficult to remove stress
 aavashyaktaa keval is baat kii he ki chaahe kuch bhi ho jaae, aapako tanavagrast nahin rahanaa he
 Anyway, problems are solved not by stress, but by effort in the right way and in the right direction
 phir akaaran tanaav ko paala hi kyon jaae? TRAI (telecom Regulatory Authority of India) has released the list of download speeds

 Reliance Jio came in the telecom sector in 2016 and since then the company has both claimed and promised to provide high speed data to the users
 companiyon main takkar tej hui or kai baar jeeyo kii speed duusare telecom ke mukaable neeche bhi gai he

 Meanwhile, there was a clash between police and lawyers on Monday in Karkardooma Court

 After the Tis Hazari scandal, there has been increased tensions between police personnel and lawyers in Delhi courts

 It is not so easy to make security arrangements in the court premises in which the open doors were openly kicked and punched between lawyers and police

 Despite all this, the police on Monday devised a special strategy to make the security of the Tis Hazari court a fortress
 is ranneeti ke tahat tay hua he ki shanivaar ko dilli police kii teesri vaahni ke jin pulicekarmiyon ke saath vakeelon kii marpet hui, unhen somvaar ko dobaaraa adaalat parisar main na lagaaya jaae
 The new and changed force to be deployed in the court campus should have a majority of police stations
 jo hameshaa aamajan ke bich kanoon vyavastha sanbhaalane kii anbhavi maani jaati he
 Whereas the Delhi Police has only the responsibility of the policemen of the Third Corps to take the prisoners from jail to court and then from court to jail
 kyon liya gaya faisla?ranneeti badalane kii pramukh vajah yah bhi he ki, shanivaar ko jo pulicekarmi or vakil aamane-saamne hue the, agar ve hi somvaar ko kahin aamane-saamne aa gaye to aisa na ho baithe-bithaae koi nai musiibat sir aa pade
 Therefore, it would be better to deploy only Police Stations and Reserve Police Force and Paramilitary Force on Monday

 is film main lead role ke liye unhone kunal goswami or deepak tijorivala kaa naam shortlist kiya tha
 Writer Jasim Khan quoted Salman in the book, "I was not going to meet Suraj, but Honey Uncle said," Go meet
 " suraj ne bataaya ki unhone do naam shortlist kar liye hai
 ' pustak main bataaya gaya he ki ‘maine pyaar kiya’ ke is role ke liye salmaan kii pehali sifarish saleem khan ke lekhan sahaayak hani gupta ne kii thi

 unke liye teesri sifarish bhagyashri ke liye patakatha likhane vaale lekhak qamar nakvi ne kii thi
 Despite this, the book states that Suraj Barjatya called him to Rajshree Film Bungalow in Worli, Mumbai, and Salman's screen test was done all day
 iske baad suraj ne ek baar phir salmaan or bhagyashri ko ek seen shoot karne ke liye apane offis main bulaayaa
 Actually, they wanted to see the chemistry of the two on screen
 pustak main kaha gaya he ki iske baavjood suraj badjatya ne unhen mumbai ke varli main rajshri film ke bangale main bulaayaa or puure din salmaan kaa screen test kiya gaya

 This time, Owaisi has put the Modi government in the dock for the situation created after the removal of Article 370 from Kashmir, unemployment, recession, GST and the decline in the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Assam

 On Monday, during a review meeting with divisional officers, he said that gaushala should be constructed soon in every district of the state
 ye congress kaa vachan patr kaa maamla hi nahin he
 This is also my feeling
 unhone kaha ki gomata sadak par nahin dikhni chahie
 It is worth mentioning that in its promissory note issued for the November assembly elections in Madhya Pradesh, the Congress had said that when the Congress government comes to the state, it will open a gaushala in every gram panchayat and give a grant for its operation
 pradesh main govadh par pratibandh he, jiske kaaran rajya main govansh kii taadaat kaaphi ho chuki he

 yuva ballebaaj viraat kohli kii naabad 87 ran kii behtareen pari ke baavjood bharat ko duusare chor se lagaataar wicket ganvaane ke kaaran dakshin africa ke khilaaf chauthe ekadivasiy antarrashtriya cricket match main dakworth louis padvati se 48 ran se haar jhelni padi
 South Africa thus managed to equalize the series 2–2
 duusari taraf bharat ko dakshin africa sarajameen par pehali baar siries jeetne ke liye ab ravivaar ko hone vaale paanchaven or antim ekadivasiy match main apana puraa jor lagaana hoga
 Batting first after winning the toss, South Africa lost five wickets for 118 runs in the midst of the fluent innings of Hashim Amla (64) and a brilliant bowling by Yuvraj Singh (three for 34) and a run-in strike
 jepi dumini (naabad 71) ne iske baad johaan botha (44) ke saath 70 or robin petersan (31) ke saath 54 ran kii saajhedaari karke team ko saat wicket par 265 ran ke majboot score tak pahunchaaya
 When rain first interrupted, then India 31
 3 over main chah wicket par 137 ran banaae the
 When the game started, India got the target of 260 runs in 46 overs, but only eight balls were bowled now that the rain came again
 ampiron ne jab match samaapt kar dakshin africa ko vijeta ghoshit kiya tab bharat ne 32
 Had scored 142 runs for six wickets in 5 overs
 bharat ko shuru se hi wicket ganvaane kaa khamiyaja bhugatna padaa
 Only Kohli could bat with full confidence
 unhone apni pari main 92 gend kheli tathaa saat chauke or do chakke lagaae
 Yuvraj (12) smashed a long over Johan Botha for a six over long on, but in the same over, he returned to the pavilion by catching Graeme Smith in an attempt to sweep the paddle
 kohli ne dabaav kii aisi paristhitiyon main behtareen ballebaaji kaa najaara pesh kiya or suresh raina ke saath milakar ek-do ran lekar pari aage badhaai
 Meanwhile, Kohli completed his 12th ODI half-century off 67 balls with five fours
 unhone vishesh rup se spinner petersan ko nishane par rakhaa or un par apni pari kaa pehla chakka jamaaya
 However, Raina was stumped in the same over and thus the partnership between him and Kohli was broken for 63 runs
 petersan kii sidhi gend khilne ke liye raina aage nikal aae, lekin vah chook gaye or wicket ke peeche abi divilliars ne apni bhoomika nibhaane main der nahin lagaai
 Incidentally, Kohli hit a six off long off in Peterson's next over as well and the left-arm spinner celebrated by dismissing the other end batsman Mahendra Singh Dhoni (2)
 bhartiya captain ne extra cover par phal tu plasis ko aasaan kaich thamaya
 Yusuf Pathan (2), the hero of India's victory in the last match, returned the pavilion as soon as Morne Morkel came out of the stump to pay a beautiful ball and got caught behind the wicket

 nehru ji ke is saadagi bhare andaaj ko yaad karte hue priyanka gandhi ne twit kiya ki mere paas mere par-naanaa se judi sabase pyaari yaad yahi he
 Priyanka Gandhi mentioned the sentry in her tweet is the late Mauji Ram

 During this time, his work, along with other works, used to spend more time with Rajiv Gandhi and Sanjay Gandhi
 is vajah rajeev or sanjay gandhi kaa maujii ram se vishesh lagaav tha
 Mukesh said that Dadaji often used to say that Nehru did not like sleeping in AC while Indira Gandhi preferred to sleep in AC
 aise hi ek din kisi kaam se mere dada nehru ji ke kamare main kisi kaam se gaye
 The room was cold due to the fact that the AC was running for a long time
 garmi main kamare ke andar itani thandak dekhakar mere dada ne thodi der vahiin rukne kaa faisla kiya
 He lay down for a while after sitting for a while on Nehruji's bed
 iske baad unhen kab neend ai iskaa unhen kuch pataa nahin chalaa
 After some time, Nehru came there
 unhone dekha ki unka santari pehle si hi unke bistar par so rahaa he
 Nehru, instead of lifting his sentry, first put a blanket over him and sat in a comfortable chair nearby with the newspaper
 kuch der akhbaar padhane ke baad nehru ji ko bhi neend ai
 After a while, another of his sentries noticed that Nehru ji is sleeping on a comfortable chair in his room while his sentry Mauji Ram is sleeping on his bed
 isaki suchi aanan-fanan main varisht adhikariyon ko di gai
 But no one was daring to go to Nehru's room to pick up Mauji Ram
 kaaphi der kii mashkkat ke baad kisi tarah se maujii ram ko uthaaya gaya
 Later Mauji Ram was terminated taking departmental action
 kuch din tak jab maujii ram nehru ji ke ghar par nahin aae to indira gandhi ne unke bare main poochna shuru kiya
 He asked Nehru ji if you had fired that sentry (mauji Ram) from his job
 isapar nehru ji ne jawaab diya, bilkul bhi nahin
 After this, senior officers of Delhi Police were specially sent to their village to recall Mauji Ram
 gaanv main dilli police kii ek trek ai to gaanv waalon main hadakamp much gaya
 Mauji Ram himself left the house and hid in a hut built in a nearby field
 unhen laga ki police ne unhen pakadaney ai he unhen pakadakar jail main daal diya jayega
 Later the policemen explained to the elderly people of the villages that Nehru ji sent Mauji Ram to call him again on the job
 mouj ram ke saath gaanv ke kuch bujurg saath gaye, or tabhi gaanv waapas aae jab mouj ram ne naukari jwine nahin kar lee
