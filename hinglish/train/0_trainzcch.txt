 The past days were seen romancing in the same quilt, and in a recent video, Punish was heard asking Bandgi to strip
 in donon kii harkaton kaa asar ab inke gharavaalon par bhi padane laga he
 According to the news, due to the increased blood pressure, the father of the bandhigi has to admit in the hospital
 vahiin duusari taraf mumbai main jahaan bandagi rahati he
 The landlord of that house has also given Bandi an ultimatum to vacate the house
 media sorce kii jaankaree ke mutabik bandagi ke landlord nahin chaahate hai ki ab wo unke ghar main rahen
 That is why he called Bandgi's friend and said that as soon as Bandgi comes out of Bigg Boss house, he will have to vacate the house
 'shilpa-vikaas main tha physical relation, ek-duusare ko kar chuke hai date'khabaron kii maane to bandagi punjab ke bahut chote se shahar se hai or ab unki ye harakatein unke parivaar waalon kii bardaashat ke baahar bhi hoti ja rahi hai
 His father's health deteriorated due to the notoriety caused by the bandh, due to which he had to be admitted to the hospital
 Bigg Boss11: arshi ne paar kii sari hadein, akaash kii pant utaarti dikhinpunish kii vajah se bandagi ab apane real life boyfriend big bos ke casting diarector denis nagpal ko chit kar chuki hai
 Seeing such acts of Punish and Bandgi, Dennis has severed his relationship with Bandgi
 inke pyaar ke gubaar ne gharavaalon ko bhi pareshaan karke rakhaa hua he
 They also become uncomfortable in their presence
 ab to inhen salmaan khan bhi hidaayat de chuke hai
 But these two do not seem to make a difference
 bandagi-punish par salmaan kii daant kaa asar nahin, bathrum main kii ye harakatweekend ke waar main salmaan ne inhen kaha tha, pyaar par kisi kaa bas nahin chalata
 But these shows are also being watched by your parents
 isliye agar yah sab aap apane gharavaalon ke saamne kar sakate hai to thik he varanaa ye sab naa karen
 He tweeted, 'we are proud of our bravery on our Army and have full faith

 ham unka sammaan karte hai

 He tweeted, 'prime Minister some ministers of your government say 300 terrorists were killed, BJP President says 250 are killed, Yogi Adityanath says 400 are killed and your minister SS Ahluwalia says no one died
 or aap is vishay main maun hai
 The country wants to know who is the liar in it
 modi ji sawaal naa siyasat kaa he naa satta kaa
 The question is of the siblings who have lost their brothers, the question is of the mother who has lost her martyrdom and the question of the heroine who has lost her husband

 And you are silent about this
 desh jaananaa chahta he ki isamen jhootha koun he
 On making the surgical strike of the Indian Air Force an electoral issue, Digvijay Singh tweeted, 'the way you are trying to make the success of your senior leader and your party army an electoral issue by proving only your success is that of our country
 The bravery and dedication of security personnel is an insult
 desh kaa har naagarik bhartiya sena va samast suraksha karmiyon kaa sammaan karata he
 Modi ji's question is neither of politics nor of power

 sarkaar kaa sabase mahatvapurn adhyadesh bhoomi adhigrahan bill rajyasabha main fansaa padaa he
 The situation is that the government has two land acquisition bills, one bill which is introduced in Rajya Sabha and the other bill which has been passed by Lok Sabha
 rajyasabha main bahumat na hone kii vajah se sarkaar bhoomi adhigrahan kaa bill vaapis lene main vifal rahi he or ab ajeeb si sthiti paidaa ho gai he
 The problem in the government is that their own ally Shiv Sena is also not with this bill
 aise main sarkaar vipaksh par nigahen tikaae he
 The government is definitely eyeing the BSP and the Samajwadi Party, but the rest of the opposition has also kept a strategy and decided to march from Parliament to Rashtrapati Bhavan to demonstrate their solidarity
 sarkaar ke paas vikalp kaaphi kam hai
 For one, the government should increase the budget session a little and try to form a consensus, but it seems unlikely because the opposition wants to send the land acquisition bill to the select committee
 sarkaar ke paas doosraa rasta he ki rajyasabha kaa satr samaapt kiya jaae or adhyadesh laayaa jaae magar abhi rajyasabha main bajet bhi paas hona he, isliye sarkaar ye faisla karne main hichak rahi he
 However, the government has no option but to bring an ordinance
 phir bhi vahi sawaal saamne he ki bhoomi adhigrahan bill paas kaise hoga
 The government would like that the land bill which is in the opposition Rajya Sabha be sent to the Select Committee and waited for its report
 is bich main sarkaar adhyadesh se kaam chalaa sakati he
 The next part of the budget session will start after a month, till then the report of the Select Committee will not be available
 select kamity se jo bill aayega use hi rajyasabha paas karegi
 Then that bill will go to the Lok Sabha where it will be passed
 sarkaar ke paas dikkat ye bhi he ki rajyasabha ne bhoomi bill ko riject yaa voting ke jariye khaarij nahin kiya he isliye sarkaar saajha satr bhi nahin bula sakati, yani sarkaar ke saamne pahaad jaisi dikkat he or vipaksh ko bada mudda haath laga he

 BJP President Amit Shah termed all the allegations of the Aam Aadmi Party against Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley as 'baseless and beyond the truth' and said that the party stands with solidarity with him and no plot to insult him is successful
 will be given
 jetali ke saath khadey hote hue amit shah ne dilli kii arvind kejariwal sarkaar dwaara jaanch ayog gathit kiye jane kii vaidhata par bhi sawaal khadey kiye
 The BJP president attacked AAP saying that if it ('AAP') feels that it can harm Jaitley's image through its malicious efforts, then it is like daydreaming
 aisi koshishon kaa ulte 'aap' par hi asar padegaa or party kii chhavi dhoomil hogi
 Amit Shah said in a statement that all the allegations against Jaitley are baseless and he has no connection with the truth
 yah jetali kaa apmaan karne kii sajeesh he
 The BJP is united with them and any attempt to insult them will not be allowed to succeed
 unhone kaha ki jetali kaa puraa jivan ek khuli kitaab kii tarah he or desh ke prati samarpit rahaa he
 It is unthinkable to make such allegations against him, as the SFIO has already dismissed any involvement of him in the functioning of DDCA
 tippaniyan Amit Shah's statement has come in the wake of the sharp attack on Jaitley by AAP and Delhi government
 'aap' ne 1999 se 2013 ke bich didisie ke pramukh ke taur par 13 saal ke jetali ke kaarykaal ke dauraan hui kathith vittiya aniyamittaaon ko lekar unke istife kii maang kii he
 Amit Shah questioned the commission and its jurisdiction and wondered how the functioning of DDCA could come under the purview of a one-member commission, a matter of legal debate
 unhone ayog gathit kiye jane or is bare main dilli vidhansabha kaa vishesh satr bulaane ke 'aap' ke kadam ko dhyaan bhatakaane vaali tarkeeb bhi bataaya
 While standing with Jaitley, Amit Shah also questioned the legality of Delhi's Arvind Kejriwal government setting up a commission of inquiry
 bijepi adhyaksh ne 'aap' par prahaar karte hue kaha ki yadi ise ('aap' ko) lagata he ki yah apni durbhaavnapurna koshishon ke jariye jetali kii chhavi ko nuksaan pahunchaa sakati he, to yah din main sapane dekhne jaisaa he
 Such efforts will adversely affect AAP and the party's image will be tarnished
 amit shah ne ek bayaan main kaha, jetali ke khilaaf lagaae gaye saare aarope bebuniyaad hai or unka sachai se dur-dur tak koi naata nahin he
 It is a conspiracy to insult Jaitley
 bijepi unke saath ekajute he or unke apmaan kii kisi bhi koshish ko safal nahin hone diya jayega
 He said that Jaitley's entire life is like an open book and has been devoted to the country
 unke khilaaf is tarah ke aarope lagaana samaj se pare he, kyonki esaio ne didisie ke kaamkaaj main unki kisi bhi tarah kii sanliptata hone ko pehle hi khaarij kar diya he
 The comments 'aap' or dilli sarkaar dwaara jetali par kiye gaye tikhe hamale ke maddenjar amit shah kaa bayaan aayaa he

 pakistan main jaish-e-mohammad ke thikaanon par bhartiya vaayu sena ke air strike karne ke baad soshal media par farji khabaron kaa silsilaa ek baar phir tej ho gaya he
 a picture of a female pilot on Facebook is becoming increasingly viral
 daawa kiya ja rahaa he ki tasviir main dikh rahi mahila payalat kaa naam anitha sharma he or is air strike main usne bhi hissaa liya tha
 The archived version of this post can be seen here
 india today anti phek news war room (AFWA) ne apni padtaal main paaya ki yah tasviir bhartiya vayusena kii fiter payalat a vani chaturvedi kii he
 Posting this picture on the Facebook page "I am Gauputra", the caption wrote: "anita Sharma Congratulations to this Indian lioness, Stree Shakti, Airforce female soldier who entered Pakistan and killed 300 terrorists
" "fasebuk pej"modi mania"or"saare jahaan kaa dil"se bhi is tasviir ko share kiya ja rahaa he
 By the time the news was written, this picture had been shared more than 2500 times from different Facebook pages
 viral ho rahi tasviir kaa sach jaanane ke liye jab ise reverse search kiya gaya to hamane paaya ki tasviir main najar aa rahi mahila payalat kaa naam ani ta sharma nahin balki a vani chaturvedi he
 In February 2018, Indian Air Force fighter pilot Avni Chaturvedi became the first Indian woman to fly a mig-21 Bison fighter aircraft alone
 us samayajatakasamet kai pratishthitmedia sansthanone is khabar ko pramukhataa se prakashit kiya tha
 It became clear in the investigation that the viral picture is of Indian Air Force fighter pilot Avni Chaturvedi
 haalanki avani is air strike karne vaali team kaa hissaa thi yaa nahin, iskaa khulaasa nahin hua he
 Usually the names of the soldiers who took part in such operations are not disclosed
 bhartiya vayusena or bharat sarkaar ne bhi 26 farvari ko hue puure oparation main hissaa lene vaale adhikariyon ke naam is vaqt gupt rakhe hai
 For this reason, it is not correct to say that any female officer participated in this operation
 agar aapako lagata he ki sarkaar to tamaam chizon par jiesti ke rate main kami kar rahi he lekin apko uskaa phayda nahin miltaa to aapkaa shaq bilkul sahi he
 The government has also received many complaints that companies and shopkeepers are not reaching the benefit of reduction in GST and many things are not getting cheap even after the tax is reduced
 lekin ab sarkaar ne jiesti kii aad main munafkhori karne waalon kii nakel kasne kaa intjaam kar liya he
 The cabinet on Thursday approved the formation of the anti-profiting Authority (NAA) for GST
 isamen tatkaal ek chayaraman or technical members kii bahaali kii jaaegi
 The task of the NAA will be to monitor that action is taken against those who are grabbing themselves instead of passing the benefit of tax cuts to the customers
 15 november se hi tamaam chizon par jiesti kii ghati hui daren lagu hui hai jinamein restaurant main khaane par jiesti 18 fisadi se ghataakar 5 fisadi karnaa shaamil he
 Giving information about the decisions of the cabinet, Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said that recently the government has drastically reduced the rate of GST, excluding 59 things and excluding most of the things which are useful to the common man, out of the purview of GST of 28%
 Have given
 bahut sari chizon ko ab sabase kam 5 pratishat tex kii shrenee main laayaa gaya he
 After this, the Government has made it clear that the Government is committed to bring benefits of low tax to the common people by constituting anti-profiting Authority (NAA)
 aisa hoga enee kaa prarooshgar logon ko lagegaa ki jiesti main hue tex kaa phayda unako nahin mil rahaa he to ve anti profitring othority (enee) main shikaayat kar sakenge
 The head of the NAA will be a secretary-level officer and will have four technical members who can be from the Center or from the states
 kendra main anti profitring othority (enee) ke alaava iske liye ek standig cameti or sabhi rajyon main screening cameti hogi
 How to complain if a customer feels that he is not getting the benefit of GST, then he can complain to the screening committee in his state
 lekin munafkhori kaa maamla aisa ho jisase bahut saare log prabhavit hote hon yaa phir uskaa asar puure desh par pad saktaa he to sidhe standing cameti ko bhi shikaayat kii ja sakati he
 The Director General of Safeguards under CBEC will hand over the investigation of complaints to NAA on the basis of which appropriate action will be taken
 radd ho saktaa he jiesti registrationenee shikaayat ko sahi paae jane par yaa to chizon kii keemat kam karne kaa aadesh de saktaa he or agar maamla behad gambhir hua to jurmaana bhi laga saktaa he
 GST registration can also be canceled in very serious cases

 Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi are likely to meet at the SAARC conference on 26 November in Nepal's capital Kathmandu
 'da indian express' kii khabar ke mutabik, saarc sammelan main navaj-modi kii sambhaavnaaon ko dekhte hue videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa akbaruddin ne kaha ki bharat pakistan ke saath hameshaa se hi shantipurna sambandhon kaa pakshdhar rahaa he
 PM Modi is ready to communicate meaningfully with the heads of SAARC countries
 piem in samvaad ke jariye rishton ko behatar banane kii koshish karenge
 According to sources, the meeting of Nawaz Sharif and PM Modi will not be formal
 donon deshon ke pramukh kii mulaakaat saarc sammelan ke shedul se hatakar ho sakati he
 Akbaruddin informed that the schedule of meetings has been prepared
 hamaari koshish he ki saarc ke dauraan hone vaali mulakaaton se samasyaon kaa hal nikal sake
 On the other hand, it has been said by the Pakistan Foreign Ministry that Sharif will also meet the heads of nations of the countries on the occasion of the SAARC conference
 in mulaakaton ke jariye piem sharif kshetreey samasyaon or dwipaksheeya sambandhon ko sudhaarney kii koshish karenge
 It is worth mentioning that earlier there were reports that there would be no bilateral talks between PM Modi and Nawaz Sharif during the SAARC conference
 beete dinon i-rickshaw kii charging ke vakt aag lagane se teen logon kii maut kii khabar ne sabko chaunkaa diya tha, is haadase main kai buree tarah se jhulas gaye the jab uski jaanch kii gai to pataa chalaa tha ki i-rickshaw ko gaiyr kanoonee dhang se ghar main charge kiya ja rahaa tha jiske baad short circuit hua or aag lag gai
 Now a new twist has come in this matter, it is reported that the governments have done the task of regulating the e-rickshaw but forgot to arrange its fuel, that is why thousands of e-rickshaws are roaming on the road but There is no arrangement for their charging
 natijatan rickshaw chaalak avaidh tareeke se bane charging point par charge karne ko majaboor he
 Chargers charge arbitrary rickshaws
 Many rickshaw drivers say that rickshaws have to be charged at the private place in which those people charge arbitrarily
 isamen khatra to he hi bijli chori bhi hoti he
 Let us tell you that about one lakh e-rickshaws are running in the streets of Delhi, out of which more than 70 percent are illegally on the road
 dilli ke aar ke ashram ke paas khadey cycle rickshaw chaalak apni-apni sawari kaa intjaar kar rahe hai rickshaw chaalkon kaa kahana he kii sarkaron ne i-rickshaw baat die sadak par chalane kii ijazat bhi de di lekin yah charge kahaan se honge yah nahin bataaya natijan gaiyr kanoonee dhang se chal rahe i-rickshaw charging point par manamaane tareeke se maang rahe paise dekar mafiaon se charge karana padataa he
 At the same time, the e-rickshaw union says that the government should soon make charging points on the lines of petrol pumps, only by doing vote bank politics will not do anything
 jaahir he beete dino hua haadasa bhi isi vajah se hua tha, aise main jarurat he ki ab sarkaar ke dwaara turant hi kade kadam uthaae jaaen

 The second moon mission of the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) Chandrayaan-2 has been launched successfully
 chandrayan-2 ko 22 july ko dopaher 2
 The most powerful Bahubali rocket GSLV-MK3 was launched at 43 pm
 ab chand ke dakshini dhruv tak pahunchane ke liye chandrayan-2 kii 48 din kii yatra shuru ho gai he
 Around 16
 23 minute baad chandrayan-2 prithvi se kareeb 182 kimi kii oonchai par jieselvi-emke3 rocket se alag hokar prithvi kii kaksha main chakkar lagaana shuru karegaa
 Various stages of Chandrayaan-2's 48-day journey Chandrayaan-2 spacecraft will revolve around the Earth from 22 July to 13 August
 iske baad 13 agast se 19 agast tak chand kii taraf jane vaali lambii kaksha main yatra karegaa
 It will reach the moon's orbit only on August 19
 iske baad 13 din yani 31 agast tak vah chand ke chaaron taraf chakkar lagayegaa
 Then on 1 September, Vikram will separate from the lander orbiter and begin the journey towards the south pole of the moon
 5 din kii yatra ke baad 6 sitambar ko vikram lander chand ke dakshini dhruv par land karegaa
 About 4 hours after landing, the rover will descend from the Pragya lander to perform various experiments on the lunar surface
 jaaniye
 
 
 What was the difference between the launching of July 15 and the launching of July 22? prithvi ke orbit main jane kaa samay kareeb ek minute badha diya gaya he22 julychandrayan-2 ab 974
 30 seconds (about 16
 23 minute) main prithvi se 181
 Will reach an altitude of 65 km
 15 julychandrayan-2 ko tab 973
 70 seconds (about 16
 22 minute) main prithvi se 181
 Had to go 61 km

 Changes in oval circle around the earth, 60 in apogee
 4 kimi kaa antar22 julychandrayan-2 lonching ke baad prithvi ke chaaron taraf andakaar kaksha main chakkar lagayegaa
 Its perigee (less distance from Earth) will be 170 km and apogee (more distance from Earth) will be 39120 km
 15 julychandrayan-2 agar launch hota to isaki periji 170
 06 km and apogee 39059
 60 kimi hoti
 Ie 60 in apogee
 4 kimi kaa antar laayaa gaya he
 That is, the roundabout around the earth will be reduced
 3
 a 6-day reduction in the time of Chandrayaan-2 to the moon
 If Chandrayaan-2 was successfully launched on July 15, it would land on the south pole of the moon on 6 September
 lekin aaj kii lonching ke baad chandrayan-2 ko chand par pahunchane main 48 din hi lagenge
 That is, Chandrayaan-2 will reach the moon only on 6 September
 isro vaigyanik iske liye chandrayan-2 ko prithvi ke chaaron taraf lagane vaale chakkar main katautee hogi
 Probably now Chandrayaan-2 made four rounds around the earth instead of 5
 4
 1 in Velocity of Chandrayaan-2
 12 meter prati second kaa ijapha kiya gayachandrayan-2 aaj yani 22 july ko launch hone ke baad ab chand kii ore zyada teji se jayega
 Now its speed 10305 in space
 78 meter prati second hogi
 Whereas, it would have been launched on July 15, 10,304
 66 meter prati second kii gati se chand kii taraf jaataa
 Ie 1 in its speed
 12 meter prati second kaa ijapha kiya gaya he
 Why Chandrayaan-2 mission is important for ISRO, five big reasons 1
 vaigyanik kshamta dikhaanaa - jab rus ne manaa kiya to ISRO vaigyanikon ne khud banaaya lander-rovernovember 2007 main roosi antariksh agency roscosmos ne kaha tha ki vah is project main saath kaam karegaa
 He will give Lander to ISRO
 2008 main is mishan ko sarkaar se anumati mili
 The design of Chandrayaan-2 was completed in 2009
 janvari 2013 main lonching tay thi, lekin roosi antariksh agency roscosmos lander nahin de pai
 ISRO fixed the launch of Chandrayaan-2 in March 2018
 lekin kuch test ke liye lonching ko april 2018 or phir oktober 2018 tak taala gaya
 Meanwhile, in June 2018, ISRO decided that Chandrayaan-2 will be launched in January 2019 by making some changes
 phir launch date badhaakar farvari 2019 kiya gaya
 The launch news was also reported in April 2019
 is mishan kii safalataa se yah saaf ho jayega ki hamaare vaigyanik kisi ke mohataaj nahin hai
 They can complete any mission

 isro's Small Step, Long Jump to Build India Image With its second moon mission Chandrayaan-2, ISRO may be making a small step in the world of space science, but it proves to be a quantum leap to build India's image
 Can
 kyonki abhi tak duniya ke paanch desh hi chand par soft landing kara paae hai
 These countries are - America, Russia, Europe, China and Japan
 iske baad bharat aisa karne vaala chatha desh hoga
 However, Rover is the fourth country to land
 isse pehle america, rus or china chand par lander or rover utaar chuke hai

 kathin jagah kaa chunaavah chand par jagah vah chuni, jahaan abhi tak koi desh nahin pahunchaa heisro ke anusaar chandrayan 2 bhartiya moon mishan he jo puri himmat se chaand ke dakshini dhruv kshetra main utrega jahaan abhi tak koi desh nahin pahunchaa he – yani ki chandramaa kaa dakshini dhruviya kshetra
 Its purpose is to collect information about the moon
 aisi khoj karnaa jinase bharat ke saath hi puri maanavtaa ko phayda hoga
 On the basis of these tests and experiences, necessary major changes will be made in the preparation of future lunar missions
 taaki aane vaale daur ke chandra abhiyaanon main apanaai jane vaali nai technology ko banane or unhen tay karne main madad mili

 sabase taqatvar rocket GSLV mk-iii kaa upyog ho rahaa he chandrayan-2 mishan menkeghshwa mk-iii bharat kaa ab tak kaa sabase shaktishaalee launture he
 It has been made entirely in the country
 teen stage kaa yah rocket 4 hajaar kilo ke upgrah ko 35,786 kimi se lekar 42,164 kimi kii oonchai par sthit jeeosincronas orbit main pahunchaa saktaa he
 Alternatively, a satellite of 10 thousand kg can reach 160 to 2000 km of Low Earth Orbit
 is rocket ke jariye 5 june 2017 ko jiset-19 or 14 november 2018 ko jiset-29 kaa safal prakshepan kiya ja chukaa he

 Everyone's dream is a dream home
 jab ye sapanom kaa ashiana naseeb ho jaataa he, to insaan jald se jald usamen shift ho jaataa he
 However, industrialist Mukesh Ambani did not do so
 dakshin mumbai main unke sapanom ke mahal antila ko bane kareeb salbhar ho chuke hai, lekin mukesh ambani vahaan puri tarah shift nahin hue
 Since this was never said by Mukesh or Reliance, speculation has started
 mukesh ke mahal kii khubsuurati aisi he ki dekhne waalo dang rah jaaen
 It is large enough to stand just below the palace, so it becomes difficult to count the floors
 kuch log to ise ikkisvin sadi kaa tajmahal tak kehete hai
 In such a situation, who would not want to live in the dream of this beautiful dream? lekin, aisi khabaren hai ki pichley saal 28 oktober ko antila main grih-pravesh ke baad bhi is ashiyane ke maalik mukesh ambani or unka parivaar ab tak yahaan puri tarah shift nahin hua he
 Despite the dream palace being ready, a period of speculation has started about why Mukesh has not come here to live fully
 sawaal uth rahe hai ki sapanom ke mahal main kyon shift nahin hue mukesh ambani? kya antila main he koi vaastudosh? kya vaastudosh kii vajah se antila main nahin rahete mukesh ambani?jawaab he haa
 According to a newspaper report, Mukesh Ambani has not been able to shift completely there even after a year due to Vastu defects
 aisi atakalein hai ki vaastudosh kii vajah se mahal main negative urja aa rahi he
 There is a possibility that negative energy may breach relationships
 aisi atakalein hai ki mahal ke dakshin-pashchim hisse se negative enrty kaa sanchaar ho rahaa he, jo vahaan rahane vaale logon ke bich anban paidaa sakati he
 There can be differences between them even on a minor matter
 shaayad isi vajah se mukesh ambani apane mahal se dur hai
 Mukesh Ambani, along with his wife Nita Ambani and three children, still live in their old sea-wind Ashiana
 14 manzile si wind ashiyane main hi unki maa or unke chote bhai anil ambani kaa parivaar bhi rahata he
 Significantly, when home entry took place last year, on that day dozens of pandits were called for havan and special puja
 yahaan tak ki bade-bade udyogpati bhi grihpravesh ke din di gai party main shaamil hue the
 It is reported that the Oberoi Group is training the employees working in the building, so that there is no effort for the guests of the visitors
 lekin, abhi bhi antila ko apane maalik kaa intjaar he
 Why Mukesh Ambani and his family are not completely shifting in Antilla, there is no official statement from the Reliance Group, nor the Ambani family is ready to say anything on this
 is bare main jab bhi reliance ke pravaktaa se sawaal poocha gaya unhone ise nijee maamla bataakar taal diya
 According to the news published in the newspaper, even close to Mukesh Ambani does not want to say much on this
 haalanki, akhbaar ke mutabik unke ek mitra kaa kahana he ki ambani parivaar vahaan kuch raaten guzaar chukaa he
 Obviously, it is difficult to say with certainty that the reason for Mukesh Ambani's absence in Antilla is Vastudosh
 chunki, reliance group or ambani parivaar is par kuch bhi kehane ko taiyaar nahin, lihaaja atakalon kaa garmana lajimi he or in atakalon main vaastu dosha kii charchaa sabase zyada he

 co / bvyqfvfvda tell that Akshay Kumar (akshay Kumar), Riteish Deshmukh (bobby Deol), Kriti Sanon starrer film 'housefull 4' is going to release on 26 October 
 film kaa bajet kareeb 75 karod rupee bataaya ja rahaa he
 The special thing is that the first three films of the 'housefull' series have been liked, and this time an attempt has been made to instill a comedy through double role
 haalanki film ko lekar soshal media par khub riection aa rahe hai, or mims bhi ban rahe hai
 What can you do with an irresponsible boy who loses focus only on his steely chest and ideal gestures for filmy entertainment, who succeeds on the strength of his mother, sister and girlfriends and friendship You sacrifice everything for aise hi charitra vaale ladke kii romantic kahani he 'ai me or main' jisamen hansane ke liye bahut kuch he
 In this film, John Abraham plays an enchanted character who is ready to fall anytime in his life
 'ai me or main' ek aise karporati vaataavaran kii kahani he jahaan mahilaon ko purushon kii hi tarah safal hone kii ijaajat he, bhale hi vah safalataa kisi bhi keemat par aae
 That is why no one is surprised when Anushka (chitrangada) leaves Ishaan (john Abraham) alone in her room, but also in life
 ishan bhi bina samay ganvaae ek nae apartment main chalaa jaataa he jahaan vah bagal ke apartment main rahane vaali gauri (praachi desai) se flert karnaa shuru kar detaa he
 This is a very dangerous start for the Indian film industry
 film kaa koi bhi charitra kahani se upar nahin uth paaya he
 One of the characters that has become the most interesting among them all is Ishaan's stylish boss Bina (raima Sen) who takes over the entire business and leaves Ishaan on her side
 jon ko aise baddimag, charitraheen kirdaar main dekhnaa ruchikar he jise aap apni beti yaa bahan ke saath nahin dekhnaa chahenge
 John has played the character without hesitation
 film main gane kahin bhi chale aate hai
 In fact, 'I Me Aur Main' is a good romantic comedy which is the story of a mean boy and two beautiful women in his life
 buudhvaar kaa din sansadeey maryaadaaon ke liye ek kadam or gart main jane vaala tha
 The occasion was a vote of thanks to Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the Rajya Sabha on the President's address
 lekin isaki parinti sadan ke bahishkaar or katutapurna tippaniyon ke bich sansadeey maryaadaaon ke or adhik kamazor hone ke taur par hui
 In his thanks speech, the Prime Minister targeted the opposition
 yahaan tak ki sadasyon par nijee tippaniyan bhi pradhanmantri ke bhaashan main thim
 Many times it happened that the Prime Minister even forgot that he is in the House and he has to give his address to the Chair, not the people
 bathroom main renkot pahanakar nahaana koi manmohan se siikhe: modipradhanmantri ke vaktavy ko sadan ke kai vipakshi saansadon ne chunaav bhaashan tak qaraar diya
 This happened because there were many parts of the speech that the Prime Minister has been speaking in his election rallies
 aisi baaten, aise tathy is bhaashan main rahe jo dhanyavad auki saansadon ke prashnon kaa jawaab na hokar raajnneetik vaktavy jaise the
 The most unhappy Vice President was that both sides accused the Speaker of the House, Vice President Hamid Ansari
 jahaan sattapaksh ke saansadon ne kaha ki aapke rahete sadan main aisa nakaaratmak maahaul he, vahiin vipaksh ke netaaon ne bhi niyamon kii duhai dete hue pakshpaat kaa aarope lagaaya
 At the end of the Prime Minister's speech, Hamid Ansari got up from his chair and addressed the House, saying, “I have seen the afternoon proceedings with great difficulty
 main kisi ek par aarope nahin lagaana chahta kyonki agar is puure prakaran ko dekhen to sadan ke sabhi sadasyon (sattapaksh or vipaksh) ko is takalifdeh sthiti kaa aarope saajha karnaa padegaa
 After this the process of voting on the vote of thanks began
 lekin jis tarah se uparashtrapati ko bhi sadasyon kii tippaniyon or vyavhaar kaa saamana karnaa padaa, wo voting ke pehle hi sadan chhodkar chale gaye
 Voting in the House was completed in the presence of Deputy Chairman Kurian
 raashtrapati ke abhibhaashan par voting ke samay sadan main sanshodhan prastaavon par vot dene ke liye vipaksh kaa koi saansad maujuud nahin tha
 By the time all the mps had walked out
 yah sadan main sarkaar or sansadeey prakriya ke liye ek sharmnaak sthiti thi
 The dignity of the Prime Minister has diminished such that no Prime Minister has ever been seen in the House carrying out such a fierce and personal attack
 visheshkar dhanyavad prastaav par vaktavy dete hue is tarah ke nijee akshep pehle sadan main kabhi dekhne ko nahin mili
 Raising slogans against PM Modi in the Rajya Sabha over the 'raincoat' attack, the Prime Minister even commented about one of the senior most members of the House, Manmohan Singh, that he is skilled in the art of bathing in a bathroom wearing a raincoat
 isse congress ke saansad kaaphi ugr ho gaye or phir manmohan singh sahit sabhi party saansad walkout kar gaye
 The Prime Minister made similar remarks about JDU MP Sharad Yadav and CPM MP Sitaram Yechury
 sharad yadav jab bich main kuch bolnaa chaah rahe the to peeth ko sambodhit karne ke bajaay pradhanmantri ne unase sidhe mukhaatib hote hue kaha ki aap abhi baith jaaie, baad main jo kahana ho, kah lijiega
 i will listen to you all my life
 seetaram yechuri ke saath aisi hi baat kehete hue pradhanmantri ek paaydaan or neeche utar gaye
 He said, "later i have to answer, brother, it's been a whole life
 kahin na kahin se aa hi jaaoge
 However, after the Prime Minister's speech, the ruling party did not allow both members to speak while citing the rules and demanded direct voting
 vipakshi netaaon kaa maananaa he ki jis tarah ke nirnay pradhanmantri ne pichley dinon liye hai or jis tarah kaa sankat aagaamee vidhansabha chunaavon main party ko dikhaai de rahaa he, uske chalate pradhanmantri main aisi baukhalaahat dekhne ko mil rahi he
 In parliamentary decorum and traditions, Wednesday has been recorded as falling down a notch
 (iti) The deadlock over government formation in Maharashtra (maharashtra) continues
 is bichcongress or ensipi kii saajha press kanference ke baad uddhav thakare (uddhav Thackeray) ne kaha kisarkaar banane ko lekar shivasena, congress or ensipi se baatcheet karti rahegi
 a new formula to form a government in Maharashtra is also coming out
 sutron ke mutabik dhai-dhai saal shivasena or NCP kaa mukhyamantri hoga or puure 5 saal ke liye congress kaa upmukhyamantri hoga
 After a joint press conference, Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray said that if BJP and Mehbooba Mufti can work together by resolving ideological differences, then in the current situation their party will find a formula to work with Congress and NCP
 uddhav thakare neye bhi kaha ki bijepi ke PDP or nitish ke saath samjhaute kii jaankaree mangvayi he, jisase ye samaj saken kii alag-alag vichaardhaara vaale dal kaise saath aate hai
 In response to a question, Uddhav also said that the BJP has ended the options, not his party
 bataa den kishivsena adhyaksh uddhav thakrene mangalvaar ko hi kaha thaki bhartiya janata partybhajpa maharashtra main sarkaar banane ke liye anadhikarik madhyamon se abhi bhi sampark kar rahi he
 Thackeray said, “they are making vague and different proposals every time
 lekin hamanecongress-rashtravaadi congress partike saath jane kaa nirnay liya he
 " bharat vaasiyon ne 200 saal se bhi zyada angreji hukumat main gulaami kii saans lee he
 a soldier was involved in India's first freedom struggle against the East India Company in 1857
 us sainik kaa kapaal abhi tak uski mathrubhumi tak nahin pahunchaa he
 In this case, a British historian wants the Indian soldier's skull to be handed over to his motherland, India, which was involved in a revolt against the East India Company in 1857
 use vidroh main shaamil hone ke jurm main faansee de di gai thi
 This historian wants this soldier's skull to be buried at the same place where he participated in the last battle
 landan sthit queen mairi college main british imperial history ke varisht lekturer dow kim vagner kaa maananaa he ki hawaldaar alam bheg (vidroh main shaamil ek pramukh nayak) ko uske desh main dafnane kaa yah sahi samay he
 In fact, in the first Indian War of Independence in 1857, an Indian soldier in the British army considered the British soldier Alam Bhag as a rebellion in the freedom struggle of India
 us samay duty par rahe captain eaar castelo alam bheg ke sir ko kaat kar england lekar chalaa gaya tha
 Bhag was hanged in India on the charge of this rebellion
 ise bhi padhein: aaj hi di gai thi mangal pandeya ko faansee, jaane- unase judin khaas batenhal main ai kitaab 'da scal of alam bheg: da life and deth of e rebel in 1857' ke lekhak vagner ne kaha ki bheg kii regiment mulat: kanpur main sthapit thi, lekin meraa maananaa he ki uske kapaal ko bharat or pakistan ke bich simavarti ilaake main raavi nadi ke kinaaren dafnaanaa uchit rahegaa jahaan alam bheg ne trimmu ghat kii ladaai main bhaag liya tha
 He said, 'I do not consider the return of Alam Bhag's skull to politics
 meraa focus sirf yah he ki alam bheg ke avshesh uski mathrubhumi tak pahunchaae jaaen jisase ki uske marane ke 160 saal baad uski aatma ko shanti mil sake
 'significantly, the historian has sparked a debate between diplomats from India and Britain
 alam beg ke dukhad ant ke ird-gird 1857 ke vidroh par lekturer dow kim vagner kaa shodh or lekhan 2014 main tab shuru hua jab beg ke parivaar ne unase sampark kiya jo kapaal lene aayaa tha
 Let us tell you that in the year 1963, Alam Bhag's skull was found in a pub located in the city of Valmer, Kent
 lord clide pub ke nae maalik ko yah kapaal ek chote se store room main mila tha
 It was written about this skull that it belonged to an Indian soldier in the service of the East India Company, who was accused of killing the entire family of a Scottish missionary
 madhya pradesh ke kai hisson main jal sankat gaharaaya hua he, logon ko kai kilometre kaa rasta tay karne ke baad hi pani mil rahaa he
 The tap-water scheme is failing in a large part of the state
 kune or nalakup sookhne ke kagaar par hai, talabon main pani bahut kam bachaa he
 At the same time, more than three hundred donkeys are working to carry water for drinking in two villages of the state's tribal-dominated Alirajpur district
 madhya pradesh ke alirajpur jile ke narmada kinare sardaar sarovar pariyojna ke ilaake main based sugat or chameli gaanv ke kareeb 300 gadhe apane maalikon ke liye raat-din pani dhone ke kaam main jute hai
 They are carrying water from a place where the water has to be filled in the bucket with the help of a small vessel from a small pit
 narmada se sate yah chameli or sugat gaanv sardaar sarovar pariyojna ke sookhaa prabhavit gaanv hai, gramin bataate hai ki unke baap-dada isi tarah se peyajal ke liye dikkaton se jujhate aae hai
 After waiting for hours, barely two small cans get water
 adivaasiyon kaa aarope he ki sarkaar kaa unki taraf koi dhyaan nahin he
 In this fierce water crisis, the tribals of both villages struggle day and night to collect drinking water with the help of donkeys
 gaanv ke sarkari gram vikaas adhikari kaa kahana he ki raat 2 baje se pani jutaney kii kavayad main gramin apane gadhon ke saath nikalate hai or do se teen kilometre kaa safar tay karte hai
 Alam is that weddings in both villages are only formal as there is no water system for big events
 donon gaanv ke kareeb 180 parivaar raat teen baje se dopaher tak gadhe se pani dhone ke liye majaboor hote hai
 Due to the hilly terrain, it is helpless to arrange drinking water with the help of donkeys
 big bos ke is sijan main bahut kuch nayaa dekhne ko mil rahaa he
 Now a new twist has come on the show with Vikas Gupta trying to escape again

 He went out after hanging the jail
 big bos ne vikaas ko unki is harakat ke liye danta or vikaas ko kanpation room main bulaayaa
 But he was not in the mood to listen to anyone

 The powerful voice and speech that Atal Bihari Vajpayee had at the top of politics for more than 50 years now he became calm and he used to talk only by gestures

 Atal Bihari Vajpayee may have been lying silent in a government residence in Delhi, but his speeches and poems enthused BJP workers
 chunaavon main unki kavitaaon kaa istemaal jarur hota tha
 The most important thing about Atal ji's poems is that apart from politics and patriotism, the subject on which he wrote the most was 'death'
 aao man kii ganthe kholen Yamuna coast, mound sandy, ghaas-phoos kaa ghar handey par Cow dung in the courtyard tulsi kaa birwa, ghanti swar Ramayana from mother's mouth dohe-chaupai ras ghole Come, open the knots of the mind
 baba kii baithak main bichhi chataayee Put out pitches milane vaale ke man main asamanjas To go or not to go maathe tilak naak par ainak Speak openly aao man kii ganthe kholen
 Seeing Saraswati lakshmi ne sambandh na joda Mud sandalwood banane kaa sankalp na choda Receive new year tuk ruk len, kuch taaja ho len Come, open the knots of the mind
 aao phir se diya jalaaen Dark in the dark twilight suraj parchhaayi se haara Squeeze the innermost buji hui baati sulagaayein Let's light the lamp again
 ham padaav ko samajhen manzil Target lost sight vartmaan ke mohjaal main Don't forget tomorrow aao phir se diya jalaaen Sacrifice remaining incomplete apano ke vighnon ne gheraa Making the last hail thunderbolt nav dadhichi haddiyaan galaayen Come again, let me burn, i got angry with death, i did not intend to meet me on my mind, i did not stop my promise, but i stood up, so it became bigger than life, what is death? Not even two moments of life, today i am alive today, i will come out of my heart, why will i be scared from the feet, do not sneak away from stealth, then i will be completely oblivious to the freedom, every journey of life is beautiful The sound is not such that there is no sorrow, no pain, nothing less than love, i got so much from the strangers, i am not left with my own people

 rajamauli ne film 'bahubali' ke duusare bhaag kii relies ko ek saal se zyada samay hone ke baad aakhirkaar somvaar ko junior antiaar or ram charan ke saath apni agali telugu film kii yahaan shooting shuru kar di he
 The name of the film is yet to be decided
 philhal is project ko ararar kaha ja rahaa he, jisamen pehali baar junior antiaar or ram charan saath main kaam kar rahe hai
 Junior NTR and Ram Charan will be seen as brothers in the film with a budget of Rs 300 crore
 bharat or newjiland ke bich kheli ja rahi tii-20 siries 1-1 se barabari par he
 The third T-20 will decide who will be named in the series
 lekin duusare tii-20 main bharat kii haar ke baad ek nayaa sawaal khadaa ho gaya he
 That question is whether Mahendra Singh is made in the T20 team instead of Dhoni or not
 team main dhoni kii jagah par kai purv cricketron ne sawaal khadey kiye hai
 Former Indian player VVS Laxman believes that MS Dhoni replaces No
 4 in T20 as he should spend more time at the crease
 lekin duusare tii-20 match main jab kohli acchhee ballebaaji kar rahe the, to dhoni ko sirf kohli ko hi adhik strike deni chahie thi
 Laxman said that Kikohli's strike rate was 160, then Dhoni's only 80
 unhone kaha ki vanade team main to dhoni ek mahatvapurn hissaa hai lekin tii-20 main unhen yuva khilaadiyon ko mauka dena chahie
 On the other hand, Indian player Harbhajan Singh also said that the team needs to get a good start in the big chase, but Rohit and Shikhar Dhawan could not give a good start in the second T20
 gauratlab he ki duusare tii-20 main newjiland ne bharat ke saamne 197 ranon kaa lakshya diya tha
 India did not have a good start, 9
 1 over main hi bharat kaa score 67 par chaar tha
 During that time, India needed 130 runs from 65 balls
 lekin dhoni tej score karne main naakaam rahe the
 The dot ball was being played continuously by Dhoni, and the strike was also not rotating
 ek taraf dhoni strike rotate karne main naakaam ho rahe the to duusari taraf viraat kohli lagaataar lambey hit laga rahe the
 Kohli was scoring at a strike rate of around 150
 lekin kohli ko strike nahin mil paa rahi thi
 When Dhoni came to the crease, India wanted a run at a run rate of 12, but it went up later than 19
 haalanki, purv khilaadiyon se itar captain viraat kohli ne dhoni kaa bachaav kiya tha
 He had said that when a big goal has to be chased then the start should be good, every batsman should have scored runs
 kohli ne kaha tha ki dhoni ne ant main aakar acha pradarshan dikhaaya lekin ham log ant main kaaphi mushkil sthiti main aa gaye the
 Significantly, there has been a big change in the game of Mahendra Singh Dhoni from some time
 ab wo pehle vaala dhoni nahin dikhataa jo ki aate hi chauke-chakke maarna shuru kar den
 Now Dhoni takes some time after coming to the crease and later starts scoring fast runs
 duusare tii-20 main bhi aisa hi hua tha, shuru main dhoni thodaa stregal kar rahe the lekin baad main unhone bada score kiya
 He scored 49 runs in 37 balls
 ab dekhnaa ye he ki kya mahendra singh dhoni yaa phir team management koi bada ection lenge
 Because as Dhoni's age is increasing, such questions are bound to arise

 iftaar party main gaiyr-maujuudagi se shuru hua kayaason kaa daurabuudhvaar ko rahul gandhi kii iftaar party main samaajawaadee party ke kisi numaayinde ke nahin pahunchane se kayaason kaa daur shuru ho gaya
 The way in which Mayawati and the Congress are constantly getting closer, it is probably not liking Akhilesh Yadav
 karnataka ke mukhyamantri echdi kumaraswami ke shapath grahan main jis tareeke se basapa or congress ke netaaon kii body language va chemistry dikhi or phir madhya pradesh, rajasthan or chhattisgarh main bispi ke saath gathbandhan ko lekar congress kii gambhir charchaa hue, usko dekhte hue samaajawaadee party khud ko kinare mahasoos karne lagi he
 This is the reason why the Samajwadi Party has announced to contest all the seats in Madhya Pradesh
 upi main congress ke saath gathbandhan nahin chaahati sapaasmaajawaadee party uttar pradesh main congress ke saath gathbandhan nahin karnaa chaahati or uske netaa khulkar is baat kaa elaan bhi kar chuke hai
 Despite the Congress contesting the Gorakhpur and Phulpur Lok Sabha by-elections, the Samajwadi Party not only won the seats, but also forfeited the bail of the Congress
 aise main sapa ab upi main congress ke saath koi samjhauta nahin karnaa chaahati he
 On the other hand, Bahujan Samaj Party is constantly seen to be closely associated with Congress and this is the biggest headache for Samajwadi Party at the moment
 pichley loksabhaa chunaav main basapa kaa nahin khulaa tha khataupi main kul 80 sansadeey siten he
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP alliance won 73 seats in the Modi wave
 sapa ko paanch or congress ko do siten mili thi, jabaki basapa kaa khaataa bhi nahin khulaa tha
 Similarly, in the UP assembly elections held last year, the SP managed to win more seats than the BSP
 haalanki in chunaavon main donon partiyaan alag-alag chunaav ladi thi
 After this, SP was supported by BSP in phulpur-gorakhpur by-election
 iskaa nateeja yah hua ki bijepi ko karaari haar mili
 The relationship between the two parties has since strengthened
 yahi vajah he ki akhilesh yadav basapa kaa saath kisi bhi surat main chhodane ko taiyaar nahin he
 Mayawati continues to pressure Mayawati before the by-election, Mayawati announced not to tie up for not getting respectable seats, and then the way Akhilesh Yadav had agreed to become a junior partner in Uttar Pradesh, since then That Akhilesh Yadav is very angry about the alliance with the BSP, but Mayawati is currently keeping Akhilesh under constant pressure with his strict tricks
 kam siton kaa elaan sapa kaaryakartaaon ke gale nahin utrouttar pradesh ke siyaasi galiyaaron main is baat kii charchaa bahut tej he ki sapa or basapa gathbandhan ke bich sabakuch thik-thaak nahin he
 Mayawati does not want to contest less than 40 to 44 seats, while Akhilesh Yadav may agree to equal or 2-4 fewer seats, but the problem is not just the seats
 congress ke saath bhi ja sakati hai mayawativahin, congress philhal sadhe chaalon se uttar pradesh main mayawati ke saath apana bhavishya dekh rahi he
 In such a situation, the biggest concern of the Samajwadi Party is that Mayawati should not go with the Congress in the name of more seats
 isi ko bhaanpate hue akhilesh yadav ne chaar din pehle mainpuri main junior partner banane tak par apni sahmati de di thi
 On the one hand, the clean image of Akhilesh Yadav has been hit in the Bangla controversy, on the other hand, the proximity of Mayawati and Congress is also not good news for Akhilesh Yadav
 yahi vajah he ki apane tamaam pattey pehle kholane ke baad bhi akhilesh yadav par raajnneetik dabaav saaf dikhaai de rahaa he
 PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan says former England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) chief Giles Clarke is in favor of the resumption of the proposed bilateral series between India and Pakistan in December
 isibi adhyaksh bhi kar rahe hai prayasshehryaar ne pakistan or england ke bich chauthe vanade international cricket match se pehle kaha, ‘isibi ke purv chairman jailes clark bhi prayaas kar rahe hai or unka bhi maananaa he ki cricket ke hit main yah siries honi chahie

 PNB said- no final decision yet
 Jet Airways lenders are working for the revival of the airline, but no final decision has been taken yet
 punjab neshnal bank (pienbi) ke chairman evam prabandh nideshak sunil mehta ne mangalvaar ko yah baat kahi

 basapa-sapa nemadhya pradeshaurarajasthanvidhansabha chunaav mencongresske saath kisi tarah ke gathbandhan se inkaar kar diya he
 At the same time, the Congress is also looking at the politics of its future instead of bowing to these two parties under a thoughtful strategy
 yahi vajah he ki teenon rajyon main congress bina kisi gathbandhan ke siyaasi ranbhumi main bijepi se muqabla karne utari he
 Actually, there is a direct contest between BJP and Congress in these three states
 maujuuda samay main teenon rajyon main bijepi kii sarkarein hai or congress mukhya vipakshi dal he
 While the BSP has some basis, the SP does not exist
 aise main congress inke saath gathbandhan karke in dalon ko jaden jamaane kaa mauka nahin dena chaahati he
 That is why the Congress is not ready to bow down to them in relation to the alliance
 haalanki, congress chaahati thi ki vah basapa ke saath madhya pradesh aurachhattisgarhmen gathbandhan kare
 Negotiations were also going on between the leaders of both parties
 mayawati ne donon rajyon main itani zyada siton kii demand rakh di thi, jis par congress rajamand nahin ho saki
 According to sources, the Congress had offered 10 seats to the BSP and three to the SP in Madhya Pradesh
 iske alaava congress chhattisgarh main basapa ko 3 siten dena chaahati thi, jabaki mayawati 10 siten maang rahi thi
 a major reason behind the Congress giving less importance to the SP-BSP is that the last three assembly elections have not been able to show much effect in Madhya Pradesh
 basapa kaa aadhaar lagaataar ghatata ja rahaa he
 The BSP once had 11 mlas and 2 mps in Madhya Pradesh
 maujuuda samay main basapa mahaj vidhayakon par simat gai gai he
 The BSP fielded candidates for 227 seats in the 2013 assembly elections in Madhya Pradesh
 inamen se 194 siton par uski jamaanat jabt ho gai thi
 BSP 6
 42 fisadi vot ke saath mahaj chaar seat jeet saki thi
 At the same time, SP had fielded 164 candidates, out of which its bail was forfeited in 161 seats
 sapa ko mahaj 0
 It was 51 percent of the vote
 jabaki congress ko 36
 38 percent votes were received
 rajasthan main bhi basapa lagaataar kamjor hui he
 3 in 2013 assembly election
 4% vot ke saath basapa 3 siten jeet pai thi
 Whereas in 2008, the BSP won 6 seats with 7
 6 fisadi vot hasil kiye the
 SP 1 40 fisadi vot 2013 main mili the
 33 to Congress
 1% fisadi vot mili the
 bsp's vote share and seats have decreased in Chhattisgarh
 2013 ke vidhansabha chunaav main basapa 4
 Could win 1 seat with 5 percent votes
 jabaki isse pehle uske paas do vidhayak the
 Same as SP
 64 fisadi vot mili the
 Actually, the Congress is assuming that there is an anti-incumbency wave against the BJP in three states
 aise main iskaa sidhaa phayda sapa-basapa ke bajaay use milegaa
 In view of this, the Congress is not ready to bow down to the allies
 iske bajaay congress dalit, obisi or adivasee netaaon ko apane saath jodne kii ranneeti par kaam kar rahi he
 Congress strategists are also assuming that if the SP-BSP was given more seats in the assembly elections, then they will keep a big demand for the Lok Sabha elections
 iske alaava teenon rajya kii siyaasi jang congress fatah karti he to desh main uske paksh main maahaul banegaa
 After this, the opposition parties will compromise on their own terms and it will become a compulsion to listen to the allies
 haalanki congress ko puri ummid he ki agle saal hone vaale 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav se pehle mahagathbandhan khadaa hoga or upi ke donon pramukh dal iskaa hissaa honge

 hamaari pramukh ichha loksabhaa chunaav main vipaksh ko ekajute dekhne kii he or hamen ummid he ki is lakshya ko praapt kar lenge
 It is believed that SP and BSP will be part of this grand alliance

 In the past, six states of the country including Jharkhand were declared Open Defecation Free (ODF) by Union Minister Hardeep Singh Puri
 hardip singh puri ke mutabik in rajyon ne mahaj teen saal ke bheetar shahari kshetro main ODF kaa shat-pratishat lakshya hasil kar liya he, lekin kya yah daawa vastav main jamini sachai he yaa phir yah aankadon kii baazeegari kar mahaj lakshya puraa karne kaa dikhaava
 The truth of this matter is examined by some big cities of Jharkhand, who have been declared as free of charge (ODF)
 ranchi main hi nirmaan adhuraasarkaarake daavon kii maane to shahar ke har gharon main shauchalay kaa nirmaan ho chukaa he, lekin baangi ke taur par jharkhand rajdhani ranchi ke ward sankhya 53 kaa nayakatoli mohalle kaa haal bhi bahut kharaab he or yahaan se jharkhand vidhansabha se isaki duuri mahaj 5 kilometre or rajya sachivalay jahaan bade naukarshah baithte hai vahaan se isaki duuri lagbhag 3 kilometre he
 But the condition here is very bad
 ab sarkaar ke daavon kii maane to yahaan sabhi ke ghar main shauchalay he
 No person defecates in the open, but the reality of this claim is found on coming here
 sthaneey log bataate hai ki hamaare ilaake main shauchalay kaa nirmaan shuru to jarur hua, lekin shauchalayon kaa nirmaan thekedaron ko saunp diya gaya
 Those who left the city after half-done

 Ramgarh, the first district of Jharkhand to be declared open defecation free
 ise sarkaar ne beete saal teen april ko ODF jila ghoshit kiya tha
 It was then claimed that the target has been achieved by constructing 77,701 toilets during 2016-17, but today only 50 percent of the toilets are being used
 baaki shauchalay pani kii killat kii vajah se band pade hai
 For the construction of every toilet, a grant of 12 thousand is given by the government, but people allege that most of the contractors overheated their pockets, but here too it was closed due to lack of water and half-incomplete construction
 Are lying duusari taraf rajya ke mukhyamantri raghuvar das kaa kahana he ki ab centre or rajya main bijepi sarkaron ke baad shahari kshetron ke nikaay chunaav main bhi party ko jeet mili he, aise main ab vikaas kaa kaary gati pakadega

 This law only gives the right to recover money
 yahi vajah he ki sarkaar kii ore se abhi bhi aadhikarik rup se lalit modi ko 'bhagoda' ghoshit nahin kiya ja sakaa he
 This situation has been going on since the tenure of the UPA government
 bataa den ki vipakshi dal congress ne sarkaar par yahi aarope lagaae hai ki unki ek mantri or ek rajya kii mukhyamantri ek 'bhagode' kii madad ke aarope main sanlipt hai or isliye unhen apane apane padon se istipha de dena chahie

 sutron kaa kahana he ki ab sarkaar inhen aaropon ko aadhaar banaakar lalit modi par nai dhaaraon ke tahat cese darj karegi taaki us par shikanja ksaa ja sake
 It is believed in this episode that the government will now file a case of money laundering on Lalit Modi so that an arrest order can be taken against him from the court and then according to international laws, Lalit Modi can be brought to India and the legal process can be taken forward Can go sutara bataa rahe hai ki purvavarti sarkaar kii inhen khaamiyon ko dur karne ke liye narendra modi sarkaar kanoon main bhi nae badlaav karne kaa man bana rahi he taaki bhavishya main aise maamalon ko sakhti se nibata ja sakate

 or bayaan main yah bhi kaha gaya he ki varisht netaaon se milane ke liye mukhyamantri dilli nahin ja rahi hai
 Highly placed sources in the government say that the government believes that all the cases that have been registered against Lalit Modi during the upa's Manmohan Singh government are under FEMA and no one should be arrested under this law
 Can
 yah kanoon sirf paisa vasuuli tak kaa adhikaar detaa he
 This is the reason why the government has still not officially declared Lalit Modi a 'fugitive'
 yah sthiti upie kii sarkaar ke kaarykaal se chali aa rahi he
 Explain that the opposition Congress has made the same allegations on the government that one of its ministers and the chief minister of a state are involved in the charge of helping a 'fugitive' and hence they should resign from their posts
 sutara yah bhi bataa rahe hai ki lalit modi ke khilaaf ab tak ke sabase gambhir aarope bisisiai kii us samiti kii ore se lagaae gaye hai jisaki adhyakshata arun jetali ne kii thi
 Sources say that now on the basis of these allegations, the government will file a case against Lalit Modi under the new sections so that it can be tightened
 isi kadi main mana ja rahaa he ki sarkaar ab lalit modi par mani londring kaa cese darj karegi taaki court se uske khilaaf giraftaar kaa aadesh liya ja sake or phir antarrashtriya kanoonon ke hisaab se lalit modi ko bharat laayaa ja sake or kanoonee prakriya ko aage badhaayaa ja sake
 Sources are telling that in order to remove these shortcomings of the previous government, the Narendra Modi government is also planning to make new changes in the law so that such cases can be dealt with strictly in future
 tippaniyan Raje, who led the BJP to a landslide victory in the Rajasthan assembly elections 2013 and played a major role in the party's win in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, said that the news being broadcast by some channels is far from the truth

 bharat ke kanoonee maamalon main adaalatein bhartiya dand samhita ke tahat karrwai karti hai
 But this did not happen in Jammu and Kashmir
 vahaan bhartiya dand samhita yani IPC kaa prayog nahin hota tha
 But after the removal of Section 370, now the IPC will be applicable in Jammu and Kashmir like the entire country
 ab yahaan yah samajhane kii zarurat he ki aakhir ranbir dand samhita thi kya?kya thi ranbir dand samhitabharat ke jammu kashmir rajya main ranbir dand samhita lagu thi
 Also known as Ranbir Code of Conduct
 bhartiya samvidhan kii dhara 370 ke mutabik jammu kashmir rajya main bhartiya dand samhita kaa istemaal nahin kiya ja saktaa tha
 Only the Ranbir Penal Code was used here
 british kaal se hi is rajya main ranbir dand samhita lagu thi
 Actually, Jammu and Kashmir was an independent princely state before India became independent
 us vakt jammu kashmir main dogra rajvansh kaa shashan tha
 Maharaja Ranbir Singh was the ruler there
 isliye vahaan 1932 main maharaja ke naam par ranbir dand samhita lagu kii gai thi
 This code was similar to Thomas Babinton Macaulay's Indian Penal Code
 lekin isaki kuch dhaaraon main antar tha
 Ranbir was not in the Penal Code
 These laws, Section 4 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), address and address crimes committed through computers, but there is no mention in the Ranbir Penal Code
 ipisi kii dhara 153 CAA ke tahat saarvajanik sabhaaon yaa jamaavadon ke dauraan jaan boojhkar shastr laane ko dandaneey aparaadh mana jaataa he, jabaki ranbir dand samhita main is mahatvapurn vishay kaa ullekh nahin he
 Under Section 195A of the IPC, if someone tortures someone for giving false testimony or statement, then he is considered to be entitled to punishment, whereas there is no instruction in this regard in the Ranbir Penal Code
 ipisi kii dhara 281 ke tahat jo vyakti kisi navikon ko prakaash, nishaan yaa perak main kaam aane vaale pahiyon se gumraah karata he, to vah sajaa kaa hakdaar he, jabaki ranbir dand samhita main aisa kuch nahin he
 Section 304B of the Indian Penal Code deals with deaths due to dowry, but is not mentioned in the Ranbir Penal Code
 ranbir dand samhita kii dhara 190 ke tahat sarkaar aise kisi bhi vyakti ko sazaa de sakati he, jo sarkaar dwaara amaanya yaa jabt kii gai saamagree kaa prakaashan yaa vitaran karata he
 In this case the Chief Minister has the right to determine the crime
 yah vishesh dhara patrakarita, soch, vichaar or abhivyakti kii swatantraaa ko buree tarah se prabhavit karti he
 These laws are not in the IPC
 According to Section 167A of the Bir Penal Code, any government employee who accepts payment of any contractor for the work of commission is entitled to legal punishment
 rishwatakhori se judi yah mahatvapurn dhara ipisi main maujuud nahin he
 Under Section 420A of the Ranbir Penal Code, the government, competent authorities or authorities determine the punishment for fraud or fraud that may occur in any settlement
 aisa spasht vyakaran ipisi main nahin he
 Section 204A of the Ranbir Penal Code clearly sets out the punishment for erasing or distorting evidence
 is vishay par aisa spashtikaran ipisi main nahin he
 Section 21 of the Ranbir Penal Code lays down the scope of public employment while in the Indian Penal Code its scope is limited

 3 on 14th February to Pulwama on Jammu and Kashmir Highway
 10 baje aatmghaatee aatanki hamale ne dahala diya
 The video of Adil Ahmed Dar, who carried out the attack, was revealed within half an hour
 video ko jari karne kii timming is tarah thi ki wo tezi se viral hokar zyada se zyada logon tak pahunch sake
 All this happened at a time when India, shocked by the terror attack, was engaged in collecting the dead bodies of the martyred soldiers of the Pulwama attack from the smoke of black smoke
 ghati main tej hawa ke dauraan shoot hua aatanki kaa video, lekin aatmghaatee hamale ko anjaam dene vaale daar kaa video kisi gufa, jangal yaa kisi shahari maleen basti kii main nahin filmaaya gaya tha
 a special forensic analysis by India Today revealed that the video of Dar was shot in the midst of the walls of the makeshift Terror Studios in the Kashmir Valley battling the high winds
 bhartiya media ke liye apni tarah kii is pehali jaanch main clip kii baarik se baarik awaz ko bhi pakadaa gaya
 Hitech tools and sensors were used for this
 baarik audio se mili ahm suragodio weveforms jinhen maanav kaan sunne main sakasham nahin he, unhen atyaadhunik upkarnon ke zarie process kiya gaya
 They immediately indicated that when this footage of Dar was recorded, the suicide bomber was not far from Pulwama
 hitech tuls ne anokhe Acoustic signatures (dhvanik sanketak) pakade jinke jariye india today kii open-sorce team ko daar ke video ko shoot karne vaali jagah kii pahchaan karne main madad mili
 Every kind of sound that was present while recording the footage, including knocking on the door, strong wind running outside, was captured through sophisticated gadgets
 inase taarkik taur par ye nirnay tak pahunchane main madad mili kii pulavama suicide bombar kaa video khuli jagah main filmaaya gaya tha
 Forensic tests captured at least 21 nuances related to sound, each of which was unique in its own way
 upkarnon se hawaaon se darwaazon ke hilne tak kii awaz kii pahchaan hui
 This voice was not coming continuously which ruled out the possibility of presence of an electric fan there
 isaki jagah ye awaz aisi thi ki jaise baahar ruuk ruuk kar hawa chal rahi he
 Filtering audio streams also revealed a lack of coordination between audio and video
 isse sanket miltaa he ki footage kii recording ke baad dabing kii gai
 Jem used the free edit app
 Metadata beneath the video's surfaces shows that the footage was edited through a free version of the app called Kinemaster
 footage ko filmaane vaali jaish kii tech team ne jaanboojhkar ap ke premium vairient ko nahin istemaal kiya jisase ki tranjection trail main iske prints se bachaa ja sake
 The terrorist who carried out the attack was not alone
 The video of Dar, a 20-year-old suicide terrorist, indicates that Dar was not alone in carrying out the Pulwama attack as Pakistan is trying to show
 india today kii state-of-da-art jaanch ne sthapit kiya ki jaish-e-mohammad ne daar ke teror video ko filmaane ke liye uski madad ko technology exparts kii team tainaat kii thi
 Forensic analysis revealed that the footage was shot on a solid surface via cell-phone
 jis divaais se shoot kiya gaya use koi or handle kar rahaa tha
 Obtaining the instructions of others Pulwama terrorist India Today's forensic inspection also revealed that Dar read his message from a pre-prepared script which was placed in front of him at a distance of five feet from a mobile camera at eye-height
 certyphoid vwayahaar vishleshak or manovigyaani dow kapil kakkar ne clip main aatankwaadi kii body language or bolne ke dhang ke aadhaar par india today kii jaanch ke nishkarshon kii pushti kii
 Dr
 Kakkar says that when he starts making his statement it seems that he is reading it from somewhere else
 dow kakkar spasht karte hai, “vahaan camera or camere ke peeche kuch log daar ke daaen or baayen khadey hai
 He is taking their consent
 uski ankhen idhar se udhar hoti rahati hai
 No harmony in voice and gesture The forensic experts of India Today also closely captured the gestures of the terrorist
 jaanch se saamne aayaa ki aatanki ke haavbhaavon or uski awaz main talmail nahin tha
 In the 10-minute jihadi tape, there is no expression on the face of the terrorist
 aatanki jab apane jivan ke kathith baad ke bare main baat karata he to uske cheharaa bhavashunya rahata he
 Dr
 Kakkar says that it is clear from the body language of the suicide bomber that he was following the instructions of his handlers
 dow kakkar kehete hai, “uske haathon ke movement dekho
 Look at her facial expressions
 unka aapas main koi talmail nahin he
 If we look at his entire body language, the flow of voice, the ups and downs, the level of emotion, everything shows that he was following the instructions of others

 Asked why he does not promote his films on TV as compared to other actors
 iske jawaab main aamir ne samvaadadaataaon ko bataaya, "main maanata hum ki tivi ek bahut bada madhyam he lekin main tivi sho main jaakar filmon kaa prachaar karne main vishwaas nahin karata
 There are two ways of marketing, the first is to make people aware of the film and the second is the trailer of the film

 It will make a difference, but yes, the difference that had to be made is within a week or two of the beginning

 com / juwn6uchxo — COLORS (@colorstv) October 1, 2019 Why did Punjabi singer Shehnaz Gill cry bitterly on the second day of the show? After this, there is a fight between Siddharth Shukla and Siddharth Dey over food
 yah ladaai yaheen nahin thami
 At the end of the ration of the house in just two days, all the householders target Shahnaz and Paras, because Shahnaz and Paras have the responsibility to manage the ration
 paras to apni safai main gharavaalon ko rashan bachaane kaa idia de dete hai
 But Shehnaz says that she cannot take the responsibility of ration, she does not understand all this
 sabhi log shahanaz ko samajhane kii koshish karte hai, lekin wo sabase pareshaan hokar foot-foot kar rone lagati hai
 They have a corpse they are taking to the crematorium

 The Ram temple issue cannot be brought alive under any circumstances
 ’’ falahari baba ke naam se mashhoor mahant kaushal kishor sharan ayodhya main rajagopal mandir se thodi dur sthit ram janmabhumi parisar kii ore ishaara karte hue do took kehete hai
 Wearing Tripund, Dhawal Beard, Dhoti and Janeu on his forehead, this Baba has a well-known appearance in Hindu society
 150 saal puraane unke mandir ke neeche sadak par sawan meley kii dhooma vaali ayodhya main hajaaron shraddhaluon kii bheed dol rahi he, is mandir se us mandir
 People have flocked to Ayodhya from nearby dozen districts
 sir par potli, ek haath main jhola, duusare main kisi bachche kaa haath
 Minor clothes on the body
 man main ram naam hoga, lekin jabaan par ‘‘jai shri ram’’ nahin he
 After the demolition of Babri Masjid, the then Prime Minister P
 ve
 Falahari Baba, who was the leader of the sages who chanted Narasimha Rao, is again in a rage after a long time, "do not understand what is the point of raising the issue of 84 Kosi Parikrama at this time?" Anyway, this journey is done by saints and ascetics, what is the work of common people in it? And this journey takes place from Chautra Purnima to Baishakh Purnima, so much chaos on it in the monsoon! Why? ”he fears that the real motive behind all this commotion is to bring Ayodhya once again to the center of politics before the Lok Sabha elections in May next year
 ayodhya ko sampradayik raajnneeti kaa centre banane kaa virodh unke jaise soch ke sant hi kar rahe hon, aisa nahin he
 Now the common man also wants to keep himself away from this "mess"
 aap jaise-jaise ayodhya ke andar paithte jate hai, yah ehsaas badhata jaataa he ki mandir-masjid vivaad ne ayodhya kaa chaun chin liya he
 Congress MP from Faizabad like Nirmal Khatri testifies, "ever since the Babri Masjid demolition, Ayodhya has become a desolate city
 yahaan ke log kabhi sampradayik nahin rahe
 Whatever movements were launched, they were run on the strength of outsiders
 ’’ falahari baba kii tarah pradesh congress adhyaksh khatri ko bhi lagata he ki ab ayodhya main mandir ke naam par koi andolan khadaa nahin ho saktaa
 But once again the movement has increased
 ram ke naam par na sahi, 84 kosi parikrama yatra ke naam par sahi
 The tension in the city of Dharma is increasing 10 km ahead of Faizabad
 At the entrance there is a chaupi of Ramcharit Manas written: Pravici nagar kijai sab kaja, Hriday Rashi Kausalpur Raja
 bas, ab ayodhya shuru
 The things that grab your attention as soon as they enter are the crowds of devotees of ordinary Mali condition, shops of worship on both sides of the road, queues of houses temples, police barricades in place and gunmen on every corner
 pravesh dwaar ke baad tamaam sadaken hajaaron mandiron kii ore rasta banaati hai to bairicads vaali mukhya sadak vivaadit sthal kii ore chali jaati he
 People now call that place the birthplace
 yahaan ke thane kaa naam bhi ram janmabhumi thana rakh diya gaya he
 The Babri Masjid place is being deliberately taken out of mind
 kareeb 77 acre kaa puraa parisar pile paint se puti salaakhon or contile taron kii baad se ghira he
 This is the birthplace for devotees and the "yellow zone" for security personnel
 uttar pradesh police, piesi or siarpief ke 2,500 javaanon kii teen str kii suraksha ke bich yahi vah jagah he, jahaan ramalala virajman hai or jahaan 6 disambar, 1992 tak babari masjid astitv main thi
 The policemen who came under the protection of Sawhney Fair were confident that their duty would be completed from here on completion of the fair on Raksha Bandhan
 tabhi 84 kosi parikrama ke mudde ne tool pakad liya
 Additional i PAC companies were held here indefinitely for the fair
 saare pulisavaalon kii chhuttiyaan radd kar di gayi
 VHP has been adamant on taking this journey since 25 August
 lekin uttar pradesh kii akhilesh yadav sarkaar ne sakht rukh apanaate hue kisi bhi keemat par yatra ko manjuuri dene se inkaar kar diya he
 The district administration has now appealed to the monks from outside to return to their respective dhams
 lekin chaturaai ke saath yah bhi jod diya he ki dharmik kaaryakramon par koi pratibandh nahin he
 The government is in a hurry, that is why it has asked the administration to arrange temporary jails here
 sakriyata bhagava kheme main bhi kam nahin he
 The VHP has also alerted activists of the surrounding districts
 sanghathan ke mahaamantri chanpat raay ayodhya main deraa daale hue hai
 vhp's aged lion Ashok Singhal would also have been here but could not come due to mourning in the family
 sanghathan ne kham thoka he ki kisi main himmat ho to yatra rokkar dikhaae
 Then the same language and tone, as it used to be in the late 1980s: child-to-child Ram's, the birthplace's work
 30 aktubar, 1990 ko ayodhya main car sevakon par goli chalane kii ghatana ke samay ayodhya se janata dal vidhayak rahe or ab sapa sarkaar main rajyamantri jaishankar pandey ‘‘faij’’ ahamed faij kii shaayari kii kitaab ko mej par rakhte hue raay dete haih ‘‘tab (laalkrishna) adwani kii ghudchadhi kii taiyaari thi
 Now! There is a need to bring Modi to Delhi

 Today, when the SP is taking Ayodhya on the path of development, a snake is rolling on its chest
 ’’ unhone paanch baar se lagaataar ayodhya seat se jitate rahe bijepi ke lallu singh ko pichley vidhansabha chunaav main karaari maat di
 In such a situation, there is also a reason for his anger
 ‘‘jab ye ayodhya tak haar baithe to kis munh se sampradayik muddon ko uthaanaa chaahate hai? sari khuraafaat ayodhya ko phir se hasil karne ke liye ho rahi he

 Going back, Narendra Modi's special in-charge Amit Shah, who was made BJP in-charge of Uttar Pradesh, visited Ayodhya two months ago
 shah ne dhire se surasuri chhod di ki ram mandir kaa nirmaan hona chahie
 After this, he returned to his election work
 or baaki kaa kaam viechpi ke jimme chhod diya
 On the other hand, his political guru Narendra Modi overtook Amit Shah
 ek taraf ashok singhl ko lag rahaa he ki narendra modi ke andar bhagwaan ram kii shakti pravesh kar gai he taaki ram mandir kaa nirmaan ho sake, duusari taraf modi is mudde par aise maun hai jaise mahadev ne samadhi laga lee ho
 Modi himself has been emphasizing on development and he has left the work of carrying his communal sedan on members of the family like VHP

 The BJP, which ran an absolute majority government in Uttar Pradesh before the fall of the mosque, found nothing other than sitting in opposition or running a manipulative government after the mosque collapsed
 aise main agar 84 kos parikrama kaa andolan phuss ho bhi jaae to bijepi ke taaranhar modi ko kam se kam khud to badanaami nahin jhelni padegi
 That is why VHP workers are intent on continuing the yatra from 25 August to 13 September
 unhone parikrama main har roj shaamil hone ke liye santon kii kam se kam 250 team bana di hai or giraftaar se bachane ke liye underground ho gaye hai
 a VHP leader said, "if one team gets arrested, the other team will continue the parikrama
 sarkaar hamen roak nahin paaegi
 "they have distributed pamphlets, according to which, the saints of Kanpur and Jaipur will start their circumambulation from the Saryu river in Ayodhya in the morning on August 25 and reach Basti district by evening

 The flag march of security forces has also been started in Ayodhya city so that the enthusiasm of the people remains cool

 Progress was made in the rest of the country, but Ayodhya got permanent tension
 na sadaken sudharin, na rojgaar ke koi nae maukey
 That is why this city has become a moving picture of poverty in India

 After the resignation of Computer Baba from the post of Minister of State, it is now believed that he can be vocal about the Narmada scam
 unhone istife dene ke saath jis tarah ke tevar akhriyaar kiye hai
 It is clear from him that the genie of Narmada scam can once again come out
 computer baba ne kaha, 'main goraksha, narmada sangrakshan, math-mandiron ke hiton main kaam karnaa chahta tha, magar aisa karne main asafal rahaa

 barish se baadhit is mukaable main bharat ke liye pehla gol uske star striker sunil chhetri ne pehle half ke atirikt samay main khel ke 45wein minute main kiya
 In the first half, the Syrian team made several attacks one after the other, but goalkeeper Subrata Pal defended them brilliantly
 pehle half main barish ke kaaran khel kuch der ke liye rokna bhi padaa
 In the second half, India adopted an attacking approach and made several attempts to score goals but the second breakthrough came in the 84th minute of the game when Anthony Perera fired a long shot from the Syrian players who went straight into the goalpost
 syria kii ore se pehla or ekmaatr gol alaa al shibali ne khel ke 91wein minute main kiya
 Thus India defeated Syria 2–1 in this first match
 fifa ranking main bharat kaa 168waan sthaan he jabaki syria ko 147waan sthaan hasil he
 India won the title in 2007 and 2009
 maje kii baat yah he ki bharat ne final muqablon main syria ko hi haraakar donon baar khitaab hasil kiya tha

 nitish kumaar patna main janata dal united ke daftar main sadsyta abhiyaan kii shuruyaat karne ke baad ek samvaadadaata sammelan main bol rahe the
 When asked questions on the issue of Prashant Kishore, he said that on Sunday, Prashant Kishore would come to attend the meeting of the National Executive and he would tell about it
 haalanki unhone mana ki jo bhi party kaa kaary unke zimme hai usamen abhi tak party ko diqqat nahin ai he
 Nitish Kumar admitted that Prashant Kishore has his own identity as a political strategist and he has connections with all people
 haalanki janata dal united (JDU) kaa anya dalon ke liye unki company dwaara kiye jane vaale kaaryon se koi lenaa dena nahin hota he
 Nitish Kumar admitted that a lot of questions are being raised in the media ever since it came to take care of the Trinamool Congress
 is mudde par media main kanfusion kii sthiti bhi bani he
 Although he says that when he was handling the work of YSR Congress in Andhra Pradesh, in which he has got huge success, then no one discussed it, but people have suddenly noticed in this regard
 nishchit rup se nitish kaa ishaara is baat ko lekar tha ki bengal main trinmul congress or BJP donon aamane saamne hai
 In Bihar, he is running the government with the help of BJP, so people are questioning this issue more
 iske baad nitish kumaar ne kaha ki ham kuch nahin kah sakate, kyonki prashanth kishor swayan is bare main explene kar denge ki unki kya soch he
 But the party has no relation with all these things and it is not to my knowledge
 bataa den kisaal 2014 ke aam chunaav main pradhanmantri narendra modi ke mukhya chunavi ranneetikaar rahe prashanth kishor ne andhra pradesh main jagmohan reddy ke netritv vaali wiesar congress kii 'tsunami jeet' main ahm bhoomika nibhaate hue phir se 'apane bijness' main joardaar vaapasi kii thi
 Prashant Kishore's strategy drove out Chandrababu Naidu, who was leading the Third Front a few days before the general election results
 prashanth kishor ne saal 2017 main uttar pradesh main hue chunaav main congress ke liye ranneeti taiyaar kii thi, lekin tab is chunaav main congress ko buree tarah munh kii khaani padi thi
 Let me tell you that Nitish Kumar hardly gave any major responsibility to this election to Prashant Kishore, vice president of JDU, the ruling party of Bihar
 iske peeche vajah rahi ki nitish kumaar par sahyogi party bijepi ke dabaav main the
 The BJP was angry at Prashant Kishore's plan to expand JDU among the youth
 is par nitish kumaar ne bijepi kii asahajata ko teji se samajhate hue uski chintaa kii andekhi karne ke bajaay apane upaadhyaksh prashanth kishor ko hi kinare karne kaa faisla liya
 During the festive season, Bihar's former Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has lashed out at the central government over the plight of passengers in trains going to Bihar
 unhone rail mantralay ko nikamma tehraaya he
 Nitish Kumar has alleged that the Modi government is against Bihar
 nai dilli: train main chadhane ke dauraan gira yuvak, mautanitish kumaar ne fasebuk ek post likh kar chhath ko lekar rail mantralay kii taiyaariyon par sawaal uthaae
 He also demanded compensation for the person killed in an accident while boarding a train at New Delhi station on Saturday
 nitish kumaar kaa post
 
 
 The central government is against Bihar, the Ministry of Railways is ineffective
 1
 Due to mismanagement of the poor government at the center, the people of Bihar are not able to celebrate Chhath's mahaparva with respect
 2
 Like sheep and goats, people are forced to walk on the rail, traveling in the toilet despite paying full fare
 3
 Shame on the Railway Ministry, that due to their mismanagement, people lost their lives if someone's leg was cut? Our demand is 1
 rail mantri bihar ke logon se maafi maange, karrwai karen
 2
 mritkon ke parivaar ko muaavja va railway main naukari mili, ghayalon kaa upachaar ho or muaavja mili
 3
 jin yatriyon ko tikat ke anusaar suvidha nahin mili unhen puure paise lautaae jaaen
 JDU will fight for the honor and faith of the people of Bihar until justice is found
 aapako bataa den ki chhath parv ke maddenjar nai dilli, mumbai or anya bade shaharon se bihar jane ke liye yatriyon ke kaaran railway steshnon par baari bheed dekhne ko mil rahi he
 The condition is so bad that passengers are forced to travel in the toilet of the train
 jin logon ke paas canform tikat hai, unhen seat nahin mil paa rahi
 Salaried women pay less tax than their male colleagues
 isaki vajah yah he ki mahilaon ke liye kar bhugtan kaa slab jahaan purushon kii tulana main ooncha he, vahiin ve nivesh karne ke maamle main purushon se aage hai
 The 'india Tax Ratio 2011' report of the online income tax return portal Tax Spanner states that the average tax ratio of salaried women in major Indian cities is 4 percent, while in the case of men it is 6 percent
 kar anupaat kaa matlab he aamadani ke hisaab se kar kaa hissaa
 The report said that 76 percent women have a tax ratio of less than 5 percent, while in the case of salaried men this figure is 59 percent
 yahaan kar anupaat se taatpary vetan kaa vah bhaag he, jo kar ke rup main adaa kiya jaataa he
 The study covers employees of around 500 companies in Delhi NCR, Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore and Hyderabad
 mahilaon ke kam kar adaa karne kii vajah yah he ki unke liye iskar chhot kii seemaa kahin oonchi 1
 90 lakhs
 iske alaava adhyayan main yah baat bhi saamne ai he ki mahilaayein awaas kiraaya bhatte kaa daawa karne tathaa swasthya kharch ke tahat katautee lene ke maamle main purushon se behatar hai
 The report states that Chennai and Delhi NCR have the lowest average tax ratio of 5 percent among major metro cities
 mumbai or hyderabad main yah 6 pratishat or bangalore main 7 fisad he
 Interestingly, salaries of salaried people in Mumbai are 40 percent higher on average than those in Chennai and Delhi NCR
 adhyayan main kaha gaya he ki 5 lakh rupee salanaa tak kamaane vaale vetanbhogiyon main makaan maalikon kaa ausat kar anupaat 2 pratishat he, jabaki jinke paas makaan nahin he unke liye yah 5 pratishat baithta he
 Among those whose annual income is up to Rs 10 lakh, the average tax ratio is 12 percent for landlords and 15 percent for non-homeowners
 tex spanner kaa kahana he ki karmchaaree awaas rin ke tahat milane vaali chhot kaa phayda uthaakar kar bachaa sakate hai
 The report says that only 6 of those whose income is less than Rs 5 lakh per annum
 8 pratishat logon ke paas apana ghar he
 This shows that very few people consider buying a house a better investment option
