 ab jaakar pataa chalaa he ki is yuddh ke peeche china kii manshaa kya thi
 Maotsse Tung, the late Chinese strongman, waged a 1962 war with India to regain control of the ruling Communist Party after the failure of the 'great Leap Forward' movement
 china ke ek sheersh ranneetikaar wang jisi ne kiya he
 On Saturday, on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the war, he introduced a new aspect of the war
 china kii peking univarsity ke skool aaf international studies ke dean evam china ke videsh mantralay kii videsh niti salaahkaar samiti ke sadsy wang jisi ne kaha, ‘yuddh ek dukhad ghatana thi
 That was not necessary
 ’ unhone kaha ki unki dharna china ke kai raajnneetik evam ranneetik vishleshkon se alag he ki china kii jeet ne bharat ke seemaa par daawey ko samaapt kar diya or isse dirghakaalik shanti sthapit hui
 According to Indian diplomats, the Chinese leadership used to consult Jissi many times
 jisi ne kaha, ‘meraa maananaa he ki hamen kuch anusandhan karnaa chahie
 i have heard an anecdote that it was because of Maotsse Tung's fear of his position in China that he started the 1962 war
 ’unhone kaha, ‘saal 1962 main great lip forward (jielef) ke baad maotse ne satta or praadhikaar kho diya
 He was no longer the head of the country and he moved to the so-called second line
 hamen us samay jo spashtikaran diya gaya vah yah tha ki unki kranti or anya chizon main adhik ruchi he
 The Great Leap Forward (GLF) was a mass campaign that Maotse Tung began using the vast population of China to transform the country from an agrarian economy to a modern communist society
 yah andolan china ko barbaad karne vaala sabit hua kyonki lakhon log hinsa kii bhent chadh gaye
 This weakened Maotse's position as the supreme leader of the country's ruling Communist Party of China (CPC)
 wang jisi ne kaha, ‘swaabhaavik rup se unhone (maotse) ne kai vyaavhaarik muddon par se niyantran kho diya
 So he wanted to prove that he was still in power, especially the control of the army
 isliye unhone tibet ke commander ko bulaayaa or jhang se poocha ki kya aap is baat kaa bharosa he ki aap bharat ke saath yuddh jeet sakate hai
 'zhang Guohua was the then PLA commander of the Tibet Regiment
 wang jisi ke anusaar, ‘commander ne kaha, ‘haa maotse, ham yuddh aasaani se jeet sakate hai
 He said, 'go ahead and do it
 ’ iskaa uddeshy yah pradarshit karnaa tha ki sena par unka vyaktigat niyantran he
 So it had very little to do with the border dispute (maybe from Tibet but not necessarily)
 ’ The incessant rains in Uttarakhand have increased the problems of people living in the mountains of Uttarakhand
 jahaan maidaanon main barish kaa pani rihaayshi ilaakon main ghus rahaa he to vahiin nadi naale apane puure ufaan par hai
 The continuous rains in Uttarakhand have absorbed many lives so far
 chamoli main ek baar phir badal ne apana kahar barapaaya he
 Clouds burst near Joshimath Malari Road, causing tremendous damage
 4 logon ko apni jaan se haath dhonaa padaa or 2 abhi bhi laapata hai
 Among the dead is a child
 rescue team kaa search aaparishan abhi bhi jari he
 In the same incident, the BRO workers' camp has suffered heavy losses
 bataa den ki monsoon kaa sabase zyada asar pahaado par dekhne ko mil rahaa he
 Everyday reports of landslides are increasing in the mountains
 nadiyaan apane puure ufaan par hai
 Alaknanda's water level is above the danger mark for the first time since 2013
 haridwar main bhi ganga ne kai ghaaton ko apane agosh main le liya he
 Talking about the mountains, the worst situation is in the areas around Chamoli, Uttarkashi, Bageshwar and Yamunotri Dham, where there are frequent incidents of cloudburst
 sthaneey jan-jivan ast-vyast ho chukaa he
 People are forced to live under the shadow of terror
 yamunotri dham ko jodne vaala ekmaatr paidal rasta puri tarah barbaad ho chukaa he
 Yamnotri's journey is blocked due to recent blast
 yahi haal chamoli jile kaa he, jahaan alag-alag jagahon par badal fatne kii ghatana hui hai
 Due to which there is an atmosphere of panic once again
 haal hi main chamoli jile ke ghat main badal fata jisase awajahi ke tamaam raste samaapt ho chuke hai or skool ke bachche khatarnaak raaston se skool jane ko majaboor ho chuke hai
 Many vehicles were hit in this incident and many houses have been damaged
 mausam vibhagaki maane to halaat jaldi se saamaanya hone vaale nahin hai
 Because the rain of Uttarakhand is not going to stop
 aise main halaat or bhi gambhir ho sakate hai
 Because of this people living here need to be more vigilant, so that a big accident can be avoided in future
 pradhanmantri pad ke liye rahul gandhi kii pairvi karte aa rahe congress ke mahasachiv digvijay singh ne ravivaar ko kaha ki gandhi parivaar kaa yah yuva netaa ab itnaa paripakv ho chukaa he ki vah desh ke is sheersh raajnneetik pad ko sambhaal sake
 Digvijay said, Rahul has turned 40 and he has been working for the party for the last seven-eight years
 vah paripakv ho gaye hai or unke andar sahi jigyaasu raajnneetik pravritiyaan hai
 He said that Rahul has all the qualities and experience of becoming Prime Minister and now he is ready to assume the responsibility of this post
 haalanki, is bare main antim faisla rahul ko hi khud lenaa hoga
 While denying the allegations of appeasement of minorities on himself, the Congress General Secretary said that he had taken action against both Bajrang Dal and SIMI when he was the Chief Minister
 unhone kaha ki jab madhyapradesh ke mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan kaa musalamaanon dwaara ek kaarykram main satkar kiya jaataa he to use koi bhi tushtikaran nahin kahata, lekin jab ve azamgarh gayi the tab unki yatra kaa ulema concil, bhaajapa or aresas ne virodh kiya
 Regarding former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Uma Bharti, who recently returned to BJP, Digvijay said that this sadhvi leader had said that if she returned to BJP, she would not be loyal to her parents
 
 So it should be assumed now
 samaaj ke sadasyon ko lekar in dinon uthi bahes ke sambandh main unhone kaha ki aisa koi bhi tarika nahin he jiske tahat chune hue numaayindon ko samaaj ke gaiyr nirvaachit logon ke baraabar maanakar chalaa jaae
 However, in spite of this there is a great need to keep the views of non-elected people in mind
 unhone kaha ki isi kaaran se congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ne samaaj ke sadasyon ko rashtriya salaahkaar samiti main sadsy ke rup main manonith kiya he or aruna raay or harshamandar jaise iske sadsy lokapal vidheyak kaa masauda taiyaar karne main lage hue the
 Singh said that because the UPA government is sensitive to corruption, it also included people like Arvind Kejriwal and Shanti Bhushan in the joint committee that drafted this bill, while these people are against the Congress
 bhaajapa shasit madhyapradesh sarkaar ko nishaanaa banaate hue unhone kaha ki jab vah rajya ke mukhyamantri the tab pradesh main sakshartaa dar bahut bad gai thi, lekin pichley das saalon main vah bahut neeche gir gai he
 He said that the number of children suffering from malnutrition in the state has also gone up much earlier, although nowadays the state government is getting more than five times the amount from the center
 haal hi main bhaajapa main waapas lautin madhyapradesh kii purv mukhyamantri uma bharti ke bare main digvijay ne kaha ki is sadhvi netaa kaha tha ki agar ve bhaajapa main lautin to vah apane maa-baap ke prati vafaadaar nahin rahengi 
 
 to ab aisa maan liya janaa chahie
 Regarding the debate that has arisen these days about the members of the society, he said that there is no way under which the elected representatives should be treated as equal to the non-elected people of the society
 haalanki, iske baavjood gaiyr nirvaachit logon ke vichaaron ko bhi dhyaan main rakhane kii bahut aavashyaktaa he
 He said that it was for this reason that Congress President Sonia Gandhi nominated members of the society as members in the National Advisory Committee and its members like Aruna Rai and Harshamander were engaged in drafting the Lokpal Bill
 singh ne kaha ki kyonki samprag sarkaar bhrashtachar ke prati samvedansheel he isliye usne is vidheyak kaa masauda banane vaali sanyukt samiti main aravind kejariwal or shantibhushan jaise logon ko bhi shaamil kiya, jabaki ye log congress ke khilaaf hai
 Targeting the bjp-ruled Madhya Pradesh government, he said that when he was the Chief Minister of the state, the literacy rate in the state had increased a lot but in the last ten years it has fallen very low
 unhone kaha ki rajya main kuposhan se peedit bacchon kii sankhya bhi pehle se bahut zyada ho gai he, haalanki aajkal pradesh sarkaar ko pehle kii tulana main paanch guna se bhi zyada raashi kendra se mil rahi he

 One student said that blood was coming out from below, this answer also did not fill the heart of the MLA, so he stained the next question
 vidhayak lalan paswan ne chaatraon se kaha neeche kaa kya matlab hota he ? tum sab padhi likhi ladkiyaan ho or tum logon ko sahi se jawaab dena chahie
 If you do not answer correctly, you may be raped tomorrow

 balki likhi hi gai hogi
 Lakshman taught to see power from outside and in a normal and neutral manner
 in dinon ham satta ko satta ke jaisaa hokar dekhne lage hai
 Laxman's common man was a sign of keeping distance from power
 isse duuri baratani chahie
 Every work of this should be viewed with the eyes of a man
 isliye lakshmana kaa aam aadmi jhaank kar dekhtaa tha
 Peeking is an action that does not realize the place or person where an eye is coming from outside
 kisi se batch kar, bachaakar sabakuch dekh lenaa hi jhaankna he
 Laxman's common man looked at this with astonishment as if he had not seen what he should not have seen
 janata ne sab jaan liya he, bas sattanashinon ko hi khabar nahin he
 Laxman has taught us to look into this democracy
 aar ke lakshmana har din satta ke liye ek nai lakshmana rekha khinchate the
 He used to remind me where the Laxman Rekha of your promise ends
 kahin aap uske paar to nahin ja rahe hai
 a silent voice that spoke more than speaking leaders
 jo unki khamosh palon kii sazishon main bhi bol padati thi
 Everyone used to call the common man as Rama or deity, but only Laxman did anything for the life of Rama
 lakshmana kii vafadaari or zimmedaari sirf wo aam aadmi hi rahaa jo unke ram the
 Your cartoons are not just milestones
 balki satta kii zamir ke wo pathar hai jinase takraaye bina koi nahin batch saktaa

 Under the present system, tax is levied on the basis of increase in premium collection

 However, some arrears are never recovered
 isi tarah, prastaav ke saath agrim main praapt sabhi rashiyaan polisy main parivartit nahin hoti he
 The insurance industry has been demanding that service tax liability should be on the basis of receipt
 sutron ne kaha ki iskar vibhaag kuch beemaa pension utpaadon ke liye alag chhot seemaa tay karne par vichaar kar rahaa he jo maujuuda seemaa se upar hoga
 Currently, under the Income Tax Act, income tax deduction of up to Rs 1,00,000 is available on various investments including insurance premium payments along with other approved investments
 sarkaar pension utpaadon ko badhaava dene ke liye pension utpaadon main nivesh par alag se seemaa tay kar sakati he

 In addition, the tax authorities are exploring the possibility of whether service tax can be assessed on the basis of actual receipts
 vartmaan vyavastha ke tahat premium sangrah main hone vaali vruddhi ke aadhaar par kar lagaaya jaataa he
 Currently, service tax is levied on receipt of arrears or amount whichever is earlier
 haalanki, kuch bakaayaa raashi kii vasuuli kabhi nahin ho paati he
 Likewise, all amounts received in advance with the proposal do not change in the policy
 beemaa udyog maang karata rahaa he ki sevakar kii dendaree raashi prapti ke aadhaar par honi chahie
 Sources said the Income Tax Department is considering setting a separate exemption limit for some insurance pension products which would be above the existing limit
 vartmaan main, iskar kanoon ke tahat, anya manjuuri praapt niveshon ke saath beemaa premium bhugtan sahit vibhinn niveshon par 1,00,000 rupee tak kii iskar katautee uplabdh he

 biguef ke barkhaast jawan tej bahadur (tej Bahadur Yadav) kaa piem modi (PM Modi) ke khilaaf chunaav ladane kaa mansuba dhwast ho gaya
 His nomination has been rejected by the Election Commission
 buudhvaar ko naamankan khaarij hone par tej bahadur (tej Bahadur Yadav) jahaan ek taraf ye kah rahe the ki unke khilaaf saazish kii gai he vahiin wo duusari taraf ye bhi kah rahe hai ki namakan khaarij hone se wo chunaav bhale na lard paae lekin unki awaz koi nahin dabaa saktaa
 Now he will campaign SP to defeat Modi only by staying in Benares
 banaras ke jila kachhari main namakan bhale hi khatm ho gaya ho lekin buudhvaar ke din yahaan waisi hi gahamaa gahamibani rahi is gahamaa gahami kii badi vajah pehle nirdaleey or baad main sapa ke pratyaashee rahe tej bahadur (tej Bahadur Yadav) ke namakan kii vaidhata ko lekar rahi
 Tej Bahadur (tej Bahadur Yadav) along with his lawyer had reached the District Election Officer on time to answer
 unhone jawaab bhi lagaaya lekin shaam hote hote saafe ho gaya ki unka jawaab paryaapt nahin tha lihaaja parchaa khaarij ho gaya
 Tej Bahadur calls it a conspiracy against himself
 "just as soon as we filed the answer at 11 o'clock, the Election Commission also got clearance just after a while
 uske baad bhi hamen saadhe teen baje tak bitha kararkha gaya saat se aath baar paper ko phada gaya dilli se aadesh aa rahaa tha kii kisi bhi tarah is jawan kaa namakan radd kiya jaae
 Now let us say in the last that when both of you had made the nomination, then the Election Commission did not give the letter of permission
 biesaf ke barkhaast jawan ko tikat dekar samaajawaadee party ne ek tir se kai nishane lagaae the
 The target of that arrow was that if Tej Bahadur's nomination would have been valid and he would have given two hands to Modi in the election field, he would have surrounded him in his house on the issue of army and said that this fight is of real watchman vs fake watchman
 And now when the nomination is canceled
 to tej bahadur ko dusre tir kii tarah istemaal kar apane har manch se ek sipaahi ke munh se jahaan ye kahalwaayenge ki unka namakan saazishan khaarij karaayaa gaya he to duusari taraf sena ke naam par vot maang rahe piem modi ko ek jawan se jawaab dilaa kar unke is muhim ko hawa nikaalane kii koshish karenge
 That is, there were laddoos in both hands of Samajwadi Party regarding Tej Bahadur
 gauratlab he ki tej bahadur ne pehle nirdaleey parchaa bharaa tha usame unhone sena se apane nikaale jane ke kaaran ko 'haa' ke jawaab main bharaa tha or baad main jab sapa se namakan kiya to usame usee kalam main 'na' likh diya
 During the scrutiny of the form, an explanation was sought and citing the rules, the Election Commission was asked to bring a certificate which Tej Bahadur could not give
 jiladhikari surendra singh ne bataaya ki ek jo abhyarthi the tej bahadur unhone do namakan kiya tha
 His scrutiny was deferred, any person working in a central government or a state government had a dissolution, and the date of that dissimilar must be within five years
 Will bring a letter from
 janpratinidhitiv kanoon ke mutabik to chunaav ayog se certificate kii jarurat thi or is prakriya ko yahan par puraa nahin kiya gaya hamane mauqaa bhi diya 11 baje tak kaa wo nahin laaye to sunwaayee ke baad unka namakan nirast kiya gaya
 Tej Bahadur and his lawyers dismiss this argument of the District Election Commission as to why no such thing was sought to be filled by the Samajwadi Party after the Independence Form was filed
 isi vajah se inhe lag rahaa he kii ki rajanithik shadyantr hua he baharhaal unka parchaa khaarij hone ke baad samaajavaadee party ab plan bi kaam karengi unki duusari pratyaashee shalini yadav modi jo ko takkar dengi
 Whose nomination was also done on the same day
 sapa ke pravaktaa manoj raay dhoopchandi ise or spasht karte hai " pehle se hamako andaaza tha ki jo 56 inch kaa seenaa tha usko sirf munh se bolnaa he, bayanbir he bijepi ke log to ham logon ko laga tha ki agar kisi or sahaayak ko nahin rakhaa gaya to nishchit rup se khaarij kar denge ,to ham logon ne ek or sahaayak shalini yadav ko ab parche khaarij ho gayi ( ptch ) to sabsticute ummidavaar ke taur par shalini yadav kaa naam pehle se tha

 Here i am, thinking i have seen it all and heard it all
 
 
 But in the 11th hour of my pregnancy, there's yet another myth that i need to address! The 10th month
 Yes, there is a 10th month in pregnancy, and I'm currently living it
 So many people tried to correct me in one of my recent posts, thinking i may have accidentally written 10th instead of 9th
 No it was no accident
 The 10th month, as logic suggests, starts after the 9th month ends
 After 36 weeks of pregnancy, the baby is officially ready to come into this world
 40 weeks is considered a full term, and that's when the doctor gives you your EDD (estimated due date)
 The due date is always ESTIMATED because nobody can predict when the baby arrives
 It is extremely common and absolutely normal for women to reach 42 weeks before natural labour begins
 
 especially if it's the second pregnancy
 
 
 and once you cross 38 / 39 weeks, your 10th month begins
 So, while my clock ticks, i could go into labour right this minute, or another week later
 
 
 I'm not worried
 On the contrary, I'm rather relaxed
 Because i know, once the baby comes, I'll have my hands full! And i think now is the perfect time to also say that it's always the baby who decides when labor will begin
 So you can try all you want, get restless, get scans done, pray that the baby comes out fast (I know it's uncomfortable)
 
 
 But trust me, the baby is the most comfortable inside you! So don't hold your breath
 
 
 But remember, good things come to those who wait

 tasviir ek, 12 tughlaq len
 Rahul Gandhi's official residence
 somvaar ko yahaan subah se hi gahamagahami rahi
 Around eleven and a half a batch of Sikh community arrived here to perform
 ye rahul gandhi se maang kar rahe hai ki ve un congressiyon ke naam bataaen jo unke mutabiq 84 kii hinsa main shaamil the
 The case has taken hold ever since Rahul Gandhi said in an interview that some Congressmen were involved in it
 pehle congress mukhyalay ke saamne pradarshan hua
 Slogans of Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi Hi Hi
 yahi najaara yahaan bhi he
 The protesters were pushed away from the police
 kuch ek bairicade tod duusari tak pahunche
 But it is not possible to reach Rahul
 dilli police kii bairicading ke baad espiji kaa suraksha gheraa he
 SPG officials are all on alert with ear pants and ear plugs installed in the ears
 is pradarshan kaa netritv akali dal kar rahaa he
 Clearly, multiplication of political benefits is also included in this on the pretext of applying ointment to the wounds of Sikhs
 lekin 84 kii hinsa par rahul ke bayaan ke baad ho rahe pradarshnon par congress khul kar nahin bol rahi
 No big party leader is coming forward to defend its leader
 tasviir do, shaam ke chaar baje
 Hundreds of protesters have gathered again in front of Rahul's house
 lekin ye rahul gandhi hai hai kii bajaay rahul gandhi zindaabad ke naare laga rahe hai
 Most of these protesters are street vendors of Delhi
 inke paas shikayaton kaa pulinda he
 There is no place to put their shop on the street or on the street that they can call their own
 in logon ke saath yahaan bhojaram bhi aae hai
 Age is 62 years
 rohinee ke sector ek main pichley tees saal se rehadi par fal bechate he
 Their difficulties have increased day by day
 kabhi emsidi vaale, to kabhi police vaale avaidh vasuuli kar jate hai
 When you do not pay money, the riders are carried away
 bhaga dete hai
 The UPA government has managed to get the Street Vendor Bill 2012-13 passed in the Lok Sabha
 lekin ye rajya sabha main atka he
 Mill vendors from Rahul demanded that it be passed soon
 rahul ne bharosa diya
 Said this is your right bill, we will try my best
 yah sab kuch media ke camere ke saamne ho rahaa tha
 As a leader, Rahul continues to meet people of every section
 lekin nai baat ye he ki rahul ab atyadhik sakriy ho gaye hai
 Where there was no for the media, the media is being sent by sending a message
 party kii koshish saaf najar aati he ki rahul na sirf mehnat karen, balki vah mehnat karte hue, aam aadmi se baat karte hue dikhe bheen
 After giving confidence to the street vendors, Rahul turned to Jantar Mantar
 nido kii maut ke baad yahaan uttar purv ke chaatr pradarshan kar rahe hai
 Rahul assured that he would ensure strict action in the case of Nido's murder
 unhone kaha ki vah ek bharat main bharosa karte hai, jahaan bharat ke har naagarik ko ek jaise sammaan kaa haq he
 This shows that Rahul has learned from his criticisms of remaining silent on important issues
 vah har din ke mudde se, har aadmi ke mudde se jodne kii koshish main jute hai
 On this whole issue, India and Bhutan said that China has violated the status quo at the indo-bhutan-china International Tiraha, while China claims that it is its territory
 bharat, bhutan kaa sabase bada vyapaarik saajhedaar desh he
 Bilateral trade between the two countries stood at Rs 8,723 crore in 2016, while total imports stood at Rs 5,528
 5 karod rupee or kul niryaat 3,205
 2 crores remained
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne ravivaar ko radio ke jariye kisaanon se 'man kii baat' kii
 Government's commitment towards crop waste and land acquisition bill reiterated

 The popular vs
 classic debate has never been a big question in the Hindi mainstream
 lekin pichhlaa saal isi bahes ke naam rahaa
 It started with the interview of poet Kumar Vishwas, who appeared in the magazine Pakhi, in the editing of Prem Bhardwaj
 kahanikar priyanvad samet kai lekhakon ko yah baat nagavar gujri
 The voices of protest were quite vocal
 bharadwaj bataate hai ki is intervyuu ko chhapane ke liye unhen kaaphi virodh or aalochana kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 But they have their own arguments in its favor
 ve kehete hai, ''aap is sach ko kaise nakaar sakate hai ki kumaar vishwaas lokapriy hai
 The mainstream treats popularity as untouchable and avoids it
 yah nahin hona chahie
 Kumar Vishwas himself says on this puritanism of Hindi, "this puritanism of Hindi is the reason for its being cut off from the masses
" hindi kii gyanpith or academy lobby se main poochna chahta hum ki aapkaa sahitya itnaa hi umdaa he to yah bikta kyon nahin

 So is it still right to say that there are no readers in Hindi? On the one hand there is the old cry of the non-sale of Hindi books, on the other hand there are books which people are reading by searching and asking
 hindi ilaake ke pathakon ke bich pichley dinon sabase zyada charchit kitabon main se ek thi anil kumaar yadav kaa yatra vrittant ye bhi koi des he maharaj
 In 2014, the book sold 1,600 copies and 5,500 copies so far

 The classic versus popular debate continues among these figures

 Says Meenakshi, "ravi Bulle's novel from Harper last year sold 1,500 copies of Dalal's wife

 The problem of distribution that Meenakshi is talking about is not the problem of all Hindi publishers

 "overall the statistics are saying that books are being sold in Hindi
 lekin ek sawaal phir bhi munh baae khadaa he
 Psychoanalyst Sudhir Kakkar asks, "what is selling, is it really underlining its time?" Is anyone interested in reading life's squid, conflicts, challenges and darkness or is the geography of the dreams and concerns of the new generation confined to the shiny world of sex, ambition and metros? " The answer is probably somewhere in between

 On this, Jaitley said that since this provision is being made through the constitutional amendment, there will be no doubt about it
 unhone samvidhan kii mul praswaavna kaa ullekh karte hue kaha ki usamen kaha gaya he ki desh ke prayek naagarik ko uske vikaas ke liye samaan avasar milenge

 Seven-year-old Masoombacchi Ayesha Siddiqui Kashvash in Asawarpur village in Sonipat, Haryana, sensation spread in front of her house at the tidal field
 maasoom khilne ke liye ghar se nikali thi or achaanak laapata ho gai thi
 Three hours later, his body was recovered from the farm
 is ghatana kii soochna par pahunchipulicene shav ko kabje main lekar postmortem ke liye aspataal bhej diya
 At present, the cause of death has not been clear, but the family of Bachchi is anticipating his murder
 haalanki police kaa kahana he ki postmortem report main hi maut ke kaarnon kaa pataa chal paaegaa
 Originally from Guwahati, Assam, a family was currently living in a field room outside the village of Asawarpur
 bacchee ke parijan kabadi kaa kaam karte hai
 Ayesha left to play Siddiqui on Thursday afternoon
 jab vah kaaphi der baad tak waapas nahin lauti, to parijanon ne uski talash shuru kii
 After about three hours, the baby Kashava was found in the jowar field in suspicious locations
 uski gardan ke paas kisi ke daant ke nishaan bane the
 In front of his house is a field of jowar and millet
 police ne shav ko kabje main lekar postmortem ke liye bhej diya he
 According to the police, the cause of death will be clear only after the post mortem report comes
 is baat kii bhi jaanch kii jaaegi ki bacchee ke saath koi galat kaam to nahin hua
 The body of the girl, who came out to play from home, was found in Jowar's field
 philhal maamle main tafteesh kii ja rahi he
 The trailer of Vishal Pandya's next film 'reasons You' Ho, which created sexy murder mystery like 'hate Story-2' and 'hate Story-3', has been released
 vishaal jis tarah kii filmameking ke liye mashhoor hai, usee tarah kii filmameking ko 'vajah tum ho' main dekha ja saktaa he
 In the film, Sana Khan is seen in a bold avatar, and is enjoying her beautiful body and kissing
 unke alaava, hot and sexishrlin choprabhi hai jo apane bold andaaj, 'kamasutra' film or 'plaboy mension' main shoot kii vajah se surkhiyon main rahi hai
 Low budget Bollywood Murder Mystery and it does not have the touch of sex, it cannot happen
 aaie ham bataate hai ki aakhir kyon jaruri hota he is tarah kii filmon main sex kaa chhaunkikam daam main ooncha daantksar is tarah kii murder mistry lo bajet filmein hoti hai
 Those whose starcast is not very big, and the producer's focus is on establishing such a USP of the film, which can get tremendous publicity at a low price
 phir mayanagari is kahawat se kaaphi prerit rahati he ki badnaam hue to kya naam na hoga
 Just coming here is a touch of boldness, and some beautiful moments of love are added to the murder mystery
 duubati heroinon ko badan kaa saharaisi filmon kii starcast choti hoti he
 Like 'hate Story-3' had Zarine Khan and Daisy Shah in the lead
 donon kaa hi kariyar danvadol tha
 In such a situation, he needed a short that would bring him into the headlines overnight
 unhone boldnes kaa daaman thama or film main unke garmagarm seen ne unhen khyaati dilaai
 Now take Sana Khan, she has made headlines by coming to Bigg Boss and has also done a controversial advertisement
 kai bollywood filmein bhi kin lekin kismat nahin chali
 Now he has decided to recognize his x factor and use it to its fullest
 janata kaa masalaek jamaana tha jab cinemagharon main morning sho chalaa karte the
 a special section used to visit those shows
 lekin technology kii maar kahen yaa multiplex culture kii dhamak
 The era of these films were overpowered and this audience was completely ignored
 single screen vaale ye shrota is tarah kii filmon ko hathohath lete hai
 Therefore, in low budget films, the director tries to add spice, so that the single-screened viewer gets every item for which he has stepped out of the house
 dadli combination he lav, sex or dhokhajems hedli cheij se lekar surendra mohan pathak or veda prakaash sharma tak ke popular litarechar kii aatma rahaa hailav, sex or dhokhaa
 It is a spice that has been sold since time immemorial
 phir vah chaahe murder ho yaa jism yaa phir het story siries
 Love, sex and deception have all been prominent in all this, and the same factor has also drawn the film
 jo dikhataa he vah bikta heaksar dekha gaya he ki agar kahani thodi majboot ho or sex kaa majboot chhaunk ho to film box offis par khud ko bachaa hi le jaati he
 In the film 'jism', Bipasha created a panic
 phir sani leone ne jism-2 se darshakon ko lubhaaya
 Similarly, in 'murder', Malika Sherawat forced the audience to sigh
 phir is kadi main paoli dam, surveen chawla, jarine khan or ab sanaa khan kaa naam jud gaya he
 These films have also had a good record at the box office
 kendriya petroleum mantri murali devda ne mangalvaar ko kaha ki vidhansabha chunaavon ke baad sarkaar tel kii keemton main katautee kar sakati he
 Earlier, Deora had refrained from making any statement regarding the reduction in oil prices
 kuch din pehle devda ne loksabhaa main prashnkaal ke dauraan ek anupoorak prashn kaa jawaab dete hue kaha tha ki is masale par nigaah rakhi ja rahi he or jald hi is sambandh main ghoshnaa kar di jaaegi
 Opposition parties were not satisfied with Deora's statement
 vipakshi dalon kaa kahana tha ki antarrashtriya bazaaron main kachche tel kii keemton main pachaas fisadi se bhi adhik kii giravat aane ke baavjood centre sarkaar desh main petroleum kii keemten kam karne main hichkicha rahi he
 It is noteworthy that crude oil prices in the global markets, which were 147 in July
 27 dollar prati bairal kii ricard oonchai tak pahunch gai thi ve ab 55 dollar prati bairal ke neeche aa gai he
 The Indian cricket team would like to leave the bad phase behind and play the win in 'auspicious time' while playing with England on Tuesday
 bhartiya team paanch maichon kii ekadivasiy shrinkhalaa main 0-1 se peeche chal rahi he
 Only time will tell whether she will be able to make a fresh start with a win in Kochi, but the last one month has been very bad for India
 use england ke haathon test shrinkhalaa main haar mili or phir pakistan ke haathon ekadivasiy shrinkhalaa ganvaani padi
 In Rajkot, India had scored 316 runs chasing a mammoth target of 326 runs
 vah match kai lihaaj se ahm tha
 Staying so close to victory while chasing a big goal indicates a bad time
 ab jabaki kharmaas biit chukaa he, bharat ke saamne nai chunautiyaan hai
 He has to manage himself before the home Test series with Australia and for that he will have to win over the English team
 captain mahendra singh dhoni ko un galatiyon se bachanaa hoga, jo unhone rajkot main kii thi
 The absence of the in-form Cheteshwar Pujara in the playing XI had caused criticism for Dhoni
 dhoni rabindra jadeja ke sthaan par pujaara ko team main shaamil kar sakate the lekin beete match main pakistan ke khilaaf harfanmaulaa pradarshan karne vaale jadeja ko captain kaa bharosa mila or is tarah bharat ko ek achche form main chal rahe ballebaaj ke bina hi maidan main utarana padaa
 This time is bad for Dhoni
 ek samay tha, jab vah jis cheez ko choote the, sona ho jaataa tha lekin aaj halaat badal chuke hai
 There was a time when Dhoni's wrong decisions were also proved correct, but today many of his right decisions are also proved wrong
 aise main dhoni ko jaanboojhkar koi jid yaa galati se bachate hue apane saathiyon ko acha khilne ke liye prerit karnaa chahie
 This is more important for the team because without Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag, the team is seen to be weak anyway
 or to or salaami ballebaaj beete saal se lekar ab tak ek maukey par bhi acchhee shuruyaat nahin de sake hai
 The team lacks balance of performance
 yahi kaaran he jab gendbaaj acha karte hai to ballebaaj flop ho jate hai or jab ballebaaj chamakate hai to gendbaaj kaam kharaab kar dete hai
 In Rajkot, three England batsmen had scored more than 100 runs and four batsmen of India were able to make more than this average but despite this the team lost
 kaaran saaf he, bhartiya ballebaajon ko kuch or der tak wicket par tike rahanaa hoga
 It is the same for bowlers
 ishanth sharma ne pakistan ke khilaaf tisare mukaable main dilli main shandaar gendbaaji kii thi lekin rajkot main unke 10 over ke cote main 86 ran bane
 Being a strike bowler, Ishant has to be consistent in his performance
 duusari ore, english team ke saamne bharat se kaaphi kam chintaaen hai
 His batsmen are in good rhythm and the bowlers are doing their job well
 ekadivasiy shrinkhalaa se pehle do abhyaas match haarane ke baavjood english team ne uskaa asar apane pradarshan par nahin aane diya
 Trying Ian Bell as an opener by captain Alastair Cook has led to new energy communication for the team
 do abhyaas maichon se lekar ab tak bel ek shatak or ek ardhashatak laga chuke hai
 He has good and in-form batsmen in the form of Eoin Morgan, Craig Keyswetter and Kevin Pietersen, who have the ability to score at a very fast pace
 in sabane rajkot main ise sabit bhi kiya he
 It is difficult to say what the Kochi pitch will do but it is so sure that the English team is looking to equalize the 5-0, 5-0 defeat in the last two series in India and it is very difficult to stop them in these conditions of India
 Will be difficult

 34 years ago, India's most prosperous state, Punjab, was burning in the fire of communal violence for three years
 tejatarraar granthi jaranel singh bhindrawaale ke netritv main sikhon ke ek vidrohi gut ne jang ched rakhi thi
 By 1984, Bhindranwale's armed companions had killed more than 100 ordinary citizens and security personnel by 1984
 1981 se bhindrawaale amritsar main sikhon ke sabase pavitra gurudware swarna mandir ke paas apane hathiyaarband saathiyon ke ghere main chipa baitha tha
 The then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was troubled by this blood struggle going on in a happy state like Punjab
 indira aakhir us nishkarsh par pahunchin, jahaan un jaisaa koi diler hi pahunch saktaa tha
 The result was the Indian Army's operation 'operation Blue Star' in the Golden Temple complex, the most sacred site of Sikhs, on this day in 1984
 sena kaa mishan amritsar ke swarna mandir ko jaranel singh bhindrawaale or unke samarthakon ke changul se chhudaana tha
 Operation Sun Down was planned before Blue Star
 This army operation was mainly conducted from 3 to 8 June 1984 on the orders of Indira Gandhi
 haalanki, is abhiyaan kii ranneeti par kaaphi pehle se kaam shuru ho chukaa tha
 Operation Sundown was planned before Operation Blue Star but this operation was put on hold
 kai maheene pehle shuru ho gai thi oparation sandown kii taiyaaridarasal 1983 se hi bhindrawaale ko swarna mandir se khadedane kii taiyaariyaan sena ne shuru kar di thim
 The campaign was named Operation Sundown
 oparation ko yah naam isliye diya gaya ki sari karrwai aadhi raat ke baad honi thi
 In early 1983, six military officers from a secret group called the Special Group, SG, were transported to the secret base of the Israeli Commando Force Sairat Matkal
 tedhvive ke paas sthit is adde par in sainik adhikariyon ko sadakon, imaaraton or gadipoon ke badi saavdhaanee se banaae gaye modelon ke bich aatank se ladane kii 22 din tak training di gai
 This was the strategy of Operation Sundown
 Director General Security told PM Indira Gandhi about a secret mission to capture the Golden Temple, which was less than a military attack
 unka kahana tha ki oparation sandown asal main jhapatta markar dabochne kii karrwai he
 Commandos aboard the helicopter will land at Guru Nanak Niwas Guest House near the Golden Temple and pick up Bhindranwale
 oparation ko yah naam isliye diya gaya ki sari karrwai aadhi raat ke baad honi thi, jab bhindrawaale or uske saathiyon ko isaki ummid sabase kam hogi
 Before the operation, the commandos practiced the members of the special group in February 1984, disguised as devotees and journalists, entered the Golden Temple and saw the entire map around
 april 1984 main research and analysis wing (ro) main ek pramukh adhikari, jo ab diarector general security (dijies) ho chuke the, unke niyantran main airforce kii ek choti-si tukdi special frontier force or do gupt ardhsainik unit, special services beuro thim
 For two months, SG personnel drawn from the army were being trained for important missions at a secret base near Delhi
 special group ke sadsy shraddhaluon or patrakaron ke vesh main swarna mandir main ghuskar aasapaas kaa sara nakshaa dekh aae the
 After that more than two hundred commandos practiced this operation for several weeks on a fake model of a two-storey rest house at their base in Sarsawa in Uttar Pradesh
 commando emi-4 helicopter se rassi ke sahare guestaouse main utarate the or bhindranvaale kii talash karte the
 After capturing him, the ground squad used to enter there and blow it up
 ashanka thi ki bhindranvaale ke angrakshakon or bachaane aane vaale nagarikon ke saath golibari hogi
 Indira therefore said to Operation Sundown, 'no' Mrs
 Gandhi kept listening silently and then asked only one question, 'how much loss will there be?' DGS replied that twenty percent of the commandos and both helicopters
 uske is jawaab se shrimati gandhi khij gayi
 She wanted to know how many ordinary citizens would be killed
 ro ke adhikari ke paas is sawaal kaa koi jawaab nahin tha
 Actually, no one had the right answer and the talk was over
 shrimati gandhi ne inkaar kar diya or pehle helicopter ke udaan bharne se pehle hi oparation sandown kaa patakshep ho gaya

 Before the Lok Sabha elections, the enthusiasts in Madhya Pradesh are strong about the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS)
 rajya kii congress sarkaar ne bhopal sthit RSS ke mukhyalay se suraksha hataane kaa faisla kiya he, jis par unki hi party ke diggaj digvijay singh ne sawaal khadey kar die hai
 Digvijay has tweeted and appealed to restore the security of the Sangh office
 darasal, somvaar der raat kamalnath sarkaar kii ore se bhopal main maujuud aresas offis se suraksha hataane kii baat kahi he
 Late night, security began to withdraw from there
 bhopal main maujuud sangh kaa daftar puure madhyapradesh or chhattisgarh kaa centre he
 In such a situation, the Lok Sabha candidate of Congress Digvijay Singh from Bhopal seat had objected to this
 digvijay ne twit kiya, ‘’bhopal rashtriya swayamsevak sangh karyaalay se suraksha hataanaa bilkul uchit nahin he, main mukhyamantri kamalnath ji se anurodh karata hum ki tatkaal pun: paryaapt suraksha dene ke aadesh den’’
 Removal of security from Bhopal National self-service Union Office is not at all appropriate
 i request Chief Minister Kamal Nath ji to give orders to provide adequate security immediately
 — digvijaya singh (@digvijaya_28)april 2, 2019bataa den ki mukhyamantri kamalnath or digvijay singh donon hi purv main sangh ke aalochak rahe hai, aise main ab loksabhaa chunaav se pehle digvijay kaa ye kadam chaunkaane vaala he
 The Bharatiya Janata Party has also been fiercely reacting to the withdrawal of security from the Samadhi by Leader of Opposition in the Madhya Pradesh Assembly, Gopal Bhargava, tweeting that 'removal of security from the office of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh' in Bhopal is a very condemnable move by @officeofknath
 @INCMP dwaara shaayad phir kisi hamale kii yojana banaai gai he, agar kisi swayamsevak ko kharonch bhi ai to congress sarkaar kii eent se eent baja di jaaegi'
 At the same time, BJP spokesperson Lokendra Parashar has also written in a warning tone that the retaliatory move of @officeofknath government, Congress may have planned another attack by removing security from Bhopal office of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh
 inhen kya lagata he sangh dar jayega! sangh naa rukta he naa jhukta he, kisi swayamsevak ko kharonch bhi ai to samaj len ki kya hoga'
 Why is the Bhopal Union Headquarters special? Let us tell you that the Sangh office in Bhopal is the headquarters of Samidha Central Zone where the RSS holds important meetings of the Central Provinces and in which all the important people associated with the Sangh are involved as well as many big leaders of BJP It keeps on coming and going here
 bataur mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan bhi kai baar yahaan aa chuke hai lekin bijepi kii sarkaar jane ke saal 2009-2010 se samidha ke baahar tainaat eseef ke javaanon ko somvaar der raat hataa diya gaya
 Although there is no statement from the government or police on why the soldiers were removed, nor any response from the Sangh, but the BJP has opened a front against the Kamal Nath government
 kamalnath isse pehle hi sarkaar banane se pehle or sarkaar banane ke baad sangh ko lekar tikhi tippanee karte rahe hai, jisapar unka bhaajapa netritv se bhi takaraav rahaa he
 In the manifesto of Madhya Pradesh Assembly Elections, it was promised that it would ban the Sangh branch in government offices, now work has started on it before the Lok Sabha elections
 vahiin isse pehle bhi kamalnath sarkaar ne sarkari afasaron ko aadesh diya tha ki vah RSS kii shakha main naa jaaen or agar koi jaataa he to usapar karrwai kii ja sakati he
 It is worth noting that the Sangh has a lot of cadre and influence in Madhya Pradesh, in such a situation it will also be seen how these decisions of the state government have an impact in the Lok Sabha elections

 singh ne rashtriya swayan sevak sangh ke sarasang chaalak mohan bhagwat kii us tippanee kii aalochana kii he, jisamen unhone kaha tha ki bhartiya shaharon main paashchaatikaran, bad rahe aparaadhon kaa kaaran he
 Singh said that there is no basis to differentiate between rural and urban India in the case of crimes against women
 grih sachiv, singh ne yahaan ek kaarykram ke itar maukey par kaha ki india or bharat ke bich fark bataane kaa koi aadhaar nahin he
 It may be known that Bhagwat had said in Assam that crimes like rape rarely occur in India, but such crimes continue to happen in India
 bhagwat ne assam ke silchar main aresas kaaryakartaaon kii ek sabha main kaha tha ki aap desh ke gaanvon or jangalon main jaaie, vahaan samuhik dushkarm yaa yon aparaadh kii is tarah kii ghatnaayen nahin milengi
 These incidents are happening indiscriminately in some urban areas
 nae kanoonon ke alaava bhartiya lokachar or mahilaon ke prati ravaiye kii, pracheen bhartiya mulyon ke sandarbh main samiksha kii jaani chahie
 This controversial remark by Bhagwat comes at a time when a 23-year-old girl was gang-raped by a six-year-old girl in a moving bus in the national capital of Delhi on December 16, brutally beating her and her male friend
 
 baad main singapore ke ek aspataal main yuvati kii mrityu ho gai
 Since then, large-scale protests have been taking place in Delhi and across the country to protest against this incident
 pantalis sadasyeey newclear saplir group (enesji) ne bharat ke saath asainik parmaanu vyapaar kii ijaajat dene ke liye apane niyamon main sudhaar kiya
 Thus after India's nuclear test in 1974, 34 years of nuclear discrimination came to an end with it
 vienna main bharat kii safalataa ke baad bharat-america parmaanu samjhaute main mukhya bhoomika nibhaane vaale videsh mantri pranav mukherjee ne prabandh sampadakraj chengappaore senior editorsorabh shuklase bharat ke parmaanu bhavishya par baat kii
 Excerpts: How important is the lifting of the ban on the nuclear supplier group? This is the end of our era of nuclear untouchability
 1974 ke parmaanu pareekshan ke baad hamane kade pratibandhon kaa saamana kiya
 Our nuclear scientists were not even allowed to attend international seminars
 enesji ke pratibandh hatane se hamen duusare deshon ke saath asainik parmaanu vyapaar karne kaa passport mil gaya he
 This is an acknowledgment of India's special importance and its clean record in the matter of nuclear non-proliferation
 antarrashtriya samudaay ko puraa bharosa he ki yah asainik parmaanu sahyog bharat ke liye acha he or duniya ke liye bhi
 Is the removal of the NSG ban as clean and unconditional as it is introduced? Clean and unconditional is almost the same thing
 hamane sweekaar na kii ja sakane vaali kisi shart ko nahin mana he, na hi hamaari kisi lakshmana rekha kaa ulanghan kiya gaya he
 We got a clean discount
 misaal ke taur par ham nahin chaahate the ki ham par koi aisi shart lagu ho ki hamen koi pareekshan karne kii ijaajat nahin di jaaegi
 We have been repeatedly saying that we will not conduct nuclear tests on our own, we do not want to make it binding on the terms of the treaty
 enesji ne hamaari sthiti ko maan liya he
 They did not ban us from nuclear testing, but that does not mean that they have allowed us to do so
 agar hamen kuch karne kaa adhikaar he to unhen pratikriya karne kaa
 And if we do something, then we should also be ready to bear its consequences
 kya china ke rukh se aapako hataasha hui he?yadi china sarvasammati kaa hissaa na hota to enesji main sarvasammati hoti hi nahin
 This is simple
 aarambhik daur main uski harakatein saamaanya nirnay prakriya kaa hissaa thim
 But the National Security Advisor said they were desperate
 is tarah ke bayaan die gaye honge
 What i am saying is the policy of the government
 china ke videsh mantri ne jo kaha ki kaam shabdon se adhik bolte hai, vah mujhe pasand aayaa
 And their actions proved that they were part of the consensus
 lekin apane desh main to qaraar par ab tak sarvasammati nahin ban pai he
 Both the BJP and the Left are accusing you of selling the country
 main kah nahin saktaa ki maine desh ko kitni baar bechaa he
 In the '80s, as finance minister, i borrowed money from IMF, then the opposition said that i had sold the economic sovereignty of my country
 '90 ke dashak main jab maine dablutio par hastakshar kiye tab bhi yahi aarope laga
 Recently, as Defense Minister, i faced similar allegations when i signed a draft agreement with the US
 aakhir ek cheez ko kitni baar bechaa ja saktaa he?bhaajapa kaa to kahana he ki hamane parmaanu pareekshan karne kaa apana adhikaar ganvaa diya he
 And our strategic options are also being limited
 unhen raashtra ko is baat kaa spashtikaran dena he ki unhone 1998 ke baad aisa kyon kaha ki bharat ko kisi or pareekshan kii jarurat nahin he
 Why? The reason for declaring such unilateral prohibition? My point is that if we had the right to test in 1998, it still is
 us samay apane adhikaar kaa prayog karne ke hamen kuch parinaam jhelane pade the
 That can happen anyway
 sthiti main koi badlaav nahin aayaa he
 There is no compromise, it is baseless criticism
 vampanthi dal sansad kaa vishesh satr bulaanaa chaahate hai
 He is accusing the government of lying after leaking letters from US Congressman Howard Burman on the nuclear deal
 jhooth kya he? yadi mujhe kuch pataa he or maine sach nahin bolaa to vah to jhooth he lekin is maamle main america kii kaaryakarini or vidhayika ke bich kya hua uski jaankaree mujhe kaise ho sakati he? hamaara sarokaar to usee se he, jisamen ham shaamil hai, jiseki 123 samjhauta or baaki baaten
 So, what is the basis of this charge? What are the fuel supply assurance issues being raised for the new nuclear reactors being built? The 123 agreement has to be assessed on the basis of what the provisions are
 jaisaaki maine kaha, pratibandh hataanaa sirf passport bhar he
 The visa will be a bilateral agreement, which we will do with the NSG countries with whom to do nuclear trade
 aapane kaha ki bharat duusare enesji deshon ke saath parmaanu vyapaar shuru karne se pehle america qaraar ke puraa hone kaa intjaar karegaa
 What i said was different from this
 maine kaha tha ki 123 agreement tab tak puraa nahin hota jab tak america congress ise manjuuri nahin detii
 So we have to wait till the completion of this process
 tabhi ham america ke saath parmaanu vyapaar kar sakate hai
 In principle, no one can stop them from entering into agreements with other countries
 to ham france or rus jaise duusare deshon ke saath samjhauta kar sakate hai?beshak ham kaam shuru karne ke liye duusare deshon se parmaanu vyapaar kar sakate hai
 And we would like to do so soon
 nijee companiyon ko parmaanu vyapaar kii ijaajat dene ke liye kya aap gharelu parmaanu urja adhinium main sanshodhan karenge?abhi kuch kahana jaldbaaji hogi
 The current belief is that the government will do business through the Atomic Energy Commission
 abhi main kuch nahin kah saktaa ki aam chunaav ke baad kya hoga or nai sarkaar kab banegi?hamaare parmaanu hathiyaar kaarykram kaa kya hoga?parmaanu siddhant kii avadharana vaajapeyi sarkaar ne viksit kii thi or ham usee par chal rahe hai
 We are not increasing or reducing our program
 hamaare paas nunatam vishwasaneey parmaanu suraksha jarur honi chahie taaki ham par koi parmaanu hathiyaaron se hamalaa na kare kyonki unhen yah pataa hona chahie ki hamaara javaabi hamalaa unhen maanya nahin hoga
 We are not willing to accumulate nuclear weapons or participate in the nuclear arms race
 parmaanu qaraar par sarvasammati na bana paane or vamapanthiyon ko upie se baahar jane se na roak paane par aap niraash hue the?yah mushkil tha
 Their differences were theoretical
 unhone hamase kaha tha ki ham france or rus ke saath to qaraar kar sakate hai lekin america ke saath nahin
 i cannot change their theoretical concept
 or enesji kii manjuuri ke bina rus or france ke saath koi qaraar sambhav nahin tha
 If Asif Zardari has become the President of Pakistan, will it help him to have a better relationship now? i would prefer to keep an eye on it because doing something is more effective than saying
 jab nai sarkaar bani to main pakistan gaya tha
 When i spoke with him, there was no lack of verbal assurances
 uske baad yudhviram kaa ulanghan hua, ghuspaith badi, kabul main bam dhamaake hue or phir lachchhedaar baaten huin
 We have sent some concrete proposals on cross-border trade starting from 1 October
 hamen sakaaratmak pratikriya milti he to hamen khushi hogi
 Concrete work is more effective than words

 They say that the mother keeps the baby in the womb for nine months, passes through a labor pen and then gives birth to a child, but to adopt this child, i have endured a labor pen for a year and a half! This is the story of software engineer Aditya Tiwari and his Son of Binny
 jis umr main zyaadaatar ladke apni chizon ko hi nahin sambhaal pate us umr main aditya ek bachche ke diaper badalte hai, use kahani sunaakar sulaate hai, uske saath khelte hai or har wo kaam karte hai jo ek maa apane bachche ke liye karti he
 Aditya is a single parent
 
 
 kunvaare pita
 With this, he is India's youngest single parent
 unhone ek aise bachche ko apnaane kii himmat dikhaai jise khud uski maa ne mara hua maan liya tha
 The mother, who nurtured Binny for nine months, endured a labor pen to give birth to her, when she came to know that Binny was a special child, and left her in an orphanage
 binni ko Down Syndrome kii shikaayat he or uske dil main chhed bhi he
 Parents were afraid that if they take the child home, their social status will be dusted
 16 march 2014 ko janma ye kuch hi dinon kaa baccha anaath ashram main phenk diya gaya
 
 
 To Die
 
 
 jindagi se akele ladane ke liye
 
 
 That day was Aditya's father's birthday
 wo apane papa ke saath Missionaries of Charity’s orphanage, Jyoti Niwas gaye hue the
 Where there were many children
 sabhi kuch na kuch kar rahe lekin ek baccha ek kone main chupchaap baitha hua tha
 There was no expression on the face, nor any movement in the hands and feet
 aditya us bachche ke paas gaye,use god main uthaaya
 This was Binny and Aditya's first meeting
 binni ko god main uthaane ke saath hi aditya ne use betaa maan liya
 Aditya was told that Binny is a special child and that is why no one wants to take him
 logon ko khubasurat, hansmukh or active bachche chahie hote hai
 When Aditya talked about adopting this child, he was sidelined by the legal rules and regulations
 unase kaha gaya ki baccha god lene ke liye 30 kii umr ke saath-saath shaadishuda hona bhi jaruri he
 Aditya's one and a half year labor pen started from here
 
 
 aditya bataate hai ki jab unhone bachche ko god lene kii baat sabko bataai to logon ne unhen tarah-tarah kii baaten sunaayi
 People even called him impotent
 ye bhi kah diya ki iskaa hi baccha hoga, naatak kar rahaa he lekin aditya ke parents ne unka puraa saath diya
 Initially, he too felt that Aditya was doing wrong
 baccha sanbhaalanaa itnaa aasaan to nahin
 
 
 But later they agreed
 dedh saal tak aditya system or logon se ladate rahe
 But perhaps the fate of that child was not called an orphan
 kismat or aditya kii koshish rang le ai
 Binny became a household lamp on 1 January 2016
 kisi he is single parent kii jindagiaditya bataate hai ki meraa betaa mujhase abhi baat nahin karata lekin wo mujhe samajhataa he
 i am his world for him
 jab main offis jaataa hum to wo sota rahata he lekin main lunch time main usase milane aata hum
 We go for a walk in the evening, play together, eat
 uski ek muskaan meri dinabhar kii thakaan ko dur kar detii he
 On the question of marriage, Aditya says that he will marry only the girl who can adopt his son
 uski maa ban sakegi
 Aditya is currently trying to give Binny every better treatment
 binni pehle se bahut behatar he
 Aditya wants to do a lot for Special Children and calls this effort his first attempt
 wo bahut jaldi hi ek ashram bhi kholane vaale hai
 Aditya believes that a child is very easy to handle
 agar ise kaam samajhenge to ye mushkil hi lagegaa lekin use jimmedaari maniye, use enjvoy kiijie
 Nothing will be difficult and if the child was so hard to raise, the population of India would not have been so much
 aditya maanate hai ki is special child ne unhen bhi special bana diya he

 gujarat main narendra modi kii chunavi jeet kii tulana karne ke liye cricket match se behatar nazir bhala or kya ho sakati he
 After all, as much as the media of this country is for cricket, equally crazy for Modi
 gujarat main narendra modi kii jeet baaji palatney vaali ho sakati he
 Modi's confidence in a bowler after taking three wickets for three consecutive balls is similar to that seen in Modi after winning three consecutive elections
 aisa gendbaaj jis tarah apni team ke liye nazir or dusron ke liye chetavanee ban jaataa he, thik vahi haal modi kaa bhi he
 Now, in such a situation, it can be asked that which Nazir is presenting the Nazir? It is quite clear that Modi has taken a clear lead only because of his dedication to a party run by dynasty politics and that too when political dynasty is not yet over
 ve jitani der jage hote hai, kaam main lage rahete hai or bataaya jaataa he ki parivaar ke saath unka rishta saal main sirf ek baar apni maa ko phone karne tak simit he

 It is indeed pleasant to see that in our democratic times such an achievement can also be achieved through ballots
 modi kii jeet kuch or bhi kahati he: vah yah ki agar chunaav niyamit taur par swatantra or nishpaksh tareeke se karaae jaaen to chunavi pranali puraskaar or dand ke ek vidhaan ke taur par kaam karti he
 Modi's victory restores our faith in the belief that if you work for everyone, then most people will support you and will do it with heavy votes
 modi ne vikaas ke bare main apni apil ko kaaphi satarkta se logon ke bich rakhaa or logon ne bhi shaayad yah mahasoos kiya ki jab jowar aata he to sari naaven apane aap upar kii ore uth jaati hai
 People also felt that development is largely caste and secular

 And right here, Modi's victory comes in another way as Nazir, that personal honesty and credibility bear the political fruit
 unke kai prachaar sambodhano main hamane suna he, ‘‘main paise nahin letaa or dusron ko bhi aisa nahin karne detaa hum
 "power does not always make the corrupt always, it can also be used to uproot the corrupt
" kuch log modi kii jeet ko taanaashaahee kii lokapriyata or sampradayikta kii uplabdhi ke taur par dekh rahe hai
 For example, the fact that he did not field a single Muslim candidate in the election
 sampradayik tanaav ke nahin hone ko ve is tarah dekhte hai ki ek samudaay vishesh kaa itnaa daman kiya gaya he ki usne samarpan hi kar daalaa he

 They may not understand how Modi's rise is a strong example of a welcome change in the core spirit of Hinduism
 chauthi sadi se hi hindu dharm apane bheetar palane vaale tanaavon se grast rahaa he, jab mahilaon or shudron ko veda padhgaye se roka gaya
 At the center of this tension was the question — rather still — that who would decide what Hinduism should mean? Men of the three higher varnas or all Hindu male and female? The rise of representatives of "backward castes" such as Ramdev in the field of religion and Modi on the national scale in the field of politics shows that this question is now being resolved in favor of all Hindu men and women who have equal share in its structure
