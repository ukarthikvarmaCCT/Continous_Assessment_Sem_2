 " In the 25th meeting of the GST Council, filing of GST returns was discussed
 is dauraan infosis ke chairman nandan nilekani ne jiesti ritern file karne ke liye single form laane ko lekar prajentation bhi diya
 Currently, even though Singal Form is not coming for this, but preparation has been done for it
 parishad kii agali baithak main ise laane par faisla ho saktaa he
 An important issue with the GST Council meeting that took place on Thursday was to make it easier to file GST returns
 maujuuda samay main kaarobaariyon kojisti riternke taur par kai tarah ke form bharne padate hai
 The most important of these are GSTR 3, GSTR 1, and GSTR 2
 dher saare form hone kii vajah se chote kaarobaariyon ke liye ritern file karne main kaaphi dikkatein aa rahi hai
 It is a complaint of businessmen that the businessmen are facing that they have to fill many forms to file returns
 iske alaava ritern filing kii jo maujuuda vyavastha he, vah kaaphi uljhane vaali he
 Small businesses are not yet able to understand this system properly
 yahi vajah he ki jiesti ritern file karne vaale kaarobaariyon kii sankhya main kaaphi dhimi gati se badhotaree ho rahi he
 Therefore, there is a need to simplify, GST returns are continuously demanding to make the filing easier and easier
 jiesti ritern filing kii prakriya ko saral banane se kaarobaariyon ko suvidha hogi
 Due to this, more business will be able to fill returns
 jiskaa sidhaa parinaam jiesti ke tahat hone vaali filing main ijaphe ke taur par hoga
 What is the new Plan GST Council President and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said that filing GST returns is being made easier
 iske liye shuruyaat main jiestiar-3bi or ek supplai invaais hoga
 He said that it has been discussed in the meeting, but at present it is not being implemented
 taiyaar hoga single formetunhone bataaya ki bihar keupamukhyamantri susheel modiki adhyakshata main bana mantriyon kaa samooh or nandan nilekani ritern ke liye single form kaa behatar formet taiyaar kar sakate hai
 Jaitley said once it is ready it can be approved
 parishad kii yojana ye he ki naye plan ke tahat jiestiar 1, jiestiar 2 or jiestiar 3 ko khatm kiya jayega or isaki jagah kaarobaariyon ko shuruyaat main jiestiar-3bi bharna hoga
 In addition, they will have to upload supply invoices
 or aasaan hoga ritern file karnaek adhikari ne bataaya ki aane vaale samay main is vyavastha ko or durust kiya jayega
 He said that in the coming time, traders may have to upload only supply invoices
 unhone ummid jataai ki abhi masik str par hone vaali ritern filing aane vaale samay main salanaa str par kii ja sakati he
 Currently, they are Form GSTR-1: This is a form of monthly return, in which the businessman has to give details of all types of sales
 jiestiar-2: masik ritern kaa ek or form he, jisamen kaarobaari ko uske str par kii gai kharidari kaa byora dena hota he
 GSTR-3: This form is auto generated based on the details given in GSTR-1 and GSTR-2
 isamen bikri, kharidari ke saath is par lagane vaale jiesti kii puri jaankaree hoti he
 The Gujarat Assembly results were almost the same as the exit polls
 anumaan ke mutabik bijepi sarkaar banane main kaamyaab ho gai
 However, the Congress has also emerged stronger than before
 22 saal baad gujarat main congress satta kii 'dehri' se thodi dur thahar gai
 Now he will have to wait at least five more years for the next withdrawal attempt
 ek tarah se dekhen to desh main gujarat bijepi kaa abhedya durg ban chukaa he
 # 1
 kya gujarat ke jyoti basu hai narendra modi1995 main gujarat ke vidhansabha chunaav main congress ko haraakar BJP ne akele sarkaar banaai thi
 Although the BJP coalition government with Chimanbhai Patel came to power long ago in the state, the alliance did not last long
 2001 main narendra modi ko mukhyamantri banaakar bheja gaya tha
 Since then, this is the fifth election ever fought in the face of Modi and the BJP won it
 agar pashchim bengal main jyoti basu ko dekhen to 1977 main unke netritv main hi vam morcha satta main kabiz hua tha
 The Left Front contested and won on Jyoti Basu's face until Buddhadeb Bhattacharya became the Chief Minister in 2000
 ise agar yun bhi kahen ki jivit rahane tak pashchim bengal main jyoti kaa cheharaa hi vam cheharaa tha to shaayad galat nahin hoga
 She died in 2010 and was ousted by the Mamata Banerjee in the 2011 assembly elections
 33 saal kii satta main bengal main jaise jyoti kaa kaarykaal sabase lanbaa rahaa or wo 'vam abhedya durg' kaa cheharaa rahe
 Similarly, Modi has been in power in Gujarat for 22 consecutive years
 # 2
 How jyoti-modi made his states, how impregnable, Jyoti Basu, who was in power in West Bengal in the 70s, did some things that made Bengal a stronghold of the Left
 jyoti basu ne janhit se jude lokapriy faislon ko pramukhataa di
 Implemented land reforms in the state
 kisaanon ke liye kalyankari kaam kiye
 This impacted in a big way and the Left's penetration in the countryside strengthened
 thik isi tarah gujarat main bhi 'hindutv kaa cheharaa' qaraar die modi ne kai aise faisle kiye jisane vyapak str par aam gujaratiyon ko phayda pahunchaaya
 Industrialization, especially in power, roads and small towns, strengthened their infiltration among the common people
 unke netritv main chhathin baar gujarat membijapi kaa chunaavjeetna is baat kaa saboot he ki aaj bhi modi kaa bharosemand cheharaa logon ko booth tak khinchne main kaamyaab hota he
 # 3
 to bengal kii tarah gujarat main bhi dhah jaataa kilalambe samay se bengal or gujarat vam or bijepi ke liye garh rahe hai
 If we see, after Jyoti left the government, the same kind of public sentiment against the Left government was seen even after Modi left Gujarat
 bataate chalem ki pashchim bengal main buddhadev ke aane ke baad vam sarkaar ne audyogic nivesh ko manjuuri di
 Opposition began in Singur (tata's Nano plant) and Nandigram (chemical Project)
 lalgarh main bhi maovadiyon ke khilaaf ardhsainik balon kii karrwai se janaakrosh bhadkaa
 By the time the Left government could understand public sentiment, it was too late
 2006 main mamata banerjee ne ise mudda banaaya or 2011 aate-aate vam sarkaar ko ukhaad phenki
 Although there was no industrial protest in Gujarat after Modi became the PM, but some such movements arose which aroused public sentiment
 sabase pehle patidaaron ne pichhadaa aarakshan kii maang kii
 Patidar Anamat Reservation Committee was formed under the leadership of Hardik Patel
 patidaar bahul 83 vidhansabha siton main iskaa vyapak asar najar aayaa
 There were several days of protests and incidents of violence
 iske baad oona main gorakshakon dwaara dalit utpeedan kaa maamla saamne aayaa
 Jignesh Mevani raised it as a strong movement against the BJP, including Gujarat, across the country
 unhone 'aazaadee kooch' abhiyaan chalaaya
 But despite such widespread movements, the BJP did not suffer the same loss in the 2017 assembly elections as the Left Front suffered in Bengal
 isaki vajah he
 # 4
 is tarah modi ne bachaaya or bana diya gujarat ko abhedya durgadrasal, gujarat main jab bijepi or modi kii khilaafat shuru hui to modi ne vaisaa ravaiya nahin apanaaya jaisaa ki bengal main vam morche kii sarkaar ne kiya
 If we look at the Patidar movement and the Una scandal, Modi showed political wisdom
 jab patidaar aarakshan ke liye bhadak kar sadak par utar aae modi ne jaldbaaji nahin dikhaai or andolan ko balpurvak kuchalane kii koshish nahin kii
 For this, the agitation was not allowed to be agitated and the Patidar leaders of the party tried to soften the atmosphere further
 anandiben ko turant hataaya bhi nahin gaya
 Following Modi's direction, the BJP slowly worked on the Patidar issue with a cold head
 iskaa asar yah hua ki kaaphi had tak hardik kaa andolan us jwaala ko nahin bhadkaa paaya, jaisaa duusare aandolanon main ho jaaya karata he
 Likewise, Narendra Modi resorted to sentimentality on the issue of oppression against Dalits in Una
 unki bhavuk apil ne daliton ko vah vyapak pratikriya nahin di jisaki bahut zyada ashanka thi
 Modi managed to keep his Gujarat stronghold impenetrable for another five years
 2017 main gujarat main bijepi ko siten bhale hi pichhali baar kii tulana main kam mili hai par yah nahin bhoolanaa chahie ki itihaas ant main sirf jeet hi yaad rakhata he
 Ministry of Agriculture has said that farmers have so far 15 in the current Rabi season
 19 lakh hectare main gehun kii buvaai kii he, jo pichley varsh isi dauraan hui buvaai ke rakabe se dogune se bhi adhik he
 According to the latest data, sowing of wheat in the same period of the previous year 6
 46 lakh hectare main kii gai thi
 Sowing of wheat, the main rabi crop, starts from late October and harvesting starts from April
 shuukravaar ko krishi sachiv ashish bahuguna ne kaha tha ki buvaai main maamuli der ke baavjood abhi tak gehun buvaai kaa rakabaa pichley saal ke str ko laangh gaya he
 If the weather conditions remain good by March, the wheat production is at a previous record of 90 million 48
 8 lakh ton ke str ko laangh jayega
 This record was made in the year 2011-12
 mantralay ke aankadon ke anusaar behatar mausam kii sthitiyon ke kaaran is varsh dalhan kii buvaai kaaphi pehle shuru hui he or kisaanon ne abhi tak 37
 78 lakh hectares have been covered under its cultivation
 pichley varsh is samay tak dalhan kii buvaai shuru nahin hui thi

 "KRK ne likhaa, "chaliye sirf dharti par maujuud jananath main ek khubasurat jindagi jite hai
 "kamal wrote in his second tweet," i did not like Modi Raj, because he was not fulfilling his promises
 ab vah mujhe pasand hai kyonki vah apane vaade puure kar rahe hai or unhone dhara 370 ko khatm kiya he
 i will love him more if he fulfills his second promise also by building Ram temple
 kyonki logon ne unhen unke vaadon ke chalate vot diya he
 "I didn't like Modi's rule because he was not full filling his promises
 Now i like him for full filling his promise and abolished # Article370! i will love him if he will full fill his 2nd big promise also and make # rammandir
 Because people gave him votes for his promises

 Let's live a beautiful life in the Jannat on the earth only
 — KRK (@kamaalrkhan)august 5, 2019ppl shouldn’t have doubt on Muslims for # Kashmirissue
 a single India Muslim is not against the removal of # Article370! Muslims are not allowed to buy property there
 Even Muslims are not allowed to marry with Kashmiri girls
 Means these Kashmiri Muslims don't like us also
 — KRK (@kamaalrkhan)august 5, 2019india will never ever have more clever and powerful politicians than # amitshahji and # narendramodiji! They both are the biggest example of true friendship
 They both did not leave each other in a very bad time also and this is why, today, they are ruling the country
 # Salute👏— KRK (@kamaalrkhan)august 5, 2019I can understand if opposition politicians do oppose government’s wrong act
 But i simply can't understand why they are opposing government for good work like removing # Article370to make India more strong
 Now Kashmir will have more investment, development and employment

 ek bhi musalmaan dhara 370 hataae jane ke khilaaf nahin he

 The BSP president on Wednesday said clearly that his party will not form alliances with the Congress in the three states
 mayawati isi tarah kaa ravaiya agar upi main bhi akhriyaar karti hai to congress ke liye soobe main apane vajood ko bachaae rakhana mushkil sabit ho saktaa he
 UP has the highest importance in gaining power at the center
 pradesh main 80 loksabhaa siten hai
 That is, about one-third of the seats needed to form a government at the Center
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi gathbandhan ne 73 siten jiti thim, tabhi uskaa mishan 272 plus kaamyaab ho paaya tha
 While bsp's account was also not opened
 vahiin, congress raibareli or amethi tak simit ho gai thi or sapa ko sirf apane parivaar kii paanch siten jeet saki thi
 However these results are when the SP, BSP and Congress were in different fray against BJP
 modi kii raah rokane kii koshish2019 main bijepi or piem narendra modi kaa rasta rokane ke liye basapa, sapa, areldi or congress ke netaa saath aane kii baat kar rahe the
 But Mayawati has taken a big jolt to the grand alliance hopes by deciding not to join the Congress in three states
 ise vipakshi ekta ke daavon kii bhi hawa nikal gai he
 In such a situation, in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the BSP will be with the Congress in UP as well, there is a cloud of apprehension on this too
 basapa 2019 ke chunaav main upi main alag hokar ladati he to congress ko bada nuksaan jhelana pad saktaa he
 We can understand this by the results of up's Gorakhpur and Phulpur Lok Sabha by-elections
 in donon siton par sapa ko basapa kaa samarthan tha, lekin congress akele dam par chunavi maidan main thi
 Congress had to fight alone, Congress had to bear the brunt of contesting alone on Gorakhpur and Phulpur seats
 congress ne gorkhupar main surahita kareem maidan main utaara tha, janha unki jamaanat bhi jabt ho gai or unhen sirf 18 hajaar 844 vot mili the
 In Phulpur Lok Sabha seat, Congress fielded Manish Mishra, who got just 19 thousand 353 votes
 jabaki basapa ke samarthan se sapa ne gorakhpur or phulpur donon seat par jeetne main kaamyaab rahi thi
 Interestingly, the Congress is going through its worst phase in the state
 maujuuda samay main congress ke paas upi main do sansadeey seat or 7 vidhayak hai
 This result was when the SP did not field its candidates against the Congress in Amethi and Rae Bareli in the Lok Sabha elections
 iske alaava vidhansabha chunaav main sapa ne congress ke saath gathbandhan karke maidan main utari thi
 Vote Equation In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, BJP single-handedly won 42 seats with 71 seats
 63 fisadi vot hasil kiye the
 While 22 to SP
 35 fisadi voton ke saath mahaj 5 siten jiti thi
 19 to BSP
 7 fisadi vot mili the, lekin ek bhi seat nahin jeet saki thi
 At the same time, Congress 7
 53 fisadi ke saath 2 siten hi jeet saki thi
 If you look at the results of the 2017 assembly elections, BJP scored 39
 7 fisadi voton ke saath 312 siten jeetne main kaamyaab rahi
 While BSP 22
 2 fisadi voton ke saath 19 siten, sapa 22 fisadi voton ke saath 47 or congress 6
 It won 7 seats with 2 percent votes
 congress ko apane vajood bachaane kaa khatrabasapa adhyaksh mayawati ke tevar ko dekhakar lagata he ki wo congress ke saath kisi bhi surat main gathbandhan karne ke mood main najar nahin aa rahi he
 If this happens, then the Congress may have to enter the field alone
 is sthiti main congress ko pradesh main apane vajood ko kaayam rakh paanaa ek badi chunauti hogi

 sarkaar kaa kahana he ki maamle ko fasttrack court main chalaaya jayega
 Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis said, "both the government and the police are acting with full responsibility, the culprits in the case will not be spared
 jald se jald chargeshit daakhil kar doshi ko sazaa di jaaegi

 The Meteorological Department has released estimates that the year 2018 will prove to be better in terms of monsoon and the major southwest monsoon is expected to remain at 97 per cent on an average over the long term during the year
 mausam vibhaag kaa yah akalan jahaan kisaanon ke liye badi raahat kii khabar lekar aayaa he kyonki isse desh kii pramukh kharif fasal majboot hogi, vahiin yah akalan centre main sattarudh modi sarkaar ke liye bhi badi raahat lekar aayaa he
 a good monsoon will give the central government an opportunity to correct its economic data ahead of the general elections due in 2019
 kya he acha monsoon?saamaanya, ausat yaa phir achche monsoon kaa matlab he ki 50 saal kii lambii avadhi ke ausat kaa lagbhag 96 fisadi se 104 fisadi barish kaa hona
 Average rainfall in 50 years is 89 cm or 35 inches of rain during the four months of monsoon
 achche monsoon kii yah paribhaasha mausam vibhaag dwaara di gai he
 At the same time, less than 90 percent of the rain is in drought conditions in the country
 gauratlab he ki pradhanmantri modi ke kaarykaal ke pehle do saal 2014 or 2015 main sookhe kii sthiti rahi or iske chalate desh ke aarthik aankadon main joardaar giravat dekhne ko mili jiske liye kendra sarkaar kii jamkar aalochana kii gai
 According to the Meteorological Department, even 110 per cent rain is not good for the economy, although it does not show the loss of weak monsoon
 adhik barish kii sthiti main fasalon ke kharaab hone kaa khatra bad jaataa he or desh ke kai ilaakon main baadh kii sthiti paidaa ho jaati he
 Importance of Monsoon The monsoon starts from the southern coast of Kerala from June 1, and by the middle of July this monsoon covers the entire country
 is monsoon se desh ko kul vaarshik barish kaa lagbhag 70 fisadi miltaa he
 This rain determines the production of rice, wheat, sugarcane, oilseeds and soyabean, the major kharif crops in the country
 vahiin in fasalon par aadhaarit desh kaa krishi kshetra kul jidipi kaa 15 fisadi he or lagbhag desh kii aadhi jansankhya ko rojgaar is kshetra main miltaa he
 Read this: The liquor crisis in UP, including 'digital India', is lying empty due to these reasons
 vahiin is jansankhya kii badi hui aamadani ke sahare desh main upabhokta utpaadon kii maang main bada ijapha hota he
 This cycle further increases the share prices of agricultural companies in the country and at the same time increases the demand for auto mobiles (motorcycles, tractors, threshers etc
) in rural India
 sudharenge aarthik aankadedesh main june se july tak chalane vaale achche monsoon se arthvyavastha ke kai kshetron par asar padataa he
 India is dependent on itself in food production, so while good monsoon increases kharif crop yields, the government is forced to import food items in the event of poor monsoon and drought
 lihaaja, acha monsoon sarkaar kaa aayaat kharch kam karata he
 The central government is free to spend this money to provide infra development or basic facilities in the country
 in sectors ko hoga bada phydachche monsoon se desh ke gramin ilaakon main kisaanon kii aamadani main ijapha ho jaataa he
 With the increased income, farmers work on buying tractors, buying scooters and motorcycles, buying gold and silver for children's wedding, spending on children's education and higher education
 jiske chalate share bazaar par krishi kshetra kii companiyon ke share main ijaphe ke saath-saath auto sector ke share, farm equipment companiyon ke share samet upabhokta utpaada companiyon ke share main acchhee oochaal dekhne ko milti he
 Read this: Modi government's scheme to be game changer for UP in 2019 elections? Banking will be strong: Good monsoon strengthens banking system in the country
 desh main zyaadaatar kisaan kharif fasal ke liye karj kii vyavastha sarkari, kooparative athwa gramin bainkon se karte hai
 In the event of better monsoon, these banks are guaranteed to get back the loan amount and help them in controlling their npas
 vahiin kisaanon kii badi aamadani se bhi bainkon ko apni gramin shakhaon ke khate main acchhee sevings milti he jisase gaiyr-krishi kshetra ko nayaa karj dene kaa kaam aasaan ho jaataa he
 Inflation will be put on hold that general elections are likely to be held in the country during april-may 2019
 is samay tak acha monsoon apana kaam kar chukaa hoga or kisaan acchhee kharif fasal se badi aamadani ke baad acchhee rabi fasal kii ummid lagaae baitha hoga
 This double bonus before the general elections could help the Modi government return to power once again
 achche monsoon se jahaan desh ke kai aarthik aankadon main sudhaar darj hoga, vahiin is dauraan kendra sarkaar ko mahangaai ke kshetra main bhi badi raahat dekhne ko milegi
 Therefore, with the help of these economic data, no ruling government will face a big challenge in doing the mandate in its favor

 bhale hi abhi tak aap bistar par lead karte aa rahe hon or aapke man main yah baat ho ki aap purush hai or apni saathi se kahin zyada taff or majboot bhi
 You have the power to satisfy them on the bed, so get ready
 kyonki ab aapkaa ye bhram tuutane hi vaala he
 a recent study has revealed that men are stronger, but women are stronger than them
 bhale hi log ab tak ye maanate aae hon ki mahilaayein shaareerik rup se najuk hoti hai, lekin is shodh ke baad sabhi kii maansikta or soch main badlaav aana sambhav he
 And even when it has been proved that women are more powerful than men
 itnaa hi nahin jaankaron kii maane to mahilaayein purushon ke mukaable kahin zyada samay tak jindagi kaa lutf uthaati hai
 The reason behind this has been said to be stronger cells of their body
 jaankaron kii maane to ye koshikaayen behatar tareeke se marammat kaa kaam karti hai
 In the upcoming issue of a magazine called 'scientific American', an article about the research of Tom Kirkwood of Newcastle University and his colleagues is being given
 is lekh main tom or unke saathiyon ke shodh kaa zikr he
 In this research, they have told that the cells of the body of women repair their body more efficiently to give birth to healthy children
 kirkwood ke mutabik, prakruti ne purushon ko jaivik rup se is tarah kaa banaaya ki unki maut jaldi ho jaati he
 According to Kirkwood, the theory is now being accepted that old age is not determined by time

 Among the dead is a woman

 Sources said Murali Dhar Bhai (30), a resident of Odisha, died in the Baltal camp of Ganderbal district in the morning
 ek anya shraddhalu vijay kumaar (55) kii gupha se lautate samay seene me dard hone ke kaaran maut ho gai
 He was a resident of Jammu
 unhone kaha ki haryana nivasee manish jain (36) kii pahalgamv gupha maarg par kal shaam maut ho gai
 Apart from this, Sharmita, who lives in Maharashtra, died in the hospital due to chest pain

 Despite Prime Minister Narendra Modi's instruction not to make controversial statements, the BJP leaders are not coming back
 pehle godse ke mahimamandan ko lekar ghir chuke unnav se bijepi saansad sakshi maharaj ne phir ek vivaadit bayaan dekar ek nayaa raajnneetik vivaad khadaa kar diya he
 This time from a public forum, Sakshi Maharaj said that Hindu women should have at least four children
 sakshi maharaj ke is bayaan se vipaksh ko sarkaar par hamalaa karne kaa ek nayaa mauka mil gaya he
 The Congress on Wednesday alleged that vegetables were first expensive, then the recession in the market and reduced farmers' income, and now Sakshi Maharaj's statement seems that the days of just haters have come
 abhishek manu singhvi ne yahaan tak kaha, bijepi ko bataanaa chahie ki kya wo apana agenda badal rahi he
 Earlier, Union Minister Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti said "is this country for Ramzad or --- Zadas?" Insulted the name Ram by saying
 phir bijepi saansad, yogi adityanath ne chhedaa lav jehad kaa vivaad or ab sakshi maharaj ne phir vahi ghisi-pity baaten doharaa di hai
 You must have also heard the fact that Muslims do four marriages and then produce more children
 lekin ek aadmi ek shaadi kare yaa chaar- ek aurat utane hi bachche paidaa karegi
 Then he marries one man or four men
 ye bilkul simple ganit he
 Secondly, when you look at the census data, one thing will be clear - more than one wife is more among Hindus and less among Muslims
 rahi baat sakshi kii to vahi samajha paaenge ki ye baat chhedane se kisko faaydaa mil rahaa he, lekin vipakshi dalon kaa kahana he ki iskaa jawaab bijepi ke netritv ko bhi dena padegaa ki jahaan pradhanmantri modi kii baat taalane kii himmat bade se bada netaa nahin karata he, vahiin sakshi maharaj, yogi adityanath or sadhvi niranjan jyoti- baar-baar lakshmana rekha paar karne kii himmat kahaan se juta rahe hai? BJP sources repeatedly say that the Prime Minister is angry with such absurd statements
 lekin sawaal ye he, in bayanon ko band karne ke liye party kade qadam kab uthaaegi? Sapna Choudhary's dance has created panic all over the country

 But this TV noise made him popular from house to house

 How is the recruitment drive conducted secretly by Pakistan's intelligence agency ISI? India Today's Special Investigation Team (SIT) in its Exclusive Report on Wednesday exposed the isi's nefarious antics to the world

 Congress leader Siddaramaiah and Congress President Dinesh Gundurao filed a complaint against Shankar to the speaker
 gauratlab he ki congress jedies ke kul 17 vidhayakon ne kumaraswami sarkaar se baghawat kar spikar ko istipha saunp diya tha

 Describing Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's all-odd car scheme as 'useless' to stop pollution in the national capital, Delhi's former Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit said that it would prove to be a complete failure and would further aggravate the problems on the capital's roads
 jalandhar main ek kaarykram main shirkat karne ain dilli kii purv mukhyamantri shila dikshit ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha, sam-visham yojana se pradooshan main koi kami nahin aegi or yah yojana asafal sabit hogi
 He, the position of the Chief Minister of Delhi (arvind Kejriwal) is not clear on this plan
 vah kah rahe hai ki 15 din tak vah ise dekhenge
 This means that they too have doubts over the success of the scheme
 meraa maananaa he ki isse bhrashtachar bhi badhegaa
 The comments dilli main 15 saal tak sarkaar chalaa chukin shila ne kaha, isse dilli kii samasya or badhegi
 There will be more traffic on the roads of the capital
 itnaa hi nahin, baahar se aane vaale car chaalkon ko bhi samasya hogi
 Where will such people park their cars
 iske liye walantirs kii madad lee jaaegi, vah kaise ise sambhaal paaenge, jinhen koi prashikshan tak nahin diya gaya he
 Sheila said that Kejriwal should have come up with a better and holistic plan to reduce or stop pollution, after deliberation, rather than implement the plan only to see it in a hurry
 shila ne kaha ki dilli ek aisa rajya he, jise chalaanaa sabake bas kii baat nahin he
 Only better and only Congress can deliver in Delhi
 anya log keval daawa kar sakate hai
 Former Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dixit, who came to attend an event in Jalandhar, told reporters, "the even-skewed scheme will not reduce pollution and the scheme will fail
" unhone, dilli ke mukhyamantri (arvind kejariwal) kii sthiti is yojana par spasht nahin he
 He is saying that he will watch it for 15 days
 iskaa matlab he ki unhen bhi is yojana ke safal hone par andeh he
 i believe this will also increase corruption
 tippaniyan Sheela, who has run the government in Delhi for 15 years, said, this will increase the problem of Delhi
 rajdhani kii sadakon par or jam lagegaa
 Not only this, car drivers coming from outside will also have problems
 aise log apni car kahaan park karenge
 For this, the help of volunteers will be taken, how can they handle it, who have not been given any training
 shila ne kaha ki kejariwal ko pradooshan kam karne yaa rokane ke liye ek behatar or samgr yojana vichaar-vimarsh ke baad lekar aana chahie tha, na ki aanan-fanan main sirf dekhne ke liye yojana lagu karnaa chahie tha
 Sheila said that Delhi is a state which is not a matter of bus for everyone
 dilli main behatar sarkaar keval or keval congress hi de sakati he
 Others can only claim
 dilli main 15 saal tak sarkaar chalaa chukin shila ne kaha, isse dilli kii samasya or badhegi
 There will be more traffic on the roads of the capital
 itnaa hi nahin, baahar se aane vaale car chaalkon ko bhi samasya hogi
 Where will such people park their cars
 iske liye walantirs kii madad lee jaaegi, vah kaise ise sambhaal paaenge, jinhen koi prashikshan tak nahin diya gaya he

 mental asilam kii kaid main cheekhti ek aawaaj
 
 
 
 
 Eyes full of anger
 
 
 
 
 pagal naa hote hue bhi paaglon jaisi harakatein
 
 
 
 kyon or koun he uski is haalat kaa jimmedaar
 
 
 The story starts with some similar questions
 yun to is tarah kii kahani aap kitabon main pard chuke hai
 But under the direction of director Cherag Ruparel, this psycho thriller story is shown very firmly on screen
 pyaar, fareb, katl, badla, gussa or kuch gahare raaj se bhari ye saali aashiqui kii kahani shuruyaat se lekar aakhir tak ek-ek kar kuch gahare raaj saamne laati he
 Such is the story that Kahani Kahani begins with two students Sahil Mehra (vardhan Puri) and Miti Deora (shivalika Oberoi)
 donon college main ek duusare se pehali baar milte hai
 Sahil gives his heart to seeing Charming and beautiful Mithi
 miti bhi sahil ko chaahane lagati he lekin uske pyaar karne kii vajah sahil kaa decent hona nahin balki paisa hota he
 After getting cheated by Mithi twice, Sahil sees Mitti cheating during the exam and tells his friend Venu (jesse Lever) in a gesture
 venu teacher ko bataata he or teacher miti ko principal ke paas le jaati hai
 This is where Mithi's revenge game begins
 chaalaaki se khelte hue miti-sahil ko pagal sabit karne main kaamyaab ho jaati he or sahil ko shimla mental asilam bhej diya jaataa he
 After living in the Mental Asylum for three years, a truth related to Sahil comes to the fore
 sahil mental asilam main rahakar miti ko kaise sabak sikhaata he, or kaamyaab ho paata he yaa nahin isi kii kahani he ye film
 Many secrets of Sahil and Miti's life emerge in revenge
 kai twists or terns se saji film kii kahani acchhee thriller story bayaan karti he
 vardhan-shivalika's prolific actingcherapa Ruparel has taken two new faces for this psycho thriller story
 donon hi nae chehre hai lekin unki acting ko dekhakar kahin bhi is baat ko mahasoos nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Vardhan Puri has portrayed a man who is innocent in his role as Sahil, has anger in his heart, loves girlfriends and takes his revenge in a very vicious manner despite being honest
 vahiin shivalika oberoi bhi miti ke kairactor main bilkul feet baithti hai
 His acting does not make any fresher feel anywhere
 saporting role main rusalaan mumtaj or jesi liver ne bhi acha kaam kiya he
 The common story's strong launching director, Cherag Ruparel, has neatly shaped the story of a normal boy from psycho to his revenge
 pehle hi seen se film kii kahani hero ke ird-gird gumti he
 Every time you think, is this psycho? Why is it getting so bad with this? The story of the film is predictable but you will be eager to punish the real culprit at the earliest
 ye saali aashiqui pyaar, dhokhaa or badale kii kahani he lekin thodi alag
 Good performance in storeline, background score and direction Background score of the film, good storyline and direction does not bore the audience anywhere
 overol do nae chehron ke saath cherag ruparel ne acha kaam kiya he
 Prateek Shah's cinematography and Anirban Dutta's editing gives excellent exposure to the twists and turns of the film
 film ke ek seen main vardhan apane dada amrish puri ke dilavaale dulhaniya le jaaenge ke seen ko doharaate najar aae
 Vardhan, who feeds the pigeons, reminds him of the scene of his grandfather Amrish Puri
 badhiya mujeepub aate hai gane par
 The song 'hawa Banke' from the film is a beautiful track but here Vardhan's expressionless love seems to fade
 romantic hone ke maamle main vardhan thode kamjor dikhaai die
 Apart from this, the 'freak' song which plays in the background of the film is good
 sahil ke grey shed or seen ke mood ke mutabik is gane ko sahi jagah feet kiya gaya he

 There were 11 candidates, a total of 11 people were trying their luck for the French presidential election

 Lalu is not going to bow down and be afraid
 jab tak aakiri saans he fasivadi taaqaton ke kilaaf ladata rahoonga
 After this tweet, the alliance is not in danger, but shortly after this tweet, Lalu Yadav responded to this tweet and wrote that don't drip too much, the alliance is unbreakable
 abhi to samaan vichaardhaara ke or dalon ko saath jodna he
 i am not afraid of the BJP government and government allies

 is twit ke baad laga kahin gathbandhan khatre main to nahin he lekin is twit ke kuch der baad hi lalu yadav ne apane isi twit par jawaab dete hue likhaa ki zyaada laar mat tapakaao, gathbandhan atoot he
 Right now, more like-minded parties have to be joined together

 RSS-BJP is left shivering in the name of Lalu
 inako pataa he ki lalu inke jhooth, lut or jumalon ke kaarobaar ko dhwast kar rahaa he to dabaav banaao
 However, by the evening when the news of the break-up of the Grand Alliance did not stop in the media, finally RJD national spokesman Manoj Jha spoke to reporters
 jha ne kaha ki lalu prasad or rajd is prakaar kii gidad bhabhakiyon se darane vaale nahin hai
 We know what is happening in the country
 lalu prasad, arvind kejariwal, mamata banerjee kii aawaaj ko band karne kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 The voice will not end and now Awam will take this fight in his hand

 Under this, the party organized a rally at Gandhi Maidan in Patna today after 30 years
 is raily main rashtriya janata dal ke tejasvi yadav samet mahagathbandhan ke anya netaa shaamil hue
 Addressing this rally, Congress President Rahul Gandhi fiercely targeted the Modi government
 unhone bajet main kisaanon ke liye kii gai ghoshnaaon ko unka apmaan bataaya
 He said that the Modi government gives a lot of money to the capitalists, but gives 17 rupees to the farmers
 yah kisaanon kaa apmaan he
 Taking a dig at the Modi government, Rahul Gandhi said that demonetisation is the biggest scam in the world
 modi kehete hai ki har aadmi ko 15 lakh denge, lekin yahaan koi aisa he jise mila he
 He said that the opposition government is coming to Bihar
 iske gahare kaaran hai
 Where Modi goes, he makes big promises
 nitish ji kii bhi yahi aadat he
 But promises are not fulfilled
 congress netaa ne kaha ki kisaan ko 17 rupee dena unka apmaan karnaa he
 Taunting the Congress president, the Modi government made a big announcement in the budget
 bijepi ke netaaon ne kaha ki aitihaasik nirnay liya he, or paanch minute tak unhone dhadadhad taaliyaan bajaain
 He did historical work for the farmers
 modi ji yun tali baja rahe hai
 Do you know what historical work he has done? 17 rupees given to the farmers and three and a half rupees a day for the farmer's family
 
 
 to modi ji kii sarkaar ne kisaanon ko ye die or bijepi ke mantri dhadadhad sansad main tali bajaate hai
 Rahul Gandhi said that the Modi government gives Rs 30,000 crore to Anil Ambani, Rs 35,000 crore to Nirav Modi and Rs 10,000 crore to Vijay Mallya, but gives three and a half rupees to the farmers of Hindustan
 modi sarkaar kaa yahi aitihaasik faisla he? rahul gandhi ne kaha ki modi ji ne deshavaasiyon se 15 lakh rupee dene kaa vaada kiya tha, lekin kisi ke khate main ye paise aae kya? modi sarkaar ne 17 rupee dekar kisaan kaa apmaan kiya he
 Raheul Gandhi said that i do not make a false promise
 aaj patna uniwarsity kii haalat kharaab he
 We will give Patna University Central University status as soon as we come to power
 unhone kaha ki pehle bihar shiksha kaa centre hota tha, aaj berogari kaa centre he
 If you go to Gujarat, go to Maharashtra, then the BJP people chase you away
 ham bihar ko phir gauravshaalee banaaenge
 The Congress leader said that earlier the Green Revolution started from punjab-haryana, now i want the next Green Revolution to be in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and also include the name of Bihar
 maine rajasthan, madhya pradesh, chhattisgarh ke mukhyamantriyon ko kah diya he ki kisaan ke liye food processing unit lagaaie
 If you give us a chance, we will also make the farmers of Bihar prosper
 tejasvi bole-rahul gandhi banenge pmvahim tejasvi yadav ne raily ko sambodhit karte hue kaha ki congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi kii jimmedaari he ki kis tarah se sahyogi dalon ko saath lekar chalanaa he
 Because everybody has to defeat BJP together
 is dauraan tejasvi yadav modi sarkaar or bijepi par jamkar barase
 He said that my father is a lion

 The RJD leader said that people ask us that you will accept Rahul Gandhi as PM
 main unhen bataanaa chahta hum ki rahul gandhi pradhanmantri ke yogya hai
 He is a worthy leader
 lekin unhen sahyogiyon ko lekar kaise chalanaa he, isaki bhi unki jimmedaari he
 Significantly, before reaching the stage, Rahul Gandhi laid flowers on the statue of Mahatma Gandhi
 iske baad vah manch pahunche, jahaan bihar congress or mahagathbandhan ke netaaon ne unka swaagat kiya
 Explain that after 30 years, the Congress organized this rally in Patna on its own
 isse pehle 1989 main congress ke divangat netaa rajeev gandhi ne isi gandhi maidan main raily kaa aayojan kiya tha
 The Congress gave full strength to make this rally a success
 patna kii sadakon or chauraahon ko postaron va bannron se paat diya gaya
 Many opposition mps from Congress mlas to Bihar have been involved in making this rally a success
 congress kii ranneetiam chunaav 2019 main ab bahut thodaa vakt bachaa he
 The Congress, along with the Grand Alliance in Bihar, is setting up a board to defeat the pair of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Nitish
 bijepi or jediu ne pehle hi 17-17 siton par bantwaaraa karke apni chaal chal di he
 Now the command is with Rahul
 rahul nai ranneeti ke saath maidan main hai
 The success of the rally will be helpful for the Congress on many fronts simultaneously
 lihaaja party ke 27 vidhayakon ne puri takat jhonk di he
 This will not only send a new message to the voters in Bihar, but it will also increase the strength in the bargaining of seats with the allies
 is shakti pradarshan par endie kii nigahen to jami hi he
 But at the same time, the eyes of the parties of the Grand Alliance are fixed

 Let's talk about him the most
 uske bare main sab kuch jaananaa chaahate hai
 This is the nature of human beings
 cricket ke diwane desh ko sachin tendulkar ke sanyas ke baad ek "iken" kii talash he, jise wo "god" bananaa chahta he
 Cricket lover finding God in Virat "chiku" Kohli's unlimited talent
 jab "sledging" ko lekar maidan par viraat kaa gussa futataa he, to desh ko apane "engri yang main" par naaz hota he
 The public becomes obsessed with his mood by answering brick with stone
 clin bold ho jane ke baad bhi jab viraat ko ye yakeen nahin hota ki wo out the, to jeetne kii zid or kabhi haar nahin maanane ke unke zazbe ko salaam karne ko ji chahta he
 After the defeat, the most disappointment can be read on the face of any cricketer, then they are none other than Virat Kohli
 viraat kohli main wo sab kuch he, jo ek mahaan khilaadi main hone chahie
 But there are many that do not want to become great
 'bada' bananaa to tay he hi, lekin choti-choti baton par unki tikhi pratikriya kahin unke 'mahaan' banane kii raah main speed-braker banakar na aa jaae
 After the World Cup semifinal loss, Virat was upset with what happened on social media about his girlfriend Anushka Sharma, which is also justified
 kolkata main unka gussa foot padaa, "mujhe bahut dukh hua
 Shame on those who said so
 "viraat itane gusse main the ki ve yahaan tak kah gaye ki is ghatana ke baad unhen achche-bure logon kii pahchaan ho gai, "ek match main karaab pradarshan kii ye qeemat? mere liye pratikriyaayein behad niraashajanak thim

 The "success" has been overwhelming as a captain
 
 
 lekin shemilt kii jubaan ladkadaayi or unke munh se "saxes" kii bajaae "sex" nikal gaya
 Clark and Steven Smith all laughed at the press conference
 clark kii vakpatutaa or hazirajvaabi se siikhaa ja saktaa hai
 He said that the question of "sex" should be asked by his wife! Like thousands of young cricketers, Kohli continues to consider Sachin Tendulkar as his ideal
 sachin ke khelte dekhakar bade hue hai
 Like millions of sports lovers, did Kohli not expect that Sachin would return by scoring a century? aisi hi ummid viraat kohli se bhi kii jane lagi he
 Therefore, the scale of their form is different from other players
 kohli ne media ko aade haathon lete hue kaha ki khilaadiyon ke form ko lekar media ke alag-alag paimaane hai
 One scale for a player and something else for another
 "agar main do match main bhi kharaab khelun to meraa form kharaab bataaya jane lagata he
 Some players remain in form even after playing 2 matches in 10 matches
 "24 saal tak sachin tendulkar kii cricket kii duniya main tuuti bolti rahi, lekin ve khud bahut kam bole
 His bat answered every question
 yaad he na 2006 main hi ek aalochak ne likh diya tha -"endulkar"
 Sachin still remained silent and kept playing for the next 7 years and the critics kept hiding
 "pichley 5 saal main mujhase zyaada kisi ne bhi match nahin jitaaye hai
 i don't think anybody's performance in the team has been better than me
 " jab viraat kohli aise bayaan dete hai to isamen unka aatmavishvaas kam, dambh zyaada mahasoos hota he
 Virat Kohli is seen wandering the "path of greatness" with high hopes

 is dauraan narendra modi ne congress par hamalaa bolte hue kaha ki do dashak pehle congress ne shivasena ke sansthaapak bal thakare kaa vot dene kaa adhikaar chin liya
 The Congress hit back at the Prime Minister's statement and said that Thackeray's franchise was snatched not by the Congress but by the Election Commission
 gauratlab he ki latur ke ousa shahar main mangalvaar ko pradhanmantri modi or uddhav thakare kii ek saajha raily yojit kii gai jisamen mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis bhi maujuud rahe
 Earlier, Modi and Thackeray were seen together on December 24, 2016 during the 'jalapooja' ceremony of the proposed Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's grand memorial in the Arabian Sea
 tab unhone bandra kurlaa complex main janata ko sambodhit bhi kiya tha
 During his address at the rally, Prime Minister Narendra Modi questioned the Congress manifesto and in the same order he also raised the issue of Bal Thackeray's right to vote
 pradhanmantri ne kaha ki congress raaj main bal thakare ko vot dene se vanchit kiya gaya
 The Congress reacted sharply to this
 aapako bataa den ki 90 ke dashak main bal thakare se vot dene kaa adhikaar chin liya gaya tha
 He was accused of appealing to vote in the name of religion in a public meeting
 pradhanmantri ne mangalvaar ko latur main kaha ki congress jaisi partiyaan jo vanshavaad ko badhaava detii hai, unhen bala sahab se sikh leni chahie
 Narendra Modi called Bal Thackeray his elder brother and said that Shiv Sena founder Bala Saheb never considered himself a contender for the post of Chief Minister nor did he ever forward his elder son for this
 modi kii is baat par congress ne tikhi pratikriya di or kaha ki pradhanmantri ne bhaashan main jo kaha wo galat tathy he
 Bal Thackeray's right to vote was not taken away by the Congress, but by the Election Commission
 bharat ke itihaas main pehali baar kisi kaa matadhikaar chhina gaya tha kyonki 92 ke dangon ke baad bal thakare lagaataar bhadakaau bhaashan de rahe the
 Prior to the 1999 election, the Election Commission warned him several times and later imposed a 6-year ban on voting and contesting elections
 pradhanmantri modi ne latur main kaha ki congress kaa chunaav ghoshnaptr nehru-gandhi parivaar kii chauthi peedi ko surakshit karne ke liye he, jabaki bijepi kaa ghoshnaptr vikaas ke liye he
 Addressing a rally, Narendra Modi said that his party's manifesto is for the next five years, while the Congress manifesto will cease to exist on May 23, when the results of the Lok Sabha elections are out
 pradhanmantri ne yah bayaan congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ke us twit ke jawaab main diya jisamen unhone bijepi ke ghoshnaptr ko bina vijan vaala bataaya tha
 Rahul had said that the Congress' manifesto has been prepared after deliberations
 lagbhag 10 lakh logon kii aawaaj se bana ghoshnaptr shaktishaalee or samajhadaari bharaa he
 In response to this, Narendra Modi termed the election manifesto of the Congress as a 'fraud letter' to get votes, while he called the bjp's resolution letter as voters

 But Uttarakhand Chief Minister Harish Rawat has been successful in stopping the Modi wave here
 yahaan congress ko teen saal main apane boote vidhansabha main bahumat mil gaya he
 Congress candidate Mamta Rakesh won the election from Bhagwanpur seat of Haridwar parliamentary constituency
 unhone apane nikatatam pratidwandvi raajapaal ko 36,909 maton se haraaya
 This assembly seat was vacant after the death of Uttarakhand cabinet minister and BSP MLA Surendra Rakesh
 congress ne divangat surendra rakesh kii patni mamata rakesh ko is seat se chunaav main maidan main khadaa kiya
 The people there sympathized with him
 is jeet ke saath uttarakhand main harish ravat kaa rajnatik kad bhi bad gaya he
 In the 2012 general elections, the Congress had lost just four seats by a majority
 party ne bispi, uttarakhand kranti dal (ukrand) or teen nirdaleey vidhayakon kii madad se sarkaar banaai thi
 In lieu of this, the associate legislators also had to give ministerial posts
 iske baad alag-alag samay main rajya main paanch vidhansabha siton par upachunaav hue
 In all these by-elections, the Congress won continuously and the party's position in the Assembly continued to strengthen
 ab congress ko nirdaleey or ukrand vidhayakon kaa sahyog lene kii jarurat nahin rah gai he
 There is a pressure on Harish Rawat to remove ministerial posts from this quota and give Congress ministers the post of ministers
 ravat is jeet ko congress kii nitiyon kii sweekaaryata ke rup main dekhte hai
 He says, "we faced the challenges together, we met them together

 haar ke baavjood 2012 ke chunaavon ke mukaable is chunaav main bijepi ke vot pratishat main badhotaree hi hui he
 According to Nishank, the bsp's exit from the election ground has had an impact on the election results
 ve kehete hai, ''agar yah chunaav bispi banaam bijepi hota to nattejey kuch or hi hote
 Leader of Opposition Ajay Bhatt also cites political reasons behind the Congress victory
 ve kehete hai, ''sattadhari congress ne chunaav main jeet ke liye sarkari mashinari kaa jamkar durupyog kiya or naitikta ko puri tarah taak par rakh diya tha
 "whatever the reason the BJP may now give for its defeat, the truth is that the mandate is against the BJP
" ab party 2017 ke chunaavon main apni jeet ke mishan ko puraa karne kaa daawa kar rahi he, lekin andar kii kahani kuch or hi he
 Many BJP mlas are said to be in touch with the ruling Congress even today
 purula, uttarkashi se bijepi vidhayak malchand or dhanolti, tehri se vidhayak bhimlaal arya to khuleam congress kii tarif karte hai
 However, riding on the Modi wave, the BJP won all the five seats in the Lok Sabha elections
 jeet se utsahit party ne khud ko mishan 2017 kaa daavedaar bataanaa shuru kar diya
 After that, there was a BJP membership campaign at the national level
 badi sankchaya main nae sadsy bane, phir bhi chunavi nattejey mishan 2017 ko saakaar karte hue nahin dikh rahe
 The biggest problem of the BJP is that the party is not able to overcome factionalism
 party ke teenon purv mukhyamantri alag-alag dishaao main jate hue dikhaai dete he
 It is not that the Congress is not a victim of factionalism and infighting
 lekin congress netritv ne samay-samay par apni sulajhi hui siyaasi ranneeti ko sabit kiya he
 The Congress won the vacated Doiwala seat of former Chief Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal 'nishank' who left the assembly seat for the Lok Sabha elections

 BJP MLA Kiran Mandal from Sitarganj seat himself left that seat for Vijay Bahuguna
 itnaa hi nahin, rajya ke gram panchayat chunaavon main bhi congress ko jeet hasil hui he
 On the condition of anonymity, a BJP leader says that the party has gathered an army of leaders, not workers
 modi ne rajya main shankhanaad raily to kii, lekin uttarakhand se kiye vaade puure karnaa to dur, party ke kisi saansad ko sarkaar main jagah dene se bhi parhez kiya
 Atal Bihari Vajpayee's government had two ministers of state
 aise main kaaryakarta logon ke bich kya kahkar vot maangane jaaen
 After three years, the Congress has got a majority in the Uttarakhand Assembly, but the path ahead is not so easy
 agle vidhansabha chunaav main is pradarshan ko dohraane ke liye congress ko lambii duuri tay kerani hogi

 The Bombay High Court, while dismissing the petition of a husband urging divorce due to the weight of his wife, ruled that weight gain after marriage cannot be the basis of divorce
 talaak maangane ke kaaran main kaha gaya tha ki patni ne pati se vivaah purv breast surgery karaane kii baat chhipaai thi, jiske kaaran baad main uskaa vajan bahut bad gaya
 The husband had complained that he could not enjoy marital life because of his wife's problem
 yachika main pati ne aarope lagaaya tha ki vivaah ke baad patni kaa vajan teji se badhane laga
 He argued that he persuaded the wife to seek treatment, but the wife refused to cooperate
 usne kaha tha ki uski patni aksar ghar kaa kaam karne se manaa kar detii thi or phir vah kaam use karnaa padataa tha
 He alleged that the wife never fulfilled his wishes and did not fulfill the obligation of being a wife
 baharhaal, adaalat ne kaha ki pati ne sweekaar kiya tha ki unka vivaah purnataa tak pahunchaa
 a bench of Justices MS Sonak and AS Oka said that her (husband's) complaint was simply that his wife was overweight and that this could not be the basis of the divorce
 adaalat ne yah bhi kaha ki pati ke yah aarope vaivaahik jivan ke saamaanya utaar-chadhaav ko bataate hai ki patni kaa swabhaav jhagadaalu tha or vah ziddee thi
 According to the court, this cannot be the basis of divorce

 After the tensions in the relationship, the husband applied for divorce in the family court
 adaalat ne aavedan thukraa diya
 The husband then applied to the High Court, which dismissed her appeal on the grounds that the increase in weight could not be the basis for divorce
 pati ne kaha ki vah sholapur main ek marij beuro ke jariye patni se mila tha
 According to him, the wife did not disclose in the form that she underwent breast surgery
 surgery ke kaaran vivaah ke baad uskaa vajan bahut bad gaya
 The wife argued that there was no column in the form in which she could tell that she had undergone surgery
 usne kaha ki pati se yah baat chhipaane kaa uskaa iraadaa nahin tha
 She denied the husband's allegation that before marriage the husband had asked her if she had undergone any major surgery, and yet she did not mention the surgery
 patni ne adaalat ko bataaya ki uske parivaar ke logon ne uske pati ko surgery ke bare main vivaah se pehle bataa diya tha

 # indveng rajdhani washington main sikh pulicekarmiyon ko unke pagadi, dadhi sahit anya dharmik chihnon ke saath kaam karne kii ijaajat mil gai he
 Washington dc's Police Chief Kathy Lanier released the new uniform policy on Wednesday
 iske saath hi washington america kaa pehla aisa shahar ban gaya he jahaan sikh pulicekarmi dharmik chihnon ke saath kaam karte dikhenge
 This policy has been formulated in collaboration with the Sikh American Legal Defense and Education Fund (SALDEF)
 iske anusaar pulicekarmi unifarm ke rang kii pagadi pahanenge jisapar vibhaag kaa baij laga hoga
 He will also be allowed to keep a beard
 kathi ne kaha, "achche police adhikariyon kii kami ko dekhte hue vyaavhaarik rukh apanaaya gaya he
 Now suitable candidates will be given preference
 " He said, "there are 3800 Sikh policemen in Washington
 " kathi ne kaha ki police prashikshan santhaan main prashikshan le rahe ek sikh ke rigerv adhikari banane kii yojana ko tyaagate hue bhartee ke liye nivedan karne se utsahit hokar yah nai niti laai gai he
 SALDEF Executive Director Jasjit Singh said that this directive from a premier institution of the country will serve as an example to other institutions
 tippaniyan He said that Sikhs are fighting for their religious rights in other parts of the country
 iske liye singh ne trephic police main bhartee ke raste kholane ke liye sikh samudaay dwaara nau saal pehle neuyark main mukadmaa daayar karne kaa bhi udhaaharan diya
 The Sheriff Department of Las Angeles County has allowed Sikhs to become just Reserve Police Officers
 is niti kaa nirmaan sikh american legal dephence and ajukeshan fund (eseeldf) ke sahyog se kiya gaya he
 According to this the policemen will wear uniform color turban which will have a badge of the department
 unhen dadhi rakhane kii bhi anumati hogi
 Kathy said, "given the lack of good police officers, a practical stand has been taken
 ab naukari ke uchit ummidavaaron ko variyata di jaaegi
 " unhone kaha, "washington main 3800 sikh pulicekarmi hai
 "kathy said that this new policy has been brought up, excited by requesting for recruitment, abandoning the plan of a Sikh undergoing training at the Police Training Institute to become a Reserve Officer
 eseeldf ke kaaryakari nideshak jasjit singh ne kaha ki desh kii ek pramukh sanstha kii taraf se aayaa yah nirdesh anya sansthaaon ke saamne udhaaharan kaa kaam karegaa
 The comments unhone kaha ki desh ke anya bhaagon main sikh apane dharmik adhikaron kii ladaai lard rahe hai
 For this, Singh also cited the example of the Sikh community filing a lawsuit in New York nine years ago to open avenues for recruitment to the traffic police
 las agenlis county ke sheriff vibhaag ne sikhon ko sirf rigerv police adhikari banane kii ijaajat di he

 When Lionel Messi was 11 years old, his family had to seek medical advice because of his physical development
 pita jorge or maa celia kii santan mesi 16 varsh baad aaj footbal ke apane adarsh diego maradona ke padchinhon par chalate hue fifa vishwa cap ke final main apane desh kii team kaa netritv kar rahe hai
 According to the news agency Xinhua, due to the lack of hormones necessary for development, Messi's family went to the doctor to ask if Messi would be able to grow so long that he could play football
 tab chikitsak kaa jawaab tha, 'chintaa mat karo, ek din tum maradona se lambey hooge
 In football, you will not be better than them, but you will definitely be longer than them
 ' In fact, Messi is four centimeters taller than his ideal Maradona
 lekin 16 varsh baad aaj mesi chikitsak dwaara us samay kahi gai baat ko puri tarah jhuthalane par amada hai
 On Sunday, Messi will lead his team against Germany in the title match of FIFA World Cup-2014
 footbal main pehle hi apni pratibha kaa loha manavaa chuke mesi ke liye yah ek or badi uplabdhi hogi
 Messi, who made his 2004 debut for Barcelona, has since won three Uefa Champions League titles, six La Liga titles and twice the Spanish Cup
 vyaktigat taur par mesi record chaar baar duniya ke sarvshereshth khilaadi kaa award bailan di or bhi praapt kar chuke hai
 Despite so many achievements, Messi has been accused of not being able to repeat his performance in the club tournament while playing in his national team
 mesi isse pehle fifa vishwa cap-2006 ke quarter final main mejabaan se penalty shootout main haarane vaali argetini team kaa hissaa rah chuke hai
 Even in the last World Cup in South Africa, Messi could not score a goal and his team once again lost to Germany in the quarter-finals
 argentina ke liye unke pradarshan ko dekhte hue kai log kehane lage the ki maradona se mesi kii koi tulana ho hi nahin sakati
 Maradona actually made Argentina a world champion in 1986 on his own
 uske agle varsh vah vishwa cap main final tak kaa safar tay karne main kaamyaab rahe, lekin unhen germany se haar kar khitaab se vanchit rahanaa padaa tha
 In such a situation, the debate has once again gained momentum whether Messi will be able to prove that he is better than the legendary Argentine player Maradona at the Marakana Stadium on Sunday
 vishwa cap-1990 main argentini team ko haraane vaale germany ke tatkaaleen coach franj bekenbor ne shuukravaar ko kaha, 'yah bahut hi mushkil tulana he
 But Maradona was a far better player than today's Messi
 ' kaha to ja rahaa he ki yah mesi kii aakhri agnipariksha ke samaan he

 It is not that the boss has enmity with the accused, he firmly believes that these are prohibited things and his recovery from someone's house in large quantities proves his being a Maoist
 usase bahes kijiye or vah puri nishtha se batalaayegaa ki vah samaaj ko bhay mukt karne or sabko suraksha dene ke liye hi in kathin ilaakon main apana tabadalaa kara aayaa he

 But why should the art won in the guise of having a sensitive, all-encompassing vision be pronounced on this uniformed person? The poem has been an essential accompaniment of rebel and rebel
 usne khud ko hameshaa satta ke aakhri vipaksh bataur prastaavit, pratisthapit kiya, lekin is anivaaryta ne kya uski nigaah ko nishpaksh rahane diya? satta kaa anushanbee hona agar shabd ke liye sabase bada kufr he to satta se sarvakalik andeh kaa sambandh bhi sayaanaapan nahin
 And if you have taken doubt as the religion of the word, then you should start with doubt on your own eyes, with recognition
 tab shaayad satta ke andekhee pahalu bhi dikhalaai denge, sthapanaaon ko chunauti dete huye
 For example, the police help journalists most in reporting on the battlefield, protecting them from danger
 jangal main kahin internat, fax, tasviir scan karne ityadi kii suvidha nahin to espi yaa colector kaa offis hi khabar bhejne kaa sahaara hota he
 Camera and laptop battery are charged from the station's generator
 pulisiye ko maaloom hota he jo khabar reporter uske daftar ke computer par tip kar rahaa he, prashasan ke hi virodh main jaayegi ki vah jo kaagaj chori chupe scan kar rahaa he
 Actually, they are flying from a file of the police station, sending pictures in haste, they are secretly taken pictures of an injured prisoner locked in lockup, which will be pampered as soon as it is printed in the newspaper but the policeman ignores it
 agar sipaahi ishaara bhi kare to kahata he- ‘kar lene do, mediavaale hai
 
 
 We are doing our work
 
 
 bhala hi hoga sabakaa
 'surprising, but reporting in inaccessible places is impossible without the help of police-administration intelligence
 yah wo khufia lamhe hai jab khaaki apane dharmagranth ko dheel detii he, aapako avasar dete huye ki aap us par hamalaa kar saken
 If the universally accepted cruel khaki has left an exception and a place of emergency in its constitution, should not the self-proclaimed sensitive art rethink its vision and relation to power? When the poet discovers the father in the bus driver, seeing the image of his daughter in a bangle hanging in front of the steering, why be untouched by the gunman? Lahna Singh was also a soldier
 duusare, sipaahi kaa dosha shaayad faqat itnaa ki vah kisi ek kitaab par antim aasthaa liye ji rahaa he
 Assuming a scripture to be the last, whether it proclaims divine authority or the archetype of a thought man, divides the creation into opposite poles
 agar aapako kisi niamak vyavastha main jeena he to kisi kitaab ko hona hi hoga, jiske harf us samooche dhaanche ko vaidhata-vaidhaniktaa denge
 You quote Adam Smith, Gita, Marx or Hind Swaraj
 vyavastha kaa sabase chota kalpurja bhi khud ko satyapit adipustak se hi karegaa
 So either get out of every kind of system and if practical-social factors tell that the structure is unhelpful, then the essential duality relation to this structure is useless
 vah bindu khojane hi honge jahaan vilom dikhalaai dete avyav se bhi samvaad ho sake
 After all, how many poets will be there who will sit in your house with respect, give them a table chair, paper-pan, computer-scanner so that you can write against it, expose it? pat jhar
 Now no water
 --- kabaki ai tu?--- subah andhere, tu hi to bolaa tha mahuye ke neeche milanaa
 
 
 Where was it? Everybody has come to see
 
 
 khatm ho jaayegaa mahua sara
 --- No one has fallen a lot today
 chal shuru karte hai
 Used to be on the autumn day
 unke jangal main dher jharta tha, patjhar
 Mahua dripping from four to eleven in the morning
 safed chota phool
 Used to be scattered on the earth
 mahue kaa ped khaali hota jaataa
 Both would get up early
 neeche bikhri sukhi laal pattiyon ke bich mahua been tokari main bharte jate
 This tree was strange puure saal kaa khumaar is mausam main udel detaa
 They gleaned the seeds of intoxication from the earth
 puure saal kii hasarat apni jhonpadi ke peeche ikaitha karte
 Night snaps at the tip of Mahue's magical braid
 jangal unka kaajal tha, nadi geela mahavar jisamen dub ve apni deh kaa surkh shringaar karte
 Those leaves were but is janvari vah ek thane main mara paaya gaya
 The policeman said that he was a Naxalite, committed suicide in the hanging
 kai mile dur jangal ko cheer kar aayaa puraa gaanv umad padaa
 On the road
 postmortem ke baad laash sarkari ambulance main jagadalpur se dantewada hoti aa rahi thi
 The ambulance had deliberately taken a long way to evade the villagers, to be cremated quietly
 sabko lekin khabar ho gayi thi, laththe daal sadak roak di gayi thi
 An ambulance arrived
 viraat chitkaar, vikaraal rudan
 The women of the village climbed inside the car - a body wrapped in white under the glass
 striyaan kaanch ko muththiyon se peethtin thim
 Glass used to hit the glass
 chuudi chatak kar tuutati thim, taabut kaa kaanch majboot tha
 Probably because it was official
 vah sadak kinare sir jhukaaye baithi thi
 Silent bundle
 beharkat
 She did not know me
 use nahin maaloom tha main das ghante dur raipur se raat ko chal vahaan aayaa hum, mere paas uske pati kii medical report he ki use mrityu se pehle beintahaa peeta gaya tha, uske guptangon par sujan thi, samooche bastar ke kisi thane main uske khilaaf kabhi koi maamla darj nahin hua tha, kahin uskaa naam nahin tha, faansee lagane ke liye uske paas hawalat main koi rassi nahin thi, sirf ek shawl jise thodaa cheer usne khud ko daravaaje ke mahaj teen foot oonche kunde se taang liya ki us shawl kii tasviir he mere paas or hawalat ke daravaaje kii bhi
 Unaware she was sitting silently
 ‘naksali’ pati ke chinh apane bheetar sahej
 Tilt the head between the knees stuck in the arms
 agali subah mere akhbaar ne pehle panne par uski tasviir chhaapi thi khabar ke saath- pati kii laash kii pratiksha karti garbhvatee stri
 On the second day, the notice of the Human Rights Commission came to the state government
 yah lekin do maheene puraani baaten hai
 The leaves springs again this year
 mahua phir tapakataa he
 Today, on the morning of March 18, she goes alone with a basket and picks white flowers
 vah ab bhi waisi hi he
 Silently
 pet par ubhaar thodaa adhik hua he
 Maybe
 do sau chalis din kii santan bhi apni upasthiti uski kaaya par nahin batala paati
 It is the conception of hunger
 garbh kaa bhukhshastra
 Probably it will be said at the height of the cosmopolitan woman - if you have become a bit fat, do dieting
 mahanagaron kii santane sauven din se pehle hi apni ghoshnaa kar detii hai
 The dialectical legislation of Daurbalya v
 Soudhava is determined before birth
 is lamhe ko ji chuki apane parivaar kii striyaan yaad aati hai
 Wears a siege gown
 achak kar chalati hai
 Some things keep on sticking throughout the day
 vah lekin akeli mahua binti he
 Handles herself by herself
 chupchaap
 Amidst dense hills
 parason use dhai ghante kii ludhakti ladkadaati bas main chal colector offis janaa he, babu kii khidki par line main hona he pati kaa mrityu pramaan patr lene
 Many times have gone before but the date goes forward
 ‘naksali’ pati kaa mrityu pramaan patr jila mukhyalay lene jaati stri ne chalati bas main bacchee ko janm diya
 Is this still to happen? Many years will pass, the girl will also be mahua
 apane pita ko poochhegi
 Once she starts wearing a frock, one day the mother will take her to the police station, where the father has finished himself with a shawl
 ‘nirmal ne kabhi mahue kii muskuraahat likhaa tha, mahue kii mrityu upyukt rahata
 'his little read brother-in-law has left his work in Madras and has come here
 usne mujhe is ilaake main ghoomte dekha to jhat pahchaan gaya- aap hi aaye the na janvari main
 Took him home, said he will stay here now, will not let the elder brother die
 man hua batalaauun vah kis dhansakati jameen par atka he
 In the last two months, he has not been able to get the post-mortem report
 yah sangharsh mahaj aantarik he, aatm-tushti ke sivaay kuch nahin detaa, na degaa
 Satisfaction of being able to stay, even if it is scratched, only a blank breeze is seen inside
 thandi, sukhi hawa jiske thaped main safed phool bikhare chale jate hai
 He does not know how weak the arrogance of self-confident efforts on which he hangs this corpse
 saal biit jaaen, pairmapaara main rahete vah adhikadhik itnaa kar paayegaa ki colector, espi yaa sthaneey parshad yaa vidhayak ko ekaadh gyaapan de aayegaa
 The photostat acknowledgment of that memo will be the official stamp which he will save in his file, if you come here like me, it will be shown
 puri kahani shuru se sunaayegaa
 One night Argani will break, the dried up corpse will fall
 yah lamhaa shabd-paurush kaa gumaan bhi dhwast karata he, swikaarne ko baadhya karata he ki shabd ek nirviy satta he

 The villagers saw them standing dangerously on the rock and talking

 Only one of the villagers made a video from mobile
 ye sab chal hi rahaa tha or police kaa intazaar ho rahaa tha ki ladke ne achaanak ladki kaa haath pakad kar chattan se chalaang laga di
 The villagers somehow climb the rocks and reach the first girl and save her
 baad main police ke pahunchane par ladke ko bhi bachaa liya jaataa he
 The boy is 19 years old and studies in polytechnics
 vahiin ladki naaballig bataai gai he
 It is a privilege that the boy or girl did not get any more serious injuries

 Diesel prices, like petrol, will be set by oil companies

 That is, diesel prices will fall here when international crude oil prices fall
 is tarah se petrol-dijal ke daam ab bazaar kii shaktiyon par nirbhar rahenge

 On the other hand, Hindus living in Russia believe that the government deliberately spread confusion about the Gita as it is
 pichley saal 28 disambar ko tomusk kii loar court ne gita par bain kaa virodh karanevaali yachika khaarij kar di
 The matter also arose during Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's visit to Russia in December
 udhar, bharat par likhanewaale 20 roosi vidwaanon ne apni sarkaar ko bain na lagane kaa suzav diya he
 The comments rus main aarope laga ki bhagavad 'gita age it ij' main limb nasl rashtriyata or bhashaa kaa bhedbhaav he isliye siberia ke tomusk main maamla gaya
 The petition sought to ban this translation of the Gita from being included in the list of radical material, to prevent its publication, printing and distribution
 rus main gita ko lekar uthe vivaad par loksabhaa main bhi khaasaa hangaamaa khadaa hua
 During the winter session of Parliament last year, External Affairs Minister SM Krishna said that the government is serious about the Gita controversy
 roosi sarkaar ke saamne bhi yah masalaa uthaaya gaya he
 On December 28 last year, the Lower Court of Tomsk dismissed a petition opposing the ban on Geeta
 disambar main pradhanmantri manmohan singh ke rus daure ke dauraan bhi yah maamla uthaa
 On the other hand, 20 Russian scholars writing on India have suggested not to ban their government
 tippaniyan In Russia, it was alleged that in the Bhagavad 'geeta as it is' there is discrimination of limb ethnicity, nationality and language, hence the case in Tomask in Siberia
 yachika main gita ke is anuwaad ko kattarpanthi saamagree kii suchi main shaamil karke ise rakhane, chhapane or baantne par roak lagane kii maang kii gai
 There was a lot of uproar in the Lok Sabha on the controversy over Geeta in Russia
 pichley saal sansad ke sheetakaaleen satr ke dauraan videsh mantri es em krishna ne kaha ki gita vivaad ko lekar sarkaar gambhir he
 This issue has also been raised in front of the Russian government

 modi lahar ke baavjood shivasena ne apane ilaake main apane siyaasi varchasv ko puri tarah se barkaraar rakhaa tha
 In the Konkan region of Maharashtra, Palghar, Thane, Raigad, Mumbai, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg districts fall in more seats than BJP
 konkan rigen main kul 39 vidhansabha siten aati hai
 It is believed to be a strong stronghold from the beginning
 is baar ke chunaav main bijepi-shivasena gathbandhan ke tahat konkan ilaake kii 25 siton par shivasena maidan main he to 11 siton par bijepi chunavi taal thok rahi he
 The BJP is contesting fewer seats in the Konkan region than the Uddhav Thackeray-led Shiv Sena
 jabaki, congress-ensipi gathbandhan ke tahat konkan kshetra kii 15 siton par congress chunaav lard rahi he to 24 siton par ensipi ne pratyaashee utaare hai
 In this way, NCP has fielded more seats than Congress in Konkan region
 dilachasp baat yah he ki bijepi banaam congress to ensipi banaam shivesna ke bich zyaadaatar siton par muqabla he
 Refinery Ratnagiri becomes electoral issue An election issue remains in the Nanar Refinery Ratnagiri in the Konkan region
 ratnagiri jile ke nanar main prastaavit rifinary pariyojna kaa vipaksh ke virodh karne ke chalate shivasena or bijepi bich talkhi kaa vajah bhi rahi he
 The Shiv Sena says that the billion-rupee refinery project will have an adverse impact on the fragile ecology of Konkan
 yahi vajah he ki bijepi ko siyaasi mizaaj ko samajhate hue yah kehane ke liye majaboor hona padaa he ki nanar rifinary ratnagiri ko hataaya ja saktaa he
 The Konkan region is considered a strong stronghold of the Shiv sena-bjp
 vidhansabha chunaav ke pehle vipakshi dalon ke kai netaaon ke paala badalane ke kaaran bijepi or shivasena kii sthiti majubat hoti dikh rahi he
 All eight municipal corporations in the Konkan region hold Shiv sena-bjp alliance
 thane, ratnagiri or sindhudurg main shivasena kaa dabadabaa he
 At the same time, the BJP has also flagged success in Thane and Palghar since 2014
 rane ke jariye bijepi kii konkan par najarcongress or sharad pavaar ke netritv vaali ensipi kaa is kshetra main janaadhar kam hua he
 After the Lok Sabha elections, many sitting congress-ncp mlas in this area have switched to BJP or Shiv Sena
 in donon partiyon ne in baagiyon ko maidan main bhi utaara he
 The BJP has a complete eye on the Konkan region
 yahi vajah he ki shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare ke virodh ke baavjood bijepi ne narayan rane ko party main shaamil karaayaa or unke bete nitesh rane ko maidan main utaara he
 In such a situation, who is to conquer the fort of Konkan? hindi cinema kii saphaltam filmon main se ek 'pike' ke diarector rajkumaar hiraani kaa kahana he ki ve box offis par film kii kamai ko lekar zyada chintit nahin rahete hai
 He also said that the scale of a good film is not earned

 Many films earn well at the box office but people forget about it the very next day

 The film 'masaan' made in Neeraj Ghewan's direction has been appreciated internationally

 Hirani has been impressed with the film

 ' TV Actress Pratyusha Banerjee, with a new twist in the suicide case, is suspecting her boyfriend Rahul Raj Singh of being accused
 khud rahul ke vakil niraj gupta ne is cese se hatana behatar samajha
 He has had exclusive conversations over the phone with Aaj Tak
 is dauraan unhone cese se judi kai hairaan kar dene vaali baton se pardaa uthaaya
 Come, let us know what big shocking reasons Neeraj Gupta had to withdraw from this case: Rahul's parents' behavior, he wanted me to do all things according to him as he says
 ab aap bataaen ki marij agar doctor ke paas aayega to kya doctor marij ke mutabik chalegaa? wo chaahate the ki main unke hisaab se chaluun or apane tareeke se kaam naa karun
 He wanted me to stay with Rahul for 24 hours
 Rahul kemata-pitane also told me that as long as Rahul is in the hospital, i should sit with him in the hospital
 kya yah sambhav he ki main subah se raat tak apane client ke saath hospital main hi baitha rahun? main ek vakil hum
 i have many more cases
 is cese main meri jo jimedaari banati thi maine wo kiya
 i was also the one to present Rahul to the police
 rahul ne chipaaya pehali patni kaa sachrahul ke mata-pita or khud rahul ne mujhase unki pehali shaadi kii baat bhi chhipaai
 i came to know from the media that he was previously with a hair hostess and has a son
 to mere kahana yah he ki aap apane vakil se yah sab chijen kaise chipa sakate hai
 i would not like to say more about his first wife at the moment
 bas itnaa kahuunga ki vah rahul ko bahut pyaar karti thim
 i will share the remaining information about this with the media soon
 mediase baat karne se manaa kiyarahul ke mata-pita ne mujhe media se baat karne se bhi roka
 But when all the questions are being raised through the media on you, then your accountability is created, then how can you turn away from the media
 kahaan gayapratyushaka paisa?rahul ke pita kii yah baat bhi badi ajeeb thi ki wo pratyusha ko do-chaar hajaar rupee bheja karte the
 Now the question arises that whether a well-known actress was really fascinated by the thousand rupees
 aisa to he nahin ki unhone paisa nahin kamaaya
 The question arises as to who used their money
 pratyusha kii kharaab aarthik sthiti ke liye har wo shaks jimmedaar he jisane unke paison kaa istemaal kiya phir chaahe wo rahul ho yaa unke gharavaale
 There is no pressure on me
 We asked Neeraj Gupta that the industry and most people are considering Rahul as the accused for Pratyusha's death
 to kya is dabaav ke chalate aapane cese se baahar hona hi behatar samajha? unhone kaha, 'agar aisa hota to main pehle hi is cese ke liye nahin ladata
 When i caught this case, many people in the industry refused to do so
 meri industry main ek image he
 i do not want to kill anyone but i have tried to save only my client who is not guilty
 rahul ke cese main bhi main har wo cheez saamne laata jo sach tha lekin mujh se bahut si baaten chhipaai ja raheen thi or phir maine apane jameer kii aawaaj suni or is cese se baahar honekafaislakia
 Is Rahul Raj really tense or
 
 
 
 When Neeraj was asked, is Rahul Raj really unwell or is he resorting to illness just to avoid arrest? He said, 'we cannot justify the report of doctors
 haa, unke tanaav ke bare main yahi kahuunga ki tanaav do tarah kaa ho saktaa he yaa to vaaki pratyusha kii maut kaa sadma yaa phir giraftaar kaa dar
 By bringing the truth to the fore, Rahunganiraj also said that he will soon bring the truth related to this case to the people so that the police can help in the investigation of this case
 unhone kaha, 'main yah nahin chahta ki kisi begunaah ko sajaa ho lekin agar rahul aaropee hai to unhen sajaa milani chahie
 If they are not, they should be saved
 main apni ore se is cese ko sulajhane ke liye police kii madad karuunga

 advocate said that they do not know, but the descendants of the Jaipur royal family and former Princess Diya Singh claimed that Jay has introduced the Rajgrana God academic Shri Ram's son is a descendant of Kush and its documents Jaipur is near the royal family

 Mahendra Singh Mewar of the Mewar royalty also claimed that the Mewar royal family is a descendant of Lord Ram's son Love
 mewar ke purv rajkumaar lakshyaraj singh mewar ne daawa karte hue bataaya tha ki karnal james tod ne apni pustak 'enles and anticuities of rajasthan' main zikr kiya tha ki shriram kii rajdhani ayodhya thi or unke bete lav ne lav kot yani lahore basaaya tha
 Whereas Luv's descendants later migrated through Gujarat and settled in Mewar, where Sisodia kingdom was established

 Shriram was also a worshiper of Shiva and the Mewar family is also a worshiper of Lord Shiva
