 In this connection, he also wanted to meet Modi, but he did not get the time
 mangalvaar der raat narendra modi ke karyaalay se 16 pannon kaa jawaab jari kiya gaya
 In this, the Gujarat government has responded to the allegations made by Arvind Kejriwal
 gujarat sarkaar ne kaha he ki kejariwal bebuniyaad or tathyon se pare aarope laga rahe hai
 The Gujarat government has clarified on gas prices that bjp's opinion on this issue has been clear from the beginning
 yashavanth sinha kii adhyakshata vaali standig cameti ne april, 2014 se gas keemten badhaane ke faisle par dobaaraa vichaar karne ko kaha tha
 Gujarat Energy Minister Saurabh Patel had opposed raising gas prices
 bayaan main kaha gaya he ki darasal aise aarope lagaakar kejariwal adhik daamon par bahurashtriya companiyon se gas aayaat kii vakaalat kar rahe hai, isiilie un par america kaa agent hone kaa aarope lagaaya jaataa he
 Reliance holds only 10 per cent, while state-run ONGC owns 80 per cent
 is bayaan main arvind kejariwal par palatwaar bhi kiya gaya he
 Kejriwal has been asked to explain why his party did not demand an FIR in the agustawestland helicopter scam in which Sonia Gandhi is directly involved
 kya aisa kejariwal kii sonia or enesi se najdiki or gathbandhan ke chalate nahin kiya gaya? Kejriwal's allegations on Gujarat's agricultural growth rate have also been denied
 mukhyamantri karyaalay dwaara jari bayaan main kaha gaya he ki yojana ayog ke mutabik narendra modi kii aguwai main gujarat main pichley ek dashak main krishi vruddhi dar 11 fisadi rahi he
 Kejriwal misled by telling false figures

 According to the statement, when Modi became the Chief Minister, the drop out rate was 20 percent, now it has come down to two percent
 kejariwal yah aarope lagaate rahe hai ki narendra modi sarkaar ne adani udyog samooh ko phayda pahunchaaya
 On this, the statement said that all the industries in Gujarat under the leadership of Modi have flourished

 Adani has investments not only in Gujarat but also in other states
 adani samooh kaa gujarat main kul nivesh kaa sirf 35 fisadi he
 As far as land acquisition policy is concerned, Gujarat's land acquisition policy has also been praised by the Supreme Court
 kejariwal aarope lagaate rahe hai ki gujarat main 800 se zyada kisaanon ne aatmahatyaayein kii hai
 On this, it is said in the statement that it is interesting that Kejriwal is taking up this matter like Rahul Gandhi
 bayaan ke mutabik gujarat main kisaanon kii aatmahatya ke maamle nahin hai
 Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh are the two states with the highest number of farmer suicides
 kejariwal par palatwaar karte hue kaha gaya he ki behatar hoga ki kejariwal yah bataaen ki dilli main aam aadmi party kii sarkaar ne kya kiya? balaatkaar badhate rahe or naslbhed ke aadhaar par aparaadh hote rahe, yahaan tak ki unke mantri bhi naslbhed main shaamil rahe

 Kejriwal also accuses Modi of compromising on the issue of corruption
 khaastaur se modi sarkaar ke do mantriyon - purushottam solanki or babubhai bokhaaria ke maamalon kaa zikr kiya jaataa he
 On this, the statement issued by the Chief Minister's Office said that there is no charge sheet against Solanki, while the punishment against Babubhai Bokharia has been stayed from the High Court
 kuccha ke sikh kisaanon ke mudde par gujarat sarkaar kaa kahana he ki punjab or haryana se aae 454 sikh pariwaron ke paas ab bhi jameen he, jabaki kejariwal gaiyrkanoonee dhang se kheti kii jameen kharidne vaale real estate mafia kii madad kar rahe hai
 By becoming fake farmers around Gandhidham, Bhuj and Mundra, this mafia has purchased agricultural land
 15 se 20 hajaar karod rupee ke is gorakhdhandhe main farji kisaanon kaa saath dekar kejariwal bhi shaamil hai
 Kejriwal's allegations on issues such as electricity, unemployment, Narmada water given to factories instead of farmers, solar energy rates, health data, small and medium industries in Gujarat have also been answered in a sequential manner

 But SBI showed lethargy in it
 yahi nahin, jila prashasan ke aadesh dene ke baad bhi koi kaam nahin hua
 This is the reason why the District Collector has taken action
 vahiin yavatmal ke state bank of india par aarope he ki jile ke kisaanon ke bank khaaton main 571 karod rupye karj jamaa karne the lekin esbiai ne sirf 51 karod rupye die gaye
 In another such case, action has been taken against Axis Bank in Akola

 pienbi main hue 11 hajaar karod rupee ke mahaghotaale ne share market se lekar banking sector kii neend uda rakhi he
 At the same time, there is now a lot of politics on this scam
 bijepi or congress ek duusare par aarope laga rahe hai
 In the midst of this debate, questions are also being raised on the banking system that despite the guidelines of the Reserve Bank, how did PNB give such large loans easily? Not only this, PNB has already suffered a setback due to such scam, yet again how PNB got caught in the clutches of diamond traders
 darasal, 5 saal pehle hira kaarobaar se sambandh rakhane valeztin mehtake vinsom group ne bhi bhartiya bainkon ko kuch isi tarah kaa jhatka diya tha
 At that time, the famous Diamond House could not pay the dues of a dozen banks
 is ghotaale kaa sabase zyada asar us vakt bhi pienbi ko hua tha
 Over a dozen banks had loaned Rs 6,800 crore to Winsome on Standard Chartered Bank's Undertaking
 isamen pienbi ne sabase zyada expoger 1,800 karod die the
 According to banking sources, banks had also issued letters of credit to the company at that time
 yah letters esbelsi international bullian banks ko die gaye
 It was the same organization that supplied gold to the Winsome Group companies
 letters of credit ishu hone ke vakt yah samajha gaya tha ki yadi vinsom bullian bank ko bhugtan nahin kar paati he to bhartiya bank gold consinament ke liye pement karenge
 Winsome could not pay the money
 us par reepement kaa dabaav banataa gaya or aakhirkaar usne yah daawa kiya ki pashchim asia main clyants ko nuksaan hone kii vajah se vah reepement nahin kar paaegi, tab bhartiya bainkon ko jhatka laga tha
 Now again a similar argument has been given by PNB to the CBI in the Nirav Modi case
 us vakt bhi halaat isi tarah bane the
 The people of the Mehta family, promoters of the Winsome Group, have never visited India since the scandal
 inamen se kuch singapore main settle ho gaye hai to kuch dubai main
 Who is Jatin Mehta 
 
 
 Jatin Mehta is the Chief Promoter of Winsome Diamonds and Jewelery Limited
 mehta kaa sambandh desh ke bade kaarobaariyon main se ek adani parivaar se bhi he
 Jatin Mehta seems to be their partner in the relationship
 jatin mehta par 7 hajaar karod lekar faraar hone kaa aarope he or 2012 se unki koi khabar nahin he
 Please tell that Jatin Mehta took 7 thousand crore rupees as loan from 13 private and public sector banks during the UPA regime, while in return he did not offer any concrete asset in the form of exchange
 panama papers ke mutabik jatin mehta ne bainkon se karj lee gai raashi ko bahamas main nivesh kiya he

 He was often out of work
 isi dauraan uskiptnigumraah ho gai or ek yuvak ke saath uskaa prem prasang shuru ho gaya
 Her lover named Ashu used to come to her house in the absence of Baljeet
 balajit is baat se puri tarah anjaan tha
 On April 24, Baljit went to work on a daily basis, according to Catchapolis, who celebrated his wife with a lover
 raat main uske ghar aane kaa iraadaa nahin tha
 But when the work was over, he suddenly returned to his home at night
 jaise hi wo ghar main daakhil hua to uski ankhen fatty kii fatty rah gai
 His wife was celebrating with her lover Ashu in offensive condition

 Meanwhile, Ashu took advantage of the opportunity and escaped

 But in the mind of his wife Pooja, a plot to remove her husband from the path was born forever
 vah apane pati se chhutkaaraa paanaa chaahati thi
 The same night, Pooja carried out the first part of her plot
 usne pati ko behosh karne ke liye uske khaane main neend kii dher sari goliyaan mila di
 As a result, Baljit fell asleep deeply while eating
 iske baad puja ne apane aashikak ashu ko bula liya
 And told him about the whole plot
 kuch der baad ashu apane 3 saathiyon ko lekar puja ke paas pahunchaa
 After strangling her husband, all the people entered the room and together with Ashu and his friends, Pooja strangled her husband Baljeet with a shank
 jab unhen itaminan ho gaya ki balajit mar chukaa he
 So Pooja's lover Ashu fled with his friends
 ghatana ke baad puja ne ghar kaa darwaja band kiya or pati kilashke sirahaane baithkar tivi dekhne lagi
 After spending two days with her husband's corpse, Pooja sat comfortably watching TV and later slept comfortably on the bed
 agle din wo ghar se baahar nahin nikali
 In this way, Pooja spent the night of 24 and 25 April living in the house with her husband's corpse
 na wo ghar se baahar nikali or na hi usne kisi ko phone kiya
 Even he kept the door of the house closed continuously
 pati kii laash ke tukade kiehatya kii vaardaat ko do din biit chuke the

 Rabri Devi, the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) candidate from Saran, on Wednesday said that his brother Sadhu will not contest any independent election, while Sadhu, who announced his election to contest as an independent from Saran, on Wednesday said his sister (rabri) And once again targeted the brother-in-law (lalu)
 patna main patrakaron se charchaa karte hue rabari ne kaha ki sadhu se unka koi muqabla nahin he
 He said, if the saints go further in the field, then they will know the reality
 chhapra kii janata unhen sabak sikhayegi
 Asked about the obedience of the monk, she said that she would not go to persuade anyone
 idhar, argedy ke adhyaksh lalu prasad ke saale sadhu ne buudhvaar ko kaha, unhen bahan or jija ne paanch varsh se alag kar diya, hamako achhut maan rahe hai
 There is no family for me
 unhone spasht kaha ki main to kisi se kuch nahin puch rahaa
 He said that he is going to Saran and will contest the elections independently from the people there
 lalu ne mangalvaar ko kaha tha ki sadhu ke saaran se chunaav ladane se koi fark nahin padegaa
 a single RJD vote will not be cut by a sadhu contesting elections
 kaha jaataa he ki sadhu bhaajapa se tikat kii ummid lagaae baithe the, jiske liye unhone modi kaa gungan bhi kiya tha ir unka darwaja bhi khatkhataya tha
 The image of the monk was that of a domineering leader during the lalu-rabri regime in Bihar

 Despite battling back pain, artistic batsman VVS Laxman scored an unbeaten 73 against Australia on the last day of the first Test match to give India a memorable win in a very exciting match
 lakshmana ne australia dwaara die gaye 216 ran ke lakshya kaa peechha karte hue bharat kii pari ko lagbhag akele ke dam par hi sambhala kyonki duusare chor par anbhavi ballebaaj kharaab shot khelte or ampaire ke galat faislon ke kaaran ek-ek kar out ho rahe the
 Laxman, thanks to his innings, gave India a very memorable Test victory
 bharat kii duusari pari main doosraa sarvaadhik score sachin tendulkar kaa rahaa jinhone 38 ran banaaye
 At the same time, Ishant Sharma also scored an important 31 runs while batting at the lower order
 aaj mili jeet ke saath hi bharat ne ab shrinkhalaa main 1-0 kii badhat hasil kar lee he or usne border-gavaskar trophy ke itihaas ke saatven sabase bade lakshya kaa peechha karte hue shrinkhalaa ko bachaa liya he
 Now the second and last Test match between the two teams will be held in Bangalore from October 9
 donon hi pariyon main ranor kaa istemaal karne vaale lakshmana aaj subah jahir khan ke out hone ke baad tendulkar kaa saath dene aae jo kal raatri pahari ke rup main maidan par utre the
 Tendulkar and Laxman, understanding the delicate state of the match, moved the innings at a brisk pace
 chot se jujhane ke baavjood lakshmana ne shuru se hi khubasurat shaat lagaae
 Alam was that Tendulkar and Laxman had only 6
 1 over main 43 ran jodakar bharat ko jeet kii ore aage badhaaya
 Tendulkar hit five fours in his 64-ball innings with the victory on his shoulders
 unke cover drive or kalaayiyon dwaara lagaae gaye shaat unke iraadon ko saaf jaahir kar rahe the
 But the Australian bowlers kept the pressure on, bowling India out with Tendulkar just before the first drink break of the morning session
 apper cat lagane ke prayaas main bolinger kii gend par tendulkar chook gaye or mike hasi ne gali main shandaar kaich lapka
 Captain Dhoni came on the field to support Laxman after the master blaster was dismissed
 dhoni shuru se hi vipakshi gendbaajon kii gendon ko samajhane main naakaamayaab rahe or galatfahami kaa shikaar hokar ran out ho gaye
 Laxman's runner-up Raina and Dhoni showed lack of coordination between the runs and Dhoni had to run out and return to the pavilion
 dhoni ke baad maidan par utre harbhajan singh bhi zyada der austrailian gendbaajon kaa saamana nahin kar paae or bolinger kii baahar jaati hui gend par balla ada baithe or duusari slip par khadey riki ponting ne kaich pakadaney main koi galati nahin kii
 Hyderabad batsman Laxman today again proved why he is called India's pillar in Test cricket
 aaj kii shandaar pari se bamushkil do maheene pehle lakshmana ne srilanka ke khilaaf colombo main tisare test match main naabad 103 ran kii pari kii badaulat bharat ko jeet dilaai thi
 Laxman's bat has always spoken fiercely against the Australian team
 varsh 2001 main kolkata main hue test match ko koun bhul saktaa he jisamen is kalatmak ballebaaj kii 281 ran kii pari ne austrailia ko phaloan dene ke baavjood haar ke liye majaboor kar diya tha
 With the victory in the first Test, it is clear that India took an unbeatable lead in this two-match series
 bangalore main hone vaale duusare test main agar austrailian team jeet darj bhi kar leti he to bhi shrinkhalaa baraabar hi hogi or agar yah test dra rahata he yaa bharat jeetta he to shrinkhalaa dhoni and company ke naam ho jaaegi

 The news of the rape and then murder of Nirbhaya was published in detail in an English newspaper
 usee shaam yaa uske agle din wo khabar tivi par savaar hoti he or dekhte dekhte do teen dinon ke bheetar jaise jaise us cond kii ek ek kahani logon tak pahunchni shuru hoti he, log gharon se baahar aane lagate hai
 Initially, women organizations associated with the Left started, but later that movement was first in Delhi, then in the country
 jantar mantar se lekar raisina hills or rajpath par hazaron logon kaa hujum utar aayaa
 Many girls from Delhi who had never gone to any dharna went for the first time
 karnal se ek adhikari ne apni beti ko bheja kyonki unki beti is andolan main janaa chaahati thi
 No girl could stop herself
 lajpat nagar se ai wo ladkiyaan mujhe aaj bhi yaad hai
 She had printed posters with her money, wrote slogans against rape and female violence, she had come to the last to be free from this persecution
 unke maa baap bhi nahin roak sake the
 No one thought that the group of people would take possession of the Raisina Hills on which VIP cars used to drive till now or on the day of 26 January
 din ho yaa raat ho, balaatkaar ke kilaaf majboot kanoon, balaatkaar kii maansikta, police kii laaparvaahee in sab ko lekar awaz uth rahi thi
 The tongue of the government of that time started to falter
 justise verma ke netritv main cameti bani, giraftaar hui, sazaa hui sab hua
 This sun of April 12 is drowning in the Raisina Hills with whom it is hiding
 yahi raisina hills thi jis par hazaron logon ne pahunch kar soti sarkaar ko jagaa diya tha
 Roads are empty when Neeta's camera turns towards Rajpath
 ikkaa dukka kaaren chup chaap nazaren chupa kar utar rahi hai
 Have people made any calculation of religion in the case of Nirbhaya and Kathua? kya log ab apane hi us andolan se bhaagane lage hai ki kahin unhen bacchee ke liye baahar na nikalnaa pade yaa phir unhen balaatkaar kii ghatnaon se fark padana band ho gaya he
 Six years later, stones are running on these streets of Delhi, vehicles are seen on this road, but these places are empty of people who have left for Nirbhaya
 kya hamaara desh itnaa badal gaya he ki uske liye kathua kii peedita beti bhi nahin rahi
 Jantar Mantar is no longer for the people, so members of cpm's women's organization Adwa demonstrated here on Parliament Street
 par sawaal he ki is pradarshan ke liye adva ke hi log kyon aae, kya baaki dalon ke bheetar mahila sanghathanon main mritak bacchee ko lekar koi charchaa nahin he
 Shouldn't those women's organizations have been here
 nirbhaya ke vakt bhi yahi sanghathan tha or kavita krishnan thi isa kii, in logon kaa march hua tha magar baad main dilli ke logon kaa andolan ban gaya tha
 BJP leaders also used to come in this, leaders of other parties also used to come
 aaj sab gharon main baithe hai
 It was not that there was no rush in the case of Kathua
 15 farvari ko ek raily hui thi jisamen log tirangaa lekar nikle the
 This tricolor was once in the hands of those seeking to punish Nirbhaya's accused, but you can see that there is a crowd carrying the tricolor to save the accused policeman
 15 farvari kaa video he, jisamen log aaropee or police adhikari khajuriya ko bachaane ke liye naare laga rahe hai
 People have the tricolor in their hands
 yahi tirangaa kabhi nirbhaya ke aropiyon ko sazaa dene kii maang karne waalon ke haath main tha, magar yahaan tirangaa unke haath main he jo aaropee ko sazaa nahin balki bachaana chaahate hai
 On 10 January, Kathua's child is abducted and a few days later the Hindu Ekta Manch is formed
 di vir main 17 farvari ko mudasir ahamed kii ek report chhapi thi jisamen hindu ekta manch ke pramukh vijay sharma ne kaha tha ki police utpeedan se bachaane ke liye hindu ekta manch kaa gathan kiya gaya he
 According to the Wire's story, bjp's website shows that Vijay Sharma is the party's state secretary
 to kya bijepi ke netaa ne is cese ke aropiyon ko bachaane ke liye hindu ekta manch banaaya? vijay sharma hiranagar vidhansabha ke hindu ekta manch kaa pramukh bhi he
 Both BJP ministers are also involved in this rally
 van evam paryaavaran mantri laal singh choudhary or udyog va vaanijya mantri chander prakaash bhi shaamil hai
 The Hindu Ekta Manch had said at the time that their agitation would go on till the accused are released
 chand prakaash ganga ne zarur kaha ki bacchee ko insaaf milanaa chahie, insaaniyat kaa katl hua he
 But the way they are questioning the investigation, you can guess that they also want to please the crowd that i will get a class of officers
 bheed tali bajaati he
 They question the age of the accused
 kya chaar aropiyon kii umr alag alag nahin hoti he jo ye baat chand prakaash ji ko galat lag rahi he
 Our colleague Nita Sharma has told that Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti has met Home Minister Rajnath Singh in Delhi
 mahabuuba ne in do mantriyon ke kilaaf shikaayat kii he
 According to Neeta, the Chief Minister said that BJP leaders are creating problems for the Jammu and Kashmir government
 nita ke mutabik grahamantri ne kaha ki is pradarshan main shaamil hue log bijepi se nahin hai

 They are telling the government of their own party to be useless
 kathua main aath saal kii bacchee kii hatya or balaatkaar ke aropiyon kaa kya isliye saath diya ja rahaa he ve hindu hai
 BJP mps are talking about killing the accused in Rohtas because he is Muslim
 ham kahaan aa gaye hai
 Today in social media, IT cell is active about Rohtas incident
 wo usee tarah puch rahaa he ki kathua kii bacchee kii baat karte ho, rohtas kii bacchee kii baat kyon karte ho
 The mentality of IT cell makes a person alive

 Tell the Prime Minister whether MP Chedi Paswan is right or the matter of MLA Lal Singh, who demanded a CBI inquiry
 jantar mantar se lekar raisina hills or rajpath par hazaron logon kaa hujum utar aayaa
 Many girls from Delhi who had never gone to any dharna went for the first time
 karnal se ek adhikari ne apni beti ko bheja kyonki unki beti is andolan main janaa chaahati thi
 No girl could stop herself
 lajpat nagar se ai wo ladkiyaan mujhe aaj bhi yaad hai
 She had printed posters with her money, wrote slogans against rape and female violence, she had come to the last to be free from this persecution
 unke maa baap bhi nahin roak sake the
 No one thought that the group of people would take possession of the Raisina Hills on which VIP cars used to drive till now or on the day of 26 January
 din ho yaa raat ho, balaatkaar ke kilaaf majboot kanoon, balaatkaar kii maansikta, police kii laaparvaahee in sab ko lekar awaz uth rahi thi
 The tongue of the government of that time started to falter
 justise verma ke netritv main cameti bani, giraftaar hui, sazaa hui sab hua
 This sun of April 12 is drowning in the Raisina Hills with whom it is hiding
 yahi raisina hills thi jis par hazaron logon ne pahunch kar soti sarkaar ko jagaa diya tha
 Roads are empty when Neeta's camera turns towards Rajpath
 ikkaa dukka kaaren chup chaap nazaren chupa kar utar rahi hai
 Have people made any calculation of religion in the case of Nirbhaya and Kathua? kya log ab apane hi us andolan se bhaagane lage hai ki kahin unhen bacchee ke liye baahar na nikalnaa pade yaa phir unhen balaatkaar kii ghatnaon se fark padana band ho gaya he
 Six years later, stones are running on these streets of Delhi, vehicles are seen on this road, but these places are empty of people who have left for Nirbhaya
 kya hamaara desh itnaa badal gaya he ki uske liye kathua kii peedita beti bhi nahin rahi
 Jantar Mantar is no longer for the people, so members of cpm's women's organization Adwa demonstrated here on Parliament Street
 par sawaal he ki is pradarshan ke liye adva ke hi log kyon aae, kya baaki dalon ke bheetar mahila sanghathanon main mritak bacchee ko lekar koi charchaa nahin he
 Shouldn't those women's organizations have been here
 nirbhaya ke vakt bhi yahi sanghathan tha or kavita krishnan thi isa kii, in logon kaa march hua tha magar baad main dilli ke logon kaa andolan ban gaya tha
 BJP leaders also used to come in this, leaders of other parties also used to come
 aaj sab gharon main baithe hai
 It was not that there was no rush in the case of Kathua
 15 farvari ko ek raily hui thi jisamen log tirangaa lekar nikle the
 This tricolor was once in the hands of those seeking to punish Nirbhaya's accused, but you can see that there is a crowd carrying the tricolor to save the accused policeman
 15 farvari kaa video he, jisamen log aaropee or police adhikari khajuriya ko bachaane ke liye naare laga rahe hai
 People have the tricolor in their hands
 yahi tirangaa kabhi nirbhaya ke aropiyon ko sazaa dene kii maang karne waalon ke haath main tha, magar yahaan tirangaa unke haath main he jo aaropee ko sazaa nahin balki bachaana chaahate hai
 On 10 January, Kathua's child is abducted and a few days later the Hindu Ekta Manch is formed
 di vir main 17 farvari ko mudasir ahamed kii ek report chhapi thi jisamen hindu ekta manch ke pramukh vijay sharma ne kaha tha ki police utpeedan se bachaane ke liye hindu ekta manch kaa gathan kiya gaya he
 According to the Wire's story, bjp's website shows that Vijay Sharma is the party's state secretary
 to kya bijepi ke netaa ne is cese ke aropiyon ko bachaane ke liye hindu ekta manch banaaya? vijay sharma hiranagar vidhansabha ke hindu ekta manch kaa pramukh bhi he
 Both BJP ministers are also involved in this rally
 van evam paryaavaran mantri laal singh choudhary or udyog va vaanijya mantri chander prakaash bhi shaamil hai
 The Hindu Ekta Manch had said at the time that their agitation would go on till the accused are released
 chand prakaash ganga ne zarur kaha ki bacchee ko insaaf milanaa chahie, insaaniyat kaa katl hua he
 But the way they are questioning the investigation, you can guess that they also want to please the crowd that i will get a class of officers
 bheed tali bajaati he
 They question the age of the accused
 kya chaar aropiyon kii umr alag alag nahin hoti he jo ye baat chand prakaash ji ko galat lag rahi he

 a few cars are disguised as silent chaps
 kya logon ne nirbhaya or kathua ke maamle main mazahab kaa koi hisaab kiya he
 Are people now starting to run away from their own movement that they do not have to come out for the girl child or have they stopped making a difference with the incidents of rape
 chah saal baad dilli kii in sadakon par pathar chal rahe hai, is sadak par gaadiyaan dikh rahi hai, magar nirbhaya ke liye nikle logon se ye jagah khaali hai
 Has our country changed so much that even the daughter of Kathua's victim is no more
 jantar mantar to ab logon ke liye nahin rahaa isliye sansad maarg par sipiem kii mahila sanghathan adva ke sadasyon ne yahaan pradarshan kiya
 But the question is why the people of Adva came for this demonstration, is there no discussion about the deceased girl in women's organizations within the other parties
 kya un mahila sanghathanon ko yahaan nahin hona chahie tha
 It was the same organization at the time of Nirbhaya and Kavita Krishnan was Aisa, these people were marched but later the Delhi people became a movement
 isamen bijepi ke netaa bhi aate the, duusare dalon ke netaa bhi aate the
 Today everyone is sitting in homes
 aisa nahin tha ki kathua ke maamle main bheed nahin ai
 On 15 February, there was a rally in which people came out with the tricolor
 yahi tirangaa kabhi nirbhaya ke aropiyon ko sazaa dene kii maang karne waalon ke haath main tha, magar aap dekh sakate hai ki yahaan aaropee pulicekarmi ko bachaane ke liye tirangaa lekar bheed ai hui he
 There is a video of February 15, in which people are shouting slogans to save the accused and police officers Khajuria
 logon ke haath main tirangaa he
 This tricolor was once in the hands of those seeking to punish the accused of Nirbhaya, but here the tricolor is in their hands, who want to save the accused rather than punish them
 10 janvari ko kathua kii bacchee agava kii jaati he or uske kuch din baad hindu ekta manch kaa gathan hota he
 On February 17, a report by Mudasir Ahmed was published in The Wire in which Vijay Sharma, chief of Hindu Ekta Manch, said that Hindu Ekta Manch has been formed to protect against police harassment
 vir kii story ke hisaab se bijepi kii website se pataa chalata he ki vijay sharma party kaa rajya sachiv he
 So did the BJP leader create a Hindu unity platform to save the accused in this case? Vijay Sharma is also the head of Hindu Ekta Manch of Hiranagar Legislative Assembly
 isi raily main bijepi ke donon mantri bhi shaamil hai
 Forest and Environment Minister Lal Singh Chaudhary and Industry and Commerce Minister Chander Prakash are also included
 hindu ekta manch ne us vakt kaha tha ki jab tak aaropee chode nahin jaaenge unka andolan chalata rahegaa
 Chand Prakash Ganga definitely said that the girl child should get justice, humanity has been killed
 lekin jis tarah se ve jaanch par sawaal uthaa rahe hai usase aap andaaza laga sakate hai ki ve us bheed ko bhi khush karnaa chaah rahe hai ki afasaron kii class lagavaayuungaa
 The crowd claps
 ve aropiyon kii umr ke aadhaar par sawaal karte hai
 Is the age of the four accused not different, which Chand Prakash ji is finding wrong
 hamaari sahyogi nita sharma ne bataaya he ki mukhyamantri mahabuuba mufti dilli main grahamantri rajnath singh se mili hai
 Mehbooba has complained against these two ministers
 nita ke anusaar mukhyamantri ne kaha ki bijepi ke netaa jammu kashmir sarkaar ke liye pareshaani khadi kar rahe hai
 According to Neeta, the Home Minister said that the people who participated in this demonstration are not from the BJP
 jabaki tamaam report yah kah rahi he ki hindu ekta manch kii raily main bijepi ke do mantri shaamil hue the
 The Wire's report on Vijay Sharma also states that he is the state secretary of the BJP and is also the head of the Hiranagar Hindu Ekta Manch
 piemo ke rajyamantri jitendra singh kaa bayaan 22 farvari ke tribune main chapa tha jise baad scrol daat in ne bhi apane yahaan chapa tha
 In the PMO, Minister of State Jitendra Singh had said that if people do not have faith in the investigation of the police and the crime branch, then this case should be given to the CBI
 mujhe nahin lagata ki isamen koi samasya he
 If the state government proposes it, we will definitely take action on it
 ' The mid-march 12, 2018 news that BJP national vice-president Avinash Rai Khanna also supported the CBI investigation
 aapane 11 april ke prime time main hamaare sahyogi zafar iqbaal kii report main bijepi pravaktaa sunil sethi bhi police jaanch par sawaal uthaa rahe hai
 The question should be whether Hindu Ekta Manch is fighting for the justice of the girl child or to save the accused officials
 bijepi kaise kah sakati he ki uske netaa hindu ekta manch ke saath nahin hai
 While its ministers have been involved in Hindu Ekta Manch rally
 uski maang kaa samarthan karte rahe hai
 If the BJP had so much faith in the CBI investigation, why did it not become serious? sibiai jaanch ke aadesh kyon nahin hue
 Mehbooba Mufti is adamant that her own police will investigate
 unhone twit kiya he ki 'gair zimmedaar bayaan se kanoon kaa kaam prabhavit nahin hoga
 All procedures are being followed
 kaaphi tezi se jaanch ho rahi he
 There will be justice
 ' The crack within the system is also visible due to this incident
 kya aropiyon ke pakshdhar ko police par isliye bharosa nahin tha ki usamen koi musalmaan nahin tha
 It is shameful if this is a measure of faith
 express main mujamil jaleel kii khabar aapako pareshaan kerani chahie
 Two Sikh officers will be included in the investigation team to stop Hindu Muslims in the Jammu and Kashmir Police
 police saamne se nahin kah rahi he ki sikh adhikariyon ko isliye rakhaa ja rahaa he taaki aropiyon ke pakshdhar ko vishwaas ho sake
 The investigation of this case was being done under the supervision of the Jammu and Kashmir High Court 
 ramesh jallaa jo ki khud kashmiri pandit hai or kaabil afasar nahin hote to inspector se esaspi ke pad tak nahin pahunchate
 The SIT was conducting an investigation under his supervision, which was led by another capable officer, Naveed Pirzada
 is team ko 90 dinon main chargeshit taiyaar kerani thi magar 10 din pehle hi taiyaar kar lee
 Questions are also being raised about this
 kya kanoon main likhaa he ki 90wein din hi report taiyaar hogi, 90 din to samay seemaa he
 Jalla, who hails from Sringar, joined as an Inspector of Police in 1984
 unhone chargeshit daayar karne ke baad asia times ke reporter maajid hydari se kaha he ki do maheene ke baad ab main chaiyn kii neend so paaya hum
 In August 2016, Ramesh Jalla was awarded sher-e-kashmir Police Medal for outstanding work
 ramesh jalla par aatankwaadi hamalaa bhi hua he or ve kai maheene tak aspataal main rahe hai
 If the police team has made the police officers accused, then what is the problem of Hindu Ekta Manch
 bijepi ke netaaon ko kyon shaq he
 Even if in doubt, what is the function of the tricolor in it
 agar kal koi muslim sanghathan yah maang karne lage ki bacchee kii maut kii jaanch ke liye hindu adhikariyon par bharosa nahin he, tab is rajya vyavastha kii kya saakh rah jaaegi, kya ham yahaan tak aa pahunche hai ki har samudaay ko apni ghatana kii jaanch ke liye apane samudaay kaa adhikari chahie hoga
 Our leaders are quick to speak

 The medical superintendent who confirmed the rape was abruptly transferred
 farvari main bacchee ke parivaar ne hoicourt main nishpaksh jaanch kii guhaar lagaai thi
 At each hearing, the Crime Branch has submitted a status report
 hoicourt ne aropiyon ko arest karne ke aadesh diye
 The lawyers and political parties were resisting arrest even after court supervision
 kya isliye ve jai shri ram kaa naaraa laga sakate the, haath main tirangaa lekar aa sakate hai
 The court was so crowded that it took six hours for the police to hand over the charge sheet to the magistrate
 ye he nayaa india
 Which has a crowd that is on standby everywhere like the Rapid Action Force
 yah bheed pehle tirangaa lekar aati he, baar baar tirange ke sammaan kaa sawaal uthaati he, is tirange ko pehle uniwarsity main tonga gaya taaki vahaan rashtrawaad faile magar jaldi hi bheed ne us tirange ko apana naqaab bana liya
 So that you do not see the face of the crowd due to respect for the tricolor
 news channelon or whatsap uniwarsity ke zarie hindu muslim dibet se faili nafrat is bheed main bhari hoti he
 Now this crowd is everywhere
 isamen shaamil har kisi kaa cheharaa tirange se dhanka he
 You see the tricolor, and do we also respect that tricolor wholeheartedly

 Where is he willing to go kahaan aag lagane ke taiyaar he
 Looking at you from the face, move towards the face, the intention of this mob will be seen and you will regret that your beloved tricolor is used to save the accused of rape

 She was raped even after she died

 If not included, you will not be able to sleep overnight
 hamaare sahyogi zafer iqbaal un jagahon par gaye hai jahaan bacchee ke aakiri kshanon ke aansu or koon ke nishaan hai
 There are no marks, but there is a story
 videsh rajya mantri wike singh ne kaha he ki hamane bacchee ke bharose ko todaa he
 Amidst the silence of the Prime Minister, this statement of VK Singh is true but it is ointment
 kam se kam eemaandaaree to he
 Why do leaders take so long to make this statement? isi 21 farvari ko australia main ek bacchee ke saath balaatkaar kii ghatana hui
 The government there apologized
 police pramukh ne maafee maangi
 We are looking at caste and religion
 congress netaa manish tiwari pradhanmantri modi ke puraane twit ko ri twit kiya he
 In this tweet dated 30 April 2014, Narendra Modi has said, 'don't forget Nirbhaya
 berozegaar yuvaaon ko mat bhoolanaa
 Do not forget the farmers who are committing suicide
 mat bhoolanaa kis tarah hamaare javaanon ke sar kaate gaye
 ' kya hindu muslim kii raajnneeti samaaj or system ko yahaan tak le aegi
 If the BJP was already conscious then what was going on in Jammu since January
 ram madhav ne fasebuk par likhaa he ki ek april ko jammu kashmir rajya kii bijepi kaaryakarini main prastaav paas hua tha ki naaballig ke jaghanya balaatkaar kii ninda kii jaati he
 Such crimes are inhumane
 inke sampradayik banane ke kisi bhi prayaas kii ninda karne kii jarurat he
 The perpetrators of the crime should be punished according to the law and should not harass the innocent
 kya ram madhav ne laal singh or chand prakaash ganga se poocha tha ki ve hindu ekta manch kii sabha main jaanch main phir kyon sawaal uthaa rahe the
 Whether the leader of Hindu Ekta Manch belongs to his party or not
 aaropee ko bachaane ke liye hindu ekta manch ko aage laane kii kya zarurat thi
 Who brought the Hindu unity platform forward, only Mehbooba Mufti can tell it better
 umr abdulla ne kaha he ki bijepi ke do mantriyon ke ishaare par bheed bekaabu hui
 When will action be taken against them? agar mahabuuba in do mantriyon kii shikaayat grahamantri se karne ain thim to ve karrwai kab karengi
 Rahul Gandhi has tweeted, 'how can anyone defend the guilty of such a crime
 yah maanavtaa ke khilaaf aparaadh he
 What have we become? If we allow politics to interfere in unimaginable cruelty with an innocent girl? 'comments aap apane bachche se zarur puuchhie ki kahin wo is nafrat ke saath to nahin he
 Don't be late varna wo bhi kisi din is bheed main shaamil hokar aparaadh kar baithegaa
 a case of rape of a 6-year-old girl has been reported in Rohtas, Bihar
 jo aaropee giraftaar hua he wo muslim he
 In Kathua, where BJP leaders did not say that the accused should be killed, hanged, what language are BJP mps using in Rohtas, you hear
 wo to apni hi party kii sarkaar ko nikamma bataa rahe hai
 Why are the accused of murder and rape of an eight-year-old girl in Kathua being supported? rohtas main aaropee ko baandh kar maarane kii baat bijepi saansad isliye kar rahe hai ki wo muslim he
 Where have we come aaj soshal media main iti cell rohtas kii ghatana ko lekar sakriy he
 He is asking in the same way, why do you talk about the child of Kathua, why do you talk about the girl of Rohtas
 iti cell kii maansikta insaan ko darinda bana detii he
 Makes the same murder justified and illegitimate according to religion
 pradhanmantri bataaen ki saansad chhedi paswan kii baat sahi he yaa sibiai jaanch kii maang karne vaale vidhayak laal singh kii baat sahi he
 Jantar Mantar is no longer for the people, so members of cpm's women's organization Adwa demonstrated here on Parliament Street
 par sawaal he ki is pradarshan ke liye adva ke hi log kyon aae, kya baaki dalon ke bheetar mahila sanghathanon main mritak bacchee ko lekar koi charchaa nahin he
 Shouldn't those women's organizations have been here
 nirbhaya ke vakt bhi yahi sanghathan tha or kavita krishnan thi isa kii, in logon kaa march hua tha magar baad main dilli ke logon kaa andolan ban gaya tha
 BJP leaders also used to come in this, leaders of other parties also used to come
 aaj sab gharon main baithe hai
 It was not that there was no rush in the case of Kathua
 15 farvari ko ek raily hui thi jisamen log tirangaa lekar nikle the
 This tricolor was once in the hands of those seeking to punish Nirbhaya's accused, but you can see that there is a crowd carrying the tricolor to save the accused policeman
 15 farvari kaa video he, jisamen log aaropee or police adhikari khajuriya ko bachaane ke liye naare laga rahe hai
 People have the tricolor in their hands
 yahi tirangaa kabhi nirbhaya ke aropiyon ko sazaa dene kii maang karne waalon ke haath main tha, magar yahaan tirangaa unke haath main he jo aaropee ko sazaa nahin balki bachaana chaahate hai
 On 10 January, Kathua's child is abducted and a few days later the Hindu Ekta Manch is formed
 di vir main 17 farvari ko mudasir ahamed kii ek report chhapi thi jisamen hindu ekta manch ke pramukh vijay sharma ne kaha tha ki police utpeedan se bachaane ke liye hindu ekta manch kaa gathan kiya gaya he
 According to the Wire's story, bjp's website shows that Vijay Sharma is the party's state secretary
 to kya bijepi ke netaa ne is cese ke aropiyon ko bachaane ke liye hindu ekta manch banaaya? vijay sharma hiranagar vidhansabha ke hindu ekta manch kaa pramukh bhi he
 Both BJP ministers are also involved in this rally
 van evam paryaavaran mantri laal singh choudhary or udyog va vaanijya mantri chander prakaash bhi shaamil hai
 The Hindu Ekta Manch had said at the time that their agitation would go on till the accused are released
 chand prakaash ganga ne zarur kaha ki bacchee ko insaaf milanaa chahie, insaaniyat kaa katl hua he
 But the way they are questioning the investigation, you can guess that they also want to please the crowd that i will get a class of officers
 bheed tali bajaati he
 They question the age of the accused
 kya chaar aropiyon kii umr alag alag nahin hoti he jo ye baat chand prakaash ji ko galat lag rahi he
 Our colleague Nita Sharma has told that Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti has met Home Minister Rajnath Singh in Delhi
 mahabuuba ne in do mantriyon ke kilaaf shikaayat kii he
 According to Neeta, the Chief Minister said that BJP leaders are creating problems for the Jammu and Kashmir government
 nita ke mutabik grahamantri ne kaha ki is pradarshan main shaamil hue log bijepi se nahin hai
 While all the reports are saying that two BJP ministers attended the rally of Hindu Ekta Manch
 vijay sharma ke bare main bhi di vir kii report bataati he ki vah bijepi kaa rajya sachiv he or hiranagar hindu ekta manch kaa pramukh bhi he
 The statement of PMO Minister of State Jitendra Singh was published in the Tribune of 22 February, which was later published by Scroll
in
 piemo main rajya mantri jitend singh ne kaha tha ki agar logon kaa bharosa police or krime branch kii jaanch main nahin he to yah cese sibiai ko de dena chahie
 i don't think there is a problem
 agar rajya sarkaar iskaa prastaav karti he to ham zarur is par karrwai karenge
 ' 12 march 2018 ke mid kii khabar he ki bijepi ke rashtriya upaadhyaksh avinaash raay khanna ne bhi sibiai jaanch kaa samarthan kiya tha
 In the report of our colleague Zafar Iqbal in the prime time of April 11, BJP spokesperson Sunil Sethi is also questioning the police investigation
 sawaal yah hona chahie ki hindu ekta manch bacchee ke insaaf ke liye lard rahaa he yaa aaropee adhikariyon ko bachaane ke liye
 How can BJP say that its leaders are not with the Hindu Ekta Manch
 jabaki uske mantri hindu ekta manch kii raily main shaamil rahe hai
 Has been supportive of his demand
 agar bijepi kii sibiai jaanch par itnaa hi bharosa tha wo gambhir kyon nahin hui
 Why did the CBI inquiry not be ordered? mahabuuba mufti is baat par adi hai ki jaanch unki hi police karegi
 He tweeted that 'lawless work will not be affected by the irresponsible statement
 sari prakriyaaon kaa paalan kiya ja rahaa he
 Investigating fairly quickly
 insaaf hoga
 ' is ghatana se system ke bheetar ai daraar bhi dikh rahi he
 Did the accused of the accused not trust the police because there were no Muslims in it
 agar vishwaas kaa yah paimaana he to sharmnaak he
 The news of Mujamil Jalil in the Express should bother you
 jammu kashmir police main hindu muslim rokane ke liye do sikh adhikariyon ko jaanch dal main shaamil kiya jayega
 The police is not saying from the front that Sikh officers are being kept so that the accused of the accused can be trusted
 is cese kii jaanch jammu kashmir hoicourt kii nigaraanee main ho rahi thi
 Ramesh Jalla, who is a Kashmiri Pandit himself and is not a competent officer, would not have reached the rank of Inspector from SSP
 unki nigaraanee main esaiti jaanch kar rahi thi jiskaa netritv ek or kaabil afasar navid peerzada kar rahe the
 This team had to prepare the charge sheet in 90 days but got ready 10 days in advance
 ise lekar bhi sawaal uth rahe hai
 Is it written in the law that the report will be ready on the 90th day, 90 days is the time limit
 shranigar ke rahane vaale jalla ne 1984 main bataur police inspector jwine kiya tha
 After filing the charge sheet, he has told Asia Times reporter Majid Hydari that after two months, i am able to sleep peacefully now
 agast 2016 main ramesh jalla ko badhiya kaam ke liye sher-e-kashmir police medal diya gaya tha
 There has also been a terrorist attack on Ramesh Jalla and he has been in the hospital for several months
 police kii team ne agar police ke afasaron ko aaropee banaaya he to hindu ekta manch ko kya dikkat he
 Why BJP leaders are suspicious
 agar shaq he bhi to isamen tirange kaa kya kaam he
 If tomorrow a Muslim organization starts demanding that there is no trust in the Hindu authorities to investigate the death of the girl child, then what will be the credibility of this polity, have we come here so that every community should investigate its incident You will need to possess your community
 hamaare netaaon ko bolne kii jaldi rahati he
 MP from Khandwa in Madhya Pradesh and BJP state president Nandkumar Singh Chauhan says that Pakistan is behind the innocent who was raped in Kashmir
 unhone hi bharat main foot daalane ke liye kiya tha
 These statements have only one aim to make the story a Hindu Muslim
 phir netaa uske hisaab se ek bacchee kii laash par apni roti senk len
 Our colleague Nazir Masudi has written a report on ndtv
com
 nazir is cese ko 17 janvari ke follow kar rahe hai jab bacchee kii laash mili thi
 Nazir has written that the Hiranagar police station initially destroyed many important evidences
 jisamen bacchee ke khun se sane kapade the jise forencik lab main bheja janaa tha
 The district hospital took two months to submit the post mortem report
 jis medical supretendent ne balaatkaar kii pushti kii thi, uskaa achaanak se tabadalaa kar diya gaya
 In February, the girl's family had approached the High Court for an impartial inquiry
 prayek sunwaayee main krime branch ne states report jamaa kiya he
 The High Court ordered the arrest of the accused
 court kii nigaraanee ke baad bhi vakil or raajnneetik dal giraftaar kaa virodh kar rahe the
 Is that why they could have raised the slogan of Jai Shri Ram, can carry the tricolor in their hands
 court main itani bheed ho gai ki chah ghante lag gaye police ko magistrate ke haath main chargeshit saunpane main
 This is the new India
 jisamen ek bheed he jo rapid ection force kii tarah har jagah stand bai par he
 This mob first brings the tricolor, repeatedly raises the question of respecting the tricolor, this tricolor was first hung in the university so that nationalism spread there but soon the crowd made that tricolor as its mask
 taaki aap tirange ke prati sammaan ke kaaran bheed kaa cheharaa na dekh saken
 The hate spread through Hindu Muslim debate through news channels and whatsapp University is filled with this crowd
 ab ye bheed har taraf he
 The face of everyone involved is covered with a tricolor
 aapako tirangaa dikhataa he or aap kya ham bhi us tirange kaa dil se sammaan karte hai
 But you look at the feet of the crowd
 vah kahaan jane ko taiyaar he
 Where is the fire ready
 aap paanv se dekhte hue chehre kii taraf badhie, is bheed kaa iraadaa dikh jayega or aapako afsos hoga ki aapke pyaare tirange kaa istamaal bheed balaatkaar ke aropiyon ko bachaane ke liye karne lagi he
 The girl was abducted on 10 January
 uske saath mandir main baar baar balaatkaar hua
 Faint medicine was given
 marane ke baad bhi balaatkaar kiya gaya
 Its detail in the charge sheet is so terrible that you will not bother only when you are involved in this crowd
 agar shaamil nahin hai to raat bhar so nahin paaenge
 Our colleague Zafar Iqbal has gone to places where there are traces of tears and blood of the last moments of the girl child
 nishaan to nahin hai magar daastaan he
 Minister of State for External Affairs VK Singh has said that we have broken the trust of the girl child
 pradhanmantri kii chuppi ke bich ve ke singh kaa yah bayaan chaltau hi sahi magar maraham to he
 At least there is honesty
 yahi bayaan dene main netaaon ko itani der kyon lag jaati he
 On 21 February, a child rape incident occurred in Australia
 vahaan kii sarkaar ne maafee maangi
 The police chief apologized
 ham jati or dharm dekh rahe hai
 Congress leader Manish Tiwari has retweeted the old tweet of Prime Minister Modi
 30 april 2014 ke is twit main narendra modi ne kaha he ki 'nirbhaya ko mat bhoolanaa
 Don't forget unemployed youth
 aatmahatya kar rahe kisaanon ko mat bhoolanaa
 Do not forget how our soldiers were beheaded
 ' Will the politics of Hindu Muslim bring the society and the system up to here? agar bijepi pehle se sachet thi to janvari se jammu main chal kya rahaa tha
 Ram Madhav wrote on Facebook that on April 1, a resolution was passed in the BJP executive of Jammu and Kashmir state condemning the heinous rape of a minor
 aise aparaadh amanviya hai
 Any attempt to make them communal needs to be condemned
 aparaadh ko anjaam dene waalon ko kanoon ke mutabik sazaa deni chahie or nirdosh kaa utpeedan nahin karnaa chahie
 Did Ram Madhav ask Lal Singh and Chand Prakash Ganga why they were again raising questions during the inquiry in the meeting of Hindu Ekta Manch
 hindu ekta manch ke netaa unki party ke hai yaa nahin
 What was needed to bring the Hindu unity platform forward to save the accused
 koun laayaa hindu ekta manch ko aage, mahabuuba mufti hi behatar bataa sakati hai
 Omar Abdullah has said that the mob became uncontrolled at the behest of two BJP ministers
 unke khilaaf kab karrwai hogi
 If Mehbooba had come to complain to the two ministers, when will she take action
 rahul ganghi ne twit kiya he, 'aise gunaah ke doshi kaa bachaav koi kaise kar saktaa he
 It is a crime against humanity
 ham kya ho gaye hai? agar ham ek maasoom bacchee ke saath hui acolpaneey krurta main raajnneeti ko hastkshep karne dete hai?'tippaniyan You must ask your child if he is with this hatred
 der na ho jaae
 Otherwise, he will join the crowd someday and commit crime
 bihar ke rohtas main 6 saal kii ek bacchee se balaatkaar kaa maamla saamne aayaa he
 The accused who is arrested is a Muslim
 kathua main jahaan bijepi ke netaaon ne yah nahin kaha ki aaropee ko maar dena chahie, faansee par lataka dena chahie, rohtas main bijepi ke saansad kis bhashaa kaa istamaal kar rahe hai, aap suniye
 They are telling the government of their own party to be useless
 kathua main aath saal kii bacchee kii hatya or balaatkaar ke aropiyon kaa kya isliye saath diya ja rahaa he ve hindu hai
 BJP mps are talking about killing the accused in Rohtas because he is Muslim
 ham kahaan aa gaye hai
 Today in social media, IT cell is active about Rohtas incident
 wo usee tarah puch rahaa he ki kathua kii bacchee kii baat karte ho, rohtas kii bacchee kii baat kyon karte ho
 The mentality of IT cell makes a person alive
 ek hi qatl ko dharm ke hisaab se jaays or najayas bana detii he
 Tell the Prime Minister whether MP Chedi Paswan is right or the matter of MLA Lal Singh, who demanded a CBI inquiry
 aisa nahin tha ki kathua ke maamle main bheed nahin ai
 On 15 February, there was a rally in which people came out with the tricolor
 yahi tirangaa kabhi nirbhaya ke aropiyon ko sazaa dene kii maang karne waalon ke haath main tha, magar aap dekh sakate hai ki yahaan aaropee pulicekarmi ko bachaane ke liye tirangaa lekar bheed ai hui he
 There is a video of February 15, in which people are shouting slogans to save the accused and police officers Khajuria
 logon ke haath main tirangaa he
 This tricolor was once in the hands of those seeking to punish the accused of Nirbhaya, but here the tricolor is in their hands, who want to save the accused rather than punish them
 10 janvari ko kathua kii bacchee agava kii jaati he or uske kuch din baad hindu ekta manch kaa gathan hota he
 On February 17, a report by Mudasir Ahmed was published in The Wire in which Vijay Sharma, chief of Hindu Ekta Manch, said that Hindu Ekta Manch has been formed to protect against police harassment
 vir kii story ke hisaab se bijepi kii website se pataa chalata he ki vijay sharma party kaa rajya sachiv he
 So did the BJP leader create a Hindu unity platform to save the accused in this case? Vijay Sharma is also the head of Hindu Ekta Manch of Hiranagar Legislative Assembly
 isi raily main bijepi ke donon mantri bhi shaamil hai
 Forest and Environment Minister Lal Singh Chaudhary and Industry and Commerce Minister Chander Prakash are also included
 hindu ekta manch ne us vakt kaha tha ki jab tak aaropee chode nahin jaaenge unka andolan chalata rahegaa
 Chand Prakash Ganga definitely said that the girl child should get justice, humanity has been killed
 lekin jis tarah se ve jaanch par sawaal uthaa rahe hai usase aap andaaza laga sakate hai ki ve us bheed ko bhi khush karnaa chaah rahe hai ki afasaron kii class lagavaayuungaa
 The crowd claps

 Is the age of the four accused not different, which Chand Prakash ji is finding wrong
 hamaari sahyogi nita sharma ne bataaya he ki mukhyamantri mahabuuba mufti dilli main grahamantri rajnath singh se mili hai
 Mehbooba has complained against these two ministers
 nita ke anusaar mukhyamantri ne kaha ki bijepi ke netaa jammu kashmir sarkaar ke liye pareshaani khadi kar rahe hai
 According to Neeta, the Home Minister said that the people who participated in this demonstration are not from the BJP
 jabaki tamaam report yah kah rahi he ki hindu ekta manch kii raily main bijepi ke do mantri shaamil hue the
 The Wire's report on Vijay Sharma also states that he is the state secretary of the BJP and is also the head of the Hiranagar Hindu Ekta Manch
 piemo ke rajyamantri jitendra singh kaa bayaan 22 farvari ke tribune main chapa tha jise baad scrol daat in ne bhi apane yahaan chapa tha
 In the PMO, Minister of State Jitendra Singh had said that if people do not have faith in the investigation of the police and the crime branch, then this case should be given to the CBI
 mujhe nahin lagata ki isamen koi samasya he
 If the state government proposes it, we will definitely take action on it
 ' The mid-march 12, 2018 news that BJP national vice-president Avinash Rai Khanna also supported the CBI investigation
 aapane 11 april ke prime time main hamaare sahyogi zafar iqbaal kii report main bijepi pravaktaa sunil sethi bhi police jaanch par sawaal uthaa rahe hai
 The question should be whether Hindu Ekta Manch is fighting for the justice of the girl child or to save the accused officials
 bijepi kaise kah sakati he ki uske netaa hindu ekta manch ke saath nahin hai
 While its ministers have been involved in Hindu Ekta Manch rally
 uski maang kaa samarthan karte rahe hai
 If the BJP had so much faith in the CBI investigation, why did it not become serious? sibiai jaanch ke aadesh kyon nahin hue
 Mehbooba Mufti is adamant that her own police will investigate
 unhone twit kiya he ki 'gair zimmedaar bayaan se kanoon kaa kaam prabhavit nahin hoga
 All procedures are being followed
 kaaphi tezi se jaanch ho rahi he

 police saamne se nahin kah rahi he ki sikh adhikariyon ko isliye rakhaa ja rahaa he taaki aropiyon ke pakshdhar ko vishwaas ho sake
 The case was being investigated under the supervision of the Jammu and Kashmir High Court
 ramesh jallaa jo ki khud kashmiri pandit hai or kaabil afasar nahin hote to inspector se esaspi ke pad tak nahin pahunchate
 The SIT was conducting an investigation under his supervision, which was led by another capable officer, Naveed Pirzada
 is team ko 90 dinon main chargeshit taiyaar kerani thi magar 10 din pehle hi taiyaar kar lee
 Questions are also being raised about this
 kya kanoon main likhaa he ki 90wein din hi report taiyaar hogi, 90 din to samay seemaa he
 Jalla, who hails from Sringar, joined as an Inspector of Police in 1984
 unhone chargeshit daayar karne ke baad asia times ke reporter maajid hydari se kaha he ki do maheene ke baad ab main chaiyn kii neend so paaya hum
 In August 2016, Ramesh Jalla was awarded sher-e-kashmir Police Medal for outstanding work
 ramesh jalla par aatankwaadi hamalaa bhi hua he or ve kai maheene tak aspataal main rahe hai
 If the police team has made the police officers accused, then what is the problem of Hindu Ekta Manch
 bijepi ke netaaon ko kyon shaq he
 Even if in doubt, what is the function of the tricolor in it
 agar kal koi muslim sanghathan yah maang karne lage ki bacchee kii maut kii jaanch ke liye hindu adhikariyon par bharosa nahin he, tab is rajya vyavastha kii kya saakh rah jaaegi, kya ham yahaan tak aa pahunche hai ki har samudaay ko apni ghatana kii jaanch ke liye apane samudaay kaa adhikari chahie hoga
 Our leaders are quick to speak

 In which the girl had blood-soaked clothes which had to be sent to a forensic lab

 The court was so crowded that it took six hours for the police to hand over the charge sheet to the magistrate

 Our colleague Nazir Masudi has written a report on ndtv
com
 nazir is cese ko 17 janvari ke follow kar rahe hai jab bacchee kii laash mili thi
 Nazir has written that the Hiranagar police station initially destroyed many important evidences
 jisamen bacchee ke khun se sane kapade the jise forencik lab main bheja janaa tha
 The district hospital took two months to submit the post mortem report
 jis medical supretendent ne balaatkaar kii pushti kii thi, uskaa achaanak se tabadalaa kar diya gaya
 In February, the girl's family had approached the High Court for an impartial inquiry
 prayek sunwaayee main krime branch ne states report jamaa kiya he
 The High Court ordered the arrest of the accused
 court kii nigaraanee ke baad bhi vakil or raajnneetik dal giraftaar kaa virodh kar rahe the
 Is that why they could have raised the slogan of Jai Shri Ram, can carry the tricolor in their hands
 court main itani bheed ho gai ki chah ghante lag gaye police ko magistrate ke haath main chargeshit saunpane main
 This is the new India
 jisamen ek bheed he jo rapid ection force kii tarah har jagah stand bai par he
 This mob first brings the tricolor, repeatedly raises the question of respecting the tricolor, this tricolor was first hung in the university so that nationalism spread there but soon the crowd made that tricolor as its mask
 taaki aap tirange ke prati sammaan ke kaaran bheed kaa cheharaa na dekh saken
 The hate spread through Hindu Muslim debate through news channels and whatsapp University is filled with this crowd
 ab ye bheed har taraf he
 The face of everyone involved is covered with a tricolor
 aapako tirangaa dikhataa he or aap kya ham bhi us tirange kaa dil se sammaan karte hai
 But you look at the feet of the crowd
 vah kahaan jane ko taiyaar he
 Where is the fire ready
 aap paanv se dekhte hue chehre kii taraf badhie, is bheed kaa iraadaa dikh jayega or aapako afsos hoga ki aapke pyaare tirange kaa istamaal bheed balaatkaar ke aropiyon ko bachaane ke liye karne lagi he
 The girl was abducted on 10 January
 uske saath mandir main baar baar balaatkaar hua
 Faint medicine was given
 marane ke baad bhi balaatkaar kiya gaya
 Its detail in the charge sheet is so terrible that you will not bother only when you are involved in this crowd
 agar shaamil nahin hai to raat bhar so nahin paaenge
 Our colleague Zafar Iqbal has gone to places where there are traces of tears and blood of the last moments of the girl child

 30 april 2014 ke is twit main narendra modi ne kaha he ki 'nirbhaya ko mat bhoolanaa

 Ram Madhav wrote on Facebook that on April 1, a resolution was passed in the BJP executive of Jammu and Kashmir state condemning the heinous rape of a minor
 aise aparaadh amanviya hai
 Any attempt to make them communal needs to be condemned
 aparaadh ko anjaam dene waalon ko kanoon ke mutabik sazaa deni chahie or nirdosh kaa utpeedan nahin karnaa chahie
 Did Ram Madhav ask Lal Singh and Chand Prakash Ganga why they were again raising questions during the inquiry in the meeting of Hindu Ekta Manch
 hindu ekta manch ke netaa unki party ke hai yaa nahin
 What was needed to bring the Hindu unity platform forward to save the accused
 koun laayaa hindu ekta manch ko aage, mahabuuba mufti hi behatar bataa sakati hai
 Omar Abdullah has said that the mob became uncontrolled at the behest of two BJP ministers
 unke khilaaf kab karrwai hogi
 If Mehbooba had come to complain to the two ministers, when will she take action
 rahul ganghi ne twit kiya he, 'aise gunaah ke doshi kaa bachaav koi kaise kar saktaa he
 It is a crime against humanity
 ham kya ho gaye hai? agar ham ek maasoom bacchee ke saath hui acolpaneey krurta main raajnneeti ko hastkshep karne dete hai?'tippaniyan You must ask your child if he is with this hatred

 Ashley J

" agar unki chintaaen badhati raheen to america ke saath rishte ko lekar unke utsaah main kami aegi

 He said that Indians have immediately seen the strategic challenges arising from China
 telis ne kaha ki hind mahaasaagar kaa kshetra tatkaal focus bindu ban gaya he

 "he said," and
 
 If this happens, India will consider itself a loser
 ’’ In response to a question from the Senate Armed Services Committee during the discussion on the Asia Pacific region, Telis said, "so the quick challenge is that we are with India, for this we have to reassure India That we will clearly continue in our role as guarantors in the security of the Asian region

 sonia gandhi kii tabiyat thik nahin rahati,rahul gandhiko party kaa upaadhyaksh banaaya gaya, lekin parinaam jyon kaa tyon
 
 haar par haar
 
 nigamon main haare, rajyon main haare or loksabhaa chunaavon main bhi haare
 Defeat on defeat
 
 But as the chain of defeat increased, the necklace became more ruthless
 jaahir he samarthakon or kaaryakartaaon kaa hausala jawaab dena hi tha
 a demand arose that Priyanka Gandhi be brought
 amethi or raibareli main raajnneetik paryaton karne vaali priyanka gandhi ne inkaar kar diya
 Demand continued, Galafad
 
 But Nasonia did not pay any heed to the demands of the activists
 
 But after defeat after defeat, Congress workers have now opened the front against Rahul Gandhi
 kaaryakartaaon ne ab naa to sonia kii maang kii he, naa priyanka kii nahin, rahul se to ve naaraaz hi he
 But now the opposition of Rahul Gandhi has started in public
 party kaaryakartaaon kii ore se ab sonia, priyanka ke bajaay shriprakash jaiswal ko party kii patavaar thamane kii maang uthni shuru ho gai he
 In Kanpur, Congress activists publicly rejected Rahul Gandhi by putting up posters and called him naive and arrogant
 saath hi gandhi parivaar ke baahar ke netaaon ko congress kii patavaar thamani kii baat kii gai he
 These posters were commissioned by Haji Shamimul Haque in Kanpur
 poster main sonia gandhi ko 'mummy' or rahul ko 'bhaiya' kahkar sambodhit kiya gaya he
 However the funny thing is that the poster has a picture of Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi above, Rahul Gandhi has been written alive and the slogans below the poster have Rahul as arrogant and immature
 gauratlab he ki shriprakash jaiswal kaa naam koyala ghotaale main bhi aa chukaa he
 He was defeated by Murali Manohar Joshi from Kanpur Lok Sabha seat in the Lok Sabha elections
 aisa nahin he ki shriprakash jaiswal ko congress party main jimmedaariyaan nahin mili, unhen jimmedaari to mili, lekin jaiswal congress party kaa bedaa paar lagane main naakaam rahe
 It remains to be seen how much attention the party high command pays to the demand of Kanpuriya Congressmen
 kendriya sanchaar or iti mantri kapil sibbal ne ek lekh ke jariye bijepi netaa or gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi ke har tark ko khaarij kiya he
 In this article written for an English newspaper, Sibal says that Modi is talking about the driver and Pappi, calling himself a Hindu
 magar ek acha hindu aisi haalat main laaparvaahee baratane vaale driver ko naukari se nikaal detaa
 In this article, Sibal has also done many times
 magar un par baat karne se pehle dekhte hai ki sibbal ne aakhir vaaya modi kiski vakaalat kii or kise kaise gunahagaar tehraaya
 Case No
 1 Pappi, the driver and the rear seatmodi had said that 'I am a human being
 agar koi or bhi car chalaa rahaa he or main peeche baitha hum, or aise main koi papi car ke neeche aakar mar jaae, tab bhi mujhe dukhi hoga
 'sibal says that Pappi can die in only two conditions
 pehla, vah sadak par aa gaya or dhokhe se car uske upar chadh gai
 In such a situation, neither the driver nor the person sitting behind will be guilty
 doosraa, agar accident driver ke tej raftaar dhang se car chalaane par hua ho
 Then what will the person sitting behind do
 acha hindu kya karegaa
 Will remove the driver from the job
 exiaar darj karavaayega
 But in this case, telling Modi to sit in the back of the car, Modi explained Newton's rule of action and continued to influence the police investigation
 cese number 2 secularism kaa matlab bharat pehlemodi kehete hai ki ‘mere secularism kaa matlab he bharat pehle
 And for BJP, it means justice and appeasement to all
 ’ is par vakil sibbal tark dete hai ki deshbhakti kaa dharmanirpekshata se koi lenaa dena nahin
 a communal man can also be a patriot
 or rahi bijepi ke sabhi ko nyaay ke tark kii baat to godhra ke baad hue dangon main jis tarah se lagaataar nyaay ko nakaara gaya, usase inaki pole khul jaati he
 Case No
 3 Criticize, do not blame, Iamodi said that 'I believe that democracy remains healthy on the basis of criticism
 magar iljaam lagane ke khilaaf hum main
 'sibal counters on this that Modi has been blaming baseless feet against the Congress for the last several years
 masalan, kah rahe hai ki congress unke khilaaf sibiai kaa beja istemaal kar rahi he
 Whereas the truth is that the CBI investigates the case either at the behest of the state government or the court
 gujarat ke maamle main court ke aadesh par hi sibiai jaanch kar rahi he
 But Modi hides this truth from the people
 cese number 4 bijepi mishan, congress kamishnamodi ne kaha tha ki ‘bijepi party vid mishan he, jabaki congress party vid kamishan’
 On this, Kapil Sibal told Narendra Modi that the BJP is a party with bilashak mission
 magar iskaa mishan he rajya sangrakshit hinsa karwaanaa, farji encounter karwaanaa
 Regarding the commission, so much of the commission in the works done in Gujarat could not be known, hence Modi has been opposing the appointment of Lokayukta
 cese number 5 main hindu hum or rashtravaadi hum
 Sibal Modi says, 'I am a Hindu nationalist because i was born as a Hindu
 ’ yahaan sibbal ke kutark sidhe sidhe saamne aate hai
 Modi was asked the question whether you are a Hindu nationalist or a business manager
 is par unhone pehla vikalp chunate hue kaha tha ki main hindu to hum hi, kyonki isi dharm main maine janm liya he
 And for me the country is at the top so i am a nationalist
 magar sibbal ne sandarbh katkar yah kot kiya or phir shuru kii apni vakaalat
 He said that Modi does not understand the difference between patriotism and nationalism
 modi ko lagata he ki har shaks jo hindu dharm main paidaa hua, hindu rashtravaadi he
 Whereas i want to say that some people born in Hinduism are anti-national
 rashtrawaad kaa dharm se koi lenaa dena nahin he
 Sunrisers Hyderabad, who reached the final last year, will start their IPL campaign on Sunday, with all eyes on the returning David Warner
 hyderabad kii team ipel ke 12wein sanskaran ke apane pehle match main do baar kii champion kolkata niterides (keker) ke khilaaf uske ghar main utregi

 The Australian opener did not play in the previous IPL after the ball tampering episode in Cape Town and is now set to return to the IPL with Steve Smith
 warner or smith par gend se chhedchhad ke liye ek saal kaa pratibandh laga tha, jabaki yuva camran bancroft ko nau maheene tak pratibandhit kiya gaya tha
 Interestingly, exactly one year ago today (march 24, 2018), the ball tampering case came out on the third day of the Cape Town Test against South Africa
 warner or smith donon apni apni ipel tiimon main prabhaav chhodane kii ummid lagaae honge
 Although his ban ends on March 28, the left-handed opener can play in the franchise league and will be hoping to stake claim to Australia's World Cup squad due to his brilliant performance
 udhar, australia ke purv salaami ballebaaj mathew heden kaa maananaa he ki steve smith or david warner ipel main acha nahin bhi khele, to bhi vishwa cap team main unka chayan tay he
 Smith and Warner, who have faced a one-year ban in the ball tampering case, will be keenly watched by Cricket Australia
 heden ne press trust se kaha ,‘warner or smith ke paas yah kuch cricket khilne kaa mauka he varanaa unhen abhyaas hi nahin miltaa
 Hayden said, "these two will be in the World Cup squad, regardless of their performance in the IPL
 vishwa cap team se unhen baahar nahin kiya jayega
 'he said,' IPL will make a big difference
 gendbaajon ke liye kaarybhaar ahm hota he, lekin ballebaajon ke liye aisa kuch nahin

 cricket premiyon kii nigahen 1 june se shuru hone vaali isisi champions trophy par tiki hui hai
 Before that, a bad news is coming for the fans of the Indian team
 champions trophy main india ke khilne par sankat mandara rahaa he
 The reason for this is being attributed to the controversial 'big Three formula' between the BCCI and the ICC
 ‘big thri formule’ ko lekar donon board ke adhikariyon ke bich chali baatcheet kaa koi hal nahin nikal sakaa he or agar india champions trophy se hatane kaa faisla letaa he to isse vishwa cricket ko bada nuksaan hoga
 The Big Three formula is designed to share the board of three countries (india, Australia and England) and to get the most out of all countries
 isisi ke nae niyamon ke anusaar kisi bhi isisi toornament main hone vaali kamai main bharat kii hissedari ke saath-saath uski aadhikarik takat ko simit karne kaa faisla liya he
 Due to which the BCCI is angry
 philhal bharat main ipel jari he
 Its final match will be played on May 21, just 10 days after that the Champions Trophy will begin
 agar sabakuch thik rahaa to bharat kaa pehla muqabla 4 june ko pakistan ke saath khelnaa tay he
 Cricket series between India and Pakistan have not been seen for a long time and cricket lovers were waiting for this match
 bharat ne 2002 (sanyukt vijeta) or 2013 main do baar champions trophy jiti he
 There is currently a month in the Champions Trophy

 is ek pratishat ne sudhaar ke naam par rajya ke paas jamaa sansadhano ko apane hit main batora he
 Let us discuss the situation of private jobs today, the sky of sorrows will burst, you will not be able to handle
 ham aaj ek mahatvapurn mode par hai
 We should do a comparative study of the resources, capacity and corporate experiences of the state
 ek kii keemat par use dhwast karte hue karporate kaa pet bharne se vyapak aabaadi kaa bhala nahin hua
 The situation would not have been worse if the corporate had created jobs under Modi rule
 magar ab karporate ke paas sirf taxi or bike se delivery bvaay paidaa karne kaa hi idia bachaa he
 Liberalization has hollowed out the state in every way
 rajya ne sansadhano kaa vistaar to kiya magar kshamtaaon kaa nahin
 Today, the state budget is several lakh crores more than before
 lekin inke dam par rajya ne janata kii seva karne kii kshamta viksit nahin kii
 Employment in the government sector declined
 ghatiya ho gaya
 Contractors had fun and part of contract workers were punished
 is sandarbh main congress kaa ghoshnaptr rajya ke sansadhano ko rajya kii kshamta viksit karne kii taraf ja rahaa he
 This is not a new idea but it is a better idea
 congress ne 5 karod garib pariwaron ko pratimah 6000 dene kaa vaada kiya he
 In the Economic Survey of Modi government this thing came in 2016 but the government kept sleeping
 jab rahul gandhi ne isaki charchaa chhedi to kitne kam samay main 10 karod kisaanon ko saal main 6000 dene kii yojana aa gai
 This is proof that the standard of living of the common people is very poor
 itnaa karaab ki ujjwala yojana ke tahat silendar dene par dobaaraa silendar nahin kareed paa rahe hai
 The cylinder is placed and the food is cooking on the wooden stove next to it
 hamane dedh saal kii naukari series main dekha he
 Every state is a criminal
 pariksha ayog naujavaanon kii zindagi ko barbaad karne kii yojana hai
 This means that Rahul Gandhi has seen this fact
 ek saal main centre sarkaar kii 4 lakh naukariyaan bharne kaa vaada kiya he
 That too will be filled after the election is over
 modi sarkaar ne paanch saal bhartiyon band kar deen
 Soon after the election, the railway vacancy was taken out
 uske pehle supreme court centre se lekar rajyon ko fatkaarta rahaa ki police bal main 5 lakh pad khaali hai, inaki bhartee kaa road map dijie
 It is obvious that this unemployment has also been increased by the criminal negligence of the government and the state governments
 rahul rajyon ko bhi naukariyaan dene ke liye majaboor karne kii baat kar rahe hai
 They will get funds from the center only when they fill their two million jobs here
 rojgaar se sambandhit kuch vaade or bhi mahatvapurn hai
 It has been promised to fill the vacant posts of Scheduled Castes, Tribes and obcs within 12 months
 aarakshan ko lekar bhrantiyaan failaai jaati hai magar yah kabhi miltaa nahin he

 Only three percent
 vahi haal central uniwarsity main he
 is everywhere
 agar 12 maheene ke bheetar in padon ko bharaa jayega to kai hazaar naujavaanon ko naukari milegi
 Apart from this, there is a matter of changing the service rule to reserve 33 percent posts for women in central government recruitment
 90 ke dashak se yah baat rekhaankit kii ja rahi he ki nyaaypalika main anusuchit jati, janajati or obisi, alpsankhyak kaa pratinidhitiv bahut hi kam he
 It is too much to say less
 darasal naganya he
 The Congress has promised that it will improve it and increase the level of their representation
 modi sarkaar main garib savarnon ko aarakshan mila he
 They will now see that the state will never be serious about their reservation
 jab dalit or obisi jaise raajnneetik rup se shaktishaalee tabake ke pratinidhitiv kaa yah haal he to garib savarnon ko kya mil jayega
 The government higher education system in India was demolished after liberalization
 isamen congress ke das saal or bijepi ke bhi vaajapeyi or modi ke das saal hai
 Thousands of strange private institutions were opened across the country
 mahangi fees ke baad bhi in hazaron main se mushkil se das bees santhaan bhi stareey nahin hue
 Whereas the state gave them so much
 kisaanon se zaminein lekar kam daamon par zaminein di
 After this, these people closed the university and opened different shops in it
 is prakriya main chand log hi majboot hue
 With this money, he bought tickets for Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha and reached Parliament
 zilon or kasbon main kalege ko dhwast karne kaa aarthik boj vahaan ke noujvaan ne uthaaya
 His qualifications did not extend
 jisase kam kamaane laayak hue or agar rajdhaniyon or dilli tak aae to us padhai ke liye lakhon kharch karnaa padaa jisase ve or garib hue
 Rahul Gandhi has said that he will create a network of government colleges
 shiksha par 6 pratishat karch karenge
 This is the way
 gaanv kasbon ke naujavaanon ko padhai ke dauraan garibi se bachaane ke liye iske alaava koi rasta nahin he
 The Congress' manifesto sparks new debate in the field of judiciary
 congress ne kaha he ki vah desh bhar main chah apil court kii sthapana karegi
 Not everyone from all over the country will have to come to Delhi to challenge the decision of the High Court of the states
 bich main hi maujuud in apil court se uske maamle kaa nipataara ho saktaa he
 This will reach the justice of the Supreme Court and the common people
 kyon hardik patel ko apil ke liye supreme court aana padaa? isi ke tarj par rajyon ke bheetar hoicourt kii bench kaa bhugolic vistaar karne kii maang jor pakad sakati he
 Congress also had to see this
 meerut main alag bench kii maang vaazib he
 This thing also had to be taken care of
 supreme court ko sanvaidhanik court kaa darja dene kii baat he
 Constitutional cases passing through different benches take a lot of time
 moulik adhikaar kii vyakhya ho yaa ram mandir kaa hi maamla
 The matter moves from a small bench to a large bench and even larger benches and different interpretations continue to emerge
 aapane dekha hoga ki america ke supreme court main saare jaj ek saath baithte hai or maamle ko sunakar nipataate hai
 Constitutional matters should be decided in this way
 yah bahes puraani he magar congress ne vaada kar yah sanket diya he ki vah rajya or nyaaypalika ke dhaanche main badlaav karnaa chaahati he
 In the very first session of the 17th Lok Sabha, the Congress has promised to enact a new law to prevent and punish hate crimes like arson, murder by rampaging mobs
 congress kaa yah vaada saahasik he ki vah modi sarkaar kii banaai gai elactoral band ko band kar degi
 This scheme is opaque
 pataa nahin chalata ki kin logon ne bijepi ko 1000 karod se zyada kaa chanda diya he
 The whole debate was that the name of the donor should be transparent, but the law was reversed
 iske alaava congress ne rashtriya chunaav kosh sthapit karne kaa vaada kiya he
 To which anyone can contribute
 behatar he in sab par charchaa ho
 In my view, the promise that the Congress has made to the media in its manifesto should be taken into consideration
 abhi tel company vaala sau channel kharid letaa he
 The mining company sets up a channel overnight, does sycophancy and disappears by closing the channel after taking profit from the government
 ise cross onership kehete hai
 Due to this disease, the same industrial house is doing well in the state of a different party and is campaigning against the government of the other party
 patrakarita main aayaa hua sankat kisi ankar se nahin sulajhegaa
 Cross will be by removing the disease of ownership
 media is bahes ko hi aage nahin badhayega
 If this debate happens, then the general public will know the pattern of its black business
 congress ne kaha he ki media main "ekadhikaar rokane ke liye kanoon paarit karegi taaki vibhinn kshetron ke cross swaamitv tathaa anya vyavsaayik sanghathanon dwaara media par niyantran na kiya ja sake
 "today a business house has dozens of channels
 janata kii awaz ko dabaane or sarkaar ke bakawaas ko janata par din raat thopane kaa kaam in channelon or akhabaaron se ho rahaa he
 If you are a supporter of the BJP and do not agree with the Congress manifesto, then discuss this aspect out loud so that the media changes
 2008 main congress ne yah sankat dekh liya tha, us par report taiyaar kii gai magar kuch nahin kiya
 After 2014, Congress has seen this crisis in a deeper way
 paanch saal main media ke zarie vipaksh ko khatm kiya gaya
 The reason for that was cross ownership
 ab congress ko samaj aa gaya he
 But will she be able to clash with the big industrial houses that have taken over the country's politics
 ve netaaon ke dada ho gaye hai
 Even the Prime Minister feels compelled in front of him
 meri baat yaad rakhiegaa
 The Congress may not do anything by promising, but this is a danger that the people of India will have to stand up to overcome these days
 main media main rahun yaa na rahun magar ye din aayega
 The public will have to struggle with the media for their voice
 main rahul gandhi ko is ek morche par ladate hue dekhnaa chahta hum
 They may lose but make the promise made in their manifesto to the public and make it a big issue
 aap bhi congress par dabaav daalen
 Remind him of this promise daily
 bharat kaa bhala hoga

 salmaan khan kii film 'bajrangi bhaijan' box offis par jabardast pradarshan kar hi rahi he
 Not only this, Bajrangi Bhaijaan has also won the hearts of the cinematographers of Pakistan
 yahi vajah jo is film ko pakistani darshak kai-kai baar dekh rahe hai
 Many youngsters of Pakistan are watching this film twice
 pakistanke kuch yuvaaon ne yah film do baar dekhi he aise darshakon main momina rana bhi shaamil hai
 He says that this is probably the first Indian film in which Pakistan has been shown positively
 vah kahati hai ki vah bollywood ke filmkaaron kii soch main aae is badlaav ko dekh kar khush hai
 He said, the common people of both Pakistan and India like peace
 isiilie is film ko yahaan or bharat main donon hi jagah itani adhik saraahna mili he
 i would like to see this film again and again because such a film is not made every day
 pakistan film vitarak sangh ke adhyaksh joraayej lashaari ne kaha ki'bajrangi bhaijan'kii badaulat is saal id kii chhuttiyaan bahut acchhee gujarin
 Lashari said, there has been a great response from the public
 desh ke 80 se zyada cinemaghar id (18 july) se hi 'bajrangi bhaijan' dekhne vaale logon se khachaakhach bhare hai
 People of all classes and all ages are seen standing in long queues to book their seats in the cinema hall
 unhone kaha ki film apane duusare saptaah main pravesh kar chuki he or shandaar kaarobaar kar rahi he kyonki bollywood kii koi nai film philhal ai nahin he
 Regarding the Pakistani films released with 'bajrangi Bhaijaan' on the occasion of Eid, Lashari said, two Pakistani films 'ronge Numbers' and 'bin Roe' are also doing well at the box office but they have no one with 'bajrangi Bhaijaan' No match input:pti Cheteshwar Pujara (111 not out) and captain Gautam Gambhir (94) helped India Blue to a solid start against India Red on Saturday, the first day of the Duleep Trophy final
 shahid vijay singh pathik cricket stadium main pehali baar gulabi gend se khele ja rahe din-raat vaale dalip trophy ke is final match main din kaa khel khatm hone tak india blue ne teen wicket khokar 362 ran bana liye hai
 Dinesh Karthik returned unbeaten after scoring 55 runs with Pujara
 pujaara ne thoka shatak, gambhir ne kheli 94 ran kii paritos jeet karbalebajikarne utari india blue team ko gambhir or mayank agarwal (54) ne behtareen shuruyaat di
 Both added 144 runs for the first wicket
 donon ballebaajon ne pichley match kii tarah hi shandaar ballebaaji jari rakhi or toornament main lagaataar chauthi baar shatkeey saajhedaari kii
 This is Gambhir's fourth consecutive half-century in this tournament
 vah durbhagyavash ise shatak main nahin badal sake
 This dangerous duo was broken by all-rounder Stuart Binny
 unhone mayank ko shikhar dhawan ke haathon kaich out karavaaya
 At the other end, Gambhir made some good shots and looked like he would complete his century this time, but in an effort to cut the ball from Chinaman Kuldeep Yadav, the ball went to the wickets taking the inner edge of his bat
 178 ke kul score par out hone vaale gambhir ne 145 gendon par aath chauke lagaapujara or karthik ke bich hui 120 ran kii saajhedaarifinal match ke liye team main shaamil kiye gaye rohit sharma (30) nepujarake saath pari ko aage badhaayaa
 The duo, playing sparingly, added 64 runs for the third wicket and raised the team's score to 242
 lekin tabhi rohit leg spinner amit mishra kii gend ko sweep karne ke prayaas main dhawan ko kaich thama baithe
 Pujara stood at one end and needed someone to be on the other end
 karthik ne unka acha saath diya or din kaa khel khatm hone tak wicket par tike rahe
 The 120-run partnership for the fourth wicket has been shared between the two batsmen
 is jodi ne 5
 This partnership played at a speed of 10 runs
 pujaara ne apni shatkeey pari main ab tak 164 gendon kaa saamana kiya he or 15 chauke laga chuke hai
 Karthik has so far hit eight fours in 68 balls

 Photo: In the second ODI, if Team India gives England a 3–0 decisive lead, it will also take revenge for the defeat in the ODI series in England, while the disappointment of the whitewash on this tour
 Will also be left behind to some extent
 mahendra singh dhoni kii team ne hyderabad or dilli main khele pehle do maichon main aasaan jeet darj kii thi
 The hosts won 126 in the first ODI in Hyderabad and the second match in Delhi by eight wickets
 bharat kii yuva team england ke khilaaf apane dabadabe ko barkaraar rakhana chaahegi
 dhoni-raina's dalliance against England in the first ODI will also be inspired by the fact that he has moved up to fourth place in the ICC ODI rankings with a 2–0 lead, and with another win at this place
 The claim will become stronger
 tisare match kii wicket se haalanki spinneron ke mukaable tej gendbaajo ko adhik sahaayta milane kii ummid he
 In the absence of senior players like Sachin Tendulkar, Virender Sehwag and Zaheer Khan, the youth brigade was responsible for the team's victory in the first two games due to the injury
 bisisiai ne bhi iske baad baaki bache teen maichon ke liye isi team ko barkaraar rakhaa
 Barring poor form, Harbhajan Singh has once again been overlooked, which will lead to India's inexperienced bowling attack once again by pacer Praveen Kumar
 baari dabaav ke baavjood bharat ke anubhavheen tej gendbaajon ne ab tak acha pradarshan kiya he
 Praveen Kumar has bowled fluently while young Umesh Yadav has impressed with his pace and wicket-taking ability
 yadav ne haalanki adhik ran kharch kiye hai
 r Vinaykumar played an excellent role in the middle overs and was instrumental in helping India win by taking four wickets in Delhi
 bharat kii yah tej gendbaaji jodi ab mohali ke wicket par gendbaaji karne ke liye betaab hogi jise apni teji or oochaal ke liye janaa jaataa he
 r Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja, who have taken four wickets in the series so far, have not let the team miss Harbhajan with their spin spell
 alrounder ke rup main jadeja kii maujuudagi team ko santulit karti he or dhoni ko atirikt gendbaaj bhi detii he
 However, what is most satisfying for India is the performance of its batsmen
 salaami ballebaajon parthiv patel or ajinkya rahane ko chhodkar uske sabhi ballebaajon ne pehle do maichon main ran banaaye
 While captain Dhoni's aggressive innings in Hyderabad led the team to victory, youngsters Virat Kohli and Gautam Gambhir dominated in Delhi
 england ke 237 ran ke lakshya kaa peechha karte hue kohli ne naabad 112 jabaki gambhir ne naabad 84 ran kii pari kheli jisase bharat ne 36
 Achieved the target in 4 overs
 bharat ke liye ekmaatr chintaa salaami ballebaajon parthiv or rahane kaa pradarshan he lekin dhoni ke vijayi sangyojan ke saath chhedchhad karne kii sambhaavna kam hi he
 On the other hand, there will be a lot of pressure on the England team not to perform well in the subcontinent conditions where the ball is low
 mehmaan team ke liye guuruuvaar kaa match karo yaa maro kaa muqabla he kyonki ek or match main haar ke saath team shrinkhalaa ganvaa degi
 The team has so far failed in every department of the game
 haal main bharat ke england daure par dhoni kii team ko jeet se maharoom rakhane vaali team maujuuda shrinkhalaa ke pehle do maichon main 50 over tak ballebaaji karne main bhi naakaam rahi he
 The team has great batsmen in captain Alastair Cook, Craig Keyswetter, Jonathan Trott, Kevin Pietersen and Ravi Bopara but has failed to perform as a unit
 england ne pehle do maichon main ian bel ko mauka nahin diya he jo hairaani bharaa faisla he or is ballebaaj kaa tisare match main khelnaa lagbhag tay he
 England's bowling has also been mediocre so far in the series
 steven fin, jed darnbek or tim bracenain bhartiya ballebaajon ko pareshaan karne main naakaam rahe hai jisase jaahir he ki team ko bhartiya paristhitiyon main apane anbhavi gendbaajon james anderson or stuart broad kii kami khal rahi he
 The England spin duo of Graeme Swann and Samit Patel have also failed to take advantage of the conditions against which Indian batsmen scored plenty of runs in the first two matches
 shaam ko os ahm bhoomika nibhaa sakati he or aise main toss jeetne vaali team pehle gendbaaji kaa faisla karke mohali ke wicket se shuruuaat main milane vaali madad kaa phayda uthaanaa chaahegi
 The teams are: India: Mahendra Singh Dhoni (captain), Gautam Gambhir, Parthiv Patel, Ajinkya Rahane, Virat Kohli, Suresh Raina, Ravindra Jadeja, r Ashwin, Varun Aaron, Umesh Yadav, r Vinay Kumar, Srinath Aravind, Rahul Sharma , Manoj Tiwari and Praveen Kumar
 england:elistare cook (captain), craig keesweater, jonathan traat, ian bel, kevin petersan, ravi bopaara, jonathan beresta, greem swaan, samit patel, tim bracenen, steven fin, stuart mikar, scot borthvik, jose butler or elex helles

 zyada jaankaree ke liye yahaan dekhen The release date of Aamir Khan's much-awaited and much awaited film PK has been finalized
 ab yah film 19 disambar ko relies hone vaali he
 Earlier, the film's release date was clashing with Anurag Kashyap's film Bombay Velvet

 — taran adarsh (@taran_adarsh)april 15, 2014jab se ajibo-garib paridhaan main tronsister latakaae aamir khan kii tasviir li hui he, is film ko lekar logon ke bich charchaa joro par he
 Since then there was considerable confusion about the release date of the film
 pehle bataaya gaya ki film 6 june ko aegi
 Then the news came out that the film would be released on 25 December
 aakhirkaar tamaam bahes or charchaa ke bich film kii yah relies date tay kii gai he
 Under the banner of Disney India, Aamir Khan Productions and UTV Motion Pictures, the film is being directed by Munnabhai series fame Rajkumar Hirani
 is film main aamir khan ke saath anoushka sharma, sushant singh rajput, boman irani or sanjay dutt hai
 The film is based on thugs operating in the guise of religion
 bollywood main yah prachlan aam he ki film ke banane se pehle hi relies date lock kar di jaati he
 For this reason, the film 'PK' was also in controversy
 darasal, anuraag kashyap kii film 'bombai velvet' christmas ke din relies ho rahi he
 The buzz was that Hirani's film 'PK' would also be released on the same day
 isse naaraaz anuraag kashyap ne ek akhbaar ko die intervyuu main bataaya, 'jab khabar udi ki yah ab christmas ko relies hogi, to maine rajkumaar hiraani se poocha
 But he refused
 lekin ab vah film usee din relies kar rahe hai, jis din meri film bombai velvet relies honi he'
 Anurag Kashyap said that only one phone call could have avoided these situations
 anuraag ke mutabik agar yah donon filmein ek hi date par relies hotin to donon kaa bijness prabhavit hota
 However, there is still only a week-long difference in the release date of the two films

 The US has asked the World Trade Organization (WTO) to recognize its argument that the Indian ban on the import of American poultry products is a violation of its obligations to the WTO
 america vyapaar pratinidhi ron kirk ne shuukravaar ko kaha ki america ne vivaad niptaan samiti gathit karne ke liye dablutio se yah aupchaarik anurodh tab kiya he, jab 16-17 april ko bharat ke saath hui baatcheet america chintaaon ko dur karne main vifal sabit hui
 Although India claims that it has taken these steps to prevent avian influenza, Kirk maintains that Indian law is contrary to current science, international guidelines and the standards India has set for its domestic industry
 kirk ne kaha, 'yah jaruri he ki america kisaanon ko vah vishwasaneey bazaar pahunch sulabh ho, jisapar bharat sahamat hua he
 "the US holds the highest standard of safety in its agricultural industry," Kirk said, and is confident that the WTO would agree that Indian restrictions on US imports are wrong
 'bharat kaa kahana he ki uske paas un deshon se aayaat par pratibandh lagane kaa puraa adhikaar he, jahaan kam rogajanak avian influenza ke prakope kii khabaren hongi
 This is the only avian influenza found in the US since 2004
 kirk ne kaha he, 'lagata he ki bharat ne aplikeshan of sanity and phitosenitory (espies) megers par dablutio ke samjhaute ke tahat apane dayitvon ke vipareet karrwai kii he
 Its steps are not based on international guidelines or any statutory risk assessment
 vah yah sunishti kara paane main bhi vifal rahaa he ki uske kadam america jaise deshon se aayaat ke khilaaf anuchitarup se bhedbhaavpurn na hon
 Kirk's move has been welcomed by the National Chicken Council, the National Turkey Federation and the USA Poultry and Egg Export Council

 The Congress has taken seriously the criticism of party president Sonia Gandhi and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh by Kadapa's own dissatisfied MP Jaganmohan Reddy's TV channel, but has decided not to take any action that would make him a 'hero'
 andhra pradesh ke party ke varisht netaa ke keshav raav ne kaha, ‘‘jaganmohan shaayad chaahate hai ki party unke khilaaf koi karrwai kare, jisase vah hero ban jaaen
 But a party like the Congress does not take any step in haste and takes action keeping all the things in mind

 ' viraat kohli ke phir shatak ko bade shatak main nahin badal paane se niraash is yuva ballebaaj ke coach rajkumaar sharma ne ummid jataai ki australia ke khilaaf vartmaan shrunkhlaa main unka yah priy shishy 'daddy handred' banane main safal rahegaa
 Kohli scored a 107-run knock against Australia in Chennai, but this is the fourth occasion, while he could not stay at the crease for long after scoring a century
 kohli ne shatak puraa karne ke baad of spinner nathan leone kii gend hawa main khelkar mid on par kaich thama diya tha
 On three previous occasions, he had scored 116, 103 and 103 runs
 coach rajkumaar sharma ne kaha, main uske out hone ke tareeke se khush nahin hum
 We initially adopted the strategy of dominating Leon, as he is a weak link to the Australian invasion, but his shot selection was not right
 england ke ballebaaji coach graham gooch ne ek baar apane cricketron ko 'daddy handred' yani bada shatak banane ke liye kaha tha or rajkumaar sharma bhi kohli ko yahi paath padhaa rahe hai
 He said, he is fond of playing long innings and he also wants to score a big century
 main ab usase is bare main baat karuunga
 i am happy that he was successful in scoring a century in the first match of the series
 isse uskaa aatmavishvaas badhegaa
 i am confident that in the next matches you will see 'daddy Hundred' with his bat
 kohli england or pakistan ke khilaaf ek-divasiy maichon main apekshit pradarshan nahin kar paae the or isliye australian shrunkhlaa ke liye unhone vishesh taiyaari kii thi
 The comments sharma ne kaha, kohli ne apni academy (west dilli cricket academy) main lagaataar taiyaari kii thi
 The academy remains open for only three days, but i called the bowler for the remaining three days for Kohli and kept a close watch on his batting
 vah kaaphi mehnat karke is shrunkhlaa main utraa tha
 He said, he was confident of scoring a century only after completing his half-century yesterday
 meri usase baat hui thi
 i told him that the Australians would come up with a new strategy and lay a trap for that and that's exactly what happened
 sharma ne kaha, maine usase kah diya ki forward short leg or short midwicket par kshetrarakshak lagaaya jayega
 We were already prepared for his plan
 eemaandaaree se kahuun to, jo main soch rahaa tha vaisaa hi hua
 If he did not play the wrong shot, he could play a big innings
 kohli ne australia ke khilaaf chennai main 107 ran kii pari kheli, lekin yah chauthaa avasar he, jabaki vah shatak jamaane ke baad zyada der tak krij par nahin tik paae
 Kohli, after completing the century, was caught by off-spinner Nathan Lyon in the air at mid-on
 isse pehle ke teen avasaron par unhone 116, 103 or 103 ran banaae the
 Coach Rajkumar Sharma said, i am not happy with the way he was out
 hamane shuru main hi leone par haaavee hone kii ranneeti apanaai thi, kyonki vah australia ke akraman kii kamjor kadi he, lekin uske shot kaa chayan sahi nahin tha
 England's batting coach Graham Gooch once asked his cricketers to make 'daddy Hundred' or big century and Rajkumar Sharma is also teaching this lesson to Kohli
 unhone kaha, vah lambii pari khilne kaa shaukeen he or vah bhi chahta he ki vah bada shatak lagaae
 i will talk to him about this now
 mujhe khushi he ki vah shrunkhlaa ke pehle match main shatak lagane main safal rahaa
 This will boost his confidence
 mujhe puraa vishwaas he ki agle maichon main aapako uske balle se 'daddy handred' dekhne ko milegaa
 Kohli did not perform as expected in the one-day matches against England and Pakistan and hence he made special preparations for the Australian series
 tippaniyan Sharma said, Kohli had continued preparations at his academy (west Delhi Cricket Academy)
 academy keval teen din hi khuli rahati he, lekin maine kohli ke liye baaki teen din bhi gendbaaj bulawaae or uski ballebaaji par baariki se najar rakhi
 He worked hard and landed in this series
 unhone kaha, vah kal ardhashatak puraa karne ke baad hi shatak jamaane ke prati aashwast tha
 i talked to him
 maine usase kaha tha ki australian nai ranneeti ke saath utrenge or uske liye jaal bichhaayenge or thik vaisaa hi hua
 Sharma said, i told him that the forward short leg and short midwicket will be fielded
 ham unki is yojana ke liye pehle se hi taiyaar the
 To be honest, what i was thinking happened
 yadi vah galat shot nahin kheltaa, to badi pari khel saktaa tha
 Coach Rajkumar Sharma said, i am not happy with the way he was out
 hamane shuru main hi leone par haaavee hone kii ranneeti apanaai thi, kyonki vah australia ke akraman kii kamjor kadi he, lekin uske shot kaa chayan sahi nahin tha
 England's batting coach Graham Gooch once asked his cricketers to make 'daddy Hundred' or big century and Rajkumar Sharma is also teaching this lesson to Kohli
 unhone kaha, vah lambii pari khilne kaa shaukeen he or vah bhi chahta he ki vah bada shatak lagaae
 i will talk to him about this now
 mujhe khushi he ki vah shrunkhlaa ke pehle match main shatak lagane main safal rahaa
 This will boost his confidence
 mujhe puraa vishwaas he ki agle maichon main aapako uske balle se 'daddy handred' dekhne ko milegaa
 Kohli did not perform as expected in the one-day matches against England and Pakistan and hence he made special preparations for the Australian series
 tippaniyan Sharma said, Kohli had continued preparations at his academy (west Delhi Cricket Academy)
 academy keval teen din hi khuli rahati he, lekin maine kohli ke liye baaki teen din bhi gendbaaj bulawaae or uski ballebaaji par baariki se najar rakhi
 He worked hard and landed in this series
 unhone kaha, vah kal ardhashatak puraa karne ke baad hi shatak jamaane ke prati aashwast tha
 i talked to him
 maine usase kaha tha ki australian nai ranneeti ke saath utrenge or uske liye jaal bichhaayenge or thik vaisaa hi hua
 Sharma said, i told him that the forward short leg and short midwicket will be fielded
 ham unki is yojana ke liye pehle se hi taiyaar the
 To be honest, what i was thinking happened
 yadi vah galat shot nahin kheltaa, to badi pari khel saktaa tha
 He said, he is fond of playing long innings and he also wants to score a big century
 main ab usase is bare main baat karuunga
 i am happy that he was successful in scoring a century in the first match of the series
 isse uskaa aatmavishvaas badhegaa
 i am confident that in the next matches you will see 'daddy Hundred' with his bat
 kohli england or pakistan ke khilaaf ek-divasiy maichon main apekshit pradarshan nahin kar paae the or isliye australian shrunkhlaa ke liye unhone vishesh taiyaari kii thi
 The comments sharma ne kaha, kohli ne apni academy (west dilli cricket academy) main lagaataar taiyaari kii thi
 The academy remains open for only three days, but i called the bowler for the remaining three days for Kohli and kept a close watch on his batting
 vah kaaphi mehnat karke is shrunkhlaa main utraa tha
 He said, he was confident of scoring a century only after completing his half-century yesterday
 meri usase baat hui thi
 i told him that the Australians would come up with a new strategy and lay a trap for that and that's exactly what happened
 sharma ne kaha, maine usase kah diya ki forward short leg or short midwicket par kshetrarakshak lagaaya jayega
 We were already prepared for his plan
 eemaandaaree se kahuun to, jo main soch rahaa tha vaisaa hi hua
 If he did not play the wrong shot, he could play a big innings

 Thus, the record of scoring four centuries in the first four matches as captain was still in the name of Cook and Gavaskar
 cook kaa yah shrunkhlaa main lagaataar teesraa shatak he
 In this way he joins the ranks of Everton Vicks, Gary Sobers, Ken Barrington and his current coach Andy Flower, who have scored centuries in three consecutive matches in India

 hamend ne pehali baar varsh 1928-29 main australia ke khilaaf, or duusari baar varsh 1933 main australia or newzealand ke khilaaf lagaataar teen test maichon main teen-teen shatak lagaae

 The list of other English batsmen who once did this includes Herbert Sutcliffe, Dennis Compton, Jeffrey Boycott, Ellen Lamb, Chris Broad, Graham Gooch, Ian Bell, Andrew Strauss, and Ravi Bopara
 vaise sabase zyaada lagaataar maichon main shatak thokane kaa record australia ke sar don breadman ke naam he, jinhone varsh 1937-38 main england ke khilaaf lagaataar chah maichon main shatak lagaae the

 This is his third and 23rd total of the series, which is a new record for England
 ab tak yah record hamend, coudre, bykaat, cook or petersan ke naam par tha
 Of these, Hammond first set a record in August 1939 for his country's hundreds of hundreds
 tab se yah record unheen ke naam par darj tha
 He was later equaled by other players, but Cook was the first batsman to break his record
 apana 86waan match khel rahe cook ne apni is pari ke dauraan 88waan ran banaate hi test cricket main 7000 ran bhi puure kiye
 Cook is now only 27 years 347 days old and thus he broke the record of Tendulkar at the youngest to complete 7000 runs
 test cricket main sarvaadhik ran banane vaale tendulkar jab is mukaam par pahunche the tab unki umr 28 saal 193 din thi
 He is the tenth English batsman to reach this milestone
 unase pehle england kii taraf se graham gooch, alek stewart, david gavar, bykaat, mike ethraton, colin coudre, petersan, hamend or andrew strans yah uplabdhi hasil kar chuke hai

 You all know that Bhai Dooj is a festival of reverence and trust of sisters towards brothers
 is parv ko har saal karthik maas ke shukla paksh kii dwitiya tithi ke din hi manaaya jaataa he
 The sisters celebrate this festival by applying tilak on the foreheads of their brothers
 or bhagwaan se apane bhaaiyon kii lambi aayu kii kaamana karti hai
 In fact, in Hindu society, this festival, symbolizing the affection and harmony of brother and sister, is celebrated two days after Deepawali
 kyonki yah din yama dwitiya bhi kehalaata he
 Therefore Yama Dev is also worshiped on this festival
 ek manyata ke anusaar is din jo yama dev kii upasna karata he, use asamay mrityu kaa bhay nahin rahata he
 Like other festivals of Hindus, this festival is also associated with traditions
 is din bahanen apane bhai ko tilak lagaakar or uphaar dekar uski lambi aayu kii kaamana karti hai
 In return, the brother pledges to protect his sister
 is din bhai kaa apni bahan ke ghar bhojan karnaa vishesh rup se shubh hota he
 According to a mythological belief about Bhai Dooj, Yamuna had fasted for the long life of his brother Yamraj on this day, and fed him the food of Annakoot
 mithila nagari main is parv ko aaj bhi yamadvitiya ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 On this day rice is applied in both hands of brothers
 or saath hi kuch sthanon main bhai ke haathon main sindur lagane kii bhi parampara dekhi jaati he
 After applying vermilion and rice paste in the hands of brother, five betel leaves, betel nut and silver coin are placed on it, chanting mantra for the brother's longevity by pouring water over it
 bhai apni bahan ko uphaar dete he
 The festivals associated with brotherhood are related to the festivals associated with brothers and sisters, raksha-bandhan and Bhai-dooj are special festivals
 katha ke anusaar yama devtaa ne apni bahan ko isi din darshan diye thea
 Yam's sister Yamuna was extremely distraught to meet her sister
 apane bhai ke darshan kar yamuna behad prasann hui
 Yamuna was happy and paid a lot of respect to her brother
 yama ne prasann hokar use vardaan diya ki is din agar bhai-bahan donon ek saath yamuna nadi main snaan karegein, to unhen mukti praapt hogi
 For this reason, bathing in this Yamuna river with brother and sister is of great importance
 iske alaava yama ne yamuna ne apane bhai se vachan liya ki aaj ke din har bhai ko apni bahan ke ghar janaa chahie
 Since then, the practice of celebrating Bhai Dooj has been going on
 jin bhaiyon kii bahanen dur hoti he
 Those brothers go to meet their sisters on Bhaiduj
 or unase tikaa karakar uphaar aadi dete hai
 How to celebrate Bhai Dooj festival 1
 bhai dooj parv par bahanen praat: snaan kar, apane isht dev kaa pujan karti he
 She prepares chowk with rice flour
 is chowk par bhai ko baithaaya jaataa he
 And their hands are worshiped
 bhai kii hatheli par bahanen chaaval kaa ghol lagaati he
 After putting vermilion on it, water is released on the hands slowly by placing pumpkin flowers, betel nut, mudra etc
 on the hands

 Somewhere on this day, the sisters apply tilak on the forehead of their brothers and perform their aarti and then tie kalava in the palm
 bhai kaa munh meetha karne ke liye bhaiyon ko maakhan-mishri khilaati hai
 During the evening, the sisters light a chaumukh lamp in the name of Yamraj and keep the diy outside the house facing south
 is din aasmaan main udati hui chil dekhne ke vishay main yah manyata he ki bahanen bhaiyon kii aayu ke liye jo dua maangati he, vah dua puri hoti he
 Significance of Bhai Dooj festival: This festival strengthens the bond of affection between brothers and sisters
 bhartiya parampara ke anusaar vivaah ke baad kanya kaa apane ghar, maayke main kabhi-kabhaar hi aana hota he
 Family members are sometimes able to visit him on behalf of the maiden
 aanse main bhai apni bahan ke prati udasin na hon, usase sadaa sneh bana rahen, bahan ke sukh:dukh kaa pataa chalata rahen
 Brothers, do not neglect your sisters, and the relationship between the two should remain sweet
 inhi bhaawanaaon ke saath bhai dooj kaa parv manaaya jaataa he
 Bhaiyya-dooj also became hitech symbolizing love of brother and sister
 Bhaiya-dooj has also become hi-tech in step with modern era
 in dinon jahaan desh-videsh ke vibhinn sthanon par rahane vaale bhai-bahan samay kii kami ko mahasoos karte hue video conferencing kaa jamkar istemaal kar rahe hai vahiin es
 M
 es or i-mail ke jariye bhi pyaar bhare badhai sandesh die jate hai
 There was a time when the sister applied tilak on her brother's forehead, feeding her betashe and gram, showing her love for the brother, she wished her long life and day and night to quadruple the night
 magar, samay ke badalane ke saath-saath is tyohaar ne bhi apana rup badal liya he
 Now people have started using technology well
 desh-videsh main rahane vaale bhai-bahanon ne video conferencing ke jariye ek-duusare ko bhaiya dooj ke badhai sandesh bhejne shuru kar die hai
 In such a situation, why is the gift given to the sister not hi-tech
 ab bhai internet ke madhyam se bahan ke liye uphaar kharidte hai jo bahan ko gift pack main uske ghar pahunch jaaya karata he

 Crime Branch says that there is nothing in this case that should be investigated

 canada se aae mere ek ankal dakshin dilli ke ek khule manhole main gir gaye
 They left for a walk after dinner but returned after 11 hours
 unki cheekh-pukaar sunakar vahaan se guzarate ek vyakti ne unhen bachaaya
 Later, he said, if all this had happened in Toronto, the city officials would have been fined millions of dollars
 ve bhaagyashaalee the ki unhen maamuli chotein ain or ve batch gaye
 Thankfully no one else fell on them
 agle din ke akhbaar main manhole se judi teen alag-alag durghatnaon kaa zikr tha
 It would not be wrong to say that cities in India are in such an explosive situation where anything can happen at any time
 mumbai main imaaraton kaa dhahna, kolkata kii sadakon par baadh, dilli main kachare kaa ambara, ye sab aage chalakar haadason ke kaaran banate hai
 These accidents are so regular that no one is surprised when they happen
 kisi haadase ko lekar sthaneey nikaayon kaa puraa vidhaan uske baad ke prabhaavon se nipatane or uske dobaaraa hone kaa intjaar karne tak simit hota he
 More people died in the recent Texas floods than a building collapse in Mumbai
 mumbai main aisi kai imaaraten hai jo sau saal se bhi zyada puraani hai
 In a city where it is a big thing to have a roof over your head, no matter how temporary and dangerous, neither the civil administration nor the people living in dangerous buildings are concerned about changing these conditions
 aise main hairat nahin ki dilli main kachare ke 18 manzil jitne oonche pahaad kii ore logon kaa dhyaan tab tak nahin jaataa, jab tak yah bharbhara kar dhah nahin jaataa
 He will be a strange type of bureaucrat who remained indifferent to the landfill that was filled to its full potential 15 years ago

 Neither the corporation nor the people living in that street felt that they were in any way responsible for the death of the girl
 agar vah ladki choti-moti choton ke saath batch gai hoti, to shaayad us manhole ko dhankane kii jahamat bhi nahin uthaai jaati
 The reason for this heartless insensitivity has gone home in our hearts and minds is that there is hardly any value in the lives of common people
 aisi laaparvaahee har jagah he
 In the construction of a four-lane highway between Shimla and Almora, long stretches have been cut out of the hills
 ye pattiyaan bhuskhalan ke lihaaj se kaaphi samvedansheel hai or inaki bharpai nahin kii ja sakati
 In Himachal, six- to eight-floor hotels are being built in remote cities, apartments are being built on dangerous mountain slopes and are being sold as second homes in the mountains
 isi tarah bangaluru ke paas uti or kunur main ilaychi or chaay baganon ko dhani logon ke avkaash grihon ke taur par viksit kiya ja rahaa he
 As you enter Shimla, Solan, Darjeeling or Gangtok, you will be confronted with a network of haphazard and adjoining buildings, telling stories of human excesses
 yahaan kabhi bhi koi haadasa ho saktaa he
 Whenever man-made disasters occur, it clearly indicates that disastrous construction in cities as well as fragile ecological areas has reached its peak
 pichley saal chennai kii baadh, is saal mumbai or kuch saal pehle kashmir kii baadh, kedarnath main jal pralay
 All these indicate that the government will have to think about local ecology and habitat for its conservation
 mahaj maang yaa paryaton niti ke maddenjar nirmaan kii anumati nahin di ja sakati
 There is a half-incomplete and haphazard view on every side of the country
 bhartiya paridrishy main parakh kii jameen lagaataar nirmit ho rahi he, jise santulan or vivek kaa intjaar he
 But controlling the population, high pollution and poor sanitation conditions and knocking diseases, floods and garbage in the future cannot be taken seriously when the primary need of the country is employment, moving new immigrants, new Cars, to set up statutory and temporary factories and increase their effectiveness

 kohli ne buudhvaar ko dakshin africa ke khilaaf khele gaye duusare tii-20 match main 72 ranon kii naabad pari khel bharat ko jeet dilaai
 Even as a captain, Kohli has been quite successful at the international level, but his captaincy with Bengaluru has not gone so far
 hesan ne kaha, 'vah world cricket main jitne safal hai utane hi ipel main ho sakate hai
 Last night we saw another great example of how great a player he is
 vah behtareen captain bhi hai jo team kaa netritv achche se karte hai or team ko junun or sahi bhaavana ke saath aage lekar jate hai
 Kohli has also been praised by former Australian batsman Simon Katich who was appointed the head coach of Bangalore
 katich ne kaha ki kohli kaa record unki puri kahani kahata he
 Katich said, 'kohli's record tells about him
 na sirf ek khilaadi balki bhartiya team ke captain ke taur par bhi unhone jo hasil kiya he uske kaaran main unka sammaan karata hum
 He said, "the thing i like about him is that Kohli is very competitive because i like this quality within a player
 'unhone kaha, 'maine kohli ko perth test main beete saal shatak banaate hue dekha tha
 She was like an old wicket of Waka
 maine abhi tak test main jitne bhi shatak dekhe hai unamem se wo sabase acha shatak tha
 Kohli, Hessen and Katich will try to end the title drought of Bengaluru this time and get him the first IPL title
