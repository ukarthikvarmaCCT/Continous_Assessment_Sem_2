 saal 2018 ke karnataka vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan echdi kumaraswami ne kaha tha, ‘main king banuunga, kingmekar nahin
 His statement proved to be true and despite his party Janata Dal (S) being third in the election, he managed to achieve the desired position on 23 May 2018
 lekin unki pichhali pari kii tarah hi mukhyamantri ke rup main unka kaarykaal alpakaalik rahaa or 13 maheene puraani danvadol gathbandhan sarkaar aakhir gir gai
 Kumaraswamy (HD Kumaraswamy) failed to win the vote of confidence on Tuesday
 unki gathbandhan sarkaar kaa bhavishya tabhi saaf dikhne laga tha, jab congress ke 13 or janata dal (es) ke teen vidhayakon ko milakar kul 16 vidhayakon ne istipha de diya or do nirdaleey vidhayakon-aar shankar tathaa ech nagesh ne samarthan waapas le liya
 Ramalinga Reddy, a Congress MLA, later backed down from his decision to resign and said he would support the government, but all remained in vain
 mukhyamantri ke rup main kumaraswami kaa doosraa kaarykaal kathinaaiyon bharaa rahaa
 The government continued to face threats due to repeated resentment in the coalition

 The BJP, which led to Kumaraswamy losing the chief minister's chair, was the first time he became the Chief Minister of Karnataka
 kumaraswami (HD Kumaraswamy) raajnneetik maahaul main paley-bade
 He entered politics by winning Kanakpura Lok Sabha seat in 1996

 In 2004, he reached the assembly for the first time
 tab trishanku vidhansabha hone ke baad congress ke saath janata dal (es) gathbandhan sarkaar main shaamil ho gaya tha
 In 2006, Kumaraswamy rebelled and broke out of an alliance with 42 mlas, contrary to the wishes of his father and former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda
 unhone bhaajapa ke saath milakar sarkaar banaai or vidhayak ke rup main apane pehle kaarykaal ke dauraan hi vah mukhyamantri ban gaye
 He was the Chief Minister for 20 months under alternating arrangements for the post of Chief Minister
 lekin jab mukhyamantri pad ke liye bhaajapa kii baari ai to kumaraswami peeche hat gaye or bi es yediurppa sarkaar ko saat din ke bheetar hi gira diya

 Technology with connectivity 100 times faster than wifi is going to knock soon
 philhal yah takanic apane shuruaati daur main he
 It can replace wifi in the next few years
 is takanic main internet connactivity ke liye vijible lite communication (VLC) kaa yuj kiya gaya he jiske jariye isaki connactivity speed lab main 1gbps darj kii gai he, jo aam wifai se 100 guna zyada he
 For the last two years, many scientists were working on this technique
 ab is takanic ko pehali baar testing lab se baahar prayog kiya he jahaan isaki connactivity speed 1gbps test kii gai
 It is worth noting that most common wifi routers have connectivity speeds of 100mbps
 ise 'internet' kii speed naa samajhen, yah connactivity speed he
 Many times people forget to understand the connectivity speed of the device as internet speed
 udhaaharan ke taur par wifai router kii connactivity speed 100mbps hoti he jiskaa matlab, router se aapkaa smartphone yaa laptop 100mbps speed se conect ho rahaa he
 While internet speed is what service providers give you
 vaise hi li-fi kii 1gbps speed ko internet speed naa samajhen, kyonki yah router se aapke divaais ke bich kii connactivity kii speed he, jisase aapke internet speed par zyada fark nahin padegaa
 It will be beneficial in office and local networking
 If this technology starts then it will benefit greatly in local networking where all the computers are connected to the local wifi network
 Estonian company ke siio deepak solanki ne ek angreji akhbaar ko bataaya ' hamakai industriesmen is takanic kii testing ke liye payalat project chalaa rahe hai, taaki is vielsi takanic ko yuj kiya ja sake'kya he li-fi, or kisne banaaya is takanic ko
 
 
 It is a wireless technology similar to wifi in which data travel is done through Visible Light Communication (VLC)
 uniwarsity of endinburgh ke harold haas ne ne 2011 main pehali baar is takanic ko logon ke saamne demonstrate karke dikhaaya
 The pilot project is underway, he said, "currently we have designed a smart lighting solution for the industrial environment where data communication can be done through light
" iske alaava ham privet clients ke saath bhi iskaa payalat project chalaa rahe hai jahaan offis main internet acces karne ke liye li-fi network kaa yuj kiya ja sake
 Beneficial for Secure Connection This technique will also help in creating a secure network as its signals cannot cross the wall like wifi
 udhaaharan ke taur par agar ek kamare main ise lagaaya jaae to us kamare se baahar iske signal nahin jaaenge jisase isaki connactivity or bhi majboot or sicyor bhi hogi
 This is the reason why data travel was done in the lab through lifi at 224gbps maximum speed

 unhone kaha ki congress or jedies kii pratikriya se shaq kii sooyee un par jaati he
 Was the minister's nephew PWD contractor for whom generosity was shown - is it a case of nepotism? He said that even the Income Tax authorities have issued a statement saying that no MP, MLA or Minister has been searched
 unhone poocha ki kya rajya kaa ruukh sanghavaad ke liye khatra he
 Significantly, this is not the first time that Arun Jaitley has targeted the Congress
 isse pehlekendriya vittamantriarun jetali kaha tha ki congress adhyaksharahul gandhipane chunaav abhiyaan main managasaint mudde uthaa rahe hai or yadi un farji muddon ko unke bhaashan se hataa diya jaae to kuch bhi nahin bachegaa
 Arun Jaitley had said in a Facebook post that lies fall flat and voters will punish super-confident opposition leaders who spoil voters
 jetali ne kaha tha ki "rahul gandhi na sirf apni party, balki puure vipaksh ko farji or managasaint muddon par nirbhar kar diya he
 They raise bogus issues, speak to him repeatedly and then understand that their lies will come true
 samay aa gaya he ki ve jhooth ke kokun se baahar nikle anyathaa samaapt ho jaaenge
 He had said that fake issues were always raised about Rafale, Balakot, Judge Loya death, bank loan waiver, JNU issue, EVM, GST, demonetisation or Nirav Modi and Mallya or special status to Andhra Pradesh or economy and opposition Every issue fell on its face
 yadi rahul gandhi ke bhaashan se farji mudde hataa die jaaen, to vahaan kuch bachegaa hi nahin
 He accused the opposition of undermining voters' understanding
 unhone kaha tha ki matadaata bhi desh ke vipakshi dalon ko usee tarah samajhenge or unhen unki jagah dikhaa denge
 The BJP leader had said that those running the election campaign should understand that publicity will not be able to run on fake issues
 bhartiya loktantr kii vaastavik takat matadaataaon kii samaj main nihit he
 They will punish those who do not work and they will vote for those who work again

 pehle nepal se abhyaan main hissaa lene ke liye taiyaar tha or khud pradhanmantri narendra modi beete 30 agast ko sabhi ke saamne iskaa elaan kar chuke the
 But suddenly the Nepal government backed down, leaving India at a regional level

 He said that in one way Nepal was allowed to use the port of China and on the other it refused to join BIMSTEC
 khabaren yah bhi hai ki nepal or china kii sena jald hi sanyukt sainya abhyaas main hissaa le sakati hai
 The decision was taken after political controversy erupted in the country over the involvement of the Nepalese Army in the military exercises of BIMSTEC countries

 Following the Prime Minister's directive, the Nepalese military leadership had to step back from the first military exercise of BIMSTEC, a regional group formed on India's initiative

 This was not an issue for the NCP, an ally of the UPA government

 The notice stated that the party 13
 16 karod kii aay kaa khulaasa hi nahin kiya

 to nai dilli se nahin ladengi kiran bedi
 Ever since Kiran Bedi joined BJP, journalists have been asking her about New Delhi
 kiran bedi ne bhi aupchaarik taur par haa yaa naa kahe bina is romaanch ko banaae rakhaa
 In the election, no candidate directly rejects any challenge
 isliye vah kahati rahi hai ki party jahaan se ladayegin main taiyaar hum
 BJP has decided to fight Kiran Bedi from Krishnanagar
 isi ke saath nai dilli ke liye taiyaar kiran banaam kejariwal jaisi surkhiyaan dhari kii dhari rah gayi
 Now channels and newspapers will have to rhyme different headlines for New Delhi and Krishnanagar
 nai dilli seat dilli kii raajnneeti main romaanch or junun kaa pratik ban gai he
 In the last election, everyone was shocked by the announcement that Arvind Kejriwal had challenged the veteran Sheila Dixit
 kaiyon ko laga tha ki nai dilli se shila dikshit ko haraana mushkil he
 It was a bet that established the Aam Aadmi Party as an aggressive team from the very first over of the match
 arvind kejariwal ne shila dikshit ko haraa diya
 For this reason, the media and people were also expecting a big battle this time on the New Delhi seat
 sabko lag rahaa tha ki bijepi bhi arvind ko aisi hi patkhni degi
 But even after taking a big bet to make Kiran Bedi the chief ministerial candidate, the BJP did not take any risk in the matter of contesting them
 har party ko apane hisaab se ranneeti banane kaa haq he, lekin bijepi ne kiran bedi ke liye surakshit seat chunakar yah bhi sanket diya he ki fokas chunaav jeetne par rakhaa jaae na ki koi ek seat
 Kiran Bedi will be able to campaign in the rest of Delhi due to Krishna Nagar
 purvi dilli kaa krishnanagar 1993 se bijepi ke paas he
 From here, Dr
 Harsh Vardhan has been winning
 is seat par unhen koi nahin haraa sakaa
 The BJP has never received less than fifty percent votes here except in the 2008 Legislative Assembly
 is lihaaz se yah bhaajapa kii seat he
 BJP has fielded Nupur Sharma from New Delhi
 dilli kii raajnneeti par nazar rakhane vaale or chunavi chaska lene vaale is khabar ko kai tareeke se padhenge ki bijepi arvind ke saamne kiran ko utaarne se ghabara gai yaa bijepi ko ab bhi vishwaas nahin he ki kiran se naiyya paar hogi
 Therefore, the BJP, which went to the polls in four states without a chief ministerial candidate, changed the strategy for Delhi
 pehle mukhyamantri ke sawaal par chup rahi, lekin ab bataa hi diya ki kiran hi bhaajapa kii kiran hai
 She is no longer a sister
 shaayad hamaara matadaata kisi mahila netritv main didi or maa hi dekhtaa hoga
 Then 65-year-old Kiran Bedi has been asked to call Kiran Didi
 kiran ke saamne pandrah saal chote arvind kejariwal honge
 Do not start calling him Arvind Bhaiya in front of your sister
 jo bhi ho dilli kaa chunaav bhaiyya didi kaa khel nahin rahaa
 This is an election risked to win
 amit shah ne to kah hi diya he ki dilli ek prayog he
 Here we will try our system to win and if win, BJP will continue to win for 25 years
 afsos bas itnaa he ki grih mantralay ke adheen kaam karne vaale is rajya ke chunaav main nai dilli kii seat kaa romaanch chalaa gaya
 Even after this, there is still a thrill in Delhi's election
 bas media ke camaron ko nai dilli or krishnanagar main daud lagaani hogi
 Oh yes, is interested in this question that Arvind Kejriwal should not go to Krishnanagar like last time to compete with Kiran Bedi! Do you know whether this should also be the bet of BJP? arvind kejariwal itani badi galati to nahin karenge jaise bijepi ne kiran bedi ko nai dilli na bhejkar koi galati nahin kii he

 aaj se teen saal pehle tak auskar pistorius ko duniya isi naam se jaanati thi
 Paralympic athlete, who proved to the world that steps are not needed if the intention is to leave the world behind
 lekin vah kal tha, jabaki aaj vah courtroom main sajaa se maafee yaa yah kahen ki chhot ke liye is kadar bhookha ki uskaa ahm tak ghutanon ke bal lotane par majaboor ho gaya
 At that time in the court of Priestoria, there will be hardly any person who is not afraid to see the world conqueror in a cripple-like situation
 shaayad yahi kaaran he ki jabpistorius ke vakilne apane muvakkil kii viklaangata ko chhot kaa aadhaar bataaya, to ek baargi puraa courtroom stabdh rahaa gaya
 To prove disability, Oscar had to do what he would never have imagined
 pretoria hai court ke justise ne buudhvaar ko kaha ki apnigrlfriend reva steencmpaki hatya karne ko lekar auskar pistorius ko chah july ko sajaa sunai jaaegi
 But apart from hearing, we are going to tell you 10 such things in the courtroom, which will make your eyes silent after reading
 -1) courtroom khachaa-khach bharaa hua tha
 The lawyer demanded a waiver of the punishment on disability, on which Oscar stood on his knee to move his prosthetic leg in front of the entire court room
 is dauraan pehle to vah sabase nazren mila rahe thea, lekin phir farsh ke sivaa unhone or kuch nahin dekha
 2) When the judge asked Oscar to remove the prosthetic leg, it seemed as if he had no hope of this
 vah apane aap ko apamaanit mahasoos karne lage
 However, this was the only and last resort for exemption in punishment, so he did not hesitate
 3) jaise-jaise pistorius apane kadamon ko aage badhaate courtroom main subakne kii aawaaj sunai dene lagi
 Every person he attended was shocked and shocked
 4) is puure dimonstrishan ke dauraan 29 saal ke auskar pistorius ne ek baar bhi saamne najar uthaakar nahin dekha
 Tears seeped through his eyes
 5) is kram main jab pistorius ke pairon main khinchaav bahut adhik bad gaya to unhen khadey rahane ke liye kushan diya gaya
 During this, he was crying bitterly
 unki legal team ke ek sadsy ne unhen aansu ponchney ke liye tissue diya
 6) Oscar's condition was such that he could not even wipe the tears from himself
 tab unki bahan emi or unki dost jena adkins ne aage badhkar dhants badhaayaa
 7) The action proceeded so Oscar once again wore his prosthetic legs and proceeded towards the dock
 is dauraan aage baithe kuch logon ne unka santulan banane ke liye apana haath aage kiya, lekin auskar ne manaa kar diya
 8) When Oscar Pistorius came and sat in his dock, tears were coming out of his eyes
 vah samaane lakdi kii railing ko pakadakar sir jhukaakar baithe rahe
 9) Oscar told the court that he has discomfort while walking with artificial legs and running blades
 10) jab tak karrwai khatm hui auskar pistorius kaa cheharaa puri tarah laal ho chukaa tha
 He was so overwhelmed in the sense of humiliation and shame that he did not look at anyone while coming out of the courtroom
 is dauraan unke bhai karl ne unka sahyog kiya
 First beaten with a bat, then fired, Oscar is reported to have shot and killed Reva in his home in 2013 on Valentine's Day (february 14)
 auskar court main yah rat lagaate rahe he ki unhone andhere main ghar main chor daakhil hone ke shaq main goli chalaai thi
 But forensic reports said that Oscar had beaten Reva with a bat before being shot
 auskar ko kam se kam 15 saal kii sajaa ho sakati he
 But due to mental illness and lack of both legs, Oscar's lawyers are demanding a lesser sentence

 philhal dilli sarkaar main mantri kapil mishra ne GM bijon ko lekar modi sarkaar or baba ramdev ko gheraa he
 At the beginning of the blog 'the last few breaths of the country's mustard', Kapil Mishra wrote that 'the last few breaths of the country's mustard are left
 GM beej krishi se lekar kisaan, swasthya or paryaavaran ke liye khatra he
 After all, that is going to be what i was afraid of

 "cheating with farmers and Bharat Mata", though Kapil in his blog, don't forget to do politics on Punjab
 unhone likhaa ki 'punjab jo ki apni lahalhati sarson ke liye duniya bhar main janaa jaataa he, us punjab kii pahchaan par ye sidhaa hamalaa he
 There is still time, the Modi government will have to understand that there is no end to greed, our farmers, our fields, our Ayurveda will all come to an end, so these few seed making companies will not come to save
 GM bijon ko is tarah khaadya fasalon main laana desh ke saath, kisaanon ke saath, bharat mata ke saath dhokhaa he
 In the blog "everyone knows what fear is silent", many questions have been raised on Baba Ramdev and Sri Sri
 kapil ne likhaa he ki 'dukh sabase bada ye ki barason tak in kisaanon ke dushmano se janata ke saath milakar ladane vaale sab aaj na jane kis dar se chuppi lagaakar baith gaye hai
 The Sangh is silent, the indigenous people are silent, Ramdev ji is silent, Shri Sri is silent, all those BJP leaders and workers who were fighting against these seeds and companies on the streets are silent
 par yaad rakhana, ye desh nahin chup baithegaa
 Neither will you sit silent nor forgive me

 ek puraani kahawat he ki ishk andhaa hota he
 And the new truth is that in Ishq people also become blind
 agar yah sach nahin hota to ek shaks ko uski bivi or maa-baap jarur dikhaai dete
 But in blind love, that person was so blind that he could not see any other relationship other than his beloved
 jaahir he aise haalat main anjaam bhayanak hi hona tha
 And the same thing happened
 khooni ishk, pyaasa khanjarek aisa aashiq jo apni mashooq ke paas pahunchane se sirf ghanta bhar pehle ek ghar main tha
 And three more people were inside the house
 haath main khanjar liye ye aashiq sabase pehle us kamare main pahunchaa jahaan 24 saal kii ek mahila akeli thi
 After entering the room, in the blink of an eye, he removed the dagger into the woman's body
 or ye tha uskaa pehla shikaar
 Now his steps move towards another room
 vahaan ek umrdaraj shaks maujuud tha
 The dagger once again waved in the air and went straight into the person's chest and sunk
 ye tha uskaa doosraa shikaar
 When a woman entered the room after hearing the cry, the blood-thirsty dagger found her third victim
 or khanjar phir us aurat ke jism ke aar paar ho gaya
 He himself was injured for one night, one house, one killer, less than an hour and three dead bodies
 katl ke baad kaatil sidhe ghar se baahar gaya
 a little nervous, a little nervous
 usne motorcycle uthaai or vahaan se chal padaa
 Before he could get far away from the chance-a-case, the bike balance suddenly deteriorated
 or khud kaatil ab jameen par padaa tha
 He was groaning with injury
 or phir isi alam main usne apni jeb se mobile nikaala or kisi ko kol kiya
 After talking for a few seconds, he disconnected the phone
 achaanak uske chehre par ek khoonkhaar hansi tairne lagi
 He himself ended his family, the name of the person who murdered three-three with his hands was Nitin Verma
 dilli ke dwarka ilaake main rahane vaale nitin ne jin logon kaa katl kiya tha, usamen pehla shikaar koi or nahin balki uski apni bivi puja thi
 The second person he killed was his own father
 or teesri baar jiske kaleje main usne khanjar utaara tha wo koi or nahin nitin kii maa thi
 This was Nitin's small family
 jise khud nitin ne apane haathon se khatm kar diya tha
 Read here: For three years, this man, who was dancing on his wife's grave, made Nitin the devil, why was Nitin so happy after killing his parents and wife? The answer was his love, Ragini
 ji haa, muhabbat
 The love in which Nitin's family came in the way
 or unke jite ji nitin ko uski manzil milanaa mushkil tha
 So he killed his entire family
 darasal puja nitin kaa pehla pyaar thi
 Which he named the relationship after the consent of the family
 lekin shaadi ke chand maheene hi guzare the ki nitin kii mulaakaat pados main rahane vaali raagini se ho gai
 And it was from here that the story ended with the death of three people
 ishk main andhaa ho chukaa tha nitinraagini puja ke mukaable na sirf zyaada khubasurat thi, balki vah pehali hi nazar main nitin ko apana dil bhi de baithi thi
 Gradually the two grew closer and then the friendship turned into love
 idhar raagini lagaataar nitin ke nazadik aa rahi thi
 And there Pooja was getting away from him
 nitin or raagini kaa pyaar har guzarate din ke saath yun hi paravaan chadhataa ja rahaa tha
 This silsilas of love started secretly, now it was beginning to openly
 or ek din nitin ke is pyaar kii puri kahani uski bivi puja ko pataa chal gai
 Poojasach was surprised to know the truth and the ground slipped under the feet of Pooja
 iske baad donon ke bich kai baar takaraar hui
 Pooja kept trying to convince Nitin many times
 lekin har koshish bekaar sabit hui
 Troubled, Pooja got fed up and told her parents the whole story of Nitin and Ragini's love
 maa-baap bhi use samajhane lage the
 But the constant interruptions of wife and parents slowly started hurting Nitin
 use raagini ke khilaaf bolne vaala har shaks apana dushman najar aane laga
 So instead of getting away from Ragini, she decided to marry Ragini
 akele hi rachi thi khooni sajishanitin ko maaloom tha ki bivi or maa-baap ke rahete uskaa sapana sach hona mumkin nahin tha
 So he hatched a conspiracy
 ek aisi sajeesh jise sun kar bade se bada shaatir dimaag shaitan bhi sharma jaae
 On April 19, 2008, Nitin entered his house secretly with a dagger before he went straight to his room and removed the dagger in his wife Pooja's body
 uske baad usne apane pita vinod sharma ko maut kii neend sula diya
 And as soon as Nitin's mother Pushpa entered the room, she also dashed the same thing in her mother's chest
 zarur padhentandoorkand: khaufnak hatya kii sajeesh kii dardanaak daastansajeesh kaa hissaa tha accidentsajeesh kaa pehla charan ab puraa ho chukaa tha
 But the real planning was yet to be done
 apni bivi or maa-baap ke koon ke chhinte uske daaman par naa lagen iske liye usne ek chaal chali
 He pretended to be his accident with a motorcycle
 khud apane chachaa ko phone kar accident kii khabar di
 He told uncle that despite constantly calling home, no one is picking up the phone, so he should go home and report the accident himself
 uski chaal kaam kar gai
 When his uncle reached home, he was shocked to see three dead bodies there
 udhar accident kaa naatak kar nitin paas ke ek nursing home main kuch der ke liye bhartee ho gaya
 Nitinpolis started the investigation under suspicion
 ghar main lutpaat kii koshish ke koi nishaan nahin mili
 All three murders were done in the same manner
 lihaaja police kaa chaunkna bhi lazimi tha
 But whose whole family's blood was shed
 vah khud seen se gaayab tha
 And this inadvertently gave a new direction to the investigation of the police
 jaanch aage badhaane ke liye police ko ummid kii ek hi kiran najar aa rahi thi or wo tha khud nitin
 At the time of the murder, the police was knocking somewhere about his accident
 lihaaja andhere me tir maarthe hue police ne nitin par apni ankhen gada deen
 Must Read: The story of Bhanwari Devi caught in the whirlpool of politics, CD and affair was strictly uncovered
 On 24 April 2008, police questioned Nitin
 katl ke roj nitin kab kahaan kya kar rahaa tha, police ne uski puri chaanbin kii
 It was also investigated how long before the murder, he spoke to the family for the last time
 Initially, Nitin tried to mislead the police
 lekin uske har jawaab main jhooth jhalak rahaa tha
 So, when the police now started to unravel the truth in their own way, the secret was revealed
 thodi si sakhti ke aage nitin kaa fareb haar gaya
 As soon as iqbal-e-jurm was arrested, the police arrested him
 qatl kii is saazish se raagini kaa koi lenaa-dena nahin tha, lihaaza kanoonee karrwai ke daayre ke saath-saath ab raagini nitin kii zindagi se dur ho gai
 He was sentenced to death by the court
 baad main uski sajaa umrakaid main badal di gai

 In Delhi, the news of 'aaj Tak' against the tanker mafia who illegally dug borewells and supplied water got the effect
 dilli ke fatehpur beri ilaake main avaidh tareeke se chal rahi koi borwell ko sil kar diya gaya he
 Let us tell you that during the capture of these tanker mafias in the Fatehpur Beri area black camera, Aaj Tak's journalist was also attacked and misbehaved
 lekin ajtak kii khabar kaa hi asar rahaa ki SDM ne ilaake main chal rahe avaidh borwell ke khilaaf sakht kadam uthaaya he

 Notices have also been issued to their owners
 police kii red main kai gharon ke andar avaidh tareeke se chal rahe borwell bhi sil kiye gaye hai
 Along with this, orders have also been given to investigate the ongoing mafiagiri for supplying water through this tanker
 saket ke SDM ne 'ajtak' kii khabar ko sangyaan lete hue is kaarywahi ko anjaam diya
 During the police raid it was also revealed that the sealed borewells were not only illegal, but also the electricity connection taken to run them also became illegal
 2 aaropee ho chuke hai giraftaaraisase pehle ajtak kii khabar kaa sangyaan lete hue police ne do aropiyon ko giraftaar kar liya tha
 However, Delhi Police's Special Commissioner Deepender Pathak continued to deny illegal borewells in the farmhouses
 itnaa hi nahin dilli kiaam aadmi partiki sarkaar bhi police se kai baar in tanker mafiaon kii avaidh gatividhiyon kii shikaayat kar chuki he

 uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath dwaara shwet patr laane kii baat par bahujan samaajawaadee party kii supremeo mayawati bhadak gai hai
 Mayawati says that the Yogi government should bring a white paper on the lack of its government
 mayawati kaa kahana he ki shwet patr jari karne kii baat karke vah pichley sarkaar ko gherne kii aad main apni kamiyon ko chupaane kaa prayaas kar rahe hai
 Mayawati said that the issue of the white paper proves how small the Yogi government's thinking is and it is trying to cover its shortcomings by gaining cheap popularity
 mayawatine kaha ki behatar hota agar yogi sarkaar vipakshiyon kii kami kii jagah apni kamiyon ko lekar shwet patr jari karti
 He said that the Yogi government has, in fact, issued a white paper and tried to sow the opposite Ganges
 mayawati ne ek bayaan jari kar kaha ki yogi ke netritv valibijepisarkaar asal main centre kii modi sarkaar kii tarah hi janhit, janakalyaan, vikaas or kanoon-vyavastha ke maamle main vifal or phiseddi rahi he
 Talking about development is just an excuse to deceive the poor, unemployed youth and toiling masses
 sa maamle main sarkaar kii niyat sahi or eemaandaar hoti to pradesh kii sadaken gaddha mukt ho gai hoti
 Innocent children of poor do not die in hospitals
 unhone kaha ki bhaajapa kii sarkarein vipakshi partiyaan or purvavarti sarkaron ko nishaanaa banane kaa prayaas karti rahati hai, taaki logon kii ankhon main dhul jhonkkar apni kamiyon par se dhyaan bhatka sake
 The Yogi government should also tell the public that for how many more months, they will continue to accuse previous governments for exposing their government's shortcomings
 ek bayaan main mayawati ne aarope lagaaya ki is sarkaar main har str par bhrashtachar vyaapt he
 There is no such thing as governance in the state
 bijli ke liye pradesh bhar main haahaakaar machaa hua he
 People have to migrate due to unemployment
 mayawati kaa kahana he ki kisaanon ko karj maafee ke naam par unako 10, 25 rupee or 100 rupye kaa check dekar rin maafee kaa dhindhora peeta ja rahaa he
 No one can trust the words of such a government that betrays the public
 mayawati ne pradesh kii kanoon vyavastha par sawaal uthaate hue kaha ki aparaadh or kanoon vyavastha kii sthiti bahut kharaab he
 The statistics which Yogi Adityanath is giving about crime and law and order is absolutely wrong
 shwetapatr par mayawati ne kaha ki yah dusron ko bura bataakar khud ko acha sabit karne kii koshish he
 The Supreme Court, while giving importance to religious traditions, clarified that Darul qaza-darul Ifta would not be banned, but they would not have the right to violate a person's constitutional rights
 sarvocch adaalat ne apane santulit faisle main saaf kar diya ki sharai adaalaton kaa koi kanoonee aadhaar nahin he
 He also advised them to refrain from interfering in the constitutional rights of Muslims until someone asks them to
 yah faisla teen vajahon se behad mahatvapurn he: desh kii kisi bhi kanoonee adaalat ke saamne fatve kii koi ahmiyat nahin he
 Second, the Sharai courts should not interfere in cases in which no help has been sought from them
 teesraa, daarul iftaa aise fatve na jari karen, jinase kisi vyakti ke moulik adhikaron or aazaadee kaa ulanghan hota he
 The Supreme Court had to clear two things: One, do Shari courts like Darul Kaza run parallel justice systems like the Indian justice system and get their verdicts implemented? Secondly, do the Sharia courts and Darul Ifta's fatwas have any legal recognition? ke
 The bench of Prasad and Pinaki Chandra Ghosh have also made it clear that Darul Ifta has the right to 'fatwa in the light of the Quran and Hadith, but Shari courts like Darul Kaja, who pronounce the verdict according to these Fatwas, forcefully enforce their decision Can not get it done
 peeth ne yah bhi saaf kar diya ki sharai adaalatein bhartiya nyaay vyavastha kii tarah koi samanaantar nyaay pranali nahin chalaatin
 Balanced decision Bench said in its judgment, "the order of the institution established through law is binding and consequences are incurred if it is not followed
" sharai adaalat (daarul kaja yaa kaaji court) aisi sansthaaen nahin hai
 Darul Kaja is neither formed by law nor is he legally recognized by the competent legislature
 mughal or british shashan ke dauraan inkaa koi bhi darja rahaa hoga, lekin swatantra bharat kii sanvaidhanik vyavastha main inaki koi jagah nahin he
 "they neither have legal recognition nor can their orders and edicts be enforced through legal process
 yadi koi inhen jabardastee lagu karne kii koshish karata he to aisa karnaa gaiyrkanoonee hoga
 Darul Kaja cannot be called a parallel judicial system
 imrana maamle ko maddenjar rakhte hue peeth ne kaha ki daarul iftaa or daarul kaja ko is bare main satark rahanaa chahie ki vivaad se anjaan yaa bahari vyakti ke kehane par aise maamle main fatwa na den, jahaan vivaad do logon ke bich ho
 The court has said that anyone can take a fatwa on the issue related to the entire community, but the couple should give a fatwa only on issues related to the particular issue if either of the two parties offer it
 peeth ne kaha ki fatvon ko adaalat main chunauti dene kii jarurat nahin he
 They should be ignored
 agar koi unhen lagu karne kii koshish karata he to yah gaiyrkanoonee hoga
 Fatwa does not have any legal recognition, but it has such an effect that it can bring ruin, so those who give fatwa should take great precaution
 court ne salaah di ki koi sharai adaalat kisi bhi shaks ke bare main koi aisa fatwa yaa faisla na de, jisase us shaks ke maanavadhikaron kaa hanan hota ho
 Fatwas affecting legal rights, status and moral duties are completely unlawful
 musalamaanon kii pratikriyafatve or sharai adaalaton ke faisle ko maanane kii baadhyataa ke bare main desh ke muslim buddhijiviyon main kisi tarah kaa bhram nahin tha
 Therefore, almost all the people welcomed the decision of the Supreme Court
 purv kendriya mantri aarif mohammad khan kaa kahana he ki adaalat kaa faisla kisi bhi tarah se hakeekat ke ulat nahin he
 But they say that a section of the Mullah-clerics has become a cause of trouble for the Muslim community and they are violating the human rights of the people
 unhone kaha, ''yah shoshan ke alaava or kuch nahin he
 Maulana Arshad Madani, president of Jamiat Ulema-e Hind, an organization associated with the movement for independence of the country and opposing the concept of Pakistan, calls this PIL a conspiracy
 unke mutabik, ''yah sharai adaalat gathit karne or fatve dene ke hamaare haq ke khilaaf ek sajeesh thi, jise supreme court ne khaarij kar diya he
 In the light of the Shari'a, issues are resolved through fatwas
 use koi maane yaa na maane, koi jabardastee nahin he

 of the Executive Council of All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB)"
 kyuu
 R
 eliyas kehete hai, ''is baat ko lekar kabhi koi andeh nahin tha ki ham koi paralal jeudiciri chalaate hai or na hi sharai adaalaton ko koi kanoonee manyata hasil thi
 The court has also made this point clear and has appreciated the role of Sharia courts in the society
 sharai adaalaton kii vajah se lakhon maamle court main nahin pahunchate varanaa court main lambit maamalon kii sankhya or bhi bad jaati
 "although AIMPLB, like Ilyas, believes that the burden of litigation from courts is reduced through Darul Kaja, according to a 2006 study, only 6,433 lawsuits have been settled in the board's 22 Shariah courts across the country since 1973
 janhit yachikapeshey se vakil vishwa lochan madan ne 2005 main janhit yachika daayar kar sharai adaalaton kii sanvaidhanik vaidhata par sawaal uthaaya tha
 The petition demanded the closure of these courts
 madan ke mutabik, ''daarul iftaa kisi ke bhi kehane par har choti-badi baat par fatve jari kar detaa he or aise fatve logon ke maanavadhikaron main dakhal karte hai
 Madan was keeping the case alive in the court for the last nine years
 lekin unhone faisle kaa swaagat kiya or mana ki court ne sharai adaalat par roak na lagaakar acha hi kiya he
 He said, "the court did not accept all my sayings, but cleared a doubt that the Shariah courts do not have any legal recognition and they cannot forcefully execute their verdict
" 
 
 agar meri baat maan lee jaati to shaayad thik nahin hota
 "the board and the government's sideboard argued that Darul Qaza should be retained in the entire case
 court main board ne paksh rakhaa tha ki fatwa badhyakaari nahin hota or yah mufti kaa vichaar / salaah yaa mahaj madhyasthikaran hota he, jo tabhi diya jaataa he jab koi paksh uske paas aata he
 He has no authority or authority to enforce it
 agar kisi fatve ko us vyakti kii marji ke khilaaf lagu karaane kii koshish kii jaati he to vah uske khilaaf adaalat kaa darwaja khatkhata saktaa he
 The Government of India made its stand during the hearing in the Supreme Court that the fatwas are only opinions and no Muslim is obliged to obey them
 duusari taraf daarul kaja jaisi sharai adaalatein dand samhita ke tahat apane faisle lagu nahin karwaatin, balki muslim pariwaron se jude maamalon masalan shaadi-byaah, talaak vagairah main mahaj madhyasth yaa salaahkaar kii bhoomika nibhaati hai
 The government supported the Shariah courts, saying that this is just an alternative system to settle family disputes outside Indian courts, where disputes are settled at a lower cost and quickly
 sarkaar ne kaha ki sharai adaalatein koi samanaantar kanoon pranali nahin chalaatin or is asardaar vyavastha ko khatm nahin kiya ja saktaa
 According to Darul Ifta and Darul Qajaparsanal Law Board member Mufti Ejaz Kasami, "darul Ifta gives his opinion on Sharia's view on matters related to marriage, marriage, divorce or Islam, which is called fatwa
 jabaki, daarul kaja un fatvon ke mutabik chalane vaali adaalaton ko kehete hai, jiske jaj ko kaaji kehete hai
 "in Darul Kaja, if any person brings a case, then the other party is asked to respond by giving due notice
 donon hi paksh apni daleelon ke liye kisi bhi mufti kii madad le sakate hai
 After hearing the answers from both sides, the Qazi gives its verdict according to the Islamic Sharia
 muslim personal lau board deshbhar main sharai adaalaton kaa gathan karata he
 Another aspect of fatwa, according to AIMPLB member Mufti Ejaz Kasami, 'fatwas are mostly maligned
 ’ achche fatvon ko kam ujagar kiya jaataa he
 There are many examples where the edicts issued by Darul Ifta have been appreciated not only nationally but internationally
 ve bataate hai ki 2005 main daarul ulum, devband ne ek fatwa diya, jiske mutabik bakreed main gaay kii qurbaani ko ye kehete hue galat bataaya ki agar kisi dharm ke maanane waalon ko gaay kii qurbaani se thes pahunchati ho to aise jaanavar kii qurbaani thik nahin
 This fatwa was appreciated all over the country
 isi tarah aatankwaad ke khilaaf daarul ulum, devband ke fatve kii puri duniya main saraahna hui
 According to that fatwa, terrorism and violence are forbidden in Islam and martyr status cannot be given to those involved in such work
 is fatve ko na sirf desh kii sansad balki america or yuan main bhi saraahaa gaya
 In such cases, the Muslim Personal Law Board has to take care that justice is done to all persons and their civil rights are not violated

 According to police, there are no CCTV cameras around the scene

 Police suspect that both these cars were racing during the accident
 police abhi aropiyon kii talash kar rahi he
 a student of class 8, gang-rape victim in a village in Ramala police station area of uttar Pradesh's Baghpat district, committed suicide by hanging herself after being threatened by the accused for looting her honor
 shuruyaat main is maamle ko grih-kalah ke kaaran khudakushi bataane vaali police ne maamla tool pakadta dekh 5 aropiyon ko giraftaar kar jaanch shuru kar di he
 Baghpat Superintendent of Police Jaiprakash suspended Sharad Tilara, the crime branch in-charge and the then in-charge of Ramala police station, for negligence in the incident
 aaropee sonu, monu, rohit, sagar or pappu ko giraftaar kar unke khilaaf mukadmaa darj kar liya gaya he
 The court has ordered the five to be sent to jail

 The girl's mother said that her daughter, an 8th grade student at a school in the village, had gone to a nearby shop to fetch goods about four months ago

 But the police did not take any action despite receiving nominated complaint

 On the other hand, the family claims that the medical report confirmed the gang rape
 kishori ke bayaan bhi darj hue the
 Despite this, the police gave a clean chit to the accused by putting a final report in the case

 pradhanmantri narendra modi ke banaras se chunaav namakan ko aitihaasik banane kii taiyaari jor-shor ke shuru ho gai he
 Like the last time, the party wants to create such a person who can give a big message
 sutron ke mutabik is baar kisi chaukeedaar ko narendra modi kaa chunavi prastaavak banaaya ja saktaa he
 Let me tell you that in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, 4 celebrities were included in Varanasi seat as Narendra Modi's election proponent
 inamen mashhoor shastreey gayak channulaal mishra kaa naam khaas taur se liya ja rahaa he
 Also included were Giridhar Malaviya, Sailor Bhadra Prasad Nishad and weaver Ashok Kumar
 haalanki pehle shehanai vadak bismillah khan ke bete ko modi kaa prastaavak banane kaa ofer diya gaya tha, lekin wo raji nahin hue the
 The party is also planning to include a watchman as a proponent for Narendra Modi's nomination in this Lok Sabha election
 bijepi is daanv se congress ko karaara jawaab dena chaahati he
 That is why the BJP is looking for a watchman living in Varanasi, who is of a clean image and there should not be any allegations against him
 darasal congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi or unki party rafel ke mudde par 'chaukeedaar chor' sambodhan ke saath narendra modi ko gherne kii kavayad kar rahe hai
 This attack of the opposition was included in the bjp's election campaign
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne video ke saath apane twit main kaha tha ki aapkaa yah chaukeedaar raashtra kii seva main majbootee se khadaa he, lekin main akelaa nahin hum'
 Everyone who is fighting corruption, filth, social evils is a watchman
 har koi jo bharat kii pragati ke liye kathin parishram kar rahaa he, vah ek chaukeedaar he
 Today every Indian is saying that i too the watchman
 bijepi ab piem ke chunavi prastaavak ke taur par chaukeedaar ko bananaa chaahati he taaki is abhiyaan ko or bhi dhar diya ja sake
 At the same time, there is an exercise to make Narendra Modi's nomination historic
 isaki rup rekha bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne banaai he
 Shah recently spent two days visiting and churning with party leaders
 pradhanmantri narendra modi 26 april ko namakan karenge
 The PM will also conduct a road show in Benares on 25 April, a day before his nomination
 modi banaras ke lanka sthit malviya pratimaa ko maalyarpan karne ke baad road sho shuru karenge or ye road sho goduliya par jaakar khatm hoga
 After this, PM Modi will visit the Ganga Aarti after visiting the Kashi Vishwanath temple
 namakan juluus maladahia sthit sardaar vallabh bhai patel kii pratimaa ko naman kar nikalegaa jo kachhari par jaakar khatm hoga
 Amit Shah has appealed to the workers to make PM Modi's nomination program historic and said that every officer should give time at his booth
 namakan main kareeb 5 lakh logon ke shaamil hone kaa daawa kiya ja rahaa he
 The bjp's well thought out strategy is to make pm's nomination historic
 namakan se aisa maahaul banane kii he jisase purvanchal se lekar bihar tak ko saadhaa ja sake
 In the last Lok Sabha elections, the BJP had created a similar atmosphere, as a result of which the BJP was successful in winning all the seats except Azamgarh in Purvanchal
 ek baar phir usee formule ke tahat bijepi ranneeti bana rahi he
 Every news of the election will be received directly in your inbox
 aam chunaav kii tazaa khabaron se apadet rahane ke liesbscribakaren ajtak kaa ellection special newzlator BJP national president Amit Shah has termed the merger of the Janata Parivar as 'immoral'
 shah nagediu-argedy-congressgathabandhan ko apavitra or aniatik gathbandhan bataate hue shanivaar ko kaha ki jis tarah kaa apavitra gathbandhan bihar main aakaar lene ja rahaa he, use dekhte hue unhen vishwaas he ki bihar kii janata inaki ekta se koi ittfa nahin rakhegi
 In the coming days, a BJP government will be formed in Bihar with an absolute majority
 patna main bijepi ke pradesh karyaalay main patrakaron ko sambodhit karte hue shah ne puraane janata parivaar ke dalon ke vilay ke bare main kaha ki jahaan tak janata parivaar ke ek hone kaa sawaal he, bijepi isse katai chintit nahin he
 Because the public has left the family and only the 'family' has survived
 vah chunaav main kuch pradarshan nahin kar paaegaa
 In the presence of senior BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi, Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad and party state president Mangal Pandey, Amit Shah said that Lalu Prasad and Nitish Kumar always did politics against Congress and Nitish did politics against Lalu for 17 years
 
 ab ve ek hokar chunaav ladanaa chaahate hai, jo ek ‘apavitra’ gathbandhan he jise aap ‘aniatik’ bhi kah sakate hai
 Asked if the Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi is removed from the post by the Nitish camp, will the BJP support him and be included in the party, Shah said, adding that his party would consider it in the event of a situation
 bihar main samay se pehle chunaav karaae jane ke bare main puche jane par shah ne kaha ki ham kabhi bhi samay se pehle chunaav nahin chaahate
 The BJP believes that every government should complete its democratic term
 ham kabhi asthirataa main vishwaas nahin rakhte
 Amit Shah exuded confidence that the BJP government will form here with more than 185 seats in the 243-member Bihar Assembly in the coming days and his party will give a good and strong government and liberate the state from the return of 'jungle Raj'
 
 yah puche jane par ki kya pradesh main party ke varisht netaa susheel kumaar modi ko aage kar bijepi aane vaala bihar vidhansabha chunaav ladegi, shah ne kaha ki mukhyamantri kaa ummidavaar koun hoga, is bare main bijepi sansadeey board nirnay karegaa
 There is no talk about it yet
 mukhyamantri ke ummidavaar ke taur par kisi ko pesh kiya jayega yaa nahin, is bare main kuch bhi tay nahin hua he
 When asked about Prime Minister Narendra Modi's promise to give special status to Bihar when his government was formed at the Center at the time of Lok Sabha elections, Shah said that everything will be given to Bihar if a good government is formed in this state
 
 narendra modi sarkaar paanch saal ke liye he, na ki kuch maheenon ke liye
 He said that not only the development of Bihar, but the development of the entire eastern India is on the priority agenda of the Modi government
 shah ne kaha ki pradhanmantri narendra modi dwaara kiye gaye vaade ke anusaar bihar ko uskaa haq milegaa
 When asked about the grant of special state status to Bihar, he said that he had said what he had to say

 chennai main hui baari barishke kaaran puraa shahar dub rahaa he
 Roads, bridges, runways, railway tracks are all submerged in flood waters

 For this, the land was encircled
 naaliyon-talabon kaa pani roka gaya
 The result was that water could not find a proper exit route
 lagaataar barish ne sthiti bhayaavah kar di or phir jo hua or ho rahaa he vah sabake saamne he
 According to one figure, more than 300 reservoirs disappeared somewhere in this race of development

 The El nino-indian Meteorological Department says that El Nino is a major reason behind this change of weather
 haalanki adhikari yah bhi maanate hai ki jaisi barish ho rahi he vah saamaanya nahin he or isse andaja lagaaya ja rahaa he ki 2015-16 kaa al nino sabase taqatvar hone vaala he

 The Congress seems to have got a revival in Himachal Pradesh
 pradesh main congress abhi tak mukhyamantri virbhadra singh ke agle vidhansabha chunaav se ''baahar rahane" kii dhamkee or chunaav abhiyaan ko kuch netaaon kii samiti ke samuhik netritv main chalaae jane kii baagiyon kii khulkar maang ke bich jujh rahi thi
 Finally, Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi broke it to an election rally in Mandi on 7 October and created a happy atmosphere in the party, declaring, "virbhadra Singh ji, you have been Chief Minister for six times
 aap saatvin baar bhi mukhyamantri banenge or puri congress aapke saath khadi he
 "announcing the name of Virbhadra as the face of the Chief Minister of Congress again may make it difficult for the BJP
 netritv ke masale ko hal karne ke alaava ahm yah bhi he ki congress ke vibhajit dhade chunaav ke pehle ek saath ho gaye hai
 At the Mandi rally, apart from state unit chief Sukhwinder Sukku (virbhadra's most outspoken critic in the Himachal Congress), various leaders including former Union Minister Anand Sharma appeared with the Chief Minister
 duusari ore bhaajapa abhi tak apane mukhyamantri chehre kii ghoshnaa nahin kar pai he
 The picture is not clear among voters and party workers whether the face of the party will be former CM Prem Kumar Dhumal or Union Minister Jagat Prakash Nadda
 yah atakalein bhi hai ki party amit shah kisi nae chehre se chaunkaa sakate hai
 Congress leader Harsh Mahajan, close to Virbhadra, says, "now we have taken the lead
" yah samay par liya gaya acha faisla he
 In Punjab, just as the name of Captain Amarinder Singh was announced, here too Rahul Gandhi has removed any confusion among the voters
 " mandi kii jansabha main rahul ne himachal main congress or gujarat main bhaajapa sarkaar kii uplabdhiyon kaa tulanaatmak chart bhi padhaa
 He said, "in Himachal, 70,000 new jobs were created in the government sector, whereas in Gujarat only 10,000
 himachal main berozegaron ko 1,000 rupye kaa bhatta diya ja rahaa he, jabaki gujarat main aisa koi praavdhaan nahin he
 "many analysts believe that 83-year-old Virbhadra Singh is hoping to become the chief minister for the seventh time, given the good progress in the fields of infrastructure, education, health and employment generation
 congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi par vyangy karti hui ek nai website bani he pappupedia dot com

 sansad ke central haul main aajkal hyderaabadi biryani kii khaasi charchaa main he
 The reason is that it has just been included in the menu of Parliament
 is baar sansad kii food samiti main telugana ke saansad bhi hai jinhone manu main hyderaabadi biryani ke alaava mithe main khubaani kaa meetha or shahi tukdaa bhi shaamil karavaaya he
 The consumption of Hyderabadi biryani is more than 150 plates daily and the price is Rs 50, the amount of biryani is also fine, with salmon also available, but the sweet of apricot is also available for Rs 75
 ab wo din bhul jaaie jab sansad bhawan main 13 rou main veg thali mil jaati thi
 We did a good story so often on the cheap canteen of Parliament
 lagata he ki usee kii vajah se saansadon ke saste khaane ke achche din chale gaye
 It is still available at a lower price than the market
 nae niyam ke anusaar chammach chhuri or kaante ek kaagaj ke lipaphe main diya jaataa he
 But this is not the real story
 sansad main paanch jagah cantin he, jisamen central haul bhi shaamil he
 But food cooks only in two places
 ek rishepson kii cantin main or duusare sansad kii librari cantin main
 Meira Kumar, the Speaker of the last Lok Sabha, had formed a committee which said in its report that cooking inside the Parliament House is not safe
 aap bhi soch rahe honge ki yah vishalkay sansad loksabhaa or rajyasabha kii kaarywahi ke liye bhi surakshit he yaa nahin
 Yes, there was a debate on this during the last Lok Sabha Speaker that now a new parliament needs to be formed
 wo bahes bich main hi khatm ho gai
 All of this led to the stoppage of food inside the Parliament
 ab khaanaa sansad kii librari main banataa he
 That too from 6 in the morning
 staff paanch baje se aane lagate hai
 Breakfast prepared inside the Parliament House is brought before 9 pm
 lunch 11 baje tak aa jaataa he jo 3 baje tak parosa jaataa he
 Here food is reheated in the microwave
 ab samasya he ki baratan kaise dhoyaa jaae kyonki andar baratan dhone kii koi vyavastha nahin he
 These utensils remain there as long as the sitting of the House goes on
 sadan kii baithak yadi shaam 6 baje khatm hui tabhi ye baratan baahar dhulane jate hai
 You may wonder what happens to the staff
 philhal sansad ke central haal main hyderaabadi biryani kaa jalawaa kaayam hone laga he
 Last week, the CPM MP wrote a letter to the Minister of Human Resources saying that carnivore has been stopped in IIT Delhi

" And it will not be tolerated in the UK
 ham ummid karte hai ki yah vyavastha pratirohak kaa kaam karegi

 desh main bainkon dwaara graahakon ko di ja rahi muft sevaayen jaise atm, check book yaa statement ityadi par jiesti (guds and services tex) nahin lagegaa
 This information has been released by the Central Board of Direct Taxes and Custom as a question and answer
 haalanki tex vibhaag ne kaha he ki credit card ke bakaae kaa let pement karnaa athwa iemai bhugtan karne main vifal hone par bank jiesti vasuulenge
 Apart from this, GST will be levied on all services offered in addition to free service
 kehane kaa arth ye he ki agar atm se free nikasi kii limit samaapt hone ke baad koi nikasi kii jaati he to usapar jiesti lagegaa
 Significantly, the controversy over GST on banking facility came to light when two departments of the Ministry of Finance, Department of Financial Services and Department of Revenue, got a different opinion about the imposition of GST on free services
 iske baad central board of indiarect taxej or custom ne baqayada sawaal-jawaab jari karte hue bainkon or graahakon ke liye maamle ko puri tarah spasht karne kii koshish kii he
 Read this: Credit card bill filled with delay, now it will be more clear that after cleaning the chargetax department, it is clear that customers will not be levied any GST on 3-5 ATM withdrawals given free of cost by banks every month
 
 lekin is muft nikasi se itar hone vaali nikasi tex ke daayre main rahegi
 Similarly, GST will not be levied on the free checkbook or free balance statement received from the bank
 lekin free suvidha se itar bank charge dete hue checkbuk or statement praapt karne par jiesti dey hoga
 Read this: Modi government will keep an eye on social media posts and emails, according to the question answer of the teamtax department, if the bank gives a discount on the service charge to its customers for any service, then in such a situation from the total service charge GST will be charged only after deducting the discount
 is faisle ke chalate bank dwaara customer care, branch visit, bank draft, mobile banking, internet banking ityadi sevaaon ke liye jiesti dey hoga
 It is worth noting that banks charge different rates to their customers
 aamtaur par bank mahatvapurn graahakon ko adhik discount dete hai jisase unka khaataa bank ke saath lagaataar chalata rahe
 Now GST will also keep an eye on such accounts

 Meanwhile, another Bollywood spice film 'de De Pyaar De' has been released at the box office
 is multistarar film ke trailor kii kaaphi tarif hui thi
 Aakiv Ali has directed the film adorned with stars like Ajay devgan-tabu-rakul Preet Singh
 kahani-production lav ranjan kaa he
 Read what is special in this film and why you can see it
 
 
 kahani kya he
 
 
 The story of the film is quite simple
 jisaki shuruyaat landan se hoti he
 Ashish (ajay Devgan), a 50-year-old businessman who lives separately from the family, meets Ayesha (rakul Preet Singh), a 26-year-old girl
 ek gaanaa aata he or donon ke bich nazdikiyaan badhati hai, baat aage badi to pyaar ho gaya
 Ashish felt that if he meets Ayesha with his family, he comes to India
 vahaan par apni patni manju (tabboo), betaa-beti-mata-pita se milwataa he
 Manju and Ayesha get into a tizzy, their daughter gets angry after seeing Ashish and their relationship is in danger
 ashish rishta judwa detaa he, itani der main aaysha landan chali jaati he
 Everything starts happening between Manju and Ashish
 lekin ashish kaa dil abhi bhi aaysha ke saath he or phir beti kii shaadi ke dauraan ashish-aaysha ek ho jate hai
 Manju is different
 kyon film dekhnaa chahenge?ab mudde par aate hai ki film kyon dekhni chahie
 Actually, this film will connect you with today's modern era, where there is no age bond between love, there is no bond of relationships
 har koi khule taur par apni zindagi ji rahaa he
 That is, we are explaining something about the depths of relationships
 is bich film kamedi kaa tadakaa to he hi, trailor ke andar jo aapako dialog dikhe the uske alaava bhi kai aise seen or dialog hai jo aapako hansane ko majaboor kar denge
 There are also some double mining punch, which youth may like
 film ke pehle half main rakul preet singh aapako chaunkaa sakati hai, kyonki jis hisaab se unke paas achche panch hai or unhone jaise uskaa istemaal kiya he vah unke kariyar ke hisaab se kaabile tarif he
 At the same time, Tabu has tied Saman in the second half
 unki comic timming or sahaj acting ne duubate hue duusare half main bhi darshakon ko baandh kar rakhaa
 Where has the film missed? The way the story of the film is composed, it can only knock you into itself
 wo isliye kyonki film ke dauraan kai jagah aapako misamatch dikhegaa, jo naa sirf ek critic balki aam darshak bhi dekh sakegaa
 All the good punches (5–10 whoever were in the film) were named after Rakul, the rest was handled by Tabu
 lekin wo bhi duusare half main gart main chale gaye
 Ajay Devgan can disappoint you in the film, because if you are expecting a breakup from Ajay in the name of a comedy film, then you can be disappointed
 kyonki vah ek pati, lover or pita ke rup main har baar kanphyus hi dikhe or unke paas kuch khaas panch bhi nahin the, jo shaayad rohit shetty ke saath rahete unhen milte the
 At one time you may also find what Ajay is doing
 tabboo is film ko baandhakar rakhti hai, doosraa half puri tarah se unpar hi nirbhar he
 He has comic timing, emotional scenes, and a funky mood, in which he has left his mark
 fail ho gaye lav ranjan?pyaar kaa panchnaama, sonu ke titu kii sweety jaisi filmon ke baad lav ranjan kamedi filmon main ek ubharate naam kii tarah hai
 But this time his story has disappointed, although he is not the director of this film, but the script is his own
 unki taraf se koshish to kii gai ki thodaa vaisaa hi tadakaa de saken, lekin ho nahin sakaa
 The film is directed by Aakiv Ali, who is an editor by profession and he is making his directorial debut
 haalanki, film kii editing hi mashallah he
 Because at the end of the film you will also feel that everything is being included in the cycle of ending it
 lekin kuch jabardast panch, dialog ke saath-saath gaanon ke liye ye film masala vaali shrenee main aegi, box offis par paisa bhi kamayegi
 So you can see it too
 or haa, film main kuch sarpriceing element bhi hai
 Which is not right to say here
 dekhen jarur
 
 or phir apane aap se puuchhen

 The BJP has been demanding the first package that has been met and is now chanting the garland of a special state and Modi is announcing it as if he had become the PM
 modi par hamalaa tej karte hue nitish kumaar ne kaha, 'bihar ko kosi baadh main 5 karod rupee dene kaa itnaa bakhaan kiya gaya jaise inhen paison se baadh peediton ko madad pahunchaai gai ho
 The helpers do not describe it
 ham ne jab paisa lautaaya to bijepi ke log bhi the us samay kyon nahin chhod kar gaye, wo isliye nahin gaye kyonki unhen hamaari jarurat thi
 Nitish Kumar also objected to the use of the caste name in Modi's speech and said that till date no one would have taken the name of caste in public but remained the candidate for the post of Prime Minister, but all these are not taken care of

 1987 main unhone ek amir ladke kaa role nibhaayaa tha jisaki zindagi heroin ke aadi hone ke chalate patari se utarane lagati he
 Robert was highly praised for this role, but few people knew that there was no significant difference between his real life and his reel life during that time and he started using drugs in his personal life too

 Status was achieved
 robert ne iske baad da avengers or aayran main kii filmon main kaam kiya or ab ve maarval ke ek ahm khilaadi maane jate he
 Like Sanjay Dutt, Robert too wasted his life once due to drugs, but like Sanjay Dutt, he has gone on to become a superstar actor after overcoming his drug addiction
 dilli-ensiaar, upi, madhya pradesh, haryana or rajasthan jaise ek bade ilaake or kai rajyon main jari mahilaon kii chotiyaan katane kii vaardaaton ne har kisi ko ulajhaa rakhaa he
 There is no dearth of people who blame the spiritual strength behind it
 is maamle ko sulajhane ke liye dilli police ne puri takat jhonk di hai
 Along with gathering information from informants, she is resorting to Scientific and Psychological Investigation
 taaki kahin se koi aisa sira mili, jisase is maamle kaa raaj fash ho
 The biggest question is if any mischievous person or gang is behind it, then how is this gang targeting women in different places across the country so soon? Why is no one able to see the person of this gang? In most cases, why do women who fall victim to peaks fall asleep or faint? Obviously, this is the question that is deepening the mystery of these sentences
 lekin in sabake bich sabase badi chunauti police ke saamne he
 Delhi Police has received 11 such calls so far
 kuch log in sab ke peeche kisi ruhani takat, bhoot yaa shaitan kaa haath bataa rahe hai, lekin police or kanoon bhoot-pishaach jaisi baton par yakeen kar nahin saktaa
 In such a situation, the police is now resorting to scientific investigation
 mauka-e-vaardaaton se forensik avidence jutaaye ja rahe hai
 The help of psychiatrists has been started
 manochikitsaalay 'ibahaas' ke doctor bhi jaanch main jute hai
 Doctors have assessed some victims, counseling is still pending
 dilli police ne is par hai level kii meeting bhi kii he
 Every thing has been said to be done
 police kii tafteesh prancester yani shararti tatwon ke ird-gird ke alaava is baat kii taraf bhi he ki jo mahilaayein in vaakyon kaa shikaar ho rahi hai, kahin wo kisi maansik pareshaani yaa avsaad ke daur se to nahin guzar rahi
 Because often such women become victims of moss hysteria, which confuse others with them
 in sabake bich phikr kii baat ye he ki aise vaakye lagaataar bad rahe hai
 Until these matters are resolved
 ye silsilaa kahaan tak jayega, koi nahin jaanata he
 But its truth has to be revealed
 subah uthne par gaayab maa-betiyon kii chotiyandilli ke mayapuri ilaake ke ek ghar main maa apni teen betiyon ke saath so rahi thi, lekin jab subah unki ankhen khuli, to bistar par pade apane kate hue baalo ko dekh kar unki hairaani kaa thikaana naa rahaa
 On seeing the news, the news spread like fire in the entire area and information was given to the police
 najafagarh ke dharmpura ilaake main bhi ghar main so rahi ek mahila kii chotii rahasyamayi tareeke se cat gai
 a similar incident occurred in Ujwa village with a ninth class student
 in donon hi ghatnaon ke baad puure ilaake ke log dehshat main ji rahe hai
 In Mathura of the woman's assassination, considering the top cut, a case of cutting the hair of the woman has come up
 aarope he ki kuch agyaat logon ne mathura ke bali gaanv main mahila kii chotii kaat di
 This is the seventh case in Mathura to cut a woman's hair
 gaanv ke logon kaa maananaa he ki koi tantra vidya ke liye mahilaon ke bal kaat rahaa he
 An elderly woman was murdered in Agra on suspicion of cutting off the top
 andhere main logon ne bujurg ko apane ilaake main dekha to use chotii kaatanevaali chudail samaj kar itani buree tarah peeta ki uski jaan hi chali gai
 The woman wandered the way and reached there
 madhya pradesh main saamne aae teen maamleghaziabad main bhi aisi hi ekavaardaatse log sakate main hai
 Here in Loni area, a woman returned from school in the afternoon and fell unconscious as soon as she entered the house, when the senses came, the hair was cut
 uskaa kahana he ki usne apni ankhon ke kisi baba jaise insaan ko dekha or uske baad use kuch yaad nahin rahaa
 Similarly, haircuts have been reported from two places in Shivpuri, Madhya Pradesh and one in Morena
 is tarah mahilaon kii chotii katane kii ghatana dhire-dhire desh bhar main aag kii tarah failati hi ja rahi he
 With the arrival of Friday, August 15, and a full three-day holiday, including Saturday and Sunday, it was necessary to go somewhere to roam
 ek 11 maah ke bachche samet ham saat log vaishno devi kii ore nikal pade
 The journey is going to be difficult, it was already foreseen, but in what form the problem would come before us, it was not anticipated
 train main rigerveshan nahin milane ke kaaran asi bas main sleeper siten rigerv karwaai
 Riding in three autos proceeded towards the Red Fort, from where the bus was to be found
 shaam saat baje kii bas jab nau baje tak nahin ai to maathaa thanka
 The crowd of passengers who had already done the reservation had gathered and the bus was not known
 aakhirkaar ham sabhi yatriyon ko traveler kii duusari bason kaa rasta rokna padaa tab jaakar bas ai
 We won the first battle by getting that Khatara bus (obviously the AC was bad)
 bheed tut padidopaher do baje ke aas-paas ham jammu pahunche
 One good thing about the bus being late is that we could see the views which would pass in the darkness of night
 puraa rasta hariyaali se pata padaa tha
 Had taken a tour package from Jammu
 so bas chhod yahaan se ham gaadi main baithkar katra kii ore bade
 While battling with the jam, reached the hotel located on the railway road of Katra at four and half past four
 yahaan duusari pareshaani hamaare intjaar main khadi thi
 On entering the hotel, it was found that the traveler had not given any information about the booking to the hotel
 jammu-kashmir main suraksha kaarnon ke chalate pre-ped number nahin chalate hai
 Luckily we had three post paid numbers
 bilakhte bachche ke saath hotel main hakke-bakke khadey ham saaton
 Calling the travel agent and heard a lot of scam
 jaise-taise room arange kiye or fatafat taiyaar hokar, tamaam pareshaaniyon ke baavjood josh na khote hue ham vaishno devi ke darshan ke liye nikal pade
 The online slip was made several days in advance, so we did not have to line many kilometers
 hamaare paas viypi paas the
 a VIP pass does not entail a long line of common people to go to the cave
 mata ke viipi darshan paane kii sabase pehali kadi thi siarpief ke offis jaakar apana naam kaa conformation karwaanaa
 There they checked our names and asked to proceed
 ham aage bade to laga jaise dilli ke sarojini nagar main hon, jahaan shanivaar yaa ravivaar ke din shopping ke diwane tut padate hai
 The journey route had not even started yet and so crowded! We kept going with enthusiasm, waiting for the untoward incident
 11 maah kaa nanha daau meri god main tha
 Reached the door on foot
 yahaan se aadhikarik yatra kii shuruuaat hoti he
 It was also encountered by a huge crowd here
 lekin sabase zyada pareshaan karne vaali baat yah thi ki yahaan na to koi parchi jaanch rahaa tha or na hi saamaan kii scanning kii ja rahi thi
 India has always been a witness to terrorist attacks on major religious places
 or ham to aise vakt (15 agast) yahaan pahunche the jab puraa desh hai alert par rahata he
 Yet such frightening carelessness! Anyone's soul will tremble thinking that if a suspect reaches here? Here, all Ram's faith is going on
 yahaan ek counter par online registration kii parchi kii jaanch karwaani thi
 We got it done, even if we got it done, khayr darshanee daravaaje se ham banganga kii ore bade
 Pedestrians, sedanists and horse-mules were all heading on the same path
 khachchar waalon or palki waalon kaa andaja aisa hota ki batch sako to batch lo varna ham to kuchal denge
 The track of Amarnath is much narrower than that of Vaishnodevi but everything is well organized there
 paidal yatri apni line main chalate hai or khachchar apni
 Nobody cuts each other's way
 bichhud gaebadal ghirne lage, bijli kaa kadakna isse pehle itnaa daraavna kabhi nahin laga
 The crowd was so much that it was not possible for all of us to walk together
 isi vajah se hamaare group kii sabase varisht mahila sadsy gum ho gayi
 We came far ahead
 tay hua ki kuch log peeche jaakar unhen dhundhenge or kuch log aage jaakar
 Tried all the efforts but could not be found
 thakhaar kar ham banganga ke aage charan paduka mandir pahunche
 Thought they might be sitting here watching our path
 lekin yahaan bhi niraashaa hi haath lagi
 They had moved a little further that the health of the young Dau deteriorated
 adhar main funs ham tay nahin kar paa rahe the ki gum sadsy ko khojein yaa bete ko lekar laut jaaen
 Eventually i started returning with my parents and son, and the other three people went ahead
 lautate main barish shuru ho gai to ham or teji se or khachcharon se bachate hue neeche utarane lage
 As soon as we reached our sight door, heavy rain started
 main bahut dari hui thi
 The mind was nervous due to some apprehension
 tabhi maine siarpief ke ek jawan se anurodh kiya ki mujhe apane baaki ke parivaar ko waapas bulaanaa he, kya aap mujhe apana phone de sakate hai? usne saharsha apana mobile mere haath main de diya
 Took the phone but nobody was ready to come back because they had not found the missing member of the family yet
 jaan bachi to lakhon paaetaja sthiti: teen vayask or baccha laute, ek gumshuda thim or teen aage bade
 Now the target had changed
 ab darshan karnaa praathamikta nahin thi, gumshuda ko khojna pehle jaruri tha
 We arrived at the hotel by auto
 unka phone aayaa, ve log ardhakumari se thodaa hi dur the
 Then there was heavy rain
 sabhi log ek tin tappar ke neeche panaah liye hue the
 More people in less space, along with horses, even sedan and shocked children
 aisa lag rahaa tha jaise sir ke thik upar badal fat gaya ho
 It was cloudy and rainy
 khushkismati hi thi ki gumshuda sadsy bhi vahiin mil gayi
 There was a stampede before anyone could think of moving forward
 log ek duusare ko rond rahe the
 The children were screaming
 ghode buree tarah se sir hilaa rahe the
 Like how all four people came down after saving their lives
 aakhirkaar ham sabhi surakshit lekin dare hue hotel main saath the
 That was enough for us
 alge din patnitop jane kaa iraadaa bhi tyaag diya kyonki tej barish ho rahi thi or aisi sthiti main is ilaake main baari jam lag jaataa he
 There was a bus at six in the evening, they could not afford to leave
 aakhri jang abhi bachi thi
 Took a call to the bus but it was unreachable
 bas oparator kaa pataa khojate-khojate uske offis pahunche
 He said in an almost threatening manner that if he does not come on the bus till five o'clock, i will give him a seat instead of a slipper
 doodh kaa jala chacha bhi phoonk-foonkkar peetaa he
 We arrived on time but did what he was told
 slipper kii jagah siten dene kii baat kahi
 In fact, all the buses here are irritated by the online booking people
 tikat online book ho jane se unki jo atirikt kaali kamai hoti thi, usamen kami aa gai he
 Like how we fought back and took our slipper seats from him
 agle din ghar laute to bas yahi laga, 'laut ke budhu ghar ko aae

 anderworld don daaud ibrahim ko lekar pakistan kaa pyaar aksar saamne aata rahaa he
 Once again Pakistan has tried to help Dawood
 landan sthit pakistani rajanyik di-company ke ahm sahyogi jabir motivala ke america pratyrpan ko rokane kii har koshish main lage hue hai
 During a hearing on the extradition petition of the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in Westminster Magistrate Court on Monday, defense counsel for d-company, backed by Pakistani diplomats, said that Motiwala suffers from severe depression and is suffering from money laundering, drug trafficking and The US is not in a position to travel to face the underworld crime charges
 bachaav paksh ke vakil ne adaalat se ye bhi kaha ki motivala gambhir avsaad se grast he or pichley kai varsho main aatmahatya ke kai prayaas kar chukaa he
 The lawyer said that in such a situation he cannot be extradited to the US to face trial
 jabaki america sarkaar kii taraf se pesh hue barrister jon hardi ne adaalat se kaha ki motivala khub yatra karata he or apane bos daaud ibrahim ke liye (anderworld se jude aparaadhon ke liye) baithken karata he
 Let us tell you that Motiwala is a confidant of Dawood Ibrahim, who was arrested in London in August 2018 on FBI information on money laundering and drug smuggling charges
 bhartiya agenciyon ke kareebi sutron ne news agency ieenes ko bataaya he ki landan sthit pakistani ucchayog ne shuru main aaropee ke vakil kii taraf se adaalat main ek patr saunp kar yah kehete hue pratyrpan ko vifal karne kii koshish kii thi ki motivala pakistan main ek prasiddh or sammanit kaarobaari he
 What is Pakistan's fear, Pakistan fears that if Motiwala is extradited to the US, this close aide of the d-company, between Dawood Ibrahim's underworld network (operated from Karachi) and Pakistani intelligence agency inter-service Intelligence (ISI) Will reveal the entire alliance
 america daaud ibrahim ko pehle hi ek vaishvik aatankwaadi ghoshit kar chukaa he
 In such a situation, if Motiwala was extradited to America, it would be a big shock to Dawood as well as his patrons present in the Pakistani regime

 Is there any country in the world that does not have a citizen register? Can a citizen take citizenship of other countries? The Congress party is opposing the Citizenship Amendment Act 
 vahiin grih mantri amit shah ise vot bank kii raajnneeti bataa rahe hai
 On the second day of the eighth edition of 'agenda Aaj Tak' of the country's number one news channel Aaj Tak, Amit Shah said that people from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan need to be given shelter, because they have been tortured and have lived in hell for the last 70 years
 Are living jahaan tak enarasi (rashtriya naagarik register) kii baat he isaki shuruyaat congress ne kii
 Home Minister Shah said, 'congress President and Ghulam Nabi Azad, both of you should issue a joint statement that all Muslims in Pakistan and Bangladesh should come here and we will give them citizenship
 jo wo kah rahe hai ki ghuspaithiyon ko bhi naagarikta do'grih mantri ke is aarope par india today / ajtak ke news diarector rahul kanwal ne unhen tokate hue kaha ki unhone aisa nahin kaha
 Rahul Kanwal explained that suppose a family came to India from Bangladesh in search of a job
 isapar grih mantri amit shah ne kaha ki wo rojgaar kii talash main nahin aae hai
 Rahul Kanwal told the Home Minister that you are assuming this
 kuch kaa ho rahaa hoga, dher saare logon kaa ho rahaa hoga lekin sabakaa nahin
 To this Amit Shah said, 'the population of minorities in those countries decreased but the population of Muslims in India increased
 vahaan pratadna ho rahi he isliye vahaan ke alpsankhyakon kii aabaadi 30 se saat pratishat par aa gai or pakistan main 23 se teen pratishat par
 The reality is that there is harassment
 'rahul kanwal ne aage sawaal kiya ki pehle jo hindu parivaar yahaan rah rahe the unka kahana tha ki wo yahaan par aise hi aa gaye lekin ab wo aisa nahin bolenge
 
 
 Either he was lying then or he will speak now
 ab wo kahenge ki unke saath dharmik pratadna hui, isliye wo yahaan aa gaye
 In response, the Home Minister said, "then Pakistan did not allow Dalits to come to India
 unka kahana tha ki wo waapas chale jaaenge to yahaan saaf-safai koun karegaa? us vakt congress ke pradhanmantri chup rahe the
 Everyone needed to be brought on the same day
 inke bharose chhodane kii jarurat nahin thi
 He further said that there is no country in the world where there is no citizen register? Whoever goes there can become a citizen? Can a citizen here take citizenship there? So does the Congress party want to say that any Muslim should come from all over the world, because if you are taking a Hindu then you should accept that too
 aise desh chalata he kya?'grih mantri ne aage kaha, 'jahaan tak bhedbhaav kaa sawaal he europe ke kai deshon ne naagarikta ke liye niyam banaae hai ki itnaa investment karoge tabhi hamaare desh kii naagarikta milegi
 Isn't this discrimination against the poor? We will give you citizenship only when we are so educated, is it not discrimination against the illiterate? bharat ke padhe-likhe vaigyanikon ko le rahe ho to bharat ke garib ko bhi le jaao
 Who are asking us why are they discriminated against? So you have also discriminated differently
 lekin hamane koi bhedbhaav nahin kiya he
 'shah further said,' At the time of Partition, the promise of India was that the Hindus and Sikh brothers who remained there, who are minorities in that country, if they do not want to live in that country, then India will accept them
 yah hamaare desh ke sadan kaa vachan he, desh ke governor general kaa vachan he, is desh ke pradhanmantri kaa vachan he or sabase upar mahatma gandhi kaa vachan he
 Which the whole country believes
 phir inaki entry par kyon sawaal uthaaya ja rahaa he?' We can terrorize terrorist camps with Rafael - finished the Defense Minister 370 in a pinch, earlier used to joke - Rajnath Singh, Defense Minister Rajnath Singh has strongly attacked the Congress
 unhone kaha ki jis supersonic speed ke saath ham upar ja rahe hai, usee supersonic speed se congress neeche ja rahi he
 When the Defense Minister, who arrived in Maharashtra for election campaign, was asked that the Congress was questioning the government about the repeal of Article 370, he said that the Congress has been making allegations against our Prime Minister for five years, yet our party has supersonic speed Is going above, then Congress is going below supersonic speed
 france main rafel ke pahiyon ke neeche neembu rakhe jane ke sawaal par rajnath singh ne kaha ki main keval apane desh kii samskruti or parampara kaa paalan kar rahaa tha
 Rajnath Singh further explained how he does arms worship every year
 unhone bataaya ki france hamen rafel saunp rahaa he jo bharat kii vaayu sena ko aadhunik banane main madad karegaa
 Vijayadashami and foreign land, what would have been a better auspicious occasion? Pakistan will take the advice of Rajnath Singh, eradicate terrorism or else it will be torn to pieces
 Rajnath Singh said, "I thought what a bigger weapon than Rafael would be
" isliye maine puja kii or ek om likhaa to log poochhate hai, maine om kyon likhaa? om brahmad he
 One has to make an effort to understand Om
 isamen musalmaan or isai karne kii jarurat nahin he
 He said that those who do not feel the soul of India are making such remarks
 raksha mantri ne rafel ke bare main raily main or pradhanmantri ke khilaaf bhrashtachar ke aaropon ke bare main vistaar se bolaa
 He said, "he (PM Modi) was a chief minister for 15 years
 vah kiske liye bhrasht banenge? patni? bachche? lekin ve (congress) abhi bhi sawaal karte hai
 Why does his tongue not become paralyzed when he asks these questions? ”balakot air strike is not needed if Rafael: Rajnath Singhrajnath Singh reached Mira Road after an hour-long road show in Goregaon on Monday
 mira road se vah kandiwali laut aae jahaan unhone phir se ek sabha ko sambodhit kiya or jammu-kashmir main anuchhej 370 ko khatm kiye jane ko lekar bhi baat kii
 He said that this issue was on the agenda of the party since the time of Jana Sangh
 log iske maare main majaak kiya karte the, lekin ise chutki main khatm kar diya gaya
 When governments come to arrest you as communist, then it is the last time to understand that you have no status now
 jab tivi channel urban naksal or communist bataakar desh kaa dushman time bahes karne lagen to samaj lene kaa aakhri vakt hota he ki ab naukari se lekar padhai par baat nahin hogi
 Now you will not listen and whatever happens will be according to the propaganda, which i often call the theme and theory
 jise lekar ek taraf virdohi yaa sawaal karne waalon ko kuchlaa ja sake or duusari taraf sawaal na uthe iskaa intazaam kiya ja sake
 Under the theme and theory, the kiss of which idol will be found in Teen Murti was a very weak topic
 isliye aaj ek nayaa topic news media ke market main laanch ho gaya he, jiske sahare dhire-dhire mim banakar aapke whatsap main aane lagegaa
 You keep eating sticks when there will be a reinstatement in the government job, but all your avenues have been closed
 sarkaar ke alag-alag vibhaagon ke paas 24 lakh naukariyaan dene ke liye hai magar bahes is baat par he ki desh kaa nayaa dushman mil gaya he, jiskaa ab ek nayaa naam he urban naksal
 Propaganda is a vicious game of new words, new language design
 iskaa pataa tab chalegaa jab lakhon naujavaanon kii javaani barbaad ho chuki hogi
