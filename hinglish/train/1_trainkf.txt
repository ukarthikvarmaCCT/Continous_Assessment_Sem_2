 hindustan ke berozegaron kii anuthi suchi saamne ai he, jo bahut saaf-saaf batalaati he ki desh bhar main faile rojgaar daftaron main rajya dar rajya kitne registerd berozegaar hai
 In this list of more than four crore 75 lakh unemployed, only few more than three lakh unemployed have got jobs, and this list is from the Government of India only
 yani sarkaar ko pataa he ki- 79,91,000 registerd berozegaar tamilnadu main hai
 There are 76,71,700 registered unemployed in Pt Bengal
 - upi main 68,56,300 registerd berozegaar hai
 - 11,98,200 registered in Delhi are unemployed
 desh kaa haal ye he ki 978rojgardaftaron main 4,82,61,100 registerd berozegaar hai, jinamein sirf 3,38,500 yuvaaon ko hi rojgaar mil paaya he
 At the same time, the situation of employment offices is also very bad
 aisa lagata he maano rojgaar karyaalay hi berozegaar hai, jahaan berozegaar apana naam darj jarur karaate hai, lekin naukari kisi ko nahin milti
 In such a situation, the question is whether the employment offices should be closed? How many people get jobs from the employment offices is like the biggest lottery, because 100 jobs in Delhi, 1500 in Bengal and 1300 people in UP only
 Got a job 10 rajya to aise jahaan ek bhi rojgaar nahin mila
 Employment offices across the country are less than one percent
 7 fisadi rojgaar de paae
 Running an employment office means that the employment that you get from running an office is a lot, or the government does not have any work, then the employment offices are running, because at least one to two lakh rupees, then every employment office It would take to run
 aise main desh ke 978 rojgaar daftaron par ek saal kaa kharch aayaa 12 se 22 hajaar lakh rupee kharch hote hi honge
 However, the crisis of the country is that every government says it will give employment
 rojgaar diya ja rahaa he orrozgaar kaa sankatanheen he
 But the crisis is how heavy these government documents tell

 70 or 80 ke dashak ke daur main aaj ke jaisaa maahaul nahin tha ki koi lekhak kuch kitaaben likhakar hi pathakon ke bich lokapriy ho jaye
 Asked about the authors of his choice, Ruskin Bond said he liked Rabindranath Tagore, Rudyard Kipling and Charles Dickens

 So, did the love for the younger sister outweigh the status of 'daughter'
 
 
 ? Although Narendra Modi did not directly name Priyanka Gandhi, but when he took a dig at Rahul Gandhi for following Rajiv Gandhi's footsteps, it was obvious that Priyanka was the target
 
 
 priyanka gandhi wadra ne hi amethi main prachaar ke dauraan rahul ke liye kaha tha ki vah rajeev gandhi kii tarah aage kii soch rakhte hai
 
 
 It was natural for Sister Priyanka to be hurt by the sarcasm done on Rahul 'bhaiyya', because 'daughter will do anything for mother, sister will do anything for brother', then Modi will also know that his target on brother The sister will get an 'opportunity' to do something for the brother
 
 
 chunavi vakt main yah avasar bayanon ke palatwaar kaa hi hota he, to kya modi bahut chaturaai se vah 'avasar' priyanka ko de rahe hai ki vah lagaataar bolti rahen or waar-palatwaar kaa silsilaa chalata rahe, taaki congress ke is 'trump card' ko raajnneeti kii sidhi ladaai main laakar abhi se dharashayi karne kii koshish kii jaae
 
 
 The pati robert wadra par modi ke hamale se priyanka pehle se hi aahat thim
 
 
 She also gave a statement in this regard and defended her husband surrounded by allegations of scam
 
 
 beti ke sambodhan vaale vivaad par jab priyanka se sawaal poocha gaya to unhone taka-sa jawaab diya tha, 'main rajeev gandhi kii beti hum'
 
 
 Now the 'daughter will do anything' for the mother, she will do 'anything' for the father
 
 
 narendra modi ko iskaa bhi bhaan rahaa hoga
 
 
 In such a situation, Modi tried to provoke Priyanka by targeting the late father
 
 
 baat rahul ke us bayaan kii thi, jisamen unhone modi ko gusse kii raajnneeti karne vaala qaraar diya tha
 
 
 During the counterattack, Narendra Modi took the matter to the last three generations of the Gandhi family to prove his anger to the Gandhi family
 
 
 udhaaharan ke taur par unhone andhra pradesh ke mukhyamantri par rajeev gandhi kaa gussa, seetaram kesari or pivi narsimharav par sonia kaa gussa or daagi netaaon se sambandhit ardinance par rahul kaa gussa ginaya
 
 
 Of course, this also annoyed Priyanka
 
 
 phir turant jawaab bhi aayaa
 
 
 "they have insulted my martyred father on Amethi soil
 
 
 amethi kii janata kabhi is harakat ko maaf nahin karegi
 
 
 Will answer their 'low politics'
 
 
 amethi ke ek-ek booth se jawaab aayega
 
 
 " ab is bayaan main 'harakat' or 'neech raajnneeti', ye do shabd chubhane vaale hai
 
 
 The 'low politics' thing struck Modi, but he tried to increase his stature by linking the gift of 'low politics' with the status of 'low caste'
 
 
 amethi main 7 may ko vot pad jaaenge
 
 
 So, the people of Amethi voted 'not for change, for change' or for their emotional status quo for the Gandhi family, its box will open on 16 May
 
 
 kai log yah kayaas bhi laga rahe the ki amethi main modi kii dhamak kaa badla congress banaras main legi
 
 
 There was also news that Priyanka Gandhi would go to Banaras for campaigning, while in an informal conversation, Priyanka had already told that there was a call from Ajay Rai, a Congress candidate from Banaras, but she had no intention of going there
 
 
 lekin jab chehre par media kii nazar ho, jubaani jang to kahin se bhi baithkar ladi ja sakati he
 
 
 By the way, an interesting comment read on Facebook - ‚Äúamethi is upset with the same siblings
 
 
 ab duusare bhai-bahan bhi aa gaye hai

 The big leaders of both the party held a joint rally in Kolhapur district on Sunday
 is dauraan maharashtra mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis, shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare bhi ek saath najar aae
 Addressing from the forum, Fadnavis said, "lok Sabha elections will be fought between those who compete with the enemies of the country and those who question the achievements of their soldiers for political reasons

 Addressing the crowded crowd, Fadnavis also took a dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 56-inch chest on the opposition
 unhone kaha, 'hamane gathbandhan karne kaa faisla kiya or yahaan tak ki tikat kaa bantwaaraa bhi kar liya, lekin vipaksh ke bare main kya? vah kehete hai ki ve sab milakar 56 partiyaan hai, lekin chunaav jeetne ke liye aapako 56 partiyon kii jarurat nahin, 56 inch ke seene kii jarurat he
 'fadnavis referred to his party's agreement with the Shiv Sena as a "hindutva" coalition that goes beyond caste, religion and language

 kisi gathbandhan main do chizein sabase mahatvapurn hoti hai, ek us gathbandhan kaa netaa koun hoga or doosraa chunaav main gathbandhan main koun sa dal kitni siton par ladega or iskaa kya formula hoga
 As far as Bihar is concerned, the first question itself was answered by BJP National President Amit Shah a few days ago, saying that the alliance with Janata Dal United (JDU) is unalterable and BJP will take the next assembly under Nitish Kumar
 Will contest elections
 lekin siton ke talmail par kya formula hoga us par BJP kaa kahana he ki ab unhen nitish kumaar se ummid he ki wo apni taraf se is par koi ghoshnaa karenge
 As the BJP has shown its heart by considering him a leader, Nitish Kumar will show his big heart on the seat agreement
 yah kahana he bihar BJP ke adhyaksh sanjay jaisawal kaa
 However, Jaiswal has made one thing clear which party will contest how many seats, after all Nitish Kumar from JDU and Amit Shah from BJP will decide by sitting together as seen during Lok Sabha elections and this is the state leaders
 Is outside the circumference of
 lekin mana ja rahaa he ki sanjay jaisawal ne yah bayaan apane party ke kendriya netritv kaa is vishay par mood bhaanp kar hi diya he kyonki party ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah ke bayaan ke do din purv hi sanjay jaisawal ne bhagalpur main ek bayaan diya tha jisamen unhone kaha tha ki NDA atoot he or kendriya mantri giriraaj singh jo bhi bayaan dete hai wo unki nijee raay hoti he
 As far as the party's stand is concerned, whatever the party's official spokesperson says should be considered the opinion of the party
 is bayaan ko is baat kaa sanket mana gaya tha ki party ne giriraaj singh ke nitish kumaar ko nishane par rakhkar die jane vaale bayanon se kinaaraa kar liya he or filhal gathbandhan dharm ke liye unhen prachaar se bhi alag rakhaa gaya
 While Giriraj Singh in his Lok Sabha constituency Begusarai has been active in party programs for the last several days
 lekin bhaajapa netaa sanjay jaisawal ke is vaktavy kaa sidhaa myne yahi lagaaya ja rahaa he ki party chaahati he ki jaisaa loksabhaa main usne barabari-barabari ke siton par apane kaa faisalaa kiya vaise hi nitish kumaar ab vidhansabha chunaavon main bhi barabari-barabari ke siton par ladane ke siddhant par apni sahmati de
 BJP leaders say that when the BJP won only 2 mps of Nitish Kumar for coalition religion, then many of his outgoing mps were adopted by the ticket of 17-17, and Nitish Kumar himself in the last assembly Despite 22 RJD mlas, he fought the election by adopting an equal principle
 isliye barabari kaa formula nitish kumaar ne bhi apane sahyogi ke liye apanaaya he or BJP ne bhi jediu ke liye
 Therefore, this time BJP wants to get seats divided on the basis of this formula
 haalanki nitish kumaar abhi tak chaar vidhansabha chunaav BJP ke saath milakar lard chuke hai or har baar unki party adhik siton par chunaav ladi he
 But in a changed situation when the BJP has also expanded its organization and the Narendra Modi government is at the center, it believes that it will not be easy for Nitish Kumar to ignore the equalization of equal seats in the assembly elections

 film ‚Äòudata punjab‚Äô ko lekar uthe vivaad ke bich bombai ucch nyaayalay ne guuruuvaar ko sensor board se is baat kaa spashtikaran dene ko kaha ki vah film se ‚Äòpunjab‚Äô shabd hataane par jor kyon de rahaa he
 This has sparked a fresh controversy
 haalanki kendriya film pramaan board (sibiefasi) ne kaha ki film ke naam se punjab shabd hataane samet uski samiksha samiti dwaara sujhaaye gayi sabhi 13 badlaav samuchit or vaid hai
 a bench headed by Justice SC Dharmadhikari was hearing a petition filed by Phantom Films, the producer of "udta Punjab"
 nirmaataa board kii samiksha samiti ke aadesh se asantusht hai jisane film ke 17 june ko pradarshan se pehle usamen badlaav karne kaa suzav diya he
 Justice Dharmadhikari compared the "udta Punjab" on narcotics addiction to another previously released film, "go, Goa Gone", in which the film depicts the situation in Goa where people try to mingle with the party
 Go and take banned drugs
 nyaayadhish ne kaha, ‚Äò‚Äòyadi goa ko us film main drug ke durupyog ke sthal ke rup main dikhaaya ja saktaa he to ‚Äòudata punjab‚Äô main punjab ko dikhaane main kya buraai he
 The counsel for the censor board argued that the review committee's suggestion to make 13 changes to the film is not arbitrary and the committee has set its mind while making this suggestion
 vakil ne kaha, ‚Äò‚Äòham punjab evam uske logon ke sandarbh tathaa film main istemaal kii gai bhashaa ko lekar aapatti kar rahe hai
 Hearing the arguments, the court said that it is not satisfied with the two suggestions given by the censor board

 Regarding other suggestions of the review committee, the counsel for the censor board said that he would give his arguments in this regard on Friday
 iske baad adaalat ne maamle ko taal diya
 However, advocate Ravi Kadam of Anantrag Kashyap's production company Phantom Films said that the order was issued randomly and is arbitrary
 unhone kaha, ‚Äò‚Äòpunjab avadharana kaa abhinn ang he tathaa ise film se alag nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Kashyap said separately that he felt that he was being blackmailed in his entire battle with the censor board to get a certificate for 'udta Punjab'
 unhone kaha ki pehle kabhi bhi board yaa sarkaar ke saath unke jhagadon main unhone kabhi yah mahasoos nahin kiya ki unhen chup kiya ja rahaa he, lekin yah maamla alag he
 While opposition parties in Punjab are accusing the ruling Akali dal-bjp of using their influence to curb 'udta Punjab', Punjab Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Singh Badal said the government had nothing to do with the film
 And it is a matter between the filmmakers and the censor board
 badal ke virdohi or punjab congress ke adhyaksh amarinder singh ne kaha ki unhone ‚Äòudata punjab‚Äô ke nirmaataaon ko patr likhakar anurodh kiya he ki 17 june ko ise amritsar main relies karne ke liye isaki bina sensor vaali sidi unhen muhaiyaa karaaen
 The comments kashyap ko basapa adhyaksh mayawati kaa samarthan mila jinhone kaha ki ‚Äòudata punjab‚Äô main kuch galat nahin he or party iskaa samarthan karti he
 On the other hand, after Ashok Pandit, another member of the censor board, Chandramukh Sharma also came out against the functioning of its chief Pahlaj Nihalani and said that he would request him to go to the government and change the name of CBFC to 'PRO of government' Say

 In these suggestions, the committee has asked to remove references to places like Chandigarh, Amritsar, Tarn Taran, Jashanpura, Moga and Ludhiana

 Something similar happened with Sonia from Bhatu in Fatehabad
 jisane 23 din pehle apane parivaar waalon kii marji ke khilaaf narwanaa ke ambarsar gaanv ke sultan naamak yuvak se prem vivaah kiya tha
 Actually, Sonia and Sultan started living in Gurgaon after getting married on 22 October
 22 din baad achaanak peedita kaa devar praveen gudgaanv pahunch gaya or donon se gaanv chalakar rahane kii minnat karne laga
 Sonia agrees to the brother-in-law and husband and agrees to walk with her in her ancestral village, Ambarsar
 lekin sonia ko is baat kaa ahsaas nahin tha ki raste main maut uskaa intjaar kar rahi thi
 As she approached Bhakhadanahar passing through the Amritsar Belrakha road, her father-in-law God was already waiting there

 The accused hit a brick in Sonia's head and then pushed her into the canal

 The mahaanthan rounds are going on in Bihar about the 'grand alliance'
 is gathjod ke do suurama tay hai- rashtriya janata dal or congress
 The Congress is with Lalu Prasad and Jeetan Ram Manjhi on the grand alliance, while some party leaders are advocating taking Nitish Kumar along in gestures
 congress netaaon kaa ye 'nitish prem' lalu ke donon laalon yani tejasvi ortej pratapako raas nahin aa rahaa
 Sensing this, the Congress is taking steps to blow it up
 sutron ke mutabik,biharke liye congress prabharee shakti singh gohil ne nitish kumaar ke paksh main bolne vaale party netaaon ko munh band rakhane kii naseehat di he
 The RJD had expressed reservations over some Congress leaders from the state speaking in favor of Nitish
 iske baad congress ne apane netaaon ko bayaanbaji nahin karne kaa nirdesh diya
 It will only increase if Nitish separates from BJP: According to sources in the Congress, Nitish is not feeling comfortable with the BJP, but as far as the alliance with him in the Grand Alliance is concerned, the idea is only in the event of him breaking ties with the BJP Can only be done
 ye bhi tay he ki congress nitish kii keemat par apane vafaadaar sahyogi argedy ko naaraaz nahin kar sakati
 In fact, the way Nitish first broke the alliance with the BJP and won the last assembly elections in Bihar by aligning with the RJD and the Congress and then joined hands with the BJP in retaliation in the middle of his term, all these developments questioned Nitish's credibility
 Has marked vahiin duusari taraf lalu congress ke mushkil samay main majbootee ke saath khadey rahe hai
 Nitish himself should correct relations with RJD, the leaders say that on the indications coming from Nitish Kumar, the Congress made it clear that Nitish will first have to talk to RJD and take the initiative to repair his relationship, Congress only after this direction i will take any step
 congress sutron ke mutabik nitish ko phasistwaadi bijepi se sabase pehle khud ko alag karnaa hoga
 Shakti Singh Gohil, Congress in-charge for Bihar, says, 'nitish is with BJP today, so' no comment 'is the Congress line on him
 lekin nitish kyon mahagathbandhan chhod bijepi ke saath gaye, ye aane vaala vaqt batayega
 After all, the politics of blackmail and pressure of BJP leadership is known by everyone, for what reason Nitish went, this future will tell
 haa, main itnaa bol saktaa hum ki endie ke baaki sahyogi dalon kii tarj par nitish bhi bijepi se bahut dukhi hai
 'including the Congress's victory in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, the Congress considers today's Nitish to be strong and weak, so if they come together in the grand alliance in future, then they do not mind it
 haalanki party ye bhi maanati he ki nitish ko lekar argedy ko jo naaraazgi he, use dur karnaa bhi nitish kii hi jimmedaari he
 According to sources, the Congress is eyeing the assembly elections in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan later this year
 agar in rajyon main congress ko chunaav main kamyaabi milti he to phir uske liye hanak ke saath siyasat karne kaa aadhaar tay hoga
 Nitish in Center politics, Tejashwi's Tilak's formula in Bihar? According to Congress sources, if everything goes in the right direction, Congress can give Nitish the formula of Tejashwi's tilak in Bihar after 2019
 aakhir congress bihar main modi ko patkhni dene ke liye bade se bada mahagathbandhan banane ko taiyaar he, wo bhi us bihar main jahaan wo khud junior partner he
 Right now all this is far-fetched

 With this order, the court dismissed his plea seeking exemption from personal appearance before the magistrate
 vishesh nyaayik magistrate priti mishra ne rajesh or nupur ko adaalat main pesh hone kaa nirdesh diya tha

 sibiai kii adaalat main pesh yachika main rajesh talwaar ne chikitsaagat kaarnon kaa hawala dete hue vyaktigat taur par peshi se chhot kii maang kii thi jabaki nupur ne elahabaad ucch nyaayalay main isi hatyakand se jude maamle ke lambit hone ke chalate adaalat main nijee taur par peshi se chhot kii maang kii thi
 The couple challenged the summons issued to them by the CBI special court in the Allahabad High Court
 is maamle kii 25 farvari ko sunwaayee shuru karne vaale ucch nyaayalay ne sibiai kii adaalat ke aadesh ke khilaaf koi bhi sthagan lagane se inkaar kar diya tha

 talwaar dampati ne yah bhi kaha ki iske alaava aarushi kii maa nupur ke khilaaf bhi koi saboot nahin paaya gaya tha
 Gopal Chaturvedi, counsel for the Talwar couple in the High Court, argued that if any evidence was found against him in the murder case during the trial, the court can proceed against Nupur only under Section 319 of the Code of Criminal Procedure
 sibiai ke vakil najarul islam jaafaree ne pichley shuukravaar ko kiye gayi talwaar ke is daawey ko, ki jaanch agency ko yachika kaa virodh karne kaa koi adhikaar nahin he, yah kehete hue khaarij kiya ki sibiai is maamle main koi paksh nahin he or vah keval adaalat kii madad ke liye is maamle main tark pesh kar rahi he
 On the claim made earlier by the petitioner that the court has decided to prosecute him by mistake while the fact that the CBI in his closure report did not make him a suspect, Jafri said, "if the investigation agency results If no judge agrees, then he is free to take any decision in this regard

 Jafri said, "this proves that Aarushi was murdered between Umesh's visit to Talwar couple's house and Bharti's arrival for daily work
" is bich kya hua, yah sabit karne kaa jimmaa talwaar danpati kaa he
 ' supreme court ne mangalvaar ko kaha ki campa cola flats maalikon kii yachika par vah sunwaayee 6 janvari ko karegaa

 maharashtra main oktober main sambhavit hai vidhansabha chunaavbijepi sahit sabhi dalon kii chunavi sakriyata badhibijepi or shivasena ke bich hona he siton kaa bantwaraamaharashtra main vidhansabha chunaav najadik aane par raajnneetik dalon kii sakriyata bad gai he
 Bharatiya Janata Party President Amit Shah has also rallied in Solapur on Sunday
 magar abhi shivasena se siton ke bantwaare par faisla nahin hua he
 Under the formula of equality in the alliance, Shiv Sena wants equal seats from BJP
 haalanki, kashmir se 370 hataane ke baad desh bhar main apane paksh main bane maahaul ke chalate aatmavishvaas se labarej bijepi shivasena ko apane baraabar siten dene ke paksh main nahin he
 Party leaders believe that the BJP has the ability to form a government even by contesting elections alone
 maharashtra main oktober main chunaav sambhavit hai
 The majority figure here is 145 seats
 pichhali baar 2014 ke chunaav main akele ladane vaali bijepi ne 122 siten hasil kii thim
 Sitting MLA seats will not be negotiatedbjp sources say that Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is not in the mood for any compromise on 123 seats in Maharashtra
 isi tarah shivasena ke paas maujuud 63 vidhayakon kii siton ko bhi bijepi nahin lenaa chaahati
 Thus, in Maharashtra with a total of 288 assembly seats, the BJP wants to split the remaining 103 seats in the ratio of 50:50
 agar aisa hua to bijepi ke khate main 170 se adhik siten aaengi
 However, sources are suggesting that the Shiv Sena will not easily agree on this formula
 akele ladane ke vikalp bhi khulemaharashtra ke daure ke dauraan bijepi ke sabhi sheersh netaa rajya ikai ko sabhi siton par chunaav ladane kii taiyaari karne kaa nirdesh de chuke hai
 BJP president Amit Shah, who was on a tour of Maharashtra on Sunday and Monday, has also asked to keep his preparations in good shape in all the seats during the meeting
 isse purv maharashtra daure par pahunchin bijepi mahasachiv saroj pandeya hon yaa phir kaaryakari adhyaksh jepi nadda, unhone bhi 288 siton par party kii chunavi taiyaari kii ranneeti bana lee he
 This indicates that the BJP also wants to keep the option of contesting elections alone open
 darasal, siton par bantwaare or kuch anya matbhedon ke chalate 2014 main bijepi or shivasena kaa gathbandhan tut chukaa he
 Both parties then contested alone
 aise main bijepi kisi tarah bhi paristhiti ke liye pehle se taiyaari karne ke vikalp ko rakhkar chal rahi he

 It's a contraction of it
 agar aapadhit'sse nahin samaj paa rahe hai to aapit isko alag-alag likhakar vaakya ko samaj sakate hai
 It can also be used as a subject and a helping verb in a sentence
 udhaaharan ke liye i thinkit‚Äôsgoing to rain or i thinkit isgoing to rain
 2
 Whose or who‚Äôs:whose Who kaa possessive pronoun he,
 Which is often used in the meaning of whom / whom
 aap isko aise samaj sakate hai jaise Whose money did he take? yani ki uske kiske paise liye the?who‚Äôs who is kaa contraction he
 You can also understand this sentence by separating who is
 who‚Äôs ko ek vaakya main subject or helping varb ke rup istemaal kiya ja saktaa he

 yani ki meri belt qamar se bahut dhili he
 5
 Effect or affect:effect ek noun he jiskaa matlab hota he asar, parinaam
 It is used in the situation after the result of anything
 jaise The pain medicine had an intimidate effect on my body
 That is, the medicine had an immediate effect on my body
 Affect ek varb he jiskaa matlab hota he badalanaa, prabhaav daalana, dhong karnaa jaise Some experts think that video games affect children‚Äôs brains negatively

 (2) People these days are buying fewer books

 Then and Than: Then is adverb which means at the time, immediately and immediately after that
 aap ise is udhaaharan se samaj sakate hai jaise i will eat, then i will go
 Than is used after comparative adjectives viz

 Differently because this World Cup is being played after the Indian Premier League (IPL), the world's famous T20 league of cricket

 Many world famous players prepared for the World Cup by playing IPL
 iskaa bada phayda australian visphotak ballebaaj david warner ne uthaaya
 Warner became the biggest batsman of the season (692 runs) in the IPL after facing a one-year ban in ball tampering
 yahaan ipel kii charchaa isliye, kyonki zyaadaatar khilaadi ek formet se sidhe duusare formet main aa gaye
 After scoring the most runs in the IPL, Warner, however, did not bat as expected in 5 matches of 50 overs, including two practice matches of the World Cup
 unhone 39, 0, 2, 12, 43 ke score kiye
 On the other hand, Johnny Beristo and Jos Buttler of England played ODI series against Pakistan in their home after playing IPL, in which both scored one century each
 aise main bhartiya team kii charchaa jaruri he
 The 15-member squad of India went straight to London after sweating in the IPL
 apane pehle abhyaas match main team india puure 40 over bhi nahin khel pai or newjiland ne use 39
 Consolidated for 179 runs in 2 overs
 tab sawaal uthe the ki team india 'ipel mod' se baahar nahin nikal pai he
 Obviously, it is not easy to step into the format of 20 overs to 50 overs
 haalanki team india iske baad sanbhalee or 50 overon ke mukaable main kisi ballebaaji ho, is par focus karne kii koshish kii
 In the second practice match too, the top three batsmen, including captain Kohli, had returned to a score of 83

 kyonki pehle kabhi is had tak kisi nideshak ko court main khule aam beijt nahin kiya gaya
 The rebuke came because the CBI director took a year late to file a charge sheet against Maran
 sibiai nideshak halafanaame main ek paragraph jodna chaahate the vah paragraph aropiyon ke liye madadgaar ho saktaa tha
 The CBI director misbehaved with his officer
 ye tamaam aarope jab supreme court main padhe gaye to har koi hairaan tha or pareshaan bhi ki kisi agency kaa mukhiya apni hi sanstha ko kaise nuksaan pahunchaa saktaa he
 According to the information, Director Ranjit Sinha tried to file an affidavit regarding the USL Guidelines during the holidays

 The new affidavit could have weakened the 2-G case in court
 ye baat bhi saaf ho gai ki maaran ke khilaaf chargeshit salaah ke naam par baar‚àíbaar alag‚àíalag vibhaagon ko bheji gai
 The charge sheet was first sent to the Attorney General, when it was replied that there was no separate opinion, then it was sent to the dopt
 diopiti ne 10 main se nau aropiyon ke khilaaf chargeshit kii hari jhandi de di
 The file was then sent to the Attorney General
 is puri kavayad main maaran ke khilaaf chargeshit ek saal baad daayar ho saki
 Not only this, he also insulted his DIG in the file

 It would be good for him and for the dignity of the organization in which he worked that he resigns

 The controversy over whether bal-gopal will participate in Mumbai's Dahi Handi festival or not
 bal sangrakshan ayog ke baad ab bijepi saansad punam mahajan ne bal vikaas mantri menka gandhi ko ek patr likhakar dahi handi main 12 saal tak ke bal gopaalon ke bhaag lene par paabandi lagane kii sifarish kii he
 However, Mandal is describing it as a unilateral decision
 mumbai main dahi handi tyohaar ke aane main bas kuch hi din bache hai, lekin is saal is tyohaar ko lekar vivaadon kaa saaya gaharaata ja rahaa he
 Controversy is whether Bal Gopal will participate in this festival this year, which is already stuck between Dahi Handi Mandals and Child Protection Commission
 is bich bijepi saansad punam mahajan ne kendriya mantri menka gandhi ko patr likh kar dahi handi utsav main bal gopaalon ke bhaag lene par paabandi lagane kii sifarish kii he
 Poonam Mahajan has written in her letter, 'dahi Handi is a famous festival in Maharashtra, but due to this the future of many Bal Gopals participating in it is spoiled
 'unhone aage likhaa, 'dahi handi pyramid main upar ke teen se chaar thar main chote chote bacchon ko chadhaaya jaataa he or jab thar girtaa he to bacchon ko gambhir chotein aati hai
 Due to this, many die and many become crippled
 aap (menka gandhi) maharashtra sarkaar ko yaa to is par puri tarah se bain lagane yaa 12 saal tak ke bal gopaalon ke isamen bhaag naa lene ke aadesh den
 It is worth noting that a few days ago, in all these cases, Maharashtra Child Protection Commission banned the children of 4-12 years of age in participating in Dahi Handi
 jiske virodh main dahi handi mandalon ne is saal ke dahi utsav kaa bahishkaar karne kii dhamkee bhi di
 Now after the letter written by Poonam Mahajan to the government, the Public Mandal Committee says that unilateral decisions are being taken in this matter
 mandalon se is bare main koi baat nahin kii ja rahi he
 Dahi Handi cannot be imagined without children
 is puure vivaad par mumbai police bhi apni najar banaae hue he, kyonki is utsav main suraksha kii jimmedaari mumbai police kii hi hoti he or bal gopal banane ke baad agar mandal phir bhi nahin maanate hai to karrwai police ko hi kerani hoti he
 Police commissioner Rakesh Maria says that he will call the boards and hold a meeting in this matter

 The Bharatiya Janata Party's landslide victory in the Lok Sabha elections has created panic among the opponents
 khaskar, mukhya vipakshi dal congress ke andar haar kaa zyada asar dikhaai de rahaa he
 At the national level, while the party president Rahul Gandhi himself is adamant to give up his responsibility, the situation in the states also seems to be wrangling
 rajasthan main sarkaar hone ke baavjood congress ko ek bhi seat par jeet nahin milane se vahaan kii raajnneeti main sankat gaharaa gaya he or congress ke netaa hi bagawati mod main dikhaai de rahe hai
 Meanwhile, the discussion of BSP mlas who are supporting the Congress meeting with the Governor has also warmed the politics
 aise main sawaal ye bhi uthne lage hai ki kya rajasthan kii raajnneeti main kuch ulatpher ho sakate hai
 This question is also because insurgency notes are arising from inside the Congress
 duusari taraf bahumat ke muhane par khadi congress ko samarthan de rahe vidhayakon kii rajyapal se mulaakaat kii charchaa ne bhi in ashankaon ko bal de diya he
 However, this entire development has been given birth by the leaders of the Congress itself
 gahalot sarkaar main mantri udai laal anjana ne loksabhaa chunaav main rajasthan main buree haar ke liye tikat vitaran par sawaal khadey kiye hai
 Even Anjana has said that Ashok Gehlot's son Vaibhav should not have contested from Jodhpur Lok Sabha seat
 saath hi udai laal kaa ye bhi maananaa he ki congress ko hanuman beniwal kii party ke saath gathbandhan karnaa chahie tha, jisase bijepi ne gathjod kar liya
 Apart from Uday Lal's statement, the distance between Ashok Gehlot and Deputy CM Sachin Pilot is also being linked to the defeat of Congress
 haalanki, party is baat se inkaar kar rahi he
 The news of the BSP mlas meeting the Governor of 6 Bahujan Samaj Party mlas on the occasion of Khalbilisomwar also served to give a boost to the political enthusiasts
 khabar ai he ki congress sarkaar ko samarthan de rahe sabhi bispi vidhayak shaam main milenge
 However, later the BSP mlas canceled the meeting
 rajbhavan ne bataaya ki yah meeting vidhayakon kii taraf se hi radd kii gai he or iskaa koi kaaran nahin bataaya gaya he
 However, even leaving the BSP mlas together cannot create trouble for the Gehlot government
 200 siton vaali rajasthan vidhansabha main congress ke paas 100 sadsy hai
 While 6 BSP mlas have supported him
 iske alaava nirdaleey vidhayakon kaa bhi gahalot sarkaar ko samarthan he
 Let there be a total of 13 independent mlas in Rajasthan
 jabaki 6 anya hai
 At the same time, the main opposition party BJP has just 73 mlas
 aise main bhale hi gahalot sarkaar ke takhtapalat kii sambhaavnaaen na ke baraabar hon, lekin paanch maheene pehle rajya kii satta par kabiz hone ke baad congress ko 25 main se ek bhi seat nahin milane se party netaaon kii taraf se hi virdohi swar uthne lage hai
 Even the resignation of Minister Kataria is being discussed
 congress kii is kalah par bijepi pradesh adhyaksh madan laal saini ne kaha ki congress ne kisaanon or yuvaaon se jhuthe vaade kiye the, jiskaa asar loksabhaa chunaav main dekhne ko mila he

 Who is the mother, who is the father, has anyone known this
 kahaan janm sai ne dhara, prashn paheli rahaa bana
2
koi kahe ayodhya ke, ye ramchandra bhagwaan hai
 Some say Sai Baba, Pawan's son is Hanuman
 3 Koi says Mars idol, Shri Gajanand is Sai
 koi kahata gokul mohan, devaki nandan hai sai
4
shankar samajhe bhakt kai to, baba ko bhajte rahete
 Say something like Avatar Dutt and worship Sai, whatever you believe in him, but Sai is the true God
 bade dayaalu deenabandhu, kitnon ko diya jivan daan
6
kai varsh pehle kii ghatana, tumhen sunaauungaa main baat
 a lucky person had come to Shirdi with a procession, the boy was a very beautiful boy
 aayaa, aakar vahiin bas gaya, paavan shiridy kiya nagar
8
kai dinon tak bhatakta, bhiksha maang usne dar-dar
 And such a leela appeared, which became immortal in the world, as soon as Omar grew, so much pride increased
 ghar-ghar hone laga nagar main, sai baba kaa gungan
10
dig digant main laga gunjane, phir to sai ji kaa naam
 Protecting the dejected, this is Baba's work by going at the feet of Baba, who says i am poor
 dayaa usee par hoti unki, khul jate dukh ke bandhan
12
kabhi kisi ne maangi bhiksha, do baba mujhako santan
 Saying this, he used to give a boon to him and would give him a boon
 ant:karan shri sai kaa, sagar jaisaa rahaa vishaal
14
bhakt ek madrasi aayaa, ghar kaa bahut bada dhanwaan
 The treasure of goods is immense, not just his children
 To celebrate Sainath, Baba have mercy on me
 jhanjha se zankrut naiya ko, tumhiin meri paar karo
16
kuldeepak ke bina andhera, chaaya hua ghar main mere
 That is why i have come Baba, because of the lack of refuge in you
 aaj bhikhaari banakar baba, sharan tumhaari main aayaa
18
de-do mujhako putr-daan, main rini rahoonga jivan bhar
 And i do not have any hope, i only trust you 1919 very much humbly
 tab prasann hokar baba ne, diya bhakt ko yah ashish
20
'allaa bhala karegaa tera' putr janm ho tere ghar
 Kindness will remain on you, and no one has found that child on your child till now
 putr ratna de madrasi ko, dhanya kiya uskaa sansar
22
tan-man se jo bhaje usee kaa, jag main hota he uddhaar
 No one is afraid of the fire, always give up the lie
 23 i am always with him, i will always be his slave
 sai jaisaa prabhu mila he, itani hi kam he kya aas
24
meraa bhi din tha ek aisa, milti nahin mujhe roti
 The cloth was away from the body, even though the little loincloth was not facing 25‡••, i was thirsty for thirst
 durdin meraa mere upar, daawaagni barsaata tha
26
dharti ke atirikt jagat main, meraa kuch avlamb na tha
 Beggar i stumbled across the world, one by one, in 2727, i met a friend who was a devotee of Sai
 janjaalon se mukt magar, jagat main vah bhi mujhsaa tha
28
baba ke darshan kii khatir, mil donon ne kiya vichaar
 Darshan of the Daya idol, like Sai, were ready
 299 Holiness went to Shirdi city and saw a drunken stupor
 dhanya janm ho gaya ki hamane, jab dekhi sai kii suurati
30
jab se kiye hai darshan hamane, dukh sara kafoor ho gaya
 The crisis was erased, and the calamities came to an end
 317 Honor and honor were received from Baba in alms
 pratibimbit ho uthe jagat main, ham sai kii abha se
32
baba ne sanmaan diya he, maan diya is jivan main
 Take the help of this only, i will laugh in life
 33 years old Leela had such an effect on my mind
 lagata jagati ke kan-kan main, jaise ho vah bharaa hua
34
'kashiram' baba kaa bhakt, shiridy main rahata tha
 i was Sai's Sai mine, he used to say to the world, 35‡•• Sikar himself would sell clothes, in village-town markets
 zankrut uski hriday tantri thi, sai kii jhankaaron main
36
stabdh nisha thi, the soe, rajani anchal main chand sitare
 He was not thinking, hand to hand, was returning after selling black clothes, Kashi from the Haat
 vicitra bada sanyog ki us din, aata tha ekaaki
38
gher raah main khadey ho gaye, use kutil anyaayi
 Beat the bite, its sound is heard, beaten the lute and chased it away from there
 aghaton main marmaahat ho, usne di sangya kho
40
bahut der tak padaa rahaa vah, vahiin usee haalat main
 Know when something woke up, in his eyelid only 4141 came out of his mouth, Sai came out
 jisaki pratidhwani shiridy main, baba ko padi sunai
42
kshubdh ho uthaa maanas unka, baba gaye vikal ho
 It seems as if the incident happened, it was in front of them
 43: Then, Baba will go astray from here and there
 sanmukh chijen jo bhi ai, unako lagane patakane
44
or dhadhakate angaaron main, baba ne apana kar daalaa
 All the people who were apprehended there, Lakh Tandavan Nritya understood everyone, that any devotee was in trouble
 kshubhit khadey the sabhi vahaan, par pade hue vismay main
46
use bachaane kii hi khatir, baba aaj vikal he
 Suffering from his own suffering, his interior is 47
 In this way, Vividh showed his weirdness
 lakh kar jisko janata kii, shraddha sarita laharaai
48
lekar sangyaheen bhakt ko, gaadi ek vahaan ai
 Sanmukh saw his devotee, Sai's eyes filled with tears, 49, calm, patient, serious, Indus-like, Baba's innermost
 aaj na jane kyon rah-rahakar, ho jaataa tha chanchal
50
aaj dayaa kii murti swayan tha, bana hua upachaari
 And it was today for the devotee, Dev became a pratihari, 51, in the odd test of devotee today, Kashi had succeeded
 uske hi darshan kii khatir the, umade nagar-nivasee
52
jab bhi or jahaan bhi koi, bhakt pade sankat main
 Baba, to protect him, comes in a moment, this is the truth of 544yug-era, not a new story
 aapadgrast bhakt jab hota, jate khud anrtyami
55
bhedbhaav se pare pujari, maanavtaa ke the sai
 Baba shattered the Sikh Christians as much as the beloved Hindus and Muslims, as much as the Sikh Christians
 raah rahim sabhi unke the, krishna kareem allatala
57
ghante kii pratidhwani se gunja, masjid kaa konaa-konaa
 The mutual Hindus and Muslims met, love increased day by day and twinkle was so beautiful, this body gave an introduction
 or neem kaduvaahat main bhi, mithaas baba ne bhar di
59
sab ko sneh diya sai ne, sabko santul pyaar kiya
 Whatever he wanted, Baba gave him the same name of 606 such loving bhajans, who should always chant
 parvat jaisaa dukh na kyon ho, palabar main vah dur tare
61
sai jaisaa daata hamane, are nahin dekha koi
 By whose philosophy only, all the misfortune went away
 Please pray Sai, Sai in mind, sai-sai in 62 months
 apane tan kii sudhi-budhi khokar, sudhi uski tum kiya karo
63
jab tu apni sudhi taj, baba kii sudhi kiya karegaa
 And day and night, only you will remember Baba, so Oh Baba! If you are helpless, you will have to take care
 teri har ichha baba ko puri hi kerani hogi
65
jangal, jangal bhatak na pagal, or dhundhane baba ko
 One place only in Shirdi, you will find Baba is a creature in the blessed world, who found Baba
 dukh main, sukh main prahar aath ho, sai kaa hi gun gaaya
67
gire sankaton ke parvat, chaahe bijli hi tut pade
 Always take the name of Sai, you all should be happy
 Listen to this old man, you will be shocked
 dang rah gaye sunakar jisko, jane kitne chatur sujan
69
ek baar shiridy main sadhu, dhongi tha koi aayaa
 The resident of bholi-bhali town, was misleading the public by showing them 70-rupees-herbs and started the speech
 kehane laga suno shrotagan, ghar meraa he vrindavan
71
aushadhi mere paas ek he, or ajab isamen shakti
 By consuming it, you can get rid of sorrow, if you want to be free, you will be free from illness
 to he meraa namr nivedan, har nar se, har nari se
73
lo kharid tum isko, isaki seven vidhiyaan hai nyaari
 Although it is an insignificant thing, its properties are very heavy
 744, which is inferior to the children, if they eat my medicine
 putr-ratna ho praapt, are vah munh maanga fal paae
75
aushadhi meri jo na kharide, jivan bhar pachhataayega
 Hardly a creature like me, hey you will be able to come here
 agar isse miltaa he, sab kuch, tum bhi isko le lo
77
hairaani badhati janata kii, dekh isaki karstani
 It was heart-warming that too, seeing Baba telling the sadness of the people, he went running and one of his servants
 sunakar bhrikuti tani or, vismaran ho gaya sabhi vivek
79
hukum diya sevak ko, satvar pakad dusht ko lao
 Or drive away the hypocrites from the border of Shirdi
 80‡•• The innocent people i live, the people of Shirdi
 koun neech aisa jo, saahas karata he chhalane ko
81
palabar main aise dhongi, kapati neech lutere ko
 Arrived in the great court of great disaster, i have got 82% of my lifetime, the feeling of madari, cruel, devious injustice
 kaal naachata he ab sir par, gussa aayaa sai ko
83
palabar main sab khel band kar, bhaaga sir par rakhkar pair
 Was thinking the mind is the mind, God is not there, now the truth is true, like Sai, we can not find ourselves in the world
 ansh ish kaa sai baba, unhen na kuch bhi mushkil jag main
85
sneh, sheel, saujany aadi kaa, aabhushan dhaaran kar
 In this growing world, whoever, on the path of human service, wins the 86th place of the world, the innermost of the people
 uski ek udaasi hi, jag ko kar detii he vihal
87
jab-jab jag main bhaar paap kaa, bad-bad hi jaataa he
 For the sake of erasing it, only the incarnation comes
 888 Papa and injustice, everything of this world
 dur bhaga detaa duniya ke, daanav ko kshan bhar ke
89
aise hi avtari sai, mrityulok main aakar
 Taught this lesson of parity, erased all by himself and kept the 90‡•• name of Dwarka Mosque, Sai in Shirdi
 daap, taap, santaap mitaayaa, jo kuch aayaa sai ne
91
sadaa yaad main mast ram kii, baithe rahete the sai
 Eight times used to chant the name of Rama, Saini 92‡•• Dry-dry fresh stale, whether or Howe dish
 sauda pyaar ke bhukhe sai kii, khatir the sabhi samaan
93
sneh or shraddha se apni, jan jo kuch de jate the
 Baba used to cherish that food with great fervor, sometimes he used to go to the garden to entertain
 pramudit man main nirakh prakruti, aanandit ve ho jate the
95
rang-birange pushp baag ke, mand-mand hill-dul karke
 The rugged wilderness was filled with affection in the mind too
 apane man kii vyathaa sunaane, jan rahete baba ko ghere
97
sunakar jinaki karunakatha ko, nayan camel bhar aate the
 De Vibhuti used to fill every agony, peace and happiness in his life
 989 What wonderful power was there in that Vibhuti
 jo dhaaran karte mastak par, dukh sara har leti thi
99
dhanya manuj ve saakshaat darshan, jo baba sai ke paae
 Blessed Kamal, with whom he served charan-kamal, 100 Naksh Nirbhay would also meet you
 varshon se ujadaa chaman apana, phir se aaj khil jaataa
101
gar pakadta main charan shri ke, nahin chodta umrbhar
 i must have convinced him, Sai was angry with me ‡••102‡••

 Reason: The Registrar of Geographical Indications (GI) of Chennai is scheduled to hold a hearing in New Delhi between 18 to 28 October
 isamen yah tay kiya jayega ki kya madhya pradesh ko sindhu-ganga taton ke maidan main sthit saat rajyon‚Äîpunjab, haryana, dilli, pashchimi upi, uttarakhand, jammu-kashmir or himachal pradesh‚Äîkii suchi main shaamil kiya ja saktaa he, jinke liye dilli sthit krishi or prasanskrit khaadya utpaada niryaat vikaas adhikaran (apiidie) ne 2008 main jiaai tag kii maang kii thi? apiidie kuch adhishuchet utpaadon ke niryaat ke protsaahan or vikaas ke liye jimmedaar he
 Punjab and Haryana are opposing the inclusion of Madhya Pradesh in this list
 unka kahana he ki madhya pradesh main basmati dhan kii kheti haal main shuru hui he or ise basmati ugane vaale rajyon main shaamil karnaa lambey dane vaale khushboodaar chaaval kii gunvattta ko nuksaan pahunchayegaa, jise duniya basmati ke naam se jaanati he

 GI seal Like a copyright, patent or trademark, a GI is an intellectual property right that assigns a particular tag to a product, increasing its potential for export, including its value (see box: GI Jigsaw)

 This law came into effect from 2003
 kisi utpaada ko jiaai darja milane ke baad duusare utpaadak apane maal ko asli nahin bataa sakate
 Some group of individuals, organizations or tribunals are eligible to apply for a GI tag at the registrar in Chennai, for which they have to explain why their product needs it
 shuruaati jaanch ke baad aavedan jiaai jarnal main prakashit hota he
 If there are no objections, then that particular GI tag is approved

 The case of Madhya Pradesh In the case of Basmati, APEDA had sought GI tags for seven states, excluding Madhya Pradesh where farmers were growing large quantities of long grain rice
 isse pareshaan hokar madhya pradesh sarkaar ne kendriya kshetreey basmati kisaan sangh, kendriya kshetra basmati niryaatak sangh or chaaval milon kii companiyon ke saath milakar 2010 main jiaai ke panjikaran karyaalay main apil daakhil kii thi
 Three years later, the GI registrar justified the state's claim and asked it to be included in the basmati growing area
 apiidie ne is faisle ke khilaaf apil daakhil kii, jisamen farvari 2016 main madhya pradesh ke daawey ko khaarij kar diya gaya or jiaai panjiyak se maamle ko nae sire se jaanchane ko kaha gaya
 During this time the Government of Madhya Pradesh filed suit in Chennai High Court
 court ne apiidie se kaha ki jab tak vivaad kaa nipataara nahin ho jaataa, tab tak madhya pradesh ke basmati ke khilaaf koi karrwai na kii jaae
 The farmers of the state got some relief from this
 ab ve aktubar main hone vaali sunwaayee ke nattejey ke intjaar main hai
 The inclusion of Madhya Pradesh in basmati growing states will ensure the prosperity of the state and its farmers
 is suchi se baahar nikaale jane se uske mulya main giravat aegi, kyonki madhya pradesh main paidaa kiya jane vaale lambey dane vaale chaaval ko phir basmati nahin kaha ja sakegaa
 Attraction of Basmati: The farmers of Madhya Pradesh started growing basmati for two reasons
 pehla, uttar bharat, khaskar punjab, haryana or pashchimi uttar pradesh ke kai kisaanon ne vahaan apni jameen bech di kyonki jameen chote-chote khandon main bant rahi he or is vajah se kam munafa de rahi thi
 He bought much larger land in Madhya Pradesh at cheaper rates
 ve apane saath ucchtar krishi takneekein lekar aae or basmati jaisi fasalein bhi le aae
 Seeing their success, local farmers also started growing basmati
 doosraa yah ki branded chaaval companiyon ne rajya ke kai ilaakon main is fasal kii shuruyaat kii
 For this, they performed, tested and distributed the seeds
 is utpaada kii videshon, khaskar khadi ke deshon, europe or america main bahut maang he
 Branded rice companies started procuring paddy from Madhya Pradesh
 ise ve apane sanyantron main prasanskrit karne lage or chaaval kaa niryaat karne lage
 The prospect of its export ensured that in a few years the Basmati paddy was Rs 4,000
 prati quintal bike
 During this period, farmers did not earn much from any other crop
 aaj iske daam girakar 2,100 rupye prati quintal aa chuke hai
 It is still the most effective crop in the Kharif season provided water is available
 dhan kii kheti kaa rakabaa 2006-07 main 8,094 hectare se badhkar 2015-16 main takreeban 5 lakh hectare ho gaya
 According to this industry estimate, a total of 54 grown in Madhya Pradesh in 2014-15
 38 lakh ton dhan main basmati kii hissedari 10 lakh ton he
 Two varieties of basmati are grown mainly in Madhya Pradesh - PB1 and PB1121
 bharat se pibi1 kism ke kul niryaat main madhya pradesh kii hissedari 30-40 fisadi he jabaki kul basmati niryaat main rajya kii hissedari 10 fisadi he
 Currently, Basmati is grown in the northern and central region of the state
 khaskar bhind, muraina, gwalior, shyopur, datia, shivpuri, guna, vidisha, raisen, sihor, hoshangabad, narsinghpur or jabalpur jilon main
 In the last five years, Madhya Pradesh has recorded an agricultural growth rate of around 20 percent and this has led to a huge increase in agricultural income and consumption in the rural economy
 is oochaal main basmati kii kheti kaa nirnaayak yogadan he
 Why the opposition of Madhya Pradesh? The answer lies in general economics
 madhya pradesh ko is suchi main shaamil kiye jane se punjab or haryana kii rice milon kii vishaal lobby prabhavit hogi
 The inclusion of more area under basmati cultivation will not only increase yields, but will not make the monopoly of big players easy and it will be difficult for them to control its value in the desired manner
 madhya pradesh ke kisaanon se basmati kharidkar niryaat karne vaali chaaval niryaat company alti foods limited ke paramarshdaata ke
 K
 tiwari kehete hai, ''madhya pradesh main basmati kii paidaavaar duusare rajyon ke mukaable bahut zyada nahin he, lekin rajya main aisi anchhui jameen he, jisamen uttar bharat ke urvarak vaale kheton ke mukaable zyada upaj dene kii kshamta he
 In the last few years, wheat cultivation in Madhya Pradesh has increased considerably
 or agar zyada kshetra ko basmati kii kheti main lagaaya gaya, to aisi koi vajah nahin ki is fasal kii paidaavaar main baari ijapha na ho
 "interestingly, the Basmati Farmers Association of Lahore had filed a petition against the GI tag being given to Indian Basmati
 yah apil haalanki khaarij ho chuki he
 Before the argument of Madhya Pradesh in defense, the Government of Madhya Pradesh is collecting all the evidence to show that basmati has been traditionally produced in the state
 apiidie ne agar vaaris shah kii 1766 main likhi kavita hir ranjha or vir sanghavi tathaa rashmi udai singh jaise pakkala visheshgyon ke halafname kaa uddhran yah sabit karne ke liye diya he ki paramparaagat rup se sindhu-ganga kaa maidan hi basmati kii upaj kaa sthal rahaa he, to madhya pradesh ke afasar ab aitihaasik record chaan rahe hai jisase sabit kiya ja sake ki rajya main lambey samay se basmati upjaaya ja rahaa he
 Among them is an old 1938-39 document of the Gwalior royalty which cites the distribution of Basmati seeds
 gwalior se hi ek or dastavej 1944-45 kaa he jo dehradun se basmati ke bijon ko laane kii baat karata he
 a report by the Directorate of Rice Development, Patna, in 1908 cites the cultivation of basmati in the Central Province (most of which is now in Madhya Pradesh)
 aise dastavej hai jo empi ko basmati ke breader bijon ke aavanton, rajya ke krishi vishvavidhyalayon main unke prashikshan kii baat karte hai
 In total, there is more than 20 such evidence
 in sabooton ke alaava madhya pradesh sarkaar yahaan ugaae jane vaale basmati kii pareekshan report hyderabad ke centre for basmati diene analysis, mumbai ke relyble analytics lab or jabalpur ke jawaharlal nehru krishi vishvavidhyalay jaise pratishthit sansthaanon se laakar prastut kar rahi he
 It has been found that the basmati produced in Madhya Pradesh meets the standards of APEDA
 madhya pradesh ne apane un vishesh kshetron ko hilite karata maanchitr bhi pesh kiya he, jin kshetron kii shkrishi-jalwaayu, mitti or taapmaana maandand" sindhu-ganga ke maidan kii tarah hi hai
 Despite this, the government's claims were rejected
 rajya sarkaar main krishi vibhaag ke pradhan sachiv rajesh rajora kehete hai, ''hamane madhya pradesh main basmati kii kheti ke samarthan main paryaapt sakshya jamaa kar liye hai
 We are confident that the claim of the state will be accepted in the GI registrar
 "agar madhya pradesh ke basmati ko jiaai tag nahin mila to?agar madhya pradesh ke basmati ko jiaai tag nahin mila to aise main na keval kisaan balki chaaval milon main baari paisa nivesh kar chuki kai companiyaan buree tarah prabhavit hongi
 Apart from LT Foods, there are two important companies named Narmada Serials and SSA International which buy rice in the state and extract rice from it
 iske alaava pradesh main 15 se zyada choti-badi chaaval milen pichley aath varshon main sthapit hui hai
 According to Tiwari, the total investment on these is around Rs 300 crore
 he
 These mills export rice from Kandla port
 madhya kshetra basmati kisaan sangh ke adhyaksh or raisen jile ke harsili gaanv ke rajesh singh kehete hai, ''ham kanoon to nahin samajhate par itnaa sochate hai ki kisaan apane liye behatar kar sake
 Basmati rice cultivation is the best option for us

 Therefore, the outcome of this debate will be decisive for us

 "big Challenges
 China's plans on paper look good but in reality how effective will it be? a glimpse of the challenges coming in this direction is seen in Yanziao
 yah hebei praant kaa ek bahari kasbaa he jise agle ek dashak main ek vistaarit mahanagar kaa hissaa banaae jane kaa prastaav he
 It will be China's largest megacity named Jing-jin-ji
 ise maujuuda beijing ke saath pados ke tiyangine or hebei praant (jiskaa pracheen naam he ji) ke kai kasbon ko milakar taiyaar kiya jayega
 "the basic idea behind Jing-jin-ji is to use Beijing's advantages like human resources and capital to develop its surroundings seamlessly," says Zhang Chunqiao, an economics professor at Peking University
 "yangiao main basane vaale shuruaati logon main ek hai bai phang, jo teen saal pehle dakshini praant hunan se beijing kii ek ity company main naukari karne ai thim
 Rent was high in Beijing, so Bai and her husband had to buy a small apartment in Yanziao that cost one-third
 yahaan aane kii ek or vajah yah thi ki china main makaan kaa panjikaran karaane kii permit hukou ke tahat koi pravasi beijing yaa shanghai ke nivasee kaa darja hasil nahin kar saktaa he
 But without Hukou one cannot get free healthcare and education
 shaharikaran kii yojana ke tahat pravaasiyon ko aakarshith karne ke liye yangiao ne unhen shahari permit to de diya, lekin bai kaa kahana he ki yahaan ke skool beijing jitne achche nahin hai
 She says that everyone from her small village has now sold her land and gone to the city
 unki jindagi bamushkil ek shahari sapana banakar rah gai he
 They have to travel two hours a day from Yanjiao to Zhangguancun in Beijing to do their daily jobs

 unhen yangiao ke navnirmit tivi stesan main naukari mili he
 He says, "our village alone is left
" " unke mata-pita un kuchhek logon main hai jo ab bhi kheti kar rahe hai
 The government purchased the cultivated land of the villages and gave free apartments in Yanziao to the landholders with considerable compensation
 achaanak badali is jindagi se taalluk baitha paanaa mushkil ho rahaa he
 Farmers have houses and money, but they are sitting empty because they do not have work in the new urban economy

 According to a recent report by mckinsey Global Institute, the pace of urbanization in China has left India far behind in this case (whereas in 1950, India's urbanization was more than China when 17% of its population was in cities, compared to 13% of China
 )
 report kaa kahana he ki baad ke 55 varshon main china main shaharikaran kaaphi tej gati se hua jahaan shaharikaran kii dar bharat ke 29 fisadi ke mukaable aaj 41 fisadi par he
 This gap will continue to widen and by 2025 China's urban population will be 64 per cent, while in India it will be 38 per cent
 report ke mutabik, ''sabase tikhaa virodhabhas yah tha ki china ne shaharikaran ko gale lagaaya he or use shakl di he" jabaki bharat ''ab bhi shahari hakeekat kii ore aankh kholane kii mudra main hi he" or yah baat samajhane kii prakriya main he ki aarthik or saamaajik parivartan main shahar kis tarah ke avasar muhaiyaa karaate hai
 mckinsey's report states that "india has hardly paid attention to its urban rejuvenation, while China has developed internally viable codes of conduct for almost every aspect of the working model of urbanization
" " isamen funding, rajkaaj or yojana sab kuch shaamil he
 The report says that investment in cities in India is very low
 shahari adhirachana main puunjigat nivesh par prati vyakti salanaa vyay bharat main mahaj 17 dollar he jabaki china main yah 116 dollar he
 The city of Chongqing competes with any city in China
 yahaan ke ek adhikari tang wain do sabak dete hai
 The first is the sustainable and stable construction of the superstructure, especially in low-income housing projects, in which the city built large and open premises and prepared them to live before the influx of population

 Govindacharya said that we have made three demands from the Election Commission of India, of which the first demand is there
 
 
 dharm or jati ke naam par bane sabhi raajnneetik dalon ko 30 din ke bheetar apana naam or chunaav chihn badalane ke liye chunaav ayog dwaara paraamarsh yaa paripatr jari kiya jaae
 He said that apart from this, we demand that all political parties named in the name of religion and caste, who are contesting in the elections of five states, should change their names and election symbols within a week
 athwa ve apni website tathaa ghoshnaptr main yah baat spasht rup se likhen ki ve kisi jati yaa dharm tak simit nahin hai tathaa bhartiya samvidhan par unki puri aasthaa he
 Govindacharya said that we also demand that after this no new political party should be registered on the basis of caste, religion, varna, language etc
 unhone kaha ki chunaav ayog ko vidhik prativedan dekar maine ucchtam nyaayalay ke nirnay ke anuroop jati or dharm ke naam par bane raajnneetik dalon ke khilaaf sakht karrwai kii maang kii he
 The Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court, by an order passed on 2 January 2017, prohibited seeking votes in elections in the name of caste or religion
 govindacharya ne kaha ki ucchtam nyaayalay ke adhivaktaa viraag gupta ke madhyam se chunaav ayog ko 20 janvari ko die gaye vidhik prativedan main maine 60 raajnneetik dalon kaa vivaran diya he jo jati, dharm, samudaay yaa bhashaa ke naam par banaae gaye hai or jinka naam badla janaa chahie
 The comments unhone kaha ki chunaav ayog ne akashwani par un gaanon par bhi roak laga di he jisamen dalon ke chunaav chinhon kaa naam aata he
 If a political party is formed in the name of caste or religion, then the use of its name will also be considered a violation of the order of the Supreme Court
 chunaav ayog dwaara 11 janvari ko jari aadesh ke para 10-i ke anusaar chunavi prachaar main adalati aadesh kii avmaananaa nahin kii ja sakati he

 Or they should clearly state in their website and manifesto that they are not limited to any caste or religion and they have full faith in the Indian Constitution
 govindacharya ne kaha ki hamaari yah bhi maang he ki iske baad se jati, dharm, varna, bhashaa ityadi ke aadhaar par kisi bhi nae raajnneetik dal kaa panjikaran nahin kiya jaae
 He said that by giving a legal report to the Election Commission, i have demanded strict action against political parties in the name of caste and religion as per the decision of the Supreme Court
 ucchtam nyaayalay kii samvidhan peeth ne 2 janvari 2017 ko paarit aadesh se jati yaa dharm ke naam par chunaavon main vot maangane par roak laga di he
 Govindacharya said that in a legal report made by the Supreme Court advocate Virag Gupta to the Election Commission on 20 January, i have given a description of 60 political parties which have been formed in the name of caste, religion, community or language and which have been renamed
 should go
 tippaniyan He said that the Election Commission has also banned the songs on All India Radio where the election symbols of the parties are mentioned
 yadi jati yaa dharm ke naam par koi raajnneetik dal bana he to uske naam kaa istemaal bhi ucchtam nyaayalay ke aadesh kaa ulanghan mana jayega
 According to para 10-e of the order issued by the Election Commission on January 11, contempt of court order cannot be done in election campaigning

 Now in the next few years, the Football Mahakumbh FIFA World Cup was about to begin
 bharat ke khilaadi pehle se hi olympic main nange pair khelte najar aae the to fifa ne bhartiya team ko aagaah karte hue kah diya ki agar ve toornament main khelnaa chaahate hai to unhen juute pahanane honge
 Team India found a place to join FIFA on its own as the only team from the continent of Asia
 lekin team india fifa world cap khilne nahin gai
 According to sports magazine Sports Illustrated, all these facts are wrong
 Sports Illustrated kaa kahana he ki AIFF ke liye olympic sabase zyada jaruri khel pratiyogita thi or footbal vishwa cap ke bare main wo zyada utsahit nahin the
 The magazine spoke to Selen Manna, the captain of the team in 1950, and according to Manna, the team had no idea of the importance of the World Cup at that time
