 The Central Government has fixed the date of selling electoral bonds for the first time under the recently launched Electoral Bond Scheme
 kendriya vitt mantralay ke mutabik kisi raajnneetik dal ko chandaa dene ke liye ab aam aadmi elactoral bond ko 1 march 2018 se 10 march 2018 tak kharid saktaa he
 According to the Finance Ministry, the job of selling these bonds has been given to the country's largest state-owned State Bank of India for funding political parties
 desh ke chaar pramukh shahar nai dilli, mumbai, kolkata or chennai sthit SBI kii shakhaon par is bond ko kharida ja saktaa he
 Previously, the Central Government wanted to start selling this bond in January but now for the first quarter of 2018, it is selling electoral bonds in March 2018
 gauratlab he ki kendra sarkaar ne elactoral bond skim 2018 kaa notification 2 janvari 2018 ko jari kar diya tha
 According to this notification, the central government can buy this bond instead of giving donations to any Indian citizen or political person living in India to contest elections
 ise padhein: elactoral bond se sarkaar chipa rahi siyaasi dalon kaa kaala dhan?kendra sarkaar ke niyam ke mutabik mahaj vah raajnneetik dal jo ripregentation of pipul act 1951 ke section 29 e ke tahat registerd hai hi is elactoral bond ko praapt kar sakati he
 However, the same political parties will be eligible for electoral bonds, who got at least one percent of the total vote in the last Lok Sabha election or assembly elections of a state
 vahiin chande ke taur par raajnneetik dalon ko mili elactoral bond ko yadi use bhunaanaa he to vah unhen in shaharon ke state bainkon main apane bank acount kaa istemaal karnaa hoga
 At the same time, one can buy these electoral bonds brought to check the donations of political parties either alone or together with other persons
 ise padhein: elactoral bond se cashles or white hoga raajnneetik dalon kaa paisakendra sarkaar ke niyam ke mutabik in elactoral bond kii vaidhata jari karne kii taarikh se mahaj 15 din tak rahegi
 Therefore, if a political party submits the electoral bond after 15 days, then no payment will be made considering it illegal
 vahiin skim kii khaas baat yah bhi he ki koi raajnneetik dal jis din elactoral bond ko apane bank acount ke tahat bank ke saamne pesh karti he use bhugtan usee din kar diya jayega

 janmdin par die gaye congress ke vigyaapan par ghire kamalnathbhartiya janata party ne akhabaari vigyaapan par ksaa tanjakaha- digvijay singh kii vajah se mukhyamantri bane kamalnathmadhyapradesh ke mukhyamantri kamalnath somvaar ko apana janmdin manaa rahe hai
 On the birthday of its leader and the head of state, Madhya Pradesh Congress has published advertisements in the leading newspapers of the state telling about Chief Minister Kamal Nath
 ab isi vigyaapan par vivaad khadaa ho gaya he
 Actually, the ad tells the journey of Kamal Nath from MP to becoming Chief Minister, but there are two such things written in it which after reading it seems that these ads were printed to undermine the status of Kamal Nath
 Actually, in this advertisement released by Congress, there is a mention of Kamal Nath's defeat in 1996, while it has also been told that if Kamal Nath becomes the Chief Minister, then former Because of the support of SM Digvijay Singh
 kya likhaa he vigyaapan main?congress ke vigyaapan main likhaa he ki 'kamalnath ek dhairyashil netaa hai
 The administrative and management ability as well as the ability to defeat opponents has made him the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh
 ' vigyaapan main bataaya gaya he ki 'kamalnath 9 baar loksabhaa saansad bhi rahe hai
 However, in the ad, where the eye gets caught in the midst of praising Kamal Nath and the controversy about which is being raised is the mention of Kamal Nath's defeat
 vigyaapan main aage likhaa he ki 'chhindwara se kamalnath ko 1996 main haar kaa bhi saamana karnaa padaa tha
 At that time, Sunderlal Patwa had defeated him in the election ground
 'ab sawaal ye he ki apane sabase bade netaa ke liye patkhni jaise shabd kaa istemaalcongress kaise kar sakati he?vahiin vigyaapan ke sabase ant main likhaa he ki '1993 main bhi camel nath ke mukhyamantri banane kii charchaa thi
 It is said that then Arjun Singh put forward the name of Digvijay Singh
 is tarah camel nath us samay siem banane se chook gaye the
 Now after 25 years, after the support of Digvijay, he has a chance to become the Chief Minister
 ' is line se aisa lag rahaa he jaise kamalnath apni kshamta kii vajah se nahin balki digvijay singh kii vajah se siem bane hai
 BJP has quipped on the advertisement printed on the birthday by Chief Minister Kamal Nath
 pradesh bijepi upadhyaksh rameshwar sharma ne kaha he ki 'mukhyamantri shri kamalnath ke janmdin ke avasar par madhyapradesh congress cameti ne jo vigyaapan jari kiya he usamen spasht kar diya he ki digvijay singh ji ke chote bhai vidhayak lakshmana singh ne jo kaha tha kii mukhyamantri kamalnath jimajboot nahin majaboor mukhyamantri hai
 He has stamped it
 'unhone kaha ki is vigyaapan main congress netaaon ne kamalnath ji ko bataa diya he kii aap chhindwara model kii vajah se mukhyamantri nahin balki raja ji kii vajah se mukhyamantri hai
 Without Rajaji, this government has no basis
 jab-jab, jaisaa-jaisaa raja ji (digvijay) ne chaha vaisaa hi hua he or aage bhi hota rahegaa
 On the birthday, Kamal Nath would not have imagined such a gift from his own Congress leadership

 supertech developers viksit kar rahaa he projectoprojects ke aadhe flats kaa ho chukaa pajeshnautar bharat kii sabase oonchi rihaayshi imaarat (north ai) ke project par sankat ke badalad mandaraane lage hai
 Located in Sector 74, Noida, this project is being developed by Supertech Developers
 iskaa nirmaan mukesh ambani ke ghar yani antilia ko banane vaali company billymoriya ke jimme he
 In this project, even once a flat was sold up to Rs
10 thousand per sq ft, but due to the dues of crores of rupees on the builder, the project has started getting clouded
 noida ke sector 74 main north ai ke alaava superatak kaa capatoun project bhi he
 About eight and a half thousand flats are being built in this sector
 inamen se aadhe flats kaa pajeshan ho gaya he or kareeb 3300 flats kii registry bhi ho chuki he
 But the builder still owes about Rs 293 crore of the land
 athurity ne 2009-10 main is jameen kaa aavanton supertech ke naam kiya tha
 But after this neither the developers paid the installments of the land nor did the authority try to recover the outstanding amount
 ab develper-athurity ke is ghalmail main pis rahe hai to bechaare home byrs
 In fact, after the Supreme Court's rebuke in the Amrapali case, the Noida Authority has suddenly remembered the recovery of arrears from the projects
 is kadi main noida athurity ne supertech ko sector 74 ke jameen aavanton kii vasuuli ke liye recovery certificate yani RC jari kii he
 Even before this, RC has been issued against many developers including 3-C, Unitech
 noida athorti abhi tak kareeb 1600 karod rupye kii aarasi jari kar chuki he lekin is prakriya se kanoon kaa paalan karne ke alaava ek rupye kii bhi vasuuli nahin kii gai he
 What is the legal process of RC? Actually, RC is a legal action after which the responsibility of the district administration is recovered after release
 iske tahat tehseeldaar bakaaedaar ko 14 dinon ke liye hawalat main band kar saktaa he
 The defaulter's office can be locked or occupied
 develper ke maamle main bina bike flats par taala lagaaya ja saktaa he or inhen bechakar bakaayaa vasuuli bhi kii ja sakati he
 But this can pose a risk of hanging in the middle of projects, as the fear of defaulters absconding
 ghar kharidaaron main isse dar kaa maahaul ban jaataa he
 That is, after the allocation of land, the authority, which was forgetting its responsibility, is now engaged in taking such action, which is expected to cause damage to the home buyers
 develper pehle hi sara paisa vasuul chukaa he
 Even after the release of RC, the developer has the option of going to the High Court
 noida athurity kii siio ritu maheshwari ne kaha ki unhen jin projects main bakaayaa rakam kii vasuuli kii ummid nahin he vahaan par recovery certificate jari kar rahe hai
 On the other hand, Supertech Cape Town home buyer PK Puri said that the release of this recovery certificate from the Noida Authority poses a threat to our project being stalled
 builder ke paas pehle se hi paisa nahin he

 The 5-star The Revenant film has already won famous titles like 'golden Globe' and 'BAFTA' before its release in India, with the film's director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu making the first award-winning film 'birdman'
 film main leonardo dicapriyo or tom hardi jaise umdaa actors kii maujuudagi bhi he
 What is this film based on Michael Panke's novel called The Revenant? Let's know: 'the Revenant' is called Hugh Glass (leonardo dicaprio), who lives with his wife and son but for some reason his house is set on fire and his wife is killed
 ab hew apane bete hoque or apni sena kii tukdi ke saath jivan or maut ke bich sangharsh karte hue aage badhata he
 Meanwhile, Hue encounters a bear
 hew us bhaaluu ko maar paane main to sakasham rahata he lekin is dauraan bhaaluu ke atake ke kaaran uski haalat bahut hi kharaab ho jaati he, jisaki vajah se hew ab chal phir or bol paane tak main asamarth ho jaataa he
 Meanwhile, the troopers leave Hue in the same condition in the midst of the icy storm, and this decision is backed by a large hand of the troop member John (tom Hardy) who kills Hue's son Hawk
 dhire-dhire is barfile pradesh main akele behosh pade hew kii haalat kharaab hoti jaati he, kabhi ghaney jangal main to kabhi barfile tufaan main use kaaphi kathinaaiyaan jhelni padati he
 And finally Hue tries to live up to her last breath and tries to avenge her son's murderer
 film kaa screenple bahut hi umdaa he or jis tarah se kahani ko darshaya gaya he wo laajawab he
 The forest, the rivers, the snowy mountains are all presented on the screen in an excellent manner
 adivaasiyon kaa rahan sahan, mrit logon kaa pani main antim sanskaar, bandook kii safai, snow fall, aag jalaana, ityadi baton kaa bahut hi baariki ke saath khyaal rakhaa gaya he
 The screenplay is great
 iske alaava kahani main kai bhavuk pal bhi aate hai, jaise jab maa kii kahi hui baat betaa, apane asahaay pita se kahata he ki 'kitni bhi tej hawa kyon naa ho, majboot ped ko wo haraa nahin sakati
 Just before the climax, when the officer asks Hue, "will you kill your officer friend?" So Hue responds, 'no, a father will eliminate a man who killed his son
 ' real lokation par kii gai film kii shooting bhi badhai kaa paatr he, jahaan lagbhag 7 maheene tak is puri team ne shooting kii thi
 The film has been shot in Canada, the United States and Argentina
 agar abhinay kii baat karen tolionardo dicapriyone apane kariyar kaa sabase umdaa or sarvopari abhinay kiya he
 Liyo plays an emotional moment with the son after the wife's death, then the helpless father on the son's death, and then the fiercely brave father to avenge the son's death
 vahiin ek hero ke saamne damdaar villen kaa kirdaar tom hardi ne jabardast andaaj main nibhaayaa he, tom ne aisa abhinay kiya he jise dekhakar aapako sach main usase ghrinaa hone lagati he
 Also, other characters such as Domnell Gleeson, Will Potter have also done amazing work
 film kaa becoground sangeet bhi samay-samay par aapako bhavuk or urja se bhar detaa he

 sunanda pushkarmaamle main police ne ipisi kii dhara 302 ke tahat cese darj kar liya he
 302 i
e
 Murder Case
 mangalvaar ko jaise hi dilli police kamishnar bies bassi ne yah jaankaree di ki sunanda pushkar kii hatya hui thi, har taraf hadakamp much gaya
 Murder, murder, murder, not to use the word
 Police Commissioner Bassi himself also said on Tuesday that the doctor or police would not be able to tell at present whether the poison was consumed by Sunanda Pushkar himself or he was forcefully fed
 unhone yah saaf nahin kiya he ki aakhir sunanda pushkar kii maut maamle ko ipisi kii dhara 302 ke tahat kyon darj kiya gaya he
 To remove the legal grievance, the amount of poison that Sunanda died due to the crime of Section 302 was removed and the sample was to be sent abroad for investigation
 par abhi tak maamle kii jaanch 174 ke tahat kii ja rahi thi
 Samples under 174 cannot be sent abroad for examination
 isi kanoonee pench ko dur karne or sample ko jaanch ke liye videsh bhejne ke vaaste hi 302 kaa shagufa choda gaya he
 If the poison is known, then the case will be solved? If after sending viscera abroad, the exact amount of poison will also be known, how much poison will go to Sunanda's stomach or veins, then how much will it benefit in the investigation of the case? Will the case be solved just by taking a full amount of poison? If the poison given to Sunanda along with the amount of poison is also known, will this solve the case? If this was the case, the team of doctors told about the six poisons in their report
 phir kya hua? kuch pataa chalaa?crpc kii dhara 174 ke badale IPC kii dhara 302 main kyon badla cese?siarpisi kii dhara 174 ke tahat aamtaur par koi karrwai tabhi kii jaati he, jab maut rahasyamai haalat main hui ho
 That is, the reason or cause of death is not clear
 sunanda ke maamle main ab tak yahi karrwai chal rahi thi
 Now the police has decided to investigate the matter as murder ie 302, but who did this murder, no one knows

 pehle din kaa samaapan mashhoor kavvaal nizami bros ke suron se hua
 Literature Aaj Tak Mahafil is adorned in the courtyard of Indira Gandhi National Center for the Arts, on November 12, many big personalities will attend the event
 kaha jaataa he ki mahilaon or ladakiyon kii jindagi main kai saare raaj hote hai
 Their lives are synonymous with mystery
 ladakiyon ke jehan main jo chalata he use pard paanaa mushkil hi nahin naammumkin he
 That is, girls hide many things from their male partner
 aisa isliye nahin ki wo darati hai balki isliye ki wo apni nijee jindagi kii un baton se bahut judi hui hoti hai
 In a recent survey on social media, women were asked what are the things she wants to hide from her husband or boyfriend
 is survey report main aisi baaten saamne ai hai, jo mahilaayein kisi bhi keemat par apane saathi ko nahin bataati hai
 Regarding your affair, you may feel that the woman in your life has had the best experiences with you
 lekin ho saktaa he aap galat hon, kyonki kya pataa wo apane un khaas anubhavon ko aapse chupa rahi ho
 This is because women are very careful about their image
 wo nahin chaahati ki koi unki galat chhavi banaaen
 The second reason is more practical
 mahilaayein or ladkiyaan aksar apane prem prasang chhupaati hai kyonki wo nahin chaahati ki unke maujuuda saathi ko isse asahajata ho
 Generally, men are interested in knowing if they are better than their partner's X, but the special thing is that women do not like it at all
 ladakiyon vaali bataap ye kabhi nahin jaan paaenge ki mahilaayein apni saheliyon se kisi or koun-si baaten karti hai
 Provided you do not listen to their words in secret
 mahilaayein jo baaten purushon ke saajha karne main ghabraati hai, wo bade hi maje lekar apni saheliyon se share karti hai
 Not only her but she also does not hesitate to hide the secrets of her friend from her husband or boyfriend
 mek-ap kii batenmahilaon ko ye bilkul pasand nahin aata ki unke pati yaa bwoyfriend ko unke mechap sikret ke bare main jaankaree ho
 This is apparently because men can never find out what women do to enhance their beauty
 eks ke kissekisi ne sahi kaha he ki pyaar se hi mahila kaa astitv hota he
 You already know that he has had his life even before you
 or ye bhi swaabhaavik hi he ki aapse pehle uski sari jindagi keval mahilaon ke bich to kati nahin hogi
 But if you are trying to know what she thinks about her past, then be careful
 kyonki mahilaayein aisa kuch bataanaa pasand nahin karti hai
 During the survey, most of the women and girls said that they never tell the truth about their feelings related to their X
 asal main vah nahin chaahati ki past ke chakkar main unka pregent kharaab ho
 In contrast, some women said that they deliberately shared their X's with their current partner so that they would know how high their expectation graph is
 apane parivaar se judi batenzyaadaatar mahilaayein apane pati yaa bwoyfriend ke saamne apane parivaar kii chhavi ko lekar kaaphi sajag rahati hai
 She leaves no stone unturned to keep everything secret about her sister, her mother or her family image
 haalanki ek sach yah bhi he ki aam taur par mahilaayein jubaan kii kachi hoti hai
 Sometime later this year, the new defense minister of India, 58-year-old Nirmala Sitharaman, can be expected to perform a small ritual
 unhen apni maang main sindur bharna hoga, prarthana main apane donon haath jodgaye honge or bharat kii desh main hi dizin or nirmit kii gai 7,000 ton kii belistic missile pandubbi (esasbn) ke ispaat ke pankh par shagun kaa nariyal toduya hoga
 She will also name it Aridaman (destroyer of Enemies)
 nausainya paramparaon kaa takaza he ki yah puja mahilaon ke haathon shuru ho or haal ke varshon main yah bhoomika pratham mahilaon ke liye mukarrar kar di gai he
 The last time the ceremony was performed by Gursharan Kaur, the wife of the former Prime Minister was in 2009 when she inaugurated India's first SSBN INS Arihant
 sitaraman kaa chayan mahaj pratikatmak bhar nahin, balki usase kahin zyada he, kyonki ab ve us samiti kaa hissaa hai jo bharat ke ek sabase gupt ranneetik kaarykram ko aage badhaati he
 Her appointment as the country's first full-time women defense minister in the September 3 cabinet reshuffle was surprising

 Then there was the issue of Jaitley's visit to Japan, which was planned several months ago
 sitaamaran raksha mantri kaa ohada sambhaal sakati thim or usee shaam tokyo ja sakati thim yaa pehle se tay kaarykram ke mutabik jetali ko tokyo jane de sakati thim
 Sitharaman was not impatient and opted to wait four more days to handle the new position
 unka is oonchai par pahunchnaa endie kii is sarkaar ke teen saal ke kaarykaal main kisi bhi cabinet mantri kii ek jatke main sabase oonchi chalaang he
 Army officials say that it has shaken the system of work "from the Brigadier to the typical Army commander"

 The appointment comes at a time when extremely conservative military forces are rethinking the role of women in battles — the IAF has hired three female fighter pilots last year, and this year the military has hired women soldiers (so far as officers Used to work only) has decided to recruit

 mekking in indiasitharaman kaa is oonche ohade par pahunchnaa pradhanmantri ke 'kaam karo yaa rasta napo' ke sandesh ke saath mail khaataa he
 Now less than two years are left for this government, in such a situation, the Ministry of Defense was clearly considered to be a laggard who has not fulfilled the promise of his very important 'make in India'

 In the defense sector, when the FDI figures were tabled in Parliament this March, officials of the Ministry of Defense in South Block may have hidden under their desks — a mere Rs 61,000 in the defense sector
 kaa videshi pratyaksh nivesh aayaa, jo sabase mahange smartphone kii keemat se bhi kam he
 The figure ranks 61st in the FDI list of 64 items — above what was found for jute and below the amount received for 'mathematical Survey and Drawing Tools'

 a proposal for a strategic partnership, in which the private sector, along with foreign vendors, will build warships, fighter aircraft and war tanks indigenously, was hastily approved by Defense Minister Arun Jaitley in May this year
 yah manjuuri unke purvavarti manohar parrikar ke is prastaav ko rakhane ke do saal baad di gai thi
 The impact of this policy could have many consequences — FDI in the defense sector would have increased, the defense industry would have been boosted and the defense preparedness of the military forces would have increased

 Shatrughan Sinha News has also won Patna Sahib's seat as a BJP candidate for the last two times, but it is also true that before the delimitation, Ram Kripal Yadav of RJD (ram Kripal Yadav) ) Won this seat in Patna in 2004
 baad main patna sahib or patliputra (patliputra Lok Sabha Seat) naam se do loksabhaa seat banaai gai
 In Patna Sahib, where there is a contest between Shatrughan Sinha and Ravi Shankar, in Pataliputra there is a tough fight between rjd's Misa Bharti and bjp's Ramkripal Yadav
 pehle baat patna sahib kii karte hai
 After delimitation, only Kayastha votes are decisive in Patna Sahib and this time two Kayasthas are in the fray and there is also a third Kayastha leader who is influencing this election from behind the scenes
 ji haa main rajyasabha ke saansad aarake sinha kii baat kar rahaa hum
 He has declared his assets to be 800 crores and wanted a ticket for his son
 yahi vajah he ki jab loksabhaa kaa tikat lekar ravishankar prasad patna pahuche the to airport par hi aarake simha or ravishankar prasad ke sarmathak bhid gaye the
 But the truth is that 5 out of 6 assembly seats of Patna Sahib are occupied by BJP and one seat of Fatuha is with RJD
 2009 main patna sahib main bijepi ko 57 fisadi or 2014 main 55 fisadi vot mili the
 But this time there is a fight between two Kayastha leaders and the voters are divided
 log yah maanakar chal rahe hai ki donon hawa hawaii netaa hai
 Just as Shatradhan Sinha did not come, the same situation will happen to Ravi Shankar Prasad
 log yah bhi kehete hai ki ravishankar prasad to jivan bhar rajyasabha main rahe
 The last election he fought 45 years ago was that of Patna University Students Union
 us samay lalu yadav adhyaksh pad par jite the or susheel modi or ravishankar prasad anya padon par jeetne main safal hue the
 He has not contested any election since then
 yahaan tak ki sthaneey nikaay kaa bhi nahin
 Kayastha voters of Patna Sahib are a bit confused because people are saying that both are Kayasthas and Ravi Shankar Prasad is already in Rajya Sabha and his term is still left for 5 years
 aise main ek kysth yani shatrughna sinha ko haraana matlab ek kysth saansad kii kami karnaa hoga
 Whatever be the reasoning, be it Shatrughan Sinha, Moslem Yadav and the Congress votes
 saath main unka apana star power yani bihari babu kaa tamgaa
 They feel that if they have broken into the Kayastha vote then this can be done

 Former President V
 in Patna on 10 October

 In an event organized on the 120th anniversary of Giri, he said that he was not running away from responsibility
 unhone kaha, ''ham kaam karne ko taiyaar hai
 "giri not only contested the 1969 presidential election as an independent, but also made history by defeating Congress's official candidate Neelam Sanjeeva Reddy
 bilashak giri har us shaks ke liye prerana hai jo vaapasi kii ummid kar rahaa ho
 After all, Giri, who returned to the summit in 1969, also had to withdraw from the Nehru cabinet in 1954
 lekin iske saath ek vidambnaa bhi najar aati he
 The event was held exactly two months after the actual birth date of Giri
 thik isi tarah nitish ne bhi apni vaapasi kii ichha ke elaan main shaayad thodi der kar di he
 It has been more than two months since he formed a grand alliance with the RJD and the Congress
 is gathbandhan se unki chunavi sthiti jarur majboot hui he, par isane unki nijee haisiyat ko kamjor kar diya he
 They cannot run the Grand Alliance on their own gestures like they have run their party
 nitish ne jab kaha ki 'ham isse bhaag nahin rahe hai', to swaabhaavik hi unki party main halchal much gai
 But within three days, Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi's statement blew it
 13 aktubar ko janata darbar ke baad media se baat karte hue maanjhi ne kaha ki jedy(you), argedy or congress kaa mahagathbandhan samuhik rup se tay karegaa ki 2015 ke vidhansabha chunaav ke baad mukhyamantri koun ho
 With this, it is believed in political circles that Manjhi is refusing to believe that Nitish will be the natural choice of the Grand Alliance for the post of Chief Minister
 rajnatik taapmaana badhaate hue maanjh ne kaha, ''koi bhi party akele mukhyamantri ummidavaar kaa faisla nahin kar sakati
 "his statement came at a time when recently RJD vice-president Raghuvansh Prasad Singh said the same thing," The JD (U) cannot decide the chief minister alone
 "is bayaanbaji ke saath hi pradesh kii raajnneeti raftaar pakad chuki he
 When Nitish selected Manjhi for the post of Chief Minister in May, it was as if everyone was playing a role according to the script
 maanjhi ko aagyaakaari or kathputli mana ja rahaa tha
 Manjhi likewise gave a place in his cabinet to the people of Nitish's choice without being discouraged and confessed that Nitish is his supreme leader
 lihaaja dharna ban gai ki ve thode-se vakt ke liye mahaj ek kaamchalaoo mukhyamantri hai
 But in the last one month Manjhi has started giving a glimpse of his iron intentions
 dashahara ke haadase ke baad unhone patna ke iees or ipies adhikariyon ko hataane ke saath hi patna medical college or aspataal ke medical suparintendent ke nilamban tathaa chaar varisht doctoron ke tabadale kaa farmaan jari kar diya
 He also suspended 10 officials of the medical department accused in the drug procurement scam
 in faislon se unhone dikhaa diya ki ve sakht prashaasak hai
 In this way he emerged as the decisive leader
 charchaa he ki unhone nitish ke kuch faislon ko lagu karne se bhi manaa kar diya tha
 Clearly, Manjhi is now expressing his strength and authority
 ve samaj gaye hai ki nitish or jedy(you) unhen darkinar nahin kar sakate kyonki aisa karne se mahadalit samarthak naaraaz ho jaaenge or unke sankhyabal ko andekha karne kaa jokhim koi nahin uthaa saktaa
 During his five-month tenure, Manjhi has not only become the focal point of JD (U) leaders unhappy with Nitish, but has also emerged as an effective link between the parties of the Grand Alliance 
 bataaya jaataa he ki ve argedy pramukh lalu prasad ke bhi lagaataar sampark main hai
 Apparently, they have made sure that if they try to oust him from the pinnacle of power, it may have to pay a considerable political price
 ek lihaaj se is mode par nitish kii vaapasi kii koshish sampradayik takaton ko rokane kii unki patibaddhta par sawalia nishaan laga sakati he
 It will be asked whether the Chief Minister's chair for him is more than commitment
 jedy(you) or argedy ke sheersh sutara is par sahamat hai ki nitish ke dobaaraa rajya kii kaman sanbhaalane kii chaabi lalu ke haath main ho sakati he
 Lalu may not agree to Nitish's immediate return as accepting him as the Chief Minister at this time would mean commanding the Grand Alliance in his hands for the 2015 Assembly elections
 lalu nahin chaahate ki satta kii kaman phir nitish ke haathon main ho
 The support of 24 members of the RJD is crucial for the JD (U) government to remain in the 243-member assembly
 jedy(you) ke paas 118 vidhayak hai, jo saamaanya bahumat se paanch kam hai
 The support of the RJD is more important than this simple multiplication, especially when more than 20 JD (U) mlas have voted against the party's official candidates in the Rajya Sabha elections
 haalanki jedy(you) kaa ek hissaa maanjhi ke khilaaf aalochana or asahmatiyon ko hawa dekar nitish kii vaapasi ke liye puraa jor laga rahaa he
 But it does not seem that this will help Nitish
 alabatta nitish ne party maamalon kii kaman apane haath main le lee he
 He is also leading the party workers
 par khud jedy(you) ke bhitari log sweekaar karte hai ki yah sirf lalu hi hai jo 2015 ke vidhansabha chunaavon ke pehle yaa baad main nitish ko mukhyamantri banane de sakate hai
 a section of JD (U) leaders are trying to convince Lalu that the grand alliance should contest the assembly elections under Nitish's leadership
 par argedy netaa isse sahamat nahin hai
 They claim in response that the coalition should be headed by the RJD as the RJD has got far more votes in the Lok Sabha elections and assembly by-elections
 netritv kaa yah akelaa mudda nahin he jis par argedy or jedy(you) netaaon ke bich matbhed hai
 There is no consensus on both other issues as well
 yahi vajah he ki maanjh ke mantrimandal main argedy or congress ke shaamil hone kaa mudda bhi talataa aa rahaa he
 However, the idea is not completely buried yet
 aapasi virodh kii jaden vyaktitvon ke takaraav main bhi hai
 Nitish resigned as Chief Minister, accepting responsibility for the party's defeat in the Lok Sabha elections
 lihaaja ve swaabhaavik rup se bijepi ke khilaaf ladaai kaa netritv karne ke liye zyada 'oonche naitik aadhaar' par virajman hai
 On the other hand, in the Lok Sabha elections, RJD secured 22 per cent votes while JD (U) got 15
 8 fisadi vot hi mili the
 Clearly, Lalu is holding a larger number of popular votes than Nitish
 itnaa hi nahin, lalu yahaan yadavon ke nirvivaad netaa hai, jo rajya main sabase badi aabaadi vaali jati he
 15 percent of the voters also come from the same caste
 is rassakashi ke chalate maanjhi ko or majboot hokar ubharne ke liye kuch mohalat jarur mil gai he
 This is the reason why they now appear more decisive and aggressive
 westeindies ke khilaaf vankhede stadium main 14 se 18 november tak khele jane vaale sachin tendulkar ke 200wein or vidaai test ke liye online tikat kii bikri kal se shuru hogi

 tippaniyan Attacking Lalu Prasad strongly, he said that Lalu has nothing to do with any movement
 ye log vot ke saudagar hai

 kya mahatma gandhi kaa koi doosraa hatyara bhi tha? vaise police to is kahani par bharosa karti he ki gandhi par teen goliyaan chalaai gai thim, lekin kya chauthi goli bhi thi jise nathuram godse ke alaava kisi or ne chalaaya tha? aise kai sawaal ucchtam nyaayalay main daayar ek yachika main uthaae gaye hai
 The petition has requested that a large conspiracy behind the assassination of Gandhi be revealed by setting up a new commission of inquiry
 yachika main gandhi kii hatya kii jaanch ke bare main bhi sawaal uthaae gaye hai jisamen kaha gaya ki kya yah itihaas menmamla dhakne kii sabase badi ghatnaonmen se ek he or kya unki maut ke liye vinayak damodar saavarkar ko jimmedaar tehraane kaa koi aadhaar he yaa nahin
 The petition filed by Abhinav Bharat Mumbai researcher and doctor Pankaj Phadnis claimed that the Justice JL Kapoor Commission of Inquiry constituted in the year 1966 had failed completely to trace the conspiracy
 yah sajeesh rashtrapita kii hatya ke saath puri hui
 Phadnis has also questioned the story of three bullets believed to be true by various courts to convict the accused, including Godse and Narayan Apte
 gandhi kii hatya ko doshiyon ko 15 november 1949 ko faansee par latakaaya gaya tha jabaki saavarkar ko sabooton ke abhaav main andeh kaa laabh diya gaya

 The claim states that in this situation it is certain that only three bullets were fired from that pistol

 pankaja munde ke BJP ke netaaon ke khilaaf baagi tevarbolin- mashaal lekar puure maharashtra kaa daura karuungimaharashtra bijepi main takaraav kii sthiti aaj khulkar saamne aa gai
 Pankaja Munde today openly put his rebellious attitude in front
 unhone ghoshnaa kii he ki 27 janvari se ve haathon main mashaal lekar puure maharashtra kaa daura karengi
 Expressing his displeasure, he also said that the party has come into the hands of some people
 is party ko sabhi logon kii party bananaa he
 Let us tell you that on the birth anniversary of late Gopinath Munde, his daughter Pankaja Munde organized a rally in Beed district of Maharashtra
 yahaan ham aapako pankaja ke bhaashan kii 10 badi baaten bataa rahe hai
 1- People's love Even today, in my companions, BJP leader Pankaja Munde recalled that his father said that even though Gopinath Munde is not among us, he still understands how much people want him
 meri chunaav main haar hui he par logon kaa pyaar aaj bhi mere saath he
 He further said that i cannot bow down to small Chillar necklaces
 2- log mere bare main sutron ke hawaale se khabar chalaa rahe themedia main khud ko lekar chali tamaam khabaron par hamalaa bolte hue unhone kaha ki ek disambar ko maine fasebuk par post likhi
 Today is 12 December
 main kya kadam uthaa rahi hum yah sab dekh rahe hai
 People were running news about me by quoting sources
 itane bhi achche logon ke sutara the to kisi ko yah pataa kyon nahin laga ki devendra fadanvis or ajit pavaar shapath lene vaale hai
 3- i do not cheat anyone
 Talking about the doubts of BJP leaders, Pankaj said that people are with me
 maine sangharsh yatra nikaali or mere saath log khadey rahe
 During the assembly elections, i campaigned to make Devendra Fadnavis the Chief Minister
 har vidhayak ke prachaar ke liye gai taaki maharashtra main sarkaar ban sake
 But those people thought that i was going to cheat
 mere andar gopinath munde ke sanskaar hai
 i do not cheat anyone
 4- mujhe un logon se koi apeksha nahinpankaja munde ne aage kaha ki mujhe un logon se koi apeksha nahin he
 i wrote in my post that First Nation, Second Party and Third I
 to kaise un logon ne yah soch liya ki maine dhokhaa karne vaali hum
 5- It was spread in the media that the Humbizip leader, who left the party, in his address further said that in the media too it was said that i am going to leave the party
 jaise nath bhaau (ekanath khadse) ne bolaa ki hamen party ke daravaaje se hi baahar nikaalane kii koshish ho rahi he to ham kya karen aakhir
 6- Rumor has been raised that i will form a separate party
 Pipankaja Munde, showing his opposing attitude, said that it was rumored that i will form a separate party
 party ke hi log mujhe gunahagaar bataane lage
 At one time Lal Krishna Advani, Nitin Gadkari, Gopinath Munde used to run BJP
 lekin unke baad pradhanmantri narendra modi or amit shah party kii kaman sanbhale hue hai
 This is a process
 nae log aaenge or badalte jaaenge
 The party is not of one person
 7- mujhe pad kii apeksha nahinpankaja ne aage kaha ki kuch logon ke haath main ab party aa gai he
 This party has to be the party of all people and not some people
 aaj main kor cameti kii sadsy tak nahin hum
 i do not expect any position
 8- ajit pavaar kaa party chhod kar janaa mujhe acha nahin lagaajit pavaar kii baghawat par baat karte hue unhone kaha ki ajit pavaar ke shapath lene ke baad maine supriya sule ke ankhon main aansu bhi dekhe
 i am very sad to see this
 ghar jab tuutata he tab mujhe pataa he kya hota he
 i told Supriya Sule and one of my common friends that i did not like Ajit Pawar leaving the party
 iske baad bhi wo baad main logon se khushi-khushi milti raheen, kyonki unke peeche unke pita sharad pavaar khadey the
 9- i will travel all over Maharashtra with a torch, in my address, Pankaja Munde further said that i will decide later whether i will raise my party or not
 main haath main mashaal lekar puure maharashtra kaa daura karuungi
 i will take out Sangharsh Yatra again and tell you what i am
 10- shant baithi hum to yah mat samajhnaa ki aag nahin hapankaja ne apana gussa jaahir karte hue kaha ki shant baithi hum to yah mat samajhnaa ki aag nahin he mujhamen, agar jalane lagi to samandar kam pad jayega bujhane ke liye

 ruthik is film main amitabh bachchan ke alaava or bhi kai kalakaaron kii awaz nikaalte hue dekhe jaaenge
 The comments bataaya ja rahaa he ki film karte samay jab ruthik ne amitabh bachchan kii awaz nikali tab log dang rah gaye kyonki vah awaz amitabh bachchan se kaaphi had tak mil rahi thi
 Sources also state that at first there was an idea to get Amitabh Bachchan's voice from a dubbing artist but later Hrithik decided to do it himself and collaborated with sound designer Rasul Pookutty to do it
 ek akhbaar ko die intervyuu main ruthik ne kaha ki mujhe lagata he ki amitabh bachchan kii shakhsiyat kaa jo prabhaav hamaari janareshan par he yah usee kaa asar he
 Apart from that, hard work is the result
 aapako bataa den ki ruthik roshan bhi kuch sitaron kii awaz nikalate hai or mimicri karnaa unhen pasand he
 Actually, in the film 'kaabil', Hrithik is playing the role of a blind person, who makes a voice
 film main ruthik ek aam aadmi hai, jo film industry main dabing artist ke taur par kaam karke paisa kamaate hai
 Apart from Amitabh Bachchan, Hrithik will be seen making the voice of many other actors besides Bachchan
 tippaniyan It is being told that while doing the film, when Hrithik came out the voice of Amitabh Bachchan, then people were stunned because that voice was meeting Amitabh Bachchan to a great extent
 sutara yah bhi bataate hai ki pehle amitabh bachchan kii awaz ko kisi dabing artist se karaane kaa vichaar tha magar baad main ruthik ne khud ise karne kaa faisla liya or sound diziner rasul pukutti ke saath milakar ise anjaam diya
 In an interview to a newspaper, Hrithik said that i think the impact of Amitabh Bachchan's personality on our generation is the same
 uske alaava kadi mehnat kaa nateeja he
 Let us tell you that Hrithik Roshan also emits some stars and he likes to mimic

 ise dekhte hue akhilesh sarkaar or samaajawaadee party ne apane netaaon ko logon ke bich jaakar unki samasyaayein sunne main lagaaya he
 In a similar effort, Raj Bahadur Lohia, a ministerial status in Mahoba district of Bundelkhand and vice-president of Sainik Welfare Corporation, reached village Sijhri
 unka kaarykram logon kii samasyaayein sunne ke saath gaanv main hi raatri vishram kaa tha
 But a student there heard that such a response was not made from Netaji
 unhone gaanv main raatri vishram kaa kaarykram radd kar jila mukhyalay laut janaa hi behatar samajha
 In fact, when the Minister-rated Raj Bahadur reached the village, he was stunned by the reception by the disciples and wearing flowers
 gaanv ke pradhan ko saath bithakar chaoupal bhi jodi gai
 Also, told the people that if you have any problems, then tell them, which will be tried to remove them at the government level
 logon ne sadak, bijli, pani jaisi samasyaayein ginanaa shuru kiya
 Reported a problem with a nation card
 aise main raaj bahadur har sawaal par yahi rata rataya jawaab dete najar aae, 'hamaari sarkaar ko chaar saal ho gaye, kai yojanaon ke liye karodon rupee die gaye
 If i had told these problems beforehand, why would they have remained silent for four years
 'mantri ji ke saamne khulkar boli chatrib raaj bahadur ji ko koun bataata ki wo beete chaar saal main is tarahachaoupallgakar gaanv main netaa pehle samasyaayein sunne hi kab aae
 But Raj Bahadur's real problem was yet to begin
 kiran naam kii 16 varshiya chaatra kiran samasyaayein sunaane ke liye khadi hui to netaa ji kii bolti hi band ho gai
 Kiran, while recounting it in full chaupal, said, 'when the first leaders had come to the village, they had promised very enthusiastically to build an inter college
 lekin kuch kiya nahin
 We also want girl students with inter degree colleges
 hamen pataa he aap nahin de paaenge
 Will just say
 aap bade achche shabdon ke saath sab kuch karaane kii baat kah jaaenge lekin karvaa kuch bhi nahin paaenge
 Along with saying, you should also learn to do it, Mr
 Minister
 'vot ke liye karte hai vaadechatra kiran ne kaha, 'ministar kaa kaam hota he raashtra ko behatar bananaa, path pradarshak bananaa, naa ki kisi kii baat sun lenaa or taal dena
 This is what all leaders do
 kyonki chunaav aa rahe hai to bade-bade netaa sabhi jagah gum rahe hai
 Saying, win us, win us
 jeet gaye to acha he, haar gaye to kuch nahin
 'the student asked for Netaji, and the people were speaking silently and everyone along with Netaji was listening silently
 chaatra ne kaha, 'meri baat sabko buree lag rahi hogi, kyonki satya sab ko kadava lagata he
 We want inter college, degree college
 chaatra ne raaj bahadur kii ore rukh karte hue kaha, 'aap kah to jaaenge
 But tell me, will you get college? On asking the direct question of the student, Raj Bahadur sighed and said that if you are talking to everyone, then do it
 is par phir chaatra ne kaha, 'main aapse puch rahi hum, aap bataaie naa
 On this, Raj Bahadur said that the village head has already told the problem you have told
 chaatra ke tevar dekhakar aakhir use taaliyaan bajaakar chup karne ke liye majaboor kar diya gaya
 But by then Netaji's chaupal was definitely destroyed

 Another minister of the UPA government has now joined the Jubani war of Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav and Congress leader Beni Prasad Verma
 kendriya nagirak uddyan mantri ajit singh ne bhimulaayam sinhaper tikhi tippanee kii he
 He has said that before speaking Mulayam should think what he is saying, because he speaks something in the morning and something else in the evening
 ajit singh ke mutabikmulaayamane pehle sarkaar kii aalochana kii phir unke bete ne kaha ki ham samarthan waapas le lenge, lekin baad main vah badal gaye
 Significantly, while attacking the SP once again, Beni Prasad Verma said on Saturday that Mulayam Singh's party will win only four seats in the next Lok Sabha elections and the party's party will be removed
 duusari taraf samaajawaadee party ke mahasachiv ramgopal yadav ne benny prasad ke bayaan par pratikriya dete hue kaha ki benny ko ham gambhirtha se nahin lete
 According to Ram Gopal, he has a pity not to win his son
 benny banaam mulaayamgauratlab he sara vivaad benny prasad verma ke us bayaan se shuru hua tha, jisamen unhone kaha tha kimulaayam singh yadavagunda hai or unke sambandh aatankwaadiyon se hai
 He later reiterated his statement in Parliament, which caused a lot of uproar
 baad main is vivaadit bayaan par benny prasad verma ne khed jataayaa
 Beni Prasad Verma said that if anyone is hurt by my words, i am sorry
 benny prasad ke khed jataane ke baad yah maamla thanda pad gaya tha
 However, the latest attacks from both the sides have made the case aggravated
 aakhir faisle kii ghadi aa hi gai
 In response, fear of violent communal riots left the state and central government sleepless
 par 28 sitambar ko jab supreme court ne elahabaad hycourt kii lakhanu peeth ko ram janmabhumi-babari masjid kii jameen ke malikana haq kaa faisla sunaane kii hari jhandi dikhaai, us roj ayodhya kii paavan dharti or nawabon kii rajdhani rahe faijabad main jindagi hameshaa kii tarah saamaanya thi
 Hindu devotees were visiting various dargahs and mausoleums in the shadow of the shrines in Ayodhya, while Muslim youth and old people wandered comfortably in the centuries-old temple streets and streets
 hameshaa kii tarah muslim karigar maalaaen, bhagava dhvaj, dholak or puja saamagree bech rahe the
 After all, Ayodhya is described in the Atharvaveda as 'a city inhabited by gods and as calm as heaven'
 bhagwaan ram kii janmabhumi ayodhya main sarayu nadi ke kinare mandiron ke bich kshatigrast ho rahi ek oonchi minar he
 No one knows what its significance is, though everyone in this holy city feels that the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb built it on a pool that is covered with a huge iron pan
 sabhi dharmon ke liye akeshwarwad kii pratik is minar se kuch furlongs kii duuri par prasiddh hanuman gadhi sthit he, jahaan se hanuman ramajnmabhumi yaa ramkot par najar rakhte hai
 Hanuman Garhi was built by the Nawab shuja-ud-daula, the tnuk-mizaz of Awadh
 tab avadh kii rajdhani faijabad thi
 In this temple, Hanuman is seated in the lap of his mother Anjani in a gold statue
 is chaukor kilanuma mandir ke ek hisse main sarvadharm satyar mandir he, jisamen bhagwaan ram, gautam buddha, bhagwaan mahavir kii pratimaayein, makka-madina kii tasviir or paigambar zarathustra kii tasviir lagi he
 Faizabad resident and editor of urdu-hindi weekly Your Strength S
 manjar mehadi bataate hai ki teen saal pehle tak hanuman gadhi ke mahant ramajaan ke dauraan iftaar kii daavat dete the, lekin vishwa hindu parishad (vihip) ke dabaav main yah band kar di gai
 Despite this, Ayodhya with some 1,200 temples is one such bouquet which has a variety of fragrant flowers
 ayodhya kaa matlab he jise jeeta na ja sake or vah paraspar hdhem bhav kaa pratik hua karti thi, par hindu-muslim vivaad ne use dharmik or sampradayik sangharsh kaa pratik bana diya
 Hadiim Ansari, 91, a litigant in a court battle, recalls, "as long as the case of hindu-muslim shrines was legal, his dignity and dignity were intact
" par ab vah khatm ho gai he
 "he says that in those days he used to sit on the same leg with Paramhansa Ramchandra Das and go to civil court and often Paramhans paid the rent
 ''mujhe masjid kii tamir (nirmaan) se zyada hindu-muslim ekta or aapasi pyaar kii chintaa he
 Equally concerned is Acharya Satyendra Das, the chief priest of Ramlala
 ''mujhe samajh main nahin aata ki kuch log kyon lard rahe hai? jab ishwar insaanon main fark nahin karata to ham aisa karne vaale koun hai?'' ayodhya ke hinduon or musalamaanon main se kai kaa kahana he ki bahari log hi fitna failaa rahe hai or is pavitra bhoomi ko badnaam kar rahe hai
 But most people believe this mythology of the origin of Ayodhya: "swayambhu Manu, the eldest son of Brahma, the savior of his people, once reached his father's house with folded hands
 prasann brahma ne poocha, 'putr, sheeghra bataao, tum yahaan kyon aae ho?' manu jhukkar bole, 'aapane mujhe sristi kii rachana kaa aadesh diya he, kripaya mujhe mere vaas ke liye uchit sthaan den
 'brahma went to Vaikuntha, the abode of Lord Vishnu with his son, and folded his hands and said to Lord Vishnu in a sweet voice,' o God of gods, you always have kindness on your devotees and Manu is one of them
 atah use rahane ke liye koi jagah de den
 Pleased by this, Vishnu gave him a beautiful and magnificent Iyodhyanagri situated in the middle of the earth
 iske baad brahma manu ke saath ihalok main aae or unki marji ke mutabik shahar kaa nirmaan karne ke liye vishnu ne vashishtha or vishwakarma ko bheja
 The place was chosen according to the wishes of the gods, but it was not habitable
 vahaan sudarshan chakra banaaya gaya or usee par shahar kii neenv rakhi gai
 Various temples, palaces, roads, markets, trees and plants filled with fruits and flowers, gems with soft tones, innumerable elephants, horses, chariots, cows, bulls made of jewels and all kinds of men and women doing all the work
 Facility provided
 khubasurat ghaaton vaali sarayu uske paas hi bahati he
 However, in the other corner of the city is the Mashar Dargah of Hazrat Sheesh, son of Prophet Adam, the first messenger of God
 iske chaaron ore unki patni or chah beton kii kabren hai
 Then the dargah is Naugji

 hindu-muslims from all over the country reach Jiyarat at this tomb 2 meters long
 ayodhya naresh ke mahal ke nikat sthit yah dargah hazrat nuh kii bataai jaati he, jo bahut-se shraddhaluon ke liye kisi mandir se kam nahin he
 According to young Muslim fruit seller Rizwan Ahmed, "in my childhood i used to hear that there were about 80 mausoleums and dargahs, where the temple visitors used to come
" par ab koi 20 majaar or dargah bache hai
 Therefore, local Muslims consider Ayodhya as mecca-khurd (small Mecca)
 vidwaan bataate hai ki 12veen sadi se hi sufi sant ayodhya ko aadhyatmik shiksha kaa centre maanate rahe hai
 Among those Sufis were Qazi Kidwatuddin Awadhi from Central Asia
 mughalon se pehle sufiyon ke firdausia panth ke ek or sufi the shaikh jamaal gujjari
 But in the early 1980s, the presence of Sufis and prophets in the storm of Ram janmabhoomi-babri Masjid was forgotten
 udhar, ayodhya kii kahani main ek nayaa mode bhi aayaa jab ramajnmabhumi vivaad kii kanoonee ladaai main kuch buddha ek paksh bananaa chaahate the
 He said that Ayodhya was a Buddhist center but during the Janajagaran movement in the Middle Ages, monasteries were captured and converted into temples
 par is daawey main koi dam nahin paaya gaya
 In Buddhist tradition, Ayodhya is known as Saket or Kaushal, which was part of the kingdom of Lord Buddha's father, Shuddhodhana
 chini buddha yatri hwain sang ne ayodhya kii yatra main vahaan koi 3,000 buddha bhikshu paae the, duusare dharmavalambiyon kii sankhya bahut kam thi
 Then there used to be some 100 Buddhist monasteries and 10 big Buddhist temples in Ayodhya
 hinduon kii pavitra nagari main 32 masjiden bhi hai, jahaan se mandiron kii deevaaron par ajaan goonjati he, jo bhajanon tathaa anwarat gaai jaati hanuman chalisa kii dhun main mil jaati he
 The head of Shani Dham, 55-year-old astrologer Hardayal Shastri, says that this land of Lord Rama is truly blessed
 hinduon ke saath hi ayodhya musalamaanon, jainiyon, sikhon or baudhon ke liye bhi pavitra nagari he
 And this is not without reason
 ayodhya jain panth ke paanch devon-rishabh dev, ajeetnath, abhinandan-nath, anudnath or sumatinath-kii janmasthali he, jabaki sikh samudaay ke pehle guru nanakdev, 9wein guru teg bahadur or 10wein guru govind singh ne yahaan gurdvara brahmakund main dhyaan kiya tha
 The Gurdwara at Brahmaghat is one of the oldest gurdwaras and according to the legend, Lord Brahma did penance for 5,000 years at this place
 ayodhya nawabon kii rajdhani rahe faijabad se maatr chah kimi kii duuri par sthit he
 The Nawabs, originally of Iranian background, were relatively secular and valued the religious sentiments of their people

 "people from outside demolished the Babri Masjid in 1992 but since then there has never been any communal tension or curfew imposed in Faizabad
 urdu sahitya main faijabad kaa khaas sthaan he
 Besides Mir Anis, Shakespeare of Urdu, many well-known poets and Adib were from Faizabad

 Later Begum Akhtar (akhtari Bai), through her singing c
 jal, thumari or daadaraa ko ghar-ghar tak pahunchaa diya
 But Manjar Mehdi, who is campaigning to save the Nawabi-era monuments, sees it from another point of view, "this general lawsuit of ownership was given a communal color and some forces destroyed memories of Nawabi architecture, culture, glory and honor
" Waged a political battle to nawabon ne hi ayodhya ko ekta or hdhem kii misaal kaayam karne main madad kii thi
 The fall of Ayodhya began with the Nawabs building their capital Lucknow
 baxur kii jang ke baad angrejon ne sarayu ke tat par sthit nawab kii khubasurat kachhari ko opium daftar evam malkhane main tabdeel kar diya
 One of the tunnels between Lucknow and Faizabad was in the court
 usamen nawabon or avadh ke raajaaon kii chitradirgha he
 Except for a small office, the rest of the campus looks deserted and dirty
 tab puure shahar ko bangale ke rup main janaa jaataa tha
 Manjar Mehdi explains that another example of catastrophe is Gulabbadi, another highly acclaimed work by Nawab shuja-ud-daula
 dizin or sthapaty ke maamle main ise chota tajmahal maanate hai
 First of all, the district administration put up a huge Ashoka Pillar in the premises in 1952 so that it no longer looks properly from outside
 jhrane suukh gaye hai or gulabon kii prajatiyaan bhi khatm ho gai hai
 Once upon a time, black roses were found here
 usamen nawab shuja-ud-daula kaa makbara bhi he
 No one is going to take care of him even though the campus is under ASI
 mir anis kaa ghar awara pashuon kaa thikaana bana diya gaya tha, par virodh hone par use pustkaalay main tabdeel kar diya gaya
 Manjar Mehdi states that one no longer remembers Fort Calcutta, which shuja-ud-daula had built to live after losing to the British
 26 janvari, 1775 ko unki maut ke baad unki vidhwaa begum ummat johra urf bahu begum vahiin rahati thi
 The next Nawab asaf-ud-daula made his capital at Lucknow

 Other architecturally beautiful monuments include Bahu Begum's Tomb, which is the tallest building in the state and is beautiful from Asafi Imambara in Lucknow

 Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and her daughter Aaradhya's love is not hidden from anyone

 Apart from this, Aishwarya had also taken daughter Aaradhya to the Cannes Film Festival
 is dauraan unhone maa kii jimmedaari bakhubi nibhaai
 Aishwarya recently spoke about her daughter and personal life in an interview given to IANS
 aish ne kaha ki maine khushi-khushi aradhya kii maa kaa kirdaar nibhaayaa or baaki kaamon ko zyada tavajjo nahin di
 Aishwarya, speaking in Cannes, does not mean to be silly to make up

 (input bhashaa se) External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj on Thursday denied the alleged claims of senior journalist Ved Pratap Vaidik that the Indian High Commission in Islamabad was aware of his meeting with Hafiz Saeed, head of jamaat-ud-dawa during his visit to Pakistan
 sushamaa swaraj ne loksabhaa main die ek bayaan main kaha ki vaidic hafiz mulaakaat ke bare main pakistan se bhartiya ucchayog kii report aa gai he or usamen saaf saaf kaha gaya he ki ucchayog ko bharat ke is patrkaar kii aatanki netaa hafiz said se mulaakaat ke bare main koi jaankaree nahin thi
 He said, 'the report said that the High Commission was not aware that Vedic Hafiz was going to meet Saeed, so there was no question of the High Commission helping this meeting
 ’videsh mantri ne kaha ki vah pehle bhi sadan main kah chuki hai ki vaidic kii said se mulaakaat kaa yaa unki pakistan yatra kaa bharat sarkaar se dur dur tak lenaa dena nahin he
 Earlier, after the Question Hour was over in the House, members of Congress, NCP, RJD and CPM created a ruckus on the issue and demanded that the Foreign Minister come to the House and clarify that Vedic and Hafiz Saeed met in Pakistan
 What has been the role of the Indian High Commission

 Praveen Togadia suddenly goes missing on Monday morning
 kai ghante ke baad togadiya der raat behoshee kii haalat main paae jate hai, jiske baad unhen shahibagh ilaake ke chudamani aspataal main bhartee karaayaa gaya he
 The Gujarat and Rajasthan police had been looking for him since morning
 lekin isse pehle hi togadiya kii gumshudagi kii khabar se siyasat main hadakamp much jaataa he
 Many questions arise with Praveen Togadia's disappearance
 kyonki in dinon unke khilaaf ek ke baad ek warrant lagaataar jari ho rahe hai
 Then on Tuesday, Togadia talks to the media himself and accuses him of conspiracy
 praveen togadiya kii gumshudagi ke din somvaar ko hi unke khilaafrajasthan police 10 saal puranemaamle main giraftaar kaa warrant lekar pahunchati he
 But Togadia does not meet, it is learned that he has gone alone in an auto
 aise main togadiya ke bina giraftaar kiye hi rajasthan police waapas ravaanaa ho jaati he
 10 year old case, tell us that Rajasthan police went to arrest on Monday in the case against Praveen Togadia, he is 10 years old
 10 saal pehle rajasthan main teen hindu yuvakon kii hatya ke baad dow togadiya vahaan pahunche the
 He was not allowed by the administration to do the program
 iske baavjood togadiya ne logon ko sambodhit kiya tha
 a non-bailable warrant was issued against him in the same case, under which Rajasthan Police reached Ahmedabad to arrest him
 par police ke pahunchane se pehle hi togadiya gumshudagi khabar ai, bagaiyr giraftaar ke police waapas laut gai
 Significantly, last week, a non-bailable warrant was issued against Pravin Togadia through the Metropolitan Court of Gujarat
 jiske baad unhone court main pesh hue or unhen jamaanat milane ke baad reeha hue
 This case is also 21 years old
 gujarat sarkaar ke mantri rahe atmaram kii pitayee kaa he
 Questions are being raised on Monday due to the warrant issued against him and the sequence of events
 aakhir kya vajah he ki togadiya ke khilaaf kanoonee kaarywahi hone lagi he
 When Togadia had appeared in the court in a 21-year-old case, a political conspiracy was being carried out against him
 jab unase poocha gaya ki koun shadyantra kar rahaa he to unhone kaha tha ki jo log nahin chaahate hai ki ramamandir bane or wo log nahin chaahate hai ki ham berogari, muft shiksha ke khilaaf aawaaj uthaaen
 Togadia had also raised the question as to why he was not given summons when he stays in Ahmedabad
 sidhaa warrant kaise jari kiya gaya
 In such a situation, the question is also arising that after all these years why action against Togadia is intensifying, is it not at the behest of anyone
 jaankaron ki maane to togadiya gujarat chunaav main jamkar sarkaar ke khilaaf kisaanon ke mudde, berojgaare ke muddon ko lekar bol rahe the
 In Vesay, this action against him is not the result of a rift in the relations between the BJP and him
 jald hi aapako vaahan companiyaan number plate lagi kaaren hi bechengi
 After this, you will not have to spend money separately to put a number plate
 kyonki is par aane vaale kharch ko car kii keemat main hi shaamil kiya jayega
 Road Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari gave this information
 gadakari ne bataaya ki abavaahan nirmaatanumber plate lagaakar denge
 The numbering work on these will be done by the machine later
 unhone bataaya ki upabhoktaaon ko raahat dene ke liye plate kii keemat bhi car ke kul daam main shaamil kii jaaegi
 Let us know that at present, number plates are taken from different agencies in different states
 unhone kaha ki ek baar yah vyavastha aa gai, uske baad puure desh main ek hi tarah kii vyavastha ho sakegi
 He said that at present, the state plate is purchased by the states, it is available from 800 to 40 thousand rupees
 maujuuda vyavastha ke tahat number plate yaa license plate sambandhit rajya ke jila stareey kshetreey parivahan karyaalay se lee jaati he
 After the arrival of this system, the vehicle owner will not have to visit these offices
 is dauraan unhone vaahanon kii suraksha ko lekar bhi kade kadam uthaane kii baat kahi
 He said that there would be no compromise on security
 chaahe sastevahan hon yaa lagjriv esayuvi kaaren, suraksha maanak sabhi ke liye samaan honge
 At the same time, he also reiterated not to compromise on the pollution front
 unhone kaha ki pradooshan kam karne ke liye bhi kade kadam uthaae jaaenge or na hi isko lekar uthaae kadamon ko lagu karne main koi kotahi barti jaaegi
 Mother Kali is a formidable form of Adi Shakti Jagdamba
 inaki upasna kaa alag hi mahatv he
 It is said that Goddess Maa had taken this exterminator incarnation only to suppress the evil and the demons
 devi kaa saatvaan swaroop hai maa kaalaratri
 The color of Mankalratri is black and they are trinetradhari
 maa kaalaratri ke gale main kadakati bijli kii adbhut maala he
 He has a fork and fork in his hands and his vehicle is 'donkey'
 maankalaratri ko shubhankaribhi kehete hai
 Mother Kalratri is the mother who gives rise to fear in the heart of the evil and sinners prevailing in the world
 maa kaali shakti sampradaay kii pramukh devi hai
 She is also called the goddess of death of the wicked
 inke swaroop se judi ek kahani bahut prachlit he
 
 
 Story related to Maa Kalratrisi
 
 
 asuron ke raja raktbeej kaa vadh karne ke liye devi durga ne kaalaratri kaa avatar liya tha
 Mother Kali was constantly destroying and destroying
 inke bhayankar swaroop or utapaat se sristi main haahaakaar much gaya tha
 In such a situation, the power to stop the mother Kali as a direct face was not there even in Adidev Mahadev
 tabhi devataaon ke anurodh par mahakali ke krodh ko shant karne ke liye shiv ne unki raah main letne kii yukti lagaai thi, taaki charachar brahmand ke swami or apane pati parameshwar ko apane paanv ke neeche paakar devi shant hon or apane mul rup main waapas aaen
 The greatest form of the glory of Mother Kali is of the Mahavidyas
 das mahavidhyaon ke swarupon main 'maa kaali' pratham sthaan par hai
 Mother Kali Karang turned black at the time of shumbha-nishumbh's slaughter
 maa kaali ke sharir se nikle tej punj se unka rang kaala ho gaya
 Their worship completely eliminates the effects of enemy, fear, accident and tantra-mantra
 maa kaali apane bhakton kii raksha karte hue unhen aarogy kaa vardaan detii hai
 Saturn is considered to be related to the planet Saturn in Shanti Jyotish
 aisi manyata he ki shani kii samasya main inaki puja karnaa adbhut parinaam detaa he
 The worship of Maa Kalratri reduces the effect of Shani and does not affect the half-and-half
 maa kaali kii pujake niyamma kaaliki puja do prakaar se hoti he
 First general worship and second tantra worship
 saamaanya puja koi bhi kar saktaa he, lekin tantra puja bina guru ke sangrakshan or nirdeshon ke nahin kii ja sakati
 Midnight is the best time to worship Maa Kali
 inaki upasna main laal or kaali vastuon kaa vishesh mahatv hota he
 Maa Kaliki is worshiped to pacify enemies and opponents
 kisi galat uddeshy se maa kaali kii upasna katai nahin kerani chahie
 Meditation of Maa Kali is more effective than chanting the mantra
 to aap bhi in niyamon ko dhyaan main rakhkar hi shakti ke is swaroop kii aradhana kiijie auki satkarm kii raah par chalane kii koshish kiijie
 Because the more you get away from evil, the closer you will become to mother Kali
 phir sansar kii har vipatti se aapaki suraksha karengi maa kaali

 Azim Premji's statement came shortly after the remarks of the country's leading industrialist Ratan Tata in which Tata said that it would be unfair to blame Prime Minister Singh for the current economic concerns of the country
 premaji ne kaha, ‘yah kahana mushkil he ki sudhaar prakriya kaise aage badhegi
 Manmohan Singh has taken over the responsibility of the Prime Minister as well as the Finance Ministry
 isaliye ab hamen ummid rakhni chaiye or unhen iske liye upyukt samay diya janaa chaiye
 Premji said that more important than the policy efforts is that the government should implement the various issues involved in the existing policies in a planned manner
 unhone kaha, ‘dhanchaagat kshetra kii pariyojna ho yaa phir sarkari pariyojna, jo pariyojnayen chal rahi hai or jinamein vistaar kii aavashyaktaa he, sarkaar ko un vyapak kshetron par dhyaan dene kii aavashyaktaa he jinpar amal hona he or jinpar nirnay liya ja chukaa he
 This work can be done, because it is an important responsibility of the government
 ’pichley saptaah tata ne twit kiya tha ki desh ke aarthik sudhaaron ke aade aane vaale samasyaon ke liye keval pradhanmantri ko dosha diya janaa galat hoga
 Standing in support of Singh, Tata said, 'it is very unfortunate and sad that during the last few months the opposition, media, some citizens and even some members of the party in the ruling party have mercilessly spoken about our Prime Minister and written
 singh jo ki varsh 1991 main shuru huye aarthik sudhaaron ke janak rahe hai or jisase desh ko aarthik samruddhi tathaa antarrashtriya str par nai pahchaan mili he

 darasal unhone bhartiya shiksha vyavstha ke bare main apni raay jaahir kii he
 He has said that the Indian education system rests on education but does not promote creativity
 ek intervyuu main wajaniek ne kaha he, ‘aap kitne talented hai? agar aap ejeeniyar hai yaa emb hai to aap apni degree par ithlie, lekin khud se puuchhie ki aap main kitne creative hai
 In an interview to ET, he has also said that he does not expect that companies like Google, Facebook and Apple in India can be ready
 wajaniek ke mutabit bharat main udhaaharan ke taur par ek badi tech company infosis he or wo bhi innovative nahin he
 He has also expressed the hope that Infosys cannot be in the race of global tech giants at the moment
 unhone sawaalon kaa jawaab dete hue yah bhi raay di he ki bhartiya ke paas creativity kii kami he or unhen is tarah ke kariyar ke liye badhaava bhi nahin diya jaataa he
 He said, 'success here means academic excellence, studies, learning, good jobs and living a better life
 creativity tab khatm ho jaati he jab aapkaa bihavier ko predict karnaa aasaan ho jaataa he sab ek jaise ho jate hai
 Look at a small country like New Zealand where there are writers, singers, sportspersons and it's a different world ' kendriya madhyamik shiksha board (CBSE) kii 12veen pariksha 2 march se shuru ho gai he
 The first paper was English, about which most students believed that the paper was easy
 vahiin, students ke saath shikshakon kaa bhi maananaa he ki ausat bacchon ke hisaab se yah paper taiyaar kiya gaya tha
 Children who had prepared well in English can score well in English examination
 zyaadaatar students ne kaha ki reeding section ko banane main unhen zyada samay laga
 The questions from the textbook were general and the paper was prepared like a mock test
 bharat main ek taraf khadyann kaa bhandar jarurat se kahin zyada he, to duusari taraf daal or tilhan (khaadya tel) kii baari kami he
 This is a kind of paradox
 daal or khaadya tel ke liye bharosemand kharidari vyastha lagu kar is virodhabhas ko dur kiya ja saktaa he
 The National Cooperative Agricultural Marketing Association of India (NAFED) has not been able to do its basic work i
e

 NAFED needs immediate restructuring so that it can perform its original work
 isse kisaan daal or tilhan kii kheti kii ore aakarshith honge
 "the Agricultural Costs and Prices Commission (CACP) of the Ministry of Agriculture, while releasing its report for the Kharif crop season 2015-16, made this recommendation on 27 March this year
 iske ek pakhwaade baad april main mausam vibhaag ne desh main saamaanya se kam barish hone kaa anumaan jataa diya, jo ant main sahi sabit bhi hua
 Which also meant that for the second consecutive year the pulses crop could be weak
 iske baad 1 may ko bangaluru khadyann or daal thok vyapaaree association ne pradhanmantri narendra modi ko patr likhakar ek or bade khatre kii taraf aagaah kiya, ''hujur, kuch badi companiyaan bade paimaane par daalon kaa aayaat kar inhen myanmar, africa or mumbai ke apane godaamon main jamaa kar rahi hai
 These companies hold 80 percent of the imported pulses this year
 desh main daalon kii kami kaa phayda uthaakar in companiyon ne ab tak keemton main 40 se 50 fisadi kaa oochaal laa diya he
 The way they have eliminated the stock limit from the Maharashtra government, their strength can be gauged from this
 "ye teen tathy arhar kii daal ke doharaa shatak maarane kii tej prakriya ke alag-alag pahaluon kii vyakhya karte hai
 The CACP report states that not only are the yields of oil and pulses low in the country, but farmers are also turning their backs towards it
 bharat daalon kaa sabase bada utpaadak hone ke saath hi inkaa sabase bada bazaar he or khaane main daal kaa sabase zyada upyog yaheen hota he
 In such a situation, the shortage of 30 to 40 lakh tonnes of pulses in the country every year has to be met through imports
 is saal fasal kharaab hone se yah kami 50 se 60 lakh ton kii ho gai
 On the other hand, the forecast of weak monsoon gave rise to the feeling of inflation before the real crisis
 bangaluru khadyann association ke adhyaksh ramesh chandra lahoti kehete hai, ''in andeshon ke bich antarrashtriya bazaar samaj gaya ki ab bharat se maang badhegi
 In such a situation, prices started increasing already
 badi companiyon ne daal niryaat karne vaale deshon se daal kharid kar stock kar lee ki jab bharat kharidega to ve munafa kamaayenge
 "according to him, the problem is not so much that there is a shortage of pulses in the country, the problem is that as soon as the tender for the purchase of pulses from the Government of India comes, the pulses start becoming expensive abroad
 gaur talab he ki duniyabar main khaadya padaarthon kii keemton main giravat kaa rukh hone ke baavjood daalon kii keemton main antarrashtriya bazaar main teji aa rahi he
 When there was a sugar crisis in India in 2008, even after the demand from India, the price of sugar in the foreign market was also increasing
 sarkari kharid ke prastaav ke saath hi bazaar kii keemten badaae kii beemaari itani puraani he ki apane pradhanmantritv kaal main pandit jawaharlal nehru ne 1 agast, 1957 ko mukhyamantriyon ko baqayada patr likhakar samajhaayaa, ''yah maani hui baat he ki agar sarkaar khule bazaar se kharidari karne jaati he to keemten chadh jaati hai
 The only other solution is to get reasonable prices for government procurement of food and other essential items
 " udaarikaran ke jamaane main to sarkaar ke paas yah doosraa vikalp bhi nahin he
 That is, the country has now reached a situation where the price of pulses has increased in both the situation and not buying
 kalabazari kaa shacolekin kya beemaari ko badaae se pehle hi roka ja saktaa tha? krishi visheshgy devendra sharma kii daleel he, ''sarkaar ab jaakar stock limit laga rahi he, jamaakhoron par chaape maar rahi he
 If this work is Rs 100 of lentils
 kilo ke str par hi kar liya jaataa to halaat itane kharaab nahin hote
 "on the other hand, Congress leader Anand Sharma attacks the central government," take the figures and see that there is a shortage of 40 to 50 lakh tons of pulses in the country every year
 is saal jaanate hue ki kami badi he, mahaj 6 lakh ton kaa aayaat kiya gaya, jabaki vah 50 lakh ton hona chahie tha
 This has increased black marketing
 iske liye centre sarkaar jikvamedaar he
 "but the Center is also in an aggressive posture after pulses have become an issue in Bihar elections

 But the state governments did not take advantage of it
 " idhar dilli main vitt mantri arun jetali ke netritv main puri sarkaar hi is mudde se juujhati dikh rahi he
 Jaitley is blaming the decline in production for inflation rather than any kind of flaw of the government
 saath hi ve yah bhi kah rahe hai ki rajya sarkarein chapa maarane ke kaam main sahyog nahin kar rahi hai
 Failed policy decisions, but there is definitely some shortcoming in the government's effort
 siesipi kii report main arhar kii daal ke mahangaa hone kii raftar par najar daalen to saaf dikhataa he ki april 2014 tak arhar main mahangaai dar nakaaratmak thi
 That is, till the end of Manmohan Singh government's term, the prices of arhar pulses were decreasing
 vahiin may 2014 yani narendra modi ke pradhanmantri banane ke baad se arhar main mudrasphiti kii dar nakaaratmak jone se nikalakar abhi tak badhati hi ja rahi he
 It is not that the Modi government has not tried to control the situation
 centre ne rajya sarkaron ko apiemasi annt khatm karne kii salaah di
 The reasoning behind this was that now the farmers are able to sell the crop only in the marked mandis and they also have to pay tax
 agar kisaan ke paas kisi ko bhi upaj bechney kii chhot hogi to use behatar daam milegaa or nijee kshetra ke liye is kaarobaar ke daravaaje khul jaaenge
 In February 2014, Jaitley appealed to the states to phase out fruits and vegetables from the APMC Act
 dilli or uttarakhand jaise rajyon ne hi unki baat maani
 However, the way pulses are expensive in Delhi, it does not seem that this change would have a big impact
 doosraa kaam centre sarkaar ne mulya stharikaran kosh banane kaa kiya, jiskaa zikr paswan kar rahe hai
 But the government was able to establish this fund on 26 March 2015
 or us samay iskaa mul makasad aalu or pyaaj jaisi subjiyon ke daam sthir banaae rakhana tha
 But how effective this fund was, it cost 80 onions
 kilo tak pahunchane ke halaat ne saaf kar diya
 Now that pulses have hit the head, once the government is talking about reducing their prices with the help of this fund, here too the failure has come

 madhepura saansad or jan adhikaar party ke sangrakshakapappu yadavanemujaffarpurbalika grih orpatnashelter home kii jaanch ko lekar sawaal uthaae hai
 Yadav said in Patna that the CBI is investigating the Muzaffarpur girls' home, but no action has been taken nor any raids have been conducted on the social welfare officials involved
 unhone patna shelter home ko mrityu lok kehete hue kaha ki manisha dayaal or adhikariyon or netaaon ke sambandh ko saarvajanik karnaa chahie
 Pappu Yadav raised 10 questions on the investigation 1
 maamalamujaffarpurake mahapaap kaa ho yaa phir patna ke aasraa home ke mrityu-lok kaa, aakhir kya kaaran he ki iske janmdata samaaj kalyaan vibhaag ke bade adhikariyon ke khilaaf ab tak karrwai nahin ho rahi he
 Clearly, many IAS officers Brajesh Thakur and Manisha Dayalke are involved in the gang, so is the raid being delayed to protect them and erase evidence of disturbances from files
 sibiai or patna police samaaj kalyaan vibhaag main red aakhir kab daalegi?2
 Manju Verma has opened his mouth
 vah khule taur par bihar ke nagar vikaas mantri suresh sharma kaa naam le rahi he
 Varma's husband Chandrashekhar Verma has been the companion of Mahapapi Brajesh Thakur, so everyone is also aware of Suresh Sharma
 vaise bhi sharma ke kisse mujffarpur se bengal tak mashhoor rahe hai
 Then when will Nitish Kumar and Sushil Kumar Modi decide about Suresh Sharma? CBI should also take immediate action
 3
 Nitish Kumar is waiting for which day to take action against the officials of the Information and Public Relations Department, who got Brajesh Thakur from the government advertisements? Now the pictures of Madam of the elder sir who were in this department with Manisha Dayal are also viral
 bihar jawaab maangata he
 4
 patna aasraa home, jise manisha dayaal or chirantan kumaar ne mrityulok bana diya tha
 It seems that the investigation of Patna Police is also getting entangled in the Mayalok of Manisha Dayal
 teen dinon kii poochtacha main patna police na to is racket main shaamil duusari badi machhliyon ko pakad saki he or na manisha dayaal kii neeli duniya ko beparda kar saki he
 The MP has demanded that the mobile CDR be immediately made public and action should be taken against all those involved in the business of intoxicants
 ham sibiai jaanch ko lekar patna hoicourt main rit yachika daayar karenge
 5
 manisha dayaal ko samaaj kalyaan vibhaag main diarect entry dilaane vaale iees diarector sunil kumaar kii pahchaan saaf he
 Yet why action is being delayed against them
 jaankaree he ki is deree kaa phayda uthaakar sunil kumaar bhrasht tareeke se arjeet kii gai behisaab sampatti ko surakshit karne main laga hua he
 6
 bihar ke har ghotaale main iees esaem raju kaa naam aa hi jaataa he
 Apart from the scams in the Mahadalit Mission, how many scams have been named in Bihar
 ab manisha dayaal se bhi conection jud rahaa he to phir baar-baar ghotaalaa karne vaale esaem raju ke khilaaf bihar kii jaanch agenciyaan itnaa kamjor cese kyon taiyaar karti he ki bagaiyr jail gaye court se relif mil jaati he
 The investigative agency does not even make an arrest until relief is found
 raju kii leadership main bihar main bahut bada plantesan ghotaalaa bhi hua he
 CM Nitish Kumar get it thoroughly investigated
 7
 After all, what is the reason that the names of Manisha Dayal and Chirantan Kumar's president of the sinner organization are not being opened
 gavarning body ke sadasyon ko bhi nahin bataaya ja rahaa
 All are participants in the sins of the dead of Asra Home
 to kya ye itane bade naam hai ki bihar main bhuuchaal aa jane kaa dar he, so ise chhupaakar police karrwai se bachaaya ja rahaa he?8
 According to Pappu Yadav, Manisha Dayal's spicy world had plenty of outings
 dilli-mumbai conection bad gaya tha
 Check out Manisha Dayal's tour of the last three years through air tickets
 saath aane-jane waalon kii bhi pahchaan ho, kai chehre baar-baar milenge
 9
 yadav ke mutabik pakki khabar he ki remand main poochtacha ke dauraan jab kuch samay ke liye manisha dayaal kaa mobile kholaa gaya, tab bhi teji se bade-bade phone aane lage
 There should be no surprise in this investigation that where Manisha Dayal used to go to late night parties and whom she was chatting with late at night
 10
 Along with the Social Welfare Department, investigation of the Department of art-culture and Tourism is also necessary
 patna se lekar videshon tak ke kai aayojan main khaas gang ko bihar sarkaar kii ore se karodon kii raashi di gai he

 ham jaise log lagaataar haar rahe hai
 i could not understand Prashant
 yahi guzarish kar laut aayaa ki ek baar apane vichaaron par dobaaraa sochna
 Read a few more books, but he felt certain that what he knows is right
 vahi antim he
 After all, who would have told all these things to Prashant? Will anyone else come between these young people long before the Monday night crowd? Taking the incomplete books and things of history? Who are those people who leave youngsters like Prashanth alone to get seduced by such people? He himself went to a foreign university to submit his phd on the history of India and loot accolades
 ham samaj nahin rahe hai
 We are unable to explain

 lautate vakt pataa nahin kyon aisa laga ki ek or laash ke saath laut rahaa hum
 People were saying that thousands of people arrived shortly after the announcement of the loudspeaker
 magar wo koun the yah koi nahin bataa rahaa
 Everyone is trying to save each other
 yah sawaal poochne par ki wo chaar log koun the sab chup ho jate hai
 Nobody knew those four five boys when they asked this question, so how did such a crowd come up at their behest, they all go silent
 ab sab apane ladakon ko biimaar bataa rahe hai
 People came from another village
 hazaron log ek gali main to samaa nahin sakate
 Must have spread across the village
 tab bhi kisi ne unhen nahin dekha
 Those who are caught are being described as innocent
 jaanch or adaalat ke faisale ke baad hi kisi ko doshi mana janaa chahie lekin hinsa ke baad jis tarah se puraa gaanv saamaanya ho gaya he usase lagata nahin ki police kabhi us bheed ko benaqaab kar paaegi
 When have the police been able to do so? maance gaay kaa tha yaa bakrii kaa forencik jaanch se pataa chal bhi gaya to kya hoga
 The public has heard the decision
 akhlaaq ko kuchal kuchal kar maar chuki he
 How can the dear daughter of Akhlaq forget the sight of the father being killed in front of his eyes
 uski budhi maa kii ankhon par bhi logon ne maaraa he
 There are deep marks of injury
 dadri kii ghatana kisi videsh yatra kii shoharat yaa chunavi reliyon kii tukbandi main gum ho jaaegi
 But those who can think should think
 aisa kya ho gaya he ki ham aaj ke naujavaanon ko samajha nahin paa rahe hai
 The elderly say that even though there was beef, the task of punishing the police was
 noujvaan sidhe bhaavana ke sawaal par aa jate hai
 The way they react to the matter of emotion clearly shows that it is the result of some preparation
 kisi ne unke dimaag main zehar bhar diya he
 They are also ignoring the Prime Minister's point that communalism is poison
 mere saath selfi khinchane aayaa prashanth jaldi hi taish main aa gaya
 Beautiful young man and engineer by profession
 prashanth ne chhutate hi kaha ki kisi ko kisi kii bhaavana se khilne kaa haq nahin he
 Our colleague Ravish Ranjan intermittently said that people do not talk properly to the parents and kill someone on the question of emotion
 acha ladkaa laga prashanth par laga ki use is maut par koi afsos nahin he
 On the contrary, when the partition was said that Hindus would stay here and in Muslim Pakistan, why did Gandhi and Nehru stop Muslims in India

 One should be considered guilty only after investigation and court decision, but the way the whole village has become normal after the violence, it is unlikely that the police will ever be able to expose the mob
 vaise police kab kar pai he
 What would happen if the meat was of the cow or if the goat came to know by forensic examination
 janata kii bheed to faisalaa suna chuki he
 Akhlaq has been crushed to death
 akhlaaq kii dulaari beti apni ankhon ke saamne baap ke maare jane kaa manzar kaise bhul sakati he
 People have also hit his old mother's eyes
 chot ke gahare nishaan hai
 Dadri incident will be lost in the fame of any foreign trip or rhyme of election rallies
 lekin jo soch sakate hai unhen sochna chahie
 What has happened that we are unable to explain to the youth of today
 buzurg kehete hai ki gau maance tha tab bhi sajaa dene kaa kaam police kaa tha
 Youngsters come directly to the question of emotion
 ve jis tarah se bhaavana kii baat par riect karte hai usase saaf pataa chalata he ki yah kisi taiyaari kaa nateeja he
 Someone has poisoned his mind
 ve pradhanmantri kii baat ko bhi ansuna kar rahe hai ki sampradayikta zehar he
 Prashant came to take selfie with me soon

 Prashant immediately said that no one has the right to play with anyone's feelings
 hamaare sahyogi raveesh ranjan ne tokate hue kaha ki maa baap se to log thik se baat nahin karte or bhaavana ke sawaal par kisi ko maar dete hai
 Good boy Prashant felt that he had no regrets over this death
 ulta kehane laga ki jab bantwaaraa ho gaya tha ki hindu yahaan rahenge or muslim pakistan main to gandhi or nehru ne musalamaanon ko bharat main kyon roka
 i was horrified at this
 ye wo baat he jisase sampradayikta kii kadaahi main chhaunk padati he
 The comments prashanth ke saath khub garma garam bahes hui lekin main haar gaya
 People like us are constantly losing
 prashanth ko main nahin samajha paaya
 He returned requesting that to reconsider his thoughts once

 That is the last

 President Obama has shown keen interest in the issue of let terrorists Headley and Rana arrested in America
 unhone bharosa dilaayaa he ki ve khud is maamle main aage badhkar bharat ko puraa sahyog dilaayenge
 National Security Advisor MK Narayanan said that Obama himself is watching the case
 unhone bataaya ki ek hafte ke bheetar epabiai rana or hedli se mili tamaam jaankariyaan bharat ko muhaiyaa karaayegi
 The Indian agency will be able to interrogate Headley and Rana after the legal hurdles are removed
 kendriya mantri uma bharti ne chunaav ladgaye se manaa kiya to sabhi kii nazren jhaansi loksabhaa seat par aakar tik gayi
 Speculations are still going on about who will be the candidate from this seat, but among the names that are coming out, one of the names of the defected candidate is also present after the bjp's local unit
 mana ja rahaa he ki khud uma bharti us naam ko aage badha raheen hai jo kabhi mayawati or sonia gandhi ko pradhanmantri banane ko lekar naare buland karata rahaa he
 This is the name of Gangacharan Rajput
 gangacharan haal hi main bhaajapa main shaamil hue hai
 He was earlier in the BSP
 congress main bhi gangacharan ne lambaa vakt guzaara he
 Jhansi seat is considered to be the most important seat of Bundelkhand, so everyone's eyes are also on this seat
 vah isliye bhi kyonki congress yah seat choti party rashtriya jan adhikaar party ke liye pehle hi chhod chuki he
 This enraged the local unit of the Congress organization
 ab bhaajapa bhi congress kii raah par chalati dikhaai de rahi he
 Actually, Jhansi Lalitpur Lok Sabha seat was with the Congress till 2014
 yahaan se congress netaa pradeep jain aditya 2009 main chunaav jitkar kendra main mantri banaae gaye the
 The BJP never won this seat after 1998
 yahaan 1999 main congress, 2004 main sapa or phir 2009 main congress ne chunaav jeeta tha
 After this, the BJP won back its lost seat by betting on a big leader like Uma Bharti
 uttar pradesh ke bundelkhand kii sabhi chaar siton par bhaajapa ne jeet darj kii thi
 Though it can also be considered as the result of the sweeping victory of the Modi wave, but now the Lok Sabha elections are over and the speculation has started on what the political equations will be in Bundelkhand
 sabase mahatvapurn ghamaasan jhaansi loksabhaa seat ko lekar he
 That is because from here MP and Union Minister Uma Bharti has announced not to contest elections
 unhone party adhyaksh amit shah ko iske sandarbh main patr likhakar chunaav nahin ladgaye kaa aagrah kiya he
 The number of ticket contenders has increased considerably after Uma Bharti's announcement of not contesting the elections, but there are some names on which people may be surprised
 jo log bhaajapa se is seat par ummidavaar banaae ja sakate hai unamem jhaansi sadar seat se vidhayak ravi sharma, babina vidhayak rajeev singh parichha, lalitpur vidhayak ramratan kushvaha, hargovind kushvaha, rabindra shukla or sanjeev shrangirishi or vandana pathak kaa naam shaamil hai
 Along with this, the names of Ganga Charan Rajput and Garautha MLA Jawahar Lal Rajput are also in the discussions as candidates of Lodh caste
 mana ja rahaa he ki bundelkhand main jaateey santulan ke hisaab se banda se brahman, hamirpur se thakur, jalon se dalit or jhaansi se lodh pratyaashee ko mauka diya gaya tha
 This equation also worked and the BJP won all the seats from here
 jhaansi seat se uma bharti ab chunaav nahin ladengi to yahaan se bhaajapa ummidavaar koun hoga
 The name that has been emerging after the last few days is shocking
 jhaansi seat se gangacharan rajput ko pratyaashee banaaya ja saktaa he
 Gangacharan is an out-of-the-box candidate, so the local BJP unit is stunned by the fact that he is given tickets
 bhaajapa se tikat maang rahe ravi sharma khud gangacharan ke bahrihone kii baat kahkar party ko nuksaan hone kaa andeshaa jataa chuke hai
 Ganga Charan's name is shocking, says senior journalist Raghuveer Sharma
 bhajapaake adhikansh padaadhikari or janpratinidhi is is par sahamat nahin hai
 If Gangacharan gets a ticket, the party is likely to suffer a big loss
 raghuveer kehete hai, yadi party ko yahaan obisi lodh jati se pratyaashee kii talash he tab bhi bahut chehre bhaajapa ke paas hai, unamem gangacharan se zyada behatar cheharaa garautha vidhayak jawahar laal rajput kaa bhi he
 Jawahar's farmer image makes him better than other candidates
 mana ja rahaa he ki pichley dinon bhaajapa padaadhikariyon kii baithak main bhi yah saaf kiya ja chukaa he ki uma bharti ko chhodir kisi bahari ko yahaan sweekaar nahin karenge
 a BJP leader even goes so far as to say, Ganga Charan Rajput was born in Jalaun and prepared his political land in Hamirpur Mahoba
 vah jhaansi kyon aana chaahate hai
 Any external candidate contesting from Jhansi will hurt
 dalbadalu par kyon daav lagaana chaahegi bhaajapabaspa se bhaajapa main shaamil hue ganga charan rajput ab tak teen baar hamirpur se saansad rah chuke hai
 He won elections on a Janata Dal ticket in 1989, while in 1996 and 1998, he became an MP from BJP to Hamirpur
 saal 2004 main congress kii lahar main behate hue rajput congressi main shaamil ho gaye
 After this, he rode on the BSP elephant in 2009
 ab vah phir bhaajapa main ghus aae hai
 Gangacharan is believed to be close to Union Minister Uma Bharti
 vah jhansise tikat maang rahe hai or unhone iske liye uma bharti ko manaa liya he
 There is a famous story about former MP Ganga Charan Rajput that when Sonia Gandhi turned down the PM position on May 18, 2004, she used a revolver at the temple to shoot herself
 yah puraa vakya dilli main sonia gandhi ke ghar ke baahar hua tha
 The revolver was found empty during investigation
 jiske baad unka naatak saarvajanik ho gaya tha
 Congress lost the Jhansi Jhansi Lok Sabha seat without contesting the election history of the Congress has been better than other parties
 yahaan pandrah baar hue chunaav main nau baar congress ne jeet darj kii he
 BJP has won elections five times and SP only once
 aise main congress ne is seat ko achaanak se chote dal rashtriya jan adhikaar party ke hisse main daal diya
 Babusinh Kushwaha, the head of this party, may contest from Jhansi
 congressi is baat se khush nahin hai
 Now BJP can also take the candidate from outside and walk on the lines of Congress
 iskaa bhi virodh hone kii puri sambhaavna he

 darasal, pradesh chunaav ayog ne vidhansabha chunaav ke maddenjar poster jari karke votaron se apana vot daalane poling booth tak jarur jane kii apil kii
 There is no evil in this intention of the Commission, but the words that the Commission has used in the poster create the illusion that it is against the current Congress Government of Rajasthan
 poster main ek aadmi apane ghar par bade aaraam se tivi dekh rahaa he
 The poster reads: 'will you keep whipping the sitting government or will you vote and choose the government of your choice'? However, according to Rajasthan Chief Electoral Officer Ashok Jain nothing wrong has been written in the poster
 jab unase yah poocha gaya ki kya isse yah sandesh nahin ja rahaa he ki votaron se sarkaar badalane kii apil kii ja rahi he, to unhone kaha ki isamen likhi baton kaa galat matlab mat nikaaliye, har kisi ko apni pasand kii sarkaar chunane kaa haq he
 However, there does not seem to be any possibility of a chaos regarding the poster

 The bench said in its judgment on Wednesday, "life experiences are more authentic than the logic of law
 hamaara anubhav hamen bataata he ki jawan aapas main baatcheet karte samay sadak chhap bhashaa kaa istemaal karte hai or mukt rup se gaaliyon ke saath sawaal karte hai
 "this order of the court relates to the incident which took place on December 16, 2002, in which Krishna Pal Singh had an altercation with RL Pandit, a sub-inspector
 pandit siaisef ikai iosi, panipat ke shift prabharee the
 Singh had alleged that Pandit started a quarrel and slapped him, while Pandit alleged that Singh abused and attacked him
 ghatana kii praarambhik jaanch ke baad singh ko 17 disambar, 2002 ko tatkaal prabhaav se nilambit kar diya gaya tha
 Singh told the inquiry committee on 16 December 2002 that his health was not well and when his duty ended at 9 pm and no other jawan was replaced, he contacted Pandit over the phone and demanded to know that he was on duty Why did not the other young man reach to redeem
 yachika ke anusaar, "pandit ne krishnapal se kaha tha ki unhone head consteble devendra kumaar se anurodh kiya he ki jab tak doosraa koi duty par nahin pahunch jaataa he, tab tak vah singh kii chaowkee kii nigaraanee karen

 Used profanity in " peeth ne kaha, "tabiyat thik na hone ke kaaran yachikakarta kaa man acha nahin tha or vah is tarah kii bhashaa bardaasht nahin kar sakaa, or iske kaaran vivaad shuru ho gaya or uske baad hathapayee hui

 com / 6xeio09wdx — Medhatithi (@ varunreddy01) October 28, 2017 Srikanth was injured during the Senior National Badminton Championships in Nagpur, after which he decided to rest for a week
 shrikant ne pitiai se kaha, 'main china open (14 se 19 november) se hat rahaa hum
 My muscles are stretched and doctors have advised me to rest for a week
 ' shrikant rashtriya championships ke final main eches pranay se haar gayi the
 He had been playing continuously since 18 October
 unhone kaha, 'main lagaataar khel rahaa hum
 So it got a little worse
 meri chot haftebhar main thik ho jaaegi
 However, the Badminton Association of India (BAI) said that it was a coincidence that Srikanth suffered an injury during the national championship, as the date for the event was announced after consulting top players
 biai ke mahasachiv anup nanrag ne kaha, 'yah kahana galat hoga ki rashtriya championships shrikant kii chot ke liye jimmedaar thi
 ' antarrashtriya cab sarvice ubar par dilli main to bain lag hi chukaa he, kai anya rajyon main bhi us par gaaj gir chuki he
 After the incident of rape with a female executive, the company's attitude was extremely embarrassing
 jaise-jaise jaanch hoti ja rahi he, uske bartaav or kaam ke tareeke par sawaal uthne lage hai
 It is now known that the company did not take any action on the earlier complaints
 driver kii vyaktigat jaanch-padtaal main usne jo udaseenta dikhaai, vah to akshamya he
 a terrible criminal remained part of his service without a license and the company slept
 shikayaton ke baavjood usne koi kadam nahin uthaaya
 Action should be taken against him in this case
 yah ek aapraadhik udaseenta kaa maamla tha or isamen kadi sajaa milani chahie
 But the question is not just this
 is ghatana ke baad sarkaar ne ubar hi nahin, kai or cab sarvice par turant bain laga diya
 Now it is a matter of great debate
 kya kisi aparaadh ke baad is tarah kii tamaam seva par hi pratibandh laga diya janaa uchit he? kya sarkaar kii pratikriya kuch zyada talkh nahin he? kya aisa kar dene se kanoon-vyavastha kii girti hui sthiti sudhar jaaegi? in sawaalon kaa jawaab dhundhna hi hoga kyonki ye dirghakaalik hai
 Many times such incidents have happened in the railways, many times police personnel have also been involved in it
 to phir sawaal he ki kya railway ko bhi bain kar diya jayega? shaayad yah sawaal atishyokti se bharaa lage, lekin isamen kuch dam to he
 This case is undoubtedly very serious, but it cannot be treated in this way
 pehle to apradhi ko kadi sajaa dilaane kii vyavastha honi chahie or phir usase jude anya pahaluon kii bhi jaanch honi chahie
 What action should be taken against a cab service like Uber
 uske saath kanoon main chhidr hai unka bhi pataa lagaana chahie or unhen bharna chahie
 Whether the law was followed or not
 yah bhi bada sawaal he
 Weaknesses of the police system should also be taken care of and then some far-reaching decision should be taken
 is sharmnaak cond ke kaaran cab seva muhaiyaa karaane vaali companiyon par roak lagaakar kuch nahin milegaa
 More and more it will stop working, whose loss will be suffered only by the citizens suffering from transport problems
 achaanak neend se jagakar koi kadam uthaanaa mahangaa pad saktaa he
 There is also a question here, after the Nirbhaya incident, did we ban private buses? The truth is that with the strictness and strict action, fear can be created in the minds of those who commit such crimes
 cab sarvice chalaane waalon ke liye apane driveron ke tamaam kagajaat kii jaanch samay-samay par karavaate rahanaa anivaary hona chahie
 They should be kept under the purview of modern surveillance equipment
 aisa na karne waalon ke khilaaf sakht karrwai honi chahie na ki sabhi cab sevaaon par pratibandh lagaana chahie
