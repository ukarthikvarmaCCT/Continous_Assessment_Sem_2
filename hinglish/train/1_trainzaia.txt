 The Nepal government on Tuesday sought clarification from the operators within 24 hours, holding the transmission illegal
 darasal nepal main nayaa samvidhan lagu hone ke baad se madheshi uskaa virodh kar rahe hai

 'jo news plant kar rahe hai wo hamaare yahaan aayenge to juuta khaayenge
 This is the statement of India's Minister of State for Home Kiren Rijiju
 sanvaidhanik pad par baithe vyakti se nunatam ummid kii jaati he ki uski bhashaa shaleen ho
 Even if not decent, at least be democratic
 saamaanya log bhi sachet or achet rup se juuta maarane kii baat kar dete hai, isliye ki jatigat or saamanti bhashaai sanskaar ham sabamein ghul mil jate hai
 It should be that everyone should practice throughout their life to get rid of such rites
 lekin jab aap mantri pad par baithkar kisi ko chunauti dete hai ki hamaare yahaan aaenge to juuta khaayenge to ise vishesh rup se notice lenaa chahie, kyonki tab yah dhamkee bhi hoti he
 Can not say the rest of India, but because of coming from the North Indian linguistic culture, i can tell that slapping, feeding the shoe is the word of the feudal and racist gurus
 iskaa istemaal garib or jatigat dhaanche main kamazor logon ke kilaaf hota he
 Then it is also used to make each other feel stronger than each other
 magar purvottar se aane vaale ek mantri kii bhashaa main ye tatv kaise aa gaye
 Minister of State for Home Kiren Rijiju shares Rajnath Singh's hand in that ministry, whose job is to manage India's internal security system
 yah mantralay bhartiya police bal se lekar ardh suraksha balon kaa bhi ek tarah se sheersh mantralay he
 Regardless of the image, the police is the constitutional guardian in our neighborhood
 kam se kam ham police par sawaal uthaa sakate hai ki vah samvidhan or niyamon ke anusaar kyon nahin chal rahi he
 It is obvious that we will ask this question to the Chief Minister and the Chief of Police in the States and to the Union Home Minister and Minister of State for Home at the Center why the police system is bad
 ab is mantralay ke mukhiya kaa sahyogi hi police par bharosa na karke yah kahe ki jo log news plant kar rahe hai wo hamaare yahaan aaenge to juuta khaayenge to iskaa kya matlab he
 After all, does Rijiju's 'is here with us' supreme from the constitution system, where objection is dealt with not by law but by shoes
 'indian express' kii khabar se grih rajya mantri ko bilkul aapatti ho sakati he, lekin agar ve apane mantralay par hi bharosa jataate to cese karte
 Speaking of rules
 juuta khilaane ke liye aamantrit nahin karte
 The minister has two problems with this sentence
 unhen sanvaidhanik pad par rahete hue saamanti or jatigat shabdaawalee kaa prayog karne se bachanaa chahie
 Such a mistake happens to us all, it is better that we realize this mistake
 'hamaare yahaan aaenge juuta khaayenge', bolnaa mantri kaa nahin, mohalle kaa dada tip sunai detaa he
 Is the minister provoking a crowd in response to the news that he has here, where shoes will go when he goes
 duniya kii sarkarein, virdohi netaa news plant karaate hai
 The minister himself runs a news plant
 sutara bhi news plant karaate hai
 Any news can easily be declared a plant
 zaruri nahin ki plant kiya hua news galat hi ho, magar thik se check na karen to galat ho saktaa he
 Normally, it can be complained to the Press Council of India or to the editor of a newspaper, but when asked the question, did you feel right about feeding the shoe
 kya mantri ji 'indian express' ke patrkaar ko kah rahe hai ki unke yahaan gaya to juuta khilaayenge yaa use kah rahe hai ki jo news kaa sorce he
 So does Minister Rijiju know who is getting this news plant? agar pataa he to bhi kya uskaa tarika juuta he
 It is not only for Kiren Rijiju, but for me, myself, for all of us to work daily for liberation from feudal and caste-based words
 ummid karata hum ki mantri ji afsos zaahir karenge

 niyamon kii baat karte
 Do not invite shoes to feed
 mantri ji ke is vaakya se do samasyaayein hai
 They should refrain from using feudal and caste terms while holding a constitutional post
 aisi galati ham sabase ho jaati he, behatar he ki hamen is galati kaa ahsaas ho
 'we will come here to eat shoes', speaking is not of the minister, but the grandfather's type is heard
 kya mantri is khabar kii pratikriya main kisi bheed ko uksaa rahe hai jo unke yahaan kii he, jahaan jane par juute padenge
 Governments of the world, anti-leaders make news plants
 mantri khud news plant karaate hai

 Even if you know, is his method a shoe

 in chah rajyon main se tamilnadu or pashchim bengal main congress sabase pehle haari thi
 But in 1967, Nehru's daughter Indira Gandhi managed to win 283 seats out of the total 520 seats in the Lok Sabha
 aam chunaav main indira gandhi kii yah pehali jeet thi
 In 1969, Indira led some senior party leaders known as Congress (O) led by Morarji Desai
 isi daur main indira gandhi ne ‘garibi hataao' kaa naaraa diya jisane bhartiya matadaataaon ke ek bade hisse par asar kiya
 As a result, Indira Gandhi won 352 seats in the 1971 general election
 ab 2010 or 2014 ke daur kii baat karen jab samprag sarkaar vibhinn maamalon main bhrashtachar ke aaropon se jujh rahi thi
 Meanwhile, the BJP named Narendra Modi, the then Chief Minister of Gujarat, as its prime ministerial candidate in the 2014 general election

 The money has not yet been given to the state government

 bhartiya janata party ne rajya sabha ke liye umidvaaron kii har rajya se apni puri suchi jari kar di hai
 The most shocking name is that of Gopal Narayan Singh from Bihar

 The selection of Gopal Narayan Singh, who has lost the Assembly elections eight times, not once or twice, is certainly surprising to the people, ignoring his candidature
 modi ko rajya sabha kaa tikat na dene ke peeche nishchit rup se bihar main party kaa vah bada tabaka he jo modi se kisi na kisi kaaran se naaraaz rahata he
 This is the result of their campaign
 iske saath hi is nirnay se ek saaf sandesh gaya he ki pradhanmantri narendra modi or party adhyaksh amit shah philhal dilli main susheel modi kii sakriyata nahin chaahate
 There are many arguments behind this, the main one being the failure of most of the meetings held for review after the election defeat in Bihar
 kendriya netritv ne chunaav kii kaman sanbhali thi or rajya ke netaaon kii salaah ko nanandaaj kiya

 'murder-3' franchise is the film 'murder', the first two of which have been hits
 
 
 iskaa naam he 'murder-3', lekin isamen ek bhi murder nahin he
 
 
 It was seen as a murder mystery, but in the name of Mystery, there is only one mystery room in the film, which cannot be talked about much, because doing so will end the suspense
 
 
 sabase pehle aapako bataa duun ki 'murder-3' adopshan he spanish thriller 'da hiden phase' kii
 
 
 'murder-3' is Vikram, ie Randeep Hooda Struggling Photographer in South Africa, and he has a much-loved Mehbooba Khushboo, Aditi Rao Hydari, who is well-set
 
 
 magar jaise hi vikram ko fishan photography ke liye bharat se ofer miltaa he, vah india aa jate hai or apana sab kuch chhodkar unke saath aa jaati he khushboo
 
 
 Here, Khushboo starts suspecting Vikram and suddenly she disappears to a place from where she can keep an eye on Vikram
 
 
 garlfrend ke gaayab hone ke baad vikram kaa afaire shuru hota he nisha ke saath
 
 
 The comments film main sabhi kalakaaron ne acha abhinay kiya he, khaastaur par aditi raav hydari ne
 
 
 Emotional scenes are very good
 
 
 pehali film diarect kar rahe vishesh bhatta kaa nirdesan bhi acha he
 
 
 Simply, he could not execute a good concept on screen properly
 
 
 vaise, roshni ko dhund rahi police kii chaanbin bachakaani lagati he, kamare ke andar se agar koi danda se daravaaza pite or uske saamne khadey insaan ko awaz na sunai de, kuch atapata lagata he
 
 
 The film sometimes looks like murder mystery, sometimes horror
 
 
 'murder-3' main koi murder nahin he
 
 
 That is the blood of love and also the trust of the audience, hence my rating for 'murder-3' is 2
 5 star
 
 
 First of all, let me tell you that 'murder-3' is an adaptation of the Spanish thriller 'the Hidden Face'
 
 
 'murder-3' main vikram, yani randeep hooda stregling photographer hai south africa main, or unke paas behad pyaar karne vaali ek mahabuuba khushboo, yani aditi raav hydari, he, jo wel-setald hai
 
 
 Mugs and as Vikram meets fashion offers from India to photography, fragrance she brings India and came to leave everything with them
 
 
 yahaan aakar khushboo shaq karne lagati he vikram par or achaanak vah gaayab ho jaati he aisi jagah par, jahaan se vah vikram par nazar rakh sake
 
 
 Vikram's affair begins with Nisha after the disappearance of his girlfriend
 
 
 tippaniyan All the actors in the film have performed well, especially Aditi Rao Hydari
 
 
 imotional seens kaaphi achche hai
 
 
 The directorial debut of Vishesh Bhatt, who is directing the first film, is also good
 
 
 bas, vah ek achche concept ko parde par thik se akzicute nahin kar paae
 
 
 By the way, the investigation of the police looking for the lights seems childish, from inside the room, if someone beats the door with a pole and does not hear the person standing in front of it, something seems strange
 
 
 film kabhi murder mistry lagati he, kabhi horer
 
 
 There is no murder in 'murder-3'
 
 
 bas, pyaar kaa khun he or darshakon ke bharose kaa bhi, isliye 'murder-3' ke liye meri reating he, 2
 5 stars
 
 
 film main sabhi kalakaaron ne acha abhinay kiya he, khaastaur par aditi raav hydari ne
 
 
 Emotional scenes are very good
 
 
 pehali film diarect kar rahe vishesh bhatta kaa nirdesan bhi acha he
 
 
 Simply, he could not execute a good concept on screen properly
 
 
 vaise, roshni ko dhund rahi police kii chaanbin bachakaani lagati he, kamare ke andar se agar koi danda se daravaaza pite or uske saamne khadey insaan ko awaz na sunai de, kuch atapata lagata he
 
 
 The film sometimes looks like murder mystery, sometimes horror
 
 
 'murder-3' main koi murder nahin he
 
 
 That is the blood of love and also the trust of the audience, hence my rating for 'murder-3' is 2
 5 star

 During the Lok Sabha elections, a verbal war between Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and Prime Minister Narendra Modi took place in West Bengal
 mamata ne modi par vyaktigat hamale karne ke saath-saath unhen pradhanmantri maanane tak se inkaar kar diya tha
 Despite the deteriorating relationship during the election, Mamata Banerjee is joining the swearing-in of Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 jabaki 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main mamata ne apane do saansadon ko pratinidhi ke taur par bheja tha, lekin is baar ve khud aa rahi hai
 In such a situation, the question is arising as to what is the reason behind Mamata's swearing in? Mamata Banerjee Mamata Banerjee will arrive in Delhi this evening, accepting the invitation sent to her by Rashtrapati Bhavan and has given her permission to attend the oath-taking ceremony
 mamata ne yah faisla us vakt kiya he, jab bengal main loksabhaa chunaav ke vakt se hi bijepi or tiemasi ke bich kaaphi talkhi bani hui he
 Mamta Banerjee to attend Prime Minister Narendra Modi's swearing in on Thursday, 7 pm

 In 2014, Mamata Banerjee herself did not attend Narendra Modi's swearing-in, but she sent Amit Mitra and Mukul Roy as her representatives
 mukul roy ne pichley saal bijepi kaa daaman tham liya he
 This time BJP has managed to win 18 out of 42 seats in Bengal

 What will reduce political tensions? Actually, Mamata Banerjee is believed to be involved in the swearing in
 Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has taken this decision in view of violence and political tension in Bengal
 iske jariye kahin na kahin donon partiyon ke bich jo raajnneetik tanaav hai use kam karne ke uddeshy chipa hua he
 Assembly elections to be held in 2021 Assembly elections are to be held in Bengal in 2021
 aise main mamata nahin chahengi ki centre or rajya sarkaar ke bich tanaav ke haalat bane
 Through this, Mamata's attempt is to send a message that she wants to keep better coordination with the government
 modi sarkaar ke pichley paanch saal main centre or rajya ke bich behatar sambandh nahin rahe hai
 So, does the Prime Minister now accept Modi? Let me tell you that Mamata Banerjee is criticizing the BJP

 " Union Health Minister Ghulam Nabi Azad gave a unique mantra to tackle the population in Delhi
 mantri ji ne kaha ki agar aabaadi par ankush lagaana he to logon ko bijli do or televijan muhaiyaa karaao
 According to the Minister, the entire blame for the population explosion lies with the Ministry of Power, which has kept people dead from electricity

 So the only means of entertainment for the people is to have children

 '' Are you among those people who like to give gold as a gift to loved ones, even during festivals, weddings or even when there is no special occasion? Or are the person who likes to buy gold bar (gold bar) and coins for investment? If yes, then you can show more understanding while investing in gold
 saal 2015 se sarkaar ne sovrain gold bond yaa sarkari gold bond (esajibi) shuru kiya jo na keval bhautik rup se sone ke mulya ke baraabar he balki kisi bhi anya phixd inakam bond kii tarah is par bhi byaaj miltaa he
 Brijesh Parnami, executive director of Essel Wealth Services, says, "buying government gold bonds is better than buying gold
 esajibi par aapako sone ke mulya vruddhi ke ritern ke alaava 2
 5 percent interest is also available from above
 ''sona chaahe vah aabhushan ke rup main ho yaa phir sone kii pattee yaa sikke ke rup main, use sambhalakar rakhana jokhim bharaa he
 Counting the benefits of SGB, Parnami says, "there is nothing like keeping with SGB
" isamen na to aabhushan banane kaa kharch or na hi aabhushan galane kaa kharch he or na hi kisi shuddhta praaanpatr kii jarurat hoti he
 "better information" Anonymity is talking about gold, which is not physically gold, but you can keep SGB in a demat account just like you keep shares in your demat account
 lowers main jahaan bank aapkaa bhautik sona sambhalakar rakhane ke badale aapse ek nishchit rakam bhi vasuulate hai, uske itar esajibi main sona kahin bhi surakshit rakhaa ja saktaa he
 There is a government guarantee attached to these gold bonds, which means that there is no scope for any kind of manipulation in payment
 esajibi skim main ek vyakti kam se kam ek gram or adhiktam chaar kilo tak sona kharid saktaa he
 SGB can be purchased directly from the bank or through authorized post offices and recognized stock exchanges or agents
 vartmaan main sarkaar online kharidari par 50 rupye pratigram kii chhot de rahi he
 Suresh Sadagopan, founder of Ladder 7 Financial Advisories, says, "government 2 annually
 5 fisadi byaaj de rahi he
 What do you get if you keep gold? ”the interest amount gets deposited in your bank account every half year
 kya koi esajibi se baahar nikal saktaa he?esajibi par milane vaala byaaj ise bahut aakarshak banaata he lekin apatkaaleen sthiti main isse paise nikaale ja sakate hai? haalanki esajibi kii avadhi aath saal kii hoti he lekin koi unhen share yaa bond kii tarah bech bhi saktaa he
 SGB is listed on the main stock markets of India, Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and National Stock Exchange (NSE) and through these you can buy or sell SGB
 sarkaar isse baahar nikalne kii ek suvidha bhi detii he
 You can also return the bond to the government on completion of the fifth, sixth or seventh year
 aathvaan saal puraa hone ke baad bond ko bhunaaya ja saktaa he or niveshak ko sone ke us samay ke bazaar bhav par bhugtan kiya jaataa he
 Quick loan can also be availed on SGB in case of emergency
 paranami kehete hai, ''sone par rin badi aasaani se mil jaataa he
 Banks also lend by physically keeping gold
 sone se jis prakaar udhaar mil jaataa he waisi hi suvidha gold bond par bhi di gai he
 "the most true is gold
 People usually buy gold either for making jewelry or for investment
" agar achaanak koi jarurat pad jaae to us samay paas main rakhaa sona bada kaam aata he
 If the motive is to invest for the future or to accumulate gold for children's marriage after a few years, then SGB is a better option
 sadagopan kehete hai, ''kuch log sona kharidte hai ki aage chalakar bete yaa beti kii shaadi main yaa phir uphaar dene ke kaam aayega
 SGB is the best option for such investors
 '' sadagopan kii baat ko aage badhaate hue paranami bataate hai, ''jo log nivesh ke liye sona kharidkar rakhte hai or bachat kaa nivesh sone main karte hai, unke liye esajibi mufeed vikalp he
 "buying gold becomes the biggest expense in marriage, so little by little, SGB is a convenient and safe way for your needs
" isse aapako nivesh ke varshon main sone kii keemat kaa ausat mulya to praapt hota hi he, saath hi saath kuch byaaj bhi mil jaataa he
 It ensures you a certain amount of gold and interest on it after a period of eight years
 paranami kehete hai, ''sarkaar jab bhi esajibi jari karti he, koi bhi vyakti usamen nivesh kar saktaa he
 "sonakya as an investment
 Should someone finish all their fixed deposits, sell all the shares and buy SGB?" Knowledgeable people refuse to do so
 bakphast financial adwijuri services ke ko-pramotor vijay mantri kehete hai, ''kisi ko sona yaa sone se jude kisi vittiya utpaada main nivesh kaa paraamarsh dene ke saath ek badi pareshaani yah he ki log usamen andhadhundh nivesh karte hai or antat jarurat se zyada dhaatu kharid lete hai
 "experts believe that any person should make only five to 15 percent of the investment in gold
 isamen sone kii pattee (baar), sikke, gold mutual fund or esajibi sab shaamil kiye ja sakate hai
 "since gold has a negative relationship with other financial assets, if the gold is invested in the portfolio to the right level, it eases the volatility shock in other assets such as equities or bonds," says Sadagopan
 Can absorb from
 apane nivesh kaa paanch se das pratishat sone ke rup main rakhane main koi harj nahin he
 "the impact on tax is the interest is received on the investment in SGB, in addition to this, if the bond is kept for its entire duration, then the government also gives tax exemption
 paranami bataate hai, ''agar aap bhautik rup se sona yaa esajibi ko teen saal se adhik samay tak rakhte hai to ise long turm holding mana jaataa he or yah indexeshan ke saath 20 fisadi long turm capital gen (altisiji) kaa paatr ho jaataa he
 Yes, if sold three years ago, it will be counted in short-term capital gains (STCG) and will be charged STGC as per the individual's tax range
 baharhaal yadi aap esajibi ko isaki puri avadhi tak rakhte hai to is par hone vaali prapti puri tarah se tex mukt hogi
 The interest you get on SGB will be taxed only
 paranami kehete hai, ''thodi maatra main kharid kii suvidha ke kaaran nivesh ke laabh ko badhaayaa ja saktaa he kyonki koi bhi niveshak aage chalakar sara sona ek khate main laakar nivesh portpholio bada kar saktaa he saath hi saath rupye ke mulya ke ausat kaa laabh le saktaa he
 If you are investing for a long time 2
 5 pratishat salanaa byaaj, nivesh ke kul ritern par ek bada fark daal saktaa he

 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he) The Delhi government has decided to start a registry in illegal colonies on Tuesday
 MCD or AAP sarkaar main ek baar phir takaraav ke asaar bad gaye hai, kyonki MCD le out plan paas karne kii baat to kar rahi he, lekin le out plan ke liye paise milane kii shart par
 The ACD government is set to come face-to-face once again after the statement of Delhi Deputy CM Manish Sisodia in preparation to lift the ban on the registry, as the government has decided to start the registry in unauthorized colonies
 lekin nigam kii maane, to yah kaam itnaa aasaan nahin hone ja rahaa he, kyonki bina le-out plan kii registry karne se vyavastha puri tarah charmara jaaegi
 If the layout plan is to be prepared by the corporation, then first the Delhi government or the concerned RWA will have to pay the corporation for the layout plan
 rakam milte hi emsidi le-out plan paas karne main deree nahin karegi
 According to the MCD, the opening of the registry in the colonies is not done with the announcement of the Delhi government that the boundaries of the colonies are being fixed and the registry will start as soon as the boundary is fixed, because the layout plan will be fixed only after the boundary is fixed
 It is made
 isamen bataaya jaataa he ki kahaan makaan hai or kahaan skool, park yaa duusari suvidhaon ke liye jameen chodi gai he
 If this is not done, that is, the work of the registry has been started only after fixing the boundary, then who owns the plot or on which plot school or other facilities are to be given, it cannot be disposed of
 isse malikana adhikaar ke alag-alag daawey saamne aa jaaenge
 It is clear that the Delhi government has tried to show that with this decision, it has opened the way to the registry of colonies
 agar deree hoti he, to uske liye emsidi ko dosha diya ja saktaa he
 In this way, the Delhi government can shed its hand on the delay in making the layout plan and the entire blunder will be blamed on the MCD
 aise main is maamle main AAP raajnneetik badhat lene kii koshish jarur karegi

 In this eager wait for election results, Varun Dhawan and Alia Bhatt's film 'badrinath Ki Dulhaniya' has been released today
 yah film kahani he badrinaath or vaidehi ke pyaar kii
 Varun Dhawan i
e
 Badrinath makes every possible effort to make his love Alia Bhatt i
e
 Vaidehi his bride, but Vaidehi runs away from the wedding pavilion
 vaidehi kyon or kahan bhaagti he iske liye aapako film dekhni padegi
 Talking about other aspects of this film, the bride of the film Badrinath is a light-hearted love story with a glimpse of Jhansi in Uttar Pradesh or a small town in India where people compromise very little on customs and traditions
 tippaniyan Made in the production house of Karan Johar, this film has a great temper of comedy
 ya saath hi isamen thode imoshan or drama bhi he
 The first part of the film is very good and the pace of this part is also fast
 film main kaaphi sari ghatnaayen hoti hai or badrinaath apni dulhaniyaan ko hasil karne kii jaddojahad kar rahaa he
 Alia Bhatt and Varun Dhawan's chemistry in this film is also very good
 lekin film kii kamajori he iskaa second half jo thodaa kamjor padaa he
 It felt as if the story is not moving forward, it is being forcefully enhanced
 kai drishy atapate lagate hai jaise badrinaath kaa singapore main ladaai jhagada karnaa
 The special thing about 'badrinath Ki Dulhania' is that even on many serious things jokes are tightened
 jaise ki kaise aaj ke daur main bhi kis tarah bete ke janm par acchhee quality ke laddu baante jate hai or beti ke janm par sanste pede
 How the practice like dowry is still prevalent and a huge amount of dowry is given to the educated girl for marrying
 yah film bataati hai ki kaise ladke apane parivaar ke liye ek sampatti yaa jaruri cheez or ladkiyaan parivaar ke liye ek jimmedaari hoti hai
 This film gets 3 stars from our side
 karan johar ke production house main bani is film main kamedi kaa behtareen tadakaa he
 It also has some emotion and drama in it
 film kaa pehla bhaag bahut acha he or is hisse kii raftaar bhi tej he
 There are a lot of incidents in the film and Badrinath is struggling to get his bride
 is film main bhi aalia bhatta or varun dhawan kii chemistry kaaphi acchhee he
 But the weakness of the film is its second half which is slightly weak
 aisa laga jaise kahani aage bad nahin rahi he use jabardastee badhaayaa ja rahaa he
 Many scenes seem strange as Badrinath fights in Singapore
 'badrinaath kii dulhaniyaan' kii khaas baat ye he ki majaak-majaak main kaaphi syrius baton par bhi tanj kas jaati he
 Like how in today's era, how are laddoos of good quality distributed on the birth of a son, and bend over the birth of a daughter
 kis tarah dahej jaisi pratha aaj bhi kaayam he or padhi likhi ladki ko byaahne ke liye bhi dahej kii baari rakam di jaati he
 This film tells how boys are an asset or important thing for their family and girls are a responsibility for the family
 is film ko hamaari taraf se milte hai 3 star

 The court has expressed displeasure over the police's attitude that it does not expose the real criminals responsible for prostitution and human trafficking in the GB Road Red Light area
 tees hajaari court main edishnal seshan jaj kaveri baweja ne jibi road red lite ilaake main chal rahe kothon ke asli maalikon ko na talash paane ke liye dilli police ko kadi fatkaar lagaai he
 The court said that it seems that the police is giving incitement to those running the cell for trade
 court ne apane faisle main kaha he ki police maanav taskari or deh vyapaar karne vaale asli aparaadhiyon ko giraftaar karne ke liye koi khaas koshish nahin karti
 For this reason, those who commit such crimes are not able to expose the real faces, who are fully aware of this fraud
 court ne maanav taskari or deh vyapaar kaa kaala kaarobaar karne waalon ke khilaaf karrwai karne kaa police kamishnar ko nirdesh diya he
 The court said these things in its judgment while acquitting a woman named Pushpa accused of forcibly trading girls
 court ne apane faisle main kaha ki is maamle va duusare kai maamalon main kamala market police kii carguzari ko dekhte hue yah jaruri ho jaataa he ki faisle kii ek copy police kamishnar ko bhi bheji jaye
 The police commissioner will decide that the chargesheets that are filed in such cases should be strengthened so that the real people who commit crimes like human trafficking and prostitution can be punished and such crimes can be curbed
 na sirf nichali adaalat, balki dilli hoicourt bhi is tarah ke aparaadhon kii roak-tham ke liye police ko kai baar pehle bhi nirdesh de chuki he
 But the latest verdict shows how serious the police is to rein in such crimes and criminals
 dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal par pehali baar rishwatakhori kaa aarope laga he
 Yogendra Yadav, who was expelled from the Aam Aadmi Party with great disdain, also cannot believe this charge
 kapil mishra ke saath khadey kumaar vishwaas bhi kanni kaat gaye
 But there is a character in this stigma that is being repeatedly mentioned, that character is Satyendra Jain
 jin ke sir par kejariwal itani majbootee se haath rakhe hue hai ki sabko hairaani ho rahi he
 The question is whether Kejriwal has to bear the brunt of Satyendra Jain's action, because the truth is that neither Yogendra Yadav is convinced on the charge of bribery on Kejriwal nor Kumar Vishwas while bjp's attack on Satyendra Jain from Dharkejriwal Is also much faster
 kapil mishra ke aaropon par bijepi do daleelon se kejariwal par hamale kar rahi he
 The first argument is that Kapil Mishra was a member of the cabinet, so what he is saying should be seen as eye-proof
 duusari daleel ye ki kejariwal, satyendra jain par lagane vaale aaropon main suraksha kavach banakar khadey rahe, jiskaa matlab ye ki daal main kahin naa kahin kuch kaala jarur he
 Is Kejriwal going to pay the price of Satyendra Jain's patronage? Is Satyendra Jain Kejriwal's weak link on which the BJP is continuously hammering out the brand Kejriwal
 satyendra jain par ye pehla aarope nahin hai
 a long list of allegations is recorded in his name
 -satyendra jain par sabase gambhir aarope hawala kaarobaariyon se sampark rakhane kaa he
 Satyendar Jain is accused of creating crores from hawala by using companies and using them he bought 200 acres of land
 -iskar vibhaag ne in maamalon main jain ke khilaaf notice jari kiya, shuruaati jaanch bhi kii or kuch sampattiyaan kurk bhi kii gayi
 - Satyendra Jain also came under questions regarding the appointment of a daughter to the post of consultant in the Ministry of Health
 -jain kii beti saumya kii niyukti par shungalu cameti ne bhi sawaal uthaae
 - An FIR was lodged against Satyendar Jain for making Kejriwal's relative Nikunj Agarwal an OSD as there were allegations of rigging in Nikunj's appointment
 kejariwal ke cabinet se andar-baahar ke silisile ke bich satyendra jain kii kursi salaamat rahi
 Satyendra Jain's hair was not deterred despite all the allegations
 satyendra jain kejariwal ke vishwaasapaatr bane rahe or unki vajah se bijepi aam aadmi party par hamalvar hoti rahi
 This is not surprising

 So Amit wrapped his father's body in a white sheet and then put it in a car and went towards Uttarakhand

 ) We all know that premature children's immunity is less developed than normal children
 par haal main hue ek shodh main kaha gaya he ki aise bachche padhai main kamjor hote hai or unki maths bhi acchhee nahin hoti
 Researchers say that in premature children these symptoms remain effective even in the future and they are not able to perform calculations like normal children
 aamtaur par garbhakaal 36 saptaah kaa hota he lekin aise bachche jo 34wein hafte main yaa phir usase bhi pehle paidaa hote hai ve 42 saal kii umr main, duusare bacchon kitulana main kam kamaate hai
 Such children are not able to do any special or very good job and they will be able to build their own house, there is very little hope of this
 kai baar aisa hota he ki maa-baap primaor bacchon ko der se skool bhejte hai
 They think that when the child gets a little older, then he will be sent to school but this is not a solution
 shodhakartaaon kaa kahana he ki aise bacchon ko bhi saamaanya bacchon kii tarah sahi umr main hi skool bhejnaa chahie lekin un par vishesh dhyaan dene kii jarurat hoti he
 The average birth of premature babies in the world is 11%
 shodhakarta maanate hai ki pichley teen dashakon main primaor berth-rate kaaphi badha he
 But at the same time the percentage of serving these children has also increased
 yahaan tak kii ab to 17 hafte main janme bachche bhi jivit rahete hai
 According to Professor Dieter Volk of Britain's University of Warwick, premature children's brains are not fully developed
 aise bacchon kaaikue saamaanya bacchon kii tulana main kamahota he, saath hi aise bachche maths main bhi kamjor hote hai
 Due to these shortcomings, such children also have trouble in getting employment
 aise main unhen aarthik samasyaon se bhi jujhna pad saktaa he

 garmi ke mausam main garm hawa or bade hue taapmaana se lu lagane kaa khatra bad jaataa he
 One should be cautious if the temperature of the body suddenly increases or if there is a sudden onset of severe pain in the head
 ye donon lu lagane ke lakshan hai
 Heat stroke has a bad effect on the kidneys, brain and heart, affecting the performance of these organs
 lu lagane ke baad naadee or saans kii gati tej ho jaati he
 Many times it has been observed that red rash also occur on the skin
 kai logon ko lu lagane par baar-baar peshaab kii bhi shikaayat ho jaati he or sharir main jakadan ho jaati he
 Home remedies are very effective in avoiding heatstroke in scorching heat

 Cold water should not be drunk immediately after coming from strong sunlight and sweating
 garmi ke dinon main baar-baar pani pite rahanaa chahie taaki sharir main pani kii kami na ho
 Mixing lemon and salt in water and drinking it two or three times a day reduces the risk of heat stroke

 madhya pradesh main vyapam ghotaalaa ek baar phir charchaa main he
 The Congress has strongly attacked the Shivraj government with some alleged documents
 congress ke tamaam netaaon ne is ghotaale main shivaraj singh chouhan or unke parivaar par shaamil hone kaa aarope lagaaya he or unka istipha maanga he
 Digvijay Singh said that a few days ago it was said that the Governor's son is involved in the appointment till serial number 106-115
 vahiin, digvijay singh ne daawa kiya ki kuch serial numberon ke saamne siem likhaa hua tha
 Senior advocate KTS Tulsi said that Vyapam's papers have changed the name of cm's office to Governor's House
 saath hi siem ke naam kii jagah uma bharti kaa naam likh diya gaya
 At the same time, Congress leader Kamal Nath alleged that the Chief Minister and his family are being saved in this scam
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki vibhaag ke ek computer kii hard discs ko bhi badal diya gaya he
 He said that this is injustice to the people and its CM and his ministers are responsible
 unhone mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ke istife kii maang karte hue kaha ki estf siem ke ishaare par kaam kar rahi he
 Jyotiraditya Scindia, who was present at the press conference, said that the people of the state have been cheated and the state government has tampered with the papers
 unhone kaha ki doshi log aaazaad gum rahe hai or nirdosh chaatr salaakhon ke peeche hai
 At the same time, Congress leader Suresh Pachauri has demanded a CBI inquiry into the case
 isse pehle, madhya pradesh main vyavsaayik pariksha mandal (vyapam) dwaara yojit parikshaon main hue ghotaale kii jaanch ke liye banaai gai special investigeshan team (esaiti) ko congress ke mahasachiv digvijay singh ne somvaar ko ahm dastavej saunpe hai
 What is in these documents, Singh has not disclosed
 rajya main vyapam dwaara yojit piemti, parivahan aarakshak, shikshak bhartee parikshaon main vyapak paimaane par farjivada hua he
 The Special Task Force (STF) subordinate to the SIT is investigating on the directions of the Jabalpur High Court

 It also includes a technical officer, former minister and politicians of various parties

 Singh met SIT chief Chandresh Bhushan on Monday in the presence of others along with senior advocate Vivek Tankha and also handed over documents
 esaiti pramukh ne media se charchaa ke dauraan mana he ki digvijay ne jo dastavej saunpe hai unamem ek nayaa dastavej he, jarurat padane par ve iskaa estf se pareekshan karaayenge
 'the Qajis and Maulanas have misled the Muslim community for a long time by misinterpreting the Quran
 islam yaa quran main kabhi bhi mahilaon ko doum darja nahin diya gaya he
 But by promoting misinterpretation, these people promoted it instead of preventing injustice to women
 ’ muslim personal lau board kii adhyaksh shysta ambar kahati hai agar ol india muslim personal lau board ne apni jimmedaari nibhaai hoti to auraton ko court kaa darwaja nahin khatkhataana padataa
 Actually, the Muslim Women Protection of Rights on Marriage Bill, 2017 is to be introduced in the Lok Sabha on Thursday, 28 December
 aise main hangaamaa to katnaa hi he
 The All India Muslim Personal Law Board has been opposing this bill from the very beginning
 ol india muslim personal lau board ke sadsy sajaad nomani ke anusaar tripal talaak ke khilaaf bill laane se pehle sabhi sambandhit pakshon se baatcheet nahin kii gai he
 Another board member Maulana Khalid Saifullah Rahmani has said that he would request a review of the bill by writing a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 islam main mili hakon se auraton ko moulanaon ne rakhaa maharumshista ambar kahati hai, ‘quran main talaak-e-biddat jaisaa koi kanoon nahin he
 That is, there is no mention of the process of getting a divorce by saying three divorces at once
 talaak lene kii baqayada ek prakriya he
 This process takes three months
 is avadhi ko tuhr kehete hai
 During this, it is confirmed that the woman is not pregnant at all
 yah avadhi isliye bhi rakhi gai ki kahin gusse yaa aaveg main aakar koi faisla na ho jaae
 This is followed by divorce and intervention by Muslim religious leaders
 ’ambar kahati hai ki yah majahab kaa hissaa nahin balki saamaajik buraai he
 It is the responsibility of the community responsible organizations to eliminate it
 ol india muslim personal lau board yah bataae ki usne kitni baar is tarah ke talaak ko nazaij tehraaya? yah bhi bataae ki muslim samudaay kii auraton ko jaagruk karne ke liye kitni baar masjidon main sabhaayen kii gayi? ishtihaar nikaale gaye
 Nikah is a contract in the Muslim community, it is not part of the religion
 lekin lagaataar ise majahab se jodakar moulanaon ne muslim mardon kii manamaani chalane di
 The Maintenance Act came in 1986 after the Shah Bano case, in which the Waqf Board had asked for food expenses to divorced women
 lekin auraton ko iske bare main pataa hi nahin he
 The task of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board was to promote this right through advertisement, through announcements in mosques
 to kya aisa kiya gaya?islam main yah bhi kaha gaya kitlaak ke liemily power kaa durupyog karne par kodon kii sajaa he
 But it has to be proved that if misuse is done then how many men who divorced women were punished with whips by using the power of divorce? Most women do not know this
 phone par, whatrup par, chitthee ke jariye, pani par likhakar talaak dena haraam he
 Why did the Kajis not break the silence on this
 abhi to or lambii chalegi ladayeewumen personal lau board kii adhyaksh shysta ambar kahati hai, tripal talaak par kanoon banane ke baad bhi yah ladaai jari rahegi
 The petition filed in the Supreme Court on behalf of the Women's Personal Law Board sought a stay on triple talaq, halala and polygamy
 haalanki supreme court ne tripal talaak ke alaava baaki donon maamalon ko philhal abhi nahin chuaa he
 But the Women's Personal Law Board has started preparations for filing a petition against Hallala and polygamy
 kya he halaala?sharia kanuunamen halaala ek tarah se teen talaak dene ke baad shuhar ke liye haraam ho chuki usee bivi ko dobaaraa hasil karne kaa tarika he
 That is, after giving three divorces, if again the husband wants to keep his wife back with him, first the woman is married to another man
 ek raat uske saath gujarane ke baad aurat kaa doosraa shuhar use talaak de detaa he
 And then she marries her first husband
 yah puri prakriya halaala he
 The polygamous law allows a Muslim man to have four marriages
 lekin is ijaajat ke peeche jo shart he vah behad kathin he
 Shaista Amber says, according to the Quran, a second marriage can be done only when the husband is able to give equal rights to his first wife
 uski rajamandi hasil kar sake
 Force is forbidden
 agar donon auraton ko taraazoo kii nonk kii tarah insaaf na de sako to doosraa vivaah karne par roak he
 Ambar asks if it is possible to do so in today's time
 bilkul quran main itani kadi sharten lagane ke peeche bhi yah makasad tha ki bahuvivaah karne se pehle das baar sochaa jaae
 But does it happen? Therefore these strict conditions in itself will form the basis of our petition
 kya he, prastaavit tripal talaak kanoon?cabinet main 15 disambar ko muslim women (protection of ritis on marij) bill paas kiya hua tha
 According to the proposed law, it would be illegal to grant three divorces at once

 Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who has overcome Team India many times in odd circumstances, could not do any miracle during the third and deciding ODI against England
 dhoni 66 gendon kii pari main 42 ran hi bana paae, jisase team india england ko bada lakshya nahin de pai
 In the end, Shardul Thakur scored 22 not out off 13 balls with the help of two sixes, bringing the team score to 250

 "tax officials must have smiled upon hearing Prime Minister Narendra Modi from the ramparts of the Red Fort, because the truth is what they are told in the closed rooms of the Revenue Department and the Enforcement Directorate

 She would have been able to strike the right balance between leniency and strictness in tax rules, before the infamous tax bureaucracy gained immense power to persecute taxpayers, by making the laws of tax and financial functioning merciless
 alabatta nayaa iskar kanoon to kab se nahin aayaa or jiesti to tex pranali sahaj karne ke vaade ke saath laayaa gaya tha
 Then what happened that the tax bureaucracy has become a new name of terror for businessmen
 tex teror kaa yah daur anti mani londring kanoon (2005 se lagu 2009 or 2013 main sanshodhan) kii dein he jisane kaarobaar ko lekar na keval naukarshahi kaa najariya badal diya balki unhen bhayanak takat bhi de di
 Controversy since birth, the Enforcement Directorate has become the most powerful vigilance agency in the country with the strictest provisions so far (attachment of property, impossible bail)
 mani londring ke khilaaf global muhim main bharat ajeebogareeb andaaj main shaamil hua
 In the era of the first NDA government (vajpayee), liberalization in the Indian economy, the government had freed foreign exchange from the grip of the terrible FERA law
 isaki jagah femaa laayaa gaya jo videshi mudra niyam ulanghan ko civil aparaadh kii shrenee main rakhata tha
 But by then the FATF (1989) and the United Nations-led Global Consent on Money Laundering Laws (1998), to finance terror and curb the drug business, had led to the terrorist attack on America (9 / 11) Caught fast afterwards
 natijatan, videshi mudra ke istemaal ko udaar karne vaala femaa or kaarobaar par sakhti kaa anti mani londring kanoon ek saath sansad main (2002-yashavanth sinha) main pesh hue
 The teeth of this law started appearing after 2009
 2012 main pichhali taarikh se tex (vodaphone) lagane kaa vivaad ubhara or tatkaaleen vitt mantri pranav mukherjee yah kehete sune gaye ki bharat koi tex heaven nahin he
 By this time, the revenue bureaucracy had begun to see every business in the country through the prism of potential money laundering
 anti mani londring kanoon itnaa khaufnak isliye he kyonki• yah akelaa kanoon he jisamen idi ke adhikari sirf apane akalan (rigen tu bilive) ke aadhaar par sampatti jabt kar sakate hai
 Court approval is not necessary
 agar mani londring kii gai sampatti videsh main he to baraabar kii sampatti bharat main jabt hogi
 • Nearly two dozen major laws and more than 75 offenses are under its purview
 inamen trademark, paryaavaran nasht karne ke aparaadh bhi hai
 Apart from this, money laundering can also be done in innumerable possible offenses
 inakam tex or jiesti iske tahat nahin he lekin tex frod se jude maamalon par adhikari mani londring kaa aarope lagaakar sampatti jabt kar sakate hai
 • Till the order of the Supreme Court in 2017, bail in this law was also difficult
 ab bhi aasaan nahin he
 Notorious for sluggish prosecution, the ED has opened more than 2,000 files but half a dozen cases have not been prosecuted
 2005 se ab tak anti mani londring main koi bari bhi nahin hua he
 Advocates know that this law can be applied in any crime and everything of the businessman can end
 iskar ke tahat kuch taaja badlaav (abhiyog chalaane ke kathor praavdhaan yaa videsh main kaala dhan chhipaane kaa taaja kanoon) bhi isi se prerit hai
 India's financial vigilance agencies have two faces
 ek ke jariye ve siyasat ke ishaare par bade maamalon (jaise chidambaram) main surkhiyaan batorti hai or antat: adaalat (2ji, koyala, kaamanwealth) main dher ho jaati hai jabaki doosraa cheharaa apni takat se kaarobaariyon kaa daraata he
 It is worth mentioning that very strict laws in the lawless system become oppressors and increase corruption
 bharat main kaale dhan kii dhulaai yani mani londring kitni kam hui? kuch hua hota to notebandi kaa kahar na tutaa hota! bhaajapa, upie kii sarkaar ke dauraan tex aatank ko kos kar satta main ai thi
 But today the Prime Minister is losing the terror of tax from the Red Fort

 loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ko maat dene ke liye congress mahagathbandhan kii pich taiyaar karne main juty hui thi
 But now it seems that the Congress has given a new dimension to its strategy and has decided to contest elections alone in more than one state
 andhra pradesh or pashchim bengal unamem se ek hai
 The Congress also announced it in Andhra Pradesh on Wednesday
 vahiin, loksabhaa chunaav 2019 (loksabha Election 2019) se pehle partiyon ke bich gathbandhan kaa daur jari he
 In the capital on Thursday, a meeting was held between Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal and former Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit
 is dauraan donon ek duusare se garm joshi ke saath mili
 Sheila Dixit caught Arvind Kejriwal's hand during this time and also talked to him
 udhar, loksabhaa chunaav se pehle aarakshan kaa mudda ek baar phir se charchaa kaa vishay banataa ja rahaa he
 While the Modi government at the Center has given 10 percent reservation to the upper castes, on the other hand, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has advocated a re-consideration of SC ST class reservation
 unhone kaha ki in virgon ko die jane vaale aarakshan ko phir se badaye jane kii jarurat he

 loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ko maat dene ke liye congress mahagathbandhan kii pich taiyaar karne main juty hui thi
 But now it seems that the Congress has given a new dimension to its strategy and has decided to contest elections alone in more than one state
 andhra pradesh or pashchim bengal unamem se ek hai
 The Congress also announced it in Andhra Pradesh on Wednesday

 Oommen Chandy said that they will again gather on 31 January to discuss the preparations for the election
 unhone kaha ki rajya congress ne farvari main sabhi 13 jilon main ek bas yatra nikaalane kaa nirnay kiya he
 This means that there will be no grand alliance between Congress and TDP in Andhra Pradesh
 donon partiyon haal hi telugana main hue vidhansabha chunaav main saath ladi thim, lekin chunaav kaa nateeja donon partiyon ke liye kaaphi bhayanak sabit hua
 Perhaps this is the reason why both parties want to contest elections alone in Andhra Pradesh

 uske baad se hi congress or aap ke bich loksabhaa chunaav se pehle gathbandhan ke kayaas lagaae jane lage the
 Before the Lok Sabha elections, the issue of reservation is once again becoming a topic of discussion

 He said that the reservation given to these classes needs to be increased again
 bihar ke purv mukhyamantri karpuri thakur kii janyati ke kaarykram main shaamil hue nitish kumaar ne apni baat rakhi
 Nitish said that the population of scheduled castes, tribes and backward societies has increased but there is a 50 percent reservation limit
 is sambandh main sarkaron ke paas jo aankade maujuud hai wo 1931 kii janaganana par aadhaarit hai
 In these circumstances, caste-based census is a better way, it needs to be implemented as soon as possible so that there is no scope for any doubt on it

 Board General Secretary Maulana Wali Rahmani said on Sunday that Muslims had faith in the judiciary, that is why a reconsideration petition is being filed on the Ayodhya case, but that trust has weakened after the Babri Masjid decision

 He said that there is a job crisis in India, there is a crisis of agriculture in India and Modi ji has proved that he is not able to overcome it
 notebandi, jiesti ne naukariyon ko khatm kar diya
 When asked about jobs, Modi ji says to make 'pakodas'

 The farmers are demanding to forgive their debts but Narendra Modi does not hear anything
 unhone 15 logon kaa saadhe teen lakh karod maaf kiya
 We waived the loan of the farmers in two days
 congress sachai kii raksha karti he, ve jhooth kii raksha karte hai
 There is no shortage of money in the country
 kisaanon se kaha jaataa he karja waapas do, anil ambani se kyon nahin kehete? Rahul Gandhi said that the press says, if the debt is forgiven, the habit will get worse
 kya maalya, ambani, mehul kii aadat nahin bigadi? aap unki aadat bigaadenge to ham kisaanon kii aadat bigaadenge
 If the debt of the rich is forgiven, then the debt of the farmers will also be forgiven

 This will be the first time in such a large country and Congress will successfully complete it
 unhone kaha ki congress udyogpatiyon ke khilaaf nahin he
 We are against crony capitalism
 
 Such as Mallya, Mehul, Nirav Modi
 unhone kaha ki ham ek sanghathan kii aawaaj nahin hai, ham sava sau karod logon kii aawaaj hai
 This is the difference between us and them
 ye saavarkar kaa sanghathan nahin he jo angrejon ke saamne gidgidaae
 This is Gandhi's organization
 ham peeche hatane vaale nahin he, ham front foot par khelenge or modi ko desh kii aawaaj sunaayenge
