 Samajwadi Party's patron, Mulamayam Singh Yadav, arrived at the new government house in Lucknow, Shivpalayadav, who rebelled against the Samajwadi Party and formed the Progressive Samajwadi Party (lohia)
 mulaayam kaa swaagat karte hue shivpal ne kaha ki 'netaji yah pragatisheel samaajawaadee party he or ab aapako isi main rahanaa he
 Mulayam Singh said while agreeing on this - OK
 shivpal ne yah bhi kaha ki wo netaji ko party kii rashtriya adhyaksh bananaa chaahate hai
 But after finishing his speech from here, he went to the Samajwadi Party office to meet with Akhilesh
 ab donon party ke kaaryakartaaon kii nigahen un par lagi hui hai ki wo ab kya bolte hai
 Shivpal said to Mulayam Singh that you have to become the national president of this party
 ham aapako rashtriya adhyaksh banane kaa prastaav karte hai
 This proposal was supported by the people of Shivpal's party in unison
 shivpal ne kaha, 'jahaan samaajawaadee log hai vahiin netaa ji hai
 On this Mulayam asked to call a national conference
 iske baad shivpal ne 5 din main rashtriya sammelan bulaane kii baat kahi
 When Mulayam Singh Yadav reached Shivpal's house, he started praising SP
 aise main kaaryakartaaon kii aawaaj ai ki yah samaajawaadee party nahin pragatisheel samaajawaadee party he
 On this Mulayam Singh said, 'ok, now the Samajwadi Party has become another name Progressive Samajwadi Party
 'bataa den ki mulaayam kaa shivpal ke ghar pahunchnaa sapa adhyaksh akhilesh yadav ke liye jhatka mana ja rahaa he
 Mulayam once again made the sp's people restless by saying his blessings to Shivpal's Progressive Samajwadi Party (lohia) and strengthening the party
 lekin iske baad akhilesh ke saath chal rahi meeting se sapa kaaryakartaaon ne raat kii saans lee
 Shivpal has already said that he has formed a socialist secular front only with the blessings of Mulayam Singh Yadav
 netaa ji kaa aashirwad unke saath he or aage bhi rahegaa
 Mulayam, who reached Shivpal's bungalow on Tuesday, said many things that could increase Akhilesh's tension
 mulaayam singh yadav ke bare main kaha jaataa he ki unka baayan haath kya karegaa, yah unka daayan haath bhi nahin jaanata
 He sometimes praises Akhilesh and sometimes gives advice to Akhilesh through public forums
 isi tarah kabhi shivpal par ekadam chup ho jate hai, kabhi kehete hai samaajawaadee party main sabhi log ek hai
 Political reviewers say that it was because of Mulayam that Shivpal could not form a separate party when Akhilesh was the chief minister
 yah mulaayam kii raajnneeti hi rahi ki donon unhen apana netaa maanate rahe
 Please tell that Mayawati used to live in this bungalow before Shivpal

 When, who, where and how can be the victim of Bahnji's havoc cannot be said

 The leader in the party, who has a keen eye on Maya, has to go out

 desh ke kai rajyon main bispi kaa janaadhar badhane laga
 In this episode, Mayawati came in contact with Kanshi Ram and the BSP got a new force in Uttar Pradesh
 1993 main bispi ne espi ke saath milakar upi main sarkaar banaai or phir to bispi ne peeche mudakar nahin dekha
 Mayawati also climbed one successive ladder

 But she was thrown out of the party as soon as Mayawati was eyed
 verma kaaphi samay tak upi vidhansabha main adhyaksh rahe hai
 Apart from Barkhuram, among the Kurmi leaders, Ram Lakhan Verma, Jangbahadur Patel, RK Patel and Sone Lal Patel were also considered to be right hands of Kanshi Ram, but they could not escape the wrath of Mayawati and she was forced to leave the party
 jabaki soobe main 5 fisadi kurmi matadaata hai

 Mayawati has also shown him the way out of the party

 Before the 2017 assembly elections, former minister of Sitapur district, Abdul Mannan, his brother Abdul Hannan, Rajya Sabha member Narendra Kashyap or MLA Rampal Yadav, were all expelled from the party as soon as Mayawati was out of the list of favorites
 isi tarah kanshiram ke saathi rahe raaj bahadur, ram samujh, hira thakur or jugal kishor jaise netaa bhi mayawati ke prakope se nahin batch paae
 Captain Alexander Rizvi, who accompanied Mayawati during the guest house attack, was also shown the exit

 Waugh also said that if a team wants to be the best, it should be able to deal with all situations
 wa ne kaha, ‘aaj subah dhoni kii pratikriya khel ke liye nakaaratmak thi jab usne kaha ki bhartiya curataron ko pichon ko team ke anukool bananaa chahie
 i did not understand it
 ’bhartiya captain ne somvaar ko ahmedabad main england ke khilaaf pehle test main jeet darj karne ke baad motera ke wicket par naaraazgi jataai thi or kaha ki ham chaahate hai ki curator aisi pich taiyaar karen jis par gend pehle din se turn kare
 According to Waugh, 'if you want to be aggressive and the best in the world, then you have to play in all kinds of situations and do not always advocate the kind of situation that suits your style
 isse main thodaa hairaan hum
 i think if you want to be the best in the world then you have to learn to play in all circumstances
 ’wa ne kaha ki australian team kii captaini ke dauraan vah kabhi is baat ko adhik tavajjo nahin dete the ki unhen kis tarah ke wicket par khelnaa he
 He said, 'I captained the team in 57 matches and never talked to the curator about what kind of pitch we have to play
 ’australia kii ore se 168 test khilne vaale wa ne haalanki kaha ki england ke khilaaf chaar test kii siries main bharat jeet kaa prabal daavedaar he
 He said, 'india's team is strong, it is always difficult to beat India in India
 kuch yuva khilaadi bhi saamne aa rahe hai jo bhartiya cricket ke liye achche sanket hai
 (cheteshwar) Pujara scored a double century, Virat Kohli is playing well, Pragyan Ojha took wickets, it is good for Indian cricket

 ' america raashtrapati baraak obama ke daure se bharat ne isse zyada paane kii aas nahin lagaai thi
 As such, the US has agreed on its behalf in the name of India for permanent membership of the UN Security Council

 India will also need China's support
 aatankwaad ke masale par bharat kii janata obama ke munh se pakistan ke bare main usase kahin zyada sunne ko betaab thi, jitna obama daure ke shuruyaat kehane ko taiyaar the
 Later, the US President gave a relatively strong statement against Pakistan proving to be a terror for terrorists
 jo log pehle yah sochakar bhaybheet ho rahe the ki kahin obama kashmir par koi kathor bayaan na de baithen, ve ab chakit hai
 This is an issue on which India's diplomatic situation is currently weak
 obama america kii tayshuda niti se bilkul bhi alag nahin hate
 The US has so far believed that the Kashmir dispute is a bilateral issue between India and Pakistan
 saath hi obama ne donon deshon ke bich baatcheet shuru karne ke paksh main raay di he
 On this issue, he has also provided an excellent opportunity to Manmohan Singh
 manmohan ke us rukh ko bal mila he, jisamen unhone kaha he ki pakistan kii jameen se aatankwaad ko samarthan or usase vaarta-donon saath-saath nahin chal sakati
 The US withdrew the restrictions imposed on some Indian companies

 Obama himself added to the ongoing rhetoric about outsourcing
 america kii shikaayat yah rahi he ki uske desh se naukariyaan bharat ja rahi he
 Obama himself was forced to present such an image of India that this country is like an 'alternative workplace' for the whole world
 bhaashan ke dauraan manmohan singh ne yah spasht kar diya ki america ke liye bhartiyon muhaiyaa karnaa bharat kaa kaam nahin he
 The intention behind the tour, including a large convoy between two friendly nations, is to have their own interests
 saath hi isamen yah matlab bhi nihit hota he ki duniya ke saamne is rishte main chhipi takat ko kaise bhunaaya jaae
 President Obama visited India only to serve the interests of America
 aisa karne main ve kaamyaab bhi rahe
 He signed a $ 14 billion deal with India
 unhone daawa kiya ki ve 72 hajaar naukariyaan america le jane main safal rahe hai
 He also underlined that there are immense possibilities for expansion of india-us relationship
 aisa na keval dwipaksheeya vyapaar ke jariye, balki rajnatik, ranneetik or janata ke str par bhi mumkin he
 Such a close friendship between the world's largest democracy and the oldest democracy is not much older

 While groups like Jagran and Bhaskar are acquiring some of the established groups in the market, Rajasthan Patrika is expanding its regional identity to other states as the magazine
 jaagran prakaashan limited ne haal hi main madhya pradesh ke sthapit or nami-giraami akhbaar naiduniya kaa adhigrahan kar vahaan apni maujuudagi darj karai he
 Sanjay Gupta, CEO and editor of the group, told India Today, "naiduniya was a logical extension for us as it would help our strong presence in Central India

 This is the second acquisition after Midday as part of our strategic plan to expand and grow through mergers and acquisitions

 Claiming to be the country's largest readership media group, Gupta says, the group's average issue readership (IRS) 2 in the Indian Readership Survey
 06 karod he or pichley 21 baar se jaagran number van he
 "nai Duniya is also included in this figure
 madhya pradesh paramparaagat rup se dainik bhaskar kaa garh rahaa he
 Bhaskar's reputation has been to build new strongholds and preserve the old fort
 bhaskar group ke nideshak girish agarwal kehete hai, ''dainik bhaskar group eemaandaaree, nishpakshta or uddeshy ke saath chalane vaala vishwasaneey media samooh he, jo 1
 With 13 million readers, it is present in 13 of India's fastest growing markets

 "our group's average issue readership (AIR) 1," claims Sanjeev Kotnala, brand communication head of the Bhaskar Group, based on average per reader figures
 91 karod he, jabaki jaagran samooh kaa eiar 1
 78 crores
 '' bhaskar samooh isamen naiduniya, nav duniya, jaagran sakhi or jaagran josh ko nahin jodta he
 But Bhaskar has added DNA to his group's figure, which is a shared undertaking
 haalanki jaagran prakaashan li
 Basant Rathore, Vice President (strategy, Brand and Business Development) of the Jagran, claims the Jagran group as inferior to Bhaskar as factless
 ve daawa karte hai, ''iares ke mutabik, hamaare samooh kaa eiar 2
 06 crore and total readership 6

 We are India's number one media group based on both AIR and Total Readership
 "in his claim, Dainik Jagran, i Next, Mid Day (english), Mid Day (gujarati), Inquilab, Naiduniya, Nav Duniya, Jagran Sakhi and Jagran Josh is involved
 lekin in donon bade samoohon se itar patrika group bhi hindi dainikon main number do hone kaa daawa karata he
 Arvind Kalia, national head (marketing) of the magazine, says, "the magazine ranks second among Hindi dailies
 audit beuro of cirkulation (abisi) ke mutabik, hamaara ausat cirkulation 21 lakh prati rojaanaa he
 "in fact, every group looks at the figures from their own convenience and whenever the results of the IRS or ABC come up, there is a race to make themselves number one in the newspapers
 naiduniya ke adhigrahan ke baad madhya pradesh main akhbaar samoohon kii pratispardhaa or tej ho gai he
 The magazine, which has gone ahead in Madhya Pradesh to break the monopoly of Dainik Bhaskar, claims that it is number one in Bhopal, Indore, Jabalpur, Gwalior based on readership
 usne to is babat baqayada ishtahaar bhi nikaala
 In the Indore edition, Gulab Kothari, the senior-most member of the magazine family, writes, "the figures may say anything, but no one will be able to stand before the magazine to win hearts
" '' lekin patrika ko dainik bhaskar chunauti nahin maanata he

 "as per the latest IRS data, our readership in Madhya Pradesh is 3
8 million, while our nearest rival newspaper has a readership of only 1

 s
 goswami kehete hai, ''pichley 8-10 saal pehle madhya pradesh behad pichhadaa rajya tha
 But now the picture has changed and if the growth rate of any state increases, then competition also increases
 yahi vajah he ki rajya main bijness ke jariye apana share badhaane ke liye media group main pratispardhaa badi he
 As such, all these groups are already in the business of the state and economic growth has created competition
 ''jaahir he ki sabhi group vistaaravaadi niti ke jariye soobe ke sartaaj banane kii koshish main he
 The Jagran Group first made its debut in Indore in 2007
 lekin ummid ke mutabik safalataa nahin mili to ab naiduniya ke adhigrahan ke jariye dainik jaagran ne madhya bharat main apni upasthiti ko majboot karne kii disha main kadam badhaayaa hai
 The magazine group launched its launch from Bhopal on 25 May 2008
 patrika ke neshnal marketing head arvind kaaliya dainik bhaskar kaa naam liye bina kehete hai, ''madhya pradesh main patrika ke pravesh se pehle bazaar main ekadhikaar tha
 Now we can proudly say that the dominance of a particular newspaper is over

 R
 singh kehete hai, ''madhya pradesh ke bazaar main number van or do ke bich kaaphi antar tha
 But today we have become the most spread daily in bhopal-indore
 ''vaise media main varchasv kii is ladaai kaa centre philhal madhya pradesh ho, lekin isaki asli shuruyaat disambar, 1996 main tab hui thi, jab dainik bhaskar ne rajasthan main patrika kii maand main ghuskar use chunauti di thi
 Initially, the magazine did not take it seriously, but when Bhaskar presented the challenge after the battle of price reduction, the difficulties of the magazine started increasing
 kotnala kehete hai, ''jaipur main laanch ke saath pehle din hi ham numbervan ho gaye
 Our success in Rajasthan became a case study for the management institutes of the country and we are the largest newspaper in our focus area urban Rajasthan
 '' patrika ne bhi madhya pradesh main bhaskar ke ekadhikaar ko usee andaaj main chunauti di
 After this, the Bhaskar group began to challenge the Jagran group
 saal 2000 main bhaskar ne haryana main jaagran ke saamne chunauti pesh kii or iske saath hi punjab kesari ke garh maane jane vaale haryana-punjab main amar ujaalaa ghusaa
 There were many changes in price and newsprint during this period
 iske baad media ke is mahabharat main ek tehraav aayaa, par bhaskar ne ek baar phir jaagran ke prasar vaale kshetra punjab main dhaava bolaa
 After a challenge from Bhaskar in Punjab, Jagran launched the newspaper in Gurmukhi script itself
 phir bhaskar ne prabhaat khabar or hindustan jaise pramukh akhabaaron ke garh jharkhand main entry lee or ab bihar jaise bade rajya main jane kii taiyaari antim charan main he
 Hindustan, the leading newspaper of Delhi and Bihar, is expanding its presence and opening new sections, especially in Uttar Pradesh
 vahiin jharkhand ke akhbaar prabhaat khabar ne bihar main kadam badaye hai
 Acquisitions and mergers for market share also continue
 bhaskar ne ji group ke saath saajha upkram banaakar mumbai main angreji akhbaar diene laanch kiya tha, to jawaab main jaagran ne mid de, urdu akhbaar inkulab or haal hi main naiduniya kaa adhigrahan kiya
 Assuming market discussions, soon the Bhaskar group is set to bring another English newspaper with them and a tremendous challenge in Bihar, while Jagran is also eyeing a Kolkata-based English newspaper
 uski baatcheet oriya, gujarati ke saath-saath uttar bharat ke ek sthapit hindi media samooh se bhi chal rahi bataai jaati he
 Some photos of the acquisition are expected to be cleared in the next five-six months
 sirf adhigrahan hi nahin, media samooh apane dhaanche ko chust-durust rakhane ke liye nirantar prashikshan or salanaa baithak karte rahete hai
 While Jagran has maintained a calendar to manipulate marketing people, Bhaskar has joined global company Dale Carnegie

 In front of the pace of rain, unaided dams had to open their gates in June itself
 donon baandhon se chode gaye 150 lakh kusek pani kii tivrata se sukhi padi betwa nadi main ufaan aa gaya
 As Betwa swelled, large rivers like Dhasan, Yamuna and Mandakini also began to look eager to touch the danger mark
 ufaan par ai nadiyon ne bundelkhand ke kareeb 2,200 gaanvon ko prabhavit kiya he
 The coastal areas are completely submerged
 hajaaron hectare jameen pani main samaa gai he, jis par ab kharif kii fasal bo paanaa mushkil ho gaya he
 Barring Mahoba district alone, rain in seven districts of Bundelkhand has had a profound impact on public life

 Farmers' fields were submerged here, as well as water entered the houses

 Farmers here say what is the nature of this game that earlier there was so much drought that the fields were destroyed due to lack of water and now it rained so much that once the drought fields got submerged in water, houses collapsed
 har ore se tabaahi hi chali aa rahi he
 Now this is the amazing situation of Bundelkhand, in which the situation of destruction is created in every situation

 kashmir main hamaara doosraa din tha
 In the morning we were packing and ready
 aabid ne kaha tha ki houseboat par ek hi din kaafii hota he
 He advised us to stay in the hotel for the remaining two days
 uske intjaar main ham houseboat ke baraamde main baithe the
 The photos and the hawkers did not let us sit quietly
 ek ke baad ek naav kii chappu chalaate pheri vaale aapako tang kar denge
 In spite of all this, Dal Lake looked very beautiful in the morning
 bachche naav par skool ja rahe the
 Maqbool's daughter was also going to school
 uski choti bahan bhi uske saath jane kii jid kar rahi thi
 Abid had arrived
 maqbool ne hamen naav se car tak pahunchaaya
 We left from Maqbool
 aabid hamen hotel le gaya
 This hotel was a short distance away from Dal's initiative
 shaayad uske rishtedaar kaa tha
 We did not like it
 pehle usne hamen hotel paradise le jane kaa vaada kiya tha, jo dal ke paas hi tha
 We said that on returning from Gulmarg, we will take the hotel
 saamaan sahit ham gulmarg ke liye nikal pade
 Abid did not appear happier with our decision
 raste main khet-khalihaan tak main sena ke jawan tainaat the
 Seeing them standing like this also hurt
 na jane kitne dashakon se kashmir main ye sab ho rahaa he
 Don't know how many people have been killed
 siyasat chalaane ke liye donon deshon ke rajaneta shaayad chaahate hi nahin ki kashmir samasya kaa kabhi koi hal nikle
 On the way, the sign board of Uri and Sopore appeared
 ham aapas main apane ek rishtedaar ke bare main baat karne lage, jo sena main major the or kabhi uri main tainaat the
 Abid's face began to change color as soon as army was mentioned
 srinagar se gulmarg jane ke raste ke donon taraf seb ke baag or saamne himalay kii pir punjaal shrunkhlaa
 The view was amazing
 barf se dhaki chotiyaan hamen bula rahi thim
 On the way we stopped for breakfast in Tanmarg
 paranthe behad swaadisht the
 There a flock of guides surrounded us
 maqbool ne hamen bataa diya tha ki gulmarg main guide ke chakkar main mat padana
 Abid told us that he will not be able to do anything
 "ye behad aakraamak hote hai
 You guys deal with them yourself
 vaise vahaan guide kii zaroorat nahin hoti
 " do yuva guidenuma ladke to bas hamase chipak hi gaye
 He was going to pay his own rate
 "1200 rate he
 Let's give 800
 chalo 400 de dena
 "abid advised us that we should hire jackets and boots right here to enjoy the snow of Gulmarg
 guide peeche-peeche vahaan bhi pahunch gaye
 "you earn a few months in a year, you don't give that either
 isiilie ham pakistan main milane kii baat karte hai
 " is bich kaafii mol bhav ke baad kapade vaala prati jacket-boot vah 300 rupee main dene par raji hua
 At the same time, we saw a very large circle of white cotton
 baad main pataa chalaa ki wo barf he
 It was our first view of ice
 tippaniyan When we sat in the car with our jackets and boots, those guides came again
 car kaa darwaja kholkar bolaa, "har tourist aisa hi karte rahe to pakistan hi chale jaaenge ham
 It will be good
 " zaahir he yahaan ke yuvaaon ko sabzabaag dikhaae gaye hai
 The whole world knows how bad Pakistan's own condition is, but the youth here have been misled so much that they see the solution to their problems in Pakistan itself
 main khud 2006 main do maheene pakistan rah kar aayaa tha cricket series ko cover karne ke silsile main
 Then there was not as much panic of terror as it is now
 lekin tab bhi vahaan har samay dar bana rahata tha
 Even then the economic conditions of Pakistan were not better
 aaj kii to baat hi chhod dijie
 How can one think that it can be good by joining the country, which is one step forward and 4 steps back
 shaayad zarurat is baat kii he ki kashmir kaa zyaada se zyaada vikaas kiya jaae
 Open the factories so that the unemployed youth get work
 jab kaam milegaa, to unke paas gumraah hone ke liye samay kam milegaa

 The politicians of both the countries probably do not want any solution to the Kashmir problem to run politics
 raste main uri or sopor kaa sin board dikhaa
 We started talking about one of our relatives, who was a major in the army and was once stationed in Uri

 Any concrete decision is expected till today or tomorrow
 'vaise ab sabaki najar somvaar ko hone vaali ensipi kor cameti kii baithak par he, jisamen sharad pavaar bhi shaamil ho rahe hai
 The NCP gave a one-day ultimatum on Saturday
 lekin miyaad khatm hone tak ensipi ke paas koi jawaab nahin aayaa
 However, the Congress had responded to the threat on Saturday night through the media
 congress alaakaman se guftgu ke baad maharashtra congress ke adhyaksh maanik raav ne kaha ki ensipi ko 125 siton par hi santosh karnaa padegaa, varna akele chunaav ladane kaa rasta khulaa he
 Actually, NCP has got more seats than Congress in Maharashtra in Lok Sabha elections, due to which NCP is now rejecting the old formula
 ensipi ke mutabik 2004 ke chunaav main uske khate main 124 siten ai thim, lekin 2009 ke chunaav main use sirf 114 siten hi milin
 But it should get more seats in the new electoral equation
 baharhaal, somvaar ko ensipi kor cameti kii baithak he, jisamen party supremeo sharad pavaar bhi hissaa lenge
 Everyone's eyes are on whether the NCP accepts the Congress proposal or whether they both take a different route

 internet gaming, surfing yaa soshal netwarking cites ke diwane in yuvaaon kaa internet kaa craij inaki padhai, soshal life or kariyar ko buree tarah prabhavit kar rahaa he
 According to the survey, 37% of the students are resorting to internet to divert attention from their mood and study pressure
 is survey main dilli ke south east district ke 25 nami skulon ke kul 6291 chaatro ne hissaa liya
 It included students from class 6th to 12th
 survey chaatro keinternetuses pattern par aadhaarit tha jisamen sicometric scale par 15 alag-alag item yaa ketegory main chaatro ke internet par bitaye gaye samay or pattern par unako rate kiya gaya

 bielke super speshility hospital ke senior kansaltent manish jain kaa maananaa he ki aise bacchon ko bhavishya main bhi kaaphi pareshaaniyon kaa saamana karnaa pad saktaa he
 Such children are not socially active, they are nervous in public places, there is no mental growth and i believe that counseling of parents is more important than children because they need to understand that if they are giving a phone to their child What are the side effects? survey ke mutabik 19% chaatro ke 60 ke upar score mili jo ki behad chintaa kaa vishay he
 While on one hand these figures are equal to other Asian countries, it is more than that of North America and European countries
