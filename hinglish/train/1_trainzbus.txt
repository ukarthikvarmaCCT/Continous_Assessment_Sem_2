 Sridevi often shares photos with her daughters on social media

 Sridevi recently appeared in the film 'mom'
 desh bhar main ladakiyon ke saath ho rahe aparaadh par jab unase poocha gaya tha to unhone kaha tha- 'jab meri betiyaan der raat baahar jaati hai to mujhe bahut tension hoti he
 i continue to worry until she returns

 Amitabh became the father of a sage of age 75, age is 102 Please tell that this is not the first time Amitabh has been replaced by someone from this show
 iske pehle shahrukh khan ek sijan host kar chuke hai
 Not just Deepika, Kareena or Katrina, but this actress is crazy about Sachin Tendulkar tell that Madhuri has also hosted a show somewhere or the other
 unhone 'jhalak dikhalaa ja' ke chaar sijan or 'so you think you ken dance india sho' ko jaj bhi kiya he
 But Aishwarya has no TV experience
 agar aishwarya ko kebisi host karne taka mauka miltaa he to ye tivi par unka debyue hoga
 The Congress attacker is constantly on target of the Congress for withdrawing SPG protection from the Congress Gandhi family in an attempt to repeatedly surround the government in the Congress attack on SPG security of Gandhi family
 sansad ke sheetakaaleen satr ke pehle hi din congress ne yah maamla uthaaya tha
 After this, Congress is continuously opposing the government over this
 is bich khabar he ki sarkaar sansad ke maujuuda satr main SPG sanshodhan vidheyak bhi pesh kar sakati he
 According to information related to the SPG Amendment Bill, this bill will focus on keeping SPG security confined to the Prime Minister only
 bataa den ki gandhi parivaar se espiji suraksha waapas lene par congress ne satr ke pehle hi din modi sarkaar ko gherne kii koshish kii thi or baari hangaamaa kiya tha
 The government said nothing in it, this issue was strongly raised by the Congress in the Lok Sabha
 congress saansadon kaa aarope he ki sarkaar badale kii bhaavana se kaam kar rahi he
 At the same time, it has been said by the government that there is nothing political in this
 duusare din shoonyakaal main congress kaa hangamashitakaaleen satr ke duusare din shoonyakaal ke dauraan congress netaa adheer ranjan choudhary ne uthaaya gandhi parivaar kii espiji suraksha hataae jane kaa masalaa
 Asan also denied the subject
 unhone kaha ki niyam ke mutabik vishay laaen
 After this, Congress mps also walked out of the Lok Sabha amid the uproar over the issue of the SPG security of the Gandhi family being removed
 anand sharma ne rajyasabha main uthaaya muddashitakaaleen satr ke tisare din buudhvaar ko rajyasabha main isi mudde ko anand sharma ne uthaaya
 Anand Sharma said that our government is requested to keep the security of our leaders separate from politics
 subramanyam swami ne anand sharma ko jawaab dete hue kaha ki grih mantralay lagaataar khatre kaa akalan karata he
 It happened on the same basis
 upie sarkaar ke samay bhi kai netaaon kii suraksha kam kii gai thi
 Speaking on the matter, JP Nadda said that there is nothing political in this
 suraksha hataai nahin gai he
 The Ministry of Home Affairs has a manual and a protocol
 yah kisi rajaneta dwaara nahin balki grih mantralay dwaara kiya gaya he
 After attending the Saifai Festival of UP, Salman Khan has been constantly under criticism
 haalanki salmaan khan ko lagata he ki vahaan parform karke unhone kuch bhi galat nahin kiya
 He has held the media responsible for raising such issues
 salmaan khan ne is masale par 'hedlins today' se baatcheet kii or kai sawaalon ke apane andaaj main jawaab die
 Here are some questions and answers of Salman
 
 
 sawaal:salmaan, mujhe yaad nahin ki aapane isse pehle kab is tarah kisi mudde par safai pesh kii ho
 Your Facebook page has been clarified on why you attended Saifai
 aapako kyon aisa laga ki is mudde par safai deni chahie?jawaab:main aapako bataata hum
 The media needed 'spice' along with entertainment in it
 jab isamen salmaan khan, maadhuri dikshit, varun dhawan, aalia bhatta jaise staron ke naam jude hon, to media is par 1 ghante kaa program to bana hi saktaa tha, jisamen chaar 'brake' aa jate
 Question: Do you really think this happened because of 'business'? Answer: So what else is this? The kind of show we went there, we do the show elsewhere
 ham vahaan ek sho ke liye gaye the, kisi party vishesh ke liye nahin
 It is not fair to associate Madhuri Dixit with some poor children with a dance shot
 agar main andheri sports complex main parform karata hum, to ise aap mumbai or iske ird-gird kii garibi se jodakar kyon nahin dikhaate hai? aakhir upi main hi aisa kyon?sawaal:agar aap sawaal kar rahe hai, to mujhe jawaab dene den
 
 
 Answer: Let me say
 vahaan parform karne vaale har actor ne saifai main charity ke liye raashi daan kii he, isliye agar main rupee kamata hum or ise charity ke liye daan kar detaa hum, to aapako isse khush ho janaa chahie
 Question: No one is saying that only you people are at fault
 ham log sarkaar kii bhi aalochana kar rahe hai, jisane aap logon ko bulaayaa
 Answer: But it spoiled the image of us artists
 
 
 or akhilesh to siem hai, jinhen logon ne chunaa he
 i had to go there and show some respect
 sawaal:akhilesh jab saamne aae, to unhone iske liye media ko jimmedaar tehraaya
 
 
 Answer: i don't know what they said
 main kalakaaron kii baat kar rahaa hum
 None of us went there to hurt anyone's heart
 ham isliye gaye, kyonki hamen kisi ne bulaayaa tha
 We did our work and came back
 sawaal:salmaan, aap aisa isliye sochate hai, kyonki aap us group kaa hissaa the
 Look at all the things together, then see what it looks like
 tab hi aap samaj sakenge ki hamaara matlab kya he
 
 
 Answer: You have asked me some questions about Saifai, to which i have answered
 ab aage puuchhie
 Question: Why did you need to post a cleanup on Facebook? Answer: Yes, because the news media was crazy about it
 aap actors ke dance or jaruratmandon ke shots saath-saath dikhaakar bhole-bhaale darshakon kaa man badalane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 We called there, then came back
 sawaal:kya aap priya dutt ke prati bharosemand hai?jawaab:haa, kyonki main unhen tab se jaanata hum, jab ve bacchee thim
 i am aware of his intention
 ve logon ke liye kaam kar rahi hai, maine yah dekha he
 i will support them
 antarim bajet main modi sarkaar ne nayaa ghar kharidne waalon ko badi raahat di he
 On the other hand, if someone sells one house and buys two houses from that amount, then he will not have to pay capital gains tax anymore
 pehle keval ek hi ghar kharid sakate the
 This move of the central government is going to benefit people living in big cities
 ek tarah se antarim bajet main piyush goyal ne house property par teen badi raahaton kaa elaan kiya he
 First relief: If you have rented your house to someone, then it is going to get great relief
 ab kiraaye kii aamadani par TDS katautee kii seemaa badha di gai he
 Earlier, TDS was not required to be paid on rent up to 1 lakh 80 thousand rupees annually, above this, TDS was deducted on the above amount
 lekin ab is rakam ko badhaakar 2 lakh 40 hajaar rupee kar diya he
 That is, no TDS will have to be paid on rent up to Rs 2,40,000
 duusari raahjhagar kisi ke paas ek se adhik yani do ghar hai, usamen se ek ghar kaa tex dena padataa tha
 Because the income tax department felt that one of the two houses would have been rented out, and the income from it was taxed
 lekin ab piyush goyal ne ghoshnaa kii he ki bacchon kii shiksha, naukari or parents kii vajah se bahut se logon ko do shaharon main ghar hote hai
 Now people who own two houses have got a big relief, now they will get tax rebate on the interest of both houses
 piyush goyal ne loksabhaa main udhaaharan dete hue kaha ki mumbai jaise mahanagaron main log apane puraane ghar ko bechakar aasapaas ke ilaakon main apane bacchon ke liye do ghar lete hai
 But they did not get tax relief in this, similar situation is in metros like Delhi, Kolkata and Chennai
 haalanki unhone kaha ki sabhi shaharon main logon ko is yojana kaa laabh hoga
 Third Relief: Piyush Goyal has proposed an increase in capital gains under Section 54 of the Income Tax Act for investment from one residential house of a taxpayer receiving capital gains up to Rs 2 crore
 yani agar koi ab apana ek ghar ko bechakar usase mili raashi se do ghar bhi kharid lete hai to bhi long turm capital gen tex nahin bharna padegaa
 With this, the sale of houses in big cities can increase
 abhi tak niyam ye kahata tha ki agar koi ek ghar ko bechakar doosraa ghar kharidta he to us par long turm capital gen tex lagu nahin hoga, lekin do ghar kharidne par doosraa ghar tex ke daayre main aa jaataa tha
 That is, another had to pay long term capital gains tax
 nae niyam se ab ab log aasaani se do ghar le sakenge
 That is, if someone now has two properties, then both will get the benefit of capital gains tax exemption
 iske alaava antarim bajet ke jariye modi sarkaar ne bilderon ko bina bike hue ghar par tex chhot di he, unhen bina bike gharon par 2 saal tak koi kar nahin dena hoga
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the enthusiasm of Aam Aadmi Party chief Arvind Kejriwal was so high that he went to Varanasi and contested against Narendra Modi
 haalanki, wo chunaav haar gaye lekin dilli kii janata kaa AAP se mohabhang nahin hua or 2015 ke vidhansabha chunaav main use apratyaashit samarthan diya
 However, AAP, which received respectable support of Delhi in Modi wave (2014), was completely rejected by the people in Modi tsunami (2019)
 dilli ke dilon par raaj karne vaali aap kaa yah hashr kaise ho gaya, is par party kii vidhayak alka lamba ne tafasil se apni raay rakhi
 Aajtak in se khaas baatcheet main chandani chowk se aam aadmi party vidhayak alka lamba ne kaha ki jaise nattejey deshbhar main aae hai, us haalat main kisi kii bhi haar tay thi, lekin itane bure parinaamon se AAP batch sakati thi
 Lamba said that the party that stood second in the 2014 elections, which formed the government in Delhi in 2015, could have at least come to the second position in the current election, but the condition is that the candidate could not even save the bail
 alka lamba ne bataae haar ke karanwaaf kii is haar ke alka lamba ne kai kaaran ginaae
 He said that all the candidates the party fielded were unknown
 ye aise pratyaashee the, jinka parichay karaane main hi prachaar kaa kaaphi vakt nikal gaya
 Lamba said that some of the AAP candidates do have media identity, but they have no hold among the public
 ye kaaran bataate hue alka lamba ne tikat vitaran loktantric tareeke se nahin hone kaa bhi daawa kiya
 He said that no MLA was asked while giving tickets and all decisions were taken from closed rooms
 alka kaa kahana he ki agar maujuuda vidhayakon main se bhi kisi ko tikat die jate to nattejey kuch or hote
 On going with the Grand Alliance, the eroded image Alka Lamba also said that the departure of Arvind Kejriwal with opposition leaders who had united against Modi on many forums, was also an important reason for the defeat
 unhone kaha ki mahagathbandhan ke saath jane se aam aadmi party kii chhavi bigadi, lekin isse bhi zyada nuksaandaayak dilli main congress ke saamne gathbandhan ke liye jhukna rahaa
 Lamba said that such an attempt to tie up with the Congress showed the weakness of the party and sent a message among the people that AAP is not able to beat anyone
 alka lamba ne ye baat kehete hue odisha ke kshetreey dal biju janata dal ke adhyaksh naveen patnayak kaa bhi udhaaharan diya
 He said that Naveen Patnaik was nowhere to be seen standing with the Grand Alliance
 yahi vajah rahi ki aaj unhone behatar nattejey paae
 Alka Lamba said that if Kejriwal had stayed away from the grand alliance, things would have been different today
 vot waapas laana badi chunautialka lamba se aajtak
 in when asked the question whether the results of the Lok Sabha elections going to be held next year will also affect the result of the Lok Sabha elections, he said that now it is a big challenge to bring back his vote for AAP
 alka lamba ne kaha ki 2015 kaa chunaav anna andolan ke baad badlaav kaa tha, lekin aaj wo chhavi khatm ho gai he or ab sirf mohalla clinics par vot nahin mil saktaa he
 Alka spoke of improving the condition of the Congress, stating that AAP was in a weak position
 unhone kaha ki vot pratishat ke hisaab se aaj congress aage khadi he or aap kii haalat 2014 se bhi kharaab he
 Even in the Legislative Assembly of Kejriwal and Manish Sisodia, the party got very few votes
 kejariwal ke muslim vot na milane ke byan kii aalochana karte hue alka ne kaha ki is chunaav main sirf muslim hi nahin, balki sabhi samaaj ne aap ko nakaar diya he
 Counting all these reasons, Alka Lamba claimed that in such circumstances, the battle of the assembly does not look triangular
 saath hi alka lamba ne yah bhi kaha ki paanch saal tak modi sarkaar par kaam na karne dene kaa aarope lagata rahaa, aise main ab jabaki modi sarkaar phir se aa gai he to kya guarantee he wo phir kaam karne denge
 Explaining this, Alka Lamba also referred to the meeting of Delhi BJP President Manoj Tiwari and Congress President Sheila Dixit
 alka lamba ne kaha ki yah mahaj ek shishtachar mulaakaat nahin thi, balki ek sandesh tha ki dilli main kejariwal rahegaa to kuch nahin hoga
 Alka Lambakejriwal resigns with Sanjay Singh, resigning from the post of party convenor: Alka Lamba also asked him to resign from the post of party convenor, telling Arvind Kejriwal the reason for the defeat of the Aam Aadmi Party
 alka ne kaha ki kejariwal mukhyamantri hone ke saath-saath party kaa kaam bhi sambhaal rahe hai, aise main ab kisi aise vyakti ko party kii jimmedaari milani chahie, jiske paas gavarnence kaa bhaar na ho
 Alka Lamba put forward the name of Rajya Sabha MP and senior party leader Sanjay Singh for this
 mujhe AAP kii nahin, unhen meri jaruratam aadmi party or arvind kejariwal ke khilaaf mukhar hokar aawaaj uthaane ke baad alka lamba party main apana kya bhavishya dekhati hai, is sawaal par unhone jawaab diya ki alka lamba ko AAP kii jarurat nahin he, balki aap ko mere jaise vidhayak kii aavashyaktaa he
 However, Alka said that she has informally separated from the party, but will not resign until her term ends
 bataa den ki anna andolan ke baad 2012 main aap kaa gathan hua tha
 After which the party won 28 seats in the 2013 assembly elections and with the support of Congress, Kejriwal ran a 49-day government
 iske baad 2015 main jab dobaaraa vidhansabha chunaav hue to aap ko 70 main se 67 siton par jeet mili
 At the same time, in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the AAP did not get a single MP from Delhi, but the party got about 33 percent of the vote, which was twice the Congress
 lekin 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main AAP kaa vot pratishat ghatakar 18 pratishat aa gaya he, jabaki congress badhkar 22
 Has reached 5 percent

 When the trailer of Sushant Singh Rajput and Shraddha Kapoor's film Chhichhore came, people thought it would be like Aamir Khan's 3 Idiots or Karan Johar's Student of the Year
 is film ko dekhakar aapako duusari filmon kii yaad aa sakati he, lekin iskaa matlab ye bilkul nahin ki chhichhore kii apni koi pahchaan nahin he
 When it comes to college life, firstly Aamir Khan's film 3 Idiots comes to our mind
 rajkumaar hiraani kaa banaaya masterpis jitani baar dekha jaae kam he
 The film was based on the story of engineering college students and director Nitesh Tiwari's film Chichhore is also based on the story of engineering college students

 This is the story of Anirudh Pathak, an engineering scholar, Maya and her friends Seksa, Acid, Mummy, Derek and Bewra
 kahani kii shuruyaat flashbek main hoti he, jahaan aniruddh yani anni (sushant singh rajput) apane hostel main machane vaali khalabali ke bare main soch rahaa he
 Anirudh and Maya (shraddha Kapoor) have a son, Raghav, who is living the dream of engineering like his parents
 raghav hi wo kaaran he ki ye sabhi dost ek baar phir ek-duusare se milte hai
 However, this reason is very painful
 ye aapako jaananaa he to film dekhni hogi
 Sushant Singh Rajput has done a great job in the film
 ek smart student, jo chaturaai se saamne vaale ko pagal banaata he or ek baap jo apane bete se bahut pyaar karata he- kirdaar ke ye donon hi pahalu unhone badhiya nibhaae hai
 Apart from this, the work of actors Varun Sharma, Tahir Raj Bhasin, Naveen Polyshetti, Tusshar Pandey, Prateek Babbar and Saharsh Shukla are also excellent
 shraddha kapur apane kirdaar main behad khubasurat lag rahi hai
 Varun Sharma immortalized him by playing the character of Chucha in the film Fukrey
 abhi tak ham sabhi ne unhen halke-phulke kirdaar nibhaate hi dekha he
 He has always done well in these characters
 lekin is baar aap varun sharma ko kamedi karne ke saath-saath baari bharkam dialog maarthe or sahi main sens banaate dekhenge
 Varun's work is very impressive
 taahir raaj bhasin jis seen main hote hai use apana bana lete hai
 Apart from this, Prateik Babbar was also very good
 mere personal fevorett hai naveen polishetty
 His character is not only fun, but his work is equally good
 film dekhakar aapako aisa lagegaa nahin ki aap kisi film ko dekh rahe hai
 When the story of college life is going on the screen, then you are missing your school / college days
 film main panch bahut sahi he
 Very cool comedy is shown
 dangal ke diarector nitesh tiwari kitni badhiya filmein banaate hai, ye ham sabhi ko pataa he
 The way Nitesh has put this story in front and the lessons he is trying to teach is a compliment
 iskaa matlab ye nahin he ki isamen improvement kaa koi scope nahin he
 But sometimes people also need to watch light hearted movies
 film ke gane bhi badhiya hai
 This film gives a very important message to all, which is very important for today's people to understand
 baaki weekend par in chhichhoron ko dekh aao, majaa aayega

 Amidst the political form of the debate erupted over Narendra Modi's call for a debate on Article 370, Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah on Wednesday warned that any move to repeal Article 370 would merge the state with India
 Then it will open
 bhaajapa ne is masale par kaha he ki is praavdhaan kaa dharmanirpekshata se koi lenaa dena nahin he or party mahasoos karti he ki yah bhartiya nagarikon ke 'daman' kaa ek hathiyaar he
 Union Minister Farooq Abdullah reiterated that Article 370 granting special status to Jammu and Kashmir cannot be repealed
 unhone is praavdhaan ko majbootee pradaan kiye jane kii maang kii
 The National Conference leader said in Srinagar, 'no one, whether (narendra) Modi or anyone else, can not repeal Article 370
 anuchhed he or hameshaa rahegaa
 ' modi ne is mudde par bahes kii maang kii he ki kya anuchhed 370 se rajya main aam aadmi kaa bhala hua he yaa nahin
 Referring to the ongoing political controversy over Article 370 and Modi's call for a debate on it, Omar asked where he wrote in his tweet that Article 370 should not be debated
 unhone kaha, 'bhaajapa hi is mudde par apana rakh badalte rahati he
 Omar said, 'there are many misconceptions about Article 370 in our country
 aisa kaha jaataa he ki is anuchhed kii vajah se desh ke anya bhaagon ke liye rajya main jameen nahin kharid sakate hai
 This is the trick of Kashmiris to keep the rest of the Indian out of the state
 yah saraasar galat he
 Article 370 is part of the Indian Constitution, which connects Kashmir with the rest of the country
 ' He said that Article 370 is not connected in any way to the internal law of the state
 unhone kaha, 'narendra modi ne kaha ki anuchhed 370 kii hi vajah se umr abdulla bahari mahila se vivaah karne ke baavjood rajya main sampatti rakh sakate hai, lekin unki bahan rajya main sampatti nahin rakh saktin
 So i said it is wrong
 ' Omar said, 'either you are lying deliberately or your advisors are giving you wrong information
 mujhe is par unka koi jawaab nahin mila

 Today, there was a panic in the whole world when some services of Google stopped working
 jimail, google plus, google drive, hangout or calendar jaisi kuch sevaayen kaaphi samay tak kuch jagahon par kaam nahin kar rahi thim
 There is still no authentic information about whether Google services are working well in all places
 pehle aisa laga ki dikkat mul rup se google plus ke saath he
 But problems were also felt with other services, including hangouts and youtube comments
 google kii hangout ap se massej nahin ja rahe the
 Comments on a youtube app and its desktop site did not appear to load comments
 ek angreji website par chhapi khabar ke mutabik, google ne bataaya ki jimail sarvice kuch yugers ke liye ab thik kaam kar rahi he or agle ek ghante main sari sevaayen thik ho jane kii ummid he
 Shortly after this, people started claiming on Twitter the recovery of Google services

 aaj aath march ke maukey par sarkari bainkon main kaam kar rahi mahilaon kii daastaan sunaanaa chahta hum
 This is the 9th Ak of the Bank Series
 yah siries selary se shuru hui thi, lekin jab dhire-dhire mahila banker khulne lageen or apni baat bataane lageen to har din unki koi dastaan mujhe gusse or hairaani se bhar detaa he ki aaj ke samay main kya itani mahilaon ko gulam banaaya ja saktaa he
 Hundreds of women bankers have created their own situation, it is a document for any professor, any Feminist, which will take them years to reach
 bank sector main kaam karne vaali mahilaon par aaj jo atyaachaar ho rahaa he, uske liye atyaachaar behad mulaayam shabd he
 You may be thinking that i am speaking in atrocities or atrocities or in excesses, but you can also ask your acquaintance who works at the branch level in a government bank
 maine kai audio recording sune hai, jisamen riginal manager mahila or purush branch manageron ko gandi-gandi gaali de rahe hai or unpar cheekhte hai
 Thing threatens to suspend
 is dar se bahut si mahilaayein pramotion nahin le rahi hai
 They feel that the clerk is fine but there is no less exploitation
 gopneeyata kaa masalaa na hota to kai baar khyaal aayaa ki inhen public kar detaa hum
 But it is more than a life issue, so hearing has to be deleted
 ham mahila bankeron ke kisse ko apni mahila sahyogiyon kii awaz main aapako sunaanaa chaahate hai
 When i say that many women bankers, you can trust me that i have read and spoken more than a thousand message emails
 kai mahilaon kii baatcheet main yah baat nikalakar aati he ki ve pramotion nahin leti he
 Women are afraid of going to the commission
 maine ek baatcheet main jis tarah se riginal manager ko gaali dete suna he, mujhe nahin lagata he ki naukari se laachaar koi jane kii himmat kar saktaa he
 If you have the courage after watching prime time, then i will consider my life successful or the women's commission goes away
 ek episod main kaha bhi tha ki bharat kii sari mahila saansadon ko dal banaakar sarkari bainkon ke bheetar ghus janaa chahie or akele main sari auraton se batkar raashtrapati se lekar spikar ko report saunp deni chahie
 Many times in the bank series said that it is a five-minute work, it is applicable in all the ministries of the central government, it could have been decided in a meeting of only ten minutes in public sector banks
 8 march ke din se acha kya ho saktaa tha magar lagata he chairamainon kii jamaat ko apane rutabe se zyaada kisi kii takalif badi nahin lagati he
 You know any female banker or who lives in your neighborhood, you can ask
 maine jo kaha wo sahi he yaa nahin
 All these problems have increased since the pressure on bank branches to sell various types of insurance and mutual funds
 unhen har din kaa target diya jaataa he
 The computer has such software that if you do not sell 5 Atal Pension Yojana and do not put it in the system then you cannot logout, that is, the computer will not shut down and you will be sitting in the branch, because without logout you will not close the branch and go home
 Can
 7 march ke din ek bank main karmchaaree saadhe aath baje tak baithe rahe
 Banks' software may have a system that can bind you to that computer like a slave
 ise takneekee bhashaa main cso lop kehete hai
 When i wrote an article on this, there was news in the evening that today the system stopped at half past six, that is, they could go home
 iskaa matlab ye hua ki upar kii kursi par baithe log samajhane lage hai
 He did not dare to come forward, but took action on my point, thank you for this
 kai baikon ne mahilaon ke shauchalay kii jaanch or banane ke aadesh die hai
 After my series
 chairamainon ko shukriya magar shikaayat abhi bhi bahut he
 The economic condition of banks has not deteriorated by managers and clerks
 upar ke logon ne kii he
 But the banker is being hit
 enpie ke kaaran selary nahin bad rahi he, nae log nahin bhartee ho rahe hai
 Working conditions have deteriorated
 unpar bijness badhaane ko kaha jaataa he, target kaa tanaav paidaa kiya jaataa he
 The condition of United Bank of India is bad due to NPA
 is bank ne karaab pradarshan karne vaali 8 shakhaon ke liye jo farmaan jari kiye hai wo bhayaavah he
 It is even written that the air conditioner and generator be removed from the branch
 manager or dipti manager ko selary na di jaae, chuttee na di jaae
 In this sense, the horse and horse should be taken away from many ministers
 agar bank kaa enpie 6 pratishat se zyaada ho to asi chairman ke kamare se nikaalnaa chahie yaa branch manager ke kamare
 The All India Bank Association has condemned this decree as Tughlaqi
 alam yah he ki he ek bank ne mahila diwas par ek circular jari kiya
 Both male and female bankers are suffering from the target of selling insurance policies in the name of cross selling
 mahila diwas ke avasar par us bank ne jab circular jari kiya to kya likhaa or kya kiya dhyaan se suniye
 The bank has always strived for the empowerment of women and recognized their role in nation building
 mahilaayein bharat ke samaaj or arthvyavastha kaa cheharaa badal rahi hai
 On the occasion of Women's Day, we want to celebrate a special campaign for women employees
 yah tay kiya gaya he ki 7 march se 9 march ke bich elahabaad kshetra kii mahila karmchaariyon ko target diya ja rahaa he
 Where on the occasion of Women's Day, they should be freed from the torture of the target, but they were given a target to sell insurance
 kisi tyohaar ke din kaam kam diya jaataa he yaa ye kaha jaataa he ki aaj holi he, mubarak, aaj tum din bhar kaam karo
 Does it happen unhen chalis hazaar kii do jivan beemaa policy bechni he or 5 lakh tak kaa mutual fund karwaanaa he
 We did not take the name of the bank but Bank of Baroda was written on that circular
 beemaa bechney ke kaaran hi mahila bankeron or purush bankeron kii zindagi karaab ho gai he
 Some other banks have declared Mahalog in Day today, that is, you cannot go home without fulfilling the same target
 tippaniyan Many women reported that they are sent alone for recovery
 bataaiye yahaan neerav modi ji akele bhaag jate hai or vahaan mahila bankeron ko akele bheja ja rahaa he
 When these women go to the banker, there is no security with them
 main bheetar kii baat baahar laa rahaa hum, isliye pahchaan saamne nahin laa saktaa magar yakeen kiijie audio video sunate dekhte kaanp gaya
 i wish someone's heart would be swept away in the government
 koi mahila vakil dekh leti or adaalat se fact finding cameti kaa aadesh le aati
 There is a huge shortage of staff within the bank
 ek aadmi paanch aadmi kaa kaam kar rahaa he
 Apart from the bank, he is also working as insurance companies
 ye mahila banker saamne aakar bol nahin sakati magar maine unke bolne kaa nayaa tarika nikaala he
 She sends her story by writing, i make a little shuffle on my side so that they do not get caught and listen in the voice of a female colleague
 varanaa chairman log to mujhe ullu bana dete idhar-udhar kaa jawaab dekar
 Although many fathers found my series false, when they asked their daughter and daughter-in-law working in the bank, they were embarrassed to hear the answer
 unki aisi chitthee mere paas he
 i have presented this on Women's Day by talking to many women bankers, not a bank, not a woman banker, but in the hope that something will change
 isaki shuruyaat isse honi chahie ki das minute ke bheetar child care live kaa elaan kar diya janaa chahie
 i am right, one day it was honestly investigated, if the report is made, then you will know the stories that you cannot even imagine
 bank series kaa yah 9 waan ak he
 This series started with salary, but gradually as the women bankers started opening up and telling themselves, every day one of their stories fills me with anger and wonder as to whether so many women can be enslaved in today's time 
 sainkadon kii sankhya main mahila bankeron ne apana jo haal banaaya he wo kisi bhi professor kisi bhi feminist ke liye ek aisa dastauez he, jis tak pahunchane main unhen varshon lag jaaenge
 Atrocity is a very soft word for the atrocities on women working in the bank sector today
 aap soch rahe honge main atyaachaar yaa zulm atirek main yaa bhavavesh main bol rahaa hum, magar aap khud bhi apane parichit se puch sakate hai jo sarkari bank main branch ke str par kaam karte hai
 i have listened to several audio recordings, in which regional managers are abusing and screaming at female and male branch managers
 baat-baat suspend karne kii dhamkee dete hai
 Many women are not getting promoted due to this fear
 unhen lagata he ki clerk hi thik he magar vahaan bhi kam shoshan nahin he
 If there was no issue of privacy, then many times i thought that i would make them public
 magar ye ek zindagi se zuda masalaa hota he isliye sunakar dilit karnaa pad jaataa he
 We want to tell you the story of women bankers in the voice of our female colleagues
 jab main kahata hum ki kai mahila banker to aap mujhapar bharosa kar sakate hai ki maine hazaar se zyaada massej email padhe hai or baat kii he
 In the conversation of many women, it comes out that they do not take promotions
 mahila ayog jane se darati hai
 The way i have heard the regional manager abusing me in a conversation, i do not think that any helpless person can dare to leave the job
 prime time dekhne ke baad aisi himmat aa jaae to apana jivan safal maanoonga yaa mahila ayog hi chalaa jaae
 In one episode, it was also said that all the women mps of India should form a party and enter the government banks and talk to all the women in private and submit the report from the President to the Speaker
 bank series main kai baar kaha ki paanch minute kaa kaam he, kend sarkaar ke tamaam mantralayon main yah lagu he, sarkari bainkon main maatr das minute kii baithak main yah faisla kiya ja saktaa tha
 What could have been better from the day of March 8, but it seems that the group of chairmen does not feel any more trouble than their status
 aap kisi bhi mahila banker ko jaanate hai yaa jo aapke pados main rahati he to aap puch sakate hai
 What i said is correct or not
 ye sari samasya tab se badi he jab se bank shakhaon par tarah-tarah kii beemaa or mutual fund bechney kaa dabaav badha he
 They are given a target every day
 computer main aisa software he ki agar aap 5 atal pension yojana nahin bechenge or system main nahin daalenge to aap logout nahin kar sakate, yani computer band hi nahin hoga or aap branch main baithe rahenge, kyonki bina logout kiye aap branch band kar ghar nahin ja sakate hai
 On 7 March, the employees sat in a bank till 8
30 pm
 bainkon ke software main aisa system ho saktaa he jo aapako ghulaam kii tarah us computer se baandh saktaa he
 It is called cso lop in technical language
 jab is par lekh likhaa to shaam ko khabar ai ki aaj system saadhe chah baje hi band ho gaya, yani ve ghar ja sake
 This means that people sitting in the upper chair have started to understand
 unamem saamne aane kii himmat nahin, magar meri baat par ection liya iske liye shukriya
 Many banks have ordered to examine and build women's toilets
 meri series ke baad
 Thanks to the chairmen, but the complaint is still many
 bainkon kii aarthik sthiti manageron or clerkon ne kharaab nahin kii he
 The people above have done it
 magar maar pad rahi he banker par
 Salary is not increasing due to npas, new people are not getting recruited
 kaam karne ke halaat bighad chuke hai
 They are said to increase business, create tension of the target
 enpie ke kaaran united bank of india kii haalat karaab he
 The decrees issued by this bank for 8 poorly performing branches are frightening
 yahaan tak likhaa he ki branch se airkandishan or janarator hataa liya jaae
 The manager and the deputy manager should not be given salary, should not be discharged
 is lihaaz se to kai mantriyon se gaadi ghoda sab chin lenaa chahie
 If the bank's NPA is more than 6 percent, then it should be removed from the room of the AC chairman or the room of the branch manager
 ol india bank associshan ne tughluqi bataate hue is farmaan kii ninda kii he
 Alam is that a bank issued a circular on Women's Day
 cross sailing ke naam par beemaa polisy bechney kaa jo target diya ja rahaa he uski yatnaa stri purush bankeron donon bhugat rahe hai
 When that bank issued a circular on the occasion of Women's Day, listen carefully to what you wrote and did
 bank ne hameshaa mahilaon ke shashaktikaran kaa prayaas kiya he or raashtra nirmaan main unki bhoomika ko pahachaanaa he
 Women are changing the face of India's society and economy
 mahila diwas ke maukey par ham mahila karmchaariyon ke liye vishesh abhiyaan kaa jashn manaanaa chaahate hai
 It has been decided that the target is being given to women employees of Allahabad region from March 7 to March 9
 kahaan to mahila diwas ke maukey par unhen target kii yatnaa se mukti di jaani chahie magar unhen beemaa bechney kaa target de diya gaya
 On a festival day, work is given less or it is said that today is Holi, Happy, today you work all day
 kya aisa hota he
 They have to sell two life insurance policies of forty thousand and get a mutual fund of up to 5 lakhs
 hamane bank kaa naam nahin liya magar us circular par bank of baroda likhaa tha
 The life of women bankers and male bankers has deteriorated due to selling insurance
 kuch or bainkon ne aaj ke din mahalog in de ghoshit kar diya yani usee target ko puraa kiye bina aap ghar nahin ja sakate
 The comments kai mahilaon ne bataaya ki unhen vasuuli ke liye akele bheja jaataa he
 Tell Nirav Modi ji runs away alone and women bankers are being sent there alone
 jab ye mahila banker jaati hai to unke saath koi suraksha nahin hoti
 i am bringing out the inner thing, so i cannot reveal the identity, but believe me, i was shaken while listening to the audio video
 kaash sarkaar main kisi kaa dil pasij jaae
 a woman would see a lawyer and get a court order from the Fact Finding Committee
 bank ke bheetar staff kii baari kami he
 a man is working five men
 wo bhi bank ke alaava beemaa companiyon kaa bhi kaam kar rahaa he
 This female banker cannot speak in front of me, but i have found a new way of speaking
 wo apni kahani likhakar bhejti hai, main apni taraf se thodi pherbadal kar detaa hum taaki ve pakad main na aaen or mahila sahyogi kii awaz main suna detaa hum
 Otherwise the Chairman would have made me an idiot by answering here and there
 vaise kai pitaaon ko meri siries juthi lagi, jab unhone bank main kaam kar rahi apni beti or bahu se poocha to jawaab sunakar sharminda ho gaye
 i have such a letter with them
 maine ek bank nahin, ek mahila banker nahin balki kai bainkon kii kai mahila bankeron se baat kar mahila diwas par ye pesh kiya he is ummid main ki kahin kuch badal jayega
 It should begin with that child care leave should be announced within ten minutes
 main sahi kahata hum kisi din is par eemaandaaree se jaanch ho gai, report ban gai to aap un kisson ko janenge jisaki kalpana bhi nahin kar sakate
 Atrocity is a very soft word for the atrocities on women working in the bank sector today

 It is called cso lop in technical language

 Alam is that a bank issued a circular on Women's Day
 cross sailing ke naam par beemaa polisy bechney kaa jo target diya ja rahaa he uski yatnaa stri purush bankeron donon bhugat rahe hai
 When that bank issued a circular on the occasion of Women's Day, listen carefully to what you wrote and did
 bank ne hameshaa mahilaon ke shashaktikaran kaa prayaas kiya he or raashtra nirmaan main unki bhoomika ko pahachaanaa he
 Women are changing the face of India's society and economy
 mahila diwas ke maukey par ham mahila karmchaariyon ke liye vishesh abhiyaan kaa jashn manaanaa chaahate hai
 It has been decided that the target is being given to women employees of Allahabad region from March 7 to March 9
 kahaan to mahila diwas ke maukey par unhen target kii yatnaa se mukti di jaani chahie magar unhen beemaa bechney kaa target de diya gaya
 On a festival day, work is given less or it is said that today is Holi, Happy, today you work all day
 kya aisa hota he
 They have to sell two life insurance policies of forty thousand and get a mutual fund of up to 5 lakhs
 hamane bank kaa naam nahin liya magar us circular par bank of baroda likhaa tha
 The life of women bankers and male bankers has deteriorated due to selling insurance
 kuch or bainkon ne aaj ke din mahalog in de ghoshit kar diya yani usee target ko puraa kiye bina aap ghar nahin ja sakate
 The comments kai mahilaon ne bataaya ki unhen vasuuli ke liye akele bheja jaataa he
 Tell Nirav Modi ji runs away alone and women bankers are being sent there alone
 jab ye mahila banker jaati hai to unke saath koi suraksha nahin hoti
 i am bringing out the inner thing, so i cannot reveal the identity, but believe me, i was shaken while listening to the audio video
 kaash sarkaar main kisi kaa dil pasij jaae
 a woman would see a lawyer and get a court order from the Fact Finding Committee
 bank ke bheetar staff kii baari kami he
 a man is working five men
 wo bhi bank ke alaava beemaa companiyon kaa bhi kaam kar rahaa he
 This female banker cannot speak in front of me, but i have found a new way of speaking
 wo apni kahani likhakar bhejti hai, main apni taraf se thodi pherbadal kar detaa hum taaki ve pakad main na aaen or mahila sahyogi kii awaz main suna detaa hum
 Otherwise the Chairman would have made me an idiot by answering here and there
 vaise kai pitaaon ko meri siries juthi lagi, jab unhone bank main kaam kar rahi apni beti or bahu se poocha to jawaab sunakar sharminda ho gaye
 i have such a letter with them
 maine ek bank nahin, ek mahila banker nahin balki kai bainkon kii kai mahila bankeron se baat kar mahila diwas par ye pesh kiya he is ummid main ki kahin kuch badal jayega
 It should begin with that child care leave should be announced within ten minutes
 main sahi kahata hum kisi din is par eemaandaaree se jaanch ho gai, report ban gai to aap un kisson ko janenge jisaki kalpana bhi nahin kar sakate
 When i say that many women bankers, you can trust me that i have read and spoken more than a thousand message emails
 kai mahilaon kii baatcheet main yah baat nikalakar aati he ki ve pramotion nahin leti he
 Women are afraid of going to the commission
 maine ek baatcheet main jis tarah se riginal manager ko gaali dete suna he, mujhe nahin lagata he ki naukari se laachaar koi jane kii himmat kar saktaa he
 If you have the courage after watching prime time, then i will consider my life successful or the women's commission goes away
 ek episod main kaha bhi tha ki bharat kii sari mahila saansadon ko dal banaakar sarkari bainkon ke bheetar ghus janaa chahie or akele main sari auraton se batkar raashtrapati se lekar spikar ko report saunp deni chahie
 Many times in the bank series said that it is a five-minute work, it is applicable in all the ministries of the central government, it could have been decided in a meeting of only ten minutes in public sector banks
 8 march ke din se acha kya ho saktaa tha magar lagata he chairamainon kii jamaat ko apane rutabe se zyaada kisi kii takalif badi nahin lagati he
 You know any female banker or who lives in your neighborhood, you can ask

 All these problems have increased since the pressure on bank branches to sell various types of insurance and mutual funds
 unhen har din kaa target diya jaataa he
 The computer has such software that if you do not sell 5 Atal Pension Yojana and do not put it in the system then you cannot logout, that is, the computer will not shut down and you will be sitting in the branch, because without logout you will not close the branch and go home

 Working conditions have deteriorated

 The condition of United Bank of India is bad due to NPA
 is bank ne karaab pradarshan karne vaali 8 shakhaon ke liye jo farmaan jari kiye hai wo bhayaavah he
 It is even written that the air conditioner and generator be removed from the branch
 manager or dipti manager ko selary na di jaae, chuttee na di jaae
 In this sense, the horse and horse should be taken away from many ministers
 agar bank kaa enpie 6 pratishat se zyaada ho to asi chairman ke kamare se nikaalnaa chahie yaa branch manager ke kamare
 The All India Bank Association has condemned this decree as Tughlaqi
 alam yah he ki he ek bank ne mahila diwas par ek circular jari kiya
 Both male and female bankers are suffering from the target of selling insurance policies in the name of cross selling
 mahila diwas ke avasar par us bank ne jab circular jari kiya to kya likhaa or kya kiya dhyaan se suniye
 The bank has always strived for the empowerment of women and recognized their role in nation building
 mahilaayein bharat ke samaaj or arthvyavastha kaa cheharaa badal rahi hai
 On the occasion of Women's Day, we want to celebrate a special campaign for women employees
 yah tay kiya gaya he ki 7 march se 9 march ke bich elahabaad kshetra kii mahila karmchaariyon ko target diya ja rahaa he
 Where on the occasion of Women's Day, they should be freed from the torture of the target, but they were given a target to sell insurance
 kisi tyohaar ke din kaam kam diya jaataa he yaa ye kaha jaataa he ki aaj holi he, mubarak, aaj tum din bhar kaam karo
 Does it happen unhen chalis hazaar kii do jivan beemaa policy bechni he or 5 lakh tak kaa mutual fund karwaanaa he
 We did not take the name of the bank but Bank of Baroda was written on that circular
 beemaa bechney ke kaaran hi mahila bankeron or purush bankeron kii zindagi karaab ho gai he
 Some other banks have declared Mahalog in Day today, that is, you cannot go home without fulfilling the same target
 tippaniyan Many women reported that they are sent alone for recovery
 bataaiye yahaan neerav modi ji akele bhaag jate hai or vahaan mahila bankeron ko akele bheja ja rahaa he
 When these women go to the banker, there is no security with them

 Apart from the bank, he is also working as insurance companies

 sarkaar ke godaamon main pade 18 lakh ton daal ke stock ko khapaane ke liye ab mid de mile main pehali baar daal bhi shaamil kiya jayega
 Pulses will also be spent in other government schemes
 shuukravaar ko cabinet cameti on iconomic afares main faisla kiya ki sarkari godaamon main pade hue daal kii khapat karne ke liye sarkaar ke alag-alag vibhaag apane niyamon or nirdeshon main badlaav karenge jahaan bhi ho sakegaa daal kaa upyog karenge
 In addition to the mid-day meal, pulses will be consumed in government hospitals and all departments and agencies that are involved in eating and drinking
 iske alaava sarkaar bafer stock main pade daal ko khule bazaar main bhi bechegi
 States will also be provided pulses at a lower price from the market
 khan-paan se sambandhit sabhi mantralayon ko kaha gaya he ki vah apane 3 maheene ke bheetar kitni daal kii khapat kar sakate hai iske bare main report banaakar khaadya mantralay ko saunp den
 In fact, it has become a new problem for the government to consume huge stocks of pulses
 aisa pehali baar hua he jab daal kii killat ke bajaae daal kaa zyada stock sarkaar ke liye musiibat kaa kaaran ban gaya he
 In fact, when the price of pulses reached close to Rs 200 per kg last year, there was a lot of controversy about this and the government had to import pulses from all over the world to reduce the price of pulses
 pichley saal se sabak lekar sarkaar ne faisla kiya tha ki 2 xxrep 6 0 ton daal kaa bafer stock banaaya jaae taaki bazaar main agar daal kii keemten zyada bade, to sarkari godaam kaa dalbazaar menutaar kar kii daal kii keemat par lagaam lagaai ja sake
 Pulses became a buffer stock, but this year something happened that had never happened before
 desh main daal kii record tod paidaavaar hui kyonki pichley saal kii badi hui keemton ko dekhte hue kisaanon ne daal kii buvaai bade paimaane par kii thi
 As a result, the price of pulses fell to 60-70 rupees per kg and now there was a ruckus that the farmers were not getting the proper price of pulses
 aise main sarkaar agar bafer stock kaa daal bazaar main utaarti to keemten or bhi neeche chali jaati
 Lentils cannot be stocked for too long because they start to deteriorate
 isiilie daal ke 18 xxrep 5 0 ton ke baari bharkam stock ko khapaana khaadya mantralay ke liye bada sirdard ban gaya
 After Friday's cabinet decision, the food ministry is hopeful that its buffer stock will cost a lot of money

 punjab main sattashin shiromani akali dal ne somvaar ko bhaajapa rajya ikai ke adhyaksh camel sharma se bhaajapa ke purv saansad navjot singh siddhu dwaara punjab sarkaar ke khilaaf kii ja rahi bayaanbaji par apana virodh jataayaa
 a day after BJP leader Navjot Singh Siddoo accused the Akali government in Punjab of turning politics into a commercial enterprise, the Shiromani Akali Dal called the remarks against the spirit of 'coalition religion' and accused the former MP from the saffron party of Amritsar Asked to 'tighten the rein'
 shiromani akali dal kii ek vijyapti ke anusaar, punjab ke shiksha mantri or shiromani akali dal ke pravaktaa dalajit singh cheema ne bhaajapa kii rajya ikai ke adhyaksh camel sharma ko shaam ko phone kar unhen siddu dwaara kal ludhiana main ek dharmik samaaroh main kii gai 'apmanjanak tippaniyon' ke bare main bataaya
 Cheema said 'what Siddu has done is unbearable and the alliance is against the spirit of religion
 ' Earlier, on Sunday, Siddhu took a sarcasm to the Shiromani Akali Dal's slogan 'raj nah seva', saying 'for him (the Akalis), it is only 10 per cent service and 90 per cent Meva (commercial profit)'
 ' Amid pressure to resign, Lalit Modi appeared to be on a collision course with the BCCI on Wednesday when he questioned the legality of the sitting of the Governing Council scheduled to be held on Monday to decide on his future as IPL commissioner
 haalanki bisisiai sutron ne bharosa jataayaa ki modi ke adane or prakriyaagat mudde uthaane ke baavjood unhen voting ke jariye pad se hataa diya jayega
 The government is also concerned about the entire matter and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh discussed the IPL controversy with senior BCCI official Rajiv Shukla, who is among Modi's critics
 shukla ne haalanki pradhanmantri ke saath hui charchaa ke bare main khulaasa karne se inkaar kar diya lekin unhone samvaadadaataaon se kaha ki bisisiai modi ko hataane ke liye ‚Äòkathor‚Äô kadam uthaane se bhi nahin hichkichaayegaa
 The IPL chairman sought to postpone the meeting on Monday amid indications that influential members of the BCCI, including Sharad Pawar and board president Shashank Manohar, secretary n Srinivasan and IPL vice-chairman Niranjan Shah, were in favor of Modi's removal
 sutron ne kaha ki unhone baithak kii vaidhata par sawaal uthaaye or kaha ki ayukta ke rup main keval vahi baithak bula sakate hai
 Modi also wanted the meeting to be postponed so that he could prepare himself for answering the questions arising on the IPL controversy over the money and its sources during the meeting
 mana ja rahaa he ki modi ne bisisiai ko bataa diya he ki vah somvaar ko hone vaali baithak main hissaa lene kii sthiti main nahin he kyonki vah taiyaari ke liye adhik samay chaahate hai
 There are reports that Modi wanted to make public the ownership of all the 8 franchises, but the BCCI may have put his proposal on hold
 haalanki isaki pushti nahin hui he
 The IPL issue was heated after Modi's tweet last week in which he questioned the ownership of the Kochi franchise
 iske baad kendriya mantri shashi tharur ko istipha dena padaa tha
 He was alleged to have spoken with the Kochi franchise for Rs 70 crore sweat equity
 isi tarah ahmedabad ke liye videokan or adaani samooh kii asafal daavedaari or unke kuch kendriya mantriyon ke rishtedaaron ko kathith taur par sweate equity kii peshkash par bhi sawaal uthaaye gayi
 BCCI sources said that the Governing Council would not postpone the meeting and would pass Modi through voting to remove Modi from his post
 duusari taraf modi chaahate the ki yah baithak ek may ko ho jisase ki unke apane bachaav main taiyaari kaa mauka mil jaye
 Meanwhile, there are reports that after questioning the ownership issue, Modi had sent an email to all BCCI officials offering detailed information about the shareholders of each franchise
 is samvaad kii prati sabhi frenchiji maalikon ko bhi bheji gai thi
 However, sources said that BCCI President Shashank Manohar responded to Modi's dialogue saying, "ownership is a complex issue and its legal complexities need to be discussed
 sanchaalan parishad kii baithak main swaamitv par charchaa kii ja sakati he or vahiin is par vichaar kiya jayega
 Sources said that Manohar's view was supported by many members of the governing council, including Ravi Shastri, Arun Jaitley, Niranjan Shah and Chirayu Amin
 modi ke ravaiye ko dekhte hue bisisiai ne bhi kadaa rukh apana liya he or board kii media or vitt samiti ke adhyaksh rajeev shukla ne kaha ki agar jarurat padi to sanchaalan parishad kii baithak me kade faisle kiye jaaenge
 "on Tuesday, in a meeting between BCCI President Shashank Manohar and Sharad Pawar, it was decided that in the Steering Council meeting on April 26, we will sit down and decide unanimously what to do," he said
 ‚Äôshukla ne kaha, ‚Äòyah faisle cricket or bisisiai ke hit main honge
 No matter how drastic the decision will be made to save the image of the BCCI and the cricketer in the country
 pichley 60 saal main hamane kabhi apni chhavi ke saath samjhauta nahin kiya or is baar bhi koi samjhauta nahin hoga
 The BCCI is also in talks with some of the key franchises of this breathtaking league and has made them aware of the possible scenario after Modi's ouster
 sutron ne bataaya ki frenchiji maalikon kii kuch ashankaayen hai lekin bisisiai ko bharosa he ki vah modi ke bina bhi lig ko chalaa lenge
 On the other hand, a day after Modi came to the rescue, Union Minister and Jammu and Kashmir Cricket Association President Farooq Abdullah said on Wednesday that he was not defending the IPL commissioner

 niyantran rekha ke paar aatanki launch pads par sargical strike ke baad yah pavitra sthalbhartiya tirthayatriyon ke liye band kar diya gaya tha
 It was also decided to construct a proposed corridor connecting Dera Baba Nanak to Gurdwara Darbar Sahib in Gurdaspur district of Punjab

 These are some lines, written months ago
 aaj baar-baar jahan main ubhar rahi hai
 
 
 That evening was painted in the color of love since morning
 
 
 fasebuk, whatsap, instagram, bazaar, restaraan or bhi jane kya-kya isi ke surkh rang main to ranga tha
 
 
 Where i was looking, just love spread in love
 par main udhaas thi
 What happened was Valentine's Day, mind and body were not ready to support the day, understanding the fragility of the atmosphere
 subah se tabiyat kharaab thi so tay kiya ki offis se sidhaa doctor ke paas jaaya jayega
 After completing all the work, when reaching home, a bad news was received from Pulwama
 pehle se hi udhaas man main tis or bad gai
 
 
 Thinking of the extent to which a human being can hate, to what extent a person can scare his soul and take the wrong path, how can some people trick the youth by spreading terror for their personal greed and that human being only human Can kill 
 
 khabar sunne ke baad jaldbaaji main tivi chalaaya gaya
 On seeing the news, the love of western civilization was touched in the second day
 ankhen nam ho ai or man baichaiyn ho uthaa
 The pain increased when it was learned that the attack was carried out by Adil Ahmed Dar, a 20-year-old terrorist from Pulwama
 daar ne visphotakon se ladi car se siarpief javaanon kii bas main takkar maari or nafrat or kaayarta kaa aisa dhuna uthaa ki puri duuniya aatankwaad par thu-thu karne lagi
 
 
 In this suicide attack, 40 CRPF jawans of India were martyred and the groan caused by their pain across the country made the eyes of every country in the world moist
 
 
 duniya bhar ke desh bharat ke dukh main uske saath khadey najar aae
 According to reports, Adil Ahmad Dar, the terrorist who carried out the attack on the CRPF convoy, made a video message just before this attack
 jise usne apane saathiyon ke liye banaaya tha
 In this video, Dar was saying "be a part of the group and prepare for the last night"
 ' lekin isi video main daar ne ek aisi baat kah di, jisamen vah apana or apane jaise duusare aatankiyon kaa sabase bada dar dikhaa gaya
 
 
 He was told that what is the last thing that can end terrorism
 ji haa, is video main aatanki daar logon se darkhwaast kar rahaa he ki ve 'pyaar main na paden'
 
 
 One thing is clear from this appeal of Dar that if people will fall in love, then the name of the terrorist organizations like jaish-e-mohammed will be destroyed
 
 
 sach hi to he
 If this war of hatred is to end, then we humans have to learn to love human beings with our own community
 pulavama hamalaa :duniyabar ke desh bharat ke dukh main uske saath khadey najar aae
 From 14 February till today, i have remained with these martyrs through news
 mujhe sukun hua ki dukh kii is ghadi main puraa desh ek saath khadaa dikhaa
 Instead of saying what the Vipaks, the Sarkars, the Hindus, the Muslims, the Sikhs or the Christians every 'religion', i would say that every Indian paid tribute to the martyrs who sacrificed their lives
 har kisi ne apane-apane tareeke se apane dard ko jaahir kiya
 If Kiski wrote poems, Kisie exposed the pain of the mind in pictures or in her own way
 is ghatana ke baad puraa desh ekajute ho gaya
 And seeing this solidarity and unity, my mind repeatedly bowed to those martyrs, and paid tribute to every countryman
 jo dharm, jaati, raajnneeti har diwaar ko giraakar saath khadey hai
 Holding each other, every countryman is giving this message to terrorism that no matter how many days you have written in the name of love, spread hatred and give instructions to not love, this country is one and will remain one
 
 
 ham sab dharm, majahab or jaat se pehle kuch hai to hindoostaani hai, bhartiya hai
 
 
 Everyone is sharing loving messages for their country, for their army and for their martyrs
 or aatankwaad ke liye ye ek bada munhtod jawaab he
 i feel that our solidarity and love is the biggest weapon to end the terrorists
 
 
 inta pyaar baanta jaae ki aatankwaad or aatanki is desh main nafrat kii saans hi na le saken
 
 
 And reverse Pulwama attacker Adil Ahmed Dar's attempt to end his love
 
 
 aakhir aatankwaad ne bataa hi diya ki wo bhi is desh ke aapasi pyaar or sohardra se kitna darataa he
 
 
 So let's join our army by joining together, sharing love and caring for humanity

 Hrithik has said that he does not want any further delay in the production of the film, hence he is leaving the film
 ruthik is film ke saath apni film ‚Äòagnipath‚Äô ke nirdeshak karan malhotra or purv sah kalakaar karina kapur ke saath ek baar phir kaam karne vaale the, lekin ruthik ke kharaab swasthya or iske baad patni sujain se alag hone kii vajah se film main deree hoti gai
 Hrithik said in a statement, Karan Malhotra (director) and i have decided to work together in a big film after Shuddhi
 is samay main 'shuddhi' jaisi film ke nirmaan ko or aage khisakane nahin duungaa
 i have had a great experience working as an actor in 'agneepath' with Karan Malhotra
 film ke liye shubhakamanaayen dete hue kaha ki unhen ummid he ki ‚Äòshuddhi‚Äô hindi cinema main mile kaa pathar sabit hogi
 There are reports that Kareena is also quitting the film due to busyness, as Hrithik's health had pushed the film's shooting dates forward
 saath hi kaha ja rahaa he ki karan johar ke binar dharma productions kii is film main ranvir singh or deepika ko ruthik or karina kii jagah le sakate hai
 BJP President Rajnath Singh said today that the BJP will support whatever form the central government brings the bill to provide 33 percent reservation to women in Parliament and Legislative Assemblies
 congress apana vaada bhul rahi heparty kii mahila morcha kii rashtriya kaaryakaarani kii do divasiy baithak kaa yahaan udghaatan karte hue singh ne kaha ki samprag sarkaar ne 15 veen loksabhaa ke apane sau dinon ke kaarykaal ke bheetar mahila aarakshan vidheyak laane kaa aashwaasan diya tha lekin yah puraa nahin hua
 On the basis of poverty, reservation should be given
 He said that the BJP is ready to support this bill in all respects, but the intention of the Center seems to be flawed
 congress kaa charitra hi aisa rahaa he ki kahana kuch or karnaa kuch or
 Singh alleged that the Congress works to divide castes and religions and did not allow social harmony to arise in the country
 sachhar cameti kii report kaa ullekh karte hue unhone kaha ki bhaajapa dharm ke aadhaar par aarakshan kii bajaay garibi ke aadhaar par aarakshan kii pakshdhar he

 Afghanistan gave evidence against Pakistan UN Ambassador to Afghanistan Mahmood Saikal did not directly name Pakistan
 unhone kaha ki unki sarkaar ne yuanessi ko uske sankalp ‚Äòkshetra ke ek desh‚Äô ko pakistan dwaara tode jane ke saboot bhi muhaiyaa karavaaen hai
 Explain that he stressed the need for action against the 'one country' resolution as per UNSC
 saikal ne yah bhi kaha ki yuanessi sadasyon ke bich pakistan main aatank kii surakshit panaahagaahon kii maujuudagi ko lekar pehle se zyada spashtataa he or ve is par ekamat bhi hai
 Let us know that a few days ago, a 15-member powerful body ambassador-level delegation has returned from Kabul
 parishad kaa har sadsy maanata hesaikal ne pitiai se kaha, ‚Äòmaine nahin suna ki parishad ke kisi bhi sadsy ne pakistan main aatank kisurakshit panaahagahonki maujuudagi se inkaar kiya ho
 i have not heard any member of a council get up and he said that this is not true
 ‚Äôunhone yah bhi kaha, ‚Äòlekin hamen isse bhi aage janaa hoga
 We have to form a consensus in the Council that yes, they (terrorists) are there (pakistan), which will force the Security Council to take action there '
 pakistan ne mudde se bhatakayounhone kaha ki yah muddayuanescemen kai baar aa chukaa he
 Several members of the council are now speaking openly about this
 or kaha ki pakistan ne beete kuch varshon main mudde ko bhatakaane kii koshish kii he or hameshaa asafal bhi rahaa he, lekin ab pakistan ke rajaynik kii ore se aa rahe tarkon ko koi bhi sunne ko taiyaar nahin he, naa to sanyukt raashtra main or naa hi kisi anya antarrashtriya manch par
 Pakistan is the stronghold of terrorists, and Marasackal gave the example of Osama bin Laden, Mullah Omar and Mullah Akhtar, saying, 'most of the member countries know about safe havens of terror
 unhen pataa he ki aatanki samoohon ke kai pramukh pakistan main rahe, ve pakistan main mrit paae gaye
 He was killed and buried there in Pakistan
 or ab, taliban ke pramukh naam pakistan main hai

 bollywoodektorayushmaan khuranake liye ye saal kaaphi saxesphul sabit hua he
 Her film Andhaadhunne went on to gross well at the box office
 iske baad kam bajet main bani unki film badhai ho ne box offis par dhamal machaa diya
 After more than 4 weeks of release, the film's earnings are not taking the name of a halt
 film ke bare main lead actor ayushmaan khurana ne apni pratikriya di he
 In an interview given to Pinkvilla, Ayushmann Khurrana said, "this year has been a dream for me
 ek abhinayta ke rup main maine hameshaa ye mana he ki content cinema kaa bhagwaan he
 i have always preferred this type of offbeat cinema
 kyonki mujhe aisa lagata he ki ek content besd film, intertenment ke saath simple or acchhee film kehalaati he
 "ayushman further said-" People have always raised questions on the elections made regarding my films
 magar maine hameshaa kisi kii bhi sune bagaiyr khud kii chois par bharosa kiya he
 People used to warn me that i am not doing stardom games and just working on good content
 aaj main apane aap ko ek actor ke rup main velidat mahasoos kar rahaa hum jo achche content par bani film par kaam karata he or uski film ko box offis par saxes bhi milti he
 It has been proved that films made on good content are appreciated worldwide
 ''film kii kahani dilli ke kowshik parivaar kii he, jahaan ghar main pita (gajraj raav), maa (nina gupta) ke saath unka betaa nakul kowshik (ayushmaan khurana) rahete hai
 Nakula is in love with Rene (sanya Malhotra) and the romance of the two continues
 tabhi achaanak se nakul ke ghar main bhuuchaal much jaataa he
 Actually, Nakula's mummy becomes pregnant and then a lot of ups and downs in the story begin
 badhai hoka bajet takreeban 20 karod rupye kaa tha
 Talking about its box office collection, the film has 128 in five weeks
 40 karod kii kamai kar lee he
 People are enjoying this even for the fifth week of release
 film ko acchhee audiyans mili he
 The film has earned 8 crores in the fifth week
 film ne pehle hafte main 66
 10 crores
 bataa den ki badhai ho ne worldwide collection ke lihaaj se 200 karod se zyada kii kamai kar lee he
 Would you like to imagine a school where your child has to go through a metal detector at the gate, have a security check on his bag before going to the classroom, security drills to avoid terrorism after prayers, CCTV cameras all around Through which the principal and security officers are keeping an eye on each child's moments, the walls of the school are very high and the place of the grill in the gate
 It was a thick blanket of O
 agar is maahaul main aapkaa baccha kisi skool main bitaayegaa, to us par kya asar padegaa, kya hamane is par sochaa he
 By the way, this atmosphere has been created with us
 iske baad bhi suraksha ke aise sakht maahaul kaa kisi bachche par kya manovaigyanik asar padataa he, iskaa moolyankan to hona hi chahie
 a gun of merit cannot be eradicated simply by armoring the skulls
 centre sarkaar ne 2010 main bhi tamaam rajyon ko nirdesh bheje the ki skulon main suraksha ke liye kya-kya karnaa he
 It was then learned that David Coleman Headley, an accused in the Mumbai attack, had also video-recorded two boarding schools before the 2008 Mumbai attack
 nirdeshika main kaha gaya he ki agar koi bandookdhaari skool par hamalaa kare, to chaatro or shikshakon ko apane-apane kamare main hi rahanaa chahie
 The door should be locked and lay on the ground
 guard ko alarm batan dabaa dena chahie
 Doing so can save many lives from indiscriminate firing
 lekin tab kya karenge, jab peshawar ke skool kii tarah bacchon se naam poochkar goli maari jane lage
 If you read the guidelines carefully, it seems that now the schools will no longer be schools
 haalanki skool bhi kisi state-system kii tarah hi kaam karte hai, lekin ab fark ye aayega ki aatank ke naam par unhen police system kii tarah kaam karne kii chhot mil jaaegi
 Out of all the instructions that have been given, not a single one is effective in stopping the terrorist attack
 kabhi mal, kabhi hotel, kabhi aspataal, kabhi railway stesan, to kabhi raily
 Terrorists have been targeted everywhere
 bekasoor logon ko maaraa he
 Wherever you rely on CCTV will keep terrorism under control
 duniya main har aatanki hamale ke baad sarkarein suraksha bajet badha detii hai
 Government to public institutions spend billions of rupees buying electronic equipment
 suraksha upkarnon ke naam par hajaaron kii sankhya main sisitivi camere lagaae ja rahe hai
 If we had spent so much money to improve the police system, some tangible results would have come
 thane main paryaapt police nahin he
 The intelligence system is weak
 police na aadhunik ho saki he, na takneekee saamaanon se las
 Governments spend years doing all this and by then the market goes out selling billions of goods in the name of terror and security
 kya ab iskaa vishleshan nahin hona chahie ki aatankwaad ko rokane main metal detector or sisitivi se koi madad mili bhi yaa nahin
 We are watching on TV the next day, wearing a mask and carrying it under the CCTV camera to the ATM machine
 ham sisitivi se chor tak nahin pakad paa rahe hai, aatankwaadi kya pakadenge
 CCTV and metal detector sales have increased across the country after the Mumbai attack
 2008 main chhapi 'bijness standard' akhbaar kii report bataati he ki suraksha upkarnon kaa bazaar 30 pratishat kii dar se bad rahaa he
 The world is moving towards digital surveillance instead of CCTV surveillance
 is system main aap apane computer se duniya main kahin se bhi apni company yaa skool kii nigaraanee kar sakate hai
 No need for guards
 lekin hamale ke baad sisitivi dekhakar koi police ko bataa bhi de, to kya ham ye nahin jaanate hai ki hamaari police kii kya haalat he
 Do not cheat in the name of digital surveillance
 aap shahar kasbe main kahin chale jaaiye, skulon main sisitivi camere lage hai
 Standing twelve hours outside on tea only in colorful clothes with very little salary, these guards are positioned less, swinging more
 aap kisi bhi stesan par jaakar dekhiye
 How about the metal detector? puraa stesan khulaa hua he
 There are thousands of ways to enter the station for someone who arrives with dangerous intentions
 public spes main aatanki hamalon ke baad hawaii addon ne hi behatar dhang se khud ko surakshit kiya he
 Probably not only in India but worldwide
 aisa isliye ki hawaii addon kaa vyapak tareeke se aadhunikeekaran hua he
 The old is broken and the new one is made
 lekin railway stesan suraksha ke lihaaz se bane hi nahin hai
 The Hyderabad police also put up a display of safety equipment for schools
 unhen nakli dhamaake se bataaya ki kya kya hota he or kya kya karnaa he
 Some companies have also installed equipment, whose sales will increase
 police or sarkaar kaa yah ek bhi ek behad kuleen nazariyaa he
 In the name of safety in schools, we cannot be satisfied with the drills of the famous private schools of a few metros
 inhen mahanagaron main sarkari skool bhi hote hai or kai behad saadhaaran se sarkari skool
 Governments have not been able to build toilets in their schools and they are preaching in the name of instruction that you should build three-three gates, install CCTV cameras, there should be public annunciation system, etcetera
 kya sarkari skool ke bachche is desh ke bachche nahin hai
 Obviously, terrorism cannot be combated in these half-way ways
 jab sarkarein nahin kar paa rahi hai, to kya sisitivi kar lengi
 Therefore, the reasons for terrorism have to be clashed with their political religious background
 hamen us maahaul se bhi takaraana hoga, jo public spes main din-raat sampradayik or dharmik kattarta kii bhashaa ke thelne se ban rahaa he
 First of all, we are being consumed by drinking religious fundamentalism and nationalism like sugar in syrup, without understanding that this background of bigotry is useful in creating terrorism
 taliban sirf dharm kii upaj nahin he
 How can it happen that governments also give birth to Taliban, nurture them and tell the common citizen to install CCTV
 jab tak ham in kaarnon ke khilaaf antarrashtriya janamat taiyaar nahin karenge, yah samasya aise hi hamamen se kisi kii bhi jaan leti rahegi
 If you do not understand this, then put a CCTV camera on the collar of your shirt
 sabake haath main camera to he hi he
 Will this stop terrorism? rahul gandhi ne twitor par jaise hi tasdik kii ki ve congress adhyaksh nahin hai or apane uttaradhikari ke chayan main bhi hissaa nahin lenge, vaise hi puraane diggajon or yuva netaaon main rassakashi ke saath party zyada uthal-puthal main dhans gai
 The Congress Working Committee (CWC) may select the next president by the end of July ‚Äî which will be a temporary arrangement until the final stamp of election at the Congress General Assembly ‚Äî so the party has started lobbying for this important post
 punjab ke mukhyamantri amarinder singh ne 6 july ko twit kiya ki party kaa netritv kisi 'yuva‚Äô ko saunpa jaae
 Many people interpreted this as a gesture that they are asking Rajasthan Deputy Chief Minister Sachin Pilot to hand over this responsibility
 payalat amarinder ke kareebi hai
 By handing over the responsibility of national president to Pilot, his power struggle with Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot will also end
 vaise us twit ke baad amarinder se baat kar chuke seedblusi ke ek varisht sadsy ne daawa kiya ki unka ishaara umr ke saathe main chal rahe ek netaa kii ore tha
 Another senior Haryana leader said that Amarinder was batting in favor of 53-year-old Manish Tiwari
 agle din mumbai main party ke adhyaksh milind devda or pashchimi upi ke prabharee mahasachiv jyotiraditya sindhiya ne istife de die
 Deora even said that he is getting ready for a national position
 kai yuva netaa daawa karte hai ki rahul gandhi ne is ummid main istipha diya ki aam chunaavon main kharaab pradarshan ke jimmedaar akhil bhartiya congress cameti (eisisi) ke netaa unke nakshekadam par chalenge or nae chehron ko aage laane kaa rasta saaf karenge
 At the CWC meeting on 25 May, Rahul had Gehlot, Kamal Nath and P
K
 chidambaram ko dhikkara bhi ki unhone apane beton ko tikat dene ke liye party par dabaav daalaa
 a Congress MP says that even after this, none of the old veterans resigned
 seedblusi ke ek sadsy ke mutabik, devda kii najar party ke koshadhyaksh pad par he
 But it is unlikely that Sonia Gandhi will allow this position to slip from the hands of her trusted Ahmed Patel
 kai yuva netaaon ko lagata he ki patel puraane diggajon kii jamaat ke liye sanjivani kaa kaam karte hai kyonki ve sonia ke najadik hai or koshadhyaksh hone ke naate khaasaa asar rakhte hai
 The same member of the CWC says that Scindia has a good chance of emerging as the unanimous candidate for the post of president
 ve kehete hai, ''diggaj netaa raji ho sakate hai, par sonia gandhi nahin chahengi ki rahul kaa koi hamaumr or samakaleen netaa sabase oonchi kursi par virajman ho
 "the average age of the members of the CWC is 67 years and most of its elder members prefer the lesser-known elder to the position of president, so that the agitated leaders run the party as long as Gandhi takes over
" No family member gets ready
 ve 1991 kaa tajurba dohraane se bachanaa chaahate hai, jab pi
 V
 narsimha raav ne jaldi hi party or sarkaar par pakad majboot kar lee thi or kai diggaj netaaon ko darkinar kar diya tha
 During his tenure, the party was torn apart and Madhavrao Scindia, Arjun Singh and N
 di
 Legendary leaders like Tiwari left the party
 1996 ke aam chunaav main congress kii shikast ke baad koshadhyaksh seetaram kesari ko adhyaksh banaaya gaya
 But in 1998, when Sonia took charge of the party, Kesari was disgraced and removed
 tabhi se congress ke adhyaksh kaa ohada gandhi parivaar ke paas hi rahaa he
 Like 1991, Patel is leading the selection process for the new president
 kuch diggajon ne gahalot ko tarjeeh di, par unhone manaa kar diya
 Finally, as a compromise, former Union Minister Mukul Wasnik could be a possible candidate, who will turn 70 in September
 in halaat main ek vikalp yah ho saktaa he ki kisi ek diggaj netaa ko asthaayee adhyaksh, kai yuvaaon ko upaadhyaksh banaaya jaae jo kshetron yaa sanghathan kii shakhaon kaa swatantra prabhaar sanbhaalein
 Or be appointed a provisional chairman who is accountable to a core committee elected by the CWC ‚Äî but this will require amending the party's constitution
 aakhri faisla to sonia hi lengi
 And looking past records, it is most likely that she will choose loyalty over performance
 *** In the upcoming Lok Sabha elections, the main contest is not going to be between Narendra Modi vs Rahul Gandhi, but between Narendra Modi vs Arvind Kejriwal
 india today group or si-voter ke nae survey ke mutabik, 53 fisadi logon ko lagata he ki arvind kejariwal ab modi ke liye mukhya compatishan ban chuke hai
 Many such surprising results have come out in this survey
 rahul gandhi ko congress kaa cheharaa banaae jane ke elaan ke baad 16 or 17 janvari ko kul 1248 logon se 10 sawaalon par raay lee gai
 According to the survey, 40 per cent of the people are those who feel that Rahul Gandhi can win the Congress in the 2014 elections
 23 fisadi logon ke mutabik, raajnneetik samajhadaari ke str par priyanka gandhi apane bhai rahul se behatar hai
 Also, 64 per cent felt that it was late to jump into the fight against corruption

 udhar 25 karod ke bajet vaaliayushmaan khuranastarar philindhadhunako phayda mila he or darshak ise dekhne ke liye ab bhi cinemagharon kaa rukh kar rahe hai
 Talking about Lavayatri, after completion of the first week, the film has grossed about 28 crores
 ek anumaan ke mutabik film film kaa lifetime collection 50 karod tak ho saktaa he
 Talk about Salman Khan Productions' film Loveratri, it has fallen face-down at the box office
 film ne pehle hafte main mahaj 10 karod rupee kii kamai kii he
 Ayush Sharmaki This debut was a Bollywood film and its flop would obviously affect his career as well
 doosraa haftaa in donon hi filmon ke liye ab or zyada halkaa ho saktaa he
 This is because the films released this week, but Helicopter Eela and Friday will now challenge the films released last week
 haalanki inamen se koi bhi film bahut bade bajet kii nahin he lekin box offis par zyada filmon ke hone kaa ek nuksaan yah hota he ki profit sabhi filmon main bantna shuru ho jaataa he
 In Delhi's Aam Aadmi Party government, political uproar has arisen over the appointment of Health Minister Satyendar Jain's daughter as a consultant in Mohalla clinics
 gopneey tareeke se kii gai niyukti par sawaal khadey karte hue vipaksh ne kejariwal sarkaar par parivaarwaad kaa aarope lagaaya he
 The office set up for the Mohalla clinic on the ninth floor of the Delhi Secretariat is in dispute because it is being handled by none other than the daughter of Health Minister Satyendra Jain
 salaahkaar or incharge ke taur par mantri ji kii beti saumya jain ko niyukt kiya gaya he
 If the matter was about the daughter, then Health Minister Satyendra Jain did not delay in giving any clarification
 vipaksh ko mila muddam aadmi party sarkaar ne isse pehle bhi apane kaaryakartaaon or karibiyon ko ahm padon par kabiz kar rakhaa he
 Presently, the appointment of Minister Kibeti has given the opposition another issue against the government
 saal ke ant tak 1000 mohalla clinics banaaegi dilli sarkaarapako bataa den ki dilli sarkaar ne saal ke ant tak ek hajaar mohalla clinics banaaen jane kaa target rakhaa he
 The government has also made a plan to make permanent Mohalla clinics in the coming days permanent
 yahi vajah he ki mantri ji kii beti kaa pad kaaphi ahm mana jaataa he
 In Haryana, the most senior Congress leader and two-time Chief Minister, Bhupendra Singh Hooda is contesting the Lok Sabha elections from Sonepat this time
 sonipat jat bahul seat he
 This is the reason why the Congress high command has entrusted Bhupendra Hooda to win Sonepat
 bhupendra hooda kii sidhi ladaai bijepi ke maujuuda saansad ramesh chand kowshik se he jinhen bijepi ne phir se maidan main utaara he
 Although Bhupendra Hooda is fighting Ramesh Kaushik, Digvijay Chautala, the JJP candidate and grandson of Om Prakash Chautala, is causing trouble for Hooda who is making inroads in Jat votes for Bhupendra Hooda
 hooda or digvijay chautaala donon hi jaach birdari se aate hai
 If the votes of the Jats are distributed in Sonipat, then BJP can get its direct benefit
 chunaav prachaar ke dauraan haryana ke mukhyamantri manohar laal khatter ne hooda ko bahari ummidavaar bataaya to bhupendra hooda sonipat ko apni sasuraal bataa rahe hai
 Bhupendra Hooda's wife is from Sonepat
 sonipat main lagbhag 5
 There are 50 lakh Jat votes
 yahaan se judi hui rohtak seat main lagbhag saadhe chah lakh jat matadaata hai
 a visit to Sonipat clearly shows that the case is also about Jat vs Non Jat
 sonipat main ladaai 35 banaam ek ke rup main bhi saamne aa rahi he
 Haryana has socially 36 fraternities, including Jat Brahmin Banias, Dalits, backward castes etc
 jat andolan ke baad jaaton or anya birdariyon main khai kaafii bad gai he jiskaa nuksaan bhupendra hooda ko ho saktaa he
 Digvijay Chautala lost the bjp's Kishan Midda by just 12000 votes in the by-election of Jind Assembly recently
 isamen congress tisare number par rahi thi
 In such a situation, if Digvijay Chautala cut the Jat vote, Ramesh Chand Kaushik appears in a strong position with the name of Prime Minister Modi

 bhale hi agsit pole (exit Poll) chunaavon main sirf or sirf raajnneetik dalon kii haar-jeet tak simit se lagate hai
 But they were not used in the initial stages
 balki ye patrkaar birdari ke liye vibhinn masalon par janata kii nabj tatolane ke aujaar bhi hua karte the
 The credit for starting the exit poll goes to George Gallup and Claude Robinson
 darasal, jorge or robinson ne sarkaar ke kaamkaaj par america logon kii raay jaanane kii koshish kii thi
 In which he found that there was not much difference between sample and result
 kamobesh us masale par logon kii raay milti dikhi thi
 His method became quite famous
 jise dekhte hue britain or france ne bhi ise apanaaya
 In a way, this was the first exit poll adopted by Britain and France in 1937 and 1938 for the first time
 us samay hue chunaav ke nattejey kamobesh bilkul sateek nikle the
 While originally credited with introducing exit polls goes to Netherlands sociologist Marcel Vaughan
 marcel won ne 15 farvari, 1967 ko pehali baar iskaa istemaal dach vidhansabha chunaav main kiya tha
 Marcel was first in politics, but left politics and started working to find the pulse of the public
 netherland main hue chunaav main unka akalan sateek baitha tha
 However, some sources consider US poll pollster Warren Mitofsky to be the father of exit polls
 bharat main kab shuru hue agsit polbharat main agsit pole kaa khaakaa 1960 main khinchaa gaya tha
 It was prepared by the Center for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS)
 lekin 80 ke dashak ke madhya main us vakt chartered acountint se patrkaar bane pranay roy ne matadaataaon kii nabj tatolane kii koshish kii thi
 It is from here that exit polls started in India, it is believed
 shuruaati daur main jo bhi eczit pole hote the ve india today magazine main pramukhataa se chhapate the
 This trend is still going on
 loksabhaa chunaav 2019: jaaniye kya hote hai agsit pole, kaise nikalate hai aankadesaal 1996 main hue loksabhaa chunaav ke agsit pole ko nae aayam die
 Doordarshan allowed CSDS to conduct exit polls across the country in 1996
 siesds ke kiye agsit pole main kisi bhi dal ko bahumat miltaa nahin dikhaa tha
 The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) emerged as the largest party in this election, but could not win a majority
 nateeja ye rahaa ki mahaj 13 din main atal sarkaar gir gai
 After this, HD Deve Gowda and Indra Kumar Gujral formed the UPA government
 iske baad 1998 ke loksabhaa chunaav main hue agsit pole zyaadaatar samachar channelon main prakashit hue
 In this election, four major poll surveying agencies like India Today / CSDS, DRS, Outlook / AC Nielsen and Frontline / CMS in their survey showed National Democratic Alliance (NDA) as a big party but kept away majority
 jab agsit pole ke khilaaf ho gayi sari partiyanshuruaati dinon main ye opinayan pole lokapriy hue, lekin raajnneetik dalon kii ankhon main khatakane bhi lage
 So all the parties joined the tune and demanded a ban on it
 jis par 1999 main chunaav ayog ne baqayada ek akjicutive order ke tahat opinian pole or eczit pole ko bain kar diya
 Against this, a newspaper challenged this order of the Commission in the Supreme Court
 court ne is aadesh ko nirast karte hue kaha ki ayog ke paas aise order jari karne kii shakti nahin he or kisi masale par sarvadaleey sarvasammati uske khilaaf kanoonee pratibandh kaa aadhaar nahin hoti he
 Exit Polls resumed with some reshuffle Just before the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, there was a demand to ban the exit poll once again
 jis par chunaav ayog ne kanoon mantralay ko pratibandh ke sandarbh main kanoon main badlaav ke liye turant ek adhyadesh laae jane sambandhi patr likhaa
 In 2009, the Congress-led UPA government amended the Representation of People Act, 1951
 sanshodhit kanoon ke anusaar chunavi prakriya ke dauraan jab tak antim vot nahin pad jaataa, eczit pole nahin dikhaae ja sakate hai
 According to this law, through any medium, one can neither show nor publish the results of the poll
 agsit pole ke baad ab opinian pole par pratibandh kii talwaar bhi lataki hui he
 Exit Poll 2019: Know exit poll or post poll in Lok Sabha elections, who is accurate and reliable? Which countries have exit poll? Many democratic countries of the world have different opinion about exit poll
 kuch ise sahi or kuch galat tehraate hai
 Countries like Belgium, Denmark, Germany and Ireland have an open exemption to exit polls while exit polls are allowed in China, South Korea and Mexico with certain conditions
 kya agsit pole kaa matadaataaon par asar padataa he?is daleel par duniya bhar ke visheshgyon kii ek raay nahin he
 Some people reject it, and some believe that it is not right to ban the voters because of their impact
 is par prasiddh arthshaastri or france kii siariasti sanstha ke mansa patanam ne ek vyapak shodh kiya tha
 The 60-page paper, titled 'learning from Exit Polls in Sequential Elections: Evidence from a Policy Experiment in India', examines the change in the behavior of voters by the impact of exit polls

 In the Vidarbha region of Maharashtra, fed by the poverty and fall in cotton prices, three more farmers under debt committed suicide on Thursday
 yah jaankaree ek saamaajik kaaryakarta ne shuukravaar ko di he
 Kishore Tiwari of Vidarbha Jan Andolan Samiti said that Gajanan Thorat, a resident of Garam Mehsal in Washim district, Kamalabai Chavan of Wadner in Yavatmal district and Gajanan Ghotekar of Kothoda committed suicide between Thursday and Friday
 tiwari ne kaha ki kisaanon ne isliye aatmahatya kii, kyonki niryaat par pratibandhon ke kaaran kapaas kii keemten achaanak neeche aa gayi, or isliye bhi kyonki sarkaar kii ore se unhen koi aarthik sahaayta nahin mili
 Tiwari said that a farmer Gotekar wrote in his suicide note, 'don't vote for congress-nationalist Congress Party
 
 
 donon dal is desh ko chaupat kar denge
 According to Tiwari, the Maharashtra government announced a relief package of Rs 2,000 crore for cotton farmers last December
 'lekin abhi tak sankatagrast kisaanon ko ek bhi paise kaa bhugtan nahin hua or ve lagaataar karj ke boj se dabe ja rahe hai
 Tiwari said that at that time farmers were suffering due to stricter export rules, due to which the price of raw cotton fell from Rs 4,200 per quintal to 3,400 per quintal
 tiwari ne kaha ki jab desh main 330 lakh ganth kapaas kaa utpaadan hota he or gharelu khapat keval 200 lakh ganth kapaas kii hi he, aise main niryaat par pratibandh lagane kaa koi kaaran nahin banataa
 It is to be known that the sequence of farmer suicides continues in Vidarbha and in 2011, 918 farmers have committed suicide in this area

 'bricks summit' ke dauraan ek dilachasp baithak kii jaankaree aa rahi he
 Nepal media has reported that during the meeting of Nepali Prime Minister Pushp Kamal Dahal and Chinese President Xi Jinping, Prime Minister Modi also reached there and held talks with both of them for a while
 tippaniyan According to sources, this was not a formal tripartite meeting
 pradhanmantri modi dahal or shi se tab mili jab ye donon hotel taj akzotica ke lounj main the
 India's Foreign Ministry has not said anything on this meeting so far
 shanivaar raat ko hui yah mulaakaat kareeb 20 minute tak chali
 Dahal's wife Sita Dahal is also seen sitting with the leaders in the photo of this meeting published in Nepali media
 nepali media report ke mutabik, dahal ne modi or shi se mukhaatib hote hue yah kaha ki nepal is kshetra kii do badi taaqaton ke bich main he or donon se saath or sahyog ke bina nepal ko tarakkee or khushhaali nahin mil sakati
 Significantly, the bilateral meeting between Nepal and China was decided long ago and it was also announced, but no information was given that the Prime Minister of India will participate in any form
 nepal or bharat ke sambandh ne haal ke samay main kai utaar-chadhaav dekhe hai
 Particularly during the tenure of the previous Prime Minister KP Oli, there was considerable resentment among the Madheshis of Nepal for implementing the new constitution
 ise lekar hue andolan ke chalate bharat se nepal ko jane vaali supplai ruk-si gai
 Nepal had considered the hand of the Indian government behind this
 haalanki prachand ke satta main aane ke baad rishte patari par laute hai
 Prachanda chose India for his first foreign trip after assuming the office of Prime Minister
 isse yah sandesh gaya ki nepal ne china ke prati apane jhukaav ko santulit kar liya he, lekin prachand ke bharat aane ke faisle se china itnaa naaraaz hua ki shi kii prastaavit nepal yatra ko sthagit kar diya gaya, haalanki china kii taraf se yah kaha gaya ki jab daure kaa koi aupchaarik elaan hi nahin hua tha to sthagit karne kaa sawaal kahaan uthta he
 It is also believed that the delay by Nepal in giving its consent to China's One Belt One Road project was also the reason for China's displeasure
 pichley saal aae vinaashkari bukamp ke baad nepal ke purnirmaan main bharat ke saath-saath china ne bhi apni badi bhoomika kii peshkash kii
 Nepal also needs both of them, so Prachanda is believed to have tried to strengthen both the countries during this meeting, although China is constantly trying to increase its influence in Nepal, while India is concerned about China's influence in Nepal
 The three leaders have been having their concerns so this meeting of the three leaders is being seen from the perspective of their respective interests of the three countries
 sutron ke mutabik, yah koi aupchaarik tripaksheeya baithak nahin thi
 Prime Minister Modi met Dahal and Xi when both of them were in the lounge of Hotel Taj Exotica
 bharat ke videsh mantralay ne ab tak is mulaaqaat par kuch nahin kaha he
 The meeting on Saturday night lasted for about 20 minutes
 nepali media main chhapi is mulaakaat kii tasviir main dahal kii patni sita dahal bhi netaaon ke saath baithi nazar aa rahi hai
 According to a Nepali media report, Dahal has spoken to Modi and Xi that Nepal is in the middle of two major powers in the region and that Nepal cannot get progress and prosperity without further cooperation from both
 gauratlab he ki nepal or china ke bich dwipaksheeya mulaaqaat bahut pehle hi tay ho chukaa thi or iskaa elaan bhi kiya ja chukaa tha, lekin isamen bharat ke pradhanmantri kisi bhi rup main hissaa lenge is baat kii koi jaankaree nahin di gai thi
 The relationship between Nepal and India has seen many ups and downs in recent times
 khaastaur par pichley pradhanmantri capi oli ke kaarykaal ke dauraan nepal ke nae samvidhan ko lagu karne ko lekar vahaan ke madheshiyon main kaaphi naaraazgi dekhi gai
 Due to this movement, supplies from India to Nepal were halted
 nepal ne iske peeche bharat sarkaar kaa haath mana tha
 However, the relationship has come back on track after Prachanda came to power
 prachand ne pradhanmantri kaa pad sanbhaalane ke baad apni pehali videsh yatra ke liye bharat ko chunaa
 This led to the message that Nepal had balanced its inclination towards China, but Prachanda's decision to come to India annoyed China so much that Xi's proposed visit to Nepal was postponed, although it was said on behalf of China As to where the question of postponement arises when there was no formal announcement of the tour
 yah bhi mana ja rahaa he ki china ke van belt van road project par apni sahmati dene main nepal kii taraf se kii ja rahi deree bhi china kii naaraazgi kii vajah rahi
 India as well as China offered a greater role in Nepal's reconstruction after the devastating earthquake last year
 nepal ko bhi in donon kii zarurat he isliye mana ja rahaa he ki prachand ne is mulaaqaat ke dauraan donon deshon ko saadhane kii koshish kii, haalanki china kii koshish nepal main lagaataar apane prabhaav ko badhaane kii he jabaki nepal main china ke prabhaav ko lekar bharat kii apni chintaaen rahi hai isliye teen netaaon kii is mulaakaat ko teenon deshon ke apane-apane hit ke nazariye se dekha ja rahaa he
 However, the relationship has come back on track after Prachanda came to power
 prachand ne pradhanmantri kaa pad sanbhaalane ke baad apni pehali videsh yatra ke liye bharat ko chunaa

 In protest against the delay in approving the Special Court Bill passed by the Central Government in the State Legislative Assembly, Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan, following the footsteps of Anna Hazare, has said that if the bill is not approved soon, they can keep a silent fast at Rajghat Huh
 chouhan ne isse pehle is vidheyak ko sheeghra manjuuri dilaane ke silsile main pichley raashtrapati pratibha patil se mulaakaat kii
 In this regard, Union Home Minister P

 Talking to reporters before going to Delhi, the Chief Minister said that if there is a delay in approving this bill by the Center, then they will keep a silent fast

 Just a few days ago, the Supreme Court, giving a shock blow to the Narendra Modi government of the Center, canceled President's rule in Uttarakhand and restored the Harish Rawat government of the Congress there, and on Wednesday, giving another blow in Arunachal Pradesh, the President also there Terming the rule as 'illegal', the Nabam Tuki government of the Congress has been restored

 At the same time, the statement issued by the Madhya Pradesh Police has termed Soni and Sudarshan as immaculate
 madhyapradesh police ke bayaan main saaf kaha gaya he ki vyapam ghotaale main sudarshan or suresh soni kaa naam jodna niraadhaar he, media kii kayaasabaaji he
 Let us tell you that the name of these leaders was not taken by anyone but one accused of the scam, Mihir
 empi police ne jis aanan-fanan main in netaaon ko clin chit di usase kai sawaal uthne lage hai
 In a statement to STF, one of the accused in the scam, Mihir, admitted that he had deep rapport with union leaders and was a man of Suresh Soni
 mihir ne estf ko die bayaan main suresh soni ke saath sudarshan kaa bhi naam liya tha
 On the other hand, Sangh leader Suresh Soni, surrounded by allegations, says that the media trial should be closed on this matter
 suresh soni kii maane to unke khilaaf raajnneetik sajeesh ho rahi he
 When asked Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat, he only said that the law will do its job
 sawaal uthta he ki jab ghotaale kaa aaropee estf ke saamne sangh netaaon kaa naam le rahaa he to phir puure maamle kii tahakikat kiye bagaiyr unhen clin chit kyon?vyapam ghotaale main congress ne soobe ke mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan or unke rishtedaaron ko bhi ghasita he or ab sawaalon ke ghere main hai sangh ke do bade netaa
 But the haste by the Madhya Pradesh Police has given a clean chit to both of them is bound to be questioned

 harbhajan singh ne test cricket main 400 wicket puure kar liye hai
 His 400th victim became Curlton Boy
 is test se pehle harbhajan ke 398 wicket the lekin guuruuvaar ko lunch ke baad jaldi-jaldi do wicket lekar unhone ye karnama kar dikhaaya
 With this, he became the third Indian to take 400 wickets
 mauka special he jo jashn bhi special hona hi chahie, to bhajji ne dil khol ke jashn manaaya
 There are two reasons to celebrate
 ye kamyaabi unhen apane 31wein berthde se thik ek din pehle mili he
 Although the magic of Bhajji's name has been going on for the last ten years, but this success has truly made this lion king
 kyonki ye wo mukaam he jo abtak duniya ke kuch hi gendbaazon ko naseeb hua he
 Bhajji is only the third bowler to have done such a feat, especially in India
 bhajji se pehle ye kamaal sirf kapil or kumble hi kar sake the
 Bhajji has included his name in the list of these veterans with his might
 bhajji ek maamle main kapildev se bhi aage hai
 Kapil touched this 400 in 115 Tests, Bhajji did this feat in 96 Tests
 is maamle main bhajji se tej sirf kumble hi rahe hai
 Bhajji would have proved faster than Kumble if he had not had a bad phase in 2006 and 2007
 khayr bhajji abhi 31 ke hue hai or unhen khud ko sabase behatar sabit karne ke abhi bahut maukey milenge
 This is also why his hunger and pace of taking wickets is increasing
 301 se 400 wicket lene main unhen sirf 24 test lage hai
 That is, they are enjoying hunting more than ever before
 itnaa hi nahin videshi jameen par bhi bhajji kaa dabadabaa badha he, ab wo saport gendbaaz kii tarah nahin ek strike gendbaaz tarah khel rahe hai
 Now they are doing a quick attack regardless of the pitch

 is baar purvanchal main kai bahubali netaa chunaav nahin lard rahe hai lekin charchaa he ki bahubali netaa or purv saansad dhananjay singh ek baar phir jonpur seat se chunavi maidan main utar sakate hai
 Dhananjay Singh can contest this seat on behalf of NDA
 guuruuvaar ko hi endie main shaamil nishad party ke tikat par vah jonpur seat se chunaav lard sakate hai
 However, it has not been decided yet how many seats the Nishad Party will get nor is anyone willing to speak openly
 mahagathbandhan main yah seat basapa ke khate main hote hue bhi uljhi hui he
 BJP candidate k p Singh won the Jaunpur seat in the Modi wave last time, surprising everyone
 bijepi is baar bhi is seat par kabja jamaana chaahati he lekin abhi tak party kii ore se is seat par kisi ummidavaar ke naam kaa elaan nahin kiya he
 At the same time, BJP has played a big bet on the second reserved Lok Sabha seat of Jaunpur district
 yahaan se bijepi ne apane maujuuda saansad kaa tikat katkar kuch hi din pehle party main shaamil hue beepi saroj ko ummidavaar banaaya he
 After this, everyone's eyes are on Jaunpur seat
 dhananjay singh ko is party kaa mil saktaa he saathpurvanchal ke bahubali netaa dhananjay singh pehali baar 2009 main basapa ke tikat par jitkar loksabhaa pahunche the
 Dhananjay Singh contested independent elections in 2014 but lost in the Modi wave
 ek baar phir dhananjay singh chunaav ladane kii taiyaari main hai lekin is baar vah nirdaleey chunaav nahin ladanaa chaahate
 Dhananjay Singh's direct entry into BJP is difficult, in such a situation he is preparing to contest as NDA candidate through Nishad Party
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki endie main shaamil nishad party ko bijepi upi kii jonpur or bhadohi kii seat de sakati he
 The Jaunpur seat has a large number of voters from Rajput, Kewat and Yadavas
 bijepi ne bhadohi seat par maujuuda saansad birendra singh mast kii seat badal di he
 The party has now made him a candidate by cutting ticket of sitting MP Bharat Singh from Ballia
 birendra singh mast ko duusare loksabhaa kshetra main bheje jane ke baad is baat kii charchaa joro par he ki bijepi yah seat apni sahyogi nishad party ko de sakati he
 With this, BJP can also give Jaunpur seat to Nishad Party
 bijepi ke liye aasaan nahin he is baar jonpur seatpichley kai loksabhaa chunaavon se yah seat aisi rahi he ki jahaan jeet ke liye bijepi or congress ko acha-khaasaa sangharsh karnaa padataa he
 In 2014, BJP won this seat in Modi wave but in 2019 the situation is not like this
 is baar sapa or basapa donon dal saath aa gaye hai or in donon hi dalon ke voton ke mil jane ke baad is seat par bijepi kii raah aasaan nahin he
 Till now there has been a triangular contest between BJP, BSP and SP, BJP can bet on Dhananjay Singh with the help of its ally Nishad Party
 sapa - basapa main bhi is seat ko lekar asamanjasmahagathbandhan main yah seat basapa ke khate main ai he lekin donon dalon ke bich is seat ko lekar adla-badali kii baat chal rahi he
 SP Patron Mulayam Singh Yadav is continuously pressurizing Akhilesh Yadav to give ticket to Parasnath Yadav
 bispi jonpur seat ke badale sapa se baliya seat badalane ko taiyaar he lekin akhilesh yadav us seat ko lekar bhi asamanjas main hai
 Former Prime Minister Chandrashekhar's son Neeraj Shekhar is a contender for the Ballia Lok Sabha seat and he has also previously been an MP from this seat
 2014 ke chunaav main bispi hi duusare number par thi or haar-jeet kaa antar lagbhag dedh lakh voton kaa tha
 sp's Parasnath Yadav was third from here and received one lakh 80 thousand votes
 haalanki yah tay ho gaya he ki is baar jonpur seat par sapa ke tikat par hi mahagathbandhan kaa ummidavaar hoga
 a new research has shown that men can never be just friends of women
 shodhakartaaon kaa kahana he ki purushon kii mahilaon ke saath dosti sirf younaksharn ke kaaran hoti he
 As reported by the Daily Mail, on the other hand, women treat friendship with men in a fruitless manner
 ve unase kuch zyada kii ummid tabhi karti hai jab unka swayan kaa rishta mushkil main ho
 The 1989 Hollywood film When Harry Met Style also explains this
 film main harry kii bhoomika nibhaa rahe billy crystal style kii bhoomika main meg reyaan se kehete hai, ‚Äòpurush or mahila kabhi bhi dost nahin ho sakate kyonki is rishte main sex kaa kuch na kuch ansh rahata hi he
 '88 young couples were included in this survey
 shodh main purushon main mahila mitron ke prati aaksharn kii pravriti zyada dikhi chaahe ve kisi ke saath sambandh main the athwa nahin
 While the same level of attraction towards male friends was also seen in a woman already in a relationship with a man and a single woman
 lekin sambandh main rah rahi mahila, purush mitra ke prati tabhi akshirt hoti he jab uskaa khud kaa sambandh mushkil main ho
 Most women are less interested in men who are already in a relationship with someone
 yah adhyayan ‚Äòsoshal and personal relationships‚Äô kii patrika main prakashit hua he

 goa ke mukhyamantrimanohar parrikarke kharaab swasthya kii vajah se uthe siyaasi sankat ke bichvidhansabhaamein sabase bade dal congress ko sarkaar banane kii sambhaavna najar aane lagi thi
 But this bet of the Congress backfired ahead of BJPK Chanakya Amit Shah when two Congress mlas decided to resign from the party and join BJP
 ye hagovavidhansabha kaa ganitcongress ke do vidhayakon ke istife ke baad 40 sadasyeey goa vidhansabha kii sankhya ghatakar 38 ho gai or sabase bade dal congress ke 16 vidhayakon kii sankhya ghatakar 14 ho gai
 Looking at the latest state of the assembly, the congress-bjp has 14 mlas, 3 of Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party, 3 of Goa Forward Party, 3 Independents and 1 MLA of NCP
 parrikar ke baad bijepi kii mushkil?mukhyamantri manohar parrikar kii tabiyat lagaataar najuk hone ke baavjood bijepi unhen mukhyamantri banaae rakhaa
 The reason behind this is that the parties supporting the BJP are not ready to accept any leader other than Parrikar
 gauratlab he ki mukhyamantri manohar parrikar kii sweekaaryata ko dekhte hue hi unase desh ke raksha mantri kaa prabhaar waapas lekar goa kii kaman saunpi gai thi
 Let me tell you that a few months ago, an effort was made by the BJP to call a meeting of the Legislature Party and elect someone else as the leader, but the BJP pulled back
 mukhyamantri parrikar dilli ke ames se apane gaanv laut chuke hai or unke swasthya ko lekar sthiti saarvajanik taur par spasht nahin he
 In Goa, the opposition Congress was constantly demanding Governor Mridula Sinha to prove his majority by convening a special session in view of the state's constitutional crisis
 isi sandarbh main congress ne somvaar ko raashtrapati ko gyaapan likhakar unhen taaja sthiti se avgat karaayaa tha
 This is the bjp's strategy: BJP has become active once again in the face of increasing pressure from the Congress and the controversy about Manohar Parrikar's health
 jaahir he party goa kii satta apane haath se nahin jane dena chaahati
 And there is no time when assembly elections are going to be held in five states
 lihaaja aisi sthiti main bijepi is ranneeti par kaam karti dikh rahi he ki yadi parrikar ke alaava kisi or ko netaa chun liya jaataa he to vidhansabha main party ko bahumat sabit karnaa hoga
 In such a case, if the parties supporting the BJP refused to consider anyone other than Parrikar as a leader, then how will it be compensated? With the resignation of two Congress mlas Dayanand Sopte and Subhash Shirodkar, the Legislative Assembly's strength has come down to 38
 lihaaja ab bahumat sabit karne ke liye 19 vidhayakon kii aavashyaktaa hogi
 Such mlas will leave the path of majority, these mlas joining the BJP claim that more Congress mlas may leave the party in future
 yadi in vidhayakon kaa daawa sahi sabit hua tab bijepi ko anya netaa kii aguwai main sarkaar banane ke liye bahumat sabit karne main mushkil nahin hogi
 Therefore, once again, Congress will continue to shake hands in front of BJP President Amit Shah's Chanakya policy
 gauratlab he ki farvari 2017 main hue goa vidhansabha chunaavon main 16 vidhayakon ke saath congress sabase bada dal banakar ubhari thi
 But the BJP with 14 mlas formed the government with the support of 9 other mlas and the Congress kept on watching

 13 small and large rubber boats were spotted around Akhnoor, Kathua on the international border
 isi alert ke baad gurej sector ke aasapaas suraksha kadi kar di gai he
 Apart from this, the path of the river can be used on the Krishna valley to infiltrate by terrorists
 gauratlab he ki 2011 main bhi aatanki isi raste se bharat main ghuse the
 Just a few days ago, there was an alert that terrorists could use the sea route to enter India, so there was a naval alert on the sea routes
 ab iske baad agenciyaan is baat ko lekar bhi alert par hai ki aatanki choti nadi-naharon ke raste se bhi ghuspaith kar sakate hai
