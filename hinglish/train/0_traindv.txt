 According to the Panchang, in the year 2018, the Chaturdashi date of the month of Falgun starts on February 13 from 10 to 22 minutes, which will continue till 12: 17 at 14 on February 14
 isi kaaran is varsh yah tithi do ratriyon tak rahegaa
 This year, celebrating Mahashivaratri on February 13 will be auspicious
 kaha ja rahaa he ki gaurishankar mandir or markareshwar mandir sahit kai anya mandiron main mahashivaratri 13 farvari ko manaai jaaegi, jabaki anya mandiron main abhi tak is par koi nirnay nahin liya gaya he
 That is why it is celebrated a lot of stories about shivaratri-shivaratri
 vivaran miltaa he ki bhagwati parvati ne shiv ko pati ke rup main paane ke liye ghanghor tapasya kii thi
 According to mythology, this resulted in the marriage of Lord Shiva and Mother Parvati to Falgun Krishna Chaturdashi
 vahiin garud puraana main is din ke mahatv ko lekar ek anya katha kahi gai he, jiske anusaar is din ek nishadaraaj apane kute ke saath shikaar khilne gaya kintu use koi shikaar nahin mila
 Tired of hunger and thirst, he went to the bank of a pond, where there was Shivling under the Bilva tree
 apane sharir ko aaraam dene ke liye usne kuch bilva-patr tode, jo shivlinga par bhi gir gaye
 To clean his feet he sprinkled pond water on them, some drops of which also fell on the Shivling
 aisa karte samay uskaa ek tir neeche gir gaya; jise uthaane ke liye vah shiv ling ke saamne neeche ko jhukaa
 In this way, he inadvertently completed the entire process of Shiva-worship on Shivratri day
 mrityu ke baad jab yamadut use lene aae, to shiv ke ganon ne uski raksha kii or unhen bhaga diya
 When ignorance is such a wonderful fruit of worshiping Lord Shankar on Mahashivaratri day, how much more fruitful Devadhidev Mahadev's worship will be, understandably worshiping Shivratri method - get Lord Shankar bathed with panchamrit on Shiva night

 But when the BJP got a sense of it, he stopped getting attention within the party
 majabuuran lakshmana singh ko congress main lautnaa padaa
 Rebellion against Sonia, Rahul too? Earlier on 26 April, another tweet by Laxman Singh triggered the Congressmen's friction
 unhone likhaa tha ki modi congress ko khatm kar rahe hai lekin agar wo kuch congressi netaaon ko jail main daal den to congress ke naseeb badal sakate hai
 If Soniaji and Rahulji go to jail like Indiraji, the Congress will come back very soon

" '' beshak kai baar unke man main shaq paidaa hota tha ki yah sahi tarika he yaa nahin, par jaise-jaise vakt bitta gaya kundu dampati khush hai ki unhone varnika or saatvika ko taraashne kii koshish nahin kii
 Therefore, when Varnika initially showed interest in music, Kundu promoted it and with her knowledge of Physics (before she joined the Civil Service, Punjab University of Chandigarh), she also helped in making Varnika's first audio mixer
 
 chah saal pehle jab varnika ne phulatime deje banane kaa faisla kiya, to mata or pita, donon ne unki kariyar kii li se hatakar pasand kaa khushi-khushi samarthan kiya
 She debuted as the first and only female DJ from Chandigarh at the newly opened Girl in a Cafe restaurant at the time
 varnika ab chandigarh or dilli main pradarshan karte hue freelans karti hai
 She also performs music compositions inspired by groups such as Radiohead and Flying Lotus 
 varnika ne apane liye jo kshetra chunaa he, usamen unhen der raat tak kaam karnaa padataa he or yah der raat aksar subah tak khinch jaati he
 But the Kundu sisters have always been encouraged to be independent and fearless
 barason pehle mom or dead sahit puure parivaar ne ek saath choi kwang do (marshall art taikwando kaa kahin zyada saumy rup) sikhkar apane-apane blike belt hasil kiye the
 Therefore, there was no such thing that Varnika or her parents were particularly concerned about driving to Delhi or Gurgaon or driving back to Chandigarh for a program
 kundu parivaar main dinar kii mej par hone vaali baatcheet main kabhi yah vishay nahin uthaa ki varnika ne jo kariyar chunaa he, usase kya pareshaaniyaan aa sakati hai
 The conversation was always about what they should do if things got worse: exactly what they did when Vikas Barala and Ashish tried to abduct them in Chandigarh on the night of 4 August
 takreeban kisi bhi duusari aurat yaa ladki kii tarah varnika ne pehle bhi isse kuch milti-julati haalaton kaa saamana kiya he
 She says, "i'm never scared
 '' ek maukey par to unki maa khaas taur par ek aditol or aakraamak cycle savaar aadmi kii taak main haath main danda liye unke peeche-peeche ai thim
 She says, "boys, men will come after you, but as soon as they see you talking on the phone (asking for help) or if they see a PCR car, they usually stop chasing you at that very moment
" Will give ''vah raat magar alahada thi
 They had no idea of who they were, but Varnika had no doubt about her intentions
 esayuvi kii sawari seat par baitha aadmi (ashish) peechha karne ke dauraan do baar utarkar aayaa or usne jabaran varnika kii car kaa darwaja kholane kii koshish kii
 "they were shameless," she recalls
 sector 26 main or houseing board chowk, jahaan ve pakade gaye donon jagahon par unhen saaf taur par virodh kiye jane kaa koi dar nahin tha or unhone duusari gadipoon main savaar logon kii khuli najaron ke saamne varnika kii car main ghusane kii koshish kii
 In a state of complete shock, Varnika, on her Facebook page the next morning, described the condition of that dreaded night
 "the whole time the SUV was next to my car, to stop every 10-15 seconds to bully Was trying 
 
 main puri dehshat main, hamale kii chapet main thi kyonki ve log mujhe baar-baar gherne kii koshish karte or main kisi na kisi tarah apana rasta banaakar nikal jaati or aage badhati rahi
 My hands were trembling, my back was gnawing with fear, i was crying half, half-hearted, because i didn't know if i would even reach home
 ''ab varnika kii 'bahaduree' kii khulkar tarif ho rahi he
 But Varnika says that the reality is that i was 'panicky' right up to that hour until i reached home and saw my father
 lekin chaaron taraf dar se ghire hone ke baavjood unhone thik vahi kiya jisaki aise halaat ke bare main ghar par baatcheet hua karti thiah 100 number par phone karo, apane ko sthiti se baahar nikaalo, phir ghar par phone karo
 But the real courage was in what the Kundu family did after this incident
 ve is baat se katai bhaybheet nahin hue ki aaropee haryana or dilli main gaddinshin bhaajapa se jude hai or unhone tay kiya he ki ve maamle ko uski taarkik parinti tak le jaaenge
 Darpesh Kundu says that she came to the safe house, due to the horrific fear of losing Varnika that night, she got a lot of strength from this
 ve puure vishwaas ke saath kehete hai, ''ham is maamle ko tab tak nahin chodenge jab tak unhen (aropiyon ko) unke kiye kii sajaa nahin mil jaati
 "A week later, the absolutely calm and restrained Varnika is also becoming brave so that she can face and deal with the heinous flood of attempts to shame and discredit her on social media
" jaraa is pahalu par gaur kijieh bhaajapa kii ek pramukh rashtriya pravaktaa shina en
 C
 ne do ladakon ke saath varnika kii ek photo (shaayad unke fasebuk pej se lekar) twit kiya or galati se unamem se ek ladke ko vikaas baraala bataa diya
 His hint was that both had a 'history'
 unhone isamen pradhanmantri narendra modi, raashtrapati ramnath kovind or haryana ke mukhyamantri manohar laal khatter ko tag bhi kar diya
 Although Shaina removed her post and claimed that her account was hacked, bjp's Union Minister of State for Heavy Industries Babul Supriyo questioned one of the Chandigarh Police's investigations into the matter by tweeting one after the other
 mantri mahoday ne 8 agast ko ek twit main kaha, ''ek ladkaa ek ladki kaa peechha karata haih vah nashe main he! dardanaak
 But why is he accused of 'kidnapping' her without investigation? "" a day before this, Haryana BJP Vice President Ramvir Bhati was openly trying to put the victim girl in the dock as to why Varnika had been out for so long
 They did not stop here
 haryana bhaajapa ke mukhiya subhash baraala ke samarthakon or parijanon ne ek fasebuk pej 'justise for vikaas baraala' shuru kiya or is par peedit ladki ko badnaam karte hue na chhapane laayak tamaam baaten chaspaan kar deen
 The leader of this attack on social media also has his own cousin of development Kuldeep Barala, who himself is also said to be accused of kidnapping and sexual harassment in the BJP chief's home constituency Tohana
 varnika ne abhi tak kisi bhi kism kii siyasat se parhez kiya he
 She says that the overwhelming support she has received from the common people, is essentially gaining the strength to emphasize the matter
 vaakye ke ek hakrate baad chandigarh kii 500 se zyada auraten sthaneey mahila kaaryakarta emi singh ke fasebuk par kiye gaye aahvaanah 'meri raat meri sadak' ke campan ke tahat swatarusfoort dhang se sadakon par nikal ain
 Similar protests arose in other places, with similar demonstrations in Delhi, Jaipur and Panchkula

 Aarti Dayal had demanded Rs 3 crore from that engineer named Harbhajan Singh
 itani badi rakam kaa len-dein ve shaatir mahilaayein enjio kii aad main karti thim
 According to the first FIR reports the engineer filed, ATS was already aware of this
 doosraa harbhajan singh ke paas itane paise bhi nahin the ki wo aarti dayaal kaa munh band kar pate
 So the engineer lodged a complaint with the police
 uske baad police ne plan banaakar pehle us blackmailer mahila ko indore bulaayaa or phir use dhar dabocha
 The police arrested three more accused women one after the other at the behest of the woman
 mahangi gadiyon or sampatti kii malkin he artijis aarti dayaal ko police ne pakadaa uske paas land rover, marcides or audi jaisi mahangi lagjri gaadiyaan hai

 In these parties, from leaders and ministers to IAS and IPS officers were called
 aise fansaati thim apana shikarain paanch hasinaaon ne apane husn kaa aisa kaala jaadu chalaaya ki netaa, afasar, kaarobaari or ejeeniyar sab ke sab shikaar ban gaye
 But the question is why and how these beauties made them their victims
 darasal, rasukhdaar hastiyon par kol girl banakar in hasinaaon ne pehle dore daale
 They trap her and then reach the hotel room with her
 unki rangeen mijaaji kaa phayda uthaaya
 His porn video was made and then the game of blackmailing started
 video banane ke liye ye shaatir mahilaayein apni lipstick cover yaa phir chashmen or bag main khufia camera lagaakar video banaati thim
 Sex rackets were going on in 12 districts, not only did they collect money from their victims, but by taking advantage of their influence, they used to get contracts and other government work from them
 police ke mutabik ye hasinaayen madhya pradesh ke kareeb 12 jilon main apana sex racket chalaa rahi thim
 And the gang consists of a total of 18 women
 jo ek enjio kii aad main apana dhandha karti rahi hai
 The five women of this gang arrested were to sit together with the big leaders of BJP and Congress

 This information has been obtained from the conversations and messages on the mobile phones received from these women
 yahi vajah he ki police ise sangathit aparaadh maanate hue behad gopneey tareeke se poochtacha kar rahi he or police prashasan ke bade afasaron ko bhi aropiyon se milane kii ijaajat nahin he

 He said that Ashok Chavan had given his resignation a few days ago, saying that he takes full responsibility for the party's defeat in the Lok Sabha elections

 In fact, it is said that Sharif usually does not read anything, apart from the small reports whose lubbies are already told to him
 iske alaava ve kuch padhate hai to vah urdu ke ek ghatiya akhbaar ke vaicharik lekh hote hai,jo unki party pakistan muslim lig (navaj) yaa piemail (en) ke saath majbootee se judaa he
 This is the reason why his short-sightedness in the Panama case is also largely a result of his negligence and the lax plan to sway the media, the actions of the military's displeasure, the love of India and the balance of Arab countries
 , a legal strategy that does not even stand in the fake court of law school and includes evidence like imaginative transaction amounts more than the loot of Ocean 11 
 unke kunbe ko pichley hafte jo jhelana padaa vah ek kism se unka siyaasi katleam hi he
 Despite this, Nawaz Sharif has not changed
 loktantric number1ve duniya ke akele nirvaachit pradhanmantri hai jinhen teenbar gaddi se bedakhal kiya gaya he
 Once a constitutionally elected president in 1993, the second time in 1999 by the military grabbing the throne and then the Supreme Court last week
 is baar shaayad yah sharif kii furti se kaam nahin kar paane kii naakabiliyat hi thi,jisane unhen hameshaa ke liye khatm kar diya he
 This lawsuit could have been better handled politically
 2016ke madhya main jab panama li kii khabaren chhanakar unke paariwarik halkon main aane lagi thim,sharif kai saare kaam kar sakate the
 They could have kept the opposition in talks for a long time, empowered those investigating the accountability to trace the impossibility in the dark, entangled Imran Khan in another long-running protest, even China -pakistan could ask for the help of military in the right deal with the Economic Corridor (the army wanted to be in the commission to maintain the project) and of course deal with India
 isaki bajaae sharif ne galat andaja laga liya
 Sharif encouraged interrogation and investigation rather than stopping and stalling a scandal apparently going to the court
 jab unke bachche ek ke baad ek chat sho main aa rahe the,unhone mulk ke naam gafalton se bharaa ek paigaam diya
 Not only this, after that, on the floor of the Parliament, he gave a speech in the form of apology
 vah bhi tab jab is dauraan unki soochna kii mashin—yani unki beti or pryojit trolon—ne twitor kaa sahaara liya or usee puraane media or siyaasi sahyogiyon ko unheen puraane dharre kii meharbaaniyon or taur-tareekon ke jariye saadhane kii koshish kii
 These included banquets, promenades, commercials and one-sided news about the army and / or mine
 pareshaan karne vaali baat yah ki in sabase beparwaah sharif is bich lagaataar dharre ke ghise-pite kaamon main masaroof rahe—bematlab kii antarrashtriya yatraaen karnaa,feete kaatane main ghanton jaaya karnaa,mudi kii kisi taaja ranking yaa share bazaar ko lekar maheenon tak itaraate rahanaa,bhitari taur par gadhi gai khabaren press ko li karke iesai ko tang karnaa (don ko li khabaron kaa puraa afasana),kashmir par ek puraa dogier jo kabhi sanyukt raashtra main saamne hi nahin aa sakaa,mantrimandal main koi pherbadal nahin,imran ke baagi tewaron par kadi karrwai,yahaan tak ki bharat ke udyogpati sajjan jindal se mulaakaat
 Everything was going on as if nothing had happened and as if Panama was not a fatal threat, but just a kind of cap or canal
 itnaa hi nahin,unki kanoonee bachaav kii ranneeti is kadar betaratib thi or logon kii dharna ko sanbhaalane kii koshishen itani naakaara thim ki april main sabase pehle faisle main bal-bal batch nikalne ke baad isi sanyukt jaanch team (jeity) ke gathan par,jisane unke ghaatak ant kii patakatha likhi he,unke mantri laddu baantkar khushiyaan manaa rahe the
 The lawyers they had used were mumbling like mouthwashed schoolchildren
 baavjood iske ki unamem se kuch peshey ke sabase behtareen vakeelon main se the,magar saaf taur par ve maheenon puraane maamle or jeity ke ghaat lagaakar kiye gaye hamale kii pechidagiyon kii raftaar pakadaaey laayak nahin the
 The most exciting news that his Ministry of Information could publish was a figure and a request
 aankada yah tha ki panama maamle ko prime time news prograamon main2,600ghante kii tavajjo mili thi or guzarish yah thi ki vajeer-e-ajam ke sabase puraane saathi,taqatvar or pratishthan samarthak grih mantri nisaar ali khan ke bare main''afvaahon"ko puri tarah nazarandaaj kar diya janaa chahie
 Nisar resigned a day before the decision disqualified him
 is tarah ve us afat se batch gaye jise bilkul faisle ke din kii subah tak unki baaki team,mulk ke bheetar rachi gai sajeesh nahin,balki ghuma-firaakar sipiisi ke khilaaf kisi ajeebogareeb antarrashtriya sajeesh kaa rang de rahi thi
 Meanwhile, his hometown Lahore suffered a severe suicide attack
 unhen or unke varisht mantriyon ko—or unki jagah aanevaali sambhavit shakhsiyaton ko--jari aghoshit ikaamon (khadi ke deshon ke liye work permit) kii nakalen unhen sharmasaar karte hue namoodaar ho gayi
 And so Sharif left for the sinking island of Maldives
 aise main pakistan ne yah kehete hue syapa kiya ki nero,tumhaara hi naam navaj he
 Next steps The legal precedents in the April 28 judgment are so complex that the situation regarding Sharif's disqualification is still unclear
 kya un par sadik or amin—jo sharif ke dost or maardarshak divangat jiya ul haq ke banaae pakistan ke samvidhan main ek acha musalmaan hone or sansad kii sadsyta ke liye jaruri shart he—na hone kaa aarope lagaaya ja rahaa he
 His party says that he will return again, the fate of pending cases against him, his political heir daughter, his sons, his sons-in-law and deputy and brother-in-law, finance minister Isaac Dar, is still unclear
 kanoonee taur par unka khaatmaa ho chukaa he
 The Supreme Court is not a lower court
 usne saidhantik rup se sharif kii naitik sthiti par apana faisla suna diya he,jo aay ko ghoshit na karne ke sanvaidhanik aadhaar par aadhaarit he
 The dramatic spate of criminal prosecutions in the case of fake mills — open hearings, overcrowded courts, arrest warrants, and secret volume ten details of the JIT report detailing alleged alleged financial malfeasance of Sharif — is on the way
 The rest is going on and the same Supreme Court panel is going to hear him, who has disqualified him
 upar se anya dastavej bhi li ho rahe hai jo rahasyamay tareeke se media main aa rahe hai
 In this way, the next phase of the cases is not going to give relief from anywhere
 ab udasin dikhne kii baari sena kii he
 The last political statement from the Army Headquarters came several weeks ago on the day the JIT report was released
 tab sena ne kaha tha ki vah pakistan ke rashtriya hit main sakaaratmak bhoomika nibhaane ke liye rashtriya prayaason kaa sahyog karti rahegi
 Within a few days a new campaign was launched to suppress the rebels in Khyber and General Bajwa assured that they would make CPEC a success, whatever the outcome
 baluchistan ko rashtriya suraksha kii sabase badi praathamikta bataaya gaya,frontier kor par hamalon ko naakaam kiya gaya,bhartiya dijiemo ko chetavanee di gai,sangharsh viraam ke ulalanghanon kaa''jawaab"diya gaya
 Even the army chief visited a tank factory
 gahamagahami se bhari july main aisa lag rahaa tha jaise pakistan kii sena kaa dhyaan panama ke dastavejon par ho rahe hangaame se dur kahin or rahaa ho
 The day that disqualified Nawaz Sharif claimed to have evacuated 110 sq km of unstable Rajgal valley on the border of Pakistan and Afghanistan
 jis din sharif pradhanmantri awaas ko chhodkar apane pasandida hill stesan murri ke liye nikle,us din sena pramukh ne apana blue patrol dinar dress pahana or chini duutavas ke kaarykram main piples libration army ke saath ladgaye or marane kii pratigya kii
 After about a month's work, the story of the General's headquarters became clear: the Pakistani army has nothing to do with the Panama uproar
 par suraksha kii diwaar jaruri nahin he ki asthaayee ho,khaskar sharif agar galat tarah se ladaai karne kaa faisla karte hai
 Of course, given the history of this institution with the former Prime Minister, separate statements of current and retired officers express relief, rather happiness, about Sharif's troubles
 yahi nahin,rahasyamayi tareeke se behad sakriy soshal media par bhi meme,bhavishyavaaniyon,shaayari, mujic video or yahaan tak ki raashtrapati pranali ke haq main samvidhan sanshodhan kii sambhaavna (jiskaa phayda beshak imran ko hoga) or zyada chote praanton ke nakshon tak kii bahaar ai hui he
 All these are celebrating the fall of the Sharif family and their Takht Lahore
 itnaa hi saaf yah bhi he ki piemail-en kaa koi bhi padaadhikari yaa bhagidaar aaj tak bharosemand saboot pesh nahin kar sakaa he jo fouj ko is saare paagalpan se pratyaksh yaa paroksh rup se jodta ho
 But once the JIT report is well read, it is clear that all the investigation and investigation done in this investigation done with the approval of the court has been done with a zealous morality: thinker, lawyer, soldier, detective 
 captain,vafaadaar,bhai or kingmekarpakistan ke tazatreen hero kaa apana bhavishya bhi zyada se zyada dhundhalake se ghira he
 In broad daylight, Imran Khan is the political murderer of the emperor and, no matter how, the captain alone led the Panama attack against the Sharif family on his own for 16 months and was never more powerful than today
 magar andhere main unke narpishaach uth khadey hote hai
 An hour after swearing in the interim prime minister, youth Ayesha Gulalai, an important member of his party tehreek-e-insaf (PTI), broke away
 unhone daawa kiya tha ki imran ne unka yon utpeeda kiya tha
 The next morning references of disqualification were filed against Imran
 pichley maheene pitii se ek or dalbadal hua tha
 Simultaneously, Imran's own Sadiq and Amin hearings began (on Sharif's petition, which was targeted over his financial disclosures related to London and Islamabad properties)
 philhal madhyavargeey pratishthan unhen upree tabake ke hero or sharif parivaar kii mughal maansikta kii kaat ke taur hathohath le rahaa he
 If Imran also visits, the doors of the dam will open
 dhire-dhire samajhadaar ho rahe bilaval or takreeban nadaarad asif ke saath jardaariyon ko bhi adaalaton kaa saamana karnaa padegaa
 There is so much open information against many important leaders of Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) that rivers of political blood can flow in Sindh
 is lihaaj se bilaval kaa yah kubulanamaa dil ko chhu lene vaala he ki sharif ke faisle ke din unhone mithai nahin khai
 The PPP doesn't even have any reason to celebrate, but there is a plan: is it being projected as the party with the third highest number of votes in the next election or can play the role of kingmaker? PML in the current plan -N and Imran's beaten-up will fight the most to occupy Punjab
 pipipi ko donon hi partiyon ko bas itnaa kamjor karnaa or sahaara dena padegaa ki ve khud pipipi kaa nahin balki ek duusare kaa safaya karen
 And yes, Zardari will continue his game with the army due to his cunning and notoriety
 badlaav abhi tak to aasaan rahaa he
 Many believe that the interim Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi is a good man
 lekin munhfat or hisaab-kitaab main maahir purv tel or gas mantri—jo khud ek urja saude main javabdehi jaanch se kahin zyada badi jaanch se ghire hai—zyada se zyada khemon main bantati siyasat main sharif ke vafaadaar hai
 The more he will explain the importance of Nawaz, as he did in his August 1 speech, the more it will become difficult for him to govern
 vafaadaaron ko jode rakhane or palabdal ko rokane kii garaj se parivaar ko apni vaaris kii yojana ko faisle ke mahaj kuch hi ghanton baad chori-chhipe jaahir karne ko majaboor hona padaa
 After a 45-day interim period, the younger Sharif - ie the master who is an expert chief minister, an insider, and the keeper of the fort of Punjab - will take over from Abbasi
 tarakkeepsand log ise bhai-bhatijawad bataakar cheekh-pukaar machayenge,par koun parvaah karata he?satta bas parivaar main hi rahani chahie
 This plan makes sense at first sight
 shahabaaz ke fouj ke saath zyada lacheele rishte hai
 He is more agile and zealous than his brother and may take care of the power of the center with remote control until next year's general election
 unke paas baharhaal ek saal se bhi kam vakt he
 But the legal trap has already been laid
 do maamle ab bhi ansulajhe hai
 One of these is the case of the deadly Hudaybya paper mill and the other is the case of the killings in the less important Model Town — which is the only case in which even a small Sharif can be affected
 agar party bhatakati he or achche tareeke se pesh nahin aati he,to shahabaaz or unke mahatvakankshi bete hamaja ke bhi par katare ja sakate hai
 In this way the entire Stark family may have to go
 magar vah episod abhi manchit hona he
 The days of the Sharif family's chill are coming
 shaayad ve aa bhi chuke hai
 On Friday, an MP in the Lok Sabha suggested that an institute for leaders should be opened on the lines of iims, like training centers for IAS, IPS and IFS officers, to produce good leaders
 sadan main shoonyakaal ke dauraan bhaajapa ke da
 Rajan Sushant said that today there is a shortage of qualified leaders
 dalon ke paas achche ummidavaaron ke saath achche netaaon kaa bhi abhaav he
 He said that to overcome this shortage, just as there are institutes for training of IAS, IPS and IFS officers, similarly high level training centers should be opened for making leaders
 sadan main upasthit sadasyon kii hansi or muskuraahat ke bich unhone kaha ki im kii tarj par netaaon ke prashikshan kendra khole jaaen jinka ek vishisht paathyakram bhi banaaya janaa chahie
 Book: Life Writer: Sanjay Sinha Price: Rs 195 Prakash Prakash: Prabhat Publication 'ab hai tum se jindgi apni' This is not the line of a poem but the essence of Sanjay Sinha's life, the motive
 har roj sanjay fasebuk par apni jindagi ke anubhavon se judi kahaniyaan likhte hai
 Sanjay Sinha has shared the same experiences in the book 'jindgi'
 maine jindagi kitaab ko prarambh se ant tak kai baar padhaa
 Got lost while studying in many places
 bahut si baaten mujhe apane bhoge hue yatharth se rubaru kara gayi
 Book life is amazing
 iskaa vimochan jab bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne kiya to patna main vimochan ke gavaah lagbhag das hajaar log the
 i also had the opportunity to review Sanjay's 'rishtey' book and now i am reviewing the 'life' connecting relationships, i find that Sanjay believes that man is driven by emotions and not by reasons, So the machines run
 sanjay kii bhavukta, rishton ke prati atmiyata or samarpan kaa jeeta-jaagta udhaaharan thi pustak ‘rishte’ jisane har kisi kaa dil jeeta or briki kaa kirtiman sthapit kiya
 In three months, the three editions were published by the publisher as there was a demand for readers
 ‘jindagi’ kitaab ‘rishte’ kii agali kadi he jisamen lekhak ke apane anubhav hai, apni kahaniyaan hai
 It is worth mentioning that today, when buyers are decreasing in the Hindi market, then writing a book is a living proof that even today good content (subject matter) makes its own place
 sanjay simha kii lekhnee main maa or bhai ko rishton main sabase zyada ahmiyat di he
 Sanjay started the book 'jindgi' from the mother and ended on the importance of the mother itself
 sanjay ne pustak main swayan spasht kiya he ki jis pehali mahila ne mujhe apni ore aakarshith kiya tha vah meri maa hi thi
 i never wanted to let my mother get away from me, so at the age of four five years i told my mother that i want to marry you
 maa hans padi thim, kehane lageen main tumhaare liye parilok se rajkumaari laauungi
 i was saying that mother cannot be beautiful to you
 aage bhi sanjay ne spasht kiya he ki mrityu se ek raat pehle maa ne mujhe bataaya tha ki vah kal chali jaaegi
 i asked my mother how you will leave, then how will i be alone
 maa ne kaha tha, main tumhaare aas-paas rahuungi
 every moment
 'jindagi' kitaab menma ko sarvopari rakhaa he sanjay ne
 This part of his book, Life, is very poignant, 'says Ramakrishna Paramahamsa was seen as a mother in his wife
 ek aurat main maa kaa dikhnaa hi chetana kaa sabase bada sagar hota he
 Every woman in the world has the right to be proud that she can become a mother
 uske paas apane bheetar se ek manushya ko janm dene kaa madda he
 He often does not need any man for this work
 'sanjay ne apni kitaab jindagi main kai tarah ke nae prayog kiye hai
 As the date is given in place of the chapter
 yah apane aap main ek nayab prayog he
 Whenever you are confused or your heart is depressed, i claim that by reading any two-page story, you will definitely feel relaxed
 'jindagi' main sanjay ne spasht ullekh kiya he ki maa ne hi to fasebuk par logon se milane kii salaah di thi
 As a result of this, Sanjay got a full caravan of many mothers, brothers, sisters, friends and relations and started posting regularly on Facebook
 taarikh 21 november se 'jindagi' kitaab kii shuruuaat he
 Writers give big messages through small events
 pehle bharosa karke aajamaane vaale vyaktiyon ke vishay main sanjay kehete hai ki vah praayah tanha rah jate hai kyonki vah bhaawanaaon se sanchalit hote hai
 Writing on Facebook is part of Sanjay's routine
 fasebuk par hi to anjaan se anjaan rishton ke taar zankrut hote hai
 No matter how much a man does, one day everything will be missed
 rah jaaenge to bas rishte
 When the closeness of the body turns into the closeness of mind, then only the relationship is true and full of love
 apane or paraye kaa bhed bhi sanjay ne lobhi or sone ke udhaaharan se ubhaar diya he
 'love to your loved ones
 sharir kii takalif aadmi sah jaataa he par man kii chot se aadmi bilabila jaataa he'
 In the book of life, we have opened all the gawks of our mind
 hamaari jindagi bahut hi aasaan si hoti yadi ham man kaa cancer khud hi bokar jindagi ko shraap na bana den
 Remember, life is not just our property, but it is the right of many and no one has the right to take away that right
 ham jindagi se pyaar karen or use baandhne kaa prayaas na karen
 Love is surrender, not bondage
 samarpan se hi khushi milti he
 Sanjay is also grateful to his mother here
 maa ne kaha tha, khush rahoge to baaki chijen khud ba khud milane lagengi
 Sanjay saw his favorite moment near him
 ghar ke paudhon ke sookhne par patni kaa kathan 'jis aadmi kii ruh main buraai samahit ho jaati he, usase chhutkaaraa bahut mushkil hota he
 'sanjay remembers mother, who used to say that just the basic nature of man never changes
 fasebuk par postakarte-karte sanjay ke apano kii fehrist bhi lambii hui he or jindagi ke anubhav bhi
 Relationships are very important in life, so share love
 jindagi sandesh detii he ki rishton main khud ko niyantran main rakhiye tabhi bharosa penpega
 Even if you have to complete many things in life, never praise people who do not deserve it, otherwise one day they will drown you with them
 maa kaa saath sanjay ne kahin nahin choda
 In the meeting with Amitabh Bachchan, when Amitabh asked Sanjay to be happy with a glass of water with his hands on his back, a similar incident happened with his mother reminded Sanjay that the work done with good spirit brings blessings
 fasebuk se jude ek bujurg kaa dard bhi jindagi main badi sahajata se bayaan kiya gaya he ki agar aap apane mata-pita kaa sammaan karenge tabhi aap sammaan paane ke hakdaar hai
 Relationships are feelings of mind, try to live them
 bado kaa sammaan kiijie
 When you always feel that someone is with you then self-confidence increases and this self-confidence gives success
 tutaa hua rishta kabhi judata nahin to phir rishte ko sahejie pyaar se, dulaar se, use todie mat
 The last date in the book 'jindgi' is 31 March
 sanjay ke hi shabdon main 'shaadi ke baad jo bhi meri patni se mila, sabane kaha yah tumhaari maa kaa punarjanm he or aaj usee kaa janm din he
 Life is the name of a deep sea of contradictions and fantasies
 yah meri samaj se pare he ki is kitaab ko kis shrenee main rakhaa jaae– ise rahasyamay kahen, romaanch kahen yaa kuch or lekin itnaa jarur he ki sanjay sinha ne sirf shabdon ke saath apane prayog ko anjaam nahin diya balki puri lekhan style hi apane aap main ek prayog he
 Sanjay's book life, which touches the mind, is unique in itself

 After the huge success of 'super 30', which was created to help the poor students appearing in the JEE exam for admission to iits, its founder Anand Kumar is now going to expand it from this year
 isamen aise chaatro ko shaamil karne ja rahe hai, jinhone dasvin kii pariksha paas kii he
 The 'super 30' still used to take 12th pass students
 'super 30' ke liye alp evam dirghakaalik yojanaon ke bare main bataate hue kumaar ne bataaya, '12veen paas chaatro ko padhaane ke maujuuda kaarykram ke alaava humlog do saal ke is nae kaarykram main kareeb 10-20 chaatro ko padhaane kii yojana bana rahe hai
 We will start this program from this year and from next year it will be done on a wider scale
 ' nae kaarykram main kitne chaatro ko shaamil kiya jayega, is bare main puche jane par unhone bataaya ki antim rup diya ja rahaa he, lekin isamen '10, 15 yaa 20' chaatro ko shaamil kiya ja saktaa he
 The comments pratishthit bhartiya praudyogiki sansthaanon (iaiti) main daakhile ke liye yojit sanyukt pravesh pariksha (jeii) main is saal 30 chaatro main se 28 ne safalataa hasil kii, jo 15 saal pehle isaki sthapana ke baad isaki nai uplabdhi he
 Kumar said that his biggest aspiration is to establish a school for poor children based on a self-sufficient model
 unhone bataaya ki 'super 30' kii website par downlod kiye ja sakane yogya lacture ek rupee main uplabdh karaane kii bhi yojana he
 (apart from the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it has been published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) Explaining the short and long term plans for 'super 30', Kumar said, 'apart from the current program of teaching 12th pass students, we are planning to teach about 10-20 students in this new program of two years
 
 humlog is saal se is kaarykram kii shuruyaat karenge or agle saal se ise or vyapak falak par kiya jayega
 When asked about how many students will be included in the new program, he said that the finalization is being done, but '10, 15 or 20' students can be included in it
 tippaniyan This year 28 out of 30 students succeeded in the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) conducted for admission to prestigious Indian Institutes of Technology (iits), a new achievement since its inception 15 years ago

 He said that if there is a premature election, his party is ready
 basapa pramukh mayawati dwaara samay se purv loksabhaa chunaav hone kaa sanket dene ke sambandh main puche gaye sawaal par pavaar ne kaha, ‘samprag sarkaar sthir he or iske astitv ko lekar koi samasya nahin he kyonki kai anya partiyaan iskaa samarthan kar rahi hai

 unhone kaha, ‘desh ko bijli or udyog kii aavashyaktaa he
 But at the same time farmers should get adequate compensation and they should be rehabilitated
 in sabhi muddon kaa vidheyak main niraakaran kiya gaya he
 ' sports yearphone wo category he jisamen ab dhire-dhire deveopment dekhne ko mil rahaa he
 Wireless Bluetooth earphones hold their own after wired earphones
 ab milte-julate fitures ke saath bharat main kai companiyaan sports category main apane audio products utaar rahi hai
 However, the number of these companies is still small
 JBL ne haal hi main apane Endurance range main nae wireles audio products Dive, Jump, Sprint or Run ko launch kiya tha
 Their price respectively
 6,999 rupee, 4,799 rupee, 3,999 rupee or 1,599 rupee rakhi gai he
 We have used Endurance Jump for a long time and now we are passing it on to you
 bild,dizinend tach controls:is wireles yearphone kaa dizin kisi aam yearphone kii tulana main kaaphi alag he
 First of all, it has been made very simple looking, in which all the functions are present
 isaki body plastic or soft rabar kii bani hui he
 The rubber base is designed to keep it from slipping while running
 jaisaa ki hamane kaha ki iskaa dizin amairfonaki tulana main alag he
 In such a situation, you will not see any kind of control button here
 isamen JBL ketrademarkwali powerhook technology di gai he
 That is, the earplug on the right side turns on the entire device as soon as it is separated and turns off as soon as it is attached
 ye kuch vaisaa hi he jaise Jabra yaa oneplus ne apane haalia yearfones main yuj kiya he
 Where there are many function controls through magnets
 khaas baat ye he ki isamen tach controls die gaye hai
 Which make it different
 in tach controls ke bare main ham neeche vistaar se charchaa karenge
 If you talk about comfort, then first of all, it has to be understood that it is a sports earphone that is designed for use during running and exercise
 to ise dekhte hi pahananaa aasaan nahin he
 In such a situation, you will have to give it some time for proper fitting in the beginning
 aapako bataa den isaki vir choti he, aise main jinke baalo kii wolum kam he unke liye isaki fitting aasaan he
 But for those whose hair volume is high, especially women, it may be difficult for them
 lekin yahaan baat agar fitting kii karen to zyada lambii vir se daudane bhaagane ke vakt pareshaani ho sakati he
 Perhaps the company may have kept the wire short to avoid this
 lekin dhyaan rahe ye vir itani bhi choti nahin he ise aasaani se pahana ja saktaa he
 Likewise, when talking about its fitting on the ears, this device has been designed in such a way that you will feel comfortable and even after using it for a long time, you will not feel any pain around the ears
 khaastaur par yeartips ke neeche kaa dizin acchhee fitting ke liye banaaya gaya he
 Its design can make you look big in just a little ears
 lekin wo bhi kaan ke strecchar par nirbhar karata he
 Overall, it is certain that its fitting is so excellent that no matter how much you run, it will not move you through your ears
 ek baat or yahaan dhyaan dene vaali he ki ye yearphone aapke kaanon ko puri tarah dhank dete hai
 In such a situation, the outside voice also stops coming to a great extent
 isliye kisi anhoni se bachane ke liye iskaa upyog bheed-bhaad vaali jagahon main karne se bachein
 Now speaking of the coolest feature of this device, touch control has been given in it
 aisa aamtaur par kisi yearphone main dekhne ko nahin miltaa
 We can call it a futuristic design in an earphone
 yahaan rhite said ke yearbad main tach control die gaye hai
 Light indicator is also given here
 isi par ek baar tach karne se gaanaa play / poj hota he, do baar karne se trek next hota he teen baar karne se trek reverse hota he
 Similarly, one touch is also enough to receive or cut the call
 hairaani aapako isamen wolum ko ap-down karne ke vakt hogi
 Because for this you have to soft slide up and down in the ride earbud itself to up-down the volume
 lekin jitna ye feechar kool he utana hi aapako isaki aadat lagane ke liye training kii jarurat hogi
 If you are listening to a song and suddenly start fitting it, there will be many times that the track will be changed
 yaa galati se tach ho jane kii vajah se gaanaa poj ho jayega
 And most of all you have to pay attention while doing less and more volume
 kyonki ye itnaa aasaan nahin he aapako isaki aadat daalani hogi
 If you are using it regularly at home, then you are lying in bed, then due to the sensitive touch, your track may be paused
 aise hi agar aap kol main hai to ho saktaa he ki is divaais kaa yuj nahin karnaa chaah rahe hon lekin ise nikaalte hi aapako phone cat jayega kyonki powerhook technology kii vajah se yearphone alag hote hi band ho jayega
 Calling quality: Since it has been built for sports activity more than earphones and still has an in-built microphone for calling
 aise main behtareen audio quality kii ummid bekaar hi he
 But still it is okay to talk
 chunki mike ise pahanane ke dauraan peeche kii tarah ho jate hai isliye bheed-bhaad vaale ilaake main saamne vaale ko aapaki aawaaj clear nahin aati he
 You will get good and loud voice quality in a quiet place
 saath hi ek baat or dhyaan rakhen ki chunki aapkaa kaan puri tarah se dhanka hua hota he to aap baat karte hue baahar kii aawaaj se talmail nahin bitha pate
 So altogether we can consider calling quality as average
 bydaree:ek baar puri tarah se charge hone ke baad is divaais kii bydaree kareeb-kareeb 7:30 ghante tak chal jaati he
 We can consider it right for an audio product
 bahut acha to nahin hi kah sakate
 The best part is that it has a fast charge feature so that it can be run for about half an hour in 10 minutes of charging
 audio quality:is yearphone ko ham do tarah se samajhane kii koshish karte hai pehla to ye ki ise sports activity ke liye banaaya gaya he
 In such a situation, more attention is paid to design in these earphones
 or doosraa ye ki wireles yearfones main aamtaur par bahut behtareen audio quality nahin milti he
 But it also takes care of design as well as audio quality
 kahin-kahin par thodi bahut crisp or diteling miss jarur hoti he, lekin sports activity ke dauraan aap ise bhul sakate hai
 What you miss the most in terms of audio quality is the perfect soft base and surround
 baaki sabhi chijen keemat ke andar sahi thaharti he
 Verdict: Now the question is, should you buy it? So the answer is that if you want a great fitting earphone for sports activity, then you can invest money in it
 saath hi isamen aapako kool tach feechar bhi milegaa
 Remember, its touch feature can also bother you
 baharhaal, isamen kuch kamiyaan kol quality or sound quality ko lekar jarur he lekin ye ek behtareen overol package he

 This is one of the most effective of the schemes launched by the Prime Minister for the poor, which is returning trust and hope on the face of the poor, on the other hand, to the BJP on the other hand Votes are also getting well from this scheme
 maine vyaktigat rup se swayan kai labhaarthiyon se baat kii, unase mili jawaab ke aadhaar par hi yah likh rahaa hoon
 In the words of the authors of the book, it is better than the Out Of Pocket System, in which most services are bought by paying cash, but then what is the problem? Why is this story remembered today? In fact, a few days ago, a judge of Allahabad High Court while hearing a case related to farmers praised the scheme and said that this scheme is going to fulfill the dreams of Mahatma Gandhi and Dr
 Ambedkar
 sapanom se yaad aayaa he ki sapane to bade doordarshee hote hai
 They are not seen only today, but for a longer time
 ayushmaan bharat yaa PM-JAY ko obama kear kii tarz par kuch logon dwaara modi care bhi kaha jaataa he
 Most of those who say so are BJP / Modi supporters
 swayan pradhanmantri narendra modi bhi ise duniya kii sabase badi swasthya beemaa yojana bataakar vot maangane main koi kasar nahin chhodte
 The same can be said about the health insurance scheme passed by then US President Barack Obama in 2010, but unlike Modi, his supporters were also in India
 ye vahi log the jo samaajwaad main gahari aasthaa rakhte hai or maanate the ki poonjivadi america main aisi 'kalyankari yojanaayen' honi chahie
 After the discussion of Obama Care, similar medical insurance scheme was started in India
 sugabugahat karne vaale vahi samaajawaadee log the
 However, in 2008, the UPA came out with the National Health Insurance Scheme, which provided medical benefits of Rs 30,000 / - to the BPL family
 chunki uskaa kshetra bahut vyapak nahin tha lekin phir bhi yojana to thi hi
 Looking at the timing of this book published in August 2013, it seems that when the authors would have written the book, they have given a detailed discussion on health in India, influenced by Obama care
 haalanki aisa nahin he ki lekhakon ke nishkarsh hameshaa sahi hon
 For example, the authors wrote about health policy in one place that "health policy is in a somewhat confused state today
" ek ore saarvajanik swasthya sevaaon ko majboot karne ke liye sakaaratmak kadam (rashtriya gramin swasthya mishan se lekar janata ko jenrik davaayen uplabdh karaane tak) uthaae ja rahe hai to duusari ore nijee swasthya beemaa par nirbharta badhaane kii disha main teji se pragati ho rahi he (jise swasthya udyog sakriyata se protsaahan de rahaa he)
 Not only this, there is no specific clarity about the principles on which India's healthcare system will be based in the future
 "now if we look at this in the present scenario, then the government has made remarkable efforts for the availability of generic medicines, On the other hand, which can be considered a remarkable step towards making treatment cheaper for the poor, on the other hand, the claims of giving free treatment to the poor through insurance Minister, why does not explicitly do? What can not go public and private, both with? Well
 
 
 lekin hamen apane aapako jaj sahab kii tippanee ke sandarbh main PM-JAY tak simit rakhana he
 As mentioned above, this scheme is becoming very popular among the poor, they are also getting the treatment of need, but looking at the long term clause, this scheme does not appear to solve the basic problem
 jaise roti-kapadaa-makaan ke baad (yaa kahen saath-saath) chikitsa / swasthya kaa number aata he
 People turn to hospitals around them for minor illnesses, where governments should try to arrange public hospitals
 lekin nijee beemaa or nijee kshetra ko mili protsaahan ke baad aisa hota nahin he
 Because now the insured will try to treat daily diseases like cold and fever for free, so he will unnecessarily turn to private hospital and private hospital is sitting for this reason
 jis beemaari kaa ilaaj 50 rupee main ho saktaa he, beemaa ke kaaran nijee aspataal uske badale 500 basoolenge
 There is no denying that robbery takes place in private hospitals, then when the patient goes to treatment without worrying about the cost, how much unnecessary loot will happen, it can be easily imagined
 or jab har koi nijee chikitsa kaa laabh lenaa chahega to sarkaar bhala kyon saarvajanik swasthya / chikitsa par kharch karegi? or agar kar bhi diya to koi kyon un aspataalon kaa rukh karegaa? ab jab nijee aspataalon main maang badhegi to ve bazaar ke niyamanusaar apni suvidha shulk bhi badhayenge
 That is, the treatment that is done in 3-4 lakhs now, may be started in 5-6 lakhs
 
 
 ? aisa hi hoga, kyonki yah niyam he
 Now expensive medical services will be hit on the class, which is outside PM-JAY, now takes health insurance at its own expense or gets treatment at its own expense
 lekhakon ne bataaya he ki baat chaahe america kii ho, britain kii ho, japan ho, china, dakshin korea se lekar costa rika kii
 
 
 Wherever the change in healthcare has been successfully implemented in the history of the world, the basis of this has been the strengthening of public healthcare, but in the context of India it does not appear so
 swasthya beemaa jaise kadam ek chalaang lagane kii koshish karte hai or sidhe nijee kshetra se apeksha rakhte hai
 This arrangement is related to hospital service
 ab aise main sambhaavna yahi he ki vyavsaayik swasthya vyavastha beemaari kii rokthaam or aspataal mukt upachaar ke khilaaf hi hogi
 This is unlike insurance based health services
 udhaaharan ke taur par bharat main zyaadaatar bimaariyaan sankramak rogon ke kaaran hoti hai
 Many non-communicable diseases such as diabetes, blood pressure problems and cancer can be better treated before hospitalization
 ames mangalagiri ke adhyaksh dow ties ravikumar or pondicherry inttitute of medical science main professor dow jorge abraham da-hindu main likhe ek lekh main bataate hai ki kaise rokthaam kii kami ke kaaran 70 fisadi cancer marijon kaa ilaaj teesri yaa chauthi stage par ho paata he
 Due to this, the death rate is high, the rate of treatment is very low and if seen in terms of meaning, even then the cost of treatment will increase by three to four times compared to the first stage
 itnaa hi nahin, swasthya beemaa yojanaayen sampurna cancer kii beemaari ko cover nahin karti, parinaam swaroop ek to out of pocket kharch badhata he yaa phir marij ilaaj bich main hi chhod detaa he
 Think of it in some way that public health services try to keep the people healthy by making changes in their daily routine, which is why people insist on making them aware
 jaagrukta ke in sandeshon ko aap unke parche par, gaanv-shahar kii deevaaron par yaa unase judi chizon par dekh-pard sakate hai
 And if you still fall ill, go to them
 lekin beemaa aadhaarit nijee swasthya udyog main aisa nahin he
 They are just waiting for you to become ill
 matlab yah model karkon par bal na dekar sidhe parinaamon ke upachaar par jor detaa he
 If you do not fall ill, how will the business go? The fact is that the expenditure on health in India is very low compared to GDP
 philhal yah 1

 5 fisadi tak he
 Government it 2
 5 fisadi karnaa chaahati he
 This year, the government has increased the allocation by Rs 7000 crore as compared to the previous
 2
 It should be increased from around Rs 60-65,000 crore according to 5 per cent, but what we have to note here is that 6400 crores have been kept in the budget for PMJAY this year
 yani badha hua bajet lagbhag puraa kaa puraa isi beemaa yojana main ja rahaa he
 That is, the government also wants to pursue medical services through this route? It is not that authors are totally opposed to private medical services
 ve kerala kaa udhaaharan dete hai, jahaan nijee kshetra ko us samay maidan diya gaya jab saarvajanik swasthya ne puri taaqat se apni jaden jamaa leen
 That is, the private played the role of a partner in the public sector

 In comparison, the authors recommend learning from the Canadian model, where the perceived socialist health model has shown far more impact than the US, at a lower cost than the US

 Airtel or Jio may be flourishing in place of BSNL, Reliance can remove gas in KG basin instead of ONGC, JP Infrastructure can replace Yamuna Expressway in place of NHAI, but health will come to the basic needs, the government should take the responsibility Will fall

 In a three-hour-long interrogation, Shivshankar presented a bundle of papers to prove his claim that in 2006, the then Telecom Minister Dayanidhi Maran turned down his license applications
 unke mutabik, in dastavejon se sabit ho jayega ki maaran ne airsel main, jise unhone shuru kiya tha, unki 74 fisadi hissedari ko singapore sthit mexis ko bechney ke liye majaboor kar diya
 Maxis owner T

 CBI is investigating the financial transactions between Sun TV and Maxis as well as the takeover of Aircel
 philhal kendriya kapadaa mantri maaran ne doorsanchaar mantri ke rup main apane kaarykaal ke dauraan dishnet wireles (nayaa naam airsel) ko kathith taur par 14 license die
 The events were as follows: * Sivasankaran started Aircel in 1998 - owned two circles in Chennai and Tamil Nadu under Dishnet
 baad main inhen ek sarkal main mila diya gaya
 * Arun Shourie granted seven additional licenses of 'C' category to Dishnet on 21 April 2004
 dishnet 2005 main airsel cellular ban gai
 * On 31 December 2005, Shivshankar sold Aircel to Maxis and eight of its circles to the Maxis and Pratap Reddy families for $ 800 million
 shivashankaran ne sibiai ko bataaya ki maaran ne unhen bechney ke liye majaboor kiya
 Maxis applied for more lucrative circles during January 12 and March 3, 2006, and Maran immediately gave her away
 *malaysian arbapati krishnan ne san diarect main 20 fisadi hissedari hasil karne ke liye 16
 Invested $ 6 million
 shivashankaran kaa daawa he ki yah airsel par maaran kaa ehsaan chukaane ke liye kiya gaya
 Maran now has to not only respond to the CBI but also react to the report made by his government
 us report main un par kai tarah ke galat kaam karne or airsel ko qatari main aage badhaane main madad karne kaa aarope he
 Since Telecom Minister Kapil Sibal has sent the report of a member committee of Justice Shivraj Patil to the CBI, it is clear that Maran's own government has blamed him
 maaran kii sabase badi musiibat yah he ki unke bachaav ke har bindu ko samiti ne khaarij kar diya he
 The committee's report states that Maran deliberately put Dishnet's application on hold, asked nonsensical questions and removed all obstructions after Maxis arrived
 disambar 2006 main maatr nau dinon ke bheetar 14 uniphoid acces sarvice license (yuaesel) ke aavednon-jinamein se kuch teen saal se lambit the-ko manjuuri de di gai
 Consider this defense of Maran: "I took complete impartiality in the decision-making
" maine kisi company kaa paksh nahin liya
 Nor was there any loss of revenue
 yahaan tak ki sieji ne bhi mere kaarykaal main kisi tarah kii rajasav haani kaa koi zikr kiya he
 "but the committee's report blamed Maran for favoring Dishnet Wireless

 Maxis announced in the Malaysian stock market SE Bursa Malaysia that its 99 in Aircel
 3 fisadi aarthik hit he jabaki us company main uski hissedari 74 fisadi hi thi
 CBI sources told India Today that Sivasankaran gave records of several phone calls to investigators
 ye phone unhen un adhikariyon ne kiye the jo maaran bandhuon ke liye kaam kar rahe the
 He gave the details of the arbitration between him and Maxis, which was related to the grant of $ 300 million for 26 per cent of Aircel to Sivasankaran
 yah hissaa reddy parivaar ko mila tha
 Sivasankaran claims that he sold 100 percent of his company to Aircel but received 74 percent of the money
 ve 2006 main airsel ke share ke bazaar bhav ke aadhaar par itani raashi kaa daawa kar rahe hai
 But CBI officials contended that the arbitration was a civil matter and had nothing to do with the alleged coercion that led Sivasankaran to lose his company
 iskaa jawaab dene ke liye adhigrahan samraat ne kuch samay maanga
 Sivasankaran told CBI, "I am not hiding anything
 main aisa udhyami hum jo apane jamaane se aage tha

 It is very difficult to do business in India without following the decree of the leaders
 '' unhone kaha ki ve maaran bandhuon kii ore se sataae jane ke dar se chennai chhodkar california or antat seychelles chale gaye
 CBI officials also told Sivasankaran that Maxis is not the only company associated with them which they are investigating

 "maran wants this entrepreneur's relationship with Tata to be investigated as Sivasankaran holds an eight per cent stake in Tata Teleservices

 This was opposed by many other parties including Congress, BJP, CPI, NCP, BSP
 in dalon kaa kahana tha ki siaisi apane adhikaar kshetra se baahar aakar nirnay le rahaa he
 Significantly, the coal scam and MNREGA disturbances were detected only through RTI, but despite this, political parties have been opposing to bring themselves under it
 desh ke top 10 raajnneetik dalon ke paas chande ke taur par har baras sava lakh karod se zyada kii raashi aati he

 That is, by allowing even the smallest amount of corruption to come to light, scamsters go to any extent
 tab sawaal he ki jab takat raajnneeti main basati he to raajnneetik dal hi agar khud ko artiai se alag rakhenge to phir eemaandaaree yaa paardarshita kaa bharosa kaise jagega
 It is also difficult to make a favorable policy and make laws by sitting in a position of profit
 lekin yah saamne isliye nahin aa paaegaa kyonki artiai in par lagu nahin hoga

 The bitterness between the Center and the state deepened with the arrest of Delhi's Law Minister
 haalanki centre sarkaar daawa kar rahi he ki uskaa is giraftaari ke peeche koi haath nahin he
 However, this statement of the Union Home Minister on the arrest of Delhi Law Minister Jitendra Tomar is not embracing the people
 aam aadmi party ye maanane ko taiyaar nahin ki dilli police grih mantralay ko bharose main liye bina aisi hai profile giraftaari kar sakati he jiske raajnneetik asar bhi hon
 The party said that this is a revenge action, not happening on others
 'aap' ke netaa kumaar vishwaas kehete hai, 'agar kanoon sabake liye ek he to smriti irani par bhi ye cese chal rahaa he, nihaal chand par bhi, unhen giraftaar kyon nahin kiya gaya
 According to him, the speaker was also not informed about the arrest
 lekin grih mantralay kaa kahana he, 'vidhansabha chal rahi hoti to giraftaari se pehle spikar ko bataanaa padataa, vidhansabha satr nahin chal rahaa isliye giraftaari ke baad 24 ghante ke bheetar spikar ko bataaya ja saktaa he
 The police did not have to obtain permission for this arrest
 tomars police se sahyog nahin kar rahe the, isliye unhen giraftaar kiya gaya
 Comments dilli police bhi daawa kar rahi he ki tomars kii giraftaari kisi raajnneetik dabaav main nahin kii gai he
 Delhi Police Commissioner BS Bassi said, "we registered the case and arrested based on the evidence
 ' However, this action has increased the bitterness between the Center and the Delhi government
 haalanki dilli ke kanoon mantri jitendra tomars kii giraftaari par kendriya grih mantri kaa yah bayaan logon ke gale nahin utar rahaa
 The Aam Aadmi Party is not willing to believe that Delhi Police can arrest such high profile without taking the Home Ministry into confidence which also has political implications
 party ne kaha ki ye badale kii karrwai he, dusron par nahin ho rahi
 AAP leader Kumar Vishwas says, "if the law is one for all, then this case is going on Smriti Irani, even on Nihal Chand, why she was not arrested
" ' unke mutabik spikar ko bhi giraftaar ke bare main jaankaree nahin di gayi
 But the Ministry of Home Affairs says, "had the assembly been going on, the speaker would have to tell before the arrest, the assembly session is not going on, so the speaker can be told within 24 hours after the arrest
 police ko is giraftaari ke liye ijazat lene kii zarurat nahin thi

 According to the rape victim, in the year 2014, Gayatri Prasad Prajapati called her to Gautampalli residence in Lucknow on the pretext of job and plot

 The English newspaper 'the Indian Express' reported this
 sibiai ne chitthee kii copy kaale dhan par gathit special investigeshan team (esaiti) ko bhi bheji he
 Ranjit Sinha wrote the letter to banking secretary GS Sandhu and revenue secretary Shaktikanta Das last week
 unhone daawa kiya ki kai bade corporate santhaan 'third party transfar' main lipt hai or arabiai ke nirdeshon kaa ulanghan kar rahe hai
 Sinha has also claimed that banks are also playing the role of a party in these third party transfers and billing is done through 'tax haven' countries through intermediaries

 Then what happened was that after seeing the poster, the supporters of the BJP became furious and got entangled with the administration and police and demanded that the poster be removed immediately
 mandir par maujuud bijepi ke samarthakon kaa kahana tha ki jis building par rahul or akhilesh ke poster lage the, vah ek masjid he jiskaa naam bivi razia masjid he
 BJP workers alleged that such a large poster of Rahul Gandhi and Akhilesh Yadav on the wall of the mosque was violating the code of conduct
 bhaajapa netaaon kii daleel thi ki chunaav ayog ke nirdesh ke anusaar kisi bhi dharmik sthal par kisi bhi raajnneetik dal ke binar yaa poster nahin lagaae jaaenge
 At first, the people of the administration ignored the plea of the BJP supporters, but as the matter grew furious, the administration hurriedly removed the posters of Rahul Gandhi and Akhilesh Yadav

 Everyone who has studied at the National Law School (NLS) in recent times must have faced a baffling question in their first year - "what is history?" For students, where excellence means more than simply learning their course well, this question has baffled me

 elizabeth ne sabake bich se yah prashn mujhase hi puch liya
 i tried to give mixed answers by adding many facts but failed
 phir yah sochane laga ki kahin eneles main daakhila lekar maine koi galati to nahin kar di he
 But even after fifteen years, i remember it well today because this incident reflects the life of NLS — to question basic beliefs, motivate students to develop original thinking, regardless of the background they come from Let him forget and give him a chance to cultivate a culture of candor in which the views of all are well respected
 enelsi ko mahaan banane kaa shrey, santhaan main sawaal poochne or ek duusare kaa sammaan karne kii samskruti ko jaataa he
 It has the support of the students' association and any person can openly express his views on the board of the college through freedom of expression 19 (1) (a)
 pratham varsh ke chaatr ke rup main main apane seniors ke saath kisi bhi vishay par khulkar asahmati jataa saktaa tha, basharte iske peeche uchit kaaran or sahi tark hon
 The juniors were always ready to guide the juniors
 asal main ek senior, jo ki ab mere ajij mitra or ek bade lau form main saajheedaar hai, ne eneles main mere pravesh ke tisare hi din mere saamne apana dil kholkar rakh diya tha
 He explained the importance of grades (not just moots) in law schools and regretted that he did not take enough seriousness in his first year of college to study
 yahaan kii sabase anuthi baat he—chaahe kisi chaatr ne achche grad hasil kiye hon yaa na hon—yahaan aapako jindagi kii asal shiksha mil jaati he jo jindagi main acha mukaam hasil karne main hameshaa kaam aati he
 This has been possible due to the brilliant professors here who have a great passion for their subject
 eneles main maine jitne bhi course liye, uske bare main meraa vichaar he ki chaahe vah muslim personal lau main viraasat se jude ajeebogareeb niyam hon yaa phir samvidhan ke anuchhed 14 main supreme court dwaara madhyasthata or samanta ke bich kaa ajeeb ghalmail, yahaan kanoon kaa adhyayan raajnneeti or satta kaa adhyayan tha
 Law, as i learned in NLS, is a legitimate instrument of state power often designed to protect the interests of the majority
 yadi kanoon vyavastha or samanta sthapit karne ke liye hote hai, to samay-samay par use anuchit, anyaaypurna or bhedbhaav se bharaa hone kii vajah se chunauti bhi deni hogi
 Here, teaching of the law and raising finger on the same, both of them used to run simultaneously
 yah jaankaar khush hum ki eneles ek baar phir se neshnal ranking main awwal aayaa he
 i also feel the need to have a healthy skepticism of this achievement, as i have already mentioned the principles of the institute earlier and following the same ones that make it to the top
 yah sirf eneles hi nahin balki desh ke liye bhi chintaa kii baat he ki eneles bharat kaa sarvshereshth lau skool hone ke baavjood, duniya ke sarvshereshth lau collejon ke aasapaas bhi kahin nahin fatakta
 Its journals are good but not great
 iske faikalti dwaara hone vaale prakaashan simit hai or chaatr nae ayaamon ko hasil karne kii jagah korporate jagat main oonche vetan vaali naukariyon ke peeche hi bhaagate hai
 The time has come that NLS should now leave it to the highest law school in India, and strive towards making its place among the top five colleges in the world
 eneles se nikalne ke baad university of oxford, jo ki asal main duniya ke sarvshereshth vishvavidhyalayon main se ek he, main paanch saal bitaane ke baad main vishwaas ke saath kah saktaa hum ki eneles is lakshya ko hasil kar saktaa he
 For this, NLS will have to prepare for some basic changes
 pehali baat, sarkaar ko eneles ko rashtriya mahatv kaa santhaan ghoshit karnaa chahie
 The leading law college of the country should have a splurge to increase excellence in research and not get entangled in petty politics like state and regional quota
 duusari baat, ise kaaman lau admician test (sieleti) se baahar aana chahie
 CLAT plays a good role in reducing the number of examinations for students, but it should move towards a concise, carefully crafted and logic-based testing process to attract the best talent in the world
 teesri baat, koi bhi santhaan apane purv chaatro ko faikalti ke rup main waapas college kii ore aakarshith kiye bina utkrushtataa hasil nahin kar sakaa he
 The NLS record is mixed in this direction
 haalanki kai purv chaatr eneles main padhaate rahe hai phir bhi yah sankhya or adhik ho sakati thi
 Every great law school in the world has become great because of its students who later became professors of their own college
 is disha main eneles ko bhi gaur karnaa hoga
 Fourth, high-quality journals need to be continuously published to make it to the best law colleges in the world
 na keval duniyabar se achche faikalties ko aakarshith karne kii jarurat he, balki unhen keval padhaane yaa phir pariksha or project ko jaanchane ke kaam main lagaae rakhane kii jagah unhen likhane-padhane ke bhi paryaapt avasar die jane chahie tabhi achche jarnal or gunvattta vaale lekh prakashit ho sakenge
 The size of the student institution must be corrected and excellent faculty-student ratio is a must
 neshnal lau skool of india rivyuu ke purv sampadak ke rup main, mujhe pataa he ki ucch gunvattta vaali kanoon samikshaayen ke prakashit karne kii hamaare paas jabardast kshamta maujuud he
 The nature of the legal profession in India is such that, with the exception of a few notable exceptions, the impact of the real world is rarely seen in academic publications
 eneles ko is sthiti ko badalane ke prayaason kii aguai kerani hogi
 He not only has to publish high-quality law reviews, but also has to try to establish the results of his research in the real world with the intervention of the courts by filing public interest litigation
 eneles main padhai ke dauraan ham yah sunne ke aadi ho gaye the ki yah skool khud ko 'harvard of da east' maanata tha
 Professor Madhav Menon laid the foundation of NLS with a vision to prepare Social Engineers as lawyers
 yah ek moulik vichaar tha kyonki bharat ko apane vakeelon or kanoonvidon kii jarurat thi na ki america samvidhan ke prati samarpit nakalchiyon kii
 The time has come for us to try to return to the same fundamental idea of professor Menon and try to make it real from the perspective of the 21st century
 yah tabhi sambhav hoga jab hamaara drushtikon, eneles ke hamaare moolmantra-'ware nolej ij free' par aadhaarit or moulik hoga
 Free knowledge will not only succeed in making the National Law College the former Harvard but it will also increase India's pride and emerge as an exemplary model for universities in third world countries
 lekhak neshnal lau skool (eneles) ke purv chaatr or vidhi centre for legal policy ke shodh nideshak hai

 If penetration is to increase among the youth, the BJP will have to change its image
 yahi vajah he ki ab party ke har manch or bade netaaon ke daftaron main swami vivekanand kii tasviir dikh jaati he
 In the BJP session, when Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi also called for the overthrow of the current UPA government, he did not talk about Ram Raj, but gave a shout to make India of Vivekananda's dreams
 modi ne kaha, ''vivekanand ne sava sau saal pehle bharatmata ke jagatguru banane kaa sapana dekha tha, ab ham sankalp karen ki desh jab unki diamond jubilee manayega to unke sapane ko puraa kar denge
 The Sangh Parivar, including the BJP, considers itself the bearer of Swami Vivekananda's legacy
 sangh ke sarkarywah bhaiyyaji joshi india today se kehete hai, ''swami ji ne samarthyashalee bharat banane, yuva shakti ko samvedansheel hokar gaanv, garib, daridr, peedit, upekshit ke liye khadey hone kaa sandesh diya tha

 Golwalkar returned to the Sangh on the instruction of Swami Ramakrishna's disciple Akhandanandji and later handed over the command of the Vivekananda Rock Memorial Committee to Eknath Ranade, the former Sarkaryavah of the Sangh

 The song says that along with the promise of free water, and cheap electricity, the AAP government has also forgotten its promises to provide houses to the poor, provide security to women, install CCTV and provide free wi-fi
 iske alaava kejariwal sarkaar par shiksha kshetra kii tarakkee ke liye kiye gaye vaadon ko bhi bhul jane kaa aarope lagaaya gaya he
 According to the song, the Aam Aadmi Party government, which has 'put on the hat' to the public by calling them all corrupt, is no longer able to see the common man, and is constantly diverting public attention by dharna or by implicating them in aud-even
 haalanki dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne somvaar ko hi apni sarkaar kaa ek saal puraa hone ke maukey par NDTV se baatcheet main daawa kiya tha ki unhone jo bhi vaade chunavi ghoshnaptr main kiye, unamem se kai puure ho gaye hai, or baaki par kaam jari he
 He had said that soon 24 hours electricity will reach every house in Delhi
 arvind kejariwal ne kaha tha ki shiksha or swasthya unki sarkaar kii praathamikta hai, tathaa unhone sarkari skulon ke liye shiksha bajet ko doguna kar diya he or jald hi 1,000 mohalla clinics khole jaaenge

 Angry over the relationship of its intelligence agency ISI with terrorist organizations, Pakistan has lashed out at the US and warned that it is taking the risk of losing one of its partners on such allegations
 pakistani videsh mantri hina rabbaani khaar ne kaha, hamane america ko avgat kara diya he ki aap ek saajhedaar ganvaa denge
 You cannot bear the cost of separating Pakistan, you also cannot bear the cost of isolating the Pakistani people
 agar ve aisa karte hai to apni keemat par aisa karenge
 This stern statement from Hina came at a time when US Supreme Army Admiral Michael Mullen alleged that the ISI was helping the Haqqani network
 hakkaani network ko beete 13 sitambar ko kabul main america duutavas par hue hamale kaa jimmedaar mana ja rahaa he
 Mullen said that a powerful faction of the Taliban has become an important part of the Pakistani intelligence agency
 yah pehali baar he ki kisi sheersh america adhikari ne iesai ke aatanki sanghathanon se rishte kii baat itane sakht lahaze main kii he
 Hina Rabbani, who arrived in New York to attend a UN General Assembly meeting, said in a conversation with Pakistani news channel Geo News that terrorists in Afghanistan have been carrying out attacks across the border in Pakistan, but their country has never been in the game of blaming While the responsibility of security in Afghanistan lies with the American security forces
 unhone kaha ki yah pakistan or america donon ke hit main he ki ve is rishte ko kaayam rakhen
 Hina said, however, that this relationship is not one that has complete similarities
 ve mahashakti hai or ham nahin he, lekin yah rishta samprabhutaa ke aadhaar par samanta kaa he
 He said that both countries need a couple and Pakistan wants to maintain a relationship with the US, but the sovereignty of Pakistan should be respected by the US
 pakistani videsh mantri ne kaha, hamaare pakistani bhaaiyon or bahanon ko jaananaa chahie ki unka desh america par nirbhar nahin he
 There is no economic and military dependency here
 unki ore se sahyog miltaa he or ham chaahate hai ki yah madad behatar dhang se aae
 Hina said, it would be right to say in private that there are serious problems in the relationship between the two countries
 yah pakistan ke bhale ke liye he ki vah apane rashtriya hit kii hifaazat kare or unka saath jitna ho sake utana nibhaae

 In the last election, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath called Hanuman ji a tribal dalit, which created a lot of controversy

 unka kahana he ki kisi samasya ko dur karnaa he to samasya ke saath rahanaa hoga
 They know very well how the hope of not having electricity in the village fades because they have suffered the sufferings of their village Nemit in Jhinya tehsil of tribal-dominated Khargone district

 Reason: Lack of means of irrigation

 Now that Sunita of village Kodala is getting up in the evening, there is no worry that if she does not have electricity, then how will she study
 use ghaslate laane kii bhi phikr nahin, uske paas ab solar lite jo he
 Shubham Tanwar of seventh grade states that a five watt lamp with LED bulb illuminates a room for four hours
 gaanv ke log ab sinchai ke liye solar energy ke istemaal par vichaar karne lage hai
 Ghanshyam Gaur of village Shivna says that if the price of solar pump decreases, many farmers can go towards this
