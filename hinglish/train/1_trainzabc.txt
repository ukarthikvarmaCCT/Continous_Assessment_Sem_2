 a senior state official says, "his (ajit Doval's) presence has ensured coordination between the forces
" 
 
 "id ke shantipurvak biit jane ke baad NSA ne jammu evam kashmir police tathaa CRPF se baatcheet kii, or kanoon evam vyavastha ko banaae rakhane ke liye unke dwaara lambe-lambe samay tak kii ja rahi duty kii saraahna bhi kii
 a senior official told NDTV, "NSA appreciated the level of commitment and hard work of our people
 
 
 "jab anantnag main NSA ajit dobhaal ne logon se poocha-koi takalif to nahin he? to mila ye jawaab, dekhen- videoyaham raisina hills main maujuud naukarshahon kaa bhi kahana he ki pradhanmantri ne ek ranneetik faisle ke tahat apane sabase bharosemand 'leftinent' ko vahaan bheja, taaki sahi jaankaree sidhe hasil ho sake tathaa halaat ke hisaab se suraksha sambandhi faisle bhi jald se jald liye ja saken, or unhen samay ganvaae bina lagu bhi kiya ja sake

 "he also informed that Doval is reviewing every aspect of security itself to keep every information secure
 jammu-kashmir sarkaar ne NSA ajit dowaal se lee sikh, adhikariyon se kaha ki har din
 
 
 a senior police officer said with a smile, "when this bill was introduced in the Rajya Sabha, three major challenges were facing the government - the Zuma prayers before Eid, Eid and then Independence Day
 
 
 surakshabalon kii lagaataar koshishon se do shantipurvak biit chuke hai, or ab sabhi kii nazar swatantraaa diwas ko lekar kii ja rahi taiyaariyon par hai, or ajit dobhaal ke yahaan hone kii vajah se sabhi agenciyaan behtareen kaam kar rahi hai
 
 
 "actually, in the last few days Ajit Doval has visited all the districts sensitive to terrorism - Shopian, Pulwama and Anantnag
 ek adhikari ke mutabik, "yah pratikatmak kadam tha, or isse yah bhi sunishchit hua ki sabhi agenciyaan ek duusare ke saath milakar kaam karen

 Most of the new recruits from terrorist groups are also from this region
 kuch aisa he ajit dobhaal ke jasoos se NSA banane tak kaa safar, jaaniye 10 khaas batedhikariyon ke anusaar, apane daure main NSA kaa sabase zyaada dhyaan is baat par rahata he ki gharelu aatankwaad ke mudde ko kaise hal kiya jaae
 Officials said that Ajit Doval confesses that this will be the biggest challenge for the security forces in the coming days
 vibhinn balon se baatcheet main ajit dobhaal yah salaah bhi dete rahe hai ki puri tarah sanyam bartaa jaae, or kisi bhi jaani nuksaan se bachane kii puri koshish kii jaae
 According to an official, "it is very easy to say, because the forces with vested interests across the border will try to provoke the security forces, and it will also try to serve fake stories, spread rumors through the use of social media, So that emotion can be stirred up, as it did in 2008 (amarnath land dispute), 2010 (street protests) and 2016 (burhan Wani's death) Was

 When Anna was asked again and again, he avoided saying that he will tell when the time comes

 kya bhojpuri gaanon or sania mirza ke bich koi rishta ho saktaa he? kya sania mirza bhojpuri film or sangeet industry se apana judaav khud jaanati he? ve jaane yaa na jaane, par yah to daawey ke saath kaha ja saktaa ki sania ab bhojpuri gaanon kii oickon ban chuki hai
 Bhojpuri Music Industry of Bihar likes Sania Mirza of Hyderabad more than the 'tennis sensation' for Sania's beauty and 'nathuni' of her nose, which connects her to Bihar
 yun to dhundne par bhi sania or bhojpuri sangeet main dur-dur tak koi rishta nahin mil saktaa, par sania main kuch to aisa he, jo unhen bhojpuri gaanon se jodta he
 That is why not only has more than a dozen Bhojpuri songs written on Sania, but some songs have broken all records of popularity
 ek bhojpuri geet aaj kal logon ke sir chadhakar bol rahaa he, 'sania mirza cat nathunia jaan marela
 
 
 'this song has destroyed all records of popularity of Bhojpuri songs
 neeche die geet ko aap dekh or sun bhi sakate hai:bhojpuri geetkaar or vartmaan nirdaleey vidhayak vinay bihari ne sania mirza par kai geet likhe, jise pawan singh ne gaaya
 These songs include 'sania Mirza Kat Nathuniya Jan Marela'
 
 
 ' sabase jyaad hit isliye hua, kyonki isamen us 'nathunia' shabd kaa zikr tha, jo sania ko bihar se jodta he
 Sania's nose nostrils increase her beauty manifold, that's why Bhojpuri music caught Sania in her hands
 bhojpuri ke mashhoor gayak pawan singh ne akele 3 gane sania mirza par gaae hai, jo you-tub par maujuud he
 Vinay Bihari says that the type of Nathuni Sania Mirza wore and which later became fashion, is actually 'nathuniya' worn in the nose of the girls of village-countryside in Bihar
 bihar main 'nathunia' soundarya or maadakta kaa pratik he
 This drunkenness and beauty forced Bhojpuri songwriters to write songs on Sania
 sirf ek gaanaa nahin, sania par kai-kai gane likhe gaye
 a song in the Bhojpuri film 'jung' came into the limelight when Sania married Pakistani cricketer Shoaib Malik and chose Pakistan's in-laws
 gane ke bol ab bhi logon kii jubaan par hai, 'sania mirza chal gaili pakistan ho
 
 
 'bhojpuri music is contemporary
 har badi-choti ghatnaon kii jhalak bhojpuri gaanon main milti he
 One is Sania's beauty, stories related to her from above and controversy created many songs
 lekin bhojpuri film industry kii maane, to sania bhojpuri bhashi ilaakon main jitani lokapriy hai, utani lokapriyata to bhojpuri filmon kii kisi superstar heroin kii bhi nahin he
 Vinay Bihari says that if a survey is done in Bhojpuri areas, then no actress can stand in front of Sania
 wo isaki vajah yah bataate hai ki sania kii khubsuurati main maadakta he, jiske peeche bhojpuri film or sangeet industry divaani he
 The perfect cancer completes Sania's Nathunia and the stories and controversies associated with her
 vinay bihari ke mutabik, bhojpuri ilaakon main sania kii tasviren itani bikin ki isane sochane par vivash kar diya
 In the room of Bhojpuri-speaking youth, the most pictures of Sania are seen in Nathunia
 bhojpuri ke mashhoor gayak or abhinayta anand mohan pandey ke mutabik, sania ke chehre kii banaavat or sundarataa unhen 'bihari bala' kaa luk dete hai
 The right cancer completes the nostril of the nose, making her a complete 'bhojpuria girl', which is in every young man's imagination
 anand mohan pandey ke mutabik, sania kii khubsuurati or us par nathuni, sone main sugandh jaisaa hi he
 Anand Mohan is the first singer who sang the first song on Sania, even when Sania was not married to Shoaib
 tab geetkaar kii kalpana sania kii shaadi mahendra singh dhoni se karaane kii thi, jiske liye lalu prasad or tab ke jharkhand ke mukhyamantri madhu kodaa se pahal kii guhaar thi
 People still remember the lyrics of that song, 'lalu bhaiya batiya maan, bana jaa aguya baat nahin
 
 
 madhu kodaa ke manaav naa, maahi ke jog baadi sania mirza jaldi biyah karav naa
 
 
 'this song is available on youtube
 maje kii baat yah he ki sania mirza aaj tak bihar nahin ai hai, lekin bhojpuri unhen apana maan chuki he
 Actually Sania Mirza's Bhojpuri look and Bhojpuria beauty is the relationship that has connected her so much to Bhojpuri music that she has become the icon of Bhojpuri songs industry of Bihar
 wo jab tak surkhiyon main rahengi, bhojpuri sangeet industry un par apana haq jamaati rahegi

 India's morale has dropped after losing the first Test by 196 runs
 use ab mejabaan ko sheersh ranking par kabiz hone se rokane ke liye behtareen pradarshan karnaa hoga
 However, the injury of fast bowler Zaheer Khan and poor form of Harbhajan Singh has increased India's difficulties
 vahiin gautam gambhir kaa duusare test main khelnaa sandigdh he
 Apart from this, some of the top Indian batsmen did not appear in form
 jahir ke baahar rahane par es srisanth yaa munaf patel ko jagah di jaayegi
 The Indian team would like to get down with three fast bowlers and a spinner as the Trent Bridge pitch is helpful for the fast bowlers
 bhartiya team ke liye sukun kii baat yah ho sakati he ki pichley chaar saal main saat dauron main se paanch main (bangladesh ko chhodkar) usne pehla test ganvaaya he lekin 2008 main srilanka daure ko chhodkar kahin bhi shrinkhalaa nahin ganvaai
 Last year, India also made a comeback after falling behind in Sri Lanka
 dakshin africa ke khilaaf apni mejabani main or vahaan kheli gai shrinkhlaon main bhi aisa dekhne ko mila
 Despite this one cannot ignore the fact that England have won 12 of the last 17 Tests and lost only two
 lords test kii pehali pari main rahul dravid (naabad 103)ke shatak or duusari pari main vivies lakshmana (56) tathaa suresh raina (78) kii pariyon ko chhodkar bhartiya ballebaajon ne bilkul prabhavit nahin kiya
 Sachin Tendulkar, who stood a century away from his hundredth international century, also could not contribute
 lords test main mansapeshi main khinchaav ke shikaar jahir pehle din ke baad gendbaaji nahin kar sake jisase eshanth sharma or praveen kumaar par boj batch gaya
 The England team proved to be dwarfing the Indian bowlers without the contributions of Andrew Strauss, Alastair Cook and Eoin Morgan
 is bich harbhajan kaa farm bhi chintaa kaa sabab he
 At Lord's, he took just one wicket for 218 runs
 agle match main amit mishra ko mauka dene se pehle team prabandhan ko kaaphi maathapai kerani hogi kyonki is leg spinner ne abhyaas match nahin khelaa he
 England, on the other hand, will have to avoid complacency
 lords par uske sabhi khilaadi farm main dikhe
 Kevin Pietersen scored a double century
 mat praayar ne duusari pari main shatak jamaaya or stuart broad bhi form main laute
 England will have to win the series 2–0 or 3–1 to remove India from the number one ranking in Test cricket
 trent brij kii pich tej gendbaajon kii madadgaar he jis par james anderson, stuart broad or kris tremelet kahar barapa sakate hai
 All three are in excellent form

 At a time when the Indian team is struggling to stay in the series, the attention of Sachin Tendulkar's hundred international century has been lost

 # zindagiyehzindagia post shared by Ayesha Takia Azmi (@ayeshatakia) on Jun 16, 2017 at 10:47pm PDT Arun Jaitley has said in response to the Congress's reply that it is surprising that a moral economic move is being termed as loot
 kaala dhan ko mitaane kaa yah kadam athical bhi tha or moral bhi
 Like neem-coated urea, demonetisation is also tied to demonetisation
 is par pratap bhanu mehta ne indian express main ek lekh likhaa he
 In which he writes on the matter of morality that morality was emphasized to an extreme extent more than the practical reality behind the step of demonetisation
 is naitikta ko yaad nahin rahaa ki blike paise kaa apana koi prakritik swabhaav nahin he
 There is a doubt that demonetisation may have hurt the complex mechanisms of hiding money
 balki ab is baat ke kuch pramaan bhi milte hai ki notebandi ke kaaran paise kii laundring ke nae tareeke bhi aa gaye hai
 Pratab Bhanu Mehta has also written that demonetisation was brought in the name of transparency, but political parties do not want to reveal the source of their donations
 naagarik to is paardarshita ke saath he magar raajnneetik dal kyon nahin chande kaa sorce bataate hai
 The government is aggressive about the benefits of demonetisation
 uske kai mantri or bade netaa desh ke alag alag hisson main daura kar rahe hai, press conference kar rahe hai
 Now we will not say anything on this
 samay barbaad hoga
 Finance Minister Jaitley has told that transactions of one and a half to two and a quarter to two lakh crores are kept under suspicious scope
 ve ise sandigdh kehete samay kaaphi saavdhaanee baratate hai
 The newspapers do not take this caution while printing, directly write that the amount of one and a half lakh crores is doubtful
 jabaki ek saal baad vitt mantri kah rahe hai ki iskar vibhaag or anya jaanch agenciyon par nirbhar karata he ki ve data kaa moolyankan karen or kadam uthaaen
 Some steps have also been taken
 jetali ne yah bhi bataaya ki 22 lakh nae karadaata pichley saal jude the, is saal 6 lakh nae karadaata jude hai
 34 in tax deposit from self assessment
 25 pratishat kii vruddhi hui he
 Advance tax deposited by the corporate has increased by 42 percent
 surat ke kapadaa vyapaaree notebandi se lekar jiesti se pareshaan hai
 Nobody was listening to them
 haalat ye ho gai hazaron kii sankhya main jamaa hokar ve pradarshan karte or khud hi tasviir khinch kar aapas main viral karte rahe taaki media ko kos saken ki dilli ke channel unki pareshaani ko nahin dikhaate hai
 There were also some amendments in the GST Council meetings but they did not benefit from it
 surat kaa kapadaa vyapaar sankat se nahin ubar sakaa
 The election has come that all the big leaders of the BJP are asking the condition of the businessmen of Surat
 amit shah bhi surat gaye or rahul gandhi bhi
 Rahul Gandhi reached the factory of the weavers and tried to understand the problem of imposing GST on yarn
 surat main 3 karod meter kapadaa rose banataa he, jabaki pehle saadhe chaar karod kapadaa banataa tha
 Diamond traders are also in crisis here
 unka bhi kaam 30-40 pratishat kam ho gaya he
 Here 5 to 6 lakh laborers have lost their work
 rahul gandhi ne baad main kapadaa vyapaariyon se unki samasyaayein suni
 The extent of the crisis in the market at this time is due to demonetisation and to what extent GST is difficult to say
 siemii, centre for monitering indian iconomi ne rojgaar par ek nayaa data prakashit kiya he
 Between January and April this year 1
5 million jobs have been lost
 share bazaar kii companiyon main bhi naukariyon kii sankhya kam hui he
 There are 14,668 jobs lost in 107 companies
 siemii kaa kahana he ki lebar beuro ke anusaar pichley saal aktubar se disambar ke bich 1 lakh 52 hazaar cajual or 46,000 part time naukariyaan samaapt ho gayi
 It was a time of demonetisation
 taminladu kaa ek shahar he trishur
 Textile is the stronghold of the sector, but also a bigger stronghold than Surat
 hamaari yahaan pahunch to nahin he magar ek vyapaaree bhai kii madad se maine kuch tasviren mangai
 Asked them to send today's picture
 tirupur ke bare main angrezi akhbaar indian express, bijness standard main kaaphi kuch chap rahaa he
 i also wanted to see what Tirupur looks like but thankfully the Hindi speaking businessman said yes to help
 apana naam nahin bataanaa chaahate hai, aap jaanate hi hai ki iske kya kaaran ho sakate hai
 This picture is from Kadar Peta Bazaar of Tirupur
 tamil main gali ko pet bolte hai
 It is adjacent to the market station
 aam dinon main yahaan til dharne kii jagah nahin hoti magar 8 november kii yah tasviir aap khud dekh sakate hai
 Roads are looking empty
 dukaan ke bheetar tishart tange hai magar karidaar nahin hai
 Five lakh people get work in Tirupur but due to demonetisation and GST, work has been lost to one lakh people
 dollar city ke niryaatak bhi sankat main hai
 All the big brands of under-garment manufacturing are here
 notebandi or jiesti kaa laabh hota to yahaan bhi jashn kaa maahaul hota magar is diwali yahaan 50 fisadi maal nahin bika he
 Due to demonetisation, the goods which were delivered at the advance have not yet returned in full
 pehle ek maheene main kharidaar se pement aa jaataa tha, ab yahaan ke manyafacturer ko chaar chaar maheene intazaar karne padate hai
 The businessman who sent the picture told that such silence happens in the holidays, but even if there is no holiday, the market looks like closed
 diwali kii chuttee par gaye mazaduron ko waapas kam hi log bula rahe hai
 This picture, which has a shutter down of the factory, has grown grass, is currently closed
 tirupur main 50 pratishat unit band hai yaa kam kshamta par chal rahi hai, baaki sankat se jujh rahi hai
 In this unit you can see that many machines do not have workers
 ab aap jo tasviir dekh rahe hai wo yarn factory kii he jo chal rahi he or puri tarah se automatic he, iske kaaran bhi rojgaar kam hua he
 We were told by a businessman that he has fired 150 workers due to demonetisation and GST
 baaki jo dhai sau hai unke liye puraa kaam nahin he
 Business in Tirupur has come down by 40 per cent
 ek vyapaaree ne bataaya ki is diwali ke liye das lakh pis taiyaar kar rakhaa tha magar chaar lakh pis hi bik sakaa
 Six lakh pieces are lying in the warehouse, due to which the production of new pieces is stopped
 jo kapaniyon main manager acountint ban gaye the wo waapas mazaduri kii taraf laut gaye hai
 Thousands of laborers have migrated to Bihar, Orissa
 diwali ke baad abhi tak lebar ko bulaane kaa silsilaa shuru nahin hua he
 The hotels here are also empty
 indian express kii story padhiega
 KS Ramdas spent twenty years building a sewing unit, 15 women worked here and KS Ramdas earned 20-25 thousand a week
 aaj apni unit main ramdaas or unki patni hi kaam kar rahe hai or hafte main 25 kii jagah do hazaar hi kama paa rahe hai
 Did you see his agony in a press conference? kai log kehete hai ki kisi chiz ko thik hone main time chahie to kya us chiz ke karne main sabase nahin poocha janaa chahie tha
 What was the fault of the traders and workers here
 kya jab sab thik ho jayega to inke lakhon se lekar karodon ke ghate kii bharpai hogi, kamgaaron se jo kaam chhina uski kya bharpai hogi? muradabad se ek vyapaaree ne bataaya ki notebandi ke baad kai kaamgaar i rickshaw chalaane lage or kaam ke liye nepal kii taraf palaayan kar gaye
 There are many stories, which are kept from coming to the fore, about which there is not a word in any press conference
 kaam ke avaras kahaan gaye agar notebandi or jiesti ne kamaal hi kar diya to
 It was not that people did not have skills
 tippaniyan As of July 2017, under the Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana, 30 lakh 67 thousand candidates were trained
 inamen se teen lakh logon ko bhi kaam nahin mila, aakhir 27 lakh log training lekar kahaan gaye, kya kar rahe hai
 This figure is also from the Ministry of Skills, which was published in the Indian Express on November 8 and has been published before
 kya kisi press conference main yah bataaya jaataa he ki hamane 30 lakh logon ko training di magar teen lakh logon ko hi rojgaar mili
 No

 There is no place to hold sesame seeds in normal days, but you can see this picture of November 8 itself
 sadaken khaali dikh rahi hai
 Tshirts are hung inside the shop but are not purchased

 Dollar City exporters are also in trouble
 under garment ke saare bade brands kii menuphaccharing yaheen hoti hai
 Had there been a benefit of demonetisation and GST, there would have been a festive atmosphere here, but this Diwali has not sold 50 percent of the goods here
 notebandi ke kaaran jo advance par maal diya tha wo abhi tak puraa nahin lautaa he
 Earlier, payment was received from the buyer in a month, now the manufacturer here has to wait for four months

 Will everything be repaid from the loss of lakhs to crores of rupees, what will be done by the work done by the workers? a businessman from Moradabad said that after demonetisation, many workers started driving e-rickshaws and migrated to Nepal for work
 kinati kahaniyaan hai, jo saamne aane se rah jaati hai jinke bare main kisi press conference main ek shabd nahin he

 Arvind Kumar said, the reason behind this is the PM2 of the country and Delhi
 5 str
 Recently the Berkeley Earth Organization of America has done a study, in which PM2 that damages lungs and other parts of the body
 5 kii kshamta ko cigarette ke dhuen ke saath sah-sambandhit kiya gaya tha, unka nishkarsh tha ki 22 microgram cubit meter piem2
 5 is equal to one cigarette
 agar aap 24 ghante tak 22 microgram ke sampark main aate hai to aapke sharir ko ek cigarette se hone vaala nuksaan ho rahaa he
 He said that if we look at the average of one year in Delhi, it was 140 to 150 micrograms of cubit meter, which in turn makes it six to seven cigarettes
 isliye ham sab dilli vaasiyon ne rojaanaa kam se kam chah se saat cigarette to pi hi hai, jabaki sardiyon main isaki sankhya 10 se 40 cigarette tak pahunch jaati he
 PM2 last year

 One thing is that if you do not change the filters of these air purifiers in a year, then it will become dirty

 The only mask a little protects is the N95 mask, but it cannot be worn too long as it is too hard and can only be applied for 10 to 15 minutes

 arvind kumaar ne kaha, mere liye to yah rashtriya apatkaal he, isamen sabhi ko turant saghan prayaas shuru kar dena chahie or ham ise kal ke liye taalenge to ham apane parso ko khatarnaak bana rahe hai
 On the question of what steps should be taken by the government to curb pollution, Professor Arvind said, the government should make and implement emissions of more than 500 coal-fired power plants at par with the emission standards of Western countries
 jab sarkaar paise kii kami kii baat karti he to vah logon ke jindagiyon ke saamne kuch bhi nahin he
 Therefore, the standards which are in factories should be implemented immediately, BS6 technology should be brought in petrol, diesel locomotives in our trains and immediate measures should be taken for the process of burning garbage in cities, in Delhi it is There has been a big problem and other metros are moving towards this very fast
 unhone kaha, saath hi fasalon ke jalaane kii samasya maanavajanit he uskaa kitna bhi sakht upaay kyon na ho use kiya janaa chahie, chaahe uske liye sena ko shaamil kar yuddh str par uskaa samaadhaan nikaalnaa he to logon ke swasthya ke khatir use kiya janaa chahie, nahin to isaki baari keemat hamen chukaani padegi

 25 karod ru
 The amount has also been recovered
 gupta kaa apharan karne ke baad 24 sitambar ko apartaaon ne unhen chhod diya tha
 According to the police, Gupta's wife Sonia Gupta paid the kidnappers as ransom of Rs 5 crore without informing the police
 kii rakam muhaiyaa karai thi or uske baad hi gupta mukt ho sake
 Narayan said that the police had been looking for these vicious criminals since then
 11 or 12 aktubar ko police ko badi kamyaabi mili or do din ke bheetar gang ke 12 sadasyon ko giraftaar kar liya gaya
 All the accused arrested are from Meerut and Gautam Buddha Nagar districts

 Police are looking for 4 other kidnappers including this girl and Monu
 sutron ke mutabik, 20-22 saal kii yah ladki padhi-likhi he or gupta kii company main hi kaam karti thi
 While making the kidnapping conspiracy, the same girl provided instant information to the rest of her colleagues about Gupta's movement and prepared the abduction plan
 esaspi ne kaha ki police is ladki kii sanliptata ke bare main padtaal kar rahi he, lekin usne philhal uski pahchaan jaahir nahin kii he
 According to sources, this girl is from Ghaziabad
 isse pehle jab farvari 2010 main gupta ke chartered accountint saurabh jain ko agava kar liya gaya tha tab bhi is ladki ne khaasi bhoomika nibhaai thi
 The police have identified the arrested accused as Kapil, Anshul Babra, Sandeep Kumar, Deepak, Vinay Kumar, Somveer, Anshul Putra Sushil, Pintu alias Pushpendra Kumar, Sandeep, Sanjeev, Ajay and Ish Kumar
 jahaan sanjeev gautamabuddhanagar jile kaa nivasee he, vahiin baaki 12 aaropee meerut jile ke rahane vaale hai
 According to the police, gang leader Anshul Babra belongs to a well-educated family and his father Mahendra Singh Babra was awarded the State Teacher Award in 2009 by the Uttar Pradesh government
 ek anya aaropee vinay kumaar meerut ke dabthua gaanv kaa rahane vaala he or peshey se payalat he
 The police recovered a part of the ransom from his house
 ek police adhikari ne bataaya ki is giroh main police ke ek head consteble kaa betaa bhi shaamil he
 This boy was instrumental in providing information to the gang about the activities of the police
 iske alaava pakade gaye kai aaropee beatech paas hai
 However, the police have not yet made their full details public
 uskaa daawa he ki is giroh ke sadsy isse pehle car chori or choti-moti aapraadhik vaardaat ko anjaam dete rahe hai or baad main ye apharan kii vaardaat se bhi jud gaye
 Giving details of the kidnapping, the SSP said, "the kidnapper kidnapped Gupta and took him to Greater Noida and was kept in a house there
 ham un daavon kii bhi padtaal kar rahe hai, jinamein kaha gaya he ki apartaaon ko police kii gatividhiyon kii jaankaree baraabar mil rahi thi
 We are also trying to find out whether this is the same gang that kidnapped Gupta's chartered accountant Saurabh Jain in February 2010
 ''jain ko bhi us samay 25 lakh ru
 Was redeemed after giving ransom
 badi sankhya main aropiyon ko pakadaney ke baavjood police is baat kaa khulaasa nahin kar rahi he ki aakhir greater noida ke kis makaan main apahrit ko rakhaa gaya or yah makaan kiskaa he
 It is understood that this house is connected to a leader of Greater Noida and hence the police is taking precaution in disclosing
 is ladki ke bare main koi suraag milane yaa anya giraftaareyon ke sawaal par narayan ne kaha, ''police talash main juty hui he
 Very soon there will be some more arrests and revelations in the case
 '' vaise bhi phiroti ke taur par di gai 5 karod ru
 75 lakh out of the amount of Rs
 ab bhi police kii pakad se baahar hai
 In such a situation, it is expected that after the arrest of this alleged gangster girl, new layers of the hi-tech kidnapper gang that are flourishing in the country will come out and it will also come to know how she got involved in this dangerous crime
 magar ek sawaal phir bhi apni jagah bana rahegaa ki yah kisi talim he jo ki payalat or ejiniyaron ko bhi apaherta bana detii he

 Devendra Fadnavis took the oath of Chief Minister in a dramatic manner in the morning but resigned in 80 hours
 aakhir tab kya hua tha, iske bare main devendra fadanvis ne ajtak se baat kii
 The former Maharashtra Chief Minister told that Ajit Pawar has told him that he has spoken to Sharad Pawar, only then he is ready to support
 maharashtra kii raajnneeti ke mudde par devendra fadanvis ne kya-kya kaha, padhein
 
 
 Question: Why took Ajit Pawar's support? Devendra Fadnavis: You have to get full information about it, because then Ajit Pawar said that he has talked to Sharad Pawar
 vah is bare main kaaphi dinon se baat kar rahe the, jab unhone samarthan kii baat kahi to rajyapal ko jaakar chitthee saunp di
 Because there were many technical problems, the oath was quick
 devendra fadanvis ne kaha ki maine ensipi ke vidhayakon se bhi baat kii or unhone kaha ki sharad pavaar ko is gathbandhan ke bare main pataa he
 Question: Did PM Modi give Sharad Pawar the cabinet offer? Devendra Fadnavis: Sharad Pawar is not telling the whole thing, there was a lot of talk between PM and Pawar which PM Modi will tell at the right time
 sharad pavaar sirf vahi bataa rahe hai, jo unke haq main tha
 We formed the government then because there were numbers, but everybody knows that NCP does what it says not
 sawaal: lagaataar ajit ke khilaaf rahe, phir ensipi ke saath sarkaar kyon banaai?devendra fadanvis:ensipi ke saath gathbandhan main unhen bhi dikkatein thim, donon ne ekadusre kaa virodh kiya he
 But when someone has cheated you, you have to be active in politics
 lekin ab jo ensipi ne shivasena-congress ke saath sarkaar banaakar kiya he, vah hamaare opshan main nahin he
 Devendra Fandavis also said that he is not aware of the clean chit given by Ajit Pawar to ACB
 vah is clin chit ke khilaaf hai
 Everyone knows that it was a scam
 sawaal:kya shivasena ke saath sudharenge sambandh?devendra fadanvis:ye sarkaar auto rickshaw sarkaar he, jo khud boj se gir jaaegi
 We did not run any Operation Lotus, only the Shiv Sena cheated
 aisa kabhi nahin hua ki uddhav thakare ne unase baat kii koshish kii ho or unhone manaa kar diya ho
 With this, Devendra Fadnavis said that Pankaja Munde and Eknath Khadse are senior leaders of the party, the resentment is because the government is not formed

 yadav ke ek kareebi netaa ne kaha, vah (kejariwal) jhukne ke icchhuk nahin hai or bhushan tathaa yadav ke istife kii maang kar rahe hai
 Even Ramdas attempted to intervene, but no solution was found
 bhushan or yadav kaa samarthan karne waalon kaa kahana he ki donon netaa kejariwal kii maangon ke saamne nahin jhukenge
 The party's supreme decision making body saw an internal rift in the PAC, where most of the members gave their strong support to Kejriwal

 Before the meeting, both Kejriwal and Yadav are trying to mobilize the support of the activists

 She expressed in her tweet that she did not like 'politics on electoral violence' and would take the issue far

 i had made up my mind to accept the constitutional invitation and to attend the swearing-in ceremony
 " unhone kaha, "haalanki pichley ek ghante se, main media rapaton ko dekh rahi hum jisamen bijepi kii ore se bengal main raajnneetik hinsa main 54 logon ke maare jane kii baat kahi gai he
 This is completely wrong
 bengal main koi raajnneetik hatya nahin hui he
 "one thing is clear from Mamata Banerjee's dharna that when the country and the world sees the oath of PM Modi, on the other hand, in Bengal, she will also see that anti-incarnation of Mamata Banerjee, in which she will be seen cursing from BJP to PM Modi and Amit Shah

 Excerpts from his talk, India Today Senior Editor Sweta Punjase: What are the challenges and lessons about GST since it came into force on 1 July? GST is a new law with new rules, it is new for everyone
 logon ko ise samajhaana or sweekaar karana badi chunauti he
 There is a lot of learning for the people of the tax sector
 aam logon ko isse koi matlab nahin he kyonki unki kar daron main khaas badlaav nahin aayaa he
 There are misconceptions among taxpayers about certain areas? One of the main provisions is reverse charging
 logon ko abhi vah samaj main nahin aayaa he isliye hamane chah maheene ke liye sthagit kar diya he
 The provision states that if a registered person buys goods (worth more than Rs
 5,000 per day) from a non-registered person then the responsibility of paying tax will be on the registered person
 isamen koi atirikt kar boj nahin he or anupaalan kaa boj bhi bahut maamuli he
 In such cases, every person has to create a single invoice for all purchases from an unregistered dealer and have to show the input tax credit as well as the external liability by filing the return
 use koi atirikt kar nahin dena padataa
 Is GST going to increase inflation? We do not think the rise in prices is an issue
 log do khaas kshetron ko lekar shikaayatein kar rahe hai
 One is restaurants - people are complaining that the tax has been imposed but the prices have not been reduced in the menu
 restaraan samoochaa kar vasuul kar le rahe hai, jo thik nahin he
 The second area is in real estate

 Jaspreet Bumrah
 
 
 naam hi kaaphi he kisi bhi batsman ko khauf main laane ke liye
 Yes, the pace with which India's pace attack leader, Bumrah, has made its way into the whole world is unmatched
 test cricket bumraah kitne ghaatak rahe hai iskaa saboot he mahaj 12 test main unka 62 wicket jhatakna
 This in itself explains why any batsman is shocked to see Bumrah in front of him on the bowling? Bumrah was given the chance to start in Test cricket in early 2018
 rhite orm, anorthodox bowlar bumraah ke liye har match ke saath desh-videsh main unke prashansakon kii sankhya badhati ja rahi he
 Shane Bond and Ricky Ponting, who worked with Bumrah in the IPL, had already predicted that they would be very successful in the Test
 apane time main khud bhi bharat ke ‘swing senceshan’ rah chuke irfan pathan kaa maananaa he ki test cricket ke expoger ne bumraah ko kahin zyada dhardaar banaaya
 Also ready for big matches
 irfan kehete hai, ‘international cricket khelte hue bumraah ne baahar jaati swinger ko viksit kiya
 Now he has complete command over it, due to Test cricket
 jab aap test cricket khelte hai, to aap ke saamne alag alag paristhitayon main bowling karne kii chunauti hoti he
 With the new ball, with the old ball in the second session and then with different balls in the final session
 ”irfan ne india today se kaha, “ek din main kam se kam teen se chaar spel karne hote hai
 From this, you learn a lot about yourself
 haa aapke paas guide karne ke liye coach hote hai, lekin ek bowlar ke naate aapako khud apane dimag kaa istemaal karnaa hota he
 This is the point
 bumraah ne haal main swing par shandaar control hasil kiya he
 His quick arm action is difficult for Batsman to read
 jis tarah wo short ran ap se out swinger nikaalte hai use khilne main kisi bhi batsman ko dikkat ho sakati he
 Bumrah is now using his weapon more and more
 west indies main unhen isane kaaphi safalataa dilaai
 Irfan says that Bumrah has improved a lot in the past
 irfan ke mutabik “jab bumraah ne international cricket khelnaa shuru kiya to wo apane bowling ran ap ko puraa karte hue baayin taraf ko thodaa girte the
 Now they live directly, so their balance remains
 bumraah ab donon taraf gend ko move karaane main kaamyaab hote hai
 This has given them a lot of strength
 ye sab hote hue bhi ek acchhee baat he ki bumraah kaa swaabhaavik bowling ection jas kaa tas he
 When you repeat your action again and again, you become the master of your art
 ”anil kumble bumraah main desh kaa sabase mahaan fast bowlar banane kii kaabiliyat bataa chuke hai
 All-time batting great Vivian Richards says that if he were asked to face, he would have preferred to play Dennis Lillee instead of Bumrah
 ye apane aap main hi bumraah ke liye bahut bada compliment he
 All the experts in Bumrah's skills are convincing
 irfan ke mutabik “bumraah ne bharat ke bowling atake ko kahin behatar bana diya he
 Now he is the best bowler in the world, whether the ranking says it or not
 nai gend ho yaa puraani, safed ho yaa laal, bumraah sabhi ke saath apni dhar barkaraar rakhte hai
 We are very fortunate to have a boomer like Bumrah

 The angry BJP workers got into a heated debate and scuffle on Tuesday evening over the appointment of an approved member in the Pune Municipal Corporation
 baat is had tak pahunchi kii gussaye bijepi kaaryakartaaon ne nagar palika sabhagrih netaa shrinath bhimale ke daftar main todphod kar daali
 Let me tell you that for the first time in the history of Pune Mahanagar Palika, the BJP party has got an absolute majority
 nagar palika main bijepi party ke 97 nagarsevak hone se bijepi party paanch sweekrut sadasyon main se teen sadsy niyukt kar sakati he
 BJP workers were competing for all three places
 apana nivedan dene ke liye pune nagarpalika main bijepi ke daftar main bheed lag gai thi
 Ganesh Ghosh, the president of the BJP Yuva Morcha, was being considered as the main contender
 lekin, antim samay main ganesh ghosh ke naam ke bajaay ganesh bidkar kaa naam liya gaya
 Apart from Ganesh Bidkar, Gopal Chintal and Raghunath Gowda were also fielded
 darasal, ganesh ghosh jinke naam ke charche party main ho rahe the, kii jagah ganesh bidkar kaa naam teen ummidavaaron kii suchi main liya gaya
 Seeing this, Ganesh Ghosh entered into the BJP office and created a ruckus
 hangaame ke dauraan daftar main todphod bhi ho gai jisamen teble kaa kaanch tut gaya
 Ganesh Ghosh and other interested members vandalized the office of Shrinath Bhimale, the municipality, over the election
 is ghatana par bijepi party kii ek leader orpune mahapalikaki mahayor mukta tilak yanahi ne khed vyakt kiya
 This incident also does not suit the BJP cadre, and he accepted that the BJP party will bear the expenses of the loss
 anna hajaare ne maunvrat todane ke baad centre sarkaar ko aade haathon lete hue kaha ki sarkaar majboot lokapal bill laane kii bajaae ise kamjor karne par amada he
 Take a glimpse of what Anna said to the media: - Their movement will continue till the formation of strong Lokpal
 -hisar main unki team ne jo kiya, vah keval is baat kii chetavanee thi ki jo party majboot lokapal nahin laaegi, uske khilaaf logon se matdaan karne kii apil kii jaaegi
 -if the government does not pass a strong Lokpal bill in the winter session of Parliament, they will campaign against a particular party in the upcoming assembly elections and will appeal to the people not to vote for that party
 -sarkaar se yah anurodh kiya jayega ki vah uttarakhand ke lokyukt bill kii tarj par centre main majboot lokapal kaa gathan kare
 The manner in which the bill was passed in Uttarakhand is commendable
 -centre sarkaar kii niyat saaf nahin he, isiilie vah lokapal bill ko tukade-tukade main baant rahi he
 -when there is already mention of Citizen Charter in Lokpal Bill, what is the need to bring it from the side
 -sarkaar kii niyat main hi khot he
 - Complaints against misbehavior are becoming victims of bullets
 -uttarakhand main aane vaale 4-5 maheenon main hi tasviir badal jaaegi
 The poor will get justice in the state
 -lokapal bill ko lekar bani sansad kii standing ke saamne puri baat rakhi jaaegi
 My silence was not against any person or party
 -ramlila maidan par 12 din ke anshan ke baad meraa swasthya kamjor ho gaya, isliye, mahatma gandhi dwaara bataae gaye ‘maun’ ke alaava mere paas doosraa koi vikalp nahin tha
 -if such a situation comes, you should remain silent
 -maun ke baad meri haalat main sudhaar hua he
 Blood pressure and weight are normal
 -hamen lokapal ke liye or bhrashtachar ke khilaaf ladanaa he
 - i have acquired new power to fight
 main ladaai ke liye taiyaar hum
 The Lokpal bill has passed after a long debate in the Lok Sabha on Tuesday
 yah bill kuch sanshodhano ke saath paas hua he, jo is prakaar hai- 1
 a two-thirds majority is now required instead of three-fourths for investigation against the Prime Minister
 2
 No action like confiscation of property of MP or MLA before corruption case is proved
 3
 The state itself will decide whether to appoint a Lokayukta or not
 4
 Military force, Coast Guard and public money-run trusts, companies out of scope
 left ke vasudev acharya ne corporates ko lokapal ke daayre main laane kaa sanshodhan rakhaa, lekin gir gaya
 But many amendments of the government passed
 loksabhaa main bahes ke baad jab voting kii baari ai to bahujan samaaj party or samaajawaadee party ke saansad sadan se walkout kar gaye
 After this, all the opposition amendments fell
 sarkaar ne lokapal kii ladaai kaa ek daur jeet liya he, lekin philhal yah jeet adhuri maani ja rahi he, kyonki rajyasabha main is bill par sarkaar kii kadi pariksha hogi
 On the other hand, Team Anna is afraid that the situation of Lokpal Bill may not be the same as the Women's Reservation Bill
 is bich aaj ramlila ground main team anna kii kor cameti kii baithak ho rahi he
 Team Anna is not happy with yesterday's Lok Sabha proceedings
 uskaa kahana he ki sanshodhano ke baavjood ye bill kamjor he
 Now she will plan the movement for the coming days
 30 taarikh se uskaa jail baro andolan apni jagah chalata rahegaa

 Two acres of land in the area adjoining Patna, worth about Rs 30 crore, is in the name of the family of Rashtriya Janata Dal President Lalu Yadav
 vipaksh ne aarope lagaaya ki yahi jameen kai ghotaalon kii asli vajah he
 Leader of Opposition in Bihar Sushil Modi says the documents show how this land was illegally transferred to the Yadav family
 ab is jameen par mal kaa nirmaan kaary jari he
 The opposition alleges that the land in Patna in the name of Lalu Yadav's sons, on which the construction of the mall is going on, was not only forcibly purchased from the Sanjay Gandhi Biological Park in Patna
 is jameen kaa malikana haq jis company ke paas he uske nideshak lalu ke donon bet or rabari devi hai
 In 2008, this land was sold to Sarla Gupta, whose husband Prem Gupta is an MP from Lalu's party
 sarala gupta 'dilite marketing company' kii malkin thi
 The land was sold by three brothers Harsha, Vinay and Vijay Kochhar, who own the Chanakya Hotel
 yah bikri chanakya ko railway ke ranchi or puri ke do hotalon ko lij par chalaane kii anumati milane ke do maah pehle hui thi
 At that time Lalu Yadav was the railway minister in the UPA government
 modi ne aarope lagaaya ki yah mahaj sanyog nahin he ki chanakya ne yah jameen hotel chalaane kaa theka milane ke pehle bechi
 However, sources associated with Lalu's party say that Chanakya had made a tremendous bid and won the hotel contract from the railway for 15 years in a fair manner
 2104 main, tej pratap or tejasvi yadav or bahan chanda yadav ko is company ke nideshak ko taur par joda gaya
 Rabri Devi was then made director in this company
 is varsh farvari main ek or vilay hua jisamen rabari devi or unke bete nideshak hai
 All companies are registered at the same address
 modi ne aarope lagaaya ki isi jameen par rajd ke sursand se vidhayak saiyad abu daujana kii company 'meridian construction (india) limited' dwaara shopping mal kaa nirmaan karavaaya ja rahaa he jise bihar kaa sabase bada mal bataaya ja rahaa he
 Leader of the Opposition Sushil Modi says that it is clear that the land given by Lalu Yadav is the property of the Railways
 vahiin lalu ke kareebi netaaon kaa kahana he ki lallan singh or shivanand tiwari is maamle ko lekar patna hoicourt or supreme court ja chuke he, jahaan unki sibiai jaanch kii maang kaarij ho chuki he
 The comments vahiin jaanakar maanate hai ki mal kaa nirmaan lalu yadav or unke mahagathbandhan ke liye rajintik rup se mahangaa pad saktaa he
 In Bihar, sitting on the pretext of the soil, the opposition got an issue
 vahiin rashtriya janata dal ke netaa bhi maanate hai ki modi or yogi ke jamaane main unke supremeo agar parivaar ke sadsy ke naam par mal kaa nirmaan karte hai to chunaav main unki naiya ko doobane se koi nahin bachaa saktaa
 In the meantime, the issue is deepening on how the purchase of 45 lakhs of soil was done on the basis of quotation without tendering
 van vibhaag jiske tahat yah jaivik udyaan aata he uske adhikari bhi maanate hai ki haal ke varshon main itani adhik raashi kaa kharch maatra kotesan ke aadhaar par karne kii koi parampara unhen yaad nahin, lekin is puure vivaad ke centre main patna chidyaghar ke nideshak nand kishor kaa daawa he ki sab kuch niyam sangat kiya gaya he or unhone kaha ki jis thekedaar ne mitti kii aapurti kii he uskaa kahana he ki unhone mitti nirmaanadhin mal kii site se nahin lee he

 At the same time, knowing that the construction of the mall can be politically expensive for Lalu Yadav and his grand alliance
 mitti ke bahaane baithe bithaye bihar main vipaksh ko ek mudda mil gaya
 At the same time, the leaders of the Rashtriya Janata Dal also believe that in the era of Modi and Yogi, if their supremo builds a mall in the name of a family member, then no one can save their eyes from drowning in the elections
 is bich is mudde par vivaad gaharaata ja rahaa he ki 45 lakh kii mitti kii kharid bina nivida ke maatr kotesan ke aadhaar par kaise kii gai
 The officials of the forest department under which this organic garden comes also believe that in recent years they do not remember any tradition of spending so much amount on the basis of quotations, but at the center of this whole controversy, the director of Patna Zoo, Nand Kishore Claims that everything has been made rules and he said that the contractor who supplied the soil says that he has made the soil under construction Not taken from the site of the mall

 Priya also recited that poem from the stage of Sahitya Aaj Tak

 At the end of the poem, people clapped fiercely

 "the thought was that whenever we would meet like the last chapter of a novel, the story would have gone ahead, but still the reader would hold his heart in his fingers and clench his head thinking how the story should end, but nothing happened

 Who is the villain of the film 'sanju'? 
 
 ?raju hiraani ke mutabik vah press,jo sutron ke mutabik yaa prashnvachak chihn lagaakar afavaahon ko khabaron kii tarah pesh karata he
 This complaint from the media has been given such importance in the film that the film ends with a song, in which the media has been made fun of
 yah sach he ki media kai baar gairzimmedaar dhang se pesh aata rahaa he
 He sometimes lives in fake pride of his strength
 kai baar duusare taqatvar log bhi uskaa yah bharam banaae rakhane main madadgaar hote hai
 Many times it seems that these powerful people do not want honest, only a dishonest media, not sensible, only media with sensation
 is media se sanjay dutt kii shikaayatein bhi jaays hongi,lekin ve adhuri shikaayatein hai
 The truth is that the entire entertainment industry - including Hindi films and its hero-heroines - makes the most of this sensational element of the media
 vah use badhaava bhi detaa he
 He needs the help of this media to create the magic of his otherwise magicless heroes
 use apni nayikaon kaa glamer dikhaane ke liye is media kii madad chahie
 The media is a partner in his game
 vah uski kharaab filmon ke pramotion main bhi madad karata he
 a crisis arises when this media starts doing this game in its own way
 yah anayas nahin he ki jo abhinayta kabhi apane sangharsh ke daur main media ke peeche bhaagate rahete hai - apane star hone ke baad sabase zyaada media se chidhane lagate hai
 It has been the style from Amitabh Bachchan to Sanjay Dutt
 lekin yah media or sitaron ke bich lucatipi yaa chor-sipaahi ke khel kaa maamla nahin he
 The film 'sanju', which claims to be the 'biopic' of actor Abhinay Dutt, actually picks up many facts from its convenience and ignores many
 is par bhi kisi ko aitaraaz karne kaa haq nahin he
 a person has the right to keep the parts of his life in front of people and hide the rest
 lekin ek madhyam ke taur par kisi achche cinema ke liye sankat yaheen se shuru hota he
 When you start cutting and pruning lives with very careful steps, they become lifeless - their vibrations keep going, which also makes their irony and fantasies
 sanjay dutt kii film ke saath bhi yahi hua he
 The best parts of this film are those when he is seen battling drugs, because here he is really encountering the reality he has lived
 lekin jahaan babari masjid or baad ke dangon kii kahani shuru hoti he,jahaan sanju ke hathiyaar rakhane,tada act main funsane or chhootane or jail jane or jail kaatane kii baat saamne aati he,vahaan film kahin kuch sthool,kuch naatakeey or kahin-kahin kuch nakli bhi ho jaati he
 After this, the film in its entirety becomes the story of the emotional relationship of the father-son - the son's discomfort is pierced in the father's chest, the son's undying love is left untold in front of the father
 in sabakaa asar yah hua he ki sanjay dutt ke jivan main dilchaspee kii vajah se kamai ke record todane vaali yah film raju hiraani ke kariyar kii sabase qamazor film sabit hui he
 'sanju' doesn't stand anywhere compared to 'munna Bhai MBBS', 'lage Raho Munnabhai', 'three Idiots' or 'PK'
 mushkil yah he ki'sanju'ke sabase kamazor hisson main ek villen dhundhane nikle raju hiraani media ko sabase aasaan shikaar pate hai - yah bhulaate hue ki media jo khel karata he,usamen bollywood kii apni saajhedaari kam nahin hoti
 Secondly, just as Raju Hirani has chosen the facts he wants about 'sanju', he has also chosen about the media
 jabaki sachai yah he ki media jab khel karata he,to surakshit rahata he,jab vah khabar karata he,to khatare main hota he
 It is not uncharacteristic that just a few days before the release of 'sanju', a journalist was shot dead by terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir, and shortly before this comment was written, Maharashtra Police is searching for a journalist who has set up an event
 Booking of press club was done
 raju hiraani kii sabase badi vifaltaa darasal yahi he -'sanju'dekhakar na sanjay dutt ke bare main puri raay banati he or na hi media ke bare main sachhee raay milti he
