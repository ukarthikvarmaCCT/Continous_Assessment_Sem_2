 Neelam said, 'we want Uddhav ji to be CM

 'maharashtra main 15 oktober ko chunaav hone hai
 But bjp-shiv Sena is not taking the name of resolving the seats
 shivasena ne pehle hi bataa diya he ki maharashtra main mukhyamantri shivasena kaa hi banegaa, lekin bataaya jaataa he ki bijepi is baat par taiyaar nahin he
 Both parties want maximum seats in the assembly elections

 Uddhav had said that in the Lok Sabha elections, people voted for a face of change (modi) and Shiv Sena's contribution to the victory in Maharashtra cannot be ignored
 unhone kaha, ‘kya modi lahar tamilnadu, punjab, oreisha or pashchim bengal main dikhi? yah gathbandhan sahyogiyon par bhi nirbhar karata he
 Modi is the Prime Minister of our alliance
 ’bhandari ne kaha ki aisa pehali baar nahin he jab uddhav ne modi ke upar ‘apmanjanak’ tippaniyan kii hai
 He also said that the leadership takes the final decision based on grassroots workers
 unhone kaha, ‘kaaryakarta sabhi vaartaayen khatm hoti dekhnaa chaahate hai or netritv aakhir main apane jamini str ke kaaryakartaaon kii sunata he kyonki vahi jamini str par saare kaam karte hai

 gujarat main lambey samay se sattarudh dal BJP ke aankh kii kirakiri bane hue patidaar anamat andolan ke netritvkarta hardik patel lagbhag congress ke paksh main najar aa rahe hai
 However, he has kept himself away from the party till now
 gujarat vidhansabha chunaav main hardik par bhoomika behad ahm maani ja rahi he
 Aaj Tak spoke directly to Hardik on the whole situation
 hardik kii jubaani unke bebaak jawaab-ajtak- hardik patel kiske saath?hardik- jo hamaare adhikaar ki baat karegaa ham uske saath hai
 BJP has not spoken about our rights in 20 years
 congress ke saath baithak hui or unhone sakaaratmak baat kii
 It is true that if the Congress is in opposition, then it will not implement it from now on
 lekin ve aashwaasan de rahe hai, or logon ke bich main de rahe hai, to ham achche logon ke saath khadey rahenge
 We will not join the party, will not campaign, but will be with good people
 ajtak- congress ne ab tak apana rukh saaf nahin kiya he?hardik- ye acchhee baat kahi
 If they were wrong, they would have said that we accept your condition, but they spoke legally to implement it
 do saal ki ladaai main 2-4 din intjaar karnaa koi dikkat vaali baat nahin he kya he
 Aaj Tak- Congress has accepted your four things
 congress chunaav jeetne ke baad kya use nibhaayegi?hardik- un logon ne choti-choti baaten acchhee tarah samajhaayin
 If they were not to do, they would say that they will give reservation
 phir kah dete nahin karnaa, kya kar lete ham log
 They have four conditions, which they will perform well
 paanchaven mudde par 2-4 din main faisla hoga
 If they feel that the people who did not put them in power for 25 years, they have trusted them and put them in power, then they will also believe that they will work for them
 ajtak- mukhyamantri ne kal kaha ki hardik apana stand clear karen?hardik- vijay rupani ko kya dikkat he mere stand se
 He said that 10 per cent has been given to OBC, but 10 per cent given to OBC, decide where your reservation has been applied
 vah pravaktaa ke taur par bolte hai, vah CM hai, ye unhen maaloom nahin hai
 My stand is clear, i am with the public
 ajtak- aap rahul gandhi kii raily main jaaenge yaa kahin or mulaakaat karenge?hardik- yah saaf he ki main koi stage share karne vaala nahi hum
 It is quite clear
 abhi hamaari meeting he, 3 november ko rahul surat main hai
 If the reservation formula will be cleared on November 3, or it will be decided in the core committee
 ajtak- kor cameti ke baad faisla liya jayega?hardik- main unase baatcheet karuunga
 i am not the only lidar that what i say is right
 narendra bhai kii tarah mujhe akele faisla lenaa nahin aata
 Aaj Tak- Patidar is in jail in 2002 riots case? Hardik - 145 Patidars are still in jail in riots
 bahut saare log aaj bhi perol par chhutate hai to mujhase kehete hai ki hardik bhai is mudde ko aap rakho
 But on what issues does the BJP talk, on the issue of terrorism, the BJP talks on the issue of Hindutva
 chaahe voibhjhf ho RSS ho yaa vhpho
 But they do not get money orders of Rs 200 for Patidars in jail, they do nothing for bail
 hindutv ke naam par theke le rakhe hai
 We are also Hindus, we are Patels, we were persecuted and where did the BJP go
 aresas vaale to atyaachaar karte hai
 Whenever it comes to riots, leaders start glowing by talking about Hindutva
 ajtak- khafa kisase hai, BJP yaa RSS se?hardik- ham sabase khafa hai
 We are angry with what does not speak of our rights
 RSS ke zyaadaatar log patidaar the
 But when the issue of reservation came, all the people backed away
 ajtak- kya aap congress ke saath hai?hardik- yah saaf he ki main bhaajapa ke khilaaf hum
 But with whom i am not clear
 dhai saal tak main logon ke mudde ke liye ladata rahaa hum or ladata rahoonga
 Aaj Tak- Hardik will support the Congress, but will the Patidar society support Hardik? Hardik- You saw the 2015 panchayat elections to see who the people are with
 ab to patidaaron ke saath pura obisi samaaj aa gaya he, asti samaaj aa gaya he, kisaan aa gaya he, vyapaaree aa gaye hai, yuva hai, notebandi ke baad mahilaayein aa gai hai
 They are all angry that their saved money has also gone away
 6 karod kii janata he,hardik akelaa nahinhai
 Aaj Tak- People are angry with BJP, but will they vote for Congress? Hardik- People are angry with BJP
 main baar-baar kahata hum ki jin logon ko aapane 25 saal tak satta main nahin bithaaya vah ab thode to hoshiyaar hue honge
 Chance should be given once
 parivartan sansar kaa niyam he
 If they do well then they should sit
 main nahin kah saktaa ki ise bithaao use bithaao
 Aaj Tak- Your point is in support of Congress? Hardik- i do not talk in support of Congress
 lekin swaabhaavik he ki jab vipaksh hota he or sattapaksh ke khilaaf baat hoti he to logon ko lagata he ki main vipaksh ke samarthan main hum
 My words are bitter
 ajtak- congress aarakshan ki baat nahin karti he to kya

 1
 shank se na chadhayen jal:bhagwaan shiv ne shankhachud naam ke asur kaa vadh kiya tha
 The conch is considered the symbol of the same asura, who was a devotee of Lord Vishnu
 isliye vishnu bhagwaan kii puja shankh se hoti he, shiv kii nahin
 2
 na chadhayen tulsi kaa patta:tulsi ko bhagwaan vishnu ne patni rup main sweekaar kiya he
 Therefore Shiva is not worshiped with Tulsi
 3
 Do not offer anything made of til or sesame: It is believed to be originated from the scum of Lord Vishnu, so it should not be offered to Lord Shiva
 is stuti se jald prasann hote hai bholenath
 
 
 4
 kabhi na chadhayen toote hue chaaval:bhagwaan shiv ko akshat yani saabut chaaval arpit kiye jane ke bare main shastron main likhaa he
 Broken rice is incomplete and impure, so it does not climb Shivaji
 5
 Shiva does not like Kumkum: Kumkum is a symbol of good fortune, while Lord Shiva is a recluse, therefore Shiva does not climb Kumkum
 6
 Turmeric and Coconut Water: Turmeric is associated with Lord Vishnu and fortunately, therefore it does not offer to Lord Shiva and coconut is considered to be the symbol of Goddess Lakshmi, therefore, is not offered to Shiva

 congress-ncp, bjp-shiv Sena are all fighting as if they are strangers
 jabaki bijepi−shivasena gathbandhan 25 saalon se saath hai or congress−ensipi 15 saalon se saath sarkaar chalaa rahi he
 But the matter is not being formed
 bijepi-shivasena ko lagata he ki is baar satta unki aani hi he aise main koun banegaa mukhyamantri sabase bada sawaal he
 Who would want to miss such an opportunity? bijepi jaahir he ki loksabhaa chunaav ke baad kaaphi utsahit he or modi lahar kaa phayda uthaanaa chaahati he
 There are also some smaller parties which are swinging between BJP and Shiv Sena
 yah pehla chunaav he, vidhansabha kaa jab bal thakare nahin hai
 Raj Thackeray is showing from his weakness
 unke vidhayak bijepi main shaamil ho rahe hai or taiyaar baithe hai
 According to the data, according to the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, BJP is ahead in 131 seats while Shiv Sena is on 100 seats
 jaahir he bijepi 130 siton se peeche nahin hatana chaahati
 At the same time, Uddhav Thackeray has already said that Mission 150 means the goal of winning so many seats
 aise main gathbandhan kaa pench funs gaya he
 Also, the Shiv Sena already believes that the BJP fought more seats in the Lok Sabha and the Shiv Sena in the assembly
 ab tanatani itani bad gai he ki bade str par baatcheet nahin ho rahi he
 At the same time, the BJP has tried to pressurize the army by joining small parties like Raju Shetty's self-respecting Shetkari organization is leading in nine seats according to the Lok Sabha figures
 jaahir he vah kam se kam 10 siten chaahate hai, jabaki shivasena apni baat par ad gai he
 It seems that after 15 years, the chair of the Chief Minister of Maharashtra is slipping away from him
 vahiin, halaat congress or ensipi ke liye bhi achche nahin hai
 NCP is taking time by not talking
 vah is intjaar main bhi ho sakati he ki yadi shivasena−bijepi kaa gathbandhan tuutata he to ek mauka ho saktaa he nayaa gathbandhan banane kaa
 Experts believe that Ajit Pawar's strategy is different from Sharad Pawar's
 sharad pavaar jahaan sonia gandhi ko shaayad na nahin kah paane, vahiin ajit pavaar ke dil main sonia gandhi ke liye sharad pavaar jitani bhaavana nahin he
 Remind you that at one time Sonia Gandhi made Sharad Pawar the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha
 ajit pavaar ke liye dilli se adhik maharashtra kii raajnneeti myne rakhti he or ve jaanate hai ki sharad pavaar dilli kii raajnneeti main kamobesh apni pari khel chuke hai or dilli ab supriya sule ke hawaale he
 In such a situation, what will happen to Ajit Pawar's dream of becoming the Chief Minister of Maharashtra
 yahi vajah he ki ensipi ne dhai−dhai saal mukhyamantri kaa formula diya jisase congress bifer gai
 If we look at the 2014 Lok Sabha data, the Congress is ahead in only 16 assembly seats and has only two mps
 jabaki ensipi 25 vidhansabha siton par aage he or unke paas chaar saansad hai
 In such a situation, ncp's claim to fight both on equal seats i
e
 144 is strong
 magar ab jo halaat ban rahe hai uske anusaar congress sabhi siton par ladane ke liye taiyaar dikh rahi he
 The Congress feels that the condition of NCP in Maharashtra is bad as all important ministries like Home, Finance, PWD are with NCP and anger against their ministers may be high
 congress ke ranneetikaar yah bhi maanate hai ki siten jo bhi aaen yah acha mauka he sabhi siton par hajri lagane kaa
 Somewhere the Congress feels that after running the government continuously for 15 years, the public will rarely give this alliance a chance and thinking exactly this, NCP wants that if the bjp-shiv Sena alliance breaks, the people will get something new by forming a new alliance
 Be introduced sawaal vahi he, sabakaa apana-sapana he maharashtra kaa mukhyamantri bananaa
 The chair is one and the contenders are Uddhav Thackeray, Nitin Gadkari, Ajit Pawar and Prithviraj Chauhan

 It is noteworthy that she was killed by a female suicide bomber in Chennai

 According to Solheim, Prabhakaran wanted to take revenge for the killing of Tamils by Indian soldiers stationed in Sri Lanka during 1987–90, for which Balasingham decided to assassinate Rajiv Gandhi
 mana gaya ki agar rajeev gandhi ek baar phir satta main aate, to vah phir srilanka main sena bhej dete
 Solheim also said that Balasingham died of cancer in December 2006, but wanted to move out of the US and Europe, as his genuine affection was with India
 kitaab ke mutabik, 'saal 2006 main jivan ke antim dinon main balasingham ne apni galati (rajeev kii hatya) ke liye bharat jaakar maafee maangane kaa prayaas bhi kiya tha
 ' rajeev gandhi kii hatya ke baad littey ko pratibandhit ghoshit kar diya or prabhakaran tathaa pottu amman ko apradhi ghoshit kiya
 On the other hand, Balasingham had no qualms in admitting that the LTTE killed Tamil leader and educationist Neelam Tiruchelvam on a road in July 1999
 solhem ne kaha ki rajeev kii hatya par jab balasingham norge ke aamane-saamne hue tab unhone kaha, 'haa, hamane unhen maaraa or agar aap meri sunen, to main aapako bataaungaa ki hamane aisa kyon kiya

 Something similar happened in Delhi on Tuesday
 dilli ke jantar mantar par neshnal panther party anantnag main amarnath yatriyon par somvaar ko hue hamale ke virodh main pradarshan kar rahi thi
 Swami Om reached here without calling, accompanied by his colleague Mukesh Jain
 swami om kii chhavi aisi ban chuki he ki pradarshan ke dauraan kuchhmahilaon neswami om ko vahaan dekhakar virodh karnaa shuru kar diya
 Seeing himself surrounded, Swami Om considered it a privilege to run away
 ek mahila ne swami om ko tamaacha bhi jad diya
 This co-operative Mukesh Jain also started a scuffle while intervening with Mukesh Jain, an associate of Pitchem Swami Om
 mukesh jain ne ek mahila par bhi haath uthaaya
 This increased people's anger
 logon ne mukesh jain ko dauda-dauda kar peeta
 Meanwhile, Swami Om thought it safe to go into a corner
 lekin mahilaon samet bheed khabar lene vahaan bhi pahunch gai
 Seeing the crowd, Swami Om wanted to make the chair his shield

 The reason for this actress' problem is not being able to find a home in Mumbai
 actress ne apane dard ko fasebuk par banyaa kiya he
 He wrote that i am not able to take a house in Mumbai, it is because of my MBA
 is MBA kaa matlab muslim, bachaler, actor hone se he
 He also posted a picture of his early days
 unhone likhaa ki ye tasviir tab kii he jab main mumbai main kariyar kii shuruyaat karne ai thi
 Today nearly 8 years have passed
 maine yahaan kya paaya
 
 
 i don't deserve to get a house in Mumbai because I'm MBA - MUSLIM, BACHELOR, ACTOR
 This pic was taken when i came here with a dream of living in Mumbai and now After spending almost 8 years in this city this is what i get to hear
 
 Firstly, Yes I'm an Actor and i do not Smoke or drink and i have no criminal records
 So, how can they judge my character on the basis of my profession ?? Second, I'm a bachelor and when i call brokers they ask me higher rents for the flats which are available saying Pay extra or u won't get it since ur a Bachelor
 My question is nuisance can be created by families too??? Third, i called up another person and they ask me wether i am a Hindu or a Muslim and reverted back with an answer that Muslims are not preferred
 They also mentioned that take the flat on ur friend's name who's not a Muslim
 i mean what's in a name??? There's no difference in the blood
 Renting or buying a property in the city that never sleeps
 Mumbai which prides itself on its cosmopolitan character is divided on basis of religion, profession and marital status?? I'm shocked to see that Mumbai which has given me so much that i don't stop praising about Mumbai by calling it Aamchi Mumbai still doesn't have a place for me and so many of us coming from out of town still struggling with identity crises
 With a heavy heart and after many refusals my question is Do i belong to this city ?? 💔💔💔 # supportandsharea post shared bymirzashireen (@shireenmirza) onapr 3, 2018 at 5:32 am PDT i do not drink alcohol, do not smoke, i have no criminal record
 phir kaise duusare mere charitra ko profeshan se jaj kar sakate hai
 Secondly, when i call a broker, after my single status, he increases the rent and tells me that i will not get a house because i am not married
 jab duusare ko karo to wo ye poochta he ki main hindu hum yaa muslim
 
 
 
 aaj itane saal biit gaye hai phir bhi meraa sangharsh jari he
 i have achieved a lot here
 ant main bhavuk hokar main bas ek sawaal poochna chaahati hum ki kya main itane saal bitaane or safalataa paane ke baad bhi mumbai shahar kii rahane vaali hum, yaa nahin?bataa den ki shirina mirza star plus ke sho main negative role adaa kar raheen hai

 big bos ke ghar main rah rahe celibrity kaa asli rang ab saamne aane laga he
 On the third day of the show, Gauhar and Armaan did a lot of drama about a week's ration and food at home
 drama is kadar badha ki gauhar ro padin
 When Gauhar was crying, the wrestler Sangram reached out to wipe his tears
 tasveeron main Bigg Boss ke ghar kaa pehla dindrame se bharpoor 'big bos 7' main gharavaalon ke bich foot padani shuru ho gai he
 When the Jahnumites did not get enough food after running the cycle all night, Armaan got angry, and the pulses fell from his hand in anger
 vahiin, jab jannatavasi jahannumavaasiyon ko ghar ke ek hafte ke rashan kaa mudda samajhane aae to armaan or gauhar ke bich jhadap ho gai
 It was not yet over the drama that a new decree of Bigg Boss came, in which the Jannatvasi was given the task of standing full time and told that if they had to sit or lie down, they would have to ask the Jhanumvasis to rotate the circle
 baad main phir gauhar armaan se baat karne pahunchi or vahaan apane hi saathiyon ke liye bol baithi ki wo log andar kuch baat karte hai or baahar aakar kuch kehete hai
 Just then, what was it? Anita Advani and Tanisha came back and protested and left, but Gauhar continued her drama and got into an argument with Armaan and wept
 big bos ke controvartial gharavaalon ko hamaari muft kii salaahvahin, gauhar ko rote dekh pahwan sangram ko dukh hua or wo unke aansu ponchney ke liye pahunche

 - Anjali Damania (@anjali_damania) March 5, 2015 Earlier on Thursday, AAP leader Mayank Gandhi targeted the party's national convenor Arvind Kejriwal by writing an open letter to the activists
 gandhi ne kaaryakartaaon ke naam par khulaa khat likhakar buudhvaar ko rashtriya kaaryakarini kii baithak kaa byora bhi saarvajanik kar diya he
 According to Gandhi, 'I was told on Wednesday night that if i disclose anything, disciplinary action will be taken against me
 ab jo ho, meri pehali nishtha satya ke prati he
 Here are the facts of the meeting about the dismissal of Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan
 main rashtriya kaaryakarini se nivedan karuunga ki meeting ke minutes relies kiye jaaen
 'gandhi wrote,' On the night of 26 February, when members of the National Executive wanted to meet Arvind Kejriwal, Arvind gave the message that if these two members remain in the PAC, they will not be able to act as convenors
 4 march ko hui rashtriya kaaryakarini kii baithak kii yahi prishthbhumi thi
 'gandhi told,' During the Delhi election campaign, Prashant Bhushan had threatened several times that he would hold a press conference against the party as he had some objections on the selection of candidates
 hamamen se kuch log kisi tarah unhen chunaav tak shant rakhane main safal rahe
 It was alleged that Yogendra Yadav was conspiring against Arvind Kejriwal and some evidence was also presented
 arvind kejariwal or prashanth bhushan, yogendra yadav ke bich kabhi na mitane vaale matbhed ho chuke the
 The trust between them was also very low
 'bataur gandhi, 'yogendra yadav ne kaha ki wo samaj sakate hai ki arvind unhen PAC main nahin dekhnaa chaahate, ek saath kaam karnaa mushkil he isliye wo or prashanth pacse baahar rahenge lekin unhen baahar nahin kiya janaa chahie
 He introduced two formulas
 -PAC kaa punargathan ho or nae sadsy chune jaaen
 Prashant Bhushan and Yogendra Yadav will not present their candidature in the PAC elections
 -PAC apane vartmaan rup main hi kaam karti rahe or yogendra yadav or prashanth bhushan kisi bhi meeting main hissaa nahin lenge
 Mayank Gandhi did not participate in the PAC voting on Wednesday and he has given the reason for this in his open letter
 unhone likhaa, 'arvind ko PAC main achche se kaam karne kii jarurat he
 So i agree that Prashant Bhushan and Yogendra Yadav can stay out of the PAC and take some other important roles
 main unhen saarvajanik rup se baahar rakhane ke prastaav ke virodh main tha or khaskar tab, jab ve khud hatane ko taiyaar the
 This decision to remove them was against the sentiments of activists around the world
 main is baat se sahamat tha ki wo PAC se baahar ja sakate hai, lekin iske peeche kii bhaavana or tarika mujhe sweekaarya nahin tha
 So i decided to be non-spot

 deraa sachcha sauda pramukh gurmeet rahim ke anuyaayiyon ke utpaat ke baad ek baar ye sawaal uthne laga he ki unke paas hathiyaar kahaan se aae or kya unhen isaki training di gai
 This question is also being raised because in 2010 the army intelligence team had expressed its apprehension
 angreji akhbaar times of india ke mutabik, disambar 2010 main sirsa ke deraa mukhyalay main bhakton ko hathiyaaron kii training dene kii baat saamne ai thi
 Army Intelligence had feared this
 khufia team ne kaha tha ki training ke liye purv sainikon kaa istemaal hone kii ashanka jataai thi
 Following this information, advisory was also issued to the army personnel
 unhen aisi koi bhi training na dene kii taakid kii gai thi
 Police did not find evidence, however, after this information, police searched the Dera headquarters
 magar police ko hathiyaaron kii training ke sambandh main saboot nahin mili
 After the violence, arms were recovered and his devotees created a ruckus in Panchkula after Gurmeet was convicted on charges of rape
 aagjanee or todphod kii
 After this, the police-administration conducted a search operation in many areas
 police ko ek AK-47 or ek moujar baraamad hua
 Also two rifles and 5 pistols were recovered from a vehicle
 2014 main bhi uthaa tha mudda2014 main hisar main sant rampal ke samarthakon ne surakshabalon ke saath khooni sangharsh kiya
 In protest of Rampal's arrest, his devotees attacked the media with the police
 bhakton ne hathiyaaron kaa bhi istemaal kiya
 The Punjab and Haryana High Court took cognizance of this incident on its own
 vahiin duusari haryana sarkaar ne 2015 main court main deraa mukhyalay ko jawaab daakhil kiya
 While giving a clean chit to the dera, the government told the court that the investigation did not reveal arms training or keeping arms in the Dera headquarters

 haalanki hawa kaa pattern change hone kii vajah se tej thandi hawaaen chal sakati hai
 So far this year, compared to last year, the weather department has not received any significant signs of severe cold, so will have to wait for that Delhi cold
 loksabhaa chunaav main mili haar ke baad basapa supremeo mayawati jis tarah samaajawaadee party or uske adhyaksh akhilesh yadav par ek ke baad ek hamale kar rahi hai, usase sapa khemaa bhadkaa hua he
 Akhilesh has prevented the party leaders from making any rhetoric on the issue, due to which the SP leaders are forced to press their anger against BSP and Mayawati but also prepared the blue print to avenge the deception met inside Is going
 koshish maaya ke vot bank main sendhamari kii he, jise akhilesh yadav sampark or samvaad ke formule se anjaam dena chaahate hai
 Mayawati has been the biggest beneficiary of the SP-BSP alliance in Uttar Pradesh
 basapa pradesh main jiro se 10 siton par pahunch gai or uskaa votbank bhi pichley chunaav kii tarah jas kaa tas bana rahaa
 At the same time, Akhilesh Yadav looted his political deposits in the alliance
 unke vot teen fisadi tak ghat gaye
 The party won five seats as in the previous election, but lost its own stronghold Dimple Yadav in Kannauj, Dharmendra Yadav in Badaun and Akshay Yadav in Firozabad
 mayawati ke aaropon par sapa ke mukhya pravaktaa rajendra choudhary kehete hai ki akhilesh yadav kaa charitra kisi ko dhokhaa dene vaala nahin he
 In the Lok Sabha elections, SP has sincerely practiced coalition religion
 iske baavjood mayawati ne samaajawaadee party se gathbandhan tod diya or upachunaav main akele ladane kaa elaan kiya he
 Akhilesh Yadav is silent on Mayawati's constant attacks
 sapa netaaon ko is khamoshi main hi phayda dikh rahaa he
 a senior SP leader, on the condition of anonymity, said that even if the party can retaliate to Mayawati's allegations, it will worsen the situation, because the SP-BSP alliance was not just a coalition of two parties but also the Dalit- The Yadav community had a grassroots alliance
 sapa ko lagata he ki mayawati dwaara gathbandhan tode jane se daliton or pichhadon ko takalif hui he
 Apart from this, the fight for social justice has also been weakened by the breaking of the coalition
 aise main daliton ke padhe likhe tabake main akhilesh yadav ko lekar sahanubhuti he
 Apart from the way Mayawati has entrusted her political legacy to brother Anand Kumar and nephew Akash, a section of Dalits will also be upset with the BSP
 sapa kii najar inhen tabakon par he
 Not only this, after the Lok Sabha elections, there have been many cases of Dalit oppression in UP
 pratapgarh main dabangon ne ek dalit kii jhopadi main aag lagaakar use maar diya to unnav main ek dalit ladki ke saath balaatkaar kii ghatana hui
 Mayawati remained silent on both these matters, while Akhilesh Yadav asked a team of SP leaders to prepare a report
 sapa kii najar apane khiske janaadhar ko waapas laane ke saath-saath mayawati ke dalit votbank par bhi he
 SP has made a strategy to connect the Pasi community among the Dalits
 iske liye party basapa se aae indrajit saroj samet tamaam dalit netaaon ko aage badhayegi or apane janaadhar ko majboot karegi
 Akhilesh Yadav last visited all the districts of UP in the 2012 assembly elections
 lekin mukhyamantri banane ke baad ye silsilaa khatm ho gaya tha
 The SP leader said that after the end of the Parliament session, Akhilesh Yadav will again visit all the districts of Uttar Pradesh
 is daure ke jariye akhilesh logon se sampark or samvaad sthapit karenge
 He will make the people aware of the party's policies and will get down to fight on the road with the party workers regarding their problems
 sapa ne apane netaa, padaadhikari, jila, booth or gaanv str ke kaaryakartaaon ko nirdesh diya he ki wo janata ke bich jaaen
 Party workers have been asked to reach out to all sections of society, especially the weaker sections

 This news has been given by an English newspaper
 congress ke do varisht netaaon ne bataaya ki rahul party adhyaksh kaa pad march yaa april main le lenge
 According to the newspaper's news, both these leaders are close to the Gandhi family
 samajha jaataa he ki ye donon party ke dhaanche ko nayaa swaroop dene main lage hue the
 According to him, the party leadership is considering two possible times for Rahul Gandhi to take over as president
 aisa yaa to march-april main hoga, jab eisisi kaa vishesh satr bulaayaa jayega or vahaan party kaa nayaa agenda or bhavishya kii ruparekha tay kii jaaegi
 If it is not done at that time then it will be in the party's general session which will be in July or August
 congress kii yojana he ki jab narendra modi sarkaar apane ek saal puure kar le to hi congress main badlaav ho or rahula gandhi aakraamak tareeke se apana kaam shuru kar saken
 Party sources say that the time has come for Rahul Gandhi to take over the chair of the president
 ek varisht netaa ne akhbaar ko bataaya ki party ke 130 wein saal main ek nayaa netaa aayega
 In a party meeting, the idea was that the 45-year-old Rahul Gandhi be given the full command of the party

 Action has been taken to cancel the lease of 135 hectares (150 bighas approx)
 patta radd kiye jane kii karrwai esadm sadar court se kii gai he
 In relation to this, Government Advocate Ajay Tiwari said that this land was leased by the Government to Mohammad Jauhar Ali Trust Joint Secretary Nasir Khan on 24 June 2013 under the Government Grant Act
 yah patta 30 saal ke liye hua tha jabaki is jameen kii mul shrenee ret main darj thi
 Since the sand should not have been leased, then it was done

 Now the Sub Divisional Officer, Sadar, ordered the registration of this land in the original category ie sand
 jiske chalate yah patta nirast kar diya gaya he or jameen ko mul shrenee ret main darj karne ke aadesh kiye gaye hai
 Actually, during the SP government in Uttar Pradesh, in the year 2013, Azam Khan changed the land use of that land and included it in the land to be given government grant
 ab sarkaar badalane se jab ajam khan ke khilaaf tamaam tarah kii jaanch padtaal shuru hui to rajasav vibhaag ne isaki bhi jaanch kar iske bhu upyog ke badalane ko gaiyr kanoonee bataaya he or kaha he ki nadi ke kinare ret kii jameen patte par dena gaiyr kanoonee he
 Therefore, its lease is canceled

 With the passage of time, the ISIS terrorist organization of Baghdadi is becoming more and more unbridled and dangerous

 Because even today there are no such areas in Iraq and Syria where there are dead bodies everywhere but there is no one to reach there 
 or isi kadi me bagdadi ne ab sir kalam karne ke video ke baad iraqi fouj ko goliyon se udaane kaa nayaa video jari kiya he
 This video came out four days ago via social media
 yani 29 oktober ko
 In this video, the Iraqi soldier is seen sitting on his knees in his military uniform
 uske donon haath peeche kii ore bandhe hue hai, pairon main juuton ke bajaay chappalein hai or uske cheharaa dhundhala kar rakhaa he
 a man with a gun is also seen standing behind that soldier
 maut ke saaye main baitha ye sainik aakhri baar apane khuda se dua maang rahaa he
 As soon as his blessings end and Akbar comes out of his mouth, suddenly two terrorists close to his head bring their guns to their mouths and in the blink of an eye several bullets come out to haunt the world
 And creepy face
 ji haa
 ISIS militants have now started merciless death on civilians from other countries as well as Iraq's hostages
 ghutanon ke bal baitha ye wo iraqi sena kaa wo faujee he jo sunni aatankiyon ke khilaaf chhidi jang main iesas aatankiyon ke hathe chadh gaya or use isi tarah maut ke ghat utaar diya gaya
 And surprisingly, now the terrorists have started showing the world the video of killing soldiers or Iraqi civilians
 garaj ye ki arab ke registan ko khun le laal karne nikle iesas ke aatanki aisi khaufnak tasveeron ke jariye ankhon se utarkar duniya ke dilon main dehshat banane kaa nayaa tamaasha shuru kar diya he
 More than 85 Kurdish civilians were killed in a week, and the Iraqi military was gunned down in front of a camera and was not alone
 balki ye to bas ek baangi he iesas ke aatankiyon kii, jise un logon ne soshal media ke jariye duniya ke saamne rakhaa he
 If the scattered news from Arabia is to be believed, the ISIS terrorists have killed more than 85 people in the same way since last Saturday and then their bodies were opened to become eagles of eagles and ravens
 Scattered in the desert
 maare gaye zyaadaatar log iraq kii kurd janajati se taalluk rakhte hai or ye maut kaa khooni khel shanivaar kii subah uttari ramaadi ke raas al maa ke viraane main kahin anjaam diya gaya
 It is being told that so far more than 300 people of this caste have been killed and that too within a few days
 'goli maaro yaa goli khao'is tarah kaa khun kharaba karne ke peeche iesas kaa bas ek hi makasad he
 That is, in the far-flung parts of Iraq, which it has to confront the common people
 iraqi logon kii bandooken aatankiyon kii rukaawat ban rahi thim
 It is necessary to remove them from the path, however
 ye taaja tasviir gavaah he ki iraqi logon ke saamne ab do hi raste bache hai
 Either, let the terrorists target your bullet
 yaa khud is tarah se aakhri dua ke saath unki goli kaa nishaanaa ban jaaen
 Baghdadi ISIAS fighters, using social media, have captured several cities in Iraq and Syria and are committing massacres in many cities

 And Baghdadi has made social media a weapon for this work
 wo soshal media ke jariye duniyabar ke naujavaanon tak pahunch rahaa he or unka brain wash kar rahaa he
 Till now the dead bodies of humans were being found on the scorching sands of the desert areas of Iraq and Syria
 iraq ke kisi bhi gaanv yaa shahar ke kisi bhi chalate hue raste par insaani laashon kaa milanaa rosemara kii baat ban gai thi
 Human corpses riddled with bullets lying in the open plains had become an uncontrolled chain in Iraq
 lekin ab yahaan kuen se laashen nikal rahi hai
 After five months of ongoing massacres, the people of Iraq are now seeing the dreadful appearance of death from those wells
 jin kuon main insaan ko jindagi dene vaala pani maujuud rahata tha or kuen se nikali laashon kii jab ginati hui to usne 50 kaa aankada paar kar liya
 Most of the dead bodies were women and children
 unki shinaakht iraq ke al bu nimr kabeeley ke laapata logon ke taur par hui

 al bu nimr kabeeley ke logon kaa qatleamaye 50 un 65 logon main se hi hai jo pichley ek hafte se laapata the
 It was also feared that the people of this clan have been abducted by ISIS
 iraq kaa sarkari aankada gavaah he ki bagdadi ke aatanki ab tak is kabila jati ke teen sau se zyada logon ko maut ke ghat utaar chuke hai
 Not only this, the terrorists have captured the people of this clan and looted all the ammunition that they had

 More than 15,000 people have fled their own countries to be a part of this war and have reached the areas of Iraq and Syria where the IS fighters are making a killing
 aies ne duniya bhar ke naujavaanon ko dehshat kii fouj main shaamil hone kaa rasta kholaa he or wo bhi soshal media ke jariye
 There is also a disclosure of the report that the number of foreign youth who have joined this organization during the last two years, and never in any organization
 iraq or syria ke jis hisse main sena or aatankiyon ke bich ghamaasan machaa hua he
 Such pictures are often seen with flags and posters

 team india ke captain mahendra singh dhoni ne apane saathi khilaadiyon se srilanka ke khilaaf trikoniya ekadivasiy shrinkhalaa ke final ke parinaam ko lekar chintit hone ke bajaay keval basics par dhyaan dene kii salaah di he
 India defeated Sri Lanka in the final of the Asia Cup in June and Dhoni's team will try to continue this victory campaign

 He said, "I believe that small things matter a lot
" yadi aap choti chizon kaa khyaal rakhte ho, to badi chizon main khud hi sudhaar ho jaataa he, isliye hamen choti chizon kaa khyaal rakhane or basics ke hisaab se chalane kii jarurat he
 "it will depend on whether you bat first or bowling," he said
 yadi ham pehle gendbaaji karte hai, to paristhitiyon kaa phayda uthaane kii koshish karenge
 There is strong wind on this ground and bowlers can take the help of him and take the wicket and cover the rival team on a low score
 ’’ dhoni ne kaha, ‘‘ kshetrarakshan mahatvapurn hoga, kyonki virdohi team ke prayek das ran aakhir main kaaphi mahatvapurn honge

 He said, "we would like to avoid disputes as much as possible
" bich main hamane dekha ki kisi ballebaaj par jurmaana lag gaya
 Sometimes a captain gets fined for slow over rate
 aapako iske saath aage badhanaa hota he
 Hope there will be no further controversy, although we will play a tough game to get a grip on the match
 ’’dhoni ne kaha, ‘‘ hamaara majboot paksh maidan par utarkar jubaani jang ladanaa nahin he
 We are a team that encourages the bowler, but at the same time does not show a very friendly attitude with the batsman, so we will keep distance from the opponent batsman
 ’’ballebaajon ke lachar pradarshan par unhone kaha, ‘‘ haa yah badi chintaa he, lekin aashaa he ki kal ham acha pradarshan karenge
 We have to make a score which bowlers can defend
 hamane yah score kaise hasil kiya
 It does not matter that someone played a good innings and we managed to score 220 or 240 runs

 It is difficult to tell how much Mahi likes Bonds like you and us, but Mahi believes strongly in number 7 just like Bond does
 7 number ko apane liye shubh maanate hai or apni nijee jindagi main is number ko puri ahmiyat dete hai
 The comments kai log maanate hai ki maahi kii is safalataa kaa raaj chupa he number 7 main
 Dhoni's date of birth is 07−07−81
 
 
 is tarikh main har jagah 7 he


maheene kaa saatvaan, din saal kaa saatvaan maheenaa or saal 81 yani 8−1 7
 Dhoni was married on 04−07−2010, of which 7 are also hidden
 saal ke saatven maheene, tarikh or saal kaa jod bhi 7 banataa he
 Dhoni wears a number 7 jersey, whether it is an ODI or a T-20 match
 pichley saal kai badi companiyon se qaraar bhi dhoni ne 7 ko dhyaan main rakhte hue hi kiya
 There is definitely a number 7 in Dhoni's car and bike too
 7 number kii is theory ko bal is baat se bhi miltaa he ki dhoni ne apane cricketting kariyar ke saatven saal main world cap jitkar vah karnama kar diya, jo pichley 28 saal se koi captain nahin kar paaya tha
 Many believe that the secret of this success of Mahi is hidden in number 7
 dhoni kaa date of berth he 07−07−81

 dhoni 7 number kii jersey pahante he, chaahe vah vanade ho yaa koi tii−20 match
 Last year, Dhoni also signed agreements with many big companies keeping 7 in mind
 dhoni kii gaadi or bike main bhi kisi na kisi tarah number 7 jarur hota he
 The strength of this number 7 theory also comes from the fact that Dhoni won the World Cup in the seventh year of his cricketing career, which he had not been able to captain for the last 28 years

 Now there are no differences between me and the Muslim brothers
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki ab yah rajya sarkaar kii jimmedaari he ki vah sunishchit kare ki kisi kaa bhi nussaan na ho
 The comments lekin iske baavjood 'vishvarupam' tamilnadu main release nahin kii jaaegi, kyonki madras hoicourt kii single-jaj bench dwaara mangalvaar ko die gaye pratibandh hataa dene ke faisle ko rajya sarkaar kii apil par badi bench ne palat diya he

 world cap 2015 newjiland or australia kii mejabani main hona he
 In such a situation, the importance of fast bowlers increases for every team
 newjiland or australia kii tej pichon par khitaab bachaane ke liye team india ko pes atake par khaas dhyaan dena hoga
 On Thursday, 30 potential players of Team India were shortlisted for the Mahakumbh of cricket and eight fast bowlers have been included in it
 eshanth sharma, bhubaneshwar kumaar, mohammad shami, umesh yadav, varun aron, dhaval kulkarni, mohit sharma or ashok dinda, in aathon main se paanch gendbaajon ke 15 sadasyeey team main shaamil hone kii sambhaavna he
 The list of the 15-member team for the World Cup will be released on 7 January
 parformens or experience kii baat karen to eshanth, bhuvi, shami, umesh or varun kaa world cap tikat katnaa lagbhag tay dikh rahaa he
 At the same time, Dhawal, Mohit and Dinda may face disappointment after making a place in the probables
 dilachasp baat ye he ki sambhaviton main shaamil kisi bhi tej gendbaaj ko world cap main khilne kaa koi anubhav nahin he
 Now let's take a look at these five bowlers, who will bear the heavy responsibility of saving the title of Team India
 eshanth sharmahbharat kii ore se eshanth pes atake main sabase anbhavi gendbaaj honge
 Ishant has 31 in 75 odis
 25 ke ausat se 106 wicket jatke hai
 During this period, four wickets for 34 runs has been their best performance
 australian pichon par eshanth ne 9 match khele or 20
 14 wickets at an average of 42
 unka best parformens bhi australian sarajameen par hi he
 Not only this, Ishant has just 4 on Australian pitches
 60 ke iconmi rate se ran kharche hai, jabaki overol unka iconmi rate 5
 It is 69
 newjiland main eshanth ne mahaj 4 match khele hai or is dauraan unka pradarshan kuch khaas nahin rahaa he
 He scored 47 on Kiwi pitches
 60 kii ausat se 5 wicket jatke hai
 Team India would definitely like to take advantage of Ishant's experience
 bhubaneshwar kumarapichley kuch samay main bhuvi ne team main apni majboot jagah bana lee he
 The bowler was also given the 2014 ICC People's Choice Award
 42 vanade maichon main bhuvi ne 36
 He has 44 wickets at an average of 59 and during this time his economy rate is 4
 60 kaa rahaa he
 Best bowling performance Bhuvi has four wickets for 8 runs
 bhuvi gendbaaji ke alaava nichle kram main acchhee ballebaaji bhi kar sakate hai, jiskaa namoona wo england daure par dikhaa chuke hai
 Bhuvi has not played in Australia yet but he will get experience of playing on Australian pitches on the current tour of India
 newjiland kii pichon par unka pradarshan kuch khaas nahin rahaa or 5 match main wo mahaj 4 wicket jhatak sake
 Their economy rate 5 there
 43 kaa tha
 Bhuvi may not have the speed but the variation and swing is his USP
 mohammad shamibhuvaneshwar kii tarah mohammad shami ne bhi team india main majboot jagah bana lee he
 Shami made 26 in 36 odis
 08 ke ausat se 68 wicket jatke hai, jabaki unka iconmi rate 5
 Has been 74
 shami kaa best parformens 36 ran kharchakar chaar wicket he
 Shami has not played any international match in Australia yet but he will get experience from this on the current tour
 vahiin newjiland pichon par shami bhale hi mahange sabit hue hon lekin unhone wicket bhi jatke
 Shami played 5 odis and 28 in New Zealand
 72 kii ausat se 11 wicket jatke
 During this, his economy rate was 7
 18 kaa rahaa
 The plus point with Shami too is that he can add some runs despite being a tailor
 shami dhimi gendbaaji karte hai lekin gend ko achche se move kara lete hai
 Good line and length is Shami's USP
 umesh yadavanujiland or australian pichon par umesh apni raftaar se kaamyaab sabit ho sakate hai
 Umesh Yadav throws the ball at a fast pace and also maintains the line and length
 umesh ko 38 vanade maichon kaa experience he
 During this he 36
 5 ke ausat or 5
 There are 47 wickets at an economy rate of 89
 umesh australia main pehle bhi khel chuke hai
 Umesh has played 6 matches and 59 on Australian pitches
 80 kii ausat se 5 wicket jatke hai
 Umesh Yadav's performance in the tri-series against Sri Lanka and the hosts in 2012 may not have been very strong, but in two years this bowler has come into the fold
 raftaar ke saath line or length par niyantran rakhana kaaphi had tak umesh ne siikhaa he
 Varun Aaron: Aaron is the fastest bowler in Team India in current times
 eron ko mahaj 9 vanade international maichon kaa anubhav he is dauraan unka pradarshan mila-jula rahaa he
 Aaron bowled well in the practice matches in Australia and if this performance continues in the Test and tri-odi series, then he is almost certain to play in the World Cup
 eron ne 9 maichon main 38
 He has 11 wickets at an average of 09, during which his economy rate is 6
 61 kaa rahaa he
 The biggest problem for Aaron is that he is unable to control the line length with speed and pays the run cost
 newjiland main eron 3 match khel chuke hai is dauraan unhone 7
 Economy rate of 03 and 40
 75 kii ausat se chaar wicket jatke
 If Aaron learns to control line length with speed, then his place will also be confirmed in the team
 plaing ilevan kaa ye hoga funda!world cap ke maichon main team india teen tej gendbaajon ke combination ke saath utar sakati he
 While one spinner and one all-rounder will complete the remaining 20 overs
 iske alaava agar team chaar gendbaajon ke saath utarati he to bhi aashcharya nahin hoga
 In the 3 + 1 formula, playing Bhuvi and Shami is almost certain, while Ishant and Umesh as a third bowler may have a tough fight

 lekin is saal china ko alag hanger diya gaya he
 However, apart from China, some other exhibitors are also present in this hangar

 It is a different matter that China has come to the trade fair this year with more technology than its products
 isliye china ke stall beshak zyada hai lekin kharidari karne vaale log china se khush nahin hai
 According to the people coming here, there is nothing like boycotting Chinese goods
 lekin china is baar kuch khaas laayaa hi nahin jise kharida jaae
 All the stalls are technical, so there are still some options for the traders, but nothing special for the common buyers

 Like when your friendly behavior has been taken as an expression of sex desire? An interesting study has shown that while most women believe that fellow men take their friendly behavior as a sign of sex, men believe that women often perceive men's sexual desire as friendliness
 norge science and technological uniwarsity (antianyu) ke research mons bendixen ne kaha he ki agar vikaas ke nazariye se dekha jaae to research ke faisle chaunkaane vaale nahin hai
 The research team conducted the study with 308 participants, aged between 18 and 30 years
 unamem main 59 fisadi mahilaayein thim
 According to research, men and women found that their opposite-sex peers misinterpreted their friendship
 research megsine 'evolutionari psychology' main prakashit research ke mutabik mahila pratibhaagiyon ne kaha ki unhone jab apane kisi purush saathi ke liye mithravat vyavhaar dikhaaya to pichley ek saal ke dauraan takreeban 3
 5 times he was interpreted to mean sex
 purushon ne bhi saathi mahilaon se isi tarah kii pareshaani jaahir kii, haalanki purushon ke maamle main iskaa pratishat kam rahaa
 According to the researcher, if viewed from the perspective of evolutionary psychology, it can be better understood that why men often take to smiling and laughing in conversation with female partners as expressing their desire for sex
 bendixen ise spasht karte hai ki ek purush kii santanotpatti kii kshamta is baat par nirbhar karti he ki vah kitni mahilaon ko garbhvatee karne kii kshamta rakhata he
 In this way, the case of sex for men becomes far less risky and sex with a woman is like an opportunity for her
 lekin mahilaon ke maamle main aisa nahin he
 This type of relationship is more risky for women, as they may be at risk of becoming pregnant, bearing a child, raising them and also reducing the chance of having a child by having sex with another male

 ---input IANS se In this press conference, when a journalist asked that when you have the real checks, then how does it prove that the Aam Aadmi Party has taken these money, then you MLA Devinder Sehrawat said that "we are not saying that they took money We are saying that we have kept all this as evidence among the public
 ab agenciyaan isaki jaanch karen
 "but when NDTV India spoke to Neil Haslam on Tuesday morning, Neil may have forgotten his own point
 ab unka kahana he, aam aadmi party ke andar se kisi ne unako ye check die, haalanki unhone ye mana ki do check vahi hai, jo unhone disambar main jari kiye the, lekin ye check dene vaali company koun hai inkaa pataa lagane kii baat unhone kahi, jabaki kapil mishra ne kaha ki ye do check unheen companiyon ke hai jinhone aadhi raat ko aam aadmi party 50 lakh rupee kaa chanda diya tha
 Obviously it is not clear who issued these checks in the name of Aam Aadmi Party and how they got their hands
 aam aadmi party bhi saafe nahin bataa rahi ki uskaa in check dene vaali companiyon se lenaa dena he yaa nahin? aam aadmi party netaa dilip pandey ne kaha -aapaki koi bhi company hogi aap chanda dijiye ham lenge, rahi baat in check or companiyon kii to unheen se puuchhie naa jo laae hai farzi check
 The comments ye do check kate to aam aadmi party ke naam par hai, lekin inako raajnneetik rup se cash kapil mishra or unke sahyogi karvaa rahe hai, kyonki na check jari karne vaali companiyon kaa koi ata-pataa he or naa is baat kaa koi sidhaa jawaab mil paa rahaa he ki 'aap' ke naam par kataa check kapil mishra or unke sahyogiyon ke haath kaise lag gaya? Obviously it is not clear who issued these checks in the name of Aam Aadmi Party and how they got their hands
 aam aadmi party bhi saafe nahin bataa rahi ki uskaa in check dene vaali companiyon se lenaa dena he yaa nahin? aam aadmi party netaa dilip pandey ne kaha -aapaki koi bhi company hogi aap chanda dijiye ham lenge, rahi baat in check or companiyon kii to unheen se puuchhie naa jo laae hai farzi check
 The comments ye do check kate to aam aadmi party ke naam par hai, lekin inako raajnneetik rup se cash kapil mishra or unke sahyogi karvaa rahe hai, kyonki na check jari karne vaali companiyon kaa koi ata-pataa he or naa is baat kaa koi sidhaa jawaab mil paa rahaa he ki 'aap' ke naam par kataa check kapil mishra or unke sahyogiyon ke haath kaise lag gaya? These two checks are deducted in the name of the Aam Aadmi Party, but they are being made cash politically by Kapil Mishra and his associates, because neither the companies issuing the checks have any knowledge and there is no direct answer to this
 How is it that the chopped check in the name of 'AAP' caught the hands of Kapil Mishra and his associates? nagar nigam ke purv ayukta ko tehraaya jimmedaarkharab kaaryastylee kii vajah se jalajmav kii sthitirajdhani patna main pichley 1 saptaah se barish kii vajah se hue jalajmav kii sthiti ke liye nagar vikaas mantri suresh sharma ne nagar nigam ke purv ayukta ko jimmedaar tehra diya he

 sharma ne kaha ki rajya sarkaarpatna waalon kii museebatko lekar kaaphi sanjeeda he or isi ko lekar vah sabhi ilaakon se jald se jald pani kii nikasi ke prayaas kar rahe hai
 However, when talking to Aaj Tak, Suresh Sharma refused to apologize when Suresh Sharma was asked if he would apologize to Patna people for the trouble they had caused
 suresh sharma ne kaha ki unhen is baat kaa dukh tha ki patna vaasiyon ko jalajmav kii sthiti kii vajah se kaaphi pareshaani kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he or sarkaar musiibat se nikaalane ke liye prayasarat he magar unhone maafee maangane se inkaar kar diya

 Gmail is the most used email service in the world
 google ne jimail web main bada badlaav kiya he
 We have already told you about the report of its design changes
 ab aadhikarik taur par company ne nayaa jimail interphes jari kar diya he jise yuj kiya ja saktaa he
 Google is releasing new Gmail to users across the world
 nae dizin main vijual badlaav ke saath fitures main bhi badlaav kiye gaye hai saath kii kuch fitures jode bhi gaye hai
 However Google has said that together this feature 1 of the world
 4 billian yugers ko nahin milenge balki charnon main die jaaenge
 Initially, users will be given an additional option to use the new Gmail
 yani agar chahen to yuj karen chahen to nahin yuj karen
 Google has said that the new design of Gmail has been made keeping in mind the people to be safer and more productive
 Confidential Modenae jimail main yah mod diya gaya he
 Under this, the sender can set an expirydate by sending a sensitive email so that the email can be withdrawn completely
 darasal iske liye google samvedansheel contant ko sidhe na bhej kar is contant kaa link bhejtaa he jise resiver jimail ke jariye open kar saktaa he
 In this, the sender has the right to withdraw mail at any time
 email snoojing / smart riplijimail is nae feechar ko apane plateform par laayaa he
 Smart reply was already given on the mobile app, now you will be given the same feature on Gmail web
 vijual apadet kii baat karen to yahaan sabase bada badlaav ye he ki dayee taraf ab aapako said panel dikhegaa
 It will have tools like Calendar, Google Keep and Google Tasks which you can use from here
 yahaan se meeting organij karnaa, de plan karnaa aasaan hoga
 Offline Mode: In Gmail web too, offline mode is now supported
 yani internet na hone kii sthiti main bhi aapako vaisaa hi jimail yujar interphes milegaa jaisaa online hota he
 That is, even if the internet has gone, you can still work on Gmail's user interface and any changes you make will be synchronized so that the next time you are online, you can be given this
 praathamikta ke aadhaar par notificationgoogle ne jimail ke liye hai pryority notification feechar bhi jari kiya he
 This is expected to reduce mobile notifications

 Google says that this will reduce push notifications for Gmail users by up to 97 percent
 security feechargoogle ne nae jimail ko fishing se bachaane ke liye email warning system bhi laayaa he
 If you are potentially bothered by an email, the red, yellow and gray color in the top of the email will tell you how much the risk is
 haalanki yah feechar pehle bhi tha, lekin google ne kaha he ki top par die gaye is feechar se sambhavit khataron se yugers bachenge
 How and when you will be able to use it? Some of these features have come, while Confidential mode will come in the coming weeks

 shanivaar, 23 farvari ko rajdhani dilli ke 35, sardaar patel maarg par sthit intelligence beuro ke mukhyalay main aalaa adhikari 84 inch ke tivi screen par kuch dhundhlee tasviren dekh rahe the
 They were trying to identify the suspects in CCTV footage of the Hyderabad blast site two days ago
 dhamaakon main 16 logon kii maut ho gai or 156 log ghayal ho gaye
 Officers carefully looked at the picture of a person riding a bicycle
 uski cycle ke karier par ek dibba rakhaa hua tha
 An officer said, "that's it
" isi ne bam rakhaa he
 Comparing that person to a large picture of 30-year-old Yasin Bhatkal, the head of the Indian Mujahideen, another officer said, "he looks like Yasin Bhatkal
" ’’ lekin tabhi tisare adhikari ne saare utsaah par yah kehete hue pani pher diya, ‘‘screen par dikh rahi cycle main ghanti lagi he jabaki dhamaake main istemaal kii gai cycle bagaiyr ghanti kii thi
 The footage was part of a 60-hour recording that investigators received from CCTV cameras in the Dilsukhnagar area targeted by terrorists
 dhundhale se hi ek anya shot main ek cycle ke najadik teen sandigdh log dikh rahe the
 The Andhra Pradesh Police and the National Investigation Agency (NIA) are also investigating these footage
 lekin zyaadaatar footage behad dhundhale hai
 The IB has failed to stop the terrorist attacks
 aisa isliye kyonki uske paas aisi koi thos jaankaree nahin hoti jiske bal par koi kadam uthaaya jaae, or phir vah jaanchakartaaon ko khufia jaankaree samajhane main bhi naakaam rahata he
 That too despite the fact that information from various agencies and states is stored in the ib's Multi Agency Center (MAC)
 emesi se ummid kii jaati he ki vah sambandhit rajyon ko ‘alert’ ke rup main jaankaree uplabdh karaayega
 This information is sometimes accurate
 aapasi ladaai main uljhe26 / 11 ko mumbai main hue hamale ke baad tatkaaleen grih mantri pi
 MAC was formed by Chidambaram
 unhone neshnal counter terrerism centre (ensitisi) or neshnal intelligence grid (natgrid) banane kii bhi koshish kii thi taaki desh kii alag-alag databes se praapt jaankaree ko ek jagah ikattha kiya ja sake
 But the NCTC is now caught in a fight between the Center and the states
 darasal, ibi swatantra ensitisi nahin chahta he jabaki rajya nahin chaahate ki ensitisi ibi ke antargat kaam kare
 At the same time, Natgrid has not even started working due to red tape
 america 9 / 11 (2001) ko apane yahaan hue hamale or britain 7 / 7 (2005) ke baad sabhi bade hamalon ko roak paane main safal rahe hai, vahiin bharat kaa buree tarah se bikharaa hua khufia tantra ab tak aapas main jujh rahaa he
 The US has not only strengthened the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), but has also formed the NCTC to unite and deal with terror
 epabiai bharat ke ibi or sibiai ke mail kii tarah he
 The IB also has its own problems
 uske paas jamini str par kaam karne ke liye kaaphi kam log (oparative) hai
 Those working for IB also lack the necessary training and techniques to understand the information
 agency rajyon ko jitne bhi alert jari karti he, kisi se bhi sthaan yaa samay vishesh kii jaankaree nahin mil paati he
 In such a situation, all these alerts fall under the category of 'not actionable'
 us par, rajyon kii police ibi ke in alert ko zyada gambhirtha se nahin leti kyonki unhen har din is tarah ke lagbhag 250 alert milte hai
 There is no explanation with the Shakespeare Sarani police station in Kolkata as to why he left Yasin Bhatkal, who was arrested in a theft case in December 2009
 yaccin police ko yah bharosa dilaane main kaamyaab ho gaya ki vah ‘number 9 north range, kolkata-17’ ke nivasee karthik mallik kaa betaa bulla mallik he
 And the police also believed him because they had no photographs of the most wanted terrorist of India and the prime accused in the August 2007 bomb blasts in Hyderabad and the September 2008 blasts
 aisa isliye kyonki ibi ne yaccin or iem ke sah-sansthaapak ikbaal or riyaj bhatkal kii tasveeron ko sirf unheen khufia agenciyon ke saath saz kiya tha, jo emesi kaa hissaa hai
 Ideally, the IB would have shared these photographs with the state units of the MAC, then these units would have taken the photographs to the district and local police stations
 lekin aisa nahin kiya gaya, jo khufia chen main daraar kii tarah he
 The Bhatkal brothers have been behind the terrorist attacks in the country since 2007, but they are still far from the reach of the IB
 iem kii jad bharat main hi he, iskaa gathan yaheen hua he or pakistan ke lashkar-e-taiyaba se iskaa sambandh bahut zyada nahin he
 IM gets money from ISI for carrying out terrorist activities
 bharat main simi par pratibandh lagane ke baad uske kai kaaryakartaaon ko iem ne apane saath shaamil kar liya
 It is believed that IM uses local and one-member sleeper cells to carry out terrorist incidents
 ibi kaa kahana he ki is sanghathan main send maarna uske liye mushkil he kyonki isamen akele log kaam ko anjaam dete hai or phir se apni rosemara kii jindagi main laut jate hai
 In the attempt, the commissioner had no news about Yasin even when he was living in Delhi
 vah dakshin dilli ke shaheen baag ilaake main 2008 or phir 2011 main rahaa tha
 In 2008, Riyaz and Iqbal also stayed with him
 farvari 2010 main pune main dhamaake or mumbai main july 2011 main serial blast sahit anya shaharon ko dahalane ke baad 2011 ke ant main yaccin phir se dilli aakar rahaa tha
 Former IB director Ajit Kumar Doval, who has worked as a field operative, says there is no other option but to 'fight danger'
 dobhaal ke mutabik, suraag ab bhi milte hai lekin unhen unke taarkik ant tak pahunchane ke liye prayaas karne kii jarurat he
 According to Doval, who has strongly advocated for the creation of the National Counter Terrorism Center, "since the operatives want a quick solution, the task of collecting information has become sluggish
" ’’internet par najar rakhana or phone tap karwaanaa soochna ikattha karne kaa pramukh strot ban gaya he
 But in terms of reliability, they cannot match the information from the sources
 vyakti se khod-khodakar manachaahi jaankaree praapt kii ja sakati he taaki use karrwai karne yogya soochna main tabdeel kiya ja sake
 While additional information could not be obtained from the information obtained through phone tap
 yahi vajah he ki ‘alert’ din-ba-din or bhi aspasht hote ja rahe hai
 Says Doval, "there is a need for a competent leadership who can encourage its people
" kaam ke tareeke or ranneeti ko badalane kii bhi jarurat he kyonki vartmaan pranali hamaare kaam nahin aa rahi he
 The need for new technologies While addressing a conference in September 2011, the then IB chief Nehchal Sandhu admitted that the police system was not so fast and agile as to change its tactics and strategies against the terrorists
 unhone kaha, ‘‘aatankwaadi chote-chote samoohon main kaam karte hai
 So it is possible that we have to leave our old techniques and adopt new techniques in their place
 ’’lekin ek ore jahaan ibi takanic par zyada se zyada nirbhar hota ja rahaa he, vahiin vah ab bhi takanic ke maamle main aatankwaadiyon se peeche he
 By the time the intelligence agencies started listening to the terrorists' mobile phone conversations, the terrorists had started using satellite phones
 26 / 11 hamale ke baad tatkaaleen ro pramukh bi
 K
 chaturvedi ne saarvajanik rup se daawa kiya tha ki thuraayaa satellite phone kii nigaraanee se unhen aatankiyon ke aakaaon ke thikaane kii jaankaree mili thi jise unhone saz kiya tha
 After this, the terrorists started using the location spoofing application (application keeping the location secret) available overnight for $ 10
 jisase khufia agenciyon kaa soochna ekatra karne kaa yah jariya bhi band ho gaya
 Terrorist organizations are now using new Inmarsat satellite phones
 ye phone vaayas ko jatil encripshan main badal dete hai
 There is a huge shortage of human resources, about 25,000 people work in IB
 yah sankhya ibi ke liye manjuur maanav sansadhano ke aankade se lagbhag 10,000 kam he
 The biggest drawback is grade 2 level officers — these are field operatives that are considered the agency's backbone
 ibi ke ek varisht adhikari kehete hai, ‘‘grad 2 pad ke liye aavedan karne vaale yuva mahaj surakshit sarkari naukari chaahate hai
 Their effort is to get a safe and comfortable assignment
 ’’yahaan tak ki aalaa str ke adhikari bhi deputesan par ibi main nahin aana chaahate
 Officials once considered an appointment in IB to be good for their career, but no one wants to go to this major investigation agency and it is considered as forcible
 rajyon ke police bal main padonnati jaldi hoti he or paisa bhi badhata he
 With the change of time, many changes are needed in the training of the operatives of the IB as there has been no change in its process for the past several decades
 ibi ke nae diarector saiyad asif ibrahim kya koi badlaav laa paaenge? ibi ke 125 saal ke itihaas main 1977 batch ke ipies adhikari ibrahim iske pehle muslim pramukh hai
 But officials who have been in the intelligence department for decades are skeptical that the IB will be able to get rid of its task of extracting intelligence especially of the leaders of the opposition

 rape kii jaanch ke liye 2 finger test ko sahi tehraane vaale circular par dilli sarkaar ne lipapoti kii taiyaari kar lee he
 According to sources, Health Minister Satendra Jain was not aware about the circular
 circular jari hone ke baad maamla garmane par swasthya mantri ne is mudde par samiksha baithak bulaai he
 It is believed that the Kejriwal government can take action against the officer who issued the circular to save his image
 jaane kya he tu finger testagauratlab he ki rape kii jaanch ke liye 2 finger test ko sahi tehraane vaala circular jari karne ke badadilli sarkaarne fouran ise waapas le liya
 The Delhi government issued an advisory justifying 2 finger tests based on a 14-page document of experts
 jisamen kaha gaya tha ki rape kii jaanch karne vaale doctoron kii suvidha ke liye is test par purnat: pratibandh lagu karnaa sahi nahin he, saath hi is test ko hataa dene par rape kii jaanch bhi nishpakshta se karne main mushkil aegi
 It is necessary to mention here that the use of this test to check the violence of Kiyon has been protested from time to time
 2 finger test jise 'pivi test' bhi kaha jaataa he rape kii jaanch ke liye istemaal kiya jaataa he
 In this, internal injuries are examined by putting fingers in the woman's genitals
 mahilaon ke liye kaam karne vaali kai sansthaaen is test kaa virodh karti rahi hai
 One reason for opposing this test is also that this test tests whether the victim of rape is addicted to sex or not
 2013 main supreme court ne is test par tippanee dete hue kaha tha ki yah test rape cerviver ke niztaa ke adhikaar kaa hanan karata he
 The apex court had directed the government to use a better way to investigate the rape
 bal adhikaar kaaryakarta raaj mangal prasad kehete hai, 'yah baat ab jagajaahir he ki 2 finger test yon hinsa kii jaanch karne ke liye ek gaiyr jaruri test he
 It is like a second rape with a victim of sexual violence from before
 'haalankisarkaarase jude ek sutara ke anusaar, sarkaar yah test kisi par thope nahin rahi
 This advisory has been issued only to put forward the government's stand on this issue
 yun bhi adwijuri main saaf likhaa gaya he ki is test ko karne se pehle peedit kii manjuuri lenaa jaruri he
 'it is a different matter that according to many ngos, this test in government hospitals runs indiscriminately
 kai maamalon main to peedit se is babat raay bhi nahin lee jaati

 6 se 10 over : aswin ne dilaai teesri safalataa 16 to 20 overs: rohit-pandya's brilliant innings mahendra singh dhoni kaa bike prem jagajaahir helekin bhartiya cricket team kaa captain superbike ke bare main itnaa gaharaa gyaan rakhata he ki unki maahi racing team ke world champion rider keenan sofoglu bhi hairaan-pareshaan ho gayi
 Keenan, who arrived at the Buddha International Circuit in Greater Noida to promote superbike racing in India, told reporters, "I know Dhoni has a lot of bikes
" vah bike ke bare bahut gahari jaankaree rakhte hai
 i was taken aback by this myself
 unhen iskaa acha takneekee gyaan bhi he or mujhe bahut khushi he ki vah hamaari team ke maalik hai
 Also passionate about motorbikes, Dhoni started the Mahi Racing Team in 2012, which is India's first superbike racing team
 is team ne 2013 main behtareen shuruyaat kii tathaa turki ke uske rider keenan austrailia ke philip island main pehali res jeetne main safal rahe jabaki team ke duusare rider france ke fabian forate chauthe sthaan par rahe
 Three-time world champion Keenan said, 'last time i came here, i had a brief meeting with Dhoni, but this time i had a long conversation with him
 hamane apane parivaar, bike, unke tiron, speed aadi par baat kii
 People here do not know much about cricket but i have started following this game now
 unhone kaha, ‘mujhe yahaan aakar pataa chalaa ki dhoni yahaan kitna bada star he lekin unka vyavhaar bahut acha he
 i personally like these people
 vah apane khel kaa champion he or mujhe vishwaas he ki hamaari racing team bhi champion banegi
 Keenan, however, had a lot of discussion before joining Dhoni's team as his mother refused to continue the dangerous motorbike career at that time
 unhone kaha, ‘mere chote bhai kii 2002 main ghar ke aage sadak paar karte samay maut ho gayi
 My elder brother lost his life to motorracing in 2008
 iske baad 2011 main mere pitaaji kaa 54 saal kii umr main nidhan ho gaya
 i am left alone among three brothers
 meri maa bahut chintit thi
 'keenan said,' Mother asked me to quit racing
 maine unase kaha ki main bijness nahin kar saktaa
 i am a player and do not know any other work
 maine maa ko samajhaayaa ki chota bhai ghar ke aage excident main maaraa gaya to phir maut to kahin bhi aa sakati he
 Eventually the mother agreed
 ab mujhe apni maa ke liye bhi vishwa champion bananaa he
 On this occasion, 30 Bikers of Group of Delhi Superbikers also showed their racing feat on the circuit
 unhen keenan or forate se baat karne kaa mauka bhi mila
 Both these racers could not practice here due to being part of the international racing team
 forate ne kaha, ‘superbike se jude utsaahi yuvaaon se milane ke alaava hamen buddha international circuit ke bare main jaanane kaa bhi mauka mila
 We had heard a lot about this circuit
 yahaan kaa anubhav hamen aage phayda pahunchayegaa
 The 15th phase of the World Superbike will take place on the Buddha International Circuit itself

 150 hotels in Karol Bagh have closed
 karol baag ke hotalon main kul saadhe paanch hajaar kamare hai or hotel kaarobaar se paanch hajaar log jude hai
 Around 12000 tourists stay in these hotels every month
 hotelein band hone se inamen kaam karne vaale karmchaariyon ke saamne rojgaar kaa sankat paidaa ho gaya he
 Nearly one and a half hundred hotels in the area have been closed after a fire broke out in a hotel in Karol Bagh
 in hotalon ke band hone se jahaan hajaaron logon ke rojgaar par asar pad rahaa he vahiin dilli aane vaale yatriyon ko bhi pareshaan hona pad rahaa he
 People already booking in hotels are no longer getting a room
 isko lekar vivaad ho rahe hai
 Managers and customers appeared in a hotel arguing
 rakesh ke parivaar ke logon ne hotel main booking kara rakhi thi lekin achaanak hotel ke baahar mentenes kaa board lagaakar hotel ke daravaaje touriston ke liye band kar die gaye
 Both the hotel owner and the customer are upset
 ek vyakti ne kaha ki unhone booking kara rakhi thi
 People have come from Mumbai
 ab kahaan lekar jaaun? saare hotel band hai or five star ke chargeej zyada hai
 Murali, the manager of a hotel, said that the fire department has closed all the hotels
 pani tak nahin aa rahaa he
 That is why the hotel is currently closed
 karol baag main jitendra joshi ne bhi apana hotel band kar rakhaa he
 His staff is sitting empty and there is silence on the counter
 fire department kaa nirdesh he ki jab tak paanch hajaar litre kii alag se tank nahin lagati he tab tak hotel band rakho
 Jitendra Joshi said that we have a tank of ten thousand liters, but now it is being said that keep a separate tank of five thousand
 karol baag main kareeb dhai sau se teen sau hotel hai jahaan 12000 tourist har maheene rukate hai
 Now the Fire Department and the Municipal Corporation have suspended the licenses of about 150 hotels for fifteen days
 jinke license suspend nahin kiye gaye hai ve bhi ab apane hotel band kar chuke hai
 The hotel association and the municipal corporation have their own arguments
 karol baag hotel association ke purv adhyaksh baalan kaa kahana he ki kahin aag lagati he to kya sari dukaane band kara di jaati hai? ham saare niyam maanane ko taiyaar hai lekin choti-choti chizon to lekar hamen pareshaan kiya ja rahaa he
 North Delhi Municipal Corporation Mayor Adesh Gupta said that if the Fire Department has suspended the license, we have also done it
 lekin ham pratadit nahin karnaa chaahate hai
 The fire at the Hotel Arpit in Karol Bagh killed 17 people but even after three investigations, no action has been taken against the negligent government officials
 karolbaag main agar dhai sau hotalon main se dedh sau hotalon ke license suspend kiye gaye to aap soch sakate hai ki fire department or nagar nigam ke adhikari kisi jaanaleva laaparvaahee barat rahe hai
 There have been many investigations, but like every time, no officer is responsible
 aravind kejariwal kaa kahana he ki jo lokapal bill sansad main paas hua he vah saansadon kaa nahin ruling party kaa he or party main sonia evam rahul kii chalati he
 This bill is promoting corruption and is dangerous for the general public, so we oppose this bill and reject it
 kejariwal ne bill main sibiai ke nahin rakhe jane par kaha ki isse lalu prasad or mulaayam singh jaise netaaon ko phayda hoga
 Lalu Prasad also took advantage of this in the fodder scam
 sibiai jab lalu prasad ke peeche padi to unhone sarkaar se madad lee or sarkaar ne sibiai ko hataaya
 Team Anna has refused to accept the government ombudsman bill
 arvind kejariwal ne kaha he ki loksabhaa se paarit lokapal bill se bhrashtachariyon ko sangrakshan milegaa
 Kejriwal while addressing the gathering in Mumbai said that it is not the Lokpal bill of the ruling party, but of Parliament
 arvind kejariwal ne kaha ki is lokapal bill ke praavdhaanon se mutabik bade log chori karke batch jaaenge, jabaki aam logon ko zyada takalif hogi
 He said that if the king steals, he will first be asked why an FIR should not be lodged against him
 duusari ore ek aam aadmi ke gunaah par usase kuch puche bina pehle maamla darj kiya jaataa he
 Arvind Kejriwal said that the government does not want the CBI to come out of its grip

 He said in earnest voice that in this country those who raise their voices against corruption are killed

 nirvachan ayog ne shanivaar ko aam aadmi party (aap) ke netaa arvind kejariwal ko notice jari kiy
 In the notice, he has been summoned for making 'unconfirmed' allegations against Delhi Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president Satish Upadhyay
 nirvachan ayog ne kaha ki upaadhyaay kii ore se shikaayat mili he, jisamen kaha gaya he ki kejariwal ne un par or bijepi ke dilli pradesh mahasachiv ashish sood par galat, aadharahin evam apusht aarope lagaae hai
 'satish Upadhyay's nexus with power companies' Commission said that it has also received a report in this matter by the Chief Electoral Officer of Delhi
 kejariwal ko apana jawaab mangalvaar dopaher teen baje tak daakhil karne ke liye kaha gaya he
 Upadhyay had approached the Election Commission on 14 January following Kejriwal's allegations that during a press conference, Upadhyay and Sood were asked to tie up with power companies
 nirvachan ayog ne kaha ki upaadhyaay kaa yah aarope bhi he ki ek bhaashan ke dauraan aap netaa ne bijepi par aarope lagaaya tha ki vah dilli main sampradayik hinsa bhadakaane kaa prayaas kar rahi he
 The Commission said that according to the Model Code of Conduct, no party should engage in such activities which lead to differences or incite hatred
 bhartiya surveykshan vibhaag jald hi mount everest kii oonchai ‘phir se maapega’
 In fact, the survey department wants to find out whether the height of the world's highest peak has actually decreased after the terrible earthquake in Nepal two years ago
 bhartiya surveykshan vibhaag kaa ek dal is abhiyaan ke liye do maheene main nepal ke liye ravaanaa hoga
 This campaign is being conducted at a time when doubts have been expressed by the scientific community about the elevation of Mount Everest
 mount everest kii aadhikarik rup se oonchai samudr str se 8848 meter upar he
 Surveyor General of the Survey of India Swarna Subba Rao said that necessary approvals have been taken for this project and this will also help in future scientific studies
 unhone kaha, ham ek abhiyaan dal ko mount everest ke liye ravaanaa kar rahe hai
 The elevation of Everest was announced in 1855, if i am not mistaken
 kaiyon ke dwaara isaki unchai naapi gai lekin bhartiya surveykshan vibhaag kii maap ko aaj bhi sahi unchain mana jaataa he
 According to the Survey of India, the height of Everest is 29,028 feet, we are going to measure it again
 unhone kaha ki nepal main do saal pehle bheeshan bukamp aayaa tha, iske baad se hi vaigyanik samudaay ko shaq he ki everest sikud rahaa he, dobaaraa naap karaane kaa yah ek kaaran he
 Apart from this, another reason is that it helps in scientific study and understanding of the motion of the plate
 raav ne ek kaarykram se itar kaha ki iske liye aavashyak manjuuri mil chuki he or yah abhiyaan ek maah main shuru ho jayega
 The comments unhone kaha ki is baar mount everest kii oonchai do tareekon ‘global pojishning system’ (jeepies) or ek jamini paddati se naapane kii yojana he
 (from inputs language) bhartiya surveykshan vibhaag ke maha surveykshak swarna subba raav ne kaha ki is pariyojna ke liye jaruri manjuuri le lee gai he or isse bhavishya ke vaigyanik adhyayanon main bhi madad milegi
 "we are sending an expedition to Mount Everest," he said
 everest kii oonchai kii ghoshnaa, agar main galat nahin hum to 1855 main kii gai thi
 Its height was measured by many but the measurement of the Survey of India is still considered the right height
 bhartiya surveykshan vibhaag ke anusaar everest kii oonchai 29,028 foot he, ham ise dobaaraa naapane ja rahe hai
 He said that there was a severe earthquake in Nepal two years ago, since then the scientific community suspects that Everest is shrinking, this is one reason for measuring again
 iske alaava doosraa kaaran yah he ki yah vaigyanik adhyayan or plate kii gati ko samajhane main sahaayta karata he
 Rao said on the sidelines of a program that the necessary approvals for this have been received and the campaign will begin in a month

 Customary custody at Delhi's IGI Airport has brought a new twist in the case of the death of a foreign national under suspicious circumstances
 postmortem ke dauraan marane vaale videshi naagarik ke pet se cocaine se bhare 75 capsule baraamad hue hai
 519 grams of cocaine have been recovered in the capsule
 ghatana vaale din custom department ne ram manohar lohia aspataal main uski medical jaanch karai thi, lekin eksre report main iskaa pataa nahin chal paaya tha
 Meanwhile, he died while being taken to the airport
 bolivian naagarik esaivi arambel ithopian flite iti-686 se addis ababa se aijiai airport par aayaa tha
 Customs officials were informed that the foreign national possessed a large quantity of drugs
 iske aadhaar parairport par custom adhikariyon ne use hiraasat main le liyaatha
 If nothing was found from his bag in the search, he was subjected to medical examination at Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital on suspicion of drugs inside the body, but no reports of drugs were found

 Doctors at the Medanta Center declared him dead at 10 pm

 loksabhaa chunaav main jeet darj karne ke baad ab duusare kaarykaal main bijepi rajyasabha main bhi khud ko majubat karne main jute gai he
 The BJP, which came to power in the Lok Sabha by winning a stupendous majority, does not currently have a majority in the Rajya Sabha, due to which a significant bill like triple talaq could not be passed by the House even after many attempts
 lekin ab tidipi ke 4 rajyasabha saansad bijepi main shaamil ho chuke hai jisase sattadhari khemaa ucch sadan main or majboot ho jayega
 The TDP currently has 6 mps in the Rajya Sabha but its 4 mps have joined the BJP
 isse vipakshi dal tidipi sirf 2 saansadon kii party rah gai he jabaki bijepi ke saansad 71 se badhkar 75 pahunch gaye hai
 TDP CM Ramesh, TG Ventkesh, g Mohan Rao and YS Chaudhary are joining the BJP and the party-change law will not remain in force if the 6 mps are broken in 6, thereby retaining the membership of these mps
 rajyasabha main kul 245 sadsy hote hai
 NDA currently has 100 members
 bahumat ke liye endie ko 123 se zyada saansad chahie honge
 That is, there is a shortage of 23 mps
 congress ke paas rajyasabha main ab sirf 48 jabaki tiemasi ke paas 13 saansad hai
 In such a situation, after TDP mps join BJP, BJP will need only 19 mps for majority
 abhi rajyasabha main endie ke siton kii sthitibijapi- 71annadramuk- 13jadyu- 06akali dal- 03shivasena- 03nominated- 03arpiai- 012020 tak bahumat ke karibais saal hi bihar or gujarat kii 3 rajyasabha siton par chunaav hone hai jo ravishankar prasad, amit shah or smriti irani kii jeet ke baad khaali ho gayi hai
 BJP is sure to win these three seats
 iske baad agle saal upi kii 10 rajyasabha siton par chunaav hoga, jisamen zyaadaatar par bijepi jeet darj kar sakati he
 Of these, 9 seats are currently with the opposition parties, out of which 6 are with SP, 2 BSP and 1 Congress
 tidipi saansadon ke paala badalane se jahaan ek ore bijepi majboot hui he vahiin duusari ore vipakshi khemaa kamjor ho gaya he
 The BJP has now come close to the majority mark in the Rajya Sabha
 sadan main bijedy or wiesarsipi jaise dal sarkaar ke saath hi khadey honge isaki puri ummid he
 Apart from this, some parties do not come into any camp and walkout from the house to benefit the government itself
 aise main ab loksabhaa ke baad rajyasabha main bhi bijepi majboot hoti ja rahi he
 Indira Gandhi is known as an iron lady in world politics due to her determination, courage and amazing ability to take decisions, but few would know that in childhood she feared the darkness like ordinary children
 indira gandhi ne apane sansmaran ‘bachapan ke din’ main iskaa ullekh kiya he
 He wrote that i was afraid of the dark, as perhaps every young child feels
 roj shaam ko akele hi nichali manzil ke khaane ke kamare se upari manzil ke shayankaksh tak kii yatra mujhe bahut bhaybheet karti thi
 Crossing the long, sprawling verandah, climbing the crumbling wooden stairs and climbing a stool to reach the door handles and light switches
 unhone likhaa he ki agar maine apane is dar kii baat kisi se kahi hoti tab mujhe puraa vishwaas he ki koi na koi mere saath upar aa jaataa yaa dekh letaa ki batti jal rahi he yaa nahin lekin us umr main bhi saahas kaa aisa mahatv tha ki maine nishchay kiya ki mujhe is akelepan ke bhay se apane hi chhutkaaraa paanaa tha
 Former foreign minister and senior leader Natwar Singh said that due to poor health of mother and busyness of father, her childhood did not pass like normal children but father Jawaharlal Nehru had a deep influence on her
 nehru ne bhi apni putree kaa har path par maargdarshan kiya
 The father's letter to the daughter is a living example of this
 indira ne bhi ise sweekaar kiya he
 He wrote that my grandfather was the head of the family, not because he was the eldest in age but because his personality was very influential but my father was at the center of my small world
 main unako pyaar, unki prashansa or sammaan karti thi
 He was the only person who had time to listen seriously to my endless questions
 unhone ne hi aasapaas kii chizon ke prati meri ruchi jaagrit kar meri vichaardhaara ko disha di
 Indira was not very fond of toys
 shuru main meraa manapsand khilonaa ek bhaaluu tha jo us puraani kahawat ko yaad dilaataa he ki dayaa se koi mar bhi saktaa he kyonki pyaar ke kaaran hi maine use nahalaaya tha or apni antee kii chahere par lagane vaali nai or mahangi french kriim ko us par thope diya tha
 In addition to being scolded by his aunt, i got spoiled forever by my beautiful bear hair
 gulam bharat kii chintaneey sthiti ko indira gandhi ne bachapan main hi bhaanp liya tha, unako samaj main aa gaya tha ki swatantraaa kitni jaruri he
 Singh said that Indira had formed a 'vanar Sena' in childhood with the cooperation of our children and friends
 unhen raajnneeti kii samaj viraasat main mili jisaki vajah se jald hi unka pravesh raajnneeti main ho gaya

 The organizers had appealed to the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court had stayed the High Court verdict allowing children up to 12 years of age to participate and had also stayed the elevation order
 lekin baad main supreme court ne is yachika kaa nistaaran kar diya
 According to the ASG, now the High Court is hearing the case considering the matter as contempt of court

 aise main samvidhan ke khilaaf kaam karne valichuni hui sarkaar ko hataaya ja saktaa haior hataaya bhi janaa chahie
 Shanti Bhushan claims that soon the Supreme Court will give its verdict in which the Kejriwal government will be defeated

 3
 aravind kejariwal ne dilli koworld class city banane kii bajaay varst city(sabase kharaab) bana diya he
