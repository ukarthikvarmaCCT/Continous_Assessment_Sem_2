 lakshmana jaise khilaadi keval do test maichon ke liye khud ko feet rakhane ke liye itani mehnat nahin karata
 This situation would not have arisen if the selectors had already expressed their opinion to Laxman
 unhone yah maamla agast tak kyon khinchaa
 Perhaps the thought of the selectors may have disappointed Laxman more
 ’ganguli kaa maananaa he ki shrikant kii chayan niti bhartiya cricket ke vikaas ke liye hanikaarak he
 He said, 'the selectors do not select the team keeping in mind the future of Indian cricket, but try to balance by subtracting or increasing something
 ’ganguli ko is baat par bhi aashcharya hua ki lakshmana ne press conferes main kaha ki uski captain mahendra singh dhoni se baat nahin ho saki
 Ganguly said, "the captain should be available 24 hours
 pataa nahin dhoni ne aisa kyon kiya
 i think if Laxman had the support of Dhoni, the situation could have been different
 ' Pakistan had agreed not to cite all UN resolutions and left the demand for a referendum
 yah 2007 ke shuru main hui kashmir vaarta ke masaude kii badi surkhi thi
 Its words were given both permission and consent by both sides at the top level, just to be signed
 usee samay tatkaaleen raashtrapati parvej musharraf ne pakistan ke pradhan nyaayadhish ko nilambit kar diya, sadakon par pradarshan shuru ho gaye, halaat dawandol hone lage
 Regardless, Musharraf sent a message through his trusted friend and behind-the-scenes dialogue messenger Tariq Aziz, "it's just a week or 10 days, everything will come under control
" ” ek hafte baad phir sandesh aayaa, ''do hafte or
 "time passed before anyone could understand anything
 saat saal baad donon deshon ke bich videsh sachiv str kii vaarta radd karne ke bharat ke faisle se lagata he ki vah mauka phir haath se nikal gaya he
 This poses the danger of revealing the basic truth of the draft carefully written Kashmir talks
 philhal vaarta radd karne kii vajah videsh sachiv vaarta se pehle hurriyat netaaon se milane kaa pakistani ucchayukta kaa faisla najar aata he
 But in reality the series started on April 30 before the NDA won the parliamentary elections and came to power under the leadership of BJP
 us din pakistani senadhyaksh general raahil sharif ne shahid diwas par sena ke mukhyalay main apane paaramparik sambodhan main kaha tha ki kashmir pakistan kii 'dukhati rag’ rahi he or kai dashak puraane is vivaad kaa samaadhaan sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad ke prastaavon ke anuroop hona chahie
 This statement was natural to raise eyebrows in New Delhi as it seemed that they were withdrawing from the main promise made by Pakistan
 yah bayaan kis samay diya gaya, yah bharat ke liye samajhnaa mushkil nahin tha
 In fact at the same time, another major promise made in this draft — the observance of a ceasefire along the Line of Control — was being repeatedly violated
 jahaan tak pakistan ke pradhanmantri navaj sharif kaa sawaal he, lagata he, itihaas khud ko doharaa rahaa he
 His army seems to be sabotaging efforts for a peace deal with India
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ke shapath grahan samaaroh main aane kaa bharat kaa nimantran sweekaar kar sharif ne ummiden jagaai thim
 This decision was not easy for him as India had also sent some conditions to keep the situation in view of the events of the failed summit in Agra
 pehali shart yah thi ki is yatra ko aupchaarik dwipaksheeya vaarta kaa mauka maanane kii bajaae ek samaaroh main shaamil hone ke pratik ke taur par dekha jaae
 Secondly, there will be no major announcement or joint release
 iske alaava koi aisa samvaad nahin hoga jisase mukhya aayojan se dhyaan bhatke yani koi sanyukt samvaadadaata sammelan nahin hoga or na hi hurriyat netaaon se mulaakaat kii rivaayat nibhaai jaaegi
 Pakistan took time to think, but once Sharif accepted the invitation, he kept his promise
 sharif ne sirf sada press bayaan jari kiya or khaskar hurriyat ke saath koi sampark nahin kiya
 The government understood that it had set a new precedent in this matter
 lekin pakistan ke ucchayukta abdul basit ne 17 agast ko hurriyat netaaon ko patr bhejkar 25 agast ko videsh sachiv vaarta se pehle charchaa ke liye aamantrit kar liya
 There was a sharp reaction in the power establishment of India
 modi or varisht mantriyon—rajnath singh, sushamaa swaraj or arun jetali ke bich phone par lambii mantranaaen huin
 a lot of issues arose from the increasing violation of the ceasefire to the electoral prospects in Jammu and Kashmir
 lekin asli bechaini is baat par thi ki pakistan, bharat main algaavvaadi guton ke saath charchaa kar rahaa tha jabaki nai sarkaar ne abhi uske saath yah vishay uthaaya hi nahin tha
 The decision was taken by noon on 18 August and the Ministry of External Affairs was informed about it
 lekin mantralay ke adhikariyon ne suzav diya ki jaise sharif kii yatra ke dauraan hua tha, usee tarah sarkaar pakistani adhikariyon ko nateezon kii chetavanee dete hue mulaakaat radd karne ko kah sakati he
 External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj agreed and spoke directly to Modi, who agreed
 videsh sachiv sujatha singh ne basit ko phone par bataa diya ki agar unhone hurriyat netaaon se mulaakaat kii to ve islamabad nahin ja paaengi
 It is said that Basit said in response that such meetings have always happened and this will help India in the internal situation
 is par sujatha singh ne palatakar jawaab diya, ''ham apane andruni halaat ko sanbhaalane main sakasham hai
 "and then it was announced that talks with Pakistan had been canceled
 (saiyad ali shah gilaani)sharif banaam sharifjab pakistan ke senadhyaksh general raahil sharif javaani kii dahalij par the tabhi unke bhai shabbir sharif 1971 ke yuddh main maare gaye the
 While he was mourning, one of his brother's companions came close and said never to think that his brother was no more
 usne raahil ko bharosa dilaayaa ki vah unhen apana bada bhai hi samajhe
 He was a fellow Pervez Musharraf and everyone in the Pakistani Army knows that Musharraf always stayed with him like a rock in the career of Raheel Sharif
 1976 main sena main kamishan lene ke baad general sharif ne bahut aasaani se kadam badaye
 He got the best placement and training abroad
 musharraf jab senadhyaksh bane to raahil akele brigadier the jinhen milane kaa samay mil jaataa tha jabaki unase varisht adhikari intjaar main rahete the
 This situation persisted even after Pervez Musharraf became President
 isliye jab pradhanmantri sharif ne musharraf par deshadroh kaa aarope lagane kaa faisla kiya to puraane sambandh aade aa gaye
 General Raheel opposed Prime Minister Sharif and from there relations deteriorated
 achaanak maulavee tahirul kadri logon kii bheed lekar imran khan ke saath sadakon par utar aae hai
 They allege that the elections were rigged last year
 ek saal ke bheetar bahumat se satta main aae navaj sharif kaa rajnatik bhavishya khatre main dikhne laga he
 Modi's decision to cancel the talks is another discount on his credibility
 aisa lagata he ki musharraf ke saath general raahil kii vafadari us kashmir vaarta par lagu nahin hoti jise unke sangrakshak ne apane chatur madhyasth or mitra tarik ajij ke jariye bharat ke saath taiyaar kiya tha
 The irony is that Prime Minister Sharif found power in the conversation which was miraculously kept alive despite changing the government in Pakistan
 vishwasaneey sutron se pataa laga he ki is saal bharat jab chunaav kii taiyaari main juta tha, tab bhi parade ke peeche sharif ke doot shehryaar khan or bharat ke doot satinder lamba ke bich kai mulaakaaten hui thim
 It is believed that Pakistan agreed that both countries could agree on this draft, given the political boundaries of Kashmir policy on both sides
 bharat or pakistan ke bich hue kisi bhi prayaas kii tarah is baar bhi adnga jald lag gaya
 This time the blockade came out as a speech by the Chief of Army Staff on 30 April
 (mirvij umr faruk)kashmir vaarta kaa masaudakashmir vaarta ke masaude ko taiyaar karne or aaj tak jinda rakhane ke liye ek dashak tak chah duuton ne kareeb 30 mulakaaton main lagbhag 250 ghante baat kii
 Some of these meetings took place in cities such as Dubai, Kathmandu, Colombo and Bangkok
 brajesh mishra, tarik ajij, je
 N
 dikshit, satinder lamba, riyaj mohammad khan or ab shehryaar khan ne madhyasth kii bhoomika nibhaai or inamen se har ek kaa apane-apane pradhanmantri yaa raashtrapati se sidhaa sampark tha
 Although experts believe that there has always been behind-the-scenes contact between India and Pakistan, but this phase started in 1999 when the Observer Research Foundation's R
K
 ke
 Mishra and former Pakistan Foreign Secretary Niaz Nayak were given the responsibility to open the way for this informal contact
 nayak kii paanch saal pehle islamabad main berahami se hatya kar di gai
 But sources say no official record of the contact was maintained and officials assisting him are said to have discussed the Chenab formula in which the river was considered a border
 iske liye ilaake main bada pherbadal karnaa jaruri tha or baad main aane vaale madhyasthon ne ise sampradayik bhi kah diya
 The process started between Atal Bihari Vajpayee's National Security Advisor Brajesh Mishra and Pakistan National Security Council Secretary Tariq Aziz during the tenure of Pervez Musharraf
 donon ne 2001 main bharat kii sansad par hue hamale ke baad samvaad phir shuru karne ke liye badi mehnat kii
 After this attack, the Indian Army was mobilized
 unki sabase badi safalataa yah thi ki vaajapeyi janvari 2004 main saarc shikhar sammelan ke liye islamabad gaye
 Both sides agreed that a ceasefire along the Line of Control would follow until a permanent solution was reached
 vaajapeyi ke satta se baahar hone ke baad bhi ajij is sampark kii pramukh kadi rahe
 Aziz, a frequent cigarette smoker and fond of bridge play, was Musharraf's classmate at Foreman Christian College University in Lahore
 musharraf sena main bhartee ho gaye or ajij pakistan kii rajasav seva main aa gaye
 Both continued to be friends and Aziz became his trusted and best advisor when Musharraf became President
 us samay pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne apni sthiti ekadam spasht kar di ki unke paas bharat kii simaaen badalane kaa janadesh nahin he, lekin ve is disha main kaam kar sakate hai ki niyantran rekha jaisi simaaen apraasangik ho jaaen
 India took a position to which Pakistan initially reacted slightly
 pakistan teen badi baton ko manwaane ke liye utsuk tha—kashmir ghati tak samprabhutaa kaa vistaar, siachin ko shaamil karnaa or simaaon main kuch pherbadal
 India wanted Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and the entire Kashmir including Gilgit and Baltistan to be brought under the purview of the agreement
 aakhirkaar pakistan maan gaya or aage baatcheet ke daravaaje khul gaye
 Ultimately, all discussion was reduced to sovereignty, as Siachen was removed from behind-the-scenes negotiations and the border issue was set aside due to political compulsions
 vishwasaneey sutron ne india today ko bataaya ki is najuk baatcheet kii vajah se hi is kshetra ke sanyukt prabandhan kaa vichaar upja jisamen pakistan raksha or kanoon tathaa vyavastha ko shaamil karana chahta tha
 India refused but did not abandon the wider idea
 pakistan ke liye yah sabase badi uplabdhi sabit hui
 The two sides agreed to create an india-pakistan joint mechanism through which Pakistan could interfere in governance issues such as trade, health, education, visit to shrines and culture but not in security
 is tantra kii sanrachana baad main tay honi thi lekin mul rup se ise 10-15 sadasyon kii salaahkaar sanstha kaa rup diya gaya jisaki baithak varsh main kam-se-kam do baar honi thi
 It could have Kashmiri representatives from both sides and elected representatives were also to be included
 yani isane musharraf ke chaar sutri formule ko hawa de di
 But there were tremendous talks on sovereignty issues
 pakistan bharat par dabaav daalata rahaa ki ghati main uski mudra kaa chalan vaid ho
 India did not agree, but was willing to recognize travel permits
 badale main pakistan ne sanyukt raashtra prastaavon ke paalan or janamat sangrah kii jid chhodie par sahmati di
 It was extremely important to keep such an attempt a secret
 ek samay lamba or ajij ko laga ki alag-alag thikaanon par milte rahane se kaam nahin chalegaa, jab tak inhen puri tarah chipaaya nahin jayega
 These cities were chosen probably because there were direct flights from both countries
 (shabbir shah)behad gopneejij khaas taur par chintit rahete the kyonki lambey samay tak islamabad se unki gaiyr-maujuudagi logon kii najaron main aa sakati thi jisase sawaal uth sakate the
 This is why Dubai became the most preferred destination
 donon madhyasth subah pahunchate, thodi der baat karte or usee raat laut jate the
 Both rarely informed their embassies for these visits
 sutron ne bataaya ki ve sailaani kii tarah safar karte the
 Booking was done through a business travel agency
 vahi hawaii adde par gaadi kaa intjaam karti thi
 The two approached each other only after reaching the hotel
 baatcheet ke alaava in mulakaaton main sirf faislon kii jaankaree di jaati thi kyonki madhyasth telephone, mobile yaa internet ke istemaal se bachate the
 It is said that both of them later decided their codes
 amritsar kaa matlab tha haa or lahore yani na
 Both used these words cleverly in SMS to report any movement or decision
 vaarta jab aakaar lene lagi to donon madhyasthon ne mahasoos kiya ki iesai ko bhi is prakriya se joda jaae kyonki uske anumodan ke bina aage baduya naammumkin tha
 For this reason take the Director General of ISI
 general ashfaq parvej kayaani ne prastaavit masaude ke har pahalu kaa baariki se adhyayan kiya
 Kayani, who became the army chief after Musharraf, also had some objections which were resolved
 sutara bataate hai ki iesai pramukh kayaani kii manjuuri ke baad hi antim masauda aage badha
 Kayani is said to be miffed that after the draft of the Warta was finalized, Manmohan Singh also entrusted the mediators with the responsibility to initiate a process of electoral information to opposition leaders about their possible visit to Pakistan in 2007 and its possible consequences
 usee samay america ke saath parmaanu qaraar par baatcheet chal rahi thi or sawaal uthne lage the ki kashmir samjhauta sambhddha sansadeey prastaavon ke daayre main hone ke baavjood kya use sansad se manjuur karana hoga
 After becoming the Chief of Army Staff in November 2007, Kayani changed his mind and proved to be a major obstacle in advancing the deal during the reign of Asif Ali Zardari
 landan main america duutavas se jari vikiliks cabel (08 landan 2968) main yah sabase acchhee tarah darj he
 It cites British diplomat Laura Hickey, who was then the head of the Pakistani contingent in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office
 yah cabel us samay kaa he jab tatkaaleen videsh mantri david miliband pakistan gaye the
 "hickey told that during this visit Miliband concluded that there should be agreement on Kashmir now
" jaradaari or manmohan singh taiyaar the or kaagaj par masauda taiyaar kiya gaya tha
 Miliband felt that there was only one obstacle left and he was General Kayani, the Chief of Army Staff of Pakistan
 ve anakani kar rahe the or unhen manaane kii jarurat thi
 Miliband was meeting in Islamabad on 25 November 2008
 26 november ko hamalavar ek trollar churaakar mumbai ja rahe the
 Over the next 48 hours, the political landscape changed and the behind-the-scenes dialogue cooled down for nearly two years
 modi kii adhuri shuruyatmanmohan singh ne apane aakhri kuch maheenon main apane staff ko nirdesh de diya tha ki kashmir par parade ke peeche jo kuch hua he, use yathasambhav darj kar ek foulder main agle pradhanmantri ke liye rakh diya jaae
 Sometime last month, Modi opened the folder, asked for information and has been thinking about the subject ever since
 sarkaar ke faisle kii ek vajah pakistan kaa hi yah taaja prastaav bhi ho saktaa he ki videsh sachivon kii charchaa ke muddon main se kashmir ko hataa liya jaae or iske bare main videsh mantriyon ke bich alag se baatcheet ho
 Pakistan is also willing to include terrorism in this dialogue to address India's concerns
 vastav main sarkaar ko faisla karnaa tha ki parade ke peeche sampark phir joda jaae yaa kashmir ko aupchaarik baatcheet kaa mudda banaaya jaae
 Instead, the government got involved in the case of the separatist organization Hurriyat, while the issue was settled in the very early negotiations behind the scenes
 bharat ne kashmiri pratinidhiyon ko shaamil karne kaa pakistan kaa suzav thukraa diya tha or shart rakh di thi ki yah sirf donon pakshon ke bich kaa samjhauta hoga
 Experts say that whatever happened outside its scope was just a show
 hurriyat se pakistan ke sampark kii vajah se pakistan se videsh sachiv str kii vaarta radd kar pradhanmantri narendra kii modi endie sarkaar ne is aavashyak uplabdhi ko dhundhala kar diya jo parat-dar-parat uljhi hui shanti prakriya ke liye behad jaruri thi

 Increasing pressure on Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar to resign over the controversy over the IPL Pune team's bid, the BJP accused the NCP president of misrepresenting the facts and demanded his resignation or the Prime Minister to take action against him
 bijepi shasit rajyon ke mukhyamantriyon ke do divasiy sammelan ke dauraan party pravaktaa ravishankar prasad ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha ‘agar pavaar istipha nahin dete hai to pradhanmantri ko unke khilaaf karrwai kerani chahie
 Prime Minister, you always talk about sovereignty of governance
 ham aapke kaary se isaki parakh karenge
 In Hyderabad also, BJP President Nitin Gadkari made it clear that Pawar should step down
 gadakari ne kaha ‘bijepi pravaktaa ne pehle hi is mudde par bol diya he
 This is the attitude of the party
 main is vishay par kuch or bolkar aapako koi sukhiryaan dena nahin chaahunga
 However, Ravi Shankar Prasad said "pawar is constantly misleading the nation and presenting false facts related to his role in the IPL bid
" ’ ipel pune team se judi boli main purv bisisiai pramukh sharad pavaar or unki saansad putree supriya sule vivaadon ke ghere main hai
 Pawar's family is said to have a 16 percent stake in City Corp, the bidding company for the Pune team

 Pawar, however, claimed that Anirudh Deshpande, managing director of City Corp, had bid in a private capacity
 is bich, bijepi shasit rajyon ke mukhyamantriyon ke do divasiy sammelan main sushasan ke liye ‘sakriy or loconmukhi’ pahal ke dohare siddhant ko manjuur kiya gaya
 As per the resolution approved at the conclusion of the conference, it was discussed in the conference how the process of decision making and its follow-up can be brought about on the basis of mutual experiences in the BJP ruled state
 sammelan ke dauraan sushasan ke liye is patibaddhta ke saath sakriy or loconmukhi pahal ko apanaaya gaya jisase alag tarah kaa shashan sunishchit ho sake
 According to the proposal, the BJP ruled states will adopt a policy of not tolerating against organized crime, terrorism, fundamentalism and Maoism

 During the closing ceremony of the two-day conference of chief ministers of bjp-ruled states, Sushma Swaraj advised the leaders of party-ruled states to win the hearts of the opposition on the lines of 'munnabhai'
 sushamaa ne kaha ‘hamaari vichaardhaaraein alag ho sakati hai lekin ham ek duusare ke dushman nahin ho sakate
 We live in the same country
 ’ unhone kaha ‘ham vipaksh ko alag kar loktantr kii kalpana nahin kar sakate hai
 Personal relations are above politics
 ’vipakshi dalon ke saath sauhaard badhaane ke tareekon kaa ullekh karte hue loksabhaa main vipaksh kii netaa ne kaha ki jin rajyon main bhaajapa kii sarkarein hai, unke netaaon ko pratidwandvi party ke saath nijee sambandh banane chahie, bhoj kaa aayojan karnaa chahie or guladaste bhent karne chahie
 He said that if the Leader of the Opposition asks for time, then he should try to give time as soon as possible
 ’sushamaa swaraj ne kaha ‘agar vipaksh kaa koi netaa aapke karyaalay yaa awaas par aata he to aapako yah sunishchit karnaa chahie ki koi vyakti uske swaagat ke liye ho or jab vah car se utre to aap aage badhkar uski agavani karen
 "he said" If any minister treats the opposition in this way, then the opposition's attitude is less aggressive
 ’ unhone kaha ‘agar vipaksh kaa koi vidhayak aswasth he, to sansadeey kaary mantri ko use shubhakamana vyakt karte hue guladasta bhejnaa chahie or mukhyamantri kii ore se jald swasth hone kii kaamana karata hua card

 prachand jeet hasil kar ek baar phir satta main aae pradhanmantri narendra modi is baar li se hatakar chal rahe hai
 PM Modi has added 'sabka Biswas' to his previous slogan 'sabka saath-sabka Vikas'
 or sarkaar kaa doosraa kaarykaal shuru hote hi iskaa asar bhi dikhnaa shuru ho gaya he
 Whether it is Anant hegde-maneka Gandhi's leave from the Cabinet, or the last warning given to Giriraj Singh on the Iftar tweet
 sarkaar or party kii puri koshish he ki is baar ‘sabakaa vishwaas’ par jor diya jaae
 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and his colleagues objected to Giriraj Singh's tweet regarding Iftar on Tuesday, due to the statements made in the previous term as well
 shaam hote-hote ye bhi khabar aa gai ki party adhyaksh or desh ke grahamantri amit shah ection main aa gaye hai or giriraaj singh ko antim chetavanee de di gai he
 The clear message is that Modi government is being cautious this time due to the unnecessary controversies faced by the Modi government many times in the last term
 pradhanmantri ke bayaan se mila sandesh
 
 
 After Modi's election, when Modi addressed the mps in the Central Hall of Parliament, he added everyone's trust with Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas
 or kaha ki alpsankhyakon ko abhi tak daraaya gaya he, hamen unka vishwaas jeetne kii jarurat he
 At the same time, he also gave a message to the big leaders of the party who always remained in the headlines only because of the statements
 pradhanmantri ne kaha tha, ‘hamaare hi kuch netaa aise hai jo media ko masala dete hai or subah uthte hi raashtra ke naam sandesh dete hai
 This leads to less discussion on the government's work and more on their statements
 aisi bayaanbaji se hamen bachanaa chahie’
 This message of the Prime Minister was considered a warning to leaders like Giriraj Singh, Sadhvi Pragya, Sakshi Maharaj
 sandesh ke baad dikhaa ection
 
 
 When PM gave a statement, action also started
 mahatma gandhi ke hatyare nathuram godse ko deshbhakt bataane vaaleen sadhvi pragna singh thakur ko piem modi ne man se maaf karne se inkaar kar diya to sansad bhawan main unki dua-salaam bhi nahin kubuli
 Apart from this, Anant Hegde, who talked about changing the constitution in the last term and supporting Sadhvi Pragya through tweet, was discharged from the cabinet
 vahiin chunaav prachaar ke dauraan voton ke hisaab se kaam kaa formula dene vaaleen menka gandhi ko bhi is baar mantri nahin banaaya gaya he, haalanki unke spikar banaae jane kii charchaa abhi joro par hai
 Not only this, Mahesh Sharma coming from Noida adjacent to Delhi has also been discharged from the Cabinet this time, he made many such statements about Muslims and dress in the last term, which increased the problems of the government
 maharashtra sarkaar kii ore se niyukt cameti kii shuukravaar ko bombai hoicourt main pesh report main kaha gaya he ki bachche apni aayu ke mukaable bahut baari skool bag dhote hai or 10 varsh se kam aayu ke 58 fisadi se zyada chaatr haddi rogon se peedit hai
 The division bench of Judge VM Kanade and Justice b Pikolabawala was informed that the 12-page report has been accepted by the government and a decision will be taken soon to implement its recommendations
 court ne report padhane ke baad kaha, ‘jald hi bacchon ko trollies bag le janaa hoga kyonki vartmaan main ve jo peeth valebste dhote hanve paryaapt nahin
 'judge Colabawala, whose children also go to school, said that' every subject is taught every day
 isliye ek chaatr ko sabhi pustaken or notebook le jaani hoti hai
 There should be a change in the timetable

 Addressing a rally called by the Dalit community in Jaipur, Rajasthan, on Tuesday, Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad said that now Bahujan society is going to become a separate identity
 rajasthan main bahujan samaaj parahone valrutyaacharon ko lekar sandesh dete hue chandrashekhar ne kaha ki bahujan samaaj ghodi par chadhega or moonch bhi rakhega, is par kisi ko aitraaj nahin hona chahie

 kabhi unhen moonchhen nahin rakhane diya jaataa, to kabhi unhen ghodi par chadhane nahin diya jaataa to kabhi unhen ucch jatiyon ke ilaakon se baraat nahin nikaalane diya jaataa
 While giving a message about the atrocities in Rajasthan, Chandrashekhar Ravan said that Bahujan society will climb on a mare and will also have a mustache, no one should mind
 saath hi chandrashekhar aaazaad ne yah bhi kaha ki rajasthan main daliton ke upar atyaachaar kii seemaa paar ho chuki he
 Either you improve, otherwise we will improve
 iske itar chandrashekhar aaazaad ne kaha ki rajasthan main bahujanon kaa bahut bada aadhaar he
 We will activate it in politics
 basapa kaa yahaan na koi cader he na hi aadhaar
 But we will bring Bahujans forward

 Let me tell you that in Udaipur district of Rajasthan, a case of beating a Dalit groom on a horse was beaten up
 chandrashekhar aaazaad ne kaha ki piem modi or bhaajapa ko haraana hi unka lakshya he
 Will Congress field candidates against you? On this question, Chandrashekhar Azad said that if he makes a candidate in Varanasi before him, ask the Congress
 lekin ab bahujan samaaj kii ek alag pahchaan banane ja rahi he
 Tell that Bahujans have a big vote bank in Rajasthan

 The idea that killed Mahatma Gandhi, who killed Kalburgi, who killed Gauri Lankesh
 ye vichaardhaara hinsa ke liye prerit karti he
 "the media wants to show only one side of me," said Digvijay Singh, "I was the first person who spoke against Osama bin Laden

 vyavsaayee or motiveshnal guru gym ron ne ek baar kaha tha, 'aap un paanch logon ke aivarej hai, jinke saath aap apana zyaada se zyaada vakt bitaate hai
 'it is one of the most well-known ideas in self-help
 ye zaruri nahin he ki 5 hi log hone chahie
 The thing to note is that the people who live around you are most affected by your life
 ab nishchit rup se 5 sahi logon ko dhundhna aasaan to he nahin, lekin aap un saathiyon or sahakarmiyon kii khoj kar sakate hai jinka jivan vaisaa ho jaise aap bitaana chaahate hai
 These 5 types of people should definitely be in your group of close friends
 jo financiel planning karata ho:investment or bachat kii aavashyaktaa ko samajhane vaale smart hote hai, ve log aage kii sochate hai or bhavishya kii planning karte hai
 They invest not only in keeping with difficult times, but also to meet the needs of their family
 aapaki dhan suraksha ke liye aapke jivan main aise logon kaa hona phydemand hoga
 They can influence you to invest in life insurance, which not only helps you save your tax, but also frees you from the worry of money
 jo fitness par dhyaan dene vaala ho:aapkaa sharir vastav main ek mandir hota he, ek aisa dost hona zaruri he jo apane diet or vyaayaam se khud kaa khyaal rakhata ho or aapako vaisaa hi karne ke liye prabhavit karata ho
 It may be that they also have a good health insurance plan - a plan like HDFC Life, which provides a comprehensive cover for critical illness, surgery and hospitalization, and saves your income and savings from heavy medical expenses
 Ho
 jise meditation kii aadat hon:meditation ke phaayde bahut hai
 a friend who does meditation daily would be a great companion to start meditation, and it will have a calming effect on you and your life
 jo realistic lakshya nirdhaarit karata ho:ham ek aise vyakti ke bare main baat kar rahe hai jo lakshya nirdhaarit karata he or us lakshya ko hasil karata he
 Not the one who forgets the commitments made on his new year on the second day of the new year
 kisi aise vyakti ko khojein jo realistic gols rakhata ho, jaise har maheene 1 kilo vajan kam karnaa, yaa har din ek pustak ke 10 pej ko padhanaa yaa acchhee tarah se apni ritairement kii planning karnaa
 Because when you retire, don't you want financial security? You get this protection only after retirement, with sufficient regular income, which will come from the retirement plan in which you invested while working
 jo jivan se pyaar karata ho:niraashaa kisi bhi chiz se badi hoti he
 Even a frustrated friend can put you in the grip of grievance and laziness
 apane jivan kaa puraa anand lene ke liye vyakti ko acchhee aadaton ko apnaane kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 a friend who loves life must also invest in term insurance so that he can live a good life even in difficult times
 aisa vyakti aapke friend cirkil ke liye bahut jaruri he
 It is not necessary that you keep these 5 types of people at the same time
 aise kisi ek dost ke saath bhi samay bitaana aapke liye phydemand he
 Your friends have a huge impact on you, who makes you you and decides who you will become in life
 So it is important to choose your friends wisely

 Controversy between the ruling Congress and NCP in Maharashtra has reached the politics of resignation
 dipti sienjit pavaarke istife ke baad ensipi ke sabhi mantriyon ne maharashtra ensipi adhyaksh ko apana istipha bhej diya he
 Meanwhile, a meeting of NCP Legislature Party will be held at 2 pm on Wednesday in which further strategy will be decided
 chachaa bhatija ke bich power game kaa natijeyensipi congress ko jatke par jhatka de rahi he or maharashtra kii sithasi jameen rah rahakar hill rahi he
 The first setback on the Richter scale of politics was recorded when Ajit Pawar, deputy CM and nephew of Sharad Pawar, resigned from the Chavan cabinet
 daleel ye ki aaropon se aahat hai or jab tak paak saaf sabit nahin hote pad par nahin rahenge
 After the resignation of Ajit Pawar, a question has arisen whether this is the result of a power game between uncle's nephew
 lekin ensipi ne tamaam sawaalon ko khaarij kiya, upar se daawa ye bhi ki maharashtra sarkaar kii sehat par iskaa koi asar nahin hoga
 The resignation of Ajit Pawar made the Congress conscious
 siem prithviraj chavaan ne aanan-fanan main sharad pavaar ko phone karke poocha ki istife kaa kya karnaa he
 According to sources, Pawar told Chavan that Ajit Pawar's resignation should be approved
 lekin maharashtra ke siem abhi or soch vichaar ke mood main hai
 On the other hand, despite Sharad Pawar's claim that the Maharashtra government is stable, 19 other ministers of NCP quota submitted their resignations to the Maharashtra NCP president shortly after Ajit Pawar's resignation

 But sources reveal that the NCP has decided that Ajit Pawar's resignation will not be returned

 ’ unhone kaha, ‘yah acha hua ki unhone istipha de diya
 MNS chief Raj Thackeray said that Ajit Pawar's resignation is merely a 'gimmick'
 baharhaal, baraamati se loksabhaa sadsy supriya sule ne kaha ki unhen ajit pavaar par garv he
 He said, 'NCP does not want to create political instability in the state
 ajit dada ne kaaphi soch-vichaarkar istipha dene kaa faisla kiya he
 i am proud of my brother
 ’pavaar ke istife se gathbandhan main daraarmaharashtra ke up-mukhyamantri ajit pavaar ke istife or phir rajya sarkaar main rashtravaadi congress party (rakanpa) ke 20 mantriyon ke bhi istife de dene se congress or rashtravaadi congress party ke gathbandhan main daraar aa gayi
 The fresh political situation has increased the pressure on Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan

 The Congress is acknowledging the hand of the Congress behind the media reports targeting Ajit and other NCP leaders

 Amid the uproar, Union Minister Niranjan Jyoti said in Parliament, 'I did not intend to hurt anyone
 na tha, or na he
 i apologize for what has come out of my mouth
 ' unhone rajyasabha main yah bhi kaha, 'yadi sadan ko lagata he to main ise lekar maafee maangane ko bhi taiyaar hum
 ' isse pehle subah loksabhaa kii kaarywahi shuru hone par congress ke netaa mallikajarun khadge ne is vishay ko uthaate hue kaha ki unhone kaarysthgan notice diya he
 He said that the minister's statement is highly objectionable
 desh main sampradayik dange ho rahe hai or aise bayaan die ja rahe hai
 The minister should apologize
 adhyaksh sumitra mahajan ne unke kaarysthgan prastaav ko manjuuri nahin di
 On this, the Congress members came near the Speaker's seat shouting slogans

 On the other hand, Rajya Sabha Congress Deputy Leader Anand Sharma raised the issue during the Zero Hour, saying that a Union Minister in democracy is expected to use decent language but in this case the kind of hate language used by the Union Minister
 And abuses cannot be tolerated at all
 unhone maang kii ki is maamle main pradhanmantri ko sadan main bulaayaa jaae or unase jawaab dene ke liye kaha jaae
 CPI (M) leader Sitaram Yechury also condemned the minister's statement and demanded that the Prime Minister be summoned to the House
 sapa netaa ramgopal yadav ne mantri se maafee maangane or unke maafee maangane se inkaar kiye jane kii sthiti main unase istipha lene athwa unhen mantrimandal se bakhrast karne kii maang kii

 He told the Chairman, 'you are the Patron of the House and the Vice President of the country
 samvidhan kii raksha karnaa aapaki jimmedaari he
 You should ask the government to remove the minister from the cabinet
 ' Leader of the House Arun Jaitley said, 'the minister made a statement yesterday which was not acceptable
 unhone iske liye donon sadanon main aa kar maafee maang lee he
 Whether or not he committed the crime will be decided outside the House as the House is not an investigating agency
 isliye sadan kii kaarywahi chalane dena chahie
 ' yechuri ne kaha ki jab tak mantri ko mantriparishad se nahin hataaya jaataa tab tak sadan kaise chalegaa
 Sharma said that when the Leader of the House (jaitley) was himself in opposition, then even the pending matters were raised
 aaj satta main aane ke baad unka rukh badal gaya
 Accusing the BJP of adopting double standards, he said, "law breakers have no right to become ministers of the country
" ' The Chairman appealed to the members to remain calm and let the Question Hour run

 Name of post: Apprentice Trainee Number of Posts: 50 Time: 1 Year Eligibility: Vocational (automobile) Intermediate Click here for more details bijepi ke upi pradesh adhyaksh keshav prasad maury guuruuvaar ko party se nishkasit dayashankar singh kii patni swati se milane aspataal gaye
 Maurya described Swati Singh as a stunning woman in the conversation till date and said that BJP is with her in every happiness and sorrow
 aage padhie swati singh, dayashankar or mayawati se jude muddon par maury ne kya-kya jawaab die
 
 
 There was a lot of speculation about the relationship between BJP and Dayashankar's family
 aaj aap unki patni swati singh se milane gaye, koi khaas vajah?maury:koi khaas vajah nahin
 Dayashankar Singh is a former BJP leader
 unke khilaaf karrwai hui
 They made a mistake
 lekin unke parivaar ke saath puri bhartiya janata party he
 We got information about him being unwell
 isliye main unka haalchaal lene ke liye gaya
 So that if they had any difficulty, i had a moral obligation
 isliye mahospataal gaya
 He prayed to God that he should be well soon
 aaj bhartiya janata party kii mahila morcha ne unke samarthan main pradarshan kiya
 So is it to be believed that Dayashankar Singh or his wife may return to BJP? Maurya: Action has been taken against Dayashankar Singh
 aisa koi vishay nahin he
 Right now that topic is finished by BJP, but the fight of today and the performance of today's fight was about the demand of action of Nasimuddin Siddiqui Singh
 sarkaar kii ore se bhi koi karrwai nahin ho rahi he
 There was no action from the BSP either
 yah spasht ho gaya he ki sapa basapa main mileebhagat ho gai he
 Sister has also forgotten the scandal of June 2, 1995
 bhaajapa dwaara jis prakaar dayashankar singh ke khilaaf jo karrwai kii gai
 The demand which he raised in the House
 vah doharaa hashr kar rahi hai
 Expect something else for yourself
 kya aapako lagata he ki dayashankar singh ke khilaaf karrwai jaldbaaji main ho gai?maury:bijepi ek jimmedaar rajnatik dal he
 It is the largest political party in the world
 bijepi ne jo mahasoos kiya ki aisa jo bolaa gaya ki vah galat tha
 Hence action
 ab ham basapa se apeksha kar rahe hai ki nasimuddin siddiki ne jo bahut badi galati kii he, uske liye unki party unako sajaa de
 BSP chief should punish himself
 akhilesh yadav unase buaa vaale sambandh nibhaaen, hamen koi aapatti nahi hai
 But he is the Chief Minister of UP
 mukhyamantri hone ke naate saarvajanik rup se bayaan diya tha ki basapa ke netaa ne badi galati kii he
 How Nasimuddin Siddiqui, who made a big mistake, is roaming in UP
 agar basapa nasimuddin siddiki ke khilaaf koi karrwai nahi karti he to kya is baat par charchaa ho sakati he bijep main dayashankar singh ko waapas liya jaae?maury:dekhie, se abhi vishay hi nahin he
 Now it is a matter that why the government is delaying in punishing the crime that has happened in UP, the punishment that should be awarded for that crime
 jo karrwai honi chahie, basapa pramukh ke dwaara wo kyon nahin ho rahi he
 Today's fight was this
 bada jabardast pradarshan kiya
 The government machinery was used solely to prevent women from coming to Lucknow
 mahila bal kii jagah vahaan par purush bal kaa istemaal kiya gaya
 Women are injured
 abhi meri ek kaaryakarta seemaa sonkar hospital main admit hai
 Right now i am coming to meet them
 ye sarkaar puri tarah se taanaashaahee par utar ai he
 Wants to kill upi kii kanoon vyavastha puri tarah fail ho chuki he
 But we have the right in a democratic way
 us adhikaar par hi prahaar karke vifal banane ke liye mayawati se milakar akhilesh jis raste par ja rahe hai, wo unke liye bahut ghaatak siddh hoga
 What is the opinion of the party regarding Swati Singh? Maurya: Swati Singh should be healthy soon
 unke sangharsh kii saraahna karte hai
 She is a stunning woman
 bhartiya janata party unke parivaar ke saath khadi he
 BJP is with them in any of their happiness and sorrow
 kya bhartiya janata party unhen chunaav ladaane par vichaar kar sakati he?maury:ye to abhi kaa koi vishay nahi hai
 We pray to God for him to be healthy
 abhi jo hamaari ladaai he, wo basapa ke dwaara or sapa ke dwaara karrwai karne kii maang he
 There was a protest today about the delay in that action

 According to the post-mortem report, no sexual harassment has been confirmed
 is ghatana se parivaar sakate main he or unhone kisi par andeh bhi nahin jataayaa he

 bihar ke up mukhyamantri or bhaajapa ke varisht netaa susheel modi ne somvaar ko yah kahkar ki agle vidhansabha chunaav main bhi NDA mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ke netritv main hi chunaav maidan main jaaegi ek saath kai raajnneetik atakalon par viraam laga diya he
 Two meanings are being immediately extracted from this statement of Sushil Modi
 ek bhartiya janata party filhal vidhansabha chunaav main nitish kumaar ko damp kar akele chunaav main kisi pichhadaa khaaskar kendriya grih rajyamantri nityanand raay ko mukhyamantri pad kaa cheharaa banaakar chunaav main nahin janaa chaahati he
 Secondly, there is no backdoor discussion with the party's central leadership with Tejashwi Yadav
 jiske kaaran chaara ghotaalaa main jab rajd ke supremeo lalu yadav kii zamaanat kii yachika aae tab CBI unke prati narmi kaa rukh akhtiyaar karegi or uske badale jab bhi bhaajapa nitish kumaar ko vidhansabha chunaav se pehle damp kaa koi raajnneetik taana bana bunane kii koshish karen tab rajd kii bhoomika nitish ke samarthan me naa hokar tatasth rahegi
 When Sushil Modi said in his statement that why someone would want to ride the sinking Naiya, then certainly his gesture was towards Chief Minister Nitish Kumar
 is baat main bhi sachai he ki agar ab aagaamee vidhansabha chunaav main ve chaahe nitish kumaar hon yaa raajnneeti kaa koi nausikhia vidhyaarthee, agar uske paas chunaav maidan main saamne muqaabala karne ke do vikalpon main ek taraf pradhanmantri narendra modi or aaj kii BJP ke saath do-do haath karnaa ho or duusari taraf raajnneeti main bina sangharsh pita kii krupa se sab kuch paane vaale tejasvi yadav hon, jo ek haar bhi bachaa paane kii kshamta nahin rakhte hai to nishchit rup se koi bhi tejasvi yadav ko hi chunegaa
 Because of the vote bank that the NDA has today and the rjd's disastrous situation, the re-election of Nitish Kumar as Chief Minister in Bihar has become a formality
 haalanki BJP ne nitish kumaar ko bhi apana yaa endie kaa cheharaa maanakar ek tarah se raajnneetik sandhi kaa sanket diya he kyonki unhen maaloom he ki bihar ke trikoniya raajnneeti main wo agar nitish kumaar ke saath zyaada ched-chhaad karenge to ek baar phir unhen vipaksh main baithne kii sambhaavna se bhi koi bachaa nahin saktaa
 On the other hand, Nitish Kumar can be a source of trouble for the BJP outside the state more than Bihar by staying in opposition, so why would anyone want to take such a risk sitting
 haalanki raajnneeti main aisi baat bhi nahin he ki BJP kii nazar bihar ke mukhyamantri pad kii kursi se hat gai he lekin wo kursi unhen aasaani se nitish kumaar ke baad unke ek yaa do shashan kaal ke baad baithe baithaae mil jaaegi ye party main adhikansh logon kaa akalan he
 But the impact of Sushil Modi's statement will be seen on the RJD because once again there is no option left except to nail his nails because he is always in the Lok Sabha elections or the assembly was in a tizzy that tensions with BJP increased due to Be compelled to come to them
 lekin unki yah manokamana dhari kii dhari rah jaaegi or ab lalu yadav ko bhi maaloom he ki unke vidhayakon ko ekajute rakhana unki anupasthiti main unke beton khaaskar tejasvi yadav ke balboote to nahin kyonki jo betaa apane baap kii vidhansabha main rahane kii vinati bhi ansuna kar detaa ho wo unki raajnneetik viraasat ko khatm kar de to isamen koi aashcharya nahin

 dhamaakon main 14 logon kii maut ho gai, jabaki kareeb75 log ghayal hai
 a stampede also occurred after the blasts
 grahamantri susheel kumaar scindia hyderabad pahunchane vaale hai
 It was around 7 in the evening that the area of dilsukh Nagar in Hyderabad resonated one after the other
 pehla blast 7 baj kar ek minute par par hua
 The blasts took place near Venkatadri Cinema in Dilsukhnagar area
 jab tak koi kuch samaj paata tab tak duusare balast kii aawaaj konark cinema haul ke kareeb bas stand ke paas se sunai di
 The second blast took place at seven to six minutes, there were many shops for food items
 doosraa dhamaakaa itnaa joardaar tha ki bas ke bheetar baithe log bhi ghayal ho gaye
 a third blast also occurred a few minutes later and a live bomb was damaged
 chashmadido kii maane to blast kii aawaaj ek kilometre dur tak sunai di
 After the serial blast, there was chaos in the whole area due to the possibility of terrorist attack
 police ne puure ilaake ko sil kar diya
 Dilsukhnagar is the outskirts of Hyderabad, where it is very crowded due to its fruit market
 filmon ke theatre hone kii vajah se bhi shaam ke vakt ilaake main bheed kaaphi bad jaati he
 Due to the crowd, many times it takes too long to cross the road
 balast ke baad police ne puure ilaake ko gher liya
 Timers were found in the initial investigation from the blast site
 jaahir he ki aatanki hamale kii ashanka se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa
 The serial ballast in Hyderabad also shook Delhi
 grih mantralay ke mutabik andhra padresh sarkaar ko mangalvaar ko hi khufia jaankaree ke aadhaar par alert rahane ko kaha gaya tha
 Earlier in 2007, Hyderabad was also a victim of terrorist attacks
 us samay makka masjid samet teen jagahon par visphot hue the or dilsukh nagar main ek bam rakhaa gaya tha, jise fatne se pehle hi naakaam karne main kamyaabi mili thi
 Suspicion dipping towards the Indian Mujahideen No organization has claimed responsibility for the Hyderabad blasts, but the needle of suspicion is pointing to the Indian Mujahideen
 shuruaati jaankaree ke mutabik bam dhamaakon main motorcycle or cycle kaa istemaal kiya gaya he
 Information about the use of timers to carry out the blast is also coming out
 dhamaakon main kai logon ke maare jane kii pushti ho chuki he
 Timer recovered from the blast site has also started investigation, but according to the initial information that is revealed, the blast took place between 7 pm and 7 pm
 ek dhamaake main tiffin box kaa istemaal hua he jise ek motorcycle par rakhaa gaya tha
 The number of the motorcycle is AP 29 g 6294
 jabaki ek dhamaake main cycle ke istemaal kii soochna aa rahi he
 The police also recovered a timer from the blast site
 hyderabad police ke mutabik blast ke peeche indian mujahiddeen kaa haath ho saktaa he
 It is also feared that ID may have been used to carry out the blasts
 sabhi dhamaake 100 meter ke bich hi hue hai
 Intelligence agencies had already made the alert
 Intelligence agencies had issued the alert only on 18 February
 agenciyon ne desh ke baahar se ghuspaith kii pehle hi khabar de di thi
 According to sources, 4 people had infiltrated from Nepal
 iske baad khufia agenciyon ne 4 shaharon main blast kaa khatra jataayaa tha
 The name of the Indian Mujahideen behind the blasts is also coming out because the Pune serial blasts of August 2012 were also done in exactly the same manner
 pune ke serial blast main bhi blast ke liye cycle kaa istemaal kisia gadha tha or 6 dhamaakon kaa vakt bhi shaam 7 baje se shaam 7 bajkar 14 minute ke bich hi tha
 Hyderabad blasts have happened in the past, Hyderabad has already suffered the wounds of bomb blasts when about 60 people lost their lives in August and May 2007
 police ke saath-saath suraksha agencixan bhi jaanch main lag chuki hai lekin ye saaf jaahir he ki khufia jaankaree milane ke baad bhi agar hyderabad main dhamaakaa hota he to ye yakeenan rajya sarkaar kii ek badi chook he
 During this massacre, 55 people were reportedly killed and many were injured when security forces opened fire on people protesting against the persecution of government forces during a night-to-day search operation

 After breaking ties with JDU, a scathing article has been written on behalf of Shiv Sena on the disintegrating clan of NDA
 shivasena ne bijepi se poocha he ki vah bataae ki endie kaa kunba kahaan se badhaayaa jayega, nae dost kahaan se aaenge
 Not only this, Shiv Sena has questioned the existence of NDA itself, and has also quipped Advani's advice in which he has advised other parties to be added to NDA
 saamana main likhaa gaya he ki varisht netaa alke adwani ne salaah di he ki nae mitra jodie
 Are they any crops to sow seeds and grow every year? Friends are like a tree, which has to be cherished
 agar chaaya or fal dene vaale vriksh ko todaa jane laga to nae mitra aaenge kahaan se? The JDU, which has been with the BJP for 17 years, left, instead of adding new friends, is leaving what they were
 ab endie main bachaa koun he? shivasena, akali dal or bijepi
 13 mps from Punjab come and the Akali Dal does not go beyond four-five here
 tippaniyan Will the BJP alone be able to contest on its own
 agar nahin to rashtriya str par uske nae saathi koun hai yaa jaahir kiye jane chahie
 Will Mamta support BJP? Will Naveen Patnaik return to NDA in Orissa? Will Yeddyurappa be celebrated? Will Jagan come with Congress NDA? Jayalalithaa may be friends with Modi, but will she come to the NDA? aajkal koi kisi kaa na to dost hota he or na hi dushman
 If friendship is true then friendship grows
 adwani kii salaah ke baad to hamaare mitron ko saavdhaan ho janaa chahie
 Friendships broken by insult and fraud can never be added, and friends should take responsibility for not breaking it

 agar dosti sachhee ho to dosti badhati he

 All opposition leaders, including the Congress, said, 'there is already a shortage of jobs in the country, in such a situation, this step of providing 10 percent reservation will once again prove to be a jumla given by the Modi government at the Center
