 darasal dilli main ek hi jagah se, ek saath, ek hi vakt, ek hi company main kaam karne vaale 5 logon kaa apharan ho jaataa he
 But what happens next is really shocking
 saurabh har rose kii tarah us din bhi apni garlfriend shivika se milane ke liye apni company ke rest house main aayaa tha
 But at that time he did not know that he was going to be in a trouble
 aane vaale khatre se anjaan vah kamare kaa daravaaza khatkhatata he
 The door of the room was opened by his girlfriend Shivika
 darasal shivika saurabh kii hi company main kaam karti thi
 The two had come close to each other as they passed
 donon kii mulakaaton kaa silsilaa badhane laga tha
 Now both of them started loving each other
 shivika ne saurabh ko ek 'drink' pilaayaa
 After a while drinking, Saurabh lost his consciousness
 saurabh ko jab hosh aayaa, to usne khud ko ek anjaan kamare paaya
 But his girlfriend and company three people were sitting in front of him
 saurabh ko itnaa samaj main aa chukaa tha ki wo kisi musiibat main funs chukaa he or is vakt vah in logon ke rahamokaram par he
 Seeing Saurabh conscious, Shivika out of the four told Saurabh that some people have kidnapped all of them and they have even arranged to give Rs 80 lakh to the kidnappers
 agar saurabh apni jaan bachaana chahta he, to wo kidanapers ko 18 lakh rupee de de
 Saurabh immediately agreed to this
 usne apane ghar phone kiya or kaha ki wo kidanapers ko 18 lakh rupee de den
 Saurabh's family also gave Kidnappers a ransom of 18 lakhs
 phiroti kii rakam milane ke baad aparankartaaon ne saurabh ko ek shart par azaad kiya ki vah apni company ke baaki karmchaariyon ko wo 80 lakh rupee lautaa degaa, jo unhone khud ko kidanapers ke changul se bachaane ke liye unhen die hai
 Saurabh agreed to this
 uske baad uske aparankarta ne saurabh ko 25 disambar 2013 ko chhod diya
 Saubhah approaches the police after Kidnappers is released from the clutches
 police bhi uske apharan kii kahani sunakar hairaan rah gai
 But the biggest question before the police was who had kidnapped Saurabh and who were involved in this conspiracy
 bas inhen sawaalon ko saamne rakh police ne apni tahaqiqaat shuru kii
 The police decided to interrogate Saurabh's employees and his girlfriends, who were abducted by him
 poochtacha karne ke baad baad bhi vah kisi nattejey tak nahin pahunch pai
 But when the police strictly interrogated them, one of them broke in front of the police and told the police the truth about Saurabh's kidnapping, all were shocked
 darasal in sabhi ne milakar saurabh ko kidanap karne kaa plan banaaya tha
 The kidnapping was outsourced so that no one suspected them
 yani kidnaping kisi or giroh ne kii thi
 The most surprising aspect of this plan was that Saurabh's girlfriend Shivika Chauhan was also involved in this kidnapping plot
 itnaa hi nahin, shivika hi apharan kii is saazish kii mastermind bhi he
 According to the police, Shivika Chauhan, along with Saurabh's workmen Raj Walia, Arun Bohra and Sunny, carried out the kidnapping
 plan ke mutabik hi 22 disambar ko usne saurabh ko phone kar usee ke guest house bulaayaa or vahaan par unhen nashila padaarth dekar behosh kar diya
 He then handed over Saurabh to professional kidnappers called from outside
 itnaa hi nahin, un sabhi ne milakar saurabh ko yah bataaya ki ki kidanapers ne uske alaava un chaaron kaa bhi apharan kar liya he
 After this, Saurabh was released after recovering a ransom of around 1 crore
 philhal police ne is maamle main un chaaron profeshnal kidanapers- sunil rathi, krishna, ravi or sandip ko giraftaar kar liya he
 But Saurabh Ahuja's four employees and girlfriend Shivika Chauhan are involved in this kidnapping plot
 whatsapp duniya kaa sabase zyada yuj kiya jane vaala instent miseging ap he or ise sicyor mana jaataa he
 whatsapp has been purchased by Facebook in 2014 itself
 fasebuk ke siio mark jakarberg ne kaha he ki privet miseging sirf fasebuk ke future ke liye mahatvapurn nahin he, balki yah fasebuk kaa future he
 Actually Mark Zuckerberg has written a post which is completely focused on privacy
 chunki cambridge analitica ke baad se fasebuk privesi ko lekar sawalon main rahaa he or jakarberg kii aalochana bhi hui he, isliye ab company privesi ko lekar koi chook hone dena nahin chaahati
 The title of this post by Mark Zuckerberg is 'A privacy focused vision for social networking'
 is post main unhone privesi ke bare likhaa he
 According to Zuckerberg, in the coming time Mark Zuckerberg has made it clear that in the coming time, end to end encryption will not be removed from whatsapp and Facebook Messenger
 unhone kaha he, ‘sabhi privet communications ke liye and tu and ancripshan lagu karnaa acchhee cheez he’bharat main whatsapp privesi or ancripshan ko lekar kuch samay se lagaataar charchaa he
 Fake news and rumors have emerged as major problems
 isse nipatane ke liye sarkaar chaahati he ki watsap phek news yaa afvaah failaane waalon kaa origin pataa kare, lekin watsap main and tu and ancripshan kii vajah se asambhav he
 Recently, Engineer from whatsapp came to India and while answering a question, he even said that if the tool that the government is talking about, if it is brought, then whatsapp is not known for what it is
 yahaan unka bhi yahi kahana tha ki and tu and ancripshan hone kii vajah se sender or resiver ke alaava koi teesraa ise intercept nahin kar saktaa, yahaan tak kii koi agency bhi nahin
 In such a situation, it is now clear from this post by Mark Zuckerberg that there will be no tool to trace people in whatsapp
 jakarberg ne kaha he, ‘communication kaa future teji se privet ho rahaa he, encripted sarvice kii taraf shift ho rahaa he jahaan log confident ho saken ki wo ek duusare baat chit karte hai wo sicyor hai or unke massej sicyor hai
 i want a similar future and we will help in bringing it up

 Actually, a Chinese man was upset due to a persistent cough for a long time and because of this he went to the doctor
 yahaan doctoron ne pehle shaks kaa siti scan (CT Scan) kiya lekin unhen usamen kuch pataa nahin chalaa, jiske baad unhone endoscopy kii ek takanic brocoscopy test kiya
 In this test, the doctors came to know that there are 2 leeches in the nose of the person
 is ghatana ke bare main shaks ko us vakt pataa chalaa jab use lagaataar ho rahi khaansee main khun aane laga or usne china ke phujiaan ke longyaan main sthit wooping county aspataal (wuping County Hospital) main jane kaa faisla kiya
 Here the person showed himself in the Respiratory Department of the hospital
 aspataal main ilaaj ke dauraan shaks kaa test karne ke baad doctoron ko pataa chalaa ki uski naak kii dayee nasika (right Nostril) main ek jonk rah rahi he or jabaki ek anya jonk 3 centimetre andar glotice main rah rahi he
 It is the part between the vocal cords
 haalanki, doctoron ne 2 maheenon se rah raheen in donon jonk ko vyakti ke sharir se baahar nikaal diya he
 To remove these leaks, the patient was first given anesthesia, which was then taken out with the help of tweezers
 doctoron kaa maananaa he ki jangal main kaam karne vaale is shaks ne pahaado se pani pite vakt bina ehsaas hue in jokon ko nigal liya tha

 The second and third reason is that many stickers apps are going to look the same and have the same behavior and this is also against the guidelines of the Apple App Store
 watsap stickers launch hone ke baad developers ne stickers ap bana kare stores par aplod karnaa shuru kiya
 Since whatsapp also supported stickers from third party developers, many sticker apps started getting available in Android and ios

 Good news for those driving diesel cars

 This is because in the international market, crude oil prices have fallen below $ 100 after a long time

 According to the newspaper, this will bring great relief to the country's economy

 On the other hand, oil prices are going down

 The work will be done on redesigning of the roads, the entire plan will be announced, the pollution in Delhi is going to be halted, it will be supplied in 5 years 24 hours water
 Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has prepared a plan to redesign Delhi's roads
 buudhvaar ko nai dilli ke kanvension centre main kejariwal ne dilli main trephic kii samasya se nipatane ke liye nayaa elaan kiya he
 Here Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal came to participate in the 'delhi Ki Soch' program organized by ASSOCHAM
 arvind kejariwal ne kaha ki dilli main trephic kii samasya ko khatm kiya ja saktaa he
 Like the roads of Delhi are very wide, but the 4 lane road goes ahead to 3 lanes and then suddenly 6 lanes
 dilli kii aisi sadakon ko ridizin karne kii zarurat he
 Kejriwal said that the problem of Delhi is that there are many agencies
 hamane 9 sadakon ko ridizin karne kaa plan banaaya tha lekin antarrashtriya kansaltent hair karne main saadhe 4 saal lag gaye
 Now the consultant has been hired
 jald puure plan kaa elaan karuunga
 Controlling pollution: Arvind Kejriwal announced the steps being taken for pollution and said that there has been a lot of pollution in Delhi
 pichley 3 maheene se air quality good category main he
 The air was so clear that the moon and the stars also appeared on the sky
 hamaara makasad he ki dilli main 365 din chand or taare dikhen
 The Center, Corporation and Delhiites played an important role in tackling pollution
 ab saal ke 365 din pradooshan ko kam karnaa he
 Apart from making arrangements to improve the transport system, Kejriwal talked about involving the private sector to improve Delhi's transport system
 unhone kaha ki 3 se 4 hajaar basen public transport main jud jaaengiek mobile ap kii madad se bas kii lokation trek kar sakenge

 On this too, a policy will be announced in the next 15 days
 saaf hogi dillikageriwal ne dilli ko agle 5 saal main saaf karne kaa vaada bhi kiya he
 Arvind Kejriwal said that after this Delhi has to be clean and tidy
 dilli bahut gandi he
 There is garbage everywhere
 naaliyaan or siver bah rahe hai
 But cleanliness of Delhi is not rocket science
 puri duniya ne solid west management kar liya to dilli kyon nahin kar sakati
 But MCD is running separately, Delhi government is separate, Central government is different, DDA is running separately
 ise fiks karke dikhaaenge or 5 saal main dilli ko saaf sudhara karenge
 Further Kejriwal said that modern cities become stricter for the lower class
 lekin ham aisi dilli chaahate hai jo garibon, middle class or sabakaa pyaar mohabbat se khyaal rakhe
 We want a smart Delhi where a lot of technology is used
 har dilli vaale ki soch or sapane jaanane kii jarurat he
 Claiming to provide 24 hours of electricity, Kejriwal said that in the last 5 years, he has tried to fix the basic needs of Delhi
 aaj dilli main 24 ghante bijli aati he
 3 years before today i did not think of electricity 24 hours in my dream
 kuch ilaakon kii list rah gayi he jahaan local transformar badalane hai
 The problem is due to not getting the land
 khambe par transformar lagane kii takanic se hal nikalegaa
 Now the policy of the government is that if there is a power cut, then the power company will have to pay damages
 lekin aaj dilli main sabase sasti bijli he or company munaafe main chal rahi he
 This happened because we are working honestly, we do not make money here and there
 5 saal main 24 ghante milegaa panikageriwal ne kaarykram ke dauraan daawa karte hue kaha ki aaj 93 fisadi dilli main pipeline bich chuki he
 Within the next year and a half, Delhi will get 100 percent water from the bottleneck
 lekin abhi 24 ghante pani nahi aata he jiske liye nayi takanic par kaam kar rahe hai
 Our government will connect every house in Delhi to conserve rain water
 agle 5 saal main 24 ghante pani milegaa
 Further, Kejriwal said that our government is providing good health education facilities to the rich and poor

 Delhi had a tax collection of 25 thousand crores in 2010, which has increased from 30 thousand crores to 60 thousand crores between 2015 and 2019
 kyonki vyapaariyon ne ham par bharosa kiya, hamane red maarani band kar di
 i was in income tax, i know what happens when i kill red
 vahaan sarkaar ko nahin, personal tex aata he
 Let me tell you that assembly elections are going to be held in Delhi soon
 kejariwal sarkaar apane kaamkaaj par vot maangane ke alaava, rojaanaa nae elaan bhi kar rahi he

 Earlier this figure was Rs 20 for cities and Rs 15 for villages
 yojana ayog ke mutabik dilli mumbai or bangalore jaise shaharon main chaar sadasyon vaale kisi parivaar kaa masik kharch agar 3860 rupee he to wo use bhi garib nahin mana jayega
 Protest has also started regarding this new definition of poverty line
 kai saamaajik sanghathanon kaa kahana he ki ye desh main garibon kii sankhya kam dikhaane kii ek sajeesh he

 On 27 January 2014, when Rahul Gandhi gave his first TV interview to a private news channel, many questions were raised about his interview
 rahul ke aatmavishvaas par sawaal uthe the
 It was also said that Rahul Gandhi was not directly answering the question
 yah sach tha
 There was a lack of confidence in that interview of Rahul Gandhi but it was a big thing that Rahul Gandhi had to face that interview for about 80 minutes
 har sawaal kaa jawaab dene kii koshish kii
 When people from all over the world have their eyes on a leader, including the opposition, it was no small matter to face questions for 80 minutes
 sabase badi baat yah bhi thi ki us samay desh main loksabhaa chunaav bhi hone vaale the to rahul ke is intervyuu kaa kai myne bhi the
 a wrong answer could mean an impact on elections
 yah intervyuu rahul kii raajnneetik ruparekha bhi tay karne vaala tha
 There has been a lot of change inside Rahul Gandhi between 2014 and 2019
 is chunaav ke dauraan rahul gandhi ne kai intervyuu die hai
 On Friday, Rahul Gandhi interviewed ndtv's Ravish Kumar
 madhya pradesh ke shujalpur main yah intervyuu hua
 For the interview i was also traveling with Ravish Kumar
 ham sabake man main ek sawaal yah bhi tha ki kya rahul gandhi live intervyuu denge? samay ke mutabik rahul gandhi shujalpur pahunchate hai phir kaarykram shuru hota he
 Many big leaders including Kamal Nath were present on the stage
 meri najar rahul gandhi par thi, yah pehla mauka tha jab main rahul gandhi ko kareeb se dekh rahaa tha
 i had my eye on Rahul's gestures
 main rahul gandhi ke aatmavishvaas ko maapne main laga hua tha
 When the Congress leaders were giving speeches on the stage, Rahul Gandhi was listening intently
 jab devas ke pratyaashee padmashri prahlaad tipaania stage par kabir kaa gaanaa gane lage to rahul gandhi turant apni kursi se uth gaye or gaanaa record karne lage
 Then also uploaded this recording to his Twitter
 kai logon ko yah aam baat lagi hogi lekin jab aap gaharaai se sochenge to yah badi baat thi
 With this action, Rahul Gandhi proved that he also takes care of his worker
 padmashri prahlaad tipaania ke saath-saath vahaan baithe kaaryakartaaon kaa bhi rahul gandhi ke prati sammaan bad gaya hoga
 People sitting there must also have increased love for Rahul Gandhi
 apni spich khatm karne ke baad rahul gandhi stage se neeche utre
 Our camera was already ready
 neeche pahunchate hi rahul gandhi ne sabhi kru member se haath milaayaa phir intervyuu ke liye lagi chair ko badalakar bheed kii taraf kar diya yani rahul gandhi chaahate the ki back ground main bheed bhi dikhaai de
 Where Rahul placed his chair, it was quite sunny
 rahul gandhi se hamane poocha bhi kya dhoop se pareshaani to nahin hogi? rahul gandhi ne kaha dhoop se unhen koi samasya nahin he
 Then the interview started
 hamen bataaya gaya ki rahul gandhi sirf 20 minute intervyuu de sakate hai kyonki shujalpur ke baad unhen do or reliyon main bhi janaa tha
 It was a live interview and Rahul Gandhi also agreed to the live interview
 main khud vahiin paas main chair lagaakar baith gaya kyonki rahul gandhi ke aatmavishvaas ke saath-saath haavbhaav ko bhi main parakhnaa chahta tha
 i was also missing his 2014 interview
 mujhe yah bhi lag rahaa tha ki kahin rahul gandhi raveesh kumaar ke sawaal main funs na jaaen
 But Rahul Gandhi answered all questions with full confidence
 sawaal bhi kathin the lekin rahul dare hue nahin lag rahe the
 One thing i noticed in this interview is that Rahul Gandhi does not go around answering questions
 shaayad media ko handle karnaa wo sikh gaye hai
 Perhaps they have come to know that the more questions they turn around, the more questions will reach Rahul
 aisa laga ki rahul gandhi apane dil kii baat kah rahe hai
 Everyone knows that the alliance between BSP and Congress could not be done in Uttar Pradesh, in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan too
 mayawati bhi congress ko lekar kaaphi gusse main rahati hai
 When Ravish Kumar asked questions about Mayawati, Rahul Gandhi stated clearly that Mayawati is the symbol of the country
 mayawati congress par atake karti rahati hai lekin rahul gandhi ne mayawati ko desh kaa ek simbal bataaya
 Rahul Gandhi said that he respects Mayawati, loves her, she likes Mayawati
 rahul gandhi kaa yah bayaan ek bahut bada bayaan tha
 Rahul Gandhi said that he would never do 'vindictive' politics
 rahul gandhi ne yah bhi kaha ki aresas kii vichaardhaara ke khilaaf unki ladaai he lekin agar aresas ke saath koi anyaay ho yaa hinsa kaa prayog ho uski bhi raksha rahul gandhi karenge
 Rahul Gandhi said that this is a country of love and with love everyone's heart can be won
 piem modi ke saath unke rishte ke sawaal par rahul gandhi thodi der ke liye sochane lage phir bole ki piem modi vyaktigat rup main ghrinaa bhav rakhte hai
 Rahul Gandhi also said that he learns from Modi, also takes note of the question that is raised on him and often finds himself lacking, then tries to fill that gap
 neshnal herald par bhi sawaal kaaphi kathin tha
 When Ravish Kumar asked Rahul Gandhi that BJP says you are on bail in the National Herald Case, you have committed corruption
 mujhe laga tha rahul gandhi khud ko nirdosh bataaenge, lekin rahul gandhi kaa jawaab tha piem ko acshan lenaa chahie, inquairi karnaa chahie
 The Congress is also repeatedly raising questions about evms
 jab rahul gandhi se yah sawaal poocha gaya ki kya unki sarkaar aate hi wo iviem ko hataa denge to rahul gandhi ne kaha ki iviem ko hataanaa yaa nahin hataanaa chunaav ayog kaa kaam he
 i thought Rahul Gandhi would answer that he will remove evms when his government comes
 agar josh main rahul aisa jawaab dete to shaayad wo funs jate lekin rahul ne aisa nahin kiya
 Rahul Gandhi called Sam Pitroda's statement on the 1984 riots completely wrong
 yah bhi kaha pitroda ko aisa nahin bolnaa chahie tha
 If Rahul Gandhi were right to Pitroda's statement here, then many questions would have been asked to Rahul Gandhi, but Rahul Gandhi ended the question by saying wrong as wrong
 media ko kaise handle kiya jaae rahul gandhi sikh gaye hai
 When Ravish Kumar asked if the media also does not give much space to the voice of the opposition, Rahul Gandhi said, 'the press did not give as much space to the opposition as it should have
 rahul gandhi ne yah bhi kaha ki press unke prati anfere nahin he
 Rahul Gandhi said that sometimes the press does more but should also
 jab rahul gandhi se raveesh kumaar ne yah sawaal poocha ki log unhen 'pappu' kehete hai, majaak udaate hai to kya unhen gussa nahin aata he? rahul gandhi ne kaha ki wo sab sahi he, rahul gandhi ne kaha unhen gussa nahin balki majaa aata he
 Rahul Gandhi said journalist is my mentor
 unase wo sikhte hai
 Do not take their joke seriously
 rahul gandhi ne kaha ki unke khilaaf jahaan kuch kaha jaataa he use wo sunate he, dhyaan dete he
 Rahul Gandhi also said that he learns the most

 gujarat chunaav prachaar ke dauraan congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi sarkaar kii vifaltaaon par karaari chot ke alaava har pintara aajamaa rahe hai
 Sometimes they go to the temple, sometimes they go to the public meetings and meet people, sometimes they drink tea at the square
 yani wo janata se sidhe judaav kii har mumkin tarkeeb apanaate dikh rahe hai
 On Friday, the same form of Rahul was seen in Ahmedabad
 shiksha jagat ke logon ke saath baatcheet ke dauraan anshkaleen mahila vyaakhyaata kii durdasha sunakar congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi bhavuk ho gaye or unhen gale se laga liya
 The woman's eyes became moist as she hugged Rahul
 pehle charan se pehle chunaav prachaar ke liye rahul gandhi gujarat ke do din ke daure par hai
 During this, school teachers, professors, lecturers were invited to interact with Rahul Gandhi
 isi main mahila vyaakhyaata ranjana avasthi bhi ai thim jinhone apni rahul ko apni pareshaaniyaan bayaan kin
 Micaj given to the woman When Rahul completed his talk from the stage, Ranjana Awasthi was given the mic
 mike milte hi unhone apni vyathaa bayaan kii
 Ranjana, who is nearing retirement, asked Rahul about the Congress' plan to deal with the problems faced by the teachers when the party came to power
 baari dil se ranjana ne kaha, 'maine 1994 main sanskrit se piechdi kiya he
 Since that time we have been living in very poor condition
 anshkaleen seva ke 22 saal biit jane ke baavjood hamaara vetan keval 12 hajaar rupaya prati maheenaa he
 We are not given maternity leave
 'ranjana avasthi ne rahul ke saamne rote hue kaha, 'ab koi aashaa nahin he
 Only we know what kind of struggle we have fought and what kind of pain we have gone through
 'rahul milane pahunchemhila kaa dard sunakar rahul unke paas pahunch gaye
 As soon as Rahul reached there, the woman became emotional with folded hands
 rahul ne unhen bharosa dilaayaa
 After this, hugged them and gave them courage
 manch se rahul ne vaada kiya ki unki sarkaar aane ke baad is vyavastha ko badla jayega
 The crown of Miss Turkey has been snatched this year due to a tweet from beauty queen Etir Essen, who named her the crown of Miss Turkey
 bibisi ne shuukravaar ko bataaya ki 18 saal kii itir asen ne pichley saal hue takhta palat ke prayaas ke sandarbh main apane masik dharm ke khun kii tulana 'shaheedon' ke khun se kar di thi
 The organizers of the competition said that such a tweet was 'unacceptable' and confirmed their decision to take away the crown just hours after their victory
 beauty queen monica kii luteron ne goli markar kii hatyaesen ne instagram ke jariye kaha ki vah raajnneetik nahin hai or na raajnneeti kar rahi thim
 The tweet was made on July 15, around the first anniversary of the coup attempt
 lagbhag 250 log takhpalat kii koshish karne vaale sainikon se ladate hue maare gaye the
 Nearly 150,000 government employees were laid off after the Turkish uprising last year
 itir ne likhaa tha, '15 july kaa shahid diwas manaane ke liye aaj subah mujhe masik dharm aa gaya
 i symbolically celebrate this day by shedding the blood of our martyrs
 'turki ke raashtrapati takhtapalat ke virodh ke dauraan maare gaye logon kaa zikr niyamit rup se shahid ke rup main karte hai
 Organizers of Miss Turkey Beauty Contest said that the tweet was not known until the contest was held in Istanbul on Thursday
 iskaa pataa chalane ke baad der tak chali ek baithak main charchaa ke baad or post kii pushti hone ke baad asen se miss turki kaa khitaab waapas lene kaa faisla kiya gaya
 The organizers issued a statement in reference to the decision on Friday, saying, 'we regret to say that this tweet was done by Etir Essen
 miss turki sanghathan dwaara aise post ko badhaava dena sambhav nahin he, is sanghathan kaa makasad turki ko duniya se parichit karana or isaki chhavi main yogadan dena he
 Essen apologized, saying he had been misunderstood
 unhone soshal media par apni pratikriya main kaha, 'main kahana chaahati hum ki ek 18 saal kii ladki ke rup main is post ko saajha karne ke peeche meraa koi raajnneetik makasad nahin tha
 i have grown up with a learning to respect our motherland and nation

 Around that time, President Erdogan launched thousands of lawsuits against those who insulted him

 However, there is still a drastic action in the country Turkey regarding any such post and action

 On this, the President says that it is necessary to do this for national security

 com / wxszwa1odo If there is no love in a relationship, then it does not matter whether it is there or not
 kisi bhi rishte ko banaae rakhane ke liye pyaar hona bahut jaruri he
 In many relationships there comes a time when everything seems to be wrong
 aapako dekhnaa or aapke saath rahanaa na to aapke partner ko pasand aata he or na hi aapako
 If your relationship has also reached such a point, then it means that there is nothing left in your relationship now and it has remained just a sham
 agar aap vaaki apane sambandhon ko sudhaarna chaahate hai to sabase pehle uske kaarnon ko samajhane kii koshish karen
 You can make the relationship stand again with your efforts but it is not your alone to take it forward
 iske liye aap donon ko hi prayaas karne kii jarurat hogi
 If your partner does not support you, then you cannot do anything on your own
 par sabase jaruri baat ye he ki aapako sahi samay par ye pataa chal jaae ki aapkaa rishta ek najuk mukaam par pahunch chukaa he
 If you also see these symptoms, then understand that your relationship is in danger: 1
 kya aapako is rishte or apane partner se judi har cheez ab buree hi lagati he? kya aapako is rishte main ab koi interest nahin rah gaya? kya ab aapako pyaar bhari baaten wo khushi nahin deteen jo pehle diya karti thim? agar aapako bhi kuch aisa hi mahasoos hone laga he to aapkaa rishta khatre main he
 2
 kya aap har cheez se ub chuke hai?kya jin baton se aap pehle khush ho jaaya karte the vahi ab aapako boring laganelgi hai? kahin aapako bhi to aisa nahin lagane laga he ki aapke rishte main kuch kho sa gaya he?3
 Is it not happening to you somewhere that whenever you are with your partner, you feel suffocated? Are you wasting your time by meeting him like this? If you are dealing with these things from anywhere, then assume that your relationship is on the verge of ending

 The move has been defended by Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley amid opposition from opposition parties to present the general budget ahead of the assembly elections to be held in five states of the country

 He says, 'interim elections are presented just before the Lok Sabha elections
 kisi ne use to nahin roka
 In 2014 too, an interim budget was presented just days before the general election
 yah ek sanvaidhanik jarurat he
 'let us tell you that keeping in mind to start spending on public welfare schemes from the first day of the next financial year, the central government has decided to present the general budget on February 1 this year by ending the old practice of presenting the budget on the last day of February

 In such a situation, various political parties knocked over President Pranab Mukherjee and Election Commission against the decision of presenting the general budget on 1 February
 kanges, left, sapa or basapa jaisi partiyon ne is kadam ko lekar aapattiyaan jataai hai
 They believe that voters can be influenced by making populist announcements in this budget
 haalanki arun jetali kaa kahana he ki aam bajet ko pehle pesh karne kaa ek makasad vibhinn madon main kharche ko jald shuru karnaa he, kyonki isse pehle ke varshon main yah monsooni maheene ke baad hi shuru ho paata tha
 He said, 'these actual expenses should start in April before the start of monsoon instead of half a year has passed
 centre ke is kadam kaa asal makasad yahi he or ham us par adig hai
 On the question asked to remove the ban on cash withdrawal from banks and atms after demonetisation, Finance Minister Jaitley refused to intervene in the matter and said that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will take stock of the market situation
 Later it will take a decision on lifting the ban

 a case related to religion has once again come to light with online food service website Zomato
 ek graahak ne jomato ke delivery boy se sirf isliye khaanaa nahin liya kyonki vah muslim tha
 But now this person has been given a befitting reply from Jomato

 Jomato wrote that there is no religion to eat, food itself is a religion
 iske alaava deependra goyal ne twitor par likhaa ki ham bharat ke vichaaron or hamaare graahakon-partneron kii vividhta par garv karte hai
 If there is any kind of loss to our business due to these values, we will not feel sad for it
 Food doesn’t have a religion

 bollywood diarector, produsar or mujeec compoger vishaal bharadwaj (vishal Bhardwaj) us samay khud ko twit karne se nahin roak paae jab pradhanmantri narendra modi (PM Narendra Modi) ne 'saraab' ko 'sharaab' kaha, or twitor par ye trend ban gaya
 Vishal Bhardwaj, who has given memorable films like 'spider', 'kaminey', 'omkara' and 'maqbool', has shared the lion of the famous poet Mir Taki Mir on Twitter and advised that 'sarab' is given as 'alcohol' Say no
 vaise bhi in donon hi shabdon ke myne ekadam alag hai
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi (PM Narendra Modi) made 'sarab' with the initials of SP (SP), BSP (BSP) and RLD (RLD) during his rally
 hasti apni habaab kii si he This exhibition is like a bridge
 mir taqi mir
 Do not read alcohol to Sarab:) Bollywood director Vishal Bhardwaj wrote on his Twitter account: Hasti is like his power
 ye numaaish saraab kii si he
 -mir Takhi Mir
 saraab ko sharaab naa padhe naa bolen
 
 
 In this way Vishal Bhardwaj has taken note of the misuse of words with great beauty, as well as he has taken a stance in light-hearted manner
 pradhanmantri narendra modi (PM Narendra Modi) ne apane bhaashan ke dauraan sapa, basapa or ralod ko 'saraab' bataaya tha or janata se kaha tha ki unase dur rahane kii jarurat he
 Anyway, the atmosphere is very hot for the Lok Sabha Elections 2019, and every party is campaigning very aggressively
 vishaal bharadwaj ko ek alag hi dhang kaa cinema banane ke liye pahachaanaa jaataa he or ve bahut hi shandaar mujeec bhi compoj karte hai
 Vishal Bhardwaj has made films like 'spider' and 'blue Umbrella' for children
 iske saath hi unki 'haidar', 'saat khun maaf' or 'ishkia' bhi lokapriy filmein hai
 Vishal Bhardwaj, 53, hails from Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh

 # Amritsar # trainaccident bhrashtachar ke maamalon main jaanch ke liye ek swatantra sanstha lokapal ke gathan kaa intjaar khatm ho gaya he
 Former Supreme Court judge Justice Pinaki Chandra Ghosh (PC Ghosh) is going to become the first Lokpal of the country
 bhrashtachar ke khilaaf andolan se niklaa lokapal kanoon upie-2 kii sarkaar ke aakhri dinon main paas hua or 5 saal baad endie sarkaar ke aakhri dinon main lokapal kii niyukti kaa rasta saaf hua
 But with the formation of the institution, questions have also arisen regarding the appointment and credibility of the Lokpal
 lokapal andolan kaa hissaa rahe varisht vakil prashanth bhushan ne aajtak
 Talking to in said that the government delayed the appointment for 5 years
 uske baad chayan prakriya se vipaksh ko hataa diya
 Prashant Bhushan is also a petitioner in the Supreme Court in the Rafale case, in response to the question whether he will lodge a complaint in the Rafale case in the Lokpal, Prashant Bhushan said, "made a person whose credibility is already under suspicion" 
 tamilnadu kii purv mukhyamantri jayalalita ke maamle main pehle to wo maheenon baithe rahen
 Then ruled after Jayalalithaa's death
 iske alaava purv justise bhattacharya bhi justise pisi ghosh ko lekar kaaphi talkh tippanee kar chuke he'
 Aajtak of social activist Anjali Bhardwaj who has been a part of mass movements for long time for transparency and accountability
 in se baatcheet main kahana he ki bhrashtachar par ankush lagane ke liye lambey samay se lokapal jaisi swatantra or shashakt sanstha kii aavashyaktaa thi
 It was then decided that an independent person would be made Lokpal
 lekin lokapal ke chayan main antat: sarkaar kii hi chali
 According to the law, the Lokpal has to be selected by a five-member committee
 jisamen pradhanmantri, loksabhaa adhyaksh, vipaksh ke netaa, mukhya nyaayadhish yaa unke dwaara bheje gaye pratinidhi milakar ek prakhyat kanoonvid kaa chayan karte hai
 This five-member committee then selects the Lokpal
 lekin loksabhaa main paryaapt sankhyabal naa hone kii vajah se congress ko vipakshi dal ke taur par manyata nahin di gai or loksabhaa main congress ke netaa mallikarjun khadge ko special invity ke taur par bulaayaa gaya
 Because of which he refused to come to the meeting
 anjali bharadwaj kaa kahana he ki vipakshi dal kii gaiyr maujuudagi main prakhyat kanoonvid chunane ke liye panel kii sankhya 3 hi rah gai
 In which the government got a majority due to the Prime Minister and the Speaker of the Lok Sabha
 is teen sadasyeey panel ne kanoonvid ke taur par purv atorni general mukul rohtagi ko chunaa, jo maujuuda sarkaar ke kareebi maane jate hai
 In this context, in the absence of Kharge in the selection of Lokpal, it was the government and it became a government committee
 anjali kaa kahana he ki unhone kai dfa soochna ke adhikaar kanoon ke jariye lokapal chayan prakriya ke bare main poocha lekin unhen soochna dene se inkaar kar diya gaya
 This shows that there was no transparency in selection
 jo sabase bada sawaal he
 Even before it is formed, the trust in the institution has been shocked
 agar satta main rahane vaale dal bijepi or congress ko hi lokapal kii niyukti kerani thi to bhrashtachar kii jaanch ke liye sivisi or sibiai to pehle se hi he
 The Lokpal has been given a lot of powers in the law
 lokapal ko piem se lekar sabhi sarkari adhikariyon kii jaanch kaa puraa adhikaar he
 The Lokpal will have to conduct a preliminary inquiry within 30 days of receiving the complaint
 jisaki avadhi badhaakar 3 maheene kii ja sakati he
 So the investigation will have to be completed within 6 months which can be extended for 6 more months
 kul milakar 1 saal main jaanch puri kerani hogi
 In this context, investigation into corruption cases that have been stuck for a long time will accelerate
 lekin anjali bharadwaj kaa kahana he ki yah tab sambhav he jab lokapal sahi tareeke se kaam kare
 The central government has decided in 2018 through an amendment to the Prevention of Corruption Act that investigations and inquiries will not be allowed without the government's permission
 aise main sarkaar apane hi khilaaf jaanch kii anumati kyon degi?haal main charchaa main rahe bank dhokhadhadi maamle, rafel sauda or sahaara birla diary ko lekar anjali bharadwaj kaa kahana he ki agar lokapal hote to vahi in maamalon kii jaanch karte
 But the government did not first appoint Lokpal for 5 years and also appointed it at a time when the notification of general elections has been issued
 jab itnaa intjaar kar liya to chand maheene baad jab nai sarkaar aati to use hi lokapal kaa chayan karne diya hota
 In such a situation, appointing Lokpal without going transparency is tarnishing the name of a holy institution
 asia cap romaanchak daur main pahunch gaya he
 Bangladesh and Sri Lanka are scheduled to clash on Tuesday, which the hosts can win and play the final
 srilanka agar bangladesh ko haraa detaa he to phir bharat kaa final khelnaa tay hoga lekin srilanka agar yah match haar jaataa he to bharat final kii daud se baahar ho jayega
 Pakistan has already reached the final
 pakistan ke nau ank hai or vah talika main sabase upar he
 He scored a bonus point against Sri Lanka
 pehle match main usne bangladesh ko haraaya tha lekin bharat se use haar mili
 Despite this, he has reached the finals
 bharat ne pehle match main srilanka ko haraaya tha lekin shuukravaar ko sachin ke sauven shatak ke baavjood use bangladesh se haar mili thi
 The defeat gave a shock to India's chances of reaching the final, but after defeating Pakistan, the Indian team has maintained the possibility of remaining in this race
 srilanka agar bangladesh ko haraa detaa ho to phir bharat kaa final khelnaa tay hoga lekin srilanka agar yah match haar jaataa he to bharat final kii daud se baahar ho jayega
 In such a situation, India and Bangladesh will get eight points each but due to the defeat at the hands of Bangladesh, India will be disappointed despite the better net run rate
 bangladesh is aitihaasik pal ke liye purajor koshish karegaa kyonki bharat ko haraane ke baad uske hausale buland hai
 There is a lot of difference between Bangladesh and Sri Lanka in terms of talent, experience and stamina, but the poor position of the Sri Lankan team going through a bad phase can inspire Bangladesh to victory
 pakistani khilaadi jahaan is match ke parinaam se bekhbar final kii taiyaari kar rahe honge, vahiin bhartiya team badi besabri se is match ke parinaam kaa intjaar karegi
 The Indian team will be nothing less than Bangladesh's defeat
 is tarah ke halaat austrailia main kheli gai trikoniya shrinkhalaa ke dauraan bhi upje the, jab bharat ko final main pahunchane ke liye austrailia ke haathon srilanka kii haar ke liye prarthana kerani padi thi
 The comments bangladeshi team bonus hasil karne ke liye ek baar phir apane ballebaajon par ashrith hogi
 Tamim Iqbal, Zahurul Islam, Nasir Hussain, Saqib al-hussein and Mushfiqur Rahim were the batsmen against India
 srilanka ke khilaaf haalanki in ballebaajon ko kaaphi dikkat kaa saamana karnaa pad saktaa he kyonki uski akraman pankti bharat se behatar he
 For Sri Lanka, this match will be a means of saving prestige as it will be a shame for the former world winner Sri Lanka to prove laggards out of the four teams playing in Asia and would like to avoid this situation by winning the match under any circumstances

 Consultation of teacher faculty plays an important role in this direction
 kai sankaay sadsy apane shodh ko ucch takanic start ap main parivartit karne main safal rahe hai
 Changing a mindset that does not share information with anyone, creating a culture of interdisciplinary collaboration, and an initiative by the institute to encourage collective efforts have also played a big role in this change
 shauchalay se lekar upgrah nirmaan tak, bharat ke saamne har kshetra main chunautiyaan munh baae khadi hai or donon ko aise ucch takanic ke sahyog kii jarurat he jiskaa janm or paalan-poshan apni hi dharti par hua ho
 Many of these solutions, developed to suit Indian conditions, can help solve similar problems of more than 90 countries other than India whose economic and social conditions are very similar to India
 iity ne bhi yah samajhnaa shuru kar diya he ki use apane paathyakramon main manviki or saamaajik vigyaan ko zyada mahatv dene kii jarurat he
 iit-delhi Department of Humanities and Social Sciences is one of the best departments in the country on this subject
 hamaare sansthaanon ne yah bhi mahasoos kiya he ki hamaare snaatakon ko ejineering ke kshetra kii sari baarikiyaan sikhaane ke saath-saath unamem majboot saamaajik mulyon or naitikta ko sthapit karnaa bhi utana hi jaruri he
 Engineering devoid of empathy is exactly the same as a brain devoid of subconsciousness
 haal hi main maanav sansaadhan vibhaag dwaara shuru kiya gaya kaarykram unnat bharat abhiyaan (ubie) kaa uddeshy hamaare ucchtam shikshan sansthaanon ko gramin kshetron kii chunautiyon se jude shodh ke liye protsaahit karne kii disha main ek acha kadam he
 While the start up culture in these institutions is primarily a result of the effort of undergraduate students, the 25,000 researchers registered in our higher educational institutions also need to be encouraged to engage with entrepreneurship and pursue it
 vaishvikaran: aaj iity main padhgaye vaale chaatro main se maatr ek pratishat chaatr videshi hai
 There is so much demand for IIT studies in the country that IIT never looked abroad for the students nor did it change its admission process to make it suitable for foreign students
 is kaaran hamaare chaatr, videshon ke sheersh vishvavidhyalayon main jaisi saanskrithik vividhta pai jaati he usase vanchit rah gaye
 It is also affecting iit's ratings globally
 ab pichley kuch saal se pehali baar iity kii do pramukh pravesh parikshaayen—joint entrens exam (jeii) or graduate aptitude test in ejineering (get) kaa aayojan vaishvik str par hona shuru hua he
 These examinations are now being conducted in many countries
 maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantralay dwaara haal hi main launch study in india program se hamaare parisaron main saanskrithik vividhta main bada antar aane kii bhi ummid jataai ja rahi he
 The target is to have at least 10 percent of the students in every campus being from abroad
 agle kuch saal main is lakshya ko hasil karne kii disha main gambhirtha se prayaas kiye ja rahe hai
 Recently, the Ministry has also simplified the norms related to giving teachers (faculty) from other countries a chance in IIT
 iity is tarah se kuch sankayon main jo riktiyaan hai unhen videshi shikshakon ke dwaara bharne kii icchhuk he
 Learn anywhere, anytime: IIT has taken online education very seriously
 udhaaharan ke liye, maanav sansaadhan mantralay dwaara vittposhit online shikshan kaarykram neshnal program on technology anhansed larning (enpitiiel) program or mysive open online course (emoosi) ke jariye online training ne ek nai oonchai hasil kii he
 The NPTEL courses in which teachers from IIT and the Indian Institute of Science teach are now available on youtube and are not seen by people around the world as much as the content of any other educational institution
 mantralay dwaara vitt poshit iity-dilli kii abhaasi prayogshaala (virtual lab) deshbhar ke kai sansthaanon ke vidhyaarthiyon ko aadhunik prayogshaalaon se vyaavhaarik rup main parichit karaane main madadgaar sabit ho rahi he
 We are going through a period where teaching-training needs to be made interesting
 aaj jo vidhyaarthee hamaare campus main pravesh le rahe hai ve 2070 ke aasapaas apane kariyar se sevanivritti le rahe honge
 Even after teaching them well, no one can predict exactly how their future will be
 ek dashak purv kisi ne bhi yah sochaa nahin hoga ki google marcides or bmdablyoo ke saath muqabla kar rahaa hoga or aipal rolex jaise bade paaramparik ghadi nirmaataaon ke saamne chunauti pesh kar rahaa hoga
 The feeling of learning over the life and the sense of always keeping your skills up to date is going to be very important
 hamen apane vidhyaarthiyon ko moulik chijen achche se sikhaakar unki buniyaad majboot karne ke baad unhen yah bhi sikhaane kii jarurat he ki unhen kaise jeevanabhar seekhney ko tatpar rahanaa hoga
 Research and Development Institute: Good quality research is being done in our educational institutions
 udhaaharan ke liye, cues uniwarsity ranking ke anusaar, iity-dilli ko shodh prabhaavon ke lihaaj se duniyabar ke sansthaanon main 28wein sthaan par rakhaa gaya he
 Every year some of our major iits are worth Rs 400 crore
 se upar ke pryojit shodh va vikaas kaary apane haathon main lete hai
 The top IIT colleges have more graduate (PG) students than graduates
 haalia cues ranking main zyaadaatar pramukh iity vibhaagon ko vishwa ke 100 chotii ke vibhaagon main sthaan mila he
 Institutions like iit-delhi are filing more than 100 patents every year and thus creating valuable intellectual property for the country
 baharhaal in sansthaanon ne lakshya rakhaa he ki ve apane shodh ko adhik se adhik praasangik or vishay aadhaarit banaaenge
 The results of our research and development are of a very high level but we lag behind in putting them on the practical plane
 lagaataar badalati shodh samskruti ko majboot karnaa or samaaj ko takanic tathaa utpaadon kaa laabh pradaan karnaa hamaare sansthaanon ke liye bahut mahatvapurn ho gaya he
 The technology park will play a very important role by partnering with industries in our campuses as has been done at iit-madras
 kai puraane iity apane parisaron main bade technology park kaa nirmaan kar rahe hai
 Changes in funding pattern: Older IIT colleges get about Rs 1,000 crore annually for their activities
 kii jarurat hoti he
 Since this year, the government has arranged loans for the construction of infrastructure through the Higher Education Financing Agency (HEFA)
 sansthaanon ko yah rin 10 saal main chukaana hoga jabaki iskaa byaaj sarkaar bharegi
 While this model has many advantages and drawbacks as well, it has now become necessary for our top institutions to repair their internal finances so that they can repay the loans on time
 isliye aisi sambhaavna jataai ja rahi he ki iity main ab nirantar shiksha kaarykram, pryojit snatakottar kaarykram, ucch mulya ke udyog paraamarsh, purv chaatro dwaara dhan jamaa karne vaali pahal, pryojit aar and di vagairah par overhead shulk badhotaree jaise upayon se zyada rajasav jamaa karne kii pravriti shuru hogi
 Higher educational institutions of the country are undergoing a massive transformation
 aisi aashaa he ki agle 5-10 varshon main, ye santhaan desh ke andar praudyogikiyon kaa vikaas karke na sirf saarvajanik jivan main bade badlaav laa sakenge balki vishwastar ke bade khilaadi bhi ban jaaenge
 While India has already been a global player in information technology, if there is enough emphasis on intensive technical entrepreneurship programs in our higher educational institutions, then the country seems to have the potential to become the leader in the field of technology
 is parivartan main hamen hamaare ucch takneekee sansthaanon kii bhoomika ko kam karke nahin aankna chahie
 These institutions need to be included and nurtured in nation building
 yah jimmedaari keval maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantralay kii nahin he
 Every ministry, every industry in the country will have to add them in their efforts for excellence

 When a foreign guest comes to India, he wants to see the Taj Mahal
 agar wo mehmaan koi shasnadhyaksh ho to taj ke aasapaas based tajganj vaasiyon ke liye musiibat kaa sabab ban jaataa he
 These thousands of people are held hostage for a day
 almerica ke raashtrapati baraak obama bharata rahe hai
 Guest Nawaji's preparations are in full swing
 lekin sabase ahm he obama kii suraksha
 For which, the security agencies of India and America have been exercising for two months
 dilli ke alaava obama apni begum ke saath tajmahal kaa didaar karne ke liye agra jaaenge
 Therefore, after Delhi, the highest security arrangements are being made in Agra
 tajmahal kii suraksha ke teen ghere hai
 The external security of the Taj is the responsibility of the local police but the internal security is with the CISF
 taj main pravesh karne ke liye teen get hai
 There is always a tight security here
 inhen ke paas se hokar jaataa he tajganj ke bheetar jane kaa rasta
 Whenever a Head of Government comes here, these paths are closed since morning
 yani tajganj vaasi apane ilaake main kaid
 If this VIP is from America or Europe then more trouble
 obama ke maamle main to paabandiyaan itani kadi hai ki log apane hi ghar kii chat par nahin ja sakenge
 Now if a tourist has stayed in the hotel in this area then the same restriction will be applicable for him
 tajganj kii dukaane or showrooms aadi bhi band rakhe jane kii yojana he
 Apart from Tajganj, Dussehra Ghat ancient temple, Hazrat Ahmad Bukhari's Dargah, Ahmed Bukhari Cemetery, Rajiv Nagar, Vasudev Colony, Forrest Colony, Jalma Lepros Ashram, Village Nagla Paima, Garhi Bangaj and Nagla Kalfi will also remain closed
 in ilaakon me jane ke liye koi or vaikalpik maarg bhi nahin he
 In such a situation, about 15 thousand people living in and around Tajganj will face detention
 tajganj ke logon ne apni is pareshaani ko lekar kai baar dharna, pradarshan tak kiye
 Since the Taj Mahal is World Heritage, the matter reached the Supreme Court
 uski ek monitering cameti ne jila prashasan ko tajganj ke liye vaikalpik maarg dene yaa phir vahaan ke logon ko duusari jagah shift kiye jane jaise prastaav bheje
 But even after years passed, the administration did not seriously work on any of these options
 bijepi netaa mukhtaar abbaas nakvi ne uttar pradesh or bihar main hue upachunaav main bhaajapa kii haar ko lekar bayaan diya he
 He said that whether the election is small or big, the opposition should be happy in that

 It will hurt them
 nakvi ne kaha ki upachunaav mensamajawaadee partybahujan samaaj party ke saath milakar chunaav jiti he
 Congratulations to them, but it should also be understood that under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, we have continuously formed our government in the states
 yah narendra modi ke netritv main vikaas or vishwaas ke chalate ho paaya he
 Naqvi said that when Narendra Modi became the Prime Minister of the country, at that time he did not bring the government of 22 states in his legacy
 aaj desh ke 90 se 95 fisadi tak ke kshetra main bhartiya janata party kii sarkaar he
 He said, its only message is that we believe in good governance

 Despite this, she only talks about options and sees herself as an alternative
 nakvi ne kaha ki thake haare netaa kyon galatfahami paal rahe hai, iskaa unako koi phayda nahin hone vaala he
 BJP needs to change its strategy: BJP leader Subramanian Swamy said that we should take this defeat seriously
 is par vishleshan hona chahie
 This should be pondered in the party
 unhone kaha ki 2014 main ham teen baton par chunaav jite the, ek to hindutv ko leker tha
 The second was to eliminate corruption and the third was the stature of Narendra Modi
 swami ne kaha ki aage thodaa or kaam karne kii jarurat he
 There was a lot of delay in corruption but BJP has started work
 unhone kaha ki vipaksh kitna bhi bada gathbandhan banaae lekin abhi tak bijepi ke upar ek bhi bhrashtachar kaa aarope nahin laga paae
 Harusubramanian Swamy of BJP, who was not on the agenda of Hindutva, said that when the BJP won the general elections in 2014, at that time he had many important agenda which had Hindutva agenda on top
 saath hi bhrashtachar ko lekar bhi jis tareeke se bijepi ne kaam kiya us par bhi vah aage bad rahe the
 But now BJP will have to see where they have missed and they will also have to review it
 ahamkaari bijepi ko janata ne sabak sikhayaargedy netaa jai prakaash yadav ne kaha ki bihar or uttar pradesh keupachunaavamein ahamkaari bhaajapa ko janata ne sabak sikhaa diya he
 Now the Prime Minister's graph is seen falling
 bihar main lalu ji kii lahar chali he
 The Rashtriya Janata Dal has won a landslide victory in the by-election
 unhone kaha ki uttar pradesh main mayawati or akhilesh ji ke gathbandhan ke saath bhartiya janata party kii ulti ginati shuru ho gai he
 The country has to be saved and the BJP has to be removed

 Also, like-minded people should strengthen Rahul Gandhi's hands with force

 View this post on instagramthat's what you do when cancer shows up
 You show it the way out! It is a tough phase to be in, but then i would have never known my own strength, which is inherent in each one of us, and which we come to know off when tested
 Like i said before, let's choose to be the heroes of our own drama of life
 i strongly believe if an obstacle comes in your life it is for you to deal with it, overcome it, beat the shit out of it and become a better version of yourself, which could be a bit worn out but would be experienced, a bit tattered but more wise, a bit left out but more to bring forth, a bit handicapped but better equipped! So now the upgraded version of myself is dealing with cancer stage 1 a, which is still a result of early detection
 I'll be going through 12 sessions of chemotherapy
 6 down, and another 6 left
 Hence the cap look nowadays😁 This post is dedicated to my journey where half the battle is won and the other half i want to fight with each of you who is enduring it
 Be resilient, be strong, we shall overcome and how! Also i have immense gratitude for people around me who have taken it in the right spirit and didn’t give up on me
 Personally i owe it to my best friend @ komal20to77 husband @ayushmannk parents @ kashyap6480 @yajankashyap
 This bit is taken for granted but when professionally you are supported and still look dependable your resilience to fight becomes stronger
 For this i owe it to @atulkasbekar @tanuj
 garg @findingshanti @shrutiv11 who too were shocked when they heard the news but didn’t give up and still lay bet on this bruised but not broken horse
