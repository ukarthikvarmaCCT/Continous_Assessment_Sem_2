 vahi arunima sinha, jinhen badmaashon ne lut kaa virodh karne par chalati train se neeche phenk diya tha
 Arunima made history in 2013 by beating Everest, the world's highest peak, in 2013, two years after the incident in 2011
 arunima nesahitya ajtakake everest se bhi ooncha satr main everest fatah karne kii kahani ke saath hi haadase kaa manjar bhi bayaan kiya
 Recalling the incident, Arunima said that the incident was the U-turn of my life
 tab main ek job ke liye intervyuu dene dilli ja rahi thi
 Then some people in the train started looting
 maine apni chen chhinane se manaa kiya, hathapayee hui or badmaashon ne train se neeche phenk diya
 He said that one leg was cut, swinging in the jeans while the broken bones of the other were coming out of the jeans
 ek ke baad ek kai trainen pair se upar se guzar gayi
 Twilight was also falling around, splattering too, i kept trying to get up but failed
 subah graminon nhospatalapahunchaaya
 Arunima said the hospital did not have anesthesia and oxygen
 dekh nahin paa rahi thi, lekin doctoron kii baat sunakar bin anaesthesia ke hi pair kaatane ko kaha kyonki pen bahut zyada ho rahaa tha
 The doctors did the same
 doctoron ne vah sabhi kiya, jo vah kar sakate the
 He told that the pharmacist BC Yadav gave his blood
 tab tak yah maamla media main aa gaya or mujhe king jorge medical college se dilli ames laayaa gaya
 Arunima said that the people in the hospital were more worried due to my leg being amputated
 tab kaaphi controvarsi bhi hui ki suicide ke liye gai, titi aayaa to tikat nahin tha isliye kud gai aadi
 He said then left at all times and decided that i have to conquer Everest
 doctor bhi kehete hai ki stick ke sahare chalanaa seekhney main 4-5 saal lag jate hai, maine do saal main yah kar dikhaaya
 Arunimane said that the doctor used to say, come with a stick, take a wheelchair, but i had decided that i do not have to sit in a wheelchair
 deevaaron ke sahare aath maheene main chalanaa siikhaa
 Hearing about going to Everest, people used to say that Madunarunima said that people fit in climbing Everest also used to fail
 meraa erak pair nahin doosraa tha bhi to move nahin kar rahaa tha
 In such a situation, people used to speak crazy on hearing of going to Everest with artificial legs
 meri maa ne meraa saport kiya or sponcer na milane kii sthiti main kaha ki iske liye vah apana ghar bhi bech dengi
 As soon as he was discharged from the hospital, he did not go home, went directly to Bachendri Pal's office
 unhone us pal ko yaad karte hue bataaya ki tab mere pairon se khun nikal rahaa tha
 Bachendriji asked what i said that the girl who is coming on TV these days, whose legs are cut, i am the same girl
 maine jab apana prapojal bataaya to unki ankhon main bhi aansu aa gaye or unhone kaha ki apane andar ke everest par tumne fatah kar liya he, ab to basduniyaako dikhaane ke liye everest fatah karnaa he
 They supported me

 Arunima also faced difficulty in climbing Everest said that during training, we had to climb a suntop with a height of 30 to 35 kg at a height of 14 thousand feet, initially it could not even climb
 waapas ai or khud se vaada kiya ki suryatop par janaa he
 Then the next time the peak was 20 minutes ago
 anya logon ne puche ki aap khate kya ho
 He told that when he reached Kathmandu to go to Everest, Sherpa said that it cannot go
 kam taapmaana main pair crack ho jayega, lekin nahin maani
 Arunima said that Everest also encountered many difficulties
 rocky aria best chali, green blue pahunch pair slip ho jaataa tha
 Had to hit the tow, the tow would have hit the hill
 sherpa bole chalegi kaise
 She went up after hitting the tow five times
 unhone kaha ki meraa artificial pair duniya kii najar main artificial tha, meri najar main nahin
 Everest had become the dream of the country of Fateh, Arunima said that it was slower than other people
 balakani aria main oxigen kam ho rahaa tha, tab sherpa ne waapas chalane ko kaha
 He was getting angry
 unhone bataaya ki tab sherpa se kaha ki tum jaao yaa na jaao, mujhe janaa he
 The way that no one can get there
 raste main 90 ke dashak kii ded body padi thim
 The Everest winner told that a Bangladeshi died in my rope
 use cross kar aage badhin or pairphislagaya to usee body par aakar ruki
 He said that it was only my dream to climb Everest at first, but when it reached there, it had become the dream of the whole country
 le gai thi vivekanand kii tasvirrunima ne bataaya ki vah apane saath apane aadhyatmik guru swami vivekanand kii tasviir le gai thim or camere bhi
 When he reached the peak and took out the camera and asked to take a photo with Sherpa, he got angry
 unhone bataaya ki oxigen kam tha, sherpa ko bhi pataa tha ki itane oxigen main camp-4 tak bhi nahin pahunch sakati
 He took the photo, but when he asked to make a video, he slammed the camera
 unhone bataaya ki jinda bachuungi yaa nahin, video se yuvaaon ko prerana milegi, yah sochakar video banwaaya tha
 Everest Arunima said that Everest conquered through heart and mind, not with legs, but with hearts
 kisi bhi lakshya ko paane ke liye jarurat soch, gol or focus kii hoti he
 He then shared his memories of conquering other mountain peaks

 Vinata did not initially name Aloknath, but later he also named the actor and made many serious allegations
 vinata ne kaha tha, ''unhone mere saath shaareerik durvyavhaar kiya

 " bhartiya janata party (bijepi) kii bihar ikai ke purv adhyaksh si pi thakur ne shanivaar ko is chunavi mausam main aarakshan kaa virodh kar bihar kii raajnneeti ko garm kar diya
 Thakur said on Saturday that the reservation system in the country should end
 iske baad vipakshi dalon ne aarakshan ke mudde par bhaajapa par hamalaa shuru kar diya
 Talking to journalists in Patna, former Union Minister Thakur said that reservation was implemented in the country for 10 years, but today even after so many days of independence, reservation is in force and reservation politics is going on
 is maamle main congress ke bihar prabharee satyavrath chaturvedi ne bijepi par dalit virdohi or kamjor varg virdohi hone kaa aarope lagaate hue kaha ki congress party aarakshan ke paksh main thi, he or aage bhi rahegi
 He questioned that the BJP government was formed at the Center for six years, then why was the reservation system not abolished? idhar, bijepi ke saath gathbandhan kar loksabhaa chunaav lard rahi lok janashakti party (lojpa) ke adhyaksh ramvilas paswan se jab is maamle main patrakaron ne poocha to unhone kaha ki aise bayaan dene waalon ko aarakshan vyavastha kii sahi jaankaree nahin he
 He favored reservation, saying that reservation in government jobs and elections are separate matters
 maharashtra sarkaar ne muslim aarakshan radd kiye jane sambandhi shasnadesh jari kiya he
 The government has said that the ordinance issued by the Bombay High Court prohibiting reservation for Muslims could not take legal form, hence the earlier order related to Muslim reservation is quashed
 devendra fadanvisasarkaar ke is faisle se purv kii congress-ensipi sarkaar ko bada jhatka laga he
 The then government had announced 16 percent reservation for Marathas and five percent reservation in education and jobs to a section of Muslims
 gauratlab he ki is aarakshan ko chunauti dete hue bombai hai court main ek yachika daayar kii gai thi
 Hearing the petition, on 14 November 2014, the court had postponed the Muslim reservation along with the Maratha reservation
 lekin hai court ne musalamaanon ko shiksha ke kshetra main aarakshan dene par roak nahin lagaai thi
 The latest decision of the government said that the ordinance expired on December 2, 2014 due to the change in the law of the Muslim reservation ordinance
 shasnadesh ke jariye 24 july 2014 ke shashan ke faisle ko radd kiya jaataa he
 The special thing is that the same ordinance was issued for reservation in both jobs and education, so now after the new mandate is implemented, Muslims will not get the benefit of reservation in education also
 fadanvis sarkaar ke is shasnadesh kii congress ne aalochana kii he
 Congress Rajya Sabha member Hussain Dalwai has said that the court has also accepted that Muslim society is backward in education, so it should get reservation in education
 lekin sarkaar ke is faisle se sabit ho gaya he ki yah sarkaar sabhi ko saath lekar nahin chalanaa chaahati he
 Arjun Ranatunga, a minister in the Sri Lankan government and former captain of the cricket team, said on Monday that India would help in the investigation and legal drafting of matters related to match-fixing in his country

 CBI had accused Ranatunga and team vice-captain Arvind de Silva of match-fixing in 2000, but both were later discharged
 srilanka ne cricket main jude bhrashtachar ke maamle ujagar hone ke baad vaada kiya tha ki match phixing ke aaropon kii jaanch ke liye vishesh police ikai kaa gathan kiya jayega
 These allegations of match fixing were made in the documentary released in May

 enditivi se baatcheet main kartikeya ne is pariksha kii taiyaari kii stritegi ko vistaar se bataaya
 He told that Kartikeya used to take one to one and a half hours every day to repeat what the teacher taught
 jahaan tak subjects kii baat he, kartikeya har rosetin se chaar ghante sirf physics ko padhane main lagaate the
 Then he used to spend two to three hours in the practice of numericals

 For example, he also gave most time to Physics, Chemistry and Maths
 kartikeya ne basic book ke rup main ech si verma kii kitaab kaa istemaal kiya, chemistry main mote taur par ensiiarti ko basic risource kii tarah taiyaar kiya or maths ke liye arihant prakaashan kii kitaab
 If we go into physics, then Karthikeya says that you get a lot of time in mechanics
 11veen main shuruyaat ke chah maheene to aapke isi main nikal jate hai
 For this, you should have a good understanding of calculus, vector, coordinate geometry, etc
 iske alaava physics main aapako kynematics or thermodynamiks ko bhi achche se taiyaar karnaa chahie
 Karthikeya says that Peter Cykus is a small book, so your special time is not even gone
 inorganic main pi-block, chemical bonding ye do khaas dhyaan rakhane vaale topics hai
 If you talk about maths, in addition to Arihant Prakashan's book, he studied from SL Loni's book
 kartikeya kehete hai ki problems solve karne main kai baar aap atakaey hai, to aise main jaldi haar mat maaniye
 It will be beneficial that if you take a little more time and solve that question, then you will not only remember that process but your confidence will also increase

 In the initial investigation report of the UP police in this case, he was described as mutton

 In this context, a post on social media is viral, claiming that India is the main importer of Chinese goods and India should cease all trade with Beijing
 post main ek udhaaharan dekar bataaya gaya he ki america ne 1945 main japan ke hiroshima or nagashaki main parmaanu bam giraaya tha, isliye japan ne deshbhakti dikhaate hue america se sui tak aayaat karne se manaa kar diya
 India Today anti-fake News War Room (AFWA) found in its investigation that both these claims are false
 2018 main america ke liye japan chauthaa sabase bada niryaat bazaar tha
 In addition, India ranked seventh on the list of countries importing goods from China, with the US at number one on this list
 yah bhraamak or galat daawa 25 agast ko fasebuk pej ‘dekh Bhai’ par post kiya gaya
 The archived version of the post can be viewed
 yah post soshal media par 2017 se hi viral he or bahut se yugers ne share kii he
 AFWA found that the United States had given 120 to Japan in 2018, when the United States Trade Representative website visited AFWA
 4 billian dollar kaa niryaat kiya, jisamen vibhinn saamaan or sevaayen shaamil hai
 Whereas in the same year the United States 177
 1 billian dollar kaa aayaat bhi kiya
 If we talk about 2019, the United States Census Bureau website says that by June 2019, the US has exported nearly $ 37 billion to Japan
 post main yah bhi daawa kiya gaya he ki bharat china se aayaat karne vaala sabase bada desh he
 But Statista reports that the US is at number one in the list of importers from China
 yah china ke kul niryaat kaa 19
 India imports 2 per cent, while India's share of China's total exports is only 3
 1 fisadi he
 In this way, India is at number seven in the list of importers from China
 isliye yah daawa puri tarah galat he ki japan ne america se aayaat karnaa band kar diya he or china se aayaat karne ke maamle main bharat number ek par he

 The college is one of the 51 properties in Rajbhar that are currently on the radar of the Vigilance Department investigating corruption cases
 10 april ko ambedkarnagar kotwali main mukadmaa darj karne ke baad visilence jaanch is nattejey par pahunchi he ki bispi sarkaar main mantri pad par rahete hue rajbhar ne 10 arab 33 karod ru
 Has assets of over
 haalanki rajbhar in aaropon ko sire se khaarij karte hai
 He says, "if the charges are proved, i will retire from politics
" ’’rajbhar ek maah se visilence jaanch kii giraft main hai, lekin beeti 3 may ko jab visilence vibhaag ne party ke do kaddavar netaa rashtriya mahasachiv or vidhaan parishad main netaa pratipaksh nasimuddin siddiqui or purv urja mantri ramvir upaadhyaay par mukadmaa chalaane kii anumati sarkaar se maangi to visilence jaanch main fanse purv bispi mantriyon kaa aankada nau par pahunch gaya
 The sluggish action of the SP government on the issue of corruption on these veterans has also raised many questions
 siddiqui ke khilaaf bhrashtachar kii shikaayat karne vaale artiai activist ashish sagar dikshit kehete hai ki pichley varsh aktubar main ek iees adhikari par train main mahila se kathith chhedchhad kaa aarope lagane par sarkaar ne turant us par exiar darj karakar use nilambit kar diya
 Later in the investigation, the case turned out to be fake and the IAS was acquitted
 dikshit kehete hai, ‘‘duusari ore lokayukta ne nasimuddin siddiqui samet kai purv bispi mantriyon ko apni jaanch main bhrashtachar kaa doshi maanate hue mukadmaa darj karaane kii sanstuti kii he
 Despite this, the state government is not going to file a case and is getting Vigilance to re-examine these cases
 isse saaf he ki sarkaar in maamalon ko apane rajnatik laabh ke liye istemaal kar rahi he
 As far as the BSP is concerned, in July last year, Mayawati had hinted that she was no longer worried over the issue of corruption by handing over the responsibility of state president to former Transport Minister Rajbhar who was caught in the Lokayukta probe
 purvanchal se bispi ke ek jonal koordinator bataate hai ki mayawati samet party ke sabhi bade netaa is bare main ekamat hai ki vidhansabha chunaav se pehle bhrashtachar ke mudde par dedh darjan mantriyon ko pad se hataane kaa utana phayda nahin hua, jitna ki nuksaan
 Mayawati's action set an issue for the sitting opposition parties and the public also felt that the Mayawati government was steeped in corruption
 yahi vajah he ki agle loksabhaa chunaav ke liye mayawati un jitau ummidavaaron par daanv laga rahi hai, jo sapa sarkaar main bigadi kanoon vyavastha kaa adhiktam laabh le saken
 Even if he himself is involved in corruption cases
 bispi pradesh adhyaksh rajbhar kehete hai, ‘‘sapa sarkaar ke paas agle loksabhaa chunaav main janata ke saamne bataane ke liye kuch he hi nahin
 That is why the BSP is lying behind the former ministers and is getting its own action from the investigating agencies under the government
 ’’bhrashtachar ke virodh main pradesh sarkaar kii karrwai bispi ke purv mantriyon tak hi simatakar rah gai he
 Political analyst Abhay Kumar adds another aspect here
 unke shabdon main, ‘‘isaki bhi jaanch honi chahie ki purv bispi mantriyon ke bhrashtachar main kin adhikariyon ne unka sahyog kiya? mantriyon ko avaidh rup se karodon ru
 Which officials played a role in getting illegal assets of The government is only taking action on the corruption of ministers and has left the officials associated with it
 aise main is baat kii puri sambhaavna he ki aane vaale dinon main lachar jaanch ke chalate zyaadaatar mantriyon par court main dosha sabit hi nahin ho paaegaa
 "state Congress president Nirmal Khatri is seeing a different kind of politics in this matter
 ve maanate hai ki sapa or bispi main ek-duusare par karrwai na karne ko lekar sahmati he
 In his words, "before the 2007 assembly elections, Mayawati used to say in every speech to send Mulayam Singh and Shivpal Singh Yadav to jail
" sarkaar banane ke baad unhone tamaam tarah se jaanch karwaain, lekin ant main kuch bhi nateeja nahin niklaa
 The SP government is doing exactly that

 *** buudhvaar ko piem modi jab gujarat ke somnath mandir main vishesh puja ke liye pahunche to amit shah ke saath keshubhai patel kii maujuudagi ne siyaasi atakalon ko phir janm de diya
 Speculation began to rise as to whether the BJP was preparing to pursue Keshubhai Patel again to cut the Hardik Patel factor
 lekin kya ye itnaa aasaan he
 Know what are the difficulties of the Patidar movement and why the path is not easy for BJP-1
 team modi ke kitna kareeb aa paaenge keshubhai?keshubhai patel kabhi gujarat kii raajnneeti main modi se kaaphi upar the or unki gaddi par hi baad main modi asin hue
 Since then, the relationship between Modi and Keshubhai Patel has not been hidden from anyone
 lekin achaanakkeshubhai patelmodi ke saath dikhe to kaha jane laga ki hardik patel se mil rahi chunauti se nipatane ke liye phir bijepi duusare patidaar netaa keshubhai patel ko saath laane main juty he

 patelon main hardik kii kitni paith?kabhikeshubhai patel jis patidaar samudaayake netaa maane jate the or unke liye aarakshan kii maang ke saath hardik patel andolankaaree kii bhoomika main hai or unki sidhi takkar team modi se he
 Hardik Patel has done many big rallies in the state and till now it has not been easy for the BJP government to face it
 3
 What will be the impact of Hardik's association with Shiv Sena? Hardik Patel is now the face of Shiv Sena in Gujarat and in such a situation BJP is seeing possibilities for himself again
 keshubhai patel ko saath laana bijepi kii sambhaavnaaen phir se jagaati he
 However, BJP may have to bear the loss of Hardik and Shiv Sena being one
 shivasena kattar hinduvaadi maani jaati he or hardik patel ko agar thodaa bhi isse phayda hua to isaki sidhaa nuksaan bijepi ko hoga
 4
 rupani factor se kaise ubregi bijepi?anandi ben patel ko hataakar gaiyr patel netaa vijay rupani ko siem banane ke baad bijepi ke liye jaruri he ki koi patel netaa aage rakhaa jaae taaki hardik patel ko patidaar samudaay main paith banane kaa mauka na mil sake
 In such a situation, it will be easy for Keshubhai Patel to make a place in BJP again
 haalanki, loksabhaa chunaav main jeet ke baad modi keshubhai patel se milane pahunche the or ab somnath mandir main donon netaa saath dikhe
 Its political meanings are being discovered
 kya he gujarat main patel andolan kii prishthbhumi?bakshi ayog ne gujarat main saamaajik or shaikshanik rup se pichde samudaayon kii pahchaan kar 1970 ke dashak main anya pichhadaa varg ke liye aarakshan kaa praavdhaan kiya
 It did not include the Patidars, who had and still have social influence
 kshatriya samudaay ko aarakshan kii suchi main shaamil karne ke baad patelon ne aarakshan andolan shuru kiya
 At that time, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Gujarat was originally considered a party of Patels
 voton kii hissedari (uttar main 30 fisadi) ke lihaaj se congress kaa bhi rajya main acha hissaa he or yah rajya main multah kshatriyon kii party maani jaati he patidaaron kaa gussa is baat ko lekar zyaada tha ki unki jagah nichali jatiyon ko de di gai he
 Hardik Patel has emerged as the leader of the Patidars for the last two years and he has the support of regional leaders of many states against Modi
 ye bijepi ke liye musiibat ban sakati he isi kii kaat ke liye bijepi ko ek prabhaavshaalee patidaar netaa kii jarurat he

 Within a month, 17 people of four families in Delhi, Gurugram and Ghaziabad were killed by their loved ones
 gajiabad main ek shaks ne bivi bacchon kaa katl kar diya iske baad khudakushi kar lee
 a few days ago in Gurugram, a chemical engineer committed suicide after killing his wife and children
 vahiin mahrauli main sarkari skool ke ek teacher ne apni bivi or bacchon kaa berahami se katl kar diya
 Just think that one thing is common in all these incidents that the head of the family has carried out these incidents and killed innocent children
 kisi ne bivi bacchon par khanjar chalaa diya to kisi ne galaa ghont daalaa
 And someone tied his innocent daughters to the crematorium by tying tape on the mouth and nose of their innocent daughters
 kya mali tangi
 Is this the only way left to overcome depression and estrangement? Pradeep used to live with his family in Mussoorie, Ghaziabad
 lekin 3 din pehle uske kamare main bed par chaar laashen padi thim
 Apart from Pradeep, the dead bodies of his three, five and eight year old daughters
 teenon bacchiyon ke haath-pair khule the
 Just four inches of black tape was affixed from eye to mouth
 tepe is tarah lapeti gai thi ki wo naak yaa munh se saans hi naa le saken
 Pradeep himself also wrapped his mouth and nose with the same black tape
 par sawaal ye he ki kya koi shaks jiske donon haath khule hon sirf munh or naak par tepe lapet kar khudakushi kar saktaa he?ek aisi hi dil dahala dene vaali vaardaat gurugram main hui
 a good family
 behad padhaa-likhaa
 a high wage worker in good company
 magar ek rose naukari par aanch aa jaati he
 On a low salary, he does another job
 or phir ek rose apane hi haathon apni bivi or bacchon ko khanjar se maar daalata he
 Then he also commits suicide
 darasal, puri jindagi ek jaisi nahin hoti
 Good and bad days come with everyone
 mali haalat uski bhi bigadi
 But the financial crisis affected not only his pocket but also his mind
 bas phir kya tha
 He stabbed his wife and three children with a single knife
 ye sari ghatnaayen insaan ke khatm hote sabar or bekaabu hote gusse kaa nateeja hai

 Asaram is finding it difficult to stay in jail, so even Asaram's loved ones are not able to digest this thing at all
 shaayad isiilie asaram ke sevak or samarthak peedit ladki ke parivaar ko jaan se maarane kii dhamkee de rahe hai
 If the victim's family lawyer is believed, the family members are being pressured to change the statement
 peedit parivaar ke vakil manish vyas ke mutabik asaram ke samarthak or sevak peedit ladki ke pita or parivaar ko jaan se maarane kii dhamkee de rahe hai
 In this regard, he also released a tape to the media, in this tape, a man is asking the friend of the victim's father's father to convince them that they both change their statements and this trend has been going on for the past several days
 peedit ke vakil kaa kahana he ki agar unke muvakkil ne apana bayaan nahin badla to unhen or unke parivaar ko iske gambhir parinaam bhugatne padenge
 The victim girl's lawyer says that the entire family has been very nervous since these threats
 peedit ke vakil ke mutabik ye aawaaj asaram ke puraane sevadaar shyaam kii he or usne peedit ke pita ko phone par ye dhamkee bhi di he ki centre sarkaar kuch maheenon kii he
 It will change after 6 months
 apane parivaar kaa soch lo or maamle ko waapas le lo
 According to the victim's lawyer, the minor girl's father will soon file a complaint with the police
 is audio recording main kitni sachai he ye to police tafteesh ke baad hi pataa chalegaa, lekin ye bhi sach he ki isse pehle is maamle kii jaanch kar rahe jodhpur ke disipi ko bhi jaan se maarane kii dhamkee mil chuki he
 During satsang, there was a choice of girls
 a saint would keep an eye on the girls in his satsang and then get a chance to sit and sit in his harem, it is strange to hear this, but his old Vaidya and Rajdar talked about Asaram
 The new disclosure is something like this
 is shaks kii maane to asaram apane saadhakon kii madad se satsang ke dauraan ladakiyon ko chunata tha or wo bhi bilkul anokhe tareeke se
 If he believed that Asaram's old serviceman and Vaidya Amrit Prajapati by profession, he himself saw the truth of Asaram with his own eyes, which after seeing it was difficult for him to believe his own eyes for the first time
 kyonki sant kaa chola odh kar asaram koi chand dinon se nahin, balki saalon se apane satsang main aanevaali ladakiyon or mahilaon kaa yon shoshan kar rahaa tha or ye sabakuch itane shaatiranaa tareeke se hota tha ki khud asaram uske aas-paas rahanevaale sadhak rupi gurgon ke alaava or kisi ko bhi is khel kii kaanon-kaan koi khabar nahin hoti
 Asaram does with laser light, according to Ishaprajapati, Asaram used to tell only his girls in satsang in gestures about the girls who liked him
 or iske liye apni kutiyaa se nikal satsang kii mandap tak jane ke dauraan asaram kai baar apane haath main rakhe ek chote lager lite se raushnee chamkaaya karata tha
 If Asaram liked one of the girls standing in his reception, he would light up the girl three times with a laser light one by one on the pretext of conversation and just then, as Asaram proceeded, his vicious seeker They would start chanting to take that girl to Asaram's harem
 ladki ko ab samarpan or guru ke liye tyaag karne jaisi baton ke jariye brinwash karne kii koshish kii jaati or jaise hi ladki jaraa bhi kamjor padati, use sidhaa guru kii dhyaan kii kutiyaa yani asaram ke haram tak pahunchaa diya jaataa
 Assuming Asaram to be one of the greatest philosophers on Shilpi, the police may be tightening their grip on Asaram as well as one of his disciple Shilpi, but as many as ten slaves have already been with Asaram like 25, More seekers or say that there used to be henchmen, who used to arrange girls for Asaram
 lekin tab bhi shilpi apane tamaam gurgon ke mukaable kahin zyada shaatir or asaram kii sabase zyada bharosemand thi
 Because often Shilpi does not even need a laser light to understand Asaram's liking, but only by his gesture and demeanor could she sense which girl Asaram wants to grow close with

 (is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he
 This is published directly from Syndicate Feed) (NDTV team has not edited this news
 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he) Three mps are to be elected in the Rajya Sabha from Delhi for the Rajya Sabha
 isko lekar aam aadmi party main ghamaasan jari he
 Party leaders and supporters of poet Kumar Vishwas are constantly demanding to send him to the Rajya Sabha, while there is no official statement from the party on this
 vishwaas ne bhi twitor ke jariye apane samarthakon ko kaha he ki unke liye rajyasabha seat myne nahin rakhti he, pehle desh phir party
 a source of Aam Aadmi Party said that it is certain that Kumar Vishwas will not go to Rajya Sabha on behalf of Aam Aadmi Party
 sutron kii maane to vishwaas ne pichley kuch samay main party ke stand se hatakar baaten kahi hai, jinase party khush nahin he
 It is clear that till January 5, the last date for nomination for Rajya Sabha is
 kejariwal kii ore se abhi tak kai anya logon ko bhi rajyasabha seat kaa ofer diya tha
 The party wants to send a strong face to the Rajya Sabha, but so far, whatever has been approached by the party, it has refused

 However, so far no major reason has been revealed from all of them, due to which they have turned down the offer
 lekin kaha ja saktaa he ki aam aadmi party kii nitiyon se ye khush nahin hai
 Through the tweet of Vishwas, supporters of Tanjkumar Vishwas created a ruckus at the Delhi party office, demanding that he be sent to the Rajya Sabha
 haalanki, kumaar ne twit kiya jiske bhi kai matlab nikal sakate hai
 He wrote that "I have always told you, first the country, then the party, then the person
 party mukhyalay par jamaa kaaryakartaaon se nivedan he ki swaraj, back2basic, paardarshita ke muddon ke liye sangharsh karen, mere hit-ahit ke liye nahin

 They have already chosen their three names

 How to move on after a serious heartbreak ? ( one of the top three questions by my clients
 ) i took many years to move on after my 1st broken relationship
 After many wrong decisions, much hatred and ill health later , i finally allowed Mindfulness into my life
 It took me 7 years for closure and 15 years to finally love a man truly
 ( you don't have to have a snail speed like i did !) So how did i attract the perfect man i envisioned ? How did i move on after heartbreak ? 1
 i stopped talking about my ex partner completely
 2
 i allowed a complete cleansing process
 No casual or serious dating
 3
 i finally started to ‘bless my ex partner'
