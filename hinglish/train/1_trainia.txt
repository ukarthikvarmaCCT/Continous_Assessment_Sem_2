 bihar main hone vaale upachunaav main mahagathbandhan kii partiyon ke bich khinchataan jari he
 Especially the RJD and the Congress are face to face regarding the by-elections in Bhabua
 argedy pehle hi elaan kar chuki he ki vah bihar main teen siton par hone vaale upachunaav par apane ummidavaar utaaregi
 The Congress has no problem with Araria Lok Sabha and Jehanabad Assembly, but does not want to leave the Bhabhua seat at any cost
 saal 2015 ke vidhansabha chunaav main yah seat janata dal you ke khate main thi, lekin jeet bijepi kii hui thi
 The Janata Dal is no longer a part of the u Mahagathbandhan
 lihaaja is seat par congress apana daawa kar rahi he
 Senior Congress leader Sadanand Singh says that neither the RJD nor the Congress stood in Bhabhua seat in the last election
 aise main vahaan kii raajnneetik paristhiti ko dekhte hue yah seat congress ke khate main janaa chahie, kyonki congress yahaan se pehle saat baar vijayi hui he, jabaki argedy do hi baar is seat ko jeet pai hai
 According to the social equation, this seat shoots to Congress, in such a situation, Congress should get this seat
 haalanki argedy teenon siton ke liye ummidavaaron ko bhi tay kar chuki he
 RJD National Vice President Rabri Devi said in a meeting of the party's parliamentary board that we have decided to contest all three seats
 congress kii taraf se koi baatcheet karne nahin aayaa he
 They should come to talk
 par sawaal uthta he ki jab mahagathbandhan kii partiyon ke bich koi baatcheet hi nahin hui, to aakhirkaar argedy ne teenon siton par ummidavaar utarane kaa elaan kaise kar diya?congress yah bhaleebhanti jaanati he ki agar is baar wo bhabhua seat ke liye nahin ladati he, to use iskaa khamiyanja aane vaale chunaav main bhugatna pad saktaa he
 Therefore, she has taken a stand in her stand and said that if she does not get Bhabhua seat, then she can field candidates in all three seats
 duusari tarfargediuh chaahati he ki congress sirf bhabhua seat lade, kyonki usase use phayda hoga
 Bhabhua seat is Brahmin Bahul region
 aise main agar congress yahaan se apana ummidavaar khadaa karti he, to bijepi kaa vot kaatega or argedy ko isse phayda hoga, lekin agar congress arriya loksabhaa ke upachunaav main maidan main utarati he, to nuksaan argedy kaa hona tay hai

 halke purple color kii sari main ausat kad kii ek bahut dubli-patali si ladki upiessi kii building main intervyuu ke liye pahunchi
 Initially there was a little fear, but then in the interview that lasted for half an hour, he faced every question with confidence and courage
 baahar nikalate hue vandana khush thi
 But even that day, he did not rest after returning home
 kitaaben uthaain or agali iees pariksha kii taiyaari main jute gayi
 This result was a surprise for Vandana

 No coaching, no guidance

 No friends preparing for IAS
 yahaan tak ki vandana kabhi ek kitaab kharidne bhi apane ghar se baahar nahin gayi

 Vandana also got her early education in a government school in the village
 vandana ke pita mahipal singh chouhan kehete hai, ‘‘gaanv main skool acha nahin tha
 So i sent my elder boy out to study

 When will you send me read it

 But the merit daughter's passion and passion for studies forced her
 vandana ne ek din apane pita se gusse main kaha, ‘‘main ladki hum, isiilie mujhe padhgaye nahin bhej rahe

 For a year, even the people of the house had no idea of his existence

 No one was allowed to disturb him

 Along with Vandana, all the people of the house were preparing for the Civil Services Examination
 unki vahi duniya thi
 What if not IAS? ''nothing

 Vandana was the same world

 Never seen a movie in a cinema hall

 Today, the same people of the village, who once used to get mad at the girl's reading, are proud of Vandana's success
 kah rahe hai, ‘‘ladakiyon ko jarur padhaanaa chahie

 The story of Abdul Jabbar, who was engaged in fighting for the rights of the 20 thousand Saathibhopal's gas victims who were separated in the battle of Haq, is self-supporting
 ek sanghathan banaakar beete 30 varsh ke sangharsh main jabbaar peediton ko haq kaa kuch hissaa dilaane main to safal rahe hai, magar ab bhi bahut kuch milanaa baaki he
 He feels sorry that more than 20 thousand companions have been separated from him during his struggle

 At the same time, thousands of people have been killed due to diseases caused by poisonous gas in the last 31 years and still thousands are standing on the threshold of death waiting for their turn
 haadase kii raat se hi abdul jabbaar ne peediton ke bich jaakar kaam shuru kar diya tha
 He was 28 at the time, now 58 years old
 haadase ke ek varsh baad unhone bhopal gas peedit mahila udyog sanghathan banaaya or sangharsh kaa silsilaa aage badhaayaa
 Giving details of the story of his struggle, Abdul Jabbar said that the first success in the fight for the rights of the victims came in 1988 when the Supreme Court ruled to give alimony
 uske baad farvari 1989 main bharat sarkaar or union carbide ke bich bhopal samjhauta hua
 According to this, the injured received 25-25 thousand and the dead got one lakh each
 iske baad proreta par ghayalon ko 25-25 hajaar or mritkon ke parijanon ko ek-ek lakh atirikt mila
 Abdul Jabbar, the victim of more than five lakh people, says that there has been controversy since the beginning of the number of dead, but in 2001 a shocking figure came out which showed that 15 thousand 276 people have died and from five lakh 76 thousand
 More people are prone to the ill effects of gas
 duusari ore unke sanghathan kii ladaai ke chalate hi varsh 2010 main bhopal ke mukhya nyaayik dandadhikari kii adaalat ne union carbide ke afasaron ko do-do varsh kii sajaa sunai, magar afsos he ki is par ab tak amal nahin hua he
 He further said that his organization filed a petition in the Supreme Court for compensation of five times more than Union Carbide based on the figures of death and victims in 2001, in the meanwhile the then government filed a cooperative petition to improve the number
 She did it
 donon yachikaayen lambit hai
 Jabbar says that on the one hand his court battle is going on, on the other hand his organization keeps going down the road
 shahjahanni park is baat kaa gavaah he jahaan 1986 se har mangalvaar or shanivaar ko gas peedit ikattha hekar apni aawaaj buland karte rahe hai, ab sirf shanivaar ko log ikattha hote hai, kyonki saptaah main do baar aane par kiraye main zyada dhanrashi kharch ho jaati he
 Whereas the organization was formed for the fight of the victims of the tragedy, the Swabhimaan Center is being run to make the affected financially competent
 is centre main silaai, kadhai, jari kaa kaam or computer kaa prashikshan diya jaataa he
 This center is an example of communal harmony, where hindu-muslim women not only train together, but also do not refrain from eating together
 is centre se ab tak aath hajaar se zyada mahilaayein prashikshan paa chuki he
 Jabbar says that during this struggle of the past 30 years, he has seen more than 20 thousand people who had supported him
 ye ve log he jo unke sangharsh ke na keval saathi the balki unase paariwarik rishte bhi the
 Many times, when he got the news of someone's death, he felt that if he had got better treatment, he would have survived, but this could not happen

 However, this incident is completely denied by the police
 police kaa maananaa he ki donon pakshon main marpet jarur hui he, lekin gobar khilaane kii baat galat he
 Interestingly, the police have confessed to throwing cow dung at the woman
 shivpuri ke esai rajendra sharma ne kaha ki jaanch ke baad police ne donon pakshon par balve kaa mukadmaa darj kar giraftaar kii he
 Many people may be shocked by their impunity
 unhone saaf kaha tha ki ratan tata ne naino laakar galati kii
 He indiscriminately presented a list of many 'silly and pointless' ideas that management consultants try to sell
 unhone 'da harvard bijness schools of da world’ par aarope lagaaya ki ''vah aisi bakawaas cheez padhaa rahaa he jise emb kehete hai
 "there cannot be many friends of such a man with such a clear choice
 ''kya industry main ab aapkaa koi dost bachaa he?”rajeev bajaj kuch der chup rahete hai or phir hans padate hai
 The purpose of this question was to get some interesting statements
 bajaj aise sawaalon ke prati udaar rahe hai
 His great-grandfather Jamnalal Bajaj founded Bajaj Auto in 1926
 bajaj apane priy bajaj auto ke raste ko jo bhi kaatane kii koshish karata he, ve us par tatkaal hamalaa bolte hai
 If someone has not found a flaw in their new product RE 60, then it is not good
 aarai60 bharat kii pehali quadricycle he
 This is quite different from the quadricycles of Europe, which are expensive, low-selling, special types of cars made of extraordinary things
 aarai-60 ek choti-si gaadi he jo acchhee tarah se taiyaar kiye gaye autoricshaw kaa ehsaas detii he
 Manufacturers of small cars driving as taxis are scared of the RE60, as it will cost significantly less, a three-wheeler
 25 lakh ru
 And Maruti Suzuki's Alto Key 2
 5 lakh ru
 Somewhere in between
 yah eendhan ke lihaaj se bhi zyada kifayati hogi, ek litre main 35 kimi kii milage ke saath
 Manufacturers of three-wheeler autos are also scared because the RE60 looks better than a three-wheeler with doors, roof, better technology (water cooled, twin spark plugs, five gears) and more stability because of the four wheels
 yah prati kimi sirf 60 gram carbon dioxide chhodti he, jo kisi choti car ke mukaable aadha he
 Every year around 4,50,000 three-wheelers are sold in the domestic market
 akele dilli kii sadakon par hi 70,000 tipahiyaa chalate hai
 Bajaj says that Chief Minister Sheila Dixit often used to complain to him that what a large number of foreign tourists coming to the capital would be carrying the image about these autos
 ve thodaa zyada sammanit gaadi chaahati thim
 If other states like him also preferred it, then the assembly line of the Aurangabad factory of Bajaj will become very busy
 auto main chauthaa pahiatata motors ke managing diarector karl slim ne quadricycle laane ke auchity par is saal twitor par sawaal khadaa kiya: ''aakhir kyon? sarkaar or industry yatayaat suraksha or paryaavaran ko bachaane ke prayaason ko aage badha rahi he, ab ham quadricycle par vichaar kar rahe hai!ham peeche kyon bad rahe hai?” is par bajaj ne ek bijness akhbaar se kaha ki aarai-60 laane kaa matlab he, tipahiyaa vaahan istemaal karne waalon ko chaarpaiye kii suraksha dena
 "the argument that all three-wheeler owners should buy a car in its place is exactly the same as telling people that those who cannot buy bread should eat cakes and fill their stomachs
" is tarah ke ravaie ke pehle bhi ham durbhagyapurna nattejey dekh chuke hai
 Karl Slim was in fact replicating the spirit of Venu Srinivasan, head of Bajaj's competitor TVS Motor Company in two-wheeler and three-wheelers
 venu vaise rajeev ke pita rahul bajaj ke dost bhi hai
 Srinivasan had expressed concern that the quadricycle would lead to deterioration in safety and pollution standards
 is par bajaj kaa javaabi prahaar tha ki jab badi kaaron ko hi sabase surakshit mana ja rahaa he to duusare sabhi vaahanon—cycle, motorcycle, scooter, moped, tipahiyaa, choti car, medium sies car—par pratibandh laga dena chahie
 It is a little harsh reaction, but there is no middle ground for Rajiv Bajaj
 maaruti ke 79 varshiya sammanneey chairman or rajeev ke pita ke ek or dost aar
 C
 bhargav ko iskaa andaja ho gaya, jab unhone yah kaha tha ki yadi quadricycle ko ek hi road par kisi car ke saath chalaakar test kiya jaae to yah chaar guna zyada carbon dioxide chhodgai
 Bajaj said on this, "if i take Mr
 Bhargava's Maruti car and drive it on a car track in Europe, where the roads are big and the speed is high, then let's see how much pollution it has
 ”is saal auto industry ke sanghathan socity of indian automobile menuphacturers (siam) dwaara yojit ek conference kol main yah vivaad or bhi spasht ho gaya
 Some companies have loudly demanded that Bajaj be stopped from launching the RE60 for now
 tipahiyaa banane vaali company piyajio ke ravi chopra chaahate the ki bajaj ko teen saal baad hi ise launch karne kii ijaajat di jaae taaki sabko barabari kaa mauka mili
 a criterion in the definition of quadricycle is that it should not weigh more than 500 kg
 slim chaahate hai ki yah dayera badhaakar 700 kilogram tak kiya jaae
 For reference, let us tell you that RE60 weighs 397 kg and Tata Nano weighs 650 kg
 lekin bajaj kii quadricycle niyam or kanoon sambandhi adngon ko paar kar rahi he
 On May 22, the government allowed quadricycles to be used as public transport within the city limits
 iske baad 8 agast ko sadak parivahan evam rajmarg mantralay ne quadricycle ko vaahan kii shrenee main shaamil karne ke lihaaj se kendriya motor vaahan adhinium main sanshodhan karne ke liye ek draft notification jari kiya
 Accordingly, the quadricycle will need special license and registration and will have to prominently write 'Q' on its body
 bajaj auto ke bijness deveopment pramukh es
 Sivakumar says, "we are waiting for approval and can start (RE60 sales) immediately or later, depending on what kind of details are finally approved
" ” yadi sab thik rahaa to bajaj kii nai gaadi agle saal sadakon par daudti dikh sakati he
 However the issue divided the auto makers
 kaaphi lambey vichaar-vimarsh ke baad siam ke tatkaaleen mahanideshak or philhal neshnal skill deveopment council ke pramukh dilip chinoy ne parivahan mantralay ko do alag-alag prastaav bheje
 The first was in favor of the quadricycle and the second against it
 mantralay in donon prastaavon par chuppi markar baith gaya
 Years later, when Rajiv Bajaj developed the RE60 and was looking for a way to market it, Siam's open attitude helped him
 tathy yah bhi he ki unki quadricycle tipahiyaa auto main sudhaar ke liye he na ki car jaisaa kuch laane ke liye
 The second person to study and experience Rajiv Bajaj, the critic John F
 wales par aarope laga sakate hai, ve 1980 ke dashak main rahul bajaj ke kansaltent the
 Wallace, an old British auto industry expert, quickly became a confidant of Bajaj
 yah vah samay tha jab rajeev ne pune se mechanical ejineering kii padhai puri kii thi or training ke liye apane pita kii company jwine kii thi
 He was the first engineer in his family
 unke pita, ankal or bhai, sabhi commers ke chaatr rahe or emb kiya tha
 After completing his training at Bajaj Auto, Rajiv moved to Warwick University, UK to pursue a master's degree in manufacturing systems engineering
 wales uske paas main hi rahete the
 Rajiv returned to Bajaj Auto in December 1990
 lekin aisa lagata tha ki vah lambey samay tak nahin rah paaenge
 Rahul Bajaj wanted him to go to Harvard to pursue his MBA as per family tradition
 is baar phir wales ne hastkshep kiya or sakht lahaze main kiya
 He showed a finger in front of Rajiv's father's face and said, "if you sent this boy to do MBA, then by the time it comes back, the company will not survive
" ”wales ne shaayad thodi naatakeeyata dikhaai thi, lekin thodi hi
 In the mid-1980s, autocratic competition in the two-wheeler industry began to take root
 honda, yamaha, sujuki sab maujuud thim
 Even now there was a waiting period of 18 months for his scooters, but everyone in the company was restless
 kyonki is tarah kii vatting 10 saal pehle kaa chalan thi, jab bazaar main 100 sisi kii japani motorcycilen nahin ai thim
 Supply chain was the initial term
 research evam deveopment, technology, quality or productivity jaisi chizon par koi jor nahin tha
 But Warwick's era was eye-opening for Rajiv
 unhone maisi farguson ke tractor plant or honda ke car kaarkaane main kuch samay guzaara
 He noted that equipment and components have been placed in a certain way
 log multi skild hai
 Quality is not compromised
 bajaj auto ne 1984 main kavasaki ke saath technology ke liye ek gathjod kiya jiske tahat rajeev japan ke daure par gaye, jahaan unhone or prabhavi menuphaccharing dekhi
 (bajaj's top team- Kevin d'souza, Abraham Joseph, Pradeep Srivastava, S
 ravikumar, ke
 Srinivas and Rakesh Sharma) The selection of colleagues is natural that the first thing that got their attention in Bajaj Auto was its manufacturing process
 is tarah 23 saal kii umr main unhone sikhaanaa shuru kar diya
 He started running classes of engineers and supervisors in batches of 20 to 30
 unhone varavik main apane project ke tahat customer oriented menuphaccharing par 150 pej kaa ek sinopsis banaaya tha or unhone nae chaatro ke bich isaki pratiyaan vitarit kin
 Such classes were conducted in the evening
 isamen homework bhi diya jaataa tha
 In one such class, when Rajiv asked a question on manufacturing, Abraham Joseph, 22 years old, stood up to answer it
 iske aadhe ghante baad tak joseph unase baat karte rahe
 Joseph, a mechanical engineering graduate from the Regional Engineering College, Bhopal, knew everything Rajiv knew, without studying at Warwick, earning a master's degree or leaving India
 rajeev ne kaha, ''main tatkaal samaj gaya ki is bande main kudarti pratibha he
 Popularly known as Joey, Joseph became part of the top team that Rajiv had set up to excel in manufacturing
 kai saal tak joy ne bajaj auto ke aranddy kaa kaam sambhala or unhone ''sab kuch dizin kiya
 "the next person to join this nascent core team was Pradeep Srivastava who is now the company's Chief Operating Officer
 iity-dilli or iiem-bangaloru se padhai karne vaale pradeep chaahate to kahin bhi ja sakate the, lekin unhone bajaj main kaam karne kaa nirnay liya kyonki menuphaccharing ko lekar unamem ek junun tha
 Soon many more people joined him like D
D
 ve
 Raghunath who is now the head of Materials, Sanjay Saraswat who is now the Vice President of Marketing and Madhav Kinney who specializes in Intellectual Property and is handling business development
 scooter kaa nirmaan bandarajeev ne apni company ko aage badhaane ke liye dusron kii nakal karne kaa iraadaa bilkul chhod diya or marketing par jor diya
 If he benefited from this, he also had to make some sacrifices
 bajaj ne scoteret, moped or halke commercial vaahanon se duuri banaae rakhi he
 The biggest sacrifice was the scooter, which the company has stopped making since the beginning of 2010
 isse bahut log stabdh rah gaye the
 Bajaj's grandfather Kamal Nayan brought a scooter to India and his father Rahul brought it up for decades
 unke pita ab bhi is nirnay se khush nahin hai or iske liye vah rajeev ko nalayak kehete hai
 "our start was a new beginning for the company as well," says Rajiv
 bajaj auto kaa astitv to pehle bhi tha
 But with our arrival, scooters came to an end and a new round of motorcycles began
 ”or ab tipahie main chauthaa pahiyaa jodakar rajeev aam logon ko dhoop-dhul or barish main bhi kam keemat main safar kaa mauka dene vaale hai
 This will also give his company an edge

 This disputed statement of comment trump during the soap opera has come out from an old video

 Trump, a famous businessman, said, "when you are a star, they (women) let you do everything
" trump ne yah baat ek televijan sho 'acces hollywood' ke host billy bash se nijee baatcheet main kahi thi
 However, this statement was captured in a live microphone

 He said, 'not only do we celebrate the black day to criticize the Congress party and the government of that time, we want to make the present and future generations aware of the country, we can keep ourselves aware of the Constitution
 Let's remember 'apatkaal ko yaad karte hue piem modi ne ek kahani sunai, unhone kaha, 'jab apatkaal tha, tab main sakriya tha
 During that time i was going by bus, a lady in the bus was quarreling with the conductor
 wo vruddh maa conductor ko kah rahi thi ki unhen acha kadak note do

 Puttaparthi's economy and activities have been centered around the Sathya Sai Baba Ashram
 puttaparthi main ashram ke andar aane-jane vaale logon ko chhodkar vahaan kii aabaadi 7,000 se bhi kam he
 The Sathya Sai Foundation has built all the major places and institutions that distinguish Puttaparthi from any other small town in India

 Puttaparthi was an ideal Indian town due to the school, excellent water connections, electricity and internet facilities

 Even when Baba was alive and he used to go to Whitefield or Kodaikanal Ashram in Bangalore, Puttaparthi became a haunted town

 In 2010 he spent Rs 52–52 lakh
 main kareeb 30 vila beche
 Today he gets Rs 30 lakh for the small villa behind the ashram

 Partho, who runs Earth Song's head office, says, "we are giving a great discount, but we have bought land at high prices and now have to sell it at a lower price
" haalanki puttaparthi main or uske aasapaas jameen kii keemat ek saint ke liye ek lakh ru

 Many people made huge profits
 unhone nunatam keemton par jameen kharidi or use developers ko bech diya, jinhone us par apartment banaakar shraddhaluon ko bech die
 "around 70 per cent of the apartments on the three major routes of Puttaparthi are lying vacant and now, after Baba's death, there are fears that they may not remain empty at all
" hastshilp kii vasteen bechney vaale vyavsaayee bhi buree tarah prabhavit hue hai
 "it has been more than 35 years since my parents came to Puttaparthi from Gujarat," says Vinod Kumar, a handicraft businessman
 unhone bahut chota dhandha shuru kiya or baba ke aashirwad se fale-foole
 Vinod's father started a handicrafts business which he is handling today

 One such transformative phase was the arrival of Quartz watches in the 1970s
 usase masini ghadi udyog kaa bhattha hi baithta laga
 But the market of watch-live watches continued and it continues in the era of smart watches and smart phones
 smart ghadibhan or paaramparik ghadibhan, donon hi ek hi tarah kii utpaada kii shrenee main, ek jaisi dizin or kalai par bhale sajati hon, lekin unke graahak ekadam pital or sone kii tarah alag hai
 Many big milestones can be remembered in the journey of change in watches
 ghadisaj yaa ghadi banane kii sabase puraani parampara chaabi bhar ke ghadi chalaane se shuru hoti he
 Pocket watches, table watches, hand-held or hanging watches, and decorated wrist watches, all used to move through the keys
 haalanki vah pechidi prakriya thi jisase ghadibhan ekadam thik-thik chakra puraa karen
 In the process of thinking and the machine made more agile due to this, man has become capable of making even atomic elements like atoms
 behad chote aakaar kii kalai ghadibhan bananaa chunauteepurn tha, phir bhi use bana liya gaya
 The invention of quartz and automatic watches then pushed back the time measurement machine
 kwatarj betry se chalata isliye ghadibhan sasti ho gayi or sabhi ko uplabdh hone lageen jabaki automatic ghadibhan haath hilne-dulne se milane vaali kynetic urja par nirbhar thim
 In the current era, the digital revolution is at its peak, the wristwatch is now starting to tell a lot, know how many calories you have spent, or it can also be used to answer phone calls
 yani kalai par saji bahuupayogi cheez ho sakati he
 In spite of everything, if you ask the watch collectors and experts, then you will tell that the most preferred wrist watch is the key
 kai adhyayanon ke baad hi ashtaguru ne 2008 main sabase alag 'exceptional timepisej' nilaamee shuru kii
 Statistics show that the most expensive selling wristwatch at the auction was the key-powered Rolex Daytona, previously owned by Hollywood star Paul Newman
 1968 kii bani vah kalai ghadi hollywood abhinayta ko apni patni joan woodward se uphaar main mili thi
 It was put up for auction in New York in 2017 and it 1
 78 karod dollar main biki (jisamen nilaamee ghar kaa hissaa / kharidaar kaa premium vagairah shaamil tha)
 Personally, i agree with the prevailing belief that hand-operated things have more importance than automatic activities because it tests man's skills
 chaabi se chalane vaali ghadi ke kai kaam romaanch paidaa kar sakate hai or vichaaron ko ekagra bhi kar sakate hemphir, aaj ke bhaagambhag vaale jivan main to ghadi main chaabi bharna dhyaan lagane jaisaa bhi ho saktaa he
 Another important aspect is that they are not produced at wholesale prices, so they are difficult to meet and the demand is also special
 dekhne main bhi chaabi bharne vaali kalai ghadibhan zyada aakarshak lagati hai kyonki ye patali or choti hoti hai jabaki automatic ghadibhan kalai par baari hoti hai
 In addition to its special aspects, the man-labor employed in key-clocks makes it more human than the rest
 ant main, haath se bani ghadibhan is maamle main bhi automatic ghadiiyon se mahatv kii hai ki ye maanav sabhyataa main us chalaang kaa pratik hai jab ham dikkaal main ek ho paae or aage kaa rasta tay karne lage
 The aspect of time or time is most relevant, it also proves that Jeff Bezos of Amazon has started the '10,000 Sala Watch' process
 yah ghadi das sahasrabdiyon tak kaam karegi or makasad yah bataanaa he ki hamaari prajati kii viraasat kitni lambii he
 Overall, the real thing is that our reality will be explained by time
 is myne main haath se sanchalit ghadi hamaare safar ko zyada vistaar se bataati he

 barahavin fail ipies! he na hairaan karne vaali baat
 But this is a reality and it has been demonstrated by a simple young man from Morena, whose name is Manoj Sharma
 manoj sharma aaj mumbai main atirikt police ayukta hai
 Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis on Wednesday released a book written on the same Manoj Sharma
 angreji main likhi kitaab kaa naam he "12th fail" yah pustak likhi he anuraag pathak ne
 Anurag Pathak has been Manoj Sharma's room partner for 15 years
 kitaab main sharma ke vyaktitv kii achchhai or kamajori donon kaa varnan he, khaskar padhai main phiseddi hone ke baavjood oonchi digriyon ko hasil karne or manzil tak pahunchane kii jid kaa
 Manoj Sharma struggled to overcome the failures and continued to pursue, who became an IPS even after his 12th failure
 lekhak anuraag pathak ke mutabik manoj sharma unki kitaab ke hero hai or un par kitaab likhane kaa makasad hi padhai or pariksha se darane vaale vidhyaarthiyon main himmat bharna he, nai ummid dikhaanaa he
 The special thing that how your failure can be turned into success, this learning comes from the life of Manoj Sharma
 12veen main fail hona hi manoj sharma ke liye vardaan ho gaya
 It happened that in that year there was such an SDM in Morena which had completely banned the copying, otherwise Manoj Sharma would have passed like other students
 aise halaat main amuman koi bhi vidhyaarthee us es dm ko kosta lekin manoj sharma ne uski tarah banane kaa thaan liya or phir jo sangharsh kaa rasta chunaa vah safalataa kii manzil kii taraf badhata gaya
 But it was not all that easy either
 raah main kaante hi kaante the
 Lack of money was the biggest obstacle
 aarthik sankat ko dur karne ke liye sharma ko iske liye bade logon ke kutton kii dekhbhaal kerani padi
 Had to work in the library
 lekin jid ko kabhi marane nahin diya
 Passed 12th, got a degree and then got a phd in Mass Communication
 civil sarvice kii pariksha main teen baar fail hue
 It is said that love makes a man weak, but Manoj Sharma's love, reverence became his strength and then he had to win before the stubbornness

 He also made a claim in the tweet, "he has a Canadian passport, but he has not been to Canada for the last seven years

 The 2014 party was also attended by Mica along with Raj Kundra, Shilpa Shetty Shetty Kundra and Akshay Kumar

 Hundreds of vehicles get stuck in the water up to the waist

 The monsoon has not received rains this year yet, but the history so far says that only one hour of rain causes the capital to get upset
 har saal kii tarah is baar bhi vaade kiye gaye the ki jalajmav kii sthiti nahin hone denge, lekin dekhnaa hoga ki barish is baar logon ko rulaati he yaa nahin

 upi bijepi ke adhyaksh dow
 Laxmikant Bajpai has currently ruled out any such possibility, terming Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi the possibility of contesting the Lok Sabha elections from a seat in Uttar Pradesh
 haalanki ve kehete hai ki modi ke upi se chunaav ladgaye par party yahaan kii 80 loksabhaa siton main se 40 se zyada jeet sakati he
 Dr
 in Chitrakoot bajpeyi ne pramukh samvaadadaata ashish mishra se apni yojana ke bare main baat kii
 Excerpts from the conversation
 pichley vidhansabha chunaav main haar ke baad pradesh kaarysmiti kii pehali baithak se bijepi ko kya hasil hua?kaarysmiti main aatmamanthan hua
 Flaws were discovered
 ab party kaa puraa jor booth str tak sanghathan khadaa karne par hoga
 The better performance of the worker and public at the booth will open the way for a good performance in the next election
 pradesh main bijepi har chunaav main apana janaadhar khoti ja rahi he
 What does the party believe to be the reason? There are two main areas where the party is very weak
 pehla, gramin ilaakon main party kii pakad dhili hui he or doosraa, duusari partiyon kii jativaadee raajnneeti ke kaaran pichhadaa varg kaa matadaata party se chhitak gaya he
 The strategy of joining them again with the party is being worked out
 mandir andolan ke baad sust hue kaaryakartaaon ke boote chunaav kaise jeetenge?kaaryakartaaon main utsaahaheenta ‘‘eks factor’’ ke kaaran he
 After the Ram temple movement, the party grew rapidly
 sanghathan main upar se lekar neeche tak nae padaadhikari bane
 Over time, these officers also withdrew and others took their place
 is vajah se purv (eks) padaadhikariyon kii kaaphi sankhya bijepi main he jo party main upekshit mahasoos kar rahe hai
 These will have to be reactivated
 musalamaanon ke bich party kaa aadhaar behad kamjor he
 Can the party do better in the next election without taking their votes? i do not say that the BJP does not want the votes of the Muslims
 lekin musalamaanon kaa vot paane ke liye aisa koi kaam nahin kiya jayega ki party kahin kii na rahe
 Why is it taking so long to elect a Lok Sabha candidate? Regional parties have fielded their candidates, but now they are being changed
 bijepi thok-bajaakar ek baar pratyaashee ghoshit karegi jise badalane kii gunjaaish na ke baraabar rahegi
 How many seats has the party set to win in Uttar Pradesh in the Lok Sabha elections? We will try to win as many seats as possible
 kaaryakartaaon se mili feedback ke aadhaar par pradesh kii 80 loksabhaa siton main se bijepi 32 par jeetne kii sthiti main he
 If the 'modi Fact' comes, the figure will cross 40
 kya gujarat ke mukhyamantri uttar pradesh kii loksabhaa seat se chunaav ladenge?narendra modi ko uttar pradesh se chunaav ladaane kaa party main kisi bhi str par philhal koi vichaar nahin ho rahaa
 Some activists are making such demands personally
 bijepi hindutv kii baat karti he, lekin ram mandir ke mudde par khamosh ho gai he
 Is this no longer an issue? It is not a Ram temple issue, it is a symbol of the bjp's faith
 loksabhaa chunaavon main ham janata se apil karenge ki ram mandir kaa nirmaan karaane ke liye bijepi ko centre main bahumat den
 The CBI court of Ghaziabad has pronounced its verdict on the famous murder mystery of Aarushi Talwar and Hemraj
 court ne is maamle ke mukhya aaropee or aarushi ke mata-pitanoopur talwaar or rajesh talwarko doshi tehraaya he
 Special Judge Shyam Lal, while delivering the verdict, has held Rajesh and Nupur Talwar guilty of killing Aarushi and Hemraj
 ab sajaa kaa elaan mangalvaar ko hoga
 The Talwar couple were present in the court at the time of the verdict
 padhein: is murder mistry main kab kya hua
 
 
 The court has convicted both of them under Section 302 (murder) of IPC
 iske alaava rajesh talwaar ko ipisi kii dhara 203 (galat exiaar darj karaane ke doshi), 201 (saboot mitaanaa)or 34 (kaaman intension) ke tahat doshi mana he
 At the same time, Nupur has been convicted under sections 201 and 34 besides 302
 court kaa faisla sunate hi rajesh or noopur talwaar ro pade
 Not only this, tears also spilled from the eyes of his family members present in the court
 faisle ke baad donon doshiyon ko giraftaar kar dasna jail bhej diya gaya
 He is provided with blankets, mugs and food utensils in the jail
 iske saath hi donon ko alag-alag cell main rakhaa gaya he
 Following the verdict, a statement was released in the media on behalf of Rajesh and Nupur Talwar, stating that they were unhappy with the verdict
 bayaan ke mutabik, 'ham faisle se bahut dukhi hai
 We have been held responsible for a crime we did not commit
 lekin ham haar nahin maanenge or nyaay ke liye ladaai jari rakhenge
 "A relative of the Talwar couple said after the verdict," What was the need of the trial
 logon ko pehle se pataa tha kya hone vaala he
 To preserve the dignity of the CBI, truth was suppressed in layers of lies
 ' udhar, bachaav paksh ke vakil ne is faisle ko galat mana he
 He said that it is illegal
 talwaar danpati kii vakil rebeka jon ne kaha he ki ve faisle ke khilaaf hoicourt main apil karenge
 Look at the pictures: When the attack on Rajesh Talwar hit and turned the needle of suspicion, the CBI was also accused, with different arguments of Uttar Pradesh Police and CBI, there were many ups and downs in this case
 shuruyaat main shaq kii sui rajesh talwaar par, jabaki uske baad unke mitron ke gharelu sahaayakon par or phir rajesh or unki patni noopur talwaar par gai
 The matter has been in the media since the beginning, due to which in August 2009, the Supreme Court banned the sensational reporting of the media
 vahiin, talwaar dampati ne sibiai par aarope lagaaya tha ki jaanch ko modane or kathith rup se kai chizon ko li karke unki chhavi ko 'nuksaan' pahunchaaya gaya
 Father Rajesh Talwar is under suspicion Initially, Uttar Pradesh Police conducted their investigation on the basis that Hemraj killed Aarushi and then escaped from the scene
 agle din hemraj kaa shav flats kii chat par milane ke baad shaq kii sui aarushi ke pita rajesh talwaar par aa gai, jise uttar pradesh police ne giraftaar kar liya
 This arrest by the police and that sensational allegation caught the attention of the media that the killer is none other than the teenager's father, who stepped in anger after seeing Aarushi and Hemraj in an objectionable position
 iske baad tatkaaleen mukhyamantri mayawati ne maamle kii jaanch sibiai ko saunp di
 a CBI team led by CBI Joint Director Arun Kumar concluded that the killings were carried out by Vijay Thadrai, an assistant at Talwar's clinic, Vijay Mandal, his friend Rajkumar and Talwar's neighbor's driver
 rajkumaar talwaar ke mitra praphul or anitha kaa gharelu sahaayak tha
 Ashwini Kumar, the then director of CBI, dismissed the conclusion and pointed out the flaws in Arun Kumar's pleas
 sitambar 2009 main kumaar ne sanyukt nideshak javed ahamed or tatkaaleen police adheekshak nilaam kishor ke netritv main ek nayi team kaa gathan kiya or unhen apni team ke sadasyon kaa chunaav karne kii aazaadee di
 The investigation team freed the assistants from suspicion after nearly a year of intensive investigation and indicated the role of Rajesh Talwar on the basis of circumstantial evidence
 adaalaton ke chakkar katate rahe rajesh or noopur talwarzaanch dal ne 29 disambar 2010 ko maamle main 'aparyaapt saboot' kaa hawala dete hue maamle ko band karne kii report daayar kii
 This was dismissed by District Magistrate Preeti Singh
 unhone aadesh diya ki isamen talwaar dampati ke khilaaf maamla chalaaya janaa chahie
 The court said, "in a case in which the incident happened inside the house, the visible evidence cannot be ignored
" ' talwaar dampati uske baad elahabaad hoicourt gaye, jisane nichali adaalat ke saman or unke khilaaf shuru kii gai sunwaayee ko radd karne kii maang vaali unki yachika khaarij kar di
 The couple approached the Supreme Court, but they were not relieved there either
 sunwaayee kaa silsilaahatya maamle main sunwaayee 11 june 2012 ko shuru hui
 The trial lasted for one and a half years and during this time CBI legal advisor RK Saini produced 39 witnesses in his support
 vahiin, bachaav paksh ne bhi saat gavaah pesh kiye
 On 25 January 2011, a young man also attacked Rajesh Talwar with a sharp weapon in Ghaziabad court premises
 maamle main abhiyojan ne apni antim daleelein 10 oktober ko shuru kin, jabaki bachaav paksh ne apni antim daleelein 24 oktober ko shuru karke use 12 navambar ko puraa kar liya
 Aarushi massacre So far, on 16 May 2008, after the murder of Aarushi, her father Rajesh Talwar was arrested on 23 May 2008
 is hiprophile cese ne police ko chaka kar rakh diya
 The police kept changing statements repeatedly and the case was unable to reach any conclusion, after which the case was handed over to the CBI on 31 May 2008
 june main rajesh talwaar ke compounder krishna ko sibiai ne giraftaar kar liya gaya
 10 days later, Rajkumar and Vijay Mandal, servants of Talwar's friend, were also taken into custody by the police
 sibiai jaanch kar rahi thi, lekin disbanr 2010 main aakhirkaar sibiai thak gai or closer report yah kehete hue daakhil kii gai ki use rajesh talwaar par hi shaq he, lekin uske khilaaf koi saboot nahin he
 The Talwar couple then moved the court against this closure report
 court ne bhi report ko riject kar diya or ek naatakeey ghatnakram main talwaar danpati ko phir se saman jari kar diya or sibiai ko dobaaraa maamla chalaane kaa aadesh diya gaya
 In February 2011, a special court in Ghaziabad ordered the trial of Rajesh Talwar and Nupur Talwar to be conducted by a CBI court and issued a non-bailable warrant against the Talwar couple for not being present in the court
 april 2011 main nupur talwaar ko giraftaar kar liya gaya
 Finally, in May 2011, the court framed charges against Rajesh Talwar and Napur Talwar for the murder and destruction of evidence
 sitabanr 2011 main nupur talwaar ko jamaanat mil gai
 In April 2013, a CBI official said in court that Aarushi and Hemraj were murdered by the Talwar couple
 sibiai ne court ko ye bhi bataaya ki aarushi or hemraj aapattijanak avasthaa main mili the
 The defense counsel appealed before the special court on 3 May to summon 14 hawahs to the court
 sibiai ne is apil kaa virodh kiya
 On 6 May 2013, the trial court rejected Talwar's application
 saath main rajesh or noopur ke bayanon ko record karne ke bhi aadesh die
 On May 13, the Supreme Court struck down the Talwar couple, rebuking their application
 kul milakar taarikh badhati gai or aakhirkaar lambey intjaar ke baad aarushi or hemraj ko nyaaya mil hi gaya

 Before starting any auspicious work or in order to achieve success in some work, people often do poojas at home so that they can get success in their goals
 par kya aap jaanate hai aapaki manokamana jaldi puri ho sake iske liye ghar main puja paath or mangalik utsav karne kaa kya he sahi tarika
 Let us know what to keep in mind while reciting poojas
 ghar main puja paath kaa sahi sthaan kya ho-- ghar main hameshaa purv yaa uttar disha main hi mandir kaa sthaan rakhen
 - The temple of the house should always be made of wood
 - ghar ke mandir ke aasapaas koi gandagi naa ho
 Always keep it clean and tidy
 -ghar ke mandir kaa mukhya rang kya ho-- mandir kaa sahi rang halkaa pilaa yaa naarangi hona chahie
 - Light yellow light should always be used in the home temple
 - mandir main gahare nile rang kaa prayog naa karen
 What should be kept in the temple of the house? - Put light yellow or red colored clothes in the house temple
 - bhagwaan ganpati or mahalakshmi kaa swaroop rakhen
 - Keep a picture of your favorite and your total guru
 - ek tambe ke lote main gangaajal bharkar rakhen
 What are the precautions to be taken while building a house temple - Do not build the house temple in the south west direction
 - mandir ke aasapaas koi gandagi naa ho
 - Do not build the temple near the toilet at all
 - mandir ke aasapaas juute chappal naa rakhen
 In which direction the Bhajan Kirtan should be chanted - Always if the Bhajan Kirtan is performed in the east or north direction by mouth, it is best that the Bhajan Kirtan done in any other direction does not bring enthusiasm in the mind
 - bhajan kirthan karne se pehle bhagwaan mangal murti ke chitra ko hameshaa sthapit karen uske baad hi bhajan kirthan shuru karen
 - In front of the picture of the deity that is being worshiped, light a lamp of cow's ghee and incense must also keep a vessel of water
 bhajan kirthan main baraten ye saavdhaaniyaan-- bhajan kirthan karte samay idhar-udhar kii baton main dhyaan naa den
 Always perform hymn kirtan only by wearing clean and clean clothes
 - bhajan kirthan main shuddh mithai or saaf-suthere falon kaa prayog karen
 - Always use cow's ghee lamp and bhajan of wreath in bhajan kirtan
 ghar main puja paath or jaap kaa puraa fal paane ke liye karen upaay-- ghar main puja paath karte samay shwet gulabi yaa halke pile vastra pahanakar hi puja karen
 Always chant the mantra sitting on a red or yellow seat
 - jaap hameshaa laal chandan kii maala yaa rudraksh kii maala se karen
 - Before starting the chant, Lord Ganpati and Guru and your favorite should be meditated
 uske baad hi jaap shuru karen
 Ways to remove all problems - If there is no reason for discord in the house, then chant Gayatri Mantra 108 times daily
 - ghar main yadi koi biimaar rahata ho to mahamrityunjay mantra kaa jaap karen or shivlinga par kaccha doodh chadhayen
 If there is a shortage of money in the house, offer yellow flowers to Lord Narayana
 - ghar main aapas main pati patni main vivaad ho to sanyukt rup se shiv parvati kaa pujan karen
 - To prevent the entry of negative energy into the house, put a mango leaf bandana on the main door of the house

 Discussions about bitcoin have intensified in the country, but now it is in the headlines for the wrong reasons
 13 disambar ko iskar vibhaag ne tex chori ke andeh main desh bhar main dilli, bangaluru, hyderabad, kochi or gurugram sahit bitcoin ke nau bade exange kaa surveykshan kiya
 According to reports, the Income Tax Department is going to issue notices to 4 to 5 lakh persons investing big money who have been trading through the exchanges of this unregulated virtual currency
 is digital karency ke khilaaf karrwai ke baavjood bitcoin trade bharat main teji se badhata rahaa he
 Industry sources estimate that about 8 million Indians are trading in this digital currency without a central bank or any controller
 bitcoin kaa mulya is saal janvari se 2,000 pratishat bad gaya he or 16 disambar ko ek bitcoin kaa mulya 19,500 dollar (kareeb 12
 5 lakhs
 ) pahunch gaya tha or is tarah vah abhaasi jagat main sabase mahangi karency ban gaya tha
 Reports suggest that the entities governing the financial sector, including the Reserve Bank of India and the Securities Exchange Board of India (SEBI), take action against fraudsters by taking advantage of the gullible investors' safety and lack of regulations
 We will soon make an arrangement
 sutron kaa kahana he ki bitcoin ko haalanki kanoonee nahin mana jaataa he lekin unhen gaiyr-kanoonee bhi ghoshit nahin kiya gaya he or jo log iske madhyam se vyapaar karte hai, unke khilaaf karrwai karne kaa koi upaay nahin he
 Conversely, some people consider bitcoin to be the currency of the future, because it is digital, connecting and free of controllers
 dilli sthit bitcoin exange ethexpe ke sioo or sah-sansthaapak shubhransh raay kehete hai, ''iskar surveykshan bitcoin exenjon ke liye acha he
 The government should start recognizing this business
 "niveshak apane aadhaar card or pan card kii jaankariyaan dekar bitcoin exenjon par khaataa khol sakate hai or bitcoin kharidne yaa nijee wolet kholane ke liye apane bank khaaton kaa istemaal kar sakate hai
 Transactions from this wallet to other digital wallets are done using a private key
 raay kehete hai, ''agar yah gaiyr-kanoonee he to sarkaar ke paas is kaarobaar ko pratibandhit karne ke saare adhikaar hai
 "according to experts, the government may be thinking of taxing bitcoin in the future
 ise duniya bhar main bade exenjon se pahchaan mil rahi he, jinamein nasdac bhi shaamil he
 In March 2017, the Finance Ministry set up a multi-disciplinary committee to take stock of the virtual currency situation in India and the world and to suggest suggestions on how to deal with it
 samiti apni report saunp chuki he or mana ja rahaa he ki mantralay uski jaanch kar rahaa he
 Given the dangers and volatility in its business (if its value can skyrocket within a few hours, it can dive into a shock), there is a possibility that bitcoin may soon come under the scrutiny of the government
 yah saavdhaanee jaruri bhi he kyonki desh ke aarthik halaat main sudhaar kii halki ummid ke bich koi bhi khatre se khelnaa nahin chahega

 Afzal's cousin Yasin Guru in Sopore told NDTV, "we have not been given any information by the government

 Our lawyers and friends in Delhi also did not know anything about this

 It was said on behalf of the government that information regarding the execution of Afzal Guru was sent to his family members through speed post, but the family denied receiving any such letter

 duniya kii sabase badi khel adaalat ‘court of arbitreshan for sport’ (siees) ne mangalvaar ko rus kii diggaj mahila tennis khilaadi maaria sharapova par doping ke kaaran lagaae gaye pratibandh ko kam kar diya
 The CAS, while hearing Sharapova's petition against the ban, reduced the two-year ban imposed by the International Tennis Federation (ITF) independent tribunal to 15 months
 samachar agency tas ke mutabik, rus tennis mahasang (artief) ke adhyaksh shamil tarapischev ne kaha ki sharapova agle saal 26 april tak tennis court main laut aaengi
 a copy of the verdict has been aired on the CAS website on Tuesday
 unhone kaha, ‘pratibandh kaa kam ho janaa acha he
 Since Sharapova is a clean player, she (CAS) considered our appeal
 ’rio main nahin khel pai thim sharapovaartief adhyaksh ne kaha, ‘yah puri tarah un par nirbhar he ki kya vah apane khel ke puraane str ke saath vaapasi kar paati hai yaa nahin
 "he, however, wants us to play for the national team and win a medal in the next Olympics
" ’ itief ne aath june ko doping kii doshi paae jane par sharapova par do saal kaa pratibandh lagaaya tha
 The Russian player filed an appeal against the ban on June 9 at the CAS
 is pratibandh ke kaaran world kii purv number-1 khilaadi rio olympic-2016 main hissaa nahin le pai thim
 Sharapova, who had been taking a banned drug for 10 years, said that Sharapova, who had won the Grand Slam title five times, was found guilty of consuming meldonium during the Australian Open this year, following which the ITF banned her
 haalanki siees ne apane faisle main spasht kar diya he ki sharapova par 15 maheene kaa pratibandh lagu hoga, jo 26 janvari, 2016 se mana jayega
 The CAS has decided to deprive them of any win or world rankings earned by Sharapova on 26 January 2016
 sharapova ko ummid thi ki itief unke pratibandh ko lekar koi samaadhaan nikaalega
 After the decision of CAS, Sharapova wrote on her Facebook, 'I took responsibility from the beginning that i have consumed the substance which has been banned for the last 10 years
 ’anya mahasanghon se sabak le itfsarapova ne likhaa he, ‘lekin mujhe yah bhi pataa chalaa ki anya mahasang kitne achche tareeke se apane khilaadiyon ko niyamon main badlaav ke bare main bataate hai, khaskar purvi europe main jahaan miladronet lakhon logon dwaara upyog main liya jaataa he

 Why Kannauj's perfume is special - The special thing is that the world's most expensive perfume is made in Kannauj
 yahaan ke itr kii log bechaini or tanaav se bachane ke liye bhi khushboo lete hai
 Kannauj's perfume is full of the qualities of nature

 pradhanmantri manmohan singh or pakistani raashtrapati zaradaari ke bich is mulaaqaat main zaradaari ko bilkul bhi andaja nahin tha ki shuruyaat main unpar kya daaga jane vaala he
 The two leaders entered the room, sitting face-to-face, amidst the noise of TV and still cameras, Zardari kept on saying that Manmohan would say, 'I am very happy to meet you, but i want to tell you that my mandate will tell you It is to be told that Pakistan's land should not be used for cross-border terrorism
 ' phir kya tha? zaradaari sann
 
 
 Pakistani delegation shocked
 
 
 khud media bhi sann, kyonki aam taur par narm or khamoshi se kaam karne vaale manmohan ne pehali baar is tarah saarvajanik taur par koi tippanee kii hogi
 Read: The puzzle of Hafiz Saeed and pakistan-india and Pakistan relations and Zardari Manmohan's meeting on Sunday need to be seen in this context
 haalanki yah aakhri baar nahin tha, jab pradhanmantri manmohan singh ke is bebaak rukh ke janata rou-ba-rou hui thi
 You will remember, in a press conference shared with US President Obama, he also said, 'we are not in the profession of stealing people's jobs
 
 
 ' sab jaanate hai ki bharat main naukariyaan outsource karne ke mudde ko lekar obama kaa rukh tathakthith taliban se kam nahin he
 Read: To die is to die
 
 
 magar is baar phir mulaaqaat he
 a long time has passed since June 16, 2009 and April 8, 2012, so both sides see a sincere initiative to improve relations, and intent is visible
 haalanki is saafaniyati ke peeche kii vajah ko bhi samajhnaa hoga
 After all, why does Pakistan want to normalize trade relations with India? After all, why power is being demanded from Indian Punjab? Why is India trying to give the status of most favored nation incomplete? It is not difficult to understand the intentions of India
 darasal, bharat ke pradhanmantriyon ke itihaas main manmohan singh bharat-paak sambandhon main ek khaas mukaam hasil karne ke khwaahish rakhana chaahate hai
 It is also a joke that often Manmohan Dil wants to win the Nobel Peace Prize for improving indo-pak relations
 
 
 or is mazaaq main bhi sachai dabi ho, to hairat na hogi
 Read: Baitullahsch was like 'bloodbiz', that if indo-pak relations have progressed after the 26 / 11 attacks, then Manmohan's special initiative has been a big reason behind it
 iske liye unhen aksar samrik birdari or siyaasi birdari main aalochana sahanaa padhaa he, magar unki chaal main koi tehraav nahin
 Many times, he has given his passion to this by ignoring the ground reality and criticism has started from here too
 magar sawaal yah he ki pakistan ke rukh main pichley kuch dinon main parivartan kyon? aakhir kyon vah ab kashmir ko pare rakhkar vyapaar or saanskrithik sambandhon ko behatar karne kii baaten kar rahaa he? kyon pehali baar donon deshon ke sambandhon main kashmir kaa mudda haaavee nahin he? iskaa ek durbhagyapurna parinaam yah he ki mumbai hamalon main bharat main rukh kii sakhti bhi jaati he
 You must have noticed that Home Minister Chidambaram himself said that the issue of Hafiz Saeed will not be allowed to dominate Zardari's yatra
 magar ham waapas vahi sawaal karenge
 The question is why the attitude of Pakistan softened? The answer is quite clear
 pehali or sabase ahm baat
 
 
 In the last one year, pak-american relations are seen going into the abyss very fast
 america or pakistan ke kootnithik sambandhon main jis tarah kii giravat aayi he, usase yah saafe ho gaya he ki ab america pakistan ko bagaiyr shart belout nahin karegaa
 That is, the border with Afghanistan was a headache for him, Pakistan does not want tension along the border with India
 uski aarthik haalat bhi behad tang he
 He knows that normal relations with India will open doors for many other countries, the boundary of which is not adjacent to him
 zaraa saamaanya sambandhon se pakistan ko kya phayda hoga, is par gaur karen
 How much the power grid and oil pipeline between the two Punjab will reduce its energy needs cannot be estimated
 wagha or ataari main vyapaar main khulepan aane ke baad pakistani punjab main khaasaa utsaah he
 
 
 And if the avenues are opened in the field of banking and investment, then the icing on the cake
 agar wagha khul gaya he, to gujarat sindh or rajasthan sindh kaise peeche rah sakate hai? bataaya ja rahaa he ki bijness visa ko or aasaan banane ke peeche pakistan khaasaa jor daal rahaa he
 What needs to be said is that who needs business more, especially when the old hammams start appearing
 
 
 bharat ko isi avasar par apni baat ko sadhana hoga
 This is an opportune moment for Pakistan to raise its concerns on the issue of terrorism with utmost seriousness and caution
 ek haath le, to ek haath de
 
 
 There is a philosophy of diplomacy
 ham jaanate hai ki iesai or sena kii shah ke chalate hafeez said bhartiya jelon kii mehmaannawaaji kaa lutf itani aasaani se nahin uthaaenge, magar yah mauka sahi he
 There is tremendous pressure on the Pakistan Army and the ISI itself, and now even the democratically elected Geelani government is showing it its eyes
 to kehane kaa arth yah he ki pakistan badal rahaa he or isamen uski niyat nahin, uski majaburi he
 We have to take advantage of this compulsion
 main maanata hum ki jis mulk kii sena bharat ko hazaar zakhm dekar khun bahaane ke aadhikarik falsafe main vishwaas rakhti ho, yah parivartan itani jaldi or aasaani se nahin aa saktaa, magar jab aapasi hit jud jaaen, to yah mushkil bhi nahin hoga
 a whole generation is changing in Pakistan

 When Mamata Banerjee felt that it would be harmful to continue with the disenchanted Congress anymore, she assumed the role of Commander of Opposition
 unhone khule aam vah baat kah di jise congress ke duusare sahyogi akele main maanane lage hai
 Mamta is not reticent but her expressions speak more than her sentences
 ve apana samarthan waapas lekar sarkaar to nahin gira pain lekin uske vishwaas kii hawa jarur nikaal di or raajnneeti ko chunaav ke raste par laa diya
 Four days after Mamata was formally separated from the government, Congress President Sonia Gandhi said that the UPA government is stable
 kuch hi ghanton baad upie ke sabase mahatvapurn sahyogi dal ensipi ke pramukh sharad pavaar ne maharashtra main sarkaar ko hilaanaa shuru kar diya
 The local quarrel between the Congress and the NCP suddenly boiled over

 On the same day in Tamil Nadu, the Congress's close friend DMK sent Prime Minister Manmohan Singh through his messenger to say that he did not want to give any new name for the proposed change of the cabinet

 The UPA is breaking away from the timber who had joined it

 This tone is for the Congress and not for the UPA
 upie kii patavaar tut chuki he or congress apane chunavi compas ko phir se set karne kii koshish main he
 The formal opposition is no longer an issue of how long a government lasts because the longer the government cannot rule, the worse it will be for it
 congress ko bahes ke mudde ko badalane ke liye vakt kii darkaar he or vah aakhri vakt tak intjaar karegi
 But this party is so old that it does not understand that a government with an uncertain majority cannot work or that every rebellion crisis like Ajit Pawar will enhance its corruption image

 It is common opinion that the BJP lost the elections in 2004 because its 'india Shining' campaign exposed the plight of the poor and the poor told the BJP that they still own the election day
 lekin vot daalane ke din se pehle hi bijepi mahatvapurn jang haar chuki thi jab unhone apni hekdi main haryana main omprakash chautaala, jharkhand main shibu sorain, or assam main agypi jaise apane paaramparik sahyogiyon ko naaraaz kar diya tha
 When politics is so fragmented, it makes a different strand
 congress ne apana ek mukhya sahyogi kho diya he or anya do ko naaraaz kar diya he
 Those who are now supporting the government, Mulayam Singh Yadav and Mayawati will be very strong against them in the elections
 agar congress yaa bijepi agle aam chunaav main vijayi hona chaahati hai to unhen aaj apni hekdi chhodani hogi
