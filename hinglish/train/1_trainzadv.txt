 It was believed that Mulayam Singh would take a big political decision, but Netaji turned all speculations on
 aise main ab shivpal yadav khud press conference karne ke liye utarane kaa faisla kiya he

 shivpal yadav mulaayam ke sahare akhilesh ko siyaasi maat dene kii koshish kar rahe the, lekin netaji ne akhilesh ke khilaaf jaakar koi kadam nahin uthaaya
 Netaji held a press conference on Monday at Lohia Trust
 mana ja rahaa tha ki vah koi bada faisla lenge
 Not only this, he can also take the step of forming a separate party
 netaji jab press conference karne utre to saare kayaason par pani pher diya
 He attacked the Yogi government and then appealed to the people to strengthen the Samajwadi Party
 yahaan mulaayam singh ne alag party banane se saaf inkaar kar diya
 Shivpal now feels that he is going to fight his own battle
 isi maddenjar unhone press conference karne kaa faisla kiya
 In such a situation, it is believed that Shivpal will take a big decision in front of journalists himself

 Gradually the atmosphere in the party is becoming Kumar Vishwas and Arvind Kejriwal
 abhi haal hi main dilli ke ramlila maidan main party kii badi baithak hui thi, jisamen arvind kejariwal ne gujarat chunaav main bijepi ko haraane ke liye vot dene kii apil kii thi

 kumaar vishwaas ke mutabik, 'aisa kuch tay nahin hua he, arvind apane aap main ek nijee ikai hai
 It is our right to agree and disagree with Arvind's personal view

 Kumar further said, 'I am not questioning the privacy of Arvind, he came directly and spoke
 magar main saaf kahuun ye party kaa nirnay nahin he
 Many activists were uncomfortable with this, many are asking me what to say on this statement of Arvind

 Many people were angered by the statement of the Dalit Deputy Chief Minister in Punjab

 But nothing will be gained from this
 ham lagaataar kai chunaav haare hai, isliye ham logon ne andolan chalaaya tha hamen waapas lautnaa chahie
 On Aam Aadmi Party's alliance with Lalu Yadav, Kumar Vishwas said, 'lalu ji fought against dynasty in 1977, he has reached the politics of son and daughter today, it is not possible to think that we will fight with him 
 anna andolan kaa kaaryakarta or party kaa sansthaapak sadsy kumaar vishwaas puri jimmedaari ke saath kah rahaa he ki jabatak main hum ham lalu ji ke saath koi elins nahi karenge
 lalu-nitish went to Arvind at the swearing-in
 i was not asked or told that it was his personal decision
 main to kisi pad par hum nahi bhaiya, magar chif ministar ke protocol hote hai
 'I will definitely say that in this country, the desire for alliance of power in the name of communalism and secularism is in the blood of the leaders of this country
 ramvilas paswan ko jab bijepi ke saath sarkaar banani hoti he to gaiyr congresavad ke saath aate hai or jab congress kaa saath chaahate hai to sampradayikta virdohi ho jate hai
 It is useless to play these two cards of secularism and communalism, which the Congress and its allies party on the word "secularism", the BJP and its partner party in the name of deceit nationalism

 Owaisi's attack on Home Minister Shah lied about the situation in Kashmir
 AIMIM Chief Asaduddin Owaisi has targeted Union Home Minister Amit Shah
 unhone kaha he ki grih mantri jammu-kashmir main sthiti saamaanya hone kaa daawa karte hai agar isamen sachai he to jammu-kashmir main aghoshit apatkaal jaisi sthiti kyon he, sanchaar vyavastha thap kyon he?ovaisi ne kaha ki grih mantri hone ke naate amit shah ko jhooth nahin bolnaa chahie
 Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad had to go to Supreme Court to go to Jammu and Kashmir, Mehbooba Mufti's daughter had to go to court, CPM leader also had to go to court
 auwaisi ne kaha ki amit shah ne sansad main bhi jhooth bolaa he
 India and the Union are not synonymous with each other
 Owaisi said that India and the Union are not synonymous with each other
 unhone kaha ki sangh samaveshi vichaardhaara main vishwaas nahin karata he
 It describes its religion better than others
 unhone kaha ki sangh bharat ko hindu raashtra bananaa chahta he
 He also reacted to the death sentence of Balwant Singh Rajoana, the killer of former CM Beant Singh of Punjab by the Home Ministry, to life imprisonment
 ovaisi ne kaha ki kya bijepi aatankwaad se isi tarah se muqabla karti he
 Responding to the flood of people of Bihar with the question of bjp-nitish, AIMIM MP Owaisi said that the people of Bihar have the right to ask BJP and Nitish Kumar what they have done in the last 15 years
 unhone kaha ki ye pehali baar he ki centre sarkaar rigerv bank se paisa le rahi he

 The Aam Aadmi Party has once again targeted BJP and PM Modi on the decision of demonetisation
 'aap' ke mutabik modi sarkaar ne notebandi ke 8 lakh karod rupee ke ghotaale ke saath-saath desh kii janata ke saath bahut bada dhokhaa kiya he
 Just before the introduction of demonetisation scheme, big leaders of BJP not only purchased huge land in Bihar while hiding their black money, but Kerala has also joined this link
 aap netaa dilip pandey ne aarope lagaaya he ki bijepi netaaon ne deshbhar main kul 27 jagahon par jaminen kharidi hai or apane kaledhan ko notembdi se pehle hi thikaane laga diya tha
 The purchase of lands at such a huge level by BJP leaders using both cash and check payments just before demonetisation proves that the top leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party had come to know about the demonetization scheme beforehand
 And it is clear that the Prime Minister has misused his position and the government to provide such confidential information to the leaders of his party and some of his close ones
 He has betrayed the people of this country and the country by giving it away

 We want to ask Prime Minister Narendra Modi if printing the country's currency is a child's game, if you use a pencil then erase it and say sorry
 RBI had its own credibility in the world but the Modi government has also put it on the track of ruin

 1 year ago, SC did adultery out of the purview of crime
 Sena expressed concern over homosexuality in order to ensure discipline
 Homosexuality and non-marriage related adultery on behalf of the Supreme Court in different judgments last year Carried out of scope
 ek saal baad sena kii ore se aise vikalpon ko talash kiya ja rahaa he jisase ki sena main anushaasan sunishchit karne ke liye samalangikta or edltary dandaneey aparaadh bane rahen
 Homosexuality and Adults in 'indecent Conduct'? The outgoing Adjutant General of the Indian Army, Lieutenant General Ashwini Kumar, clarified the situation on the issue on Wednesday, a day before retirement, saying nothing would be done that violated the orders of the Supreme Court Ho
 unhone kaha, 'supreme court ke faisle jamini kaanoon he or sena unka paalan karegi
 However, Lt Gen Kumar also added that the Army Act was passed by Parliament and provisions exist to deal with 'indecent conduct' of military personnel
 bataa den ki adjutent general branch sainikon ke kalyaan ke saath hi har str par sanyakarmiyon ke khilaaf sabhi tah kii shikayaton ko bhi dekhtaa he
 Will the Army review the SC decision? Will the Army review the Supreme Court's decision to keep homosexuality and adultery punishable in the Army? In response to this question, Lt Gen Kumar said, 'how do you know that we have not done this yet?' Officials say that keeping homosexuality and adultery punishable will act as deterrent otherwise serious disciplinary issues will arise
 isse cmand or control kii samasya hogi
 According to him, 'we have to think on the atmosphere of the soldiers' barracks
 aisa kuch nahin hona chahie jisase unka manobal neeche ho
 Army Chief General Bipin Rawat has also said in the past that homosexuality and adultery cannot be accepted in the Army
 kya he puraa maamla ?sutron ke mutabik sena ne raksha mantralay ko prativedan dekar sena mensamalangiktaya edltary kaa notice nahin liye jane yaa dand naa die jane ko lekar apni chintaaen jataain
 The Army wants that both these acts should remain an offense punishable under Section 45 of the Army Act
 ye act adhikariyon yaa sainikon ke 'ashobhaneey aacharan' se deal karata he
 Section 45 of the Army Act says- 'an officer, junior commissioned officer or warrant officer shall conduct conduct which is indecent according to his rank or contrary to the character expected of him if convicted in a court martial
 If so, according to the Act, the officer deserves to be removed or punished
 vahiin junior kamishan adhikari yaa warrant adhikari barkhaast hone yaa kam dand paane kaa paatr he jaisaa ki act main zikr he
 ' videsh main ilaaj kara rahe arun jetali kii jagah bajet se ain pehle piyush goyal ko vitt mantralay kaa atirikt prabhaar diya gaya he
 Piyush Goyal has been given this responsibility on the advice of Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 mana ja rahaa ki arun jetali kii beemaari ke chalate ye faisla liya gaya he
 The budget is to be presented on 1 February
 aise main ab ye tay he ki is baar kaa bajet piyush goyal hi pesh karenge
 Jaitley will now be a minister without any health ministry until he is not well
 gauratlab he ki beete hafte vitt mantri arun jetali ko ilaaj ke liye achaanak america kaa rukh karnaa padaa tha
 However, quoting the party and Arun Jaitley himself had said through social media that he would return to the country before the interim budget on 1 February
 iske baavjood raajnneetik galiyaaron main sugabugahat thi ki jetali swasth ke chalate bajet satr main shariq na ho sake
 In such a situation, it was believed that once again Piyush Goyal could be given the charge of Finance Ministry in the Union Cabinet
 lihaaja, is khabar ke baad ab saaf he ki 1 farvari ko kendra sarkaar kaa aakhri bajet spich ko piyush goyal padhenge
 This is not the first time Piyush Goyal has come as a troubleshooter for the party
 isse pehle bhi kai baar piyush goyal mushkil ghadi main party or sarkaar ke kaam aae hai
 Piyush Goyal was given additional charge of the Finance Ministry even when Finance Minister Arun Jaitley was admitted to AIIMS for a kidney transplant
 beemaari ke chalate beete 9 maah main arun jetali ne koi videsh yatra bhi nahin kii thi
 Earlier in September 2014, Arun Jaitley underwent weight loss bariatric surgery at Max Hospital in Delhi
 jetali heart kii bhi surgery kara chuke hai
 He was very active in the party, recovering from illness in the past
 tab mana ja rahaa tha ki ve swasth ho gaye hai
 Recently he gave a very impressive speech in the debate in Parliament on the issue of ten percent reservation for the general class
 unke andaaj ko dekhakar lag rahaa tha ki ve puri tarah swasth ho gaye hai
 But suddenly on Sunday night, he left for America for treatment
 bijepi main sirf jetali hi nahin, goa ke mukhyamantri manohar parrikar bhi gambhir beemaari se jujh rahe hai
 Recently, BJP President Amit Shah also succumbed to swine flu
 iske chalate unhen bhi ames main bhartee hona padaa tha
 However, within a few days, they have recovered and become active again

 endie ke varisht netaa subramanyam swami kaa kahana he ki ram mandir bijepi kaa nahin hindustan kaa agenda he
 He gave the mantra of victory for the 2014 Lok Sabha elections to the NDA and said that if you collect Hindu votes and divide Muslim votes, you will win
 aaj tak ke sidhi baat kaarykram main rahul kanwal se vishesh baatcheet main subramanyam swami ne daawa kiya ki shiya muslim endie ke saath hai
 In response to a question, Subramanian Swamy said- 'we want our vote bank to increase
 meraa to ye maananaa he ki hindu vot bank ko ikattha karo or musalmaan vot bank ko vibhajit karo
 In response to the question whether politics in the name of religion is not dangerous for the country, Subramanian Swamy said- 'why should there not be such politics
 shiya ke saath pakistan main anyaay ho rahaa he? ham 80 fisadi hindu hai or agar 14 pratishat musalmaan main se 7 pratishat hamaare saath aa bhi jaaenge to ye khataranaak kaise ho jayega
 We want to convince Muslims and today Shias and many Muslims are with us
 aaj muslim samudaay vibhajit ho gaya he
 After all, on the question of why Modi called himself a Hindu nationalist, Subramanian Swamy said- 'someone asked Modi the question whether you are a Hindu nationalist
 to unhone kaha ki haa, main hindu bhi hum or rashtravaadi bhi hum
 Therefore, i am a Hindu nationalist
 modi ne ye bayaan diya tha
 On Amit Shah's statement regarding construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya, Subramanian Swamy said - 'ram temple has always been on the agenda of BJP and NDA
 bijepi or endie main koi fark nahin he
 Both are of the same opinion
 mandir to bananaa hi he
 i say that this is the agenda of India
 endie kaa to daayitv keval use nibhaane kaa he
 In response to a question, Subramanian Swamy said- 'if Narendra Modi becomes Prime Minister in 2014, BJP will build Ram temple in Ayodhya
 wo kanoon ke anusaar mandir ko banavaayenge or musalaamanon ko bhi manaayenge
 "instead of Congress's failure, there is talk of secularism and communism about Modi, on this question, Subramanian Swamy said -" There is no mention of temple in Narendra Modi's speeches

 y bihar ke nagar vikaas mantri suresh sharma or unke samarthakon ke dwaara pashchim bengal ke tarapith ke ek hotel main kathith rup se kii gai gundgardee ke mudde par bolte hue purv upmukhyamantri tejasvi yadav ne kaha he ki jis tareeke se suresh sharma or unke logon ne hotel ke logon ke saath gundgardee or utpaat machaaya he, usase bihar kii chhavi ko kaaphi nuksaan pahunchaa he
 Tejashwi said that due to the works of a minister like Suresh Sharma who promoted the hooliganism of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, Bihar's image has become bad in the country
 tejasvi ne kaha ki is puure maamle par bhaajapai cote ke mantriyon ke sargana yani upmukhyamantrisushil kumaar modimunh chhipaaen dubake baithe hai
 Tejashwi asked the question why Sushil Modi's discourse about hooliganism and jungle raj has stopped at every moment on the issue of Suresh Sharma? Tejashwi for alleged hooliganism committed by Suresh Sharma and his people at Tarapith hotel Said that Suresh Sharma is saying after the incident that the West Bengal government did not give him the circuit house despite the application
 tejasvi ne poocha ki kya suresh sharma ne pashchim bengal sarkaar se circuit house main rahane ke liye aavedan kiya tha ? tejasvi nitish kumaar se aise mantri ko turant prabhaav se apane mantrimandal se barkhaast karne kii maang kii
 Tejashwi asked many questions about this whole issue: -why did the minister finally make the online booking at the hotel on December 30? - Did Suresh Sharma fax his program to someone or talk to a protocol officer? You took the permission of the administration before the security personnel were taken to another state? -if the minister took the permission then where is that permission? Shakrmi not scare each other by Suresh Sharma people in the state about? Do not know -what Minister Suresh Sharma that if the hotel is made of on-line booking his collection amount will also be online? In such a situation, what does it mean to beat up hotel staff? -if Minister Suresh Sharma is telling himself to be so immaculate then why not get his medical examination done? -the minister should tell that his supporters in CCTV who are beating hotel staff , tejasvi ne sawaal poocha ki kya susheel modi suresh sharma ko apni party bhaajapa se barkhaast karenge ? By the way, the record of scoring the lowest balls in T20 cricket is named after South Africa's Richard Levy (45 balls)
 isi team ke fof duplasis bhi 46 gendon par shatak jamaakar duusare number par hai
 But Richard Levy at this time
 africa team kaa hissaa nahin he jabaki duplasis aamtaur par madhyakram main ballebaaji karte hai
 In such a situation, it is difficult to reach the figure of 200
 in ballebaajon ke alaava bharat ke viraat kohli, shikhar dhawan, westeindies ke johnson charles or england ke elex helles bhi is jaadui ran sankhya tak pahunchane main sakasham hai
 Similarly, Indian opener KL Rahul has also scored a century off 46 balls like Duplesey recently
 vaise, tii 20 kaa cricket itnaa anischittapurna he ki ho saktaa he, in tamaam ballebaajon se alag, koi nayaa ballebaaj hi 200 kii is ransankhya tak pahunche

 The enthusiastic crowd and especially the youth participated in the scorching heat in response to Lalu's announcement of the overthrow of the NDA government
 yah dikhaata he ki argedy pramukh ke prati abhi unke man kaa vishwaas dola nahin he
 As anticipated, the focus of Lalu's speech was on the eviction of the Nitish government from power
 lalu ne iske liye apni vajahen bhi bataayin
 16 wearing a Namaji cap
 53 pratishat musalaamanon se khud ko sidhe jodgaye kaa prayaas karte hue lalu ne kaha, ''niteesha aresas-bhaajapa jaisi sampradayik takaton ko phayda pahunchaa rahe hai
 He is the head of a highly corrupt government
 ”lalu ne kaha, ''puure bihar se muslim naujavaanon kii aatankwaad main shaamil hone ke bahaane giraftaaryaan Þeen or nitish ne puure maamle se munh mode liya
 "certainly Lalu is hopeful that by making such accusations on the government, he can rebrand the muslim-yadav (SY) equation considered impenetrable
 haalanki yah aadha sach hi he
 Central intelligence agencies have arrested Muslim youth from different parts of Bihar and the country for their involvement in alleged terrorist incidents 
 unhone yah kadam upie-2 kii dekh-rekh main uthaaya he jise abhi tak lalu yadav kaa samarthan hasil he
 Lalu promised to regularize their jobs in the hope of cashing in on the rampant corruption in the state's government departments and the growing resentment in the minds of people against it and the contractual teachers due to low wages
 lalu ne jahaan apni baton par shaq karne kii koi gunjaaish nahin chodi to vahiin nitish kumaar ko satta se bedakhal karne or pradesh ke raajnneetik patal par apni vaapasi karne kii yojana ke bare main koi bhi khulaasa or sanket unhone jaan-boojhkar nahin diya
 It was well known that the second biggest aspect of Lalu's Parivartan rally was the formal announcement of his two sons - Tejashwi and Tej Pratap's entry into politics
 lalu apane donon beton ke raajnneeti main utarane ko jaij tehraane kii koshish bhi karte najar aae
 He questioned very factually, "these are my boys
 isliye ye laalaten uthaa rahe hai
 What else should they do? Should these hold the lotus of the communal BJP or Nitish Kumar's arrow? ” Lalu, while defending on allegations of nepotism, described RJD leaders as part of the RJD family
 lekin lalu kaa yah jawaab raajnneetik galiyaaron main chal rahi fusfusaahat ko shant nahin kar saktaa
 Gandhi Maidan in Patna has actually become the launching pad of Lalu sons and another chapter has been added to the politics of dynasty
 lalu ne manch se vidhansabha chunaav main pachaas fisadi tikat yuvaaon or mahilaon ko dene kaa vaada bhi kiya
 He was cheered on this announcement but perhaps this is the time when the RJD chief needs to be reminded of his promise made six years ago from this place
 saal 2007 main ek chetavanee sabha ko sambodhit karte hue unhone vaada kiya tha ki bihar main argedy satta main ai to ve oonchi jati ke garib tabakon ke liye 10 fisadi aarakshan lagu karenge
 However, the people of Bihar rejected the RJD in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections and the 2010 assembly elections, and in the meantime Lalu forgot his old promises
 in vaadon ke bare main ab ve charchaa tak nahin karte
 After all, now is the time to make new promises
 lalu ne dikhaaya ki na sirf unamem abhi dam-kham baaki he, balki ve usee bhades andaaj se bharpoor hazirajavaab bhi hai
 But the truth is also that the glow of his unique style and gesture is continuously fading and it is not able to get him votes on the day of polling
 unki chutili baaten aaj bhi pasand kii jaati hai lekin yah nishchit he ki thahaake markar unhen sunne vaale log unhen vot nahin de rahe hai
 By the way, this power show of Lalu is being considered the result of disillusionment of the people of Bihar with the Nitish government
 jaahir he, ise lalu ke lokapriyata main ekaek ai kisi oochaal kaa nateeja nahin mana ja saktaa
 It is certainly that his solid base of Yadav votes has been strengthened
 lekin kya yah kaaphi hoga? kya lalu logon ke is mohabhang ko voton main badal paaenge? bihar ke mukhya vipakshi dal ke netaa kii haisiyat se lalu ke paas bheed jutaney kii hnmata to he lekin vah saakh nahin he jisaki is vakt jarurat he
 Lalu thoughtfully named his meeting as Parivartan Rally
 unke liye badlaav kaa matlab sarkaar badalanaa he, lekin shaayad ve yah bhul rahe hai ki beete saalon main bihar bhi kaaphi badal gaya he or is badlaav ke saath unhen bhi badalanaa jaruri he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday, advocating communal harmony, while giving a message amidst hateful statements by leaders of all parties, asked Hindus and Muslims to work together against poverty and ignore the 'irresponsible' statements of leaders

" ’ unhone kaha, ‘kal raashtrapati ne rasta dikhaaya tha
 There can be no message bigger than what the head of the country of 125 crore people said, there can be no greater direction than that, there can be no greater motivation than that
 ’PM modi ne kaha ki desh ke logon ko raashtrapati ke dikhaae raste par chalanaa chahie or ‘tabhi bharat duniya kii apekshaaon ko puraa kar saktaa he
 "the President, while addressing a program on Wednesday, said," i firmly believe that we cannot allow the basic values of our society to go in vain and these basic values are what our society has diversified over the years As elevated and enhanced and advocated tolerance, patience and pluralism
 ’patna ke gandhi maidan main bam visphot ke baad pichley saal diye gayi apane bhaashan ko yaad karte hue modi ne kaha ki unhone khoonkhrabe ke bich bhaichaare or sauhaard kaa sandesh diya tha
 He said that we are moving forward with this vision and culture
 us ghatana ke bare main baat karte hue modi ne bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar par visphoton main jaan ganvaane vaale logon kii chintaa kiye bagaiyr is mudde par raajnneeti karne or ghamand ke kaaran unki tippaniyon par majaak banane ke liye nishaanaa saadhaa
 Describing the grand alliance as a 'mahasarvath alliance', Modi said, it is like a 'big Bass' house where there is a 'big Bass' who claims to be the kingmaker himself and wants everyone to dance at his behest

 It was promised that it would make necessary changes in the policies to create a corruption-free India, separate from the corruption-ridden development model of the Congress
 60 maheenon main modi sarkaar ke 36 maheene puure hone ja rahe hai
 In such a situation, it is necessary to assess how much India changed during this part of the tenure (3 years of Modi) to get on the agenda of freedom from corruption and fast development
 gauratlab he ki modi sarkaar dwaara badlaav kii is muhim kaa daaromadar niti ayog ko diya gaya jise sarkaar ne yojana ayog kii jagah lene ke liye sthapit kiya
 The Central Cabinet was established on 1 January 2015, naming this NITI Aayog as National Institute for Transforming India (NITI)

 Digital India - The central government took a big step in the direction of Digital India to eliminate corruption from the game of development on the Internet
 kaledhan par lagaam lagane or deshbhar main cashles tranjaction ko badhaava dene ke uddeshy se modi sarkaar ne 8 november 2016 conotbandi kaa elaanakarte hue arthvyavastha main sarvaadhik sanchalit 500 or 1000 rupee kii karency ko pratibandhit kar diya
 Along with this, the Central Government launched the Bhima Aadhaar platform to give a boost to the cashless economy, which was intended to encourage small businesses in the country for cashless transactions
 in koshishon ke chalate kendra sarkaar ne april 2017 tak 75 shaharon ko kam cash istemaal ke liye chinhit kiya
 However, after demonetisation, the issue of cash shortage also came up in some parts of the country and the economic data also showed partial impact of demonetisation
 lekin desh or duniya ke zyaadaatar arthshaastriyon ne notebandi se lambii avadhi main phayda milane kaa daawa kiya

 kooparative federlism- team india kaa sapanakendra sarkaar kii koshish rahi ki vah desh main majboot rajyon kaa nirmaan kare jisase ek shashakt bharat bana sakate hai
 For this, the central government played an important role in passing the GST bill towards making the entire country a common market
 gauratlab he ki kendra sarkaar negistike mudde par puure desh main aam sahmati banane main safalataa pai or sabhi rajyon kii sakriyata se antim faisla liya
 Now the central government is trying to give effect to it from July 2017, for which the GST Council (important role of all the states) has been kept as the main character
 ab mana ja rahaa he ki jiesti ko safalataa ke saath lagu karne ke baad desh kii arthvyavastha ko tej gati se badhane kaa mauka milegaa
 Economic experts claim that after GST is fully effective in the whole country, the country may also see double digit growth

 What did women get? The central government started several important schemes during the last three years on the directions of NITI Aayog, which can be said to be important in the direction of empowering women across the country
 in yojanaon main sabase ahm kendra sarkaar dwaara gramin ilaakon main mahilaon ko svachh or surakshit kooking ke liye ujjwala skim ke tahat alpiji muhaiyaa karaane kii thi
 At the same time, under the Jan Dhan Scheme, the Modi government worked to connect women with the mainstream of banking

 lashkar-e-taiba terrorist David Coleman Headley says he was trained in terror by hundreds of ISI officials and 'non-commissioned officers' (ncos) over hundreds of sessions
 hedli ko lahore main iesai kii ek do manjila imaarat main prashikshit kiya gaya tha
 He was taught the skill of hiding his identity here and making a place in the heart of Indians, especially in Mumbai

 After this he was given state-of-the-art training in Lahore

 According to this terrorist, he told the court, 'major Iqbal expressed unhappiness over the training of Lashkar
 usne kaha tha ki yah paryaapt nahin he
 According to Headley's testimony, ISI officials had specially trained intelligence training to prove the truth, the skill of fabricating a false story and the reconnaissance of urban areas
 adaalat main die uske bayaan main kaha gaya he, ‘iesai ke prashikshan main bataaya gaya ki pramukh sthanon kii kis tarah se video banaai jaae, jisase kisi ko shaq na ho
 Other tricks of espionage were also taught
 ’hedli se poocha gaya ki vah pramukh sthanon par kitni der thahartaa tha? usne jawaab diya, ‘har jagah ke liye alag-alag samay tha
 i went to many places hundreds of times
 ’ usase poocha gaya, ‘major ikabal ne tumko jo prashikshan diya he, yah james band se to nahin miltaa he?’ hedli ne iskaa haa main jawaab diya
 Headley said, 'I had to go to India and before that i applied to change my name (daud Gilani)
 ’hedli ke naam badalane kii jaankaree jab major ikbaal ko mili to vah bahut khush hua
 Headley wanted to change his name to India so that no one would get a clue about his plans

 These terrorist organizations cooperate with each other and are fully supported by the ISI
 ’hedli ne kaha ki vah iesai ke adhikariyon ke sankethik shabdon kaa istemaal karata tha
 For example, instead of taking the name of ISI over the phone, he used to call it 'mr

 ek ore jahaan vipaksh ke netaa mil baithkar raashtrapati pad ke chunaav par charchaa kar rahe hai vahiin unamem ek vyakti kii gaiyr maujuudagi kuch or hi kahani kah rahi he
 These are Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, whose message is clear
 jadyu adhyaksh kisi ke ishaare par nahin chalate balki vahi karte hai jo unke mutabik unki party ke liye sahi he
 On Thursday, some opposition leaders spoke to Nitish, whose decision to support the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) presidential candidate Ramnath Kovind has angered many, though Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Lalu Prasad Yadav It is promised that he will convince Nitish to support the opposition candidate Meera Kumar
 mira usee rajya bihar se hai or dalit hai jahaan nitish varsh 2005 se shashan karte aa rahe hai
 Nitish's support to Kovind is one of the surprising steps he has taken recently that has alienated his party from the anti-national Democratic Alliance faction
 jadyu netaa kasee tyaagi ne kaha, ve samay-samay par aise virodhabhasi faisle lete hai, jo unhen lagata he ki janhit main hai
 He is going against the stream in the presidential election to be held on July 17, which was made clear only last month when he did not attend the opposition dinner hosted by Congress President Sonia Gandhi in which the issue was to be discussed
 yahi nahin, iske agle din ve morishas ke pradhanmantri ke liye pradhanmantri narendra modi dwaara yojit bhoj main shaamil hue
 The chief minister has supported the ruling NDA on issues that the opposition criticized, such as the nda's decision to ban surgical strikes in October last year and high-value currency notes in November
 bhaajapa ke saath gathbandhan main shaamil hone ke liye pehle unhone gaiyr-rajg samooh kaa saath choda or phir varsh 2015 ke vidhansabha chunaav main unhone rajg kaa saath chhod uske khilaaf mahagathbandhan banaaya
 In the 2012 presidential election, he surprised the then alliance partner NDA when he supported UPA presidential candidate Pranab Mukherjee against NDA candidate PA Sangma
 bataaya jaataa he ki aisa unhone mukherjee ke saath vyaktigat sambandh hone ke kaaran kiya tha
 The comments haalanki kovind ko samarthan dene ke maamle main, isaki vajah jatigat raajnneeti ho sakati he
 Significantly, there are a large number of Mahadalit voters in Bihar
 rajd vidhayak bhai birendra ne kaha, nitish ko apni party yaa gathbandhan se koi lenadena nahin he
 They do what is good for their personal political interest
 vidhayak kaa yah kahana un atakalon ko majbootee detaa he, jinamein kaha jaataa he ki jadyu or rajd ke bich sabakuch thik nahin he
 LJP leader Ram Vilas Paswan had told Nitish not to ride two boats at the same time and join the NDA, but it seems that the Chief Minister of Bihar will continue to ride as long as he wants
 (hedline ke alaava, is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he, yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he
 ) kovind ko nitish kaa samarthan unke dwaara haal main uthaae gaye un hairat bhare kadamon main se ek he jisane unke dal ko rashtriya janatantric gathbandhan virdohi gut se alag-thalag kar diya he
 JDU leader KC Tyagi said, from time to time, they take such contradictory decisions which they feel are in the public interest
 vah 17 july ko hone vaale raashtrapati chunaav main dhara ke vipareet ja rahe hai, yah baat pichley maheene tabhi saaf ho gai thi jab ve congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi dwaara yojit vipaksh ke bhoj main shaamil nahin hue the jisamen is mudde par charchaa honi thi
 Not only this, the next day he attended a banquet hosted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the Prime Minister of Mauritius
 mukhyamantri ne sattarudh rajg ko aise muddon par samarthan diya he jinaki vipaksh ne aalochana kii, masalan pichley varsh aktubar maah main sargical strike or november main ucch mulya vaale karansi noton par pratibandh kaa rajg kaa faisla
 He first joined the non-nda group to join an alliance with the BJP and then formed a grand alliance against the NDA in the 2015 assembly elections
 varsh 2012 ke raashtrapati pad ke chunaav main unhone tatkaaleen gathbandhan sahyogi rajg ko tab hairat main daal diya tha jab unhone rajg ke ummidavaar pie sangama ke khilaaf samprag ke raashtrapati pad ke ummidavaar pranab mukherjee ko samarthan diya tha
 He is said to have done this because of his personal relationship with Mukherjee
 tippaniyan However, in the case of supporting Kovind, it may be due to caste politics
 gauratlab he ki bihar main mahadalit matadaata badi sankhya main hai
 RJD MLA Bhai Birendra said, Nitish has nothing to do with his party or alliance
 ve vahi karte hai, jo unke nijee raajnneetik hit ke liye acha hota he

 ) congress ne aarope lagaate hue kaha ki adarsh aachaar samhita modi code of conduct (modi aachaar samhita) ban gai he
 The Congress questioned Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP President Amit Shah's silence on the Election Commission over the violations of the code of conduct and said that it could approach the court seeking action against both
 congress ke varisht netaa abhishek manu singhvi ne aarope lagaaya ki donon netaaon ne chunaav ke dauraan sabhi dalon ke liye samaan avasar ke mudde par dhokhaa kiya he
 He questioned the silence of the watchdog and the Election Commission regarding this
 singhvi ne ek samvaadadaata sammelan main kaha ki hamen aachaar samhita ulalanghanon ke liye karrwai kii maang karte hue court kaa rukh karne kaa adhikaar he
 We can use this option
 nigaraneekarta ne apni ankhen band kar lee he
 Singhvi said the silence can be considered as approval
 unhone chunaav ayog par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki congress ko yah kehete hue dukh ho rahaa he ki chunaav ayog ke duusare shabd se 'si' hat gaya he or vah modi-shah jodi ke liye 'ellection omishan' ban gaya he
 He questioned whether Modi and Shah were outside the purview of the code of conduct
 unhone aachaar samhita ko 'modi code of conduct' qaraar diya
 Singhvi claimed that the two leaders had committed a gross violation of the code of conduct in three categories
 inamen voton kaa dhruvikaran, prachaar main sashastr balon kaa zikr karnaa or chunaav vaale din reliyaan karnaa shaamil hai
 He said that on the basis of our complaints the Election Commission has taken action against several leaders for violation of the code of conduct
 ham isaki saraahna karte hai, lekin yahi karrwai modi or shah ke khilaaf kyon nahin kii gai
 Singhvi said that we are sorry to say that this is a question of the jurisdiction of the Election Commission and a model code of conduct, then the modi-shah duo has a kind of open leeway
 unhone kaha ki abhi aise vyakti nahin hue jinhone apane chunavi laabh ke liye chunaav ayog, aachaar samhita or samvidhan ke astitv par ankhen band kar lee hon
 Singhvi said that i had argued the Election Commission on three categories - hate speeches, armed forces and campaigning during voting
 unhone uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ke maamle kaa zikr karte hue kaha ki chunaav ayog ne inamen se do muddon par aadesh paarit karte hue prachaar gatividhiyon par roak lagaai thi
 The commission had banned Yogi from campaigning for 72 hours
 singhvi ne aage kaha ki pichley 25 dinon se vah nijee taur par kam se kam 15 pratinidhimandal kaa netritv karte hue ayog pahunche
 He urged the commission to follow its own orders and precedents while looking into complaints against Modi and Shah
 congress netaa ne singhvi kaha ki is desh main do kanoon hai, ek pradhanmantri or amit shah ke liye or doosraa anya ke liye
 He said that is why we are now complaining to the Election Commission when the water has risen above our heads
 unhone kaha ki bharat ke log is niskriyata ke liye, is chuppi ke liye ayog se jawaab kii maang karte hai or hamaare paas jitani shakti he uske madhyam se ham koshish bhi kar rahe hai, saath hi unhone kaha ki jarurat padi to ham adaalat kaa darwaja khatkhata sakate hai, lekin mudda yah he ki chunaav ayog kuch bhi kyon nahin kar rahaa he
 To a question about Congress leader PC Chacko and Shatrughan Sinha's alleged remarks on Yasin Malik and Mohammad Ali Jinnah, Singhvi said Sinha has made his remarks clear and it would be better if Chacko is contacted directly on the issue

 The split in the NDA in Bihar has been settled, the formal announcement remains
 bijepi or jediu donon hi maan chuke hai ki ab raahen juda ho gayi hai
 Today, Janata Dal United leaders have a meeting at around 12:30 pm in Patna and the party will tell the media about the decisions decided in the meeting at 3 pm
 8 saal se saath sarkaar chalaa raheen partia ab apni apni siyaasi rahon par aage badhengi
 BJP trusts Modi and Nitish opposes Modi
 jediu dharmanirpekshata kii duhai de rahi he, najar muslim votaron par he
 The BJP has gone so far in the name of Modi that it is not possible to return now
 yahi vajah he ki donon hi partiyon kaa kendriya netritv is tut ke peeche khud ko majaboor dikhaane kii koshish kar rahaa he
 If the alliance breaks down, the friendship, which lasts more than one and a half decade and a half, is a privilege
 bijepi or jediu ke rishton main itani kadavaahat ghul chuki he ki ab to saath tootna tay lag rahaa he
 There is such a screw called Modi that the coalition is unable to resolve it
 jediu baar-baar kah rahi he ki modi unhen katai manjuur nahin, or ab bijepi ne bhi apane tevar kade karte hue saaf kar diya he ki modi ke naam vito bardaasht nahin
 JDU leader Shivanand Tiwari said, 'now there is scope for doubt in the scene
 nitish kumaar ji ne shuukravaar ko jo sher padhaa usase saaf ho gaya he
 Some decision will be taken by Sunday
 udhar bijepi netaa nand kishor yadav ne kaha, 'nerendra modi ji rashtriya netaa hai, uskaa phayda milegaa
 On the basis of the veto of a party, we insult our leader is not right
 jediu ko pataa he ki saath tutaa bhi to sarkaar par khatra nahin, aakade haq main hai
 The election also has two and a half years
 nitish ko bharosa he ki dhai saal main puure bihar ke votaron kaa rujhaan wo apni ore khinch lenge
 BJP has a sense of deceit in this trick of Nitish
 jediu netaa sanjay kumaar singh ne kaha, 'bahumat kaa sawaal he to 118 vidhayak to hamaare saath hai hi, or nirdaleey vidhayakon kaa hamen hameshaa saath mila he
 At the same time, former BJP state president Gopal Narayan Singh said, 'we already knew that this alliance is not going to last long, because Nitish ji adopts the policy of Use and Throw, when he felt that our personality is now Having grown up, he had a misunderstanding a year ago that now the whole of Bihar is going towards him
 tabhi se wo alag hatane lage the
 The national leadership is not as strong as the leaders of Bihar
 jediu adhyaksh bhi rishta tuutane kaa ishaara to kar rahe hai lekin baatcheet kii gunjaaish chodi hui he
 On the other hand, BJP is also saying that we want to preserve the alliance
 naa modi ke naam par bijepi peeche hategi, or naa hi jediu modi ke naam par samjhauta kar paaegi
 Both are compelled for their own vote bank
 aise main baithken chaahe jitani ho jaae, baatcheet chaahe jitani ho jaae lekin itnaa to tay lag rahaa he ki ab ye dosti nahin tikegi
 What are the options with the BJP? When another state power was seen slipping out of hand, there was uneasiness till Delhi
 centre kii satta kii aas main modi ko chunavi rath kaa sarathi banaaya to bihar main 17 saal puraane saathi bidak gaye
 JDU has expressed that it is not acceptable to Modi at all
 aise main bijepi ke samaane do raste hai
 Either he retreated on Modi's issue and joined the government by becoming the number two party in Bihar as before
 doosraa ye ki wo bihar main satta kaa moh philhal choden or centre kii siyasat par nazren gadaayen
 It seems that the strategy so far has been that the BJP has made up its mind to take another route
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki modi virodh main apni secular chhavi chamakaane kii koshish main jute nitish kumaar kii chhavi par hi hamalaa kar rahi he bijepi
 The party leaders are asking how Nitish, who was with Modi during the Gujarat riots, is now seen as communal? BJP ministers left work
 There are also signs from the bjp's Bihar unit
 baithkon kaa daur jari he
 Some ministers, including Sushil Kumar, have left work
 nitish kumaar ne mantriyon ko milane kaa jo nyauta bheja tha use bhi bijepi ke mantriyon ne thukraa diya he
 The BJP is also giving this message that it does not want the alliance to break
 party kaa daawa he ki ye tut bihar kii janata ke liye thik nahin
 bjp's objective is clear
 party nahin chaahati ki is foot kaa jimmedaar use tehraaya jaae

 When asked about the speculation being made about the separation of BJP and JDU due to statements made by Nitish Kumar during the last few times, he said, "we and none of you have seen tomorrow
" jivan kaa thikaana nahin rahata, to baaki chizon kaa kya thikaana
 After the Janata Durbar held at Patna Chief Minister's Housing 1, Anne Road, Nitish told reporters, "we have a coalition of people
" unhone kaha jediu or bijepi kaa gathbandhan lambey samay se chalaa aa rahaa he or gathbandhan main shaamil ghatak dalon kaa alag-alag drushtikon or unki apni-apni raajnneetik disha hoti he

 unhone kaha ki sabhi dal samay-samay par apane kaaryakramon kaa ullekh karte hai or gathbandhan main sabhi baton ko dhyaan main rakhkar un par charchaa kii jaati he

 Asked about the future of the NDA when the BJP made Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi its prime ministerial candidate, Nitish said, "we should not talk in agar-magar"
 nitish ne modi kaa unka naam liye bina kaha ki khagadiya main sabha main kuch pradarshnakariyon ke gaiyr-anushaasit krity ke baavjood unhone apni sabha jari rakhi thi or madhubani main aagjanee or hinsa kii ghatana ke kaaran vahaan kii vidhi-vyavastha kii samiksha ke liye adhikaar yatra ko radd kiya tha
 The comments gauratlab he ki narendra modi ne nitish kaa naam liye bina ravivaar ko kaha tha ki lokapriyata kaa daawa karne vaale mukhyamantri ko pradarshnakariyon ke chalate yatra radd kerani padi thi
 When asked by BJP workers in Gopalganj during Nitish's Seva Yatra to put up a poster showing Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi as the Prime Ministerial candidate, he said that he does not pay attention to who puts the poster, etc

 Sadar's other businessman, Praveen Kumar, has ordered the swipe machine for the last 15 days but the machine has not come yet, now how to make cashless payment in such a situation
 unhone kaha ki iske alaava kai aise customer hai jo sidhe sidhe cash main hi deal karnaa chaahate he kyonki unhen digital nolej hi nahi hai
 Naval, a trader of sports goods, also has the option of paytm for his business, but still wants to deal with the customer in cash as the deal in the bargain gives a chance of bargaining

 Overall, Sadar, running at 100% cash, has lost 2 to 3 percent cashless, but in spite of this the cashless business is stuck in a lot of complications which require system and strictness

 Jaitley said in his budget speech, 'A plan to open AIIMS like Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal, Vidarbha in Maharashtra and Purvanchal in Uttar Pradesh is being considered
 'jetali ne narendra modi sarkaar kaa pehla aam bajet pesh karte hue kaha, 'ham chaar nae ames kii sthapana kaa prastaav rakhte hai or iske liye 500 karod rupee aavantit karne kaa prastaav he
 Four new AIIMS will be opened in Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal, Vidarbha in Maharashtra and Purvanchal in Uttar Pradesh
 'unhone kaha, 'yah santosh kaa vishay he ki jodhpur, bhopal, patna, rishikesh, bhubaneshwar or raipur main sthapit sabhi chah ames kaam karne lage hai
 He said, 'I propose a sum of 500 rupees for this
 'gauratlab he ki deshbhar main ames jaise santhaan khole jane ke prastaav ko manmohan singh kii sarkaar ne 2006 main manjuuri di thi
 It was proposed by the Bharatiya Janata Party-led government in 2003
 ames uttar bharat ke sarvshereshth sarkari aspataal ke taur par ubhara he, jisamen 1,800 bistar hai
 It treats about 9,000 people daily
 bataa den ames sabase pehle desh kii rajdhani dilli main kholaa gaya tha
 It started in the year 1956
 13 sitambar ko ek naye itihaas ko likhane kii bisaat aresas ne taiyaar kar di or bijepi usapar chalane ko taiyaar he
 That is, for the first time, the Parliamentary Board will approve the candidature of the PM on the Chief Minister of a state leaving Delhi
 pehali baar sansadeey board main baithe sabase bujurg or sabase anbhavi netaa or jansangh se bijepi tak kii kaman sambhaal chuke laalkrishna adwani ko modi ke naam par sahmati deni hogi
 Also, Murali Manohar Joshi, Venkaiah Naidu and Nitin Gadkari, who have been BJP presidents, will silently stamp Modi's name
 or loksabhaa main pratipaksh kii netaa sushamaa swaraj ko bhi gujarat ke siem ko apana leader hi nahin desh kaa leader maanate hue piem kii ummidavaari par muhar lagaani hogi
 That is, what has not happened in the BJP will be for the first time
 or bijepi kii is nai bisaat ko banane vaale sangh parivaar ke saamne kai baithko main laalkrishna kah chuke hai ki bijepi main jo ab ho rahaa he vah pehali baar ho rahaa he
 But it is important that the Sangh has also said for the first time that at present, the country is also seeing a special change and the BJP will have to make this change
 asal main modi ko lekar jo badi lakeer sangh ne khinchi he uskaa asar yah he ki dilli main abhi tak kendra kii siyasat karne vaale tamaam netaaon kaa kad chota ho gaya he
 And on the scale of popularity, everyone is in front of Modi's name
 bhishma pitamah ruthe hai?bijepi main bhishma pitamah kii tarj par maujuud laalkrishna adwani kaa kariyar kya 13 sitabanr ke baad khatm ho jaayegaa
 This is the biggest question, because Advani will have to see such a mirror as Modi for the first time since Advani continuously refused to play the role of Guru and Guide
 or isi kaaran adwani ko manaane kaa silsilaa mangalvaar shaam se hi shuru ho gaya
 Nitin Gadkari met Advani and left for Nagpur soon after the meeting
 nagpur main gadakari kii mulaakaat sarasang chaalak mohan bhagwat se honi he
 And in this episode, on September 12, BJP President Rajnath Singh will meet Advani
 or agar adwani ruthe rahe to phir mohan bhagwat kii ghanti adwani ji ke ghar par ghanghanaayegi
 And before this, the way Advani has been saying during his Nagpur tour that if he found everything as a volunteer of the Sangh, then there is no question of rebellion
 jaankaree ke mutabik 13 sitambar ko sansadeey board ke sabhi sadsy dilli main hai or rajnath singh ne sansadeey board kii baithak bulawaane kaa jimmaa or kisi ko nahin raamalaal ji ko saunpa he
 Ramlal's role is to represent the Sangh
 yani baithak rajnath singh bula jarur rahe honge lekin raamalaal jab patr lekar sansadeey board ke sadasyon ke paas jaaenge to phir inkaar koun karegaa yah apane aap main bada sawaal he
 But Rajnath Singh will formally meet Murali Manmohar Joshi and Sushma Swaraj in addition to Advani on 12 September
 yani sangh khule taur par dilli kii gaddi ke liye dilli ke netaaon se hi jis tarah ruthaa hua he usamen ek sawal yah bhi he ki agar sansadeey board kii baithak ke vakt ruthe netaa nahin pahunchate hai to kya hoga? haalaaki aisi parampara sangh ke swayamsevakon main rahi nahin he lekin samajhnaa yah bhi hoga ki mohan bhagwat ke janm ke vakt adwani sangh ke saarvajanik jivan main kadam rakh chuke the

 'the need to change West Indies cricket' The former batsman has said that whenever any positive thing comes up it is suppressed due to controversies and this is the culture of West Indies which is very important to change

 courian virdohi kheme ko yah kehane kaa mauka mil gaya ki annamma par apane bayaan ko badalane ke liye dabaav daalaa gaya
 The Congress became even more awkward when a news channel aired a telephone conversation of February 8 in which Charles Abraham was confirming the same things
 charles un teen netaaon main se ek he jinhone tiruvala main courian se mulaakaat kii thi
 In the tape, Abraham was seen boasting in a conversation with a friend that he, by tampering with the evidence, helped Kurian prove that he was not in Kumily that day

 unhone pakistan ke supreme court ke jajon kii hatya karne kii dhamkee dene or army chif qamar javed bajva ke khilaaf baghawat karne va apshabdon kaa istemaal karne par bhi chetaya
 Explain that as soon as the decision of the Pakistani Supreme Court in the Asiya Bibi case came, 'tehreek-e-labbaik Pakistan' (TLP) activists came out on the road and blocked many roads in other cities including Islamabad, Lahore, Peshawar and Karachi
 kai jagah aagjanee or suraksha balon ke saath jhadap kii bhi khabaren hai

 In addition, judges of the Supreme Court of Pakistan are being threatened with murder

 He told the protesters that the Supreme Court will not pass judgment according to you
 aise koi mulk nahin chal saktaa he
 During this, Imran Khan called the rebellion against the judges of the Supreme Court and the Army Chief as treason

 In 2010, Aasia Bibi, the mother of four children, was convicted on charges of insulting Islam during a dispute with her neighbors

 round tripping ke dwaara desh main kaala dhan waapas laayaa jaataa haniamak is maamle main koi khaas kadam nahin uthaa rahekhandhi ke inflo or outflo aankade andeh paidaa karte hambharat ke FDI par tex haven deshon kaa sayabharatiya rigerv bank (RBI) ne ek baar phir round tripping par dhyaan kendrit kiya he
 However, this focus has been limited to clarifying the current regulations regarding Overseas Direct Investment (ODI)
 gat 19 sitambar ko rigerv bank ne is bare main nayaa ‘frequently ascked queshchans’ (FAQ) jari kar yah saaf kiya ki koi bhartiya company kisi aisi videsh sthit company main hissaa nahin kharid sakati, jisane pehle se hi kisi bhartiya company main ‘automatic root’ se nivesh kiya ho
 But this statement was strongly opposed in the corporate world
 corporate jagat kaa kahana he ki iskaa vaazib nivesh par kaaphi vipareet asar padegaa, jabaki tathy yah he ki yah fund kii round tripping par ankush lagane ke liye kiya gaya tha or rigerv bank ne yah kaha tha ki agar koi aisa len-dein merit ke anusaar he to uske liye usase khaastaur se manjuuri lee ja sakati he
 What is round tripping round tripping simply means the return of a person, money, thing, etc
 to the place from which it has gone
 kaale dhan ke maamle main round tripping tab hoti he jab companiyaan vibhinn sroton se dhan kisi tex haven desh main bhejti hai or vahaan se anya strot se phir waapas apni kisi bhartiya company main nivesh kara leti hai
 With this black money is made white, tax can also be saved in both countries
 iske kai strot hote hai jaise kisi videshi fund main nivesh karnaa, global dipogitary risit (GDR) yaa participetary nots (p-notes) main nivesh karnaa or phir videsh sthit fund yaa company dwaara waapas kisi bhartiya asset main nivesh karnaa
 The round-trip of the funds was already expected to lead to protests by the corporate, as regulators and enforcement agencies such as RBI, SEBI and ED were already investigating several round tripping and other violations of ODI rules
 rigerv bank ne is saal april main aise hi ek ulanghan ko pakadaa he or aath anya maamalon kii jaanch kar rahaa he
 Two years ago, SEBI had acted on 22 companies and 17 for round tripping
 55 karod rupee kaa jurmaana lagaaya tha
 However, industry and banking sector people appear to dismiss this threat
 siaiai kii chif iconomist bidisha ganguli ne kaha ki epadiai outflo (desh se baahar jane vaali) bahut zyada nahin he or dhire-dhire yah ghat rahaa he
 Therefore, from a macroeconomic point of view, there is no need to worry too much about it
 esbiai ke group iconomic adwiser saumy kanti ghosh ne kaha ki round tripping duniya bhar main hoti he or yah jagajaahir he
 However, the matter is far ahead of what is visible with the eyes
 epadiai inflo or outflo: mila-jula khelpadai inflo (desh ke bheetar aane vaali epadiai) or epadiai outflo (desh ke kaarobaariyon dwaara baahar kiya jane vaale pratyaksh videshi nivesh) ke ek saadhaaran vishleshan se yah pataa chalata he ki kuch varshon ko chhod diya jaae (vitt varsh 2011, vitt varsh 2015 or vitt varsh 2018), to in donon kii badhat or giravat kii gati main ek samya dikhataa rahaa he

 "phantom investment" surge: IMF and Copenhagen University study released this month warns of rising "phantom investment"
 phantum investment aisa nivesh hota he, jo shell companiyon jaisi khaali corporate ikaayiyon yaa special parapaj antity main kiya jaataa he, jinamein vastav main kisi tarah kaa kaarobaar nahin hota
 These companies often undertake holding activities to reduce the global tax bill of multinational companies and hide FDI data, do intra-firm financing or manage intangible assets
 adhyayan main kaha gaya he: ‘vaishvik str par phantum nivesh ascharyajanak rup se kareeb 15 trillian dollar tak pahunch gaya he, jo china or germany jaisi aarthik takaton ke sanyukt salanaa jidipi ke baraabar he
 This is about 40 per cent of the $ 40 trillion of foreign direct investment worldwide and has increased significantly from 30 per cent a decade ago
 iske alaava study main yah paaya gaya ki phantum nivesh kaa 85 fisadi se zyada hissaa lagjamberg, netherland, honkong esar, british virgin island, bermuda, singapore, keman island, swimatoaraland, ireland or morishas jaise tex haven deshon se aayaa he
 India's FDI and OFDI tax haven countries have FDI coming into India and then a large part of FDI going out of this country is also through these tax haven countries

 Similarly, outward FDI (OFDI) is the preferred destination for overseas FDI out of India
 vitt varsh 2008 or 2015 ke liye indian institute of fahrren trade (IIFT) ke ek adhyayan or bhartiya pratyaksh nivesh companiyon ke videshi dendaree or asset par rigerv bank ke naveenatam adhyayan se yah aankade saamne aate hai
 Professor Chalapathi Rao of the Institute of Industrial Development Studies (ISID) has presented an assessment of the role of round tripping and tax haven countries
 unhone kaha ki saal 2011 ke unke adhyayan se pataa chalata he ki sitamb 2004 se disambar 2009 ke bich bharat main aae kul epadiai kaa 19
 5 per cent may be associated with round tripping
 inamen bharat se jude niveshak 10
 3 per cent, India-linked private equity 4 per cent and NRI 5

 He said that these investors thought it better to use the tax haven route than the legitimate FDI investors
 ‘anya puunji’ or ‘privet transfar’ kaa badhata pravationkatad ke saal 2003 ke ek adhyayan ke anusaar, ‘adar capital’ yani anya puunji (capital account) or ‘privet transfar’ (curent account) inflo bhi ‘ritern of flite capital’ yani round tripping ke sambhavit raste ho sakate hai
 These two have seen an uneven growth
 rigerv bank ke anusaar, ‘anya puunji’ ke aantarik pravaah main niryaat, esadiar aavanton, videsh main rakhe gaye fund, epadiai ke tahat sheyaron ke lambit masalon par hasil karj or anya sabhi puunji jiskaa kahin or ullekh na ho ‘anya puunji’ kehalaata he
 It reached $ 41 billion in FY 2018, when total FDI was up to $ 61 billion
 ‘privet transfar’ risit main paariwarik gujaarey ke liye videsh se bheji gai rakam, non resident rupi accounts se (NRE or NRO) sthaneey nikasi, paisanger bagez ke dwaara kharida gaya sona or chaandi or cheritable / dharmik sansthaaon ko diya gaya personal gift / donneton shaamil he
 There is also a significant increase in this and it has reached $ 73 billion in FY 2019, while the total FDI was up to $ 62 billion
 liberlined remitance skim (LRS) ke tahatoutflo main badhatliberlined remitance skim (LRS) yani udaarikrut preshan yojana ke tahat bhi fund kaa outflo yani bahya pravaah yaa duusare deshon ko pravaah badha he
 In 2015, the remittance limit was increased to 10 times, in 2004 it was raised to $ 25,000 annually, which was increased to $ 2,50,000 in 2015
 isse is tarah ke fund kaa outflo bhi 10 guna bad gaya, yah vitt varsh 2015 ke 1

 7 arab dollar tak pahunch gaya
 Total outward FDI (OFDI) 15 during the entire financial year
 4 arab dollar tha
 If you look at the figures in detail, a lot of money has been sent towards travel, studying abroad, family members, gifts etc
 yah bharatiyon kii sampannataa badhane kaa sanket ho saktaa he, lekin sach kya kise pataa, kyonki na jane koun-se aankade chhipaae ja rahe hon
 Neither the strategy nor the OFDI monitoring round trip by the Reserve Bank is a serious problem, but little has been studied about it
 praasangik aankadon ke vishleshan se pataa chalata he ki is bare main pehla kadam un raaston or karypranali main badlaav kii pahchaan karnaa ho saktaa he jo badale hai yaa badal rahe hai, lekin rigerv bank iske bare main ruchi kam hi dikhaa rahaa he
 Professor Rao says the Reserve Bank's attempt to curb round tripping by FDI / OFDI is grossly inadequate, as it focuses on subsidiaries of companies and ignores minority equity participation
 videshi mudra prabandhan act (FEMA) ke tahat chal rahe compounding maamalon se bhi yah sanket miltaa he ki kai choti-badi companiyaan epadiai or oefdai, donon kii reporting chhipaati hai yaa reporting main deree karti hai
 He also said that allowing automatic route in OFDI leaves little scope for investment monitoring, especially when they go to a holding company or tax haven country company

 isse pehle bharat kii ore se saiyad kirmani ne bhi 3 baar gendbaaji main haath aajamaaya tha
 Apart from this, Dhoni's name is to win all ICC Trophy as captain, make India number 1 team, get the team out of defeat and win in many matches

 On February 4, Sahara decided to withdraw from the sponsorship of Team India, breaking ties with the board
 lekin 12 din ke pashchaat samjhauta hone ke baad yah faisla hua ki sahaara bhartiya team kaa praayojak bana rahegaa
 Both the BCCI and Sahara issued a joint statement giving detailed information about the contract
 isamen pune varirs kii nilaamee ke pun:sakriy hone or trading windo ke vistaar ke alaava bhi anya chizon kaa ullekh kiya hua he
 With regard to the controversial issue of the inclusion of another player in place of Yuvraj Singh, Sahara has offered that it will obtain consent from all franchise teams to field five foreign players in IPL matches

 According to the joint statement, 'the trading window was supposed to end on February 17 but it has been extended till 29 February 2012 to provide Pune Warriors India a chance to interact with other franchise teams
 ’bayaan ke anusaar, ‘pune varirs india kii nilaamee prakriya dobaaraa jari kar di gayi he taaki vah team sangyojan niyam ke mutabik khilaadiyon ko team main shaamil kar sake
 The BCCI and Sahara have also agreed to initiate arbitration proceedings, which Sahara had initiated

 Sahara had requested for a play-off match to be played in Pune as per schedule and the BCCI said that it agreed in principle to hold it in the new stadium in Pune provided it was agreed to by Royal Challengers Bangalore

 bayaan ke anusaar, ‘sahaara ne pushti kii ki vah bhartiya team kaa praayojak bana rahegaa
 As per the agreement, Sahara would like to continue the right to sponsor
 ’ sahaara pichley 11 saal se bhartiya team kaa praayojak rahaa he or chaar farvari ko usne yah shikaayat karte hue bisisiai se hatane kaa faisla kiya tha ki uski khilaadiyon or maichon kii sankhya se sambandhit shikayaton par gaur nahin kiya gaya
 If the BCCI could not reach this agreement, it could have incurred a loss of Rs 2000 crore

 Alexander of political battle
 
 And the common man's emperor in the country's capital
 
 
 yahi he arvind kejariwal kii kamyaabi kii kahani
 
 2013 main dilli or centre sarkaar se morcha lene vaale kejariwal ab khud sarkaar banakar baithe hai
 Kejriwal has succeeded, but the success of the common man is far away
 ek maheene main aam aadmi party ke netaa kejariwal ne to bahut kuch hasil kar liya, lekin aam aadmi ko kya mila? aam aadmi jo kejariwal kii party kii asli takat he, uske hisse main kya aayaa
 
 ? pichley ek maheene ne dilli main aam aadmi party kii surat or sirat donon hi badali di, lekin dilli kii takadir main badlaav aana abhi baaki he
 
 lakhon dilli waalon ke saamne mukhyamantri banane se pehle or siem kaa taj sanbhaalane ke baad jo vaade kiye the use aam aadmi nahin bhuulaa he
 First of all, the day Kejriwal tried to differentiate himself from the Chief Minister till now
 shapath grahan kaa din
 Kejriwal, a special leader of the common man, went by metro to take oath of CM
 ye ek aitihaasik lamhaa tha
 Arvind Kejriwal came to metro from Kaushambi like a very common man
 lekin, is baat kii itani charchaa hui ki mukhyamantri ko dekhne ke liye metro ke andar or baahar sadakon par behisaab bheed aa gai
 That is, Kejriwal came from the metro like a common man, but his journey became a problem for the common man coming to the metro every day
 kejariwal jab ramlila maidan pahunche to hajaaron aam aadmi ne unka swaagat kiya
 Because for the first time new history was being written in Ramlila Maidan
 lekin itihaas badalane ke is andaaj ne shapathgrahan samaaroh kaa bajet bahut badha diya
 This celebration was very expensive for the common man
 mukhyamantri kii shapath lete hi kejariwal ne sabase pehle rajanetaaon ko aam aadmi banane kaa elaan kiya
 He showed the use of red lights for his entire cabinet a red signal
 mantriyon ne lalabatti to thukraa di, lekin puri tarah viipi culture se dur nahin rah sake
 The carts of VIP numbers bear witness to this
 iske alaava jo mantri pehle do din auto or metro se vidhansabha pahunche wo tisare hi din se gadiyon main aane lage
 There were controversies regarding this
 lekin aam aadmi ko kuch hasil nahin hua
 
 kejariwal sarkaar ne dilli kii janata ke saamne ek or bada elaan kiya
 Pledged to keep himself and his ministers away from big bungalows
 lekin aam aadmi or dilli sarkaar ke rahanuma khud 10 kamaron vaale bangale main grih pravesh kii taiyaari karne lage
 When there was a dispute over the Chief Minister's big bungalow, he realized that he was a common man
 or aam aadmi to das kamaron vaale ghar kaa sapana bhi nahin dekh saktaa
 The Chief Minister had given another message to the public
 ki wo netaaon jaisi baari-bharkam suraksha nahin lenge
 The government's argument was that the policemen should be deployed for the safety of the public and not to be with the leaders
 lekin kejariwal ke ghar par upi police kii jed security he or sachivalay main bhi baari suraksha gheraa rahata he
 Kejriwal has got police protection from two states
 lekin, aam aadmi ko kya mila
 
 ?mukhyamantri metro se shapath lene pahunche
 
 
 The common man played applause but his hands remained empty
 
 The ministers left the red light
 
 The public still did not get anything
 
 The Chief Minister refused to take a big house
 
 But what did the common man get
 
 The In the 30 days, the government went on announcing several successions, but the wrinkle of the common man's forehead did not reduce
 
 Promises have neither been able to find their way nor have they found the floor

 Let's say that Ranveer married Bollywood actress Deepika Padukone on 14 November in Lake Como, Italy
 is shahi main bahut gine-chune log hi shariq hue the
 Only a few close friends and guests arrived at the wedding
 iske baad ranvir-deepika ne pehla resepshan bengaluru main diya or doosraa mumbai main

 shaayad isi vajah semayawatike dulaare naukarshahon ne satta parivartan kii aahat sun lee
 In the first week of January, six bureaucrats had applied for deputation to the Center
 unhen ashanka thi ki satta parivartan ke baad unhen panishment posting par niyukt kiya ja saktaa he
 Such deputation is usually for five years
 samaajawaadee party (sapa) sarkaar banane ke baad in afasaron main se kai ko nai dilli main tainaati kii hari jhandi mil gai he
 On the other hand, during Mayawati's rule, bureaucrats posted in non-important posts are increasing their proximity to SP leaders in the desire to get better posts
 mayawati ke kareebi naukarshahon kii ashanka 15 march ko sahi sabit ho gai
 Akhilesh Yadav took over as Chief Minister, all the principal secretaries posted in the Chief Minister's Office - Kunwar Fateh Bahadur, Ravindra Singh, Netram, R
 pi
 Singh and Durgashankar Mishra and all secretaries Navneet Sehgal, Anil Sant and Chandrabhanu were removed from their posts
 in sabhi adhikariyon ko nai tainaati na dekar pratiksharat rakhaa gaya he
 The Mayawati government had one cabinet secretary, five principal secretaries and three secretaries
 bahujan samaaj party (basapa) kii haar ke baad sabase pehle cabinet sachiv shashaank shekhar singh ne istipha diya
 When Mayawati got an absolute majority in 2007, she relied more on bureaucracy than her party colleagues and gave the reins of power to the same bureaucrats
 pehali baar rajya kii naukarshahi ke upar cabinet sachiv kaa pad srujit hua or us par shashaank shekhar ko bithaaya gaya jo na to bhartiya prashasnic seva (iees) ke adhikari the or na hi prantiy prashasnic seva (pisies) ke, balki mahaj ek pilot the
 But ironically, during her five-year reign, Mayawati did not sit in her office two dozen times for the Chief Minister on the fifth floor of the Secretariat (annexe) and from where the state functions
 pancham tal (aam bolchaal kii bhashaa main sachivalay sthit mukhyamantri karyaalay) par virajman shashaank ne ek tarah se 'dephacto' mukhyamantri bataur kaam kiya
 State ministers used to sit in queues to meet the cabinet secretary
 mayawati shashaank ko rajyasabha main bhejnaa chaahati thim lekin party sadasyon or vidhayakon ke virodh ke chalate unhen apane kadam peeche khinchne pade
 Some senior members said that bureaucrats' autocracy is responsible for the defeat of the BSP
 shashaank ke liye rajyasabha kaa rasta bhale hi roak liya gaya ho lekin mayawati sarkaar ne cabinet bai cirkulation ke jariye cabinet sachiv ke liye sarkari naukari se hatane ke baad bhi ek chaparasi or driver kaa intjaam kar diya he
 The Home Department was also responsible for the transfer and posting of officers from all over the state under the charge of Dalit class IAS officer Kunwar Fateh Bahadur as Principal Secretary
 1979 batch ke iees netaram ko mukhyamantri sachivalay main sachiv jaise mahatvapurn pad par tainaat kiya gaya tha
 As the principal secretary of the Excise, Sugarcane and Sugar Industries Department, he faced many allegations
 baad main netaram ko ukt vibhaagon ke pramukh sachiv ke dayitvon sahit mukhyamantri kaa bhi pramukh sachiv banaakar pancham tal par baitha diya gaya
 He can be sent to an insignificant post in SP government
 pancham tal par tainaat rahe afasaron main 1984 batch ke iees adhikari durga shankar mishra cabinet sachiv shashaank shekhar kii khaas pasand the
 Mishra was made the principal secretary to the Chief Minister as a Brahmin face
 iske saath hi unhen naagarik uddyan, kar evam nibandhan or baad main nagar vikaas vibhaag ke pramukh sachiv kaa atirikt kaarybhaar bhi diya gaya
 The 1983 IAS officer R
, who was posted as the Chief Secretary to the Chief Minister on the fifth floor itself
 pi
 Singh has also obtained the No Objection Certificate required for deployment on deputation to the Central Government
 pramukh sachivon ke alaava pancham tal par tainaat sachiv str ke adhikariyon main sabase lokapriy or mayawati ke kareebi iees adhikari navaneet sahagal kaa bhavishya tay nahin he
 Sehgal, a 1988 batch IAS officer who returned from deputation in Delhi at the time of Mayawati's swearing in 2007, was serving as additional secretary of the Chief Minister as well as urban development, state property and energy departments
 satta ke galiyaaron main charchaa he ki sahagal ne sapa ke varisht netaaon ke jariye mulaayam singh yadav se sampark saadhaa he
 During Mayawati's government in 2007, 1988 batch Dalit IAS officer Anil Sant was posted at the center
 basapa pramukh se najdiki kii vajah se unhen centre se bulaakar mukhyamantri ke sachiv pad par tainaati di gai
 Later, Sant was also given the charge of Additional Housing Commissioner and Secretary of Basic Education Department, but seeing the scope of coordination in the new government in the state, the saint has made up his mind to go back on deputation to the center and for this he also has the necessary clearance
 Has been found
 sant kii tarah ek anya dalit iees adhikari chandrabhanu bhi centre main tainaati ke liye jaruri karrwai puri kar chuke hai
 Not only the officer posted on the fifth floor, but some other officers close to Mayawati have also completed the formalities required for deployment at the center
 inamen krishi vibhaag ke sachiv susheel kumaar, vigyaan evam praudyogiki sachiv mohammad mustafa or paryaavaran sachiv rajesh kumaar singh shaamil hai
 SP spokesperson Rajendra Chaudhary, in view of Mayawati's desire to deploy outside the state's favorite officers, says, "the SP government will not act with political hatred against any officer
" haa, itnaa jarur he ki mayawati sarkaar main bhrashtachar failaane vaale adhikariyon par karrwai hogi
 "if Mayawati's favorite officers are looking for other destinations for themselves, then the favorite officers of Mulayam Singh, who are marginalized in the BSP government, are also looking for a good posting for themselves in the SP government
 centre sarkaar main pratiniyukti par tainaat varisht iees adhikari anil kumaar gupta pradesh main waapas laut aae hai
 IAS officers Shailesh Krishna, Kumar Arvind Singh Dev, Anita Singh, Nitin Gokarn, Neeraj Gupta, Sanjay Bhatia, Anurag Yadav, Santosh Yadav, Shambhu Singh Yadav and Pranjal Yadav can be posted in important departments
 pradesh ke afasaron main janata kii bajaae rajanetaaon ke prati nishthavan dikhne kii badhati pravriti ko lakhanu vishvavidhyalay main raajnneeti shaastra vibhaag main professor dow
 Ramesh Dixit considers it quite fatal for democracy
 ve kehete hai, ''sakasham or yogya adhikariyon ko mahatvapurn padon par tainaati dene kii bajaae sarkaar apane munh lage afasaron ko praathamikta detii he taaki unase manamafik kaam karaayaa ja sake
 In the desire to get a good posting, officers also try to be the most reliable of politicians
 issen janata kii seva kaa paksh kamjor or adhikariyon kii mahatvakankshaayen prabhavi ho jaati hai
 However, while the aspirations of a section of the bureaucrats in the state have woken up, trouble has begun for bureaucrats close to Mayawati, who were even more influential than the public representatives under the BSP
