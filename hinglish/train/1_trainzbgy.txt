 isi kadi main shuukravaar ko susheel modi ne lalu ke bade bete or swasthya mantri tejpratap se judaa ek bada khulaasa kiya
 Questioning Tej Pratap's income, Sushil Modi alleged how Tej Pratap, at the age of 20, bought 20,000 square feet of land in his name in Aurangabad district of Bihar and for that time he paid Rs 53 lakh as well
 According to Modi, after purchasing the land, Tej Pratap took a loan of two crores and 29 lakh rupees from the bank, against the pledge of this land
 modi kaa aarope he ki tej pratap ne chunavi halafname main naa to is jameen kharid kaa zikr kiya he or naa hi bank se lone lene kii baat kahi he
 Know and what accusations Sushil Modi made - Where did the 53 lakh rupees come from Tej Pratap to buy 2 xxrep 4 0 sq ft land in Aurangabad? - In 2010, on this very land of Aurangabad, the Lalu family named Lara Distribution Private Limited Company opened
 is company main lalu kii teen betiyaan misa bharti, chanda or raagini ke alaava lalu kii patni rabari devi bhi nideshak bani

 - Tej Pratap neither mentioned this land in the election affidavit nor said this land in the information of his property submitted to Chief Minister Nitish Kumar
 - 2 karod 29 lakh rupye lone kaa zikr bhi chunavi halafname main nahin he
 - This land was purchased not in the name of Lara Distribution Private Limited but in the personal name of Tej Pratap
 - nitish kumaar ko is maamle kaa sangyaan lete hue tej pratap ko mantrimandal se barkhaast kar dena chahie
 - i will soon complain to the Election Commission on the issue of hiding information in the election affidavit by Tej Pratap

 The Union Ministry of Environment has flouted the statement by BJP MP and Parliamentary Panel Chief DK Gandhi, in which he said that no survey linking cancer and cigarettes has been conducted in the country and what is known about this cancer Happens or not? aaj paryaavaran mantri prakaash jaavdekar ne patrakaron se kaha ki vah dike gandhi se sahamat nahin he, kyonki vigyaan galat nahin ho saktaa
 Importantly, the parliamentary panel for cigarettes and other tobacco products has argued against the enlargement of the pictorial warning on cigarette packets from April 1 that doing so would create panic among people, as well as employment
 Will also be affected
 abhi tak yah chetavanee packet ke 40 fisadi hisse main hoti thi, jise badhaakar 85 fisadi kiya janaa tha
 At the same time, NCP MP Supriya Sule is surprised by the statement of DK Gandhi
 unka kahana he ki aaraar patil kii maut tambaakoo ke kaaran hi hui thi
 If you want to see any evidence, once you go to Tata Memorial Hospital, the situation will be known
 ullekhneey he ki pichley hi saal tambaakoo companiyon ko nirdesh jari kiye gaye the ki 1 april, 2015 se cigarette ke dibbe ke 85 fisadi bhaag par swasthya sambandhi chetavanee di jaae
 However, the parliamentary committee has stated the need for further discussion in this matter, due to which the relief for the tobacco companies is seen

 It is up to the government whether or not to accept the recommendations of the parliamentary committee, but according to social workers campaigning against smoking, not implementing the warning as per deadline is not a good sign
 pichley saal november main jab bharat sarkaar ne cigarette kharidne kii nunatam umr badhaakar 25 saal karne or khuli cigarette bechney par roak lagane kii baat kahi thi, to swasthya kshetra se jude tamaam logon ne is faisle kaa swaagat kiya tha
 The scheme was put up in Parliament by Health Minister JP Nadda, but the government has not been able to proceed on it

 The Reserve Bank will sell these dollars back to these banks in 2022
 is kadam se bank na keval apad sthiti ke liye surakshit rakhe dollaron ko prachlit mudra main badal sakenge, balki isse sarkari bond kaa labharjan bhi kam hoga or companiyon ke liye bahari vanijyik udhaaron ke madhyam se sansaadhan jutanaa aasaan hoga
 The move could result in further reductions in the rbi's interest rates, with inflation forecast to be low after a 25 basis point cut in February

 bharat main jitani jaldi or jitani kushalta se international court of justise main jaakar kulbhushan ke faansee par ste hasil kar liya he usase pakistan hairaan he
 In Delhi, the Foreign Ministry spokesman Gopal Bagle said that the decision to go to the International Court of Justice was taken very consciously by the Government of India when Pakistan was consistently rejecting India's proposal to grant counselor access
 bharat ab tak 16 baar counslar acces ke liye pakistan sarkaar se anurodh kar chukaa he
 Gopal Bagle said that Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj had written a letter to Sartaj Aziz himself on 27 April to give a visa to the family to meet the family of Kikulbhushan Jadhav
 lekin iske baavjood unke parivaar ko vija nahin di gai
 Gopal Bagle told Kikulbhushan Jadhav where he is and how he is still, nothing is known about it
 kyonki baar-baar kehane ke baavjood pakistan is bare main koi jaankaree nahin de rahaa he
 India has taken a case to the International Court of Justice for the first time after nearly 45 years

 To save them, the government took this step very thoughtfully

 In response to a question, Foreign Ministry spokesman Gopal Bagle said that the Government of India has not stopped giving visas to those coming to India for treatment from Pakistan
 lekin soshal media par ilaaj ke liye vija dene ke anurodh ko maananaa mushkil he
 He said that if people wishing to come to India for treatment, send applications along with the letter of Sartaj Azizki, India will not delay in granting visas to such people

 Once there was a fierce fight between day and night
 din ne kaha, main ujaalaa hum
 The night said that the elder came to spread the light, oh i am not, so you can never come
 jhagada itnaa badha kii raat ne kaha aaj se raat khatm
 What was it to be sansar main koharaam much gaya
 People were fed up with light
 jo log kabhi khidki daravaaje kholkar din ke ujaale kaa intjaar karte the, ve mot-mot kambal khidakiyon par daalane lage or khidkiyaan band karwaane lage
 Then Narada reached there and gave the same knowledge that you will get after reading this story
 to padhiepatni / premika uwach-sara din main ghar par kaam karti hum
 You get a holiday at least in the week, but here i keep on rounding it round the clock
 
 
 pati / premi uwach-bos kii daant suno to pataa chale, daftar kaa boj kya hota he tum kya jaanon
 
 
 The sparring of husband and wife, competing to undermine each other's work
 
 
 agar donon kaamkaaji hon to bhi isi tarah vivaad badhate-badhate brallep tak aaj jaataa he
 
 
 And to tell the truth, no matter how glamorous Bollywood glamorises it, but even today breakups from Saiyan Ji or Sajni ji still make the hearts of lovers / girlfriends or husband and wife cry in broad roar
 or phir vivaad-uff
 
 
 How delicious 
 
 or yahi chik-chik ek din ban jaati he bada jhagada
 Kalpati / lover to reverse and reverse - On the whole day you keep working at home
 mujhe kam se kam hafte main ek chuttee to mil jaati he, par yahaan tum choubison ghante-saaton din khatati rahati hum
 
 
 Wife / Girlfriend - You bear all the tension in the office
 main to ghar main apane parivaar ke saath rahati hum
 You move around all day carrying workload
 kam se kam ghar kii tension to main kam hi kar sakati hum
 Research reports have also reached these results
 
 
 ki ek duusare kii kamiyaan ginaakar unhen ulaahna dene se baat bigadati he
 
 
 In a recent report published in SEZ Publication, this matter has been recorded with seriousness
 netherland or canada main romantic jodon ke bich ek manovaigyanik shodh kiya gaya
 Such questions were prepared for this research, in which the two partners were asked about doing gratitude shows about each other
 unase poocha gaya ki vah kitni baar ek duusare ke bare main gratitude sho karte hai? kya ek duusare balidaan ko samajhate hai? kitni baar unhone ek duusare tyaag ko khud ke tyaag se zyada mahatv diya?yakeen maniye pati-patni, premi-premika se mili sawaalon se saaf ho gaya ki sajani or sajnaa ke bich jhagade kii vajah ek duusare ke tyaag ko tavajjo na dena he
 
 
 
 
 According to experts, there is nothing to do
 
 
 aap jo kar rahe hai use karte rahiye
 Just the sharp tongue has to be stopped from whipping between relations
 to deree kis baat kii shuru kiijie aaj se sakaaratmak samvaad
 
 
 
 or khwamakhwaah kii chik-chik ko dur bhagaaiye
 
 
 Because many times we become ostrich while watching other's work
 jaise vah apni gardan baaluu main dhansaae rahata he
 We also stop our brain by calling ourselves great

 jisamen daawa kiya gaya he ki rashtriya rajdhani ke sabhi police steshnon main sisitivi camere nahin hai
 After which the Delhi High Court has sought their response from the Center and Delhi Government in this regard
 nyaayadhish es ravindra bhatta or sunil gaur kii ek peeth ne dilli police ko notice jari kiya he or yachika par uskaa paksh jaananaa chaha he
 The petition has claimed that even though some police stations have cameras installed, they are of no use due to lack of recording features

 Amid the chaos caused by the leadership change process in the BJP, the party on Sunday clarified that party president Rajnath Singh will not get a second term as the party legislation does not allow it
 party ne vipaksh ke netaa laalkrishna adwani ke raajnneeti se avkaash lene kii atakalon ko bhi khaarij kiya
 On the possibility of a second term for Singh, party spokesperson Prakash Javadekar said directly, "no, we are given only one term, so there should be no doubt about it
" har teen saal baad nae adhyaksh ko chunane ke liye chunaav hota he
 Rajnath's term ends in December this year
 party vidhaan ke anusaar adhyaksh teen saal ke liye chunaa jaataa he or vah lagaataar duusare kaarykaal ke liye nirvaachit nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 Sources said that the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh has ruled out the possibility of the appointment of Arun Jaitley, m Venkaiah Naidu, Sushma Swaraj and Ananth Kumar as the next president
 sangh kisi aise vyakti ko is pad par asin karne ke paksh main he jo rajnath yaa adwani kheme ke vyakti ke rup main nahin dekha jaataa ho
 On the other hand, senior leader m Venkaiah Naidu termed the opposition leader LK Advani's withdrawal from politics as completely baseless
 unhone haidarabad main kaha, ‘‘main aapako vishwaas dilaataa hum ki adwani ke avkaash lene yaa unako kone main dhakelne kii media kii atakalein niraadhaar hai
 Who can push Advani in the corner
 kismen aisi kshamta he?’’ Rahul Gandhi is going to command the 130-year-old Indian National Congress
 unhone somvaar ko congress adhyaksh pad ke liye namakan daakhil kiya or koi pratispardhi na hone kii vajah se 11 disambar ko nae party adhyaksh ke rup main unka naam ghoshit hona tay he
 As the Congress President, Rahul Gandhi will face seven major challenges
 aaie jaanate hai ki kya hongi ye saat chunautiyaan
 
 
 1
 nehru-gandhi parivaar kii chaaya se baahar nikalnaarahul gandhi ko nehru-gandhi parivaar kaa thappa viraasat main mila he
 But this will not be enough to woo young voters
 yuva bharat kii aakankshaayen kaaphi badal gai hai or un tak pahunch banane ke liye rahul gandhi ko nehru-indira gandhi kii chaaya se baahar nikalnaa hoga
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has the ability to connect directly with voters, Rahul will also have to find his way to reach people directly
 2
 Strengthening Congress: The biggest challenge before Rahul Gandhi is to strengthen the Congress, which has been defeated in successive states after heavy defeats in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 rahul aise samay main congress kii kaman sanbhaalane ja rahe hai, jab uski sirf chah rajyon main sarkarein hai
 As president, the biggest task for Rahul Gandhi will be to bring new energy to the party and the workers
 3
 With the new vision, the party's leadership is discussing the current social media incarnation of Gandhi
 unhone gujarat chunaav ke apane bhaashanon main aam bolchaal kii bhashaa kaa istemaal kiya he, jisaki vajah se vah puure desh ke logon se jud paae hai
 The way Rahul Gandhi has changed his style during the election season, in the same way he will have to change the party with a new vision and fresh attitude
 4
 Dealing with the Modi wave As the Congress President, Rahul will now have to face Narendra Modi directly
 bhartiya janata party modi ke naam par puure desh main lagaataar kai chunaav jiti he
 The Modi wave has been such that it has snatched away its traditional strongholds like Assam from the Congress
 rahul ke liye is modi lahar se nipatna ek badi chunauti hogi
 5
 majboot vipaksh taiyaar karnachunaavon main bijepi ke behtareen pradarshan kii ek vajah yah bhi he ki mukhya vipaksh ke rup main sansad ke andar or baahar congress kaa pradarshan bahut feekaa rahaa he
 The Congress will have to use every opportunity, issue and platform from public meetings to Parliament to attack the Modi government
 rahul gandhi ko bijepi sarkaar ke khilaaf ek majboot vipaksh ke rup main netritv karnaa hoga
 6
 yuvaaon or varishton ke bich santulan bananarahul ke saamne ek or chunauti hogi congress main yuva or varisht netaaon ke bich santulan bananaa
 In many state units of the Congress, there is a power struggle between young Congressmen and seniors
 rajasthan main sachin payalat banaam ashok gahalot, madhya pradesh main jyotiraditya sindhiya banamdigvijay sinhaur dilli main ajay maakan banaam shila dikshit aise kuch udhaaharan he
 7
 bade rajyon main vidhansabha chunaav jeetnacongress adhyaksh ke rup main aage gujarat or himachal pradesh chunaav main jeet yaa haar kii rahul gandhi ko jimmedaari leni hogi
 There are elections in big states like Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Karnataka next year before Lok Sabha elections in 2019
 in rajyon main congress kaa pradarshan yah tay karegaa ki narendra modi ko chunauti dene ke maamle main rahul gandhi kaa bhavishya kya hoga

 There is no doubt in how precious the relationship between a child and his father is
 par kya aapako maaloom he ki pita apane bacchon ke saath kitna or kaisaa vakt bitaate hai, is baat kaa asar bachche ki budhimata par bhi padataa he? iskaa matlab ye he ki ab ek pita ke liye apane bachche ke saath vakt bitaana ferj hi nahin jarurat bhi he
 Time needs to be spent Recently, a study conducted at Imperial College of London has revealed that if a father spends a good time with his children from an early age, there is a positive impact on children's intelligence
 adhyayan main ye bhi pataa chalaa ki shant, samvedansheel or kam chintaa karne vaale swabhaav ke logon ke bachche budhimaan‘yangsters’banate hai
 The father's interaction with the child right from childhood enhances the child's abilities
 kya kehete hai shodhakartimperial college of landan ke professor paul ramchandani ne bataaya ki, is adhyayan se ye baat saaf he ki ek pita ko apane bachche ke saath ghulana-milanaa chahie or ek acha vakt guzaarana chahie, phir wo chaahe kitna hi chota kyon na ho
 Researchers at Imperial College conducted a research on 128 fathers and children
 is shodh ke dauraan unhone 3 maheene tak ke bacchon ke unke pita ke saath khelte vakt ke video banaaye or iske 2 saal ke baad bachche ke ‘mental development index’ kaa test liya, jaise ki rangon yaa aakaaron ko pahchaanana
 Research found more intelligent and intelligent children, whose father has been playing or spending time with them since childhood
 king college landan kii shodhakarta vaheshta sethna ne bataaya ki ‘is shodh se hamane ye janaa ki ‘reeding activity’ or pita kaa apane bachche ke saath rahanaa bachche par kitna sakaaratmak asar daal saktaa he
 So if you want your child to be intelligent and intelligent then start spending a good time with him

 Delhi Chief Minister and Aam Aadmi Party convenor Arvind Kejriwal is upset with the mlas of his own party
 kejariwal ke lagaataar kehane ke baavjood bhi AAP vidhayak janata se mulaakaat nahin kar rahe hai
 The Aam Aadmi Party feels that the party's image is continuously deteriorating due to the legislators not going public
 kai shikaayatein milane ke baad brihaspativaar coarvind kejarivalane apane sabhi vidhayakon ko chitthee likhakar poocha he ki ve agle do maheenon ke dauraan kab, kahaan or kitni baar daura karenge? is babat kejariwal ne apane sabhi vidhayakon se ravivaar tak jaankaree uplabdh karaane ko bhi kaha he
 He took this drastic step when he was constantly receiving complaints from the party workers and other sources about the absence of mlas
 kejariwal ne apane sabhi vidhayakon ko likhi chitthee main kaha he, 'pichhalividhayak dal kii baithkmein hamane tay kiya tha ki sabhi vidhayak rose subah janata se milane ke liye apane daftar main maujuud rahenge
 All except a few mlas have started following it
 main ummid karata hum ki baaki vidhayak bhi ise jald shuru kar denge
 'kejriwal has further written that people in some areas complain that their mlas never come to meet them
 aap sarkaar ke kaam kii chaaron taraf saraahna ho rahi he, lekin janata us vidhayak se bhi milanaa chaahati he, jise usne vot dekar jitayaa tha
 It is clear from this letter of Kejriwal that there is a distance between the MLA and the public of the party, which is being borne by the party
 party ke bade netaaon ke baar-baar kehane ke baavjood vidhayak janata se nahin jud paa rahe
 After the corporation elections, Arvind Kejriwal called a meeting of the legislature party, in which it was decided that every MLA would visit the people in his constituency at least every Saturday and Sunday
 kejariwal ne vidhayakon se kaha ki vidhayak dal main liya gaya nirnay abhi puri tarah lagu nahin hua he or meraa har vidhayak se anurodh he ki ve kis din apane vidhansabha ke kis kshetra main jaaenge, iskaa ek plan taiyaar karen
 Troubled with the legislators, Kejriwal has asked every MLA to make a plan to visit every small colony of his assembly in 2 months and send it by this Sunday

 singh ne kaha ki is ahm vidheyak kaa swaroop tay karne kaa kaam samaaj ke chuninda logon ke bharose nahin choda ja saktaa
 Digvijay told reporters at Indore Press Club, 'I am in favor of Lokpal Bill
 lekin is vidheyak kaa masauda taiyaar karne kii jimmedaari samaaj ke chuninda logon ko nahin saunpi ja sakati or aisi koi sanstha nahin banaayi ja sakati jo uskaa durupyog kar sake
 He said that why only a select number of civil society were kept in the committee drafting the proposed Lokpal Bill of the government
 ‘kya rajaneta asabhy hai, jo ve samaaj ke sadsy nahin ho sakate
 The Congress General Secretary said, "I would even suggest that the committee drafting the Lokpal Bill should summon the representatives of all political parties and discuss them
" charchaa is baat par bhi honi chaiye ki is vidheyak ke daayre main copererat kshetra or gaiyr sarkari sanghathanon ko shaamil kiya jaye yaa nahin
 Digvijay Singh said on a question, 'if in the name of society, Anna Hazare and his companions say that their words are the line of God, then it is not acceptable to us
 ’digvijay ne kaha ki yah sambhav nahin he ki lokapal vidheyak par naagarik samaaj ke taiyaar masaude ko puri tarah maan liya jaye, ‘samvidhan ke antargat chune gayi jan pratinidhiyon kaa adhikaar koi kaise chin saktaa he
 He described Hazare, a social worker who waged a war against corruption, as a 'good man', but said that some people surrounded him and 'used' him
 kya alag-alag dalon ke siyaasi netaa isaliye hajaare ke khilaaf sur main sur mila rahe hai ki ve unase bhaybheet hai, is sawaal par digvijay ne kaha, ‘bilkul nahin
 i still touch Hazare's feet with respect and will touch you tomorrow
 lekin ham unki yah baat nahin maan sakate ki saare rajaneta or matadaata beyimaan hai
 Digvijay also said that he respects Shanti Bhushan and Prashant Bhushan as good lawyers
 ‘lekin acchhee vakaalat karnaa or kisi vidheyak kaa acha masauda taiyaar karnaa do alag-alag baaten hai
 He said that if corruption is to be eradicated, then Lokpal Bill alone will do nothing
 is silsile main buniyaadon baton par dhyaan dena hoga, jisamen ghoshit aay se zyada sampatti rakhane ke maamalon par prabhavi ankush lagaana shaamil he

 pakistan cricket board kii akjicutive cameti ke chairman najam sethi ne saaf kiya he ki match jeetne par cricketrs ko kaise jashn manaanaa he ye unheen par nirbhar karata he
 According to Sethi, there is no ban on Pakistani cricketers for doing push-ups after winning the match
 haalanki sethi kaa ye bayaan unke us kathith rukh ke ulat hai jo unhone sports ke liye sansadeey cameti ke samaksh dikhaaya tha
 According to media reports, Sethi had given the assurance
 maidan par match jeetne ke baad khilaadiyon kaa maidan par push-aps karnaa sirf england daure tak simit tha or bhavishya main aisa kabhi nahin hoga
 'no ban on push-ups' a few hours after the meeting, Sethi spoke in several tweets
 sethi ne kaha- khuda ke vaaste, push-aps par koi bain nahin he
 i believe that whenever players hit a century, put 100 push-ups
 sethi ne ek or twit main kaha ki sajadaa karnaa he yaa push-aps, ye khilaadiyon par chhod dena chahie
 The PCB openly praises the fitness training facilities of the Pakistani Army
 is suvidha kaa 6 saal main teen baar istemaal kiya gaya
 'pakistan cricket should avoid politicization' In another tweet, Sethi said that the media should avoid politicizing the Pakistan cricket team
 isse pehle din main pakistani media kii ore se khabar ai thi ki pakistan cricket team ke match jeetne ke baad iske sadasyon kii ore se maidan par push-aps karne par roak laga di gai he
 Let me tell you that Rana Afzal Khan, MP of the ruling party Pakistan Muslim League (nawaz) in the parliamentary committee, objected to the push-ups in the field on behalf of the players
 unka kahana tha ki is tarah kii harakat se desh kii galat chhavi duniya ke saamne jaati he
 According to the 'the Express Tribune' report, 'gentleman game does not match push-ups', Rana suggested that players should dress instead of push-ups
 rana ne kaha ki cricket jantalman game he, jisase push-aps karnaa mail nahin khaataa
 Pakistan Cricket Board official Najam Sethi had assured Rana and other members of the committee that Pakistani cricketers would no longer celebrate the victory in push-ups
 najam sethi ke mutabik aisa sirf england ke pichley daure par hua tha
 'pakistan team participated in army training camp' Pakistan cricket team participated in training camp organized by Pakistan Army before tour of England
 usee ke baad pakistani cricketrs jeet kaa jashn push-aps ke saath manaane lage
 Firstly, in the Lord's Test against England in July, captain misbah-ul-haq did push-ups after hitting a century
 lards test jeetne ke baad puri pakistani team ne push-aps kiye the
 Pakistani players said that this was their way of fitness thanking the army

 yahaan samvaadadaataaon ke ek sawaal ke jawaab main up mukhyamantri payalat ne kaha, ''sonia gandhi (sonia Gandhi)jab (adhyaksh) baniin to antarim adhyaksh bani thim ye sabhi jaanate hai

 After this it is decided that the election of Rajya Sabha candidates from UP will now be held on June 11 through voting

 Let us tell you that Preeti Mahapatra is from Gujarat
 unke pati arbapati bijnesaman hai
 According to the information, BJP has fielded him here

 During this, he said that i have nothing to do with any party

 BJP is taking all possible steps to win the political battle of Amethi and Rae Bareli Lok Sabha seats
 amethi main bijepi pratyaashee smriti irani or raibareli main bijepi ke dinesh pratap singh ke paksh main party netaaon ke saath-saath sahyogi dal ke netaa bhi chunaav prachaar kar rahe hai
 In amethi-rae Bareli seat, the voters of the Pasi community are in the role of kingmaker, who is considered a traditional voter of Congress
 aise main bijepi ne in donon siton par paasi samudaay ko saadhane ke liye bijepi ke sahyogi lok janashakti party ke adhyaksh ram vilaas paswan kaa turup ke pattey ke taur par istemaal kiya he
 Now it has to be seen that Paswan's efforts will be able to feed lotus in the fort of the Congress? Smriti Irani is contesting from BJP against Congress President Rahul Gandhi in Amethi
 bijepi ne rahul ke khilaaf jabardast gheraabandi kar rakhaa he
 In this episode, BJP President Amit Shah asked Ram Vilas Paswan to reach Amethi and Rae Bareli and campaign there for bjp's Smriti Irani and Dinesh Singh
 iske baad 28 april ko paswan ne amethi sansadeey kshetra ke paasi bahul ilaake parasadepur ke rahimganj chauraahey par jansabha ko sambodhit karte hue gandhi parivor ko dalit virdohi bataaya
 Paswan said that Modi has done as much work for the upliftment of Dalits
 utana kaam kisi bhi sarkaar ne nahin kiya he
 He said that Modi has given Dr
 ambedkar ko sammaan diya he
 Created the SCST Act and those people say that Modi is anti-dalit
 unako kya pataa ki koun kiskaa virodh kar rahaa he
 We are all together, everyone is progressing in development
 modi ne dalit ko raashtrapati banaaya, ye aaj tak kisi ne nahin kiya, uske baad bhi kehete hai ki modi dalit virdohi hai
 After Paswan Amethi was to address a public meeting in favor of BJP candidate Dinesh Pratap Singh at Baburiha Maidan in Maharajganj town of Rae Bareli parliamentary seat
 paswan yahaan jansabha ko sambodhit kiye bagaiyr hi lakhanu kii ore chale gaye
 BJP leaders argued on this that Singal could not be found to land the helicopter, due to which the landing could not take place
 or paswan jansabha ko sambodhit nahin kar sake
 On the other hand, opposition parties say that there was no crowd in the public meeting, which Paswan had seen from above
 ise chalate unhone apane helicopter kii landing nahin karaayi
 In fact, Amethi and Rae Bareli are in the role of kingmakers of the Pasi community on the parliamentary seat
 in donon seat par haar-jeet tay karne main paasi samudaay ke matadaataaon kii ahm bhoomika rahati he
 Since Independence, the Lok Sabha of the Pasi community in these two seats vote for the Congress in the Lok Sabha elections and their choice becomes another party in the assembly elections
 congress ke isi paramparaagat vot ko bijepi apane paale main laane ke liye paswan ko trump card ke rup main istemaal kiya he
 Feroze Naqvi, a senior journalist who has closely watched the politics of Rae bareli-amethi, says Ram Vilas Paswan has not landed in Amethi and Rae Bareli for the first time
 wo isse pehle congress ke paksh main or virodh main donon main raily kar chuke hai
 But the Pasi of this area could not win the heart of the community
 unhone kaha ki ramvilas paswan dushaadh jati se aate hai
 This is the reason why the Pasi community of Awadh has never accepted them and could not connect with them
 firoz nakvi kehete hai ki paswan jab upie kaa hissaa the to sonia gandhi or rahul gandhi ke liye vot maangane aae the, lekin jo paasi samudaay ke log basapa se jude the wo vahiin rahe congress ke saath nahin aae
 In such a situation, it is difficult to say that his efforts will bring color to BJP
 haalanki amethi main rahul gandhi ke khilaaf bijepi ke liye paswan ke dwaara vot maangane se congress ke saath unke rishte bighad jane kaa khatra bhi raajnneetik pandit maan rahe hai
 After campaigning in Amethi, it may be difficult for Ram Vilas Paswan to enter the Congress camp under any political circumstances
 lekin firoz nakvi is baat se sahamat nahin he
 He says that Sharad Yadav contested the first election against Rajiv Gandhi and is with him today
 isi tarah se indira gandhi ke khilaaf chikmagalore main indira gandhi ke khilaaf chunavi taal thokane vaale baad main unheen ke cabinet main mantri the
 However, Smriti Irani has been active in Amethi since the 2014 Lok Sabha elections and has taken several steps to help the Pasi community
 is kadi main unhone jagadishpur se vidhayak suresh paasi ko kaaphi aage badhaayaa or yogi sarkaar main mantri banavaane main ahm bhoomika nibhaai he
 As a result, many BJP mlas in Amethi are considered angry with Smriti Irani
 varisht patrkaar firoz nakvi kehete hai ki raajnneeti main ganit se zyada chemistry kaam aati he
 Like in chemistry, when two things are mixed together, the third thing also becomes
 isi tarah se jab ek jati duusari jati se milti he to teesri jati ke log chhitakate bhi hai
 In such a situation, if the BJP is able to join the Pasi community, then the chances of the Rajput or Brahmin will be dispersed
 ab yah baat to 23 may ko hi pataa chal sakegaa

 There was a lot of uproar in the Delhi Assembly on Monday over the rights of the Aam Aadmi Party government and the LG office
 sadan main dilli sarkaar ke alag-alag vibhaagon se jude vidhayakon ke sawaal kaa jawaab naa milane par spikar ram nivas goyal ne naaraazgi jaahir kii he
 There was a big ruckus in the House of ministers, legislators and officials for not presenting the report of 20 years of foreign tours
 spikar ramanivas goyal ne vidhayakon dwaara prashn puche jane ke maamle main sadan ke bheetar alji ke patr ko padhakar sunaaya
 Ram Niwas Goyal told the House that the LG has written to him saying that he cannot accept any questions related to the department like Delhi Legislative Speaker Services, Vigilance, Land
 spikar ne aage alji ke patr par aapatti jataate hue kaha, 'dilli main angrejon kaa shashan lagane kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 If the rape takes place in Delhi, can't the mlas raise questions in the Assembly? What a spectacle LG has made vidhayakon ke sawaal kaa adhikari jawaab kyon nahin dete hai? prashnon kaa jawaab na milanaa sadan kii avmaananaa he or adhikariyon ko vidhansabha main puche gaye tamaam prashnon kaa jawaab dena chahie
 Amid the uproar, Manish Sisodia told Nesadan that if any response comes from the Delhi Police, DDA or Services, the Minister of the concerned department is informed and signed
 lekin sidhe spikar ke paas agar koi jaanakri aa rahi he to yah asanvaidhanik he, isaki jaanch kii jarurat he
 Sisodia further said that Delhi Legislative Assembly has been formed under the Constitution and Babu sitting in the Home Ministry office will not decide how the Delhi Assembly will run
 sisodiya ne kaha, 'dilli vidhansabha kisi kii bapauti nahin, balki dilli waalon kii bapauti he
 Who is the MLA, where is the officer, why is the information being hidden? If 6 ministers had been asked, everyone would have got the information by now
 inhen dar he ki videsh yatraaon kii jaankaree mil gai to kai adhikariyon, mantriyon kaa kaala sach saamne aa jayega
 BJP was opposed in the House for not getting the answer on the question of foreign visits

 Both questions fall under the jurisdiction of this Assembly and should be answered

 Last month, the ED approached the Supreme Court seeking permission to transfer 42 officers investigating coal block allocation cases
 sheersh adaalat ne koyala ghotaalaa maamalon kii jaanch karne vaali sabhi agenciyon ke adhikariyon ko bina anumati ke sthanantarit karne par roak laga rakhi he
 ED sources said the move was aimed at speeding up the investigation into the coal scam

 Money laundering cases were registered against two ED officials
 kapur kehete hai, ''idi ab suvyavasthit ho rahaa he
 Due to the power given under the PMLA, some ED officials were extorting, terrorizing the business class
 ''piemele ko atal bihari vaajapeyi ke netritv vaali endie sarkaar ne paas kiya tha jisase idi main bade paimaane par badlaav aayaa
 However, this law came into effect from 2005
 vidambnaa dekhie, tab chidambaram hi vitt mantri hua karte the
 Advocate Vijay Pal Dalmiya says the ambiguity in the PMLA can be confusing if the ED officials are excited
 ve kehete hai, ''kis vyakti ko kab giraftaar kiya ja saktaa he, isko lekar koi spashtataa hi nahin he
 Dalmiya says that prior to the 2019 amendment, the ED could attach the property only if it had sufficient grounds to believe that the property had been earned from that 'crime proceeds' and the accused would investigate it
 Could also sell during daalamia kehete hai, ''vah sampatti pehle se hi kisi anya agency ne atech kar di ho to bhi agency ne us sampatti ko atech karne kii maang kii he
 How can such property be disposed of? PMLA needs more modifications
 ''kisi vyakti ne piemele ke 29 kanoonon or 160 dhaaraon ke tahat koi aparaadh kiya he, to usase arjeet dhan yaa isse arjeet sampatti ko 'aparaadh kii aay' ghoshit kiya ja saktaa he or idi aise dhan yaa sampatti ko atech kar saktaa he
 In 2015, this definition was expanded to allow eds to attach assets of equal value to that property in India if the accused transfers the money out of the country
 2019 ke sanshodhano main anusuchit aparaadh se sambandhit kisi bhi aapraadhik gatividhi ke madhyam se arjeet kii gai puunji or parisampatti shaamil hai, bhale hi yah piemele ke tahat na ho
 The biggest blot for the ED is his poor crime conviction record
 piemele ke tahat 2005 ke baad se darj kiye gaye 2,500 se adhik maamalon main se keval 18 main aparaadh siddh hua he
 Prosecution complaints have been filed in about 689 cases — more than 450 cases have been filed in the last four years
 sakriyata main is teji kaa shrey karnal singh ke kaarykaal main hue prashasnic sudhaaron ko diya ja saktaa he, jinhone adhikariyon ko pravartan nideshaalay main shaamil karne se pehle un adhikariyon kii satarkta jaanch karaae jane kii niti shuru kii thi
 ED officers were also provided incentives on the lines of 'special Investigation Promotion' to be given to CBI officers
 deshbhar main chah samarpit forencik lab or chaape ke dauraan hardware ko shighrata se clon karne ke liye field forencik kit uplabdh karaae gaye
 "the officers were given regular monthly training," explains Karnal Singh
 ''piemele ne idi ko shashakt banaaya he, to iske saamne ek badi baadha yah he ki yah apane aap koi maamla darj nahin kar saktaa
 Another agency, such as the CBI or the state police, has to first file the required criminal case on the basis of which the ED can file an ECIR
 idi swatantra rup se shikaayatein praapt kar saktaa he or iske sambandh main maamla darj karne ke liye sambandhit agency ko bhejne se pehle apane praavdhaanon ke tahat pehle do str kii jaanch kar saktaa he—tii1 (praathmik) or tii2 (vistrut jaanch)
 In December 2016, the ED wrote to the CBI about irregularities in the INX Media case
 sibiai ne may 2017 main is sandarbh main ek aapraadhik maamla darj kiya
 Lack of coordination between agencies and limited flow of information from abroad also hamper investigation
 idi ke adhikariyon kaa daawa he ki bharat ke bheetar hue galat kaamon ke saboot ikattha karnaa aasaan he, lekin videshon ke maamalon main yah bahut mushkil he
 For example, in the 2G case, eight out of 10 countries were contacted for information about alleged money laundering, but the letter of request sent to those countries did not respond
 ye desh rus, yuai, norge, cyprus, morishas, libya, oil of main, british virgin islands, france or singapore hai
 ED officials claim that the second phase is delayed in the courts
 idi abhiyojan kii shikaayatein, jo police kii chargeshit ke baraabar hoti hai, sambandhit adaalaton main daakhil karata he
 The number of such courts is gradually increasing
 dilli kii sabhi satr adaalatein ab idi adaalatein hai
 Most experts agree that the length of a case in courts depends on two factors — the efficiency of the ED and political interference
 isliye satta kiske haathon main he, uske aadhaar par, kuch maamalon main teji aa jaati he to anya maamle dhime ho jate hai
 ED officials say that the Directorate prepares irrefutable cases despite working under various constraints
 unka tark he ki idi ne agar 15 varshon main keval 18 logon ko doshi sabit karaayaa to keval ek hi vyakti bari bhi hua
 Das points out some major achievements — not a single case is lost against the agency Vijay Mallya and Nirav Modi and both of them were jailed in Britain due to the evidence presented by the ED
 haal ke dinon main aatank kii funding se jude 13 maamle darj kiye gaye hai
 All these works have happened when the ED is working on half its strength
 idi ke liye sweekrut karmiyon kii sankhya 2,024 he jabaki philhal isamen sirf 1,005 adhikari kaam kar rahe hai
 Despite being so paralyzed, the ED attached assets worth more than Rs 55,000 crore between 2014 and 2019 under the PMLA

 Comments ghatana kii soochna is police thane main gaanv ke sarpanch ne di
 Police reached the spot and brought Sikh sevadars to the police station

 in avasheshon ko dilli ke laal kile main laayaa gaya he
 According to archaeological department experts, the remains belong to a royal warrior family
 haalanki puratatvvid abhi ise kisi nishchit nasl yaa sabhyataa se jodna munasib nahin samajhate, lekin yah baat gaur karne kii he ki khudaai sthal sanauli kauravon kii rajdhani maane jane vaale hastinapur ke paas sthit he
 The period of Mahabharata is also believed to be around 2000 BCE (BC)
 laal kile main in avasheshon par research kar rahe puratatvvid arvin or sanjay manjul ne hamaare sahyogi prakaashan mail today ko bataaya ki inako lekar kai tarah ke pareekshan or adhyayan kiye ja rahe hai

 instituteof orcyology ke nideshak sanjay manjul ne kaha ki isse pracheen itihaas ke adhyayan ko ek nayaa aayam milegaa

 Sincerely in / mail-today) sibiai ne wiesar congress party pramukh evam andhra pradesh ke kadappa se saansad wies jaganmohan reddy ke kai parisaron par guuruuvaar ko chaape maare
 There are allegations that the investment in Jagan's companies was made in favor of his father and the then Chief Minister YS Rajasekhara Reddy
 sibiai ne andhra pradesh ucch nyaayalay ke nirdeshon par bhartiya dand samhita or bhrashtachar rokthaam adhinium ke sambandhit praavdhaanon ke tahat maamla darj kiya
 CBI spokesperson Dharini Mishra said in Delhi that raids have been conducted in Hyderabad, Bangalore, Chennai, Kolkata, Rajkot, Delhi and Mumbai in this case
 unhone kaha, sibiai ne andhra pradesh ucch nyaayalay ke aadesh par andhra pradesh se ek sansad sadsy or anya logon ke khilaaf maamla darj kiya he
 It is alleged that the huge amount of investment by investors in companies owned by Member of Parliament was done in lieu of taking sides by the then Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh
 andhra pradesh ucch nyaayalay ne rajya ke kapadaa mantri pi shankar raav or tedepa netaa yeran naidu kii alag-alag yachikaaon par jagan kii kathith avaidh sampatti kii haal hi main sibiai jaanch kaa aadesh diya tha

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi's honeymoon period is undoubtedly left behind, but the figures are still visible in his court
 unhone satta main khumaar bharaa pehla saal puraa kar liya he, is maukey par india today group-sisero snap pole main shaamil 56 fisadi uttardaataaon ne bijepi ke netritv vaali endie sarkaar ke kaamkaaj ko acha bataaya he
 The good news does not stop here: bjp's vote share has increased, though it is quite modest after the Lok Sabha elections
 haalanki, is surveykshan ke sabase chaunkaane vaale nattejey is baat ko lekar hai ki kisaanon or garibon se jude muddon kii andekhi karne kaa aarope lagaakar vipakshi dal modi sarkaar kii korporate jagat kaa saath dene ke liye aalochana kar rahe hai, vahiin inamen unki garib samarthak chhavi main oochaal darj hua he
 In the India Today country mood survey conducted in March, this figure was 16 per cent, which has now reached 23 per cent
 lekin modi ke liye raahat katai nahin he kyonki 7,652 uttardaataaon main se 30 fisadi maanate hai ki satta main unke pehle saal kii sabase badi naakaami kisaanon kii chintaaon ko dur nahin kar paanaa he
 Of these, 43 per cent believe that Rahul Gandhi has rightly called the NDA a 'suit boot government'
 centre kii satta main modi sarkaar ke pehle saal ke kaarykaal par kiye gaye surveykshan ke nattejey saamne hai
 People want to give them time right now, but also issue a warning together
 apane 33 fisadi samarthan ke saath modi ab bhi desh kaa netritv karne ke laayak sabase upyukt shaks bane hue hai
 But at the same time, we should not forget that the latest figures are much lower than the 57% support Modi received in the India Today Group's Mood of the Nation survey in August 2014
 46 fisadi logon kaa ab bhi yah maananaa he ki ve ab tak unki aakankshaon par khare nahin utar paae hai
 More than half of the surveyed respondents, 53 per cent, have not yet realized Modi's promise of 'achhe Din'
 or bhi kai chintaaen hai, unamem se kuch unke communication se judi ranneeti se sambandhit hai
 Despite all the hustle and bustle on Twitter trends and hashtags, the condition is that 72 per cent of people do not follow them on social media and hence miss out on the message broadcast on this medium
 modi or unke mantriyon ko jald-se-jald jameen par aana hoga or apane kiye vaade puure karne honge

 Peta India has said that the order of February 17, 2017 and April 10, 2017 on two cases related to killing and sacrificing animals for meat, the Supreme Court had said that slaughter of animals can be done only in slaughterhouses with official license

 a question is troubling Indian cricket lovers these days
 vah sawaal yah he ki aakhirkaar england daure main bhartiya team kii haar kaa silsilaa kab samaapt hoga
 Will the series break through the third ODI at the Oval on Friday? This is a fundamental question, but apart from this, the Indian cricket team is surrounded by many questions
 in dinon bhartiya khilaadiyon kii fitness sawaalon ke ghere main he, unki kaabiliyat sawaalon ke ghere main he, unki taiyaari sawaalon ke ghere main he
 His commitment and dedication to Test cricket is under question
 england daure main apane kai pramukh khilaadiyon kii chot or kharaab pradarshan se pareshaan bhartiya team ab tak chaar test match, ek twanti-20 match or ek ekadivasiy match ganvaa chuki he
 He won three practice matches, but looking at the second ODI, it seemed that it had no effect on his morale
 lagaataar haar se pareshaan captain mahendra singh dhoni ab sawaalon se itane ghabara gaye hai ki vah khud hi patrakaron se sawaal kar rahe hai
 For example, what can i do? 
 
 
 There was a time when Danadan, the winning captain, needed to stop speaking, but now he seems to have less words
 doosraa vanade match 23-23 overon tak simit kiye jane ke baad jis tarah kii shuruyaat mili thi, use dekhakar yahi laga tha ki tabadatod cricket main maahir ho chuki bhartiya team yah match jitkar haar ke silsile ko tod degi lekin gendbaajon ne ballebaajon kii mehnat par pani pher diya
 Whenever the Indian bowlers do well, the batsmen lose their hard work and when the batsmen do well, the bowlers beat the whole strategy
 yah sab aatmavishvaas kii kami ke kaaran ho rahaa he or yah aatmavishvaas tabhi lautega jab team ko ek badi jeet milegi
 The third ODI will also be played amidst the shadow of rain, as it is a rainy season in England
 aise main bhartiya khilaadiyon ko apana wicket bachaae rakhte hue twanti-20 vaali maansikta ke saath khilne ko taiyaar rahanaa hoga
 In the midst of all this, it has to be kept in mind that the opportunity to equalize the loss of the Indian players in the Test series is not missed
 mahendra singh dhoni or unke saathiyon ko yah yaad rakhana hoga ki test shrunkhlaa main unhone sarvocch variyata praapt team ke taur par apni saakh ganvaai he, lekin ekadivasiy shrunkhlaa main maujuuda vishwa champion ke taur par unki saakh daanv par he
 This credibility could be in jeopardy after the loss at the Oval, as they would lose their chance to win the series after trailing 0–2
 unniis sau nabbe ke dashak ke shuruaati daur ke mandal virdohi andolan main sangharsh kii rekhaaen spasht thim jo iskaa samarthan kar rahe the, unhen ghor 'jativaadee' qaraar diya gaya tha
 It was a label that was synonymous with being 'anti-genius'
 aisa darshaya gaya tha ki yah virodh jaateey vajahon se nahin balki desh main yogyata ko lekar vaastavik chintaa se prerit he
 It was reinforcing the same orthodox mindset that competence or ability is inherently in upper-caste people
 vastav main aarakshan kaa virodh karne vaale samaan rup se apni jati ke prati satark or jativaadee the
 In fact, they were cleverly taking care of talent for the protection of the privileges of their caste
 un jatigat visheshadhikaron ko ve apana haq samajhate the or usamen se ratti bhar bhi kisi ke saath baantne ko taiyaar na the
 The anti-reservation movement that started in Gujarat in the mid-1980s, condemned reservation and those who achieved it
 aarakshan kii jarurat ko kamajori ke taur par bataaya ja rahaa tha, use vaastavik 'yogyata' kii kami se joda jaataa tha
 Opponents of reservation said that 'people without merit' would become a burden on the government
 tab anusuchit jati ke logon sarkari damaad kah diya jaataa tha
 Previously the public sector was the dominant sector of employment which was slowly retreating from its role, with the domestic economy being increasingly privatized and globalized
 sarkaar har cheez par apana niyantran rakhane kii puraani niti se peeche hatate hue dheel dene kii niti par aage bad rahi thi to aarthik unnati ke nae avasaron ke khulne kii ummid thi
 Possibilities of new types of jobs were being born
 saath hi, nirantar aarthik vikaas kii badaulat naukariyon kii sankhya main vruddhi kii aas bhi thi
 With this optimism, some mixed changes were seen in the anti-reservation discourse
 jab baahar ek ujjwal, chamakdaar or lagaataar tarakkee karti duniya baanhen failaae khadi he to phir is andhere or dhundhale saarvajanik kshetra main aarakshan kii kise jarurat he?yah to tab kii baat he
 Come straight to 2014
 sthir vikaas ke upie sarkaar ke do kaarykaal ke baavjood, is dauraan bade paimaane par hue bhrashtachar ke kaaran bharat main bechaini thi
 Though the rate of growth was good, the rate of growth in jobs was very slow (in this case certainly the worst time of upa's reign is also better than the best time of nda's reign)
 2014 ke chunaav abhiyaanon main bhaajapa kii aguai main ek majboot sarkaar main aseem samruddhi kii sambhaavnaaon ko nae par lag jaaenge, isi mrigatrushna ne asankhya bharatiyon ko moh liya
 Many generous people also became fascinated
 modi ke netritv main vikaas kii aandhi kii aas main unhone gujarat main musalamaanon ke khilaaf hui hinsa ke ateet kii andekhi karte hue modi ke liye palak paanvade bicha die or endie ko prachand jeet mili
 Clearly, the past five years have not seen the kind of growth that was claimed, nor has there been any reduction in the attractiveness of government jobs
 jis vikaas kii sunami kii baaten hui thim par uskaa ek bavandar bhi nahin uth sakaa
 Doubling agricultural income; With the return of black money deposited abroad, every Indian promises to bring 15 lakh rupees to his account, such as all the promises of prosperity and most importantly the promise of putting a flood of jobs has become a cruel mirage
 neshnal sample survey orgenigeshan (eneseso) ke aavadhik shram bal surveykshan kii 2017-18 kii report, jise sarkaar ne to dabaa diya tha lekin bijness standard akhbaar ne use saarvajanik kar diya
 This report shows that unemployment of young men in rural areas rose to 17 in 2017-18
 4 fisad ho gai he jo ki 2011-12 main 5 pratishat thi
 At the same time, unemployment of women in rural areas increased to 13 in 2017-18
 6 fisad ho gai, jo 2011-12 main 4
 It was 8 percent
 iskaa matlab yah he ki arthvyavastha na keval paryaapt sankhya main nae rojgaar paidaa karne main vifal rahi balki vibhinn sarkari yojanaayen bhi aarthik sankat kii sthiti ko sanbhaalane main sakasham nahin thim
 During this period there was again a tremendous rise in the demand for reservation quota
 jis teji ke saath gujarat main patidaar, haryana main jat, andhra pradesh main kapu—jaise sampann, jameenon ke maalik or rajnatik rup se prabhaavshaalee samudaayon ne sarkaar or saarvajanik kshetron main rojgaar ke avasaron kii ore rukh kiya he or naukariyon tathaa ucch shiksha main aarakshan kii maang kar rahe hai, yah is baat kaa sanket he ki in samudaayon kaa ek bada hissaa paryaapt rup se tarakkee nahin kar sakaa he
 Their demand to be included in the reservation quota shows that they are looking for good jobs and stable sources of livelihood for their youth as the traditional sources of their livelihood have remained unreliable due to the widespread and multifaceted agricultural crisis
 ve arthvyavastha main aae un sanrachanaatmak badlaavon, jo unke liye phydemand nahin hai, ke kaaran jitna bhi asurakshit mahasoos kar sakate hon, pramukh jatiyon ke bich kota hasil karne kii is maaramaari kii vidambnaa spasht he
 Firstly, they are willing to give up their request that reservation is the identity of weak or incompetent people
 duusari, aap kisi bhi saamaajik aarthik sanketak kaa vishleshan karke dekh len, ucch or (gaiyr-obisi) prabhaavshaalee jatiyaan tathaa samudaay hi, inamen sheersh par bane rahete hai
 The opportunities that were open to jobs were mainly occupied by those who were in the race for development or were able to take advantage of English language and technical skills
 adhiktar mahatvapurn suchakaankon par jatigat antar kam nahin hua he or jatiyon ke bich jo oonch-neech aitihaasik rup se chali aa rahi he usamen bhi koi bada ulat-pher nahin hua he
 If we put it plainly, not all members of the upper and dominant castes benefited from market-led development
 lekin jinhen iskaa laabh mila ve aarthik rup se behatar or saamaajik rup se pehle se hi prabhaavshaalee jatiyon se the
 nda's response to the economic crisis The BJP leadership is blaming the Congress' actions of the last 70 years as a strategy to divert attention from the poor economic record of the last five years
 bhaajapa nehru par itnaa focus tareeke se hamalavar he ki agar koi soch le ki nehru kaa nidhan asal main 1964 main hua hi nahin tha to isamen koi hairaani nahin
 Other efforts to divert attention from economic failures include some sloganeering slogans, old schemes (renamed the Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan Swachh Bharat Abhiyan), or vigorously promoted programs that have no existence on the ground Not only (beti Bachao Beti Padhao, Make in India or Smart City)
 agar bharat main nae kaushal kaa istemaal hi nahin kiya ja saktaa, to phir skill india jaisi yojanaayen nirarthak hai
 The only two big bang economic steps were demonetisation and GST
 vidambnaa ki notebandi to puri tarah se ek aarthik aapadaa sabit hui
 The GST framework was prepared by the UPA and implemented by the NDA
 lekin jiesti kaa karyanvayan bahut hi zyada kharaab tareeke se hua
 The 124th Constitutional Amendment was the last major step to cover up economic mismanagement and failure just before the elections
 iskaa uddeshy saamaanya shrenee ke 'aarthik rup se kamjor virgon' (edablyooes) ko naukariyon or shaikshik sansthaanon main 10 fisad aarakshan pradaan karnaa he
 This is a historic step, not because it would be helpful in furthering quotas for marginalized or disadvantaged groups, but because it has reversed the basic concept of reservation
 aarthik aadhaar par aarakshan ke is cote ke bare main bataaya gaya he ki yah gaiyr-essi / asti jatiyon ke 'aarthik rup se kamjor virgon' (edablyooes) ke liye he
 This indicates two changes in the government's positive initiatives policy
 ek to yah ki samaaj ke jatigat padanukram main nicha hone kaa arth yah nahin ki vah aarthik yaa saamaajik pichhadepan kaa suchak ho
 And second, that reservation is not specifically meant to remove caste-based discrimination
 iske atirikt edablyooes kaa darja ek asangat naam haih prati varsh 8 lakh rupye kii aay seemaa kaa matlab he ki sabhi pariwaron main se 97 fisad iske paatr hai
 The government wants to signal to the upper castes that it is ready to move away from a policy framework that guarantees reimbursement of discrimination against Dalits and tribals
 is ghoshnaa ke baad, ghrinaa or khule taur par jativaadee nafrat kii aarakshan-virdohi sunami nadaarad pai gai
 Earlier, the upper castes, who had thrashed the agreement on merit with caste-based reservation, openly welcomed this change
 aajeevika ke apane paaramparik kaaryon ko kar rahe daliton kii linching, goraksha ke naam par unki aajeevika chhinana, antarjaateey vivaah karne ke kaaran un par hinsa or mandir main pravesh se lekar kanoonee rup se avaidh ghoshit chuaachhut kaa virodh karne par jheli ja rahi hinsa ko agar isamen jod diya jaae to sari baaten ekadam diwaar par likhi ibaarat kii tarah spasht hai
 The ruling coalition is looking for ways to take away the rights given to Dalits
 bayaanbaji chaahe jitani bhi kar lee jaae par jati-mukt vyavastha ke nirmaan kii bhaavana nahin he
 The motive is simply to blunt the rights of those castes who are marginalized and who have been discriminated against
 kya yah vot main badal paaegaa?savarna hinduon ke bich apni paith ko majboot karne ke alaava, bhaajapa ko yah bhi ummid he ki aarakshan kii ghoshnaa kar dene se vah naukari ke morche par nirnaayak kadam uthaane kaa bhram paidaa karne main safal ho jaaegi
 In the next one month, it will be clear whether voters are able to see the truth behind this blurred picture — that adding new stakeholders to the jobs opportunities that are constantly declining, does not guarantee better livelihood
 can
 hamen ek badhati arthvyavastha kii jarurat he, jo hamaare yuvaaon or berozegaar aabaadi ke liye utpaadak rojgaar kii vyavastha karne main sakasham ho
 The economic crisis is a reality: the revised GDP growth rate shows that the Indian economy grew faster than the UPA-II tenure during the NDA tenure
 lekin yah sanshodhan daal main kuch kaala hone kaa ishaara karata he kyonki aarthik gatishiltaa ke anya sanketak (iskar vruddhi, car bikri, railway ke yatri rajasav ke aankade, cement utpaadan aadi) sarkaar kii ore se pesh kii gai is gulabi tasviir kii chugali kar dete hai
 Open unimplementation is the highest in the last five decades
 krishi, abhi bhi adhiktar bharatiyon ke liye aajeevika kaa strot he, lekin yah badhati laagat or anishchit aay ke chalate buree tarah sankatagrast he
 Reservation for all is not a solution to this problem
 aarakshan kii aavashyaktaa haashie par khadey or samaaj ke sabase vanchit samoohon ke liye he; or rojgaar kaa prabandh sabake liye jaruri he
 Instead of a good day, in the last five years we have seen the charge and madness of the conservative, majoritarian, fundamentalist and communal government
 uski ore se bharat ke vichaar ko phir se is tarah likhane kii koshishen hoti dikhin jo samvidhan kii mul pariklpana se ekadam ulat he
 It is expected that voters will understand the implications and truth of the announcements that have been made regarding the new quota in reservation, that they are just a waxing jumble
 ummid he, ve nai sarkaar ko naukariyon kii baari maang ko puraa karne main sakasham arthvyavastha kaa khaakaa khinchne kii jimmedaari saunpenge

 din tha shanivaar, jab aadhikarik taur par bihar main chuttee hoti he, or patna ke bichobich sthit purana sachivalay apekshit rup se lagbhag khaali tha
 Arriving at his office on the first floor, Nitish drank a cup of tea

 After a brief discussion with senior officials, Nitish reached the conference hall
 vahaan police or grih vibhaag ke sheersh adhikariyon ke saath lagbhag dhai ghante tak baithak chali
 After this meeting, he held a video conference with district magistrates and superintendents of police across the state
 baarikiyon main jane or police adhikshakon se saptahik aparaadh samiksha karne ke liye kehane se pehle, nitish ne kaha, ''adhikariyon ko yah pataa lagane ke liye ki jameen par kya ho rahaa he (apane karyaalayon se) baahar nikalnaa chahie

 Perhaps this was more so because the burden of the past — the rule of the alliance partners Lalu Prasad and later Rabri Devi, often referred to as the 'jungle Raj' —and his own specialty of good governance standing in sharp contrast, gave Nitish the law
 And forced to start by paying attention to the system

 Nitish, who led the Grand Alliance, winning 178 out of 243 seats in Bihar, is well aware of the challenges to come

 While he is the head of the government, Lalu is the surveyor of the party with more mlas

 But Lalu too has recovered his share by making his younger son Tejashwi Yadav a deputy MLA for the first time

 '' or nitish ko sahamat hona padaa
 When both RJD and Congress were eyeing the post of Assembly Speaker, Nitish's desire to give this post to his party is very important

 Uday Narayan Chaudhary, who held the post from 2005 to 2015, was instrumental in maintaining the JD (U) government despite a slight majority after Nitish broke ties with the BJP in June 2013
 farvari 2014 main choudhary ne bihar main rajnatik tufaan paidaa kar diya tha, jab unhone argedy ke 22 vidhayakon main se 13 ko asambaddha sadasyon ke rup main adhishuchet kiya tha
 This was apparently done without paying any heed to the anti-defection law, under which 13 members could not be allowed to be divided from a 22-member party
 pichley varsh aktubar-november main choudhary ne jedy (you) ke aath vidhayakon ko netritv kaa virodh karne par ayogy ghoshit kar diya tha
 Even when Jitanram Manjhi revolted against Nitish in january-february this year with BJP support, he blamed Chaudhary for his decision to resign without facing the Assembly
 chunaav main choudhary maanjhi ke haathon haar chuke hai
 Vijay Chaudhary, another confidant of Nitish and former Water Resources Minister in the previous cabinet, has been hinted to take over as the new speaker
 nitish ne grih or saamaanya prashasan ke pramukh vibhaagon ko apane paas rakhaa he, jo unhen kanoon-vyavastha or sarkari mashinari par sidhi nigaraanee rakhane kaa mauka dete hai
 This makes them free to transfer vigilance and information officers as well as IAS and IPS officers to spread their message to curb corruption
 nitish ne apane saat vaadon ko lagu karne ke liye mahatvapurn vibhaagon ko bhi jedy (you)vidhayakon ko hi saunpa he, in vaadon main 2
 70 lakh crores Rs
 kii laagat vaala 'vijan dastavej' bhi he, jise nitish ne bihar ke liye pradhanmantri ke 1
 25 lakhs
 karod ke package ke jawaab main 29 agast ko jari kiya tha
 The electricity for which Nitish paid Rs 55,600 crore
 lagane kaa vaada kiya tha, vah vibhaag jedy (you) ke bijendra prasad yadav ko aavantit kiya gaya he, jabaki mukhyamantri kii pasandida gaanv sadak yojana ko gramin nirmaan vibhaag lagu karegaa jo jedy (you) ke hi shailesh kumaar ko saunpa gaya he
 1 of Bihar
 95 karod gharon ko pipeline sulabh karaane ke nitish ke vaade ko puraa karne kii jimmedaari lok swasthya yantriki vibhaag par he jo krishnanandan prasad verma ke supurd he
 Lalu's strength in the House and his past record indicate that he is capable of bending the arm of the government
 lekin jedy (you) ke sutron kaa daawa he ki nitish dabaav main nahin aaenge
 "an unwritten rule of coalition politics got him involved in Lalu's sons," says a top party leader
 nitish udaar ho sakate hai, sarkaar banaae rakhane ke liye had se aage jane ke liye bhi taiyaar hai, lekin jab baat unki chhavi kii aati he to ve samjhauta nahin kar sakate
 They will not let anyone weaken the credibility of the government
 '' congress ke ek netaa bhi lalu ke dabaav banane kii ashankaon ko khaarij karte hue kehete hai, ''naukarshahon ko kabhi-kabhaar phone kiya jayega, lekin tejasvi or tej pratap ko shaamil kiya janaa or unhen tathakthith khuli chhot dena nitish kumaar sarkaar kii nirantarata ke liye ek bime kii tarah ho saktaa he
 However, unlike BJP, Lalu could hardly be a humble coalition partner
 phir bhi ve ek dashak ke rajnatik vanvaas ke baad satta main laute hai or unke jald hi adchane paidaa karne kii ummid nahin he
 The first challenge to this friendship may emerge in the Rajya Sabha elections next year, when Nitish may have the option of choosing just two, after the scheduled retirement of five JD (U) mps, as the other two seats are for Lalu and the last one
 The seat will be in bjp's pocket
