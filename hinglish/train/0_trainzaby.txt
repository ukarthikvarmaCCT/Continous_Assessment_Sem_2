 There is also a provision of punishment under GST
 kya jiesti ke tahat giraftaar ke praavdhaan hai
 Is it a little silly that will lead you to jail, is it a doubt or is it really so
 ye bhi jaanane kaa prayaas karte hai
 Suresh ji has written in Hindi that under Section 69 of GST, provisions for arrest have been given
 agar kisi ne 132 ke tahat aparaadh kiya he to giraftaar ho saktaa he
 The CGST officer will make the arrest and the order will be that of the commissioner
 kuch aparaadh gair jamaanti hai or kuch jamaanti
 Arrests will not be held without the order of the Commissioner
 bina bill kaa maal supplai karenge, kar chori ke iraade se
 One can go to jail for issuing a bill without GST
 jiesti lekar teen maheene tak jamaa nahin karne par jail jaaenge
 If there is theft of more than 2 crores then the provisions of arrest apply
 yani 2 karod se kam kii kar chori par jail jane se batch sakate hai
 The medium and small range dealer need not fear
 magar aap do baar jiesti kaa ulanghan karte hai to jail ja sakate hai
 Then it will not be seen whether there is a charge of tax evasion of 2 crores
 0 pratishat, 5 pratishat, 12 pratishat, 18 pratishat or 28 pratishat tex hai jiesti ke tahat
 If essential commodities are kept out of GST, then there are many things that will come under the tax ambit for the first time
 integrated jiesti koi nayaa kar nahin he balki nayaa tantra he
 Through this, the trade between the two states will be monitored
 kaha ja rahaa he ki isse prakriyaayein thodi jatil ho jaaengi
 How complicated it would be when i started reading it
 phir chhod diya baaki aap jo vigyapanon main chapa he use dekhakar samaj len
 Although Suresh ji has explained it in a very simple way, but due to timeliness and vigor on TV, we are leaving him
 itihaas ban rahaa he to thodi mehnat aap bhi kiijie
 Now come to the return
 har maheene teen ritern bharne honge jo ek-duusare se alag honge
 GSTR-1 will be the details of the monthly sales which have to be submitted by the 10th of the next month
 GSTR-2 masik kharid kaa vivaran hoga jo agle maah kii 15 taarikh tak jamaa karnaa hoga
 Can't submit before 10 date because you have to submit the details of the sale till ten, so you will have to submit the details of the purchase only after the 15th
 GSTR-3 ye masik kar kaa ritern he jo agle maah kii 20 taarikh tak jamaa karne honge
 GSTR-9 is the annual return which has to be submitted by 31 December after the end of the financial year
 is prakaar puure saal main 37 ritern bharne honge
 The GSTN network created by the government will have to be returned
 aap pehle bhi waite vagairah online hi bhar rahe the
 Sudhir Hhalakhandi has written that it will have to work very hard to follow the provisions related to it, but also to adhere to the difficult time limit because till the first seller returns, the buyer will not be able to fill his returns
 aisa hote hi puri chen main brake aa jayega or system ko pataa chal jayega
 Only two months have been given to correct this gap
 agar pehle dealer ne ritern nahin bharaa, dukaan band kar gaayab ho gaya to jo jiesti aapane use di he, utani hi rakam aap dobaaraa bharenge
 If the idea of the former changed and filled it, you will get that amount back
 ab aap kahenge ki hamen kaise maaloom ki jisase maal kharid rahe hai wo dealer bharosemand he
 So for this, the rating of dealers will be given on the site of GST
 har vyapaaree duusare vyapaaree kii reating dekh sakegaa jo jiestn kii site par hogi
 Now come to the bill
 1 july ko aap apni dukaan par jate hai
 If you sell goods to the customer then how to deduct the first GST bill
 jiesti ke tahat aap computer ke alaava apni bill book bhi chhapava sakate hai
 Suppose you are a cloth merchant
 shanivaar ko aapaki dukaan par koi graahak pahunchataa he or 100 shart kharidta he to bill kaise banaayenge
 You should have a total of 15 types of information
 vikreta or karidaar kaa naam, pataa or jiestn number zarur hona chahie
 The date of issue of the bill should also be its serial number
 maal kaa vivaran, maatra or kul keemat aapako darj karnaa hoga
 Dealer signatures are mandatory
 har bill kii teen prati hogi
 One you will keep, the other with the buyer and the third for the transporter
 ise aapako chhapava kar rakh lenaa chahie

 There is also a provision of punishment under GST
 kya jiesti ke tahat giraftaar ke praavdhaan hai

 If essential commodities are kept out of GST, then there are many things that will come under the tax ambit for the first time
 ab aate hai ritern par
 Three returns have to be filed every month which will be different from each other
 GSTR-1, masik bikri kaa vivaran hoga jo agle maheene kii das taarikh tak jamaa karnaa hoga
 GSTR-2 will be the details of the monthly purchase which has to be submitted by the 15th of the next month
 10 taarikh se pehle jamaa nahin kar sakate kyonki aapako das tak bikri kaa vivaran jamaa karnaa hoga, isliye aap kharid kaa vivaran 10 ke baad hi 15 taarikh tak jamaa karne honge
 GSTR-3 This is the monthly tax return which has to be submitted by the 20th of the following month
 GSTR-9 ye vaarshik ritern he jo vitt varsh kii samaapti ke baad 31 disambar tak jamaa karne honge
 Thus, 37 returns have to be filled in the entire year
 yah ritern sarkaar ne jo jiestn network banaaya he vahaan jaakar bharne honge
 In the past, you were paying VAT and filling online only
 sudhir halaakhandee ne likhaa he ki isse jude praavdhaanon ke paalan ke liye kaaphi mehnat kerani hogi, balki samay kii mushkil seemaa kaa bhi paalan karnaa hoga kyonki jabatak pehla vikreta ritern nahin bharegaa, tab tak usase kareedne vaala apana ritern nahin bhar sakegaa
 As soon as this happens, the entire chain will break and the system will know
 is antar ko thik karne ke liye sirf do maheene kaa samay diya gaya he
 If the first dealer did not fill the returns, closed the shop and disappeared, then the same amount of GST you have given to him, you will replenish the same amount
 agar pehle vaale kaa vichaar badal gaya or usne bhar diya to aapako wo rakam waapas mil jaaegi
 Now you will say how do we know that the dealer you are buying the goods from is trustworthy
 to iske liye jiesti kii site par dealron kii reating di jaaegi
 Every trader will be able to see the rating of another trader which will be on the GSTN site
 ab aate hai bill par
 On 1 July you go to your shop
 graahak ko maal bechate hai to pehla jiesti bill kaise kaatenge
 Apart from computer, you can get your bill book printed under GST
 maan lijie ki aap kapadaa vyapaaree hai
 On Saturday, when a customer arrives at your shop and buys 100 shirts, how to make the bill
 kul 15 prakaar kii jaankaree honi chahie aapke paas
 Seller and buyer must have name, address and GSTN number
 bill jari karne kii taarikh, uskaa serial number bhi hona chahie
 You have to enter the description, quantity and total price of the goods
 dealer ke dastakhat anivaary hai
 There will be three copies of each bill
 ek aap rakhenge, doosraa kharidaar ke paas or teesraa transporter ke liye
 You should get it printed
 tippaniyan Every merchant has to bear the cost of printing
 jiesti ke tahat sazaa kaa bhi praavdhaan he
 Are there provisions for arrest under GST
 kya isse choti moti naadaani aapako jail main pahunchaa degi, ye ashanka he yaa vaaki aisa he
 They also try to know
 suresh ji ne hindi main likhaa he ki jiesti kii dhara 69 main giraftaar ke praavdhaan diye gaye hai
 If someone has committed a crime under 132 then one can get arrested
 sijisti adhikari giraftaar karegaa or aadesh ayukta kaa hoga
 Some offenses are non-bailable and some are bailable
 bagaiyr ayukta ke aadesh ke giraftaar nahin ho sakegi
 Will supply goods without bills, with the intention of evading tax
 bina jiesti liye bill jari karne par jail ja sakate hai
 Will not go to jail for three months after taking GST
 agar 2 karod se zyaada kii chori he to giraftaar ke praavdhaan lagu hote hai
 That is, you can avoid going to jail for tax evasion of less than 2 crores
 madhyam or chote shrenee ke dealer ko darane kii zarurat nahin he
 But if you violate GST twice then you can go to jail
 tab yah nahin dekha jayega ki 2 karod kii kar chori kaa aarope he yaa nahin
 0 percent, 5 percent, 12 percent, 18 percent and 28 percent tax are under GST
 aavashyak vastuon ko jiesti se baahar rakhaa gaya he to kai chizein aisi hai jo pehali baar tex ke daayre main aaengi
 Now come to the bill
 1 july ko aap apni dukaan par jate hai
 If you sell goods to the customer then how to deduct the first GST bill
 jiesti ke tahat aap computer ke alaava apni bill book bhi chhapava sakate hai

 com / w3cr5avayf— Hrithik Roshan (@ihrithik)september 20, 2014 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar denied any future alliance with his party JDU with the BJP, saying that whatever the outcome, this chapter is closed forever
 pichley 14 janvari ko bihar vidhanmandal ke sanyukt satr ke dauraan rajyapal divai patil ke abhibhaashan par charchaa ke baad mangalvaar ko sarkaar kii ore se jawaab dene ke kram main nitish ne kaha ki kisi bhi paristhiti main bijepi ke saath bhavishya main koi gathbandhan kaa sawaal hi nahin uthta
 Whatever its consequences
 janamat ke saath vishwasghaat karne ke bijepi ke aarope par nitish ne palatwaar karte hue kaha ki unhone vishwaas nahin todaa, balki bijepi ne gathbandhan ko lekar kiye gaye vaade ko bhuulakar unke saath vishwasghaat kiya
 Nitish claimed that Sushil Kumar Modi, who was the Deputy Chief Minister during the NDA regime, had met another senior BJP leader with the then BJP National President Nitin Gadkari at his residence in Delhi last year and was assured by Gadkari
 unhone kaha ki yahaan tak ki bijepi ke varisht netaa laalkrishna adwani ne bhi unhen aashwaasan diya tha ki modi ko lekar party adhyaksh ke vaayade ko kaayam rakhaa jayega, par aisa nahin hone kii vajah se ve endie se alag hone par majaboor hue
 After the Chief Minister's disclosure, Leader of the Opposition Nandkishore Yadav stood up from his seat and strongly opposed it, saying that he is taking the names of these leaders, while he is not present in the House to present his side
 nandakishor kii aapatti ko darkinar karte hue nitish ne kaha ki desh kaa pradhanmantri kaisaa hona chahie, usko lekar dedh saal purv ek angreji akhbaar main saakshaatkaar main apane vichaar rakh die the
 After ten months, after reading the text written on the wall in the BJP, he decided to break the relationship with her due to his theory
 unhone bijepi ke rashtriya or pradesh ikai ke netaaon ke jediu ke naata tod liye jane par hangaamaa kiye jane ke bare main kaha ki gathbandhan todane kaa nirnay unhone bijepi main atal bihari vaajapeyi ke yug ke ant hone tathaa ek nae yug kii shuruyaat hone ko mahasoos karte hue liya
 Nitish told Nandkishore that if he wishes during this session of the House or on any other day, for that he will request the Speaker of the House and call a special session
 unhone kaha ki avishvaas prastaav laakar unki sarkaar ko gira den, uski unako parvaah nahin he
 The Delhi High Court has ordered the release of Sushil Sharma, convicted of the tandoor scandal
 pichhali sunwaayee main dilli hoicourt nedilli sarkaar se poocha tha ki29 saal kii kaid ke baad bhi abhi tak susheel koreeha kyon nahin kiya gaya he
 Actually, former leader of Youth Congress Sushil burnt the body in Tandoor after killing his wife Naina Sahni in 1995
 56 saal ke ho chuke susheel(sushil Sharma) ne apni yachika main daawa kiya tha ki maafee kii avadhi jod len to vah 29 saal se jail main he
 If removed from the pardon period, he has been in jail for 23 and a half years
 isi aadhaar par usne rihaai kii maang kii thi
 Sushil's petition was rejected by the Sentence Review Board by the Delhi government, after which he filed an application in the Delhi High Court
 aapako bataa den ki purv main dilli ucch nyaayalaypurv yuva congress netaa susheel sharma(sushil Sharma) ko parole par reeha karne ke uske adeshon kaa anupaalan nahin karne ke liye police ko aade haathon le chukaa he
 Justice Siddharth Mridul expressed displeasure over the stand of the jail authorities that Sharma was not released from the jail despite court orders
 adaalat ne uparajyapal ke vishesh karyaadhikari (oesady) ajay choudhary ko adaalat main pesh hone or is baat kii safai dene ko kaha tha ki adaalat ke aadesh kaa anupaalan kyon nahin hua

 shivasena kaa kahana he ki pradhanmantri kii kursi par daawa thokane se pehle sharad pavaar ko bayaan dene se pehle home work karne kii aadat daal leni chahie
 a few days ago, Sharad Pawar had made a comment against the Sangh, saying that there were no blasts in the country since the arrest of the accused in the Malegaon bomb blasts
 shivasena kii ye pratikriya pavaar ke isi bayaan par ai he
 Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut said in Thane that the terror attacks in Mumbai occurred after the arrest of the accused in the Malegaon bomb blasts
 pradhanmantri pad kii daavedaari karne se pehle pavaar ko ye baat dhyaan main rakh kar bayaan dena chahie tha
 The Union Home Minister put everything that is the policy of the current government on Pakistan from the statement "it is a neighbor that does not agree"
 yaa phir kahen ek uljhi hui niti, jisamen kabhi naram to kabhi garam maahaul hota he
 Many officials, who are well aware of the ever-changing relationship between India and Pakistan, say that since this government has come, the direction of foreign policy towards Pakistan is not being known
 ek varisht adhikari ne enditivi india ko bataaya ki "grih mantri kaa yah bayaan bahut kuch bataata he
 This remark is especially for the Prime Minister, who left Pakistan suddenly and after that he assured everyone that Pakistan is helping India
 " According to him, the treatment done to the Home Minister in Pakistan was very bad
 lekin phir bhi unhone sanyam se kadam uthaae
 North Block is of the opinion that "pakistan has never treated any minister of India so badly, but since our foreign policy is not fixed only, it has also been instigated
" " Actually, the central government does not understand how to engage Pakistan
 pichley kuch maheenon se centre sarkaar lagaataar koshish main lagi hui thi ki vah pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa pakistan kaa daura jastiphai kare, pathankot hamale ke baad bhi
 An official says that "pakistan's team was escorted to the air base in India but Pakistan has not yet approved the nia's departure
" " Not only this, everything is known in Kashmir
 pakistan ne kashmir main maare gaye logon ke liye kaala diwas tak manaaya
 An official sitting in Raisina Hills says that "pakistan has taken a hard stand towards India in the last few months but still we could not say anything

 One officer estimates that "modi suddenly left for Pakistan at the behest of Nawaz Sharif"
 lekin grih mantri saarc sammelan main gaye, vahaan apni naaraazgi darj karai or khari-khoti bhi suna aae
 "in such a situation, Rajnath's height has increased

 ab bazaar main maujuuda str par kuch munafavsuli dekhne ko mil sakati he
 Especially on behalf of the investors who had invested in the market in view of the election results

 The asset quality of banks has also improved, so in the coming days, there may be good opportunities for investment in the banking sector
 ham maanate hai ki in sudhaaron ke saath hi rupye main majbootee dekhne ko milegi or bond yield main bhi sudhaar aayega
 Due to the strength of the rupee, the performance of IT and the forma sector will not be good
 iske alaava emmemasiji companiyon main bhi ucch valuation ke kaaran munafavsuli sambhav he
 Government securities can be a good investment option

 This is because of their attractive valuations relative to large companies

 Apart from this, like the new government will advance its reform agenda, it will give new dimensions to growth in the economy, which will also prove to be good for the stock market

 Kuldeep was going to take this with the child pakade jane par kuldeep ne police ko sachai banyaa kar di
 The moral relatives of the child are not tired of praising the Delhi Police for safe guarding the child
 madhu vihaar thane ke inspector ke
 P
 shah jaise hi apni team ke saath bachche ko lekar aae logon ne unki jai jayakaar shuru kar di
 On the recovery of the child in the house, the mother distributed sweets

 In Delhi, the women's commission team along with the police has rescued 39 Nepali girls from a hotel in Paharganj area
 haftebhar ke bheetar teesri baar ayog kii team ne police ke saath milakar aisa oparation anjaam diya he
 a total of 73 girls have been rescued this week
 beeti raat dilli mahila ayog kii team police ke saath milakar ek soochna ke aadhaar par pahadganj ke hotel main red ke liye pahunchi
 It was reported that Nepalese girls have been brought here for the last few days, who are preparing to be sent to other countries
 jab mahila ayog kii team ne hotel main pahunch kar ricards khangale or talaashi lee to unako vahaan se 39 nepali ladkiyaan baraamad hui
 Those who were taken directly to Paharganj Police Station
 hotel karmchaaree ne bataaya ki ye ladkiyaan 15 dinon se yaheen rukii hui thi, sabhi ne apane pahchaan ke taur par nepal kaa passport diya tha or lagaataar hotel se aa ja rahi thim
 Delhi Police is investigating the matter and medical checkup of the girls is being done
 kyonki mahila ayog kii team kaa kahana tha ki ladakiyon se yahaan veshyavriti karai ja rahi thi
 He was also being sexually assaulted
 mahila ayog ke mutabik 5 din pehle dilli kii muniraka se, kal maidangadhi se or mangalvaar kii raat pahadganj main red daali gai he
 In which a total of 73 girls have gone to Coruscuca
 ayog kii adhyaksh swati maliwal ne aarope lagaaya ki in sabhi ladakiyon ko khadi deshon main bechaa janaa tha
 Such cases are coming up on the day in Delhi, which is surprising
 police is baat kii chaanbin kar rahi he ki ye ladkiyaan kisi racket kaa hissaa hai yaa phir iske peeche koi or sajeesh he
 For the last 25 years, Sachin and the fanatics of Indian cricket have been celebrating the birthday of the master-blaster as if he were celebrating his own birthday
 is din sachin ke kek kaatane kii tasveeron kaa media ko bhi intazaar hota tha or aam phens ko bhi
 Fans also celebrated their birthday as soon as Sachin's cake was cut
 sachin aaj apana 42waan jandin manaa rahe hai par phens kii umiden ab bhi waisi hi hai
 When he was going to the ground with his bat and in the hope of getting a century from him, "sachin
" 
 
 
 "sachin"
 sachin tab 120 karod phens kii awaazon kaa bakhubi maan rakhte or in phens kaa seenaa garv se chaudaa ho jaataa
 On November 16, 2013, Sachin and his fans were moistened while saying goodbye to the cricket ground, but at the same time there was a question between Sachin and his fans that what he would be seen doing next
 pichley kareeb 16-17 maheenon main sachin ne cricket ke maidan ke bahaar se hi bhartiya khelon ke liye khub ballebaazi kii
 During the Asian Games held in Incheon, the issue of life-long management on female boxer Sarita Devi was standing in front
 ye masala sulajhaa or is vajah se ab sarita devi rio olympix kii taiyaari ke liye ab jor laga rahi hai to uski badi vajah sachin kii koshishen hai
 During this period, Sachin remained the brand ambassador of ICC World Cup cricket and also kept favoring the associate members
 unka maananaa he ki 25 deshon ko cricket khilne kaa mauka diya janaa chahie, tabhi cricket kii lokapriyata duniyabar main failegi or isisi ke associat sadasyon ke saath nyaay bhi ho paaegaa
 Sachin's direct connection to cricket is now seen during IPL matches when he is seen fixing the technique of young players and devising strategies for Mumbai Indians
 sachin ne bhartiya khel mantralay ko sabhi khelon ko trek par laane kaa rodmap bhi diya he
 The comments ye bhi tay he ki sachin apni raftaar chaahe jaisi bhi rakhen, bhartiya khel tantra kii bhi apni ek raftaar he or in donon ke bich bada faasla he
 But how do fans give up their hopes? His hero is Sachin
 kareeb dhai dashak tak sachin sabaki umeedo par khara utre hai
 Everyone's hopes in his second innings have increased from him
 master blaster ko duniyabar se janmdin ke maukey par badhai sandesh aa rahe hai, aap bha badhai den
 On the occasion of his birthday, # happybirthdaysachin is running on the social networking site Twitter
 badhai sandeshon main se kuch chuninda ye hai

 com / mujy36w5kp — Suresh Raina (@imraina) April 23, 2015 Sachin is celebrating his 42nd birthday today, but the hopes of the fans are still the same
 jab wo balla lekar maidan par ja rahe hote or unase centuri kii ummid main phens "sachin
 
 
 
 sachin" ke naare laga rahe hote
 Sachin would then respect the voices of 120 crores fans and the chest of these fans would be widened with pride
 16 navambar, 2013 ko cricket ke maidan ko alavida kehete vaqt sachin or unke phens kii ankhen nam ho gai thim, lekin saath hi saath sachin or unke prashansakon ke bich ye sawaal bhi khadaa ho gaya tha ki aage wo kya karte nazar aaenge
 In the last about 16–17 months, Sachin batted a lot for the Indian Games from outside the cricket field
 inchion main hue asian khelon ke dauraan mahila mukkebaaz sarita devi par aaajeevan prabandh lagaae jane kaa masalaa saamne khadaa tha
 This spice has been solved and due to this, now Sarita Devi is now pushing for the preparation of Rio Olympics, then the big reason is Sachin's efforts
 sachin is dauraan isisi world cap cricket ke brands ambesder rahete hue bhi associat sadasyon kii tarafdaari karte rahe
 He believes that 25 countries should be given a chance to play cricket, only then the popularity of cricket will spread worldwide and justice will also be done to the associate members of the ICC
 sachin kaa sidhe cricket se vaasta ab ipel ke maichon ke dauraan nazar aata he jab wo yuva khiladiyon kii takanic ko thik karte or mumbai indiens kii ranneetiyaan taiyaar karte dikhaai de jate hai
 Sachin has also given a roadmap to the Indian Sports Ministry to get all sports on track
 tippaniyan It is also certain that whatever the pace Sachin should keep his pace, the Indian sports system also has its own pace and there is a big gap between them
 magar phens apni ummid kaise choden? unka hero sachin hai
 For almost two and a half decades, Sachin has lived up to everyone's expectations
 unki duusari pari main sabaki ummiden unase or bad gai hai
 Master Blaster is receiving congratulatory messages from all over the world on his birthday, congratulations to you
 unke berthde ke maukey par soshal netwarking site twitor par # happybirthdaysachin chal rahaa he

 Ashok Gehlot will demand for 9 months of his work, voting on October 21 for 2 seats in the Legislative Assembly, the by-election in two seats in Rajasthan is a big challenge for Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot
 ek taraf bijepi dhara 370 or rashtrawaad ke mudde par aatmavishvaas se labarej hai to duusari taraf ashok gahalot ko apane 9 maheene ke kaamkaaj par vot maangana he
 This time too, Ashok Gehlot missed Sachin, there is a possibility of lifting the head of the pilot
 rajasthan main vidhansabha kii 2 siton ke liye 21 oktober ko vot daalaa janaa he
 Of these, Narendra Khichad, who was MLA from Mandawa seat, has become MP from BJP in Jhunjhunu Lok Sabha seat
 duusari taraf khinvsar seat se vidhayak hanuman beniwal nagaur se endie ummidavaar ke rup main rashtriya loktantric party ke saansad ban gaye hai
 The Lok Sabha election was no less of a nightmare for the Congress, which had won the assembly elections, in which it lost 25 of the 25 seats
 us vakt mukhyamantri ashok gahalot deshbhar main modi lahar hone ke bahaane se batch gaye the lekin is baar upachunaav main inhen apane 9 maheene ke kaamkaaj kaa byora dena he
 Ashok Gehlot is saying that the preparations are complete and we will contest the elections with Deputy Chief Minister Sachin Pilot on the organization
 vidhansabha chunaav main mandava seat congress 2300 voton se haari thi
 Therefore, it is expected that the Congress will repeat the last time candidate Rita Chaudhary, while it will not be easy for BJP to find candidates there
 is seat se saansad bane narendra kheechad do baar vidhayak rahe hai

 In the state, BJP has appointed Satish Poonia as the President of Rajasthan BJP
 pichley 20 saalon main pehali baar aisa ho rahaa he ki vasundhara raaje ke bina bijepi rajya main chunaav main ja rahi he
 In such a situation, it has to be seen how the BJP is able to show its strength without Vasundhara
 yah chunaav vasundhara virdohi gut ke liye bhi litmus test hoga or satish punia ko bhi yah sabit karnaa hoga ki rajya main vah bijepi ko aage lekar ja sakate hai
 a major headache for the BJP is also the National Democratic Party, the constituent of the NDA
 jiskaa kahana he ki khinvsar seat par uskaa haq he or samjhaute ke tahat use milanaa chahie
 Hanuman Beniwal has a great influence on the Jat vote bank
 aise me bijepi chaahegi ki hanuman beniwal kaa istemaal jat bahul mandava seat par bhi ho
 But Vasundhara Raje's camp is wishing that there should be no compromise with Hanuman Beniwal's party

 ek geet jo aam aadmi party or anna andolan ke liye tagaline ban gaya, wo he- bichade sab baari baari
 In fact, when the coin of the Kejriwal started running in the party calling for conflict, gradually all those people who have ever questioned Kejriwal were sidelined
 yahi vajah he ki anna andolan ke dauraan kejariwal ko chhodkar justise santosh hegade se lekar kiran bedi tak chali gayi to aam aadmi party se shajia ilmi, prashanth bhushan or yogendra yadav jaise netaa alag ho gaye
 The rottenness of internal fighting in Kejriwal's party would have remained buried under the carpet, if the MCD had not lost

 Therefore, even the few elected councilors had to repeatedly plead with sincerity
 kejariwal ke sapane or aadarshon par bada sawaal to khud unke kabhi kareebi rahe kumaar vishwaas ne laga diya he
 Kejriwal calls his party pure and honest, but Kumar Vishwas is convinced that the AAP has now become Congress, in the case of corruption
 ab ye saaf nahin he ki ye kumaar vishwaas kii bhadaas he yaa vaaki dil se niklaa party ke liye dard, lekin haare hue kejariwal ke ghaavon par kumaar vishwaas ke ek-ek shabd namak-mirch kii tarah chubhe honge
 Amidst all this, when the party's MLA Amanatullah Khan described Kumar Vishwas as an agent of RSS and BJP, the party's arrogance came to the fore
 jaise-taisekumar vishwasako kejariwal ne manaa liya lekin party main bharose kii kami to badhati hi gai, or isaki shuruyaat tabhi ho gai thi jab kejariwal ko dilli main 70 main se 67 siten mili thi
 After the victory, Kejriwal threw out the founding legends like Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan from the party in one jolt
 darasal kejariwal ko jisase ratti bhar dikkat hui yaa jisane bhi kejariwal ne netritv par inch bhar bhi ungali uthaai, usko kejariwal baahar karte gaye
 To know this, you have to go back a bit in history
 2011 main bhrashtachar ke khilaaf andolan kii aguai bhale hi anna hajaare kar rahe the
 But all his planning was done by Arvind Kejriwal
 us dauraan andolan main jisase bhi kejariwal kii nahin bani, unako baahar kaa rasta dikhaa diya gaya yaa phir un logon ne hi apana rasta alag kar liya, chaahe swami agnivesh hon yaa justise santosh hegade yaa aam aadmi party ke sansthaapak sadsy shanti bhushan
 And later Shazia walked out of AAP till Ilmi, who once considered Kejriwal to be the most honest, today is the most corrupt
 party ke kai diggaj or saaf-suthri chhavi ke netaa baahar chalate gaye or jo bache, unamem kai mantriyon par sangeen aarope bhi lage
 Sandeep Kumar, a minister in the Kejriwal government, had to resign after the sex CD arrived
 - kejariwal ke ek or mantri aasim khan ko bilderon se vasuuli ke aarope main kursi ganvaani padi
 On the charge of bus scam, Gopal Rai was taken to Transport Department and given to Satyendra Jain
 - kejariwal sarkaar main kanoon mantri rahe jitendra tomars ko farji degree ke aarope main kursi ganvaani padi or jail bhi janaa padaa
 - Abkapil Mishraco was removed for not working in the department

 In the day-to-day violence, where there is a panic atmosphere in the area, the fearless miscreants are so strong that they are blaming the claims of service security of Gurgaon Police

 bijepi ne is baar badi sankhya main apane maujuuda saansadon ke tikat kaate hai
 This has been done to reduce the anger against these mps in their constituencies
 bijepi abhi tak 437 ummidavaaron kaa elaan kar chuki he
 It currently has 270 mps in the Lok Sabha
 inamen se 102 saansadon ko dobaaraa tikat nahin diya gaya he
 That is, about 38 percent of mps' tickets have been cut
 bijepi ne badi sankhya main tikat kaatane kaa formula narendra modi ke gujarat kaa mukhyamantri rahete hue vahaan ke vidhansabha chunaavon main istemaal kiya tha
 The party also benefited from this
 yahi vajah he ki is formule ko ab lok sabha main bhi lagu kiya gaya he
 BJP has cut the tickets of all ten sitting mps in Chhattisgarh
 iske alaava uttar pradesh main bhi badi sankhya main saansadon ke tikat kaate gaye hai
 Many mps in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Maharashtra have not got a chance again
 inamen laal krishna adwani, murali manohar joshi, shanta kumaar, sumitra mahajan, bisi khanduri, calraj mishra jaise ve diggaj netaa bhi shaamil hai jinhen 75 varsh kii umr puri hone ke kaaran bijepi ne dobaaraa tikat nahin diya he
 Congress is also not behind in doing this
 congress ke haalanki saansad kam hai
 Yet it has not renominated 16 of its mps
 yani kareeb 33 pratishat congress saansadon ko dobaaraa mauka nahin mil sakaa he
 The data collected with the help of Ashoka University has shown that if we talk about new candidates, BJP has given a chance to 243 new candidates
 jabaki congress ne 304 nae ummidavaar maidan main utaare hai
 However, there is a similarity in the way both parties cut tickets
 donon hi rashtriya partiyon ne satta virdohi lahar ko kam karne ke liye gaaj anusuchit jati or janajati ke saansadon par zyada giraayi he
 The BJP has 63 reserved class mps in the current Lok Sabha
 inamen se 33 saansadon ko dobaaraa mauka nahin diya gaya he
 That is, more than 52 percent Dalit tribal mps have not been able to get the ticket again
 jabaki saamaanya varg ke 33 pratishat se adhik saansadon ke hi tikat kaate gaye hai
 The BJP has cut tickets for 69 mps from the general category and 33 mps from the reserved category
 congress ne bhi aisa hi kiya he
 The Congress has seven mps from the reserved category, out of which three have not been fielded
 yah aankada kareeb 43 pratishat he
 While the Congress has cut tickets for 23 percent of general category mps
 congress ne saamaanya varg ke 13 jabaki arakshit varg ke teen saansadon ke tikat kaate hai

 VIDEO: Ranatunga has been raising questions even before jodhpur jail main jaj madhusudan sharma ne jab faisla sunaate hue asaram ko doshi qaraar diya to uskaa cheharaa utar gaya
 After a few moments of calm, he started chanting the name of Ram and then suddenly he started laughing in a dramatic way
 iske baad usne jaj se raham kii guhaar bhi lagaai
 Then Asaram put his hands on the lawyers' shoulder and said - Say something
 iske baad jab jaj ne asaram ko umrakaid kii sajaa sunai to vah adaalat main hi ro padaa
 Asaram Bapuko was convicted by a Jodhpur court in a 5-year-old sexual abuse case
 suraksha kaarnon se jail main hi court lagaai gai
 Judge Madhusudan was hearing the case
 vah subah tay vakt par adaalat pahunche or aropiyon ko talab kiya
 After all the accused arrived, the judge summoned Asaram
 wo vahaan nahin tha
 The court proceedings had started, so Judge Madhusudan Sharma asked to bring Asaram and was told that he was worshiping
 phir vah 15 minute baad jaj ke saamne pahunchaa
 Asaram's lawyer then told the judge that he wanted to say something in front of him
 is par jaj sharma ne vakil ko kaha ki ab kuch nahin sunanaa he
 The case hearing has been completed
 ab nirnay kaa samay he
 After this, Judge Sharma typed about two pages from his stano
 kuch der baad unhone faisla sunaate hue asaram ko doshi qaraar de diya
 Shilpi and Sharatchand along with Asaram were also convicted by the judge
 lekin shiva or prakaash kii kam umr kaa hawala dete hue jaj ne unhen bari kar diya
 Asaram's face came off as soon as he heard the verdict
 vah kaaphi maayoos dikh rahaa tha
 He started chanting the name of Ram
 or kuch der baad vah hansane laga
 Meanwhile, the court started further action
 sarkari vakeelon ne asaram ko kadi sajaa die jane ko lekar daleelein dena shuru kiya or sajaa par bahes hone lagi
 Meanwhile, after hearing the verdict, Asaram told the judge that he had become old
 us par raham kiya jaae
 But the judge did not react to his words
 jodhpur jail main banaai gai vishesh court main asaram kii taraf se vakeelon kii fouj maujuud thi
 There were 14 lawyers present in the court to defend him
 anna hajaare pichley kaaphi samay se jansamarthan kaa abhaav jhel rahe hai
 Especially at his rallies
 2011 ke ramlila andolan main lakhon log pahunche the
 Now they talk of the arrival of five thousand people and even a thousand people do not reach
 bhoomi adhigrahan bill ke virodh main anna phir dilli main hai
 Last night at Maharashtra Bhavan, the strategy was how to bring Anna and Kejriwal to the stage together
 taaki is jodi kaa teen saal purana rutaba lautaaya ja sake
 But now it is not possible -1
 anna or kejariwal ek-duusare ke virodh main kaaphi kuch kah chuke hai:india against karpshan ke sahyogi anna hajaare or arvind kejariwal main ek buniyadi virodh he
 The protest came on 20 September 2012 when Kejriwal quoted a poll saying that 76 percent of his supporters wanted him to contest the election
 anna ne iskaa virodh karte hue kaha ki chunaav ladane ke liye paison kii jarurat hoti he or iske liye mulyon se samjhauta karnaa padataa he
 If Kejriwal remained adamant, Anna even went so far as to tell him to stop using my name and my photo
 jab anna ne upie sarkaar dwaara sansad main pesh lokapal bill ke saath sahmati jataai to kejariwal ne talkh shabdon main twit kiya ki 'anna sarkari jokapaal se kaise sahamat ho gaye
 Interestingly, both Congress and BJP agree with this'
 2
 Kejriwal is no longer non-political: Anna Hazare did not get tired of praising Kejriwal during the Jan Lokpal movement
 kejariwal kisi party se nahin jude hai
 Leaving a large government job, have come to the country service
 chappal or saadhaaran shart-pant pahante hai
 But when Kejriwal formed the Aam Aadmi Party, Anna stopped speaking about Kejriwal
 kuch dinon baad donon ke bich aarope-pratyarope kisi aam netaaon jaise hone lage
 Anna was left behind and Kejriwal fell into politics
 ab ye duuri khatm hona naammumkin he
 3
 gaiyr-raajnneetik logon kii dilchaspee kam ho gai he:2011 ke bhrashtachar virdohi andolan main desh ke kone-kone se aam logon or sansthaaon ne team anna ko apana samarthan diya tha
 Millions of people reached the Ramlila ground in support of Anna
 lekin jaise hi is team main bikharaav hua or kejariwal or unki team ne raajnneetik party banaai, aam logon kaa is andolan se hi bharosa uth gaya
 Meanwhile, Anna started a fast on the issue of corruption near the bandra-kurla Complex in Mumbai
 50 hajaar logon ke aane kaa daawa kiya gaya, lekin paanch hajaar log bhi nahin pahunche
 He tried to re-establish the movement in Delhi, but this attempt was also unsuccessful
 4
 Anna may fight across, but Kejriwal no longer: The issue of land acquisition is a national issue, especially with farmers
 anna chunki gaanv se jude hue hai, isliye ve is par majbootee se paksh rakh sakate hai
 But Kejriwal's case is now second
 haal hi main unhen dilli kii janata ne rajya ke mukhiya ke taur par chunaa he
 The issue of land acquisition is not very much connected to the people of Delhi
 aise main kejariwal is maamle main bahut zyada sangharsh nahin kar paaenge
 They will connect with Anna in a symbolic way
 5
 The issue of land acquisition did not become as widespread as the issue of corruption: the support that Team Anna received in 2011 is now difficult to get
 kyonki tab desh main ek ke baad ek ghotaale saamne aa rahe the
 Adarsh scam, 2G scam, coal scam, Commonwealth scam etc
 aam logon main gussa tha
 Anna gave the stage to that anger
 ve janalokapal ke rup main ek samaadhaan bhi lekar aae
 In which strict measures were suggested for action on corrupt people
 lekin bhoomi adhigrahan bill ke maamle main zyaadaatar aabaadi ko pataa hi nahin he
 And she is not even directly attached to him
 phir anna yaa kejariwal kya chaahate hai, ye bhi spasht nahin he
 In such a situation, public support is expected to be limited
 in tamaam baton ke baavjood anna or kejariwal phir saath aa rahe hai
 Anna has given consent to the Aam Aadmi Party to join this movement
 anna or bhoomi adhigrahan kaa mudda kejariwal ko unki rashtriya vistaar main madad hi denge

 The government has introduced a VAT amendment in the Delhi Assembly, according to which now the cabinet has given the right to take the decision to increase or decrease the VAT rate over 11 products
 yani in utpaada par waite kitna ho ye nirnay lene ke liye sarkaar ko vidhansabha main aane kii zarurat nahin hogi
 The 11 items in this list include petrol, candles, liquor, clock above five thousand, cold drinks, lottery tickets, tobacco and gutkha
 in sabhi par abhi waite kii adhiktam seemaa 20 fisadi he
 This means that the government can levy VAT at the rate of 20 per cent on these goods at the moment
 lekin sarkaar ab cabinet ke zariye kabhi bhi isko 30 fisadi tak karne kaa faisla lene ke liye adhikrut ho gayi
 Leader of the Opposition in Delhi Legislative Assembly Vijendra Gupta said that the government was contradicting its own stand and lying by talking double
 gupta ke mutabiq sarkaar ne bajet main kaha tha ki waite kii dar nahin badhengi or ab sarkaar ye badha rahi he or ham isaki ninda karte hai
 Delhi Deputy CM and Finance Minister Manish Sisodia said that there is no proposal to increase inflation or increase VAT, it is being done only to make the rate of VAT flexible and any rate increase or reduction will be done after the whole study, Currently there is no proposal to increase VAT
 tippaniyan In fact, the Delhi government had held a meeting recently with 4 more states Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Punjab and Himachal Pradesh and agreed that the VAT rate should be the same in all these states
 yani is act main badlaav se sarkaar baaki ke rajyon ke saath talmail baitaane ke liye kabhi bhi bas ek cabinet kii baithak karke waite gata yaa badha sakati he, baar-baar vidhansabha aane kii zarurat nahin
 But in this, the people of Delhi may have doubts on whether VAT rates can be increased? Because Delhi government has 70% of the total income from VAT and the Delhi government has targeted that last year, where it got VAT of Rs 17000 crore, now the target has been increased to Rs 24000 crore
 jo 11 saamaan is list main hai unamem petrol, mombatti, sharaab, paanch hazaar se upar kii ghadi, cold drink, lottery tikat, tambaaku or gutkha hai
 All these currently have a maximum VAT limit of 20 per cent
 iskaa matlab he ki sarkaar philhal in saamaanon par zyada se zyada 20 fisadi kii dar se waite lag saktaa he
 But now the government has been authorized to take the decision of increasing it to 30 percent anytime through the cabinet
 dilli vidhansabha main vipaksh ke netaa vijendra gupta ne kaha ki sarkaar apni hi baat main virodhabhas kar rahi he or dohari baat karke jhooth bol rahi he
 According to Gupta, the government had said in the budget that the rate of VAT will not increase and now the government is increasing it and we condemn it
 dilli ke dipti siem or vitt mantri manish sisodiya ne kaha ki mahangaai badhane yaa waite badhane kaa prastaav nahin he, ye keval waite ke rate ko lacheela banane ke liye kiya ja rahaa he or koi bhi rate main badhotaree yaa katautee puri study ke baad hogi, abhi waite badhaane kaa koi prastaav nahin he
 The comments asal main dilli sarkaar ne pichley dinon 4 or rajyon uttar pradesh, haryana, punjab or himachal pradesh ke saath baithak karke is baat par sahmati banaayi thi ki in sabhi rajyon main waite kii dar ek saamaan ho
 That is, with the change in this act, the government can reduce or increase VAT by simply meeting a cabinet to keep pace with the rest of the states, no need to come to the assembly again and again
 lekin isamen dilli waalon ko shankaa isi baat par ho sakati he ki kya waite ke rate bad sakate hai? kyonki dilli sarkaar ke paas kul aamadani kaa 70 fisadi waite se aata he or dilli sarkaar ne lakshya rakhaa he ki pichley saal jahaan 17000 karod rupee usko waite mila tha abaki baar lakshya badhaakar 24000 karod rupee rakhaa gaya he

 kashmiri algaavvaad jis vakt apane shikhar par pahunchaa, main itnaa purana, varisht or (afsos ke saath, lekin aprihaary rup se) itnaa sampadak-numa ho chukaa tha ki baahar jaakar report karne kii jahamat uthaa paata
 Even after all this, if i agree to enter the storm from Vishal Bhardwaj's film Haider, then it is as much respect for the mainstream of India's mature political cinema as respecting the growing maturity of the people of the country
 soshal media par haidar ke boycott kaa jabardast abhiyaan chhidaa hua he or use tamaam kism kii badtareen chizon ke liye doshi tehraaya ja rahaa he—bharat-virdohi, sena-virdohi, hindu-virdohi, or isse bhi badhkar, bhagwaan shiv-virdohi (film main ek pramukh nrity puraane martand mandir ke khandhiron main filmaaya gaya he)

 i am saying this because just a year ago, another important political film Madras Cafe also garnered both commercial success and critical acclaim
 yah film, haidar se bhi zyada, srilanka main bhartiya sena or khufia tantra kii naakaami kii kahani thi
 Of course there were some protests against it in Tamil Nadu, but it performed better than any other political film of its genre, without giving the truth its shape or border

 This reinforced the belief that the defeat of the Indian leaders and the betrayal of China was not responsible for that defeat
 yah mithkeey vishwaas aaj teen peedhishon baad bhi kaayam he or yahi vajah he ki koi bhi sarkaar henderson brooks-bhagat report ko ujagar karnaa nahin chaahati
 On the other hand, Dutta's much-vaunted film Border has introduced a completely new fiction and that the Indian army has complete mastery over the Pakistani army
 yah galp iske fouran baad ghatane vaale pokaran-2 or kargil se upje josho-kharosh ke saath bakhubi mail khaataa tha
 After this, there was a flood of so-called war films in which either Deol or a similar character was shattering stupid Pakistanis
 yah silsilaa tab tak chalata rahaa jab tak ki hindustani darshak ub nahin gaye or kargil ke baad banane vaali harek film buree tarah flop nahin ho gai
 One reason for this was that by now people had seen the 'film' on television news channels, adorned with the role of real soldiers

 Also see how different government agencies look at a militant — from the army chief who orders a Kashmiri doctor to attack the house instead of attacking it because 'any militant, alive or dead, Nothing is more valuable than my soldier's sacrifice ', even to the policeman who shoots three suspects because the price of a' dead militant 'is also Rs 1 lakh

 Rather than discrediting the army, Haider casts a fair light on its role

 One evening at a secluded outpost, Ned asked the commander how he understood his troops on the Indian side
 kya ve dushman ke prachaar or kashmiri bair se gumraah nahin hote? adhikari ne kaha, mujhse mat pucho, mere sainikon se pucho
 So we asked the soldiers

 2
 grahan ke vakt pahane kapadon ko kisi garib ko daan de dena chahie
 3
 snaan karne ke baad hi puja ghar main pravesh karen
 4
 chandragrahan khatm hone ke baadaghar main sthit devataaon kii sabhi murtiyon par gangaajal chhidakkar shuddh karen
 5

 6
 iske alaava apane pitaron ko yaad karen or unke naam par garibon ko daan den
 7
 agar aapke ghar ke paas koi mandir he to vahaan par jaakar puja paath karen
 8
 aise hi agar aapke ghar ke paas koi ghat ho to vahaan jaakar shiv ji kii puja karen
 This will reduce the effect of negative energy

 Apart from this, if there is a basil plant in your house, after the eclipse is over, purify it by spraying Ganga water

 On the occasion of Deepawali, the festival of lights, this time the leaders have completely defeated the actors
 raajnneeti ke akhaade main jor-aajamaaish karne vaale in rajanetaaon kii pratidwandvita deepawali ke is khaas maukey par bhi najar aa rahi he
 Rockets made in the name of Narendra Modi, who has become the face of the BJP, are being sold, while the sparklers being sold in the name of Priyanka Vadra, daughter of Congress President Sonia Gandhi, are also the center of attraction
 soobe ke alag-alag shaharon ke bazaaron main netaaon kii photo vaale pataakhon kii bharmaar he
 The buyers of firecrackers are also looking at adding a copy of firecrackers to the behavior of politicians
 agar bazaar main modi, sonia or laalkrishna adwani ke naam se rocket bik rahe hai, to mulaayam singh yadav va rahul gandhi ke naam vaale anaar kii bhi khub kharidari ho rahi he
 Shopkeepers say that the demand for the rocket bearing the photo of Modi, the prime ministerial candidate of the BJP, is the highest
 modi ke baad sonia rocket va priyanka phuljhadi bik rahi hai
 The public is not particularly interested in other leaders
 har baar kii apeksha is baar deepawali ke maukey par pataakhon main bollywood ke abhinayta, abhinetriyon kii tulana main rajanetaaon kii tasviren zyada dikhaai de rahi hai
 Those selling firecrackers are also expected to sell goods with the help of politicians
 pataakhon ke thok vikreta sabir ali kehete hai ki chunavi mausam main pataakhaa bazaar bhi usee rang main range hue hai
 Buyers are taking firecrackers bearing the picture of the leader of their choice
 bachche, yuvaaon va bujurgon, sabhi kii pasand modi rocket bana he
 This time the firecracker market is less attractive than every time
 pataakhon kii dukaane tarah-tarah ke anaar, phuljhadi, bam, chakri se saji hai, lekin unhen kharidne ke liye har baar kii apeksha bheed kam he
 According to Civil Lines shopkeeper Rajesh Sharma, this time the crowd of children is very less, this has affected their sales

 The speech of Congress President Rahul Gandhi, given during the discussion in Parliament on the motion of no confidence against the Modi government, remains the subject of discussion
 apane bhaashan main congress adhyaksh ne jahaan modi sarkaar kii naakaamiyaan ginaayin, vahiin bijepi kii taraf se hone vaale vyaktigat hamalon kaa bhi jawaab diya
 Not only this, Rahul Gandhi looked very aggressive in the House on Friday
 unhone satta paksh ko unheen ke andaaj main gherne kii koshish kii
 Even to explain what it means to be a Hindu, he went to PM Modi and hugged him
 lekin iske baad wo apni seat par aakar baithe or apane kisi sahyogi saansad kii taraf dekhakar aankh maari to wo tasviir rahul ke puure bhaashan par jaise pani pher gai
 After which different reactions are coming to his style
 bijepi netaa rahul ke is andaaj kii jamkar aalochana kar rahe hai
 Even Lok Sabha speaker Sumitra Mahajan has denied this attitude
 lekin kya aisa karke rahul sadan main koi galati kar baithe? yaa phir yah unki us raajnneetik aparipakvata kaa namoona kaha jaae, jiske bare main bijepi netaa aksar bayaan dete rahe hai
 At present, this attitude of Rahul is being judged in different ways, but if we go in the past, it is known that Rahul has been seen in such a style before
 2014 loksabhaa chunaavamein congress ko buree haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa or vah mahaj 44 siton par simatakar rah gai
 On the other hand in the Modi wave, BJP won an absolute majority for the first time in its history and under the leadership of Narendra Modi, the party formed the government at the Center

 Standing next to Sonia, Rahul was the first person Rahul Gandhi gave his statement in this press conference
 unke baad sonia gandhi ne apni baat rakhi or rahul gandhi unki bain taraf khadey ho gaye
 During this time, when Sonia Gandhi was giving his statement, in the meantime Rahul Gandhi started looking at the media persons standing in front of him
 ye thik waisi hi tasviir thi, jaisi 20 july ko sansad main avishvaas prastaav par charchaa ke dauraan dekhne ko mili he

 Ever since India stormed into Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, many people have been congratulating the brave stars of the Indian Air Force, who have carried out this action

 shahar main particulet matter piem 2
 The 5 and PM10 levels were the highest and the air quality in the entire city was in the "worrying" category
 haalanki, tatkaal iske kaarnon kaa andaja nahin lagaaya ja saktaa lekin visheshgyon ke anusaar khule main biomas ko jalaaye jane or thand se raahat paane ke liye sookhe patton ko jalaane se puure ilaake main particulet matter ke str main bahut adhik vruddhi hui he
 The city’s air quality was in ‘worrisome’ condition since Diwali but a gradual decrease in pollutants was recorded earlier this month

 5 kaa ausat str 295 microgram prati ghan meter or piem 10 kaa ausat str 470 microgram prati ghan meter rahaa jo chintajanak str he

 However, the reasons for this cannot be immediately ascertained but according to experts the burning of biomass in the open and the burning of dry leaves to relieve the cold has greatly increased the level of Particulate Matter in the whole area

 The BJP may have won the Gujarat Assembly elections, but its fewer seats than in the previous elections have raised alarm bells for the party
 bijepi ko rajya main sabase bada jhatka saurashtra main laga he, jise bijepi kaa durg kaha jaataa he
 The party has lost 12 seats in the region compared to the previous elections
 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav ko dekhte hue bijepi abhi se apana ye kila durust karne main jute gai he
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, BJP won all 26 seats in Gujarat
 aise main bijepi ke paas paane ke liye kuch nahin he, lekin ganvaane ke liye puraa rajya padaa he
 Saurashtra is a strong stronghold of farmers
 bijepi ko kisaanon kii naaraazgi kaa khamiyaja vidhansabha chunaav main uthaanaa padaa he
 Patidar leader Hardik Patel has been besieging the BJP by raising the issue of farmers not only demanding reservation for their community
 aise main bijepi ne saurashtra ke kisaanon kii naaraazgi ko dur karne ke liye rajya kii krishi niti kii samiksha shuru kar di he
 BJP remembers Kisan Saurashtra, the party has started working at its level in the constituencies where the BJP has lost
 darasal bijepi isliye bhi is ilaake main sakriy ho gai he kyonki chunaav main uski yahaan se siten kam hui, saath hi saurashtra se hi aane vaale patidaar netaa paresh dhanani ko congress ne vipaksh kaa netaa bana diya he
 Due to all this, the Vijay Rupani government was forced to consider its agricultural policy
 jo kisaanon ke bich asantosh kaa ek bada kaaran bani hui he
 Paresh Dhanani Farmer Family Relations Congress President Rahul Gandhi has been calling the BJP government as anti-farmer
 gujarat main bijepi ko gherne ke liye or lagaataar dabaav banane ke liye paresh dhanani, alpesh thakur or jignesh mevani aawaaj uthaa sakate hai
 Paresh Dhanani is descended from a farmer family
 aise main wo kisaanon se jude mudde par sadan main sarkaar ko gher sakate hai
 At the same time Hardik Patel is gathering people against the government outside the House
 aise main bijepi ke liye kisaan or patidaar donon jagah apni sthiti ko behatar karne kii badi chunauti he
 Focus on Saurashtra Saurashtra has been a traditional area of the BJP
 bijepi 1995 main isi kshetra ke sahare pehali baar rajya kii satta par virajman hui thi
 She was successful in winning 44 out of 54 seats, but this time it is the fort of BJP
 congress ne sendhamari karte hue 29 siten jeetin to bijepi ko 25 siten milin
 In such a situation, the Rupani government is devising a strategy to vent the anger of the people of Saurashtra
 iske jariye kisaanon kii samasyaon kaa nidaan kiya jayega
 Along with the industry, the BJP government will also focus on agricultural policies

 bihar ke vaishali jile kii ek mahila ne apane pati ko talaak dene kaa faisalaa kiya he, kyonki uske pati ne ghar main shauchalay nahin banwaaya
 In fact, 25-year-old Sunita Devi was married to Dheeraj Chaudhary in 2011
 unke koi santan nahin thi
 The woman, who lives in paharpur-bishanpur panchayat of Vaishali, constantly asked her husband to build toilets, but her husband did not pay attention to her demand to build toilets
 jab bhi vah khule main shouch ke liye jaati, use apane pati ke lagaataar taane or fabtiyaan sunani padatin
 Ultimately, Sunita decides that enough is enough, she will no longer be forced to go to the open defecation and will not hear her husband's constant taunts and sarcasm
 iske baad usne apane vakil ke jariye apane pati ko yah khabar bhijwa di ki ab vah shaadi or jari nahin rakh sakati, kyonki uske ghar main shauchalay nahin he or jise ghar main banavaane ke liye uskaa pati bhi taiyaar nahin he
 If we look at the problem of lack of toilets in India, especially in villages, then it will be revealed that open defecation is a truth for millions of people in rural areas and especially women have to face a lot of taunts due to lack of toilets in their home
 , Because they defecate in the open, that too mostly in the dark
 sunita ke pati kaa bhi maananaa he ki ghar main shauchalay nahin hone kii vajah se donon ke rishton main daraar ai, lekin uskaa yah bhi maananaa he ki uske paas shauchalay banavaane ke liye paise nahin the
 If we look at the problem of toilet in the village, according to recently received data-comments -bihar ke 82 fisadi gramin gharon main shauchalay nahin he - Under the Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan, a 15-year-old government scheme, every household in the country should get around Rs 10,000 for making toilet
 -centre sarkaar is yojana par nae sire se bal de rahi he
 But the difficulty is that in most cases this money is neither complete, nor any account is kept of it and in many cases this money does not reach home
 vidambnaa yah he ki saal 2011 main, pahadpur-bisanpur naamak panchayat ko centre sarkaar ne nirmal gram ghoshit kiya tha, yah bataate hue ki yah jagah khule main shouch se mukt he
 There is no one to answer how such an announcement was made
 vaishali kii pahadpur-bisanpur panchayat main rahane vaali is mahila ne lagaataar apane pati se shauchalay banavane ko kaha, lekin uske pati ne uski shauchalay banavaane kii maang par dhyaan nahin diya
 Whenever she went out to defecate in the open, she had to listen to her husband's constant taunts and snitches
 akhirkaar sunita ne tay kar liya ki ab bahut hua, vah ab khule main shouch ke liye jane ko majaboor nahin hogi or apane pati ke lagaataar taane or fabtiyaan nahin sunegi
 She then sent the news to her husband through her lawyer that she could no longer continue the marriage, as there is no toilet in her house and which her husband is not even ready to build
 bharat main khaastaur par gaanvon main shauchalay kii kami jaisi samasya par dhyaan diya jaae to yah ujagar hoga ki gramin ilaaqon main lakhon logon ke liye khule main shouch ek sachai he or khaaskar auraton ko ghar main shauchalay na hone se taane or kaaphi kuch jhelana padataa he, kyonki ve khule main shouch karti hai, vah bhi zyaadaatar andhere main
 Sunita's husband also believes that there was a rift in their relationship due to lack of toilets in the house, but he also believes that he did not have the money to build a toilet
 gaanv main shauchalay kii samasya par najar daalen to, haal hi main praapt aankadon ke mutabik-tippaniyan 82 percent of Bihar's rural households do not have toilets -15 saal puraani ek sarkari yojana 'nirmal bharat abhiyaan' ke tahat desh ke har ghar ko toilet banane ke liye kareeb 10,000 rupee milane chahie - The Central Government is giving a new thrust to this scheme
 lekin mushkil ye he ki zyaadaatar maamalon main ye paisa na to puraa padataa he, na hi iskaa koi hisaab-kitaab rakhaa jaataa he or kai maamalon main to yah paisa ghar tak pahunchataa hi nahin
 Ironically, in 2011, a panchayat named paharpur-bishanpur was declared as Nirmal Gram by the central government, stating that the place is open defecation free
 iskaa jawaab dene vaala koi nahin he ki aisi ghoshnaa kaise kii gai? Whenever she went out to defecate in the open, she had to listen to her husband's constant taunts and snitches
 akhirkaar sunita ne tay kar liya ki ab bahut hua, vah ab khule main shouch ke liye jane ko majaboor nahin hogi or apane pati ke lagaataar taane or fabtiyaan nahin sunegi
 She then sent the news to her husband through her lawyer that she could no longer continue the marriage, as there is no toilet in her house and which her husband is not even ready to build

 , Because they defecate in the open, that too mostly in the dark

 yah pichley saal kii baat he, jab roger federer apane pasandida ol england club (wimbledon ke naam se kahin zyaada mashhoor) ke tennis court main ho rahe quarter final mukaable main wilfred songa ke haathon haar gaye the
 
 
 This was the first time Federer could not win a match even after winning the first two sets in a Grand Slam match
 
 
 vaise yah haal wimbledon hi nahin, duusare grand slam toornamenton main bhi dikhaai de rahaa tha
 
 
 Federer, who won the most Grand Slam titles in the world, had been craving for the Grand Slam title for the past two and a half years
 
 
 novak jokovich or rafel nadal ke saamne vah number 3 se aage nahin bad paa rahe the
 
 
 i also felt that, no matter how big a star it is, one day comes when its days begin to take over
 
 
 or, aisa main hi nahin, mere jaise tamaam log sochane lage the
 
 
 But maybe Federer is made of some other clay
 
 
 unhone pichhali baar kaha tha, main ek baar phir waapas aauungaa
 
 
 And despite this, when he arrived at Wimbledon this year, no one had any idea that he would defy everyone
 
 
 nadal kii apratyaashit haar ne unki mushkil kam zarur kar di thi, parantu sanshay barkaraar tha
 
 
 Then in the semi-finals, he was confronted by a fiery player like Novak Djokovic, and the simple way in which he defeated him felt that form kept on coming and going, class always
 
 
 or phir jokovich ke baad endi mare par bhi federer ne raham nahin kiya, or itihaas rach daalaa
 
 
 Federer and Murray both had tears in their eyes after the final
 
 
 lekin federer ke aansu jeet ke nahin the
 
 
 He was, in fact, a spill of that trust, due to which he was going to play every Grand Slam for two and a half years
 
 
 tamaam aalochanaon ke baad bhi na unka bharosa dagamagaaya tha, na unki patibaddhta main koi kami ai thi
 
 
 On the other hand, somewhere in the sorrow and tears of Murray, there will be some respect for the trust of his genius partner
 
 
 federer wimbledon kaa purush ekal khitaab saatvin baar jite hai
 
 
 Pete Sampras has been his role model, and now Federer is on par with him in terms of winning the Wimbledon title
 
 
 itnaa hi nahin, is kamyaabi ne unhen ek baar phir duniya kaa number van khilaadi bana diya he
 
 
 He has also equaled the record on one side of Sampras being the number one player for 286 weeks (not continuously)
 
 
 vaise ab unke grand slam khitaabon kii sankhya 17 ho chuki he, jo ek vishwarecord he, or itane khitaab koi doosraa jeet paaegaa, yah nikat bhavishya main sambhav nahin dikhataa
 
 
 Federer's dedication and commitment to tennis is worth watching
 
 
 khel ke prati unka anushaasan unke kad ko or badha detaa he
 
 
 He has developed a special tune of tennis like a musician
 
 
 aaj, jab aadhunik tennis court power game kaa akhaada banataa ja rahaa he, unke khel main aaj bhi khaas nafaasat dekhne ko milti he, bhale hi vah tufaani sarvice ho yaa ek haath se sadha hua back-hand ritern
 
 
 This is the reason why Federer is mesmerized even if he is losing
 
 
 unki galtiyaan bhi dusron ke vinar shot se zyaada parfect lagati hai
 
 
 This is the reason why even after the age of 30 years, he is present in the field with full power compared to the youth
 
 
 aaj ke daur main ek dashak tak sheersh par bane rahanaa koi hansi-khel nahin he
 
 
 The comments aap unki tulana sachin tendulkar se bhi kar sakate hai, jinke liye hasil karne ko kuch bhi baaki nahin
 
 
 But there was no decrease in passion for the game
 
 
 haalanki federer ke mukaable sachin kuch zyaada aaraamdeh sthiti main hai, kyonki tennis team game nahin he or isamen dam-kham bhi kuch zyaada lagata he, lekin federer feet bhi hai or ek-do saal khelte rahane kaa dam-kham bhi unamem abhi maujuud he
 
 
 If you look closely at Federer's journey so far, then he shows that his style is very friendly
 
 
 vah jahaan bhi jate hai, dost bana lete hai
 
 
 His friendship with history and records is strong
 
 
 isse ummid bandhati he ki tennis ke itihaas or record main federer ke naam abhi kuch or panne baaki hai
 
 
 But it would be better for Federer to leave the game at the top, because an army of young players can sidestep the biggest genius of tennis, it would be better to free up space for himself
 
 
 lekin shaayad federer kisi duusari mitti ke bane hue hai
 
 
 He said last time, i will come back once more
 
 
 or uske baavjood jab is saal bhi vah wimbledon pahunche to kisi ko andaaza nahin tha ki vah sabko jhuthla denge
 
 
 Nadal's unexpected defeat had lessened his difficulty, but the doubt remained
 
 
 phir semifinal main unki takkar novak jokovich jaise tejatarraar khilaadi se hui, or unhone jis sahaj andaaj main use haraaya, usase laga ki form aati-jaati rahati he, class hameshaa bana rahata he
 
 
 And after Djokovic, Federer was not even kind to Andy Murray, and created history
 
 
 final ke baad federer or mare, donon kii ankhon main aansu the
 
 
 But Federer's tears were not of victory
 
 
 vah darasal, us bharose kaa chhalakna tha, jiske boote vah dhai saal se har grand slam khilne pahunch rahe the
 
 
 Despite all the criticisms, neither did his trust waver, nor did his commitment fall short
 
 
 duusari taraf, mare ke gam-chhalakaate aansuon main bhi kahin na kahin apane jeniyas saathi ke bharose kaa sammaan chipa hoga hi
 
 
 Federer won Wimbledon's men's singles title for the seventh time
 
 
 peet sampraas unke adarsh rahe hai, or ab wimbledon khitaab jeetne ke maamle main federer unki barabari par pahunch gaye hai
 
 
 Not only this, this success has made him once again the number one player in the world
 
 
 286 saptaah tak (lagaataar nahin) number van khilaadi rahane ke sampraas ke ek ore record kii barabari bhi unhone kar lee he
 
 
 However, now the number of his Grand Slam titles has increased to 17, which is a World Record, and so many titles will be won by another, this is unlikely to happen in the near future
 
 
 tennis ke prati federer kaa samarpan or patibaddhta dekhne laayak hoti he
 
 
 His discipline towards sports further enhances his stature
 
 
 vah kisi sangeetkaar kii tarah tennis kii ek khaas dhun viksit kar chuke hai
 
 
 Today, as the modern tennis court is becoming the arena of the power game, his game still has a special edge, whether it is stormy service or a hand-held back-hand return
 
 
 yahi vajah he ki federer agar haar bhi rahe hon to unka khel mantrmugdh kar detaa he
 
 
 His mistakes also seem more perfect than the winner shots of others
 
 
 yahi vajah he ki 30 saal kii umr bitne ke baad bhi vah yuvaaon ke mukaable puure damakham ke saath maidan main maujuud hai
 
 
 Staying on top for a decade today is no laughing matter
 
 
 tippaniyan You can also compare him with Sachin Tendulkar, for whom there is nothing left to gain
 
 
 lekin khel ke prati pishan main koi kami nahin ai
 
 
 Although Sachin is in a more comfortable position than Federer, because the tennis team is not a game and it takes a lot of courage, but Federer is also fit and he has the ability to play a year or two
 
 
 
 federer ke ab tak ke safar par agar gaur se nazar daalen to pataa chalata he ki unka andaaj bahut dostana he
 
 
 Wherever he goes, he makes friends
 
 
 itihaas or record se unki dosti to gadhi he hi
 
 
 This gives hope that Federer's name is still a few more pages in the history and records of tennis
 
 
 lekin behatar yahi hoga ki federer sheersh par rahete hue khel ko alavida kah den, kyonki yuva khilaadiyon kii fouj tennis ke is sabase bade jeniyas ko kinare kar de, isse behatar yahi hoga ki vah khud hi unke liye jagah khaali kar den

 Talk in private Often women get so upset about their partner's bad habits that they keep watch over them all the time
 bhale hi saathi apane doston ke bich main kyon ne khadaa ho ek cigarette sulagaate hi ve sulag padati hai apane pati par
 If you do the same, be careful
 aapaki ye aadat unhen apni smoking kii aadat ko chhodane par majaboor to nahin karegi haa, aapse dur jarur kar sakati he
 So whenever you talk to them in this matter, keep in mind that both of you are alone
 akele main aap unhen ji bhar kos sakati hai
 Increase the distance
 If your partner is not giving up his bad habit even after persuading you, then it would be better that you make a proper distance from them
 duuri kaa matlab ye katai nahin he ki aap unhen akelaa chhod den, yahaan duuri kaa matlab he unke man main akele pen kaa bhay paidaa karnaa
 Make yourself feel that if your partner is not able to give up his habits even if he wants, then give him mental support
 unhen ahsaas karaaen kii aap unke saath hai, unke liye
 Ask them how you can help them in this direction
 phir dekhie unke dil main aapke liye pyaar or buree aadat ke liye nafrat kaise paidaa hoti he

 Your image is that of a modern leader, you are supported by the corporate world

 a penalty from Jan Jan Huntelaar on penalty in Injury Time, Netherlands made a spectacular comeback to beat Mexico 2–1 to enter the quarter-finals of the World Cup

 Giovanni Dos Santos scored the first goal for Mexico in the 48th minute
 aisa lagane laga tha ki mexico 1986 ke baad pehali baar vishwa cap ke antim aath main jagah bana legaa, lekin westle snider ne 88wein minute main netherland ke liye barabari kaa gol daaga
 At the same time, Huntellar did not allow the extra penalty to be extended further by converting the crucial penalty in injury time

 uttar pradesh ke vidhansabha chunaavon ke liye pehle daur kii voting 11 farvari ko hogi or is charan ke liye adhisuchana 17 janvari ko jari kii jaaegi
 This date is especially important for the Samajwadi Party, because if the party fails to reach the end of its home turmoil, then after this date, it will lose the scope of the agreement and both its factions will get new party and new name
 Have to get on the field with
 gauratlab he ki samaajawaadee party mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav or apane rashtriya adhyaksh mulaayam singh yadav ke bich do dhadon main bant gai he
 Both camps are fighting the battle for possession of the party and its election symbol in the Election Commission
 jo bhi is ladaai main vijayi rahegaa samaajawaadee party or sarkaar usee kii maani jaaegi lekin aisa bhi ho saktaa he ki donon hi paksh philhal jeet se dur rahen or na party kaa naam bachaa saken, na cycle kaa chunaav chinh
 Recently, former Chief Election Commissioner SY Qureshi himself made it clear in a special conversation with Aaj Tak that the Election Commission took a few months to take its final decision on the way the two factions of the SP are claiming in the name of the election symbol and the party
 Can
 aise main ho saktaa he ki kisi bhi dhade ko party kaa chunaav chinh na mili
 It is clear from Qureshi that at this moment of election both the factions of the party have very limited options
 pehla vikalp-akhilesh or mulaayam aapas main ekajute hon
 Both the parties should withdraw their claims made in the Election Commission and get united in the election symbol of the cycle under the banner of SP
 doosraa vikalp-akhilesh or mulaayam main se koi ek sapa or cycle par apana daawa chode
 Make a sense of your power by creating your own party so that no harm is done to the party and its symbols
 teesraa vikalp-akhilesh or mulaayam singh donon hi cycle par daawey jataate rahen
 The Election Commission should freeze this symbol
 donon hi gut kisi nae nishaan or party ke badale hue naam (sapa-akhilesh or sapa-mulaayam) se chunaav laden or apni takat kaa ahsaas karaaen
 Given the surat-e-hall of sp's pride so far, the possibility of first and second options seems unlikely
 aise main zyada sambhaavna isi baat kii he ki cycle chunaav chinh in chunaavon main dekhne ko na mili or samaajawaadee party kii jagah sapa-e or sapa-em jaisi do nai partiyaan chunaav maidan main dikhen

 chunaav ke samay netaa, votaron ke dil tak pahunchane ke liye jameen-aasmaan ek kar dete hai
 Seeing the strictness of the Election Commission on the ground in the Uttar Pradesh elections, the leaders tried to reach the hearts of the voters through the sky and found a way out
 lekin netaa hawa main udate, usase pehle hi chunaav ayog ne unki door kaat di
 If the leaders walk, then all the streets of the city and village should be filled with poster banners
 lekin poster or bannron ke jariye takat dikhaane ke din lad gaye
 The strictness of the Election Commission is now such that the new banner posters will be installed, the old ones have also been removed
 uttar pradesh ke shaharon main har chauraahey par kuch dinon pehle tak netaaon ke itane poster lage the ki ginana mushkil
 But all were removed as soon as elections were declared
 tabhi netaaon ko ek upaay soojha
 There is a tradition of flying kites all over North India at the time of Makar Sankranti
 netaaon ne sochaa ki kyon naa isi bahaane votaron ke sir par mandaraaya jaae
 The leaders made a gesture to their supporters and upon seeing the kite shops got flooded with kites of Modi, Mulayam Singh and Akhilesh Yadav
 lekin netaa patangon par savaar hokar hawa main udate isse pehle hi chunaav ayog ko bhanak lag gai
 The election commission made it clear that posters of leaders cannot fly in the sky in the form of kites
 kaha gaya ki ye chunaav aachaar samhita kaa ulanghan hoga or jo dukandaar aisi patangen bechata hua paaya jayega uske khilaaf karrwai kii jaaegi
 All the shops in Farrukhabad in Uttar Pradesh were full of such kites
 patangon ke jariye kahin modi kii photo ke saath sargical strike kaa gungan ho rahaa tha to kahin akhilesh yadav apni express-ve ke saath muskura rahe the
 The sale was also doing well but only then many such kites were confiscated from all the shops by raiding on the orders of the Election Commission
 ab aisi sari patangen kabad main padi hai
 The Election Commission is strictly discouraged but this is not the first time
 uttar pradesh main hi pichley vidhansabha chunaav main chunaav ayog ke aadesh par mayawati ke banaae hue tamaam pathar ke haathiyon ko dhak diya gaya tha
 Elephant is the election mark of Bahujan Samaj Party
 lekin chunaav ayog ke farmaan kaa sabase mjedaar udhaaharan 2013 main chhattisgarh ke vidhansabha chunaav main dekhne ko mila tha
 Then on the complaint of the Congress, the Election Commission had ordered that all the flowers of the lotus flower bloom along the roads should be covered because it is a sign of the BJP

 The Supreme Court has abolished triple talaq
 court ke faisle ko lekar muslim samaaj main kai tarah ke sawaal hai
 To what extent is the judgment of the court justified in the light of Quran Hadish
 iskaa muslim samaaj par kya prabhaav padhegaa
 Now if a person gives triple divorce to his wife, what will be the way for him in such a situation
 aise tamaam sawaalon ke jawaab ke liye jamiya millia islamia vishvavidhyalay ke islamic studies ko professor junayd haaris se aajtak
 in talked islam ke haq main faislaprofessor junayd haaris kehete hai-supreme court ne van seatingtripal talakako jo khatm kiya he, vah koi nayaa kaam nahin he, balki islam to 1400 saal pehle hi ise bain kar chukaa he
 In such a case, the decision of the court is in favor of Islam
 van sinting tripal talaak quran, hadeesh sahit sabhi ke najadik haraam he
 Despite this, the people of Hanafi Maslak (ideology) among Muslims believe that they have done wrong if someone has divorced one sitting triple, but divorce will happen
 musalamaanon ke paas dand dene kaa praavdhaan nahinjunaid haaris kehete hai- tripal talaak dene vaale shaks ko hanfi masalak bhi dand dene kii ijaajat detaa he
 But there is no constitutional provision for punishing Muslims in India
 dand dene kaa adhikaar sirf yahaan court ko hai
 In such a situation, i understand that the court and the government would sit with the scholars of Hanafi Maslak and determine the provision of punishment and implement it
 hanfi masalak par padhegaa prabhaavajunayd kehete hai ki supreme court ke faisle kaa prabhaav sabase zyada hanfi masalak par padhegaa
 In fact, there is a large population of people who believe in Hanafi ideology in India
 isi vicharadhara main tripal talaak ke maamle zyada he
 The decision of the court is more important for those Muslims, who solve their case through the court
 vahiin duusari ore ye faisla unke liye mahatv nahin rakhata, jo apane maamle muslim personal lau ke tahat hal karaate hai
 He has said that triple talaq is banned in all the countries of the world
 iske baavjood vahaan tripal talaak aaj bhi ho rahe hai
 Be it the case of Pakistan or Bangladesh
 aise main bharat main ab ise court ne khatm kar diya he, lekin isamen kami tabhi aegi jab musalamaanon ke bich jaagarukta abhiyaan chalaaya jaae
 We hope that this should not be politically attributed
 varanaa iskaa bhi hashr usee tarah hoga jaise baaki chizon ko court ne to bain kiya he, lekin vah raajnneetik karan kii bhent chadh gai
 Now divorce cases will increase more in the court, says that after the Supreme Court's verdict, now if a Muslim woman gives a triple divorce to a Muslim woman, it will now depend on the woman whether she goes to court or in a poignant manner Solves it
 ye vikalp pehle bhi tha
 But now divorce cases will go more in court
 jin mahilaon ne ladi ladaai unhen kya milajunaid haaris kehete hai- jin peedit mahilaon ne van seating tripal talaak ke khilaaf puri ladaai ladi hai ab dekhnaa he ki sarkaar unke liye kya karti he
 It has been a long time since their divorce
 aise main unamem se kuch ke shauharon kii shaadiyaan ho chuki hai, to kuch ke mar chuke honge
 Not only this, the gap of enmity between them has deepened by going to court
 aise main sarkaar unke punarutthan ke liye kadam uthaae

 sabase pehle justise eke sikri ne apana faisla padhaa
 While reading the judgment in the case, Justice Sikri said that all the executive rights in the capital will remain with the Delhi government
 justise ashok bhushan ne bhi kuch muddon par justise sikri ke saath sahmati jataai, lekin transfar-posting ke mudde par donon jajon main matbhed hi rahaa, isliye is mudde ko badi bench ke paas bhej diya gaya he
 However, all rights related to land, police and law and order in Delhi will remain with the Central Government i
e
 the Lieutenant Governor
 haalanki, ye abhi antim faisla nahin he kyonki do jajon kii bench main matbhed hota dikh rahaa he
 It is important to note that the matter of Delhi Government vs Lieutenant Governor was raised by the Kejriwal Government in Delhi
 hai court ne apane faisle main uparajyapal ko hi dilli kaa bos bataaya tha
 On August 4, 2016, the Delhi High Court, while hearing this issue, had said that the Lieutenant Governor is the administrative head of Delhi and the Delhi government cannot legislate without the will of the Lieutenant Governor
 hai court ke faisle ke anusaar, uparajyapal dilli sarkaar ke faisle ko maanane ke liye baadhya nahin hai or vah apane vivek ke aadhaar par faisla le sakate hai, saath hi dilli sarkaar ko kisi bhi tarah kaa notification jari karne se pehle alji kii anumati leni hi hogi
 The Aam Aadmi Party government of the state had approached the Supreme Court against this decision of the Delhi High Court
 5 jajon kii samvidhan peeth ne 6 disambar, 2017 ko apana faisla surakshit rakh liya tha
 The Nirbhaya case could not be executed even after 7 years, the Delhi government has rejected Daya Yachik, after the rape of a female doctor in Hyderabad, once again the wounds of the Nirbhaya gang rape have died
 puure desh ko hilaa kar rakh dene vaali is ghatana ko saat saal guzar gaye lekin nichali adaalat se lekar supreme court tak se faansee kii sajaa paa chuke aropiyon ko ab tak sajaa nahin di ja saki he
 On the one hand, the demand for execution of the death sentence given to Nirbhaya convicts is gaining momentum, on the other hand, there is no executioner in the largest jails of Asia
 aise main yah sawaal bhi uthne laga he ki doshiyon ko faansee kii sajaa di kaise jaaegi
 In this regard, the jail administration says that whenever a convict has to be sentenced to death, those jails who have their executioners are contacted
 ek din ke liye laae jaaenge jalladgel prashasan ke anusaar ek din ke liye jallaad ko tihaad laayaa jaataa he
 The hangman returns to his deployed prison after hanging the convict

 Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has also demanded that the accused be punished soon, amid public outcry over the Hyderabad incident
 dilli sarkaar ne dayaa yachika par likhaa- 'maafee nahin'dilli sarkaar ne nirbhaya ke doshi vinay kii dayaa yachika kii file main 'maafee nahin' likh kar uparajyapal (alji) ke paas bhej di he
 CM Kejriwal also clarified that the Delhi government is not in favor of waiving the death sentence of the convict for committing such heinous crime
 kejariwal ne doshiyon ko kadi sajaa die jane kii vakaalat kar yah jataa diya kidilli sarkaarrape ke doshiyon ke saath narmi barte jane ke paksh main bilkul bhi nahin he
 Mercy petition will be sent to the President The mercy petition sent to the Lieutenant Governor by writing 'no Apology' by the government has now gone to Director Delhi
 ise vah bharat sarkaar ke grih vibhaag ko bhejenge
 Eventually the mercy petition will be sent to the President
 agarrashtrapatidaya yachika khaarij kar dete hai to phir jail prashasan court jayega or court se deth warrant, jise blike warrant bhi kehete hai, vah jari karegaa
 After the death warrant is issued from the court, the way of hanging the culprits will be cleared
 bataa den ki faansee kii sajaa paae chaar doshiyon main se keval ek vinay ne hi dayaa yachika lagaai he

 rajasthan ke alvar main kathith gorakshakon ddhara rakabar kii hatya ke maamle main vasundhara raaje kii police par sawaal khadey hone lage hai
 a man named Rakbar Khan was beaten to death by the alleged guards on charges of cow smuggling
 is puure maamle par police kii timming par sawaal uth rahe hai
 If the police had taken Rakbar to hospital on time, his life could have been saved
 darasal rakabar kaa ilaaj karne vaale doctoron or police ko ghatana kii jaankaree dene vaale ke bayaan se to aisa hi lag rahaa he
 The police had received information about the attack on Rakbar at 12
40 pm, but the police rushed him to the hospital for treatment at 3 pm
 aise main sawaal uthta he ki 2 se 2
 Where was Rakbar for 30 hours
 police ke mutabik 12
 As soon as the information was received at 40, she reached the spot
 police ko soochna dene or police ke saath gaadi main jane vaale navalkishor sharma ne kaha raat ko ek baje police ghayal ko ramgarh thane main lekar pahunchi
 But the doctors treating Rakbar say the police brought him to the hospital at 3 am
 aise main police par sawaal uth rahaa he ki do ghante akbar kahaan tha
 Alwar SP Rajendra Singh has given a statement in the case of Rakbar Khan's death also due to the beating of police
 unhone kaha ki maamle kii jaanch kii ja rahi he, agar police vaale doshi nikle to unako sajaa di jaaegi
 Navlakishor Sharma, who first reported the incident to Rakbar's policemen, said that the police not only delayed the treatment of Ghilakbarbar by two and a half to three hours, but also took him to Ramgarh police station and assaulted him
 vahiin uski maut hui
 It is worth mentioning that in the FIR itself, the police have told Sharma to be the first to inform and take them to the spot
 sharma ke is sansanikhej khulaase se puure maamle main nayaa mode aa gaya he
 He told that when the injured brought Rakbar to the police station at night, he did not have serious injury and if there was an injury, why did the police not get him admitted to the hospital
 police rakabar ko 3 baje aspataal lekar gai, lekin tab tak uski maut ho chuki thi
 Navalkishore Sharma told that he gave about 12 to the police
 40 baje soochna de di thi
 About ten minutes later, he himself reached the police station
 jahaan se police team use sarkari vaahan main saath lekar ghatnasthal par pahunchi
 Rakbar was lying in mud here
 use koi aisi gambhir chot nahin thi jisase uski maut ho jaati
 So the police picked him up from the spot and took him directly to Ramgarh police station
 yahaan keechad main sane rakabar ko nahalaaya gaya or uske kapade geele ho jane ke kaaran police ne lalavandi nivasee dharmendra yadav ko bhejkar kapade mangaaye or ve kapade use pahanaae gaye
 During this, he was beaten up in the police station
 isi marpet se rakabar kii maut hui
 Navalkishore Sharma says that the police kept Rakbar in the police station for about two to two and a half hours
 uski maut police castady main marpet se hui he
 Sources say that the situation at Rakbar incident was not moribund
 aisa hota to police use lekar sidhe aspataal jaati
 Either his condition was fine or the police delayed treatment
 donon main koi ek hi vajah ho sakati he
 Apart from the claim of the police over the timing of the incident, the timeline of the events is also putting the police in the dock
 darasal police ne eesai mohan singh ke hawaale se darj exiaar main khud kaha ki use raat kareeb 12
 It was reported at 40
 aise main bada sawaal yah he ki police ek baje bhi ghayal akbar ko lekar chali to mahaj 4 kimi dur aspataal pahunchane main 3 ghante kaise lag gaye
 According to the doctor who treated Rakbar in the hospital, the police rushed him to the hospital at around 3 am
 yani ilaaj main kareeb teen ghante kii deree hui
 Dr Hasan Ali of the Community Health Center of Ramgarh said that the police had brought an unknown person who was in dead condition at 3 pm
 unhone kaha yah ghatana ek baje hui he to 3 baje tak yah vyakti kahaan tha
 Perhaps he could have been saved if he had been hospitalized on time

 When the police arrived late and started to take the child from the crowd, the angry police once again tied the child in a pole and beat him

 a case of gang-rape with a 20-year-old girl has been reported in Vasant Kunj, a posh area of south Delhi
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki yuvati ko mangalvaar kii raat priya cinema ke paas kareeb 12
 At 30, two youth kidnapped and took him to a house in Rangpuri hill area
 jahaan donon yuvakon kaa teesraa saathi bhi maujuud tha
 The girl was beaten first and then raped by the three youths
 iske baad yuvati ko vasant vihaar main gurudwara ke paas chhod diya gaya
 The victim called the PCR and lodged a complaint with the police
 police kii vine maukey par pahunchi or peedit yuvati ko paas ke aspataal le jaaya gaya jahaan jaanch ke baad rape kii pushti kar di gai
 Police went to Rangpuri hill with the girl from where the three accused were arrested
 teenon aropiyon ko buudhvaar ko court ke saamne pesh kiya gaya
 The court has sent the three to judicial custody till 20 March
 teenon aropiyon main se do privet company main kaam karte hai or ek ignu main padhai kar rahaa he
 The victimized girl works at once
 peedit yuvati ne pisiar ko phone kiya or police ke paas shikaayat darj karwaai
 The police van rushed to the spot and the victim was taken to a nearby hospital where the rape was confirmed after investigation
 police yuvati ko lekar rangapuri pahari gai, jahaan se teenon aropiyon ko giraftaar kar liya gaya
 The three accused were produced before the court on Wednesday
 court ne teenon ko 20 march tak nyaayik hiraasat main bhej diya he
 Two of the three accused work in a private company and one is studying in IGNOU
 peedit yuvati ek baar main kaam karti he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi is the undisputed electoral face of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and between July 25 and September 1, he addressed four rallies in Bihar
 agar 18 agast ko aara main sarkari aayojan ko bhi jod len to paanchavin raily ho jaati he
 Prime Minister in Ara 1 for the state
 25 lakh karod ru
 He announced his generosity with the announcement of a special package of the government and explored the political possibilities of joining the Center and one of the most backward states of the country with Bihar
 lekin achaanak 1 sitambar ke baad modi lagbhag maheene bhar bihar se dur rahe
 Then, on October 2, he was noticed at Banka in southeastern Bihar
 2015 ke sabase bade rajnatik takaraav kii tareekhen tay ho gai thim
 So, Modi immediately targeted his former ally but now anti-nitish Kumar
 usamen unhone behad tikhi boli or jumalebaji kaa istemaal kiya, jiske liye ve mashhoor hai
 He accused Nitish of keeping his ego above the interests of the state
 shaayad pradhanmantri ne yah style gujarat kii raajnneeti ke daur main viksit kii he, vikaas or pragati par jor dene vaale netaa kii haisiyat main to ve baad main pahunche hai
 Much has changed in these four-five weeks
 bihar kii ladaai kareebi muqabla hi maani jaati rahi he, haalanki 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav or uske baad hue rajnatik ghatnakramon ke baad bijepi or uske sahyogiyon ko badhat bhi milti dikhti rahi he
 But this increase has been steadily decreasing
 vajah kuch bhi ho sakati he, endie main tikaton ko lekar tanta ho yaa sahyogiyon ke saarvajanik rup se ruuthane-manaane kaa daur yaa phir aresas pramukh kii aarakshan par nuksandeh tippanee
 It seems that the BJP needs a new strategy to maintain its ground hold
 isi vajah se modi rajya main tufaani dauron kaa silsilaa shuru kar rahe hai or nitish or unke sahyogi lalu prasad yadav par hamalon kii jhadi lagaakar endie kii sarkaar banane par bihar ko badalane kaa vaada kar rahe hai
 India Today group-cicero's second opinion poll reveals the constantly changing mood of people on the ground
 sitambar main pehle surveykshan main anumaanit vot hissedari or siton kii sankhya donon main hi endie se maamuli antar se pichhadgaye vaale janata dal (united)&rashtriya janata dal-congress mahagathbandhan ne aktubar main hue duusare surveykshan main usase badhat le lee he
 The poll is projected to win a majority of 1 seat in the 243-member assembly (see survey chart)
 janamat surveykshan se pataa chalata he ki bijepi gramin or shahari votaron, jatigat samoohon or yuvaaon ke bich jedy (you) se pichad rahi he
 The BJP has retained its popularity among its traditional voters, the Savarnas, while it has not been able to make a dent in the JD (U) fort (backward caste, Mahadalit and Muslim)
 jedy (you) ne jati sambandhi samarthakon main apni pakad ko kaayam rakhaa he lekin yuva votaron main uski lokapriyata main maamuli giravat ai he lekin yahaan bhi vah bijepi se aage he
 bjp's popularity has declined in urban voters while JD (U) has increased
 yah khel kisi ke paksh main jaataa nahin dikh rahaa he, or aakhri vot tak myne rakhega
 It is no wonder that both sides are giving everything to win Bihar
 aise to yah mukhya hindi pradesh main ek saamaanya vidhansabha chunaav hi he
 This is not going to have any significant impact on the political future of the party in power at the Center, nor will it be considered an opinion on the 16 months of functioning of the Narendra Modi government at the Center
 vipaksh bhale hi aisa kah saktaa he kyonki agar aap bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ko apni tamaam takaton ko bulaava dete dekhte hai or modi ko itani urja tathaa vakt jhonkate dekhte hai to ekadam alag tarah kaa ehsaas hota he
 For Shah, the Bihar ground is a perfect opportunity to prove that the defeat of the Delhi Assembly was just an accident
 isse yah bhi sabit ho saktaa he ki ve bejod ranneetikaar hai or disambar-janvari main party adhyaksh pad ke unke duusare kaarykaal par aasaani se muhar lag sakati he
 Bihar's victory for Modi will not only be enough to tell that the Modi wave of 2014 is bad, it will also prove that his style of development and politics is justified in the Center and the states
 isse centre main unhen apni nitiyon ko aage badhaane main bhi aasaani ho jaaegi
 The stakes are so high that Modi does not hesitate to stand up directly against a local face against Nitish and these elections are filled with issues that have nothing to do with the state
 masalan, modi ke videsh daure, gujarat main hardik patel kaa aarakshan abhiyaan or nitish ko unka samarthan vagairah
 The stakes are almost equally high for Nitish and Lalu
 bihar main 2015 ke ye chunaav sirf patna main satta hasil karne kii hi ladaai nahin hai, balki unke rajnatik astitv or praasangikta kaa bhi sangharsh he
 In the 1980s and early 1990s, Nitish, called Lalu's Chanakya, emerged himself and ran the state on his own for almost a decade from 2005
 2015 nitish ke liye rajnatik vidambnaa kii tarah aa khadaa hua he
 His image has remained one of the most powerful leaders in Bihar due to his mastery of good governance and social equations, breaking ties with the NDA after Modi became Prime Ministerial candidate in 2013
 haalanki 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main unki yah ranneeti kargar nahin hui
 When Nitish lost badly, he was forced to raise his hand towards Lalu
 aktubar 2015 main unke isi faisle kii pariksha honi he
 Lalu Yadav has been out on bail since he was convicted in the fodder scam in 2013 and cannot contest elections
 unki patni rabari devi bhi, lagata he, 2010 main do vidhansabha siton or 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main baari paraajay jhelkar chunavi raajnneeti main dilchaspee kho baithi hai
 Still, Lalu did not hesitate to pursue his family's interests in this election
 aise main 2015 kaa vidhansabha chunaav unke liye apni viraasat do gaiyr-anbhavi beton tej pratap or tejasvi ko saunpane kaa aakhri mauka ho saktaa he
 Historian Romila Thapar tells the history of ancient India as the story of ancient Bihar
 ve kahati hai ki bharat ne shiksha, prashasan, samaaj yaa dharm ke kshetra main jo bhi uplabdhiyaan hasil kii hai, sabhi kii jaden bihar main hai
 It was centuries ago
 samakaleen bihar to maanav vikaas suchakank yaa samgr utpaadan yaa moolbhoot suvidhaon, swasthya, shiksha or kanoon-vyavastha ke maamle main desh ke sabhi bade rajyon se kaaphi pichhadaa hua he
 According to Arnab Mukherjee, Associate Professor at the Center for Public Policy at the Indian Institute of Management in Bangalore, Bihar has three phases
 vibhaajan ke pehle kii arthvyavastha vaala bihar, vibhaajan ke baad kii arthvyavastha (2000-2005 kaa daur) or 2005 ke chunaavon ke baad kaa daur, jab jedy (you) or bijepi gathjod ke saath nitish satta main aae
 In this third phase, Mukherjee, Bihar saw major changes in policies, administration and economic progress
 ve kehete hai, “yah daur sankhyagat or gunatmak donon hi maamalon main pehle ke daur se ekadam alag dikhaa
 An average man of Bihar was achieving 30 percent more than the average man of the country
 nitish ne is fark ko mitaayaa
 After decades of neglect, the average Bihari's account showed significant gains
 ”vibhaajan se bihar kii pragati kaaphi prabhavit hui
 The newly formed state of Jharkhand took over three-fourths of the entire resources while it accounted for only one-fourth of the liabilities
 is vibhaajan se udyogon ko baari jhatka laga jo avibhajit bihar main sakal rajya gharelu utpaada (jiesdipi) main 24 pratishat tak kii hissedari kar rahe the
 His share in the divided Bihar was just four percent
 bihar kii arthvyavastha puri tarah krishi par aadhaarit ho gai, jo hameshaa hi sookhe or baari barish kii chapet main rahati ai he
 But after the 2005 elections, there was a sudden boom in the economy of Bihar
 2005 or 2010 ke bich bihar main sakal vaarshik vruddhi dar 8
 6 percent, while the increase in the whole country is 7
 04 pratishat kii rahi he
 Experts attribute this to the expansion of roads and bridges to Nitish, though Bihar is still far behind the national average in this case
 bihar kaa yah parivartan kaabile gaur he lekin nnya rajya main is pragati kii dar banaae rakhane kii kshamta he? arnab mukherjee or jeenyu ke centre for iconomic studies and planning ke professor anjan mukherjee kii daleel he ki majboot netritv ke abhaav, naukari ke laayak ummidavaaron or peshewar prashikshan kii kami se bihar phir jaldi hi peeche ja saktaa he
 This seems to set the stage for Nitish and also for Lalu
 maamla naaron or surkhiyon main chaane kii tamanna vaale bayanon main kuch had tak khota ja rahaa he
 Before the first phase of voting, both the main coalitions are spending more time in caste and beef dispute
 lalu ne pehle kaha, “hindu bhi bif khate hai
 "then, to compensate for the loss, blamed" Satan "who" put this thing in my mouth
 " ” aresas pramukh ke jati aarakshan ko lekar bayaan kaa asar kam karne keliye jujh rahe bijepi netaaon ke liye yah nayaa mudda raahat lekar aayaa
 Not surprisingly, Nitish's alliance with Lalu is being treated like a double-edged sword, whose rule in Bihar is called the "jungle State"
 lalu kii yadav jati kii bihar kii aabaadi main hissedari 14 pratishat hone kaa anumaan he
 Nitish is expected to benefit greatly from this alliance in terms of votes
 lekin jedy (you) ke bheetar yah ashanka he ki lalu ke bare main prachlit dharanaen duusari jatiyon main nitish ke samarthakon ko bidka bhi sakati hai
 Nitish probably realizes this danger
 isi se andaja lag jaataa he ki kyon jedy (you) ke hordings or postaron main sirf nitish ke sushasan kii hi charchaa he
 Efforts are on to convert these elections into an opinion poll on Nitish's good governance
 bihar main har koi yah maanata he ki nitish ke raaj main rajya ne pragati kii he, isse jedy (you) ko shuruaati badhat mil gai he
 The challenge for Lalu and Nitish is to persuade their traditional vote to vote in favor of each other
 siton ke talmail main lalu kaa asar saaf-saaf dikh rahaa he
 The RJD chief has also forced the JD (U) to leave the seats won in 2010
 masalan, raghopur or mahua main kramshah unke bete tejasvi or tejpratap lard rahe hai
 There are many such cases but in return RJD left the last won Babudarhi only seat of JD (U) in Madhubani district
 aise main jedy (you) ke baagi netaaon ke samarthak nitish ke saath bane rahete hai yaa duusari ore rukh kar lete hai, yah sawaal kai ummidavaaron kaa bhagya tay kar saktaa he
 B
 JP is also not free from these problems
 amit shah jab patna ke baad apane prachaar kii antim ranneeti tay kar rahe the tab bhi party ko baagiyon ko kaabo main rakhane ke liye jujhna pad rahaa tha
 The party workers, who were not getting tickets, had to work hard to overcome the disillusionment
 nitish haalanki dohare satta virdohi rujhaan se rou-ba-rou hai
 lalu-rabri's 15-year-old jungle raj is also associated with his ten-year rule
 bijepi ke netaaon ko lalu-nitish kii ek or ranneetik bhul se laabh milane kii ummid he
 There are 41 seats left for the Congress
 2010 main congress ne sabhi siton par chunaav ladaa tha lekin sirf chaar siten hi jeet pai thi
 bjp's promoter Devesh Kumar says, "this time there are no votes yet, but the figure is going to be 41-0
" ” phir bhi behad kareeb mukaable vaale is chunaav main kai tarah ke sameekaran or gananaaen behad ulat-pulat kar sakati hai
 (with Shweta Punj) pakistan main raajnneetik netritv or sena main tanaav main bich pradhanmantri yusuf raja gilaani ne shuukravaar ko kaha ki unhen sansad main vishwaas mat hasil karne kii aavashyaktaa nahin he
 Gilani said these things in the National Assembly
 isse pehle buudhvaar ko gilaani ne sena pramukh ashfak parvej kayaani ke kareebi samajhe jane vaale raksha sachiv naeem khalid lodhi ko pad se hataa diya tha, jiske baad sena pramukh ne sheersh cmanderon kii baithak bulaai thi
 Gilani, in an interview to a Chinese newspaper, accused Kayani and Lt Gen Shuja Pasha, head of the country's intelligence agency inter-services Intelligence (ISI), of violating the constitution, saying they had sent 'confidential messages' to the US
 Illegal answers were filed before the Supreme Court investigating the case
 sena ne is par pratikriya vyakt karte hue 'gambheer parinaam' kii chetavanee di
 Since then, there has been speculation of military revolt in Pakistan
 desh main modi kii lahar he yaa nahin ye to loksabhaa chunaav ke nattejey bataaenge lekin fasebuk se lekar whatsap tak bijepi ke piem ummidavaar kaa jaadu chaaya hua he

 unhone kaha, 'dablychaoke prati apni katibaddhta or adhikarashetra ke tahat mujhedbluechoko is daan dene kii ghoshnaa karne main khushi ho rahi he ki 10 lakh dollar dablyuechao aakasmik vyaykosh ke liye 10 lakh dollar paraamarsh visheshgy kaary bal ke atargat aane vaali yojanaon ke liye hoga

 During the campaigning for the Lok Sabha elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party and Prime Minister Narendra Modi shouted out the government-run projects
 inhen main se ek har ghar main bijli pahunchane vaali saubhaahgya yojana he
 Claiming the success of 'pradhan Mantri Sahaj Bijli Ghar Yojana- Saubhagya', PM Modi had said in Amroha that 77 lakh un-electrified houses have been provided electricity
 lekin chunaav samaapt hone ke saath hi halke-halke isaki sachai saamne aane lagi he
 Most of the schemes run by the Modi government are buried in closed files and have failed to provide relief to the people
 graminon ko muft bijli conection dene vaali saubhaahgya yojana bhi puri tarah vifal rahi he
 Whereas PM Modi claims that electricity has been provided to every village in the country and electricity connections have been provided to millions of homes
 lekin ye sachai kuch or he
 India Today visited several villages of Khandauli in Agra, where around 100 connections were given under the Saubhagya scheme, but in the summer of June, the battery wings are still in use and there is no electricity
 gaanv waalon kaa kahana he ki unhen saubhaahgya yojana ke naam par ye kahkar unhen bevakoof banaaya gaya he ki power corporation bina bijli die hi hajaaron kaa bill bhej denge
 Most of the people of Panti Khera village have been electrocuted by cutting wires
 jabaki ye gaanv saubhaahgya yojana ke antargat aata he
 Jitendra Prasad, who lives in the village, said that 67 months ago a meter was installed outside his house, but he was not given a connection and no bill came
 dakshinanchal vidyut nigam limited ke ek karmchaaree ne india today ko bataaya ki saubhay yojana ke tahat ye kaam thekedaaron ko diya jaataa he or zyaadaatar thekedaaron ne aavedakon ke gharon ke baahar meter lagaae or uske photo die 
 But whether or not there was a meter, it was never checked
