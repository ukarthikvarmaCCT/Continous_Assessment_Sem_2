 modi ne do divasiy daure kii purv sandhya par aaj shaam kaha, 'vyaktigat rup se meri nepal yatra vishesh he
 
 is daure se kuch nijee bhavanaaen bhi judi hui hai
 The Prime Minister issued several tweets stating that Bahadur found him in a helpless position many years ago and has mentioned some of the conditions that followed
 modi ne twit kiya, 'kai varsh pehle jeet bahadur asahaay sthiti main mila tha
 He knew nothing of where to go, what to do
 vah kisi ko nahin jaanata tha na hi koi bhashaa samajhataa tha
 'he said,' i started thinking about him
 dhire-dhire usne padhane or khilne main ruchi dikhaai
 He also learned Gujarati language
 ' Modi said that sometime back he found the parents of Bahadur
 unhone twit kiya, 'yah isliye sambhav ho sakaa ki uske pair main chah anguliyaan hai
 The Prime Minister said, "thankfully, we were able to trace his parents
" main khush hum ki kal abhibhavak apane bete se milenge
 ' bahadur kaa puraa naam jeet bahadur magar he or uskaa parivaar pashchim nepal ke navalparsi jile ke kavasoti nagar nigam ilaake kii jhuggiyon main rahata he
 According to Nepali media reports, Bahadur, who is currently doing BBA in Ahmedabad, came to India in 1998 along with his brother in search of work like many other migrants from Nepal
 kuch samay tak usne rajasthan main kaam kiya
 After some time he decided to return to Nepal as he was not happy with his work
 media kii khabaron main bataaya gaya he ki rajasthan chhodte samay vah nepal kii seemaa se lagate uttar pradesh ke gorakhpur jane ke bajaae galati se ahmedabad jane vaali railgadee main savaar ho gaya
 On reaching Ahmedabad, a woman took him to Modi's house
 use samay tak modi gujarat ke mukhyamantri nahin bane the
 Bahadur was under Modi's care since then
 modi ke pradhanmantri banane or dilli chale aane ke baad bahadur vishvavidhyalay ke chatravaas main chalaa gaya
 According to media reports, the Prime Minister will meet four members of his family who have come to Kathmandu from his hometown Kavasoti
 uske parivaar ke sadasyon main uski maa khagisara, bada bhai dasharath, bhai kii patni or choti bahan prem kumari hai

 ' You must have seen the Hindi films often that when a hero gets hurt after suffering a head injury in an accident, his memory is lost
 use kuch yaad nahin rahata or hosh main aane par vah sabase pehla poochta he, 'main kahaan hum'
 But have you seen a person in real life whose brain gets hurt badly in an accident, but then he becomes a genius of maths
 ji haa, yah sach he
 This is the story of college dropout Jason Padgett, who was 31 years old 12 years ago and used to work in his father's furniture store, but the assault on him one night in Washington changed his entire life forever kept
 us raat jaisan ke dimag main gambhir chotein ain thim or ilaaj ke baad wo duniya ko ek alag hi nazariye se dekhne lage
 Once upon a time, a boy who was expelled from college was now in love with mathematics and physics
 medical jaanch ke dauraan pataa chalaa ki unhen sevent syndrome ho gaya he
 So far, there are only 40 people in the world who have this syndrome and Jason is one of them
 aapako bataa den ki is syndrome kii badaulat kabhi behad aam rahaa koi shaks brain injuri ke baad ganit, kala yaa sangeet kaa vidwaan ban jaataa he
 Jason has now penned his life experiences in the book 'streak by Genius: How a Brain Injury Made Me a Mathematical Marvel'
 13 sitambar 2002 kii raat jaisen kii jindagi us vakt puri tarah badal gai jab unke ghar ke paas ke ek baar main unke saath lutpaat kii gai
 Two miscreants attacked him from behind and punched the back of his head
 jaisan behosh ho gaye
 He was taken to the hospital, where he was treated for a bruise on his head due to injury
 usee raat unhen aspataal se chuttee bhi de di gai
 The next morning, when Jason woke up, he saw that his perspective of looking at things had changed
 ab ve un chizon par bhi gaur kar rahe the, jin par pehle unhone jaraa bhi dhyaan nahin diya tha
 She opened the tap in the bathroom and saw that the water was sharp and she was returning upwards after falling to the ground
 jaisan kehete hai, 'pehle to main bhuchakka rah gaya
 i started worrying about myself, but that view was so beautiful that i kept looking at it '
 ab jaisan ne kaam par janaa chhod diya or vah apana sara vakt ganit or physics padhane main bitaane lage
 He had no interest in painting before the accident, but now he started making geometric patterns and sometimes he would take weeks to finish his work
 lekin is tallent kaa ek kharaab pahalu bhi tha or vah yah ki jis jaisan ko ghoomana-phirana or doston ke saath mouj-masti karnaa acha lagata tha vah ab anrtmukhi ho gaya tha

 Delhi is so disturbed by the quarrel of BJP leaders that it is now looking to find a well-known face in search of a new face

 Another high profile name is that of Smriti Irani
 congress se shila dikshit, aam aadmi party se arvind kejariwal, lekin bijepi se koun
 The answer to this question is not even with the party itself, that is why the BJP, sitting in opposition for the last fifteen years, is still looking for a face that can cross its electoral mile

 In such a situation, there is pressure to field any high profile candidate in front of BJP
 lekin bijepi na to abhi tak dilli main siem pad ke liye ummidavaar tay kar paayi he or na hi siem ke khilaaf ummidavaar utaarne ke liye koi ummidavaar talash paayi he
 India Today Opinion poll also shows BJP leaders at number three and fourth in terms of choice for the post of Chief Minister
 aise main congress chutki le rahi he

 It is a very interesting coincidence that the Australia, which has defeated the Mahendra Singh Dhoni-led Indian team in every department of cricket in the last three months, now wants its crores to take on the same Australian team in Sri Lanka in the last league match of the tri-series
 Pray for victory cricket anischitataaon kaa khel he or uski baangi is shrunkhlaa main lagaataar dekhne ko mili he
 India have made the final league match of the tournament extremely interesting by achieving Sri Lanka's target of 321 runs in Hobart within 40 overs
 pehle yah match aupchaarikta-maatr hota, lekin ab yah bharat or srilanka ke liye semifinal jaisaa ho gaya he, or mjedaar baat yah he ki isamen bhartiya team ko khelnaa hi nahin he, balki uskaa bhagya australia ke pradarshan par nirbhar karegaa, jo pehle hi final main jagah bana chukaa he
 Australia have 19 points so far, while both India and Sri Lanka have 15 points each, but if the Australian team defeats Sri Lanka then the Indian team will reach the Best of Three Finals
 bhartiya khilaadi is match ko lekar kitne utsuk hai ki unhone abhyaas ke bajaae apni nazaren isi par gadaaye rakhane ko tarjeeh di he
 The comments bharat kii duaen kaam karti hai yaa nahin, yah kal match ke baad hi pataa chalegaa, lekin australia kii apni kuch pareshaaniyaan hai, jinka srilanka phayda uthaanaa chahega
 Australian captain Michael Clarke is still suffering from back pain and is doubtful to play tomorrow's match
 vah pehle bhi is vajah se kuch maichon main nahin khel paae the
 If Clarke is not fit, then all-rounder Shane Watson will lead the team, who bowled very well against India

 He was injured during the Sydney Test match against India in January

 On the other hand, the morale of Sri Lanka, which has continuously improved its performance till the crushing defeat against India, has shaken

 viraat kohli ne unke khilaaf jis tarah kaa aakraamak ravaiya apanaaya, usase ab anya ballebaaj bhi unako khulkar khilne kaa saahas dikhaaenge
 The good news for Sri Lanka is that the aggressive batsmen Tillakaratne Dilshan and Kumar Sangakkara, who failed to play big innings before Hobart, scored centuries and they can play an important role again
 bharat ne hobart main srilanka kaa 321 ran kaa lakshya 40 over ke andar hasil karke toornament kaa aakhri lig match behad dilachasp bana diya he
 Earlier this match would have been a formality, but now it has become a semi-final for India and Sri Lanka, and the funny thing is that it is not only the Indian team that has to play in it, but their fate will depend on the performance of Australia, which already Has made it to the finals
 australia ke ab tak 19 ank hai, jabaki bharat or srilanka donon ke 15-15 ank hai, lekin yadi australian team srilanka ko haraa detii he to bhartiya team best aaf thri finels main pahunch jaaegi
 How keen are Indian players about this match that they have preferred to keep their eyes on it instead of practice
 tippaniyan Whether India's prayers work or not, it will be known only after the match tomorrow, but Australia has its own problems, which Sri Lanka would like to take advantage of
 australian captain maaikel clark ab bhi peeth dard se pareshaan hai or unka kal ke match khelnaa sandigdh he
 He did not play some matches earlier because of this
 yadi clark feet nahin hote to phir olerounder shen watasan team kii aguwai karenge, jinhone bharat ke khilaaf bahut acchhee gendbaaji kii thi
 Fast bowling sensation James Pattinson has also recovered from a foot injury
 vah janvari main bharat ke khilaaf sidney test match ke dauraan chotil ho gaye tha
 Fast bowling leader Brett Lee is also not fully fit, but he wants to play despite the pain
 duusari taraf bharat ke khilaaf karaari haar se pehle tak lagaataar apane pradarshan main sudhaar karne vaale srilanka kaa manobal hilaa hua he
 Before Sri Lanka surrendered at Hobart, Sri Lanka was expected to make it to the finals, but now tomorrow's match has become a 'do or die'
 srilankai gendbaajon ne hobart ke match se pehle tak acha pradarshan kiya tha, lekin pichley match main gendbaajon ne use niraash kiya
 His star bowler Lasith Malinga 12

 With the aggressive attitude Virat Kohli took against him, now other batsmen will also show him the courage to play freely

 Last week, there were two reports of donations to political parties
 patrkaar rohinee singh kii khabar 'da vir' main chhapi ki bijepi ko un teen companiyon se 20 karod kaa chanda mila he jinke khilaaf idi yani pravartan nideshaalay teror funding ke maamle main jaanch kar rahi he
 The BJP has given the names of these companies in its report
 jaanch agency idi aarkedablyoo limited ke khilaaf is baat kii jaanch kar rahi he ki company ne 1993 main mumbai bam dhamaakon ke aaropee ikbaal mirchi kii sampatti kharid kii prakriya main shaamil rahi ek duusari company kii madad kii thi, jiske badale iske purv nideshak ranjit bindra ko kathith taur par 30 karod kaa kamishan mila tha
 Iqbal Mirchi was close to Dawood Ibrahim
 is company ne 10 karod kaa chanda bijepi ko diya he jisaki jaankaree bijepi ne chunaav ayog ko di he
 This information was disclosed by Cobrapost in January this year
 rohinee ne apni report main likhaa he ki agar 2014-15 main elactoral bond kaa kanoon aa jaataa to pataa hi nahin chalata ki kis company ne kitna paisa diya he
 Two more companies are mentioned in this report
 aap 'di vir' par jaakar puri report pard sakate hai
 There was no concrete response from the BJP after this report came out
 chuppi saadh lee gai
 It should be seen that which party this company has donated
 lekin jab khoji patrkaar nitin sethi ne chah kadiyon main nae elactoral bond ko lekar apni report prakashit kii tab piyush goyal ne lanbaa sa jawaab likhit or maukhik taur par diya
 This report of Nitin Sethi should be read to understand the electoral bond and if you read Hindi newspapers then read it more carefully and see what such reporting happens in Hindi newspapers? After all, why is the courage of this kind of reporting coming out of the Hindi world, when there are only one capable journalist
 nitin sethi mul rup se angrezi main likhte hai magar unki chah report kii series hindi main news laundry kii website par chhapi he
 You know that till now 6000 crore electoral bonds have been bought and money has come to political parties
 ediaar kii report ke anusaar march 2018 main kharide gaye 222 karod ke bond main se 95 fisadi paisa bijepi ke khate main gaya he
 The first report by Nitin Sethi is quite alarming
 elactoral bond ke liye shuru main jo concept note bana wo kisi adhikari ke letters pad par nahin balki sade kagaz par bana
 Neither the date was on plain paper nor the signature of anyone
 purv adhikariyon ne is kagaz ko dekhakar bataaya he ki baahar se kisi ne likhaa he or isaki bhashaa adhikariyon kii nahin lagati he
 On February 1, 2017, Arun Jaitley was to present the budget, four days before the opinion is sought from the Reserve Bank
 tab ke rajasav sachiv hansmukh adhiya ke jawaab ke anusaar tab tak vitt vidheyak kii copy chap chuki thi
 Nevertheless, the Reserve Bank makes several objections to the electoral bonds, which are ignored
 rigerv bank kii aapatti gopneeyata ko lekar thi to jawaab mila ki daan dene kii gopneeyata iskaa uddeshy he
 Four days before presenting the budget, a senior tax officer sees some flaws
 yahi ki elactoral bond se bade corporation apni pahchaan chhipate hue aseemit dhan raajnneetik dalon ko de sakate hai
 This can only be possible when the Reserve Bank of India Act changes
 usee din vitt mantralay reserve bank ke dipti governor ko email bhejkar twarit tippanee maangata he
 On 30 January 2017, the Reserve Bank states that amendments to its act will start a wrong tradition
 mani londring bad jaaegi
 The money will belong to a third party and someone else will buy
 isse paardarshita kaa lakshya puraa nahin hoga
 The debate of such complex processes on TV is difficult
 bahut si baaten dhyaan se utar jaati hai
 Yet you understand that the Reserve Bank is saying that there is no transparency in this
 vidheyak pesh karne se chaar din pehle usase raay lee jaati he
 Ideally, such a subject could be consulted even earlier, when the Finance Bill was not printed
 zaahir he raay lene kii aupchaarikta nibhaai ja rahi thi jo ab is report se ujagar ho chuki he
 Note in this report the reply of the Ministry of Finance
 yahi ki bond jari karne vaale bank ise kharidne or praapt karne vaale dal kii jaankaree puri tarah gupt rakhenge
 This will be excluded from the purview of RTI
 to phir yah paardarshita kaise ho jaati he? 1 farvari 2017 ko vitt mantri ke rup main arun jetali elactoral fund kaa elaan karte hai or yah kanoon ban jaataa he
 After enactment of the law, a meeting of the Election Commission and the Reserve Bank is called, which excludes the Reserve Bank
 bond paas hone ke baad ab videshi companiyaan bhartiya dalon ko chanda de sakati hai
 Any company can donate any amount of money
 is bond kii vaidhata ko supreme court me chunauti di gai or antim nirnay nahin aayaa he
 Nitin Sethi has raised the question that why foreign companies were allowed to secretly give donations? Nitin Sethi has presented documents in support of everything in his report
 ab to sabhi dastavezon ko public ke liye uplabdh kara diya gaya he
 For free, that is, anyone can check whether the questions raised by Nitin Sethi are correct or not? Transparency is called this
 patrakarita main aisi paardarshita kam dikhaai detii he ki ek patrkaar apane saare dastauez saarvajanik kar de
 This bond also has a dangerous aspect
 sirf sarkaar ko pataa he ki koun company kise chanda de rahi he
 If the government put pressure on the opposition party to stop the donation? After all, what is the motive behind hiding the identity of the donor? Then when Mohammed Nadeemul Haq was asked in the Rajya Sabha whether anyone had lodged an objection to the electoral bond, then Minister of State for Finance Radhakrishnan said that the objections were not lodged, while Nitin Sethi in his report proves that objections were lodged Were
 rigerv bank or chunaav ayog kii taraf se
 Later, when the RTI Commodore Lokesh Batra collected the objections through RTI, the questioning MP, Haq filed a case of violation of the privilege, but even then the Minister of State for Finance remained firm on his earlier reply
 jabaki dastauez saamne he
 Both the Reserve Bank and the Election Commission objected
 sansad main elactoral bond paas ho jane ke baad chunaav ayog ne likhit rup main kanoon va nyaay mantralay se kaha tha ki elactoral bond ke zarie raajnneetik dalon kii videshi sorce se avaidh chande ko chhipaane main madad milegi
 The shale that offers dubious donations will form companies and divert black money to political parties
 paisa kaa sahi strot kabhi saamne nahin aayega
 The commission wanted the electoral bond to be withdrawn
 kanoon mantralay ne in aapattiyon ko vitt mantralay ke paas bheja
 The Ministry of Finance ignored
 phir bhi aktubar 2018 ke ant tak chunaav ayog elactoral bond ko waapas lene kii baat karata rahaa
 Many reminders were also sent for this, but the Finance Ministry ignored it
 iske baad bhi vitt rajya mantri sansad main kehete hai ki kisi ne aapatti nahin kii
 In January 2019, Minister of State for Finance Radhakrishnan had to admit a mistake in his earlier reply
 baad main vitt mantri nirmala sitaraman ne mana ki chunaav ayog ne aapatti darj kii thi, lekin unhone saansad haq ke is sawaal kaa jawaab nahin diya ki sarkaar ne un aapattiyon ko dur karne ke liye kya kiya? is baat ko dhyaan main rakhie ki koi company kitna bhi chanda de sakati he or kise degi kitna degi, iskaa hisaab apane bahikhaate main darj nahin karegi
 It is not necessary for him to do so
 aakhir companiyaan jab apana ek-ek paisa sebi jaisi sansthaaon ko bataati hai to apane paise se kise chanda diya yah kyon nahin bataaengi? ise gupt kyon rakhaa ja rahaa he? kya kaala dhan safed karne ke liye aisa kiya ja rahaa he? nitin sethi ne apni report main jo dastauez pesh kiye hai unhen dekhne se yahi lagata he ki vitt mantralay lagaataar sabhi aapattiyon ko khaarij kar rahaa he
 There is no concrete action on the possibility that anyone can donate any amount by creating a fake company? Piyush Goyal held a press conference after Nitin Sethi's report
 unhone apana bayaan likhit rup main bhi jari kiya
 The claims made by Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal in last Thursday's press conference have been questioned in the Huffington Post report
 jaise unhone kaha tha ki 15 dinon ke bheetar bond ko cash karana padataa he, lekin may 2018 main karnataka vidhansabha chunaav khatm hone ke baad 10 karod kaa bond laps kar gaya
 So a representative of a political party pressured the State Bank to allow the bonds to be cashed
 vitt mantralay us dabaav ke aage jhukaa
 Nitin Sethi has shown in his report that ten days before the election, an order comes from the Prime Minister's Office to open a window and cash the bond
 sawaal vahi kaa vahiin he ki chanda dene vaale kaa naam jab gopneey he tab yah paardarshee system kaise hua? 2 may 2017 ko vitt mantri arun jetali ne vipakshi dalon se is par raay maangi thi
 Motilal Bora wrote on behalf of the Congress, 'I understand that the government is concerned about the issue of transparency on the electoral funding of political parties
 paardarshita kaa taatpary he ki matadaata ko teen baaten pataa honi chahie
 Who is a donor? Two, which political party is being donated and what is the amount of three donations? Motilal Vora also said that the name of the donor will be known by the bank, ie the government, but not the general public

 Legendary batsman Sachin Tendulkar believes that on a tough tour to England, India will take the field with the best pace attack after many years
 sachin ne kaha ki bharat ke paas philhal sabase purna tej gendbaaji atake he jo antarrashtriya cricket main unke 24 saal ke kariyar ke dauraan kabhi nahin hua
 India will begin their nearly three-month UK tour with two T20 internationals against Ireland from 27 June but all eyes are on the 5-match Test series starting in Birmingham from 1 August
 tendulkar ne pitiai se kaha, ‘kai varshon main yah bharat kaa sabase purna tejagendbaaji akramanhai
 According to my assessment this attack would be one of the best
 ’apane kariyar ke dauraan 200 test khilne vaale tendulkar ne kaha ki bharat ke paas kuch achche tej gendbaaj rahe hai, lekin itani vividhta vaala akraman uske paas kabhi nahin rahaa
 Tendulkar said, 'we are in a good position where we have a swing bowler (bhuvneshwar Kumar), a tall bowler (ishant Sharma), an exact bowler (jaspreet Bumrah) and a really fast bowler (umesh Yadav)
 'bharat kii gendbaaji kaaphi majbootatendulkar ne kaha ki itani sari vividhta ke saath yah acha sangyojan he
 Tendulkar has played with fast bowlers like Kapil Dev and Manoj Prabhakar
 is diggaj ballebaaj ke kariyar ke adhikansh hisse main javagal shrinath or jahir khan bharat ke tej gendbaaji akraman ke agua rahe
 When asked if this attack was more efficient than the attack in his time, Sachin said, 'yes, i am speaking in his (the attack of Tendulkar's career) also because there is a reason for it
 hamaare paas bhuvi he, jo ballebaaji bhi kar saktaa he or saath hi hardik bhi jisamen acchhee ballebaaji karne kii kshamta he
 Tendulkar did not comment on which combination India should play
 unhone kaha, ‘mujhe lagata he ki team prabandhan ko akalan karnaa hoga ki virdohi team kakoun sa ballebajkisi tarah kii gendbaaji ke khilaaf sahaj he
 There are some who handle swing bowling well and some have the technique of handling balls moving from the pitch
 aapako in sab par dhyaan dete hue team kaa chayan karnaa hota he
 Tendulkar, who has scored the most runs in Test and ODI cricket, while praising Bhubaneswar, said that he can strengthen India's position with his all-round ability
 unhone kaha, ‘bharat kii maujuuda team lagaataar aise tej gendbaajon par dhyaan de rahi he jo balle se bhi acha yogadan de saken
 i think these two players (bhuvneshwar and Hardik) continue to contribute runs
 ’bhuvi kii jamkar tariftendulkar ne kaha, ‘hardik ne abhi team main jagah banaai he lekin mujhe lagata he ki bhuvi ne shandaar yogadan diya or isse team kaa santulat sakaaratmak rup se badla
 He said, "it is good to have a batsman who can bowl four to five overs, but it is better to have a bowler who can score important runs
 aisa yogadan jo aapako aage badhane main madad kar sake
 'tendulkar was a part of five Test series in England (1990, 1996, 2002, 2007 and 2011) and is well aware of England's weather and pitches
 unhone kaha, ‘mujhe lagata he ki wicket achche honge
 It also depends on how the heat is getting there
 koi bhi barish or thande halaat main nahin khelnaa chahta
 i am looking forward to a good summer that is conducive to good cricket
 ’sachin ne kaha ki ek cheez hi bharat ke paksh main ho sakati he vah yah he ki test siries kii shuruyaat agast main hogi or tab tak bharat england main ek maheene kaa samay bitaa chukaa hoga
 He said, 'I think going early will prove to be a beneficial situation

 This will help the team to get into rhythm

 haryana kii jind or rajasthan kii ramgarh vidhansabha seat par hue upachunaav ke nattejey aaj ghoshit kiye ja rahe hai
 In both the seats, the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party have a tough fight
 jind main upachunaav hue hai jabaki rajasthan ke ramgarh main ummidavaar ke nidhan ke kaaran tab baaki siton ke saath chunaav nahin ho sake the
 The speed with which the parties have shown this and the power shown in the election campaign, it is clear that the parties and its leaders will not take the results lightly
 # Haryana: Congress's Randeep Surjewala and Jannayak Janata Party's Digvijay Chautala present at the counting centre in # Jindas counting of votes has begun

 com / mt9ppyjzap— ANI (@ANI) January 31, 2019 Congress has fielded its elder leader Randeep Singh Surjewala from Jind
 maheene-do maheene main loksabhaa chunaav hone hai, lihaaja partiyaan apni apni jeet ko kila fatah se jodengi or iskaa sidhaa sambandh dilli ke takht-o-taj se joda jayega
 Jind was the first to talk
 yahaan 28 janvari ko upachunaav hue
 Seeing the crowd gathered in the voting, it can be guessed that what will happen in the Lok Sabha when there is such enthusiasm in the assembly
 seat kaa byoraa dekhen to jind nirvachan kshetra main 1
 There are 7 lakh registered voters out of which about 50 per cent of the Scheduled Castes (SC) and Backward Classes (obcs)
 jaaton kaa lagbhag 25 pratishat vot he
 Currently, this seat is occupied by the Indian Lok Dal
 haal ke maheenon main congress ne jis prakaar se bijepi ko agadi jatiyon, amiron, udyogpatiyon se joda he or essi, asti, obisi ko lubhaane kii koshish kii he, usase spasht he ki congress ko jind se kaaphi ummiden hai
 That's when he has brought his media in-charge and MLA from Kaithal Randeep Surjewala to Jind
 haalanki yah ladaai itani aasaan nahin he kyonki yah inelo kii shartiya seat rahi he
 Yet the Congress is witnessing its own victory and the defeat of INLD in the bjp's anti-incumbency wave
 yah upachunaav isliye bhi ahm he kyonki is saal haryana main vidhansabha chunaav honge or jeet-haar kaa sameekaran jind se sidhaa jodakar dekha jayega
 It can be said that this by-election is a litmus test for all four parties ruling BJP, Congress, INLD and newly formed party Jananayak Janata Party (JJP)
 surajevaala kaa daanv thodaa baari lag rahaa he kyonki unhone pehle inelo supremeo om prakaash chautaala ko haraaya tha
 Despite all these factors, the JJP is considered a 'kingmaker' as the INLD and the Congress know that the JJP will cut its votes
 iskaa takneekee pahalu ye he ki aam aadmi party ne apana koi ummidavaar to nahin utaara lekin jejepi ko samarthan diya he
 Aam Aadmi Party's image in Delhi adjoining Haryana is good, so according to experts it may get good votes
 yahaan achche vot se sandarbh bijepi, congress or inelo ke kate voton se he
 Arvind Kejriwal also went to the election campaign and sought votes for JJP candidate Digvijay Chautala
 inelo ke vidhayak doctor harichand midhdha ke nidhan ke kaaran yah upachunaav chunaav hua he
 There are a total of 21 candidates in the fray but the contest is between 4 candidates
 bijepi kii ore se krishna midhdha pratyaashee hai
 His father Harichand Midha was an MLA from here
 ab baat rajasthan main hue ramgarh upachunaav kii
 Voting on this seat was first scheduled to take place on 7 December 2018 but was postponed after Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) candidate Laxman Singh passed away before the election
 chunavi maidan main 20 ummidavaar hai lekin asli ladaai congress kii safia jubair khan, bijepi ke sukhvant singh or basapa ke jagat singh ke bich he
 Rajasthan has the highest number of farmer voters and the Congress has won their hearts by waiving debt in the recent assembly elections, so its pan appears to be heavy
 haalanki uskaa jat factor kamjor he
 Congress does not have any Jat face that has influence in its constituency, whereas in Rajasthan the Jat voter is effective and vocal
 ramgarh ke nattejey par bhi iskaa asar dekhne ko mil saktaa he
 The plus point with the Congress is that in the recent assembly elections, it got bumper votes and the BJP government kept going
 199 siton main congress ko 99 mili or uski sahyogi party rashtriya lokdal ko ek seat
 The BJP was reduced to 73 seats here
 6 vidhayak basapa ke or 13 nirdaleey jite
 All these mlas have supported Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot
 yah samarthan ramgarh ke upachunaav par asar daal saktaa he

 About ten thousand children were present in the program, including the director of the educational institution
 jain muni ne bacchon ko sanskaaravaan shiksha kaa mahatv bataaya or mata-pita kii seva kar punya arjeet karne kii baat bhi kahi

 This journey will take us to the threshold of the legislature, passing through the stages of bureaucracy, implementation, monitoring
 ham khud ko sansad yaa vidhansabha ke daravaaje par khadaa paaenge, jahaan se kanoon nikalate hai
 How successful governments are in a democracy depends on how well thought out and visionary their laws are
 jaahir he ki kanoonon kii gunvattta vidhayikaon kii kushalta par nirbhar he yani hamaare kanoon nirmaataaon—saansad-vidhayakon kii kaabiliyat par
 Two fresh examples force us to think on the state of legislative efficiency in India
 pehla he inasolvency or bankerptsi (diwaliyapan) kanoon, jisamen ek saal ke bheetar hi adhyadesh ke jariye bada badlaav karnaa padaa he
 The law, which came into effect from December last year, brought in modern, speedy legal process for restructuring of sick companies and recovery of outstanding bank loans
 yah sudhaar nivesh ke maahaul ko sthaayee banane or bank karj kaa durupyog rokane liye jaruri tha
 Due to this law, India's ranking in business ease has improved recently
 kanoon lagu hote hi sarkaar ko pataa chalaa ki iskaa to beja phayda uthaaya ja saktaa he or uskaa rajnatik nuksaan ho saktaa he isliye ab ise sir ke bal khadaa kar diya gaya
 The debate continues as to how much work is left of banks and companies and how the process of debt recovery and restructuring of sick companies will continue after this
 sanshodhan par takneekee bahes se zyada bada mudda yah he ki sirf ek saal main itane bade badlaav kii jarurat kyon padi? desh main biimaar companiyon se nibatane vaale kanoonon (sika act, company kanoon, sarafesi act, karj ugaahi tribunel) kaa itihaas or is tarah ke maamalon ke paryaapt anubhav hai lekin iske baad bhi ham ek achook bankerptsi kanoon kyon nahin bana sake?doosraa namoona he jiesti vidhaayi kushalta kii haalat kaa
 GST has also been in place for almost a decade to reduce the burden of taxes on consumers and industry, make the tax system easier and more taxpayers can come under the tax net
 lekin banane ke teen maah ke bheetar hi jiesti dhwast ho gaya
 The tax rates were reversed and the rules changed so much that it became difficult to remember them
 jiesti kii vifaltaa ne bharat ke indirect tex dhaanche ko gahari chot pahunchaai he
 There is also no shortage of experience regarding indirect tax
 waite or sarvice tex lagu ho chuke hai
 It took time to implement VAT i
e
 Value Added Tax but it proved more sustainable than GST
 jiesti kii jaruratein or chunautiyaan puri tarah spasht thim
 There was also political consensus, but even after a long wait, our law makers were not able to give us a single GST
 kanoonee or nitigat vifaltaaon kii fehrist lambii ho sakati he jo vidhayika kii dakshata par uthne vaale sawaalon ko or vyapak bana degi
 Such headship (GST, Bankruptcy) of newly enacted laws is unique due to electoral pressures
 jo sansad kanoon banaati he vah in badlaavon par jab tak vichaar kare tab tak bahut der ho chuki hoti he
 Legislative inefficiency is increasing in India
 taaja anubhav hamen chaar nishkarsh dete hai:1
 The government is not doing enough research before enacting the law, otherwise the GST and the Bankruptcy Code would not be present
 2
 There is no communication with the parties affected by the law
 rajaneta swayan ko sarvajna maanate hai
 3
 sansad main kanoonon par bahes itihaas ban chuki he
 Half-baked laws are passed on the forehead of the public after the majority is passed by the Parliament
 4
 Bad laws turn into disputes and then the government feels that the courts are crossing their limits
 doordarshita kanoonon kii pehali jarurat he
 Repeated changes in them prove their weakness
 jab hamaari sansad hamen ek saal tak tik paane vaale kanoon nahin de paa rahi he to rajyon kii vidhansabhaon main kaise kanoon ban rahe honge
 The more dangerous the laws are, the greater the problems with bad law
 durbhaagya se hamaare paas donon hai

 Arun Jaitley, died on 24 August at the age of 66 after a long illness

 His first chamber was his father's office in Chandni Chowk area of old Delhi
 madhyavargeey parivaar se aane vaale yuva kii ek bahut saadhaaran shuruyaat, satta ke asaadhaaran sopanon tak pahunchi
 His influence in politics becomes even more remarkable by the fact that he has never been a 'mass leader' nor has he worked as an ideological guardian of his party like the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh activist like many of his colleagues in government Progressed while doing
 unke prabhaav or unki takat main samay ke saath lagaataar ijapha hota gaya

 He was the only one of the leaders of his generation who in 1989-90 V

 In Singh's government, he was able to get a big position like Additional Solicitor General
 isane unke kanoonee kariyar ko badi chalaang di
 For many years, it was Arun Jaitley who used to draft proposals for meetings of the National Executive of the Bharatiya Janata Party
 televijan par or rajyasabha main kisi bhi mudde ko bhaajapa ke paksh main ghuma dene kii unki adbhut kshamta kii prashansa unke kai rajnatik pratidwandvi bhi kiya karte the
 Jaitley made friends in every business, every field and every category because of his courteous behavior
 unke mitra galat vajahon se bhi charchaa main rahe par unki vyaktigat pratishtha par kabhi aanch nahin ai
 Strong economic fortifications When Jaitley became finance minister in the first term of the Modi government in 2014, he inherited a decaying economy
 unhone jo sabase ullekhneey badlaav kiye unamem se ek tha—lamabandi karne waalon ko north block ke galiyaaron tak simit kar dena
 In the early days, he was in charge of defense, finance and corporate affairs
 us samay, bharat dohare ghate kii samasya se jujh rahaa tha—chaalu khaataa ghaataa or rajkoshiya ghaataa bahut adhik tha
 Inflation was close to double digits and many scams hurt India's economic credibility globally
 jetali ne vitt mantri ke rup main apane pehle varsh main rajkoshiya niti ko durust karke or us par tike rahakar kuch vishwasaneeyata phir se behaal kii
 He endorsed a new approach to streamline the system of distribution of government benefits, and his best approach is best reflected in the Direct Benefit Transfer Scheme

 The anti-corruption agenda of the government was heavily supported by the Jaitley-led Finance Ministry
 kaale dhan ke khilaaf yuddh—emnesti skim se lekar vivaadaaspad notebandi tak—unke mantralay kii dekharekh main chalaa
 He was one of only three people aware of the Prime Minister's plan to close around 86 percent of India's currency in November 2016
 unhone modi sarkaar kii ek or mahatvapurn tathaa lambey samay se lambit yojana maal or seva kar (jiesti) ko aage badhaayaa
 He institutionalized the monetary policy framework — a reform that made the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) process of setting interest rates more transparent
 jetali ne bharat ke pehle diwaliyapan kanoon—insolvency and bankerpsi code kii shuruyaat kii or doshapurn rinon kii vasuuli tathaa divaaliepan kii karrwai ko samaybaddh tareeke se puri karne kii koshish kii gai
 Critics say that Jaitley's obsession with reforms had increased excessively
 jawaab main, unhone 2016 main india today ko bataaya tha, ‘‘aap akhabaaron main bade dhamaakedaar lekh de sakate hai, lekin jahaan tak sudhaaron kaa sawaal he, unamem vidhaayi or gaiyr-vidhaayi kadam shaamil hai
 No single step can improve the entire economy

 When, in an interview in June 2017, India Today asked him what he found most praiseworthy among the party leaders, he said, "I saw Advani's best political efficiency in the 1990s

 unki abhivyakti adwitiya thi
 Speaking of Modi, no one can get better than him as Prime Minister

 ’’jetali main bhi kai saraahneey gun the
 He was the voice of logic in the national television world of venom and personal attacks and one of the handful of people who stood firm for the modi-shah duo
 unhen swasth bahes pasand thi
 At the India Today Conclave in March 2019, Jaitley said that India had both a 'compulsive contradictory' and a 'nawab of negativity' in a fair amount
 unhone kaha, ‘‘mujhe lagata he ki kisi bhi loktantr main hamen unhen apni jagah deni hogi anyathaa loktantr ubaau ho jayega
 They knew each other from the days of Jayaprakash Narayan's (JP) agitation against Indira Gandhi and the Emergency (1975-77) but Modi's exile in 1995 as a result of Shankarsinh Vaghela's rebellion in Gujarat
 Given, at that time there was an intimacy between Jaitley and Modi
 agle saal, jab pramod mahajan ne mumbai se loksabhaa chunaav ladgaye kaa faisla kiya or unhen media ko sanbhaalane kaa kaam saunpa gaya, to donon ne saath milakar kaam kiya
 Both performed well
 jetali modi ke gujarat ke mukhyamantri ke rup main shuruaati dinon se lekar pradhanmantri banane tak har maamle main unke salaahkaar the
 He handled Modi's legal hurdles in the 2002 Gujarat riots cases and outlined his political and media strategy in the three assembly elections Modi fought in the state between 2002 and 2012
 modi ne dilli ke apane dinon main ek bhrasht or bhai-bhatijavadi lutiyans kii dilli ko puri shashan-vyavastha kaa galaa ghontate dekha tha
 Jaitley was his ideal partner for Modi as PM when he planned to eliminate that maze, who, despite being part of the same Delhi government, kept himself completely untouched by its mess
 jo log modi-jetali ke sambandhon se waakif hai, ve yaad karte hai ki jetali ne chunaav ayog ke us nae niyam, jo loksabhaa pratyaashiyon ko namakan patr main vaivaahik sthiti kii ghoshnaa ko anivaary banaata tha, kaa adhyayan karne ke baad na jane kitne vakeelon ke saath kitni baithken kin or uske baad modi ko 2014 ke chunaavon main vadodara se chunaav ke liye bhare gaye namakan form main apni shaadi kii ghoshnaa karne kii salaah di thi
 Modi separated from his wife 50 years ago, but legally he never ended the marriage

 The association of the two was very strong
 ’’ satyanishtha se lekar prakruti ke prati unke prem tak par, bhagat jetali se jude kai kisse sunaate hai
 Jaitley has an 18-year-old relationship with Gujarat as he represented the state till 2018 as a Rajya Sabha MP
 jetali kaa gujarat ke saath sambandh 1990 ke dashak kii shuruyaat main tab shuru hua tha jab unhone vadodara ke gaekwad shahi parivaar ke liye gujarat ucch nyaayalay main mukademe lade the
 Bhagat says, "arunji was a rich man of faith

 According to a live science report by medical resident Won Jin Ho of Case Western Reserve University, Ohio, the study has revealed that women who have the highest lycopene in their diet have a lycopene level equivalent to those who eat four tomatoes a day

 Due to this, the color of these fruits is light redness
 yah adhyayan rajonivrutt ho chuki kareeb 92 hajaar mahilaon par kiya gaya

 or to or purv mukhyamantri or 10 janpath ke qaribiyon main gine jane vaale bhupinder singh huda ne to apana ballat khaali hi chhod diya
 The three Congress votes Anand got were Kiran Chaudhary and Kuldeep Vishnoi and his wife Renuka Vishnoi, who recently merged their party in the Congress
 gauratlab he ki ek din pehle hi haryana pradesh congress vidhayak dal kii baithak hui thi jisamen rajyasabha ke liye kis ummidavaar ko samarthan diya jaae is par charchaa hui
 During this, RK Anand also reached Congress headquarters in search of support
 sielpi main congress kii parampara ke mutabiq ye faisla liya gaya ki faisalaa congress alaakaman par chhodte hai
 Then the message was given that the Congress would go with RK Anand
 lekin andarkhaane congress kii duvidha bahut gahari thi
 While RK Anand was an inld-backed candidate, Subhash Chandra had BJP support
 aise main congress ke ek bade netaa ne ek kahawat sunai ki maano ek kamare main ek saanp or ek jat band ho gaya ho or unamem se ek kaa maranaa tay ho
 But the problem is that if we are locked in the same room then where will we be saved
 congress agar voting se dur bhi rahati to wo subhash chandra kii jeet tay kar detii or bijepi ke saath jaati dikhaai padati
 This would have been detrimental to the secular image of the Congress
 phir bache aarake anand
 But what work did RK Anand Congress do? rajyasabha pahunchane vaale vakil netaaon kii congress ke paas pehle se bhi kami nahin thi
 And it is RK Anand who has been the advocate of PV Narasimha Rao in the JMM bribe case
 wo raav jo kabhi 10 janpath ko nahin bhaae
 Well then it was different
 aarake anand baad main congress ke sahare hi rajyasabha bhi pahunch gaye
 There were also two factions in Haryana Congress regarding RK Anand
 ek naveen jindal kaa jo anand ko sirf isliye chahta tha taaki apane kattar dushman subhash chandra kaa rasta roka ja sake
 The battle between the two is well known in the coal mine case
 zee news kii taraf se camere par 100 karod kii ugaahi kaa sting oparation or phir zee patrkaar kaa jail janaa aadi sabane aag main ghi daalaa
 Jindal even fought to the point that even the license of Zee News came on
 naam tak badalanaa padaa
 But at the same time, Congress leader and former Chief Minister of the state Bhupinder Singh Hooda was always swayed by Subhash Chandra
 kehete hai ki dushman kaa dushman dost hota he
 Hooda is not made up of Naveen Jindal and Naveen Jindal's enmity with Subhash Chandra

 Many Congress leaders also remember the days when Subhash Chandra was considered close to Rajiv Gandhi
 haalanki ve baad main alag ho gaye lekin phir alag hone kaa afsos bhi jataayaa
 a senior Congress leader even said in an informal conversation that the doors of 10 Janpath are always open for Sushabha Chandra

 But the compulsion in front of Subhash Chandra was that how would he forward his lota in front of Congress on the same ghat where he was drinking water with BJP

 Now the question is why the Congress snatched food even after placing a plate in front of RK Anand
 jawaab sidhaa sa he
 What does RK Anand have to avenge the favor of Congress and what does Subhash Chandra have
 aarake anand ke paas vaqaalat kii qabiliyat he jisapar bmdablyoo cese maamle main sting kaa dank lag chukaa he
 In that sting of NDTV, when RK Anand was found guilty in court, then the Congress expelled him from the party
 kuch congressi ye bhi yaad kar bataate hai ki nikaale jane se naaraaz aarake anand ne sidhe 10 janpath par sawaal uthaae the
 This can also be seen as an argument against Anand

 The question was also whether Subhash Chandra announced the line of BJP and Modi
 to chandra ke chaahane waalon ne use is tark se kaata ki chandra kii naaraazgi jindal kii vajah he
 And because they have entered politics, they also know that there is no permanent friend or permanent enemy in it
 kai congressiyon kii nazar main chandra apana rukh badalane ke liye jane jate hai
 Apart from the media, Subhash Chandra has many businesses for which he has to keep pace with the power
 tippaniyan Whatever the reasoning within the party, the result of the election is enough to tell that the Congress wanted Chandra
 nahin to khud purv mukhyamantri ne to ballat khaali choda hi, ol india congress kamity ke media chairman randeep singh surajevaala jo ki rahul kii team main bhi shumaar maane jate hai, kaa vot bhi radd ho gaya
 Now whatever technical explanation comes on it, but it is not the case that all these Congress mlas were voting for the Rajya Sabha for the first time that a mistake was made
 aane vaale dinon main do baton par nazar rahegi
 If the Hooda camp revolts, then the Gandhi family will crack down on them
 rahul gandhi ke khaas main shumaar ho chuke surajevaala kii sthiti kamazor hogi
 If he is going to get the post of General Secretary in Team Rahul then he will not get it
 media cell ke chairman pad se hataa diya jayega
 And accordingly the other mlas will also be beaten
 ye sahi he ki gandhi parivaar kii khud kii sthiti abhi itani dawandol he ki koi bhi kuch bhi suna ke nikal jaataa he

 But no one can question the 'integrity' of Bhupinder Singh Hooda, blessed with 10 Janpath and Surjewala having access to 11 Tughlaq lanes
 aarake anand ko lekar haryana congress main bhi do dhada tha
 a Naveen Jindal who wanted Anand only to stop the path of his arch enemy Subhash Chandra
 koyala khan maamle main donon ke bich kii ladaai jagazahir he
 The sting operation of extortion of 100 crores on camera from Zee News and then going to jail of Zee journalist, all added fuel to the fire
 jindal ne to yahaan tak ladaai ladi kii baat zee news ke license tak par aan padi
 Even had to change the name
 lekin vahiin congress ke kaddavar netaa or rajya ke mukhyamantri rah chuke bhupinder singh huda kii subhash chandra se hameshaa se chhanati rahi
 It is said that the enemy of an enemy is a friend
 hooda kii naveen jindal se nahin banati or naveen jindal kii subhash chandra ke dushmani
 So in this way another point of friendship is added
 congress ke kai netaa un dinon kii bhi yaad dilaate hai jab subhash chandra rajeev gandhi ke nazadikiyon main gine jate the
 Though they later separated, but again expressed their regret of separation
 congress ke ek bade netaa ne anaupchaarik baatcheet main yahaan tak kah diya ki sushabh chandra ke liye das janpath ke darvaaze hameshaa khule hai
 They can meet whenever they want
 lekin subhash chandra ke saamne kii majaburi ye thi ki jis ghat par ve bijepi ke saath pani pi rahe the usee ghat par ve congress ke saamne aapnaa lotaa kaise aage karte
 However, sources said that Chandra was in touch with close to 10 Janpath leaders
 jaankaree ye bhi ai ki subhash chandra kii pairvi karne amar singh 6 yaa 7 taarikh ko khud rahul gandhi se milane pahunche
 The Congress or Rahul Gandhi's office did not approve of this
 ab sawaal he ki aakhir congress ne aarake anand ke saamne thali rakh kar bhi khaanaa kyon chin liya
 The answer is simple
 aarake anand ke paas congress ke ehsaan kaa badla chukaane ke liye kya he or subhash chandra ke paas kya
 RK Anand has legal capacity, which has stinged in the BMW case
 enditivi ke us sting main jab court main aarake anand doshi paae gaye the to uske baad congress ne unhen party se nikaal baahar kiya tha
 Some Congressmen also recall that angry RK Anand directly questioned 10 Janpath because of the removal
 ye baat bhi anand ke khilaaf tark ke taur par dekha ja saktaa he
 Subhash Chandra, on the other hand, has a wide media network
 sawaal ye bhi tha ki subhash chandra to ghoshit taur par bijepi or modi kii line lete hai
 So Chandra's fans cut him off with the argument that Chandra's heartburn is the reason for Jindal
 or kyonki ve raajnneeti main kadam rakh chuke hai to ve bhi jaanate hai ki isamen koi permanent dost yaa permanent dushman nahin hota
 Chandra is known to change his stand in the eyes of many Congressmen
 media ke alaava subhash chandra ke kai bijness hai jiske liye unhen satta ke saath talmail bitha kar chalanaa padataa he
 The comments party ke bheetar ke tark vitark chaahe jo bhi rahe hon, chunaav kaa parinaam ye bataane ko kaaphi he ki congress ne chandra ko hi chaha
 Otherwise, the former Chief Minister himself left the ballot empty, the vote of Randeep Singh Surjewala, the media chairman of All India Congress Committee, who is also considered as one of Rahul's team, was also canceled
 ab is par takneekee safai jo bhi aae lekin aisa nahin he ki congress ke ye tamaam vidhayak pehali baar rajyasabha ke liye vot kar rahe the ki galati ho gai
 In the coming days, two things will be watched
 agar jo huda kheme ne baghaavat kii to gandhi parivaar un par nakel kasega
 The position of Surjewala, who has been included in Rahul Gandhi's special, will be weak
 agar team rahul main unako mahasachiv kaa pad milane vaala he to wo nahin milegaa
 The Chairman of the Media Cell will be removed
 or tadnusaar duusare vidhayakon par bhi gaaj giregi
 It is true that the condition of the Gandhi family itself is so turbulent that anyone can hear anything
 lekin 10 janpath se aashirwad praapt bhupinder singh huda or 11 tughlaq len tak pahunch rakhane vaale surajevaala kii ‘integrity’ par koi sawaal nahin uthaa saktaa
 But at the same time, Congress leader and former Chief Minister of the state Bhupinder Singh Hooda was always swayed by Subhash Chandra
 kehete hai ki dushman kaa dushman dost hota he
 Hooda is not made up of Naveen Jindal and Naveen Jindal's enmity with Subhash Chandra
 to aise main dosti kaa ek or sira judata he
 Many Congress leaders also remember the days when Subhash Chandra was considered close to Rajiv Gandhi
 haalanki ve baad main alag ho gaye lekin phir alag hone kaa afsos bhi jataayaa
 a senior Congress leader even said in an informal conversation that the doors of 10 Janpath are always open for Sushabha Chandra
 ve jab chahen mil sakate hai
 But the compulsion in front of Subhash Chandra was that how would he forward his lota in front of Congress on the same ghat where he was drinking water with BJP
 haalanki sutron ne bataaya ki 10 janpath ke qareebi netaaon ke saath chandra tach main the
 Information also came that Amar Singh came to meet Rahul Gandhi himself on 6th or 7th to defend Subhash Chandra
 congress yaa rahul gandhi ke daftar ne is baat kii tasdik nahin kii
 Now the question is why the Congress snatched food even after placing a plate in front of RK Anand
 jawaab sidhaa sa he
 What does RK Anand have to avenge the favor of Congress and what does Subhash Chandra have
 aarake anand ke paas vaqaalat kii qabiliyat he jisapar bmdablyoo cese maamle main sting kaa dank lag chukaa he
 In that sting of NDTV, when RK Anand was found guilty in court, then the Congress expelled him from the party
 kuch congressi ye bhi yaad kar bataate hai ki nikaale jane se naaraaz aarake anand ne sidhe 10 janpath par sawaal uthaae the
 This can also be seen as an argument against Anand
 duusari taraf subhash chandra ke paas lanbaa chaudaa media network he
 The question was also whether Subhash Chandra announced the line of BJP and Modi
 to chandra ke chaahane waalon ne use is tark se kaata ki chandra kii naaraazgi jindal kii vajah he
 And because they have entered politics, they also know that there is no permanent friend or permanent enemy in it
 kai congressiyon kii nazar main chandra apana rukh badalane ke liye jane jate hai
 Apart from the media, Subhash Chandra has many businesses for which he has to keep pace with the power
 tippaniyan Whatever the reasoning within the party, the result of the election is enough to tell that the Congress wanted Chandra
 nahin to khud purv mukhyamantri ne to ballat khaali choda hi, ol india congress kamity ke media chairman randeep singh surajevaala jo ki rahul kii team main bhi shumaar maane jate hai, kaa vot bhi radd ho gaya
 Now whatever technical explanation comes on it, but it is not the case that all these Congress mlas were voting for the Rajya Sabha for the first time that a mistake was made
 aane vaale dinon main do baton par nazar rahegi
 If the Hooda camp revolts, then the Gandhi family will crack down on them
 rahul gandhi ke khaas main shumaar ho chuke surajevaala kii sthiti kamazor hogi
 If he is going to get the post of General Secretary in Team Rahul then he will not get it
 media cell ke chairman pad se hataa diya jayega
 And accordingly the other mlas will also be beaten
 ye sahi he ki gandhi parivaar kii khud kii sthiti abhi itani dawandol he ki koi bhi kuch bhi suna ke nikal jaataa he
 But no one can question the 'integrity' of Bhupinder Singh Hooda, blessed with 10 Janpath and Surjewala having access to 11 Tughlaq lanes

 sawaal ye bhi tha ki subhash chandra to ghoshit taur par bijepi or modi kii line lete hai
 So Chandra's fans cut him off with the argument that Chandra's heartburn is the reason for Jindal
 or kyonki ve raajnneeti main kadam rakh chuke hai to ve bhi jaanate hai ki isamen koi permanent dost yaa permanent dushman nahin hota
 Chandra is known to change his stand in the eyes of many Congressmen
 media ke alaava subhash chandra ke kai bijness hai jiske liye unhen satta ke saath talmail bitha kar chalanaa padataa he
 The comments party ke bheetar ke tark vitark chaahe jo bhi rahe hon, chunaav kaa parinaam ye bataane ko kaaphi he ki congress ne chandra ko hi chaha
 Otherwise, the former Chief Minister himself left the ballot empty, the vote of Randeep Singh Surjewala, the media chairman of All India Congress Committee, who is also considered as one of Rahul's team, was also canceled
 ab is par takneekee safai jo bhi aae lekin aisa nahin he ki congress ke ye tamaam vidhayak pehali baar rajyasabha ke liye vot kar rahe the ki galati ho gai
 In the coming days, two things will be watched
 agar jo huda kheme ne baghaavat kii to gandhi parivaar un par nakel kasega
 The position of Surjewala, who has been included in Rahul Gandhi's special, will be weak
 agar team rahul main unako mahasachiv kaa pad milane vaala he to wo nahin milegaa
 The Chairman of the Media Cell will be removed
 or tadnusaar duusare vidhayakon par bhi gaaj giregi
 It is true that the condition of the Gandhi family itself is so turbulent that anyone can hear anything
 lekin 10 janpath se aashirwad praapt bhupinder singh huda or 11 tughlaq len tak pahunch rakhane vaale surajevaala kii ‘integrity’ par koi sawaal nahin uthaa saktaa
 Now the question is why the Congress snatched food even after placing a plate in front of RK Anand
 jawaab sidhaa sa he
 What does RK Anand have to avenge the favor of Congress and what does Subhash Chandra have
 aarake anand ke paas vaqaalat kii qabiliyat he jisapar bmdablyoo cese maamle main sting kaa dank lag chukaa he
 In that sting of NDTV, when RK Anand was found guilty in court, then the Congress expelled him from the party
 kuch congressi ye bhi yaad kar bataate hai ki nikaale jane se naaraaz aarake anand ne sidhe 10 janpath par sawaal uthaae the
 This can also be seen as an argument against Anand
 duusari taraf subhash chandra ke paas lanbaa chaudaa media network he
 The question was also whether Subhash Chandra announced the line of BJP and Modi
 to chandra ke chaahane waalon ne use is tark se kaata ki chandra kii naaraazgi jindal kii vajah he
 And because they have entered politics, they also know that there is no permanent friend or permanent enemy in it
 kai congressiyon kii nazar main chandra apana rukh badalane ke liye jane jate hai
 Apart from the media, Subhash Chandra has many businesses for which he has to keep pace with the power
 tippaniyan Whatever the reasoning within the party, the result of the election is enough to tell that the Congress wanted Chandra
 nahin to khud purv mukhyamantri ne to ballat khaali choda hi, ol india congress kamity ke media chairman randeep singh surajevaala jo ki rahul kii team main bhi shumaar maane jate hai, kaa vot bhi radd ho gaya
 Now whatever technical explanation comes on it, but it is not the case that all these Congress mlas were voting for the Rajya Sabha for the first time that a mistake was made
 aane vaale dinon main do baton par nazar rahegi
 If the Hooda camp revolts, then the Gandhi family will crack down on them

 And accordingly the other mlas will also be beaten
 ye sahi he ki gandhi parivaar kii khud kii sthiti abhi itani dawandol he ki koi bhi kuch bhi suna ke nikal jaataa he
 But no one can question the 'integrity' of Bhupinder Singh Hooda, blessed with 10 Janpath and Surjewala having access to 11 Tughlaq lanes

 Rashtriya Lok Dal president Ajit Singh has said that even though the Allahabad High Court may settle the litigation related to the disputed site of Ayodhya, it will not resolve the Ayodhya dispute
 singh ne kaha, ‘adaalat vivaadit bhoomi par swaamitv kaa maamla tay kar sakati he magar vivaad kaa samaadhaan nahin kar sakati
 He said that whatever the decision of the court, the matter will go to the High Court
 singh ne baharhaal 24 sitambar ko ayodhya par aane vaale faisle ke maddenjar utpann hone vaali sthiti ke bare main puche jane par kaha, ‘mujhe nahin lagata ki is baar 1992 jaisi sthiti paidaa hogi

 dilli main privet skool sarkaar ke management cote ko khatm karne ke aadesh ke khilaaf dilli hoicourt pahunch gaye hai
 The High Court will hear the petition of private schools on Thursday i
e
 today
 gauratlab he ki management kota khatm kiye jane par privet skool naaraaz hai
 Nursery Admission: 298 Private Schools Can Go to Court! Let it be said that it has been more than a decade but still no way has been reached between the private schools and the government regarding nursery admission, so that there is no permanent way of nursery admission Can find a way out
 balki pichley 3 -4 saal se ye or ulajh gaya he
 This year, the Delhi government removed the notification and set guidelines for nursery admission and the action committee of private schools has filed a petition challenging the notification of the Delhi government in the High Court
 nursery admician: dilli main 298 privet skulon main khatm hua management kotaaj aa saktaa he faislahai court is yachika par aaj sunwaayee karegaa
 In fact, while taking the land from DDA, it was said that schools should give priority to the children of those areas for admission
 skulon kaa kahana he ki wo pehle se hi daakhile main nebarhud criteria ko tavajjo dete rahe hai lekin agar sibling, elumanai jaise duusare criteria ko puri tarah nazarandaaj kar diya gaya to skool or abhibhavak donon kii mushkilen bad jaaengi
 But the government wants private schools to compulsorily admit children of the Neighborhood to the 75% open seat
 sarkaar ke isi faisle ko skulon ne dilli hai court main chunauti di he
 In the rape case, the difficulties of accused Maharaj are not diminishing
 dilli hai court main peedita kii taraf se lagaai gai yachika par buudhvaar ko sunwaayee karte hue is maamle ko jaanch ke liesibiaiko transfar kar diya he
 Actually, the court did not appear satisfied with the recently filed chargesheet by the Delhi Police
 isiilie sibiai ko is maamle main supplementry chargeshit daayar karne ke aadesh die gaye hai
 Questioning the chargesheet in the court, the police said that the testimony of more than 4 dozen women in this case has been recorded at their home
 mumkin he ki daati maharaj ne bayaan darj hone ke baad unako daraane dhamkaane kii koshish bhi kii ho
 The court's question was that when the victim had recorded her statement in 164, then why Dati Maharaj was not arrested in this case yet
 peedita kii taraf se is maamle mendaati maharajake khilaaf balaatkaar kaa maamla dilli police main darj karavaaya gaya tha
 The victim said that in January and March 2016, she was raped by Dati Maharaj
 peedita ne apni exiaar main paanch or logon ko bhi balaatkaar kii ghatana main daati maharaj kaa sahyog karne or shadyantr rachane kaa aaropee banaaya he
 Now that the Delhi High Court has transferred the case to the CBI in this case, the CBI will have to do a full investigation again
 jaanch karne ke baad sibiai ko apni chargeshit dilli hai court ko saupani hogi
 It will also be clear from the CBI investigation that there have been some flaws and shortcomings in the investigation of Crime Branch of Delhi Police till now
 pichley hafte dilli police nedaati maharajako mukhya aaropee bataate hue balaatkaar ke aarope main saket court main apni chargeshit daayar kar di
 But the biggest question raised by the High Court is why Dati Maharaj could not be arrested despite so many allegations so far
 mumkin he ki sibiai jaise jaise apane jaanch ke daayre ko badhayen daati maharaj kii giraftaar bhi sambhav ho
 The victim alleged that Kidati Maharaj had close ties with many big leaders and bureaucrats and hence her arrest in the case has not been done yet
 bhartiya janata party (BJP) ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah (amit Shah) ne loksabhaa chunaav se thik pehle bada elaan kiya he
 He has said that leaders who are over 75 years of age in the party will not be given any responsibility
 ravivaar ko dilli main 'bharat ke man kii baat' abhiyaan kaa aagaaj karte hue amit shah ne modi sarkaar ke kaarykaal main kiye gaye vikaas kaaryon kaa bakhaan karte hue yah baat kahi
 In fact, through this campaign, BJP workers will put 7 thousand boxes across the country and opinions will be sought from about 10 crore families
 in pariwaron se poocha jayega ki vah kaisaa bharat chaahate hai or phir unki raay ko chunavi sankalp patr main shaamil kiya jayega
 Starting this campaign in Delhi on Sunday, Amit Shah praised the internal democracy of the Bharatiya Janata Party, and also gave a statement on the aged leaders for the upcoming Lok Sabha elections
 unhone kaha ki jo netaa 75 saal kii umr ko paar kar chuke hai, unhen kisi prakaar kaa kaam karne kii jimmedaari nahin di jaaegi
 However, when he was asked whether such leaders would be able to contest the upcoming elections or not, he did not give a clear answer and asked to be discussed
 bataa den ki umr seemaa ko lekar pehle bhi amit shah ke hawaale se chunaav ladane par pabandi kii khabaren aati rahi hai
 However, later, bypassing such discussions, leaders above 75 years of age were also given tickets
 lekin yah masalaa vidhansabha chunaav se judaa tha
 Now that Lok Sabha elections are going to be held, in such a situation, this statement of Amit Shah is being considered very important
 bhartiya janata party main is vakt laalkrishna adwani, murali manohar joshi, shanta kumaar, kariya munda, liladhar waghela or prabhaat singh chouhan samet kai aise saansad hai, jo philhal loksabhaa sadsy hai or unki umr 75 ko paar kar chuki he
 In such a situation, if the party takes any decision to contest the election of leaders above the age of 75 years, then these names can also be seen in that list

 Raju Srivastava, a well-known comedian known as 'gajodhar' and a Samajwadi Party (SP) candidate from Kanpur Lok Sabha seat, returned the ticket on Tuesday
 unhone party bhi chhodane kaa elaan kar diya, haalanki sapa ne daawa kiya he ki unka tikat kaate jane kaa faisla pehle hi ho gaya tha
 The party has replaced Surendra Mohan Aggarwal, Advisor, Commercial Tax Department and Chairman of All India Industry Trade Delegation, from Kanpur
 iske alaava kanpur mahanagar kii sapa ikai bhi tatkaal prabhaav se bhang kar di he
 Raju Srivastava told that Netaji (mulayam Singh) made him a candidate a year ago
 vah chunaav prachaar kar rahe the lekin sthaneey netaaon ke sahyog na karne se vah kanpur main vah akele pad gaye the
 The sp's Kanpur unit was opposing him
 har jagah upeksha kii ja rahi thi
 Raju alleged that the local leaders of the organization did not cooperate despite the chief minister Akhilesh Yadav and SP state president Akhilesh Yadav saying
 unhone kaha, 'mujhe tikat milane se kuch netaa khud ko asurakshit mahasoos kar rahe the
 ' aisa lagata he kisenadhyaksh general ve ke sinhaneayu gatirodhper pehle daur kii kanoonee ladaai jeet lee he kyonkisupreme courtne shuukravaar ko kaha ki jis tareeke se unki vaidhanik shikaayat ko khaarij kiya gaya he vah ‘durbhaavna se grast lagata he
 While deciding the next hearing of the matter on 10 February, the court wanted to know whether the government would like to withdraw its order of 30 December 2011
 raksha mantri e ke antnine 30 disambar ko ek aadesh jari kiya tha jisamen general singh kii us vaidhanik shikaayat ko khaarij kar diya gaya tha jisamen kaha gaya tha ki sena ke ricard main unki janmatithi ko 10 may 1950 nahin balki 10 may 1951 mana jaae
 a bench of Justice RM Lodha and Justice HL Gokhale raised questions on the government
 peeth kaa maananaa tha ki raksha mantralay kaa 21 july 2011 kaa vah aadesh atorni general kii raay par aadhaarit tha jisamen janmatithi ko 10 may 1950 mana gaya tha
 Along with that the case was also based on his (attorney General's) opinion when the order was passed on 30 December on a statutory complaint
 jab court ne poocha ki kya sarkaar 30 disambar kaa apana aadesh waapas lenaa chaahegi atorni general ji i vaahnavati ne kaha ki vah is mudde par sarkaar ke nirdesh praapt karenge
 The court said that if the government withdraws its order of 30 December, then other measures are available before General Singh
 court ne kaha ki us sthiti main 21 july ke aadesh ke khilaaf general singh kii vaidhanik shikaayat par praadhikariyon dwaara pun:vichaar kiya ja saktaa he tathaa iske alaava unke paas sashastr bal nyaayaadhikaran main jane kaa vikalp bhi he
 During the hearing, the bench said that when it was said that General Singh's complaint was not considered, he had no option but to come to the Supreme Court
 peeth ne shuru se hi sarkaar kii nirnay lene kii prakriya par prashn khadaa kiya
 The bench said that we are not as concerned about the decision making process as it is about malfeasance because the order of July 21 was given considering the opinion given by the Attorney General
 jab 30 disambar ko senadhyaksh kii ore se di gai vaidhanik shikaayat par nirnay kiya gaya tab atorni general kii raay par bhi vichaar vimarsh kiya gaya
 The bench further said that the contents of the record do not fit the principle of natural justice and law
 atorni general or solicytor general rohinton nariman ne sarkaar ke kadam kaa bachaav kiya or kaha ki tathyon par general singh ke prati koi purvaagrah nahin bartaa gaya he
 On the court's order, Puneet Bali, a lawyer for General Singh, said that he was certainly pleased with the order but would not go to the merits of the case as the matter is still under consideration
 unhone kaha ki court kii ore se mukhya prashn yah uthaaya gaya ki jis praadhikari ne general singh kii vaidhanik shikaayat ko khaarij kiya usne apana nirnay atorni general kii salaah par aadhaarit kiya jinhone purv main sarkaar ko salaah di thi ki vah 21 july ke apane aadesh main antim nirnay kare
 Bali told the media not to make too much sense of it and said that it is normal practice for the court to raise questions

 (input-bhashaa) Just a year before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, BJP is going to give a big blow to former Congress president Sonia Gandhi
 sonia gandhi ke sansadeey kshetra raibareli se congress emelsi dinesh pratap singh ne apane puure parivaar ke saath party ko alavida kah diya he
 On Sunday, he will join the party in the presence of BJP President Amit Shah and Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath
 jile ke jiaaisi maidan main kaarykram kii taiyaari chal rahi he
 In the fort of Congress, the BJP intends to realize its power by gathering a crowd of one lakh people
 raibareli se congress kaa ek bada khemaa bijepi main shaamil ho rahaa he
 Several Zilla Panchayat members and several dozen Panchayat members, including MLC Dinesh Pratap Singh and District Panchayat President Awadhesh Pratap Singh, will join BJP
 jabaki unke ek bhai harchandrapur se vidhayak rakesh pratap singh congress kaa saath nahin chodenge
 Dinesh Pratap Singh while talking to Aaj Tak said that Sonia Gandhi has considered Rae Bareli as a private limited
 raibareli nehru-gandhi parivaar ke liye enjoy karne kii jagah ban gaya he
 He said that the top leadership of the party is doing feticide of Congress workers in Rae Bareli
 dinesh singh ne kaha ki raibarelikabhi congress kaa majboot garh nahin rahaa he
 Here people vote for Sonia Gandhi and not the Congress party
 raibareli main congress jab khud ladati he to use 10 se 20 hajaar se zyada vot nahin milte hai
 In Rae Bareli, Sonia does not win anyone but the MP, MLA, MLC and Panchayat chief
 unhone kaha ki sonia gandhi ke alaava jab kabhi koi congress kaa yahaan se chunaav ladaa he to use 50 hajaar se zyada vot nahin mil paaya
 Therefore, we cannot call it a Congress stronghold
 jabaki vahiin lakhanu ko dekhie atal bihari vaajapeyi aaj vah bhale hi lakhanu se chunaav nahin lard rahe hai
 If any BJP contests there, it wins
 ise garh kaha jaataa he
 He said that Rae Bareli has always been called the stronghold of the nehru-gandhi family
 lekin ise kabhi congress kaa garh nahin banaaya gaya balki ise gandhi-nehru khandaan kaa ghar banaaya gaya
 In Rae Bareli, the party was made a private limited
 dinesh singh ne congress par aarope lagaate hue kaha ki raibareli kii mitti par jile ke kaaryakartaaon kii bhrun hatya ho rahi he
 This is the top leadership of the Congress of feticide, which we cannot tolerate
 unhone kaha ki congress netritv jis bhi party ke kaaryakarta kii shahadat lenaa chaahati he wo le leti he
 Dinesh Singh said that i have never won due to the Congress
 agar koi yah kah de ki maine congress kii badaulat yah jeet hasil kii he to main aaj hi istipha dene ko taiyaar hum
 He said that in my victory, the head of the village and people who have won from all the parties are involved, Congress has no role in this
 unhone kaha kiryabareli kii mittico jahaan sammaan milegaa vahi dinesh singh ja rahaa he
 That is why we are going to BJP now
 unhone kaha ki amit shah ji hamen jwine karaane raibareli nahin aa rahe hai balki main khud hi unhen raibareli bulaane gaya tha
 They are coming at my invitation, i met him in Delhi
 dinesh singh ne kaha ki amit shah ji raibareli ko sammaan dilaane or vikaas kii raah par le jane ke liye aa rahe hai
 He is not coming to Rae Bareli to break the Congress, which he thinks is wrong
 bijepi ke logon ko saath lekar raibareli kii seva karuunga
 It will be my endeavor that the people of the district should understand Amit Shah better than Sonia Gandhi in Rae Bareli
 unhone kaha ki ham sonia gandhi ke samanaantar raibareli kaa vikaas karenge
 i will develop here together with BJP
 jile ke vikaas ko lekar sonia gandhi se compitishan karenge, aise main agar ham acha karenge to ham raibareli jeetenge or agar wo behatar karengi to wo jeetengi
 Dinesh Singh said that we have faith in the honesty of Yogi ji and Modi ji
 sonia gandhi ko haraane kii baat nahin kah rahaa hum balki ham modi ji ke liye ek or seat kaa intjaam kar rahe hai
 That is why i am working that next time when the BJP government is formed, Rae Bareli should stand with them
 dinesh singh ne kishori laal sharma par hamalaa karte hue kaha ki sonia gandhi ke ek prabharee hai jo ludhiana se aate hai, congress use apana kaaryakarta banaati he jo 5 vot bhi naa dilaa saktaa
 i do not need to break the Congress workers
 We have won the public opinion of Rae Bareli, so the public is with us, not the workers

 The Jan Sankalp rally held in Gandhinagar after the Congress Working Committee meeting in Gujarat is being seen as the beginning of the Congress campaign for the Lok Sabha elections
 is raily se priyanka gandhi wadra ne bataur mahasachiv pehali baar congress kaaryakartaaon ko sambodhit kiya or bijepi ke rashtrawaad ke samaksh deshbhakti kii nai paribhaasha gadhane kii koshish kii
 So at the same time Prime Minister Narendra Modi through the blog reminded the people of the country that Mahatma Gandhi wanted to dissolve the Congress after independence
 aagaamee loksabhaa chunaav main congress kii ranneeti gandhi-sardaar kii dharti se modi-shah kii jodi ko chunauti dene kii he
 The day of the meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC), the most powerful decision-making body in the party in Gujarat, was chosen on March 12, the day the Father of the Nation Mahatma Gandhi launched the Civil Disobedience Movement through the Dandi March
 isse pehle yah baithak 28 farvari ko honi thi, lekin pulavama hamale ke baad bhartiya vayusena kii javaabi karrwai ko dekhte hue congress ne is baithak ko sthagit karnaa hi munasib samajha
 Challenging modi-shah from the land of gandhi-sardar, there is a lot of emphasis on challenging Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP Congress President Rahul Gandhi and UPA President Sonia Gandhi at their home in amethi-rae Bareli
 to vahiin congress party bhi piem modi or bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ko unke garh gujarat main gherne kii kavayad main juty he

 in se baatcheet main kaha ki pichley vidhansabha chunaav main hi party ne tay kar liya tha ki gujarat main congress ko or majboot karnaa he
 To some extent we also succeeded because we almost reached the BJP in the assembly elections
 isi ke saath party ne narendra modi ke gaanv vadnagar kii vidhansabha main bhi jeet hasil kii
 Lalji Desai said that Gujarat is the land of Mahatma Gandhi and Sardar Patel whose message rests on love, goodwill and sacrifice
 jabaki narendra modi or shah kii jodi par satta kaa nasha sir chadhakar bol rahaa he
 Desai said that BJP specializes in resources, money and election management, but the general public is plagued by their policies
 pichley loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ne gujarat kii sabhi 26 siton par kabja jamaaya tha, lalji desai kaa kahana he ki congress party is baar 16 loksabhaa siten jeetne kaa lakshya rakhaa he
 'gandhi wanted to dissolve Congress' On the one hand, while the Congress party was starting its election campaign from the soil of Gujarat, on the other hand, Prime Minister Narendra Modi told the country through his blog that Mahatma Gandhi wanted to dissolve the Congress
 
 piem modi ne mahatma gandhi ke vichaaron or congress kii samskruti ke virodhabhas kaa ullekh karte hue congress par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki sabase bhayanak jatigat dange or dalit-virdohi narsanhaar congress ke shashan main hue
 The Prime Minister said that Gandhiji understood the culture of the Congress very well, and that is why he wanted to dissolve the Congress, especially after 1947
 rashtrawaad banaam deshbhakticongress kaarysmiti kii baithak ke baad gandhinagar main hui jan sankalp raily main priyanka gandhi wadra ne kaha ki aagaamee loksabhaa chunaav aazaadee kii ladaai se kam nahin he
 Priyanka appealed to the Congress workers and said that awareness is the real patriotism
 priyanka ne kaha ki jahaan se gandhi ji ne prem or sadbhaavna or ahimsa kii aawaaj uthaai thi, main sochati hum ki yaheen se aawaaj uthni chahie
 Without naming Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Priyanka Gandhi said that those who talk about their nature in front of you, tell them what is the nature of this country
 desh kii fitrat he ki jarre-jarre main sachai dhundhakar nikaalegi
 It is the nature of this country that the voice of hate will be transformed into love and compassion
 ye aawaaj aap yahaan se uthaaie
 
 
 
 log aaj bhi pahachaanate hai haath kaa nishanisse pehle congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi 14 farvari ko gujarat ke valsad jile main jansabha sambodhit kar chuke hai
 But unfortunately Rahul's rally took place on the day of the Pulwama attack
 congress party ke liye valsad jile kaa laldungri gaanv vishesh mahatv rakhata he
 Because it was from this village that Indira Gandhi in 1980, Rajiv Gandhi in 1984 and Sonia Gandhi in 2004 started campaigning and gained power
 congress party kaa maananaa he ki yahaan kii janata aaj bhi haath ke nishaan ko pahachaanate hai or indira gandhi ko yaad karte hai
