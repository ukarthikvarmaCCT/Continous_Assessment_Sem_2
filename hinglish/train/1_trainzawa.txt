 Amid growing escalation of ceasefire violations along the indo-pakistan international border in Jammu and Kashmir, the Pakistan Rangers chief spoke to BSF Director General DK Pathak on the phone and requested that the Indian side stop the retaliatory firing
 sutron ke anusaar paak rangers ke mahanideshak major general umr farak burki ne biguef pramukh se kaha ki biguef kii javaabi karrwai se unhen bahut baari nuksaan hua he or biguef ko golibari band kar deni chahie
 Pathak told his Pakistani counterpart that if Pakistan does not fire, there will be no action from India
 sutron ke mutabik rangers ke mahanideshak ne aaj shaam ko biguef pramukh ko donon pakshon ke bich nai shuru hui hotline seva par phone kiya or anurodh kiya ki seemaa par golibari rokkar aman-chaiyn sunishchit kiya jaae
 Ceasefire violations are being repeatedly carried out by Pakistani soldiers from October 23
 unhone kaha, ‘donon paksh golibari rokane par sahamat ho gayi, lekin biguef ne spasht kiya ki agar uksaave vaali karrwai hui to ve jawaab denge
 ' rasookh kaa vichaar utana hi purana he jitna ki jeev-jantuon kii prajatiyon kaa itihaas
 It is a matter of dominance, influence and motivation and is never weighed on the idealistic scale of morality

 Wealth and intelligence, and the extraordinary ability to turn every crisis into opportunity, separate them from us
 unke liye kai naam hai: shaktishaalee kuleen varg, hakimon kaa tabaka, satta shikhar aadi
 They do not have to be desirable
 unke vichaar or unki manovriti hameshaa janhit se mail nahin khaati
 His power overshadows his concept
 unka asar unke chune hue kshetra tak simit nahin hota, chaahe vah bordroom ho yaa newsroom, khel kaa maidan ho yaa cinema kaa paradaa, chauraahaa ho yaa adaalat

 In a country like India, the dominance of these upper-class people does not only explain the collapse of that trilogy, but it also indicates that ahead of it
 us pyramid ne ek khaas myne main vyavastha ko paribhaashit kiya thah sattadhari varg, sena or kaarobaar
 That order can only be maintained in an autocratic system of governance where the three cannot be separated from each other under any circumstances
 jis duniya main rashtriya gaurav kaa sanketak chhavniyon kaa aakaar nahin, bazaar kii swatantraaa ho, or jahaan rajnatik satta nirankush na hokar janamanas ke rujhaan par ashrith ho, vahaan chand thilishah hi chotii par lagaataar bane rahete hai
 India is part of the same mood world

 Despite the worst political and economic conditions, the fastest-growing people in the market are at the top of the game
 jab 2003 main pehali baar power list bani tab bhartiya arthvyavastha pehle hi license raaj kii zanjeeron ko tod chuki thi or usne 6 fisadi vikaas dar ke kalank ko peeche chhodte hue oochaal ke yug main pravesh kiya
 Not only this, it also touched a magical growth rate of 9 percent

 Five years later, when elections were held, she was able to retain her power

 iske baavjood, hamaari suchi main shaamil bazaar ke diggaj kyon muskaraa rahe hai? yah darasal takat kaa istemaal he
 It also shows the limits of political power, unlike the enthusiasm of the entrepreneurial class
 shashan kaa kam kaam karnaa kaarobaar ke liye thik he, lekin kharaab shashan use nasht kar saktaa he
 The courageous and ambitious entrepreneurs of the Indian business class are breaking boundaries and setting up businesses in distant markets, even as the government is doing nothing to restore confidence in India as Asia's next miracle
 yahi vajah he ki bazaar ke sabase taqatvar log dridhtaa se tike hue hai
 It is a livelihood to live and work in a place where the government is absorbing oxygen

 Political power is predictable and does not make India such an interesting, perhaps the most entertaining place

 This gives some glimpse of the rise of India's soft power

 Despite this, in a controversial society like India, the power of thinkers should be more than today because the political class is losing its ideology

 The people of this elite club can no longer consider their privilege as their fiefdom
 satta main lambey samay tak vahi bane rahete hai jo vichaaron kaa behatar istemaal karte hai, or 21veen sadi ke bharat main badlaav ke sarvottam vichaar raajnneeti ke baahar milte hai
 The caravan of powerful people being given on the next pages reflects the changing system of an India that has been plunged into despair by its government, yet some courageous people with a sense of victory keep it alive

 Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar has resigned from his post

 Angry NCP ministers after Ajit Pawar's resignation have also submitted their resignations to state NCP chief Madhukar Peachad
 vahiin, khabar aa rahi he ki buudhvaar ko vidhayak dal kii baithak ke baad is puure masale par antim faisla liya jayega
 At the same time, after this news, all the NCP mlas were angry that now the Maharashtra government should support from outside

 On this occasion, the CM gave a statement in the Assembly that in the last ten years, the government will come out with a white paper on spending money
 jaankaar yah kah rahe hai ki siem ke is bayaan ke baad ensipi ne congress par yah dabaav banaaya ki vah ajit pavaar ke kaarykaal ko is daayre se baahar kar de lekin siem nahin maane
 After resigning on Tuesday, Ajit Pawar said that he had done no wrong
 unka kahana he ki vah ab maatr emele hai or tab tak koi mantri pad grahan nahin karenge jab tak vah puri tarah se ghotaale ke aaropon se bari nahin ho jate
 The comments raajnneeti ke jaankaar maan rahe hai ki ensipi ne yah soch-samajhakar chaal chali he
 Some Congress-led ministers in Maharashtra have also been accused of corruption and have not resigned yet
 kaha ja rahaa he ki ab congress party par bhi dabaav he ki vah apane cote ke mantriyon se istipha le
 It is noteworthy that the state school education minister Rajendra Darda has also been accused in the coal scam and he has neither resigned nor the party has demanded his resignation

 bataa den ki 1999 se 2009 tak ajit pavaar ke paas hi sinchai mantralay rahaa he
 Even after 2009, Sunil Tatkare, close to Ajit Pawar, was given this charge
 is dauraan maharashtra main sinchai par 70 hajaar karod rupee kharch kiye gaye lekin kathith rup se maatr ek fisadi hissaa hi sinchai ke kshetra main joda ja sakaa he
 Tension arose in the Congress and NCP governments amid opposition uproar
 is maukey par siem ne vidhansabha main bayaan diya tha ki pichley das saal main kharch rupayon par sarkaar shwet patr ke saath saamne aegi
 Experts are saying that after this statement of CM, NCP put pressure on Congress to exclude Ajit Pawar's tenure from this purview but did not accept CM
 istipha dene ke baad mangalvaar ko ajit pavaar ne kaha ki unhone koi galat kaam nahin kiya he
 He says that he is now only MLA and will not assume any ministerial position until he is completely acquitted of the scam charges
 tippaniyan Politicians are assuming that the NCP has done this thoughtfully

 Pandey scored fifty runs in just 27 balls
 jab yah saajhedaari khatarnaak hoti dikhne lagi, tabhi rajasthan ke captain steve smith ne behtareen kaich lapakkar warner kaa khel khatm kiya

 bhartiya railway main group si ke tahat assistant loko payalat (ALP) or technician kii bhartee kii jaani he, jisaki pehle charan kii pariksha 9 agast se shuru ho jaaegi
 For selection in Group c examination, one has to pass through four stages
 pehle or duusare charan main computer besd test jabaki tisare charan main computer besd aptitude test hoga or chauthe charan main document veriphication kaa kaam hoga
 Let's know what is the complete exam pattern
 
 
 kaise hoga salectioncystant loko payalat ke padon ke liye pehle or duusare charan ke tahat computer besd test (CBT) kii prakriya se guzarana hoga
 Only the candidates who are successful in the first CBT will be called for the second CBT
 pehle or duusare sibiti se technishyan ke padon par aavedan karne vaale ummidavaaron ko bhi guzarana hoga
 Those applying for Assistant Loco Pilot will have to undergo Computer Based Aptitude Test (AT) after passing both cbts
 Railway bhartee: aisa hoga group si pariksha kaa paper, dekhen- patternaisa hoga paperpahale charan kii pariksha main 75 bahuvikalp prashn honge
 General candidates will be given 1 hour to take the exam and disabled candidates will be given 80 minutes for this
 pariksha paas karne ke liye general category ke ummidavaaron ko 40 pratishat ank praapt karnaa jaruri he
 Those who do not pass this test will not be valid for the next stage
 chaatro ko yah dhyaan rakhana hoga ki har galat uttar par 1 / 3 negative marking hogi
 Now there is very less time left in the exam, in such a situation, candidates should speed up their preparation and for this it is very important to make the right strategy
 hamaare export bataa rahe hai ki kis ranneeti ke saath aap pariksha main safal ho sakate hai
 Sudhir Jha, who has been giving guidance to competitive candidates for a long time, has said that lakhs of candidates have filled the form for this exam and in such a situation, there will be very less marks among the students and for this, students will have to catch all subjects
 chaatro ko ganit, general intelligence and rijning, general science or general awarenes se jude sawaalon par khaas dhyaan dene kii jarurat he
 Recruitment in Indian Railway, 10th pass can apply in this way
 They said that the students of maths number system, bodmas, decimal, fraction, LCM, HCF, percentage, time and work, time and distance, simple and mixed interest, benefits And read the loss, algebra, geometry and trigonometry topics well
 unhone kaha ki yah section sabase sabhi section kii apeksha adhik samay letaa he lekin abhyaas or shortkat tareeke se prashnon ko hal kar chaatr isamen samay bachaa sakate hai or iske liye formulon kaa yaad hona jaruri he
 For maths exam, remember at least 25 tables, square root of 50, cube up to 15, basic cube up to 15 and basic algebra formulas
 trikonmiti ke sabhi sutara or konon ke maan ko bhi nishchit rup se yaad kar len
 Also, you need to find the prime number between two numbers, check the divisibility, the fraction is quiet or the basics like turbulent, shortest, greatest
 kshetramiti ke sawaal sutara par aadhaarit hote he or thodi si saavdhaanee baratkar aap is prakaar ke prashnon ko aasaani se hal kar sakate hai
 How to do Reasoning: There is a need to focus on topics like analogy, coding and decoding, blood relation test reasoning, Venn diagram, data interpretation
 iske alaava, curent afares or 10veen tak ke saamaanya vigyaan ke vishyon kaa bhi revijan kar len
 How to study science, study NCERT books of class 9 and 10 for science section
 apane swayan ke nots banaaen or nots ko ek yaa do line praaroop main banane kaa prayaas karen
 He said that questions related to Indian Railways are often asked in various competitive examinations of Railways
 isliye chaatro ke rail bajet sahit bhartiya railway se jude anya tathy jarur yaad kar lene chahie
 This will be of great help in preparing for the first stage Computer Based Test (CBT)
 jha kaa kahana he ki pariksha kii taarikh najadik he or abhi revijan kaa sahi vakt he
 In such a situation, students should take maximum time to practice mock test paper and stay away from mobile and internet to avoid deviation
 unhone kaha ki railway pariksha ke pichley varshon ke paper hal karen
 This helps a lot in understanding the pattern of questions and solving them
 isse aap prayek vishay kii kathinaayee kaa str bhi jaan paaenge
 France's capital Paris is still moaning from the terror of ISIS and Baghdadi
 lekin paris ke dard se yah sawaal uthaa ki aies kaise puri duniya ke liye sirdard ban gaya
 And after that the biggest question raised by Russia's President Vladimir Putin is why 40 countries of the world are helping IS
 to koun hai wo 40 meharbaan jinhone bagdadi ko itnaa bada shaitan bana diya
 As the theme of the G20 conference changed, big leaders from all over the world arrived at the G20 conference in Antalya, Turkey, to gallop their countries on the development track
 lekin paris par aatanki hamale se bahes kii disha mud gai
 Now the question was how to save the world from the terrorist claws of IS
 lekin isse bhi bada sawaal uthaa ki aies or bagdadi kii madad koun kar rahaa he
 Putin made it clear that during the Isharasammelan, Russian President Vladimir Putin pointed out that there are 40 countries in the world that are helping Baghdadi
 aies ko paisa de rahe hai
 Putin has hinted, but now the question arises as to which countries are those which have become the masters of IS and Baghdadi
 kyon ve desh is aatanki sanghathan kii madad kar rahe hai
 Putin also pointed fingers at the G-20 countries, whose meetings created a furore over terror
 zarur padhentishish kii baukhalaahat kaa nateeja tha paris hamlaajee-20 main bhi aies ke madadgaarrus ke raashtrapati vladimir putin ke mutabik ISIS par unhone ji-20 deshon se apni kufia jaankariyaan saajha kii hai
 He gave an example of how money is reaching the IS from around 40 countries
 isamen ji-20 ke saathi desh bhi shaamil hai
 IS does illegal business of oil
 putin ise turant prabhaav se khatm karne kii zarurat par jor diya
 There are many countries Putin has exposed the hypocritical attitude of big and rich countries on the issue of Baghdadi fire
 lekin pehle yah jaananaa jaruri he ki wo koun se desh hai, jo aatank kaa ronaa bhi rote hai or aies kii bharpoor madad bhi karte hai
 The name of America is at the top of this list
 america ke alaava aies kaa taaja hamalaa jhelane vaala france, britain, australia, mexico, canada, isroyal, argentina, turki, saudi arab, katar, yuai, kuwait, bahrain, tunesia, libya jaise desh bhi rupee paise se bagdadi kii madad karte hai

 To which Russian President Putin has pointed fingers
 doharaa charitrasari hakeekat saamne aa jane ke baavjood america aies ko nestnabud karne kii hunkaar bhar rahaa he
 The twenty summit leaders of the G-20 countries, sitting in the Turkish capital, who declared war on IS, have two-thirds of the world's population and occupy 85 percent of the world's GDP
 vaise hi duniya kaa 75 fisadi kaarobaar yahi bees desh karte hai
 So, will those forty bosses of Baghdadi spread across the world learn from their mistakes and end the terror of Baghdadi
 yah apane aap main ek bada sawaal he

 dhoni kii naabad 45 ran kii pari kii madad se bharat kal vaaka main vishwacap ke pool match main westeindies ko chaar wicket se haraane main safal rahaa
 Speaking to the media, Dhoni said, "everyone feels that i don't feel pressured
" mujhe bhi kisi anya kii tarah dabaav mahasoos hota he
 The only thing is that i have faced this situation many times, so i know how to get out of this situation
 lekin aisa nahin hai ki main hameshaa safal rahun
 But it becomes easy when you know how to deal with it
 ’’ Starting as an aggressive batsman, Dhoni's game has improved a lot in the last decade and he is one of the best finishers in limited-overs cricket
 unhone kaha, ‘‘2006 ke pakistan daure ke baad meri ballebaaji main kaaphi sudhaar hua
 After that, i batted consistently in the lower order
 meraa sthaan 30 over ke baad he
 i have to play according to the demands of time
 kai baar aisa hota he ki ham pehle ballebaaji karte hai or mujhe bade shaat khilne padate hai
 While chasing the target, my role is to score fast or give stability to the innings
 ’’ After a long time Dhoni talked about his batting and also discussed the difficult situation that the team faced after the top order failed completely yesterday
 dhoni ne kaha, ‘‘yah hamaare liye acha he ki nichle madhya kram ko ballebaaji kaa mauka mila kyonki aap ran banaate rahanaa chaahate ho
 Whatever chance you get, you always think it would be better if a few more runs are scored
 yah acha mauka tha kyonki kuch dabaav tha
 '' bhartiya captain ne kaha, ‘‘main jis sthaan par ballebaaji karata hum aam taur par vahaan dabaav hota he
 Batting first either has the last five to seven overs left or is a West Indies match-like situation, the pressure of chasing the target
 yah vaastavik sthiti he, mujhe har haal main nichle kram ke saath saajhedaari kerani hoti he
 '' dhoni ne kaha, ‘‘maine (ravichandran) aswin ke saath saajhedaari kii
 The result was good
 acchhee cheez yah he ki chathe or saatven sthaan par aam taur par do vishesh bhoomikaayen hoti hai
 If the top order has given a good start, then get down on the field to get runs fast or handle the innings after the top order is out
 ’’ The feud between India's senior women cricketers Mithali Raj and Ramesh Powar will end without the administrators interfering as the coach's three-month term ends on Friday
 powar kaa kaarykaal puraa hone ke baad bisisiai is pad ke liye taaja aavedan mangavaayega
 It is likely that even after applying, Powar's name will no longer be considered
 bisisiai ke ek aalaa adhikari ne bataaya, ‘unka qaraar aaj khatm ho rahaa he or unki vaapasi kii sambhaavna bahut kam he
 The controversy arose due to the omission of Mithali in the semi-final against England during the ICC T20 World Cup in the West Indies
 bharat ko england ne us match main aath wicket se haraaya
 India will never win in Australia if they do not win this time: Dean Jonsmitali alleged that Powar wanted to ruin him while the coach questioned his attitude
 powar kii niyukti agast main hui thi jab tushaar arothe ne senior khilaadiyon ke saath matbhed ke kaaran pad chhod diya tha
 After Powar's departure, it remains to be seen how T20 captain Harmanpreet Kaur and ODI captain Mithali overcome their differences
 bharat ko ab janvari main newjiland kaa daura karnaa he or nae coach ke saath team vivaadon se dur rahane kii ummid karegi
 Another board official said, "it will be interesting to see how Harmanpreet and Mithali reconcile after what happened in the West Indies
" team kii bhalaai ke liye yah karnaa jaruri he varanaa dressing room main or masale honge
 Ponting's mind game about Kohli, told the kangaroo player, betterharmanpreet has not yet made any statement on the issue, but supported the decision to keep Mithali out in the semi-finals
 mitali pehle hi kah chuki he ki vah harmanpreet ke saath matbhed dur karnaa chaahati hai
 He said, 'we are both senior players and even if there are issues, we will sit together and resolve
 vah hamaari sarvshereshth khilaadiyon main se he or main hameshaa chaahuungi ki ham donon bharat ke liye sarvshereshth pradarshan kare

 haal hi main saal kii mostvated film padmavati se deepika padukon kaa maharani luk saamne aayaa he
 Since then, his royal look in the film corridors has remained the center of discussion
 phens ne bhi unhen rani padmavati ke luk ke liye saraahaa he
 But Anushka Sharma is unaware of this royal style of Deepika
 anoushka-viraat kohli kaa dikhaa tradishnal LOOK, PHOTOS viralwog vuman of da year awords main jab anoushka sedipikake luk ke bare main poocha gaya to unhone golmaal jawaab diya
 The actress said, do you know, from the place where i returned today after shooting, there was zero network
 vah ek aisi duniya thi jahaan naa network he, naa kisi ke massej yaa phone aate hai
 You do not know what is going on in the world
 main kuch samay se aisi hi jagah par thi
 It is near Mumbai
 main bahut khush thi
 i thought, this is also an experience of life
 jab deepika ke 'boyfriend' se milin anoushka sharma, aisa dikhaa andalnoushka ne aage kaha, isliye mujhe nahin pataa aaj kya relies hua he
 i have not seen anything
 agali baar jab main aap logon ke miloongi to zarur hi aapke is sawaal kaa jawaab duungi
 Well, Anushka then gave her answer
 lekin mjedaar baat yah he ki jis din yah bayaan diya gaya usee din unhone soshal media par ek tasviir post kii thi
 Therefore, it is beyond comprehension for Anushka to talk about zero network
 vaise deepika ko apni dost bataane vaali anoushka ne aisa jawaab kyon diya
 There is no conflict between the two
 kuch din pehlescgh awordsake dauraan anoushka or ranvir singh kii acchhee bond dekhi gai thi

 ye luk jitna aakshark he, deepika ko taiyaar hone main utana hi kam samay lagata tha
 Deepika Rani was ready for Padmini's role in just half an hour and at the same time she was given minimal makeup

 What is Rani Padmavati's story: The film's story is based on the life of Rani Padmavati
 ranvir singhlauddin khiljike role main hai
 This is the first time Ranveer will be seen in a negative role
 allaudin khilji or padmavati kaa prasang sufi kavi mallik mohammad jaaysi ne sher shah suri ke kaal main 1540 main likhaa tha
 According to the stories, Alauddin was enamored of Rani and attacked Chittorgarh to gain them

 ’unhone kaha, ‘kai log hai jo bharat kii taraf se khelnaa chaahate hai
 When you put yourself in that position, then you should also have the same hunger for runs and should not consider things as fixed

 Jaitley described Manmohan Singh as a man of grown-up and said that with scholarship he always had full information on the subjects he faced and spoke with full preparation
 manmohan singh rajyasabha main sadan ke netaa hai or jetali ucch sadan main vipaksh ke netaa hai
 Jaitley said that after providing leadership to the UPA government for ten years, when the curtain is going to fall, the Prime Minister is leaving with dignity and grace
 unhone apane blog par likhaa ki vah ek varisht rajaneta bane rahenge or ek vishwasaneey vyakti ke rup main raashtra kaa maargdarshan karte rahenge
 If he had stood up at the right time and expressed disagreements, he would have got even more respect
 unhone kaha ki singh kuch aisi vishesh paristhitiyon ke kaaran pradhanmantri bane the, jinamein congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ko is pad ke liye apana naam waapas lene liye majaboor kar diya tha
 He said that he was the Prime Minister announced by Soniaji literally
 unhen kuch simaaon ke bheetar hi kaam karnaa padaa
 Jaitley wrote that whenever he addressed the nation, he never appeared as a leader
 ek netaa ke rup main saamne nahin aane kaa kaaran saaf tha
 He never wanted a confrontation
 unhen pataa tha ki unhen simit shaktiyaan di gai hai or sabhi mahatvapurn faislon par unhen party tathaa uske pratham parivaar ko khush rakhana he
 Jaitley said that Singh has two important qualities
 pehla, jab bhi aap pradhanmantri se kisi gambhir vishay par charchaa karte hai, vah ek gyani vyakti ke rup main saamne aate hai
 He said that he appears as a scholar whom we call as a grown man
 jetali ne kaha ki singh ke shabd nape tule hote hai or vah koi tippanee karne se purv vichaar karte hai
 Second, his personal loyalty was beyond every doubt
 vidwata ke saath vah hameshaa kisi bhi vishay par puri tarah taiyaar rahete the
 The BJP leader said that in the last ten years he has got an opportunity to understand the Prime Minister very closely
 unhone kaha ki pichley paanch saalon main vipaksh ke netaa ke rup main unhone sansad main singh ke har vaakya ko suna or unke pradarshan kii samiksha kii
 The BJP leader wrote that there is no doubt that Manmohan Singh was a very good finance minister
 unhen varsh 1991 main aarthik sudhaaron kii pahal karne ke liye tatkaaleen pradhanmantri pi ve narsinha raav se bahut samarthan mila
 He said that Rao was never given the credit he really deserved

 In the case of the death of CBI Special Judge BH Loya, the Supreme Court dismissed the plea for an independent inquiry and said that there is no basis in the case, hence there would be no investigation in it
 court ne saaf kaha ki jaj loya kii maut par jajon dwaara die gaye bayaan par andeh kaa koi kaaran nahin he
 To doubt his statement would be like doubting the institution
 loya kii maut kii swatantra jaanch chaah rahe vakeelon ne apni maang ke samarthan main kai daleelein deen lekin supreme court ne unhen vajandaar nahin mana or sire se khaarij kar diya
 It is known that Judge Loya, who was hearing in the special CBI court of Kisohrabuddin Sheikh encountermalle, died in Nagpur on December 1, 2014, due to a heart attack
 ve nagpur apni sahyogi jaj swapna joshi kii beti kii shaadi main gaye hue the
 Suspecting his death, former chairman of Latur Bar Association, Uday Gavare, described Judge Loya's death as suspicious and said he was sure it was a premeditated murder
 unhone bataaya ki jis din loya kaa nidhan hua, usee din kai nyaayadhishon sahit kai logon ne unase kaha ki loya ko dhokhaa diya gaya he
 The case was so sensitive that no one dared to file a complaint
 vahiin, bombai hoicourt ke purv justise biji colse patil ne loya kii maut kii jaanch ko puure nyaaypalika kii pratishtha kii baat bataaya tha
 He said that the dignity of the judiciary is at stake, which everyone and the court have to save together
 colse patil ne kaha ki aaj bhi desh main dar kaa maahaul bana hua he
 This can open the case a lot
 supreme court main vakil indira jaisingh ne bhi jaj loya kii maut par andeh jataayaa tha
 He said that no one knows how the former Gujarat Home Minister Haren Pandaya died
 jo rajya apane grahamantri ko nahin bachaa saktaa, wo aam logon ko kaise bachaayegaa
 The case of Loya's death was therefore critical and sensitive
 jiske chalate maamle ko gujarat se baahar mumbai main chalaane ko kaha gaya tha
 He said, 'no one in Loya's family has any record of heart disease, his 80-year-old father or mother also does not have any disease like blood pressure or sugar, while Loya was 48 years old and he also has no heart disease
 There was no illness
 ' unki sehat ke bare main indira jaisingh ne bataaya ki wo do ghante rojaanaa vyaayaam karte the
 They also abstained from alcohol and smoking
 indira jaisingh ne bataaya ki ghatana ke din justise loya dard ke baavjood aspataal main khud seedhiyaan chadh kar upar gaye the
 It is also not clear whether he had an ECG or not, and if it happened, in which hospital and who did it
 unhone kaha, 'police ne bhi jaanch main kotahi barti
 Action was also not taken fully under CRPC 174
 saath hi exiaar bhi nahin darj kii gai
 The police should have prepared its case diary and sent it to the concerned magistrate, after which the magistrate would have directed to take further action
 'maharashtra ke patrkaar bies lonaki taraf se loya maamle main pesh hue senior vakil pallav sisodiya ne court se kaha tha is maamle kii swatantra jaanch ho
 Citing two conflicting reports, he said that due to this, 'the loyalty of our judicial system has come under attack
 ' unhone chaar nyaayadhishon kii press conference kaa zikr karte hue kaha ki isane bhi is adaalat ke kuch jajon dwaara maamle kii sunwaayee par akshep lagane kaa avasar pradaan kiya
 In such a situation independent investigation cannot be unilateral
 'vahiin, senior vakil prashanth bhushan ne jaj biech loya kii maut kii nyaayik jaanch yaa vishesh jaanch dal dwaara jaanch karaae jane kii maang kii thi
 He claimed that Loya did not die of a heart attack as claimed by government officials
 unhone maang kii ki isaki jaanch honi chahie
 He said that the CBI cannot investigate this because there is a lot of government pressure on him
 sarkaar chaahati he ki is maamle ko tatkaal kaarij kar diya jaae

 CP Thakur on Sunday said that he has requested Modi to contest the next Lok Sabha election from Nalanda parliamentary seat and due to popularity Modi will win from Nalanda parliamentary seat by a huge vote
 unhone kaha ki yah unki vyaktigat soch he
 However, Modi's contest from Nalanda parliamentary seat depends on Modi
 narendra modi ko pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar banaae jane kaa virodh karne vaale nitish kumaar kii party jediu ne bijepi dwaara modi ko chunaav abhiyaan samiti kaa pramukh banaae jane ke baad bijepi se naata tod liya tha
 On Thakur's offer to Modi to contest from Nalanda seat, JDU MP Shivanand Tiwari said that there is a discussion about Narendra Modi contesting from Varanasi, Lucknow and other places and this makes it seem that the most popular in Gujarat Modi's feet have been uprooted in his own state and he is not confident of his victory in Gujarat

 jdu's Harivansh Narayan Singh is the candidate from NDA for this post, while BK Hariprasad of Congress is in the fray from the opposition
 rajyasabha main sattadhari endie bahumat ke aankade se dur he jabaki vipaksh ke sabhi dalon ko milakar bahumat ke liye paryaapt siten ho rahi hai
 Despite this, if BK Hariprasad loses, the perceived opposition unity against Modi will be exposed
 bataa den ki haal hi main sevanivrutt hue upasabhapati pi je courian kaa kaarykaal pichley maheene yani july main samaapt ho gaya tha
 There are currently 244 members in the 245-member Rajya Sabha while 1 seat is vacant

 In this case, both the NDA and UPA are far from the majority figure
 sattadhari endie ke rajyasabha main 100 saansad hai
 These include 73 of the BJP, 3 of the Shiv Sena, 1 near the Bodo People's Front, 6 of the JDU, 1 of the RPI (A), 3 of the Shiromani Akali Dal, 1 of the Sikkim Democratic Front, 4 of the nominees, 3 others and 6 of the Independents

 After this election, the opposition's picture will be clear as to which parties stand with the Congress against PM Modi and which are not

 The NDA is engaged in mobilizing support from opposition parties along with its own community
 abhi tak endie se jude sabhi sahyogi dal harivansh singh ke samarthan main puri mustaidi se khadey hai
 Apart from this, the NDA also seems to be able to break into the unity of the opposition
 sattapaksh kii tulana main vipaksh takatkar he, lekin sabhi dal congress ummidavaar ke paksh main khadey hote nahin dikh rahe
 The TDP has announced support for the Congress
 lekin kesiar kii party tiares or naveen patnayak kii party bijedy ke liye congress ummidavaar kaa samarthan karnaa mushkil najar aa rahaa he
 Similarly, AIADMK is also difficult to come up with Congress
 aam aadmi party ke teen rajyasabha sadsy hai
 Party leader and Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Singh said that Congress President Rahul Gandhi should talk to our party's National Convenor Arvind Kejriwal for support in the Deputy Speaker election, because he is the one to decide on it
 haalanki congress ne bhi vipaksh dalon se samarthan ke liye baatcheet shuru kar di he
 BK Hariprasad himself and Congress Ghulam Nabi Azad to Ashok Gehlot are engaged in gathering support from opposition parties
 baavjood iske bijedy, tiares jaise dal endie ummidavaar ke paksh main khadey najar aa rahe hai
 If the opposition parties see a dent in this way, then it will be very difficult for the Congress's BK Hariprasad to win

 India Today has documents that indicate possible misconduct in Delhi's Aam Aadmi Party government
 usee sarkaar ke jisaki kaman aise shaks ke haath main he jise kabhi bhrashtachar virdohi andolan kaa cheharaa mana jaataa tha
 There is irrefutable evidence under investigation that indicates how close relatives of the Chief Minister submitted fake bills for a civic project commissioned by the PWD department
 peedbludi department ab dilli sarkaar ke mantri satyendra jain ke tahat aata he
 Kejriwal's late sister-in-law Surendra Kumar Bansal owned the Pasrenu Construction Company
 dastavej se pataa chalata he ki renu construction company ko 2015 main uttar pashchim dilli main rashtriya rajmarg 44 ke paas bakali gaanv main ek drenez project kaa jimmaa mila tha
 According to government records, the contract was awarded because of the lowest bid to Renu Construction

 Manoj Tiwari said that now it is understandable why Satyendar Jain was giving 2 crore to Arvind Kejriwal
 is mudde kii jaanch hone chahie, kyonki isamen sidhe taur par kejariwal kii jimmedaari he
 Manoj Tiwari alleged that the money of tax paying people in Delhi is being looted
 lekin ab aise sanket mil rahe hai ki sattaruqam aadmi party ateet aisa kuch kiya jise wo saarvajanik taur par saamne nahin aane dena chaahati thi
 The document indicates fraudulent methods which may have been adopted by the relative of the chief minister to defraud the government treasury
 bansal, jo ab is duniya main nahin, dastavej ke mutabik mahadev impex se drenez system ke liye nirmaan saamagree jutate dikhe
 But when the India Today team reached the given address of this company - B-22 Industrial Area in Sonepat, the name of the company of this name did not show up

 This scandal, pointing to an important member of Kejriwal's extended family, has come at a time when the Aam Aadmi Party itself is facing a bombardment of allegations from dismissed minister Kapil Mishra
 kapil mishra ne kejariwal, unki sarkaar ke mantri satyendra jain or yahaan tak ki bansal ko bhi aaropon kaa nishaanaa banaaya he
 However, the Chief Minister's family has denied all allegations of Mishra adopting a rebel attitude
 saath hi kaha he ki isaki patakatha raajnneetik virodhiyon kii or se likhi gai he
 Kejriwal's wife Sunita Kejriwal tweeted a tweet in response to Mishra's allegations
 sunita kejariwal ne twit main likhaa- ‘mere jija is duniya main nahin hai or ye murkh vyakti apane dimag kaa istemaal kiye bina likhi hui script ko pard rahaa he
 Meanwhile, the Delhi government has denied any involvement in the PWD drain scam
 saarvajanik kaary mantri satyendra jain ne kaha, ‘ye contract (bansal ko) aam aadmi party kii sarkaar aane se pehle pratispardhaatmak boli ke baad janvari 2015 main diya gaya tha
 We came to power in February 2015
 ’jain ne kaha ki mantri har company ke bhugtan main shaamil nahin he
 There are thousands of such companies operating in Delhi

 desh main adaalaton main lambit mukademe aarthik vikaas par gahari chot kar rahe hai
 In the Economic Survey 2017-18, it was said that the cost of railway, road, power project increased by more than 60% due to cases stuck in the court
 vibhinn adhyayan bataate hai ki desh main karon se jude kai lakh karod ke mukademe adaalaton main fanse hue hai or zyaadaatar main sarkaar main apil kii gai he
 But the problem of pending lawsuits begins at the bottom
 2018-19 ke aarthik survey ke anusaar, desh main kul lambit maamalon ke 87
 54% of the cases are pending in the lower courts
 odisha, bihar, pashchim bengal, uttar pradesh or gujarat main nichali adaalaton main chaar saal se bhi zyada vakt se lambit pade mukademon kii sankhya sabase zyada he
 The time taken to handle both civil and criminal cases in Odisha, Bihar and West Bengal is much higher than the national average
 sarkaar kahati he ki 2018 main jila or adhinsth nyaayalayon main 74
 7 percent civil and 86
 5 fisadi aapraadhik maamalon kaa nibatara teen saal ke bheetar hua

 33 maamle nipataae gaye lekin lambit mukademon kii sankhya 3
 04 crores
 aktubar 2018 tak supreme court main 56 hajaar se zyada maamle lambit the jabaki vibhinn ucch nyaayalayon main lambit mukademon kii sankhya june 2018 tak 44 lakh se zyada thi
 Criminal cases are two and a half times higher than those pending in lower courts
 mukademe nipataane main amerka or europe kaa record bharat se kaaphi acha he
 Compared to the member countries of the Council of Europe, it takes four to six times longer to settle a case in India
 mukademon ke lambit hone kii vajah buniyadi dhaanche main chhipi he
 The number of judges in the country is less than the requirement
 disambar 2018 tak nichali adaalaton main jajon kii sweekrut sankhya 22750 ke mukaable kul karyrat jaj 17891 (79 fisadi) hi the
 2279 additional judges were needed to settle all 2018 cases
 agle paanch saalon main sabhi mukademon ke niptaan ke liye 8 hajaar se zyada nyaayadhishon kii jarurat hogi
 a High Court Judge handles 2348 litigations a year
 ucch nyaayalayon main jajon kii sweekrut sankhya 1079 ke mukaable 2018 ke ant tak 671 (62 fisadi) jaj hi kaam kar rahe the
 Even if the new judges are admitted, the government will have to spend a lot of money to build rooms for their court
 mukademe lambit hone kii sabase badi vajah mahangaa nyaay he
 People remain in jails because they do not have the money to hire a lawyer
 jelon main 67 fisadi se zyada vichaaradhin kaidi hai
 The government also has to bear their expenses
 sarkaar ne lambit mukademon par aarthik survey main chintaa to bahut jataai he lekin inako nipataane ke liye dhan kii vyavastha karne main niraashajanak ravaiya apanaaya he
 The budget allocated for the Department of Law and Justice has been drastically reduced in the 2019-20 budget
 2018-19 ke bajet main vidhi or nyaay vibhaag ke liye 4386 karod kaa aavanton kiya gaya tha jabaki 2019-20 ke bajet main isamen jabardast katautee kar 3055 karod rupye kar diya gaya he
 The Election Commission also comes under the Department of Law and Justice and its expenditure is also linked in this

 UPPCL starts to collect outstanding bills due to non-payment of electricity bills in many villages in Kanpur
 UP Power Corporation Limited (UPPCL) is upset due to non-payment of electricity bills in several villages of UP
 upipisiel ne ab bakaayaa bill vasuulne kaa ek anokhaa tarika shuru kiya he
 The power department walks around the village every day carrying a promotional vehicle and appeals to the people to pay the outstanding bills
 nabbe ke dashak main chote jilon main jin logon kaa janm hua he unhen yaad hoga, jab unke muhalle main rickshaw par baithkar ek anounsar filmon kaa prachaar karata tha
 The style used to call people to the image hall i
e
 the cinema hall used to attract people immensely
 kai chote bachche, rickshaw ke peeche kaaphi dur tak bhaagate rahete the or anounsar film, usamen kaam karne vaale kalakaar, sho time aadi kii jaankaree detaa rahata tha
 The song of the film ran in between dialogues
 bachche gane ke saath jhuumate gaate peeche-peeche daudte rahete the
 The view of Khakherru village in UP also reminds me of those days
 khaskar anounsar ke bolne kaa andaaj or shaayari puraane dinon main khinch le jaati he
 The Announcer first speaks to UPPCL and appeals to the people to submit the bill
 wo kahata he ki agar kisi ne bill jamaa nahin karaayaa to uskaa conection cat saktaa he, uske khilaaf kanoonee karrwai ho sakati he
 Then the old song starts playing and then the poetry
 
 In the style of the old days
 
 Without the consent of the above, a leaf cannot be moved, there cannot be a better opportunity to deposit the outstanding electricity bill
 
 
 bich main gane kii dhun chalati he
 Then the artist says - a person cannot sleep before falling asleep, whose house is deposited there cannot be darkness in his house
 
 
 insaan is duniya main akelaa aayaa he akelaa jayega, jo bijli kaa bill jamaa nahin karegaa uske ghar main andhera ho jayega
 
 
 
 phir film 'pyaar kii jeet' kaa ek gaanaa chalane lagata he- aaj mere pyaar kii jeet ho jane do
 
 
 
 
 In the voice of Asha Bhosle
 phir kalakaar duusari shaayari bolta he- paisa fark daal detaa he har rishton main, ab gharelu bill jamaa kiijie kishton main
 
 
 The music starts playing
 
 Then the Announcer speaks - this is a good and golden opportunity for all of you
 
 
 phir laudspikar par gaanaa chalane lagata he
 
 vafaa ke naam ko aam kar jaaun main
 
 
 
 
 Then live or die after that
 
 
 anounsar phir agali shaayari bolta he- ek taraf siri he duusari taraf paan he, ye power house khakhareru kii jaan he
 
 
 a little music plays
 phir kalakaar agali shaayari bolta he- vakt se pehle maut aa nahin sakati, is power house kii lite kabhi ja nahin sakati
 
 
 The song goes - Let the body be auctioned today
 
 
 anounsar kahata he- aap sabhi logon ko suchit kiya jaataa he ki apana-apana bill turant jamaa kara den kishton main
 
 
 He goes on to say - One thing is very clear, the interest is pardoned by the government
 byaaz kaa paisa nahin lagegaa
 Why won't you say? So brother will not look honestly
 har insaan ke paas koi na koi majaburi he lekin batti jalaayee he to phir bill dena bhi zaruri he
 
 
 Then the song goes, let love be conquered
 
 
 
 And they start carrying the jeep back
 
 
 
 If you did not enjoy reading then below is the video
 
 Look and get lost in nostalgia
 
 
 
 So pesh-e-khidmat is xxrep 4 - bandook chalaani nahin aati
 Do not know how to load pistol
 hathiyaaron ke naam to khayr koun yaad rakhe
 i do not remember when the expiry date of bullet and tear gas shells came out
 ab aise main aap upi police se kya ummid karegein? bas itnaa hi kah sakate hai ki sachmuch kamaal he yogi ji kii police
 Now, if someone does not mind, then let me also tell you that the UP Police is opening up the pole-band of so many of the police personnel
 darasal, upi police ke ek sahab ko laga ki chalo zaraa apni team kaa test le len
 Now what happens in that test is worth seeing
 yogi ji to kah rahe the ki uttar pradesh kii police ko aisa bana denge ki khud neuyork kaa police department aakar poochhega ki bhai karte kaise ho
 So now the curtain is going to be removed from this secret formula of UP Police
 kyonki ham ab aapako dikhaane ja rahe hai ki aakhir upi police karti kaise he
 First of all, have a glimpse of the training of Najibabad police station of Bijnor district of Western UP
 jahaan bijanour ke sio arun kumaar ne aane se kaaphi pehle ye kah diya tha ki wo nirikshan karne aa rahe hai
 The inspection started with these inspector of UP
 daroga ji ko pallate gan diya gaya or kaha chalie
 Hey, is this what you missed? sio saabah chilla uthe
 For a long time, the government has given this pellet to the gun station
 thane ke divaan sahab ne sambhaal kar bhi rakhi
 But na diwan means to sir
 naa inspector sahab se matlab
 Job is going on chalane dijie
 Thanedar drove, but what is that sir again saying Oh my God
 
 Then she missed
 magar ab aglaa fire kaise karen
 Where will the bullet take place
 koi to bataa do
 Sahab said to the Thanedar, now put the gun down
 goli change karo
 Standing there watching all this, Diwan Saheb was like a respect
 unhone thanedaar se bandook chhini or khud nishaanaa lagane lage
 But what did the divan shoot, but he got angry
 ab to nirikshan adhikari ne aakhirkaar kah hi diya, rahane do tumse naa ho paaegaa
 Now let's try another gun
 koi bolege nahin
 One sir is standing on his head
 upar se duusare saathiyon ke saamne beijjati bhi ho rahi he
 Come on, at least the Inspector will know how this gun works
 sahab ne poocha- bataaiye ise chalaate kaise hai
 And what is this gun called
 aaj to sardaar ji mushkil main funs gaye hai
 Because the Inspector has no answer to any question of the CO
 sahab ne jhallaakar poocha, pehla kaam kya karte hai
 Diwan Sahab is repeatedly trying to help Inspector Sahab
 magar sio sahab ne unhen chup kara diya
 After about 15 to 20 minutes of testing, it was decided that the inspector did not know how to fire a gun, nor did he know anything about it
 sahab ne apane staff se kaha "likhon in sabake bare main
 
 
 There is zero information
 " khayr ab inspector sahab kii jaankaree zero he
 So instead of inspecting the SO sir started giving information about weapons
 magar ye kya esao sahab ke samajhane or bataane ke baad bhi inspector sahab gan nahin chalaa paae
 In total, ashali and gunpowder, lying on a blanket, destroyed the conscience of these UP Police personnel
 sio sahab ko majaburi main kahana padaa- agar aap practice nahin karenge to barkhaast ho jaaenge
 It is not that the CO has come to inspect any special inspector at the police station
 balki unka ye ouchik nirikshan to police thane or pulisavaalon kii taiyaari ke liye tha
 So now it was the turn of general and practical knowledge of other policemen of the police station
 unhone thane ke usee inspector se poocha is asalhe kaa naam kya he
 Sir sir, Inspector sir does not even know the name of the gun
 to ye use chalaayenge kaise
 Even the Inspector, with a gun carrying a Tier Gas in his hands, could not tell what he was called
 sio sahab phir jhalla gaye or bole- chhod do nahin ho paaegaa tumse
 Now it was the turn of the second inspector of the police station
 jinke haath main aansu gas ke gole die gaye
 i was asked how the officer runs it
 to dekhie inspector sahab ne kya bataaya
 They said that they would run tear gas and sahib would lie down
 sio sahab ne sawaal daaga- aansu gas kaa gola chalaane ke baad aap let jaaenge? phir sio sahab ne sabaki class lagaai
 What is the level of UP Police personnel in general knowledge of weapons
 thane ke do darogaaon ko chhodkar duusare daroga to pistal or duusari riflon ko khol kar dobaaraa band bhi nahi kar paae
 Neither did he know the names of the weapons
 javaanon ke nirikshan ke baad sahab aage bade
 What was revealed when weapons were inspected
 pataa chalaa ki kai bandook or hathgole to chaar-chaar saal puraane hai
 The cartridges are damaged
 aansu gas ke gole bhi dhokhaa de gaye
 Now CO Arun Kumar was badly fussed and said - all these have expired
 darasal, ye daura tha bijanour ke ek sio arun kumaar kaa jo nazibabad thane pahunche the nirikshan karne
 Now think that if the soldiers are not ready to deal with an emergency in the police station and their weapons are of expiry date, then how events like Bulandshahar and Ghazipur happened then
 shaayad isi aadhi adhuri taiyaari kaa hi nateeja tha bulandshahr main inspector subodh kumaar kii maut
 And soldier Suresh Vats died in Ghazipur
 kul mila kar upi police ke thanon or javaanon main bas itani si dikkat he
 Everything else is fine

 Prime Minister Ujjwala Yojana was very important in the achievements of the last three years of the Narendra Modi government
 centre main bijepi kii sarkaar banane ke baad sabsidi ko sidhe khate main hastantarit karne kii pahal shuru hui, jiske jariye farji conekshnon ko rokane kaa abhiyaan chalaa or sarkaar ne 21,000 karod rupye bachaae
 Gradually the scheme started on the initiative of Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan became the flagship scheme of the Central Government
 march, 2015 main petroleum mantralay ke urja sangam kaarykram main pradhanmantri narendra modi ne 'give it ap' kii apil kii
 He appealed to the affluent to give up LPG subsidy, but according to Pradhan, what the Prime Minister said in the program that "the money left from the give it up will not be in the coffers of the government but the poor"
 The framework of the Ujjwala scheme was prepared
 antarrashtriya bazaar main petrol or gas kii girti keemat modi sarkaar ke liye badi saugat banakar ai
 The Modi government used this savings in the fuel bill to give LPG connections to the poor
 isamen tel companiyon ke siesaar fund se 1,000 karod ru
 Pooled and about 65 lakh new connections were distributed
 bipiel pariwaron main utsaah dekhne ke baad sarkaar ne ise ek thos yojana ke taur par aage badhaane kii ranneeti banaai gai
 Also read: Do not be outdone like George Bush on the front of the economy Narendra Modi Petroleum Minister denies any political benefit from the Ujjwala scheme
 unka maananaa he ki yah yojana saamaajik-rajnatik badlaav kii nazeer banegi
 This will reduce health expenditure besides empowering women and protecting the environment
 khaanaa banane main lagane vaala samay bachane se use duusare utpaadak kaamon main lagaaya ja sakegaa
 This is the first such scheme of the Modi government which is directly reaching home like the UPA government's MGNREGA
 isliye sarkaar ne ise 2019 ke aam chunaav se pehle tak 5 karod bipiel pariwaron tak pahunchane kaa lakshya rakhaa he
 At the same time, the biggest benefit to the Modi government from this scheme has been in cutting kerosene subsidy
 gauratlab he ki petroleum mantri dharmendra pradhan ke mutabik desh main kisi ko bhi do sabsidi ek saath nahin di ja sakati he
 Hence, as LPG cylinders will be expanded in the country under Ujjwala, the central government will get rid of the huge subsidy on kerosene
 haalanki modi sarkaar kaa daawa he ki is yojana kaa raajnneetik paksh nahin he
 But it is also a reality that due to the success of the Ujjwala scheme, the Modi government will not miss it by luring poor voters in the 2019 general elections
 lihaaja, is dharmendra pradhan kii is safalataa ke chalate jahaan modi cabinet main unhen ek safal mantri kaa darja mila vahiin isse unka pramotion bhi tay ho gaya

 There is a relationship with Li, which has been said in the media section to have shown interest in the manufacture of battery-powered rickshaws

 More than two lakh e-rickshaws are operating in Delhi National Capital Region and various parts of the country
 bayaan ke anusaar i-rickshaw ke nirmaan kaa jimmaa keval unheen nirmaataaon ko diya gaya he, jinhen vaigyanik evam audyogic anusandhan parishad (siesaiaar) se iske liye license mila he
 It said that the license to manufacture e-rickshaws is the work of CSIR and if a firm wants to produce it, it can apply for the license from CSIR
 bayaan ke anusaar, na to gadakari or na hi unke parivaar kaa koi sadsy kisi i-rickshaw nirmaan form se judaa he

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has little scope to fulfill his election promise
 isaki vajah yah he kimodi sarkaarko rajasav main kami kii samasya se jujhna pad rahaa he
 In such a situation, there is no scope to reduce the corporate tax from 30% to 25%
 2019 caloksabhaa chunaavse pehle sarkaar kaa yah aakhri purna bajet he
 After the budget, it is expected that after seeing the elections in many states and the Lok Sabha elections next year, this budget will be populist
 haalanki iconomi kii sust haalat or sarkaar ke rajasav main kami ko dekhte hue aisa karnaa sarkaar ke liye aasaan nahin hoga
 Bloomberg said in a report that industries may have to wait longer to cut corporate tax
 piem modi ne 4 saal pehle 2015 main corporate tex main katautee kaa vaada kiya tha
 However, during the last 4 years, he has not been able to prepare any roadmap on this front
 sarkaar kii taraf se desh main kaarobaar karne ke liye lagaataar naye-naye sudhaar kiye ja rahe hai
 Along with reducing the red tape, the speed of bad loan recovery has also increased
 isse bharat ko antarrashtriya sansthaaon kii taraf se reating ke morche par kaaphi acchhee khabaren mil rahi hai
 But many challenges to the economy in the house are facing the Modi government
 nivesh ko badhaane kii jaruratmodi sarkardesh main videshi nivesh ko badhaane kii jugat main juty hui he
 PM Narendra Modi has also invited foreign companies to invest in India in Davos
 nivesh badhaane ke liye corporate tex samet kaarobaar kii anya baadhaon ko dur karne par uskaa jor he, lekin rajasav kii kami ne is kaam ko kaaphi mushkil kar diya he
 Looking at the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, it is believed that the government's focus in this budget will be on agriculture
 iconomic survey main bhi krishi kii haalat sudhaarney par jor diya gaya he
 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has also indicated this

 Other countries are also emerging as a challenge before India
 duusare desh lagaatarkorporate taxctaakar kaarobaar ke liye maahaul sudhaarney main jute hue hai
 If India wants to call the world's biggest companies in its country
 nivesh badhanaa chahta he, to use bhi corporate tex main chhot jaise kadam uthaane honge
 However, this does not seem to happen at the moment

 The Congress guarantees that it will give 72000 rupees every year to each of the 20% poorest families in the country
 yah paisa unke bank khate main sidhaa daal diya jayega
 "rahul Gandhi said," If Modi ji can give money to the richest people, then Congress will also give money to the poorest people
 ' ise duniya kii sabase badi nunatam aay yojana qaraar dete hue unhone kaha ki yah garibi par aakhri hamalaa he
 This scheme will be run in a phased manner
 ‘‘yah bahut hi prabhaavshaalee or sochi samajhi yojana he
 We have discussed the plan with several economists
 ' gandhi ne kaha ki puraa akalan kar liya gaya
 Everything has been decided
 unhone kaha ki isse paanch karod parivaar yani 25 karod logon ko phayda hoga
 Rahul said that if there is less income than minimum income in India, then it will be an attempt to increase income
 jisase garibi se nikaala ja saktaa he
 It will lift 25 crore people out of poverty in the second phase
 is yojana ko ham aage laakar dikhaaenge

 Is it appropriate to express such feelings about religious festivals? '

 Samajwadi Party (SP) and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) coalition in Uttar Pradesh for the upcoming Lok Sabha elections, and the SP denied reports that the alliance has not been finalized
 darasal espi or bispi ke bich gathbandhan tay hone or siton ke bantwaare ke aankade ke li hone ke baad, gathbandhan ko lekar achaanak siyaasi ubaal aa gaya
 Samajwadi Party has tried to put a stop to the matter at present, party spokesperson Sunil Sajan in Lucknow said that the Congress will be part of the alliance or not, nothing has been decided yet and Akhilesh Yadav will take its final decision
 udhar dilli main bhi samaajawaadee party ke bade netaa ramgopal yadav ne bhi gathbandhan se congress ko baahar rakhane kii khabaron kaa khandan kiya or kaha ki abhi kuch bhi tay nahin hua he
 Explain that both SP and BSP in Uttar Pradesh want to see Congress fighting separately, so that BJP votes can be divided
 gathbandhan ke baad congress ke alag ladane kaa phayda bhi gorakhpur or phulpur main in donon dalon ko mil chukaa he
 In such a situation, party sources suggest that both the parties want to leave Amethi and Rae Bareli seats for the Congress, while the SP, BSP and RLD will maintain a coalition on the remaining seats
 bispi supremeo mayawati ne jab madhya pradesh or chhattisgarh main congress se apana gathbandhan nahin karne kaa faisla kiya, to akhilesh yadav ne bhi madhya pradesh main congress se gathbandhan nahin karne kaa faisla kiya tha
 However, after the victory, both parties gave their support to the Congress without asking
 akhilesh yadav or mayawaticongress ke teenon mukhyamantriyon ke shapath grahan main na to khud pahunche na hi kisi bade netaa ko bheja
 In such a situation, a big question arose on the alliance
 upi congress ke netaa or pravaktaa akhilesh pratap singh kehete hai ki gathbandhan se congress ko alag rakhane kii khabar ek sajeesh he jabaki sachai yah he ki abhi teenon dalon main gathbandhan ko lekar koi aakhri baatcheet nahin hui he
 According to Akhilesh Pratap Singh, a big coalition is needed against BJP and a big coalition will also be formed in Uttar Pradesh

 It is alleged that Bhim Army convened a Mahapanchayat of Dalits on May 9 at Ravidas Hostel in Saharanpur to protest against the arson of Dalits' house in Shabbirpur
 is mahapanchayat ko prashasan kii anumati nahin thi, jiske chalate chatravaas main pahunch rahe bhim army ke kaaryakartaaon or unke dalit samarthakon ko police ne khaded diya
 After being driven away by the police, Bhim Army activists and many Dalit supporters went to Gandhi Maidan in Saharanpur
 gandhi maidan par police or bhim army ke bich hui kahasuni, lathicharge or patharav tak pahunch gai
 According to an FIR lodged by the Saharanpur police, activists of the Bhim Army, Bidke, and their Dalit supporters set fire to several motorcycles in the area and blocked several paths by dropping brick stones
 is ghatana ke baad saharanpur police ne FIR darj kar liya, jiske baad bhim army ke sansthaapak chandrashekhar or uske kai netaa or kaaryakarta faraar hai, jinaki talash police ko abhi bhi he
 Till date, before this, you have told about the Bhim Army, which calls itself the guardian of Dalits

 The founder of Bhima Army, Chandrasekhar is absconding, but some of its leaders and activists are still present in Saharanpur city
 ajtak samvaadadaata ne jab 9 may kii ghatana par sawaal puche to vinay ratna ne hinsa ke peeche bhim army kaa haath hone se saaf inkaar kar diya
 Not only this, the Bhima Army alleges that the police want to kill its founder Chandrashekhar in an encounter

 unhone kaha ki chaatro ke bich bheed main aae bahari logon ne patharav kiya or bhim army ko badnaam karne kaa kaam kiya
 Vinay claims that the Bhima Army was seeking compensation for the Dalits whose houses were burnt in Shabbirpur village

 While the students of Delhi are happy with this initiative, students from other states of the country are disappointed
 khaskar noida, ghaziabad or gudgaanv jaise dilli ke aasapaas ke ilaake ke chaatr behad naaraaz he or aisa hone par apane bhavishya ko lekar sawaal khadey kar rahe hai
 The Delhi Chief Minister says that the students of Kirajdhani have been continuously expressing grief to them that despite good marks, they are not able to get admission in their own city colleges due to high cutoff
 isaki vajah yah he ki unke saath-saath desh ke anya rajyon ke chaatr bhi daakhile kii daud main hissaa banate he, jisase unki siten chhin jaati he or majabuuran unako chote collejon main pravesh lenaa padataa he
 This initiative will provide admission to the students of Delhi
 par vahiin rajdhani ke collejon par samaan adhikaar kaa hawala dete hue duusare shaharon ke chaatr is pahal ko galat tehra rahe hai
 Ghaziabad's student Desperate Kejriwal's decision is extremely disheartening in Ghaziabad, adjoining Delhi
 yahaan kii rahane vaali dipti ne isi saal commers stream se 12veen kii pariksha 95% anko se paas kii he or uskaa sapanadilli uniwarsitike kisi college main daakhila lene kaa tha, kyonki ghaziabad main achche college nahin hai
 He says that if this happens, his dream will be broken
 mere paas yahaan koi doosraa vikalp bhi nahin he or dilli uniwarsity se padhakar unako behatar bhavishya kii ummid thi, jo aisa hone par puri nahin hogi
 Noida students are also concerned
 Noida is very close to Delhi
 yahaan bade privet college to he, par unki mahangi fees se zyaadaatar chaatr daakhila nahin le pate hai
 Delhi can be reached easily via metro from Noida and the fees of colleges of Delhi University are less than elsewhere, due to which thousands of students reach Delhi with the dream of better future
 noida kii sakshi kaa kahana he, 'dilli sarkaar is tarah kaa faisla nahin le sakati
 Delhi is the capital of the country and is owned by all
 mere bhi 98% ank he
 Where will i go now baahar padhaane ke liye mere mata-pita ke paas paise nahin he
 Where will we go now? gudgaanv ke chaatr naarazdilli ke mukhyamantri ke faisle se gudgaanv ke chaatr behad naaraaz hai
 12th pass students as well as students studying in 12th are also questioning this initiative
 agle saal dilli uniwarsity main daakhile ke liye abhi se taiyaari kar rahi neha behad gusse main hai
 He says how can he do this with them? We work hard day and night for good marks and admission in the capital's college is based on merit
 dilli ke chaatr bhi mehnat kare or admician le len
 If there is reservation in colleges of all states, then no student of the country will be able to enroll elsewhere

 Many questions are being raised about the circumstances under which Maoist attack on CRPF jawans in Sukma
 sabase bada sawaal ye he ki akhir maovadiyon ko gaanvvaalon kaa aisa samarthan kaise mil gaya ki wo itani badi taadaad main chup kar ikattha ho sake
 The answer to this question is with a senior officer of NITI Aayog
 "sukama jaise naksal-prabhavit ilaakon main sthaneey tribals ko krishi or jangal kii zamin se bade str par bedakhal kiya gaya he, jisaki vajah se naksaliyon ko vahaan panaah mil rahi he
 "T Haq, chairman of the Special Cell on Land Policy of NITI Aayog, said this in a conversation with NDTV
 sukama kii samasya kaaphi had tak ilaake ke kisaanon kii bedakhli se judi he
 t Haq believes that this is the reason the Maoists managed to hold their own here
 haq enditivi se kehete hai, "naksali logon ko bahakaate hai ki sarkaar ne unki zamin chin lee he
 Naxalites get the sympathy of the local people
 jab tak sthaneey logon kaa link naksaliyon se khatm nahin hoga, ilaake main vikaas sambhav nahin hoga

 bijepi ne sankalp patr taiyaar karne ke liye aaj dilli ke alpsankhyakon kii raay lee
 Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi and Thawarchand Gehlot, who were present on the occasion, also had to deal with some sharp questions from the minorities
 sawaal uthaa ki aisa lagata he ki bijepi ko musalamaanon ko vot kii jarurat nahin he
 Why does BJP consider us untouchables? Such tough questions from Sajid Rashidi, two BJP ministers, Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi and Thawarchand Gehlot, who came to take suggestions for the resolution, had to be two to four
 haalanki guuruuvaar ko alpsankhyak samaaj ke buddhijivi, kala cinema or patrakaron ko suzav dene ke liye bulaayaa tha lekin aatankwaad se lekar musalamaanon par shaq karne kaa mudda jorshor se uthaa
 On this, the Minister had to give cleanliness
 dilli imam association ke adhyaksh sajid rashid ne kaha ki aatankwaad ke naam par nirdosh bacchon ko uthaaya jaataa he
 Then after years of case, they prove innocent, but their life gets spoiled
 unke punarvaas ke liye bhi sochna chahie
 Union Minister for Minority Affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said that this is absolutely a matter of concern for the government
 ham aapaki baat ko jarur pahunchaayenge
 Retired Justice ZU Khan of Delhi High Court said that if we wear the turban of Sardar then we do not doubt but as soon as we wear hats and pajamas people start doubting us, why is it so? In view of this, the BJP is taking opinions from different communities and professionals across the country so that their suggestion can be included in the resolution letter
 alpsankhyakon kii raay jaanane ke liye dilli ke kareeb teen sau logon ko bulaayaa gaya tha jisamen jane maane nirmaataa nirdeshak mujffar ali se lekar chrishchiyan or parsi samudaay se bhi tamaam log pahunche
 But everyone's complaint was that their participation in the BJP government was very low

 The committee on literature should include people from all communities

 bjp's effort for the resolution letter is to involve the problem of every community by taking feedback from about two crore people across the country, but to gain the trust of the minorities, the BJP will have to make more efforts
 loksabhaa chunaav sir par he, lihaaja bijepi ko alpsmakhyakon kii bhi yaad ai he
 But how will the trust of the minorities be built on the government when many BJP leaders have given several controversial statements about the minorities from the public platform and the BJP has kept silence on them

 Party's Punjab in-charge Sanjay Singh said on Sunday that one lakh people will take to the road against the Rs 12,000 crore grain scam

 a Sri Lankan citizen has been arrested in Kerala
 uske paas vaid yatra dastavej nahin hone ke kaaran hiraasat main liya gaya
 There are reports that after the serial blasts on Easter in Sri Lanka some accused have fled to other countries
 ise dekhte hue kerala main hui is giraftaar ko ahm mana ja rahaa he
 Police said the man, who described himself as Malughe Juth Selfon Dyer, was caught at Thampanoor bus terminal in Thiruvananthapuram on Saturday night

 Now, Intelligence Bureau (IB) officials are questioning him
 ibi report ke aadhaar par ham aage kii karrwai karenge
 No case has been registered so far
 ’adhikari ne bataaya ki vyakti ne daawa kiya ki vah 20 farvari ko kerala pahunchaa tha
 The detention of a Sri Lankan person is believed to be important in this context as there were reports that the accused who carried out the blasts on the occasion of Easter in Sri Lanka have traveled
 isse pehle 1 may ko tamilnadu police ne daawa kiya ki chennai ke bahari ilaakon main vaid kagajaat ke bina rah rahe ek srilankai naagarik ko giraftaar kiya gaya he
 Acting on a tip-off, the police searched an apartment and arrested a Sri Lankan citizen named Roshan
 roshan ke paas passport or vija jaise jaruri yatra dastavej nahin the, or wo kai maheenon pehle bharat main pravesh kiya tha
 He was staying with some other Sri Lankan citizens who had valid papers
 police jaanch kar rahi he ki kya roshan kisi bhi tarah se colombo main easter ke din ravivaar ko hue visphoton se judaa to nahin he
 Significantly, on February 21 in Sri Lanka, nine suicide bombers, including a woman, had exploded in three churches and three luxury hotels, killing 253 people and injuring more than 500
 big bos 13 main shuruyaat se hi kuch contestants ke bich dosti kaa bahut gaharaa rishta ban gaya he
 Rashmi Desai and Devolina's friendship among them is the highest

 Both always support each other
 lekin shuukravaar ke episod main pehali baar devolina ko unki kareebi dost rashmi desai par bhadakte hue dekha gaya
 Why Devolina was angry at Rashmi? Actually, Shahnaz asks Binarashmi Desaiki to wear a sari
 shahanaz kaa ye bihaviour devolina ko bilkul pasand nahin aata he
 Rashmi's not saying anything to Shahnaz makes Devolina quite upset
 devolina rashmi se kahati hai ki wo shahanaz ko phayda uthaane de rahi hai or unhen khud ke liye stand lenaa chahie

 rajat sharma purv vitt mantri swargeey arun jetali kaa samarthan milane par cricket prashasan se jude the
 DDCA insiders believe that Sharma was weakened after Jaitley's demise, as the former finance minister was instrumental in keeping the various factions of the organization united

 Many of us buy microwave containers by seeing the 'safe' mark
 chunki inke back main sef mark hota he isliye ham nishcint bhi ho jate hai
 However, simply having it written on them is not a guarantee of being safe
 contanners main kameemicrowave contannersko prayog ke liye maanakon par khara paae jane ke baad hi inkaa prayog karen
 However, experts believe that containers with a thin plastic body are not safe, even if they have a safe mark
 kai adhyayanon main saamne aayaa he ki in contanners se BPA yani bisefnol a nikalataa he or jab inhen garm kiya jaataa he to vah bhojan main mil jaataa he
 Taking BPA in small amounts is very harmful and its effect lasts for a long time
 ab to ise bain karne kii maang bhi uth rahi he
 What is a better expert? Many plastic containers say that once used, they are not cleaned properly for the next use
 plastic kii kuch maatra bhojan main milti hi he
 Also, such containers, where detergent or paint, etc
 should be kept, should never be used for washing and keeping food
 bina oven ke banaaen nankhatai biscuit
 
 
 Use them to use coarse pottery for oven
 achche glassware main hi bhojan ko phir garm karen
 Avoid using decorative glass plates
