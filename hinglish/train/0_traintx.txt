 But during the delimitation in 2006, Bandhavgarh assembly seat was formed

 This time too, Savitri Singh is considered as the Congress candidate, but the question is whether she will stop the bjp's handicrack here? The Bandhavgarh Assembly seems to be surrounded by many problems
 bandhavgarh main sabase badi samasya he berogari
 Because there is a shortage of industry and employment resources

 The day could not have started better than this
 hazaribagh ke police prashikshan college main padhaane vaale chashmadhari mridubhashi rana visphotakon ko niskriy karne main maahir hai
 Deactivating the bomb in his state Jharkhand is a routine task
 pichley chaar saal yani 2008 se 2012 ke bich jab desh main barudi surang visphot se kii gai naksali hinsa se kul 3,659 mautein hui thim (surakshakarmiyon or nagarikon donon kii) to inamen se ek-chauthai akele jharkhand main hui thim
 However, this state is at number two as Chhattisgarh has suffered 1,244 deaths due to Naxal violence
 lekin chhattisgarh main jahaan maut kaa graph upar kii ore jaataa he, vahiin jharkhand main iskaa munh neeche kii ore he
 In 2008 there were 207 deaths while in 2012 the number came down to 162
 iskaa shrey kaaphi had tak is bam nirodhak daste ko bhi jaataa he jisane is avadhi main 2,000 se zyada barudi surangon ko niskriy kiya he
 Additional Director General of Police of Jharkhand S
 en
 Pradhan says, "our bomb disposal squad is our greatest strength in the war against extremists
 ” america main prashikshit rana bam nirodhak chah ikaayiyon main se ek kaa netritv karte hai
 When a phone call interrupted Rana's morning tea, it was for a job he was well aware of
 pradhan chaahate the ki rana team ke saath jaldi ranchi pahuchen kyonki unhen siarpief ke jawan babulal patel ke pet main taqatvar improvizd explosive divaais (iidi) hone kaa andeh tha
 When Pradhan entrusted this responsibility to Rana, he only mentioned the sanctity of the jawan's body but his message was clear that the dead body should be saved for the martyr's family
 29 varshiya patel un 10 javaanon main the jinhen lateher main katiyaa ke jangalon ke bheetar 7 janvari ko gher kar naksaliyon ne maar giraaya tha
 Patel returned from the holiday a week earlier
 police ko unke shav 9 janvari ko mil paae
 But the three villagers lost their lives when an IED in another body exploded
 ediji kaa phone aate hi rana ne jaldi se chaay ke ghunt gatke or apni team ke anya teen sadasyon ko phone kiya—43 varshiya sab inspector vijay ranjan, 42 varshiya sipaahi ashraf kuraishi or 35 varshiya abdul kareem
 He simply said, "get ready for rachi
 ” aadhe ghante main team hazaribagh se 100 kilometre dur ranchi ke liye ravaanaa ho chuki thi
 a night ago at the Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS) in Ranchi, when doctors were inspecting the dead bodies of martyred soldiers, they were shocked to see fresh stitches on Patel's stomach
 taankon ke paas koi sujan nahin thi yani ye taanke marane ke baad lagaae gaye the
 The corpses were placed in the open ground between the sacks of sand
 rana ne puraa muyna kiya lekin yah andaja lagaana mushkil tha ki ve jis visphotak se nibatane ja rahe the uski kshamta or unke bachane kii gunjaaish kya thi
 Obviously, the Naxalites must have taken a long time to cut off that part of the body and plant a bomb in it
 rana kii team is barbarta par hairaan thi
 For a moment Rana's mind got the attention of the widow of this martyred jawan and he turned his attention to his wife Savita, who cares for him, including the children
 tab laga ki parivaar ko unki kitni jarurat hogi
 But soon he removed this idea from his mind
 yah bhavuk hone kaa vakt nahin tha
 The team members shook hands with each other, then touched the earth to calm the shivering of the body at such a time
 bam visheshgyon ne is baat kii pushti kar di thi ki laash ke bheetar koi dhaatunuma badi cheez he
 The easiest way was to have a controlled blast, but also the responsibility of saving the body of the deceased for his family
 iske liye rana ko laash ke kareeb jaakar uske upar ek eks-re scinar rakhana tha or usase jude taar se ek laptop par dekhnaa tha ki andar kya he
 Rana decided that he would go to the body without wearing an anti-bomb suit
 ve jaanate the ki pressure-sensitive bamon se nibatane main 30 kilo kaa bam suut samasya paidaa kar saktaa he
 This was not the first time that Rana was ignoring two mandatory rules related to his work
 har bam nirodhak ko bataaya jaataa he ki use “shahid nahin hona he” or “doosraa mauka kabhi nahin miltaa
 "rana also knew how many bomb experts have lost their lives by ignoring these rules
 disambar 2012 kii hi baat he jab siarpief kaa bam visheshgy dog handler jo iidies kaa pataa lagaakar kai baar kai jaane bachaa chukaa tha, jharkhand kii jhumara paharipoon main apane snifer dog ke saath maaraa gaya tha kyonki sadak ko surakshit maanate hue usne apana suraksha kavach nikaal diya tha
 Often, members of the bomb disposal squad have to keep the rules under consideration, keeping in mind the situation
 aktubar 2012 main vishesh kaarybal ke 42 varshiya sab inspector rajesh kumaar ko palamu main 15 kilogram kii ek iidi apane haath main lekar ek kilometre tak janaa padaa tha kyonki vah ek bheedbhad vaale ilaake main mili thi jahaan use niskriy karnaa sambhav nahin tha
 He says, "I had to do this because the bomb had to be taken away from the crowd
" ” us samay rajesh kumaar ne bam nirodhak suut nahin pahana tha kyonki 30 kilo kaa suut unki raftaar ko roak rahaa tha
 On January 10, Rana faced a similar threat
 unhone eks-re scinar ko badi safai se laash par rakhaa
 What he saw with the help of the real time viewing system confirmed his apprehension
 iidi lohe ke ek dibbe main rakhi gai thi jo badariyon se judi thi or usamen ek dabamukt karne vaala upkaran or datonator bhi bandhaa hua tha
 The team discussed for 10 minutes, then decided to use the Cordex Water Charge
 yah bam ko niskriy karne kii ek aisi takanic hoti he jisamen pentaerithritol tetranitrate se bhare halke asar vaale datonating cord main niyantrit tareeke se torget ke kareeb visphot karaayaa jaataa he jisase kaaphi gati se pani kii bauchhaar pade or datonator cord bhig jaae
 a water splash is then released directly towards the target which cuts the circuit and neutralizes the bomb
 yahaan jarurat yah thi ki pani kii bauchhaar itani tej ho ki vah pehle taankon ko kaate or uske baad taron ko niskriy kare
 a small explosion was possible, unable to produce the speed of water equivalent to cutting both, while a large explosion could also explode the bomb
 rana ke liye yah dudhari talwaar par chalane jaisaa tha
 Bottles of water and some light explosives were placed on the corpse and a torrent of water was placed near it
 chaaron log dur hat gaye
 Suddenly there was a mild explosion and it happened as it should have
 pani ke jet ne taanke kaat die or circuit ko niskriy kar daalaa
 The Kore bomb was then removed by hand and detonated in a safe place
 khatra tal chukaa tha
 Rana turned on the phone, hooked up the wife and said, "hey, this was a daily job
" ”jharkhand ke bam nirodhak daste ko roj nai chunauti se guzarana hota he
 They are engaged in the task of neutralizing bombs and eliminating landmines in the most dangerous area of the country
 jharkhand police ke 24 bam nirodhak javaanon ko, jo alag-alag jagahon par tainaat hai, har duusare din kahin na kahin janaa hi padataa he
 However, Maoists are now inventing new methods of attack, due to which their work is becoming more challenging
 rana kehete hai, “hamen surakshit rahane ke liye charampanthiyon kii tarah sochna padataa he
 “for the last two years, there have been 1,198 deaths in Naxalite violence across the country, of which 367 have been reported in Jharkhand alone
 2006 main rana kii dekh-rekh main pehali bam nirodhak unit kaa gathan kiya gaya tha
 Since then, deaths in landmine explosions have decreased
 rana kii team ke sadsy ranjan kehete hai, “chota-sa visphot bhi bhuuchaal jaisaa dahalane vaala hota he
 The trees are uprooted and the roads slip a few meters away from their place

 Stand up comedian and Bollywood actor Kapil Sharma has accused BMC of demanding bribe
 yahi nahin, unhone iske saath hi sidhe pradhanmantri narendra modi ke 'achche dinon' par sawaal khadey kiye hai
 In such a situation, political voices have started to bind Kapil Sharma
 bijepi netaa jahaan unke bayaan kii ninda kar rahe hai, vahiin congress ne unka samarthan kiya he
 Senior Congress leader Rajiv Shukla said that gahe-baheghepil shame has been said by the general public
 'aaj tak' se khaas baatcheet main rajeev shukla ne kaha, 'kapil ke munh se sach niklaa he, jabaki bijepi ke netaa system ko thik karwaane kii bajaay gaali galoch kar rahe hai
 'question- Kapil Sharma has said that he has been paying 15 crore tax since last 5 years and BMC has demanded 5 lakh bribe from him to give approval to build office
 unke is bayaan ko aap kis dhang se dekhte hai?rajeev shukla- kapil sharma ke munh se sach nikal gaya aaj
 The general public is also feeling the same
 aam janata ke liye kamedi karte hai to unke munh se sach niklaa he
 This is the feeling of people everywhere
 har taraf log yahi maan rahe hai ki neeche kahin bhi bhrashtachar khatm nahin hua he
 People are kind of tight
 bajaay iske ki aap usko thik karavaaen or karen bijepi ke netaa kapil sharma ke upar tut pad rahe hai
 Are abusing yah thik nahin he
 You correct this, the atmosphere is going on, people are upset
 sawaal- manoj tiwari ne kaha he ki pradhanmantri par hamalaa karnaa thik nahin tha
 This is a cheap mentality
 kapil sharma ke achche din aae tabhi to vah tex pe kar rahe hai
 He should have brought the matter to the fore? Rajiv Shukla- BJP leaders have a BJP government there instead of falling on Kapil Sharma in this manner, so this way should not work there
 agar koi itnaa tex den rahe hai
 If someone is not giving it for 2 years, then even before that his program started in the Congress era
 tab bhi vah tex dete the
 But then nobody would take bribe from them
 is vakt ghoose kaa maahaul chal rahaa he
 The bribery environment is going on, so strict steps should be taken
 bajaay iske karne ke kapil sharma ko gaali galoch karen
 This is the biggest problem
 sawaal- manoj tiwari ne kaha he ki pradhanmantri par atake karnaa fishan ban gaya he
 Kejriwal has started this fashion? Kapil Sharma followed him
 rajeev shukla- uski tulana usase nahin kerani chahie
 Started fashion if any truth is dared
 yah bataaya he
 People silence and get their work done under compulsion
 agar usne bataaya he to us maamle main karrwai kerani chahie
 Instead of taking it as criticism
 usko aam aadmi kii aam janata kii jo philing he, us par dhyaan dena chahie
 Strict steps should be taken
 shaadi ke baad ke anubhav ke bare main sahi-sahi to aapako tabhi pataa chalegaa jab aapaki shaadi ho jaaegi
 But there are many things that every girl has to go through
 kai shaadishuda ladakiyon ke anubhav ke aadhaar par ham aapako kuch aisi hi baaten bataane ja rahe hai
 If you know about them before marriage, then it would be good
 1- aapke peeth peeche aapaki buraai honi tay he
 After going to the in-laws, you are tested on many parameters
 jaruri nahin ki aapaki taur tareeke sabko pasand aaen
 In such a situation, if the back is left behind, it will be good
 2- agar parivaar bada he to aap family politics ke liye taiyaar rahiye
 There is no need to fear and panic
 dhire-dhire aapako sabaki politics samaj main aa jaaegi
 3- You love your husband and your husband loves you, but his family also loves him, in such a situation there is a situation of conflict and estrangement at times
 gharelu maamalon main jaruri nahin he ki aapke pati hameshaa aapkaa hi saath den
 Girls should also be mentally prepared for this
 4- nae ghar main jane par nijee jivan main dakhal padataa he
 Now you also have to take care of the will of others
 parivaar main agar sadsy zyada hai to aapako personal spes milanaa or mushkil he
 These problems come in the early days of marriage! 5- Earlier you used to take care of money yourself and use it according to yourself
 lekin shaadi ke baad paison kaa maamla sirf aap tak simit nahin rah jaataa he
 6- Forget private space, now nothing remains private, at least your husband knows all the things
 yah pyaara bhi he lekin kai baar jhunjhalaahat kaa kaaran bhi ban saktaa he
 The bones of Indians are weaker than other countries, this is the reason 7- If you like different types of dishes, go well, now you may have to compromise a bit

 The same Hashim Ansari said, 'this issue will be decided by what Mahant ji will say

 Whether it is the leader of the Hindus or the Muslims, the decision will now be made with Mahant ji
 wo kahenge to main unke saath mukhyamantri or pradhanmantri se bhi milane chaluungaa
 Hashim Ansari's son Iqbal Ansari said on the matter, 'my father has met Mahant Gyanandas

 We are ready to compromise for the unity of the country
 ' gauratlab he ki pichley saal disambar main hashim ansaari ne is maamle se khud ko alag karne kii ichha jataai thi
 He then announced that his son Iqbal would now take over the case
 ikbaal ansaari ne daawa kiya ki adaalat ke baahar maamla sulajhane kii pahal pradhanmantri narendra modi se mulaakaat ke baad shuru hui he
 Iqbal said, Mahant Gyanandas will ask for an appointment with the Prime Minister and after that we will go to meet him
 ham is maamle ko bhaichaare ke saath niptaana chaahate hai
 The babri-ramjanmabhoomi case is currently being heard in the Supreme Court

 Maurya, who is trying to find a political option for himself, is going to meet BJP leaders here, but after leaving the BSP, his discussion of joining the SP, 'riding a bicycle'
 abhi tak is sawaal ko lekar atakalon kaa bazaar garm tha or charchaa yahaan tak thi kii maury na sirf samaajawaadee party kaa daaman thamenge, balki 27 june ko hone vaale akhilesh yadav ke mantrimandal pherbadal main mantri pad bhi paa sakate hai
 After leaving Swami Prasad Maurya Kebhujan Samaj Party, the way Akhilesh Yadav, Shivpal Yadav and Azam Khan praised him, these speculations got added to it
 akhilesh ne to maury ke liye yahaan tak kaha ki vah achche vyakti hai, lekin galat party main hai
 On the other hand, Mayawati's entire attempt to stop the vote of the party after the bsp's head OBC face is out
 maaya ne is babat party vidhayakon kii baithak bhi bulaai he
 The manner in which Maurya made a statement against Samajwadi Party on Thursday by SP, Maurya, made it clear that he wants to explore all options before riding a bicycle
 samaajawaadee party par sidhaa hamalaa bolte hue swami prasad maury ne kaha ki pichley 4 varshon se uttar pradesh main jis tarah araajaktaa or gundaraj chal rahaa he, use rokane kii jimmedaari samaajawaadee party ke netaaon kii he
 Maurya even said that whether it is the Samajwadi Party or the Bharatiya Janata Party, it is the responsibility of the leaders to rein in their people and see what is going on in the party
 maury ke is bayaan se sapa ke netaa hakke-bakke rah gaye
 a senior party leader said that by making such statements, Maurya is blocking the way of coming to the SP for himself
 ab is baat kii koi sambhaavna nahin he kii 27 taarikh ko hone vaale mantrimandal ke pherbadal main swami prasad maury party main shaamil hokar mantri banenge
 SP will be profitable for the SP, however, the Samajwadi Party leaders believe that if Maurya had joined his party, it would have been a good deal according to the mathematics of votes
 chunaav ke pehle sapa is koshish main juty hui he ki zyada se zyada pichhadi jatiyon ko party ke saath joda jaae
 This will reduce the edge of the charge against SP that it is a party of Yadavs only
 bataaya jaataa he ki isi koshish ke tahat benny prasad verma se lekar ajit singh tak se puraani dushmani bhuulakar dosti kaa haath badhaayaa gaya
 The Samajwadi Party leaders hope that Beni Prasad Verma will bring Kurmi votes with him and Ajit Singh with Jat votes
 swami prasad maury sapa ke liye kaam ke netaa ho sakate hai, kyonki jis kushvaha birdari se maury aate hai uskaa koi bada cheharaa samaajawaadee party ke paas nahin he
 The leaders of the BSP, who are bitter about Maurya in the SP, are also looking at how the BJP is preparing its strategy to connect the backward castes
 keshav prasad maury ko uttar pradesh main bijepi kii bagdor dekar usne apni apni manshaa saaf kar di he
 But the senior SP minister says that there is not such a big leader that Arju should be requested to bring him into the party
 sabhi is baat ko jaanate hai ki vah apane vidhansabha chunaav kii haar gaye the or baad main upachunaav main hi jeet paae
 After the power show, the BJP will decide the opposite side, Swami Prasad is also in touch with Maurya BJP leaders and can also visit BJP leaders in Delhi
 ek july ko maury ne lakhanu main apane samarthakon kii baithak bulaai he
 It is also considered to be his power show
 agar samarthan acha mila to swami prasad maury apni party bhi bana sakate hai taaki unki sthiti majboot ho or moltol karke vah baad main bijepi yaa sapa se ja milen
 Maurya feels that by taking a hasty step, he will not be able to negotiate properly
 samaajawaadee party philhal unase aage badhkar baatcheet karne ke mood main nahin he
 Now everything will depend on how much support they get and how much preference is given to them in their interactions with the BJP
 pradhanmantri usoof raja gilaani ne pakistan main jald aam chunaav hone kii sambhaavna jataane ke saath hi kaha he ki vah is masale par apane sahyogiyon tathaa vipaksh se baatcheet karenge

 ' The Supreme Court has said that every kind of reservation should be removed from higher educational institutions in the national interest
 supreme court ne is baat par dukh jataayaa ki aazaadee ke 68 varshon baad bhi kuch visheshadhikaar nahin badale hai
 The court has asked the central government to take a fair decision for this
 justise deepak mishra or pisi pant kii peeth ne mangalvaar ko ek maamle kii sunwaayee main kaha ki centre or rajya sarkaron ko super-speshiality course main merit ke hi aadhaar par daakhila dene ke kai remaidar dene ke baavjood aisa nahin ho sakaa he
 The bench said that even in such courses, reservation often exceeds merit
 bench ne yah bhi kaha ki vah 1988 main supreme court ke die do faislon se puri tarah se sahamat he
 In these decisions on reservation in admissions in super-specialty courses in medical institutions, the Supreme Court had said, 'there should be no reservation' because improving the standard of higher education will be in the national interest
 isi ke saath desh ke logon ko milane vaali swasthya sevaaon kii gunvattta bhi sudharegi

 bench kaa kahana tha ki aise corson main bhi aksar hi yogyata par aarakshan baari pad jaataa he
 The bench also said that it fully agreed with the two decisions of the Supreme Court in 1988
 chikitsa sansthaanon main super-speshiality course main daakhile main aarakshan par die in faislon main supreme court ne kaha tha, 'koi aarakshan nahin hona chahie' kyonki ucch shiksha kaa str sudhaarna deshhit main hoga
 With this, the quality of health services provided to the people of the country will also improve

 atal bihari vaajapeyi ko bos ke darje main rakh paanaa mushkil or iske baavjood aasaan bhi he
 The first thing i had to understand — and it took me a very long time to do so — was that they had to accept their limitations
 kuch samay baad hi mujhe yah ehsaas hua ki unhen kuch bhram the, saath hi ve jabardast aatmavishvaas se bhare the
 It was not an easy task in the beginning, because they were very happy in their silence and i kept thinking about what i was expected to do
 june 1996 main yah khaasaa mushkil ho gaya, jab ve loksabhaa main vipaksh ke netaa bane
 It was barely two weeks since i joined him
 mujhe ek anjaan ilaake main dhakel diya gaya tha
 Never before had an IAS officer been working as the secretary of the Leader of the Opposition
 chota-sa daftar tha or ghar se kaam karte hue usamen ve, main or ek teesraa nichalaa karinda tha jo phone sunata tha
 Slowly things came to a standstill
 main unke paas aane vaali kuchhek sau chitthiyaan padhata tha, jinhen main jawaab dene laayak samajhataa tha unke jawaab taiyaar karata tha or baaki chitthiyon ko sambandhit sarkari mahakamon ko bhej detaa tha
 They used to write the answers of the most important letters by hand, and many times i used to write on the answers that i prepared
 unhen kisi na kisi aayojan main mukhya atithi ke taur par bulaayaa hi jaataa tha, isliye mujhe unke bhaashan bhi likhane hote the
 i remember a special event that was at the Center for Science and the Environment; He rejected all my drafts, finally told me that i was writing essays, not speeches
 unhone kai badlaav kiye or bhaashan bahut acha ban gaya
 This was a lesson for me
 dhire-dhire mujhe ehsaas hua ki shant or aksar uninde haav-bhav ke peeche is sajag shaks kaa lagaataar kadi mehnat se soch rahaa dimag he jise ahm muddon par aasaani se santusht nahin kiya ja saktaa
 The brief account of the 200-page country prepared by the Ministry of External Affairs was assimilated in just one evening
 isse meraa jeena mushkil ho jaataa kyonki iskaa matlab tha ki mujhe bhi padhuya padataa tha
 He was the one with the "big picture" in mind, but there were also those who could capture links between seemingly unconnected things
 choti se choti baat bhi unki najar se batch nahin paati thi
 This would have been clearer when he had a speech recorded for TV
 ve ricarding ko kai baar dohraane ko taiyaar rahete the, jab tak ki usamen ek bhi khami baaki na bache
 This endless patience did not mean that he did not step too fast, sensing the opportunity
 lahore kii jis yatra ne atomi takat se las bharat ko dekhne kaa duniya kaa andaaj badal diya, vah hui hi na hoti agar unhone navaj sharif ke ek intervyuu kii us baat ko jhapat nahin liya hota, jisamen unhone kaha tha ki lahore main shri vaajapeyi kii mejabani karke unhen behad khushi hogi
 The Ministry of External Affairs had suggested to react only after receiving the formal invitation, but in contrast Vajpayee said that he would be happy to go to Lahore
 vaise is yatra kaa nateeja kargil kii jang tha, par yah makasad hasil kar liya gaya ki pakistan ke saath bharat kaa sambandh apni sharton par hoga
 On other occasions, however, he was ready to listen fully to all sides
 bos ke taur par unki jo baat mujhe yaad he, vah roj subah ke naashte par hone vaali baatcheet thi, jisamen brajesh mishra or ashok saciya hameshaa hote the
 Everyone read the newspaper, important things were discussed, perseverance but humility was made, the agenda of the day was decided, and everyone had to return and report in the evening
 yah sab khaasaa maathapai vaala or loktantric tha, par aakhri faisla vahi lete
 They do not need to assert their rights, but it is a mistake to assume that they cannot assert their rights

 hindu dharm main shiv-parvati, vishnu-lakshmi, ram-sita, radha-krishna kii kai prem kathaayen kahi gai hai
 But there is a story that you have hardly heard
 yah kahani he bhagwaan ganesh or tulsi kii
 Ganeshji, considered a destroyer of obstacles, had once rejected Tulsi's love and cursed him with anger
 katha kuch yun he
 One day Tulsinadi was walking on the shore
 vahaan unhone ek vyakti ko tapasya main leen dekha
 He was Lord Ganesha
 tapasya ke kaaran ek tejasvi oj unke mukh par tha, jisase tulsi unki ore aakarshith ho gayi
 Tulsi had given marriage proposal to him and proposed marriage in front of him
 parganesh jeene badi shaleenta se unke prem prastaav ko asweekaar kar diya
 He said that he would marry a girl who had the same qualities as his mother Parvati
 yah sunate hi tulsi ko krodh aa gaya
 He considered it an insult and cursed Ganesha that his marriage would be contrary to his will
 unhen kabhi maa parvati ke samatuly jeevansangini nahin milegi
 The Ganesh festival celebrated with great pomp in Karachi was the birth of Priya of Lord Krishna
 
 
 ganesh ji kaa tha yah shrapayah sunate hi ganesh ji ko bhi krodh aa gaya
 He also cursed Tulsi that he would be married to a demon
 iske baad tulsi ko apni galati kaa abhas hua
 He apologized to Ganesha
 ganesh ji ne unhen maaf karte hua kaha ki ve ek poojaneey paudha banengi
 But Tulsi will never be used in their worship
 baad main tulsi kaa vivaah shankhachud naamak asur se hua, jise jalandhar ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he

 Harshvardhan could not get a majority for the BJP, but he got the most seats in his account

 The results of the Jharkhand and Jammu and Kashmir assembly elections have arrived
 jharkhand membijapi kamobesh satta mena gai he, lekin jise purna bahumat kaha jaataa he vaise dhang se nahin
 In Jammu and Kashmir, the party fought fiercely and made its way into the Jammu region, but did not get a single seat in the valley
 jabaki chunaav prachaar ke dauraan aisa lag rahaa tha ki party is baar ghati main bhi apana paracham laharaa degi
 But even after all the noise, the party did not get the first place, far from majority
 ghati kii tamaam siten duusari partiyon ko chali gayi
 Mufti Saeed's party PDP performed brilliantly this time, but she too stayed away from the majority
 vaise pidipi sabase bada dal hone ke kaaran sarkaar banane kii sthiti main he
 However, now it depends on whom she forms the government with help
 bijepi ke haav-bhav or tevar se to aisa nahin lagata ki vah pidipi ke saath milakar sarkaar banaaegi
 Yet nothing can be said with certainty in politics
 baharhaal, ab vakt he yah samiksha karne kaa ki kyapiem modi kaa magicchala yaa nahin
 If we look carefully, the party performed well in the Lok Sabha elections in Jharkhand, it could not repeat it in the assembly
 us samay party ne 14 main se 12 siten jitkar sabhi ko hairaan kar diya tha
 But this time JMM stopped him to a great extent
 isi tarah jammu-kashmir kii 6 siton main se bijepi ne aadhi yani 3 siten jiti thim or pidipi ne bhi 3
 But now BJP does not show that effect here
 yah giravat kyon ai, yah shodh kaa vishay he
 Is the public not happy with the bjp's performance so far or is there some other reason? If one looks at the crowd at Modi's meetings, it would seem that his magic is intact, but the results do not say so
 in donon rajyon main alpsankhyakon kii taadaad kaaphi he
 There are many seats in Jharkhand where Christians have a significant population
 pichley kuch samay se aresas or anya hinduvadi sanghathan jis tarah se dharmantaran kii baaten kar rahe the or abhiyaan ched rahe the usase vahaan ke logon kaa bijepi ke prati mohabhang hua
 He is impressed by PM Modi's development slogan, but also nervous by organizations like RSS
 yahi baat jammu-kashmir ke bare main sach hoti he jahaan muslim aabaadi kahin zyada he
 In both these states, matters like conversion were keeping voters away from BJP
 tathakthith hindutv unhen bhaybheet karata he or ve vikalp kii talash karte hai
 This is the reason that despite all the allegations of corruption against JMM in Jharkhand, the party did not let its position deteriorate
 yah nishkarsh bahes kaa vishay ho saktaa he, lekin itnaa tay he ki voter kuch soch kar hi bijepi ke utane najadik nahin gaye jitna party ummid kar rahi thi
 If there is no decrease in the popularity of PM Modi, then there is definitely a reason behind it

 mumbai main varsh 1993 main hue bam visphoton se jude maamle main doshi tehraae jane ke baad paanch saal karawas kii sajaa kaat rahe bollywood abhinayta sanjay dutt ne spasht kiya he ki unhone na to swayan kabhi maharashtra ke rajyapal se maafee kii apil kii or na hi kabhi kisi se unki ore se aisa karne kaa anurodh kiya
 In a statement released on Friday, Sanjay Dutt's lawyers Hitesh Jain and Subhash Jadhav said that recent articles stated that the Maharashtra governor had turned down his plea for amnesty to the actor
 unhone kaha ki yah lekh supreme court ke sevanivrutt nyaayadhish markandeya katju ke ek nivedan par aadhaarit hai, jisamen unhone dutt or maamle ke anya doshiyon ke liye maafee kii apil kii he
 The statement said, Sanjay Dutt or his family members did not give any petition to the governor regarding the apology
 iske alaava sanjay dutt yaa unke parijan ne dutt kii ore se maafee ke vaaste aavedan dene ke liye supreme court ke purv nyaayadhish katju se kabhi sampark nahin kiya
 He said, Justice Katju has made this request not only to Dutt, but also to the other convicts of the case including Jabunnisa Kazi
 bayaan main kaha gaya he ki sanjay dutt ne apni sajaa lagbhag puri kar lee he or unhen jald hi reeha kar diya janaa chahie
 Katju had petitioned Maharashtra Governor c Vidyasagar Rao to cancel the remaining sentence of Sanjay Dutt
 unhone kaha tha ki sanjay aatankwaadi nahin hai, unhone keval galati kii thi
 Rao's plea for amnesty was rejected two days ago following the advice of Maharashtra Home Department
 vibhaag ne apni sifarish main kaha tha ki sanjay dutt kii sajaa maaf karne se ek galat udhaaharan pesh hoga
 Sanjay Dutt, 56, was convicted in 2007 by a special TADA court under the Arms Act on weapons possession and sentenced to five years rigorous imprisonment
 dutt ne 1996 main apni giraftaar ke baad 18 maheene jail main kaate the
 The actor surrendered after the Supreme Court upheld the conviction and sentence in May 2013
 uske baad se vah pune kii yarvada jail main band hai
 After being sent to Yerwada Jail in Pune in May 2013, Sanjay has come out of jail twice on parole and twice on furlough
 sanjay aktubar 2013 main 14 din ke liye farlo par jail se baahar aae or phir yah avadhi ek pakhwaade ke liye badha di gai
 In January 2014, Sanjay's 30-day payroll was also extended for another 30 days
 disambar 2014 main unhen 14 din kii farlo di gai thi
 Since 27 August 2015, he is once again on furlough
 sanjay kareeb 30 maah salaakhon ke peeche bitaa chuke hai
 He will be released after completion of his sentence in February 2016
 tippaniyan In the petition, Katju had said, "the only charge for which Sanjay has been convicted is the charge that he kept a prohibited weapon
" ’’ unhone is baat par bhi jor diya ki vah ucchtam nyaayalay ke faisle par sawaal nahin uthaa rahe hai
 Katju wrote that the five-year sentence for possessing weapons is correct, but Sanjay, after sentencing, spent 18 months behind bars in March 2013 and paid a substantial penalty, so the case was amnesty
 sanjay dutt ke vakeelon hitesh jain or subhash jadhav ne shuukravaar ko jari ek bayaan main kaha ki haalia lekhon main yah kaha gaya he ki maharashtra ke rajyapal ne abhinayta ko maafee die jane kii unki apil thukraa di he
 He said the article was based on a request by retired Supreme Court Judge Markandey Katju, in which he appealed for amnesty for Dutt and other convicts of the case
 bayaan main kaha gaya he, sanjay dutt yaa unke parivaar ke sadasyon ne maafee maange jane ke sambandh main rajyapal ko koi yachika nahin di
 Apart from this, Sanjay Dutt or his family never approached Katju, a former Supreme Court judge, to file an application for forgiveness on behalf of Dutt
 unhone kaha, nyaayamurti katju ne keval dutt hi nahin, balki jabunnisa kaaji samet maamle ke anya doshiyon ke liye bhi swayan yah nivedan kiya he
 The statement said that Sanjay Dutt has almost completed his sentence and he should be released soon
 katju ne maharashtra ke rajyapal si vidyasagar raav ko sanjay dutt kii shesh sajaa radd karne ke sambandh main yachika di thi
 He had said that Sanjay is not a terrorist, he only made a mistake
 raav ne maharashtra ke grih vibhaag kii salaah ke baad maafee kii yachika do din pehle khaarij kar di thi
 The department in its recommendation had said that waiving the sentence of Sanjay Dutt would set a wrong example
 56-varshiya sanjay dutt ko tada kii ek vishesh adaalat ne hathiyaar rakhane ke maamle main shastr kanoon ke tahat 2007 main doshi tehraaya tha or unhen paanch varsh kade karawas kii sajaa sunai thi
 After his arrest in 1996, Dutt spent 18 months in jail
 supreme court dwaara may, 2013 main doshasiddhi or sajaa ko barkaraar rakhe jane ke baad abhinayta ne aatmasamarpan kar diya tha
 He has since been lodged in Yerwada Jail in Pune
 sanjay may 2013 main pune kii yarvada jail bheje jane ke baad do baar perol par or do baar farlo par jail se baahar aa chuke hai
 Sanjay came out of jail on furlough for 14 days in October 2013 and then this period was extended for a fortnight
 janvari 2014 main sanjay kii 30 din kii perol bhi anya 30 dinon ke liye badha di gai thi
 In December 2014, he was given a 14-day furlough
 27 agast 2015 se vah ek baar phir farlo par hai
 Sanjay has spent nearly 30 months behind bars
 farvari 2016 main sajaa puri hone ke baad vah reeha kiye jaaenge
 The comments yachika main katju ne kaha tha, ‘‘jis ekmaatr aarope ke liye sanjay ko doshi tehraaya gaya he vah aarope he ki unhone ek pratibandhit hathiyaar apane paas rakhaa tha
 He also emphasized that he is not questioning the Supreme Court verdict
 katju ne likhaa ki hathiyaar rakhane ke liye paanch saal kii sajaa sahi he lekin sanjay ne sajaa sunaae jane se pehle, march 2013 main 18 maah salaakhon ke peeche bitaa kar paryaapt dand bhugta he isliye yah maamla maafee ke anukool he
 The statement said, Sanjay Dutt or his family members did not give any petition to the governor regarding the apology
 iske alaava sanjay dutt yaa unke parijan ne dutt kii ore se maafee ke vaaste aavedan dene ke liye supreme court ke purv nyaayadhish katju se kabhi sampark nahin kiya

 The meeting was canceled

 The BJP and the Aam Aadmi Party are once again facing the minimum wage in the capital Delhi
 bijepi saansad ramesh bidhudi ne kaha he ki unke skool main dilli sarkaar ne isliye red karai kyonki vah apane mantri or vidhayakon ke khilaaf manahani kaa cese rafa dfa karana chaahati he
 Recently, the government of the Aam Aadmi Party conducted raids in all the companies, schools and hospitals of Delhi for the investigation of minimum wage
 baad menam aadmi party press conference kar bijepi ke kai purv saansadon or south dilli se saansadarmesh bidhudike skool ke khilaaf media main dastavej jari kiye the
 The Aam Aadmi Party said that BJP MP Bidhuri is not even giving minimum wages by getting poor laborers working in their schools
 is maamle parabijepisansad ramesh bidhudi ne palatwaar karte hue kaha he kickejarivalsarkaar lagaataar apane mantri or vidhayakon ke jariye manahani ke cese ko rafa dfa karaane ke liye dabaav bana rahi he
 This is the reason that fake raid was conducted in his school in Sangam Vihar
 bidhudi ne yah bhi aarope lagaaya ki adhikariyon ke jariye jhooth failaane kii koshish kii gai ki garib mazdooron se jabaran kaam karaayaa ja rahaa he or nunatam vetan bhi nahin diya ja rahaa
 Bidhuri said that the manner in which the raid was conducted in her school by citing the Child Act is completely wrong
 saath hi unke skool main garib tabake ke bacchon ko muft main shiksha di jaati he, lekin kejariwal sarkaar galat manshaa se unhen nishaanaa bana rahi he

 aantarik prajatantr or vaishvik jimmedaari ke dharaatal par pakistan se koi tulana nahin ho sakati
 Democracy is real and fully established in India, whereas Pakistan is just a sham
 iske alaava uski pahchaan aatankwaadi mulk ke rup main ban chuki he, jahaan aatanki sanghathanon ko khuli panaah milti he
 Almost all the terrorist activities going on in the world are connected to Pakistan in one way or the other
 pakistan kii yah hakeekat ek baar phir ujagar hui
 Had there been a responsible country, it would have proceeded in accordance with the good promise made by its elected Prime Minister
 kuch dinon pehle hi upha main navaj sharif ne apane bhartiya samakaksh se vaada kiya tha ki pakistan seemaa par sangharshaviram kaayam rakhega
 In view of this, there will be talks of national security consultants of both the countries
 vastut: iskaa prastaav narendra modi ne kiya tha
 This proposal was in line with India's traditional policy
 modi ne shapath grahan ke avasar par saarc deshon ke shaskaon ko bulaayaa tha
 Its message was clear
 modi bataanaa chaahate the ki bharat apane sabhi padosi deshon ke saath shanti or sauhardpurn sambandh chahta he
 Even at that time, Sharif had praised Modi's efforts, promising cooperation on his behalf
 lekin pakistan lautne ke baad navaj sharif apana vaada nahin nibhaa sake
 The army stopped him from normalizing relations with India
 pakistan ke saath yahi sabase badi samasya he
 The main talks with other countries take place between those in power
 yah nirnay sena nahin karti
 Neither the Prime Minister or the President of any country talks bilaterally with the Pakistan Army Chief
 vaarta to pakistani pradhanmantri se hoti he
 It is on this basis that what will be done in the direction of normalization of relations
 lekin pakistan kii hakeekat sabhi prayaason par pani pher detii he
 India is not the only one troubled by this problem
 yah sanyog tha ki jis samay pakistan rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar str kii vaarta ke maddenjar apana rang dikhaa rahaa tha, usee samay navaj sharif kii oktober main america yatra kaa prastaav banaaya ja rahaa tha
 On this, many responsible senior officials of the US said that the proposed dialogue between Nawaz Sharif and US President Obama cannot be expected much
 iskaa kaaran he ki pakistani pradhanmantri un baton par aage nahin bad sakate, jin par vah sheersh vaarta kii mej par sahmati vyakt kar chuke hote hai
 He returns to his country and becomes in the army's mercy
 tab khaastaur par videsh niti par unka niyantran nahin rah gaya
 This is the problem with steps to improve relations with Pakistan
 yah samasya bharat kii jimmedaari badha detii he
 We will have to ensure security at the border, respond to Pakistani antics
 iskaa doosraa koi vikalp nahin he
 Apart from this, it will also have to discharge its obligations in line with India's global reputation
 modi kaa apane shapath grahan samaaroh main navaj sharif ko bulaanaa tathaa upha main unke saath vaarta karnaa unheen dayitvon kaa nirvaah tha
 The elected Prime Minister in India represents the nation globally
 vah jo vaada karte hai, uske nirvaah kii haisiyat main hote hai
 Modi promised to start the talks
 iske baad hi unhone rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar ajit dobhaal ko dwipaksheeya vaarta kii taiyaari karne kaa nirdesh diya
 Doval had made full preparations before the talks
 bataaya jaataa he ki unhone kisi bhi bindu ko choda nahin tha
 All the questions were prepared which had to be put before Pakistan
 itnaa hi nahin, un sambhavit prashnon kaa jawaab bhi taiyaar kiya gaya tha, jinhen pakistani paksh uthaa saktaa tha
 Such extensive preparations were made because the Indian Prime Minister had promised it to the Pakistani counterpart
 bharat ke prajatantr kii vaastaviktaa or gahari jadon kaa isse anumaan lagaaya ja saktaa he
 On the other side, is Pakistan
 upha main navaj sahamat hue the ki aatankwaad rokane par rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar str kii vaarta hogi, tathaa is vaarta main kashmir kaa masalaa nahin uthaaya jayega
 It is interesting to see what kind of preparations Pakistani officials were making on Nawaz Sharif's promise
 unki taiyaari apane hi pradhanmantri kii baton ko dhwast karne ke liye chal rahi thi
 Sharif had said that Kashmir would not be discussed, his officials were proposing to raise the issue of Kashmir and meet Hurriyat leaders
 yah shararti taiyaari thi
 India had postponed the secretary-level talks due to Pakistani attempts to negotiate with the separatists
 jaahir he ki pakistani adhikari jaanboojhkar vaarta ko rokane kaa plan bana chuke the
 The comments vaarta par pani pherane kii pakistani chaal ke peeche is baar do pramukh kaaran the
 The traditional and second was the immediate cause
 paramparaagat kaaran yah tha ki sena desh ke nirvaachit pradhanmantri ko uski aukaat bataanaa chaahati thi
 She wanted to tell that the Prime Minister's promises could be mixed to dust
 sena kaa nirnay sarvocch hota he
 The immediate reason is that Pakistani National Security Advisor Sartaj Aziz was not in a position to face Indian counterpart Ajit Dhoval
 pakistan kii is hakeekat ko sweekaar karte hue hamen apni simaaon kii suraksha sunishchit kerani hogi
 This reality of Pakistan was exposed once again
 koi jimmedaar mulk hota to apane nirvaachit pradhanmantri dwaara kiye gaye achche vaade ke anuroop aage badhata
 Just a few days ago in Ufa, Nawaz Sharif promised his Indian counterpart that Pakistan would maintain a ceasefire along the border
 iske maddenjar donon deshon ke rashtriya suraksha salahakaaron kii vaarta hogi
 In fact, it was proposed by Narendra Modi
 yah prastaav bharat kii paramparaagat niti ke anuroop tha
 Modi had called the rulers of SAARC countries on the occasion of his swearing-in
 iskaa sandesh saaf tha
 Modi wanted to tell that India wants peace and amicable relations with all its neighbors
 us samay bhi sharif ne modi ke prayaason kii saraahna kii thi, apni taraf se sahyog kaa vaada kiya tha
 But Nawaz Sharif could not keep his promise after returning to Pakistan
 sena ne unhen bharat ke saath sambandh saamaanya banane se roak diya
 This is the biggest problem with Pakistan
 duusare deshon ke saath mukhya vaarta satta main baithe logon ke bich hoti he
 The army does not make this decision
 na kisi desh kaa pradhanmantri yaa raashtrapati pakistani sena pramukh se dwipaksheeya vaarta karata he
 The talks are with the Pakistani Prime Minister
 usee aadhaar par tay hota he ki sambandhon ko saamaanya banane kii disha main kya kiya jayega
 But Pakistan's reality undermines all efforts
 is samasya se keval bharat hi pareshaan nahin he
 It was a coincidence that Nawaz Sharif's visit to the US was being made in October at the time when Pakistan was showing its color in view of the National Security Advisor level talks
 is par america ke hi kai jimmedaar varisht adhikariyon kaa kahana tha ki navaj sharif or america raashtrapati obama ke bich prastaavit vaarta se khaas ummid nahin kii ja sakati
 The reason for this is that the Pakistani Prime Minister cannot proceed on things on which he has agreed at the top negotiating table
 vah apane desh main lautakar sena ke rahamokaram main ho jate hai
 Then he did not lose control over foreign policy in particular
 pakistan ke saath sambandh sudhaarney vaale kadamon main yahi samasya he
 This problem increases the responsibility of India
 hamako seemaa par suraksha sunishchit kerani hogi, pakistani harkaton kaa makul jawaab dena hoga
 There is no other option
 iske alaava bharat kii vaishvik pratishtha ke anuroop apane dayitvon kaa nirvaah bhi karnaa hoga
 Modi's calling of Nawaz Sharif at his swearing-in ceremony and negotiating with him in Ufa was the same responsibility
 bharat main nirvaachit pradhanmantri raashtra kaa vaishvik str par pratinidhitiv karte hai

 The immediate reason is that Pakistani National Security Advisor Sartaj Aziz was not in a position to face Indian counterpart Ajit Dhoval
 pakistan kii is hakeekat ko sweekaar karte hue hamen apni simaaon kii suraksha sunishchit kerani hogi
 The army does not make this decision
 na kisi desh kaa pradhanmantri yaa raashtrapati pakistani sena pramukh se dwipaksheeya vaarta karata he
 The talks are with the Pakistani Prime Minister
 usee aadhaar par tay hota he ki sambandhon ko saamaanya banane kii disha main kya kiya jayega
 But Pakistan's reality undermines all efforts
 is samasya se keval bharat hi pareshaan nahin he
 It was a coincidence that Nawaz Sharif's visit to the US was being made in October at the time when Pakistan was showing its color in view of the National Security Advisor level talks
 is par america ke hi kai jimmedaar varisht adhikariyon kaa kahana tha ki navaj sharif or america raashtrapati obama ke bich prastaavit vaarta se khaas ummid nahin kii ja sakati
 The reason for this is that the Pakistani Prime Minister cannot proceed on things on which he has agreed at the top negotiating table
 vah apane desh main lautakar sena ke rahamokaram main ho jate hai
 Then he did not lose control over foreign policy in particular
 pakistan ke saath sambandh sudhaarney vaale kadamon main yahi samasya he
 This problem increases the responsibility of India
 hamako seemaa par suraksha sunishchit kerani hogi, pakistani harkaton kaa makul jawaab dena hoga
 There is no other option
 iske alaava bharat kii vaishvik pratishtha ke anuroop apane dayitvon kaa nirvaah bhi karnaa hoga
 Modi's calling of Nawaz Sharif at his swearing-in ceremony and negotiating with him in Ufa was the same responsibility

 This time there were two major reasons behind the Pakistani move to sabotage the talks
 paramparaagat or doosraa tatkaalik kaaran tha
 The traditional reason was that the army wanted to tell the country's elected prime minister its status
 vah bataanaa chaahati thi ki pradhanmantri ke vaadon ko dhul main milaayaa ja saktaa
 The decision of the army is supreme
 taatkaalik kaaran yah ki pakistani rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar sartaaj ajij bhartiya samakaksh ajit dhobhaal kaa saamana karne kii sthiti main hi nahin the

 This time, BJP is going to give ticket to Pankaj Singh, son of Home Minister Rajnath Singh and General Secretary in UP BJP in Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections
 party ne pankaj singh ke saamne gajiabad kii sahibabad seat, noida, chandauli yaa mughalsarai seat se chunaav ladane kaa vikalp dene ke saath yah bhi kaha he ki ve jis seat chunaav ladanaa chaahaten hai party ko bataa sakate hai
 It was also in the year 2012 that the party had considered giving ticket to Pankaj Singh in the 2012 assembly elections also
 tab rajnath singh ne hi pankaj singh ko tikat nahin dene diya tha
 He believed that this would send a wrong message to the party workers
 uske baad pankaj singh upi kii raajnneeti main phir se sakriy ho gaye or party ne unhen upi bijepi kaa mahasachiv banaakar ek nai jimmedaari bhi di
 Senior leaders of the party say that Pankaj Singh is being given the ticket as a responsible general secretary of the party instead of being the son of Home Minister Rajnath Singh
 iske alaava ve ek lokapriy yuva netaa bhi hai
 Dayashankar's wife Swati Singh will also get a ticket: On the other hand, Swati Singh, the wife of Dayashankar Singh, who made a controversial statement on Mayawati, has also decided to give the ticket
 party ke netaaon kahana he ki jis tarah se us vakt swati singh nabspi ke netaonke bayanon ko aade haathon liya
 Many leaders from Mayawati to the BSP have retaliated by making PM Narendra Modi and Amit Shah so proud that Swati Singh was made the President of UP BJP Mahila Morcha
 isse yah saaf hota he ki party main is baar bhi tikat dete samaybhai-bhatijavadka naa sirf dhyaan rakhaa jaayegaa balki surakshit siton se tikat bhi diya jaayegaa
 Meanwhile, PM Modi's statement that he gave in bjp's national executive is that no one should recommend for the ticket of his son, daughter-in-law or relative

 The controversy over the post of Sana Ganguly, the daughter of Dada's entry into the citizenship amendment law, Sana Ganguly's post was linked to the opposition of the CAA, with Saurav protesting against the Citizenship Amendment Act in many parts of the country
 is kanoon kaa virodh har tabake ke log kar rahe hai
 Sana Ganguly, daughter of former captain of the Indian cricket team and BCCI President Sourav Ganguly, also wrote a post in protest against which there was controversy
 ganguli ne apni beti kaa bachaav kiya or raajnneeti ke liye use abhi chota bataaya, lekin ganguli ke is tarah beti kaa bachaav karne ko bhavishya kii unki raajnneetik mahatvakanksha se joda ja rahaa he
 What does Sana Ganguly's post say? Sourav Ganguly's daughter Sana posted a story on her Instagram, sharing an anecdote from Khushwant Singh's book The End of India that questions power, racial discrimination 
 isi ko naagarikta sanshodhan kanoon se joda gaya or soshal media par bavaal ho gaya
 Sourav Ganguly tweeted about this and defended the daughter saying that she is too young for political understanding
 vayask beti kii samaj par ganguli ke sawaal?saurav ganguli kii beti sanaa ganguli kii umr 18 saal he, unka janm 3 november 2001 ko hua
 In legal terms, Sana Ganguly is an adult and can take her own decisions
 lekin jis tarah saurav ganguli ne unke post ko raajnneeti ke hisaab se nasamajhi bataaya he, usapar bhi sawaal khadey hote hai
 It is also worth noting that at the age of 18, one can get the right to vote in India, that is, the Constitution also believes that at this age the political front matures and the youth can choose their public representatives and government
 lekin ganguli kaa tark isse mail nahin khaataa
 Ganguly's defense, thinking of the future? For a long time, there have been speculations that Sourav Ganguly could be the face of the Bharatiya Janata Party for the post of Chief Minister of Bengal
 haalanki, donon pakshon kii ore se isko nakaara jaataa rahaa he, lekin kayaas jari hai
 Recently when Sourav Ganguly became the President of BCCI, Jai Shah, son of Home Minister and BJP President Amit Shah, became Secretary in BCCI
 isi ke baad bijepi or saurav ganguli ke bich badhate rishton par charchaa hui
 Now that the opposition to the Citizenship Amendment Act in the country is in full swing and every opposition leader is calling on the Modi government to be declared anti-constitution
 aise main saurav ganguli kii beti kii taraf se post aana unke bhavishya ke raajnneetik debyue par pani pher saktaa he
 Assembly elections are due in Bengal in 2021 and Ganguly's tenure as BCCI president is only 9 months old
 haal hi main bhaajapa or centre sarkaar ke saath achche hote rishton ko saurav ganguli is tarah ek instagram post se bigaadna nahin chahenge
 That is why he is strongly calling the Instagram post of the daughter different from the CAA
 bengal main dada ban sakate hai king?pashchim bengal main mamata banerjee abhi mukhyamantri hai
 The Bharatiya Janata Party is preparing for the election against him, but he still needs a big face in the state
 siyaasi jaankaron kii nazar main saurav ganguli wo jagah le sakate hai
 Sourav Ganguly, popularly known as Prince of Kolkata, Bengal Tiger, is still a big brand in Bengal, which BJP would like to take advantage of
 haalanki, haal hi main kendriya grih mantri or bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah ne kaha tha ki abhi aise kisi plan ke liye saurav ganguli se unki party ne baat nahin kii he or naa hi ganguli kii ore se aisi koi ichha prakat kii gai he
