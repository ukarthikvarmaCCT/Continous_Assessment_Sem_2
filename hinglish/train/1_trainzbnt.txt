 a brigade is brewing in Pakistan against India, which is battling terrorism every day, which has already made preparations to destroy India in the coming days
 is brigade kaa naam he- 'ladi brigade'
 If these women fidayeen, with guns in their hands and poison in their minds, have succeeded in their intentions, India will be shocked
 iesai, pakistan fouj or aatankwaadi sanghathanon kii aguwai main pakistan main training 'ladi brigade' kii training chal rahi he
 Taking training in seven different camps of Pakistan, these girls want to play that game of terror and bloodshed in India to make the spectators tremble
 burkanashin mahilaayein bharat par barapaayengi 'kahar'pakistan kii sarajameen se hindustan par aatankwaadi hamalaa koi nai baat nahin he, lekin is baar pakistani fouj, vahaan kii khufia agency iesai or aatankwaadi sanghathanon ne jo sajeesh rachi kii he, vaisaa isse pehle kabhi nahin hua
 This is a group of more than a hundred Burkanshi girls and women getting ready in Pakistan, who can go to any extent to implement their intention
 agar pakistan is baar apni is sajeesh main kaamyaab ho jaataa, to hindustan main itane begunaahon kaa khun bahegaa ki uski ginati bhi mushkil ho jaaegi kyonki pakistan main taiyaar ho rahi in mahila fidayinon kaa makasad sirf hamalaa karnaa nahin he, balki har hamalon ko aisi bheedwali jagahon par anjaam dena he, jisase zyada se zyada logon kii jaan jaae
 For this, these girls are being given special training to mingle and hide in the crowd, that is, these fidayeen want to get the most out of being their women and burqaanshin
 ladi brigade ke dimag main bharaa jehad ke naam par 'jehar'majahab ke naam par khun-kharabe sajishein pehle bhi hui hai, lekin pakistan main baithe aatank ke aakaaon ne is baar jis tarah ladakiyon ko mohare ke taur par istemaal karnaa shuru kiya he, wo chaunkaane vaala he
 The attitude of security agencies with women around the world is generally slightly soft compared to men and India is no different

 They are ready to do anything due to the poison of jihad in the name of religion in the minds of these girls
 ab bas intjaar he, to kisi tarah ghuspaith kar is ladi brigade ko hindustan main daakhil karana, taaki dehshatgardi ke is napak iraade ko anjaam tak pahunchaaya ja sake
 This lady brigade is moving towards India, this lady brigade was first given the training of terror, then made aware of Hindustani cities and then fake passports were prepared to send to India
 pakistan kii ladi brigade hindustan kii taraf raftaa-raftaa hi sahi, aage bad rahi he
 In such a situation, the challenge has become even greater for the Indian security agencies
 nishane par honge bharat ke ye shahardilli, mumbai, kolkata, chandigarh, jammu-kashmir
 After learning the subtleties of terror in the ancestry of ISI and Pakistani army, these girls first want to wreak havoc in these cities of India, so that the impact of the attack is maximum
 bharat ko lagi PAK ne napak plan kii bhanakpakistan ke is napak plan ke bare main hindustani khufia agenciyon ko jo khabar mili he, wo kuch aisi hi he-sutron kii maane to in mahila fidayinon ko jin jagahon par hamalaa karne ke nirdesh die gaye hai, unamem train kii mahila bogiyaan, ladakiyon ke skool-college, bheed bhare bazaar or aam chunaav ke din poling booth shaamil hai
 At the same time, according to the convenience, they have been tasked to target other public transport and even some big leaders when given a chance
 jaahir he, ye nakaabposh ladkiyaan zyada se zyada nuksaan pahunchaana chaahati hai or iske liye baqayada in ladakiyon ko hindustan ke nakshe par bade shaharon kii pahchaan karaate hue hamale kii training di gai he
 According to the intelligence agencies, now Pakistan has made full preparations to take this lady brigade to India to carry out these attacks
 iesai kii is root plan main nepal or bangladesh jaise mulkon ke raste in ladakiyon ko hindustan bhijwane kii taiyaari he

 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi kii naagarikta kya he? bhartiya yaa british? ye sawaal ek baar phir bhartiya raajnneeti main charchaa main aa gaya he
 Bharatiya Janata Party leader Subramanian Swamy has been questioning Rahul's citizenship for a long time and now the Home Ministry has asked Rahul Gandhi to answer it
 swami kaa aarope he ki rahul gandhi british hai, to vahiin congress kaa kahana he ki vah janmajaat bhartiya hai
 In such a situation, understand when this dispute has been going on and what is it
 >darasal, 4 saal pehle yani 2015 main subramanyam swami ne pradhanmantri narendra modi ko chitthee likh sabase pehle is sawaal ko khadaa kiya tha
 In this letter written in November 2015, Swamy claimed that Rahul is a British citizen, in such a way, his Indian citizenship and membership of Parliament should be revoked
 is masale ko lekar supreme court main bhi yachika daayar kii gai thi, lekin adaalat ne isaki sibiai jaanch karaane kii maang vaali arji ko khaarij kar diya tha
 > In January 2016, this matter once again came under discussion
 tab bijepi saansad mahesh giri ne loksabhaa spikar ko chitthee likh rahul gandhi kii naagarikta par sthiti spasht karne kii maang kii thi
 After which this issue was moved in front of a committee, where the entire investigation took place and Rahul Gandhi had to answer
 samiti ko die gaye apane jawaab main rahul gandhi ne kaha tha ki ye sirf meri chhavi kharaab karne kii ek koshish he
 He had said that i have never sought or retained British citizenship
 hairat kii baat he ki samiti ne is tarah kii yachika ko sweekaar bhi kiya
 > In September 2017, this issue once again came in the discussion, during which Swamy tweeted and mentioned it
 saath hi unhone grahamantri rajnath singh ko bhi masale par chitthee likh di thi or ab jab chunaav charam par he to grih mantralay ne rahul gandhi se jawaab talab kar liya he
 What is Subramanian Swamy's argument? Actually, Swamy has told the Ministry of Home Affairs that Rahul Gandhi is a director in a company named Backops Limited registered in the United Kingdom since 2003
 saath hi is company main sachiv bhi hai
 The complaint also states that the annual returns filed by the company in 2005 and 2006 stated your (rahul Gandhi) date of birth as 19 / 06 / 1970 and declared his citizenship to be British
 kya kahata he kanoon?bhartiya kanoon ke anusaar, koi bhi naagarik sirf ek hi naagarikta rakh saktaa he
 That is, if he is a citizen of India, then he cannot hold citizenship of any other country
 bharat main dohari naagarikta ko manyata nahin he
 This means that no foreign citizen can also remain a Member of Parliament
 rahul gandhi kii naagarikta par naa sirf swami ne sawaal khadey kiye hai, balki haal hi main jab rahul ne vynad or amethi se apana namakan kiya to bhi vahaan vipakshi ummidavaaron ne rahul kii naagarikta par sawaal kiya tha
 However, the documents were then found to be correct and Rahul's nomination was accepted

 Karan Johar is distributing its Hindi dubbed version
 is film ko do bhaagon main banaaya gaya he or iskaa doosraa bhaag 2016 main relies hoga
 'bahubali' is a period film and at the same time it is being considered as the most expensive film of Indian cinema
 isamen koi shaq nahin he ki yah film bahut hi bhavy he, iske special effects kamaal ke hai or film ek vijual treet he yani aap iskaa filmakan dekhakar hairaan rah jaaenge
 Art direction, music, action, filming are all less appreciated
 soharaab modi kii film 'sikandar' ke baad mujhe kisi film ke yuddh ke drishy pasand aae hai to vah he 'bahubali'
 Technology has given a new dimension to the scenes in this film
 film kii casting bhi ek dam sateek he or sabhi kaa kaam bhi saraahneey he sivaay anoushka shetty ke jinka mechap or abhinay donon hi chhap nahin chhodte
 The comments is film kii duusari khami he, iskaa madhyantar se pehle kaa hissaa, jo kaaphi dhilaa he
 There are two points of view
 pehla yah ki ho saktaa he nirdeshak ne screen play film ke do bhaagon ke najariye se likhvaya ho, jisaki vajah se film ke is bhaag kaa pehla hissaa sirf kirdaaron ko jamaane main hi lag jaataa he or doosraa najariya yah ki nirdeshak ko dakshin ke darshakon ko rijhaane ke liye thodaa heroism bhi rakhana tha, par mere khyaal se vah screen play ko or kas sakate the
 While watching the rest of the film, apart from its grandeur, your attention hardly goes anywhere else
 to main kahuunga ki yah film aapako dekhni chahie, kyonki hindustani cinema kaa itihaas film ek kadam or aage badhaati he

 After Sohrab Modi's film 'sikander', i have liked the battle scenes of a film, so it is 'bahubali'
 takanic ne is film main drishyon ko ek nayaa aayam diya he
 The casting of the film is also accurate and the work of all is praiseworthy except for Anushka Shetty whose makeup and acting both do not leave an impression
 tippaniyan The film's other drawback is its pre-intermission part, which is pretty loose
 ise dekhne ke do nazariye hai
 The first is that the director may have written the screen play from the point of view of the two parts of the film, due to which the first part of this part of the film takes place only to establish the characters and secondly, the director has to give the audience of the south There was also a bit of heroism to be wooed, but i think he could further tighten the screen play
 baaki film dekhte vakt isaki bhavyata ke alaava aapkaa dhyaan shaayad hi kahin or jaae
 So i would say that you should watch this film, because the history of Indian cinema takes the film one step further
 meri taraf se ise 3

 US President Barack Obama has attempted to moderate the severity of his press secretary Robert Gibbs' confrontation with Indian security officials at Hyderabad House in New Delhi, saying he had a "good intent" behind it
 iske saath hi unhone muskuraate hue kaha ki unka pair ab bhi chotil he
 At the time of mentioning this, he was laughing softly
 air force van vimaan main savaar obama ne kaha, ‘iske peeche unki acchhee manshaa thi
 Obama said this during his return to the US at the end of his four-day visit to India, Indonesia, South Korea and Japan
 gat aath november ko hyderabad house main pradhanmantri doctor manmohan singh kii aguwai main bhartiya pratinidhimandal or obama kii aguwai main america pratinidhimandal kii baithak honi thi, jiske pehle samvaad sankalan or photo khinchne ke liye white house ke patrakaron ke pool ko baithak kaksh main pravesh dene ko lekar gibs or bhartiya suraksha adhikariyon ke bich garmagarmee ho gai thi
 Gibbs slammed into the door watching all the members of the pool shut the door without sending it inside
 obama ne hansate hue kaha,‘unka paanv abhi bhi chotil he
 According to the report, Gibbs wanted all eight American cameramans to be allowed inside the chamber and had an argument with Indian security officials about this
 unhone aisa nahin hone dene par baithak se purv hi obama ko vahaan se le jane kii dhamkee bhi di thi
 Some such photographs also appeared in the American media, in which Gibbs was seen engaging with Indian security officials
 obama ne mazaakia andaaj main kaha, ‘main bataanaa chahta hum ki unka pair abhi bhi chotil he
 ' 16 se 20 hajaar feet kii oonchai
 Temperature freezing
 aise main kahin barfili tufaan aa gai to bachane kaa koi rasta hi nahin bachataa
 One such storm took the life of our four soldiers posted in Siachen on November 18
 magar aaj ham jo sach aapako bataane ja rahe hai, wo siachin kaa nahin balki duniya ke sabase oonche, sabase thande or sabase khatarnaak pahaad yani everest kaa he
 The Everest where even today the corpses give way to the wandering humans
 ye duniya kii iklauti jagah he jahaan laashon se milastone banate hai
 What is the secret of the death zone? What is this place where corpses are made milestones? or unhen do gaz zamin bhi mayysar nahin hoti
 Why these dead bodies are made mile stones for humans
 kyon ye saikadon saalon baad bhi kharaab nahin hoti hai
 The answers to all these questions are on this world's highest snowy peak
 ek aisa barfila pahaad jahaan insaan marate to hai
 But their dead bodies never come back from there
 kyonki ye pahaad un laashon ko vahaan se waapas aane hi nahin detaa
 The corpses become 'milestone' land so barren and the pass so high that reaching here can be the aim of life
 magar majaburi nahin
 Because death falls on life here
 ye everest he duniya kaa sabase ooncha, sabase thanda or sabase khatarnaak pahaad
 Every year, about three-and-a-half to three hundred people come here by making a mission to conquer it
 kuch kaamyaab hote hai or kuch naakaamayaab hokar yaheen isi barf main samaa jate hai
 But they do not die even after dying
 ye apni galatiyon se dusron ko sabak dete hai ki jis raste par unhen maut mili
 It is forbidden to visit
 or kabhi kabhi unki laashen yahaan aane vaale parvatarohiyon ke liye google map kaa bhi kaam karti hai
 The corpses show the way more than 308 Mile stones, ie dead bodies are buried on the way of Everest mountain
 jinhen dekhakar yahaan aane vaale parvatarohi apni manzil tay karte hai
 Who are these people? magar usase pehle ye jaananaa zaruri he ki everest par insaan se mile kaa pathar ban chuke ye log aakhir mare kaise
 According to one figure, most of the deaths occurred here due to slips and falls
 or uske baad thand kii vajah se dimag sunn ho jane par logon kii saanse tham gayi
 For 98 years, 'milestone' corpses have not even tried to take these corpses to their loved ones
 kyonki yahaan is barfili chotii se laashon ko neeche zamin par laana naa sirf naammumkin sa he
 It is also more expensive than anticipated
 lihaaza everest kii intazaamia cameti in laashon ko yaheen chhod detii he
 According to an estimate, if one of the 308 corpses lying on Everest can also be removed
 to naa sirf 30 lakh rupayon kaa kharch aayega balki use utaarne ke liye jo log in barfili chotiyon par chadhenge unki jaan jane kaa bhi khatra hoga
 This is the temperature of 16 ° c to 40 ° c when descending from the snowy hill, where we and you cannot even decide to go
 vahaan ye parvatarohi in khadi pahadiyon par chadhane kii zid karte hai
 Which is almost equivalent to committing suicide
 kuch ek had tak jaakar laut aate hai
 So some put their lives at risk of going ahead
 or ye 308 laashen unheen logon kii hai
 Who insisted on fighting the wrath of nature
 marane waalon main kai to aise hai jinhone everest kii chotii ko fatah to kar liya
 But he died while descending from this snowy hill
 green boot ke naam se jaani jaati he laasheneverest kii is pahari par do taraf se chadhaai kii jaati he
 And the dead bodies of climbers have been lying at different distances on both these sides for years
 in laashon ke koi naam nahin he
 Their clothes and shoes have become a symbol of the way
 ye laash green boot ke naam se jaani jaati he
 Which is on the northeast path of Everest
 jo bhartiya parvatarohi shevang paljor kii he
 In 1996, while climbing Everest, he was trapped in an icy storm
 aaj tak shevang kii laash vahiin padi he or green boot ke naam se jaani jaati he
 Like Shevang, many more corpses are on these paths
 jinhen naam se nahin balki unke kapadon yaa juuton se pahachaanaa jaataa he
 The results of Chhindwara Lok Sabha seat of Madhya Pradesh have been declared

 The Mumbai Traffic Police uploaded a video film to youtube in late April titled 'guilt' (crime)
 
 
 yah video ek vyakti ke afsos kaa ehsaas hone kii kahani he
 
 
 The video begins with a house where a young man has died, and his funeral is about to begin
 
 
 uski vidhwaa patni zaar-zaar ro rahi he, or aasapaas ke sabhi logon kii ankhen bhi puri tarah nam hai
 
 
 Just then, another man, who is the boss of a dead young man, looks very depressed
 
 
 iske baad bos ko ek cheharaa nazar aata he, jise dekhakar vah kaaphi ghabara jaataa he, or kahani flashbek main chali jaati he
 
 
 Now in a flashback, the boss is celebrating his birthday among the people he works with, where alcohol is also being drunk
 
 
 daavat main aae apane ek junior ko sharaab pine ke liye uksaate hue bos bahut khush nazar aa rahaa he
 
 
 Just then, the video then reaches the house of the person who died
 
 
 bos vahaan ek kone main dubkkar rone lagata he, or baahar nikal jaataa he
 
 
 But once he gets out, he sees the same face again, standing near his car
 
 
 darasal yah cheharaa usee ladke kaa he, jisaki shavyatra main shaamil hone bos pahunchaa he
 
 
 That is, he is a ghost
 
 
 yah bhoot apane bos ko bahut gusse main ghur-ghurkar dekh rahaa he, or bos ko phir daavat kii baaten yaad aati hai
 
 
 Then it appears, blood flows from the ghost's temple, and the boss sits on his knees on the road and apologizes
 
 
 use ehsaas ho rahaa he ki apni daavat main sharaab pilaane ke baad us saathi ko gaadi chalaakar ghar jane dene kii vajah se uski maut ke liye vahi zimmedaar he, or yahi vah 'gilt' he, jise mumbai trephic police mahasoos karwaanaa chaahati he

 After this, the boss sees a face, which makes him very nervous, and the story goes into a flashback
 
 
 ab flashbek main bos apane janmdin kaa jashn apane saath kaam karne vaale logon ke bich manaa rahaa he, jahaan sharaab bhi pi ja rahi he
 
 
 The boss seems happy when he provokes one of his juniors to drink

 The boss starts crying in a corner, and walks out
 
 
 lekin baahar nikalate hi use vahi cheharaa phir nazar aata he, apni car ke paas khadi hua
 
 
 Actually this face is of the same boy, whose boss has reached to join the funeral
 
 
 yani, vah bhoot he
 
 
 This ghost is staring at his boss angrily, and the boss then remembers the feast
 
 
 phir dikhaai detaa he, bhoot kii canapati se bahata khun, or bos sadak par ghutanon ke bal baithkar maafee maangata rah jaataa he
 
 
 He realizes that he is responsible for his death due to letting that fellow drive home after drinking alcohol at his party, and this is the 'gilt' that the Mumbai Traffic Police wants to feel
 
 
 video ke ant main mumbai trephic police ne yahi sandesh bhi diya he
 
 
 'be responsible friends, arrange cab after party'

 Think Hindustan! Like Tuesday, Wednesday's 'halla Bol' too was the focus on Tej Bahadur being given bad food
 jawan ke gopneey khat se khulaase hue hai ki roti kii rakam par kis tarah afasar aish kar rahe hai
 Come, know today's 5 big words
 
 
 1
 Sambit Patra, spokesperson BJP said that this is a very sensitive matter
 ham sena ko sailyut karte hai
 If a young person does not get the right food, then it is a matter of concern
 ye officer or jawan kaa maamla he
 i am a political person
 meri tippanee is maamle main sahi nahin hai
 It is wrong to call BSF a dictator
 meraa kahana he ki is par raajnneeti band ho
 If food is not available, then all of us bowed down in shame
 2
 Ajay Kumar, Spokesperson Congress says that we had lost the election in 2014
 hamaara to kuch banataa nahin
 Ask the questions of the BJP
 inhen mat jane dijiega pataligali se
 The way the investigation is being done in the name of investigation with Tej Bahadur is not right

 If this had happened somewhere, it would be the result of wrong leadership or wrong management

 17 percent voting was recorded
 is seat par rashtriya loktantric party ke sanyojak hanuman beniwal bijepi kaa samarthan lekar congress kii jyoti mirdha ko takkar de rahe hai
 Now the results of the election will be announced on 23 May
 bijepi ne ralopa ke saath gathbandhan kar yah seat unke liye chhod di he
 Jyoti Mirdha is the granddaughter of former Union Minister Nathuram Mirdha
 is seat par is baar kul 13 candidet maidan main hai
 From here, candidates of National Democratic Party, National Power Party are in the fray
 is seat se 10 nirdaleey pratyaashee maidan main hai
 Political Background: The politics of Marwar in Rajasthan has been dominated by the Mirdha family since before independence
 sabase baldevaraam mirdha ne kisaanon ke hiton kii raksha ke liye marwar kisaan sabha sthapana kii
 But the country's first Prime Minister Pt
 jawaharlal nehru se madhyastata ke baad kisaan sabha kaa congress main vilay ho gaya
 After this, Ramdevas Mirdha, son of Baldev Ram Mirdha and Nathuram Mirdha of his own family, dominated the politics here for almost six decades
 lekin dhire-dhire mirdha parivaar kaa asar kam hone laga
 So now the new generation is seen struggling to save this political legacy
 pichley kuch samay se do pramukh dal congress or bijepi ke bich ek nae khilaadi ke taur par hanuman beniwal ubhare hai jo jat yuvaaon ko saath lekar is donon dalon se alag lakeer khichna chaahate hai
 After independence, Congress won the maximum number of 16 general elections and 2 by-elections in Nagaur Lok Sabha seat from 1952 to 2014, 11 times
 1952 main nirdaleey ummidavaar jidi somani jite
 Mathura Das of Congress in 1957, NK Somani of Congress in 1960 by-election and Surendra Kumar Dey of Congress in 1962 were elected from here
 lekin 1967 main congress ke enke somani swatantri party ke tikat par chunaav jeet
 After this, the Mirdha family continued to hold this seat from 1971 to 1997
 1971 main nathuram mirdha yahaan ke saansad chune gaye
 So at the Janata wave of 1977, Nathuram Mirdha managed to save this seat
 1980 main nathuram mirdha congress (you) ke tikat par yahaan ke saansad bane
 An interesting contest was witnessed in this seat in 1984 when Ramdivas Mirdha and Nathuram Mirdha, two strong leaders of the Mirdha family, pitted against each other
 is chunaav main congress ke tikat par ramanivas mirdha ne bhartiya lokdal se ummidavaar nathuram mirdha ko shikast di
 But in the 1989 election, Nathuram Mirdha defeated Ram Niwas Mirdha while contesting from the Janata Dal
 iske 1991 or 1996 ke loksabhaa chunaav main kagress ke tikat par nathuram mirdha kaa is seat par kabja rahaa
 But after the death of Nathuram Mirdha, his son Bhanuprakash Mirdha won the seat on the BJP ticket in 1997 bypoll defeating Ram Niwas Mirdha of Congress
 yah pehla mauka tha jab bijepi ne is seat par jeet kaa swaad chakhaa, lekin party ko sahaara mirdha parivaar kaa hi lenaa padaa
 So far, Ram Raghunath Chaudhary entered Nagaur politics revolving around the Mirdha family
 mana jaataa he ki mirdha parivaar kii aapasi foot kii vajah se ramaraghunatha choudhary yahaan kii siyasat main apni jagah banane main kaamyaab rahen
 In 1998 and 1999, Ram Raghunath Chaudhary was elected MP for two consecutive terms on Congress ticket
 lekin choudhary saal 2004 main bijepi ke bhavar singh dangavas se chunaav haar gaye
 After this, in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, Jyoti Mirdha, granddaughter of Congress ticket Nathuram Mirdha, was elected as an MP from here
 lekin 2014 kii modi lahar main jyoti mirdha yah seat bachaane main naakaamayaab raheen or bijepi ke siaar choudhary nagaur ke saansad chune gaye
 2014 mandate: 59 in Nagaur parliamentary seat in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections

 the creature between the donkey and the horse, in which the horse's specialty is also found
 ye bahut satark hote hai or jaraa si aahat hone par hi dur chale jate hai
 It is said that this species of Indian wild ace (equus hemionus khur) is found only in Dasada, Gujarat
 is kshetra ko 'kuccha ke chote ran' ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 These safaris can be seen filling the kulancha through a safari at Wildlife Sanctuary, just 10 km from Dasada
 yahaan pai jane vaali choti ghaas hi in ghudkhron kii prakritik khuraaq hoti he
 Due to the danger of extinction, the total number of conservationists here is close to 4800
 ye kuccha ke chote ran ke 5000 varg kilometre ilaake main hi simate hue hai
 They are 210 cm in length and 100 to 125 cm in height
 inkaa vajan 200 se 250 kilogram ke kareeb hota he
 They can run at a speed of 70 kilometers per hour
 ye aam gadhon se kahin zyada furtile hote hai
 To save them from extinction, this area has been given the status of a sanctuary
 ye kshetra mote taur par kuccha or surendranagar jilon ke tahat hi aata he

 Apart from this, some youth are also earning a livelihood as a guide
 pehle yahaan log sirf krishi par hi nirbhar rahete the
 They also had to migrate to big cities to find work in adverse conditions
 'wild es sancturi' ko chunavi raajnneeti main naa ghasiten'kshetra ke log akhilesh ke bayaan ko sahi nahin maanate
 He says that the wild ace should not have been dragged into electoral politics
 inkaa kahana he ki yahaan tourist aate hai to hamaara rojgaar chalata he
 The youth here also invited Akhilesh to visit Wild Ace Century after the UP elections to see the reality with his own eyes
 desh or vishwa kii heritage ke taur par jane vaale ghudkhron par raajnneetik bayaanbaji se vanyajeev premi bhi khafa hai

 har koi chahta he ki uske bal lambey, ghaney or mulaayam hon
 Especially girls always want beautiful hair
 jitani dekhbhaal wo apni twachaa kii karti hai utana hi khyaal wo apane baalo kaa rakhti hai
 You also did not have any new hair product in the market that would have bought it
 baalo par wo product applai karne ke dauraan aapke dimag main bas ek hi baat chalati hogi ki ab to aapke bal khubasurat ho hi jaaenge
 But according to experts, every product sold in the market should benefit your hair, it is not necessary
 bazaar main bikne vaale zyaadaatar utpaada rasaynic hote hai jisase baalo kii natural khubsuurati jane kaa dar bana rahata he
 Despite all the products and experiments, if your hair is dry and lifeless, then your habits will be responsible for it
 kai baar aisa hota he ki jin aadaton ko ham acha samajhakar karte hai wo aadaten hi hamaare liye khatarnaak sabit hoti hai
 These are some habits that we do, considering them to be good, but they prove to be harmful: 1
 suraj kii roshni se bachanajab bhi aap ghar se baahar nikalen baalo dhakkar nikalen
 Generally, you must have heard people saying that it is wrong to not let the sunlight fall on the balls
 baalo kii khubsuurati ke liye unhen vitamin di kaa poshan milanaa jaruri he lekin suraj kii roshni main bahut der tak rahanaa khatarnaak he
 2
 baalo ko hameshaa baandhakar rakhansiogar aapke bal khubasurat hai to inhen khulaa rakhane main hi bhalaai he
 Keeping hair tied all the time causes more hair breakage
 saath hi baalo kii quality par bhi asar padataa he
 3
 har roj bal dhonahar roj shampoo se bal dhonaa khatarnaak ho saktaa he
 Similarly, it is also not right to use a conditioner every day after shampooing
 agar aapke scalp oili he to bhi hafte main do yaa teen se adhik baar bal nahin dhoen
 When the hair is completely dry then only comb them
 4
 Use of hot rods on hair, excessive use of hot rods causes hair to deteriorate quickly
 stretner, dryer or curls kaa bahut adhik istemaal karnaa nuksaandeh ho saktaa he
 This ends the natural moisturization of hair and turns hair dry and lifeless
 5
 Open hair even in pollution, if you are going to some place where there is a lot of pollution then try to get your hair tied
 taaki baalo ko kam se kam nuksaan ho

 When i told my father that i could not connect my identity with the body of the boy
 unhen laga ki mere bete ko cricket, basket ball vagairah khelnaa chahie taaki introwart hokar aisa na soche
 But i did not like cricket
 mujhe kitaaben padhanaa, kichan main kaam karnaa mujhe pasand tha
 i told him that i am not comfortable, so he said that if a boy is born, then he has to be a boy, so i said that i should leave the house
 pita ne kaha ki jaao darwaja khulaa he
 The system is bad, 98 percent of the transgenders left in childhood, whose house was it, today if you want to correct, whom will Simran or parents correct? On this question, she says that i will correct the system
 isi system main mata pita aate hai
 No parent is outside the system, they are also inside the system
 ye system hi he ki 98 transgender bachche yaa to ghar se baahar phenk die jate hai yaa bhaag jate hai
 It is not the parents but the system's fault
 aaj jahaan hum, bahut khush hunvo kahati hai ki aaj jahaan hum vahaan jindagi kaa har lamhaa ji rahi hum

 In the first joint rally of the SP-BSP and RLD alliance in Deoband, West Uttar Pradesh, BSP President Mayawati attacked the Congress Minimum Income Scheme (justice), saying that like Narendra Modi's promise of giving 15-20 lakhs to the poor people Congress President Rahul Gandhi's promise to give 72 thousand is also a jumla
 virdohi partiyon ke hawa-hawaii chunavi vaadon ke bahekaave main nahin aana he
 However, Mayawati has stated her formula to alleviate poverty
 mayawati ne kaha ki pichley chunaav main bijepi ne desh kii janata ko achche din dikhaane ke jo pralobhan bhare vaade kiye the, congress sarkaar kii tarah hi khokhale sabit hue hai
 Modi's development has been reduced to 15-20 lakhs for the poor and the development of all along
 ab congress bhi aise vaade kar rahi he
 The BSP president said that the Congress chief has said to give Rs 6 thousand every month to woo the votes of the very poor people of the country, there is no permanent solution to poverty
 agar centre main hamen sarkaar banane kaa mauka miltaa he to har maheene sarkari va gaiyr-sarkari kshetron main sthaayee rojgaar dene kii vyavastha karegi
 Targeting Indira Gandhi's poverty reduction, Mayawati said that Congress should not come under this pretext
 congress adhyaksh kii daadi indira gandhi ne bhi garibi hataane ke liye 20 sutreey kaarykram kii ghoshnaa kar garibon se chhalaava karne kaa kaam kiya tha
 But even today people are struggling with poverty
 mayawati ne kaha ki har paanch saal main satta parivartan hota he
 If we get a chance to form a government at the Center, i will make permanent arrangements to remove extreme backwardness
 unhone kaha ki sarkari or gaiyr sarkari naukariyon ke jariye har haath ko kaam dekar garibi kii samasya ko dur karenge
 Explain that the Congress has promised in its manifesto that it will implement the Minimum Income Scheme (justice) when it comes to power
 iske tahat desh ke 5 karod parivaar yaa 25 karod logon ko salanaa 72 hajaar rupee dene kaa vaada kiya gaya
 Through this scheme, 20 percent of the people of the country will get benefits

 However, his plane fell in Pakistan and he remained in custody for about three days

 rashtriya chambal ghadiphal abhayaarany kshetra main ho rahe ret ke avaidh khanan ko lekar hycourt se kadi fatkaar lagane ke baad rajya sarkaar or muraina prashasan sakriy ho gaya he
 The administration has begun the process of revoking gun licenses for those involved in illegal sand mining
 madhya pradesh sarkaar ne abhayaarany ko jodgaye vaale rashtriya rajmarg-3 par pradesh sashastr police bal (eseef) kii 26veen batalian kii ek company ko bhi beete 21 disambar ko tainaat kar di he
 Illegal mining sand is being used on such a large scale that the Forest Department has to issue advisory that government departments related to construction should use only legitimate mining sand
 beeti 3 janvari ko hycourt kii gwalior khandpeeth ne rajya sarkaar ko abhayaarany kshetra main eseef kii tainaati ke nirdesh die the taaki ret mafia ko roka ja sake
 But within a month of the deployment of soldiers, there have been two major incidents of encounter with illegal mining mafias in the sanctuary area
 8 janvari ko avaidh khanan kar ret le ja rahe teen tractaron ko van vibhaag ke amale or eseef javaanon ne jabt kiya tha lekin avaidh khanan main lipt logon ne amale par patharav kar diya or tractor lekar bhaag nikle
 The second incident is on 14 January, when the SAF managed to escape by firing sand mafia sand on the soldiers
 pichley ek maah main khanan mafia van vibhaag ke udandaste par bhi chaar baar jaanaleva hamale kar chuke hai
 The Mineral Department has never issued a license for mining in the Chambal river, but sand mining has been happening here for a long time
 khanan ke kaaran chambal abhayaarany ke jaleey jeevon, ghadiphal, dolphin or parindon kii basaahat ko nuksaan pahunch rahaa he
 Advocate Rajiv Sharma, who has filed a petition in the High Court seeking a ban on illegal mining, says, "the quality of the water here remains due to the aquatic fauna of the sanctuary area
" avaidh khanan jari rahaa to in jeevon kaa astitv to khatre main padegaa hi, isse inasaanon ko bhi nuksaan pahonchega
 Illegal mining has been controlled to some extent since the deployment of SAF personnel
 pehle yahaan har din 500 trali ret nikaali ja rahi thi
 "it is not easy for the state government and local administration to completely ban illegal mining, despite all the stringent measures
" darasal chambal abhayaarany madhya pradesh kii seemaa main 435 varg kimi main failaa he
 About 170 villages are inhabited on its banks
 itane bade kshetra kii rakhwali ke liye van vibhaag ke paas 52 suraksha guard or adhikari hi hai
 According to an official of the forest department, "sand mafias have taken out routes from between these villages to reach the river bank
 ye log inhen raaston se tractor-traaliyon ke jariye ret le jate hai
 Despite the deployment of jawans, there are half a dozen villages around the Chambal Sanctuary where sand from illegal mining is deposited
 raat ke vakt ise baahar bhej diya jaataa he
 "most mining takes place around the Rajghat bridge
 ret se bhare tractaron ko rajmarg-3 se guzarana hi padataa he
 Therefore, SAF personnel have been deployed at the Eco Center in Deori along this route
 avaidh ret se bhari gadibhan jaise hi mukhya rajmarg-3 par aati hai, inhen police yaa van vibhaag ke adhikari rokane kii koshish karte hai
 In this case, the mining mafia attack the administrative staff
 ret khanan kaa yah avaidh kaarobaar chambal ilaake sangathit aparaadh kaa rup le chukaa he
 In many cases, the police have also been accused of meeting mafia
 yahi vajah he ki avaidh khanan rokane ke liye tainaat sashastr bal main sthaneey, yani muraina or gwalior ke javaanon ko tainaat nahin kiya gaya he, taaki pakshpaat se bachaa ja sake
 Following a court order, a task force has been constituted to stop mining, which is headed by District Forest Officer (DFO) Vicente Rahim of Morena
 task force main van vibhaag ke alaava police, rajasav or khanij vibhaag ke adhikari bhi shaamil hai
 Vicente says that government officials have also been appealed not to use the sand of the Chambal River
 ve kehete hai, ''sthaneey nikaay apane nirmaan kaaryon main jo theke de rahe hai usamen thekedaar avaidh utkhanan vaali ret istemaal kar saktaa he
 For this, it has been asked to put the condition in the tender itself that they use the sand of Sindh or Banas river
 iske alaava vaid khanan vaali ret kii roylty raseed va transit paas bhi dekha ja saktaa he
 This will curb the use of Chambal sand
 '' diefo rahim ke mutabik sashastr police ke tainaat hone se khaas taur se rajghat pul ke paas nigaraanee badi he or din main to avaidh khanan puri tarah band ho gaya he
 It is feared that illegal mining may occur in some areas at night

 varsh 2002 ke gujarat dange ko lekar 12 saal purv rajg se alag hone vaale lojpa supremeo ramvilas paswan ne kaha ki endie main shaamil hokar unhone koi galati nahin kii kyonki congress or argedy ke saath gathbandhan ko lekar anischitata ke bich unhen jis tarah se apamaanit or kinare kar diya
 After this, he had to take this decision keeping in mind the interests of his party
 patna main patrakaron se baatcheet karte hue paswan ne kaha ki unhone vyaktigat adarsh bhaavana main bahakar dharmanirpekshata or puraane gathbandhan (argedy or lojpa kaa) ke naam par congress or argedy ke saath samjhaute ke liye samay ko barbaad kiya jabaki lojpa sansadeey board kaa kahana tha ki unhen bina samay ganvaaye upie yaa endie main jane ko lekar nirnay le lenaa chahie
 He said that he had realized that in the same way, dragging the coalition case till the announcement of elections would take these two parties and in the end offered to give two to three seats to LJP and ask him to contest those seats
 Otherwise, make your way out
 paswan ne kaha ki endie main unki party ke jane kaa sabase bada kaaran unke dwaara apamaanit or kinare kar diya janaa tha or log samajhane lage the ki lojpa kaa koi apana aastitiv hi nahin he tathaa kaaryakartaaon ko jagah-jagah apamaanit hona pad rahaa tha
 He said that due to uncertainty about alliance with Congress and RJD, he had to take a decision to go to NDA due to the rebellion of LJP leaders and activists
 yah puche jane par ki kaise ve apane matadaataaon ko samajhaayenge paswan ne kaha ki unka matadaata unase aage he or unki maang thi ki hamen endie ke saath jane kaa nirnay lenaa chahie balki endie main ab jane ke baad matadaataaon kaa kahana he ki ye nirnay unhone pehle kyon nahin liya
 Paswan said that he has joined the NDA now, but despite the announcement of Lok Sabha elections, till date the decision on alliance between Congress and RJD has not been made, in such a situation we do not live anywhere
 unhone kaha, ‘hamako is str par laayaa gaya or unhen yahaan tak dhakela gaya ki unke paas koi chaara nahin bachaa tha
 Our party has its own ideology and it is a fight over the existence of their party
 ’ yah puche jane par kya unka dil abhi bhi dharmanirpekshata ke liye dhadkta he or majaburi main idhar aae hai, paswan ne kaha ki dharmanirpekshata to unka mishan or uske liye ve abhi bhi sankalpit he tathaa uske liye hameshaa unka dil dhadkta rahegaa
 Asked if there was a compulsion of compulsion with the NDA, Paswan denied that he felt the alliance should have taken place earlier and as far as the ideology in question has not merged with his party BJP
 unhone kaha ki gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi par bhale hi aarope lagata hon par pichley ek varsh ke dauraan unke kisi bhi bhaashan main jaraa bhi sampradayikta nahin dikhaai di he
 Paswan said that one of the issues is to bring development and all sections of society together because India is like a garden in which people of all religions and communities are there and the gardener's garden is good where every kind of flower blooms
 He has also said more to Narendra Modi
 paswan ne kaha ki ve bhale hi 12 saal baad endie main laute hai lekin desh kii janata ne yah man bana liya he ki is baar centre main satta kaa parivartan karnaa he or unhen lagata he ki is baar centre main endie kii sarkaar banegi
 He said that LJP is contesting Lok Sabha elections in seven seats in Bihar in coordination with other constituents of NDA, of which Jamui, Munger, Hajipur, Samastipur, Nalanda, Vaishali and Khagaria

 Saying this, he narrated an anecdote from a school in Rae Bareli when he asked a child how much he knew to read
 akhilesh bataate hai ki 'wo baccha thik se pard nahin paa rahaa tha kyonki shikshak ne use sab kuch ratwa rakhaa tha
 What he remembered by rote, he was just studying
 maine panna palat diya wo nahin pard paaya
 i asked a lot of things, answered some, could not answer some

 He pointed to Mayawati in a funny tone and said that people of stone government are coming on TV a lot these days, but think if the stone hits the TV then what will happen to the TV? aisa kehete hue unhone raibareli ke ek skool kaa kissa sunaaya jab vahaan unhone ek bachche se poocha ki wo kitna padhanaa jaanata he
 Akhilesh explains that 'that child was not able to read properly because the teacher had kept everything to him
 jo ratakar yaad tha, wo bas vahi pard rahaa tha
 i turned the page and could not read it
 maine bahut sari chizein poochi, kuch kaa jawaab diya kuch kaa nahin de paaya
 'akhilesh further explains' Then i asked him that you recognize me, tell me who i am? On this the child said - Yes i recognize you, you are Rahul Gandhi

 mana ja rahaa he ki sachin tendulkar ko bharat ratna mil sake, isliye grih mantralay ne niyamon main badlaav kii sifarish kii he, lekin bijepi ne hockey khilaadi dhyanchandra ko bharat ratna dene kaa mudda uthaa diya he
 It was decided that Bharat Ratna should also be given to the players
 It has not been even a few days that politics has started coloring
 sachin ko bharat ratna dene kii maang par bane dabaav ke chalate grih mantralay ne niyamon main badlaav kiya, par bijepi ke netaa shivaraj singh chouhan ne shigupha choda he ki khilaadiyon ko bharat ratna dena he to sabase pehle hockey ke jaadugar babu dhyanchandra ko diya jaae
 When Chauhan Saheb spoke, even the small big leaders of BJP started shouting
 bijepi ne jor lagaaya, to congress ke netaa or jhaansi se saansad kendriya gramin rajyamantri pradeep jain aditya ne bhi dhyanchandra ke liye bharat ratna kii maang uthaa di
 The great hockey player Ashok Kumar, the son of Dada Dhyan Chandra, has appealed that the people of the country come forward and give this honor to Dada
 netaaon or parivaar waalon baat chalaayi, to hockey khiladi kahaan peeche rahane vaale the
 He also raised the voice for Babu Dhyanchandra
 sirf hockey hi nahin, kapildev jaise cricket khilaadi bhi dhyanchandra ke samarthan main khadey dikh rahe hai
 Though the change on the demand for the award of Bharat Ratna to Sachin has not been fully approved yet, this new demand has certainly put the government in a religious dilemma
 madhyapradesh main badvani ke jangarava gaanv main guruuvar ko 58 saal ke ek shaks kii maut ho gai
 The case relates to rehabilitation in the Narmada Valley, with family members alleging that Laxman Gopal died of shock due to intimidation during the evacuation of officers' homes
 guruuvar dopaher esadm abhayasingh ohariya, tehseeldaar police kii upasthiti main gharon ko khaali karvaa rahe the, isi dauraan shriram ganpat ke ghar ko khaali karwaane ke dauraan parivaar ke sadasyon se jab wo baat kar rahe the, us vakt parivaar ke ek sadsy lakshmana gopal bahut dar gaye or sadame main unki maut ho gai
 The villagers allege that the government is only removing the affected people from their villages by threatening them
 unke punarvaas kii koi baat nahin kar rahi he
 Neither rehabilitation benefits are being provided nor any assurance is being given about this
 narmada kaa jalastr lagaataar badhane main baad prashasan bhi dub kshetra main aa rahe logon ko hataane main laga hua he
 On Thursday also, the administrative team reached the village Jangarwa and started removing people coming from the submergence
 tabhi ghar se saamaan le ja rahi team ko roak rahe lakshmana kii heart atake se maut ho gai
 After this, his family started an uproar by placing the body on the road
 narmada bachaao andolan kaa aarope he ki yah saadhaaran maut nahi he, is maut ke baad adhikariyon ke khilaaf hatya kaa maamla darj kiya janaa chahie
 At the same time, after the death of Laxman, amidst the uproar, SDM Abhay Singh Ohriya started to run through the fields when a crowd broke out
 esadm ke bhaagane par gussaye gaanvvaalon ne unka peechha kiya, aise main pulisavaalon ne suraksha gheraa banaakar adhikariyon ko gaanv se baahar nikaala
 Nowadays, the media is under question
 pichley kuch dinon se media kii karypranali or rukh par sawaal uthne shuru ho gaye hai
 The question is, is the media changing? Are such questions justified on the moral side of the media? aam logon se zyada rajaneta media se khafa nazar aa rahe hai
 The Delhi government also issued a circular, through which the government had instructed all its officials that action would be taken against them if they received any news which damaged the reputation of the Chief Minister or the government
 dilli sarkaar ke is circular main warren hestings kaa bhoot nazar aa rahaa he
 Before independence, anyone who wrote against the British had to go to jail
 'da bengal gajet' ke sampadak james augustus ko us vakt ke governor general warren hestings kii patni kii aalochana karne ke kaaran chaar maheene jail kii sajaa kaatane ke saath-saath paanch sau rupee jurmaana dena padaa tha
 Although the Supreme Court has banned the Kejriwal government's circular, but it is not understood why the Delhi government is so upset with the media? It is the responsibility of the media that along with exposing the problems of the country and the people, also keep an eye on the functioning of the government
 sarkaar ko aalochana kaa saamana karnaa hi padataa he, aalochana se sarkaar ke kaamkaaj main sudhaar hota he
 This is not the first time that Kejriwal is surrounding the media
 isse pehle bhi kai baar kejariwal media par sawaal uthaa chuke hai
 This circular raised by the Kejriwal government raises many questions
 kya arvind kejariwal media ko apane tareeke se chalaanaa chaahate hai? kya kejariwal badal gaye hai yaa kejariwal ko koi galat salaah de rahaa he? man main sabase ahm prashn uthta he ki kejariwal jaise netaa aise faisle kaise le sakate hai? vah media ko behatar tareeke se samajhate hai
 He had taken forward his RTI campaign through the media
 shuruaati daur main kejariwal ne kai channelon or patrikaon ke jariye apni is muhim ko anjaam tak pahunchaaya
 If anyone has benefited the most through the media, then it is Arvind Kejriwal and his party
 pichley kuch saal se media ne aam aadmi party or iske netaaon ke bare main kaaphi kuch dikhaaya
 Ignoring other problems within the country, the media continuously gave coverage to Kejriwal's dharna along with Anna Hazare at Jantar Mantar
 yahaan par kejariwal nahin, media par bhi sawaal uthta he
 In the case of trps, the media forgets its social responsibilities
 aisa lagata he ki media vyakti-kendrit ho gaya he
 At that time, Kejriwal was a hero in every channel and newspaper
 is puure andolan ke dauraan media ne sarkaar kii kaaphi aalochana bhi kii thi
 During that time, if the media had not made Arvind Kejriwal a hero and the government a villain, then today there would not have been a Kejriwal government in Delhi
 arvind kejariwal yah bhi kah chuke hai ki media, modi or bhartiya janata party kaa prachaar karata rahata he
 In the last one year, the Narendra Modi government has also been dragged at the Center
 agar ham vyakti ke rup main narendra modi kii baat karen, to varsh 2002 ke gujarat dangon ke baad agar media ne kisi par sabase zyada sawaal uthaae or sabase zyada kisi kii aalochana kii to vah narendra modi hi hai
 The media gave a lot of space to the corruption and inflation of the Congress
 main media kaa bachaav nahin kar rahaa hum
 There is no doubt that there is a lot of change in the way the media works and the character
 media par uthe sawaalon main kahin na kahin sachai bhi he
 Sometimes it seems that the media is misusing its power
 'ped news' kii baat bhi uthaai ja rahi he
 It is also a question that is there corruption in the media as well? There is also a question about media coverage
 sawaal yah bhi uthta he ki kya media apni saamaajik jimmedaari se bhaag rahaa he? Social news is less visible nowadays in media
 saanp, bichchhu, bhoot-pret ke jariye darshakon ko lubhaane kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 The leaders who have been questioning the media, nowadays their news is shown more by the media
 media kii pahunch kaa vistaar zarur hua he, lekin media gaanvon ke logon kii samasyaon se achoota najar aa rahaa he
 Whatever it is, it is probably not okay to weigh everyone in the same scales
 bahut-se aise samachar channel or akhbaar hai, jo apni eemaandaar reporting or vishleshanon se media kii chhavi acchhee banaae rakhane kii koshish karte hue samaaj ke vyapak hit ke liye kaam karte hai
 The comments aisa nahin he ki media koi acha kaam nahin karata
 The media has raised major scams in the country, many such news channels and newspapers are conscious of the problems of the society and they have also started some special campaigns
 ho saktaa he zyada na ho, lekin pichley kuch dinon main media ne kisaanon kii samasyaon ko bhi dikhaaya he
 In cases like the Nirbhaya incident, we saw the media in a new way
 uski sakriyata or mukharata kii vajah se hi nirbhaya cond par upja naagarik aakrosh jan-andolan kaa rup le sakaa or aakhirkaar yonhinsa virdohi kanoonon main sanshodhan hue
 There is also a flurry between the government and the media, but curbing the freedom of media is not a good thing
 khabar dikhaane ke liye media ko puri azaadi milani chahie
 The government or politicians have to understand the reality
 sirf apane phaayde ke liye media kaa istemaal karnaa or zarurat padane par media ke haq par hathaudaa maarna apane pairon par hi kulhadi maarane jaisaa hoga
 Politicians are more upset with the media than ordinary people
 dilli sarkaar ne ek circular bhi jari kiya, jiske jariye sarkaar ne apane sabhi adhikariyon ko nirdesh diya tha ki yadi ve koi aisi khabar pate hai, jisase mukhyamantri yaa sarkaar kii pratishtha ko nuksaan pahunchataa he, to uske khilaaf karrwai kii jaaegi
 The ghost of Warren Hastings is seen in this circular of the Delhi Government
 azaadi ke pehle angrezon ke khilaaf jo bhi likhata tha, use jail janaa padataa tha
 James Augustus, editor of 'the Bengal Gazette', was sentenced to four months in jail, as well as a fine of five hundred rupees, for criticizing the wife of the then Governor General Warren Hastings
 haalanki supreme court ne kejariwal sarkaar ke circular par roak laga di he, lekin yah samaj nahin aa rahaa he ki dilli sarkaar media se itani khafa kyon he? media kii jimmedaari he ki desh or logon kii samasyaon ko saamne laane ke saath-saath sarkaar ke kaamkaaj par bhi najar rakhe
 The government has to face criticism, criticism improves the functioning of the government
 yah pehali baar nahin ki kejariwal media ko gher rahe hai
 In the past too, Kejriwal has questioned the media many times
 kejariwal sarkaar dwaara nikaala gaya yah circular kai sawaal khadey karata he
 Does Arvind Kejriwal want to run the media in his own way? Has Kejriwal changed or is he giving any wrong advice to Kejriwal? The most important question that arises in mind is how can a leader like Kejriwal take such decisions? He understands the media better
 unhone media ke jariye apni artiai muhim ko aage badhaayaa tha
 In the initial phase, Kejriwal reached this campaign through many channels and magazines
 agar media ke jariye sabase zyada phayda kisi ko hua, to vah arvind kejariwal or unki party ko hua he
 For the past few years, the media has shown a lot about the Aam Aadmi Party and its leaders
 desh ke andar duusari samasyaon ko nazarandaaz karte hue media ne jantar-mantar par anna hajaare ke saath kejariwal ke dharne ko lagaataar kawarej diya
 Here, not only Kejriwal, the media is also questioned
 tiarapy ke chakkar main media apni saamaajik zimmedaariyaan bhul jaataa he
 Media seems to have become person-centered
 us vakt kejariwal har channel or akhbaar main ek nayak ke rup main chhaae hue the
 The government was also critical of the media during this entire movement
 us dauraan agar media ne arvind kejariwal ko nayak or sarkaar ko khalanaayak nahin banaaya hota, to aaj dilli main kejariwal kii sarkaar nahin hoti
 Arvind Kejriwal has also said that the media continues to promote Modi and the Bharatiya Janata Party
 pichley ek saal main centre main narendra modi sarkaar kii bhi kaaphi khinchaai hui he
 If we talk about Narendra Modi as a person, after the 2002 Gujarat riots, if the media raised the most questions and criticized anyone the most, then it is Narendra Modi
 congress ke bhrashtachar or mahangaai ko bhi media ne kaaphi jagah di
 i am not defending the media
 isamen koi do raay nahin ki media ke kaam karne ke tareeke or charitra main bahut badlaav aayaa he
 There is some truth in the questions raised on the media
 kabhi-kabhi aisa lagata he ki media apni takat kaa galat istemaal kar rahaa he
 Talk of 'paid news' is also being raised
 yah bhi sawaal uth rahaa he ki kya media main bhi bhrashtachar he? media ke kawarej ko lekar bhi sawaal uth rahaa he
 The question also arises whether the media is running away from its social responsibility? media main aajkal saamaajik khabaren kam dikhaai detii hai
 Attempts are being made to lure the audience through snakes, scorpions and ghosts
 jo netaa media par sawaal uthaate rahe hai, aajkal unki khabar media dwaara zyada dikhaai jaati hai
 The reach of the media has certainly expanded, but the media seems untouched by the problems of the people of the villages
 jo ho, har kisi ko ek hi taraazoo main taulnaa shaayad thik nahin he
 There are many news channels and newspapers, which work for the larger interest of society by trying to maintain the image of the media through their honest reporting and analysis
 tippaniyan It is not that the media does not do any good
 desh main hue bade-bade ghotaalon ko media ne hi uthaaya he, kai aise samachar channel or akhbaar samaaj kii samasyaon ke prati sachet hai or unhone kuch vishesh abhiyaan bhi shuru kiye hai
 It may not be much, but the media has also shown the problems of farmers in the last few days
 nirbhaya cond jaise maamalon main hamane media ko nae rup main dekha
 It was because of his activism and outspokenness that the civil outrage over the Nirbhaya incident took the form of a mass movement and finally the anti-sexual violence laws were amended
 sarkaar or media ke bich nokajhonk bhi hoti rahati he, lekin media kii azaadi par roak lagaana acchhee baat nahin
 Media must get complete freedom to show news
 sarkaar yaa rajanetaaon ko hakeekat samajni hogi
 Using the media only for your own benefit and hammering at the right of the media when needed will be like hitting an ax at your feet
 dilli sarkaar ke is circular main warren hestings kaa bhoot nazar aa rahaa he
 Before independence, anyone who wrote against the British had to go to jail
 'da bengal gajet' ke sampadak james augustus ko us vakt ke governor general warren hestings kii patni kii aalochana karne ke kaaran chaar maheene jail kii sajaa kaatane ke saath-saath paanch sau rupee jurmaana dena padaa tha

 saanp, bichchhu, bhoot-pret ke jariye darshakon ko lubhaane kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 The leaders who have been questioning the media, nowadays their news is shown more by the media
 media kii pahunch kaa vistaar zarur hua he, lekin media gaanvon ke logon kii samasyaon se achoota najar aa rahaa he
 Whatever it is, it is probably not okay to weigh everyone in the same scales
 bahut-se aise samachar channel or akhbaar hai, jo apni eemaandaar reporting or vishleshanon se media kii chhavi acchhee banaae rakhane kii koshish karte hue samaaj ke vyapak hit ke liye kaam karte hai
 The comments aisa nahin he ki media koi acha kaam nahin karata
 The media has raised major scams in the country, many such news channels and newspapers are conscious of the problems of the society and they have also started some special campaigns
 ho saktaa he zyada na ho, lekin pichley kuch dinon main media ne kisaanon kii samasyaon ko bhi dikhaaya he
 In cases like the Nirbhaya incident, we saw the media in a new way
 uski sakriyata or mukharata kii vajah se hi nirbhaya cond par upja naagarik aakrosh jan-andolan kaa rup le sakaa or aakhirkaar yonhinsa virdohi kanoonon main sanshodhan hue
 There is also a flurry between the government and the media, but curbing the freedom of media is not a good thing
 khabar dikhaane ke liye media ko puri azaadi milani chahie
 The government or politicians have to understand the reality
 sirf apane phaayde ke liye media kaa istemaal karnaa or zarurat padane par media ke haq par hathaudaa maarna apane pairon par hi kulhadi maarane jaisaa hoga
 Arvind Kejriwal has also said that the media continues to promote Modi and the Bharatiya Janata Party
 pichley ek saal main centre main narendra modi sarkaar kii bhi kaaphi khinchaai hui he
 If we talk about Narendra Modi as a person, after the 2002 Gujarat riots, if the media raised the most questions and criticized anyone the most, then it is Narendra Modi
 congress ke bhrashtachar or mahangaai ko bhi media ne kaaphi jagah di
 i am not defending the media
 isamen koi do raay nahin ki media ke kaam karne ke tareeke or charitra main bahut badlaav aayaa he
 There is some truth in the questions raised on the media
 kabhi-kabhi aisa lagata he ki media apni takat kaa galat istemaal kar rahaa he
 Talk of 'paid news' is also being raised
 yah bhi sawaal uth rahaa he ki kya media main bhi bhrashtachar he? media ke kawarej ko lekar bhi sawaal uth rahaa he
 The question also arises whether the media is running away from its social responsibility? media main aajkal saamaajik khabaren kam dikhaai detii hai
 Attempts are being made to lure the audience through snakes, scorpions and ghosts
 jo netaa media par sawaal uthaate rahe hai, aajkal unki khabar media dwaara zyada dikhaai jaati hai
 The reach of the media has certainly expanded, but the media seems untouched by the problems of the people of the villages
 jo ho, har kisi ko ek hi taraazoo main taulnaa shaayad thik nahin he
 There are many news channels and newspapers, which work for the larger interest of society by trying to maintain the image of the media through their honest reporting and analysis
 tippaniyan It is not that the media does not do any good
 desh main hue bade-bade ghotaalon ko media ne hi uthaaya he, kai aise samachar channel or akhbaar samaaj kii samasyaon ke prati sachet hai or unhone kuch vishesh abhiyaan bhi shuru kiye hai
 It may not be much, but the media has also shown the problems of farmers in the last few days
 nirbhaya cond jaise maamalon main hamane media ko nae rup main dekha
 It was because of his activism and outspokenness that the civil outrage over the Nirbhaya incident took the form of a mass movement and finally the anti-sexual violence laws were amended
 sarkaar or media ke bich nokajhonk bhi hoti rahati he, lekin media kii azaadi par roak lagaana acchhee baat nahin
 Media must get complete freedom to show news
 sarkaar yaa rajanetaaon ko hakeekat samajni hogi
 Using the media only for your own benefit and hammering at the right of the media when needed will be like hitting an ax at your feet
 main media kaa bachaav nahin kar rahaa hum
 There is no doubt that there is a lot of change in the way the media works and the character
 media par uthe sawaalon main kahin na kahin sachai bhi he
 Sometimes it seems that the media is misusing its power
 'ped news' kii baat bhi uthaai ja rahi he

 Sister Alfosana Porthor, the church's in-charge, who runs the Nitya Seva Niketan, says that all the children were admitted to the Church of the Lady of Fatima High School, but they did not go to school
 parthur kahati hai, 'ham un bacchon ke ghar main hi unki class lagavate the
 He used to go to school only to take the exam yahaan tak ki pariksha parinaam bhi un tak pahunchaa die jate the
 'the special thing is that after the expulsion of the children, the practice of admitting them to a boarding school started on 6 June, but only 6 days after admission, the school asked Porthr to take the children
 skool ne bataaya ki unhen bacchon ke kaaran kai abhibhavakon se naaraazgi jhelni pad rahi he
 As the matter progresses, the Church has decided that all 13 HIV positive children will be admitted to a nearby school
 haalanki skool kaa naam saarvajanik nahin kiya gaya he taaki bacchon ko samasya na ho
 On the other hand, it has also been decided that 23 other orphans will not be expelled and will study in the Lady of Fatima School
 abhibhavakon ne di dhamkibataya jaataa he ki skool main duusare bacchon ke mata-pita ne anaath bacchon ke khilaaf pradarshan kiya he

 This statement of Rathore comes after the statement given by Wada
 wada ne apane bayaan main bisisiai ke us daawey ko galat bataaya tha, jisamen kaha gaya tha ki rashtriya doping agency (nadaa) ko board ke cricket khilaadiyon kii dope jaanch karaane kaa koi adhikaar nahin he, kyonki bisisiai rashtriya khel mahasang (enesuef) ke adheen nahin aata or uskaa maujuuda anti doping tantra wada ke niyamon ke antargat kaam karata he
 Rathore said, "three people are very important to us - players, coaches and fans
 jab doping hoti he, to prashansakon ke saath dhokhaa hota he, kyonki prashansak khilaadiyon ko apane adarsh kii tarah maanate hai
 Doping betrays the confidence of fans, so it is important for the home sports association to ensure that there is no cheating in the game
 'rathore ne kaha, 'cricket isse achoota nahin he
 i am happy that cricket is controlling dope from outside agency, but when the whole country is relying on NADA, then cricket players should also trust it
 haalanki, hamane wada par sab kuch chhod diya he kyonki isisi uske adheen he
 Rathore, who won a medal in the 2004 Athens Olympics, said that if the WADA investigates the players, the ministry has no problem
 unhone kaha, 'jab isisi wada ke adheen he to use uske doping niyamon kaa paalan karnaa chahie or yah wada par nirbhar karata he ki vah is baat ko aashwast karen ki cricket khilaadiyon kaa dope test ho
 We have no complaints from this time
 'wada or bisisiai ke bich is samay kaaphi vivaad chal rahaa he
 Wada came to know from nada's April audit report that the BCCI does not follow NADA nor does it follow the anti-doping program in cricket
 agency ke mutabik bisisiai ne saaf taur par wada kii bhartiya cricket khilaadiyon ke dope test kii maang ko thukraa diya tha
 As per WADA rules, players have to report their place and time for dope test to the ICC in the quarter of every year and they will have to be available for one hour every day

 Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) leader Raj Thackeray has targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi through cartoons
 raaj thakare ne pradhanmantri narendra modi ke rajyasabha main die bhaashan par ek cartoon banaaya he
 PM Modi was speaking on Wednesday in a vote of thanks on the President's address
 is cartoon main gandhi piem narendra modi ko kuch samajhaate hue najar aa rahe hai
 Patel and Nehru are also seen in this cartoon who are sitting behind Gandhi
 modi ne apane bhaashan main in teenon netaaon kaa zikr kiya tha
 Modi had said that Gandhi's thinking was not 'congress free speech', because after getting independence, he said that Congress should not exist anymore
 iske baad modi ne congress par sarkaar patel ko piem na banaakar jawahar laal nehru ko piem banane kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 This is the cartoon of Thackeray
 cartoon main mahatma gandhi piem modi ko yah samajhaate najar aa rahe hai ki unke kehane par hi nehru ko piem banaaya gaya tha
 The cartoon is in Marathi language, in which Gandhi is saying to Modi- Hey son Narendra, i tell you two things
 pehali baat- jawahar laal nehru ko congress ne nahin maine piem banaaya tha
 Do you have anything to say on this? Secondly - even if Sardar Patel was the Home Minister of the country, he was also the leader of the Congress
 tum headgavar or golwalkar kii murti na banaakar patel kii murti kyon banavaa rahe ho? tum to ek sangh prachaarak ho naa?cartoon main piem modi ke peeche bhartiya janata party ke adhyaksh amit shah bhi dikh rahe hai jo chhipate najar aa rahe hai
 In such a situation, all kinds of options are being said to be open to form the government of Nagaland

 ) The heat of politics is evident in the winter of Delhi
 ek ore to sansad main dharmantaran par vipaksh ke tikhe baan chal rahe hai, to duusari ore teen yadav netaa kendra sarkaar ko ukhaad phenkane kii jugat main mahadharana or mahavilay main vyast hai
 The government is not shaken by the two-sided attack, but its leaders have definitely got force
 sansad kaa na chalane dena vipaksh kii ranneeti kaa ek hissaa he or sarkaar kaa maananaa he ki iske peeche chaal yah he ki mahatvapurn bilon ko paarit hone se roka jaae
 a large part of the winter session of Parliament has been left in the noise of the opposition, now how will the government pass the bills in the remaining time
 lekin usase bhi dilachasp to he chah dalon ke netaaon kaa jantar mantar par mahadharana or mahavilay kii taiyaariyaan
 With Bihar's election in view, the possibilities of merger of Nitish Kumar and Lalu Prasad's party have increased, it is a different matter that Nitish Kumar will do political harm by doing so
 bihar ne unhen lalu prasad ke kushasan ke khilaaf sushasan purush ke rup main chunaa tha or vah janata kii ummiido par khare bhi utre the lekin narendra modi se vyaktigat matbhed ke kaaran unhone ek alag rasta chunaa
 Now going a step ahead, he wants to hand over his party to his strong opponent Lalu Prasad
 jo loglalu prasad kii kaaryastylee jaanate hai unhen pataa he ki ve kis tarah se kaam karte hai or vidhwans kii unki shakti kitni he
 Lalu is no longer a force in Bihar, yes, he is definitely the biggest leader of his caste
 lalu donon partiyon ke voton kaa pratishat jodakar maan rahe hai kiagar donon saath ho jaaen, to bihar kii kursi par phir se kabja ho saktaa he
 Obviously, they have put all their strength
 apni choti beti kaa vivaah sapa supremeo mulaayam singh ke bhai ke pote se tay karke vah unase apane sambandhon ko pakkaa bhi karnaa chaahate hai
 After this relationship, he also hopes to become a force in the country's politics
 lalu ko bakhubi pataa he ki upi ke dilli se sate hue hone ke kaaran mulaayam singh kii yahaan upasthiti hameshaa rahegi or unki chhatra-chaaya main dilli main vah apni awaz uthaa sakenge
 Actually this Mahadharna and Mahavilaya is a knock of political ambitions rather than a political mission
 karnataka kii raajnneeti main lagbhag shunya ho gaye devgauda or haryana main saaf ho gaye chautaala koi raajnneetik takat nahin hai
 They neither have public support nor do they see any future
 shor machaane ke liye to ye dal thik hai lekin hai bina janaadhar ke
 These parties, which were defeated badly in the Lok Sabha elections, may be stuck in the functioning of the government right now, but it will be interesting to see what they will be able to do in the elections
 baharhaal ek dilachasp raajnneetik drishy hamaare saamne hai jiske paatr beete samay ke kalakaar hai jo bhavishya ke sitare banane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 But the problem is that they do not have anything new, then let's look at it and wait for the change of time
 bharat or france ke bich hui rafel deal par france ke raashtrapati emanuel maikron ne kaha he ki yadi bharat is mudde par vipaksh ke saath kisi tarah kii bahes ke liye deal kii kuch baarikiyon se pardaa uthaanaa chahta he to france sarkaar virodh nahin karegi
 In an interview to India Today, Macron said that economic, industrial and strategic interests have been taken care of in this deal
 haalanki, maikron ne kaha ki yah deal unke kaarykaal main nahin kii gai he lekin unka maananaa he ki is deal se donon deshon ko phayda hua he
 On the confidentiality being dealt with on the deal, Macron said that it is not appropriate to make disclosures when there is a lot of sensitive business interest between the two countries
 maikron ne kaha ki is deal main commercial agreement ke tahat pratiyogi companiyon ko deal kii baarikiyon kii jaankaree nahin honi chahie
 This commercial agreement is related to the interests of some companies, so privacy is justified
 ise padhein: rafel par bole jetali, sawaal uthaane se pehle pranab se jaakar milen rahulmacron ne kaha ki kuch technical muddon par rahasy keval commercial agreement ke kaaran he
 Macron claimed that his government would have no objection if the Modi government in India wanted to cover up some of the specifics in the dialogue with the opposition amid controversies over the deal
 bharat or france ke bich is raksha samjhaute par maikron ne kaha yah deal ek achche negociation ke maahaul main hui he
 Along with this, this deal is very important for India's security
 maikron ke mutabik rafel deal bharat or france ke bich vrihad sahmati ke ek hisse ke taur par yah deal he
 Macron told India Today that according to him the Government of India had put his country's side well
 aalochakon ko galat sabit karne kii koshish main jute suresh raina ne kaha ki vah test cricket ke liye bane hai or short gend behatar tareeke se khilne par kaam kar rahe hai
 Raina said, 'I know that i am made for Test cricket
 maine test main acha pradarshan kiya he
 i played well in the West Indies last year
 england ke khilaaf pehla test bhi mere liye acha rahaa tha
 i am working hard
 ’unhone kaha, ‘chah yaa saat number sthaan par ballebaaji karnaa mushkil hota he
 So i will ensure that whenever i get a chance i prove that i have the ability to be a good Test player
 ’raina se yah poochne par ki unhen simit over kaa khilaadi mana jaataa he to unhone kaha, ‘log mujhe vanade kaa khilaadi kehete hai, lekin unhen bolne dijie
 i know that i have time
 main test main aath yaa nau baar spinneron ke khilaaf out hua hum or main is par kaam kar rahaa hum
 i have won T20 and odis for India, but i have not got such an opportunity in Tests
 ’ "don't go to Kochi, come back
" We’ll make you a Minister and help you in whatever way you want
