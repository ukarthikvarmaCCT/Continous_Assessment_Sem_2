 Had to do it but critics say in unison that it is not going to make much difference

 According to experts and opposition parties, the impact of companies in the political decision process has been strengthened by the removal of limits on the donations of companies and the introduction of election bonds

 By the way, the biggest concern of the opposition parties is the election bond issued this year

 '' unke sahyogi gauda kehete hai, "chunavi bond to nagarikon ke jaanane ke adhikaar kii mul bhaavana kaa hi hanan karte hai

 Says Rawat, "right now we are examining the report of contributions made to political parties after the launch of these bonds to understand whether the government has addressed our concerns or not
 hamen isamen paardarshita ke str kaa pataa bhi jald hi chal jayega
 However, Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley justifies the provision of not disclosing sources in electoral bonds

 The finance minister claimed that past experiences have shown that due to anonymity, donors were forced to go to the same old option of donating in cash which is not desirable
 ''haalanki visheshgy in tarkon se sahamat nahin hai
 a senior Election Commission official said that it would be a sad state of affairs for Indian democracy if one feared that donating to such a party meant displeasing the other party and then becoming angry with it

 '' isse surajevaala ke us daawey ko majbootee milti he ki chunavi treston ke daan ke record ko khangaal kar yah pataa lagaaya ja sakegaa ki koun-sa daandaata kis dal ke prati apana samarthan jataata he
 The Electoral Trust, which started in 2013, was the UPA government's way of creating a layer of ambiguity in the process of corporate donations to parties
 ye trust vibhinn companiyon se yogadan praapt kar sakate hai or us dhan ko vibhinn partiyon ko baant sakate hai
 By this, the public cannot know which company is actually paying the money to which party, and the transaction in its place will remain unknown
 2015-16 main 21 panjikrut chunavi treston main yogadan kii 90 fisadi raashi, sattarudh dal ke paas gai thi

 Critics of the party say that the reason why the BJP is not accepting the Election Commission's suggestions for fixing the election expenditure limit of political parties is because it is far ahead of other parties in the power of money

 Rawat believes that setting the limit for political parties 'expenditure will prove to be a very important step in terms of the economic purity of elections, but for this political parties' commitment is also necessary

 Confusion over the controversial rotation policy targeted by critics further increased when Virender Sehwagne said that he did not know that it was being done because of the fielding ability

 There was only one nurse in the village hospital

 Therefore, on the complaint of the villagers, Bhanwari Devi was suspended from her job

 com / hbrd3aby9x deshbhar se kai maanavadhikaar kaaryakartaaon kii giraftaar par supreme court kii tippanee aam bhaavana ko hi zaahir karti he
 
 
 The largest court in the country has said, disagreement is a safety valve for democracy, and if you press it like a pressure cooker, it will explode
 
 
 agar aap sefti volve ko apana kaam karne kii anumati nahin denge,to pressure cooker fat jayega
 
 
 Now everyone wants to know whether these five people were really plotting to kill Prime Minister Narendra Modi, or are these arrests part of electoral strategy
 
 
 darasal,pune ke bhima-koregaanv main mahaar sainikon ke balidaan kii smriti main dalit sanghathanon ke zariye lambey samay se kaaryakramon kaa aayojan hota rahaa he
 
 
 This year, the event organized by the Yalgar Parishad was special because of the completion of 200 years of the event, in which people of humanitarian, socialist, leftist and Ambedkarite thinking had reached from all over the country
 
 
 ab is tarah ke aayojan ko maovadiyon kaa aayojan qaraar dena ek prakaar se dalit asmita ko nakaarna hi mana jayega
 
 
 The biggest irony is that Maharashtra is becoming a stronghold of different right-wing thinking or ultra-hinduist thinking or movement
 
 
 thik vaise hi,jaisaa karnataka main dekhne ko miltaa he
 
 
 This ultra-hinduist thought killed Pansare and Dabholkar in Maharashtra, while Kalburgi and Gauri Lankesh fell victim to it in Karnataka
 
 
 ab dalit samaaj ke aayojan ko maowad se jodna babasaheb bhimrao ambedkar kaa bhi apmaan he,jinhone aapako samvidhan diya,magar dikkat he ki dalit-virdohi log samvidhan main aasthaa rakhte bhi hai yaa nahin
 
 
 Now people are being given a new label that those who are not with the government or have their separate or independent ideology, are 'urban naxalites'
 
 
 yah to vahi baat hui,jo aedin soshal media par dikhti he - yadi aap mere saath nahin hai,to deshadrohi hai
 
 
 It is also true that Naxalism is a big problem, but that is because they have taken up arms and target the soldiers through guerrilla battles
 
 
 magar ye'shahari naksali've log hai,jinamein koi vakil he,koi kavi,or koi saamaajik kaaryakarta he
 
 
 They are respected people of this society
 
 
 supreme court ne isiilie in sabhi ko nazarband rakhane kii anumati di he,giraftaar karne kii nahin
 
 
 The court has also asked that the government should tell the court why there was a need to treat these people like criminals
 
 
 sach main,jab samaaj main kanoon amanviya hon or sarkaar apane virodh main kuch bhi sunne ke liye taiyaar na ho,to ek hi aasraa bachataa he - supreme court - or is baar bhi kuch aisa hi hota dikh rahaa he

 bhabhua seat ke liye congress kaa tark he ki pichley chunaav main vahaan se argedy yaa congress kaa koi ummidavaar nahin tha
 In the 2015 assembly elections, the Janata dal-u candidate stood on this seat from the Grand Alliance

 It is believed that Ramchandra Yadav may be RJD candidate from Bhabua

 Now Janata Dal United and BJP are in alliance
 isliye sitting seat hone ke naate daawa bijepi kaa hi he
 RJD has a sitting MLA in Jehanabad seat, so no other party has claimed from UPA
 jabaki endie kii taraf se pichley chunaav main ye seat rashtriya loksamata party ko gai thi
 Now the RLSP has a claim on this seat, but we party president Jitan Ram Manjhi is also contesting from here

 The BJP high command has devised a multi-pronged strategy to neutralize the anti-incumbency trend in the assembly elections of the three party-ruled states — Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan
 haalanki rajasthan main mushkil pesh aa rahi he
 The main strategy of the party is the same old Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be the trump card to woo the voters and the State Kshatrap and BJP President Amit Shah will play the role of Commander for the party workers
 vipaksh ko vibhajit rakhane kii shah kii ranneeti ke najaare unke andarkhaane kartabon ke kai rup main dikh rahe hai
 This was reflected in the opposition's failed attempts to form a grand alliance, when Mayawati's BSP has refused to join hands with the Congress in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh
 phir, chhattisgarh main ajit jogi kii party ke congress ke badale basapa se gathjod karne main bhi dikhaa, jisase vahaan muqabla trikoniya ho gaya he
 Obviously, this has made the road easier for the BJP in the state to a great extent and its prospects are beginning to increase
 kamjor kadiyakeenan pradhanmantri kii kalyankari or buniyadi dhaanche se sambandhit yojanaayen in teen rajyon main centre kaa mukhya aadhaar hai
 However, Rajasthan's strategy has been tweaked as the BJP central leadership is considering a weaker state against Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje (as against Shivraj Singh Chauhan in Madhya Pradesh and Raman Singh in Chhattisgarh)
 iske alaava rajasthan main matdaan kaa itihaas bhi dhyaan main rakhaa ja rahaa he jahaan har paanch saal main congress or bhaajapa ke bich baari-baari se satta badalati rahati he, jabaki madhya pradesh or chhattisgarh main pichley 15 varshon se bhaajapa satta main he
 Not only this, the BJP State Party is also fully organized in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh and in contrast the opposition is divided among themselves
 madhya pradesh main congress ke varisht netaa kamalnath, jyotiraditya sindhiya or digvijay singh ne shaayad party kii chunaav ranneeti ko pechida bana diya hai
 In fact, Digvijay Singh is showing some displeasure
 duusari ore shivaraj singh chouhan kaa rajya bhaajapa main puraa dabadabaa he
 Due to his humility and the success of some welfare schemes for the poor, he remains popular among the public
 chhattisgarh main raman singh ko apni party main koi chunauti nahin he, vahiin jogi kii chaal ne bhaajapa kaa kaam aasaan bana diya he
 The state BJP in Rajasthan has its eyes of internal strife
 vasundhara raaje ko party ke rashtriya upaadhyaksh om maathur ke alaava kendriya krishi mantri gajendra singh shekhavat kii ore se bhi virodh kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 In April, Raje vehemently opposed Shah's proposal to make Shekhawat the head of the state party (she saw this as an attempt to reduce her influence in the state)
 mukhyamantri ne iskaa itnaa kadaa virodh kiya tha ki party alaakaman ko apana faisla radd karnaa padaa
 In this way Raje is also at loggerheads with the party high command apart from some leaders of the state BJP
 inhen vajahon se party ne kendriya maanav sansaadhan mantri prakaash jaavdekar ko rajasthan main chunaav prabharee niyukt kiya he
 The central leadership of the party has once again reposed faith in him in view of his excellent work in Karnataka
 karnataka main party main isse bhi zyada foot thi
 Removing the differences in the state unit is a big challenge for Javadekar
 lekin ve is baat se chintit nahin hai
 He says, "we will win elections despite anti-incumbency trends
" isaki vajah yah he ki mukhyamantri ne jal prabandhan or anya kshetron main acha kaam kiya he
 Apart from this, there is also the charisma of the Prime Minister who shows his influence on everyone across caste and regional boundaries
 votaron ke liye hamaara yahi sandesh he ki rajasthan ko bhavishya main vikaas ke liye dohare ingine kii jarurat he, pradesh main vasundhara raaje or dilli main pradhanmantri modi
 "but the easier it is to say it, the harder it is to do
" madhya pradesh or chhattisgarh kii tulana main congress rajasthan main ashok gahalot or sachin payalat ke bich matbhedon ke baavjood kahin zyada sangathit he
 One of the main weapons of the central command strategy is that it will identify the beneficiaries of each of the five successful schemes of the Center and the state at the booth level in all three states and make them aware of the common people
 motorcykilon or smartphone se las party ke kaaryakarta in labhaarthiyon ke saath booth str par baithken yojit karte hai
 The plan is monitored by party general secretary Ram Lal in Delhi
 shah kaa maananaa he ki matdaan ke din iskaa kaaphi asar hoga
 Five schemes of the Center- providing LPG at cheaper rates under Ujjwala, providing loans from the bank to unskilled workers without any collateral under the "mudra" scheme, Grameen Griha Yojana for the homeless, Jan Dhan Bank Account for the poor, And the Rural Roads Plan — has had a tremendous impact in these three states
 udhaaharan ke liye ujjwala yojana ke tahat madhya pradesh main 53 lakh or rajasthan main 41 lakh gas conection die gaye
 In Madhya Pradesh, the number of beneficiaries of Mudra loan is 93 lakhs and in Rajasthan about 50 lakhs
 isi tarah gramin awaas yojana ke tahat madhya pradesh main 10 lakh or rajasthan main 40,000 logon ko laabh mila he jabaki jan dhan yojana ke tahat rajasthan main 2,54,000 bank khate or madhya pradesh main 2
 88 crore bank accounts were opened
 pradhanmantri kii gramin sadak yojana ke antargat madhya pradesh main 2,100 kimi or rajasthan main 13,000 kimi se zyada sadakon kaa nirmaan hua he
 The figures of these schemes are very attractive even in a small state like Chhattisgarh
 madhya pradesh main chunaav prabharee kendriya mantri dharmendra pradhan kehete hai, "pradesh main centre or rajya kii yojanaon kii safalataa hamaari takat he
 We will take it to the public against the Congress' poor record
 log 15 saal ke hamaare shashan ke baavjood congress ke kushasan ko nahin bhuule hai
 "yatra Tatra is the most important part of Sarvatrabhajpa's strategy to establish contact with the beneficiaries of central schemes under its digital program
 yah ranneeti ek baar phir modi ke irdagird buni gai he
 In these contact programs, the Prime Minister will address millions of viewers
 iske tahat adhikari ilaake ke logon ko gram panchayat ke saamudayik seva kendron (siessi) main le aate hai jahaan ve video conferencing ke jariye pradhanmantri se sidhe baatcheet kar sakate hai
 Apart from this, people can also participate in it by using the Narendra Modi app
 is digital model kaa istemaal booth str par party kaaryakartaaon se sampark karne ke liye bhi kiya ja rahaa he
 This model has already been prepared
 is tarah kii har baatcheet main pradhanmantri ek hi baar main paanch loksabhaa nirvachan kshetron ke booth str ke kareeb 75,000 kaaryakartaaon ko sambodhit karte hai
 This conversation usually lasts from 90 minutes to two hours
 jaahir he, is baatcheet main aam taur par jor sarkaar kii yojanaon kii safalataa ko logon tak pahunchane par hota he, isliye adhikari labhaarthiyon ko "pehle se taiyaar karke'' jutate hai taaki siessi ke aayojanon kaa puraa asar pad sake
 Similar preparations are also done in video conference meetings with party workers
 pradhanmantri se baat karne ke liye aise anukaraniya logon ko chunaa jaataa he jinke udaahranon se kaarykram ke darshakon par "sakaaratmak asar'' pad sake
 Amit Malviya, national in-charge of bjp's social media wing, says, "the Prime Minister is reaching out to millions of party workers and beneficiaries through every such event, that too by sitting in a studio in Delhi
" yah ek rajnatik masterstroke he jiskaa koi muqabla nahin he
 According to an estimate, by the time elections begin, Modi would have addressed 50 lakh people in these three states
 lekin in ranneetiyon ke baavjood anti-inkambency se jujhane kii duusari koshishen bhi jari rahengi
 The party's focus will be on Amit Shah's booth management policy
 iske tahat panna pramukh niyukt kiye jate hai jinhen votaron ko laane kii jimmedaar di jaati he

 Gautam Gambhir's 97-run innings was also an important contribution to Team India's victory in the match but Gambhir's innings in making India the champion did not get the credit it deserved

 The memory of this World Cup final against Sri Lanka is reminiscent of the six of Team India's captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni
 maahi ne srilanka gendbaaj nuwan kulsekara kii gend par yah chakka jadkar jaise hi team india ko jeet dilaai, yah cricketpremiyon kii yaad main baskar rah gaya
 The film 'MS Dhoni: The Untold Story' focused on Mahendra Singh Dhoni further enhanced the 'buzz' of this six
 (berthde vishesh : gautam gambhir ke naam he khaas uplabdhi, jise sachin, gavaskar bhi nahin hasil kar paae) In the film trailer, Sushant Singh Rajput, who played Dhoni, was shown hitting this six, but in this six's 'dhoom', the match of a batsman of Team India was left as if the match was won

 Chasing Sri Lanka's score, Team India lost explosive batsman Virender Sehwag on the second ball of the innings
 team ke khate main ek bhi ran nahin tha or pehla wicket out ho chukaa tha
 Gambhir, who came for batting on the first order, was not yet set up properly that second opener Sachin Tendulkar (18 runs) also became the victim of Lasith Malinga

 If Dhoni worked to increase the score fast, Gambhir 'sealed' one end and kept the opposition bowlers away from success for a long time

 After the dismissal of Sehwag, Sachin, if the team lost one or two wickets ahead of India, the road to the final victory could have been extremely difficult
 lekin gambhir ne is mushkil kshanon main dhairya kaa parichay diya or pehle viraat or phir dhoni ke saath saajhedaari kar team kii jeet ke kareeb pahunchaaya
 Dhoni's subsequent win with an unbeaten 91 and sixes left such an impression on the minds of cricket fans that the final is best remembered for the Indian captain's charisma

 co / maoa6awmtd— vidya balan (@vidya_balan)november 11, 2016aap bhi dekhen gaanaa: In order to clear the misconceptions about life imprisonment, the Supreme Court has said in one of its important verdict that life imprisonment means that the convict will have to remain in jail
 nyaayalay ne yah bhi kaha ki saal 1980 main isaki sanvaidhanik peeth ne apane faisle main maut kii sajaa die jane kii jo kasautiyaan bataayi thim un par 'phir se vichaar kii jarurat' he kyonki jin siddhanton ke aadhaar yah sajaa sunaayi ja rahi he unamem 'ekarupata nahin' he
 The apex court said in its judgment, 'we feel that there is some misconception that a prisoner serving a life sentence has full right to be released after completion of 14 years or 20 years
 kaidi ko aisa koi adhikaar nahin he
 "A bench of Justice KS Radhakrishnan and Justice Madan B
 Lokur said," The convict serving life sentence has to remain in custody till the end of his life
 vah isse pehle tabhi reeha kiya ja saktaa he jab sarkaar kii ore se uski sajaa main koi chhot di jaae
 However, the bench clarified that the government cannot reduce the punishment period to less than 14 years while granting remission to a prisoner serving life imprisonment
 ucchtam nyaayalay ne apane faisle main kaha, 'umrakaid kii sajaa kaat rahaa kaidi anishchit avadhi tak hiraasat main rahegaa
 Therefore, if a prisoner serving a life sentence is exempted from punishment, it should not be considered a rule as it cannot be done in every case and it is based on facts
 ' nyaayalay ne kaha, 'aise maamalon main sajaa kii avadhi kam karne ke liye sarkaar ko siarpisi kii dhara 432 ke tahat ek vishesh aadesh paarit karnaa hoga
 However, the punishment period under Section 433-A of crpc cannot be reduced to less than 14 years
 'ucchtam nyaayalay ke is faisle se ab 'tyoharon' yaa 'vishesh avasaron' par sarkaron kii ore se badi taadaad main kaidiyon kii rihaai ke chalan par bhi roak lagegi
 The bench said that one should be released only after investigating each case
 sheersh nyaayalay ne yah bhi kaha ki maut kii sajaa die jane ke haalia faislon ke aadhaar main 'ekarupata' kii kami dekhi gayi he or ye zyada 'nyaayadhish-kendrit' ho gaye hai
 The bench said, "in the process of sentencing, both the crime and the criminal have equal importance
 lekin badakismati se hamane is prakriya ko utani sanjidagi se nahin liya he jitani gambhirtha se ise liya janaa chahie
 The reason for this is that instead of being based on principles, this process has become focused on judges
 nyaayalay ne kaha, 'is nyaayalay ne bachan singh maamle main aparaadh or apradhi se judi paristhitiyon par vichaar karne ke ravaiye kaa samarthan nahin kiya he
 However, this attitude has been adopted in many decisions
 is par phir se vichaar kii jarurat he
 In any case there has not been uniformity in following this thing
 bachan singh banaam punjab sarkaar ke mashhoor maamle main ucchtam nyaayalay ne apane faisle main do muddon par vichaar kiya tha jisamen pehla ipisi kii dhara 302 ke tahat hatya ke maamle main maut kii sajaa kii sanvaidhanik manyata or doosraa siarpisi kii dhara 354 kii up-dhara (3) main shaamil sajaa dene kii prakriya tha
 The Allahabad High Court ruled in this case on 12 October
 haryana ke yamunanagar main ek nijee skool kii mahila principal kii ek chaatra hatya kiye jane ke maamle main kai chaunkaane vaale khulaase hue hai
 The accused student, studying in school in class 12, has confessed his crime to the police
 police kaa bhi kahana he ki unhen aaropee chaatr ke khilaaf pukhta saboot mil chuke hai
 The incident is from Swami Vivekananda Public School in Yamunanagar, where the accused student Shivansh killed principal Ritu Chhabra while firing bullets from his father's revolver during a parent teacher meeting on Saturday
 shivaansh ne poochtacha ke dauraan police ko bataaya ki usne tivi par aane vaale ek behad mashhoor krime sho ko dekhakar principal kii hatya kii sajeesh rachi thi
 Shivansh was arrested from the spot
 skool main maujuud logon ne hi use pakadaa tha
 According to police, during interrogation, Shivansh said that he often watched the show 'crime Patrol' aired on TV
 usne ek episod aisa bhi dekha tha, jisamen ek chaatr apane teacher kii hatya kar detaa he
 That student too was upset with the teacher
 krime sho ke isi apisod ko dekhakar shivaansh ke man main apane skool kii principal kii hatya karne kaa idia aayaa
 Shivansh has confessed his crime without fear
 SHO omprakash ne bataaya ki aaropee ne hatya kaa jurm kubul kar liya he
 According to SHO, in the interrogation till now, Shivansh stated that he was tortured at school
 isse vah behad pareshaan tha
 Principal Ritu Chhabra had also threatened to expel him from school several times
 usne bataaya ki principal ne uske parijanon se uski shikaayatein bataane kii baat bhi kahi thi
 He feared that he would be scolded if the parents found out
 isliye usne principal kii hatya karne kii yojana banaai, taaki puraa maamla khatm ho jaae
 He took a revolver from home and entered the school directly to carry out the incident
 skool main vah sidhe principal room main ghus gaya
 However, after reaching there, he asked the principal to take practicals
 aaropee ke mutabik, lekinprincipal ne use dhamkaaya
 Then he came out of the principal's office, though immediately he entered his office again and fired all the bullets loaded in the revolver
 usne bataaya ki goliyaan lagane ke baad madam jakhmi ho gai thim
 He did not know then that he would die
 pakade jane ke baad hi use madam kii maut hone kaa pataa chalaa
 However, the police also suspected that Shivansh was drunk while carrying out the incident
 apane shaq kii pushti ke liye police ne uske blad sample liye hai, jinhen forencik lab bheja gaya he
 The accused says that he came alone from home and alone he carried out the entire incident

 During the tenure of Team India's most successful bowler, Anil Kumble, India played 17 Test matches, of which the team won 12, drew 4 and lost only in 1 Test
 is dauraan bharat test main number-1 bana rahaa
 The news is that the way Kumble has led the campaign to increase the salaries of the players and support staff has gone back to the old members of the BCCI
 kumble or kohli ne supreme court dwaara niyukt COA yani Committee of Administrators ke saamne apana paksh rakhaa tha
 Kohli and Kumble are demanding an increase of about 150% in fees
 COA ke adhyaksh vinod raay or vikram limaye ne board ke sadasyon ko maamle ko dekhne ke liye kaha

 com / obcyqhs2dj congress 2019 main bhartiya janata party ko satta se dur rakhane ke liye abhi se plan main jute gai he
 According to party sources, to stop the BJP, the Congress may support Mayawati or Mamata Banerjee by accepting him as the Prime Minister
 lekin aisi sthiti tab aegi jab congress ko ummid se kam siten milengi
 In fact, the Congress does not want to be scattered in the Grand Alliance at any cost
 vaise to congress kaary samiti kii baithak main party ke tamaam netaaon ne congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ko mahagathbandhan kaa netritv saunpane kii baat kahi thi
 Soon after, jd's statement came that it had no problem with the leadership of Rahul Gandhi
 lekin bihar se mangalvaar se virodh kii aawaaj ai
 Tejashwi Yadav, son of RJD leader and Lalu Prasad Yadav said that Rahul Gandhi is not alone in the race for the post of PM from the opposition
 unhone kaha ki sabhi vipakshi dal ek saath baithenge or pradhanmantri ke ummidavaar ke naam par faisla karenge
 On Wednesday, Mayawati gave a sharp message to the Congress that an alliance in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh is possible only if her party gets respectable seats
 agar is samjhaute main sammanjanak siten nahin milti hai to bhi unki party akele ladane ko puri tarah taiyaar he
 Significantly, after the Congress Working Committee (CWC) meeting, the Congress Party has declared Rahul Gandhi as the PM candidate for 2019
 baithak ke baad party pravaktaa randeep surajevaala ne kaha, 'congress kaa nirnay sateek, sapaat or spasht he
 Rahul Gandhi is our face
 ham unke netritv main janata ke bich jaaenge
 We will naturally have the same face when we are the largest party
 isamen shaq kii koi gunjaaish nahin he
 'but Congress allies in the UPA are hesitant about Rahul's leadership
 rahul kii piem pad kii daavedaari par jedies ko chhodkar koi dal raji nahin dikh rahaa he
 Mamta Banerjee has refused to speak on this
 jabaki basapa netaaon ne pehle hi mayawati ko gathbandhan kaa piem cheharaa banane kaa faisla kiya he
 BSP leaders are not ready to say anything in Rahul's name, they say that Mayawati will decide on it
 akhilesh yadav pehle hi kah chuke hai ki chunaav ke baad gathbandhan kaa netaa tay hoga
 In such a situation, the Congress is working on every front and in this episode, the party has now indicated that if such a situation arises after the election, then there is no avoiding of making Mayawati or Mamata Banerjee as PM
 congress or aam aadmi party (AAP) par hamalaa karte hue bhartiya janata party (BJP) ke adhyaksh amit shah ne ravivaar ko kaha ki dilli vidhansabha main ek prastaav ko paarit karne ko lekar jo hua, wo 1984 ke sikh virdohi dangon ke peediton ke jakhmon par namak chhidakane ke samaan he
 During this, he also accused Congress President Rahul Gandhi of supporting illegal migrants
 aapako bataa den ki shuukravaar ko dilli vidhansabha ne 1984 ke sikh virdohi dangon par ek prastaav paarit kiya, jisamen yah maang kii gai ki tatkaaleen pradhanmantri rajeev gandhi ko diya gaya ‘bharat ratna’ kaa sammaan waapas liya jaae, lekin AAP ne congress netaa ke sandarbh se khud ko fouran alag kar liya
 Later Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia clarified that the lines written against former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi were not part of the original motion laid before the House
 unhone kaha ki yah ek sadsy dwaara hastlikhit sanshodhan tha, jo is tarah se paarit nahin ho saktaa he
 Amit Shah said that what happened in the Delhi Assembly is like sprinkling salt on the wounds of the victims of the anti-vosikh riots
 unhone bhaajapa ke booth str ke kaaryakartaaon ke sammelan main kaha ki is ghatana ne aam aadmi party ke dohare charitra ko ujagar kar diya he
 He accused the Congress of not giving justice to the victims of the Sikh protest riots for many years, as the perpetrators of the riots (the accused) were the protectors
 amit shah ne kaha ki centre mempradhanmantri narendra modiki aguwai vaali sarkaar ne 4 saal main vishesh jaanch team gathit karke peediton ke liye na sirf nyaay sunishchit kiya, balki prabhavit pariwaron ko muaavja bhi diya
 He also targeted Rahul Gandhi over the Rafale deal
 shah ne kaha, 'rafel saude par supreme court ke faisle ke baavjood rahul gandhi jhooth bol rahe hai or anargal aarope laga rahe hai
 Shah said- Why did the Congress start on NRC cry-wash On illegal migrants, Shah reiterated that the BJP government will identify the intruders and expel them from the country
 unhone National Register of Citizens of India (NRC) par congress ke ruukh ko lekar sawaal kiya
 The BJP leader said, 'NRC exercise started in Assam and as soon as it happened, Rahul Baba & Co
 started crying
 main rahul gandhi se poochna chahta hum ki kya aatanki visphoton main marane vaale deshavaasiyon kii unhen koi chintaa he?'bijepi adhyaksh ne poocha, 'aap unhen lekar kyon chintit hai? kya ve aapke mausere bhai hai?' agle saal hone vaale loksabhaa chunaav ke baad satta main lautne kaa vishwaas jataate hue bhaajapa adhyaksh ne kaha ki party kii jeet kaa matlab jatvaad or bhai-bhatijawad par rashtrawaad kii vijay hogi
 He said that the BJP will come to power in 2019 with more mandates than 2014
 ab kejariwal suraksha karmiyon ke saath chalate he: shahanaaf ko nishane par lete hue shah ne kaha ki khud ko aam aadmi bataane vaale dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal suraksha karmiyon ke saath chalate hai
 He asked where are the marshals for women safety in hospitals, schools, CCTV cameras and buses? He alleged that the Kejriwal government has failed to fulfill its promises in Delhi
 shah ne daawa kiya ki modi sarkaar ne dilli ke liye apane vaayade puure kiye hai or bhaajapa 2019 main apane kaam kaa byora matadaataaon ko degi
 He said that it is unfortunate that the Kejriwal government did not allow the Ayushman Bharat scheme to be implemented in Delhi for fear of increasing Modi's popularity
 shah ne congress par neshnal herald imaarat kaa nijee sampatti ke taur par istemaal kar karodon rupee kaa golmaal karne kaa aarope lagaaya

 hindu dharm ke anusaar jyeshtha maas kii amavasya ko shani jayanti kaa parv manaaya jaataa he
 This time of Shani Jayanti, this time is on Saturday
 ek taraf jahaan shani jayanti shanivaar ko padi he, vahiin is din 8 taarikh he
 The 8 digit is considered to be the sign of Saturn, which contains all the powers of Saturn
 vahiin is din sarvaarth siddhi va amrit yoga ke saath hi rohinee nakshatra kaa adbhut sanyog bhi kai varsh baad ban rahaa he
 According to astrologers, the people affected by Shani on this day will get special benefit of worship
 jyotishiyon kaa kahana he ki is jayanti par agar shani se jude daan kar kuch mantron kaa jaap kar liya jaae to badhate karj se mukti paane main madad milegi
 Victories will be won over enemies and illnesses that have become life-threatening will be cured
 jin jaatakon ko sadhesati, dhaiyya ke prabhaav ke saath hi shani kii mahadasha va antardasha yaa janm kundalee main shani ke visham prabhaav ke hone se pareshaani hai, shani jayanti par shani dev kaa tel se abhishek karne bhar se unhen raahat mil jaaegi 
 Shani, the god of justice, Shani, the god of Kalyug, Shani who frightens everyone with his crooked gait, and Shani Maharaj, who is pleased with mustard oil, is considered very important in Vedic astrology
 sanathan dharm main shani kii ahmiyat kaa andaja isi baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki shani ko sirf grah nahin, balki nyaay kaa devtaa mana jaataa he
 According to mythology, on the new moon day of Jyeshtha month, Satya's wife Chhaya gave birth to a son, named Shani
 surya jab apane putr ko dekhne pahunche to unke tej se jhulaskar shani kaa rang kaala pad gaya
 Surya realized his mistake, but it was too late by then and Surya suffered immediately
 apane putr shani ko najar bhar dekhte hi surya kaa sara tej dhundhala pad gaya or surya ko grahan lag gaya
 It is said that since then the color of Saturn has become black forever
 sirf shani ke kaale rang kii hi nahin unki tedi chaal kii kahani bhi bahut anokhi he
 It is said that this story is related to the angry nature of Shani Maharaj, it is said that when Shani was a child, one day he asked for food from his mother Chhaya
 bhojan milane main deree hui to gusse main unhone chaaya ko laat maar diya
 The angry shadow of Saturn cursed him to be lame, since then Saturn's move got crooked and his fear grew more, but Shanidev took a lesson from his mistakes and vowed that no one would lie in Kaliyuga
 Or if there is any injustice to anyone, then he will be the victim of Saturn's anger
 yahi vajah he ki unki tedi chaal bhakton ko adharm or anyaay karne se rokatii he

 Second class women were prevented from eating only carbohydrates on two days of the week, but the calorie limit in their meals was not fixed and they were asked to eat their favorite food for the rest of the day
 tisare varg kii mahilaon ko saamaanya diating karne ko kaha gaya, jiske antargat unhen saptaah ke saaton din 1500 calories pratidin ke hisaab se bhojan karnaa tha or vasayukta bhojan se bachanaa tha
 According to the 'daily Mail', the women of the first class lost the most weight, while the women who dieted throughout the week lost half the weight of two kg four hundred grams

 He said stepping on the sacred planets is an insult to religion
 bharat jaise desh main jahaan us vakt sakshartaa kaaphi kam thi, andhvishwaas kaa bolbalaa tha aisi khabar par sahaj yakeen karnaa mushkil tha bhi

 Everything was new for him but his ability to learn quickly came in handy here
 sharma na sirf bharat main lokapriy hue balki rus main bhi unhen kaaphi sammaan mila
 India awarded him the Ashoka Chakra and Russia also awarded him the title of Hero of Soviet Union
 13 janvari 1949 ko paidaa hue rakesh sharma aaj apana 66 waan janmdin manaa rahe hai
 He is now retired and spends time with family
 ek maanavyukt abhiyaan mangal pahunchataa he lekin tufaan kii vajah se unka ek saathi mark vaatani (mat demen) vahiin chhot jaataa he

 The only Buddhist saint of Indian origin who brought this special technique of martial arts was Bodhidharma
 'baharhaal logon ko yah bhram he kikung phu china kii dein he
 But it is true that the people of China learn more and adopt this mode of self-defense
 lekin isse yah to sabit nahin hota he ki kungphu china kii hi khoj ho
 Saint Bodhidharma is said to be the father of Kung Fu
 china ke shaolin main unke naam par kai mandir bane hai
 So it has been speculated that Saint Bodhidharma visited China during the 6th century
 us samay china kaa koi astitv nahin tha, sant to hindkush ke himalay parvat ke us paar rah rahen logon ko buddha dharm kaa gyaan dene gaye the
 But he settled there and shared his unique invention with Kung Fu among the people there
 jisase kung phu us khaas ilaake main puri tarah se phala-phula
 On all these things, Tiger said that 'kung Fu has been invented in India
 kung phu marshall art kii sabase puraani vidha he jisamen bina kisi hathiyaar ke ladaai ladani hoti he
 Like this, it is an art of fighting without fighting
 is baat ko lekar doovidha he ki kung phu bhartiya buddha sant bodhidharma kii shikshaaon par aadhaarit he jo ki chhathin sadi main china main chale gaye the yaa nahin
 But it is certain that Bodhidhidharmajha also took with him a unique form of martial ort
 jaisaa ki kerala kaa kaliripayttu aap abhi dekh sakate hai
 Bodhidharma stayed in the new temple in Sholin and dedicated his entire life to this art along with other Buddhist saints
 samay ke saath-saath kung phu china ke saath puure vishwa main failaa or aaj ise sabasekhataranaak fitingskill mana jaataa he

 And everyone is discussing that secret of the cemetery
 kabhi murde kaa gaanaa suna he? kabhimurdene aapako pukaara he? kabhi dekha he zindaa hote hue kisi murde ko? agar nahin to phir koun dafn he us kabr main? jo marane ke baad bhi gunagunaata he
 Who makes a sound from inside the tomb
 or kahata he ki zindaa hum main
 This is not anyone's imagination
 yah sachhee ghatana he meerut ke ek gaanv kii
 Where a father has pleaded with the district administration that his son Kiakbruko be dug
 kyonki wo rose kabr ke andar se unhen awaz detaa he
 This is the case of Jalalpur village of Meerut

 The fear is visible from their eyes
 har vakt kisi anhoni kaa dar laga rahata he kyonki unke gaanv kaa ek murda subah shaam kabr se awaazen de rahaa he
 People say that he is also humming
 darasal, vah kabr he irfan kii
 Who died 2 months ago
 lekin irfan ke gharavaalon kaa kahana he ki pichley kuch dinon se kabr se irfan kii awaazen sunai detii hai
 In which he says i am alive
 mujhe baahar nikaalo
 Irfan's younger brother Din Muhammad says that everything was fine for some time after death
 lekin ek rose jab vah kabr ke paas se guzara to use kabr se gunagunaane kii awaz sunai di
 At first he did not believe but when he reached the tomb, his senses flew away
 irfan acha khaasaa swasth noujvaan tha
 Along with his house, everyone was loved in the village too
 lekin achaanak use khun kii ultiyaan aana shuru huin or uski haalat bigadati chali gai
 Irfan died on 25 February
 irfan kii achaanak maut se gaanv vaale sakate main hai
 They believe that this is not a normal death, but something that is buried behind the curtain of mystery
 do gaz zamin ke neeche dafn ho chuke 32 saal ke irafaan ko gane kaa bahut shauk tha
 And he was dear to everyone
 ek din achaanak uski tabiyat bigadane lagi
 The family members showed him to doctors at many places
 magar uski haalat main koi sudhaar nahin hua
 After this, Irfan started having blood vomiting
 sari koshishen dhari kii dhari rah gayi or irfan chal basaa
 The villagers did not see Irfan's death as natural
 lekin buudhe pita sabiruddin ne kaleze par pathar rakh kar bete ko do gaz zamin ke neeche dafn kar diya
 For the people of the village, Irfan's death was nothing short of a shock and he was also afraid of something untoward
 logon kaa dar us vakt khauf main badal gaya jab kabr se gunagunaane kii baat unhen pataa chali
 Different thoughts started coming in the mind
 pita sabiruddin ke liye jawan bete kii maut kaa gam kisi pahaad se kam nahin tha or ab kabr se sunai dene vaali uski awaazen buree tarah tod rahi hai
 Now Irfan's family wants the administration to help him so that he can dig the grave and bring out the truth of his son

 Breathing stops for a while as the school children are crossing the swollen Mandakini river via trolley near Vijayanagar town of Kedar valley in Uttarakhand
 trollies main savaar bacchon kii bhi or apni baari kaa intjaar kar rahe bacchon kii bhi, jab tak ki ve sakushal us paar nahin pahunch jate
 And it is not a matter of any one day
 kareeb 200 bacchon ko rojaanaa isi tarah nadi paar kerani padati he
 Actually, even after five years of Uttarakhand disaster, the bridge has not been constructed here yet
 yahaan mandakini nadi ke paar badma or chilargarh pattee ke do darjan se zyada gaanvon ke bacchon ko padhai karne vijaynagar aana padataa he
 The non-construction of the bridge has directly affected the people of Chaka, Phalati, Badma and Silgarh belt at the other end of Agastyamuni, as well as three dozen villages in Agastyamuni block
 khaskar, schuli bacchon ko jaan jokhim main daalkar trollies se nadi paar kerani padati he
 Trouble does not end here
 chaaka gaanv ke jagmohan bataate hai, ''chaaka ke jis chor par trollies lagi he, vahaan tak pahunchane kaa rasta bhi najuk haalat main he
 It spoils in a little rain and has to travel long enough to reach here

 aapadaa main janapad ke 22 chote-bade pul dhwast ho gaye the, jo ghati ke kai gaanvon ko ek-duusare se jodate the
 Some of these bridges were built, but the Jhula bridge connecting Rail village near Phata, Jhula bridge near Vijayanagar and Dharkot has not been built yet
 vijaynagar ke raste jakholi or basukedaar kshetra ke kai gaanvon ke log rojaanaa aate-jate hai
 Everyday goods are also carried in this way

 At the same time, the villagers have to cross Halara Gadera and Purti Nallah to reach Osla Gangad from Mori's Sankari

 In 2014, a woman was swept away in the upheaval of Gadera in Halara Gadera
 2016 main yahaan ek brahmad brij bhi banaaya gaya tha, jo tut gaya
 Now the villagers in Halara Gadera and Purti nalas have made temporary culverts to run the work

 In 2017, a trolley was installed here but its wires were loose
 isi ghati main prasiddh paryatak sthal dodital jane ke liye bevara nadi paar kerani padati he
 Here also the villagers built a temporary culvert, which flows in the rainy season

 So now when it has been reported that unemployment is at its highest, it will not make any difference
 na sarkaar ko, na berojgaar ko
 Any sensitive government will surely be worried by these figures, but it will not come under pressure that the question of employment can pose a political threat to it
 pehle ke chunaavon main bhi berojgaare ke baad bhi raajnneetik dalon ne jeet hasil kii he lekin is baar jab berojgaare ricard str par thi tab kaha ja rahaa tha ki isse vyavastha par dabaav banegaa or sattadhari dal bijepi mushkil main aa sakati he
 But the unemployed have rejected the question of their unemployment and have given strength to the BJP
 is myne main bijepi kii kamyaabi kai myanon main raajnneetik rup se shreshth he
 It is not normal to build and maintain confidence in an unemployed person
 bijepi ko iskaa shrey milanaa hi chahie
 If the class that could have been against you became your supporter, then the BJP and its leadership should understand the potential of Prime Minister Modi
 congress kaa yakeen galat niklaa ki berojgaare kaa mudda use raajnneetik kamyaabi de saktaa he
 Rahul Gandhi promised to fill 4 lakh center jobs in a year, that too was rejected by the unemployed
 berojgaaron ko bhi shrey dena chahie ki unhone rashtrawaad kaa saath diya
 Not your stomach's questions
 yah bahut badi baat he
 No one can bet their jobs on one day, the unemployed put their future at stake
 phir bhi berojgaaron ko kisaanon se siikhnaa chahie
 Should also learn from traders
 saath saal ke vyapaariyon ke liye 3000 pension kii vyavastha bani he
 It would not be said from the claim that the traders would not have agitated for this, but it is definitely more than that the youth had agitated for their jobs
 har rajya main laathiyaan khai thim
 The farmers also supported nationalism but did not give up their issue
 andolan kiya or sarkaar par ant ant tak dabaav banaae rakhaa
 The result was meaningful
 modi sarkaar ke pehle hi faisle main sabhi kisaanon ko 6000 salanaa kaa piem sammaan mil gaya
 60 year farmers also got 3000 monthly pension
 berojgaaron ko vah report mili ki 45 saal main berojgaare sabase adhik he jiskaa koi matlab nahin he
 The unemployed openly told reporters from Delhi that unemployment is not an issue
 desh kii suraksha mudda he
 Hence BJP and Prime Minister Modi did not make any firm promises regarding their employment
 rojgaar par mukhya rup se bhaashan tak nahin diya
 i do not believe that the youth will not get anything like farmers and traders
 sarkaar ke saamne arthvyavastha ek chunauti ban gai he
 The government will deal with these challenges only for the youth
 sankat kaa charan hota he
 There will also be a phase of boom in the economy
 yuvaaon ko niraash hone kii zarurat nahin he
 It is possible that in the coming days, the government should bring some schemes for them as well
 jab main naukari siries kar rahaa tha or band kar rahaa tha tab bhi kai baar likhaa ki har pariksha kii alag-alag ladaai ladanaa or jeetna sambhav nahin he
 i told the youth of all the examinations of all the states to fight with each other by holding hands
 ek vyavastha ke liye ladiye taaki iskaa samaadhaan sabake liye ho
 Even after this, students keep messaging for different exams
 ab jab naukari series band kar di he tab bhi massej aae ja rahe hai
 Messaging is not the solution
 pareshaani sahi he lekin maang main dam nahin he
 But i am sure of this too ab sarkarein pariksha aayogon ko thik karengi
 If all the candidates come together and fight, it will speed up
 varna mujhe massej karne yaa dharna pradarshan kii khabaron ko sthaneey akhbaaron main dekhne se kuch nahin hoga
 Youth have to rise above their selfishness
 jaise ve rashtrawaad ke liye upar uthe
 An honest examination has to be demanded
 wo maang tab bhi kerani hogi jab aap sidhe prabhavit na hon
 It would not work if your admit card did not come, then started the movement
 maine isiilie naukari series band kar di he kyonki mul sawaal ek hi he
 Not a day i have done this series for one and a half years
 ye baat aaj nahin pehle ke kai lekh main likh chukaa hum
 Demand that there be an honest examination system in the country
 sabhi parikshaon ke yuvaaon ko aapas main milakar sarkaar se nivedan karnaa chahie ki vah unhen ek eemaandaar pariksha pranali de
 It should have a solid calendar
 aaj ek pariksha or kal duusari pariksha ko lekar whatsap andolan karne se kuch nahin hoga
 i will also see some other more effective format, by which i will think if this problem is exposed to the government
 philhal nazar nahin aa rahaa he isliye naukari series band
 Death of thousands of migratory birds in Jaipur's Sambhar lake, CM Gehlot quoting the report of the government lab of Bareilly, Ashok Gehlot government in Rajasthan has confirmed that thousands of migratory birds died in Jaipur's Sambhar lake due to 'botulism' happened
 mukhyamantri ashok gahalot ke mutabik bareli sthit sarkari lab kii report main pravasi pakshiyon kii mauton kii vajah botulism bataaya gaya he
 Earlier reports from Bikaner also cited botulism as a possible cause for such large scale deaths of birds
 sambar jhil jaipur se 60 kilomir kii duuri par sthit he
 What is botulism? It is a kind of keyfood poisoning that occurs when the botulin enters the body
 ye central nervas system (CNS) ko prabhavit karti he
 What did the Chief Minister say? Chief Minister Gehlot said, "the impact of the steps taken by the government is being seen
 bikaner main hamaare institute ne beemaari kaa naam botulism bataaya tha
 Recent information from Bareilly's government lab has also confirmed the deaths of birds from the same disease
 sawaal ye he ki bhavishya main bhi jaanch jari rahani chahie
 i have also written to Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar
 ”unhone kaha, 'main bharat sarkaar ke sachiv se bhi aagrah karuunga ki wo yahaan aaen
 The first scientists came here and they took samples
 ye kaam nahin karne vaala he
 
 
 There should be research
 mauton ke peeche kaaran kya he? mautein shuru hone ke peeche kaaran kya hai? ye sab jaanane ke baad ham sunishchit karnaa chahenge ki bhavishya main aisa naa ho?”bataa den ki sambar jhil main 15,000 se adhik pravasi pakshi mrit paae gaye
 Every year thousands of migratory birds make this world famous lake their natural destination in winter
 haalanki is baar hazaron kilometre dur se aae pravasi pakshiyon main se badi sankhya ke liye ye jhil maut kii jhil ban gai
 bjp's newly elected MP Gautam Gambhir had condemned the alleged beating of a Muslim youth by some youths in Gurugram, adjacent to Delhi, for allegedly beating up the slogan of 'jai Shri Ram'
 cricketer se rajaneta bane gautam gambhir ne loksabhaa chunaav main purvi dilli se jeet darj he
 He termed the incident as 'abusive' in his tweet
 vahiin bhaajapa netaaon ne gautam gambhir ke twit par kaha ki unka bayaan maasoomiyat main diya gaya he
 Along with this, a section of the party expressed disappointment over his tweet saying that the words of the young leader can be used against the BJP
 “in Gurugram Muslim man told to remove skullcap,chant Jai Shri Ram”
 It is deplorable
 Exemplary action needed by Gurugram authorities
 We are a secular nation where @javedakhtarjadu writes "O Palan Hare, Nirgun Aur Nyare" & @rakeyshommehra gave us d song "applications" in Delhi 6
 gautam gambhir ke twit ke baad dilli bhaajapa pramukh manoj tiwari ne bhi is ghatana kii ninda kii he
 Along with this, on Gautam Gambhir's tweet, he said that people should be cautious while reacting to such incidents
 unhone kaha ki kuch logon ne ek sajeesh ke tahat afvaahen failaane or muslimon main bhay kii bhaavana paidaa karne ke liye aisi ghatnaon ko anjaam diya he
 Tiwari said in his statement, "people need to be vigilant so that they are not misled by such rumors
" purvi dilli ke saansad gautam gambhir ne is maamle par maasoomiyat ke saath pratikriya di he
 After Tiwari, a senior Delhi BJP leader said, "gambhir is no longer a cricketer and he should feel that his words and actions will be seen through the prism of politics
" ' unhone kaha, "aisi ghatnaon ko koi bhi pasand nahin karata he, lekin haryana kii ek ghatana par tippanee karne kaa kya phayda he, jo bhaajapa ke khilaaf anya dalon dwaara istemaal kii ja sakati he
 After this tweet by Gautam Gambhir, many people on social media responded to him and said that he should not reveal only some selective cases
 My thoughts on secularism emanate from honourable PM Mr Modi's mantra “sabakaa saath, sabakaa vikaas, sab kaa vishwaas”
 i am not limiting myself to Gurugram incident alone, any oppression based on caste / religion is deplorable
 Tolerance & inclusive growth is what idea of India is based on
 The 25-year-old Mohammed Barkat Alam, a victim of the incident in Gurgaon, said that he was returning from Namaz on Saturday evening when he was surrounded by a gang of four to five people
 unamem se ek ne uske sir par chaaku se waar kiya or "jai shri ram" kaa naaraa lagane ko kaha
 When i refused to raise slogans, they started fighting
 gambhir ne ek anya twit main kaha 'pradhanmantri narendra modi ke 'sabakaa saath, sabakaa vikaas, sabakaa vishwaas' ke darshan se dharmanirpekshata main unka vishwaas badha he
 And any oppression based on caste and religion is disgusting '
 gudgaanv police ne cese darj liya he
 Police are also taking CCTV footage to identify the culprits

 Parliament's Information and Technology Standing Committee has asked the film's director Sanjay Leela Bhansali to appear before the committee on the Padmavati film controversy
 gat 17 navambar ko kamity kii pichhali baithak main zyaadaatar sadasyon ne yah raay rakhi thi ki kamity ko film industry ke saamne aane vaali samasyaon or chunautiyon par vichaar ke liye is industry ke logon ko bulaakar baat kerani chahie
 In view of the manner in which the film industry had expressed its displeasure after the controversy over the Padmavati film, the chairman of the committee Anurag Thakur decided to first call Sanjay Leela Bhansali, the director of the Padmavati film
 kamity ne sanjay lila bhansaali ko pesh hone ke liye unase phone par or unke ofis main sampark kiya he
 However, Sanjay Leela Bhansali has not been contacted yet, but the committee has messaged his office
 cameti chaahati hai ki bhansaali 30 navambar ko cameti ke saamne aaen or padmavati film vivaad par apni baat ko rakhen
 It is worth mentioning that under the Information and Technology Standing Committee, the Ministry of Information Technology, Information Broadcasting, Telecom comes
 sansad kii standing petishan ne bhi padmavati film vivaad par 30 navambar ko sibiefasi or soochna prasaaran mantralay ke adhikariyon ko saman kiya he, yah jaanane ke liye ki abhi tak unhone padmavati film vivaad par kya kiya he
 What is the objection in showing the film if nothing is wrong: Giriraj Singh: Union Minister Giriraj Singh said that if there is nothing wrong in the Padmavati film then what is the objection in showing it to the people who object
 unhone kaha, 'sanjay lila bhansaali ne kuch logon ko special screening karai thi, jinhone unki film kii taareef kii thi, lekin unhone abhi tak un logon ko film nahin dikhaai he, jinhen film kishooting kepahale din se hi aapatti he
 Today, not only the Karni Sena or the Rajput society has objections to Padmavati, but the nation has objections, because Padmavati is the pride of the national devotees of the country and they did not do Jauhar alone
 agar koi kisi dharm, itihaas or vyakti vishesh par film banaata he to use isaki ijazat pehle leni chahie
 No one will be allowed to tamper with history and religion in this country
 nitish kumaar ke endie ke kheme main aane ko 2019 chunaav se pehle modi-shah kii jodi kii badi safalataa maani ja rahi he
 On the one hand, while the most credible face of the opposition has come into its favor, the idea of forming a National Grand Alliance to challenge Modi seems to be failing
 or majboot hue modi or bhaajapanithish kii endie main vaapasi se desh main uttar, pashchim or purv main har taraf bhaajapa kaa aadhaar majboot hone ke saath pradhanmantri narendra modi ke 2019 main satta main vaapasi karne kii sambhaavna pehle se adhik prabal hoti dikhaayi pad rahi he
 With the jdu's Nitish Kumar coming to Bihar, the BJP and its allies have ruled over 70 percent of the country's population and the saffron party's impression has reached almost all parts of the country

 The BJP gained power in several states over the years, moving from Kamrup to Kutch and Kashmir to Kanyakumari on its mission

 Encouraged by Nitish's coming together, a BJP leader said, 'who will be the face of the opposition in 2019? Akhilesh Yadav, Mayawati, Mamta Banerjee, Lalu Prasad? None of these can surround us on corruption and good governance

 mumbai kii ore se cricket khel chuke or ranjai trophy main sabase zyada ran banane vaale amol majumdaar ne cricket ko alavida kah diya he
 Amol would have turned 40 on the 11th of the following month and before he retired from cricket
 majumdaar ne apni jindagi ke 21 saal cricket ko die or is dauraan kai uplabdhiyaan bhi hasil kin
 Although this batsman could never play international cricket
 lekin sachin tendulkar, rahul dravid or saurav ganguli jaise diggaj cricketron ke saath ye cricketer khel chukaa he
 10 interesting things about Majumdar's cricketing career - Majumdar started his domestic career in 1993-94 from Mumbai

 bahut kam logon ko pataa hoga ki jab sachin tendulkar or vinod kambli ne sharadashram skool kii taraf se 664 ran kii world record saajhedaari nibhaai thi, tab majumdaar pad pahanakar apni baari kaa intjaar kar rahe the
 He was made the vice-captain of the India Under-19 team in 1994 and also played for India a along with Sourav Ganguly and Rahul Dravid

 Our habit of looking at country and politics in the mirror of the present has become something that we consider immediate success-failure almost permanent and evaluate leaders or parties on the same basis - our future as a country Too
 yah sach he ki 2014 or 2019 ke aam chunaav main rahul gandhi or congress buree tarah parajeet hue hai
 In the mirror of the historic victory of Narendra Modi and BJP, this defeat seems to be something big and sad
 lekin ateet main dekhen to aise iktarfa parinaam or anumaan congress or BJP donon ke haq main aate rahe hai or donon ko hansaate-rulaate rahe hai
 In 1984, when Rajiv Gandhi had got more than 400 seats and atal-advani was just 2, some people felt that now BJP has been wiped out
 lekin 1989 aate-aate BJP veepi singh kii satta kaa ek paaya bani hui thi
 It emerged as the single largest party in 1996, formed a coalition government in 1998 and 1999, and by 2003, it seemed to be completely invincible
 lekin 2004 main sonia or rahul kii team ne phir se itihaas kaa chakkaa ulat diya
 Even in 2009, the cycle of politics turned in favor of Sonia and Rahul
 tasviir 2014 se badali
 But do not just hurry to accept these six years as the eternal truth of Indian politics, then you will find that Indian politics, Indian democracy and society have proved to be bigger than the resultant electoral politics - both in their stagnation and also in their changes
 darasal, bhartiya raajnneeti or samaaj main do-teen vaicharik dharaaen hameshaa se chalati rahi hai
 The revolutionary movement during the freedom struggle also appears to be more Hinduist in Maharashtra and Gujarat, while the revolutionary ganga-jamuni Tehzeeb from the north Indian belt appears to be in the rescue
 isi tarah congress bilkul shuruyaat main kisi hinduvadi dabaav se muqt nazar aati he, bich ke daur main hinduvadi prabhaav uske bheetar badhata dikhataa he or gandhi or nehru congress ke bheetar is prabhaav se lagaataar ladate or usko nirmul karte nazar aate hai
 Since the Congress is representing a large part of the country at that time, the debates of the Congress are scattered and become the debates of the rest of the country
 lekin is sahishnu samaveshi bharat ke samaantar raajnneeti ke dabaav main do or dharaaen viksit ho rahi hai, jo apni-apni tarah kaa raashtra chaah or maang rahi hai

 bharat kii azaadi ek tarah se bharat ke sapane ko kuchalati hui aati he or phir ek samaveshi bharat ke saamne khud ko bachaane kii chunauti rakhti he
 At this juncture, the Indian democracy - which despite widespread illiteracy, universal adult suffrage, and India's social divide - was viewed by the world with suspicion, it saves this nation
 bharat kaa voter antat apane bhatkaavon ke baavjood apane desh ko bachaa laata he
 In independent India, this voter is a victim of disillusionment, tries to dream new dreams again and again
 nehru or congress kaa daur chal hi rahaa he ki samaajawaadee raajnneeti kii ek prabal dhara ek vikalp kii tarah khadi hoti dikhaai padati he
 By 1967, it seems that the Congress has become past
 yah prayog fail hota he, congress phir lautati he or 1977 main phir jaise kabhi na lautne ke liye chali jaati he, lekin jai prakaash narayan ke netritv main hasil duusari azaadi mahaj teen saal ke bheetar pit jaati he or indira gandhi or congress kii vaapasi hoti he
 The purpose of remembering this history is simply to remind that two elections are nothing in a democracy
 yah bhi ki ve desh ko is tarah nahin badal sakate ki uske gun-sutara hi badal jaaen
 Narendra Modi and the BJP will awaken the Hindutva clout, as much as they can in the name of cow protection, as much as they fear in a section, but eventually they will have to go

 Return to Rahul Gandhi
 vanshavaad ko lekar unki or unke parivaar kii badi aalochana hoti rahi he
 But look carefully, barring Sanjay gandhi-maneka Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi, no other member of the gandhi-nehru family got the benefit of this dynasty
 nehru ke nidhan ke baad indira gandhi ko kursi nahin mil gai thi
 Even after the sudden demise of Lal Bahadur Shastri, the formula which was drawn in the midst of the internal quarrels of the Congress organization, the power was given to the organization by considering Indira Gandhi as weak
 beshak, indira ke pradhanmantritv main desh ne sanjay gandhi or unki patni or BJP saansad menka gandhi kii zyadatiyaan dekhin
 Similarly, in 1984, Rajiv Gandhi also became Prime Minister only after two years of political experience, being of the nehru-gandhi family
 agle paanch saal main unako apni anubhavheenata kii kaasi keemat chukaani padi
 But the story of Sonia and Rahul is not the story of Rajiv and Sanjay

 Sonia returned after this, with the question of Bofors, and in the next few years, she gave new life to the Congress organization
 2004 main rahul beshak is lahar kii vajah se saansad bane, lekin agle kai saal tak unhone apane vansh kii dabangai nahin dikhaai
 His act of tearing the bill of tainted mps appears to be the only such act when he is seen questioning his Prime Minister in the role of an eminent Yuvraj, but before that sonia-rahul respects Manmohan Singh
 yahaan tak ki jab UPA main har sanghathan kii ansuni kar manmohan singh atami qaraar ke apane faisale par ade rahete hai or left samarthan waapas letaa he, tab bhi sonia-rahul apane pradhanmantri ke saath khadey rahete hai
 From this point of view, Rahul Gandhi has made his own path in politics very far
 naakaami ke sawaal par unke istife kaa phir bhi ek tark ho saktaa he, vanshavaad kaa aarope un par bas isliye lagaana uchit nahin ki vah gandhi-nehru parivaar se aate hai
 But the truth is that by resigning now, he will strengthen the BJP and push the Congress towards some further disintegration
 kyonki isamen shaq nahin ki yah congress ke kayantaran kii ghadi he, lekin is kayantaran ko kisi sampurna lakshya tak le jane kaa kaam jis dhuree se ho saktaa he, vah ab bhi rahul gandhi hai
 As far as the country is concerned, it seems to change with Modi, but it will not change
 desh ke azaad or udaar khyaal nagarikon ke liye beshak yah kuch sankat or tanaav kaa samay he, lekin yah biit jayega or antat ham phir usee bharat main laut jaaenge, jo ek saath ladata-jhagadata or phir bhi ek-duusare se bandhaa rahata he
