 gangrape kaa gunaah, apane-aap main kuch itnaa ghinauna or kachotanevaala he ki sunate hi man kadava ho jaataa he
 But if, somewhere, one gets to hear about more than 45 gang-rapes, then how much trouble and how it is, it is also difficult to tell
 indore ke nazadik kajaligarh ke qile se nikali haqiqat kuch aisi hi he
 Police hands here have reached a gang of robbers who gang-raped more than 45 girls in three years
 sunakar yakeen nahin hota, dekh kar ankhen dhokhaa kha jaati hai
 But what to do? This is true
 wo sach, wo jo indore ke is mashhoor kajaligarh qile se saamne aayaa he
 It has come to light that how the tourists kept coming to this fort for years and coming back silently as a victim of gang rape
 saamne aayaa he ki kis tarah qile kii daro-diwaar ke bich chupe insaaniyat ke lutere saalon-saal sailaaniyon ko apana shikaar banaate rahe or tamaam keemati chizon ke saath-saath ladakiyon kii asmat bhi lutate rahe
 And it has come to light that along with the robbery of Asmat, how these criminals of Kajaligarh continued to make MMS of gang rape victims and blackmail them through these MMS
 is tarah khulaa maamlakaligarh kii ye kaali kahani shaayad kabhi jamaane ke saamne nahin aati, agar police ke haath ye chhutbhaiye lutere naa lage hote
 But what came to these miscreants investigating a complaint of looting of Simrol police of Indore, a dreadful and shocking story came out
 ek aisi kahani jis par khud pulisavaalon ke liye bhi yakeen karnaa mushkil ho gaya
 Not only did these miscreants confess to looting, but also confessed that in the last few years they have gang-raped more than 45 girls who roam there along with looting in the fort of Kajaligarh
 ye koi maamuli kubulanamaa nahin tha
 So, the police, breathing a sigh of relief from the robbery detection, came on their own
 dhakad se dhakad pulisavaalon ke bhi hosh ud gaye
 They used to hide behind the ruins and say that the incident is not done, that even after being caught by the police, even the best miscreants are blown away
 to is baar in badmaashon ke hosh kuch aise ude ki unhone bilkul kisi tote kii tarah apane karatuuton kii kahani sunaani kerani shuru kar di
 And this was a crime, gang-raped over 45 girls
 darasal, ye gang kajaligarh kii sunsaan vaadiyon or kile ke khandhiron ke peeche chup kar saalon se lutpaat or gangrape kii in vaardaat ko anjaam de rahaa tha, lekin zyaadaatar maamalon main gangrape kaa shikaar honevaali ladkiyaan, unke dost yaa phir rishtedaar loklaj ke dar se police ke paas report likhavane hi nahin pahunche
 Now after this case of serial gangrape along with robbery has come to light, the police themselves do not understand that after all, if they continue to investigate the matter, then how to increase it
 kapade utarkar jangal main chhod dete thevo pehle gangrape karte
 And then create MMS
 or jab isse bhi man nahin bharta, to ladakiyon ke kapade tak utaar kar unhen jangal main bhatakane ke liye chhod dete
 It means to say that this fear and shock of gangrape would have followed girls so far
 ki koi kabhi police ke paas jane kii himmat nahin juta paatin
 And just by taking advantage of this method, they continued to play with girls for years
 or gangrape kii shikaar ladkiyaan chupchaap sabakuch sahati raheen
 After the gang of 4 miscreants was arrested, when the gangster Shriram opened his mouth, the police just kept on listening
 usne kaha ki wo naa sirf kajaligarh main ghoomane aanevaale sailaaniyon ko akelaa paakar unke saath lutpaat karte the, balki ladakiyon ke saath gangrape bhi unka pasandida shagal tha
 But their method of carrying out gang rape incident i
e
 their modus operandi was totally different
 kuch aisi ki vaardaat kaa shikaar hone ke baad ladkiyaan khud apane pairon par chal police ke paas pahunchane kii himmat hi nahin juta paati thi
 This was such a disgusting job - these miscreants often used to hunt down the same girls who used to come here with their husbands or boyfriends and used to go out in secluded places
 --donon ko akelaa paakar pehle to hathiyaaron kii nonk par badmaash unhen dhamkaate, unase marpet or lutpaat karte or phir ladke ko marpet kar qaabu karne ke baad uske saamne ladki se zyaadati karte the
 The special thing in this was that along with the gangrape, they used to make MMS in the objectionable condition of these couples and also threatened that if they made a mistake of going to the police, then they would get this MMAS They will spread the world and discredit them
 --bahut se maamalon main to is gang ke badmaashon ne ladakiyon ke saath zyaadati karne ke baad unke kapade tak nahin lautaae or badmaashon ke chale jane ke baad aisi ladakiyon ne aas-paas rahanevaale graminon se kapade maang kar pahane
 Not only this, along with gang rape and looting, he would break the SIM card of the couple in his hold by removing his SIM card in front of him, so that after his release from the clutches, he does not immediately talk to anyone for help
 Can do
 --or isamen kajaligarh qile ke sunsaan khandhar or yahaan ke ghaney jangalon kii oot in badmaashon ke liye chhipane kii jagah sabit hoti
 How the police's difficulty, investigation progressed, but now despite all this, the police do not understand how to carry forward the investigation of this dreadful story of serial gangrape, because the miscreants have their place
 lekin haqiqat yahi he ki in maamalon main ab tak police ke paas aisi ek bhi shikaayat nahin he, jise wo is gang kii is karatuut ke saath jod sake
 In such a situation, it is a big challenge before the police to punish these criminals of serial gangrape
 45 gangrape ke is maamle ko aage badhaane main
 Of course, the hands of the Indore Police are swollen, but the people of Indore know that the fort of Kajaligarh
 aisi vaardaat ke liye kitna badnaam ho chukaa he
 Now the police are definitely saying that there is not a single complaint of gang rape from Kajaligarh, but from the people's tongue to the blog, this infamous thing is with the Kajaligarh Fort
 badnaam hua kilaholkar raajaaon ke daur main bana kajaligarh kaa ye qila kisi khaas jang kaa gavaah bana yaa nahin, ye alag baat he
 But the ruined walls of the fort and surrounded by lush green valleys all around attracts tourists like a magnet even today
 qile ke saath hi bana bhagwaan shankar kaa mandir or paas hi bahata jharnaa isaki khubsuurati main chaar-chand lagaataa he
 But despite their natural beauty and the presence of the temple of God, these criminals of serial gangrape did not desist from their sins
 ab indore kii police is maamle main beshak koi khaas shikaayat nahin hone kii vajah se in badmaashon ko walk over dene kii taiyaari kar rahi ho, lekin duniya jaanati he ki kajaligarh ke aas-paas aise jurm aaj se nahin, balki saalon se hote rahe hai
 Moreover, if there is a mention of the beauty of Kajaligarh in many blogs and even articles, then there is a mention of such crimes happening here as negative aspects

 According to his tradition here, the first child is in the maiden, so in 1965 the wife moved to her maternal home in Karachi
 asif ke janm ke baad ve waapas bharat aa gayi, unhen hindustani naagarikta bhi mil gai
 But the son remained in Pakistan
 70 saal kii jaibunisha bataati hai ki jab mujhe bhartiya naagarikta mil gai to betaa pakistani kaise hua? Surprisingly, Asif himself never thought that he was a Pakistani

 Now suddenly he is labeled as Pakistani and there is a danger of being sent back
 haalanki asif kehete hai 'kuch bhi ho jaae pakistan nahin jaaoongaa

 That was revealed in 2012 when the father applied for his passport for Haj

 The stairs are closed
 unke upar usee rang kaa carpet bicha diya gaya he jis rang ke pathar hone chahie

 '' Prime Minister Narendra Modi and French President passed through about 40 ghats from Assi Ghat to Rajendra Prasad Ghat

 The Mumbai fire brigade is not serious about the fire audit even after the increase in fire incidents in Mumbai
 artiai kaaryakarta anil galgali ne mumbai kii fire audit hui buildingon kii jaankaree maangi thi
 The fire brigade is evasive in giving a clear and clear information about it
 anil galgali ne beete 13 april 2018 ko ise lekar shikaayat bhi kii thi
 This is being ignored by the Mumbai Fire Brigade
 anil galgali ne kaha ki fire audit kii jaankaree saarvajanik karnaa samay kii zarurat he or ise na bataakar fire brigade mumbaikar kii jaan se khel rahaa he
 RTI activist Anil Galgali gave information about total number of buildings under fire audit, type of building, name of ward, total number of fire audited buildings and number of non-fire audited buildings under RTI on 1 January 2018
 Was asked galgali kaa kahana he ki vibhageeya agnishman adhikari esady saavant ne jaanboojhkar jaankaree dene se taalamatol kiya
 Under the Maharashtra Fire Manager and Biosafety Measures Act Act 2006, the owner / resident / housing society of the building has fire audit license of their building through fire fighting machinery and register the report with the Mumbai fire team office or upload it on the website of Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation Is necessary
 lekin kitne report praapt hua or kitnon ne aplod kiya hai, isaki jaankaree nahin he
 Why are the fire crews not giving important information like fire audit while the designated officer is empowered to investigate the building within the extent of 34 fire stations in Mumbai? Asking this question, Anil Galgali has complained to the fire brigade about this evasion of Manpa Commissioner Ajoy Mehta
 mumbai main jab aag kii ghatana hoti hai tab agnishman dal dwaara fire audit kii ore barti laaparvaahee bhi utani hi jimmedaar hoti he, yah sabit ho chukaa he
 If sources of the Fire Brigade Department are to be believed, this information has not yet been made online for technical reasons, but information about their area is available in every fire office in Mumbai

 mangalvaar kaa din dilli ke logon ke liye baari pad saktaa he
 There is a huge sense that there may be a shortage of water in many areas of the capital
 vajah he dilli main pani ko saaf kar unhen supplai karne vaale do water treetment plant ko aanshik rup se band kar diya gaya he jisase pani kii supplai kai ilaakon main baadhit hone kii ashanka he
 This is a big setback for Arvind Kejriwal as soon as he forms the government
 pehle dilli vidhansabha chunaav main aam aadmi party kii karishmai jeet, uske baad ramlila maidan main shapath grahan kaa or phir dilliwaalon ke saamne 3 maheene tak har roj 666 litre muft pani dene kaa aitihaasik elaan
 The people of the capital who always craved water felt that their life would be prolonged with life-long water
 lekin dilli kii janata ke liye buree khabar he kyonki dilli ko pani supplai karne vaale water treetment plant main se 2, wazirabad water treetment plant or chandraval water treetment plant ko pani main pradooshan kii vajah se aanshik rup se band kar diya gaya he
 Following this decision of the Delhi Jal Board, there may be a huge water shortage in many areas of Delhi
 khaskar purvi dilli, uttar purvi dilli, puraani dilli or nai dilli main log pani ke liye pareshaan ho sakate hai
 These are the areas where water from Wazirabad plant is cleaned and supplied to homes
 dilli jal board ke is faisle se dilli ke prabhavit ilaakon main rahanevaale logon main pani ko lekar hadakamp much gaya he
 However, the new fledgling Kejriwal government has no stake behind the impact on water supply as the decision has been taken for some other reasons
 gauratlab he ki wazirabad water treetment plant kii kshamta 120 million galen prati din kii he, jabaki chandraval water treetment plant kii kshamta 90 million galen prati din kii he
 In both these water treatment plants, water is supplied from the Wazirabad barrage, but due to pollution in the water of Yamuna, which is collected in the Wazirabad barrage itself, the amount of ammonia has increased more than the normal level
 isi vajah se aanshik bandi kaa faisla liya gaya he kyonki pani main ammonia kii maatra swasthya ke liye hanikaarak sabit ho sakati he
 The partial closure of the Wazirabad water treatment plant is expected to reduce the supply of water in areas such as Yamuna Vihar, Bhajanpura, Shahdara, Dilshad Garden, Seelampur, Geeta Colony in North East Delhi
 jabaki chandraval water treetment plant kii kshamta prabhavit hone se chandani chowk, civil line, dariyaa ganj, nai dilli aria or aasapaas ke ilaakon main supplai main baadha aa sakati he
 The reason behind this potential water scarcity is that even Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, who claims to have done something different, cannot do anything
 ab ummid yahi he ki dilli kii jeevandaayini yamuna main ammonia kaa str jald se jald kam ho jisase prabhavit ilaakon main logon ko pine kaa saaf svachh pani muhaiyaa ho sake

 You have played a magical innings during your last several matches and i have also covered it
 aapako main tab se cover kar rahaa hum, jab aap under-19 ke liye khelte the
 Can you tell me how you consistently play so well and how it has become possible for you? Playing with freshness is very important
 aap jaise hi pareshaan honge, aapkaa parformens level girtaa jayega
 You do not have a chance to think about the pitch
 darasal maine yah sikh liya he ki kaise acha mood rakhaa ja saktaa he
 i play my heartbeat while playing daily
 agar yah jor se na dhadak rahaa hota he to main samaj jaataa hum ki main achche spes main hum or sahi nirnay le saktaa hum
 This is the way to start my own innings
 inings khatm ho jane ke baad mai dobaaraa apane mod main aa jaataa hum
 This is why all my previous innings start in the same way
 aapane kaha ki aap yah sab behad saadhaaran tareeke se kar lete hai
 it's quite good
 maine is intervyuu ko karne se pehle sachin tendulkar se poocha tha ki apaviraat kohlike bare main kya sochate hai? is par unka jawaab tha ki vah yah sab aasaani se kar lete hai
 But i want to ask that you scored a century against Gujarat
 dobaaraa phir is team ke viruddh 100 ran banaae
 As far as i remember you were also fielding in the cover
 kya aapaki jindagi in sari chizon par nirbhar karti he? koi kaise itnaa pashnet or kamited ho saktaa he?sabase jaruri baat he khel ko rispect dene kii
 Every ball i play gives me 120% on it
 yahaan tak ki test match main bhi agar 88waan over chal rahaa he to bhi main apana best dena chahta hum
 i remember the time when i was very young and was trying to get into international cricket
 aapako kabhi bhi yah nahin bhoolanaa chahie ki aap kahaan se aae hai
 This thing always remains somewhere in my mind
 ho saktaa he ki mere achche parformens kii vajah yahi ho
 As long as i am fit and fine, i will keep doing all these things
 aapane apni stregal kaa zikr kiya isliye main aapako thodaa peeche le jaaoongaa
 2011 / 12 Melbourne, Sydney 2011 / 12 and then Perth and then the 75 runs, followed by Adelaide where you scored 116 runs
 kya aap bataaenge ki sidney or perth ke bich main kya antar aayaa? mere hisaab se vah cricket ke viraat kohli kaa janm tha
 The star we see today and talk about has become much better now than Sydney and Melbourne? Those were very restless days because i did not play well against the West Indies
 us samay meri peeth main bhi kuch pareshaani thi or vah thik hone main samay le rahi thi
 i could not even go on a tour of England at that time because i was not playing well
 iske baad phir mujhe maukey milane shuru ho gaye
 i was trying to get my test career back on track again
 mujhe phir australia daure par bheja gaya
 Nothing special happened in Melbourne
 sidney bhi kuch thik nahin rahaa
 i could not believe myself
 lekin ab jab main peeche dekhtaa hum to paata hum ki jo hoga wo hokar rahegaa
 Some things come to you only when you want it with determination
 mujhe nahin pataa ki sidney ke baad mujhe kya hua
 i just used to tell myself that my name is 8 ODI centuries and i can play in this level
 darasal aap jab sochate hai ki koi aisi shakti he jo aapaki madad karegi or rasta dikhaaegi or vah mauka jab aata he to aapako hi use pakadana bhi hota he
 What is the relationship between Virat Kohli and run chase? See, i will tell you again that i have started believing more and more in my game
 jab aap international cricket main aate hai, tab bhi apni jameen khojate rahete hai
 At that time, you are still trying to understand your game
 aap ek team kaa hissaa hote hai jo gyaarah logon se bani hoti he
 i get the most happiness from victory and i have the most hunger in it
 ran chess karne ke bare main main itnaa jaanata hum ki mere saamne ek torget he agar ham use puraa karte hai to jeet milegi or usee pal kaa mujhe intjaar rahata he jise main apane timmets ke saath paanaa chahta hum
 Can you tell how you manage in pressure? jab aapane T20 match main australia ke khilaaf shandaar pari kheli thi or puraa desh sirf viraat, viraat or sirf viraat hi kah rahaa tha
 How do i deal with so many pressures at once? If i can tell honestly, i did not want to be averaged since childhood
 yahaan tak ki club cricket ke samay bhi sabase zyada number bananaa chahta tha
 Even then people used to call me aerogent
 main jis tarah apni baaten coach se kah letaa tha, vah bhi logon ko akharati thi
 But i am glad that i have not changed despite this
 sabase zyada jaruri hota he ki aap khud ko samajhen
 There is nothing that cannot be found
 ho saktaa he ki mere andar yah gun nechurali aa gaya ho lekin mampositive sochaneke liye taiyaar rahata hum
 Then no matter how much pressure is on me
 yah to vaaki kaaphi acha he
 You used the word aerogent
 mujhe yaad he ki dhaka ke ek match ke dauraan jab aapane 183 ran banaae
 At that time you gave autographs to your fans, attended the press conference
 mujhe us samay bhi lag rahaa tha ki yah ladkaa erogent to nahin hi ho saktaa he
 Let's talk all about you
 saurabh aksar aapkaa zikr karte hai ki aapane indian team main ek jajba bhar diya he
 
 
 Yes, the quality of captaincy has come to me naturally
 ho saktaa he ki shuruyaat main main khud ko sabit na paaya houn
 At first i could not handle different players but now the whole unit is running in the same direction
 chaahe vah fitness culture ho yaa nutrishan ho
 Every batsman is ever ready to play to win the country
 aapane dekha hoga ki ajinkya rehane ne dilli test match main do shatak lagaae
 He was not thinking about milestones but was looking at what the team wanted
 ye chijen usamen aa rahi hai
 i mean that we all know the fact that we have to win by any means
 is process main jo koi bhi aage rahegaa, uski parformens ko puraa team enjoy karegaa
 This is because we all know that we will give 120%
 ek captain ke rup main aap isse zyada kuch nahin chaah sakate hai
 As long as the team plays the match with passion and commitment, you will keep winning
 aapane fitness culture kii baat kii
 Can you elaborate on this? You have become the symbol of Indian man in many ways
 kya aap bataaenge ki aap apane sharir ko kaise mentin rakhte hai?pichley kuch maheene mere liye kaaphi badlaav vaale rahe
 The training i was doing earlier, i have started it again
 maine pichley saal ise srilanka test siries ke daure main siikhaa
 So all the credit for this goes to our trainer Shankar Basu
 vah mere saath RCB main bhi hai
 He is a man who knows even the smallest things about sports fitness
 vah bakhubi jaanate hai ki ek fast bowler ko kya chahie, kisi spinner kii kya jarurat he, wicket keeper ko kis cheez kii jarurat hoti he or ek batsman kii jarurat kya he? unhen har cheez ke bare main acchhee jaankaree he
 They have taken me so far, i cannot even think of going
 ek samay tha jab main ded lifts main ek nishchit bhaar ko nahin uthaa paata tha lekin main ab aisa kar letaa hum
 He taught me to be patient
 is cheez ne mujhe kaaphi badal diya
 Now i feel energy in myself even in fatigue
 yah sab diet or training kii vajah se hua he
 My next question is whether this type of training will help you to play in 40-45 degree heat
 aisi sthiti main jab ham sirf 30 minute ke liye bhi baahar khadey hote hai to takalif hone lagati he
 Especially for people like you who score 100 in so much heat
 gujarat ko hi len, jahaan aapane 6,6,4,6,6 jaise karname kiye
 Actually none of us expected such a good score
 yahaan tak ki maine bhi nahin
 Where does so much strength come from you? To be honest, it all depends on your preparation
 yahi tarika he cricket jaise khel ko khilne ke liye
 Motivation for me is how quickly i can reach 0 to 100
 isliye mujhe us tarah training bhi kerani hoti he
 Even my cardio session is high intensity
 hai altitude ke mask pahan kar training hoti he jahaan aap thik se saans bhi nahin le pate hai
 You have to enlarge your lungs
 main aisi hi sari practice karata hum
 These are all part of Intraval training
 yahi tarika hota he jaanane kaa ki aapaki body field main kya chaahati he
 Therefore, it is a very easy calculation, but its understanding comes from awareness
 field par isaki sabase zyada jarurat hoti he or yah aapkaa saath ant tak nibhaati he
 How does it feel if you are compared with Sachin Tendulkar? Because of Sachin Tendulkar's biography writing, i know that the relationship between you and him is quite good
 aapaki or unki tulana har koi kar rahaa he
 Frankly, i feel very bad hearing this because it is not right for them
 sachin kii tulana kisi se bhi nahin kii ja sakati he, yah meraa apana vichaar he
 Actually this is not true because we compare batsmen of different caliber together
 meraa khelsaal dar salsudhar rahaa he lekin vah kuch aise hai jo ek acchhee quality ke saath paidaa hi hue the
 He maintained this thing for 24 consecutive years
 aisa karnaa majaak nahin he
 Right now i have been performing well for two or three years, so comparing so soon is not justified anywhere
 main jab bhi unke bare main sochataa hum to prabhavit hota hum lekin main sirf main hi rahanaa chahta hum jo ki sachin kii prerana se hi he
 Actually Sachin is one from whom we have learned a lot
 to seekhney vaale or sikhaane vaale kii tulana ek hi shrenee main rakhkar nahin kii ja sakati he
 Sachin is two levels above the number of players playing in this generation
 aap 100 shatak se kaise kisi kii tulana kar sakate hai
 Whenever he scored 100, people expected more from him
 
 You also say very good things and your words are also very cautious
 lekin kya aap apane agreshan ke bare main kuch bataaenge?aap sahi kar rahe hai
 i mean this is something i am born with
 mere pitaaji liyo the isliye main samaj saktaa hum ki yah agreshan kahaan se aata he
 i am a Scorpio myself
 is jodiek ke sin kaaphi hathi hone or apane baton ko majbootee se rakhane kii ore ishaara karte hai
 Actually the migration comes from here
 main pehle bhi bataa chukaa hum ki yah hamaari family main hi he
 i admit that i have sometimes broken the boundaries of aggression
 lekin mujhe khushi he ki maine ingaltiyon se bahut kuch sikhaahai
 i learned this and knew what to do and what not to do
 lekin main kathin mehnat se kabhi nahin bhaaga hum
 i never changed my migration because of others
 haa, jab mujhe laga ki isaki jarurat he to maine aisa kiya kyonki mujhe laga ki isse bekaar main hi aapaki energy khatm hoti he jiskaa upyog main apane game main kar saktaa hum
 On the other hand, i always use it when the need for migration is for energy

 bhartiya cricket team jab agle saal england daure par jaaegi to captain mahendra singh dhoni sahit unke lagbhag sabhi saathiyon ke naam par ek record judega
 These players will play a series of five Test matches for the first time in their careers
 england agle saal july agast main paanch test maichon ke liye bhartiya team kii mejabani karegaa
 In the last few years, five Test matches have been included in the Ashes series between England and Australia, whereas India has not played any such series since 2002
 is tarah se yah dhoni ke liye bhi nayaa anubhav hoga jinhone ab tak 77 test match khel liye hai
 Not only this, Sachin Tendulkar, who is on the threshold of playing 200th Test, has played five matches series only three times in his 24-year career
 bharat ke vartmaan khilaadiyon main tendulkar ke alaava keval jahir khan or harbhajan singh ko paanch test maichon kii shrunkhlaa main khilne kaa anubhav hasil he

 India has got a chance to play a series of five Test matches 26 times so far and only five of them have won
 isliye yah kah sakate hai ki bhartiya team paanch maichon kii shrunkhlaa main acha pradarshan nahin kar paayi he
 India also played six such series in which the number of Test matches was six and the interesting fact is that India won four of these series
 yah alag baat he ki ye chaaron shrunkhlaayein (westeindies, australia, pakistan or england ke khilaaf) usne gharelu dharti par kheli thi

 The comments iske baad bhartiya team ne 1955-56 main newjiland ko 2-0 or 1961-62 main england ko bhi isi antar se haraaya tha
 Both these series were hosted by India
 england ne paanch test maichon kii shrunkhlaa ke liye aakhri baar bharat kii mejabani 1959 main kii thi

 In this way, it will also be a new experience for Dhoni who has played 77 Test matches so far
 yahi nahin 200waan test khilne kii dahalij par khadey sachin tendulkar ne apane 24 saal ke kariyar main keval teen baar paanch maichon kii shrunkhlaayein kheli hai
 Among the current players of India, apart from Tendulkar, only Zaheer Khan and Harbhajan Singh have experience of playing in a five-test series
 bharat ne aakhri baar paanch test maichon kii shrunkhlaa april 2002 main westeindies daure main kheli thi
 Apart from Tendulkar, Zaheer Khan and Harbhajan Singh also took part in that series, who can play for India right now
 harbhajan us shrunkhlaa ke keval teen maichon main khele the
 India have played a series of five Test matches only six times in the last three decades and lost all of them
 bharat ko ab tak kul 26 baar paanch test maichon kii shrunkhlaa khilne kaa mauka mila he or inamen se vah keval paanch main jeet darj kar paaya
 Therefore, it can be said that the Indian team has not done well in the five-match series
 bharat ne iske alaava chah aisi shrunkhlaayein kheli jinamein test maichon kii sankhya chah thi or dilachasp tathy yah he ki inamen se chaar shrunkhalaaon main bharat ne jeet darj kii

 bharat ne isse pehle wadekar kii aguwai main hi westeindies ko uski sarajameen par 1-0 se haraakar aitihaasik jeet darj kii thi

 Actually, Manoj raped his wife before marriage
 haalanki baad main kanoonee shikanje se bachane ke liye usne gaanvvaalon ke dabaav main shaadi kar lee thi
 While watching 'blue Film' during the rape, 'darinda', it is worth mentioning that another disgusting and shocking information about Manoj was revealed earlier
 poochtacha ke dauraan aaropee manoj kumaar ne bataaya ki vah bacchee se dushkarm ke dauraan ashleel film dekh rahaa tha
 Manoj himself confessed this during police interrogation
 manoj ke mobile kii jaanch ke baad pataa chalaa ki usamen 12 ashleel filmein thim
 During interrogation, he told the police that he was watching these films while being with the girl
 iske alaava laal bahadur shastri aspataal main dilli police ne aaropee manoj kaa medical chekup bhi karaayaa
 Manoj was physically and mentally examined in the rape case at the hospital
 saath hi test ke liye manoj kaa diene sample bhi liya gaya he
 According to the police, the 'doll' was abducted on 15 April and kept hostage without food and water for two days in a room on the ground floor of a house in Gandhi Nagar, East Delhi, the accused lived in the same room
 peedit bacchee kaa parivaar bhi usee imaarat main rahata he

 Although the Bihar assembly elections are still delayed, the leaders of the Ghatak Dal have come face-to-face in the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) for sharing the chief minister's post and seats
 endie main shaamil rashtriya lok samta party (araspi) ne party ke adhyaksh upendra kushvaha ko mukhyamantri pad kaa ummidavaar banane kii maang ko lekar prastaav paarit kiya he
 The LJP has started opposing the Manjhi faction giving tickets to six mlas

 unhone bataaya ki baithak main yah prastaav bhi paarit kiya gaya ki sitambar-oktober main hone vaale bihar vidhansabha chunaav main 243 vidhansabha siton main se party 67 siton par chunaav ladegi
 Here, LJP President Ram Vilas Paswan opened the front against the five mlas included in the Majhi faction
 paswaanne patna main kaha, 'narendra singh sahit paanch vidhayak avasarwaadi hai
 He has betrayed LJP
 hamaari party in netaaon ko endie kaa ummidavaar banaae jane kaa virodh karti he
 Here, on Paswan's statement, Manjhi retorted that Paswan did not have the responsibility of selecting candidates for constituents within the alliance
 endie main mukhyamantri pad ke ummidavaar ko lekar upje vivaad par bijepi ke varisht netaa or saansad ashvini choube ne spasht kaha ki mukhyamantri pad kaa ummidavaar bijepi kaa hoga
 The parliamentary board decides the chief ministerial candidate in the BJP

 Now the demand for RLSP may become a headache for the BJP
 endie ke ghatak dalon ke bich kichakich us samay shuru hui he, jab bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah ravivaar ko patna main hai or party ke varisht netaaon ke saath baithak kar bihar vidhansabha chunaav kii ranneeti taiyaar karne main jute hai
 -input IANS chhattisgarh ke kisaan mushkil se ugaae gaye tomaataron ko ek baar phir sadakon par phenkane ko majaboor hai
 The reason for this is that farmers are not able to get away from wages due to tomato production
 natijatan kisaan naa to tamaato todane ko taiyaar hai or naa hi use kheton se nikaal kar bichauliyon tak pahunchane ko
 The middlemen are buying tomatoes at a price of one to two rupees per kg
 rajya ke vibhinn ilaakon main yah tamaato bichauliye paanch se saat rupee prati kilo kii keemat par mandiyon tak pahunchaa rahe hai
 It is reaching about fifteen rupees per kilo from Tomatradas to the general customers
 rajya main tamaato kii paidaavaar ke liye durg, rajanandgaanv, bemetara, dhamtar, mahasamund, baalod, surajpur, jashpur or ambikapur jila prasiddh hai
 To enable tomato-growing farmers to get a fair price for their crop, Chief Minister Raman Singh had planned to set up an MOU from the Patanjali Institute to set up food processing in Rajnandgaon district, but the scheme fell prey to bureaucracy
 bina soche- vichaare afasaron ne us ilaake main food processing plant sthapit karne kaa road map taiyaar kiya, jo vivaadit he
 Most of the land in this area comes under the purview of private property, which the land owners are not willing to sell
 natijatan tamaato utpaadakon ko iskaa khamiyaja uthaanaa pad rahaa he
 80% of tomato growing farmers have stopped plucking tomatoes from their fields due to falling prices
 tamaato utpaadak kisaanon ne 1-2 rupee kilo tak tamaato bechney se inkaar karte hue unhen nasht karne kaa faisla kiya
 According to Ramchandra Sahu of Parsoli village in Dhamdha block, middlemen are barely willing to buy tomatoes for up to Rs 1-2 per kg, while spending so much on breaking tomatoes
 tamaato kii paidaavaar, buaai, mehnat or keet patangon se fasal ko bachaane ke liye us par laagat saadhe chaar rupee prati kilo se zyada he
 In such a situation, tomato production is a loss for them
 is kisaanon ne ab tamaato kii paidaavaar naa karne kaa faisla le liya he
 According to them, they are not even getting the cost price of tomatoes
 aise main unhen kisi duusari fasal kii hi paidaavaar kerani chahie
 Hundreds of farmers in the village of Toyra, Gadaghat, Ghasra, Jatgharra, Dani, Kanharpuri and Kokri have expressed their displeasure and decided to throw tomato consignment on the streets as a protest
 kisaanon ke mutabik ek ore unki laagat keemat bhi nahin nikal paa rahi he, jabaki duusari ore bichauliye or sabji ke thok vyapaaree 3 se 5 rupee prati kilo tak laabh arjeet kar rahe hai
 Let us tell you that a similar situation was created some time ago when farmers did not produce it due to falling tomato prices, as a result tomato prices had skyrocketed and tomatoes were sold from 90 to 100 rupees per kg
 chhattisgarh ke ek bade hisse main subjiyon kaa utpaadan jabardast hota he
 Due to cash crop, most farmers produce tomato crop on priority, but now farmers are scared about its yield
 unke mutabik tamaato utpaadan nuksaandaayak sabit ho rahaa he, duusari ore ise cold storage main rakhana sambhav nahin hota
 Not only this, no other product is made from tomatoes
 tomato kachap kaa utpaadan karne vaali ikaiyaan bhi rajya main nahin hai
 In such a situation there is not even a market to buy their crop, due to which most of the farmers are forced to throw their crop on the streets

 agar apana gaanv chalaane kii jimmedaari unako de di jaae, centre or rajya kii kuch policy main diarect agar janata kii bhagidaari ho jaae
 i think this will reduce the strength of the separatists in the country

 If we have invited them to fight the elections and without money, then they will not be able to stand there

While people are blaming the negligence of the administration for the devastation in Uttarakhand, the Garhwal residents of Uttarakhand believe that the outbreak of Mata Dhari Devi caused this great disaster

 This was done for Hydel-power project in Srinagar, Uttarakhand

 Ashok Singhal of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad said, 'people had demonstrated against the hydro power project and protested the removal of the statue of Dhari Devi
 lekin iske baavjood 16 june ko dhari devi kii pratimaa ko hataaya gaya
 The anger of Dhari Devi caused havoc in Kedarnath and other areas of Uttarakhand

 It is said that one Atom bomb is enough to destroy an entire breed and at present there are not one or two such 15493 Atom bombs in the whole world
 or ye ginati abhi or badhegi kyonki kai desh chori-chupe yaa khuleam ab bhi atom bam banane main lage hai
 The name of the top is North Korea
 vaise uri main army camp par hue aatankwaadi hamale ke baad jis tarah se bharat-pakistan ke bich tanaav bad rahaa he, use dekhte hue ye jaananaa jaruri he ki aakhir bharat or pakistan ke paas kitne parmaanu bam hai or kiskaa bam dur tak maar kar saktaa he
 Tension remains on the other side of the outskirts and beyond the outskirts
 ravivaar ko uri main sena ke camp par hue aatankwaadi hamale ke baad se har opshan khulaa hone kii baat kahi ja rahi he
 There is talk of retaliation, retaliation, killing with diplomacy, fighting politics, even fighting
 phir sabhi ko achaanak khyaal aata he ki hindustan or pakistan donon hi parmanu bamon se las desh hai
 What if nuclear war broke out in both of them? How many Atom bombs near indo-pak? At present, there are 15493 nuclear bombs in the whole world, which can kill from 13 thousand kilometers to 15 thousand kilometers
 jaankaron kii maane to inamen se aadhe parmaanu bam bhi istamail hue to duniya ke nakshe se duniya kaa namonishaan mit jayega
 At present, Russia has 7300 nuclear bombs, 7100 near the US, 300 near France, 260 near China, 215 near England, 120 near Pakistan, 110 near India, 80 near Israel and 8 nuclear near North Korea
 That is atom bomb
 bharat dur tak gira saktaa he atom bamsbase zyada parmaanu bam rakhane vaale rus ke paas hi sabase zyada duuri tak maar karne vaale bhi parmaanu bam hai
 Russia can attack from nuclear bombs from 11 thousand to 15 thousand kilometers
 jabaki america ke paas 9650 kilometre se lekar 13 hajaar kilometre kii duuri tak maar karne vaale parmaanu bam hai
 Pakistan may have ten nuclear bombs more than India, but as far as distance is concerned, Pakistan can drop bombs up to 1300 kilometers only, whereas India's firepower is high
 bharat do hajaar kilometre dur tak parmaanu bam barasaa saktaa he yani bharat ke parmaanu bam kii jad main kareeb-kareeb puraa pakistan aa jaataa he
 The new world of Atom bomb is already worried about nuclear bombs
 ab upar se uttar korea kaa sanakee taanashaah bhi is res main aisa kud padaa he ki bas ek ke baad ek pareekshan hi kiye ja rahaa he
 Equipped with eight nuclear bombs, North Korea has announced to manufacture 25 more such bombs within the next three months
 kuch ke to wo baqayada pareekshan bhi kar chukaa he
 The North Korean freak dictator has successfully tested the five Atom bombs, but still has not survived
 wo agle teen maheene main yani saal khatm hone se pehle-pehle 20 or atom bam bananaa chahta he
 And it is reported that he has also collected the necessary uranium for this
 ek atom bam ek puri nasl mitaane ke liye kaaphi he
 Now think about what they will do with the 25 Atom bombs? The trial of North Korea's cynical dictator Kim Jong Un in the last nine months has scared the whole world including the neighboring country of South Korea
 mulk kii sabase oonchi kursi par baithe sanakee taanashaah kim jong un ke ishare par is desh ke sciencedan jahaan ek ke baad ek parmaanu bam bana rahe hai, vahiin apane newclear centre par khuleam unka pareekshan bhi kar rahe hai
 And this is happening when almost the whole world including the US has ended all its relations with North Korea
 or inamen parmaanu takanic kii adla-badali se lekar duusare rishte bhi shaamil hai
 But despite this, North Korea has proved that by testing these bombs, it is also included in the world's atomic strength countries, while it has also shown that it is not in favor of any other country in dealing with its enemies
 chaunkaane vaala he nayaa khulassaalekin saal main sirf do parmaanu bamon kaa pareekshan hi jaise kaaphi nahin tha
 The new revelation about North Korea is even more shocking
 jaankaron kii maane to uttar korea 20 or parmaanu bam banane kii taiyaari kar rahaa he
 This country has set a target of three months for this
 wo parmaanu bam banane ke liye uranium pehle hi juta chukaa he
 While the technology to make atomic bombs is already there
 aise main is puure up mahadweep main tanaav kaa or badhanaa abhi tay he
 America has given a befitting reply; North Korea's antics can only be gauged from this matter
 dakshin korea ne jahaan ise pehle hi uksaanewaali karrwai qaraar diya he, vahiin dakshin korea ke aasmaan par apane fiter jet uda kar america ne bhi uttar korea ko ye sandesh dene kii koshish kii he ki agar wo dakshin korea samet duniya ko ankhen dikhaane kii koshish kar rahaa he, to use bhi isaki baari keemat chukaani pad sakati he
 Pakistan is helping in the meantime, many international sources have pointed towards Pakistan with uranium near North Korea
 inkaa kahana he ki ye pakistan hi he jo chori chhipe uttar korea ko uranium kii supplai kar paise kamaane main juta he
 And Pakistan is also selling uranium to North Korea, which it has acquired under a nuclear agreement with China
 vaise pakistan beshak in baton se inkaar kare, jaankaron kaa daawa he ki abhi haal ke saalon main uttar korea ke kai rajanayikon ne sirf uranium hasil karne ke liye hi pakistan kaa daura kiya tha
 North Korea heading towards disaster 
 dekhanevaale ise mulk ke sanakee taanashaah kim jong un ko khush karne kii koshish ke taur bhi dekh rahe hai
 But the way millions of people took out a rally after this second trial in North Korea's capital Pyongang to express their happiness, it has been proved that North Korean freak dictator Kim Jong Un, as well as the common people there Which are also moving towards catastrophe
 minuton main karodon kii aabaadi ho sakati he tabahbas isi se andaja laga lijie ki uski tabaahi kaa dayera kaisaa or kitna bada hoga? bas itnaa samaj lijie ki aisa bas ekahaidrogen babgar ek karod kii aabaadi vaale kisi bade shahar par gir jaae to us puure ke puure shahar ko shamshaan banane main ek minute se zyada vakt nahin lagegaa
 History is witness to the atomic bombings of Japan's two cities Haroshima and Nagasaki on August 6 and 9, 1945, which are still the dark pages of history, which make the memes stand out from memory
 tab mahaj do parmaanu bamon ne japan ke in do shaharon main sava do lakh se zyada logon kii jaan le lee thi
 Hydrogen bomb is the most dangerous weapon
 Now think of that hydrogen bomb which is hundred times more powerful than any such atomic bomb dropped on these two cities
 agar aisa koi bam kisi shahar par gira diya jaae, to anjaam kya hoga? bas, itnaa samaj lijie ki ek hidrogen bam karod-dedh karod kii aabaadi vaale kisi bhi shahar ko minuton main puri tarah se matiamet kar saktaa he
 And this is the reason that at this time, if there is one of the biggest items of destruction in the world, then it is the hydrogen bomb
 kya he hidrogen bam?darasal, ye ek kism kaa parmaanu bam hi he or isamen hydrogen kii tarah hi du tirium or tritirium jaise tatwon kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 The fuse of the atoms causes a detonation in the bomb and requires about 5 million degrees centigrade of heat
 or ye garmi suraj ke sabase zyada garm hisse bhi zyada garm he
 When the atomic bomb produces this heat, the hydrogen atom fuses and the heat it produces converts hydrogen into helium
 kai desh hidrogen bam se lasasaalon pehle 1922 main vaigyanikon ne hydrogen parmaanu ke dhamaake kii takat kaa pataa lagaaya tha
 This was followed by heavy hydrogen in 1932 named Deuterium and another heavy hydrogen in 1934 named Tritarium
 phir 1950 main america ke raashtrapati tru main ne hydrogen bam taiyaar karne kaa hukum diya
 Subsequently a large factory was started in South Carolina
 philhal america rus, china, france samet kai mulk hidrogen bam kii takat se las hai
 But the arrival of this bomb in the hands of North Korea's eccentric dictator is indeed a matter of concern for the world
 kai mulkon ne todaa nataahthiyaaron kii isi sanak ke chalate duniya ke kai mulkon ne uttar korea se sambandh khatm kar liye lekin kim jong nahin mana
 Countries like America, England, France tried to stop Kim Jong's intentions but that did not make any difference
 ulta ab isapareekshanke baad wo sidhe sidhe america ko chunauti de rahaa he
 However, in September last year, the Washington-based Institute for Science and International Security had expressed doubts about developing a dangerous weapon at North Korea's Yangon Nuclear Complex
 north korea ne hydrogen bam kaa kiya tha pareekshanthink tanks ne satellite images ke aadhaar par bataaya tha ki north korea ne hydrogen bam banane kii takanic bana lee he or 6 janvari ko sachmuch north korea ne hydrogen bam kaa pareekshan kar liya
 The cynical dictator of North Korea is not only making nuclear bombs, but he is also collecting all other dangerous weapons
 phir chaahe wo newclear missile ho yaa tano van vajani bam
 There are some weapons whose range is up to ten thousand kilometers

 Now the court will decide whether the society which runs this school can be considered as a state or its subsidiary under the Constitution and hence falls under the jurisdiction of the apex court and the High Court
 isse pehle, sarkaar ne sheersh adaalat se kaha tha ki kendra sarkaar ke samooh-e ke adhikariyon ke alaava anya sarkari karmchaariyon ke bacchon ko bhi 60 fisadi cote ke tahat pravesh diya ja saktaa he
 On November 6 last year, the High Court, in its decision repealing the 60% quota in the Sanskriti School, said that it is like separating whites and blacks from America at any time and thereby violating the equality and right of education provided in the Constitution
 it happens
 sheersh adaalat pichley saal 15 disambar ko ucch nyaayalay ke faisle ke khilaaf daayar apil par sunwaayee ke liye sahamat ho gai thi
 In this school, 60 per cent seats are reserved for the children of group-a officers, while 25 per cent seats are reserved for the economically weaker sections, ten per cent seats for the remaining societies and five per cent seats for the children of its employees
 tippaniyan The High Court said in its judgment that all the expert commissions have said that the existing schooling system in India and abroad is widening the gap between the affluent and disadvantaged sections
 ucch nyaayly ne samooh-e ke adhikariyon ke bacchon se kareeb 40 fisadi kam fees liye jane ke bare main khabaren saamne aane ke baad 2006 main swat: hi iskaa sangyaan liya tha
 Earlier, the government had told the apex court that apart from Central Government group-a officers, children of other government employees could also be given admission under 60 per cent quota
 ucch nyaayalay ne pichley saal chah november ko samskruti skool main 60 fisadi kota nirast karte huye apane faisle main kaha tha ki yah to america main kabhi gore or ashweton ko alag alag karne jaisaa hi he ore isse samvidhan main pradutt samta or shiksha ke adhikaar kaa hanan hota he
 The apex court had agreed to hear the appeal filed against the decision of the High Court on 15 December last year
 is skool main 60 fisadi siten samooh-e ke adhikariyon ke bacchon ke liye arakshit hai jabaki 25 fisadi siten aarthik rup se kamjor varg, das fisadi siten shesh sosayadi or paanch fisadi siten apane karmchaariyon ke bacchon ke liye arakshit hai
 The comments ucch nyaayalay ne apane faisle main kaha tha ki tamaam visheshgy aayogon ne kaha he ki bharat or videshon main maujuuda schuli vyavastha suvidha sampann or suvidhahin virgo ke bich khai chaudee kar rahaa he
 The High Court automatically took cognizance of this in 2006, after reports surfaced that about 40 per cent less fees were charged from children of group-a officers

 Good performance will be expected

 In the by-elections in Phulpur and Gorakhpur Lok Sabha seats of Uttar Pradesh, BJP has faced a crushing defeat
 pichley tees saal se yogi kii karmbhumi rahi gorakhpur main bijepi ummidavaar upendra shukla ko sapa ke praveen kumaar ne maat di
 bjp's Kaushalendra Patel was defeated by SP candidate Nagendra Patel badly in the by-election after winning Phulpur in the 2014 Modi wave for the first time since independence
 bataa den ki pichley saal mukhyamantri banane ke baad yogi adityanath ne gorakhpur loksabhaa or keshav prasad maury ne dipti siem banane ke baad istipha diya tha
 After which by-elections have taken place, on which the SP has managed to win with the support of the BSP
 upachunaav main bijepi ke haar ke paanch aise kaaran rahe hai, jinke chalate yogi or keshav kii sansadeey siten bijepi nahin bachaa saki
 5 reasons for bjp's defeat in the by-election - 1
 yogi-keshav ke bich adaavatsoobe main mukhyamantri yogi adityanath or dipti siem kii adaavat jagajaahir he
 The enmity between the two became the reason for bjp's defeat in the by-election
 yogi or keshav apane apane varchasv ko kaayam rakhane ke liye ek duusare kii sansadeey siton se bijepi ummidavaar kii haar ko dekhnaa chaahate the
 In view of this, the veteran leaders of both BJP did not work hard like 2014 Lok Sabha and 2017 Assembly Elections on each other's seat
 isi kaa khamiyaja bijepi ummidavaaron ko haar se chukaana padaa he
 2
 gorakhpur yogi kii naapsand, phulpur main bahrigorakhpur main bijepi ummidavaar upendra shukla ke bare main kaha jaataa he ki yogi kii marji ke khilaaf party ne utaara tha
 Yogi wanted Dharmendra Singh as the candidate for Upendra
 kaha jaataa he ki party ne shiv pratap shukla kii pasand ke upendra shukla ko maidan main utaara tha
 It is believed that Upendra Shukla has to pay for this as a defeat
 vahiin phulpur main bijepi pratyaashee kaushalendra patel kaa bahari hona baari padaa
 Kaushalendra Patel belongs to Chunar and has been practicing politics from Varanasi
 party ne unhen phulpur main patel bahul seat hone ke chalate maidan main utaara tha
 At the same time SP gave ticket to Nagendra Patel of Phulpur region
 bahari banaam kshetreey patel ke bich main nagendra kaushalendra par baari pade
 3
 vipaksh kii soshal ejineeringgorakhpur or phulpur upachunaav main bijepi ko maat dene ke liye sapa-basapa ne 23 saal puraani dushmani ko bhulaakar haath mila liya he
 Due to this, obc-dalit as well as Muslim voters stood united with the SP candidate in both the seats and did not have to go through a condition of Confusion
 jabaki bijepi upachunaav main soshal ejineering banane main safal nahin ho saki
 Like 1993, once again, the SP-BSP solidarity turned into a victory
 4 
 The question that has faded in a year, the question arises that the Modi wave of one year ago is now slowing down
 yogi ke saal ke shashan main aisi koi badi uplabdhi ginane ke liye bijepi ke paas nahin thi
 Modi and Yogi Haseen won the political battle of the state by showing dreams and promises
 us rang ab feekaa padane laga he
 The BJP has had to pay the same in Gorakhpur and Phulpur Lok Sabha by-elections
 5
 bjp's consecutive defeat in the by-elections: The BJP has continued to lose in the by-elections since 2014
 madhya pradesh ke ratlam-jhabua loksabhaa seat par hue chunaav se bijepi ko jo haar mili he, wo punjab ke gurudaspur, rajyasthaan ke ajmer, or alvar se hote hue upi ke phulpur or gorakhpur main bhi vaisaa hi nateeja dekhne ko mila
 Although the ruling party wins the by-election, it is reversing with the BJP

 British lawyer Jasbir Uppal became an active activist of civil liberties after learning the story of Sarabjit's plight in 2007
 uppal ne kaha ki pakistan kii jelon main aise bahut se bhartiya sad rahe hai jo antarrashtriya samudaay kii najar main nahin aae hai
 Many of these people are prisoners of war of 1971 war and have been suffering persistent torture ever since
 ye log pakistan kii kaid main jivan bitaane ko majaboor hai or unhen bharat kii taraf se apana haal poochne kaa koi sanket nahin mil rahaa
 In November 2012, Uppal granted a petition to the courts of Pakistan, the Geneva Office of the United Nations Human Rights Commissioner (OHCHR), Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and Salman Khurshid regarding Ram Das and Mangal Singh
 in donon bhartiya jasuson ko disambar 1971 main jail main daalaa gaya or ve ab bhi kot lakhapat jail main band hai
 Recently, in a memorandum to a joint committee of British mps on 7 March, he gave details of dozens of prisoners, whom the outside world has no knowledge of

 It is believed that the island of Messiah is an overseas prisoner camp where Pakistan sent many war prisoners in the mid-1970s
 inamen se kisi kaa bhi naam videsh mantralay kii 1971 main gaayab ho gaye 54 bhartiya sainikon kii suchi me shaamil nahin he
 Uppal says that she was stunned to learn how the Indian political system refuses to recognize its own citizens who are facing the plight

 chamel ke shav ko gat 15 march ko bharat ko saunp diya gaya, lekin jammu-kashmir main rahane vaale unke parivaar ko ab bhi postmortem report kii ek copy kaa intjaar he
 There are also indications of involvement of Kot Lakhpat Jail employees in the 26 April attack on Sarabjit

 But earlier some of the statements made by some jail staff, stated that the number of attackers was 'six', including two warden who have been suspended
 sarbajit kaa shokakul parivaar yah maanata he ki yah hamalaa kisi badi sajeesh kaa nateeja he jisamen jail ke sheersh adhikari bhi shaamil rahe hai
 "they had knives and rods," said Dalbir Kaur
 mujhe lagata he ki warden ne khud hi hamalaavaron ko mere bhai kii kothri kii chaabi de di thi
 "many former prisoners who have been sentenced in Kot Lakhpat Jail also say that it is impossible for anyone other than prison staff to reach a death sentence prisoner
 sarbajit ke parivaar kaa aarope he ki bharat sarkaar ne kuch khaas nahin kiya
 After returning to the Wagah border from Lahore on May 1, troubled and sad Dalbir Kaur told reporters, 'prime Minister Manmohan Singh should resign
 ’ saahani ne kaha ki bhartiya satta pratishthan ne pakistan main uske astitv ko nazarandaaj karne ke liye har sambhav prayaas kiya he
 He said, 'would you believe that during my 11 years in jail, not a single person came to meet the Embassy

 Union Rural Development Minister Jairam Ramesh said that Narendra Modi's comment on Lokayukta is the same as Asaram talks about celibacy
 jairam ramesh modi par puche gaye ek sawaal kaa jawaab de rahe the
 The question was related to Modi's criticism of Rahul Gandhi on the issue of Lokpal Bill at a rally in Uttarakhand on Sunday
 narendra modi ne sawaal kiya tha ki jo congress aaj sansad main lokapal vidheyak ko paarit karne ke liye aage aa rahi he, usne uttarakhand main lokayukta adhinium kyon nahin lagu kiya, jise bi
 C
 khanduri ke netritv vaali purv bijepi sarkaar ne banaaya tha
 Jairam said that Modi does not have the right to speak on the Lokpal Bill as he has not appointed Lokayukta in his state for 10 years
 ramesh ne kaha, 'jis vyakti ne 10 varshon se ek lokayukta nahin niyukt kiya, use lokayukta ke bare main baat nahin karnaa chahie
 He has not appointed Lokayukta for 10 years and he is preaching on Lokayukta
 ' jairam ramesh ne uttarakhand ke lokayukta adhinium ko ek majaak bataaya
 Significantly, the Uttarakhand Lokayukta Bill was unanimously passed in the state assembly in November 2011
 us samay khanduri ne rajya main duusari baar satta sanbhali thi
 The president gave his assent to the bill in September this year after two years of waiting, but the bill has not yet been implemented in Uttarakhand, as Chief Minister Vijay Bahuguna wants to implement it only after making some amendments

 ) If you or someone you know is looking for a groom, then tell them that their search can end by going to a fair
 jahaan par unako tarah-tarah ke duulhe dikhenge, jo unhen pasand ho ve chun sakate hai
 
 
 Yes, you must have heard about your cow-buffalo fair before, but the fair of the grooms is very shocking
 lekin yah sach he
 In the Mithilanchal region of Bihar, the 'sourath Sabha', or groom's fair, has been held since ancient times
 yah parampara aaj bhi kaayam he
 In the modern era, the debate about its importance has definitely intensified
 saurath sabha madhubani jile ke saurath naamak sthaan par 22 bigha jameen par lagati he
 It is also known as 'auditorium'
 saurath gujarat ke saurashtra se miltaa-julata naam he
 Like Saurashtra in Gujarat, there is a Somnath temple here, but not as big
 saurath or saurashtra main samya shodh kaa vishay he
 In the Mithilanchal region, this fair of Maithil Brahmin grooms takes place every year for seven to 11 days in the month of Jyeshtha or Ashadh, in which the father of the girls selects the worthy groom and takes them with them and then there is a saying of 'chut Mangni Pat Baivah'
 is sabha main yogya var apane pita va anya abhibhavakon ke saath aate hai
 People on the Virgo side interact with the warriors and their families, gather complete information about each other's family, clan-family and decide the relationship if the groom likes it
 sthaneey log bataate hai ki kareeb do dashak pehle tak saurath sabha main acchhee-khaasi bheed dikhti thi, par ab iskaa aakarshan kam hota dikh rahaa he
 Higher education brides do not like to sit in this haat
 is parampara kaa nirvaah karne ko aaj kaa yuva varg taiyaar nahin dikhataa
 The role of traditional registrars is important in Saurath Sabha
 yahaan jo rishta tay hota he, use manyata panjikar hi dete hai
 The role of the magistrate in the court marriage is the same role of the registrar in this assembly
 panjikar ke paas var or kanya paksh kii vanshavali rahati he
 They match the Uthedh (record of marriage) of the seven generations on either side
 donon pakshon ke utedh dekhne par jab pushti ho jaati he ki donon pariwaron ke bich saat pidiyon main isse pehle koi vaivaahik sambandh nahin hua he, tab panjikar kehete hai, 'adhikaar hoie!' yani pehle se rakt sambandh nahin he, isliye rishta pakkaa karne main koi harj nahin
 Vishwamohan Chandra Mishra, the registrar who arranged marriages in Saurath, states, "the Maithil Brahmins started this practice some 700 years ago in 1310, so that marriage relations could be decided between good clans
 san 1971 main yahaan kareeb dedh lakh log aae the
 Even in 1991, about fifty thousand people came, but now the number of visitors has come down considerably

 He has started a 'chalu Saurath Sabha' campaign on behalf of his organization
 unhone kaha ki is tarah ke meley ke peeche kuch vaigyanik kaaran bhi hai
 Doctors do not even recommend getting married in the same blood group
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki maithil brahman ek hi gotra va mul main shaadi nahin karte
 They believe that by marrying in a separate gotra, children have the best quality

 apni kanya ke liye suyogy duulhaa khojna kathin kaary tha, isliye mithilanchal ke sabhi brahman saurath sabha main aakar shaadi tay karte the
 He said that now people here have started living in other states too and they get eligible brides there too

 The purpose of the Saurath Sabha was to prevent consanguineous marriages, abolition of dowry, and acceptance of matrimonial relations keeping in mind all aspects of the bride and groom to maintain social purity of the relationship
 " He said that the positive result of this tradition was that the marriage institution in Mithila was always in a strong position and there was a deepening in social relations

 jha kaa kahana he ki yah aitihaasik sthal paryaton vibhaag or prashasnic upeksha kaa shikaar he
 Insisting on its reconstruction, he has demanded the Government of Bihar to construct a community building at the Saurath Sabha site, so that it can have a permanent identity and through this, the dowry-free marriage in Mithilanchal can be taken forward as a campaign
 
 sthaneey gramin vaibhav mishra kehete hai ki yah sach he ki is sabha se ab logon kaa mohabhang hota ja rahaa he
 The main reason for this is the neglectful policy of the government
 unhone kaha ki saurath sabha ko ab pehle jaisi suvidhaayen, jaise yatayaat, pani or bijli aadi nahin di jaati
 The comments mishra ko is baat kaa bhi malaal he ki ab bade dhani brahman yahaan nahin aate

 Many of Gandhi's fans have received the Nobel Prize for Peace, in which US President Barack Obama has just received it, but the biggest question remains that even today, despite being nominated five times, this award is a symbol of non-violence and peace
 Why did Mahatma Gandhi not get it? There was selection for Nobel 5 times, although three times Gandhiji's name was selected but each time the selection committee They did not let him get this award, citing different reasons
 chayan samitiyon ne gandhi ji ko nobel na milane ke kai kaaran bataae jaise ki vah atyadhik bhartiya rashtravaadi the or vah baar-baar isa (shanti doot) ke rup main saamne aate the lekin achaanak se saadhaaran raajnneetijna ban jate the
 Not a supporter of international law
 One committee was of the view that Gandhi was not a genuine politician or a supporter of international law, nor was he primarily a humanitarian aid worker nor an organizer of the International Peace Congress
 gandhi ji ne vishwa ko yah dikhaaya ki ki satyagrah ke jariye kuch bhi hasil kiya ja saktaa he
 He was nominated for the Nobel Prize before martyrdom in 1937, 1938, 1939, 1947 and finally in January 1948

 lekin loksabhaa kii tarah rajyasabha main bhi congress ke haath kaa saath modi sarkaar ke saath ho, ye jaruri nahin

 Not only this, burning firecrackers this Diwali will prove to be costly for the people
 darasal, pradooshan kii rokthaam ke maddenjar supreme court ne dilli-ensiaar ke baahar se aane vaale pataakhon ke stock par pabandi lagaai he
 At the same time, about 50 percent of the temporary license has been cut
 jisase pataakhaa bazaar bilkul manda he
 The fireworks market in Jama Masjid area of delhi is deserted
 ye wo bazaar he jo pataakhon kii vairieti ke liye mashhoor he, lekin is saal yahaan asthaayee taur par lagane vaali kareeb 40 dukaanon ko license nahin mila he
 Therefore, cracker traders are disappointed
 puraani dilli ke is bazaar main dashahara se pehle hi pataakhe kii dukaane sajani shuru ho jaati thi, lekin is saal diwali ke 15 din pehle bhi bazaar main sannata he
 In fact, during the hearing of a petition on the issue of increasing pollution, the Supreme Court has ordered a 50 percent reduction in the number of temporary licenses of firecrackers in delhi-ncr
 saath hi dilli-ensiaar main duusare rajyon se pataakhon ke stock laane par bhi pratibandh he
 Therefore, this year only old stock is available in permanent cracker shops
 matlab saaf he ki is diwali sevakashi se aane vaale kai branded pataakhe logon kii pahunch se dur rahenge
 Until the next order of the Supreme Court, firecrackers in Delhi will be able to sell only the old stock
 kayaas ye bhi lagaae ja rahe hai ki nayaa stock nahin hone kii vajah se pataakhe mahange bikenge
 The West Delhi Fireworks Association has also written a letter to Prime Minister Modi expressing his displeasure over the ban on the new stock of firecrackers in Delhi NCR and appealed to intervene in the matter
 pataakhaa vikritaon kaa maananaa he ki dilli main badhate pradooshan ke liye kai duusare kaaran bhi jimmedaar hai
 Therefore, cracker traders have also filed a reconsideration petition in the Supreme Court

 mumbai kii barish ek baar phir se charchaa main he
 Early rains in the city have significantly affected lives and traffic
 aane vaale dinon main bhi aise halaat ban sakate hai
 Anyway, Mumbai has seen the terrible problems due to rain in 2005 and 2017
 aise main pani bhari sadakon main chalanaa kabhi-kabhi hamaari majaburi ban jaati he
 In such a situation, if you are walking by car and get stuck in the rain then keep these tips in mind
 agboost main pani ko jaane se roke:jab bhi bhayankar barish kii sthiti main drive karen sabase pehle sadak par pani kii gaharaai ko bhaanp len, kyonki har car of-road car nahin hoti
 Walk slowly on water-laden roads and drive the car on first gear
 excilirator lagaataar den taaki pani agboost main naa pahunche orinjanako kharaab hone se bachaaya ja sake
 2
 car chhod den:agar barish thamane kaa naam naa le or pani kaa str badhata hi jaae to koi thik si jagah dekhakar apni car park kar den
 Filling water in the car can short circuit the electrical system, which can damage the entire security system
 ashanka ye bhi he ki takneekee khami kii vajah se car andar se bhi lock ho saktaa he, saath hi khidkiyaan bhi kaam karnaa band kar sakati hai
 It is better to leave the car in a safe place and leave
 3
 How to break the window: If your car stops working due to technical fault
 aise main sabase pehle car chhodkar nikalne kii koshish karen
 If the doors do not open and the windows are also closed, break the windows
 saavdhaanee ke taur par ek chota hathaudaa hameshaa car ke andar par rakhana chahie
 However, if there is no hammer, then the head rest can be used
 edjasteble head rest ko nikaala ja saktaa he or iskaa bottm khidki todane ke kaam aa saktaa he
 While breaking the window, keep in mind the distance
 4
 Drive slowly: Even if the situation is not like flood and rain is getting slow, visibility and traction can be reduced
 aisi sthiti main gaadi dhire chalaanaa hi behatar rahegaa
 The possibility of aqua planning (slippery on wheels) in such rains increases
 5
 Keep the smartphone with you and avoid rumors: If you get stuck in the car or do not name the rain stop, then in such a situation first try to keep your smartphone safe and turn off the data or turn on the power saving mode to save the battery
 
 watsap yaa kisi bhi anya plateform par milane vaali afvaahon se bachein or sthiti kii jaankaree sabase pehle parivaar ke kisi sadsy ko den

 Shahi, HRD minister Pramod Kumar, who has been living in financial crisis for a long time, started returning to life in February as he was getting a teacher's job after waiting for almost two and a half decades
 par navada ke is prashikshit adhyaaapak kii yah khushi zyada din nahin rahane vaali
 Pramod, who is running his 60th phase of life, is to retire in June this year
 kuch aisa hi kissa isi jile ke krishna kumaar kaa bhi he
 He too got a job in February but has to retire in March
 shikshak kii naukari ke liye unhone 1971-73 satr main navada teachers training college se degree lee thi
 In 2006, when contractual teachers were hired, they did not get a chance
 lihaaja, dedh bighas kii kheti se tangahaali main jidangi jeena unki majaburi ban gai
 After waiting for a long time, the Supreme Court's decision in favor of trained teachers raised their hopes

 But when the reality came out, he said, "being disappointed is not as dangerous as dying of hope
" ''pramod or krishna akele aise shikshak nahin hai
 On the order of the Supreme Court, the plight of most teachers being restored to 34,540 posts in Bihar is similar

 Now that Kamata is going to be 60 years old on March 2, 2012, she was reinstated at the middle school in Babhnore in February
 ve kehete hai, ''mere kai saathi bade padon se ritair hone vaale hai, tab do maah ke liye shikshak banane kaa mujhe mauka mila he
 What an irony! ”people like Pramod, Krishnakumar and Kamta still turned out to be lucky, who got a chance to become a teacher for a few months

 yahi nahin, 60 saal kii umr paar chuke saikadon prashikshit ummidavaar shikshak nahin ban paae
 Actually, this story of the troubles of trained teachers is two and a half decades old
 1988 tak shikshakon kii bahaali prashikshit ummidavaaron kii variyata ke aadhaar par hoti thi
 The problem of trained teachers started from 1991 when the then government reinstated 25,000 teachers by conducting competitive examination through BPSC instead of panel
 isamen prashikshit adhyapakon ko koi chhot nahin mili
 a legal battle ensued from that time
 is kadi main jahanabad ke ram vinay kumaar ne patna hycourt main arji daakhil kii, lekin raahat na milane par supreme court main vishesh anumati yachika daali
 The order took place on 5 September 1997, in which trained candidates were tested

 ) Poonam, the wife of suspended BJP leader Kirti Azad, said on Monday that the party, like Navjot Singh Sidhu, treated her and her husband unfairly
 is tarah kii atakalein he ki bhaajapa kii dilli ikai kii pravaktaa or teen baar bhaajapa kii rashtriya kaaryakarini kii sadsy rah chukin punam aam aadmi party se jud sakati hai

 aaazaad ke parivaar ke kareebi sutron ke mutabik apane nilamban ke baad kirti bhi party main 'asahaj' mahasoos kar rahe hai

 On Thursday, the Karnataka High Court had dismissed Shivkumar's plea challenging the summons issued by the ED
 iske baad unhen agency ke saamne pesh hona padaa
 Earlier in the day, Sivakumar hinted that his 'crucial role' in securing Gujarat Congress mlas in a resort in Karnataka during the 2017 Rajya Sabha elections is the reason for income tax raids and subsequent ED action
 kendriya agency ne pichley saal sitambar main sivakumar, nai dilli sthit karnataka bhawan ke ek karmchaaree or anya ke khilaaf dhanshodhan kaa maamla darj kiya tha
 The ED case is based on a chargesheet filed by the Income Tax Department before a special court in Bengaluru last year alleging tax evasion and hawala transactions worth crores of rupees
 soshal media par in dinon kurukshetra kii ek bacchee kaa video viral ho rahaa he, jisamen vah barish ke bich live reporting karte hue dikhaai de rahi hai
 The girl seen in the video is named Prachi and is 10 years old
 bacchee video main jamaa hue pani ke bich jaakar logon kii samasyaon ko bataati he
 In the video, she is telling that there has been a flood and it has become difficult for people to move
 chhathin kaksha main padhane vaali praachi bade hi dilachasp andaaj main apni cameraman jyoti kaa naam bhi leti hai
 This girl is being highly praised
 lekin iske saath hi uski reporting ne system par bhi sawaal khadey kiye he ki jab ek barish main kurukshetra jaise shahar kaa yah haal ho gaya he to dur-daraaj ilaakon main kya haal hoga
 Prachi's camera gave every detail that the people of this time are facing
 patrakarita ke shabdon main baat karen to isko 'citijan jarnalism' kaha jaataa he
 Meaning when a citizen himself reports a news
 beete kuch saalon main citijan jarnalism kaa prachlan badha he jahaan aam janata khud hi muddon ko uthaa rahi he
 Citizen journalism has become easier in the era of social media
 vahiin baat karen baadh or barish ke baad jalajmav kii to sarkarein bade-bade daawey karti hai lekin ek hi barish main in daavon kii pole khul jaati he
 Last year in Gurugram too, the entire city was in a bad state due to water logging after the rain
 dilli main agar bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) sarkaar banane kii sthiti main aati he to isamen bahut kuch uttar pradesh main uske pradarshan ke saath bihar main uski jiti hui siton par bhi nirbhar karegaa
 In the 2014 elections, the NDA won a resounding victory under the leadership of the BJP and it was not accompanied by Nitish Kumar
 2014 main bihar main endie ne kul 40 main se 31 siton par jeet hasil kii thi
 In 2014, Nitish Kumar's JDU contested alone and was reduced to just two seats
 lekin, aisa lagata he ki bhaajapa bihar main jeet ko lekar shuru se bahut aashwast nahin rahi
 Otherwise, the BJP leaders of the state were not even embraced by dividing JD-U in 2 seats with half of 17 seats
 bihar bhaajapa ke sutron kii maane to kisi bhi sthiti main endie ke liye is baar 25 se adhik siton par jeet hasil karnaa aasaan nahin hoga
 On the condition of anonymity, the Bihar BJP leader said, in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the NDA seats in Bihar will be less than in 2014 and the NDA may lose five-six seats
 haalanki, bihar main isse pehle kai baar bhaajapa or jadyu saath milakar lade the
 In 2009, he got 32 seats in the state
 2014 main bihar main modi lahar main nitish kumaar kaa karishma naakaam rahaa aise main jab 2017 main phir ek baar nitish kumaar endie ke paale main aa gaye to laga ki 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main endie kii sthiti 2014 se bhi adhik majboot ho jaaegi
 However, the Rashtriya Loksamata Party, which was a constituent of the NDA in 2014, is no longer in the NDA
 upendra kushvaha ne seat bantwaare ke maamle main ab mahagathbandhan kaa daaman tham liya
 Despite this, due to Nitish Kumar being in the NDA, the BJP was assuming that this time there will be a good performance from 2014 also
 aise main prashn he ki aakhir endie kii siten bihar se ghatane kii ashankaayen kyon hai
 Knowledgeable people basically give two reasons for this
 awwal, rashtriya janata dal kii taraf se tejasvi yadav ne jo mahagathbandhan banaaya he, usamen jatigat sameekaran endie ke mukaable zyada sateek tareeke se saadhaa gaya he
 An example is to take Nishad leader Mukesh Sahni along
 unki viypi ko saath laakar mahagathbandhan ne nishad samaaj ko har seat par apane saath karne main kaaphi had tak kamyaabi hasil kii he
 Especially, the Muzaffarpur seat may get stuck due to this
 viypi teen siton par chunaav lard rahi he
 In the same way, the Mahagathbandhan has done the work of bringing Dalits along by bringing former Chief Minister of Bihar Jitan Ram Manjhi from JDU and forming Hindustan Awam Morcha
 unke aane se dakshin bihar kii siton par dalit samaaj kaa ek bada hissaa mahagathbandhan ke paksh main khadaa ho gaya he
 NDA is also said to be at a disadvantage with Upendra Kushwaha joining the Grand Alliance
 kuch siton par upendra kushvaha ke samarthak jeet-haar tay karne kii sthiti main hai
 One reason for the nda's loss has been the bjp's arbitrary attitude in ticket distribution
 misaal ke taur par bhagalpur seat bhaajapa kii paaramparik seat rahi he, use jadyu ko de dena bhaajapa ke lihaaj se thik nahin mana ja rahaa
 Similarly, Gopalji Thakur is being considered weak in Darbhanga and Ashok Yadav, son of Hukumdev Narayan Yadav is also weak in Madhubani seat
 unke mukaable mahagathbandhan kaa haath upar he
 Similarly, the grand alliance is getting the benefit of the Congress along with some seats
 kuch aisi siten hai jahaan ummidavaar kisi agadi jati kaa he to waisi siton par bhi saamaanya taur par endie ke saath dikhne vaali agadi jatiyaan congress ummidavaar ke paksh main dikh rahi hai
 Overall, the caste equation of the grand alliance at the grassroots level looks stronger than in 2014
 bhaajapa ke khilaaf aisi hi ashanka paswan voton ko lekar bhi he
 It is being said that this time the Paswan Samaj has left the NDA
 isaki ek vajah yah bhi he ki apane hisse main ai kul 6 main se 3 siten ramvilas paswan ne apane parivaar waalon ko de di hai
 On the other hand, jd-u's Mahadalit vote is also not being transferred in favor of BJP
 asal main, nitish kumaar ke vot bank main musalmaan bhi hai or mahadalit bhi
