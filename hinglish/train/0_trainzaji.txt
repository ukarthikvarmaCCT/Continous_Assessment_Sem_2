 bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar dwaara gujarat main mukhyamantri narendra modi kii lagaataar teesri jeet par sadhi gayi chuppi ke peeche kai prakaar kii atakalein lagaai ja rahi hai or is rukh ko 2010 ke bihar vidhansabha chunaavon se bhi jodakar dekha ja rahaa he, jisamen gujarat ke mukhyamantri ne us samay nitish kumaar kii jeet par koi badhai nahin di thi
 Sources close to the chief minister said that Nitish Kumar had a landslide victory in the Bihar assembly elections in 2010, but for this Narendra Modi did not congratulate him
 sambhavat: nitish kumaar kaa rukh bhi sochi-samajhi ranneeti ke tahat uske jawaab main he
 He said that though Modi's third consecutive victory is not a trivial victory, in the Bihar Assembly elections in 2010, the percentage of victory of the candidates led by Nitish Kumar was 85
 sutron ne kaha, tab bhi narendra modi ne pratyaksh yaa paroksh taur par nitish kumaar ko badhai nahin di thi
 The BJP and JDU alliance swept RJD supremo Lalu Prasad, Congress and LJP to win 206 out of 243 seats in the 2010 assembly elections
 nitish kumaar kii chuppi se ab kai prakaar ke kayaas lagaae ja rahe hai
 There is speculation that this silence has been carried out under a well thought-out strategy, or another episode of confrontation between the two NDA veterans
 ek aadhikarik kaarykram ke baad shuukravaar ko jab narendra modi kii gujarat main aitihaasik jeet par pratikriya maangi gai, to vah (nitish) bina kuch kahe ek anya baithak ke liye ravaanaa ho gaye
 On Thursday too, the Chief Minister refused to give any response regarding Gujarat
 nitish kumaar kii rahasyamay chuppi ko jediu ke sahyogi dal bijepi ke netaaon ne pasand nahin kiya
 Many leaders are wondering about this
 bijepi ke pradesh adhyaksh seepi thakur ne nitish ke maun dhaaran par kaha ki unhen aashcharya ho rahaa he ki mukhyamantri kyon chup hai? yah ek saamaanya baat he ki jeet par ek-duusare ko badhai di jaati he
 Giriraj Singh, a staunch supporter of Narendra Modi and Minister of Animal and Fisheries Resources in the Nitish government, said, congratulations are a normal process
 ek haara hua pratyaashee bhi jeet hasil karne vaale ko badhai detaa he
 Nitish Kumar's displeasure is evident after the 2002 riots in Gujarat
 tippaniyan In a recent interview to a national daily, Nitish Kumar questioned the secular image of Narendra Modi as a candidate for the nda's 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 ise modi kii ummidavaari ke virodh ke taur par dekha ja rahaa tha
 Narendra Modi is one of the star campaigners of BJP, but due to pressure from Nitish, BJP kept Modi out of the election campaign in Bihar in 2009 Lok Sabha and 2010 assembly elections
 varsh 2010 main bijepi kii patna main hui rashtriya kaaryakarini kii baithak main bhi ghamaasan hua tha
 Annoyed by an advertisement published in newspapers with Modi's photo to help the Kosi flood victims, Nitish Kumar then canceled a dinner with BJP leaders
 mukhyamantri ke kareebi sutron ne bataaya ki 2010 main bihar vidhansabha chunaavon main nitish kumaar ko baari jeet mili thi, lekin iske liye narendra modi ne koi badhai nahin di thi
 Perhaps Nitish Kumar's stance is also in response to his well thought out strategy
 unhone kaha ki modi kii lagaataar teesri baar jeet haalanki koi choti-moti jeet nahin he, lekin 2010 main bihar main vidhansabha chunaavon main nitish kumaar ke netritv main ummidavaaron kii jeet kaa pratishat 85 tha
 Even then, sources said, Narendra Modi did not directly or indirectly congratulate Nitish Kumar
 bijepi or jediu gathbandhan ne argedy supremeo lalu prasad, congress or lojpa ko dhul chataate hue 2010 ke vidhansabha chunaav main 243 siton main se 206 main jeet hasil kii thi
 With the silence of Nitish Kumar, many kinds of speculations are being made now
 atakalein lagaai ja rahi hai ki yah maun sochi-samajhi ranneeti ke tahat dhaaran kiya gaya he, yaa endie ke donon diggajon ke bich takaraav kaa ek or prakaran he
 After an official event on Friday, when a response was sought on Narendra Modi's historic victory in Gujarat, he (nitish) left for another meeting without saying anything
 guuruuvaar ko bhi mukhyamantri ne gujarat ke sambandh main koi pratikriya dene se inkaar kiya tha
 Nitish Kumar's mysterious silence was not liked by jdu's ally BJP leaders
 kai netaa is par aashcharya jataa rahe hai
 BJP state president CP Thakur said on Nitish's silence that he is wondering why the chief minister is silent? It is normal that each other is congratulated on victory
 narendra modi ke kattar samarthak or nitish sarkaar main pashu evam matsay sansaadhan mantri giriraaj singh ne kaha, badhai dena ek saamaanya prakriya he
 a defeated candidate also congratulates the winner
 gujarat main 2002 ke dangon ke baad nitish kumaar kii naapsandgi jag jaahir he
 The comments haal main ek rashtriya dainik ko die gaye saakshaatkaar main nitish kumaar ne endie ke 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaavon ko lekar ummidavaar ke rup main narendra modi kii dharmanirpeksh chhavi par sawaal uthaaya tha
 This was seen as an opposition to Modi's candidature
 narendra modi bijepi ke star prachaarkon main shumaar hai, lekin nitish ke dabaav ke kaaran bijepi ne 2009 main loksabhaa or 2010 main vidhansabha chunaavon main bihar main modi ko chunaav prachaar ke kaarykram se baahar rakhaa tha
 In the year 2010, there was a fire in the bjp's national executive meeting in Patna

 The Indian cricket team is going to face Bangladesh on Tuesday at the Edgbaston Cricket Ground in the ICC World Cup-2019
 abhi tak behtareen form main dikhi bhartiya team ko haalanki apane pichley match main england se haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 Bangladesh is a team from which everyone expected a good performance in this World Cup, but the kind of cricket this Asian team is playing has surprised everyone
 is world cap main is team kii khaasiyat uske pradarshan main nirantarata rahi he, jisaki kami aaj se pehle team ke saath pai jaati thi
 There have been 3 matches in ODI World Cup so far, out of which India have won 2 matches, while Bangladesh have got success in one match
 2007 world cap main bangladesh ne kharaab kiya tha bharat kaa khelezbeston main hone vaale match main bharat ko satark rahanaa hoga
 Although India are one point away from going into the semi-finals, but if they lose against Bangladesh, it will be like a match or die against Sri Lanka
 bangladesh kisi bhi team kaa khel bigaad sakati he
 In the 2007 World Cup, this team defeated India out of the opening round
 aise main bharat ko bangladesh kii maujuuda form ko dekhakar satark rahanaa hoga
 dhawan-shankar is out of the tournament Bangladesh has generally done well against India, winning many wins
 is baar yah team lay main he or aatmavishvaas se bhari he
 India has also suffered another setback before this match
 harfanmaulaa khilaadi vijay shankar pair main chot ke kaaran world cap se baahar ho gaye hai
 Shankar is the second player from India who has dropped out of the World Cup
 unase pehle shikhar dhawan ko bhi anguuthe main chot ke kaaran toornament se baahar janaa padaa tha
 Point Table Shakib's fine performances with both bat and ball have contributed to the Bangladesh team's most experienced player, Shakib Al Hasan, who has done well with the bat and ball
 vahiin, tameem ikbaal ne dakshin africa, england, newjiland jaisi tiimon ke khilaaf bade maichon main balle se behtareen pradarshan kiya he
 Bangladesh is not just on the strength of Shakib
 tameem ikbaal, mahamudullah, mushfikur rahim, litan das ne bhi shaakib ke saath milakar scoreboard ko chalaaya he
 In bowling, captain Mashrafe Mortaza, Mustafizur Rahman has been playing a big role for the team
 semifinal ke liye bangladesh kii ummid jindalambe antaraal ke brake ke baad maidan par utar rahi bangladesh ek baar phir bharat ke khilaaf shaakib ke upar sabase zyada nirbhar karegi or ummid karegi ki unki or rahim kii jodi bade match main ek baar phir kamaal dikhaae
 a win in this match is also necessary for Bangladesh to keep their semi-final hopes alive
 england ke khilaaf bharat kaa pradarshan lachar rahaa thabite saal main bangladesh kii pahchaan rahi he ki jab uske saamne karo yaa maro kii sthiti aati he to wo khatarnaak rup le leti he
 India has to be aware of this
 agar bhartiya team kii baat kii jaae to vah ek din pehle yani ravivaar ko england ke khilaaf kheli thi or ek din ke aaraam ke baad hi use yah muqabla khelnaa he
 The winning order of the Indian team against England came to a halt
 mejabaan team ke khilaaf bhartiya team ne ran bhi lutaae or uske ballebaaj ran bhi nahin bana paae
 Team India will have to walk with the backup plan
 Indian bowlers will have to get into this match with better strategy and backup plan because the kind of batting that Jason Roy, Johnny Bairstow have done, Tamim, Shakib and Rahim are capable of batting
 agar bhartiya ballebaaji kii baat kii jaae to ek baar phir bharat ko gaur karnaa hoga ki sheersh kram ke ballebaaj kaa ant tak na rahanaa team ke liye haar kii sambhaavna ko badha detaa he
 Rohit and Kohli played excellent innings against England, but as soon as they were both out, the weight came in the middle order where young Rishabh Pant was given the chance at number-4 in place of injured Shankar

 He asked Mufti how would it be possible to support the two together? @ mehboobamuftihas told the Congress she will support the UPA candidate for # rajyasabhavice Chairman
 She’s also told the BJP she will support the NDA candidate
 How does that work exactly? - Omar Abdullah (@omarabdullah) August 7, 2018 Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti did not immediately respond to Omar Abdullah and simply replied to him with an emoji

 Nice emoji use 👍🏼— Omar Abdullah (@omarabdullah)august 7, 2018mufti ne satta paksh or vipaksh donon ke ummidavaaron ko samarthan dene ke bayaan ko phek news or kalpana qaraar diya
 Responding to Abdullah, he tweeted, 'fake news and false news are usually run by dubious news channels

 darasal, akali dal ko ummid thi ki rajyasabha main endie kaa upasabhapati kaa ummidavaar unka hoga
 Explain that Naresh Gujral's name from the Akali Dal was in the discussion, but at the last moment the BJP made JDU MP Harivansh a candidate, which has caused resentment in the Akali Dal

 BJP candidate and sitting MP Satish Gautam, who won from Uttar Pradesh's Aligarh Lok Sabha seat, has once played Jinnah Raag
 unhone kaha ki ab jinna kii tasviir ko pakistan bheja jayega
 Satish Gautam won from Aligarh by defeating SP-BSP-RLD alliance candidate Ajit Balyan by 2,29,261 votes
 jeet hasil karne ke baad unhone patrakaron se baatcheet main kaha ki aligarh muslim uniwarsity (AMU) main jo jinna kii tasviir lagi he vah ek prakaar kii maansikta ko darshaati he
 He said, 'now even Jinnah will not be found in this country, will go directly to Pakistan
 'unhone kaha, 'pichhali baaten bhul jaaie
 Now Jinnah's picture will be sent to Pakistan
 tasviir kii vahaan jarurat hogi, hamaare yahaan nahin
 AMU runs with the help of the Center, its rules and regulations have to be complied with

 On getting reservation, they will be able to study by taking admission here
 unhen naukari bhi mil sakegi
 "now i see how the AMU Vice Chancellor does not answer" Satish Gautam did not stop here, he further said that the AMU Vice Chancellor has not responded to many of my letters, which is unconstitutional
 ab dekhtaa hum ki wo jawaab kaise nahin dete hai? bataa den ki may 2018, main aligarh ke saansad satish gautam ne hi yah kahkar jinna vivaad ko hawa di thi ki eemyu se 'jinna maansikta' dur kerani padegi
 After this the dispute reached the central government

 Satish Gautam had said that his first issue is that students of SC / ST and OBC Hindu society should also get reservation in Aligarh Muslim University
 ab jeet dobaaraa jeet milane ke baad ek baar phir satish gautam ne eemyu se jinna kii tasviir ko hataane kii baat kahi he
 He also said that SC-ST and OBC students will get admission and reservation in AMU

 rahul gandhi ko jawaab dete hue aarake singh ne kaha ki shaheedon ke parivaar kii aad main shahadat par or hamaari sena kii veerta par sawaal uthaanaa galat baat he
 This has never happened before
 kendriya mantri singh ne kaha ki pehle hindustan main bahut saare hamale hue, lekin congress party kii sarkaar ne koi badla nahin liya
 It is the government of Narendra Modi, which has avenged the martyrdom
 pulavama hamalaa hua, to pradhanmantri narendra modi ne badla liya
 The Indian Air Force entered Pakistan and destroyed the terrorists' bases
 agar antarrashtriya ranneeti kii samaj rakhane vaale kisi bhi vyakti se is maamle main baat kii jaaegi to vah vahi batayega jo modi sarkaar ne kiya he
 What the Modi government did after the Pulwama terror attack, gives a strong message to the terrorists that if you kill us, we will kill you
 aap ek maarenge, to ham do maarenge
 RK Singh said that through air strike, the Modi government also gave the message that if we raise the eye on India, we will enter and kill it
 isse pehle kii sarkaar ne to kisi bhi aatanki hamale kaa badla nahin liya
 Attacking the Congress President, RK Singh said that Rahul Gandhi should be ashamed for attacking the brave pilots who attacked terrorists inside Pakistan
 pakistan main poster bvoy banane ke rahul gandhi par lage aaropon or narendra modi par congress adhyaksh ke palatwaar par aarake singh ne kaha ki pakistan main poster bvoy koun he, ye log bhalee-bhaanti jaanate hai
 Pakistan TV channels show the poster boy
 is dauraan aarake singh ne kaha ki congress party ke adhyaksh pakistan kii bhashaa bol rahe hai, jo behad sharmnaak baat he
 In fact, on Thursday, Rahul Gandhi said in the press conference that the family of the soldiers who were martyred in the Pulwama attack have also asked what action was taken against Pakistan and its terrorists
 During this, the Congress President said that he targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 Nawaz went to Pakistan to meet Sharif and called the ISI after the attack in Pathankot
 aapako bataa den ki pulavama aatanki hamale ke baad bhartiya vayusena ne pakistan ke balakot main ghuskar aatanki sanghathan jaish-e-mohammad ke thikaanon par air strike kii thi, jisamen kaaphi aatankiyon ke maare jane kii baat kahi ja rahi he
 However, some leaders in India are asking for evidence of an air strike by the Indian Air Force
 vahiin, neshnal technical research orgenigeshan (NTRO) ke servilans se khulaasa hua ki jab bhartiya vayusena ne air strike kii, us samay balakot main jaish-e-mohammad ke aatanki campon main 280 se zyada mobile phone active the
 Based on this, it is being claimed that more than 280 terrorists were killed in the action of the Indian Air Force
 ham sab jaanate hai ki uria kheti or khet ke liye acha nahin he
 This is affecting our health as well
 lekin uria kii duniya main kya chal rahaa he, ham nahin jaanate hai
 Saw an article by G
 Ravi Prasad on the page of farming in the Indian Express
 ji ravi prasad ke parichay main likhaa he ki ve krishi rasayan or khaad prabandhan ke visheshgy hai
 Their question is how much urea does India need
 jitna uria he wo paryaapt he
 Giving it in the hands of farmers at cheap rates is neither good for agriculture nor subsidy wise for the country's economy
 saadhe paanch rupee prati kilo se bhi kam dar par kisaan uria paata he, isliye uskaa istamaal karne main sankoch nahin karata he
 Farmers are well aware of the loss of urea but they do not get out of its cycle due to many reasons
 uria jab kheton main jaataa he to mitti kii nami ke sampark main aane ke baad ammonia gas banaata he or use aabo-hawa main pahunchaa detaa he
 The nitrogen released from it affects ground water
 agar uria kaa zyaada istamaal karenge to hawa or pani main nitrate kaa zehar badhata he
 Is polluted
 bharat ne 2015-16 main neem coted uria kaa utpaadan anivaary kar diya
 Neem oil slows down the process of ammonia and nitrogen formation
 uria kaa bag bhi 50 kilo se ghataakar 45 kilo kaa kar diya gaya
 The European Union has decided that by 2020, ureos and nitrification inhibitors will be used in Ureos
 neem kii parat ke alaava
 Is all urea neem coated really? This question arises in the mind
 ham nahin jaanate ki neem kot karne ke liye kitni factriyon main zaruri takniki badlaav kiye gaye, un par kitna nivesh aayaa? uria neem coted he yaa nahin, isaki jaanch aam kisaan kaise karata he? iskaa jawaab kisaan hi den jo uria kaa istamaal karte hai
 Production of urea 24 in 2015-16
 48 million ton ho gaya tha
 Sale 31
 97 million ton
 This was the most
 bikri zyada hui kyonki ham uria kaa aayaat bhi karte hai
 There is a partial decline in urea production in 2016–17, 2017–18
 24
 20 million and 24
 02 militan ton
 There is also a slight decrease in sales
 aaayaatit uria main bhi kami aati he

 Ravi Prasad says that the government should speed up efforts to reduce the consumption of urea but its focus is on increasing the production of urea
 sarkaar band padi paanch uria factory ko chaalu karne ja rahi he
 Chambal Fertilizer is also setting up a plant
 agar in plant main kshamta ke anusaar uria kaa utpaadan hua to bharat main uria kaa utpaadan 32 million ton salanaa ho jayega jo 2015-16 ke charam 24
 It will be more than 48 million tonnes
 ji ravi prasad bataate hai ki iskaa bhaar bharat ke khajaane par padegaa
 For this, they have calculated the quantity and cost of natural gas used in the production of urea
 is aadhaar par bataate hai ki zarurat kaa aadha prakritik gas kaa aayaat karnaa hota he
 Natural gas is limited in quantity
 inkaa istamaal uria ke utpaadan main kyon hona chahie
 If India reduces the consumption of urea by only 10 per cent, which is possible, then the import of urea will be saved on the basis of five years average of Rs 5,680 crore
 nae maanak se uria banane kii laagat 6,400 karod kii aegi
 due to the decrease in consumption, but the health of agriculture and farms will also be benefited
 ji ravi prasad kaa kahana he ki agar uria 250 dollars prati ton ke hisaab se aayaat ho saktaa he to 420 dollar prati ton utpaadan par kharch karne kaa kya tuk he
 Anyway, the government has to give a lot of subsidy on urea
 nae plant main uria kaa utpaadan bad to jayega magar uskaa niryaat mushkil hoga
 Because natural gas has to be imported at very expensive rates for production, which will increase the cost
 jaahir he koshish hogi ki kisi tarah se bhartiya bazaar main hi isaki khapat badhaai jaae
 Where do such things happen in Hindi newspapers
 hamen nahin maaloom ki ji ravi prasad kii baton kaa doosraa paksh kya he, phir bhi aap ise padhein
 At least i will start thinking about the urea question on this excuse
 nai chiz milegi bahes karne kii

 avam ek group he, jo pichley saal aam aadmi party se vimukh hue kaaryakartaaon ne banaaya tha
 Just four days before the election, Awam has tried to spread sensation by doing something like disclosure against the Aam Aadmi Party
 avam kaa aarope he ki aam aadmi party ke khate main pichley saal april maah main 50-50 lakh ke chaar check jamaa hue
 The four companies who gave these checks as donations are actually bogus
 ye companiyaan 'blike mani' ko 'white mani' banane kaa kaam kar rahi hai
 Awam himself showed two checks of these companies at the press conference, which had no date
 isse aam aadmi party ke khilaaf kya siddh hota he? avam sabit karnaa chaahati he ki aam aadmi party apane kaale dhan ko check main tabdeel karwaakar safed dikhaanaa chaahati he, lekin avam khud apane sawaalon main fansati nazar aa rahi he
 In the press conference, when he was asked who are the directors of these companies, then he deferred this question by saying that we cannot name because of security reasons
 jab unase poocha gaya ki in companiyon ne aapako bina taarikh daale check kaise de die to iskaa bhi jawaab unase nahin dete bana
 People's intent gets suspicious from here
 yah sach he ki in companiyon ke pate farzi hai, lekin ye companiyaan registerd hai, inke paas bank acount he or pan number bhi
 There is no information available about their business and losses and profits
 aam aadmi party ne ehtiyaat nahin barti, lekin sawaal ye bhi he ki ehtiyaat kis had tak barti jaae
 If donations come to the party, then at most only its bank related information can be seen and which was also seen by the Aam Aadmi Party
 haalanki ek baar ke liye itani badi rakam chande main ai dekh kar aam aadmi party ke man main jigyaasa zarur paidaa honi chahie thi ki aakhir koun un par itnaa meharbaan he
 The Aam Aadmi Party has collected about 20 crore rupees so far and it is obvious that these 2 crore rupees also have a big contribution in it, but legally there is no case against the Aam Aadmi Party on this matter
 agar sawaal manshaa par uth rahe hai to uske tark main aam aadmi party kaa jawaab ye he ki agar ye kaala dhan hi hota to use check main tabdeel karvaa kar uski jaankaree website par kyon daalate
 After all, the protesters got information from the website of the Aam Aadmi Party
 in aaropon ko bijepi ne bhi apane paksh main khub bhunaane kii koshish kii
 But BJP also did not make firm preparations
 somvaar ko hui apni press conference main kai betuke sawaal uthaati nazar ai
 For example, how did 4 checks get together at 12 o'clock at night? Yogendra Yadav said in his reply that the BJP is giving it a big intelligence color, but the party uploads the information, not the bank, on the website
 is baat main sachai bhi he, kyonki raat ke 12 baje bank nahin khule hote
 a sting is also circulating on social media, where members of the public are seen plotting to take off someone, although journalists cannot confirm how accurate the sting is
 khabar ye bhi he ki avam ke sadasyon kaa sambandh bhaajapa se he or aam aadmi party ke saath-saath congress kaa bhi maananaa he ki ye bhaajapa kii koi 'darty trick' he
 When the Aam Aadmi Party said that it would appeal to the court to investigate the funds of all the parties, then BJP Finance Minister Arun Jaitley made a ridiculous statement that the honorable court should not be dragged into this dirty politics
 sawaal ye he ki arun jetali kiski gandi raajnneeti kii taraf ishaara kar rahe the? The loss of these allegations could have been done to the Aam Aadmi Party if the rest of the political parties had made their accounts public, but at this time, Omar Abdullah of BJP and National Conference are also ready to prove that Aam Aadmi Party is no different, Rather, there is a party like them
 aakhir isaki jaanch kyon naa ho ki ye companiyaan farji paton par registerd kaise huin? inke maalikon kaa naam saarvajanik kyon nahin hona chahie, aakhir aaropon ke anusaar, ye companiyaan hi kaale dhan ko safed karti hai
 Why did the BJP not order an inquiry despite its government at the Center? Overall, this move of BJP and Awam also seems to be a flop
 shiv thapa, 18 varshaboxing, 56 kilo, baintowet,guwahati, assam
 In his story, he calls it a mind game, in which being attentive, competing and not losing temper weighs on age and experience
 shiv thapa ne ise tab sabit kar dikhaaya, jab unhone besagrade vinar toornament, 2011 main senior level ke apane pehle hi antarrashtriya compitishan main vishwa main duusari variyata praapt or amaor boxing champion delklive detelin ko bulgaria main haraa kar gold medal jeeta
 This optimistic boy from Assam was a fan of football, but he chose boxing over football at the age of nine due to Mike Tyson's inspiring themes as well as his desire to choose an individual sport
 thapa ke parivaar ne unka puraa saath diya
 His karate instructor father Padam learned about boxing to help his son
 thapa ke bade bhai unke saathi hote the or thapa kaa kahana he ki kuch sabase shandaar mukaable unke bhai ke saath hue hai
 This time Thapa is included in India's seven-man boxing squad at the Olympics, desperate to achieve a milestone
 khaas he april main kazakhstan ke astana main thapa ne asian olympic qualifing event main 56 kilo baintowet main 2010 ke asian games ke bronj medal vijeta syria ke vesam salaamana ko haraa kar gold medal jeeta tha
 Challenges While most boxers analyze their opponent's techniques in depth, Thapa avoids research and plans counter-attacks on the spot, anticipating his opponent's moves
 mishan olympic yah tin-senseshan galtiyaan karata he, lekin unhen swikaarne main sankoch bhi nahin karata he

 If you want to get a product that has a discount, then your search should be completed with closed-end mutual funds in the stock market
 bahut se mutual fund bazaar main baari chhot ke saath mil rahe hai yani net asset vailu (enevi) se kaaphi kam keemat par
 Here is some information related to how it works and should you invest money in it
 mutual pha fund mukhya rup se do tarah ke hote hai—open anded or closed and
 Open-ended mutual fund funds are those that can be bought and sold at any time or exited while closed-ended funds can only be purchased from the fund house at the time of launch
 saath hi nishchit avadhi ke baad hi aap isse baahar aa sakate hai yani bech sakate hai
 This period may vary
 taralata sunishchit karne ke liye in skiimon ke liye share bazaar main soochibaddh hona jaruri hota he taaki niveshak secondary bazaar main inhen kharid or bech saken
 But such funds would be available in lesser quantity in the stock markets and hence are sold at lower prices with a discount to the NAV
 udhaaharan ke liye axis equity adwantage fund siries-1 regular plan (growth) kii enevi 1 aktubar ko 11
 04 Rs
 thi lekin bombai stock exange (bisai) main us din ke aakhir main iskaa mulya 9
 38 Rs
 tha
 This means that it sold at a discount of 15 per cent over the NAV
 isi tarah kai anya closed-and mutual pha fund chhot ke saath mil rahe hai
 The basic principle of investing profit is buying at a low price and selling at a high price
 crisil research ke senior diarector jiju vidyadharan kehete hai, ''share bazaaron main closed-anded fund kii trading kam hoti he, isliye ye baari chhot ke saath uplabdh hote hai
 But these exemptions and other benefits vary according to the maturity period and tax
 '' visheshgyon kaa kahana he ki behatar laabh ke liye closed-anded fund acha avasar dete hai
 Brijesh Dalmia, director, Dalmia Advisory Services, says, "buying closed-ended funds from the secondary market and holding it to maturity for additional benefits is not a bad idea
 ''ve kehete hai, ''lekin niveshak ko di ja rahi chhot or yojana kii bachi hui avadhi ko dhyaan main rakhana chahie
 "his advice is that the investor should keep it till maturity and its duration is over
" jo kharidaar ise kuch din ke antaraal par bechney kaa iraadaa rakhte hai, unhen chhot ke saath hi bechnaa pad saktaa he
 Suresh Sadagopan, founder of Ladder 7 Financial Advisories, says, "investors should take into consideration the level of risk involved when taking closed-ended funds and think if they are ready to take that risk
" 
 
 agar haa to hi is tarah kii yojanaon main paisa lagaaein or paripakvata kii avadhi tak usase jude rahen taaki zyada munafa ho
 Investors should also keep the following points in mind: Past performance of the project: Mutual fund benefits are directly linked to different schemes
 bhale hi aap secondary bazaar se mutual pha fund kharidte hai lekin paripakvata par milane vaala phayda enevi par aadhaarit hota he
 For example, if you have a fund from the secondary market for Rs
 12
 main kharidte hai or acha pradarshan na hone ke kaaran paripakvata ke samay enevi 11 ru
 If it remains, then its profit will be based on the current value of NAV with maturity
 daalamia kehete hai, ''mahatvapurn yah he ki fund kaa pichhlaa pradarshan kaisaa rahaa he
 It should be the same or better than other funds
 '' unki salaah he kiaise fund main paisa nahin lagaana chahie jinka pradarshan acha na rahaa ho, bhale hi unamem zyada chhot di ja rahi ho
 Liquidity: Experts believe that investors should not withdraw their money in between
 sadgopan kehete hai, ''acha laabh paane ke liye niveshak ko paripakvata kii avadhi tak bane rahanaa chahie
 "the rule of supply and demand in the market determines the price
 agar aapako apana paisa nikaalane kii jarurat he to share bazaar ke raste ke sivaa isse baahar nikalne kaa koi or rasta nahin he
 In such a situation, you may have to sell the funds in a hurry and then obviously you will have to suffer losses
 taxh ek saal se kam avadhi main share main nivesh par aapako milane vaale puunjigat laabh par 15 pratishat kii dar se alpavadhi tex dena hota he or ek saal se adhik avadhi ke nivesh ke puunjigat laabh par 10 pratishat kii dar se dderghaavadhi tex dena hota he
 Keeping in mind the savings in tax, you should invest in a mutual fund that has a maturity of more than one year to get better benefits
 rin koshon ke maamle main niveshak ko zyada saavdhaan rahane kii jarurat hoti he kyonki teen saal se kam avadhi ke nivesh se milane vaale laabh par alpavadhi tex lagata he jo vaiyaktik tex ke daayre main aata he
 For example if you invest Rs 10,000 in debt funds before three years
 kaa puunjigat laabh pate hai to yah laabh aapaki kul aay main jud jayega or phir aapako apane us slab ke anusaar tex dena hoga
 But if you keep it with you for more than three years, you will benefit more, especially in the higher slab of tax because long-term capital gains tax in debt funds is 20 percent
 nishkarshanihsandeh, chhot ke saath closed-anded fundon ko khareednaa nivesh kaa acha vikalp ho saktaa he lekin aise maukey kii talash karnaa aasaan kaam nahin he
 There are many closed-ended schemes listed in the stock market which are of different types such as mid cap, small cap and thematic
 vidyadharan kehete hai, ''sahi chhot ke saath is tarah ke kosh kii pahchaan karnaa aasaan nahin dikhataa
 After investing, you should remain in the fund till maturity
 jaldi baahar nikalne ke liye aapako bazaar main chhot ke saath ise bechnaa pad saktaa he
 "they say that retail investors should invest in open-ended or closed-ended mutual fund funds over a long-term period, only then they can get good returns, rather than taking immediate benefits
" nivesh se pehle dhyaan rakhenjokhimsoch len ki aap jis yojana main paisa laga rahe hai, usamen jokhim uthaane ko taiyaar hampradarshanapaka ritern fund ke pradarshan par nirbhar he lihaaja behatar fund main hi paise lagaayentaraltaparipakvata se pehle hadabadi main fund bechney par nuksaan hota he
 So be sure to stay in the fund till maturity
 By taxing, your profit is reduced, so invest in a fund that matures after one year
 By investing equal amount in an open-ended or close-end fund, in ideal circumstances, the money will be given to the retail investors
 Should be applied

 For Naya Khoon, Yoongandharayan and Avantilal were writing long provocative articles on the topics of the world with Gupt, writing their long poems, and completing their incomplete poems in tin boxes

 Muktibodh was surprised to see that the sixth decade Hindi poem titled as the new poem is becoming aesthetically beautiful by cutting down the fundamentally leftist tendency of Tara Saptak
 prasiddh kavi or muktibodh ke anany mitra pramod verma ne gajanan madhav muktibodh naamak apane niabandh main likhaa he ki “aisa to chhayavaad ke jamaane main bhi nahin hua tha
 So is all this being done to keep their newly independent country under the grip of international capitalism

 Naming this changed trend as the literary arm of the political cold war, Muktibodh came out in the open field to fight with the opponents

 They were underlining poets whose poetry had a political tone disguised or directly present

 ” yah itihaas, kahana na hoga, narmada kii subah ke madhyam se likhaa ja rahaa tha jise agyeya ne hijac kar liya
 The sixth-century poem was being beautified by presenting the original left-wing trend of Tar Saptak as a new poem, an attempt to curb this aesthetic trend on the morning of Narmada
 bich main muktibonji ke suputr ramesh muktibodh ne mujhe soochna di thi ki ve narmada kii subah kaa prakaashan karnaa chaahate hai
 Don't know what happened to that idea? (kanti Kumar Jain is the author of Mahakuru Muktibodh: Stairs of Jumma Tank, but) pakistan ne mumbai hamalon par die gaye sabooton se pallaa jhaadte hue aarope lagaaya he ki bharat jang chahta he
 Pakistan described these evidences as not believable
 pakistan ko in sabooton ko thukaraane main sirf 24 ghante lage
 Pakistan also objected to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's statement in which he said that terrorism has become the official policy of Pakistan
 pakistani videsh sachiv salmaan bashir ne kaha ki manmohan kaa bayaan khatarnaak he
 Pakistan's overthrow of evidence was quite dramatic
 pakistan akhbaar da nesan ne bharosemand sutron ke hawaale se khabar di ki bharat ne jo saboot die hai, ve naakaafi hai

 patr ne kai buki se is silsile main baatcheet kii
 a big bookie said on condition of anonymity that BJP will get 5-6 seats in Delhi and Aam Aadmi Party can get 1-2 seats
 do dinon pehle unhone kaha tha ki aam aadmi party ko 2-3 siten mil sakati hai
 Making a prediction for the BJP in the Lok Sabha elections, Bookie said that it could get 231 to 233 seats
 congress ke bare main uskaa kahana he ki party ko 71-73 siten mil sakati hai
 The Aam Aadmi Party can get 5-6 seats across the country
 buki ne bataaya ki iskaa matlab yah hua ki agar koi bijepi par 1,000 rupee kaa yah satta lagaataa he ki party ko 231 siten nahin milengi or agar party vastav main 230 yaa kuch kam siten jitati he to use 1,000 rupee milenge
 Similarly, if someone bets that BJP will win 233 seats or more, then that person will get Rs 1,000
 lekin agar aisa nahin hua to uskaa paisa jabt ho jayega
 For the PM candidate, the bookie said that by Wednesday or Thursday morning, if someone will put a lakh rupees on Modi and if he wins, the bettor will get Rs 40,000

 On Tuesday, BSP President Mayawati announced that she will not be part of the alliance formed with Akhilesh Yadav's Samajwadi Party and RLD in the upcoming by-elections in Uttar Pradesh and her party will contest it alone
 mayawati ne aarope lagaaya ki akhilesh yadav apni jati ke vot bispi ke ummidavaaron ko nahin dilava paae, yani akhilesh vot transfar karwaane main naakaam rahe
 After examining the data of the India Today Axis My India post poll survey, the India Today Data Intelligence Unit found that the allegations are false
 loksabhaa chunaav se pehle bane is gathbandhan main darasal phayda to mayawati ko hi pahunchaa, samaajawaadee party ko nahin, kyonki yadavon ne ekajute hokar bispi ko vot daalaa lekin daliton ne samaajawaadee party ke liye aisi ekajutata nahin dikhaai
 Yadav-united vote banks, Dalits and Muslims together constitute 49 percent of Uttar Pradesh
 india today exis maay india post pole survey se pataa chalaa he ki 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main daliton kii tulana main yadav or musalamaanon ne gathbandhan ke prati apni patibaddhta dikhaai
 In Uttar Pradesh, Dalit votes are divided into two categories - Jatav and non-jatav
 jahaan jatav dalit bispi ko samarthan dete rahe hai, vahiin gaiyr jatav daliton ne 2014 ke chunaavon se hi party se duuri bana lee thi
 Of the yadav-dalit-muslim communities, 10 percent are non-jatavs, now the SP-BSP alliance has 39 percent vote bank
 survey ne yah bhi saaf kiya jahaan 72 pratishat yadavon ne gathbandhan ko vot diya, vahiin 74 pratishat jatav daliton ne gathbandhan ko chunaa
 At the same time, the people of the Dalit community seem somewhat ahead on the question of voting for the BJP
 20 pratishat yadav, 21 pratishat jatav daliton ne bijepi ko chunaa
 Of the non-jatavs, 60 percent voted for the BJP and 30 percent for the alliance
 exis maay india kaa survey ye bhi bataata he ki gaiyr jatav daliton ko apni taraf laane ke liye bhaajapa kii kalyankari skiimon kaa bada yogadan tha
 Schemes such as free gas connections, construction of toilets and housing for poor women attracted the non-jatav vote bank
 siton main bhi basapa aage2014 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main mayawati ke haath kuch nahin laga tha
 5 years ago, the BSP could not win a single seat
 vahiin akele ladakar bhi samaajawaadee party ko 5 siten ai thim
 The result of the alliance is that in 2019, the BSP managed to win 10 seats, while the Samajwadi Party remained as it was in 5 seats
 un 5 siton main bhi 2 to mulaayam singh yadav or unke bete akhilesh yadav kii hi thim
 Mayawati may have broken the alliance for whatever reason, but the figures are telling a different story and she has got the most benefit of the alliance with Akhilesh

 chunavi mausam main aarope-pratyarope kii raajnneeti jor par he
 From rallies to road-shows
 gali-muhalle se lekar torch padayatra tak
 All the leaders are just engaged in this juga that in some way the maximum vote of the public in their account
 is chunavi mausam main netaaon kaa ek-duusare par tanj kasne se lekar unke bhaashan tak har ek mudde par janata kii najar he
 The election this time, along with the seat and vote among the people, is setting a style trend for politics as well
 bharat main kuch netaa aise bhi hai jo logo ke bich apni raajnneeti ke alaava apane style or dressing sens ko lekar bhi mashhoor hai
 So let's know who are the stylish leaders of Indian politics
 1
 Narendra Modi: If you are getting a stylish leader of Indian politics on the basis of dress, then the first name will be of the Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi
 modi kii dressing sens he wo tarif ke kaabil he
 Which also fits them a lot
 linene chudeedaar ke saath khaadi ke half sleeve vaale kurte to unki pahchaan kaa hissaa hai
 Apart from this, jackets of different colors on Khadi kurtas add to the elegance of this dress
 vibhinn rango ke kurta se lekar jacket or suut tak narendra modi har ek kapade main kamaal ke lagate he
 During Barack Obama's visit to India, he wore a suit in which his name was written which became a topic of discussion for the Indian media
 suut kii tarah apane dressing or style sens ko lekar bhi modi bahut baar charchaa kaa vishay bane hai
 His dressing style has played an important role in the journey from Narendra Modi to Namo brand
 2
 Shashi Tharoor: Shashi Tharoor is one of the fashionable leaders of India
 styl or raajnneeti ke mail shashi tharur main dekhne ko miltaa he
 Like his rhetoric, he is also known for his fashion style among the people
 tharur logon par apni dressing kii chhap chhodane main peeche nahin rahete or apane pahanaave ke liye jane jate hai jo unhe or netao se alag karata he
 Tharoor is mostly seen in bright colored kurtas and pajamas or trousers
 par tharur ke paas dheron stylish suut or paraanparik mundu or kurte bhi he jo tharur khaas maukey par pahante hai
 3
 vasundhara rajehrajasthan kii purv mukhyamantri hone ke alaava vasundhara raaje ek stylish netaa bhi hai
 Being from the royal family, her dress has been a majestic one
 vah apni diziner saadiyon or jevar ke liye jaani jaati hai
 4
 umr abdullahrajasi thaath or shahi khun umr abdulla kii pahchaan he jo unke pahanaave main bhi saaf taur par jhalkata he
 a collection of classy sherwanis, shoots and branded watches near Omar Abdullah, known among the people for his elegance, shows that apart from politics, he also has a good sense of fashion which is seen in his dress from time to time
 is
 5
 Jyotiraditya Scindia: People love Jotiraditya Scindia's attire, who carries the simple look with style
 desh ke jane-maane shahi khandaan se taalluk rakhane vaale sindhiya apane dressing style ko lekar logo ke bich kaaphi charchaa main hai
 Expensive clocks, silver brass and expensive pens reflect her style statement
 6
 Sachin Pilot: Considered one of the best looking and handsome politicians in the country, Sachin Pilot is one of the most well dressed and stylish young politicians
 sachin payalat ko zyaadaatar safed kurte-pajame main dekha jaataa he, uske alaava wo cazual shart bhi pahante hai
 Rimless goggles and branded watches complete her simple look
 kehete hai ki film paa main abhishek bachchan ne unako luk ko copy karne kii koshish kii thi

 smriti iranisechhote parde kii tulsi ke naam se jane-jane vaali kendriya kapadaa mantri smriti irani chote parde par stylish bahu ke naam se charchit to thi hin par raajnneeti main aane ke baad bhi apane tikhe bhaashan ke saath-saath apni simpal style or pahanaave ke liye logo ke bich kaaphi mashhoor rahi hai
 Smriti always wears handloom saris and sometimes matching accessories
 (diksha priyadarshi itmi kii chaatr hai or india today main prashikshu hai)*** If Lalu Prasad Yadav is a victim of Mughalate then the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) could not understand the writings written on the walls
 bihar chunaav 2010 main sabase badi safalataa gaatha likhane vaali bhaajapa ko to maano bin maangi muraad mil gai
 He got more seats than he had expected
 pehle, uske netaa kah rahe the, ''ham kuch siten jeetenge, kuch haarenge
 Everyone felt that the BJP would once again be forced to remain in the shadow of the big party JD (U)
 lekin party ne apane 102 ummidavaaron main se 91 ko jita kar sabko chaunkaa diya
 It got 36 more seats this time than 55 seats in 2005
 sach to yah he ki itane bade paimaane par jeet se khud party ke netaa bhi chakit hai
 BJP did not know this
 lihaaja use parinaam par aadhikarik pratikriya vyakt karne main vakt lag gaya
 Not surprisingly, he last called a press conference in his Patna office
 us vakt lalu or lojpa ke ramvilas paswan media ke aakhri sawaal kaa jawaab de rahe the
 The reason for this delay is probably Sushil Kumar Modi & c
 pi
 It may have occurred in bringing Thakur along
 vaise donon netaaon ne muskuraakar saath-saath photo jarur khinchvaae
 How did BJP do this amazing thing? Though Modi termed it a "positive vote", there are several reasons behind the saffron party's success - from a successful mix of the expected opposition and the NDA votes to the better management at the ground level
 iske alaava, nirvachan kshetron ke parisemen ne bhi apni bhoomika nibhaai
 Due to this, where there was a sufficient number of forward castes in 52 constituencies in the last assembly elections, this time the number of such areas increased to 72
 agadon ne congress ke saath jane se inkaar kar diya or bhaajapa ko samarthan jari rakhaa
 Apart from this, one reason for the better result is that only BJP candidates were considered better among the available options
 mahatvapurn baat yah he ki bhale hi bhaajapa or jad (you), donon ise rajg kii jeet bataa rahe hon or ek-duusare ko dhanyavad de rahe hon lekin unhone apni safalataa gaatha kaa bakhaan karne ke liye alag-alag samvaadadaata sammelan yojit kiya
 This led many to think that this was the beginning of proving its edge among the alliance partners
 asal main bhagava party ne kareeb 90 fisadi safalataa hasil karke 141 main 115 siten hasil karne vaale jad (you) kii 81
 56 per cent did better than success
 ab sandarbh ke bindu badal gaye hai
 The success of the BJP proves that both the partners transferred the votes to each other very well
 lalu or paswan is tarah kaa sahyog karne main spasht rup se vifal rahe
 Since becoming Chief Minister, Nitish Kumar has created a strong social base by creating a unique combination of the most backward castes (ebcs), Muslims and Mahadalits
 duusari ore bhaajapa ne vyapaaree or agadi jatiyon ke apane paaramparik vot bank ko bakhubi banaae rakhaa he jabaki vipaksh ne-congress or rajd-lojpa ke alag-alag ladane kii vajah se-alag-alag saamaajik samoohon ke logon kaa pratinidhitiv kiya
 The grand victory of the two parties cannot be seen separately
 isse yah sabit hota he ki matadaataaon ke bich rajg ko kaaphi sweekaaryata hasil he
 However, Nitish Kumar did not conduct any joint election campaign with many prominent BJP leaders, including LK Advani
 shaayad arun jetali bhaajapa ke ekmaatr bade rashtriya netaa the jinke saath nitish prachaar ko nikle the
 Though a large section of the forward was not happy with Nitish Kumar, he voted for the BJP and its partner
 bhaajapa unhen congress se zyada behatar lagi
 Initially, the Congress was expected, but it slowly came to an end
 isi prakaar, lalu agadon ke liye 10 fisadi aarakshan kaa vaada karne ke baavjood vishwaas nahin jamaa paae
 These results are particularly important for JD (U) as in the past Nitish Kumar enjoyed more electoral benefits than BJP
 is baar sthiti palat gai
 This is evident from the record: JD (U) 's vote percentage in the state increased almost four times in the 2009 general election after the 2000 assembly elections while the BJP fell
 bhaajapa 2009 ke aam chunaav main keval 13
 Only 93 percent of the votes were collected, which was 18 against its national average
 8 se bhi kam tha
 But in 2010, the party came back to expand its base
 vidhansabha chunaav se pehle bhaajapa ko aisi party ke rup main dekha ja rahaa tha, jo raajnneetik laabh ke liye nitish kumaar kii sahyogi bhoomika nibhaane ke liye taiyaar he
 Many believed that after the defeats in the 2004 and 2009 general elections, the central leadership of the BJP started thinking of Nitish as a ladder to reach the center in future
 bhaajapa ne ateet main gathbandhan ko banaae rakhane kii khatir narendra modi ko chunaav prachaar se dur rakhane se lekar nitish sarkaar ko alpsankhyak samarthak upaay lagu karne tak sab kuch karne diya
 These election results have given rise to a second Modi in the BJP - Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi, who is the face of the party in the state
 lagata he ki ab unka kad kaaphi ooncha ho gaya he
 Incidentally, Modi was being publicly targeted within and outside the party
 unhen aise vyakti ke rup main pesh kiya ja rahaa tha jo nitish ke saamne praayah jhuk jate hai
 But he was working on an inclusive agenda with great intelligence, which earlier leaders of BJP could not do
 ab unki party ke paas misaal he, jisase sabit hota he ki kaise naram hindutv kii jagah madhyamargi, samaveshi raajnneeti se zyada chunavi laabh miltaa he
 The party may also get an edge in national politics with this unexpected success
 modi kaa kahana he, ''yah pragati or vikaas ke liye jeet he
 These results have dispelled the notion that some sections do not vote for us
 yahaan tak ki alpsankhyakon ne bhi bhaajapa kaa samarthan kiya
 "so far, the hallmark of this NDA success in Bihar has been that the BJP has shown great generosity in incorporating Nitish's pro-minority agenda
" shaayad party ko lagata tha ki nitish ko bhaajapa kii jarurat ho na ho, use unki zyada jarurat he
 The idea behind this was mainly that Nitish could achieve a simple majority on his own
 unhone akele dam 115 siten jeet kar aisa kar dikhaaya-yah vidhansabha main bahumat se maatr saat kam he
 But the good thing for the BJP in Bihar is that it now has equal status
 ab is utsahjanak nattejey ke baad donon saajheedaaron ke rishton ko dekhnaa dilachasp hoga
 On the other hand Lalu's base has been shattered
 spasht rup se yah unki ab tak kii sabase karaari haar he, yah 2005 main party kii haar se bhi zyada karaari he
 Both his wife and former Chief Minister Rabri Devi lost from the spot, indicating Lalu's poor performance
 in parinaamon se yah bhi sabit hota he ki rajg ne 2009 ke aam chunaav ke baad se apni sthiti or majboot kar lee he
 It had then won 32 seats out of 40
 bihar kii raajnneeti main lalu or paswan alag-thalag pad gaye hai, or ab ve mahaj apane samudaay ke netaa banakar rah gaye hai
 While the RJD got 22 seats, the LJP had to settle for only three
 lalu or paswan ab phir paanch saal ke liye bihar kii satta se dur ho gaye hai
 His downfall at the center has further intensified his downfall
 ve rashtriya raajnneeti main bhi apana mahatv kho rahe hai
 On the other hand, the Congress was hoping to play the role of the main opposition
 lekin karaari haar kii vajah se-use keval chaar siten milin-uski sari ummiido par pani phir gaya
 The largest section of minorities is clearly mobilized behind the NDA; Similarly, the Mahdalit and the most backward castes are also its supporters
 vikaas ke sanket se bhi bihar ke log dharm or jati se pare jaakar vikaas ko vot dene ke liye prerit hue
 Firstly, Nitish's appeal to various social and economic classes of the state was enhanced by the smooth and smooth roads
 pradesh main kanoon or vyavastha tathaa swasthya seva kii apekshaakrit behatar sthiti se unhen chunaav main badhat hasil hui
 Nitish had to start a long journey, because he has to go much further
 bihar ne nitish kii shandaar jeet ke saath hi vikaas kii ghutti pi lee he
 The state has finally joined the mainstream of India's development
 bihar bhassle hi abhi puri tarah chamachama nahin rahaa ho par uski sambhaavna ko nakaara nahin ja saktaa
 Targeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the Lalit Modi case, the Congress accused him that he was playing 'raj Dharma' and not 'raj Dharma' by saving Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj and Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje
 raaje or swaraj ko hataane kii congress kii maang ko doharaate hue party pravaktaa ajay kumaar ne yahaan samvaadadaataaon se kaha, 'pradhanmantri ko 'lalit dharm' yaa 'raaje dharm' nahin rajdharm kaa paalan karnaa chahie
 ' pradhanmantri kii aalochana karte hue kumaar ne kaha ki loksabhaa chunaavon ke dauraan kiye gaye apane vaade ke baad bhrashtachar or kalaadhan ke mudde par unki pratikriya 'behad niraashajanak' he
 He alleged that instead of taking action on these issues, Modi, who has black money, has become his mentor
 ' Kumar's remarks came against the backdrop of bjp's central leadership coming forward in defense of Raje after not voicing support for a few days
 tippaniyan However, the Rajasthan BJP has rejected all the allegations leveled against them, saying that the documents that Raje signed in support of the immigration application of former IPL chief Lalit Modi did not produce it in any court
 haalanki, congress pravaktaa ne daleel di ki lalit modi ke avrajan aavedan kaa gupt rup se samarthan kar raaje ne 'raashtra-virdohi' kaam kiya he
 This, he claimed, has exposed the bjp's 'pseudo nationalism'

 kumaar kii yah tippanee kuch dinon tak samarthan main aawaaj nahin uthne ke baad bhaajapa kendriya netritv ke raaje ke bachaav main aage aane kii prishthbhumi main ai he
 The comments haalanki, rajasthan bhaajapa ne un par lage sabhi aaropon ko yah kehete hue khaarij kiya he ki ipel ke purv pramukh lalit modi ke avrajan aavedan ke samarthan main jis dastavej par raaje ne dastakhat kiya use unhone kisi adaalat main pesh nahin kiya
 However, the Congress spokesperson contended that Raje has acted 'anti-national' by secretly supporting Lalit Modi's immigration application
 unhone daawa kiya isse bhaajapa kaa 'chhadam rashtrawaad' ujagar ho gaya he

 The Supreme Court has reserved its decision on reconsideration petitions on its order to dilute the provisions of SC / ST law
 centre sarkaar va anya ne 20 march 2018 ke aadesh par phir se vichaar karne ke liye punarvichaar yachika daakhil kii thi
 The Supreme Court will examine the SC / ST Prevention of Atrocities (amendment) Act 2018 only after deciding on a reconsideration petition
 supreme court ke aadesh ko palatney ke liye centre dwaara yah kanoon laayaa gaya tha
 Stringent provisions were again retained under this new law
 is sanshodhan ko bhi supreme court main chunauti di gai he
 The Supreme Court had issued guidelines expressing concern over the misuse of SC-ST law in the judgment on March 20
 supreme court ne kaha tha ki essi-asti atyaachaar nirodhak kanoon main shikaayat milane ke baad turant maamla darj nahin hoga
 The DSP will first investigate the complaint to find out if the case is false or malicious
 iske alaava is kanoon main exiaar darj hone ke baad abhiyukt ko turant giraftaar nahin kiya jayega
 The court had said that ssp's approval will be taken before the arrest of a competent officer and a normal person before the arrest of a government employee
 itnaa hi nahin court ne abhiyukt kii agrim jamaanat kaa bhi rasta khol diya tha
 After this, the government brought the new SC-ST amendment law in 2018
 vakil prithviraj chouhan or priya sharma ne supreme court main yachika daakhil kii he
 The petition filed in the Supreme Court said that the order of March 20 of the Supreme Court should be implemented
 essi-asti sanshodhan ke madhyam se jode gaye nae kanoon 2018 main nae praavdhaan 18 a ke lagu hone se phir daliton ko sataane ke maamle main tatkaal giraftaar hogi or agrim jamaanat bhi nahin mil paaegi
 The petition calls for the new law to be declared unconstitutional
 essi-asti sanshodhan kanoon 2018 ko loksabhaa or rajyasabha ne paas kar diya tha or ise notiphoi kar diya gaya he
 This decision of the Supreme Court was followed by a nationwide protest
 jiske baad sarkaar ne kanoon ko purvavat rup main laane ke liye essi-asti sanshodhan bill sansad main pesh kiya tha or donon sadanon se bill paas hone ke baad ise raashtrapati ke paas manjuuri ke liye bheja gaya tha
 The amendment law came into effect after the President's approval
 is sanshodhan ke jariye essi asti atyaachaar nirodhak kanoon main dhara 18 e jodi gai he jo kahati he ki is kanoon kaa ulanghan karne vaale ke khilaaf exiaar darj karne se pehle praarambhik jaanch kii jarurat nahin he or na hi jaanch adhikari ko giraftaar karne se pehle kisi se ijaajat lene kii jarurat he
 The amended law also states that the accused committing an offense under this law will not get the benefit of the provision of anticipatory bail (crpc Section 438)
 yani agrim jamaanat nahin milegi
 In the amended law it is clearly stated that the violation of this law will follow the procedure given in the law and will not get anticipatory bail
 saaf he ki ab supreme court ke aadesh se bilkul ulat hoga
 Like earlier, an FIR will be registered as soon as a complaint is received in this law
 abhiyukt kii giraftaar hogi or abhiyukt ko agrim jamaanat nahin milegi yani jail janaa hoga

 karnataka main lingayat ko alag dharm kaa darja dena kya banegaa mudda?surveykshan main ek sawaal par logon ke jawaab behad dilachasp hai
 When people were asked whether the BJP or its alliance formed its governments in Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Tripura, Nagaland and Meghalaya recently, do you think the BJP will benefit from these results in Karnataka? More than half of the people answered "yes" to this question
 zyaadaatar logon kii raay ek jaisi thi or unka maananaa he ki jis tarah bijepi ne tamaam rajyon main safalataa pai he karnataka vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi ko uskaa phayda milegaa
 The survey constitutes 53% of the population who believe so
 mjedaar yah he ki 20 % logon ko is bare main kuch jaankaree nahin he yaa jawaab nahin de paae
 This number is just 7% more than those who think that the BJP will not get any benefit from the success of BJP and its alliance in other states
 27% ko is baat kaa nishchit bharosa he
 No one is getting majority in Karnataka, congress-bjp will get so many seats, however, how the BJP will form the government is a big question

 According to the survey, if the results are received today, the Congress is likely to get 90-101 seats in Karnataka and 78-86 seats for the BJP
 vahiin jedies ko 34-43 seat mil sakati he
 Let us know that the seats of JDS can be like this if it is aligned with BSP before the election
 anya ke khate main bhi 4-7 siten aa sakati hai
 However, the gap between Congress and BJP is very less

 supreme court ke chaar jajon kaa media ke saamne aana nihaayat aswabhaavik ghatana he
 The four judges have accused the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of neglecting the superiors in the division of work
 nyaaypalika or loktantr ke jis str par ye aarope laga he vah kaaphi gambhir he or isse desh kii sabase badi adaalat ke bheetar ke ghatnakram par aam aadmi kayaas lagane laga he, uski kalpanaashakti, jo hua usase kai guna kharaab chitra bana rahi he
 Sorting of this mist is necessary
 jajon ke aachaar vichaar ke liye supreme court ne 7 may, 1997 ko restatement of vailu of juditial life naamak charter sweekaar kiya
 Later it was also implemented in all the High Courts
 is charter ke tamaam kaayadon main ek ye bhi tha ki jaj media ke saamne aakar apni raay nahin rakhenge, vah faisle ke jariye bolegaa
 At the same time, the judge will not do any such thing which spoils the perception of the people towards the judiciary
 12 janvari ko charter ke in donon praavdhaanon kaa ghor ulanghan hua
 If the judges have come in front of the media, then they will also have to face the questions of the media, which a journalist might never have dared to do to a judge in his life
 supreme court ke jaj aalaa darje ke kanoonvid hote hai
 Patience and emotional perseverance are always expected to be maintained and if the circumstances are adverse then this expectation is further increased
 lekin 12 janvari ko aisa nahin hua
 The general administration of the court was beset with questions of dissatisfaction with the Chief Justice
 supreme court main sabhi nyaayadhish baraabar kii yogyata vaale hote hai
 But there too, if the tussle between the distribution of important and less important cases indicates negative
 aarope lagane vaale jaj agar ye kehete hai ki pradhan nyaayadhish first amang icwals, he to phir unhen mukademon ke kam or zyada mahatvapurn hone kii shikaayat nahin kerani chahie
 Which case will run in which court is undeniably a monopoly of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court
 vah master of roster hota he
 The four judges have challenged it and said to establish democracy in it
 lekin loktantr itnaa bhi nahin failana chahie ki anushaasan hi taar-taar ho jaae
 The judges in the media have left the decision in the press conference on the public
 to ab janata kii baat-supreme court se koi faisla hota he to aam janata jaj kaa naam baad main dekhati he pehle vah sabase badi adaalat par bharosa karti he
 The public does not see which judge has pronounced this decision
 falaan mudda zyada mahatv kaa tha isliye is par faisla duusari adaalat ko sunaanaa chahie tha
 The administrative powers of the Chief Justice are paramount and if the powers are given the color of democracy, then more institutions of the country will come into dispute
 sena or police main agar loktantr kii aawaaj uthi to desh mushkil main pad jayega
 Any system works in a discipline and it should not crack
 kuch log ye daleel de rahe hai ki sarkaar main bhi aisi aawaaj uthni chahie to unako bataa den ki sarkaar ke mukhiya ke paas aise logon ko baahar kaa rasta dikhaane kaa upaay hota he or sarkaar ko har paanch saal main baahar kaa rasta dikhaane kaa vikalp janata ke paas hota he
 But there is no such option in the judiciary, its biggest thing is its prestige and if the prestige goes, the entire judiciary will be done, big or small will not survive

 college main ladakiyon kii dress code ko lekar jhagada purana he
 They are often told not to wear jeans, do not wear western clothes, wear traditional clothes, but a new wonder is being seen in Firozabad, UP
 vahaan esaaarake degree college ne burqe par pabandi laga di he
 a video of the college has surfaced in which the principal is seen chasing the students who came in the burqa with the stick
 in chaatraon kaa kahana he ki unase kaha ja rahaa he, wo bas stop par burka utaar kar college main daakhil hon
 Wearing a burqa can be against the dress code of a college
 ise aurat kii aazaadee ke bhi khilaaf mana ja saktaa he
 It can also be called a sign of backwardness but it is not against any law of the country
 philhal yah chaunkaane vaala he ki college ke prisimple chadi lekar burka pahanane vaali ladakiyon ko kis tarah dutkaar ke college se bhaga rahe hai
 Prabhaskar Rai, Principal of AISK Degree College, says that this rule is outdated that boys have to come in uniform, since admissions were still going on, it was not strictly followed
 ab admician proces puraa ho gaya he isliye 11 taarikh ke baad se bina parichay patr or bina uniform ke pravesh kar diya gaya he
 He said, burqa does not come under dress
 dress main jo college dwaara nirdhaarit dress he use hi anumati di jaaegi
 Police is under guard in the college
 police burka pahanane vaali ladakiyon se kah rahi he ki wo baahar bas stand par jaakar burka utaar kar aae
 It is not allowed to take off the burqa inside the class
 tamaam burka vaali ladakiyon kaa kahana he ki vah hameshaa burka main college aati hai, lekin achaanak yah niyam lagu kar diya gaya

 Before his premature death in October 2011, Steve Jobs, an outstanding CEO who made Apple the world's first $ 1 trillion company, went to college for just six months to graduate
 duniya ke duusare sabase amir or microsoft ke sansthaapak bill gates ne harvard main isse thodaa-sa zyada vakt guzaara tha
 In our country, veteran businessman Dhirubhai Ambani did not even get a chance to enroll in any university
 ve bharat ke sabase amir shaks bane
 Gautam Adani also left college midway and became a billionaire like Ambani
 behad kaamyaab udhyamiyon ke aise kai or bhi udhaaharan hai jinhone vishvavidhyalay kii padhai bich main hi chhod di thi
 Unfortunately, most people are not an exception, nor are they extremely talented, and they also lack entrepreneurial ability
 adhiktar logon ke liye kisi vishvavidhyalay kii acchhee shiksha hi safalataa kaa passport hoti he
 You may ask what is the benefit of post graduate degrees (MA, msc, mpom and mphil, phd) that cannot equip them with professional qualifications like a MBA? The answer is, it has many advantages
 yahi vajah he ki india today ne kala, vaanijya or vigyaan main post graduate degree karaane vaale bharat ke vishvavidhyalayon kii gunvattta aankane ke liye 2010 main ek khaas vishvavidhyalay survey or ranking karaane kaa faisla kiya
 In its third edition, the India today-nielsen survey ranks India's top 50 universities (out of 160 surveyed)
 hamaare hathonhaath liye jane vaale college survey kii tarah hi yah ranking bhi deshbhar main chaatro, abhibhavakon or shiksha jagat se jude logon ke liye jaadui paimaane kii tarah ubharkar saamne ai he
 For the first time this year, we are separately giving the list of the five fastest emerging and five largest backward
 hamane kshetra ke hisaab se bhi paanch sheersh vishvavidhyalayon kii suchi di he
 University graduation degrees in the developed economies of the West are generally enough to get a good job
 bharat main grajuation kii degree shaayad hi kabhi aakarshak naukari dilaa paane main paryaapt hoti he
 It is possible that a few well-known colleges of reputed universities are helpful in getting jobs
 lekin aise main postagrajuation kii degree rang dikhaa sakati he
 This is not because studying MA or msc increases the productivity of the prospective employee in the eyes of the prospective employer
 lekin vyakti ke paas atirikt degree uske zyada kaabil hone kii ore ishaara karti he
 American economist Michael Spence has received the Nobel Prize for his ideas
 yahi vajah he ki sheersh rank vaale vishvavidhyalayon ke chaatro ko nichle rank vaale vishvavidhyalayon kii tulana main behatar naukariyaan milti hai
 Not because they have done more or better quality studies, but because they (compared to others) have demonstrated their high potential by taking admission for additional degrees at a top-ranked university
 pratishtha akasar najar nahin aati he or na hi iskaa andaja lagaaya ja saktaa he
 The India Today Survey of Best Universities in partnership with Nielsen has used extensive fieldwork and data to rate India's best universities
 isamen vyaktiparak maapdand (jaise deshbhar ke sheersh shikshavidon kii raay) or vastuparak maapdand (shikshak-chaatr anupaat, karaae jane vaale course aadi) ko shaamil kiya gaya he
 Like 2011, Delhi University is at the top this time
 iske baad banaras hindu vishvavidhyalay, kalakatta vishvavidhyalay or jawaharlal nehru vishvavidhyalay kaa number aata he
 All these universities were also in the top 5 last year
 unke rank main thodaa sa badlaav jarur aayaa he lekin apni pratishtha banane or neeche se upar tak pahunchane main unhone lanbaa safar tay kiya he
 The new name in the top five is that of Aligarh Muslim University (AMU)
 kuch had tak isaki ek vajah yah bhi rahi he ki mumbai, iiessi-bangaleru or pune jaise kuch vishvavidhyalay apni kuch baadhyataaon ke kaaran tathyaparak aankade uplabdh nahin kara sake, jisaki vajah se ve hamaare surveykshan main shaamil nahin ho sake
 But it is also true that AMU coming forward in this way shows that this university is in the struggle to regain its old reputation
 yah sambhav he ki vibhinn vishvavidhyalayon kii rank ko lekar thodi bahut tikaa-tippanee ho lekin iske samooche ruzan par shaayad hi koi sawaal uthayega
 In developed economies, people usually go on to postgraduate degrees only when they have to pursue a career in research or teaching
 bharat main bhi vishvavidhyalayon ke liye bahut saare shikshakon kii jarurat he
 According to Union Human Resource Development Minister Kapil Sibal, India plans to establish 200 new universities by 2017
 maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantri sibbal chaahate hai ki desh main hyskool se vishvavidhyalay jane vaale chaatro ke pratishat ko maujuuda 15 se badhaakar 30 fisadi par pahunchaaya jaae
 Therefore, there is a need to encourage master's degree and phd in India
 nijee kshetra bharat kii vishvavidhyalay stareey pranali ke vistaar main pehle hi mahati bhoomika nibhaa rahe hai
 Further, its role will only increase because the government alone cannot meet the demand for rapidly growing higher education on its own

 Fortunately, we have left that phase behind
 ab desh ke kuch diggaj udyogpati vishvavidhyalayon main nivesh kar rahe hai or unka makasad unhen utkrushtataa ke vaishvik thikaanon main badalanaa he
 Azim Premji University in Bangalore, Shiv Nadar University in Greater Noida and o in Sonepat
 pi
 It is too early for Jindal University to make it to this ranking
 lekin bhavishya unheen kaa he na ki charmarate sarkari vishvavidhyalayon yaa raturaat gaayab ho jane vaale operataron kaa
 There has been a tradition of providing funding to excellent universities on behalf of veteran industrialists in the country

 Often, iits and iims are ranked in the international rankings of the best universities
 vishvavidhyalayon ke bich pratispardhaa se utkrushtataa hasil karne main madad mil sakati he
 If nothing else, such ranking will motivate about 300 universities in India to improve their standard
 or is tarah bharat ko hi phayda hoga
 Approach: How Ranked India Today is the third survey with Nielsen Company to identify India's best universities in arts, science and commerce disciplines
 sirf unheen vishvavidhyalayon ko isamen tarjeeh di gai he jahaan kala, vigyaan or vaanijya main postagraduate corcej karaae jate hai
 This survey does not include those institutions of national importance that specialize in any one field such as engineering, medicine, law or journalism etc
 isi vajah se indian institute of technology (iity), ol india institute of medical sciensej (ames) yaa neshnal institute of technology (enity) ko suchi se baahar rakhaa gaya he
 a formulation consisting of the Perceptual Score (in-depth interviews from academic experts) and Objective Score (factual data provided by universities) was used to find out the rank
 charan 1:visheshgyon ke saath gahan saakshaatkaar kiye gaye taaki adhyayan ke ant main un maanakon kii pushti kii ja sake jin par vishvavidhyalayon kaa akalan kiya janaa he
 These standards include reputation, academic resources, faculty, research publications / projects, infrastructure, placement opportunities, and registration for higher education
 charan 2:surveykshan ke liye vishvavidhyalayon kii suchi praapt karne ke liye desk research kii gai
 Secondary sources such as the Internet, published reports and the Handbook of the Association for Indian Universities were also used
 iske baad 160 se zyada vishvavidhyalayon kii ek samgr suchi taiyaar kii gai
 Step 3: The list of these 160 universities was placed in front of 337 experts (dean, Registrar, Reader and Professor) and asked to rate them based on the declared standards
 in visheshgyon se apane vishvavidhyalay ko reating dene se manaa kiya gaya tha
 They were asked to distribute 100 marks to the universities based on the standards given to them
 har maanak ko atirikt mahatv diya gaya tha jo visheshgyon dwaara die gaye ausat reating ke aadhaar par tay kiya gaya tha
 In this way, the most important standard was given the highest importance and the least important standard was given the least importance
 ahmiyat ke aadhaar par paanch pramukh maanakon ko visheshgyon dwaara di gai reating ke aadhaar par kisi vishvavidhyalay kaa kul avadharanatmak score tay kiya gaya
 a list of the top 75 universities came out at the end of this exercise
 charan 4:in sheersh 75 vishvavidhyalayon se hamane tathyaatmak jaankaree jutai
 Of these, 50 shared their figures with us
 ye aankade buniyadi dhaanche, placement, academik sansaadhan, shodh or prakaashan tathaa faikalti se jude the
 The last ranking process did not include universities that did not provide their figures
 charan 5:charan 3 main visheshgyon kii raay lene ke baad hamane avadharanatmak or tathyaatmak soochna kaa vettege nikaala
 Conceptual scores were given a weightage of 50 percent and factual scores were also given a weightage of 50 percent to get the total score
 in vettege ko aankane ke baad score ko 100 ankon ke aadhaar par soochibaddh kiya gaya
 In this way, the overall picture of each university emerged
 duniya ke sabase taqatvar dekhmericake sathbharatake sambandh achche hote ja rahe hai

 trump ne kaha ki pehle se 50 arab dollar ke vastuon par dandatmak shulk lagu he or 200 arab dollar kaa shulk lagane par vichaar kiya ja rahaa he or ise jald hi lagu kiya ja saktaa he
 Let us tell you that the US had imposed import duty on other Chinese goods worth $ 16 billion last month

 Arbuthnot's order is just like a recommendation for home minister Sajid Javed and the final decision on extradition is to be taken by him
 maalya arbthanot ke is faisle ke khilaaf do hafte ke bheetar aavedan kar saktaa he
 BJP president Amit Shah may claim that this is a victory for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, but the matter is uncertain now, because defeat in a high court is possible
 yahi nahin, maalya ko bhartiya jaj ke saamne pesh karne se pehle ab bhi kai tarah ke afasarshahi or kanoonee adchanon se guzarana hoga
 In his order, Arbhannot said that 'prima facie' case appeared to be that the IDBI Bank's loan given to Mallya's Kingfisher Airlines was misused and lied to bank officials using his influence
 court ne maalya ke is daawey ko bhi thukraa diya ki unka maamla rajnatik he or bharat main unka mukadmaa nishpaksh tareeke se nahin chal paaegaa
 Mallya's claim was also rejected that the system of Indian jails is very poor
 bharat or britain, donon jagahon par kaam kar rahe vakil pramod nair kaa tark he ki maalya ko apil karne ke liye kai avasar milenge, lekin ''magistrate ke court kaa vistrut or suvichaarit nirnay kaaphi prerak sabit ho saktaa he
 "as an immediate process, the UK Home Ministry has confirmed that it has received a court order
" maalya ko apane bachaav main apil ke liye chaar hafte kaa samay diya gaya he, jiske baad grih mantri do maheene main faisla karenge
 He can also appeal to extend this time limit
 pratyrpan aadesh kii pushti hone ke baad vijay maalya pehle hycourt or phir supreme court main bhi apil kar saktaa he
 a senior CBI lawyer, on the condition of anonymity, said that the order of Arbhanot was "just the first of many steps"
 kam se kam tatkaal to bilkul nahin
 "of course if Mallya does not apply for an appeal, he will be extradited within 28 days of the Home Minister's decision, but this cannot be done so easily
" kaarywahi se jude ek kareebi sutara ne bataaya, ''aam chunaav se pehle maalya ko waapas laana ek divaswapn hi he
 Everyone is eyeing criminal proceedings against Mallya and the issue has become a political football, but progress in this case depends on a very slow process of obtaining extradition from Britain
 pichley saal janvari main, bangaluru ke date recovery tribunel ne united brurij holdings limited, jiske maalya ab bhi chairman hai, ko aadesh diya ki vah bhartiya state bank kii aguai vaale 15 bainkon ke consorcium ko 6,203 karod rupye ke karj kii vaapasi kare or vah bhi 11
 With an annual interest of 5 per cent
 ek maheene ke baad karnataka hycourt main ubchael ke kaamkaaj ko sametane ke aadesh par sunwaayee hui
 UBHL told the court that its assets were around Rs 15,000 crore
 kaa he, jo baaki bache 3,500 karod ru
 Enough to repay the entire debt, but many of its assets have been attached by the Enforcement Directorate
 kai bank iske baad tribunel ke paas gaye ki vah idi ko maalya ke asset ko mukt karne kaa aadesh de taaki karj kii vasuuli ho sake
 In October, a tribunal said that banks had the first right over Mallya's property
 lekin idi ne is baat par jor diya ki jab tak aapraadhik maamla chal rahaa he, tab tak kurk property ko nahin bechaa ja saktaa
 Following a recent order by a UK magistrate, SBI chairman Rajnish Kumar said extradition could speed up the debt recovery process
 lekin is maamle se parichit vakil asahmat hai
 a senior lawyer, on the condition of anonymity, said, "if the court agrees to a resolution of settlement under its aegis, it may be the most convenient way to get at least some part of the debt
" agar aisa nahin hota he, to company ke kaamkaaj sametane kii prakriya se hi yah tay ho saktaa he ki bainkon ko kitni rakam mil paaegi
 "the truth at the moment is that either dragging Mallya in the Indian court or recovering some part of the bank's debt is still a long way
" ab dekhnaa yah he ki sarkaar is bhagode aarthik apradhi ke khilaaf koun-sa sakht kadam uthaati he

 The service of this ambulance will be made available 24 hours a day 7 days

 Let me tell you that earlier in Uttar Pradesh also, the Yogi government had taken an important decision to provide medical facilities to cows
 unhone gauvansh chikitsa mobile vine kii shuruyaat kii
 In this sequence, Deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya flagged off five cow dynasty medical mobile vans

 Ambulance for cows started in Jharkhand also
 Earlier in 2015, the ambulance service for cows was started in Jharkhand
 iske liye khaas taur par swami ramdev ranchi aae the
 At that time a businessman RK Aggarwal had arranged 10 such ambulances from his personal fund
 bataa den ki vejharkhand pradeshik gaushala sangh kshadhyaksh bhi hai
 It was also said that when the deaths of cows were discussed in 2016, their lives were saved by these ambulances
 ambulance naa milane se log hue pareshandesh main jahaan insaanon ke liye samay par ambulance nahin milti he, kya vahaan gaayon ke liye mil paaegi
 For some time, there were reports where a man had to walk 12 km in the Kalahandi district of Odisha with his wife's body on the shoulder
 jis aspataal main us mahila kii maut hui thi, vahaan se aspataal ne kathith taur par shav le jane ke liye ambulance muhaiyaa karaane se inkaar kar diya tha
 Apart from this, in a village in Kaushambi, the man had to force his seven-month-old niece's dead body on the shoulder and travel 10 km by bicycle
 peedit parivaar kaa aarope he ki jab sarkari hospital se ambulance maangi gai to unhone 800 rupye maange or ambulance nahin di thi
 At the same time, a 40-year-old man was taken to the hospital 14 km away on his shoulders in Lava village of Dantewada in Chhattisgarh

 ' pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne in aaropon kaa khandan kiya he ki samprag sarkaar kaa rukh aatankwaad par naram he
 The Prime Minister was speaking to reporters after seeing the victims of the blasts here on Friday
 pradhanmantri ne kaha ki ham aatankwaad par naram rukh nahin apana rahe hai
 There is no compromise with terrorism
 unhone kaha ki in kaayartapurna krityon ke liye koi bhi jimmedaar ho, ham prabhavi kadam uthaaenge
 Along with the Prime Minister, Congress President Sonia Gandhi has also gone to Assam to see the victims
 is ghinaune krity ke liye jo bhi jimmedaar hoga, ham is kadaa se kadaa kadam uthaaenge
 When asked about the involvement of other governments, the Prime Minister said that if other governments are involved, we will raise the issue with them as well
 pradhanmantri ne kaha ki jaanchakarta sabhi suraagon par gaur karenge
 It would not be appropriate for them to speak in the context of investigation

 The ideology that has led Narendra Modi to this point and the capital that has helped him in this work, both are slowly asking for their accounts
 ek ko ghar vaapasi chahie, hindu dharm or samskruti kaa paracham chahie, kisi pracheen bharat kii chhuti hui garima chahie, in sabake saath-saath ek ram mandir or bina anuchhed 370 ke, kashmir chahie
 Others want land in the name of development, want loose labor laws, guarantee profits and need a lot of foreign money
 pradhanmantri or unki sarkaar agar vichaardhaara ko kuch din ke liye sthagit bhi kar de to bhi puunji kii maang ko nazarandaaz nahin kar sakati
 The interest rises very fast there
 lekin is nae arthtantr kii maar jhelane vaala is desh kaa garib kisaan or majdoor sirf apane vot par bharosa karata he
 The comments arthniti agar is desh ke garib or pichde hue logon ko maarthi he to raajnneeti unhen bachaati he
 Narendra Modi will have to take care of this
 achche dinon ke jumale se pehle endie kii ek or sarkaar ne feel good or india shining kaa naaraa diya tha- is desh ke garibon ne uski hawa nikaal di
 Lest Narendra Modi ignore this manpower by making the country a superpower
 pehle saal kaa ishaara ye dikh rahaa he or aane vaale varshon main unhen vikaas or raajnneeti ke bich kii is gutthi kaa hal khojna hoga- saamaajik samarasata or aarthik barabari ko saadh kar wo apni raajnneeti ko nai oonchaaiyon tak le ja sakate hai
 But when it stumbles here, the public does not miss showing the street of history to their favorite leaders

 India defeated South Africa by six wickets in the first ODI played in 1992, while in 2006, the hosts defeated the visiting team by 106 runs
 is lihaaj se dekha jaae to is maidan par dakshin africa kaa palada baari he
 India defeated South Africa by 87 runs at the Kingsmead ground in the second Test match of the recently concluded three-test series and were successful in drawing the final and decisive Test match played thereafter

 This is to say that Kangana Ranot's lawyer who covers the secret that false news related to Kangana is being spread these days is diverting the attention of media and people from the truth

 unke anusaar yah mahaj unki chaalen hai jo is mudde ko media trial banaakar bina kisi saboot ke aadhaar par faisla apane haq main sunanaa chaahate hai
 This shows that Kritik Roshanki's team is now lacking in ideas so that they can fight the law
 yah bhi kah sakate hai ki sahi mudde ko jhuthla kar usase sabakaa dhyaan hataane kii yah ek sochi samajhi chaal he
 Advocate Rizwan Siddiqui says, "instead of filing an investigation report, the police is writing a summary report of A, b or C
 main is baat se bhi kaaphi chakit hum ki kis boote par media ne yah khabar chhaapi ki mere clientakanganake paas ek laptop he jisaki demand police ne unase kii he

 haalanki kai jaankaron kaa kahana he ki bharat ke prati unke rukh kaa aankalan karnaa abhi thodi jaldbaaji hogi
 At the same time, former Army Chief of India Bikram Singh, who has known Pakistan's new army chief Bajwa for a long time, has advised him to be cautious
 general bajva ne saal 2007 main congou main sanyukt raashtra ke mishan main brigade commander ke taur par general bikram singh ke adheen kaam kiya tha
 Bikram Singh called Bajwa a 'complete professional' and an 'outstanding performer' military officer
 vah kehete hai ki sanyukt raashtra main unka pradarshan kaaphi saraahneey tha, lekin jab ek sainya adhikari apane desh lautataa he to chizein badal jaati hai
 In the country, they have to work according to national interests
 ' tippaniyan Bikram Singh hoped that Bajwa would be targeted by Pakistan's extremists and not India, as he has said many times publicly
 general singh ne kaha, 'general bajva 10veen kor ke commander rah chuke hai, jo vahaan kii sabase badi kor he
 He is very well aware of his country's policy towards India
 mujhe lagata he ki jahaan tak pakistani sena kii kashmir niti kaa sawaal he, to usamen koi badlaav nahin aane vaala
 However, he added that India will need to be cautious if there is a big change in the Pakistan Army's strategy after the arrival of Qamar Bajwa

 aise main ab dekhnaa yahi he ki vah aane vaale dinon main kis tarah kii surkhiyaan batorate hai
 Bajwa is considered to be a mastermind of the loc cases due to its extensive involvement in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (pok) and northern regions
 aise main ashanka he ki raahil sharif kii tarah vah bhi bharat ke prati sakht rukh apanaae rah sakate hai
 However, many experts say that it is too early to assess his attitude towards India

 dilli ko tii-20 lig 6 main 10 din guzar jane ke baad bhi jeet hasil nahin ho saki he
 The team, which performed brilliantly last year, has lost two matches at its home ground Ferozeshah Kotla Stadium

 This is the fourth consecutive defeat of the hosts while Hyderabad have won the third of four matches
 dilli ne pehle khelte hue 20 overon main aath wicket par 114 ran banaae
 After that it was thought that Hyderabad would easily win but their batsmen made this low-scoring match difficult due to their poor game
 yahi kaaran he ki unhen tamaam prayaason ke baad 20wein over main saat wicket ganvaakar jeet mili
 Fast bowler Dale Steyn, returning David Warner to the pavilion on the fourth ball of the Delhi innings, struck the winning four
 sten nau ranon par naabad rahe jabaki amit mishra ek ahm pari khelte hue 16 ranon par naabad laute
 Mishra hit two fours off 14 balls
 mishra ko main of da match chunaa gaya
 Like Delhi, Hyderabad also did not have a good start
 shahbaaj nadeem ne do ran ke kul yoga par akshat reddy (1) ko ran out karke dilli ko manamafik shuruyaat dilaai lekin iske baad parthiv patel (19) or captain kumaar sangakaara (28) ne duusare wicket ke liye 44 ran jodakar is gam ko kam kiya

 Mishra took eight runs, including a no ball in that over of Morkel, to take the figure to 18 runs from 18 balls until its completion
 duusare chor par thisira perera sirf do gend khelkar apni baari ke intjaar main the
 Famous for playing big shots, Perera had faced only two balls so far
 irfan pathan dwaara phenke gaye 18wein over kii pehali gend par dilli ne mishra par jaanboojh kar wicket kii ore thro kii gai gend ke raste main aane kaa aarope lagaaya lekin ampaire aleem daar ne ise nakaar diya
 After the second ball went empty, Mishra took a run on the third ball and thus Perera returned on strike
 perera ne pathan kii gend ko long aan ke upar se udaane kaa prayaas kiya lekin vah bilkul seemaa rekha par botha ke dwaara lapke gaye
 He could score only two runs
 unka wicket 100 ran ke kul yoga par gira
 Hyderabad were to score 12 runs off the final 12 balls
 mishra or del sten ne ek chauke kii madad se is over main chah ran liye
 Thus Hyderabad needed six runs to win in the final over
 yah over irfan lekar aae
 On the first ball, Stan scored two runs and hit a four off the second ball to ensure his team's victory

 Kedar Jadhav scored the most unbeaten 30 runs while Irfan contributed 23 runs
 warner khaataa bhi nahin khol sake jabaki sahvaag or jayavardhane 12-12 ran hi bana sake
 Manpreet Juneja (15) and Irfan shared a 21-run stand for the fifth wicket, but Mishra caught Juneja at the hands of White for a total of 65 runs
 pathan or jadhav par ab team kaa kul yoga 100 ke paar pahunchane kii jimmedaari thi
 Both tried hard for this but Pathan was dismissed at a total of 95

 Great batsman Sachin Tendulkar, who was playing his last Test match at the Eden Gardens Stadium, was surrounded by silence when he was lbw by Shane Shillingford for a personal total of 10 against the West Indies on Thursday
 darasal, sachin tendulkar kharaab ampiring ke shikaar bane
 West Indies bowler Shillingford's performance was impressive and he left no stone unturned to shake up India's famous batting lineup, but Tendulkar's fate did not materialize and umpire Nigel Long gave him the wrong-footed out
 isamen koi andeh nahin ki shillingford ne sanyas kii ghoshnaa kar chuke tendulkar ko apane 'doosraa' se chakma diya, lekin gend unki jaangh ke upree hisse main lagi thi
 The TV replays seemed like the ball could have gone over his stumps
 tendulkar ne 10 ran banaae or vah acchhee tach main dikh rahe the
 He hit two fours before raising the finger of the umpire
 darshakon ko ek pal yakeen nahin hua ki sachin out ho gaye, lekin jab sach kaa saamana hua, to niraashaa ke bhav unke chehron par dekha ja sakate the
 The audience was expecting a big innings from Sachin
 iske baad darshak pavilion laut rahe sachin ke sammaan main khadey ho gaye
 Sachin bowed his head and returned to the pavilion regretting his stroke selection
 har najar pavilion chor kii ore thi or har najar main sachin kii ballebaaji lambe samay tak nahin dekh paane kaa afsos dikh rahaa tha
 Despite this, the audience greeted this great player with applause
 sachin jab wicket par aae tha, tab kaa najaara isse bilkul ulat tha
 After the fall of Murali Vijay's wicket, as soon as Sachin came on the field to bat, the entire Eden Gardens Stadium was raised
 subah ke satr ke shuruaati 45 minute bharat ke liye thik nahin rahe
 Sachin came on the wicket to support Cheteshwar Pujara after Shikhar Dhawan and Murali were dismissed cheaply
 us samay eden main maujuud lagbhag 40 hajaar darshakon ko maano isi pal kaa intjaar tha
 The audience roared loudly as soon as Sachin came on the wicket
 yah garjana stadium se ek kilometre dur esplaned metro stesan tak sunai di
 The spectators reaching the stadium by metro and buses got excited
 jo darshak stadium ke baahar the, ve samaj gaye ki sachin kaa aagaman ho chukaa he
 Nobody had the grief to lose two wickets for India
 stadium ke pravesh dwaaron par tainaat surakshakarmi logon ko jaldi-jaldi pravesh karne ke liye utsahit kar rahe the
 Someone said in Marathi - Sachin Ala Re, a group of audience laughed out loud
 shuruaati chah gendon par sachin ne ek ran banaaya
 After this, he hit two fours till the drinks
 unke har ran par darshakon kaa utsaah dekhne laayak tha
 As if the entire stadium was resurrected on squares
 sachin agar bhojankaal tak wicket par rahe hote to phir eden ke khachaakhach hone kii ummid thi
 Officials of the Bengal Cricket Association also said on Wednesday that they were expecting the biggest day for Eden on Thursday

 Sachin was also dismissed for seven runs in his last Ranji match, but then he won Mumbai by playing an unbeaten innings of 79 against Haryana in Rohtak, Haryana
