 Under RTI, Reserve Bank of India (P) Ltd was asked - "how much money does the government spend on printing different denomination notes?" The result of this whole exercise came with this answer

 Similarly, 3 of the government on printing the canceled 1000 rupee note

 varsh 2014 main jab police ne maamle kii closer report daakhil kii, to unhone ise khudakushi bataaya, jo postmortem report se bilkul ulat tha, kyonki postmortem report ke mutabik, namrata kii maut 'munh-naak daboche jane kii vajah se hinsak tareeke se dam ghutane' ke kaaran hui thi, or ye nishkarsh spasht sanket dete hai ki namrata kii hatya kii gai thi

 DDCA vice-president and former Test player Chetan Chauhan claimed that when the match 23
 3 over ke baad roak diya gaya to adhikari vichaar kar rahe the ki is mukaable ko jari rakhana thik hoga yaa nahin to hurst ne unhen adhikarik rup se bataaya ki srilankai team aage khilne main hichak rahi he, jisane us samay 83 ran par paanch wicket ganvaa diye the
 Chauhan said, "the match referee officially told me that a team is not ready to play further and it cannot force them to play
 yah bhartiya team nahin ho sakati kyonki mahendra singh dhoni khilne ke liye taiyaar the
 The Sri Lankan team had lost five wickets for 83 runs and hence decided to retreat
 srilankai team ne hi maidan chhodkar bhaagane kaa faisla kiya
 Chauhan blamed Hurst, saying that the match referee made a mistake by canceling the match
 unhone kaha, ‘‘is vivaad ke liye khel se jude prayek vyakti ko doshi tehraana chahie, isamen match referi bhi shaamil hai
 i do not think that if this match was between Australia and South Africa it would have been canceled
 agar pich khilne ke liye khatarnaak thi to match ko paanch over ke andar hi radd kar dena chahie tha, ise 24 over tak nahin chalane diya jaataa
 "he expressed surprise," i agree that it was not ideal for an international match, but it was not dangerous and it was not that it could not be played
 main bhi isi tarah kii pich or isse bhi kharaab pich par khel chukaa hum
 i never thought that the match could be canceled so easily

" ’’didisie adhikari ne pasa dalajit singh kii aguwai vaali bisisiai kii maidan evam pich samiti ke paale main phenk diya, jise ravivaar ko barkhaast kar diya gaya tha
 Chauhan said, "we take moral responsibility and do not want to deviate from our responsibility, but the pitch and grounds were built as per the directions of Daljit and his committee
 hamane vahi kiya jo hamen kaha gaya
 They are experts, not us
 ’’ didisie ke sachiv es pi basal ne bhi doshaaropan ke silsile ko barkaraar rakhte hue kaha ki dalajit singh par ‘andhaa vishwaas’ karnaa galati thi

 The comments Women pass around paper plates filled with food in the ladies compartment of the Mumbai local train
 If there is any birthday, like in this situation it was the birthday of one of the members' daughter, or any other festival, ladies in the compartment don't spare any effort to celebrate that particular occasion
 And they do it so lovingly and also invite the other women around them
 i have also been invited in celebrations so many times
 i am sure most of the other ladies also must have experienced the same
 And if you think it is one woman's responsibility to organize these then no
 Women take it upon themselves, they plan and decide the budget and share
 i have been welcomed so lovingly in some groups and sometimes i feel like i am a part of them
 While some women want to sleep and want silence in the train 
 They crib of such women in groups
 But there is something about these groups that i love 
 Sometimes it is this sense of belonging, companionship that draw these women together,
 Also the love , the care and the crazy fun that they have

 The policies of PM are central government, its poor friendly program
 unhone kaha ki jab se narendra bhai is desh ke piem bane hai, ye teen nasoor- jatvaad, vanshavaad or votbank ke liye tushtikaran ko upi ke baad gujarat kii janata bhi nakaar diya
 It is now clear that democracy is taking an entry in the era of Politics of Performance

 Shah said that the entire credit for the victory goes to the public and BJP workers

 bjp's vote percentage has increased compared to 2012, our vote percentage is 47 percent
 8 se badhkar 49
 10 has happened
 unhone kaha ki ghor jativaadee prachaar ke baad bhi jansamarthan main 1

 vipaksh par aarope lagaate hue shah ne kaha ki congress ne chunaav ko muddon ko bhatka kar jatvaad ke disha main le jane kaa prayaas kiya gia or jatvaad kii aag main jhonkne kii koshish kii
 Not only this, in its campaign, the Congress also tried to divert from issues by spreading confusion, but the people rejected it and all the prominent leaders of Congress have lost elections

 a thunderous contest with the Congress? The victory in Gujraj was termed as a one-sided victory by the BJP president
 unhone kaha ki chunaav main koi kaante kii takkar nahin thi, ham 8 pratishat vot se aage hai
 The reason for the decrease in seats is the low level of publicity, because of which casteism was instigated by the Congress
 iviem ke kaaran jite?iviem vivaad par jawaab dete hue shah ne kaha ki chunaav kaise hoga ye bijepi nahin chunaav ayog tay karata he
 If evms were tampered with, how would the Congress win the 2009 elections, the Punjab Assembly elections and the recently held Punjab bodies

 No injuries reported— ANI UP (@aninewsup)july 17, 2016 Before the next Lok Sabha elections, the Congress wants to pass the Food Security Bill
 in dinon party is bill ke liye loksabhaa kaa satr bulaane kii kavayad main he
 The stalwarts of the party and the government are engaged in talks with the opposition parties
 lekin upie main uski sahyogi party ensipi ne is bill kii safalataa par andeh jataa diya he
 NCP supremo and Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar said on Monday that there is a scam around the Food Security Bill, but the UPA government neither has the money to run the scheme nor the adequate government structure to implement it
 iske alaava pavaar ne yah daawa bhi kiya ki is bill ko lagu karne ke liye jitne anaaj bhandar kii jarurat he, desh main utani storage nahin he
 After putting the question mark of the country's agriculture minister, the political managers of the Congress are sure to raise a question mark
 haalanki khud pavaar kaa ravaiya bhi kai baar aalochanaon ke centre main rahaa he
 For example, in August 2010, the Supreme Court criticized him for negligence on the issue of distributing free grain to the poor
 court ne ek janhit yachika kii sunwaayee ke dauraan kaha tha ki godaamon main sad rahe anaaj ko jaruratmandon ke bich baant diya jaae
 The Agriculture Minister took it as a suggestion and said that the system does not have the means to do so
 agali sunwaayee main jab court ko sarkaar ke tark kaa pataa chalaa, to usne jhidakate hue kaha ki ye suzav nahin aadesh tha
 Pawar and the UPA government were also strongly drawn on this issue in the Lok Sabha
 jediu netaa sharad pavaar ne apane kaarykaal kaa hawala dete hue kaha tha ki endie sarkaar ne bhi anaaj baanta tha, to ab aisa kyon nahin ho saktaa
 On the other hand, the BJP has said on the issue of food security bill that the PDS scheme should not be abolished in the states where its party is running the government
 gauratlab he ki bijepi shasit rajyon, khaastaur par chhattisgarh auki madhya pradesh main ye skim safaltaapurvak chal rahi hai auki kendriya agenciyon ne bhi isaki tasdik kii he

 After the stone pelting incident, the road in Dudhli village of Saharanpur is now silent
 gaanv main piesi or police bal tainaat he
 In the name of Ambedkar Jayanti and Sant Ravidas Jayanti, there is an atmosphere of panic due to the stone pelting and violence that took place in the village
 sirf gaanv hi nahin jile ke SSP lav kumaar kaa parivaar bhi sadame main he
 Aaj Tak reached to get to the bottom of the matter, in the village road Dudhli in Saharanpur district, from where this whole uproar started
 20 april ko is gaanv main ambedkar road par sant ravidaas jayanti ke naam par shobhaayatra nikaali gai
 According to an FIR lodged at Janakpur police station in Saharanpur district, on April 20, a man named Ashok Bharti took out a procession in the road of Dudhkali village
 darj FIR ke mutabik ambedkar jayanti ke naam par nikali shobhaayatra ke liye prashasan se anumati nahin lee gai thi
 As soon as Sobhayatra village reached Dudhli, hundreds of supporters including BJP MP Raghav Lakhan Pal, his brother Rahul Lakhan Pal, BJP MLA from Deoband state tried to forcibly take the yatra
 FIR kahati he ki tamaam log police ke dwaara lakh manaa karne ke baavjood jabaran aage badhate hue uttejk naare lagaate rahe, jiske baad duusari taraf khadey muslim sampradaay dwaara patharav shuru hua
 The people who came in the procession threw stones! Road on the 20th date in Dudhli village, the head of the incident Khadim Hussain told a conversation with Aaj Tak that during this time he was standing on the occasion
 mohammad ke mutabik police ke lakh manaa karne ke baavjood yatra gaanv main daakhil hona chaahati thi or jab prashasan ne unhen aane se manaa kiya to juluus main shaamil logon ne patharav kiya, iske jawaab main muslim samaaj kii ore se bhi javaabi patharav kiya gaya
 Khadim Hussain also said that BJP MP Raghav Lakhan Pal was present with the procession
 18 saal ke mohammad caff kaa daawa he ki patharav pehle juluus main aae logon kii ore se shuru hua
 Electoral politics behind the dispute! We met Ajmal in the village
 ajmal ne bataaya, 'us din gaanv ke logon ko pataa chalaa tha ki baahar ke kuch log juluus laa rahe hai
 All the people were from outside MP Raghav Lakhan Pal and there were many people from BJP
 jab police ne unhen andar aane se roka to unhone patharav shuru kar diya
 After that there was stone pelting from this side too
 67 saal ho gaye iske pehle aisi koi yatra nahin nikali
 When no permission was sought for a new tradition, it was disputed
 kai saal pehle masjid main meet bhi phenkaa gaya tha
 Dr
 ambedkar ne to sabake liye samvidhan likhaa tha, sab kaa khyaal rakhaa tha
 Rioting and bringing stones and tools from outside people, this is all politics, because the election of the mayor is coming and Raghav Lakhan Pal wants his brother to be the mayor
 musalmaan alag ho jaaen or hindu dalit unki taraf ho jaaen
 If Ajmal is to be believed, this ruckus was done for the civic elections in Saharanpur to be held in July this year
 sadak doodhli gaanv ab saharanpur nigam ke antargat aata he or is saal july main pehali baar is nigam main chunaav bhi hone vaale hai
 While talking to the villagers, there was no objection in the procession and we went to the mosque built inside the village to investigate
 namaaj kaa vakt khatm hua tha, isliye gaanv ke kai saare log hamen vahaan mili
 Hafiz Mohammad Noman said that he was also present there during the stone pelting incident
 noman ne kaha ki juluus main aae logon ne pehle police par patharav kiya jiske baad muslim samaaj ne bhi jawaab main patharav kiya
 We asked Noman that what could be a problem for the Muslim society by taking out a procession in the name of Ambedkar or Sant Ravidas Jayanti? To this, Numan said that there is no such rule in this village, then why is it being forced? Hafiz Mohammad Noman said that if the procession was to be taken out then the villagers should have talked first, then the yatra should have been taken out
 noman ke saath khadey logon ne bataaya kii juluus main aae logon main se koi bhi gaanv ke dalit samaaj nahin tha, balki baahar ke log the
 All the people of Muslim society said that they have no objection to the name of the yatra provided that the journey of Jayanti is with the permission from the administration
 pehle nahin thi juluus kii paramparasaharanpur ke esaspi lav kumaar ne bhi yahi kaha
 According to Love Kumar, there was never a practice in the road Dudhli village to carry out processions in the name of Ambedkar or Sant Ravidas Jayanti and there were administrative orders not to allow non-traditional processions
 kanoon vyavastha kharaab hone se rokane ke liye 14 april ko prastaavit shobhaa yatra ke liye anumati nahin di gai
 SSP Luv Kumar said that on April 14, he had received an application for a procession, but the local police station report was not allowed to withdraw the yatra
 SSP ke mutabik yaa yatra gaiyr paramparaagat thi or niyamon ke mutabik isaki ijaajat nahin di ja sakati thi or shaayad yahi vajah thi jiske baad 20 taarikh kii ghatana hui
 If the SSP had agreed, the faction seeking permission was made known by the rules
 raily kii ijaajat prashasan ne nahin di thi,baavjood local intelligence ke report kahati he 19 april ko hi gaanv main kuch tatwon dwaara shobhaayatra nikaale jane kii baat saamne ai thi
 According to the Saharanpur police, Vikramanjit of the Bajrang Dal had filed an application for the April 14 visit, but the local intelligence and local police reports refused to allow the administration to visit the shobha
 itnaa hi nahin SSP lav kumaar ne ajtak ko bataaya kii 20 april kii shobhaa yatra ke thik 1 din pehle unhen local intelligence se is bare main jaankaree mil gai thi, jiske baad gaanv main prashasnic bandobast tainaat kar diya gaya tha
 Not only this, when BJP mps and their supporters reached the village in a procession, all efforts were made to stop them
 is puure maamle main kuch or tathy saamne aae hai
 Earlier, the road in Dudhli village was never taken out in the name of Ambedkar and Sant Ravidas Jayanti
 haalanki 14 april ko ambedkar jayanti ke avasar par gaanv main dalit samaaj dwaara bhandara jarur hota he, lekin is par kabhi gaanv main vivaad nahin hua
 The second thing that came to light in the investigation was that 7 years ago an attempt was made to remove the Sobha Yatra on the occasion of Sant Ravidas Jayanti, after the cancellation of permission, the administration refused to allow any such non-traditional Shobha Yatra in the village
 Orders were given
 bahari log the shobhaayatra main!mayawati ke shasankaal main hi gram doodhli gaanv saharanpur nigam ke adheen aa gaya or is baar pehali baar vah mauka hoga jab doodhli gaanv ke log sthaneey nigam chunaav ke liye vot daalenge
 Further in the village, we met many more people of Muslim society and most of them said that 1500 Muslim families and 600 Dalit families lived in this village in a relaxed manner and there was no dispute
 chhutput ghatnaayen jarur hui, lekin isse gaanv kii shanti bhang nahin hui
 Abdul Majid, the survey head of elders and surveyor of Muslim society in the village, also claims that the people who brought the procession were not outsiders but from this village
 yah sawaal uthta he ki kya jaanboojhkar is gaanv kii shanti ko bhang karne kii koshish kii ja rahi thi? yaa phir ambedkar or sant ravidaas jayanti kii shobhaa yatra ko lekar muslim samudaay ko aapatti thi?muslim samudaay ke tamaamlogon ne baatcheet main yah mana kii shobhaa yatra se unhen koi dikkat nahin he, basharte yah gaanv waalon kii manjuuri or prashasan kii anumati se ho
 After talking to the Muslim community, we went to the other end of the village where the Dalit community lives
 20 taarikh ko hue bavaal ke baad gaanv main sannata pasra he or logon main dehshat kaa maahaul he
 The people of Dalit society kept on speaking openly about this matter
 lekin baatcheet main jo sach saamne aayaa vah yahi tha kii yatra lekar ke gaanv main aae log is gaanv ke nahin balki bahari log the
 People of Dalit society also believe that there has never been any ruckus between the two communities in this village before
 lakhan paal SSP ke ghar main jabaran ghuse!20 taarikh ko juluus kaa virodh karne ke baad lakhan paal or unke samarthak saharanpur ke esaspi lav kumaar ke ghar pahunch gaye
 It can be clearly seen in the photos that Lakhan Pal with his supporters forcibly entered the SSP house
 jab yah vakya hua tab lav kumaar apane ghar main maujuud nahin the
 In this case too, Saharanpur police has registered a case under sections of IPC against many people
 FIR ke mutabik 20 april ko dopaher ke dhai baje esaspi lav kumaar ke ghar ke main get se sthaneey bijepi saansad lakhan paal apane samarthakon ke saath uttejk narebaaji or police prashasan murdaabaad ke naare lagaate hue aawaaj ke andar jabaran ghus aae
 After the noise and ruckus, SSP Luv Kumar's wife Shakti and their two children present in the house got very nervous
 khud esaspi lav kumaar ne ajtak se baatcheet main bataaya ki bheed ko ghar main aata dekh unka parivaar sadame main tha
 Even today SSP Luv Kumar is receiving calls from his friends and relatives who want to know his well being
 maamle main ab tak 6 FIR darj ho gai he par SSP lav kumaar kii maane to ab tak 10 se zyada logon kii giraftaar bhi ho gai he
 But many big names, including BJP MP Raghav Lakhan Pal, Deoband MLA Brijesh who are involved in the procession, are still out of the police's grip
 bada sawaal uth rahaa he ki jab uttar pradesh main sattarudh dalon ke saansad or vidhayak khuleam dabangai dikhaa rahe hai or khud prashasnic amala inase peedit he to uttar pradesh main aam aadmi kaa kya hoga

 pakistan se swadesh lautne vaale bhartiya naagarik hamid ansaari kii zindaadilii or ‘sens of humar’ pehle kii tarah hi kaayam he
 Hamid said in an exclusive interview to India Today, 'I am Hamid Ansari and i am not a detective
 ’ unhone ek azaad shaks kii tarah pakistan main hue apane anubhavon ko india today ke saath saajha kiya
 Rejecting Pakistan's claims of espionage, Hamid said that he entered Pakistan for his love and got caught in indo-pak diplomatic tug of war
 sawaal-aapako kab pataa chalaa ki aapako reeha kar bharat waapas bheja ja rahaa he?hamid-mujhe apni rihaai kaa mangalvaar subah 6
 Detected at 30 o'clock
 main apni rihaai kii ummid kar rahaa tha lekin is tarah achaanak nahin
 When i came to know this, i was not happy
 main ek bhi lamhaa barbaad karnaa nahin chahta tha
 And i started preparing myself mentally and emotionally
 sawaal-aapaki pehali pratikriya kya thi?hamid-sarhad paar karne se pehle maine apane mata-pita ko duusari taraf khadey dekha
 Because Pakistani agencies were taking time to complete the formalities
 main betaab tha
 i requested the Pakistani authorities to complete the formalities as quickly as possible as it is inhumane to keep a son away from his mother
 sawaal-pakistan main hue apane anubhav ke bare main bataaen?hamid-kisi bhi insaan main acchhee or buree, donon baaten hoti hai
 Our tribes, cities and countries are also made up of similar humans
 isiilie mere anubhav achche or bure donon tarah ke hai
 i met good people who respected me as foreigners and i also met bad people who discriminated against me just for being Indian
 sawaal-pakistan main pehle teen saal kaise rahe?hamid-jis vakt main pakadaa gaya us vakt mujhe zaraa bhi suraag nahin tha kya ho rahaa he
 At that time i felt that i had fallen into a deep abyss and now it would not be possible to return home
 main parivaar ko yaad karata tha, mata-pita kii sochataa tha, apane kiye par pachhataata tha
 Just praying to the above for help
 sawaal-aapane pakistan is tarah jane kaa kadam kyon uthaaya?hamid-main is ladki se internet par mila
 We had feelings for each other and it was from both sides
 uske ghar par koi durghatana hone ke baad use kisi or se shaadi karne ke liye majaboor kiya jane laga
 She asked me for help because she wanted to marry me
 maine uski madad karne kii thaanee or aage badhane kaa faisla kiya
 i applied for a visa in Pakistan High Commission
 saath hi rotary international kii taraf se nyote kaa hawala diya
 But the Pakistan High Commission received a reply that the invitation was not being approved by Pakistan's Ministry of Home Affairs
 main jab vija paane kii koshish main vakt kharaab kar rahaa tha, udhar ladki ke mata-pita uski shaadi kii taiyaari karne lage
 a friend of mine in Pakistan, whom i met online, promised to introduce the girl
 usne mujhe afghanistan ke raste pakistan main daakhil hone ke liye guide kiya
 i was passionate, so i decided to do so
 main afghanistan main turakham border ke raste peshawar pahunchaa
 Later that same friend cheated on me and handed me a fake icard
 usee ne pakistani adhikariyon ko mere bare main jaankaree di
 Then i realized that all these traps had been laid
 kyonki us paar pehle se hi log mujhe pakadaney ke liye taiyaar baithe the
 Question- From where did you take it again? Did you know that no one knew about your arrival in Pakistan? hamid-police ne mujhe giraftaar kiya or kohat police stesan le gaye
 From there, Pakistan's intelligence agencies took me into their custody
 mujhe kohat main agyaat jagah le jaaya gaya
 But when the girl later told the authorities about her relationship with me, she shifted me from Kohat to Peshawar and another agency started questioning me
 maine peshawar main underground cell main teen saal akele hiraasat main bitaye
 Question- How was your experience in jail? Hamid - i had no idea when it was day and when it was night
 mujhe 24 ghante main ek baar washroom le jaaya jaataa tha wo bhi ek minute ke liye
 Only live food was given
 mujhe 40 din nahin nahaane diya gaya
 Sometimes i stayed without food for several days
 garmiyon main mujhe nahaane nahin diya jaataa tha or mujhe khud hi sharir kii durgandh bardaasht nahin hoti thi kyonki usamen keedon kaa sankraman ho chukaa tha
 When i was questioned, i was tortured such that my retina of the left eye pierced
 kai baar main behosh ho jaataa tha
 Sometimes there was vomiting of blood
 sawaal-aapako pakistan kii ore se jasoos bulaayaa jaataa tha?hamid-main jasoos nahin hum
 My heart took me there
 mere dimaag ko behatar pataa hona chahie tha
 But the Pakistani authorities had nothing to prove about my being a spy
 12 may 2015 ko peshawar district magistrate kii court main pesh kiya gaya, jahaan mujhe dm ne khud jhuthe kaboolname par dastakhat ke liye majaboor kiya
 Even after protesting, my thumbprints were taken and told that this is part of the process
 lekin aakhir main mujhe kaazi anwar or rakshanda naaz ke taur par rakshak mili or meraa cese ladane ke liye saamne aae
 He proved in the same courts that it is not a case of espionage
 aakhirkaar mujhe farji ycard hone ke jurm main teen saal kii sajaa sunai gai
 i made a mistake but paid a huge price for it
 or ye nishchit taur par kisi desh ke virodh main uthaaya gaya kadam nahin tha
 i cannot think of being involved in any such activity
 mere vakil ne sahi kaha ki main kisi pakistan virdohi gatividhi main shaamil nahin tha isliye jo sajaa sunai gai wo bahut kathor hogi
 Question- What was your first reaction when i came to India? When i returned to India after spending 2,232 days in hamid-pakistan, i was on adrenalin hormone boom
 apane vatan kii mitti par pair rakhte hue gajab kii khushi thi
 My family and i bowed and kissed Mother India and thanked
 saath hi allaah kaa shukriya kaha ki is mushkil daur ko nikaalane main hamaari madad kii
 Question- Now what is your plan next? Hamid- i want to start from where i left off
 main pehle job dhundhuga or phir apane mata-pita kii meri shaadi karne kii jo khwaahish he wo puri karuunga
 Start my own family mere parivaar ne kaaphi qurbaani di he or ab vakt he ki wo shanti ke saath saamaanya zindagi jien
 i want to stand with them to make them happy again
 mere bhai ne tab tak shaadi karne se manaa kar diya tha jab tak ki main bharat laut naa aauun

 ’ Former Australia captain Ian Chappell feels that Virat Kohli should be replaced as India's Test captain in place of Mahendra Singh Dhoni as the current captain is highly defensive and his mind goes on as if 'a confused professor is walking in the garden' 
 ’chapel ne newjiland ke haalia daure par bharat ke lachar pradarshan ke baad kohli ko jald se jald captain banane kii baat kahi he kyonki is daure par team kisi bhi praaroop main ek bhi jeet darj nahin kar saki
 Chappell wrote, "dhoni is a great captain in the shorter format of the game and his performance as a middle-order batsman is excellent
 lekin bataur test captain vah bahut jaldi pratikriya detaa he or vah khel ko us disha main le jaataa he jahaan use khud pataa nahin chalata ki aage kya karnaa he
 His situation becomes like a confused professor walking in the garden
 ’ unhone newjiland ke khilaaf dra hue duusare match ke bare main kaha, ‘uski roodhiwaadita ne pratidwandvi team ke behtareen ballebaajon ko zyada hi swatantraaa de di or kai aasaan ran de diye

 ’chapel ne kaha, ‘dhoni ko sachmuch england or australia ke 2011-12 main bharat ke niraashajanak daure ke baad hataa dena chahie tha, jab uski team lagaataar aath match ganvaa baithi thi
 Chappell said that Dhoni fails to make a strategy when the team is in the middle
 unhone kaha, ‘jab captain apni team ko baadha pahunchaana shuru kar de, use badalane kii jarurat hoti he
 In this bad phase, Dhoni failed to inspire his team and it seemed as if the captain was going through emotions
 isamen koi shaq nahin ki ek captain ko zyada lambey samay tak rukna chahie, us samay tak jab tak uski team harati he
 'chappell said,' Dhoni made a comeback when he whitewashed against Australia at home ground
 isamen koi shaq nahin ki vah is tarah kii parichit paristhitiyon main behatar captain he
 He does his best to put spinners on a regular basis, but he struggles when the conditions are favorable to fast bowlers

 This news is sad for the devotees of Bhole
 omkareshwar ke hajaaron varsh puraane swayambhu jyotirling kaa teji se ksharan ho rahaa he
 The reason is being told that the use of Jalabhishek and chemical puja material
 sant, pujari or shraddhalu sab dukhi hai
 Read this story about faith lying in difficulty 
 
 madhya pradesh ke khandwa jile main sthit baarah jyotirlingon main se ek omkareshwar ke hajaaron varsh puraane swayambhu jyotirling main itani teji se ksharan ho rahaa he ki ab iske astitv par hi khatra mandaraane laga he
 Parts of the formless Swayambhu Jyotirlinga are falling apart, but no serious efforts have been made to stop it so far
 sant-mahatmaon, pandit-pujaariyon or bhakton ko isaki chintaa sata rahi he, lekin sarkaar ko isaki koi chintaa nahin he
 For the first time in the Omkareshwar Jyotirlinga, when a piece of Shivalinga came out in 1996, the attention of the temple administration went to it
 mandir ke mukhya karypalan adhikari harisingh choudhary kehete hai, ''iske baad se lagaataar pujan-abhishek ke dauraan jyotirling ke chote-chote anshon ke ksharit hone kii shikaayatein aati raheen
 It was preserved on May 5, 2004 with the help of Engineers, Archaeologists and Experts of the Archaeological Survey of India
 is taakid ke saath ki ise kam-se-kam ek maah pani se bachaaya jaae
 When the devotees were stopped from the Jalabhishek at Jyotirlinga, there was a lot of protest and the administration lifted the ban within a week
 uske baad se ksharan or tej ho gaya
 Says Pankaj Sharan, Assistant Superintendent Engineer, Archaeological Survey of India, "the treatment itself was neutralized by premature watering
 '' sharan kaa kahana he ki yah jyotirling sand stone kaa he, jis par doodh, panchamrita, phool, belptr ke chadhaave se yah jaladhari main riskar ikattha hota he
 Rotten then forms lactic acid, which causes it great harm
 ise or ksharan se bachaana he to jyotirling kaa jalabhishek puri tarah rokna hoga
 Mahamandaleshwar Swami Vivekananda Puri, president of Omkareshwar Conspiracy Sant Samaj, does not agree with this
 ve kehete hai, ''jyotirling ko sarvaadhik nuksaan chemical lep se hua
 Otherwise, Jalabhishek is happening here since time immemorial
 ''darasal is maamle main khaasaa bavaal tab machaa, jab trust ke tatkaaleen mukhya karypalan adhikari swami tejanand ne 29 june, 2006 ko media main yah bayaan dekar khalabali machaa di ki yah jyotirling khandit ho chukaa he
 Therefore, it should be installed in Narmada and a new Shivling should be established
 is baat ko lekar saare sant-pujari or shraddhalu acroshit ho gaye or trust kii yah ghoshnaa kerani padi ki isi jyotirling ko sangrakshit kiya jayega
 "jyotirlinga is never fragmented," says managing trustee Rao Devendra Singh
 yah koi murti nahin he
 This is Sakshat Bholenath manifested in formless form
 ''khandwa ke colector niraj dube kehete hai, ''ksharan ko lekar sabhi chintit hai
 Now measures are necessary to stop it in a scriptural manner
 '' darasal abhi tak trust ne satahi upaay kiye, jisamen jyortiling par pehle doodh-panchamrita, pushp ko pratibandhit kiya gaya
 Then also directly Jalabhishek
 ab shraddhalu kalash main jal bharkar ek fibre ke tub main udel dete hai or phir tambe ke pipe se bholenath ko jaldhara chadhati he
 Ramaswamy, who came here from Kerala to visit, says with a sad heart, "neither God is able to see properly nor Abhishek
