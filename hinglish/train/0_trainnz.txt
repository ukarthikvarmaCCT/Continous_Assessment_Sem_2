 Even though Mahendra Singh Dhoni's team left the captaincy of India's short format, the discussion of Yuvraj and 'mahi' in the video chat has been friendly and full of excitement
 lekin yuvaraj ke pita yograj singh abhi bhi dhoni par nishaanaa saadhane kaa koi mauka nahin chhod rahe hai
 Yograj, who has played cricket on behalf of the Indian team, while talking to the website Sportskeeda, Yograj fiercely targeted Dhoni
 tippaniyan According to the website, Yograj said, 'let's talk honestly, did i predict this two years ago or not? If you look at my old interviews, i had clearly said that he does not like Yuvraj and there is politics within the team
 maine khud bharat ke liye khelaa he or jaanata hum ki ye sab kaise hota he
 Dhoni was running his show with the team and now that Virat Kohli has taken over, things have changed a lot
 vah gharelu cricket main yuvaraj kii parformances ko nazarandaaj nahin kar sakate phir chaahe vah vanade ho yaa tii-20, vah parfect feet he, yah baat dhoni ne kabhi samajhane kii koshish tak nahin kii
 Yograj did not stop here, he said, 'in May i told him (to Yuvraj) that you will not support you in the Indian team, just concentrate on your performance and everything will be correct
 usne focus diya or parinaam aap khud dekh sakate hai 
 i told him it's fine without marriage, but pay attention to the game because Dhoni will retire one day and that's what happened
 vah (yuvaraj) zyada meri baat sunata nahin lekin ab vah bhi jaanata hai ki uskaa pita sahi tha
 Significantly, Yuvraj played his last ODI in the year 2013 and has been successful in making a comeback in the ODI team after three years, Yograj has been attacking Mahendra Singh Dhoni for his son Yuvi's selection in the team even before that
 Huh
 yograj ne kaha, meri raay main balle ke saath dhoni ab kamjor padate ja rahe hai or vah pehle jaisaa pradarshan nahin kar paaenge
 Now their gurus will break
 website ke anusaar, yograj ne kaha, 'eemaandaaree se baat karte hai, maine do saal pehle is bare main bhavishyavaanee kii thi yaa nahin? aap mere puraane intervyuu dekhen to maine saaf kaha tha ki vah yuvaraj ko pasand nahin karata or team ke bheetar raajnneeti hoti he
 i have played for India myself and know how it all happens
 dhoni team ke saath apana sho chalaa rahe the or ab jab viraat kohli ne techover kar liya he to chijen kaaphi badal gai hai
 He cannot ignore Yuvraj's performance in domestic cricket, whether it is ODI or T20, he is perfect fit, Dhoni never tried to understand this
 yograj yaheen nahin ruke, unhone kaha, ' may main maine usase (yuvaraj se) kaha tha ki bhartiya team main tumhen koi saport nahin karegasirf apni parformens par dhyaan do or sab sahi ho jayega
 He gave focus and you can see the result yourself
 maine usase kaha shaadi bagaiyrah to thik he, magar game par dhyaan do kyonki dhoni ek din ritair hoga or vahi hua
 He (yuvraj) does not listen to me much but now he also knows that his father was right
 gauratlab he ki yuvaraj ne apana aakhri vanade varsh 2013 main khelaa tha or teen varsh baad main vanade team main vaapasi karne main safal rahe hai yograj isse pehle bhi apane bete yuvi ke team main chayan nahin hone ke liye mahendra singh dhoni ko aade haath lete rahe hai
 Yograj said, in my opinion, Dhoni is getting weaker now with the bat and he will not be able to perform as before
 ab unka gurur tut jayega
 Yograj did not stop here, he said, 'in May i told him (to Yuvraj) that you will not support you in the Indian team, just concentrate on your performance and everything will be correct
 usne focus diya or parinaam aap khud dekh sakate hai 
 i told him it's fine without marriage, but pay attention to the game because Dhoni will retire one day and that's what happened

 Former Reserve Bank Governor Raghuram Rajan has said that the Goods and Services Tax (GST) applicable in India is a big step in the right direction but it is clear from the difficulties in its implementation that jugaad is made in India
 jiesti kii tarif karte hue rajan ne tanj kiya ki bharat main koi bhi kaam bina jugad ke puraa nahin hota
 During an interview to India Today in Davos, Rajan said that the country has achieved rapid growth during the last five years and this pace is the result of the economic direction of the last 20 years

 Only two international matches have been played at Perth's new stadium and this is the first Test match at this ground
 is baat kii charchaa he ki is pich se tej gendbaajon ko madad milegi
 Langer said on Tuesday before leaving for Perth, "hopefully it will be like the traditional pitch at the Waka ground
" ham lambey samay se gati or oochaal kii baat kar rahe hai
 It would be a great thing if we got such help from the pitch
 ’langer kaa maananaa he ki bharat ke saath hone vaale duusare test match main vaapasi karne ke liye unki team maansik or shaareerik rup se apana sabakuch jhonk degi
 ICC Rankings: Kohli's reign continues, but according to the weak cricinfo report, the temperature is likely to be 36 degrees on the first day of the second Test starting on Friday

 The hosts are hopeful that Perth's wicket will be favorable to the fast bowlers and that the result of the match can come here before five days
 langer ne kaha, 'perth main pehle bhi gati or oochaal dekhne ko mila tha
 We have also seen in the odis and T20s how much help was given to the fast bowlers here

 In Adelaide, the team will be led by Virender Sehwag in place of Dhoni, who will take the field in the hope that India has won one win and one draw on this ground in the last two matches

 madhyakram main rahul dravid, sachin tendulkar or khaastaur par vivies lakshmana ko apane balle kaa munh kholana hoga kyonki is diggaj tikdi ko lekar sanyas tak kii baaten uthne lagi hai
 In the absence of Dhoni, wicketkeeper batsman Wriddhiman Saha will play the role behind the wicket
 dhoni kii chaaya ke kaaran gardish main pade saaha ko bharat main sabase acha wicketiper kaha jaataa he or is lihaaj se saaha ko yah baat sabit bhi kerani hogi
 The reason for this is that after Dhoni, who had announced his retirement from Test matches in 2013, he would be the first choice of the selectors for the responsibility behind the wicket
 gendbaaji main bhartiya team ravichandran aswin kii vaapasi chaahegi kyonki perth main vinay kumaar ko khilaane kaa prayog buree tarah naakaam rahaa tha

 com / m2w7hxl1i1— ANI (@ani_news)9 may 2017 Prime Minister Narendra Modi's speech from the ramparts of the Red Fort is indicating how the coming five years will be for the country
 janata se sidhaa samvaad bina laag−lapet ke apni baat or parivaar ke mukhiya jaise andaaz main ghar ke sadasyon kya karen− kya na karen jaisi hidaayaten
 Accusations - The countenance of pulling legs and ridiculing things has become air as soon as the elections are over
 ab bahumat nahin sahmati se aage badhane kii baat he
 The Prime Minister's address may have heard the praise of all the former Prime Ministers and Governments, shock those who have been saying that Modi believes only in beating his drums
 gaanv−garib−majdoor−kisaan sabake liye kuch na kuch karne kii baat chaahe samaajwaad ke kisi naare kii tarah sunai de, magar sandesh saaf he samaajawaadee nitiyon or unke tahat bane sarkari dhaanchon se upar uthne kaa vakt aa gaya he
 Not Jawaharlal Nehru, it is a sign of taking the country on the path described by Sardar Patel
 jarjar or puraane ho chuke yojana ayog ko khatm kar nai vyavastha banane kaa elaan
 Modi's speech is not an attempt to make his streak bigger by erasing old lines, but laying the foundation of his new line
 gram swaraj or panchayat raaj jaise vichaaron kii upyogita or unke amal par puraani bahes ke bich saansadon ko sidhe gaanv se jodna ek nae vichaar kii shuruyaat he
 The criterion of leadership is not to count problems but to suggest solutions
 isamen modi apane pehle bhaashan kaamyaab hote dikh rahe hai
 For the creation of national character, the head of the country has to give advice to the people, why did this happen, it is a separate debate
 magar nai kaary samskruti dallalon−bichauliyon par lagaam kasne or mantriyon ko agenda ke mutabik kaam karne ke liye kade nirdesh is disha main mahatvapurn pahal maane ja sakate hai
 It is obvious that the manner and speed of implementation of the decisions will determine the authenticity of the government itself and above all, Prime Minister Modi, but his rule of twelve years in Gujarat definitely tells that he is not left behind in this
 badali sarkaar shashan tantra or kamarchaariyon main vishwaas jagaa paati he yaa nahin ye bhi pradhanmantri modi kii ek badi chunauti he
 It is certainly that today's speech of Prime Minister Modi is the first but concrete step towards bringing back this trust
 police ko is baat kaa tab pataa chalaa jab wo jail se dur ja chukaa tha
 According to Dallas News news, Joshua Hanson has been sentenced to 27 months
 kyonki us par drugs bechney kaa aarope he
 The accused stayed outside for 1 day and returned to the jail with his luggage
 police ne bataaya ki is par philhal karrwai chal rahi he
 The moon is the master of the mind and affects the mind
 jab bhi chandramaa dooshit hota he, man or man kii samasyaayein vyakti ko khub pareshaan karti hai
 Rahu is the most polluted moon
 agar rahu or chandramaa kaa yoga ho to ise shuddh rup se grahan yoga kahana chahie
 But the sum of Moon Saturn or Moon Ketu cannot be called Eclipse Yoga
 grahan yoga jab bhi kundali main ho yah sirf samasyaayein hi paidaa karata he 
 What are the common problems caused by eclipse yoga? - The person has the most problems of mind
 - use man or kalpana kii samasyaayein pareshaan karti hai 
 - The person usually keeps complaining of ghosts hindrance

 a verbal war between Mamata banerjee-asaduddin Owaisi, AIMIM of Tejowasi will contest the 2021 elections in West Bengal
 Mamata Banerjee, who is fighting the Muslim vote, is going to knock Asaduddin Owaisi's party AIMIM in the politics of West Bengal
 bengal main bijepi ke badhate graph or ovaisi ke bengal main 2021 vidhansabha chunaav ladane ke elaan ne tiemasi pramukh or siem mamata banerjee kii chintaa ko badha diya he
 In view of this, Mamta Banerjee has hardened her attitude regarding Owaisi and has started to attack fiercely, so Owaisi said that this is an insult to Muslims
 is tarah se mamata banerjee dotarafa chunautiyon se ghiri hui najar aa rahi hai
 Let me tell you that AIMIM candidate Kamarul Hoda won the assembly by-election in Kishanganj seat in the Muslim dominated area of bihar
 bihar kaa yah ilaaka pashchim bengal se sata hua he
 Now Asaduddin Owaisi has announced to contest the 2021 assembly elections in Bengal
 iske chalate mamata banerjee apane votbank ko lekar sashankit najar aa rahi hai
 Mamta attacked Owaisi, Mamata Banerjee on Monday attacked him in a public meeting in Cooch Behar without naming Owaisi and alleged in his speech that his party is working with money from BJP
 jaise hinduon main charampanthi hai, usee tarah alpsankhyakon main bhi charampanthi saamne aa rahe hai
 There is a political party, taking money from BJP
 vah party hyderabad se he, pashchim bengal se nahin he
 People should avoid listening to Hyderabad-based extremists and do not believe in such forces
 ovaisi ne khelaa muslim carbosaduddin ovaisi ne mamata banerjee par palatwaar karte hue mangalvaar kaha ki mamata kaa bayaan unki niraashaa or hataasha dikhaata he
 This shows that AIMIM is emerging as a major force in West Bengal
 ovaisi ne kaha ki ham nyaay or adhikaar ke liye lard rahe hai
 If the Chief Minister of West Bengal sees this as extremism, then i cannot do anything
 charampanth tab he jab aap (mamata) bijepi ko 18 siten jeetne detii hai
 Extremism is when, even after 100% Muslims vote, you are not able to stop the BJP and insult the Muslims of the state by abusing me
 ovaisi ne kaha kipaschim bengal main musalamaanon kii kharaab saamaajikhalaat ko lekar mamata banerjee ko chintit hona chahie
 He said that the disappointment of the Muslims has come due to Mamata Banerjee's talk
 musalamaanon ne puure dil se unhen vot diya tha or is baat ko ujagar kiya tha ki unki party bengal main haar rahi he
 Mamatamata Banerjee, surrounded by two-way challenges, is already surrounded by BJP
 bijepi mamata banerjee par muslim tushtikaran kaa aarope lagaatar hinduon maton ko saadhane main juty he
 As a result, the bjp's graph has steadily increased in Bengal
 isi saal loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi 18 siten jeetne main kaamyaab rahi he
 After the BJP, now Asaduddin Owaisi's AIMIM has started to increase its graph in Bengal
 aise main ovaisi ne bengal main hone vaale vidhansabha chunaav ladane kaa elaan kar diya he
 Fear of slipping Muslim votes, about 30 percent of the total voters of West Bengal are Muslims
 aise main bengal kii siyasat main ye matadaata kingmekar kii bhoomika main hai
 Currently, Muslim voters are considered the core vote bank of TMC
 aise main ovaisi kii najar inhen muslim maton par he, jisane mamata banerjee ko chintaa main daal diya he
 This is the reason why Mamta Banerjee has started taking Auwaisi on her target along with targeting BJP
 aise main dekhnaa hoga ki aage kya in donon dalon ke netaaon ke bich isi tarah se jubaani jang jari rahati he yaa inaki ladaai kaa phayda koi or uthaa le jayega?

 She studied in her maiden school till the 10th grade and later went to her in-laws

 ' shekhar ek jeevani kii bhoomika ke aakhir main agyeya ne yah likhaa tha
 Today is his birthday and this book is considered a biographical novel of the agnostic
 unka puraa naam sachchidanand hiranand vatsyayan tha
 He added the agnostic
 agyeya yani jo gyey na ho yaa samaj se pare ho yaa jise janaa na ja sake; jise athwa jiske sambandh kii baaten kisi prakaar jaani hi na ja sakati hon; jo gyanathit ho
 Amazing proclamation, isn't it? Agnay was a rational scientist, philosopher, elite poet, storyteller, writer
 shabd or gyaan main bhi, abhivyakti or style main bhi
 Agyeya was not like the other Hindi writers of his era, dejected, unhappy, mangatha, sad, bejar, charan or flag bearer
 unka cheharaa, rangath, haavbhaav, lekhan deept or ek tarah kii kuleenata liye hue tha
 Despite that there was no lack of sorrow in his life as well
 shaayad isiilie kavita 'asaadhya veena' main unhone likhaa- 'dukh sabko maanjata he
 
 
 'shekhar is the first line of a biography,' there is a power in pain, which gives vision
 jo yatnaa main he vah drashtaa ho saktaa he'
 Agnoy was a free man despite his innocence, intellectual, saint, nobility and naivete
 bandhan unhen sweekaar nahin tha
 Love was his basic element
 chaahe vah vichaardhaara se ho, sahitya se ho, yaa vyakti se
 This is the reason why the philosopher of 'asadhya Veena', till his first autobiographical novel of 'shekhar Ek Biography', remains a person full of emotion
 shekhar, jise agyeya kaa hi prativimb mana jaataa he, behad svachhand he, par sharmila bhi
 Person's privacy is at the top here
 vah janmajaat vidrohi he
 The family, society and dignities have both questions and rebellion towards all
 vah swatantraaa kaa pakshdhar he
 Person-independence has a very deep meaning in his personal life
 naitik-aniatik kii parvaah use bilkul nahin he
 Perhaps this is why Shekhar even tells the relationship sister Shashi in his novel, 'since when have i called you sister, but sisters are not as close as you are and not as far as you are
 'agyeya kaa doosraa upanyaas 'nadi ke dweep' bhi pichley upanyaas kii niztaa, ekantata or svachhand soch kaa vistaar hi he
 By coming to his third novel 'apne Apne Stranger', it is solitary and deep
 yahaan naitik-aniatik kaa sawaal tham jaataa he
 Philosophy deepens
 yahaan vah kehete hai ki 'na to manushya apane hisaab se jivan chun saktaa he, na hi mrityu
 He can just chew his way
 'vah gulam bharat main paisa hue
 Wandered here till he grew up from childhood, stood on his own feet
 lekhan bhi unhone yah darshanik ghumkkadi barkaraar rakhi
 Agnayya tried all forms of prose in criticism, story, novel and also went to Sarah
 jo bhi likhaa, kya khub likhaa
 But his travelogue and poet form is more simple and simple than the prose writer
 ham nadi ke dweep hai,ham nahin kehete kihamako chhodkarsrotasvini bah jaye
 
 se lekar-'kohre main namaghna ek tarabhuj sa,bahut sataati hayakshini kii yadvirahinee!'agyeya kaa aupchaarik parichay likhen, to vah kuch yon hoga
 Born on 7 March 1911 in Kushinagar
 puraa naam yon tha sachchidanand hiranand vatsyayan 'agyeya'
 Was a famous Hindi writer
 kavi, shailikar, kathakaar, lalit-nibandhkaar, sampadak or adhyaaapak
 Father Pandit Hiranand Shastri was an expert on ancient scripts
 inkaa bachapan inke pita kii naukari ke saath kai sthanon kii parikrama karte hue beetaa
 His family reached Nalanda in 1919, roaming Lucknow, Srinagar, Jammu
 nalanda main agyeya ke pita ne unhen hindi padhwaana, likhavana shuru kiya
 In the year 1921, the family of Agyeya reached Ooty
 yaheen agyeya ke pita ne unka yagyopavit karaayaa or 'vatsyayan; kulanaam diya
 Agnayya started early education in language, literature, history and science at home
 1925 main agyeya ne metric kii privet pariksha punjab se uteern kii iske baad do varsh madras chrishchiyan college main evam teen varsh forman college, lahore main sansthagat shiksha pai
 Agnayya completed her b
sc
 and MA in English in Lahore
 isi bich bhagat singh ke saathi bane or 1930 main giraftaar ho gaye
 When liberated after serving six years in jail and detention, he remained in the editing board of Agra newspaper 'sainik' for a few days in 1936
 saal 1937-39 main 'vishaal bharat' ke sampadakeey vibhaag main rahe
 Agnayya entered military service in 1943 after being in All India Radio for a few days
 1946 main sainya seva se mukt hokar vah shuddh rup se sahitya main lage
 He made Meerut and then Allahabad and finally Delhi his center
 agyeya ne 'pratik' kaa sampadan kiya
 Prateek gave a new strong platform to the writers, poets of the new concept of modern literature of Hindi and created a new history of literary journalism
 1965 se 1968 tak agyeya saptahik 'dinmaan' ke sampadak rahe
 From 1973 onwards, we renamed 'prateik' and started to say 'new Prateik'
 saal 1977 main unhone dainik patr navabharat times ke sampadan kaa bhaar sambhala or agast 1979 main unhone navabharat times se avkaash grahan kiya
 Agnayya edited 'tar Saptak' in 1943 with a lengthy role on the statements and poems of seven poets
 jo hindi kavy sahitya main vishisht sthaan rakhata he
 Agnay gave a new twist to modern Hindi poetry, which is known as experimental poetry
 unhone doosraa saptak, teesraa saptak or chauthaa saptak kaa sampadan bhi kiya
 The famous compositions of Agnayya include 'bhagnadoot', 'anxiety', 'italam', 'momentarily on green grass',' bawra aheri ',' gate across the courtyard ',' purva ',' how many boats in how many times', ' Because i know him ',' Sagar Mudra ',' First i weave silence ',' Shekhar, a biography ',' Island of the river ', and' Apne Apne Stranger '
 vah bhartiya puraskaar, antarrashtriya 'golden rith' puraskaar, sahitya academy puraskaar or gyanpith puraskaar se sammanit hue the
 The unknowable had ever said, finger cannot be raised on his writing
 isi tarah unpar likhnaa bhi ek duruh kaam he
 Kane Upanishad says' He who knows him is unknown to him
 jo usko nahin jaanata uske liye wo gyaat he
 'the unknowable was also like this
 unpar likhane ke liye kitaaben, stambh, shodh sab kam hai
 So many different forms of life and so varied, abundant writing
 
 
 kabhi 'smriti ke galiyaaron se' main 'puchchal taare ke saath-saath' sheershak ke bich unhone likhaa tha- bachapan kitni tarah kii kaal-gananaa main bitta he, meraa bhi beetaa, yah aaj kisi ko samajhnaa to kathin ho hi gaya he, kabhi-kabhi lagata he ki swayan apane ko samajhnaa bhi din-ba-din kathintar ho jaayegaa
 Today, the same news period is so dominant that gradually the practice of seeing a letter or calendar is also disappearing
 jinhen akhbaar kaa vyasan he ve akhbaar kii taarikh dekh lete hai or iske alaava kaal kii koi gananaa unke liye koi arth nahin rakhti
 And those who are addicted to radio have the same condition: radio tells us what day it is, what date it is
 in donon se kaal kaa mahanad suukhta-sikudta kitni palati dhar ban gaya he, is kii ore shaayad hi kabhi kisi kaa dhyaan jaataa ho
 
 
 Then this is the era of television
 kshanik chitron or chillaahaton kaa yug
 Nevertheless, you will still remember in the year 2019, and as long as the words of Hindi remain, you will be remembered and will be remembered

 jab mujhe wo aakhri blo dry mil rahaa tha, to main intjaar kar rahi thi or mere baalo ko dhoyaa ja rahaa tha
 The stylist who gave me my blow dry understood that this was my last blow dry because my friend was shooting the whole process and my sister was with me and we were talking about it
 ""isse stylist ne is bare main mahasoos kiya hoga
 i said that you know that maybe i can come and shave it

 Because i didn't want him to feel shocked
 jab ham bal katwane ke liye gaye, to maine kaha ki ise shev kar do
 But my hair stylist said no, now is the time, you can get a nice hair cut
 isliye bald hone se pehle maine do baar hair cat liya
 "sonali told-" The first time i took a haircut, my heart did not break
 balki mujhe ehsaas hua ki baalo se zyada ahm he jinda rahanaa
 In this way there was a big change in my thinking
 aap jaanate hai ki main apni life or apane baalo ke saath kaaphi boring rahi hum
 Because my hair was straight and long
 jab aapke itane lambey bal hote hai, to aap hameshaa ise kaatane se darate hai

 It is being discussed all over the country

 According to social psychologist Sudhir Kakkar, there are two contradictory points at the center of this debate
 pehali yah ki ladakiyon or auraton ko sadak par kii jane vaali chhedchhad se suraksha milani chahie
 The second thing is to like and dislike that young boys and girls should be allowed to decide where, how and with whom

 Lok Sabha MP Kalvakuntala Kavita says, "UP should take a lesson from the experience of Telangana", where policemen walking in plain clothes use spy cameras to identify the miscreants

 For example, does a third person have the right to interfere in love affairs or intimate relationships in the name of curbing molestation? Does the police have the right to arbitrarily suspect every man, interfere in his privacy, harass him under any circumstances anywhere, make inquiries? Before taking steps to secure roads in Uttar Pradesh or any state, it would be necessary to consider these questions and other similar questions

 Some time ago a soldier killed a SIMI terrorist

 After this, SIMI terrorists used to live in the way they wanted and used to attack others
 kuch to aarope lagaate hai ki laachaar prahari tiwari kii duty bhi thakur ne hi aatankiyon ke ishaare par lagaai thi
 However, the then Jail Superintendent Thakur dismisses it, saying, "I myself had written several letters to the government several times asking these terrorists to be removed and kept in the Central Jail, but the government did not take any decision
" '' ghatana ke chah din pehle ve badwani jail adheekshak kaa pad grahan karne ke liye relive ho gaye the

 Lucknow pakistan ke abtabad shahar main osama bin laden ko uske ghar main ghus kar jin logon ne maaraa tha us navy sil commandos kii ginati america ke sabase jambaj force main hoti he
 So is Kim Jong Un the next target of America's SEAL commandos? Is Seal Commando entering Osama like Kim Jong preparing to kill them, just like Osama? In fact, it has been reported from a South Korean newspaper that special commandos of the US Navy SEAL Six have been given the contract to kill Marshal Kim Jong Un
 jaise ossam ko maaraa gaya
 The way Saddam was gunned
 jaise gaddaphi ko ghutanon par laayaa gaya
 The way hostages were rescued from the pirates of Somalia
 ab vaise hi kim par nakel kasenge US ke navy sil commandon
 Both the US Intelligence Agency and South Korean Agency Nekim Jong have given tokens to kill them
 kab kahaan or kaise diya jayega oparation ko anjaam ye koi nahin jaanata sivaae inke
 And they never come by telling
 magar jab aate hai to kaam tamaam kar ke hi jate hai
 In May 2011, these Navy SEAL commandos secretly came to Pakistan
 or jab gaye to osama kii laash ko saath lekar gaye
 How to kill kahaan dafnaaya aaj tak ye rahasy he
 But what is true is that these commandos have made Osama their victim
 oparation khufia he isliye koi bhi isaki jaankaree dene ko taiyaar nahin
 But this news was sparked when Jungang Daly, a South Korean newspaper, guessed that the Navy SEAL commandos detachment team Six
 jo ek khaas mishan ko anjaam dene ke liye uttar korea kii sarhad ke nazadik drill oparation ko anjaam de rahi he
 North Korean agencies themselves have accepted the news of the newspaper Jungang Daily as true
 saath hi is bare main kim jong un ko aagaah karte hue unki suraksha kadi kar di gai he
 North Korean agency Marshal Kim Jong has ordered his spies not only to gather as much information as possible about the Navy seal's operation, but also how to avoid it
 Has started to know
 maujuuda khatre ko dekhte hue kim ke suraksha salaahkaar ne use khuli or bheed-bhaad vaali jagahon se dur rahane ko kaha he
 After which, not only has Kim's activities in open spaces decreased significantly than before, but since 2013 his exit has been reduced from 51% to 32%
 itnaa hi nahin car bam dhamaake ke dar se wo wo apni alashin marcedes se bhi kam hi chalata he
 Moreover, it has increased its security considerably
 navy sil sicks ke bare main haalanki ye khabar pakki he kisouth koriake salanaa military eksrasise main uske commandonz ne bhaag liya he
 This news has raised the senses of Kim and North Korea's security agencies
 uttar korea ko lag rahaa he ki south korea ke raste navy sil commando unke desh kii rajdhani pyonggyang or yahaan tak ki kim jong un ke mahal main daakhil ho sakati he
 Not only this, a number of US Special Forces commandos participated in the military exercise in South Korea in the name of Fole Eagle and key-resolve
 yahaan tak ki ek bade america akhbaar ne bhi ye kaha he ki america president donald trump pyonggyang ke khilaaf military ection kii sambhaavnaaon par bhi vichaar kar rahe hai

 Men also have increased awareness about anti-tanning, anti-pollution treatment and now they are also turning to parlor in short intervals
 prashanth bhushan aam aadmi party ke netaa to hai hi, jane-maane vakil bhi hai
 But when he spoke of a referendum on whether or not the army is in Kashmir, everyone was shocked
 ve desh kii raajnneeti se hatakar aisa mudda uthaa rahe hai, jiske bare main amuman kuch bhi nahin sochaa jaataa he
 The army in Kashmir is not there for ten or twenty years, but immediately after independence, when Pakistan, along with armed tribesmen, attacked there
 uske baad 1965 main bhi pakistan ne kashmir par kabja karne ke iraade se vahaan hamalaa kiya or bharat ko bade paimaane par sena bhejni padi
 At that time, Pakistan's troops had entered three important areas of Kashmir, Tithwal, Uri and Poonch
 kargil kaa prakaran kise yaad nahin he, jab chupchaap pakistani phogiyon ne vahaan banksron par kabja kar liya tha or saikadon bhartiya sainikon ko jaan se haath dho baithna padaa tha
 Even today Pakistan continues to infiltrate Kashmir through its puppets
 itihaas gavaah he ki pakistan banane ke samay se hi uske hukmaranon kii manshaa kashmir ko hadapney kii rahi he or is disha main vah hameshaa praytn karata rahata he
 After knowing so much, how did Prashant Bhushan say such a big thing and if he thinks wholeheartedly about the use and misuse of the army, why did he not ask for a referendum on the removal of Army Law (AFSPA) from Manipur? Social worker Sharmila Chanu has been on hunger strike for 13 years to get this law removed from Manipur
 to phir prashanth bhushan kyon nahin bole
 If the Indian Army did not have a presence in Kashmir, then when would Pakistan have entered and sat there
 prashanth bhushan ne paak adhikrut kashmir ke bare main yahi baat kahi hoti to acha lagata
 How cleverly Pakistan has captured it by naming Azad Kashmir
 vahaan ke bare main ve bol sakate the
 It is true that where the army resides, the general laws cannot be fully implemented, but the record of the Indian Army is not so bad that a referendum should be taken to remove it
 galat kaam karne vaale kai sainikon or afasaron ke khilaaf vahaan karrwai bhi hui he
 It is not that there is darkness
 ab yahi kaha ja saktaa he ki aam aadmi party kii safalataa se prashanth bhushan itane utsahit ho gaye hai ki ve samvedansheel muddon par bhi apni raay dene lage hai or vah bhi raksha sambandhi maamalon main
 They have to declare this greed
 unhen nahin bhoolanaa chahie ki is kashmir ke liye hamaare hajaaron jabanj sainikon ne apni jaan ganvaai he

 However, there is no news of loss of life or property

 to bhaajapa kaa maananaa he ki chaahe diaiji di ji vanzaara hon 
 
 
 
 yaa phir dipti police kamishnar abhaya chudasama yaa phir amit shah khud 
 
 
 All these countries are devotees whom the Congress is punishing to kill the terrorist named Sohrabuddin
 jaahir he, ki ek shaks jiske paas itani taadaad main aslaa ore goliyaan milen wo antkavaadi hi to hoga 
 
 
 Although this argument is so laughable in itself, people who know crime and terrorism will tell you
 magar main soharabuddin kaa mahimamandan nahin karnaa chahta
 There is a saying in English, '
 
 
 doj hu liv baae da gan daai baae da gan,' yani jo bandook or hinsa se sani jindagi jite hai wo waisi hi maut marate hai
 Sohrabuddin was a history sheeter
 
 Was an extortionist
 
 So today if not tomorrow
 
 
 ye uskaa hashr jarur hota
 But the question is whether the countries who kill him are devotees
 gaur kiijie 
 
 
 
 popular bilders ke pramotor raman patel ne kaha he ki unhone amit shah ke khaas ajay patel ko vasuuli ke tahat sattar lakh rupye die the
 And to give this money, the patriotic police officer of BJP was threatened by Vanzara
 paise dene ke baad khud amit shah ne unhen kol kiya tha
 This is not the first charge of recovery on Vanzara
 
 
 isse pehle bhi ye iljaam lagate rahe hai ki wo baqayada amit shah or khud apane str par logon se vasuuli karte rahe hai
 Now consider the number of patriots
 
 On Abhay Chudasama
 
 
 inhen bhi amit shah kii shah hasil thi or ye na sirf extorshan main maahir the, balki inhen fiksar kaha jaataa he, or logon kii postig karaane kaa bhi bharpoor tajurba hasil he inhen
 The same charge is on SP Dinesh MN, who has been accused of extortion by the marble traders of the state
 to ye wo tamaam mahanubhav hai jinhonesoharabuddin ko jananath yaa jahannum kaa rasta dikhaaya or ab ye log bhaajapa ke deshbhakt hai
 i do not know what is the standard of being a patriot
 
 
 magar ye baat tay he ki soharabuddin kii maut isliye nahin hui kyonki wo desh kaa dushman yaa phir 'anemi of di state' tha 
 
 
 
 balki uski maut ke peeche sirf or sirf paisa tha or kuch nahin
 Congress is compelled by its habit
 wo maamle ko muslim rang dene kii koshish kar rahi he or is baat main do raay nahin ki sibiai kaa achaanak is maamle main harakat main aa janaa bihar kii raajnneeti se judaa he
 That is, two aspects of this matter are clear
 congress kaa sharmnaak minority card or bhaajapa kaa haasyaaspad deshbhakti card
 Both great and now the voter has to think on whom to stamp
 magar maaf kijiega
 
 
 Neither this patriotism nor the case of Sohrabuddin is associated with Muslim oppression
 chaliye raajnneeti ke is vahiyaat khel main ham sab shariq hai 
 
 
 
 or ye aage kya rang dikhayega

 He struggled a long time to break the shackles of superstition and stereotypes
 aaie jaane savitri bai phule ke jivan ke bare main ki kis tarah unhone apane sangharsh se manzil pai
 Savitribai Phule was born in January 1831 in a small village called Naigaon in Satara district of Maharashtra
 mahaj 9 saal kii choti umr main puna ke rahane vaale jyotiba phule ke saath unki shaadi ho gai
 At the time of marriage, Savitri Bai Phule was completely illiterate, while her husband had studied up to the third grade
 jis daur main wo padhane kaa sapana dekh rahi thim, tab daliton ke saath bahut bhedbhaav hota tha
 According to an incident at that time, Savitri was turning the pages of an English book one day, when her father saw it
 wo daudkar aae or kitaab haath se chhinakar ghar se baahar phenk di
 The reason behind this is that the right to education belongs only to upper caste men, it was a sin for Dalits and women to get education
 bas usee din wo kitaab waapas laakar pran kar baithi ki kuch bhi ho jaae wo ek na ek din padhanaa jarur seekhengi
 She had the same passion that one day she herself studied with her husband Jyotiba Rao Phule and opened 18 schools for girls
 bataa den, saal 1848 main maharashtra ke pune main desh kaa sabase pehle balika skool kii sthapana kii thi
 At the same time, the eighteenth school was also opened in Pune
 unhone 28 janvari, 1853 ko garbhvatee balaatkaar peediton ke liye bal hatya pratibandhak grih kii sthapana kii
 When they left for school, they ate and said that it was a time when Savitribai Phule went to school, people used to throw stones
 un par gandagi phenk dete the
 Savitribai opened a school for girls at a time when it was not considered right to teach girls
 savitribai phule ek kaviyatri bhi thim
 She was also known as Adikaviyatri of Marathi

 Savitribai took delivery of a widowed Brahmin woman Kashibai at her home while committing suicide and adopted her child Yashwant as her adopted son
 dattak putr yashavanth raav ko paal-poskar inhone doctor banaaya
 Savitribai Phule's husband Jyotirao Phule died in 1890, when Savitribai pledged to complete her unfinished works
 uske baad savitribai kii mrityu 10 march, 1897 ko plig ke marijon kii dekhbhaal karne ke dauraan hui
 His entire life was spent in the struggle for the rights of the deprived sections of the society, especially women and Dalits
 unki ek bahut hi prasiddh kavita he jisamen vah sabko padhane- likhane kii prerana dekar jati todane or brahmanvaadi granthon ko phenkane kii baat karti thim
 Read the Hindi translation of Marathi poetry written on his education
 Go read and write, become self-reliant, do hard work; gather knowledge and wealth; without knowledge, everything is lost; without knowledge we become animals, so do not sit empty, go, go Education end the sufferings of the Lodmitas and the abandoned cows, you have a golden opportunity to learn, so learn and break the bonds of caste, the texts of Brahmins should be as soon as possible
 a Dosatyashodk social setting Kisavitribai Phule and Jyotirao established Satyashodk Society on September 24, 1873
 unhone vidhwaa vivaah kii parampara bhi shuru kii or is sanstha ke dwaara pehla vidhwaa punarvivaah 25 disambar 1873 ko karaayaa gaya
 Jyotiba died on 28 November 1890 due to illness
 jyotiba ke nidhan ke baad satyashodhak samaaj kii jimmedaari savitribai phule par aa gai
 He handled it responsibly
 savitribai ek nipun kaviyitri bhi thim
 He is also considered a pioneer of modern Marathi poetry
 ve apni kavitaaon or lekhon main hameshaa saamaajik chetana kii baat karti thim
 Savitri Bai Phule, being the first female teacher of this country, will be remembered for her whole life in the struggle for the rights of the deprived sections of the society, especially women and Dalits
 filmein samaaj kaa aaina hoti hai lekin kai baar cinema reality se dur jane kaa tarika bhi hota he
 This is the reason that actors are seen in such fabulous costumes in many films that one would hardly think of wearing in normal life
 inamen se zyaadaatar paridhaan period filmon ke hote hai lekin kai commercial filmon main bhi ajeebogareeb fishan sens hota he
 At the same time, there are many costumes that everyone wants to wear, but what happens with these dress of the stars after the shooting of the film is over? That most of these clothes are preserved and labeled with the name of the film
 iske baad in kapadon ko mix match karne ke baad junior artists ke liye istemaal bhi kiya jaataa he or usee production house kii duusari filmon main inkaa istemaal hota he
 However, during this time work on these clothes is done cautiously so that the audience does not feel that this dress has been worn in any other film
 haalanki sabhi kapadon ke saath aisa nahin hota he or kai khaas veshbhushaon ko stars bhi film se judi ek yaadgaar memory ke liye apane paas rakh lete hai
 There are many Bollywood stars who keep a dress attached to the film due to their special attachment to a film

 The 45-year-old actor plays the role of a singer in the film who considers himself Kishore Kumar but the reality is that he is a disloyal singer
 film main kaam karne ko lekar khush yashpal ne bataaya ki haalanki is film main meri bhoomika kaaphi choti he
 He has just gone to promote the film at the 65th Cannes International Film Festival

 china ne islamabad main apane navaniyukt rajdoot ko ek aatankwaadi sanghathan se mili dhamkee ke maddenjar pakistan se unki suraksha badhaane kii maang kii he
 According to media reports, the Chinese Embassy has written this request to Pakistan's Ministry of Home Affairs on 19 October
 usne patr main kaha he ki pratibandhit aatankwaadi sanghathan 'east turkmenistan independent movement’ (itim) kaa ek sadsy uskerajdoot kii hatyakarne ke liye pakistan main ghus chukaa he
 This letter made available to the local media has been written by Ping Ying Fei, the lead actor of the billion-dollar china-pakistan Economic Corridor (SEPEC) scheme
 unhone pakistan ke grih mantralay se chini rajdoot yaao jing or desh main karyrat anya chiniyon ko suraksha badhaane kaa aagrah kiya
 According to the letter, this will not only help in thwarting the nefarious plot of this terrorist but will also help in exposing other terrorists involved in this conspiracy
 china ne yaao jing ko pakistan main apana nayaa rajdoot niyukt kiya he
 He has been Ambassador of China to Afghanistan

 The murder of Bihar BJP vice-president Visheswar Ojha should be taken seriously
 mukhyamantri nitish kumaar kii zimmedaari banati he ki vah is maamle kii tah tak jaanch karaayen
 The murder of any political party, not to show off but to establish it, is a dangerous call for democracy
 uski aapraadhik prishthbhumi ho sakati he lekin uski hatya ko is aadhaar par saamaanya nahin samajha ja saktaa
 It is to be seen whether Ojha was killed in a political rivalry process or due to criminal gang war
 donon hi sthitiyon main khataranaak he lekin agar isamen raajnneetik pratidwandita kaa koi role he to yah bhayaavah he
 If someone is allegedly a criminal and is in politics, then it is the responsibility of the government to bring such cases to an early conclusion
 netaa netaa hota he
 This is why it is important to protect and everyone is accountable that it is an essential element of democracy
 isliye bijepi netaa visheshwar ojha kii hatya kisi bhi tareeke se shubhasanket nahin he
 The atmosphere of political assassination will make everyone goth
 tippaniyan The Prime Minister also said in the election campaign that within a year, efforts will be made to bring the case hearing of the leaders to a conclusion
 pradhanmantri hon yaa mukhyamantri koi bhi is prakriya ko mahatv nahin detaa jabaki dena chahie
 Whoever comes into politics should be responsible for protecting the government
 ye or baat he ki jagah jagah par sarkarein ab loktantr ko police tantra ke zariye chalaanaa chaahati hai
 Suppressing opponents is becoming a part of political culture
 hamen har tarah kii vichaardhaara or soch kii jagah kii raksha kerani chahie
 It also means being a democratic citizen
 uski bhoomika yahi honi chahie
 You cannot build a wall of scope as per your convenience
 loktantr kaa matlab hi he had se anhad kii taraf prasthaan karnaa
 Continuously questioning the control of power
 satta yaa sarkaar ishwariya dein nahin he
 It is created from among the people and the government is not the owner of that public
 loktantr main sazaayaftaa hone tak aapraadhik prishthbhumi ke logon ke liye bhi jagah he
 There are such people in every party
 mantri hai or adhyaksh hai
 It is therefore important that the death of Visheshwar Ojha should not be handed over only to police investigation
 sheersh se jaanch kii nigaraanee honi chahie
 It is dangerous in both cases but if there is any role of political rivalry in it then it is frightening
 koi kathith rup se apradhi he or raajnneeti main he to yah javabdehi bhi sarkaar kii he wo aise maamalon ko jaldi nattejey par pahunchaaye
 a leader is a leader
 isaki raksha isliye jaruri he or sabaki javabdehi he ki wo loktantr kaa ek zaruri tatv he
 So the murder of BJP leader Visheshwar Ojha is not a good sign in any way
 raajnneetik hatya kaa maahaul sabko vahashi bana degaa
 The comments pradhanmantri ne bhi chunavi prachaar main kaha tha ki ek saal ke bheetar netaaon ke maamle kii sunwaayee ko nattejey tak pahunchane kaa prayaas kiya jayega
 Whether the Prime Minister or the Chief Minister does not give importance to this process, it should be given
 jo bhi raajnneeti main aata he uski raksha kii zimmedaari sarkaar kii honi chahie
 It is another matter that governments everywhere want to run democracy through police system
 virodhiyon ko dabaanaa raajnneetik samskruti kaa hissaa banataa ja rahaa he
 We must protect every kind of ideology and place of thinking
 loktantric naagarik hone kaa matlab yah bhi he
 That should be his role
 aap apni suvidha anusaar daayre kii diwaar nahin bana sakate
 Democracy simply means to go beyond limits to the infinite
 satta ke niyantran par lagaataar sawaal karte rahanaa
 Power or government is not a divine gift
 uskaa nirmaan lok ke bich se hota he or sarkaar us lok kii maalik nahin he
 There is also room for people of criminal background till the punishment in democracy
 har dal main aise log hai
 Is a minister and is a president
 isliye zaruri he ki visheshwar ojha kii maut ko sirf police jaanch ke hawaale nahin kiya jaae
 The investigation should be monitored from the top
 pradhanmantri ne bhi chunavi prachaar main kaha tha ki ek saal ke bheetar netaaon ke maamle kii sunwaayee ko nattejey tak pahunchane kaa prayaas kiya jayega

 His madness and positive thinking gives me strength
 "from the moment he was born 12 years, 11 months and 8 days ago, my amazing @rockbehl took ownership of my heart
 From then on, his happiness and wellbeing have been the center of anything @goldiebehl and i ever did
 And so, when the Big c reared its ugly head, our biggest dilemma was what and how we were going to tell him
 As much as we wanted to protect him, we knew it was important to tell him the full facts
 We’ve always been open and honest with him and this time it wasn’t going to be different
 He took the news so maturely


 and instantly became a source of strength and positivity for me
 In some situations now, he even reverses roles and takes on being the parent, reminding me of things i need to do! i believe that it’s imperative to keep kids involved in a situation like this
 They are a lot more resilient than we give them credit for
 It’s important to spend time with them and include them, rather than make them wait on the side-lines, not being told yet instinctively knowing everything
 In our effort to protect them from the pain and realities of life, we might end up doing the opposite
 I’m spending time with Ranveer right now, while he’s on summer vacation
 His madness and shenanigans help me # switchonthesunshine

 At the BCCI Special General Meeting on Sunday, it will be clear whether the BCCI will continue its fight against the new revenue model of the ICC or will move towards a reconciliation
 bisisiai sadasyon se is ahm mudde par unki raay lene ke baad champions trophy ke liye bhartiya team ke chayan karne kii baat he, lekin ye sab kis tarah or kaise hoga ye meeting ke baad hi saafe ho sakegaa
 By the way, according to some sources of BCCI, some members are not in favor of pullout from Champions Trophy
 2014 main hue MPA yani members participeshan agreement ke anusaar agar bharat iske khilaaf jaataa he to us par qareeb 2000 karod rupye kaa jurmaana lag saktaa he
 At the same time, according to another faction, the BCCI has the opportunity to fight its fight because after 20 June a new law and constitution will come after which it will not be possible and the important thing is that the BCCI believes that the MPA in 2014 The rules of the ICC have been put on hold due to which the question has to be given to the ICC and not to the BCCI gauratlab he ki khabaron ke mutabik 23 bisisiai sadasyon ne isisi ke khilaaf legal notice bheje jane kaa samarthan kiya he
 
 lekin kyonki supreme court dwaara gathit coa ne bisisiai ko aisa karne se manaa kiya tha
 
 isliye filhal notice nahin bheja gaya he or SGM main is par bhi baat kii jaaegi
 
 vaise aapako ye bhi bataa den ki isse pehle iske liye supreme court dwaara gathit kamity of administrators ne bisisiai ko nirdesh diya tha
 According to the instructions, the BCCI was to hold the selectors' meeting as soon as possible and select the team
 itnaa hi nahin bisisiai se poocha gaya tha ki aakhir dedline nikal jane tak team kaa chayan kyon nahin hua
 Not only this, the COA also questioned the attitude of the BCCI
 or abhi bhi coa ne saafe kaha ki champions trophy se pul out ke bare main bisisiai bilkul naa soche or ye bhi samajhe kii 570 million dollar milanaa ab bisisiai ko mumkin nahin
 According to reports, COA also met members of North and East zones in Delhi
 donon zone bharat ke champions trophy main khilne ke paksh main hai
 At the same time, some members of the BCCI believe that a solution can be found only through dialogue with the ICC
 MPA britain ke kaanoon ke mutabik banaaya gaya tha, isliye bisisiai ne bhi vahiin kii ek lau farm se baatcheet ke baad hi notice bhejne par man banaaya he
 The battle is not only about 35% loss to BCCI but also its dominance
 yahaan jo bhi faisalaa hoga, uskaa asar lambey samay tak bhartiya cricket par dikh saktaa he
 By the way, you should also tell that before this, the Committee of Administrators constituted by the Supreme Court had directed the BCCI
 nirdesh ke mutabiq bisisiai jald se jald chayankartaaon kii baithak karvaa kar team kaa chayan karnaa tha
 Not only this, the BCCI was asked why the team was not selected till the deadline went out
 yahi nahin COA ne bisisiai ke ravaiye par bhi sawaal uthaaya tha
 And still coa has clearly said that the BCCI should not think of a pull-out from the Champions Trophy and also understood that it is no longer possible for the BCCI to get $ 570 million
 khabaron ke mutabik COA ne north or east zone ke sadasyon se dilli main mulaaqaat bhi kii
 Both zones are in favor of playing in India's Champions Trophy
 vahiin bisisiai ke kuch sadasyon kaa maananaa he ki isisi se baatcheet ke zarie hi samaadhaan nikaala ja saktaa he
 The MPA was created according to UK law, so the BCCI has also made up its mind to send a notice only after negotiating with a law firm
 ladaai sirf bisisiai ko hone vaale 35fisadi nuksaan kii hi nahin balki uske varchasv kii bhi he
 Whatever decision will be made here, its effect can be seen on Indian cricket for a long time

 do saal pehle aath saal kii maasoom bacchee ke saath uske ankal dwaara kiye gaye yon shoshan ko court main sabit karnaa aasaan nahin he lekin dilli trial court ne ab us bacchee ke kreyan sketch par bharosa jataate hue aaropee ko paanch saal kii sajaa sunai
 According to this report of The Times of India, this 10 year old child is from Kolkata
 do saal pehle isaki maa kii maut hone ke baad sharaabi pita ne ise chhod diya
 a relative brought here to Delhi for upbringing
 yaheen par ankal ne bacchee ke saath kai baar yon shoshan kiya
 The comments natijatan bacchee ghar se bhaag gai or november 2014 main ek bas main mili
 After that activists associated with child rights sent her to the Children's Home
 vahiin par bacchee ne aapbeetee bataai
 Thereafter there were indications of possible exploitation in medical tests
 2016 main aaropee ko pakadaa gaya lekin aaropee ke vakil ne kaha ki bacchee ko uske khilaaf aarope lagane ke liye sikhaaya-padhaayaa gaya he or is aadhaar par sakasham gavaahi nahin maani ja sakati
 During the court hearing, the child was given paper and crayon sketches to cut time
 unheen main se usne ek sketch main banaaya ki ek choti si bacchee ke haath main gubbaaraa he or uske kapade utarkar alag rakh die gaye hai
 He also engraved this sketch with sad colors
 is sketch ko jaj ne bacchee kii manodasha kaa chithran maanate hue aaropee ko doshi tehraate hue paanch saal kii sajaa sunai or 10 hajaar kaa jurmaana lagaaya
 For the welfare and rehabilitation of the child, the court also ordered compensation of a fixed deposit of three lakh rupees
 bacchee ab children home main rahati he or niyamit rup se skool jaati he
 As a result the child ran away from home and was found in a bus in November 2014
 uske baad bal adhikaron se jude kaaryakartaaon ne usko children home bheja
 At the same time, the child told the incident
 uske baad medical pareekshan main sambhavit shoshan ke sanket mili
 In 2016, the accused was apprehended but the lawyer for the accused said that the child has been taught and taught to press charges against him and cannot be considered competent on this basis
 court main sunwaayee ke dauraan bacchee ko samay kaatane ke liye kaagaj or kreyan sketch die jate the
 Out of them, he made in a sketch that a small child has a balloon in his hand and his clothes are taken off and put away
 usne udhaas rangon se is sketch ko ukera bhi tha
 Taking this sketch as a portrayal of the child's mood, the judge convicted the accused and sentenced him to five years and fined 10,000
 bacchee ke kalyaan or punarvaas ke liye court ne teen lakh rupee ke phixd diposit kaa muaavja dene kaa aadesh bhi diya
 The child now lives in the Children's Home and attends school regularly

 maharashtra kii devendra fadanvis sarkaar shuukravaar ko apane mantrimandal kaa vistaar karne ja rahi he
 It is a matter of relief for the government that the hitherto unhappy Shiv Sena will now take part in the cabinet expansion
 siem or shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare ke bich phone par bhi baat hui he
 Shiv Sena may get the post of Home Minister
 shivasena ke cote se gulab raav patil or arjuna kotkar ko mantri pad milane kii sambhaavna he
 Patil is considered to be the antagonist of Eknath Khadse, as he had fireworks after his resignation from his ministerial post
 is vistaar main bijepi ke varisht netaa pandurang phundakar ko ek baar phir sakriy raajnneeti main laane kii charchaa joro par he
 He may be included in the cabinet in place of Eknath Khadse
 gauratlab he ki pehle bijepi ne do siten gathbandhan ke dalon ke liye chhod rakhi thim, jabaki shivasena apane liye ek atirikt mantrimandal seat kii maang kar rahi thi
 Due to this, the resentment in both parties was brought home, while now Shiv Sena is getting 2 seats
 haalanki yah saaf nahin ho paaya he ki yah ek atirikt seat bijepi cote se milegi yaa gathbandhan cote se
 The names of the leaders whose names are discussed regarding the cabinet expansion can be mentioned in their names, from the BJP account include Pandurang Phundkar (MLC), Subhash Deshmukh, Jayakumar Rawal, Madan Yerawar, Sambhaji Nilangkar Patil, Ravindra Chavan
 jabaki gathbandhan ke dalon main rashtriya samaaj party se mahadev janakar or swabhimani shetakari sanghathan se sadaa bhaau khot ke naam saamne aae hai
 This extension is proving to be a crooked pudding for Fadnavis
 kyonki rajya main uski sahyogi shivasena naaraaz he
 It is believed that BJP may add another party minister to the cabinet to allay the displeasure of Shiv Sena
 bijepi paanch khaali padon par docabinetmantri or 3 rajyamantriyon ko rakh sakati he
 The Shiv Sena was given 10 posts at the time of government formation
 isamen se 8 par pehle hi shivasena ke mantri hai
 Currently 5 Shiv Sena ministers are in the cabinet and 3 have the rank of Minister of State
 ab shivasena ke hisse main 2 rajyamantriyon kii jagah khaali he
 But the Shiv Sena is adamant on including its two ministers in the cabinet
 sahyogi dalon kaa badha davaabashivsena ke alaavaabijepike upar anya chote sahyogi dalon kaa bhi dabaav bana hua he
 Parties like Swabhimani Shetkari Sangathan and RSP are also demanding their share
 aise main mana ja rahaa he ki donon sahyogi dalon ke ek-ek sadsy ko cabinet main shaamil kiya ja saktaa he
 If Shiv Sena's demand is not met, it can create uproar once again
 maharashtra main agle saal nigam chunaav hone hai
 In such a situation, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis will try to balance
 taaki kisi bhi dal ko naaraaz na kiya jaae

 Everyone knows about the nine forms of Maa Durga and these forms of Maa are worshiped in Navratri
 hindu dharm main navadurga pujan ke samay hi maa ke mandiron main bhi bhakton kaa tantaa lagata he or unamem bhi maa ke shaktipeethon kaa mahatv alag hi mana jaataa he
 The holy Shakti Peethas are established at different places across India
 devi puraana main 51 shaktipeethon kaa varnan he to devi bhagwat main 108 or devi gita main 72 shaktipeethon kaa varnan miltaa he, vahiin tantra chudamani main 52 shaktipeeth bataae gaye hai
 According to Devi Purana some of the 51 Shaktipeeths are also established abroad
 bharat main 42, pakistan main 1, bangladesh main 4, srilanka main 1, tibet main 1 tathaa nepal main 2 shaktipeeth hai
 According to a legend of 51 Shaktipeeths of Shaktipeeth's mythological story, Mother Durga was born as Sati and was married to Lord Shiva as the daughter of King Prajapati Daksha
 ek baar muniyon ke ek samooh ne yajna yojit kiya
 All the deities were invoked in the yajna
 jab raja daksh aae to sabhi log khadey ho gaye lekin bhagwaan shiv khadey nahin hue
 Lord Shiva was Daksha's son-in-law
 yah dekh kar raja daksh behad krodhit hue
 Sati's father Raja Prajapati Daksha also organized a yagna to avenge his humiliation
 us yajna main brahma, vishnu, indra or anya devi-devataaon ko aamantrit kiya, lekin unhone jaan-boojhkar apane jamaata bhagwaan shiv ko is yajna kaa nimantran nahin bheja
 Lord Shiva did not participate in this yagna and when Sati came to know from Narada ji that his father was having a yagna but he was not invited
 yah jaanakar ve krodhit ho uthin
 Narada advises him that there is no need to invite the father to go here
 jab sati apane pita ke ghar jane lageen tab bhagwaan shiv ne unhen samajhaayaa lekin vah nahin maani to prabhu ne swayan jane se inkaar kar diya
 Even after stopping Shankar Ji, Sati went to join the sacrificial fire
 yajna-sthal par sati ne apane pita daksh se shankar ji ko aamantrit na karne kaa kaaran poocha or pita se ugr virodh prakat kiya
 At this Daksha started talking abusive things about Lord Shankar in front of Sati
 is apmaan se peeditsati ne yajna-kunda main kudakar apni pranahuti de di
 When Lord Shankar came to know of this, his third eye opened with anger
 bramhand main pralay va haahaakaar much gaya
 On Shiva's orders, Virbhadra cut off Daksha's head and also punished the other gods for hearing Shiva's condemnation
 bhagwaan shankar ne yajyakund se sati ke parthiv sharir ko nikaal kandhe par uthaa liya or duhkhi hokar saare bhumandal main ghoomane lage
 Bhagwati Sati appeared to Shiva and said that wherever the parts of his body fall apart, a superpower will arise
 sati kaa shav lekar shiv prithvi par ghoomte hue tandav bhi karne lage, jisase prithvi par pralay kii sthiti utpann hone lagi
 Seeing the distraught of the three worlds, including the earth, Lord Vishnu, with his Sudarshan Chakra, broke Sati's body and broke it on the earth
 jab-jab shiv nrity mudra main pair patakate, vishnu apane chakra se mata ke sharir kaa koi ang katkar uske tukade prithvi par gira dete
 According to the scriptures, wherever the parts of Jahsati fell, their clothes or ornaments fell, there emerged the Shaktipeeth
 is tarah kul 51 sthanon main mata ke shaktipeethon kaa nirmaan hua
 In the next birth, Sati was born as Parvati to the house of King Himalayas and got Shiva again as a husband by doing severe penance
 basapa supremeo mayawati or sapa pramukh akhilesh yadav ne lakhanu main shanivaar ko saajha press conference kii
 During this, both parties made a formal announcement to contest the upcoming Lok Sabha elections together
 mayawati ne kaha ki basapa aagaamee loksabhaa chunaavon main ek baar phir sapa ke saath gathbandhan karne kaa faisla kiya he
 In the coming times, this alliance will be considered as a time of new political revolution
 isi press conference ke dauraan mayawati ne ek sawaal ke jawaab main kaha ki sapa or basapa kaa gathbandhan sthaayee he
 The alliance will not only contest the 2019 general elections but also the 2022 assembly elections
 haalanki jab yahi sawaal akhilesh yadav se kiya gaya to unhone kaha ki abhi yah gathbandhan agle loksabhaa chunaav ke liye tay kiya gaya he
 Announcing the alliance for Lok Sabha elections 2019, Mayawati said that SP-BSP will contest 38-38 seats in UP
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki yah gathbandhan amethi or raibareli main congress ke khilaaf koi ummidavaar nahin utaaregaa
 While 2 seats will be left for the allies
 bataa den ki uttar pradesh main loksabhaa kii 80 siten hai
 Mayawati said, 'on January 4, there was a meeting in Delhi
 usee baithak main donon dalon ne gathbandhan main chunaav ladane kaa faisla kiya tha
 We have aligned all the 80 Lok Sabha seats of the state
 isaki bhanak shaayad bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ko lag gai thi, jisaki vajah se hamaare sahyogi akhilesh yadav kii chhavi dhoomil karne ke liye jabaran unka naam khanan ghotaale main ghasita gaya
 'why not in alliance? During the Congress conference, former UP CM Mayawati also gave a reason for not joining Congress in the alliance
 unhone bataaya ki congress ke raaj main ghoshit immergency thi or ab (modi sarkaar main) aghoshit
 Litigation against effective opponents by harassing government machinery is disturbing by uprooting it
 congress ke saath sapa-basapa gathbandhan kaa koi khaas phayda nahin hota
 Our vote gets transferred, but the Congress vote is not transferred or is transferred elsewhere under internal strategy
 mayawati ji kaa apmaan meraa apmaanah akhileshwahin uttar pradesh ke purv mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ne kaha, 'gathbandhan kaa man to usee din ban gaya tha jis din bijepi ke netaaon ne mayawati ji par ashobhaneey tippanee kii thi or bijepi ne apane netaaon par karrwai karne ke bajaay unhen mantri banaakar inaam diya tha
 Instead of punishing its undisciplined leaders, BJP honored them by giving them big portfolios
 ' sapa mukhiya ne kaha, 'gathbandhan kaa man usee din pakkaa ho gaya tha, jab rajyasabha main bhimrao ambedkar ko chal se haraaya gaya tha
 It is thanks to Mayawati ji that she has accepted equality
 aaj se mayawati ji kaa apmaan meraa apmaan hoga
 'let us tell you that the BSP and SP have also fought the 1993 assembly elections together

 However, on 2 June 1995, the BSP withdrew from the government and announced a withdrawal of support

 This astronomical event will start this solar eclipse at 9:16 in the night and will last till 02:34 in the morning
 yah grahan haalanki bharat main dikhaai nahin degaa
 According to astronomers, this eclipse will be seen in full form in North America, West America, South America, some parts of Europe and North, West Africa
 lekin iskaa matlab yah nahin ki iskaa koi prabhaav aap par nahin padegaa
 Today, the first solar eclipse of the year, know why not to do these works in the important eclipse, according to the scriptures, many things are forbidden to be done during solar eclipse
 isamen khaanaa-pinaa, ishwar kii murti ko choona aadi bhi shaamil he
 You will probably be surprised to know that romance or sex is also forbidden during solar eclipse
 kaaran bhi janengrahan ke dauraan romance kyon nahin karnaa chahie is par jyotishacharya vinod mishra ne bataaya ki is sawaal par koi jyotishiya tark dena thik nahin
 There are definitely scientific arguments
 darasal, grahan ke dauraan kai prakaar kii nakaaratmak urjaaen prithvi par padati hai
 That is, negative energy will be flowing around you wherever you are during that time
 ab nakaaratmak urja ke bich bhojan karnaa, bhojan pakaana, mastishk par jor dene vaale kaam karne se sharir par prabhaav padate hai
 Today is the first solar eclipse of the year, keep pregnant women, why not pay attention to these things, if you have sexual intercourse, then it should not be done at all, otherwise the child can be affected
 grahan ke dauraan kareeb aane se baccha aapng paidaa ho saktaa he, wo maansik taur par swasthya nahin hoga yaa phir bhautik rup se puri tarah thik nahin hoga
 Getting close to you, even if you don't have a child's plan, can have a bad effect on your partner's brain

 congress kii samvaad baithak main sonia gandhi or manmohan singh ke baad jiske samvaad par congress kii nazren tiki thi, wo hai rahul gandhi
 Generally silent on big issues, Rahul fiercely advocated for economic reforms and on the issue of elections asked party leaders to prepare to fight till the end
 sonia or manmohan ke baad samvaad kaa ye sammaan rahul gandhi ko hi mila
 All the Congress leaders said to speak on Sonia's teasing, but everyone's eyes were fixed on Rahul what he said
 sutron ke mutabik, jis epadiai par bavaal machaa he, uske bachaav main khulkar saamne aae rahul gandhi or wo bhi itihaas ke kai pannon ko kholte hue
 Rahul Gandhi said that there is no need for the government to hesitate on the issue of reform
 apni daadi indira gandhi kaa hawala dete hue rahul ne kaha ki 1969 main bainkon ke rashtriyakaran ke samay bhi virodhiyon ne kam hangaamaa nahin machaaya tha
 Rahul also discussed economic reforms in the 1990s by the Congress, against which the opposition was incited
 rahul ke mutabik, jab rajeev gandhi ne computer laayaa to bhi trahimam karne waalon kii kami nahin thi
 In the era of communication gap, this dialogue of Rahul must have been working as a livelihood for the Congress leaders

 According to information received by Aaj Tak, Rahul was also in a cross mood in that closed meeting

 While some political parties are questioning the credibility of evms, the Election Commission has also categorically denied any tampering of evms
 yahaan tak ki ayog ne sawaal uthaane vaale raajnneetik dalon ko EVM main kisi bhi tarah kii chhedchhad kerani kii khuli chunauti tak de daali he
 Former Chief Election Commissioner MS Gill, who held EVM for the first time in Tamil Nadu assembly elections in 1997, bluntly stated that EVM was still the safest and even now, the questioners have changed
 unhone kaha ki EVM ne jab satta main baithaaya to EVM acchhee or sachhee thi agar haar gaye to EVM bekaar or juthi ho gai
 Congress leader MS Gill said when he was the Chief Election Commissioner when elections were held for the first time from EVM in 1997, then he himself took to the streets in Jaipur to know the quality of EVM and the public's reaction to the seal versus machine
 gali ke nukkadon par tamboo lagaakar mahilaon ko bula-bulaakar kehete the ki jaao jaakar naye tareeke se vot daalkar aao
 Then he was able to know the experience of the voters
 in 20 saalon main EVM kigunvattta or suraksha or majboot hui he
 MS Gill said that every Election Commissioner has increased something in it
 ab to VVPAT kaa feechar bhi jud gaya he phir bhi chunaav main haarane vaali partiyaan or unke netaa is par sawaal uthaa rahe hai
 While the most powerful brand of Make in India is EVM
 gil ne iviem kaa bachaav karte hue kaha ki itani badi taadaad main mashine hai ki kisi afasar ko ye nahin pataa hota ki koun si EVM kidar jaani he, aise main koi kaise gadabad kar saktaa he
 He said that the producer company cannot make changes in the chip itself after programming once
 ye us prayog kii gai sidi or dividi jaisaa hi hota he jise ririte karne kaa koi vikalp hi nahin he
 In such a situation, all the allegations of disturbances and molestation are baseless
 purv mukhya chunaav ayukta gil ko jab pataa chalaa ki congress netaa or desh ke purv kanoon mantri virappa moili ne bhi EVM kaa samarthan kiya he to pehle unhen is baat kii hairaani hui lekin unhone is par afni khushi bhi jaahir kii
 Gill said those who find flaws in EVM should go to court
 agar court kaa aadesh hoga to shikayatakarta ko EVM kholane or khilne ko bhi muhaiyaa kara di jaaegi or phir wo khud jor aazamaa kar dekh le
 If successful, the Commission will make EVM more secure or else its credibility will remain as before

 a surprising case has emerged in Pakistan
 yahaan bhartiya ucchayog kii iftaar party main aae mehmaanon ke saath pakistani adhikariyon ne badasluki kii
 The Iftar party was organized by the officials of the Indian High Commission at the Serena Hotel in Islamabad
 isamen shaamil hone ke liye kai mehmaanon ko nyauta diya gaya tha
 When the guests started coming before the Iftar party started, the Pakistani security agencies acted disgusting
 report ke mutabik kai mehmaanon ke saath dhakka-mukki kii gai, kai logon kii kai baar jaanch kii gai to kai logon ko andar hi nahin aane diya gaya
 During this time there was a heated debate between the guests, Indian officials and security officials of Pakistan
 pakistani adhikariyon kii is harakat par pakistan main bharat ke ucchayukta ajay bisaaria ne khed bhi jataayaa
 a video about this is also becoming quite viral on social media
 is video main ajay bisaaria kah rahe hai, 'main un logon kaa shukriya karata hum jo yahaan aae hai
 Especially those who have come from Karachi and Lahore
 saath hi maafee bhi maangana chaahunga kyonki kai logon ko yahaan andar aane main takalif hui or kai dost yahaan hi nahin aa paae
 The series of Iftar continues here for many years
 'haalanki ye pehla maamla nahin he jab bhartiya rajanyikon ke saath pakistani agenciyaan ne badasluki kii ho
 Earlier, a case of disconnecting the power of their houses to harass diplomats was also revealed

 Pakistan was not invited recently when Narendra Modi was sworn in as PM on May 30

 They would have come close to victory, but then the victory would have slipped from their hands

 He is the maternal brother of Gaganjeet Singh
 midfield main khelte-khelte ve dragoflikar ke taur par puri duniya ko apana divaana bana rahe hai
 Know what makes them special and what you can learn from them
 
 
 1
 Strong practice
 
 
 ve international muqablon ke liye khud ko taiyaar kar rahe hon yaa phir nahin
 They never miss practice
 practice unke liye roj kii puja kii tarah he
 Perhaps this is the reason why he has gone to the maximum dragflicker of the world while playing in the middle
 2
 Doing the same thing continuously
 
 
 dragoflic hockey kii ek aisi vidha he jisamenshuruaati shotbahut miss hote hai
 In such a situation, instead of getting desperate, the effort has to be continued
 ve bhi kuch aise hi hai
 3
 team or coach se saamanjasy
 
 
 Obviously hockey is a team game
 aap akele dam par 1 yaa 2 gol bhale hi kar sakate hai, magar jeet to team ke acha khilne par hi naseeb hoti he
 Apart from this, they always keep the advice of the coach or their mentor
 unke aisa karne se unka game bhi impruve hua he

 rafel par chal rahi raar supreme court ke faisle ke baad bhi jari he
 While the Congress is demanding a JPC on this issue, the central government is rejecting this demand after the Supreme Court's decision
 ab vitt mantri arun jetali ne bhi congress kii maang thukaraate hue fasebuk post ke jariye karaara hamalaa kiya he
 Jaitley said that the decision of the court is final and after that the opinion of the CAG is of no use
 unhone fasebuk par apane lekh main kaha ki congress jhooth failaane ke apane pehle prayaas main vifal rahi or ab nyaayalay ke ‘nirnay par nae jhooth garh rahi he
 'it is worth noting that the first four days of the Winter Session of Parliament have been an uproar over Rafale and some other issues
 jetali ne kaha ki vipakshi congress sansad ke shesh satr main rafel par charchaa ke bajaay hangaamaa karnaa chaahegi
 The Congress was not the petitioner in the Rafale case in the Supreme Court
 congress chaahati he ki rafel maamle kii jaanch ke liye jepisi banaayi jaae, taaki bhaajapa sarkaar ne jis keemat par ladaaku jet vimaan kharidne kaa qaraar kiya he, uski tulana congress ke netritv vaali sanyukt pragatisheel gathbandhan (samprag) sarkaar ke dauraan in vimaanon kii keemat par hui baatcheet se kii ja sake
 The Congress says that the JPC probe will also explain how the Anil Ambani group has been selected to be the offset partner of Rafale's French company in the deal
 jetali ne apane fasebuk post kii heading di he- ‘rafel- jhooth, thode samay tak chalaa jhooth tathaa aage or jhooth?’’ unhone likhaa he ki ucchtam nyaayalay ne is par antim shabd kah diya he or usase isaki vaidhata siddh ho chuki he
 No political body can conclude contrary to the Supreme Court's conclusion
 ’’ucchtam nyaayalay ke faisle main is ‘aspashtataa’ ke daawey par ki is vishay kii samiksha kaig ne kar lee he or ab yah PAC ko bheja gaya he
 To this, Jaitley said that defense deals go to the CAG for audit and who sends his report to PAC
 jetali ne kaha ki is baat ko sarkaar ne tathyaatmak rup se or puri tarah sahi dhang se sarvocch adaalat ke samaksh rakhaa tha
 Rafael's audit investigation is pending before the CAG
 uske saath sabhi tathy saajha kiye gaye hai
 When the CAG report comes, it will be sent to the PAC
 iske baavjood yadi adaalat ke aadesh main kisi tarah kii visangati he, to koi bhi nyaayalay ke samaksh use thik karwaane ke liye apil kar saktaa he
 He said that the correct picture has been placed before the court and it is now up to the discretion of the court to state at what stage the CAG review is pending
 unhone kaha ki prakriya, keemat or afaset aapurtikarta par (nyaayalay ke) antim nishkarshon ke sambandh main kaig kii raay kaa koi myne nahin he
 But those who are defeated by defeat never accept the truth
 tamaam tarah ke jhooth main vifal hone ke baad ab unhone nyaayalay ke faisle par sawaal uthaanaa shuru kar diya he
 Jaitley said that after failing in its initial lie, the Congress is fabricating many more lies about the verdict
 unhone kaha ki congress ne tathyon par jhooth bolaa
 The Supreme Court's decision has exposed the weakness of the Congress party in the debate on defense deals
 desh ko congress kii viraasat or uske raksha saudon ke bare main bataane kaa bada acha mauka he
 This is a really good opportunity for people like me to speak on this

 - Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) June 28, 2015 argedy supremeo lalu prasad yadav or unki patni rabari devi ne mangalvaar ko apane donon bete tejasvi or tejpratap ko tilak lagaakar janadesh apmaan yatra par ravaanaa kiya
 During this visit, Tejashwi and Tej Pratap will speak out against Chief Minister Nitish Kumar
 donon bhai janata ko bataaenge ki kis tareeke se nitish ne bijepi ke saath sarkaar bana kar 2015 main mahagathbandhan ko mili janadesh kaa apmaan kiya he
 The yatra will officially begin on 9 August
 patna se champaran ke liye ravaanaa hone ke baadatejasvi or tejpratapane ajtak se khaas baatcheet kii
 Tejashwi said that Nitish Kumar has lost his credibility by insulting the mandate given to the grand alliance
 nitish ne janata ke bharose ko tod diya he
 Tejashwi said that all the corruption cases made against his family are part of the conspiracy of Nitish and BJP
 tejasvi ne kaha ki nitish ne unhen mohare ke rup main istemaal kiya taaki vah mahagathbandhan se alag ho saken or bhaajapa ke saath sarkaar bana saken
 Attacking Nitish from 'hare Ram to Jai Shri Ram', Tejaswi said that Nitish did not delay in doing 'hey Ram to Jai Shri Ram'
 lalu ke bete ne nitish ko aagaah kiya ki jis tareeke se nitish ne 2013 main bhaajapa se gathbandhan tod diya tha usee prakaar is baar bhaajapa bhi bahut jald nitish kumaar kaa saath chhod degi
 Tejashwi said that Nitish Kumar has made the biggest mistake of his political career by going with BJP and by doing so his image has also become tainted
 'nitish kaa janaadhar nahin'nitish par tanj kasate hue tejasvi ne kaha ki unka khud kaa bihar main kuch bhi janaadhar nahin he
 He always becomes the chief minister only with the help of others
 tejasvi ne daawa kiya ki jediu ke alag hone se mahagathbandhan par koi asar nahin padegaa
