 Video: Why is the higher education budget continuously decreasing? Video: Why is the higher education budget continuously decreasing? swatantraaa diwas bhaashan main pradhanmantri narendra modi ne kareeb 82 minute tak desh ko sambodhit kiya
 This speech of PM Modi was seen to be very sedate, in which there was more talk of the government's functioning than criticism
 piem modi ke is bayaan main aise kai shabd yaa mudde sunai nahin die, jinaki na sirf ummid kii ja rahi thi, balki jo vivaad or charchaa kaa vishay bhi bane
 Mob lynching In recent times, the term has been the most disputed and discussed, on the basis of which opposition parties are constantly criticizing the Modi government
 yahaan tak ki piem modi ne bhi haal hi main apane ek intervyuu main is tarah kii ghatnaon ko galat tehraaya tha, lekin aaj jab unhone laal kile ke pracheer se desh ko sambodhit kiya, to yah shabd kahin najar nahin aayaa
 All the leaders of the Cow and Ganga Bharatiya Janata Party have been raising the issue of cow protection
 yahaan tak ki piem modi haal hi main jab rwanda desh kii yatra par gaye the, to unhone vahaan ke graminon ko 200 gaay uphaar main di thi
 On the other hand, not only has the cow been discussed extensively in the country in the last four years, but such incidents have come to light when innocent people have been killed in the name of cow protection
 piem modi bhi goraksha ke naam par kanoon haath main lene waalon kii saarvajanik manch se aalochana kar chuke hai, lekin aaj ke bhaashan main piem modi ne aisa koi pahalu nahin chune kaa prayaas nahin kiya
 At the same time, after the change of power in 2014, the Modi government started the National Ganga Cleanliness Mission Program in its initial days
 abhi halaat ye hai ki ganga kii nirmalata main deree kii ko lekar charchaa he
 However, Nitin Gadkari is claiming that 70 percent of Ganga will be cleared before March 2019
 kisaan aatmahatyapiem modi ne apane bhaashan main kaha ki kisaanon ko dedh guna emspi kii filein saalon se lataki hui thim or hamaari sarkaar ne hamane ise lagu karne kaa faisla kiya
 He also said that today our whole focus is to bring change and modernization in the agriculture sector and we have dreamed of doubling the income of farmers for 75 years of independence
 lekin desh main kisaanon kii aatmahatya par unke bhaashan main kuch sunne ko nahin mila
 Pakistan During the 2014 Lok Sabha election campaign, PM Modi made Pakistan a big issue
 yahaan tak ki unhone tatkaaleen upie sarkaar kii is masale par jamkar aalochana kii thi
 After this, when the BJP government was formed under his leadership, our soldiers went to the surgical strike by going across the border against Pakistan, but now that there is going to form a new government under the leadership of a former cricketer and from across the border in Kashmir Valley Conspiracies are constantly happening to promote terrorism, PM Modi did not mention Pakistan on any issue
 alpsankhyaksabakaa saath, sabakaa vikaas naare ke saath or sava sau karod deshavaasiyon ko saath lekar chalane kii baat kehane vaale piem modi ke bhaashan main alpsankhyak shabd sunai nahin diya
 He mentioned only three divorced Muslim women in relation to this section of society
 haalanki, is mudde par unhone muslim mahilaon ke haq kii awaad bahut buland andaaj main uthaai
 NRC Assam's National Citizen Register (NRC) is the latest issue, which is being politically fierce
 enarasi se 40 logon kaa bhavishya judaa he, jo philhal assam main rah rahe hai, lekin unke paas bhartiya hone ke saboot nahin paae gaye hai
 While the BJP is linking it with the security of the country, the Congress and other opposition parties, including the Trinamool Congress, are calling this move of the Modi government a step to exclude citizens of the country
 chunaavdesh main ekasaath loksabhaa or vidhansabha chunaav ko lekar piem modi ne purajor tareeke se aawaaj uthaai he
 Recently, the National President of the Bharatiya Janata Party Amit Shah has written a letter to the Law Commission, describing the benefits of the election together
 unhone ayog se kaha he ki isse chunavi kharch par kami aegi or sangheey swaroop ko majbootee milegi
 However, the Election Commission has said that in the current situation it is not possible to conduct simultaneous elections in the country
 ab jabaki 2019 kaa loksabhaa chunaav kareeb he or ekasaath chunaav kii sambhaavnaaon par charchaa bhi ho rahi thi, lekin piem modi ke bhaashan main chunaav yaa ek saath chunaav se judi koi baat shaamil nahin thi

 Yuvraj's father Yograj Singh targeted Team India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni on this occasion and Yuvraj's worldcup main na khel paane ke liye captain mahendra singh dhoni ko doshi tehraaya
 Yograj Singh said "dhoni does not want Yuvraj Singh to come into Team India and today if Yuvraj Singh is not in Team India then only Dhoni is responsible for this
 " With this statement of the father, the astonished Yuvraj soon cleared his position by tweeting
 yuvi ne twit kar kaha, "har pita kii tarah mere pita bhi bhavuk hai or isiilie unhone aisa kaha
 i have played under Dhoni's captaincy before and if i get the chance even further, i will happily play in his team
 " By the way, Yograj Singh is not the first person who has said so, but Yuvi's entire focus is on his game and would prefer to answer with his bat

 The model of all is the same but now every state will have the same type of tax system named GST

 This change will affect the general consumer as well as small factories and products running from large companies to village towns

 The more confusion will come to the common shopkeeper, the more trouble can be faced by the tax authorities

 One tax is being imposed or a uniform system of taxation is being introduced

 Because even under GST the taxes of the center are different

 GST is an umbrella under which there are many commands or GST is an umbrella without any command

 Understand and in practice
 samvidhan kaa 122waan sanshodhan bill rajyasabha main pesh kar diya gaya he

 For this, training of officers has also started
 centre sarkaar ko do jiesti kanoon banane hai
 Central GST and Inter State g ST
 rajya sarkaron ko apane apane yahaan state jiesti kanoon paas karwaanaa hoga
 But before that the draft of these three laws will be discussed in the GST Council
 jiesti council main kisi mudde ko teen chauthai maton se hi paas karaayaa ja sakegaa
 Two-thirds of the voting rights have been given to the states
 ek tihaai matdaan kaa adhikaar centre ke paas rahegaa
 Without the broad consent of both, no proposal will be passed in the GST Council
 centre kaa rajyon par vito hoga or rajyon kaa centre par
 The Finance Minister has said that GST will be implemented as soon as the information technology is set up after these three laws are enacted and implemented
 unhone koi taarikh to nahin bataai magar kaha ki bahut der nahin hogi
 Many people say that there may be a new tax system coming into existence
 ek se teen saal kaa vakt lag jaae
 Because what will be the same rate now, the decision has to be made in the GST Council
 samaan tex rate ko lekar lagata nahin ki ek do baithkon main maamla tay ho jayega
 In a way, will the budget of states now be made in the GST Council

 BJD MP AU Singh Dev said why the Center should have veto power
 
 
 
 States should have more veto power

 Economist Narendra Jadhav said that GDP 1 from the implementation of GST
 5 pratishat se do pratishat tak bad jaaegi
 For governments, the scope of tax collection will increase and black money will decrease
 par narendra jadhav ne yah bhi kaha ki sirf jiesti se arthvyavastha kii sari buraaiyaan dur nahin ho jaaengi
 Wherever GST is not implemented properly there is no benefit
 narendra jadhav ne kaha ki agar jiesti rate adhik hua to garib logon par maar padegi
 If the tax rate is higher in the service sector, the economy will be harmed
 thode samay ke liye swasthya, shiksha or kapadaa kaaphi mahangaa ho saktaa he
 Speaking on behalf of the Congress party, P
 Chidambaram has appealed to the government to add a standard tax rate of 18 percent to the bill itself
 duniya bhar main tex rate 14
 1 to 16
 8 pratishat he
 The maximum rate should also be fixed in India
 agar jiesti aane ke baad bhi 24 se 26 pratishat kaa tex lagata rahe to koi laabh nahin hoga
 Chidambaram said that 57 per cent of GDP comes from the service sector
 agar sarvice tex 14
 If it increases from 5 to 24 percent then inflation will increase
 isliye 70 fisadi vastu or sevaaon par 18 fisadi se adhik tex nahin laganaa chahie
 CPM MP Sitaram Yechury underlined the cuts in states' authority over GST
 unhone kaha ki tex tay karne kaa adhikaar rajya kaa hona chahie
 Yechury referred to Dr
 Ambedkar's statement in the Constituent Assembly on sales tax
 unhone kaha, 'mujhe aisa lagata he ki agar ham praanton ko cells tex lagane dete hai tab praant ko azaadi honi chahie ki ve apni sthitiyon ke anusaar cells tex kii daron main badlaav kar saken
 Therefore, if the ceiling is imposed by the Center, then there will be a lot of problems regarding sales tax
 behatar he cells tex tay karne kaa adhikaar praanton ke paas rahe kyonki centre ke paas paryaapt sansaadhan hote hai
 Yechury says that states will no longer have the right to sales tax
 rajya apana sansaadhan kaise badhayega
 Yechury said that GST is an indirect tax
 iske kaaran garibon par boj padataa he
 Like the Finance Minister said that 37 in India
 7 pratishat kar pratyaksh kar se aata he
 What you know as income tax
 62
 3 percent comes from indirect tax, sales tax, VAT tax, etc
 indonesia jaise desh main pratyaksh kar kaa hissaa 55
 8 percent, 57 in South Africa
 5 pratishat he
 Yechury was arguing that at one time the GST rate in the House itself was stated to be 27 percent
 agar aisa hua to arthvyavastha charmara jaaegi
 So all these arguments were given
 ashanka or sambhaavna ko lekar baaten hui
 Changes in the tax system are now fixed
 kya hoga ham nahin jaanate hai
 GST was introduced in France only in 1954
 france kii jidipi 1

 saare bhaashan to nahin sune lekin jitne bhi vaktaaon ko suna unki baton main duniya bhar main jiesti ke kya anubhav rahe hai iskaa naam maatr kaa hi zikr rahaa
 As a citizen, we were deprived of knowing the experiences of those countries
 hamen nahin maaloom ki jin 140 deshon main jiesti lagu hui kya sabhi kii jidipi main oochaal aayaa
 What is the basis of the claim of a one and a half to two per cent jump after GST in India
 kya un deshon main kar chori kam ho gai, kaala dhan kam ho gaya
 There is no doubt that the Indian tax system needs basic reforms
 kya ab se chungi samaapt ho jaaegi
 No one will stop the trucks
 kar chori nahin hogi
 Millions of people work in small and medium scale industries
 un chote kaarkaanon ko kya vaisaa hi laabh hoga jo bade kaarkaanon ko hoga
 New system
 iske nae nae anubhav honge or sudhaar hota chalegaa
 Such a big change cannot be accomplished all at once, but we can talk about the virtues and the faults
 taaki ham sabaki is masale par samaj behatar ho
 If you want to read about its possibilities, then you can read the article of Sachin Bansal of Flipkart which was featured in Economic Times on 25 July
 jisamen wo daawa karte hai ki jiesti se i-kamrs main bhayankar oochaal aayega
 He says that the tax system will be better than GST, which will benefit every sector
 sakht aalochana padhani ho to aap 19 disambar 2015 ke rose kaich news par chape devendra sharma kaa lekh pard sakate hai
 The 122nd Amendment Bill of the Constitution has been introduced in the Rajya Sabha
 yah bill loksabhaa main paas ho chukaa he
 The Finance Minister said that it is not a surrender of sovereignty of the states but the Center and the states are moving together towards a better and modern tax system
 jisase zyaada rajasav paidaa hoga or bhartiya arthvyavastha ko gati milegi
 GST will make the movement of products in India easier than ever
 kar chori band ho jaaegi
 There will be a round of taxation on Inspector Raj and tax
 isse centre or rajya donon ko laabh hoga
 After passing the Rajya Sabha, the President will send it to the Legislative Assembly of all states
 jinamein se 15 vidhansabhaon ko manzuri deni hogi
 After that the work of forming GST Council will begin
 jiesti council ke liye naukarshahi kaa nayaa dhaancha centre or rajya main banegaa
 For example, there will be posts like Principal Chief Commissioner of Central GST at the center, then the state will be the State GST Commissioner
 iske liye adhikariyon kaa prashikshan shuru bhi ho chukaa he
 The central government has to enact two GST laws
 central jiesti or inter state ji asti
 State governments will have to get the state GST law passed by themselves
 lekin usase pehle in teenon kanoonon ke draft par jiesti council main charchaa hogi
 In GST Council, any issue can be passed with three fourths of votes
 do tihaai matdaan kaa adhikaar rajyon ko diya gaya he
 One-third of the voting rights will remain with the center
 bina donon kii vyapak sahmati ke jiesti council main koi prastaav paas nahin ho sakegaa
 The Center will have a veto on the states and the states on the center
 vitt mantri ne kaha he ki in teenon kanoonon ke banane ke baad or ise lagu karne ke liye information technalji kaa dhaancha khadaa hote hi jiesti lagu kar di jaegiri
 He did not give any date but said that it will not be too late
 kai logon kaa kahana he ki nai kar pranali ke vajood main aane main ho saktaa he
 It takes one to three years
 kyonki abhi wo samaan dar kya hogi iskaa faisla jiesti council main hona he
 Regarding the same tax rate, it does not seem that the matter will be decided in one or two meetings
 ek tarah se rajyon kaa bajet kya ab jiesti council main banane lagegaa
 non-bjp and non-congress parties have raised questions about the right of states
 bijedy saansad e you singh dev ne kaha ki centre ke paas vito power kyon hona chahie
 
 
 
 rajyon ko zyada vito power hona chahie
 bsp's Satish Mishra said that the GST Council should have the post of Vice Chairman, which is different from the party running the government at the center and the opposition party so as to keep the balance
 ensipi ke prafull patel ne kaha ki brihan mumbai munisapal corporation kaa rajasav kai rajyon se zyada he
 If money is not received on time, then the work of cities like Mumbai will stop
 shivasena ne bhi kaha ki jiesti ke zariye mumbai ko kamazor karne kii koshish ho rahi he, mumbai ne kabhi centre se paisa nahin maanga lekin ab mumbai kaa kya hoga
 Trinamool Congress MP Derek o'brien called the GST a chameleon settlement tax
 unki party jiesti kii samarthak rahi he lekin derek o bryan kaa kahana tha ki ise lekar congress or bijepi ne bacchon si raajnneeti kii he
 It should be implemented immediately
 arthshaastri narendra jadhav ne kaha ki jiesti lagu hone se jidipi 1
 Will increase from 5 percent to two percent
 sarkaron ke liye tex vasuuli kaa dayera bad jayega or kaala dhan ghatega
 But Narendra Jadhav also said that only the GST will not remove all the evils of the economy
 jahaan bhi jiesti thik se lagu nahin hua he vahaan iskaa phayda nahin hua he
 Narendra Jadhav said that if the GST rate is high, poor people will be killed
 sarvice sector main tex dar adhik hui to arthvyavastha ko nuksaan pahonchega
 Health, education and clothing can be quite expensive for a short time
 congress party kii taraf se bolte hue pi chidambaram ne sarkaar se apil kii he ki sarkaar bill main hi 18 fisadi ke standard tex rate ko jod de
 14 worldwide tax rate
 1 se lekar 16
 8 percent
 bharat main bhi adhiktam dar tay ho jaani chahie
 There will be no benefit if the tax of 24 to 26 percent is continued even after the introduction of GST
 chidambaram ne kaha ki jidipi kaa 57 fisadi sarvice sector se aata he
 If Service Tax 14
 5 se badhkar 24 pratishat hua to mahangaai bad jaaegi
 Therefore, 70 percent of goods and services should not be taxed more than 18 percent
 sipiem saansad seetaram yechuri ne jiesti ko lekar rajyon ke adhikaar main katautee ko rekhaankit kiya
 He said that the state should have the right to decide the tax
 yechuri ne cells tex par samvidhan sabha main doctor ambedkar ke kathan kaa zikr kiya
 He said, 'it seems to me that if we allow the provinces to impose sales tax, then the province should have the freedom to change the rates of sales tax according to their conditions
 isliye agar centre kii taraf se ceiling lagaai gai to cells tex ko lekar bahut dikkatein aaengi
 It is better that the provinces have the right to fix sales tax because the center has enough resources
 yechuri kaa kahana he ki ab rajyon ke paas cells tex kaa adhikaar nahin rahegaa
 How will the state increase its resources
 yechuri ne kaha ki jiesti apratyaksh kar he
 Due to this the poor are burdened
 jaise is bajet main vitt mantri ne kaha ki bharat main 37
 7 percent tax comes from direct tax
 jise aap inakam tex ke rup main jaanate hai

 If this happens, the economy will collapse

 If you want to read strict criticism, you can read Devendra Sharma's article published on 19 December 2015 daily on Catch News
 rajyasabha se paas hone ke baad raashtrapati ise sabhi rajyon kii vidhansabha ke paas bhejenge
 Out of which 15 legislatures have to be approved
 uske baad jiesti council banane kaa kaam shuru hoga
 a new bureaucratic structure for the GST Council will be created at the Center and the state
 masalan centre main principal chif kamishnar of central jiesti jaise pad honge to rajyon main state jiesti kamishnar hoga
 For this, training of officers has also started
 centre sarkaar ko do jiesti kanoon banane hai
 Central GST and Inter State g ST
 rajya sarkaron ko apane apane yahaan state jiesti kanoon paas karwaanaa hoga
 But before that the draft of these three laws will be discussed in the GST Council
 jiesti council main kisi mudde ko teen chauthai maton se hi paas karaayaa ja sakegaa
 Two-thirds of the voting rights have been given to the states
 ek tihaai matdaan kaa adhikaar centre ke paas rahegaa
 Without the broad consent of both, no proposal will be passed in the GST Council
 centre kaa rajyon par vito hoga or rajyon kaa centre par
 The Finance Minister has said that GST will be implemented as soon as the information technology is set up after these three laws are enacted and implemented
 unhone koi taarikh to nahin bataai magar kaha ki bahut der nahin hogi
 Many people say that there may be a new tax system coming into existence
 ek se teen saal kaa vakt lag jaae
 Because what will be the same rate now, the decision has to be made in the GST Council
 samaan tex rate ko lekar lagata nahin ki ek do baithkon main maamla tay ho jayega
 In a way, will the budget of states now be made in the GST Council
 gaiyr bhaajapa or gaiyr congress dalon ne rajyon ke adhikaar ko lekar sawaal uthaae hai
 BJD MP AU Singh Dev said why the Center should have veto power
 
 
 
 States should have more veto power
 basapa ke satish mishra ne kaha ki jiesti council main vaais chairman kaa pad hona chahie jo centre main sarkaar chalaa rahi party or vipakshi party se alag ho taaki santulan bana rahe
 Praful Patel of NCP said that Brihan Mumbai Municipal Corporation has more revenue than many states
 agar samay par paisa nahin mila to mumbai jaise shaharon kaa kaam ruk jayega
 Shiv Sena also said that efforts are being made to weaken Mumbai through GST, Mumbai never asked for money from the Center but now what will happen to Mumbai
 trinmul congress ke saansad derek o bryan ne jiesti ko girggit samjhauta tex kaha he
 His party has been a supporter of GST, but Derek o'brien said that the Congress and BJP have done politics for children
 ise turant lagu karnaa chahie
 Economist Narendra Jadhav said that GDP 1 from the implementation of GST
 5 pratishat se do pratishat tak bad jaaegi
 For governments, the scope of tax collection will increase and black money will decrease
 par narendra jadhav ne yah bhi kaha ki sirf jiesti se arthvyavastha kii sari buraaiyaan dur nahin ho jaaengi
 Wherever GST is not implemented properly there is no benefit
 narendra jadhav ne kaha ki agar jiesti rate adhik hua to garib logon par maar padegi
 If the tax rate is higher in the service sector, the economy will be harmed
 thode samay ke liye swasthya, shiksha or kapadaa kaaphi mahangaa ho saktaa he
 Speaking on behalf of the Congress party, P
 Chidambaram has appealed to the government to add a standard tax rate of 18 percent to the bill itself
 duniya bhar main tex rate 14
 1 to 16
 8 pratishat he
 The maximum rate should also be fixed in India
 agar jiesti aane ke baad bhi 24 se 26 pratishat kaa tex lagata rahe to koi laabh nahin hoga
 Chidambaram said that 57 per cent of GDP comes from the service sector
 agar sarvice tex 14
 If it increases from 5 to 24 percent then inflation will increase
 isliye 70 fisadi vastu or sevaaon par 18 fisadi se adhik tex nahin laganaa chahie
 CPM MP Sitaram Yechury underlined the cuts in states' authority over GST
 unhone kaha ki tex tay karne kaa adhikaar rajya kaa hona chahie
 Yechury referred to Dr
 Ambedkar's statement in the Constituent Assembly on sales tax
 unhone kaha, 'mujhe aisa lagata he ki agar ham praanton ko cells tex lagane dete hai tab praant ko azaadi honi chahie ki ve apni sthitiyon ke anusaar cells tex kii daron main badlaav kar saken
 Therefore, if the ceiling is imposed by the Center, then there will be a lot of problems regarding sales tax
 behatar he cells tex tay karne kaa adhikaar praanton ke paas rahe kyonki centre ke paas paryaapt sansaadhan hote hai
 Yechury says that states will no longer have the right to sales tax
 rajya apana sansaadhan kaise badhayega
 Yechury said that GST is an indirect tax
 iske kaaran garibon par boj padataa he
 Like the Finance Minister said that 37 in India
 7 pratishat kar pratyaksh kar se aata he
 What you know as income tax
 62
 3 percent comes from indirect tax, sales tax, VAT tax, etc
 indonesia jaise desh main pratyaksh kar kaa hissaa 55
 8 percent, 57 in South Africa
 5 pratishat he
 Yechury was arguing that at one time the GST rate in the House itself was stated to be 27 percent
 agar aisa hua to arthvyavastha charmara jaaegi
 So all these arguments were given
 ashanka or sambhaavna ko lekar baaten hui
 Changes in the tax system are now fixed
 kya hoga ham nahin jaanate hai
 GST was introduced in France only in 1954
 france kii jidipi 1
 16 percent
 140 deshon main jiesti he
 GDP of China 6
 81 pratishat he, japan kii jidipi 0
 Germany's GDP is 59 percent
 51 pratishat he, britain kii jidipi 2
 52 percent, comments america main jiesti nahin he
 GDP there 2
 57 pratishat he
 There is no GST in India at this time
 bharat kii jidipi 7
 26 percent
 saare bhaashan to nahin sune lekin jitne bhi vaktaaon ko suna unki baton main duniya bhar main jiesti ke kya anubhav rahe hai iskaa naam maatr kaa hi zikr rahaa
 As a citizen, we were deprived of knowing the experiences of those countries
 hamen nahin maaloom ki jin 140 deshon main jiesti lagu hui kya sabhi kii jidipi main oochaal aayaa
 What is the basis of the claim of a one and a half to two per cent jump after GST in India
 kya un deshon main kar chori kam ho gai, kaala dhan kam ho gaya
 There is no doubt that the Indian tax system needs basic reforms
 kya ab se chungi samaapt ho jaaegi
 No one will stop the trucks
 kar chori nahin hogi
 Millions of people work in small and medium scale industries
 un chote kaarkaanon ko kya vaisaa hi laabh hoga jo bade kaarkaanon ko hoga
 New system
 iske nae nae anubhav honge or sudhaar hota chalegaa
 Such a big change cannot be accomplished all at once, but we can talk about the virtues and the faults
 taaki ham sabaki is masale par samaj behatar ho
 If you want to read about its possibilities, then you can read the article of Sachin Bansal of Flipkart which was featured in Economic Times on 25 July
 jisamen wo daawa karte hai ki jiesti se i-kamrs main bhayankar oochaal aayega
 He says that the tax system will be better than GST, which will benefit every sector
 sakht aalochana padhani ho to aap 19 disambar 2015 ke rose kaich news par chape devendra sharma kaa lekh pard sakate hai
 In GST Council, any issue can be passed with three fourths of votes
 do tihaai matdaan kaa adhikaar rajyon ko diya gaya he
 One-third of the voting rights will remain with the center
 bina donon kii vyapak sahmati ke jiesti council main koi prastaav paas nahin ho sakegaa
 The Center will have a veto on the states and the states on the center
 vitt mantri ne kaha he ki in teenon kanoonon ke banane ke baad or ise lagu karne ke liye information technalji kaa dhaancha khadaa hote hi jiesti lagu kar di jaegiri
 He did not give any date but said that it will not be too late
 kai logon kaa kahana he ki nai kar pranali ke vajood main aane main ho saktaa he
 It takes one to three years
 kyonki abhi wo samaan dar kya hogi iskaa faisla jiesti council main hona he
 Regarding the same tax rate, it does not seem that the matter will be decided in one or two meetings
 ek tarah se rajyon kaa bajet kya ab jiesti council main banane lagegaa
 non-bjp and non-congress parties have raised questions about the right of states
 bijedy saansad e you singh dev ne kaha ki centre ke paas vito power kyon hona chahie
 
 
 
 rajyon ko zyada vito power hona chahie
 bsp's Satish Mishra said that the GST Council should have the post of Vice Chairman, which is different from the party running the government at the center and the opposition party so as to keep the balance
 ensipi ke prafull patel ne kaha ki brihan mumbai munisapal corporation kaa rajasav kai rajyon se zyada he
 If money is not received on time, then the work of cities like Mumbai will stop
 shivasena ne bhi kaha ki jiesti ke zariye mumbai ko kamazor karne kii koshish ho rahi he, mumbai ne kabhi centre se paisa nahin maanga lekin ab mumbai kaa kya hoga
 Trinamool Congress MP Derek o'brien called the GST a chameleon settlement tax
 unki party jiesti kii samarthak rahi he lekin derek o bryan kaa kahana tha ki ise lekar congress or bijepi ne bacchon si raajnneeti kii he
 It should be implemented immediately
 arthshaastri narendra jadhav ne kaha ki jiesti lagu hone se jidipi 1
 Will increase from 5 percent to two percent
 sarkaron ke liye tex vasuuli kaa dayera bad jayega or kaala dhan ghatega
 But Narendra Jadhav also said that only the GST will not remove all the evils of the economy
 jahaan bhi jiesti thik se lagu nahin hua he vahaan iskaa phayda nahin hua he
 Narendra Jadhav said that if the GST rate is high, poor people will be killed
 sarvice sector main tex dar adhik hui to arthvyavastha ko nuksaan pahonchega
 Health, education and clothing can be quite expensive for a short time
 congress party kii taraf se bolte hue pi chidambaram ne sarkaar se apil kii he ki sarkaar bill main hi 18 fisadi ke standard tex rate ko jod de
 14 worldwide tax rate
 1 se lekar 16
 8 percent
 bharat main bhi adhiktam dar tay ho jaani chahie
 There will be no benefit if the tax of 24 to 26 percent is continued even after the introduction of GST
 chidambaram ne kaha ki jidipi kaa 57 fisadi sarvice sector se aata he
 If Service Tax 14
 5 se badhkar 24 pratishat hua to mahangaai bad jaaegi
 Therefore, 70 percent of goods and services should not be taxed more than 18 percent
 sipiem saansad seetaram yechuri ne jiesti ko lekar rajyon ke adhikaar main katautee ko rekhaankit kiya
 He said that the state should have the right to decide the tax
 yechuri ne cells tex par samvidhan sabha main doctor ambedkar ke kathan kaa zikr kiya
 He said, 'it seems to me that if we allow the provinces to impose sales tax, then the province should have the freedom to change the rates of sales tax according to their conditions
 isliye agar centre kii taraf se ceiling lagaai gai to cells tex ko lekar bahut dikkatein aaengi
 It is better that the provinces have the right to fix sales tax because the center has enough resources
 yechuri kaa kahana he ki ab rajyon ke paas cells tex kaa adhikaar nahin rahegaa
 How will the state increase its resources
 yechuri ne kaha ki jiesti apratyaksh kar he
 Due to this the poor are burdened
 jaise is bajet main vitt mantri ne kaha ki bharat main 37
 7 percent tax comes from direct tax
 jise aap inakam tex ke rup main jaanate hai
 62
 3 pratishat apratyaksh kar se aata he, cells tex waite tex vagairah
 Direct tax share in a country like Indonesia 55

 yechuri tark kar rahe the ki ek samay sadan main hi jiesti kaa rate 27 fisadi bataaya gaya tha
 If this happens, the economy will collapse

 There were talks about apprehension and possibility

 07 disambar 2011: tasveeron main dekhen india today The Shiv Sena has targeted the BJP government at the Center over the vandalism of an innocent girl in Aligarh
 shivasena ne somvaar ko apane mukhpatr saamana main kaha ki vijay kaa utsav khatm ho gaya ho to aligarh main hue dardanaak cond kii taraf dekhnaa chahie
 The Shiv Sena said that a two-and-a-half-year-old girl was killed in Uttar Pradesh's Aligarh for just Rs 10,000
 puure desh main ise lekar aakrosh he, kuch logon ne mombatiyaan jalaakar aakrosh vyakt kiya to vahiin akshay kumaar, anupam kher, abhishek bachchan or sania mirza jaisi 'utsav' mandali ne is ghatana ke khilaaf apana aakrosh vyakt kiya he
 Akshay Kumar, expressing his feelings, said that i am scared and disappointed
 ye wo duniya nahin he, jo ham apane bacchon ke liye bananaa chaahate the
 Shiv Sena said in its mouthpiece that this is the sentiment of the entire country
 shivasena ne kaha ki congress ke shasankaal main ‘nirbhaya cond’ hua
 At that time, the people who did not allow Parliament to run and forced the government to implement stringent laws against the atrocities of women, those people are sitting in power today

 For the way the life of a two-and-a-half-year-old girl was ended, words like inhuman and atrocious should also be reduced
 shivasena ne kaha ki priyanka gandhi, rahul gandhi or akhilesh yadav ne bhi bacchee ke prati apni samvednaa vyakt kii he, lekin sattadhish ke rup main chunakar aae hai, aise janpratinidhiyon ko apni maryaada kaa paalan karnaa chahie
 Modi and Shah keep explaining such people again and again, yet why do these people go astray? BJP MP Sakshi Maharaj went to jail and met an accused of rape, he was uprooted in Uttar Pradesh

 ab sirf paanch siton ke parinaam ghoshit hone baaki hai
 In the 'first past the post' system, the candidate with the most votes on a seat is declared victorious
 sipien-yumail ke netaa vishnu rijaal ne kaha, 'chunaav ayog kii ore se prantiy vidhansabha or pratinidhi sabha main sabhi vijayi ummidavaaron ke parinaam aadhikarik taur par prakashit karne ke baad nepal main nai vam sarkaar disambar ke ant tak banegi

 ) Now the biggest bubble cryptocurrency after internet is proving bitcoin
 is vakt 1
 There are 67 million bitcoins in existence, worth more than $ 267 billion by the time these lines are written (one is worth $ 16,000)
 iske aakaar ko samajhane ke liye yah dekhie ki 1 disambar ko prachlan main maujuud rupayon kaa kul mulya takreeban 252 arab (65 ru
 Of 1 dollar)
 janvari 2017 main bitcoin kii kharid-farokht 1,000 dollar se kam par kii ja rahi thi or disambar ke pehle pakhwaade main yah 16,000 dollar par pahunch gaya
 This increase in price by 2,000 per cent led to a huge increase in its business
 ab kai hindustani isamen jute gaye hai or kai share bazaar bhi rupye main bitcoin kaa kaarobaar hone de rahe hai
 The price of bitcoin keeps on fluctuating: 20% change in a single session is common
 isaki tulana main sone kii keemat main puure saal takreeban 8 fisadi kaa badlaav aayaa
 This fluctuation makes it extremely risky
 aaj aap ek bitcoin main ek car kharid sakate hai, agle hafte ho saktaa he, do kaaren kharid len yaa phir mahaj ek dopahiyaa bhar
 So if you are dealing in bitcoin, it would be unwise to put your entire amount at stake in it
 isliye thodaa-thodaa khelen
 Bitcoin Unique Computer Code is fought for novices
 nae bitcoin ganit ke sawaalon ko hal karke banaae (nikaale) jate hai
 Each coin can be divided into 100 million unique pieces called 'satoshi'
 iskaa yah naam iske mashhoor avishkaarak satoshi naakamoto ke sakvamaan main rakhaa gaya he
 Bitcoins are created with clever cryptography
 isamen ek khule, baante gaye, electronic khate kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he, jise 'blockchen' kaha jaataa he jisamen samay kii mohar lage lenden ke 'block' hote hai
 After it is created, every transaction in bitcoin is continuously recorded in the blockchain
 blockchen kii prati koi bhi downlod kar saktaa he or coin ke lenden kaa itihaas dekh saktaa he
 Bitcoins are kept in a digital wallet
 harek wolet kii ek saarvajanik aaidi sankhya yaa saarvajanik chaabi hoti he
 Each wallet also has a private key that only its owner knows
 agar yah chaabi gum jaae to isamen rakhe coin gaayab ho jaaenge or unhen waapas hasil karne kaa koi tarika nahin he
 Transactions are done using this private key with that public account number so that the 'fixed coin' can be inserted into another wallet
 harek lenden ek khaas 'hesh' (encripted) messej yaa sandesh taiyaar karata he jiske saath chhedchhad nahin kii ja sakati
 Anyone can test this message by applying public key
 jab lenden kaa sandesh bhej diya jaataa he, to yujar aasaani se jaanch kar saktaa he ki (i) wolet main ve nishchit coin vaaki hai yaa nahin or (ii) ek hi coin se do lenden karke koi dhokhadhadi to nahin ho rahi he
 When most users test the authenticity of the transaction, the blockchain is updated by adding that transaction to a new 'block'
 ek lenden kii tasdik karne main 10 minute lagate hai
 Cryptocurrency exchanges make bitcoin transactions possible in many currencies
 ye exange us wolet kaa logon yaa sansthaaon se milan karte hue kevaisi kii maang karenge
 But transactions outside the exchange are easy
 ek nayaa wolet banaaen, isamen coin rakhen or nakadi ke liye nijee chaabi kii adla-badali karen
 Transacting bitcoins in multiple currencies anonymously is an easy way to send cross-border amounts
 keval japan, australia tathaa kuch or desh ise mudra ke taur par manyata dete hai
 Most other countries are yet to define it

 CRPF personnel are falling prey to the deadliest improvised explosive devices (ieds) or landmines of the Maoists
 maovadiyon ne iidi jameen ke neeche gaad rakhi hai, ped par lataka rakhi hai yaa postaron-parchon ke peeche bhi chipka rakhi hoti hai, taaki javaanon or unki bakhtarband gadipoon ko nishaanaa bana saken
 These explosives can be used as they are, so they have become the easiest and deadliest weapon of destruction

 Meanwhile, the force also recovered about 57 tonnes of explosives

 In the absence of MPV, CRPF has to use non-armored private trucks for patrolling

 Meanwhile, the other major problem of the small fleet of mpvs is that in case of any disturbance, the mistry has to be specially called or some jawans have to be sent to the company to get the parts

 '' yah sankhya to siarpief kii jarurat ke hisaab se kaaphi kam he

 lagata he, maovadiyon ko isaki jaankaree 2005 main hi lag gai thi (jaisaa jabt sahitya se pataa chalata he)
 Since then, Maoists have used TNT up to 50 kg to target MPV and sometimes up to 80 kg to blast

 All this is happening through Twitter and Facebook

 In these letters, there are many questions about the functioning of the Aam Aadmi Party
 sawaalon ke centre main aap ke sansthaapakon main se do shakhsiyaten hai- yogendra yadav or prashanth bhushan
 Not only this, Admiral Ramdas, aap's internal ombudsman, has questioned Kejriwal's continuance as party convenor even after he became the chief minister
 yahi party kaa sabase bada pad he
 In the midst of these questions, AAP leader Sanjay Singh asks in his tweet, "those who want to remove Arvind Kejriwal from the post of convener, do they care about the sentiments of the workers of the country?" The rise and hearing of questions is a sign of good democracy 
 yogendra yadav ko piesi yani party kii raajnneetik maamalon kii samiti se hataane kii muhim chal rahi he
 Prashant Bhushan has threatened to resign, as there is no Swaraj in the party and the party is becoming person-centered
 yahaan aashay kejariwal kendrit hone se he
 However, Swaraj is Kejriwal's dream project
 isi naam se unhone ek kitaab bhi likhi he
 Amid the chaos in AAP, Yogendra Yadav writes on his Facebook page, "I have been listening, reading and reading news of Prashant ji and me for the last two days
 nai nai kahaniyaan gadhi ja rahi hai, aarope madhe ja rahe hai, shadyantr khoje ja rahe hai
 Reading all this brings laughter and sorrow

 It seems that the story makers will have less time and more imagination

 Along with the Facebook post, Yogendra Yadav has also sent a tweet filled with advice
 yadav kehete hai, "'yah vaqt badi jeet ke baad bade man se, bade kaam karne kaa he
 The country has raised great expectations from us
 choti harkaton se khud ko or is aashaa ko chota na karen
 "after the election results, Arvind Kejriwal advised the activists to avoid arrogance
 yadav shaayad unhen wo baat yaad dilaanaa chaahate hai
 The real reason for the confrontation is one of the reasons for the party's activities
 kejariwal chaahate hai ki philhal dilli par hi focus rakhaa jaae
 While the other section, which also includes Yogendra Yadav, wants to expand the party across the country
 kejariwal kaa tark he ki desh ke baaki hisson main dilli kii tarah grassroot level par kaaryakarta taiyaar nahin he
 Defeats in the Lok Sabha and Haryana assembly elections and a landslide victory in Delhi also support Kejriwal's argument
 khabar ye bhi he ki khud kejariwal ne sanyojak kii jimmedaari se mukti kii ichha jataai he taaki wo dilli par puraa dhyaan de saken
 Anyway, except the Chief Minister's post, Kejriwal has already given the entire ministry to Deputy CM Manish Sisodia
 tasviir kaa doosraa pahalu bhi dhundhala nahin he
 a section of the party is trying to explain that after Kejriwal became the Chief Minister, he did not keep any department with him so that he could run the party on his own

 ) Hello, Ravish Kumar
 raajnneeti main kuch aisa ho rahaa he jis par aap darshakon ko apane−apane dalon kii nishtha se upar uth kar nazar rakhane kii zarurat he
 It is possible that in this match some team is winning from some point in your eyes, but overall we are all losing
 agar ye baat thik na lage to congress bijepi ke paale main apni kursi khinch kar baith jaaiye or prime time dekhiye
 But first look at this picture which has appeared in today's Hindustan Times
 tasviranusaar venkaiya naidu se congress ke netaa sahaj rup se ekant main vaartalap kar rahe hai
 It is known from this that our leaders also talk to each other in private spaces i
e
 drawing room type
 is tasviir ko dekhakar lagegaa ki ek aap or aap hai jo in donon dalon ke takaraar ko gambhirtha se lene lagate hai
 Look at these pictures and ask yourself if these leaders cannot demonstrate such relationships in the public space
 charchaa kaa sandarbh aap jaanate hi hai ki haryana ke kaithal main pradhanmantri ke kaarykram main jab mukhyamantri bhupendra singh hooda ne bhaashan diya to unki hooting ho gai
 Hooting is the English word, you can understand it by hule lele or sloganeering
 mukhyamantri ne apana bhaashan bich main hi samaapt kar diya
 According to newspaper reports, the Prime Minister also appealed to the crowd to calm down
 baad main mukhyamantri ne kaha ki unka apmaan hua he or ab ve pradhanmantri ke kisi bhi kaarykram main nahin jaaenge
 Now even if you said so, should the Prime Minister not have expressed his regret publicly or personally on receiving this information
 duusari taraf kya yah baat itani badi thi ki hooda sahab ko aisa elaan karnaa chahie tha
 The Congress should have appealed to the opposition chief ministers, including himself, to boycott the Prime Minister's program
 maharashtra ke mukhyamantri prithviraj chavaan ne bhi elaan kar diya or aaj jab pradhanmantri maharashtra pahunche to ve nahin gaye
 But today a positive thing happened
 nagpur main kendriya mantri venkaiya naidu ne kaha ki unhone maharashtra ke mukhyamantri se baat kii
 He told that this program is shared by the Center and Maharashtra
 aana chahie
 Vekaiah said that he is missing
 pradhanmantri sanghavaad main yakeen rakhte hai
 Prime Minister went to Jharkhand before Maharashtra
 vahaan par rajya ke mukhyamantri hemanth sorain ne bhi logon se apil kii ki shant rahen or unhen bhaashan puraa karne den, lekin unke khilaaf bhi narebaazi hone lagi or bheed modi modi karne lagi
 But here the Prime Minister silenced the slogans and recorded them in pictures
 yah ek acha kadam tha
 But even then people did not agree
 sanvaidhanik vyavastha main pradhanmantri kaa darja bada he
 Shouldn't he, as a elder, call the Chief Ministers and end this dispute
 pradhanmantri to khud hi siem or piem kii team banane kii baat ek saal se kar rahe hai
 Shouldn't he, as the current and future head of this team, take the initiative and end the controversy
 congress ne aarope lagaaya ki yah rajyon ke saath apmaan he
 But, is the Congress not insulting the Prime Minister? kya use is had tak jane se pehle yah nahin sochna chahie tha ki desh ke pradhanmantri hai
 There may be another way of protest
 aakhir is ladaai kaa ant kahaan jaakar hoga
 How can one resist going to or speaking in front of someone while taking the vows of democracy? kendriya urja mantri piyush goyal ne kaha ki ve logon ko narebaazi karne se nahin roak sakate hai
 Modi ji is so popular and what can he do if there is a wave across the country in favor of BJP
 kya ek kendriya mantri kaa yah jawaab paryaapt tha
 Should Goyal not learn from Venkaiah Naidu? kya sari raajnneeti isi buniyaad par hogi ki pehle congress ne kiya to ham bhi karenge
 What generosity did the Congress show on its behalf
 ambika soni ne kaha ki ham is tarah kii beijwati bardaasht nahin karenge
 We can also raise five hundred people to raise slogans when the PM is speaking

 The relationship goes on simply because at one time you were tied to the door of the two promises or even today you continue to be each other's social needs

 unhen ye ahsaas karaaen ki aapke liye ve or unke liye aap unte hi khaas hai, jitne ki pehle hua karte the
 Take away their problems
 If your partner is upset about anything, even if one of your dear friends is married, then make him realize that he would never be able to feel the lack of friends
 uske liye ek sarprise party kaa intjaam karen, thik waisi hi, jaisi ve apane doston ke saath manaaya karte the or phir dekhen ki kaise unki ankhon main chamak ke saath hi baras padataa he pyaar

 bhale hi ghar main unka pansadeeda khaanaa banaakar yaa phir ek mjedaar party dekar, jisamen mahaj aap donon hi hon

 rajasthan ke mukhyamantri ashok gahalot 20 se 24 janvari ke bich jaipur sahitya sammelan main salmaan rushdi ko na keval aane se rokane balki unki video conferencing bhi rukvane main kaamyaab rahe
 On 18 January, he met Union Home Minister P
K
 chidambaram se mili
 After that, the central agencies were asked for all their possible help so that writer Rushdie could not even broadcast directly or virtual
 sidhaa prasaaran rokane se ain pehle 24 janvari ko muslim forum ke netaa pakir faruki media se bole, ''jaipur police ayukta bi
 L
 soni ke mutabik, agar video conferencing hui to yah jaipur main aakhri sahitya samaaroh hoga
 He has told this to the organizers
 ''police ne aayojakon yaa rushdi kii suraksha ke bare main kabhi aashwaasan nahin diya or vah khatre kii ek badi ashanka lagaataar jataati rahi
 Rushdie is no older than the ceremony
 agar kuch gadabadi hui, jisaki kaaphi zyada sambhaavna he, to phir ham katai jimmedaar nahin honge
 "why did Gehlot want to stop Rushdie? Gehlot wanted the Congress high command to use this opportunity to prove himself as the caretaker of Muslim interests
" sitambar main uttar pradesh kii seemaa se sate gopalgarh (alvar) kasbe main rajasthan police kii goliyon se 10 mev musalamaanon ke maare jane ke baad se party khud ko behad danvadol haalat main paa rahi thi
 More than half a dozen communal incidents took place in the state with Muslims being the target
 ajmer shahar main quran sharif ke panne jalaae gaye
 The state intelligence agency had told Gehlot that posters have been seen in areas adjacent to Uttar Pradesh in which he has been compared to Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi's Godhra, describing him as 'ashok Modi of Gopalgarh'
 unhone faisla kiya ki sammelan ke liye rushdi ko bheje nyaute kaa istemaal apni kharaab chhavi thik karne ke liye kiya jaae, bhale hi iske liye mutthi bhar musalamaanon ko sammelan main aane vaale hajaaron logon ke liye hinsak khatra bataanaa pade
 Gehlot's strategy: Gahlot took cognizance of the memorandum of an unknown and unheard faction
 is samooh ne khud ko muslim ekta forum bataaya or apane gyaapan ke saath devband ke daarul ulum kaa patr bhi natthi kiya
 Darul Uloom demanded the Center to keep Rushdie away from the event but he ignored it in 2007 when he attended
 party aalaa kaman se ijaajat liye bagaiyr bhaajapa ke rajya alpsankhyak cell ne bhi rushdi ko samaaroh se dur rakhane kii maang kii
 The existence of this BJP cell is almost the same as that of the Unity Forum
 gahalot ne in mutthi bhar musalamaanon ko harakat main laa diya jabaki inamen se kisi kaa kuch bhi daanv par nahin tha
 Before the commencement of the conference, he repeatedly said that in view of such sentiment, a big problem of law and order can arise
 rajasthan vishvavidhyalay se jude mushirul hasan ne kaha ki puure jaipur main virodh karne vaale 50-100 se zyada nahin the
 "who instigated them?" We need to know? ”gehlot realized that this would upset the liberals and his open support of the travel ban would damage his image
 lihaaja, unhone bhram paidaa karne kaa rasta chunaa
 On one hand, he claimed that he was telling the Center the views of opposing people
 saath hi ve yah bhi kehete rahe ki ve or unki sarkaar is yatra main katai baadhak nahin hai
 The lie was apprehended by Rushdie's statement about his and his government's conspiracy to visit Gairushdi
 20 janvari ko rushdi ne kaha ki ve apni yatra radd karne ko majaboor hue jab unhen aisi khufia jaankaree mili ki unki hatya ke liye bhaade ke do hatyare mumbai se ravaanaa ho gaye hai
 The Intelligence Bureau pulled out a June 2011 notification and created and released it anew
 isamen kaha gaya tha ki maharashtra main hathiyaaron ke saath hiraasat main liye gaye ek aadmi par shaq he ki vah rushdi ko apana nishaanaa bana saktaa he
 But once Soni and the Maharashtra Police denied any such danger or the possibility of untoward, Rushdie and the media called the threat a lie
 iske baad gahalot or unke grih sachiv ji
 s
 sandhu 23 janvari ko yah sweekaar karne ko majaboor hue ki ve aadhikarik taur par yatra ke bare main jaanate the or aayojakon or rushdi ko khatre ke bare main aagaah karte rahe hai
 After all, a very senior police officer involved in the plan to keep Man Liyarushdi away told India Today, "yes, we were successful in implementing the order to keep Rushdie away
 '' rajya congress pravaktaa satyendra raghav ne 24 janvari ko pehali baar party kaa aadhikarik rukh bataaya, ''ham is baat ke liye taiyaar the ki angreji media hamaari aalochana karegaa
 Yes, Congress never wanted Rushdie to come
 ''police karrwai puri tarah pradarshnakariyon kii sahaayta karne par kendrit thi
 This attitude of the state police was in sharp contrast to the fact that it provided complete security to Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi during his two visits to Jaipur on 9 and 17 January
 modi ko jaan kaa jokhim rushdi se kahin zyada he
 Or when he made security arrangements for the American talk show celebrity Oprah Winfrey on January 22, while there was no terrorist threat to her
 unka satr shuru hone ke ek ghante se bhi pehle us sthal ke daravaaje band kar die gaye
 2,000 pasadhari were stopped 200 meters from the venue
 andar jagah hone ke baavjood logon ko do ghante tak bheetar nahin jane diya gaya
 In contrast, the police told the organizers that the four authors reading excerpts from the banned book Satanic Verses leave Jaipur to avoid arrest or being a victim of violence even though these authors had not broken the law as they did not have the banned book
 police ne aayojakon se kaha ki ve pradarshnakariyon ko aagatuk ke rup main darj karen
 Some of them also prayed at the festival site
 iske saath hi, police ne aayojakon se kaha ki ve video conferencing kar sakate hai lekin yah sunishchit karen ki bahes ke dauraan kisi tarah bhi kanoon kaa ulanghan na ho
 This was a strategy to prevent the organizers from entering the protesters
 lekin rushdi kii prastaavit video conferencing shuru hone se ek ghanta pehle hi police ne puure kshetra ko sil kar diya
 He even stopped buses full of school students wanting to come to the venue a km in advance
 aayojak video conferencing shuru karte, iske kuch hi minute pehle police ne apane bina hathiyaar vaale javaanon se aage kaa lon gher lene ko kaha, jisase aayojakon ko khatre kii gambhirtha kaa ehsaas ho or ve apana iraadaa chhod den
 Frustrated, he canceled the video conferencing
 aatmasamarpanais sammelan ke jariye mashhoor hue diggi pales ke maalik ram pratap singh ne bhi sarkaar kaa hi raag alaapna pasand kiya
 He announced that he had denied permission for video conferencing
 aayojakon kii mukhya aawaaj sanjay roy ko kaarykram radd karne kaa bayaan bich main hi adhuraa chhodana padaa kyonki unhen haashie par kar diya gaya tha
 Gehlot's success will be redeemed in the Uttar Pradesh election as someone who did not allow Rushdie to enter his state
 gahalot aakhirkaar sabhi musalamaanon ko khatarnaak tareeke se hinsak ho jane kii baat prachaarit karne main safal ho gaye
 It remains to be seen whether the Gehlot administration's arrow to propagate Muslims as a violent community costs the Congress in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections or will BJP get Hindu votes! germany kii chancelar angela mercel ne isroyal ke pradhanmantri benjamin netanyahu ke saath baithak ke baad kaha ki agar tehran isroyal ko ek desh ke rup main manyata detaa he to germany iran ke saath sambandhon ko puri tarah saamaanya kar legaa

 In this episode, 'AAP' MLA Maninder Singh Dheer has been attached to the new name Jangpura
 dheer ne aam aadmi party ke andar loktantr kii kami ko mudri banaaya he or apni hi party kii kadi aalochana kii he
 Along with this, he has praised the actions of PM Modi and expressed his desire to join BJP
 dheer ne somvaar ko aam aadmi party par peeth ke pide raajnneeti karne kaa aarope lagaate hue kaha, 'party kii chhavi kharaab hui he
 i do not see democracy in the party
 jahaan kaam nahin hua vahaan party ko adhikaar he
 But i did a lot of work, yet politics took place behind my back
 aam aadmi party ke kaaryakarta galat tareeke se kaam kar rahe the
 i had also complained to Kejriwal
 'dheer ne kaha ki unhone aam aadmi party se tikat kii maang nahin kii he isliye tikat kaate jane kaa sawaal hi nahin uthta he
 Maninder Singh Dhir praised the Prime Minister and said, 'we have prepared toilets for the poor
 iske liye narendra modi bhi kehete hai

 'duusari ore, aam aadmi party ke sanyojak arvind kejariwal ne dheer kii baghawat par kaha ki jin logon ko tikat nahin miltaa he, vah isi tarah kaa bayaan dete hai
 However, Kejriwal also said that the party has not yet taken any decision on ticket distribution
 dheer ne kisi party kaa naam liye bina kaha ki jo bhi party unhen bulaaegi vah kaaryakarta ke taur par uske liye kaam karne ko taiyaar hai, lekin jis tarah unhone bijepi or modi ke liye sakaaratmak rukh apanaaya he
 Obviously his train wants to stop at the BJP station itself

 ji haa, abhi tak to aisa hi kaha jaataa rahaa he ki mummy-papa ke liye saare bachche ek samaan hote hai par ek adhyayan ke mutabik, mata-pita bhi bacchon ke bich bhedbhaav karte hai
 You may be sad to hear this, but this is a bitter truth
 is adhyayan ke tahat bacchon ke prati mata-pita ke vyavhaar kaa adhyayan kiya gaya
 The results of which were truly shocking
 adhyayan main paaya gaya kimata-pita kaa vyavhaar or pyaar bachche kii paidaaish par nirbharakarta he
 For example, if he is their first child, then surely he will get some more love
 iskaa sidhaa sa matlab ye he ki agar aapkaa bhi koi bada bhai yaa koi badi bahan he to use aapaki tulana main kuch zyada pyaar milegaa

 Senior Congress leader and well-known actor Shatrughan Sinha said in a special conversation with NDTV that LK Advani ji was in tears when he came to know about his decision to quit BJP

 LK Advani is one of the founding members of the BJP

 According to sources, LK Advani was deeply saddened by the party's decision
 adwani ji se jude ek sutara ne bataaya ki is faisle se pehle bijepi ke kisi bhi bade netaa ne unase sampark tak nahin kiya
 Shatrughan Sinha said that i will never bow down to him, so that if he asks to sit, then if i ask to stand, i will stand up
 enditivi ne jab unase poocha ki kya balakot hamalaa is baar chunaav main koi asar chhodane vaala he to shatrughna sinha ne kaha ki aaj har hindustani desh bhakt he
 Today whenever you want to talk to PM Modi on an issue like unemployment, he will sit to remind you of Pulwama

 Mahatma Gandhi may not have been welcomed in Britain at the time of India's independence movement, but now he has a statue in Parliament Square in London, the capital of this country
 yah pratimaa britain ke purv pradhanmantri winston churchill ke thik bagal main lagaai he, jinhone unhen kabhi 'andhananga fakir' kii sangya di thi
 This nine feet tall bronze statue of Mahatma Gandhi was unveiled by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley

 Apart from these, Bollywood superstar Amitabh Bachchan and Gandhi's grandson Gopal Krishna Gandhi were also present in London on this occasion
 amitabh bachchan ne is maukey par mahatma gandhi kii kuch aitihaasik panktiyaan bhi padhin
 The installation of the Mahatma Gandhi statue was announced last year
 gandhi pehle bhartiya or kabhi bhi kisi pad par naa rahe aise pehle vyakti hai jinaki murti yahaan lagaayi gayi he
 On this occasion, Cameron said, 'this statue is a magnificent tribute to one of the greatest personalities of world politics and by placing a statue of Mahatma Gandhi on this famous square, we are giving him an eternal place in our country
 ’ gandhi ke kuch prasiddh shabdon kaa ullekh karte hue camran ne kaha ki gandhi kii shikshaayen aaj bhi praasangik hai
 He said, 'this statue symbolizes the amazing special friendship between the world's oldest and largest democracy as well as the global strength of Gandhi's messages
 ’ The British Prime Minister said, 'our relations with India have always remained close and they continue to grow with mutual respect, cooperation and trade with equality and undoubtedly through the 1
5 million Indians living in the UK who served in that UK Has contributed greatly to the construction that it is today, and has brought the two countries closer to their benefit
 ’ Jaitley, who was specially invited to the UK for the unveiling of the statue, said it symbolized the spirit of British courtesy that he had now honored a man who was traditionally considered his antagonist
 jetali ne kaha, ‘yah britain kii udaartaa or british loktantr kaa ek mahaan yogadan he ki unhone ab gandhi ko is desh ke sabase mahatvapurn saarvajanik sthal par jagah di he
 It is a great day when two opposing and opposite viewpoints are meeting to appreciate each other
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘yah pratimaa yah sunishchit karne main madad karegi ki aane vaali pidiyon ke liye gandhi kii viraasat jinda rahe
 It is an important, historic moment celebrating the strong ties between the two countries
 bharat or britain ek jaise mulya saajha karte hai or hamaare bich ek barabari kii bhagidaari he
 This lasting friendship is one of the many legacies left by Gandhi which i am keen that we work hard to make it stronger
