 At night you dream that you have to build a temple and in the morning you get ready to build a temple in the middle of the road
 yah shaayad sunne main thodaa ajeeb lag saktaa he lekin pichley dinon jharkhand ke ramgarh main kuch aisa hi najaara dekhne ko mila
 This has not only put the speedbreaker of religion in the middle of the road which is considered to be the basis of development, but communal harmony has also been endangered
 dharm kii raksha karne vaale log kuch sunne ko taiyaar nahin hai or prashasan se takaraav kii sthiti ban gai he
 The incident is very interesting
 ramgarh ke log bataate hai ki yahaan ek sthaneey mahila bhakt he, jo puja-paath karaane kaa kaam karti he
 He had been dreaming for almost a week that if the Kali temple is not established soon on the National Highway-33 being constructed in Kankabar, people may face a mountain of troubles
 neshnal hive banane kii vajah se vahaan maujuud dakshineshwar kaali mandir ko hataa diya gaya tha
 When he told the locals about his dream, on January 19, a huge crowd gathered and started building a temple in the middle of the road
 logon ne mandir ke liye aath foot kii diwaar khadi kar di
 When the administrative staff arrived to stop the construction work, the crowd got entangled with it and the police kept on watching
 lekin baat sirf yaheen khatm nahin hui
 The background of the case was prepared three years ago, when a survey was being carried out by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) from the outer edge of Ramgarh city to map the highway
 jharkhand vikaas morcha (jeviem) ke purv jiladhyaksh damodar mahato kehete hai, ''jab 10 july, 2012 ko dakshineshwar kaali mandir ko hataakar maaya tungari par sthapit kiya ja rahaa tha, tab tatkaaleen esadio deepak kumaar or dspi dhananjay kumaar ne hafte bhar main vahaan sthit masjid ko bhi hataane kii baat kahi thi
 But the temple was removed and the mosque has been secured
 yah graminon ke saath dhokhaa he
 NH-33 is about 352 km long
 ramgarh shahar ke baahar kankebaar main ban rahe four-len ke vivaad kii taaja shuruyaat 16 janvari ko nae map par hui
 NHAI officials reached the site with the new map, who told the people that the Noori mosque there had been saved
 is soochna ke baad mandir samarthakon ke bich teji se sandesh gaya ki unke saath dhokhaa hua he
 According to the old map, Dakshineswar Kali temple was removed while a new map has been made to save the mosque
 lihaaja, agle hi din prashasan ke khilaaf maahaul ban gaya
 On 19 January, a meeting was held at the SDO office to interact with the villagers
 usee dauraan esadio daftar se kareeb do darjan mahila-purushon ke khilaaf dhara 107 kaa notice jari kar diya gaya
 This action provoked the anger of the villagers
 baithak main shaamil logon ko isaki soochna milte hi baatcheet naakaam ho gai
 People started building the temple in the presence of police and administrative officials in a fit of rage and by the evening erected a wall eight feet high
 varanasi se dahnineshwar kaali kii pratimaa mangai gai or use sthapit kar puja paath shuru ho gaya
 If there is a matter of religion and dispute also exists, then those who bake political loaves also come
 yahaan vishwa hindu parishad (viechpi) ke antarrashtriya mahasachiv praveen togidsa pahunch gaye or saikadon viechpi kaaryakartaaon ke saath motorcycle juluus bhi nikaala
 He said, "first there was a temple here and later the road was built
 isliye mandir yaheen banegaa
 "the next day, Hazaribagh MP and BJP leader Yashwant Sinha also reached there and put the administration in the dock," being an MP i used to be in touch with the NHAI
 us samay tay hua tha ki mandir or masjid, donon hataae jaaenge
 At a meeting in the DC office on December 3 last year, it was said that the mosque would be lifted by December 30
 phir achaanak yah badlaav kaise ho gaya? '' unhone mandir nirmaan ke liye 25,000 ru
 Gave it too
 unhone kaha, ''bijepi tushtikaran kii raajnneeti nahin karti
 Secularism does not mean minority appeasement
 vah aisi raajnneeti kaa virodh karegi
 "on the other hand, Damodar Mahato says," When it was possible to save the mosque, why was the initiative not taken to save the temple, while the villagers also requested the administration to save the temple
 tab tatkaaleen upayukta amitabh kaushal ne kaha tha ki enechaeai ke map main badlaav sambhav nahin he
 Therefore, apart from the temple, the primary school and about one and a half dozen Karwali tribal families were also evicted
 ''ubaal yaheen tak simit nahin he
 All Jharkhand Students Union (AJSU) district secretary Manoj Mahato also questions the role of district administration and government
 manoj kehete hai, ''hamaara virodh masjid se nahin he or na hi ham vikaas virdohi hai
 The reason for the protest is the treacherous attitude of the government and administrative officials, who instead of taking transparent steps, took the initiative towards the new map and sowed the seeds of controversy
 nae map main masjid ke praaroop ko saundaryikaran kaa model bana diya gaya jabaki puraane map ke anusaar kaali mandir or skool hataa die gaye
 "congress leader Shehzada Anwar of Ramgarh also blames the government, administration and NHAI officials," The short-sighted move of the administration has created hatred in two communities
 prashasan har morche par vifal rahaa he
 The role of the government and the opposition on this issue is also insensitive, leading to confusion
 ''haalanki ramgarh ke upayukta dow
 Sunil Kumar Singh rejects any assurances such as the removal of the mosque within a week
 unhone kaha ki jise mandir kii jameen bataaya ja rahaa he, vah nijee parisar (dow
 Lalita's residential complex)
 iske liye unhen muaavja bhi de diya gaya he
 Not only this, the Deputy Commissioner dismissed any of his administrative negligence and irresponsibility
 unhone kaha, ''mandir nirmaan ke dauraan main chuttee par baahar tha
 i was not aware of this incident
 '' vahiin is maamle ke baad jila prashasan ne sthaneey bijepi netaa dhananjay kumaar kaa shastr license radd kar diya
 There was no response from the state government
 viechpi ke dakshin bihar kshetra ke sanghathan mantri rajendra kehete hai, ''desh ke sabhi nagarikon ke liye ek samaan kanoon he
 But due to the negative attitude of the Center, discriminatory policy is being adopted
 '' haalanki murram kala panchayat kii mukhiya archana mahato kahati hai, ''pichley teen saal main teen tarah ke map kii baat saamne ai
 Such conditions would not have arisen if land was made available for NH within a radius of 300 meters from the existing site
 ''logon kaa kahana he ki masjid hataae jane kii sambhaavna par muslim samudaay ne etraj jataate hue jila prashasan se map main badlaav kaa anurodh kiya tha
 In December, the administration requested NHAI for this, based on which a new map was prepared
 lekin koi bhi adhikari is baat kii pushti nahin kar rahaa he

 november 2016 main film padmavati (ab padmavat) kii shooting shuru hui thi, tabase lekar abhi tak yah film itihaas ko lekar vivaadon main he
 The film is releasing on 25 January despite continued protests

 The story of the film begins from the thirteenth century when the ruler of the Khilji dynasty, Jalaluddin Khilji (raza Murad), with his troops in Afghanistan, plans to conquer Delhi
 usee samay uskaa bhatija allaudin khilji (ranvir singh) aata he or chachaa kii beti mehrunisa (aditi raav hydari) ke saath nikaah kar letaa he
 Alauddin becomes the king of Delhi by killing his uncle after a few incidents
 vahiin duusari taraf mewar ke raja maharaval ratan singh (shahid kapur) jab singhl desh jate hai to vahaan unki mulaakaat rajkumaari padmini (deepika padukon) se hoti he
 After falling in love, Maharawal marries Padmini and brings her to Chittor

 Alauddin, impressed by the priest's words, sets out to attack Chittor
 chittod jaakar wo maharaval ke saath chal karke unhen bandi banaakar dilli le aata he or maharaja ko chhodane ke evaj main ek baar maharani padmavati ko dekhne kii baat kahata he
 After this, there are many twists in the story and ultimately the victory is the valor and valor of the Rajputs
 padmavat: 'khilji' kii khubasurat patni he aditi, videshon main bhi relies ko lekar krejakyon dekhne jaaen film padmavat- film sanjay lila bhansaali kii film main vijual treet hi unki kii filmameking kii style he
 Whether it is a sequence of war, a scene between a Maharaja and a queen or a scene of Jauhar, in every frame you get a special touch of Sanjay Leela Bhansali
 - film kaa art work kamaal kaa he or jo bhi drishy aapaki ankhon ke saamne aate hai wo ankhon ko sukhad anubhav dete hai 
 - The script of the film is described as fictional and the end of the story is already known by all
 lekin kahani ko sanjay lila bhansaali ne kaaphi dilachasp tareeke se pesh kiya he
 - There is no dream sequence or any kind of scene between Alauddin Khilji and Maharani Padmini in the film
 film main rajput samaaj or uske parakram ko hi screen par dikhaane kaa prayaas kiya gaya he, vahiin us samay kii mahilaon ke atmasamman kii dastaan ko bhi bayaan kiya gaya he
 If we talk about the characters in the film, then Deepika Padukone's performance is tremendous
 rani padmini ke kirdaar main deepika kaa kaam saraahneey he
 At the same time, Shahid Kapoor has played the role of a responsible husband and king in the role of Maharaja Rawal Ratan Singh
 allaudin khilji jaise krur vyaktitv ke insaan ko parde par nibhaa paane main ranvir singh ne koi kasar nahin chodi he
 Ranveer has worked on his character in a very amazing and wonderful way and he is also seen in the film
 iske alaava raja muraad, aditi raav hydari, gym sarbh, aayam or baaki sabhi kirdaaron ne sahaj abhinay kiya he
 - The music of the film is fine
 ghumar, ek dil ek jaan or baaki geet film ke screenple main sahaayta karte hai
 The background score and the wartime sound make the film even richer
 kamjor kadiyanpahali baar sanjay lila bhansaali kii film 3di main darshane kii koshish kii gai he, jisaki quality or behatar kii ja sakati thi saath hi film kaaphi lambii he
 Especially if the part before the interval was edited well, it could be quite crisp

 "it is a mockery of broken language and an anonymous letter written in bold letters
 bhashaa, vyakaran or vartanee ke lihaaj se yah behad saamaanya he, lekin isamen baaten aakraamak andaaj main likhi gai hai
 This letter led to the arrest of Raghav Ranjan, a bank worker working in Madayi, a small town located 25 km north of Kannur
 is giraftaar ke saath hi bhagode kii tarah jivan bitaa rahe raghav kii sansanikhej kahani saamne ai
 The main character of this story of forgery and cheating was Bitti Mohanty, the dgp's son who carried out the rape and escaped from police custody
 2006 main rajasthan ke alvar jile main 26 varshiya german tourist kaa balaatkaar karne ke jurm main bitti ko saat saal kii jail kii sajaa sunai gai thi
 He received parole in December of the same year and escaped
 faraar hone ke baad vah lambey samay tak laapata rahaa or is dauraan usne apana nayaa jivan pehle teacher, phir emb chaatr or ant main bankkarmi ke rup main bitaana shuru kar diya
 During this time, he prepared a concoction about his past life with the help of fake papers and lies while living in Puttaparthi in Andhra Pradesh and Kannur near Kerala
 state bank of travnakor (esabiti) main kaam karne vaale uske 20 kareebi sahyogiyon ko uski sharafat par bharosa tha or ve use sahi aadmi maanate the
 Despite not living together, he was disciplined and behaved most courteously
 lekin uskaa rukh bahut zyada dostana nahin tha
 The teacher from the Chinmaya Institute of Technology in Kannur, by the name of Raghav Ranjan, considered him an ideal and disciplined student with a special interest in spiritual subjects
 puttaparthi main uske mentor bhi use tej buddhi or naukari kii talash main shiddat se lage yuva kii tarah dekhte the
 The challenge of collecting evidence came from Rajasthan Police team with constable Hemendra Sharma who arrived in Kannur to take her into custody
 hemendra sharma un pulicekarmiyon main se the jinhone 2006 main bitti ko giraftaar kiya tha
 Kannur Superintendent of Police (SP) Rahul N
 nair kii ore se aath ghante lambii chali poochtacha ke baad raghav kii kahani main asthirataa najar aane lagi or yah lagane laga ki raghav vastav main bitti mohanti he
 Despite this, it could not be said clearly until any scientific technology like finger printing, DNA testing or lie detector was confirmed
 iske baad raghav ko rajasthan le jaaya gaya, jahaan se vah disambar 2006 main apni biimaar maa ko katak jaakar dekhne ke liye mili 15 din ke parole ke dauraan gaayab ho gaya tha
 The interrogating policemen said that Raghav initially denied that he was Bitti
 usne orissa main lee gai apni shiksha, andhra pradesh main bitaye gaye apane jivan or apane mata-pita kii shaadi tuutane kii kahani vistaar se bataani shuru kar di
 But as soon as the police showed him the pictures and video clips of the accused in the Alwar rape case, he started breaking up
 rajasthan police maanati he ki uski pahchaan ko tay karne kaa sabase acha tarika uske diene kaa uske mata-pita ke diene se milan karnaa he
 If Odisha's former DGP and Bitti's father b
 bi
 If Mohanty and his mother Shubhra refused to give blood samples, it could be a very lengthy legal process
 bitti ko bhi yah adhikaar he ki vah apane khun kaa namoona dene se manaa kar de
 In such a situation, the other option would be to match his face and pieces to his picture in the police records by scientific means
 is baat kii sambhaavna kam he ki police record main uske fingerprint maujuud hon kyonki pehali baar hiraasat main liye jane ke vakt uski pahchaan ko lekar koi vivaad nahin tha
 The third and final way to determine his identity is to stick to how closely the Kerala Police is able to target his fake documents
 espi nair ne india today ko bataaya, ''hamane is maamle ko lagbhag sulajhaa liya he
 Surely it is a case of fake disguise and fraud
 ”ab tees saal ke ho chuke bitti ne agar pehle tay kii gai apni sajaa kaat lee hoti to vah kuch maheene baad reeha ho jane kii sthiti main hota
 From here, he is more likely to get harsher and longer sentences

 He knew that it was not the right environment to open a factory for safety shoes in Gwalior
 baavjood iske unhone factory kholkar logon ko prashikshit kiya
 The factory was gradually expanded and today its total construction area is four and a half million square feet

 is pej ke kareeb 50 lakh folbers hai
 The caption is written with the picture- 'original photo of Bhagat Singh
 coment main jai hind likhen
 Thousands of people responded to this photo
 saath hi bhagat singh ko shradhanjali bhi di
 However some people like Sheetal Chauhan and Rahul Singh wrote that this picture is not of Bhagat Singh
 india today kii fact check team ne apni padtaal main paaya ki ye tasviir bhagat singh kii nahin balki farrukhabad ke nawab nawab tafaazzul hossain khan kii he
 We began our investigation with a reverse search of the picture
 isse ham internet ke kai link tak pahunche jahaan tasviir main dikh rahe shaks ko nawab tafaazzul hossain khan bataaya gaya
 Our correspondent from Farrukhabad contacted Kazim Ali Khan Bangash, the great-grandson of Taffajul Hussain Khan, to know the reality of the picture
 bangash ne tasviir unke padadada kii hone kii pushti kii
 Bangash told India Today - 'tafazul Hussain Khan was the last Nawab of Farrukhabad, who took the iron from the British rule
 unhen 1857 main swatantraaa senaniyon kii madad karne kii vajah se pehle maut kii sajaa sunai gai phir makka nirvasit kar diya gaya
 'this picture also found a place in the famous Journal La Trobe, which was produced by the State Library Victoria
 jaranal main ‘images of Empire: Sir Henry Barkly’s Photograph album, 1858-1877’ naam se lekh main nawab tafaazzul hossain khan kii tasviir ko jagah di gai he
 The caption of the photo read, "the Nawab of Farrukhabad was expelled from India for his crimes during the mutiny, now living in Mecca
" ’janemaane lekhak wiliam biel ne apni kitaab ‘the Oriental Biographical Dictionary’, main tafaazzul hossain khan ko ‘farrukhabad kaa baagi nawab’ bataaya
 An excerpt from the book reads - "this man dependent on the British killed 62 British men, women and children during the 1957 rebellion
" ’ kitaab main aage likhaa gaya- ‘nawab ke sarender ke baad mukadmaa chalaaya gaya or doshi qaraar die jane ke baad nawab ko maut kii sajaa sunai gai
 
 
 The Nawab chose to go to Mecca
 ’tafaazzul hossain khan ke padpote se mili jaankaree, australian jaranal or kitaab main die anshon se ek hi nateeja niklaa or wo nateeja he ki tasviir bhagat singh kii nahin tafaazzul hossain khan kii he
 To call the person Bhagat Singh in the picture is misleading

 in / In Yamuna Nagar, Haryana, a case of beating and beating children with chains has come to light after a madrasa failed to complete homework
 is maamle kaa khulaasa tab hua jab madrase main zanjeeron main bandhe hue ek bachche kaa video saamne aayaa he
 Based on this video, police have registered a case against two teachers of the madrasa
 jaankaree ke mutabik, jile ke khijrabad kasbe ke bombepur madrase main homework nahin kar paane par shikshak bacchon ko zanjeeron se baandhakar pitayee karte the
 One such madrasa child told the story of this torture to his father Ayub
 duusare din jab pita madrase pahunche to dekha unka betaa zanjeeron se bandhaa hua mila, jise dekh vah dang rah gaye
 The father of the victim's child said that he had made a video of it
 khijrabad thane main isaki likhit shikaayat di
 After this, the police interrogated the children of the madrasa and based on the video footage, the madrasa registered a case against two teachers, Sabir and Mubarak
 shikshakon dwaara bacchon ko di ja rahi is pratadna se logon main gussa he
 Police said that a complaint has been registered against the accused teachers under sections 323, 342, 506 / 34 and JJ Act against the accused teachers on the complaint of the father of the victim child
 is sambandh main madrase ke bacchon or anya shikshakon se poochtacha kii gai he
 The accused teachers are currently absconding from the spot, who hail from UP
 unki talaashi ke liye dabish di ja rahi he
 The mannerisms of Sonia Gandhi, who does not care about the ground realities before taking important decisions, are also strange
 yah baat ek baar phir us samay sabit hui, jab unhone 2012 main hone vaale vidhansabha chunaavon main congress kaa netritv karne ke liye reeta bahuguna-joshi ko dobaaraa pradesh congress adhyaksh pad par manonith kar diya
 He did this despite the fact that bahuguna-joshi has strong opposition at the state and center level in the organization
 or phir, khud bahuguna-joshi ne ayodhya main vivaadaaspad sthal par malikana daawey ko lekar hycourt ke faisle kaa swaagat karke congress ke nikat aa rahe musalamaanon ke ek bade tabake ko asamanjas main daal diya tha
 In fact, bahuguna-joshi's cautious reaction to the High Court's decision was understood to be that the Congress is once again pursuing questionable politics, rather than taking a firm stand in the Babri Masjid case
 apni ukat tippanee main unhone kaha tha, ''rajanetaaon ko isse (vivaad se) dur rahanaa chahie
 Let both sides find a way out
 ham apana dhyaan aam aadmi par banaae rakhenge
 "but neither the opposition to his re-nomination as the state party chief nor the resentment among the Muslims about the party's stance in Lucknow and Delhi is on the ability of bahuguna-joshi to help Sonia Gandhi win Uttar Pradesh again
" Could not stop expressing confidence
 sarvavidit he ki party main uttar pradesh ke prabharee mahasachiv digvijay singh bhi shuruyaat main vahaan netritv parivartan chaahate the
 This huge state, which is getting ready for elections, is also the home state of the nehru-gandhi family
 sonia gandhi ko 62 varsh kii is dubli-patali mahila par bhale hi bharosa ho or ve unase apeksha kar rahi hon ki rajya kii maharathi mukhyamantri mayawati se do-do haath karne ke liye unki ridh ispaat jaisi majboot hogi, lekin sthiti sahi disha main viksit nahin ho rahi he
 Within a week of reassigning the post of state party president to bahuguna-joshi, Rahul Gandhi abruptly abandoned his mission 2012, saying that it was not his idea but a brainchild of the media
 12 november ko lakhanu main yuvak congress ke kaaryakartaaon kii band kamare main hui baithak ko sambodhit karte hue rahul ne vyangyatmak andaaj main kaha ki unka koi mishan 2012 nahin he
 "" This mission can also be 2012, 2017 or 2020
 hamaara lakshya party ko apane boote bahumat main pahunchaana he
 'despite the fact that bahuguna-joshi also claims Rahul's support, the party leader in Lucknow interprets his leader's decision to convert Mission 2012 into an indefinite mission
 unke mutabik, rahul ko bamushkil 18 maheene baad hone vaale chunaavon main mayawati ke haath se satta chin sakane main rajya ikai kii kshamta par bharosa nahin rahaa he
 There are reasons to believe so
 mayawati kii baari-bharkam jeet ke maatr chaar maheene baad sitambar 2007 main, jabase bahuguna-joshi ko pradesh party adhyaksh manonith kiya gaya he, congress prayek up-chunaav main harati rahi he or jamaanat bhi jabt karaati ai he
 Yes, he can definitely be given credit that the party snatched the Lucknow (west) seat from the BJP
 ise 'aitihaasik jeet' isliye mana gaya, kyonki congress ne 1984 ke baad pehali baar yah pratishthit seat jiti thi
 There may have been many other reasons behind his re-nomination, but according to a senior party leader, the nature of the nehru-gandhi family in favor of bahuguna-joshi also changed that this family never takes any decision under pressure
 is baat ko samajhe bina ek taraf to ek gut ne sonia par bahuguna-joshi ko hataane kaa dabaav daalane kii koshish kii, or duusari taraf varisht kendriya netaaon kii saraparasti vaale ek anya gut ne congress vidhayak dal ke netaa pramod tiwari ko is pad par niyukt karne kaa dabaav daalaa
 Like bahuguna-joshi, Tiwari too belongs to the Allahabad region
 magar dabaav ke hatkande sonia ko pasand nahin aae or unhone puri tarah sakriy bahuguna-joshi ko phir se niyukt kar diya, jo umr main congress ke anek pradesh adhyakshon kii tulana main badi hai
 After all, there are very few leaders who can work for 16 hours and walk for miles to join the public
 netaaon ne sonia gandhi se yah shikaayat bhi kii thi ki bahuguna-joshi apane divangat pita hemavathi nandan bahuguna par likhi ek pustak main divangat indira gandhi ko 'ahamkaari' qaraar de chuki hai
 But bahuguna-joshi says that he himself has brought this information to Sonia and has also made it clear to her why and in what context she wrote it
 aantarik sutron ke anusaar, bahut kam log yah baat jaanate hai ki sonia ne nehru-gandhi gharaane kii janmasthali elahabaad se khud koi netaa khojkar laane or use taiyaar karne kaa kaam bilkul gupachup tareeke se kiya
 Party sources say that Sonia was constantly keeping an eye on this former professor of Indian history who spoke and could communicate easily with the youth and the elderly through her own non-political system associated with Anand Bhavan and Swaraj Bhavan
 iske alaava, rajya main koi aisa netaa bhi to nahin tha, jo bahuguna-joshi kaa sthaan le saktaa
 Although Pramod Tiwari was successful in drawing attention to himself this time, but his habit of getting the color of his jacket similar to the color of the ruling party went against him
 jahaan tak anya netaaon kii baat he, ve yaa to ateet main parakhe ja chuke the, yaa phir centre main mantri padon se hi khush hai
 In addition, two leaders of the state as ministers at the Center

 varun dhawan kii film 'badlapur' ko sensor board kii taraf se 'e' certificate diya gaya he
 The 'U A' certificate was expected earlier for this film, but it did not happen
 sensor board ne 'badlapur' ko 'yue' certificate dene ke liye film ke kai drishyon ko kaatane ke liye kaha tha, jise film ke nirdeshak shriram raghavan ne manaa kar diya
 The Censor Board had asked to extract some scenes as well as lighten up some dark and action scenes to give an 'A' certificate, but director Sriram Raghavan did not want to tamper with his film and its story
 
 isliye raghavan ne film main bina kisi kaatchhaant or badlaav ke 'you e' certificate lenaa hi behatar samajha
 According to Raghavan, removing a scene from a film would compromise the quality of the film
 varun dhawan kii film 'badlapur' ek dark film he, jisamen dher sara ection he
 And yes Varun has done such a film and role for the first time
 varun ke phans ne bhi ab tak unhen halke-phulke lover bvoy ke rup main kamedi karte hue hi dekha he
 The number of his fans is also of youth
 aise main unki film ko 'e' certificate milanaa kam se kam varun ke liye thodaa chintajanak to he hi, kyonki is film ko dekhne bachche cinema gharon tak nahin ja paaenge
 On the other hand, it will also be a matter of concern for the producer, because after getting the 'A' certificate, you get less money than satellite rights

 It is to be noted that during the debate in Parliament, it came out clearly that Operation Duryodhana was done in the public interest and Parliament did not consider any need for any action against journalists

 There was a time when Mansoor Ali Khan, father of actor Saif Ali Khan, was called the Nawab
 lekin bharat kii aazaadee ke baad riyasat vyavastha ko khatm kar diya gaya
 Saif Ali Khan joined Arbaaz Khan's chat show Quick Heel Pinch
 is dauraan unhone bataaya ki paanch dashak pehle kaise unke pita ko apana naam badalanaa padaa?saf ali khan ne bataaya, ''bharat main 1971 main sabhi riyasaton ko khatm kar diya gaya tha
 i think the same year my father lost the post of Pataudi along with the captaincy of the Indian cricket team
 baad main unhone apana naam bhi badal liya tha
 There was also Pataudi in his signature
 is naam se unhen puri life pukaara gaya, lekin us samay bharat sarkaar ne aisi padavi ko gaiyrkanoonee ghoshit kar diya
 "saif told," After this, the father removed Pataudi from his name to Khan and he started calling himself with the same name
 iske saath hi unhone check or anya chizon main apana hastakshar bhi badal diya

 To this, he said," i was born Pataudi, but changed it to Khan after 1971

 That's how we grew up and i think people should know about this

 Talking about the work front, the teaser of Saif Ali Khan's popular web series Sacred Games 2 has been released

 The Indian Mujahideen has stepped up its path towards a dangerous alliance to shake India
 usne duniya ke sabase khatarnaak aatankwaadi sanghathan se haath mila liya he
 The Indian Mujahideen have joined hands with al-qaeda to create a new mission of terror India
 asadullah, urf haddi, urf haidar, urf rashid
 When this terrorist with many names opened his tongue, the security agencies of the country were shocked
 desh main hue kai bam dhamaakon main shaamil indian mujahidin yani iem kaa das lakh kaa inami ye vahi pyaadaa he, jise isi saal 29 agast ko bihar-nepal border se yaccin bhatkal ke saath giraftaar kiya gaya tha
 After the arrest, what Bone has risen in front of the police is shocking
 aatank ke aakaaon ne hindustan ke khilaaf chalaai ja rahi nafrat kii jang kaa dayera ab or bhi zyada failaane kaa faisla kar liya he
 In other words, till now the work of the Indian Mujahideen to sow a crop of hatred and terror in India, the same work is now in place of al-qaeda in place of IM
 haddi ne poochtacha main bataaya he ki dhamaakon se hindustan ko dahalane vaala indian mujahidin ab khud hi apni pahchaan se is kadar ghabara chukaa he ki wo apana naamon-nishaan mitaa dena chahta he, lekin iskaa matlab ye katai nahin he ki ab hindustan main aatankwaadi hamale rukne vaale hai, balki ab yahi kaam sidhe al-kaayda karnaa chahta he, kyonki indian mujahidin ab khud hi apni pahchaan mitaa kar al-kaayda main shaamil hona chahta he
 In recent years, whenever there was a blast in India, the name of Indian Mujahideen, IM, definitely came out
 saath hi in dhamaakon main parde ke peeche se iesai, lashkar-e-taiyyaba or jaish jaise aatankwaadi sanghathanon kaa haath hone kii baat bhi saamne ai
 But this is the first time that al-qaeda wants to directly hijack India
 haddi ke mutabik hindustani khufia or suraksha agenciyon kii sargarmi se ab iem ko yahaan khul kar oparate karne main dikkat ho rahi he
 In such a situation, they have no choice but to change their name and their identity
 haddi ne kaha he ki pichley kuch samay se sanghathan kaa naam badalane ke masale par bhatkal bandhu samet indian mujahidin ke duusare aalaa netaa lagaataar mashvira kar rahe the
 After this, during a meeting in Dubai and Sharjah some time ago, it was decided that instead of increasing proximity with the Pakistani intelligence agency ISI or any other organization, al-qaeda should be directly handed over
 iem kaa maananaa he ki al-kaayda, iesai yaa lashkar-e-taiyyaba ke mukaable jehad ko lekar kahin zyada sanjeeda he
 Players are being auctioned for IPL season-11
 is nilaamee prakriya main rajasthan royles ne diggajon kii jagah 29 saal ke gautam krishnapa ko moti rakam main kharida he
 Gautam was an anonymous player but 6 before IPL Nemami
 2 karod rupaye main bikne ke baad wo surkhiyon main aa gaye hai
 On one hand, from Sixer King Yuvraj Singh to Harbhajan Singh and Gautam Gambhir were bought for less than 3 crores, the auction of this young player is certainly surprising
 gautam isse pehlemumbai indiens kaa hissaathe lekin 2 karod main kharide jane ke baavjood unhen maidan par utarane kaa mauka nahin mila tha
 The franchise was vying to buy Gautam this season, but Rajasthan eventually won

 The Gehlot government may discontinue the Bhamashah Yojana, the largest health scheme of the former Vasundhara government of Rajasthan
 rajya kii vasundhara sarkaar kii sabase lokapriy yojana ko band karne ke liye rajasthan sarkaar ke vitt vibhaag ne sifarish kii he
 Meanwhile, to avoid people's displeasure and bjp's opposition, the Gehlot government has come up with a way to launch the Ayushman Bharat scheme of the Modi government at the Center instead of the Bhamashah scheme
 centre kii ayushmaan bharat jan aarogy yojana ko shuru karne se rajasthan main kareeb 600 karod rupye kii bachat ho sakati he
 Actually, former Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje had first implemented the Bhamashah Yojana for which the card was made
 is card main ek taraf vasundhara raaje kii tasviir thi to duusari taraf bijepi ke chunaav chinh camel kaa nishaan tha
 Saffron and green color of the BJP flag were also made on the card
 iske virodh ko lekar congress court bhi gai thi lekin use munh kii khaani padi thi
 4 under Bhamashah Yojana in Rajasthan
 50 karod log aate hai jis par rajasthan sarkaar 1490 karod rupee kharch karti he
 Under this scheme, insurance cover ranging from 30 thousand to 3 lakh rupees is available
 yojana rajya ke sabhi sarkari aspataalon ke alaava 774 nijee aspataalon main bhi lagu he
 The government of Rajasthan will get Rs 900 crore from the Center by starting the Ayushman Bharat scheme by discontinuing this scheme as the central government bears 60 percent of the expenditure in the Ayushman Bharat scheme and 40 percent has to be paid to the state government
 sabase badi baat he ki is yojana main dedh karod log hi cover ho paaenge jabaki bhamashah yojana ke daayre main 4
 50 crores
 isliye rajasthan sarkaar soch samajhakar faisla lenaa chaahati he
 People do not have to face the displeasure of saving money somewhere
 kyonki mana ja rahaa he ki vasundhara raaje sarkaar ko vidhansabha chunaav main takkar di he to uski sabase badi vajah bhamashah yojana hi thi
 This was the reason why Vasundhara Raje did not stop her plan despite the Central Government's Modi government saying
 vitt vibhaag ne band karne kii sifarish to kar di he lekin rajasthan sarkaar ne abhi koi faisla nahin liya he
 The Empowered Group of Ministers (EGOM) headed by Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar approved a Rs 1,207 crore drought relief package for Maharashtra
 sutron ne kaha ki kul 1,207 karod rupee main se 807 karod rupee rashtriya aapadaa raahat kosh ke tahat rajya main 3,905 gaanvon ko jari kiye jaaenge
 Rabi crop has been destroyed due to drought in these villages
 unhone kaha ki shesh 400 karod rupee rashtriya bagwani mishan ke tahat 1,100 aise gaanvon ko jari kiye jaaenge jahaan sookhaa padane se kharif kii fasal barbaad ho gai he
 It is noteworthy that the Maharashtra government had demanded the release of Rs 1,801 crore under the National Disaster Relief Fund, but the central team recommended the release of Rs 872 crore after assessing the situation
 fasalon ke nuksaan kii bharpai karne ke liye pichley saal is kosh ke tahat rajya ke liye 778 karod rupee manjuur kiye gaye the
 Shinde said that the EGOM has also approved a drought relief package for Kerala and other states
 maharashtra main kul 34 jilon main se sholapur, ahmednagar, sangli, pune, satara, bid or nasik sookhe se sabase adhik prabhavit jile hai
 The situation is also critical in Buldhana, Latur, Osmanabad, Nanded, Aurangabad, Jalna, Jalgaon and Dhule districts
 rajya main kuch jile chaara or peyajal kii gambhir killat kii samasya kaa saamana kar rahe hai
 Officials said that drinking water is being supplied through tankers in most of the affected villages
 sambhav he ki ab desh kii rajdhani dilli ke klbon or restro-bars main aapako deje kaa sangeet sunne ko nahin mili
 The excise department has issued a circular reminding the city of over 900 bars and clubs an old rule
 is niyam ke tahat aap is tarah kii jagahon par recorded mujeec nahin baja sakate
 If this rule is strictly enforced, DJ music will not be played for customers in any club, pub, bar and restaurant
 salmaan sang 1 minute ke promo main dikhi model kii khuli kismat, mila bada brakeis niyam kii vajah se deje ke aakarshan par asar padane kii ashanka he kyonki deje gane aamtaur par popular beats kii rimix ke liye hi jane jate hai
 According to a newspaper report, Delhi's Excise Commissioner Amjad Tak said - All this is according to the Excise Rule 2010
 jisamen likhaa he ki jitne bhi lounj, pubs or restro baar shahar main hai, unke paas el-17 license hona chahie
 According to the rules of this license, only a professional live singer or instrument can be played for guests
 recorded mujeec ko play karnaa isaki avhelnaa mana jayega

 agar aapako white bread or pasta bahut pasand he or aksar naashte main bread yaa pasta hi khate hai to yah aapke liye chintaa kaa vishay ho saktaa he
 a recent study has claimed that white bread and pasta consumption can cause depression
 adhyayan kii report main khulaasa kiya gaya he ki white bread or pasta khaane se aap depressant ke shikaar ho sakate hai
 The high amount of carbohydrates found in it can increase irritability and anxiety in you

 bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar 2017 kii surkhiyon main shaamil ho gaye hai
 He toppled the rjd-jdu-congress mahagathbandhan government in the state on July 26 and became part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's NDA coalition government within an hour
 yani ek ghante main mukhyamantri pad se istipha or nai sarkaar kaa khaakaa taiyaar kar phir mukhyamantri ban janaa
 This is not the first time for Nitish Kumar when he decided to break the alliance
 2014 main bhi unhone mukhyamantri pad se istipha mahaj isliye de diya tha ki unhen narendra modi kaa netritv manjuur nahin tha or tatkaaleen endie gathbandhan se baahar nikal mahagathbandhan bana liya
 While assessing the decisions taken by Nitish Kumar as Chief Minister and as a JDU leader, it can be understood whether he will be called a powerful Chief Minister of Bihar or he will be more fit in the category of a weak Chief Minister
 ye hai kaaran jisane nitish ko kiya kamjor1
 The rjd-jdu-congress mahagathbandhan was the most important link in the country in the name of the opposition after a crushing defeat at the hands of the BJP in 2014
 haalanki loksabhaa chunaav ke nateezon ne is mahagathbandhan kii hawa nikaal di thi
 Then in 2015 it made the BJP a third-tier party in the state in the assembly elections
 lihaaja, rashtriya str par bhi yah mahagathbandhan vipaksh kii raajnneeti ke liye behad ahm tha
 Nitish Kumar's victory in the 2015 elections led to this grand alliance
 lekin 3 saal main vipaksh kii raajnneeti ke gathbandhan kaa netritv karne se nitish ne na sirf manaa kar diya balki ek kadam aage badhkar kendra main sattarudh gathbandhan kaa daaman tham liya
 2
 bataur mukhyamantri bhi rahe sarkaar main kamjor2015 main hue bihar vidhansabha chunaavon main mahagathbandhan ko sarkaar banane kaa mauka mila
 Despite being the number two party, the Grand Alliance projected Nitish Kumar as the Chief Minister of the state by projecting the face of development
 yah nitish kumaar ke liye dohare shatak jaise ho saktaa tha basharte vah apane netritv kshamta se is mahagathbandhan kii sarkaar ko majboot rakh pate
 But to form the government, as soon as he entered politics, Lalu's two sons were not only included in the government but weakened themselves as the Chief Minister of the state by making one as the Deputy CM
 3
 Nitish Kumar, who came into politics with the help of Fitratlalu Prasad Yadav to change the opportunity, got the first opportunity and separated from Lalu
 lalu se pehali baar alag hona nitish ke liye mahatvapurn faisla tha
 In Bihar politics directly emerged as an alternative to Lalu
 rajya ko vikaas kaa mul mantra dene ke naam par bijepi ke saath gathbandhan main rahe lekin jab gathbandhan kaa netritv modi ke haath gaya to phir saath chhod vipaksh ke gathbandhan main shaamil ho gaye
 Once again, when the compulsion to form a government with Lalu came to the fore, Modi became the Chief Minister of Bihar without any opposition
 lekin jaise hi bhrashtachar ke kaale badal gathbandhan par dikhaai diya to ek ghante ke andar mukhyamantri pad kaa ek chola utaar kar doosraa chola pahan liya
 4
 rajya ke vikaas main vifallaalu prasad yadav ke do dashak lambey shashan main ahm bhoomika nibhaane ke baavjood nitish kumaar apane liye vikaas purush kii chhavi banane main kaamyaab rahe
 He kept talking about giving a map of Bihar's development after coming out of the Lalu camp and joining the NDA
 lekin bataur mukhyamantri bihar ko vikaas ke raste main kitna pahunchaa paae iskaa koi thos nateeja rajya ke aarthik aankadon main nahin dikhaai diya
 Therefore, the question is also on his roadmap for the development of Bihar whether he has used 'development' as just a jumla in the politics of Bihar
 5
 After forming the government in 2015 with sendrjd in good governance, there was a chance in 2016 when Mohammad Shahabuddin, a former RJD MP, got bail
 is gathbandhan ke kaarykaal main jamaanat milane ke turant baad shahabuddin ne bayaan diya ki unke liye bihar kaa mukhyamantri lalu prasad yadav hai kyonki nitish kumaar paristhitiyon ke mukhyamantri hai
 Though Shahabuddin's statement was confined to his and Nitish Kumar's relationship, this one statement made a dent in Nitish Kumar's claims of good governance and proved that despite being the Chief Minister in the state, his image was forged for certain elements
 It is only the leader who goes

 Not only this, Rahman got married to a young woman, who he used to teach in a madrasa
 mahila kaa daawa he ki talaak ke baad use ghar se nikaal diya gaya

 students islamic movement of india (simi) ke ye chaar aatankwaadi pichley do saal se faraar hai
 It is said that all the attempts to capture and reach the four terrorists have failed so far
 in chaaron ne mobile phone kii bajaay public telephone booth kaa istemaal kar jaanch agency ko chakma de rakhaa he
 The NIA had registered a case against these four on November 12 in connection with the Bijnor blasts in UP last year

 a top security official said, "these terrorists narrowly escaped being caught
" aatankwaadi telephone booth kaa istemaal kar rahe hai or gudgaanv ke aasapaas ek aise hi booth kaa hamane pataa bhi laga liya tha, lekin jab tak enie kii team vahaan pahunchati, aatanki faraar ho chuke the
 All four are real threats and their attacks are more likely to happen than ISIS in India
 '2013 main madhya pradesh kii jail se hue the fararenie ko mili jaankaree ke mutabik, ye aatankwaadi aadhunik hathiyaaron se las or dakshinpanthi netaaon ke khilaaf badale kii bhaavana se bhare hai

 hamale kii yah koshish viechpi ke ek kaarykram ke dauraan kii gai thi
 The four terrorists, Sheikh Mehboob, Amjad, Zakir Hussain and Mohammad Salik, escaped from a jail in Madhya Pradesh in October 2013 along with Mohammad Ejazuddin and Mohammad Aslam

 ' arundhati roy kaa bahucharchit upanyaas 'da ministry of atmost happines' angreji ke baad ab hindi or urdu main bhi anudit hokar prakashit ho gaya he
 In Hindi it is published by Rajkamal Prakashan in the name of ‘apar Khushi Ka Gharana’ and in Urdu as ‘bepnah Shadmani Ki Mamlikat’
 is upanyaas kaa hindi anuwaad varisht kavi or aalochak mangalesh dabraal or urdu anuwaad arjumand aara dwaara kiya gaya he
 Both these books of translation were released at the India International Center in Delhi
 kaarykram kii shuruuaat daastango darain shahidi dwaara pustak ke anshpath se hui
 Then Sanjeev Kumar and Ashutosh Kumar spoke to writer Arundhati Roy, Hindi translator Manglesh Dabral and Urdu translator Arjumand Ara
 lekhika arundhati roy kaa daawa tha ki 'meri yah pustak ab tak desh-videsh kii 49 bhashaaon main anudit ho chuki he
 Nevertheless, it was completed for me only after coming to Hindi and Urdu
 unhone kaha, "apane pehle upanyaas 'da god of small things’ upanyaas kii safalataa or bukar puraskaar milane ke baad, main chaahati to 'da god of small things' bhaag -2, 3 bhi likh sakati thi, lekin mere liye upanyaas ek puja or meri duniya he
 Arundhati Roy used to say, "the novel is a genre in which you can create a universe through which you invite the reader to walk with you
" yah kahin adhik jatil prakriya he
 But, for me it is satisfying
 main upanyaas likhti hum to mujhe lagata he ki main apane kaushal kaa istemaal kar rahi hum
 It gives me more satisfaction and happiness
 "arundhati ne kaha, 'da ministry of atmost happines' upanyaas ko likhane main bahut samay laga, ise likhnaa mere liye ek paheli ko sulajhane jaise tha
 Answering questions during the conversation, the writer said, 'this is a fraudulent novel
 iske dhokhe ko samajhane ke liye aapako ise kai baar padhanaa pad saktaa he
 'poet and critic Manglesh Dabral shared his experience of translation at the time, stating that "the title of this novel was quite difficult
 ministry shabd ke anuwaad ke liye mahakama, mantralay, sultanate aadi shabdon ke baad 'gharaana' arundhati ko pasand aayaa
 "speaking about the difficulties encountered during translation, he said," In the English novel, Arundhati has used many new words which were very difficult to find in Hindi
 "urdu anuvadak, arjumand aara ne anuwaad ke samay ke apane anubhavon ke bare main bataate hue kaha, "is upanyaas ko arundhati dwaara jis tarah likhaa gaya he or jis tarah ke shabdon kaa chunaav upanyaas main kiye gaye the, unako jyon kaa tyon, khaskar urdu main anuwaad karnaa kaaphi kathin tha
 While writing in Urdu, i have shown complete loyalty on my part so that the characters of the novel come in the same way as in the original language
 " aage unhone kaha, "puraani dilli or kashmir vaale hisse ko anuwaad karne main zyada mushkil nahi aayi
 "ashok Maheshwari, managing director of Rajkamal Prakashan said," It is a great occasion that this important book has been published simultaneously in two major languages of the country - Hindi and Urdu
 yah raajakmal prakaashan ke liye bhi ek aitihaasik kshan he, kyonki 'bepanaah shaadamaani kii mamalikat' raajakmal kii urdu kii pehali prakashit pustak he
 "remember that Arundhati Roy's novel 'the Ministry of Almost Happiness' published in Hindi as 'apar Khushi Ka Gharana' takes us on a journey of many years
 yah ek aisi kahani he jo varshon puraani dilli kii tang bastiyon se khulti hui falte-phoolate nae mahanagar or usase dur kashmir kii vaadiyon or madhya bharat ke jangalon tak ja pahunchati he, jahaan yuddh hi shaanti he or shaanti hi yuddh he
 Where the situation is declared to be normal
 anjum, jo pehle aafatab thi, shahar ke ek qabristaan main apana taar-taar kaaleen bichaati he or use apana ghar kahati he
 One midnight, a baby girl suddenly appears in the litter carousel on the pavement
 rahasmay es
 Tilottama remains as absent as he is present in the lives of the three men who love him
 ‘apaar kushi kaa gharaana’ ek saath dukhati hui prem-katha or asandigdh pratirodh kii abhivyakti he
 He has been spoken of in whispers, in screams, through tears and sometimes with laughter
 uske nayak ve log hai jinhone us duniya ne tod daalaa he jisamen ve rahete hai or phir prem or ummid ke bal par bache hue rahete hai
 For this reason, she is as brittle as she is, and she never surrenders
 yah sammohak, shandaar kitaab nae andaaz main phir se bataati he ki ek upanyaas kya kar saktaa he or kya ho saktaa he
 The charisma of the story-art of Arundhati Roy is recorded on every page of it
 Baahubali has given me opportunities to travel to a number of countries
 
 
 The most exciting of them all is now, Pakistan

 ek jamaana tha jab kabhi rail haadase ke baad rail mantri naitik jimmedaari lete hue istipha de diya karte the, lekin ab samay badal gaya he
 Railways have suspended five officers and transferred the DRM of Jhansi Division for the horrific rail accident in Pukhrayan
 khaas baat yah he ki jis din pukhraayaan main indore patna express patari se utari, us din yani 20 november ko rajdhani dilli ke paas surajkund main ek aaleeshaan hotel main railway ke sabhi bade adhikari mantriyon ke saath rail shivi main hissaa le rahe the
 The news of the accident came but the train camp continued unabated
 tadake 3:10 par rail haadasa hua tha or 9:00 baje tak yah saaf ho chukaa tha ki yah rail haadasa kaaphi bhayanak he or isamen bahut se logon kii jaan chali gai he
 In view of this, soon the Minister of State for Railways Manoj Sinha was rushed to the accident site

 This type of behavior was probably not expected for more than one hundred and fifty people were killed in this accident
 lekin aisa hi hua
 In any major railway accident, it is neither the responsibility of the Railway Minister nor the responsibility of the Chairman of the Railway Board nor the responsibility of any member of the Railway Board
 4 saal pehle sefti ke maamalon main bani kakodakar samiti kii isief coach hataakar alechabi ko chalaane kii jimmedaari jin logon par thi vah is haadase ke liye jimmedaar kaise ho sakate hai? shaayad yahi vajah he kii jaanch puri hone se pehle hi pukhraayaan rail haadase ke maamle main railway ne jhaansi divijan ke paanch afasaron ko suspend kar diya he
 Apart from this, the transfer of DRM SK Agarwal of Jhansi Division has been transferred to Ranchi Division
 lambey arase ke baad yah pehla mauka he, jab rail haadase kii jaanch ke parinaam aane se pehle uttaradaayi aalaa afasaron par karrwai kii gai he
 According to highly placed sources in the Ministry of Railways, this has been done because it will send a message to the railway employees that on the one hand, no negligence will be tolerated, on the other hand there will be confidence in the public that the government will not spare any culprit
 Has been uttaradaayi adhikariyon ke khilaaf karrwipukhraayaan ke paas hue bheeshan rail haadase kii gaaj jin afasaron par giri he vah uttar madhya railway yani ensiaar ke jhaansi divijan ke he

 The FIR against MP Pappu Yadav has been lodged at the Buddha Colony police station in Patna on the statement of the same station head Manoj Mohan
 saasand par aarope he ki wo chaatro ko samuhik aatmadah karne ke liye prerit kar rahe the
 According to the FIR lodged at the Buddha Colony police station, MP Pappu Yadav had gone to the Arts and Crafts College, Patna on July 1, among the agitating students
 jis vakt vah mahavidhyalay main maujuud the, us vakt ek chaatra andolnarat chaatraon ko sambodhit kar rahi thi
 Pappu Yadav was exhorting the student to give a statement of mass self-immolation
 thanadhyaksh ne praathmiki main kaha he ki kisi ko aatmadah ke liye prerit karnaa ek sangyeya aparaadh he
 a case has been registered against Pappu Yadav against Section 153 / 504 of IPC

 Students of Arts and Crafts College Patna have been agitating for the last several months to change the principal of the college

 In support of these students, MP Pappu Yadav went to Arts and Crafts College to meet the students

 There are many other important examinations on this date as well
 rajyasabha chunaav ko lekar congress ke bheetar ghamaasan tej ho chalaa he
 The Congress, which has been reduced to 45 seats in the Lok Sabha, has been showing strength to the government in the Rajya Sabha, but today the difficulty is that after losing in all the states, it has more leaders and less seats to go to the Rajya Sabha
 chidambaram or jairam ramesh ke bich fansaa penchakarnataka se auskar fernandes ke naam ko sonia gandhi ne dobaaraa clear kar diya lekin duusari seat par chidambaram or jairam ramesh ke bich kisko chunaa jaae ye faisla ab tak lataka hua he
 In favor of Chidambaram, the argument is being made that in cases like Ishrat Jahan and Augusta, the Congress needs them to keep the state's support
 duusari ore, jairam kii taraf se kaha ja rahaa he ki subramanyam swami jaison se nipatane ke liye unka hona jaruri he
 Also, the argument is that sending a person from Karnataka to Tamil Nadu will not be politically correct
 kaveri jaise maamle kaaphi samvedansheel hai
 Now the ball is in Sonia's court
 vaise karnataka se ek or seat parcongress kii nigaahahai, lekin is par 13 vot kam pad rahe hai jisko saadhane kii jimmedaari siem siddharmaiya ko di gai he
 If the case is made, a close proximity to the Gandhi family could result in a lottery for Margaret Alva
 upi se sharma yaa sibbalyuun to upi se congress ko ek seat paane ke liye bhi 6 or vidhayakon kii darkaar he
 That is why talk is on Mulayam or Mayawati's surviving mlas
 vivaadaaspad imran masood jaise netaa is seat par rahul kii pasand hai, lekin bakheda na khadaa ho isliye sonia apane kareebi satish sharma ko phir se rajyasabha bhejne ke mood main hai
 On the other hand, Kapil Sibal, who has a better relationship with Mulayam Singh, is also in the race because the Congress will need his votes
 vaise bhi neshnal herald kaa cese bhi sibbal hi dekh rahe hai or behatar vaktaa hone kaa rajyasabha main unako phayda mil saktaa he
 Sushil Kumar Shinde, a close aide of the embittered Shindagandhi family in Maharashtra, is also hoping to go to Rajya Sabha
 gandhi parivaar unako chahta bhi he, lekin maujuuda empi avinaash pandeya rahul gandhi kii pasand hai, aise main scindia kii raah mushkil ho chali he
 Opposition of outsiders in Uttarakhand, after barely surviving the government, there is a lot of fighting in one Rajya Sabha seat of the state
 pehle hi bahari rajbabbar ko rajyasabha bhejne ke baad is baar bahari ko bhejne kaa virodh ho rahaa he
 After the victory of Vijay Bahuguna, the Brahmin state president Kishore Upadhyay and Dalit leader Pradeep Tamta, coming from Garhwal are in the race
 haalanki, harish ravat apni patni renuka ravat ko rajyasabha bhejnaa chaahate the, jo haridwar se loksabhaa chunaav lard kar haar chuki hai, lekin alaakaman ne unhen red signal dikhaa diya he
 In Madhya Pradesh, all the leaders who lost elections in one pomegranate and one hundred sick people have set eyes on one seat in Rajya Sabha
 darasal, yahaan se lo profile vijayalakshmi saadho kaa kaarykaal khatm ho rahaa he
 With the help of Congress leader Suresh Pachauri, he is again looking forward to the ticket, so many big leaders are also in the line
 haalanki, rahul kii kareebi mahila congress adhyaksh shobhaa ojha kaa naam philhal sabase upar chal rahaa he, jo khud empi se aati hai
 Overall, there is a fierce battle in each Rajya Sabha seat, which is why the Congress high command is not able to take a decision till the last moment
 vaise ek vaqt tha jab rajyasabha main bhejne ke liye alaakaman ke paas siten zyaada or netaa kam hote the, par aaj badale vaqt main gini chuni siten or netaaon kii lambii fehrist congress alaakaman ke liye kisi sirdard se kam nahin
 Scam on scam, now another scam is creating ruckus in the house
 koyala ghotaale ko lekar sansad ke donon sadanon main aisa bavaal machaa ki loksabhaa or rajyasabha donon ko sthagit karnaa padaa
 In fact, the CAG report revealed a coal scam of 1 lakh 80 thousand crores

 The BJP had given notice to postpone the question hour citing this news report published in an English newspaper

 His body has been lying unclaimed in the morgue of a hospital in Mumbai since September 29, but no one is coming to get it
 yah khabar mumbai ke ek sandhya dainik ne di he
 Archana wrote in a note before the former model committed suicide by hanging herself from a fan that her boyfriend and another woman abandoned her when she needed them the most

 Her corpse has been lying at the Cooper Hospital in Mumbai since 29 September
 police kaa kahana he ki uske parivaar main koi nikatatam sambandhi jivit nahin he
 His brother Ashwin is in Vadodara jail
 us par aarope he ki usne 78 karod rupee kaa gaban kiya he
 Versova police have written to Vadodara jail officials through Andheri court to release Ashwin on parole so that he can perform the last rites of Archana
 abhi is bare main koi jawaab nahin aayaa he
 Police has also written to the Superintendent of Vadodara Jail to release Ashwin for a short time so that he can do this important work
 lekin is patr kaa bhi jawaab nahin mila he
 Archana was just 26 years old and committed suicide by hanging herself in her house on September 29
 usne likhaa tha ki uske bwoyfriend umr pathan ne use kathinaayee ke dinon main chhod diya
 Pathan has been arrested by the police on charges of abetment to suicide
 bataaya jaataa he ki archana is baat se bhi bahut dukhi thi ki uske bhai aswin ko police ne thagi ke ek maamle main giraftaar kar liya tha
 Archana went to Vadodara several times and kept trying to get her brother free
 usne pathan se bhi madad maangi lekin usne manaa kar diya
 He tried to stay away from her
 niraash archana ne khudakushi kar lee
 Pawan Pandey, who dreamed of becoming an IAS officer by passing the Civil Services Examination organized by the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC), left Delhi from Koderma district of Jharkhand six years ago, he had no idea of the exercise to achieve his goal

 upiessi civil seva pariksha main 'gaiyr-angreji' madhyam evam 'manviki' prishthbhumi ke ummidavaaron ke saath ho rahe kathith bhedbhaav ke virodh main 31 saal ke pawan or bihar ke rahane vaale 29 saal ke neelotpal mrinal beete nau july se dilli ke mukherjee nagar ilaake main aamaran anshan par hai
 The main demand of thousands of civil service candidates supporting Pawan and Mrinal is that the second question paper of the UPSC Civil Services Preliminary Examination 'civil Service Aptitude Test' (CSAT) should be scrapped
 is babat pawan ne kaha, 'sisat aise logon se civil seva main jane kaa mauka chin rahi he, jinaki prishthbhumi gramin rahi he or jinhone angreji madhyam ke skulon se padhai nahin kii he
 From CSAT, English medium candidates - especially those with a background in science, engineering or medical - are benefitting, while candidates from non-english medium and non-science backgrounds are lagging behind
 ' Mrinal agrees with Pawan's words, "CSAT was started with the objective that it would test the administrative qualifications of the candidates, but nothing like this except for 5-6 questions out of a total of 80 in this paper
 Which would test the Civil Service Aptitude
 ' Mrinal said, in the name of examining the administrative qualification of the candidates, the questions of Mathematics, Comprehension, English Comprehension are asked in the CSAT question paper, which candidates from science, engineering and medical background find themselves more comfortable to solve
 
 jabaki manviki prishthbhumi ke gaiyr-angreji madhyam ke ummidavaar in sawaalon kii jatilta main ulajh kar rah jate hai or do ghante kaa vakt kab biit jaataa he, pataa hi nahin chalata
 ' mukherjee nagar main hi rahakar pichley paanch saal se civil seva pariksha kii taiyaari kar rahe vikaas kumaar ne bataaya, 'gaiyr-angreji madhyam ke ummidavaaron ke saath sabase badi samasya ye hoti he ki sisat ke prashnon ke anuwaad itane ghatiya darje ke hote hai ki kabhi-kabhaar arth kaa anarth ho jaataa he
 ' vikaas kaa kahana he ki hindi madhyam yaa gaiyr-angreji madhyam ke anya ummidavaar jab prashn-patr main apni bhashaa main anudit prashnon ko uske badtar anuwaad kii vajah se nahin samaj pate to ve angreji main likhe prashn dekhte hai
 But due to not being comfortable in English, they again return to the question written in their language and in this exercise time passes
 kai baar sawaal ke jawaab pataa hone ke baavjood ve samay rahete use hal nahin kar pate
 As a result, they are eliminated from the competition in the preliminary examination itself
 ' Candidates who have been consistently protesting against CSAT have alleged that the success rate of Hindi medium candidates in the final result of Civil Services Examination during 2005-10 was 15-20%, which was reduced to just 2 in 2013
 3 fisadi rah gai he
 On Friday, Lok Sabha MP Dharmendra Yadav and BJP MP Yogi Adityanath also demanded the abolition of CSAT
 yadav ne kaha ki sisat lagu karnaa gramin prishthbhumi vaale chaatro or hindi bhashi tathaa anya kshetreey bhashabhashi chaatro ke khilaaf ek sajeesh he
 The SP leader said that 45 per cent of the 2008 preliminary examinations, 42 per cent in 2009 and 35 per cent in 2010 were successful candidates who were from rural or Hindi speaking backgrounds, while after the introduction of CSAT, it came down to just 11 per cent

 However, Purushottam Agarwal, a former UPSC member and former professor of Hindi at Jawaharlal Nehru University, was asked about this and said, "I have been a member of UPSC, a constitutional body

 Overall, after listening to aibi's chakra, he felt that he was a sensible and self-respecting youth, not a blatant shock artist
 unhone darshakon ko gudgudaya, gussa bhi dilaayaa, kamedi kii paramparaon ko ekajute karne or hasya-vyangy kaa skool kholane kii baat bhi kahi
 However, it is necessary to step very loudly

 He was in the presence of Bollywood stars in front of an audience, each of whom thought it was disrespectful and was laughing

 Families were also thrilled by his mention in newspapers, even if it was mentioned on the crime page
 ab unki tishart par likhaa rahata he, ''desh kaa kalank
 He also said that Rost started a dialogue on things which were also forbidden

 To this, Bhatt said, "dekha Shiva, it was not roast entertainment but infotainment

 The scope of this dialogue was very wide
 unhone bataaya ki kamedi ke liye kamajoro ko nishaanaa banane kii bajaae taqatvar par prahaar karnaa kyon jaruri he
 Overall, the question is not about the quality of AIB or its comedy
 bhatta ne kaha, ''pichley kuch hafton main bolne kii aazaadee par bahes hui he or log is par baat kar rahe hai
 This dialogue and conversation in itself is a very good sign

 matlab, kuch hi saalon main netflix ne behisaab tarakkee kii he
 In 2017, 40 films were released on Netflix
 anumaan tha ki 2018 tak is par 80 filmein release kar di jaaengi
 After the release of films and TV series on the Internet before the film, the producers had a gap of 12 weeks before releasing it on another website
 par jab se netflix aayaa he tab se isane ye niyam hi badalakar rakh diya he
 Now the day the film is released in the theater, on the same day Netflix also delivers its film to the customers sitting at home

 While Hollywood continues to hurt the industry, Netflix's advantage is only increasing every year
 2015 se lekar abhi tak ise ek saal bhi nuksaan nahin jhelana padaa he
 Netflix earns a profit of up to 300 crores every year
 sawaal he ki netflix ke is dabadabe se hollywood kaise nibatega
 Will Hollywood, a billion-dollar business, allow its theaters to sit on its knees in a new era of technology? Sequels in Hollywood begin a fast-paced Hollywood to work on its already tried tips to meet the challenge of Netflix

 After all, if the sequel of Avengers comes to endgame or Fast and Furious or x Man sequel, then the audience will be waiting with heart
 isliye, hollywood ne 2019 se lekar 2027 tak ke liye kareeb 100 filmon se adhik ke sikval banane kii yojana abhi se shuru kar di he
 But it seems that the river's stream has started vomiting
 hollywood ne jahaan original content kii banisbat sikval par jor diya he vahiin, netflix ne apana original content badhanaa shuru kar diya he, chaahe vah series ho yaa filmein
 In 2016, 25 percent of Netflix content started coming in original

 After former foreign secretary s Jaishankar became foreign minister, it was asked whether he would continue this way of immediate help for the common people who started Swaraj
 lekin jaishankar ne 48 ghante ke andar ye saaf kar diya ki logon ke liye videsh mantri se twitor ke zarie madad maangane kaa rasta khulaa hua he

 subah assi ghat par ganga aarti ustad ke naam rahi, to hameshaa se banaras main ganga-jamuni tahjeeb ke vaahak rahe ustad ke janm din par aarti ke baad vaidic mantrocchar hua phir shehanai ne wo dhun chhedi, jo ustad varshon tak ganga ke kinare baith kar sunaaya karte the
 The tune was "ganga Dwaare Badhaaiyan Baaje"
 iske baad to subahe banaras kaa puraa nazaaraa ustad kii yaadon main lipta dikhaa
 Ustad Bismillah Khan loved the Balushahi sweets of Banaras, so on the occasion of the birthday, the big Balshahi was cut with the appearance of a cake
 ustad kii maanas putree soma ghosh ne unke saath banaras gharaane ke jin geeton ke saath kabhi jugalbandi kii thi, uski prastuti kii
 After this morning program, again the evening was held on the same stage of Assi Ghat, in which the lamp was lit in the middle of the sound of seven clarinets

 Tabla and Sitar were also juggled on the occasion, with their own son Nazim Hussain playing with the maestro on the tabla, Pandit Shivnath Mishra and Devavrata Mishra on the sitar
 baat ustad bismmillah ke janm din kii ho or unki viraasat saheje unke bete jamin hossain bismmillah kii shehanai na guunje ye kaise ho saktaa tha
 Hence, his son first started singing the same tune of Ustad at the entrance of Ganga, which Ustad used to recite to Ganga, and in return Ganga also expressed his sweetness in his voice
 kaarykram main ustad bismmillah ke janm se lekar unke sangeet ke safar par aadhaarit ek laghu film bhi dikhaai gai
 Nearly all the musicians of Banaras were present on this occasion, who gave the height of the instrument, which was once played outside the deodorant, with such a fire that it has become the beauty of the courtyard of people's homes today
 par aise vaadya yantra kaa kisi vishvavidhyalay ke paathyakram main na hone kaa afsos zarur nazar aayaa
 Classical singer Pandit Rajeshwar Acharya said that it is a pity that the instrument that Bismillah had taken to such a height is not taught in any university today
 baharhaal sarkarein bhale na dhyaan de, lekin ustad to logon ke dilon par raaj karte the
 He was settled in every particle of Banaras, so his own city of Benaras not only congratulated him on his birthday, but also lived in his memory

 Salman Khan is famous worldwide for his fitness and bodybuilding
 maujuuda samay main bollywood main kaam karne vaale kai saare yuva abhinayta unhen apana adarsh maanate hai or bhaijan kah kar bulaate hai
 Salman Khan is over 50 years old, but if he is called Uncle by someone, he does not like it
 aaj kal salmaan, sho '10 kaa dam' host kar rahe hai
 During the shooting of the show, a question came as to how many women get irritated and scolded angrily when they are called aunts
 is par salmaan ne apana vaakya bataate hue kaha ki agar unhen koi ankal kah kar bulaata he to wo chidh jate hai
 Salman Khan's farmhouse, on the radar of environmental security, will have to be given in a week
 Sharing an anecdote related to this, Salman said that once he had explained to his friend's children not to call him Uncle
 magar apane swabhaav ke anusaar bacchon ne thik ulataa kiya or salmaan ko phani andaaj main ankal kah kar bulaane lage
 Salman got angry on this and told the children that if they call him again Uncle, he will never talk to the children
 iske baad bacchon ne dobaaraa salmaan ko ankal kah kar nahin bulaayaa
 Did Bobby fade away due to Salman in Race 3? The answer given in this way is Salman's film Race 3, released some time ago
 film ne box offis par sammanjanak kamai kii

 IANS The notification issued in the Union Urban Development Ministry's Master Plan 2021 amendment is not embracing the traders of Delhi

 dukandaaron ke savaldilli main varshon se kaarobaar kar rahe sadar bazaar ke kaarobaariyon kaa sawaal ye he ki kya ekher badhaane se ceiling ruk jaaegi, yaa phir isamen bhi koi pench he
 According to experts, there is no mention of special area in the notification issued by the central government
 jiskaa matlab ye he ki puraani dilli ke bazaaron se bhi kanvarjan charge or parking charge vasula ja saktaa he
 Amendments to the master plan say that markets built before 1962 will be exempted from trading activities under mixed land
 lekin sawaal ab bhi ye he ki aise bazaar vaale dukandaar 1962 se pehle ke saboot kahaan se laaenge
 Because it is not even mentioned in the amendment
 itnaa hi nahin sanshodhit master plan main is baat kaa bhi zikr nahin he ki jo dukaane beete 7 maheenon main sil ho chuki hai wo di-sil kaise hongi
 According to estimated figures, more than 10 thousand shops have been sealed in the last 7 months

 Currently, there are more than 100 local shopping complexes in Delhi
 or ye sabhi complex pehle hi parking kii samasya se jujh rahe hai
 In such a situation, the question also arises whether the Municipal Corporation will be able to arrange parking for the shopping complex

 team india ke captain mahendra singh dhoni kaa kahana he kisi bhi khilaadi ko ek kharaab siries ke kaaran team se baahar nahin kiya janaa chahie
 Before the start of the long tour of England, Dhoni said on Wednesday that players should get a chance to return to form
 dhoni ne england pahunchane ke baad apane pehle press conference main kaha, 'meraa maananaa he ki khilaadiyon kaa samarthan karnaa mahatvapurn he
 It does not matter whether he is a captain, a batsman or a bowler
 ' team india 2011 ke niraashajanak daure ko bhulaakar guuruuvaar ko yahaan teen divasiy abhyaas match se sakaaratmak shuruyaat karne kii koshish karegi
 When Dhoni was asked about England captain Alastair Cook during the conference, the Indian captain said, 'every player goes through a bad phase and you need to take the side of the player at the right time, because when you make big innings
 Everyone will be with you at that time
 ' dhoni ne kaha ki yah media ke liye bhi jaruri he ki vah samajhe ki pichhali baar jab ham yahaan aae the tab kaisaa pradarshan tha or tab kya likhaa gaya tha
 Significantly, Cook's poor form led to his team losing the series against Sri Lanka

 The central government may on Wednesday bring an ordinance to amend the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC)
 ummid jataai ja rahi he ki isamen sarkaar ghar kharidaaron ko bhi us shrenee main shaamil kar sakati he, jahaan ve bhi 'creditor' ban jaaenge
 This can make it quite easy for home buyers to get their money back
 maujuuda samay main home byrs ke liye atake project main fanse apane paise ko hasil karnaa kaaphi mushkil hota he
 IBC also does not have some better provisions to help home buyers
 maujuuda samay main ye he vyavastha:ibisi ke maujuuda swaroop main home byrs ko 'ansikyord creditor' ke taur par shaamil kiya gaya he
 The reason for this is that when a real estate company does not fulfill its promise to give a house and faces insolvency, the home buyers have no role in this process
 isamen shaamil hone kaa adhikaar sirf bank or vittiya karjadaataaon ko hota he
 What is the change? According to the expected government sources, the government can make changes in the IBC through an ordinance
 isamen home byrs ko bank or anya vittiya karjadaaron kii shrenee main rakhaa ja saktaa he
 If this happens, the money paid by the home buyers to buy the house will also be included as 'commercial borrowing'
 is tarah byrs ke liye bhi apana paisa hasil karnaa kaaphi aasaan ho jayega
 Let us know that there are many such projects of real estate companies across the country which are running financially
 isaki vajah se paise chukaane ke baad bhi home byrs ko ghar nahin mil paa rahaa he
 They have to fight a legal battle to get their money back

 An adolescent of 16 years of Indian origin in Germany solved a mathematical question posed by the famous mathematician and physicist Sir Isaac Newton
 shanivaar kii ek rapat ke mutabik yah sawaal 350 varsh se adhik samay se ganitagyon ke liye ek paheli bana hua tha
 According to the newspaper Daily Mail, scientists previously used computers to perform such calculations, which has been solved by Shaurya Ray
 re ke is samaadhaan kaa arth yah he ki vaigyanik ab yah pataa laga sakate hai ki kisi gend ko phenke jane par vah kis raste se gujaregi or vah kis prakaar diwaar se takaraayegi tathaa kis prakaar takaraakar waapas lautegi
 According to the newspaper, Ray came to know of this question when he was taken to Drisden University as part of a tourism program, where a professor told him about the question that it could not be resolved
 samachar patr ke mutabik re ne kaha, "maine khud se poocha ki main ise kyon nahin sulajhaa saktaa hum
 " re ne chah varsh se hi ganit ke jatil prashnon ko suljhaana shuru kar diya tha
 The comments re chaar saal pehle kolkata se germany pahunchaa he
 He did not know German then, but now he is proficient in it
 samachar patr ke mutabik uski pratibha ko dekhte hue use do kaksha upar kar diya gaya
 Right now he is giving classes exams ahead of schedule
 samachar patr daily mail ke mutabik vaigyanik pehle is tarah kii gananaa karne ke liye computer kaa istemaal kiya karte the, jise shaury re ne sulajhaa liya he
 Ray's solution means that scientists can now figure out which path a ball will pass when it is thrown, and how it will hit the wall and return
 samachar patr ke mutabik re ko is sawaal kaa pataa tab laga jab use ek paryaton kaarykram ke tahat drisaden vishvavidhyalay le jaaya gaya tha, jahaan ek professor ne use is sawaal ke bare main kaha ki ise suljhaayaa nahin ja saktaa he
 According to the newspaper, Ray said, "I asked myself why i can't solve it
" " Ray started solving complex mathematics questions from the age of six
 tippaniyan Ray arrived in Germany from Kolkata four years ago
 tab use german bhashaa nahin aati thi, lekin ab vah isamen paarangat he
 According to the newspaper, seeing his talent, he was raised two classes

 bijepi kuch isi tarah pradhanmantri narendra modi ke santhnik hero shah ke upar chipki bihar or dilli kii sharmnaak haar ko brahmaputra kii dharti par dhonaa chaahati he
 Shah became the first to look after Assam again and set a blueprint for forming his government in the Northeast
 adhyaksh chune jane ke do din baad jab desh ganatantr diwas manaa rahaa tha, shah assam kii ranneeti ko lekar udhedbun main lage the
 On 26 January, he called all the state strategists including Assam BJP President and Union Sports and Youth Affairs Minister Sarbananda Sonowal before the parliamentary board meeting on 28 January
 sonoval bongigaanv main nehru yuva centre sanghathan kii ore se yojit tayshuda sarkari kaarykram ko chhod 27 kii raat dilli pahunch gaye
 In a nearly three-hour meeting with Assam-based party strategists & national organizations General Secretary Ramlal, election in-charge Ram Madhav, Union Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan, in-charge Mahendra Singh and Sonowal, on January 28, Shah had a detailed consultation on the Chief Ministerial candidate and possible alliances
 Of
 sonoval ko ummidavaar banane par sahmati bani to sawaal uthaa ki iskaa elaan kab kiya jaae? sutron ke mutabik, shah ne fouran kaha ki “aaj shaam sansadeey board kii baithak he, jahaan pradhanmantri bhi honge
 Today, Sonowal is declared the chief ministerial candidate
 ”sarbanand sarvecervb tak ke vidhansabha chunaavon main narendra modi lahar par savaar hokar kudane vaali bijepi kaa assam main sthaneey netritv ko aage badhaane kaa faisla sahaj nahin tha
 But the defeat of Bihar and Delhi was in Shah's mind
 bihar kii haar ke baad hi party ne sthaneey netritv ko tavajjo dene kii manshaa bana lee thi, jiske tahat assam main sonoval ko pradesh adhyaksh or chunaav abhiyaan samiti kaa pramukh banaakar mukhyamantri project karne ke sanket die gaye
 But when the state's Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi told his contest in the Assam elections with Modi, the BJP, who had lost his hand in Bihar, felt that this could be difficult
 dilli main bhi aakhri vakt main sanghathan kii bajaae bahari ummidavaar kiran bedi ko project kar party apane logon ko samajha nahin paane kaa hashr dekh chuki thi
 Therefore, Shah decided to declare Sonowal as the chief ministerial candidate even before the electoral furore so that the election would turn into Sonowal vs Gogoi instead of Modi
 52 varshiya sonoval kii saaf-suthri or urjavan netaa kii chhavi or unki lokapriyata bhi bijepi netritv ke faisle ko aasaan bana gai
 This is the first strategic shift in the 19-month tenure of the modi-shah era BJP
 sutron ke mutabik, assam main bihar kii tarah pradhanmantri modi kii dhuandhar reliyaan nahin hongi
 According to a senior party leader, "modi is thinking of holding at least rallies in the state, because our strategy is to advance the local leadership in the elections
" ” modi 19 janvari ko hi kokarajhaar main bodo pipuls front-bijepi kii sanyukt raily se chunavi aagaaj kar chuke hai
 The party's strategy is to campaign with Modi in areas where the social equation is suitable for the BJP
 hindu or janajaatiy dhruvikaranbihar main nitish-lalu-congress mahagathbandhan se upje saamaajik sameekaran ke saamne post bijepi ne assam main behad sadhi ranneeti apanaai he
 He feared that the Congress could form a grand alliance with the All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) in Assam, but this did not happen
 bijepi ke ek varisht ranneetikaar bataate hai, “hamane bihar jaisi galati yahaan nahin hone di
 Had the congress-aiudf alliance formed, it would have been a situation like Bihar
 congress se pehle hi hamane bodo piples front (bipief), assam gana parishad (agypi) samet tamaam janajaatiy dalon raaba, missing, karbi, dimasa, tiwa aadi ko apane saath laane kii koshishen shuru kar deen
 An alliance with the BPF is in place, negotiations are on with the rest
 ”assam main jammu-kashmir ke baad sabase zyada 34 fisadi muslim aabaadi he
 Therefore, the party is moving rapidly towards making a bouquet of Bangladeshi Hindu refugees, Assamese Hindus, all tribal groups and social groups associated with tea garden

 BJP leaders believe that before the release of the election notification, the central government will take a decisive initiative on this demand
 bade hausale, par chunauti bhi kam nahiloksabhaa chunaav main assam main sabase zyada vot hasil karne vaali bijepi ke hausale us vakt buland ho gaye jab farvari 2015 ke sthaneey chunaav nateezon main usne jabardast jeet hasil kii
 There are 34 boards and 42 town committees in Assam
 board ke 477 vaardon main se bijepi ne 228 siten jeetin or 23 bordon par kabja jamaa liya
 Out of 269 wards of 42 town committees, BJP won 135 and won 28 committees
 is jeet ke baad bijepi ne vidhansabhavar khaakaa taiyaar kiya or loksabhaa chunaav ke aadhaar par badhat vaali 69 vidhansabha siton or duusare number par rahi 23 siton ko lakshya banaaya
 Initially, the party aimed for Mission-84, but Ram Madhav, after assuming charge of election in-charge, removed it to target all 126 seats
 party ne 80 siton ko e shrenee main rakhaa he, jabaki 10-15 siten bi plus shrenee main shaamil hai
 Buoyed by the growing mass base in Assam, the BJP has launched a campaign called Assam Nirman, in which all ministers of the Modi government have a strategy to enumerate the work done by visiting the state and prepare a vision document by taking feedback from the public
 rajya ke prabharee mahendra singh kehete hai, “modi sarkaar ne pichley 19 maheene main assam ke liye kaaphi kaam kiya he jisamen teen trainen chalaane, hindu sharnaarthiyon ke liye adhisuchana, kokarajhaar main oparation ol out, myanmar main ghuskar ugravadiyon kaa safaya
 These are some of the things that have created an atmosphere in the state that Assam will be safe if BJP comes
 ” party assam main bihar ke 2005 ke chunaav kii tarah hi 15 saal jangalraj kii aawaaj buland kar congress kii tarun gogoi sarkaar ko kathghare main khadaa karegi
 In which he has high hopes from Hemant Biswa Sarma, who recently left Congress and joined BJP
 lekin bijepi kii badi chunauti loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan kiye gaye vaade hi hai
 He promised to repatriate the Bangladeshi infiltrators when he came to power, but did not implement it till date
 isi tarah assam kii ek inch jameen nahin dene kaa bharosa diya gaya tha, lekin bangladesh ke saath land boundry agreement main rajya kii kai acre jameen chhin gai
 But unaware of this, the BJP is promising Modi's development and a secure Assam

 The Nehru Yuva Kendra organization, which comes under Sonowal's ministry, has amended and expanded its field of work among students
 jisaki shuruyaat assam se hi kii gai he
 Organization member Dinesh Pratapsingh says, "so far there have been 6 youth conclaves among young students including Silchar, Naugaon, Lakhimpur, Dibrugarh, Bongaigaon and Guwahati
 ”sanghathan or parivaar mustaidabijapi kaa daawa he ki rajya main uski sadsyta 3,51,000 se badhkar 30 lakh ho chuki he
 In terms of organization, the party has divided Assam into 36 districts
 november main hi 126 varisht netaaon ko chhaantkar booth rachana kii jimmedaari di gai jinamein se 118 vidhansabha kshetron main booth gathan ho chukaa he, lekin kuch muslim ilaakon main party safal nahin ho pai he
 Each booth has at least 20 members
 sanghathan ke lihaaj se bijepi ne vidhansabha se lekar panchayat str tak ek team khadi kar lee he
 The role of the Sangh Parivar is very important in Assam and there is tremendous coordination in the family for this election
 rajya bijepi ke sanghathan mantri lagaataar sthaneey sangh netaaon ke sampark main hai to kendriya netritv kii ore se bhi tainaat ranneetikaar kshetreey prachaarak, sah kshetreey prachaarak or praant prachaarak ke saath saptahik mantranaa karte hai
 With Shah's mantra "to win Assam in any case", the BJP has prepared the blueprint for the election at the level of the organization, government-union
 lekin jis brahmaputra nadi kii god main based assam ko jitkar shah party ke andar or baahar ke virodhiyon ko makul jawaab dena chaahate hai, us vistrut aakaar vaali nadi kii alag prakruti he
 In fact, the Brahmaputra is a great river that flows at a very high rate of thunder, in such a situation, it is to be seen whether the BJP will be able to take a dip in this holy river to clear the tightness of its two defeats or else its fast flow leads it to bihar-delhi Will go

 On the PM candidature, he said, 'the party is paramount in the BJP and the party will decide on the PM candidate
 is sambandh main kisi tarah kii atakalein nahin lagaai jaani chahie
 This is Shivraj Singh Chauhan's tweet (shivrajsingh Chouhan @chouhanshivraj) # Reports in certain sections of media around my objection to Shri @narendramodi being declared as PM candidate are baseless & misleading
 # In BJP, the party is supreme and it will decide and declare the PM candidate at right moment

 satyam ghotaale ke sabhi das aropiyon ko hyderabad kii vishesh sibiai court ne doshi qaraar diya he
 a look at Satyam Computer and 10 special things related to this scam
 
 
 
 1
 satyam computer kii sthapana 1987 main hui
 In 1992, it was converted into a public limited company
 iske baad ye bisai, enesai, enwyesai main listed hui
 The company was founded by Ramalinga Raju, who traditionally belonged to an agricultural family in Andhra Pradesh
 2
 Ramalinga Raju started the company with just 20 employees
 jab company ghotaale main fansi tab 66 deshon main company kaa kaarobaar failaa hua tha or isamen kareeb 53 hazaar karmchaaree kaam karte the
 Ramalinga Raju remained the chairman of Satyam Computers until January 7, 2009
 3
 Satyam Computers and Ramalinga Raju quickly gained a place in the computer solution market
 arnest and yang ne ramalinga raju ko 1999 main saal kaa interpriyanyor chunaa
 In 2002, he also received the honor of Asia Business Leader
 2008 main corporate gavarnence ke liye golden pekac award se bhi raju ko sammanit kiya gaya
 4
 satyam ghotaale ko desh kaa ab tak kaa sabase bada audit frod mana jaataa he, jo 7 janvari 2009 ko saamne aayaa tha
 The founder and then chairman of this company, B
 ramalinga raju ne khud mana unhone kaaphi samay tak company ke khaaton main hera-pheri kii thi or varshon tak munafa badha-chadhaakar dikhaaya tha
 Two days after this revelation, Raju was arrested by the Crime Investigation Branch of Andhra Pradesh Police along with his brother Rama Raju and others
 5
 On January 22, 2009, the CID told the court that a total of 40,000 employees worked in Satyam
 company ne inhen karmchaariyon kii sankhya ko 53 hajaar bataaya hua tha
 Raju was drawing Rs 20 crore every month as salary for these thirteen thousand employees
 6
 Raju diverted the investors' money to Mayta Infra and Mayata Properties, a company formed in the name of his sons, without informing the investors
 iske alaava un par company ke munafa galat darshane kaa aarope bhi tha
 In the 6-year investigation, more than three thousand documents and the statements of 226 eyewitnesses were formed
 7
 According to Sebi, 6 crore investors were looted by Satyam's debtors to the tune of Rs 7800 crore through fraudulent transactions
 ye aisa frod tha, jo ek din main nahin ho saktaa tha
 This had been going on for a long time because Ramalinga Raju was doing it with the help of his auditors
 8
 Satyam had also filed fraud complaints in 2001 and 2003, but the complaints were not taken seriously then
 yahaan tak ki world bank ne iske saath kisi bhi tarah ke len dein par 8 saal kii pabandi laga rakhi thi
 9
 ghotaale ke saamne aane se pehle satyam bharat kii iti companiyon main chauthe sthaan par thi
 Satyam became India's least valuable IT company after the scandal surfaced
 10
 However, Mahindra & Mahindra later acquired Satyam Computers
 july, 2009 main satyam kaa naam mahindra satyam ho gaya
 On March 21, 2012, Mahindra Satyam was merged with Tech Mahindra after the board of the two companies approved the acquisition

 After these arguments, Chief Justice Thakur accepted the plea of the petitioner and said that the hearing will be held in February

 Five days after the central government banned 500 and 1000 currency notes, Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) president Lalu Prasad on Thursday lashed out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, breaking the silence in the matter
 unhone twit kar likhaa, "ham kaledhan ke viruddh hai, par aapke krity main doordarshita or kriyanvayan kaa purna abhaav dikh rahaa he
 Take care of common man's convenience
 " notebandi kar japan gaye modi ne lautne par jo bhaashan die, un par tanj kasate hue lalu ne kaha ki 'naatakeey' bhaashanon se aam janata ko na santvanaa milegi or na hi dukhon kaa ant hoga
 RJD President Lalu said about 12 tweets Sunday evening, targeting the central government and the Prime Minister, denouncing demonetisation
 unhone twit kar likhaa, "ham kaledhan ke viruddh hai, par aapke krity main doordarshita or kriyanvayan kaa purna abhaav dikh rahaa he
 Take care of common man's convenience
 " In another tweet, the former Union Minister wrote tightly on Modi's promise, "modi ji, trust the country that after giving two months of complete inconvenience to the public and extortion of black money, Rs
 15 lakh will come into everyone's account
 " lalu yaheen nahin ruke
 He further said that even if people did not get 15 lakh rupees after doing all this, it would mean that it was a 'fake strike' and also a 'fake-encounter' of the general public
 modi sarkaar se sawaal karte hue lalu ne twit kiya, "kya sarkaar 50 din ke baad aankada sawarjanik karegi ki khaaton main paise hone ke baavjood kitne log khaane or ilaaj ke abhaav or sadame main maare gaye
 Modi should explain why if he wants to end corruption and black money, then he made a 2000 rupee note? The country is skeptical of your intention
