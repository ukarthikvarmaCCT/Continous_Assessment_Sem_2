 4 crores ankal sam yani america sari duniya par nigahen rakhata he, yah koi nayaa khulaasa nahin he lekin yah ki 2010 main usne bijepi kii nigaraanee kii yaa yun kahen ki jasusi kii
 Surprisingly, he also supervised the Muslim Brotherhood of Egypt simultaneously
 duniya bhar main kul paanch raajnneetik dalon par uske jasusi sanghathan rashtriya suraksha agency (enese) ne nigahen rakhi
 It is legitimate to spy on your rivals or enemies and most countries do so, but this is a matter which is surprising to hear about
 enese ko america main jasusi karne ke liye aseemit adhikaar mili hue hai or yah agency aisa karti rahati he
 She keeps spying on organizations and countries in dozens, not hundreds
 itnaa hi nahin enese world bank, imef, europea union or international atomic energy agency ke kaaryakalapon par bhi nazar rakhata he
 That is, he monitors every organization or country from which he has any interest
 diarector of neshnal intelligence ne haal main bataaya ki 2013 main america sarkaar ne 90,000 videshi nagarikon or sanghathanon kii jasusi kii
 This is not a new thing
 American agencies have been spying on people and organizations of other countries since long ago
 unhen sarkaar kii ore se bahut adhikaar mili hue hai
 In 2008, a law was also made for this
 iske baad se to jaise ki jasusi kii baadh aa gai he
 The result of this is that in this way the sinister work of spying on others is being done
 ab sawaal he ki dusron kii jasusi karke america adhikari kya un maanav adhikaron kaa ulanghan nahin kar rahe hai jinaki ve hameshaa duhai dete rahete hai? sawaal yah bhi he ki kya ve un soochnaaon kaa durupyog to nahin kar rahe hai?teesraa bada sawaal he ki is baat kii kya guarantee he ki un soochnaaon ko vah dusron tak nahin pahunchaate honge? yah ek nihaayat hi ahamkaari or samrajyavaadee kadam he jo america uthaata rahata he
 Will his dream of becoming the world's greatest military power unquestionably be fulfilled by such steps? How many such steps America has taken for its own interests
 inase to yahi andeh hota he ki vah ek loktantric desh nahin balki ek aisa desh he jahaan janata kii nahin balki pentagon yaa siie athwa enese jaisi jasusi agenciyon kii chalati he
 It is a terrible situation for democratic systems to go back there in such a way that threatens the freedom of every country of the world
 ab samay aa gaya he ki duniya ke tamaam desh ankal sam kii is taak jhaank ke tareeke par aitraaj jataaen

 aam dharna he ki zyada sex se sambandh adhik behatar hote hai lekin iske vipareet ek shodh ke anusaar, saptaah main ek baar shaareerik sambandh banane vaale jode apekshaakrit zyada khush rahete hai
 According to Amy Moose of the University of toronto-mississauga, Canada, more and more sex has been associated with pleasure but once a week sex is better
 moose ke mutabik, shodh ke nishkarsh bataate hai ki apane saathi ke saath antarang sambandh banaae rakhana jaruri he par iske liye roj sex karne kii koi jarurat nahin he
 Although many previous researches have been reported that more sex gives more pleasure
 30,000 america nagarikon par chaar dashakon tak kiye gaye is shodh main pehali baar yah pataa chalaa he kigin jodon ne saptaah main ausatan ek se zyada baar sex kiyaunke aapasi rishton se iskaa koi sambandh nahin dekha gaya

 moose ke anusaar, ye nishkarsh yuva yaa bujurg jodon, nae-nae shaadishuda yaa phir jinaki shaadi dashakon pehle hui ho, sab par samaan rup se lagu hote hai
 The purpose of this research is not that couples start having more or less sex once a week to reach the average of sex, but they should talk to their partner about whether they are able to meet their sexual needs or not
 apane saathi ke saath antarang sambandh banaae rakhana jaruri he na ki zyada se zyada sex karnaa

 Actor Ranbir Kapoor danced with Madhuri Dixit to a song in the film 'yeh Jawani Hai Deewani' and he is heavily influenced by her
 tippaniyan 30-year-old Ranbir said, Madhuri is great and i am happy that i got an opportunity to dance with her
 vah behad pratibhavan, mehnatee hai tathaa hameshaa samay par aati thim
 Directed by Ayan Mukerji's film 'yeh Jawani Hai Deewani' will be released on May 31 and features Ranbir's heroine Deepika Padukone

 She is very talented, hardworking and always came on time

 loktantr kii sabase badi samasya he ki isamen janata ko jeetna padataa he
 This victory actually translates into votes
 lekin haal ke varshon main sidhe vot paane kii jugat main rajaneta girte ja rahe hai
 Now he has no example
 iskaa sabase taaja udhaaharan tamilnadu kii mukhyamantri jayalalita ne diya
 In an attempt to take advantage of the Supreme Court's decision, he even announced the release of Rajiv Gandhi's killers from jail
 supreme court ne rajeev gandhi ke hatyaron kii mrityudand kii sajaa ko umr kaid main badal kya diya, jayalalita ne sasti lokapriyata paane ke liye aanan-fanan main yah mahatvapurn ghoshnaa kar di
 It was clear that he felt that Karunanidhi should not win the game in this matter
 karunanidhi altitii ke samarthak maane jate hai or is maamle ko tool dekar unhone upie sarkaar kii videsh niti ko baari dhakka pahunchaaya tha
 The politics of Tamil Nadu is driven by emotions and words like development do not matter very much the same way as in Bengal
 hatyare to hatyare hote hai or in hatyaron ne rajeev gandhi hi nahin kul 26 logon kii jaan le lee
 Jayalalithaa was not ashamed to announce the immediate release of those who killed so many people from jail

 His actions have fallen so much that he is ashamed to see them
 jis loktantr ke vot kii khatir ve yah naatak kar rahe hai unhen uski maryaada tak kaa khyaal nahin he
 It is not that vote politics is anything new in India
 yah to varshon se kii ja rahi he or iskaa dushprinaam hamen kai baar jhelana padaa
 There are many examples of politicians falling for votes, but looking at the elections, leaders of every level are taking poor steps one by one
 har rajya se nakaaratmak khabaren aa rahi hai
 There seems to be no room left for honesty and honesty in politics
 ab to janata ko hi iskaa samaadhaan dhundhana hoga taaki loktantr kii neenv khokhli na ho jaae
 Elections are coming and the public should understand the motives of politicians and vote only then this democracy will be saved

 Lashing out at Shri Shree, he said that NGO runes cannot do anything in this matter

 We are ready for this
 masjid yaa to ayodhya se 15 kilometre dur shahanva main ban sakati he or yaa phir lakhanu ke shiya bahul kshetra main ban sakati he

 In Bihar, the conflict between RJD and JDU is increasing over the resignation of Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Yadav
 ek taraf jahaan jediu ne sthiti spasht kar di he ki nitish kumaar ko bhrashtachar ke aaropon se ghire tejasvi yadav ke istife se kam kuch bhi manjuur nahin, vahiin duusari ore argedy ne bhi saaf kar diya he ki tejasvi kisi bhi keemat par istipha nahin denge
 In the midst of this confrontation, Bhai Virendra, MLA from rjd's Maner, also threatened to withdraw support from Nitish government in gestures
 patrakaron se baatcheet karte hue bhai virendra ne kaha, 'yah baat nahin bhulani chahie ki argedy ke paas 80 vidhayak hai or mahagathbandhan main vahi hoga jo vah chahenge
 On the question of breaking the JDU and forming a government, the RJD MLA said, "we believe in democracy
" ham jediu ke kisi vidhayak ko todane kii koshish nahin kar rahe
 On the other hand, for giving 4 days extension to Tejashwi Yadav on behalf of Nitish Kumar, brother Birendra said that RJD does not do any work on the advice of any person
 bhai virendra ne kaha ki argedy ke saare vidhayak ekajute hokar tejasvi ke peeche khadi he or kisi bhi keemat par tejasvi apane pad se istipha nahin dene vaale hai

 Terming all the allegations as false, Tejashwi Yadav called it a conspiracy of PM Modi and Amit Shah
 tejasvi ne kaha ki 28 saal ke ek yuva se dar gai he bijepi isliye fansaane kii sajeesh ho rahi he
 Tejashwi said that he did not make any mistake and would give a befitting reply to the BJP

 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar may choose to distance himself from Narendra Modi, but Narendra Modi's party BJP is going to do him tremendous damage in Bihar
 nilsan dwaara ek news channel ke liye kiye gaye survey main bataaya gaya he ki bihar kii 40 main se 19 siten bijepi kii jholii main ja rahi hai, jabaki 2 siten uski sahyogi algepi bhi jeet sakati he
 Significantly, in the last general election held in 2009, BJP had 11 seats here, when JDU and BJP contested together
 lekin bijepi ke liye chintaa kii baat yah he ki isi channel ke pichley survey main bijepi ko zyada siten hasil hone kaa anumaan lagaaya gaya tha
 In the survey conducted in January, BJP was projected to get 24 seats and in February survey the party got 21 seats
 taaja survey chintaa kaa vishay isliye bhi he ki har survey main bijepi kaa aankada neeche kii ore aa rahaa he or aam chunaav sir par hai
 Lalu Prasad Yadav's party, which won just four seats in the 2009 general election, can win 10 seats in RJD 2014
 lalu ke liye khushi kii baat yah he ki pichley survey main unki party ko sirf 5 siten milane kaa anumaan tha
 The most worrying thing in this survey is for JDU because JDU, which contested with BJP in 2009, got 20 seats, whereas in 2014 it is expected to get only 6 seats
 bijepi se alag hue nitish kumaar se yahaan kii janata khush nahin dikh rahi he, farvari main kiye gaye pichley survey main unki party ko 9 siten milane kaa anumaan tha
 The Congress may get 2–2 seats to the Lok Janshakti Party
 algepi ke liye ye khushi kii baat he kyonki pichley chunaav main unhen ek bhi seat hasil nahin hui thi, jabaki congress is survey se niraash hogi
 The Congress had got 5 seats in the last election of 2009
 gathbandhan ke rup main congress-argedy ko kul 26 pratishat vot milane kaa anumaan he, jiske anusaar unhen 12 siten mil sakati hai, jabaki bijepi-algepi gathbandhan ko 38 pratishat vot milane kaa anumaan lagaaya gaya he, jisaki chholi main 21 siten ja sakati hai
 In this survey, JDU is projected to get only 12 percent of the vote, which if converted into seats, it can win 6 seats
 anya ko 24 pratishat mat milane kaa anumaan he or unki jholii 1 seat aa sakati he

 On the eve of the first phase of polling in Bihar assembly elections, the sting video of corruption of two Nitish Kumar government ministers, former RJD health minister and some other ministers are also likely to affect the voting percentage and results

 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley also had to speak after the failure of the plan to bring back black money from abroad despite a stringent law that provided for violators of the law, including imprisonment of 10 years besides imprisonment of 300 years and confiscation of their property in India
 The real source of black money is not abroad, but in the country itself

 68 crore voters will elect mlas for 243 seats, where the maximum spending limit for the candidates is only 28 lakh rupees, but in Sting's video, the sacked minister of Bihar is telling that he has to spend at least two crores to win the election
 But it is true of all the candidates of both alliances

 The sting of corrupt leaders on the eve of the first phase of polling is not the beginning of the purification of politics, but a five-year harvest in electoral politics
 haryana main robert wadra, rajasthan main lalit modi, maharashtra main chagan bhujabal ke bhrashtachar ke viruddh bijepi ne vot maange, lekin sarkaar banane ke baad aaj tak koi prabhavi karrwai nahin hui or mafia afasar yadav singh ko bihar ke chunaav kii raajnneeti kii vajah se abhi tak giraftaar hi nahin kiya gaya
 According to the ADR estimates, about one-third of the candidates in Bihar's current elections are from criminal and mafia backgrounds, which will certainly be effective in future government as well

 The name of the donors in the statement of income (less than two-thirds of the total revenue) by all political parties, including BJP, despite the finance ministry's move to mandate widespread use of PAN numbers for the prevention of black money And PAN details are never given

 With the move of 'shero' fantasy in Bollywood, now there is such a problem with the famous heroines which can become a big problem in the future
 badi heroine ke saath bade hero kaam karne se ghabaraate najar aa rahe hai yaa phir kai or kaarnon se ve unke saath screenspes share karne se kanni kaat rahe hai yaa phir ye hiroine hi apane liye zyada screenspes chaahati hai
 For some time i got to see Priyanka Chopra, and there were reports that no actor is willing to work with her
 beshak, aisa in heroine ke mahila pradhan filmein karne kii vajah se ho yaa phir bollywood main unke liye alag se majboot role likhane jane se yaa bollywood se lekar hollywood tak main badhate rutabe jaisi kai baaten hai jo anbhavi hero ko in heroine se dur rakhane kaa kaam kar rahi hai
 Or are these heroines doing such a role or demand that they do not need a famous hero
 aaie baat karte hai kuch aisi hi heroine ke bare main:priyanka chopra, 32 varshain dinon ve bollywood se zyada hollywood main active hai
 Season 2 of his TV series 'quantico' has started and he is busy shooting for it
 ve 'bewaach' film main bhi kaam kar rahi hai
 He can be seen performing big acts from time to time on the big international stage
 is tarah unka kad kaaphi bada ho chukaa he, or aise main bollywood ke diggaj sitare unke saath kaam karne kaa jokhim uthaanaa shaayad nahin chahenge
 Then his last few films like 'jai Gangajal' and 'mary Kaum' were heroine-oriented films
 is tarah jab tak unki guddi hollywood main akaash chuum rahi he, unhen bollywood kii zyada chintaa nahin kerani chahie, phir unhone produsar banakar apane bhavishya ko surakshit karne kii disha main bhi kadam badha liya he
 Vidya Balan, 38 years old Balan is the heroine who established the imagination of 'shero' in Bollywood
 unka to record hi rahaa he ki jis film main vah bin hero ke rahi hai, usne box offis par tahalaka machaaya he
 Then whether it is a story or a dirty picture
 ab unki aane filmein 'kahani-2', 'begum jaan' or 'kavyitri kamaladas' kii byopic bhi kuch aisi hai
 Whenever she tried to work with a hero or try something new, she could not spread her power
 phir chaahe vah film 'teen' ho, 'ghanchakkar' yaa phir 'hamaari adhuri kahani'
 Now she has embraced her destiny, so her focus has shifted to biopic and female-oriented films
 kangana ranot, 29 varshavah apane bindaasapan or kirdaaron ko lekar alag pasand kii vajah se bollywood main khaas pahchaan rakhti hai, or yahi vajah he ki ve teen baar rashtriya puraskaar (fishan (2008) ke liye best suporting actress
 Queen (2014) and Best Actress for Tanu Weds Manu Returns (2015) have also won
 is tarah kii uplabdhiyon vaali heroin ke saath kaam karte samay hero ke to paseene chhutenge hi
 Then whenever he has tried to do something different together with the hero, he has to face it
 jaise 'katti batti'
 Kanganaki is his role solid in upcoming films 'simran' and 'rangoon'
 aishwarya raay bachchan, 42 varshbachchan parivaar kii bahu ne 2015 main 'jajba' ke saath bollywood main vaapasi kii thi
 The film was female-oriented
 haalanki unka saath dene ke liye irfan the lekin vah bhi kairactor role main the, or film kii puri kaman aishwarya ke haathon me hi thi
 Then he performed 'sarabjeet'
 isamen bhi kahani sarbajit kii hi thi, lekin puri film 'sarbajit' kii bahan par hi kendrit thi or aishwarya raay ne yah role nibhaayaa tha
 She is now seen opposite Ranbir Kapoor in 'ae Dil Hai Mushkil', and she is seen saying, 'I don't want to be wanted by anyone
 
 
 " or vah ranbir ke saath bold andaaj main hai
 In this way their character can be understood
 is tarah vah ke kirdaaron ke jariye vah khud ko sthapit karnaa chaahati hai, or is tarah ke role main unke saamne duusare hero nahin aana chahenge
 Deepika Padukone, 30 years oldhalankideepika Padukonki is in high demand in Bollywood and she is also working with Vin Diesel in Hollywood
 lekin pichhali kuch film jaise 'piku', 'bajirao mastaani' is baat kaa ishaara kar detii hai ki deepika role ke maamle main hero par baari padati najar aa rahi hai
 She is choosing such roles, in which she is not short in any way
 unki aane vaali film 'padmavati' me bhi vahi lead role main hai
 Many people came up with the name for this film, but there were also reports that the selection of Starcast was interfered with Mendipika
 phir yah baat bhi nahin bhoolanaa chahie ki vah apane dost ranvir singh ke saath hi adhiktar filmein kar rahi hai
 Taimur Ali Khan, son of Bollywood actors Saif Ali Khan and Kareena Kapoor Khan, remains a social media sensation
 unki tasviren soshal media par khub viral hoti hai
 When they go out to play Timur games or outings with their parents, they get full attention of their fans
 haalanki haal hi main taimur kisi game ke chalate nahin balki apni tishart ke chalate surkhiyon main rahe
 In fact, during the Lok Sabha elections in Mumbai, a picture of Timur Ali Khan became increasingly viral on social media
 tasviir us vakt lee gai thi jab karina kapur khan apane bete taimur ke saath matdaan karne nikali thim
 Taimur wore orange t-shirt and green shorts that day
 lekin viral ho rahi tasviir main jo cheez sabase zyada gaur karne vaali thi, wo thi unki tishart par bana graphics

 to kya taimur ali khan us roj piem narendra modi or bhartiya janata party kaa samarthan karne nikle the? jawaab he- nahin
 This photo was actually photoshopped

 Actually, some other graphics have been made on Taimur's t-shirt
 yani jaahir si baat he ki kisi ne bhaajapa ke samarthan main maahaul banane ke uddeshy se yaa majaak karne ke liye taimur kii tasviir ko photoshop kiya or tishart par namo agen likh diya

 West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has called for a thorough investigation into the Punjab National Bank (PNB) scam
 mamata banerjee ne guuruuvaar ko saath hi narendra modi sarkaar ko chetaya ki aam aadmi ke bachat ke paise kii suraksha sunishchit karne ke liye unki party bada andolan karne se bhi nahin chukegi
 Mamta Banerjee wrote in tweet- 'see what happened in Punjab National Bank? Scam larger than Rs 11,000
 logon kii bachat bhi surakshit nahin he
 It should be widely investigated
 ’look what happened at Punjab National Bank ? a scam of more than Rs 11,000 crore
 People's savings are not safe
 There must be a thorough, time bound enquiry— Mamata Banerjee (@mamataofficial)february 15, 2018pienbi saarvajanik kshetra ke bainkon main desh kaa doosraa sabase bada bank he
 The recent disclosure of fake transactions worth Rs 11,000 crore in a branch of PNB in mumbai has created a stir
 is maamle main sibiai jaanch shuru ho chuki he
 Addressing a public meeting in Jhargram, Mamata Banerjee said, 'today people are apprehensive
 dekhie mumbai main punjab neshnal bank main kya hua
 11,000 crore rupees scam! All that money belongs to the common man
 koun is paise ko le gaya? koun ise kha gaya
 Mamta said, "those who stole money will run away, but how will the money of the common man come back?" Such corruption should be investigated
 ’ mamata ne chetavanee ke lahaze main kaha ki trinmul congress tab takkendre sarkaar kaa peechha nahin chhodeegijab tak logon kaa paisa surakshit nahin ho jaataa
 Opposing the proposed FDRI bill, Mamta accused the central government of dodging the money saved by the hard work of the poor
 mamata ne kaha, ‘haal main unhone epadiarai bill laane kii baat kahi
 i have written a letter against it
 kyon likhi he? kyonki ye bill kahata he ki log apni bachat ke paise ko jab chahen, nahin nikaal sakate
 We have asked for the withdrawal of this bill
 maine iske liye vitt mantri ko chitthee bhi likhi lekin unhone jawaab dena bhi jaruri nahin samajha
 According to Mamta, she has again written a letter to the Center on Thursday to express her opposition
 kalakaar ko kiske saath hona chahie- vichaar ke saath, vyakti ke saath yaa kala ke saath? use apane upar pad rahe tamaam dabaavon se kaise nikalnaa chahie? ek kalakaar ke bheetar koun se sangharsh chalate rahete hai jisase uski kala prabhavit hoti he? kala ko rokane vaali koun si bandishen he or unase kaise paar paanaa he? aise kuch sawaalon par gayan kala ke madhyam se natya prastuti‘bandish 20 se 20,000 hertz’ apana najariya prastut karti he
 In the presentation, the changes and changes in Hindustani music in the last century and a half, questions of the status of artists and internal politics and restlessness emerge very subtly
 prastuti main ateet ke saath samakaleenta kii bhi maheen bunai he
 'adyam' has been bringing better theater in the past few years
 yah saal is silsile kaa teesraa saal he or purva naresh nirdeshit ‘bandish 20 se 20,000 hertz’ dilli main hone vaali is saal kii pehali prastuti he
 Previously, Purva Naresh has given a performance titled 'ladies Sangeet' with 'adyam'
 nautanki gayika champa bai or baithak gayika benny apane ateet ko yaad karti hai or yaaden saajha karte hai do aaj ke jamaane ke gayak
 From the singers' time differences and their positioning, the play's narrative takes shape in dialogue between the past and the present
 aazaadee ke sattar saalon kaa jashn he
 Champabai and Benibai are to be honored
 In this ceremony, these two singers of today have to sing
 in sabake saath hai baiyon kaa shagird munnu jo unke jivan kii hissaa he, unke manager se lekar venity bain tak
 Champabai wants to sing in this ceremony but her image of the gimmick singer is not compatible with the 'dignity' of the ceremony
 benny shastreey gayika hai unako sab sunanaa chaahate hai lekin vah gaanaa chhod chuki hai
 Mausami cannot sing as she relies on electronic frills instead of vocal vocal instrument vocal cords
 kabir gaanaa chahta he lekin isliye nahin ga saktaa kyonki padosi desh main uskaa gaanaa hit ho gaya he
 The popularity gained in the neighboring country has made him a target of trolls
 aayojak ko laabh uske nahin gane main he, uskaa gaanaa ‘rashtrahit’ main nahin he
 It has been declared 'antinational'
 in sabake bich he sarkari babu, jo keval aadesh ke hisaab se apana anukulan karata rahata he or adatan pareshaan he, kiske saamne jhukna he or kahaan kab akadana he, ke buniyadi gyaan se las
 Amidst all this, Munnu's question is that Fasadi is at work, Babu is at work, where are the artists? prastuti main hindustani sangeet kii aitihaasik yatra saamne aati he jisamen benibai jaisi gayika ko bedakhal kiya gaya he, champabai lokapriy hone or sur par pakad hone ke baavjood benny or samaaj ke liye hey hai, maamuli hai
 Several levels and dimensions of their exploitation emerge in the presentation
 kritrim upkarnon ke sahare gaate aajkal ke gayak kabir or mausami hai jo apni chhavi kaa istemaal karnaa or apane ko bechnaa jaanate hai
 Their methods do not understand the old age and the old ways do not suit them
 inkaa ateet katu he, vartmaan chamakdaar, jabaki benny, champa or munnu ke liye vartmaan main kuch he hi nahin
 But there is a fear within everyone whose color is different
 benny ko apmaan kaa dar he, champa ko gumnami kaa, munnu ko bhukh kaa
 The image of Kabir and the seasonal identity of the old
 in sabake saath is naatak main jo adrishy he, vah he samaaj or satta, jo nirantar inke upar haaavee he, alag-alag roopon main
 Sometimes in the form of English law, sometimes in the form of high values for nation building after independence, sometimes in the form of social media trolls
 in bandishon kaa ilaaj kya he? The play tells - commitment to his art
 isliye gane kaa kaarykram cancel hone baavjood prastuti kii samaapti main bandish todakar gaate hai
 Resistance has to be devised differently in every round
 tippaniyan The presentation hypothesis presents the story in an entertaining manner with seriousness no less
 kahani kehete hue manch parfarming spes or baiyon kii baithak main taralata se badalata he
 Changes in time and space have been introduced with slight changes in the rise and fall of the curtains and visual decor
 prakaash sangyojan saadhaaran he
 Music is important in the presentation Shubha Mudgal's music makes the play more audible
 abhinaytaon kii gayaki ke saath sanvaadon kaa chutilaapan or timming kamaal he
 Actors Anubha Fatehpuria, Nivedita Bhargava, Ipshita, Danish Hussain, Harsh Khurana, Hitesh have handled the task of balancing tension, humor and dialogue
 purva naresh ne apni pichhali prastutiyon se sabit kiya he ki total theatre unki rangabhasha he or isamen vibhinn tatwon ke santulit mishran main ve kushal hai
 There is also communicability in his presentation and depth in the narrative
 abhinayta par bharosa karte hue sangeet kaa istemaal karnaa unhen bakhubi aata he
 The length of the presentation and eventually becoming didactic is the weakness of the presentation which has the scope to be removed
 ‘aadyam’ pichley kuch saalon se behatar rangakarm darshakon ke saamne lekar aa rahaa he
 This year is the third year of this sequence and 'bandish 20 to 20,000 Hz' directed by Purva Naresh is the first presentation of this year in Delhi
 isse pehle bhi purva naresh ‘aadyam’ ke saath ‘ledis sangeet’ naam se ek prastuti de chuki hai
 Nautanki singer Champa Bai and meeting singer Beni remember their past and share memories of two present-day singers
 gayakon ke samay ke antar or unki pojishning se naatak kaa kathy ateet or vartmaan ke samvaad main aakaar letaa he
 It is a celebration of seventy years of independence
 champabai or benibai kaa sammaan hona he is samaaroh main in do aaj ke gayakon ko gaanaa he
 Along with all this is the disciple of Biu Munnu who is a part of his life, from his manager to the vanity ban
 is samaaroh main champabai gaanaa chaahati hai lekin nautanki gayika kii uski chhavi samaaroh kii ‘garima’ ke anukool nahin he
 Beni is a classical singer who wants to hear them all but she has left the song
 mausami nahin ga sakati kyonki vah gayaki ke mul upkaran vocal cord kii jagah electronic tamzam par nirbhar he
 Kabir wants to sing but cannot sing because his song has become a hit in the neighboring country
 padosi desh main arjeet lokapriyata ne use trols ke nishane par laa diya he
 The benefit of the organizer is not in his song, his song is not in 'rashtrahit'
 vah ‘antinational’ ghoshit kar diya gaya he
 In the midst of all this is Sarkar Babu, who keeps adapting only according to the order and is habitually disturbed, equipped with basic knowledge of whom to bow down and where to stick
 in sabake bich munnu kaa sawaal he ki fasaadi apane kaam par hai, babu apane kaam par hai, aise main kalakaar kahaan hai? The presentation reveals a historical journey of Hindustani music in which a singer like Benibai is evicted, Champabai is modest for Beni and society, despite being popular and holding on to the tune
 inke shoshan ke kai str or aayam prastuti main ubharate hai
 The singers nowadays sing with the help of artificial instruments are Kabir and Moushumi who know how to use their image and sell themselves
 inke tareeke puraane jamaane ko samaj nahin aate or puraane tareeke inako nahin suhate
 Their past is bitter, the present shiny, while there is nothing in the present for Beni, Champa and Munnu
 lekin sabake bheetar ek dar he jiskaa rang alag-alag he
 Beni fears humiliation, Champa's oblivion, Munnu's hunger
 kabir ko image kaa or mausami ko puraani pahchaan kaa
 Along with all this, what is invisible in this drama is society and power, which continues to dominate them in different forms
 kabhi angreji kanoon ke rup main, kabhi aazaadee ke baad raashtra nirmaan ke liye ucch mulyon ke rup main to kabhi soshal media ke trols ke rup main
 What is the treatment of these restrictions? naatak bataata he - apni kala ke prati patibaddhta
 Therefore, despite the cancellation of the song, they break and sing at the end of the performance
 har daur main pratirodh ko bhinn tarika izad karnaa hi padataa he
 The comments prastuti kii pariklpana kathy ko manoranjak andaaj main pesh karti he jisamen gambhirtha kahin kam nahin he
 Telling the story the stage changes fluidly in the performing space and the meeting of the left
 samay or spes ke badlaav ko pardon ke uthne-girane or drishy sajja ke maamuli badlaavon ke saath upasthit kar diya gaya he
 The light combination is simple
 prastuti main sangeet ahm he shubha mudgal kaa sangeet naatak ko adhik shravy banaata he
 The finesse and timing of the dialogues with the actors' vocals is amazing
 tanaav, hasya or vimarsh kaa santulan banane kaa jimmaa abhinaytaon anubha fatehpuria, nivedita bhargav, ipshita, danish hossain, harsh khurana, hitesh ne bakhubi sambhala he
 Purva Naresh has proved from his previous productions that Total Theater is his color language and he is proficient in balanced mixing of various elements
 unki prastuti main sampreshniyata bhi he or kathy main gaharaai bhi
 He enjoys using music to rely on the actor
 prastuti kii lambaai or ant main upadeshaatmak ho janaa prastuti kii kamajori he jise dur kiye jane kii gunjaaish he
 The presentation hypothesis presents the story in an entertaining manner with seriousness no less
 kahani kehete hue manch parfarming spes or baiyon kii baithak main taralata se badalata he
 Changes in time and space have been introduced with slight changes in the rise and fall of the curtains and visual decor
 prakaash sangyojan saadhaaran he
 Music is important in the presentation Shubha Mudgal's music makes the play more audible
 abhinaytaon kii gayaki ke saath sanvaadon kaa chutilaapan or timming kamaal he

 purva naresh ne apni pichhali prastutiyon se sabit kiya he ki total theatre unki rangabhasha he or isamen vibhinn tatwon ke santulit mishran main ve kushal hai
 There is also communicability in his presentation and depth in the narrative
 abhinayta par bharosa karte hue sangeet kaa istemaal karnaa unhen bakhubi aata he

 com / sacso5pu1f— Cricket South Africa (@officialcsa) April 18, 2019 Du Plessis said, 'in all the previous World Cups we wanted to do something like Superman, we were trying to do something special and could not do what was needed
 
 ’unhone kaha,‘ham baar vah sahi nahin hota
 We could not do our best in the World Cup and put a lot of pressure on ourselves
 ham sirf cricket par focus karnaa chaahate hai
 Du Plessis, who is going to play the third World Cup, said that mental preparation is very important for the tournament
 unhone kaha ,‘yahi vajah he ki ham chaahate hai ki team khulkar khele
 He is not afraid of defeat
 hamen match ke din sarvshereshth pradarshan karnaa hoga or har khilaadi ko apni takat kaa ahsaas hona chahie
 ' kitaab: main or meraa pakistan (hindi)lekhak: imran khanprakaashak: orient publishingdamah 425 rupecovar: hardkvarduniya ke sabase bade loktantr main imran khan kii pahchaan ek cricketer ke taur par he
 a young child who knows the pace of fast bowling also talks about Imran Khan
 lekin imran khan jab bachapan ke dinon main cricket khelte the, to unki khwaahish jananath main cricket khilne kii thi
 He often asked the elders of the family the question, 'will i be able to play cricket in paradise, will i be able to fire a gun there
 ’ jananath main khilne or bandook chalaane kii baat uljhan paidaa karti he or imran kii raajnneeti bhi
 This is the first picture of the life of Imran Khan, who came out of the cricket field and entered politics from the corridor of the hospital
 imran kii kalpana main ek aisa loktantr he jisaki buniyaad islam par tiki he
 Or a democracy that has the flag of Islam at its fingertips
 lekin imran apane is islamic loktantr ko paribhaashit kar paane main asafal najar aate hai
 Islam and democracy are two different things
 islam jahaan paigambar kii baat karata he
 At the same time, people are important in democracy
 unke chunaav, apni baat rakhane kii aazaadee, aalochana or apane tareeke se jeene kii marji
 People want to wear, dress according to their own
 jabaki islam kahata he ki aap tayshuda tareeke se jivan jien
 In such a situation, Imran's concept of Islamic democracy is not understood
 shaayad pakistan ke langade loktantr ke peeche ek bada kaaran yah bhi he kyonki imran se pehle pakistani shaskaon ne islamic loktantr ke khvabgah ko jameen par utaarne kii koshish kai baar kii
 After knowing the present situation of Pakistan, the reality of Islamic democracy starts to be understood
 imran apane desh kii raajnneeti ke bigade swaroop ko sudhaarney kaa makasad rakhte hai
 Imran himself recounts his own story of yesterday in the translated version of 'pakistan: a Personal History', the story of the life of a great cricketer written in English, originally written in English
 246 pannon kii is puri kahani main imran apni islamic pahchaan or aadhyatmik sansar ke chakkar katate rahete he isse ek doharaav paidaa hota he or aakhir tak chalata he
 However, some such characters keep coming in between
 jo bhavishya main hone vaali ghatnaon kii kunjee imran ko saunpte rahete he
 Imran is known as a pro-taliban in Pakistan
 haalanki iske liye vah pakistan kii angreji media ko jimmedaar tehraate he
 The process of dialogue between the Sharif government and the Taliban has started in recent times
 uski vakaalat imran ek lambey samay se karte rahe hai
 When writing the history of himself and his country, when Imran tells about the Taliban and Al Qaeda, the choice of his words makes it clear that Imran has an inclination towards the Taliban
 soviet sangh ke khilaaf kabatoli ladaakon ko america dwaara prashikshan diya janaa or phir dashak bhar baad inhen ladaakon ko duniya ke liye khatarnaak bataate hue yuddh ched dena yaa phir 9 / 11 ke baad puri daniya main musalamaanon ke khilaaf america ke yuddh chhedane kii apratyaksh muhim kaa imran ne khuli mukhaalafat kii he
 Apart from this, Imran owes Pakistan's knee to the imperialist policies of America
 yah puraa adhyay pathak ko baandh ke rakhata he
 Alliances of power with 3A The political party Tehreekay Insaaf, formed in 1996, had to face many problems
 jiske centre main imran rahe
 The party did not get any seat in the 1997 elections, while in 2002 it got one seat
 haalanki tab se lekar aaj 12 baras ho chuke he or bahut saare pakistani taharike insaaf ko ek vikalp ke taur par dekh rahe hai
 There is a saying in Imran Pakistan that only one can rule in Pakistan with 3A i
e
 Allah, Army and America
 pakistan ke logon ko raajnneetik vikalp dene ke liye prayasarat imran ke saath allaah to hai lekin army or america nahin
 The role of the army in the democracy that Imran is dreaming of is on the border
 to duusari ore vah america ke khilaaf khadey najar aate hai
 It is a different matter that when they talk about their democracy, they talk about Western institutions and their secularism
 vahiin, lage haath apni paramparaon or saamaajik dhaanche ko sarvshereshth bataate hue pashchimi jivan style kii aalochana karte he
 Before the US, the army stands in the way of the success of tehreek-e-insaf and Imran will have to devise a new strategy to break his partnership with the chair
 taaki janata kaa bharosa jeeta ja sake
 From the perspective of a partnership with Jemima, Imran's desire to know about his personal life hits him the most
 apane jamaane ke diggaj cricketer ne apni patni jemima khan ke bare main ek adhyay likhaa he
 But it is very brief
 isamen kuch bhi nayaa nahin he
 The reader is interested in going deeper into the relationship of the two
 lekin nijee jindagi kii pich par imran apana wicket badi chaturaai se bachaa le jate hai
 He says that his partnership with Jemima was very well-settled
 jindagi ke shuruuaati saal pashchim main gujaarne vaale imran khan vahaan kii raajnneetik vyavastha se prabhavit to najar aate hai
 But after he retires from cricket, as he starts living in Pakistan, there is an ego of eminence over Islam, tribal values and styles which he justifies
 haalanki duniya bhar main ek cheez dekhne main aati he ki agar vyakti apni samskruti or mulyon ke prati dridhta kaa bhav rakhata he to use apane hi desh main dakshinpanthi qaraar de diya jaataa he
 This could also be one of the reasons behind Pakistan's introduction of Imran as pro-taliban by the English media
 apane desh kii aazaadee ke paanch baras baad paidaa hue imran kii kahani darasal ek ke baad doosraa lakshya hasil karne kii gaatha he
 From whom inspiration can be drawn
 cricket main ek mukaam hasil karne ke baad apni maa kii yaad main imran ne cancer aspataal banavaane ke liye jis tarah kaa jujharupan dikhaaya he vah prerit karata he
 Making donations from slum-dwellers for the hospital, returning after being injured in the crucial phase of a career inspires the charismatic leadership that made the World Cup a winning team a winner
 tamaam pareshaaniyon se ladate hue apane desh kaa pehla cancer aspataal banvaanaa phir ek skool or uske baad peshawar or karachi main do aspataal banavaane kaa lakshya
 
 ye bataane ke liye kaaphi he ki imran ne apni jindagi main kya hasil kiya he
 Romance with politics Imran's romance with politics has become interesting
 navaj sharif, benazir bhutto ke bare main choti choti jaankariyaan baandh ke rakhti hai
 The story of Nawaz Sharif's removal from Imran to captaincy and opening himself on the West Indies tour is interesting
 duniya ke dhakad gendbaajon kaa saamana karne ke liye jab mudassar nazar pad, thai, saporter, helmet or tamaam suraksha ke upayon se las the
 Nawaz was eager to face the Caribbean attack in pad and cap
 idhar, dressing room main imran is chintaa main duube hue the ki ambulance taiyaar yaa nahin
 'I and my Pakistan' presents a complete picture of the leader of the tehreek-e-insaaf against the Imran whom the readers know
 kisi anya bhashaa se anuvaadit kitabon main pruf kii galtiyaan ab aam baat ho gai hai
 This book is also no exception
 zyaadaatar vaakyon main kii jagah ‘kari’ likhaa gaya he
 Which spoils the reader's taste
 aabhushan udyog ‘mandi' ke daur se guzar rahaa he
 This can create employment crisis in front of skilled artisans
 akhil bhartiya ratna evam aabhushan gharelu parishad ne somvaar ko yah baat kahi
 The council has also sought to reduce the customs duty on imported gold and reduce the GST rate on jewelery
 aam bajet 2019-20 main aaayaatit sone par seemaa shulk 10 pratishat se badhaakar 12
 5 percent was done
 vahiin aabhushan par maal evam seva kar (jiesti) kii dar teen pratishat tay kii gai he
 In the erstwhile Value Added Tax (VAT) system, it was one percent
 parishad ke vaais chairman shankar sen ne kaha, ‘kamjor maang se aabhushan udyog mandi ke daur se guzar rahaa he
 This has led to the possibility of snatching the employment of thousands of skilled artisans
 'unhone kaha ki seemaa shulk main vruddhi tathaa jiesti kii maujuuda dar se upabhokta dharna prabhavit ho rahi he kyonki isse aabhushanon kii keemton main ijapha hua he
 Sen told the media, 'our demand is that the rate of customs duty should be 12
 5 pratishat se ghataakar 10 pratishat kiya jaae
 The GST rate should also be brought to one percent
 ' unhone kaha ki oonche seemaa shulk kii vajah se sone kii taskari bhi badi he

 us samay raav cabinet main rajyamantri rahe salmaan khurshid ne apni pustak ‘‘visibil muslim, invincibal citijan: anderstanding islam in indian demokrasi'' main is baat kaa zikr kiya he
 Communal riots occurred in many parts of the country soon after the mosque collapsed
 khurshid ne pustak main kaha he ki masjid dhahne se kanoon vyavastha par sawalia nishaan lag gaya tha
 Khurshid recalled, "on the night of December 6, i went to Rajesh Pilot to request some action as the crowd continued to grow around the venue
 vah is baat par sahamat hue ki agar kuch kanishtha mantri pradhanmantri ko taiyaar karen to vah faijabad jaaenge
 "he wrote in the book," i (CK) went to Jafar Sharif to call the Prime Minister
 unhone kol kiya or pradhanmantri ne unase kaha ki ham pradhan sachiv een verma yaa grih sachiv ke sampark main rahen jinke sheeghra hi uttar pradesh pahunchane kii sambhaavna thi
 "verma asked some questions and it was not clear whether he could go on tour immediately

 Subhash Yadav, who hails from Jamtara district in Jharkhand, is a teacher and has to attend a school in Nirsa in Dhanbad district
 lekin jis duuri ko 20 kimi main tay kiya ja saktaa tha uske liye inhen motorcycle se kareeb 60 kilometre kaa chakkar lagaana hota he
 The reason is a half-bridge over the Barakar River
 yah pul virgaanv or birbendiya ke bich ban rahaa tha
 In fact, whatever the claims of development of the Bharatiya Janata Party government in Jharkhand, but it seems difficult to put those promises on the ground into reality
 isaki misaal he jamtada ko dhanbad se jodne vaale pul ke nirmaan ko lekar
 a decade has passed since this project started but the bridge is not built

 However, after the construction of about 75 kilometers, four bridges of the bridge were washed away in the rainy season in the year 2008
 pilron ke bahane ke baad se pul kaa nirmaan kaary tham gaya
 In the ten years after 2008, how much water flowed into the Barakar River, but the construction of the bridge could not be started
 rajya sarkaar kabhi kahati he ki baaki bache pul ko todakar dobaaraa banaaya jayega, kabhi iske bache hisse ko puraa karaane ke vaade kiye jate hai lekin adhuraa pul apni kismat ko ro rahaa he
 Thousands of people like Subhash Yadav are facing difficulties in going towards Dhanbad
 unhen dhanbad yaa nirsa jane ke liye pehle bengal kii sarhad main mathan hote hue janaa padataa he or 60 kilometre lanbaa rasta tay karnaa hota he
 While this bridge would have been built, this distance would have been just 20 kilometers
 is nadi ko paar karne ke liye naav se avaagaman karnaa hota he, jo baraakar nadi ke bahaav ke hisaab se behad khatarnaak he
 Still people have to travel without risking their lives
 gauratlab he ki sarkaar ne kai baar aashwaasan diya he ki dedh kilometre lanbaa yah pul dobaaraa banaaya jayega or is par 20 karod ru
 Will cost vaise, is ilaake main pichley 25 saal se log naav kaa hi safar karne ke liye majaboor he
 Ten years ago, when the construction of the bridge started, people expected to reduce travel time
 lekin ab tamaam vaadon ke baavjood pul nirmaan main koi kadam nahin badhaayaa gaya he
 With the people living in this area, this bridge is also waiting for the state government to lose sleep in order to build its fortunes

 Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Shaharyar Khan has made it clear that the PCB will no longer ask India to play the proposed series in the UAE in December
 shehryaarane kaha, ‘mujhe lagata he ki ham is siries ke bare main bahut kuch kah chuke hai or ab ham usne or nahin kahenge
 The ball is now in their court and they have to decide and tell us about the future of this series
 ’ aagaamisirisor bharat ke saath sambandh ke bare main abhi tak apane sabase talkh bayaan main is purv rajanyik ne kaha kipisibisiris khilne or dwipaksheeya cricket behaal karne ko lekar apni dilchaspee jaahir kar chukaa he
 He said, 'I don't want to say anything more on this series
 lekin hamaari chintaa kaa sabab yah he ki jo patr hamane siries ke bare main bhartiya board ko bheja tha, vah abhi tak unki sarkaar ke paas nahin pahunchaa he
 The PCB chief said that Pakistan would contact the ICC and other member boards if the Indian board withdraws from the series
 unhone kaha, ‘yah siries donon board ke bich emoyu kaa hissaa he jis par donon board ke dastakhat he or jarurat padane par ham yah masalaa uthaaenge
 He said that Pakistan's stand is clear that cricket and politics should be kept separate
 shehryaar ne kaha, ‘donon deshon ke bich sambandh ateet main bhi tanaavpurn rahe hai lekin ham cricket khelte aae hai
 However, India have not played a Test against us since 2007
 ab ham unke peeche nahin bhaagenge or ab unhen faisla lenaa he or dwipaksheeya cricket kii bahaali kii ahmiyat samajni hogi
 He said that Pakistan has started working on Plan 'B' but has not achieved success as only two teams are vacant in December
 unhone kaha, ‘ek zimbabwe he jisase ham is saal do baar khel hi chuke hai or duusari bangladesh he jo apni premier lig main masaroof hogi lekin ham duusare vikalpon par bhi gaur kar rahe hai
 'shaharyar Khan further said,' Not only do we want to play with him but it is also important for India
 bharat-paak siries se donon board ko kaaphi aarthik phayda hoga or is paise se jamini str par cricket ko badhaava diya ja saktaa he
 India may be an economic power but knows that they can earn more money by playing with Pakistan
 ’udhar pakistan ke purv tej gendbaaj shoeb akhtar ne kaha he ki sirf pakistan ko hi bharat se khilne kii jarurat nahin he balki bharat ko bhi isaki jarurat he
 Earlier, Javed Miandad and Rameez Raja have advised PCB to insist on playing cricket with other countries, leaving them in front of India

 mumbai kii ek fast trek satr adaalat ne bollywood abhinayta shaini ahuja ko apni naukaraani se balaatkaar ke maamle main saat saal ke sashram karawas kii buudhvaar ko sajaa sunai
 Shiney was sentenced during the trial despite the victim's overturning his statement
 shaini ke vakil shrikant shivade ne samvaadadaataaon ko bataaya ki nyaayadhish piem chouhan ne aaropee ko mukhya rup se maamle main darj praathmiki par bharosa karte hue doshi tehraaya
 The trial was held in a closed room, so reporters were not allowed to appear in court
 adaalat ne naukaraani dwaara adaalat main die gaye us bayaan ko bhi sweekaar nahin kiya jisamen usne kaha tha ki uske saath balaatkaar nahin kiya gaya
 The judge felt that he gave incorrect evidence
 adaalat main jab faisla sunaaya gaya us vakt shaini apni patni anupam ke saath maujuud the
 Shiney, 38, was wearing a pink shirt and jeans
 ek pulicekarmi ke anusaar jab nyaayadhish ne faisla sunaaya to shaini kii ankhon main aansu aa gaye
 In September last year, the maid was overturned by the allegations leveled against Shiney in which she said that the actor raped her at his Mumbai residence
 usne kaha ki is tarah kii ghatana kabhi nahin hui
 The 20-year-old girl had told the court that she had lodged the complaint against the actor at the behest of the woman who had given her the job of a maid at Shiney's residence
 isse pehle june 2009 main ladki ne police main ek shikaayat darj karai thi jisamen aarope lagaaya gaya tha ki shaini ne uske saath apane awaas par balaatkaar kiya
 Shiney was arrested on 14 June 2009 and released on bail after three months
 pichley saal teen sitambar ko peedita ne adaalat main shaini kii pahchaan kii thi or kaha ki vah unke awaas par naukaraani kaa kaam kiya karti thi, lekin jab usase is ghatana ke bare main poocha gaya to usne kaha ki usase kabhi balaatkaar nahin kiya gaya
 The police, in its 109-page charge sheet, accused Shiney of raping and wrongly keeping the victim locked
 apane bachaav main shaini ne daleel di thi ki use fansaaya gaya
 Hello, Ravish Kumar
 vaise to chatkhaare sa mazaa natwar singh kii moti si kitaab kii un panktiyon main he jisamen ve das saal baad sonia gandhi ke pradhanmantri na banane kaa prasang bayaan kar rahe hai
 Natwar Singh, who has been pushed to the margins of politics, has made a media return from this book
 rajaneta itihaas bhi banaata he or itihaaskaar bhi ban jaataa he
 There are footnotes and the whole chapter is there
 media ke is natvarkaal main naitikta ke shikhar par hai natwar singh or paaydaan par hai unke kirdaar
 Writer and characters also change as power relations change
 is kitaab ke chakkar main sonia gandhi ne bhi kah diya ki ve bhi kitaab likhengi
 He does not mind such things now, but will answer in that book
 manmohan singh ne sanjay baru kii kitaab ke baad aisa kuch nahin kaha tha varna market main ek kitaab or aa jaati
 Well today he has said that the matter between two people should not be brought out for his own benefit
 digvijay singh ne kaha he ki natwar singh ke bete bijepi ke vidhayak hai isliye unhone ye kitaab likhi he
 Natwar Singh has written about how Sonia Gandhi has been autocratic and undemocratic, while one must research how much Natwar Singh has fought for democratic values

 India has refused to sign the wto's Trade Facilitation Agreement
 vaanijya mantri nirmala sitaraman ne kaha ki ham tabhi sin karenge jab bharat ko anaaj kharidne bhandaaran karne or nunatam samarthan mulya dene kii chhot milegi varna bharat vyapaar sarleekaran samjhaute par sin nahin karegaa
 Today in Delhi, Dr
 Prannoy Roy repeatedly asked the US Secretary of State John Carrey and Commerce Minister Penny Pritzker that India needs to collect food grains because we cannot trust the monsoon
 keemton main itnaa utaar chadhaav hota he ki bharat ko stock karnaa padataa he
 So why does America not allow India to store food grains
 to vaanijya mantri paini tarah tarah se jawaab taalati raheen
 Said earlier that we are in India for two-way talks while WTO is a multilateral issue
 ham bharat kii baat samajhate hai, lekin disambar main bali main bharat ne chaar saal kaa vakt maanga tha or sabhi sadsy raji hue the, lekin bharat badal gaya he
 Penny insisted that the deal was beneficial for India
 lekin doctor roy poochhate rahe ki america saaf stand kyon nahin letaa he
 Then Foreign Minister John Kairi had to say that the same agreement was reached in Bali in December that there will be no tampering of India Food Security for the next four years
 ham food security ko baahar nahin kar rahe hai
 Carrie said that India should not miss this opportunity at this time
 uske paas chaar saal kaa vakt to he hi
 Overall, the US has kept a distance from India's side in this matter
 jabaki bharat pahunchane par penni pritzkar ne pitiai se saaf saaf kaha ki bharat ke sin nahin karne par nattejey achche nahin honge
 America is disappointed
 jo sarkaar is vaade par chunaav jeet kar ai ho ki wo kisaanon ko laagat kaa pachaas fisadi phayda sunishchit karegi kya wo aisa kadam uthaa sakati he
 One section wants India to be signed and the other wants it to not
 indian express akhbaar main surajeet es bhalla ne sin ke paksh main morcha khol diya he to devendra sharma ne dainik jaagran main lekh likhakar
 Prakash K
 Ray has taken the line of Devendra Sharma by writing in Prabhat Khabar
 surajeet bhalla kehete hai ki is samjhaute ke kaaran kai mulkon ke bich vyapaar karnaa aasaan hoga or upabhoktaaon ko kam keemton par chizein milengi
 The Modi government is opposing it by following the policies of the Congress government
 vyapaar sarleekaran samjhaute kaa bharat ke food security act se koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 The government will not give subsidy to the farmer but will be able to give food grains to the poor people on subsidy
 is niti se kuch kisaanon ko laabh hua magar garib upabhoktaaon ko nahin
 Devendra Sharma says that India should not sign or will not
 bharat apane str par kheti ke bazaar kaa udaarikaran kar hi rahaa he
 Instead of withdrawing from subsidies, it has been decided to reduce government procurement
 rajyon se kaha he ki ve nunatam samarthan mulya par bonus nahin den
 Like, Madhya Pradesh government should not give bonus of Rs 150 per quintal on wheat
 phir sarkaar jab khud udaarikaran kar rahi he to dablyoo tii o main udaarikaran kii niti kaa virodh kaise kar sakati he
 Trade facilitation agreement is being done so that when you take your goods to another country, you do not have to face too much red tape
 zaraa yaad kiijie ki kaise chunaav ke samay narendra modi is baat par jor dete the ki bijness kii laagat kam honi chahie
 Minimum Government Maxim Governance
 dablyoo tii o kii site par jaayenge to aapako teen baxon kaa zikr milegaa
 India wants food subsidy and storage to be kept in the green box so that it can continue to be allowed even after the new agreement
 laal bakse main sabsidi kaa praavdhaan he jis par saaf saaf roak he
 The yellow box has a subsidy that needs to be reduced gradually
 isi main samarthan mulya or kisaanon ko nakad dene kaa praavdhaan he
 Farmers in India get many types of subsidies in the form of electricity fertilizer loan compensation insurance
 bharat iske khilaaf stand nahin le saktaa
 If Surjeet S
 Bhalla is accepted and accepted, then what should be the result, it should also be discussed
 prime time main sawaal to yahi he jahaan sin karnaa he kijiye, lekin itnaa bataa dijie ki kya chunaav main kisaanon se kaha tha ki aate hi sabsidi khatm kar denge

 or bharat va china ko 22 disambar ko ek-duusare ko kehane ke liye bade prem bhare shabd mil gaye, kam se kam donon deshon ke rishton ke lihaaj se jo beete agast main doklam main 72 din chale gatirodh ke baad lagbhag sainya takaraav ke bahut najadik pahunch gaye the
 Moving ahead of Doklam was at the top of the agenda when Yang Jiechi, China's special representative on border talks, met his Indian counterpart National Security Advisor Ajit Doval for a day-long dialogue
 yang ko aktubar main hi tarakkee dekar 25 sadasyeey paulitte beuro main shaamil kiya gaya tha
 In this sense, the 20th round of border talks may be the last for them as they will be replaced by a successor in March
 donon taraf ke adhikariyon kaa maananaa tha ki doklam gatirodh ke chalate yang kii dilli yatra mahatvapurn ho gai he
 Yang brought the message of his President Xi Jinping which he handed over to Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 isamen kaha gaya tha ki donon deshon ko 'kai peedhishon tak dosti' or 'punarutthan main bhagidaar' banane kii aakanksha kerani chahie
 Given the recent tension, this diplomatic language was even more surprising
 ek bhartiya adhikari kaa kahana tha ki doklam ke saare tanaav ke baad bhi uske shantipurna samaadhaan se yah baat rekhaankit hui ki sahi jagah par maujuud vyavasthaaen kaam kar jaati hai
 But this officer also admitted that this also proves how wrong communication also creates a situation of confrontation
 chini kheme kaa ab bhi yahi kahana he ki teen simaaon ke milan bindu ke nikat sadak ke nirmaan kii apni yojanaon ke bare main unhone bhartiya seemaa tukdiiyon ko do baar jaankaree di thi
 On the other hand, Indian military sources say that this was not the case
 unka kahana he ki unhone maukhik chetavanee di thi ki sadak ko badhaakar bhartiya seemaa ke thik muhane par samvedansheel siliguri coridor tak lekar aana, or vah bhi us ilaake main jise bharat va bhutan donon hi bhutani ilaaka maanate hai, laal rekha ko paar karne ke baraabar tha or china ne in chetavaniyon par dhyaan nahin diya
 The deadlock started with this
 videsh mantralay kaa kahana he ki donon pakshon main is baat par rajamandi he ki seemaa vivaad kaa antim nibatara hone tak shanti va sauhaard banaae rakhana jaruri he
 It was also underlined that both countries should strengthen the points of agreement and find mutually acceptable solutions to the dispute, while respecting sensitivity, concerns and aspirations
 doklam par bharat ne china ko phir se yah saaf kar diya ki koi bhi sadak jo bharat kii suraksha ke liye khatra paidaa karti ho, sweekaar nahin kii jaaegi
 On its part, China has made it clear that it will strengthen its troops where it considers necessary elsewhere in the disputed plateau
 beijing main china institute for contemparari international relations main samrik visheshgy hu shisheng kaa kahana tha ki ''is baatcheet se yah najar aata he ki donon pakshon ne agrim morchon par samvaad par jor daalane ko ahmiyat di he taaki seemaa par galat faisle or doklam jaise gatirodh phir se utpann na hon'' sainya mukhyalayon ke bich hotline ko saidhantik manjuuri de di gai he

 maharashtra koaparative banks federation ke adhyaksh vidyadhar anaskar kaa maananaa he ki desh ke majboot coaparative bainkon ke liye yah sunaharaa mauka he vah apana graahak base majboot kare
 Vidyadhar Anaskar, president of Maharashtra Cooperative Banks Federation, called it a conspiracy of private banks
 unke mutabiknijee bainkonki ghoshnaa ki chaar tranjaction ke baad graahakon ko prayek tranjaction ke liye 150 rupee dene honge puri tarah se galat he
 According to Anaskar, private banks earn profits only due to such hidden charges
 anaskar ke mutabik nijee bainkon ke is faisle se aam janata cashles hone ke bajaae di hui limit ke andar paryaapt cash nikaalane lagenge or unke liye cash rakhana hi phaayde kaa sauda rahegaa
 • After four transactions, private banks have fixed a charge of Rs
 150
 is nirnay main sarkaar kaa koi role nahin he
 State-run banks have not made any such announcement
 or na hi kooparative bainkon kaa is faisle se koi lenadena he
 • Private banks say that this decision has been taken to increase cashless transactions but there is a conspiracy to withdraw money from people's pockets
 • log ab bank main paise jamaa karne se bachenge or bank se zyada se zyada cash nikaalane kaa chalan badhenga
 If someone needs hundred rupees, then they will start withdrawing one to two thousand rupees
 • nijee bank kii graahakon kii jeb se paisa nikaalkar apana munafa badhaane vaali soch he
 • It is hidden money lending by private bank
 isse inkaa bada munafa hoga
 If you look at the charges of private bank, then instrument charges, minimum balance charges, check bounce charges are levied
 • aise bank garib customer ke bharose nahin baithte
 At the same time, such private banks do not support the government's efforts where it can connect every poor person in the country with the help of banking
 • in privet banks ke hiden chargees , saamaanya aadmi kii soch se baahar he
 He does not even know how these banks withdraw money from the customer
 inke ghoshit interest rate or aghoshit interest rate main bhi bahut fark hota he
 • According to Vidyadhar Anaskar, cooperative banks should take advantage of this opportunity and attract customers to their bank
 koaparative banks main kisi tarah kaa tranjaction charge nahin lagata
 • Vidyadhar Anaskar has claimed that the co-operative bank does not impose hidden charges like private banks and hence there is a big opportunity for cooperative banks to increase their customer base

 zaahir he sarkaar ke is faisle main logon ko jepi ke viraasat ko sanbhaalane kii baat kam, raajnneeti zyada lag rahi he
 In 1986, Jayaprakash Memorial Foundation was established in the Sitabadiyara part of Uttar Pradesh under the leadership of former Prime Minister Chandrashekhar to carry forward jp's legacy
 jab tak chandrashekhar jinda rahe, tab tak to trust thik-thaak chalata rahaa
 a school for girls was opened, a library opened and a Khadi Gramodhog Bhavan in JP Nagar
 lekin chandrashekhar ke nidhan ke baad trust par kabje ko lekar court kachhari tak maamla chalaa
 In 2010, some broke away from the old trust and formed the Jayaprabha Foundation
 ye trust bana bihar ke lala tolaa main
 The distance between the two trusts is just two kilometers
 tark diya gaya ki ye trust jepi ke janmasthali par bana he
 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar got along
 us vakt jediu or bijepi saath-saath the, to laalkrishna adwani ne jepi kii janmasthali se bhrashtachar ke khilaaf rath yatra shuru kii
 After this, the journey of development started in this area

 kuch par amal hua, to kuch par aadchan aa gai
 Meanwhile, there was a political divorce between JDU and BJP

 Therefore, to redeem jp's name, the central government also announced to build a national memorial at jp's birthplace

 The secretary of the up-based Jaypee Trust is now Ravishankar Singh, grandson of Chandrasekhar

 pradhan nyaayadhish sahit nyaayamurti deepak mishra or nyaayamurti di
 why
 chandrachud kii peeth ke samaksh pesh hue varisht vakil rakesh dvivedi or vakil shoeb alam ne kaha ki kendra ko diwaali ke baad yachikaaon par sunwaayi ko lekar koi aapatti nahin he
 The bench said, "all the petitions will be heard after Diwali
" ’’ isse pehle nyaayalay ne is maamle kii sunwaayi paanch nyaayadhishon kii peeth dwaara kiye jane kaa samarthan kiya tha, yadi yah anuchhed samvidhan ke adhikaar kshetra se baahar he yaa isamen koi prakriyaagat khami he
 The court said that a bench of three judges would hear the case and then send it to a bench of five judges
 nyaayalay charu vali khanna kii ore se samvidhan ke anuchhed 35e or jammu-kashmir ke samvidhan ke praavdhaan chah ko chunauti dene vaali yachika par sunwaayi kar rahaa tha
 Both provisions are linked to the "permanent residents" of Jammu and Kashmir
 yachika main kuch vishesh praavdhaanon ko chunauti di gayi he jaise
 
 
 Not getting the right to property to a woman married to someone outside the state
 is praavdhaan ke tahat rajya ke baahar ke kisi vyakti se vivaah karne vaali mahila kaa sampatti par adhikaar samaapt ho jaataa he, itnaa hi nahin uske bete ko bhi sampatti kaa adhikaar nahin miltaa
 The comments video- jammu kashmir - anuchhed 35 e ke masale par pidipi-neshnal conference saath Article 35A, added to the Constitution in 1954 by the Presidential Order, gives privileges and facilities to the permanent residents of Jammu and Kashmir
 peeth ne kaha, ‘‘sabhi yachikaaon par diwaali ke baad sunwaayi hogi
 "earlier, the court had supported the hearing of the case by a five-judge bench, if the article is outside the jurisdiction of the constitution or there is a procedural flaw in it
" nyaayalay ne kaha ki teen nyaayadhishon kii peeth maamle kii sunwaayi karegi or phir ise paanch nyaayadhishon kii peeth ke paas bhejegi
 The court was hearing Charu Wali Khanna on a petition challenging Article 35A of the Constitution and provision six of the Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir
 donon praavdhaan jammu-kashmir ke ‘‘sthai nivaasiyon’’ se jude hue hai
 Some special provisions have been challenged in the petition viz

 Even Joshi could not understand
 jo is dharti kaa hoga or jis par janata ko bharosa hoga ki yah mere saath khadaa hoga, vahi jitegaa
 Describing Modi as an outsider, he said that if Modi is contesting from two places, the first mistrust is that in the people of Benaras, where will he stay and which seat will he leave
 sabhi ko vishwaas he ki vah banaras chhodkar bhaag jaaenge
 While filing his nomination in Vadodara, he said yesterday that my work place and birthplace is Gujarat
 to phir banaras kya he
 He said that 'har Har Mahadev' has always resonated in Banaras and 'har Har Modi' will never work here
 raay ne kaha ki jo vyakti puure desh ko todane kii baat karata he, use banaras ke log sweekaar nahin karenge
 Banaras Ganga is a city of Jamni culture and 'har Har Modi' will not work here
 yahaan sadiyon se har har mahadev hota aayaa he or aage bhi hota rahegaa

 unhone kaha ki kejariwal ke ladane kaa koi matlab nahin he
 He could not win the hearts of the people of Delhi, where ink is being thrown at him every day, and sometimes chante are being killed
 banaras bhagodo ko sweekaar nahin karata
 This is the city of Baba Bhole where the brave are valued, not the fugitives

 ) maine sabase zyada cricket apane schuli dinon main dekha he
 Understand that the entire summer vacation was spent watching test matches and doing summer vacation homework
 yah aadat baad main bhi bani rahi grajuation tak jitne bhi nots banaae vah test match dekhte hue
 There was a time when my father and i used to watch day-and-night matches overnight, which apart from being a three-day program of election results, would be the other important shared event for both of us
 raajnneeti or cricket kii samaj tabhi papa ke saath viksit hui or skool va college ke dinon main donon main gaahe-bagaahe haath bhi aazmaati rahi hum
 My relationship with cricket on the field was ended by family members kissing my cheeks with a cocktail ball thrown in the sky for fours or sixes
 extiyathan main base-ball khilne lag gai, kyonki uski gend kohde yaa sitafal kii tarah hoti he jo aapako chot to pahunchaa sakati he, par usase cheharaa karaab hone kaa dar nahin hota
 But there is no problem in understanding cricket even today, whether it is a test match, 20-20 or one-day and when i understand, i am thrilled
 
 
 jaise aaj hui
 i think every girl should love cricket at some point in their life
 
 
 cricketer se naa kar paaen tab bhi
 
 
 Because by not doing so, they will be deprived of a very important adventure in life
 cricket khilne ke liye hamaare paas kai vajah bhi hai, sharir or dimag ko chust-durust rakhane ke alaava yah yaa koi bhi anya khel hamaare bheetar competative bhaavana kaa to sanchaar karti hi he
 
 
 It also gives motivation to fight in odd situations
 aap khud hi sochie ki hamaare aas-paas jitani bhi mahilaayein yaa purush kisi bhi paribhaasha ke anusaar agar safal hai to koi naa koi khel se unka judaav zarur he
 That game can be cricket, adventure sports as well as chess
 kapil dev jab cricket se ritair hue to golf khilne lage, bachhendri paal jab everest par fatah karke lautin to jamshedpur main tata ke karmchaariyon ko khel-kud kii training dene lageen
 Sunil Gavaskar, PT Usha, Mary Kom, Sania Mirza, Saina Nehwal, Mithali Raj, Anjum Chopra, Ritu Rani etc
 yahaan mahilaon ke naam juyada isliye maine liye kyonki khelon main mahilaon kii juyada bhagidaari kii zarurat he
 However, the glamor and romanticism associated with cricket is not with other sports, so just like we answer the easy question in the first exam, you should love cricket, not because it will give you your Prince Charming, but because That this whole life will not allow your life to be charm-less
 aapako kabhi haarane nahin degaa, aapako kabhi depressant yaa avsaad main doobane nahin degaa
 The fight that comes up to the last ball on the field will give you the strength to fight in every difficult moment of life, when a bowler throws a yawker towards you, you will face him with full force and when a spinner throws a googly
 You will also try to give him a googly in return
 kehane kaa matlab yah he ki ye khel aapako zindagi ke shah-maat main maahir kar degaa, itnaa ki agar aap kabhi clin bold yaa hit-wicket bhi hue to akele main khud ko yah kahkar khush kar sakate hai ki yaar, ampire ko samaj nahin aayaa ye to no-ball tha
 The bottom line is that a cricketer never loses forever, every other match brings with him new challenges as well as energy
 isliye pyaar kiijie
 
 
 From cricket, even if the medium is a cricketer

 Union Minister m Venkaiah Naidu on Thursday expressed hope that Pakistan would realize its mistakes and stop aiding and abetting terrorism against India after conducting a surgical strike on India's terrorist attacks across the Line of Control last night
 
 naidu ne kaha ki abhiyaan bharat kii dharti main ghuspaith ke kisi bhi prayaas ko vifal karne ke bhartiya sena ke adhikaar kaa hissaa hai

 However, there were SPG commandos around Rahul, who were taking care of his security
 ye bhi padhein:aakhir is bag main he kya, jo har vakt saath liye dikhte hai rahul
 
 
 Rahul Gandhi has shown his connection with the public even before selfie or sometimes tea
 bharuch ke ek road sho matansha naam kii ek ladki ke saath selfi clic kii thi
 During Rahul Gandhi's roadshow in Bharuch, a girl unexpectedly boarded Rahul's van and gifted him flowers and took a selfie with him

 Its positive results are also being seen
 IRCTC ke pravaktaa siddharth singh ke mutabik base kichan is system kii nigaraanee se pehle har maheene 80 se 85 shikaayatein railway ke record main darj hoti thim
 But after using Artificial Intelligence, now these complaints are just 10 to 15

 These kitchens supply food in premium trains like Shatabdi, Rajdhani
 desh ke alag-alag hisson main maujuud yah rasoi maikenised he or yahaan par badi taadaad main log kaam karte hai
 Railways have made modalities to work in these kitchens
 saaf-safai kaa khaas dhyaan rakhaa jaataa he lekin in sabake baavjood shikaayatein aati hi rahati hai
 Maintaining the quality of food being made in these base kitchens is a big challenge in itself
 yahaan par jo karigar khaanaa banaate hai unako apane sir par khaas tareeke ke kapade kii topi kaa istemaal karnaa jaruri he
 Along with this, dress is mandatory for those who cook
 har ek khanpan kii cheez kaa taur-tarika nishchit he lekin in sabake baavjood sabhi taur-tareekon ko mufeed dhang se lagu karnaa apane aap main badi chunauti he
 For this, IRCTC decided to resort to new technology
 yah takanic hai dephination CCTV or inke saath judaa hua artificial intelligence kaa software he
 According to Siddharth Singh, website of live streaming IRCTC, live streaming of high definition CCTV installed in the country's 13 base kitchens can be seen on the website of IRCTC
 koi bhi vyakti website par jaakar purab se lekar pashchim tak or uttar se lekar dakshin tak maujuud sabhi rasoiyon kii sthiti kaa taaja haal dekh saktaa he
 He explained how CCTV becomes very important with Artificial Intelligence
 darasal,footagemein dikhne vaale kisi bhi ulanghan ko computer khud-ba-khud pahchaan kar report bana letaa he
 After this the report is sent to the concerned officer
 masalan, kisi kichan main agar koi jaanavar yaa keedaa najar aa rahe hai to computer uskaa naam bataa degaa
 In any such situation, the report is automatically sent to the concerned high officials by inserting the photo timing
 is puure system ko behtareen banane ke iraade se nai dilli main CCTV control room bhi banaaya gaya he
 In this control room, IRCTC employees keep a close watch on all the kitchens across the country

 indian premier lig (ipel) timen bhi fitness ko lekar gambhir ho chuki hai
 The franchise is not in a mood to compromise the fitness of its players at any cost
 ab ipel main bhi team india kii tarj par yo-yo test laai jaaegi
 Last year, the Indian Cricket Control Board (BCCI) made this special test mandatory to test the fitness of players

 Meanwhile, Sunrisers Hyderabad, Kolkata Knight Riders, Delhi Daredevils and Chennai Super Kings have opted for more traditional fitness tests for their players
 aakhir kya he yo-yo testsiob jaraa 'yo-yo' pareekshan ko bhi samaj len
 With the help of several 'cones' two lines are made at a distance of 20 meters
 ek khilaadi rekha ke peeche apana paanv rakhkar shuruyaat karata he or nirdesh milte hi daudna shuru karata he
 The player runs between two consecutive lines and when the beep rings, he has to turn
 har ek minute yaa isi tarah se teji badhati jaati he
 If the line is not reached on time, then two more 'beeps' have to catch pace
 agar khilaadi do chhoron par teji hasil nahin kar paata he, to pareekshan roak diya jaataa he
 The entire process is based on software, in which the results are recorded
