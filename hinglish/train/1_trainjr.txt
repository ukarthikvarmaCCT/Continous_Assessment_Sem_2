 After the cancellation of the 'BA Program' classes without any prior notice, the students faced a state of disarray at all the study centers of the Open Schooling School (SOL) of Delhi University
 ek chaatr sanghathan ne yah aarope lagaaya he
 However, a SOL official said that these classes were not scheduled for this Sunday
 krantikari yuva sanghathan (kevaies) ne aarope lagaaya ki bie (program) ke vidhyaarthiyon ke liye kakshaen sabhi kendron par ravivaar ko radd kar di gai, jabaki esoel prashasan ne chaatro ko is bare main koi purv soochna nahin di thi
 The organization alleged that the students in Gargi College encircled the entrance and blocked the road when classes were canceled
 sanghathan ne kaha ki vah somvaar ko north campus main esoel bhawan ke aage ek pradarshan karegaa
 SOL Director CS Dubey said, "BA program classes were not scheduled for this Sunday
 is ravivaar bi com kii kakshaon kaa kaarykram tha
 '' cinema ke parde par dusron ko apane khaas andaaj main 'khamosh' karaane vaale shatrughna sinha in dinon apni party kii 'lakshmana rekha' paar karke bayaan de rahe hai
 Actually, assembly elections in Bihar are near and Shatrughan's ambition is not hidden from anyone
 sawaal uthta he ki'bihari babu' siyaasi jameen parasachamuch bade kaddavar netaa hai yaa ve 'aatm-mugdhata' ke shikaar hai
 Through further questions, those points were discussed, which can become an obstacle in the path of Shatrughan's desired success
 
 
 1
 Not confused about his political stature? Shatrughan Sinha may have managed to get on the film screen, but he has to understand that his stature in politics has not yet grown so much that he can directly compete with the central leadership
 lagaataar bagawati sur se party ke bheetar unki image negative banati ja rahi he, jo unke siyaasi kariyar ke liye behatar nahin he
 2
 nai yuva peedi par kitna prabhaav?shatrughna sinha agar paala badalakar kisi duusari party kaa daaman tham len, phir bhi ve koi khaas karishma kar sakenge, isamen baari andeh he
 a large proportion of the voters are of that age group, who have not felt the charisma of Shatrughan Sinha on the film screen
 nai soch vaali yuva peedi ko shatru kitna lubhaa paaenge? saath hi party badalane se unki chhavi par bhi bura asar hoga
 3
 jati kii naiya se hoga bedaa paar?shatrughna agar yah samaj rahe hon ki ve jati kii naiya par savaar hokar har baar kisi party kaa bedaa paar laga denge, to yah bhi unka bhram ho saktaa he
 If their calculation fails in the current caste equation, then it will not be surprising
 4
 'kranti' by displeasing the public? It is a different thing to do 'kranti' against your own party, but Shatrughan Sinha has recently taken some steps which hardly appeals to a large section of the public
 mumbai ko khun ke aansu rulaane vaale yaqub memon ko faansee mili, to shatrughna ne 'dayaa' dikhalaane main der nahin lagaai
 When the speaker showed the way out for 5 days to the mps who were constantly making noise by disrupting the dignity of the Parliament, Bihari Babu was 'disappointed'
 lagata he ki ve public kaa mood bhaanpane main naakaam ho rahe hai
 5
 bin seva ke hi 'mewa' kii chaah?shatrughna babu ne abhi bijepi kii utani seva nahin kii he, jitna karke koi kisi bade pad kaa hakdaar banataa he
 He will be well aware of LK Advani's sacrifice and penance and its results
 
 
 
 So you will listen to your cynic too, will Bihari Babu ask to remain 'silent'? karina kapur khan (kareena Kapoor Khan) ne apane bete taimur ali khan (taimur Ali Khan) ko lekar ek khulaasa kiya he, jisaki charchaa har jagah ho rahi he
 Actress Kareena Kapoor is currently judging the dance reality show 'dance India Dance'

 Chidambaram on Saturday admitted that his ministry has been embarrassed after several mistakes were revealed in the list of terrorists handed over to Pakistan
 lekin unhone kaha ki un vyaktiyon se maafee maangane kii jarurat nahin he, jinke naam bhulvash bhagodon kii suchi main shaamil ho gaye the
 Chidambaram said, "this incident obviously embarrasses the Union Home Ministry
 " gyaat ho bharat dwaara taiyaar kii gai 50 ati vaanchhiton kii suchi main pichley saptaah bhayanak galtiyaan saamne ain thim
 This list was submitted to Islamabad in March, as the terrorists included in the list have been claimed to be hiding in Pakistan
 lekin suchi main shaamil do vyaktiyon ko bharat main paaya gaya
 One is living in Thane after being released on bail and the other is in a jail in Mumbai
 chidambaram ne kaha, "ham kendriya jaanch beuro (sibiai) dwaara di gai suchi par nirbhar hote hai
 
 
 The CBI prepares a list of the most wanted, against whom a red corner notice has been issued
 kripaya dhyaan den ki galtiyaan suchi ke ek hisse main hui hai, or vah suchi sibiai ne taiyaar kii he
 "it seems that Chidambaram was repeating his earlier stance, in which he said that the CBI does not come under the purview of the Union Home Ministry, but under the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions
 chidambaram ne kaha, "yah sharmnaak he, yah khedjanak he
 Since the list was formally submitted by the Union Home Secretary, we have taken constructive responsibility for it
 " chidambaram ne un sujhaavon ko bhi khaarij kar diya ki jin logon ke naam galati se suchi main shaamil ho gaye hai, unase maafee maangane kii koi jarurat he
 He said, "I don't think this is a case in which we should apologize to anyone
" yadi hamen maafee maangani chahie, yadi hamen khed prakat karnaa chahie, to vah sab ham kar chuke hai
 That it is a human mistake not to check the list
 us str par main samajhataa hum ki hamane khed jataayaa he or hamen abhi bhi khed he
 But i think you are taking this matter far

 He used to threaten to kill anyone after telling them about it
 police pravaktaa rabindra kumaar ne jaankaree dete hue bataaya ki13 varshiya kishorica padosi sonu sharma use acchhee tarah se jaanata tha
 Due to this, both were known
 19 varshiya aaropee ne isi baat kaa phayda uthaakar 13 varshiya naabalika ko apni havas kaa shikaar bana daalaa
 He then rapes the girl for several days, threatening to kill her
 pehle to ladki uski dhamkiyon se darati rahi lekin shuukravaar ko pareshaan hokar usne parijanon ko aapbeetee sunai
 Then the matter reached the police
 shikaayat milte hi police harakat main aa gai or dabish dekar aaropee sonu sharma kogiraftarkar liya
 The accused hails from Rajasthan

 congress ke varisht netaa pi chidambaram ne ravivaar ko kaha ki 'baahubal' kii niti se jammu-kashmir kaa masalaa nahin sulajhegaa
 He said that all governments have tried to deal with this 'challenge' by deploying more troops and killing protesters
 purv kendriya grih mantri ne twitor par likhaa, 'jammu-kashmir kii har sarkaar or centre kii har sarkaar zyada chetavaniyon, zyada sainikon or zyada kanoonon ke jariye is chunauti se nipati he

 (apart from the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it has been published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) The former Union Home Minister wrote on Twitter, 'every government in Jammu and Kashmir and every government at the center has dealt with this challenge through more warnings, more troops and more laws
 ' chidambaram ne likhaa, 'baahubal vaali niti se koi phayda nahin hone vaala - mantriyon ke sakht bayaan, thalsena pramukh kii nattejey bhugatne kii chetavanee, zyada sainikon kii tainaati yaa pradarshnakariyon ko markar
 On the other hand, Congress General Secretary Digvijay Singh said that it is necessary to win the hearts of the people of Kashmir who are being killed by both terrorists and security forces
 unhone kaha ki pichley kuch samay main halaat bigade hai
 He claimed that the situation was normal during the previous Congress government, but the situation has worsened during the current government of PDP-BJP

 ) maharashtra ke raajnneetik pariwaron main viraasat kii jang puraani he
 Right now the case of NCP supremo Sharad Pawar is very fresh
 media main aisi kai khabaren hai jinamein pavaar ke bhattije or unki beti ke bich siyaasi khinchataan kii baaten ai hai
 Sharad Pawar's nephew Ajit Pawar and his daughter Supriya Sule are well-known names in Maharashtra on which ncp's entire politics continues but now there are complaints of rift in it
 sharad pavaar or ajit pavaar ke bich manutav ko chachaa-bhattije kii ladaai ke rup main bhi dekha ja rahaa he
 However, this is not the first incident in Maharashtra
 dhyaan rahe maharashtra kii raajnneeti main chachaa bhattije ke takaraav kaa purana itihaas he
 Bal Thackeray and Raj Thackeray are examples of this
 duusari misaal gopinath munde ke bhattije dhananjay munde kii di jaati he
 If Sharad Pawar and Ajit Pawarhaliya look at the news, then we can say that everything is not going well in Sharad Pawar's family
 loksabhaa chunaav se thik pehle pavaar parivaar main siyaasi jang chhid gai he
 According to reports, Ajit Pawar, son of Sharad Pawar's elder brother Anandrao Pawar, has gone into protest
 ensipi kii ab tak kii jo raajnneeti rahi he usamen ajit pavaar ko sharad pavaar kaa uttaradhikari mana jaataa he
 But Pawar has put forward his daughter Supriya Sule
 supriya sule saansad hai jo apane pita kii paaramparik baraamati seat se loksabhaa kaa chunaav ladati hai
 This is not the first time Ajit Pawar has challenged Sharad Pawar inside the NCP and decided to contest his son Parth Pawar for the Lok Sabha elections
 kaha ja rahaa he ki ajit pavaar kii isi jid ke kaaran sharad pavaar ne khud chunaav nahin ladane kaa elaan kiya he
 Seeing the earlier news, he had decided to give up his political retirement and fight Madha seat, but when Ajit Pawar announced to fight the son from Maval seat, Sharad Pawar himself backed down
 isi kram main ajit pavaar ke duusare bhai ke bete sharad pavaar ke samarthan main utar gaye hai
 That's why Rohit Pawar, Ajit Pawar's brother's son, recently wrote a Facebook post urging Sharad Pawar to contest
 rohit pavaar ne sharad pavaar ke maharashtra kii raajnneeti main yogadan ko yaad kiya or kaha ki unako chunaav ladanaa chahie
 Looking at the situation now, it can be said that this political drama of the Pawar family will continue
 thakare parivaar main khinchatanshivsena ke sansthaapak netaa swargeey bal thakare ke swaabhaavik vaaris ke taur par log unke bete uddhav thakare ko nahin balki unke bhattije raaj thakare ko dekhte the
 People expected that Thackeray would hand over the command of Shiv Sena to Raj Thackeray but it did not happen and Shiv Sena command went into the hands of Uddhav Thackeray
 iske baad raaj thakare ne shivasena chhod kar apni party maharashtra navnirmaan sena (emenes) bana lee
 Bal Thackeray was 80 years old when Raj Thackeray formed MNS
 party banane ke peeche ek vajah yah bhi di jaati he ki us vakt (2006) uddhav ke saath raaj thakare ke matbhed zyada gaharaa gaye the or shivasena ke tikat vitaran main bhi donon aamane-saamne aa gaye the
 Raj Thackeray was then sidelined in making party decisions
 raaj thakare ko sunne vaale acchhee tarah jaanate hai ki unki bolne kii style bal thakare se milti he kyonki unhone bahut kuch apane chachaa se siikhaa he
 Being separated from the Shiv Sena, Raj Thackeray also said that the Shiv Sena has lost its edge, so they do not want to continue in it
 raaj thakare kaa hindutv or marathi maanush kaa naaraa bhi bal thakare se miltaa he
 a recent major incident between Raj and Uddhav Thackeray was that the MNS MLA was broken and amalgamated by Uddhav Thackeray's party Shiv Sena
 is ghatana ke baad donon main adaavat or gaharaa gai
 Munda family's feud is the leader of the old NCP
 gopinath munde or unke bhattije dhananjay munde ke bich khinchataan bhi jagajaahir he
 Let me tell you that in 2014 NCP decided to make Dhananjay Munde the leader of the opposition party in the Legislative Council
 ye faisla isliye tha kyonki aisa karke ensipi pichhadon kii raajnneeti main munde kii donon betiyon ke mukaable dhananjay ko istemaal karnaa chaahati thi
 Dhananjay Munde was first sent by Gopinath Munde to the Legislative Council
 magar chachaa se alag hone ke baad dhananjay ne vidhanparishad se tyaagptr de diya tha
 The NCP then sent him to the Legislative Council with his quota
 baad main ensipi ne dhananjay ko netaa pratipaksh banaakar bijepi ke pichde varg ke vot bank main sendhamari kii koshish kii
 At that time, Gopinath Munde's elder daughter Pankaja Munde played a big role in bjp's victory in the Maharashtra Assembly elections and addressed several rallies
 ise dekhte hue ensipi ne pankaja ke saamne dhananjay munde ko mohara banaaya
 By doing this, the NCP tried to expand its reach not only in Marathwada but also in the backward class of Maharashtra
 dhananjay munde kaa yahi kaam tab ensipi main chagan bhujabal karte the
 According to experts, Gopinath Munde himself considered Bhujbal as his leader in backward politics
 ise dekhte hue dhananjay munde ko aage badha kar pavaar parivaar ne bhujabal ke bhi par katarne kii koshish kii
 Bollywood actress Katrina Kaif, who has looked away from glamor in her upcoming film Politics, has said that she selects any film based on her discretion
 25 varshiya katrina ne kaha 'main apane vivek ke aadhaar par faisle karti hum or dekhati hum ki patakatha kitni damdaar he
 i am very hopeful about the release of the film 'rajneeti' this year as i have got the opportunity to work with some of the best talent in the film industry
 'prakaash jha nirdeshit yah film raajnneeti par aadhaarit he or chaar june ko relies ho rahi he
 However, Katrina denied that the success of the film 'new York' has changed her outlook towards career

 She is currently busy shooting for Farah Khan's 'teesamar Khan' and her co-star in the film is Akshay Kumar with whom most of her films have been hits
 twachaa kii dekhbhaal ke sambandh main katrina kaa kahana he ki vah apana mechap hataane ke prati bahut saavdhaan rahati hai
 Apart from this, she also cares about which product she uses

 The Tata group was largely driven by JRD Tata with its magic personality, although some of the Tata companies had a small stake in the Mentata family
 mujhe yaad he ki ek vakt aisa aayaa tha jab tata steel main tata ke paanch fisadi ke mukaable birla parivaar kii hissedari zyada (6-7 fisadi) ho gai thi
 Despite this, every year
 di
 Birla used to send voting papers to JRD Tata before the annual general meeting
 jab ratan tata ne kaman sanbhali to us vakt tata samooh main chaar-paanch prabhaavshaalee kshatrap the, jinhone yah kahkar hallaa machaana shuru kar diya ki ve log jin companiyon kaa netritv kar rahe the, ve tata samooh kii nahin thim
 Ratan Tata's first three-four years were extremely difficult
 unhen in logon se nibatna padaa
 jrd's approach in such cases was that he spoke openly, while Ratan was an introvert
 in halaat ne unhen swaamitv kii ahmiyat samajhane main madad kii or unhone badi jaddojahad ke saath companiyon main tata kii hissedari badhaane kii koshish kerani shuru kii
 In this way, he made sure that the rights of management of the companies remained with the Tatas
 partiyon main jearady har tarah ke logon se milakar baat karnaa pasand karte the or sabakaa dhyaan apni ore khinch lete the
 In contrast, Ratan liked to have dinner with select people
 unki chalati to ve akele hi khaanaa pasand karte
 He did not like going to parties
 logon ke bich main yaa kisi bade samooh se baat karne main unhen dikkat hoti thi
 He was more comfortable with fewer people
 pichley do dashak ke dauraan haalanki is maamle main unhone khud ko bahut sudhara he
 Even during the holidays, he used to visit the Tata group's Lake House in Pune, while JRD used to come to Jamshedpur and meet all kinds of people from tribal welfare associations to hospitals
 aise pravaason ke dauraan log unase milane ko betaab rahete the
 Then i would organize small meetings where JRD could talk with 10 to 15 people at a time
 unhen aisi baatcheet main majaa aata tha
 Every ten minutes i would bring a new group
 is tarah ve kai logon se mil pate the
 Although Ratan did not hesitate to meet anyone, but every time he needed a new place
 jearady or ratan donon hi licensadhari pilot the
 Earlier it used to be that they had to come to Jamshedpur to register their license to keep their license updated
 us vakt tak tata steel ke paas do jahaaj hua karte the, jo akasar unhen tatanagar le aate the
 Ratan started a flying club in Jamshedpur when he was a junior officer at Tata Steel
 yah club itnaa lokapriy hua ki roosi modi ne 50 saal kii umr main license hasil kiya
 People used to ask me why i did not take a license? JRD was most interested in aviation, while Ratan wanted Telco or Tata Motors
 sattar ke dashak tak jearady air india ke pramukh rahe or vahi unki sabase pasandida company thi
 Ratan was also the chairman of Air India for some time
 donon main sabase badi samanta yah thi ki ve bahut sahaj or jamini the
 He did not like people to run after him
 donon ne jivan kaa adhiktar hissaa company ke kiraaye ke makaan main guzaara
 i remember an incident of travel with JRD
 maine airport par unka bag uthaa liya
 He gently pressed my wrist and said, "if need be, i will ask for your help
 ” baad main nabbe ke dashak main jab maine ratan ke saath tata steel ke liye paisa jutaney ke liye europe or sudur-purv main yatraaen kin, to unhone kabhi bhi khud ke saath chairman kii haisiyat se vishesh bartaav kiye jane par jor nahin diya
 During these visits, Ratan always kept his point very politely and if there was a different opinion of the top officers on any issue, then there was no problem in accepting them
 apane vichaar ve kabhi bhi ham par nahin thopate the
 i came to know about him when he was looking at Nelco in the early seventh decade
 baad main jab ve tata sans ke board sadsy ke rup main waapas aae, or yah shaayad aathven dashak kii shuruyaat kii baat hogi, tab bhi ve bahut vinamr the
 They go deep into any issue, so it is not easy to fool them
 unke saath ek or khubi judi he—unki yaaddaasht bahut tej he
 Ratan Tata's era was different from jrd's
 jearady ke daur main sarkaar hamen bataati thi ki kitna utpaadan karnaa he, kab karnaa he or kise bechnaa he
 Economic liberalization began around the time Ratan became chairman
 lekin donon hi kaarobaar main naitikta ke hami the
 In the biography of JRD, he felt that if Tata used the methods prevalent in Indian business, he could be twice as large a company, but for this he had to adopt the same methods
 ratan tata bhi hameshaa kaha karte the ki ve aisa kuch bhi nahin karenge jisase unhen raat main neend na aa sake

 har din yahi sochate the ki jaise hi 10veen pariksha samaapt hogi, ham alag-alag ho jaaenge
 Our parents were also upset with this group because we could not live without meeting them even for a day
 ravivaar ko bhi special class ke liye skool chale jate the or der shaam tak hi ghar waapas aate the
 Gradually, the apprenticeship came and ended
 hamamen zyaadaatar logon ne padhai karne ke liye alag-alag shahar jane kaa faisla kiya or uske baad aaj saat saal biit jane par bhi ham kabhi ek saath ikatthe nahin mil paae

 pradhanmantri narendra modi or chini raashtrapati shi jinping ke bich 27-28 april ko hone vaali mulaakaat ko lekar bhale hi agenda tay na ho
 But this meeting is important in many ways
 ye to tay he ki jab modi-jinping milenge to baatcheet kaa mudda neerav modi kaa pratyrpan or aatanki masood ajahar par shikanja kasnaa nahin hoga
 Without an agenda, the two heads of state have two days to negotiate, and there is no draft yet on what issues will be discussed between the two
 aise main donon netaaon kii koshish hogi ki un muddon par baatcheet kii jaae jo donon deshon ke hit main hai or uskaa vyapak asar ho
 Be it the issue of terrorism or trade
 agar aatankwaad par baatcheet hogi ko mudda keval masood ajahar nahin hoga
 Because India will try to get a message in the world through talks on the issue of terrorism that two of the world's most powerful forces are worried about global terrorism
 yahi nahin, is daure par neerav modi ko lekar bhi koi baatcheet kaa agenda nahin he
 Because the issue is going on at a different level between the two countries

 us vakt rajeev gandhi ke china daure se vyapaar ke str par bade samjhaute hue the or use aarthik najariye se aaj bhi ahm mana jaataa he
 Expecting a big deal, if you look at PM Modi's visit, it is considered very important
 bina agenda jab donon netaa milenge to baatcheet ke muddon ko lekar saamne khulaa aasmaan hoga
 In such a situation, the focus will be on those issues which are appreciated for the efforts of both countries for economic, social and international change
 usapar charchaa kii koshish rahegi
 Relationship will get new dimension According to Global Times, this meeting of the two will reduce the distance between the two powers of Asia and will strengthen the relationship
 rishte sudharne kaa matlab he ki donon deshon ke bich vyapaar ko ek nayaa aayam milegaa or aarthik disha main badlaav ke liye ye ek bada kadam hoga
 Actually both the leaders have a feeling of their economic and social forces and they are going to be seen between the two on the negotiating table
 bharat or china kii badhati arthvyavastha par aaj duniya kii najar he or agar donon ke bich is disha main koi ahm samjhaute hue to phir donon kii aarthik takat ko ek nai urja milegi
 Issues like Doklam will also not be the case, Chinese media believe that there can be talks between the two leaders on the dispute like Doklam
 lekin isamen ye ahm ho saktaa he ki kisi tarah se donon desh simaaon par ek-duusare kii ahmiyat ko samajhe or takaraav kii sthiti ko harsambhav taalane kii koshish kii jaae
 Because the border dispute has a direct impact on the people of both countries and it also has a wide impact on trade

 The management committee had said that the bridge is 430 meters long and six meters wide

 The bridge is built between two rocks 300 meters above the ground
 samiti ke mutabik, pul ne apane adbhut dizin or nirmaan kii vajah se vishwa record banaae tha

 (input bhashaa se) Often our mothers give us advice to eat green vegetables
 jabaki hamamen se zyaadaatar logon ko subjiyan khaanaa pasand nahin hota or ham maa kii daant se bachane ke liye roj nae bahaane banaate rahete hai
 There is good news for such people
 ji haa, haal hi main kii gai ek study ne hamen solid bahaanaa jo de diya he
 According to a study published in the BBC, some vegetables have nothing to do with your test-buds, but they are directly related to your genes
 kentuki uniwarsity ke skool of medicin ke visheshgyon ke mutabik, "hamaare munh main alag-alag 25 swaad grahi hote hai
 Of these, the most research has been done on the test Bud TAS2R38, whose two variants are AVI and PAV
 ham main se 50 fisadi log vanshanukram se TAS2R38 ke donon verient AVI or PAV pate hai
 Such people feel both bitter and sweet
 saath hi ye visheshkar kadave swaad ke prati samvedansheel nahin hote hai
 At the same time, the other 25 percent people are called 'non tester', because such people have two copies of AVI
 non-testors kadave khaane ke prati zaraa bhi samvedansheel nahin hote hai
 Even such people find the food a bit sweet
 vahiin, antim 25 fisadi jinhen 'super testors' kaha jaataa he, unamem PAV kii do kapiyaan hoti hai
 Such people are more sensitive to bitter taste
 " vanshanukram se PAV kii do kapiyaan paane vaale logon ko broakeli, sprats, band gobhi, paalak or karele jaisi subjiyan bahut jyaad kadavi lagati hai
 Although these vegetables are rich in nutrients, but some people are unable to eat them due to their taste buds
 vahiin, food vaigyanikon kaa kahana he ki subjiyon ko puri tarah nakaar dena sehat ke liye acha nahin he
 Those who are unable to eat green leafy vegetables should try to eat them in a tasty manner to remove their bitterness
 connecticut uniwarsity kii professor vaileri daphi ke mutabik, "aapke andar kadave jeens kii do kapiyaan hai iskaa matlab yah nahin he ki aap subjiyon kaa majaa nahin le sakate hai
 Such food can be made fun by changing the cooking methods
 subjiyon main lahasun daalkar yaa unhen oven main roast karke uske kadavepan ko dur kar use swaadisht banaaya ja saktaa he
 Let us tell you that a total of 175 people participated in this survey
 survey main khulaasa hua ki jin logon main PAV jeens kii do kapiyaan hai ve kam hari subjiyan khate hai
 That is, if your mummy scolds you for green vegetables the next time, you can avoid them by asking them for their genes

 # duggadugga # birthdayparty a photo posted by Sushmita Sen (@sushmitasen47) on Aug 27, 2016 at 1:24pm PDT Senior batsman VVS Laxman may be under attack from critics due to his poor performance against Australia but he has no plans to retire
 reporton tathaa visheshgyon or purv cricketron kii kadi pratikriya ke vipareet ek saathi cricketer ne kaha, ‘lakshmana abhi sanyas nahin le rahaa he
 From what he has given us, it seems clear that if he retires, he will inform us about that long ago
 ’lakshmana ne mangalvaar ko vaaka kii nets par bhi spasht sanket diye ki unka abhi sanyas lene kaa iraadaa nahin he
 He practiced batting for long despite the scorching heat
 iske baad samvaadadaata sammelan main bhartiya salaami ballebaaj gautam gambhir ne bhi lakshmana kaa paksh liya
 He said, 'my question is why only one person? All seven of the top batsmen are guilty
 ham ikai ke taur par asafal rahe hai phir lakshmana ko hi bali kaa bakra kyon banaaya ja rahaa he?’ unhone kaha, ‘vah bhartiya cricket kaa mahaan khilaadi he
 He has been serving Indian cricket for a very long time
 kisi duusare ko unke bare main faisla karne kaa adhikaar nahin he
 Only and only they should have the right to decide about themselves
 ’gambhir ne kaha, ‘yadi aalochana ho rahi he to ek vyakti kii nahin balki puri ballebaaji ikai kii honi chahie jinhone team ko sharmasaar kiya
 The media, fans or former cricketers will not decide his retirement
 vah ab bhi kadi mehnat kar rahaa he
 There is only one innings and his confidence will return
 ’dhimi over gati ke liye ek match kaa pratibandh jhel rahe bhartiya captain mahendra singh dhoni se bhi jab lakshmana ke sanyas ke bare main poocha gaya tha, unhone kaha tha, ‘abhi tak mujhe aadhikarik taur par kuch bhi pataa nahin he
 If there is something big about me, then i would not like to answer it
 mujhe nahin pataa ki aisi baaten kahaan se aa rahi hai
 i don't want to speculate on this until Laxman himself comes and tells me
 ’lambey samay se lakshmana ke saathi rahul dravid bhi unke bachaav main aage aaye
 He said, 'I don't think he will be affected much by the talk of removing them
 maine aisa kuch nahin padhaa he or lakshmana bhi isse pareshaan nahin he
 This is part of our work
 jab aap lagaataar khelte rahete ho to aapako ise sweekaar karnaa hota he
 Is carried forward in a similar manner
 vah shant chit rahane vaala insaan he or mujhe ummid he ki vah acchhee vaapasi karegaa
 Laxman now has only one Test match left to prove himself
 unhone edilade main 2003 main 148 ran kii behtareen pari kheli thi
 Australia scored 556 runs but still had to face defeat due to the 303-run partnership between Laxman and Dravid
 lakshmana ne is maidan par vanade main bhi acha pradarshan kiya he
 He played the only ODI here against Zimbabwe in 2004 in which he scored 131 runs

 It is alleged that some families are sending their elders to the forest to hunt wild animals like tiger-bears
 shikaar hone ke baad agar laash jangal main milti he to koi sarkari muaavja nahin miltaa

 In the incidents that took place outside the forest, the forest department has given compensation of Rs 50 lakh
 iske alaava jila prashasan ne bhi krishak durghatana beemaa ke tahat muaavja diya he
 Suspicions of elderly animals being hunted by wild animals have also raised emphasis on a video going viral

 It is suspected that this was done so that the government could get compensation

 Among them, there are 8 incidents of getting freed when a corpse is found in a field or field

 According to the DFO, in some cases the villagers reached the village even before the Forest Department team arrived and the body was picked up, which is wrong

 co / dduw5wfagt(is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he
 It is published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) The two neighboring countries possessing nuclear weapons have gone through their most stressful phase in terrorism in the last two days in India and Pakistan
 bharat ne air strike kar pakistan kii jameen par palane vaale jaish-e-mohammad ke aatanki addon ko nasht kiya he
 On the other hand, in its retaliation, Pakistan claims that it has shot down two Indian aircraft and an Indian pilot is in its possession
 buudhvaar ko jab pakistani vimaan bhartiya seemaa main ghus aae to bhartiya vaayu sena ne tatkaal iskaa kadaa jawaab diya or ek pakistani vimaan ko maar giraaya
 The tensions which have reached the peak between the two countries now seem to be lessened by international intervention
 bharat javaabi karrwai kii ranneeti bana rahaa tha, isse dare pakistan main civil airports ko band kar diya gaya or kai shaharon main immergency jaise halaat ho gaye the
 Because of this, there was growing concern around the world
 sawaal yah uthta he ki donon deshon ke rishton main itani khatas kaise ai or tanaav itnaa zyada kaise bad gaya? isaki kya prishthbhumi he or kiski galati se rishte itane kharaab hue? aaie jaanate hai
 
 
 What triggered the current tension? On February 14, a suicide bomber attacked a CRPF convoy going to Srinagar in Kashmir, killing 40 soldiers
 pakistan se sakriy aatanki sanghathan jaish-e-mohammad ne is hamale kii jimmedaari lee thi
 The fidayeen attacker was a young man from Kashmir who was trained in Pakistan
 bharat sarkaar lambey samay se yah aarope lagaati rahi he ki pakistan aise aatanki sanghathanon ko apni jameen par palane kaa puraa mauka de rahaa he, lekin pakistan isse inkaar karata rahaa he
 In response to this, India on Tuesday conducted an airstrike on the land of Pakistan, which was described as pre-emptive action against the terrorist camps of Pakistan
 bharat ne kaha ki uske is hamale main saikadon aatanki maare gaye hai, jabaki pakistan kaa daawa tha ki bhartiya vimaanon ne 'jaldbaaji' main yah karrwai kii he or isse koi nuksaan nahin hua he
 Why is this tension dangerous? India and Pakistan have hundreds of nuclear weapons and both have conducted nuclear tests several times
 donon deshon ne parmaanu kshamta vaale mixilon kaa pareekshan kiya he
 India has accepted that it will not use nuclear weapons first, but Pakistan has been avoiding any such promise
 kaha jaataa he ki pakistan ne agar koi missile fire kiya to use bharat main pahunchane main sirf chaar minute lagenge
 The same situation will also be for missiles being released from India to Pakistan
 da bulatin of atomic scientist ne chetavanee di he ki bharat yaa pakistan main kisi bhi ek bade shahar par yadi ek bhi parmaanu hamalaa hua to uske parinaam bahut bhayaavah honge
 How did the Kashmir dispute start? In 1947, when Britain gave independence to this region, it divided the Indian continent into two countries
 hindu bahul desh bharat or lagbhag puri tarah muslim jansankhya vaala desh pakistan ban gaya
 More than 500 princely states merged in India
 lekin kashmir ek aisa muslim bahul ilaaka tha, jiske shaasha hindu the
 The Hindu king of Kashmir decided that he would go with India
 is par vivaad hua or isaki vajah se bharat-pakistan ke bich 1947 main pehali jang hui
 In 1949, the relationship between the two countries was normalized by a resolution of the United Nations and both armies settled along the Line of Control
 iske baad 1965 main kashmir ko lekar phir ek jang hui
 What happened after that, there was a third war between India and Pakistan in 1971 and East Pakistan split and became Bangladesh
 iske baad 1999-2000 main pakistani sena-aatankiyon ne kargil main ghuspaith kiya, jiske baad donon deshon main phir ek takaraav hua
 But this turned into a major war or a nuclear attack, before the matter was settled
 bharat or pakistan kii sena main ye he antarbharat main kareeb 130 karod log rahete hai
 India has a large army of about 14 lakh soldiers
 duusari taraf, pakistan kii jansankhya kareeb 20 karod he or uske paas 6
 There are 5 lakh soldiers
 donon deshon ne paramparaagat hathiyaaron par arabon dollar kaa nivesh kiya he
 According to the International Institute for Strategic Studies, last year Pakistan gave $ 11 billion, or about 3 of its GDP
 6 fisadi raashi pratiraksha par kharch kii he
 Similarly, India has $ 58 billion or 2 of GDP on immunity
 1 fisadi hissaa kharch kiya he
 In both countries, there was growing mass pressure
 In Pakistan, the army plays a very effective role
 haalanki, is baar puure maamle main rajanetaaon ne hi pratikriya di he
 Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi, after Tuesday's airstrike, described India as an attacker and said he would have to bear the consequences
 kuraishi ne piem narendra modi par aarope lagaaya tha ki vah chunaavon main phaayde ke liye kshetreey sthirataa se khel rahe hai
 anti-india protests took place everywhere in Pakistan and the atmosphere in the media there was fiercely against India
 bharat ne pulavama hamale kaa badla lene ke liye mangalvaar ko pakistan main ghuskar air strike kiya
 In response, when Pakistan also diverted its aircraft into the Indian border, a tremendous atmosphere was created against Pakistan across the country
 ek baar phir pakistan se badla lene ke liye baari jan dabaav banane laga
 Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat also said, 'truth and non-violence is fine, but the world has to explain India's strength
 'isse donon desh ek bade jang ke muhane par aa gaye or puri duniya main isko lekar chintaa badhane lagi
 The big countries of the world do not want the war between the two nuclear-rich countries to start, because once it starts, it will have a terrible end
 yahi nahin, puri duniya kii sthirataa ke liye bada khatra ban jaataa
 Recently, the big countries of the world, which have suffered huge economic recession, do not want to get caught in any such crisis again
 (samachar agency api ke input par aadhaarit) Pawar has started creating new political equations for power in Maharashtra
 ensipi se jude sutron ke mutabik sharad pavaar guuruuvaar ko nai dilli main bispi pramukh mayawati se mulaakaat kar sakate hai
 According to information received by India Today Group, Pawar is going to talk to the BSP about an alliance in the upcoming Maharashtra Assembly elections, because if this happens, the maratha-dalit vote bank can be brought together
 darasal, maharashtra ke dalit samudaay main mayawati kii party kii acchhee paith he
 Especially the vote percentage of BSP in Vidarbha is very good
 haalanki party ko ilaake main ek bhi seat nahin mili he, lekin mana jaataa he ki kshetra main bispi se congress-ensipi ke gathbandhan ko bahut nuksaan hua he
 In such a situation, if new political equations are formed in the state then the question also arises whether Pawar will leave the Congress
 Has achieved success in raising
 aise main kisi bhi gathbandhan ke liye vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan isamen send lagaana jaruri ho gaya he
 Sharad Pawar's move is also seen as an exercise in social engineering for the maratha-dalit vote
 ensipi maratha jati ke liye aarakshan ko lekar pehle se aawaaj buland kiye hue he jabaki sarkaar kaa kahana he ki vah aarakshan ke maamle se dur rahanaa chaahati he, kyonki isse obisi samudaay main galat sandesh jayega
 Atul Saluja, 45, who lives in Ghaziabad, UP, considers himself lucky
 kyonki jis aspataal main vah apana ilaaj kara rahe the, vahiin unhen nayaa jeevandaan ek aise marij kii badaulat mila jisaki dil kii dhadakanen tham gai thi
 Atul Saluja was in need of a liver transplant, so he was undergoing treatment at BL Kapoor Super Specialty Hospital, meanwhile a patient died of a cardiac attack in the hospital
 jiskaa liver atul saluja ko transplant kiya gaya
 Successful liver transplant after a cardiac attack for the first time In India, a liver of a dead person was transplanted into another person after a cardiac attack for the first time
 This is a unique case in itself because so far the claim is not being done by doctors is
 isse pehle jab bhi liver transplant kiya gaya to kisi jivit vyakti ne donnet kiya yaa phir ekbrain ded vyakti kaa liver transplantkar duusare marij ko nai jindagi di gai
 But the doctors of the hospital transplanted the liver of a dead person to a needy person after cardiac death in just 30 minutes
 aspataal ke senior canceltent or diarector dow sanjay singh negi ke mutabik, 'cardiyak atake se hui deth ke baad liver main blad cirkulation thodi der ke liye ruuk jaataa he, jisase utakon main oxigen kii kami ho jaati he
 Such stage is called ischemia in medical language
 jisaki avadhi liver ke cese main maatr 30 minute hoti he jabaki kidney transplant ke liye ye avadhi kareeb 2 ghante kii hoti he
 'if the liver of a cardiac death patient is not transplanted to another body within 30 minutes, then the liver fails, then it cannot be used or say that the liver is no longer useful
 doctoron ke mutabik, kai baar cardiyak deth ke baavjood mrit vyakti kaa liver jaruratmand vyakti tak nahin pahunch paata kyonki yaa to mrit vyakti ke parijan organ donneton ke liye taiyaar nahin hote yaa phir aise liver ko transplant karne ke liye ek aspataal se duusare aspataal le janaa padataa he jiske liye 30 minute kaa samay kaaphi kam he
 The special thing is that in case of liver transplant, there is no need to find matching, therefore, patients whose death is due to cardiac attack or due to some reason in the hospital, their families must donate liver and other organisms to help the needy
 Could
 aapako bataa den ki bharat main 1
 Less than 5 thousand kidney transplants are performed every year against an estimated requirement of over 75 lakh
 isi prakaar desh main har saal keval ek hajaar liver hi transplant kiye jate hai jabaki desh main kareeb 50 hajaar se zyada log liver kii beemaari ke vajah se apni jaan ganvaa dete hai
 Likewise, about 50 thousand cases a year for heart transplant, there are 20 thousand cases annually for lung, but if we talk about organ donation, then the rate of organ donation in India is only 3 lakh
 footbal ke is mahayuddh main kai khilaadi aise hai jinpar sari duniya kii nigahen hai or un par unke desh kii ummiden tiki hui hai

 Messi is considered to be the most genius player in the football world

 This is a record that hardly anyone can break

 All eyes are on the host Brazilian fast bowler Neymar
 mana jaataa he ki is world cap main sabase zyada ummiden isi khilaadi se he
 Last year, he played an important role in defeating the world-class Spain to his team
 uske kaushal or jazbe ko dekhte hue kaha ja rahaa he ki vah brazil ko yah world cap dilaa saktaa he
 Brazilian left-back player Marcello has similar expectations
 use duniya kaa sabase badhiya left back mana ja rahaa he
 He is not only good in defense but also in attack
 uski dribling darshakon ko divaana bana detii he
 He is desperate to get his country this magnificent cup for the sixth time
 brazil kaa central back thiago silva bhi un khilaadiyon main he jis par sari duniya kii nigahen hai
 Silva is the captain of his team and will fight to win it
 vah har taraf se khel saktaa he
 His own team's right-back Danis Alves is the world's best right-back
 gend uske kadamon main gumti rah jaati he or sabhi dekhte rah jate hai
 World champion Spain captain Iker Casillas is considered the world's best goalkeeper
 duniya ke bade se bade khilaadi ke shot ko roak lene kii uski kshamta ne uski team ko bulandiyon par pahunchaaya he
 Along with this, Andres Iniesti of his team is considered the world's best mid fielder
 us jaisaa dribler to shaayad hi koi ho
 He can penetrate every type of defense
 italy ke midfilder andrei pirlo ko bhala kaise nazarandaaj kiya ja saktaa he? gend ek baar uske paas aa jaae to aasaani se koi usase chin nahin saktaa
 Netherlands player Aaren Robben is also a midfielder who makes a mark in the field
 vah khilaadiyon ke hujum se gend nikaal kar gol kar saktaa he
 If his teammates take advantage of him, then his team can do anything
 germany ke anbhavi khilaadi philip lam ko kam karke aankna to badi bhul hogi
 After becoming the captain of his team, his game has improved further
 usne kai mahatvapurn avasaron par gol kiye hai
 All eyes will be on the performance of the German player Close

 cricket itihaas ke sabase bade gendbaaj ne 9 saal pehle aaj hi (22 july ko) test cricket kaa adbhut record apane naam kiya tha

 Grabbing Pragyan Ojha at the hands of Mahela Jayawardene, he touched the magic figure of 800 wickets
 or iske saath hi unhone test cricket main apni antim gend par wicket hasil kar richard hadlee kii barabari kar lee

 The press conference convened to favor the Congress party on the Baba Ramdev issue created a furore when one of the crowd of journalists stepped up to party leader Janardan Dwivedi

 Journalists caught the man and handed him over to the police
 isse pehle conference main congress netaa dvivedi ne baba ramdev par hamalaa bolte hue kaha tha ki satyagrahi chori-chori nahin bhaagta
 It is wrong to compare Baba Ramdev to Gandhiji

 The Congress leader says that satyagraha is not meant to create pressure
 is puri ghatana par congress party ke mahasachiv digvijay singh ne kaha ki yah harakat aresas, viechpi or paroksh main bhaajapa kii he
 On the statement of Congress leader Digvijay Singh on the differences between the top investigative agencies of the country like CBI, IB and NIA in Ishrat Jahan encounter case, BJP said that the Home Ministry really needs to clarify this
 party kii pravaktaa nirmala sitaraman ne kaha ki vivaadon par digbhramit karne main maahir digvijay ne haalanki ukt bayaan bhi maamle ko nayaa pech dene ke iraade se diya he, lekin bijepi bhi chaahati he ki kendriya jaanch beuro, khufia beuro or rashtriya jaanch agency ke bich ishrat jahaan maamle ko lekar jo paraspar virdohi rukh he use spasht kiya jaae
 He said that the Ministry of Home Affairs should also clarify why and in whom the 2007 affidavit in the Ishrat Jahan case was changed in 2009
 sitaraman ne kaha ki bijepi ke varisht netaa or rajyasabha main netaa pratipaksh arun jetali bahut pehle kah chuke hai ki grih mantralay, khufia beuro, enie or sibiai jaisi suraksha agenciyon ko lekar ‘vishwaas kii kami’ kaa maahaul vyaapt he, kyonki inkaa congress raajnneeti ke liye istemaal karti he
 He alleged that the Congress is misusing the CBI to run false propaganda against the Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi and the former Minister of State for Home Amit Shah in the Ishrat Jahan case too
 unhone kaha, ‘is maamle main raajnneeti ek mukhya vajah he
 BJP demanded that the Home Ministry also clarify whether that paragraph has been removed from the NIA report which said that the Mumbai terror attack conspirator and lashkar-e-taiba operative David Headley Had confirmed that Ishrat Jahan was operative of this organization
 bijepi pravaktaa ne kaha, ‘ishrat jahaan maamle main sibiai ke aarope patr main jawaab milane se adhik sawaal khadey hue hai
 Is it based on the information given by the Home Ministry to the CBI or on the evidence gathered in the search of the investigating agency? Or is the CBI collecting evidence but the charge sheet is doing the things given by the Ministry of Home Affairs? He said that according to the rules, the IB shares the information collected with the Prime Minister's Office
 agar usne ishrat jahaan sambandhi soochnaaon ko pradhanmantri karyaalay se saajha kiya he to piemo kii chuppi maamle ko sulajhane main madadgaar nahin hogi

 Ishrat was killed nine years ago in an alleged fake encounter in Gujarat
 unhone kaha ki enie, ibi or sibiai ne is mudde par alag-alag bayaan diye hai
 Singh said, 'NIA is saying something, IB is saying something and CBI is saying something else

 He has revealed that Chappell came to his house and told him that together we can rule Indian cricket for years
 tendulkarne 2005 se 2007 ke bich team india ke coach rahe chapel kii kadi aalochana karte hue unhen ‘ringamaster’ qaraar diya, jo khilaadiyon par apane vichaar thopata tha
 According to Tendulkar, Chappell did not care at all whether the players were comfortable with his behavior
 dravid kii jagah unhen captain banane kii coach kii koshish par tendulkar ne vistaar se likhaa he, ‘vishwa cap se kuch maheene pehle chapel mere ghar aae or suzav diya ki mujhe rahul dravid se captaini le leni chahie
 'he wrote,' Anjali was also sitting with me and she was also surprised to hear that 'together we can control Indian cricket for years
 or vah team kii captaini hasil karne main meri madad karenge
 Tendulkar wrote, "I was surprised that the coach is showing little respect for the captain, while cricket's biggest tournament is to be held after a few months
" ’ is star ballebaaj ne kaha ki unhone chapel kaa suzav sire se khaarij kar diya
 'he stayed for two hours, kept trying to convince me and finally left
 ’agle pej par padhein: 2007 world cap ke bare main sachin kaa khulaasa2007 world cap ke bare main sachinatendulkar ne board ko suzav diya ki senior khilaadi team par niyantran rakh sakate hai or team ko ekajute rakh sakate hai
 He wrote in his book, 'this did not happen and the 2007 campaign ended in a terrible fate
 ’ team india keval ek match bermuda ke khilaaf jeet pai, bangladesh or srilanka se haar kaa munh dekhnaa padaa
 Taking a dig at Chappell, Tendulkar said that the Australians should have taken too much responsibility for India's disappointing performance in the World Cup
 unhone likhaa he, ‘mujhe nahin lagata ki main isse bahut dur tha jab main kahata ki adhiktar khilaadiyon ko lagata he ki chapel ke rahete hue bhartiya cricket kisi bhi disha main aage nahin bad rahaa tha
 'tendulkar has written in his book that Chappell was publicly questioning our commitment and making matters worse rather than giving us a fresh start
 ’ tendulkar ke saath yah kitaab mashhoor khel patrkaar or itihasvid boria majumdaar ne likhi he
 The star batsman said that many senior players were relieved at Chappell's departure, "this did not surprise anyone because whatever the reason was, he did not treat them properly
" ’tendulkar ne likhaa he, ‘eemaandaaree se kahen to saurav bharat ke sarvshereshth cricketron main se ek he or unhen team kaa hissaa banane ke liye chapel ke samarthan kii jarurat nahin thi
 Tendulkar said that Chappell wanted the senior players out of the team
 agle pej par padhein: chapel ne lakshmana ko di dhamkee
 
 
 When Chappell threatened Laxman, Tendulkar wrote, "it seemed that Chappell intended to exclude all the senior players and in the process damaged the harmony of the team
" ek maukey par unhone vivies lakshmana se kaha ki vah pari kii shuruyaat karne par vichaar karen
 Laxman politely denied it and said that he had tried to start the innings in the early part of his career, as he was in a dilemma at the time, but now he was frozen in the middle order and Greg was given the middle order
 Should have considered him as a batsman
 ’tendulkar ne lakshmana vaale maamle main aage likhaa, ‘greg ke jawaab ne ham sabhi ko hatprabh kar diya
 He told Laxman that he should be cautious as it would not be easy to return at the age of 32
 ’ is diggaj ballebaaj ne likhaa he, ‘asal main mujhe baad main pataa chalaa ki greg ne bisisiai se senior khilaadiyon ko hataane ke bare main baat kii thi
 There is no doubt that he did this with the hope of reshaping the team
 ’bharat ratna sachin tendulkar ne purv australian coach kii achche samay main charchaa main bane rahane or bure daur main khilaadiyon ko majdhaar main chhodane kii aadat kii bhi aalochana kii
 Tendulkar recalled how disappointed he was after being eliminated in the first round of the 2007 World Cup and how hurt he was when people questioned the players' commitment
 unhone likhaa he, ‘jab ham bharat laute, to mediakarmi mere saath ghar tak aae or jab maine suna ki mere apane log khilaadiyon kii patibaddhta par andeh kar rahe hai to isse dukh hua
 The media had every right to criticize our failure, but to say that our focus was not on work was not right
 ’tendulkar ne likhaa he, ‘ham prashansakon kii apekshaaon par khare nahin utar paae the, lekin iskaa matlab yah nahin tha ki hamen deshadrohi kaha janaa chahie
 The reactions were surprisingly highly hostile at times and some players were concerned about their safety
 ’ tendulkar ne kaha ki 2007 world cap kii haar ke baad unke dimag main sanyas lene kaa vichaar aayaa, lekin parijanon or doston ne unhen bane rahane ke liye kaha
 He wrote, 'andulkar, like titles were very hurtful
 antarrashtriya cricket main 18 saal bitaane ke baad is tarah kii chizon ko sahan karnaa mushkil tha or sanyas kaa vichaar mere dimag main aayaa tha
 My family and friends like Sanjay Nayak tried their best to keep me happy and after a week i decided to do something about it
 maine daudna shuru kiya
 It was an attempt to extract the memories of the World Cup from the mind
 ’antarrashtriya cricket main dheron record banane ke baad 2013 main khel ko alavida kehane vaale sachin tendulkar ne do dashak se zyada ke apane kariyar ke ahm lamhon ko ujagar kiya he, jisamen unka bura daur bhi shaamil he
 Tendulkar's autobiography 'playing it My Way' is to be released worldwide on November 6, in which the legendary batsman also mentions the frustration during his tenure as captain

 desh ke sabase bade raajnneetik parivaar se aane vaale sanjay gandhi kii dosti doon skool main pashchim bengal se aane vaale kamalnath se hui
 The friendship started from Doon School gradually became family
 doon skool se padhai karne ke baad kamalnath kolkata ke saint jevier college pahunche
 Even after changing the city, there was not much distance between the two friends
 kamalnath purv piem indira gandhi ke daur se hi gandhi parivaar ke kareebi rahe hai
 Kamal Nath wanted to grow his business
 aise main ek baar phir doon skool ke ye donon dost phir kareeb aa gaye
 It is said that during the Emergency period, when the company of Kamal Nath was running in crisis, Sanjay Gandhi played an important role in removing it from it
 sanjay gandhi ke behad kareebi the kamalnathkamalnath, sanjay gandhi ke saath har vakt rahete the
 Elder son Rajiv Gandhi did not wish to enter politics
 aise main sanjay gandhi ko jarurat ek aise shaks kii thi jo har vakt saath dene ke liye taiyaar rahe
 Kamal Nath emerged as such a companion for Sanjay Gandhi
 1975 main immergency ke baad se congress kharaab daur se guzar rahi thi
 Sanjay Gandhi had died prematurely during this period, Indira Gandhi's age was also not supporting her now
 sanjay gandhi 23 june, 1980 ko vimaan haadase kaa shikaar ho gaye the or unki maut ho gai thi
 Congress continued to weaken
 kamalnath gandhi parivaar ke kareeb aa hi chuke the, ve lagaataar mehnat bhi kar rahe the
 He constantly stood with the party
 iskaa inaam unhen indira gandhi ne diya jab unhen chhindwara seat se tikat diya or raajnneeti main utaar diya
 Kamal Nath has been active in politics since then and is one of the veteran leaders of Congress
 kamalath ke samarthak jaanate hai ki chhindwara ab congress kaa aisa majboot garh he, jahaan bijepi bhi paanv nahin pasaar paa rahi he
 Team India's star fast bowler Mohammed Shami said on Wednesday that the Indian team has a special plan for the upcoming series against Australia
 shami ne haalanki mana he ki australian team majboot he, isliye use 5-0 se haraana mushkil hoga
 Australia is currently on a tour to India, where they will play five odis, one-day series and three T20 matches
 shami ne kaha, "australia kaaphi majboot team he
 We cannot take them lightly
 hamaare paas unako lekar ranneetiyaan hai, jinhen main yahaan nahin bataa saktaa
 "shami and Umesh Yadav were given rest on the recent Sri Lanka tour, not choosing the team
 in donon ne australia ke khilaaf hone vaali siries ke pehle teen maichon ke liye chuni gai team main vaapasi kii he
 He said Australia captain Steven Smith and David Warner could pose problems
 shami ne kaha, "donon vishwa str ke ballebaaj hai
 We also have a strategy for them
 is tarah ke ballebaajon ke saamne gendbaaji karnaa aasaan nahin hota he
 Australia is stronger than ever, but we will focus on our strengths
 "roteshan policy ke tahat chayankartaaon ne team ke do pramukh spin gendbajonravichandran asvinaur rabindra jadeja ko aaraam diya he
 To this Shami said, "this is a good thing
 agar ahm khilaadiyon ko kuch dinon ke liye aaraam diya jaataa he, to isse unhen apane aap ko or majboot karne kaa samay miltaa he
 " bharat or afghanistan ke bich kareebi sambandh pakistan ke maathe kii sican ban gaye hai
 Pakistan said on Thursday that no cooperation between the two countries should be against their country
 pakistani videsh mantralay ke vikali press conference main afghanistan ko bhartiya hathiyaaron kii aapurti sambandhi sawaal ke jawaab main, mantralay ke pravaktaa nafis jakaaria ne kaha, 'aisa koi sahyog pakistan ke liye hanikaarak nahin hona chahie
 'india has supplied four Mi-25 helicopters to Afghanistan and is also training Afghan forces
 karaji ne kii thi PAK kii aalochanajakaaria kii tippanee aise samay ai he, jabaki kuch hi din pehle hi afghanistan ke purv raashtrapatihamid karajine kaha tha ki bharat, afghanistan main kisi chhadam yuddh main shaamil nahin he
 He said that India is doing reconstruction work there
 karaji ne kattarpanth ko badhaava dene or uski jameen se gatividhiyaan chalaa rahe aatankwaadi samoohon ko niyantrit nahin karne par pakistan kii aalochana kii thi
 'negotiations are the only way' on Thursday, spokesman Zakaria said that Pakistan has been emphasizing that the only practical solution to the Afghan issue will be found after political negotiations
 radio pakistan kii khabar ke mutabik, jakaaria ne kaha ki afgaan sarkaar ko mail-milaap ke sambandh main spasht sandesh dena chahie or iske liye protsaahan bhi dena chahie
 a passport or driving license, mobile SIM or admission to college, Aadhaar card is required in every department
 desh ke har naagarik ke liye aadhaar card anivaary ban gaya he
 But its usefulness does not end here
 gharon se bichade bacchon ko bhi aadhaar dobaaraa parijanon ke paas pahunchane ke liye bhi ‘aadhaar’ kaa kaam kar rahaa he
 Something similar happened in Chhapra in Bihar
 chhapra ke balgrih main rah rahe 9 bacchon ko aadhaar card kii madad se unke gharavaalon ko saunpa gaya
 All these children had wandered from other parts of the country to Chhapra and were living here in Balgriha
 kuch bachche to dhai saal se bhi adhik samay se yahaan rah rahe the
 Actually, the Aadhar card is made by the administration of every child living in the child's home
 jab in bacchon kaa card banwaaya ja rahaa tha to pataa chalaa ki inke aadhaar card pehle se hi bane hue hai
 The Children's Home Management removed the old details of the base of the children and contacted their family members
 bihar ke samaaj kalyaan nideshak raaj kumaar kii upasthiti main saaran jila prashasan ne guuruuvaar ko 9 bacchon ko unke gharavaalon ko saunpa
 There were tears of joy in the eyes of the child and the parents where they met again
 prashasan kior se bacchon ko uphaar die gaye
 His family members were also honored with Angavastram
 samaaj kalyaan nideshak raaj kumaar ne kaha ki in bacchon ke unke gharavaalon se dobaaraa milane se pataa chalata he ki aadhaar card hamaare jivan main kitna upyogi he
 Saran Deputy Development Commissioner Roshan Kushwaha was also present on the occasion
 kaledhan ke mudde par baba ramdev ne guuruuvaar ko upie kii sahyogi party areldi ke pramukh or kendriya uddyan mantri ajit singh se mulaakaat kar is mudde par unka samarthan maanga
 Ajit Singh said that Ramdev's campaign is not political and he only wants the immediate return of black money from abroad
 tippaniyan Ajit said that Babaji is making people aware on the issue of black money and it is not a question of any party
 isse pehle ramdev ensipi netaa sharad pavaar se bhi mili the
 Baba Ramdev says that he will meet leaders of all major parties to seek support on the issue of black money
 unhone sonia gandhi se milane ke liye samay bhi maanga he
 When NDTV asked Ramdev if he would talk about bringing back the black money of Bofors, he said that all kinds of black money would be discussed
 in mulakaaton ko lekar congress mahasachiv digvijay singh ne ramdev kii aalochana kii he
 At the same time, Shiv Sena supremo Bal Thackeray has also targeted Ramdev in the party mouthpiece 'saamana'
 bal thakare ne likhaa he ki ek taraf netaaon kii niyat par sawaal uthaanaa or duusari taraf unase milakar samarthan maangana kitna sahi he
 'saamana' has written in Bal Thackeray that it is a joke to meet Sharad Pawar and ask for support to Baba Ramdev on the issue of bringing back Baba Ramdev's black money
 ajit ne kaha ki babaaji logon ko kaledhan ke mudde par jaagruk kar rahe hai or yah kisi party kaa sawaal nahin he
 Earlier Ramdev also met NCP leader Sharad Pawar
 baba ramdev kaa kahana he ki vah sabhi pramukh partiyon ke netaaon se milakar kaledhan ke mudde par samarthan maangenge
 He has also sought time to meet Sonia Gandhi
 enditivi ne ramdev se poocha ki kya vah boforce ke kaale dhan ko waapas laane kii baat karenge, to unhone kaha ki har tarah ke kaale dhan par baat hogi
 Ramdev has been criticized by Congress General Secretary Digvijay Singh for these meetings
 vahiin, shivasena supremeo bal thakare ne bhi party ke mukhpatr 'saamana' main ramdev par nishaanaa saadhaa he
 Bal Thackeray has written how right it is to question the intentions of the leaders on the one hand and meet them and seek support on the other side
 'saamana' ne bal thakare main likhaa he ki baba ramdev kaa kalaadhan waapas laane ke mudde par sharad pavaar se milakar samarthan maangana or pavaar kaa baba ramdev ko samarthan dena ek majaak he
 Ramdev has been criticized by Congress General Secretary Digvijay Singh for these meetings

 Gujarat CM Narendra Modi did not miss out on sharing of Guru Gyan on the occasion of Teacher's Day
 ek sawaal ke jawaab main modi ne kaha ki ve piem banane kaa sapana nahin dekhte hai
 He went a step further and said that the dreamers are doomed
 darasal, narendra modi shikshak diwas ke maukey par schuli bacchon se mulaakaat kar rahe the
 During this time, he was asked whether he would meet the children even after becoming the Prime Minister? On this sudden question, Modi replied without losing time that he does not have such dreams
 unhone bacchon ko naseehat dene ke lahaze main kaha ki kuch karne kii bajaae keval sapane dekhne vaale barbaad ho jaaya karte hai
 He said, 'always think of doing something, because similar thinking works
 'gauratlab he ki narendra modi agle chunaav ke liye bijepi kii abhiyaan samiti ke pramukh banaae gaye hai
 There is a possibility that Modi will be made the prime ministerial candidate from the BJP in the general election
 haalanki is masale par philhal party ke bheetar hi bade netaa ekamat najar nahin aa rahe hai
 Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh Shivraj Singh Chauhan has also come out in his favor after the Rajput community's protest on the film Padmavati
 unhone na sirf apane soobe main film kii relies ko bain karne kii ghoshnaa kii he, balki rani padmavati ko rashtramata kaa darja bhi de diya he
 Now going beyond this, he is also going to include Padmavati prominently in the education system
 buudhvaar ko shivaraj singh chouhan ne ghoshnaa kii he ki chittod kii rani padmavati ke paath ko agle shaikshanik satr se paathyakram main shaamil kiya jayega
 He made this announcement at a program of Rajput Samaj in Ujjain
 rajput samaaj ke netaaon ne yah kaarykram mukhyamantri chouhan ko film nirmaataa sanjay lila bhansaali kii vivaadaaspad film 'padmavati' kii relies ko madhyapradesh main pratibandh lagane ke liye sammanit karne ke liye yojit kiya tha
 Shivraj said this
 During this time Shivraj Singh said, 'the whole life of Rajmata Padmavati can know the character, her sacrifice, penance and valor for generations to come, so from the next session her character will be included in the syllabus, so that the correct history will be passed on to the generation and People can know
 'isse pehle somvaar ko chouhan ne bhopal main ghoshnaa kii thi ki yadiaitihaasik tathyon ke saath khilwaadkar rani padmavati ke sammaan ke khilaaf film 'padmavati' main drishy rakhe gaye to ise madhyapradesh main relies kii parmishan nahin di jaaegi
 Along with this, Chauhan had said that a memorial of Rani Padmavati will be built in the proposed Veer Bhoomi project in Bhopal in memory of the heroes of the country
 ek aisa desh jahaan par cinema nahin dekha jaataa he, coffee house main sirf purush hi ja sakate hai vahaan shahi parivaar ke ek sadsy ne ab kuch alag hatakar kaam karne kaa faisla kiya he taaki samaaj main mahilaon ko aage badhaayaa ja sake
 Her endeavor is to connect women with maximum employment and change their social life
 saudi arab ke dipti crown prince mohammad bin salmaan (31) maananaa he ki ab samay aa gaya he ki yahaan ki mahilaon ko aage badhaayaa jaae or unako bhi rudhivadita se nikaalkar aazaadee se jeene kaa aadhikaar diya jaae
 Every year people of Saudi Arabia spend millions and crores of rupees going abroad and have fun, but there is no freedom of all these things in their own country
 desh ko badalte aadhunik soch se jodne or paramparaon se mukt karne ke liye dipti crown prince ne ek vijan taiyaar kiya he jise 2030 tak lagu kiye jane ki koshish he
 Prince is trying to make some more changes in Saudi Arabia's economy as it is dependent on oil
 unka sapana he ki aane vaale dashak main saudi arab kii chhavi puri duniya main badal jaae
 The special thing is that while most people of the royal family have studied from western countries, Prince Salman has studied in Saudi Arabia itself, but his thinking is very open-minded
 unka kahana he ki agar desh main log chhuttiyon main ghumenge, masti karenge to unke kaam karne kii kshamta main ijapha ho jayega
 Prince's thinking matches Western and developed countries
 haalanki kuch rudhivaadee logon ne prince kaa virodh bhi kiya he
 Recently some music concerts have been organized inside Saudi, which has also been advised by people
 unka kahana tha ki aise aayojan main is baat kaa dhyaan rakhana he ki kahin vah pashchimi sabhyataa se prabhavit to nahin he or hamaare 'saudi mulyon' kaa hanan to nahin kar rahe hai
 Let us tell you that some such music concerts have been allowed in Saudi in recent times

 Be it Robben Island in South Africa, where Nelson Mandela lived in prison or Andaman's Cellular Jail, all of them are visiting in large numbers
 ab is tarah kaa tourism mumbai main bhi shuru hone ja rahaa he
 Maharashtra government is going to open its jails to the general public soon
 department se jude adhikari 'jail tourism policy' par kaam kar rahe hai, jiske tahat kuch jelon ko aam loga ke liye kholane kii yojana he
 Officials said that before implementing this scheme, they will also have to make strong security arrangements
 prakruti kii god main len chhuttiyon kaa majaabata den kimaharashtra main30 jail hai lekin ye sabhi paryatakon ke liye nahin kholi jaaengi
 Only those jails, which have some heart-warming history, will be opened under this scheme

 For this, certain days of the week and limited hours will be fixed
 hamen yah bhi dhyaan rakhana hoga ki in jelon main kuch serial kilors, aatankwaadi or celibrities bhi kaid hai
 So people will definitely want to roam here, but we have to strengthen their security
 'khubasurat Beaches ke bich ye goa bhi jarur dekhen aap
 
 
 Let us tell you that there are some prisons in Maharashtra which have historical importance as well
 jaise yarvada jail main gandhi, nehru, bal gangadhar tilak, vir saavarkar ne aazaadee kii ladaai ke dauraan jail kaati thi
 Recently, Sanjay Dutt was also imprisoned here
 bihar main bijepi ke satta se alag hone ke baad aparaadhon main kami ai he jabaki bijepi lagaataar ye aarope lagaati rahi he ki jab se janata dal you se unka gathbandhan tutaa he tab se bihar main kanoon vyavastha kii sthiti kharaab ho gai he
 But the National Crime Records Bureau data shows that there has been a decrease in crimes in Bihar
 janata dal you ke rashtriya mahasachiv or bihar sarkaar main khaadya evam upabhokta maamalon ke mantri shyaam rajak ne bijepi kii kadi aalochana karte hue kaha ki bihar main na sirf aparaadhon main kami ai he balki desh main jitne bhi bijepi shasit rajya hai unamem se bihar main sabase kam aparaadhik maamle darj hue hai
 On 16 June 2013, the 17-year alliance of Janata Dal u and BJP came to an end in Bihar
 tab se bijepi nitish sarkaar par lagaataar hamale kar rahi he
 Although he remained with them for seven and a half years, he did not see any shortage, but after separation, he started seeing all kinds of flaws in the government
 bijepi ne sabase zyada hamalaa kanoon vyavastha ko lekar bolaa kyonki unke alag hote hi bihar ke bodhgaya or patna main pehali baar aatanki hamale hue, mid de mile cond hua or kuch jagahon par sampradayik tanaav bhi hue
 And this is also true
 lekin saath-saath dusre aparaadhon par niyantran bhi rahaa
 According to data from the National Crime Bureau, 313 murder cases were registered in June, the month of which the alliance ended, while 299 cases of murder were reported in August after separation
 isi tarah se june main balaatkaar ke 102 maamle aae to agast main iskaa aankada 81 kaa rahaa
 There were 515 kidnapping cases in June and 481 cases in August
 yahi nahin shyaam rajak ne ye bhi aarope lagaaya he ki mahilaon par ho rahe aparaadhik maamlo main bhi bihar bijepi shasit rajyon gujarat chhattisgarh or madhya pradesh se kaaphi kam he
 In 2012, the average rate of crime per one lakh women is 23 in Bihar
 41 pratishat he, gujarat main ye badhkar 33
 Chhattisgarh has 34 percent and Madhya Pradesh has the highest percentage of 47 percent
 75 pratishat he
 Not only this, in the last year i
e
 in 2012, during the tenure of BJP which was in power of neighboring state Jharkhand 29
 16 pratishat rahi jo bihar ke 23
 Is more than 41 percent
 shyaam rajak ne kaha ki jab 2005 main nitish kumaar kii sarkaar bani to us samay bihar main aparaadh or aparaadhiyon kaa bolbalaa tha, lekin good gavarnence kii badaulat aparaadh or aparaadhiyon par nakel kase gaye
 The result was in 2005 where 3423 murders, 1191 robberies, 2379 robberies, 251 kidnapping for ransom, 973 rape incidents took place
 vahiin 2012 main hatya ke 3066, dakaiti ke 540, lut ke 1266, phiroti ke liye apharan ke 70, balaatkaar ke 927 maamle saamne aae jo ki 2005 se kam hai
 JDU claims that Bihar has the largest population of BJP ruled states
 yani gujarat se dedh guna se bhi zyada
 Despite this, in 2012, where 160271 cognizable offenses were registered in Bihar, in Gujarat more than twice the number was 362649, in Madhya Pradesh 324845 and in Chhattisgarh 318615
 shyaam rajak kaa kahana he ki in rajyon main prati lakh vyakti par police kii sankhya bhi zyada he
 There are 67 police personnel per one lakh population in Bihar, 174 in Chhattisgarh, 114 in Gujarat and 104 in Madhya Pradesh
 bihar ke khaadya aapurti mantri shyaam rajak ne kaha ki bijepi ke netaa galat aankade jutakar ye sabit karne main lage hai ki unke hatane ke baad bihar main aparaadhiyon kaa bolbalaa badha he lekin hakeekat usase bilkul ulat he
 He said that ever since Bijpi came out of power, there has been a decrease in crimes like murder, rape, maiming, loot and rioting in Bihar, so BJP leaders should not be confused
 pahalwani karne vaale mulaayam ne kai maukon par siyaasi diggajon ko patkhni di he
 Many leaders of the Third Front like Charan Singh, VP Singh, Chandrasekhar, Sonia Gandhi, Mamta Banerjee have lost their hands

 The soccer of politics is something Mulayam's son Akhilesh Yadav has been fond of playing football
 apni chhavi ko lekar khaas khyaal rakhte rahe hai
 Perhaps believing in this, the pair of Rahul and Priyanka have brought the issue of synergy in UP
 vaise ghutane main chot lagane se pehle rahul bhi footbal khelaa karte the
 In the field of politics also, the two young leaders joined the BJP and BSP in the political field and started preparing for the goal
 rahul ko nahin tha jeet kaa bharosaayun to rahul prachaar ke liye apni team lekar devaria se dilli kii yatra par nikle the
 During this time, those farmers were filling up the loan form and shouting the slogan '27 years, UP Behala'
 shila dikshit ko siem ummidavaar banaakar bramhan voton ko waapas bula rahe the
 But he was constantly feeling that he could not stand ahead of the strong team of BJP and BSP
 tabhi rahul ne akhilesh ke netritv main apni team ko bijepi or basapa ke saamne utaarne kaa man bana liya
 It did not take long for the 'captaincy' Congress handed over to Akhilesh to declare that in this political match, Akhilesh will play forward and the Congress will back him
 party ne akhilesh yadav ko apni ghoshit captain shila dikshit se behatar bataate hue khud maidan chhod diya
 When everything was decided according to the wishes of the Chief Minister, then the matter got stuck on the selection of the players who entered the election field
 footballar akhilesh kaa daandhkhilesh apni team main rahul kii ichha ke mutabik logon ko edjust nahin kar paa rahe the
 In such a situation, football enthusiast Akhilesh took the political stakes of his father's wrestling
 shuruaati jatke ne to rahul ko maano chaunkaa hi diya
 Akhilesh announced his team just before the match
 kai khilaadi team rahul ke siyaasi khiladiyon kii pojishan par bhi utaare gaye
 Akhilesh had already given a message to the people of UP and the Muslim voters that the Congress in UP is their support
 saath hi ye bhi ki wo majbooti se siyaasi match main utar rahe hai tabhi congress unki team se milane ko taiyaar hui
 He intelligently threw the ball into the Congress court
 ab rahul gandhi ko ye faisla karnaa he ki wo jis akhilesh ko apni saajha team kaa captain bana chuki he, unhen hi team chunane kaa adhikaar bhi de
 Overall, Akhilesh has proved that even though he is knowledgeable about football, he also uses the political bets of his father's wrestling when the opportunity arises
 vahiin footbal ke hi jaankaar rahul gandhi agar ab saajha team nahin bana paae to un par self gol karne kaa iljaam lagegaa
 Akhilesh, who forcibly took the captaincy from his father, would face a double charge if he landed in the UP political match alone and lost
 ek to pita kii naa sunne kaa or doosraa rahul se dagabaaji kaa
 Now the match is just about to begin
 dekhnaa he ki team akhilesh or team congress upi main saajha team utaarte hai yaa nahin
 Lallan Singh in his brief speech gave reasons why his party does not currently support the Bharatiya Janata Party's move
 unhone kaha ki bhartiya janata party ke saath gathbandhan or neshnal agenda of gavarnence bana tha
 It was agreed not to tamper with these controversial issues, the witness of which is Defense Minister Rajnath Singh and Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad in the House today
 is prishthbhumi main party apane puraane rukh par ab bhi kaayam he
 If the central government takes any step against terrorism, their party will have full support on it
 lalan singh ne kaha ki desh main ek aisa daur tha khaskar 2013-2014 ke bich jab aatankwaad kii ghatnaayen niyamit rup se hoti thim or sadan main bhi is par charchaa hoti thi
 It was pledged that steps would be taken to prevent such incidents from recurring
 singh ne kaha ki yah bhi ek kadava sach he ki aatankwaad kaa centre jammu-kashmir rahaa he or usamen khaad or pani dene kaa kaam pakistan karata he
 But it is also true that after 2014, the Prime Minister Narendra Modi government has been formed, the incidence of terrorism has come down
 baad main lalan singh ne kaha ki haal main centre sarkaar ne aatankwaad se nipatane ke liye jo bhi kadam uthaae vah chaahe enie act main sanshodhan kaa ho yaa koi anya bill, unki party ne uskaa samarthan kiya
 But again at 370 he reiterated that his party stands on its old stand and hence cannot support it at the moment

 Think how will you feel? And even if the plane is closed, what will be your condition? Yes, it is not a story, but it really happened to Tiffany Adams, a woman going on an Air Canada flight to Toronto
 flite ke dauraan vah so gayi thim or jab kai ghanton baad uthin to puraa plane khaali thi or chaaron ore andhera tha
 Not only this, the plane was parked in the parking lot of Toronto International Airport and was also closed
 mahila ne fasebuk par aapbeetee bataate hue likhaa he, "main lagbhag aadhi raat ko uthi (flite land hone ke kuch ghanton baad ), andar bhayanak thand thi or main ghanghor andhere main abhi bhi apni seat par hi fansi hui thi
 i can't tell how terrible that moment was
 mujhe laga ki main koi bura sapana dekh rahi hum kyonki main yah samaj nahin paa rahi thi ki aisa kaise ho rahaa he
 "not only this, the woman's phone battery was not charged and she could not even call for help
 kismat se mahila ko cockpati main torch mil gaya jisaki madad se vah kisi tarah plane ke mukhya daravaaje tak pahunch pai
 "after opening the door, the woman saw that the weight was 50 feet above the ground and she had realized that she could not jump
 ab uske paas koi doosraa vikalp nahin bachaa tha
 In such a situation, she sat at the door and, with the help of a flashlight, continued to signal her presence
 phir kuch der baad ek airport karmchaaree kii najar us par padi or phir unhen surakshit waapas laayaa gaya
 Air Canada has apologized to the woman for the incident
 haalanki mahila kaa kahana he ki ghatana ke baad se vah sadame main he or thik se so nahin paa rahi he
