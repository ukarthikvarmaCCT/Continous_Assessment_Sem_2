 When he regained consciousness, he found himself lying on the bed
 parijan vilaap kar rahe the or unhen kos rahe the- budhaape main aadmi itnaa laalchee kyon ho jaataa he
 Did you make your own! Another was saying - Brother, old age sticks is such an investment, which never gets returns and sometimes you get it just like it was
 tisare ne kaha- raajnneeti kii duniya kii yahi reet he
 The sticks of old age follow the one who has given him the most oil
 ve khamoshi se lete duniya bhar kii baaten sun rahe the
 For the first time, he was realizing that in the eyes of the family and the world, he has become very old
 itane buudhe ki akele to kya lathi ke bal par bhi chal nahin sakate
 While lying on the bed, he turned on the TV and started watching the news of the miracle of his old age
 lathi ab sanasanaati hui 7 rescorse main daakhil ho chuki thi
 The whole world was cheering for sticks, but there was no mention of the oil-drinker far and wide
 wo bahut chakit, thakit, peedit or aahat the, lekin ab bhi haar maanane ko taiyaar nahin the
 With the intention of setting a new rar, he made a new proposal in front of the family - i do not have to go to the cabinet by holding a stick
 main swasth hum, bina lathi ke loksabhaa adhyaksh kii kursi tak apane aap pahunch saktaa hum
 He was just screaming that the sticks of old age once again rang loudly on him
 hosh aayaa to unhone apane aapako kuch bujurgon ke saath party ke maardarshak mandal main paaya

 a case of murder has come to light after a gang rape of a 16-year-old girl in a factory in Rithala village in Delhi
 haalanki, factory ke maalik kaa kahana he ki ladki ne khudakushi kii he
 The girl used to work with her mother in the same thread-making factory
 ladki ke parivaar waalon kaa kahana he ki 7 march ko wo roj kii tarah apni maa ke saath factory kaam karne gai thi or us din bhi maa-beti ne ek saath lunch kiya
 After lunch, the mother-daughter once again went to work, but after a while the factory owner told the girl's mother that the girl had committed suicide
 uske baad ladki kii laash ko factory ke maalik ne hi bina police ko suchit kiye uske ghar pahunchaa diya
 Family members allege that the factory workers used to molest the girl, due to which she was upset
 parivaar vaale ise hatya kaa maamla bataa rahe hai
 They allege that their daughter was not only gang-raped in the same factory, but she was also murdered
 ladki ke mata-pita ne factory ke maalik narendra gupta or factory ke teen karmchaariyon par gang rape ke baad hatya karne kaa aarope lagaaya he
 Police have currently registered a case of gang rape and murder based on the statement of the girl's family members
 police kaa kahana he ki wo maamle kii jaanch kar rahi he
 So no one has been arrested yet
 police ab ladki ke shav kaa postmortem medical board se karwaane kii taiyaari kar rahi he
 However, this case has certainly raised many questions
 1
 If the girl committed suicide in the factory, what would have been the reason? 2
 ladki ne jab factory main khudakushi kii to uski laash sidhe gharavaalon ko kyon de diya gaya? police ko kyon nahi bulaayaa gaya?3
 The factory also has CCCTV cameras
 kya ghatana ke vakt kii tasviren camere main kaid huin yaa nahin?4
 Why have the police not arrested any of the accused yet? On the other hand, the factory workers are dismissing all the allegations against them outright
 unka kahana he ki ladki ke khudakushi karne ke baad ladki kii maa ne hi maamle kii shikaayat police main karne se manaa kar diya tha or ladki kii maa ke kehane par hi ladki ke shav ko uske ghar pahunchaaya gaya lekin baad main ladki ke parivaar ne gang rape or hatya kaa aarope laga diya
 According to Rajesh, who works in the factory and the accused in the case, there was a quarrel between the girl's parents, due to which she may have committed suicide

 The most relevant question in today's situation is, can earthquakes be predicted? Unfortunately, it can neither be predicted nor prevented
 himalay ab bhi baichaiyn he
 India is moving north and earthquakes will continue to come
 bhugarbha vigyaan main purvanumaan lagaana samasya paidaa karne vaala he
 Most geological events are complex and do not repeat themselves in the same way
 bhautikee or rasayanashastra jaise praayogic vigyaanon se ulat yahaan hamaare saamne jo sthitiyaan hoti hai, unhen ham kisi prayogshaala ke bheetar niyantrit parivesh main nahin jaanch sakate
 Our entire science is based on supervision
 ham samay main peeche kii ore yatra bhi nahin kar sakate
 The only way to study earthquakes of the past is to look in the mirror and learn from them in the mirror
 isiilie bukamp samvedi pattee main un ilaakon kii pahchaan karnaa jaruri he jahaan bukamp aa sakate hai-kashmir se lekar arunachal tak vaaya nepal or bhutan, aracan yoma parvat shrunkhalaaon se lekar andaman-nicobar or indonesian dwipon tak
 Scientists need to see which areas are most susceptible, where the cracks go, and how big earthquakes can occur
 unhen bas kuch sakriy upaay karne hote hai taaki nuksaan ko kam kiya ja sakeh in ilaakon main nirmaan na kiya jaae, agar ho to yah sunishchit kiya jaae ki ye bukamparodhi hon, aisi sadaken na banaai jaaen jo tut saken
 This is the only option
 aaj jahaan himalay hai, vah ek aisa kshetra he jo dakshin kii bhartiya plate or uttar kii urasian plate ke bich kaa ilaaka hota tha
 An ancient ocean named Tethys split these plates five and a half million years ago
 itane hi baras pehle yah mahaasaagar urasian plate ke neeche lupt ho gaya or natijatan bhartiya mahadweep ureshian bhukhand ke saath jaakar mil gaya
 The collision with this collision continues to this day, which is continuously contained within the cracks located between the northern and southern ranges of the Himalayas
 ye sabhi daraaren uttar kii ore yaa to dhans jaati hai yaa dhalaan paidaa karti hai (matlab ki dharti kii sataha ke saath ek kone banaati hai) or samay ke saath daraaron ke upar paidaa hone vaale lambavat hisse dakshin kii ore khiskate rahete hai
 Due to this, the surface of the earth becomes hard here, due to which the Himalayas can achieve such a height
 yah prakriya aaj bhi jari he or isiilie rah-rahakar bukamp aate rahete hai
 An earthquake occurs whenever the southward movement of the Himalayan crevices is interrupted
 bhale hi himalay kii bhavyata inhen daraaron kii dein ho, lekin himalay ke kshetra main aane vaale bukamp se hone vaala vinaash bhi isi prakriya kii dein he
 Unlike the Himalayan region, the southern part of the Himalayas (especially the peninsula, commonly known as the Indian shield) has been stable for a long time and has been in place for billions of years
 in atipracheen pattharon ke bheetar is baat ke sakshya maujuud hai ki barason pehle inamen vikaar aayaa tha or is kshetra main bhugarbha vaigyanikon ne daraaron kii pahchaan bhi kii he
 However, these cracks are no longer active and at the moment there is no danger from them
 kya iskaa matlab yah he ki desh kaa baaki hissaa bukampon ke khatre se mukt mana jaae? durbhaagya se, aisa nahin he
 The way India is moving north towards Tibet, most of its emphasis is on the Himalayan crevices, this shift will have some effect on the stable Indian shields and if this shift is favorable to any ancient rift here Also (if these cracks are almost parallel to the Himalayan crevices) then these old cracks can become active again
 dhaal ke kshetra main aane vaale bukamp virale hote hai, lekin ye vinaashak avashya hote hai
 For example, we can remember the earthquakes of Jabalpur and Latur
 aisa isliye hota he kyonki ye ilaake saghan aabaadi vaale hai or yahaan bukamp kii vibheeshikaa ko kabhi gambhirtha se nahin liya gaya he
 That is why it is gradually being realized that old cracks should also be identified and the possibilities of their awakening should be taken into consideration
 duusare shabdon main, bhugarbhashastra chaahe purana ho yaa nayaa, uski upeksha kar ke aap shat pratishat apni jaan ko jokhim main hi daal rahe hote hai
 The driving force that created the Himalayas will end after one and a half million years from today
 glacier, barish, badalon ke fatne or tej hawaaon se samay ke saath apaksharan kii dar main ijapha hota jayega
 Then playing a game of natural balance will probably flatten the Himalayas like a plateau
 aise main himalay kii shaan or bhavyata jaati rahegi
 Maybe then you go walking on Tibet or China on foot and you don't see mountains on the way
 jaahir he, tab hamamen se koi bhi maujuud nahin hoga or beshak, bukamp bhi uske baad phir kabhi nahin aaenge

 The Supreme Court has dismissed the petition of Ansari Aftab Ahmed, a Muslim officer in the Air Force
 unhen dadhi rakhane ko lekar 2008 main vayusena se discharge kiya gaya tha
 Ansari challenged it in the Supreme Court
 supreme court kaa kahana he ki bhartiya vayusena main dharmik aadhaar par afasar dadhi nahin badha sakate
 Rules are different and religion is different
 donon ek-duusare main dakhal nahin de sakate 
 Air Force officer Ansari Aftab Ahmed said in his petition that he had kept his beard on the basis of religion and the Air Force has discriminated him by removing him
 tippaniyan Aftab had said in his petition that it is his fundamental right to shave under the right to religious freedom given in the constitution
 unhone daleel di thi ki jis tarah vayusena main shaamil sikhon ko dadhi or pagadi rakhane kii ijaajat he usee tarah unhen bhi isaki anumati milani chahie
 Although the then UPA government, avoiding any strict steps, had directed that no action should be taken against the Muslims if they keep beards in the army, but later the government had spoken of the idea

 The comments aftab ne apni yachika main kaha tha ki samvidhan main die gaye dharmik swatantraaa ke adhikaar ke tahat dadhi rakhana unka moulik adhikaar he
 He argued that just as Sikhs in the Air Force are allowed to keep a beard and turban, they should also be allowed to do so

 Renowned actor Rishi Kapoor has advised to sit down and talk between India and Pakistan to resolve the issues
 alvar sinha dwaara nirdeshit 3 agast ko relies hone vaali film 'mulk' main mukhya kalakaar kii bhoomika nibhaa rahe rishi kapur ne film ke bare main baaten kii hai
 During a film-related event in Delhi, while answering the question of unpleasantness videos being spread in the society till date, he advocated a solution through dialogue between the two countries
 ranbir kii shaadi ke intjaar main rishi kapur, aalia sang rishte par kaha
 
 
 Rishi Kapoor said, "I was born when i saw Russia's Communism in China, i saw that the black and white distinction in South Africa was over
" maine yah bhi dekha barlin main east or west kii diwaar gira di gai germany ko uniform kar diya
 Apart from this i saw that North Korea and America are sitting together and discussing
 lekin india or pakistan ke bich hamaara yah 1971 se jo jhagada he vah abhi tak hal nahin hua he
 "in his own style, Rishi Kapoor gave advice on the furious atmosphere that is brewing between the two countries," Hey sit down man or chair and sit on the table and get some result from it
 kya ham ladate hi rahenge? duniya apni apni samasya hal kar rahi he, ham kyon nahin hal kar sakate?"40 hajaar feet kii oonchai se bole rishi kapur- 'cheers ranbir, tum par garv he'film ke kaarykram ke dauraan rishi kapur se poocha gaya tha ki samaaj main bad rahe sampradayik vaimnasy ko lekar vah kise jimmedaar maanate hai
 Responding directly to the question, Rishi Kapoor said that we should increase brotherhood among ourselves
 rishi kapur ke is bayaan par shatrughna sinha ne kaha- rishi kapur ne thik kaha he ki america or uttar korea agar baatcheet se apni problem solve kar sakate hai
 Germany's two countries can resolve their problems by negotiating
 aise bhi duniya main example hai ki satta paksh or vipaksh ne milakar sarkaar chalaai hai
 So India and Pakistan can resolve whatever differences are there through negotiation

 Mission scientist Bill Makenan said that with the discovery of Pluto in the year 1930, its size was being debated

 Actor Sushant Singh Rajput dismissed allegations that he had refused to dance during a reality show where he had gone on to promote his upcoming film
 sushantne kaha ki aisi chijen film ke production house dwaara tay kii jaati hai
 Sushant's next film 'MS Dhoni: The Untold Story' is based on the life of Indian cricketer Mahendra Singh Dhoni
 sushant ne apni film ke pramoshnake liye haal hi main dance sho 'jhalak dikhalaa ja' ke set par gaye the
 There were reports that Sushant showed tantrums there and asked the show's team not to mention that his career started as a TV actor
 What an actor does on a reality show is decided by the studio for the film
 i have worked in theater, tv and films and i don't differentiate

 Ammonium nitrate was used in a pressure cooker bomb blast in a car a few meters from the scene just hours after firing on a tourist vehicle in the Jama Masjid area of old Delhi
 dilli police ne is aashay kaa daawa karte hue kaha ki is visphot main ardex yaa datonator kaa istemaal nahin kiya he
 The incident of the car explosion took place near the police station, just 50 meters from Jama Masjid Gate number three at around 2 am
 isse kuch hi ghante pehle jama masjid ke paas hi motorcycle savaar logon ke golibari karne ke kaaran taiwan ke do paryatak ghayal ho gaye the
 Investigators have questioned about 30 people since yesterday's incident
 police ke ek varisht adhikari ne kaha ki is maamle kii jaanch kaa kaam aaj subah dilli police kii vishesh shakha ko saunp diya gaya
 a case under the Explosives Act has been registered in this case
 golibari kii ghatana ke bare main puche jane par unhone kaha ki is maamle main bhartiya dand samhita kii dhara 307 or shastr kanoon ke tahat maamla darj kiya gaya he or jaanch jari he
 a senior Delhi Police official said, 'we have got some clues
 ham is par kaam kar rahe hai, hamen vishwaas he ki ham maamle ko sulajhaa lenge
 However, earlier police had said that the resident of Vasantkunj, who was arrested for questioning, has been acquitted of suspicion
 ek police adhikari ne bataaya, ‘ek sthaneey vyakti ne hamen ek motorcycle kaa panjiyan number dete hue daawa kiya tha ki donon bandookdhaari golibari karke faraar ho gaye
 After verification we come to know that he had no role in the incident
 ’haalanki dilli police is baat se inkaar kar rahi he ki is ghatana main kisi sangathit aatankwaadi gut kii bhoomika he, lekin khufia visheshgy is baat par jor de rahe hai ki yah pratibandhit sanghathan indian mujahidin kaa kaam ho saktaa he, jo dilli samet kai bade shaharon main shrinkhalabaddh visphoton ke peeche rah chukaa he
 The Indian Mujahideen, taking responsibility for the incident, warned of terrorist attacks during the Commonwealth Games
 gut ne kaha tha ki is ghatana ko batla house muthbhed ko do saal puure hone ke din anjaam diya gaya he
 Police suspect that there may be a group of youths or local criminals who have lost their way behind this incident
 adhikariyon ke mutabik iske peeche rashtramandal khelon ke maddenjar logon ko daraane kaa uddeshy ho saktaa he or is ghatana main indian mujahidin jaise guton ke shaamil hone kaa koi sanket nahin dikh rahaa
 Security has been increased in the city after the incident
 iske alaava shahar bhar main nigaraanee ke liye sashastr pulicekarmiyon or ardhsainik balon ke javaanon ko tainaat kiya gaya he
 When asked about the possibility of the Indian Mujahideen being involved in the bomb blast, Delhi Police spokesperson Rajan Bhagat said yesterday that the pressure cooker was bomb-shaped and crudely prepared
 unhone kaha tha, ‘aisa lagata he ki isamen sthaneey giroh yaa raah se bhatke yuvakon kaa haath he

 namaskara main raveesh kumaar
 
 
 Bihar needs special state status
 jediu, argedy, congress or bijepi mul rup ye chaar prakaar ke dal vishesh rajya kaa darja dene par sahamat hai, magar nahin mila
 Everyone kept asking for each other and the election came
 sab kehete hai ki maang kaa unka tarika syrius he, baaki kaa nautanki
 Our intention is white with their intention
 nitish kumaar ne ravivaar ko jab skool, college or daftar band rahete hai, bihar band kaa aahvaan kar is mudde ko janata ke bich rakhane kaa prayaas kiya, to lalu ne chutki le lee
 This remains closed on Sunday
 vaise ravivaar ke din band karne kaa idia bura nahin he, logon ko dikkat kam hogi
 Earlier on Saturday evening, Nitish Kumar tried to awaken the center by playing Tharia utensils, but when the center did not wake up, the next day he sat on a dharna at Patna's Gandhi Maidan for five hours
 arvind kejariwal ne jab dharna kiya tha, tab kitna sanvaidhanik, naitik prashn khadaa ho gaya tha
 After the bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh, when the Seemandhra region was given special status for five years, Nitish has again raised his issue
 kaha ki congress, bijepi ne simandhra ke liye to deal kar lee or isi deal ke tahat bihar ko chhod diya
 There was not even a demand for Seemandhra, whereas there has been a demand for Bihar
 vipakshi dal bijepi ne kyon nahin dabaav daalaa
 The Congress did not take any action on the Raghuramarajan report
 sitambar 2013 main report ai thi, jisamen bihar or anya pichde rajyon ke liye vishesh darja dene kaa rasta sujhaayaa he
 There was no word like special state status in it, but Bihar has been included in the ten least developed states of the country
 saal 2009 main bihar vidhansabha ne or 2010 main vidhaan parishad ne savarsammati se vishesh rajya kaa darja dene kaa prastaav paas kiya tha
 Even after five years, this issue continues to arise every time like the first year
 17 march 2013 ko dilli ke ramlila maidan main nitish kumaar ne ise lekar raily bhi kii
 Also split from BJP in June 2013
 modi virodh ke alaava ise ek bada kaaran bataaya
 Still did not get the status
 nitish is mudde par virodhiyon ko gherna chaahate hai, magar aaj bijepi netaa arun jetali ne bhi unhen gherne kaa prayaas kiya
 Jaitley alleges that for the last two years, the Congress has been showing greed of special status to the JDU
 2013 ke apane bajet bhaashan main vitt mantri ne sanket bhi diya tha ki ek cameti banaakar bihar ke daawey par vichaar kiya jayega
 Jaitley has written that this assurance was purely political, so that the JDU is separated from the BJP
 mujhe nahin maaloom ki jediu kaa chatur netritv bhi is jhaanse main kaise aa gaya
 Jaitley writes a blog and Modi remains silent on this at a Muzaffarpur rally
 jabaki bijepi 28 farvari ko nitish se pehle bihar main is maang ko lekar rail roko andolan bhi karti he
 Some articles have been received on this issue from Google
 radiff dot com par dilli ke indian statical institute kii visiting professor indira rajaraman ne likhaa he ki bihar kii daavedaari nahin banati he
 Bihar should seek its pride in the fact that it does not want special status
 may 2013 ke iconomik and polytical vikali main govind bhattacharya ne likhaa he ki vishesh rajya kaa darja die jane ke jo bhi maanak hai, bihar un par khara nahin utarataa
 The backwardness of Bihar is not due to geographical deficiencies, but due to poor governance of the past
 kharaab gavarnence ke aadhaar par darja nahin mil saktaa
 Many such states will come in it
 govind kaa kahana he abhi bihar ko centre se jo bhi paisa miltaa he, uskaa sabase bada hissaa sidhe jilon ko jaataa he jin par rajya kaa koi niyantran nahin hota
 Anyway, in the Gadgil Mukherjee formula that was formulated to give special state status, now 11 states have come in place of three, while there has been no increase in the plan amount
 isliye vishesh rajya kaa darja mil bhi jaae, to koi bahut paisa nahin milane vaala he
 If Nitish demands control over the money given to the districts instead of special status, then there may be more benefits
 ek lekh en ke singh kaa bhi he
 Those whom Nitish did not re-make a member of Rajya Sabha
 pataa nahin is vakt enke singh kaa kya mat he, lekin march 2013 ke iconomik times main unhone isaki vakaalat karte hue likhaa tha ki becoward rigen grant fund kaa praavdhaan to he hi centre ke paas
 Even when Bihar was reorganized in 2000, there was talk of giving special incentives to Bihar, which was not received
 barahavin yojana main 12 hajaar karod dene kaa prastaav hua tha, magar cabinet ne manjuuri nahin di
 The matter of the sharing of central plan items is also technical and complex
 isi farvari main rajya sarkaar ke aarthik survey ke anusaar 2012−13 main growth rate 13
 5 percent
 pichley saat saal main 12 pratishat kaa salanaa ausat he
 According to the 2013 National Sample Survey Organization data, poverty in Bihar decreased from 54 percent to 33
 7 pratishat rah gai he
 Then why does Bihar need it? Will Nitish be able to stop the people of Bihar from moving towards the lalu-congress or bjp-paswan camp on this issue? Indeed, Bihar deserves it or it has become a weapon against all other parties

 The revelation of the station master in Aaj Tak's sting was disturbing
 unke khole gaye raaj kii tah main jane ke liye ajtak ne junior ejeeniyar mentanence se sawaal jawaab kiye
 JE also made sensational revelations from the station master
 usne bataaya ki patari to subah se hi tuuti padi thi
 He told in writing from the station master to Delhi Control that the train can overturn at any time
 haalanki uske anusaar is chetavanee ko sabane nazarandaaj kar diya
 Khatauli in Muzaffarnagar district of UP lost 20 lives with a loud voice this month, while railway officials tried to show the severity of the situation by calling it a result of possible negligence
 india today ne 18 agast ko hue train haadase kii parat-dar-parat jaanch kii to saamne aayaa ki ye sab kuch ho saktaa he lekin mahaj laaparvaahee nahin
 Please tell that this accident happened due to derailment of 13 coaches of Kalinga Utkal Express going to Haridwar
 haadase ke ek din baad railway board ke sadsy mohammad jamshed ne kaha tha, ‘gavarment railway police (jiarapy) ne 151, 154 or 427 ke tarah exiaar darj kii he
 These clauses relate to damage to railway property due to mischievous act, death due to negligence, causing great injury to the life or personal safety of people, etc
 ’ har train haadase ke baad jaise ki niyamit prakriya apanaai jaati he, railway adhikariyon ne khatauli ke paas train patari se utarane ke haadase kii bhi aupchaarik jaanch ke aadesh die hai
 However, for the Khatauli train accident, the country will not have to wait for months or years for the government to complete the investigation and then make its report public
 india today ne is yathasthiti ko tod kar khatauli train haadase kii jaanch mahaz 15 din main puri kar ‘doodh kaa doodh or pani kaa pani’ kar diya he
 The results of the investigation are surprising

 Investigation has revealed that the passengers of other trains passing on the Khatauli route that day had good luck that no accident happened to them, otherwise the track on which these trains were running was badly damaged
 india today ke under cover reporters ne aise kai adhikariyon kii jaanch kii jo haadase ke baad sthiti par najar rakhe hue the
 At the time of the accident on 19 August, the station master Prakash Singh was on duty in Khatauli
 prakaash singh ne khulaasa kiya ki ki ejiniers railroad kii marammat main lage the vahiin trek trainon kii awajahi saamaanya dinon kii tarah puure veg se jari thi
 This was a blatant violation of basic security rules
 prakaash singh ke mutabik rail joints ke kshatigrast hone kii aupchaarik shikaayatein bhejne ke bhejne ke baavjood railway ke central control ne andekhi kii
 The station master told India Today's Under Cover Reporters, 'the engineers had been working since early morning on August 19 but none of us had been informed for this
 unhone marammat ke kaam kaa koi hawala nahin diya jabaki trek par trainon kii awajahi jari thi
 Engineers continued to open and tie the tracks
 ’reporter ne jaananaa chaha, ‘aapkaa kehane kaa matlab trek kaa kuch hissaa hataa hua tha?’prakaash singh ne kaha, ‘haa, unhone (ejiniyaron) ne use hataa rakhaa tha
 They were working without permission
 wo marammat ke liye trainon kaa sanchaalan band karne ke liye kah rahe the, control section ne anumati nahin di thi
 According to Prakash Singh, none of the officials took cognizance of the emergency messages sent about the broken rail joints
 prakaash singh ne bataaya ki ejiniyaron ne central control se 20 minute ke liye trainon kaa sanchaalan rokane ke liye aagrah kiya tha jisase ki wo trek ke kshatigrast hisse ko badal sake
 The station master reported that the control refused
 vahaan se jawaab tha ki janshatabdi, utkal or anya trainen apane root par thim
 According to the control command, it was not possible at that time to give instructions to issue the operating block of trains
 ye sunne main jitna kharaab or daraavna lage lekin stesan master prakaash singh ke mutabik ejiniyaron ne khatauli main kalinga utkal ke root se chaar feet trek ko hataa diya tha
 In such a situation the derailment of the train was certain
 khatauli main junior railway ejeeniyar mohan laal meena ne bhi stesan master prakaash singh ne jo kaha uskaa samarthan kiya
 Meena claimed that a written complaint was sent for the track repair on her behalf, which nobody heard
 meena ne kaha, ‘hamane marammat ke liye controling cmand se trephic block kii maang kii thi
 but that did not happen
 likhit main ye bataane ke baavjood bhi trek kaa ek jod tut gaya he or uski vajah se haadasa ho saktaa he, hamen anumati nahin di gai
 The reporter asked, "what was said on their behalf?" Meena said, 'he flatly refused
 unhone kaha koi block jari nahin kiya ja saktaa
 i told them that if a train derailed, we would not be responsible
 ’ Virender Sehwag may be considered an aggressive and fearless batsman but he said that he also feels 'nervous' when facing the first ball but he never lets it appear in front of the bowler
 sahvaag ne kaha, ‘har baar jab main krij par utarataa hum or pehali gend kaa saamana karata hum to main nervas hota hum
 i never show it though because if the bowler senses it, he will try to pressure me
 ’unhone kaha, ‘mujhe gendbaaj ko sandesh dena hota he ki main aakraamakata or vishwaas ke saath uskaa saamana karne ke liye yahaan maujuud hum, phir chaahe main rakshaatmak shaat khelun yaa aakraamak
 Sehwag believes that his mental strength and confidence has helped him dominate the bowlers in international cricket
 daayen haath ke is ballebaaj ne bisisiai kii aadhikarik website se aaj kaha, ‘mujhe lagata he ki yah maansik majbootee he
 i have the confidence and confidence that i can do well against any team and can score runs against any bowling attack
 ’sahvaag ne kaha ki unhone ballebaaji ke apane tareeke main kuch badlaav kiya he or ab vah apane shaat khilne se pehle kuch samay wicket par tikne kii koshish karte hai
 He said, 'now, i have become a bit more cautious about how the wicket is behaving, whether the ball is swinging or not and what the bowling attack is like
 main halaat or sthiti ko acchhee tarah samajhane ke liye khud ko thodaa adhik samay detaa hum or iske baad apni pari kii ranneeti banaata hum
 "sehwag said," Even if a bowler throws a half-wicket on a Ghasiali pitch, i still attack him and play square cut if the ball is short outside the off side
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘lekin agar koi gendbaaj acchhee line or length ke saath gendbaaji karata he to mujhe nayi gend ko sammaan dena padataa he
 If i do this and play 10 to 12 overs with caution, then over time the ball gets old and the bowlers also get a little tired
 iske baad main unhen nishaanaa bana saktaa hum
 When asked what is the difference between Sachin Tendulkar and Gautam Gambhir starting the innings, Sehwag said that when Tendulkar is his partner, he is under less pressure
 sahvaag ne kaha, ‘jab main tendulkar ke saath ballebaaji karata hum to mere upar kaaphi kam dabaav hota he kyonki virdohi unhen out karne par dhyaan lagaate hai
 While bowling with Gautam, the bowlers are more concerned about getting me out
 isliye mujhe satark hona padataa he
 Apart from this, Gautam and i are very good friends and we have very good communication

 sahvaag ne kaha, har baar jab main krij par utarataa hum or pehali gend kaa saamana karata hum, to main nervas hota hum
 i never show it though, because if the bowler senses it, he will try to pressure me
 unhone kaha, mujhe gendbaaj ko sandesh dena hota he ki main aakraamakata or vishwaas ke saath uskaa saamana karne ke liye yahaan maujuud hum, phir chaahe main rakshaatmak shot khelun yaa aakraamak
 Sehwag believes that his mental strength and confidence have helped him dominate the bowlers in international cricket
 daaen haath ke is ballebaaj ne kaha, mujhe lagata he ki yah maansik majbootee he
 i am confident and confident that i can do well against any team and can score runs against any bowling attack
 sahvaag ne kaha ki unhone ballebaaji ke apane tareeke main kuch badlaav kiya he or ab vah apane shot khilne se pehle kuch samay wicket par tikne kii koshish karte hai
 Sehwag said, "now i have become a bit more cautious about how the wicket is behaving, whether the ball is swinging or not and what the bowling attack is like
" main halaat or sthiti ko acchhee tarah samajhane ke liye khud ko thodaa adhik samay detaa hum or iske baad apni pari kii ranneeti banaata hum
 Sehwag said, "even if a bowler throws a half-wicket on a crooked pitch, i still attack him and if the ball is short outside the off side, i play a square cut
 unhone kaha, lekin agar koi gendbaaj acchhee line or length ke saath gendbaaji karata he, to mujhe nai gend ko sammaan dena padataa he
 If i do this and play 10 to 12 overs with caution, over time the ball gets old and the bowlers also get a little tired
 iske baad main unhen nishaanaa bana saktaa hum
 The comments yah puche jane par ki sachin tendulkar or gautam gambhir ke saath pari kii shuruyaat karne main kya antar he, sahvaag ne kaha ki jab tendulkar unke saajhedaar hote hai, to vah kam dabaav main hote hai
 Sehwag said, when i bat with Tendulkar, there is a lot of pressure on me, because the opponents focus on getting them out
 gautam gambhir ke saath ballebaaji karte hue gendbaaj mujhe out karne ko lekar adhik chintit rahete hai, isliye mujhe satark hona padataa he
 By the way, Gautam and i are very good friends and we have very good communication

 The comments yah puche jane par ki sachin tendulkar or gautam gambhir ke saath pari kii shuruyaat karne main kya antar he, sahvaag ne kaha ki jab tendulkar unke saajhedaar hote hai, to vah kam dabaav main hote hai
 Sehwag said, when i bat with Tendulkar, there is a lot of pressure on me, because the opponents focus on getting them out
 gautam gambhir ke saath ballebaaji karte hue gendbaaj mujhe out karne ko lekar adhik chintit rahete hai, isliye mujhe satark hona padataa he
 By the way, Gautam and i are very good friends and we have very good communication
 unhone kaha, mujhe gendbaaj ko sandesh dena hota he ki main aakraamakata or vishwaas ke saath uskaa saamana karne ke liye yahaan maujuud hum, phir chaahe main rakshaatmak shot khelun yaa aakraamak
 Sehwag believes that his mental strength and confidence have helped him dominate the bowlers in international cricket
 daaen haath ke is ballebaaj ne kaha, mujhe lagata he ki yah maansik majbootee he
 i am confident and confident that i can do well against any team and can score runs against any bowling attack
 sahvaag ne kaha ki unhone ballebaaji ke apane tareeke main kuch badlaav kiya he or ab vah apane shot khilne se pehle kuch samay wicket par tikne kii koshish karte hai
 Sehwag said, "now i have become a bit more cautious about how the wicket is behaving, whether the ball is swinging or not and what the bowling attack is like
" main halaat or sthiti ko acchhee tarah samajhane ke liye khud ko thodaa adhik samay detaa hum or iske baad apni pari kii ranneeti banaata hum
 Sehwag said, "even if a bowler throws a half-wicket on a crooked pitch, i still attack him and if the ball is short outside the off side, i play a square cut
 unhone kaha, lekin agar koi gendbaaj acchhee line or length ke saath gendbaaji karata he, to mujhe nai gend ko sammaan dena padataa he
 If i do this and play 10 to 12 overs with caution, over time the ball gets old and the bowlers also get a little tired
 iske baad main unhen nishaanaa bana saktaa hum

 sahvaag ne kaha, ab main, ise lekar kuch adhik satark ho gaya hum ki wicket kis tarah kaa bartaav kar rahaa he, gend swing kar rahi he yaa nahin or gendbaaji akraman kaisaa he
 i give myself a little more time to understand the situation and the situation better and then make my innings strategy
 sahvaag ne kaha, haalanki agar koi gendbaaj ghasiyaali pich par half vaali phenkata he, to bhi main us par akraman karata hum or agar of said ke baahar gend short hoti he, to squaire cat kheltaa hum
 "but if a bowler bowls with a good line and length, i have to pay respect to the new ball
" agar main aisa karata hum or satarkta ke saath 10 se 12 over khel letaa hum, to samay ke saath gend puraani ho jaati he or gendbaaj bhi thode thak jate hai
 After this i can target them
 tippaniyan Asked what is the difference in opening innings with Sachin Tendulkar and Gautam Gambhir, Sehwag said that when Tendulkar is his partner, he is under less pressure
 sahvaag ne kaha, jab main tendulkar ke saath ballebaaji karata hum, to mere upar kaaphi kam dabaav hota he, kyonki virdohi unhen out karne par dhyaan lagaate hai
 While bowling with Gautam Gambhir, bowlers are more concerned about getting me out, so i have to be cautious
 vaise gautam or main kaaphi achche mitra hai or hamaare bich main kaaphi acha samvaad he

 The business class of the state is angry with the Modi government due to demonetisation and GST
 lekin party kaaryakartaaon ko vishwaas he ki centre sarkaar gujarat main voting se pehle jiesti ke tex system main thodaa badlaav karegi or use aasaan banaaegi
 So that during voting, the anger of the voters does not come on the government
 visheshgyon kaa bhi maananaa he ki jiesti lagu hone se rajya main chote kaarobaariyon ko kaaphi pareshaani hui he
 Speaking to Mail Today, a senior BJP leader said that yes, we know that people are facing a lot of difficulties
 unhone kaha ki party yah samaj rahi he vidhansabha chunaav main jiesti ek bada mudda ban gaya he
 But, the BJP leader also said that nobody knows Gujarati businessmen better than Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP President Amit Shah
 unhone kaha ki jiesti main kuch argent sudhaar kiye gaye hai, isse congress ise chunavi mudda nahin bana paaegi
 The leader said that people remember Inspector Raj during the Congress government
 centre sarkaar ne jiesti main jo badlaav kiye hai, wo voton ke liye nahin balki logon kii pareshaani dur karne ke liye kiye hai
 When asked if the party will pressurize the Modi government to make more changes in GST
 to unhone kaha ki vah is mudde par media main baat nahin kar sakate hai
 Significantly, votes are to be cast in Gujarat on 9 and 14 December
 isse pehle congress ne jiesti ko ek bada mudda banaaya he
 Many traders in Surat took to the streets to protest the implementation of GST, the Congress wants to take advantage of this

 Three years after the start of college, the dreams of the students are crumbling due to lack of basic facilities
 kareeb 700 vidhyaarthiyon kaa daakhila hua he jinamein 70 ladkiyaan bhi hai
 Oddly enough, there is not a single permanent teacher in computer science, electrical and electronics
 yahi nahin, placement ke liye bhi sthai shikshak nahin hai
 The college has sanctioned posts of 64 teachers, including the principal, but there are only 7 permanent teachers
 karmchaariyon ke liye sweekrut 75 padon kii tulana main mahaj 17 padasthapit hai
 Although guest lecturers are hired to meet the shortage of teachers, they do not last long due to lack of proper honorarium

 And Rs 15,000 per month

 unhone apane kariyar kii shuruyaat 1920 main shimla ke chote se cesil hotel main desk clerk ke taur par kii thi, jiske liye unhen 50 rupye prati maah milte the
 But due to the ardor of learning and business intelligence, he got a new job in Carlton Hotel in a few years

 Then in August 1934 he became the sole proprietor of the Clarks Hotel in Delhi and Shimla
 us samay unhone apni beti se kaha tha, ''jab tum badi ho jaaogi to tum jahaan bhi jaaogi, tumhen ek obaroy hotel milegaa
 "then in 1948 he founded East India Hotels, now EIH Ltd

 He made the first acquisition of the Oberoi Grand Hotel in Calcutta

 The agitation for the government in Maharashtra: Tej BJP and Shiv Sena have now come face to face on Twitter
 Meenakshi Lekhi, Tejinder Bagga has set a different path between the two parties for the post of Chief Minister's post in Maharashtra between the Bharatiya Janata Party and Shiv Sena
 
 bhaajapa ne sarkaar banane se inkaar kiya to shivasena satta main aane ke liye ensipi-congress ke paale main jane ko taiyaar ho gai
 Simultaneously, Bharatiya Janata Party leaders have also started targeting the Shiv Sena on social media

 BJP MP Meenakshi Lekhi wrote on Twitter: This is how the Shiv Sena developed

 tejinder paal singh bagga aksar apane twit or trend karwaane ke liye jane jate hai, yahaan bhi unhone aisa kiya or kuch aisa twit ho gaya ki soshal media par # tumsenahopayega trend hone laga
 Apart from this, he also tweeted a video of Balasaheb Thackeray, which caused quite a ruckus
 video main balasaheb congress ke khilaaf kuch bol rahe hai
 Not only this, Bagga shared a cartoon in which Uddhav Thackeray, Aditya Thackeray are standing in front of Congress President Sonia Gandhi and he is saying that you are our 'matoshree'
 gauratlab he ki mukhyamantri pad par machi raar ke baad shivasena ne bhaajapa kaa samarthan nahin kiya to bijepi ne sarkaar banane se inkaar kar diya
 When the Shiv Sena made up its mind to go with the ncp-congress, Minister Arvind Sawant resigned from the Shiv Sena quota in the central government

 Minister of State for Railways Manoj Sinha has advocated for giving more strength to the Railway Protection Force (RPF), which is taking charge of the safety of Indian Railways
 unhone ol india conference on railway security ke maukey par sambodhit karte hue kaha ki arpeef ek dantaheen suraksha bal he
 The RPF needs to be further strengthened in view of the needs of railways across the country
 unhone kaha ki siarpief ko vaastavik takat dene ke liye arpeef act main sanshodhan kii jarurat he
 However, speaking on the occasion, Railway Minister Piyush Goyal said that irrespective of whether the law changes or not, whether it is GRP or CRPF, in all these technical things we should not work together to work for the safety of railway passengers
 is maukey par grih mantri rajnath singh ne kaha ki yatriyon kii dikkaton ko dekhte hue railgadee main online exiaar kii suvidha kaise di ja sakati he is par vichaar karenge
 Power to register crime is not a matter of fact that RPF takes up the responsibility of protecting railway properties and railway properties across the country, but it does not have the power to register crime
 iske liye har rajya main exiaar darj karne kaa jimmaa jiarapy ko diya gaya he
 In such a case, if there is any crime in a train, then the railway passenger has to write a report in the GRP police station at the concerned railway station
 isamen dikkat yah hoti he ki rail yatri ko yah pataa hi nahin hota he ki uske saath aparaadh kahaan hua he
 Not knowing the place is the biggest problem for the crime in the moving train
 iske alaava duusari pareshaani yah bhi he ki rail yatri apni yatra puri karen yaa exiaar likhavane jaae
 In the face of these problems, if an FIR is also given, then no railway passenger would like to come back from distant places to solve the crime
 aise main chalati railgadee main yaa railway stesan par rail yatriyon ke saath hue kisi aparaadh main apradhi ko sajaa dilvaanaa aasaan nahin hota he
 In view of such problems of crimes committed in the railways, for the past many years, there has been a continuous demand that the RPF Act should be given the right to register an FIR but due to lack of consensus between the Center and the state
 This case has been hanging for a long time
 is maamle kii gambhirtha ko dekhte hue grih mantri rajnath singh ne online exiaar kaa system shuru karne kaa suzav diya he
 He has asked the Railways to consider it and decide
 grih mantralay is maamle main puraa sahyog degaa
 Terming his suspension from the BJP as out of the party's jurisdiction, Ram Jethmalani on Tuesday targeted Nitin Gadkari once again and accused him of leading the main opposition party on a suicide route
 gadakari ko sakht lahaze main likhe patr main jethmalani ne sibiai ke nideshak kii niyukti kaa virodh kiye jane ke liye arun jetali ko bhi aade haathon liya
 The suspended MP from BJP said, 'your order of suspension (to Jethmalani) is going to be out of the jurisdiction and take the authority of the Parliamentary Board in your hands
 or koi aisi sthiti nahin ai thi ki aap mujhase baat kiye bina aage bade or saamaanya shishtachar kaa paalan na karen
 He said that the action taken by Gadkari against him has no effect on him because he is due to the love and respect of the people in the legal profession and politics which is not a sign of membership of Parliament
 jethmalani ne apane patr main kaha, ‘mujhe is baat kaa puraa bharosa he ki aap aatmghaatee maarg par bad rahe hai or aap puri party ko isamen ghaseetne par amaadaa hai
 The old saying is 'destruction black, opposite wisdom'
 ’unhone aarope lagaaya ki gadakari unke prati pehle se durbhaavna se prerit hai or isliye unhen nilambit karne kaa kadam uthaaya he
 Jethmalani in his letter also raised the subject of controversy over the appointment of Ranjit Sinha as the director of the CBI and mentioned the alleged role of Leader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Arun Jaitley in the case
 jethmalani ne kaha ki ranjit sinha ke pratidwandvi kii ore se daayar maamla itnaa kukhyat he or uske bare main hamaare party netaaon ko jaankaree hi nahin he
 He claimed that the lawyer advocating the rival officer had been a junior to Jaitley
 jethmalani ne kaha, ‘yah asambhav he ki cat ke samaksh daayar is vaad ke bare main unhen (jetali) jaankaree nahin ho or main mahasoos karata hum ki aap (gadakari) jetali kii salaah par kaam kar rahe hai
 He said that he got information from the media that his party leaders were opposing the appointment to the post of CBI director
 unhone gadakari se shikaayat kii ki haalanki ve rajyasabha ke varisht sadsy or bhaajapa ke sansthaapakon main hai, lekin unase lokapal ke mudde par loksabhaa main vipaksh kii netaa sushamaa swaraj or rajyasabha main vipaksh ke netaa arun jetali ne charchaa nahin kii

 us par ye cese april main die gaye ek bhaashan kii bina par lagaae gaye hai

 Irom will get married and contest elections
 kahin aisa to nahin ki ham sab irom sharmila kii kahani kaa thik se paath karne main chook gaye
 Every day, some leaders keep praising the greatness of India's democracy, have they also missed it? solah saal tak kisi ek shaks ne upwas ke zariye apni baat rakhi ho, kya uskaa dhiraj mahaan loktantr kii rajya vyavasthaaon ke liye misaal nahin he
 How would you like to see Irom Sharmila's struggle journey as a citizen
 yah is baat par nirbhar karegaa ki aap loktantr main dharna pradarshan yaa andolan ko kaise dekhte hai or kya aap khud kabhi kisi dharna pradarshan main gaye hai
 Many of us live without going in any movement
 vaise log bhi irom sharmila ke andolan ke mahatv ko samaj sakate hai
 Our leaders tell the story of their going to jail or eating sticks for twenty times, but they cut off the story of the struggle of a citizen like Irom
 aakhir kyon irom kaa yah faisla badi ghatana kii tarah dastak nahin de sakaa
 As long as she was an example of the extreme and endurance of every movement on hunger strike
 kya isliye hua ki ham or aap ab aise loktantric sangharshon ko ahmiyat dene se bachate hai
 The voice of the student movements of Film and Television Institute of India, University of Hyderabad and Jawaharlal Nehru University reached the Parliament, there was a lot of squabbles but these movements slowly started cooling down
 sarkaar kii takat ke itane rup hote hai ki uske saamne chote samoohon kaa tik paanaa mushkil hota he
 All governments and political parties had become dull about student politics
 lekin haal ke chaatr sangharshon ne raajnneetik dalon ko satark kar diya
 Perhaps this may have been the reason that through media and retired bureaucrats, it was often said that students come to college
 raajnneeti karne nahin aate hai
 The minister even started speaking that students should stay away from politics
 ve apni javaani ke kisse to bechate rahete hai magar chaahate hai ki dusron ko ye kissa sunaane kaa mauka na mili ki wo college ke dinon main andolan main gaya tha
 The country whose history of independence is full of the voices of many young people studying in colleges, how those youths read books, wrote, ate sticks, went to jail and were hanged
 isi desh main ek ritair naukarshah tii es aar subrahmanyam cameti kii report main kaha jaataa he ki campus main pradarshan, andolan, gheraav or anya baadha daalane vaali gatividhiyaan badhati ja rahi hai
 Due to this the examination is delayed and the examination is postponed
 raajnneetik rup se sakriy chaatro kaa chota sa samooh aise vyavdhaan paidaa karata he
 The headline of Ritika Chopra's report is to limit political activities on campus
 ek din koi or ritair naukarshah aayega jo report degaa ki samaaj main log khaane kamaane or marane aae hai, andolan karne nahin, isse sarkaar ko nuksaan hota he
 Will declare Patel and Dalit movements illegal in Gujarat
 bina in sawaalon par gaye aap irom sharmila kii kahani kii seemaa or sambhaavna ko nahin samaj sakate hai
 Therefore, you cannot easily understand how political parties want to protect their right to perform only to themselves
 ve nagarikon ke dharna pradarshan ko avaidh ghoshit karne or unhen jagah na dene kaa har upaay karte hai
 The media now presents these protests as a disruption
 trephic jam kaa kaaran bataata he
 For a moment, think that if the legitimacy of the demonstrations of students and peasants workers will not remain, then what will happen when all political parties join hands on an issue
 awaz uthaane kii khanaapurti kar chup ho jaaen
 The sites of picketing demonstrations are being eliminated from every city
 campus main raajnneetik na karne dene kii baat chal rahi he
 So where will politics be
 beauty parlor yaa gymkhana club main
 This is the reason leaders have changed the location of the demonstration
 dilli main ab ve ek duusare ke gharon ko gherte hai
 Jantar Mantar goes less
 vahaan pehle se baithe dharne vaale kahin unhen na gher len ki hamaari awaz kab uthaaoge
 The practice of collectively ignoring the protests of the citizens, the movements as anti-development, is increasing
 aise main koi vyaktigat sangharsh ko 16 saal tak jari rakhen, beshak use kai logon kaa samarthan mila ho lekin yah kisi ajoobe se kam nahin lagata
 If democracy beats within us then why the story of Irom Sharmila does not beats
 netaaon ke mukh se baat baat main bharat kaa loktantr mahaan se mahanatam hota ja rahaa he, usee mahaan loktantr main irom sharmila kaa yah sangharsh kis mukaam par rakhaa jayega
 i want to tell you something about Irom
 42 saal kii ho gai hongi irom sharmila, imphal kii is ladki ke nau bhai bahan hai
 This girl from ordinary laborer family passes tenth in three times but after failing in twelfth, she decides to stand on her feet
 typing or silaai seekhney ke baad patrakarita kii padhai padhati he
 His column appears in Imphal newspapers
 apni diariyon main kavita likhte likhte irom sharmila manipur main bikhare samaaj or satta ke krur chehron ko dekhne lagati he
 Bicycles measure the city and the village
 ek maanavadhikaar sanghathan ke liye intern banati he or AFSPA kanoon ke prabhaavon ko chaanbin karne nikalati he
 Irom used to fast on every Thursday
 aise hi ek brihaspativaar ko jab cycle se ghar lautati hai to pataa chalata he ki molom main 10 log assam rifles ke saath hui muthbhed main maare gaye hai
 These included a woman of 60 years and a boy of 17 years
 2 november 2000 kii yah ghatana he
 That night Irom wrote on a paper where the beginning and end of peace would end
 irom ne faisla kar liya ki ve bhukh hadtaal karengi
 No one came to know that Irom will be on a long fast for the next 16 years
 maine ye jaankaree dipti priya mehrotra kii kitaab se lee he jiskaa naam he irom sharmila or manipur janata kii saahas yatra
 This book is also in Hindi
 armd forces special power act ke khilaaf manipur main bhi pradarshan ho rahaa he or kashmir main bhi iske kilaaf awaazen uthati hai
 The path of Irom is completely different from the sounds of Kashmir
 bhale hi yah kanoon samaapt nahin hua lekin ise samaapt karne kii baat karne waalon ne bhi irom sharmila ko bhula diya
 Remembering Irom, the leaders also did not tell Kashmir that if there is a protest, there is a way
 irom sharmila par aatmahatya ke prayaas ke kai aarope bhi hai
 While stating his decision, he said that the government is not listening to his voice and has been crushing the movement
 isliye dilli ko sunaane ke liye wo raajnneeti main aaengi
 So long endurance even after such a long fast
 kaayade se sansad ko tarif kerani chahie is baat ke baavjood ki irom kii maang se ham asahmat hai lekin unke shantipurna or ahimsak raste kaa sammaan karte hai
 On 7 January 2015, Irom told the Wall Street Journal that she wanted to enter a normal life
 ve sant yaa devi nahin bananaa chaahatin
 Shanti wants to be the messenger of love and truth
 tippaniyan i do not know but i have read in the newspapers that Irom even continued to love someone during this long struggle
 desmund kautinho
 There was also a dispute about this connection
 unke andolan ko samarthan karne waalon ne desmund par aarope lagaaya ki wo irom sharmila ko bahaka rahaa he or AFSPA hataane ke andolan ko kamazor kar rahaa he
 We lack something
 jo andolan karte hai ham samajhate hai wo saans bhi nahin lete honge
 They would not even sing songs
 irom ne kisi se kuch nahin bataaya
 Just as his mother had no idea when he was fasting, his 84-year-old mother was also unaware of the decision to break the fast
 unki maa kaa pran tha ki jab tak AFSPA hatega nahin tab tak ve anshan par baithi apni beti se nahin milengi
 The 16-year fast is ending
 chunavi raajnneeti irom sharmila ke liye kitni jagah banaaegi, lekin isamen bhi wo ek bada sandesh de rahi hai
 The same youth who runs away from elections
 kya irom sharmila kaa anshan samaapt karne kaa faisla bataata he ki unka sangharsh bekaar rahaa, bhartiya rajya vyavastha ke saamne ek vyakti kii takat kaa yahi anjaam hota he yaa kuch or baat bhi he
 After all, why Irom's decision could not be knocked like a big event
 jab tak wo anshan par raheen har andolan ke charam or dhiraj kii misaal banakar raheen
 What happened is that we and you now refrain from awarding such democratic struggles
 film and television istitute of india, hyderabad uniwarsity or jawahar laal nehru vishvavidhyalay ke chaatr andolanon kii awaz sansad tak pahunchi, koob takaraaren huin magar ye andolan dhire dhire thande padane lage
 There are so many forms of government power that it is difficult for small groups to stand in front of it
 chaatr raajnneeti ko lekar tamaam sarkarein or raajnneetik dal sust ho chuke the
 But recent student conflicts put political parties on alert
 shaayad yahi vajah rahi hogi ki media or ritair naukarshahon ke zariye baar baar kaha jane laga ki chaatr collejon main padhane aate hai
 Do not come to do politics
 mantri tak bolne lage ki chaatro ko raajnneeti se dur rahanaa chahie
 They continue to sell tales of their youth, but do not want others to have the opportunity to narrate the anecdote that he had gone to the movement during college days
 jis desh kii azaadi kaa itihaas collejon main padhane vaale kai naujavaanon ke awaz uthaane se bharaa hua he ki kaise un yuvaaon ne kitaaben padhin, likhin, laathiyaan khain, jail gaye or faansee par chadh gaye
 In the same country, a retired bureaucrat, TSR Subrahmanyam Committee report, said that demonstrations, agitations, encirclement and other obstructing activities are increasing in the campus
 iske kaaran pariksha main deree hoti he or imtihaan sthagit hote hai
 The small group of politically active students creates such disruption
 ruthika chopra kii report kii hedline he ki campus main raajnneetik gatividhiyon ko simit kiya jaae
 One day another retired bureaucrat will come to report that people in the society have come to eat and die, not to agitate, it hurts the government
 gujarat main patel or dalit andolanon ko avaidh ghoshit kar degaa
 Without going to these questions, you cannot understand the extent and possibility of Irom Sharmila's story
 isliye aap itani aasaani se nahin samaj sakate ki kis tarah raajnneetik dal pradarshan karne kaa adhikaar sirf apane tak hi surakshit rakhana chaahate hai
 They take every step to declare the sit-in demonstration of citizens illegal and not give them space
 media ab in pradarshnon ko vyavdhaan kii tarah pesh karata he
 Cites the reason for the traffic jam
 ek pal ke liye sochiye ki agar chaatro, kisaanon mazaduron ke pradarshnon kii vaidhata nahin bachegi to tab kya hoga jab kisi mudde par saare raajnneetik dal haath mila len
 Silence after raising voice har shahar se dharna pradarshan kii jagahon ko samaapt kiya ja rahaa he
 There is talk of not allowing politics on campus
 to raajnneeti kahaan hogi
 In a beauty parlor or gymkhana club
 yahi kaaran he netaaon ne pradarshan kaa thikaana badal liya he
 They now surround each other's homes in Delhi
 jantar mantar kam jate hai
 The sit-in sit-in protesters do not surround them when they will raise our voice
 samuhik rup se nagarikon ke pradarshnon ko, andolanon ko vikaas virdohi bataakar ansuna karne kaa chalan badhata ja rahaa he
 In such a situation, continue a personal struggle for 16 years, although it has got the support of many people, but it seems no less than a wonder
 agar hamaare bheetar loktantrikta dhadkati he to irom sharmila kii kahani kyon nahin dhadkati he
 Talking from the point of view of the leaders, the democracy of India is becoming from greatest to greatest, at what point will this struggle of Irom Sharmila be placed in that great democracy
 main aapako irom ke bare main kuch bataanaa chahta hum
 Irom Sharmila would have been 42 years old, the Imphal girl has nine siblings
 saadhaaran mazdoor parivaar kii yah ladki teen baar main dasvin paas karti he lekin barahavin main fail hone ke baad wo apane pairon par khadaa hone kaa faisla karti he
 After learning typing and tailoring, she studies journalism
 imphal ke akhabaaron main uskaa kollam chhapane lagata he
 While writing poems in her diaries, Irom Sharmila begins to see the cruel faces of society and power scattered in Manipur
 cycle se shahar or gaanv naapane lagati he
 Becomes an intern for a human rights organization and investigates the effects of AFSPA legislation
 irom har brihastpivar ko upwas karti thim
 On one such Thursday, when she returns home on a bicycle, it is learned that 10 people have been killed in an encounter with the Assam Rifles in Malom
 inamen 60 saal kii ek mahila thi or 17 saal kaa ek ladkaa
 This is the incident of 2 November 2000
 us raat irom ne ek kaagaz par likhaa tha ki shanti kii shuruyaat kahaan or ant kahaan hoga
 Irom decided that she would go on hunger strike
 kisi ko pataa nahin chalaa ki irom agle 16 saal tak ke liye lambey upwas par baithne vaali hai
 i have taken this information from Deepti Priya Mehrotra's book titled Irom Sharmila and the adventure journey of Manipur people
 yah kitaab hindi main bhi he
 There is also a demonstration in Manipur against the Armed Forces Special Powers Act and voices are raised against it in Kashmir too
 irom kaa rasta kashmir kii awaazon se bilkul alag he
 Even though this law was not abolished, those who spoke of abolishing it also forgot Irom Sharmila
 netaaon ne bhi irom ko yaad kar kashmir ko nahin bataaya ki virodh hi karnaa he to ek rasta yah bhi he
 Irom Sharmila is also facing several charges of attempted suicide
 apana faisla bataate hue unhone kaha ki sarkaar unki awaz sun nahin rahi he or andolan ko kuchalati rahi he
 So she will come to politics to tell Delhi
 itane lambey upwas ke baad bhi itnaa lanbaa dhiraj
 Parliament should be commended for its rule, despite the fact that we disagree with Irom's demand but respect his peaceful and non-violent path
 7 janvari 2015 ko wal street jarnal se irom ne kaha tha ki ve saamaanya jivan main pravesh karnaa chaahati hai
 She does not want to be a saint or a goddess
 shanti pyaar or satya kaa doot bananaa chaahati hai
 The comments main nahin jaanata magar akhabaaron main padhaa he ki is lambey sangharsh ke dauraan irom kisi se pyaar bhi karti raheen
 Desmond Koutinho
 is tallukaat ko lekar vivaad bhi hua
 Those who supported his movement accused Desmond of misleading Irom Sharmila and weakening the AFSPA removal movement
 kuch kami hamaari he
 Those who do the movement, we understand that they will not even breathe
 geet bhi nahin gaate honge
 Irom told nothing to anyone
 jis tarah se upwas par baithte samay unki maa ko andaaza nahin tha, usee tarah upwas todane ke faisle kii jaankaree bhi unki 84 saal kii maa ko nahin thi
 Her mother's pledge was that she would not meet her daughter on hunger strike until AFSPA was removed
 16 saal kaa anshan samaapt ho rahaa he
 How much space will electoral politics create for Irom Sharmila, but in this too she is giving a big message
 usee yuva ko jo chunaavon se bhaagta he
 Does Irom Sharmila's decision to end the fast show that their struggle was in vain, is this the result of a person's strength in the face of Indian polity or is it something else
 ek din koi or ritair naukarshah aayega jo report degaa ki samaaj main log khaane kamaane or marane aae hai, andolan karne nahin, isse sarkaar ko nuksaan hota he
 Will declare Patel and Dalit movements illegal in Gujarat
 bina in sawaalon par gaye aap irom sharmila kii kahani kii seemaa or sambhaavna ko nahin samaj sakate hai
 Therefore, you cannot easily understand how political parties want to protect their right to perform only to themselves
 ve nagarikon ke dharna pradarshan ko avaidh ghoshit karne or unhen jagah na dene kaa har upaay karte hai
 The media now presents these protests as a disruption
 trephic jam kaa kaaran bataata he
 For a moment, think that if the legitimacy of the demonstrations of students and peasants workers will not remain, then what will happen when all political parties join hands on an issue

 dilli main ab ve ek duusare ke gharon ko gherte hai
 Jantar Mantar goes less
 vahaan pehle se baithe dharne vaale kahin unhen na gher len ki hamaari awaz kab uthaaoge
 The practice of collectively ignoring the protests of the citizens, the movements as anti-development, is increasing
 aise main koi vyaktigat sangharsh ko 16 saal tak jari rakhen, beshak use kai logon kaa samarthan mila ho lekin yah kisi ajoobe se kam nahin lagata
 If democracy beats within us then why the story of Irom Sharmila does not beats

 This is the incident of 2 November 2000
 us raat irom ne ek kaagaz par likhaa tha ki shanti kii shuruyaat kahaan or ant kahaan hoga
 Irom decided that she would go on hunger strike
 kisi ko pataa nahin chalaa ki irom agle 16 saal tak ke liye lambey upwas par baithne vaali hai
 i have taken this information from Deepti Priya Mehrotra's book titled Irom Sharmila and the adventure journey of Manipur people
 yah kitaab hindi main bhi he
 There is also a demonstration in Manipur against the Armed Forces Special Powers Act and voices are raised against it in Kashmir too
 irom kaa rasta kashmir kii awaazon se bilkul alag he
 Even though this law was not abolished, those who spoke of abolishing it also forgot Irom Sharmila
 netaaon ne bhi irom ko yaad kar kashmir ko nahin bataaya ki virodh hi karnaa he to ek rasta yah bhi he
 Irom Sharmila is also facing several charges of attempted suicide
 apana faisla bataate hue unhone kaha ki sarkaar unki awaz sun nahin rahi he or andolan ko kuchalati rahi he
 So she will come to politics to tell Delhi
 itane lambey upwas ke baad bhi itnaa lanbaa dhiraj
 Parliament should be commended for its rule, despite the fact that we disagree with Irom's demand but respect his peaceful and non-violent path
 7 janvari 2015 ko wal street jarnal se irom ne kaha tha ki ve saamaanya jivan main pravesh karnaa chaahati hai
 She does not want to be a saint or a goddess
 shanti pyaar or satya kaa doot bananaa chaahati hai
 The comments main nahin jaanata magar akhabaaron main padhaa he ki is lambey sangharsh ke dauraan irom kisi se pyaar bhi karti raheen
 Desmond Koutinho
 is tallukaat ko lekar vivaad bhi hua
 Those who supported his movement accused Desmond of misleading Irom Sharmila and weakening the AFSPA removal movement
 kuch kami hamaari he
 Those who do the movement, we understand that they will not even breathe
 geet bhi nahin gaate honge
 Irom told nothing to anyone
 jis tarah se upwas par baithte samay unki maa ko andaaza nahin tha, usee tarah upwas todane ke faisle kii jaankaree bhi unki 84 saal kii maa ko nahin thi
 Her mother's pledge was that she would not meet her daughter on hunger strike until AFSPA was removed
 16 saal kaa anshan samaapt ho rahaa he
 How much space will electoral politics create for Irom Sharmila, but in this too she is giving a big message
 usee yuva ko jo chunaavon se bhaagta he
 Does Irom Sharmila's decision to end the fast show that their struggle was in vain, is this the result of a person's strength in the face of Indian polity or is it something else
 maine ye jaankaree dipti priya mehrotra kii kitaab se lee he jiskaa naam he irom sharmila or manipur janata kii saahas yatra
 This book is also in Hindi
 armd forces special power act ke khilaaf manipur main bhi pradarshan ho rahaa he or kashmir main bhi iske kilaaf awaazen uthati hai
 The path of Irom is completely different from the sounds of Kashmir
 bhale hi yah kanoon samaapt nahin hua lekin ise samaapt karne kii baat karne waalon ne bhi irom sharmila ko bhula diya
 Remembering Irom, the leaders also did not tell Kashmir that if there is a protest, there is a way
 irom sharmila par aatmahatya ke prayaas ke kai aarope bhi hai
 While stating his decision, he said that the government is not listening to his voice and has been crushing the movement
 isliye dilli ko sunaane ke liye wo raajnneeti main aaengi
 So long endurance even after such a long fast
 kaayade se sansad ko tarif kerani chahie is baat ke baavjood ki irom kii maang se ham asahmat hai lekin unke shantipurna or ahimsak raste kaa sammaan karte hai
 On 7 January 2015, Irom told the Wall Street Journal that she wanted to enter a normal life
 ve sant yaa devi nahin bananaa chaahatin
 Shanti wants to be the messenger of love and truth
 tippaniyan i do not know but i have read in the newspapers that Irom even continued to love someone during this long struggle
 desmund kautinho
 There was also a dispute about this connection
 unke andolan ko samarthan karne waalon ne desmund par aarope lagaaya ki wo irom sharmila ko bahaka rahaa he or AFSPA hataane ke andolan ko kamazor kar rahaa he
 We lack something
 jo andolan karte hai ham samajhate hai wo saans bhi nahin lete honge
 They would not even sing songs
 irom ne kisi se kuch nahin bataaya
 Just as his mother had no idea when he was fasting, his 84-year-old mother was also unaware of the decision to break the fast
 unki maa kaa pran tha ki jab tak AFSPA hatega nahin tab tak ve anshan par baithi apni beti se nahin milengi
 The 16-year fast is ending
 chunavi raajnneeti irom sharmila ke liye kitni jagah banaaegi, lekin isamen bhi wo ek bada sandesh de rahi hai
 The same youth who runs away from elections
 kya irom sharmila kaa anshan samaapt karne kaa faisla bataata he ki unka sangharsh bekaar rahaa, bhartiya rajya vyavastha ke saamne ek vyakti kii takat kaa yahi anjaam hota he yaa kuch or baat bhi he

 ) pichley kuch saalon main deshbhar main kamedi ke paryaayavachi banakar ubhare kapil sharma kaa kariyar abtak sabase mushkil daur main hai
 The market of all kinds of discussions and rumors about them is hot
 log jaananaa chaahate hai ki aakhir aisa kya hua jo teen episod ke baad hi kamedi king ke nae sho 'family time vid kapil sharma' ko suspend karnaa padaa? kapil ke kareebi iske peeche sajeesh kii ashanka dekh rahe hai to unki purv manager or team main rahe log ise kapil kii manamaani or maansik avasthaa se jod rahe hai
 Many characters and their roles are coming out
 ab tak priti simos, niti, vicky lalavaani or kapil ke kai karibiyon ke bayaan saamne aae hai
 Preeti has once again advised Kapil to go to the Rehab Center, while Neeti has written an open letter saying that 'we are heartily trying to help Kapil Sharma since year
' is ham main kahin na kahin niti kii bahan priti bhi shaamil hai, jo kapil kii purv manager thim or kathith taur par kamedian ke saath unke afaire kii khabaren bhi saamne aa chuki hai
 Niti also wants to meet Kapil, although in any direct conversation with Kapil, Niti considers the presence of his lawyers and police necessary
 niti aakhir kis tarah se kapil kii madad karnaa chaahati hai? kapil ke liye to is vakt sabase badi madad yah hoti ki unke puraane jakhmon ko kurede bina unke haal par chhod diya jaataa
 But the statements of policy and love can be considered sufficient for Kapil's behavior or provocation
 darasal, pichley bayaan main priti, kapil ko mental qaraar detii najar ain
 He said, Kapil knows about suicide
 unhen phir se rihaib centre jane kii jarurat he
 If you look closely at the current chapter in the Kapil episode, this time the Simos sisters are seen to a large extent behind the reason for the dispute
 aisi sthiti ke liye kapil kii apni aadaten bhi kam jimmedaar nahin hai
 However, this time only one shoot of the celebrity was canceled, behind which Kapil had his reasons
 tiger ke shoot ko lekar unhone saarvajanik twit kar bataaya bhi ki sachai kya he
 Kapil's co-star revealed that the shooting of the show was not done for 10 days, it is said that the dispute has been going on since a year ago when Kapil announced his relationship with Ginni
 anounsament se priti naakhush bataai gayi
 But her sister rejects the news of policy relations
 kai reports main to yahaan tak likhaa gaya ki priti ne kapil ko ginni ke saath is tarah ke rishton ke khataron se aagaah kiya tha
 At the same time, Kapil's dispute with Sunil Grover in the flight also came to light, due to which Kapil's team got cracks
 phir kya hua yah bataane kii jarurat nahin
 After the team broke up, a lot of things went against Kapil
 shoot cancel hona, zyada sharaab pinaa or shaareerik rup se thake hone kii vajah se channel ne kapil ke sho ko pehle of air kiya or baad main band karne kii ghoshnaa kii
 Then came Kapil's Firangi and flopped badly
 sunil se vivaad or firangi ke flop hone tak kapil ke saath jo kuch hua usamen ek achche kalakaar kaa, bhavishya ke khataron ko lekar ashankit hona swaabhaavik tha
 Kiku, who came in support, said - is being made against Kapil
 Atmosphere Kapil also regretted his mistake of allegedly slapping Sunil
 ye bataanaa jaruri he ki kapil ne darjanon baar saarvajanik manchon se sunil se maafee maangi or ek baar phir unke saath kaam karne kii ichha jataai
 However, throughout this period, the controversy related to Sunil, Kapil and the question of coming together again seemed to remain silent
 lekin, 2018 main jaise hi kapil ke nae tivi sho kii anounsament hui or uske promo saamne aae sunil kaa chapter najar aayaa
 Sunil Grover retweeted a question from a fan and named Kapil Sharma for the first time in a year
 unhone likhaa ki main bhi is sho (family time vid kapil sharma sho) main unke saath kaam karnaa chahta tha
 i waited for his call
 jab koi kol nahin aayaa to maine kal hi nayaa sho (jeeyo dhan dhana dhan) jwine kar liya
 This retweet of Sunil was done on 16 March
 mjedaar yah he ki firangi kii relies ke vakt duniya jahaan ne kapil ko twit kar badhai di lekin sunil ne kuch nahin likhaa
 In his interviews, he kept avoiding questions related to Kapil
 sunil kaa achaanak twit kai sawaal khadey karata he
 In fact, according to Sunil, he signed the cricket-based comedy show 'dhan Dhana Dhan' a day before
 ipel ko lekar ye bada sho kya ek din pehle dizin kiya gaya tha? yun short notice par kaise koi sho taiyaar kiya ja saktaa he? yani sunil kaa yah kahana ki main intjaar kar rahaa tha or kal (15 march ko) sho jwine kar liya, ise aasaani se khaarij karne ke paryaapt tark hai
 That is, Sunil was already preparing for this show
 mjedaar yah he ki sunil ke is sho main kapil ke saath kam kar chuke kuch puraane log bhi hai
 The most interesting names are that of Preeti and Niti Simos
 bataa den ki sunil ke web sho ko lil frodo productions ne produs kiya he, jise priti or niti milakar chalaati hai
 After Sunil's tweet, the kind of reports that went on till the show came, they must have been Kapil's old wounds
 nishchit hi kapil ke ird-gird bhi in chizon kii hi charchaa hoti rahi hogi
 After this, the way Kapil's negative reviews of the show came out, Kapil got badly burnt
 kapil kii najar main iske peeche simos bahanen thim
 He tweets and abuses
 darasal, simos chapter kapil ke maujuuda vivaad main kis tarah sawaalon ke ghere main he iskaa andaja vicky lalavaani ke saath kapil kii viral audio ko sunakar bhi lagaaya ja saktaa he
 Kapil takes Priti's name and tries to say that Preity has been constantly running negative news against her in Vicky's website 'spotboy'
 bataate chalem ki kapil kaa sho cancel hone par soni ko hone vaale nuksaan se judi khabar bhi 'spotboy' par hi chali thi
 Kapil's friend and his film director Rajeev Dhingra also said in a recent interview that Preity was the one who instigated her friends (possibly Sunil) against Kapil
 juuta markar kapil bhul gaye par juuta khaane vaala ab tak us ghatana ko ganth baadhe hue he
 So did the Simos sisters quarrel Kapil's old wounds to promote Sunil's show? Many questions are yet to be answered
 ummid he kapil is mushkil se paar paa lenge

 Twenty-five-year-old Punita's maiden and in-laws used to walk out of the walls of the house earlier, but their journey was limited to only farm to house and farm to house
 paanch saal pehle shaadi ke baad jab punitha ne apana beauty parlor kholane kii baat kahi to gharavaalon ko jaise jhatka laga
 68-year-old Kamala Devi, Punita's mother-in-law, arose, "the daughter-in-law of the house will work

 No one is unaware of the anti-female Khapans' decrees, but irrespective of their fear, now the girls and women of this village are grooming their eyebrows, hair and face

 The TV did not even come in the village then

 But today, whether it is a woman working in the fields, a beard worker or a young girl studying in an inter-college, everyone comes to Sushma's beauty parlor

 The women of the village have also advanced

 The family members protested a lot, the society looked at it with a crooked eye, but when four paisa of their earnings are in hand, everyone's mouth is closed
 manochikitsak sudhir kakkad kehete hai, ''aap hameshaa bazaar par pitrusattatmak hone kaa aarope lagaakar uski aalochana nahin kar sakate
 Of course, men are owned there, but to a large extent the same market has driven women out of the feudal quadruple of the family

 Taking a month also trains beautician to minor families and girls from lower castes

 "what if in-laws were not allowed after marriage?" She says, "don't care
" main unhen samajhauungi, jarurat padi to ladachgi bhi, lekin kaam karuungi jarur
 Where did this courage come from a girl from eastern Uttar Pradesh? The girls of this society did not speak like this

 They have started feeling that the world of working, earning money is better than the world of stove
 ye aatmavishvaas or sapane unki ankhon main padhe ja sakate hai
 When did these dreams permeate in the lives of girls from far-flung villages? Kumkum Pandey of Pahitipur village of Ambedkar Nagar, a district in eastern Uttar Pradesh, left the in-laws to insist on taking a beauty parlor course
 vanchit jatiyon kii striyaan to phir bhi kheton main kaam karti rahi hai, lekin brahman-thakur parivaar kii auraten din ke ujaale main ghar ke dwaar par bhi khadi nahin hotin

 Kamala says, "most women come here to get threading done

 The NIA investigation has revealed that Abdullah Rashid, the main mastermind of Kerala ISIS module, is trying to instigate Kerala youth by forming Telegram Group
 iske kehane par hi kareeb dedh darjan se zyada logon ne afghanistan jaakar iesas ke modul ko jwine kiya tha
 According to NIA sources, Mohammad Abdullah Rashid is present in Afghanistan
 vah 'gold dinaar 4' ke naam se ek telegram group ko oparate karata he
 In it, he also talks about joining the youth of Kerala to ISIS
 vah kahata he ki india main vaayalence failaana he
 It has also claimed in this Telegram Group that hundreds of ISIS supporters are present in Kerala
 enie ne is par jaanch karte hue mohammad raashid abdulla ke gold dinaar 1, gold dinaar 2 or gold dinaar 3 naamak telegram group ko pehle hi delit karvaa diya he
 Mohammed Rashid Abdullah, the main mastermind of the Kerala module, is continuously engaged in creating new telegram groups to join ISIS and encourage the youth of Kerala
 pichley saal november ke maheene main bhi abdulla raashid ne ISIS ke dhamkee bhare audio clip jari kiye the
 In the clip, there was an attack on Kumbh Mela and Thrissur Puram (hindu festival celebrated in Kerala)
 ye donon meley aise hai, jahaan baari sankhya main shraddhalu jutate hai
 The audio clip that was revealed was in Malayalam language
 is clip main ek aatanki bharat main maujuud apane samarthakon ko bhadkaa rahaa tha
 It was none other than Abdullah Rashid
 ek baar phir is tareeke kaa audio clip telegram group main jari karke wo kerala ke yuvakon ko bhadakaane main juta he
 Last year, the NIA filed a charge sheet against two ISIS operatives Abdul Rashid Abdullah and Yasmin Mohammad Zahid
 isamen abdulla mukhya aaropee tha
 He inspired many youths of Kasargod, including his family, to leave the country and join the Islamic State
 yasmine mohammad jaahid ko kabul ke liye vimaan pakadaney ke dauraan hiraasat me liya gaya tha
 She was going to Afghanistan to join IS
 enie kii jaanch main yah baat sabit hui he ki abdul raashid abdulla is maamle main mukhya shadyantr karta he
 This prompted many youths from Kasaragod to leave India and join the Islamic State, including family
 vah kaasragod or anya sthanon par is aatankwaadi sanghathan or isaki vichaardhaara ke samarthan main class yojit karata tha
 The banned Pakistani terrorist organization Jamaat ud Dawa held a huge rally in Lahore on the occasion of Kashmir Unity Day
 jamaat-ud-daawa ke mukhiya or mumbai hamalon ke aaropee hafiz said ne kaha ki bharat kashmir par daawa chode yaa badi ladaai ke liye taiyaar rahe
 Several other parties also took out the rally at the rally
 is maukey par pakistan kii rajdhani islamabad main bhi raily hui
 Kashmir Unity Day is observed in Pakistan on 5 February
 bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) ne koyala block aavanton ke mudde par apana hamalaa or tej karte hue mangalvaar ko phir se pradhanmantri manmohan singh or koyala mantri shriprakash jaiswal ko nishaanaa banaaya
 The party demanded the cancellation of all coal allocations and a special inquiry team constituted under the supervision of the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) to examine it
 bhaajapa pravaktaa ravishankar prasad ne kaha, 'bade aashcharya kii baat he ki sanyukt pragatisheel gathbandhan (samprag) sarkaar main shaamil mantriyon ke mantri banane ke baad unke bhai bade vyavsaayee ban gaye
 Prasad was speaking in the context of recent revelations regarding Union Tourism Minister Subodh Kant Sahay and former Coal Minister Santosh Bagdodia
 sahay ne apane bhai kii company ko koyala block aavantit kiye jane ke liye pradhanmantri ko khat likhaa tha vahiin neshnal thermal power coporation (antipisi) dwaara ek sanyukt upkram ko aavantit koyala khadaan main bagadodiya parivaar kii 10 fisadi hissedari thi
 He said that it should be investigated how the Rs 26000 crore coal mine agreement was given to the joint venture in which the Bagdodia family has a stake
 prasad ne kaha ki kai companiyon ko koyala block aavanton hua jinhone sachai chhupaai or jo iske laayak nahin the
 He demanded that all 142 coal block allocations be canceled and a special inquiry team constituted under the supervision of the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) be investigated
 unhone kaha, 'pradhanmantri ji in sabhi karaaron par bataur koyala mantri hastakshar kar rahe the
 The final allocation is only when the minister signs
 kya aapane aisa karne se pehle jaanch kii thi
 ' bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ke vayovruddh netaa atal bihari vaajapeyi kii viraasat ke sahare sansad main pahunchane kii koshish main jute bhaajapa ke rashtriya adhyaksh rajnath singh brahman or muslim sameekaran kii fans main funs gaye hai
 According to political analysts and experts, the current equations are visible only against Rajnath, because if the Brahmins' vote shifts from BJP, then Rajnath's defeat is almost certain
 upi kii rajdhani main virodhiyon ne bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh rajnath kii gherebandi kaaphi kaayade se kii he
 Nakul Dubey from Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), Abhishek Mishra from Samajwadi Party (SP) and former state president Rita Bahuguna Joshi from Congress
 congress netri joshi ne varsh 2009 ke aam chunaav main bijepi ke ummidavaar lalji tandon ko kadi takkar di thi or vah lagbhag 40 hajaar maton se hi chunaav haari thim
 This time she will not want to leave any core work
 rajdhani main sameekaran is kadar bane hai ki rajnath ko rajdhani kii galiyon ke chakkar lagane hi padenge, varanaa atal ke garh main hi rajnath ko munh kii khaani padegi
 Talking about the figures, there are three lakh Brahmin voters in the capital
 dedh lakh pahari matadaata hai or iske alaava muslim matadaataaon kii sankhya chaar lakh ke aasapaas he
 The number of Thakur voters is only around 60 thousand and it will not be easy for Rajnath to win the war of Lucknow with the help of Kshatriyas
 raajnneetik vishleshkon kaa maananaa he ki yadi lakhanu main koi bada muslim cheharaa maidan main nahin utarataa he, to lakhanu sansadeey seat par palada reeta bahuguna joshi kaa hi baari rahane kii sambhaavna he
 According to analysts, if no candidate came from the Muslim community, then the polarization of Muslims would be in favor of the one who would be in a position to defeat the BJP candidate
 joshi khud brahman sumadaay se hai or uttarakhand se judi hai, isliye indira nagar or uske aasapaas rahane vaale pahari logon kaa mat unase jud saktaa he
 Rita also defeated Tandon in the Cantt assembly in the last election
 iske alaava calraj mishra ko devaria bhej die jane kii vajah se bhi lakhanu kaa brahman samudaay rajnath se khafa he
 Since Tandon's ticket was cut, the party is already struggling at a local level
 is lihaaj se rajnath kii raah aasaan nahin hone vaali
 The SP chief has already cleared the path of Rajnath by fielding Abhishek Mishra in Lucknow
 pichley dedh saal se ashok vaajapeyi din raat mehnat kar rahe the lekin rajnath kii ummidavaari ghoshit hone ke saath hi sapa ne yahaan ummidavaar badal diya
 There is speculation that this exercise has been done by SP only to make the path of Rajnath easy
 vartmaan sameekaran ko dekhte hue is chunaav main lakhanu sansadeey seat par jeet kii chaabi musalamaanon ke paas hi rahane vaali he
 If no Muslim face falls in the field, then the polarization of Muslims is almost certain to be in favor of Joshi and in such a situation, Rajnath's plans can be watered down
 lakhanu ke varisht patrkaar or raajnneetik vishleshak sharat pradhan bhi is baat ko sweekaar karte hai ki philhal reeta bahuguna kii ummidavaari kaaphi majboot dikh rahi he
 He said, 'in Lucknow, Mulayam Singh has left the ground open for Rajnath
 rajnath kii ummidavaari ghoshit hone ke 24 ghante ke bheetar ummidavaar badla janaa yahi darshata he ki unhone rajnath ko sef paisej de diya he
 Pradhan said that the position of Abhishek Mishra is not of the stature of Ashok Vajpayee
