 The JDU National Executive meeting is scheduled to be held in Delhi on Saturday and Sunday for the Prime Ministerial candidate

 This is the reason that other opposition parties, including BJP, the main constituent of NDA, are also eyeing this meeting

 The RJD, however, considers neither bjp's LK Advani nor Narendra Modi to be the prime ministerial candidate
 argedy ke mahasachiv or saansad ramkripal yadav ne kaha ki nitish dharmanirpeksh chhavi vaale netaa kii baat kar rahe hai, lekin vah puure desh ko sampradayikta kii aag main dhakelne vaale adwani ko acha netaa bataa rahe hai

 baithak main jo bhi nirnay hoga, vah sabhi ke saamne hoga
 Well, there is no hurry now
 abhi to kisi party ne pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar tay nahin kiya he
 In such a situation, do not be so hasty
 'udhar, congress netaa umakant singh ne kaha ki nitish bijepi ko chhodkar sampradayik shaktiyon ke khilaaf ladane aaen to nae raajnneetik sameekaran par vichaar kiya jayega
 He said that Nitish is currently with communal powers
 dilli main hone vaali baithak main kya hota he, yah dekhnaa hoga
 Meanwhile, a JDU leader said that in the meeting, the party can send a clear message to the bjp-led NDA that it will not accept a person with a communal image for the post of Prime Minister
 jediu ke kai netaa vibhinn maukon par yah spasht kar chuke hai ki unhen pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar ke rup main gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi sweekaarya nahin hai
 Asked about the Prime Ministerial candidate by NDA, Nitish said on Monday that everything will be decided in the JDU meeting in Delhi on Saturday and Sunday

 naam- sudhir kumaar makkad urf golden baboumr- 54 saalpahchaan- mahant, panchadashnam june akhaada, barelibaba kii jindagi virodhabhas kaa kitna bada pitara he, ye baba kii ye pahchaan hi apane-aap bataa detii he
 To say that Baba is a Mahant, he runs an arena
 santon kii jindagi jite hai
 But this Baba also has a past
 ye ateet baba ke us vyapaar kaa he
 To commit crime under the guise
 lekin ye shaayadbaba kii khaasiyatahi he ki baba ne sirf gunaah kiya hi nahin, khule dil se kubula bhi
 Baba is an old historyheater of East Delhi
 historishit bole to thane main kholaa gaya baba ke naam kaa wo bahi-khaataa jisamen unke tamaam chote-bade gunahon kaa puraa hisaab-kitaab darj hai
 And in the name of any person, a police historyheater is prepared only when the police believe that this man cannot improve and he is the habitual criminal of the person
 yani peshewar gunahagaar or ittefaq se apane golden baba ke saath bhi kuch aisi hi baat he
 About 3 dozen lawsuits against Golden Baba, how Baba is in the world of crimes, it is only from this one thing that at this time, almost three dozen cases of crimes against Baba are going on in different courts
 And these cases include kidnapping, extortion, extortion, assault, threat of death, and many small and big crimes
 aaj golden baba beshak apane jism par karodon ke jevar lad kar ghoomte hon, har oongli par sone kii anguuthiyaan pahante hon or kabhi-kabhi sone kii shart se bhi apana man bahalaate hon, lekin golden baba ne bhi kabhi phaka kiya karte the
 In such a situation, it is not difficult to understand that in the journey of Baba starting from the clamshell to playing in crores, how Baba must have fed the flowers and collected so much wealth
 darji kaa kaam karte the golden babadarasal, baba purvi dilli ke gandhinagar ilaake ke rahanevaale hai, usee gandhinagar ke jahaan kapadon kaa acha kaam he or kabhi baba gandhi nagar ke isi kapadaa market kii ekmamooli si darjihua karte the
 But people who know Baba tell that Baba's desires were very big from the beginning
 jald hi baba ne baba ne trek chanj kar liya kuch dinon tak property kaam bhi karte rahe
 But in the meantime, one day Baba disappeared and settled directly in Haridwar
 phir jab vahaan se laute to baba kaa nayaa avatar saamne aa chukaa tha
 Now, after leaving the water, Baba was engaged in Manabagiri
 baba ne gandhinagar main mandir banavaa liya or dhire-dhire ise ashram main badal kar khud iske mahant ban baithe
 But despite becoming a Mahant, the glow of gold tempted Baba
 baba ashram ke liye daan bhi lete to sone kii shakl main, or kuch isi tarah baba ne itnaa sona batora ki is sone ne raaton-raat baba ko golden baba bana diya

 But later all this proved to be a rumor
 Once there was a country girl who dreamt of being a princess , she made tiny stories in her head playing in her own company about a prince who would come on a horse and take her far far away , as time went by she grew up and went to the city the girl realised that the world we live in is not kind to princesses and every girl needed to become her own hero to survive , to fight the competition at work , to fight for her identity every step despite her million achievements, to work like a man and to love like a dog she has to not stop despite what life may throw at her 
 So the girl wiped her own tears and fought the battle, she ran and climbed and fell and stood up and ran and conquered, till she became a queen
 She did the impossible and faced the unheard and reigned supreme , and then again it was life's turn to show her that she is just a small town girl and not a powerful queen , so life played its most devilish card and took her beloved father away, the man who was her inspiration to live, the man who's language she spoke and the world applauded her,he was her hero and her hero was gone
 The girl lost all desire to fight, the colors seems to fade away and all lacked lustre
 Then her hero from the sky sent her a prayer , he sent her a blessing , there came a country boy , raw and rustic , tanned skinned scar faced, with his childlike innocence and his calming maturity he fit into her being like a jigsaw puzzle , he loved her and healed her broken heart , he gave her so much love that all her broken pieces joined back together , he made her feel beautiful everyday and never let her shed a tear again 
 You know what happened to the girl? She became a princess üë∏, because a woman becomes a reflection of what her man thinks of her, she became a princess as she knew her protector has come

 Recently, a student was sued in IIT Delhi and this news once again started raising the pressure of continuous education on children
 iaiti ke entrens ke liye bachche 3 se 4 saal kadi mehnat or koching karte hai
 Even after that only a few children are able to pass this most difficult exam and enter the IIT campus
 UPES shuru kar rahaa he teen nae vokational course, aise karen aplilekin campus ke jane ke baad bhi bacchon par lagaataar projects ore parikshaon kaa pressure bana rahata hai
 Due to this pressure, children take wrong steps many times
 bacchon ke isi pressure ko thodaa kam karne ke liye iaiti dilli ne apane first year ke karikulam ko revamp karne kii baat sochi hai
 v Ram Gopal Rao, Director IIT Delhi told us that talks are on to provide practical practices to the children in the first year so that after coming to campus, the children can relax and enjoy their studies
 entrens nikaalane ke liye 3 se 4 saal tak bachche kitabon or nots main hi uljhe rahete hai
 But even after going to campus, they do not get any relief, which they have to bear every moment in the form of pressure and stress
 AP SSC 10veen board: aise check karen rigelt
 
 
 The process of pressure and education started from coaching, the child continues to bear every moment
 har student ke liye is stress ko handle karnaa mumkin nahi ho paata hai or shaayad yahi vajah hai ki hamaare desh me har ghante 8 students suicide kar lete hai
 IIT Delhi, which is on the path of making changes in IIC First Year Curriculum, is thinking of taking the children from books and questions to practical studies
 
 
 
 Those who never did the job, but it was for the workers to have a strong voice but the mindset behind making suicide is just need to change that system if there are only studies or any exam
 doctors ke mutabik suicide ke peeche sirf ek hi vajah nahi hoti isiilie agar ek student suicide karata hai to uske peeche padhai ke pressure ke alaava duusari chize bhi zarur rahati hai
 The only difference between topping children in big exams and failing children is that one handles the pressure and studies the other in the pressure, now in such a situation, the children are ready for the big examinations as well as for life
 Preparations should also be made to withstand the ups and downs and losses and losses

 Under this, the Congress passed the financial bill of the government brought in the Delhi Assembly
 'aam aadmi party ne kya congress ke vot par apana kabja jamaa liya, is sawaal ke jawaab main lavali ne kaha, 'kai chijen vot bank se upar hoti hai
 The Congress is not afraid of victory or defeat, we must have made such a mistake that caused our base to slip
 ek nai-naveli party ko dilli ke logon ne pasand kiya isliye congress ne uskaa saath bhi diya
 On the question whether Kejriwal showed what he had done in Delhi, there would be a boom in the country, Lovely said, "although Kejriwal may consider himself above the constitution but after 49 days of rule, his real face has come to the fore
 araajaktaa kaa maahaul banane vaale kejariwal ko log ab samaj chuke hai, desh kii janata itani bhi naasamajh nahin he ki itane shaatiranaa chaal ko samajhakar bhi aage koi galati kare

 BJP had said that it was baseless
 Earlier, the allegations of corruption and bribery levied by the former Chief Minister of Karnataka and BJP leader BS Yeddyurappa on behalf of the Congress have been described by Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad as baseless
 ravishankar prasad ne congress ke aaropon ko bebuniyaad bataate hue kaha ki congress party jhooth failaane kii raajnneeti kar rahi he
 Ravi Shankar Prasad had said that in 2017, Karnataka Congress leader Govind Raju, who was Siddaramaiah's political advisor, was raided
 jisamen SG or RG kaa baar-baar naam aayaa tha
 After this, there was a raid on D
 Shivkumar and after this Shivkumar also handed over some pages to the Income Tax Department, on which the Congress has held a press conference
 ravishankar prasad ne iskar vibhaag ke adhikariyon kaa hawala dete hue kaha ki sivakumar ko is ghoose ke bare main khud nahin pataa, saath hi unhen asal kagajaton ke bare main nahin pataa he
 He has only submitted photocopies of the officers, before there was no complaint about such a big bribe
 sivakumar apane kaagajon kii khud bhi pushti nahin kar paae hai
 BS Yeddyurappa on Congress allegations, BS Yeddyurappa had said that Congress is making such allegations to get mileage in the media
 jo bhi aarope lagaae gaye hai vah sabhi galat hai
 Yeddyurappa said that he is talking to the lawyers on this issue and is thinking of filing a defamation case
 congress ne lagaaya tha 1800 karod rupee bhrashtachar kaa aaropawahin, congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne ek baar phir twit karke centre sarkaar par nishaanaa saadhaa tha

 bataa den ki congress ne aarope lagaaya ki karnataka ke mukhyamantri rahete hue bies yediurppa ne bijepi netaaon ko 1800 karod rupee kii rishwat di jisaki jaanch lokapal se honi chahie
 After this statement by Rahul Gandhi, party spokesperson Randeep Surjewala also targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi in this matter and said that Modi should give an immediate reply in this matter

 The second season of Netflix's popular web series Sacred Games is coming soon
 pehla sijan darshakon dwaara khub pasand kiya gaya tha or isaki vajah se bahut se logon ne netflix kaa sabsakripshan liya
 The new season of the web series features Kalki Koechlin and Ranveer Shorey
 donon ke kirdaar ab tak saaf nahin hai lekin ek baat saaf he
 
 
 And that this season many questions are going to be answered
 pichhlaa sijan jab khatm hua to kahani adhuri thi
 Many curiosities remained about the characters and the story of the show
 kai sawaal the jinke jawaab darshak jaananaa chaahate the
 The audience will get answers to most of these questions this season
 to chaliye jaanate hai ki wo koun se sawaal hai jinke jawaab darshak is sijan main talaashenge or jinke is baar jaahir hone kii ummid he
 What and what kind of threat is Mumbai has? If you remember the trailer video of the first season of the show, Ganesh Gaitonde (nawazuddin Siddiqui) calls Sartaj (saif Ali Khan) and says that you have 25 days
 
 
 bachaa lenaa apane shahar ko
 But those who watched the entire web series also did not get an answer as to what kind of danger is looming over the city of Mumbai
 sab maare jaaenge to phir kaise bachegaa trivedi?ganesh gayatonde yani navazuddin siddiki se phone karke kahata he ki sab mar jaaenge
 
 
 Only Trivedi will be left
 sho kaa pehla sijan puraa khatm hone ke baad bhi darshakon ko is sawaal kaa jawaab nahin mila ki yadi mumbai par mandara rahe khatre ke hakeekat hone par sab maare jaaenge to aakhir trivedi kis tarah se batch jayega
 The answer to this question can also be found in this season of the show
 ganesh gayatonde or sartaaj kaa conection aakhir kya he?ganesh gayatonde jab sartaaj ko phone karata he to bataata he ki vah dilbagh singh kaa dost he
 Dilbag Singh is the name of Sartaj's father
 sartaaj jab ganesh gayatonde se poochta he ki vah uske pita ko kaise jaanata he to iskaa ganesh koi saaf jawaab nahin detaa he
 Ganesh says that this is the beauty of this city
 
 
 yahaan kuch bhi ho saktaa he
 Who is the master mind of the entire game? By the end of the first season, it seems that the entire game is composed by Ganesh Gaitonde but in reality it does not happen
 kai sawaal aise rah jate hai jinase lagata he ki koi he jo ganesh gayatonde se bhi upar he
 For example, many things about Guruji's character have not been opened
 jabaki siries main unka kirdaar kaaphi ahm he
 These things will also be clear in the new season
 guruji kii bhoomika kya he?web siries ke nae sijan main pataa chalegaa ki guruji kaa is siries main aakhir kya role he
 In the last season, Guruji was seen for just a few seconds
 is baar unke kirdaar ke zyada vyapak hone kii ummid he
 It has to be seen how Pankaj Tripathi is able to impress the audience this time

 Why work out a long-term strategy when work gets out of improvisation?

 He also instigated pro-government elements to 'come' against this imaginary conspiracy as he had done in the case of Jayaprakash Narayan nearly four decades ago

 Meanwhile, in a statement issued by AIADMK chief Jayalalithaa, it is said that Pushpa has been removed from AIADMK for embarrassing the party
 tippaniyan 40-year-old Pushpa and DMK MP Siva were about to board the same flight and the two had a heated debate during the security check

 Do you want to make your boyfriend your lover? divaana bhi kuch is tarah kii vah aapke sivaay kuch or sach hi na paaen, to mohatarama pehle aapako unki najar main apni chhavi ko savanrana hoga
 It is possible that you can visit them without paying much attention and yes, it is also possible that you have to make a lot of papad for this
 lekin agar aap chaahati he ki vah bahut hi kam samay main aapako pasand karne lagen, to iske liye aapako atirikt mehtan karne kii jarurat nahin he

 The choice of two different people can also be different, so if you do not like any of their things or things, then tell them this thing instead of remaining silent

 puraani dilli kaa khaari baawali bazaar notebandi se ubarne ke liye tezi se digital ho rahaa he
 If Paytm is accepted, then payment is being made through debit / credit card
 thok vikritaon kii maane to ab 80 fisadi karidaarkashles pementkar rahe hai
 Some shops still do not have any kind of online payment option, but the number of such shops is very less
 khaari baawali ke 90 fisadi dukaan hue cashlesakhari baawali ke kareeb 90 fisadi dukaanon main aapkocashles bhugtanke alag-alag opshan mil jaaenge
 According to the wholesalers of Asia's largest market known for spices and dry fruits, the market has gained momentum by promoting cashless payments
 inke mutabik notebandi ke baad khaane-pine kii chizon main daam main koi khaas badlaav nahin aayaa he, lekin kaarobaar main ab bhi 60 fisadi kii giravat he
 Actually, not only Delhi, but retail traders from all over the country carry goods from Khari Baoli wholesale market
 lekin notebandi ke baad ekamusth saamaan le jane vaale khudara vyapaaree ab jarurat ke saamaan ko hi praathamikta de rahe hai
 Merchants are mostly preferring checks or net banking to make payments
 disambar ke duusare hafte se saamaanya hua kaarobaaramasalon ke thok vikreta ramkishan goyal ke mutabik, notebandi kaa asar november ke maheene main dikhaa tha, lekin disambar ke duusare hafte se bazaar lagbhag saamaanya he
 Although the sale is not happening as before, but everyone from hotels, restaurants to retail traders are now hesitating towards Khari Baoli
 iskaa ek kaaran khaari baawali ke kaarobaariyon kaa digital hona bhi he
 Ashok Arora, president of the Dairy Products Teders Association, said that the impact of demonetisation on the wholesale market of essential commodities has shown little
 shuruyaat main khaari baawali kaa bazaar bhi lagbhag thap ho gaya tha
 But now people have money in their pockets, there is a new currency, so from the retail merchant to the common public all the food and drink items are being purchased
 isse khaari baawali bazaar kaa kaarobaar bhi raftaar pakadaney laga he
 Demonetisation has had a major impact on luxury items
 khaari baawali ke kaarobaariyon ko ummid he ki agle dedh- do maheene main bazaar jor pakadega
 The difficulties of laborers are not happening, although there is a section of Khari Baoli market which is still a victim of demonetisation
 kaarobaar main giravat kii vajah se saamaan kii loding analoding karne vaale mazdooron ke liye kaam pehle ke mukaable kam ho gaya he
 In such a situation, his month's earnings are also half
 haath thela chalaane vaale pappu yadav ne bataaya ki notebandi se pehle 12 se 15 hajaar maheene kii kamai ho jaati thi, lekin notebandi ke baad bazaar main bhi kaam aadha ho gaya he
 Hence, the earning has also reduced by almost half
 khaari baawali sarv vyapaar mandal ke pradhan rajeev batra ke mutabik, vyapaaree or kharidaar to cashles ho rahe hai, lekin khaari baawali ke lebar class ke liye cashles hona aasaan nahin hai, kyonki inamen se zyaadaatar logon ke bank acount bhi nahin he
 In such a situation, if the wholesaler wants to give his allowance to a laborer, then he only needs cash, so it will take a lot of time for Khari Baoli to become completely cashless

 The list of heinous crimes committed by the 'sanger brothers' of Uttar Pradesh does not stop at the Unnao rape case
 apane liye nyaay kii guhaar laga rahe diaiji rank ke uttar pradesh cader ke ek ipies adhikari ram laal verma par 'senger bandhuon' ne kabhi chaar goliyaan daag di thim, jo unke seene or pet main lagi thim
 The Sengar brothers, who are very influential in Uttar Pradesh, not only lost important documents of the murderous attack on IPS officer Verma, but also postponed the hearing of the case for years
 saal 2004 main bataur police adheekshak verma ne jab unnav ke ek avaidh khanan sthal par dabish di thi, us dauraan kuldeep senger(kuldeep Singh Sengar) ke chote bhai atul senger or uske gurgey ne unhen goli maar di thi
 Kuldeep Sengar, an expelled BJP MLA and the main accused in the Unnao rape case, had created such political pressure in those days that important case diaries were stolen from the police station
 yahi vajah he ki verma kii hatya ke prayaas jaise sansanikhej maamle kii sunwaayee 15 saal baad bhi shuru nahin ho pai he
 IPS officer Ram Lal Verma, who has been hospitalized for several surgeries and months, survived by accident
 aakhirkaar kai goliyon se unhen mili jakhm bhar gaye
 Recalling the brutal attack, Verma said that he had received secret information about illegal sand mining being carried out by the Ganges banked mafia gang in Unnao
 jab vah khanan sthal par pahunche to atul senger or uske garge ne police par golibari shuru kar di
 Varma said, "I was shot four bullets (near the chest and in the stomach)
 meri kismat acchhee thi ki mujhe samay par ek aspataal le jaaya gaya
 Kuldeep Sengar, brother Atul and many of his henchmen were involved in that firing
 "unke mutabik, chaar baar ke vidhayak kuldeep senger apane rasookh kii badaulat maamle kii jaanch or mukademe kii sunwaayee ko prabhavit kiya karte the
 He insisted, "I had to file an RTI to ascertain the status of the lawsuit
 ek ipies adhikari hone ke baavjood mere saath jo hua, vah behad niraash karanevaala he
 i was almost killed while playing duty
 magar us maamle kii sunwaayee abhi tak shuru nahin hui he
 "he said," i am currently in Chennai in connection with a training
 main jab kanpur pahunchoongaa, tab aapako is maamle kii jaanch kii pragati se jude sabhi byore uplabdh karaungaa
 "verma's son Abhishek Verma also got selected as a 2016 batch IPS officer of Uttar Pradesh cadre
 sheersh police parivaar se hone ke baavjood verma nyaay paane or apane mukademe kii sunwaayee ke liye apane bete ke saath milakar sangharsh kar rahe hanyaram laal verma ke ek batch mitra va upi main padasth ek diaiji ne kaha, "sach to yah he ki senger uttar pradesh main shaktishaalee rajaneta hone ke naate is maamle kii jaanch rukvane main kaamyaab rahe hai
 Important case diaries have been stolen
 gavaahon ko dhamka diya gaya he
 The sad thing is that all this is happening in the case in which a senior IPS officer is suffering
 bharat ke pradhan nyaayadhish ko bhi verma ke maamle par sangyaan lenaa chahie
 "verma's batch friend further revealed that senior police officers are afraid to take action against Sengar who dominates the sand mining business in the state
 police ricard se pataa chalata he ki atul senger ke khilaaf unnav dushkarm peedita ke pita kii berahami se hatya sahit kai bhayanak aapraadhik maamle darj hai
 The situation is that the Lokayukta has ordered the investigation of mining scam of 125 crore against Sanger, which is also being suppressed by the authorities
 aiji rank ke ek adhikari ne naam jaahir na karne kaa aagrah karte hue bataaya, "kuldeep senger jaateey raajnneeti karanevaale netaaon ke atyant prabhaavshaalee gut ke hissaa hai
 That is why he has been powerful in every reign, political ideology does not matter to him
 " a Karnataka Administrative Service officer has registered a case of harassment against 10 senior officials, including the chief secretary of the state
 adhikari kaa aarope he ki eemaandaaree se kaam karne kii vajah se unka pichley 10 saalon main 27 baar tabadalaa kiya gaya
 Also promotion, incentive and other facilities were stopped
 adhikari kaa naam ke
 Mathai (K mathai) and he is currently the Assistant Commissioner of the Karnataka Administrative Service
 jaankaree ke mutabik rajya maanavadhikaar ayog ne ke
 Mathai (K mathai) has accepted the application, in which he has accused 10 top officials including Chief Secretary of State Vijay Bhaskar
 ke
 Mathai alleged that during his posting in Mandya, he exposed a Rs 300 crore land scam and caught a Rs 2000 crore scam in BBMP
 tabhi se netaa or adhikari unke peeche pad gaye
 Most of his allegations are on Karnataka Chief Secretary Vijay Bhaskar
 ke
 Mathai said, 'the Lokayukta did not listen to me, the Chief Secretary does not listen
 mukhyamantri mujhe vaqt nahin dete
 All the doors were closed
 isi vajah se maine rajya maanavadhikaar ayog kaa darwaja khatkhataya

 In the disproportionate assets case of former Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa, the Supreme Court has dismissed the Karnataka government's reconsideration petition
 karnataka sarkaar ne jayalalita ko bhi doshi qaraar dene or trial court ke 100 karod ke jurmaane ko barkaraar rakhane kii maang kii thi
 In February itself, the Supreme Court, while giving the verdict, had sentenced Sasikala and two of her relatives to four years of imprisonment, but separated them due to Jayalalithaa's demise, but the Karnataka government said in a review petition that the Supreme Court Jayalalithaa was alive till the completion of the trial, so this decision should apply to them as well and the court should seize her property and recover a fine of 100 crores

 Premium charges apply !! manonith pradhanmantri narendra modi ko pakistani netaaon ko biryani khilaanaa pasand nahin he or isliye raashtrapati bhawan ke khan-paan menu se biryani ko baahar kar diya gaya he
 The English newspaper The Times of India reported this
 akhbaar ke mutabik raashtrapati bhawan me pakistani pradhanmantri ko die jane vaale bhoj main biryani nahin rakhi gai he
 Modi is said to have called the Biryani diplomacy a conversation with Pakistanis during the UPA tenure and made fun of him
 chaaval or gosht se bani hui yah dish kaaphi popular he lekin is baar yah nahin parosa jayega jabaki kuch anya maansaahaari dish parose jaaenge
 Last week, Shashi Tharoor tweeted that if Nawaz Sharif accepts the invitation then we should expect Narendra Modi to feed him biryani
 ab raashtrapati pranav mukherjee ne modi ko us duvidha se mukt kar diya he
 His staff has not placed Biryani in the menu there
 uski bajaay anya chuninda dish rakhe gaye hai
 Modi had criticized the UPA government in March last year for feeding chicken biryani to Pakistani Prime Minister Raza Pervez while an Indian soldier was beheaded
 pichley saal unhone manmohan singh se kaha tha ki vah vah neuyork main navaj sharif se biryani par hone vaali baithak radd kar den

 maukey par pahunchin andiaref kii do tiimon ne raahat or bachaav kaa kaam shuru kar diya he
 The spot is 80 km from Pune city
 abhi tak kisi ke hataahat hone kii khabar nahin he
 Confirming the landslide, the Maharashtra Chief Minister's office said, "two teams of ambulances, JCB and NDRF have reached the spot
 mukhyamantri khud halaat par najar banaae hue hai
 'more than 100 relief workers of tow teams of NDRF have started their work
 birmingham main khele gaye shrunkhlaa ke chauthe van-de international match main mejabaan england ko haraate hi bhartiya team ke captain mahendra singh dhoni desh ke sabase kaamyaab van-de captain bhi ban gaye
 This was India's 91st ODI win under Dhoni's captaincy, while he has already achieved the title of the most successful Indian captain in Test matches and T20 International matches
 ab aankadon ke lihaaz se mahendra singh dhoni ne team india ke purv captain mohammad azahruddin ke record ko peeche chhod diya he, jinhone apni captaini main bhartiya team ko kul 90 maichon main jeet dilwaai thi
 Now Dhoni has topped all the captains of the world playing at present, but he is still number six in the list of all-time successful one-day captains
 australia ke diggaj riki ponting is suchi main sheersh par hai, jinhone 230 maichon main captaini kar 165 maichon main apni team ko jeet dilwaai
 He is followed by Alan Border of Australia, under whose captainship the Kangaroos won 107 matches, although Border played the responsibility of captaining the team in a total of 178 matches
 suchi main teesraa naam dakshin africa ke divangat captain hancy kronye kaa naam aata he, jinhone 138 maichon main captaini kii, or 99 maichon main apni team ko jitayaa
 At number four, New Zealand's Stephen Fleming is named, out of 218 matches played under his captaincy, the Kiwi team won 98 matches
 paanchaven sthaan par dakshin africa ke greem smith kaa naam he, jo 150 van-de international maichon main captain rahe, or unki team ko unamem se 92 main jeet hasil hui
 So, playing at the current pace and winning, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, popularly known as 'mr
 Cool', can soon be seen surpassing all other captains except Ricky Ponting, but Dhoni can relate his success to the team's success
 lets see
 unka kahana he, "jab mujhe captaini saunpi gai thi, tab vah ek shandaar team thi, or mere paas ab bhi ek shandaar team he
 
 
 i want to thank all of them, because of which it was possible
 
 
 " By the way, if a list of successful Indian captains is made, Dhoni has beaten former captain Mohammad Azharuddin by winning in Birmingham, who captained 174 one-day matches and won 90, while now Dhoni has 162 one-day matches
 Having won the responsibility of captaincy, he has won 91
 vaise, dhoni ne apni captaini main 57 match haare bhi hai, jabaki chaar match taai rahe or 10 maichon kaa parinaam nahin nikal sakaa
 In the list of successful captains, Dhoni and Azhar are followed by Sourav Ganguly, who won 76 of 146 matches as captain in his round
 unke baad rahul dravid hai, jo 79 van-de maichon main captain rahe, or 42 main jeet hasil kii, or suchi main paanchaven sthaan par bharat ke pehle vishwacap vijeta captain kapil dev hai, jinhone 74 maichon main captaini kar 39 main jeet hasil kii
 Well, if we look at the total, Mahendra Singh Dhoni has a lot of successes - he is India's most successful Test captain, winning the team in 22 matches
 vahi ab bharat ke sarvaadhik safal van-de captain bhi hai
 Dhoni is also India's most successful T20 captain, under whose captaincy Team India has won 26 matches
 dhoni ne hi varsh 2007 kaa tii-20 worldcup khitaab apni captaini main jitayaa tha, or unheen kii captaini main team india ne varsh 2011 kaa van-de worldcup khitaab jeeta tha
 This list of Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni's success is very long, but there are some successes written above which are the dream of any cricket captain and team in the world
 khaas baat yah he ki dhoni apni kamyaabi ko dohraane kaa fan jaanate hai
 He is different from everyone else, and his way of playing is different
 mahendra singh dhoni kehete hai, "main jo karata hum, vah karata hum
 
 
 i make plans, it goes, so fine
 
 
 nahin chal paati, to bhi koi baat nahin
 
 
 i stick to my plan
 
 
 kai baar aapako wicket mil jaati hai, kai baar nahin milti, lekin iskaa asar hota he, jiske bare main main or nahin bataanaa chahta
 
 
 " dhoni baar-baar yah ishaara bhi kar chuke hai ki varsh 2015 kaa worldcup unke liye ek bada mishan he, or agar team india ko agle saal phir varsh 2011 vaali kamyaabi hasil ho jaati he to bhartiya cricket main ek aisa itihaas likhaa ja sakegaa, jise cricket ke prashansak peedi-dar-peedi yaad rakhenge

 agyaat vastu girte hi logon ne police ko soochna diadhikari jaanane main jute- vastu giri kasevellore zile ke kevi kuppam ke naagarik somvaar raat ko hairaan rah gaye jab akaash se ek agyaat vastu aasmaan se unke pados main giri
 The citizens immediately informed the police

 After investigating the unknown object, it was said that this explosive was nothing else
 agyaat vastu main do elidi balb lage hue the jo girane ke baad bhi jal-bujh rahe the
 This was also a matter of concern for the local people

 It is a company that makes equipment for weather studies

 It is the lightest and smallest of the radiosondes available in the market

 They are known to measure temperature, humidity, wind pressure, wind direction and velocity accurately
 adhikari ab ye pataa lagane kii koshish kar rahe hai ki kis tarah ye vastu yaa upkaran is kshetra main akaash se giri
 It seems that no one likes retirement, only when it is announced that the age of retirement has been extended, one who does not grow also becomes happy
 duusari taraf college se nikalakar rojgaar samachar padhane waalon ko ye khabar nahin suhaati he
 They feel that if these three years do not retire now, their years of unemployment will increase
 jo naukari main ho uski bhi haalat berojgaar ke jaisi he ki chalo teen saal or mili
 The condition of one who is not in the job is like helpless
 pradhanmantri ne jab kaha ki ve kanoon banaakar sabhi doctoron kii umr 65 saal karne ja rahe hai
 There was a welcome about this news and somewhere there was a rumor that there was no attack on our stomach
 35 saal ke yuva 65 pratishat hai or agar ritairement kii umr 65 saal ho gai to kahin in 35 pratishat waalon ko 65 saal tak intazaar to nahin karnaa padegaa
 So we thought that in the pretext of checking how many years the doctors retire
 vaise to assi assi saal kii umr main doctor privet practice kar rahe hai or iske koi dikkat bhi nahin he magar sarkaar ne ab tak kya soch kar 60 yaa 62 kar rakhaa tha jiske kaaran 65 saal karne ko lekar itnaa ullas he
 Retirement at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) is 65 years old
 safadarajang medical college main alag-alag shrenee main doctoron kii ritairement umr 60, 62 or 65 hoti he
 Doctors retire in 65 years in government hospitals in Bihar
 upi ke sabhi medical college main doctor 65 saal main ritair hote hai
 Specialist doctors of government hospitals retire in 62 years
 gair specialist doctoron ko 60 saal main ritair hona padataa he
 The retirement age of doctors in Karnataka is 60 years
 odisha ke teen sarkari aspataalon main 65 saal he, baaki ke aspataalon main 62 saal he
 Doctors retire in Maharashtra in 64 years
 pradhanmantri ne thik hi kaha ki medikaal college main ritairement umr alag he
 Hospital is different
 kahin 65 saal he to kahin 60 se 62 he
 In many places there has been a demand for increasing the age
 20 janvari 2015 ko hindu akhbaar main ek report chhapi he ki tab manohar laal khatter ne haryana rajya ke sarkari karmchaariyon ke ritair hone kii umr 60 se ghataakar 58 kar di thi
 The Punjab and Haryana High Court accepted the verdict as correct
 mukhyamantri manohar laal khatter kii raay thi ki is faisle se yuvaaon ke liye rojgaar ke adhiktam avasar paidaa honge
 Those who opposed said that then why should IAS, college teachers and judicial officers retire in 60 years in Haryana, they should also become 58
 court main virdohi haar gaye
 There is another news on India Today site of 4 April 2016 that Haryana Government wants to increase their retirement age from 58 to 62 to overcome the shortage of doctors
 haryana ke swasthya mantri kaa bayaan tha ki aise prastaav par vichaar ho rahaa he
 Orissa also increased the retirement age from 60 to 65 years to meet the shortage of government doctors
 magar is prastaav ke khilaaf odisha medical sarvice association khulkar aa gaya
 Even wrote a letter to the Prime Minister
 ab pataa nahin ye association vaale kise patr likhenge kyonki pradhanmantri bhi 65 saal karne ja rahe hai
 There is a shortage of doctors in the proportion of patients in our country, but is this a shortage because there are no doctors at this time
 agar aisa he to aapako ek bhi doctor berojgaar nahin milanaa chahie
 Every year around 50,000 MBBS doctors in India come from 370 medical colleges in the country
 bharat duniya main sabase zyada doctor paidaa karne vaala desh he
 There are 18000 doctors every year in America, but their population cannot be compared to India
 kaaphi kam he
 Now we have to understand whether there is really a shortage of doctors in our country or in government hospitals, recruitment does not come out and those who get government jobs go to hospitals
 odisha ke sarkari aspataalon main kai baar doctor duty par jate hi nahin he
 In 2015, the Odisha government also issued a notice against 613 doctors
 odisha hi nahin ye kahani aapako desh ke tamaam rajyon ke sarkari aspataalon main milegi
 It also means a problem in the system of government hospitals
 lekin april 2015 kii times aaf india kii khabar he ki sarkaar gaanvon or mushkil ilaakon main kaam karne vaale doctoron ko vetan ke alaava 80,000 rupaya protsaahan raashi degi
 Even then the doctor is not ready for service in the villages
 30 janvari 2016 ke hindu akhbaar main afshaan yasmine kii report he ki karnataka public sarvice kamishan se niyukt ek general sarjan ne niyukti ke agle hi din istipha de diya
 a female doctor did not go to the hospital after joining
 afshaan ne likhaa he ki 1122 doctoron kii bahaali hui magar 597 hi duty par aae
 Whereas when the Public Service Commission comes out of the resumption of other posts, there are more applicants than seats
 sarkari aspataalon ke liye bahaali nikalati he to seat se kam aavedan aate hai
 Brought this few examples so that we know that we are taking a revolutionary decision by increasing our age or not having to take a revolutionary decision
 kya sarkarein bilkul prayaas nahin karti ki doctor nahin aae
 It does not seem so
 upi kii akhilesh sarkaar ne kaha he ki agar doctor gaanvon main jaaenge to post grajuation main admician ke vakt tees number alag se milenge
 Talking to doctors shows that working in government hospitals is a mess
 maahaul se lekar maukey tak kii tangi he
 They are not very excited by the decision to do 65 years
 ab ham yah jaananaa chaahate hai ki kya vaaki hamaare desh main kam doctor paidaa ho rahe hai
 One thing about the Prime Minister seems to be that doctors cannot be born in a day
 doctorl kii padhai kai saal kii hoti he lekin phir hamaare desh main post graduate kii seat itani kam kyon hon
 If 50,000 doctors do MBBS then why 25,577 seats are for post graduation
 maharashtra main radio therapy main piji karne ke liye sirf do seat he
 While the number of cancer patients is continuously increasing
 vigat varsh times of india ne likhaa he ki puure maharashtra main radio therapy ke ek hi professor hai
 Those who should have retired in 2007 at the age of 60 but Dr
 Kamble continued to teach at Nagpur Medical College till May 2015
 may 2015 main unki umr 65 ho gai
 The age of retirement in Maharashtra is 64 years
 is dauraan jab radio therapy kaa professor nahin mila, professor na hone se radio therapy kii donon siten chali jaatin lihaaza sarkaar ne yah prastaav taiyaar kiya ki jo contract par doctor rakhe jate hai unki umr 65 se badhaakar 70 kar di jaae
 This story tells that by increasing age we are covering the problem
 post graduate kii seat badhaai ja sakati he
 Till when there will be a post-graduate seat, where will the teacher be born, where will the doctor be born when there is no teacher
 tippaniyan Because there will be a teacher, there will be post graduate students only then the seat will also increase
 yah ek chakra he
 Governments can overcome this deficiency in one to two years if they wish
 ritairement umr kii jagah post grajuation kii seat badha detii to lagata ki iraadaa saaf he
 When OBC reservation was given in the nomination, within a few months the seats also increased and the class rooms were also built
 sarkari medical college main haalat yah he ki javaani guzar jaati he doctor faikalti nahin ban paata he
 So he gets frustrated and goes to private hospitals where the money position and alleged freedom are found
 privet aspataalon main azaadi kii unki daleel kuch nakli lagati he kuch asli bhi hoti he
 It is very important to have doctors, but are there solid surgeries to improve this system
 doctor kii kami nahin lagati, kahin gaanvon main nahin jane kaa bahaanaa to nahin, kya sarkaron ne ganvo main aspataalon main doctoron ke kaam karne kii suvidha behatar kiye hai, kya sarkari medical collejon main research kaa fund badhaayaa he, kya teaching kaa maahaul behatar hua he
 Is it not that 65 years have been done only to rob bravado, instead of lack of excuse
 privet sansthaanon main ritairement umr 70 saal he taaki 65 par doctor nikle to wo le jaaen
 When the Prime Minister said that he is going to make the age of 65 all doctors by making laws
 is khabar ko lekar kahin swaagat hua to kahin sugabugahat ki are kahin hamaare pet par prahaar to nahin he
 The 35-year-old youth is 65 percent and if the retirement age is 65 years, then these 35 percent will not have to wait for 65 years
 to hamane sochaa ki isi bahaane check kiya jaae ki doctor ritair kitne saal main hote hai
 Well, at the age of eighty eighty, the doctors are doing private practice and there is no problem for it, but what the government had till now thought it was 60 or 62, due to which there is so much enthusiasm for doing 65 years
 akhil bhartiya aryuvigyaan santhaan (ames) main ritairement kii umr 65 saal pehle se he
 The retirement age of doctors in Safdarjung Medical College is 60, 62 and 65 in different categories
 bihar main sarkari aspataalon main 65 saal main doctor ritair hote hai
 Doctors retire in 65 years in all medical colleges of UP
 sarkari aspataalon ke specialist doctor 62 saal main ritair hote hai
 Non-specialist doctors have to retire in 60 years
 karnataka main doctoron ke ritairement kii umr 60 saal he
 Three government hospitals in Odisha have 65 years, the remaining hospitals have 62 years
 maharashtra main 64 saal main doctor ritair hote hai
 The Prime Minister rightly said that the retirement age at Medikal College is different
 aspataal main alag he
 Somewhere is 65 years and somewhere 60 to 62
 kai jagahon par umr badhaane kii maang bhi hoti rahi he
 On 20 January 2015, a report appeared in the Hindu newspaper that then Manohar Lal Khattar had reduced the retirement age of Haryana state government employees from 60 to 58
 punjab or haryana hoicourt ne is faisle ko sahi mana tha
 Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar was of the opinion that this decision would create maximum employment opportunities for the youth
 virodh karne waalon kaa kahana tha ki phir haryana main iees, college ke teacher or nyaayik adhikari kyon 60 saal main ritair honge, ve bhi 58 main ho jaaen
 Opponents lost in court
 4 april 2016 ke india today kii site par ek or khabar he ki haryana sarkaar doctoron kii kami ko dur karne ke liye unke ritairement kii umr 58 se badhaakar 62 karnaa chaahati he
 The Haryana Health Minister said that such a proposal is under consideration
 urisa ne bhi sarkari doctoron kii kami ko puraa karne ke liye ritairement umr 60 se badha kar 65 saal kar diya tha
 But the Odisha Medical Services Association came out openly against this proposal
 yahaan tak ki pradhanmantri ko bhi patr likh diya
 Now it is not known to whom these associations will write letters because the Prime Minister is going to do 65 years
 hamaare desh main marizon ke anupaat main doctoron kii kami to he lekin kya ye kami isliye he ki is vakt doctor nahin hai
 If this is the case, you should not find a single doctor unemployed
 bharat main har saal kareeb 50,000 embibies doctor desh ke 370 medical college se nikalate hai
 India is the largest doctor producing country in the world
 america main har saal 18000 doctor nikalate hai magar unki aabaadi kii tulana bharat se nahin kii ja sakati
 Is quite low
 ab hamen samajhnaa ye he ki kya vaaki doctoron kii kami he hamaare desh main yaa sarkari aspataalon main bhartee hi nahin nikalati he or jinhen sarkari naukari milti he kya ve aspataalon main jate hai
 Many times doctors do not go on duty in government hospitals of Odisha
 2015 main odisha sarkaar ne 613 doctoron ke khilaaf notice bhi jari kiya tha
 Not only Odisha, you will find this story in government hospitals in all the states of the country
 iskaa matlab sarkari aspataalon ke tantra main bhi samasya he
 But the Times of India reported in April 2015 that the government would give an incentive of 80,000 rupees in addition to salary to doctors working in villages and difficult areas
 tab bhi doctor gaanvon main seva ke liye taiyaar nahin he
 Afshan Yasmin reports in the Hindu newspaper of 30 January 2016 that a general surgeon appointed from the Karnataka Public Service Commission resigned on the very next day of appointment
 ek mahila doctor jwine karne ke baad aspataal hi nahin gai
 Afshan has written that 1122 doctors were reinstated but only 597 came on duty
 jabaki public sarvice kamishan jab duusare padon kii bahaali nikalataa he to vahaan seat se zyada aavedak hote hai
 When the resettlement for government hospitals comes out, fewer applications come from seats
 ye chand udhaaharan bin kar isliye laayaa taaki pataa chale ki ham umr badha kar koi krantikari faisla le rahe hai yaa krantikari faisla na lenaa pade isliye umr badha rahe hai
 Do governments not try at all that doctors do not come
 aisa to nahin lagata
 The Akhilesh government of UP has said that if doctors go to the villages, then at the time of admission in post graduation, thirty numbers will be found separately
 doctoron se baat kar pataa chalata he ki sarkari aspataalon main kaam karnaa jhamela he
 There is a tightness from atmosphere to chance
 ve 65 saal karne ke faisle se bahut utsahit nahin hai
 Now we want to know whether fewer doctors are being born in our country
 pradhanmantri kii ek baat to thik lagati he ki ek din main to doctor paidaa nahin ho sakate
 Doctoral studies are of many years, but then why should the post graduate seats be so low in our country
 50,000 doctor agar embibies karte hai to 25,577 seat kyon hai post grajuation ke liye
 Maharashtra has just two seats to do PG in Radio Therapy
 jabaki cancer ke marizon kii sankhya lagaataar badhati ja rahi he
 Last year, the Times of India wrote that there is only one professor of radio therapy all over Maharashtra 
 jinhen 60 saal kii umr main 2007 main ritair ho janaa chahie tha lekin doctor kamble nagpur medical college main may 2015 tak padhaate rahe
 She turned 65 in May 2015
 maharashtra main ritairement kii umr 64 saal he
 During this time, when the professor of radio therapy was not found, the absence of a professor would lead to both seats of radio therapy, so the government prepared a proposal that the age of doctors who are hired on contract should be increased from 65 to 70
 yah kahani bataati he ki umr badhaakar ham samasya par pardaa daal rahe hai
 Post graduate seats can be increased
 jab tak post graduate seat nahin hogi to padhaane vaale teacher kahaan se paidaa honge, jab teacher hi nahin honge to doctor kahaan se paidaa honge
 The comments kyonki teacher hoga, post graduate chaatr honge tabhi to seat bhi badhegi
 This is a cycle
 sarkarein chahen to is kami ko ek do saal main dur kar sakati hai
 Had the post-graduation seat been increased instead of retirement age, the intention would have been clear
 jab namakan main obisi aarakshan diya gaya tha tab kuch hi maheenon ke bheetar siten bhi bad gayi or class room bhi ban gaye
 The condition in the government medical college is that the youth passes, the doctor is not able to become a faculty
 lihaaza wo hataash hokar privet aspataalon main chalaa jaataa he jahaan paisa pad or kathith rup se azaadi milti he
 His plea for freedom in private hospitals seems to be fake, some is real
 doctoron kaa hona bahut zaruri he lekin kya is vyavastha main sudhaar ke liye thos surgery ho rahi he
 There is no shortage of doctors, there is no excuse for not going to the villages, have the governments improved the facilities of doctors working in hospitals in the villages, has increased the funding of research in government medical colleges, has the teaching environment improved is
 kahin aisa to nahin ki kami ke kaaran kii jagah kami kaa bahaanaa banaakar 65 saal sirf vaahvahee luutane ke liye kii gai he
 Retirement age in private institutions is 70 years so that if doctors come out at 65, they take them
 akhil bhartiya aryuvigyaan santhaan (ames) main ritairement kii umr 65 saal pehle se he
 The retirement age of doctors in Safdarjung Medical College is 60, 62 and 65 in different categories
 bihar main sarkari aspataalon main 65 saal main doctor ritair hote hai
 Doctors retire in 65 years in all medical colleges of UP
 sarkari aspataalon ke specialist doctor 62 saal main ritair hote hai
 Non-specialist doctors have to retire in 60 years
 karnataka main doctoron ke ritairement kii umr 60 saal he
 Three government hospitals in Odisha have 65 years, the remaining hospitals have 62 years
 maharashtra main 64 saal main doctor ritair hote hai
 The Prime Minister rightly said that the retirement age at Medikal College is different
 aspataal main alag he
 Somewhere is 65 years and somewhere 60 to 62
 kai jagahon par umr badhaane kii maang bhi hoti rahi he
 On 20 January 2015, a report appeared in the Hindu newspaper that then Manohar Lal Khattar had reduced the retirement age of Haryana state government employees from 60 to 58
 punjab or haryana hoicourt ne is faisle ko sahi mana tha
 Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar was of the opinion that this decision would create maximum employment opportunities for the youth
 virodh karne waalon kaa kahana tha ki phir haryana main iees, college ke teacher or nyaayik adhikari kyon 60 saal main ritair honge, ve bhi 58 main ho jaaen
 Opponents lost in court
 4 april 2016 ke india today kii site par ek or khabar he ki haryana sarkaar doctoron kii kami ko dur karne ke liye unke ritairement kii umr 58 se badhaakar 62 karnaa chaahati he
 The Haryana Health Minister said that such a proposal is under consideration
 urisa ne bhi sarkari doctoron kii kami ko puraa karne ke liye ritairement umr 60 se badha kar 65 saal kar diya tha
 But the Odisha Medical Services Association came out openly against this proposal
 yahaan tak ki pradhanmantri ko bhi patr likh diya
 Now it is not known to whom these associations will write letters because the Prime Minister is going to do 65 years
 hamaare desh main marizon ke anupaat main doctoron kii kami to he lekin kya ye kami isliye he ki is vakt doctor nahin hai
 If this is the case, you should not find a single doctor unemployed
 bharat main har saal kareeb 50,000 embibies doctor desh ke 370 medical college se nikalate hai
 India is the largest doctor producing country in the world
 america main har saal 18000 doctor nikalate hai magar unki aabaadi kii tulana bharat se nahin kii ja sakati
 Is quite low
 ab hamen samajhnaa ye he ki kya vaaki doctoron kii kami he hamaare desh main yaa sarkari aspataalon main bhartee hi nahin nikalati he or jinhen sarkari naukari milti he kya ve aspataalon main jate hai
 Many times doctors do not go on duty in government hospitals of Odisha
 2015 main odisha sarkaar ne 613 doctoron ke khilaaf notice bhi jari kiya tha
 Not only Odisha, you will find this story in government hospitals in all the states of the country
 iskaa matlab sarkari aspataalon ke tantra main bhi samasya he
 But the Times of India reported in April 2015 that the government would give an incentive of 80,000 rupees in addition to salary to doctors working in villages and difficult areas
 tab bhi doctor gaanvon main seva ke liye taiyaar nahin he
 Afshan Yasmin reports in the Hindu newspaper of 30 January 2016 that a general surgeon appointed from the Karnataka Public Service Commission resigned on the very next day of appointment
 ek mahila doctor jwine karne ke baad aspataal hi nahin gai
 Afshan has written that 1122 doctors were reinstated but only 597 came on duty
 jabaki public sarvice kamishan jab duusare padon kii bahaali nikalataa he to vahaan seat se zyada aavedak hote hai
 When the resettlement for government hospitals comes out, fewer applications come from seats
 ye chand udhaaharan bin kar isliye laayaa taaki pataa chale ki ham umr badha kar koi krantikari faisla le rahe hai yaa krantikari faisla na lenaa pade isliye umr badha rahe hai
 Do governments not try at all that doctors do not come
 aisa to nahin lagata
 The Akhilesh government of UP has said that if doctors go to the villages, then at the time of admission in post graduation, thirty numbers will be found separately
 doctoron se baat kar pataa chalata he ki sarkari aspataalon main kaam karnaa jhamela he
 There is a tightness from atmosphere to chance
 ve 65 saal karne ke faisle se bahut utsahit nahin hai
 Now we want to know whether fewer doctors are being born in our country
 pradhanmantri kii ek baat to thik lagati he ki ek din main to doctor paidaa nahin ho sakate
 Doctoral studies are of many years, but then why should the post graduate seats be so low in our country
 50,000 doctor agar embibies karte hai to 25,577 seat kyon hai post grajuation ke liye
 Maharashtra has just two seats to do PG in Radio Therapy
 jabaki cancer ke marizon kii sankhya lagaataar badhati ja rahi he
 Last year, the Times of India wrote that there is only one professor of radio therapy all over Maharashtra
 jinhen 60 saal kii umr main 2007 main ritair ho janaa chahie tha lekin doctor kamble nagpur medical college main may 2015 tak padhaate rahe
 She turned 65 in May 2015
 maharashtra main ritairement kii umr 64 saal he
 During this time, when the professor of radio therapy was not found, the absence of a professor would lead to both seats of radio therapy, so the government prepared a proposal that the age of doctors who are hired on contract should be increased from 65 to 70
 yah kahani bataati he ki umr badhaakar ham samasya par pardaa daal rahe hai
 Post graduate seats can be increased
 jab tak post graduate seat nahin hogi to padhaane vaale teacher kahaan se paidaa honge, jab teacher hi nahin honge to doctor kahaan se paidaa honge
 The comments kyonki teacher hoga, post graduate chaatr honge tabhi to seat bhi badhegi
 This is a cycle
 sarkarein chahen to is kami ko ek do saal main dur kar sakati hai
 Had the post-graduation seat been increased instead of retirement age, the intention would have been clear
 jab namakan main obisi aarakshan diya gaya tha tab kuch hi maheenon ke bheetar siten bhi bad gayi or class room bhi ban gaye
 The condition in the government medical college is that the youth passes, the doctor is not able to become a faculty
 lihaaza wo hataash hokar privet aspataalon main chalaa jaataa he jahaan paisa pad or kathith rup se azaadi milti he
 His plea for freedom in private hospitals seems to be fake, some is real
 doctoron kaa hona bahut zaruri he lekin kya is vyavastha main sudhaar ke liye thos surgery ho rahi he
 There is no shortage of doctors, there is no excuse for not going to the villages, have the governments improved the facilities of doctors working in hospitals in the villages, has increased the funding of research in government medical colleges, has the teaching environment improved is
 kahin aisa to nahin ki kami ke kaaran kii jagah kami kaa bahaanaa banaakar 65 saal sirf vaahvahee luutane ke liye kii gai he
 Retirement age in private institutions is 70 years so that if doctors come out at 65, they take them
 pradhanmantri ne thik hi kaha ki medikaal college main ritairement umr alag he
 Hospital is different
 kahin 65 saal he to kahin 60 se 62 he
 In many places there has been a demand for increasing the age
 20 janvari 2015 ko hindu akhbaar main ek report chhapi he ki tab manohar laal khatter ne haryana rajya ke sarkari karmchaariyon ke ritair hone kii umr 60 se ghataakar 58 kar di thi
 The Punjab and Haryana High Court accepted the verdict as correct
 mukhyamantri manohar laal khatter kii raay thi ki is faisle se yuvaaon ke liye rojgaar ke adhiktam avasar paidaa honge
 Those who opposed said that then why should IAS, college teachers and judicial officers retire in 60 years in Haryana, they should also become 58
 court main virdohi haar gaye
 There is another news on India Today site of 4 April 2016 that Haryana Government wants to increase their retirement age from 58 to 62 to overcome the shortage of doctors
 haryana ke swasthya mantri kaa bayaan tha ki aise prastaav par vichaar ho rahaa he
 Orissa also increased the retirement age from 60 to 65 years to meet the shortage of government doctors
 magar is prastaav ke khilaaf odisha medical sarvice association khulkar aa gaya
 Even wrote a letter to the Prime Minister
 ab pataa nahin ye association vaale kise patr likhenge kyonki pradhanmantri bhi 65 saal karne ja rahe hai
 There is a shortage of doctors in the proportion of patients in our country, but is this a shortage because there are no doctors at this time
 agar aisa he to aapako ek bhi doctor berojgaar nahin milanaa chahie
 Every year around 50,000 MBBS doctors in India come from 370 medical colleges in the country
 bharat duniya main sabase zyada doctor paidaa karne vaala desh he
 There are 18000 doctors every year in America, but their population cannot be compared to India
 kaaphi kam he
 Now we have to understand whether there is really a shortage of doctors in our country or in government hospitals, recruitment does not come out and those who get government jobs go to hospitals
 odisha ke sarkari aspataalon main kai baar doctor duty par jate hi nahin he
 In 2015, the Odisha government also issued a notice against 613 doctors
 odisha hi nahin ye kahani aapako desh ke tamaam rajyon ke sarkari aspataalon main milegi
 It also means a problem in the system of government hospitals
 lekin april 2015 kii times aaf india kii khabar he ki sarkaar gaanvon or mushkil ilaakon main kaam karne vaale doctoron ko vetan ke alaava 80,000 rupaya protsaahan raashi degi
 Even then the doctor is not ready for service in the villages
 30 janvari 2016 ke hindu akhbaar main afshaan yasmine kii report he ki karnataka public sarvice kamishan se niyukt ek general sarjan ne niyukti ke agle hi din istipha de diya
 a female doctor did not go to the hospital after joining
 afshaan ne likhaa he ki 1122 doctoron kii bahaali hui magar 597 hi duty par aae
 Whereas when the Public Service Commission comes out of the resumption of other posts, there are more applicants than seats
 sarkari aspataalon ke liye bahaali nikalati he to seat se kam aavedan aate hai
 Brought this few examples so that we know that we are taking a revolutionary decision by increasing our age or not having to take a revolutionary decision
 kya sarkarein bilkul prayaas nahin karti ki doctor nahin aae
 It does not seem so
 upi kii akhilesh sarkaar ne kaha he ki agar doctor gaanvon main jaaenge to post grajuation main admician ke vakt tees number alag se milenge
 Talking to doctors shows that working in government hospitals is a mess
 maahaul se lekar maukey tak kii tangi he
 They are not very excited by the decision to do 65 years
 ab ham yah jaananaa chaahate hai ki kya vaaki hamaare desh main kam doctor paidaa ho rahe hai
 One thing about the Prime Minister seems to be that doctors cannot be born in a day
 doctorl kii padhai kai saal kii hoti he lekin phir hamaare desh main post graduate kii seat itani kam kyon hon
 If 50,000 doctors do MBBS then why 25,577 seats are for post graduation
 maharashtra main radio therapy main piji karne ke liye sirf do seat he
 While the number of cancer patients is continuously increasing
 vigat varsh times of india ne likhaa he ki puure maharashtra main radio therapy ke ek hi professor hai
 Those who should have retired in 2007 at the age of 60 but Dr
 Kamble continued to teach at Nagpur Medical College till May 2015
 may 2015 main unki umr 65 ho gai
 The age of retirement in Maharashtra is 64 years
 is dauraan jab radio therapy kaa professor nahin mila, professor na hone se radio therapy kii donon siten chali jaatin lihaaza sarkaar ne yah prastaav taiyaar kiya ki jo contract par doctor rakhe jate hai unki umr 65 se badhaakar 70 kar di jaae
 This story tells that by increasing age we are covering the problem
 post graduate kii seat badhaai ja sakati he
 Till when there will be a post-graduate seat, where will the teacher be born, where will the doctor be born when there is no teacher
 tippaniyan Because there will be a teacher, there will be post graduate students only then the seat will also increase
 yah ek chakra he
 Governments can overcome this deficiency in one to two years if they wish
 ritairement umr kii jagah post grajuation kii seat badha detii to lagata ki iraadaa saaf he
 When OBC reservation was given in the nomination, within a few months the seats also increased and the class rooms were also built
 sarkari medical college main haalat yah he ki javaani guzar jaati he doctor faikalti nahin ban paata he
 So he gets frustrated and goes to private hospitals where the money position and alleged freedom are found
 privet aspataalon main azaadi kii unki daleel kuch nakli lagati he kuch asli bhi hoti he
 It is very important to have doctors, but are there solid surgeries to improve this system
 doctor kii kami nahin lagati, kahin gaanvon main nahin jane kaa bahaanaa to nahin, kya sarkaron ne ganvo main aspataalon main doctoron ke kaam karne kii suvidha behatar kiye hai, kya sarkari medical collejon main research kaa fund badhaayaa he, kya teaching kaa maahaul behatar hua he
 Is it not that 65 years have been done only to rob bravado, instead of lack of excuse
 privet sansthaanon main ritairement umr 70 saal he taaki 65 par doctor nikle to wo le jaaen

 Retirement age in private institutions is 70 years so that if doctors come out at 65, they take them
 ye chand udhaaharan bin kar isliye laayaa taaki pataa chale ki ham umr badha kar koi krantikari faisla le rahe hai yaa krantikari faisla na lenaa pade isliye umr badha rahe hai
 Do governments not try at all that doctors do not come
 aisa to nahin lagata
 The Akhilesh government of UP has said that if doctors go to the villages, then at the time of admission in post graduation, thirty numbers will be found separately
 doctoron se baat kar pataa chalata he ki sarkari aspataalon main kaam karnaa jhamela he
 There is a tightness from atmosphere to chance
 ve 65 saal karne ke faisle se bahut utsahit nahin hai
 Now we want to know whether fewer doctors are being born in our country
 pradhanmantri kii ek baat to thik lagati he ki ek din main to doctor paidaa nahin ho sakate
 Doctoral studies are of many years, but then why should the post graduate seats be so low in our country
 50,000 doctor agar embibies karte hai to 25,577 seat kyon hai post grajuation ke liye
 Maharashtra has just two seats to do PG in Radio Therapy
 jabaki cancer ke marizon kii sankhya lagaataar badhati ja rahi he
 Last year, the Times of India wrote that there is only one professor of radio therapy all over Maharashtra
 jinhen 60 saal kii umr main 2007 main ritair ho janaa chahie tha lekin doctor kamble nagpur medical college main may 2015 tak padhaate rahe
 She turned 65 in May 2015
 maharashtra main ritairement kii umr 64 saal he
 During this time, when the professor of radio therapy was not found, the absence of a professor would lead to both seats of radio therapy, so the government prepared a proposal that the age of doctors who are hired on contract should be increased from 65 to 70
 yah kahani bataati he ki umr badhaakar ham samasya par pardaa daal rahe hai
 Post graduate seats can be increased
 jab tak post graduate seat nahin hogi to padhaane vaale teacher kahaan se paidaa honge, jab teacher hi nahin honge to doctor kahaan se paidaa honge
 The comments kyonki teacher hoga, post graduate chaatr honge tabhi to seat bhi badhegi
 This is a cycle
 sarkarein chahen to is kami ko ek do saal main dur kar sakati hai
 Had the post-graduation seat been increased instead of retirement age, the intention would have been clear
 jab namakan main obisi aarakshan diya gaya tha tab kuch hi maheenon ke bheetar siten bhi bad gayi or class room bhi ban gaye

 Retirement age in private institutions is 70 years so that if doctors come out at 65, they take them
 maharashtra main radio therapy main piji karne ke liye sirf do seat he
 While the number of cancer patients is continuously increasing
 vigat varsh times of india ne likhaa he ki puure maharashtra main radio therapy ke ek hi professor hai
 Those who should have retired in 2007 at the age of 60 but Dr
 Kamble continued to teach at Nagpur Medical College till May 2015
 may 2015 main unki umr 65 ho gai
 The age of retirement in Maharashtra is 64 years
 is dauraan jab radio therapy kaa professor nahin mila, professor na hone se radio therapy kii donon siten chali jaatin lihaaza sarkaar ne yah prastaav taiyaar kiya ki jo contract par doctor rakhe jate hai unki umr 65 se badhaakar 70 kar di jaae
 This story tells that by increasing age we are covering the problem
 post graduate kii seat badhaai ja sakati he
 Till when there will be a post-graduate seat, where will the teacher be born, where will the doctor be born when there is no teacher
 tippaniyan Because there will be a teacher, there will be post graduate students only then the seat will also increase
 yah ek chakra he
 Governments can overcome this deficiency in one to two years if they wish
 ritairement umr kii jagah post grajuation kii seat badha detii to lagata ki iraadaa saaf he
 When OBC reservation was given in the nomination, within a few months the seats also increased and the class rooms were also built
 sarkari medical college main haalat yah he ki javaani guzar jaati he doctor faikalti nahin ban paata he
 So he gets frustrated and goes to private hospitals where the money position and alleged freedom are found
 privet aspataalon main azaadi kii unki daleel kuch nakli lagati he kuch asli bhi hoti he
 It is very important to have doctors, but are there solid surgeries to improve this system
 doctor kii kami nahin lagati, kahin gaanvon main nahin jane kaa bahaanaa to nahin, kya sarkaron ne ganvo main aspataalon main doctoron ke kaam karne kii suvidha behatar kiye hai, kya sarkari medical collejon main research kaa fund badhaayaa he, kya teaching kaa maahaul behatar hua he
 Is it not that 65 years have been done only to rob bravado, instead of lack of excuse
 privet sansthaanon main ritairement umr 70 saal he taaki 65 par doctor nikle to wo le jaaen
 Because there will be a teacher, there will be post graduate students only then the seat will also increase

 The comments vishesh prakoshth ke disipi sanjeev kumaar yadav ne kaha, ‚Äòasipi veda prakaash kii nigaraanee main inspector brahmajit singh ke netritv main vishesh prakoshth ke ek dal ne tihaad jail se sanchalit ek phiroti giroh ke khilaaf chapa maaraa
 Seven people involved in the crime have been arrested
 ‚Äô Yadav said, 'they had conspired to recover Rs 50 lakh from a businessman in Bawana, Delhi
 ‚Äô Special Cell DCP Sanjeev Kumar Yadav said, "A team of Special Cell led by Inspector Brahmajit Singh, under the supervision of ACP Ved Prakash, raided a ransom gang operating from Tihar Jail
 aparaadh main shaamil saat logon ko giraftaar kar liya gaya he

 ' dilli hoicourt ne purna rajya kaa darj dilaane vaale aam aadmi party ke vaade par badi raahat di he
 The High Court has dismissed the petition filed to ban the advertisements of the Aam Aadmi Party
 chunavi mausam main lagaai gai is janhit yachika ko hycourt ne sunwaayee ke yogya na maanate hue khaarij kiya
 The Public Interest Litigation had said that the Aam Aadmi Party is trying to deceive the voters of Delhi in the Lok Sabha elections by saying that it will give full statehood
 ise aadhaar banaakar yachika main kaha gaya tha ki jhooth bolkar votaron ko lubhaane se jude party ke vigyapano ko roka jaae
 It was specially emphasized in the petition that even if the Aam Aadmi Party wins all the 7 seats of the Lok Sabha in Delhi, even in Parliament, it cannot get full statehood in Delhi
 lekin aam aadmi party purna rajya kaa darja dilaane ke naam par hi dilli ke votaron se loksabhaa chunaavon main vot maang rahi he
 This claim was completely misleading and false in the petition
 yachika main kaha gaya ki chunaavon se pehle votaron se vot hasil karne ke liye apane phaayde ke liye galat jaankaree kanoonee or naitik donon tarah se galat he
 In this petition, the court was asked to immediately stop all advertisements being published or broadcast on behalf of the Aam Aadmi Party from across the state
 lekin is maamle main buudhvaar ko dilli hoicourt main sunwaayee shuru hote hi court ne spasht kar diya ki vah is tarah kii yachikaaon ko naa to sunne yogya samajhate hai or naa hi kisi tarah ke dishanirdesh jari karnaa jaruri he
 The court was aware that in view of the elections in Delhi next week, such a PIL has been made, which appears to be less in public interest and more for political purposes
 yah yachika janpratinidhi act ke section 123 ke tahat lagaai gai thi jisamen kaha gaya tha dilli ko purna rajya kaa darja dilaane ke liye kisi bhi sarkaar kaa purna bahumat main hona jaruri he taaki loksabhaa or rajyasabha main bill paas karavaaya ja sake or aam aadmi party ke paas is tarah kaa koi bahumat nahin he
 This petition was filed on behalf of Saurabh Kansal and Surabhi Kansal in the Delhi High Court

 The court sentenced him to 22 months

 In Madhya Pradesh, Congress has been continuously attacking the BJP in the name of Shivraj through the expenditure on advertisements
 congress ne chunaav ayog se shikaayat kii he ki shivaraj ke naam or photo se prachaar agar ho rahaa he to kyon nahin uskaa kharchaa shivaraj ke nijee kharche main joda jaae
 'excuse me Maharaj, our leader Shivraj'
 
 
 inhen vigyapanon par philhal congress ko gussa aa rahaa he
 Congress Legal Cell President Ajay Gupta alleges that in these advertisements appearing daily in most of the newspapers of Madhya Pradesh, the face and name of Shivraj Singh Chauhan is clearly being paid, whereas he himself is a candidate
 aise main bijepi ke saath saath in vigyapanon se shivaraj kaa bhi prachaar ho rahaa he
 If the expenses of these advertisements which have been published since November 11, will be added, they will cross the electoral spending limit of Rs 28 lakh and hence the Congress has complained to the Election Commission and demanded a ban on the advertisement of Shivraj
 bijepi ne chunaav main ek baar phir shivaraj par bharosa jataayadarasal, madhyapradesh main lagaataar 15 saalon se satta main baithi bijepi ne chunaav main ek baar phir shivaraj par bharosa jataayaa he or isliye vigyapanon se lekar prachaar saamagree tak har jagah shivaraj singh chouhan kaa cheharaa dikh rahaa he
 When he spoke to the Chief Electoral Officer, v l Kanta Rao about this, he said that according to a circular of the Election Commission, if the candidate is also included in the party's star campaigner list, the expenses of the election campaign will not be added to his personal account
 haalanki unhone mana ki congress kii shikaayat kii jaanch kii jaaegi
 At the same time, BJP is enraged by the complaint made by the Congress
 bijepi pravaktaa rajnish agarwal ne congress se poocha ki rahul gandhi 2019 ke chunaav prachaar ke dauraan postaron se gaayab rahenge kya? kul milakar dekha jaae to is baar chunaav main vaise bhi jamini mudde ab tak gaayab hi rahe hai

 janata dal united (JDU) ne loksabhaa main naagarikta sanshodhan bill kaa samarthan kiya
 The outrage in JDU has come to the fore after the support of the Central Government on the Citizenship Amendment Bill 2019
 party ke upaadhyaksh or chunaav salaahkaar prashanth kishor ne apni hi party ke rashtriya adhyaksh or bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ke faisle par dukh vyakt kiya he
 Prashant Kishore expressed his displeasure on Twitter, saying, 'I am saddened by jdu's support on the Citizenship Amendment Bill
 yah bill dharm ke aadhaar par naagarikta pradaan karne vaala he jo bhedbhaav purna he'
 Disappointed to see JDU supporting # cabthat discriminates right of citizenship on the basis of religion
 It's incongruous with the party's constitution that carries the word secular thrice on the very first page and the leadership that is supposedly guided by Gandhian ideals
 - Prashant Kishor (@prashantkishor) December 9, 2019 Prashant Kishore further attacked his own party saying that jdu's support of the Citizenship Amendment bill does not match with the party's constitution, where the word secularism on the first page thrice Is written prashanth kishor ne ishaaron-ishaaron main nitish kumaar par aage bhi hamalaa bolaa or likhaa ki naagarikta sanshodhan bill par party kaa samarthan party ke netritv ke vichaardhaara se mail nahin khaataa he, jo ki mahatma gandhi ke vichaaron se prerit he
 Significantly, JDU was not in the mood to support the government earlier on the Citizenship Amendment Bill, but on Sunday the party took a U-turn on its decision and decided to support the government on this bill

 filmkaar fahd mustafa or dipti kakkad yaa ‚Äò‚Äòabhinayta‚Äô‚Äô loha singh or ritu maheshwari kaa naam sunakar aap chaunk jaaenge
 You can say that how are these people talking and who are talking, who are these people? How did we not hear his name? Do not be surprised, i had not even heard, until i was really shocked
 pichley hafte hamaare kai multiscreen haul main ek 80 minute kii dacumentary dikhaai gai
 However, he was shown at a time when not many people like to go to the hall
 phir bhi, samikshaon main use dhansu film bataaya gaya, lekin jab main dakshin dilli ke ek mal main ise dekhne gaya to darban ne mujhe bataaya ki thode se hi log tikat lekar haul main pahunche hai
 i 3 on Sunday evening
 45 baje jab ise dekhne pahunchaa to mahaj 15 log or the
 So in any sense this film could not garner discussion like Peepli Live
 ham yahaan fahd or dipti kii charchaa isliye kar rahe hai kyonki shaayad ve hamaare sabase rachanaatmak noujvaan logon main gine ja sakate hai
 He has made a very dramatic and eye-opening documentary contender on the organized business of power theft in our rotting stinky cities and this is perhaps the story of our most extinguished city of Kanpur
 phir ham iske mukhya paatro-loha singh or ritu maheshwari kii bhi charchaa isliye kar rahe hai kyonki ve asli jindagi main bhi vahi karte hai or film main bade saahas or eemaandaaree se ye bhoomikaayen nibhaai hai
 Loha Singh is short-bodied and his fingers have become somewhat crooked, perhaps by a flash of lightning
 ve shahar ke nami ‚Äò‚Äòkatiyaabaaz‚Äô‚Äô hai
 That is, through a "barb" they steal power from the connections of others
 jab saare upaay naakaam ho jate hai lekin bijli kii jarurat betahasha hoti he to log loha singh kii madad lete hai
 And they steal electricity from someone else's connection and give you their livelihood
 bonus yah he ki aapako us bijli kii keemat bhi nahin chukaani padati
 Maheshwari only tries to fight with this
 yah yuva iees adhikari kanpur bijli aapurti company (keiessio) kii mukhya kaaryakari adhikari hai
 This government company is worth Rs 2,000 crore
 se adhik ke bakaaye ke kaaran kai baar diwalia ho chuki he
 He is not able to buy electricity from the grid or spend on new transformers
 akasar garmi ke mausam main in transformaron main aag lag jaati he, jo sabhi shaharon main aam najaara hota he
 In such a situation, his work is impossible and he is not even expected to do it seriously
 phir bhi ve koshish karti hai or sthaneey samaajawaadee party ke vidhayak irfan solanki kii naaraazgi kaa shikaar hoti hai or 11 maah main hi unka tabadalaa ho jaataa he
 Such stories are common in Uttar Pradesh
 lekin main ghar pahunchaa or google par search karnaa shuru kiya to pataa chalaa ki ve asli paatr hai
 This 2003 batch IAS officer is a graduate from Punjab Engineering College, First Division and his UPSC profile shows that his transfers are frequent
 isliye jab ve muskaraate hue camere ke saamne bataati hai ki unke bachche sirf ek baar hi kisi skool main saal bhar kii padhai puri kar paae the to aapako fouran ehsaas ho jaataa he ki ve kya kah rahi hai
 We have seen the headlines of Ashok Khemka in Haryana and Durga Shakti Nagpal in Uttar Pradesh, but another IAS officer here is ready to take on the system
 dacumentary main bhi unhone aisi hi bhoomika ko anjaam diya he
 On the other hand, Loha Singh also looks equally adventurous with his abuses and appearances
 is film kii credit line main loha singh, ritu maheshwari or kanpur ke logon kaa zikr he
 Perhaps they can also add the names of all of us, urban Indians
 beshak, ham ek vikrut arth main ‚Äò‚Äòswatantraaa senaniyon‚Äô‚Äô ke desh ke log hai kyonki ham sabhi kuch anaaj se lekar rajmargon, pani se lekar bijli tak muft main chaahate hai, khaskar, agar vah sarkaar muhaiyaa kara rahi he
 This feeling is quite strong in our cities
 kisi bhartiya shahar main aap nagar nigam or iskar waalon ko to bhugtan karnaa chaahate hai lekin bijli waalon ko nahin
 In the case of electricity, you either like to bribe the inspector or seek the help of a "kantiabaaz"
 jab bijli kaa sara kaarobaar puraane sarkari vibhaagon se chalata tha to yah behad aasaan tha
 But after power reforms, in most states new companies have been created for production, transmission and distribution (usually called gencos, transcos and discoms) in most states
 ye ab bhi sarkari hai lekin inaki daren niamak tay karata he or unki balanceshit durust hona jaruri he
 If it is not so, the state has to pay it from its budget
 kuch bade shaharon-masalan, mumbai, ahmedabad, kolkata or dilli-main hi bijli kaa nijeekaran hua he
 Katiyabaaz shows this in a very effective way and shows what is really the truth of India's severe power crisis
 pichley kai varshon se main kai chunaavon main desh bhar main ghumta rahaa hum or har jagah, har aadmi kii sabase tikhi shikaayat bijli ko lekar hi he
 Governments promise more and more power stations and say that so many thousand MW power plants were set up in such a year
 koi yah nahin bataanaa chahta he ki beshak bijli kii kami he lekin itani bhi nahin ki hamaari jindagi main andhera chaa jaae
 The problem is that electricity production costs money and we, the people of India, are not willing to pay for it
 mere sahyogi india today (hindi) ke sampadak anshuman tiwari ne mujhe desh ke swa-aropit bijli sankat kii ascharyajanak asaliyat ko ujagar karne vaale kai tarah ke aankadon se rou-ba-rou karaayaa
 Central Electricity Authority (CEA) July 2014 report (http: / / goo
 glxjfddn)is bare main kuch dilachasp tathyon kii jaankaree detii he
 For example, would you believe that the total power shortage in the country in that month is just 3
 6 pratishat thi, jo vyastatam samay main 3
 Reached 9 percent? This decrease 5 in the north
 8 pratishat or pashchim tathaa purab main vyastatam samay main bhi kramshah mahaj 0
 9 and 1
 7 pratishat thi
 Then where did such a big crisis arise? The first reason for this is that we are not charged the right price of electricity, especially not from the farmers at all
 or jab hamen deni padati he to na dene ke tareeke nikaal lete hai
 As a result, most of the power companies of the state governments are in critical condition, some have gone bankrupt like KESCO
 unke paas bijli kharidne ke paise nahin hai, jinhen ab khulkar kaam karne yaa vitaran tantra ko apgrade karne kii jarurat he
 If the head of a company tries seriously to recover the arrears, it has to face the destiny of Maheshwari
 hamaara bijli sankat badtar isliye ho jaataa he ki sabsidi di jaati he or muft main bijli jalaane kii aadat pad chuki he
 Not only this, our governments have also failed to recover dues
 agar bijli vitaran aisa hi kharaab kaarobaar he to hamaari nijee companiyaan siiessi, bisies vagairah munafa kaise kama rahi hai?siie kii report main ek khaanaa tii and di ghate kaa he
 In Old English, it means transmission and distribution losses, but if you ask anyone in the power sector, he will immediately explain the meaning of it, theft and robbery losses
 yah report hamen 2010-11 or 2011-12 ke aankade muhaiyaa karaati he or usamen ghaataa kramshah 23
 97 percent and 23
 67 pratishat he
 This means that despite 15 years of power reforms, nearly one-fourth of the entire power generation and distribution is lost
 inamen zyaadaatar ham sabhi virgon ke naagarik chura lete hai
 We are incomparable people, we perform for electricity rates
 phir bhi ham apane gharon main khushi-khushi jensett laga lete hai or adhik mahange dijal se apni bijli banaate hai
 Remember how Arvind Kejriwal touched our hearts when he campaigned against electricity bills in Delhi
 sachai to yah he ki dilli main bijli kii sthiti pehle se kaaphi behatar hui he, tii and di ghaataa kaaphi kam he
 But companies are private
 isliye ve intjaam karti hai ki ham bhugtan karen
 But we, "freedom fighters" are not used to paying
 isi vajah se hamane kejariwal ko apana nayak mana jab ve paise na adaa karne se kate bijli conekshnon ko jodgaye ke liye apane iity ejineering ke hunar kaa istemaal kar rahe the
 This is why people in Kanpur, or elsewhere in the country, want to pay money to steal electricity, whether they call that technology "kantia" or "kundi" in other North Indian states
 uttar pradesh main to yah usee tarah mahamari kii tarah he jaise parikshaon main nakal karnaa
 Once again turn to the CEA report
 desh ke sabase bade rajya main vyastatam samay main bijli kii kami 23
 6 percent, which is 5 of the total shortfall in North India
 8 pratishat he
 The reason is that people do not pay
 ab aaie, do pramukh videshi vidwaanon pro
 "theft and Loss of Electricity in an Indian State" (http: / / goo) of Mary Golden (university of California and Printon University) and Bryan Min (university of Michigan) in January 2012
 gl / gbwh6s)naamak report ke hairatnaak aankadon par gaur karen

 bharat or pakistan ke bich jari tanaav ke bich mamata banerjee ne aatanki camp par bhartiya vayusena dwaara air strike (IAF Air Strike)par sawaal uthaae hai
 West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said on Thursday that the life of soldiers is more valuable than electoral politics, but the country has the right to know what exactly happened there after the air force air strike in Balakot, Pakistan
 
 bataa den ki 26 farvari ko bhartiya vayusena ne pakistan kii jameen par jaish ke aatanki camp par air strike kiya tha, jisamen kareeb 300 aatanki maar giraae gayi
 Citing reports from foreign media that there was no damage from Indian Air Force attacks on terrorist camps in Balakot, Mamta said, "the forces should be given an opportunity to come forward with the facts
 " mamata ne yahaan rajya sachivalay main samvaadadaataaon se kaha, "hawaii hamalon ke baad, hamen bataaya gaya ki 300 mautein huin, 350 mautein huin
 But i read reports in the New York Times and Washington Post that no human was killed
 ek anya videshi media report main keval ek vyakti ke ghayal hone kii baat kahi gai thi
 "he said," We have the right to know, the people of this country want to know how many were killed (in Balakot) where exactly the bomb was dropped? Did it fall to the target? "earlier, government officials said on Tuesday the IAF had destroyed and bombed large training camps of jaish-e-mohammed in Balakot in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan, including 350 militants, their instructors
 And the elder commander was killed
 darasal, 26 farvari ko pulavama aatanki hamale kaa badla lene ke liye bharat ne pakistani sarajameen par pal rahe jaish ke aatanki thikaanon par hamalaa bolaa
 The Indian Air Force had on Tuesday morning dropped bombs on jaish-e-mohammed's terrorist camp in Balakot, Pakistan and killed about 300 terrorists
 is dauraan bharat ne kareeb 12 miraj ladaaku vimaanon kaa istemaal kiya or 1000 kilo bamon kii barish kar di
 After this Pakistan's anger started coming out and it tried to reject the claim of India

 However, after Airstrike, India informed this to all countries
 VIDEO: teenon senaaon kii press conference : ham jo karnaa chaahate the wo kar diya The Modi government has decided to give 10 percent quota for the general class poor
 isse judaa bill loksabhaa main paas ho gaya he or rajyasabha main is par bahes jari he
 Meanwhile, an important question is being raised whether this law will survive in court? This question is because the Supreme Court has made it clear that the reservation cannot be more than 50 percent in any case whereas the reservation by the central government by reserving 10 percent seats for the poor students of general category gets up to 60 percent
 
 mangalvaar ko loksabhaa main is bill par bahes main hastkshep karte hue vitt mantri arun jetali ne is bare main sarkaar kaa tark samajhaayaa
 Jaitley said that the limit of 50 per cent imposed by the Supreme Court is only for caste based reservation
 iske peeche court kii bhaavana thi ki saamaanya varg ke liye kam se kam 50 fisadi siten to chodi jaaen varna ek varg ko ubaarane ke liye duusare varg ke saath bhedbhaav ho jayega
 According to Jaitley, the current bill is not against the spirit of the court's decision
 kyonki ye 10 fisadiarakshanusi saamaanya varg ko de rahaa he jiske hit ko dhyaan main rakhte hue 50 fisadi kii seemaa tay kii gai he
 According to this logic, the government hopes that its bill will pass the Supreme Court examination
 kya tha supreme court kaa nirnayaindira saahani cese main supreme court ne kaha tha ki kisi bhi surat main 50 fisadi se zyada aarakshan nahin ho saktaa kyonki ek taraf hamen merit kaa khyaal rakhana hoga to duusari taraf hamen saamaajik nyaay bhi dekhnaa hoga
 In this, a special thing was raised by Justice Jeevan Reddy that in some circumstances the government can cross the 50 percent limit
 virodhiyon kii daleelmodi sarkaar ke aarakshan bill ko saamaanya varg ke saath chhalaava maan rahe virodhiyon kaa tark he ki sarkarsupreme courtke faisle kii galat vyakhya kar rahi he
 The court had said to not allow more than 50 per cent reservation so that at least half of the seats are filled on merit basis
 agar saamaanya varg ke garibon ke liye 10 fisadi kaa kota tay kiya gaya to merit ke liye mahaj 40 fisadi siten rah jaaengi jo ki court ke faisle ke khilaaf hoga
 This is the reason why this bill will not survive in the Supreme Court

 ) Although there are only 7 Lok Sabha seats in the capital Delhi, there is a strange coincidence of these 7 seats with the chair of the country
 pichley 21 saal kaa chunavi itihaas ye bataata he ki in 7 siton ke dangal main jis bhi dal ne dilli waalon kaa dil jeet liya desh kii kursi use hi mili
 All the seven seats in Delhi will be voted together on May 12 in the sixth phase
 dilli main aam taur par muqabla congress or bijepi ke bich hi hota rahaa he lekin aam aadmi party ke maidan main hone se muqabla trikoniya he
 There are 7 Lok Sabha seats in the capital - New Delhi, North West Delhi, West Delhi, East Delhi, North West Delhi, Chandni Chowk and South Delhi
 2014 main in saaton siton par bijepi ko jeet hasil hui thi
 46 to BJP
 4% vot mili the
 While Congress 15
 1 or aam aadmi party ko 32
 Got 9% votes
 dilli se judaa desh kii kursi kaa aisa sanyog1951 main jab desh main pehla chunaav hua to dilli main loksabhaa kii 4 siten thim
 Seats increased to 7 in 1967
 lekin dilli kii siyasat main asli terning point 21 saal pehle 1998 main aayaa jab 7 main se 6 siten bijepi ne jiti
 Only one seat went to the Congress account
 dilli kaa ran jiti bijepi kii centre main bhi sarkaar bani or atal bihari vaajapeyi pradhanmantri bane
 Elections were held again in 1999 in the country
 13veen loksabhaa ke liye hue is chunaav main phir bijepi ne sabhi saaton siten jeet leen
 Atal Bihari Vajpayee was re-elected at the center
 iske baad 2004 ke chunaav main congress 6 seat jeetne main kaamyaab rahi or bijepi ke khate main sirf ek seat ai
 The center chair also underwent a change
 atal sarkaar kii jagah centre main dow
 The UPA government was formed under the leadership of Manmohan Singh
 2009 ke chunaav main dobaaraa congress ko safalataa haath lagi or sabhi 7 siten jeetne main vah kaamyaab rahi
 With this, the UPA-2 government was also formed at the center
 lekin 2014 main dilli ke matadaataaon ne apana janaadhar badla or sabhi saaton siten bijepi kii jholii main daal die
 In 2014, the political mood of Delhi changed, the country's chair also changed and the Narendra Modi government was formed at the center
 2019 kii siyaasi jang kaaphi rochakalambe samay se dilli main congress banaam bijepi kii jang hoti aa rahi thi
 But with the arrival of the Aam Aadmi Party, the contest has become triangular
 2014 main pehali baar aam aadmi party loksabhaa chunaav main utari thi lekin koi seat nahin jeet saki
 Although 32 to the Aam Aadmi Party
 9% vot jarur mili the
 In the 2015 Delhi Assembly elections, the Aam Aadmi Party won 67 out of 70 seats
 is baar party saaton siton par lard rahi he

 Do you think that some people in Pakistan do not want friendship with India and are trying to spoil every such attempt? Hina: There are people on both sides who do not want to let peace happen
 meraa maananaa he ki in kuch logon kii soch or propaganda ke hisaab se bahumat ko apni raay nahin deni chahie
 Supporters of radicalism lie in Pakistan, but you have mainstream political party and media houses involved in this kind of poisoning
 pakistan main chunaavon ke dauraan har kisi ko bharat se dosti kii baat kerani pad rahi thi
 But you do not want to give priority to this change
 pakistan kii mukhyadhara main badlaav aa chukaa he
 Then why don't you hand over Dawood Ibrahim? Hina: i don't know where Dawood is
 bharat or pakistan ke bich sansthaaen hai, jo is tarah ke muddon par act karti hai
 There are institutions that can solve these problems
 hamen media ke shor ke hisaab se chijen tay nahin kerani chahie
 We have been demanding from the beginning, giving evidence about Dawood

 You leave more

 When we leave the mountains empty, the people of your army, Mujahids come and sit there

 If i had control, people like Dawood and Hafiz would have risen from Pakistan

 Aman will be restored
 aapke videsh mantri banane ke baad kaisaa siyaasi maahaul rahaa?hina:maine is tarah kii baton ko koi tavajjo nahin di

 Being a woman there gives you more opportunities

 We made a woman speaker of the National Assembly
 aapke aalochak kehete hai ki nae kanoon ke tahat aapke pita graduate na hone ke chalate chunaav nahin lard paae or aapako unki jagah mil gai
 This cannot be done with others
 hina:main bilkul asahmati darj nahin karuungi

 aapke yahaan bhi hai aise parivaar

 ye sach he ki vah best kii nahin sabase kharaab halaat kii yaad dilaati hai
 But this reminder can inspire us for betterment
 bharat ke saath sambandhon ke mudde par sharif sarkaar ko aap kaise aankati hai?hina: tali donon haath se bajati he
 We have to improve the mutual environment
 jab tak aap dosti kii demand nahin paidaa karenge
 Will not create his need
 tab tak logon kii soch nahin badalegi
 You guys start a thought
 uske baad use pukhta karte hai
 There are also changes
 hamaare yahaan aman kii aashaa zyada mashhoor he
 
 
 Elections: We all have seen the election results in favor of BJP in the Hahliya assembly elections
 kya aapako lagata he ki agar aage chalakar is party ke narendra modi piem banate hai
 What will be the effect? hina: It would not be right to give a judgment call on this now
 abhi chunaav hone hai
 Long time
 agar desh main pakistan se dosti kii demand paidaa ho jaae
 So what is the problem? agar modi ye kah rahe hai ki manmohan ne pakistan ke maamle main chuudi pahan rakhi he
 And if Modi wins the election, then it shows the thinking of majority
 to phir vahi baat ho gai ki mukhyadhara kii soch badalani hogi
 Question of Karan Thapar, father of Kargil martyr Vijayant Thapar: Are some people committing evil deeds under the guise of non-state players

 War started from your side

 Told you to come to the conversation table
 non state players kii baat kii aapane, to ham sabase zyada ise jhel rahe hai
 Our soldiers, officers are dying
 ham ise saport nahin kar rahe
 Question of Nalin Mehta of Headlines Today: Indian films have been banned in Pakistan
 hina: dekhie court ne sirf itnaa kaha ki license kii prakriya puri hone tak nai filmein relies na kii jaaen
 Now it is being interpreted in such a way that Indian films were stopped
 Gaurav Sawant's question of Headlines Today: If the talks of the governments are not successful, should the forces of India and Pakistan talk to each other? Hina: India or Pakistan Why do i see military as a separate entity? ham sainik takhtapalat ko peeche chhod chuke hai
 The way the Ministry of External Affairs keeps in touch with each other
 usee tarah se sena ko bhi aapasi sampark main rahanaa chahie
 It has to be overcome that the Pakistani army does not want peace with India

 Senior JDU leader Sharad Yadav is likely to announce his next move on Thursday after Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar joined Lalu Prasad to quit BJP
 sutron ke mutabik sharad yadav ne baagi tevar tej kar liye hai
 On Thursday, he has organized a conference called 'save Shared Heritage' at Delhi's Constitution Club, in which all opposition leaders have been invited
 mana ja rahaa he ki sharad yadav guuruuvaar ko saansad ali anwar samet apane kuch samarthakon ko lekar ek gaiyr raajnneetik manch kaa elaan kar sakate hai, jiske jariye vah nitish kumaar ke khilaaf party ke bheetar kii jang jari rakhenge
 According to sources, Sharad Yadav has sharpened the rebel stance and on August 19, he and Ali Anwar will go to Patna where he will hold a 'jan Adalat Sammelan' at Sri Krishna Memorial Hall at 11 am
 nitish kumaar ke khilaaf bagawati tevar dikhaane ke baad sharad yadav ko janata dal united ne rajyasabha main apane sansadeey dal ke netaa ke pad se hataa diya tha
 Action was also taken against Rajya Sabha MP Ali Anwar, who had rebelled against Nitish Kumar
 bihar main sharad yadav ke kareebi 21 netaaon ko party se nikaal diya gaya, kyonki ve log sharad yadav kii yatra main shaamil hue the
 Among the leaders expelled from the party were former minister and Dalit leader Ramai Ram, who is believed to be from the Sharad Yadav camp
 guuruuvaar ko saajha viraasat bachaao sammelan ke liesharad yadavapuri ji jaan se jute hue hai taaki vah vipaksh ko ekajute karne vaale netaa ke taur par apni pahchaan bana saken
 For this, BR Ambedkar's great-grandson Prakash Ambedkar has also been called and Maharashtra's farmer leader Raju Shetty, whose organization was with the self-respecting charity organization NDA, is not doing well these days with the NDA
 sharad yadav ne isamen congress ke gulam nabi aaazaad ko bhi bulaayaa he or sipiem netaa seetaram yechuri ko bhi
 But there is still doubt about whether CPM will participate or not
 buudhvaar ko sharad yadav ne press conference karke kaha ki unhone vipaksh ke sabhi netaaon ko sajhi viraasat bachaav sammelan main bulaayaa he
 In his press conference on Wednesday, the special thing was that despite being asked many times, he did not speak anything against Nitish Kumar and just said that his conference is not against anyone but an attempt to save the common heritage of the country
 unhone kaha ki kisaanon kii aatmahatya rohit vemula jaise cond or una main daliton par hamalaa jaisi ghatnaon ne unhen is sammelan ko bulaane ke liye prerit kiya
 On Wednesday, JDU leader KC Tyagi said about Sharad Yadav's conference that if Sharad Yadav mobilizes people to save the common heritage of the country, then he will not have any problem
 lekin agar sharad yadav 27 agast ko patna main hone walelalu yadav kiraili main hissaa lete hai to jediu main unke liye koi jagah nahin rah jaaegi
 The special thing is that JDU is also going to have a party meeting in Patna on the 19th, in which JDU will be formally announced to join the NDA
 sharad yadav camp ke netaaon ne daawa kiya tha ki jediu ke 14 rajya ikaayiyon kaa samarthan unhen hasil he, lekin kasee tyaagi ne kaha ki jediu kii sirf paanch rajya ikaayiyon ko chunaav ayog main manyata praapt hai or unamem se chaar rajya ikaiyaan nitish kumaar ke saath hai
 However, when asked about Sharad Yadav's removal from the party, KC Tyagi once again said that Sharad Yadav is a senior JDU leader and we do not want the party to take any action against him
 lekin iske liye unhen lalu yadav jaise bhrasht netaa se sambandh todna hi hoga

 Meanwhile, amid all these claims of the IS, a report of the Ministry of Home Affairs has also come out, which says that so far a total of six Indian youth have been killed fighting on behalf of IS, while 20 are still fighting

 Intelligence reports of the Indian Army also show that in the last one year, more than 80 youth from the Kashmir Valley have crossed the border

 In order to reduce the death of Arab terrorists, the impact of ISIS among the Indian youth may be increasing, but these youths associated with IS from India, Bangladesh and Pakistan have no place there

 Now that Bangladesh is a neighboring country of India, the question arises whether ISIS has reached India any closer to Bangladesh by the way of Bangladesh?
