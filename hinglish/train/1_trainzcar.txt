 The Sangh has given clarification on the controversy over the statement of Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat about the army
 RSS ke prachaar pramukh manmohan vaidya ne kaha ki rahul gandhi anaavashyak raajnneeti kar rahe hai
 Mohan Bhagwat has not done any army volunteer

 Rather, it is said to prepare an additional army of civilians to stand and fight with the army
 unhone kaha ki nagarikon main se sena ko taiyaar karne main 6 maheene kaa samay lag saktaa he
 He said that there is a discipline in the rituals that volunteers do
 isliye swayamsevakon main se sena ko taiyaar hone main 3 din lagate hai

 The RSS Chief's speech is an insult to every Indian, because it disrespects those who have died for our nation
 It is an insult to our flag because it insults every soldier who ever saluted it

 iske baad agle chaar saal main jo hua, usne sabhi kii dharna badal di
 Dhoni, who made his domestic debut through the 1998–99 season with the Bihar cricket team, was selected in the india-a team for the 2004 tour of Kenya
 srilanka ke khilaaf do april 2011 ko vishwa cap final main itihaas rachane vaale bhartiya cricket ke do daidipyaman sitare dhoni or yuvaraj singh kaa saamana pehali baar 1999-2000 kooch behaar trophy main hua tha
 Dhoni scored 488 runs in 12 innings of that tournament, took 17 catches and struck out seven stumps
 chaar saal baad unhen 23 disambar 2004 ko bangladesh ke khilaaf chatgaanv main pehla vanade khilne kaa mauka mila lekin vah pehali gend par ran out ho gaye
 In the first four matches he could not do anything amazing but the fifth match played against Pakistan in Visakhapatnam changed everything
 dhoni ne 123 gendon main 148 ran banaae
 This year, he scored an unbeaten 183 against Sri Lanka
 vanade cricket main behtareen pradarshan ne unhen test team main jagah dilaai
 He reached the top of the ICC ODI rankings at the end of the 2005–06 season
 vishwa cap 2007 main team ke pehle daur se baahar hone ke baad dhoni bangladesh ke khilaaf shrinkhalaa main main of da series rahe
 He was then named vice-captain for the tour of England
 sitambar 2007 main pehle tii20 vishwa cap main unhen bhartiya team kaa captain chunaa gaya or iske saath hi bhartiya cricket ko ek aisa agua mila jo kathin halaat main dhary nahin khota or haari hui baaji jeetne kaa fan bakhubi jaanata he
 India won the title by defeating arch-rivals Pakistan in the first T20 World Cup in South Africa
 iske baad austrailia ke khilaaf sitambar 2007 main saat maichon kii vanade shrinkhalaa ke liye bhi dhoni ko captain banaaya gaya
 He also became the captain of the Test team through the fourth and final Test played against Australia in Nagpur in November 2008
 tisare test main ghayal hue anil kumble ne sanyas kii ghoshnaa kar di or dhoni ko unka vaaris chunaa gaya
 Under Dhoni's captaincy, India topped the ICC Test rankings in December 2009
 dhoni 2009 main lambey samay tak isisi vanade ballebaaji ranking main sheersh par rahe
 That year he scored 1198 runs in 24 innings at an average of 70
 vishwa cricket main us saal utane ran sirf riki ponting ne banaaye the lekin unhone 30 pariyon main yah kamaal kiya
 Another gift from Captain Cool Dhoni won the title in the 2011 World Cup
 bharat 28 saal se jis pal kaa intjaar kar rahaa tha, vah dhoni ke balle se lage chakke ke saath aayaa
 Chasing a target of 275 against Sri Lanka, Dhoni came to bat ahead of in-form Yuvraj Singh and scored an unbeaten 91-run knock off 79 balls
 riti sports management and mindscap ke saath july 2010 main teen saal ke liye 210 karod rupaye kaa qaraar karne vaale dhoni kii kahani kisi pariktha se kam nahin lagati
 Dhoni, who was a ticket collector at one time, was included in Time magazine's most effective 100 people of 2011
 samay badal gaya, nahin badla to kabhi haar nahin maanane kaa jajba jo dhoni ko sabase alag jamaat main khadaa karata he

 According to espncricinfo, he will not be able to play in Friends Life T20 due to a contract with BCCI, but will be available once the county championship resumes
 tippaniyan Although Harbhajan has not played a Test match for some time since his injury early in the Ranji season, he played for Punjab in the National one-day Championship and also led the Mumbai Indians in the Indian Premier League
 asex ke saath yah qaraar unhen phir se cricket main vaapasi karaayega

 The comments haalanki harbhajan ne ranjai satr ke shuru main chot lagane ke baad kuch samay se test match nahin khele hai, lekin vah rashtriya van-de championships main punjab kii ore se khele the or unhone indian premier lig main bhi mumbai indians kii aguwai kii thi
 This deal with Essex will bring him back to cricket

 He took 57 wickets at an average of 10
 county cricket main acha pradarshan unhen rashtriya team main apana sthaan hasil karne kaa mauka degaa, kyonki aar aswin kaa pradarshan bhi acha nahin rahaa he

 film: jai ho demokresidiarector: bikramjit singh bhullar or ranjit kapoorstar cast: om puri, annu kapur, seemaa biswas, satish kowshik, adil hossain, grusha kapur, aamir bashir, benjamin gilaniavadhi: 96 minutesrtificate: u / aretimga:1
 5 Star India has made many films regarding Pakistan's relations, war and borders
 adhikansh filmein gambhir kism kii hoti hai lekin is baar sarhad ke saath saath hamaare mantriyon or niyam kanoono ke upar ek vyangy karne kii koshish kii gai he
 Now whether this satire is successful or failed, let's find out
 kahanibharat pakistan ke border par ghat jaati he ek bevakoofi bhari ghatana
 This incident is the film, and because of that the news channels start running the news
 mantriyon ke kaan tak ye baat pahunchati he or phir ek samiti kaa gathan kiya jaataa he jo samvidhan ke niyamon ke hisaab se is vishay par nishkarsh nikaalane kii koshish karti he
 Now can these ministers find a solution to this absurd problem of the soldiers during the meeting? The filmmaker has tried to demonstrate this
 mantriyon kii cameti main kripashankar pandeya (om puri),ramlingam (annu kapur),harphul singh choudhary (satish kowshik),mohini devi (seemaa biswas),major barua (adil hossain),misses bedi (rajani gujral) hai
 In the beginning of the film, Abraham Lincoln, Mahatma Gandhi's statements related to democracy were thought to be a very interesting story
 jis pal sarhad kii bevakoofi bhari ghatana hoti he to bhi lagata he kii manoranjan se bhari hogi ye film
 However as the film progresses, the story begins to loosen
 ek hi vakt par mantriyon kaa kisi bhi baat par hansaane kii koshish karnaa, to duusari taraf news ko bade hi tarkahin tareeke se dikhaaya janaa jhunjhalaahat paidaa karata he
 Eventually the film fills you with boredom
 96 minute kii film badi lagane lagati he
 'anything' is shown in the form of satire along with noise
 film ke kirdaaron kii agar baat karen to kamjor kahani kii vajah se koi charitra achche se ubhar nahin paata
 You will not mind the wasteful expenditure of brilliant artists like Annu Kapoor, Adil Hussain, Satish Kaushik, Om Puri, Seema Biswas
 vyangy ke naam par bas netaaon kii ladaai, apshabdon kaa prayog karnaa, sansad main ashleel filmein dekhnaa, or kisi bhi baat kaa mudda bananaa bhi dikhaaya gaya he
 The subject of border problems disappears in the meeting of ministers
 samvaad kahin kahin aapako hansaate hai jaise, 'faujee kaa sabase bada sapana he chhuti par janaa'
 a question has also been asked by the film that 'why don't politicians send their children to the army?' Why see: If you are a fan of Anu Kapoor, Om Puri, Adil Hussain or Satish Kaushik, then only see money and time Can work on some other work
 kyon na dekhen: iske liye aapako paryaapt kaaran die ja chuke hai

 🌈❤️🙌🏻💪🏻 我對於大家的支持和愛感到十分驚喜與感激。你們在我和我女朋友 @andiautumn 的instagram户口留下的正能量實在令我感恩。多謝來自世界各地的你們給我的祝福,令我感到恩惠,當香港傳媒不斷去評論我的生活時,令我感受到無比的壓力。我從小在一個佈滿負面和封閉的環境下長大,但是隨著社會進步,我希望能夠利用我的故事來説出真相從而幫助其他和我處境一樣的人。我曾經對於世界和未來感到非常無助和迷惘,但慶幸身邊一直有不同的人去支持和鼓勵我,令我想通了,成長了。最後我想再次多謝大家的關懷和接受。🌈❤️🙌🏻🦄 # lgbt # androgynous # lgbtqai # loveislove # lovewins # lovealwayswins # lesbian # love # support # 🌈 # androgynous # queer # gay # gaygram # loveyourself # advocacya post shared by @stolenmilktea onoct 6, 2017 at 10:44am pdtemdi ne kya likhaa ?endi ne is bare main likhaa, 'hamen apane parivaar, samaaj or doston kaa kaaphi virodh jhelana padaa, lekin ye sab mere liye koi myne nahin rakhata

 offis main aise karmchaariyon se aksar saamana hota he jo mizaaj se behad akkhad hote hai
 So know how to deal with them without spoiling the office environment: 1
 sahakarmi ke vyavhaar se aahat na hon kyonki uskaa vyavhaar mahaj aapke saath hi aisa nahin he
 Rude behavior can also be your partner's habit
 or sambhav he ki use iskaa ilm bhi na ho
 2
 apana niyantran banaae rakhen
 Forcibly trying to resolve the case will also be of little use
 agar zyada gussa he to vahaan se chale jaaen, bahes nahin karen
 3
 samajhane kii koshish karen ki us shaks kaa vyavhaar hi aisa he yaa aap zyada samvedansheel hai
 Talk to your other colleagues and try to understand them
 4
 Calmly explain to your colleague and tell them that this is not the right way to talk
 baat karte vakt sanyam rakhen or gussa karne se bachein
 5
 agar vah sahakarmi khud kaa bachaav karte hue dusron par aarope lagaataa he to use bataaie ki isse fark nahin padataa ki koun kya kahata yaa karata he ? use apane vyavhaar main badlaav laana hoga
 6
 samasya zyada bad jane par apane bos yaa management se baat karen
 Put three to four examples in front of them
 halaat agar phir bhi nahin sudhare to yaa to use nazarandaaj karnaa sikh len
 If this is affecting your work to a great extent, then change the team

 The search operation is going on at the Dera Sacha Sauda Ashram of Gurmeet Ram Rahim in Sirsa and it is feared that many bodies are buried in the camp
 is bich dushkarmi baba ke nae kukarm lagaataar saamne aate ja rahe hai
 In this episode, the deal of corpses has been revealed from the camp
 is nae khulaase kii vistrut jaanch hogi to pataa chalegaa ki kaise baba ashram kii aad main laashon kaa saudagar bana baitha tha
 The place where Baba has built ashrams, where big markets, malls, cinema halls, resorts are being built, through such a place, such a story of corpses is being filtered, which is pointing to Baba's corpse being a merchant
 dere main jameen ke andar nar kankalon kii mistry se pardaa uthegaa to baba ke gunahon kii fehrist lambii chaudee hoti jaaegi
 On the second day of the raid in the ashram, the news of the deal of corpses has stirred up on Saturday
 pataa chalaa he ki sirsa ke isi ashram se 14 laashen lakhanu ke ek privet medical college ko bheji gai thim
 Since when did this game of corpses deal with Baba's religious world? What is the secret of those 14 dead bodies? Many such questions have to be answered
 lekin is khulaase ke baad siyaasi halake main bhi hadakamp much gaya he
 The Haryana government has set up an investigation to find out the truth
 swasthya mantri anil vij ne laashon ke kathith saude kii jaanch ke liye aadesh de die hai
 Haryana Director General of Health Satish Aggarwal will report on the deal of the dead bodies
 sirsa ke ashram main shuukravaar se talaashi chal rahi he
 There is also an angle in the theory of the investigating agencies about the missing people who used to come to Baba's ashram to listen to satsangs, but did not return to their homes till date
 jaankaree aisi bhi he ki deraa main aane vaale tamaam shraddhaluon se baba baqayada affidavit likhvata tha
 In this affidavit it was written that after his death, the dead body would not belong to his family but to the dera
 aise main 14 laashon ko lakhanu ke medical college bheje jane par shaq-shubahaa kii jaden gahari hoti ja rahi hai
 Investigative agencies also suspect that male skeletons were also used to deal with Baba cadres
 haalanki is angel par police gambhirtha se tathyon or sabooton ko khangaal rahi he
 During the search operation on Saturday, several factories of Baba were raided
 police ne baqayada isaki video recording karaayi he
 Earlier on Friday, during the search operation, these items found from the camp - the search team has received 1200 new notes, 7000 old notes, whose total value will not be more than a few thousand
 - plastic kii karency mili he jiskaa istemaal deraa ke andar hone vaali saamaanon kii kharid-farokht main hota tha
 - OV Bain used in television broadcasting
 - bina number vaali kaale rang kii lexs lagjri car mili he
 - Computer, laptop, hard disk have been found, from which some clues can be found
 - baari maatra main bina level vaali davaaiyaan bhi mili hai
 They may be used to trick supporters
 - deraa sachcha ke do kamaron ko search team ne sil kar diya he
 - 5 people including 2 minors were found from the camp
 abhi to ye shuruyaat he
 Many chapters of Ram Rahim's iniquity will open further
 lekin bada sawaal he ki ye search abhiyaan 15 din baad shuru hua he
 Eyewitnesses are saying that Baba has sent the evidence of crime in the trucks out of the camp
 - shuukravaar kii subah saadhe 10 baje ke kareeb search team deraa sachcha sauda ke bheetar daakhil ho gai
 - For the first time, the search team also entered Gurmeet Singh's mysterious cave which has many stories about it
 - search team ne ram rahim ke dhyaan centre kii bhi talaashi lee
 - Search team has also found many evidences from the investigation of the printing press, guest house, MCG Mart inside the dera

 kaadir ne kaha, imran khan ne kaha he ki khilaadi ko shikhar par pahunchakar sanyas le lenaa chahie, jo galat nahin he
 But Sachin is a special player and his status is very high
 vah bharat hi nahin, balki vishwa cricket ke kohinoor he or unhen khud faisla lene kii sahuuliyat honi chahie ki unhen kab tak khelnaa he
 Kadir, who made his debut in Karachi in 1989, bowled in the first match, said, "sachin has given a lot to cricket
 kudarat ne unhen khaas hunar se nawaja he or aisa khilaadi ek yug main ek hi hota he
 He is also native and the day he feels that he is unable to give anything to Indian cricket, he will say goodbye to the game himself

 Former Pakistan chief selector Qadir said, "I have played international cricket for 18 years and i can understand the pressure of a good performance
" ek yaa do match yaa ek shrunkhlaa main kharaab pradarshan ke baad is tarah kaa dabaav banaaya janaa saraasar galat he
 No one can score a century in every match
 pakistan ke liye 67 test main 236 or 104 van-de main 132 wicket le chuke is leg spinner ne kaha ki pehle match se hi unhen anumaan ho gaya tha ki sachin kuch khaas hai
 "the dangerous outswing of a fast bowler like Waqar Younis in 1989 in Karachi, 16-year-old Sachin drove his leg forward and drove
 aisi gend par koi manza hua ballebaaj bhi aage badhkar khilne ke bare main sau baar sochega
 i knew then that this boy is something special
 tippaniyan On the same tour, Tendulkar scored 53 off 18 balls in a exhibition T20 match in Peshawar, including Qadir's 27 runs in one over

 After that Sachin hit my first, second and fourth ball for six
 agle over main mushtak ahamed ko chaar chakke lagaae
 He said, it was a new era in the history of cricket
 iskaa mahanayake sachin tha, jisaki chamak aaj bhi kam nahin hui he
 He has given so many beautiful memories to cricket lovers, he should also have the right to leave the game on his own free will

 Qadir said, Imran Khan has said that the player should retire after reaching the summit, which is not wrong
 lekin sachin ek khaas khilaadi hai or unka darja bahut ooncha he
 He is not only the Indian but also the Kohinoor of world cricket and they should have the flexibility to decide for themselves how long they want to play

 He said, i would like to say this much to those who criticize Sachin, look at his achievements, his record in the last 20 years
 pakistan ke purv mukhya chayankarta kaadir ne kaha, maine 18 saal antarrashtriya cricket kheli he or main achche pradarshan kaa dabaav samaj saktaa hum
 It is utterly wrong to create such pressure after a poor performance in one or two matches or a series
 har match main koi shatak nahin jamaa saktaa
 The leg-spinner, who has taken 236 in 67 Tests for Pakistan and 132 wickets in 104 odis, said that from the very first match, he had guessed that Sachin is something special
 unhone kaha, karachi main 1989 main vakaar younus jaise tej gendbaaj kii khatarnaak outswing par 16 saal ke sachin ne pair aage nikaalkar drive lagaaya
 Any intended batsman on such a ball will also think about playing a hundred times going forward

 pradhanmantri maujuuda general or cabinet ke mantriyon se salaah-mashvira karne ke baad ummidavaaron kii list main se agle army chif kaa naam chunate hai
 The recommendation of this name is sent to the President, which is formally stamped
 nayaa army chif usee din pad sambhalata he, jis din nivartmaan chif ritair hote hai
 Nawaz Sharif, who does not open the cards till the last moment, has his own style of choosing the army chief of the political journey of three decades
 teesri baar pakistan ke piem bane navaj kaa anubhav sena pramukhon ko lekar anubhav rahaa he
 It is said that he does not open the cards till the last moment, who will be the next army chief
 general jiya se lekar general sharif tak 15 alag-alag sena pramukhon main se aath ke saath sharif kaam kar chuke hai
 Of these, General Pervez Musharraf, General Ziauddin Khwaja and General Rahil Sharif were appointed directly on behalf of Nawaz
 haalanki general khwaja ko baad main army se barkhaast kar diya gaya tha
 Nawaz Sharif's role in appointing General Office Nawaz and General Abdul Waheed Kakar was limited as President Ishaq Khan was powerful at the time
 29 november 2013 ko navaj sharif ne hi raahil sharif ko15waan army chif niyuktakiya tha
 At that time, two senior officers were ignored and Rahil Sharif was made the chief of the army
 aamtaur par pakistan main sena pramukh teen saal ke liye niyukt hote hai
 If the President wishes, he can extend the service to the Army Chief on the advice of the Prime Minister
 seva vistaar par bhi raashtrapati kii aupchaarik manjuuri jaruri hoti he
 General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, who was Army Chief before Rahil, held this post for six consecutive years
 army chif ke ritair hone kii prakiya bhi choti nahin he
 After the retirement date is set, the army chief goes on a 'farewell tour'
 is dauraan wo deshbhar kaa daura karte hai or sena ke afasaron va javaanon se milte hai
 Farewell tour of Rahil Sharif has also started
 general sharif ke vidaai daure kii shuruyaat lahore se hui jahaan somvaar ko unhone army or rangers ke afasaron or javaanon ko sambodhit kiya
 Sharif then went to Gujranwala where he addressed the officers and jawans of Mangla and Gujranwala Corps
 general sharif jald hi karachi or peshawar bhi jaaenge
 However, General Sharif's tenure as Army Chief has been brilliant
 june 2014 main taharik-e-taliban ke khilaaf uttari wajiristaan main oparation jarb-e-ajb kii shuruyaat general sharif ke kaarykaal kaa golden period rahaa
 General Sharif is also given credit for wiping out terrorism in Karachi and restoring peace in the city
 sharif 'abisi news point' kii taraf se saal 2015 ke liye duniya ke sarvshereshth military commander ke sammaan se navaaje gaye
 But looking at the kind of situation that has arisen on the border for the last few days, it seems that if the old Army Chief farewell and the appointment of the new Army Chief is done peacefully, then it will prove to be a milestone in Pakistan's democracy

 15 agast ko ladakh main sthit pengong jhil ke kareeb donon deshon kii senaaon main takaraav hua
 In the midst of these ever-increasing confrontations with China, many questions have arisen regarding the security of borders before India
 sawaal he ki kya ab china ke saath vaastavik niyantran rekha (LAC) bhi pakistan ke saath pashchimi seemaa (loc) kii tarah ho jaaegi? kya vahaan nirantar nigaraanee or satark chetavanee kii aavashyaktaa he?ladakh main elesi par sardiyon main taapmaana -30 degree celsius tak gir jaataa he
 However, no post has ever been vacant
 kuch jagahon par atyadhik sardi kii sthiti main javaanon kii sankhya main kami hoti he
 But now it can change
 ab tainaati kaa str garmiyon ke maheenon ke tarah hi zyada rahegaa
 According to sources, the frequency of LAC patrol may also increase
 seemaa ke saath lagbhag 60 gasht point he
 The number of such patrol points may increase further throughout the year

 But given that some vulnerable areas are difficult to reach, India has no choice but to strengthen the deployment

 The decline in the number of encounters of the two armies last year is now increasing
 is july tak lagbhag 300 baar ghuspaith kii koshish hui, jabaki pichley saal ye sankhya keval 200 hi thi
 It is expected to cross 500 by the end of the year
 donon taraf se hui patharbaji15 agast ko pengong jhil main ghuspaith ki koshish main naakaam hote dekh chini sainikon ne patharbaji shuru kar di
 There are reports of mild injuries to the soldiers on both sides due to stone pelting

 When the Chinese soldiers saw that their attempt had failed, they started hurling stones at Indian soldiers
 iske baad bhartiya javaanon ne bhi pathar phenke
 The situation came under control shortly after the incident
 isse pehle doklam ko lekar bharat or china ke bich pichley kareeb do maheenon se tanatani jari he
 The Doklam region is located on the indo-china-bhutan tri-function near Sikkim
 yah ilaaka bhutan kii seemaa main padataa he, lekin china ise donglong praant bataate hue apana daawa karata he
 When China began efforts to build a road near Doklam in June this year, Indian troops intervened and halted their work
 darasal bhutan ke saath hue samjhaute ke tahat bharat apane is padosi mulk kii samprabhutaa kii raksha ke liye patibaddh he
 In such a situation, it becomes natural to interfere
 vahiin china kaa kahana he ki vah apane ilaake main sadak bana rahaa he or bhartiya sena ke dakhal ko 'atikaraman' qaraar diya he
 Since then, China has been asking for the withdrawal of its troops from India, making war statements
 darasal china jis jagah ke paas sadak bana rahaa he, vah bharat kaa 'chikan nek' kahalaane vaale hisse ke behad kareeb sthit he
 This area, connecting the North Eastern states with the rest of the country, is just 20 kilometers wide and is strategically important for India

 Householders, neighbors, neighborhoods and even policemen start looking for him from day one
 ek haftaa bitta he
 Two weeks passed
 teesraa or chauthaa haftaa bhi biit jaataa he
 But neither the call of kidnapping nor the news of any body is found
 phir sava maheene baad bachche ke pados vaale ghar se badboo kii shakl main suraag baahar aata he or ye suraag na sirf bachche kaa raaj kholta he, balki uske saath darindon jaise bartaav karne vaale khooni ankal kaa dil dahala dene vaala sach bhi kholkar rakh detaa he
 Suddenly, the missing child was playing in the streets of the innocent Ashish Mohalla till about 5
15 pm on January 7 evening
 lekin pandrah minute guzarate-guzarate wo achaanak kahin gaayab ho gaya
 At first, people did not even know about his disappearance, but until someone did not see him for a long time, restlessness increased
 ab puraa mohallabache kii talashmen lag gaya
 And these included his uncle, Uncle Awadhesh, living in the neighborhood
 police se shikayataur to or jald hi is silsile main police se bhi shikaayat kii gai or police ne gharavaalon or padosiyon ke saath-saath pados main rahane vaale bachche ke munhabhole ankal avadhesh se bhi poochtacha kii
 But even then the police did not even notice that Awadhesh could be behind the disappearance of innocent Ashish
 khud ko sibiai afasar bataata tha aaropsal main bachche ke gharavaalon se avadhesh ke behad achche rishte the
 He was not only a resident of his village but also lived with the family of the first child
 or to or wo aas-pados main bhi avadhesh ne khud sibiai ofisar bataa rakhaa tha or kahata tha ki wo upiessi kii taiyaari kar rahaa he
 He had also looted many boys from the neighborhood to get government jobs due to their access and power
 kehane kii zarurat nahin he ki in hawaabaziyon kii badaulat avadhesh kii naa sirf bachche ke ghar main balki mohalle main bhi acchhee khaasi izzat thi
 Even on the disappearance of the child, he had reached the police station with the child's father to write a report
 laash ko suutakes main daalkar rakhaaaise main police swaroop nagar se lekar bihar main bachche ke gaanv tak kii khaak chaanati rahi
 And then in this way, the time of the month of Ashish disappeared
 udhar, avadhesh ke kamare main rakhi bachche kii laash sadane lagi thi
 However, to avoid being caught, the murderer made all kinds of efforts
 usne laash ko naa sirf ek polithine ke packet main pack kar rakhaa tha balki use ek bade se suutakes main bharkar acchhee tarah band kar diya tha
 Perfume was sprayed to reduce the smell, but in spite of this the smell started increasing with each passing day from the corpse
 padosiyon ko shaq naa ho isliye wo apane kamare main tarah-tarah ke parafum chhidakta rahaa
 But when the stench did not stop, he showed the dead rats out of his room and then he started hiding in the room every other day by hitting the mice and after showing the smell, the dead rats would be shown to the neighbors
 police ko gumraah karata rahaa aaropiaise main police qaatil or makatool ke aas-paas hone ke baavjood un tak nahin pahunch paa rahi thi
 In this connection, Awadhesh was questioned by the police several times, but each time he failed to mislead the police
 lekin kareeb sava maheene guzarane ke baad dhire-dhire police ke shaq kii sui avadhesh par jaakar hi tikne lagi
 There were many reasons for this
 bachche kii bahan ne kiya khulaaspub avadhesh kaa vyavhaar badalane laga tha wo aksar apana mobile phone switchd of rakhane laga tha
 In a CCTV footage, he was also seen going with the child
 usne bachche ko ek cycle dilaane kii bhi baat kahi thi, lekin iske bare main ghar main kisi ko bataane se manaa kiya tha
 The child's sister later told this to her family members
 sakht poochtacha main khulaa katl kaa rajaise main jab police ne aakiri baar avadhesh se poochtacha kii to wo tut gaya
 He confessed that he had not only kidnapped Ashish for seven years, but had killed him by drinking a heap within one hour of the kidnapping
 shav ko suutakes main pack kar diya tha
 But in order to avoid being caught, he was not only pretending to find him, but he also got the FIR done with the child's father
 bisisiai banaam lalit modi ke bich jang main hamale kii shuruyaat ho chuki he
 After waiting for the first injury from the BCCI, the wait now is for Modi to retaliate
 kayaas lagaae ja rahe hai ki bisisiai gavarning council kii meeting main modi par shikanja or majboot kar saktaa he to vahiin modi court bhi ja sakate hai
 The last ball of the final match of IPL 3 was bowled on Sunday night and here the BCCI announced the dismissal of Lalit Modi from the IPL
 kuch ghante ke baad hi bisisiai kii gavarning council kii baithak hone vaali he or jaahir si baat he ipel se nilamban ke baad baithak main bisisiai ab modi ko gherne kii antim taiyaari karegaa
 Of course, Lalit Modi will no longer be a part of this meeting, but according to the news, BCCI has fixed four charges on Modi
 pehla ipel ke qaraar main paardarshita nahin
 The second allegation is that the facility fee recovered from the franchisee did not go to the board's account
 teesraa aarope ye ki modi ne ipel se judi aadhikarik suchanaaen saarvajanik kii or modi par chauthaa aarope he anushaasanheenata kaa
 Lalit Modi may not have opened his tongue openly after his suspension, but in a special phone conversation with Aaj Tak on Monday night at 1
22 pm after the final, he indicated his forward strategy
 modi ne kaha 'mujhe ipel ke kamishnar pad se hataanaa jaij nahin gairasanvaidhanik he
 This is an absurd decision and i will give a befitting reply to this decision soon
 'idhar lalit modi ko gherne kii taiyaari bisisiai kii he to modi bhi agle hamale ke liye puri tarah se qamar kas chuke hai
 It is believed that Lalit Modi can challenge his suspension in the court of BCCI
 modi shuru se ye kehete aae hai ki agar nilamban yaa barkhaastagi hui to wo kai chehron ko benakaab karenge

 Akhilesh Yadav is the son of Mulayam Singh Yadav and he has learned all the tricks of politics from his father but despite being at the helm of power, Mulayam continues to dominate Akhilesh
 akhilesh ne jo daanv mulaayam singh yadav ke saath khelaa, ab usee daanv se mulaayam singh yadav ne akhilesh ko pashopesh main daal diya he
 Akhilesh played his trump on Monday saying that the party should never be broken and also reiterated his commitment citing conspiracies towards the party and Netaji
 isse party ko todane ke aaropon ko akhilesh ne khatm kar diya
 The outgrowth of a passionate son but the father had no effect
 shivpal ke saath khadey mulaayam singh yadav ne apane bhaashan main mukhtaar ansaari ke parivaar ko ek eemaandaar parivaar bataaya, amar singh ko apana bhai bataaya or kaha ki wo abhi kamazor nahin hue hai
 Mulayam said that at one of his behest, all the youth will stand with him
 mulaayam singh ke bhaashan se spasht ho gaya he ki wo apane upar kisi bhi tarah kaa akshep nahin lenaa chaahate or na hi kisi ek ko atishaktishaalee banaakar dekhnaa chaahate hai
 Netaji has rejected Akhilesh's four-and-a-half-year power and post
 gend waapas akhilesh ke paale menmulaayam singh yadav ne ab gend ko waapas akhilesh yadav ke paale main oochaal diya he
 Mulayam Singh has made it clear that he is not ready to compromise in any way, through statements such as pride of power and away from the dignity of the party
 ab vikalp akhilesh ke saamne hai ki wo apane ghutane tekkar mulaayam singh yadav ke camp kiprabhusattako sweekaar karen or party se lekar sarkaar tak nirnay lene ke apane ecchhatra adhikaar ko tyaag den
 If they are not ready to do this, then another situation may be that Akhilesh should leave the party and prepare his political supremacy
 akhilesh ke liye ab yahi sabase badi chunauti he ki mulaayam singh kii is jabardast patkani se wo kaise ubarte hai or aage kya rasta chunate hai
 Akhilesh Yadav now has the option of rebellion in order to save and remain in politics
 jhukna unako us qatari main kaaphi peeche laakar khadaa kar degaa jiske sabase aage wo khadey hai
 After the ninth case of student suicides in IIT Kanpur on Thursday in the last six years, the IIT administration is again considering banning internet usage of students residing in hostels from 12 pm to 6 am
 vaise santhaan main prayek varsh aatmahatya ke maamalon ke baad adhikari bayaan dete hai ki chaatr internet zyada istemaal karne se maansik tanaav main rahete he isiliye unke raat ke internet istemaal par pabandi laga di jaani chahie
 After the suicide of a btech first year student living in the hostel on September 22, Mahtab has once again engaged in this exercise
 iaiti ke register sanjeev kashalkar ne kaha ki iaiti ke chaatr chaatraon ko maansik tanaav se bachaane ke liye santhaan raat baarah baje se subah chah baje tak intnet par roak lagane par vichaar kar rahaa he
 However, he said that the proposal in this regard will be placed before the Students' Union, then it will be sent to the Dean Student Welfare
 sabaki sahmati milane par hi ise lagu kiya jaayegaa
 The registrar was asked whether such proposals were brought earlier but why were not implemented so far
 is par unhone kaha ki santhaan main loktantric prakriya (demokrasi) he isaliye sabaki sahmati jaruri hoti he
 Preliminary investigation into the Mehtab case has revealed that he used to spend a lot of time on the internet, so this time this proposal will be seriously considered
 kashalkar ne bataaya ki puraa iaiti parisar vaai faai internet suvidha se las he or aksar chatravaason main chaatr der raat tak internet kaa istemaal karte hai
 When he comes to class or goes to take an exam in the morning, he is not refreshed due to which his mind is neither engaged in studies nor in examination
 ve dhire dhire maansik tanaav kaa shikaar ho jate hai
 The registrar said that five thousand students study in iits, so it is not possible to go to each student's room to find out which students have slept or who have not
 isaliye prashasan der raat tak internet ke istemaal par roak kaa aadesh jari karne par vichaar kar rahaa he
 He said that when the new session of iits started in the month of July, the administration had advised the parents not to buy laptops from first year students at least for now
 register kehete he ki abhi naye chaatro ko laptaap kii koi khaas jarurat nahin he
 As far as work on internet is concerned, the institute has a computer center, library and all departments also have Internet and wi-fi system available
 chaatr chaatrayen vahaan jaakar kaam kar sakate hai
 But this opinion of the institute was also not implemented and many new students have laptops
 iaiti ke sutara bataate he ki bahut se chaatr subah chaar baje tak apane laptaap par internet main kaam karte rahete he or uske baad maatr do se teen ghante kii neend lekar kakshaon main yaa pariksha dene pahunch jate he
 Due to lack of sleep, he stays under stress and often takes suicidal steps like suicide when the form deteriorates and the number comes down
 register kehete he ki chaatr chaatraon ke liye counselling kii vyavastha bhi santhaan main kii gayi he taaki agar unhen koi samasya ho to vah aakar us bare main baatcheet karen
 Yoga centers, sports grounds and other recreational facilities are also places where students can entertain themselves
 gauratlab he ki iaiti main pichley chah saalaan main nau chaatr chaatrayen maansik tanaav ke kaaran aatmahatya kar chuke hai
 Home Minister Amit Shah's rally in Maharashtra was fiercely targeted for the ncp-congress, the country's security was removed for the country
 Article 370 Union Home Minister Amit Shah in Maharashtra said on Kashmir issue that we do not want any other country to interfere on the issue
 america raashtrapati hon yaa koi or, pradhanmantri narendra modi ji ne spasht shabdon main kaha ki kashmir hamaara aantarik maamla he, isamen hastkshep na karen
 Amit Shah said these things while addressing an election rally in Chikhali, Buldhana
 amit shah ne kaha ki 70 saal se aatankwaad ke kaaran kashmir main 40 hajaar se zyada log maare gaye
 Despite this, the Congress and NCP continued to oppose the removal of 370 for their vote bank politics
 magar bhaajapa ke liye desh kii suraksha, hamaari sarkaron se zyada mahatvapurn he, isliye hamane 370 ko hataa diya
 NCP Congress family parties Amit Shah said that ncp-congress is a party for their family while BJP is a party for the country

 On one side there is BJP and Shiv Sena under the leadership of Narendra Modi ji, on the other side there is NCP and Congress
 'beton ke vikaas ke liye kaam'amit shah ne kaha ki buldhana jila na keval vidarbha or maharashtra ke liye balki puure desh ke liye bahut mahatvapurn he, kyonki yah mata jijabai kii janmasthali he

 The BJP has done the job of providing such transparent governments
 amit shah ne kaha ki congress kii jitani bhi sarkarein raheen, sabhi ne vidarbha ke saath anyaay kiya tha
 The BJP has done justice to Vidarbha as well as to take it forward on the path of development
 hamane samgr maharashtra kaa vikaas kiya he, yahi hamaari samskruti he
 Expressing satisfaction over the public maintaining peace and harmony after the High Court verdict on the Ayodhya dispute, the Central Government said that the decision is not going to be implemented today so there is no need to comment on the court verdict
 kendriya grih mantri pi chidambaram ne kaha ki yah faisla haalanki mahatvapurn he lekin aaj karyanvit nahin hone ja rahaa he
 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has also said that the right conclusion at this time is that the status quo will be maintained until the Supreme Court considers the matter

 The demolition of the Babri Masjid cannot be justified in any way
 meri najar main vah ek aapraadhik maamla he
 Chidambaram said that the media is also over-interpreting yesterday's decision
 main samachar channelon se aagrah karuunga ki ve is faisle kii vyakhya main kam samay den or akhabaaron se apil karuunga ki ve iske liye kam jagah den
 On the alleged statement given by the Mayawati government about the responsibility of the Center in the event of any deterioration in the law and order situation, he said that it is the job of the Uttar Pradesh government to maintain law and order and the Center is helping him in this work
 yadi aisa bhi he ki kanoon vyavastha kaayam karnaa kendra kaa kaam he or uttar pradesh sarkaar usamen madad kar rahi he to bhi thik he
 On the alleged remarks made by SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav about the impact in the coming time of the decision, Chidambaram said that we have no apprehension of any kind
 ham apana kaam kar rahe hai or vah kaam he kanoon vyavastha kaayam karnaa
 We are doing it well

 jab jammu-kashmir kaa vilay kiya gaya, to kuch sharten lagu thim jinamein anuchhed 370 ke tahat ghati ko kuch visheshadhikaar die gaye
 But Narendra Modi 2
 0 ne apane kaarykaal ke pehle hi loksabhaa satr main is mudde par vijay paa lee
 Union Home Minister Amit Shah came to the Lok Sabha on 5 August with a resolution proposing withdrawal of 370 from Jammu and Kashmir, division of states and union territory
 5 agast ko bill pesh karne se pehle amarnath yatra ko roka gaya, jammu-kashmir main phone-internet ko band kar diya gaya or rajanetaaon ko hiraasat main liya gaya
 With the increase in security in the valley, political agitation increased, the opposition targeted the government but no one knew what was going to happen
 loksabhaa main sarkaar ke paas bahumat tha lekin rajyasabha main bahumat nahin tha, iske baavjood bhaajapa ne is bill ko donon sadanon main aasaani se paas karavaaya
 From October 31, 2019, Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh became separate union territories
 bhaajapa abtak jise jawahar laal nehru kii galati maanakar congress par dosha lagaati ai he
 modi-shah pair 3 dominated the whole year
 amit shah kaa chunaav ladanaloksabhaa chunaav 2019 main bhartiya janata party ne kai aise daanv chale jo chaunkaane vaale the
 The biggest of these was Amit Shah, who is considered the president of the party and Chanakya, from Gandhinagar
 yah seat abhi tak bijepi ke louh purush laalkrishna adwani kii thi, lekin is baar party ne unhen tikat nahin diya or unki jagah amit shah ne chunaav ladaa
 Amit Shah was a Rajya Sabha MP before winning the election by a margin of millions of votes
 lekin ab vah sidhaa loksabhaa main aae or modi 2
 Became Home Minister in 0
 grih mantri kaa pad sanbhaalane ke baad amit shah ne kai kaam kiye jisamen 370 ko hataanaa, CAB lagu karnaa shaamil he
 As an MP, Shah makes his presence felt in the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha and completely dominates the opposition in the House

 The defeat of Rahul Gandhi in Amethi, the Congress fought the 2014 and 2019 elections keeping Rahul Gandhi ahead, but both times the Congress faced a bad defeat
 is baar yah haar or bhi buree thi kyonki khud adhyaksh rahete hue rahul gandhi apni paaramparik seat amethi se chunaav haar gaye
 Bharatiya Janata Party leader Smriti Irani defeated her in Amethi, before Smriti had lost there in the 2014 elections
 haalanki is baar rahul gandhi ne sirf amethi nahin balki kerala kii vynad seat se bhi chunaav ladaa tha, bhale hi rahul amethi se chunaav haar gaye ho lekin vynad se jeet gaye
 Amethi Lok Sabha seat is considered the traditional seat of Gandhi family, from which Sanjay Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi, Sonia Gandhi have won the election
 2004 se hi rahul gandhi amethi se saansad the

 bengal main khilaa camel2014 main jab puure desh main modi lahar chali to kuch ek hi rajya the jahaan par iskaa asar nahin dikhaai diya
 These included Bengal but in 2019 this picture completely changed
 kyonki bengal is baar puri tarah bhagavamay ho gaya tha
 Out of the 42 Lok Sabha seats in Bengal, the Bharatiya Janata Party won 18 Lok Sabha seats while Mamata Banerjee's Trinamool Congress was reduced to just 22 seats
 bhartiya janata party kaa bengal main vot pratishat bhi kaaphi badha jo aane vaale vidhansabha chunaav ke liye mamata banerjee kii sabase badi chunauti mana ja rahaa he

 rafel vimaan vivadacongress party kii taraf se 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main sabase bada mudda rafel vimaan vivaad kaa banaaya gaya
 The then Congress President Rahul Gandhi alleged that there was a mess in the Rafale plane deal and this was done directly by Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 rahul kaa aarope tha ki narendra modi ne anil ambani ko phayda pahunchane ke liye is deal main gadabad kii he lekin congress kaa yah daanv fail ho gaya
 On this issue, Rahul raised the slogan of 'chowkidar Chor Hai'
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi reversed the same and launched the slogan 'main Bhi Chowkidar' which applied to the Bharatiya Janata Party like the 'chaiwale' campaign of 2014
 ye vivaad supreme court tak pahunchaa, supreme court kii ore se bhi modi sarkaar ko raahat mili or is vimaan kii kharid prakriya ko sahi paaya gaya

 karnataka main oparation lotus2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav se pehle 2018 main karnataka main vidhansabha chunaav hue the, yahaan par bhartiya janata party bahumat se kuch hi seat kam rah gai thi
 After which Congress and JDS formed government together and it became a new formula of opposition
 pehle bies yediurppa mukhyamantri bane lekin baad main vah bahumat sabit nahin kar paae or phir echdi kumaraswami mukhyamantri bane
 However his government fell within 6 months after which the Bharatiya Janata Party once again formed the government in the state and BS Yeddyurappa became the Chief Minister
 congress jedies kii ore se 17 vidhayakon ne istipha de diya tha, jinhen ayogy qaraar de diya gaya tha, baad main unhen supreme court se raahat mili or dobaaraa chunaav ladane kii ijaajat bhi mil gai
 In the recently held by-elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party has won a big win in 15 seats and the BJP government is completely in majority in Karnataka

 His fellow Shiv Sena, who has been cursing the Bharatiya Janata Party by staying in the new political picture of Maharashtra, surprised everyone in Maharashtra this time
 bijepi or shivasena ke gathbandhan ne vidhansabha chunaav ek saath ladaa lekin chunaav nateezon ke baad shivasena mukhyamantri pad ko lekar ad gai or usne bijepi se gathbandhan tod diya
 After which Shiv Sena joined with Congress and NCP, after a long political drama, the three formed a joint government
 bijepi or shivasena kaa 25 saal kaa saath isi ke saath khatm ho gaya or abtak kattar hindutv kii raajnneeti karne vaali shivasena congress or ensipi jaisi secular partiyon ke saath aa khadi hui
 With this, this was the first time that a member of the Thackeray family had become the Chief Minister
 uddhav thakare ne gathbandhan sarkaar kii kaman sanbhali or rajya ke mukhyamantri ke pad kii shapath lee

 priyanka kii raajnneeti main entrichunavi nateezon ke lihaaj se bhale hi 2019 congress ke liye acha naa rahaa ho lekin party ke hisaab chahie aitihaasik hi rahaa
 Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, another generation member of the Gandhi family, officially joined politics this year
 priyanka gandhi ko loksabhaa chunaav se pehle purvi uttar pradesh kii jimmedaari di gai, unhone lagaataar har seat par jaakar prachaar bhi kiya
 However, the Congress did not get the results as expected
 priyanka isse pehle bhi raibareli or amethi main apane bhai or apni maa ke liye prachaar karti ain hai lekin ab aupchaarik taur par raajnneeti par aa gayi hai or soshal media ke jariye modi sarkaar par hamalavar hai

 adhyaksh pad se rahul gandhi kaa hatanaloksabhaa chunaav main karaari haar ke baad rahul gandhi ne party adhyaksh ke pad se istife kaa elaan kar diya tha lekin party main isse hadakamp much gaya
 For several days, efforts were made to persuade Rahul Gandhi and the Congress party leaders at the state level across the country submitted their resignations
 lekin rahul gandhi nahin maane or apane istife par ade rahe, jiske baad congress kaarysmiti ne us sthiti ko sweekaar bhi kiya
 When Rahul stepped down, the Congress had a leadership crisis and at such a time, Sonia Gandhi once again took command
 sonia ke kaman sambhalate hi congress main old guard ek baar phir active ho gaye or party aage badhane lagi
 Sonia Gandhi played an important role in the way Congress formed the government with Shiv Sena keeping the ideology aside
 11
 Sadhvi Pragya's entry, a Bharatiya Janata Party decision in Digvijay's Harlok Sabha election surprised everyone
 madhyapradesh ke bhopal se bijepi ne is baar maalegaanv blast main aaropee or jamaanat par baahar chal rahi sadhvi pragna singh thakur ko tikat de diya, bhopal se congress kii ore se digvijay singh chunaav lard rahe the
 Pragya won the election easily but it caused quite a ruckus
 bhaajapa ne sadhvi ko tikat dekar apane hindutv ke agenda ko aage badhaayaa or ek nae vivaad ko janm diya
 After being elected as an MP, Sadhvi Pragya continued to be in the limelight due to her controversial statements, whether to call Nathuram Godse, the killer of Mahatma Gandhi, as a patriot or to make controversial statements about the martyr Hemant Karkare
 sadhvi ke bayaan par pradhanmantri modi kah chuke hai ki unhen dil se kabhi bhi maaf nahin kar paaenge

 vipaksh is bill ko samvidhan ke virdohi or alpsankhyakon ke khilaaf bataata rahaa lekin sarkaar ne is bill ko aasaani se paas kara diya
 Political experts also believe that through this bill, the Bharatiya Janata Party is pursuing the assembly elections in West Bengal

 Following the cancellation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir, the situation in the valley is slowly returning to normal
 lekin yah baat aatankwaadiyon or unke aakaaon ko hajam nahin ho rahi he
 They are restless with the improving condition of the valley
 aatankwaadi jammu-kashmir ke logon main dar kaa maahaul paidaa karne kii koshish main lage hue hai
 The fury is so high that the terrorists are busy threatening people by employing posters in the valley
 ab shopiyaan main hijbul mujahidin ke poster lagaae gaye hai
 Through this poster, the terrorists have tried to threaten especially the government employees
 iske alaava transporter, seb kaarobaariyon ko dhamkee di he
 Not only this, terrorists are resorting to killings of people to create fear in the people of the valley

 In addition, a truck driver was killed in the killing of a shopkeeper in Srinagar city and stone pelting at the behest of a militant in Bijbehra area

 postaron ke jariye dukandaaron, transportron or anya logon ko sandesh diya gaya he ki agar ve saamaanya gatividhiyon ko phir se shuru karne kaa prayaas karte hai to iske gambhir parinaam bhugatne padenge
 Some masked youths have also reportedly appeared in some mosques in Srinagar and Sopore
 unhone logon ko saamaanya gatividhiyon ko phir se shuru nahin karne kii chetavanee di
 Unlike before, this time mosques are also not being used to provoke emotions
 ek varisht police adhikari ne kaha, 'yah aatankwaadiyon ke liye ek badi chintaa kaa vishay he
 That is why they are resorting to the killings of civilians and threatening them
 is tarah kii ranneeti unke liye hi nuksaandeh he kyonki aam aadmi ne unke ishaaron par chalane se manaa kar diya he

 mandsaur main kisaanon par golicond kaa ek maheenaa puraa hone par desh ke lagbhag 200 kisaan sanghathan kisaan mukti yatra kaa aayojan karenge
 It will start from Mandsaur on March 6 and reach Delhi on July 18 via Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana
 raste main yah yatra bardoli or kheda jaise kisaan andolan ke aitihaasik sthalon par bhi jayega
 After reaching Delhi, this march will take the form of a front at Jantar Mantar

 The All India Kisan Sangharsh Samiti issued a statement saying that both this Yatra and Morcha will be conducted under the aegis of the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee

 This coordination of the Kisan agitation around the country is made in a historical time
 kisaan vidroh par utar aayaa he
 The unprecedented strike by the farmers of Maharashtra and the martyrdom of the farmers of Mandsaur gave a new energy to the peasant movement
 desh ke kone-kone main kisaan or unke sthaneey sanghathan apni buniyadi maangon ko lekar apane tareeke se virodh pradarshan kar rahe hai
 With a glimpse of the power of the farmer, governments, parties and media have all been forced to pay attention to the issues of the farmer
 yahkisaan vidrohdesh ke kisaan ke jivan main buniyadi parivartan laa sake iske liye yah anivaary he ki kisaan kii bikhri shakti ko ek sutara main baandha jaae or ek deshvyapee kisaan andolan kii vyavasthit taiyaari kii jaae jisase is andolan kii disha spasht ho
 Asrar-ul Hasan Khan, Majrooh Sultanpuri, a progressive thinker of the history of poetry in India, who could not stop writing the fear of jail nor who ever liked the interferes of anyone in his writing
 wo shaks jisane bharat kii shaayari or bollywood ke geeton ko ek alag andaaj diya
 However, the story is not just that full
 lafjon kii adaayagi or unki samaj majaruuh sahab main paidaaish ke baad hi shuru ho gai thi
 When the country was fighting the freedom struggle under the leadership of big Congress leaders like Mahatma Gandhi and Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, Majrooh was born in Azamgarh, UP on 1 October in 1919
 majaruuh ek rajput parivaar main paidaa hue the, lihaaja khandaani parampara ke tahat unhen bhi schuli shiksha se dur rakhaa gaya or dini talim ke liye madrase bheja gaya
 In an interview, he said that Rajputs were born to fight, not to read
 footbal khilne par laga fatwamadarase main ilm hasil karne ke saath hi majaruuh ko footbal khilne kaa shauk lag gaya
 But those who gave the game the title did not like it and fatwaed them and were thrown out
 madrase se majaruuh ne arabi or farsi kii talim pai
 After this Lucknow traveled and started studying Hikmat (unani Medicine)
 tehseeldaar kii beti se mohabbat huihakim banakar waapas aae or faijabad ke tanda main hakimi karne lage
 Here Shayari became fond of it and this young poet fell in love with the daughter of the Tehsildar, which he was not allowed at all
 lihaaja, nateeja ye hua ki jaisi-taisi hakimi chal rahi thi, wo bhi tehseeldaar ke dar se chhodkar majaruuh sahab ko apane sultanpur lautnaa padaa
 Gradually, his poetry began to fall on Hikmat and he became famous
 is dauraan unhone us vakt ke mashhoor shaayar jigar muradaabadi ko ustad bana liya
 a Mushaira composed lyricist is a matter of 1945, when once with Jigar Muradabadi he moved to Mumbai to join Mushayara
 us mushaayare main kai film mekars bhi the, jinamein abdur raashid kardaar bhi maujuud the
 In Mushaira, Majrooh Sahib also read his poetry and received many accolades
 mushaayare ke baad e
 r Kardar offered to write lyrics for his film Shah Jahan from Jigar Muradabadi
 jigar ne isse inkaar karte hue ball majaruuh ke paale main phenk di or kardaar ko unki pasand par bharosa karnaa padaa
 SANJU: these 12 photos are looking exactly like Sanjay's copy, Ranbir, although Majrooh himself was not ready to write the film song, but Ustad Jigar Muradabadi said he could not avoid it and wrote the song
 majaruuh kaa pehla githfilm shahjahan 1946 main relies hua or isamen majaruuh sahab kaa pehla gaanaa 'jab dil hi tut gaya
 
 
 What will we do 
 
 ' liya gaya
 In this song, it is as if Majrooh tried to show the image of his incomplete love to the daughter of the Tehsildar, which he had to leave in Tanda, Faizabad
 naushaad sahab ne is geet ko sangeet diya or ke
 S
 Sehgal sang it in a very sweet manner
 is geet se sahagal saabah itnaa mutassir hue the ki unhone apane antim sanskaar ke vakt is geet ko bajaane kii vasiyat kii thi or unki maut ke vakt aisa hi kiya gaya
 Did not ask for the words of apology from Nehru to the hearts of the people through the film song, their revolutionary alphas were also making the same headlines
 aazaadee se pehle se lekar duniya se rukhsat hone tak majaruuh sahab ne har vakt main apane fan kii misaal pesh kii
 He not only had alphas in his heart for love poetry, but he also used his pen on the current situation of the country
 jiske liye unhen na paariwarik museebataan jhelni padin, balki jail tak janaa padaa
 ranveer-deepika will take seven rounds in November! In fact, after the independence, Jawaharlal Nehru became the first Prime Minister
 apni ek kavita main unhone nehru ke khilaaf tippanee kii
 These remarks went a long way to Nehru and his loyalists
 lihaaja, majaruuh ko bolaa gaya ki wo nehru se maafee maange
 But Majrooh stubbornly insists
 satta kii dhamkiyon kaa unpar koi asar nahin hua or unhone saaf kah diya ki jo likh diya, so likh diya or iske baad majaruuh ko kareeb 2 saal ke liye mumbai kii jail main daal diya gaya
 This role was offered to Aamir in 'sanju', because of this, he refused to go for these lines
 There is also a Hitler who does not want to go with Chelamar, is a slave of the Commonwealth, does not know how to take companionship with Nehru, not only he likes the work of Sultanpuri
 Ia was, but it was also awarded
 majaruuh pehle aise geetkaar the, jinhen dadasahab phalke sammaan diya gaya
 This honor will be given to him by the song 'chahta main tujhe saanjh savere, yet sometime now' naam tere
 
 i will not give voice 
 'given for
 'main akelaa hi chalaa tha jaanib-e-manzil magar, log saath aate gaeor kaaravaan banataa gaya
 
 
 We are like 'majrooh Sultanpuri writing lion' 
 
 
 Will smell 
 
 banake kali, banake sabaa
 
 
 In Bagh-e Waka

 The political drama has resumed after about seven months in the Karnataka political crisis
 congress(congress)or bijepi (BJP) ke bich 'resort raajnneeti' chal rahi he
 Three centers of this political nurakushti have been formed
 ek centre khud soobe kii rajdhani bengalooru he to doosraa gurugram or teesraa mumbai
 In the resort of Gurugram, BS Yeddyurappa, the chief ministerial contender from BJP (BJP), with all 104 BJP mlas, is there
 udhar congress ke teen vidhayak mumbai ke renicense hotel main ruke hue hai
 These mlas are said to be dissatisfied with the Congress and close to the BJP
 haalanki congress(congress) kaa kahana he ki sabhi vidhayak unke sampark main hai
 Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy himself has also said that there is no threat to his government in any way
 jabaki donon paksh ek duusare par vidhayakon kii kharid-farokht kii koshishon kaa aarope laga rahe hai
 Leaders of bjp's Yeddyurappa camp say that Operation Lotus will succeed this time
 sutron ke mutabiq do nirdaleeyon ko chhod or 9 vidhayak hai jo bijepi (BJP) ke sampark main hai
 There are speculations of 4 rebel mlas reaching Mumbai
 isse pehle kal do vidhayakon ne congress-jedies sarkaar se apana samarthan waapas le liya tha
 Here, the Karnataka Congress has called a meeting of its Legislature Party on 18 January
 congress-jedies kaa kahana he ki unki sarkaar ko koi khatara nahin hai
 The two mlas who withdrew their support to the assembly speaker withdrew support to the government, including KPJP MLA and former Karnataka forest minister r Shankar and Independent h Nagesh
 congress ne mumbai ke hotel main ruke apane teenon vidhayakon ko jald waapas bengalooru lautne ko kaha he
 Gurugram remains a center of drama in Karnataka, where 104 BJP mlas are at ITC Grand India, a hotel near Gurgaon
 purv mukhyamantri yediurppa ne somvaar ko congress par jod tod kaa aarope lagaaya or kaha ki wo unke kuch vidhayakon ko mantri pad or duusare laalach de rahe hai
 However, it is not so easy for the BJP to create these four kinds of situations to bring down the government of Janata Dal (S) and Congress alliance
 yahi vajah he ki bies yediurppa ke utaavlepan ke baavjood bijepi netritv jaldbaaji ke mood main nahin he
 Sources are telling that the top leadership of the BJP has clearly told BS Yeddyurappa that unless the party has enough numbers in the state to reassure it, it will not take the initiative to execute Operation Kamal
 darasal, loksabhaa chunaav najadik aa rahaa he
 In such a situation, if the BJP fails to form the government again, then it will have to bear a lot of criticism
 darasal, may main chunavi nattejey aane ke baad bijepi 104 siton ke saath sabase badi party banakar ubhari thi
 Governor Vajubhai invited the BJP to form the government
 bahumat ke liye jaruri 112 siton kaa aankada na hone ke baavjood yediurppa sarkaar ban gai thi
 The governor gave opportunities to prove his majority in 15 days
 magar supreme court ne ek hi din kaa mauka diya
 Yeddyurappa had to resign due to lack of majority
 jiske baad 80 siton vaali congress ne 37 siton vaale janata dal secular ke netaa echdi kumaraswami ko samarthan dekar mukhyamantri banaaya
 After some time, now there is political upheaval in the province again
 congress jahaan bijepi par vidhayakon kii kharid-farokht kii koshishon kaa aarope laga rahi he, vahiin bijepi ise bebuniyaad bataa rahi he
 Indian industry stalwarts insisted on a rethink on the Reserve Bank of India's high interest rate policy, saying that the high cost of loans was negatively impacting the growth rate
 echesbisi kii pramukh naina laal kidawai ne haal hi ke ek adhyayan ke hawaale se kaha ki adhikansh companiyon kaa maananaa he ki mudrasphiti tathaa nitigat daron main kai baar kii badhotaree kaa asar udyog jagat ke pradarshan par padane laga he
 He said, "the industry is concerned about rising inflation and the impact of interest rates on its operations
 rigerv bank dwaara daron main or badhotaree kaa nakaaratmak asar nivesh yojanaon par ho saktaa he
 The top officials of the Reserve Bank held a traditional meeting on May 3 ahead of the proposed annual monetary policy announcement
 rigerv bank ne mudrasphiti par niyantran ke liye beete 13 maah main nitigat daron main aath baar badhotari kii he
 Assocham President Dilip Modi said that the Reserve Bank should 'review the need to restore tight monetary policy during the current financial year
 ' taaki karporate jagat ko rin pravaah bade tathaa audyogic nishpaadan sudhare
 Leading retailer Niranjan Hiranandani said the increase in rates has had a negative impact especially on home buyers for the first time

 Mayawati's house at 13A Mall Avenue in Lucknow
 hathiyaarband gards ke saath chaar suraksha tower, contile taar or chaaron taraf balua pathar kii 18 foot oonchi deevaaren
 The Akhilesh Yadav government may have removed the barricades, which were installed by Mayawati at Mall Avenue as Chief Minister, but Mayawati still knows how to keep unwanted people out
 mutthi bhar party adhikariyon ko chhod den, to sadak ke kinare bana bahujan samaaj party (basapa) kaa karyaalay bhi utana hi suunaa lagata he
 The only sound heard here is that of TV which is only intensified when any news related to BSP comes
 yah najaara vikramaditya maarg par sthit samaajawaadee party (sapa) ke offis ke najaare se puri tarah alag he, jo get par haal hi main tainaat kiye gaye suraksha tantra ke baavjood party kaaryakartaaon or media se gulzaar he
 But inside 13 Mall Avenue, all the barriers have been reduced very closely
 ghar ke andar 43 intercom phone hai, jo pichley maheene ke dauraan raat-din bajte rahe hai, kyonki mayawati aagantukon kii baari bheed ke saath baithken kar rahi hai
 Except for three people - his younger brother Anand Kumar, Anand's wife Vichitralata and his daughter - all others belong to the BSP cadre
 jo log mayawati se mil chuke hai, un sabhi kaa kahana he ki haar kaa shuruaati jhatka kaaphi pehle hi khatm ho chukaa he
 She is eyeing a new target - Lok Sabha 2014
 uttar pradesh vidhansabha main vipaksh ke netaa or basapa ke pradesh adhyaksh swami prasad maury kehete hai, ''yah mat bhuuliye ki sapa netritv ke vipareet, mayawati ek rashtriya netaa hai
 This is one of the reasons for renouncing the membership of the Legislative Council and reaching Delhi as a Rajya Sabha member
 jab ve 24 april ko ucch sadan pahunchin, to sahyogi satish mishra ne unki agavaani kii or unki party ke baaki saansadon ne gulab ke guladaston ke saath unka swaagat kiya
 Smiling Mayawati, wearing a cream-colored salwar-kameez, did not waste much time in Parliament
 ve shapath lene ke baad baahar nikal ain or bilkul iradatan get par intjaar kar rahi pehali car kii ore chali gayi
 That car was Minister of State for External Affairs E
 ahamed kii thi, usamen laal batti lagi hui thi; jabaki mayawati kii ambeseder main koi laal batti nahin he
 Realizing the mistake, Mayawati asked Mishra slowly where her car was and then proceeded towards her
 basapa pramukh ne baad main media ko bataaya ki sansad main unka mishan ''sarvajan hitay, sarvajan sukhaay'' hoga
 He also criticized the Congress's move to nominate Sachin Tendulkar for the Rajya Sabha
 ''main is kadam ke peeche unke iraade bahut acchhee tarah se jaanati hum
 "he said without clarifying it
" lekin jab baat abhinetri rekha kii ai, jo mayawati kii apni virdohi jaya bachchan kii pratispardhi rahi hai, to mayawati ne bas yah kaha, ''main filmein nahin dekhati
 All my time is spent in strengthening my party
 ''jaahir taur par yah koi haari hui netaa nahin, balki ek aisi jujharu mahila thi, jo pehle hi apni agali chunauti par kaam karne main jute gai thi
 Both national parties are in bad shape and the next Lok Sabha is likely to go hung
 mayawati is chunauti ko sweekaar karne ke liye taiyaar hai
 Says a BSP leader, "mayawati hopes that the anti-incumbency trend in Uttar Pradesh will go against the SP
" ve bharat ke baaki hisson main party ko punerjeevit karne par sara dhyaan kendrit kar rahi hai
 "at a rally during elections in Uttar Pradesh, Mayawati said with some ambition," i have the master key to power
 '' ab ve yah sunishchit karne ke liye kadi mehnat kar rahi he ki yah sach sabit ho, na sirf uttar pradesh main balki shesh bharat main bhi
 The BSP is the third largest national party with an average 10 percent vote share across the country
 bhale hi party ko abhi dakshin main asar dikhaanaa baaki ho, lekin vastav main mayawati ne 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav abhiyaan kii shuruyaat keralase kii thi
 Apart from 80 mlas in Uttar Pradesh, the party currently has seven mlas in Madhya Pradesh, six in Rajasthan, three each in Uttarakhand and Delhi, two in Chhattisgarh, and one each in Haryana and Himachal Pradesh
 teen basapa vidhayakon ne uttarakhand main haal hi main sarkaar ke gathan main ek nirnaayak bhoomika nibhaai thi
 Both the Congress and the BJP were trying to pull him towards them
 un vidhayakon main se ek ab congress ke netritv vaali rajya sarkaar main mantri he
 Setting this as an example, Mayawati has asked party workers to ensure that the BSP has a similar role in Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Delhi, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh in the next assembly elections
 mayawati puri tarah agali ladaai ke liye taiyaar hai
 His attitude in Uttar Pradesh is a hallmark of this
 pradesh main party ke kaaryakartaaon se sapa ke khilaaf hamale tej karne ko kaha gaya he
 They are taking the lead on their own
 uttar pradesh ke vidhansabha chunaav main apni paraajay ke baad pehali baar uttar pradesh jane ke liye unhone ambedkar jayanti, 14 april kaa din tay kiya
 After paying floral tributes to Ambedkar's statue, he issued a stern warning to the Akhilesh Yadav government in response to these statements that the state government was planning to build hospitals in their Ambedkar parks
 unhone garajte hue kaha, ''dalit smarakon main pherbadal karne yaa unase judi jameen par kisi or cheez kaa nirmaan karne ke kisi bhi prayaas kaa nateeja na keval uttar pradesh balki puure desh main kanoon or vyavastha ke sankat ke rup main saamne aayega
 "A BSP leader in the Lok Sabha says that it was his thoughtful and clever move to install statues of Ambedkar, Kanshi Ram and himself
" ambedkar ke pautra omprakash ambedkar dwaara ek dainik main kii gai sampadakeey tippanee kii ore ishaara karte hue ve kehete hai, ''in pratimaaon kaa bharatbar main daliton ke liye ek bhaavnaatmak mahatv he
 Omprakash, who has generally criticized Mayawati, had repeated Mayawati's threat that if someone touched the idols, there would be a danger of law and order deteriorating
 in murtiyon ne daliton ko ekajute kiya he or bihar main ramvilas paswan or maharashtra main ramdaas athawale jaise anya dalit netaaon kii tulana main daliton ke sabase bade netaa ke rup main mayawati kaa kad bhi or ooncha kiya he
 Before the election results came, the word 'chief Minister' was written in brass letters on the door of the government house allotted to him at Mall Avenue, Lucknow
 unhone iske aage chaak se 'purv' shabd likhva diya he
 He is confident that the BSP will win by a majority in the next assembly elections and the word 'east' written with chalk will be wiped at the door
 teesri baar bihar ke mukhyamantri pad ke liye daavedaari jataa rahe nitish kumaar ke liye is baar bihar chunaav kii jang aasaan nahin he
 In ndtv's exit poll, the Nitish-led grand alliance is reported to have won 110 seats
 eczit pole main sabhi vidhansabha siton ke vistrut rup se 76,000 cemple ko liya gaya
 This shows that the BJP and its three local allies are winning around 125 seats in the state
 yah bihar main bahumat ke liye hasil sankhya se teen adhik he

 congress ne narendra modi ke is aarope ko khaarij kar diya ki rahul gandhi ne ‘janpratinidhiyon par laae gaye adhyadesh’ par hamalaa bol kar pradhanmantri pad kii garima ko kam kiya he
 It also alleged that the Chief Minister of Gujarat is misleading the country and ignoring his state, which is facing the threat of floods
 rashtriya rajdhani main ek raily main die modi ke bhaashan par pratikriya jaahir karte hue congress netaa rashid alvi ne kaha, rahul gandhi ne pradhanmantri ke naam kaa zikr tak nahin kiya
 He only expressed his views about the ordinance
 unhone sarkaar se ise waapas lene ko bhi nahin kaha
 Alvi alleged that it is Modi who is here to denounce Prime Minister Manmohan Singh with his remarks when he is meeting various heads of state in New York in the interest of the nation
 congress netaa ne aarope lagaaya ki gujarat ke mukhyamantri apane rajya ke logon ko ‘nazarandaaj’ kar rahe hai, jo baadh ke gambhir khatre kaa saamana kar rahaa he
 The comments alvi ne kaha, gujarat ke logon ko modi kii rajya main jarurat he
 It is unfortunate that he is ignoring his own people, who made him the Chief Minister and he is misleading the nation in Delhi
 isse pehle aaj, rahul par hamalaa bolte hue modi ne un par pradhanmantri pad kii garima kam karne kaa aarope lagaaya or janata se yah faisla karne ko kaha ki kya desh samvidhan ke tahat chalegaa yaa ‘yuvaraj’ kii marji se chalegaa
 Addressing his first rally in Delhi after being nominated as BJP candidate for the post of Prime Minister, Modi alleged, his party's dignity has been reduced to the Prime Minister's post
 congress upaadhyaksh ne pradhanmantri kaa anadar karne kaa paap kiya he
 Reacting to Modi's speech at a rally in the national capital, Congress leader Rashid Alvi said, "rahul Gandhi did not even mention the Prime Minister's name
" unhone sirf adhyadesh ke bare main apane vichaar jaahir kiye
 He did not even ask the government to withdraw it
 alvi ne aarope lagaaya ki vah modi hi hai, jo yahaan us vakt pradhanmantri manmohan singh kii apni tippaniyon se ninda kar rahe hai jab vah raashtra ke hit main vibhinn rashtradhyakshon se neuyork main mulaakaat kar rahe hai
 The Congress leader alleged that the Chief Minister of Gujarat is 'ignoring' the people of his state, who are facing grave danger of flooding

 yah durbhagyapurna he ki vah apane hi logon ko nazarandaaj kar rahe hai, jinhone unhen mukhyamantri banaaya tathaa vah dilli main raashtra ko gumraah kar rahe hai
 Earlier today, while attacking Rahul, Modi accused him of lowering the dignity of the post of Prime Minister and asked the people to decide whether the country will run under the Constitution or will run on the will of 'yuvraj'
 pradhanmantri pad ke liye bhaajapa se ummidavaar banaae jane ke baad dilli main apni pratham raily ko sambodhit karte hue modi ne aarope lagaaya, pradhanmantri pad kii garima ko unki hi party ne kam kar diya

 kolkata main mamata banerjee kii mega raily ke baad ab sawaal uthne laga he ki kya vipaksh sach main ekajute he? mamata ke bulaave par 22 dalon ke 44 netaa kuch is tevar main kolkata main jamaa hue the ki bhale hamaare dil mili na mili, lekin haath jarur milane chahie
 Mamta Banerjee has performed the biggest power show of Modi Stop campaign, but the gathering of leaders on one platform and going to the election field are two different things
 kyonki modi ke khilaaf 'vipaksh kaa ek ummidavaar' ab tak kii tasviir ke mutabik naammumkin lagata he
 The opposition's motive for removing Modi is clear, but what should be the way? Should a formula like UP be formed, where two powerful parties of the opposition have got together, but here Congress is not included in the alliance
 majaboor congress ko akele hi 80 siton par ladane kaa dam bharna pad rahaa he
 The Congress also has to fight with the BJP in many states who want to remove Modi
 inamen uttar pradesh ke alaava odisha, andhra pradesh, telugana or dilli shaamil hai
 In these states, the Congress has to fight the BJD and also the BJP in Odisha with 21 seats in the triangular fight
 17 siton vaale telugana main tiares, congress or bijepi donon ke khilaaf taal thok chuki he
 In the 25-seater Andhra Pradesh too, the TDP and Congress parted ways after only four days of friendship, who together do not want to allow the BJP to breach there
 7 siton vaale dilli main kuch dinon pehle tak bijepi ke khilaaf congress or aam aadmi party ke mil jane kii sugabgaahat jarur thi, lekin ab aisa kuch nahin hoga, ye tay he
 It is not yet decided that the Trinamool and the Congress should come together in the Bengal, which has seen the country becoming an ocean of opposition unity, with 44 Lok Sabha seats, not the Grand Alliance alone
 left to trinmul se alag rahegaa hi, lekin wo congress ke saath jayega yaa akele dam par trinmul or bijepi se do-do haath karegaa, is par tasviir saaf nahin hui he
 In all, there are 9 Tikoni fighting states with a total of 237 seats
 yani 543 siton main se 44 pratishat siton par bijepi ke khilaaf akelaa mahagathbandhan banataa nahin dikhataa
 Somewhere Congress vs BJP, somewhere Congress vs Left has separated from AGP and BJP after Citizenship Bill in Assam with 14 seats, BSP and Ajit Jogi's party together with Congress and BJP in Chhattisgarh with 11 seats
 20 siton vaale kerala main bijepi kii koi khaas takat nahin, jabaki vahaan aamane-saamne congress kii aguwai vaala front or left kii aguwai vaala front he
 Scattered Opposition Against BJP The BJP and Shiv Sena avenues are seen differently in the 48-seat Maharashtra
 yahaan jarur congress-ensipi saath he
 In Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Jammu and Kashmir, the opposition against the BJP may remain scattered in the fight
 lekin kolkata maano ye bataane main juta tha ki aise saare masale sulajhaa liye jaaenge
 The grand alliance is united in Bihar The most golden picture of forming a united grand alliance against the NDA is seen from Bihar, where Congress and other regional parties standing in opposition with Modi
 madhya pradesh, rajasthan or himachal pradesh jaise rajyon main congress sidhe bijepi se ladegi
 So despite the bjp-akali Dal in Punjab, the Congress is looking heavily at them alone
 shuukravaar, 27 sitambar ko chaturdashi tithi kaa shraadh he
 Shraddha is performed on Chaturdashi only for those who have died prematurely
 jinaki mrityu swaabhaavik tareeke se hui ho is din unka shraadh karnaa manaa he
 It is also said in the Mahabharata that on the Chaturdashi date, those who have died prematurely should be worshiped
 chaturdashi tithi par karen inkaa shraadhgin logon kii mrityu kisi durghatana main hui ho yaa kisi jahrile jaanavar ke kaatane se hui ho unka shraadh chaturdashi tithi par kiya jaataa he
 People committing murder, who have been killed or died with a weapon, are performed on Shraddha Chaturdashi date
 mahabharat main bhi jikennushasan parv main bhishma pitamah ne yudhisthir ko bataaya tha ki jin logon kii mrityu akaal hui he yani jinaki mrityu swaabhaavik tareeke se na hui ho, unka shraadh pitru paksh kii chaturdashi tithi par hi karnaa chahie
 Those who died naturally are not worshiped on this date
 panditon ke anusaar swabhaavik maut marane waalon kaa shraadh chaturdashi tithi par karne se shraadh karne vaale vyakti ko pareshaaniyaan uthaani pad sakati hai
 There is also a mention in the Koram Purana that Shraddha of the naturally dead people on Chaturdashi is not auspicious for children
 amavasya par karen vishesh shramavasya tithi par unka shraadh karen, jinaki mrityu tithi aapako yaad nahin hai
 On this day special shraddh should be performed for all the known and unknown fathers of the family
 pitaron ke naam par jaruratmandon ko dhan or anaaj kaa daan karen

 bollywood abhinetri rani mukherjee ne ravivaar raat apane juhu sthit bangale par kareebi doston ke saath diwaali manaai
 Rani was also accompanied by Aditya Chopra in this Diwali celebration
 aapako bataa den ki yash raaj film ke chiraag aditya ke saath rani kaa naam joda jaataa rahaa he, lekin unhone is rishte ko kabhi sabake saamne kabuula nahin

 Not only this, Pamela Chopra, wife of the late Yash Chopra, looked quite comfortable at Rani's house
 rani ne kabhi bhi aditya ke saath apane tathakthith rishte ko kabool nahin kiya
 On the other hand, Aditya always kept a distance from the media in this matter and kept trying his best not to get caught on camera with Rani
 baharhaal, rani ne diwaali par karan johar or koreographer vaibhavi marchent ko bhi bulaayaa tha

 mahila aarakshan kii maang uthaane vaale congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ke saamne modi sarkaar ne ek nai deal kii peshkash kii he
 In this deal, the Modi government has called for support from Rahul Gandhi in Parliament on issues like triple talaq along with the Women's Reservation Bill
 bijepi ke is prastaav par congress ne bhi palatwaar kiya he or sarkaar kii niyat par sawaal uthaae hai
 On the letter of Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad written to Rahul Gandhi, Congress leader Sushmita Dev said that the 2014 manifesto referred to triple talaq and women's reservation, not Halala
 unhone kaha ki pradhanmantri modi ne mahila aarakshan kii maang ko lekar sonia gandhi kii chithti kaa jawaab kyon nahin diya tha? sushmita ne aarope lagaaya ki mahila aarakshan dene kii unki niyat hi nahin he or kanoon mantri 'dealer' ban gaye hai
 In fact, the BJP continues to surround the Congress party, accusing it of not raising voice for Muslim women on issues such as the 'party of Muslims' and triple talaq
 is bich 16 july ko rahul gandhi ne pradhanmantri narendra modi ko patr likhakar 18 july se shuru ho rahe monsoon satr main mahila aarakshan vidheyak paas karne kii maang kii, jiske tahat sansad or rajya vidhansabhaon main mahilaon ke liye 33 pratishat aarakshan kii vyavastha he

 In a letter to Rahul, he offered a 'new deal'
 ravishankar ne likhaa, 'main chahta hum ki bijepi or congress mahilaon kii samanta or unki paryaapt bhagidaari ke liye saath aaen
 Under this new deal, we should also support legislation on issues like triple talaq and nikah halala along with women's reservation bill
 'apane patr main kanoon mantri ne ye bhi kaha kitin talaak or nikaah halalajise masale na sirf muslim mahilaon ke adhikaar se jude hai, balki unke sammaan kaa bhi sawaal he
 Taking a dig at Rahul Gandhi, he said that as a national party, there should be no double attitude towards women and their rights
 ravishankar prasad ne ye bhi likhaa kimahila aarakshan bilko lekar aapaki pahal kii ham prashansa karte hai
 The government also wants to know if you and your allies will also support the bill and will not disrupt the proceedings of the House
 bataa den ki rahul gandhi ne 16 july ko piem modi ko chitthee likhakar kaha he ki vah sansad main mahila aarakshan bill laaen, congress unka puraa samarthan karegi
 This bill was passed in the Rajya Sabha in the year 2010

 Who are they, how do they look and how do they carry out such a dangerous operation
 to ab ye baaten raaj nahin rahengi kyonki ab us shaks ne apana munh kholane kaa iraadaa kiya he jisane oparation neptune spiear main pehali goli chalaai
 For the first time the world is going to hear from the mouth of an American soldier who is saying that yes, i have killed Osama bin Laden
 yani puure saadhe teen saal pehle jab osama kii maut kii tasviren sari duniya ke tivi screen par ubhari thim to tamaam log dam sadhakar ek ek harakat ko gaur se dekh rahe the
 No one wanted to let even a frame of these pictures go because they do not know in which part of the picture that they see the eyes of all the world were always on the TV screen
 or is oparation ke mukammal hote hi duniya bhar ke tamaam aman pasand logon ke chehre khushi se khil uthe the
 After the success of Operation Neptune Spire, America had not only secretly located the corpse of the world's biggest terrorist, Osama, but it was specially taken care of that the marines and operations involved in this operation were taken care of
 The identity of any of the senior officers of the designing army was not disclosed
 lekin is sach ke saamne aate hi puri duniya ab us sach ko jaanane ke liye betaab he jo is america marine ke seene main dafn he
 In front of the whole world, Robert o'neill has claimed that he is no longer afraid of anyone
 usne hi duniya ke sabase bade aatank ko maar giraaya tha
 The last person to see Laden in a house in Abbottabad, Pakistan was o Neil
 unhone kareeb se laden ke sir main teen goliyaan maari thim
 The US government had hid the identity of the commandos till now
 lekin apni tangahaali or sarkari andekhi kaa hawala dete hue commando robert o nil ne khud ek channel ko intervyuu dene kaa khulaasa kar diya he
 And according to the information revealed so far, 38-year-old Robert will be interviewing the world for the first time next week in an interview of two episodes of American TV channel Fox TV News
 sena se ritairement le chuke navy sil commando ke duniya ke saamne aane ke is faisle se america raksha mahakamen main acchhee khaasi halchal or bechaini he
 The Robert o Neil who ended the world's biggest terror, why is he telling the world all those things
 ye raaj bhi ab kareeb kareeb fash ho chukaa he
 The world has come to know that the hard-working army fighting against its condition is now weakening
 gauratlab he ki 2 may 2011 ko duniya ke most wonted tebrist osama bin laden kaa khaatmaa hua tha or iske saath hi das saal baad america ne 9 / 11 kaa badla liya tha
 In the biggest and dangerous operation so far, the US entered Pakistan and killed Osama
 sirf 38 minute ke oparation main osama-bin-laden khatm ho gaya
 But you will be surprised to know that the preparation of this 38 minutes was going on for 9 years
 1 april se dilli ke logon ko bijli ke bilon main koi raahat nahin milegi
 The subsidy on the electricity bill will end after 31 March
 sansad main paas hue lekhanudaan maangon main dilli main 31 march ke baad bijli par sabsidi dene kaa praavdhaan nahin kiya gaya he
 Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has said that he had proposed in the budget that electricity subsidy should be given by September, but the BJP and Congress bypassed it and got the budget passed in Parliament
 aam aadmi party ke netaa sanjay singh ne congress or bijepi par aarope madhte hue kaha ki in donon partiyon kii bijli companiyon se sathganth he, jisaki vajah se janata pareshaan he
 On the other hand, Delhi BJP President Harsh Vardhan says that Kejriwal's 49-day government has cheated the people
 congress netaa jepi agarwal ne kejariwal ko aade haathon lete hue kaha ki unhone sabhi upabhoktaaon ke bijli bill aadhe karne kii baat kahi thi, lekin baad main usamen kai sharten jodakar janata ke saath chal kiya he
 Parliament's approval was received on Friday for six months of the next financial year of Delhi for the Vote on Account of Rs 18,033 crore
 dilli main raashtrapati shashan ke maddenjar sansad main paarit is bajet main arvind kejariwal sarkaar dwaara ghoshit sabsidi kaa praavdhaan nahin kiya gaya he
 Both the Houses of Parliament passed the Delhi appropriation and Vote on Demand demands by voice
 ullekhneey he ki mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ke istipha dene se pehle dilli vidhansabha main 2014-15 ke liye bajet paarit nahin kiya ja sakaa
 After the resignation of Kejriwal, President's rule was imposed in Delhi, so the approval of Parliament was mandatory for the passage of both the said Bills
 vitt rajyamantri namo narayan meena ne upree sadan main yah vidheyak pesh karte hue kaha, dilli ke liye 2014-15 kaa bajet pesh kiya ja rahaa he, jisamen rajya sarkaar ke chah maah ke kharchon ko puraa karne ke liye lekhanudaan maanga gaya he
 Along with this, he also made it clear that no allocation has been made in the new budget for the subsidies announced by the Kejriwal government
 sutron ke mutabik dilli main abhi chuni hui sarkaar nahin he or yahaan raashtrapati shashan lagu he, isliye lekhanudaan paas karaane kaa arth sirf sarkari kaamon ko jari rakhane ke liye rakam kii nikasi karnaa he
 The right to give exemption in electricity or any other item belongs to the elected government, so only when a new government is formed in Delhi, it will decide whether subsidy facility will be given or not

 There are reports that BJP may make Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath a star campaigner in Gujarat, and take advantage of his popularity

 Yogi supporters even raised slogans of every har yogi in the entire state

 Mission 150+ in Gujarat It is worth mentioning that this time BJP has targeted to win more than 150 seats in 182 seats of Gujarat Assembly
 to vahiin saurashtra or kuccha kii 53 siton main se party kaa lakshya 40 se adhik siten jeetne kaa he, abhi yahaan bijepi ke paas 35 siten hai
 The day comes the news that the government and security agencies are trying their best to tighten the terrorists
 suraksha ke aise intjaam kiye ja rahe hai ki parinda bhi par nahin maar saktaa
 Nevertheless, there is a blast of terror in which the claims of government claims fly away
 ajtak ke sting oparation main ye ujagar hua ki kaise chand rupayon main agar koi aatankwaadi bhi chaahe to voter idi card or driving license banavaa saktaa he
 That is, terrorists can get license to kill due to government corruption
 har dhamaakaa hindustan kii chaati ko chalni kar jaataa he or in dhamaakon kii gard se nikalataa he un aatankwaadiyon kaa cheharaa, jinke jehan main gaddari or dimag main nafrat kaa barood bharaa hota he
 You must have recognized these faces well
 abu jindal, jo mumbai main hue 26-11 ke aatanki hamale kaa ek bada master mind he
 Muhammad Fasih, the Indian Mujahideen militant, is looking for the police of two states of India
 or ikbaal bhatkal, jo karachi main baithkar hindustan main aatank kii aag failaane vaale indian mujahidin ko oparate karata he
 The dreaded terrorist Abu Jindal is currently in Mumbai ats's custody, but his voter card is ready in Ghaziabad near Delhi
 mohammad fahis saudi arab kii jail main band he, lekin hindustan main uskaa bhi voter idi card or driving license taiyaar ho gaya or jo ikbaal bhatkal karachi main baitha he, uskaa bhi voter idi card ban gaya
 How did the voter identity card and driving license of the terrorists who are in Mumbai, Karachi and Saudi Arabia become ready? kaise sarkari baabuon or dallalon kii sathganth main in aatankwaadiyon ke mil rahaa he license tu kil
 How can these terrorists make fake passports with fake identity cards with real photos? kaise sarkari daftaron or transport offis main baithe afasaron-baabuon or baahar baithe dallalon kii mileebhagat se aatankwaadiyon ko mil saktaa he desh ke kisi bhi hisse main panaah
 The driving license made by Muhammad Fasih in a Saudi jail is the most dangerous weapon in the hands of the terrorists, not the gun or the bomb, but the governmental identity which encourages him to roam and blast in the country without fear
 dilli or bangalore main aatank kii aag lagane vaala aatankwaadi mohammad faseeh is vakt saudi arab kii jail main band he
 But knowing that the land will slip under your feet in Ghaziabad, adjacent to Delhi, his official identity has become from his name and photo
 ek dimag main aatank kaa barood phuta or puraa shahar dahal uthaa
 a finger pistol trigger tightened and a bullet fired
 khauf or dehshat kii aise trailor dene vaale aatankwaadi kaa naam he mohammad faseeh
 Yes, this is the same terrorist of Indian Mujahideen, Muhammad Faseeh, who is accused of plotting several bomb blasts in India
 jisko hindustan kii apil par interpol tak talash rahaa tha or interpol kii hi madad se jise saudi arab main giraftaar kiya gaya
 But can you imagine that the driving license of terrorist Mohammed Fasih arrested in Saudi Arabia got ready in India
 dilli, mumbai or karnataka ke gunahagaar kaa voter idi card sarkari baabuon ke dastakhat se taiyaar ho gaya
 So bitter and creepy answer to this inconvenient question will slide the ground under your feet
 hindustan kaa ye most wanted aatankwaadi saudi arab ke jail main band he or yahaan hindustan main desh kii rajdhani ke saaye main sthit gajiabad main uskaa voter ai card bhi ban gaya or driving license bhi
 Just wait for the officials and their signal, tie the money strip on the eyes of the brokers sitting outside the government office and then see how a terrorist sitting across the seven seas becomes a resident of Ghaziabad
 aatank ke kadave ghunt har roj pine vaale hindustan ko isi kadavi sachai se rubaru karaane ke liye aaj tak ne ek behad sikret under cover oparation ke zariye is racket ko benakaab karne kii koshish kii, taaki desh ke saamne is khatarnaak dhaandhlee ko laayaa ja sake
 Give money and get the license of anyone, Aaj Tak's team reached the RTO office in Ghaziabad to expose the selling trust and the nexus of the officer-broker
 yahaan sahi pahchaan par driving license banane ke liye web camera or on line system kaa bandobast he
 But how the whole system melts on the heat of hot pockets and how the terrorists get the license to kill, to test it, we reached to get the driving license with the photo of this arrested terrorist
 transport daftar ke baahar dallalon kii puri jamaat ikattha thi or vahaan ajtak kii team pahunchi ek dalal ke paas
 The broker was given a photo of this terrorist and immediately after filling the form, he reached the authorities without any investigation
 form jamaa karaane or photo khinchvaane ke baad, usne hamen duusare hi din larning license dene kii baat kahi
 The next day when we got the license, we were surprised how a terrorist's license was made without any investigation
 is license ko lekar ajtak kii team transport daftar ke un adhikariyon ke paas pahunchi jinke paas license banane or uski jaanch padtaal kaa jimmaa hota he
 The team first reached Regional Inspectors AK Singh and VK Verma
 darasal ye donon adhikari, e ke singh or ve ke verma kii jimmedaari he license ke form ko check karne kii
 These two officials decide that the important license of the government should not be issued with the wrong name and address
 yahi vajah he ki jab ajtak team ne donon ko ye bataaya ki license par lagi photo galat he lekin wo maanane ko taiyaar nahin the
 Inspector KP Singh was told that the photo in your record has been changed in this license
 yani artio ke web camere par photo kisi or ne khichvaai or license par photo faseeh mahmud kii laga di gai he
 The Aaj Tak team also met RTO officer VK Verma, who was photographed and verified with a web cam
 is par verma ne bhi afasaron-dallalon kii mileebhagat se chalane vaale gorakhdhandhe ko benakaab karne kii jagah wo khud ko sahi tehraane main hi jute rahe
 Now the question was not of the broker, but of the credibility of the Transport Office, whose walls have been licked by bribes
 isiilie jab ajtak ne mohammad faseeh ke driving lices ke veriphication kii baat uthaayi, to inspector sahab kaa jawaab golmol tha
 Seeing the matter being serious, the matter came to Narendra Sharma
 in janaab kaa kaam he driving license main lagi photo ko check karnaa
 But when the photo of terrorist Mohammad Faseeh was pasted on the form, then Sharma ji's eyes got cheated
 abu jindal ko bhi aasaani se mil gai sarkari pahchaan26-11 ke aatankwaadiyon ko mumbai kaa rasta dikhaane or apane desh par hamalaa karaane kaa gunahagaar he abu jindal
 That Jindal was very difficult in the hands of security agencies
 lekin us abu jindal kii pahchaan bhi badi aasaani se ek sarkari daftar se nikal gaya
 Yes, in the Ghaziabad, where Muhammad Fasih's voter card and driving license was made, the voter card with his photo was also prepared in the name of Abu Jindal
 dallalon or sarkari baabuon kii meharbaani se
 Will you believe that the voter ID card of this terrorist who distributes death to innocents can be easily created
 wo bhi bahut dur nahin, balki desh kii rajdhani dilli se sate gajiabad main hi ye mumkin he, wo bhi sarkari daftar se
 If you go by the rules and laws, there will be a lot of hurdles in getting your voter ID card, but if you heat the pockets of government babus and brokers outside government offices, then a terrorist like Abu Jindal will also become a voter ID card
 abu jindal kii tasviir sahi he, uskaa naam sahi he, lekin uske naam or tasviir par ye nakli voter card ban gaya
 From where the Aaj Tak team got the terrorists' voter cards and driving licenses, the police was also present there
 lekin khuli ankhon se bhi kuch bhi nahin dekhne vaali
 After all, every broker gets 300-300 rupees in the pocket of these policemen
 ye baat khud ye dalal ne kahi
 You can get a driving license in the name of someone by paying money in Noida adjacent to Delhi
 agar kagaz adhure he to 1500 rupye or agar puraa he nakli pataa chahie to 3000 rate he
 Andhergardi is even more outside Noida and Delhi
 aapako RTO offis jane kii zarurat hi nahin
 Give money and take government license
 kamobesh yahi haal dilli se sate faridabad kaa he jahaan dalal 3500 rupee main license banavaane kaa theka lete hai
 In search of terrorists, many times the police files are closed and this is because through this fake identity, all the terrorists from IM to Lashkar are roaming in disguise in the country
 haath main lekar license tu kil
 This is the same situation in other areas of UP, this nefarious nexus between the officials and babus is not only going on in Ghaziabad but also in other areas of Uttar Pradesh
 or iskaa sabase bada saboot he indian mujahiddeen ke sargana aatankwaadi ikbaal bhatkal kaa voter card or driving license ban janaa
 Iqbal Bhatkal is sitting in Karachi, but before his photo and name became fake voter ID card and then license
 ab is par adhikariyon se safai dete nahin ban rahaa he
 The police of the country and the world are looking for Iqbal Bhatkal
 intelligence report ke mutabik, ikbaal bhatkal ek arase se karachi main chupa hua he
 But the question is, can a voter ID card be made in the name of such a terrorist? Such a terrorist can get a driving license? But this important government document was prepared on the name and picture of this absconding terrorist of India and that too in this month
 mohammad faseeh or abu jindal jaise aatankwaadiyon ke baad ajtak kii team ne sochaa ki kya inke sargana ikbaal bhatkal kaa bhi driving license or voter idi card ban saktaa he
 And can it also be built outside ghaziabad-noida
 ise parakhane ke liye ajtak kii team uttar pradesh ke muradabad pahunchi, jahaan pataa chalaa ki madani namka ek shaks driving license or voter idi card banavaane kaa kaam karata he
 We bumped into Madani directly and showed him a photo of Iqbal Bhatkal and asked if he could get a driving license in this person's name within 24 hours
 madani ne chand ghanton main hi hamen pehle to karachi main baithe ikbaal bhatkal kaa voter idi card muradabad main de diya
 But for the driving license he said that he will get it made from some other district
 agle hi din madani ke kehane par muradabad ke paas hi ek dukaan par ham pahunche, jahaan ek ladke ne ikbaal bhatkal kaa heavi vehical chalaane kaa driving license hamen de diya
 On getting the license, we noticed that both the seal and the license have been issued from the Transport Office of Shikohabad
 lekin jab shikohabad ke artio se poocha gaya to unka kahana tha, 'jis siries kaa ye he, wo hamaare yahaan kaa nahin he
 'even though Iqbal Bhatkal's series does not match the RTO register of Shikohabad, but the license and the card itself tell us that there is a big mess
 or is khabar par uttar pradesh sarkaar bhi maan rahi he ki system main gadabad to jarur he
 The Transport Minister of the state believes that in the next one year, he will make full arrangements so that the official identity of any dreaded terrorist is not made
