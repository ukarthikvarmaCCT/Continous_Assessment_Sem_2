 Take advice - Before making your career in any field, talk to the experts associated with that field
 pehle to aap apane intrest ke hisaab se college, course chunane ke liye kansaltent se baat karen or uske baad kariyar kaa chunaav karen

 Therefore, do not let anyone's suggestions come into effect when you are choosing a career option

 Keep in mind the future - if you choose a career option that does not have a future, then you may face a problem
 isliye, upyukt kariyar vikalp ke mahatvapurn pahaluon kaa dhyaan rakhen

 Now this community has expectations from the politics of Narendra Modi taking everyone along
 ’unhone vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi kii ore se ek bhi muslim ummidavaar nahin utaarne kaa bhi bachaav kiya or kaha ki party pehle is chunaav main teen muslim ummidavaaron ko utaarna chaahati thi lekin keshubhai patel kii gujarat parivartan party (jipipi) ke sakriy hone ke baad is par dobaaraa vichaar kiya gaya
 'kesodwala said,' Actually due to stable law and order, the Muslims of the state are getting equal opportunity to move forward and their business is also on the path of progress without any hindrance
 ’gujarat main bijepi kaa nayaa muslim cheharaa asifa khan ne bhi is baat kii tasadeeq kii
 He said, 'the Muslim people of Gujarat have reacted to Modi ji's politics of taking everyone along and they are now going ahead of the events of 2002 and voting for BJP

 Punjab cabinet minister and Congress leader Navjot Singh Sidhu has once again praised Pakistan
 is baar siddhu kaa pakistan prem himachal pradesh ke kasauli main chal rahe litarechar festival ke dauraan dekhne ko mila
 During the discussion in the first session of Kasauli Literature Festival, Navjot Singh Sidhu termed his visit to Pakistan better than his visit to South India
 congress netaa navjot singh siddhu ne kaha ki aapapakistanmen kahin bhi yatra kar lo, vahaan na to bhashaa badalati he, na hi khaanaa badalata or na hi log badalte hai, jabaki dakshin bharat main jane par bhashaa se lekar khanpan tak sab kuch badal jaataa he
 You have to learn English or Telugu to live in South India, but this is not necessary in Pakistan
 siddhu ke is pakistan prem ko lekar ek baar phir se vivaad paidaa ho saktaa he
 Earlier, Sidhu had gone to Pakistan to attend the swearing-in ceremony of Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan and hugged Army Chief Qamar Javed Bajwa
 is dauraan siddhu ne bajva or pakistan kii tarif main jamkar kaside bhi padhe the
 At a press conference in Islamabad, Sidhu said, 'I brought a love message from India, i am taking back 100 times more love than the love i had brought
 pakistan se jo waapas aayaa he, wo sood samed aayaa he
 On getting a hug from the Pakistani Army Chief, Sidhu had said, "general Bajwa Sahab hugged me and said - we want peace
" bajva ne kaha ki ham log guru nanak dev kii 550veen jayanti par kartarpur root kholane par vichaar kar rahe hai
 'there was a lot of ruckus about this and many political parties including BJP demonstrated against Sidhu
 sthaayee kochon kii niyukti ke mudde par alag-alag rangala tii-20 vishwa cap agle saal australia membhartiya mahila cricket team ne 2018 main tii-20 world cap main semifinal tak kaa safar kiya
 These teams with blue kits want to improve their performance
 isliye wo vyavasthit or samarpit saport staff chaahati he
 This issue was complicated by the BCCI Committee of Administrators (COA) meeting
 aglaa tii-20 vishwa cap agle saal farvari main australia main hone vaala he
 According to sources different opinions have come out among the stakeholders regarding the support staff of the women's team
 mahila cricket team ke head coach dablyuvi raman kii madad ke liye sthaayee bowling coach or fielding coach kii upyogita ko lekar alag mat ubhare hai
 Currently former leg-spinner and a coach of the National Cricket Academy (NCA), Narendra Hirwani plays the part-time spin consultant for the Indian women's team
 dakshin africa ke saath chal rahi gharelu siries main hirwani isi bhoomika main hai
 The Indian team has many spinners including Poonam Yadav, Ekta Bisht, Deepti Sharma
 'mahila team ke liye bhi saport staff kii phixd niyuktiyaan hon'baithak main sioe sadsy or purv captain dyna adulji ne mahila team ke saath parttime asinament ke liye ensie kochon ko laane ke vichaar par asahmati jataai
 The source told India Today, Diana Edulji told NCA director Rahul Dravid and general manager Saba Karim at the meeting that like men's cricket, there should be fixed appointments of support staff for the women's team
 dakshin africa ke khilaaf team kii sahaayta ke liye jis tarah se hirwani ko depute kiya gaya, usee tarah se bharat ke U19 or e tiimon ke coach paras mahambre ko fast bowling coach ke taur par mahila team ke saath bhejne par bhi vichaar kiya ja rahaa he
 West Indies will have a series of three odis and five T20 matches next month
 sutara ne bataaya, 'rahul dravid ne adulji se kaha ki ve ensie kochon ko keval mahilaon kii cricket ko laabh pahunchane ke liye uplabdh kara rahe the
 Edulji also took a different view of being sent to Biju George in the West Indies for part-time fielding coaches
 biju jorge kaa contract is maheene khatm ho rahaa he
 Edulji also questioned why the appointment of a full-time analyst for the women's team could not be done even after the advertisement was released
 baithak main phul time niyuktiyon ke liye tark rakhe gaesutra ne bataaya, ‘sioe sadsy adulji ne captain or coach ke saath baat karne ke baad phul time niyuktiyon ke liye apane tark rakhe
 He also emphasized on the process of advertisement and interview for these appointments
 ’bataaya gaya he ki sioe chairman vinod raay ne prakriya ko shuru karne or ek hafte ke samay main hi niyuktiyaan kii jaaengi
 The demand for the appointment of a sports psychologist on behalf of some senior players of the women's team seems far-fetched after a different opinion about full-time support staff appointments
 ye mudda baithak main vichaar tak ke liye saamne nahin aayaa

 On the Batla House encounter, where the BJP is engaged in besieging the Congress, there is a ruckus within the Congress itself
 digvijay singh jahaan ise farzi bataane par ade hue hai vahiin shivaraj patil ne ise asli qaraar diya he
 Shivraj Patil, who was the Home Minister during the 2008 Batla House encounter, has made it clear that the encounter was real and there is no scope for doubt
 batla house se bhaage aatankwaadi abu raashid kaa cheharaa iesas ke video main aane ke baad bijepi ne digvijay singh se maafi maangane kii maang kii he
 But Digvijay Singh is still firm on his stand of not only calling the Batla encounter a fake but also insisting on a judicial inquiry
 party ke bheetar kii in do awaazon par congress kii faziihat ho rahi he
 Though the party has been separating itself from Digvijay's stubbornness, but it has to be sustained
 congress ke media pramukh randeep surajevaala kaa kahana he, 'us samay kii sarkaar ne tathyon ke aadhaar ek faisalaa liya jis par court or rashtriya maanavadhikaar ayog (NHRC) donon ne muhar lagaayi thi
 We respect Digvijay Singh, he may have a different feeling
 ' tippaniyan p Chidambaram, who became the Home Minister after Shivraj, has also told the Batla encounter right but Digvijay still continues his different raga
 batla house ke mudde par digvijay singh hameshaa party line se baahar jaakar baat karte rahe hai lekin phir bhi party main unki jagah ko koi nuksaan nahin pahunchataa
 There is doubt whether they do this only on the instigation of the party or whether they do not trust their UPA government
 2008 main hue batla house encounter ke vaqt grahamantri rahe shivaraj patil ne saafe kar diya he ki encounter asli tha or isamen shaq kii koi gunjaaish nahin
 The BJP has demanded an apology from Digvijay Singh after the face of terrorist Abu Rashid who ran from Batla House appeared in the ISIS video
 lekin digvijay singh abhi bhi batla encounter ko na sirf farzi bataane ke apane rukh par qaayam hai balki nyaayik jaanch kii maang par bhi ade hai
 These two voices within the party are troubling the Congress
 haalanki party khud ko digvijay kii zid se alag karti rahi he lekin sanbhal kar
 Congress media head Randeep Surjewala says, "the government at that time took a decision based on the facts which were approved by both the court and the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC)
" digvijay singh kaa ham sammaan karte hai, unki alag bhaavana ho sakati he
 Comments shivaraj ke baad grahamantri bane pi chidambaram bhi batla encounter ko sahi bataa chuke hai lekin digvijay phir bhi apana alag raag alaapte rahe hai
 Digvijay Singh has always been talking outside the party line on the issue of Batla House but still his place in the party is not harmed
 yaheen shaq hota he ki kya party kii andruni shah par hi ve aisa karte hai yaa phir wo apni upie sarkaar par hi bharosa nahin jataa rahe

 do din pehle hamane 'vaardaat' main aapako bataaya tha ki uttar korea ke taanashaah marshall kim jong-un ke china jane kii khabar he
 That too by train
 ab 24 ghante baad china or uttar korea ne baqayada video or tasviren jari kar marshall ke china daure kii tasdik kar di he
 According to reports, Marshal Kim Jong was in China's capital Beijing for those three days
 magar marshall ke china daure kii aisi pardadari thi ki khulaasa tab hua, jab wo waapas uttar korea pahunch gaye
 The warmth between those two leaders is telling that the whole excavation is on one side and the brother of China on one side
 mumkin he ye tasviren hairaan karen
 But this whole world is astonishing as well
 khaskar america ko paigaam de rahi hai ki saadhe paanch feet ke is marshall par dragon kaa haath or donon saath hai
 And as long as China is there, no child of North Korea will be able to stop
 in tasveeron ke kai myne hai, jinako samajhnaa duniya ke liye bhi or donald trump ke liye bhi zaruri he
 But before that, during his 7-year tenure, understand Kim's first meeting with a Head of State very carefully how important this meeting was to Kim
 beijing ke dayutai state guest house main donon netaaon kii ye mulaakaat hui
 It is said that the Chinese President meets the guests who are very special for China
 or yaheen shi jinping ne uttar korea se apane dost kaa red carpet welcome kiya
 However, after reaching Beijing by his special train, Kim Jong-un first went to the Great Hall of the People
 jahaan unka chini raashtrapati ne swaagat kiya or phir unhen guard of honor diya gaya
 During this, the two leaders stood together on the podium
 jahaan chini raashtrapati kii bivi ke saath-saath kim kii bivi ri sol ju bhi maujuud thim
 During the reception that lasted about half an hour, the two leaders were very close
 shi jingping ke bhaashan ke baad kim ne apane bhaashan main china ko bharosa dilaayaa ki wo apane mulk ke parmaanu prasar ko rokenge
 The relationship between the two countries was tensed for a long time due to China's support for international sanctions against them during North Korea's nuclear program
 jisamen sudhaar laane ke iraade se kim jong un ne apane kaarykaal ke dauraan pehali videsh yatra kii
 China has always been a partner of North Korea and at a time when America's interference is increasing in Korean peninsula
 kim ke liye kisi bhi haal main china kaa saath zaruri tha
 According to China's official news agency Xinhua, talks between the two leaders were highly successful
 dakshin korea or america ke saath may ke maheene main hone vaali baatcheet se pehle kim jong-un kaa ye daura kaaphi ahm mana ja rahaa he
 In return for promising to stop its nuclear proliferation, China has also promised to strengthen ties with North Korea
 ye usee kamyaabi baatcheet kaa nateeja he ki shi jingping unhen dayutai state guest house bhi le gaye
 Where both the leaders gave their opinion on the current situation
 itnaa hi nahin jingping mulaakaat ke baad kim jong un or unki bivi ko unki car tak chhodane bhi aae
 After this, Kim Jong Un also went to see the fair of the Chinese Academy of Sciences
 jahaan unhen chini vaigyanikon ne nae avishkaron ke bare main bataaya
 According to the Chinese agency, after this, North Korean Marshal Kim Jong-un with his clan left the country in the same green train
 loksabhaa main paas hua naagarikta sanshodhan billjadayu main bill ke samarthan par alag-alag raiprashanth kishor ke baad ab pawan verma ne kiya virodhloksabhaa main naagarikta sanshodhan bill paas ho gaya he or bihar main endie main saathi janata dal (you) ne is bill kaa samarthan kiya he
 But on this decision, JDU seems to be torn apart
 party ke upaadhyaksh prashanth kishor ke baad ab pawan verma ne bhi is bill kaa virodh kiya he or nitish kumaar se faisle par punarvichaar karne ko kaha he
 JDU spokesman Pawan Kumar Verma tweeted about this on Tuesday
 unhone likhaa, ‘main nitish kumaar se apil karata hum ki rajyasabha main naagarikta sanshodhan bill (CAB) par samarthan par dobaaraa vichaar karen
 This bill is completely unconstitutional and is against the unity of the country
 ye bill jadyu ke mul vichaaron ke bhi khilaaf hai, gandhi ji iskaa puri tarah se virodh karte’
 i urge Shri Nitish Kumar to reconsider support to the # cabin the Rajya Sabha
 The Bill is unconstitutional, discriminatory, and against the unity and harmony of the country, apart from being against the secular principles of the JDU
 Gandhiji would have strongly disapproved it
 — Pavan K
 Varma (@pavank_varma) December 10, 2019 It is worth mentioning that JDU supported the Citizenship Amendment Bill in the Lok Sabha
 loksabhaa main jadyu ke kul 16 saansad hai
 While JDU has a total of 6 mps in Rajya Sabha
 prashanth kishor ne bhi kiya tha virothpawan verma se pehlejadayu ke upaadhyaksh or raajnneeti ranneetikaar prashanth kishorane twit kar is bill kaa virodh kiya tha
 Prashant Kishore tweeted that "it is very disappointing for JDU to support the Citizenship Amendment Bill"
 jadyu kaa is maamle main samarthan karnaa party ke samvidhan kaa bhi ulanghan karata he or ye gandhi ke vichaaron ke khilaaf he
 'disappointed to see JDU supporting # cabthat discriminates right of citizenship on the basis of religion
 It's incongruous with the party's constitution that carries the word secular thrice on the very first page and the leadership that is supposedly guided by Gandhian ideals
 - Prashant Kishor (@prashantkishor) December 9, 2019 Let us know that the Citizenship Amendment Bill has passed by a large majority in the Lok Sabha, but the bill is yet to pass in Rajya Sabha
 rajyasabha main ye bill buudhvaar ko pesh hoga, isapar bahes ke liye 6 ghante kaa samay alot kiya gaya he
 According to this bill, Hindu, Jain, Buddhist, Christian, Sikh and Parsi citizens coming from pakistan-afghanistan-bangladesh will be able to get citizenship in India
 vipaksh is bill kaa virodh kar rahaa he or ise bharat ke samvidhan ke khilaaf bataa rahaa he
 The bill passed in the Lok Sabha in the ratio of 311-80
 modi sarkaar ne loksabhaa main teen talaak ke khilaaf bill ko pesh kar diya he
 When Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad introduced the bill on Thursday, several opposition parties including RJD, BJD opposed the provision of punishment in the bill
 lekin sadan main sabase badi vipakshi party congress is mudde par sarkaar ke saath he
 Congress will not oppose the triple talaq bill, nor bring any amendment
 congress kii ore se sirf teen suzav die jaaengecongress pravaktaa randeep surajevaala ne kaha ki party teen talaak bill kaa samarthan karegi, haalanki kuch suzav sarkaar ke saamne jarur rakhe jaaenge
 These two big suggestions can be made by the Congress
 1
 After the divorce, how much allowance will be given to the Muslim woman, how much of the wife's share of the husband's income
 iskaa formula kya hoga
 2
 agar pati teen saal ke liye jail jayega, to patni ko bhatta kis prakaar milegaa
 If sources are to be believed, Congressmen, led by party president Rahul Gandhi, met late last night on this issue
 sutron ke mutabik baithak main teen talaak bill ke paksh main congress dikhi thi
 In such a situation, it is possible that the central government should have no problem in passing this bill
 randeep surajevaala ne kaha ki congress ne teen talaak yaa talaak-e-biddat ke mudde ko hameshaa is maapdand par aanka he ki mahila adhikaron kii suraksha ho or mahilaon kii barabari samvidhan sarvamatti tareeke se ho
 He said that Congress had welcomed the decision of the Supreme Court regarding triple talaq
 unhone kaha ki congress teen talaak ko pratibandhit karne vaale kanoon kaa samarthan karti he
 We believe that this law needs to be strengthened according to the opinion of women's organizations and Muslim organizations
 mahila congress kii adhyaksh sushmita dev ne kaha ki prastaavit vidheyak main muslim mahila ko guzaara bhatta dene kii baat kahi gai he
 But the method of determination of maintenance has not been explained, the government should explain this
 sushmita ne kaha ki 1986 ke muslim mahila sambandhi ek kanoon ke tahat talaak paane vaali mahilaon ko guzaara bhatta mil rahaa he
 Nowhere should they stop getting this alimony due to the new law
 ovaisi samet kuch vipakshi partiyon ne kiya virodhloksabhaa main jab bill pesh hua to rajd, bijedi samet kuch vipakshi partiyon ne sajaa ke praavdhaan kaa virodh kiya
 AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi also opposed the bill
 unhone kaha ki ye bill samvidhan ke mutabik nahin he
 Owaisi said that divorce is illegal, law on domestic violence already exists, then what is the need for another similar law? How will the bill? Significantly, the government 'the Muslim Women Protection of Rights in Marriage Act' Is bringing this bill by name
 ye kanoon sirf teen talaak (INSTANT TALAQ, yani talaak-e-biddat) par hi lagu hoga
 After this law, if any Muslim husband gives three divorces to the wife, then it will be illegal
 iske baad se kisi bhi swaroop main diya gaya teen talaak vah chahen maukhik ho, likhit or yaa massej main, vah avaidh hoga
 Anyone who divorces three can be punished and fined for three years
 yani teen talaak dena gaiyr-jamaanti or sangyeya ( Cognizable) aparaadh hoga
 In this the magistrate will decide how much penalty will be there
 piem narendra modi ne teen talaak par kanoon banane ke liye ek mantri samooh banaaya tha, jisamen rajnath singh, arun jetali, sushamaa swaraj, ravishankar prasad, peepi choudhary or jitendra singh shaamil the

 Although Australia looked in good shape till the score of 118 for one wicket, Chawla's spell broke the middle order badly

 Virender Sehwag scored the highest 54 runs for which he played 56 balls
 usuf pathanko bhi khulkar khilne ke liye kuch samay krij par bitaana padaa
 He scored 32 off 39 balls which included two sixes

 He scored only one run off seven balls before being caught by wicketkeeper Tim Paine on Johnson's bouncer

 Captain Dhoni could not do justice to his fame and returned to the pavilion playing Hastings' ball on his wicket
 isse score chaar wicket par 101 ran ho gaya
 Although Sehwag adopted an aggressive approach against Krejza, he was eventually dismissed by this off-spinner
 unhone kreja kii gend par chakka jadkar apana ardhashatak puraa kiya lekin agali gend par hi is aaf spinner kii gend unke balle kaa kinaaraa lekar viketon main samaa gayi
 Sehwag hit eight fours and a six in his innings

 Sunil Gavaskar has brought three books of Rupa Publication as a storybook
 isamen gavaskar kii teen lokapriy kitaaben ‘sani days’, ‘idles’ or ‘van de vanders’ shaamil kii gai hai
 Where the pages of Sunny Days, Pargavaskar has engraved his entire cricket career since childhood
 vahiin ‘idles’ ko unhone duniya bhar ke 31 apane samakaleen cricketron ko samarpit kiya he
 So 'one Day Wonders' is a wonderful collection of Team India's most memorable One Day wins
 sanni desis kitaab kii yah khaasiyat he ki ye sirf cricket ke maidan se judi ghatnaon kaa sankalan na ho kar unke jivan se jude kai pahaluon ko bayaan karti he
 On its front page, Gavaskar has mentioned the most bizarre incident of his life
 yah ghatana unke janm se judi he
 Gavaskar changed from a mother's child to a fisherman's mother the very next day of birth due to hospital staff
 gavaskar ne is ghatana par aage likhaa ki kya hota agar wo tab waapas nahin mili hote!haalanki apane cover drive kii timming ke liye jane jane vaale gavaskar kii is kitaab ke prakaashan ke maamle main thode kacch rah gaye
 When this book was published, he was on the threshold of matching the record of 29 centuries of Sir Don Bradman
 westeindies ke khilaaf agali siries kheli jaani thi or isi dauraan unhone na keval apni sarvshereshth test pari (naabad 236 ran) khelte hue isaki barabari kii balki agle hi test main is record ko tod bhi daalaa
 He scored 50 in 6 Tests of this series
 50 kii ausat se 505 ran banaae
 Due to his great performance in the series, his book sales increased tremendously
 cricket kii hi tarah gavaskar lekhan kala main bhi bahut nipun hai yah unhone apni is pehali kitaab aatmakatha sani days main bakhubi bataa diya
 Idols Inspired by the success of the first book Sunny Days, he wrote the next book 'idols'
 naam ke anusaar gavaskar ne isamen taatkaalik behtareen cricketron kaa vyaktigat aankalan kiya
 Each chapter of this book is dedicated to a cricketer
 isamen england se jyoff bycott, derek underwood, ellen note, ian botham or jon snow shaamil kiye gaye hai
 Denis Lillee, Geoff Thomson, Rodney Marsh and Chappell brothers from Australia have been replaced
 pakistan se jahir abbaas, javed miyandad, asif ikbaal or imran khan hai
 While there are cricketers from the West Indies like Sir Gary Sobers, Rohan Kanhai, Andy Roberts and Clive Lloyd
 yahaan yah baat hairaan karne vaali he ki jahaan videshi tiimon se antarrashtriya khilaadiyon ko unhone jagah di vahiin jin 10 bhartiya cricketron ko unhone apni is kitaab main rakhaa unamem se keval aath hi test match khel sake
 Eight test players along with spin trio Bedi, Prasanna and Venkataraghavan, along with their brothers-in-law Gundappa Vishwanath, Kapil Dev, Mohinder Amarnath and Sayyed Kirmani, could make a place in their iconic book
 jabaki kitaab main shaamil aashcharyachakit karne vaale do cricketer bombai ke padmakar shivalkar or haryana ke rajindra goyal he
 By the way, there was nothing new in the content of this book
 yani jo kuch bhi likhaa gaya usamen cricket kii duniya ko hilaa kar rakh dene kii kshamta nahin thi
 Gavaskar has praised every player included in this book both as a person and as a cricketer
 haalanki is kitaab main unhone apane cricket jivan ke sabase vivaadaaspad ghatana kaa bhi zikr kiya he
 This incident is of the Melbourne Test played in 1980 when he left the field against Australia
 gavaskar ne kitaab main is puri ghatana kaa zikr kiya
 He writes, 'when the umpire did not reverse the decision to give me out on Lily's ball, i got very angry because the ball hit the pad after taking the inner edge of my bat
 ’ unhone aage likhaa, ‘jab main chetan (chouhan) ke paas se guzar rahaa tha tab maine lily ko unke ek apshabd kehete suna
 Hearing this, i lost my temper and brought Chetan out of the ground with me
 ’haalanki gavaskar ne yah sweekaar kiya, ‘yah unke jivan kii sabase afsosjanak ghatana thi
 Today i feel that there was no exact reason for my behavior then and as a player and captain of the team i should not have done so
 ’van de vanderssunil gavaskar kii yah kitaab australia main kheli gai benson hejes siries ke dauraan field ection ke saath hi is dauraan hui vibhinn ghatnaon kaa behtareen sankalan he
 Gavaskar has written this book in such a way that you will be forced to read it again and again
 ise padhanaa shuru karne ke saath hi saath hi aap isamen kho jaaenge
 Those who have seen Gavaskar playing cricket or have watched his videos on the Internet to date, while reading this book, they will definitely feel that Team India is playing in front of their eyes
 gavaskar ne is kitaab main is baat kaa zikr kiya he ki kaise hamaare desh main custom department videshi cricketron ko variyata detii he or unke passporce pehle check kiye jate hai jabaki bhartiya team ke khilaadiyon ko videshon main intjaar karnaa padataa he
 Gavaskar has also included many fun moments in it
 unhone daure par wicketiper sadanand vishwanath kaise chiz ko cellophane raper ke saath hi kha lete the iskaa bahut hi shandaar varnan kiya he
 Another fun incident is the match that was played against New Zealand
 is match main slog overs ke dauraan newjiland ke batsman bruce blair ne ball ko bahut ooncha de maaraa, shrikant ne us aasaan kaich ko drop kar diya
 On the next ball, Bruce again caught the catch, the ball again went to Srikanth but Srikanth missed this time too
 tab captain gavaskar ne gusse main shrikant ko maidan ke duusare sire par bhej diya
 Right on the next ball again Bruce hit the ball again and the ball again reached Srikanth but this time did not miss
 is kitaab main sharajah main kheli gai 1985 champions trophy ke us final match kaa bhi zikr he jisamen imran khan ke 14 ranon par 6 wicket kii badaulat team india 126 par ol out ho gai thi or fielding karne ke liye utarate samay captain kapil dev ne kaha, ‘chalon unhen ladane ke liye majaboor karen
 After this, Team India dismissed the entire Pakistani team for 87 runs
 is kitaab aaj bhi cricket ke chaahane waalon ke bich bahumoolya dharohar ke rup main lokapriy he
 i highly recommend it to all cricket followers to read 'how to play with team spirit'

 The number one position is at stake in India's ICC Test Championship
" england main hamane is shrinkhalaa main ab tak behad kadaa or manoranjak cricket dekha he

 The new Test Championship will see better competition and it will strengthen our great game

 Against the backdrop of the Ram temple controversy, the Centre's move is drawing many reactions
 jahaan rashtriya swayamsevak sangh or vishwa hindu parishad ne is sarkaar ke is kadam kaa swaagat kiya he
 So at the same time, Swami Avimukteshwarananda, a representative of Shankaracharya Swami Swaroopananda of Dwarkapith in Dharmasansad in Ardh Kumbh of Prayagraj, has said to try to deviate from this issue
 dharmacharya avimukteshwaranand ne ram mandir masale par centre sarkaar ke is kadam par naaraazgi jataate hue kaha ki sarkaar chhalane kii koshish kar rahi he

 On January 30, the Ram temple issue will be discussed throughout the day in Dharmasand, in which there will be a detailed discussion on this issue

 The government has taken this step in the Ram temple case when there was a proposal to criticize the government for not taking appropriate steps regarding the temple on the first day of the three-day Dharmasandas convened by Shankaracharya Swami Swaroopananda in Prayagraj
 vahiin, 30-31 janvari ko prayagraj main hi viechpi kii aguwai main ek or dharmasansad honi he
 In such a situation, the Central Government has definitely given an issue to the Sant Samaj before the discussion in Ram Dharma Sansad
 centre sarkaar ne supreme court main daayar yachika main kaha he ki is maamle main mahaj 0
 There is a dispute over 313 acres of land, so there is no need to maintain the status quo on the rest of the land acquired by the government
 isliye vivaadit sthal ke aasapaas kii adhigrahit jameen maamle se jude pakshakaron ko waapas kar di jaani chahie
 Significantly, after the Babri demolition, the then Narasimha Rao government had acquired the disputed site and surrounding land by bringing an ordinance in 1993
 vahiin, elahabaad hai court ne 2010 ke apane faisle main ayodhya main vivaadit 2

 After this, the ownership of the land was challenged in the Supreme Court's decision of the Laker Allahabad High Court

 phir ek din un donon par najar padati he sports academy ke guru ram prasad lakshmana kii
 He brings both of them to the academy from the village
 yahaan kiran to apni badali hui jindagi main ramate hue kadi mehnat karne lagati he
 But Sanjay's focus is on Kiran instead of track and field
 use kiran kaa samir naam ke ladke se dosti karnaa raas nahin aata
 As a result, all the Jatans prove to be useless and he turns from runner to Devdas
 udhar kiran ko sports academy kii ek ghinauni hakeekat se do chaar hona padataa he
 After stumbling and then getting help from Guru Ram Prasad, they both recover and start galloping towards their dreams
 magar abhi doping main funsane or khel prashasan kii laal fitaashahee se paar paane jaisi baadhaaen bhi baaki hai unke raste main
 How do these two overcome them, can they even do it or not, does their dream come true
 isi sab ko film main dikhaane kii koshish kii gai he
 In the film's story, there is no attempt to fine tune the details
 na to sports ke seen main koi romaanch he or na hi athleates kii bhitari kii duniya dikhaane main koi salika
 Everything feels very fake
 lead kirdaar main navdeep singh or simer kii acting bhi prabhavit nahin kar paati
 One, both the characters are written in a flat manner, on which their acting gives a dung leap
 coach ke role main bajrang bali singh bhi theatre ke lod se laden najar aate hai
 Nafisa Ali arrives for a while and the film gets a little smoother
 diarector jaid ali betarah niraash karte hai
 If you would have seen a good sports film made in the country and worked hard on the story, we would not have been disappointed
 film kaa mujeec bharwaan he or cinemetography bhi ausat
 Overall, this film is less than average
 athleates kii jindagi dikhaane ke naam par jabaran gyaan pilaane kii koshish bhar rah jaati he khwab

 ) There are elections in 59 states in the 7th phase in many states of the country, but the election of 9 seats in Bengal seems to be the biggest battle
 yahaan trinmul congress or bijepi ek duusare ke aamane saamne aa gaye hai
 In its first such decision, the Election Commission on Wednesday halted the election campaign 20 hours ahead of schedule following the violence at Amit Shah's roadshow on Tuesday
 is faisle ke baad jahaan mamata banerjee saaf kah rahi hai ki chunaav ayog modi or shah ke ishaare par kaam kar rahaa he to duusari ore bijepi bhi mamata banerjee par hamalavar he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has accused Mamata Banerjee of endangering democracy, while Mamata Banerjee is saying that if needed, she will put Modi in jail
 chunaav ayog par pakshpaat ke aaropon ko lekar mamata banerjee ko congress or left samet kai vipakshi dalon kaa saath mila he, haalanki yahaan ye jaananaa jaruri he ki dipti ellection kamishnar or special objarvars ne bengal par jo report di thi usamen saaf kaha gaya he ki police-prashasan sabhi ummidavaaron ko samaan avasar nahin de rahaa he, saath hi tiemasi ke netaa 23 may ke baad kii dhamkee logon ko de rahe hai
 Aaj Tak spoke to CPM leader Brinda Karat and BJP leader Roopa Ganguly on the Election Commission action
 roopa ganguli ne kaha ki unki party bijepi par is baat ke liye kaaphi naaraaz he ki aisa kadaa kadam itani deree se kyon uthaaya gaya
 Why the Para Military Force of the entire country was not raised and deployed in Bengal where there is so much violence
 roopa ganguli ne kaha ki mamata banerjee kaa chunaav prachaar bain karnaa chahie tha kyonki ve bhaashanon main gaali galoj kar rahi hai
 Ganguly said that the entire 7th phase should be closed as it is necessary to find out the reasons for the violence first
 roopa ganguli ke mutabik vidyasagar college main jab chaatr pehle se kaale jhande dikhaa rahe the, binar laga rahe the to police ko isaki jaankaree kyon nahin thi, isaki jaanch honi chahie
 What people outside know that there are three gates inside the college and behind it is a statue of Vidyasagar
 college main sipiem, tiemasi or congress ke hi ladke honge jo ye kaam (murti todna) karenge
 Vrinda Karat said about the decision of the Election Commission that the Election Commission should have abided by the law
 pradhanmantri narendra modi kii teenon raily khatm hone ke baad buudhvaar raat 10 baje se pabandi lagaai ja rahi he, ye pakshpaat nahin he to kya he? is faisle se chunaav ayog kii vishwasaneeyata ghatati he, badhati he yaa bachati he, ye bada sawaal he
 Karat said that in the case of Election Commission we are not with any party but with rules and law
 mamata banerjee koun hoti hai chunaav ayog ko bolne vaaleen kyonki unhone khud kai niyamon ko todaa he
 The role that the Election Commission should have played is not at all
 chunaav ayog puri tarah pakshpaat main kaam kar rahaa he
 Vrinda Karat said, it is the responsibility of the Election Commission to decide what kind of processions can go out, what kind of slogans can be raised
 chunaav ayog ke vishesh photographer or videographer hote hai
 It has a special responsibility that whatever the official video is, it should be brought before the whole country
 us aadhaar par pataa chalegaa ki bijepi or aresas ke logon ne kya kiya or tiemasi ke logon ne kya kiya
 It is the responsibility of the Election Commission to do milk and water of milk
 chunaav ayog kii karrwai par roopa ganguli ne kaha ki sabase zyada ghaataa bijepi ko he kyonki use 24 ghante prachaar se dur rahanaa padegaa
 The Election Commission has not been able to handle the election of Bengal

 team india ke test captain viraat kohli ke prashansakon main ek or bada naam jud gaya he
 The man has been a 15-time world champion in wrestling and has become a part of the 'smackdown' TV show these days and will be the face of it
 ji haa, raceling champion jon seenaa ne kohli kii ek tasviir apane fasebuk or instagram pej par post kii he, jisamen ‘blide blue’ likhaa hua he
 People are taking it from many angles - first to make WWE famous in India and second to promote smackdown on the pretext of Virat Kohli
 kuch dinon pehle jon seenaa ne bagha seemaa par bharat-paak kii sena ke javaanon kii khaas tasviir bhi post kii thi
 Obviously, his attachment is with India somewhere
 
 
 jon seenaa kaa WWE kii duniya main bada naam he
 He has been a 15-time world champion
 12 baar WWE champion or 3 baar world heviveet champion kaa khitaab unke naam he
 In such a situation, they do not need any publicity for themselves
 unke fain to bharat main bhi hai, lekin utani badi sankhya main nahin, jitne ki pashchimi deshon main hai
 In such a situation, the news is that WWE is looking for a new market
 aise main arabon kii jansankhya vaala bharat uske liye ek bada bazaar ho saktaa he
 There is also a message hidden in the picture 'bleed Blue' that it matches WWE smackdown
 gauratlab he ki smacdown ke logo kaa rang bhi nila he, isliye aisa mana ja rahaa he ki unhone kohli kii is tasviir se uskaa bhi prachaar kiya he
 Since smackdown's logo is blue, John Cena may have searched the internet with a bleed blue theme and found a photo of Kohli
 seenaa ne viraat vaali photo ke baad ek or tasviir post kii, usamen bhi 'blide blue’ likhaa hua he
 Take a second look, since this world-renowned wrestler has not written any message with Virat's picture, his doing so is being appreciated as Virat
 viraat kohli bhi gym main ghanton pasinaa bahaate hai or apni fitness ko lekar khaase sajag rahete hai
 Not only this, he has been in a lot of discussion about his fitness recently and the media from India and abroad have written a lot on him
 jaahir he aise main raceling ring main dhamal machaane vaale jon seenaa bhi unase parichit hue honge or viraat kohli kii joshili tasviir post karke team india kaa utsaah badhaayaa he
 Recently, German footballer Tony Kruse also sent a gift to Kohli
 tippaniyan Apart from this, it may be that John Cena has an attachment with India and he is keen to know about India and the big players here and are encouraging Team India
 isaki pushti ek tasviir se hoti he
 Actually, he had posted a picture of the Bagha border of india-pakistan border, which is of the beating retreat ceremony
 
 
 a photo posted by John Cena (@johncena) on May 4, 2016 at 8:49am PDT Currently, this picture shared by Cena is being heavily praised and the WWE smackdown's look on the Indian market seems more correct
 vaise bhi viraat kohli in dinon alag-alag khelon ko pramot kar rahe hai
 
 
 Then why did wrestling lag behind

 tasviir main likhe 'bleed Blue' main ek sandesh bhi chipa he ki yah WWE smacdown se mail kha rahaa he
 Significantly, the color of the logo of smackdown is also blue, so it is believed that he has also promoted it with this picture of Kohli
 chunki smacdown ke logo kaa rang nila he, isliye ho saktaa he ki jon seenaa ne blide blue theme vaali internet par talaashi ho or unhen kohli vaali photo mil gai ho
 Sina posted another picture after Virat's photo, it also has 'bleed Blue' written on it
 doosraa najariya dekhie, chunki is vishwaprasiddh resler ne viraat kii tasviir ke saath koi sandesh nahin likhaa he, isliye unke aisa karne ko viraat kii prashansa ke taur par liya ja rahaa he
 Virat Kohli also sweats for hours in the gym and remains vigilant about his fitness
 itnaa hi nahin haal hi main vah apni fitness ko lekar kaaphi charchaa main rahe hai or desh-videsh ke media ne un par kaaphi kuch likhaa he
 Apparently, John Cena, who went on a rampage in the wrestling ring, must have been familiar with him and has encouraged the enthusiasm of Team India by posting a racy picture of Virat Kohli
 haal hi main german footballar tony cross ne bhi kohli ko ek tohfa bheja tha
 The comments iske alaava ho saktaa he ki jon seenaa kaa bharat se lagaav ho or vah bharat va yahaan ke bade khilaadiyon ke bare main jaanane ko utsuk rahete hon or team india kaa utsaah badha rahe hon

 It is a known fact that jaish-e-mohammed and its leader Masood Azhar are in Pakistan and this evidence should be sufficient for Pakistan to take action

 Despite the evidence given to Pakistan even during the 26 / 11 Mumbai attack, no progress was made in this case even after 10 years

 The Foreign Ministry spokesman said that the Prime Minister of Pakistan neither condemned the blasphemy incident nor felt it appropriate to express condolences to the bereaved families
 yah khedjanak he ki imran khan ne pulavama hamale par bharat ke jawaab ko aagaamee chunaav se prerit bataaya he, bharat iskaa khandan karata he
 At the same time, India demands that Pakistan stop misleading the international community and take concrete, clear action against the perpetrators of the Pulwama attack
 raveesh kumaar ne kaha ki pakistan ke pradhanmantri ne baatcheet kii peshkash karte hue aatankwaad par baat karne kii baat kahi he
 India has been reiterating that we are ready for bilateral dialogue on every issue in an atmosphere free of terror and violence
 unhone kaha ki pakistan daawa karata he ki wo aatankwaad kaa sabase bada peedit he
 But this is beyond the fact
 antarrashtriya samudaay is hakeekat se bhaleebhanti parichit he ki pakistan aatankwaad kaa centre he
 Significantly, Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan, in a video message released on Tuesday, denied Islamabad's hand in the Pulwama attack, saying that on receiving actionable evidence, he assures that action will be taken
 imran ne bharat ko dhamkee bhi di thi agar wo hamalaa karata he to paak ke paas iskaa jawaab dene ke alaava koi doosraa vikalp nahin hoga
 He also said that it is in our hands to start a war, but Allah knows when it will end

 Baglay said that today the International Court in an order given at the request of India has instructed Pakistan to take all such steps which are possible in this case
 jadhav ko pakistan kii sainya adaalat sunaaya gaya matyudand tak tak kriyanvit nahin kiya jayega, jab court kaa antim faisla nahin aata
 At the same time, the court has asked Pakistan to tell what steps it has taken to implement this order
 unhone kaha, ham is aadesh ko iy najariye se dekhte hai ki pakistan ne jadhav ke adhikaar or antarrashtriya niyamon kaa jo hanan kiya he, use sahi karne kii disha main yah pehla kadam he

 gogoi ne kaha, ''hamane beatisi netritv ko kah diya he ki avaidh tareeke se rah rahe kisi bhi vyakti ke liye beatiedi kshetron main koi jagah nahin
 Only real landowners will remain in BTAD areas
 ''gogoi kaa yah rukh un kai you-turn main se ek he jo unhone beatiedi kshetron main 28 july ko hinsa bhadakne ke baad se liye hai
 The Chief Minister had said, "actually, it is a fight of mutual interest over land

 Football lovers can also be classified due to their traits and characteristics
 aamtaur par yahaan chaar kism ke footbal premi paae jate hai
 In the first variety, all those people who call football or know 'soccer', even if they do not know the difference between Ronaldo and Ronaldinho, but by knowing so much, a license to be a football lover can be found but those on Facebook ' i love Messi 'or' Neymar is Rockstar, i love this game, what a match ', he keeps on updating the first kind of people
 ye duusari kism ke footbal premi hote hai
 The maximum limit of his love for football is that even if the number 10 jersey is seen anywhere in the market, he buys the jump and then sees the first ones like the children of convent schools see the government schools
 teesri kism ke footbal premi wo hote hai jo deshon se zyada bhav klbon ko dete hai
 Which club bought which player for how many years? These are the ascetic people who wake up at three o'clock at night to watch the matches of Chelsea and Barcelona due to difference in time zone

 unhone kaha, ‘‘koi baat nahin
 Being a celebrity cricketer in India is not easy
 main samajhataa hum ki viraat ke liye logon kii maangon se bachakar nikalnaa kitna mushkil hota he
 This is his phase
 ’’ kapil dev bhi 24 varsh ke hi the, jab unki captaini main bharat ne pehali baar world cap jeeta tha

 Kohli nods in approval, "sir, you can only say that
" ’’kapil, 2007 main aapane viraat ke bare main kaha tha, ‘‘bada acha munda he
 What is special about them? And Virat, did Kapil talk to you? Kapil Dev: No, i did not say that to him
 unhone under-19 world cap khelaa tha or maine unka kaaphi naam suna tha
 i liked their attitude towards the game and the way they played
 viraat kohli:mujhe sar se pehali mulaakaat yaad he
 He congratulated me
 tab tak maine unhen sirf tivi par dekha tha
 The current Indian team wants to win
 kapil, jab aapane shuruyaat kii thi, tab to drow ko bhi jeet kii tarah mana jaataa tha
 Kapil: Then we were children in international cricket
 hamen bharpoor pyaar, lagaav or pahchaan milti thi
 It is the same with today's cricketers
 par ham apni privet life bhi achche se jite the
 Virat, do you like having a private life? Kohli: Absolutely
 main us jamaane main westeindies, australia yaa england kii alag tarah kii tej gendbaaji kii ore dhyaan dilaanaa chaahunga
 i would like to praise the batsmen of that era because there was a lot of competition in cricket, there were not enough security measures
 agar kapil ipiel tii20 khelte hai to kya aap unhen apni team main chahenge?kohli:ve hamaare liye sabase keemtee khilaadi hote
 He was a promising fast bowler and batsman
 aap donon kaaphi kam umr main world cap jeet chuke hai
 In 1983, the cricket board did not have the money to honor the team
 lata mangeshkar ne ek concert kiya or isse mili rakam khiladinnon main banti gai
 How different is the situation today? Kapil: Money was not so important then
 aaj bhi aisa hi he
 It seems that the players make a lot of money, but what percentage of it they get? i still feel that the money that cricketers make is not enough
 viraat, world cap ke dauraan aap maidan main ro pade the
 Kohli: It was my first World Cup
 mujhe world cap jeetne vaali team kaa hissaa hone par garv tha
 i certainly cannot compare myself to Sir's feelings as he was the captain of the 1983 World Cup winning team
 tab bharat main cricket kii shuruyaat hui thi, ek dharm kii
 It was a revolution
 jab hamane 2011 main ise jeeta to yah ek sapana tha
 Kapil: i can say that we did not dream
 ham aisa sapana dekh hi nahin sakate the
 He was under pressure, was not you? Kapil: No, we had not dreamed it
 hamaara sapana sirf qualifi karne kaa hi tha
 Sometimes things fall into the lap
 aaj ke cricketer sapana dekh sakate hai
 According to experience, today they are better than us
 aap donon ke liye pakistan ke khilaaf khilne ke kya myne hai?kapil:tab hamaare upar bahut dabaav rahata tha
 Pakistan was better than us then
 ve maarak dhang se khelte the, jiskaa hamamen abhaav tha
 The great cricketer of Pakistan belongs to the same time
 unke paas sab kuch tha
 He had Imran Khan
 vahi bharat or pakistan main antar laa dete the
 India now plays better than Pakistan, is it because there is a change in thinking or there are no good players in Pakistan? Kohli: There has always been a rivalry
 ham bharat or pakistan ke puraane match dekhakar prerit hote the
 Aggressive attitude is needed and it should be collectively
 kapil, jab aap captain bane the to kaaphi yuva the
 Did you make some changes yourself to lead senior players? Kapil: i understood that you can give orders by the time you are the captain
 maidan se baahar main apane seniors ke sammaan main kursi chhod detaa tha
 But as soon as i took responsibility again, my tone changed
 viraat, kya aap bhi captain banane ke baad aise hi safagoi vaale rahenge?kohli:maine dhoni main aisi soch dekhi he
 i once asked him what would be needed to become the favorite captain of players like Sachin and Veeru (virender Sehwag), then he said the same thing, respect him outside the field, execute his plans
 main philhal captaini ke bare main soch bhi nahin saktaa
 Kapil, the Sachin Tendulkar you know is different from Virat Kohli's Sachin
 aap jab bharat ke liye khel rahe the tab ve bachche the or aaj ve bhartiya cricket ke ek bada naam ban chuke hai
 Kapil: Then he used to eat all the time
 mujhe england kaa daura yaad he, unhen skool ke exam dene the
 He also brought books with him
 main nahin jaanata ki unhen padhgaye ke liye kitna samay miltaa tha
 When i returned at night, i saw that they were sleeping with books on their chest
 mujhe dayaa ai ki unhen videsh main cricket khilne kii jagah apane maa-baap ke paas hona chahie tha
 Kohli: When i saw Sachin, he was sitting in the corner in the dressing room
 main 15 minute tak unhen dekhtaa rahaa
 When he looked at me my eyes were bent, i could not understand what to say
 unhone meri pehali siries ke liye mujhe badhai di or maine raahat kii saans lee
 He inspired me to move forward in the game
 viraat, kya sachin tendulkar ke baad cricket kii kalpana karnaa mushkil he?kohli:aap is bare main soch bhi nahin sakate
 We have seen a time when people used to worship him
 jab ve sanyas lenge to vah dukhad din hoga
 Kapil, you have also been heartbroken
 ab viraat hai
 Kapil: These days girls love cricket very much and these boys are very much fans
 hamaare samay main, ravi shastri or dilip vengsarakar dilon kii dhadkan hua karte the
 i was not a man who liked women

 har roj sanjay fasebuk par apni jindagi ke anubhavon se judi kahaniyaan likhte hai or unheen anubhavon ko unhone jindagi main sanjoya he
 They believe that man is driven by emotions, not by reason
 kaarnon se to mashine chalati hai
 Earlier, Sanjay's book Rishtey was much liked, and three volumes were published in three months
 rishte kii agali kadi he jindagi jisamen lekhak ne maa or bhai ke rishton ko sabase zyada ahmiyat di he
 It is clear from this book how deeply the author had a connection with his mother
 unki maa ne mrityu se ek raat pehle unhen bataaya tha ki ve kal chali jaaengi
 Sanjay writes, "I asked my mother, how will i be alone if you leave?" maa ne kaha, main tumhaare aas-paas hi rahuungi, har pal
 "this part of life is very poignant
 kitaab kii bahut-si baaten hamen apni jindagi kaa aainaa lagati hai

 As a result, he got a caravan full of relationships including mother, brother, sister, friends and then started posting regularly on Facebook
 sanjay sinha kii is jindagi kii shuruyaat hoti he 21 november se
 The author has recorded many small incidents in the book and tried to convey important messages through them
 pehle bharosa karke phir aajamaane vaale vyaktiyon ke vishay main sanjay kehete hai ki ve praayah tanha rah jate hai kyonki ve bhaawanaaon se sanchalit hote hai
 Life tells us that no matter how much a man does, one day everything will be left, if only the relationship will remain
 tan kii nazdikiyaan jab man kii nazdikiyon main tabdeel hoti hai tabhi rishta sachcha or pyaar bharaa hota he
 Sanjay has also given ways to know the difference between himself and the alien from his experiences
 sanjay likhte hai ki apano kii chot man tak lagati he
 Trouble of the body goes right, but a man gets hurt due to injury of mind
 ve likhte hai, “yaad rakhie jindagi sirf hamaari amaanat nahin, us par bahuton kaa adhikaar he or us adhikaar ko chhinane kaa haq kisi ko nahin
 We love life and do not try to tie it
 prem to samarpan he bandhan nahin, samarpan se hi khushi milti he
 "sanjay says that his mother had said," If you are happy, then the rest will start meeting on its own
 ” unhen har pal apane aas-paas apni maa kaa ehsaas rahata he

" ”fasebuk par post karte-karte sanjay ke apano kii fehrist bhi lambii hui he or jindagi ke anubhav bhi
 Based on these, they say that relationships are very important in life, so share love
 jindagi sandesh detii he ki rishton main khud ko niyantran main rakhie tabhi bharosa penpega
 Never face such people who are not entitled to it even in the face of compulsion in life, otherwise one day they will drown you with them
 jab amitabh bachchan ne ek mulaakaat main lekhak kii peeth par haath pherakar kaha “khush raho” to unhen yaad aayaa ki unki maa kahati thim ki acchhee bhaavana ke saath kiye gaye kaam se aashirwad avashya miltaa he
 Deeply feeling the pain of an elderly Facebook member, the author wrote in life, "you are entitled to respect only when you respect your parents
" rishte, man ke bhav hote hai
 Try to live them
 bado kaa sammaan kiijie
 When you always feel that someone is with you then self-confidence increases and this is what gives success
 tutaa hua rishta kabhi judata nahin
 Then save the relationship with love, with affection, do not break it
 ”jindagi main sanjay ke shabdon main, “shaadi ke baad jo bhi meri patni se mila, sabane kaha yah tumhaari maa kaa punarjanm he
 "he says that life is the name of the deep sea of contradictions and fantasies
" kitaab main lekhak ne sirf shabdon ke saath hi kai tarah ke prayog nahin kiye balki unki puri lekhan style hi apane aap main anoothaa prayog he

 his name was cut from team official category

 The electoral mercury in Gujarat is at its peak
 netaaon kii bayaanbaji talkh hoti ja rahi he
 In Gujarat, development is on the target of Rahul Gandhi and on the target of Modi and BJP, the Rahul and Gandhi families themselves
 rahul gandhi ke mandir dauron par tippanee karne ke baad buudhvaar ko soshal media par bijepi se jude log # rahul_nonhindu trend karaate rahe
 Actually, it happened because on Wednesday, the current Vice President of Congress, Rahul Gandhi went to visit the world famous Somnath temple
 mandir main aaagantukon kii entry ke liye do tarah ke register rakhe gaye hai
 The first was for Hindu visitors while the second register was for 'non-hindu' people
 congress ke media koardinator ne rahul gandhi ke naam kii entry 'gaiyr-hindu' logon vaale register main kar di
 Soon after, the picture of the register went viral on social media
 congress ne jamkar kiya palatwarabijepi dwaara rahul gandhi ke dharm par tippanee karne ke baad congress bhi maidan main utari or apane netaa kaa bachaav kiya
 Congress held a press conference and said that Rahul Gandhi's religion is Hindu
 yahi nahin congress ne rahul ko 'janeudhari hindu' bataaya
 Several posts were also made in favor of Rahul on social media
 kai aisi tasviren share kii gayi jisamen rahul gandhi janeu pahane najar aa rahe the
 Fearing a setback to the Congress, the Congress had to do so because the Congress had devised a strategy of soft Hindutva under the leadership of Rahul Gandhi in the Gujarat assembly elections
 rahul ab tak takreeban 20 se zyada mandiron main mattha tech chuke hai, lekin gaiyr hindu vaale register main sin karne kii ek galati ne congress kii soft hindutv vaali ranneeti main sui chubho di he
 So is it necessary for India to be a 'hindu leader'! If Rahul Gandhi is a Hindu or a non-hindu, it is so important that the parties leave other issues and debate on the same issue, then will there be no message in the world that the leader of India will be elected The most important of the standards required is to be 'hindu'
 yah to saraasar bharat ke samvidhan kii avhelnaa hogi!is mudde par yahaan samvidhan kii baat naa ho aisa nahin ho saktaa
 The Preamble of the Constitution clearly states, "we, the people of India, to make India a complete sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic republic and all its citizens
" 
 
 "uddeshika main spasht ullekh he 'panthanirpeksh' yani secular
 
 
 So, does the BJP not seem to be ignoring the Constitution by raising this issue
 to kya bharat ko haraakar chunaav jeetna chaahati he bijepi?is chunaav main bhi is mudde ko bada karke bijepi 'hindu card' khelnaa chaahati he
 The reason behind bjp's last few victories has been the organized and unilateral Hindu vote
 aise main agar gujarat chunaav bhi bijepi vikaas ke mudde se itar hindutv ke mudde par jeetna chaahati he to yah vah 'bharat ko haraakar' karegi
 Because the soul of India dwells in 'sarvadharma Sambhav'
 hamaari tahjeeb gangaajamuni he
 Here Hindus and Muslims, Sikhs, Christians all live together
 hamaara yakeen 'vasudaiv kutumbakam' main he
 Why this controversy started? Actually, this dispute with the current Gandhi family has been linked since the first woman Prime Minister of the country Indira Gandhi chose the late Feroze Gandhi as her partner
 pandit nehru kii naaraazgi ke baavjood indira ne firoz se shaadi kii
 Later, after joining active politics, the distance between Indira and Feroze increased
 bataaya jaataa he ki swargeey firoz gandhi kii kabr aaj bhi elahabaad ke mamfordganj main sthit he
 Later, Rajiv Gandhi also married 'non-hindu' Sonia Gandhi
 sonia dharm se chrishchiyan hai
 This is the reason why the true religion of the Gandhi family remains skeptical on this and such disputes keep coming up
 jabaki rahul gandhi khud or unki party yah spasht kar chuki he ki ve hindu dharm maanate hai
 The Lok Sabha election-2019 has also become interesting in terms of campaigning 
 pratyaashee apane-apane kshetra main prachaar ke jariye chutki le rahe hai
 Congress candidate from up's Kushinagar parliamentary constituency RPN Singh was seen faking pakoda and making jalebi during the campaign
 ravivaar ko arpyen singh kushinagar ke horlapur gaanv main yojit ek meley main pakora or jalebi banaai

 " rohit shetty ne bollywood main back tu back badi hit filmein di hai
 Be it 'golmaal' series, 'singham' and Singham Returns' or 'chennai Express'
 rohit critics kii unki filmon ko lekar raay par yakeen nahin rakhte, balki darshakon ke faisle par yakeen karte hai
 It is a good thing, but sad that this time he took his loved ones lightly and himself appeared to be riding on high confidence
 shahrukh ke saath 'chennai express' jaisi antertaning film dene ke baad rohit'dilavaale' jaisi bachakanifilm lekar aae he
 Even more sad is that Shahrukh Khan is seen as a side hero throughout the film
 is baar rohit shetty ne shahrukh khan kii shandaar entry kii jagah yah mauka varun dhawan ko diya he
 Not getting the chance to whistle is that the entry of superstars means a lot in any film, because this is the time when their fans in the cinema hall play fiercely
 lekin is baar shahrukh ke phens ko yah mauka nahin mila
 By the way, Shah Rukh, considered a sensitive actor, has been in the headlines for some time due to his poor choice of films
 varun ke hisse shahrukh se zyada mauka'dilavaale' kii puri script main lagbhag 40 fisadi hissaa varun dhawan ke naam kar diya gaya or 10 fisadi baaki ke kalakaaron or kaaron ke
 Shahrukh Khan's share of the remaining 50 per cent of the time came, of which 25 per cent see him trying to become a Sharif and in 25 per cent he appears to be a 'kali' to become a 'raj'
 'kaali' ke taur par ve majaa dilaate hai or unka intjaar rahata he, lekin rohit shetty ne na jane kya sochaa or 'kaali' par puri film main 'raaj' ko haaavee karne kii koshish kii
 Rohit Fans, who had forgotten Shahrukh, broke a mountain of grief when he went to see it as a Shahrukh film
 lekin yah rohit shetty kii film nikali, kyonki isamen saare sitare vah the jo aksar unki filmon main najar aate hai
 He then forgets Shah Rukh Khan and deals with the film in a very childish manner, in order to trap so many actors
 is tarah rohit shetty jaise ek honhaar diarector ne shahrukh jaise antertaning actor ke tallent ko bekaar kar diya yaa kahen ki shahrukh jaise superstar ne rohit par andhvishwaas kar liya
 Karishma not left in Kajol was a fresh pair in need of 'dilwale'
 rohit ne shahrukh ke liye kaajol ko chunaa or kaajol main ab vah karishma nahin bachaa he
 Perhaps Rohit made this film by seeing box office grosses not by heart and perhaps he has been a little successful in it so far
 lekin isamen koi shubahaa nahin ki 'baazeegar' kamayega to sahi, lekin dil main nahin samayega

 Can such a statement come from the current Chief Minister of a state that people will be forced to vote for us because they will be so subdued by their troubles that they hold us responsible for not providing facilities like employment, water, roads? There will be no time

 Not only is the edited clip of a BJP event in Jaipur being shared on social media, but Congress spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala has made a similar statement
 surajevaala ne guuruuvaar ko ajtak news channel ke ek kaarykram main daawa kiya ki “rajasthan kii mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje ne bijepi kaaryakartaaon se kaha he ki aam logon ko is had tak bhram main daal do ki kisi ke paas aise sawaal karne kaa vakt hi naa rahe ki sadaken kyon nahin baniin? pani kii killat kyon he? naukariyaan kyon nahin hai? kyon logon ko peeta ja rahaa he or kisaan kyon behaal hai? aisa vichaar logon ko bhram main daalkar unke vot hasil karne ke liye he
 It simply means that the Chief Minister himself has given up
 ”surajevaala ne kaarykram ke us video ko bhi twit kiya he jisamen isi tarah kaa daawa he
 Vasundhara ji told his workers that make everyone so confused that no one should say why the roads are not built, why there is no water, why there is no job, why people are pitched, why the farmer is helpless, - Will confuse you

 The CBI has arrested five people, including two top officials of Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal
 inamen mukhyamantri ke pradhan sachiv rajendra kumaar or up sachiv tarun sharma shaamil hai
 The CBI has described Rajendra Kumar as the mastermind of the Rs 50 crore scam
 rajendra kumaar par aarope he ki unhone kai front companiyaan banaakar bina tender sarkari contract die, jisase dilli sarkaar ko karodon kaa nuksaan hua
 The entire case began on December 15 last year when the CBI raided the Chief Minister's office at the Delhi Secretariat and seized files related to the Chief Minister's Principal Secretary Rajendra Kumar
 chhaapon ke baad arvind kejariwal ne kaha tha ki sibiai ne DDCA se judi file ko dhundne ke liye unke daphtar par chapa maaraa
 Kejriwal had said that Finance Minister Arun Jaitley was getting trapped on the basis of that file
 lekin baad main sibiai ne rajendra kumaar par bhrashtachar kaa aarope lagaaya
 Rajendra Kumar has been booked on charges of misusing his office and getting a company worth Rs nine and a half crores from 2007 to 2014
 sibiai ke mutabik 2006 main rajendra kumaar ne dilli sarkaar ko IT solutions or software dene ke liye ek company Endeavours Systems Private Ltd banaai
 The CBI alleges that Rajendra Kumar got contracts for information technology related work of Delhi government to Endeavor Systems
 iske liye company ko kai public sector uniton ke panel main bhi shaamil kiya gaya, taaki use bina tender ke sarkari kaam mil sake
 Propaganda and sports under the garb of news is becoming difficult to understand when and which incident is news in Delhi's politics
 dilli main har duusare din donon pakshon kii taraf se koi na koi maamla uthta he or ghamaasan machataa he
 Sometimes the MLA is arrested, sometimes there is an FIR against the minister, sometimes the President returns the law passed by the Assembly, sometimes the Office of Profit comes to the case of 21 mlas, sometimes the charges of counter-transfers are going on
 Looks like
 up rajyapal or mukhyamantri ke bich adhikaron kii ladaai or adhikariyon ke tabadale kii khabaron se abhi tak yah sunishchit nahin hua he ki yah sarkaar kaise chalati he
 Suddenly Delhi starts calling it a city, someone starts saying municipality, somebody starts saying something
 donon pakshon kii taraf se khub tark diye jate hai, khub hamale hote hai
 According to our colleague Ashish Bhargava, there are currently ten petitions in the Delhi High Court
 dilli sarkaar ne 2002 ke sienji fitness ghotaale kii jaanch ke liye ritred justise es en agarwal kii adhyakshata main ek jaanch ayog banaaya
 Justice Aggarwal has written a letter to the Lieutenant Governor saying that you have reduced the dignity of your office position, saying that you are bound by the orders of the Union Home Ministry
 justise agarwal ke is patr ke anusaar up rajyapal ne unki adhyakshata main bane ayog ko sahyog karne se manaa kar diya
 The Ministry of Home Affairs had declared the Commission made by the Delhi Government legally illegal
 is tarah kii takaraav kii ghatana dilli, centre or up rajyapal ke bich aam ho gai he
 Petitions are also going on in the Delhi High Court between Delhi and the Lieutenant Governor regarding the clarity of rights
 shuukravaar ko dilli sarkaar ne aisi spashtataa ke liye supreme court se darkhwaast kii ki is maamle ko jaldi suna jaae
 The hearing was scheduled for Monday but Justice JS Khehar distanced himself from the hearing
 ab maamle ko duusari bench ke paas bheja jayega
 The Delhi government wants a hearing in the Supreme Court instead of the High Court as the matter has been pending there for several months, affecting the functioning of the Delhi government
 samvidhan ke mutabik jab centre or rajya ke bich vivaad hota he to uskaa nipataara karne kaa adhikaar supreme court ko he na ki hoicourt ko
 Infinite debate on this conflict has been held in the media
 aam aadmi party ke virdohi swaraj abhiyaan ke sanyojak yogendra yadav ne bhi kaha he ki dedh saal ho gaye is maamle ko adaalat main
 Nothing has come out
 kisi na kisi ko ise samaapt karnaa hi hoga
 It is expected that the Supreme Court will give a clear verdict which will send a message to the people of Delhi, who rules the national capital
 kam se kam donon ke bich is ladaai kaa ant hona hi chahie
 In August last year, the Delhi government increased the circle rate of agricultural land
 up rajyapal ne dilli sarkaar ko is par yathasthiti banaae rakhane kaa aadesh de diya
 Two petitions against this decision were filed in the court
 tab hoicourt ne kaha ki unhen is baat kii jaanch kerani hogi ki apane naam se jari notification par up rajyapal ko dastakhat karne kii zarurat he yaa nahin
 The Home Ministry then issued an order that it reserved the right to appoint bureaucrats in the capital
 aae din takaraav kii khabaren aa rahi hai in sab kii jad main us faisla kaa intazaar he ki dilli main up rajyapal ke adhikaar kya hai or dilli sarkaar ke kya
 It is written in books, but when there are controversies for one and a half years, then it is important to have clarity on it
 yahi nahin dilli vidhansabha ke paas kiye gaye teen kanoonon ke bhi raashtrapati ke yahaan se bhej diye jane kii khabar ai thi
 It is clear that what will win in this debate will be the final argument or the interpretation of the Constitution
 samvidhan kii antim vyakhya koun karegaa
 Spokesperson or press conference or TV anchor
 donon taraf se hamalon main koi kami nahin rakhi ja rahi he
 On behalf of the Aam Aadmi Party, sometimes the issue of the Prime Minister's degree is raised, sometimes questions arise regarding the degree of his ministers
 aam aadmi party daleel detii he ki punjab or goa main uski badhati lokapriyata ke kaaran yah sab ho rahaa he
 This argument is political
 jab se centre or dilli ke bich takaraav shuru hua he tab punjab or goa chunaav kii baat bhi nahin thi
 The fact is that there is a confrontation between the two
 kis kaaran he or kis bhay se he yah sandarbh kii baat he
 Arvind Kejriwal is on a tour of Punjab
 aam aadmi party kaa daawa he ki vahaan use safalataa milane vaali he
 There are crowds in his meetings and there are some surveys due to which he has gone through the election victory
 goa main bhi survey ne jita diya he
 BJP says that if the elections were held then what is the relevance of the survey
 bijepi kaa kahana he ki iees afasar rajendra kumaar ke khilaaf kai saare maamle hai
 Kejriwal explain why he is trying to save a corrupt officer
 dilli main kathith rup se itane ghotaale nikal aae hai ki vakt kaa takaaza kahata he ki dilli ke liye sahi lokapal kii niyukti ho jaani chahie jiske bare main sab bhul gaye hai
 Had the Lokpal been there, he would have been investigating these cases of corruption independently
 jab anti karpshan beuro se hi kaam chalaanaa tha to desh kaa itnaa vakt kyon karaab kiya gaya or sansad ke paas kanoon kii kya manyata rah jaati he
 The comments somvaar ko anti karpshan beuro ne dilli ke jal sansaadhan mantri kapil mishra se poochtacha kii
 The ACB says Mishra did not cooperate with the investigation
 kapil mishra kaa kahana he ki asibi unhen fansaane kii koshish kar rahi he
 Kapil Mishra also reached the ACB with complete Lashkar like Jantar Mantar had gone
 is kathith tanker ghotaale kii jaanch beete saal kapil mishra ne hi karai thi
 Sheila Dixit held the government responsible for the alleged loss of 400 crores
 lekin jaanch ke baad karrwai main deree hui
 The tanker company was also not stopped
 asibi jaananaa chaahati he ki jaanch kii report aane ke baad kyon dabaai gai
 Kapil Mishra alleges that not a single question was asked about the role of Sheila Dixit
 mishra ne twit kiya ki unase asibi ke chah afasar poochtacha kar rahe hai
 Their motive is to trap me and Arvind Kejriwal
 saare vivaad sadak par nipataaye ja rahe hai
 Who is right has no meaning
 baat jab adaalat main pahonchegi or jab faisla aayega tabhi pataa chalegaa
 This decision has been coming for a year and a half, what are the rights of the Lieutenant Governor and Delhi Government
 ghamaasan bhayankar he donon ke bich
 The main battle goes on between BJP vs Aam Aadmi Party
 up mukhyamantri manish sisodiya ne somvaar ko kaha ki dopaher main aadesh mila ki dilli sarkaar ke 9 afasaron kaa tabadalaa kar diya gaya he
 Eleven officers have been transferred in two days
 18 may ko dilli sarkaar ne bhi 11 naukarshahon ke tabadale kiye the
 There are six IAS officers and five officers are officers of Delhi Andaman Nicobar Island Civil Services
 is puure maamle kii shuruyaat pichley saal 15 disambar ko hui jab sibiai ne dilli sachivalay main mukhyamantri ke karyaalay par chapa daalaa tha or mukhyamantri ke pradhan sachiv rajendra kumaar se judi filein zabt kar lee thim
 After the raids, Arvind Kejriwal said that the CBI raided his office to find the file related to the DDCA
 kejariwal ne kaha tha ki us fil ke aadhaar par vitt mantri arun jetali funs rahe the
 But the CBI later accused Rajendra Kumar of corruption
 rajendra kumaar par apane pad ke durupyog or 2007 se 2014 ke bich ek company ko saadhe nau karod ke tender dilwane ke aaropon main cese darj hue
 According to the CBI, in 2006, Rajendra Kumar formed Endeavours Systems Private Ltd, a company to provide IT solutions and software to the Delhi government
 sibiai kaa aarope he ki rajendra kumaar ne dilli sarkaar ke soochna takanic se jude kaamon ke theke Endeavour Systems ko dilwaaye
 For this, the company was also included in the panel of several public sector units, so that it could get government work without tender
 dilli kii raajnneeti main kab koun si ghatana khabar he or koun si ghatana khabar kii aad main propeganda or khel, samajhnaa mushkil hota ja rahaa he
 Every other day in Delhi, some matter arises from both the sides and there is an uproar
 kabhi vidhayak giraftaar hota he, kabhi mantri ke kilaaf exiaar hoti he, kabhi raashtrapati vidhansabha ke paas kiye hue kanoon lautaa dete hai, kabhi 21 vidhayakon ko lekar offis of profit kaa maamla aa jaataa he, kabhi afasaron ke tabadale ko lekar aarope-pratyarope chalane lagate hai
 The news of the fight for rights and transfer of officers between the Lieutenant Governor and the Chief Minister has not yet ascertained how this government operates
 achaanak dilli ko koi shahar kehane lagata he koi nagarpalika kehane lagata he, koi kuch kehane lagata he
 Plenty of arguments are given from both sides, there are many attacks
 hamaare sahyogi ashish bhargav ke mutabik dilli hoicourt main is vakt das yachikaayen hai
 The Delhi government set up an inquiry commission headed by retired Justice SN Aggarwal to investigate the 2002 CNG fitness scam
 justise agarwal ne up rajyapal ko patr likhakar kaha he ki aapane apane offis ke ohade kii garima giraayi he yah kehete hue ki aap kendriya grahamantralay ke adeshon se bandhe hai
 According to this letter of Justice Agarwal, the Lieutenant Governor refused to cooperate with the Commission headed by him
 grahamantralay ne dilli sarkaar ke banaae ayog ko kanoonee rup se avaidh qaraar diya tha
 This type of confrontation has become common between Delhi, Center and Lt
 Governor
 dilli hai court main dilli or up rajyapal ke bich adhikaron kii spashtataa ko lekar bhi yachikaayen chal rahi hai
 On Friday, the Delhi government requested the Supreme Court for such clarity that the matter should be heard quickly
 somvaar ko sunwaayee honi thi magar justise je es khehar ne sunwaayee se khud ko alag kar liya
 The matter will now be referred to another bench
 dilli sarkaar chaahati he ki hoicourt kii jagah supreme court main sunwaayee ho kyonki vahaan ye maamla kai maheenon se lambit he jisase dilli sarkaar kaa kaamkaaj prabhavit ho rahaa he
 According to the constitution, when there is a dispute between the Center and the state, the Supreme Court has the power to settle it and not the Hoicourt
 is takaraav par anant bahes media main bhi ho chuki he
 Yogendra Yadav, the convenor of the Aam Aadmi Party's anti-swaraj campaign, has also said that it has been one and a half years in court
 kuch bhi nahin niklaa he
 One has to end it
 ummid he supreme court spasht faisla degaa jisase dilli kii janata ko sandesh jaae ki rashtriya rajdhani par kiskaa shashan chalata he
 At least this fight between the two must end
 pichley saal agast main dilli sarkaar ne krishi bhoomi kaa cirkil rate badha diya
 The Lieutenant Governor ordered the Delhi government to maintain status quo on it
 is faisle ke khilaaf do yachikaayen adaalat main daayar ho gayi
 The High Court then said that they would have to investigate whether the Lieutenant Governor needed to sign the notification issued in his name
 phir grahamantralay ne aadesh jari kar diya ki rajdhani main naukarshahon kii niyukti kaa adhikaar uske paas surakshit he
 News of the confrontation is coming in the day, the root of all this is waiting for that decision, what are the rights of the Lieutenant Governor in Delhi and what is the Government of Delhi
 kitabon main to likhit hai magar jab dedh saal se vivaad ho rahe hai to is par spashtataa zaruri he
 Not only this, there was a news of three laws passed by the Delhi Legislative Assembly to be sent from here
 zaahir he ki is bahes main jo jitegaa wo antim daleel hogi yaa jo samvidhan kii vyakhya hogi
 Who will make the final interpretation of the constitution
 pravaktaa yaa press conference se hoga yaa tivi ke ankar se hoga
 There is no reduction in attacks from both sides
 aam aadmi party kii taraf se kabhi pradhanmantri kii degree kaa masalaa uchhaala jaataa he to kabhi unke mantriyon kii degree ko lekar sawaal uthne lagate hai
 The Aam Aadmi Party argues that this is happening due to its increasing popularity in Punjab and Goa
 yah tark raajnneetik he
 Ever since the confrontation between the Center and Delhi started, there was no talk of elections in Punjab and Goa
 tathy yah he ki donon ke bich takaraav he
 What is the reason and what is the fear is a matter of reference
 arvind kejariwal punjab ke daure par hai
 The Aam Aadmi Party claims that it is going to get success there
 uski sabhaaon main bheed aa rahi he or koi survey hai jiske kaaran ve chunaav jeet se gaye hai
 The survey has also won in Goa
 bijepi kahati he ki chunaav hue to nahin to survey kii kya praasangikta
 BJP says that there are many cases against IAS officer Rajendra Kumar
 kejariwal bataayen ki wo ek bhrasht adhikari ko bachaane kaa prayaas kyon kar rahe hai
 There have been so many scams in Delhi that the time has come to say that the right Lokpal should be appointed for Delhi, about which everyone has forgotten
 lokapal hota to bhrashtachar ke in maamalon kii swatantra rup se jaachan kar rahaa hota
 When the Anti Corruption Bureau was to operate itself, why was so much of the country's time wasted and what is the recognition of the law with the Parliament
 tippaniyan On Monday, the Anti Corruption Bureau questioned Delhi Water Resources Minister Kapil Mishra
 asibi kaa kahana he ki mishra ne jaanch main sahyog nahin kiya
 Kapil Mishra says that ACB is trying to trap him
 kapil mishra bhi puure laav lashkar ke saath asibi pahunche jaise jantar mantar gaye hon
 The alleged tanker scam was investigated by Kapil Mishra last year
 400 karod ke kathith nuksaan ke liye shila dikshit sarkaar ko zimmedaar tehraaya tha
 But action was delayed after the investigation
 tanker company ko bhi nahin roka gaya
 The ACB wants to know why the investigation report was suppressed after it came
 kapil mishra kaa aarope he ki unase shila dikshit kii bhoomika ko lekar ek bhi sawaal nahin kiya gaya
 Mishra tweeted that six ACB officers are questioning him
 unka makasad mujhe or arvind kejariwal ko fansaana he
 All disputes are being settled on the road
 koun sahi he iskaa koi matlab nahin he
 It will be known when the matter reaches the court and only when the verdict comes
 dedh saal se yahi faisla aa rahaa he ki up rajyapal or dilli sarkaar ke adhikaar kya hai
 The fire is fierce between the two
 bijepi banaam aam aadmi party ke bich mukhya ladaai chalati he
 Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said on Monday that orders were received in the afternoon that 9 officers of the Delhi government have been transferred
 do din main gyaarah afasaron kaa tabadalaa kiya gaya he
 On May 18, the Delhi government also transferred 11 bureaucrats
 jisamen chah iees afasar hai or paanch adhikari dilli andaman nicobar island civil services ke adhikari hai
 The CBI alleges that Rajendra Kumar got contracts for information technology related work of Delhi government to Endeavor Systems
 iske liye company ko kai public sector uniton ke panel main bhi shaamil kiya gaya, taaki use bina tender ke sarkari kaam mil sake
 Propaganda and sports under the garb of news is becoming difficult to understand when and which incident is news in Delhi's politics
 dilli main har duusare din donon pakshon kii taraf se koi na koi maamla uthta he or ghamaasan machataa he
 Sometimes the MLA is arrested, sometimes there is an FIR against the minister, sometimes the President returns the law passed by the Assembly, sometimes the Office of Profit comes to the case of 21 mlas, sometimes the charges of counter-transfers are going on
 Looks like
 up rajyapal or mukhyamantri ke bich adhikaron kii ladaai or adhikariyon ke tabadale kii khabaron se abhi tak yah sunishchit nahin hua he ki yah sarkaar kaise chalati he
 Suddenly Delhi starts calling it a city, someone starts saying municipality, somebody starts saying something
 donon pakshon kii taraf se khub tark diye jate hai, khub hamale hote hai
 According to our colleague Ashish Bhargava, there are currently ten petitions in the Delhi High Court
 dilli sarkaar ne 2002 ke sienji fitness ghotaale kii jaanch ke liye ritred justise es en agarwal kii adhyakshata main ek jaanch ayog banaaya
 Justice Aggarwal has written a letter to the Lieutenant Governor saying that you have reduced the dignity of your office position, saying that you are bound by the orders of the Union Home Ministry
 justise agarwal ke is patr ke anusaar up rajyapal ne unki adhyakshata main bane ayog ko sahyog karne se manaa kar diya
 The Ministry of Home Affairs had declared the Commission made by the Delhi Government legally illegal
 is tarah kii takaraav kii ghatana dilli, centre or up rajyapal ke bich aam ho gai he
 Petitions are also going on in the Delhi High Court between Delhi and the Lieutenant Governor regarding the clarity of rights
 shuukravaar ko dilli sarkaar ne aisi spashtataa ke liye supreme court se darkhwaast kii ki is maamle ko jaldi suna jaae
 The hearing was scheduled for Monday but Justice JS Khehar distanced himself from the hearing
 ab maamle ko duusari bench ke paas bheja jayega
 The Delhi government wants a hearing in the Supreme Court instead of the High Court as the matter has been pending there for several months, affecting the functioning of the Delhi government
 samvidhan ke mutabik jab centre or rajya ke bich vivaad hota he to uskaa nipataara karne kaa adhikaar supreme court ko he na ki hoicourt ko
 Infinite debate on this conflict has been held in the media
 aam aadmi party ke virdohi swaraj abhiyaan ke sanyojak yogendra yadav ne bhi kaha he ki dedh saal ho gaye is maamle ko adaalat main
 Nothing has come out
 kisi na kisi ko ise samaapt karnaa hi hoga
 It is expected that the Supreme Court will give a clear verdict which will send a message to the people of Delhi, who rules the national capital
 kam se kam donon ke bich is ladaai kaa ant hona hi chahie
 In August last year, the Delhi government increased the circle rate of agricultural land
 up rajyapal ne dilli sarkaar ko is par yathasthiti banaae rakhane kaa aadesh de diya
 Two petitions against this decision were filed in the court
 tab hoicourt ne kaha ki unhen is baat kii jaanch kerani hogi ki apane naam se jari notification par up rajyapal ko dastakhat karne kii zarurat he yaa nahin
 The Home Ministry then issued an order that it reserved the right to appoint bureaucrats in the capital
 aae din takaraav kii khabaren aa rahi hai in sab kii jad main us faisla kaa intazaar he ki dilli main up rajyapal ke adhikaar kya hai or dilli sarkaar ke kya
 It is written in books, but when there are controversies for one and a half years, then it is important to have clarity on it
 yahi nahin dilli vidhansabha ke paas kiye gaye teen kanoonon ke bhi raashtrapati ke yahaan se bhej diye jane kii khabar ai thi
 It is clear that what will win in this debate will be the final argument or the interpretation of the Constitution
 samvidhan kii antim vyakhya koun karegaa
 Spokesperson or press conference or TV anchor
 donon taraf se hamalon main koi kami nahin rakhi ja rahi he
 On behalf of the Aam Aadmi Party, sometimes the issue of the Prime Minister's degree is raised, sometimes questions arise regarding the degree of his ministers
 aam aadmi party daleel detii he ki punjab or goa main uski badhati lokapriyata ke kaaran yah sab ho rahaa he
 This argument is political
 jab se centre or dilli ke bich takaraav shuru hua he tab punjab or goa chunaav kii baat bhi nahin thi
 The fact is that there is a confrontation between the two
 kis kaaran he or kis bhay se he yah sandarbh kii baat he
 Arvind Kejriwal is at the zenith of Punjab 
 aam aadmi party kaa daawa he ki vahaan use safalataa milane vaali he
 There are crowds in his meetings and there are some surveys due to which he has gone through the election victory
 goa main bhi survey ne jita diya he
 BJP says that if the elections were held then what is the relevance of the survey
 bijepi kaa kahana he ki iees afasar rajendra kumaar ke khilaaf kai saare maamle hai
 Kejriwal explain why he is trying to save a corrupt officer
 dilli main kathith rup se itane ghotaale nikal aae hai ki vakt kaa takaaza kahata he ki dilli ke liye sahi lokapal kii niyukti ho jaani chahie jiske bare main sab bhul gaye hai
 Had the Lokpal been there, he would have been investigating these cases of corruption independently
 jab anti karpshan beuro se hi kaam chalaanaa tha to desh kaa itnaa vakt kyon karaab kiya gaya or sansad ke paas kanoon kii kya manyata rah jaati he
 The comments somvaar ko anti karpshan beuro ne dilli ke jal sansaadhan mantri kapil mishra se poochtacha kii
 The ACB says Mishra did not cooperate with the investigation
 kapil mishra kaa kahana he ki asibi unhen fansaane kii koshish kar rahi he
 Kapil Mishra also reached the ACB with complete Lashkar like Jantar Mantar had gone
 is kathith tanker ghotaale kii jaanch beete saal kapil mishra ne hi karai thi
 Sheila Dixit held the government responsible for the alleged loss of 400 crores
 lekin jaanch ke baad karrwai main deree hui
 The tanker company was also not stopped
 asibi jaananaa chaahati he ki jaanch kii report aane ke baad kyon dabaai gai
 Kapil Mishra alleges that not a single question was asked about the role of Sheila Dixit
 mishra ne twit kiya ki unase asibi ke chah afasar poochtacha kar rahe hai
 Their motive is to trap me and Arvind Kejriwal
 saare vivaad sadak par nipataaye ja rahe hai
 Who is right has no meaning
 baat jab adaalat main pahonchegi or jab faisla aayega tabhi pataa chalegaa
 This decision has been coming for a year and a half, what are the rights of the Lieutenant Governor and Delhi Government
 ghamaasan bhayankar he donon ke bich
 The main battle goes on between BJP vs Aam Aadmi Party
 up mukhyamantri manish sisodiya ne somvaar ko kaha ki dopaher main aadesh mila ki dilli sarkaar ke 9 afasaron kaa tabadalaa kar diya gaya he
 Eleven officers have been transferred in two days
 18 may ko dilli sarkaar ne bhi 11 naukarshahon ke tabadale kiye the
 There are six IAS officers and five officers are officers of Delhi Andaman Nicobar Island Civil Services
 dilli kii raajnneeti main kab koun si ghatana khabar he or koun si ghatana khabar kii aad main propeganda or khel, samajhnaa mushkil hota ja rahaa he
 Every other day in Delhi, some matter arises from both the sides and there is an uproar
 kabhi vidhayak giraftaar hota he, kabhi mantri ke kilaaf exiaar hoti he, kabhi raashtrapati vidhansabha ke paas kiye hue kanoon lautaa dete hai, kabhi 21 vidhayakon ko lekar offis of profit kaa maamla aa jaataa he, kabhi afasaron ke tabadale ko lekar aarope-pratyarope chalane lagate hai
 The news of the fight for rights and transfer of officers between the Lieutenant Governor and the Chief Minister has not yet ascertained how this government operates
 achaanak dilli ko koi shahar kehane lagata he koi nagarpalika kehane lagata he, koi kuch kehane lagata he
 Plenty of arguments are given from both sides, there are many attacks
 hamaare sahyogi ashish bhargav ke mutabik dilli hoicourt main is vakt das yachikaayen hai
 The Delhi government set up an inquiry commission headed by retired Justice SN Aggarwal to investigate the 2002 CNG fitness scam
 justise agarwal ne up rajyapal ko patr likhakar kaha he ki aapane apane offis ke ohade kii garima giraayi he yah kehete hue ki aap kendriya grahamantralay ke adeshon se bandhe hai
 According to this letter of Justice Agarwal, the Lieutenant Governor refused to cooperate with the Commission headed by him
 grahamantralay ne dilli sarkaar ke banaae ayog ko kanoonee rup se avaidh qaraar diya tha
 This type of confrontation has become common between Delhi, Center and Lt
 Governor
 dilli hai court main dilli or up rajyapal ke bich adhikaron kii spashtataa ko lekar bhi yachikaayen chal rahi hai
 On Friday, the Delhi government requested the Supreme Court for such clarity that the matter should be heard quickly
 somvaar ko sunwaayee honi thi magar justise je es khehar ne sunwaayee se khud ko alag kar liya
 The matter will now be referred to another bench
 dilli sarkaar chaahati he ki hoicourt kii jagah supreme court main sunwaayee ho kyonki vahaan ye maamla kai maheenon se lambit he jisase dilli sarkaar kaa kaamkaaj prabhavit ho rahaa he
 According to the constitution, when there is a dispute between the Center and the state, the Supreme Court has the power to settle it and not the Hoicourt
 is takaraav par anant bahes media main bhi ho chuki he
 Yogendra Yadav, the convenor of the Aam Aadmi Party's anti-swaraj campaign, has also said that it has been one and a half years in court
 kuch bhi nahin niklaa he
 One has to end it
 ummid he supreme court spasht faisla degaa jisase dilli kii janata ko sandesh jaae ki rashtriya rajdhani par kiskaa shashan chalata he
 At least this fight between the two must end
 pichley saal agast main dilli sarkaar ne krishi bhoomi kaa cirkil rate badha diya
 The Lieutenant Governor ordered the Delhi government to maintain status quo on it
 is faisle ke khilaaf do yachikaayen adaalat main daayar ho gayi
 The High Court then said that they would have to investigate whether the Lieutenant Governor needed to sign the notification issued in his name
 phir grahamantralay ne aadesh jari kar diya ki rajdhani main naukarshahon kii niyukti kaa adhikaar uske paas surakshit he
 News of the confrontation is coming in the day, the root of all this is waiting for that decision, what are the rights of the Lieutenant Governor in Delhi and what is the Government of Delhi
 kitabon main to likhit hai magar jab dedh saal se vivaad ho rahe hai to is par spashtataa zaruri he
 Not only this, there was a news of three laws passed by the Delhi Legislative Assembly to be sent from here
 zaahir he ki is bahes main jo jitegaa wo antim daleel hogi yaa jo samvidhan kii vyakhya hogi
 Who will make the final interpretation of the constitution
 pravaktaa yaa press conference se hoga yaa tivi ke ankar se hoga
 There is no reduction in attacks from both sides
 aam aadmi party kii taraf se kabhi pradhanmantri kii degree kaa masalaa uchhaala jaataa he to kabhi unke mantriyon kii degree ko lekar sawaal uthne lagate hai
 The Aam Aadmi Party argues that this is happening due to its increasing popularity in Punjab and Goa
 yah tark raajnneetik he
 Ever since the confrontation between the Center and Delhi started, there was no talk of elections in Punjab and Goa
 tathy yah he ki donon ke bich takaraav he
 What is the reason and what is the fear is a matter of reference
 arvind kejariwal punjab ke daure par hai
 The Aam Aadmi Party claims that it is going to get success there
 uski sabhaaon main bheed aa rahi he or koi survey hai jiske kaaran ve chunaav jeet se gaye hai
 The survey has also won in Goa
 bijepi kahati he ki chunaav hue to nahin to survey kii kya praasangikta
