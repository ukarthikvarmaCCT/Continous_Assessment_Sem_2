 abhaya choudhary ne likhaa he ki patna ke chaatr kaa centre jabalpur padaa he

 aise pariwaron ke bacchon ko do se teen hazaar kharch kar apane zile se chennai janaa pade, mohali janaa pade, hyderabad janaa pade, thodi zyaadati he
 Sonbhad in UP is a very poor area
 yahaan ke chaatr kaa centre mohali padegaa to ve 1500 se 2000 kaa karch nahin uthaa sakenge
 When the exam is online, then what is the point of giving the center from here to there

 The examination is to begin from 9 August
 agar rajyon ke mukhyamantri rail mantri se baat kar in chaatro kaa kiraaya maaf karvaa den to main bilkul iskaa shrey nahin luungaa

 Children of such families have to spend two to three thousand to go to Chennai from their district, go to Mohali, go to Hyderabad, a little more
 upi kaa sonbhadd behad garib ilaaka he
 If the center of the student here is in Mohali, then they will not be able to spend 1500 to 2000

 Either the Chief Minister of Bihar should give 2-2 thousand to all these students or they should also talk to the Railway Minister about why this is happening to poor students and how it can happen

 Return tickets are not available

 There is no confidence in the timing of the railways, so we have to leave two to three days in advance
 ye sab kharche or samay kaa hisaab railway recruitment board ne kyon nahin kiya
 Has it been done so that large number of students cannot reach and miss the exam

 Sonbhad in UP is a very poor area
 yahaan ke chaatr kaa centre mohali padegaa to ve 1500 se 2000 kaa karch nahin uthaa sakenge
 When the exam is online, then what is the point of giving the center from here to there

 You might not see Kareena Kapoor smoking in her upcoming film 'heroine' as the censor board has banned the actress' roaming scenes in the film's trailer before being cleared
 kendriya film pramann board (sibiefasi) ne film main dhumrapaan vaale sabhi drishyon ko dhundhala karne kaa faisla kiya he
 Regional Officer j of CBFC in Mumbai
 pi
 Singh said, 'we decided sometime ago not to show smoke scenes in the trailers
 aisa isliye he kyonki trailor main koi sanvaidhanik chetavanee nahin hoti
 The full film shows a constitutional warning after the beginning and interval
 chetavanee ke baad bhi dhumrapaan vaale drishy dhundhale hote hai

 madhya pradesh or chhattisgarh main bahujan samaaj party ke saath gathbandhan main congress ke chunaav ladane ke kayaason ke bich mayawati ne kaha he ki yah samjhauta tabhi sambhav he, jab unki party ko sammanjanak siten milengi
 There have been discussions in the political circles of Congress and BSP to contest elections for a long time
 congress kii taraf se bhi kai netaa sakaaratmak bayaan de chuke hai
 However, nothing concrete has come out yet officially
 is bich, mayawati ne mangalvaar ko do took kaha, 'madhya pradesh, rajasthan or chhattisgarh main congress ke saath samjhauta tabhi sambhav he jab basapa ko sammanjanak siten milengi, agar is samjhaute mensammanjanak sitennhin milti hai to bhi unki party akele ladane ko puri tarah taiyaar he
 Mayawati wants a 'strong' not 'forced' government at the center, in a statement announcing the seats, Mayawati said that Congress leaders are making statements about seats and alliances which are completely wrong
 gathbandhan tabhi sambhav he jab basapa ko in rajyon main sammanjanak siten milengi
 Significantly, Assembly elections are going to be held in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh
 is babat congress samaan vichaar vaale raajnneetik dalon ke saath gathbandhan kii kavayad kar rahi he
 But Congress leader Sachin Pilot has spoken about contesting assembly elections alone in Rajasthan
 lekin congress madhya pradesh or chhattisgarh main bijepi ko rokane ke liye basapa ke saath maidan main utarane kii baat kahati rahi he
 In such a situation, Mayawati's latest statement especially matters
 disambar 2013 main lokapal kanoon ban gaya lekin 2017 aa gaya, lokapal koun he, iskaa zikr na banking sarvice chronical main milegaa na hi pratiyogita darpan main kyonki lokapal bana hi nahin he
 After all, the law that made such a huge movement, why Lokpal was not formed after that law was made, why did not the Lokpal structure be formed
 is sawaal par supreme court main sunwaayee puri hui he, faisla surakshit he
 The Lok Sabha does not have a Leader of the Opposition and the Lokpal cannot be appointed without the Leader of the Opposition according to the Lokpal Act
 to zaahir he ise lekar kanoon main sanshodhan karnaa hoga
 The amendments of all the other laws are passed in a jolt, what is the difficulty in the 20 amendments of the Lokpal Act, it is taking so long
 supreme court main sarkaar ne kaha he ki lokapal kii niyukti vartmaan halaat main sambhav nahin he
 There are many amendments which are pending in Parliament
 monsoon satr main in sanshodhano ke paas hone kii ummid he
 Overall, without the Lokpal itself, the certificate of freedom of corruption is being distributed
 do saal tak lokapal ko bhrashtachar ke kaph syrup ke rup main pesh kiya gaya magar chaar saal se isaki koi sud hi nahin le rahaa he
 The Finance Bill was passed in the Lok Sabha much faster and the opposition kept on watching
 is sanshodhan main raajnneetik dalon ne apane liye karporate chande kaa badhiya intazaam kar liya he
 Do not think that the government has made Aadhaar number mandatory to donate to political parties
 vahaan to chanda dene waalon kii pahchaan gupt rakhane kaa itnaa acha prayaas kiya gaya he ki puuchhiye mat
 Before the amendment is passed in the Lok Sabha, any company can give seven and a half percent of its total profits to political parties as donations
 company ko apane bahikhate main bataanaa hota tha ki kitna paisa raajnneetik dal ko diya
 Which political party has been given, it also had to be told
 tippaniyan Perhaps you will call it transparency as to who knows what transactions are happening between
 magar ab paardarshita kaa nayaa matlab laanch hua he
 According to the new amendment, companies will no longer have to tell which political party they have donated
 ab aap hi hindi kii class main master sahab se puch len ki paardarshita kya hui
 Telling is transparency or hiding is transparency
 yahi nahin, aap bainkon se elactoral band kharidenge, wo band kisi dal ko chalaa jayega
 It is not clear whether the name of the bond purchasers will remain secret or can be made public
 nae sanshodhan ke anusaar karporate ab kul munaafe kaa saadhe saat fisadi se bhi adhik chanda de sakate hai
 That is, the limit of giving up to seven and a half percent has been abolished
 pehle bataanaa padataa tha ki kise chanda diya, ab nahin bataanaa hoga
 What is the point of hiding it to whom it is to be given by check or electronic means? khaskar tab jab har kism kii len dein kaa pataa lagane ke liye sarkaar aadhaar number ko anivaary yaa zaruri karti chali ja rahi he
 Now a question is with you
 raajnneetik dal chanda dene waalon ko kyon yah suvidha dena chaahate hai ki aap kise chanda rahe hai yah pataa nahin chalegaa
 First, there was no need to mention the names of those giving less than 20,000
 ab ise ghataakar 2000 kar diya gaya he
 Questions still arose but people felt that if something is happening then good expectation should be given
 lekin nayaa sanshodhan kya raajnneetik dalon ke chande ko paardarshee banaata he
 Why PAN number, Aadhaar number is not mandatory here? Why political parties do not give even the PAN number of donors and nothing happens to them
 kya aapane sochaa he ki agar koi company apane munaafe kaa kuch bhi hissaa chande ke rup main ek raajnneetik dal ko dene lage to uske kya khatre honge? kya aap bilkul hi nahin jaananaa chahenge ki kis company ne chanda diya he?

 Farah Khan Ali is very active on social media and on the occasion of Lok Sabha elections 2019, she is constantly giving her opinion on electoral enthusiasts

 lekin ve apni baat kehane se chookti nahin hai
 Farah Khan, the daughter of jewelery designer and Bollywood actor Sanjay Khan, has commented on Ambani Hospital in Mumbai and said that there is nothing showing only PM Narendra Modi (PM Narender Modi) on TV there
 
 My friend who is admitted in Ambani hospital in Mumbai commented that all d channels the hospital subscribed to, only showed Modi
 She found it odd that not 1 channel of the 1s subscribed showed the Opposition
 So when BJP says media is bought they should know as they probably didparaha khan ali (farah Khan Ali) ne twit karke piem narendra (PM Narendra Modi) ko lekar ambani aspataal main chal rahe prachaar kii baat kahi he
 Farah Khan wrote: 'my friend was admitted to Ambani Hospital in Mumbai
 He told that all the channels the hospital has subscribed to are showing only to Modi
 usko hairat he ki sabskrib kiye gaye channelon main se ek main bhi vipaksh ko nahin dikhaaya ja rahaa he
 So when BJP says that media can be bought, they should know that they did as they did
 'saying that i should also add that the Kokilaben Ambani hospital in Mumbai is the best in terms of medical service and doctors
 And no I'm not getting paid to say this
 farah khan ali (farah Khan Ali) kokilaben aspataal ko lekar ek twit or bhi kiya he or likhaa haih 'iske saath hi main kahana chaahuungi ki mumbai kaa kokilaben aspataal medical sarvice or doctoron ke maamle main best he
 And i am not getting the money to say this
 ' is tarah farah khan ne ek baar phir apni baat bahut hi bebaaki ke saath kahi he

 "" Exactly a year ago, the biggest terrorist attack took place on Mumbai
 pakistan se aae 10 aatankwaadiyon ne mumbai main chode the khauf ke 10 nishaan
 Terrorists played bloody games at 10 places including Hotel Taj, Oberoi, CST, Leopold Cafe, Nariman House
 dehshatgardon ne jo khooni khel khelaa tha, uske jakhm aaj bhi kai logon ke dilon main maujuud hai
 The biggest terrorist attack took place on 26 November 2008 on Shaan Taj of Mumbai
 mehmaanon se gulzaar rahane vaala taj 39 logon kaa katlgaah ban gaya tha
 In the Taj's heritage building, terrorists Abdul Rehman Bada, Abu Naseer, Abu Shoaib and Abu Umar created a fierce furore
 taj ke gumbadon ko aag ke hawaale kar diya gaya tha or eke 47 se goliyaan dagkar puure hotel ko tahas nahas kar diya tha
 If the dining area was also badly destroyed, the pool side portion was also destroyed by the grenade blast
 ground floor par sthit horbar haul ko bhi aakhri bache aatankiyon ne goliyaan barasaakar tahas nahas kar diya
 The sixth floor of the Taj was made a stronghold by the terrorists
 yahaan ke saare kamaron main aatankiyon ne laashon ke dher laga die the
 The unsurpassed paintings, furniture, furnishings in the rooms were all burnt to ashes
 jahaan hameshaa ranginiyaan rahati thim, vahaan laashen bichhi thim
 The walls were adorned with paintings, there were bullets and bloodstains
 lekin, kehete hai naa taj kabhi girte nahin
 Taj never dies
 khaufnak hamalon ke baad taj ek baar phir uth khadaa he
 Every wound of the crown was closely applied
 deevaaren jo barbaad ho gayi thim, unhen thik kiya gaya
 The devastation on the stairs was also erased
 aatank ne jo andhergardi machaai thi, use phir se roshan kiya gaya
 The attack on Taj was an attack on the pride of Mumbai, but the maximum slaughter was carried out by the terrorists at CST
 abu ismail or kasaab ne siasti par andhadhundh golibari kii
 The journey of life of 57 people waiting for the train ended here
 yah he dehshat kaa doosraa nishaan
 The terror attack on the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminal in Mumbai took place on the night of 26 November 2008
 sabase khoonkhaar aatankwaadi abu ismail or uskaa saathi ajmal aamir kasaab aitihaasik railway stesan vity par andhadhundh goliyaan barsaata ja rahaa tha
 The CST was panned to avoid bullets
 donon dehshatgard ghante bhar goliyaan chalaate rahe, lekin vahaan unhen koi rokane vaala nahin tha
 The death toll would have increased further if both the terrorists did not leave CST and turn to Girgaum Chowpatty
 isi dauraan girgaanv choupati par abu ismail maaraa gaya or kasaab pakadaa gaya
 One year has passed since 26 / 11
 train ke pahiyon kii tarah siasti main jindagi raftaar pakad chuki he
 The terrorists were fearless and came with complete preparation
 nariman house par yahudee parivaar par hamalaa usee kaa hissaa tha
 Here 5 innocent people were killed, but its terror reached the world
 puri dakshin mumbai main maut kii dehshat ne apana jaal bicha diya tha
 Bullets of gunfire and handgrenade blasts echoed in Nariman House
 vahaan jabardast firing chal rahi thi
 Bombs were being thrown from the building
 sabase hairaan karne vaali baat yah thi ki yah imaarat kahin se bhi aatankiyon kii hitalist main nahin thi
 Actually the Jewish religious organization used to run in this building, that's why the terrorists targeted it
 do aatanki yahaan 26 november kii raat ghuse the
 He kept on firing all night and all day and night of 27 November
 jab bhi baahar suraksha bal kii taraf se koi halchal hoti, to grenade phenk dete
 Their bosses were monitoring this in Pakistan
 aakhirkaar 28 november kii subah enesji commando ne morcha khol diya
 After getting off the helicopter, the commandos entered Nariman House and killed both the terrorists
 haalanki tab tak aatanki nariman house main 5 logon ko maut kii neend sula chuke the
 Little Mose survived a surprise in this attack
 nariman house ko aatankiyon ne jo jakhm die wo aaj bhi maujuud hai
 It was reminiscent of the attack when it was opened to media persons on the 26 / 11 anniversary
 farsh, diwaar, chat koi bhi jagah nahin bachi thi, jahaan goliyon ke nishaan naa hon
 Leopold Cafe was telling the full story of the panic after the 26 / 11 attack
 taj se bilkul sate leopold cafe 26 november, 2008 kii raat 40-45 mehmaanon se bharaa hua tha
 Around 9:30 pm, two terrorists started firing indiscriminately
 aatankwaadi berahami se goliyaan barasaa rahe the
 The entire café turned red with blood
 9 log is hamale main jaan gavaan baithe
 Both terrorists escaped by firing bullets
 26 / 11 kii yaad main tihaan aaj bhi goliyon ke nishaanon ko surakshit rakhaa gaya he
 To tell this, do not forget that scene of terror, because the spirit of fighting will be found by this
 mumbai khauf kii giraft main thi
 Terrorists fiercely murdered at Oberoi Hotel
 kul 34 log yahaan maare gaye
 Earlier, terrorists had created panic in Leopold Cafe adjacent to Taj
 yahaan jab aatanki hamalaa hua tha, us vakt kareeb 40 mehmaan vahaan maujuud the
 9 people were killed in the attack and the devastation was created by the attackers in just minutes
 26 november, 2008 kii wo raat aaj bhi daraati he
 Reminds me of that dreadful scene, how 2 terrorists had shaken 3 large areas of Mumbai
 pehle to kama aspataal ke paas 3 police afasaron kii hatya kar di, phir metro cinema ke paas se police kii hi gaadi uda lee or phir girgaanv choupati ke paas bhi machaaya koharaam
 Mumbai was shaking
 aatankwaadiyon kaa ek gut kama aspataal main ghusaa hua tha
 With black night and black intentions, 10 terrorists created a furore in Mumbai
 raat ke 11 bajkar 25 minute hue the
 Hemant Karkare, head of the anti-terrorism Squad, along with the police force reached Cama Hospital to eliminate the terrorists
 thodi der main hi edishnal kamishnar east rigen ashok kamte or inspector vijay salskar bhi karkare kii madad ke liye kama aspataal pahunch gaye
 Then began unending firing on both sides
 baahar is tarah police kaa gheraa banataa dekhakar andar ke aatankwaadi baukhala gaye
 They started running around while firing bullets
 bhaagate-bhaagate aatanki kama aspataal ke pichley get kii taraf aa gaye
 Kamte and Salaskar also followed them
 eke-47 se las aatankwaadi tabadatod goliyaan barasaa rahe the
 Karkare, Kamte and Salaskar were martyred with these bullets
 hairaan karanevaali baat yah he ki goliyaan barasaate hue 2 aatankwaadi metro cinema ke paas aa gaye
 These were Abu Ismail and Ajmal Kasab
 phir inhone vahiin se police kii gaadi chhini or usapar savaar hokar goliyaan barasaate hue bhaagane lage
 Both these terrorists were fleeing in the devastation, but ASI Tukaram Ombale, near Girgaum, gave his life and nabbed one of these Kasab alive
 oberoi hotel main dehshat machaane se pehle aatankiyon ne madhya mumbai ke majgaanv main taxi blast kiya tha
 3 people were killed in it
 usee kram main dehshatgardon ne viley parley main bhi taxi udayi thi, jahaan 2 log maare gaye the
 The terrorists had hatched every plot to destroy Mumbai that night

 ) (except for the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it is published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) Today, about 450 Hindu families who came to India from Pakistan were watching a special report of their colleague Aditi Rajput, who is currently taking shelter in Majnu Ka Tila, close to the interstate bus base of Delhi
 pakistan main bhedbhaav se tang hokar ye log bharat aae hai, or yaheen rahanaa chaahate hai, lekin inke paas na naukari he, na rahane-khaane kii vyavastha
 Even Delhi only has a visa, so cannot go outside Delhi
 vaise, in logon ne pradhanmantri narendra modi se madad kii guhaar kii he, or inaki pareshaani ke jald samaadhaan ke liye grahamantri rajnath singh 23 disambar ko 10 sanghathanon ke saath baithak karne vaale hai
 This story is not limited only to these Hindu families, because the number of Hindus who migrated from Pakistan to India are in millions
 varsh 1947 main jab bharat kaa vibhaajan hua, lakhon kii sankhya main hindu or musalamaanon ne dharm ke aadhaar par mulk badla
 Still there were some Muslims who remained in India, and some Hindus in Pakistan
 bharat ne hindu raashtra banane kii bajaae dharmanirpeksh rajya bananaa pasand kiya, taaki bharat main rahane vaale alpsankhyak khud ko asurakshit na samajhen, unhen samaan adhikaar milen or iske liye bharat ne apane samvidhan main dharm chunane kii swatantraaa ko moulik adhikaron kii suchi main sthaan diya he
 Before the partition of India, the number of Muslims was 10 percent of the total population of India, which has increased to about 15 percent today
 lekin pakistan main rahane vaale hinduon kii kismat bhartiya musalamaanon jaisi na tab thi, na aaj he
 About 96 percent of the Hindus settled in Pakistan live in Sindh province
 varsh 1956 main pakistan kaa samvidhan bana or pakistan pragatisheel or udaaravaadi vichaardhaaraon ko tyagkar islamic desh ban gaya, or tabhi se hinduon kaa vahaan rahanaa dushwaar ho gaya
 Whenever Pakistan used to have a front-page account of India, or communal riots in India, all the incidents would have to be suffered by the Hindus living in Pakistan
 chaahe vah bharat-paak yuddh rahaa ho, yaa ayodhya main vivaadit dhaanche kaa vidhwans, yaa gujarat main hue dange, pakistan ke hinduon ko vahaan kii sarkaar or avam ne apane gusse kaa nishaanaa banaaya
 The demolition of the disputed structure in Ayodhya in India on 6 December 1992 led to strong reactions against Hindus in Pakistan
 minurity rhite group international ke mutabik 2-8 disambar, 1992 ke dauraan pakistan main takreeban 120 hindu mandiron ko giraaya gaya
 From the dictatorship of zia-ul-haq to the atrocities of the Taliban, the lives of Pakistani Hindus have been scarce
 azaadi ke vakt pakistan main kul 428 mandir the, jinamein se ab sirf 26 hi bache hai
 Most Hindu temples in Pakistan have been demolished, or made into hotels
 pakistan ke neshnal kamishan for justise and pis kii varsh 2012 kii report ke mutabik 74 pratishat hindu mahilaayein yon shoshan kaa shikaar hoti hai
 According to the 2012 report of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, 20 to 25 Hindu girls are abducted every month in the Sindh province of Pakistan and forced to convert
 jab pakistan main jeene ke liye anukool sthiti nahin rahi to majabuuran hinduon ko badi sankhya main pakistan chhodana pad rahaa he
 According to the Pakistan Census (1951) Hindus were 22% of the total population of Pakistan, which decreased to 1 in the 1998 census
 6 fisadi rah gaye hai
 According to a report by the Human Rights Law Network, since the year 1965, about 1
25 lakh Pakistani Hindus have migrated to India
 vaise, jab pakistan main muslim hi surakshit nahin hai, to hinduon ke liye shikaayat kahaan karen
 
 
 The There are blasts not only in temples but also in mosques
 shiyaon or sunniyon ke bich aedin dange hote hai, so, aise main hinduon ke maanavadhikaron kii baat karnaa moorkhtapurna lagata he
 These families who have come to India have not yet received any support from any political party
 unka dosha itnaa he ki ve bharat aakar alpsankhyakon ke ganit se baahar ho jate hai
 The vote bank of any party cannot be formed
 in logon ko pakistan main alpsankhyak hone kaa dushprinaam bhugatna padaa or bharat main bahusankhyak hone kii vajah se rajnatik dalon kii udaseenta jhelni pad rahi he
 Broadly, the media also ignores him

 apni aakhri film 'kik' main salmaan khan kaa doylaag tha, 'hamaari police hameshaa let pahunchati he or galat insaan ko hi erest karti he
 But in the case of 'dabangg' Salman Khan, this dialogue proved to be wrong
 unhen 13 saal puraane 'hit and ran' maamle main doshi tehraaya gaya
 The 49-year-old actor, who was identified as a young man with his masculine style and scare on the 70mm golden screen, got watery when the judge gave an important verdict about him
 haalanki film main jab unhen kaid kii sajaa sunaayi jaati he tab ve khud ko ek sherdil jawan ke rup main pesh karte hai
 The court on Wednesday found him guilty of culpable homicide in the 2002 case and all other charges against him were proved
 haal ke varshon main salmaan ne apni filmon main insaaf ke yoddha ke kirdaar kii kala main maharath hasil kii he, lekin abhinayta ko asli jivan main kanoon ke duusare paale main dekhnaa ek badi bidambnaa rahi
 Whether he played the role of a policeman in the films 'garv', 'wanted' and 'dabangg' series, or in 'jai Ho' and 'kick' helping others or single-handedly tackling criminals, the actor made his mark in films This noble image has drawn a large number of fans
 chaahe lover bvoy kaa kirdaar ho yaa phir ection hero kaa, salmaan khan kii box-offis kii safalataa unke adhikansh samakalik abhinaytaon ke liye irshyaajanak rahaa he
 The comments vah bollywood ke sabase pasandida staron main ek hai lekin kuch baaten pareshaan karne vaali hai, kyonki vah parde ke baahar apni harkaton ko lekar aksar sukhiryon main rahe hai
 The court verdict is not favorable for the film industry, as the Rs 200 crore film projects are at stake on this superstar
 unki do agali filmein 'bajrangi bhaijan' or 'prem ratan dhan payo' philhal shooting ke charan main he
 Salman is also facing a court hearing in Rajasthan for hunting black deer during the shooting of 1998 film Hum Saath Saath Hain
 70 mem ke sunahare parde par apane mardaana andaaj or nahin daraane vaale yuva ke rup main pahachaane jane vaale 49 varshiya abhinayta kii ankhon main tab pani aa gaya, jab jaj ne unke bare main mahatvapurn faisla sunaaya
 However, when he is sentenced to prison in the film, he presents himself as a sherdil jawan
 adaalat ne buudhvaar ko unhen varsh 2002 ke maamle main gaiyr iradatan hatya kaa doshi paaya evam unke viruddh anya sabhi aarope sabit hue
 In recent years, Salman has mastered the art of playing a warrior of justice in his films, but seeing the actor in the second half of the law in real life has been a major irony
 chaahe film 'garv', 'wanted' or 'dabang' siries main unka pulisavaale kaa kirdaar ho yaa phir 'jai ho' or 'kik' main dusron kii madad karne vaale yaa akele hi aparaadhiyon se nibatane vaali bhoomika, abhinayta ne filmon main apni is nek chhavi se badi sankhya main prashansak banaae hai
 Be it Lover Boy or Action Hero, Salman Khan's box-office success has been the envy of most of his contemporary actors
 tippaniyan He is one of the most favorite stars of Bollywood, but some things are disturbing, as he has often been in the beauty of his antics outside the screen
 adaalat kaa faisla filmodyog ke liye anukool nahin he, kyonki 200 karod rupee kii film pariyojnaayen is superstar par daanv par lag gai hai
 His two next films 'bajrangi Bhaijaan' and 'prem Ratan Dhan Payo' are currently in the shooting phase
 salmaan 1998 main film 'ham saath saath hai' kii shooting ke dauraan kaale hiran kaa shikaar karne ko lekar rajasthan main bhi adalati sunwaayee kaa saamana kar rahe hai

 Samajwadi Party patron Mulayam Singh Yadav says that he is campaigning for the party in UP wholeheartedly
 mulaayam kii maane to party ke andar jo vivaad tha wo ab khatm ho chukaa he or sabhi ekajute hokar chunaav lard rahe hai
 In a special conversation with Aaj Tak for the first time after the family-friendly controversy, Akhilesh said that Akhilesh has done a good job in the state
 lekin saath hi unhone kaha ki agar wo akhilesh ko mukhyamantri nahin banaate to wo kabhi siem nahin ban pate
 Perhaps, Mulayam's statement also carries a message to Akhilesh
 piem modi par vaadakhilaphi kaa aropapiem modi par hamalaa karte hue mulaayam ne kaha ki unhone logon se bade-bade vaade kiye jo abhi tak puure nahin hue
 Because of this, there is resentment among the people
 jabaki mayawati ke bare main unhone kuch bhi bolne se inkaar kar diya
 Talking to Netaji 'aaj Tak' on alliances with Congress, Mulayam admitted that due to controversy within the party in the past, he got separated and some people joined the other party due to not getting tickets
 mulaayam kii maane to sapa or congress ke gathbandhan se unki party ko kam phayda hoga jabaki congress ko isse zyada phayda milane vaala he

 isisi cricket world kapaketisare quarter finalmen pakistan or australia ke bich match shuukravaar ko khelaa janaa he
 In this match, even though Australia is considered a strong contender for victory, Pakistan cannot be taken lightly
 ham aapako paanch aisi vajahen bataa rahe hai ki kyon pakistan ye match apane naam karegaa or semifinal main jagah banayega
 Friday's' pher'pakistan has a psychological effect on the opposing team whenever they get down to play on Friday
 shuukravaar jumme kaa din hota he or is din pakistan ko haraana hameshaa se mushkil rahaa he
 Talking about the World Cup, Pakistan has played 70 World Cup matches so far, of which 40 have been won and 28 have been lost while the result of two matches has not happened
 is dauraan chaar baar aisa hua he ki match shuukravaar ko hue
 Out of these four, Pakistan has lost only once
 shuukravaar ko pehali baar world cap main pakistan 1987 main khelaa tha
 In this match played against West Indies on 16 October, Pakistan had won an exciting 1-wicket win
 pakistan ne ye match haarate haarate jeeta tha
 At that time it was difficult for any team to defeat the West Indies
 iske baad haalanki westeindies ne kuch din baad hi pakistan ko shuukravaar ke din hi haraaya tha
 But that was the only occasion when Pakistan lost in the World Cup on Friday
 iske baad 1999 world cap main pakistan ne do match shuukravaar ko khele or donon hi jite
 On 28 May, Pakistan defeated New Zealand by 62 runs and then Zimbabwe by 148 runs
 shuukravaar ko pakistani cricket kaa din maanate hai
 The difference of ground and sky in the confidences of both the players is that they can play the best cricket
 maine pehle bhi dekha he lekin ve apane pairon par kulhadi bhi utani hi teji se maarthe hai
 This is why the Pakistani team is so dangerous, especially in knockout matches
 unke paas kuch match vinar hai or ek baar form main aane par unhen rokna mushkil hota he
 'shane Watson, Australian all-rounder' i think the pressure will be on him, so we will try to increase it by playing positive cricket
 australia ke khilaaf hamaare match hameshaa kareebi rahe hai
 We beat him in the Test series in the UAE
 hamaare paas bhi baayen haath ke teen tej gendbaaj he lihaaja ham unki madad se taiyaari kar rahe hai
 Australia's fast bowling attack is strong but our preparation is also strong
 ’sarfaraj ahamed, pakistani ballebazworld cap main 'head tu head'australia ne pakistan ke khilaaf 92 main se 57 match jite hai jabaki 31 baar hi pakistan jeet paaya he
 But the World Cup is a quarter-final, so it should also be the World Cup
 world cap main donon timen 8 baar bhidi hai or donon ne hi chaar chaar match jite hai
 Pakistan has won against Australia in 1979, 1992, 1999 and 2011
 2003 ke baad se australia world cap main pakistan se jeet nahin sakaa he
 Both the teams did not play in 2007 while Pakistan won in 2011
 ab ise dekhakar ye kahana galat nahin hoga ki kangaaroon ko pakistan se sanbhal kar rahanaa hoga
 In the current World Cup, the graph of the two teams, based on the performance in this World Cup, the graph of the Pakistani team has gone up from the bottom while the graph of Australia has come down from the top
 pakistan ne shuruaati do match ganvaane ke baad dakshin africa samet zimbabwe, yuai or ireland ko badi hi aasaani se haraaya
 Pakistan has shown an aggressive attack
 aise main australia kii mushkilen or bad sakati hai
 Australia may have lost one match in the league round but have had to struggle to win
 australia ko srilanka or scotland ne acchhee takkar di thi
 So Pakistan's rising and Australia's falling graph also goes in Pakistan's favor
 khilaadiyon kaa pradarshanis world cap main sabase zyada ran banane vaale khilaadiyon kii list main ek bhi australian ballebaaj shaamil nahin he
 Pakistan captain misbah-ul-haq is at number eight in this list

 However, Pakistan's position in batting is also similar
 gendbaaji kii baat karen to australian tej gendbaaj mishael stark ke alaava or koi bhi gendbaaj kuch zyada prabhavit nahin kar sakaa he
 While Wahab Riaz, Sohail Khan bowled brilliantly for Pakistan

 maanjhi ne somvaar ko modi sarkaar par aarope lagaae ki rajya ko vishesh darja dene ko lekar vah gambhir nahin he or is maamle main vah sirf raajnneeti kar rahi he
 His statement came after the remarks of Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan in which Paswan said that Bihar will enter the special state only after the NDA comes to power
 maanjhi ne patrakaron se poocha, ‘agar aisa he to narendra modi ne sansadeey chunaavon ke prachaar main kyon vaada kiya ki agar vah satta main aate hai to bihar ko vishesh rajya kaa darja, or vishesh package diya jayega
 Paswan, president of Lok Janshakti Party, an ally of the BJP, had said on Monday that Bihar would be accorded special state status if the NDA comes to power and creates suitable conditions in the assembly elections next year
 nitish kumaar ke haal ke ‘sampark yatra’ ke dauraan vishesh darja ke mudde ko uthaae jane ke jawaab mempaswaanne kaha tha, ‘agar darja de bhi diya jaataa he to iskaa koi matlab nahin he kyonki jadyu sarkaar, rajya main iske liye aadharbhoot dhaancha viksit karne main vifal rahi he
 Attacking Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Manjhi said, "on the basis of hollow promises, he won the Lok Sabha elections in Bihar and is now doing the same in Jharkhand
" ’ darasal maanjhi 'janata ke darbar main mukhyamantri’ kaarykram main shirkat kar rahe the
 Meanwhile, Manjhi said that JDU under the leadership of former Chief Minister Nitish Kumar was fighting seriously for special status and whether the BJP will support it or not, the party will get it
 bihar ke mukhyamantri ne kaha ki uttari rajyon ke mukhyamantriyon kii dilli main saat disambar ko pradhanmantri dwaara bulaai gai baithak main vah vishesh darje ke mudde ko pramukhataa se uthaaenge

 In the last 48 hours, three such incidents of assault on women have come to light, which have exposed the negligence of Delhi Police
 teenon hi maamalon main hamalavar kaaphi samay se mahilaon ko pareshaan kar rahe the
 The police was also aware of this
 lekin dilli police ne samjhaute kii aad main apni bhalaa ko taal diya
 As a result, two women lost their lives
 pehla maamaladilli ke buraadi main karunaa ko jis berahami se katl kiya gaya, use dekhakar dilliwaalon ke hosh phakhta ho gaye
 On Tuesday, 34-year-old Surendra, near Labor Chowk, shot 22 with scissors at 21-year-old Karuna and brutally slaughtered him on the road
 is dauraan karunaa kii chacheri bahan neha bhi uske saath thi
 She kept shouting for help but no one came to stop Surendra
 koi soch bhi nahin saktaa tha ki surendra naamak vyakti apni mashooqa ko saream is tarah se katl kar degaa
 Both knew each other since 2012
 donon ke bich sambandh bhi rahe
 But Karuna later distanced himself from Surendra
 is bich vah use pareshaan karata rahaa
 About 6 months ago, Karuna's family members complained to the police
 magar police ne mukadmaa likhane ke bajaay donon pakshon main samjhauta kara kar khanaapurti kar di
 As a result, Karuna was put to death
 doosraa maamlaburadi hatyakand se pehle south-west dilli ke indrapuri main bhi ek aisi hi khaufnak vaardaat ko anjaam diya gaya
 Where a married woman named Lakshmi was adopted with a Sarerah knife
 is vaardaat ko anjaam diya 30 varshiya sanjay kumaar naam ke shaks ne
 When Lakshmi was returning from her work, he stopped her on the way and started trying to talk to her
 lakshmi ne jab use inkaar kiya to sanjay ne aapa kho diya or chaaku nikaal kar ek ke baad ek lakshmi ke pet par waar kiye
 Lakshmi fell there, bled
 jab use aspataal le jaaya gaya doctoron ne use mrit ghoshit kar diya
 Actually Sanjay Kumar had been harassing Lakshmi for the last one and a half years
 is sambandh main lakshmi ke pati ne police ko 3 janvari 2015 or 2 octubar 2015 ko shikaayat darj karai thi lekin police ne yahaan bhi aaropee ke khilaaf karrwai karne ke bajaay samjhauta karaayaa or apni jimmedaari se haath dho liya
 The brunt of which Lakshmi had to pay her own life
 teesraa maamaladilli ke mongolpuri ilaake main rahane vaali 21 saal kii wo ladki peshey se beautisian he
 About a year and a half ago, he became friends with Amit, a resident of Rohtak, Haryana, on Facebook
 iske baad donon ke bich whatsap par chating hone lagi
 Then one day that young man named Amit proposed marriage to the girl, but the girl refused him
 iske baad ladki ne us ladke se duuri bana lee
 On Tuesday evening, Amit, along with his elder sister and a boy, reached the girl's house and forcibly married her
 ladki ne phir manaa kar diya to vah ladki se ek lakh rupee kii maang karne laga
 After refusing, Amit along with his sister threw the girl down from the balcony of the house
 teen manzil se neeche girakar ladki ke haath, paanv or munh main fracture ho gaya
 However, the people caught the accused and his sister and handed them over to the police
 is maamle main bhi police ko pehle shikaayat kii gai thi, lekin police ne laaparvaahee dikhaate hue karrwai kaa aashwaasan dekar pallaa jhaad liya tha
 Because of which that girl reached this condition today
 
 
 
 If two lives are saved, the Delhi Police may claim the honor and safety of women, but the reality has been exposed to all these three incidents
 police ne teenon shikayaton ko gambhirtha se lene kii bajaay apni jaan chhudaane kii koshish kii
 And instead of taking strict steps against the accused, he insisted on compromise
 agar police ne apni jimmedaari nibhaate hue aropiyon ke khilaaf karrwai kii hoti to shaayad aaj karunaa or lakshmi jinda hotin

 bhartiya rigerv bank (arabiai) kii dwimasik maudrik niti samiksha se pehle vitt mantri arun jetali ko ummid he kibyaj dar main katautee hogi
 Jaitley said on Sunday that Governor Raghuram Rajanse is expected to reduce the policy interest rate as is usually done
 2 june ko hone vaali dwimasik samiksha se apni ummid ke bare main unhone kaha, ‘meri apeksha vahi he, jo aapaki he
 So far in 2015, the RBI has cut its policy interest rate twice

 The rate at which RBI lends cash to banks is called repo rate
 vahiin bainkon kii ore se kendriya bankke paas jamaa paison kaa jo hissaa rakhana hota he, use siaraar kaha jaataa he
 These reasons may result in rate cuts — a softening of inflation and a lower-than-expected rise suggest that further policy rates may be cut, —even less than the monsoon poses a risk of affecting crop production , - Retail inflation 4-month low in April 4

 loksabhaa main congress or sipiem saansadon ne mob linching ke mudde par hangaamaa kiya
 As soon as the Lok Sabha proceedings started at 11 am on Thursday, Congress and CPM mps started shouting slogans as Minister of State for Aviation Jayant Sinha stood up to give his answer
 unhone naare lagaae ki "jail janaa band karo, aparaadhiyon ko maala bananaa band karo'
 Congress and CPM mps did not allow Jayant Sinha to speak in the House
 iske baad jab prashnkaal khatm hua to shunya kaal main bhi ek baar phir congress ne is mudde ko uthaaya
 Congress MP KC Venugopal criticized the government on the issue saying that not only the people of the opposition are being targeted but the minister in the government Sushma Swaraj was also recently trolled in social media
 congress saansad ke si venugopal ne aage kaha ki is mudde par pradhanmantri bhi khamosh hai
 Amid the uproar, Home Minister Rajnath Singh said that incidents of mob lynching are unfortunate
 aisi ghatnaayen pehle bhi hoti rahi hai
 State governments should take strong action on this issue
 kanoon vyavastha rajya kaa mudda he
 Rajnath Singh further said, 'the Ministry of Home Affairs issued advisory on this issue twice

 Due to the way fake news is spread through social media, such incidents happen

 Former Congress MP Rajesh Mishra has expressed his inability to join the advisory committee

 After this, Salman Khurshid gave the statement 'rahul Gandhi has gone', which is seen as a big setback for the state Congress
 varanasi se saansad rah chuke rajesh mishra pradesh main congress ke pramukh brahman cheharaa hai
 Sources close to him said that he was unhappy with the relatively less experienced Ajay Kumar Lallu being appointed as the state unit president of the Congress

 Every possible effort to form a government in Maharashtra continued; ncp-congress did not open support to Shiv Sena
 Maharashtra was a political drama on Monday night
 dopaher main aasaani se shivasena-congress-ensipi sarkaar banaati dikh rahi thi, lekin shaam hote-hote sthitiyaan aisi badalin ki shivasena khud ko thaga sa mahasoos karne lagi
 The Shiv Sena asked the governor for a 48-hour extension, which was rejected
 iske baad ensipi se rajyapal ne sarkaar banane ke liye poocha
 For this, he too has got 24 hours
 is avadhi ke biit jane ke baad rajya main raashtrapati shashan lagane ke asaar hai
 The Shiv Sena is currently making every effort to form a government

 After this, Aditya Thackeray said that Shiv Sena leaders told the governor that they wanted to form the government
 unhone do dinon kaa samay maanga tha lekin itnaa vakt rajyapal ne nahin diya
 However, the governor did not reject his claim to form the government
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki donon partiyaan (congress or ensipi) kii hamase baatcheet chal rahi he
 But Shiv Sena seems to be stuck in power
 maharashtra vidhansabha chunaav ke nateezon main bijepi ke baad duusari sabase badi party banakar ubhari shivasena ko jhatka congress or ensipi donon kii ore se laga
 Both Congress and NCP have not supported Shiv Sena till now
 congress ne koi press conference nahin kii
 Separation from Shiv Sena in Maharashtra, not a loss for BJP, a press note was issued by the Saudaparty, which said that the Congress Working Committee met today, in which talks with state Congress leaders about the state of Maharashtra 
 iske baad congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ne ensipi chif sharad pavaar se baachatit kii
 At present, the Congress is engaged in talks with the NCP and only then a decision will be taken

 If the Shiv Sena could not hand over the letter of support to the Governor within a certain time, the Governor would think of another option
 inamen se ekarashtrapati shashanbhi he
 Many questions arise about the NCP and Congress not yet handing over letters of support to the Shiv Sena
 pehle khabar yah bhi ai thi ki congress baahar se shivasena ko samarthan degi lekin baad main congress ke press note se yah khabar afvaah sabit ho gai
 The NCP and Congress have not opened the cards yet to go with the Shiv Sena
 congress netaa or purv mukhyamantri prithviraj chavaan ne sidhe taur par is raajnneetik ghatnakram par kuch bhi kehane se inkaar kar diya
 The Shiv Sena seems to be stuck in the midst of the tussle between these two parties and the wait seems to be stretching

 balki ye report dekhakar yaa padhakar chunaav ladane vaale log hans bhi rahe honge ki ye koun si nai baat bataa rahaa he
 The Election Commission these days has started to tighten the money and also recover crores of rupees, but no one can say with a claim that the money is not divided in the election
 agar hamaara matadaata is tarah rishwatkhor ho jayega to loktantr kaa bhavishya kya hoga
 Often, on the day of the result, we keep cheating on someone's victory that such and such history has made history
 falaan itihaas ban gaye lekin kya ye sahi tasviir he
 Does this report relating to the two legislatures not make the entire Tamil Nadu election suspicious? chunaav ayog ke is faisle kii khub tarif ho rahi he, bilkul honi chahie lekin kya ham aashwast hai ki ye kahani sirf do vidhansabha kshetron main hi ghati hogi
 If not, do you not feel cheated or do you mind
 haalat yah thi ki ek baar chunaav radd hone ke baad bhi in do vidhansabha kshetron main paise baantne kii shikaayat mili or paise zabt kiye gaye
 4 crore 77 lakh cash was recovered by raiding a gentleman in Aravakuchi assembly
 jiske yahaan chapa padaa wo jayalalita kii party ke ummidavaar kaa kareebi tha
 The candidate has held key positions in Jayalalithaa's government
 dastavezon se pataa chalaa ki 1 karod 30 lakh kii sari or dhoti banti ja chuki he
 Several note counting machines have also been recovered
 kul milakar alag alag chhaapon main 8 karod se adhik kii raashi baraamad kii gai
 The comments ek or vidhansabha he thanjavur
 Here too, on the complaint of someone, a lodge was raided
 loj ke terres par paanch lakh rupaya padaa mila
 There was a lot of rubber band scattered in the bundles of notes
 haath se likhaa chaar pannon kaa ek note mila jiske chauthe panne ke kone par 35 lakh likhaa tha
 When the lodge owner raided another lodge, he got 1
5 million from there
 13 ward main ek karod 40 lakh baantne ke note mili
 Thanjavur has 51 wards
 51 main se 13 ward main paise bantane ke pramaan yaa sanket mili hai
 Does the address have money distributed in all the wards? ek ummidavaar ne yahaan 6 karod rupee baante hai
 The team made by the Commission worked hard but only 21 lakh could be confiscated
 yahi nahin diemke ke ummidaar ne thanjavur vidhansabha ke sthaneey mandiron ko 5 lakh se lekar 50 lakh rupee daan diye taaki ve mandal bana saken
 That is, in this game, bribes were also given in the name of gods and goddesses
 matadaataaon ko token diya gaya ki chunaav ke baad falaan dukaan se washing mashin le len
 This decision will surely send a strong message, but can any action be taken against the voters who took the money
 saadiyaan lee or token liye
 When taking and giving bribe is both a crime then how is the voter being missed
 yahi nahin jab chunaav radd hue to tamilnadu ke rajyapal ke rosaiyya ne ayog ko patr likhaa ki chunaav nahin taalna chahie
 The Commission clearly stated that the Governor should have avoided writing such letters
 chunaav ayog ne ek lambii report jari kii he ki kis tarah se tamilnadu ke do vidhansabhaon main chunaav jeetne ke liye jayalalita or karunanidhi kii party ne karodon rupee baant diye
 Elections to both these assemblies were canceled twice and are due to be held on June 13
 puure chunaav ke dauraan hamane menifeston se lekar ummidavaaron ke paise baantne kii khabaren dekhi
 How the leaders are taking votes in the name of distributing household items when they come into government, but a better administered and educated state could not argue about this risk
 dalon ke prati matadaata kii nishtha is kadar sthaayee ban chuki he ki wo iske aage peeche dekhnaa hi nahin chahta
 The Election Commission has written in its report that the facts of all the things have not been found, but it is known that from 2000 to 5000 rupees have been distributed to every voter
 yah sawaal aap matadaataaon se bhi he ki kya aap vaaki paise lekar vot karte hai
 Do you know how you are risking your future instead of 2000? koun yah baat nahin jaanata he ki chunaavon main paise baante jate hai
 Rather, people watching these reports or reading the election must have been laughing about what new thing it is telling
 chunaav ayog in dinon zarur paison ko lekar sakhti karne laga he or karodon rupee baraamad bhi kar letaa he lekin koi daawey ke saath nahin kah saktaa ki chunaav main paise nahin bante hai
 If our voter becomes a bribe in this way, then what will be the future of democracy
 akasar nattejey ke din kisi kii jeet par ham chaati dhunate rahete hai ki falaan ne itihaas rach diya
 So much has become history, but is this the right picture? kya do vidhansabhaon se sambandhit ye report puure taminladu ke chunaav ko sandigdh nahin karti he
 This decision of the Election Commission is being highly appreciated, it should happen at all, but are we sure that this story will happen in only two assembly constituencies
 agar nahin to kya aap thage se mahasoos nahin kar rahe yaa aapako koi fark hi nahin padataa
 The situation was that even after the election was canceled, there were complaints of money being distributed in these two assembly constituencies and the money was seized
 aravakuchi vidhansabha main ek sajjan ke yahaan chaape maar kar 4 karod 77 lakh nakad baraamad kiya gaya
 The one who was raided here was close to Jayalalithaa's party candidate
 ummidavaar jayalalita kii sarkaar main mahatvapurn padon par rahaa he
 Documents showed that 1 crore 30 lakh saris and dhotis have been distributed
 note ginaney kii kai mashine bhi baraamad kii gai hai
 In all, more than 8 crore was recovered in different raids
 tippaniyan Another assembly is Thanjavur
 yahaan bhi kisi kii shikaayat par ek loj main chapa maaraa gaya
 Five lakh rupees were found lying on the terrace of the lodge
 noton kii gaddiyon main lagane vaala khub sara rabar band bikharaa hua tha
 a four-page note written by hand was found with 35 lakhs written on the corner of the fourth page
 loj ke maalik ke ek duusare loj par chapa padaa to vahaan se 15 lakh mila
 In 13 wards, notes of distributing one crore 40 lakhs were found
 thanjavur main 51 ward hai
 In 13 wards out of 51, there is evidence or indication of money splitting
 kya pataa sabhi ward main paise bante hon
 a candidate has distributed Rs 6 crore here
 ayog kii banaai team ne khub mehnat kii lekin 21 lakh hi zabt kar saki
 Not only this, the DMK candidate donated 5 lakh to 50 lakh rupees to the local temples of Thanjavur Assembly so that they could form mandalas
 yani is khel main devi devataaon ke naam par bhi rishwat di gai
 Voters were given tokens that after the election such and such as take a washing machine from the shop
 is faisle se zarur kadaa sandesh jayega lekin kya un matadaataaon ke khilaaf koi karrwai ho sakati he jinhone paise liye
 Took saris and took tokens
 jab rishwat lenaa or dena donon aparaadh he to matadaata kaise chhot ja rahaa he
 Not only this, when the elections were canceled, Tamil Nadu Governor k Rosaiah wrote a letter to the Commission that elections should not be postponed
 ayog ne saaf saaf kah diya ki garvanar ko aise patr likhane se bachanaa chahie tha

 India is in the process of shutting down other hosting websites including torrent websites in the name of stopping piracy

 The RJD supremo and former railway minister Lalu Prasad termed it as a crime against the people of the country for not holding it responsible for holding the Congress government and the state governments at the center for inflation
 patna sthit rajd ke pradesh mukhyalay main party ke rashtriya adhyaksh pad ke liye shanivaar ko apana namakan daakhil karne ke baad patrakaron ko sambodhit karte hue lalu ne desh main mahangaai ke liye centre kii congress sarkaar or pradesh sarkaron ko jimmedaar tehraate hue isapar roak nahin lagaae jane ko desh kii janata ke prati aparaadh kii sangya di
 He said that inflation has caused chaos all around and it is not taking the name of stopping
 chini kii keemat 50 rupee pratikilo ho gayi he
 There is also talk of shortage of pulses, rice, wheat, flour, factory made goods, milk
 lalu ne kaha ki pradesh sarkaar dwaara upmukhyamantri susheel kumaar modi ke netritv main mahangaai or kalabazari or jamkhori par roak lagane ke liye mantrimandal kii upasmiti kaa gathan kiya he par abtak kalabazari or jamkhori karne vaale kisi bhi vyakti ke khilaaf karrwai nahin hui he

 na hi yahaan maujuud 25 saal ke yuva raghav handa ko dekhakar yah pataa chalata he ki unki ungliyaan mobile par kisi game main nahin, balki hajaaron logon kii roji-roti main padane vaali adchanon ko khel-khel main dur karne main lagi hai
 The story starts with toys from e-rickshaws company OK Play, which is currently making miles and walking routes and is looking for a solution to solve the problem of business
 khilone banane vaali british company oke play ko rajan ke pita rajan handa ne 1989 main kharida tha
 Till 1992, the company only continued in the toy business
 1992 ke ant main company ne plastic ke kshetra main kaam shuru kiya
 The company started manufacturing quality plastic products and began supplying spare parts to trucks and automobile manufacturers
 fori taur par pehla navachaar plastic kaa ful tanks bananaa tha
 This experiment was successful
 lekin duusare udhyamiyon kii tarah raghav ke parivaar kii bhi lambii kahani he
 His grandfather-great-grandfather lived in Lahore and migrated to India after partition
 unke dada himachal main jaj the
 His father Rajan studied engineering from Punjab University
 phir aage kii padhai ke liye america chale gaye
 After coming from there, he started his work here and bought toy maker OK Play and created history
 rajan handa company ke pramukh hai
 Raghav and his twin brother Rishabh play different responsibility areas in the same
 raghav oparations or new product deveopment or rishabh cells tathaa marketing kaa kaam dekhte hai
 Both rarely get a chance to spend time with the family, but on meeting, they do meet elder sister Nandana and other members
 raghav padhai puri karne ke baad apni company main internship ke dauraan ek taraf kaam sikhte the to duusari taraf samasya or samaadhaan ke bich ke faasale ko vyavsaayik avasar ke rup main badalane kii sochaa karte the
 This thinking proved to be the turning point that inspired him to make a plastic e-rickshaw "king"
 ise 2015 main launch kiya gaya tha
 The idea behind Raja Rickshaws (e-rickshaws) was that one person on a rickshaw would avoid pulling another person
 raghav kehete hai, ''lekin yah moulik soch hamaari nahin he
 We prepared a package of how to overcome the problem of buying a rickshaw from running to driving
 " rickshaw jab tak chal rahaa he tabhi tak kamai hoti he
 Rickshaw buyers will not be able to pay installments on time if earnings stop
 lekin dikkat yahi nahin he
 1,16,000 Rs
 kaa ek rickshaw kharidne ke liye bank main kya kagajaat chahie, guaranter koun hoga, jaisi kai samasyaayein hai
 Raghav has also brought a solution for this
 unki company rickshaw kharidne vaale ko non banking finance sarvice (enbiensi) se lone dilaati he
 The guarantor is also the same
 raghav kehete hai, ''hamane ek centralined monitering unit taiyaar kii he
 The rickshaw which leaves from our show room is connected by GPS
 rickshaw kahaan chal rahaa he yaa rukaa he, yah pataa chalata he
 As soon as the rickshaw malfunction is detected, we immediately send the mechanic to the rickshaw on the bike
 " ise sarvice on bike kehete hai
 a special thing about Raja Rickshaw is that it is environmentally friendly
 chunki puraa rickshaw hi plastic se bana he isliye ise paint karne kii jarurat nahin hoti
 For this reason, the fear of pollution due to rickshaw is eliminated
 chunki is rickshaw main metal kaa prayog naam maatr kaa he isliye jang bhi nahin lagati or rickshaw kii aayu 10 saal se adhik hoti he
 Since India is aiming for a fully electric car by 2030, the company is working in this direction
 raja i-rickshaw ke alaava company ke anya utpaadon main i-vending cart, i-mobile shop, i-loder, i-garbej colector, i-skool bas or i-scooter hai
 The e-rickshaw weighs 320 kg and can carry 700 kg
 isaki adhiktam speed 24 kimi prati ghanta he or bydaree ek baar puri tarah charge ho jaae to 80 kimi tak chalati he
 This company can produce 20,000 more vehicles every year
 "oke play kii factoriyaan abhi ahmednagar (maharashtra), surat (gujarat), sohana (haryana), kurukshetra (haryana), raneepet (tamilnadu), kolkata (pashchim bengal) guvahati (assam) main hai
 Four more factories are to be set up
 prayek factory main har maheene 2,000 rickshaw banane kii kshamta he
 OK Play is set to bring plastic auto soon
 yah auto 50 kilometre kii speed se chal saktaa he
 Raghav believes that this will be a revolutionary change
 metal ke auto ke mukaable plastic ke auto na sirf vajan main halke honge balki isaki aayu bhi lambii hogi
 There will be no need to rust, paint, or repair the wear and tear
 ve kehete hai, ''ham jointles body vaala auto banane kii soch rahe hai
 "with change and innovation to solve problems, Raghav is preparing OK Play Vehicles to compete with many older companies

 Companies that took coal mines free of cost by taking advantage of political contacts and based on which they made uncountable profits from the increased prices of their shares have been fined
 ek badi baat yah hui he ki supreme court ne sieji report ke hisaab ko sahi mana he
 Former CAG Vinod Rai gave an account that companies who got coal mines would get a profit of Rs 295 per tonne of coal extracted
 is aadhaar par unhone ek lakh 86 hazaar karod ke nuksaan kaa anumaan bataaya tha
 At that time, the Congress Party and former Finance Minister Chidambaram used to say that there was zero loss
 court ne faisla diya he ki ab jo koyala nikaala jayega or pehle jo nikaala gaya he un sab par companiyon ko 295 rupee prati ton jurmaana dena hoga
 Between 1997 and 2014, about 31 million tonnes of coal have been extracted, on which the fine amount is around 9000 crores
 40 khadaanon ko agle chah maheene tak chaalu rahane kaa aadesh he un par bhi jurmaana lagegaa
 Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Justice RM Lodha, said in an August 25 judgment that these coal blocks were given arbitrarily

 The GST Council is going to have an important meeting on 10 March
 is baithak main ritern prakriya ko saral karne ke liye tamaam rajyon se suzav maange gaye hai
 Recently a two-day workshop was organized by the Delhi government, under which the tax department sought the suggestions of the traders
 aam aadmi party trade wing ke sanyojak brijesh goyal ne bataaya ki ye sabhi suzav upmukhyamantri manish sisodiya ko saunp die jaaenge, taaki 10 march ko hone vaali jiesti council kii meeting main dilli sarkaar inhen prastaavit kar sake
 According to Brijesh Goyal, there have been complaints from all over the country about the complicated process of GST returns
 yahi kaaran he ki jiesti council ne isamen sudhaar ke liye do kamitiyon iti cameti or ritern cameti kaa gathan karte hue do model taiyaar karwaae hai
 Suggestions sent by the Aam Aadmi Party Trade Wing- 1- Currently, invoice wise details are sought in the return, which is a long process
 hamaari maang he ki total vailu or credit ditels hi maangi jaaen
 2- a single return system should be created for tax payers, whether input tax or output tax
 thik vaisaa hi jaise waite main form 16 ke madhyam se liya jaataa tha
 Also, in case of a return mismatch, he is granted time to match and the traders can match him in a given time period
 3- ritern main non jiesti ditels nahin maangi jaae
 For example, petrol, conveyance etc
 expenses have nothing to do with GST, so their information should not be sought in the returns
 4- quantity viz or echesen code viz ditels maangi jaati he, jisaki vajah se ritern prakriya behad lambii bani hui he
 We suggest that sale and purchase details should be sought without the quantity and HSN code, especially for small and medium traders
 5- ritern main agar koi galati ho jaati he to use sudhaarney ke liye abhi koi vikalp nahin he
 This is highly unfair because mistake can happen to anyone
 hamaari maang he ki ritern riviz kaa system hona chahie
 6- Reverse charge section 9 (3) should be suspended at the moment
 is section main guds transport agencys yanitransportke madhyam se bheje gaye maal ke kiraaye kii ditels maangi jaati he
 The increasing desire of Indian consumers for gold, Finance Minister P
W
 chidambaram kii peshaani par bal pad rahe hai
 In the last quarter of 2012, the current account deficit of the country i
e
 the difference between the value of imports and exports increasing 5 of GDP (GDP)
 4 fisadi ke record str tak pahunch gaya
 About one-third of this gap is contributed by gold imports
 vahi sona jise kharidkar aksar aap apni tijori main rakh lete hai
 In comparison, even in the 1991 crisis, the current account deficit of the country was only 3% of GDP and at that time the gold of the country had come to the fore
 haalanki, tab ke vipareet ab ghate kii bharpai videshi nivesh se kii ja sakati he
 But UPA government's period of misrule has created uncertainty in it
 vitt mantri ke paas ghate ko kaabo main laane ke liye teen vikalp hai: niryaat main teji laaen, jo philhal vaishvik aarthik mandi ko dekhte hue mushkil he; kachche tel kaa aayaat ghataaen, agar bharat ko apni urja jaruraton ko puraa karnaa he to yah asambhav he; yaa sone ke aayaat par ankush lagaaya jaae jo tel ke baad duusari sabase zyada aayaat hone vaali vastu he or yah sabase aasaan vikalp he
 Soon after the government's current account deficit data was released on January 2, Chidambaram said, "there is no option left to us to make gold imports a little more expensive
" ’’ chidambaram se pehle vitt mantri rahe pranab mukherjee ne kareeb ek saal pehle 2012 ke bajet main sone par aayaat shulk ko 2 se badhaakar 4 fisadi kiya tha
 Unfortunately, just as Mukherjee's efforts to curb gold imports have largely failed, it seems that Chidambaram's efforts may also meet the same fate
 agar unhen isamen safal hona he to bharat kii fal-phool rahi gold iconmi ke paksh main bane majboot janamat ko parrast karnaa hoga-jisaki sambhaavna dur tak najar nahin aati
 Hardil Aziz gold It is a common misconception that Indians buy more gold in the form of jewelery
 hakeekat yah he ki pichley paanch saal main sona bharat main nivesh kaa pasandida jariya ban gaya he
 In five years (january 2008 to January 2013), there has been a tremendous return of 170% on gold
 isaki tulana main isi avadhi main share bazaar main paisa lagane waalon ko ausatan 4 fisadi kaa ghaataa hua
 Even in a gap of three years, gold has given better profits than equity
 janvari 2010 se janvari 2013 ke bich sone se jahaan 80 fisadi kaa ritern hasil hua he, vahiin is dauraan share bazaar se sirf 3 fisadi kaa hi ritern mil sakaa he
 If an asset has been successful in beating gold in terms of guaranteed returns in the medium term, it is another shiny metallic silver
 sone ko mahangaai ke jokhim se bachane kaa bhi acha saadhan mana jaataa he kyonki mahangaai keemtee dhaatuon ke mukaable kagaji asset kii vailu main zyada giravat laati he
 Due to its real value, gold has proved to be a safe asset in the period of slow growth in India and worldwide

 The important thing is that if an investor wants to invest in this yellow metal, it is not necessary to buy gold directly
 exange trade fund(itief) ke ubhaar ne sone ko rakhane ke jhanjhat ke bina usamen invest karne ko suvidhajanak banaaya he
 Take the example of 24-year-old Prateek Goyal of Sonadilli in paper, he opened his first demat account at the age of 19 and started investing a portion of his pocket money in the stock market
 ve bataate hai, ‘‘main nayaa tha, isliye main sabhi vikalpon par baariki se gaur karata tha or uske baad hi invest karata tha
 “about two and a half years ago, he got the whereabouts of better investment than the stock market
 vah thikaana tha sone main invest karne kaa
 He opted to invest in paper gold through etfs
 is udhyami ne bataaya, ‘‘jab maine itief khareednaa shuru kiya to keemat 12,000 se 13,000 ru
 It was per gram
 ab yah kareeb 30,000 ru

 He said, "I will stop buying only when the international economy improves
" tab tak to meraa sone main hi bharosa he
 "for those who still want to avoid complex instruments like etfs, the unique investment schemes of jewelery companies are proving to be an effective way to invest in gold
" kerala ke thodupujh main farmesi chalaane vaale 55 varshiya radhakrishnan ne pehle kabhi bhi sone ko investment vikalp banane ke bare main nahin sochaa tha, lekin do saal pehle jab keemten teji se baxi shuru huin to unhone iskaa iraadaa banaaya
 Her 21-year-old daughter Neenu Krishnan, who is also an engineering student, got inspired for her by getting married
 unhone kerala ke kuch jaanlari grups ke gold investment plan ke bare main vichaar karnaa shuru kiya
 Radhakrishnan said, "my wife Bindu had seen some advertisements in the media where several jewelers had plans to deposit money in installments to buy gold
" ek madhyamvargeey vyakti hone ke naate maine malabar gold or bhima jaanlari kii aisi hi installment yojanaon main paisa laga diya
 He invested money in the one-year installment plan of Malabar Gold and bought jewelry in exchange for the period
 philhal unhone bhima jaanlari kii ek skim main paise laga rakhe hai
 Radhakrishnan said, "if i get Rs 2,000 today
 kaa nivesh karata hum to ve sone kii keemat aaj ke hisaab se lagaate hai or utaneka sona mere naam se alot kar dete hai
 In this way at the end of the year i get jewels equal to the total weight of gold found in the installment

 Earlier such schemes were not available
