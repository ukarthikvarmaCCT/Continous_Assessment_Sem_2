 The multi-storey building of the hotel collapsed like a card in a few minutes
 bam dhamaake ko lekar zyada dimag naa lagaaie, visphot prashasan ne hi karaayaa
 In fact, the case is that a double bench of the High Court had ordered the Zamindoz a hotel built on illegal land in Ujjain, the city of Mahakal

 The court has refused to ban the reservation
 supreme court ne kaha he ki yah hoicourt kaa antarim aadesh he or court isamen dakhal nahin degaa
 It is worth mentioning that under the Rajasthan Backward Classes Amendment Act-2019, a petition has been filed by the state government against granting special reservation of five percent in MBC (extremely Backward Classes) to five castes including Gurjars, Luhar, Banjara, Rebari and Raika
 
 yachika main rajasthan hai court ke us faisle ko chunauti di gai he jisamen hoicourt ne rajya sarkaar ko notice jari to kiya tha lekin aarakshan par roak lagane se inkaar kar diya tha

 The petitioner contended that the Supreme Court had prohibited the granting of reservation beyond the ceiling of 50 per cent and in that case only one per cent reservation was payable and was being given

 Is Hollywood and Britain's TV Industries Apartheid? The controversy over not getting a black nomination for the second year in a row for the Oscar Award had not yet cooled down that a new controversy has arisen due to Michael Jackson's selection of a white artist
 buudhvaar ko british satellite tivi channel ski arts ne jaise hi ye elaan kiya channel ke kamedi sho main african-american pop starmical jackson kaa kirdaar british actor joseph phiness nibhaayenge, nayaa vivaad khadaa ho gaya
 Why are white actors playing for the role of black Michael Jackson? Why are people fighting for racial equality and apartheid in Hollywood not digesting why a white actor was chosen to play the character of Black Jackson? Why no black artist was denied this opportunity? Black artist was not selected in the Oscar nominations
 In fact, a similar controversy has arisen over the Oscar award just before the controversy over Jackson choosing the white artist for the role
 auskar puraskaron ke liye ek bhi ashwet kalakaar kaa namakan naa hone par abhinayta vil smith, nirdeshak spike lee or abhinetri jada pinketh smith jaisi hollywood ke ashwet sitaron ne auskar ke bahishkaar kaa elaan kar diya he
 In fact, this is the second year in a row that no black artist has been chosen for Oscar nominations

 Republic Day 2019:raashtragan or raashtragit ke bare main ham sabhi kaaphi bate jaanate honge
 But have you ever wondered what is the story behind the national anthem and the national anthem
 kaise "jan-gana-man" ko raashtragan or "vande maataram" ko raashtragit kaa darja diya gaya tha
 Today we will tell you about it in detail
 sabase pehle ham baat karte hai raashtragan kiagar kisi se puche to kaa aap raashtragan ke bare main kya jaanate hai to vah yaheen bataaenge ki 'jan gana man' tab se gaate aa rahe hai jab ham skool main hua karte the, yaa phir ise rabindranath tagore ne likhaa tha
 Do you know anything other than this
 
 
 bataa den, raashtragan saal 1905 main bengali main likhaa gaya tha
 It was first sung at the Kolkata (then Calcutta) meeting of the Indian National Congress on 27 December 1911
 us samay bengal ke baahar ke log ise nahin jaanate the
 The Constituent Assembly adopted Jana Gana Mana as the National Anthem of India on 24 January 1950
 Republic Day 2019: bharat ke tirange kii kahani, kaise bana hamaara rashtriya dhwaworth kii vajah se bana raashtraganrashtragan apane arth kii vajah se raashtragan banaaya gaya tha
 Some of its parts mean that the citizens of India, the people of India, with their hearts, consider you as the fate of India
 he adhinaayak (super hero) tumhiin bharat ke bhagya vidhaataa ho
 Along with this, different states of the country were also mentioned in it and their merits were told
 raashtragan ko puraa gane main 52 second kaa samay lagata he jabaki iske sanskaran ko chalaane kii avadhi lagbhag 20 second he
 There are 5 posts in the national anthem
 rabindranath tagore ne raashtragan ko na keval likhaa balki unhone ise gaaya bhi
 It was sung in Madanpillai, a small district in Andhra Pradesh
 raashtragit vande maataramis baat se kaaphi kam log hi waakif honge ki vande maataram ko pehle raashtragan banane kii baat kahi ja rahi thi
 But then it was decided to make it a national anthem
 kyonki uski shuruaati chaar line desh ko samarpit hai baad kii line bengali bhashaa main hai or maa durga kii stuti kii gai he
 Let's know that Vande Mataram is the national anthem of India, but do you know why it was made a national anthem rather than a national anthem
 ye he itihasavande maataram ko saal 1875 main bankim chandra chattopadhyaay ne bengali bhashaa main likhaa tha
 Which he also gave place in his novel Anandamath in the year 1881
 ise pehali baar ise raajnneetik sandarbh main rabindranath tagaur ne bhartiya rashtriya congress ke 1896 ke satr main gaaya tha
 On the other hand, if Bangla language is kept in mind, it should not be titled 'bande Mataram' but 'bande Mataram' as the word 'vande' is correct in Hindi and Sanskrit language, but the song was originally written in Bangla and Bangla There is no 'and' letter in the script, so Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay wrote it as 'bande Mataram'
 kya he vande maataram kaa matlabasanskrit main 'bande maataram' kaa koi shabdaarth nahin he or 'vande maataram' kehane se 'mata kii vandana karata hum' aisa arth nikalataa he, isliye devanagari lipi main ise vande maataram kaha gaya
 The creation of such a national song, when the song was composed by Bankim Chandra, the British rulers dominated India
 britain kaa ek geet tha 'god! seve da queen'
 This song was made mandatory in every function in India
 bankimchandra us samay sarkari naukari karte the
 Bankim was offended by the behavior of the British and he composed a song in the year 1876 and titled it 'vande Mataram'
 japan ke saath jari davis cap world group plaof muqablon main bhartiya team pehle hi din 0-2 se pichad gai
 India's Somdev Devvarman and Rohan Bopanna lost their respective singles matches
 yugal mukaable shanivaar ko or ulat ekal mukaable ravivaar ko khele jaaenge

 somdev bharat ke sarvocch or vishwa ke 65veen variyata praapt ekal tennis khilaadi hai jabaki sugita vishwa ke 175veen variyata praapt khilaadi hai
 Despite this, it was very disappointing for Somdev to easily lay down his arms
 duusari ore, ekal main 559veen variyata praapt bopanna davis cap main keval ekal mukaable main khelte hai jabaki nishikori vishwa ke 55veen variyata praapt khilaadi hai
 In this sense there was no competition between Bopanna and Nishikori but it was expected that if Somdev wins his first match and Bopanna also loses the second match, then India will be in a satisfactory position with a score of 1-1 on the first day
 Will remain ab bharat kii nigaah shanivaar ko hone vaale yugal mukaable par tiki he, jisamen mahesh bhupati or vishnu vardhan kii bhartiya jodi kaa saamana japan ke nishikori or go soeda ke saath hoga

 After this, two reverse singles matches will be played on Sunday on the third day of the matches, in which Bopanna and Somdev can be expected to perform better
 pehle ulat ekal mukaable main somdev kii bhidnt nishikori ke saath hogi jabaki duusare mukaable main bopanna or sugita bhidenge
 Somdev and Nishikori will be face to face for the first time
 isi tarah bopanna or sugita bhi pehali baar ek duusare se bhidenge
 Japan and India have clashed a total of 21 times so far, of which India have won 18 matches while three have gone to Japan

 agar chaaku main dhar nahin ho to khaanaa pakaane kaa kaam kaaphi mushkil ho jaataa he
 The knife is the most commonly used tool in the kitchen
 aise main agar wo hi kharaab ho jaae to uskaa prabhaav saare kaamon par padataa he
 In such a situation it is necessary that you have good quality knives
 kichan main istemaal hone vaale chaakuon kii dhar hameshaa acchhee honi chahie taaki aapako jo kuch kaatna ho wo aasaani se or tareeke se cat jaae
 It is difficult to use a knife without a blade, it is equally dangerous
 kai baar aisa hota he ki dhar sahi nahin hone par wo phisal saktaa he or haath main chot lag sakati hai
 Although there are some special tools to sharpen the knife, but if you do not want to go to the market and want to sharpen the knife at home, then these measures can prove to be effective for you
 acchhee baat ye he ki chaaku tej karne ke liye istemaal hone vaale ye saare upkaran bahut aasaani se aapako ghar main hi mil jaaenge
 1
 steel ke thos par ragadkajgar aapke paas steel kaa koi thos ho yaa phir lohe kaa to aap ghar baithkar hi chaaku kii dhar tej kar sakate hai
 Wash the steel concrete with water and clean it thoroughly
 iske baad us thos ko dhoop main rakh dijie
 When that solid steel is heated by sunlight, then rub the knife on it
 aapako shaayad kuch chingaariyaan uthati hui dikhaai den
 With this solution your knife will become a sharp knife but it is very important to be careful while rubbing the knife
 2
 There is no need to bother if you do not have any iron or steel concrete by rubbing on the rod
 aap ye kaam lohe yaa steel kii rod kii madad se bhi kar sakate hai
 Rub the edge of the knife on the steel rod
 kuch der aisa karne ke baad aap paaenge ki chaaku kii dhar tej ho gai he
 3
 grenite par ragadkargrenite stone par ragadkar bhi aap chaaku kii dhar ko tej kar sakate hai
 Rub the sharpened edge of the knife sharply on the stone
 chaaku kii dhar tej ho jaaegi
 However, it is very important to be careful while doing these experiments
 chaaku tej karne se pehle aapako ye jaan lenaa jaruri he ki har chaaku ko ragadkar dobaaraa dhardaar nahin banaaya ja saktaa he
 In such cases, sharpen those knives which can be sharpened again
 in teenon upayon main se kisi ko bhi apanaakar aap apane bekaar ho chuke chaaku ko dobaaraa se thik kar sakate hai
 But after that leave these knives in water and vinegar solution for a while
 isse chaaku lambey samay tak dhardaar bane rahenge

 saath ke dashak main mumbai main gujarati or dakshin bhashiyon kaa varchasv bad rahaa tha
 Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray saw the agony of the Marathi mind and understood it and by attracting the Marathi mind with his powerful speeches, he not only created a strong organization but also restored the lost identity of the Marathas

 bal thakare apane samay main chandrika kenya, prithish nandi or sanjay nirupam ko rajyasabha bhej chuke hai
 He also made North Indian leader Ghanshyam Dubey a member of the Legislative Council
 bal thakare ke bhattije raaj thakare ne jarur bhashaa vaad ko zyada tavajjo di or bhumiputron kaa haq dilaane ke naam par mumbai main uttar bharatiyon kaa virodh bhi kiya
 But Bal Thackeray's son Uddhav Thackeray has always been talking about taking everyone along
 jab aaj ke congressi netaa sanjay nirupam 'dopaher kaa saamana' ke kaaryakari sampadak or rajyasabha saansad hua karte the tab uttar bhartiya maha sammelan kaa aayojan bhi kiya tha
 However, Nirupam later left the Shiv Sena and joined the Congress due to some differences with Uddhav Thackeray
 udhdav thakare ke netritv main shivasena marathi asmita kii baat jarur karti rahi he lekin par praantiyon ke khilaaf koi vishesh muhim nahin chalaai
 Despite this, the Shiv Sena was retained as a strong political force in the state and keeping the party connected
 shivasena ke party adhyaksh aaj bhi uddhav thakare hi hai lekin zyaadaatar faisle unke bete aditya thakare lete hai
 When Uddhav Thackeray was asked when Aditya came to the election field, he said with utmost care that times are changing, Aditya is young, the thinking of today's youth is different
 aditya ko vidhayak kaamon main zyada ruchi he
 Good thing the whole family and party are with him
 matlab saaf he jo thakare parivaar remote ke bal par satta chalaane kii niti par chalata aa rahaa tha, use samaj aa gaya he ki badalte vakt ke saath raajnneeti bhi badal rahi he
 Strength is now more in the chair of power
 party main bad rahe kshatrapon ko agar niyantran main rakhana he to sarkaar main badi kursi par asin hona jaruri he
 Today's politics is difficult without the knowledge and control of the sources of party funds
 isliye aditya ko saal bhar pehle se hi bhavi mukhyamantri ke taur par prachaarit kiya ja rahaa tha
 It is not easy but impossible to reach the Chief Minister's chair by fighting only 124 seats in seat sharing with BJP
 chunaav parinaam kya hoga or raajnneeti kis karavat baithegi, ye kahana abhi mushkil he
 It is not limited to just Aditya contesting elections and placing hoardings in different languages
 hameshaa ugr hindutv or kisi bhi haalat main ayodhya main ram mandir banane kii vakaalat karne vaali shivasena ab musalamaanon ke adhikaar ke liye ladane kii baat bhi karne lagi he
 At the party's Dussehra conference at Shivaji Park, Uddhav Thackeray announced from the stage that his party is not only with Dhangar, OBC and other backward classes, but will also join the fight for the rights of patriotic Muslims
 unhone yaad dilaayaa ki chhatrapatri shivaji maharaj kii sena main bhi musalmaan sainik the

 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav kii raajnneetik bisaat dalit maton ke sahare bichaai jane lagi he
 The Narendra Modi government has taken a big step on the Dalit issue eight months before the Lok Sabha elections
 sarkaar SC / ST act par supreme court ke faisle ko palatakar uske puraane mul swaroop main behaal karne ke liye sanshodhan vidheyak laane kaa faisla kiya he
 This decision of Modi government is being considered as a step to break the anti-dalit image and remove their displeasure
 is kadam se dalit samudaay kaa dil modi ke liye kitna pasijega ye to vakt hi batayega?dalit raajnneeti kii takatdesh kii kul jansankhya main 20
 14 crore are Dalits
 desh main kul 543 loksabhaa seat hai
 Of these, 84 seats are reserved for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes

 The largest state with a Dalit population is Punjab

 The BJP is hopeful that Dalits' displeasure will not become costly for them in 2019, while opposition parties, including Congress, are trying to win the hearts of Dalits and return to power once again

 Apart from this, arrest of government employees can be done only after the permission of the competent authority

 There was violence in many areas in the Dalit movement across the country, in which a dozen people died
 supreme court ke faisle ke liye modi sarkaar ko jimmedaar maanate hue dalit samaaj centre sarkaar se apni naaraazgi jataa rahaa tha
 The central government and the BJP were said to be anti-dalit
 dalit sanghathanon ne sarkaar ko ek baar phir ultimatum de rakhaa he ki agar 9 agast tak essi asti act ko puraane swaroop main laane vaala kanoon nahin bana to wo bade paimaane par virodh pradarshan karenge
 The new government of Modi government decided to bring the SC / ST Act in its original form in view of the existing political equation
 sarkaar is sanshodhan vidhyak ko laati he to wo paas hokar rahegaa
 Given the importance of Dalit votes in the country, no party will be able to openly oppose it
 aise main phir ye kanoon apane mulswarup main aa jayega or supreme court ke pherbadal kaa koi matlab nahin rah jayega
 Along with this, there is a question whether after this decision, Modi-led BJP is now accused of being anti-dalit, will it be able to get away
 ambedkar mahasabhake adhyaksh dow
 Lalji Prasad Nirmal says that the government's decision on SC / ST Act is very important
 dalit samudaay ke liye SC / ST act lifline hai
 It is very important for every class of Dalits
 aise main modi sarkaar ne behatar or saahasik kadam uthaaya he
 This decision of the government will remove the resentment of the Dalit community and it will also benefit in the elections
 dalit chintak professor sunil kumaar suman kehete hai ki loksabhaa chunaav ko dekhte hue sarkaar ne kadam uthaaya he
 In such a situation, the conscious people of the Dalit community will not come under his guise
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar kya kadam uthaa rahi he ye mahatvapurn nahin he balki uski vicharadhara kya he ye myne rakhti he
 The bjp's ideology is anti-dalit tribal
 is baat se sabhi waakif hai
 Suman says that in the last four years the loss of Dalit tribals in the last four years has not happened as much as in fifty years
 modi sarkaar khushi-khushi SC / ST act main sanshodhan nahin karne ja rahi he balki dalit samudaay kaa unke upar pressure tha, isliye ye bill lekar aae
 They have decided to come under public pressure
 haalanki modi sarkaar ke kadam se endie kii sahyogi dalit partiyon ko raahat mili he
 Even after the change in the SC ST Act, questions were being raised about his intention to remain a partner in power
 ramvilas paswan, ramdaas athavle or udit raaj jaise dalit netritv ko apni hi sarkaar ke dalit muddon par bachaav karnaa mushkil pad rahaa tha
 Dalit thinker Prof
 ratan laal kehete hai ki sarkaar ke faisle se dalit samudaay nahin balki endie dalit sahyogiyon ko khushi jarur mili hogi, jo samaaj ke bich jane se batch rahe the
 Now, he will go among the Dalit community as an agent of the Modi government and put his side of the government, but the society has become aware of them
 ve kehete hai ki essi asti act hi nahin balki aarakshan ko khatm karne jaise kai daliton ke mudde hai, jinhen lekar log modi sarkaar se naaraaz hai
 In such a situation, the government has taken steps under the pressure of society

 In such a situation, he is not going to get misled

 We have always been told that cholesterol is a bad thing, although the reality is slightly different
 cholestrol sharir kii har koshika main paaya jane vaala vasa jaisaa padaarth he
 It is an essential part of the body
 koshika jhilli kii majbootee, hormone se judi utpattiyon, tantrikaon or mastishk ke vikaas ke liye isaki jarurat hoti he
 It also produces hormones, vitamin d and food digestive substances in the body
 hamen jitne cholestrol kii jarurat he, vah sharir main hi banataa he
 But, when formed in excess of the prescribed limit, the blood increases the cholesterol and gets deposited in the blood vessels
 isse dhamniyon kaa maarg sankara ho jaataa he jise ethroslerosis kehete hai
 This increases the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD), cerebral palsy, and external vascular disease
 cholestrol chote-chote package main rakt kii dhara ke saath tairte hai
 These are called lipoproteins
 ye package bheetar kii taraf vasa yaa fat (lipid) se or baahar kii taraf protein se bane hote hai
 Low-density cholesterol, called low density lipoprotein (LDL), accumulates in the blood vessels, while high-density or high-density lipoprotein (HDL) is known as "good cholesterol" because these cholesterol can be used in other parts of the body
 Takes it back to the lever and locks it out of the body
 har 20 main se teen logon ko cholestrol kii koi na koi gadabadi hoti he
 But they do not have any symptoms and can be detected only by regular examination
 isliye zyaadaatar logon ko pataa hi nahin chalata ki unka cholestrol str bad gaya he
 Overall, the higher the level of LDL cholesterol in the blood, the greater the risk of heart attack and the higher the HDL level, the lower the risk
 khun main cholestrol kaa str khan-paan, shaareerik sakriyata or vajan par nirbhar karata he
 Cholesterol, saturated fat, and trans fat should be eaten in limited quantities and foods with mono and polyunsaturated fat (PUFA), such as safflower, sunflower, and fish oil, should be taken in greater quantities
 sookhe mewa bhi blad cholestrol ko kaaphi had tak gata dete hai
 Saturated fat is found in some carnivores, dairy products, chocolate, baked goods, high-oil-fried and processed foods, and some oils such as coconut oil
 hamaare khan-paan main yahi ve chijen hai jo ldl ke str ko sabase zyada badhaati hai
 Trans fats are found in some fried, baked and processed foods
 ye aapke sharir main ldl cholestrol ke str ko badhaate hai or echdiel yani achche cholestrol ko kam kar dete hai
 Well, we have no control over certain things like heredity, age
 haai blad cholestrol kai baar khandaan kii viraasat main miltaa he, kyonki yah dekha gaya he ki metabolic gadbaditaan mukhya rup se anuvaanshik kaarnon se hoti hai
 Not only this, as the age increases, the level of LDL also increases
 55 saal kii umr se pehle ldl kaa str mahilaon main purushon kii tulana main kam hota he
 But after the age of 55, LDL levels in them may be higher than men
 karnaa kya he aapako-har teen maheene main lipid profile test karwaakar cholestrol level jaanchen
 Take the food that controls cholesterol
 -jin bhi chizon main saturated fat paae jate hai unhen kam-se-kam khaaen
 For example, some meat, dairy and baked products
 -ghulansheel fibre se bharpoor jayee kaa dalia, seb, naashpati sareekhee chijen zyada khaaen
 These prevent the digestive system from absorbing cholesterol
 -prati din kam-se-kam 30 minute niyamit kasarat se sharir ke vajan ko kaabo main rakhen
 The talk of Rahul Gandhi going on leave has created more political jokes than churning on the state of Congress
 aae din videshon main chuttee manaane kii khabaron ke kaaran ye kataaksh kiya ja rahaa he ki kya chhuttiyon kii bhi apni thakaan hoti he, jise mitaane ke liye or chuttee chahie hoti he! Well rahul ke chuttee par jane ke faisale ne congress ke saamne ke sawaalon ko zyaada gambhir kar diya he
 Rahul Gandhi does not have the ability, yet Sonia Gandhi is betting on him, because she is stuck in son's fascination
 
 
 rahul gandhi ko lekar sonia gandhi par lagane vaala ye sabase aam aarope he
 And this is not just a critic of Congress, but many Congress stalwarts are also said in secret, sitting in their respective coters
 lekin shaayad aapako ye jaankaree bhunchakk kar jaae ki rahul nahin, priyanka thim sonia kii pehali pasand
 But for some reasons this could not happen
 isliye sonia gandhi putr moh main fansi hai, ye kahana or maan lenaa congress kii andruni gheron ko ati sarlikrut taur par dekhnaa hoga
 The 129-year-old party's three ties of relationships are like layers of onion peel
 jitna marzi chhilte jaao, ant main chhilka hi haath lagegaa
 In this sequence, tears will come out of eyes, so different
 aaie thodaa silsilewar dhang se samajhane kii koshish karte hai
 First go in 2004
 endie 6 saal ke apane shashan ke baad shining india ke slogan ke saath chunaav main utar rahi thi
 The Congress did not even have any hope that there was any chance of forming the UPA government from anywhere in the elections
 par party chunaav main takkar main rahanaa chaahati thi
 The party was with Sonia, but Sonia wanted inside that the time had come to hand over the command to the new generation of the Gandhi family
 sunne main ye ajeeb lag saktaa he ki jab party kii jeet kaa bharosa na ho, to phir sonia apni santan ko kyon daanv par lagaana chaahegi
 But then Sonia had a different thinking
 unhen aage ke liye congress kaa netritv taiyaar karnaa tha
 The general election is the best chance for a new leadership to emerge
 sonia isi mauqe kaa istemaal karnaa chaahati thim
 She wanted to give a strong message by presenting her next generation against atal-advani
 ve ye bhi jataana chaahati thim ki chunaav se pehle hi haar maananaa unki fitrat main nahin
 She wanted to compete and compete
 gandhi parivaar ke qareebi rahe ek sutara ke mutabiq sonia gandhi ne priyanka gandhi ko bulaakar apane man kii baat bataai
 Consulted and asked Priyanka to come to the ground
 lekin priyanka ne bahut hi sochakar manaa kar diya
 Priyanka, about whom Rajiv Gandhi herself has said that she had begun to understand political depths from an early age, why would she put her face forward at a time when there was a danger of burning hands
 puri congress ke saath-saath priyanka ko bhi is baat kaa tanik bhi bharosa nahin tha ki kahin se bhi congress ke netritv main koi sarkaar ban sakati he
 This assessment of Priyanka has created such a triangle of politics between priyanka-sonia-rahul, whose stinging of every angle is still happening to the party
 priyanka ke manaa karne ke baad sonia ne or koi chaara na dekh rahul gandhi ke saamne chunaav ladane kaa prastaav rakhaa
 Rahul could not defer to his mother's wish
 ve aae or amethi se maidan main utaar die gaye
 Becoming UPA One in 2004 under the leadership of Congress was nothing short of a miracle
 rahul gandhi sansad main dastak de chuke the, lekin laalan ke paanv abhi paalan se nikle hi the
 It is evident that the expectation of such political maturity from them was meaningless, which should be made the basis of handing them the power of governance
 ye sonia ke aasapaas kii us mandali ko bhi manzur nahin hota, jo beshak 10, janpath ke saamne apana sab kuch nyochhavar karne ko taiyaar dikhte hon, lekin andar hi andar apni mahatvakanksha bhi lekar chalate hon
 Rahul had jumped into the election to fulfill his mother's wish anyway, so no ardor of prime minister was born in him
 sonia, rahul par ekadam se itani badi zimmedaari daalane kii jokhim bhi nahin lenaa chaahati thim
 Sonia herself was under pressure to become Prime Minister
 ve pradhanmantri banate-banate kyon rah gayi, ye ek sarvavidit tathy he
 Well manmohan singh pradhanmantri bane
 UPA One was also formed after UPA One
 par rahul satta se dur rahe
 There was a reference to handing over power to them from time to time
 par pradhanmantri to dur, mantri tak banane se bachate rahe
 Many try to present it as a sacrifice of 10, Janpath
 lekin yahaan bhi sthiti pyaaz ke chhilake vaali hi thi
 Don't know what will come out on peeling sonia se rahul par zimmedaari daali nahin gai yaa rahul ne zimmedaari uthaane ke liye koi bharsak koshish nahin kii
 The big question was as much about his acceptance among the leaders of the coalition parties, as much as he was considered among the old veterans of the Congress
 iske baad aata he 2014 kaa chunaav, jahaan rahul kaa cheharaa aage karne ke baad bhi congress 44 siton par simat kar rah jaati he
 Even before and after the assembly elections, the Congress has continued to dive
 pichley 10 saal main rahul kii jo team bani he, wo is tarah kii haar ke liye us team par unguli uthaati rahi he, jo sonia gandhi ke aasapaas bani he
 Of course, Sonia may not have made it, but Sonia cannot walk without the suggestion and support of that team
 team rahul or team sonia ke bich ke takaraav kii yahi sthiti gaharaati chali gai he
 Team Rahul wants every big decision in the hands of Rahul, considering Sonia's lack of health and activism, but the far-sighted old warlord has managed to an extent to keep Sonia alert
 team sonia, sonia ko ye samajhane main ek had tak kaamayaab rahi he ki rahul puri zimmedaari nahin uthaa sakate
 Therefore, Sonia, who stood behind Rahul at one time, has been showing her reservations from time to time
 ve ek taraf jahaan apane puraane gards ko rahul ke coup se bachaati huin chalati nazar aa rahi hai, vahiin duusari taraf wo rahul kii qabiliyat par khud shaq karti nahin dikhnaa chaahati hai
 It is not that Sonia did not give Rahul the freedom to decide freely
 loksabhaa chunaav ke chaahe 15 siton par primarij kaa prayog ho yaa haal ke dilli vidhansabha main antim samay main ajay maakan kaa cheharaa aage kar chunaav ladane kaa faisalaa, rahul kii pahal kahin bhi rang laati prathit nahin huin hai
 This is the reason why Rahul's insistence on conducting organizational elections in a 'democratic' manner is now seen as stubbornness and there is no enthusiasm within the party
 sonia ko is sachai kaa bakubi ehsaas he
 Of course, as a mother, she sees great potential in her son, but as a political mother, she has read her son well
 lekin sonia ke saath majaburi ye he ki ab wo gol post nahin badal sakati
 In place of Rahul, she cannot knock Priyanka's door again
 priyanka ghoshit taur par bacchon or parivaar ke prati apni zimmedaariyon kaa hawala dekar beshak raajnneeti se dur hi rahane kii baat karti hon, lekin andarkhaane kii jaankaree ye he ki ab ve iske liye khud ko maansik taur par taiyaar karne lagi hai
 There are two problems
 na to bhai kaa juuthan khaanaa chaahati hai, or na hi bhai kii puri thali hi chhinte dikhnaa chaahati hai
 Also, how to get an opportunity from the mother whose initial offer was turned down
 or priyanka kii fitarat aisi he ki wo kuch bhi aadha-adhuraa nahin chaahati hai
 When the stage is set, she wants to come out with a gazelle
 or jab tak aisa nahin ho jaataa, wo ek bahan ke taur par bhai kii har raajnneetik samasya ko sulajhane main lagaataar santulit bhoomika nibhaate dikh rahi hai
 Only when Rahul is angry with many old leaders of the party after the electoral defeat, the panchayat appears in front of Priyanka and she appears to be trying to bridge the pass as an arbitrator
 wo kisi bhi tarah se maa ko naaraaz kar yaa unki na sunati nazar aakar bhartiya janamanas main bani maa kii bharosemand or qartavyapaalak beti kii chhavi ko tod bhavishya ke liye apana nuksaan nahin karnaa chaahatin
 a problem is also faced by Sonia
 priyanka ke haath main kaman jate hi 10, janpath par taala padana tay he
 There will be a danger of Sonia falling alone
 party ke wo tamaam diggaj jo abhi sonia ke saamne sheesh navate hai, party kii kaman khiskate hi priyanka kii ji-hazoori main lag jaaenge
 Overall, there can be a similar tussle between parents and daughters, as is often seen between father and son in politics
 jabaki rahul ko puraa kaman dekar bhi sonia us par apana ek swaabhaavik dabil rakh sakati he
 She is confident that Rahul will always keep her in the role of a guide as a mother and not push her into a guiding role like Advani
 isliye ye putr-moh nahin he, rahul, sonia kii majaburi kaa naam he
 So there is a wait for the son to return from leave

 maharashtra main dahi-handi maamle par sunwaayee karte hue supreme court ne faisla sunaaya he ki dahi-handi kii oonchai 20 foot se zyada nahin badhegi
 The petitioner had said that he is ready to ban children, but the ban should be lifted at a height of 20 feet
 desh-videsh main dahi-handi prasiddh he or pyramid kii oonchai ko lekar ginis book record bhi mil chukaa he
 The court said during the hearing whether you also bring medals to the Olympics
 agar aap medal laaenge to hamen khushi hogi
 Significantly, on August 17, the Supreme Court ruled in the case of Dahi Handi in Maharashtra and upheld the decision of the Bombay High Court
 iske mutabik, isamen 18 saal se kam umr ke bachche bhaag nahin lenge or dahi handi kii oonchai 20 foot se zyada nahin rahegi, haalanki supreme court ne kaha tha ki vah maamle kii aktubar main sunwaayee jari rakhega
 Earlier in the hearing, the Supreme Court issued notice to petitioner Swati Patil against Dahi Handi
 supreme court ne kaha tha ki puraani yachika kaa nistaaran ho chukaa he
 The petition is being resumed
 supreme court maharashtra sarkaar kii dahi-handi ke maamle main daakhil arji par sunwaayee kar rahaa tha
 The comments rajya sarkaar ne supreme court se 2014 ke adeshon main spashtataa dene kii guhaar lagaai thi, jisamen 12 saal tak ke bacchon ko dahi-handi main hissaa lene kii ijaajat di gai thi or saath hi hoicourt ke 20 foot kii oonchai simit karne ke aadesh par roak laga di thi
 The government says whether this order was for one year or is still in force? maharashtra sarkaar kii ore se ASG tushaar mehta ne supreme court ko bataaya tha ki 11 agast 2014 ko bombai hoicourt ne apane aadesh main kaha tha ki 18 saal se kam ke yuvak dahi-handi main hissaa nahin le sakate or isaki oonchai bhi 20 foot se zyada nahin honi chahie
 The organizers appealed to the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court stayed the decision of the High Court allowing children up to 12 years of age to participate and also stayed the height order, but later the Supreme Court gave this Petition disposed
 ASG ke mutabik, ab hoicourt is maamle main adaalat kii avmaananaa kaa maamla maanate hue sunwaayee kar rahaa he
 In such a situation, the Supreme Court should clarify about its order that after all this exemption was only for the same year or will continue to apply
 gauratlab he ki 17 agast ko maharashtra main dahi handi ke maamle main supreme court ne faisla sunaaya tha or bombai hoicourt ke faisle ko barkaraar rakhaa tha
 Accordingly, children below 18 years of age will not participate and Dahi Handi's height will not exceed 20 feet, although the Supreme Court had said that it would continue hearing the case in October
 isse pehle sunwaayee main supreme court ne dahi handi ke khilaaf yachikakarta swati patil ko notice jari kiya tha
 The Supreme Court had said that the old petition has been disposed of
 yachika ko dobaaraa shuru kiya ja rahaa he
 The Supreme Court was hearing a petition filed by the Maharashtra government in the dahi-handi case
 tippaniyan The state government had requested the Supreme Court to give clarity in the 2014 orders, which allowed children up to 12 years of age to participate in dahi-handi, as well as the High Court's order to limit the height of 20 feet
 Was applied
 sarkaar kaa kahana he ki kya yah aadesh ek saal ke liye tha yaa abhi bhi lagu he? ASG Tushar Mehta, on behalf of the Maharashtra government, told the Supreme Court that on August 11, 2014, the Bombay High Court had said in its order that youth below 18 years could not participate in dahi-handi and its height was more than 20 feet
 Should not be aayojakon ne supreme court main apil kii thi or supreme court ne hoicourt ke faisle par roak lagaate hue 12 saal tak ke bacchon ko hissaa lene kii ijaajat de di thi or oonchai ke aadesh par bhi roak laga di thi, lekin baad main supreme court ne is yachika kaa nistaaran kar diya
 According to the ASG, now the High Court is hearing the case considering the matter as contempt of court
 aise main supreme court apane aadesh ke bare main spasht kare ki aakhir ye chhot sirf usee saal ke liye thi yaa aage bhi lagu rahegi
 Earlier in the hearing, the Supreme Court issued notice to petitioner Swati Patil against Dahi Handi
 supreme court ne kaha tha ki puraani yachika kaa nistaaran ho chukaa he

 Aajtak's special program Mumbai Manthan's special session 'will Modi agree with Bhagwat?' In AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi and BJP spokesperson Shahnawaz Hussain clashed over the statement of Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 ovaisi ne kaha tha ki loksabhaa chunaav jeetne ke baad piem modi ne kaha tha ki 1200 saal kii gulaami ke baad hindustan ko aazaadee mili
 After all, what did he want to say? Does Shahnawaz also believe that the Mughal era was a period of slavery in India? On this Shahnawaz Hussain said that i consider the era of both the Mughals and the British as slavery
 ovaisi ne mughalon ke daur ko gulaami kaa daur maanane se inkaar kiya
 He said that the sons of Hindu mothers cannot be called foreign invaders for the Mughal emperor
 wo saare bharat main paidaa hue, jinhone tajmahal banawaye, laal kila banwaaya
 Shahnawaz Hussain opposed this argument
 unhone kaha ki sansad bhawan bhi angrejon kaa banwaaya hua he to kya angrejon ko mulk saunp diya jaae
 Hussain said that i consider the era of both the Mughals and the British to be slavery
 shahanvaj hossain ne kaha ki mughalon ne tajmahal banwaaya lekin modi ji garib ke bete hai wo tajmahal nahin banavaate garibon ke ghar banavaate hai
 They do not cut the hands of the artisans but instead join their hands
 garibon ke ghar gas chulhaa bhijwate hai
 Owaisi said that if Modi ji is such a well wisher of the poor, then why are the prices of petrol and diesel increasing so much
 jo gas chulhaa ujjwala main baanta gaya uskaa silendar itnaa mahangaa kaise kar diya gaya
 Hussain cited the global reasons behind them and praised the Modi government's economy and said that he handled the situation well
 shahanvaj ne kaha ki jisane somnath par hamalaa kiya, kya wo hindustan se mohabbat karata tha, khwaja garib navaj aae unhone mohabbat failaai saare hindu-musalmaan unke yahaan sir jhukaate hai

 On Friday, when Agarwal reached the jewelers' neighbor and saw the shutter broken, he informed the shop owner and the police

 At present, the police have registered a case and the case is being investigated, but the entire incident tells how the thieves in the capital Delhi are fearless and are comfortable committing such a big theft

 The mining workers were trapped in the mining work on December 13 in this mine situated on the top of the hill, due to the entry of the nearby Liten River

 Let us tell you that during the excavation in the mine on the morning of 13 December, 15 laborers were trapped when the water of the nearby Liten River filled up in this coal mine
 jalairao ke kaaran na hi ye majdoor baahar nikal paa rahe or na hi bachaav dal inke paas pahunch paaya
 Rescue was using two pumps of 25 horsepower to extract the water filled in the mine, but the water level was so high that the pumm proved insufficient
 jiske baad 24 disambar ko bachaav kaary sthagit kar diya gaya
 But as soon as 100 horsepower pumps arrived on Saturday, rescue work increased
 andiaref ke asistent commandent esake singh kaa kahana he ki kuch anya agenciyaan bhi bachaav kaary main shaamil hui hai
 The soldiers of Odisha Fire Services arrived with 10 high power pumps

 Rescue work in this mine 370 feet deep in Jaintia Hills is also difficult because such mines carry out mining through a narrow tunnel
 chunki is tarah ke khanan ko engiti ne aprakritik or avaigyanik qaraar dete hue bain laga chuki he
 Hence illegal mining is done through the Rat Hole Mine here

 After the frequent complaints of railway passengers, the Ministry of Railways is now going to make a big change in the way ticket booking is done to crack down on touts
 darasal yatriyon kii shikaayat thi kitikatacountaron ke subah aath baje khulne ke baad turant hi vahaan pahunchane par bhi conform tikat nahin mil paata he
 The railways investigated the matter and the very shocking scandal was exposed
 aantarik jaanch se pataa chalaa he ki har din computer rigerveshan system ke khulne ke ek minute ke andar dallalon dwaara 4,000 conform tikat kharide jate the
 Brokers used to misuse a facility of passenger reservation software to book tickets and sell them to passengers at a high price
 railway ke rigerveshan sotware main ek suvidha he ki kisi vyakti ne yadi pehle tikat kharid rakhi he to antim kshanon main vah maatr kuch second ke andar apane yatra ke byore ko badal saktaa he or anya railgadiyon kii tikat book kar saktaa he
 Brokers used to buy tickets for less popular trains the day before and eight to eight the next day
 01 baje ke bich byora badalakar anya lokapriy railgadiyon jaise rajdhani, duranto or anya lambii duuri kii railgadee kaa tikat lete the
 It took them only a few seconds to do this, because their booking details were already present in the system
 railway board (trephic) ke sadsy ajay shukla ne bataaya, ‘dalal ek din pehle hi agrim tikat book kar lete the or agle din tikat ke byore ko badal dete the
 The booking clerk only had to provide another PNR, as the details would be fed into the system a day in advance
 tikat ke byore ko badalane main kuch second hi lagate the
 We have now disabled this feature for the first hour of the system opening
 ’railmantri ko shikaayat mili thi ki is tarah se har din badi sankhya main tikat book kiye jate hai
 After this investigation started
 jaanch main yah bhi sanket mili hai ki racket main booking clerk or andar ke anya log bhi shaamil the
 The Railway Ministry has now apprehended the culprits and plans to take action
 ab rail mantralay ne ek baar log-in kar ek saath kai tikat book karaane vaale agenton par bhi nakel kasne kii tarkeeb sochi he
 Now a single ticket can be booked by logging in once
 i-tikat swayan kaatane vaale yatri ko bhi doosraa tikat book karne ke liye log-out kar dobaaraa prayaas karnaa hoga
 This rule will apply to everyone, including soldiers, including IRCTC agents
 yah niyam subah aath baje se dopaher 12 baje ke dauraan i-tikaton kii booking par lagu hogi, lekin aage kii yatra yaa vaapasi ke tikaton par yah pratibandh lagu nahin hoga
 Railway Board officials have been monitoring the booking pattern across the country for a few days here
 ab pehle minute main pehle kii tarah 4000 yatraaon va railgadiyon main badlaav ke sthaan par kuch main hi yah badlaav kiya ja rahaa he

 The second term of the Modi government has started with a controversy over the new education policy
 shiksha niti ke draft main dakshin ke rajyon main teen bhashaa formula lagu karne main hindi bhashaa ko anivaary karne par bavaal ho gaya
 Now it has been changed by the government, now the draft education policy has been changed from the government

 On Monday morning, the Government of India changed the draft of its education policy
 pehle teen bhashaa formule main apni mul bhashaa, schuli bhashaa ke alaava teesri language ke taur par hindi ko anivaary karne kii baat kahi thi
 But in the new draft which came on Monday, the word Flexible has been used
 yani ab schuli bhashaa or matra bhashaa ke alaava jo teesri bhashaa kaa chunaav hoga, vah student apni marji ke anusaar kar paaenge
 That is, no third language can be imposed on anyone
 isamen chaatr apane skool, teacher kii sahaayta le saktaa he, yani skool kii ore se jis bhashaa main aasaani se madad kii ja sakati he chaatr usee bhashaa par aage bad saktaa he
 In fact, the Kasturirangan Committee, which came before the education policy, in its report appealed to the government that the states should be seen as Hindi-speaking, non-hindi speaking
 apil kii gai he ki gaiyr hindibhashi rajyon main kshetreey or angreji bhashaa ke alaava teesri bhashaa hindi laai jaae or use anivaary kar diya jaae
 This language dispute has become completely political

 ye bavaal sirf raajnneetik nahin he, is par ab soshal media par bhi campan chalane shuru ho gaye hai
 On Sunday, there was a trend against the imposition of Hindi language, so today # hindiisnotthenationallanguage is trending again

 He also said that it was the biggest blunder during that period by the Nehru government to unjustly arrest Sheikh Abdullah
 is baat ko nehru ne bhi sweekaar kiya tha ki kashmir main unki niti sahi nahin gai thi
 Apart from this, Saifuddin Soz wrote that even after that many big mistakes were made from the Government of India, including the removal of Farooq Abdullah government during 1984 and making Jagmohan the Governor

 Right from the beginning of the Namami Gange project, there has been a big difference in the amount of its budget and expenditure
 2014-15 main 2137 karod rupee kaa bajet manjuur kiya gaya or raashi aavantit kii gai 2053 karod rupee lekin kharch sirf 326 karod rupee hi hue
 In 2015-16, an amount of Rs 1650 crore was sanctioned and Rs 18 crore was saved from expenditure
 is saal 2500 karod rupee manjuur kiye gaye hai
 But the expenditure has not yet been calculated
 'takneekee kaarnon se kharch nahin ho sakaa bajet'jal sansaadhan mantralay ke sutara ke mutabik uttarakhand, uttar pradesh, bihar or pashchim bengal ne apane liye manjuur dhanrashi kaa puraa istemaal nahin kiya he
 In this regard, Union Minister Uma Bharti denied the lack of synergy between the state and the Krend government and said that the entire world is united on the Ganges
 ye to apane hi desh ke rajya hai, ganga par sabaki sahmati he
 But as soon as the pace of work on the new schemes is going to increase, the results will start coming
 visheshgyon kii raay alagahaalanki is maamle main visheshgyon kii raay alag he
 Environmentalist Harish Bahuguna says that unless surface drainage of the Ganges or any river is done properly and honestly, there is no point in surface cleanliness
 bahuguna ke mutabik asli safai to gangaajal kii gunvattta sudhaarna he, usamen girane vaale sivej ke naalon ko rokna he
 The government has been saying that sewage will not be pumped into the Ganges after treatment
 aise main sawaal uthta he ki ganga se ham badi maatra main pani to nikaalenge lekin trited pani waapas nahin karenge to nadi kaa pravaah kaise banegaa or kaise aage badhegaa
 However, all these questions are also flowing in the slow stream of the Ganges

 The dates of the UP election may not have been announced yet, but there is a lot of political outcry over the candidate for the post of CM from the Samajwadi Party
 upi main cabinet mantri shivpal yadav ke baad ab samaajawaadee party kii ore se elaan kiya gaya he ki aane vaale chunaav main akhilesh yadav hi party ke siem ummidavaar honge
 Earlier on Sunday, Shivpal Yadav said that he would propose the name of Akhilesh Yadav himself for the post of CM the next time the Samajwadi Party gets a clear majority in the elections
 in do bayanon se upi ke siyaasi halkon main atakalon kaa daur shuru ho gaya he
 Because, these statements have come after SP Mukhiyam Mulayam Singh Yadav's statement in which he said that the Chief Minister's face of the party is not fixed in the assembly elections
 yahi nahin, beete shanivaar ko hi khud shivpal ne kaha tha ki kuch logon ko viraasat main or bhagya se sabakuch miltaa he
 Shivpal's statement was the sequel to the political battle between uncle and nephew
 aise main shivpal ke taaja bayaan main akhilesh ke prati sadbhaav or agle din party ke rashtriya mahasachiv kiranmay nanda kaa yah bayaan kai sanket detaa he, jisamen unhone kaha ki agle chunaav main sapa jeetegi or akhilesh yadav hi siem banenge
 Let us know what can be the advantage and disadvantage of the current ruling Samajwadi Party of the state by projecting Akhilesh as CM candidate or not
 bataur mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ne soobe kii janata ke bich khud ko ek vikaas purush ke taur par pesh karne kii koshish kii he
 If the Samajwadi Party loses in the elections, then its blame can be laid on Akhilesh
 isse akhilesh kii image ko kaaphi nuksaan hoga
 If the Samajwadi Party does not project Akhilesh Yadav in elections, as Mulayam Singh recently indicated, then the party will not be able to properly publicize the development work done in Akhilesh Yadav's government and make SP bigger
 Damage may occur
 agar akhilesh yadav ko siem project nahin kiya jaataa he yaa ummidavaaron ke chunaav main unhen haq nahin miltaa he, to party ke bheetar jari sankat or gaharaa ho jayega
 The party may have suffered its loss in the election
 sienkhilesh yadavasoobe main yuvaaon ke bich khaase lokapriy hai
 He has also run various schemes for the youth
 aise main siem ko tavajjo nahin die jane se yuva voter samaajawaadee party se dur ja sakate hai
 In recent elections, such voters have proved very decisive in all elections
 aise main samaajawaadee party ko nuksaan ho saktaa he
 Apart from Vikas Purush, the image of Akhilesh Yadav has been created as a CM who works above caste and religion and does not tolerate the mafia in any way
 yadav parivaar main chachaa-bhattije ke bich manmutav kii vajah bhi kaumi ekta dal kaa sapa main vilay or bhrashtachar ke aaropee mantriyon ko sarkaar main shaamil karnaa hi rahaa he
 In such a situation, if Akhilesh is not declared as the CM candidate, the other party will take advantage of this opportunity

 And then something happened that could be called a miracle
 pati-patni main samjhauta ho gaya or talaak cancil
 According to the news of News18, Gautam Das and Ahna of Birbhum were married in March 2016, but soon after their relationship broke out
 jiske baad ahana apane ghar waapas laut ai
 In the beginning of 2018, the matter got worse between the two, and Ahna filed a case of harassment against her mother-in-law
 haal hi main donon ne court main talaak ke liye arji daayar kii thi
 But when the hearing took place on 16 January, Judge Partha Sarthi advised the two to reconcile
 unhone kaha ki donon apane parivaar se dur teen-chaar dinon ke liye achche se hotel main saath rahe or phir baat karen
 But the husband turned down the offer, saying he had no money
 baad main jaj parth saarthi ne hi kaha ki hotel kaa sara kharch vah dene ko taiyaar hai
 But amid the debate, government lawyer Ranjit Ganguly said that he would bear the expenses
 iske baad jaj kii ore se pati-patni ko suraksha muhaiyaa ke aadesh die gaye
 a hotel was booked in Birbhum itself, and the matter was resolved
 nateeja rahaa ki talaak cancil hua
 Let me tell you that there have been many cases of divorce recently
 jinamein fasebuk, whatsap or anya soshal media plateform ke jariye talaak diya ja rahaa tha

 We took stock of the ground reality of Kiran vs Kejriwal, and started with those auto who are considered supporters of AAP, ie Aam Aadmi Party
 yakeen maniye, kareeb 20-25 auto waalon kii bheed main do hi log mili, jinka iraadaa kiran bedi ke naam par dol gaya, yaa yun kahen, jinaki aasthaa arvind kejariwal se dagamagaa gai
 Arvind Kejriwal was seen ruling the rest of the tongue even today
 kuch ne to naaraa tak laga daalaa, "chalegi jhaadu, udegi dhul
 
 
 There will be no claw, no flowers will blossom
 
 
 " It is not that anyone raised the sincerity of Kiran Bedi, but they refused to accept her as their leader
 kaha, netaa to vah eemaandaar hai, lekin party thik nahin
 We have kept our intention, we will give one chance to anyone who speaks for us
 phir laga, kyon na un jhuggivaalon ke dil bhi tatol liye jaaen, jinhen aam aadmi party kaa vot bank mana jane laga he
 We arrived in a slum on Minto Road, just behind the Kalibari temple
 chaay vaale se baat kii to kaha ki hamaari sud to ek hi letaa he, jo is baat kii guarantee bhi detaa he ki aapse koi rishwat nahin legaa
 When there was a 49-day government, no policeman used to take anything for free, now it is an old situation again
 kiran bedi ke naam par jhuggi ke ve log zyada jhukate nahin dikhe, jo aap ke voter hai
 Yes, he expressed his intention towards the BJP, which had voted for the BJP in the last election too, that is, staunch supporters
 jhuggi-jhonpadi main bhi kiran kii roshni bikharati nahin dikh rahi
 Talking to 10-12 people, three appeared in favor of BJP, but not in the name of Bedi, in the name of Modi and BJP
 ab aglaa padaav rehadi-patariwale the
 Arrived at the roadside market near RK Puram one day a week
 kareeb 30 dukandaaron se baat karne par sanket yahi mili ki agar koi bhaajapai he, to hi vot bijepi ko degaa
 Otherwise, Kiran Bedi's name has not confused anyone's intentions at the moment
 
 
 so, yahaan bhi kiran rehadi waalon kii jubaan se nadaarad dikhin
 It is as if Kejriwal has already won everyone's heart
 har koi vot dene ke peeche makasad bhi ginanaa nahin bhuulataa
 Bribery stopped, no policeman used to bother our villagers, what else is needed
 hamaari roji-roti kii jisane parvaah kii he, jisane ghoose ko band kara diya, hamaara netaa to vahi he
 At the moment it is too early to say who will win and who will lose, because Kiran Bedi is also a piercing of the house
 dilli ke matadaataaon main inaki bhi chhavi saaf-suthri bataai he or saath main bijepi kaa bhi sahaara jisane pichley chunaav main sarvaadhik seat arjeet kii thi or loksabhaa main bhi party ne dilli kii saaton siton par kabja kiya tha
 So it is probably too early to conclude on the opinion of a few people that who will win and who will lose? sachin tendulkar ke 100 antarrashtriya shatakon kaa ricardkabhi nahin tut paane vaala lagata he, lekin is star ballebaaj kaa maananaa he ki viraat kohli yaa rohit sharma main se koi unke is ricard ko tod saktaa he
 Tendulkar (39 years) said this when Bollywood star Salman Khan asked him this during a party in Mumbai
 yah party mumbai indians ke maalik mukesh ambani netendulkar ke 100 shatak ke sammanmen yojit kii thi
 Salman's speech had a sense of humor and sparked laughter when he began to question Tendulkar on whether anyone would break his impenetrable record
 bollywood ke is star ne kaha, ‘kya lagata he aapako? sidhe-sidhe bolo nahin tod paaegaa
 Even Tendulkar could not stop laughing at this
 unhone kaha, ‘mujhe lagata he ki jo tod sakate hai ve isi haul main baithe hai
 Salman's reply was, 'there is no chance
 ’tendulkarne kaha, ‘maine in yuva khilaadiyon ko dekha he
 These include Virat and Rohit
 yadi koi bhartiya ise todta he mujhe dukh nahin hoga
 Salman said in reference to Tendulkar's achievement, "I hope this record will be broken soon as the records are meant to be broken
 sachin yaar, aap har samay prashansa sunakar kaisaa mahasoos karte ho
 You don't think that 'okay
 main yah sab jaanata hum
 this is enough
 ’ is par sabhi hans pade
 This actor did not stop here
 salmaan ne aage kaha, ‘200 ke bare main kya vichaar he
 How will it be 100 to ban chuke hai ek or 100 banane main kitna samay lagegaa
 After this, the googly he threw threw a fountain of laughter again
 aisa suna gaya he ki sachin kaa ricard todna asambhav he or yah don nahin, yah main bol rahaa hum
 i can say this because my father wrote the script for that film
 amit ji (amitabh bachchan) ne usamen abhinay kiya tha
 Priyanka Chopra, who addressed this party's charman Sachin Tendulkar as 'sachin Sir', laughed mostly when he talked about this star batsman
 sachin is bich mukesh or nita ambani ke bich main baithe hue the
 Apart from the film world, past and present cricketers, politicians also praised the master blaster
 salmaan ne apane bhaashan kaa ant mazaakia andaaj main hi kiya
 He said, 'you are lucky that i did not spend my time in the studio, otherwise i would have been in your place at this time and these centuries would have been in my name
 ’baad main jab tendulkar ko maharasht ke mukhyamantri prithviraj chavaan se pratik chinh lene ke liye aamantrit kiya gaya
 On this occasion, he too did not hesitate to tease Priyanka Chopra for calling him 'sir'

 Actor Kunal Kapoor is very keen to play the role of superhero 'doga' in his upcoming TV series
 kunal kaa yah kirdaar 'doga' gussell, nakaaratmak or nayak ke vipareet chhavi vaala hoga
 Unlike other superheroes, Doga was created in 1992 by Raj Comic, who has no amazing powers and relies only on the qualities of combat skills
 khaskar marshall orts, boxing or apni asaadhaaran shaareerik takat par
 When the character is opposite to the protagonist, Kunal says, "doga is a very ambitious project, which i am a part of
 main lambey samay se is tarah kaa kirdaan nibhaane kaa sapana dekhtaa rahaa hum
 i am happy that it is coming true now
 doga ek superhiro he or is tarah kaa kirdaar pehle kabhi nahin dekha gaya
 This character is negative, grumpy and has an opposite image to the protagonist
 " He said, "this is going to be very challenging
 aakhirkaar doga ek nakaaratmak kirdaar he or ise ek krur vyakti kii tarah gadha gaya he
 Apart from this, there will be different types of martial orts and will have to be taught
 yah bahut badi jimmedaari he lekin main iske liye taiyaar hum
 " doga ke kirdaar par vistaar se baat karte hue raaj comic ke manish gupta ne kaha, "hamaare liye doga ek bahut hi mahatvakankshi pariyojna he or ise parde par utaarne ke liye ham rachanaatmak or behad pratibhashali dimag ke logon ko le rahe hai

 " Talking in detail on Doga's character, Manish Gupta of Raj Comic said, "for us, Doga is a very ambitious project and we are taking creative and very talented minds to put it on screen

 When Bhatt was asked if Asaram was questioned in front of the victim during the detention period, he said that they were both questioned but not in front of each other as both had refused to do so

 uttar pradesh vidhansabha chunaav ke baad purna bahumat ke saath satta main ai samaajawaadee party (sapa) ke shasankaal main abamayawati sarkaarake samay main shuru kii gai kuch yojanaon ko band kiye jane tathaa kuch yojanaon kii dhanrashi ko roke jane kaa khatra mandaraane laga he
 Mayawati had introduced some schemes during her tenure in the Rural Development Department, including Mahamaya Awas Yojana and Mahamaya Sarvajan Awas Yojana, Kanshiram Awas Yojana, Kanshiram Urban Composite Development Plan
 iske saath hi mayawati kii ore se ambedkar gram vikaas yojana bhi shuru kii gayi thi, jiske tahat ambedkar gram ghoshit kiye gaye gaanvon ko kaaphi chamakaane kii koshish kii gayi thi
 However, in the name of flashing the villages, the contractors looted loot
 sapa kii sarkaar banane ke baad ab aise sanket mil rahe hai ki in yojanaon ko band kiya ja saktaa he yaa phir in yojanaon ko jari hone vaali dhanrashi roki ja sakati he
 Mayawati started the Mahamaya Awas Yojana on the lines of Indira Awas Yojana in the year 2007-08, under which only poor families belonging to scheduled castes and tribes can get housing
 isi tarah purvavarti mayawati sarkaar ne varsh 2008-09 main mahamaya sarvajan awaas yojana kii shuruyaat kii thi jiske tahat gaounusuchit jati or anusuchit jati ke logon ko hi iskaa laabh miltaa he
 Under the scheme, 45 thousand rupees are given to the beneficiary
 graamy vikaas adhikariyon kii maane to lakh take kaa sawaal yah he ki ab sapa sarkaar purvavarti basapa sarkaar kii mukhiya ke naam par chalaayi ja rahi yojanaon kaa prachaar karnaa kyon chaahegi isliye ab sarkaar kii taraf se aise sanket mil rahe hai ki in yojanaon aane vaale dinon main band kiya ja saktaa he
 An official of the Rural Development Department said that there is already a system of Indira Awas Yojana to provide housing to poor families
 ab nai sarkaar kisi bhi keemat par yah nahin chaahegi ki mahamaya ke naam par yojanaayen chalaakar purvavarti sarkaar kaa gungan kiya jaae
 The official said that there is a churn in the government that the schemes running in the name of Mahamaya should be stopped or they should be run in the name of others
 raajnneetik vishleshak or varisht patrkaar abhayanand shukla kehete hai ki is baat kii sambhaavnaaen hai ki mayawati ke kaarykaal main shuru hui yojanaon ko thande baste main daalaa ja saktaa he yaa phir yojanaon ke naam par jari hone vaali dhanrashi roki ja sakati he
 Shukla says that this can be done in the same way as Mayawati came to power, bypassing the Lohia Park in Lucknow and focused all attention on Ambedkar Park and idols
 usee prakaar sapa kii sarkaar bhi ab apane mahapurushon ko lekar yojanaayen banaae to isamen koi aashcharya nahin hona chahie
 Meanwhile, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) strategists believe that it will not be easy for the new government to shut down the schemes running in the name of Scheduled Castes and Tribes and Ambedkar as most of the 50 Dalit mlas have won the assembly from SP

 Raghuraman Rajan has blamed the UPA government for the huge non-performing asset (NPA) of the banks, even the Modi government has not given any clean chit
 unhone modi sarkaar kii kai yojanaon ko bhi enpie badhaane vaala bataaya he
 The Assessing Committee of the Lok Sabha had asked the former governor to appear before the committee and present his stand on the npas of banks
 kamity ne rajan ko apana paksh patr ke jariye rakhane kii chhot bhi di thi jiske baad raghuram rajan ne enpie par silsilewar dhang se loksabhaa kii samiti ko apana jawaab diya
 Raghuram Rajan said, 'the government should also pay attention to the sources that may be responsible for the next crisis
 khaskar sarkaar ko mahatvakankshi karj lakshya yaa karjamaafee se bachanaa chahie
 He described schemes like Mudra Loans, Kisan Credit, MSME Credit Guarantee as new sources to increase npas
 gauratlab he ki piem modi or endie sarkarmudra lonjaisi yojana ko rojgaar srijan ke bade prerak ke rup main dekhati he
 Rajan warned, "mudra loans and Kisan credit cards are popular, but they will have to be tested thoroughly in view of the possibility of increasing debt risk

 ' 2015 cricket world kapakesemifinal main parajayke baad hamane bahut sari pratikriyaayein dekhin
 All kinds of statements and views were seen in which the praise was less and more angry
 jis desh mencricket dharm kii tarahaho vahaan zaahir he, yah to hona hi tha
 Apart from this, due to India's successive wins, there was a feeling in the minds of cricket lovers that our team can win this cup
 yah sahi he ki hamane saat match hi nahin jite balki har match main pratidwandvi team ko out kiya
 This brought home the belief that we can beat anyone who was not true
 ham bhul gaye the ki isi australia ne hamen lagaataar haraaya tha, test main bhi or van de main bhi
 Keeping the edge of successive defeats, we also forgot the way Dhoni re-energized the team
 ham yah bhi bhul gaye ki world cap shuru hone ke pehle to ham spardhaa main kahin the bhi nahin
 Like 1983, India was expected to return soon
 lekin dhoni kii tarif kerani hogi ki unhone ek parrast or kamazor si dikhne vaali team ko phir se khadaa kar diya
 Without any pressure, he boosted the morale of his players
 unhone apane kamazor paksh gendbaaji ko sudhara or tej gendbaajon ko kuch kar dikhaane ke liye protsaahit kiya
 India was never known for fast bowling, but Dhoni, by trusting his bowlers, got them to do what was almost impossible
 hamaare tej gendbaaj charchaa kaa vishay bane or sabhi kii tarif kii gai
 In any World Cup, India's fast bowlers took the most wickets and it is from this that Mohammad Shami alone took 17 wickets in this tournament
 umesh yadav or mohit sharma ne bhi kamaal kar diya
 Umesh took the maximum 18 wickets, of which 4 were from Australia
 mohit sharma ko chaturaai se istamaal karke dhoni ne unhen ek behtareen gendbaaj bana diya
 The credit for the success of these three goes to Dhoni who put his trust in him and made the exact strategy for him
 unhone har khilaadi par bharosa jataayaa or unke bare main shaayad hi kabhi kadave vachan bole hon
 It is an example of Dhoni's excellent captaincy and teamwork that India became a contender on seeing this World Cup
 dhoni ne team ko un oonchaaiyon par pahunchaaya jahaan ke bare main kalpana bhi nahin kii jaati thi
 This time also his effort was commendable
 australia ke khilaaf agar kuch mahatvapurn khilaadi nahin chale to isame captain kya kar saktaa he
 Dhoni tried his best to get the team out of a bad score and scored the most runs
 ek captain se aap or kya ummid kar sakate hai?dhoni ne is toornament ke sabase behtareen captain ke rup main apane ko sthapit kiya or yah bahut badi uplabdhi he
 We should be proud of Dhoni
 khel ko khel kii bhaavana se khelnaa chahie or ise unmaad se dur rakhana chahie

 Whether or not Chief Minister Narendra Modi will win the Gujarat election, whether Modi will be a contender for the post of PM after the 2014 general election, whether or not Rahul Gandhi will be a contender for the post of Congress, but the discussion of Modi vs
 Rahul Gandhi for quite some time It was only today that it seems to be changing in reality
 patan jile ke siddhpur main ek chunavi raily ko sambodhit karte hue narendra modi ne kaha, 'rahul gandhi ji mere pita pradhanmantri nahin the, vah sarpanch bhi nahin the, lekin log mujhe tab bhi pyaar karte hai
 ' vahiin, siddhpur se 30 kilometre dur bansakanth jile ke palanpur main rahul gandhi ne bhi chunavi raily ko sambodhit kiya
 Narendra Modi today took a lot of sarcasm at Rahul Gandhi in the rally
 modi ne kaha, rahul baba agar aap chunavi sabha karne aae ho to apana homework puraa karke aao
 i know what you say as soon as i get off the helicopter
 iske aage modi ne kaha, rahul baba jab aap helicopter se yahaan se jaaen to is bheed ko jarur dekhen
 He also advised Rahul Gandhi to read the geography and history of this country
 isi ke saath unhone kaha ki rahul gandhi ne aaj bhi vahi kaha jo vah kuch din pehle bhi kah chuke hai
 The Congress party is unable to understand why the people of Gujarat have chosen Narendra Modi
 rahul gandhi ke gujarat ke aviksit hone par sawaal uthaate hue logon se poocha ki kya aap logon ko 24 ghante bijli nahin milti, 24 ghante pani nahin miltaa
 Do you need a generator
 logon ne jawaab main diya, nahin
 Similarly, Rahul Gandhi asked in the rally and people answered yes
 narendra modi jahaan is baar vikaas ke naam par logon se vot maang rahe hai vahiin, sonia gandhi, pradhanmantri manmohan singh or rahul gandhi gujarat kii sarkaar par vikaas ke maamle main bhedbhaav karne kaa aarope laga rahe hai or kah rahe hai garib logon kii modi ne andekhi kii he
 The comments is par bhi aaj modi ne kataaksh karte hue kaha ki shrimati gandhi ne sirf 'garib pratyaashiyon' ke liye hi prachaar kiya he
 He expressed surprise that Mrs Sonia Gandhi is promoting only a few rich candidates
 siddhpur main bhaajapa ke jainarayan vyas or congress ke balavant singh rathod ke bich muqabla he
 While Vyas is a minister in the government, Balwant Singh is the richest candidate in the state in this election
 apane shapathpatr main balavant singh ne 268 karod kii sampatti kii ghoshnaa kii he
 When Modi attacked Congress leaders, the people openly supported Modi
 vahiin sarkreek ke mudde par logon main zyada ruchi nahin dikhaai di
 Addressing an election rally at Siddhpur in Patan district, Narendra Modi said, 'rahul Gandhi ji my father was not the Prime Minister, he was not even a sarpanch, but people still love me
 ' At the same time, Rahul Gandhi also addressed an election rally at Palanpur in Banaskanth district, 30 km from Siddhpur
 narendra modi ne aaj raily main rahul gandhi par tamaam kataaksh kiye
 Modi said, Rahul Baba, if you have come for the election meeting then come and finish your homework
 aap kya kehete hai mujhe helicopter se utarate hi pataa chal jaataa he
 Next to this, Modi said, Rahul Baba, when you go from here by helicopter, definitely see this crowd
 unhone rahul gandhi ko is desh kaa bhugol or itihaas padhane kii bhi salaah de daali
 With this, he said that even today, Rahul Gandhi said what he had said a few days ago
 congress party ko yah baat hajam nahin ho rahi he ki aakhir gujarat kii janata ne narendra modi ko kyon chunaa he
 Raising questions on Rahul Gandhi's underdevelopment in Gujarat, he asked people if you do not get 24 hours of electricity, 24 hours of water
 kya aapako jenerator kii jarurat padati he
 People responded, no
 thik isi prakaar rahul gandhi ne raily main poocha tha or logon ne uskaa jawaab haa main diya tha
 While Narendra Modi is seeking votes from people in the name of development this time, Sonia Gandhi, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Rahul Gandhi are accusing the government of Gujarat of discriminating in the matter of development and saying that Modi of poor people Is ignored

 gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi ko rashtriya raajnneeti main to entry mil gai he lekin unhen lekar virodh sirf endie main hi nahin balki bijepi main bhi unki aguwai main kaam karne ko lekar matbhed shuru ho gaya he
 Modi's program was postponed during Vasundhara Raje's election rath yatra due to the protest
 bijepi ke dilli darbar main to modi kii entry ho gai, lekin bijepi ke garh kahe jane vaale rajyon main modi ke liye no entry kaa board lag gaya
 In the 2014 election strategy, the Sangh and the BJP considered it necessary to rule in front of Modi's domination, but other satraps of the BJP started rejecting Modi's patronage
 modi ko lekar bijepi main grih yuddh kii shuruyaat rajasthan se hui, jahaan chunavi rath lekar guuruuvaar se rajya ke sabhi 200 siton par suraaj sankalp yatra par nikal raheen vasundhara raaje apni raily main modi ko bulaane par raji nahin huin
 During the Rath Yatra of Vasundhara, the first rally will be attended by BJP President Rajnath Singh, then the journey will end in the presence of Sushma Swaraj
 yahi nahin duusare charan kii rathyatra main laalkrishna adwani or arun jetali hi shaamil honge
 The bjp's Rajasthan unit made it clear that even if the party was considering Modi as the trump card to get the Delhi seat, it would have to obey the Queen's order to regain the rule of Rajasthan
 ab sawaal ye he ki aakhirkaar modi kii rajasthan main entry ko lekar maharani ko parhez kyon he? vasundhara modi se duuri bana kar kyon rakhana chaahatin hai? vasundhara modi ko raily main na bula kar ek tir se chaar nishaanaa saadhane kii kavayad main he
 First, Vasundhara does not want Modi to loot her political show, second, Modi did not invite Vasundhara during the Gujarat elections, then Vasundhara did not tell Modi
 teesraa vasundhara gahalot sarkaar ke khilaaf alpsankhyakon kii naaraazgi ko bhunaanaa chaahatin hai
 So she does not want the minority vote to be polarized because of Modi
 chauthaa modi se duuri bana kar vasundhara khud kii secular chhavi ko majboot karne main peeche nahin rahanaa chaahatin
 Although Vasundhara was questioned about Modi, she thought it better to avoid it
 darasal rajasthan ke gopalgarh cond main police kii goli se 10 alpsankhyakon kii maut ho gai, jisase gahalot sarkaar ko lekar alpsankhyakon main kaaphi naaraazgi he
 Vasundhara wants to capitalize on this anger, so that she can take the votes of the minorities in the 30 assembly seats called decisive in the areas of Udaipur
 jaahir he modi ke liye muslim samudaay ke rukh ko lekar sawaal philhal khatm hota nahin dikhataa
 a section of the BJP may be demanding that Modi be made the PM candidate, but before sitting on the throne of Delhi, Modi will have to win the battle in his home as well

 Born on 24 December 1924 in Amritsar, Punjab, Rafi Saheb came to Mumbai and sang for a Hindi film for the first time in 1944 and the name of that film was 'village Ki Gori'
 aaj unke janmdin ke maukey par jaaniye unase judi kuch khaas baaten- - Do you know that Mohammed Rafi sang about 26 thousand songs
 saal 1946 main film 'anmol ghadi' main 'tera khilonaa tutaa' se pahchaan mili jiske baad unhone peeche mud kar nahin dekha
 - At the time when Rafi used to sing, he was probably the only singer who sang songs for another play-back singer
 film 'raagini' main 'man mora baavaraa' or film 'sharaarat' main 'ajab he dastaan teri yah zindagi
 
 
 The song was sung by Rafi for Kishore
 - kehete hai ki rishi kapur chaahate the kii film 'laila majanu' main kishor kumaar unke liye geet gaayen, lekin madan mohan ne mohammad rafee ko chunaa
 Rafi was so appreciated that after this Rafi became the voice of Rishi Kapoor
 - jab mohammad rafee nidhan hua, to mumbai main khub barish hui
 People said that mother Saraswati was crying on her death
 us din mumbai main joro kii barish ke baad bhi rafee sahab kii antim yatra main kam se kam 1 xxrep 4 0 log sadakon par the
 - Do you know that Rafi wept several times while singing the song 'babul ki Duaan Leet Jaa'
 iske peeche vajah thi ki is gane kii recording se ek din pehle unki beti kii sagaai hui thi
 Due to which Rafi Sahab was very emotional
 itani bhavukta main gaae gaye is geet ke liye unhen 'neshnal aword' mila
 - Rafi Sahab received 6 Filmfare and 1 National Award
 bharat sarkaar ne unhen 'padam shri' sammaan se sammanit kiya tha
 Rafi sang songs in many Indian languages, such as Konkani, Assamese, Punjabi, Marathi, Oriya, Bengali and Bhojpuri
 iske alaava rafee sahab ne parsi, dach, spanish or english main bhi geet gaae
 The comments - bahut hi kam log is baat se waakif hai ki mohammad rafee kaa nik nem ‘fico’tha
 As a child, he used to listen to fakirs on the way and from there Rafi Sahab started singing
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki mohammad rafee kaaphi dayaalu bhi the
 It is said that he never used to discuss fees for the song
 kabhi-kabhi to 1 rupee main bhi geet gaye diya karte the

 Railway Protection Force (RPF) jawan allegedly opened fire on a family in Ramgarh district of Jharkhand
 isamen teen logon kii maut ho gai jabaki do ghayal hai
 The police gave this information on Sunday
 ramgarh ke police adheekshak (espi) prabhaat kumaar ne bataaya ki arpeef jawan pawan kumaar singh ne shanivaar ko apni nau mem pistaul se railway main kaam karne vaale kuli ashok ram or unke parijanon ko kathith rup se unke ghar main goli maar di

 Kumar said that Ram's family lived in the quarters built in the railway barrack under the Barkakana police station, while the jawan was stationed at the Barkakana junction of the East Central Railway
 donon ghayalon ko ranchi sthit aspataal main refer kiya gaya he
 Pankaj Kamboj, Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG), North Chotanagpur Division, visited the scene along with other senior police officers
 police ne bataaya ki arpeef jawan bihar ke bhojpur jile main karath gaanv kaa rahane vaala he, jo ghatana ke baad se faraar he
 He told that Bittu Ram (30), another son of Ashok Ram, told the journalist who arrived there that his family runs milk business and the jawan is one of his customers
 jawan par 1200 rupee kaa bakaayaa ho gaya tha isliye shanivaar ko use doodh nahin diya gaya, jiske kaaran gusse main aakar usne parivaar ko goli maar di
 RPF Inspector Sunil Kumar Gupta said that the jawan was posted as a security assistant to the Assistant Commandant of RPF in Barkakana

 unhone manch se kaha ki rahul gandhi kii hamen jarurat he
 They lead us

 When Raja Berar was speaking from the stage, Rahul also looked towards him and during this time slogans were raised for Rahul Gandhi in the hall

 Raja Brar said that former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi is an idea, he will remain in our hearts

 He said that Rajiv Gandhi has done many notable works for this country
 rajeev gandhi desh ko number van bananaa chaahate the
 If the country is polio free today, its credit goes to Rajiv Gandhi
 rajeev gandhi ne kaha ki desh main 18 saal kii umr main vot dene kaa adhikaar rajeev gandhi ne dilaayaa
 He got Navodaya schools established
 raja baraar ne kaha ki rajeev gandhi kaa dil ek khubasurat insaan kaa tha

 If the events before the elections in Chhattisgarh have to be narrated in one word, it is a word: Greatness
 vichaar kijieh afvaahen ye thim ki congress bahujan samaaj party (basapa) ke saath gathbandhan karne or purv mukhyamantri ajit jogi kii janata congress chhattisgarh (jessisi) kaa congress main vilay karwaane kii jugat main lagi he lekin tabhi 20 sitambar ko elaan ho gaya ki basapa or jessisi ne haath mila liye hai
 After a fortnight, speculations were being made that Jogi was the Chief Minister from Rajnandgaon
 raman singh ke khilaaf mukaable main utrenge lekin tabhi jessisi ke mukhiya ne elaan kar diya ki ve chunaav ladenge hi nahin or tamaam kayaason par viraam laga diya
 Then on 21 October Jogi said that he would contest from Marwahi from where his son Amit is currently an MLA
 is badalte falak par koi sthir or adig he to ve hai singh
 No matter how small the margin of victory is (2 in 2003 of vote share between BJP and Congress)
 6 fisadi ankon se lekar 2013 main 0
 8 percent), bjp's longest-reigning chief minister in the country has been at the peak of power in the state for the last 15 years
 haalanki lagaataar chauthaa kaarykaal hasil karnaa aasaan nahin bhi ho saktaa he, par unhone ek baar phir yah bidaa uthaaya he
 Singh has been ruling the state of Chhattisgarh very vigorously and his strategies have worked in the last elections
 magar jessisi-basapa ko eks-factor yani uskaa anjaan khilaadi ke taur par ubharna maan len, to aise main kya doctor 2018 main jeet kaa sahi-sahi nuskhaa likh paaenge?seat kii khaasiyaton ke hisaab se dakhlachhattisgarh 90 siton kaa chota-sa rajya he
 In such a situation, the management of every small thing including the candidate in every constituency assumes great importance
 singh kii team uttar or dakshin chhattisgarh kii adivasee or saamaanya shrenee kii siton ko alag dhang se le rahi he, jabaki madhya chhattisgarh kii anusuchit jatiyon (essi) ke liye arakshit 10 siton or essi ke dabadabe vaali anya 10 siton ko alag dhang se le rahi he
 The emphasis in North and South Chhattisgarh is to work at the constituency level to change the opinion of the people in favor of the BJP
 kuch ahm siton ke liye ummidavaaron kaa chayan bahut choti-choti baton par dhyaan dekar hi kiya ja saktaa he, isiilie yah kaam maheenon se or kuch maamalon main to saalon se chal rahaa he
 One such example o
 pi
 Chaudhary is the one who resigned from the IAS job to contest on the BJP ticket from Kharsia, the Congress stronghold
 dabadabe vaali jati se aae choudhary ko dantewada or raipur ke colector rahane ke dauraan shiksha ke kshetra main kiye gaye unke nae-nae kaamon se janaa jaataa he
 The Chief Minister saw in him the ability and the possibility to break the strong clutches of Congress in Kharsia
 dakshin bastar ke dantewada main, 2013 main jiram ghati main maovadiyon ke hamale main maare gaye congress ke divangat netaa mahendra karma ke bete chhavindra karma ne samaajawaadee party ke tikat par apni maa or congress kii maujuuda vidhayak devati karma ke khilaaf chunaav ladgaye ke elaan kar diya tha— haalanki baad main ve peeche hat gaye
 Analysts are watching Shrayapur's hand in this development — if the Karma family votes are split between mother and son, the BJP will ultimately benefit
 maujuuda 49 vidhayakon main se bhaajapa ne 16 (30 fisadi se zyada) ke tikat kaate hai
 In 2013, the party cut 18 out of its 50 mlas
 satta virdohi bhaavana se bachane ke liye ummidavaar badalane ko ahm mana jaataa he
 In contrast, the Congress cut the tickets of only three sitting mlas in its list of 72 candidates announced on October 30
 yah bhaajapa ke liye phydemand sabit ho saktaa he kyonki 2013 main congress ne 34 vidhayakon ko phir se maidan main utaara tha or unamem se 27 chunaav haar gaye the
 However, in spite of its own hard work, BJP has given tickets to the family members of many sitting mlas
 chandrapur ke vidhayak yudhvir singh judev kii patni sanyogita ne isi seat se tikat hasil kar liya, jabaki laloongaa main bhaajapa vidhayak suniti rathia ko badalakar unke pati satyanand rathia ko tikat de diya gaya
 The intention behind this is that the revolt within the party should be minimized
 chhattisgarh ke 12 mantriyon main se keval ek mantri taqatvar sahu samudaay se aane vaali ramshila sahu ko party kaa ummidavaar banane se inkaar kiya gaya he
 The BJP is looking towards the tribal belt in the north and south with a hopeful eye to compensate for the potential losses here, given the sluggish condition reserved for the scs in SC and Chhattisgarh in the north and south
 essi ke liye arakshit 10 main se nau siten philhal bhaajapa ke paas hai or in siton par party ne aise essi ummidavaar utaare hai jinhen gaiyr-essi votaron main sabase zyada lokapriy mana jaataa he
 She is assuming that any division of non-sc votes associated with the Congress will go to the benefit of the BSP-JCC, given the basis of Mayawati in SC and Most Other Backward Classes (MBC)
 bilaspur or durg sambhaagon ke essi ke dabadabe vaale ilaakon main trikoniya mukaable ke jabardast asaar hai
 There is a possibility of non-sc votes being split between BJP and Congress
 takreeban 45 siton par essi vot 10 fisadi se zyada he jiske chalate in siton par basapa-jessisi agar tagade ummidavaar utaarti hai to trikoniya mukaable kii sambhaavna bad jaaegi
 The urban seats of Raipur, Bilaspur and Durg in central Chhattisgarh, apart from one or two difficulties, appear to be in the grip of the BJP
 bhaajapa ke think tinkon kii raay he ki 2013 ke kuch rujhaanon ko ulatna jeet ke liye ahm hoga
 In 2013, the party won just 11 of the 29 seats reserved for tribals
 inamen dakshin chhattisgarh kii 12 main se chaar siten bhi thim
 This year, several welfare schemes were launched one by one targeting tribal communities
 inamen tendupatta todgaye waalon ko 275 karod ru
 There was also a plan to give bonus of Rs
 13 lakh and this amount was distributed among 13 lakh tribal families
 gaanvon main bijli pahunchane or sadaken banane par jabardast jor diya gaya
 Chief Minister Singh paid Rs 300 per quintal on the purchase of paddy for the sake of 16 lakh farmers
 kaa bonus dene kii yojana ko bhi dobaaraa lagu kar diya
 Setting up "connect" When it comes to election-winning schemes, the state government's Sanchar Kranti Yojana (SKY) launched on 26 July is a good example
 apane kism kii is alahada khayraat main koi 30 lakh smartphone mahilaon or chaatro ko baante gaye hai
 This initiative was expected to push Chhattisgarh to the top in all the states in terms of teledensity, ie telecommunications density and coverage — as it lagged behind on this front
 eskevai ke labhaarthiyon ko bahut soch-samajhakar chunaa gaya he
 The analysis of the previous elections in the state showed that whenever there is heavy voting, then the BJP benefits
 party ko yah bhi lagata he ki smartphone se uske soshal media abhiyaan ko badhaava milegaa
 Embracing the vision of the people, the BJP is not only beating up the past achievements of the Raman Singh government, but also promising the future
 party ne ek vijan dastavej—atal drushti patrakrujari kiya he, jisamen matadaataaon ko bataaya gaya he ki vah 2025 tak chhattisgarh ko khushhaal rajya banane ke liye kya-kya or kaise karegi
 Singh says, "while there have been major improvements in the social and economic indices, the Vision Document contains our promises of what we want to achieve in the future
" ''iske alaava kshetra par kendrit khaas ranneetiyaan bhi banaai gai hai
 Certain tribal constituencies in north Chhattisgarh, such as Jashpur, Pathalgaon and Kankri, have seen BJP campaigning for polarization among the tribals who have not converted to Christianity and not converted to religion
 party ne jashpur jile main patthalgadhi pratirodh andolan ko bhi carch pryojit baghawat ke taur par pesh kiya he
 From the point of view of common people, Chhattisgarh is dominated by corruption, unemployment and anarchy
 magar virdohi party hone ke naate congress inhen chunavi muddon main badalane main naakaam rahi he
 On the other hand, the Congress has managed to keep the BJP entangled in issues like fake sex CD scandal and prohibition
 magar bhaajapa ke sabase bade ashaavadi bhi chhattisgarh ko aise rajya ke taur par dekhte hai jahaan ek dashak yaa itane hi vakt pehle tak votaron ke dimag main sabase congress kaa naam aata tha
 This is the reason that the Congress has remained in the fight despite the challenge of the bjp's election machine made with oil and water
 bhaajapa ke liye bhi, jahaan jeet kaa antar 2003 ke vidhansabha chunaavon se lagaataar ghatata gaya ho, vahiin jab 2019 kaa loksabhaa chunaav sir par mandara rahaa ho, to chunautiyaan or daanv keval badhane hi hai
 The direct impact of the assembly elections is certain to be on the Lok Sabha elections as there will be only about six months left between the two
 isliye bhaajapa or congress donon apni aage kii sambhaavnaaen samrudh karne kaa prayaas karengi
 Chhattisgarh's electoral charkha-bharatiya Janata Party has 14 women in its first list of 78 candidates, the highest ever for the party
 2013 ke vidhansabha chunaav main party ne rajya main 10 mahila ummidavaaron ko utaara tha
 - The BJP has given 25 tickets to candidates under 40 years old - which is part of its strategy to attract youth
 -magar maidan main kai puraane chehre bhi bane hue hai
 Fourteen BJP leaders, who lost the 2013 assembly elections, have been given tickets again
 raman singh sarkaar ke 12 mantriyon main se 11 ko dobaaraa chunaav maidan main utaara gaya he, inamen se paanch mantriyon ne 2013 ke chunaav main haar kaa munh dekha tha
 - The largest OBC (other Backward Class) community in the state - Sahu - is engaged in wooing both BJP and Congress
 bhaajapa ne saamaanya shrenee kii 51 main se 10 siton par sahu ummidavar utaare hai
 - The family of former Chief Minister Ajit Jogi is making his presence felt
 jogi jahaan janata congress chhattisgarh ke tikat par chunaav lard rahe hai, vahiin bete amit kii patni richa bahujan samaaj party kii ummidavaar hai, jogi kii patni renu congress ke tikat kii talabgaar hai
 - The closest advisor to Chief Minister Raman Singh is a select few current / retired bureaucrats
 unki salaah ateet main kargar rah chuki hai or 2018 ke chunaav main bhi ve ahm bhoomika adaa kar rahe hai
 - On 26 July Raman government has launched Sanchar Kranti Yojana under which about 3 million smartphones are distributed among women and students
 is chunavi yojana kaa bhi asar dekhne ko milegaa
