 Legendary belief is that the 15th Kannada poet Kumaravayas decided to write the Mahabharata for this reason, because he could hear the sound of groaning from the burden of many poets who wrote the Ramayana of Sheshnag bearing the burden on the earth
 unke is 'samvedanheen' arth par koi naaraaz nahin hota ki kai ramaayane hai, bahut sari
 From what Kumaravyas said, we did not stop reading his magnificent poems

 ramanujan ko vahi baat kehane ke liye ek vishvavidhyalay ke paathyakram se hataa diya gaya
 Ramanujan was my teacher for 6 years at the University of Chicago in the 1980s
 ramanujan kaa jivan puri tarah vichaarsheel jivan tha
 He wrote poems, translated, taught students, pondered over stories
 ek or kahani se zyada vicharotejak unke liye kuch or nahin hota tha-vah kahani, jo unhone pehle na suni ho, vah kahani, jo us kahani kaa ek bhinn rup ho, jo ve pehle se jaanate rahe hon, vah kahani, jo haashie par padi kisi samskruti yaa bhashaa kii ho
 Where the rest of us were blind and deaf, one could see the emotional connection with our infinite eagerness, cosmopolitan mind and unique intellect, who could write an essay titled Three Handred Ramayans Five Examples and Three Thoughts on Translation, be it only Ramanujan
 Could ramanujan bhashaa vigyaan main prashikshit the or unhone sahitya or bhashaa kaa sookshm or najuk gathjod padhaayaa tha
 i did not know anyone else as they were alive about the nuances of language and literature
 unhone chaatro kii ek peedi ko sikhaaya tha ki boli main bhed yaa kisi kahani ke bhinn sanskaran kaa kabhi asammaan mat karo, kyonki vyavasthit or kanoonon se bandhi is pranali main is tarah ke vyavdhaan hi hamen us cheez ko behatar dhang se samajhne main madad kar sakate hai, jo (ekadhipaty vaala) 'moulik' ban gai he
 i think my teacher and public intellectual Ramanujan must have been surprised to see that his essay about the literary traditions of the Ramayana is being taught in the history department
 main sochati hum ki ve yah jaanakar achambhit ho gaye honge ki media ke kuch tabake ne khud unhen bhi ek itihaaskaar main badal daalaa he
 It would crush him that his beloved Ramayana-pluralism and the vibrant diversity that enlightened the cultures of the subcontinent and beyond, confined it to the shackles of left and south, religious and secular, history and literature

 ramanujan kii mrityu ho gai
 Then i wrote a tribute to my teacher, Raman
 us samay maine yah sochakar khud ko santvanaa di thi ki unka kaam jinda rahegaa, yah ki padtaal kii unki bhaavana or har tarah kii kahaniyon ke prati unka aakarshan hamen us bare main zyada gaharaai se vichaar karne ke liye prerit karata rahegaa, jo ham padhate hai, chaahe vah dharmik ho yaa dharmanirpeksh, shastreey ho yaa lok paaramparik
 Today i find that i am writing a tribute to his soul
 main sochati hum ki ve is baat se dhwast ho gaye honge ki kavi kii kalpana ke kartab, udaaravaadi or anudaaravaadi vidwaanon ke bich aakraamak or rakshaatmak tarkon main badal die jaaenge

 ’input: bhashaa a heart-wrenching case has come to light in Nalanda district of Bihar
 jahaan bekaabu bheed kanoon haath main lekar khud insaaf dene utar ai
 The mob accused the assassination so that the color would stand up
 shahar main kaarobaari kii hatya kar bhaagate ek aaropee ko bheed ne dabocha or uski jamkar pitayee kii
 After this he was first thrown down from the roof and then tried to burn the bloodied accused alive
 ye sann kar dene vaali vaardaat nalanda ke mahalpur mohalle kii he
 According to people, on Friday morning, four miscreants shot a businessman together
 maukey par hi kaarobaari keemautaho gai
 Then people chased the accused
 teen aaropee to faraar ho gaye magar chauthaa aaropee bheed ke hathe chadh gaya
 Then what was the crowd bent on doing justice in this matter itself
 ghatana kii khabar milte hi police maukey par ja pahunchi
 But in front of the anger of the crowd, the police also appeared helpless
 jab bhi mauka mila, naaraaz logon ne hatya aaropee par laat-ghuson, lathi-dandon se hamalaa kiya
 He was beaten that the accused was bathed in blood
 naaraaz logon ne use aag main dhakel kar jaan bhi leni chaahi
 Actually, he was first thrown from the roof to the ground
 phir jamkar maaraa-peeta gaya
 After this, he was pushed into the fire and finally he gave a big stone to that young man in the fire
 yahi nahin hatya se naaraaz logon ne kai gadiyon main jamkar todphod kii
 Many policemen were also injured during this period

 bheedtantr kii aisi hinsa jise lekar kai sawaal khadey ho rahe hai
 The crowd kept beating the accused
 police tamashbin bani rahi
 The crowd continued to sabotage
 pulisavaale dekhte rahe
 The crowd kept blowing the vehicle
 pulisavaale andekha karte rahe
 If the police came to action in time, there could be control over the ruckus
 hinsa par kaabo paaya ja saktaa tha
 But the lethargic attitude of the policemen added fuel to the fire
 hinsa ke baad jab pulisavaalon ko sud ai to 20 logon ko giraftaar kar liya gaya
 The question is why the policemen did not show promptness to stop the violence
 bijnesaman kii hatya ke baad police harakat main kyon nahin ai? sattadhari party kah rahi he ki sarkaar ko sushasan par lagate aise dhabbe kii phikr he
 There is a need to correct law and order by rising above the rhetoric, otherwise it will be difficult to stop incidents like Nalanda, Vaishali

 ' pashchim uttar pradesh main dalit yuvaaon ke netaa banakar ubhare bhim army ke sansthaapak chandrashekhar aaazaad se congress kii mahasachiv or purvi uttar pradesh kii prabharee priyanka gandhi wadra ne buudhvaar ko mulaakaat kii
 Even though the Congress is saying that this meeting should not be viewed through political spectacles, but the political implications of Priyanka's sudden meeting with Chandrashekhar are being extracted
 yahi vajah he ki meerut main hui is mulaakaat ke chand minute bhi nahin gujarey ki sapa adhyaksh akhilesh yadav basapa mukhiya mayawati se milane lakhanu sthit unke awaas par pahunch gaye the
 After bypassing the SP-BSP alliance, the Congress has been making every effort to strengthen its political ground in Uttar Pradesh
 aise main sapa-basapa se alag jo bhi vikalp najar aa rahe hai, unhen congress saadhane kii kavayad kar rahi he
 In this episode, the Congress is bringing the rebel leaders of the SP-BSP into the electoral fray by joining the party, which can increase the difficulties of the alliance in the battlefield
 uttar pradesh main dalit matadaata kareeb 22 fisadi hai
 The Dalit voter remained firmly entrenched with the Congress until the eighties, but with the rise of the BSP, the vote was eroded
 aise hi muslim matadaata bhi 1992 ke baad se congress se dur ho gaya or sapa or basapa jaise dalon ke saath jud gaya
 As a result, the Congress was reduced to number four
 priyanka gandhi wadra ke sakriy raajnneeti main kadam rakhane ke baad se congress inhen donon apane puraane votbank ko phir se jodne kii ranneeti par kaam kar rahi he
 Whereas the political base of the SP-BSP alliance rests on both these vote banks
 uttar pradesh or basapa kii raajnneetik ko kareeb se dekhne vaale saiyad kasim kehete hai ki chandrashekhar daliton ke bich ek factor rup main ubhare hai, lekin daliton ke netaa ke rup main aaj bhi mayawati hi sabase bada cheharaa hai
 Both mayawati-chandrasekhar come from the Jatav community of Dalit community and both are from West UP
 jatav samaaj daliton main raajnneetik rup se sabase zyada jaagruk he
 In such a situation, even though the Congress is trying Chandrashekhar, he will not have much effect in this time's election
 haalanki, kasim maanate hai ki chandrashekhar khulkar congress se paksh main saamne aate hai to saharanpur seat par hi kuch fisadi dalit yuvaaon ke vot hi tronsfar kara sakenge baaki siton par nahin
 At the same time, Dalit thinker Professor Dr
 ratan laal kehete hai ki sapa-basapa se alag jitne bhi vikalp hai, congress har jagah koshish kar rahi he
 The Congress first gave ticket to bjp's rebel MP Savitri Bai Phule by joining the party and has now met Chandrasekhar in this episode
 haalanki daliton ko bada vot sapa-basapa gathbandhan ke saath jayega, lekin samaaj kii najar raajnneetik dalon ke ghoshnaa patr or EVM par he
 Considering the activism of Chandrashekhar and the Congress and the growing list of Muslim candidates of the Congress, the BSP is not only worried but the SP has also become cautious
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki lambey samay se sapa ke kaddavar netaa mohammad ajam khan se na milane vaale akhilesh yadav ne kuch din pehle hi unase mulaakaat kii he
 Experts believe that Akhilesh wants to compensate for any possible loss with the vote of Muslim society
 unki is koshish kii ahmiyat chandrashekhar se priyanka kii mulaakaat ke baad or bhi bad jaati he
 The 3-day annual meeting of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh released in Pushkar, Rajasthan ends on Monday
 baithak se samaapan par sangh pramukh mohan bhagwat aaj yahaan apana sambodhan denge
 Also, the association's co-ordinator Dattatreya Hosbole will inform the officials on the issue of Kashmir and Ram temple in the meeting

 mohan bhagwat ke kaarykram se pehle pushkar main suraksha ke pukhta intjaam kiye gaye hai
 a large number of police forces have been deployed from Sangh workers
 jaankaree ke mutabik is salanaa baithak koi ahm prastaav paarit hone kii ummid kam he
 But everyone's eye is on the speech of Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat, what statement he will make on the issue of Kashmir and Ram temple

 People from 35 organizations associated with the Sangh have arrived to participate in this important annual meeting
 sutron ke mutabik baithak ko sambodhit karte hue bijepi netaa ram madhav ne assam main NRC lagu kiye jane kaa mudda uthaaya, saath hi desh main ghuspaithiyon kii maujuudagi par apni chintaa bhi jaahir kii
 According to information received from sources, Ram Madhav claimed that most of the people who got out of this list were Hindus while referring to the problems faced in the list of NRC
 saath hi unhone kaha ki sahi myanon main desh ke naagarik hi is list se baahar ho gaye hai
 Please tell that many BJP leaders have opposed this NRC list prepared by the Central Government on the directions of the Supreme Court
 netaaon kaa aarope he ki iske kriyanvayan main gadabadi he jisase sahi log bhi isse baahar ho gaye hai

 rajsamand ke khaufnak tareeke se ek muslim adhed kii hatya ne puure desh ko jhakzor diya he
 This is not a lonely incident against Muslims in Rajasthan, but rather a series of things have been done in Rajasthan in a systematic way that shows how it has become the new laboratory of hardline Hindutva
 1
 Murders in the Name of the Cow: The sequence of murders in the name of the cow is not taking the name of stopping
 abhi haal hi main 11 november ko alvar main hi umr khan naamak deyari kaarobaari kii hatya kar di gai
 Earlier in April, a Muslim man named Aspect Khan was killed in Alwar in the name of cow smuggling
 june main bhi tamilnadu ke sarkari karmchaariyon par bhi gaay ke naam hamalaa kar diya gaya tha
 2
 padamavati vivadakkarani sena kii ore se padamavati film ko lekar pradeshbhar main hangaamaa machaa rahaa
 In November, an attempt was made to communalize the dispute through the corpse of Chetan Saini hanging from the trap wall of the Nahargarh Fort
 yah hatya thi yaa aatmahatya isaki jaanch police kar rahi he par ‘ham sirf putale nahin jalaate’ or ‘kafir’ jaise naare isi ore ishaara karte hai

 aresas se jude sanghathan ke meley main musalmaan virdohi parache:20 november ko jaipur main aresas se jude chennai se sanghathan spiritual and sarvice foundation ke meley main bacchon ke bich pamplate baante gaye jinamein kathith lav jehad se bachaane ke tareeke bataae gaye the
 They asked Hindu families to "tell their daughters that Muslims are dirty, militant, exploitative of women, traitors, supporters of Pakistan and blunt
" ” vidambnaa ki kathith taur par bacchon ke meley main rajya ke shiksha mantri ke nirdesh par bheja gaya or parche bantwaaye gaye

 rajsamand main afrajul kii khaufnak hatyah7 disambar ko afrajul naamak shaks ke hatyare ne apane video main lav jehad or kashmir se lekar musalamaanon ke khilaaf nafrat vaali har baat kahi he
 Ironically, on November 20, at Jaipur fair, hate pamphlets were distributed against Muslims on the pretext of love jihad
 police ab tak ki jaanch main ise hetkrime hi maan rahi he
 a recent data from the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) also indicates how communal tension has increased in the state
 iske mutabik saal 2014 main deshbhar main 27 hatyaon kaa makasad sampradayik tha or rajasthan main is makasad se ek bhi hatya nahin thi
 But in the latest 2015 figures, three such murders have taken place in Rajasthan
 aise daur main jab rajasthan main agle saal vidhansabha chunaav hone hai, rajya main sampradayik maahaul bigaadane kii koshish behad chintajanak he
 This is further worrisome because the ruling government and its affiliates and organizations are trying the tips of staunch Hindutva and poisoning hatred against Muslims
 20 november ko spiritual and sarvice foundation ke meley main aise parche baantnaa isaki tasdik karata he
 Breguit is of course a very important event
 yah aisa asaadhaaran mauka he jab kai saare sanyog milakar antarrashtriya maamalon main ek bade badlaav kaa sanket de rahe hai or yah bhi bataa rahe hai ki hamen ab aage kii taiyaari kaise kerani he
 This is a turning point in the case of globalization that has continued for the last three decades
 mana ja rahaa tha ki vaishvikaran ekatarfa rasta he, par bregsit ne sab badal diya he
 If we look at the history of better chance of connecting with the world, there have been both political and technical reasons for the world to move towards globalization
 isaki raah prashast karne vaali pramukh rajnatik ghatnaayen thim—1983 main grenada hamalaa,1989 main berlin kii diwaar kaa dhahna or phir 1991 main soviet sangh kaa vighatan
 It was a sign of the emergence of democracy and many thinkers predicted the end of history
 isi dauraan china kaa udai hua or 2001 main vishwa vyapaar sanghathan main pravesh ke saath vah duniya ke pramukh niryaatkon main shaamil ho gaya
 At the same time, with the boom in software exports, India also became a global country
 vastuon ke aadan-pradaan se badha samparksbase adhik aabaadi vaale in do deshon kaa udai do takneekee karkon se hua jisane vastuon or sevaaon ke vaishvikaran kii prishthbhumi taiyaar kii
 First, the use of containers in global shipping
 container yaa shboxy kii khoj kareeb 60 saal pehle hui or jaldi hi isane antarrashtriya dhulaai kii laagat ko kaaphi kam kar diya
 The container revolution in global trade was more favorable than any other factor
 saste shram kii badaulat china ko is ghatnakram kaa jabardast phayda mila
 Now the bundles of clothes from China started reaching the Mall of Kansas at a very low cost, because now the long transportation of goods from ship to rail, then road became very easy
 is tarah container kranti ke kaaran hi vastuon ke vaishvikaran kaa aagaaj hua
 The second major factor reduced by the communications revolution was the Dotcom era, started in 2000, which laid the ground for large-scale investment in fiber optics, which also laid cables across the Atlantic
 isse bhartiya companiyon ke liye software niryaat kaa rasta khul gaya or sevaayen vaishvik hone lageen
 Just 12 years ago, i was sitting on the couch outside the cabin in my office at Infosys, explaining to Tom Freedman how technology has made it easier to overcome market bottlenecks
 meri baton ne unhen da world ij flats kitaab likhane ke liye prerit kiya jauntarrashtriyastar par best celler hui or us daur kaa sabase prabhaavshaalee vichaar ban gai
 Changes are coming in
 Things are beginning to change because the middle class is not getting the benefit of globalization for the last few years, especially in western countries
 unki aay ghat rahi he or naukariyaan chhot rahi hai
 They have begun to look at migrants and refugees from countries with different customs and rites
 bregsit se yah sanket bhi miltaa he ki vaishvikaran kii raftaar abhi or dhimi padegi or anya desh bhi avrajan or shram kii awajahi kaa prakiya ko mushkil bana sakate hai
 This is a defining time in the last 40 years of travel
 bregsit vot chunauti paidaa karata he to avasar bhi detaa he
 It has proved that countries will have to become stronger domestically and cannot depend on exports for the pace of development
 agar itihaas par najar daalen to saath ke dashak kaa japan ho, sattar ke dashak kaa korea, yaa phir assi kaa china or dakshin purv asia, sabhi ne vaishvik supplai chen or niryaat ke sahare garibi se nijaat pai
 In this way, they developed with the help of exports
 china ne to gajab kii misaal kaayam kii
 This story has now ended on the challenge of dealing with changes, that is, India or any developing country can not remove poverty through export
 vastuon, sevaaon yaa shram kaa niryaat bahut mushkil hota ja rahaa he
 Therefore, the strategy of export based development has lost its utility
 mote taur par har desh ko apane gharelu bazaar ko zyada sakasham banane ke saath saamaajik asamanthaayen bhi dur kerani hongi, tabhi ve saamaajik taur par vaishvik ekikaran ke paimaane par khare utrenge
 This broad trend has special significance for India
 hamaara vaicharik model purana pad gaya he
 Increasing exports are essential for faster growth, experts say, should emphasize "make in India" and encourage the production sector by encouraging big companies
 ye teenon beete dinon kii baaten hai
 i think India's future lies in our domestic market, not in exports
 iske sanket milane bhi lage hai
 Surprisingly, our exports have been falling for 17 consecutive months
 vaishvik kaarobaar main vaishvik vikaas ke mukaable kam badhotaree ho rahi he
 It simply means that domestic economic growth of the world is fueling global growth, not exports
 yani sara kaam gharelu morche par hi ho rahaa he
 So, this is what we should focus on
 utpaadan par bhi karnaa hoga foksek ahm dharna yah bhi he ki bharat kaa vikaas sevaaon ke jariye hoga
 Production will continue, but unlike Korea, China and Japan, it will not be a growth engine
 darasal, utpaadan ko dohari baadha kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he, jisamen ek he atyadhik automation kaa rujhaan
 Today robotics, 3-D production, artificial skills have significantly reduced the production sector's dependence on labor
 aaj kisi utpaadan sanyantr main ucch takanic ke jaankaar chand logon ko hi rojgaar miltaa he
 Another important factor is that during the last thirty years, China has built up large-scale production capacity
 masalan, china main aaj salanaa 80 karod ton ispaat kaa utpaadan ho rahaa he, jabaki bharat main kul utpaadan mahaj 10 karod ton he
 In such a situation, China will export the steel left after consumption and this will make it difficult for us to produce steel at competitive cost
 upaay sirf yahi hoga ki aap shulk sambandhi rukaawatein khadi karen, jaisaa hamane ispaat ke maamle main kiya he
 Therefore the production sector is facing double pressure due to excessive production on one hand and automation on the other
 isliye seva kshetra main hi kaam tej karne kii jarurat he
 Time to place bets on small companies We know that the era of big companies is over
 yah vakt choti-choti companiyon ko jodgaye vaale plateform kaa he
 Amazon and Krilpkart provide a platform to sell goods to millions of vendors
 isi tarah, ola yaa uber apane plateform se lakhon driveron ko jodatii hai, practo doctoron or rogiyon ko jod rahaa he
 This series will continue like this
 bhartiya arthvyavastha mote taur par asangathit he
 But as soon as a taxi driver joins Ola, he becomes part of the organized economy
 vah karj lene, car kharidne, kar dene ke kaabil ho jaataa he
 That is, if millions of Indians are connected to the organized economy, then the pace of development will automatically accelerate
 hamen isi par dhyaan dena hoga
 There will be a lot of business opportunities in the light of Bregit, there are other solid reasons to focus on strengthening our domestic economy
 hamaare paksh main kuch acchhee baaten bhi hai
 First, India is the only young country in the aging world
 duusari, bharat main prati vyakti aay kaaphi kam he or ise 2,000 dollar se badhaakar 10,000 dollar karne se hi aantarik vyapaar ke kaaphi avasar paidaa honge
 Third, urbanization, knowledge of English, streamlining of processes, reducing the cost of interaction with the use of technology, smart phones, Aadhaar and bank accounts have huge opportunities for growth in our economy
 agar hamane sujh-boojh se kaam liya to kai varshon ke satat vikaas kii jameen taiyaar ho jaaegi
 Literacy basic needs The first priority of the government is that all should become literate and they should be counted, as this is the basic need to be a part of the economy
 misaal ke liye, ola ke taxi driver ko aapke sandesh padhgaye or nakshaa dekhakar aapke paas pahunchane kii yogyata honi chahie
 Be it Korea, or China and Japan, all fast moving countries had achieved full literacy before their rise
 isliye bharat sarkaar ko vyapak taur par shiksha kii behatari par dhyaan dena chahie
 Different needs of the new world system, everything is becoming micro in the new world order
 yah vyavastha technology ke istemaal se apni kshamtaaon ko ekajute kar rahe karodon chote utpaadakon kii he, mujhe lagata he, gharelu sevaaon par aadhaarit aisi vyavastha hi nav-nirvana or aatm-vikaas kii buniyaad he jo kam bharose se majboot bharose, lenden main hone vaali kam laagat or vishaal sanghathanon kii jagah chote utpaadakon ko jodne ke plateform kii ore badhati ho

 Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal is on a dharna near Rail Bhavan
 ve 10 dinon tak dharne par baithe rahenge
 He has demanded from the Ministry of Home Affairs that three shos be suspended

 One of these shos is alleged to have refused to arrest a woman at the behest of their minister Somnath Bharti
 bharti aadhi raat ko ek muhalle main red karne gaye the
 He got caught in misconduct with some African citizens there

 loktantr main janata kii ek khaasiyat yah hoti he ki vah jitne sammaan se upar chadhaati he, utane hi veg se wo neeche gira detii he

 kah rahe hai ki vahiin se sarkaar chalaayenge
 He wants to do a new experiment of running the government on the road
 kejariwal yah bhi jaanate hai ki apane daftar main baithkar vah utani publicity nahin le sakate the
 This will be an opportunity that the media attention of the entire country will be on them

 gajetir main darj he ki janmasthan ke paas masjid thi vahaan nirmohi akhaada ne chabutara banaaya
 Around 1825, there was a ruckus on the permission to build Sinhdwar there
 phir adaalat ne yathasthiti banaae rakhane kaa aadesh diya yani andar masjid baahar puja
 04
 00 pm:dhawan ne vibhinn dastavej padhate hue kaha, aitihaasik carnegi ke sketch or varnan bhi babar ke banaai masjid kii baat kehete hai

 03
 57 pm:dhawan ne kaha, 1828 ke gajetir main hemalton ne masjid kaa koi zikr nahin kiya he
 While Marco Polo has mentioned
 ye daawa kiya gaya ki 360 mandir dhwast kiye gaye the
 The Gazetteer of the East India Company also said that there was a mosque there, which is said to have been built by Babur and Hindus consider it to be the birthplace of Rama
 03
 40 PM: Rajiv Dhawan said that if the petition was not filed in time, it does not mean that there was no mosque there

 dhawan ne kaha ki nirmohi akhaada ramghat par chalaa gaya tha, ek baar vivaadit imaarat kii marammat kii zarurat padi to prashasan ne musalamaanon se hi takhmina liya tha
 Rama Chabutra was then considered the birthplace of Rama

 The lawyer said that at that time it was believed that Ram was born on the plinth, this place is in the outer yard
 rajeev dhawan ne kaha ki ram chabutara ko hi vedi bhi kaha jaataa tha
 Numerous steps and several orders of the Nirmohi Akhara in history prove that the mosque was there and then Mahant Raghubar Das requested to worship Ramlala only on the Ram platform
 vakil ne kaha ki akhaade ke rukh or prashasan ke adeshon se nirmohi akhaade kaa ye daawa dhwast ho jaataa he ki vahaan masjid thi hi nahin

 In such a situation, this part does not come out on which you claim the mosque
 is par dhawan ne kaha ki puja ke adhikaar to sahajata ke aadhaar par diya gaya
 The Nirmohi Arena was only given the right to worship, in which case the land does not belong to him
 12
 00 PM: Advocate Rajiv Dhawan in the Supreme Court said that in 1885 Nirmohi Akhada demanded the right of worship, after which he was given a platform
 tab vahaan tital suut kaa koi masalaa nahin tha
 After this, Justice Chandrachud said that the authority of the deity is easily related
 1885 main suut file kiya gaya, lekin tital suut kaa daawa nahin tha
 The judge said that we have to proceed according to today's Muslim law
 aage justise bhushan ne kaha ki kya aap kah rahe hai ki masjid par quran kaa niyam hi lagu nahin hoga
 Justice Chandrachud said that your case is of mutual coexistence
 haalanki, rajeev dhawan bole ke meraa cese vakf kaa he

 It has not been even a week since the new season of Bigg Boss started that this show has come into the headlines with its contestants
 sho main aam logon kii category main shaamil swami omaji maharaj kii asal pahchaan ko lekar indinon khub khabaren chai hui hai
 Baba, who calls himself a virtuous Baba in the show, is slowly getting exposed in Bigg Boss, as well as Baba's family has made some shocking revelations about him
 ajtak ke saathom swamike bade bhai pramod jha se hui khaas baatcheet main is baba ke bare main aise kai khulaase hue hai jinhen sunakar aap chaunk jaaenge
 Find out what these are: 1
 tada arms act cese ke chalate omaji swami paanch saal jail main sajaa kaat chuke hai
 Swami Om's brother said that he was acquitted in this case, although this case of Arms Act imposed on him is false
 2
 Om Swamy's brother told that in the year 1972 he took the form of a monk
 unhone bataaya ki dilli ke motibagh main congress kii secretary raheen rani premalata ke yahaan hi baba sadhu bane
 3
 om swami ji kya kaam karte hai is par unke bhai bole, vah 420 vaala kaam karte hai, dhongi hai, unke saath naam judana hi hamaare liye beijjati kii baat he
 Pramod Jha said that he keeps trying his tantra mantra, but he does not know the truth about it, but he has learned the knowledge of astrology
 4
 Regarding Omji Swamy, who calls himself virtuous in Big Boss, Pramod Jha said that he lies a lot, cheating everyone and making others fight among themselves
 5
 Not only this, Pramod Jha said that he is also having a case with Baba, the house in New Khan Market, which he is referring to as his own, is his brother's house
 pramod jha ne kaha, 'sabase pehle om swami ne beauty parlor kaa kaam shuru kiya jisame unhone chhina jhapati kii or phir bari ho gaye, phir mere ghar ko hadapna chaahate the, vah mere makaan kaa taala todakar makaan ke kagajaat le gaye or mere saath marpet kii

 agar aapse 600 rupee main 5 logon ke parivaar kaa ek maheene tak daal-roti kaa intjaam karne ko kaha jaae to shaayad aap saamne vaale par baras jaaen or use khari-khoti sunaane lagen, lekin dilli kii mukhyamantri shila dikshit ke anusaar 600 rupee kaaphi hai
 Sheila Dixit believes that for 600 rupees, a family of 5 people goes for a month with lentils
 aap bhale hi ye naa maane lekin dilli kii mukhyamantri ke hisaab se aisa sambhav he
 According to the Chief Minister, the stomach of a person living in Delhi can be filled for just 4 rupees
 ab aap kahenge kii dilli kya desh or duniya ke kisi kone main bhi 4 rupee main pet nahin bharaa ja saktaa hai
 But Sheila Dixit believes this and perhaps she has a magic wand or some research due to which she is making such a claim
 annashri yojana ke tahat dilli ke garib pariwaron ko 600 rupee nakad sabsidi di jaaegi
 Sheila is saying that this amount is enough for 5 members in a family
 ab gaur karen to ek parivaar main 5 logon ke liye ek maheene main dilli sarkaar 600 rupee degi
 That means a budget for 5 people for a day's meal was 20 rupees
 iskaa sidhaa sa matlab ye hua ki ek aadmi ke khaane par ek din main 4 rupee kharch honge
 According to Sheila Dixit, stomach can be filled comfortably for 4 rupees
 ye to yojana ayog ke rojna 32 rupee kharch karne vaale ko garibi rekha se baahar rakhane vaale maanak se bhi gaya gujara ankada he
 If this is not called Sheela Dixit's joke with the poor of Delhi, then what to say
 dilli main annashri yojana ke liye cash subsidy transfar skim kii shuruyaat ke mauk par unhone ye baat kahi thi
 Congress President Sonia Gandhi launched the scheme
 yojana ke tahat garib parivaar kii mahila mukhiya ke bank khate main har maheene 6 sau rupee transfar ho jaaenge
 Sheila Dikshit's statement on the launch of the UPA-2 government's much awaited scheme 'cash Subsidy' Annashree Scheme in Delhi has once again given the opposition parties a chance to attack them
 mukhyamantri ne saaf kaha ki yah sabsidi paanch sadasyon ke parivaar main maheene bhar ke rashan ke liye kaaphi he
 In this, he can buy lentils, bread and rice
 shila dikshit ne shanivaar ko tyagaraj stadium main ‘cash sabsidi yojana’ kii lonching par jis samay bhaashan de rahi thim, upie or congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi bhi maujuud thim
 a woman who came out of the stadium rejected Sheila's statement that in a family of 5 to 7 people, the monthly ration cost is between 1000 and 3000 rupees and need not be told
 gauratlab he ki sabsidi kaa paisa sidhe logon ke bank khaaton main jamaa karne kii sarkaar kii yojana 1 janvari se shuru ho rahi he
 The government has given the slogan of your money to the cash subsidy scheme as game changer

 The CRPF has also released video evidence of this
 chhattisgarh ke bijapur or sukama kii seemaa par siarpief, estf or chhattisgarh police ne naksaliyon ke khilaaf oparation karke kareeb 15 se 20 naksaliyon ko maar giraaya
 The search and kill operations of the CRPF claimed that 350 personnel surrounded 200 Naxals in a three-day anti-naxal operation on May 13, 14 and 15
 is dauraanaliyonor surakshabalon ke bich jamkar golibari hui, jisamen ek jawan bhi shahid hua he
 The place where this anti-naxal campaign was carried out
 wo jagah sukama atake kii jagah ke paas hi he
 Based on this video, the CRPF is claiming to have the largest search and kill operation against the Yenxalias till date, which was carried out to avenge Sukma's martyrs

 Vijay Kumar has been appointed as Naxal Advisor
 ajtak ne ke
 Have exclusive discussions with Vijay Kumar
 is baatcheet main vijay kumaar ne bataaya ki desh se laal aatank ko kaise khallaas kiya jayega
 
 
 We are ready to negotiate with the Maoists without weapons
 grahamantri bhi baatcheet karne ke liye taiyaar hai
 i would like to tell you that Veerappan and Naxal problem are different, but still we have a very good force
 cobra bhi he
 Will always work as a team together with the rest of the states
 commander to ho, lekin commander team ke rup main kaam kare
 Look at the use of modern devices like the common man has a cellphone
 uskaa personal code bhi hota he
 It cannot open automatically
 agar maine aapkaa phone chin liya, to turant use khol nahin paaenge
 Simple code of this type can be in everything
 fries main ho saktaa he
 Can be in the door
 sawaal ye he ki ab tak hamaare javaanon ke hathiyaaron main kyon nahin hua
 This question has been asked by the Home Minister and i also agree with this
 hamaare vaigyanikon ko iskaa tatkaal hal dena chahie
 If there is a personal lock in the weapons, then no one will be able to open the gun immediately
 aisi sthiti main automatic lock ho janaa chahie
 UAV: Eye in the Skyke
 vijay kumaar ne kaha ki jahaan tak yuavi kii baat he, to ise ai in da ski kaha jaataa he
 The biggest thing in this is that there should be good clarity for it day or night
 hamaare paas kai tarah ke yuavi hai, lekin iske bare main saarvajanik taur par bol nahin paaenge, lekin ye kah saktaa hum ki jitna sambhav ho sakegaa ham technology kaa istemaal karenge
 Regarding terrorists like Hidma, Chintagufa or Chintalnar where there is a stronghold of Naxalites
 dhire-dhire ham unke garh ko khatm kar denge
 However, indicators of counter insurgency are that such shocking attacks occur at the last moment
 ye keval bharat kii baat nahin he, ye vaishvik str par he
 We have suffered a lot
 pehle 20 jawan maare gaye
 Then 25 and before that many soldiers have given their martyrdom
 javaanon kii shahadat ko ham bekaar nahin jane denge
 Will eliminate people like Hidma slowly
 naksaliyon ke khilaaf abhiyaan main teen charanhamaari ranneeti ye he ki pehle hamalaa karke khatm kar dena
 The second is to arrest them and the third is to create an atmosphere for surrender
 or ant main shanti sthapit karnaa
 If Hidma ran away from there, that too is a success for us
 baat sirf ek hidma kii nahin he
 There are many Hidma
 shaharon main unke madadgaar banakar rah rahe hai
 Their children are leading a comfortable life in the cities and they help the Naxalites
 aise log bahut khatarnaak hai
 We have to keep an eye on these
 hoshiyaar rahanaa hoga
 Please tell that

 This will help you a lot in working ahead
 5
 Cleanliness and security are required everywhere
 agar aapako offis main koi cheez avyavasthit dikh rahi he to aap use organij kar sakate hai aap offis kaa coffee filter badal kar nayaa pot bana sakate hai
 Throw the used cup in the dustbin
 6
 To be a good employee, you should set short-term goals
 ek target bana len ki itane dinon main yah kaam puraa karnaa he
 By doing this, your image will be good in the eyes of the boss
 7
 Just focus on your work

 Avoid Gossip

 This will make your boss happy with you

 In the last 65 days, passing through every corner of India, covering a distance of 10,000 km, many of the victims gathered at the Ramlila Maidan in Delhi
 aayojak asif shaikh ne kaha ki supreme court ke aadesh ke baad bhi 2 finger test or har jile main van stop chrysis centre nahin banaaya gaya
 Dignity gathered thousands of rape and sexual violence survivors in March
 aayojak asif shaikh kaa daawa he ki bharat ke 25 rajyon ke 250 jilon ke 25000 peedita unke parivaar ke sadasyon ko mobilise karne kaa pehla akhil bhartiya network he
 a survey showed that the number of victims of sexual violence is worryingly high, but 95 percent of sexual violence cases involving children and women are not reported and the victims are embarrassed
 ve samaaj dwaara maathe par kalank lagaae jane ke dar se is bare main kuch nahin kahati
 Especially as far as children are concerned, most of the crimes are not known
 is maamle main lagbhag naa ke baraabar dosha siddhi ho paata he
 It was also found that 95% cases of sexual violence with women and children were not reported
 ghatnaon ke sarkari aankade kam maanya hai
 Since only 2 percent of incidents are reported to the police
 mumbai ke kalyaan main ek vyakti ko bheekh main 5 rupee dena kuch zyada hi mahangaa pad gaya
 a group of youths confronted him for paying only 5 rupees to the beggar and attacked his friends with him with knives
 police ne jaanaleva hamalaa karne ke aarope main do vyaktiyon ko giraftaar bhi kar liya he
 The arrested youths have been identified as 22-year-old Shubham Shetty and 23-year-old Umesh Lamba
 jabaki unka ek anya sahyogi mangesh faraar he, jisaki police talash kar rahi he
 The victims have been identified as 28-year-old Nikhil Shetty, 29-year-old Sanket Bhane and 28-year-old Swapnil Chopra
 hamale main nikhil shetty gambhir rup se jakhmi ho gaye, jabaki sanket or swapnil ko bhi chotein ai hai
 The victims had to undergo treatment at a nearby hospital
 ghatnakhadkapada chauraaheke paas 30 march ko ghati
 Surprisingly, the three youths from the attackers are from financially strong families and had come in the Mercedes at the time of the incident and escaped from the Mercedes after the attack
 peediton ke mutabik, ghatana ke vakt nikhil, sanket or swapnil khadkapada chauraahey ke kareeb icecream kharid rahe the
 Then three more young men came to buy ice cream
 isi dauraan ek vruddh mahila bhikhaarin bheekh maangane ai to nikhil ne use bheekh main 5 rupee de die
 There, one of the attackers gave 20 rupees to the beggar and objected to Nikhil's begging for only 5 rupees
 hamalavar yuvak ne kaha ki ve paise vaale lag rahe hai phir bhi unhonebhikhaarin ko sirf 5 rupekyon die
 When Nikhil said that it is up to his own discretion to decide how much money to give to the beggar and he should not have any deal with it
 is par hamalavar yuvak unase ulajh gaye
 When the dispute escalated, the youths attacked Nikhil, Sanket and Swapnil with knives
 uttar pradesh main yogi adityanath sarkaar ne chah tarah ke bhatton ko khatm kar diya he
 Employees used to take advantage of these allowances from time to time
 yogi sarkaar ke faisle se aath lakh se zyada karmchaariyon ko nuksaan hoga
 The government also issued its mandate on Thursday
 sarkaar kaa kahana he ki jin bhatton ko khatm kiya gaya he, unki ab jarurat nahin rah gai he
 Therefore, these allowances released as per earlier arrangement have now been abolished with immediate effect
 bataa den ki pehle computer sanchaalan va protsaahan bhatta, dwibhashi typing, dwibhashi protsaahan bhatta miltaa tha
 Whereas now it has become mandatory qualification
 isi tarah se store keeper ko nakadi bhandaron va moolyawaan vastuon kii raksha ke evaj main milane vaala cash handlling bhatta, simit parivaar ke prati jaagrukta badhaane ke liye adhiktam ek hajaar rupee kaa parivaar kalyaan protsaahan bhatta, pariyojna bhatta, snatakottar bhatta bhi khatm kar diya gaya he
 Actually, the decision to abolish the six allowances, including voluntary family welfare incentive allowance of employees, was taken in the last cabinet meeting itself, but this order was suppressed keeping in mind the possible resentment of the employees
 yahaan tak ki aakhri cabinet brifing main rajya sarkaar ke pravaktaaon ne keval 18 maamalon par hi nirnay kii jaankaree di thi
 The decision on these allowances was not made public at the time
 magar ab jaakar 22 agast ko sarkaar ne shasnadesh jari kar diya
 100 and 300 rupees per month as bilingual incentive allowance, while 4500 rupees as postgraduate allowance
 bhartiya rashtriya congress party kii sthapana ko aaj 131 saal ho gaye hai
 Today, this party, which has led the country's freedom struggle and ruled India for the longest time, is going through its worst phase
 543 sadasyon vaali loksabhaa main uske mahaj 44 saansad hai
 The party which gave seven Prime Ministers to the country did not even get the post of Leader of Opposition this time
 aaj jabaki party132waan sthapana divasamana rahi he to un kaarnon par najar daalana jaruri he jinke chalate uski ye durgati hui he
 1
 mul siddhanton se bhatkaavcongress se votaron kaa mohabhang hone kaa sabase bada kaaran uskaa apane mul siddhanton se bhatakana mana jaataa he
 Corporate culture came to dominate the talking party of the poor-farmers
 desh main udaarikaran kaa daur narsimha raav sarkaar kii aarthik majaburi ho sakati he lekin usne desh ke saath-saath congress netaaon kaa kalevar or party kaa culture bhi badalakar rakh diya
 This culminated in the rule of the Manmohan government when billions and trillions of scams like 2G, Colgate came to light and the government and corporate alliances opened up in them
 2
 Sporadic Dalit, Backward and Class of traditional voters , Muslims were once considered the core voters of Congress
 lekin ve pi singh ke mandal or bijepi ke kamandal kii raajnneeti main party aise fansi ki na idhar kii rahi or na udhar kii
 The result was a new and independent leadership of these classes
 aaj bahujan samaaj party, samaajawaadee party, janata dal united, rashtriya janata dal, emm jaisi partiyon kaa voter kabhi congress kaa samarpit voter mana jaataa tha
 The same thing can be said about farmer voters because Dalit, backward, farmer leaders in Congress did not get the place they deserved
 3
 The ending of grassroots engagement is a major weakness of the ruling party that its first priority becomes the government and not the organization
 congress ko bhi iskaa nateeja bhugatna padaa he
 Organizations like the Youth Congress and NSUI, once considered to be the strength of the Congress, were marginalized in 10 years of Manmohan's government
 nateeja ye hua ki party us samarpit cader se haath dho baithi jo chunaavon main votaron ko poling booth tak laane or ahm muddon par virodh-pradarshnon ko safal banane ke liye sidhe jimmedaar hota he
 4
 bade muddon par flop shopichley dhai saal kii hi baat karen to congress ko kai baar aisa mauka mila he jab wo sansad se lekar sadak tak bada andolan ched sakati thi lekin modi sarkaar ke khilaaf congress kaa virodh sansad aurrahul kii reliyonki rasaadaaygi tak tikaa hua he
 There is no need to explain how crowds are organized in rallies in the country
 aise main janata se party kaa sidhaa samvaad sthapit nahin ho paata
 This condition is also in the states
 madhya pradesh or chhattisgarh jaise rajya jahaan lambey samay se congress vipaksh main he vahaan bhi congress koi prabhavi abhiyaan sarkaar ke khilaaf chhedane main vifal rahi he
 As a result, after every assembly election, the Congress is moving from state to state one after the other
 5
 Lack of New Leadership In the last two decades, young and capable leaders like Congress Rajesh Pilot, Madhav Rao Scindia, YS Rajasekhara Reddy have died prematurely
 vahiin mamata banerjee, sharad pavaar jaise kshatrapon ne apni alag raah chun lee
 After this, new leadership could not be born in the Congress
 khaskar aisa netaa jo janata se uski bhashaa main samvaad sthapit kar sake
 It is believed that the work and track record of many of the ministers of the Manmohan government is excellent but they did not have the ability to take their work to the public and convey it to them
 congress main raajnneetijna to kai hai lekin rajaneta kii kami kaa khamiyaja party bhugat rahi he
 6
 kaaryakartaaon se judaavcongress main leadership kaa matlab aaj bhi gandhi parivaar yaa sonia gandhi kaa aadhikarik nivas 10 janpath mana jaataa he
 But workers' access to party president Sonia Gandhi and vice-president Rahul Gandhi is limited
 aam netaa-kaaryakarta kii baat to chhodie rajya ke mukhyamantriyon tak kaa sonia-rahul se milanaa aasaan nahin he
 Sonia Gandhi cannot be very active due to health reasons and the big leaders who have recently left the party have said that the biggest reason is the lack of easy access to Rahul Gandhi
 7
 Rahul will become president, but when? Rahul Gandhi is the future of the Congress knows all this, but despite being active in politics for more than 10 years, within the Congress itself, there is no consensus on handing over the party's command to Rahul
 yahi vajah he ki baar-baar rahul kii tajposhi kii taarikh media main aati he or baar-baar congress iske liye sahi samay kaa intjaar karne kii baat kahkar iskaa khandan kar detii he
 The question is, with what confidence should the public or country choose the leader whom the Congress is reluctant to choose as its sole head? 8
 gandhi parivaar par karpshan kaa varazadee ke baad kaa congress kaa itihaas dekhen to ise sabase badi chot rajeev gandhi par boforce top saude main dallali kaa aarope lagane se padi
 The party came out of power and VP Singh became Prime Minister
 iske baad party centre main kabhi bhi purna bahumat se sarkaar nahin bana pai
 The way the opposition attacked Sonia and Rahul for the big scandals in the Manmohan government, in the National Herald case, these two leaders were forced to take bail and the way the Gandhi family is targeted by the BJP in the Augusta helicopter scam
 The image of the family has received tremendous shock
 bachi hui kasar priyanka gandhi ke pati robert wadra par lage aaropon ne kar di he
 In all these cases, the transparency with which the Congress and the Gandhi family themselves had to go among the people did not appear
 9
 Rahul Gandhi's leadership: Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi lacks the charismatic leadership that the nation saw in Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi
 rahul gandhi na to aisa karishma rakhte hai or na hi unamem rajeev gandhi or sonia gandhi jaisi kaabiliyat or sakriyata dikhti he
 In them, there appears to be an innocent politician who has been forcibly handed over the command of the party to carry forward the political legacy of the family
 unki bhalmansahat par sawaal bhale na uthte hon lekin ve janata se samvaad sthapit karnaa nahin jaanate
 Not only this, she also lacks the ability to keep other opposition leaders with her
 iskaa najaara kuch din pehle tab dikhaa jab piem modi par karpshan ke aarope lagane ke agle hi din ve party ke pratinidhimandal ko lekar unase milane pahunch gaye or vipaksh kii notebandi ko lekar sadan main bani ekta tut gai
 10
 ateet kaa bojcongress desh par sabase zyada samay tak raaj karne vaali party rahi he, desh main aazaadee ke baad jo bhi vikaas or achche kaam hue hai wo uskaa shrey leti he lekin isi ke saath use desh kii maujuuda samasyaon ke liye bhi jimmedaar tehraaya jaataa he
 Even today, whenever Prime Minister Modi or his government is targeted by Rahul Gandhi, the BJP advises him to remember the history of his family and party
 lalit modi ke mudde par jab rahul gandhi ne videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj par waar kiye to sushamaa ne unhen anderson or kwatrochi yaad dilaa die
 Congress has no answer to these attacks
 yahaan bhi uski leadership kii aakshamata or anubhavheenata jhalkati he, jiskaa khamiyaja party aaj bhugat rahi he

 ajasu pichhadaa varg kaa aarakshan badhaane kaa mudda shuru se uthaati rahi he

 Shah has clearly tried to play the Hindutva card by raising the issue of Ram temple
 is tarah se bijepi ne ram mandir mudde ke jariye ek baar phir congress ko kathghare main khadaa karne kii koshish kii he
 Referring to the central government's decision to withdraw the status of special state from Jammu and Kashmir through section 370, Dharmit Shah said that the Congress party had been hanging the matter for 70 years in the greed of its vote bank
 lekin pradhanmantri narendra modi ne bharat mata ke maathe par lage anuchhed-370 ke kalank ko hataakar kashmir ke vikaas ke raste khol die hai
 Shah has set the issue of nationalism on the pretext of 370 in the political battle of Jharkhand
 shah ne khelaa obisi cardjharkhand main pichde samudaay ko saadhane ke liye amit shah ne obisi aarakshan kaa daanv chalaa he
 Shah said that the BJP would mention in its manifesto to increase the scope of OBC reservation
 sarkaar banane ke baad cameti kaa gathan kar aarakshan badhaane kii disha main prayaas kiya jayega
 Let me tell you that the OBC community is currently getting 14 percent reservation in Jharkhand, the demand for making it 27 percent has been rising since the beginning
 is baar ke chunaav main congress-jeemem obisi mudde ko apana sabase bada siyaasi hathiyaar bana rahi he
 Not only this, AJSU, which is an ally of BJP, is also in favor of increasing reservation of backward classes
 aise main amit shah ne bhi obisi card khelte hue pichhadon ke liye aarakshan badhaane kaa vaada kiya he
 Shah's tribal wager Amit Shah also targeted JMM working president Hemant Soren and said, "to whom are Hemant sitting, who fired bullets at the youth to gain power
" unhone kaha ki congress ne adivasee samaaj ke vikaas ke liye koi kaam nahin kiya
 Atal ji created a separate tribal ministry
 desh ke adivaasiyon ke liye bijepi khule dil se kaam kar rahi he
 Explain that 30 percent of the voters in Jharkhand are from tribal communities

 You might like to see rain sitting in the house in monsoon, but you can be worried about your look while going out in the rain
 visheshgyon kii maane to barsaat ke mausam main ghar se baahar jate vakt agar kuch jaruri chijen bag main rakh lee jaaen to is phikr se mukti paayi ja sakati he
 Anuj Lalwani, stylist of 'fashionandyou

 is mausam main paseene se judi dikkatein or bimaariyaan aam hai
 In this case, wash face daily during the day
 baahar se lautne ke baad ek baar cheharaa jarur saaf karen
 Anti-bacterial facewash is better used
 -wet wips:ho saktaa he ki offis main hameshaa cheharaa dhul paanaa sambhav na ho
 In this case, choose alcohol-free and anti-bacterial wipes
 bazaar main vitamin si, alovera or gulab jal vaale wet wips bhi uplabdh hai jo chehre ko na keval saaf balki tarotaaja bhi karte hai
 -powder: Use plain powder instead of foundation in monsoon
 pasinaa aane par foundation aapke luk ko matiamet kar saktaa he
 At the same time, getting wet in the rain can also make you discolored
 -waterpruf iliner or kaajal:barish main liquid iliner kaa prayog karne se bachein
 It will flow in rain or sweat
 isaki jagah waterpruf kaajal yaa smaj free (na failane vaale) gel liner ko apanaaen
 It would be good to apply kajal and eye liner lightly in the rain
 -chaataa:is mausam main aapke bag main ek pyaara or majboot chaataa hona behad jaruri he
 You can use eye-catching and beautiful umbrellas for a strong style statement

 com / w0tmdzoma1 German company mercedes-benz, which makes luxury cars, has introduced a new car in its s class
 isaki dilli main keemat 1
 57 crores (x show room)
 yani local tex vagairah lagaakar yah car on road paune do karod rupee se bhi zyada kii hogi
 Eberhard Kern, MD and CEO of Mercedes Benz in India, said that we are launching this car in India only three months after the launch of this car in the international market in October last year
 company is car ko puri tarah se emport kar rahi he lekin kuch samay baad ise bharat main hi assembl kiya jayega
 Kern said that the company has sold 125 cars of this new version so far
 local assembl kii jane vaali kaaron ke liye advance booking bhi kii ja rahi he
 His delivery will begin in April
 es-class kii is nai car main 4
 The 6 liter V8 engine is installed
 yah car adhiktam 250 kilometre prati ghante kii raftaar se chal sakati he
 It seems like it was only yesterday, but this thing is going to be gradually over a decade
 ham garmi kii chhuttiyon main apane ghar-gaanv ke ghoshit mehmaan hote
 Guests because we were thrown out of our own homes and villages in order of education
 gaanv pahunchane par na juute-chappal kaa hosh rahata or na hi kapadon kaa
 Either fly Guddi throughout the day (note that in up-bihar, you know kite is called Guddi) or prepare a pitch for cricket in the field
 is sabase fursat milane par apane or padosiyon ke chhaton yaa ahaaton se shishe kii puraani bottlen, laalaten yaa lamp ke toote-phute shishe ke alaavakatile lohe va aluminiumke taron ko chura kar gaanv kii galiyon main ghoomane vaale kabadi ko bech dena
 In those days Sonpapadi used to be found in exchange for that junk
 jise ham "budhiya" ke pake bal bhi kehete
 What did Sonpapadi also look like? duniya ke saare mishthann uske saamne pani bharte
 On his own the friendship would remain and the enmity for him would be tarnished
 kabadi bhi jaanata ki ham sonpapadi ke premi ho gaye hai or vah hamaare anhad prem kaa galat phayda uthaata
 He would be well aware of the fact that we get all the junk from somewhere or say that we steal it
 vah is baat kaa puraa phayda uthaata or hamen thodi sisonpapadithama detaa
 At first, we would throw at him, but he would look at us as if he would tell us all our differences
 ham bhi aakhir kya karte
 The rebellion would have opened up if we had rebelled and we would have been deprived of our heartfelt sonpapadi
 ham aksar samjhauta kar lete or apana sa munh lekar chalate banate
 All our friends follow us and we walk in front of them without a crown
 kabadwaala saare toote-phute bartan le jaataa
 Many times we would intentionally break things
 badhati umr ne wo sahaj bachapan chin liya
 What were those days also? ab kabhinaat-rishtedaarya parivaar ke sadsy sonpapadi lekar chale bhi aate hai to unamem wo test nahin aata
 Those beats do not have to be upside-down and sweaty
 sab-kuch hota he magar wo pakade jane kaa dar or sonpapadi haath main aane ke baad vijay kaa bhav nahin hota
 i wish that day would return

 sidney main khele gaye vanade siries ke pehle match main australya se mili haar ke baad ek baar phir wicketiper ballebaaj mahendra singh dhoni kii batting par charchaa ho rahi he
 Some people also consider Dhoni's slow innings as the reason for the defeat
 is bich vanade team ke captain rohit sharma ne dhoni ko lekar captain viraat kohli se alag bayaan diya he
 Contrary to the opinion of captain Virat Kohli, Indian ODI captain Rohit Sharma said on Saturday that Mahendra Singh Dhoni has the ideal number four position in the batting order
 bhartiya team vishwa cap se pehle ballebaaji kram ko tay karne main lagi he or rohit ne kaha ki yah unki nijee raay he, aakhri faisla captain or coach kaa hi hoga
 Dhoni scored 51 off 96 balls in the first ODI against Australia on Saturday and India lost the match by 34 runs
 isse dhoni kii vartmaan farm ko lekar phir se bahes shuru ho gai he
 Rohit, who scored a century in the Indian innings, said in the press conference, 'personally i believe Dhoni's batting at number four would be an ideal situation for the team but we have Ambati Rayudu who is really doing well at number four is
 yah puri tarah se is par nirbhar karata he ki captain or coach is bare main kya sochate hai
 Ask my personal opinion, i would be happy to field Dhoni at number four
 ' haalanki, isse pehle viraat kohli ne number chaar ke liye rayudu ko apni pasand bataaya tha
 Rohit said, 'if you look at Dhoni's overall batting, his strike rate is close to 90
 aaj paristhiti bhinn thi
 When he came to bat, we had lost three wickets and Australia were bowling very well
 aap shatkeey saajhedaari aasaani se nahin nibhaa sakate
 So we spent some time at the crease and even i could not score fast
 'unhone kaha
 'I too took some time because we wanted to pursue this partnership
 agar ham us samay ek or wicket ganvaa dete to match vahiin par hamaare haath se nikal jaataa
 So we let the balls go empty and focus on the partnership
 'match se pehle dhoni ko ‘team kaa prakashpunj’ qaraar dene vaale rohit ne iske saath hi kaha ki yah purv captain team ke liye kisi bhi sthaan par ballebaaji karne ke liye taiyaar he
 He said, "it is very simple for him and he does not make things complicated
 hamane saajhedaari nibhaane par baat kii kyonki tab yah jaruri tha
 "rohit said," We knew that we can bring the bowlers under pressure
 durbhaagya se hamane galat samay par wicket ganvaaye
 The first three wickets and then when we looked in a strong position due to partnership, Dhoni was out and after that we felt that it would be difficult to reach the target now

 As the interest rate rises by one to two per cent (short-term debt-money market), the scandals of the scam begin to tear up the balance sheets of the companies and open the bar for regulators (ratings, auditors)
 punjab neshnal bank ko neerav modi ke jatke ke ek saal ke bheetar hi kai vittiya companiyaan (ab to ek textile company bhi) karj chukaane main chukne lageen
 • IL&FS, one of India's largest financial companies, lost bank debt at the end of 2018 and a vicious cycle of default began

 Short-term (one year or less) loans are the life force of the Indian business world
 inamen antar bank, bank va vittiya company, mutual fund or vittiya company, enbiensi or companiyon ke bich karj kaa lenden shaamil he jo vibhinn madhyamon (sidhe karj, bond yaa commercial paper) ke jariye hota he
 As long as there is easy credit, the promoters of companies keep using and hiding it in arbitrary ways
 unki balance shit or reating chamakdaar dikhti he
 But when loans are expensive, the vicious cycle of default in their business chain begins
 badi companiyaan aamtaur par apane share yaa sampatti ke badale karj leti hai
 In the crisis of inflation, their price falls and the lending banks increase the recovery pressure
 neerav modi, mehul chokasee jaise maamle iskaa udhaaharan hai
 With a good growth rate in the economy, companies keep earning and they get short-term loans, but with the onset of the recession, banks look at the results of the companies and raise the interest rate and the crisis breaks

 mananeey adhyaksha ji,pichley kuch dinon kii ghatnaon se main bahut vyathit hoon
 i have been deeply hurt by some aspects of the current situation
 ham sab bhrashtachar kii vyapaktaa ko jaanate hai
 Corruption is at every level
 garib vyakti par iskaa sabase zyada boj padataa he, kintu is boj se har bhartiya chhutkaaraa paanaa chahta he
 To eradicate poverty, fighting corruption is as important as enacting laws like Mahatma Gandhi NREGA or land acquisition
 yah hamaare desh kii tarakkee or pragati ke liye behad mahatvapurn he
 Honorable President, mere desire cannot free our lives from corruption
 bhrashtachar ko mitaane ke liye ek vyapak ruparekha ko karyanvit karne or ek sangathit sarvasammat raajnneetik kaarykram ko upar se lekar neeche tak karyanvit karne kii jarurat hogi
 The most important thing is that it will require political will
 mananeey adhyaksha ji, pichley kuch varshon main maine desh ke kone-kone kaa daura kiya he
 i have met hundreds of people in the country, whether poor or rich, old or young, strong or disabled who have expressed disenchantment with the system
 hamaari vyavastha se upje rosh ko anna ji ne aawaaj di he
 i thank them for this
 main samajhataa hum ki hamaare saamne sahi sawaal yah he ki kya ham janpratinidhi bhrashtachar ke khilaaf is sidhi jang ke liye taiyaar hai? yah sawaal keval is gatirodh ke thamane kaa nahin he
 This is a big fight
 isamen koi saral upaay nahi hai
 To eradicate corruption, constant commitment and deep engagement is needed
 pichley dinon kii ghatnaon kaa sakshi hone par kadaachit aisa prathit hota he ki ek kanoon ke ban jane se jaise puure samaaj se bhrashtachar mit jayega
 i have deep doubts about this
 ek prabhavakaari lokapal kanoonee taur par bhrashtachar ke khilaaf ladane kaa ek madhyam he
 But the Lokpal alone is not a sufficient option for corruption-free conduct
 kai prabhavakaari kanoonon kii jarurat he
 Laws that address some important issues simultaneously with the Lokpal - 1
 chunaav or raajnneetik dalon kaa sarkaar dwaara vittiya sanchaalan
 2
 saarvajanik kharid main paardarshita
 3
 bhoomi evam khanan jaise maamalon kaa sahi niyaman jiske abhaav main bhrashtachar panapata he
 4
 nunatam samarthan mulya, rashan card or vriddhavastha pension jaisi saarvajanik vitaran sevaaon main samasya nivaaran kii prakriya ke liye ek vyapak tantra bananaa or 5
 Continuously improving the tax system to get rid of tax evasion
 ham samaybaddh tareeke se sansadeey prakriya ke madhyam se dal gat raajnneeti se upar uthakar aise kanoon banane ke liye desh kii janata ke prati patibaddh he
 We discuss a Lokpal regulator but our discussion comes to a halt on the accountability of the Lokpal and its state of corruption
 mananeey adhyaksha ji, ham kendriya chunaav praadhikaran kii tarah sansad ke prati javabdeh sanvaidhanik lokapal ke gathan par charchaa kyon nahin kar sakate? mujhe lagata he ki is par gambhirtha se vichaar karne kaa samay aa gaya he
 Honorable President, law and institution is not enough
 bhrashtachar se ladane ke liye pratinidhitiv- kaari, samaveshi or sugam loktantr kii jarurat he
 Many people have inspired and agitated the people of the country for freedom and progress of the country
 kintu vyaktigat bhaavana chaahe kitne bhi achche uddeshy ke liye ho, usase loktantric prakriya kamjor nahin honi chahie
 This process is long and difficult, but its length is necessary for it to be inclusive and fair
 vah prakriya ek paardarshee or samaveshi madhyam bane jisase vichaaron ko kanoonee rup diya ja sake
 It is the elected government that preserves the highness of Parliament
 nitigat ghuspaith sansadeey ucchata ko nasht karegi or yah loktantr ke liye bahut khatarnaak hoga
 Today the proposed law is against corruption

 main na to khemka kaa paksh le rahaa hum or na hi unke khilaaf hum, lekin is tabadale se bijepi kaa doharaa cheharaa saamne aayaa he
 On the other hand, Aam Aadmi Party spokesperson Ashutosh said, "both BJP and Congress party are equally corrupt, so officers like Khemka are a threat to both and honest officers like them are in trouble
" khemka ke karibiyon kii maane to unhone disambar main aadesh jari kar tay maanakon se zyaada bhaar vaale vaahanon par sakhti karne kaa adhikaar jila afasaron ko de diya tha, jisase khanan lobby behad khafa thi
 There is no opinion in the government on his transfer
 swasthya mantri anil vij ne kaha, main khemka ke saath hum, unke tabadale par main mukhyamantri se baat karuunga
 He fought against corruption in the Congress Raj
 jabaki mukhyamantri manohar laal khatter ne kaha, khemka eemaandaar afasar hai, lekin unka kahaan istemaal karnaa he, ye sarkaar kaa kaam he
 However, it is astonishing that the government which considers Khemka to be honest, has been delaying the revocation of the Hooda government's charge sheet against him for the last four months while the CAG has cleared Khemka's proceedings in its report

 chaara ghotaale ke ek maamle main ranchi ke vishesh sibiai adaalat dwaara doshi qaraar die jane ke baad birsa munda jail main band argedy supremeo lalu prasad yadav ke upar unke virdohi lagaataar hamale kar rahe hai
 Significantly, Lalu has been convicted but it will be known on January 3
 aise main lalu kaa nayaa saal birsa munda jail ke andar hi manegaa
 JDU has taken a dig at Lalu Prasad for this and has said that Laluhar sets a new record after a few years and this time Lalu will set a new record by celebrating the start of the new year in prison
 lalu kaa nayaa saal jail main banegaa isko lekar jadyu ke varisht pravaktaa sanjay singh ne tanj kasate hue kaha he ki agar birsa munda jail ke andar family jail kii suvidha he to lalu parivaar ko is vikalp par sochna chahie taaki lalu apane parivaar ke saath nae saal kaa jashn manaa sake
 Sanjay Singh said that Lalu's family should celebrate the new year inside the jail along with Lalu by taking advantage of the convenience of family as Lalu has finally gone to jail for the sake of the family
 sanjay singh ne kaha ki lalu apane parivaar ko zyada se zyada paisa kama kar dena chaahate the or isi vajah se vah ghotaale par ghotaalaa karte rahe or aaj sthiti yah ho gai he ki vah jail main he or unke parivaar ke log baahar benami akut sampatti bachaane main lage hai
 Sanjay Singh said that since Nitish Kumar became the Chief Minister in 2005, there was an outbreak of criminals and corrupt people from Bihar and perhaps because of this there is no land of Bihar for the corrupt and people like Lalu are lodged in the jail of Jharkhand
 
 sanjay singh ne kaha ki lalu ko aatm chintan karnaa chahie ki unhone apane jivan main kya-kya kiya he
 On Saturday, Lalu had also tweeted a tweet in which he said "what happens to gold when it is heated", which simply means that he is currently in jail and is meditating like gold and when he If you get out of jail, you will come out as pure gold
 isi ko lekar sanjay singh ne kaha ki lalu shaayad yah nahin jaanate hai ki zyada sona tapane ke baad vah kaala ho jaataa he
 Sanjay Singh said that Lalu should think what finally came in his hands after earning black money? The JDU spokesperson said that first Lalu lost power in Bihar, after that he went to jail and now his party is also going to go out of hand
 sanjay singh ne kaha ki lalu ke party ke tamaam netaa ek ek kar kar party chhod denge or ant main lalu jis parivaar main janme the usee parivaar ke saath rah jaaenge
