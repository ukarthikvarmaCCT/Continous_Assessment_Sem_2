 Congress star campaigner Navjot Singh Sidhu is again accused of disappearing from Amritsar
 unka ek video aajkal amritsar main viral he
 The video is from "the Kapil Sharma Show" aired on Sony TV channel, in which Rishi Kapoor arrived as the chief guest and Navjot Singh Sidhu also returned to the show after the Punjab elections were held
 is cliping main navjot singh siddhu ye kah rahe hai ki 'ek abhinayta 3 ghante tak cinema kii screen par logon ko bevakoof banaata he or ek netaa jivan bhar janata kaa bevakoof banaata rahata he'
 Navjot Singh Sidhu, who arrived in Amritsar a few days before the Punjab election, and his wife Navjot Kaur Sidhu had claimed that now Navjot Singh Sidhu will stay in Punjab and work for Punjab and in Punjab politics, but he will return to Mumbai as soon as the elections are over
 Went for shooting
 ab is video ko lekar amritsar kii janata or vipakshi partiyaan aam aadmi party or akali-bijepi ne bhi navjot singh siddhu ke khilaaf yah kahkar hallaa bol diya he ki navjot singh siddhu har baar chunaav se pehle yah kahkar amritsar kii janata se vot hasil kar lete hai ki ab wo punjab or amritsar main rahakar punjab kii janata ke liye kaam karenge, lekin chunaav jitate hi wo apni shooting ke liye mumbai or videsh chale jate hai or ek baar phir siddhu ne chunaav nipataane ke baad janata se kiye apane vaade ko tod diya he or wo phir ek baar punjab se gaayab ho gaye hai or mumbai jaakar apni shooting main biji ho gaye hai
 Before the elections in Punjab, Navjot Singh Sidhu, who was the focal point of politics, was the target of all political parties in the elections, but even after the elections are over in Punjab, Sidhu is now on the target of political parties, calling himself a servant of Guru Ghar Valle Sidhu and his wife had said that Sidhu will live among the people of Amritsar after the election, but after the election he quickly moved to Mumbai and The Kapi l Sharma was seen on the 81st show of Rishi Kapoor's family show
 vahiin iske baad ab punjab main aap or bhaajapa ne un par nishaanaa saadhaa he or kade aarope lagaae hai

 haalanki modi or bhaajapa ne 2014 main purna bahumat hasil kiya tha lekin loksabhaa kii kul 543 siton main se 282 siton kii jeet ko doharaana naammumkin-sa lagata he
 This means that regional parties will emerge as decisive in the formation of a new government at the center
 aakhir, 2019 ke janadesh ke liye kshetreey jang jeetna itnaa mahatvapurn kyon ho gaya he? isaki mukhya vajah yah he ki haal ke ke vidhansabha chunaavon main hindi pattee ke teen rajyon madhya pradesh, rajasthan or chhattisgarh kii satta congress ke haath ganvaane ke baad bhaajapa or narendra modi-amit shah kii ajey chhavi par sawaal khadey ho gaye hai
 These three states have 65 Lok Sabha seats out of which BJP won 61 seats in 2014
 agar in rajyon main haal ke vidhansabha chunaavon ke vot pratishat ko aadhaar banaakar hisaab lagaaein to bhaajapa 2014 kii apni jeet ke aankade kii aadhi sankhya tak hi bamushkil pahunch paaegi
 There are other states where the BJP may find it difficult to repeat its major victory
 gujarat bhi aisa hi he, jahaan pichhali baar bhaajapa ko sabhi 26 loksabhaa siton par ekatarfa jeet mili thi
 In the state assembly elections held in 2017, it got a strong fight with the Congress
 yah chetavanee thi ki bhaajapa ab modi ke grih rajya ko halke main nahin le sakati
 Perhaps the party's biggest concern is Uttar Pradesh, where in 2014 the BJP won 71 out of 80 seats and its ally Apna Dal won two seats
 samaajawaadee party (sapa) or bahujan samaaj party (basapa) ke bich ab gathbandhan ho chukaa he, aise main anumaan lagaae ja rahe hai ki bhaajapa kii siton kii sankhya 2014 ke mukaable aadhi rah jaaegi
 This means that the BJP is in danger of losing at least 100 seats compared to 2014
 bhaajapa ke liye utsahjanak yah he ki india today-exis maai india political stock exange ke janamat surveykshan main modi abhi bhi adhikansh rajyon main pradhanmantri pad ke liye sabase lokapriy vikalp bane hue hai (tamilnadu hi aisa rajya he jahaan lokapriyata ke maamle main modi se aage rahul hai)
 But it will be difficult for the Prime Minister to convert his popularity rating into votes
 aisa isliye he kyonki in surveykshanon se yah bhi sanket miltaa he ki jab baat matadaataaon ko pareshaan karne vaale sabase pramukh muddon kii aati he to berogari sab par bees padati he
 After this, the number of farmers in most states comes in trouble
 pulavama hamale or balakot hawaii hamalon ke baad suraksha or aatankwaad ke mudde ranking main upar aae hai lekin ye sattarudh dal ke voton main ek choti badhat hi de sakate hai kyonki votaron ke dimag main chintaa ke anya pramukh kaaran ab tak yathaavat bane hue hai
 This suggests that the fight will be fought on a number of issues and concerns and not on a national issue
 yahi kaaran he ki chunaav visheshgyon kaa kahana he ki 2019 ke aam chunaavon main kshetreey dalon kii badi bhoomika hogi or bahumat ke kareeb pahunchane ke liye akele chalane ke bajaay sooyeeboojh se taiyaar kii gai ranneetik saajhedaari phydemand rahegi jaisaa bhaajapa ne 2014 main kiya bhi tha
 Due to this, the war of regions has been heated
 iskaa sanket isse bhi miltaa he ki bhaajapa or congress donon hi badi betaabi se gathbandhan karne kii disha main bad gai hai
 Then, whether it is in the north, south, east, west or central region, both parties are engaged in assuring the old allies and bringing new allies together
 dakshin main, bhaajapa ne annadramuk ke saath gathbandhan kiya he
 The reason is that the party won only 22 seats in 130 seats of the six southern states (tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Kerala and Puducherry) in 2014, out of which 17 were from Karnataka alone
 is bich, andhra pradesh main party ne apni sahyogi telegu desham party ko bhi ganvaa diya he, jisane 16 siten jiti thim
 For the Congress which won 23 seats in these states in 2014, it will be equally important to conquer the fort of the South

 ) It can be said that with the Congress's departure from Mizoram, Amit Shah's dream of a Congress-free Northeast was fulfilled but there is no reason for the President of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to be happy
 40 sadasyeey vidhansabha vaale rajya main do baar mukhyamantri rah chuke joramthanga kii kshetreey party mizo neshnal front (emenef) ne 26 siten jeet lee hai
 The MNF is a member of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) at the Center and the Northeast Democratic Alliance (NEDA), an organization of bjp-led non-congress parties in the Northeast
 isi vajah se enidie ke sanyojak tathaa assam ke vitt mantri hemanth biswa sarama ise bhaajapa kii kamyaabi ke taur par pesh karne kii koshish kar chuke hai
 In his words, "with the victory of the MNF in Mizoram, the governments of the NEDA member parties will be in the entire Northeast
 ham pradhanmantri narendra modi kii aguai main is makasad ke liye pichley teen saal se athak mehnat kar rahe hai
 However, the unilateral success of the MNF is probably not good news for both Sarma and Shah
 bhaajapa ko yah bakhubi ilm tha ki vah is isai bahul rajya main apane dam par kabhi satta main nahin aa sakati
 So he thought of repeating the miracle of Meghalaya here too
 meghalaya main mahaj do vidhayakon ke boote vah sarkaar banane main ahm kirdaar ban gai thi
 This was a really ambitious plan of the party, which had lost 17 candidates in 2013 by winning 17 candidates in Mizoram and only 0
 4 pratishat vot hasil kar pai thi
 This time the BJP had hoped that the assembly would be hung and MNF would need the help of other parties to keep the Congress away
 isi ummid main usne parade ke peeche se nagaland ke mukhyamantri ke netritv vaali nesanalist democratic progressive party (andipeepi) or meghalaya ke mukhyamantri conrad sangama ke netritv vaali neshnal piples party (enpipi) ke ummidavaaron ko khadaa kara diya tha, taaki ve emenef ke kuch vot kaat len
 But both parties could not achieve anything and the BJP had to be content with only one seat
 bhaajapa kaa vot pratishat jarur badhkar 8 pratishat ho gaya
 But the mnf's unilateral victory could not interfere in forming the government
 joramthanga ne kaha he ki unki party tay karegi ki endie or enidie main rahaa jaae yaa nahin
 Even before this, the friendship between BJP and MNF was not comfortable
 masalan, is saal april main bhaajapa chakma swytt jila parishad main chah congress sadasyon ke samarthan se kabiz ho gai
 His motive was to keep the MNF away from power
 yah 74 varshiya joramthanga ke liye satta main duusari vaapasi kii tarah he
 He lost to the Congress in 2008 after ruling for ten consecutive years and his party won only three seats
 uske paanch saal baad bhi unki party mahaj paanch siten hi jeet pai
 In fact, in 1959, the MNF was formed by the famous Mizo leader Laldenga, angry at the central government's disregard for the Mizo people during the famine
 emenef kii maang alag rajya yaa alag desh banane tak kii thi
 The MNF started attacking government offices and security forces from the early 1960s
 aakhirkaar 1986 main centre ke saath shanti samjhaute ke baad emenef baagi sanghathan se rajnatik party main tabdeel hua
 On June 30, 1986, after signing the peace deal, Zoramthanga came out of his hideout and became a minister in the Laldenga-led government
 1990 main laladenga kii mrityu ke baad joramthanga emenef ke mukhiya chune gaye
 He still continues in this position
 joramthanga ke netritv main emenef ne 1998 main vidhansabha chunaavon main jeet hasil kii thi
 He himself won from two regions Champhai and Khabang and formed a government with 21 mlas
 2003 ke chunaavon main bhi ve satta par kabiz hone main kaamyaab hue or mukhyamantri bane rahe
 It was necessary for the Congress to win this time in Mizoram as the party government survived in this one state of the Northeast
 vahiin abhi do saal pehle tak purvottar ke aath main se paanch rajyon main congress kii sarkaar thi
 The country's oldest party won 34 seats in the 2013 assembly elections in Mizoram
 lekin is baar use sirf paanch siton se santosh karnaa padaa
 Chief Minister Lal Thanhawla fought from two seats Champhai South and Serchhip and lost in both seats
 unki yah apmanjanak haar congress se logon kii naaraazgi ko hi darshaati he
 The 76-year-old Lal Thanhawla has served as chief minister five times, a record in Mizoram
 mizoram main congress kii haar kii mukhya vajahen satta-virdohi rujhaan or sharabbandi ko aanshik taur par hataane jaise kuch vivaadaaspad faislon ko bataaya ja saktaa he
 Due to the widespread influence of the Presbyterian Church, there has been a long-standing demand for a ban on the sale of alcohol
 iske liye sehat ko nuksaan or naitik aagrah jaisi daleelein di jaati rahi hai
 But despite opposition from the Church, the Congress government believed that a complete ban on liquor would lead to increased black marketing and sale of spurious liquor

 It was also feared that if Srinivasan tried to return to the post under these circumstances, there would be a revolt against him

 Srinivasan was unhappy with this possibility, but after consulting his legal team, he agreed to cancel the meeting
 baithak ke radd hone ke peeche ek or takneekee kaaran tha ki kaarysmiti ke sadasyon ko jab isaki soochna di gai to ‘apaat’ shabd kaa istemaal nahin kiya gaya tha
 The comments board ke ek adhikari ne kaha, baithak takneekee rup se bhi avaidh thi, kyonki yadi pichhali baithak se 72 ghante ke bheetar koi duusari baithak bulani he to apaat shabd kaa istemaal jaruri he

 (input ieenes se bhi) (also from input IANS) bhartiya janata party ke rashtriya mahasachiv ram madhav kaa kahana he ki anuchhed 370 sirf kashmir ke liye mudda he, lekin jammu or ladakh kshetra main nahin
 Because Kashmir has powers that do politics on it
 isi se unki raajnneeti chalati he
 There is no hue and cry over 370 in Ladakh and Jammu
 india today conklev main jammu-kashmir ke masale par baatcheet karte hue ram madhav ne kaha ki anuchhed 35A sansadeey prakriya ke tahat nahin joda gaya he, balki raashtrapati ke aadesh par joda gaya he
 Right now the matter is in the Supreme Court, Parliament will take a decision when the court decides
 bijepi netaa kii maane to 1947-48 ke dauraan bharat main shaamil hui sabhi 540 riyaasaten vishesh hai, isamen keval kashmir ko jodakar nahin dekha ja saktaa he
 Hyderabad is also special
 lekin keval kashmir ko special kaise kah sakate hai
 He said that former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru also said that article 370 is for some time, it is not possible forever
 lekin ab kashmiri netaaon ko lagata he ki is khatm hote hi ghati main unki raajnneeti bhi khatm ho jaaegi
 Ram Madhav said that Article 370 was brought so that the people of Kashmir became part of India, so it is special
 lekin hyderabad ke log bhi isi prakriya ke tahat bhartiya ganraajya kaa hissaa bane to unhen kyon nahin mila, unhone kaha ki bijepi hameshaa se 370 ko hataane ke paksh main he
 According to the BJP General Secretary, in the last 5 years, the central government has been successful on many fronts in Jammu and Kashmir
 hamane badi sankhya main aatankwaadiyon kaa safaya kiya, aatankiyon ke over ground saport ko khatm kiya
 Along with this, remarkable work was done on the development front
 aaj kashmir kaa bada hissaa shant he
 He said that when it is mentioned in article 370 that the leaders of the state come out against it, they have more concern with their politics than the people there, they feel that if special state status is over, then their politics also ends It will be done
 ram madhav ne kaha ki hamaari kashmiriyon se koi ladaai nahin he
 Our fight is against those who want to disturb Kashmir, who spread violence in Kashmir
 piem modi ne bhi kaha he ki kashmiri hamaare hai
 What is Article 35A Article 370 of the Indian Constitution actually gives special status to the state of Jammu and Kashmir
 anuchhed 35A, dhara 370 kaa hissaa he
 Because of this, any citizen of other states can neither buy property in Jammu and Kashmir nor can live there as a permanent citizen
 saath hi agar kashmir kii koi ladki baahar shaadi karti he to use bhi sampatti se haath dhonaa padataa he
 The petition filed in the Supreme Court has sought to abolish this privilege
 yani jammu kashmir ko jis vajah se vishesh darja mila hua he usamen 35-e kaa bhi ahm yogadan he

 patidaar andolan ke netaa hardik patel ne ghoshnaa kii he ki is shanivaar tak agar sarkaar unhen ulti dandi yatra, yani dandi se ahmedabad ke sabarmati ashram tak kii yatra nikaalane kii manjuuri nahin degi tab bhi ve kisi vakt yah yatra nikaalenge
 The yatra will be taken out in support of the demand for inclusion of Patidars in the Other Backward Classes for the benefit of reservation
 jahaan dandi or aasapaas ke ilaakon main rahane vaale anya pichhadaa varg ke log is tarah kii kisi yatra ko manjuuri na dene kii maang ko lekar virodh karte aa rahe hai vahiin gandhi vichaar se jude log aahat mahasoos kar rahe hai
 Dhimant Badiya has lived in Sabarmati Ashram since the days of his great grandfather
 unke pardada ne gandhiji ko soot kaatna sikhaaya tha
 Not only this, he also accompanied Gandhiji in 1930 in Dandi
 pichley kuch saalon main dhimant badhia bhi kareeb 5 baar alag-alag group ke saath dandi yatra kar chuke hai
 Dhimant says that in 1933 Gandhiji called the Sabarmati Ashram as Harijan Ashram
 yahaan ab bhi zyaadaatar log jo rah rahe hai, ve pichde hai
 Gandhiji wished that this ashram should be set up only in the salvation of the backward in future
 lekin bahut dukh kii baat he ki patidaar, jo samrudh samaaj kaha jaataa he, vah pichhadon ke saath apane aapako shaamil karwaakar aarakshan ke unke haq main hissedaar bananaa chahta he
 Not only this, support for Gandhiji's name or Dandi Yatra is being taken for this demand
 kuch saal pehle gandhiji kii dandi yatra par dacumentry bana chuke televijan film nirmaataa manishi jaani kehete hai ki mahatvapurn baat yah he ki gandhiji kii dandi yatra ke mukhya kartadharta sardaar patel hi the

 unako aage badhaane ke liye madad pradaan karen
 He had said that the Patidar society is Paras and work to bring backward people from Parasmani
 dukh kii baat he ki vahi patidaar samaaj aaj ulti dandi yatra nikaalkar uske vipareet maang bhi kar rahaa he

 dhimant badhia apane pardada ke jamaane se sabarmati ashram main rahete hai
 His great-grandfather had taught Gandhiji to spin cotton
 itnaa hi nahin ve dandi yatra main 1930 main gandhiji ke saath chale bhi the
 In the last few years, Dhimant Badiya has also traveled to Dandi with different groups about 5 times
 dhimant kehete hai ki 1933 main gandhiji ne sabarmati ashram ko harijan ashram kaha tha
 Most of the people still living here are backward
 gandhiji kii ichha thi ki is ashram ko bhavishya main pichhadon ke uddhaar main hi lagaaya jaae
 But it is very sad that the Patidar, which is called a prosperous society, wants to become a part of their right to reservation by involving themselves with the backward
 itnaa hi nahin, is maang ke liye gandhiji ke naam yaa dandi yatra kaa sahaara tak liya ja rahaa he
 Television filmmaker Manishi Jani, who made a documentary on Gandhiji's Dandi visit a few years ago, says that the important thing is that Sardar Patel was the main actor of Gandhiji's visit to Dandi
 aaj sardaar patel ke naam kaa hi patidaar samaaj upyog kar rahaa he
 The comments jaani ne kaha ki jab gandhiji yatra ke dauraan patidaar bahul gaanvon main gaye to vishesh taur par unako hidaayat di thi ki ve samrudh hai isliye pichde varg ke unke kheton main mazaduri karne vaale logon ke liye kaam karen
 Provide help to take them forward
 unhone kaha tha ki patidaar samaaj paras he or parasmani se pichhadon ko aage laane ke liye kaam karnaa he
 Sadly, the same Patidar society today is also taking the opposite Dandi Yatra and demanding the opposite
 ab dekhnaa he ki gandhivichaar se jude logon kii is pratikriya ke baad patidaar samaaj apni dandi yatra ko lekar kya rukh apanaataa he

 Army intelligence satellites indicated that the Army's two regiments, including pla's Type 96 battle tanks and cannons, were camping on the Tibetan plateaus near the pillar Dajong town, about 30 km from the border
 unka yuddhayas asaamaanya rup se may se tab tak teen maheene tak chalaa tha
 Worried about this, the Indian Army noticed that they were just 10 km from the northern border
 pathaar kaa vah sapaat or chaida ilaaka bakhtarband tinkon ke yuddh ke liye adarsh jagah hoti he
 For this reason, the Indian Army has already stationed itself there since 2009 with two regiments of T-72 tanks and BMP armed carriers

 The purpose of this unusual activity of army units so close to the border was to show that India is fully prepared for a war with Beijing

 Thus, on August 28, when the PLA started encasing its tents and recalling its bulldozers from the world's most disputed road — along which the two big countries of Asia were face to face for 72 days — it was a great relief for India
 It was a matter of aapasi samjhaute ke baad donon pakshon ne apni sena ko vivaadit jagah se 180 meter peeche hataa liya
 However, one of the major reasons for the PLA retreat was that the BRICS conference to be held in Xiamen was successfully concluded

 Conversely, Indian planners feel that Beijing may take a decision after the party conference

 So on September 8, when a four-hour flag meeting was going on between the Major General of the Indian Army and his Chinese counterpart in the red-roofed conference hall near Nathu La Pass, the mood was in complete joy
 bhartiya sena ke adhikari ne piele ke apane samakaksh se kaha ki sirf sadak nirmaan kaary rokna hi kaaphi nahin he, yathasthiti tab hi behaal ho paaegi, jab piele us sthaan par waapas laut jaaegi, jahaan vah 16 june se pehle thi—kareeb 1
 5 km back to Merug la-cinche La Ridge Line
 yah meeting us ghatana ke kareeb teen maheene baad hui thi, jab bhartiya sena ne bhutani seemaa ko paar kar china ko sadak nirmaan se khud rokane kaa abhootpurv kadam uthaaya tha
 The army had to take this step because after the construction of this road, the PLA would have access to the Jamferi Ridge, from where India's sensitive Siliguri corridor is very close, also known as 'chicken Neck'
 Because it carries the risk of Chinese military attack from the Tibet Plateau
 doklam ab donon deshon ke bich takaraav kaa nayaa centre ban gaya he or yahaan aag phir bhadakne kii ashanka bani hui he, khaskar nai laal rekhaon ke khinche jane ko dekhte hue
 "there is no question of allowing road construction," said an army officer
 
 
 iske liye ham apni jaan de denge
 "but by building a bunker in two ridges, China is looking for a place below these redlines and is making its presence known," China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Hua Chunying indicated in his August 29 statement
 
 hua ne kaha ki china, ''apane kshetreey adhikaron or hiton kaa istemaal kar rahaa he or apni kshetreey samprabhutaa kii raksha kar rahaa he
 "these construction will make it easier for the Chinese Army to lay claim to the entire plateau and it can go up to Jamferi Ridge
" himalayan chaisar ab yuddh ko nyotaa de rahaa he
 Two meetings have been held since August 28 and India is trying to repel Chinese troops from the road
 pehali meeting, brigadier rank ke adhikariyon ke bich 30 agast ko hui thi, us gatirodh main kami aane ke baad, jab bhartiya sena ne aath chini sainikon ke us jagah par jhanda gadwe or uske paas rahane par aapatti kii thi
 Two days later, the Chinese withdrew, but took a position again on a ridge along the plateau
 nathu laa main hui 8 sitambar kii flag meeting 29 agast ko gatirodh dur hone ke baad duusari baar he, jab piele sadak se 180 meter dur chali gai thi—torasa naala ke peeche jahaan pehle bhi chini gashti dal aate rahe hai
 The Indian Army is waiting for what the PLA does during the winter, when the plateau will be completely covered with snow in November and December
 haalanki ve iskaa uttar bhi jaanate hai: piele kaa khel bada he
 Why does PLA remain in Doklam? China's attempt to disturb the status quo in the Chumbi Valley can be understood by looking at the military map there
 yah torasa nadi kii ghati he jo ki bhutan main bhi bahati he or vahaan use amo chhu ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 The western part of the narrow valley is dominated by India, while the east is Bhutan
 bharat kaa maananaa he ki uske, tibet or bhutan ke bich kii seemaa bataang laa ke dakshin main us trikon se nirdhaarit hoti he, jo merug laa-sinche laa point 4421 kii taraf se aage jaataa he or uske baad chomo lhari rij ke uttar-pashchim kii taraf se
 But China insists that the triangle of the border lies on Gemochen

 Panag says, "the Doklam plateau gives the PLA such an advantage that it can defeat the defense of the Indian Army in Sikkim, where India has a lot of advantage for geographical reasons
" ''unhone kaha, ''iske nihitarth samrik hai
 Not only have we lost our major advantage of retaliation for the strategic attack / attack from Sikkim, but we have also given the PLA a launch pad of aggression to attack the Rangpo river from Kalimpong towards Bhutan without disturbing the neutrality of Bhutan
 Can
 ''bhutan main ghuspaith shiviek sainya adhikari ne bataaya ki doklam se 150 kimi dur uttar-purv main bhutani ilaake main piele kya kar rahi he? pashchimi bhutan main china ke teen ghuspaith shivi hai, jo ki saat kimi andar tak hai or shahi bhutani sena ke apane shivi se bahut dur nahin hai
 All these camps have been built at the time when the Doklam standoff continued
 ateet main chini gashti dal shaayad hi kabhi bhutani chaukiyon tak aate the or aate bhi the to waapas chale jate the
 But after the Doklam dispute, he has stayed there
 sena adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki doka laa main gatirodh ke baad chini sainikon kii gasht kaaphi bad gai he
 And this is the most worrying thing
 china madhya kshetra main bhutan ke kareeb 495 varg kimi ilaake par or pashchimi bhutan main doklam sahit 269 varg kimi ilaake par apana daawa jataata he
 Each of the three Chinese-made infiltration camps in western Bhutan can house a platoon of about 30 soldiers (see graphic) and includes infrastructure and tents, permanent white-roofed white buildings, and communications trenches from which the Firing During this, soldiers get the facility to change the place
 ek sena adhikari kehete hai, ''chini yahaan pashchimi bhutan main thaharne aae hai
 Today some of the infrastructures are of a temporary nature, but they cannot be denied in future
 ''in gahari ghuspaith ke bare main bhartiya sena kuch nahin kar sakati
 Bhutan has not made any formal opposition to them, nor has it sought any help from the Indian Army
 doklam ke vipareet, jo doka laa main bhartiya sena kii ek chaowkee se sirf 100 meter dur he, is ilaake se bhartiya sena kaaphi dur he or isliye madad mushkil he
 Furthermore, these new Chinese incursion camps are not a direct threat to the Indian security situation on the ground
 ek sarkari sutara ke mutabik, nae chini ghuspaith or bunker nirmaan kaa masalaa haal main bhutan sarkaar main 'ucch str par' uthaaya gaya he, lekin is par koi jawaab nahin mila he
 However, Bhutan is somewhat cautious in this matter, as it does not want to take the risk of offending its huge neighbor to the north (the Bhutanese embassy has not responded to our questions about the comment)
 jaankaar china sarkaar ke is kadam se chakit nahin hai, jise piele kii 'khuli dabangai' kaha ja rahaa he
 "I think the PLA will infiltrate this to keep Bhutan under pressure," says Ranade
 uskaa uddeshy yah ho saktaa he ki bhutan ko china ke saath purna rajanyik sambandh banane ko raji kiya ja sake or nikat bhavishya main use bharat kaa samarthan karne se roka ja sake
 "that is, China wants to take Bhutan completely under its control
" chumbi main ghuspaith shivi or doklam main sadak nirmaan piele kii is vrihad yojana kaa hissaa he ki sankari chumbi ghati main apni maujuudagi kaa vistaar kiya jaae, jo bharat or bhutan ke bich ek anguuthe kii tarah ubhara he
 The Army believes that these outposts were constructed to widen China's eastern road that leads down to the Chumbi Valley
 yah sadak philhal bhutani kshetra ke bilkul kareeb he
 The Indian Army has prepared a wartime emergency plan for its mountain division, which will take a defensive position along Bhutan's western border in the event of an attack in China's Chumbi Valley
 lekin yudhkaal kii apaat yojana nishchit rup se shanti kaal kii jarurat nahin ban sakati
 It seems that the situation in Doklam and its surroundings is not going to return to normal soon
 unhone kaha, 'lekin unke vahaan pahunchane se pehle mahila ne sadak par bachche ko janm de diya

 adwani ne kaha, ‘gathbandhan dharm keval nitigat maamalon main myne rakhata he na ki eemaandaaree ke maamle main
 Recalling the days of the NDA coalition government, Advani said that his government had created new states without any problems but the Telangana case was postponed as consensus was needed among all allies
 adwani ne kaha, ‘rajg jab satta main thi us samay meri party telugana rajya ke samarthan main thi lekin hamaare sahyogi iske paksh main nahin the
 The BJP also criticized the government for failing to rein in the rising rate of inflation, due to which it has become difficult to raise basic facilities of life

 or jisase captain, coach or team management ke sadsy bhi use puraa sammaan dete hue uski khinchaai na kar saken
 Binny had presented the present picture in a way in gestures
 baharhaal, vishwa cap 2019 ke bare main unhone kaha ki isamen do raay nahin ki dhoni team kii pehali pasand ke wicketiper honge, lekin duusare vikatkiper ke rup main rishabh pant ko team main jagah milani chahie
 Binny said that Pant has done better in T20 and odis
 or unhen aage or zyada bharosa die jane kii jarurat he
 Note that after the Test series, India will play three odis against Australia
 iske baad bhartiya team paanch vanade or teen tii-20 khilne ke liye newjiland daure par jaaegi
 At the same time, advising injured players Mari Team India, Binny said that playing Hardik Pandya in the XI in Melbourne can make a difference in the match
 hardik ne pichley dinon mumbai ke khilaaf ranjai trophy match khelkar vaapasi kii thi
 In this match, he also scored a half-century, taking five wickets including five in the innings
 binni ne kaha ki number saat yaa aath par aisa khilaadi ho, jo gend or balle donon se yogadan dene kii kshamta rakhata ho
 And Hardik Pandya can score 30-40 runs regularly
 isse nishchit taur par nichle kram ko majbootee milegi
 Binny said that having an all-rounder in the team is always a good thing
 or hardik donon bhoomikaayen nibhaa saktaa he
 He is the most important player in the team
 binni yahaan yah kehane se nahin chuke ki haalia samay main bhartiya team ne oleroundaron ko zyada ahmiyat nahin di he
 On the 22nd of August, when the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) was leading a protest at the Jantar Mantar in Delhi over the current situation in Kashmir, at the same time the central office of the BJP was assessing what was the issue of Kashmir
 Can BJP make inroads in Tamil Nadu? Three BJP general secretaries and two Union Ministers, who were involved in the assessment, finally came to the conclusion that the issue is suitable for making inroads in Tamil Nadu
 rajya ikai ko kaha gaya ki sitambar kii 1 taarikh se lekar 30 taarikh tak kashmir ke mudde (anuchhed 370 ko nishprabhavi banane) ko aazaadee ke baad desh ke liye sabase badi uplabdhi ke rup main ghar-ghar tak jarur pahunchaaen
 BJP leaders say that 'one country, one constitution' was the dream of every Indian
 kashmir se anuchhed 370 hatane se yah sapana puraa ho gaya he, jo aazaadee ke baad desh kii sabase badi uplabdhi he
 Therefore, the BJP will run a public awareness campaign across the country and tell people about it
 sabhi rajyon kii rajdhani sahit 35 bade sthanon par kaarykram kiya jayega or tear-2 yaa tear-3 ke 370 shaharon main bhi yah abhiyaan chalaaya jayega
 This number signifies Article 370 and Clause 35A
 kendriya mantri dharmendra pradhan kehete hai, ''yah kaarykram puure desh ke liye he or har rajya main ise samarthan milegaa
 This is fixed
 ''bhaajapa tamilnadu main ek darjan shaharon main yah janajagran kaarykram chalaaegi
 a senior Tamil Nadu BJP official says, "it has been clearly stated by the central leadership that this program is an opportunity through which the BJP can make inroads into the state on its own, so no one should be offended
" '' tamilnadu kii raajnneeti ke jaankaar en
 Says Ashokan, "the national sentiment is one on which the spirit of Tamil Nadu is associated with the country
" isliye agar kashmir ke mudde ko bhaajapa rashtriya bhaavana se jodgaye main safal rahi to dakshin ke is rajya main party apni jagah banane kaa mauka paa sakati he
 "the way the DMK goes to Delhi and takes a stand against the central government on the Kashmir issue is like giving a platform to the BJP to start discussing Kashmir in Tamil Nadu itself," says Ashokan

 vahiin tirankara ke shrikrishna swami mandir main yojit ek or samaaroh main 16 log hindu ban gaye
 Pillai said that the converts belong to Vaikom, Kumarakkam and Kanjirapalli and had converted to Hinduism on their own volition
 anya sthanon par bhi aise samaaroh yojit kiye ja rahe hai
 On Wednesday, 11 people embraced Hinduism near Kayamkulam in Alappuzha district

 ---input bhashaa se On the third day of Sahitya Aaj Tak, former Union Minister Jairam Ramesh attended the stage of Dastak Durbar
 'ek thi indira' satr main bolte unhone desh kii purv pradhanmantri indira gandhi ke faislon par apni baat rakhi
 Jairam, who was the environment minister in the Manmohan government, said that Indira Gandhi has two faces, people praising one and criticizing the other but the real Indira was not a political figure
 jairam ramesh ne kaha ki indira gandhi ko raajnneeti kaa shauk nahin tha, lekin raajnneeti main unka janm hua, pali-badhin or ant tak raheen lekin wo pehle rup main paryaavaran premi thim
 Speaking on his book, Jairam Ramesh said that his book is only on that environmentalist Indira
 jairam ramesh ne kaha ki indira sirf paryaavaran kii yaa sirf vikaas kii baat nahin karti thim wo balance kii baat karti thim kyonki unka kahana tha ki hindustan viksit nahin, balki vikasshil desh he
 In the literature Aaj Tak, he said that the first World Environment Conference was held in June 1972 in Stockholm, where only one head of state was present and that was Indira Gandhi
 us samay paryaavaran kii baat karnaa bahut mushkil tha
 Talking about it at that time was unique in itself
 us dashak main jo kanoon bane wo aaj bhi hamaare saamne hai
 Our policies have been made on the basis of their laws
 unhone indira gandhi kii tarif karte hue kaha ki vah paryaavaran ke maamle main doordarshee thim
 Jairam Ramesh said that Indira's contribution is historical
 koi bhi unka yogadan nahin mitaa saktaa
 Some of his decisions were positive but there are also decisions like Emergency where he is criticized
 unhone kaha ki aaj main mathura rifinary nahin lagane detaa lekin us vakt ke halaat bahut alag the
 Indira was the first and last Prime Minister of the country who used to be so concerned about the environment
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ke netritv par bharose ke bare main puche gaye sawaal par jairam ramesh ne kaha ki vah hamaare adhyaksh hai or rahenge
 Nobody doubts this
 gujarat, karnataka ke chunaav ke samay unhone jo kiya usapar kisi ko shaq nahin he
 His strategy, the election campaign, is beyond doubt for Congressmen
 kya pradooshan ko lekar modi sarkaar ko koi kadam utaney kii jarurat he is sawaal kaa jawaab dete hue jairam ramesh ne kaha ki pradooshan kii samasya sirf dilli main nahin he
 This is a problem even in small towns
 yah ek saal main nahin badalegaa
 Many steps will have to be taken for this
 aaj sabhi log yah maanakar chalate hai ki vikaas kii jarurat hai, lekin koi bhi yah nahin kahata he ki paryaavaran ko praathamikta mat do, lekin ham jo bhi faisle lete hai uskaa asar 5 se 10 saal baad maaloom padataa he
 Replying to the question of the most powerful PM, he said that Indira Gandhi was powerful and in 2014 PM Modi also got majority
 agar janadesh mila he to piem jarur taqatvar hai
 Jawaharlal Nehru got the mandate 3 times
 vah bhi taqatvar the
 He said that in my view Indira Gandhi was the first and last PM who gave such priority to the environment
 kisi piem kaa paryaavaran par itnaa dhyaan dena badi baat thi
 She always used to say that there is balance between environment and development
 paryaavaran ke maamle main unke kaarykaal main banaae gaye kanoon aaj bhi he

 Jung has reported in his report that the 20-year-old Dua is studying law at the University of London and according to his Facebook profile he is also affiliated with a global organization voicing for women's rights
 dua ko ravivaar der raat us samay agava kiya gaya jab vah apane dost haaris somaro ke saath chahalkadami kar rahi thi

 E-rickshaws are included as 'motor vehicles' under the Motor Vehicles Act
 isliye in par 28 fisadi jiesti lagaaya jayega
 The Authority for Advanced Ruleings (AAR) has made this point clear in its order
 eear kii maharashtra-khandpeeth kii taraf se yahorder us aavedanke jawaab main aayaa he, jisamen tair nirmaataa siyat limited ne i-rickshaw par lagane vaale jiesti ko lekar tasviir saaf karne ko kaha tha
 The company had asked whether e-rickshaws can be included in the category of three-tire cycle rickshaws or not? Actually these rickshaws attract 5% GAT
 iske jawaab main eear ne kaha kii-rickshaw main pedal nahin hai, jo 'teen pahiyaa saaikal rickshaw' ke rup main shaamil hone ke liye jaruri he
 The AAR stated in its order that under the Motor Vehicles Act, e-rickshaws are motor vehicles and local transport authorities have registered as public vehicles
 isliye yah bahut spasht he ki i-rickshaw or cycle sanchalit rickshaw ek nahin balki do alag-alag vasteen hai
 Under the current GST law, it is clear that tire cycles used in e-rickshaws are not rickshaw tires
 isliye kuch nirmaataaon, kaarobaariyon aurayatkon dwaara chargeke taur par liya jane vaala jiesti 2
 The highest rate of GST is 14%, not 5%
 bataa den ki jiesti ke tahat tex centre or rajyon ke bich samaan rup se saajha kiya jaataa he
 Hence, 5% GST including Central GST and State GST is levied on pneumatic tires or inner tubes used in two wheel and three wheel cycle rickshaws
 haalanki naye neumatic tiron par 28 fisadi jieti lagaaya jaataa he

 But JDU leader KC Tyagi says that if the BJP needs time, we would not mind giving time

 Nandini said, 'she did well in the exam, but was not expecting that she would top it
 ' Nandini told, 'first of all his friends told me that i have topped, but i thought friends are joking, because they had done such jokes earlier too, but this time it came out true
 ' nandini ne kaha ki aap kis becoground se hai, koi fark nahin padataa
 You should prepare with full dedication in front of your goal, trust in yourself

 ek ghante ke baad ham faridabad ke us training centre main pahunch gaye jahaan nandini training le rahi thim
 i felt that perhaps i was the first to arrive for an interview, but, as soon as i entered inside the training center, there were many journalists already waiting for Nandani
 maine nandani ke bare main poocha to kisi ne bataaya ki nandini neeche mess main hai
 When i entered the mess, i saw a girl talking to someone on the phone
 vahaan intazaar kar rahe patrakaron ne kaha ki yahi nandini he
 Nandini was giving an interview through phone
 phone se mukt hote hi patrakaron ne nandani ko gher liya
 After a while my number also came
 nandani ne bade hi aaraam se mere sabhi sawaalon ke jawaab die
 Many times we see that most of the toppers give credit to their family first but Nandini first gives credit to the society and then to her family
 nandini ne bataaya ki uske pita sarkari skool main teacher hai or maa gruhani
 She was preparing for this exam for the last four years and this was her fourth attempt
 jab nandini se poocha gaya ki jo log ladakiyon ko boj maanate hai unke liye kya sandesh he
 Nandini said that there should be no difference between girls and boys
 agar aap donon ko mauka dete hai to khud hi dekh sakate hai ki ladki kitna aage nikal sakati hai
 Nandini said, 'she did well in the exam, but was not expecting that she would top it
 ' Nandini told, 'first of all his friends told me that i have topped, but i thought friends are joking, because they had done such jokes earlier too, but this time it came out true
 ' nandini ne kaha ki aap kis becoground se hai, koi fark nahin padataa
 You should prepare with full dedication in front of your goal, trust in yourself
 nandini se baat karne ke baad story karne ke liye main fouran offis aane vaala tha
 i felt that only Nandini would have topped here
 lekin mess ke andar aise kai ladke mili jo toppers kii list main the
 It was a surprise for me to meet so many toppers in one place

 Despite being an engineer, Abhilash chose public service as his subject
 vah bataate hai ki yah jaruri nahin ki safalataa aap ko turant mil jaae, kitni bhi mehnat karo, ho saktaa he ant main aap ko niraashaa hi jhelni pade
 Everyone does not get success soon, should be constantly trying for it

 When Nandini was asked what is the message for those who consider girls as a burden
 nandini ne kaha ki ladki or ladakon main koi fark nahin karnaa chahie
 If you give both of them a chance, you can see for yourself how far the girl can get ahead
 nandini ne kaha, 'unhone exam main to acha kiya, lekin ummid nahin kar rahi thim ki vah top kar jaaengi
 ' nandini ne bataaya, 'sabase pehle unke doston ne bataaya ki maine top kiya he, lekin mujhe laga ki dost majaak kar rahe hai, kyonki ve pehle bhi aise majaak kar chuke the, lekin is baar yah sach nikaala
 Nandini said no matter which background you are from

 Abhilash said that children who want to start preparations for civil services should talk to successful people, they should talk to experienced people
 jo log civil services main safal nahin ho paae hai, un se bhi baat kerani chahie kyonki unke paas anubhav he
 The comments vah bataate hai ki safalataa main gidence kii bahut badi bhoomika hoti he or jo log taiyaari kar rahe hai agar, unke paas koi bhi naukari he to use nahin chhodana chahie kyonki, is pariksha main mehnat ke saath-saath bahut saare duusare factor bhi hote hai

 aavanton ke tahat kol block paane vaali 142 companiyon ke khilaaf sibiai ko kai saboot mili hai
 According to information received by sources from NDTV, the CBI is going to file criminal complaints against five of these companies this week, and they can be raided at any time
 in companiyon par aarope he ki unhone apni keemat ko lekar galat aankade die, or kol block aavanton ke liye apni keemten badhaakar bataayin
 According to sources, these companies are also accused of hiding the fact that they were allotted coal blocks earlier
 is maamle main aise kai sarkari adhikariyon par bhi gaaj gir sakati he, jinhone galat tareeke se kol block aavanton ke liye saazish kii
 In fact, according to CBI officials, such allotment was not possible without the connivance of government officials
 sutron ke mutabik in companiyon par yah bhi aarope he ki unhone yah baat chhipaai ki unhen pehle bhi kol block aavantit kiye gaye the
 In this case, there may be a lot of fallout on such government officials, who conspired for wrongful allocation of coal blocks

 chunaav najadik he kejariwal kaa jahaaj doobane vaala he ek taraf jahaan logon ko ghar mil rahaa he to log saste laalach main jane vaale nahin hai
 Vijender Gupta lashed out at Kejriwal and said that we would say take what you are getting from this outgoing government as they are sure to go
 vijendra gupta ne daawa kiya ki bijepi yadi satta main aegi to dilli ke lagbhag 600 camp main rah rahe jhuggivaasiyon ko unke apane ghar die jaaenge
 Vijendra Gupta said that slum dwellers have been surveyed in some areas and all their documents have been taken on record

 Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi has once again targeted not only the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) but also the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) through her official Twitter account
 apane taaja twit main unhone aresas ke mansoobey ko khatarnaak bataaya he

 beete ravivaar ko mohan bhagwat ne kaha tha ki jo aarakshan ke paksh main hai or jo iske khilaaf hai un logon ke bich is par sadbhavnapurna maahaul main baatcheet honi chahie
 Bhagwat had said that he had spoken on reservation earlier too, but this created a lot of uproar and the whole discussion deviated from the real issue
 haalanki congress or basapa jaisi vipakshi partiyon ne bhagwat kii is tippanee ko lekar bijepi or iske vaicharik sanghathan aresas par prahaar kiya tha
 After which the All India publicity head of the RSS Arun Kumar said in a tweet, 'as far as the Sangh's opinion on the subject of reservation, it has been clarified many times that Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST), others The Backward Classes (obcs) and (RSS) fully support the reservation of backward on economic grounds
 'sangh ne kaha ki vah mahaj is aavashyaktaa par bal de rahe the ki samaaj main sadbhavnapurvak paraspar baatcheet ke aadhaar par sabhi prashnon ke samaadhaan dhunde jaae
 Arun Kumar had said in the tweet that unnecessary controversy is being raised on a part of Mohan Bhagwat's speech given at an event in Delhi
 Yeh bohut achi Khabar hai, isse Padne ke liye mein bohut Khush hoon, india mein appse bohut pyar karta hoon aur aapke jaanwaro se bhi bohut pyar karta hoon

 is baar loksabhaa chunaav main dilli ke purvaanchali voter sabhi partiyon ke liye ahm hai
 To woo this class, BJP, Congress and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) have made Purvanchali leaders their face in the state's politics
 hariyaanvi or punjabi varchasv vaali dilli kii raajnneeti ab purvaanchali votaron ke ird gird gum rahi he
 There was a period in the politics of Delhi when traditionally the leaders of Punjab and Haryana came to dominate
 jat, gurjar, or punjabi voter har chunaav main ahm the
 For a long time issues related to Punjab and Haryana also dominated the politics here
 dilli ke pehle teen siem madanlaal khurana, sahib singh verma or sushamaa swaraj ye teenon netaa hi haryana or punjab kii prishthbhumi se aakar rajdhani kii siyasat main shikhar tak pahunche
 The equation of the politics of Delhi has changed in the last decade, with the increase in the number of people looking for employment from Bihar and Eastern Uttar Pradesh i
e
 Purvanchal, their interference in politics has also increased
 ek anumaan ke mutabik dilli main lagbhag 35 fisadi matadaata purvaanchali hai
 That is, Purvanchali voters have the ability to influence the outcome of the seven seats in the capital
 isi ahmiyat ko dekhte hue bijepi congress or aap teenon hi partiyon ne purvanchal se aae netaaon ko partiyon main ahm pad die hai
 BJP state president Manoj Tiwari comes from Bihar and also has a good interference in politics here
 congress ne mahabal mishra ke jariye in votaron ko saadhane kii koshish kii he
 Apart from this, leaders like Dilip Pandey and Gopal Rai also come from UP and Bihar
 sabase bada sawaal ye ki is baar ke loksabhaa chunaav main purvaanchali voter kiski taraf jaaenge
 To investigate this question, the team of Delhi Aaj Tak got the mind of the Purvanchali voters on the north-east and South Delhi seats of the capital
 pehle baat uttar -purvi dilli kii jahaan purvaanchali votaron kii sankhya ek anumaan ke hisaab se 40 pratishat se bhi zyada he
 The current MP from here, Manoj Tiwari, Bihar is himself Purvanchali
 south dilli par bhi purvaanchali votaron kii sankhya 15 pratishat se zyada he
 Here Ramesh Bidhuri of BJP is the sitting MP
 is baar unka muqabla congress ke vijender singh or aap ke raghav chaddha se he
 Here the opinion of the Purvanchali voters is different for their MP
 yahaan log apni samasyaon ko lekar pareshaan bhi hai
 Actually both Manoj Tiwari and Ramesh Bidhuri are BJP leaders but both leaders have been face to face in the party many times in the battle of Purvanchali vs local leaders
 chaahe wo chhath ghat kaa vivaad ho yaa purvaanchali kaaryakartaaon par bidhudi samarthakon par marpet kaa aarope lekin ab chunaav sir par he to purvaanchali voter kii ahmiyat ko dhyaan main rakhte hue sabhi partiyaan inhen apane saath jodne kii harsambhav koshish kar rahi hai
