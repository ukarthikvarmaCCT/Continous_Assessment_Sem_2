 The number of backward, Dalits and women in the judiciary, he said, the recent decisions that have come from the Supreme Court, it reinforces that there is a need to change the manner of appointment of judges in some judiciary and also to restore the judiciary
 Is required
 kushvaha ne kaha ki khud bharat ke raashtrapati ramnath kovind kah chuke hai ki is samay desh kii nyaaypalika main mahilaon, daliton or pichde varg ke logon kii sankhya behad kam he or ise thik karne kii jarurat he
 He said that his party has been demanding for this before, but recently the decision given by the Supreme Court regarding Scheduled Castes
 uske baad is baat kii or zyada jarurat mahasoos ho rahi he
 'it is difficult to become a judge of the common people' Upendra Kushwaha said that there is resentment against this decision of the Supreme Court in the people and they feel that until every class is represented in the higher judiciary, similar decisions will continue to come
 
 kushvaha ne kaha ki baat sirf aarakshan or kisi jati vishesh kii nahin he balki is samay jajon kii niyukti kaa jo tarika he, usase sirf vahi vyakti nyaaypalika main jaj ban pate hai, jinke parivaar kaa koi vyakti pehle se nyaaypalika main ho yaa phir vah kisi bade rasookh vaale parivaar kaa ho

 com / cdbbk5zhkn — ICC (@ICC) July 6, 2019 Dhoni, who has been 38 years old, should not be criticized but appreciated at this crucial stage of his career
 team main nae khilaadiyon ke aane ke kaaran unhen na sirf apane khel ko behatar rakhana padaa, balki unhone team india ke world cap mishan-2019 ke liye bahut pehle hi nayaa captain bhi de diya
 Yes! Mahendra Singh Dhoni has already contributed two and a half years to the current World Cup and his campaign is still going on
 darasal, unhone janvari 2017 main captaini (simit overon ke praaroop se) chhodane kaa faisla kiya or viraat kohli ko apana uttaradhikari banane kaa rasta banaaya tha

 com / dwbrqde2cl — BCCI (@BCCI) July 7, 2019 Dhoni's departure from captaincy was nothing short of a shock for Indian fans, as Dhoni suddenly took the decision
 haalanki yah pehali baar nahin tha, jab dhoni ne bina koi bhanke lage captaini chodi ho
 In December 2014, Dhoni suddenly left Test captaincy in the middle of the series against Australia
 itnaa hi nahin unhone test cricket se tatkaal ritair hone kii bhi ghoshnaa kar di
 In September last year, Dhoni revealed that - 'I resigned from the captaincy because i wanted the new captain (virat Kohli) to have enough time to prepare a team before the 2019 World Cup

 com / Smsfv67h77— BCCI (@bcci)july 7, 2019sachai to yah he ki tab dhoni se kisi ne kaha nahin tha ki vah world cap ke liye nayaa captain taiyaar karen
 This decision was 100 percent his
 tab tak 283 main se 199 vanade main captaini kar chuke dhoni kaa maananaa tha ki nae captain ko uchit samay die bina ek majboot team kaa chayan karnaa sambhav nahin he
 And he had also prepared himself mentally to play under the captaincy of Virat in the interest of the team
 viraat kohli bhi kah chuke hai, 'jab main pehali baar bhartiya dressing room main gaya tha tab dhoni mere captain the
 Today, of course, i am the captain of the Indian team, but for me, he will always be my captain

 In the election of the new President of the Indian Council of Social Science Research, ie, ICSSR, there has been a case of huge disturbances, due to which the existence of the entire Council has come under the purview of ethical and legal disputes
 khabar he ki parishad kaa nayaa chairman chunane main parishad ke kuch divangat sadasyon ne bhi bhoomika nibhaai
 In fact, the Council's 244 scholarly collegium includes 12 scholars who died years ago
 hairaani kii baat to yah he ki jab 2014 main collegium kaa gathan kiya gaya or ye naam shaamil kiye gaye tab bhi ve vidwaan smritishesh hi the
 These people include ICHR, former chairman of the Indian Council of History Research, BR Grover, AR Kulkarni and RS Sharma, including former director of the Nehru Memorial, Ravindra Kumar, who had gone to the other side only a decade ago
 ICSSR main naitik paraabhav or kanoon ko taak par rakhane kaa purana itihaas rahaa he
 When the Lok Sabha elections were announced to be held in the country on March 19, 2014, the then UPA government should not have taken any moral step to reshuffle the council
 lekin tab ke maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantri kapil sibbal ne chunaavon ke elaan ke kareeb maheene bhar pehle hi professor sukhdev thoraat ko council chairman ke rup main duusare kaarykaal kaa inaam de diya
 Sibal made the first amendment to the Memorandum of Association i
e
 the Council's Legislation in the 45-year history of the Council on 24 March 2014, immediately after the election was announced and sent to Thorat
 jis par council ne bhi apatkaaleen baithak bulaakar teen dinon ke bheetar sanshodhan ko manjuuri de di
 According to this amendment, the Council was bound to be re-constituted
 haalanki yahaan dilachasp baat yah he ki jis sanshodhan kii aad main collegium bana, sadsy sachiv kii niyukti hui or ab chairman professor bibi prasad kenyuktibhi ho gai
 But as per the first condition of the same amendment approved in Afratfari, neither the Sibbal nor Thorat nor the current HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar could reconstitute this council
 nayaa adhyaksh kaa chunaav bhi puraani council hi kar rahi he, jo sanshodhan paas hone ke baad naa keval avaidh he balki aniatik bhi
 After the amendment is approved by law, all the decisions taken by Thorat and the Council, all the appointments are illegal
 nae sanshodhan ke anusaar, council kaa nae sire se gathan karne kii jagah, puraani council ne collegium system maan liya or 244 vidwaanon ko is collegium main shaamil kar liya
 Seven of these scholars had gone to heaven only from 2001 to 2013
 vahiin council kii agar baat karen to, yahaan professor wike malhotra sadsy sachiv banaae gaye
 After this, in the election for the post of president in 2017, Professor Bibi Kumar joined this post
 is chunaav kaa vakt aane tak collegium ke divangat sadasyon kii sankhya 12 tak pahunch gai
 There were 110 nominations for the new president, but even then the council did not notice the late members of the collegium
 council ke 27 vidwaan sadasyon ko bhi is bare main pataa nahin chalaa, jabaki do divangat vidwaan to khud isiesasar ke purv chairman rah chuke hai
 In such a situation, the same question now stands in the light of morality and legalism, whether these activities are a mistake or a crime? Whether the government conducts an inquiry or if the court decides on it

 Masood Azhar was eventually declared a global terrorist
 lambey samay se bharat is koshish main tha ki aatankwaadi sanghathan jaish-e-mohammad (jeiem) ke pramukh masood ajahar ko vaishvik aatankwaadi ghoshit kiya jaae jisamen shuruaati kai naakaamiyon ke baad bharat ko us samay kamyaabi mili jab sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad (yuanessi) ne buudhvaar ko vaishvik aatankwaadi ghoshit kar diya
 Come, let us know for what reasons China had to bow down and India got this great success
 yuanessi main masood ajahar par pratibandh lagane ke baad videsh mantralay ne buudhvaar ko kaha ki aatanki gut jaish-e-mohammad sargana masood ajahar ke khilaaf karrwai bharat ke rukh ke anusaar hua he
 This action has been taken only on the basis of information shared with the members of the sanctions committee of the Security Council
 masood ajahar par vaishvik aatankwaadi ghoshit karne ke maamle main china hameshaa se adanga daalata rahaa he, lekin is baar use apni haar manani hi padi
 India's diplomatic efforts After the terrorist attack in Pulwama on 14 February, India started its efforts to declare Masood Azhar as a global terrorist globally
 bharat ne duniya ke kai deshon main masood ajahar or uske aatanki gatividhiyon ko lekar jaankaree saajha karnaa shuru kar diya tha
 India sent its special representatives to many countries in this regard
 saath hi kai deshon ke saath is sambandh main dweepaksheeya vaarta ke jariye dabaav banaata rahaa
 India's greatest success with Masood Azhar came in the second week of March when China stressed the need for serious discussions before declaring Masood Azhar as a global terrorist
 iske jawaab main america ne china se kaha tha ki agar masood ajahar ko vaishvik aatanki ghoshit nahin kiya jaataa to iskaa asar kshetreey shanti par padegaa
 When the resolution against Masood Azhar could not be passed in the UNSC on March 13, 2019, it was said by the US that it was considering another route
 france ne bhi yah kaha ki vah jaish sargana par ankush lagane ke liye duusare vikalpon main sahyog karne ko taiyaar he
 China had earlier rejected and rejected its proposal on three occasions
 lekin china kii ore se gambhir charchaa kiye jane sambandhi bayaan ke baad america ne bharat kaa saath diya
 After this, France and England also came in support of it
 yuanessi main america, france or england lagaataar is par ek raay rahe
 On the other hand, China's international pressure was constantly on China
 sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad (yuanessi) main china kii tarah sthaayee sadsy or kareebi dost rus ne bhi china par khaasaa dabaav banaaya
 Russia kept constant pressure on China against Masood Azhar to give his consent to declare him a global terrorist
 rus ke alaava indonesia ne bhi is maamle main apni ahm bhoomika nibhaai

 agasta westland maamle main bichauliye chrishchiyan mishael dwaara khulaasa kiye jane ke baad raajnneeti tej ho gai he
 In this regard, Union Minister Arun Jaitley has attacked Congress President Rahul Gandhi in a befitting manner
 unhone kaha ki RG, FAM or AP aakhir koun hai or congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi par apni baat kyon nahin rakh rahe hai? rahul gandhi tamaam muddon par baat rakhte hai, lekin is par chuppi kyon saadh rakhi he?jetali ne kaha ki congress adhyaksh aise muddon par bhi bolte hai, jinke bare main kuch jaanate tak nahin hai
 They also accuse everyone of baseless accusations, but this is the only issue about which Rahul Gandhi is refusing to speak anything, even though he knows the truth of the matter
 kendriya mantri ne kaha ki rahul gandhi ne bhrasht logon ke saath deal kii
 Then to suppress its news, the media imposed censorship
 unhone kaha ki switzraland kii police ne heskhe ke awaas se kuch dastavejon ko jabt kiya tha
 After this, the CBI started investigation in the case from 2013
 jab modi sarkaar satta main ai, to maamle kii jaanch aage jari rakhane kaa faisla liya, to chrishchiyan mishael or rajeev saxena ko bharat waapas laayaa gaya

 This is a shame on him
 aap isko jitna dabaate hai, ye utana failata he
 Arun Jaitley said that Congress should answer who are RG, FAM and AP? Antony was the defense minister at the time, but there was no mention of AKA in the document
 iske alaava isamen pradhanmantri manmohan singh kaa bhi naam shaamil nahin kiya gaya
 Jaitley also questioned why FAM, AP and RG were mentioned in the case
 He said that now the suspicion in the case is over
 jetali ne aage kaha ki mishael or saxena ne agasta westland maamle main nae dastavej uplabdh karaae hai
 The documents seized by the Swiss police in 2013 match the evidence given by these two accused

 i was 6 yrs old
 My father was fighting for his life and all i thought about was

 com / q15pruyuvu In the US presidential election, Donald Trump's troubles with the Republican Party are increasing
 america ke mashhoor akhbaar neuyork times main do mahilaon ne daawa kiya he ki donald trump ne unhen galat tareeke se chuaa tha
 Let me tell you that some time ago the video of Trump's objectionable statement about women went viral
 74 saal kii jesica leeds naam kii ek mahila ne bataaya ki 1980 main jab vah vimaan se neuyork ja rahi thi to usee vimaan yatra ke dauraan uske saath baithadonald trampane unako galat jagah chune kii koshish kii or skirt main bhi haath daalana chaha tha
 While another woman named Rachel Crooks says that Trump forcibly kissed Lips
 rarshell bataaya ki unke saath jabaran chume jane kii ghatana saal 2005 main trump towers (donald trump kii company kaa mukhyalay) main hui thi
 The Republican Party has denied these allegations against Trump
 party pravaktaa ne kaha he ki yah ek juthi kahani he jo unke ummidavaar kii chhavi dhoomil karne or prachaar abhiyaan ko prabhavit karne ke liye banaai gai he
 Trump's publicity division also described the New York Times report as "concocted"
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki dononmahilaone unke saath hui in ghatnaon kii koi aupchaarik shikaayat nahin kii thi
 But he shared the incident with friends and relatives
 chocolate kaa zikr ho or munh main pani na aae, aisa ho hi nahin saktaa
 From children to elders, they are fond of chocolate
 yahi vajah he ki isse laabh yaa nuksaan kii ore kisi kaa dhyaan nahin jaataa
 There are two types of chocolate
 blike chocolate or white chocolate
 People like both
 poshak aahaar visheshgy da
 Sunit Khanna says, 'antioxidants are found in both types of chocolate, but black chocolate is beneficial in lowering blood pressure
 vahiin, chini kii adhikta hone ke kaaran white chocolate se vajan bad saktaa he
 'he said that white chocolate contains milk and sugar, so if the person who eats it is normal, then it is not harmful
 agar swasth vyakti rojaanaa donon tarah kii chocolate kaa 15 gram se bhi kam maatra main seven karata he to yah nuksaandeh nahin he
 Dr
 Sunit said that if one gets addicted to white chocolate, it can lead to weight gain and increase in the amount of sugar in the blood can cause diabetes patients
 aahaar visheshgy kamini bali kahati hai, ‘chocolate khaane ke baad bacchon ko brush jarur karnaa chahie kyonki agar daanton kii daraaron main yah funs jaae to daant kharaab hone kii ashanka rahati he, lekin chocolate ke kuch phaayde bhi hote hai
 It is difficult to say when chocolate came into existence, but the pages of history show that in 1100 BC food items like chocolate were used
 thode kade rup main chocolate 1847 main bazaar main ai
 It was then the first production by Mars Incarporate
 prayogon kaa silsilaa chalata rahaa
 Then in the US, brands ranging from Nestle, Cadbury to chocolate manufacturers emerged
 har saal saat july ko america main chocolate de manaaya jaataa he
 Chocolate with various flavors are present in the market
 iname dry fruit or fal bhi milaae jate hai
 The magic of chocolate takes it from the small to the elders
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki super star amitabh bachchan se lekar rani mukherjee tak chocolate ke vigyapanon main najar aate hai

 uttar pradesh main beete vidhansabha chunaav main munh kii khaane ke kareeb chah maheene baad soobe main mukhya rashtriya partiyaan sheetanidra se baahar nikaleen or bijepi or congress main jamini str par kuch halchal hui
 Perhaps the parties of these parties have realized that it will be too late if not warned now
 shuruyaat hui 29 agast se, jab bijepi ne koyala aavanton main bhrashtachar ke mudde par pradhanmantri manmohan singh ke istife kii maang karte hue soobe ke sabhi jilon main joardaar pradarshan kiya or pradhanmantri kaa putala foonka
 After this, the process of blowing the effigy started
 congress bhi chup nahin baithi or agle hi din 30 agast ko rajdhani lakhanu main nivartmaan congress adhyaksh reeta bahuguna-joshi kii aguai main kaaryakartaaon ne bijepi ke pradesh daftar ke baahar unke rashtriya adhyaksh nitin gadakari kaa putala foonka
 After this, BJP workers in Kanpur tried to burn the effigy of Union Coal Minister Sriprakash Jaiswal in front of his house
 iskaa virodh karne vaale congress kaaryakartaaon ke saath unki jamkar jhadap hui
 The police tried to calm the matter by lathicharge and more than three dozen people from both sides were injured in this whole incident
 vidhansabha chunaav ke baad yah pehla mauka tha, jab bijepi-congress soobe main sadak par ladati dikhaai deen
 Perhaps they have realized that the party will move into the next Lok Sabha elections and into the trough, turning away from the issues of poor organization and public
 vidhansabha chunaav ke nattejey aane ke baad congress or bijepi ke tatkaaleen pradesh adhyaksh kramash: reeta bahuguna-joshi or suryapratap shahi ne haar kii naitik jimmedaari lete hue istife kii peshkash kar di, lekin nae adhyaksh kaa chunaav or sanghathan ko durust karne kii kavayad main bijepi ne soobe main congress se baaji maar lee
 In the second week of April, BJP not only won the MLA from Meerut, Dr
 lakshmikant vaajapeyi ko pradesh kaa nayaa adhyaksh manonith kar diya, balki party ke navnirvaachit vidhayakon ne kairana se vidhayak hukum singh ko bijepi vidhanmandal dal kaa netaa chun liya
 The BJP also tried to send a message to the leaders who had a hold in the public, that the criteria to move forward in the party would be the work of the public
 vidhansabha chunaav main haar ke jakhm tab bhare, jab june-july main hue sthaneey nikaay chunaav main bijepi ne 12 main se 10 nagar nigamon main apana meyar jitwa liye
 Says senior party leader Rajnath Singh, "the civic election results have proved the bjp's mass base among the public
" '' nikaay chunaav ke nateezon se utsahit party ke liye soobe main sadsyta abhiyaan shuru karne kaa anukool mauka haath laga
 For the first time in the history of the party, a month-long membership campaign, which took place for the first time in the party's history, began on the sidelines of a month (15 July to 15 August)
 is sadsyta abhiyaan ke liye rajnath singh, calraj mishra, vinay katiyaar, or shahi samet sabhi bade netaaon ko nigaraanee kaa jimmaa saunpa gaya
 According to the figures that came to the party after the end of the campaign on 15 August, the number of BJP members in the province more than doubled
 is abhiyaan main 15
 38 lakh new members were created
 isse pehle party ke 14
 There were 3 million members
 purv pradesh mantri or sadsyta abhiyaan ke prabharee devendra singh chouhan kehete hai, ''abhi sadsyta form darj karne kaa kaam chal rahaa he
 The new membership may increase further with the final figures coming
 '' party ke varisht upaadhyaksh calraj mishra kehete hai, ''sapa sarkaar ke muslim tushtikaran or basapa kii purv sarkaar or centre main congress kii sarkaar ke bhrashtaïchaar se aam naagarik ajiz aa chukaa he
 The public is now turning to BJP
 ''sanghathan main nae praan foonkane kii garaj se bijepi ne sanghathanaatmak chunaavon ko hari jhandi dikhaai he
 By 31 October, bjp's state unit will also elect its state president
 12 varshon ke baad yah pehla mauka hoga jab party ke paas nirvaachit pradesh adhyaksh hoga
 After the election of Kalraj Mishra in the year 2000, Vinay Katiyar, Kesharinath Tripathi, Ramapati Ram Tripathi and Shahi were nominated and sat on the chair of the Speaker
 party ke bade netaa bataate hai ki har nae adhyaksh ke manonayan ke baad sanghathanaatmak chunaav kii prakriya shuru hui, lekin party ke bheetar gutbaji ke chalate ise bich main rokna padaa
 The same factionalism also appeared in the assembly and body elections
 aise main is baar sanghathanaatmak chunaavon ko bina kisi vivaad or gutbaji ke sampann karana party ke liye ek kathin chunauti he
 But the party recently gave a clear indication of not tolerating indiscipline by showing 334 activists out of the way simultaneously
 janata se sidhe judye ke kram main party ne ganga abhiyaan kaa sahaara liya he or iskaa jimmaa uma bharti ko saunpa he
 The 'samagra Ganga Abhiyan', running from Ganga Sagar to Gangotri, will be formally launched from Ganga Sagar on 21 September and Uma Bharti's caravan will enter the state on 9 October via Bengal, Jharkhand and Bihar
 14 dinon tak upi main ganga ke kinare chalane vaale is abhiyaan ko haalanki party gaiyr-rajnatik kaarykram bataa rahi he, lekin aresas or vishwa hindu parishad ke netaaon va kaaryakartaaon ne pehle se hi gaanvon main goshtiyaan karke is abhiyaan ke liye maahaul bananaa shuru kar diya
 Due to this campaign, the party also wants to get hold of the backward castes including the Mallah, Nishad, who live on the banks of the Ganges
 is abhiyaan se bijepi netritv or sangh soobe main party ke sanghathan kii pariksha bhi legaa
 Programs like Ganga Yatra, Cow, Ganga and Garib and Jalayatra which took place before the assembly elections, were subjected to non-cooperation of leaders within the party
 bijepi main sanghathanaatmak chunaavon ke baad sargarmi badi he to vidhansabha chunaav ke baad congress ke pradesh karyaalay main pehali baar us vakt gahamagahami dikhi, jab 11 sitambar ko navnirvaachit pradesh adhyaksh nirmal khatri kaarybhaar grahan karne pahunche
 If the six-month bookkeeping of the state Congress is seen after the defeat in the assembly elections, then the only task, the senior leader of the Congress Legislature Party, Pramod Tiwari was removed and the party's MLA from Mathura and Pradeep Mathur with a clean image was posted
 
 is dauraan sthaneey nikaay ke chunaav main bhi party kii kaaphi kirakiri hui he
 In municipal corporations, the party could not win a single mayor, while the party had three mayors before the election
 party ke netaa bataate hai ki vidhansabha chunaav ke baad nae pradesh adhyaksh ke chunaav main deree se party dishaheen ho chuki he
 The impact of this sluggishness is also visible in the membership drive of Youth Congress
 yuva netaaon main utsaah bharne ke liye 16 july se youth congress cameti kaa sadsyta abhiyaan shuru hua, lekin 13 agast ko samaapti tak yah feekaa hi rahaa
 a total of 2 in the membership drive that went on three years ago in 2009
 66 lakh yuvaaon ne youth congress kii sadsyta lee thi, lekin das baar sadsyta navinikaran or nae sadsy banane ke abhiyaan ne purv kii sankhya kaa aadha aankada hi chuaa
 The party has indefinitely postponed the election of the committees of the Youth Congress, in view of the misery of the campaign
 yuva congress ke ek netaa bataate hai ki vidhansabha chunaav or uske baad sthaneey nikaay chunaav main party kii buree haar ke baad youth congress kii sadsyta lene se hichkicha rahe hai
 a young leader who takes charge of the membership drive argues that the party started the membership campaign at a time when the entire state was raining heavily
 saath hi yah vah samay tha jab kisaan apane kheton main kharif kii fasal kii boai kar rahe the
 Due to this, the membership campaign could not hold ground
 uttar pradesh youth congress cameti (madhya jone) ke upaadhyaksh dow
 Umashankar says that the membership drive is on and it will increase significantly compared to last time
 baharhaal, bijepi or congress chaahe jo daawey kar rahi hon lekin yah hakeekat he ki donon partiyon ke jamini kaaryakarta apni upeksha se udasin hai
 The common worker has been lost in the group of big leaders
 agar yahi halaat rahe to agle loksabhaa chunaav main in partiyon kaa damdaar banane kaa sapana dharaa rah jayega
 Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley attacked Congress President Rahul Gandhi and compared him to a failed child

 unhone kaha ki hamen aisi partiyon se desh ko bachaana he jo sansthaanon ko barbaad karne main vishwaas rakhti he

 Arun Jaitley said that democracy in West Bengal is in grave danger
 bhaajapa ke netaa vahaan nahin ja sakate, reliyon ko roka ja rahaa he or rath yatraaon ko anumati nahin di ja rahi he
 The Congress' stance on many issues is contradictory
 vah kerala main camere ke saamne gaay kaa katl karti he or madhyapradesh main gohatya karne waalon ke khilaaf rashtriya suraksha kanoon lagaati he
 They said that they shed crocodile tears for democracy and are making every effort to convert the world's largest democracy into a dynastic system

 gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi ko shuukravaar ko ek sthaneey akhbaar main prakashit bhaajapa ke ishtahaar main bhagwaan krishna ke swaroop main pradarshit kiya gaya
 Bharat Kamdar, president of the Amreli district unit of the BJP, has advertised, which is believed to be a definite controversy

 The advertisement has been published as part of the bjp's Kisan Yatra promotion and was seen today in the Saurashtra edition of a regional newspaper
 gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi vikaspurush kaa chola odh kar desh ke piem pad kaa sapana dekh rahe hai
 But the people of his party are not letting him get out of the Mahabharata period
 rajya ke bade akhbaar main pehle panne par narendra modi ko krishna bana kar rath par chadha dikhaaya gaya he
 Modi's finance minister has criticized such work
 bataaya jaataa he ki modi kaa krishnavatar karaane vaale amarelli bijepi adhyaksh dow bharat kanabar hai
 He has prayed to Modi by giving this big advertisement in the newspaper to make war-like efforts for the good of the farmers
 satta main baithe netaaon kii aisi puja chatukaarita maani jaati he
 Often big leaders also oppose it, but activists do not miss doing it in enthusiasm
 desh ke har duusare ghar kii namak
 This scene is repeated on a dining table adorned with pickles and fruits
 nitu puuchhati he kaisaa bana he, sanju bolta he
 
 
 h xxrep 5 m what nitu bolti he khaanaa or kya
 Sanju replies, salt is low
 
 
 ye outkam sunate hi nitu ke chehre kii chamak kam ho jaati he or sanju, bechaara aparaadhiyon si khamoshi phir odh letaa he
 When this tragic scene happens with others, everyone laughs
 
 
 hansi jiskaa daawa rajkumaar gupta apni film ghanchakkar main karte hai
 From the title itself
 first half main film khub hansaati bhi he
 But in the second half, the salt decreases slightly
 aisa lagata he ki seen kii degachi chadhaakar diarector altaaf raja ke item song main masaroof ho gaye or editor aarti bajaj bhi gum ho gayi
 As a result the film became longer
 public is dauraan apane whatsap or fasebuk ke apadet check kar sakati he
 But the climax once again tests the film
 agar tab tak bahut der na ho gai ho
 Wait for patience
 ghanchakkar jise rajkumaar pehle rapachik romance ke naam se bananaa chaah rahe the kai hisson main rapachik he
 It is made fun by his Chick Chick Sanjay Atre i

 Return comfortably with popcorn and watch the climax

 But before that, they talk about surprise element
 film main amitabh bachchan, dharmendra or utpal dutt ne shandaar guest apiyarence diya he
 When these three happen, the film laughs off berserk
 teenon jate hai ek bank luutane
 And the conversation with the guards, with the police and with each other, reminds me of the same laughter as it was during the Mahabharata staging of the two dudes
 chaunkiye mat film main ye teenon super actor nahin hai
 Actually, Sanju, Pandit and Idris use these masks to escape the grip of CCTV during the bank robbery
 is dauraan dialog inke sunai dete hai or chehre najar aate hai dharam-garam, engri yangamain or hairaan pareshaan utpal da ke
 The imagery of director Rajkumar here arouses hope
 ummid jo aage itani khinchati he ki tuutane main hi apni jaan bachaa paati he
 Sanju and Neetu Love are the couple
 nitu fishan magagenes kii maari he or use dekh pard ke aise bhayanak middle class fishan karti he ki lagata he ki jaise kapadon kii dukaan par cell chal rahi thi, isliye sab rang lad die gaye
 He has decided that now Sanju will not do wrong things
 sanju kaa galat kaam he tijori kholana
 But then comes Pandit's phone and greedy mind decides as usual, that this is just the last time
 raat ke musafir bank lutate hai or paisa sanju ko de diya jaataa he
 Because he is a sensible child with a planet
 phir teen maheene baad jab ye tikdi milti he, to jhol shuru ho jaataa he kyonki sanju kaa daawa he ki accident main uski yaaddaasht chali gai
 Now the trouble is that Sanju does not remember the suitcase in which the money was filled
 iske baad pyaar, dutkaar, dhamkee or manuhaar kaa daur shuru hota he
 Between which Emraan's trademark kissing session, Vidya's retro picture reminiscent of Dirty Picture and Pandit's Ravananuma Shakel's Serious are comic moments in the moment
 clymex main kai wicket girte hai
 Sanju wins the match, but is unable to keep up with the trophy

 The account of the shining moments - The first song of the film, Lazy Lad Saiyan, comes during the casting details
 bachapan kii yaad dilaati lakeeren kuch cartoon numa line banaati hai
 Between the quarrel, pappi jhappi, some mian biwi sequences go on and the film starts
 gane ke bol patniyon ko raahat denge, jo patiyon ko veekend par jhola thamaate hue bhi khiji rahati hai, unke sust ravaiye par
 And would hurt the husbands that the father-in-law found a vacation, made Ramu Kaka in it too
 - jab bhi sanju khaanaa khaataa he, maa kaa phone aata he
 The son ate food, the witch made something or ordered it again from outside today
 ye har us maa kii shaashvat amar chintaa he, jiskaa betaa maa se dur bahu ke saath guzar kar rahaa he
 - There is a brother
 tond se bhare, sabji se laden
 At night, Virar catches the fast local train

 Whenever they come on screen, they laugh
 - ye baat purushon ko kabhi samaj nahin ai ki din ke ant main unki patniyaan bed par baithkar moshcharizer kyon potati hai
 Why Baba Ramdev Numa continues to practice yoga by taking lotion and sometimes on the cheek or sometimes on the foot
 sanju bhi yahi samajhane kii koshish karata hua dikhataa he
 There are many such domestic scenes which remind us of home
 - vidya ke fashneble kapade
 These clothes will be visible to you in the bus, in the metro or on the road, and whenever the mother swears, the sight is tied
 lagata he jaise fishan kii bemail dukaan saji ja rahi ho
 Then why do the stars of the film, who are the fans of Vidya Vidya, read the condeser
 magar yahi sach he yaara
 Vidya is bored
 vahi kahani or darty pikchar kaa mila jula bhav
 Rajkumar Gupta increased his weight to make Punjabi sister-in-law live, but only by weight
 jabaan to aksar aaayaatit hi lagati he
 When all this does not work, a cliché beaten scene is put
 nitu nite dress main, clivej najar aati or pandit idris use ghoorte
 Emraan Hashmi does not seem to be a child with lost memory from anywhere
 aisa lagata he ki unka pet gudgud kar rahaa he, par bivi ko bataa nahin paa rahe or pareshaani main mare ja rahe hai
 Then even when the blows are beaten, the colors of the face do not change
 sirf ek chot kaa nishaan aa jaataa he
 Rajesh Sharma has acted unki cinema main joardaar entry bhi rajkumaar kii pichhali film no van kild jesica ke inspector ke rup main hui thi
 Then he got his name registered in the book Titu Do not fuck the love body Te Chikan Khurana
 yahaan bhi ve daant faad muskaan se mohit karte hai
 Namit Das, who became Idris, has been above the average
 bas yahi samaj nahin aata ki maasoom sa ye cheharaa apni revolver jise vah chota chetan kahata he, kabhi daag bhi saktaa he
 In the same way, when he beats Sanju, it seems incomprehensible
 is kuljama kamjor acting ke alaava second half main betarah khinchati script ne bhi sitare dubaane main yogadan diya he
 Questioning marks arise here on Aarti Bajaj's editing
 nitu par shaq ke liye sanju ke yaar uttam kii entry ho yaa suutakes khojane ke liye kabhi bank to kabhi bageeche main mashkkat karte hero, sab jabaran ke lagate hai
 Now let me also hear that the final verdict had met Rajkumar Gupta a few years ago
 sidhe sachche diarector se
 He had spoken about a big market
 main wo nahin banaaungaa, jisaki public mujhase ummid karne lage
 After making Aamir, he would make a thriller in the same way, then the public would say, o yes this film, it does make it
 isi darshan ne unhen no van kild jesica ke baad kamedi kii taraf modaa
 But this time he could not raise new hopes
 film kamedi or krime suspence kaa bemaja cocktail ban gai he
 Some patches are fine, but not so much that the entire film can be fixed

 The spokesperson said that again and again the SP chief is putting his own government in the dock, the SP chief's warnings become headlines in newspapers, but why Akhilesh Yadav is unable to understand his father and sp's national president, Is beyond comprehension
 unhone kaha jonpur main sipaahi dwaara naaballig balika ke saath dushkarm kii ghatana kanoon-vyavastha durust karne ke akhilesh sarkaar ke daavon ko chunauti detii najar aa rahi he
 Pathak said that the SP chief is talking about putting anti-constitutional acts in jail, what difficulty does the Akhilesh government have in putting them in jail

 Darshan Mehta, a Mumbai-based chartered accountant, says, "recovery of 18 percent service tax from students going to coaching and private tuition is not good in any case

 The question arises that if you have to increase your knowledge, but there is no effective arrangement in government schools and colleges, what will you do? In such a situation, there is only one way and that is to take the help of coaching and tuition

 dijisdm ke dwaara uplabdh karai gai jaankaree se pataa chalata he ki varsh 2013-14 main koching va nijee tution se 1172 karod, varsh 2014-15 main 1304 karod or varsh 2015-16 main 1630 karod kaa rajasav praapt hua
 Bharat Chhaparwal, educationist and former vice-chancellor of Devi Ahilya Bai University, Indore, says that it is the responsibility of governments to provide health and education, but both have put their hands in the field
 nijeekaran ko badhaava diya ja rahaa he, koching va privet tution par seva kar badhaakar sarkaar ne aparoksh rup se nijee sansthaanon ko hi sangrakshan diya he
 He said, "poor students will be in trouble, at first it is not easy for them to arrange fees, double service tax from above
 haa, amir gharon ke bacchon ko isse koi fark nahin padataa
 " chartered accountint mehta kehete hai, "ek taraf vidyalayon or mahavidhyalayon kii shiksha kaa haal kisi se chupa nahin he, majaburi main chaatro ko tution or koching kaa sahaara lenaa hota he
 On the one hand the government is not fulfilling its responsibility, on the other hand it is burdening them
 " Social activist Chandrashekhar Gaur questions how in a country with a democratic system it should be the same as the 'tax' on drinking alcohol at the bar and earning knowledge by sitting at the feet of the Guru
 sarkaar ko to koching va nijee tution par lagane vaale kar ko nunatam rakhana chahie yaa khatm kar dena chahie
 The comments madhya pradesh paryaton vikaas nigam ke adhikari jai mathew kaa kahana he ki pehle nigam ke hotel va baar main 10 pratishat waite or chah pratishat sarvice charge lagata tha, magar centre sarkaar ke amal main laae gaye jiesti ke baad sharaab par 18 pratishat or viyar 14 pratishat wet ho gaya he
 Earlier, liquor was charged at 10 percent VAT and six percent service charge, it was 16 percent, now only 18 percent VAT is being charged
 sawaal uthta he ki agar aapako apana gyaan badhanaa he, magar sarkari vidyalayon or mahavidhyalayon main kargar intjaam nahin he, to aa kya karenge? aise main sirf ek hi rasta he or vah he koching va tution kaa sahaara lenaa
 This task is not as easy as the government is not meeting the requirements on one hand and increasing the tax burden on the students and their families on the other

 In this era of progress, there is a race to create a synergy between civilization and modernity
 is daur main pariwaron kaa dhaancha bhi badal gaya he
 After coming out of the complexities of joint families, the new choice of single family was given to the world by the progress people
 magar tarakkee ke raste par tej raftaar daudte kadamon ko parivaar or uski jimmedaariyaan pairon main bedi kaa ahsaas karaane lagi hai shaayad, tabhi to jimmedaariyon kii zanjeeron ne tej daudte kadamon kii raftaar sust kii, insaan ne isse bhi apana peechha chhudaane kaa intjaam karnaa shuru kar diya or ab ek nae sansar kii taraf kadam badhaata dikhne laga he, jise single fadar yaa single madar kaa naam diya ja rahaa he
 To be honest, it can also be called a challenge regarding the form and destiny of a life, a civilization and a family
 lekin ye chunautiyaan aapako or aapke jivan ko kis tarah pareshaan kar sakati hai or in chunautiyon ke saamne aane ke baad wo koun koun se ahsaas or sanskaar hai, jinaki badaulat vaaki main parivaar, samaaj or sabhyataa ke indradhanushi rang insaan ko apni jindagi main bharne kii ichha phir se panpane lagati he
 The name of Paul's pilgrimage is just this whole sequence
 kishton main kahe gaye kisson kii kahanedenmark kii rahane vaali bhartiya mul kii archana ne paul kii tirthayatra main is vishay ko beshak kishton main kahe gaye ek kisse ke jariye chune kii koshish kii he
 But in this effort, that picture of pain can also be seen
 jiske daayre se jo gujarata he shaayad use hi iskaa ahsaas ho saktaa he
 In this story, Archana weaves two characters whose background is Indian
 kahana galat nahin hoga ki sabhyataa or samaaj us kirdaar or unki prishthbhumi ke sanskaar kaa hi hissaa he or unheen sanskaron ke jariye wo apni jindagi ke kai bade or ahm faislon main un baton ko najar andaaj nahin kar pate, jinhen pashchimi samaaj main shaayad koi tarjeeh nahin mil paati
 The reader gets involved with the story itself, how the character of Paul in this story is so overwhelmed by the ups and downs and after struggling with the mess of life, finally reaches such a destination
 jise paul ne khud pehle se hi tay kiya tha
 The whole story has been woven in such a way that the reader first determines himself as a reader
 lekin jaise jaise kissa aage badhata jaataa he
 Language and its effects can also have such an effect that the reader starts to feel attached to the same story
 lekin iske baad jaise hi pathak khud ko is kahani kaa hissedaar samajhane kaa gumaan paalataa he fouran paul kii yatra puri hone lagati he or pathak khud ko dhire dhire is kahani se baahar nikaal laata he
 The roots of the story will not be so easy, so it does not shock after the end of the story
 lekhak archana panyuli ne denmark main rahete hue is upanyaas kaa nirmaan kiya, wo vaaki adbhud or alokik bhi he
 It can also be seen through this story that the roots do not end so easily even after being hundreds of miles away from the border of India
 duniya main najar aane vaale nae samudaay ke anduruni parivesh ke kai aise sawaal bhi hai, jinke jawaab jaanane kii chatapataahat shaayad lakhon karodon logon ke dilon main rahati he

 lekin apni jadon ko seenchne kaa jajba unamem aaj bhi he
 Surely through this book, Archana Panuli seems to be initiating those people
 jo apni yaadon or apane sukh dukh kii paraton main simatakar apana vajood talash karne kii jaddojahad karte hai

 There is no point in wasting so much time
 aamtaur par bhartiya mahilaon ke liye kaha jaataa he ki ve paramparaagat, aatmanirbhar, pyaar karne vaali, khyaal rakhane vaali hoti hai
 But at the same time some men believe that they are going to run after money, remain very positive about love and will do everything to prove themselves to be modern
 agar aap ek mahila hai to sambhav he ki aapako ye sabhi baaten bilkul bhi pasand nahin aa rahi hon
 You say that the world has changed today and women are more mature and empowered than ever before
 par mahilaon ke prati purushon kii soch kisi mahila kii soch se bilkul alag hoti he
 You will be surprised to know that most Indian men are afraid to date Indian women who are either very modern or very traditional
 yahaan kuch aisi mahilaon kaa zikr he jinhen date karne se bhartiya mard kataraate hai:1
 Men avoid dating women whose thinking is very small
 jo baat-baat par shaq karen or sawaal karen
 2
 baat-baat par jhunjhalane or cheekhney-chillane vaali mahilaon se purush dur hi rahanaa pasand karte hai
 3
 aisi mahilaayein jinke liye paisa hi sabakuch hota he, unase bhi purush duuri hi banaakar rakhana pasand karte hai
 4
 mardon ko aisi mahilaayein bhi pasand nahin aati hanjo bahut adhik parampara ko maanane vaali hon
 5
 zyaadaatar bhartiya mardon ko aisi mahilaayein pasand nahin aati hai jo nariwadi hoti hai
 6
 haalanki adhiktar mard khud bhi plabvoy hi hote hai lekin unhen pasand nahin aata he ki jise wo date kar rahe hai wo bhi ek plagirl ho
 7
 har roj party main jane vaali mahilaon se bhi purush parhez hi karte hai
 8
 bahut adhik modern ladki jo duniya ko dikhaane ke liye pahenti ho, jise sharaab kii lat ho or jo dikhaava pasand ho, unase bhi bhartiya mard duuri banaakar rakhte hai

 usne sabhi se bhul-chook maafee kii baat bhi kahi
 According to the information, there are a total of 15 (one woman, who is kept in the female ward) prisoners in the hanging yard, of which all except Yakub were sent to another yard
 yaaqub jis cell main tha, usamen koi kadi (chen) nahin lagi thi
 The comments haalanki baahar jawan paharaa de rahe the, taaki wo khudakushi naa kar paae
 Yakub met his fellow inmates before the execution and even met the jail staff and apologized for the mistake
 faansee se pehle yaqub ne doctoron ko khud ko check nahin karne diya
 He said that i am fit, no need to check
 yaqub ne subah se quran padhi
 a day before he was hanged, Yakub met his brother Suleiman and then he had tears
 jaankaree ke anusaar, faansee yard main kul 15 (ek mahila he, jise mahila ward main rakhaa gaya) kaidi hai, jisamen se yaaqub ko chhod baaki sabhi ko duusare yard bhej diya gaya tha
 The cell in which Yakub was in had no chain

 Yakub did not let the doctors check themselves before hanging
 usne kaha ki main feet hum, check karne kii jarurat nahin

 The chaotic health system in Bihar is under question
 ab or bhi gambhir or chaunkaane vaale tathy saamne aa rahe hai
 Bihar's decaying health care is absolutely exposed amidst the deaths of children in Muzaffarpur
 ab nae tathy bataa rahe hai ki pichley kuch varshon main halaat bigade hi hai
 According to Bihar Economic Survey 2018-19, there were an average of 109 health centers per 10 lakh people in Bihar in 2012, which decreased to 100 in 2016 and then after two years further decreased to 99 in 2018
 yani 7 saal main bihar main 10 lakh logon par ausat health centaron kii sankhya 10 kam ho gai
 BJP MP Sushil Singh says that the number of health centers should have been increased in proportion to the increase in population in the state
 ye aise vakt par hua jab in varshon main bihar kii jansankhya main acchhee badhottaree register kii gai
 This is also the situation of Primary Health Centers, whose number has increased almost to the same extent
 2012-2018 ke bich praathmik swasthya centre kii sankhya main koi badhottaree nahin hui, wo 533 par bane rahe
 In these seven years, the number of health sub-centers increased from 9696 to 9949, ie just 2
 54% kii badhottaree
 Additional primary health centers were 1330 to 1379
 
 
 yani sirf 3
 6% increase
 agar sabhi swasthya centre ko dekhen to 2012-2018 ke bich inaki sankhya 11,559 se 11,891 tak pahunchi
 That means only 2 in these years in number
 6% kaa izapha hua
 Congress leader Anand Sharma says, "this matter comes under the state government
 rajya sarkaar ko isaki javabdehi leni hogi
 This is the situation when the Bihar government's health budget has increased by 83% in four years
 2014-15 main swasthya par bihar sarkaar kaa kul kharch 3604 karod tha jo 2017-18 main ye bajet badhkar 6535 karod rupee ho gaya
 Many big questions are arising from the Bihar Economic Survey
 sabase ahm sawaal ye he ki jab pichley kul saal main swasthya sector par kharch badhaayaa gaya to phir har das lakh kii aabaadi par uplabdh health centaron kii ausat sankhya pichley 7 saal main kyon ghat gai

 The website 'my Nation' has used a video of Malayalam news channel Asianet News on 25 March 2019
 iske saath likhaa gaya, “aadhikarik elaan se pehle hi youth congress ke kaaryakarta rahul kii ummidavaari kaa jashn manaate hue

 mathrubhumi newjane ye khabar 31 march ko dikhaai jisamen kaha gaya ki “vynad se rahul kii ummidavaari se udief main jabardast utsaah he
 At the end of this video, the reporter makes his point, behind which people have also taken photographs and green flags of Rahul Gandhi
 kerala main udief 6 partiyon kaa gathbandhan he jo milakar chunaav lard rahe hai
 This includes the Muslim League along with the Congress
 gathbandhan kaa sahyogi hone ke naate rahul gandhi kii ummidavaari kaa muslim lig ne swaagat kiya
 This is confirmed in many media reports
 indian union muslim lig (IUML) party kaa jhanda haraa he or uske baayen kone par chand sitare bane hue hai
 At the same time, the flag of Pakistan also has green color and the moon stars, but the Muslim League and Pakistani flag can be easily distinguished
 isliye ye saaf taur par kaha ja saktaa he ki vynad main rahul gandhi ke samarthan main prachaar ke dauraan pakistani jhande nahin laharaae gaye

 During the discussion on the no confidence motion in the Lok Sabha on Friday, the Modi government was targeted by Congress President Rahul Gandhi, but after the speech, Rahul's embrace of Prime Minister Modi and then winking has become the biggest news
 ab bijepi is mudde par frontroot par khel rahi he, netaa se lekar mantri tak har koi rahul par hamalavar he
 On Monday, when Rahal raised the issue of Alwar lynching, the entire BJP came to attack him
 kendriya mantri piyush goyal ne rahul ko nafrat kaa saudagar bataa daalaa
 On Monday, the BJP also tweeted a uniform about Rahul
 jisamen unhone gale laganaa or aankh maarane ke mudde par rahul ko gheraa
 It was said by the BJP that the drama of 70 years of love, stop this lie's gate

 Union Minister Smriti Irani, who contested against Rahul from Amethi, wrote that Rahul Gandhi's family sparked hatred in the country through 1984, Bhagalpur and many other riots
 ye sharmnaak he ki congress ab is tarah kii nitiyaan apana rahi he
 Smriti wrote that there is no such issue in the country for which they are not trying to take advantage of electoral gains
 Rahul Gandhi’s family presided over the worst form of hate in 1984, Bhagalpur & Nellie & many other instances
 It is shameful that he is doing the same through VULTURE POLITICS
 Not a single instance goes by where he doesn't attempt to rupture social bonds for electoral gains

 He wrote that whenever there is an accident, stop jumping on it
 rajya sarkaar ne is mudde par pehle hi sakht karrwai kii he
 You are dividing society for your electoral gains and then you shed crocodile tears
 goyal ne rahul gandhi ko nafrat kaa vyapaaree bataaya
 Stop jumping with joy every time a crime happens, Mr Rahul Gandhi
 The state has already assured strict & prompt action
 You divide the society in every manner possible for electoral gains & then shed crocodile tears
 Enough is Enough
 You are a MERCHANT OF HATE

 co / 4thsynl3nx — Piyush Goyal (@piyushgoyal) July 23, 2018 Let us tell you that this issue has been hot since when Rahul Gandhi hugged Prime Minister Modi on his seat
 pehle loksabhaa adhyaksh sumitra mahajan ne ise galat bataaya, lekin baad main congress ne hi iskaa raajnneetik phayda uthaanaa shuru kar diya
 In Mumbai, the Congress put up posters of the photo hugging modi-rahul and wrote on it that he will win with love, not hate
 sapa or congress ke bich chunaav purv gathbandhan ho jane ke baad ab upi main ladaai ke trikoniya hone kii ummid he
 Till now the real battle was SP, BSP, BJP and Congress
 ab nae siyaasi sameekaran main voter ke saamne mukhya rup se teen vikalp honge sapa congress gathbandhan, bispi or bijepi
 Kaviraj, a professor of political science at Lucknow University, also confirms this
 uttar pradesh kii raajnneeti main unhone vistrut rup se apane vichaar saajha kiye
 
 
 It was very important for the Samajwadi Party and the Congress to have a pre-election alliance
 aisa nahin he ki 27 saal se satta se baahar congress ke liye dobaaraa khadaa hone ke liye kisi sahare kii jarurat thi balki is baar bahumat ke aankade ko paar karne ke liye sapa ko bhi thos aadhaar kii jarurat thi
 sp's loss in family quarrel, in fact, this time SP needed an alliance because after the family quarrel, it started becoming a weak SP image among the people of the state
 sapa kaa matadaata chaahe shahari ho yaa gramin permanent voter hi he
 Some voters are floating
 floating voter media main aa rahi khabaron ke aadhaar par apana mat tay karte hai
 SP must have expected the floating voter to shift elsewhere due to family battles
 jiske chalate akhilesh ko muslim voton ke bhi bispi main shift hone kii sambhaavnaaen zyada hoti dikhne lagi hongi
 Muslim votes play a decisive role in the state
 19 fisadi yah vot sapa kaa kor vot bank he
 For this reason, the SP has tried to bring the message to the Muslims by bringing the Congress together that a national party is with us, together we can directly compete with the BJP
 gathbandhan se hoga congress kaa zyada phaaydasapa-congress gathbandhan se sapa ko kam or congress ko zyada phayda hoga
 Muslim is a permanent voter of SP
 gathbandhan kii sthiti main tradishnal voter hi vot transfar karte hai
 SP has these as Yadav and Muslim but Congress does not have any traditional voter at the time
 aise main sapa ko apni 298 siton par bahut phayda to nahin hoga haalanki congress ko uski siton par jarur phayda pahonchega
 The Congress will not have been in a strong position in the seats where SP will contest
 kuch siton par jarur maton kaa antar kam karne main yah gathbandhan kargar sabit hoga
 Will there not be a Muslim vote shift? After 1991, usually the Muslim vote goes to the party that defeats the BJP
 ab pehle jaisi sthiti nahin hogi
 Now this alliance will remain the first priority of Muslim voters
 haalanki yah bhi sambhaavna he ki jahaan gathbandhan ummidavaar kamjor hoga vahaan bispi ko muslim vot mil sakate hai
 That is, where the BSP must be winning, it will be with the BSP and where the alliance will be winning, with the alliance there
 professor ke mutabik congress kii 105 siton main kuch siten aisi hone kii sambhaavna zyada he jinamein congress ke pratyaashee aise na hon jo bijepi yaa bispi se takkar le saken
 In those seats, the Muslim vote can break from the coalition
 is tarah kii voting ko tectical voting kehete hai
 The same Congress leader will get the SP vote which will be seen winning
 varanaa, bijepi or bispi ke bich sidhaa muqabla hota najar aayega
 Effect of bsp's Muslim Card: Muslim community of UP find themselves comfortable in SP
 lekin agar gathbandhan bijepi ke saamne kamjor padataa najar aayaa to use bispi ke saath janaa majaburi hogi
 BSP supremo Mayawati also understands this mood very well
 isiilie is baar unhone 97 muslim chehron ko maidan main utaara he
 If this math of Mayawati worked and 19 percent of Muslims came together with 23 percent Dalit, then the BSP could return to power
 bijepi ko kya phayda hogis gathbandhan se bijepi ko aparoksh rup se phayda ho saktaa he
 There will be confusion among Muslims as to who is winning where, this will result in division of their votes which will be beneficial for BJP
 apane hi garh main kamjor ho chuki he areldipashchimi uttar pradesh main areldi kaa sabase majboot janaadhar tha
 But if we look at the 2012 data, only weak RLD is seen
 pichley vidhansabha chunaavon main pashchimi uttar pradesh main sapa ko 24, bispi ko 23, bijepi ko 13, areldi ko 9 or congress ko 5 siten mili thim
 The Math seat of Mathura came to bjp's account during the by-election
 vahiin mathura kii govardhan seat se areldi vidhayak ab bijepi main shaamil ho chuke hai
 In the same way, RLD mlas from Aligarh's Barauli Assembly have also joined BJP
 areldi kaa parformens lagaataar chunaav-dar-chunaav girtaa rahaa he
 His vote percentage 2 in 2012
 33% tha jabak 2007 main 3
 70%
 aise main unke mat kaa gathbandhan par asar padane kii sambhaavna bahut hi kam he

 Mayawati said at the election meetings held in Gonda and Bahraich that the Congress is following the British "divide and rule" policy by announcing the separation of nine percent quota (minority) in the 27 percent reservation quota prescribed for backward classes
 , But BSP will not accept reservation within reservation

 Accusing the Uttar Pradesh residents of the Congress-ruled states of being half-hearted, he said that due to the wrong policies of the Congress government at the Center, unemployment has increased and the people of the country are plagued by inflation

 He also raised the Congress and BJP in the dock on the issue of black money of Indians deposited in foreign banks and said that Congress has so much stain on it that it did not take any initiative in this direction while remaining in power at the Center for almost seven years
 BJP too did not take any concrete step in this direction

 When the Akhilesh government completed 100 days of its government on June 22, the strong minister of the same government, Shivpal Singh Yadav, raised the figure of suspending corrupt officials working in his department to 100
 silsilaa iske baad bhi jari he
 The number of suspended officials of the Public Works Department (PWD), Irrigation and Cooperation Department has reached 125 so far
 mayawati sarkaar ke beete paanch saal ke dauraan jahaan ek ore mulaayam singh yadav or akhilesh yadav party sanghathan ko majboot kar rahe the to duusari ore mulaayam ke chote bhai shivpal bahujan samaaj party (bispi) sarkaar main ho rahe bhrashtachar par paini nigaah rakh rahe the
 It was Shivpal who took up the task of collecting documents related to corruption and exposing them to the media
 aise main sarkaar banate hi tay ho gaya ki pichhali sarkaar main hui gadabadiyon ke khilaaf shivpal kaaphi mukhar honge
 He made his intentions clear with starting work as Public Works and Irrigation Minister from 19 March
 apane pehle hi aadesh main unhone bispi sarkaar ke dauraan lakhanu or noida main bane parkon or smarakon main lagaai gai murtiyon ko baar-baar todane ke bare main afasaron se report talab kar bhrashtachar ke khilaaf muhim kaa aagaaj kar diya
 On April 13, a day before Ambedkar Jayanti, Shivpal removed 50 tainted engineers, including general manager, project manager, manager associated with all of Mayawati's dream projects, including Ambedkar Park in Lucknow and attached them to the headquarters
 agle hi din shivpal ne lakhanu main lok nirmaan vibhaag dwaara banaai gai sadakon kaa nirikshan kiya or lakhanu-kanpur tathaa hardoi-sitapur road nirmaan main gadabadi ke aaropee 15 ejiniyaron ko ek saath nilambit kar diya
 This was the first time after the formation of Samajwadi Party (SP) government that such a large number of officers were suspended simultaneously
 phir to nilamban kaa silsilaa chal padaa
 Shivpal says, "officers in the BSP government had become so powerful that they had no control over them
 inhone jahaan chaha, vahaan bhrashtachar kiya, jameen hi nahin, nadi ko bhi nahin bakhsha
 "farm houses were illegally built in the catchment area of river Yamuna near Noida
 shivpal kehete hai, ''bispi sarkaar ke dauraan ho rahi gadabadiyon par sapa kii najar thi or har jile se kaaryakarta bhrashtachar kii shikaayat kar rahe the
 Now all these are being investigated
 '' (dekhen: baatcheet)
 An irrigation department official compares the functioning of Shivpal Singh with BSP supremo Mayawati
 jis tarah mayawati jilon kaa auchak nirikshan kar maukey par hi adhikariyon ko nilambit karti thim, usee tarah shivpal ne bhi ab tak ek darjan se adhik pariyojnaon kaa auchak nirikshan kar 50 se adhik adhikariyon ko maukey par hi nilambit kiya he
 Take, for example, the Bansagar project in Allahabad and Mirzapur
 10 may ko sinchai mantri achaanak 1,800 karod ru
 Ki reached to inspect this project
 adhikariyon se pariyojna se jude dastavej mangaaye to pataa chalaa ki varsh 2007 se 2012 ke bich pariyojna par 1,286 karod ru
 There were expenses, but no work was done
 shivpal ne aniyamitata ke aarope main nau ejiniyaron ko nilambit kar diya or chah kii pension rokane kaa aadesh de diya
 Senior SP leader and state spokesperson Rajendra Chaudhary says, "shivpal Singh Yadav is a fearless leader
 ve kade-se-kade faisle lene main der nahin karte
 Shivpal has the full support of Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav
 vyastata ke kaaran akhilesh yadav ne sahakaarita vibhaag shivpal singh ko de diya or unhone yah pad sambhalate hi gadabadiyon kii jaanch ke aadesh de die
 So far 45 officers have been suspended on charges of irregularities in this department, not taking charge of wheat procurement centers and not taking interest in wheat procurement
 bhale hi sahakaarita, peedblyoody or sinchai vibhaag ke sava sau afasaron ko suspend kiya ja chukaa ho, lekin itane hi daagi adhikariyon par jaanch kii talwaar ab bhi lataki hui he
 Opponent parties are seeing this action of Shivpal from another perspective
 bispi ke purv pradesh adhyaksh or vipaksh ke netaa swami prasad maury kehete hai ki shivpal afasaron main nilamban kaa ek hauva khadaa kar rahe hai taaki baad main vasuuli kii ja sake
 Maurya says, "if an officer is really guilty, then his investigation and then action should be taken
 bina jaanch ke nilambit karnaa sawaal khadey karata he
 "shivpal Singh's private residence is on Vikramaditya Marg in Lucknow and he has been allotted as Minister, Government Bungalow 8, Kalidas Marg
 in dinon shivpal kii dincharya kii shuruyaat sarkari awaas se hoti he
 At 9 am, they reach government accommodation from their private residence
 baahar mulakatiyon kii bheed he
 Irrespective of the crowd, Shivpal does not disappoint those coming from other districts
 swayan hi fariyaadiyon ke prarthanapatr lete he or tatkaal unki samasyaon kaa nibatara kar dete hai
 Senior SP leader Bhagwati Singh praises Shivpal's organizational ability
 ve kehete hai, ''shivpal singh yadav kii sabase khaas baat yah he ve kaaryakartaaon main bhedbhaav nahin karte
 Be it ordinary workers or big leaders, they give utmost importance to everyone's talk
 shivpal kaa milansaar swabhaav unhen lokapriy banaata he
 "sp's young Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav may have emerged as a technical choice leader today, but the foundation was laid by Shivpal Singh within the party
" varsh 2006 main jab sabhi partiyaan phone or fax ke jariye akhabaaron yaa anya jagahon se sampark saadhaa karti thim us samay bataur kaaryakari adhyaksh shivpal ne sapa ke rajya mukhyalay ke media centre ko internet, computer se las kiya
 Ashish Yadav, in-charge of the media center, says, "the sp's media center was the first center among all political parties, which first started using the modern technology of communication
 ''kya sapa sarkaar main mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav or sansadeey kaarymantri ajam khan ko mil rahe mahatv ke aage shivpal kii shakhsiyat kho-si gai he? sapa ke varisht netaa or basic shiksha vibhaag ke cabinet mantri ram govind choudhary kehete hai, ''shivpal singh sapa ke sardaar patel hai
 Like Patel, Shivpal is also known for his determination and decision-making ability
 sapa sarkaar or party main unki yahi shakhsiyat unhen ek alag pahchaan detii he
