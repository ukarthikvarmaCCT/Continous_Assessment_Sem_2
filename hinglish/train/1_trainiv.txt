 bollywood badal rahaa he
 Our thinking is very progressive
 agar mujhe koi kirdaar pasand he or iske liye kuch karne kii jarurat he or yah mujhe sahi lagata he to main ise karuungi

 aids yaa echivi se grast logon ke liye jivan beemaa jald hi hakeekat kaa rup lene ja rahi he
 In fact, the authority regulating insurance has sought the suggestions of insurance companies by issuing draft guidelines in this regard
 insurance regulatory and deveopment athurity ( IRDA) ne yah draft isi maheene jari kiya he, jisamen aids yaa echivi ke marijon ke liye policy kaa zikr he

 However some insurance companies are still providing insurance for such patients
 star health and ellid insurance jaisi companiyaan ye suvidhaayen de rahi hai
 Significantly, insurance regulator 'IRDA' recently asked insurance companies not to dismiss any claims of people living with HIV
 irada ne ek circular jari kar kaha ki beemaa anubandh shuru hone kii date par jin logon kaa echivi negative tha or polisy kii avadhi ke dauraan vah echivi grast ho jaataa he, to is aadhaar par beemaa companiyaan daawey ko khaarij nahin karengi
 According to IRDA, insurance companies can offer products designed for such people with serious illness in mind

 Rama Rao began his address to an election meeting in Warangal with a slogan
 shlogan tha, ''shaar plus car aante delilo sarkaar

 kehane kaa matlab tha ki tiares (telugana rashtri samiti) ko jitaaoge ke to dilli ke darbar main bada hissaa milane kaa sukh paaoge
 In fact, the TRS government of the state is appealing to voters to make this victory big in order to play an important role in making the country's PM during election campaign these days
 janata se vaada kiya ja rahaa he ki agar rajya kii 17 loksabhaa siton main se 16 siten kesiar ko milti hai to telugana kii janata kii aawaaj dilli ko sunani hi padegi

 First, they did not want the Lok Sabha elections to be held in their state
 kyonki agar aisa hota to rajya ke nahin balki rashtriya str ke mudde haaavee hote
 Recently, he had seen the electoral mode of the current Prime Minister, so he knew that it is not possible to guess what leaves the bjp-led Central Government will open during the elections
 centre ke prachaar kaa phayda unke rajya main bhaajapa ko mil saktaa tha
 The growing proximity of TDP and Congress was also his target
 ashanka thi ki ye donon dal ek saath aa gaye to mushkil bad jaaegi
 Doubt did not prove to be wrong either
 119 vidhansabha siton vaale telugana main tidipi ke liye congress ne 14 siten chodi bheen
 Actually, the way the 'grand Alliance' showed solidarity during the assembly elections held in five states last year, it seemed that there would be solidarity against the BJP or their allies in the states too
 haalanki loksabhaa chunaav aate-aate rajyon ke kshatrap ek duusare khilaaf vaise hi khadey hai jaise hameshaa khadey rahete hai

 Apart from the premature dissolution of the state assembly, the way KCR not only resigned from the post of Deputy Chairman of the Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly within a year, but also broke ties with the TDP, was the far-reaching thinking of KCR

 The court termed the response of the police in the case as 'completely shocking' and said that the force does not even know whether the cameras installed by it are working or not yet

 Trump said that Indian students studying in all the institutes of America cannot be excluded
 unhone kaha ki aise medhaavi chaatro kii america ko jarurat he
 In response to a question about legal immigration during an interview, Trump said that students from all countries come to study in American educational institutions
 unamem bhartiya bhi hai
 He said whether we like it or not, he comes here and pays the fees, studies well and also comes first in institutions like our Harvard
 america ko aise hi chaatro kii zarurat bhi he
 According to the goaltram with Indian students, some of them start jobs here after taking education in America and some go to India to open a company and give employment to people
 ye unki badi baat he
 Speaking about some aspects of the H-1B visa, Trump said that it is not right for students who stay here to study and to be expelled as soon as they are educated
 kyonki unke paas behtareen idiaj hote hai

 On the occasion of State Foundation Day, a program called Raibar was organized in Dehradun, Uttarakhand, which was launched by Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat
 rabar gadhwali bhashaa kaa shabd he jiskaa matlab hota he pukarana yaa colling
 The program was attended by Bhaskar Khulbe, Secretary to the Prime Minister, Ashwani Lohani, Chairman, Railway Board
 costguard ke mahanideshak rajendra singh, rajya palaayan ayog ke upaadhyaksh eses negi ke saath hi namchin hastiyon ne kaarykram main hajiri lagaai
 The purpose of the Rabar program is to sit with the people of Uttarakhand origin and reflect on the progress and future of the state

 But due to some unavoidable reasons, he could not attend the ceremony, whatever the reason may have been, but his absence was certainly disappointing, although the arrival of the Chief of Army Staff General Bipin Rawat was definitely a bit comforting
 naaraaz bhi rahe janata ke pratinidhiuttarakhand sarkaar ke is kaarykram main chintan to mukhya rup se is baat par hua ki pradesh kii sabase gambhir samasya 'palaayan' par kaise roak lage
 But surprisingly, the areas where the problem of migration has taken the most serious form, only the elected mlas from those areas were not invited to this seminar, which is a question mark on the seriousness of the seminar
 'janata ke chune hue pratinidhiyon se bhadda majaak'rudraprayag jile ke kedarnath vidhansabha seat se vidhayak manoj ravat ne phone ke madhyam se jaankaree di ki na hi is kaarykram kii unako or unke jaise kai vidhayakon ko soochna mili or na hi kaarykram main pahunchane kaa koi nimantran hi mila
 If the MLA is to be believed, then it is a ridiculous joke that the people whom they choose and send to the assembly to represent themselves, kept them away from a program which is directly connected with the public
 'pahaad chhodkar chalaa gaya he mahanubhaavon kaa parivaar'kedarnath vidhayak manoj ravat ne safataur par kaha ki band kamaron main baithkar palaayan rokane kii baat karne vaale ek bhi mahanubhav bataaen ki wo or unke parivaar kahan rahete hai? pahaad ko chhodkar chale gaye ye mahanubhav pahaad ke bare main shaayad ab thik se jaanate bhi nahi hai

 Metropolitan Magistrate (MM) Sunil Kumar Sharma told lawyer Rahul Mehra appearing on behalf of Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia, Prashant Bhushan and Shazia Ilmi that they should ensure that the accused would be present on the next date of hearing
 adaalat ne maamle kii taarikh 24 may nirdhaarit karte hue kaha, ‘sunishchit kiijie ki (sunwaayee) agali taarikh ko sabhi upasthit honge anyathaa majaboor hokar karrwai kerani hogi
 The court also imposed a fine of Rs 2500-2500 on Sisodia, Bhushan and Ilmi, while all of them accepted their request for exemption from personal appearance today
 adaalat ne isse pehle 15 march ko pesh hue bhushan or ilmi ko is aashwaasan ke saath jane diya tha ki ve sunwaayee kii ek-ek or har taarikh ko upasthit rahenge
 On July 24 last year, the court summoned Kejriwal, Sisodia, Bhushan and Ilmi on a criminal defamation complaint filed on behalf of Amit

 Mathur said that the accused got about five weeks from the last date of hearing on March 15 but so far they could not appear in the court
 unhone kaha, ‘ve maamla nahin chalane de rahe hai
 However, the court said the plea for exempting Kejriwal can be considered as he is contesting the Lok Sabha elections himself

 No convincing evidence has been found to prove the 1 lakh 76 thousand scam in 2G spectrum allocation
 special sibiai court ke faisle ke baad yah baat hazam nahin ho paa rahi he ki jis ghotaale ko bharat ke itihaas kaa sabase bada ghotaalaa bataaya gaya, use sabit karne ke liye aakhir sibiai saat saal main saboot kyon nahin pesh kar pai
 In 2010, the CAG report was about 1 lakh 76 thousand crores scam
 jiske aadhaar par media ke tamaam manchon par jamkar bahes hui or yah ghotaalaa jan jan tak pahunchaa
 Today, when all its accused are dropped and no evidence is found, this decision has come as a shock to all of us
 is maamle ke mukhya aaropee e raja ne diemke pramukh em karunanidhi ko patr likhaa he
 He has said that 'who will punish him who stained your 80 years of political life
 main 2ji faisle ko aapke charnon main shraddha ke saath arpit karata hum
 You kept me safe in the snow so that i would not melt in this battle
 main aapke shabdon kaa intazaar kar rahaa hum

 It is a matter of shame that even the UPA government did not know that a plot to demolish it was hatched
 2012 tak 60 karod logon tak mobile conection pahunchaana tha, hamane 2009 main hi 59 karod logon tak conection pahunchaa diya
 The Spectral Cartel was disbanded to pave the way for the whatsapp, Twitter and Facebook revolution
 press or media ne research nahin kiya or spectrum ke saamaajik sandarbhon ko nahin dekha
 ' raja kii kitaab kaa intazaar rahegaa
 After seven years of investigation, the acquittal of everyone is a shock
 kya vaaki jaisaa raja kah rahe hai wo sahi hoga, kya koi aisa plot rachaa gaya jiske anusaar sieji ne kaam kiya, sieji kii report ko lekar phir media ne kaam kiya
 The media was also recognized by the CAG report
 vinod raay ne sieji kii report main 1 lakh 76 hazaar karod ke aankade hi nahin die the, uske alaava bhi kai aankade die the
 The CAG counted the loss in four ways
 67,364, 69,626, 57,666 or chauthaa aankalan tha 1 lakh 76 hazaar 645 karod kaa
 On 21 December, Business Today wrote that the CAG had never given a figure of 1 lakh 76 crore in its report
 sieji ne kaha tha ki yah sahi he ki 2ji spectrum ke bantwaare main sarkari khajaane ko nuksaan pahunchaa magar kitna nuksaan pahunchaa, is par bahes ho sakati he
 In April 2011, when the CBI filed a charge sheet against Raja, it was said that the government exchequer had suffered a loss of Rs 30,984 crore
 first post main us samay sieji rahe vinod raay kaa ek intervyuu chapa he
 His book came at that time
 unase 1 lakh 76 hazaar karod kii ginati ke bare main poocha gaya ki aap is par kaise pahunche to unka jawaab tha ki 'hamaara tark saral he, 2008 main niti thi pehle aao pehle paao
 You got x amount, in 2010 you changed the policy and brought you auction and you got y amount
 or y main se x ghataane par hota he 1
 76 lakh crore
 hamane bas itnaa kiya or kuch nahin, hamane teen or aankade bhi die the lekin public imegination ne 1
 76 lakh crores, yes it was a big amount
 ' Vinod Rai believes that it was a large amount
 kya yah chaalaaki thi
 Even then it was a huge amount, so how to accept that there is no one to blame
 kya hisaab lagane vaale ne khyaali pilav banaaya yaa jaanch karne vaale ne sara pilav kha liya
 If those who are insisting that there was a scam then why are they not emphasizing how the accused got acquitted
 kyon unke khilaaf saboot nahin pesh kiye ja sake
 Vinod Rai has not been able to speak yet 
 us dauraan media kii bhoomika ko lekar bhi bahes ho rahi he
 Let me remind you that after the revelations of the Radia tapes, the role of media also came in the wrap of 2G

 After seven years of investigation, the acquittal of everyone is a shock
 kya vaaki jaisaa raja kah rahe hai wo sahi hoga, kya koi aisa plot rachaa gaya jiske anusaar sieji ne kaam kiya, sieji kii report ko lekar phir media ne kaam kiya
 The media was also recognized by the CAG report
 vinod raay ne sieji kii report main 1 lakh 76 hazaar karod ke aankade hi nahin die the, uske alaava bhi kai aankade die the
 The CAG counted the loss in four ways
 67,364, 69,626, 57,666 or chauthaa aankalan tha 1 lakh 76 hazaar 645 karod kaa
 On 21 December, Business Today wrote that the CAG had never given a figure of 1 lakh 76 crore in its report
 sieji ne kaha tha ki yah sahi he ki 2ji spectrum ke bantwaare main sarkari khajaane ko nuksaan pahunchaa magar kitna nuksaan pahunchaa, is par bahes ho sakati he
 In April 2011, when the CBI filed a charge sheet against Raja, it was said that the government exchequer had suffered a loss of Rs 30,984 crore
 first post main us samay sieji rahe vinod raay kaa ek intervyuu chapa he
 His book came at that time
 unase 1 lakh 76 hazaar karod kii ginati ke bare main poocha gaya ki aap is par kaise pahunche to unka jawaab tha ki 'hamaara tark saral he, 2008 main niti thi pehle aao pehle paao
 You got x amount, in 2010 you changed the policy and brought you auction and you got y amount
 or y main se x ghataane par hota he 1
 76 lakh crore
 hamane bas itnaa kiya or kuch nahin, hamane teen or aankade bhi die the lekin public imegination ne 1
 76 lakh crores, yes it was a big amount
 ' Vinod Rai believes that it was a large amount
 kya yah chaalaaki thi
 Even then it was a huge amount, so how to accept that there is no one to blame
 kya hisaab lagane vaale ne khyaali pilav banaaya yaa jaanch karne vaale ne sara pilav kha liya
 If those who are insisting that there was a scam then why are they not emphasizing how the accused got acquitted
 kyon unke khilaaf saboot nahin pesh kiye ja sake
 Vinod Rai is yet to speak
 us dauraan media kii bhoomika ko lekar bhi bahes ho rahi he
 Let me remind you that after the revelations of the Radia tapes, the role of media also came in the wrap of 2G
 aaj sab bari ho kar khadey hai

 lalu yadav kaa kahana he ki amit shah ke maamle main special court ke faisle ko abhi tak chunauti nahin di gai he
 CBI is not acting in a fair manner
 21 disambar ko bijness today ne likhaa he ki sieji ne apni report main kabhi bhi 1 lakh 76 karod kaa aankada nahin diya tha
 The CAG had said that it is true that the sharing of 2G spectrum has caused damage to the exchequer but how much damage can be done, there can be a debate
 april 2011 main sibiai ne jab raja ke khilaaf aarope patr daayar kiya tab kaha tha ki sarkari khajaane ko 30,984 karod kaa nuksaan hua he
 In the first post, an interview of Vinod Rai, who was then CAG, has been printed
 us vakt unki kitaab ai thi
 He was asked about the count of 1 lakh 76 thousand crores, how did you reach it, then his answer was that 'our logic is simple, in 2008 the policy was first come first serve
 aap ko mila x raashi, 2010 main aapane hi niti badal kar nilaamee le aae or aapako mili y raashi
 And by subtracting x from Y, 1 happens
 76 lakh karod
 All we did was nothing else, we had given three more figures but Public Imagination 1
 76 lakh karod pakadaa, haa yah badi rakam thi
 ' vinod raay maanate hai ki yah badi rakam thi
 Was it cleverness phir bhi yah badi rakam thi to is baat ko kaise sweekaar kar liya jaae ki koi doshi hi na ho
 Did the calculator make a famous casserole or did the investigator eat the whole casserole? agar jo log is par jor de rahe hai ki ghotaalaa hua tha to is par kyon nahin jor de rahe hai ki aaropee bari kaise ho gaye
 Why evidence could not be presented against him
 vinod raay abhi tak nahin bol paae hai
 During that time the role of media is also being debated
 aapako yaad dilaa den ki radia tepe ke khulaase ke baad media kii bhoomika bhi 2ji ke lapete main aa gai thi
 Today all are standing acquitted
 is ghotaale ko cover karne main media kii sakriyata ne bharat kii media ko aane vaale kai saal ke liye badal diya
 At that time the figure of 1 lakh 76 thousand was printed as a headline in thick fonts
 log ise padhakar hairat main pad jate the
 The 2G revelations on the cover of Outlook and Open magazine created a sensation
 outluk ne radia tepe chhap diya
 On the cover of this CAG Vinod Rai was printed like a hero
 inke liye sheershak laga tha 'da main hu rocked da upie', times aaf india kii hedline bani thi, 'sieji draft report nels raja role in scam', tivi channelon main dibet ne yaheen se ravaanagi pakadi
 Anna Hazare's movement was made in front of the UPA
 centre for media kii ek report he
 Accordingly, in 2011 coverage of corruption cases on TV increased by 11 times as compared to 2005
 kya iske peeche koi plot tha yaa phir media ne sieji kii baat par bhi bharosa kiya
 Many journalists in the media went beyond the CAG report and were also doing research, and also reporting
 aaj sabake bari hone ke sandarbh main jinhone propeganda kiya wo bhi, jinhone patrakarita kii wo bhi, sab ek hi qatari main nazar aate hai
 Hartosh Singh Bal of Caravan magazine did a big adventure reporting at the time
 unka kahana he ki puure media ko khaarij karnaa sahi nahin hoga
 Hartosh Singh Bal was in the open magazine at that time, the cover of which was full of 2G news
 haratosh kii baat main dam he ki sari report ko khaarij karnaa mushkil he
 The role in the CBI investigation should be questioned as to how many people survived, but when no evidence is found, then who should ask that question, Vinod Rai is there, is it right that the CAG officer was right forcibly to ask him The report was signed
 aar ke singh ab duniya main nahin hai
 Congress spokesperson Manish Tiwari has said that the media should introspect
 media ke zarie desh main dooshit maahaul taiyaar kiya gaya
 On the print website, Shekhar Gupta has written that 'the telecom scam was at that time
 ghotaalaa bahut bada tha magar koi iske bare main jaj ko bataanaa bhul gaya
 Like big scams, it was also erected in such a way that it could not stand in court
 abhiyojan paksh, is maamle main sibiai kaa itnaa raajnneetikaran ho gaya, raajnneetik hiton ke kaaran bade-bade myth rach die gaye, andolanon kaa silsilaa chalaa, ki kisi ne parvaah hi nahin ki tathyon kii padtaal bhi kii jaae
 Will have to see what his focus was, sending him to jail or getting a place in the headline
 ' Did everything happen like a game
 saat saal se supreme court nigaraanee kar rahaa tha tab phir sibiai ne kaise saboot nahin pesh kiye, kaise apana kaam nahin kiya or saare aaropee chhot gaye yaa phir yah maanane ke paryaapt kaaran hai ki sibiai jaj ke saamne saboot hi nahin pesh kar pai
 Judge OP Saini has written that he kept waiting every day from morning till evening that someone would come with evidence, nobody came
 to ab kya mana jaae, kya adaalat ke faisle ko nahin maane ki koi ghotaalaa nahin hua yaa faisle ke baad bhi vahi kiya jaae to 2010 se 2017 tak hota rahaa ki ghotaalaa hua tha
 Who ate 1 lakh 76 thousand crores
 ye kiski jeb main gaya
 The accused did not go into the pockets of those who saved them, but who is the one who saved them
 2ji ghotaale ke kawarej ne tivi ke charitra ko badal diya
 This was the same period when TV debated
 anna andolan ke kawarej main tivi ke banaae saare formet dhwast ho gaye
 For several hours, the movement went live on TV
 sansad main bijepi ghotaale ko lekar sarkaar par aarope laga rahi thi
 People of the UPA government looked everywhere like the accused
 siemas media lab kii report bataati he ki 2009 se tivi par bhrashtachar ke kawarez kaaphi bad gaye the
 2G, CWG, Adarsh and Bofors related to Govt
 siemas kii report bataati he ki 2ji ko times of india or hindustan times ne duusare akhabaaron ke mukaable zyaada kawarej kiya
 English news channels got more coverage of the 2G scam in TV
 tippaniyan You know the condition of Bofors
 hedline hi banati he, aarope sabit nahin hota he
 On December 22, the Bombay High Court ruled that the Adarsh scam accused Congress leader Ashok Chavan would not be tried
 jab yah ghotaalaa saamne aayaa tha tab ashok chwahaan maharashtra ke mukhyamantri the
 TV had changed a lot during the 2G scam
 reporting band ho gai, pravachan chaalu ho gaya
 A
 Raja is about to write the book to reveal those who hatched the conspiracy and executed it, those in the CAG and CVC institutions
 kya unki kitaab hi antim raay hogi yaa phir 2ji ko lekar hedline hi banati rahegi, jhooth bolkar logon ko thaga jaataa rahegaa yaa kya yah sansthaaon kii zimmedaari nahin banati he ki itane bade ghotaale ko anjaam tak pahunchaaen yaa phir logon se kahen ki koi ghotaalaa nahin tha
 Lalu Yadav has got excited by this decision in Bihar
 chaara ghotaalaa maamle main agle hafte faisla aa saktaa he
 Lalu Yadav says that the Special Court's decision in Amit Shah's case has not been challenged yet
 sibiai nishpaksh tareeke se kaam nahin kar rahi he
 Vinod Rai believes that it was a large amount
 kya yah chaalaaki thi
 Even then it was a huge amount, so how to accept that there is no one to blame
 kya hisaab lagane vaale ne khyaali pilav banaaya yaa jaanch karne vaale ne sara pilav kha liya
 If those who are insisting that there was a scam then why are they not emphasizing how the accused got acquitted

 Arjun Tendulkar, son of legendary batsman Sachin Tendulkar, has not found a place in the 30 probables of the under-14 team

 The last time Arjun was a part of Mumbai's winning Under-14 team, but this time he will not even be a part of the off-season camp
 mumbai cricket association ke sutron ke mutabik, arjuna ne acha parform nahin kiya, isliye unhen shaamil kiye jane kii koi vajah nahin thi
 He has been asked to improve his game and join the junior team of Mumbai
 emsie dwaara garmiyon kii chhuttiyon main yojit maichon main vah 50 tak score bhi nahin pahunchaa paae
 After this, the selectors gave the batsmen another chance, in which they could not show amazing
 iske alaava arjuna kii fielding ko lekar bhi samasyaayein hai
 The comments silector ne yah bhi kaha ki arjuna ko kai log koching de rahe hai, iske baavjood unki fielding aaj ke maanakon ke hisaab se kahin nahin thaharti
 They need to improve the game significantly
 unki ballebaaji acchhee he, lekin unhen anya khilaadiyon kii tarah acchhee shuruyaat ko bade score main badalanaa hoga
 According to MCA sources, Arjun also has to understand that being the son of Sachin Tendulkar will not make everything easy for him
 unhen kadi mehnat kerani hogi
 Maybe after 2 years people will see a different Arjuna
 pichhali baar arjuna mumbai kii vijeta under 14 team kaa hissaa rahe the, lekin is baar vah of sijan camp kaa hissaa bhi nahin ban paaenge
 According to sources in the Mumbai Cricket Association, Arjun did not perform well, so there was no reason for his inclusion
 unhen kaha gaya he ki vah khel sudhaar karke mumbai kii junior team main aaen
 He could not even score till 50 in matches organized by MCA during the summer holidays
 iske baad chayankartaaon ne ballebaajon ko ek or mauka diya, isamen bhi vah kamaal nahin dikhaa paae
 Apart from this, there are also problems with Arjun's fielding
 tippaniyan The selector also said that despite many people coaching Arjun, his fielding does not remain anywhere according to today's standards
 unhen khel main kaaphi sudhaar laane kii jarurat he
 His batting is good, but like other players he will have to turn a good start into a big score
 emsie ke sutron ke mutabik, arjuna ko yah bhi samajhnaa hoga ki sachin tendulkar kaa betaa hone kii vajah se unke liye sabhi chijen aasaan nahin ho jaaengi
 They have to work hard
 ho saktaa he ki 2 saal baad log ek alag arjuna ko dekhen

 loksabhaa chunaavon ke maddenjar shuru main jise vipaksh ke khilaaf narendra modi sarkaar kaa sargical strike bataaya ja rahaa tha, centre sarkaar kii ore se aarthik rup se pichde varg (edadbralues) ke liye 10 pratishat kaa vah aarakshan ab bihar kii raajnneeti main har kisi ke liye dodhari talwaar banataa dikh rahaa he
 Where the BJP is hopeful that the quota of EWW will be helpful in getting the votes of the forward castes in their favor
 vahiin party kaa pradesh netritv is baat ko lekar bahut sajag he ki bihar kii jatigat raajnneeti ko dekhte hue use saavdhaanee se santulan banaakar chalanaa hoga taaki baaki jatiyon kaa samarthan bhi barkaraar rahe
 The number of forward castes in Bihar is around 12 percent, which is very important in some constituencies by count
 10 pratishat aarakshan ke daanv se bhaajapa, jo haal ke vidhansabha chunaavon main haar ke baad sahami lag rahi thi, ummid kar rahi he ki vah vipaksh ko maat de sakati he
 But only the support of forward castes is not enough
 bhaajapa yaa puraa endie apni yah chhavi banane kaa saahas nahin kar saktaa he ki vah obisi or ati pichhadi jati (ibisi) ke voton kii andekhi karke keval agadi jatiyon kii hitaishi he
 The challenge before the BJP and its allies is to make sure that, while appeasing the forward castes, it does not appear anti-obc from anywhere
 jatiyon ke vyapak rup se dhruvikaran vaale bihar main agadi jatiyon or obisi ke bich gathjod safal nahin rahaa he
 Soon after this decision of the Center, bjp's ally Nitish Kumar's JD (U) and Mukesh rival Lalu Prasad Yadav's RJD demanded an increase in the reservation limit
 bhaajapa ne bhi 2021 tak taaja jaateey janaganana kii baat shuru kar di he
 The JD (U) leadership has supported the latest census in view of the opportunity
 bihar ke rajnatik varg ne edadbralues aarakshan par jis teji se pratikriya di he, vah akaaran nahin he kyonki bihar main jati behad samvedansheel mudda rahaa he or bhaajapa ko acchhee tarah yaad he ki 2015 ke vidhansabha chunaav main use sharmnaak haar kaa munh dekhnaa padaa tha
 a leader of the NDA also believes that Lalu Yadav had cleverly taken advantage of the anti-reservation statement of Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat
 2015 ke vidhansabha chunaavon ke samay lalu prasad yadav ne bhaajapa ko aarakshan virdohi bataaya tha
 In fact, after the announcement of 10 percent reservation for EWWLS, if the BJP has started demanding to increase the reservation limit for other castes, it is because the BJP does not want to lose its base in EBC, OBC and Scheduled Castes
 bihar main vipaksh ke netaa tejasvi yadav ne haalanki edadbralues ko die gaye aarakshan kaa virodh nahin kiya he lekin unhone bhi sarkari naukariyon or shiksha sansthaaon main obisi, ibisi or essi-asti ke liye aarakshan kii maujuuda seemaa badhaakar 90 pratishat kiye jane kii maang kii he
 They have also demanded reservation in private sector jobs
 is samay essi, asti or anya pichhadi jatiyon (obisi) ke liye 50 pratishat aarakshan kii seemaa nirdhaarit he
 On the other hand, the Congress is worried that the BJP can maintain its own vote bank of the forward castes in Bihar
 udhar, bhaajapa ko bhi chintaa he ki is faisle se pichhadi jatiyaan kahin usase naaraaz na ho jaaen
 It will be interesting to see in whose favor the result of this game of reservation in caste-sensitive Bihar goes

 From 1 April 1947 to 29 January 1948, his prayers have special significance
 desh bantane or azaad hone ke saath hindu muslim dangon ke zahreele dhuen main kho gaya tha
 Gandhi was watching everything with his burning eyes

 What do fathers do when they return from office? Written the study twenty-two and a half, only to be overwhelmed

 So make your father love you
 unase puuchhie ki naukari main aane ke baad aapane koun si kitaab padhi he? dahez ke paise kaa kya kya kiya? unhen acchhee kitabon ke naam bataaen
 Along with them, you also study
 meraa maananaa he ki hindi pradesh ke pitaaon ne samaaj main nark machaa rakhaa he
 Whatever the mother makes with so much love and hard work, all these fathers flow into the water
 aap gaur se dekhie, nahin padhane vaale pita kitne jhel hote hai
 They are communal
 pita hai to pyaar se hi puuchhiega
 No one should be insulted
 dhire se puuchhie dead thodaa aap bhi padhaa karo na
 Give books to mother too
 kuch pita to bacchon ko padhaane ke chakkar main dobaaraa se metric kar rahe hote hai, aise gudi gudi dead se bhi kahie ki dead kool gandhi ji par kuch padhate hai na
 Dad will study, the country will grow

 Taking up the case, Adhir Ranjan Chaudhary said that India exports meat worth Rs 28 thousand crore but lions and babur lions are being given to chicken in Uttar Pradesh zoos instead of meat
 unhone kaha ki prakruti kii ek jaivik vyavastha he jisamen sabhi kaa jinda rahanaa jaruri he lekin abhi kaha ja rahaa he ki maance kaa upbhog band kar denge
 Raising the issue, the Congress MP questioned the government, whether lions and babur lions will also be asked to stay after eating spinach cheese? It is significant that during the election campaign, BJP has decided to close illegal slaughterhouses running in the state

 At the behest of Andhra Pradesh CM Chandrababu Naidu, Mamata finally agreed to break the strike
 lekin iske saath hi dilli main modi sarkaar ke khilaaf agle hafte unhone hallabol bolne kaa elaan bhi kar diya he
 Mamta Banerjee is now preparing to travel to Delhi after announcing to end the sit-in in Kolkata, Delhi on 12 February 
 kolkata ke manch se mamata ne kaha ki 12, 13 or 14 farvari ko dilli main modi sarkaar ke khilaaf pradarshan par charchaa chal rahi he
 Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh Chandrababu reached Naidu on Tuesday evening to celebrate Mamtamamata, who was persuaded by Naidu
 unhone kaha ki 23 partiyon ne mamata banerjee se dharna khatm karne kii apil kii he
 This battle will now be fought in Delhi
 vahiin mamata ne kaha ki main desh ko ekajute karne kii koshish kar rahi hum
 Mamta defended her police again
 dharna khatm karne kaa elaan karte hue mamata ne kaha ki piem modi sab par kabja karnaa chaahate hai
 They will now have to leave Delhi and go to Gujarat
 46 ghante chalaa dharnagrih mantralay ke patr par mamata ne kaha ki uskaa jawaab diya jayega
 This is a useless thing
 mamata ne kaha ki ve agle saptaah dilli jaaengi
 If you want to save the country, Modi has to be removed

 At the election time, Chandrababu accepted Mamta's rise in the politics of opposition to Modi without any reason

 Significantly, Chandrababu was the first person who banned the CBI from entering his state
 isi silsile ko mamata ne bhi aage badhaayaa or ab sibiai ke naam par sidhe-sidhe modi sarkaar se do-do haath kar rahi hai
 In the spirit of support from other parties, Mamta has announced that Modi will not win the next election
 bengal congress naakhush!mamata ke badhate kad se saare modi virdohi khush hai, aisa bhi nahin he
 There are claims of many leaders in the post of PM in the alliance, so jumping the name of one may upset the rest
 bengal congress main bhi yahi chintaa dikh rahi he
 That is why despite the support of Mamta from the central leaders, the state leaders are giving statements like dissolution of the government

 Senior Congress leader Ahmed Patel said on Saturday that the results of the recently concluded assembly elections indicate that the BJP is going to be out of power at the Center
 gujarat ke sabarkantha jile ke himmatnagar main ek raily ko sambodhit karte hue patel ne kaha ki madhya pradesh, rajasthan or chhattisgarh ke nattejey dikhaate hai ki logon kaa bajapi se moh bhang ho gaya he
 Patel said that when you came to power in 2014 by making false promises and spreading lies, you would not have thought that you will become unpopular in just four years
 logon kaa ab bijepi se mohabhang ho gaya he
 Hence Congress won assembly elections in three states
 patel ne kaha ki jab 2014 main aap satta main aae to aapane sochaa ki aap hameshaa shashan karenge
 This was your boast
 aapane yah ehsaas nahin kiya agar janata aapako satta main laa sakati he to vah aapako baahar bhi kar sakati he
 The Congress leader said that the time has come for you (modi) to step down
 agar aap pad nahin chhodte hai to log aapse aisa karavaaenge
 Taking a dig at Modi, he said that one cannot become a leader like Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru by wearing only a "nehru jacket"
 patel ne sawaal kiya ki aap videshi dauron par jaakar indira gandhi bhi nahin ban sakate
 You cannot become Rajiv Gandhi by wearing designer jackets and kurtas
 aise netaaon kii jamaat main shaamil hone ke liye, aapako unki tarah tyaag karnaa hota he
 Do you have the courage to do this? Modi recently said that Kartarpur in Punjab had moved to Pakistan at the time of independence due to "lack of attitude" among Congress leaders
 modi kii is tippanee ke sandarbh main patel ne sawaal kiya ki kya modi us samay ke varisht congressi netaa sardaar vallabhbhai patel ko bhi jimmedaar tehra rahe hai
 He said that on one side you are making a statue of Sardar Patel and on the other side you are insulting him
 patel ne kaha ki modi or bijepi yah daawa karne ke liye itihaas mitaane kaa prayaas tathaa ‘‘todmarodakar baaten’’ kar rahe hai ki congressi netaaon ne desh ke liye kuch nahin kiya

 is vakt ham sabhi india or australia ke bich ho rahi border-gavaskar trophy ke bare main baaten kar rahe hai, lekin ham sab bhul rahe hai ki bharat ke khilaadi ek bahut bada karnama kar aae hai
 Do you know what this act is? 
 
 ? shaayad bahut kam log jaanate honge yaa ruchi rakhte honge
 i did not even know, later found out
 chaliye, aapaki duvidha dur kar dete hai
 India's blind cricket team has won the trophy by defeating Pakistan in the Blind Cricket World Cup final held in South Africa
 
 
 to main aaj in khilaadiyon se mila or bahut khushi hui
 
 
 And i am sharing with you the information received from them
 
 
 south africa main 27 november se 7 disambar tak khele gaye blind worldcup main india, pakistan, bangladesh, australia, england, srilanka or mejabaan south africa ne hissaa liya tha
 17 players from 10 different states of India were selected for this tournament
 toornament ke semifinal main bharat ne srilanka ko or pakistan ne england ko haraaya
 Coach Patrick Rajkumar says that India adopted a new strategy against Bangladesh during the league match, which no team had used till date
 bharat ne chaar kii jagah chah bi-1 khilaadiyon ko mauka diya
 Actually, B-1 are players who are completely blind
 chah aise khilaadiyon ke saath khelte hue bhi bharat ne bangladesh ko 111 ran par olout kar diya or bina wicket khoe hue 12 over main hi lakshya hasil kar liya
 Let us now talk about the final match
 ham sabhi jaanate hai ki bharat or pakistan ke bich match kitna manoranjak hota he, or is blind worldcup kaa final inhen donon chir-pratidwandvi deshon ke bich hi hua
 While batting first, Pakistan scored a mammoth score of 389 in 40 overs thanks to a brilliant 102 from Muhammad and brilliant half-centuries from Nisar Ali, Mohammad Akram and Anees Javed
 
 It seemed that perhaps India would not reach such a big target
 yah target us vakt or bhi zyaada dur lagane laga, jab team india ne keval 49 ran par do wicket ganvaa die, jinamein captain shekhar nayak shaamil the
 But the coach's confidence in the players remained, and then Haryana's Deepak Malik and Andhra's Venkatesh shared a century partnership for the third wicket to pave the way for India's victory
 iske baad paanchaven wicket ke liye prakaash jairamaiya or ajay reddy ne 134 ranon kii partnership kar bharat ko jeet dilaa di
 For India, Prakash Jayaramiah played a brilliant innings of 84 runs in 38 balls
 vaise, 'main of da match' or 'main of da series' chune gaye gujarat ke chetan bhai patel ne 76 or andhra ke ajay reddy ne bhi 74 ranon kaa yogadan diya
 Just think, if our normal cricket team had done this, what would not have happened now
 tivi ke saamne sabhi log baithe hote, khushi manaai ja rahi hoti or bisisiai kitne hi inaamon kii ghoshnaa kar chuki hoti
 Apart from this, announcements of reward of different amount would be made continuously from different states
 kitna ajeeb he, in netraheen khilaadiyon kii koi kadra nahin
 Well, it is a good thing that Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi himself met these players and encouraged them
 khel mantralay ne in khilaadiyon ko paanch-paanch lakh rupee dene kii ghoshnaa kii he
 Sadly, nothing was provided to the support staff
 duniya ke sabase amir cricket board bisisiai kii taraf se bhi kisi raashi kii ghoshnaa nahin kii gai
 
 
 The Americans imposed all sanctions on Iran on 5 November but gave relief to the Chabahar Port Project

 In a conversation with India Today, a representative of the US State Department said that on this condition the project has been relieved that no ban will be sent from here
 gahan vichaar vimarsh ke baad chabahaar ko chhot di gai he
 The US minister, Mike Pompeo, imposed the ban, saying it was extremely important to exert economic pressure on Iran
 iske tahat iran se tel aayaat ko shunya karnaa he lekin halaat ko dekhte hue 8 deshon ko isse raahat di gai he
 These include China, India, Greece, South Korea, Taiwan and Turkey, including India
 ye ve desh hai jo iran se tel aayaat par kramshah katautee karnaa jari rakhe hue hai
 There are 2 of these countries which have completely banned import of crude oil from Iran
 america sabhi deshon se baat kar rahaa he ki iran se tel kaa aayaat khatm karen
 On November 5, suspensions were in place at Chabahar Port and the International North South Trade Corridor (INSTC)
 mangalvaar ko america ke state department ne kaha ki afghanistan ke vikaas ko dekhte hue chabahaar or INSTC ko pratibandh se chhot de di gai he
 What is Chabahar Project India is developing Chabahar Bandragah in Iran

 The practice of divorcing the Supreme Court three times has been declared illegal

 Although the Aligarh police registered a case under other sections of torture, they also approached the concerned parties and spoke of their efforts for reconciliation
 lekin tripal talaak ko lekar kanoon kii gaiyr maujuudagi main police kii asamarthta ko jaahir ho gai

 tripal talaak ke maamle main modi sarkaar ne muslim mahilaon ke paksh mensupreme court main ise khatmakarne kii vakaalat kii thi
 The government argued that triple talaq is neither mentioned in the Quran nor is it prevalent in 22 Muslim countries of the world including Saudi Arabia, Pakistan

 Now before the Gujarat Assembly elections, the Modi government has spoken of bringing laws on the divorce

 It is possible that the approval of the cabinet will be taken after finalizing the draft of the law before the election

 Pakistan will be our neighbor and neighbor
 aage teen hafte main kya hota he, yah aage dekhte hai
 But there is a difference between negotiation and negotiation
 baatcheet raah chalate ho sakati he, lekin vaarta alag-alag muddon par charchaa se hoti he
 2
 aapane myanmar main hamalaa kar manipur kaa badla lene kii saraahna kii
 People want to know that such an operation will be done against Dawood? Answer: Maybe, but there will be no discussion before doing it
 yah is par nirbhar karata he ki sarkaar kya darja detii he, special oparation yaa cowart oparation
 It may have never been a discussion of the Covet operation
 special oparation kii charchaa pehle nahin, baad main ho sakati he
 It is the decision of the government when to do it
 ho saktaa he abhi ho rahaa ho, ho saktaa he nahin ho rahaa ho

 Dossiers will be given and everything else will also be done
 OROP par bole- aasaan nahin tha lagu karnaarajyavardhan ne kaha ki van rank, van pension (OROP) ko lagu karnaa aasaan nahin tha
 Even if it is given in writing now, there will be difficulty in further modification
 congress par saadhaa nishanaarajyavardhan ne OROP ke mudde par congress par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki jis sarkaar ne 40 saal tak ise lagu nahin kiya uske khilaaf koi dharna nahin
 Strike against the government which is implementing in one and a half years, is it right? adaalat main chal rahe is maamle ko lekar hamen yakeen tha ki baba ram rahim insaan isse batch jaaenge
 After all, when our Dera chief is taking care of raising so many girls, then how can he target someone's honor
 ham log guuruuvaar raat se hi meditation par baithe the
 Hoping that everything would be alright
 lekin faisla ummid se ulat aayaa
 We are disappointed with this decision
 puure parivaar main kisi ne subah se khaanaa nahin khaaya he or rah-rahakar apane guru ke liye ankhon main aansu aa rahe hai
 Ram Rahim's face was blown before going to jail, see the first picture, imagine how a family person can rape
 court ke faisla sahi nahin he
 a conspiracy has been hatched against Baba Ram Rahim Insan
 varsh 2007 main unki dress par jo vivaad hua tha, usee ko lekar unke virodhiyon ne unako fansaaya he
 Such circumstances were created against him that he might get trapped
 aakhir jinhone veshyaaon ko bachaaya, wo kaise aisa kar sakate hai
 Baba Ram Rahim Insan has 3 daughters and lives with the family
 unki 3 betiyon main se ek god lee hui he
 How can a father with daughters act like a rape
 ram rahim arest, saat sau acre ke mahal se pahunche ambala gelor phir sawaal to yah bhi uthta he ki rape cese main baba hi kyon fanse
 Rape cases have been going on for many years in many courts
 baba achche kaam or limlite main the isliye un par ye gaaj giri he
 They have been implicated here
 baba ne kabhi kisi party ko saport nahin kiya
 He always said that the country should vote for what it thinks is right
 phir hamaare guru ne to aapadaaon ke samay bhi sarkaar kii madad hi kii he
 Wherever accidents or calamities came, the people of the Dera went and cooperated as much as possible
 deraa samarthakon kaa tandav jari, in tasveeron ko dekh dahal jayega dilgumraah ho saktaa he kanoonkanoon bhi gumraah ho saktaa he
 If the Guru is not God then the law is also not God
 phir adaalat main pesh karne ke liye saboot to banaae ja sakate hai
 Everyone understands how easy it is in today's era
 hamaare guru ne samarthakon ko waapas jane ko kaha tha
 But there was no means of return as the buses and trains were already canceled
 vahiin bheed kaa phayda unke anti group uthaa rahe hai
 There is no rush to return and in the meantime, the people sent by the protesters are doing such activities which spoil the name of the chief of the camp and his supporters
 dere ke folbers lagaataar fasebuk par ashram main rah rahi bacchiyon ke video paste kar rahe hai
 Through this, they want to hear from them what they are saying and can tell how safe they are here
 lekin is baat ko kisi ne bhi nahin dikhaaya
 You should also know that the Dera supporters are being harassed in the offices too
 hamaari jaankaree main kisi ko meeting main isliye nahin shaamil hone diya gaya kyonki vah deraa samarthak he or ram rahim insaan ko apana guru maanate hai
 In such a situation, it has come to leave his job
 (lekhika ek aise parivaar kaa hissaa hai jahaan deraa pramukh baba ram rahim ko bhagwaan mana jaataa he
 How he and his family look at this decision of the court and the circumstances following it is being presented here in their own words
 yah lekhika ke nijee vichaar hai
 We are putting his side here without revealing his identity

 ) Akshay Kumar is not an Indian citizen
 yah baat mumbai main voting ke dauraan saamne ai
 Many stars voted
 unki patni tvinkal ne bhi vot daalaa
 But Akshay Kumar was not in this list, because he has taken Canadian citizenship
 lekin kya naagarikta na hone se akshay kuch kam bhartiya ho jate hai
 
 
 The Incidentally, in the last few years, he has consistently done films that deal with patriotism
 balki kuch atirikt rajbhakti dikhaate hue unhone bilkul sarkari kaaryakramon ko badhaava dene vaali 'toilet - ek prem katha' or 'pedman' jaisi filmein bhi kin
 Moreover, between the elections, he interviewed the Prime Minister and also shared native jokes
 chahen to aap puch sakate hai ki kya pradhanmantri ko kisi videshi ko aisa intervyuu dena chahie tha, lekin is sawaal kaa koi matlab nahin he
 Akshay is a complete Indian, not being an Indian citizen
 yahi baat kuch or sitaron ke bare main kahi ja sakati he, jinaki naagarikta takneekee taur par kisi or desh kii he
 Incidentally, when these lines are being written, then on the question of Rahul Gandhi's citizenship, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra is saying the same thing
 unka kahana he, rahul bharat main paidaa hue or yaheen rahe - unhen koun bahari kah saktaa he
 
 
 ? Those who are unable to tell Akshay Kumar as foreigner are telling Rahul Gandhi
 BJP saansad subrahmanyam swami ne is mudde par supreme court se lautaae jane ke baad grih mantralay main shikaayat kii or grih mantralay ne rahul gandhi ko naagarikta ke sawaal par notice bhej diya
 But the other thing to consider is actually another
 bharat main ab ekal naagarikta kaa kanoon purana pad chukaa he
 According to this law, if a person takes citizenship of another country, he has to renounce Indian citizenship
 lekin isaki vajah se kai log naagarikta ke sawaal par duvidha main ghirte hai or na chaahane ke baavjood apni bhartiya naagarikta chhodane ko majaboor hote hai
 These days there are many people who are moving to other countries in relation to jobs
 vahaan paidaa hone vaali unki santaanen swaabhaavik taur par un deshon kii naagarik ban jaati hai
 If they have to remain Indians, they have to give up citizenship
 aisa nahin ki duusare deshon main based bharatiyon ko ham paraayaa maanane lagate hai
 In the last few years the Prime Minister addressed the Indian people in the countries he visited
 kai deshon main 'modi-modi' ke jo naare guunje, unke peeche bharatvanshi log hi rahe
 It is also true that there is a growing demand for providing legal facilities to overseas Indians
 inhen dinon anivaasee bharatiyon ke liye voting ke adhikaar kii maang tak uthi
 That is, in a way the bonds of single citizenship law are likewise decreasing
 nishchay hi dohari naagarikta ko lekar kai ahm sawaal saamne aaenge
 In which countries will people doing business or jobs taking dual citizenship or who will be bound by judicial procedures, solutions to these questions can be found
 ahm baat yah he ki dohari naagarikta hamaari bhartiyata kaa vistaar karegi
 This will not weaken nationalism, it will only strengthen
 abhi british rajpariwaar ke prince harry or unki american patni megan kii santan aane vaali he
 He will get dual citizenship right from his birth
 vah britain main paidaa hogi, lekin uski maa american he, jo british naagarikta lene kii prakriya main he, lekin jisane apni naagarikta chhodane par faisla nahin kiya he
 If we accept such dual citizenship even here, then many Indians will not be forced to lose their citizenship

 Muslim organization jamaat-e-islami Hind has made a big announcement about the Gujarat assembly elections
 jamaat ne gujarat main ek baar phir bhartiya janata party kii sarkaar banane kii ummid jataai he
 During a conference held in Delhi, Jamaat Islami Hind president Syed Jalaluddin Umri said that the kind of news that is coming, it seems that BJP government will be formed once again
 iske peeche unhone opinian pole kaa bhi hawala diya he
 However, no announcement has been made about who his organization is going to support
 duusari taraf sanghathan ne ye bhi saaf kiya he ki unako nahin lagata gujarat main musalmaan badi sankhya main bijepi ko vot karte hai
 On the one hand, while the organization hoped to return to the BJP government, on the other hand, it also gave a shocking statement to the Congress
 conference main kaha gaya ki rahul gandhi gujarat chunaav ko lekar sakriy to hai, lekin wo bahut asar nahin daal paa rahe hai
 No decision on giving support so far, when the Chairman of Jamaat Islami Hind, Syed Jalaluddin was asked the question of which party the organization was going to support, he pleaded no decision on it
 unhone kaha ki jamaat islamic chunaav main kise samarthan karegi, ye abhi tay nahin kiya gaya he
 However, he also said that the State Committee of the organization is continuously working in the province
 gujarat main jamaat islamic kaa bada asaradrasal, jamaat islamic hind kaa ye bayaan isliye mahatvapurn mana ja saktaa he ki kyonki gujarat main is sanghathan kaa vyapak asar he
 Even in the electoral politics of Gujarat, the organization plays a very important role
 duusari taraf sanghathan kaa ye bayaan ko krongress or rahul gandhi ke liye naseehat ke taur bhi dekha ja rahaa he
 In every assembly election, the Congress has been inviting strong Islamic organizations like Jamiat Ulema-e Hind and Jama'at Islami Hind
 chunaav se pehle in sanghathanon se meeting kar samarthan kii apil kii jaati thi
 But this time it does not look like this
 party ke gujarati netaa bhi maanate hai ki congress muslim votaron par dhyaan dene kii bajaay soft hindutv kii taraf bad rahi he
 This is the reason that till now these organizations have not been called by the party for talks
 gujarat main do charnon main vidhansabha chunaav hone hai
 Voting will be held on December 9 for the first phase and December 14 for the second phase

 Fees: 4,46,000 Seats: 120 yamuna aarti ko lekar dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal or purv mantri kapil mishra ek baar phir se aamane-saamne aa gaye hai
 While on one hand Kapil Mishra took part in Yamuna Aarti this time too, on the other hand Kejriwal cut the edge from it
 isko lekar kapil mishra ne siem kejariwal par jamkar tanj ksaa
 On Saturday, Kapil Mishra, a minister in the Delhi government, organized the Yamuna Aarti in Sonia Vihar area
 dilli main pichley do saal se yamuna aarti kaa aayojan bhaiya dooj ke din kiya ja rahaa he
 Yamuna river is very polluted in the city of Delhi, in such a way that the cleanliness of Yamuna is talked about as soon as it comes near the Chhath Parv, there is some kind of vote bank politics of politicians
 pichley saal sonia vihaar memunaarti ke aayojan par dilli sarkaar kii puri cabinet hajir thi
 However, this time Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal neither attended Kudsia Ghat nor Sonia Vihar's Aarti i
e
 Chief Minister did not think to go anywhere except where your vote bank is
 dilli ke kudasia ghat main uparajyapal ne yamuna aarti kii
 On this occasion, former Delhi government minister Kapil Mishra announced that all the promises made for cleaning the Yamuna were not started till October, so the people of East Delhi, especially Karawal Nagar, Sonia Vihar, Bhajanpura and Ghonda, together He will perform at Kejriwal, the owner of Delhi
 iske saath hi kapil mishra ne apni vidhansabha kii janata se kaha ki arvind kejariwal kaa yamuna prem ab samaapt ho gaya he
 That is why they are discriminating against the people of Yamuna
 is tarah kapil mishra ne jaahir kiya ki kahin naa kahin dilli shahar main oktober ke baad raajnneeti yamuna ke maddenjar kii jaaegi ki aakhir kyon 1998 se ban rahaa signechar brij ab tak nahin bana he? aakhir kyon pichley 25 saal se lagaataar gandi ho rahi yamuna nadi ab tak naale main tabdeel hoti ja rahi he? In a statement, he alleged, 'prime Minister Modi is right that Rajiv Gandhi was corrupt number one, but he was also India's biggest mob lyncher
 ' sirsa ne aarope lagaaya ki gandhi ne na keval sikhon ke khilaaf narsanhaar ko protsaahit kiya, balki isamen shaamil logon kii bhi raksha kii or unhen puraskrit kiya
 Congress President Rahul Gandhi on Sunday responded 'with love and jubilation' to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's taunt of 'corruption number 1' about his late father Rajiv Gandhi, saying that your deeds are waiting for you
 gandhi ne kaha ki modi khud ke bare main apni dharna mere pita par thope rahe hai lekin vah apane aap ko bachaa nahin paayenge kyonki unke liye ladaai khatm ho gai he
 Modi's remarks have been strongly condemned by the Congress and other opposition leaders who believe that the Prime Minister has demoted his office by making such remarks about a former Prime Minister who is not in this world
 lekin bhaajapa ne kaha ki modi ne rajeev gandhi ke bare main jo kuch kaha he, vah har shabd sahi he or yah ki congress pramukh loksabhaa chunaav main apni party kii sambhavit haar se ghabara gayi hai
 Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) chief Raj Thackeray on Sunday slammed and said that the country will not forgive him for this statement
 thakare ne twit kiya, ‘nafrat, antaheen jhooth or saarvajanik jivan kii maryaada langhane main rattibar afsos nahin teen aisi baaten hai jo narendra modi kii pahchaan ban gayi hai
 This is further exacerbated by his latest statements against late Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi

 Even though the leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party or Congress has always been the Chief Minister in Rajasthan, independents have contributed a lot in the politics of the state
 bharat ke aaazaad hone ke baad jab pehali baar rajasthan main chunaav hua to bhi jeetne vaale netaaon main kai nirdaleeyon kaa naam shaamil tha
 Many times the government has been formed due to the independents and this time also the independent leaders are trying to form a third front
 baat saal 1993 kii he, jab kareeb ek salrashtrapatishasan lagu rahane ke baad rajasthan main vidhansabha chunaav ho rahe the
 Earlier, Bhairon Singh Shekhawat was the Chief Minister of the state for two times
 15 disambar 1992 ko mukhyamantri kii kursi khaali ho gai thi
 In the elections held in December 1993, BJP got 0 from Congress

 60% or congress ko 38
 27% of the votes were received

 36 to Congress in 2008 also
 82% or bijepi ko 34
 27% of the votes were received
 us vakt congress ne nirdaleeyon ke saath milakar sarkaar bana lee thi
 Therefore, independents have always occupied many seats in the state
 vahiin is baar bhi nirdaleey vidhayakahanuman beniwaltisare morche ke saath maidan main he
 However, there is a continuous decrease in the number of independents who spoil the game of other candidates in state politics

 This includes non-jatav Dalit castes and some forward castes

 Apart from their traditional Dalit voters, the BSP is also eyeing minority voters
 agar musalamaanon ko ek majboot mahagathbandhan kaa vikalp mil jaataa he to alpsankhyak voter waapas netaji ke paale main aana pasand karenge
 Nitish Kumar has the power to woo the obcs, while 9 per cent Yadav and 18 per cent Muslim votes are the strength of Mulayam Singh Yadav in UP

 However, after the bjp's landslide victory in Uttar Pradesh in the Lok Sabha elections, in 2014, the Samajwadi Party, RJD, JDU, JDS, INLD and Samajwadi Party were united to form a grand alliance
 lekin bihar chunaav se pehle yah gathjod tut gaya
 If this alliance is successful this time, it will be a big victory for the coming general elections for the anti-bjp leaders who are dreaming of becoming PM
 pichley saalaaj hi ke din jab pradhanmantri narendra modi ne notebandi kii ghoshnaa kii, to der raat se hi etiemon ke baahar line lagani shuru ho gai thi
 On the second day, this line started being installed outside the banks besides atms
 lekin kai aise log the, jo khud line par nahin lage, balki unhone is kaam ke liye 'chotu' ko kiraaye par liya
 Putting the 'chhotu' jugaad of a startup on the line, people would do their other jobs and avoid the trouble of standing in line for hours
 'chotu' ko line main lagaakar ek taraf jahaan aam logon ne apane ghanto bachaae, vahiin, ek starop ne is jugad se lakhon rupee kii kamai kii
 He roped in 'book My Chhotu' startup to hire 'chhotu' to install demonetisation choline
 pichley saal notebandi ke dauraan is starop ne is jugad se apana bijness kai guna badhaayaa
 He not only earned a lot of money by providing 'chhotu' to the people to get in line, but also achieved a lot of fame
 aise aayaa idiabuk maay chotuke sansthaapak or siio satjit singh bedi ne Aajtak
 Talking to in told that during demonetisation many people did not want to stand in line
 line main khadey hone kii vajah se unka rosemara kaa kaam prabhavit ho rahaa tha
 To help such people, Book My Chhotu gave an option to hire 'chhotu'
 logon ko mili rahatsatajit ne bataaya ki ham aamtaur parhousakiping bwoijki sarvice muhaiyaa karte hai
 During demonetisation, we gave these people a chance to earn by putting them in line
 hamane logon ko sirf 90 rupee main line main lagane ke liye ladke muhaiyaa karana shuru kiya
 The advantage of this was that people would do their work and these boys would stay in line and reduce their load
 notebandi ne badhaayaa kaarobaarastajit bataate hai ki notebandi ne unka kaarobaar badhaane main ahm bhoomika nibhaai
 He said that he used to have 40 to 50 per cent bookings before demonetisation
 notebandi ke dauraan yah booking 90 se 95 fisadi pahunch gai or ye booking sirf atm or bank kii line main lagane ke liye ho rahi thim
 This not only helped the startup in terms of income, but also became famous overnight
 isse company kaa marketing cost jiro ho gaya
 a year later, the book 'my My Chotu', which shone overnight from its jugaad during the launch of the startup, has not diminished after a year
 starop ke kor team or stratji head govin kandhari kehete hai ki pichley ek saal ke dauraan hamaare starop ne 10 guna growth kiya he or ab hamase zyada log jude hai
 Our booking has also picked up
 ab dayera badhaane par he focusnobandi se starop ko itnaa nem or fame mila ki ab satjit apane kaarobaar ko dilli-ensiaar se baahar lekar jane kii bhi taiyaari kar rahe hai
 For this, he is preparing to bring a franchise model so that he can provide the facility to people in other states of the country
 ab yahaan line par lag rahe starop ke 'chotu'satjit kehete hai ki notebandi ke baad ab unke 'chotu' ko log aspataal, bank or anya kai jagahon par line main lagane ke liye kiraaye par le rahe hai
 He explains that we rent housekeeping boys to the common people on an hourly basis
 vah bataate hai ki aapke ghar main shaadi he or aap kuch nipataane main madad chaahate hai, to book maay chotu ke saath ladakon ko ghanton ke hisaab se kiraaye par le sakate hai or apana kaam nipta sakate hai

 He used to rotate three countries like this

 kya thi ranneeti?vijayendra ne keaar pete ke votaron ko is kshetra se yediurppa parivaar kii jaden hone kii vajah se bhaavnaatmak rishta bataaya
 The BJP instead emphasized on the development of the caste card
 ranneeti sidhi thi- ‘logon ko yaad dilaanaa ki yediurppa ne 2008 main siem rahete apane chunaav kshetra ke liye kya-kya kiya tha
 Increased the subsidy on milk by four rupees and started 108 ambulance service which helped the rural sector '
 keaar pete ke votaron ko sandesh saaf tha ki agar bijepi yahaan se jiti to mukhyamantri yediurppa yahaan kii tasviir palat denge
 Vijayendra said, 'mandya had never seen a BJP MLA or MP
 jab ham vahaan gaye to hamane vahaan kisi tarah kaa vikaas nahin dekha
 We were surprised to see no proper roads and connectivity in the villages
 kshetra main bijepi pratinidhi nahin hote hue bhi yediurppa ne 850 karod kaa fund jari kiya’
 The BJP also avoided direct attacks on Deve Gowda and Kumaraswamy in the region
 keaar pete main 96,000 vokkalinga or 16,000 lingayat voter hai
 Instead, BJP pointed out how Kumaraswamy, who came from Vokkalinga community because of Yeddyurappa, first became CM in Karnataka, Sadanand Gowda became CM, r Ashok became deputy CM
 vijayendra ke mutabik is kshetra main bijepi kii jeet kii badi vajah yah bhi rahaa ki vipaksh ne hamen halke main liya, ise apana garh maanate hue unhone soch rakhaa tha ki yahaan se bijepi nahin jeet sakati
 The Delhi government has issued a legal notice to the directors, producers and actors of the film 'badhai Ho' released on October 18 asking them to remove smoking scenes

 We have issued a legal notice on these things only
 "unhone kaha ki yah kanoonee notice film ke nirdeshak, nirmaataaon or kalakaaron ko bheja gaya he
 In such a situation, there has been a demand for immediate removal of such scenes from the film
 yah pehali baar nahin he, jab dilli swasthya vibhaag ne bollywood se is prakaar ke drishyon ko hataane kii maang kii he
 Arora said, “we have written to Bollywood several times in this regard
 bollywood kalakaaron or filmon main apane aadarsho ko dekhte hue yuva bhi unki aadaton ko apnaane kii koshish karte hai
 In such a situation, Bollywood should set its own values and understand its responsibility towards the people
 janata ke hit ko dekhte hue patakatha bhi badali ja sakati he
 "earlier, the health department had also issued a legal notice to Khiladi Kumar Akshay Kumar
 is par aroda ne kaha, "ek ore akshay ko swasthya sambandhi abhiyaanon kaa vigyaapan karte hue dekha jaataa he, vahiin duusari ore 'gold' film main unhen baar-baar dhumrapaan karte hue dikhaaya gaya he
 These types of things can be ignored

 Today in the University Series, we are giving you news from an important stronghold of agricultural education in the country
 hamaara yah 27 waan ank he
 Pantnagar Agricultural University is the first agricultural university in India
 1960 main bani is uniwarsity kii viraasat bahut gahari he
 The Ohio State University of America, Kansas State University, Illinois University, Pennsylvania State University and University of Missouri supported
 iske liye 1959 main illinois uniwarsity ne blue print taiyaar kiya tha
 By then, the first agricultural university was established in India
 jiskaa baad main naam padaa govindballabh pant krishi or prodyogiki vishvavidhyalay
 This partnership of India and America was so successful that it created 31 other agricultural universities across the country
 iske chaatr krishi ke kshetra main duniya bhar main chhaae hue hai
 When Clinton was president in the US, his agriculture ministry deputy secretary Islam Siddiqui was a student of this university
 uniwarsity kaa campus itnaa bada he ki iske bheetar sadakon kaa jaal he, colony he, aspataal he, bazaar he, 6 primary skool hai, 3 secondary skool hai
 You will find this university in Udham Singh Nagar of Uttarakhand
 uniwarsity kii website par likhaa he ki yahaan 763 shikshak hai, iske alaava 59 technical staff hai or baaki sab milakar 2878 karmchaaree hai
 2800–3000 students study here
 ek shikshak par 6 chaatro kaa ausat he
 We were shocked that just six students on one teacher
 bharat kii kisi bhi uniwarsity main yah anupaat shaayad hi mili
 You have seen in the university series that in many places there is a ratio of 500 to 1200 students on one teacher
 hamaare sahyogi dinesh mansera ne jo report bheji he ham vah bhi dekh lete hai
 According to Dinesh, 4500 students study here whereas on the website it is written that 2800 to 3000 are read
 shikshak sangh ke adhyaksh ne jo shikshakon kii sankhya bataai he wo website par di gai usase kaaphi alag he
 Yes, there have been vacancies of about two hundred teachers for many years
 dhai hazaar se zyaada karmchaariyon ke pad khaali hai
 These include lab staff, staff, other assistant positions
 kai pad to yahaan bees-bees saal se khaali bataae gaye hai
 With which dream was this university built in 1959 and in 2017 you are seeing the ruins of this dream
 ye baat aap kisi netaa ke bhaashan main nahin sunenge
 Speeches are also strange
 lakhon karodon rupee karch kar reliyaan yojit kii jaati hai taaki koi netaa khud ko garib bataa sake
 What can be more ironic than this
 pant nagar uniwarsity main 14 shodh college chalate hai
 Its research institutes are spread across 9 districts
 magar yahaan ke hostalon main ganda pani aata he, shauchalay toote phute hai, sillen bhari deevaaren hai or karaab khaane kii shikaayat to aam baat he
 One more thing came to know that there is a lunch time of one o'clock to three o'clock, during which many works are stopped
 chaatro kii haalat yah he ki ve fasebuk par hi india kii demokrasi celibratt kar rahe hai, camere par aakar apni uniwarsity kii haalat par ek line nahin bol sakate kyonki ham sabane sweekaar kar liya he ki bol dene se skool college se naam cat jayega yaa netaa jail bhijwa degaa
 There is no student union in such a large university
 hakeekat maaloom he magar kehete samay use itnaa halkaa kar do ki baat bhi ho jaae or lage bhi na ki baat kii gai he
 The Vice Chancellor himself is saying that we do not stay anywhere
 sabaki jubaan par ranking aa gai he
 This is the new Shiguafa to dodge
 jaldi hi zile ke collejon kii rekking hone lagegi or usee main log khush rahenge
 The same thing happened with Miss World, Miss Nainital and Miss Rohtak have also started happening
 dinesh mansera ne bataaya he ki pichley saat saal se koi sthaayee vaais chancelar nahin rahaa
 This is the situation of the world school from which research is to be conducted on agriculture, experts are born for farming
 slogan se hi aamadani dugani ho jaaegi lagata he
 The employees union is also worried about the pension
 30-30 saal se pension kaa hissaa katwate rahe or use paane ke liye ladate phir rahe hai
 The government says that we have given our share and now the university has raised the remaining funds itself
 yahi nahin 2002 main uttarakhand sarkaar ne pant nagar uniwarsity krishi form kii 3339 acre zamin lekar vahaan audyogic kshetra bana daalaa
 Sources told Dinesh Mansera that neither the Agriculture Minister of the Manmohan Singh Government nor the Agriculture Minister of the Modi Government have stepped here
 uniwarsity series main ham gujarat yaa kai anya rajya cover nahin kar paae
 Due to resource constraints
 haal hi main rahul gandhi ne apane toun haul main ek professor ranjana avasthi ko gale laga liya
 There is a video of the Congress, not ours, first you hear what Sanskrit professor Ranjana Awasthi is saying
 koshish kii he ki hamaare saath alag se baat ho jaae magar safalataa nahin mili, dar ne logon kii aisi haalat kar di he
 Ranjana Awasthi's salary was 12000 after teaching Sanskrit for 22 years at NB Patel College, Ahmedabad
 kya aap duniya ke kisi bhi uniwarsity main koi ek naukari bataa sakate hai jahaan 22 saal kaam karne ke baad professor kii tankhwaah 12000 hoti he
 This example is not only from Gujarat, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh to Delhi University
 sochie 22 saal kii naukari ke baad tankhwaah 12000
 Even after this exploitation, emotional issues continue in our politics
 jaise dilli uniwarsity main edock hota he, madhya pradesh main guest teacher ko atithi vidwaan kehete hai usee tarah gujarat main asthai naukariyon ke liye samay samay par nai shabdaawalee kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 After talking to the teachers there, two types of permutations were found
 phul time permanent or part time permanent
 i heard Part Time Permanent for the first time
 blendar mistek, ritern back jaisaa lagata he part time permanent
 Part time is written in the appointment letter, but while teaching part time in the same college, they start calling themselves part time permanent
 ye sab udhaaharan bataate hai ki agar sarkaar chaahe to logon se bina paise hi zindagi bhar kaam kara sakati he or log kaam bhi kar lenge
 We talked to Shah of Dinesh, Dinesh Bhai continued to teach as part time permanent teacher for 35 years
 ek hi college main 1980 se 2015 tak part time padhaate rahe
 i joined a salary of 2500 in 1980
 2015 main ritair hue to selary hui 12000
 Dinesh Bhai taught law in the same college
 35 saal baad dinesh bhai college se nikle to unke haath main kuch nahin tha
 Neither pension nor any social security
 gujarat main 1998 main part time or edock niyuktiyon par roak laga di
 300 part time teachers have survived
 ye sabhi bees-bees saal se padhaa rahe hai
 Six months ago, it has been decided that those who have phd will get 40,000 salary but neither will get the arrears nor any other facility
 gujarat main edock padhaa rahe ek shikshak se hamane phone par baat kii
 He said that in 2009, about 200 adhoc teachers were made permanent
 inamen se kai das se 15 saal se collejon main padhaa rahe the
 Due to permanent, salary increased but the previous dues were not received
 edock kii jagah ab sahaayak shikshak rakhe jane lage hai
 His salary is also fixed, will not increase every year
 sahaayak shikshak kii selary 40,000 kar di gai
 We do not have information on the number of students and teachers in colleges in Gujarat
 agar ye jaankaree hoti to kis college main kitne chaatr hai, kitne shikshak hai to tasviir or saaf hoti
 It is written by talking to three teachers, if something is wrong, the education minister can give a statement, we will definitely show it
 is bich shiksha ke kshetra main rajasthan sarkaar ne ek bada krantikari kadam uthaaya he
 The students may remain zero in studies but do not lag behind in patriotism, so that the Rajasthan government has issued a decree to sing the national anthem every day in 800 hostels
 subah 7 baje raashtragan hoga
 You saw in the University Series that there is a terrible shortage of teachers in the college of Rajasthan
 raashtragan ke baad hostel se chaatr jab class main pahunchenge or shikshak nahin milenge tab ve kya karenge, mere khyaal se jab bhi kisi class ke liye teacher na hon us class main bhi raashtragan hona chahie
 Students can be diverted by the slogan of the type that is the teacher
 ndtv
 You can see a link to the entire university series on the site of in
 tippaniyan This picture is of those teachers and students who have come to Mumbai for 500 km to hold a press conference
 taaki vahaan baithi sarkaar unhen dekh le yaa vahaan kaa media unki baat ko sarkaar tak pahunchaa sake
 All of them are students and teachers of the Konkan region
 konkan main 103 college hai jo mumbai uniwarsity se jude hai
 They demand that there should be a separate university for Konkan, given the distance of 500 km, this demand also seems reasonable
 chote-chote kaam ke liye chaatro or shikshakon ko 500 kimi kii yatra kerani padati he
 Our colleague Sohit Mishra is continuously reporting about the disturbances in the examination of Mumbai University
 vahaan copy jaanchane ke liye ek privet company ko theka diya gaya tha
 Sohit is told by an RTI activist that changes were made to the rules for that company
 company kahati he ki niyamon kaa paalan hua, sohit ne shiksha mantri se jawaab maanga to jawaab dene se inkaar kar diya

 inamen se kai das se 15 saal se collejon main padhaa rahe the
 Due to permanent, salary increased but the previous dues were not received
 edock kii jagah ab sahaayak shikshak rakhe jane lage hai
 His salary is also fixed, will not increase every year
 sahaayak shikshak kii selary 40,000 kar di gai
 We do not have information on the number of students and teachers in colleges in Gujarat
 agar ye jaankaree hoti to kis college main kitne chaatr hai, kitne shikshak hai to tasviir or saaf hoti
 It is written by talking to three teachers, if something is wrong, the education minister can give a statement, we will definitely show it
 is bich shiksha ke kshetra main rajasthan sarkaar ne ek bada krantikari kadam uthaaya he
 The students may remain zero in studies but do not lag behind in patriotism, so that the Rajasthan government has issued a decree to sing the national anthem every day in 800 hostels
 subah 7 baje raashtragan hoga
 You saw in the University Series that there is a terrible shortage of teachers in the college of Rajasthan
 raashtragan ke baad hostel se chaatr jab class main pahunchenge or shikshak nahin milenge tab ve kya karenge, mere khyaal se jab bhi kisi class ke liye teacher na hon us class main bhi raashtragan hona chahie
 Students can be diverted by the slogan of the type that is the teacher
 ndtv
 You can see a link to the entire university series on the site of in
 tippaniyan This picture is of those teachers and students who have come to Mumbai for 500 km to hold a press conference
 taaki vahaan baithi sarkaar unhen dekh le yaa vahaan kaa media unki baat ko sarkaar tak pahunchaa sake
 All of them are students and teachers of the Konkan region
 konkan main 103 college hai jo mumbai uniwarsity se jude hai
 They demand that there should be a separate university for Konkan, given the distance of 500 km, this demand also seems reasonable
 chote-chote kaam ke liye chaatro or shikshakon ko 500 kimi kii yatra kerani padati he
 Our colleague Sohit Mishra is continuously reporting about the disturbances in the examination of Mumbai University
 vahaan copy jaanchane ke liye ek privet company ko theka diya gaya tha
 Sohit is told by an RTI activist that changes were made to the rules for that company
 company kahati he ki niyamon kaa paalan hua, sohit ne shiksha mantri se jawaab maanga to jawaab dene se inkaar kar diya
 This partnership of India and America was so successful that it created 31 other agricultural universities across the country
 iske chaatr krishi ke kshetra main duniya bhar main chhaae hue hai
 When Clinton was president in the US, his agriculture ministry deputy secretary Islam Siddiqui was a student of this university
 uniwarsity kaa campus itnaa bada he ki iske bheetar sadakon kaa jaal he, colony he, aspataal he, bazaar he, 6 primary skool hai, 3 secondary skool hai
 You will find this university in Udham Singh Nagar of Uttarakhand
 uniwarsity kii website par likhaa he ki yahaan 763 shikshak hai, iske alaava 59 technical staff hai or baaki sab milakar 2878 karmchaaree hai
 2800–3000 students study here
 ek shikshak par 6 chaatro kaa ausat he
 We were shocked that just six students on one teacher
 bharat kii kisi bhi uniwarsity main yah anupaat shaayad hi mili
 You have seen in the university series that in many places there is a ratio of 500 to 1200 students on one teacher
 hamaare sahyogi dinesh mansera ne jo report bheji he ham vah bhi dekh lete hai
 According to Dinesh, 4500 students study here whereas on the website it is written that 2800 to 3000 are read
 shikshak sangh ke adhyaksh ne jo shikshakon kii sankhya bataai he wo website par di gai usase kaaphi alag he
 Yes, there have been vacancies of about two hundred teachers for many years
 dhai hazaar se zyaada karmchaariyon ke pad khaali hai
 These include lab staff, staff, other assistant positions
 kai pad to yahaan bees-bees saal se khaali bataae gaye hai
 With which dream was this university built in 1959 and in 2017 you are seeing the ruins of this dream
 ye baat aap kisi netaa ke bhaashan main nahin sunenge
 Speeches are also strange
 lakhon karodon rupee karch kar reliyaan yojit kii jaati hai taaki koi netaa khud ko garib bataa sake
 What can be more ironic than this
 pant nagar uniwarsity main 14 shodh college chalate hai
 Its research institutes are spread across 9 districts
 magar yahaan ke hostalon main ganda pani aata he, shauchalay toote phute hai, sillen bhari deevaaren hai or karaab khaane kii shikaayat to aam baat he
 One more thing came to know that there is a lunch time of one o'clock to three o'clock, during which many works are stopped
 chaatro kii haalat yah he ki ve fasebuk par hi india kii demokrasi celibratt kar rahe hai, camere par aakar apni uniwarsity kii haalat par ek line nahin bol sakate kyonki ham sabane sweekaar kar liya he ki bol dene se skool college se naam cat jayega yaa netaa jail bhijwa degaa
 There is no student union in such a large university
 hakeekat maaloom he magar kehete samay use itnaa halkaa kar do ki baat bhi ho jaae or lage bhi na ki baat kii gai he
 The Vice Chancellor himself is saying that we do not stay anywhere
 sabaki jubaan par ranking aa gai he
 This is the new Shiguafa to dodge
 jaldi hi zile ke collejon kii rekking hone lagegi or usee main log khush rahenge
 The same thing happened with Miss World, Miss Nainital and Miss Rohtak have also started happening
 dinesh mansera ne bataaya he ki pichley saat saal se koi sthaayee vaais chancelar nahin rahaa
 This is the situation of the world school from which research is to be conducted on agriculture, experts are born for farming
 slogan se hi aamadani dugani ho jaaegi lagata he
 The employees union is also worried about the pension
 30-30 saal se pension kaa hissaa katwate rahe or use paane ke liye ladate phir rahe hai
 The government says that we have given our share and now the university has raised the remaining funds itself
 yahi nahin 2002 main uttarakhand sarkaar ne pant nagar uniwarsity krishi form kii 3339 acre zamin lekar vahaan audyogic kshetra bana daalaa
 Sources told Dinesh Mansera that neither the Agriculture Minister of the Manmohan Singh Government nor the Agriculture Minister of the Modi Government have stepped here
 uniwarsity series main ham gujarat yaa kai anya rajya cover nahin kar paae
 Due to resource constraints
 haal hi main rahul gandhi ne apane toun haul main ek professor ranjana avasthi ko gale laga liya
 There is a video of the Congress, not ours, first you hear what Sanskrit professor Ranjana Awasthi is saying
 koshish kii he ki hamaare saath alag se baat ho jaae magar safalataa nahin mili, dar ne logon kii aisi haalat kar di he
 Ranjana Awasthi's salary was 12000 after teaching Sanskrit for 22 years at NB Patel College, Ahmedabad
 kya aap duniya ke kisi bhi uniwarsity main koi ek naukari bataa sakate hai jahaan 22 saal kaam karne ke baad professor kii tankhwaah 12000 hoti he
 This example is not only from Gujarat, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh to Delhi University
 sochie 22 saal kii naukari ke baad tankhwaah 12000
 Even after this exploitation, emotional issues continue in our politics
 jaise dilli uniwarsity main edock hota he, madhya pradesh main guest teacher ko atithi vidwaan kehete hai usee tarah gujarat main asthai naukariyon ke liye samay samay par nai shabdaawalee kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 After talking to the teachers there, two types of permutations were found
 phul time permanent or part time permanent
 i heard Part Time Permanent for the first time
 blendar mistek, ritern back jaisaa lagata he part time permanent
 Part time is written in the appointment letter, but while teaching part time in the same college, they start calling themselves part time permanent
 ye sab udhaaharan bataate hai ki agar sarkaar chaahe to logon se bina paise hi zindagi bhar kaam kara sakati he or log kaam bhi kar lenge
 We talked to Shah of Dinesh, Dinesh Bhai continued to teach as part time permanent teacher for 35 years
 ek hi college main 1980 se 2015 tak part time padhaate rahe
 i joined a salary of 2500 in 1980
 2015 main ritair hue to selary hui 12000
 Dinesh Bhai taught law in the same college
 35 saal baad dinesh bhai college se nikle to unke haath main kuch nahin tha
 Neither pension nor any social security
 gujarat main 1998 main part time or edock niyuktiyon par roak laga di
 300 part time teachers have survived
 ye sabhi bees-bees saal se padhaa rahe hai
 Six months ago, it has been decided that those who have phd will get 40,000 salary but neither will get the arrears nor any other facility
 gujarat main edock padhaa rahe ek shikshak se hamane phone par baat kii
 He said that in 2009, about 200 adhoc teachers were made permanent

 It has written on the university website that there are 763 teachers, besides 59 technical staff and the rest are 2878 employees
 2800-3000 chaatr yahaan padhate hai
 a teacher has an average of 6 students
 ham chaunk gaye ki ek shikshak par sirf chah chaatr
 This ratio is rarely found in any university in India
 uniwarsity series main aapane dekha hi ki kai jagahon par ek shikshak par 500 se 1200 chaatro kaa anupaat he
 We also see the report sent by our colleague Dinesh Mansera
 dinesh ke mutabik yahaan 4500 chaatr padhate hai jabaki website par likhaa he ki 2800 se 3000 padhate hai
 The number of teachers that the teacher union president has told is quite different from that given on the website
 haa kai saal se kareeb dau sau shikshakon ke pad khaali hai
 More than two and a half thousand employees have vacancies
 inamen lab karmchaaree, staff, duusare sahaayak pad shaamil hai
 Many posts have been said to be empty here for twenty years
 1959 main kis sapane se is vishvavidhyalay ko banaaya gaya or 2017 main aap is sapane kaa khandhar dekh rahe hai
 You will not hear this in any leader's speech
 bhaashanon kaa bhi ajeeb haal he
 Rallies are organized by spending millions of crores of rupees so that a leader can describe himself as poor
 isse badi vidambnaa kya ho sakati he
 Pant Nagar University has 14 research colleges
 9 zilon main iske iske shodh santhaan faile hue hai
 But there is dirty water in the hostels here, toilets are broken, walls are damp and complaints of bad food are common
 ek or baat pataa chali ki ek baje se teen baje kaa lunch time hota he is dauraan kai kaam band ho jate hai
 The condition of the students is that they are celebrating the democracy of India on Facebook, cannot come on camera and speak a line on the condition of their university because we all have accepted that the name will be cut from the school college by speaking or the leader Will send prison itani badi uniwarsity main chaatr sangh nahin he
 The reality is known, but when you say it, make it so light that it should be talked about and not even talked about
 vaais chancelar sahab khud hi kah rahe hai ki ham kahin nahin thaharte
 Everyone's tongue has been ranked
 chakma dene kaa yah nayaa shigupha he
 Soon the colleges of the district will start ranking and people will be happy in that
 miss world ke saath yahi hua tha, miss nainital or miss rohtak bhi hone laga he
 Dinesh Mansera has stated that there has been no permanent Vice Chancellor for the last seven years
 jis vishwa vidlaalay se kheti par shodh hona he, kheti ke liye visheshgy paidaa hone hai uskaa ye haal he
 The income from the slogan itself will double
 karmchaaree sangh pension ko lekar bhi pareshaan he
 For 30-30 years, part of the pension has been deducted and has been fighting to get it
 sarkaar kahati he ki hamane apana hissaa de diya he or ab uniwarsity baaki fund khud jutaaye
 Not only this, in 2002, the Uttarakhand government took 3339 acres of land of Pant Nagar University Agricultural Form and made it an industrial area
 dinesh mansera ko sutron ne bataaya ki yahaan to manmohan singh sarkaar ke krishi mantri or na hi modi sarkaar ke krishi mantri ne kadam rakhaa he
 We could not cover Gujarat or many other states in the University Series
 sansaadhan kii kami ke kaaran
 Recently Rahul Gandhi hugged a professor Ranjana Awasthi in his town hall
 congress kaa video he, hamaara nahin he, pehle aap suniye sanskrit kii professor ranjana avasthi kya kah rahi hai
 Have tried to talk separately with us but did not get success, fear has made people in such a condition
 ahmedabad ke enbi patel college main 22 saal tak sanskrit padhaane ke baad ranjana avasthi kii selary 12000 hui
 Can you tell me any one job in any university in the world where after 22 years of work, the salary of a professor is 12000
 yah udaahan sirf gujarat kaa nahin he, bihar, madhya pradesh se lekar dilli uniwarsity tak kaa he
 Think salary 12000 after 22 years of job
 is shoshan ke baad bhi hamaari raajnneeti main bhavuk mudde hi chalate hai
 Just like Adhawk happens in Delhi University, Guest Teacher in Madhya Pradesh is called Guest Scholar, similarly new term is used from time to time for temporary jobs in Gujarat
 vahaan ke shikshakon se baat karne par do tarah ke permanent kaa pataa chalaa
 Full time permanent and part time permanent
 maine pehali baar part time permanent suna he
 Blunder Mistake looks like a return back, part time permanent
 niyukti patr main part time hi likhaa hota he magar ek hi college main part time padhaate-padhaate ve khud ko part time permanent kehane lagate hai
 All these examples show that if the government wants, then people can get their work done without any money and people will do the work
 hamane dinesh ke shah se baat kii, dinesh bhai ne 35 saal tak part time permanent teacher ke taur par padhaate rahe
 He taught part time at the same college from 1980 to 2015
 1980 main 2500 kii selary par jwine kiya tha
 12000 when he retired in 2015
 dinesh bhai ne ek hi college main kanoon padhaayaa
 After 35 years, Dinesh Bhai came out of college and he had nothing in his hands
 na pension na koi saamaajik suraksha
 In 1998, part time and adhoc appointments were banned in Gujarat
 300 part time teacher batch gaye hai
 All of them have been teaching for twenty years
 chah maheenaa pehle faisla hua he ki jinaki piechdi he unhen 40,000 vetan milegaa magar pehle na bakaayaa milegaa na baaki koi suvidha
 We spoke on the phone to a teacher teaching Adhoc in Gujarat
 unhone bataaya ki 2009 main kareeb 200 edock shikshakon ko sthaayee kiya gaya tha
 Many of them were teaching in colleges for ten to 15 years
 sthaayee hone se selary to bad gai magar pichhlaa bakaayaa kuch nahin mila
 Adhoc teachers are now being replaced
 inaki selary bhi fiks he, har saal nahin badhegi
 The salary of assistant teacher was increased to 40,000
 hamaare paas gujarat ke collejon main chaatro or shikshakon kii sankhya kii jaankaree nahin he
 If this information were there, how many students are there in which college, how many teachers are there, then the picture would have been more clear
 teen shikshakon se baat kar likhaa he, agar kuch galat he to vahaan ke shiksha mantri bayaan de sakate hai, ham zarur dikhaaenge
 Meanwhile, the Rajasthan government has taken a major revolutionary step in the field of education
 chaatr padhai main bhale zero rah jaaen magar deshbhakti main peeche na rahe iske liye rajasthan sarkaar ne 800 hostel main har din raashtragan gane kaa farmaan jari kar diya he
 There will be a national anthem at 7 am
 aapane uniwarsity series main aapane dekha ki rajasthan ke college ke college main shikshakon kii bhayanak kami he
 After the national anthem, what will they do when the students from the hostel arrive in the class and do not get teachers, i think whenever there is no teacher for any class, that class should also have a national anthem
 chaatr hi shikshak he tip ke naare se bhi chaatro kaa dhyaan hataaya ja saktaa he
 ndtv
 in kii site par puri uniwarsity series kaa link he aap dekh sakate hai
 The comments yah tasviir un shikshakon or chaatro kii he jo 500 kilometre chalakar mumbai main press conference karne aae hai
 So that the government sitting there can see them or the media there can convey their point to the government
 ye sabhi konkan ilaake ke chaatr or shikshak hai
 There are 103 colleges in Konkan which are affiliated to Mumbai University
 inaki maang he ki konkan ke liye alag se vishvavidhyalay hona chahie, 500 kimi kii duuri dekhte hue yah maang uchit bhi lagati he
 Students and teachers have to travel 500 km for small tasks
 hamaare sahyogi sohit mishra lagaataar mumbai uniwarsity kii pariksha main hui gadabadi ko lekar report kar rahe hai
 a private company was contracted to check the copy there
 sohit ko artiai kaaryakarta ne bataaya he ki us company ke liye niyamon main badlaav kiye gaye

 Dinesh Bhai taught law in the same college

 Neither pension nor any social security

 300 part time teachers have survived

 Six months ago, it has been decided that those who have phd will get 40,000 salary but neither will get the arrears nor any other facility

 We do not have information on the number of students and teachers in colleges in Gujarat
 agar ye jaankaree hoti to kis college main kitne chaatr hai, kitne shikshak hai to tasviir or saaf hoti
 It is written by talking to three teachers, if something is wrong, the education minister can give a statement, we will definitely show it
 is bich shiksha ke kshetra main rajasthan sarkaar ne ek bada krantikari kadam uthaaya he
 The students may remain zero in studies but do not lag behind in patriotism, so that the Rajasthan government has issued a decree to sing the national anthem every day in 800 hostels
 subah 7 baje raashtragan hoga
 You saw in the University Series that there is a terrible shortage of teachers in the college of Rajasthan
 raashtragan ke baad hostel se chaatr jab class main pahunchenge or shikshak nahin milenge tab ve kya karenge, mere khyaal se jab bhi kisi class ke liye teacher na hon us class main bhi raashtragan hona chahie
 Students can be diverted by the slogan of the type that is the teacher
 ndtv
 You can see a link to the entire university series on the site of in
 tippaniyan This picture is of those teachers and students who have come to Mumbai for 500 km to hold a press conference
 taaki vahaan baithi sarkaar unhen dekh le yaa vahaan kaa media unki baat ko sarkaar tak pahunchaa sake
 All of them are students and teachers of the Konkan region
 konkan main 103 college hai jo mumbai uniwarsity se jude hai
 They demand that there should be a separate university for Konkan, given the distance of 500 km, this demand also seems reasonable
 chote-chote kaam ke liye chaatro or shikshakon ko 500 kimi kii yatra kerani padati he
 Our colleague Sohit Mishra is continuously reporting about the disturbances in the examination of Mumbai University
 vahaan copy jaanchane ke liye ek privet company ko theka diya gaya tha
 Sohit is told by an RTI activist that changes were made to the rules for that company
 company kahati he ki niyamon kaa paalan hua, sohit ne shiksha mantri se jawaab maanga to jawaab dene se inkaar kar diya
 Not only this, in 2002, the Uttarakhand government took 3339 acres of land of Pant Nagar University Agricultural Form and made it an industrial area
 dinesh mansera ko sutron ne bataaya ki yahaan to manmohan singh sarkaar ke krishi mantri or na hi modi sarkaar ke krishi mantri ne kadam rakhaa he
 We could not cover Gujarat or many other states in the University Series
 sansaadhan kii kami ke kaaran
 Recently Rahul Gandhi hugged a professor Ranjana Awasthi in his town hall
 congress kaa video he, hamaara nahin he, pehle aap suniye sanskrit kii professor ranjana avasthi kya kah rahi hai
 Have tried to talk separately with us but did not get success, fear has made people in such a condition
 ahmedabad ke enbi patel college main 22 saal tak sanskrit padhaane ke baad ranjana avasthi kii selary 12000 hui
 Can you tell me any one job in any university in the world where after 22 years of work, the salary of a professor is 12000
 yah udaahan sirf gujarat kaa nahin he, bihar, madhya pradesh se lekar dilli uniwarsity tak kaa he
 Think salary 12000 after 22 years of job
 is shoshan ke baad bhi hamaari raajnneeti main bhavuk mudde hi chalate hai
 Just like Adhawk happens in Delhi University, Guest Teacher in Madhya Pradesh is called Guest Scholar, similarly new term is used from time to time for temporary jobs in Gujarat
 vahaan ke shikshakon se baat karne par do tarah ke permanent kaa pataa chalaa
 Full time permanent and part time permanent
 maine pehali baar part time permanent suna he
 Blunder Mistake looks like a return back, part time permanent
 niyukti patr main part time hi likhaa hota he magar ek hi college main part time padhaate-padhaate ve khud ko part time permanent kehane lagate hai
 All these examples show that if the government wants, then people can get their work done without any money and people will do the work
 hamane dinesh ke shah se baat kii, dinesh bhai ne 35 saal tak part time permanent teacher ke taur par padhaate rahe
 He taught part time at the same college from 1980 to 2015
 1980 main 2500 kii selary par jwine kiya tha
 12000 when he retired in 2015
 dinesh bhai ne ek hi college main kanoon padhaayaa
 After 35 years, Dinesh Bhai came out of college and he had nothing in his hands
 na pension na koi saamaajik suraksha
 In 1998, part time and adhoc appointments were banned in Gujarat
 300 part time teacher batch gaye hai
 All of them have been teaching for twenty years
 chah maheenaa pehle faisla hua he ki jinaki piechdi he unhen 40,000 vetan milegaa magar pehle na bakaayaa milegaa na baaki koi suvidha
 We spoke on the phone to a teacher teaching Adhoc in Gujarat
 unhone bataaya ki 2009 main kareeb 200 edock shikshakon ko sthaayee kiya gaya tha
 Many of them were teaching in colleges for ten to 15 years
 sthaayee hone se selary to bad gai magar pichhlaa bakaayaa kuch nahin mila
 Adhoc teachers are now being replaced
 inaki selary bhi fiks he, har saal nahin badhegi
 The salary of assistant teacher was increased to 40,000
 hamaare paas gujarat ke collejon main chaatro or shikshakon kii sankhya kii jaankaree nahin he
 If this information were there, how many students are there in which college, how many teachers are there, then the picture would have been more clear
 teen shikshakon se baat kar likhaa he, agar kuch galat he to vahaan ke shiksha mantri bayaan de sakate hai, ham zarur dikhaaenge
 Meanwhile, the Rajasthan government has taken a major revolutionary step in the field of education
 chaatr padhai main bhale zero rah jaaen magar deshbhakti main peeche na rahe iske liye rajasthan sarkaar ne 800 hostel main har din raashtragan gane kaa farmaan jari kar diya he
 There will be a national anthem at 7 am
 aapane uniwarsity series main aapane dekha ki rajasthan ke college ke college main shikshakon kii bhayanak kami he
 After the national anthem, what will they do when the students from the hostel arrive in the class and do not get teachers, i think whenever there is no teacher for any class, that class should also have a national anthem
 chaatr hi shikshak he tip ke naare se bhi chaatro kaa dhyaan hataaya ja saktaa he
 ndtv
 in kii site par puri uniwarsity series kaa link he aap dekh sakate hai
 The comments yah tasviir un shikshakon or chaatro kii he jo 500 kilometre chalakar mumbai main press conference karne aae hai
 So that the government sitting there can see them or the media there can convey their point to the government
 ye sabhi konkan ilaake ke chaatr or shikshak hai
 There are 103 colleges in Konkan which are affiliated to Mumbai University
 inaki maang he ki konkan ke liye alag se vishvavidhyalay hona chahie, 500 kimi kii duuri dekhte hue yah maang uchit bhi lagati he
 Students and teachers have to travel 500 km for small tasks
 hamaare sahyogi sohit mishra lagaataar mumbai uniwarsity kii pariksha main hui gadabadi ko lekar report kar rahe hai
 a private company was contracted to check the copy there
 sohit ko artiai kaaryakarta ne bataaya he ki us company ke liye niyamon main badlaav kiye gaye
 The company says that the rules were followed, Sohit asked the Education Minister for an answer, but refused to answer
 uniwarsity series main ham gujarat yaa kai anya rajya cover nahin kar paae
 Due to resource constraints
 haal hi main rahul gandhi ne apane toun haul main ek professor ranjana avasthi ko gale laga liya
 There is a video of the Congress, not ours, first you hear what Sanskrit professor Ranjana Awasthi is saying
 koshish kii he ki hamaare saath alag se baat ho jaae magar safalataa nahin mili, dar ne logon kii aisi haalat kar di he
 Ranjana Awasthi's salary was 12000 after teaching Sanskrit for 22 years at NB Patel College, Ahmedabad
 kya aap duniya ke kisi bhi uniwarsity main koi ek naukari bataa sakate hai jahaan 22 saal kaam karne ke baad professor kii tankhwaah 12000 hoti he
 This example is not only from Gujarat, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh to Delhi University
 sochie 22 saal kii naukari ke baad tankhwaah 12000
 Even after this exploitation, emotional issues continue in our politics
 jaise dilli uniwarsity main edock hota he, madhya pradesh main guest teacher ko atithi vidwaan kehete hai usee tarah gujarat main asthai naukariyon ke liye samay samay par nai shabdaawalee kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 After talking to the teachers there, two types of permutations were found
 phul time permanent or part time permanent
 i heard Part Time Permanent for the first time
 blendar mistek, ritern back jaisaa lagata he part time permanent
 Part time is written in the appointment letter, but while teaching part time in the same college, they start calling themselves part time permanent

 farah khan ne kaha ki main sachmuch khush hum ki rithik ne aisa kiya he, mujhe lagata he ki ab wo samay aa gaya tha jab is mudde par baat kerani chahie

 For the last few days, there has been speculation that the Central Government may abolish Article 35-A
 soshal media se lekar har jagah is par charchaa he
 Mehbooba Mufti and Omar Abdullah are asking to avoid tampering in 35A
 in das binduon main aap acchhee tarah se samaj sakate hai ki aakhir ye ARTICLE 35 a he kya
 1
 ARTICLE 35 a desh kii aazaadee ke 7 saal baad yani 1954 main samvidhan main joda gaya tha
 These paragraphs were on the recommendation of the Nehru cabinet by the then President Dr
 rajendra prasad ke ek aadesh se samvidhan main joda gaya tha
 2
 ARTICLE 35 a kaa iklauta aadhaar wo qaraar he jo 1952 main pradhanmantri jawahar laal nehru or jammu-kashmir ke tatkaaleen pradhanmantri shaikh abdulla ke bich hua tha
 It is also called Delhi Agreement
 3
 In this agreement, the matter of Indian citizenship has been considered as the subject of the state in the context of Jammu and Kashmir
 isliye isamen kashmiriyon ko kuch vishesh adhikaar milte hai
 There are also rules for them in this
 4
 ARTICLE 35 a provides these privileges in relation to jobs, property purchase, inheritance, scholarship, government assistance and facilities related to welfare schemes
 5
 ARTICLE 35 a Added to the Constitution by Presidential Order: These orders of the President were issued under Article 370 (1) (d) of the Constitution
 ye praavdhaan raashtrapati ko jammu-kashmir ke maamle main rajya ke vishay par samvidhan main jarurat par badlaav or chhot dene kaa adhikaar detaa he
 6
 ARTICLE 35 a se judi khaas baat ye he ki ise banaate samay sansadeey pranali se kanoon banane kii prakriya kii jagah raashtrapati ke aadesh ke jariye ise samvidhan main joda gaya
 Whereas Article 368 (i) of the Constitution gives the right to any amendment to the Constitution only to the Parliament
 7
 From ARTICLE 35 A, the government of the state of Jammu and Kashmir considers those who settled in Jammu and Kashmir before 14 May 1954
 inhen nivaasiyon ko jammu and kashmir main jameen kharidne, sarkari naukariyon or sarkari yojanaon main laabh miltaa he
 8
 ARTICLE 35 a ye bhi tay karata he ki kisi duusare rajya kaa nivasee jammu-kashmir main sthaayee nivasee ke taur par yahaan apana nivas nahin bana saktaa
 Not only this, residents of another state also cannot buy land in Kashmir
 9
 ARTICLE 35 a also sets separate rules regarding marriage
 niyam ke mutabik yadi jammu-kashmir kii koi mahila bharat ke kisi anya rajya ke vyakti se shaadi karti he to uske adhikaar chhin jate hai, vaise purushon ke maamle main ye niyam alag hai

 In the destiny of the people of Kusheshwarsthan of mythological importance in Darbhanga district, which has been surrounded by water logging for about eight months in a year, God has written the flood permanently
 prasiddh kusheshwar mahadev mandir ke kaaran mithilanchal kaa baidyanathdham kahalaane vaale kusheshwarasthaan ke logon ne ab apni bhugolic kismat ko sweekaar kar liya he or chaaron ore jamaa pani ke kaaran choti naukaaen yahaan ke logon ke jivan kaa abhinn hissaa ban gayi hai
 This is the reason that in marriage, bridesmaids ask for a boat as an omen in dowry

 In the absence of a paved road capable of transport throughout the year, the local people have made use of boats and bridges made of bamboo and wood chachis to support traffic

 60-year-old Ramamurth, a resident of Dinoma, says that if people do not see a good future in this waterlogged area, then they migrate to big cities for livelihood
 saal bhar main adhiktam samay pani main duube hone ke kaaran urvar bhoomi bhi nasht ho jaati he
 Therefore fishing and makhana farming in water logging areas are major income sources of income but no processing facilities

 But the common man has to suffer in the same way as a driver without having to travel to big cities

 After the filing of the CBI charge sheet last week, the deteriorating relationship of mother and daughter has also come to light
 chargeshit ke mutabik indrani hameshaa hi shina ko naapsand nahin karti thi
 There was a time when Indrani trusted Sheena
 saal 2003 main dilli ke jis flats ko indrani ne vidhi ke naam kiya tha indrani or peter kii maut ke baad indrani kii maa durga rani or shina ko uskaa aisecuter banaaya
 The comments indrani or shina ke rishton main daraar tab aayi jab shina or rahul ke rishte majboot hue
 Indrani was against this relationship
 iske chalate inke rishte main kadavaahat is kadar bad gayi kii indrani ne apni vasiyat badal kar shina ko hataa diya
 It is clear from the cbi's charge sheet that Sheena and Indrani's relationship deteriorated due to Rahul's closeness to Sheena
 shina ne indrani ko jo i-mail likhe jinka zikr chargeshit main kiya gaya he usase bhi is baat kii pushti hoti he
 Three years later, the truth of Sheena's murder came to light, from the same day speculations began to be made about the relationship between Sheena and Indrani
 pichley hafte sibiai kii chargeshit daakhil hone ke baad maa beti ke banate bigadate rishte bhi saamne aaye hai
 According to the chargesheet, Indrani did not always dislike Sheena
 ek vaqt tha jab indrani shina par bharosa karti thi
 In 2003, after the death of Indrani and Peter, the flat in Delhi which Indrani had named as law, Indrani's mother Durga Rani and Sheena were made her computers
 tippaniyan The rift in Indrani and Sheena's relationship came when Sheena and Rahul's relationship strengthened
 indrani is rishte ke khilaaf thi
 Due to this, the bitterness in their relationship increased so much that Indrani changed her will and removed Sheena
 sibiai kii chargeshit se yah saafe hota he ki shina or indrani ke rishte shina se rahul kii nazdikiyon ke chalate karaab hue
 The e-mails that Sheena wrote to Indrani which are mentioned in the charge sheet also confirm this

 Two DBC personnel working in the Office of Malaria Inspector of Karkardooma, Delhi are in the grip of Chikungunya
 purvi dilli main ek malaria inspector chikangunia se jujh kar aae hai
 Inspector says that his body still aches while working
 iske alaava kai karmchaaree bukhaar main apni duty karte hue najar aate hai
 You would be surprised to know that these mosquito breeding checkers leave for duty without any rescue
 karmi kehete hai ki bachaav ke liye wo sab puri baaju ke kapade to pahan lete hai, lekin iske baavjood machhar ne kaat sake isliye machhar maarane vaale chemical ko hi vah haathon or gale main laga lete hai
 At the same time, the heat of the fogging machine burns the hands of many workers
 rojaanaa fwking karne ke liye nikalne vaale kai karmchaaree phaging mashin kii garmi se apane haath jala baithte hai karmchaaree kehete hai ki yah foging mashine kuch is tarah kii he ki agar inhen lagaataar aadhe ghante se zyada chalaa diya jaae to mashin aag phenkane lagati he
 In this situation, while fogging, the machine becomes very hot at times, due to which many employees have got scorched hands
 sabhi karmiyon kii chhuttiyaan nirastadilli nagar nigam ke malaria nirikshan or rokthaam se jude karmiyon kii chhuttiyaan nirast kar di gai he, sabhi karmiyon ko sakht hidaayat di gai he ki gambhir maamalon ke alaava kisi ko chhuttiyaan nahin di jaaengi
 This is the reason that many workers are also doing duty in fever

 Taking a strong stand against corruption, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said that no one involved in the 2-G spectrum scam and irregularities in the Commonwealth Games will be spared and the law will do its job
 singh ne yah bhi kaha ki saarvajanik jivan ko saaf-suthra karne ke liye sarkaar harsambhav prayaas karegi

 i believe that it would be appropriate for us to continue on the same path we have been following since 2007 to provide an environment of equal competition
