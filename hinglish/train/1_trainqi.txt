 vahaan aap jaao to dekhte hai ki alpsankhyak behatar tareeke se rah rahe hai
 i do not understand why the opposition is unable to understand the agenda of this bill
 mandal kii is baat kaa virodh karte hue bijepi netaa chandra bose ne kaha ki bharat koi dharmashala nahin he
 We cannot welcome people from countries all over the world who have been tortured in their own country
 ham unki madad karnaa chaahate hai jo log un teen deshon main pratadit kiye gaye
 Bose further stated that this Citizenship Amendment Bill is not final
 is par charchaa ho rahi he, isamen amendament kiye jaaenge
 On this reply of BJP leader Bose, Mandal asked if this is not final, then why is this bill being introduced in Parliament
 jab aap assam ke 3 karod logon ko nahin sambhaal paae to puure desh ke 130 karod logon ko kaise sambhaal paaenge
 The novel feels the need to cite Dibakar Banerjee's popular film LSD with its sub-title (love Sex and Deception Story in Recession Days), but with an interesting and enduring narrative like a traditional aiyar-katha
 Apart from this, this novel is a multi-structural semantic account of the serious information of our time
 ek ke upar ek, kai-kai paraton ko satarkta lekin pravaah se bithakar, aisi imaarat kii rachana, jo maujuuda yatharth kaa kathatmak time-line banati he
 Many may be confused with the title that it will be a novel written in a simple story line, keeping the life of a character at the center like the Hindi novels
 lekin yah upanyaas hindi ke upanyaason kii maanya avadharanaon se apane rachanaatmak saahas ke saath, jokhim bhari duuri, tatasthta or nissangata baratate hue apane bahari paath main kisi ‘krime beet’ kii dainik report kaa vinyas rachataa he
 It abrogates the greed to become the epicenter of the middle class, shrinking the lives of the major and some 'central' characters
 yah ham sab tak har roj pahunchati soochnaaon kaa dilkash par maarmik calidoscope he, jiske katha-sutara apni achaanak-apratyaashit upasthiti se har baar aisa kissa bunane lagate hai, jo ant main aaj kii, yani 1990 ke baad kii badalati hui mega-metro centric jindagiyon kaa gambhir aakhyaan ban jaataa he
 While reading this, sometimes we remember the poison of the man of Srilal Shukla, sometimes the dead house of Jagadamba Prasad Dixit, sometimes the airs of Gopal Ram Gahmari and Devkinandan Khatri
 kabhi to yah bhi lagata he ki jaise ibne safi hindi sahitya ke upanyaaskaar ban gaye hon
 Those readers and critics who read the broker's wife, from the shadows or surface of the architecture's exterior structure of these scattered stories, from the eyes of their old text-system, will initially have a lot of dilemma
 yah ‘pulp’ he yaa ‘sahitya’? ravi bule kaa taaja upanyaas pulp hota sahitya he? yaa ‘sahitya’ hota pulp? yah uljhan shuru main mujhe bhi hui, lekin yah upanyaas ‘an-putdouneble’ he
 That is, once you start studying it, then you cannot leave it
 yah upanyaas kisi bollywood film kii out-line script bhi ho sakati he, lekin mumbai kii gater kii jindagi dikhaane vaali satya jaisi anginat filmein nahin, haashie ke baahar jite manushyon ke jivan kii gambhir soochnaaon se bhari kisi manikhej thriller jaisi yathartwaadee samanaantar film
 One novel after another and then third, and so on, this novel, while unraveling the many strands of information, news, news, one by one, layer by layer, opening a bundle of tangled threads Finally immerses the narratives in the manifest metropolitan reality of this period
 agar ‘aadhuniktaa’ kii clasik-academik vyakhya ko yaad karen, to yah aisa yatharth he, jisamen har vyakti thaga gaya he, or har vyakti duusare ko thag rahaa he
 It is a curious and restless anecdote between the brokers, criminals, murderers and traitors who are born and blown away and the tragic end of all human sensibilities
 mana jaataa he ki soochna-kranti ke baad, baahar kii khabaren or suchanaaen pahunchane vaale asankhya takneekee madhyamon ke saarvbhaumik makadzaal yaa ‘global-nexs’ ne ham sabake jivan ko kahaniyon se gher diya he
 This time is the unique absurd time of the siege of thousands of daily stories
 har roj subah ke akhbaar, tivi channels, internet or soshal netwarking cites jaise kisi badal ke fat jane se akut kahaniyon kii musaladhar barsaat kar rahe hai
 This time is a rushed absurd round of information and events, that is, news, information, phone calls, tweets and SMS become 'stories'
 or aise samay main, ek duusare se vicchhinn yaa alag-thalag lagati soochnaaon ko ekasutra main baandh kar koi kissa kahana yaa upanyaas likhnaa saral nahin rah gaya he
 The 'yukta' that Ravi has used to convert these scattered and disparate formulas into a novel is interesting
 in kathaon ko ek katha kii ek-sutarata main badalane vaala ‘sutaradhar’ billiyon kaa ek parivaar he
 a mother and four of her six
 unki aapasi baatcheet or fusfusaahat is upanyaas ko saakaar main badalati samanaantar upakatha he
 More importantly, it probably plays the role of a metaphor or an aligree, as we saw in the old folklore or theatrical
 dalal kii bivi kii billiyaan usee tarah paraspar samvaad main ‘mantranaaen’ karti prakat hoti hai, jaisaa puraane kathakavy main kagabhusundi, naarad, shiv-parvati aadi
 This is Ravi's interesting 'device
 koi bhi rachana, kala, sangeet yaa cinema apane ant ke baad apana arth vyakt karata he, to yah ravi kaa mahanagaron ke seemaant main jeene-marane vaali jindagiyon kii adamya jijeevishaa kaa upanyaas he
 It is not the epic of the middle class, but the poignant decadence of deprived life in contemporary Hindi fiction
 yah kahani ke liye nai jagahon, vishyon or sambhaavnaaon ke daravaaje kholta he

 Before 2009 i was not sure about my game, my ability
 is baat par shaq tha ki shuru main dhimaa khilne ke baad main baad main gend or ran kaa faasla kam kar sakuunga yaa nahin

 Now Pakistan needs some final treatment
 naa sirf grahamantri balki unke alaava bhi centre sarkaar ke anya mantri bhi lagaataar pakistan ko lekar bayaanbaji kar rahe hai

 Sushma had said that India should bring 10 heads of Pakistani Army personnel in exchange for one
 piem ne reliyon main kiya tha zikraus dauraan sushamaa ke is bayaan par bhi raajnneeti tej hui thi
 Even during the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the issue of beheading of Indian Army personnel had become an election issue
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne bhi reliyon main kaha tha ki pakistan hamaare javaanon ke sir kaat rahaa he or sarkaar pakistani piem ko chikan biryani khilaa rahe hai
 Scindia had also reminded the promise
during the winter session of Parliament, Congress leader Jyotiraditya Scindia had also targeted Sushma Swaraj on the same issue, asking the government to fulfill its promise
 loksabhaa main sindhiya ne kaha tha ki sarkaar baar-baar galati ko doharaa rahi he, seemaa par javaanon kii suraksha ke liye kuch nahin kiya ja rahaa he
 Why Prime Minister Narendra Modi is silent on this matter
 unhone kaha ki baar-baar seemaa paar se aatanki is taraf ghus rahe hai, centre sarkaar kya kar rahi he
 During this, Scindia said that those who used to talk earlier that we will bring ten heads instead of one, will give a befitting reply to Pakistan
 us vaade kaa kya hua, ab wo log chuppi saadh kar kyon baithe hue hai
 Now the question arises whether Modi government will take any strict action on Pakistan
 kya ab samay aa gaya he ki is baar sargical strike se bhi adhik kadaa kadam uthaakar pakistan kii bolti band kii jaae

 somvaar ko bihar ke mukhyamantri jithan ram maanjhi ne varisht police adhikariyon kaa tabadalaa kiya
 It has a police officer, Kundan Krishnan, IG, Patna, who has now been made the head of the ATS
 kundan ke tabadale ke peeche ye bataaya gaya he ki patna ke gandhi maidan haadase main saare varisht se lekar neeche ke adhikariyon ko jab hataaya gaya tab kundan kii raajnneetik pahunch kii vajah se hi us vakt unka tabadalaa nahin hua
 But, after the incident on Vijayadashami, i saw how Kundan was barricading with his subordinates from Gandhi Maidan to PMCH
 ghatana ke vakt unki vardi tak fat gai or jab sade kapade main piemasiech ke imargency get par bheed ko apane body guard kii madad se roke hue the, tab kai logon ne unke saath dhakka mukki tak kii
 Under normal circumstances, if you bang with the senior officer, the police immediately lathi-charge, but at that time the crowd control was to be done, not to charge the lathi
 baad main bagal ke ek kamare main kundan ne vardi manga ke kapade badale or imargency ward main jaruri dawa na hone par unhone teen hajaar rupee dekar dawa bhi mangaaye
 That evening SSP, DM, DIG, Commissioner of Police were all absent
 sab par karrwai hui lekin kundan to mustaid the
 However, the state government felt that not transferring them would give the wrong message
 lekin meraa maananaa he ki tabadale ke baad bihar main yaa yon kahen ki puure desh main shaayad hi koi adhikari bheed main apane kapade fadavaayega, paise dekar dawa mangaayegaa or logon kii gaali or maar khaakar logon kii jaan bachaane kii koshish karegaa
 i agree that Kundan Krishnan has not been a very popular officer, but what did Manjhi Sarkar do in return for the award for work that evening? 8 november ko piem modi dwaara in noton ko bain kar die jane ke baad in noton ko bainkon main jamaa karwaane kii miyaad 30 disambar thi

 dual camere ke baad ab trend bejal les disple vaale smartfones kaa he
 Vivo, a Chinese smartphone maker
 company ne kam bejal vaali disple ke saath apana flagship smartphone V7 Play launch kar diya he
 In this smartphone review, we will try to know whether this smartphone really meets the expectations or not
 sabase pehle baat karenge parformens keeis bajet ke smartfones main hai and procesar milte hai, lekin isamen qolkom kaa mid range procesar diya gaya he
 Multi tasking is easy
 ek ap se duusare ap main janaa bhi aasaan he
 But the difficulty is when you open many apps at once
 yahaan par yah smartphone thodaa peeche jarur he
 Because other smartphones in this segment are fine
 jaisaa hamane pehle bhi bataaya multi tasking aasaan he, yani agar aap Asphalt khel rahe hai or ise minimij karke koi doosraa ap yuj karnaa he to yah kaaphi aasaan he
 Like the previous smartphone of Build qualityvivo, it also has Build Quality Solid
 phone metal body kaa he, isliye premium lagata he
 The antenna lines are upwards and the antenna lines are not kept traditional but you will see a change here
 antena ke kinare par silver lining he or aapako shaayad yah pasand aayega
 Apart from this, its body is curved from the back and its edges are sharp
 camera bamp bhi he jiske thik bagal main dual elidi flash he
 This time, the company has decided not to give the fingerprint scanner in the front but back
 yahaan clic karen or padhein is smartphone kii puri spacificationsdusare smartphone main fingerprint scinar round hote hai, lekin isamen yah chaukor he
 Let me tell you a fact, Vivo is the first company to introduce fingerprint scanner technology inside the display
 ummid thi wo technology isamen dekhne ko milegi, lekin aisa nahin he
 The volume locker and lock are on the same side and are not as solid as they should be
 aap yuj karenge to shaayad aapako yah pasand na aae
 Because volume locker and lock key are used the most
 mat blike vairient prabhavit karata he or yah behtareen lagata he
 The absence of USB Type c is a bit strange
 isamen micro yuasabi conector diya gaya he
 Since other companies are now offering USB Type c connector in this segment, you will definitely miss its shortfall
 displeis smartphone kii khaasiyat isaki disple he
 The company has made every effort to keep the bezel to a minimum
 ise istemaal karte hue aap feel karenge kii kaaphi badi he
 The display looks bigger than the phone, because it does not have bezels
 disple brit he or dhoop main aap ise aaraam se yuj kar sakate hai koi pareshaani nahin hogi
 However, the screen will feel slightly scratched
 chunki screen kii lambaai bejal kam hone kii vajah se zyada he isliye aap istemaal karenge to lagegaa kii screen stretch kii hui he
 The resolution of the screen is full HD and screen 2
 5D karvd he jisase yuj karnaa aasaan ho jaataa he
 In terms of this segment, its bezelless display can be called effective
 kyonki bazaar main bina bejal disple vaale smartfones kam hai or zyaadaatar mahange hai
 Camera: This smartphone is a bezel lace, as well as a selfie centric device
 selfi ke liye isamen 24 megapixl kaa front camera diya gaya he
 The trend has changed
 At one time companies did not provide 24 megapixel camera even in the rear of their smartphone
 yah shaayad bhartiya bazaar kaa pehla smartphone he jiske front main 24 megapixl kaa selfi camera diya gaya he
 The camera interface is similar to Vivo's other smartphones
 hamane iske alag alag mod yuj kiye hai
 It also has a beautification mode that does not affect
 haalanki normal mod par selfi badhiya aati he
 This smartphone has a good feature for group selfie
 selfi ke liye bhi isamen panaroma mod diya gaya he
 That is, you can take a group selfie by moving the camera
 group main chaahe kitne log kyon na hon is mod ke jariye sabhi logon kii selfi clic kii ja sakati he
 In batterymixed use, you can run it one day, but if you are a power user
 yani gaming karte hai or puure din photography ye selfi lete hai to bydaree jald khatm hogi or ek din bhi nahin chalegi
 Overall, except for its display, design, build quality and selfie camera, there are not many things to impress
 upar se isaki keemat thodi zyada jarur lagati he
 If you are a selfie lover and watch videos and films on mobile, then it may prove to be better for you

 South Dilil Mayor Kamaljeet Sehrawat termed the Delhi government's order to immediately regularize daily wage earners as clean workers
 unhone kaha he ki dilli sarkaar ne aadesh to jari kar diya lekin ise puraa karne ke liye emsidi par jo aarthik bhaar padegaa, uske liye koi raashi ab tak jari nahin kii he
 According to Mayor Kamaljeet, the Delhi government has not given any amount so far to meet the financial burden on the South MCD due to the implementation of this order
 is aadesh se south emsidi kii vittiya sthiti main asantulan paidaa hoga
 The Mayor said that at present the regular sweeper gets a salary of Rs 26,202 every month while the daily scavenger is being given Rs 13,764
 ek dainik bhogi karmchaaree ko niyamit kiye jane par nigam ko 12,438 rupye atirikt dene honge
 Thus, on regularization of 8526 salaried employees, South MCD will have to pay about Rs 130 crore extra every year
 is raashi main yadi mahangaai bhatte aadi jod den to ye raashi badhkar 140 karod rupye tak pahunch sakati he
 The Mayor said that regularization of salaried employees would require more than Rs 140 crore every year
 isliye yadidilli sarkaaris aadesh ke prati gambheer he or niyamitikaran ko sthaayee vyavastha bananaa chaahati he to use philhal agle teen saalon ke liye is mad main 450 karod rupye south emsidi ko jari kar dene chahie
 The mayor alleged that the Delhi government, while issuing the order, did not clarify when and how much amount it would issue to the MMCD
 aise main emsidi atirikt bhaar vahan kar paane kii sthiti main nahin he
 The mayor said that before issuing these orders, the Delhi government should have made financial arrangements in the account of issuing full salary to the current sanitation workers
 meyar ne kaha ki dilli sarkaar pichley saalon main nigam ko safai vyavastha ke mashinikaran or majbootee kii yojana ke antargat vittiya sahaayta jari karti he
 An amount of Rs 318 crore was given to South MCD under the scheme in 2017-18, which is insufficient

 The decision taken by the US just before the meeting of US President Donald Trump with Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been described by Hizbul as a policy of the US government to please India

 kooday ke dher main mili ek carton or ek bag ke saath is kahani kii shuruyaat hui
 When both were opened, the body of a girl lying in seven pieces was found in it
 pahchaan ke liye koi nishaani bhi nahin thi
 The question was who the corpse was
 kisne ek jite jaagate insaan ko saat tukdon main tabdeel kar kooday ke dher tak pahunchaa diya
 Now the police started to identify the dead body, the list of all the missing people from the surrounding area was extracted but nothing was found
 dilli ke ek rihaayshi ilaake main mili volash saat tukdonmen kati thi
 She was packed in a cartoon box and bag
 laash ke tukdon se saaf ho rahaa tha ki laash kisi ladki kii he
 But in the initial investigation neither the identity of the deceased is known nor there is any clue of the killers
 lekin phir achaanak cartoon par likhe kuch harf police ko pehla suraag de jate hai
 This was actually the address of a courier company
 to kya mahaz is pate ke zarie police qaatil tak pahunch paaegi?21 june, 2018, subah 8:30 baje, sarita vihaar, dilliek ghaney rihaayshi ilaake se sate is kudaghar main logon kii nigaah do aisi chizon par padi, jo aam taur par kachare ke dher main nahin hoti
 It was a big bag and a packed cartun box near the bag
 lekin sirf in do chizon ne logon kaa dhyaan apni ore nahin khinchaa, balki inase aati badboo se bhi log pareshaan the
 The foreheads of the people were taken care of and they informed the police
 agle chand minuton main dilli police mauka e vaardaat par thi
 But after rinsing the bag and box, the steps of the policemen stopped
 bag main ek ladki kii laash thi
 That too in seven different pieces
 haath, pair, sir, gardan sab alag-alag
 Police recovered the body and sent it for postmortem
 zaahir he, jis tarah laash saat alag-alag tukdon main kaat kar bag or cartoon main bhar kar nipataai gai thi, usase ye to saafe tha ki maamla qatl kaa he
 But who was the dying girl? Where did you live? Who killed him? Under what circumstances did such pieces of corpse be made? All these questions were still unresolved
 vaise police ko in tamaam sawaalon ke jawaab jaanane or qaatil tak pahunchane ke liye sabase pehle maranevaali ladki kii pahchaan kerani zaruri thi
 But the problem was that despite questioning the people around and telling the full story of the bag and cartun, the dying girl could not be identified
 yahaan tak ki ladki ne jo kapade pahane the, police ne aas-paas ke logon ko wo kapade bhi dikhaae, lekin kahin koi suraag nahin mila
 Many went out in this effort everyday
 isi bich tafteesh ke dauraan police kii nazar ek aisi chiz par padi, jisase use ummid hone lagi ki shaayad isse maranevaali kaa koi suraag mil jaae
 The cartoons in which the cartoons were filled with pieces of lash, were written on the address of a courier company
 police ne sochaa shaayad is pate se hi koi rasta nikle
 She immediately reached the office of that courier company in Gurugram and there she showed pictures of the cartun box to the officers of the company
 ittefaq se courier vaale ne box kii pahchaan kar lee or bataaya ki is tarah ke bade box main unke ek customer ne yuai se parcel book karavaaya tha
 The name of the customer was Javed Akhtar
 ab police courieravaale ke bataae pate par sidhe javed akhtar ke ghar aligarh pahunchi
 Javed Na got only the police here, while also identifying the picture of his cartun box
 usne bataaya ki usne teen saal pehle aise kai cartoon box main yuai se kuch zarurat kii chizein mangvayi thim
 Some of these boxes where he gave to his maid, while some boxes were kept in Delhi's Shaheen Bagh house
 shahinbagh ke us makaan main kuch ladke kiraye par rahete the
 Now the police turned to Shaheen Bagh of Delhi
 police kii sari ummid ab isi makaan par aakar tik gai thi
 Whatever clue was to be found was to meet here
 police kii team javed akhtar kii naukaraani ke paas pahunchi
 Empty boxes were found there, after which when the police reached Javed's house in Shaheen Bagh, there was a lock
 isse police kaa shaq sajid ali par gaharaa ho gaya
 The police started collecting information about Sajid from nearby people, then it turned out that he had told the people there that he was leaving the house empty
 ab police ko talash thi sajid ali ansaari kii
 Many police teams started searching for him
 or aakhirkaar wo police ke hathe chadh hi gaya
 The story Sajid told the police after being caught is shocking
 sajid ali ne police ko bataaya ki uskaa aksar apni patni ke saath jhagada hota tha
 There were two reasons for the quarrel, one was his relationship with another girl and his unemployment
 isi vajah se usne apni patni ko maut ke ghat utaar diya
 20- On the night of 21 June, he strangled his wife to death
 phir apane donon bhaaiyon ke saath milakar uski laash ke kai tukade kiye
 And put the corpse in a parcel box and set it up
 police ke mutabik sajid ali ko lag rahaa tha ki is vaardaat ko anjaam dene ke baad wo batch jayega lekin aisa hua nahin
 That parcel box exposed his plot
 poochtacha main sajid ne police ko bataaya ki uski patni hindu thi, saal 2011 main padhai ke dauraan uski mulaakaat rajbala se hui thi
 Later both of them got married and the wife's name was changed to Juhi
 sajid peshey se beatech ejeeniyar he, lekin uske paas koi naukari nahin he
 Currently the three accused brothers are now behind bars

 If you live in a city where around 30 cases of crime against women and six cases of rape are being registered daily, how safe will you feel yourself? Ankita, a 26-year-old victim of a disguise in a DTC bus last month, asks this question in a strict tone

 puri dilli main yah sankhya 426 he
 Compared to 2013, it registered a growth of 94 per cent

 According to the NCRB, this state also recorded the highest 5,076 rape cases in the country in 2014

 tis par tab jab dilli police ke aankadon ke mutabik, 2015 main bhi 25 fisadi aparaadh vruddhi maujuud he
 Bhagat argues on this increase, "this is not an abnormal growth and it is also due to increasing population or other social reasons
 '' lekin dilli police apane hi is aankade ko kaise jhuthla sakati he ki kul sangyeya maamalon ke aparaadhiyon kii giraftaar main is saal jahaan 0

 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he) The party suffered a major setback after the death of Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar in Goa, which had become the bastion of the Bharatiya Janata Party for the past nearly a decade
 party ke liye sabase badi chintaa ye thi ki manohar parrikar kaa uttaradhikari koun banegaa, jiske liye puure din baithkon kaa daur chalaa
 From party president Amit Shah to senior minister Nitin Gadkari held several meetings and then at two o'clock at night, BJP youth leader Pramod Sawant took the oath of chief minister
 40 vidhansabha siton vaale goa main 2017 main chunaav hue the, jab bijepi bahumat se dur thi or gathbandhan ke sahare satta main ai thi
 But, after the death of Manohar Parrikar, it was impossible to convince colleagues and at the same time it was a challenge to save their mlas
 yahi kaaran rahaa ki pramod saavant mukhyamantri bane
 On the other hand, Sudin Dhavalikar of the allies Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party and Vijay Sardesai of Goa Forward Party will be made Deputy Chief Ministers
 subah se raat tak chalaa baithkon kaa daur
 
 
 Please tell that the struggle for power started in the state only after the death of Manohar Parrikar
 14 vidhayakon vaali congress ne ek ore rajyapal ko khat likh kar sarkaar banane kaa daawa pesh kiya tha, lekin bijepi kii ore se nitin gadakari goa main hi the or unhone lagaataar bijepi vidhayakon or gathbandhan ke anya netaaon ke saath baithak kii
 The name of state president Vinay Tendulkar first appeared for the chief minister's post, but by evening Pramod Sawant's name was stamped
 or der raat do baje pramod saavant ne shapath lee, unke saath 11 mantriyon ne bhi shapath lee
 How is the new cabinet political equation? Let me tell you that the Congress had claimed on Monday morning that the BJP does not have a majority, which is why the Congress, being the largest party, has a chance to form the government
 bhaajapa ke saamne gathbandhan ke saathiyon ko manaane kaa sankat tha, jisamen vah kaamyaab rahi
 Among the oaths taken on Thursday, Pramod Sawant from BJP, Deputy CM Vijay Sardesai from Goa Forward Party, Sudhin Dhavalikar from Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party, Deputy CM and three Ministers GFP, 2 MGP, 5 BJP and 2 Independents
 
 saaf he ki abhi ke liye to goa main bhartiya janata party ke liye sankat talataa aa rahaa he, haalanki abhi vidhansabha main bahumat sabit karne kii pariksha baaki he
 Hearing on the bail plea of his mother Sudha Pathak, jailed for the alleged murder of Delhi-based journalist Nirupama Pathak, who was found dead under suspicious circumstances in Koderma, Jharkhand, has been deferred till June 9
 jila evam satr nyaayadhish em en singh ne police ko nau june tak adaalat ke samaksh maamle kii cese diary, forensik report or post mortem report pesh karne kaa aadesh diya he
 The court believes that Sudha Pathak's bail plea will be decided after studying the documents
 gauratlab he ki post mortem report main kaha gaya tha ki 22 varshiya nirupama kii hatya kii gai he
 In this case, his mother Sudha Pathak was booked under sections 302 (murder), 201 (eradication of evidence) and 120 b (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code
 2019 main jahaan har koi khushi or tarakkee kii dua kar rahaa he, vahiin bhartiya siyasat ke liye lihaaj se bhi yah saal kaaphi mahatvapurn he or alag-alag raajnneetik dal behatar parinaamon kii ummid kar rahe hai
 This year not only general elections are held in front of the country, but also assembly elections of 8 states
 inamen se teen mahatvapurn rajyon main bhartiya janata party kii sarkaar hai
 Apart from the Lok Sabha elections in 2014, Assembly elections were held in Andhra Pradesh, Haryana, Jammu and Kashmir, Maharashtra, Jharkhand, Odisha, Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim
 inamen se maharashtra, jharkhand or haryana main bijepi ne apane dam par sarkaar banaai, jabaki jammu- kashmir main pidipi ke saath gathbandhan main sarkaar bani
 In Arunachal Pradesh too, the BJP formed the government, while the Congress got more seats here
 odisha main biju janata dal kaa jaadu chalaa
 At the same time, Telangana came into existence due to the bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh (2 June 2014) and the Andhra Assembly was divided into two parts
 andhra pradesh ko 175 or telugana ke khate main 119 siten gayi
 Chandrababu Naidu had the opportunity to run the Telugu Desam Party government in Andhra Pradesh, while K
 in Telangana
 chandrashekhar raav ne telugana raashtra samiti kii sarkaar chalaai
 However, in the same year (2018) he dissolved the Telangana Legislative Assembly, due to which elections were held here along with Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Mizoram and again TRS won a strong majority
 aise main andhra pradesh kaa bantwaaraa hone ke baavjood is baar bhi 2019 main 8 rajyon main hi vidhansabha chunaav hone prastaavit hai
 Assembly elections in Maharashtra, Haryana and Jharkhand are very important if seen from the perspective of both major parties BJP and Congress on these three states
 maharashtra main jahaan vidhansabha kii kul 288 seat hai, vahiin yahaan loksabhaa kii 48 seat hai, jo ki sankhya kii drushti se upi ke baad sabase zyada he
 The situation is quite different this time in Maharashtra
 ek taraf jahaan bijepi kii sahyogi shivasena baagi tevar akhriyaar kiye hue he
 At the same time, the Congress alliance on the other hand is getting stronger
 rajya kii raajnneeti main bada dakhal rakhane vaali sharad pavaar kii ensipi ne congress ke saath gathbandhan main chunaav ladane kaa elaan kar diya he
 That is, the alliance of the alliance has brought the politics of the province to an interesting point
 bataa den ki 2014 ke vidhansabha main bijepi ne 122, shivasena ne 63, congress ne 42 or ensipi ne 41 siton par jeet darj kii thi
 The BJP, found in Haryana, considered a small state in terms of the number of assembly seats, is considered an important link in national politics
 yahaan vidhansabha kii 90 seat hai or 2014 ke chunaav main bijepi ko 47, ieneldi ko 19 or congress ko 15 siton par jeet mili thi
 INLD has a very important role in state politics and has had a long reign here
 bijepi ko 2014 main pehali baar rajya kii satta mili thi or manohar laal khatter ko mukhyamantri banaaya gaya tha
 It was only after Jharkhand came into existence as a new state that BJP got state power in November 2000 and since then BJP has got an opportunity to rule here three more times
 2014 main bijepi ne 82 siton vaali vidhansabha main 43 siton par paracham laharaaya tha
 While the main opposition party Jharkhand Mukti Morcha got 19 seats and Congress got 9 seats
 2019 loksabhaa chunaav ke maddenjar congress or jharkhand mukti morcha ke hemanth sorain ek manch par najar aa rahe hai
 The bjp's interference in the electoral politics of Jammu and Kashmir, which has left BJP allies in Jammu and Kashmir and Andhra Pradesh, has increased
 2014 ke vidhansabha chunaav main party ko 87 siton vaale rajya main 25 siton par jeet mili thi
 Due to which the equations of the politics of the province had changed and no major party could get an absolute majority
 28 siton ke saath pidipi sabase badi party banakar ubhari thi or swargeey mufti mohammad said ke netritv main bijepi ke sahyog se sarkaar ban pai thi
 However, after the demise of Mufti Saeed in January 2016, his daughter Mehboobi Mufti became the commander of the party and the government, but the friendship of the two parties broke up by 2018
 bijepi ne june 2018 main pidipi se samarthan waapas le liya, jiske baad rajya main rajyapal shashan lagu he
 The PDP, National Conference and Congress also tried to form a government together, but these three parties failed to do so
 vahiin, andhra pradesh kii baat kii jaae to yahaan kii sabase majbootatelegu desham particendre kii modi sarkaar kaa saath chhod chuki he
 TDP chief and Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu, who was an ally in the NDA government, is now mobilizing regional parties against the BJP in view of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 vidhansabha main bhi unki majbootee he or kul 175 siton main se 102 unki party tidipi ke paas he
 The YSR Congress is the main opposition party in Andhra, which has 64 seats
 odisha main naveen patnayak kaa dankabhartiya jansangh ke jamaane se bhartiya janata party odisha kii chunavi raajnneeti main kismat aajamaati rahi he, lekin use kabhi bhi shashan kaa mauka nahin mil sakaa he
 However, the party continued to contest strongly here and in the 2000 assembly elections, the BJD won an absolute majority in alliance with the BJP and became the Chief Minister
 2014 ke vidhansabha chunaav main bijedy ne kul 147 main se 117 siton par jeet darj kii thi or congress va bijepi mahaj 16 va 10 siton par simat gai thim
 Now once again, Odisha is under bjp's target and has given full force here

 arunachal kii raajnneeti se nadaarad rahane vaali bijepi ne yahaan behatar pradarshan kar sabko chaunkaa diya tha
 After the arrival of the Modi government and after the political event, the entire Congress government of the state joined the BJP
 is tarah bijepi haar kar bhi jeet gai
 Both BJP and Congress were sacked by Sikkim politics
 30 siton vaali vidhansabha main kshetreey party esadf ne 2014 ke chunaav main 22 par paracham laharaaya tha
 While 10 seats were won by SKM
 congress or bijepi yahaan apana khaataa bhi nahin khol pai thim
 In the Modi wave, the BJP, which has been waving saffron poll after election after the 2014 Lok Sabha, has received a big setback in the assembly elections of five states recently

 The continuation of the bjp's top leaders meeting the Sangh chief is going on
 adwani ke baad bijepi adhyaksh rajnath singh kii baari he
 At around 11 am on Friday morning, Rajnath will meet Mohan Bhagwat at the Union Headquarters in Nagpur
 shuukravaar ko bijepi ke aalaa netaa laalkrishna adwani ne bhi sangh pramukh se mulaakaat kii thi
 After the meeting, Advani called the Sangh the father of the BJP
 10 july ko bijepi ke purv adhyaksh nitin gadakari bhi sangh pramukh mohan bhagwat se mulaakaat karenge
 The Aam Aadmi Party, which came out of Janlokpal, can once again take the path of movement for the same Jan Lokpal
 aap ne samajasevi anna hajaare se mulaakaat ke baad phir andolan kii chetavanee di he
 Kumar Vishwas and Sanjay Singh went to Ralegan Siddhi to meet Anna
 unase mulaakaat ke baad anna ne bataaya ki donon netaaon ne unase kaha ki yadi centre sarkaar abaki baar phir baadha daalati he to vah dobaaraa andolan ke liye taiyaar rahen
 On this, Anna told the two leaders that, see, you do your work
 iske baad prashanth bhushan bhi anna se mili
 Anna said the bill was good, but also gave three suggestions
 After listening to the explanation of the leaders, Anna said that the bill is good, but not the one which was conceptualized in Ramlila Maidan
 anna ne is bill ko lekar teen suzav bhi die hai
 1
 lokapal kii chayan samiti main kam se kam saat sadsy shaamil hon, jaisaa ki 2011 ke masaude main kaha gaya tha
 2
 lokapal kii jaanch kaa adhikaar hoicourt ke jaj ko ho
 The Lokpal can be removed if the report of the inquiry committee is passed by a two-thirds majority in the assembly
 3
 If the complaint is false or false, the complainant faces a jail term of one year
 yah praavdhaan uttarakhand main he
 Controversy: This movement is not a bill, Kumar Vishwas and Sanjay have reached to clarify Anna on their Jan Lokpal bill
 kejariwal sarkaar ne somvaar ko hi yahbil vidhansabha main peshkia tha
 But former AAP leader Prashant Bhushan is questioning it
 unhone kaha he kiis bill main ve praavdhananheen hai, jinke liye ramlila maidan main andolan hua tha
 a few days ago, Anna also said- well i separated from Kejriwal
 yah vah bill nahin he jisaki buniyaad ramlila maidan main padi thi
 Reason: Why the Center can obstruct the Central Government can obstruct it because in this bill the Lokpal has been given the powers of investigation against the Central Government officials including mps, mlas in corruption cases
 mana ja rahaa he ki is praavdhaan par centre shaayad hi raji ho
 This bill will now go to the Lieutenant Governor
 vah ise lautaa bhi sakate hai or sahamat hone par grih mantralay ko bhi bhej sakate hai
 The Ministry of Home Affairs will approve it and send it to the President, after which it will become law
 vaadaah yah vahi bill he, vivaad phijulaap ne is bill ko apane chunavi vaade ke mutabik bataaya he
 The AAP has said that its provisions are the same, whose role was formulated in the 2011 Jan Lokpal movement
 yah lokapal ko dilli main naukari kar rahe kisi bhi sarkari karmchaaree ke khilaaf jaanch karne kaa adhikaar detaa he
 Then even if they are officers of the center itself
 2011 ke janalokapal andolan se uthi pramukh maang yahi thi
 What's different from 2011, which is disputed 1
 lokapal ke khilaaf koi kanoonee karrwai nahin kii ja sakati
 He can be impeached and removed by a two-thirds majority in the assembly
 jabaki 2011 ke prastaav main tha ki supreme court doshi qaraar de to use hataaya ja saktaa he
 2
 lokapal ko niyukt karne vaali chayan samiti par sawaal he
 It consists of the Chief Minister, the Speaker of the Assembly, the Leader of the Opposition and the Chief Justice of the Delhi High Court
 jabaki 2011 main saat sadasyon vaali chayan samiti kaa prastaav tha
 3
 jaanch samiti par bhi vivaad he
 Because the draft prepared in 2011 stated that it would be completely independent
 nae bill main praavdhaan he ki alag se ek wing banegaa, jisamen sarkaar se hi adhikari niyukt kiye jaaenge

 Manoj Baitha surrendered and is currently undergoing treatment at Patna Medical College Hospital
 manoj baitha ko kuch bhaajapa netaaon ke aashwaasan or police dwaara ilaaj main koi dheel naa baratane ke vaade ke baad vah sarender karne ke kiye raji hua
 Why is Manoj Baitha looking for Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and Sushil Modi more than Bihar Police? haalanki manoj baitha ne kaha ki wo gaadi nahin chalaa rahaa tha
 As far as bringing them to Patna is concerned, the state police says that it was not easy to keep in Muzaffarpur because there are many injured recruits and their family members could do anything by looking at Baitha but the surrender of Baitha is currently done by the state government
 The cycle does not seem to end

 Police will take Manoj Baitha to the hospital in this case, where it will be investigated that his body was injured during the road accident
 iske baad se adaalat ke samaksh pesh kiya jayega

 jahaan tak unhen patna laane kaa sawaal he, us par rajya police kaa kahana he ki mujaffarpur main rakhana aasaan nahin tha kyonki vahaan kai ghayal bhartee hai or unke parivaar vaale baitha ko dekhakar kuch bhi kar sakate the lekin baitha ke sarender se filhal rajya sarkaar kii mashkil khatm hoti nahin dikhti
 The Chimbihar BJP first denied the relationship with Manoj Baitha, now suspended from the party! bihar main bolero se kuchalakar hui 9 bacchon kii maut ke maamle main bhaajapa netaa manoj baitha ne buudhvaar ko police stesan jaakar sarender kiya
 It is being told that Manoj Baitha has surrendered before the Muzaffarpur SP and after that the police have taken him into custody

 In an open session of the National Council of Janata Dal United (JDU), Nitish Kumar said that anyone has the strength to break the JDU? For this, MLA, MLC, MP will have to break two thirds, otherwise the membership will be lost
 unhone sharad yadav ko chunauti di kiagar unke paas samarthan he, to party todakar dikhaaen
 Nitish Kumar said that he has nothing to say about Sharad Yadav
 chand kilometre kii duuri par sharad yadav jan adaalat sammelan kar rahe the, lekin nitish kumaar ne unhen ishaaron-ishaaron main samajha diya ki unki takat kya he? bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish ne kaha ki party ke 71 vidhayak, do saansad, nau main saat rajyasabha ke saansad or 30 emelsi hamaare saath hai
 During this, Nitish Kumar also reminded the old days of Sharad Yadav
 unhone kaha ki samta party kaa vilay saal 2003 main janata dal you main karakar sharad yadav ko adhyaksh banaaya gaya, jabaki samta party ke us samay rashtriya adhyaksh george fernadis the
 He also said that he lost the election from Madhepura in the year 2004
 phir unhen rajyasabha bheja gaya
 Did not do for them
 itane saalon tak janata dal you ke rashtriya adhyaksh bane rahe
 Nitish Kumar attacked Sharad and said that we are asked that the mandate was received by the Grand Alliance
 unhone kaha ki ham poochna chaahate hai ki kisalie mahagathbandhan ko mandet mila
 We are also entitled to the Mandate for the development of Bihar or for the well being of a family
 jiske saath JDU, usee kii jeetbihar ke mukhyamantri ne kaha ki hamaare bare main yah bhi kaha ja rahaa he ki hamaara koi janaadhar nahin he, jabaki janata dal you kaa apana janaadhar he
 The one with JDU wins the election
 is bich nitish kumaar ne gathbandhan tuutane ke ek-ek kaaran bataaye
 He said that he was repeatedly insulted by saying that you will remain the Chief Minister and that too in front of me
 isse zyada apmaan or kya hoga? kaha jaataa tha ki paristhiyon ke mukhyamantri hai
 It was very presumptuous to be a big party
 hamaare party kaa ek netaa bataa dijie, jisane argedy ke sheersh netaa kaa apmaan kiya ho, lekin mere bare main pataa nahin kya-kya bolaa gaya?mukhyamantri banaakar kaha- jehar pi rahaa hummulaayam singh ke ghar par aane ke baad mujhe netaa ghoshit kiya gaya, lekin ye bhi kaha ki jehar pi rahaa hum
 They raise the illusion that the minority vote belongs to them
 ham vot ke liye kaam nahin karte
 Everyone considers religion as equal
 hamane jitna kaam alpsankhyakon ke liye kiya he, utana kisi ne nahin kiya
 What is the vote of the Sikhs in Bihar? But if we celebrated the festival of light, then people remember
 hamen kisi se dharmanirpekshata kaa paath padhane kii jarurat nahin he, jo janata ko voter ke rup main dekhte hai, wo samaaj kaa bhala nahin karte hai
 No one has the power to break JDU, Nitish Kumar said that he says that Janata Dal will break U
 mukhyamantri ne chunauti dete hue kaha ki kisi ke paas JDU ko todane kii takat he? iske liye vidhayak, emelsi, saansad sab se do tihaai todna padega, varanaa sadsyta hi chali jaaegi
 i cannot compromise on corruption
 ye sabko pataa he or hamaari party kaa bhi yahi vichaar he
 So we decided to go to the NDA
 mere man main kabhi satta kaa khyaal nahin aayaa
 We consider ourselves servants of the public
 apana kuch nahin he
 We do politics
 samaaj sudhaarney kaa kaam karte hai
 It was already told that the Grand Alliance Nitish Kumar will run for a year and a half, he said about Tejashwi Yadav that if he had resigned, he would have gone to the heights
 hamane congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi se baat kii or kaha ki kuch kiijie, jisase mahagathbandhan chale
 You have torn the ordinance, but we still kept quiet
 majabuuran istipha diya, lekin pehle se kuch tay nahin tha
 The offer came from BJP and we asked and accepted most of the MLA meeting
 pehle se kuch tay nahin tha
 It was created by nature
 mahagathbandhan banaate samay kai log hamase poochhate the ki ye chalegaa? tab hamane kaha tha ki dedh saal to chalaa hi lenge
 The Grand Alliance government could run for 20 months with great difficulty
 vahiin, siem house ke saamne argedy or sharad gut ke kuch kaaryakartaaon ne hangaamaa bhi kiya
 Nitish Kumar expressed his displeasure over this and said that he wants to rule the force of the hoodlings
 dilli ke badarpur ilaake ke jaitpur ke sonu hatyakand kaa police ne khulaasa kar diya he

 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne roosi raashtrapati vladimir putin se milane ke baad bhale hi yah kaha ho ki ek purana dost nae doston se behatar he lekin rus bhi ab china kii raah chal padaa he
 In the BRICS conference, Russia kept silence rather than supporting India on the issue of isolating Pakistan from terrorism
 'times of india' main chhapi khabar ke mutabik china pehle se hi jaish-e-mohammad or lashkar-e-taiyaba kaa naam goa diclaration main laane kaa rasta band kar chukaa tha
 But Russia too kept silence on India's proposal regarding these two terrorist organizations of Pakistan
 jabaki bricks main shaamil desh sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad dwaara ghoshit aatankwaadi sanghathanon kii suchi ko sweekaar karne ke liye patibaddh hai
 As a result of Russia's silence, India could not surround Pakistan in the BRICS summit as it wanted

 The Supreme Court has banned the sale of firecrackers before Deepawali in Delhi
 court ke mutabik pataakhon kii bikri par laga yah pratibandh deepawali ke baad 1 november tak jari rahegaa
 According to the court's decision, this step has been taken to assess whether the burning of firecrackers on Deepawali increases the pollution level in the city
 court ke is faisle se prabhavit dilli ke pataakhaa vyapaariyon ne court se guhaar lagaai he ki is siginal kaarobaar ke liye vah apana nivesh kar chuke hai
 According to the petition filed in the court, more than 100 crackers in Delhi claim that they will have to bear a loss of Rs 5 lakh from the sale on sale
 lihaaja unhen is saal pataakhaa phodne kii ijaajat de di jaae
 47-year-old Harjeet Singh Chhabra of Old Delhi has been taking a license to sell firecrackers in Delhi for the past 20 years
 unhone is saal deepawali par pataakhaa bechney ke liye saplir se pataakhe kharid kar godaam ne rakh liye hai
 Therefore, after the court's decision, all their money will be lost
 lekin harjit singh kaa kahana he ki yadi court dwaara faisle ko waapas nahin liya gaya to vah majaboor hokar kharida hua pataakhaa dilli main bhikhaariyon or garibon main baant denge
 This will free up their warehouse but will overwhelm their cost in purchasing crackers
 ise bhi padhein: kaam nahin aayega chini pataakhe-ladiyon kaa 'rashtravaadi' bahishkaaris saal na chhudaayein pataakhe, pradooshan kii khulegi poub supreme court pataakhaa kaarobaariyon kii guhaar par shuukravaar ko faisla sunayegi
 Significantly, this Supreme Court ban on Deepawali firecrackers was imposed because according to the Delhi Pollution Board, the pollution level of the city reaches a very dangerous state on the morning of Deepawali
 deepawali kii subah pradooshan str saamaanya se kaaphi adhik rahata he
 Therefore, the court says that after this ban, the data of Delhi's pollution level on the morning of Diwali will determine whether burning of firecrackers reaches Delhi's pollution level
 gauratlab he ki dilli main pradooshan str main is dauraan hone vaali giravat se shahar main bacchon or senior citijan dwaara saans kii bimaari ki shikaayatein bad jaati he
 However, Deepawali crackers are not only responsible for bad pollution in Delhi
 haryana main is dauraan kisaanon dwaara khet main aag lagane se bhi dilli kaa pradooshan str bad jaataa he
 Apart from these, the dirty smoke coming out of factories running in Delhi and surrounding areas also has an effect on Delhi's environment
 ise bhi padhein: sust bazaar, gaayab kharidaar, vinievesh main kaise safal hogi modi sarkaar?gauratlab he ki desh main deepawali ke liye lagbhag 1500 karod rupee ke pataakhe china se aayaat hote hai
 At the same time, there is a cracker business of about 3000-3500 crores in the country too
 kya hai is maamle se jude kuch sawaal1
 Does the release of firecrackers on one festival make Delhi's pollution level so bad that it becomes difficult for children and old people to breathe here? 2
 yadi deepawali kii subah dilli kaa pradooshan str nirdhaarit str rahaa to kya yah pratibandh hameshaa ke liye pataakhon kii bikri par lag jayega?3
 What will be the impact on the crackers business of 6 to 7 thousand crores in the country due to ban on fireworks sale on Deepawali
 4
 Can a strict decision be taken against other businesses that are causing pollution levels in Delhi after firecrackers

 Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Minister Mishra said, 'farmers agree with us
 unhen log gumraah kar rahe hai or dushprachaar kar rahe hai
 'they were asked that if the Land Acquisition Bill is so good then why are farmers opposing it? He said, 'this law will be beneficial for farmers
 unki aarthik suraksha sunishchit karegaa, lekin congress or kuch anya dal kuntha se grast hai or kisaanon ke naam par siyasat kar rahe hai
 Mishra said that after realizing that there was no issue left with him, the Congress and other parties have started agitating on the positive legal format prepared by the Central Government for the farmers
 unhone spasht kiya ki bhoomi adhigrahan vidheyak 2013 ke kanoon kaa sanshodhit rup he

 He informed that the Central Government has called a meeting of the Rural Development Ministers of the states
 usamen sabhi ne kaha tha ki vidheyak ko saral banaaya janaa chahie kyonki maujuuda praaroop main is kanoon se naa to kisaan ko laabh hoga or naa hi vikaas kaary ho sakenge
 That is why we brought the amended bill so that the shortcomings of the old law can be removed and rural infrastructure can be developed
 mishra ne kaha ki 2013 ke kanoon main 13 pariyojnaayen aisi thim, jinhen riyaayat di gai thi, lekin sanshodhit vidheyak main sarkaar ne un 13 pariyojnaon ko shaamil kiya he or ab in pariyojnaon ke liye adhigruhit bhoomi par bhi bazaar dar kaa chaar guna muaavja diya jayega

 3 months before the election, the Rajasthan government has now decided to give one mobile each to poor families in order to make their plans public
 rajasthan sarkaar jis mobile ko garibon ko degi us mobile main rajasthan sarkaar kii uplabdhiyaan or yojanaon ke bare main jaankaree di jaaegi
 In fact, the government feels that people are not able to take full advantage of the schemes due to lack of mobile and their plans are not reaching the public
 is silsile main somvaar ko ek aadesh nikaala gaya jisamen kaha gaya he ki rajasthan main jitne bhi 'bhamashah card' dharak hai, un sabhi pariwaron ko mobile or data conection diya jaae

 How much will be spent on this is also not decided yet
 mana ja rahaa he ki reliancegiyoki doordaraj tak connactivity he, lihaaja jeeyo hi sabhi mobile dharakon ko die jaaenge
 You have to deposit 501 rupees even though the government is thinking of distributing mobile for the details of the schemes, but those who get these mobile phones, they will also have to deposit 501 rupees
 yani prati mobile 501 rupee jamaa karne ke baad hi mobile milegaa
 However, this money will be deposited as a security deposit and after three years the amount will be returned on the return of the phone
