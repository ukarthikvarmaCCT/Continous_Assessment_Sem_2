 sitapur ke road sho main jaise hi congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi par juuta phenkaa gaya, puraa chauraahaa sann rah gaya

 pakad main aayaa ek yuvakusi vakt kareeb 40 meter kii duuri par ek harakat dikhaai di, jahaan ek 25 saal ke shaks ko bheed ne pakad liya or police ke hawaale kar diya
 As soon as he was caught, this boy started speaking loudly that the country was ruined for 60 years and now farmers are missing

 Shocked by this act, the SPG began to research who this person is

 He is also a journalist of a small rural newspaper, whose icard was also found from him
 ye shaks baar-baar khud ko patrkaar bataakar congress ke kharaab kaarykaal kaa hawala detaa rahaa
 After walking the Congress trying to prove Rahul Gandhi's point right, Rahul Gandhi announced at the next intersection of Sitapur that this is the act of RSS and BJP, but he is not afraid and bowing down
 ab rahul ne elaan kiya ki juuta phenkane vaala shaks bijepi-aresas kaa he, to congressi is hariom mishra kaa itihaas khangaalane main jute hai ki bijepi netaaon ke saath kahin uski koi tasviir mil jaae, to phir rahul gandhi kii baat sahi ho jaae
 There is no connection with any party, till the time of writing the news, this person has not had any relationship with any party, organization or leader, but the work of scrutinizing his relations is currently going on

 Kalki wants to sleep with Kangana, Nude photo was posted tridip suhridadaridranarayan
 This image has the potential for immense power
 kisi daridr ko bhagwaan ke taur par maananaa or utane hi mahatvapurn arth main ishwar ko garib ke taur par dekhne kii kalpana kaaphi aaazaad khyaal he
 It frees a society, a person and even an economy from the desire, need and expectation that one day we will all be prosperous, even if not equally well
 yah shaayad—keval shaayad—dharmik sabhaaon, sanghathanon, samoohon or purushon va striyon ko bhi mukt karata he jo unhen unke utaavlepan se bhautik sampannataa kii taraf jane kaa rasta dikhaate hai
 The image of Daridranarayana also frees us all from the belief that physical objects are the real measure of human importance and therefore the most useful effort is to achieve them
 daridranarayan kaa doosraa darshanik rup satyanarayan kaa he yani satya hi ishwar he
 Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi returned the concept of God to its original transformative and liberating ability by giving God the form of the poor or the poor as God and truth as God
 yahi sambhaavna arthshaastra or arthshaastriyon ko unase dur lekar jaati he
 This was as true in his time as it is in our time
 gandhi ke irdagird arthshaastra ke daayre yaa rajnatik arthshaastra ko lekar gahan chintakon kaa abhaav khaasaa chaunkaane vaala he
 But there are two notable exceptions
 ek the joseph cornelius kumarappa
 His book Survey of Matar Taluka gave us some major conclusions about the poverty of Indian farmers for the first time
 duusare the richard greg
 He was an American, well-versed in law, committed non-violent and capable of living in extremely low facilities
 greg ne iconomics of khaddar main pehali baar khaadi ke arthshaastra ko lekar vyakhya pesh kii
 This was despite the fact that Gandhi had both qualities
 ve aarthik chintak bhi the or arthshaastra kii buniyadi chintaaon kii taraf dhyaan dene vaale sansthagat dhaanchon ko khadaa karne vaale bhi, jaise ki sansadhano kaa aavanton, aajeevika kii rachana, vastuon va sevaaon kaa utpaadan va vitaran, utpaadan ke sadhano ke swaamitv kii prakruti or unka nyyochit vitaran aadi
 Deep concern for the inhuman nature of poverty, structural violence and injustice was the root of his economic thinking
 is par unhone kaaphi kaam kiya
 His commitment to bringing poverty to the center of our national vision was important
 gandhi ke kai sahakarmi the jinhone apana jivan garibi ke khilaaf sangharsh karne, jeevanyaapan ke saadhan khadey karne or vitaran main nyaay va garimapurna jivan sunishchit karne ke kaam main laga diya
 Despite this, there is a clear lack of thinking about their perceptions
 yah daleel dena sambhav he ki sochane se zyada karne kii ahmiyat he, kam se kam garibi unmoolan ke maamle main or us hinsa ke bare main jo avasaron kii kami, nirantar garibi, niraashaa or anyaay se bhari jindagiyon main upajati he
 However, this does not have to be so
 kumarappa kii jindagi is baat kaa udhaaharan he
 This is also reflected in the Gandhian vision of other ideas and scopes
 vinoba bhaave kaa svaichhik bhudaan kaa parivartankaree aahvaan dharm ko dharamshastra ke taur par kiye gaye unke gahare darshanik adhyayan se upja tha
 For this reason, this lack of thinking should be understood
 gandhi ke apane aarthik chintan ko aksar hind swaraj kii galat vyakhya ke kaaran nirantar dakiyanoosee mana jaataa rahaa he
 Gopal Krishna Gokhale believed that the Unchant form was immature and hastily prepared and that he himself expected Gandhi to destroy it with his own hands after spending a year in India
 jawaharlal nehru ne to use bhul janaa hi pasand kiya
 He saw it as a "romantic myth of backwardness" and confessed to Gandhi that he had only a vague memory of that book
 vinayak damodar saavarkar ne mitti ke deeyon or rui kii baati kii kalpana gadhate hue gandhi ko ek niraashajanak ruudhivaadee ke rup main dutkaara
 Even those who had sympathy for Gandhi and his concern for Sarvodaya considered the imagination of their country without machines, railways, doctors and lawyers, unsuitable for a decent life, even if all those things — like Gandhi He used to argue - the search for Swaraj and the glimpse of a real creativity is hindered
 jo log hind swaraj kii pechida prakruti se aage dekhne main kaamyaab ho bhi gaye, ve do dharanaen lekar aae jo gandhi ke aarthik chintan kaa pratik maani ja sakati thim, or ye donon bhi praathmik taur par vichaaron ke daayaron main hi simit ho kar rah gayi
 The first was trusteeship
 'achche vyavhaar' ke tamaam udaahranon ke baavjood yah keval ek khyaal hi he, yah to aakanksha main bhi tabdeel nahin hua
 This question was so foreign to us that Gandhi himself used to use the English word for this even while speaking in Gujarati or Hindi, despite his great ability to devise new meanings of words
 duusari dharna thi naitikta va arthshaastra main rishta or usamen hameshaa naitikta ko praathamikta
 These two notions, despite being different, stemmed from the same basic sentiment — the realm of moral behavior
 kisi trustee kii nijee sampatti ke prati ruchi panpane kii daleel hameshaa se naitik yaa darshanik kism kii rahi he or vah sadgunon ke daayre main aati rahi he
 There is also scope to expand these assumptions further
 khaas taur par paristhitiki ke daayre main ise bakhubi dekha ja saktaa he
 The attitude and conduct that we advocate is adopting the role of trustee towards the earth, its resources and its future
 gahan paristhitiki main isaki khaasi pratidhwani sunne ko milti he
 Gandhi, and his ideas of prioritizing ethics in trusteeship and economics, have been found to be new people, but his utility in state policy in India has been merely to name him some schemes against poverty, even if They are generally meaningful and serious
 is baat ko maanane vaale kam hi log rahe hai ki gandhi kaa aarthik chintan darasal kaaphi doorgaami soch vaala tha
 In 1928, when the modern economic economy was going to suffer the first deep blow, during a discussion, he said, "god bless us that India should never adopt industrialization in imitation of the West
" ek chote se dweep samrajya kaa aarthik upniveshwaad aaj puri duniya ko bedicaon main jakade hue he
 If the entire country with a population of 300 million goes on the path of economic exploitation, it will lick the whole world like a termite
 ''is baat main gandhi aadhunik vishwa arthvyavastha kii sanrachana ke dil par waar karte hai
 The industrial economy was not just the product of steam engines and the need to raise fossil fuels to meet energy needs, but it also required that in Asia, Africa and Latin America, large-scale production and production through colonial means Consumption trend is controlled and regularized
 gandhi bharat main puunji gahan-utpaadan ke der se aagaman se pareshaan nahin the
 He was thankful for this delay
 arthlabh par naitikta ko praathamikta dene par gandhi kaa jor us sakaaratmak arthvyavastha kii buniyaad ko hi chunauti detaa tha, jo sidhe-sidhe is lubhaavni dharna par aadhaarit he ki upabhoktaaon ke taur par samast naagarik praasangik simaaon ke daayre main apane shuddh bhautik laabh ko adhiktam karne kaa prayaas karte hai
 Gandhi spoke of an ideal economic system
 yah sambhav he ki 'ek adarsh arthvyavastha' ke model ko prastaavit kiya jaae jisamen vikaas kii ucch dar, purna rojgaar, aarthik kushalta, sthirataa or yahaan tak ki sthirataa jaise praathmik aarthik mulyon ko hasil kiya jaae
 Gandhi's standard, his emphasis on ethical behavior, irreverence, asthey (not stealing, neither from the earth nor from generations to come), the emphasis on instilling trustees within us all - to achieve economic values Not about gandhi ke janm kii saunvi varshganth ke uplakshya main yojit ek paricharchaa main raaj krishna ne gandhi ke aarthik chintan ko anivaarytya ek adarsh maanak ke rup main bataaya jo saamaanya aarthik mulyon se hatakar tha
 He cautioned that such economic models are seldom focused on "interfering with their general economic earnings", and that such models are "widely successful anywhere"
 'has not happened, whether those models are communist, cooperative or Gandhian
 hamamen se jo garib or avasaron se vanchit hai, unhen apane maanakeey jawaab khud dhundne chahie
 Many times we see destiny in response
 par aisa jaruri to nahin
 The notion of daridranarayana will not please the affluent
 lekin trustiship kaa vichaar sabake liye he
 It is not the idea of redistributed justice as a moral imperative, but against the accumulation and accumulation of capital
 hamen garibi sareekhee hinsa se bachaane kaa ekmaatr tarika maanak vyavhaar apnaane kaa he: chaahe wo ishwar main vyaapt ho, daridranarayan main yaa ishwar ke kisi sandarbh ke bina trustiship main
 Tridip Suhrid has recently published a critical edition of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi's autobiography and Manu Gandhi's diary
 *** The England team, which had a strong hold on the third Ashes Test, suffered a severe setback
 english akraman kii kaman thame pesar james anderson siries ke chauthe test se baahar ho gaye hai
 Injured in second innings Anderson was injured during Australia's second innings in the ongoing third Test at Edgbaston
 unki gendbaaji ke dam par hi england ne australia ko pehali pari main maatr 136 ranon par samet diya tha
 Anderson just 8 in Australia's second innings
 3 over hi daal paae the, jab unhen maidan chhodana padaa
 This is being attributed to the stretch in his muscles
 anderson kii chot ke bare main england cricket board kaa kahana he ki vah team ke strike gendbaaj hai or unka chotil hona team ke liye bada nuksaan he
 The fourth Test match of the series will be played in Nottingham from 6 August
 ‘munni’ or ‘shila’ jaise charchit gaanon ko filmaane main ahm bhoomika nibhaane vaali farah khan ne kaha he ki vah koreography chhodana chaahati hai
 Farah has earned praise as a director in films like 'main Hoon Na', 'om Shanti Om' and 'tees Maar Khan'
 teen bacchon kii maa farah ne kaha ki vah apane pati shiris kundar kii aagaamee film ‘joker’ ke liye nirmaataa ban gayi hai, jiske chalate unke paas koreography ke liye kaaphi kam samay bachaa he
 Farah said that i want to take a break from choreography for a long time

 The film director is currently looking for talent to dance with Hrithik Roshan in the Star Plus show 'just Dance'
 vah film ‘joker’ ke liye bhi koreography kar rahi hai
 He said that sometimes choreography of a song is good but now i am a director and producer
 ab main koreography ko sakriyata ke saath nahin karnaa chaahati
 Her last directorial film 'tees Maar Khan' did not do much at the box office but the song 'sheila Ki Jawani' filmed on Katrina Kaif became quite popular
 isse pehle film ‘dabang’ kaa geet ‘munni badnaam hui’ bhi aise hi charchit hua tha
 It was also choreographed by Farah

 Asaram Bapu, who taught others the lesson of devotion and liberation, is now caught in the legal conflicts of this world
 mukti kaa rastaa dikhaane vaale baapu par khud kii giraftaar kaa khatra mandaraane laga he
 The accusation against Bapu is more serious this time and even the smartest police of the country is not in any mood to get rid of this charge
 asaram baapu par 16 saal kii ek naaballig ladki ne ilzaam lagaaya he ki baapu ne ain swatantraaa diwas par yani 15 agast ko jodhpur ke apane ashram main uske saath balaatkaar kiya he
 In a complaint given in Kamla Market police station in Delhi, the 16-year-old girl has not only called Bapu as her culprit, but also in her statement before the Magistrate under section 164, she has said to forcefully on Bapu
 ladki ke aarope lagane ke fouran baad police ne uskaa medical karaayaa
 The point of sexual abuse in medical has been found correct
 isi ke baad dilli police ne asaram baapu ke khilaaf ipisi kii dhara 376 yani rape, dhara 342 yani gaiyrkanoonee tareeke se bandhak bananaa, 506 yani jaan se maarane kii koshish or protection of children from sexual offenses act yani posco kii dhaaraon ke tahat maamla darj kar liya he
 All these clauses are non-bailable
 to kya baapu ab giraftaar honge? to iskaa jawaab ab jodhpur police degi kyonki jurm jodhpur main hua he
 Therefore, action will also be there now
 par itnaa tay he ki baapu ke liye aane vaale din musiibat bhare hai kyonki peedit ladki ab dilli se jodhpur hi ja rahi he
 Accusations and accusations on Asaram Bapu, playing millions in satsang, are nothing new, but this time the accusations against him have far outpaced all other charges and this allegation is not a minor one, but it is a charge Sexual abuse of minor girl
 us ladki ke yon shoshan kaa, jo gai to thi unke gurukul main shiksha, sanskaar or diksha kii aas lekar, lekin ladki kii maane to asaram ne naa sirf use niraash kiya, balki akele main uske saath jyaadati tak kar daali
 The report of the girl's parents, who studied in Gurukul, Chhindwara, has written against Asaram in Delhi's Kamla Market police station in this regard
 is report kii maane to asaram ne naa sirf unki beti kaa yon shoshan kiya, balki iske bare main kisi ko bataane yaa munh kholane par use jaan se maarane kii dhamkee tak di
 According to the complaint, the family members of this girl studying in Gurukul of Chhindwara had called on August 8 by the warden of the ashram that their daughter's health has deteriorated and Bapu has fixed her daughter for the moment by blowing a mantra from afar
 But since he is possessed by ghosts, Bapu must perform rituals to recover fully
 ye sun kar ladki ke gharavaale apni beti ko ghar lekar aa gaye
 According to the report, after this he wanted to meet Baba for the ritual and then he was told that Baba would meet in the ashram of Jodhpur on 14 August
 ab ladki ke mata-pita anushthan ke liye apni beti ko jodhpur lekar gaye
 There Bapu arranged for her stay and sexually abused her daughter in the same ashram on the pretext of ritual on 15 August i
e
 Independence Day
 ladki ne jab virodh kiya, to baba ne uskaa munh band kar diya or jaan se maarane kii dhamkee di
 According to the complaint, the girl was scared
 iske baad jab puraa parivaar ghar waapas lautaa, to 17 agast ko ladki ne apane ghanwaalon ko sari baat bataai
 The sky cracked on them
 isi bich unhen pataa chalaa ki baapu 18 se 20 agast tak dilli ke ramlila maidan main shivi kar rahe hai
 On this, the family reached Delhi and they went to the Kamla Market Police near Ramlila Maidan and complained about the whole case
 iske baad police ne ladki kii medical jaanch bhi karwaai
 However, according to Asaram Bapu spokesperson Neelam Dubey, all these charges are air and air and soon the investigation will turn milk and water into milk
 baharhaal, is sangeen maamle ke baad ab philhal baapu par giraftaar kaa khatara jarur paidaa ho gaya he
 However, the Jodhpur police will now investigate the case further
 kyonki ladki ke iljaam ke mutabik uske saath balaatkaar jodhpur main hua tha
 In Hindu tradition, being a saint is considered to be above the goodness of society, but when the cloud of controversies is falling on a saint again and again, the purity of the saint is bound to be questioned
 asaram baapu par yon shoshan kaa aarope asal main un par jad chuke silsilewar aaropon kii nai kadi he
 The most sensational case came to light in July 2008 when the bodies of two innocent children studying at Asaram's Ahmedabad ashram were found in the Sabarmati river flowing from the ashram
 11 saal ke dinesh waghela or das saal ke abhishek waghela kii rahasyamayi maut ke baad gharavaalon ne iskaa jimmedaar ashram ko tehraaya
 Even the police in their affidavits had disclosed black magic and other mysterious activities in the ashram
 do bacchon kii maut par hangaamaa abhi thama bhi nahin tha ki madhyapradesh ke chhindwara main asaram ke ashram skool main saadhe chaar saal ke bachche ramakrishna yadav kii laash mili
 As soon as this news was received, there was a furore which turned into a ruckus the next day as another child died in mysterious condition in the ashram's bathroom
 haalanki baad main police ne is maamle is skool ke hi nauveen class main padhane vaale ek bachche ko pakadaa, jiskaa kahana tha ki wo kisi bhi haal ashram kii kaid se aaazaad hona chahta tha
 According to many policemen, this child's condition was due to the hellish conditions of the ashram
 saal 2009 ke disambar ke maheene asaram baapu par unheen ke ek purv bhakt raju chandok ne apni hatya kii koshish karne kaa aarope laga kar sansani failaa di thi
 The incident took place when Raju was returning home from his bike one night and in the dark, two men shot at him with the intention of killing him
 gujarat police ne asaram ko is maamle main bhi namjad kiya tha
 Not only this, Asaram, who is giving a speech to the world to be free from temptation, has also been accused of grabbing the land
 janvari 2009 main gujarat ke land department ke survey main pataa chalaa tha ki asaram ke ashram ke liye ahmedabad or gandhinagar kii kareeb 65000 skhwaayar meter kii jameen par avaidh kar liya gaya he

 Now once again Asaram Bapu is in the circle of questions
 badi baat ye he ki is baar unka ashram nahin balki wo khud yon shoshan jaise sangeen aarope ke nishane par hai
 This means it will not be easy for them to defend themselves
 kabhi sant asaram ke daaman par daag laga to kabhi unki jubaan ne unhen kathghare main khadaa kar diya
 Baba said something so many times that controversy arose
 dilli nirbhaya balaatkaar cond main jab dilli samet puraa desh gangrape kii ghatana se bejaar tha to 7 janvari 2013 ko asaram ne aisa ootpataang bayaan diya ki puraa desh sann rah gaya
 When the statement was disturbed, Baba began to accuse the media that his words have been misconstrued
 baba ke karname sirf yaheen tak nahin hai
 There is a full list of charges
 kuch dinon pehle asaram ke khilaaf ek bhakt ne aarope lagaaya ki pravachan ke dauraan jab usne baba kaa aashirwad lene kii koshish kii to asaram ne use laat maar di
 After this, a case was registered against Asaram on the court's order
 10 april 2012 ko indore main ek pravachan ke dauraan asaran ne apana aapa khokar apane hi ek sevadaar ko apshabd kahe
 He was called a mad servant and ordered him to remove his clothes from the camp
 9 oktober 2011 ko dilli main ek dhyaan shivi ke dauraan badbhole baba ne congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ke bare main kaha ki rahul gandhi kam buddhi vaale bablu hai
 On 27 June 2011, Asaram had said about Mahatma Gandhi that Gandhi should have left the country
 pichhali holi ke dauraan jab maharashtra kaa ek bada ilaaka bheeshan sookhe kii chapet main tha us vakt surat main bhakton ke saath holi kheli or hajaaron litre pani barbaad kiya
 On this Asaram said that we do not take water from any government or government's father
 wo to jarur holi khelenge or maharashtra main bhi unhone holi kheli
 Asaram and the dispute go hand in hand
 kai baar asaram surkhiyon main bane rahane ke liye vivaadon ko hawa dete hai lekin is baar jo aarope un par laga he, wo behad sangeen he
 It is to see how Asaram is overcome by this

 17wein loksabhaa chunaav kii dugadugi baj chuki he
 The BJP, which has held its grip in Himachal Pradesh since 1989, is also ready this time
 isliye to party ne yahaan apane bharosemand netaa prem kumaar dhumal ko chunaav ranneeti kii kaman saunpi he
 Dhumal is turning 75 on April 10, having more than 4 decades of political experience
 is dauraan wo 2 baar siem, 4 baar vidhayak or 3 baar saansad rahe
 In such a situation, setting election bets for BJP in their Himachal parliamentary elections will definitely be in opposing thinking
 prem kumaar dhumal kaa janm 10 april 1944 ko himachal pradesh ke hamirpur jile ke samirpur gaanv main captain mahant ram ke ghar hua
 He did Matriculation from DAV High School Hamirpur, Graduation from DAV College Jalandhar and Post Graduation in MA (english) from Doaba College Jalandhar in 1970
 chaatr jivan main unki khaasi ruchi khelon or raajnneeti main rahi
 He was also the captain of the college volleyball team
 padhai puri karne baad prem kumaar dhumal punjab uniwarsity (jalandhar) main pravaktaa pad par niyukt hue
 Then Doaba College moved to Jalandhar
 yahaan naukari karte hue dhumal ne guru nanak dev uniwarsity punjab se vakaalat kii padhai kii
 Dhumal is married to Sheela, they have two sons, Anurag Thakur and Arun Thakur
 philhal anuraag raajnneeti kaa bada cheharaa hai, wo hamirpur sansadeey seat se lagaataar teen baar saansad hai jabaki arun raajnneeti se dur hai
 For the first time in 1980, Prem Kumar Dhumal, associated with politics, got important responsibility in BJP organization
 unhen bhartiya janata yuva morcha (bhajayumo) kaa sachiv banaaya gaya or phir 1982-1985 tak wo iske upaadhyaksh bhi rahe
 During this time, he worked hard to strengthen the BJP organization
 bhale hi dhumal ko aresas kii nursery main raajnneeti kaa kakehara seekhney ko nahin mila, lekin aaj sangh ke kai netaaon se unke gahare taalluk hai
 Today, while joining the 'main Bhi Chowkidar' campaign, Prem Kumar Dhumal, who has written 'chowkidar' in front of his name on Twitter, is counted in close proximity to Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 is baat kaa gavaah saal 1984 kaa wo daur he, jab bijepi ke diggaj netaa jagadev chandra ne hamirpur sansadeey seat se chunaav ladane se inkaar kar diya to us vakt narendra modi (tatkaaleen- himachal ke bijepi prabharee) ne hi dhumal ke naam ko aage badhaayaa
 This was a rare coincidence of his entry into electoral politics
 haalanki, dhumal yah chunaav congress netaa narayan chand prasar se haar gaye
 But he avenged his defeat in 1989 and retained the seat in 1991
 saal 1985-93 tak dhumal bijepi general secretary pad par rahe
 Jagdev Chandra died in 1993
 is vakt tak prem kumaar dhumal kii ginati pradesh ke bade netaaon main hone lagi thi, or 1993 wo himachal pradesh kii bijepi ikai ke adhyaksh bane
 He held this post till 1996
 is daur main wo ek baar phir bijepi ke pratyaashee ke rup main loksabhaa chunaav-1996 ke ran main the, lekin is baar unhen haar kaa munh dekhnaa padaa
 The year 1998 brought a historic moment for Prem Kumar Dhumal, because this year he became the Chief Minister of Himachal Pradesh for the first time
 unhone puure paanch saal bijepi-himachal vikaas congress (HVC) gathbandhan kii sarkaar (march, 1998 se march, 2003 tak) kaa netritv kiya
 Prem Kumar Dhumal has the distinction of being the only BJP leader to complete a full term as the Chief Minister of the state

 lekin maharashtra main bijepi-shivasena ko bahumat milane ke baad bhi sarkaar nahin ban pai
 After the election results of Maharashtra, Shiv Sena started demanding the post of Chief Minister
 shivasena kii ore se yah bataaya gaya ki chunaav se pehle bijepi ne dhaai-dhaai saal mukhyamantri par sahmati di thi lekin chunaav parinaam aane ke baad bijepi apane vaade se mukar gai
 The BJP was also expected to have a talk but this hope came to an end when the Governor was informed by the BJP that the BJP was unable to form the government
 idhar centre kii modi sarkaar main shaamil shivasena kaa ekmaatr mantri arvind saavant ne kendriya mantri-mandal se istipha de diya or shivasena ne endie se hatane kii ghoshnaa kar di
 The Shiv Sena then approached the NCP and indicated that it might support

 The Governor turned down their demand

 Sources were quoted saying that the Congress was ready to support the government from outside but it was not announced

 Just now the NCP mlas met, after which senior party leader Nawab Malik told the press that senior party leader Sharad Pawar has been authorized to talk to the Congress to form the government
 unhone kaha ki aaj shaam 5 baje congress ke varisht netaaon ke saath mumbai main hi baatcheet hogi jisamen aage kii ranneeti banaai jaaegi
 He said that i am clear that for a permanent government in the state, the three parties will have to join the government

 My best friend Narbhaslal suddenly disappeared a month ago
 unke gharavaale, dost, rishtedaar sab pareshaan the
 He took the complaint to the police, but refused to write the missing report, that the search was first found and then the report was written
 aakhirkaar kal achaanak se narbhasalal prakat ho gaye
 Seeing them safe, i breathed a sigh of relief
 maine daantate hue kaha ki pagal ho kya
 Where have you gone, know how upset everyone is, neither called nor kept my phone closed from above
 main kuch or bolta usase pehle narbhasalal chaalu ho gaye
 Said, 'listen to us first and then clear your lecture
 ’ main unki taraf dekhne laga
 He then moved to the flash back and started telling his story which is as follows
 bole, ‘he sujith, tum to jaanbe karte ho ki us din parliament main bahes chal rahaa tha or jammu-kashmir main anuchhed 370 hataane ko lekar grahamantri, vipaksh kaa garda udaae hue the
 As soon as the Home Minister started pressing the thong (throat) of Article 370, we went straight to Kashmir
 soche the sabase pehle vahaan jaakar do kaththa jameen kharidte hai
 Once you buy land, then by the end of this year, if there is no concrete house, then you will definitely build a house of tile
 marane ke baad to swarg main thikaana milegaa yaa nahin pataa nahin to sochaa jite ji kashmir, jise dharti par swarg kehete hai vahaan kaa sukh bhoga sakuun
 Kashmir left with some cash and checkbook
 lekin baap re baap vahaan jaakar to fanciye gayi yaar
 There will not be as many gach (trees) as there, the young men stood with donali
 aisi aankh laal kar nihaarte hai saale jaise ki ham osama bin laden ke sadhu hon
 Well somehow found a place in a hotel, thought i should return but all the way is closed such that no one can walk and reach the air port
 jameen kharridne ke liye jo paise liye the wo hotle main kharch ho gaya
 Mobile, Internet was all closed, so could not even contact
 dharti kaa swarg kaha jane vaala kashmir kisi nark se kam nahin laga
 So watchful that even breath has to be done carefully
 kuch din aisa hi rahaa to vahaan se chidaiya tak bhaag kar darbhanga main khonta bana kar rahane lagegaa
 Well somehow after a month, when i got some relief, i came out of there
 rajya kii seemaa se baahar aayaa to pataa chalaa ki sushamaa swaraj or arun jetali swarg sidhaar gaye
 So saddened by the news that, without eating food, he took a scooter and went to meet you
 raste main trephic pulisavaala mil gaya
 Then they made the condition that is of the Kashmiris these days
 kashmir main fouj or desh ke anya bhaag main chaalaan itnaa ghused diya gaya he ki jeena muhaal ho gaya
 The traffic man has challaned 15 thousand
 paisa tha nahin itnaa so jhat se maachis lee or laga diya aag scooter main
 Then on foot i have reached your house in some way '
 main kuch kahata isse pehle phir chaalu ho gaye
 Said, 'lend some money'
 maine kaha ki paison kii aisi kya jarurat pad gai
 Said 'brother, the money is in the bank but i cannot understand which branch i can withdraw money from
' maine poocha aisa kyon to bole, ‘bhai jis bank main account tha suna he vah kisi duusare bank main marz ho gaya he
 i am completely confused, my bank has merged with another bank or another bank has been merged with my bank '
 main bolaa isse kya fark padataa he? paise to nikaal hi sakate ho to bole, ‘haa bhai yahi to main kah rahaa hum ki jab paise kisi bhi bank se nikaal sakate hai to phir marz karne kaa kya phayda’
 i said that the government is doing this to keep the banks running in losses from drowning, then said, 'will the money that Nirab Modi or Vijay Mallya ran away from merging brother will be returned
 tum to jaanate hi ho ki sangat kaa asar padataa he
 If a sick bank is merged with a healthy bank, then it is feared that a healthy bank also falls ill
 dekha nahin kashmir ko thik karne ke liye use duusare rajyon jaisaa banane kii koshish shuru hui or enarasi kaa aaparishan hi fail ho gaya’
 After listening to Narbhaslal, i started being narcissistic myself
 turant hi unke saath bhojan karne dhabas kii taraf nikal gaya

 Customers will have to resort to the Airtel app for this plan

 Airtel also has such a plan
 doosraa plan 99 rupee kaa he jiske tahat customers ko 2GB data diya jaataa he

 world class maani jane vaali dilli desh ke kai shaharon kii tulana main bhi kai myanon main phiseddi he
 This has been revealed in a survey conducted by an NGO in Bangalore
 bangalore ke enjio janaagrah ne desh bhar ke 11 shaharon main ek survey karaayaa tha
 In this survey, cities were tightened on more than 100 standards
 lekin jab kul milakar number jode gaye to dilli kaaphi neeche khadi dikhaai padi
 In fact, Delhi finished second among cities across the country in terms of planning and design
 shahar kii kshamta or sansaadhan ke lihaaj se dilli ne sabhi shaharon ko pachhad kar pehla paaydaan bhi hasil kiya
 But out of 21 factors affecting lifestyle, it scored less than 5 out of 10
 inamen krime, pradooshan, saaf-safai or logon ke liye khulaa vaataavaran shaamil hai
 In this survey, even those who examine cities believe that there is a great need for improvement in Delhi
 is survey main na sirf desh bhar ke aabaadi ke lihaaz se bade shaharon ko shaamil kiya gaya he, balki unki tulana duniya ke bade shaharon neuyork or landan se bhi kii gai he
 In such a situation, when Delhi is in many ways behind cities like Surat and Pune, then what comparison? desh bhar main agar bade shaharon kii vikaas kii baat karen to rajdhani dilli kaa naam zahan main jarur aayega
 But has Delhi really made so much progress? Does Delhi have all the resources that make the life of the common man easy? Perhaps your answer is yes, but if you look at the report of Janaagraha NGO, then the figures are very shocking
 duniya ke bade shaharon se mukaable kii baat to darkinar dilli bharat ke kuch chote shaharon se bhi daud main bahut peeche he
 You can also look at those figures which prove that the country's largest capital is the smallest
 world class city dilli kii hakeekat chaunkaane vaali he
 Whether it is about planning or resources
 halaat kaaphi badtar ho chuke hai
 The survey of NGO Janaagraha has shown the real picture of a bright Delhi
 ye survey sirf dilli main hi nahin, landan, neuyark, samet desh ke 11 bade shaharon main kiya gaya
 In the results that were revealed in the survey, Delhi stood behind
 shahari yojana or dilli
 
 
 Only 3 in Delhi account in urban plan
 9 number hi aae hai
 Kolkata has 4 as compared to Delhi
 2 number hasil kiye
 In terms of urban capacity, resources and capital of Delhi, claims are also made on urban capacity and resources
 lekin survey bataata he ki dilli shahar yahaan bhi chote shaharon ke mukaablen bahut zyada aage nahin he
 Capital gains in urban resources equal to small cities in Delhi 2
 9 number
 In the case of political representation and Delhi constitutional and political representation, the condition of Delhi looked very bad
 yahaan chote-chote shaharon ne dilli se is maamlen main baazi maar lee
 According to the survey, Delhi 2 in terms of political representation
 2 ke paaydaan par najar ai
 While Ahmedabad, Chennai, Hyderabad, Jaipur, Kanpur, Kolkata, Mumbai, Pune and Surat won from Delhi
 vishwasaneeyata or dilhisurve ke mutabik paardarshita or vishwasaneeyata ke lihaaj se bhi dilli apni saakh kho chuki he
 Delhi achieved 1 in transparency and reliability
 2 number
 Ahmedabad, Bangalore, Chennai, Hyderabad, Kanpur, Kolkata, Mumbai, Pune, Surat were more reliable than Delhi
 janaagrah ke survey main dilli samet desh ke gyaarah or videsh ke do shaharon ko shaamil kiya gaya hai
 Delhi proved to be a laggard in almost every position
 aise main videshi shaharon ke saath dilli kii tulana karnaa dur kii kaudi he
 This report raises questions on the claims made by the Delhi government, in which the Chief Minister of Delhi does not get tired of telling that the capital is a world class city

 (also from input language) (input bhashaa se bhi) In Mau assembly constituency, Bahubali Mukhtar Ansari has reached the assembly by demolishing the strong siege of BJP and SP
 sapa se beabaru hone ke baad apni pratishtha bachaane kaa un par baari dabaav tha
 He has kept his seat in jail while in jail
 is baar bijepi ne bhi unhen bahut zyada gherne kii koshish kii thi lekin uske mansoobey safal nahin ho paae
 The Prime Minister himself had called him as 'bahubali' in the public meeting of Mau and he has fielded his 'katappa' to end this 'bahubali'
 piem modi ne 'katappa' isliye kaha tha kyonki is seat par bhaajapa ne rajbharon kii party bhartiya samaaj party ke ummidavaar ko gathbandhan ke tahat utaara tha
 Mahendra Rajbhar was in the field from Bhaspa
 mahendra 2012 ke chunaav main mukhtaar ke saath the or unhone apni birdari ke vot dilaane main ahm bhoomika nibhaai thi
 But this time he himself was in front of them
 modi ne isliye unhen 'katappa' kii sangya di thi
 bsp's 'bahubali' Mukhtar defeated him by 7464 votes
 mukhtaar ansaari ne yah chunaav jail se ladaa tha
 He could not come for the entire election, so his younger son Umar Ansari took over the campaign
 pehle umr or unke samarthakon ko ummid thi ki mukhtaar ko perol mil jaaegi, par aisa nahin hua
 Those who commanded Mukhtar's campaign had already claimed that the public would win them by a huge number of votes as much as the opposition parties try and do not let them come to the area and this happened
 tippaniyan Mukhtar has won from Mau in the last two elections as an independent candidate under the banner of his party, Qaumi Ekta Dal
 is baar jeet pakki karne ke lihaaj se samaajawaadee party main apni party kaa vilay tak kar liya, lekin yadav parivaar main machi mahabharat ke baad alag ho gaye or hathi ke saathi ban gaye
 Mayawati not only held a huge rally in favor of Mukhtar but also gave a befitting reply to the statements of PM Modi
 mayawati ne mau kii raily main takreeban do ghante kaa lanbaa bhaashan diya tha
 In fact, the need for support for Mukhtar this time was because the BJP was making inroads into the vote bank of the dominant castes in the area
 mukhtaar ke mukaable main usne rajbhar samaaj ke ummidavaar ko maidan main utaara he, jinaki yahaan acchhee aabaadi he
 The alliance of SP and Congress made it difficult for Mukhtar to win
 is rode ko zyaada dhar dete hue pradhanmantri ne yahaan kii jansabha main elaan bhi kiya ki bahubali ke khilaaf hamane 'katappa' ko utaara he, jo bahubali ko khatm kar degaa lekin aisa na ho sakaa

 pehle umr or unke samarthakon ko ummid thi ki mukhtaar ko perol mil jaaegi, par aisa nahin hua
 Those who commanded Mukhtar's campaign had already claimed that the public would win them by a huge number of votes as much as the opposition parties try and do not let them come to the area and this happened

 Mayawati not only held a huge rally in favor of Mukhtar but also gave a befitting reply to the statements of PM Modi
 mayawati ne mau kii raily main takreeban do ghante kaa lanbaa bhaashan diya tha

 Minority Affairs Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi has strongly condemned the burning of PM Modi's effigy at JNU by Congress student unit NSUI
 nakvi se khaas baatcheet kii hamaare samvaadadaata ne
 Naqvi said that such mentality is not in the interest of the country
 sawaal- naqvi ji jeenyu main modi amit shah samet kai logon ke putale dashahra par phunke gaye hai
 By NSUI, that Modi is Ravana? Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi is a student at JNU
 unki samskruti or sanskaar hamaari samaj se baahar he ki jab puraa desh aatankwaad ke khilaaf ladaai main ekajute he
 There are some students who are burning effigies of such people in JNU
 jo aatankwaad ke khilaaf ladaai lard rahe hai
 Such rites and culture will drown such students
 jeenyu ko bhi dubone main bhi madadgaar sabit hogi
 Question- Naqvi Ji, some people say that even if there is a case of oppression of Dalits, it is happening in the name of cow protection, they say that all this is happening under the protection of all of them? Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi - Oppose government policies Resist aapako pasand nahin aa rahi he
 Resist them
 lekin jo rashtriya suraksha se jude sawaal hote hai
 The country is united on that
 to us par alag sur alaapenge
 You will raise slogans on him that Afzal we are ashamed, your murderer is alive

 So what kind of mentality does it reflect

 Global rating agency Moody's said on Monday that the weak monsoon could be adverse to India's financial standing as it is expected to increase food inflation and fiscal deficit
 tippaniyan The Indian Meteorological Department has reduced its monsoon estimate for the year 2015 from 'below normal' to 'weak'

" ’’ The performance of Indian off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin in the final match of the Champions Trophy 2017 was somewhat reminiscent of Wahab Riaz of Pakistan against India in the league match
 final match ke pehle aswin chongrast the or unke khilne ko lekar sanshay barkaraar tha
 Although Ashwin played fit and in the match, but for him this match proved to be very disappointing in terms of bowling
 aswin ne apane 10 over ke cote main bina kisi madan ke 70 ran kharch kiye or ve koi wicket lene main naakaam rahe
 This is the most expensive bowling analysis of any player in the final of Champions Trophy
 gauratlab he ki isse pehle bharat ke khilaaf group mukaable main pakistan ke wahaab riyaj kii bhi chaar june ko khub dhulaai hui thi
 Wahab scored 8 in this match
 4 over main 87 ran lutaae the or koi wicket unke khate main nahin aayaa tha
 Not only this, during this match, left-arm Pakistani fast bowler Wahab was out of the tournament due to injury
 bangladesh ke khilaaf ek june ke mukaable main england ke jaik ball ko bhi aise hi anubhav se guzarana padaa tha
 In this match, Ball had spent 82 runs in 10 overs and got a wicket

 Shabbir Khan, the director of the film, says, "it was very dangerous because Tiger had to run on the narrow strip first and then jump from the 20th floor of the building

 gauratlab he ki pichley saal sitambar memriliance geyonne bhartiya doorsanchaar bazaar main kadam rakhaa
 Reliance Jio launched voice calls and 4G services free of charge and continued its free offers till March this year
 saal 2012 kaa ant dhamaake yaa fusfusaahat ke saath nahin balki chitkaar ke saath hua he
 Since 2010, scams have been hurting India in many ways
 desh ko 2010 main rashtramandal khelon kii herapheri or phir 2ji ghotaale ke kaaran sharmasaar hona padaa
 Both of these cases earned Anna Hazare tremendous support and acceptance in 2011
 uske baad isi samarthan par savaar arvind kejariwal kii khod-khod kar keechad oochhaalane vaali team ne rajnatik varg par khub keechad phenkaa
 Everyone from Nitin Gadkari to Salman Khurshid was targeted, not even those who were close to them
 do saal kii rajnatik galatiyon ke baad yah ummid kii ja rahi thi ki teesraa saal chizon ko thik kar degaa
 But where are we so lucky! 2012 began with noise and remained at the same pace throughout the year, even as the anti-rape protests raised that tone even further
 koyala ghotaale ke baad farrukhabad main salmaan khurshid ke khilaaf pradarshan, kudankulam main parmaanu sanyantr ke khilaaf virodh pradarshan, assam main hatyaein, robert wadra kaa pardaafash jaisi ghatnaon ne desh ke rajnatik mood ko bigaad kar rakh diya
 Nobody expected it
 jab disambar kii sard raat ko dilli kii ek 23 varshiya ladki ko balaatkaar ke baad murda jaanakar police kii naak ke neeche phenk diya gaya to kuch atyant jwalantsheel cheez desh ke javaanon main samaa gai
 These youths were without any leadership but were not directionless
 ve india get par jamaa hue or unka gussa desh ke duusare hisson main bhi fail gaya
 The poignant incident of rape provoked the anger of the people, who were already on the verge of boiling
 ek baar phir rajnatik varg ne ise berukhi ke saath liya jo ab is varg kii pahchaan ban chukaa he
 No minister came to the protest venue, even no important person from the ruling establishment walked on the grass and asphalt of India Gate
 grih mantri susheel kumaar scindia kaa vichaar tha ki aise kisi kadam se kharaab misaal kaayam hogi
 In the end, he made his plea with this unsubstantiated statement: "if 100 tribals can be killed in Chhattisgarh or Gadchiroli tomorrow, can the government also be there
" ”is bhulaai na jane vaali asamvedansheeltaa ko itihaas main ankit kiya janaa chahie
 This is enough to send the mistake of Queen Marie Antoinette of France to another position in which she said that if people do not have bread to eat then why do they not eat cake
 scindia ke bachaav ko police pramukh ne apana liya or kaha ki agar shantipurna pradarshnkaree police karrwai main jakhmi hote hai to yah buree baat hogi or unhone use ''kaulatoral damege (paroksh nuksaan)” kaa naam diya
 Was he making a statement as a police chief or as the head of an aggressive army? Shinde's statement is a sign of the virus that has engulfed the political class
 is varg ke duusare logon ne scindia kii tarah hamaare chehron par khankhaara yaa chhinka nahin hoga lekin unamem bhi yah beemaari bahut gahari he
 Of course, there should be a government where people are being killed and raped
 america ke raashtrapati baraak obama ne yahi kiya jab ek chote se shahar canacticat main ek pagal vyakti ne 27 logon ko maut ke ghat utaar diya tha
 Look at India, how different things are here
 jab yuva pradarshnkaree cheekh-cheekh kar apni baat pahunchane kii koshish kar rahe the, usee samay bujurg netaa apana munh kholane ko lekar pasopesh main the
 Our Prime Minister tried to check the political mood for five days to speak a written statement in front of the media
 uske baad bhi unhone televijan waalon se poocha ki kya itnaa 'thik he!’ kahin andar unako yah laga hoga ki unka vahi purana raag logon ke dilon ko chhu bhi paaya he yaa nahin lekin unke liye yah sab myne nahin rakhata
 All this was said according to a custom and in the same way people rejected it
 pehle bhi kashmir se lekar kokarajhaar tak balaatkaar kii bhayanak ghatnaayen hoti rahi hai
 According to the police data of 2011, there are some incidents of rape in the capital every 18 hours
 un garib bacchon ke bare main sochen jinka shoshan hua tha or jo 2005 ke nithari maamle main narbhakshi pravriti kaa shikaar hue the
 It may come to mind of some people that the protesters landed on the streets of Delhi this time because the victim of rape was a middle class girl and not a poor or a tribal living in the jungles
 lekin aise log asal mudde se chook gaye hai
 Does it matter that the fire burned for so long that everyone felt the heat? If rape that makes fast track justice compulsory, women of all classes will benefit from it
 pehle se hi ek lakh se zyada balaatkaar ke cese adaalaton main lambit hai or inaki taadaad badhati hi ja rahi he
 When the question is about the honor of women, it will have an impact on the party line and social division
 kaaran yah nahin he ki har netaa kii bhi bahan, beti or patni he
 The thing is that every party has kept the accused of rape in Parliament or House
 aakhir hamaare netaaon ko is baat kii ghoshnaa karne ke liye kya chahie ki unhone apni suraksha main kaaphi had tak katautee kii he? isse fouran hi hajaaron kii sankhya main police bal mukt ho jayega jisase ve sadakon par paharaa de sakenge
 After all, why can't our mps implement the recommendations of the Police Reform Commission? They can also go a step ahead and declare that those who are accused of rape will no longer get tickets from their party
 aage badhen, hamen hairat main daal den or hamaare nae saal ko kuch khaas bana den
 It is true that some charges against the leaders cannot stand in the courts and it is also not right to think of someone as a criminal before he is declared a criminal in the court
 yah baat bhi sach he ki kabhi-kabhi shararti or matlabi tatv jhuthe iljaam lagaate hai
 Still people want such allegations to be bowed head on
 baharhaal, ek pratinidhi loktantr ko kanoon ke paalan ke taur par kisi cheez ke auchity ko dekhnaa chahie
 Otherwise, we will always be sitting on such a bomb, which will have a chance of bursting every moment
 yah maamuli police cese ko bhi itnaa mahatv degi ki sarkaar kii chulein tak hill jaae
 Something like this has been happening for many years, including 2012
 isamen koi shaq nahin ki balaatkaar har jagah hota he, yahaan tak ki behtareen or niyantran vaale halaat main bhi
 But at that time, their influence is increased by personal crime when the complaints of people are so high, then there is a need to take big steps
 koun he jise kisi viypi kii awajahi se pareshaani na hui ho? khuleam pulicekarmiyon ko ghoose lete hue kisne nahin dekha he? koun he jo yah nahin jaanata he ki kanoon kaa paalan kanoon todgaye se zyada mushkil he? kisne nahin padhaa he ki bade-bade ghotaale netaaon kii chhatrachhaaya main hote hai? or koun he jo sahi chizon par paidaa hone vaale gusse main khud ko asahaay na mahasoos karata ho? to kya aise main india get par jaahir kiya jane vaala gussa koi hairat kii baat he jisamen sirf cheekh he, koi maang nahin?koi kah saktaa he ki 2012 ko sirf bhrashtachar virdohi muhim yaa is disambar ko balaatkaar virdohi pradarshnon ke taur par yaad nahin kiya janaa chahie
 Political parties have also played their part
 sansad main kuch point koyala ghotaale or khudara bazaar main epadi ke maamle par hasil kiye gaye hai
 People have also taken to the streets on this type of false fight in Parliament, carrying banners and placards in their hands
 phir bhi in pradarshnon ne logon ko prerit nahin kiya
 It used to be that this is Nura wrestling in which each other is being beaten in turn
 sankshep main unamem kisi ne bhi party se alag hatakar na to josh, na jindadilii or na hi eemaandaaree kaa pradarshan kiya
 They say that the absence of any news is good news, so the absence of any news in this way is also a bad thing
 yah sab itani jaldi-jaldi ho rahaa he ki yah apni ahmiyat khote ja rahe hai

 Pakistan tehreek-e-insaf (PTI) leader Imran Khan was carrying out the independence march and Sadar Qadri of Pakistan Awami Tehreek (PAT) has the slogan of Inquilab March
 imran khan khud ko maseehaa maanate hai or pichley saal ke aam chunaav main apni party kii karaari haar ko abhi tak pachaa nahin paae hai
 He had earlier demanded a rigorous inquiry into the four constituencies and gradually gave his movement different heights of hollowness
 chunaav sudhaar or jaanch kii unki mul maang main kuch sach najar aata he, lekin na sirf sattarudh dal balki pakistan ke chunaav ayog, kaamchalaoo sarkaar, adaalat ke sadasyon or ek televijan channel par bhi baar-baar dhaandhlee or bhrashtachar ke aarope lagaakar unhone apana kuch bhala nahin kiya he
 As the acting Chief Minister of Punjab in the 2013 elections, journalist Najam Sethi said that every domestic and foreign election watchdog team has described this election as the most impartial since 1970
 sethi ne kaha, ''jab sarkaar ne chunaav sudhaar karne kii khan kii maang maan lee or supreme court se chaar nirvachan kshetron kii jaanch karne ko kah diya to unhone maang badal di or ab aisa lagata he ki ve sena ko dakhal dene par uksaane par utaaru hai

 unhone apane samarthakon se civil nafarmani shuru karne ko kaha, sabhi vidhansabhaon main apane sadasyon ke istife kaa elaan kar diya
 This does not include Khyber Pakhtunkhwa where his party is in government
 khabaron se sanket miltaa he ki unki party ke kai vidhayak istifon se khush nahin hai or istife turant nahin die gaye
 But given Imran Khan's mastery of magnifying the spectacle, everyone agrees that the Sharif government has set up an all-party committee to talk to Imran Khan about resolving all the issues including allegations of rigging at the last minute, It should have been formed a month in advance
 sarkaar shuru main hi chunaav yachikaaon par apni kanoonee sthiti bahut spasht kar sakati thi (yani kah sakati thi ki inkaa nibatara karne kaa adhikaar tribunel ko he, sarkaar ko nahin)

 ”asal main sankat ke dauraan bangladeshi model kii tarah technocratic vyavastha kii baat phir saamne ai jisamen sena nyaaypalika ke saath milakar antarim sarkaar bana le
 Sethi feels that the intervention of the army will prove extremely harmful for Pakistan, political parties and society
 unka kahana he, ''fouj yakini taur par imran ko pichley daravaaje se pakistan par thope nahin sakati kyonki punjab, sindh or baluchistan praanton main unka koi vajood nahin he or pakistan ke anya jaateey or rajnatik samudaay bhi unke naam se bhadak uthenge

 darasal anuchhed 370 par liye gaye faisle se pakistan baukhala gaya he
 He can resort to nefarious antics to disturb the valley in such an environment
 aise main centre sarkaar puri tarah sajag he
 Home Minister Amit Shah may also give further momentum to this dialogue campaign in the coming years
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki vah swatantraaa diwas ke aasapaas ghati ja sakate hai
 Modi government, which is bringing the valley into the mainstream, is trying to bring the valley into the mainstream of development
 pichley saal oktober main saat saal ke baad panchayat chunaav karaae gaye
 After the election of sarpanches, the Modi government made arrangements to send money directly to the account of the panchayats of Jammu and Kashmir
 taaki paise kaa istemaal sahi se gaanvon ke vikaas main ho sake
 For this, the Modi government sanctioned Rs 3700 crore
 pehali kisht panchayaton ke khate me bheji ja chuki he
 Apart from this, government machinery is being sent to the inaccessible villages of the valley by the Governor
 taaki sthaneey janata kii samasyaon kaa nivaaran ho sake
 Work is now being done to bring all the schemes from the Central Government to the ground in Jammu and Kashmir
 chaahe rasoi gas silendar kii yojana ujjwala ho yaa phir muft ilaaj kii ayushmaan yojana
 The Modi government believes that when the Kashmiri people get the benefit of government schemes, they will be satisfied
 use lagegaa ki sarkaar jo kuch kar rahi he, unke hit ke liye kar rahi he
 After the normalcy of the election, Article 370 is ineffective, it may take some time for the assembly elections to take place due to the atmosphere of the valley
 sansad main grih mantri or apane sambodhan main piem modi kah chuke hai ki bhale hi jammu-kashmir centreshasit pradesh rahegaa, magar vahaan vidhansabha chunaav pehle kii tarah honge or mukhyamantri bhi hoga
 There will not be an assembly in Ladakh alone
 sutron kaa kahana he ki modi sarkaar pehle ghati ke maahaul ko saamaanya karnaa chaahati he
 After this, when the government will be assured that everything is fine now, then it will be decided to hold assembly elections
 haalanki chunaav ayog apane str se taiyaariyon ko pahase se hi gati dene main laga he

 AUSSIE OF THE DAY: Why this Darwin Cabbie's been recognised as "australian of the day" Posted by Nine News Darwin on Sunday, 30 August 2015AUSSIE OF THE DAY: Why this Darwin Cabbie's been recognized as "australian of the day" indian premier lig ke aathven sijan (ipel-8)main bisisiai ne khilaadiyon ko phixing se bachaane ke liye ek aisa kadam uthaaya he jo aapako hairaan kar degaa
 The BCCI has made up its mind to provide female friends to the players to curb spot-fixing
 iske peeche tark ye diya gaya he ki sattebaaj mahila fain ke jariye hi khilaadiyon ko phixing ke jaal main lapetate hai
 The BCCI has decided to take this step only to avoid this confusion
 indian premier lig ke aathven sijan (ipel-8) main phixing ke jinn se bachane ke liye bisisiai ne ek aisa tarika dhundha he jisapar vivaad ho saktaa he
 The Anti Corruption Unit of the BCCI held meetings with all the players of the IPL teams and explained to them how the bookies implicated them in the fixing trap
 ipel-8 main khabar ai thi ki rajasthan roylske khilaadiyon se phixing ke liye sampark saadhaa gaya tha
 One of the domestic players was approached for fixing, however the BCCI refused to disclose the name of the player
 ek frenchiji ke adhikari se jab hamaare sahyogi akhbaar mail today ne poocha ki is baar khilaadiyon ko khaskar yuva khilaadiyon ko phixing ke saaye se kaise bachaaya jayega? to unka jawaab tha, 'khilaadiyon ko bataaya gaya he ki unhen kis tarah se 'hanitrap' main fansaaya jaataa he
 They are assured that they are very smart and then they are implicated in this illusion
 aisa hamamen se kisi ke saath bhi ho saktaa he
 In this way, after joining the players like a fan, they become personal with the players
 'unhone bataaya, 'ye kaaphi teji se hota he or khilaadiyon se unke rishte badi jaldi majboot ho jate hai
 She goes to dinner with the players and thus becomes closer
 unke antarang palon kaa ms bana liya jaataa he or phir uske baad khilaadiyon ko iske jariye blackmel kiya jaataa he
 Players then have no other way but to get caught up in fixing
 'ab bisisiai khilaadiyon ko khud hi mahila mitra muhaiyaa karaayega, jisase khilaadi is tarah ke mayajaal se bachakar hi rahen
 Former cricketer Madan Lal has described this decision of BCCI as very good
 unhone kaha, 'mujhe lagata he ki bisisiai ne ye acha kadam uthaaya he
 Spot fixing can only be done by players
 sabase badi dikkat he ki zyaadaatar khilaadi aise becoground se nahin aate hai jo fame or chikani chupadi baaten ko samaj saken or ye unke sir jaldi hi chadh jaati hai

 pehali pari main team india ke nami ballebaajon ne 40
 In 1 over, the leg-spinner put arms in front of Steve o'keefe, while in the second innings, he could not play so many overs
 duusari pari main bhartiya team keval 33
 Cheteshwar Pujara, who scored 31 runs for 5 overs, was the top scorer
 tippaniyan Before the start of the series, big things were being talked about the difference of victory of Team India
 koi purv cricketer team india ke paksh main 4-0 kii jeet bataa rahaa tha to koi yah antar 3-1 maan rahaa tha
 However, it is certain that after this 'eye-opening victory' recorded for Australia, these voices will cease to arise
 team india ne pune main spin kaa madadgaar trek banaakar kangaaroon ko fansane ke liye jo jaal buna tha, usamen bhartiya ballebaaj hi funs gaye
 From the first day, if someone was jumping the ball, then someone was staying low
 aise main yah to lag rahaa tha ki match paanch din se pehle khatm ho jayega
 But nobody expected that the match would be settled in three days and the losing team would be Virat Kohli's Team India
 australia ke captain steve smith ne jis andaaj main apni ranneeti taiyaar kii or anubhavheen khilaadiyon kaa istemaal kiya, uski jitani tarif kii jaaekam he
 The pressure has shifted to Team India
 bharat ke lihaaj se is match main dhakka pahunchane vaali baat yah rahi ki captain viraat kohli donon pariyon main nahin chale
 He was out for nothing in the first innings and 13 in the second
 viraat jitne lambey samay se bhartiya ballebaaji kii chunauti kii aguwai kar rahe the, use lihaaj se unke liye yah daur is match main nahin to agle kinhi match main aana tha
 Actually, in the midst of this failure of Virat, no other batsman would be responsible for grooming the innings and reaching a respectable score
 yah kaam vijay, rahul, pujaara athwa ajinkya rahane main se koi kar saktaa tha
 Unfortunately this did not happen
 australian team ne team india ke 19 match main aparaajey rahane ke kram ko todaa or use aisi haar par majaboor kar diya jo lambey samay tak tis detii rahegi
 
 
 
 siries shuru hone ke pehle isamen team india kii jeet ke antar ko lekar badi-badi baaten kii ja rahi thim
 If a former cricketer was referring to a 4–0 win in favor of Team India, someone was assuming the difference 3–1
 baharhaal, yah nishchit hai ki australia kii ore darj kii gai is 'ankhen khol dene vaali jeet' ke baad ye awaajen uthni band ho jaaengi
 The Indian batsmen were caught in the trap that Team India had woven to trap kangaroos by creating a spin-assisted track in Pune
 pehle din se hi koi gend jump kar rahi thi to koi nichi rah rahi thi
 In such a situation, it seemed that the match would be over before five days
 lekin yah ummid kisi ne nahin kii thi ki match teen din main hi nipat jayega or haarane vaali team, viraat kohli kii team india hogi
 The way Australia's captain Steve Smith has devised his strategy and used inexperienced players, he is less than appreciated
 dabaav ab shift hokar team india par aa gaya he
 What was shocking for India in this match was that captain Virat Kohli did not go in both innings
 pehali pari main ve shunya or duusari main 13 ran par out hue
 For the long time that Virat was leading the challenge of Indian batting, he had to take this round for him, not in this match or in the next match
 darasal hona yah tha ki viraat kii is naakaami ke bich koi anya ballebaaj pari ko sanvaarane or sammanjanak score tak pahunchane kii jimmedaari nibhaataa
 Vijay, Rahul, Pujara or Ajinkya Rahane could do this
 durbhaagya se aisa nahin hua
 The Australian team broke Team India's order of being unbeatable in 19 matches and forced them to lose such a defeat that will continue to tease for a long time

 jawahar laal nehru vishvavidhyalay (JNU) main feesvruddhi ko lekar students and semester exam kaa bahishkaar kar rahe hai
 At the same time, JNU administration has found a unique way to take the exam
 vishvavidhyalay prashasan ab watsap or email ke madhyam se pariksha yojit karne kii taiyaari main he
 This is the letter, a letter has been sent to all the chairpersons of the center on Monday
 skool of international studies (esas) ke dean ashvini ke mahapaatr ne kaha ki ye nirnay campus main asaadhaaran sthiti ke chalate skulon ke dean or vishesh kendron ke adhyakshon kii baithak ke baad kulapati or anya adhikariyon kii ore se liya gaya he
 But whether this step is being taken in all schools, it cannot be confirmed
 unhone patr main likhaa ki 16 disambar ko subah 9:30 baje hui baithak main sarvasammati se ye tay hua he ki jeenyu ke chaatro ke shaikshanik hit main, emphil / piechdi or eme program ke liye antim semester pariksha main ek vaikalpik pariksha yojit kii jaae
 The letter states that the question papers will be sent by the course teachers to the students registered for the course for mphil and MA programs
 centre ke adhyaksh centre kii aavashyaktaa ke anusaar pariksha kaarykram taiyaar kar sakate hai
 Students are requested to submit answer scripts to concerned course teachers for evaluation
 unhone kaha ki pariksha kii patakatha prastut karne kii antim tithi 21 disambar he
 It is stated in such Dena examination paper that students can write answer books either through email or whatsapp or in person to the teachers of the course
 jo log samay seemaa ke bheetar pariksha script waapas karne main vifal rahete hai, unhen 21 disambar ko atirikt din diya ja saktaa he
 How this process can be conducted in a transparent manner, how it will be ensured that students themselves wrote or copied the exam, how it can be verified
 Indian Express ko jawaab dete hue pro mahapatra ne kaha ki di gai paristhitiyon main koi doosraa rasta nahin he
 i am only concerned about the future of the students
 jeenyu ke shikshak or chaatrasangh (JNUTA) or (JNUSU) ne pariksha lene ke is tareeke ko puri tarah betuka qaraar diya he
 JNUTA said that by doing this completely incredible academic exercise, the whole system is being made fun of again and again
 jeenyu prashasan ne jis tarah se ye prakriya apanaai he, isse samaj main aata he ki ucch shiksha main netritv kar rahe kitne ayogy log hai
 Needless to say that nothing proposed in the note has been decided through fixed procedure
 jeenuasu ne kaha ki ye chaatro ko vibhajit karne or ek ko duusare ke khilaaf khadaa karne ke liye hai jo hameshaa kii tarah safal nahin honge, lekin vyavasthaapak yaa abivipi koshish kar sakate hai

 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ke mandsaur daure ko party kii taraf se chunavi bigul ke taur par dekha ja rahaa he
 In such a situation, there is also speculation about electoral alliances and strategies, the most important issue of which is the face of the Congress Chief Minister
 madhya pradesh congress ke adhyaksh or saansad kamalnath ne angreji akhbaar indian express ko die intervyuu main is sawaal kaa jawaab diya
 When he was asked about the party face in front of Shivraj Singh, he turned around and responded
 kamalnath ne bataaya ki pareshaan kisaan, berozegaar yuva, asurakshit mahilaayein or naakhush vyapaaree hamaara chunavi cheharaa honge
 However, he also said in his reply that if there is a need to bring the Chief Minister's face before the election, then party president Rahul Gandhi will take a decision on it
 unhone purv mukhyamantri digvijay singh, jyotiraditya sindhiya samet duusare netaaon ke bich sabakuch thik na hone ke daawey ko bhi sire se nakaar diya

 88 tha
 At the same time, 36 to Congress
 38% vot share ke saath 58 siton par jeet mili thi
 Although the BSP won only 4 seats, its vote percentage was 6
 43% rahaa tha
 Not only this, BSP stood second in 11 seats
 in sabhi siton par bispi ummidavaaron ne bijepi ko kadi takkar di thi
 In such a situation, in the event of an alliance between the Congress and the BSP, the BJP may have to bear the loss that the assembly elections are to be held in Madhya Pradesh later this year

 In an exclusive interview with Sheila Dixit, Headlines Today managing editor, Rahul Kanwalco, has himself confirmed this discussion happening in the political corridors

 baharhaal, kam se kam ek maamle main na to party or na hi party kii kendra main sarkaar niyamon ke mutabik chalane ke liye taiyaar he
 The Finance Minister in the Central Government has the responsibility of harmonizing with the Central Reserve Bank
 niyamon ke mutabik kendriya rigerv bank ek swytt sanstha he or use desh ke khajaane kii nigaraanee karne ke liye yah swaittata di gai he
 This oversight rests with the Governor of the Central Reserve Bank
 maujuuda sarkaar ke saadhe chaar saal ke kaarykaal main do kendriya bank governor apane teen saal ke kaarykaal ke dauraan kendra sarkaar ke saath khinchataan kaa shikaar hue
 Where in spite of gaining worldwide fame, the Central Government did not show interest in extending the tenure of former Governor Raghuram Rajan
 vahiin, maujuuda kendra sarkaar ke kaarykaal main duusare governor urjit patel apana teen saal kaa kaarykaal bhi puraa kiye bagaiyr chale gaye
 The finance ministry, headed by both the governor and Jaitley, could not sit in coordination with the rules
 rbi-modi sarkaar ke bich ve vivaad jinase tay thi urjit patel kii vidaaiaisa hi maamla desh kii is party ke andar bhi saaf dikhaai de rahaa he
 The party's constitution says on page 13 that the party president will nominate more than 13 vice presidents, 9 general ministers, one general secretary (organization), at least 15 ministers and one treasurer out of the 120 members of the national executive
 manonith kiye jane vaale in padaadhikariyon par party ke kaamkaaj kii alag-alag jimmedaari hogi
 Contrary to this provision made in the Constitution, the post of treasurer has remained vacant in this party for the past 30 months
 lekin party adhyaksh amit shah is pad par rashtriya kaaryakarini ke kisi sadsy ko manonith nahin kar paa rahe hai
 In fact, the post of treasurer of the Bharatiya Janata Party became vacant on 16 January 2016 when the then treasurer Piyush Goyal was given a place in the Union Cabinet
 goyal ko swatantra prabhaar ke saath khanan mantralay diya gaya
 Subsequently, in September 2017, Goyal was given the charge of Railways after the leave of Suresh Prabhu from the Ministry of Railways
 iske baad ek baar phir haal hi main vitt mantri arun jetali kii kharaab tabiyat ke chalate vitt mantralay kaa bhi prabhaar diya gaya
 5 challenges before RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das and due to Piyush Goyal's arrival in the Central Cabinet and changes in charges, the party remained without a treasurer due to a one-man policy
 party main ek koshadhyaksh kaa kaam party ke fund ko sanbhaalane kaa he
 This work includes important expenses such as the expenses of the party's offices, the expenses of campaigning, the travel expenses of the president and other office bearers from the party work
 jaahir he, sawaal khadaa hota he ki jab july 2016 se party ke paas koi koshadhyaksh nahin he to yah kaam beete 30 maheenon ke dauraan koun kar rahaa he
 Significantly, the task of handing over the details of election expenses to the Election Commission is also the responsibility of the treasurer of the party
 lihaaja, piyush goyal ke baad khaali pade is pad kii jimmedaari bina koshadhyaksh ke kaise nibhaai ja rahi he
 Has the party president engaged any member of the national executive for this work? If this is the case, why is this member not nominated as treasurer? If the top level sources in the party are to be believed then the top leadership is at odds with the new treasurer of the party
 aisi sthiti main jahaan party adhyaksh jise is jimmedaari ke liye manonith karnaa chaahate hai vah sadsy rashtriya kaaryakarini ko manjuur nahin he
 At the same time the party president is not ready on the member suggested by the effective members of the national executive
 is matbhed ke chalate party beete 30 maheenon se bina koshadhyaksh ke kaam kar rahi he
 And the question is, how is this party working without the treasurer? ghati main hinsa khatm hone kaa naam nahin le rahi he
 Now the Union Home Ministry has changed its strategy regarding the valley

 BSP president Mayawati and SP chief Akhilesh Yadav have announced an alliance to stop Narendra Modi's Vijayrath in the Lok Sabha elections in 2019
 congress ko is gathbandhan se baahar rakhaa gaya he
 Mayawati explained the reason for not taking Congress along
 unhone kaha ki congress or bijepi donon kii nitiyaan ek tarah kii he
 Apart from this, the experience of alliance with Congress has not been better for SP and BSP, due to which they have not been included
 haalanki mayawati ne kaha ki raibareli or amethi main congress ummidavaar ke khilaaf gathbandhan apana koi ummidavaar nahin utaaregaa
 Mayawati said that both the SP-BSP had fought the elections in alliance with the Congress in the past, but it was not experienced at all
 basapa ne uttar pradesh main congress ke saath 1996 main gathbandhan kar vidhansabha chunaav ladaa tha, jisamen hamaara vot to congress ke liye transfar hua lekin congress kaa vot hamaari party ko nahin mila
 Similarly, in the 2017 assembly elections, Akhilesh Yadav contested along with the Congress, but the SP could not benefit from it either
 unhone kaha ki ek sochi-samajhi ranneeti ke tahat congress kaa vot bijepi main transfar ho jaataa he
 Due to this, Congress has not been included in the coalition
 jabaki sapa-basapa ne pehle gathbandhan karke dekh chuke hai
 In the by-election, the workers of both the parties vote with each other with full sincerity
 unhen koi parhez nahin hota he
 khari-kharimayawati said to the Congress that Congress has ruled in other states including in the country and Uttar Pradesh for a long time after independence
 congress ke raaj main kamjor varg, kisaan, vyapaaree, dalit or obisi ke log pareshaan rahe hai
 Unemployment and corruption have increased during his reign
 isi ke chalate basapa or sapa jaisi raajnneetik partiyon kaa gathan hua taaki congress ke manamaani tareeke se kiye ja rahe shashan ko mukti mil sake
 He said that the approach of BJP and Company and the way of governance has remained the same
 raksha saude kii kharidari main congress or bijepi donon kii sarkaron ne jabardast ghotaale hue hai
 The Bofors scandal took place during the Congress rule, due to which his government was run
 isi tarah bijepi ko rafel maamle main sarkaar gavanni padegi
 Taking a dig at the Congress and the BJP, Mayawati said that the Congress had declared a state of emergency and the BJP had unannounced it
 assam main dekhie kis tarah ke haalat hai
 The SP-BSP will contest the elections in 1977 and the BJP will suffer losses like 1977

 sadar bazaar se lekar dilli ke sabase posh bazaaron jaise khan market or dephence colony market main bhi dukaanon ke sil hone kaa silsilaa jari he
 Amar Colony Market, the largest Ladies Wear market in Lajpat Nagar, has caused a huge outcry among traders since about 450 of the 700 shops were sealed
 abhi tak chote-mote andolan or pradarshan karte vyapaariyon ne ab bade paimaane par ram lila maidan kooch karne kaa nirnay liya he
 In this connection, all the merchant organizations of Delhi gathered in large numbers in the Constitution Club of Delhi and showed their unity
 vyapaariyon kii is maha panchayat main 28 march ko ceiling ke viruddh dilli ke ram lila maidan main maha andolan karne kii taiyaariyon par charchaa hui
 The number of traders from the fund was discussed and all the traders associations were requested to close all the markets of Delhi on March 28, all should reach the Ram Leela Maidan in maximum number of Delhi and show the strength of the traders
 
 association ke adhyaksh praveen khandelwal ne bhivyapaariyonko sambodhit karte hue kaha, 'ab samay aa gaya he ki vyapaariyon ko apni ekta or apni takat kaa pradarshan karnaa hoga
 It is necessary that on March 28, we have to come out in such a large number that the streets of Delhi should be stopped, so that the sleeping state and central governments should understand our problems so far
 ' isi tarah alag-alag vyapaaree sanghathan ne apane-apane vichaar rakhe or dilli band kaa samarthan kiya
 On March 21, a core committee of traders will be formed, which will decide the sealing and the preparations for this great movement

 Recovering from the worrying figures of just 1,411 tigers remaining in the country, the new census now finds 1,706 tigers
 khatre main padi is vanyajeev prajati kii sankhya main beete chaar varsh main 12 fisadi kaa ijapha hua he
 Describing the tiger census 2010 as the most comprehensive and state-of-the-art assessment in the world till date, Minister of State for Environment and Forests Jairam Ramesh said, "in the last four years, good work has been done across the country in the area of tiger conservation
 
 isi ke natijatan ab desh main baaghon kii ausat sankhya 1,706 he
 According to the latest census, there are now between 1,571 and 1,875 tigers in the country

 The last tiger count was in 2006
 usamen khulaasa hua tha ki desh main mahaj 1,411 baagh hi shesh rah gayi hai
 The Sunderbans are included for the first time in the latest calculation
 ramesh ne antarrashtriya baagh sangrakshan sammelan ke udghaatan samaaroh main ye aankade jari karte hue kaha, ‘baaghon kii sankhya main beete chaar varsh main 12 fisadi kii badhottaree hui he
 This is a good sign
 ’lekin unhone aagaah kiya, ‘desh main baagh sangrakshit galiyaaron ke samaksh gambhir khatra maujuud he
 The number of tigers has decreased in protected areas
 baaghon ke paryaavas vaale kshetrafal main kami dekhi gayi he
 Out of the total estimated number of tigers, 30 per cent are living outside 39 protected areas
 baaghon ko khanan mafia or bhu-mafia se khatra he
 Coal mining and irrigation projects are also hostile to tiger conservation
 ’paryaavaran or van mantralay tathaa dehradun sthit bhartiya vanyajeev santhaan dwaara nau karod rupee kii laagat se 39 baagh sangrakshit kshetron main yah gananaa kii gayi

 In Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh, however, tigers have reduced

 Western Ghats are ahead in terms of growth

 In Hoshangabad, Betul, North Ghats of Narmada River and Kanha Kisali, there has been a significant decline in the number of tigers
 ramesh ne kaha, ‘desh ko nau fisadi kii aarthik vruddhi dar chaiye
 There is no dispute in this
 lekin khaskar baaghon ke maddenjar baat karen to hamen paryaavaran or vikaas ke bich sateek santulan rakhana hoga
 The Union Minister said that it is a matter of concern that tigers are wandering outside the Ranthambore, Corbett and Sariska protected areas
 isse baagh or maanav ke bich sangharsh kii ashanka bad jaati he
 Conservation of tigers will be a big challenge for us in the coming years as the country is under increasing pressure in terms of demographics and development
 aise main baagh sangrakshit kshetron par hameshaa khatra mandaraata rahegaa
 Ramesh said that 38 percent of the tigers were detected this time through camera trapping
 camere ke jariye aise 1,615 baaghon kii tasviren kaid kii gayin, jinaki umr dedh varsh se adhik he
 In the previous census 500 pictures of each tiger were taken for review, this time for analysis 615 pictures of each of the 38 percent tigers included in the census have been taken
 unhone kaha ki ek or utsahjanak baat he ki jin rajyon ne baaghon ke liye ‘bafer jone’ ghoshit kiye hai, vahaan baaghon kii sankhya main acha ijapha dekha gaya he
 Ramesh hoped that the Planning Commission would increase the allocation for tiger protected areas in the supplementary budget
 hamen 50,000 pariwaron kaa baagh sangrakshit kshetron ke bheetar se anyatra punarvaas karnaa he
 So far only three thousand families have been rehabilitated due to lack of funds

 These 14 things also include petrol and diesel

 Bharatiya Janata Party President Amit Shah accused the Congress of spreading confusion over the Land Acquisition Bill, saying that this bill is not anti-farmer but a friend of farmers
 madhya pradesh kii rajdhani bhopal ke bhel dashahra maidan main ravivaar ko yojit sushasan sankalp kaarykram main nirvaachit pratinidhiyon ko sambodhit karte hue shah ne kaha ki congress ne hameshaa kisaanon ke naam par raajnneeti kii he, magar pradhanmantri narendra modi ke netritv vaali centre sarkaar aisi sarkaar he jo kisaanon ke hit main faisle le rahi he
 Compensation for farmers has also been increased in case of natural calamities
 shah ne bhoomi adhigrahan vidheyak kii charchaa karte hue kaha ki congress puure desh main bhram failaa rahi he, magar is yojana se kisaanon ko hi laabh hone vaala he, kisi udyogpati ko unki jameen nahin di jane vaali hai
 The reality is that farmers' land will be taken up for development works such as electricity, roads, schools, hospitals, border security etc
 is jameen ke badale kisaan ko shahar main doguna or gaanv main chaar guna daam milegaa
 This will benefit the farmer, he will buy land from another part of the amount received in exchange for the acquired land and three parts will be used in his life
 unhone aage kaha ki desh main 30 saal baad koi purna bahumat kii sarkaar satta main ai he
 This government has done many historical works in 11 months
 congress ke kaal main jahaan bhrashtachar kaa bolbalaa tha, vahiin modi netritv vaali sarkaar ke 11 maheene ke kaal main bhrashtachar kaa ek bhi maamla saamne nahin aayaa he
 The country has benefited from millions of crores by auctioning coal mines and spectrum
 bijepi adhyaksh shah ne kaha ki congress beete 10 saalon main mahangaai kam karne kii baaten karti rahi magar mahangaai kam nahin hui, vahiin bijepi ne satta main aane ke 11 maah main hi mahangaai dar main kaaphi kami laa di he
 This government is a working government
 shah ne sushasan sankalp kaarykram main hissaa lene aae pradesh bhar ke bijepi ke nau hajaar pratinidhiyon se kaha ki ab unki jimmedaari bad gai he, kyonki pradesh kii janata ne panchayat se lekar sansad tak ke liye bijepi ke pratinidhiyon ko jitayaa he
 The comments unhone sabhi se aahvaan kiya ki ve centre sarkaar kii yojanaon ko mahajanasampark abhiyaan ke jariye ghar-ghar tak pahunchaaen or congress dwaara failaae ja rahe bhram kaa khaatmaa karen

 bharat ke mahaan cricketer rahul dravid ne test cricket se sanyas lekar apane 16 saal ke antarrashtriya kariyar ko alavida kah diya
 Former Indian captain Dravid is the second highest run-scorer in the history of Test cricket and was responsible for the Indian middle order for many years
 39 varshiya dravid australia ke niraashajanak test daure ke baad bhartiya cricket ke teen umradraj khilaadiyon- sachin tendulkar or vivies lakshmana main sanyas lene vaale pehle khilaadi ban gaye
 "I announce my retirement from international and domestic first-class cricket," Dravid said at a specially convened press conference
 maine bharat ke liye 16 saal pehle apana pehla test khelaa tha or aaj mujhe lagata he ki aage badhane kaa samay aa gaya he
 i was like a boy in India who dreams of playing for his country
 maine kabhi nahin sochaa tha ki meri yatra itani lambii or itani paripurna rahegi
 '' dravid ke saath bisisiai adhyaksh en shrinivasana or purv bhartiya captain anil kumble bhi maujuud the
 He said, "no dream can be fulfilled alone
 main un logon kaa shukriya adaa karnaa chaahunga, jinhone mujhe cricket sikhaaya or mujh par bharosa rakhaa
 My junior coaches and various junior national camps in Bengaluru made me so obsessed with cricket
 " Dravid said, "my coaches have improved my cricket at the international level and that has helped to enhance my personality
 physio or trainron ne mujhe feet banane ke liye kaaphi mehnat kii, jo aasaan kaam nahin he, jisaki badaulat main 30 kii umr ke antim padaav main bhi kheltaa rahaa
 "he never gets any credit to the selectors in India, but he trusted me many times, i didn't trust myself so much and i am thankful to him for that," he said
 main jitne bhi captainon kii aguwai main khelaa, unhone meraa netritv kiya or mujhe prerit kiya
 Most of all i would like to thank the teams i played with
 ’’ Dravid said he had many wonderful memories associated with his teammates, including some of the greatest players in the game
 unhone kaha, ‘‘main kariyar ke shuru ke dinon main karnataka kii team se khelaa or ve saal mere liye kaaphi manoranjak or sikh hasil karne vaale rahe
 "I was fortunate to be part of the glorious era in the Indian team, in which India played some of the best cricket at home and abroad
" team ke kai saathi mahaan ban gaye, bharat main hi nahin, balki puri cricket duniya main
 i admire him a lot, i have learned a lot from him and i am saying goodbye to cricket with great memories of his time spent with him and strong friendship
 yah shandaar bhent he
 '' dravid ne kaha ki unhone hameshaa cricket kii khel bhaavana ko barkaraar rakhane kii koshish kii he
 "my attitude to cricket has always been simple - give everything to the team, play with respect and always keep the spirit of the game," he said
 mujhe ummid he ki maine isamen se kuch chijen kii hai
 i failed many times, but i did not stop trying
 isliye main thode dukh ke saath ise chhod rahaa hum, lekin saath hi mujhe garv bhi he
 '' unhone apane lambey kariyar ke dauraan mili samarthan ke liye cricket prashansakon kaa shukriya adaa kiya
 Dravid said, "I would also like to thank Indian cricket fans here and around the world
" cricket bhaagyashaalee he ki aap log iske prashansak hai or main isliye bhaagyashaalee hum ki main aapke saamne khel paaya
 It is an honor to represent India and to represent myself and i have always taken this thing seriously
 ’’ The tour of Australia was a disappointment, with 24 of them
 25 ke ausat se aath pariyon main keval 194 ran banaae
 Even more frustrating was that Dravid, known for his strong technique, was bowled six out of eight times
 australian daure ke baad dravid ke bhavishya par atakalein lagaai ja rahi thim or ab unke sanyas lene ke faisle se nigahen ek anya mahaan ballebaaj vivies lakshmana par lag gai hai, jinke liye bhi yah daura niraashajanak rahaa
 Dravid retired from ODI cricket in England last year and was selected in the ODI squad after making a surprise decision given his brilliant performance (three centuries) during the Test series against England
 'da wal’ ke naam se mashhoor dravid ne june, 1996 main aagaaj kiya tha, haalanki vah indian premier lig ke paanchaven charan main jaipur kii frenchiji rajasthan royles kii aguwai karenge

 Asked how long he took to decide on retirement, Dravid said, "for the last one year i have been assessing after every series
 jab main australia se aayaa, to isamen bhaawanaaon ko dur rakhana chahta tha
 i spoke to Sachin and teammates and everyone was supportive of it
 ’’ dravid ne is baat se inkaar kiya ki australia main kharaab form unke sanyas kaa kaaran tha
 He said, "I don't think my decision was based on the series
 yah kaaphi chizon par vichaar ke baad kiya gaya
 These decisions are based on many things
 ’’ The 39-year-old Dravid became the first player to retire in three aging Indian cricket players — Sachin Tendulkar and VVS Laxman — after a disappointing Test tour to Australia
 dravid ne vishesh rup se bulaai gai press conference main kaha, ‘‘main antarrashtriya or gharelu pratham shrenee cricket se sanyas lene kii ghoshnaa karata hum
 i played my first Test for India 16 years ago and today i feel that the time has come to move forward
 main bharat main ek aise ladke kii tarah hi tha, jo apane desh kii ore se khilne kaa sapana dekhtaa he
 i never thought that my journey would be so long and so perfect
 ’’ Dravid was also accompanied by BCCI president n Srinivasan and former Indian captain Anil Kumble
 unhone kaha, ‘‘koi bhi sapana akele puraa nahin ho saktaa
 i would like to thank those who taught me cricket and trusted me
 bengalooru main mere junior kochon or vibhinn junior rashtriya shiviron ne mujhe cricket ke prati itnaa jununee banaaya
 " dravid ne kaha, ‘‘antarrashtriya str par mere kochon ne meri cricket main sudhaar kiya or jisase mere vyaktitv ko nikharane main madad mili
 Physicians and trainers worked hard to get me fit, which is not an easy task, due to which i continued to play even in the last stages of 30 years
 ’’ unhone kaha, ‘‘bharat main chayankartaaon ko kabhi bhi koi shrey nahin miltaa, lekin unhone kai baar mujh par bharosa jataayaa, balki itnaa bharosa mujhe khud par nahin tha or main iske liye unka shukraguzaar hum
 All the captains i played led, led and inspired me
 sabase zyada main un tiimon kaa shukriya adaa karnaa chaahunga, jinke saath main khelaa
 '' dravid ne kaha ki unki team ke saathiyon ke saath kai shandaar yaaden judi hai, jisamen khel ke kuch mahaan khilaadi bhi shaamil hai
 He said, "I played with the Karnataka team in the early days of my career and those years were very entertaining and learning for me
 ’’ unhone kaha, ‘‘bhartiya team main main us shandaar yug kaa hissaa hokar bhaagyashaalee rahaa, jisamen bharat ne gharelu or videshi sarajameen par kuch behtareen cricket khelaa
 Many teammates became great, not only in India, but in the entire cricket world
 main unki kaaphi prashansa karata hum, maine unase kaaphi kuch siikhaa he or main cricket ko unke saath bitaye gaye samay kii shandaar yaadon or majboot dosti ke saath alavida kah rahaa hum
 This is a great gift
 ’’ Dravid said that he has always tried to maintain the sporting spirit of cricket
 unhone kaha, ‘‘cricket ke liye meraa ravaiya hameshaa saral rahaa he - team ke liye sarvasv do, sammaan se khelo or khel bhaavana ko hameshaa barkaraar rakho
 i hope i did some of this stuff
 main kai baar asafal rahaa, lekin maine koshish karnaa nahin choda
 So i am leaving it with a little sadness, but at the same time i am proud
 ’’ He thanked cricket fans for the support he received during his long career
 dravid ne kaha, ‘‘main yahaan or duniya bhar ke bhartiya cricket prashansakon kaa bhi shukriya karnaa chaahunga
 Cricket is lucky that you guys are fans of this and i am lucky that i got to play in front of you
 bharat kaa pratinidhitiv karnaa or khud kaa pratinidhitiv karnaa sammaan kii baat he or is cheez ko maine hameshaa hi gambhirtha se liya he
 '' australia kaa daura kaaphi niraashajanak rahaa, jisamen unhone 24
 Only 194 runs in eight innings at an average of 25
 isse bhi hatashapurna rahaa ki apni majboot takanic ke liye mashhoor dravid aath main se chah baar bold hue
 There was speculation about Dravid's future after the Australian tour and now his decision to retire has turned his eyes on another legendary batsman, VVS Laxman, for whom the tour was also disappointing
 dravid ne pichley saal england main vanade cricket se sanyas le liya tha or england ke khilaaf test shrunkhlaa ke dauraan unke shandaar pradarshan (teen shatak) ko dekhte hue unhen hairaani bharaa faisla karte hue vanade team main chunaa gaya tha
 Dravid, known as 'the Wall', made his debut in June 1996, though he would lead Jaipur franchise Rajasthan Royals in the fifth leg of the Indian Premier League

 unhone slip kaichon main mark wa ko pahada tha
 Apart from this, he has 196 catches in odis
 yah poochne par ki unhone sanyas par faisla lene main kitna samay liya, to dravid ne kaha, ‘‘pichley ek saal se main prayek shrunkhlaa ke baad akalan kar rahaa hum
 When i arrived from Australia, i wanted to keep the emotions out of it
 maine sachin se or team ke saathiyon se baat kii or sabhi iske samarthan main the
 Dravid denied that poor form in Australia was the reason for his retirement
 unhone kaha, ‘‘mujhe nahin lagata ki meraa yah faisla siries par aadhaarit tha
 This was done after considering a lot of things
 ye faisle kaaphi chizon par aadhaarit hote hai
