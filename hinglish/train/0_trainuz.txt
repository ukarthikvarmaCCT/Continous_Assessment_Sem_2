 '' Another crisis has been deepened in front of Pakistan surrounded on the issue of terrorism
 asia pasic group (APG) ke financial task force main uske blike list hone kaa khatra mandaraane laga he
 FATF is going to have its annual meeting this month and in the report which has come out, it is clearly written that Pakistan has met only one parameter
 chaar par bilkul nahin or baaqi par aanshik taur par usne kaam kiya he
 Significantly, Pakistan running on the gray list has to curb terrorist funding and for this there is an 18-month negotiation period
 asia pasic group kii sidhi hitayat he ki pakistan mani loundering or teror finacing ko rokane te liye kathor qadam uthaae
 Let us tell you that in February 2019, the FATF, which monitors the terrorist funding of countries, gave a sharp warning to Pakistan
 financial ection task force ne kaha tha ki lashkar, jaish or jamaat ud daawa jaise aatanki sanghathanon kii funding par sahi tareeke se lagaam lagane main pakistan naakaamayaab rahaa he
 Pakistan must work to overcome these strategic deficiencies
 pakistan in aatanki sanghathanon- daaesh, al kaayda, jamaat-ud-daawa or usee kaa ang falah-e-insaaniyat foundation, lashkar-e-taiyaba, jaish-e-mohammad, hakkaani network or taliban se jude logon se bane khatre kaa sahi akalan nahin dikhaata
 The FATF had said that Pakistan has shown little progress on the action plan to stop terrorist funding, which was deadline January 2019
 efeetief ne pakistan ko chetavanee dete hue use may 2019 tak target puure karne ke nirdesh die the
 Significantly, countries put on the blacklist are considered to be 'high risk' where international funds given for the betterment of the public are at great risk of reaching terrorist organizations
 agar pakistan blike list main jaataa he to use milane vaali antarrashtriya madad main roak lag jaaegi
 The FATF, formed in 1989 to curb hawala business, is an inland organization
 2001 main iske adhikaar ko badhaakar aatank ke liye paise par roak lagaana bhi kar diya gaya tha

 unhone isse pehle 2012 main katrina caff ko unke berth de par esayuvi car gift kii thi

 BJP president Amit Shah said at a rally in Rajgarh in Sirmaur district in Himachal Pradesh, "let me make one thing clear
" bhaajapa desh main pradhanmantri narendra modi ke netritv main chunaav lard rahi he or himachal pradesh main prem kumaar dhumal ke netritv main
 They are our face in elections
 " ve bole, ''dhoomalji purv mukhyamantri or vipaksh ke netaa hai, 18 disambar ke baad ve mukhyamantri honge
 "prime Minister Modi on Twitter confirmed Shah's announcement
 is tarah aakhirkaar bhaajapa ko himachal main mukhyamantri pad ke liye ek cheharaa mil gaya
 With barely a month's campaign left before the November 9 vote, most people, including many leaders of the state BJP, feel that the announcement was delayed
 sutron ke mutabik, bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah ne 30 aktubar kii der shaam shimla se phone par pradhanmantri se anumati lee ki ve himachal main chunaav ke liye plan-2 (yani mukhyamantri ummidavaar ghoshit karnaa) lagu karenge
 Then, Shah called Dhumal and immediately called Shimla
 dhumal hamirpur se aanan-fanan shimla pahunche
 Shah told him that the party decided that declaring the chief ministerial candidate was necessary for a big win, although it was not allowed to reveal who would be the candidate
 agle din 31 aktubar ko dhumal jab jwalamukhi main chunaav prachaar kar rahe the, usee vakt rajgad kii raily main shah ne dhumal ke naam kaa elaan kiya
 In the speech, Shah also explained why BJP adopted Plan-2
 unhone kaha, '' himachal main congress lagaataar yah puch rahi thi ki bhaajapa kaa siem pratyaashee koun he?"bhaajapa ke ek varisht netaa party ke aantarik moolyankan kaa hawala dete hai jisamen congress ko majboot mana ja rahaa he
 He told India Today, "bjp's victory was certain in the election but we gave Virbhadra Singh and Congress a chance to get stronger
" "modi or shah ne dhumal kaa naam ghoshit karne main itnaa vakt le liya jabaki congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ne 12 aktubar ko chunaav kii adhisuchana se kaaphi pehle hi virbhadra singh ko party ke agle mukhyamantri ke bataur spasht kar diya tha
 The curiosity that has arisen within the BJP in the name of Dhumal suggests that Shah, who generally works according to a well-planned strategy, was selected by force, not on the basis of any strategy, but in terms of local mathematics
 party ke sansadeey board kii aupchaarik baithak kii sahmati liye bina 73 varshiya dhumal ko siem pratyaashee ghoshit karnaa chaunkaata he
 Secondly, in this case the condition of 70 years of age has also been broken
 party ke in kaayadon se hatakar faisle lene kii vajah mishan 2019 he
 According to BJP leaders, it has to be shown that Modi's popularity is not only intact but has increased tremendously
 dhumal ne bhi pratyaashee ghoshit hone ke baad 68 sadasyeey vidhansabha main mishan 50 se badhkar ab 60 siten jeetne kaa bharosa jataayaa he
 Earlier, when Finance Minister Arun Jaitley was issuing the election manifesto in Shimla on October 29, top party leaders were defending the party leadership for not announcing any name as the face of the chief minister and calling it a "strategic matter"
 Were telling kendriya swasthya mantri jagat prakaash nadda ko is pad ke liye dhumal kaa kareebi pratidwandvi mana ja rahaa tha
 Experts believe that Dhumal's selection will be beneficial for the BJP
 dhumal jati sameekaran (rajput) ke lihaaj se bhi feet hai
 Thakurs constitute around 36% of the state's population
 congress ke virbhadra singh bhi thakur hai
 In such a situation, caste arithmetic could be disturbed by making a Brahmin face like Shanta Kumar or JP Nadda as CM candidate
 brahman lagbhag 18 fisadi hai
 But Shah's announcement on 31 October has not affected Virbhadra's enthusiasm
 unke samarthakon kaa kahana he ki dhumal or nadda ke samarthakon ke bich kii ranjish khulkar saamne aa jaaegi
 They are also saying that veteran BJP leader Shantakumar, who has influence in 15 seats in Kangra, will also not be happy with Dhumal's selection
 baharhaal, rajya ek charan ke matdaan kaa parinaam 18 disambar ko aayega

 The word Rafael is not just a disaster for the BJP, but the word has become a problem for those who have nothing to do with this defense deal
 chunavi mausam main congress rafel ke mudde ko lekar bijepi ko gherti rahi he
 Now the matter is in the Supreme Court
 congress apane ghoshnaptr main kah rahi he ki agar vah satta main ai to rafel saude kii jaanch karaayegi, lekin desh ke ek kone main ek gaanv aisa he jo rafel ke tanj se pareshaan he
 However, there are many people in this village who are happy that at least on the pretext of Rafael ship, the name of their village is also becoming famous all over the world
 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav ke safar main aaj tak naksal prabhavit rajya chhattisgarh ke ek aise gaanv main pahunchaa, jiskaa naam hi rafel he
 The name is attached to the scam, so it does not look good till today the team reached Rafael village in Chhattisgarh, Sachin and Sandeep present there stopped looking at the camera
 ve utsukata main paas aae to team ne unase poocha ki unhen kaisaa lagata he jab unke gaanv ke naam kii charchaa hoti he
 Sachin said, 'because of the name of the Rafale plane, the name of our village is constantly coming on TV
 is naam ko ghotaale se joda jaataa he, jo hamen acha nahin lagata he ' vahiin, sandip ne kaha ki rafel kii charchaa ke baad media vaale hamaare gaanv main aa rahe hai
 We like it
 chhattisgarh ke mahasamund loksabhaa kshetra main basaa he gaanvchhota sa gaanv rafel chhattisgarh or urisa kii seemaa par chhattisgarh ke mahasamund loksabhaa kshetra main basaa hua he
 There is no factory for making Rafale in this village, but the workers will definitely be seen making bricks here
 rafel saude se siyasat bhale hi badali ho par is gaanv kii tasviir nahin badali he
 However, under the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana, the village has got a single lane metalled road
 pravesh ke pehle gaanv main anaaj bechney ke liye sarkari dukaan bhi he
 Unemployment and water is a big issue, BJP worker Vivekananda says that there is development in his village
 haalanki pani kii samasya or berogari is gaanv ke liye sabase bada mudda he
 Vivekananda says' There is road-electricity in the village, but there is no drinking water yet and employment is a big problem for youth like us
 ' is bich gaanv ke naam par bolte hue dhaneshwar ne kaha ki is gaanv main naa to bam banataa he naa rafel banataa he balki hamen acha lag rahaa he ki isi bahaane bharat samet america or duusare deshon main hamaare gaanv kaa naam to ho rahaa he
 There are some people who say that now they are proud of this matter
 rafel vivaad se purana he gaanv kaa nampurv sainik suresh kumaar rafel vivaad se naaraaz hai or unhen lagata he ki rafel par lage aaropon ke chalate unke gaanv ko nakaaratmak prachaar mil rahaa he
 Suresh Kumar says that the name of our village is old, but due to the discussion about Rafale aircraft, the name is getting spoiled
 gaanv ke sarpanch kaa bhi kahana he ki is ilaake main hone vaali dhan kii fasal barish par ashrith he kyonki pani kii killat he
 Dhaniram is the sarpanch of Rafael village and he too knows why people are suddenly coming to his village
 haalanki gaanv ke sarpanch bhi pani kii samasya ko lekar chintit hai

 agenda aaj tak ke pehle din ke khaas mehmaan the ranvir singh
 Whoever would have seen his appearance, would have noticed his energy
 aise main ummid yahi thi ki agenda ke apane seshan main ranvir aise hi powerpacked andaaj main dikhenge
 But who knew that when he would make fun of Ramdev in fun, he would have to remove his shoes and do yoga in return
 agenda ke seshan main hua ye ki ranvir apane andaaj main darshakon se mukhaatib the or isi bich baba kii entry ho gai
 When Ranveer called her for a dance, he conditioned her to do yoga
 ise ranvir ne turant maan liya
 When Baba showed his perch of yoga as soon as he came on stage, Ranveer bowed down before him
 iske baad baba ne unako surya namaskara bhi saath karaayaa
 When Baba came down from the stage, Ranveer was getting wet in sweat
 is par ranvir ne unki chutki lee ki unka puraa sharir ro rahaa he! or zyada yoga karte to unki pant bhi fat jaati or vahaan maujuud unki phans yani garlfrends ke aage unka kachra ho jaataa
 On this, Ranveer gave a dialog in his style that do not doubt the power of Babaji, because in 5 minutes, who makes you his devotee, he is called Baba Ramdev! In the meantime, Baba asked Baba Ramdev how to make a six pack, then Baba told him Pranayam
 is hansi-majaak ke daur main ranvir ne baba ramdev ko ofer bhi de diya ki vah patanjali ke brand ambeseder bananaa chaahate hai or is yoga ke liye unako baba kii ore se hamper bhi milanaa chahie
 And he wants to play Baba Ramdev in his biopic

 Explain that according to the plan of Delhi Metro, the increased fare is to be implemented from October 3
 agar badhotaree kii baat karen to isi saal may ke mukaable oktober main metro kaa adhiktam kiraaya do guna ho jayega
 However, DMRC said that the decision to increase the rent is not new and it was decided in May itself that the new fare will be applicable from October 1
 metroca badha hua kiraaya oktober kii shuruyaat se hi lagu hona tha lekin 1 or 2 oktober kii chuttee ke din metro main riyayati kiraaya lagata he
 Due to this, the new fare will be applicable from October 3
 bade hue kiraaye kaa pehla fez lagu hone se pehle metro kaa nunatam kiraaya 8 rupye hota tha, jo ab das rupye hoga
 Whereas the maximum fare was 30 rupees, which was increased to 50 rupees in May and now after October 3 it will be 60 rupees

 Not only this, now for a distance of 5 to 12 kilometers, the fare now is 15 rupees, which will be 20 rupees from October 3
 jabaki itani hi duuri ke liye may ke pehle metro kaa kiraaya mahaz 12 rupye tha
 For a distance of 12 to 21 km, till now the metro charges 30 rupees, which will now be 40 rupees
 jabaki isi duuri ke liye may ke pehle adhiktam 21 rupye kiraaya hota tha
 Traveling in metro from 21 to 32 km from metro now has to pay 40 rupees fare, but from October it will be 50 rupees
 jabaki may ke pehle itani hi duuri ke liye kiraaya 25 rupye hua karata tha
 Now, if you travel more than 32 kilometers, you have to pay 50 rupees as fare, but from October the same fare will be 60 rupees, whereas before May it used to be 30 rupees
 kam duuri tak safar karne waalon par bhi kiraaya badhottaree kii maradilli metro ne kiraaye ke slab kam kar die he, isse bhi kam duuri tak safar karne waalon par bhi kiraaya badhottaree kii zyada maar padegi, jabaki adhiktam kiraaya doguna ho hi gaya he

 Then one day suddenly he felt a strong smell in the room
 puraa ghar chaan maaraa
 But it was not known where the stink was coming from
 aakhir main usne bed se gadda hataaya or bed kaa woox kholaa
 a woman's body was found inside the box
 wo puri paanch raat usee laash ke upar so rahaa tha
 The matter is related to Gurgaon close to Delhi which is now called Gurugram
 20 janvari 2019 ravivaargurugram ke sector-46 main rajesh or uski patni apane bacchon ke saath rahete hai
 On that day, there was a fight between Rajesh and his wife Babita in front of the children at night
 rajesh ne babitha ko gusse main jaan se maarane kii dhamkee tak de di thi
 21 January 2019 Monday, morning time without informing anyone in the house
 rajesh patni babita ko lekar nikal gaya
 His children were sleeping at home except for his elder daughter
 jisane un donon ko ghar se baahar jate dekha
 On January 21, 2019, Monday morning, the driver Rajesh had a key to his owner Dinesh's car besides his house
 chunki dinesh har shanivaar-ravivaar gaanv chalaa jaataa he
 So Rajesh came here to his house with wife Babita
 donon main phir jhagada hua
 And it is believed that this time Rajesh angrily killed Babita by strangling her
 rajesh se patni kaa katl to ho gaya tha magar use samaj nahin aayaa ki wo babitha kii laash ko kahaan thikaane lagaae
 In fear of being caught, he kept Babita's body inside this bed box in Dinesh's house and escaped by locking it in the house
 pehali raat- 21 janvari 2019, somvarsomvaar kii raat rajesh kaa maalik dinesh gaanv se lautaa
 Seeing the house locked, he went straight to his tea shop near Sector 46, Gurugram

 He dialed Rajesh's phone, he was also coming off
 raat ko kaam khatm karke duusari chaabi se usne ghar kaa daravaaza kholaa or hameshaa kii tarah apni bed par jaakar so gaya
 Unaware that a corpse is kept inside the same bed
 duusari raat- 22 janvari 2019 mangalvaarrat ke vaqt hameshaa kii tarah dinesh subah ghar se niklaa tha or raat ko waapas lautaa
 Babita's body was still in bed
 magar dinesh anjaan tha
 He then slept on the same bed
 subah hui or wo taiyaar hokar apni chaay kii dukaan par chalaa gaya
 Third night - 23 January 2019, Dinesh returns home during Wednesday night
 babitha kii laash abhi bhi usee ke bed box main thi
 But today, he was surprised that Rajesh has gone, not knowing
 or kyon uskaa phone bhi nahin lag rahaa he
 Today he was not even able to sleep
 ek ajeeb si gandh aaj uske kamare kaa maahaul atapata bana rahi thi
 He thought it might stink from the drain
 lihaaza use nazarandaaz karke wo so gaya
 But in the morning, he went to Rajesh's house
 jahaan use pataa chalaa ki rajesh or babita kaa somvaar se hi kuch ata pataa nahin chal rahaa he
 Fourth night - 24 January 2019, it was Thursday night
 aaj dinesh kaaphi thakaa hua tha
 So i lay on the bed as soon as i arrived
 laash abhi bhi vahiin thi jahaan rajesh use chipa gaya tha
 That is, inside Dinesh's bed
 magar aaj uske kamare main badboo thodi or tej ho gai thi
 But due to exhaustion, Dinesh somehow went to sleep
 or subah hote hi apane kaam par nikal gaya
 The fifth night - 25 January 2019, when Dineshe returned home again on Friday, there was a very strong smell in the house today
 badboo bardaasht ke baahar thi
 Dinesh thought the rat might have died
 pareshaan hokar wo apane ghar kii talaashi lene laga
 When he could not see anything, he removed the mattress of his bed near the window
 jaise hi dinesh ne is box ko kholaa
 The strong smell made him angry
 wo peeche kii taraf gira
 And after closing the box, ran towards the nearest police station
 police maukey par pahunchi
 As soon as the box of the bed was opened, the police also became conscious
 laash ko is bertib tareeke se rakhaa gaya tha ki wo naa sirf akad chuki thi
 Rather, it was also rotten after five days

 There was an attempt to squeeze both the legs of the corpse into the same part of the bed
 police ne laash ko box se nikaalkar postmortem ke liye bheja diya

 bhartiya cricket board ne cricket main technology ke istemaal par apana kadaa ravaiya aakhirkaar chhod diya
 The BCCI has agreed to implement the revised format of the Disputed Decision Review System (DRS) compulsorily in all international matches on its terms at the ICC annual meeting
 diares ke sanshodhit swaroop ko baithak ke duusare din isisi mukhya kaaryakariyon kii samiti (siisi) ne sarvasammati se manjuuri di
 It will have hot spot technology but will not have a hawk, which indicates the direction of the ball
 iskaa matlab he ki diares main elbeadblyoo ke faisle shaamil nahin honge
 The mandatory terms and conditions of DRS will now include 'thermal Imaging' and 'sound Technology'
 pehle gend kii disha pataa karne ke liye upyog main laayaa jane vaala ‘bal trekar’ bhi isamen shaamil tha lekin ise hataane par sahmati ban gayi he
 The new format of DRS has been sent by the ICC CEC to the Executive Board for approval, which will put a final seal on it tomorrow
 hot spot, jo ki ek ‘thermal imaging technology’ he, ab cricket maichon main uplabdh rahegaa or use diares main anivaary bana diya gaya he
 They are mainly used for close catches and the ball carrying the edge of the bat
 bisisiai ne kaha ki vah sanshodhit diares par sahamat ho gaya he jisamen hot spot to hoga lekin ball trekar nahin
 He said that the ICC Chief Executive Committee has agreed that 'child tracker' can be used in bilateral chains with the consent of both boards
 board ke sachiv or bhavi adhyaksh en shrinivasana ne bayaan main kaha, ‘bisisiai nirnay lene kii pranali main technology ko shaamil karne par sahamat ho gaya he
 It includes infra red cameras and audio tracking equipment
 ’ bayaan ke anusaar, ‘bisisiai hameshaa khel kii bhalaai ke liye technology ko apnaane kii ichha jaahir karata rahaa he
 However the current ball tracking technology on which DRS is based is not acceptable to the board
 ’ bisisiai ne kaha, ‘honkong main chal rahi isisi siisi baithak main bisisiai ke drushtikon ko samarthan kiya gaya
 The CEC also decided to use technology to find the direction of the ball to make decisions with it but it would depend on the bilateral arrangement between the participating teams
 ’bayaan ke anusaar, ‘siisi ne van de main asafal refral kii sankhya do se ghataakar ek karne kii cricket samiti kii siforeeshon ko manjuuri de di he
 'this decision means that India has agreed to use DRS again in a bilateral series for the first time since 2008
 is tarah se bharat ke england daure main iskaa upyog kiya jayega
 However in this series it will be used without the Hawk Eye child tracker which means it will not include LBW decisions
 bhartiya cricket board shuru se hi diares kaa virodh karata rahaa he
 He believes that this is not 100 percent correct
 senior ballebaaj sachin tendulkar ne bhi kaha ki yadi diares main hot spot technology ko shaamil kiya jaataa he to yah adhik sweekaarya hoga

 # sunandatharoor nakebandi or no entry point par police kii avaidh vasuuli koi nai baat nahin he, lekin jaipur main janata ke gusse ke aage rajasthan police ko apane 2 constablon ko barkhaast kar unhen arest karnaa padaa he
 The public made a complete video of the policemen forcibly recovering the money and made that video viral
 jab baat police tak pahunchi to aanan-fanan main in pulisavaalon par karrwai kii gai
 It is being told that people of extortion policemen have also killed
 jaipur main ajmer road ke 200 feet express chauraahey par ek danpar vishwakarma road se aa rahaa tha
 When the policemen saw him, he followed him for an 11 km in an auto
 police vaale danpar rukvaa kar 15 sau rupee rishwat maangane lage
 Seeing all this, the people present there gathered at the crossroads and started investigating the two policemen and got Rs 23,680 out of their pockets
 jab hangaamaa machaa to police waalon ne paisa naale main phenk diya
 The public caught these two and informed the Muralipura police station and the police came from there and brought them to the police station
 danpar chalaane vaale tonk ke kaluram gurjar kii report par in donon ko giraftaar kiya gaya he
 DCP Traffic Rahul Prakash himself reached the spot and suspended Constable Tejmal Baja and Homeguard Tarun Saini
 donon police line main tainaat hai
 He had no duty here
 magar yah entry point maangane ke naam par rishwat le rahe the
 Taking this seriously, Rajasthan Police has suspended all five policemen posted at the Ajmer bypass intersection
 darasal, kaaphi samay se logon kii shikaayat mil rahi thi ki yahaan par tainaat police vaale vasuuli karte hai
 Last year, Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi called Narendra Modi's government a 'suit-boot government'
 iske baad se hi vipaksh lagaataar centre sarkaar ko udyopatiyon kii hitaishi bataate ai he, lekin somvaar ko pesh aam bajet main modi sarkaar ne is ore apane daag dhone kii koshish kii he
 PM Modi himself has described Jaitley's budget as the budget focused on village development
 yani kahin na kahin rahul kii baat bijepi ko aisi chubhi he ki sarkaar ne sootadhari jagat kii apekshaaon par boot maarane kaa kaam kiya he
 It is also worth noting that the Prime Minister had given initial indications about the budget at a farmers rally recently
 unhone kaha tha ki 2022 tak unki sarkaar kisaanon kii aay ko doguna karne kaa lakshya rakhti he
 In the general budget, Jaitley has worked to carry forward this vision of Modi
 kisaanon ke liye bajet main 25 hajaar karod rupee kaa aavanton kiya gaya he, jabaki gramin ilaakon main moolbhoot dhaanche se bhi sarkaar ne sarokaar dikhaaya he
 Nabard has been given an irrigation fund of twenty thousand crore rupees to help the farmers in Kokheti, and an amount of Rs 17000 crore is also in the budget for irrigation scheme
 isi tarahakrushi ke liye alagase 35984 karod rupee kaa fund he, jabaki gaanv main mazdooron ko rojgaar muhaiyaa karwaane ke lihaaj se manaregaa ke tahat 5 lakh talab banavaane kii bhi ghoshnaa kii gai he
 Unsatisfied the industry On Sunday, big giants of the industry and institutions like FICCI had raised a lot of expectations from the budget
 FICCI se jude ashok kajariya ne kaha he ki vartmaan aarthik paridrishy kii maang he ki saarvajanik kharch par jor dene ke saath hi nijee nivesh main teji laane vaali nitiyon ko badhaava diya jaae
 Whereas companies making IT and telecom hardware expected that the government would make a big announcement to promote domestic manufacturing in the budget
 sarkaar kii najar kheti or utpaadan pardusri ore, somvaar ko arun jetali ne apane bajet bhaashan or uske baad bhi saaf kaha ki sarkaar kii pehali praathamikta desh ke gaanv hai
 That is why organic farming in 5 lakh acres has been announced in the budget, then Rs 500 crore has been announced to encourage production of pulses crops
 desh main kisaanon ke liye karj ko bhi aasaan banane ke saath hi is ore 9 lakh karod ke intjaam kii baat kii gai he
 While there is an allocation of Rs 5500 crore for crop insurance
 yani jo kuch ummiden udyog jagat ko thim, sarkaar ne suut kii na sunakar gaanv par hi dhyaan lagaaya he
 Opponent also admitted that the opposition of lobjp and the leader of the National Conference close to the Congress, Omar Abdullah, wrote the same after the budget on Twitter, 'the government and Jaitley cleverly made the opposition's work difficult by ignoring the benefits of the suitbutt
 Have given
 'by not focusing the benefits of # unionbudget2016on the # suitbootpeople@arunjaitleyhas cleverly made the opposition's job a bit tougher
 - Omar Abdullah (@abdullah_omar) February 29, 2016 Jaitley's Potliom Budget 2016-17 for the farmers has said that the Finance Minister has said to focus on farming in disaster areas
 sarkaar iske liye suukhaagrast ilaakon ke liye dinadayal antyoday yojana lekar ai he to gram panchayaton ko 2
 a fund of 87 crore will also be given
 sinchai par khaas dhyaan dete hue 1 may 2018 tak sabhi gaanv main bijli kaa lakshya nirdhaarit kiya gaya he
 It has been said to spend 8500 crores on this item
 sattar saal pehle jab ek bhayanak vishwa yuddh kaa ant hua tha
 Then a new hope was born in the form of this organization
 aaj ham phir maanavtaa kii nai disha tay karne ke liye yahan ekatrit hue hai
 i heartily congratulate the Secretary General for organizing this important summit
 Agenda– 2030 kaa vijan mahatvakankshi he or uddeshy utane hi vyapak hai
 It gives priority to problems that have been going on for the last several decades
 saath hi saath yah saamaajik, aarthik or paryaavaran ke vishay main hamaari paripakv hoti hui soch ko bhi darshata he
 It is a pleasure that we are all dreaming of a world free from poverty
 hamaare nirdhaarit lakshyon main garibi unmoolan sab se upar he
 1 in the world today
 3 billion log garibi kii dayaneey jindagi jeene ke liye majaboor he
 The question before us is not just how to meet the needs of the poor
 or na hi yah keval garibo ke astitv or sammaan tak hi simit prashn he
 Also, there is no question of assuming that it is just our moral responsibility
 agar ham sab kaa saajha sankalp he kii – - May the world be peaceful - vyavastha nyaaypurna ho - and development be sustainable to garibi ke rahete yah kabhi bhi sambhav nahin hoga
 Therefore, it is a sacred responsibility of all of us to eradicate poverty
 bharat ke mahaan vichaarak pandit dinadayal upaadhyaay ke vichaaro kaa centre antyoday rahaa he
 UN Agenda 2030 also brings the smell of Antyodaya
 bharat dinadayal ji ke janmasati varsh ko manaane kii taiyaari kar rahaa he, tab yah nishchit hi ek sukhad sanyog he
 India welcomes the importance given to climate change and sustainable consumption under environmental goals
 aaj vishwa Island States kii chintaa kar rahaa he or aise rashtron ke bhavishya par dhyaan kendrit karata he, yah swaagat yogya he
 And setting different targets on their ecosystem, i consider it an important step
 main Blue Revolution kaa pakshdhar hum, jisamen hamaare chote- chote Islands rashtron kii raksha evam samruddhi, saamudrik sampatti kaa nayochit upyog or nila aasmaan, ye tino baaten sammalit he
 It is a matter of satisfaction for the people of India that there are many similarities between the path of development that India has chosen and the Sustainable Development Goals proposed by the UN
 bharat aaazaad hua tab se garibi se mukti paane kaa sapana ham sabane sanjoya he
 We have chosen the path to defeat poverty by empowering the poor
 shiksha evam Skill Development, yah hamaari praathamikta he
 It is our endeavor that the poor get education and have skills in their hands
 hamane nirdhaarit samay seemaa main Financial Inclusion par mission-mode main kaam kiya he
 180 million new bank accounts were opened
 yah garibon kaa sabase bada empowerment he
 The benefits of the poor are directly reaching the account
 garibon ko beemaa yojanaon kaa sidhe laabh mili, isaki mahatvakankshi yojana aage bad rahi he
 Very few people in India have pension facilities
 garibon tak pension kii suvidha pahunche isliye pension yojanao ke vistaar kaa kaam kiya he
 Today, the poorest of the poor have a desire to fight the fight against poverty
 nagarikon ke man main sapane sach hone kaa vishwaas paidaa hua he
 Discussion of economic development in the world has been limited to only two sectors
 yaa to Public sector kii charchaa hoti he yaa Private sector kii charchaa hoti he
 We have focused on a new sector and that is the personal sector
 Public sector, Private sector or Personal sector
 For India, the personal sector means that individual enterprise, which has micro finance, innovation, new movement like start-up
 sabake liye awaas, bijli, pani, shiksha, swasth or swatchta hamaari praathamikta hai
 All these are mandatory for a dignified life
 in lakshyon ko praapt karne ke liye ek thos yojana or ek nishchit samay seemaa tay kii gai he
 Women's empowerment is an important part of our development programs
 jisame hamane ‘beti bachaao – beti padhaao’ ise ghar ghar kaa mantra bana diya he
 We are making our farms more fertile and well connected to the market
 saath hi prakritik anischitataaon ke chalate kisaanon ke jokhimon ko kam karne ke liye anek kadam uthaaye ja rahe hai
 We are reviving manufacturing, improving the service sector
 Infrastructure ke kshetra main ham abhootpurv str par nivesh kar rahe hai or apane shaharon ko smart, sustainable tathaa jeevant development centers ke rup main viksit kar rahe hai
 We are committed to ensure that our path towards prosperity is sustainable
 is katibaddhta kaa mul nishchit rup se hamaari parampara or samskruti se jude hona he
 But it also shows our commitment to the future
 mai us samskruti kaa pratinidhitiv karata hoon jahaan dharti ko maan kehete he or maanate hai
 Vedas declare - "mata bhoomi: putro ahan pruthivya" This earth is our mother and we are its sons
 hamaari yojanaayen mahatvakankshi or uddeshypurna hai, jaise : • Development of 175 GW (GW) renewable energy capacity over the next 7 years • Energy effeciency par bal • Large scale tree planting program • koyale par vishesh tex Improvement in transport system • shaharon or nadiyon kii safai
 • Waste to wealth movement maanavtaa ke chathe hisse kaa sustainable development samast vishwa ke liye tathaa hamaari sundar vasundhara ke liye atyant mahatvapurn he
 Surely this world will be a world with fewer challenges and wider expectations
 jo apni safalataa ko lekar adhik aashwast hogi
 We will share our success and resources with others
 bhartiya parampara main puure vishwa ko ek parivaar ke rup main dekha jaataa he
 "udarcharitnam Naam Tu Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam" udaar buddhi waalon ke liye to sampoorn sansar ek parivaar hota he, kutumb he Today, India is discharging its responsibility as a development partner with small island states located in the Atlantic Ocean from Asia and Africa and the Pacific Ocean
 Sustainable development sabhi deshon ke liye rashtriya uttardaayitv kaa vishay he
 They also require options for policy formulation
 aaj ham yahan sanyukt raashtra main isliye hai, kyonki ham sabhi yah maanate hai ki antarrashtriya saajhedaari anivaary rup se hamaare sabhi prayaason ke centre main honi chahie
 Whether it is development or climate change challenge
 hamaare samuhik prayaason kaa siddhant he – common but differentiated responsibilities
 If we worry about climate change, then somewhere there is the smell of securing our personal happiness
 lekin yadi ham climate justice kii baat karte he to garibo ko practik aapadaao main surakshit rakhane kaa ek samvedansheel sankalp ubhar kar aata he
 In dealing with the challenge of climate change, there is a need to emphasize solutions that enable us to achieve our objectives
 hamen ek vaishvik jan-bhagidaari kaa nirmaan karnaa hoga
 On the basis of which we can make clean and renewable energy accessible by using technology, innovation and finance
 hamen apni jeevanstyli main bhi badlaav karne kii aavashyaktaa he, taaki urja par hamaari nirbharta kam ho or ham sustainable consumption kii ore bade
 There is also a need to start a Global Education Program
 jo hamaari agali peedi ko prakruti ke rakshan evam sanvardhan ke liye taiyaar kare
 i hope that developed countries will fulfill their financial commitments for development and climate change, without in anyway putting both under the same head
 main yah bhi aashaa karata hoon ki technology facilitation mechanism, technology or innovation ko vishwa ke kalyaan kaa madhyam banane main safal hoga
 It will not be limited to private profit alone
 jaisaa ki ham dekh rahe hai, duuri ke kaaran chunautiyon se chhutkaaraa nahin he
 They can also stand up from the shadow of ongoing conflict and absence in remote countries
 samoochaa vishwa ek dusre se judaa he, ek dusre par nirbhar he or ek dusre se sambandhit he
 Therefore, our international partnerships also have to keep the welfare of the entire humanity at the center
 suraksha parishad samet sanyukt raashtra main bhi sudhaar anivaary he
 So that it can maintain its reliability and justification
 saath hi vyapak pratinidhitiv ke dwaara ham apane uddeshyon kii prapti adhik prabhavi rup se kar sakenge
 Let us create a world where every living being just feels safe, has opportunities and is respected
 ham apni bhavi peedi ke liye apane paryaavaran ko or bhi behatar sthiti main chhod kar jaaen
 Surely there could be no greater purpose than this
 parantu yah bhi sach he kii koi bhi uddeshy isse adhik chunauteepurn bhi nahin he
 Today, at the age of 70, all of us in the United Nations are expected to overcome this challenge through our wisdom, experience, generosity, warm-heartedness, skill and technology
 mujhe drudh vishwaas he ki ham aisa kar sakenge

 or na hi yah keval garibo ke astitv or sammaan tak hi simit prashn he
 Also, there is no question of assuming that it is just our moral responsibility
 agar ham sab kaa saajha sankalp he kii – - May the world be peaceful - vyavastha nyaaypurna ho - and development be sustainable to garibi ke rahete yah kabhi bhi sambhav nahin hoga
 Therefore, it is a sacred responsibility of all of us to eradicate poverty

 We have chosen the path to defeat poverty by empowering the poor

 It is our endeavor that the poor get education and have skills in their hands

 The benefits of the poor are directly reaching the account

 Today, the poorest of the poor have a desire to fight the fight against poverty
 nagarikon ke man main sapane sach hone kaa vishwaas paidaa hua he
 Discussion of economic development in the world has been limited to only two sectors
 yaa to Public sector kii charchaa hoti he yaa Private sector kii charchaa hoti he
 We have focused on a new sector and that is the personal sector
 Public sector, Private sector or Personal sector
 For India, the personal sector means that individual enterprise, which has micro finance, innovation, new movement like start-up
 sabake liye awaas, bijli, pani, shiksha, swasth or swatchta hamaari praathamikta hai
 All these are mandatory for a dignified life

 Women's empowerment is an important part of our development programs

 We are making our farms more fertile and well connected to the market
 saath hi prakritik anischitataaon ke chalate kisaanon ke jokhimon ko kam karne ke liye anek kadam uthaaye ja rahe hai
 We are reviving manufacturing, improving the service sector
 Infrastructure ke kshetra main ham abhootpurv str par nivesh kar rahe hai or apane shaharon ko smart, sustainable tathaa jeevant development centers ke rup main viksit kar rahe hai
 We are committed to ensure that our path towards prosperity is sustainable

 But it also shows our commitment to the future

 Vedas declare - "mata bhoomi: putro ahan pruthivya" This earth is our mother and we are its sons

 • Waste to wealth movement maanavtaa ke chathe hisse kaa sustainable development samast vishwa ke liye tathaa hamaari sundar vasundhara ke liye atyant mahatvapurn he
 Surely this world will be a world with fewer challenges and wider expectations

 We will share our success and resources with others

 Sustainable development sabhi deshon ke liye rashtriya uttardaayitv kaa vishay he
 They also require options for policy formulation
 aaj ham yahan sanyukt raashtra main isliye hai, kyonki ham sabhi yah maanate hai ki antarrashtriya saajhedaari anivaary rup se hamaare sabhi prayaason ke centre main honi chahie
 Whether it is development or climate change challenge
 hamaare samuhik prayaason kaa siddhant he – common but differentiated responsibilities
 If we worry about climate change, then somewhere there is the smell of securing our personal happiness
 lekin yadi ham climate justice kii baat karte he to garibo ko practik aapadaao main surakshit rakhane kaa ek samvedansheel sankalp ubhar kar aata he
 In dealing with the challenge of climate change, there is a need to emphasize solutions that enable us to achieve our objectives
 hamen ek vaishvik jan-bhagidaari kaa nirmaan karnaa hoga
 On the basis of which we can make clean and renewable energy accessible by using technology, innovation and finance
 hamen apni jeevanstyli main bhi badlaav karne kii aavashyaktaa he, taaki urja par hamaari nirbharta kam ho or ham sustainable consumption kii ore bade
 There is also a need to start a Global Education Program
 jo hamaari agali peedi ko prakruti ke rakshan evam sanvardhan ke liye taiyaar kare
 i hope that developed countries will fulfill their financial commitments for development and climate change, without in anyway putting both under the same head
 main yah bhi aashaa karata hoon ki technology facilitation mechanism, technology or innovation ko vishwa ke kalyaan kaa madhyam banane main safal hoga
 It will not be limited to private profit alone
 jaisaa ki ham dekh rahe hai, duuri ke kaaran chunautiyon se chhutkaaraa nahin he
 They can also stand up from the shadow of ongoing conflict and absence in remote countries
 samoochaa vishwa ek dusre se judaa he, ek dusre par nirbhar he or ek dusre se sambandhit he
 Therefore, our international partnerships also have to keep the welfare of the entire humanity at the center
 suraksha parishad samet sanyukt raashtra main bhi sudhaar anivaary he
 So that it can maintain its reliability and justification
 saath hi vyapak pratinidhitiv ke dwaara ham apane uddeshyon kii prapti adhik prabhavi rup se kar sakenge
 Let us create a world where every living being just feels safe, has opportunities and is respected
 ham apni bhavi peedi ke liye apane paryaavaran ko or bhi behatar sthiti main chhod kar jaaen
 Surely there could be no greater purpose than this
 parantu yah bhi sach he kii koi bhi uddeshy isse adhik chunauteepurn bhi nahin he
 Today, at the age of 70, all of us in the United Nations are expected to overcome this challenge through our wisdom, experience, generosity, warm-heartedness, skill and technology

 Everyone should be happy, all should be healthy, all should see welfare, no one has any kind of grief
 isi mangal kaamana ke saath aap sab kaa bahut bahut dhanyavad! "udarcharitnam Naam Tu Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam" udaar buddhi waalon ke liye to sampoorn sansar ek parivaar hota he, kutumb he Today, India is discharging its responsibility as a development partner with small island states located in the Atlantic Ocean from Asia and Africa and the Pacific Ocean
 Sustainable development sabhi deshon ke liye rashtriya uttardaayitv kaa vishay he
 They also require options for policy formulation
 aaj ham yahan sanyukt raashtra main isliye hai, kyonki ham sabhi yah maanate hai ki antarrashtriya saajhedaari anivaary rup se hamaare sabhi prayaason ke centre main honi chahie
 Whether it is development or climate change challenge
 hamaare samuhik prayaason kaa siddhant he – common but differentiated responsibilities
 If we worry about climate change, then somewhere there is the smell of securing our personal happiness
 lekin yadi ham climate justice kii baat karte he to garibo ko practik aapadaao main surakshit rakhane kaa ek samvedansheel sankalp ubhar kar aata he
 In dealing with the challenge of climate change, there is a need to emphasize solutions that enable us to achieve our objectives
 hamen ek vaishvik jan-bhagidaari kaa nirmaan karnaa hoga
 On the basis of which we can make clean and renewable energy accessible by using technology, innovation and finance
 hamen apni jeevanstyli main bhi badlaav karne kii aavashyaktaa he, taaki urja par hamaari nirbharta kam ho or ham sustainable consumption kii ore bade
 There is also a need to start a Global Education Program
 jo hamaari agali peedi ko prakruti ke rakshan evam sanvardhan ke liye taiyaar kare
 i hope that developed countries will fulfill their financial commitments for development and climate change, without in anyway putting both under the same head
 main yah bhi aashaa karata hoon ki technology facilitation mechanism, technology or innovation ko vishwa ke kalyaan kaa madhyam banane main safal hoga
 It will not be limited to private profit alone
 jaisaa ki ham dekh rahe hai, duuri ke kaaran chunautiyon se chhutkaaraa nahin he
 They can also stand up from the shadow of ongoing conflict and absence in remote countries
 samoochaa vishwa ek dusre se judaa he, ek dusre par nirbhar he or ek dusre se sambandhit he
 Therefore, our international partnerships also have to keep the welfare of the entire humanity at the center
 suraksha parishad samet sanyukt raashtra main bhi sudhaar anivaary he
 So that it can maintain its reliability and justification
 saath hi vyapak pratinidhitiv ke dwaara ham apane uddeshyon kii prapti adhik prabhavi rup se kar sakenge
 Let us create a world where every living being just feels safe, has opportunities and is respected
 ham apni bhavi peedi ke liye apane paryaavaran ko or bhi behatar sthiti main chhod kar jaaen
 Surely there could be no greater purpose than this
 parantu yah bhi sach he kii koi bhi uddeshy isse adhik chunauteepurn bhi nahin he
 Today, at the age of 70, all of us in the United Nations are expected to overcome this challenge through our wisdom, experience, generosity, warm-heartedness, skill and technology
 mujhe drudh vishwaas he ki ham aisa kar sakenge

 'dainiel ne saal 2006 main pehali baar 007 sikret agent kaa role adaa kiya tha

 input:ians In the ODI series, Team India hosts proved to be twenty over Sri Lanka
 aaj shaam milegaa bees kaa bos banane kaa mauka jab pallekale main khelaa jaayegaa donon deshon kii bich is series kaa iklauta tii-20 match
 Next month, World T20 will be played in Sri Lanka itself, which means that today Team India is getting a great chance to win the dress rehearsal
 vaise lanka ke khilaaf india ko mahaj ek tii 20 match khelnaa he aise main team kii najar is match se zyada us trophy par he jo 5 saal pehle inke kabje main thi
 After becoming the first T20 champion in 2007, the performance graph of Team India has dropped continuously in this format
 2009 or 2010 tii-20 world championships main donon baar semifinal se pehle nock out hone ke baad team india ko kaaphi dhakka bhi laga
 But Dhoni once again has a young team and the conditions in Lanka also like him a lot
 50-50 main world champion banane ke baad bhi team kii gaadi patari se utarane lagi thi lekin sijan kii pehle hi siries main dhamaakedaar jeet ke saath team india world rankig main number 2 par pahunch gai he
 The message is clear, now the team is ready to take a new breakthrough
 aise main ab ek baar phir tii-20 main dabadabaa banane kaa mauka he
 The World T20 trophy was unveiled before the only match
 vishwa khitaab kii ladaai to sitambar main hogi
 Till then why not win the rehearsal in this dress rehearsal in Pallekle
 pakistan kii punjab sarkaar ne praathmik skulon se shiksha ke madhyam ke rup main angrej ko hataa diya he
 Here Urdu has been implemented once again
 iske peeche ekadam alag hi tark die ja rahe hai
 The government says that most of the time of students and teachers was wasted in translation
 bataa den ki march 2020 se shuru hone vaale agle shaikshanik satr se soobe ke 60,000 se adhik public skulon main ye nayaa nirdesh lagu hoga
 The Chief Minister of Punjab has just implemented this rule
 media reports main aisa daawa he ki 2020 tak ye pakistan ke punjab praant ke takreeban sabhi skulon main lagu ho jayega
 Punjab Chief Minister has decided to return Urdu, it is said about him that allegedly Punjab Chief Minister Osman Bujdar cannot read or write English
 punjab ke public skulon main angreji ko pichhali piemail-en sarkaar dwaara britain ke department for international deveopment or british council ke paraamarsh se pesh kiya gaya tha
 Criticism of the decision being made on all sides, this decision is facing sharp criticism from the Punjab government as well as Pakistan tehreek-e-insaf and Prime Minister Imran Khan everywhere
 shikshavidon ne to yahaan tak kaha he ki ye faisla desh ko pashaan yug kii ore waapas le saktaa he
 Educationists are reminding them of the promise when the Punjab government said that when their government comes, they will change the curriculum from madrasa to private, public and all types of schools
 vahiin bujadaar ne kaha ki pakistan taharik-e-insaaf ke ghoshnaptr main spasht rup se kaha gaya he ki shiksha kaa madhyam praathmik str par urdu hoga
 To support his decision, he claimed that the provincial education department conducted a survey of students, parents and teachers in 22 districts through instruction and about 85 percent of the respondents in each category voted in favor of Urdu
 alag vishay ke rup main padhai jaaegi angrejimukhyamantri ne kaha he ki angreji ko ek alag vishay ke rup main padhaayaa jayega
 Interestingly, Punjab government's enrollment campaigns are failing to meet the target and a large number of children are out of schools
 ek sarkari surveykshan ke anusaar, adhikansh mata-pita apane bacchon ko public skulon ke bajaay angreji madhyam ke nijee skulon main bhejne main ruchi rakhte hai
 On such a reactiontwitter found on Twitter, Imad Qureshi said that your own children will go to Cambridge schools and later to the US and UK for education and poor children will study in Urdu
 yadi aap is duniya main pratispardhaa karnaa chaahate hai to pehali kaksha se angreji padhaanaa shuru karnaa anivaary he
 Please discard your retarded thoughts

 unke paas se nashili goliyaan or ek dawa bhi mili
 Normally, in order to take the old hitchhiker in trust, the couple would ask for the address of his village and then would talk about himself going to the same village
 donon vaise to punjab main fazilka tehsil ke rahane vaale hai, lekin unhone sari vaaradaaten rajasthan ke ganganagar yaa yahaan aane-jane ke raste main hi anjaam deen
 The reason for doing this? Hear from Ashok, "people here are naive and then nobody recognizes us here
