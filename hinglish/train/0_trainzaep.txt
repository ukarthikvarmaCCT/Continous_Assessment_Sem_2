 Delhi is going to witness Anna's movement once again

 Although the BJP has emerged as the second party there, it is not in a position to form a government on its own
 yahi halamufti mohammad said kii party pidipika he, jo pehle number par to he lekin sarkaar banane ke liye jodidar kii talash kar rahi he
 Experts believe that if these two form a government together, the state will benefit
 lekin isamen bahut se pech hai
 Let us see what are the five issues that are preventing both of them from forming a government
 1
 The ideology of PDP and BJP are different
 chunaav main donon ek duusare ke khilaaf lade or party bijepi kii hinduvadi vichaardhaara se ittefaq nahin rakhti
 If the party shows a change in its ideology in the case of Jammu and Kashmir, then it can support it
 2
 PDP is more inclined towards Congress
 lekin pidipi kii samasya he ki congress ko rajya main khaarij kiya ja chukaa he or uske prati logon main koi jhukaav nahin he
 The party will get nothing by joining him
 agar bijepi use yah bharosa de ki party use vikaas ke liye bina shart fund degi, to bijepi ke saath sarkaar ban sakati he
 3
 bijepi neshnal conference ko puri tarah nakaar de
 If she shows interest in leaving him and forming a government, then there can be a talk with the PDP
 4
 If the BJP assures the PDP that it will allow Mufti Mohammed Sayeed to remain the chief minister of the state for six years, the matter may go ahead
 pidipi chaahati he ki said vahaan bina roak-tok apana kaarykaal puraa karen
 5
 bijepi ko yah dhyaan rakhana hoga ki aresas, bajrang dal jaisi partiyaan kashmir kaa maahaul na kharaab karen
 Jammu and Kashmir is a very sensitive state in terms of religion
 yahaan agar party sayanm se kaam legi to pidipi uskaa saath degi
 For this, PM Modi and Amit Shah will have to take initiative themselves
 agar ye paanch baaten puri hoti hai to jammu-kashmir main pidipi-bijepi kii sarkaar ban sakati he
 If the BJP did not join the government, it would harm the people of Jammu, because they voted for them in bulk and they also want development

 The way of campaigning through auto is new

 shanivaar raat rithik roshan ek tivi intervyuu main khulkar saamne aae or kangana sang apane rishton ke bare main baat kii
 In the interview, he said that he had no relationship with Kangana
 kai cilebs is mudde par saamne aae or rithik kaa saath diya
 Farhan Akhtar's name has also been added to this list
 unhone fasebuk par ek letters share kiya he
 He has written- Today i read an open letter, written by a man for a woman
 yah vivaad chal to kaaphi dinon se rahaa he, lekin jahaan tak meri jaankaree he is shaks ne pehali baar apni baat saamne rakhi he
 i do not have the right to say who is right and who is wrong, but i think it is necessary to comment on these incidents
 kangana vivaad par bole rithik- sagaai to bhul jaao, aamane-saamne bhi kabhi baat nahin huibahuton kii tarah mujhe bhi lagata he ki hamaare samaaj main zyaadaatar mahilaon ko dabaaya jaataa he
 It is terrible that in some cases of rape, some sections of society have blamed the victim
 4 saal pehle maine MARD (men Against Rape & Discrimination) kii sthapana kii thi
 Through this, i wanted to fight against gender violence
 kuch ghatnaon main mahilaon ko galat tehraaya jaataa he, lekin kuch or sabhi main antar he
 However, there are some cases where men are chased, exploited and falsely accused
 yah sachai hamaare desh ke sarvottam nyaayalay ne bhi maani he
 Hrithik said - If i had kept quiet, people would have believed Kangana's words, seeing this, i must speak today
 media main jis tarah is vivaad ko dikhaaya gaya he, wo chintajanak he
 Some of our big journalists unilaterally presented the story to the woman without knowing the truth
 kya yah duusari party ke saath bhedbhaav nahin he?kuch samay ke liye sari bhaawanaaon, pakshpaat ko alag rakhkar un tathyon ko dekhte hai, jo maujuud hai
 The woman says that she had a 7-year affair and during that time both shared many e-mails
 kangana se afaire-vivaad: 2 saal baad rithik ne 766 shabdon main di safihalanki us shaks ne manaa kiya he ki usne koi i-mail nahin kiya
 He has also filed a complaint
 saare documents, apane phone, laptop sab sabamit kar diya he
 But the woman has not done this
 kisi naa kisi kaaran se wo aisa karne se manaa kar rahi he
 Giving your phone and laptop will not only be valid legally, but will also prove that she is telling the truth
 uske oficial i-mail acount main mahila ke oficial i-mail acount se bheje gaye hajaar se zyada i-mels hai
 He also has content sex
 wo kahati he ki usne yah i-mail nahin bheja, balki us shaks ne uskaa acount hack kar ke khud ko mail kiya
 If he was in a relationship for 7 years, what did he need to do
 to kya usne mahila ke kisi bhi mail kaa riplai kiya?jahaan tak ham jaanate hai
 
 
 No, i did not reply to any
 yahaan rukiye or khud se puuchhie
 If a woman got such mails and she would call it harassment
 tab aapkaa kya riection hota? kya aap us shaks par vishwaas karte agar wo kahata ki wo relationships main the or mahila ne uskaa acount hack kar khud ko mels bheje hai
 there's more
 
 
 mahila ne ek tasviir share kii, jisamen donon the
 He said that this is the time when they both had an affair
 asli tasviir main unke dost bhi the, jisamen unki patni (ab eks-wif) thim
 Why others were deliberately cropped
 mahila ke paas koi massej or tasviir nahin he, jo yah sabit kar sake ki donon 7 saal ke relationships main the
 There is also no picture of their so-called engagement in Paris
 kangana ne riject kii thi salmaan kii 'bajrangi bhaijan', mili thim gaaliyanus shaks ne yah bhi kaha he ki uske passport par us samay kaa (sagaai) france kaa stamp bhi nahin he
 Doesn't all this raise questions in your mind? So what is the truth? Actually the truth is that we do not know the truth
 maine aaj yah sab isliye kaha he kyonki kuch log abhi se hi nattejey par pahunch gaye hai or kuch log mahila ko bolte rahane kii aazaadee de rahe hai
 All this is being done without thinking how the woman's words will affect the man's family and children
 yah tiarapy ke liye ho saktaa he, lekin yah bahut bhayanak he
 Until the verdict is arrived, it is not right to judge someone on the basis of one's statement

 But like an old friend, i would like to say that you should hold the dignity of the post of Prime Minister
 Why do we come with odd & ridiculous definitions
 
 
 like PPP for INC (pondicherry, Punjab & Pariwar)

 Anything can happen
 Being PM does not make anyone the wisest in the country

 only majority

 pradhanmantri banane se koi budhimaan nahin ban jaataa he
 Let the people in Karnataka decide
 shatrughna sinha ne in sabhi twit main pradhanmantri narendra modi ke saath-saath bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ko bhi tag kiya he
 Let me tell you that Shatrughan Sinha has been making rhetoric against the party and the government for a long time
 abhi haal hi main anya senior netaa yashavanth sinha ne bijepi chhod di thi, jiske baad bihar ke upmukhyamantri susheel modi ne shatrughna sinha ko bhi party chhodane kii salaah di thi
 However, Shatrughna also hit back at him
 susheel modi par hamalaa karte hue shatrughna sinha ne unhen ek chota netaa bataaya
 No one recognizes him in Bihar
 shatrughna sinha ne kaha ki susheel modi pradesh main lokapriy nahin hai
 The party lost the 2015 assembly elections because of them
 shatrughna sinhapichley kuch samay main kai vipakshi partiyon ke netaaon se lagaataar mulaakaat karte rahe hai
 Which include leaders like MK Stalin, Lalu Prasad Yadav, Swati Maliwal, Mamta Banerjee

 In Uttar Pradesh, BJP got a strong mandate in the 2017 elections
 bijepi gathbandhan ne 403 siton main se 325 siten jitkar soobe main 14 saal ke satta ke vanvaas ko khatm kiya
 The Chief Minister was crowned with the head of Yogi Adityanath, then Deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya and Dinesh Sharma
 yogi sarkaar ke ek saal kaa siyaasi safar 19 march ko puraa ho gaya he
 The defeat of gorakhpur-phulpur by-election faded bjp's celebrations
 yahi vajah he ki ab yogi mantrimandal main pherbadal hone ja rahaa he
 In such a situation, the question arises whether there will be any change in the top three in the state government or it will be limited to the ministers
 bataa den ki dilli kii satta kaa rasta upi se tay hota he
 The BJP is well aware of this
 2014 main modi ke satta main aane main bhi upi kii ahm bhoomika rahi he
 The BJP wants to prepare the ground right now to repeat the results of the 2014 Lok Sabha elections in 2019
 isi ke maddenjar sangh pramukh mohan bhagwat ne 10 din upi main guzaara tha
 During this time he understood the political pulse of the province
 iske baad bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne sangh pramukh mohan bhagwat ke saath mulaakaat karke soobe kaa feedback liya tha
 With this in view, we will visit the state next month
 10 april ko bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ke upi daure ke baad yogi kaa pehla cabinet vistaar hoga
 Many ministers may be discharged in this extension
 sutron kii maane to bijepi ke rashtriya pravaktaa sudhanshu trivedi ko bhi yogi sarkaar main shaamil kiya ja saktaa he
 In this reshuffle, some senior ministers can be removed and given the responsibility of the organization
 aise main soobe kii tikdi ko lekar sanshay bana hua he
 Yogi Adityanath Yogi Adityanath could not save his fort Gorakhpur even when he was the chief minister
 jabaki bijepi gorakhpur main pichley teen dashak ne nahin haari thi
 Despite this, the BJP candidate had to face defeat in the by-election
 gorakhpur main haar ke baad yogi adityanath kii kaaryastylee par party ke andar or baahar donon jagah se aawaaj uthi he
 Not only this, he was also accused of casteism
 yogi ke paas maujuuda samay main kareeb grih mantralay sahit 36 mantralay hai
 Not only this, Om Prakash has also raised the demand to make Keshav Maurya instead of Rajbhar Yogi as CM
 haalanki upachunaav ke haar ke baad party adhyaksh amit shah ne yogi ke kaamkaaj kii tarif kii he
 In such a situation, there is no threat to his chair
 lekin kuch vibhaag jarur liye ja sakate hai
 Keshav Prasad Maurya Keshav Prasad Maurya, who holds the second position in Uttar Pradesh's power, could not save his stronghold Phulpur
 jabaki wo soobe main yogi ke samanaantar sarkaar chalaate rahe hai
 Keshav has 4 departments in the state, including PWD
 phulpur main haar ke baad unke hi kshetra main unhen dipti siem ke pad se hataae jane kii aawaaj uthi he
 Keshav is considered an OBC face in the Yogi government
 yogi-keshav kii aapasi kadavaahat jagajaahir hai
 In such a situation, will the cabinet reshuffle fall on Keshav? In the Yogi government of Dinesh Sharmasube, Dinesh Sharma is the deputy CM as well as handling five departments including secondary and higher education
 dinesh sharma sangh or party alaakaman ke kareebi maane jate hai
 Stay away from the party limelight
 party main brahman chehre ke taur par unhen cabinet main jagah di gai thi
 He has not been in controversies at the moment
 aise main mantrimandal ke vistaar main unke khilaaf koi kadam uthe ye mushkil he

 The decree the Panchayat has given is astonishing
 panchayat ne kaha he ki yadi samaaj main shaamil hona he to apni paanch saal kii beti kii shaadi aath saal ke bachche se karaani hogi
 On receiving the complaint of this decree, the administration has warned to register a case against the concerned people of the village
 vahiin, panchayat ke faisle ke baad ladki kii maa shaadi rukvane ke liye jila prashasan se guhaar laga rahi he
 The incident is from Banjara community-dominated Tarapur village, about 70 km from Guna district headquarters and the case was revealed when the mother of her five-year-old daughter complained to the Tughlaqi decree from Guna district administration last Friday
 Asked to protect her from this gross injustice with her innocent daughter
 guna ke apper jila magistrate niaj khan ne bataaya, "jile ke aaron tehsil antargat tarapur gaanv kii rahane vaali is bacchee kii maa jila prashasan ke paas ai or apni paanch saal kii beti kii shaadi rukvane kii guhaar karne lagi
 The people of the village had issued a decree about four months ago to marry the five-year-old daughter of this woman to an eight-year-old child after a panchayat
 " unhone kaha ki is maamle main jila prashasan ne tarapur gaanv ke sabhi rahavaasiyon ko chetavanee di he ki yadi unhone is ladki ke parivaar ke sadasyon par jabaran shaadi karne ke liye dabaav daalaa, to unke khilaaf exiaar darj hoga
 Khan said that although the decree was issued by the villagers about four months ago, it was not reported to the administration at that time
 unhone kaha, "ghatana kii report milane ke baad kal jila prashasan ke adhikariyon kaa ek dal is gaanv main gaya
 We have asked the female Anganwadi worker of the village to keep a close watch on this activity and inform the district administration immediately about every activity
 " The woman further said in the complaint that three years ago my husband stoned a cow's calf grazing a wheat crop on the farm, causing her death
 bachade kii maut ke baad se panchayat ne mere parivaar kaa saamaajik bahishkaar kar diya
 According to the complaint, the society had given a Panchayat at that time and asked my family to rejoin the Ganga bath and the entire village was ordered by Bhandare
 parivaar ne kisi tarah panchayat ke faisle ko puraa kiya, lekin iske baad bhi samaaj ke logon ne gaanv main sabhi tarah kaa len-dein, gaanv ke handpump se pani band kara diya tha
 Later the villagers again panchayat and said that there are many young men who want to get married in the village, but they are unable to get married due to this family member killing the calf
 yah bachade ko maarane kaa shraap he
 Khan told, "the villagers met the victim and told the victim that no young man and woman of the village were getting married due to the killing of the calf
 isliye hamen sthaneey parampara ke anusaar is shraap se chhootane ke liye sabase pehle tumhaari beti kii shaadi kerani hogi
 "he said that the Panchayat thus fixed the marriage of the five-year-old daughter of this family to an eight-year-old child from a village in Vidisha district of Madhya Pradesh
 iske baad se gaanv vaale is bacchee kii shaadi karwaane ke liye is parivaar par dabaav bana rahe hai
 The comments haalanki, is maasoom beti kii maa is shaadi ke liye raji nahin he or jila prashasan se ise rukvane kii guhaar kar rahi he
 The district administration has also executed a bond of Rs 20,000 under Section 107 (16) of the Code of Criminal Procedure on four people, including the fathers of these innocent groom and bride
 is band kaa ulanghan karne par police karrwai kii ja sakati he
 Khan said, "after getting information about this matter, we are keeping a close watch on the condition of the village

 Additional District Magistrate of Guna Niaz Khan said, "the mother of this girl, who lives in Tarapur village under Aaron Tehsil of the district, came to the district administration and requested to stop the marriage of her five-year-old daughter
 gaanv ke logon ne lagbhag chaar maheene pehle panchayat kar is mahila kii paanch saal kii beti kii shaadi aath saal ke bachche se karne kaa farmaan jari kiya tha
 "he said that in this case the district administration has warned all residents of Tarapur village that if they pressurized the girl's family members to forcibly marry, then an FIR will be lodged against them
 khan ne bataaya ki haalanki graminon ne yah farmaan kareeb chaar maheene pehle jari kar diya tha, lekin us vakt prashasan ko isaki report nahin kii gai thi
 He said, "A team of district administration officials went to this village yesterday after receiving reports of the incident
 hamane gaanv kii mahila anganwari kaaryakarta se kaha he ki vah is gatividhi par kadi najar rakhe or har gatividhi ke bare main jila prashasan ko turant suchit kare
 " mahila ne shikaayat main aage kaha he ki teen saal pehle mere pati ne khet par gehun kii fasal char rahe gaay ke bachade ko pathar maar diya tha, jisase uski maut ho gai thi
 After the calf's death, the panchayat socially boycotted my family
 shikaayat ke anusaar samaaj ne us vakt panchayat kar mere parivaar ko dobaaraa samaaj main shaamil hone ke liye ganga snaan or puure gaanv ko bhandare kaa farmaan sunaaya tha
 The family somehow fulfilled the decision of the panchayat, but even after this the people of the society had stopped all the transactions in the village, water from the village hand pump
 baad main graminon ne phir panchayat kii or kaha ki gaanv main shaadi karne laayak kai yuvak hai, lekin is parivaar ke sadsy dwaara bachade ko jaan se maarane ke kaaran inaki shaadi nahin ho paa rahi he

 The party was given by promoter Anand Mahindra in honor of the winners of the Pro Kabaddi League (PKL)
 niketan ne trophy lekar logon ko gale lagaaya, badi companiyon ke maalikon se haath milaae, jaani-maani hastiyon ke liye hawa main chumban uchhaale or dance floor par utar gaye

 sijan shuru hote samay chaaru team maalikon se kehete rahete the ki un logon ko na bechein, jo do din tak apane daftaron main intjaar karaate hai
 Today he says that such people can come but no one is willing to sell
 ab yah yakeen ho gaya he ki munafa to hoga
 The concept that Kabaddi is a game of villages has been thwarted
 bharat main sabase zyada 415 peshewar kabddi club greater mumbai main hai
 Today they are in great demand, now they have become a primetime TRP club instead of a time consuming club, where people are selling their goods
 mahindra khel se isliye jude hai ki sab kii najaron main rahen
 Similarly, team owners like Jaipur Pink Panthers owners Abhishek and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan also want to be in front of everyone's eyes
 patna pirets ke maalik mukund steel ke rajesh shah jaise filmi duniya se baahar ke team maalikon ne bhi koi kasar nahin chodi
 Shah invited his friend film actor Vivek Oberoi to the matches and not only made the team's theme song "dhool Chata De"
 ise prasoon joshi ne likhaa, aadesh shrivastav ne sangeet diya or kailash kher ne gaaya
 Kabaddi is a sport which is prevalent among people of every income, breaking the border of city, town and village as it requires no equipment other than just 13X10 square meters of land
 bharat ke skulon main, kasbon main kabddi nange paanv ke maidaanon main kheli jaati he
 There is no difference between boy and girl in this
 sabhi khelte hai
 Charu believes that by bringing it into business and hustle and bustle, the opportunity has been exploited, which was always there, but people were unable to recognize it
 iskaa asar neeche tak ja rahaa he or gali muhallon main kabddi-kabddi kaa shor he
 In kabaddi grounds, all the talk is done by hand
 kahin jaangh par duhatthad padataa to kahin sir jhukaakar palatnaa padataa he
 The victory in this is that of a vocal player, who does not care about status, dialect or gender
 saamaajik vishleshak santosh desai kii maane to isaki lokapriyata kii sabase badi vajah isaki bhartiyata or pracheen parampara he
 In the last few years, the famous players of Kabaddi have come from the second and third tier towns, and till yesterday, westernized India is also adopting the identity of being an Indian
 future group ke siio kishor biyani kaa kahana tha, ‘‘ham to nai peedi main isaki lokapriyata dekh kar hairaan hai
 We did not expect so much
 ’’ khilaadi maanate hai ki kabddi ne bhartiya hone, andhvishwasi hone, bhaawanaaon main bandhe hone, lambey-chaude kad-lathi or aakraamak swabhaav hone par bhi unhen khub pyaar dilaayaa he
 Despite coming from modest families, a feeling of pride in the new environment has added the players
 puneri palaton ke lambey-chaude captain 27 varshiya vajeer singh haryana ke ponkhedi khiri main kisaan parivaar se aae hai, police main naukari karte hai or bharat ke liye khelte hai
 They show pride in life and minor family identity
 lagbhag sabhi khilaadi sarkari naukari karte hai
 Navneet Gautam has worked in BSNL and ONGC
 anup kumaar siarpief ke baad air india or ab haryana police main kaam karte hai
 According to Ajay Thakur, Kabaddi was adopted in most families in the greed that a permanent government job and salary would be obtained
 ye aise khilaadi nahin hai, jinke paas vigyapanon kii deal kii shaano-shaukat thi
 Today, against the earnings of crores of rupees of IPL players, the kabaddi players did not even imagine the bonus that they get in the auction fees for playing the tournament
 mitti kaa khel kabddi in mitti ke sapooton ko achaanak hero banane laga he
 Every kabaddi player touches before touching the ground and fists it with eyes and chest and swears
 railway main mukhya tikat inspector rajesh kumaar bataate hai, ‘‘yah mitti yani mathrubhumi hi hamaari sab kuch he
 "even today, kabaddi is being played on rubber mats all over the world in place of clay and also in PKL, but Rajesh does not think that the players' ties with the soil will ever be broken

 These are children who are using bad things to the fullest
 salmaan khanko pataakhe bilkul pasand nahin he or isi vajah se unhone hi khud dharavi ke bacchon ke saath diwaali manaane kaa idia diya
 Salman Khan and the children are eager to meet each other

 raaj thakare kii party emenes (maharashtra navnirmaan sena) kaa paak kalakaaron ko lekar jari virodh kaa doglaapan khulkar saamne aayaa he
 Ever since actor Salman Khan has supported Pakistani artists on this issue, MNS has sniffed as if
 ab party apane aakraamak andaaj main jawaab hi nahin de rahi he
 Earlier, MNS had said that Pakistani artists should return to Bollywood from Bollywood, targeting the army camp in Uri
 apane mudde ko aage badhaate hue emenes ne film 'rais' or 'i dil he mushkil' ke pradarshan rokane kaa elaan bhi kiya tha
 At the same time, producer-director Karan Johar also had a fierce performance outside the office
 is dauraan 'i dil he mushkil' ke actor or pakistani kalakaar fawaad khan ke swadesh laut jane se maamle ko or tool mila
 a new twist in the entire development came when actor Salman Khan made his stand clear on the matter
 salmaan ne mumbai main media ke sawaalon ke jawaab dete hue kaha ki pakistani kalakaar aatanki nahin hai
 They come to this country on visas and work permits
 salmaan ke is ravaiye ke baad emenes kii sine ikai ke adhyaksh amey khopakar se jab unki pratikriya media karmiyon ne janani chaahi to ve tapaak se bol gaye ki kyon aakhir har baar emenes hi is mudde par baat kare? koi or kyon nahin bolta?tippaniyan It is said that the friendship of party supremo Raj Thackeray and actor Salman Khan is the reason behind the change in this role of MNS
 raaj thakare salmaan ke ghar ganesh pujan main hajiri lagaate hai to salmaan emenes dwaara yojit kaaryakramon main hissaa le chuke hai
 In such a situation, the second-tier leaders of the party do not want to disturb the friendship of the high command by making aggressive statements
 isliye emenes ne salmaan ke khilaaf andolan kaa koi elaan nahin kiya he
 By the way, looking at the opportunity of this silence, Shiv Sena has advised Salman
 shivasena mantri subhash desai ne kaha he ki salmaan apane pita se rashtrabhakti maamle main salaah len
 Salim Khan is better informed in this matter
 isse pehle, uri main sena ke camp ko aatankiyon dwaara nishaanaa banane kaa zikr karte hue emenes ne kaha tha ki bollywood se pakistani kalakaar waapas laut jaaen
 Taking the issue further, MNS also announced to stop the performances of films Raees and Ae Dil Hai Mushkil
 saath hi nirmaataa-nirdeshak karan johar ke daftar ke baahar ugr pradarshan bhi kiya tha
 During this, the case was further aggravated by the return of 'ae Dil Hai Mushkil' actor and Pakistani artist Fawad Khan
 puure ghatnakram main nayaa mode tab aayaa jab is maamle par abhinayta salmaan khan ne apana rukh saaf kiya
 Salman responded to media queries in Mumbai and said that Pakistani artists are not terrorists
 ve to vija or work permit par is desh main aate hai
 After this attitude of Salman, when the media personnel wanted to know his response to Ameya Khopkar, the president of MNS cine unit, he spoke with aplomb that why MNS should talk on this issue every time? Why no one else speaks? Comments bataaya jaataa he ki emenes kii is bhoomika main badlaav ke peeche party supremeo raaj thakare or actor salmaan khan kii dosti vajah he

 Meanwhile, his family grew
 unka paariwarik jivan to jarur khush tha, parantu sampurna taur par wo apni jindagi se khush nahin thi or samaaj ke liye kuch karnaa chaahati thi
 Due to being a Naxalite affected area, people could not raise their voice against any injustice
 jaya ne tab sochaa ki agar aawaaj nahin uthaai gai to ladakiyon or mahilaon kaa isi tarah shoshan hota rahegaa
 After which Jaya Devi first got 15 days training on how to do self help group work and started teaching people how to save

 For this, they sought old children's books from the people through newspapers and other methods of propaganda and worked to distribute those books among the children of the village
 is dauraan unhone gaanvon main shiksha ke prati jaagrukta laayaa
 Every year, Jaya also did many things for the farmers who were troubled by crop failure due to drought
 unhone agriculture technology management agency ke gavarning sadasyon ko barish ke pani ko bachaane kii salaah di tathaa banjar jameen par ped lagane ke liye kaha
 After this, Jaya also received training in 'rainwater harvesting'

 uttarakhand ke chunavi itihaas main gangotri seat se jis bhi party kaa ummidavaar jeeta, pradesh main usee dal kii sarkaar bani
 In such a situation, a saying has become prevalent here that the person who won the Gangotri seat will retain power
 siyasat ke is sanyog ko dharm guru patit paavani maa ganga kii aseem krupa qaraar dete hai
 Whether it is a coincidence or a miracle regarding this seat of Uttarkashi district, the reality is that whichever party candidate from Uttarkashi has won its own government in the state
 ab yah sanyog gangotri vidhansabha seat se jud gaya he, jo ki uttarakhand banane ke baad uttarkashi jile kii vidhansabha seat main parivartit ho gaya
 After the formation of Uttarakhand state in the year 2000, Uttarkashi assembly was divided into four assembly seats in Jaunsar, Tehri, Purola, Yamunotri and Gangotri due to delimitation of assembly seats
 varsh 2002 main rajya main hue pehle chunaav main congress ke vijaypal sajwan congress se jeet kar vidhansabha main pahunche, varsh 2012 main dobaaraa phir congress ke vijaypal ke jeetne par pradesh main unheen kii party congress kii sarkaar bani
 Now it will be interesting to see in the upcoming assembly elections 2017, how long u will remain intact
 uttarkashi ke saath 60 saalon se judaa he mythkauttarkashi kii is seat ke saath yah myth judaa rahaa
 In 1958, Ramchandra Uniyal of Congress became the MLA from Uttarkashi seat of Tehri district, which was part of UP, then the Congress government was formed in the state
 iske baad teen baar congress ke krishna singh vidhayak bane, to pradesh main teenon baar congress kii sarkaar bani
 Congress leader Baldev Singh Arya became MLA here when Uttarkashi assembly seat was declared for Scheduled Caste in 1974, even then Congress government was formed in the state
 vahiin apatkaal ke baad raajnneetik uthal-puthal ke samay janata party asttiv main ai
 At that time, Janta Party's Himachal Lal Juwatha won the elections and the Janata Party government was formed in the state
 aise main uttarkashi seat se jude is myth ko banaae rakhane ke liye bijepi or congress donon dalon ne hi gangotri vidhansabha par hameshaa apni puri takat jhonki he
 This time it will also be a miracle? Given this combination of Gangotri assembly seat, Congress is going to play its seat in the assembly elections this time too, on the other hand, BJP has also fielded its strongest candidate Gopal Rawat
 
 gopal ravat isse pehle bhi chunaav jeet kar bhaajapa ko satta sukh dilaa chuke hai
 Therefore, both the party as well as the common people are excited about the result of the electoral duel in Gangotri seat
 ab dekhne he ki saal 1958 se lekar ab tak jis seat ne party kaa bhagya tay kiya, kya vah is baar bhi itihaas doharaa paaegaa

 mumbai police ne hatya kii ek aisi gutthi sulajhaai he, jisamen beemaa kii rakam paane ke liye hatya kaa drama rachaa gaya tha, lekin jab police tah tak gai to wo khudakshi kaa maamla niklaa
 According to DCP Shahji Umap, the body of Satish, who came to Mumbai from Coimbatore on January 11, was found hanging from a fan in the room of Kamala Guest House in Chembur 4 days later
 uski ek haath kii kalai kati thi or farsh par khun failaa hua tha
 The door of the room was locked from outside and the young man's phone was missing, so the police registered a case of murder and started investigating
 par ab jab raaj par se pardaa khulaa to puraa maamla hatya kaa naa hokar khudakushi kaa niklaa
 On January 14, the first suspicion of the Chembur police involved in the investigation of the crime by registering a case of murder, went to the person behind the young man in CCTV, because in another CCTV the man was seen going out of the guest house after some time
 tippaniyan According to the police, at first they did not find the person seen in CCTV, but it was found that the deceased was a jeweler by profession and was from Kerala
 
 The family came to know that on January 10, he was going to Mumbai with his friend Martin from Mumbai with gold
 police ne martin ko pakadaa to usase ek or shaks sharavanan kii jaankaree mili
 He was in jail in Tamil Nadu
 sharavanan se poochtacha ke baad police mohamad riyaaz tak pahunchi
 Riaz was the only person who was seen in CCTV behind the deceased on January 11 in the hotel
 uske baad puraa maajaraa saamne aa gaya
 DCP Shahji Umap explains that Mohammad Riaz told the police that Satish had a liability of about 16 kg of gold
 iske alaava usne 2 flat par lone bhi le rakhaa tha
 Troubled by the debtors' tirade, he, along with Mohammad Riaz and Sharvanan, had unsuccessfully tried to rob and steal a businessman, but when all the plans failed, he decided to commit suicide, but the family owed it to him even if he committed suicide
 The money does not go away and the insurance is not available, so with the help of Riyaz, Kudkushi conspired to get the insurance money by showing him a murder incident
 iske liye usne riyaaz ko 4 lakh 50 hajaar ke kareeb rupee bhi diye, lekin uskaa drama pakadaa gaya
 Life was lost and insurance money was not received
 disipi shahji umap ke mutabik, beete 11 janvari ko coimbatore se mumbai aae satish kaa shav 4 din baad chembur ke kamala guest house ke kamare me pankhe se lataka hua mila tha
 He had a wrist cut off his arm and blood was spread on the floor
 kamare ke daravaaje par baahar se taala laga tha or yuvak kaa phone gaayab tha, isliye police ne hatya kaa maamla darj kar tahakikat shuru kii
 But now when the curtain opened on Raj, the whole matter turned out to be suicide rather than murder
 14 janvari ko hatya kaa maamla darj kar vaardaat kii jaanch main juty chembur police kaa sabase pehla shaq sisitivi main yuvak ke peeche dikh rahe shaks par gaya, kyonki ek duusare sisitivi main wo shaks kuch der baad guest house se baahar jaataa dikh rahaa tha
 The comments police ke mutabik, pehle unhen sisitivi main dikh rahaa shaks to nahin mila, lekin mritak ke bare main pataa chalaa ki wo peshey se jeweler tha auki kerala kaa rahane vaala tha
 
 gharavaalon se pataa chalaa ki 10 janvari ko wo apane dost martin ke saath coimbatore se sona lekar mumbai jane vaala tha
 When the police caught Martin, he got information about another person, Sharvanan
 wo tamilnadu kii jail main band tha
 Police reached Mohammad Riyaz after questioning Sharavanan
 riyaaz hi wo shaks tha jo hotel main 11 janvari ko mritak ke peeche sisitivi main dikh rahaa tha
 After that the whole scene was revealed
 disipi shahji umap bataate hai ki mohammad riyaaz ne police ko bataaya ki satish ke upar takreeban 16 kilo ke sone kii dendaree thi
 Apart from this, he also took a loan on 2 flats
 dendaaron ke takaadon se pareshaan hokar usne mohammad riyaaz or sharavanan ke saath milakar ek vyapaaree ko luutane or chori kii asafal koshish bhi kii thi, lekin jab saare plan fail ho gaye to usne khudakushi karne kaa faisla kiya, lekin khudakushi karne par bhi parivaar kii dendaree dur nahin hoti or bime kii rakam bhi nahin milti, isliye riyaaz kii madad se khudakushi ko hatya kii vaardaat dikhaa beemaa kii rakam paane kii saazish rachi
 For this, he also gave Riyaz around 4 lakh 50 thousand rupees, but his drama was caught

 iske liye usne riyaaz ko 4 lakh 50 hajaar ke kareeb rupee bhi diye, lekin uskaa drama pakadaa gaya
 Life was lost and insurance money was not received

 When the police caught Martin, he got information about another person, Sharvanan
 wo tamilnadu kii jail main band tha
 Police reached Mohammad Riyaz after questioning Sharavanan

 aapako bataa den ki isse pehle gulel ne gujarat ke varisht police adhikari girish el singhl or amit shah kii baatcheet kii tepe ke ansh jari kiye the
 According to the tape, at the instance of Shah, Saheb, Singhal was spying on Madhuri, a female architect
 haalanki ye tepe sahib kii pahchaan nahin bataa paae
 Gulel released a dozen pictures on Thursday
 yah tasviren oktober 2005 ke kuccha sharad utsav kii hai
 In these pictures, Modi is seen with a woman, whose face has been hidden
 inamen se ek tasviir main vivaadit iees adhikari pradeep sharma bhi maujuud hai or mahila un donon ke saath khadi he
 According to the tape released by the website, the narrative is as follows

 in tasveeron se pataa chalata he ki modi maadhuri ko avaidh rup se jasusi karne se kam se kam paanch saal pehle se jaanate the

 'english winglish' se shridevi 15 saal baad filmon main vaapasi kar rahi hai or gauri scindia bataur director debyue kar rahi hai
 'english Vinglish' is the story of a housewife Shashi Godbole (sridevi) who is living a happy life with her husband and children
 ghar kii dekharekh ke saath shashi laddu banane kaa said bijnes bhi karti hai, lekin shashi kii zindagi main bas ek hi kami he
 
 
 She does not know English, due to which many times her husband and children make fun of her
 iske chalate vah apamaanit mahasoos karti he
 This is the foundation of the story of this film


 i will not tell the story ahead, but it will definitely say that Sridevi has made a comeback
 film main shridevi kii behtareen paraformens he
 The story is simple, but the film has many beautiful moments
 yah gauri scindia kaa direction hi he, jisane ek saadhaaran si kahani ko ek acchhee film main tabdeel kar diya
 The comments sabhi qirdaar apni jagah par bakhubi janche hai, par french actor mehadi nebbou ke behtareen abhinay ne shridevi ke qirdaar ko or nikharaa he
 Amitabh Bachchan's guest appearance brings a smile to his face
 badi aasaani se nirdeshak ne yah sandesh bhi de diya ki bhashaa zaruri he, lekin itani nahin ki vah bhaawanaaon ko mohataaj banaae
 You will find this message in many scenes filmed with Mehdi and Sridevi
 ab baat kuch khaamiyon kii
 
 
 Compared to today's 'fast Pace' and 'glossy' films, the speed of this film is a bit slower
 doosraa, film main shridevi kii beti kaa qirdaar thodaa atapata laga, kyonki hindustan main is umr ke bachche apni maa se itnaa abhadra vyavhaar nahin kar sakate, jaisaa film main dikhaaya gaya he
 The climax scene needed to be a bit more compelling, but overall a good family film
 
 
 iske liye meri reating he 3 star
 
 
 Along with taking care of the house, Shashi also does the business of making laddus, but there is only one shortcoming in Shashi's life
 
 
 unhen angreji nahin aati, jisaki vajah se kai baar unke pati or bachche unka mazaaq udaate hai
 As a result, she feels humiliated
 yahi he is film kii kahani kii neenv


aage kii kahani main nahin bataaungaa, lekin yah zarur kahuunga ki shridevi ne dhamaakedaar vaapasi kii he
 Sridevi has an excellent performance in the film
 kahani saadhaaran he, par film main kai khubasurat moments hai
 This is the direction of Gauri Shinde, which transformed a simple story into a good film
 tippaniyan All the tenants are well placed in their place, but the excellent performance of French actor Mehdi Nebbou has further enhanced the tenure of Sridevi
 amitabh bachchan kii guest apiyarence chehre par muskaan le aati he
 Very easily, the director also gave the message that language is necessary, but not so much that it appeals to the emotions
 yah sandesh aapako mehadi or shridevi ke saath filmaae gaye kai seens main milegaa
 Now talk of some shortcomings
 
 
 aaj kii 'fast pes' or 'glouci' filmon ke mukaable is film kii raftaar thodi dhimi he
 Secondly, the role of Sridevi's daughter in the film seemed a bit awkward, as children of this age in India cannot behave with their mother so rudely as shown in the film
 climex seen ko thodaa or damdaar banane kii zarurat thi, par kul milakar ek acchhee paariwarik film
 
 
 My rating for this is 3 stars
