 To stop molestation and mistreatment against women and girls, the Yogi government has created an anti-romeo squad
 makasad he ki manchalon par nakel or mahilaon ko surakshit hone kaa ahsaas karana
 You should also explain the blueprint of the anti-romeo squad
 kuch aisa he anti romeo dasta* is dal main kam se kam 8 se 10 police vaale rahenge
 * One Sub Inspector, two constables or one head constable
 * is daste main ek se do mahila sipaahiyon kii bhi vyavastha he
 Role of Anti Romeo Squad * Investigation of Uniformed Youth near Schools and Colleges
 * bevajaah khadaa hone par pahchaan patr dikhaanaa jaruri
 * Interrogation of suspicious looking people
 * karrwai kii video recording kaa aadesh
 * Counseling will be done with the family of the people
 haalanki yogi kaa mishan mahilaon kii suraksha he, lekin isaki aad main kai sanghathanon ne apni dadaageeri or dabangai se ise badnaam bhi kiya
 Later Yogi also issued guidelines in a strict tone
 shuruyaat vivaadon ke saath beshak hui he, lekin jis makasad se anti romeo daste kaa gathan hua he

 After backing the bill in the Lok Sabha, the Shiv Sena said on Tuesday that it would not support the bill until things became clear
 aaj jab rajyasabha main bill pesh hone se pehle hi shivasena kii taraf se bayaan aayaa ki unhone voting ko lekar ab tak koi faisla hi nahin liya he
 Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut told Aaj Tak that no decision has been taken on what the Shiv Sena has to do in the Rajya Sabha on the Citizenship Amendment Bill
 unhone kaha ki ham charchaa ke dauraan dekhenge ki kis tareeke ke mudde saamne aa rahe hai or usee ke aadhaar par nirnay liya jayega ki kya karnaa he
 Explain that in the Lok Sabha voting on December 9 on the Citizenship Amendment bill, Shiv Sena went against its ally Congress and supported the Modi government
 ek taraf congress jahaan bill kaa purajor virodh kar rahi thi, vahiin shivasena ne voting main congress ko chhodkar bijepi kaa saath diya

 This time, however, he has reached the semi-finals
 bharat kii maujuuda aarthik dhalaan agar lambii chali to?taaja aakalnon kii maane to khatra bharpoor he
 If that happens now, his greatest achievement is at stake for India
 haal ke dashakon main tej vikaas kii madad se bharat ne garibi kam karne main nirnaayak safalataa hasil kii he, mandi kaa grahan isi uplabdhi par laga he
 If the next assessment of World Bank and IMF focuses on increasing poverty in India, do not be surprised
 vishwa bank maanata he ki pichley ek dashak main duniya main garibi kii dar ko aadha karne (2005 se 2015) kii safalataa main bharat kii bhoomika sabase badi he
 The United Nations Development Program (UNDP) measures multidimensional poverty in the world
 isaki taaja report (2018) bataati he ki bharat duniya kaa pehla desh he jisane 2005-06 se 2015-16 ke bich kareeb 27 karod logon ko garibi kii rekha se baahar nikaala or aabaadi ke pratishat ke taur par garibi kareeb aadhi yani 55 fisad se 28 fisad rah gai
 This reduction in poverty occurred both in the village and the city
 garibi main yah kami bharat kii satat tej aarthik vikaas dar (ausat saat fisad) ke chalate ai lekin ab to ek saal se kam samay main bharat (july ’18 se july ’19) duniya kii sabase tej daudti arthvyavastha se sabase teji se dhimi padati arthvyavastha main badal gaya he
 This decline is long and sharp and deep
 rigerv bank, ikra yaa india retings se lekar vishwa bank, iemef, mudies, fich ne bharat kii vikaas dar ke akalan main bahut kam samay main bahut badi (0

 yani ki kamai, bachat, khapat kii yah ziddee mandi lambii chalegi or aath-nau fisad yaa dahaai kii vikaas dar to ab ummiido kii bahes se bhi baahar he
 For how the collapsing growth will weaken the fight against poverty, we need to open up the complex layers of India's recession from where income growth in the last decade came
 • jidipi (jivie yani mulya vardhan par aadhaarit) main kheti kaa hissaa (2014 se 2017 ke bich) 18

 • The debt crisis has deepened in small industries, where earnings and employment come from

 The declining rate of rural wages, more people coming to employment in farming and the abundance of young laborers for MNREGA in the villages are early signs of increasing poverty in the villages
 shaharon main kareeb 8 karod log bhawan nirmaan or chote udyogon main mandi kii maar jhel rahe hai
 This unemployment rate is higher than the national average
 These are the basic reasons why there is confusion about quick improvement in income, consumption and savings in India and the world agencies are worried about the slowdown in India

 But this time it is not so
 bhartiya arthvyavastha kramash: dhimi padi he
 That is, the overall income of the people is decreasing gradually
 hairat kii baat he ki pichley paanch saal main sarkaar ne garibi kii paimaaish or pahchaan ke nae formule ko taiyaar karne kaa kaam hi roak diya
 NITI Aayog in its report in June 2017 said that it is not necessary to identify the poor or measure the income of the people, it is better to measure the impact of government schemes
 thik us vakt hamen jab garibi ke anya jatil ayaamon (mausam, beemaari, visthaapan, vikaas) ke samaadhaan talashne the or ek nunatam jivan str uplabdh karana tha, hamaare paas garibon kii pahchaan kaa aadhunik formula nahin he or duusari taraf dhahati growth ek badi aabaadi ko waapas garibi kii khai main dhakelne vaali he

 His term will be two years
 raksha mantralay ke varisht sutron ne bataaya ki kendriya mantrimandal ne sena pramukh ke pad ke liye guuruuvaar ko hi singh ke naam ko manjuuri di thi jiske baad mantralay ne aadesh jari kar diya
 Singh is the third generation officer of the Rajput Regiment
 haal hi main singh kaa naam tab khabaron main aayaa tha jab unhone general rank ke chaar adhikariyon ke khilaaf karrwai kii sifarish kii thi
 The chargesheet was filed against these officers in the Sukhna land scam in Darjeeling district of West Bengal
 raksha mantralay ne bhi chaaron ke khilaaf karrwai main samaan ravaiye kii maang kii thi
 After graduating from the Defense Services Staff College in Wellington, Singh went on to pursue a Rangers course from Fort Benning in the US and the US Army War College in Carlisle

 The family of the martyr Captain Kundu in Poonch in Jammu and Kashmir has asked the country and the government a question
 ye sawaal bhi jaij he
 The family says they are proud of Kapil's martyrdom
 kapil kundu kii badi bahan sonia kundu ne 'ajtak' se khaas baatcheet main kaha ki jab wo apane aasapaas kuch chijen dekhati hai to ek pal ke liye man main sawaal uthta he ki kya chote bhai ko army main bhejnaa parivaar kaa sahi faisla tha?sonia kundu ne kaha ki unke bhai ne jis din army jwine kiya, usee din usne parivaar se kah diya tha, uske liye pehle desh, phir batalian or uske baad parivaar he
 According to Sonia, once she asked Kapil that what you are doing, is it really country service? In response to this question, Kapil said, 'my work is country service and they will continue to do till death, leave it to the rest of the countrymen, how they take our work is their job
 aage sonia ne kaha, 'bhai ko khone kaa gam kya hota he, ye main bataati hum
 Kapil was 9 years younger than me, i fed him in the lap, brought up
 main use haragij nahin khona chaahati thi
 But when he used to talk, we were proud to see his spirit
 ab hamaare paas kuch nahin bachaa he
 But today i want to ask if the cost of his martyrdom is justified '
 sonia kundu ke sawaal se panel main baithe logon kii ankhen bhar ain
 Sonia said that even before that when a young soldier was martyred at the border, on that day also we used to cry bitterly
 ye aaj kii baat nahin he
 Even today, even if i lost my brother, we are crying for 4 hours more
 lekin ye ham saalon se dekhte aae hai
 It has happened in the past and a sister has lost her brother
 shahid captain kii bahan aage kahati hai, 'jab bhi is tarah kii ghati se khabaren aati thim, tab hamaari neend ud jaati thi
 Whether he was a family member, he too lost his life in the same way that Kapil has lost his youth today
 hamen pataa he ki ab meraa bhai kapil kabhi waapas nahin aayega
 But everyone should think about the martyrdom of soldiers on the border
 aakhir jaan to ek jawan kii jaati he
 'we saw with our own eyes that everyone's eyes were moist on the martyrdom of Kapil
 hamaari bhavnaae army acchhee tarah se samajhati hai, kyonki army se judaa har ek log kisi na kisi parivaar se hai
 Regarding martyrdom, we saw the pain of losing our partner in the eyes of every army officer and soldiers
 lekin kya seemaa par shahadat hi aakhri upaay he
 Everyone should think on this

 is pradarshnee main yahi sandesh diya gaya he ki 'koi kapadaa rape hone se nahin roak saktaa' Amid allegations of irregularities against Lalu Prasad Yadav and his family, the Rashtriya Janata Dal has clearly stated that the party leader and Bihar government deputy chief minister Tejashwi Yadav will not resign from his post
 yah kahkar lalu prasad ne darasal apni party kaa rukh saaf kar diya he ki unki party is mudde par jhukne ko taiyaar nahin he or ab gend nitish kumaar ke paale main he ki wo or unki party janata dal (united) lalu ke saath mahagathbandhan main bane rahete hai yaa phir apane liye nayaa rasta chunate hai
 Nitish Kumar is the representative of the government that chewed the horse of Modi's Ashwamedha to the ground of his state
 unka is jami-jamaai sarkaar ko giraakar phir chunaav kii ore janaa ek antim vikalp ho saktaa he
 There are two paths before this
 pehla yah ki wo chizon ko philhal yatharoop chhod den or doosraa yah ki mahagathbandhan kaa haath chhod bhaajapa se haath mila len
 Nitish can continue with the BJP in the government
 lekin bhaajapa se haath milaane kii ek badi qeemat bhi he
 Let's look at some such aspects - When Nitish won the election of Bihar, he emerged as the most powerful face to stop Modi in the country
 isi ke dam par wo 2019 main vipaksh kaa cheharaa banane kii kshamta bhi rakhte hai
 Nitish himself has indicated by his decisions that he is an opposition leader himself, not a small opposition party standing behind the Congress
 bhaajapa se haath milaanaa unke liye vipaksh kaa chehre banane kii gunjaaish ko puri tarah khatm kar degaa
 Nitish cannot get more than the Chief Minister's post by staying with the BJP, but if not, he can also become an alternative to Modi
 duusari badi baat yah he ki bhaajapa par nirbharta nitish ke liye bahut nuksaandeh sabit ho sakati he
 This will save their land for the moment, but the BJP will leave no stone unturned to stay with them
 dhyaan rahe ki bhaajapa or rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ne nitish ke shasankaal main hi rajya main apni takat or upasthiti badhaai he
 If Nitish goes with the BJP, then those who denied Modi's face and gave Nitish a third chance, will be increasingly inclined towards Modi in the next election
 isse nitish kaa janaadhar tezi se phisalegaa
 The break-up of the Grand Alliance is the end of the scope of stability and hence Modi will emerge as a better alternative to Nitish for political stability
 nitish kaa bhaajapa ke saath jane kaa matlab he apane janaadhar ko phir se kho dena
 The votebank will not stop with Nitish the way the minorities mobilized and voted in favor of Nitish in the Bihar assembly elections to stop Modi
 nitish vaise bhi lalu jaisi kisi badi sankhya vaali jaateey raajnneeti se nahin aate
 They stand with their 6-7 percent ethnic base
 isliye bhi alpsankhyak mat unke liye mahatvapurn he or modi ke saath janaa usase haath dho lenaa he
 It will also not be easy for Nitish to easily flow all the credit for defeating the BJP badly in Bihar
 na hi us netaa ke saamne jhuk janaa jiske naam par unhone sabase pehle aapatti jaahir kii thi or endie se alag ho gaye the
 Nitish's joining hands with BJP will be Modi's victory and Nitish's moral and political defeat

 sandip unnithan ne police, sena or beuroperesi kii kamiyaan ujagar karne ke saath hi in teenon ke sangharsh ko bhi kitaab main bakhubi pesh kiya he
 The National Security Guard (NSG) carried out the operation under the name 'black Tornado' at the time of 26 / 11 attack, this is also the title of the book
 sandip unnithan india today megsine main deputy editor hai or raksha se jude maamalon par kai varshon se likh rahe hai
 Apparently, his experience was very useful in writing the book
 kitaab main ghatnaon ko jis prakaar se likhaa gaya he, usase saaf jhalkata he ki jis vishay par unhone likhaa he, uske bare main unka lanbaa anubhav rahaa he
 For example, this part of the book- 'at about quarter to twelve, Joint Commissioner of Police Deven Bharti got a call from the police control room about a woman who was trapped in the Taj
 bharti taj main enesji ke saath koordination kaa kaam dekh rahe the
 The call did not come directly to Bharti, but Priya Florence Martis, who was hiding in her data center from the time the firing started in Taj, called her uncle, who informed the police control room
 unka saathi manish sarwar room ke ek anya hisse main chipa hua tha
 They had nothing to eat and drink since the terrorist attack
 'sandip unnithan ne oparation se judi har choti-badi jaankaree ko facts ke saath pesh kiya he
 The book begins by recalling the 26 / 11 attack, and then moves quickly, describing the 'black Tornado' operation
 kitaab main back story kaa bhi zikr kiya gaya he
 This part describes the role of David Coleman Headley
 iske alaava history of lashkar or taj main bandhak banaai gai priya kii kahani bhi he, jise do din baad commandos ne chhudaaya tha
 Specialty: Sandeep Unnithan has made a fine adjustment of emotional elements and precious facts in his book
 oparation 'blike toranado' 26 / 11 hamale kaa wo hissaa he, jis par abhi tak bahut zyada baat bhi nahin hui thi
 Most reports in the media have also been made from the attack angle, which was justified at the time of the incident, but somewhere the operation 'black Tornado' was not discussed as much as it should have been
 hamale se itar 26 / 11 kaa ek sach yah bhi to he, jiske bare main hamaare desh ke logon ko maaloom hona chahie ki hamaare commandos kaise lade, kin samasyaon ke saath lade, kahaan gadabad hui or kaise zyada nuksaan hone se bachaaya gaya?'blike toranado' main taj, oberoi or nariman house main chalaae resecue oparation kii puri detel ke saath hi kai sawaal bhi uthaae gaye hai
 The most important question that emerged in these was - Why was Mumbai not ready despite repeated warnings? Why did the police not have better training and arms? tivi tarika shweta tiwari maanati hai ki televijan kii mahila kalakaaron ko vividhta bhare kirdaar karne kaa mauka nahin miltaa
 Shweta said, 'I see that nowhere are any women doing different characters and characters
 ve sabhi meetha, saadhaaran or pyaara sa dikhne vaala kirdaar kar rahi hai
 If she does not do these roles, then she is doing negative characters
 'in dinon soni ke 'parvarish-kuch khatti kuch mithi' dharawahik main sweety kaa kirdaar kar raheen shweta ne isamen kiye gaye apane kirdaar ko vividhta se bharaa bataaya
 Shweta said, 'sweety is sometimes very bad, sometimes selfish but sometimes he has his own rules
 vah aapke saath kuch bura nahin karegi na hi aapako apane saath bura karne degi
 This is a true character who was not yet shown in TV channels
 is tarah ke kirdaar bollywood main hote hai lekin tivi par pasand nahin kiye jate
 i think these changes should happen
 'is dharavahik main vah ek maa kaa bhi kirdaar kar rahi hai or vah maanati hai ki aaj ke mata-pita kaa najariya bacchon ke prati lacheela hua he
 He said, 'I think people don't care much nowadays
 hamaare samay main hamen padhane or ratta lagane ko kaha jaataa tha
 We were asked to become doctors, engineers
 lekin aajkal ye chijen nahin ho raheen

 According to sources, Vidya has never been a social media actress, but many of her fake accounts are on Twitter and her tweets bother her
 yahi vajah he ki unhone ab apana hi acount kholane kaa faisla kiya he
 a source close to Vidya told that through this medium, Vidya will talk to her fans
 haalanki yah unke liye ek alag anubhav hoga kyonki unhen ab tak in sabhi plateforms ke bare main jaankaree to thi lekin aisa pehali baar hoga jab vah khud is par apni baaten share karengi

 saath hi unhone kaha ki jiesti pranali ko sthir hone main kareeb ek saal lagegaa
 More than a dozen central and state levies like excise, service tax and VAT have been included in the GST
 jiesti kii daron main badlaav kii aavashyaktaadhiya ne kaha, "jiesti kii daron main kuch badlaav kii aavashyaktaa he
 It may be that some objects are divided in the same chapter
 vastuon kii suchi banane kii jarurat he, jahaan dikhe ki yah laghu or madhyam udyogon or aam aadmi par boj zyada pad rahaa he, vahaan ham use kam karte hai to anupaalan sudharega
 "he said that it has been nearly four months since the GST was implemented

 The GST Council has also resolved several issues
 parishad in pranali main sarvocch nirnaayak nikaay he

 If Narendra Modi wants to look back at the last term, he will see that on one hand he was traveling fast and abroad, on the other hand his foreign trade policy which was steeped in Swadeshi and protectionism was also losing the advantages which his predecessors had reaped
 alabatta, samay modi ko jahaan le aayaa he, vahaan ve bharat ke duusare globaligeshan ke agua ban sakate hai
 From the perspective of the us-china trade war, the situation in India is similar to that of China in the 1980s when there was a trade war between the us-japan

 The US announced imposition of 100 per cent custom duty on imports from Japan, following which the Plaza Agreement was signed between the two in 1985

 kya nai sarkaar, nae vaishvikaran ko nae bharat kaa paracham banaaegi? Prime Minister Narendra Modi may be counting the Jan Dhan Yojana in his big successes, but resentment is growing among the people on the ground
 wo bank jo jandhan yojana main har roj bad-chadh kar saikadon khate khol rahe hai, unhen modi kii yojana kii vajah se logon ke gusse kaa shikaar bhi hona pad rahaa he
 Banks do not have any answer from account holders as to why they are not getting insurance cover of 1 lakh and loan of 5 thousand
 patna main bainkon ke adhikari is baat se khaase naaraaz hai ki modi kii jandhan yojana ko jamini taur par amali jama nahin pahanaaya ja rahaa
 This is the reason that accounts are being opened, but till now people are not getting any loan nor insurance facility
 bainkon ke mutabik abtak kisi bank ko 5 hajaar ke overdraft yaa lone dene kaa koi aadesh nahin aayaa he naa hi insurance ko lekar arabiai kii koi guideline ai he
 In such a situation, not only the banks have to face the questions of the people, but the account holders are getting entangled with the bank officials every day

 In December 2017, 41 girls were rescued from the spiritual university of Vijay Vihar in Delhi
 ashramapar aarope tha ki yahaan ladakiyon ko jabardastee bandhak banaakar rakhaa jaataa he
 Surprisingly, after about ten months, now the parents of a girl have come forward and accused the ashram of forcing their daughter
 haryana ke jind se aae danpati kaa aarope he ki aadhyatmik vishvavidhyalay ne jabaran unki 24 saal kii beti ko rakhaa hua he
 Actually, these people used to go to the ashram earlier and believed in Baba
 lekin inkaa kahana he ki jab pichley saal ashram main ho rahe galat kaaryon kaa khulaasa hua, to inhone ashram se saare rishte tod die
 Parents told that for some time, Swati (renamed) was suffering from TB disease
 apane ilaaj ke bahaane 25 sitambar ko rohtak ai or vahaan se ashram chali gai
 The parents say that the people of the ashram informed them that Swati was with them
 jiske baad mata-pita apni beti se milane pahunche
 The parents say that when they meet Swati, they find her completely brainwashed and drugged
 wo ek hi baat dohraye ja rahi thi
 Now the situation is such that Swati does not want to come back
 pita kii maane to phone par baat karne ke saath-saath, swati ne ek NGO ko yah likhakar bhi diya he ki ve apni marji se us ashram main rah rahi he or uske apane mata-pita bhi use vahaan rahane se nahin roak sakate
 Even when Swati's mother cried and begged him to come back, she easily said that if her mother insisted like this, she would tell the ashram people not to talk to her mother
 samajhnaa mushkil he ki kuch hi dinon main swati ke saath aisa kya hua ki ab vah ghar lautnaa hi nahin chaahati
 Significantly, similar allegations were made at this ashram last year as well
 mata pita bataate he ki phone par hui baatcheet main swati ne bataaya ki ashram main uske saath kul 400 ladkiyaan rah rahi hai
 Another surprising thing is that the NGO, with the help of which Swati's parents went, claims that a letter came to them on 5 October, in which they wrote why Swati's parents were finally at the ashram
 Come? Swati is in danger of life from her parents and relatives and a copy of the complaint filed by Swati's parents should be sent to the ashram
 haalanki mata-pita yah kehete hai ki jab unhone is par swati se baatcheet kii, to swati ne kaha ki usne aise kisi kagajaat par dastakhat nahin kiye hai or naa hi use kisi vakil kii jaankaree he
 Let me tell you that this letter looks absolutely fake, which does not have any stamp nor any other official seal
 gauratlab he ki 5 oktober kosibiaine is rohinee sthit ashram main rahane vaali 59 mahilaon ke khilaaf jaanch puri kar court main chargeshit daakhil kii he
 In the final report, the CBI has accused the women employees of the ashram of conspiring and illegally depositing the work of government employees
 is maamle main dillimhila ayogki adhyaksh swati maliwal kaa kahana he ki yah behad durbhagyapurna he ki is tarah ke ashram ko ab tak band nahin kiya gaya
 Maliwal said that she is very ashamed that despite such big revelations by the Women's Commission, neither Baba Virendra Dev Dixit has been caught so far and the ashram is going on like that
 maliwal ne poocha ki CBI ab tak is baba ko kyon nahin pakad pai? unhone aashwaasan diya ki is maamle main dilli mahila ayog karrwai karegi
 Whatever happened in the ashram last year and the new case that has come up now raises some serious questions
 pehla, jis ashram se 41 ladakiyon ko chhudaaya gaya tha, us ashram ko band kyon nahin kiya gaya? ek faraar baba ke ashram main itani mahilaaye kaise rah rahi hai?doosraa, agar ashram ko band he to, to andar rah rahi ladkiyaan or swati jaisi nai ladakeeyon kii suraksha kii jimmedaari koun le rahaa he?teesraa, ashram ke naam par jail kyon chalaaya ja rahaa he? or kya bhagwaan ke upadesh ke naam par aisi baaten sikhaana ki ladkiyaan apane mata-pita se milanaa hi naa chahen, unase baat naa karnaa chahen sahi he?or aakhri sawaal, kya swati ke mata-pita jaise logon kii madad karne ke liye police koi karrwai karegi?

 Cricket is considered a religion in India, and priests of this religion are in crores
 hindustan main log garv se kehete hai ki cricket main unki aatma basati he or unke liye wo khel se kahin upar hai
 The rest of the games and players are in bad shape due to this religion
 is desh main sabase upar cricket heis baat par mujhe koi shaq bhi nahin he ki bharat main cricket kaa darja bahut ooncha he
 All the other sports ahead of cricket, whether it is football, the most played sport in the world, hockey which has made India proud many times on the world stage, or athletics and tennis, all these are far behind
 cricket se zyada garv diya he in khelon nelekin agar ham in khelon ko cricket se tolein to inhone hamen cricket se zyada khushiyaan or acchhee yaaden di hai
 In hockey, we won the Olympic gold medal in a row
 athletics main milkha singh, piti usha, anju bobi jorge or aise tamaam naam hai
 In other sports too, names like Abhinav Bindra, Colonel Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore, Jaspal Rana, Heena Sidhu in shooting
 badminton main number ek sina nehwal, prakaash padukon, pulela gopichand, jwaala gutta
 Leander Paes, Mahesh Bhupathi, Sania Mirza in tennis
 skavaish main deepika pallical, joshna chinappa, saurav ghoshaal
 In wrestling, from KD Jadhav to Sushil Kumar, Karnam Malleswari in weightlifting, Mary Kom, Vijender Singh, Dinko Singh in boxing have many names that have raised the tricolor glory from time to time
 sabase bura haal he hamaari footbal team kaahmaari footbal team jiske 11 khilaadiyon ke naam bhi is desh kii 98 fisadi aabaadi nahin jaanati usne bhi samay-samay par acha khel dikhaaya he
 But in spite of all this, we roam the fingers of cricket played in countable countries
 hamaari footbal team kii ranking girti he ham bina vajah jane apni team ko kosne lagate hai
 Have we ever tried to know why our FIFA ranking falls again and again? Sir, when the team will play only 4-5 matches in a year, then the ranking will also fall against the weaker teams
 media bhi nahin detaa dhyanakya hamen ye sawaal nahin karnaa chahie ki prafull patel kii aguwai vaala ol india footbal federation kya kar rahaa he? agar wo apni team ke liye kuch match bhi nahin yojit kara saktaa to aakhir uski upyogita kya he? hamane kabhi media se poocha ki viraat ke balle ke vajan tak par khabar bana dene vaala hamaara media neshnal footbal team ke world cap kwalifire se pehle camp naa yojit hone par khabar kyon nahin banaata ? hamane kabhi jaanane kii koshish kii ki shotputor indrajit singh ko rio olympic tak pahunchane ke liye paise ikattha karne ke liye online campan chalaane kii naubat kyon ai? har khel association ke sheersh padon par baithe netaa apni jeben bhar rahe hai to ham kyon nahin iske khilaaf aawaaj uthaate? cricket main hamane do worldcup, ek tii20 worldcup or ek champions trophy (jisamen aath desh khelte hai) jiti he
 We are going crazy only on such successes
 opium ke nashe se baahar aana hogakarl marks ne thik hi kaha tha, ‘dharm opium he’ or opium ke nashe main dhutt insaan ko kuch nahin dikhataa
 There is a need to get out of the opium addiction and to support those who play for the tricolor and not those who play for the private limited company
 to mitaron aap privet limited company ke naukaron ko chiyar karo, hamase naa ho paaegaa
 Congratulations on your religion
 mujhe garv he ki main ‘naastik’ hum

 Many times we see homeless people sitting in our expensive vehicles on the road
 kai baar apana maansik santulan kho chuke logon ko bhi sadakon par badahaal ghoomte dekha he
 But for them, we have nothing to give except a few minutes of regret and a few open money
 apni jindagiyon main ham itane uljhe hote hai ki hamen unke chaharon ke peeche chuphi maayusi nahin dikhti, unka dard nahin dikhataa
 But even today, there are people among us who have devoted their entire lives to help such needy people
 gurugram ke ravi kalra unheen main se ek he
 Having given up everything for service, Ravi Kalra has now given up his job of helping the homeless people by giving up their good income jobs that train youth in the defense
 2007 se wo puri tarah isi kaam main jute gaye hai
 Earlier, he used to serve the homeless destitute and those who had lost their mental balance
 aaj inke paas 450 se zyada aise log hai, jinako apano ne thukraa diya he yaa jo halaat ke maare hai
 Ravi Kalra says, 'it was very difficult in the beginning
 ghar waalon ne saath chhod diya
 Quit a good job
 lekin main hameshaa se janata tha ki mujhe ye hi karnaa he
 Today i have been 10 years and i am happy that i am able to do something for others
 'nahin mili sarkari madadsarkaar kii madad kii aas lagaae baithe ravi kabhi bhi paison kii tangi yaa jagah kii kami ke chalate peeche nahin hate
 Initially, his wife and children left him due to many problems
 lekin bina himmat haare aaj ye yahaan tak pahuche hai or yahaan aane vaale har shaks ko apane parivaar kaa hissaa maanate hai
 Now people are joining with them due to this appreciative effort of Ravi
 log kapadon se lekar rashan or rupayon kii madad in tak pahunchaate rahete hai
 The Yadav family of Gurugram have come here to celebrate the birthday of their only granddaughter instead of any big hotel
 unka kahana he ki, 'ham chaahate the ki meri potee or pote main dusron ke liye kuch karne kii bhaavana ho
 Nowadays everyone does their own work
 lekin meri koshish he ki hamaare bachche aise na bane
 Like Ravi Kalra, Rashi Anand has also been involved in giving a dignified life to the needy and connecting them to the mainstream of society
 ye kaam unhone akele hi 7 saal pehle shuru kiya tha or aaj ye dilli ensiaar ke kai badi jhuggi-basti kaa ek janaa pahachaanaa cheharaa hai
 Rashi says, "I felt bad when i used to see young children begging
" maine sochaa liya tha inke liye hi kuch karnaa he
 It is just beginning, it is difficult to juggle these people
 kyon ki ye khud apane bacchon se bheekh mangavate hai
 There is still a lot of work to do
 'red lite par bheekh maangate baccho ko behatarzindagidena or jhuggi basti main rah rahi mahilao ko skill training dena ab raashi kii zindagi kaa lakshya ban gaya he
 After getting a Masters in History Graduate and Event Management, if she wanted, she could have chosen a good income and an easy life by working like a normal girl, but she did not choose this path
 ravi kalra or raashi anand jaise log dusron ke liye misaal hai
 It is not necessary to help someone by robbing them of everything
 ham agar chaahe to zindagi ke kuch pal or thodi seeinsaaniyatkisi ke jivan kii dasha or disha badalane kaa kaam kar sakati he
 The Supreme Court has rejected the plea of manu Sharma, son of senior Congress leader Vinod Sharma, to review the verdict for life imprisonment awarded against him for killing model Jessica Lal 11 years ago

 Vajpayee said this while addressing the people present during the dharna organized against the policy of terrorism and Muslim appeasement of SP in Gorakhpur
 unhone kaha ki aatankwaadi ghatnaon main shaamil aropiyon par se mukademe hataane kaa nirnay sapa ke muslim tushtikaran niti kaa hi nateeja he
 Vajpayee described the SP, BSP and Congress as vote-makers and said that all these parties are venting on the opposition of Hindus in the greed of power and crossing the limits of Muslim appeasement

 1
 bharat or china nepal main apana dabadabaa banane kii koshish karte rahe hai
 In such a situation, choosing India as the PM for his first foreign tour is a diplomatic victory for India
 2
 indo-nepal relations had cooled down during the tenure of former Nepal PM KP Oli
 oli ne aise samjhaute bhi kiye the, jisase bharat ke upar nepal kii nirbharta kam ho sake
 3
 bharat ke alaava nepal main china ke sahyog se bhi kaaphi road or hospitals banaae ja rahe hai
 In such a situation, India will try not to let China establish a unilateral influence on Nepal through its projects
 4
 During Oli's tenure, Nepal entered into an agreement with China to establish the Kathmandu Tarekel network from Tibet
 iske alaava petroleum aayaat ke liye bhi ek samjhauta hua tha
 India is worried about these incidents
 5
 India is still Nepal's largest trade partner

 It is said that the film Amitabh has come to Delhi to shoot is the film of National Award-winning Bangla films director Anirudh Rai Chaudhary
 yah ek saamaajik thriller he
 At the moment the name of this film has not been decided
 shridevi ko is duniya se gaye hue 10 din biit chuke hai
 His family is trying to overcome this sorrow and meanwhile Jahnavi's 21st birthday has also come
 pehali baar jahnavi apana ye janmdin maa ke bina manaaengi
 After all, how will Jahnavi celebrate the birthday amidst the biggest sorrow of her life? Sridevi's step daughter said- 'stop trolling my sisters'
 Sridevi's family has planned to celebrate Jahnavi's 21st birthday
 reports ke mutabik puraa parivaar jahnavi ke liye ek sarprise dinar plan karne vaala he
 Actually, Sridevi also wanted to do something similar on Jahnavi's birthday
 shridevi kii dubai main rukne kii ek vajah ye bhi thi ki vah jaahnvi ke liye shopping karnaa chaahati thim
 Sridevi had done this actress 15 days before her death, according to the wish of phoneshree Devi, birthday celebration bollywoodlife
 com kii report ke mutabik jahnavi apana berthde celibratt kar rahi hai
 Jahnavi will celebrate her birthday in an orphanage
 anaath ashram main janmdin celibratt karne kii reet is parivaar main shridevi ne hi shuru kii thi or ab jahnavi ise jari rakhana chaahati hai
 In a way, it is also a tribute to Jahnavi's mother
 shridevi hameshaa apni betiyon or phans ko pyaar baantne kaa sandesh detii ai hai
 Before the birthday, Jahnavi also posted an emotional letter about his mother's demise on Instagram
 is khat main jahnavi ne kaha tha- maine or khushi ne apni maa ko khoyaa he or papa ne apni jaan
 Jahnavi also thanked the fans for supporting their family in this hour of grief and requested their mother to continue loving them in the same way
 On my birthday, the only thing i ask of all of you is that you love your parents
 Cherish them and devote themselves to making them feel that love
 They have made you
 And i ask that you remember my mother fondly, pray for her soul to rest in peace
 Let the love and adulation you’ll showered on her continue and please know that the biggest part of my mother was the love she shared with papa
 And their love is immortal because there was nothing like it in the whole world
 Nothing as joyful and pure and no two people as devoted to one another as they were
 Please respect that because it hurts to think anyone would ever try to tarnish it
 Preserving the sanctity of what they had would mean the world not only to my mother but also to a man who’s entire being revolved around her, and her two children who are all that remains of their love
 Me and Khushi have lost our mother but papa has lost his "jaan"
 She was so much more than just an actor or a mother or a wife
 She was the ultimate and the best in all these roles
 It mattered a great deal to her to give love and to get love
 For people to be good and gracious and kind
 She didn’t understand frustration or malice or jealousy
 So let's be that
 Let’s be full of only good and give only love
 That would make her happy, to know that even in death, she gave you all something
 The courage and inspiration to fill yourselves with nothing but love and rid yourselves of bitterness in any way and form
 That's what she stood for
 Dignity, strength and innocence
 Thank you for the love and support everyone has shown us in the past couple of days
 It’s given us hope and strength and we can’t thank you all enough
 a post shared byjanhvi Kapoor (@janhvikapoor) onmar 2, 2018 at 10:09 pm PST purv grahamantri or congress ke varisht netaa pi chidambaram ne upie sarkaar main apane kaarykaal ko yaad karte hue kaha, 'mujhe jeevanabhar is baat kaa malaal rahegaa ki main purna bahumat vaali sarkaar main vitt mantri nahin rah sakaa
 He made this statement during a press conference in Ahmedabad
 saath hi modi sarkaar kii nitiyon par bhi gambhir sawaal khadey kiye
 Surrounding the ruling BJP government at the Center, Chidambaram said that development cannot be judged by saying that we are bringing one lakh crore bullet train
 unhone kaha ki surkhiyon main rahakaravikas nahin kiya ja saktabalki swasthya, parivahan, shauchalay or langik samanta jaise kshetron main sudhaar se vikaas kii pahchaan he
 Chidambaram is strongly criticizing the central government's economic policies for the party's campaign
 isi kadi main pichley dinon unhone notebandi ko moorkhtapurna faisla bataaya tha
 Speaking at the special program of 'aaj Tak', Chidambaram said that while announcing the demonetisation on 8 November, PM Modi said that with this one step, black money will be completely destroyed
 chidambaram ne kaha ki pehle notebandi or phir jiesti ne desh main chote-majhole kaarobaari ko nuksaan pahunchaaya he
 According to Chidambaram, the biggest mistake of the Modi government was that it had declared demonetisation as the biggest weapon to eliminate black money
 vahiin benami sampatti par modi sarkaar kii taiyaari par chidambaram ne kaha ki ab dekhnaa he ki vah desh main kitni benami sampatti pakadakar kitne logon ko jail bhajane kaa kaam karte hai
 The Supreme Court has ordered the completion of the work of the National Citizen Register (NRC) in Assam by 31 August
 chif justise ranjan gogoi kii peeth ne assam enarasi ke samanvayak pratik hajela se do took kaha ki vah aalochanaon kii parvaah kiye bagaiyr yah kaam puraa karen
 Because people will keep speaking on NRC
 pichley saal jari enarasi draft main 40 lakh log baahar hue the
 These were people who could not produce evidence related to their citizenship at that time
 unhen baad main enarasi list main naam shaamil karne ke liye dastavej pesh karne kaa mauka mil chukaa he
 All eyes are now on the data of the National Citizen Register, which is going to be published at last
 sawaal he ki kya sabhi 40 lakh log baahar honge yaa phir dastavejon ke pareekshan ke baad tamaam logon ko bhartiya naagarik mana jayega
 On the question of Bangladeshi infiltrators, the Home Minister has said in election rallies that those who are unable to prove citizenship will be sent back
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki dhara 370 ke baad ab enarasi kii antim suchi ke prakaashan ke baad hangaamaa machana tay he
 Because a large number of people are going out due to lack of documents
 sutara bataa rahe hai ki agar ghuspaithiyon ko turant baahar nahin kiya gaya to tab tak yahaan milane vaale unke sabhi adhikari chin liye jaaenge
 The draft of the National Citizen Register (NRC) was published on July 2018
 isamen kul 3
 2 out of 29 crores
 9 karod logon kaa naam shaamil tha
 While 40 lakh people were left
 baad main supreme court ne draft se baahar rahe 10 pratishat logon kaa dobaaraa satyaapan karne kaa aadesh diya tha
 In fact, the court took cognizance of media reports in which a former soldier was also removed from the list
 supreme court kii nigaraanee main assam main enarasi taiyaar karne kaa kaam chal rahaa he
 First to be published by 31 July 2019
 magar kaam puraa na hone par antim samay-seemaa badhaakar 31 agast kar diya gaya he
 During the hearing in the Supreme Court on Thursday, when the Supreme Court summoned the progress report from NRC convenor Prateek Hazela, he said that there were some glitches in the draft, which are to be removed
 is par chif justise ne kaha ki ham 31 agast tak enarasi kaa prakaashan chaahate hai
 Names left out of the lack of documents: Sources associated with the government said that when the draft was ready, a large number of disturbances were revealed
 badi sankhya main assam ke mul nivaasiyon ke naam isliye chhot gaye the ki unke paas saboot ke taur par pesh karne ke liye jaruri dastavej nahin the
 At the same time, many Bangladeshi were able to register their names by colluding with the personnel preparing NRC
 bangladesh kii seemaa se sate jilon main aisi shikaayatein zyada saamne ain
 After which the Supreme Court and the state government decided to conduct a sample test of the draft
 jab 40 lakh log draft se baahar kiye gaye to baad main aapattiyaan lee gayi
 36 to the Coordinator Office to join NRC
 2 lakh aavedan mili
 Why NRC was needed? The insurgency of Bangladeshis in Assam revolted five decades ago
 chah saal lanbaa janandolan chalaa
 This was followed by an agreement, called the Assam Accord 1985
 iske tahat tay hua ki 25 march 1971 tak assam main nivas karne vaale logon ko hi mul nivasee mana jayega
 After this, whatever has been filed will be sent back as invalid
 assam main vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan enarasi ko bijepi ne mudda banaaya tha
 After the formation of BJP government in the state, work on it started from the center level
 haalanki, enarasi main paardarshita sunishchit karne ke liye monitering supreme court kar rahaa he
 Those out of draft have claimed with documents
 ab aakhri list aane par pataa chalegaa ki draft se baahar hue 40 lakh main se kitne logon ke naam shaamil honge
 How many will be evacuated
 centre sarkaar ne spasht kah rakhaa he ki avaidh bangladeshi ghuspaithiyon ko waapas bheja jayega
 This register will include the names of those who will be able to prove that they were born in Assam before March 21, 1971
 dilli kii garmi logon ko rulaa rahi he
 In such a situation, the residents of Delhi are expecting monsoon, but they are also scared
 inke dar kaa kaaran he, jagah- jagah garmi se sadata kooda or khuli hui naaliyaan jinaki sud lene vaala koi nahi he
 The conditions are so bad that if it rains in Delhi now, the blocked drains and rotting garbage in the open for weeks will make it more difficult
 dilli emsidi par lagaataar teesri baar kabza karne ke baad bijepi kaa daawa tha ki 2 maheene main dilli kii saaf-safai durust kar di jaaegi, par jab hamane safai vyavastha kaa jayja liya to paaya halaat main koi sudhaar nahi hua he
 The monsoon can knock at any time, but the garbage and jammed Nalia, which is open all over the city, is still looking for cleanliness
 khule main bhayanak garmi se sad rahaa koodadilli kii garmi rulaa rahi he or saath hi garmi se sadata kooda jeena mushkil kiye hue he
 For the third time in a row, all claims about bjp's cleanliness on MCD are proving hollow
 yun to dilli ke kisi bhi ilaake main aap chale jaaiye khule main bich sadak par sadata kooday kaa dher aapako har taraf dikh jayega, par kai jagahon par koodaydaan thik rihaaish ke saamne hai, jahaan logon kaa kooday kii badboo or machhar, mackhiyon se bura haal he
 Let us give you information about some such areas
 
 
 trilokapuriyaha ilaake kaa kooda jaha ikattha kiya jaataa he, uske thik saamne log rahete hai
 Garbage car comes here once a week and the garbage keeps rotting in the open for the rest of the 6 days, due to which the people are in bad condition
 saath hi makkhi, machhar kii fouj choubison ghante inaki pareshaania badha rahi he
 Small children are sick, they fear what will happen if it rains? During the elections of Dallupura, we had visited all the wards of Delhi
 dilli ke dallupura main bhi hamane logon kii pareshaaniyaan suni thim
 There were Congress councilors here earlier and now BJP
 party badali, cheharaa badla par nahi badali to yahaan ke logon kii kismat
 They were unhappy about the drains cleaning yesterday and are still upset today
 na hi naaliyaan saaf hui, na hi kooda uthaaya gaya
 Open drains are inviting diseases like dengue, malaria, and rotting garbage has made breathing difficult, but no one listens
 madhu viharadilli ke madhu vihaar ilaake main jab ham pahuche to paaya ki zyaadaatar kooda ghar main kooda puri tarah nahi par thodaa bahut saaf kiya gaya he
 When the investigation was done, it was found that the Mayor of East Delhi is on a tour here, due to which there was no cleaning for weeks, there is also a war-level cleaning operation from five in the morning
 logon kaa kahana he barsaat main yahaan halaat bahut bure hote hai, ghutane tak pani bharaa hota he wo bhi kooday se sanaa hua
 In such a situation, diseases are common here
 bijepi ne emsidi chunaavon main chehre badal daawa kiya tha ki is baar dilli kaa swaroop badal jayega, par maujuud halaat or sachai bayaan karatin ye tasviren ye bataane ke liye kaaphi hai ki abhidelli waalon kosaaf gali-muhallon ke liye lanbaa intjaar karnaa hoga

 Fasting is usually associated with reverence and devotion
 vahiin kuch log aise bhi hai jo ye sochakar vrath rakhte hai ki isi bahaane unka vajan kam ho jayega, lekin kam hi logon ko pataa hoga ki vrath karnaa sehat ke liye bahut phydemand he
 Fasting cleanses the toxins present in the body
 iske saath hi pachan kriya bhi pehle se behatar ho jaati he
 These are the 9 reasons on the basis of which we can say that the fasters live a long life
 1
 The fast burning process is accelerated during fasting
 jisase charbi teji se galanaa shuru ho jaati he
 2
 fat cells laptin naam kaa hormone straavit karti hai
 Getting less calories during fasting affects the activation of leptin and reduces weight
 3
 It is necessary to take some essential nutrients during the fast, or fasting may be painful for you
 vrath ke baad aap jab bhi kuch khaaen, koshish karen ki wo paushtik ho na ki fat se bharaa hua, varanaa vajan ghatane ke bajaay bad jayega
 4
 vrath karne se nai rog pratirohak koshikaon ke banane main madad hoti he
 According to experts of the University of South California, it is very beneficial for cancer patients to keep fast
 khaastaur par un marijon ke liye jo chemotherapy le rahe hai
 5
 jaruri nahin he ki jab koi dharmik mauka ho to hi aap vrath karen
 You can fast at any time to cleanse the internal filth and improve digestion
 6
 In many studies, it has been found that keeping pace for some time increases the metabolic rate by 3 to 14 percent
 agar vaaki aisa hi he to isse pachan kriya or calories bern hone main kam vakt lagegaa
 7
 vrath karne sedimag bhi swasth rahata he
 Fasting is beneficial in many problems related to depression and brain
 8
 During the fast, you also get an idea of how wrong your food is
 9
 In today's time, stress is a very big medical problem
 vrath karne setanav main kami aati he

 ”rajak to bataate hai ki lambey samay se guide hone ke baavjood yahaan ke mandiron or murtiyon ke sambandh main kai paryatakon ke jawaab ve bhi nahin de pate the

" shardool (singh) kii akruti agar uttejk murtiyon ke munh ke paas ho to vah man or pairon ke paas ho to buddhi kaa pratik hoti he
 In this context, Bapu said that if the 'work' of the mind goes into the intellect, then a man becomes an animal
 hamaare liye rahasy khul gaye
 "morari Bapu himself said that it took him 55 years to prepare himself to speak on Kama Darshan

 There will also be a grand reception on 12 February
 resepshan rajnikant ke ghar main kiya jayega
 a reception was also held before the wedding
 unke resepshan kii tasviren bhi soshal media par viral ho rahi he
 The couple looked very beautiful in pictures
 maaloom ho ki ye saundarya kii duusari shaadi he
 Earlier, she was married to businessman Ashwani Rajkumar
 lekin shaadi chal nahin pai
 Both filed for divorce in 2017, after which they got divorced
 pehali shaadi se unka ek baccha bhi he
 His son's name is Veda
 veda 4 saal kaa he
 According to an ancient belief, if a woman sees Robin flying on Valentine's Day, then she is married to a sailor, in today's date, she may be someone whose work is transferable
 agar usne goroya dekhi to uski shaadi ek garib ladke se hogi lekin wo taumr uske saath khush rahegi
 At the same time, if a woman looks at the gold finch, then she gets married to the millionaire
 ab aaj kii taarikh main jab pashu pakshiyon ke hi bhavishya par khatra he, to wo bhala hamen hamaara bhavishya yaa khaak bataa paaenge
 And till date we have not seen any other than Robin or Gold Finch
 isliye ham aapako paanch aise tareeke bataate hai jo practical bhi hai or romance se phuli loded bhi
 Do it with your partner on Valentine's Day today, we cannot guarantee it, but we can say with full confidence that because of these, both of you will strengthen your relationship and you will be with them next year too
 isliye ham aapako paanch aise tareeke bataate hai jo practical bhi hai or romance se phuli loded bhi
 Do it with your partner on Valentine's Day today, we cannot guarantee it, but we can say with full confidence that because of these, both of you will strengthen your relationship and you will be with them next year too
 jis tarah mandir or majaaron par mannath maangate vakt to ham dhaage main ganth lagaate hai or khwaahish puri hone par hi use kholte hai, thik usee tarah aap bhi apane partner ke saath milakar ek dori main ganth baandhen, is vaade ke saath ki agle saal isi din aapadonon ise kholenge
 Try to have that knot in front of your eyes every day, which will remind you of this promise
 agar aap donon alag alag rahete hai to do ganth bandhie or apane apane bedroom main diwaar par us dori ko sajaa dijie
 To make it more romantic, ask your partner to also tie a slip with thread on your part stating what gift they will give you next year or how you will get it in your life (husband, boyfriend, soulmate) Want to see lekin aap use padhein nahin, isliye wo us dori se ise achche se sil kar baandh den
 This will prevent the discomfort of reading that slip and eagerly await the next valentine too
 ise or romantic banane ke liye apane saathi se kahen ki wo aapke hisse ke dhaage ke saath ek parchi bhi baandh den jisamen yah likhaa ho ki agle saal wo aapako kya tohfa denge yaa aapako apane jivan main kis rup main (pati, bwoyfriend, solmet) dekhnaa chaahate hai
 But you do not read it, so they seal it with that cord and tie it well
 isse us parchi ko padhane kii bechaini bani rahegi or agle vailemtine kaa bhi besabri se intjaar rahegaa
 i saw Kajol and Ajay Devgan preparing the wish list on the wall of the house in the film 'U Me Aur Hum'
 tarika filmi jarur he, lekin idia solid he
 Why don't you do something similar with your partner this Valentine! If you wish to make a wish list on the wall of the house, then you can do this on cushion covers, coffee mugs, t-shirts too
 baat romance kii ho rahi he to jaahir he car se zyada badhiya sawari he bike kii, vajah to aapako bhi pataa hi he
 The rest of the work will make this pleasant weather of pink cold
 to bas chappal pahanie or unke saath nikal padie ek long drive par
 Take graffiti spray or paint with you
 raste main jis bhi khaas jagah yaa cheez par najar pade use rang daaliye
 Write a message or make a flower leaf, but it must be colored
 saath main apane masterpis ke saath tasviir lenaa naa bhoolen! chaaron mausam jhelane par yani puure ek saal baad wo dikhegaa kaisaa ye jaanane ke liye to aapako vailentains de kaa intjaar jarur rahegaa
 It is said that after the arrival of the child, the husband-wife relationship becomes stronger
 unhen apane relationships ke nae myne mil jate hai
 If both of you do not have a child, then bring home the pet of a pet today
 salbhar ke andar uski dekh bhaal karte karte aap donon ke bich kii bhi nazdikia bad jaaengi, ye tay he
 But do this only if both of you are in favor of keeping pets at home
 aap kisi ko lambey vakt se date kar rahe hai or prapoj karnaa chaahate hai to aaj se badhiya mauka nahin milegaa
 If you propose this year then you will be able to celebrate this day with them next year too

 Mehbooba Mufti, the former Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir and the President of the Peoples Democratic Party, appealed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi today (saturday) to call on Pakistan tehreek-e-insaf (PTI) chief Imran Khan to stop the violence in the state
 Accept the hand of friendship extended from the side
 bataa den ki cricketer se netaa bane imran ne pakistan ke aam chunaavon main apni party kii jeet ke baad pehle saarvajanik sambodhan main kaha tha ki vah bharat ke saath apane rishte sudhaarney ke liye taiyaar hai
 He had said that his government would like the leaders of both sides to resolve all important issues including Kashmir
 neshnal assembly ke chunaavon main sabase badi party ke taur par ubhari pitiai pramukh imran ne is baat par jor diya tha ki donon padosiyon ke bich aarope-pratyarope kaa silsilaa khatm hona chahie
 Mahbubane said this at a rally organized on the 19th Foundation Day of the Peoples Democratic Party (PPP)
 unhone kaha, 'pakistan main nai sarkaar banegi or nayaa pradhanmantri hoga, jisane bharat kii taraf dosti kaa haath badhaayaa he, unhone vaarta kii baat kahi he, main pradhanmantri narendra modi se apil karti hum ki wo is par sakaaratmak jawaab den'unhone kaha, 'yah meraa anurodh he ki hamaare desh ke pradhanmantri ko is maukey kaa phayda uthaakar imran khan kii taraf se kii gai dosti kii peshkash par sakaaratmak jawaab dena chahie
 Mehbooba Mufti said that the upcoming elections should not be an obstacle in starting the process of reconciliation with Pakistan
 unhone kaha ki chunaav to aate-jate rahete hai
 Former Prime Minister of the country, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, extended his hand of friendship towards Pakistan and there was a ceasefire along the border
 yah rajaneta jaise gun hai, aise netaa chunaavon ke bare main nahin balki logon ke bare main sochate hai
 Jammu and Kashmir is the biggest challenge for the Prime Minister of our country
 'mahabuuba mufti ne kaha ki jammu-kashmir kaa mudda sulajhane or rajya main khoonkharaab khatm karne vaale pradhanmantri kaa naam itihaas main sunahare aksharon main likhaa jayega
 PDP leader Muzaffar Baig threatened to speak, while speaking at this event, PDP leader Muzaffar Begne even threatened
 is kaarykram main bolte hue unhone kaha, 'desh main gaay or bhens ke naam par musalamaanon ke katl band karen, varanaa nattejey achche nahin honge
 a partition has already taken place in 1947
 ' CBI reached my home for search
 yah bhaajapa kii soshal media ranneeti hi thi, jisaki tikshnata, jiske vyaavhaarik gyaan or jisaki prachandta kii tarif 2014 se kii ja rahi he
 But for the past few weeks, the trolls on social media and effectively making fun of the opposition have also got the hands of the opposition, BJP is also uncomfortable
 pichley maheene, bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah ne ahmedabad main ek 'tounhall' meeting main yuvaaon ko party ke khilaaf soshal media abhiyaanon ko nazarandaaj karne ke liye kaha
 Shah said about the anti-bjp propaganda spreading on whatsapp and Facebook, "I want you to use your mind
" ''lekin abhi tak koi bhi yah kehane ke liye taiyaar nahin he ki lahar bhaajapa ke khilaaf chal padi he
 Certainly not in Gujarat at all
 lekin bhaajapa ko online lakshith karne ke congress or anya vipakshi partiyon ke thos prayaas apana asar chhod rahe hai
 Rahul Gandhi, who has been the target of a lot of trolling, has added one million followers on Twitter in the last two months
 kuch vishleshkon kaa tark he ki yah soshal media main congress kii badhati upasthiti kaa parinaam he
 Ajendra Tripathi, who is active in social media, says that he also sees a shift in carefully reading the comments on ministers' tweets that the usual glut of jubilant admiration is now combated by more sarcasm, more distrust
 Happening
 14 se 30 sitambar ke bich, treepathi ne 60,000 twits kaa vishleshan kiya or paaya ki pradhanmantri narendra modi ke bare main ausatan 18 nakaaratmak twits har ghante aa rahe hai, 11 nakaaratmak twits vitt mantri arun jetali ke khilaaf, bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah or videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj ke khilaaf 8-8 or grih mantri rajnath singh ke khilaaf 6 twits prati ghanta hai
 For this boom, a social media campaign of the Congress in Gujarat is being credited as 'vikas Gando Thayo Che', which means Vikas has gone mad
 congress ke sibar cell ke pramukh rohan gupta ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha ki 45 log 24 ghante kaam kar rahe hai, taaki soshal media par is sandesh kaa vaastavik arth spasht kiya ja sake
 They are using meme and viral videos and comedies, such as a closed bus, with the hashtag 'vikas Gaya Gaya' for maximum impact
 ek anya utsaahi soshal media yujar viraag gupta ke anusaar, congress kaa abhiyaan pramanik prathit hota he, is par aane vaali pratikriyaayein vaastavik handles vaale vaastavik logon se ai hai, na ki bots (ek software) yaa party ke kaaryakartaaon se, jo bani-banaai pratikriyaaon ko ritvit kar dete hai
 The BJP has launched its own campaign, 'hu Vikas Chu, Hu Chu Gujarat'
 iskaa uddeshy sabhi ke liye vikaas pradaan karne ke bhaajapa ke daavon par, tathakthith 'gujarat model' par, dhyaan kendrit karnaa he, jisane 2014 main modi ko pradhanmantri kii kursi tak pahunchaaya tha
 Apparently, Rahul Gandhi's multi-fold follow-up is also only one-tenth of what Modi is following
 bhaajapa ke ity guru amit malviya bataate hai ki pichley do varshon main fasebuk par party kii folowing 70 lakh se badhkar 130 lakh se adhik ho gai he
 About 70 lakh people follow the party on Twitter
 iskaa arth he ki bhaajapa kii ore se yojit koi bhi soshal media abhiyaan ek vishaal sankhya main logon tak pahunchataa he
 Malaviya says, the opposition may get a brief upsurge through negativity, "but our positive, fact-based campaign will eventually emerge victorious
" ''malviya kii ranneeti 'vikaas pagal ho gaya he' ke meme se sidhi takkar lenaa or ise nakli samachar ke rup main chitrit karnaa he
 Despite the shocking Congress's social media campaign, the bjp's difficulties in Gujarat are more serious, they are related to caste matters and to the Patidar movement
 rahul gandhi ne mukhyamantri vijay roopaani or unki sarkaar par parformens ke abhaav ko lekar prabhavi dhang se hamalaa kiya
 This worried the party so much that it sent players like Jaitley and Defense Minister Nirmala Sitharaman into the fray
 ve us kaaryshaala main shaamil the, jo bhaajapa ke gujarat ke netaaon ko yah dikhaane ke liye dizin kii gai thi ki ve soshal media kaa apane laabh ke liye kaise istemaal karen
 Rupani also participated in this session
 ek sutara ne kaha, ''isamen online yuddh main pakade jane kii kam gunjaaish he
 The opposition is trying to get BJP leaders to talk about rising prices or cow-related violence or GST, but we have not asked them to go into the controversy
 '' PDP President Mehbooba Mufti on Monday described Pakistan as a party to the Kashmir issue and advocated the involvement of the neighboring country to resolve the issue
 mufti ne apane twitor acount par endie sarkaar ke duusare kaarykaal main bane grahamantri amit shah par hamalaa kiya he
 He accused Union Home Minister Amit Shah of resorting to "barbaric force" for a speedy solution to the problem and said it would be absurd
 is par gautam gambhir ne bhi karaara jawaab diya he
 Gautam replied in the same way to Mehbooba Mufti
 While i am all for a talk-based solution to Kashmir problem but for @mehboobamufti to term Shri @amitshah's process as “brute” is “ridiculously naive”
 History has been witness to our patience and endurance
 But if oppression ensures security for my people, then so be it
 Newly elected MP Gautam Gambhir tweeted, "while we are all talking for a solution to the Kashmir problem, it is ridiculous for Mehbooba Mufti to call Amit Shah's process" cruel "
 itihaas hamaare dhairya or dhiraj kaa gavaah rahaa he
 But if persecution ensures safety for my people, then so be it
 '' isse pehle mahabuuba mufti ne twit kiya tha
 He wrote, "since 1947, various governments have been looking at Kashmir from the perspective of security
 yah ek raajnneetik samasya he or pakistan sahit sabhi pakshon ko shaamil karte hue iske raajnneetik hal kii jarurat he
 '' Since 1947, Kashmir's been looked through the prism of security by successive governments
 It's a political problem that needs a political redressal by involving all stakeholders inc Pak
 Expecting a quick fix through brute force by newly appointed HM is ridiculously naive
 On Monday, Home Minister Amit Shah took stock of the country's internal security situation in New Delhi, where he was also apprised of the situation in Jammu and Kashmir
 bataa den, amit shah (amit Shah) ne somvaar ko suraksha balon ko spasht nirdesh die ki ve kisi bhi aalochana se prabhavit na hon or jiro tolerance kii niti jari rakhen

 'if God does not want then why do you want to forcibly visit?' While hearing a petition filed against the non-entry of women in Kerala's Sabarimala temple, the Supreme Court has questioned that if on the basis of tradition, the institute will admit women What's wrong with not wanting to give? The Hindu has placed this news on the first page
 khabar ke mutabik, court ne mahilaon kii ore se pesh hue vakil se sawaal kiya ki agar bhagwaan khud nahin chaahate ki mahilaayein unki puja karen, yaa darshan karen, to aap unhen kyon majaboor karnaa chaahate hai? iske jawaab main vakil ne kaha ki yah niyam mandir kii dekharekh karne vaale logon ne banaaya he
 Under this, the entry of women of a specified age limit is prohibited, which is discrimination against them
 mau vidhansabha kshetra main bahubali mukhtaar ansaari basapa ke tikat se chunaav maidan main hai
 After being disrespected from the SP, there is pressure on them to save their seats, but at the same time they also have the burden of Mayawati's hopes
 jail main rahete hue ve apni seat or mayawati kii ummiido par kaise khare utarate hai, yah bada sawaal he, kyonki ve is baar bijepi ke nishane par hai
 The Prime Minister himself called him Bahubali in the public meeting of Mau and said that he has fielded his 'katappa' to end this 'bahubali'
 katappa isliye kaha kyonki is seat par bhaajapa ne rajbharon kii party bhartiya samaaj party ke ummidavaar ko gathbandhan ke tahat utaara he
 The candidate of Bhaspa who is in the election field is Mahendra Rajbhar
 mahendra 2012 ke chunaav main mukhtaar ke saath the or unhone apni birdari ke vot dilaane main ahm bhoomika nibhaai thi
 But this time he himself is in front of them
 modi ne kaha ki ye hamaare katappa hai
 Mukhtar Ansari is in jail
 ve puure chunaav main nahin aa sakate lihaaja prachaar kii kaman unke chote bete umr ansaari ne khud sanbhali he
 Earlier, Omar and his supporters hoped that Mukhtar would get parole, but now he himself put all the emphasis
 mukhtaar ke prachaar kii kaman sanbhaalane vaale kehete hai ki sarkaar chaahe jitani koshish kar le or unhen kshetra main na aane de par janata unhen baari voton se jeet dilaaegi
 Mukhtar has won from Mau in the last two elections as an independent candidate under the banner of his party, Qaumi Ekta Dal
 is baar jeet pakki karne ke lihaaj se samaajawaadee party main apni party kaa vilay tak kar liya, lekin yadav parivaar main machi mahabharat ke baad alag ho gaye or hathi ke saathi ban gaye
 Mayawati not only held a huge rally in favor of Mukhtar but also gave a befitting reply to the statements of PM Modi
 mayawati ne mau kii raily main ab tak kaa sabase lanbaa bhaashan, takreeban do ghante tak diya
 The Prime Minister called Mukhtar as Bahubali and said that after winning the election, the people will be stamped that they are not Bahubali
 tippaniyan In fact, the need for support for Mukhtar this time was because the BJP was making inroads into the vote bank of the dominant castes in the area
 mukhtaar ke mukaable main usne rajbhar samaaj ke ummidavaar ko maidan main utaara he, jinaki yahaan acchhee aabaadi he
 The alliance of the SP and the Congress can also become a roadblock for Mukhtar's victory
 is rode ko zyaada dhar dete hue pradhanmantri ne yahaan kii jansabha main elaan bhi kiya ki bahubali ke khilaaf hamane katappa ko utaara he, jo bahubali ko khatm kar degaa
 It is clear that the path is not easy for Mukhtar in this election
 pehle sahare ke liye talash, phir perol ke liye ladaai or ab jeet ke liye sangharsh, saath hi mayawati kii ummiden
 And this expectation of Mayawati is dependent on 'M'
 yani mau, mukhtaar, mayawati or muslim
 
 
 Now it will tell the result of the election, how much this factor went
 mukhtaar ansaari jail main hai
 He cannot come for the entire election, so his younger son Umar Ansari himself has commanded the campaign
 pehle umr or unke samarthakon ko ummid thi ki mukhtaar ko perol mil jaaegi, par ab khud hi sara jor laga diya
 Those who command Mukhtar's campaign say that the public will win them by huge votes, whatever the government tries and does not allow them to come into the region
 mukhtaar mau se pichley do chunaav main apni party kaumi ekta dal ke binar se bataur nirdaleey ummidavaar jeet chuke hai
 This time, to ensure victory, he even merged his party with the Samajwadi Party, but broke into the Yadav family after the Mahabharata and became an elephant's companion
 mayawati ne mukhtaar ke paksh main na sirf vishaal raily kii balki piem modi ke bayanon kaa munhtod jawaab bhi diya
 Mayawati gave the longest speech ever at the Mau rally for nearly two hours
 pradhanmantri ne mukhtaar ko bahubali kaha or kaha ki chunaav jeetne ke baad janata kii mohar lag jaaegi ki ve bahubali nahin hai
 The comments darasal mukhtaar ke liye is baar sahare kii jarurat is vajah se padi kyonki bijepi ilaake main asar rakhane vaali jatiyon ke vot bank main apni paith bana rahi thi
 In comparison to Mukhtar, he has fielded a candidate from Rajbhar society, who has a good population here
 sapa or congress kaa gathbandhan bhi mukhtaar kii jeet kii raah kaa roda ban saktaa he
 Giving more edge to this road, the Prime Minister also announced in a public meeting here that we have launched Katappa against Bahubali, which will eliminate Bahubali
 saaf he ki is chunaav main mukhtaar ke liye raah aasaan nahin he
 First the quest for support, then the fight for parole and now the struggle for victory, as well as Mayawati's hopes
 or mayawati kii yah ummid 'em' ke bharose he
 That is, Mau, Mukhtar, Mayawati and Muslim
 
 
 ab yah to chunaav kaa nateeja hi batayega ki yah factor kitna chalaa

 In the second match of the Carlton Mid Tri Series played in Brisbane, Shikhar Dhawan was dismissed in the third over against England
 ab prashansakon kii nigahen pavilion kii taraf thi
 Kautuhl was whether vice-captain Virat Kohli would come to bat at his favorite number three? But came Ambati Rayudu

 This includes one century and three half-centuries
 batting order main badlaav kiye jane se kohli ke form par to asar nahin padataa dikh rahaa lekin team ko isse faaede ke badale nuksaan ho rahaa he
 But the thinking of the captain and the team management is different
 dhoni kaa kahana he, 'shuruaati wicket jaldi girane par hi viraat ko number-chaar par bheja jaataa he
 The effort is that they go to bat only in the 12th or 13th over
 vahaan se bhi vah badi saajhedaari kar sakate hai

 team india is samay westeindies daure main vanade siries khel rahi he
 After the first match was washed out by rain, he won two matches and also took a 2–0 lead in the series
 ab vah ravivaar ko windies ke saath chauthaa vanade khelegi
 At the beginning of the tour, it was believed that captain Virat Kohli would do some experimentation in the team and give opportunities to young players, but Virat preferred to go with the regular team
 tisare vanade se pehle to viraat kohli ne team main badlaav ke sanket bhi die the
 Obviously, young Rishabh Pant, who is considered to be the successor of MS Dhoni, must have been excited, but he did not get a chance
 ab chauthe vanade se pehle bhi viraat ne kuch aisa hi sanket diya he
 Will have to see if they implement it or not
 viraat kohli ne tisare vanade main team ke shandaar pradarshan par khushi jaahir karte hue plaing ilevan main kuch badlaav ke sanket die hai
 This is expected to give a chance to those players who have not played in the current series against the West Indies
 rishabh pant, dinesh karthik or mohammad shami ko ab tak khilne kaa mauka nahin mila he
 However, considering the preparation for the 2019 World Cup, it will be good for the team to experiment against a weak team like the Windies

 In such a situation, they can be given a chance
 aise main team main emes dhoni ke uttaradhikari maane ja rahe wicketiper ballebaaj rishabh pant ko bhi jagah mil sakati he
 The comments plaing ilevan main badlaav ke sanket par kohli ne kaha, 'ham nishchit taur par is par (badlaav karne par) gaur karenge
 We have some players who have not got a chance to play for some time
 ' However, Virat Kohli gave young spinner Kuldeep Yadav a chance to debut and he also left his mark
 rishabh pant ko lekar bhi viraat ne sanket diya tha, lekin tisare vanade main unhen nahin liya
 Significantly, Pant is also a wicketkeeper and his style is aggressive
 mana ja rahaa he ki dhoni ke ritairement ke baad vah team main bilkul feet baithenge
 Virat Kohli, while expressing happiness over the team's great performance in the third ODI, has indicated some changes in the playing eleven
 isse un khilaadiyon ko mauka milane kii ummid he, jo westeindies ke khilaaf maujuuda siries main ab tak nahin khele hai

 On the issue of meeting the President, Tyagi said that TMC held talks with other parties but after taking time from the President
 mamata ji ne nitish ji se bhi baat ki he par sabko saath samay lenaa chahie tha
 Its ally Shiv Sena has also created problems for the government

 However, Kejriwal has objected to Shiv Sena joining in March
 kejariwal ne mamata banerjee se kaha ki virdohi march main shivasena shaamil hui to aap saath nahin degi
 On Kejriwal's terms, TMC MP Derek o'brien said that it is up to the other parties that what they do, Mamta has raised public problems

 Australian captain Steve Smith offered his IPL teammate Ajinkya Rahane and other players of the Indian team beer after the series

 After which Rahane did not accept the offer

 Significantly, there was a lot of bitterness in this series of four Test matches between the two countries

 However, Smith also apologized after the series ended for not keeping his emotions under control

 modi sarkaar ne dhan kii emspi main record 200 rupee prati quintal kii badhotaree kar di he, lekin isse bhi kisaan khush nahin hai
 In 2014 itself, the Bharatiya Janata Party had promised that it would fix the minimum support price (MSP) of crops as per the Swaminathan Commission report
 desh main loksabhaa chunaav ke liye taiyaari shuru ho chuki he, aise main modi sarkaar ke is faisle ko chunaav se jodakar dekha ja rahaa he
 The announcement of a major increase in MSP of crops was expected to provide relief to the farmers
 vitt mantri arun jetali ne bajet main hi isaki ghoshnaa kii thi
 Farmers were hoping that the Prime Minister would adopt a more lenient view of the recommendations of the Swaminathan Commission, at least during the election year
 modi sarkaar ne vaisaa hi kiya he jaisaa 2014 ke aam chunaavon se pehle saal 2012-13 main upie-2 kii sarkaar ne kiya tha
 The UPA government then increased the MSP of paddy by Rs 170 per quintal
 yah bhi tab ek saal main kii gai record badhat thi
 The Agricultural Costs and Pricing Commission (CACP) has calculated the MSP for the 14 major kharif season crops for 2018-19 based on last year's cost
 isliye sabase pramukh masalaa to yahi he ki yah record badhat bhi kisaanon ke liye khaas kargar nahin he, kyonki is bich dhan ke paidaavaar kii laagat main kaaphi badhat ho chuki he
 The huge increase in cost due to GST has led to an increase in the price of diesel by Rs 8 per liter in the last one year
 isi tarah jiesti ke lagu hone ke baad khaad par 5 fisadi tex, krishi mashinari par 18 fisadi tex laga diya gaya he, jisase boj or bad gaya he
 Prior to GST, states used to impose tax on fertilizer from zero to 6 percent
 yahi nahin kitnashak, kharpatvaar naashak aadi par pehle 5 se 7 fisadi kaa waite lagata tha, lekin ab in 18 fisadi kaa jiesti laga diya gaya he
 In the calculation method, before the GST, farmers of states like Punjab, Haryana etc
 did not have to pay any tax or VAT on chemical fertilizers (fertilizers) or pesticides
 siesipi ne 14 fasalon ke liye jis tarah se emspi kii gananaa kii he, usase log santusht nahin hai
 There is a huge difference in the actual value of the cost plus the imputed value (A2 + FL) of family labor and comprehensive accounting (C2) of interest on land and immovable property owned
 ye thi kisaanon kii mangasarkaar ne nunatam samarthan mulya ke liye A2 +FL se 50 fisadi zyada keemat rakhkar gananaa karne kaa nayaa benchmark tay kiya he, jabaki kisaan swaminathan ayog kii sifarish ke mutabik C2+ 50 fisadi kii maang kar rahe hai
 If calculated according to C2 + 50 per cent, the MSP of paddy would have been at least Rs 2340, which is currently Rs 1750
 isi tarah makka kii emspi 1700 kii jagah 2220, kapaas kii emspi 5150 kii jagah 6771 aursurajamukhi kiemespi 5,388 kii jagah 6,751 rupee prati quintal kerani padati
 Bollywood actress Deepika Padukone remains in the headlines for her tattoos along with acting
 kuch saalon pehle deepika jab ranbir kapur ke saath relationships main thim to unhone apane gale par unke naam kii tatu banavaakar pyaar kaa khulaa izhaar kiya tha
 According to the news of the film magazine 'filmfare', Deepika is thinking of getting another tattoo on her beautiful body soon
 magazine ke mutabik deepika ne nae tatu kaa idia apane najdiki mitra homi adzania se saajha kii he
 Homi made the film 'cocktail' with Deepika
 deepika ne apane takhne par bhi ek tatu banavaa rakhaa he
 But for now, eyes are on whether Deepika's new tattoo design will be designed or whether Deepika will get a 'special' name tattooed because it is being said that these days Deepika and actor Ranveer Singh have become closer

 Donald Trump's refusal to accuse Trump of insisting on the President of Ukraine
 The formal process of impeachment against US President Donald Trump has begun

 Although the process of impeachment will be completed in the lower house, it is difficult to pass the Senate with a majority of Republicans
 america raashtrapati donald trump ke khilaaf mahabhiyog kii prakriya shuru ho gai he
 Trump is alleged to have pressured Ukraine's President, Vladimir Zalensky, to initiate a corruption investigation against Trump's Democratic rival Joe Biden and his son
 haalanki donald trump ne in aaropon se saaf inkaar kiya he
 The impeachment process against Trump is completed in the lower house, yet it is difficult for Republicans to pass the Senate with a majority
 donald trump ko america raashtrapati ke pad se hataane ke liye 20 republican saansadon kii jarurat hogi, jo apane raashtrapati kaa hi vidroh karen
 Significantly, former Vice President Joe Biden can compete in Trump in the US presidential election in 2020
 media reports ke mutabik trump ne mana he ki unhone jelensky se biden ke bare main charchaa kii thi, lekin unpar jo aarope lag rahe hai vah galat he
 The process of impeachment in America is the bicameral legislature of the federal government of America called the US Congress
 seenet (senate) or pratinidhi sabha (house of Representatives) iske do sadan hai
 According to the US Constitution, the process of impeachment against the President can be started after a majority in the House of Representatives
 raashtrapati ke alaava asainya adhikari yaa phir prantiy sarkaar ke khilaaf bhi mahabhiyog laayaa ja saktaa he
 Impeachment on any of these is brought when they are suspected of being involved in treason, bribe or any major crime
 agar aisa hota he to sadan kii nyaayik samiti in aaropon kii jaanch karti he
 The charges are then decided upon consent
 in aaropon par sadan main voting hoti he
 If the voting is in favor of impeachment, then the article is handed over to the Senate
 phir seenet court kii tarah kaam karti he or yues ke mukhya nyaayadhish isaki adhyakshata karte hai
 a manager is appointed from among the senators for the hearing
 is trial ke dauraan aaropee apana paksh rakhata he
 The Senate votes on every article of impeachment after both parties have completed their hearings
 is voting main agar do tihaai sadsy aaropee ko doshi maanate hai to dosha siddh ho jaataa he
 Then the Senate can sentence them
 kehete hai vakt meharbaan ho to insaan kii kismat badalane main der nahin lagati

 Magsaysay Award winner and noted social activist Sandeep Pandey has been removed from the post of professor at the Cobanaras Hindu University (BHU), accused of being involved in Naxalism and anti-national activities
 ye faisla biechayu ke board of governors kii ek meeting main liya gaya tha jisko lekar aadhikarik aadesh guuruuvaar shaam jari kiya
 In fact, Sandeep Pandey was accused of being sympathetic to the Naxalites and scheduling a screening of a documentary made on Nirbhaya which was banned in India although he canceled it after BHU proctor objected
 sandip pandey ne khud par lage aaropon ko khaarij karte hue maamla court tak le jane or manahani kaa mukadmaa karne kii dhamkee di he
 He has said that if he is truly anti-national and Naxalite, then the university should file a case against him and send him to jail
 kulapati kii yogyata par uthaaya sawalsandip pandey kaa aarope he ki vishvavidhyalay ne unhen nikaalane kaa faisla aresas kii maansikta se grast ho kar liya he
 Pandey has described the Board of Governors as affiliated to the RSS and even alleged that Vice Chancellor GC Tripathi is in fact not eligible to become a VC
 unka kahana he ki elahabaad uniwarsity main arthshaastra caprofessorarahate hue unhone varshon se koi kaam nahin kiya he or na hi unke naam se koi nayaa paper publish hua he
 Sandeep Pandey accused the Union Human Resource Ministry of imposing Tripathi as the Vice Chancellor and as the Chairman of the Board of Governors
 sandip pandey ne kahi ye baaten--aresas ke log anargal aarope laga rahe hai
 i say if the allegations are true then i should be sent to jail
 nirbhaya par ek documentry jise bharat sarkaar ne bain kar diya tha use main apni kaksha main dikhaanaa chahta tha kyonki main chahta tha ki mahilaon ke khilaaf aparaadh par charchaa ho
 But at the behest of the proctor and the police, i did not show them
 haalanki charchaa hui or ek duusari documentry dikhaai gai
 So on this basis, he calls me involved in anti-national activities
 - main vichaardhaara se gandhivadi hum
 i am not a Naxalite but the reason Naxalites become Naxalites means poverty, non-equal issues
 in muddon par main bhi kaam karata hum
 There is a difference in the methods
 wo hinsa kii baat sweekaar karte hai ham log ahimsak dhang se wo kaam karte hai
 i believe that his point is just right; there is a disagreement with his methods of doing things
 - aresas waalon ko hi zyada pareshaani he mujhase
 In fact, the danger to me is that what i work for is between the students and the surrounding villages and the handlers
 inako lagata he ki agar main na rahun to shaayad ye log inaki shakhaon main jaaenge or inke kaamon se judenge
 They pose an ideological threat to me
 - ye ashishnutaa kaa hi maamla he
 There are people with RSS who do not accept disagreements, let alone protest
 ye chaahate hai ki sirf ek soch waalon kaa shaikshanik sansthaanon par kabja rahe
 People visiting there should follow their ideology
 lekin wo baantne vaali jo vichaardhaara he jisamen hinsa ke beej hai ye desh kaise bhul saktaa he ki yahi vichaardhaara mahatma gandhi kii hatya ke liejimmedaarhe
 - i will not go to court for my job, because i was on contract there for a year
 haalanki ye meraa teesraa saal tha or main or padhaanaa chahta tha
 Now circumstances have arisen to remove me, so i will teach the children elsewhere
 - main soochna ke adhikaar ke tahat us meeting ke minutes nikalavaaoongaa jahaan mere upar naksalwadi or deshadrohi hone kaa aarope lagaaya gaya
 And if i get that action, then of course the three professors, including the vice chancellor, will sue me for defamation

 When the poems were tied up, even if you consider contemporary poetry to be modern, you are left behind even decades, because poetry has left the modern era and has entered the crisis of poetry, now there are no bhats, no more in poetry There are no voices of depression and worry, no tears, blood, sweat
 vampanthi swar che vaali tii-shart main simatakar rah gaya he
 Poetry has become Facebookist, poetry has become a staple of share, it is surprising that even after so much change, Muktik is in poetic demand, the poem has become so free that the previous lines have left the next free, the words move online and You cannot find meaning kavita kii e-durgati ke peeche kii vajah kavy-prakaash he jahaan kavy teen prakaar ke kahe gaye, dhwani, gunibhoot vyangy or chitra
 Unable to understand the first two things, the newborn poets took the target of the third type and as a result there was a lot of pictures with poetry, neither was it epic nor Khandakavya nor Champukavya, some even call it 'shero-shayari' Well, depending on the form, you can call it visual poetry and management poetry because visual because there was a lot of emphasis on 'showing', what to do if words do not understand visual poetry
 In addition to the characters, the costumes, gestures, motifs, actions and acting of the characters make the audience happy
 And the arrangement is that after searching the 'desi' blog after two lines, one can find a picture of the champagne with 'shero-shayari', the poet writes the poem later Badanughadu 'manages' the photo first

 As a result, the poem became erotic, it was the sexualization of poetry

 EVM machines were easier than ballot boxes, their storage, calculations etc
 were all better, so they started to be used
 lagbhag 15 saalon se ye bhartiya chunaavon kaa hissaa bani hui he

 lekin in falon or mithaiyon main asaram kii niyat or najar kaa wo jehar mila hota he, jisapar kabhi asaram ke bhootpurv sadhak ungali uthaate hai to kabhi kanoon ke rakhwale
 The tilism of Asaram's shameless code language was also strange
 kabhi ankhon se ishaare kar, to kabhi prasad main kaashew khilaakar asaram ladakiyon ko jogan bana dete
 The world would think of it as a saint's pastimes and change the world of girls
 jogi ke pyaar main jogan ke luutane kaa filmi gaanaa jab satsang ke pravachan main aa jaae to phir is sawaal kaa jawaab wo kodeward denge, jinase asaram ke ekantavaas ke saare taale khul jaaenge
 Asaram's codeword number 1 - Torch Jahan must be the light of religion, where the darkness of a girl's ruin came from that flashlight, causing Asaram to throw light on a girl sitting in a satsang thrice
 asaram ke purv sevak ke mutabik, is lite kaa ishaara ye hota tha ki asaram ke liye us ladki ko sevadaar taiyaar karen
 Asaram's codeword number 2 - If there was no flashlight, Asaram used to talk about bringing the girl to attention
 pravachan sunne aae bhakton ko lagata tha ki baba to dhyaan kii baat kar rahe hai, jabaki baba kaa dhyaan to kahin or hota tha
 But Prajapati Asaram's disciples understood what his master wanted
 asaram kaa code number 3 - mirakabhi asaram ke satsang or dharmik sabhaaon main hissaa lene vaale ab unki pole khol rahe hai
 Asaram was called a girl by the name Meera
 ab mira bana diya to khud ko krishna bataane vaale asaram ke liye us ladki kaa brainwash karne main jute jate the kareebi sevadaar
 Asaram's code number 4 - The old seeker of Joganbaba says that Asaram, who sang the songs of Jogi Jogan, used to keep an eye on girls from 12 years to 20 years
 inamen jo ladki pasand aa jaae, use baar-baar jogan kahkar pukaarane lagate the
 With this, his servants could understand how black Baba's intentions were sitting in a white cloth
 asaram kaa kodeward number 5 - kaashew-badamasaram ke pravachan ke pandal main prasad bhi haisiyat se tay hota tha
 The one who used to offer so much, he got cashew-almonds
 lekin prajapati ke mutabik, agar kisi ladki par asaram kii nazren gad gayi to use wo prasad main kaashew-baadaam dete the
 It was enough for close servants to indicate what Asaram wanted
 asaram kaa kodeward number 6 - samarpandharm kii aad main adharm kii dukaan chale to usamen kharid-farokht ke liye imaan kii jagah nahin hoti
 Believe in the accusations, Asaram's dedication to the satsang meant that the girl who liked him, to seduce him and prepare him for Asaram
 asaram kaa kodeward number 7 - ekantavasadharm kii duniya main ekantavaas to vahaan hota he jahaan bhakt or bhagwaan ke bich koi nahin hota
 But Asaram is accused of being a hangout of his recruits
 besharmi kii duniya main asaram kuch itane aage nikal chuke the ki unki jindagi hi lagbhag code verde main simat kar rah gai thi
 The last three numbers of Asaram's mobile phone were 400
 asaram ne apane phone kaa code verde bana rakhaa tha 400
 People understand that Baba does not keep a phone and Baba used to talk openly to his special disciples at number 400
 asaram kaa code verde 400asaram ke bare main ye nayaa khulaasa kiya he, us jodhpur police ne, jo unke khilaaf yon shoshan ke iljaamon kii tafteesh kar rahi he
 According to the police, Asaram's mobile number was 9321 *** 400 and he used to call it 400 in short form
 shilpi, shipa, sharathchandra jaise asaram ke raajadaar ko jab bhi asaram se baat kerani hoti, to wo ek duusare ko 400 number par baat karne kii baat kehete
 Moreover, talking to 400 numbers meant getting the last order for any work
 vaise to ye mobile asaram ke rasoiye ke paas hota tha or vahi ye phone uthaata tha, lekin use ye phone sunne kii ijaajat nahin thi
 That is, his job was to pick up the phone and put it in Asaram's ears
 police ne apni chaanbin main paaya he ki jab se peedit ladki ko fansaakar asaram kii kutiyaa tak laane kii sajeesh shuru hui, tab se lekar asaram or baaki muljimon yani shilpa, shiva or sharat kii asaram ke isi 400 number bahut zyada yani tisiyon baar baatcheet hui
 According to the police, Asaram used to do almost everything to hide his handiwork
 or to or har ladki or sadhak ko bhi unhone alag-alag naam de rakhe the
 He used to call his disciple Sanchita as Shilpi and he started calling the victim girl a jatti
 kehete hai bhagwaan apane bhakton main koi fark nahin karata
 But Asaram, who described himself as an incarnation of God, not only differentiated his devotees, but also offered them offerings according to the status or appearance of the devotees
 yani jitani badi dakshina, utana badhiya prasad
 And if Dakshina is of Surat and dedication then what about Prasad
 baba ke ek puraane raajadaar kii maane to asaram unke pair chune vaale bhakton ko aam taur par prasad main chanaa diya karte the, lekin jo bhakt unka pair chune ke saath-saath unhen 10 rupye kaa dakshina bhi detaa tha, asaram use chanaa ke saath-saath shakkar yaa gud bhi de dete the
 And just like this, as the amount of Dakshina kept increasing, Baba's prasad also became good
 jo bhakt asaram ko sau rupye kaa dakshina detaa, asaram use fal dete or jo paanch hajaar rupye saunpta unhen kaashew, jabaki isse zyada dakshina denevaale ko asaram apane haathon se mithaiyon kaa packet thama dete
 Apparently, Asaram's prasad was also distributed not on the basis of devotion or devotion to the devotee, but on the basis of his status
 lekin hakeekat yahi thi ki jab kisi ladki ko baba uski dakshina nahin, balki surat par jaakar kaashew yaa mithai kaa prasad dete the, to iskaa matlab kuch or hota tha
 And this meant the well-to-do operatives of Asaram knew a lot

 The government believes that due to the politics on this issue, it does not have to give any proof to the operation of the army beyond the line of control
 saaf he ki sarkaar sargical strike par ho rahi raajnneeti main philhal nahin padegi
 The government is apprehensive that after the surgical strike, the stinging Pakistan could lead to a major terrorist incident during the festival days

 abhinayta ajay devgan abhinit film drishyam kii tarj par dilli main hue ek murder kaa sansanikhej khulaasa hua he
 a few days ago, Monica, whose body was found in a Fortuner car, has no one else but her husband Lalit
 usne apni patni kaa 8 lakh kii supaari dekar katl karvaa diya
 That too just because Lalit stuttered while talking and Monica used to laugh at his stuttering, which she does not like
 dilli police ke ritred sab inspector kuldeep singh kii sabase choti beti monica kii shaadi gudgaanv ke dhawapur gaanv ke rahane vaale lalit se hui thi
 Kuldeep Singh spent all his life in the marriage of the younger daughter
 dahej main fortuner car diya
 Everything went well for a few days after the wedding
 donon ko ek beti bhi paidaa hui
 She lovingly named him Disha, but Monica did not stop making fun of Lalit's stutter
 is baat se naaraaz hokar ek din lalit ne faisla kar liya ki wo monica kii hansi hameshaa ke liye chin legaa
 He gave Monica the betel nut to a contract killer named Shaheen
 maut kaa sauda 8 lakh main tay hua
 Endwas given 50 thousand rupees
 iske baad katl kii taarikh 19 april tay hoti he
 Fine does the mockdryl rehearsal of murder
 lekin 19 april ko contract killer nahin pahunchaa, to wo ek baar or mocodrill karata hafilm drishyam kii tarah murder kaa reharsal20 april ko fortuner car main reharsal ke hisaab se wo monica or apni 3 maheene kii beti ko lekar nikalataa he
 There the contrax killers shoot Monica
 iske baad jo hota he, uski kahani ajay devgan kii film drishyam se match khaati he
 The way Ajay Degan lives that story in order to hide a murder
 thik usee tarah lalit ne bhi kiya
 So that in the police interrogation, he and his family should speak there, which they have done
 fortuner car main mili thi monica kii lashriharsal ke mutabik lalit fortuner ko said main khadaa karata he
 Leaving the car as an excuse to be fresh and goes away
 supaari killer shaheen aata he, monica ko goli martha he
 He escapes on the bike
 iske baad lalit dilli police ko phone karata he
 He told the police, 'on the afternoon of April 20, i was returning from my house in Gurgaon with my wife and daughter to my mother-in-law, Delhi's Chawla
 raste main gaadi ko start chhodkar fresh hone ke liye gaya
 The husband narrated to the police the story of the murder
 Lalit further said, 'by the time i returned to my car, i was forced to press the accelerator of the car and heard the loud sound of firing
 peeche mudate hi maine dekha ki meri gaadi se ek noujvaan utarkar bhaag rahaa he
 When i tried to catch the young man, he also tried to shoot me, but it did not happen by chance
 itane main wo ladkaa duusare ladke saath bike par faraar ho gaya
 Everything happened so quickly that there was no opportunity to understand
 'ek sach ne kiya murder mistry kaa pardaafashlalit ne murder kii reharsal to kar lee, lekin ek sach uskaa pardaafash kar degaa, ye usne sochaa nahin tha
 For the police, this murder was nothing short of a mystery
 sabase bada sawaal tha ki ek housewif kii kisi se kya dushmani ho sakati he
 So the police started working on the new theory
 donon ke kol ditels nikaale
 Started investigating isse ye saaf ho gaya ki lalit ne bhaade ke hatyaron se sampark kiya tha
 His relationship with his wife was also not going well
 majaak bardaasht nahin hua to kara di hatyasasuraal waalon kaa shaq bhi puri tarah se damaad par tha
 After this, the police strictly questioned Lalit in custody, in which he opened his tongue
 usne bataaya ki monica uski hakalaahat kaa mazaaq banaati thi
 He used to laugh, which he could not tolerate
 isi khunnas main usne apni bivi ke katl kii supaari de di
 In this way, Lalit remained adamant on the rehearsal plan like the film Darsham, but could not hide the truth of the past
