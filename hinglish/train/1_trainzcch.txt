 The government's most important ordinance land acquisition bill is implicated in the Rajya Sabha
 halaat ye hai ki sarkaar ke paas abhi bhoomi adhigrahan ke do bill hai, ek bill jo rajyasabha main pesh he or doosraa wo bill jise loksabhaa paas kar chuki he
 Due to lack of majority in Rajya Sabha, the government has failed to withdraw the land acquisition bill and now a strange situation has arisen
 sarkaar main dikkat ye he ki unki apni sahyogi shiv sena bhi is bill ke saath nahin he
 In such a situation, the government is eyeing the opposition
 sarkaar kii najar bispi or samaajawaadee party par jarur he, magar baaki vipaksh ne bhi ranneeti bana rakhi he or apni ekajutata kaa pradarshan karne ke liye sansad se raashtrapati bhawan tak paidal march karne kaa faisla kiya he
 The government has very few options
 ek to sarkaar bajet satr ko thodaa badaye or aam raay banane kii koshish kare, magar isaki sambhaavna kam dikhti he kyonki vipaksh bhoomi adhigrahan bill ko select kamity bhejnaa chahta he
 The government has another way to end the Rajya Sabha session and bring an ordinance, but the budget is also to be passed in Rajya Sabha, so the government is hesitant to take this decision
 vaise sarkaar ke paas adhyadesh laane ke alaava koi chaara nahin he
 Yet the same question is posed as to how the land acquisition bill will pass
 sarkaar chaahegi ki vipaksh rajyasabha main jo bhoomi bill he use select kamity ko bheja jaae or uski report kaa intjaar kiya
 In the meantime, the government can operate through the ordinance
 bajet satr kaa aglaa hissaa ek maheene baad shuru hoga tab tak select kamity kii report nahin aa paaegi
 The Rajya Sabha will pass the bill that comes from the Select Committee
 phir wo bill loksabhaa jayega jahaan use paas kiya jayega
 The problem with the government is also that the Rajya Sabha has not rejected the land bill through rejection or voting, so the government cannot even call a joint session, that is, there is a mountain-like problem in front of the government and the opposition has faced a big issue

 bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne kendriya vitt mantri arun jetali ke khilaaf aam aadmi party ke saare aaropon ko 'bebuniyaad or sachai se pare' bataate hue kaha ki party unke saath ekajutata ke saath khadi he or unka apmaan karne kii kisi bhi sajeesh ko safal nahin hone diya jayega
 While standing with Jaitley, Amit Shah also questioned the legality of Delhi's Arvind Kejriwal government setting up a commission of inquiry
 bijepi adhyaksh ne 'aap' par prahaar karte hue kaha ki yadi ise ('aap' ko) lagata he ki yah apni durbhaavnapurna koshishon ke jariye jetali kii chhavi ko nuksaan pahunchaa sakati he, to yah din main sapane dekhne jaisaa he
 Such efforts will adversely affect AAP and the party's image will be tarnished
 amit shah ne ek bayaan main kaha, jetali ke khilaaf lagaae gaye saare aarope bebuniyaad hai or unka sachai se dur-dur tak koi naata nahin he
 It is a conspiracy to insult Jaitley
 bijepi unke saath ekajute he or unke apmaan kii kisi bhi koshish ko safal nahin hone diya jayega
 He said that Jaitley's entire life is like an open book and has been devoted to the country
 unke khilaaf is tarah ke aarope lagaana samaj se pare he, kyonki esaio ne didisie ke kaamkaaj main unki kisi bhi tarah kii sanliptata hone ko pehle hi khaarij kar diya he
 The comments 'aap' or dilli sarkaar dwaara jetali par kiye gaye tikhe hamale ke maddenjar amit shah kaa bayaan aayaa he
 AAP has demanded his resignation over the alleged financial irregularities during Jaitley's 13-year tenure as DDCA chief between 1999 and 2013
 amit shah ne ayog or iske kshetradhikaar par sawaal uthaate hue aashcharya jataayaa ki didisie kaa kaamkaaj ek-sadasyeey ayog ke daayre main kaise aa saktaa he, yah kanoonee bahes kaa vishay he
 He also called the idea of diverting the aap's move to constitute a commission and call a special session of the Delhi Assembly about it

 The BJP president attacked AAP saying that if it ('AAP') feels that it can harm Jaitley's image through its malicious efforts, then it is like daydreaming
 aisi koshishon kaa ulte 'aap' par hi asar padegaa or party kii chhavi dhoomil hogi
 Amit Shah said in a statement that all the allegations against Jaitley are baseless and he has no connection with the truth
 yah jetali kaa apmaan karne kii sajeesh he
 The BJP is united with them and any attempt to insult them will not be allowed to succeed
 unhone kaha ki jetali kaa puraa jivan ek khuli kitaab kii tarah he or desh ke prati samarpit rahaa he
 It is unthinkable to make such allegations against him, as the SFIO has already dismissed any involvement of him in the functioning of DDCA
 tippaniyan Amit Shah's statement has come in the wake of the sharp attack on Jaitley by AAP and Delhi government

 The letter further states that in such a situation, when the employment growth rate has slowed down, the entry of foreign super markets will further worsen the employment situation
 patr main kaha gaya he ki ham sarkaar se aagrah karte hai ki khudara kaarobaar main epadiai ko bilkul anumati na di jaae

 The question is what was the scale of choosing these companies? The basic criterion was that the business in India should be 75 years old, from which the list was made, we sorted out the different companies either old or market leading
 banking jaise kshetron ke liye, jahaan niamak bandishon ke kaaran kaarobaari aakaar kii simaaen hoti hai, hamane usee kshetra kii duusari bahurashtriya companiyon ke saath tulana karte hue yaa to sabase puraani yaa phir sabase acha pradarshan karne vaali company ko chunaa

 After the Indian Air Force air strike at jaish-e-mohammed's bases in Pakistan, the chain of fake news on social media has once again intensified
 fasebuk par ek mahila payalat kii tasviir teji se viral ho rahi he
 It is being claimed that the female pilot seen in the picture is named Anita Sharma and she also participated in this air strike
 is post kaarkivd varjanayahaan dekha ja saktaa he
 The India Today anti-fake News War Room (AFWA) found in its investigation that the photograph is of Indian Air Force fighter pilot a Vani Chaturvedi
 fasebuk pej"main gauputra hum"ne yah tasviir post karte hue capshan main likhaa: "anitha sharma pakistan main ghuskar 300 aatankwaadiyon ko maarane vaali stri shakti, airforce mahila sainik, is bhartiya sherni ko badhai
 This picture is also being shared from the "facebook page" Modi Mania "and" Sare Jahan Ka Dil "
 khabar likhe jane tak is tasviir ko alag alag fasebuk pej se 2500 se zyada baar share kiya ja chukaa tha
 To find out the truth of the picture going viral, when we did a reverse search, we found that the name of the female pilot seen in the picture is not Ani Sharma and a Vani Chaturvedi
 farvari 2018 main bhartiya vayusena kii fiter payalat avani chaturvedi mig 21 bison ladaaku vimaan akele udaane vaali pehali bhartiya mahila bani thim
 At that time several reputed media institutions including Ajatak had published this news prominently
 padtaal main spasht hua ki viral ho rahi tasviir bhartiya vayusena kii fiter payalat avani chaturvedi kii he
 However, whether Avni was part of this air strike team or not is not known
 aamtaur par is tarah ke oparation main hissaa lene vaale sainikon ke naam jag jaahir nahin kiye jate hai
 The Indian Air Force and the Government of India have also kept secret the names of the officials who took part in the entire operation that took place on 26 February
 is vajah se ye kahana sahi nahin he ki kisi mahila adhikari ne is oparation main hissaa liya
 If you think that the government is reducing the rate of GST on all things but you do not get the benefit, then your suspicion is absolutely correct
 sarkaar ko bhi aisi tamaam shikaayatein mili hai ki jiesti main kami kaa phayda companiyaan or dukandaar graahakon tak nahin pahunchaa rahe hai or tex kam hone ke baad bhi kai chijen sasti nahin ho rahi hai
 But now the government has made arrangements to tighten the profits of profiteers under the guise of GST
 guuruuvaar ko cabinet main jiesti ke liye anti profitring othority (enee) ke gathan ko manjuuri de di
 It will immediately restore a chairman and technical members
 enee kaa kaam hi hoga is baat kii nigaraanee karnaa ki jo log jiesti main tex katautee kaa phayda graahakon tak pahunchane ke bajaay khud hadap rahe hai unke khilaaf karrwai kii jaae
 Since 15 November, reduced GST rates have been applied on all things, including reducing GST from 5 per cent to 18 per cent on eating in restaurants
 cabinut ke faislon ke bare main jaankaree dete hue kendriya mantri ravishankar prasad ne bataaya ki haal main hi sarkaar ne jiesti ke rate main jabardast kami karte hue 59 chizon ko chhodkar aam aadmi ke kaam aane vaali zyaadaatar chizon ko 28 fisadi jiesti ke daayre se baahar kar diya he
 Many things have now been brought under the category of lowest 5 percent tax
 iske baad anti profitring othority (enee) kaa gathan karke sarkaar ne yah saaf kar diya he ki sarkaar har haal main kam tex kaa phayda aam logon tak pahunchane ke liye vachanabaddh he
 This will be the format of NAA
 If people feel that they are not getting the benefit of tax in GST, then they will be able to complain to the anti-profiting Authority (NAA)
 enee kaa pramukh ek sachiv str kaa adhikari hoga or isamen chaar technical members hogen jo kendra se yaa rajyon se ho sakate hai
 In addition to the anti-profiting Authority (NAA) at the center, there will be a standing committee and screening committee in all states
 kaise hogi shikayabgar kisi graahak ko lagata he ki jiesti kaa phayda use nahin mil rahaa he to wo apane rajya main screening cameti main isaki shikaayat kar saktaa he
 But if there is a case of profiteering that affects a lot of people or it can affect the entire country, then a complaint can also be made directly to the Standing Committee
 shikayaton par jaanch kaa kaam sibiisi ke tahat aane vaale diarector general of sefgards karke enee ko saunpenge jiske aadhaar par uchit karrwai kii jaaegi
 GST registration can be canceled, if the complaint is found to be true, it can either order to reduce the price of things and can also impose a fine if the matter becomes very serious
 behad sangeen maamalon main jiesti kaa registration bhi radd kiya ja saktaa he
 Though there is no peace on the indo-pakistan border, the expectations of the heads of the two countries to meet during the SAARC conference have gained momentum
 nepal kii rajdhani kathmandu main 26 november ko hone vaale saarc sammelan main pakistan ke pradhanmantri navaj sharif or bhartiya pradhanmantri narendra modi kii mulaakaat ho sakati he
 According to the news of 'the Indian Express', looking at the prospects of nawaz-modi at the SAARC conference, Foreign Ministry spokesman Akbaruddin said that India has always favored peaceful relations with Pakistan
 piem modi saarc deshon ke pramukhon se arthpurna samvaad karne ke liye taiyaar hai
 PM will try to improve the relationship through these dialogues
 sutron ke mutabik, navaj sharif or piem modi kii mulaakaat aupchaarik nahin hogi
 The chiefs of the two countries may meet on the schedule of the SAARC conference
 akbaruddin ne bataaya ki baithkon kaa shedul taiyaar ho gaya he
 Our effort is to solve problems with the meetings during SAARC
 udhar, paak videsh mantralay kii ore se kaha gaya he ki saarc sammelan ke maukey par sharif deshon ke raashtra pramukhon se bhi milenge
 Through these meetings, PM Sharif will try to improve regional problems and bilateral relations
 gauratlab he ki isse pehle khabaren aa rahi thi ki saarc sammelan ke dauraan piem modi or navaj sharif ke bich koi dwipaksheeya vaarta nahin hogi
 Recently, the news of the death of three people due to fire during the charging of e-rickshaws had shocked everyone, in this accident many were scorched when it was investigated that it was found that e-rickshaws were illegal Charges were being made in the house after which a short circuit occurred and a fire broke out
 ab is maamle main ek nayaa mode saamne aayaa he, khabar he ki sarkaron ne i rickshaw ko regularaies karaane kaa to kaam to kar diya par iske eendhan kaa vyavastha karnaa bhul gai, yahi vajah he ki hajaaron i-rickshaw sadak par gum rahe he par unke charging kii vyavastha kahin nahin he
 As a result, the rickshaw driver is forced to charge illegally at the charging point
 charging karne vaale vasuulate he manamaana chargekai rickshaw chalko kaa kahana he praivet jagah rickshaw ko charge karana padataa he jisamen wo log manamaane dhang se paise vasuulate he
 There is danger in this as well as electricity theft
 aapako bataa den ki dilli kii sadakon main lagbhag ek lakh i rickshaw chal rahe hai jisamen se 70 fisadi se zyada avaidh rup se sadak par he
 Bicycle rickshaw drivers standing near RK Ashram in Delhi are waiting for their ride
 Rickshaw drivers say that the governments have allowed the e-rickshaws to run on the road but did not say where the charges will be from
 As a result, the e-rickshaw charging point running illegally has to be charged with mafia by giving arbitrary demand
 vahiin i-rickshaw union kaa kahana he sarkaar ko jald petrol pump kii tarj par charging point banane chahie keval vot bank palitics karne se kuch nahin hoga
 It is obvious that the incident happened in the past, due to this reason, in such a situation, there is a need to take strict steps immediately by the government

 bhartiya antariksh anusandhan sanghathan (ISRO) kaa doosraa moon mishan Chandrayaan-2 safaltaapurvak launch ho gaya he
 Chandrayaan-2 on July 22 at 2 pm
 43 baje desh ke sabase taqatvar bahubali rocket GSLV-MK3 se launch kiya gaya
 Now the 48-day journey of Chandrayaan-2 to reach the south pole of the moon has started
 kareeb 16
 23 minutes later, Chandrayaan-2 will detach from the GSLV-MK3 rocket at an altitude of about 182 km from the Earth and start circling in the Earth's orbit
 chandrayan-2 ke 48 din kii yatra ke vibhinn padaavchandyan-2 antariksh yaan 22 july se lekar 13 agast tak prithvi ke chaaron taraf chakkar lagayegaa
 After this, from August 13 to August 19, he will travel in a long orbit going towards the moon
 19 agast ko hi yah chand kii kaksha main pahonchega
 After this, he will revolve around the moon for 13 days or till 31 August
 phir 1 sitambar ko vikram lander orbitor se alag ho jayega or chand ke dakshini dhruv kii taraf yatra shuru karegaa
 After a 5-day journey, on 6 September, the Vikram lander will land on the south pole of the moon
 landing ke kareeb 4 ghante baad rover pragyan lander se nikalakar chand kii sataha par vibhinn prayog karne ke liye utrega
 Learn
 
 
 15 july kii lonching or 22 july kii lonching main kya antar aayaa1
 The time for the Earth to go into the orbit has been increased by about one minute
 July 22: Chandrayaan-2 is now 974
 30 second (kareeb 16
 231) in 181 from Earth
 65 kimi kii oonchai par pahonchega
 July 15: Then 973 on Chandrayaan-2
 70 second (kareeb 16
 221) from Earth in 181
 61 kimi par janaa tha
 2
 prithvi ke chaaron taraf andakaar chakkar main badlaav, apoji main 60
 4 km difference July 22: Chandrayaan-2 will revolve around the Earth in an elliptical orbit after launching
 isaki periji (prithvi se kam duuri) 170 kimi or apoji (prithvi se zyada duuri) 39120 kimi hogi
 July 15: Chandrayaan-2 would launch if its 170
 06 kimi or apoji 39059
 Would have been 60 km
 yani apoji main 60
 a difference of 4 km has been brought
 yani prithvi ke chaaron taraf lagane vaala chakkar kam kiya jayega

 chandrayan-2 kii chand par jane ke samay main kii gai 6 din kii katautiagar 15 july ko chandrayan-2 safaltaapurvak launch hota to vah 6 sitambar ko chand ke dakshini dhruv par land karata
 But after today's launching, Chandrayaan-2 will take 48 days to reach the moon
 yani chandrayan-2 chand par 6 sitambar ko hi pahonchega
 For this, ISRO scientist Chandrayaan-2 will have to cut the circle around the earth
 sambhawatah ab chandrayan-2 prithvi ke chaaron taraf 5 ke bajaay 4 chakkar hi lagaae

 chandrayan-2 kii velocity main 1
 With the increase of 12 meters per second, Chandrayaan-2, after its launch on July 22, will now go towards the moon much faster
 ab antariksh main isaki gati 10305
 78 meters per second
 jabaki, 15 july ko launch hota to yah 10,304
 At a speed of 66 meters per second, he went towards the moon
 yani isaki gati main 1
 12 meters per second has been increased
 isro ke liye kyon ahm he chandrayan-2 mishan, paanch bade kaaran1
 Demonstrating Scientific Efficiency - When Russia refused, ISRO scientists created the lander-rovernovember 2007 in which Russian space agency Rosskosmos said it would work together in the project
 vah isro ko lander degaa
 In 2008, the mission received approval from the government
 2009 main chandrayan-2 kaa dizin taiyaar kar liya gaya
 The launch was scheduled in January 2013, but the Russian space agency rosscosmos lander could not deliver
 isro ne chandrayan-2 kii lonching march 2018 tay kii
 But for some tests, the launch was postponed to April 2018 and then to October 2018
 is bich, june 2018 main isro ne faisla liya ki kuch badlaav karke chandrayan-2 kii lonching janvari 2019 main kii jaaegi
 Then the launch date was extended to February 2019
 april 2019 main bhi lonching kii khabar ai thi
 It will be clear from the success of this mission that our scientists are not in love with anyone
 ve koi bhi mishan puraa kar sakate hai
 2
 isro kaa chota sa kadam, bharat kii chhavi banane kii lambii chalaantpane duusare moon mishan chandrayan-2 ke saath ISRO antariksh vigyaan kii duniya main ho saktaa he ki chota kadam rakh rahaa ho, lekin yah bharat kii chhavi banane ke liye ek lambii chalaang sabit ho sakati he
 Because so far only five countries of the world have been able to get a soft landing on the moon
 ye desh hai - america, rus, europe, china or japan
 After this, India will be the sixth country to do so
 haalanki, rover utaarne ke maamle main chauthaa desh he
 Earlier, America, Russia and China had landed lander and rover on the moon
 3
 Choosing the Hardest Place: Choose the place on the moon where no country has yet arrived
 According to Isro, Chandrayaan is the 2nd Indian moon mission that will land in the south pole region of the moon with full courage where no country has reached yet - ie the moon's Southern Polar Region

 Munde had removed the word 'BJP' from his Twitter introduction a day earlier, with Munday posting a post on Facebook about his "future journey" in view of the changed political scenario in Maharashtra, as well as speculation about his next move in politics
 The market was heated
 unhone somvaar ko apane twitor baio se ‘bhaajapa' or apane raajnneetik safar kaa vivaran hataakar afvaahon ko or bal de diya tha

 har kisi kaa khwab hota he ek sapanom kaa ashiana
 When the dream is destined for a dream, a human being shifts into it as soon as possible
 lekin, udyogpati mukesh ambani ne aisa nahin kiya
 It has been almost a year since his dream palace Antilla in South Mumbai was built, but Mukesh Ambani did not shift there completely
 chunki, is par mukesh yaa reliance kii ore se kabhi kuch nahin kaha gaya, lihaaja atakalon kaa daur shuru ho gaya he
 The beauty of Mukesh's palace is such that the visitors can be stunned
 yah vishaal itnaa he ki mahal ke thik neeche khadey ho jaaen, to manjilon ko ginana mushkil ho jaae
 Some people even call it the Taj Mahal of the twenty-first century
 aise main bhala koun hoga jo is khubasurat sapanom ke ashiyane main naa rahanaa chaahe
 But, there are reports that even after the entry of Antilla in the house on October 28 last year, the owner of this house, Mukesh Ambani and his family is not completely shifted here
 sapanom kaa mahal taiyaar hone ke baavjood mukesh ab tak yahaan puri tarah rahane ke liye kyon nahin aae hai, ise lekar atakalon kaa daur shuru ho gaya he
 Questions are arising that why Mukesh Ambani did not shift to the dream palace? Is there any Vastu defect in Antilla? Does Mukesh Ambani not stay in Antilla because of Vastu defects? The answer is yes
 ek akhbaar main chhapi khabar ke mutabik vaastudosh kii vajah se mukesh ambani antila banane ke kareeb salbhar baad bhi vahaan puri taraf shift nahin ho paae hai
 There is speculation that negative energy is coming to the palace due to Vastu defects
 ashanka he ki negative energy rishton main daraar daal saktaa he
 There is speculation that negative energies are communicating from the south-west part of the palace, which may create discord among the people living there
 unke bich maamuli baat par bhi matbhed ho sakate hai
 Perhaps this is why Mukesh Ambani is away from his palace
 mukesh ambani apni patni nita ambani or teen bacchon ke saath abhi bhi apane puraane si-wind ashiyane main rahete hai
 The family of his mother and his younger brother Anil Ambani also reside in the 14-storey Sea Wind Ashiana
 gauratlab he ki pichley saal jab grihpravesh hua tha to us din havan or vishesh puja ke liye darjanon pandit bulaae gaye the
 Even big industrialists joined the party given on the day of homecoming
 khabar he ki building main kaam karne vaale karmchaariyon ko oberoi group prashikshit kar rahaa he, taaki vahaan aane vaale mehmaanon kii khatirdaari main koi kasar naa rahe
 But, Antilla still awaits his master
 antila main mukesh ambani or unka parivaar puri tarah shift kyon nahin ho rahaa he, is par naa to reliance group kii ore se koi aadhikarik bayaan diya gaya he, naa hi ambani parivaar is par kuch kehane ko taiyaar he
 Whenever a Reliance spokesperson was asked a question about this, he postponed it as a personal matter
 akhbaar main chhapi khabar ke mutabik mukesh ambani ke kareebi bhi is par zyada kuch kahana nahin chaahate
 However, according to the newspaper one of his friends says that the Ambani family had spent a few nights there
 jaahir he aise main yakini taur par ye kahana mushkil he ki antila main mukesh ambani ke naa rahane kii vajah vaastudosh hi he
 Since the Reliance Group and the Ambani family are not ready to say anything about this, speculation abounds and Vastu Dosh is the most discussed among these speculations

 Aaj Tak's Exit Seated Exactly in maharashtra-haryana The hung assembly in Polhariyana had expressed the exact same in the Lok Sabha elections
 The picture of Exit Polhariyana and Maharashtra Legislative Assembly elections is almost clear now
 maharashtra main bhaajapa-shivasena kii jodi ek baar phir satta par kabiz hone ja rahi he to vahiin haryana main trishanku vidhansabha ke asaar dikh rahe hai
 The BJP is far from majority, while the Congress is trying to come back to power with other parties
 donon rajyon ko lekar ajtak-exis maay india ne apana jo agsit pole jari kiya tha, vah bilkul sateek baitha he
 Be it the BJP-SS alliance or the possibility of a hung assembly in Haryana
 ise padhein: exis maai india ne bataaya, kyon ajtak ne ek din baad dikhaaya haryana kaa EXIT pollajawaka-exis maai india kaa agsit pole donon rajyon main nateezon ke kareeb rahaa he, jabaki anya agenciyon kaa agsit pole dur-dur tak sateek nahin baitha
 Earlier, something similar had happened in the Lok Sabha elections, when the exit poll of Axis My India was accurate state by state
 haryana kaa rigelt: BJP: 40, Cong: 31, JJP: 10, Others: 09haryana main kya tha ajtak kaa agsit polabijepi: 32-44congress: 30-42jejepi: 6-10anya: 6-10republic-jan kii batbijepi ko 52-63congress ko 15-19jejepi 5-9inelo 0-1anya 7-9abeepibijepi 72congress 8anya 10sienen-news18 ipsosbijepi 75congress 15times naubijepi 71congress 11anya 8tivi9-sisero agsit polabijepi 69congress 11anya 10haryana ke alaava maharashtra kaa agsit pole bhi sateek baitha he
 According to the Maharashtra results, the bjp-shiv Sena government is set to be formed
 kai agsit pole main bhaajapa-shivasena kii jodi ko 200 se adhik siten di gai thim, lekin ajtak ke agsit pole main ye aankada 166 se shuru hua tha
 In such a situation, the exit poll of Aaj tak-axis My India is the most accurate

 yahaan tak ki soshal media par is gane se judaa ek chalange bhi trend kar rahaa he, jiske tahat logon ko is song par dance karnaa hota he
 Along with the common people, the Bollywood stars also completed this challenge well
 pehle ayushmaan khurana (ayushmann Khurrana) ne is gane par dance kar akshay kumaar (akshay Kumar) kaa dil khush kar diya tha
 So right now Bollywood actor Kamal r Khan also performed the dance on 'shaita Ka Saala', which he also shared the video from his Twitter handle
 My dance on Shaitan Ka Sala song of # Housefull4! @akshaykumar@riteishdpic
 twitter
 com / 6fs9oqh35ekamala aar khan (kamaal r Khan) kaa yah dance video khub viral ho rahaa he
 The special thing is that on this song of Kamal r Khan (KRK), 'housefull 4' actor Ritesh Deshmukh (riteish Deshmukh) has also given his reaction
 ritesh deshmukh ne kamaal aar khan ke dance par twit karte hue likhaa, 'bhai, aapke saare video main se yah meraa sabase pasandida video ban gaya he
 After Ritesh Deshmukh's comment, KRK also reprinted him

 co / bvyqfvfvdabawa den ki akshay kumaar (akshay Kumar), ritesh deshmukh (riteish Deshmukh), bobi deol (bobby Deol), kriti senon (kriti Sanon) starer film 'housephul 4' (housefull 4) 26 oktober ko relies hone ja rahi he
 The budget of the film is said to be around 75 crores
 khaas baat yah he ki 'housephul' siries kii pehali teen filmon ko pasand kiya gaya he, or is baar dabl role ke jariye kamedi kaa tadakaa lagane kii koshish kii gai he
 However, there are a lot of reactions on social media about the film, and mimes are also being made
 aap khud main khoe rahane vaale ek gaiyr jimmedaar ladke ke saath kar bhi kya sakate hai, jo sirf apane fauladi seene or filmi manoranjan ke liye adarsh bhavamudra par dhyaan detaa ho, jo apni maa, bahan va garlfriend ke bal par safalataa paata ho tathaa dosti ke liye sab kuch nyochaavar kar detaa ho
 The romantic story of a boy with similar character is 'I am and I' which has a lot to laugh about
 is film main jon abraham ne ek aise atmamugdh kirdaar ko nibhaayaa he jo apane jivan main kabhi bhi girane ke liye taiyaar rahata he
 'I Me and I' is the story of a corporate environment where women are allowed to succeed just like men, even if that success comes at any cost
 isiilie anoushka (chitrangada) dwaara ishan (jon abraham) ko uske kamare main hi nahin, balki jivan main bhi akelaa chhod dene par kisi ko aashcharya nahin hota
 Ishaan also moves to a new apartment without losing time where he starts flirting with Gauri (prachi Desai) who lives in the next apartment
 bhartiya film industry ke liye yah behad khatarnaak shuruyaat he
 None of the characters in the film have risen above the story
 in sabake bich ek kirdaar sabase rochak ban padaa he, vah he ishan kii stylish bos binaa (rima sen) kaa jo puure bijness par kabja kar leti he or ishan ko uske haal par chhodkar chal detii he
 It is interesting to see John in an ugly, characterless character that you would not like to see with your daughter or sister
 jon ne bina kisi jhijak ke kirdaar ko nibhaayaa he
 Songs go anywhere in the film
 vastav main ‘ai me or main’ ek acchhee romantic kamedi he jo ek matlabi ladke or uske jivan main aane vaali do khubasurat mahilaon kii kahani he
 Wednesday was going to be a step and trough for parliamentary decorum
 mauka tha raashtrapati ke abhibhaashan par rajyasabha main pradhanmantri narendra modi ke dhanyavad bhaashan kaa
 But this resulted in the weakening of parliamentary dignities amid boycott and sarcastic remarks of the House
 apnedhanyavad bhaashan main pradhanmantrine vipaksh par nishaanaa saadhaa
 Even personal comments on members were in the Prime Minister's speech
 kai baar to aisa bhi hua ki pradhanmantri yah tak bhul gaye ki wo sadan main hai or unhen logon ko nahin, chair ko mukhaatib rahete hue apana sambodhan dena he
 Taking a bath in a raincoat in the bathroom, someone learns from Manmohan: The Prime Minister's statement was dubbed by many opposition mps in the House till the election speech
 aisa hua bhi kyonki bhaashan ke kai hisse aise the jinhen pradhanmantri apni chunavi reliyon ke bolte rahe hai
 Such things, such facts were present in this speech, which were like political statements rather than thanks and answers to the questions of mps
 aahat uparashtrapatisbase dukhad yah rahaa ki donon hi pakshon ne sadan ke sabhapati, uparashtrapati hamid ansaari tak par aarope madhe
 While the mps of the ruling party said that there is such a negative atmosphere in the house during your stay, the leaders of the opposition also accused the party of citing rules
 pradhanmantri ke bhaashan ke ant main hamid ansaari ne apni chair se uthakar sadan ko sambodhit karte hue kaha, “maine aap dopaher kii kaarywahi ko kaaphi takalif ke saath dekha
 i do not want to accuse any one, because if we look at this whole episode, then all the members of the House (ruling and opposition) will have to share the charge of this painful situation
 ”iske baad dhanyavad bhaashan par voting kii prakriya shuru hui
 But the way the Vice President also faced the comments and behavior of the members, he left the House before voting
 sadan main voting kaa kaam upasabhapati courian kii upasthiti main puraa hua
 At the time of voting on the President's address, no Opposition MP was present in the House to vote on the amendment proposals
 aakhir tak sabhi saansad walkout kar chuke the
 This was an embarrassing situation for the government and parliamentary process in the House
 pradhanmantri kii garima ghatiaisa kam hi hua he ki sadan main kisi pradhanmantri ko itane ugr or vyaktigat hamale karte hue pehle kabhi dekha gaya ho
 Such personal attacks were never seen in the House before, especially while giving a statement on the vote of thanks
 'renkot' atake ko lekar PM modi ke khilaaf rajyasabha main narebajipradhanmantri ne sadan ke varishthatam sadasyon main se ek, manmohan singh ke bare main yah tak tippanee kar daali ki wo renkot pahanakar bathroom main nahaane kii kala main daksh hai
 This made the Congress mps very angry and then all party mps including Manmohan Singh walked out
 isi tarah kii tippanee pradhanmantri ne jadyu saansad sharad yadav or sipiem saansad seetaram yechuri ke bare main bhi kii
 When Sharad Yadav wanted to speak in between, instead of addressing the bench, the Prime Minister said directly to him that you sit down now, you will say what you want to say later
 aapako to main jeevanabhar sunuunga
 Saying the same thing with Sitaram Yechury, the Prime Minister stepped down a notch
 wo bole, “baad main jawaab dena bhaiya, abhi puri zindagi padi he
 You will come from somewhere
 ”haalanki pradhanmantri ke bhaashan ke baad sattapaksh ne niyamon kii duhai dete hue donon hi sadasyon ko bolne nahin diya or sidhe voting kii maang kii
 Opposition leaders believe that due to the kind of decisions the Prime Minister has taken in the past and the kind of crisis that the party is going to see in the upcoming assembly elections, the Prime Minister is witnessing such a panic
 sansadeey maryaada or paramparaon main buudhvaar kaa din ek paaydaan or neeche girane ke taur par darj ho chukaa he
 (history) maharashtra (maharashtra) main sarkaar gathan par gatirodh jari he
 Meanwhile, Uddhav Thackeray (uddhav Thackeray) after the joint press conference of Congress and NCP said that Shiv Sena will continue to talk to Congress and NCP to form government
 idhar maharashtra main sarkaar banane kaa ek nayaa formula bhi saamne aa rahaa he
 According to the sources, the Shiv Sena and NCP will be the Chief Minister for two-and-a-half years and will be the Deputy Chief Minister of the Congress for the full 5 years
 saajha press conference ke baad shivasena pramukhuddhav thakare ne kaha ki agar bijepi or mahabuuba mufti vaicharik matbhedon ko dur karte hue saath kaam kar sakate hai to maujuuda sthiti main unki party congress or ensipi ke saath kaam karne kaa formula khoj lenge
 Uddhav Thackeray also said that BJP has sought information about the agreement with PDP and Nitish so that they can understand how different ideological parties come together
 ek sawaal ke jawaab main uddhav ne ye bhi kaha ki vikalp bijepi ne khatm kiye hai, unki party ne nahin
 Please tell that Shiv Sena President Uddhav Thackeray had said on Tuesday that the Bharatiya Janata Party BJP is still contacting it through unofficial means to form the government in Maharashtra
 thakare ne kaha, "ve har baar aspasht or alag-alag prastaav de rahe hai
 But we have decided to go with the congress-nationalist Congress Party

 He was hanged for joining the rebellion
 yah itihaaskaar chahta he ki is sainik kaa kapaal usee sthaan par dafnaaya jaae jahaan usne antim ladaai main bhaag liya tha
 Dr Kim Wagner, senior lecturer at the British Imperial History at Queen Mary College, London-based, believes that this is the right time to bury Havildar Alam Bhag (a major hero involved in the rebellion) in his country
 darasal, san 1857 main hue bharat ke pehle swatantraaa sangram main britain kii sena main shaamil ek bhartiya ne bharat kii ore se hue swatantraaa sangram main britain sipaahi alam bheg ko vidroh maanata he
 Captain AR Castello, who was on duty at the time, had taken Alam Bhag's head with him to England
 is vidroh ke aarope main bheg ko bharat main faansee di gai thi
 Also read: Mangal Pandey was hanged today, know - special things related to him Wagner, author of the recent book 'the Skull of Alam Bhag: The Life and Death of a Rebel in 1857', said that Bhag's regiment was basically : Was established in Kanpur, but i believe it would be appropriate to bury his skull along the banks of the Ravi River in the border between India and Pakistan where Alam Bhag participated in the battle of Trimmu Ghat
 unhone kaha, 'main alam bheg ke kapaal ko waapas kiye jane ko raajnneeti nahin maanata
 My focus is only that the remains of Alam Bhag be transported to his motherland so that his soul can rest in peace 160 years after his death
 'gauratlab he ki itihaaskaar ne bharat or britain ke rajanyikon ke bich ek bahes ched di he
 Lecturer Dr
 Kim Wagner's research and writing on the 1857 rebellion surrounding the tragic end of Alam Baig began in 2014 when he was approached by Baig's family who had come to pick up the skull
 aapako bataa den ki saal 1963 main alam bheg kaa kapaal kent ke valmer nagar sthit ek pub main mila tha
 The new owner of the Lord Clyde pub found the skull in a small store room
 is kapaal ke bare main likhaa tha ki yah east india company kii seva main shaamil ek bhartiya sainik kaa he jo scotland kii mishanri ke puure parivaar kii hatya kaa aaropee tha

 Former Finance Minister p Chidambaram said that country employment is the biggest problem today

 p Chidambaram said that to generate employment we have to create jobs, create different jobs for phd, IIT Graduate or just BA pass course
 hamen 50 fisadi un student ke liye bhi job chahie jo aathvin ke baad padhai chhod dete hai
 Chidambaram was asked by financial journalist r Jagannathan that despite the high growth rate, there was no job growth even in UPA, when you were the finance minister? In response to this question, he said, 'I do not agree with this, the economic sector of the economic sector, which is 90 per cent, grew well
 esemai, emsamai, organijd sector ko growth kaa mauka mila or job criation ko badhane kaa mauka mila

 modi sarkaar ke dauraan bhi NPA badha he
 JP Morgan's Chief Economist Sajid Chinoy asked what steps India should take for the next 10-15 years when the world economy is downhill? Chidambaram said that as a strategy, exports need to be encouraged

 It will be mentioned in our manifesto

 The T20 series being played between India and New Zealand is on par with 1-1
 tisare T-20 main tay hoga ki siries kiske naam hogi
 But after India's defeat in the second T20, a new question has arisen
 wo sawaal he ki kya mahendra singh dhoni kii jagah tii-20 team main banati he yaa nahin
 Many former cricketers have raised questions on Dhoni's place in the team
 purv bhartiya khilaadi vivies lakshmana kaa maananaa he ki tii-20 main em es dhoni kii jagah nabanr 4 par banati he, kyonki unhen krij par zyada samay bitaana chahie
 But when Kohli was batting well in the second T20 match, Dhoni should have given more strikes to Kohli only
 lakshmana ne kaha kikohali kaa strike rateus samay 160 kaa tha, to dhoni kaa sirf 80 kaa
 He said that Dhoni is an important part in the ODI team but in T20 he should give opportunity to young players
 vahiin duusari ore bhartiya khilaadi harbhajan singh ne bhi kaha ki bade chez main team ko acchhee shuruyaat milanaa jaruri he, lekin duusare tii-20 main rohit or shikhar dhawan acchhee shuruyaat nahin de paae
 Significantly, in the second T20, New Zealand had given a target of 197 runs in front of India
 bharat kii shuruyaat acchhee nahin thi, 9
 India's score was four for 67 in 1 over
 us dauraan bharat ko 65 gendon main 130 ranon kii jarurat thi
 But Dhoni failed to score fast
 dhoni kii ore se lagaataar dot ball kheli ja rahi thi, or strike bhi rotate nahin ho rahi thi
 On one hand, Dhoni was failing to rotate the strike, on the other side Virat Kohli was continuously hitting long hits
 kohli kareeb 150 ke strike rate se ran bana rahe the
 But Kohli could not get the strike
 jab dhoni krij par aae to bharat ko 12 ke ran rate se ran chahie the, lekin wo badhkar baad main 19 se bhi upar chalaa gaya tha
 However, apart from former players, captain Virat Kohli defended Dhoni
 unhone kaha tha ki jab bade lakshya kaa peechha karnaa hota he to shuruyaat acchhee honi chahie, har ballebaaj ko ran banane chahie the
 Kohli said that Dhoni showed a good performance in the end but we were in a very difficult position in the end
 gauratlab he ki pichley kuch samay se mahendra singh dhoni ke khel main bada badlaav aayaa he
 Now that former Dhoni is not seen who starts hitting fours and sixes
 ab dhoni krij par aane ke baad thodaa samay lete hai or baad main tej ran bananaa shuru karte hai
 The same thing happened in the second T20, Dhoni was a bit straggling initially but later he scored big
 unhone 37 gendon main 49 ran banaae the
 It remains to be seen whether Mahendra Singh Dhoni or the team management will take any major action
 kyonki jaise-jaise dhoni kii umr bad rahi he vaise hi is tarah ke sawaal uthne lajimi hai
 The threat of threat to Delhi's Indira Gandhi International Airport turned out to be false

 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi kii iftaar party main samaajawaadee party kaa koi numaayinda nahin pahunchaa, jiske baad se sawaal uthne lage hai ki kya congress or samaajawaadee party ke bich sabakuch thik-thaak nahin chal rahaa he?kya samaajawaadee party (SP) ke rashtriya adhyaksh akhilesh yadav ko bahujan samaaj party (BSP) supremeo mayawati or congress kii kareebi raas nahin aa rahi he? sawaal yah bhi uth rahaa he ki kya purv mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav gathbandhan ke tahat siton ke bantwaare ko lekar dabaav main hai
 It is being told that the Samajwadi Party holds the Congress responsible for the crushing defeat in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections
 lihaaja samaajawaadee party aagaamee loksabhaa chunaav main congress ko zyada bhav dene ke mood main nahin hai
 At the same time, the Samajwadi Party does not want to leave the BSP in any way after the victory in the by-elections

 haalanki guuruuvaar ko kannauj se aae kaaryakartaaon ko sambodhit karte hue akhilesh ne saaf kaha ki gathbandhan hoga or jald hoga
 The phase of speculation started with the absence of Iftar party
 The speculation started due to the absence of any representative of Samajwadi Party in Rahul Gandhi's Iftar party on Wednesday
 jis tareeke se mayawati or congress lagaataar najadik aa rahe hai, wo shaayad akhilesh yadav ko raas nahin aa rahi he
 The Samajwadi Party itself saw the manner in which the body language and chemistry of the BSP and Congress leaders was seen in the swearing-in of Karnataka Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy and then the Congress had serious discussions with the BSP in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh
 Has started feeling on edge
 yahi vajah he ki samaajawaadee party ne madhya pradesh kii sabhi siton par chunaav ladane kaa elaan kiya he
 The SP party does not want an alliance with the Congress in UP, and its leaders have also openly announced this
 gorakhpur or phulpur loksabhaa up chunaavon main congress ke chunaav ladane ke baavjood samaajawaadee party ne na sirf siten jiti, balki congress kii jamaanat bhi jabt ho gai
 In such a situation, the SP no longer wants to compromise with the Congress in UP
 vahiin, duusari taraf bahujan samaaj party lagaataar congress se kareebi badhaati dikh rahi he or yahi samaajawaadee party ke liye philhal sabase bada saradard he
 The BSP did not open in the last Lok Sabha elections
 Account UP has a total of 80 parliamentary seats
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main modi lahar main bijepi gathbandhan ne 73 siton par jeet hasil kii thi
 The SP got five seats and the Congress two, while the bsp's account was also not opened
 isi tarah se pichley saal hue upi vidhansabha chunaav main sapa ne basapa se zyada siten jeetne main kaamyaab rahi thi
 Although both parties contested in these elections separately
 iske baad phulpur-gorakhpur upachunaav main sapa ko basapa ne samarthan diya tha
 As a result, the BJP suffered a crushing defeat
 iske baad se donon partiyaan ke bich rishte majboot hue hai
 This is the reason why Akhilesh Yadav is not ready to leave the BSP in any way
 mayawati lagaataar banaae hue hai dabaavakairana upachunaav ke pehle mayawati ne sammanjanak siton ke nahin milane par gathbandhan nahin karne kaa elaan kiya tha or phir jis tareeke se akhilesh yadav ne uttar pradesh main junior partner banane par apni sahmati jataai thi, uske baad se lagane laga tha ki bispi se gathbandhan ko lekar akhilesh yadav kaaphi aatur hai, lekin mayawati philhal apane sadhe chaalon se akhilesh ko lagaataar dabaav main rakh rahi hai
 Declaration of lesser seats did not embrace SP activists There is a lot of buzz in the political corridors of Uttar Pradesh that all is not well between the SP and BSP alliance
 mayawati 40 se 44 siton se kam par chunaav nahin ladanaa chaahati hai, jabaki akhilesh yadav baraabar yaa 2-4 kam siton par raji ho sakate hai, lekin samasya sirf seat tak hi nahin he
 Mayawati can also go with the Congress
 At the same time, the Congress is currently looking at its future with Mayawati in Uttar Pradesh with strict tricks
 aise main samaajawaadee party kii sabase badi chintaa yah he ki mayawati kahin zyada siton ke naam par congress ke saath na chali jaaen
 Sensing the same, Akhilesh Yadav had given his consent to become a junior partner in Mainpuri four days ago
 ek taraf bangala vivaad main akhilesh yadav kii saaf-suthri image ko dhakka laga he, to duusari ore mayawati or congress kii nazdikiyaan bhi akhilesh yadav ke liye acchhee khabar nahin he
 This is the reason why even after opening all its cards first, political pressure is clearly visible on Akhilesh Yadav

 (hedline ke alaava, is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he, yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he

 BSP-SP has denied any alliance with Congress in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan Vidhan Sabha elections
 vahiin, congress bhi ek sochi samajhi ranneeti ke tahat in donon dalon ke aage jhukne bajaay apane bhavishya kii siyasat ko dekh rahi he
 This is the reason that in all the three states, the Congress has come out to compete with the BJP in the political battlefield without any alliance
 darasal, in teenon rajyon main bijepi or congress ke bich sidhaa muqabla he
 Currently, BJP has governments in all three states and Congress is the main opposition party
 jabaki basapa kaa kuch had tak aadhaar he, lekin sapa kaa koi khaas vajood nahin he
 In such a situation, the Congress does not want to give these parties a chance to establish roots by tying up with them
 isiilie congress gathbandhan ko lekar inke saamne jhukne ko taiyaar nahin he
 However, the Congress wanted it to form an alliance with the BSP in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh
 donon partiyon ke netaaon ke bich baatcheet bhi chal rahi thi
 Mayawati had demanded so many seats in both states, on which the Congress could not agree
 sutron kii maane to congress ne madhya pradesh main basapa ko 10 or sapa ko teen siten dene kii peshkash kii thi
 Apart from this, the Congress wanted to give 3 seats to the BSP in Chhattisgarh, while Mayawati was seeking 10 seats
 congress dwaara sapa-basapa ko kam tavajjo dene ke peeche ek badi vajah ye maani ja rahi he ki pichley teen vidhansabha chunaav in donon partiyon madhya pradesh main bahut zyada prabhaav nahin dikhaa saki hai
 bsp's base is steadily decreasing
 basapa kabhi madhya pradesh main 11 vidhayak hua karte the or 2 saansad
 At present, the BSP has been reduced to just legislators
 madhya pradesh main 2013 ke vidhansabha chunaav main basapa ne 227 siton par ummidavaar utaare the
 Of these, his bail was forfeited in 194 seats
 basapa 6
 With 42 per cent of the votes, it could win only four seats
 vahiin, sapa ne 164 ummidavaar utaare the, jinamein se 161 siton par uski jamaanat jabt ho gai thi
 Just 0 to SP
 51 fisadi vot mila tha
 While 36 to Congress
 38 fisadi vot mili the
 In Rajasthan too, the BSP has steadily weakened
 2013 ke vidhansabha chunaav main 3
 The BSP was able to win 3 seats with 4% votes
 jabaki 2008 main basapa ne 6 siten jeetne ke saath 7
 It had secured 6 percent votes
 sapa ko 1
 40 percent of the votes were received in 2013
 congress ko 33
 1% percent of the votes were received
 chhattisgarh main basapa kaa vot share or siten ghati hai
 BSP 4 in 2013 assembly election
 5 fisadi vot ke saath 1 seat jeet saki thi
 Whereas before that he had two mlas
 vahiin sapa ko 0
 64 percent votes were received
 darasal, congress is baat ko maanakar chal rahi he ki teen rajyon main bijepi ke khilaaf sattavirohi lahar he
 In such a situation, it will get direct benefit instead of SP-BSP
 isi ke maddenjar congress sahyogi dalon ke saamne jhukne ko taiyaar nahin he
 Instead, the Congress is working on a strategy to integrate Dalit, OBC and tribal leaders with itself
 congress ranneetikaar is baat ko bhi maanakar chal rahe hai ki vidhansabha chunaav main agar sapa-basapa ko zyada siten di gai to loksabhaa chunaav wo badi demand rakhenge
 Apart from this, if the Congress wins the political battle of the three states, then there will be an atmosphere in its favor in the country
 iske baad vipakshi dalon ke bich apni sharton par samjhauta karegi or sahyogi dalon ko uski baat tavajjo dena majaburi ban jayega
 However, the Congress is hopeful that the Grand Alliance will stand before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections next year and both major parties of UP will be part of it
 congress ke varisht netaa em virappa moili ne mangalvaar ko kaha ki rajya ke chunaavon main partiyon kii apana baadhyaatayen hoti hai
 Our main desire is to see the opposition united in the Lok Sabha elections and we hope to achieve this goal
 bharosa he ki sapa or basapa is mahagathbandhan kaa hissaa hongi

 kendriya mantri hardip singh puri ne beete dinon jharkhand sahit desh ke chah rajyon ko khule main shouch mukt ghoshit (ODF) kiya tha
 According to Hardeep Singh Puri, these states have achieved the 100 percent target of ODF in urban areas within just three years, but whether this claim is actually the ground truth or whether it shows the achievement of the target merely by juggling the data
 is baat kii sachai kii jaanch jharkhand ke kuch bade shaharon se karte hai joshauch mukt ghoshit(odf) ghoshit kiye gaye hai
 According to the claims of incomplete construction in Ranchi itself, toilets have been constructed in every house in the city, but as a sign, the Naikatoli locality of ward number 53 of Jharkhand capital Ranchi is also very bad and its distance from Jharkhand assembly from here It is just 5 kilometers and its distance from the state secretariat where big bureaucrats sit
 lekin yahaan kii haalat behad kharaab he
 Now, assuming the claims of the government, everyone has a toilet in their home
 koi bhi vyakti khule main shouch nahin karata, lekin is daawey kii hakeekat yahaan aane par milti he
 Local people say that the construction of toilets started in our area, but the construction of toilets was handed over to the contractors
 jo aadha-adhuraa kaam kar shahar se nikal gaye
 Due to which more than half of the toilets are incomplete
 aise main yahaan ke adhikansh log khule main shouch ke liye majaboor hai
 The claim of making Jharkhand ODF by 2 October is the same for other cities in Jharkhand
 khule main shouch mukt ghoshit kiye jane valajharkhandaka pehla jila ramgarh
 It was declared ODF district on April 3 last year by the government
 tab daawa kiya gaya tha ki 2016-17 ke dauraan 77,701 shauchalayon kaa nirmaan kar lakshya praapt kar liya gaya he, lekin aaj sirf 50 fisadi shauchalayon kaa hi istemaal ho paa rahaa he
 Other toilets are closed due to water shortage
 har shauchalay ke nirmaan ke liye sarkaar kii taraf se 12 hajaar kii anudaan raashi di jaati he, lekin logon kaa aarope he ki isamen adhiktar thekedaaron ne apni jeben garm kin, lekin yahaan bhi pani kii kami or aadhe-adhure nirmaan kii vajah se ye band pade hai
 On the other hand, the state Chief Minister Raghuvar Das said that now the BJP has won the civic elections in urban areas after the BJP governments at the Center and the state, now the development work will pick up pace
 vaise mukhyamantri kaa daawa yah bhi he ki 2 oktober 2018 tak puure rajya ko ODF bana diya jayega

 Highly placed sources in the government say that the government believes that all the cases that have been registered against Lalit Modi during the upa's Manmohan Singh government are under FEMA and no one should be arrested under this law

 sutara yah bhi bataa rahe hai ki lalit modi ke khilaaf ab tak ke sabase gambhir aarope bisisiai kii us samiti kii ore se lagaae gaye hai jisaki adhyakshata arun jetali ne kii thi
 Sources say that now on the basis of these allegations, the government will file a case against Lalit Modi under the new sections so that it can be tightened
 isi kadi main mana ja rahaa he ki sarkaar ab lalit modi par mani londring kaa cese darj karegi taaki court se uske khilaaf giraftaar kaa aadesh liya ja sake or phir antarrashtriya kanoonon ke hisaab se lalit modi ko bharat laayaa ja sake or kanoonee prakriya ko aage badhaayaa ja sake
 Sources are telling that in order to remove these shortcomings of the previous government, the Narendra Modi government is also planning to make new changes in the law so that such cases can be dealt with strictly in future

 This law only gives the right to recover money
 yahi vajah he ki sarkaar kii ore se abhi bhi aadhikarik rup se lalit modi ko 'bhagoda' ghoshit nahin kiya ja sakaa he
 This situation has been going on since the tenure of the UPA government
 bataa den ki vipakshi dal congress ne sarkaar par yahi aarope lagaae hai ki unki ek mantri or ek rajya kii mukhyamantri ek 'bhagode' kii madad ke aarope main sanlipt hai or isliye unhen apane apane padon se istipha de dena chahie
 Sources are also stating that the most serious allegations against Lalit Modi till date have been made by the BCCI committee headed by Arun Jaitley
 sutron kaa kahana he ki ab sarkaar inhen aaropon ko aadhaar banaakar lalit modi par nai dhaaraon ke tahat cese darj karegi taaki us par shikanja ksaa ja sake
 It is believed in this episode that the government will now file a case of money laundering on Lalit Modi so that an arrest order can be taken against him from the court and then according to international laws, Lalit Modi can be brought to India and the legal process can be taken forward Can go sutara bataa rahe hai ki purvavarti sarkaar kii inhen khaamiyon ko dur karne ke liye narendra modi sarkaar kanoon main bhi nae badlaav karne kaa man bana rahi he taaki bhavishya main aise maamalon ko sakhti se nibata ja sakate

 Now it is necessary to understand here what was the Ranbir Penal Code? What was the Ranbir Penal Code? The Ranbir Penal Code was in force in the state of Jammu and Kashmir in India
 jise ranbir aachaar samhita bhi kaha jaataa tha
 According to Article 370 of the Indian Constitution, the Indian Penal Code could not be used in the state of Jammu and Kashmir
 yahaan keval ranbir dand samhita kaa prayog hota tha
 The Ranbir Penal Code was in force in this state since British times
 darasal, bharat ke aaazaad hone se pehle jammu kashmir ek swatantra riyasat thi
 At that time, the Dogra dynasty ruled Jammu and Kashmir

 Under Section 153 CAA of the IPC, it is considered a punishable offense to deliberately bring weapons during public meetings or gatherings, while this important subject is not mentioned in the Ranbir Penal Code
 ipisi kii dhara 195A ke tahat agar koi kisi ko juthi gavaahi yaa bayaan dene ke liye pratadit karata he, to vah sajaa kaa hakdaar mana jaataa he, jabaki ranbir dand samhita main is sambandh main koi nirdesh nahin he
 Under Section 281 of the IPC, a person who is misleading a sailor with lights, marks or wheels used in perak is entitled to punishment, whereas there is nothing like that in the Ranbir Penal Code
 bhartiya dand samhita kii dhara 304B, dahej ke kaaran hone vaali mauton se sambandhit he, lekin ranbir dand samhita main iskaa koi ullekh nahin he
 Under Section 190 of the Ranbir Penal Code, the government can punish any person who publishes or distributes invalid or seized material by the government
 is maamle main aparaadh kaa nirdhaaran karne kaa adhikaar mukhyamantri ko he
 This particular section badly affects journalism, freedom of thought, thought and expression

 This important section related to bribery is not present in the IPC
 ranbir dand samhita kii dhara 420A ke tahat sarkaar, sakasham adhikari yaa praadhikaran kisi bhi samjhaute main hone vaale chal yaa dhokhadhadi kii sazaa kaa nirdhaaran karte hai
 IPC is not such a clear grammar

 The timing of the release of the video was such that it went viral quickly and reached more and more people
 ye sab us vakt hua jab aatanki hamale se stabdh bharat kaale dhuen ke gubaar se pulavama hamale ke shahid javaanon ke shavon ko ikattha karne main laga tha
 The video of the terrorist shot during the strong wind in the valley, but the video of Dar who carried out the suicide attack was not shot in a cave, forest or any urban slum
 india today ke khaas forensik vishleshan se saamne aayaa ki daar ke video ko tej hawaaon se jujh rahi kashmir ghati main mekashift teror studio kii charadivari ke bich filmaaya gaya tha
 In this first-of-its-kind investigation for the Indian media, the fine sound of the clip was captured
 iske liye hitech tuls or sensors kaa sahaara liya gaya
 The key clues from fine audio audio waveforms that the human ear is not able to hear were processed through state-of-the-art equipment
 inase tatkaal sanket mila ki jab daar kaa ye footage record kiya gaya us vakt suicide bombar pulavama se zyada dur nahin tha
 Hitech Tools captured unique acoustic signatures that helped India Today's open-source team identify the location where Dar's video was shot
 daravaaje par dastak, baahar chal rahi tej hawa samet har tarah kii awaz jo footage ko record karte samay maujuud thi, use atyaadhunik gagetts ke jariye kaid kiya gaya
 These logically helped to reach the decision that the video of the Pulwama suicide bomber was shot in an open space
 forensik test main kam se kam dhwani se judi 21 baarikiyon ko pakadaa gaya, jinamein se har ek apane aap main khaas sanketak thi
 The instruments identified the sound from the winds to the movement of the doors

 Instead, this voice was such that the wind is running outside stopping
 audio streems ko chaanane se audio or video ke bich talmail naa hone kaa bhi pataa chalaa
 This indicates that the footage was dubbed after recording
 jaish ne kiya free edit ap kaa istemalavideo kii satahon ke neeche sthit metadata dikhaata he ki footage ko kinmaster naamak ap ke free varshan ke jariye edit kiya gaya
 Jaish's tech team filming the footage deliberately did not use the premium variant of the app to avoid its prints on the transaction trail

 India Today's state-of-the-art investigation established that jaish-e-mohammed had deployed a team of technology experts to help him film Dar's terror video
 forensik vishleshan se saamne aayaa ki footage ko thos sataha par cell-phone ke jariye filmaaya gaya
 Someone else was handling the device that was shot
 dusron ke nirdesh ko maan rahaa tha pulavama aatankiindia today ke forensik nirikshan se ye bhi pataa chalaa ki daar ne apana sandesh pehle se taiyaar script se padhaa jo uske saamne ankhon tak kii oonchai par mobile camere se paanch feet kii duuri par rakhi gai thi
 Certified behavior analyst and psychologist Dr Kapil Kakkar confirmed the findings of the India Today investigation based on the terrorist's body language and manner of speaking in the clip
 dow kakkar kehete hai ki jab wo apana bayaan dena shuru karata he to aisa lagata he ki wo kahin or se use pard rahaa he
 Dr
 Kakkar explains, "there are cameras and some people standing right and left of Dar behind the camera
 wo unki sahmati le rahaa he
 His eyes keep on going here and there
 ”awaz or haavbhaav main talmail nahiindia today ke forensik exparts ne aatanki ke haavbhaavon ko bhi baariki se pakadaa
 The investigation revealed that there was no harm in the terrorist's gestures and his voice
 10 minute ke jehadi tepe main aatanki ke chehre par koi bhav nahin dikhte
 When the terrorist talks about the alleged aftermath of his life, his face remains expressionless
 dow kakkar kehete he ki suicide bombar kii body language se saaf he ki wo apane handlers ke nirdeshon par chal rahaa tha
 Dr
 Kakkar says, "look at the movements of his hands
 uske chehre ke bhaavon ko dekho
 There is no harmony between them
 agar uski puri body language ko dekhen, awaz ke pravaah, utaar chadhaav, manobhaav kaa str, sab kuch dikhaata he ki wo dusron ke nirdeshon kaa paalan kar rahaa tha

 ) anuchhed 370 ke prabhavi rup se khatm hone kii sanvaidhanik chunautiyon ke baad, ab hamaari adaalaton kaa dhyaan un bandi pratyakshikaran yachikaaon par he jinamein jammu or kashmir main najarbandi ke maamalon ko chunauti di gai he
 The latest plea of rajya Sabha MP and MDMK leader Vaiko, filed in the Supreme Court, sought to present Farooq Abdullah, a former Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir who has reached the eighth decade of age
 nivarak nirodh kanoon bharat main sanvaidhanik loktantr kii sthapana ke baad se kanoon kii kitabon main maujuud hai
 It allows detention of people who could threaten public law and order or state security or commit a crime
 sattarudh dalon kii ore se rajnatik virodhiyon ke khilaaf un kanoonon ke durupyog kaa bhi itihaas he
 The Jaquamu and Kashmir Public Safety Act (JKPSA), the state's own preventive detention law, has been used repeatedly since it came into force in 1978
 rajya kii pramukh siyaasi hastiyon kii haalia girakratari ke liye yah sabase pasandida saadhan rahaa he
 JKPSA was enforced against bureaucrat-turned-politician Shah Faisal on August 14, nine days after Article 370 became 'weak'
 vico kii bandi pratyakshikaran yachika ke baad 'saarvajanik vyavastha ke liye khatra' bataate hue faruk abdulla ko najarband kar diya gaya
 These two cases are the latest examples of how stringent preventive detention provisions such as the JKPSA or the National Security Act (NSA) can be used to suppress the voices of the ruling establishment critics — sometimes even years of detention
 
 yah kanoonee praavdhaanon se sambhav hua he jo hiraasat main lene ke baad bandiyon ko giraftaar kii vajahon kii tatkaal jaankaree dene, kanoonee madad or jamaanat jaise buniyadi adhikaar, jo 'girakrataar' logon ke paas hote hai par 'najarband' logon ke paas nahin, se vanchit karne ke alaava band daravaajon ke peeche sunwaayee jaise atiranjit adhikaar satta pratishthanon ko detaa he
 For example, under the NSA and JKPSA, the government can detain someone for 10 days without assigning any reason
 uske baad bhi, sarkaar ko lage ki yah prakatikaran saarvajanik hit ke khilaaf he, to najarbandiadesh ko prabhavi dhang se chunauti dena mushkil he
 An advisory board headed by retired judges reviews all restraining orders
 board isaki pushti yaa nirast karne kaa nirnay le saktaa he or isamen 12 saptaah lag sakate hai
 But the board routinely confirms these detention orders, rather than being a competent watchdog, as has been the experience of JKPSA
 artiai adhinium ke tahat praapt jaankaree ke anusaar, april, 2016 or disambar 2017 ke bich jammu-kashmir salaahkaar board ne 99 fisad se adhik nirodh adeshon kii pushti kar di
 But 81 percent of these confirmations were later quashed by the Jammu and Kashmir High Court
 yah jecapiese ke durupyog kii ore ishaara karata he, kyonki adhiktar nirodh adeshon ko ucch nyaayalay ne avaidh paaya
 Preventive detention provisions under the NSA have been used for political reasons
 uttar pradesh main dalit adhikaar kaaryakarta chandrashekhar aaazaad or manipur main patrkaar kishorchandra wangmecha ke haalia maamle iske udhaaharan hai
 Both have been vocal critics of the state government
 donon maamalon main, unhen anya aapraadhik maamalon main jamaanat milane ke turant baad nirodh aadesh die gaye taaki unki hiraasat avadhi badhaai ja sake
 For example, in Azad's case, 'arrest' was changed to 'preventive detention', which had political reasons
 supreme court ne bhi unhen sanvaidhanik rup se barkaraar rakhaa he, par nivarak nirodh kanoonon ke tahat rajya ko di gai apaar shaktiyaan is khatre ko badhaati hai ki in kanoonon ke jariye nagarikon kii swatantraaa kaa hanan kiya, rajnatik tathaa vaicharik virodhiyon ko nishaanaa banaaya ja saktaa he
 In the case of Maneka Gandhi (1978), Justice Krishna Iyer made a big comment, "if the law is not removed the legal illegality becomes the rule
" '' nivarak nirodh kanoonon kaa har durupyog unke vivechanaatmak pun: pareekshan kaa or bhi majboot aadhaar banaata he

 After failing to win a single match in the T20 series, captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni will be under pressure to perform better and lead the Indian team in the five-match ODI series against South Africa starting on Sunday
 samay aa gaya he ki dhoni apane aalochakon ko jawaab den kyonki unki captaini or khel ko lekar adhik sawaal uthne lage hai jabaki unke uttaradhikari or test captain viraat kohli kii prabhavi captaini se bhi un par dabaav bad gaya he
 After missing the one-day series against Bangladesh in June, Dhoni stayed away from competitive cricket for three months and returning to the ground, his team lost the three-match ODI series against South Africa 0–2
 bharat kii team santulit najar aa rahi he, lekin tii20 main jeet ke baad dakshin africa kii team aatmavishvaas se bhari he or use haraana aasaan nahin hoga
 The South African team could not have expected a better start to the tour of three T20s, five odis and four Tests ending in December
 bhartiya team main kuch badlaav dekhne ko mil sakate hai, lekin kul milakar adhikansh vahi khilaadi antim ekadash main shaamil rahenge jo tii20 maichon main khele the
 The return of Umesh Yadav will strengthen the pace attack while batting all-rounder Gurkeerat Singh Mann is eyeing his ODI debut

 The time has come for Dhoni to reply to his critics as more questions are being raised about his captaincy and the game, while the effective captaincy of his successor and Test captain Virat Kohli has also put pressure on him
 june main bangladesh ke khilaaf vanade siries ganvaane ke baad dhoni teen maheene tak pratispardhi cricket se dur rahe or maidan par vaapasi karte hue unki team ne dakshin africa ke khilaaf teen maichon kii ekadivasiy siries 0-2 se ganvaa di
 India's team looks balanced, but after winning the T20, South Africa are full of confidence and it will not be easy to defeat them
 dakshin africa kii team disambar main samaapt hone vaale teen tii20, paanch vanade or chaar test ke daure kii isse behatar shuruuaat kii ummid nahin kar sakati thi
 There may be some changes in the Indian team, but overall most of the players who played in T20 matches will remain in the playing XI

 ghar kaa rashan sirf do din main khatm hone par sabhi gharavaale shahanaz or paras kaa target karte hai, kyonki rashan ko manage karne kii jimmedaari shahanaz or paras kii he
 The Paras give the idea of saving the household rations in their cleaning
 lekin shahanaz kahati hai ki wo rashan kii jimmedaari nahin uthaa sakati hai, unhen ye sab samaj hi nahin aata he

 ’’ ayodhya main sapa kii jeet kaa bada pratikatmak mahatv he
 VHP is busy in preparing the bjp's land
 jaraa peeche jaaen to uttar pradesh ke bijepi prabharee banaae gaye narendra modi ke khasmkhas amit shah ne do maah pehle ayodhya kaa daura kiya
 Shah slowly left Surasuri that the Ram temple should be built
 iske baad ve waapas apane chunavi kaam main lag gaye
 And left the rest of the work to the VHP
 udhar, amit shah se aage nikle unke raajnneetik guru narendra modi
 On one hand, Ashok Singhal feels that the power of Lord Ram has entered inside Narendra Modi to build the Ram temple, on the other hand, Modi is silent on this issue as if Mahadev has established a tomb
 modi khud vikaas kii baton par jor de rahe hai or apni sampradayik palki dhone kaa kaam unhone parivaar ke viechpi jaise sadasyon par chhod diya he
 Modi, who has been cashing in on the minor possibilities too closely, knows that the communal issue of Uttar Pradesh is the double-edged sword
 jo bijepi masjid girane se pehle uttar pradesh main purna bahumat sarkaar chalaati thi, masjid girane ke baad uski kismat main vipaksh main baithne yaa jod-tod kii sarkaar chalaane ke alaava kuch nahin mila
 In such a situation, even if the movement of 84 Kos Parikrama gets frustrated, then the bjp's savior Modi will not have to face at least a disgrace
 isiilie viechpi kaaryakarta 25 agast se 13 sitambar tak yatra jari rakhane par amada hai
 He has made at least 250 teams of saints to join the parikrama everyday and has gone underground to avoid arrest
 viechpi ke ek netaa ne bataaya, ‘‘agar ek team giraftaar ho jaaegi to duusari team parikrama jari rakhegi
 The government will not stop us
 ’’ unhone panfalet baante hai jiske mutabik, kanpur or jaipur ke sant 25 agast ko subah ayodhya main sarayu nadi se apni parikrama shuru karenge or shaam tak basti jile main pahunch jaaenge
 Then this journey will continue in the districts of Sant Kabir Nagar, Basti, Bahraich and Shravasti including Faizabad
 in saare jilon main acchhee-khaasi muslim aabaadi he
 In such a situation, the administration can clearly see the possibility of increasing tension
 logon kaa josh thanda bana rahe, isliye ayodhya shahar main suraksha balon kaa flag march bhi shuru kar diya gaya he
 Ayodhya residents who are in a dilemma, what should the Ayodhya residents who live in Ramdhun do in such condition? At the time when the mosque fell, at about the same time the winds of liberalization started in the country
 baaki desh main tarakkee hui, lekin ayodhya ko mila sthaayee tanaav
 No roads were improved, no new employment opportunities
 tabhi to yah shahar bharat main garibi kii chalati-phirti tasviir ban gaya he
 Outside the Kanak Bhawan temple, the main center of Ayodhya's faith, when VHP head face Mahant Brijmohan Das asked why the condition of the city was so bad? Why are people cooking on the platforms of temples? Thousands of pilgrims doing treacherous along the roads? Why are people sleeping in the open? Where did the hospice go? Why don't you guys do anything for this city? This is Ram Rajya? Listen to Das's mouth as part of vhp's movement: No government has shown interest in the development of Ayodhya
 iske vikaas ko mudda banaaya janaa jaruri he
 "even though the VHP leaders may get the heads of the governments blown off, but Haji Asad Ahmad, the municipal councilor of the Ram Janmabhoomi area, is scared

 "when a guest comes, the police has to report

 "another local resident Gajraj Tiwari says about Assad," i remember very well, how did this person save lives by playing life when there was a ruckus
 ’’kuch aisi hi udhedbun se janmabhumi-babari masjid malikana haq maamle ke ek pakshakaar haji mehboob ahamed bhi guzar rahe hai
 Mehboob, once living in the big landlords of Ayodhya, does not forget that the house where he is sitting today was badly burnt in the riots
 jindagi kaa bada hissaa mukadmaa ladgaye main guzaar chuke haji kehete hai, ‘‘vah tabaahi baahar waalon ne kii thi
 The people of Ayodhya never beat me up
 ’’ unhen yakeen he ki ab baahar vaale ayodhya ko uksaa nahin sakate, lekin unke chehre par baar-baar ubharta bhay mishrit gussa is yakeen se mail nahin khaataa
 The condition of temples and mosques here does not match the national picture of temple-mosque Ayodhya, which was visited by politics
 mandiron kii khasta haalat ko falahari baba kuch aise samajhate hai, ‘‘mahant or pujari in mandiron ko nijee milkiyat samajhate hai
 If they think first, then they will have time to worry about God
 ’’ shahar ke bahut-se mandir agar mahanton kii nijee sampatti hai to bahut-se mandir isliye benur hote ja rahe hai ki unka kharchaa uthaane vaale raaje-rajavaade or jameendaar vakt kii aandhi main kab ke ud chuke hai
 The government could not reach them
 aisi bahut-si jameen adalati vivaadon main uljhi he, jo kabhi puja-paath kaa kharch uthaane ke liye mandiron ko di gai thi
 "at least 11 mahants have been accused of killing their gurus
 ’’ayodhya ke itihaas se lekar raajnneeti tak saare pahaluon par kalam chalaa chuke bujurg patrkaar sheetala singh ek line main hi pate kii baat kah jate hai
 It is clear from him that the religious management of Ayodhya has gone awry and the Mahant, administration and leaders caught in the temple-mosque dispute have neither the courage nor the intention to find a solution
 kabhi yahaan bhi dakshin bharat ke mandiron kii tarah ek devsthanam trust banane kii baat chali thi, lekin vah na to sire chadhwai thi, na chadhi
 Any pilgrim coming to Ayodhya does not take any time to understand that this city has been left behind from other Hindu pilgrimage sites like Kashi, Haridwar or Prayag
 babari masjid girane ke baad se kisi masjid main bhi ek nai eent lagaana muhaal ho gaya he
 The mosque that is currently sparking controversy is the Dorahi Mosque near the Kubera mound, some distance away from the disputed site
 sthaneey nivaasiyon ke mutabik, yah masjid 1992 ke updrav ke samay kshatigrast hui thi
 Since then, Muslim society has been demanding to build it, but the administration is not allowing it to be constructed for some reason or the other
 udhar hindu sanghathan daawa kar rahe hai ki muslim samaaj jaan-boojhkar khandhar ko masjid sabit karne par laga he
 "to suppress such disputes, the administration often argues that Ayodhya is prohibited from functioning in mosques," says local social activist Shah Alam
 ’’ haalanki jab unhone artiai ke madhyam se rajya sarkaar se jaankaree maangi to aisi kisi roak se inkaar kiya gaya
 But the ground reality is that the religious plight in the religious city is being attained
 ayodhya main grihasth parampara ke sabase bade mahant or congress ke kaaryakari jiladhyaksh girishpati treepathi ek vaakya main dharmanagari kii vidambnaa ko pesh kar dete hai, ‘‘jitna paisa ayodhya ke vivaadit sthal kii suraksha main kharch ho rahaa he, uskaa aadha bhi dharmasthalon ke rakrakhaav par kharch hota to phija kuch or hoti
 '' And finally Kirtanlekin but away from these irony is the Mani Parbat

 Now, with Ayodhya Dharma Bhoomi, there is also tension land, so half of the PAC camp is used

 In one place, many villagers are sitting in the circle and in the middle there is a dance steeped in devotion

 On the tune of ikatare and the beat of dholak-majira, the glory of Ram Chandra's jiyya is being announced
 nartak bahut kushal nahin hai or na hi darshak bahut rasik, phir bhi vahaan maujuud har aadmi bhakthiras main gote laga rahaa he
 But taking a look, the PAC trucks are standing around this whole place where Majma is going on
 ayodhya jab bhi khush hoti he, uske saath-saath sangeenon kaa manahuus saaya jarur chalata rahata he
 The stubbornness of the 84 Kosi Parikrama is to take Ayodhya once again at the cusp of controversy
 falahari baba ko jo mudda murda dikhaai detaa he, hindu sanghathan us murde ke munh main sanjivani daalane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 Wasim Barelvi probably wrote for such an occasion, the temple is silent, the mosque is silent, hate is speaking; And politics, weighing where the poison has reached
 aise halaat main ayodhya sirf yah prarthana hi kar sakati he ki use ek baar phir siyaasi mohara na banaaya jaae

 The Shivraj government was also warned to expose the Narmada Yatra and plantation fraud
 isi ke tahat 'narmada ghotaalaa rath yatra' 1 april se 45 divasiy yatra par nilakane vaale the
 He was about to start the journey from Indore, through which he would go to the districts, towns and villages of the Narmada shore and open the Shivraj government
 'narmada ghotaalaa rath yatra' 1 april se 15 may tak pradesh ke alag-alag jilon se guzarani thi
 Before the computer Baba set out on the Narmada Yatra, the Shivraj government set up a committee in a hurry

 Computer had tried to please Baba by giving him the status of Minister of State
 rajyamantri kaa darja hasil karne ke baad computer baba ne kaha tha, 'ham logon ne yah yatra nirast kar di he, kyonki pradesh sarkaar ne narmada nadi ke sangrakshan ke liye sadhu-santon kii samiti banane kii hamaari maang puri kar di he

 Computer Baba said, 'I wanted to work in the interests of cow protection, Narmada conservation, monasteries, but failed to do so

 Taking a dig at the state government, he said, "he (shivraj Singh Chauhan) has done all the foul play"

 congress alaakaman ne maharashtra ke mukhyamantri prithviraj chavaan se kaha he ki vah ajit pavaar kaa istipha manjuur kar len
 Sources say that for the post of Deputy Chief Minister, Congress says that it is for the NCP to decide

 The meeting will be chaired by Maharashtra Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan
 congress ke sabhi vidhayakon ko baithak main aane ke liye kaha gaya he
 It is believed that the relationship between Congress and NCP will also be discussed in the situation arising after the resignation of Ajit Pawar in the meeting
 vaise, maharashtra main ensipi kii raajnneeti ko lekar kai tarah ke kayaas lagaae ja rahe hai
 At least four theories are working on Ajit Pawar's resignation
 theory number −1 Ajit Pawar feels that the Congress Chief Minister is behind the leaking of corruption news against him
 pavaar rajya main nayaa mukhyamantri chaahate hai
 Theory number −2 ajit pavaar or sharad pavaar ke bich andruni sangharsh he isliye ajit pavaar ne ye raajnneetik stant kiya he
 The comments theory number −3 All the work is done by Sharad Pawar, he wants to cut against Ajit Pawar on one side and put pressure on Congress on the other side
 theory number −4 On cooperative banks and other issues, Congress is making it difficult for NCP, so this decision was taken

 akhilesh ne kaha ki bhaajapa ke pehle ke aayojanon se na to nae nivesh aae hai or na hi koi industry lagi he
 Under the government's integrated township, the developers who have planned their project plans are facing complaints of not approving the DPR for months
 akhilesh ne kaha ki ek saal ke andar nivesh protsaahan ke naam par teesraa aayojan 28 july 2019 ko hone ja rahaa he, lekin sarkaar ne ab tak saaf taur par ye nahin bataaya he ki pichley 2 aayojanon ke tahat pradesh main kitna poojinivesh hua he or kitni industry lagi hai
 Akhilesh said that the BJP government has failed to bring in new investors
 purv siem ne kaha ki baar-baar sarkaar unheen niveshkon kaa naam le rahi he jo samaajawaadee sarkaar ke kaarykaal main puunji nivesh ke liye aae the
 The credit of bringing HCL, Medanta Group, Amul Plant, IT Hub and others to the state goes to the Samajwadi Government
 unhone kaha ki afasarshahi ke chalate niveshak niraash hai or apane ko apamaanit mahasoos kar rahe hai
 Akhilesh said that the Chief Minister of the state shows the dream of a one trillion dollar economy to the state, but the situation is that neither the law and order situation in the state nor the favorable infrastructure facilities are available for the industry
 unhone kaha ki koi din aisa nahin jaataa jab pradesh main hatya, lut, apharan or balaatkaar kii ghatnaayen na ghatati hon
 Akhilesh said that the 14-kilometer road, constructed 4 months ago in the Defense Minister's Dream Project Lucknow Outer Ring, collapsed at 18 places

 agar samaajawaadee sarkaar ke ruke hue kaam hi bhaajapa sarkaar puraa kar le to kuch to vikaas dikhaai padane lagegaa

 Nitish Kumar was speaking at a press conference after launching a membership campaign at the Janata Dal United office in Patna 
 jab prashanth kishor ke mudde par unase sawaal poocha gaya to unhone kaha ki ravivaar ko rashtriya kaaryakaarani kii baithak main bhaag lene prashanth kishor aaenge or wo is bare bataaenge
 However, he admitted that whatever party's work is his responsibility, the party has not had any trouble till now
 nitish kumaar ne mana ki raajnneetik ranneetikaar ke rup main prashanth kishor kii apni pahchaan he or sab logon se unke sambandh hai
 However, Janata Dal United (JDU) has nothing to do with the work done by their company for other parties
 nitish kumaar ne mana ki jab se trinmul congress kaa kaam sanbhaalane kii baat ai he tab se media main kai saare sawaal uthaae ja rahe hai
 Confusion has also taken place in the media on this issue
 haalanki unka kahana he ki jab andhrapradesh main vah YSR congress kaa kaam sambhaal rahe the, jisamen unhen baari safalataa mili he tab is bare main kisi ne koi charchaa nahin kii, lekin logon kaa abhi achaanak is sambandh main dhyaan padaa he
 Nitish's gesture was definitely that both the Trinamool Congress and the BJP are face to face in Bengal
 bihar main vah BJP ke sahyog se sarkaar chalaa rahe hai, isliye log is mudde par zyaada sawaal kar rahe hai
 After this, Nitish Kumar said that we cannot say anything, because Prashant Kishore himself will express himself about what he thinks
 lekin party kaa in sab chizon se koi rishta nahin he or ye meri jaankaree main nahin he
 Let us tell you that Prashant Kishore, who was the chief electoral strategist of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the 2014 general election, again made a strong comeback in his business, playing a key role in the 'tsunami victory' of YSR Congress led by Jagmohan Reddy in Andhra Pradesh

 Prashant Kishore had prepared a strategy for the Congress in the elections held in Uttar Pradesh in the year 2017, but the Congress had to suffer badly in this election
 bataa den ki bihar kii sattadhari party jediu ke upaadhyaksh prashanth kishor ko nitish kumaar ne is chunaav bamushkil hi koi badi jimmedaari saunpi
 The reason behind this was that Nitish Kumar was under pressure from the allied party BJP
 bijepi yuvaaon ke bich jediu ke vistaar kii prashanth kishor kii yojana ko lekar naaraaz thi
 On this, Nitish Kumar increasingly understood the bjp's discomfort and instead of ignoring his concern, decided to shore up his vice president Prashant Kishore

 Apart from this, it has also been found in the study that women are better than men in claiming housing rent allowance and taking deduction under health expenses
 report main kaha gaya he ki pramukh metro shaharon main chennai or dilli ensiaar kaa ausat kar anupaat sabase kam 5 pratishat he
 It is 6 percent in Mumbai and Hyderabad and 7 percent in Bangalore

 report main kaha gaya he ki aise log jinaki aamadani 5 lakh rupee salanaa se kam he, unamem sirf 6
