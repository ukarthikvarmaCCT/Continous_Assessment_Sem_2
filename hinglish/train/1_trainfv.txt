 tharur ne aage likhaa he- maine ab mahasoos kar liya ki mujhe aisa nahin maananaa chahie tha ki log majaak pasand karenge
 We should not give opportunity to those who break your words of their own volition

 Sources said that during the nomination of 22 out of the 25 candidates, Gehlot was with him and visited every field at least 3 times
 isamen yah bhi kaha gaya ki gahalot ne sirf jodhpur par dhyaan diya yah aarope sahi nahin he
 Today, Gehlot was in Rahul Gandhi's house for 45 minutes
 unase pehle sachin payalat jo ki rajasthan kii dipti siem hai congress adhyaksh se mili the
 Let me tell you that the Congress had won the Assembly elections under Sachin's leadership, but at the time of making CM, he had fallen behind Gehlot
 bataa den ki ashok gahalot ke bete vaibhav gahalot jodhpur se 2 lakh se zyaada voton se chunaav haar gaye, jabaki mukhyamantri yaheen se vidhayak hai or paanch baar vidhayak rah chuke hai

 aapako bataa den ki rajasthan main congress sirf 25 lok sabha siten hi nahin haari he lekin 200 vidhansabha main 185 main peeche rahi he
 If Vaibhav is backward by 18000 from Sardarpur in Gehlot's seat, then even Sachin Pilot in Tonk could not save the Congress candidate from 22000

 Something similar has happened in Bihar
 bihar ke kuch chate hue badmaashon ne technology kaa istemaal karte hue jurm karne ke tareeke ko bhi hitech bana diya
 For this, a team of 22 criminals has been formed
 team kaa ek whatsap group banaaya gaya or iske saath hi gunaah ke khel kaa ek nayaa tarika ijad ho gaya
 User 1- What is the next plan? User 2- Bank robbing user 1- Which bank? User 2- sbiuser 1- But it will require weapons 2- They will run
 
 (also photo of weapon and pistol) User 1- Right brother, but how many weapons will definitely need 2- Don't worry
 
 Everything has been arranged

 Now the preparations for the loot were left
 ye koi pehali baar nahin tha
 When planning for loot
 plotting or ection ke liye is bhai naam ke whotsape group kaa istemaal kiya gaya ho
 Because this group was formed for the brothers
 bhai yani badmaash tip logon ke liye
 And in this group not one or two but 22 dreaded criminals were connected
 or sumit urf raja naam kaa ye badmaash is group kaa admin tha
 Admin means the person who runs such a group
 kul milakar chate hue badmaashon ne aapas main ek duusare ko apni rangabaazi dikhaane ke liye is group ko banaaya tha
 Unaware of this, this group is not only going to smuggle them but is also going to be a trouble for them
 magar chunki is group kii buniyaad hi bhaigiri ke liye thi
 So the discussions in this were also similar

 balki unki aapraadhik vaardaaton kii akhbaar main chhapi khabaron or tivi par chale videos ko share kar duusare aparaadhiyon par rob bhi jhaadte hai
 Moreover, this group was also used for bidding of weapons and bombs, gunpowder and bullets
 vaardaat kii khabar ko share kar bhai kaa jalawaa bataane vaala ek massej tha
 In which it is written, 'dekha Bhai Ki Jalwa'
 ' or akhbaar main chhapi vaardaat kii khabar or clip ko bhi dekhie
 Not only this, this whatsapp group named Bhai is also showing the weapons and their messages to the bidder and also the planning of bank robbery
 pichley kuch dinon main bihar ke vaishali zile ke ird gird hui kai darjan vaardaaton kaa sidhaa link is bhai naam ke whatsap group se judaa hua he
 Those incidents are directly related to 22 dangerous gangster members associated with this group
 inamen vaishali jile ke jandaha main 1 janvari ko jewelers ko goli markar lakhon ke jevaraat luutane kii vaardaat ho yaa uske mahaz 4 din pehle jandaha main hi ek ke baad ek teen dukaanon main lut kii vaardaat
 Not only this, the accused of killing three policemen and robbing their pistols is also a member of this group
 group admin sumit urf raja to naa sirf ek wonted apradhi he balki bank lut main jail bhi ja chukaa he
 By using technology-based social media in the world of crime, these 22 criminals had killed the police department of Bihar and especially the Vaishali police
 magar police ne is group ke admin samet 5 aparaadhiyon ko dhar daboch kar whoscap ke is bhai group main koharaam laa diya
 It is believed that soon the remaining 17 criminals of Bhai Group will also be arrested

 In this situation, neither the Shiv Sena got the chief minister's post, nor did the 50-50 formula work and after separating from the BJP she returned to the pavilion after getting out on zero

 The statement came at a time when Congress was criticized for giving a clean chit by CBI to Italian arbitrator Ottavio Quattrocchi in the Bofors case
 isliye bijepi ne rahul ke is khulepan ko galati swikaarne ke bayaan ke taur par hi liya
 The BJP has long termed the CBI as the 'congress Bureau of Investigation', which works only at the behest of its political masters
 aam chunaav kareeb hai or yah chunaav rahul ko project karne ke lihaaj se congress ke liye kaaphi mahatvapurn hoga
 In such a situation, is there any similarity and conspiracy in the investigation not only against the opponents of the party, but also against allies like the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and Samajwadi Party (SP), which are unreliable and on many occasions? There is some investigation going on against important leaders of almost all such political parties, who can help in projecting Rahul

 But a year later, in December 2008, the CBI lawyer expressed his wish to withdraw the request on "advice from the government"

 This agency not only completed its investigation with unusual urgency to acquit Rahul from all charges, but in a highly unusual move, the CBI lawyer immediately went to the Supreme Court on August 24, 2011 and requested that Samarite CBI should also be considered as a party before the hearing on the appeal
 dilachasp yah he ki mayawati or mulaayam ke log apane netaaon kii pareshaani ke liye bijepi or congress donon par aarope lagaate hai
 Leader of Opposition in Uttar Pradesh Swami Prasad Maurya said, "BJP (in 2004) wanted to contest 60 seats in the Lok Sabha and used this case to pressure us

 However, many officials currently working in CBI say that it is not so easy to manipulate large cases because many of these are under the supervision of the court

 He questioned the appointment of several previous directors, including current chief Ranjit Sinha
 khaskar is niyam kii ore sanket karte hue ki chayan prakriya main vipakshi dalon ke netaaon kii koi bhoomika nahin hoti
 According to Joginder Singh, some shocking facts about cbi's dependence on the government is that CBI cannot initiate any investigation in a state without the approval of the Governor and its prosecution lawyers are only accountable to the Law Ministry

 Of course there is a film made with good thinking about a pet (getting a little hesitant using the word dog), but sajid-farhad seems to have missed the script
 chennai express, golmaal, housephul-2 jaisi film ke dialog likh chuki is jodi kii yah bataur diarector pehali film thi
 Expectations were on the seventh sky, but they made the film according to their dialogues and in which only entertainment has been tried, nothing else
 kahani main kitna damek kaarobaari mar jaataa he
 He has properties worth billions
 ek shaks (akshay kumaar) ko pataa chalata he ki vah uskaa nazaij pita tha
 When he reaches to claim the property, he sees that the dog (entertainment) has been made the heir by the businessman
 bas phir ek jaanavar se jaaydaad hathiyaane kii kahani shuru hoti he
 Then comes the flood of emotions
 prem kaa jowar uthta he
 The volcano erupts with laughter action
 masti bhare gaanon kaa chhaunk lagata he
 Just like sajid-farhad style jokes, jokes and jokes
 asal jindagi kii tarah hi film main bhi kai aise jokes hote hai, jin par aapako hansi aati he or kabhi nahin bhi aati he
 Then what Bollywood has always missed, it has done this time as well
 vah ek vishay centric film nahin bana paata or kai morchon par ek saath jutata he, isi chakkar main film puri tarah se bhaanumati kaa kunba ban jaati he
 Star Appeal Akshay Kumar's previous film Holiday touched a hundred crore mark at the box office
 lekin antkatenment main akshay kamedi lekar aae hai or kamjor kahani ke saath hai
 Well what they do is fun
 tamanna bhaatia south kii sansani hai
 Bollywood has not been able to collect coin yet
 pehle himmatwala, phir hamashakals or ab antertenment
 She looks good in the film
 lekin lambey samay se unhen majboot kirdaar main dekhne kii chahat he
 Johnny Lever, Mithun Chakraborty, Sonu Sood and Prakash Raj are also right
 kamai kii bangkshay kumaar ke us tarah ke samarpit fain nahin hai jaise shahrukh or salmaan khan ke hai
 But there are some audiences who like watching his film
 akshay kii antertenment unheen ke sahare he kyonki film puri tarah kamedi he or kahin-kahin imotional bhi
 Which is lacking in head and foot
 agar darshakon ne zyada lod na lete hue film ko dekhne kaa man banaaya to film box offis par acha kar sakati he kyonki gane achche hai or kamedi log dekh hi lete hai
 Anyway, Akshay's films are less in deficit
 baaki sab janata janardan par

 New generation film director Wilson Louis, who has been campaigning to free horror films from the captivity of stories like wandering spirits, ghosts and reincarnation, believes that India may soon become a major market for horror films because of fear Man has a natural quality

 But if new stories are used at the level of technology along with their story, then there may be a queue of people taking these films
 wilson ne kaha ki aisi filmon main koi nami giraami star cast na hone ke kaaran inkaa bajet bhi kam hota he
 In this case, recovery is also easy at the box office and profit is guaranteed to the manufacturers
 iske alaava satellite adhikaar dene ke evaj main bhi achche paise milte hai
 Also, such films can also be sent to the festival
 wilson kehete hai ki vah utkrisht drishyprabhav kii apni visheshgyata ke saath aisi filmon ko ek naye mode par pahunchaana chaahate hai jo darshakon ke bhay kii swaabhaavik chetana ko choote hue unhen manoranjan paros saken

 Some of the popular horror films so far are two yards below ground, Depth, Witchcraft, Red Rose, Guest House, Panic, Jani Dushman, Purana Mandir, Haveli, Veerana etc
 jabaki haal ke vashren main ramgopal verma kii film ‘ raat or ‘ koun ne bhi darshakon ko khub jhakzora

 input language signechar analysis ke mutabik, kisi kaa signechar yah bataata he ki vah logon ke bich kaisaa vyavhaar karata he or khud ko kaise sambhalata he
 But not all things are known by signature
 logon kaa swabhaav unke handriting se bhi pataa chalata he
 For example, it can be known from one's signature that there is always a smile on his face, but whether the person is really happy or not, it is only through his handwriting
 signechar achche or bure donon donon tarah ke hote hai
 Today we will tell you about 5 types of signature, which you should avoid
 1
 Strike-through signature If you write down your name while doing signature, then you need to change your signature soon
 mana jaataa he ki aisa signechar karne vaale log khud se khush nahin hote
 They have a tendency to punish themselves
 2008 main mumbai kii ek ladki ne aatmahatya kar liya tha
 a similar signature was also found in his suicide note
 uske aatmahatya karne kii vajah yah thi ki wo pariksha ke liye achche se taiyaar nahin thi
 2
 Camouflage signatureisasignecaraka yah matlab hota he ki aap pehle akshar par sarkal banaakar use chipa dete hai
 According to Signature Analysis, such signatories are always engaged in defending themselves, among others
 wo khud kii image ko lekar zyada chintit rahete hai
 Such people do not talk much to others, so they do not even have many friends
 unhen hameshaa yah dar laga rahata he ki bhaavnaatmak rup se unhen koi chot pahunchaa degaa
 But let us tell you that the signature of Mukesh Ambani is also similar
 3
 Small Signature is very short-sighted, showing that you lack self-confidence to do everyday work
 aisa signechar karne vaale log sochate hai ki unke paas luks, paisa, pratibha, safalataa sab cheez kii kami he
 They feel that they are not able to oppose anyone, so people target them
 in bhaawanaaon ke chalate bahut se log manovaigyanik samasyaon se jujhane lagate hai
 If you sign like this, change it soon
 4
 Track-back signature People have a habit of drawing the line from the last letter to the left while signing
 antim akshar se wo pen bhi nahin uthaate hai or usee tarah line khinch dete hai
 It is believed that such people always think about their past
 beeti chijen hi unke dimag main gumti rahati hai
 5
 Scribbled signatureapane naam ko ghaseet kar likhane vaale signechar ko Scribbled signature kehete hai
 People who sign such are always in a hurry
 agar aap unase puche ki aap aisa kyon karte hai, to unka jawaab hoga ki, mujhe din bhar main 100 kaagajon par sin karne hote hai, mere paas samay nahin rahata
 The brains of such signers run faster than the hand and some people think while signing this that i do not care whether you are able to understand my signature or not
 aisa sin karne waalon se galtiyaan bahut jaldi hoti hai
 It is better that you do not sign and write your full name
 bhale hi puraa naam likhane main aapako samay zyada lag saktaa he lekin aap sab kaam sahi samay par puraa kar paaenge

 saath hi trakon kii entry par bain or nirmaan kaaryon par lagaae pratibandh hataane ke nirdesh jari kiye
 These decisions were taken due to pollution in Delhi
 naagarik nikaay ne buudhvaar ko kaha ki shahar or iske upnagaron dakshin dilli nagar nigam ke tahat aane vaale kuch hisson main parking fees, jo ek hafte pehle chauguni ho gai thi, ab guuruuvaar se pichhali daron par waapas aa jaaegi
 SMDC and two other municipal corporations North Delhi Municipal Corporation and East Delhi Municipal Corporation were affected by the increased parking charge
 parivahan mantri kailash gahalot ne buudhvaar ko uparajyapal anil baijal se parking shulk main kii gai baari vruddhi par punarvichaar karne kaa aagrah kiya tha or kaha tha ki yah faisla jaldbaaji main liya gaya he

 The EPCA stated that they received information that the Civic Agency could not implement it effectively
 jisaki vajah se trekkic kii samasya badi
 EPCA feels that increasing parking prices would be very helpful for people to leave cars / vehicles, but this did not happen because there was a lack of public transport and illegal parking was not taken strictly

 The DTC is an ambitious tax reform that will replace the half-century old direct tax law

 par uski gavaahi kabhi apane vajood ke kaam nahin ai
 Over the centuries, she got entangled in political controversy
 masjid or mandir ke daavon main bantati gai
 Even today, both claims about Ayodhya are elevated
 is par faisla ab adaalat ko karnaa he
 It is a matter of August of this year
 desh kii sabase oonchi adaalat main jab 7 saal baad mukademe ke dastavej khule, tab do raste dikhe the-ek rasta sarvocch adaalat ke antim faisle kaa or doosraa pakshakaron ke bich aapasi sulah kaa
 In the language of the law, it is called the Out of Court Settlement, which was suggested by a bench headed by Chief Justice Deepak Mishra
 chaaho to aapas main mil baithkar maamla sulajhaa lo
 The court will respect any decision in which the three parties to the trial have equal consent
 haalanki sulah yaa uske kisi formule kaa supreme court kii sunwaayee se koi sidhaa lenaa-dena nahin he
 The three parties of the temple-mosque dispute are also face to face with documentary evidence of Ayodhya and their own witnesses
 bataa den ki elahabaad hai court ne saal 2010 main arase baad apana faisla sunaaya to teenon pakshakaar ne supremecourt kaa darwaja khatkhataya or tittle cese main yachika lagaayee
 The High Court formula and the SC appealed in Allahabad High Court divided the entire disputed premises into three equal parts
 ramalala kii murti vaali jagah court ne ramalala virajman paksh ko di, jabaki sita rasoi or ram chabutara nirmohi akhaade ke hawaale kiya
 The court gave one third of the rest to the Sunni Waqf Board
 hoicourt ke faisle se koi pakshakaar sahamat nahin hui or unhone faislon ko supremecourt main chunauti di
 In this way all the parties reached the Supreme Court
 samjhaute kii koshishbta den ki elahabaad hai court ke is faisle ke baad kuch or bhi pakshakaar saamne aae, jinamein shiya vakf board khud ko ahm paksh maanata he
 It is the same Shia Waqf Board, which suggested a formula to end the temple-mosque dispute led by Sri Sri Ravi Shankar
 lekin sunni central vakf board iske formule se ittifaq nahin rakhata
 The Sunni Board rejects any claim in the case of the Shia Waqf Board
 sunni vakf board kaa ye rukh 1946 se hi he, jab faijabad jila nyaayalay ne masjid kii jameen par shiya vakf board kaa daawa khaarij kar diya
 The Shia Board claimed in court in 1940 that the Babri Masjid belonged to the Shia community, so it should be given the ownership of it
 lekin adaalat ne uskaa daawa khaarij kar diya
 Since then, the Sunni Waqf Board has been lobbying in the court on behalf of Babri Masjid
 lihaaja shiya vakf board kaa formula koun sune?vakf act kaa penchashia vakf board ne haalanki masjid par malikana haq ko lekar supreme court main bhi yachika lagaai he
 But according to the Waqf Act of 2013, there is one more screw
 act kii dhara 29 ke mutabik koi bhi vakf board masjid, kabristaan yaa dargah jaisi dharmik jagah or uski jameen ko naa to bech saktaa he or naa hi kisi bhi rup main iskaa transfar kar saktaa
 So there seems no way of reconciliation on this path
 adaalat se hi nikalegaa halaakhri samjhaute kii surat ab adaalat main hi dikhti he
 For this, the temple parties want to hear the case daily, but the advocates of the mosque side are not in any such hurry
 iske alaava ek pench ye bhi he ki supremecourt main jo dastavej jamaa kiye gaye hai, wo farsi, arabi sahit kai bhashaaon main hai, jinke anuwaad bhi hone the
 Only then will the Supreme Court fully understand the case
 jaldbaaji sirf ayodhya ko lekar siyasat main he, varna kanoonee lihaaj se to ayodhya main aadesh yathasthiti banaae rakhane ke hi hai
 The order was delivered by the Supreme Court on 9 May 2011
 tab court ne elahabaad hai court ke bantwaare ke formule par roak lagaai thi or saare pakshon kii apil sunne kii baat kahi thi
 Since then, water in Ayodhya has flowed a lot
 dikhne main ayodhya ke kinare kii sarayu nadi ab bhi waisi hi shant he, magar 6 saal main badali siyasat ke saath dharmanagari kaa paracham bhi badal chukaa he
 i would appeal to all of you, especially the youth, that if someone tries to create discrimination on the basis of caste and religion, then all the youth should unite and fight against it and understand this reality

 He married Manju at the Arya Samaj temple

 But when he got no protection from the police, he asked his old girlfriend Bhuri for help to hide Manju in the house
 subhash sepremamen dhokhaa khai bhuri ko yah nagavar gujara

 Under this plan, he first poisoned Subhash on Tuesday night

 iske baavjood rahul ne unke saath manch saajha karne se parhez kiya
 Now when Lalu is convicted in the fodder scam case
 iske baavjood rahul gandhi kaa ames jaakar milanaa siyasat ke badale sameekaran kii ore ishaara kar rahaa he jisamen daanv par 2019 kii baaji he
 In the current state of politics, the Congress is not in the political position to single-handedly prevent the Modi-led BJP from coming to power in 2019
 party vipaksh ko ekajute karne kii koshish main he lekin tiemasi pramukh mamata banerjee or telugana ke siem ke chandrashekhar raav gaiyrcongressi or garabijepi third frand kii kavayad main jute hai
 If Lalu Yadav's RJD supports this exercise, the Congress and Rahul's plans to return to power in 2019 may fail
 yahi vajah he ki rahul gandhi apane siyaasi kile ko majboot karne main lage hai
 RJD is a major political force in the politics of Bihar
 laluke jail jane ke baad party kii kaman unke bete tejasvi yadav ke haath main he
 He is constantly engaged in strengthening the party
 nitish se alag hone ke baavjood bihar main argedy or congress kaa gathbandhan jari he
 Rahul and Tejashwi are working to strengthen it
 isi ke maddenjar pichley dinon rahul gandhi ne tejasvi ke saath lunch bhi kiya tha, jise donon netaaon kii lunch diplomasi kaha gaya tha
 After meeting Tejashwi, Rahul himself met Lalu Yadav himself
 haalanki ise shishtachar bhent bataaya ja rahaa he kyonki lalu kii tabiyat thik nahin he or wo ames main apana ilaaj karvaa rahe the lekin ye mulaakaat aise samay main hui he, jab congress ne ek din pehle hi ramlila maidan se jan aakrosh raily ke jariye 2019 ke chunaav abhiyaan kaa aagaaj kiya he
 Therefore, this meeting is also not considered untouched by politics
 lalu yadav khulkar congress or rahul ke samarthan main bol rahe hai
 Recently, he had clearly said that without Congress, the talk of third fund is incomplete
 haalanki rahul ke netritv ke sawaal ko wo taal gaye the
 The Congress is excited by the alliance of Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati
 agar lalu-tejasvi kaa bharosa jeetne main kaamyaab rahi to upi-bihar jaise bade rajyon main apane simit janaadhar ke baavjood party modi or amit shah kaa vijay rath rokane main kaamyaab ho sakati he
 This is the reason why Rahul has forgotten the 2014 election campaign and Lalu Prasad Yadav is also ready to forget how he got out of electoral politics as he was convicted due to tearing of Rahul's ordinance

 Describing the allegations made in the motion of no confidence in the house as completely untrue and baseless, Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan has said that the opposition wants to spread confusion in the state on the basis of untrue allegations, but the public has the trust of the public
 chouhan ne avishvaas prastaav par sadan main chaar din tak hui charchaa kaa uttar dete hue silsilewar vipaksh ke aaropon kaa jawaab diya or kaha ki vipaksh aarope lagaaye or sarkaar kii kamiyaan ujagar kare, lekin aarope asaty or niraadhaar nahin hone chaiye
 Referring to the Congress' claims of falling the third wicket in Madhya Pradesh after the Congress lost two wickets as Chief Minister in Karnataka and Uttarakhand, Chauhan said that he does not consider politics as a game of cricket, but rather it is a service to the public
 The medium believes and is working in this direction

 The series between Team India and Pakistan is still stuck
 bharat sarkaar ne is series ko lekar abhi tak hami nahin bhari he
 The PCB has increased its deadline twice, but the hope is now broken
 dwipaksheeya series par to koi faisla nahin ho paaya he, lekin world tii-20 kii tarikhon kaa elaan ho gaya he
 It has a match plan between India and Pakistan on March 19 in Dharamshala
 aise main kai jaankaar ye sawaal bhi uthaa rahe he ki kya pakistan bharat main world tii-20 khilne ko taiyaar hoga? pisibi adhikariyon ne saaf kaha tha ki agar dwipaksheeya series nahin hui to world tii-20 ke bare main unhen sochna padegaa
 But if Pakistan boycott the match with India citing security reasons, then ICC rules may put them in trouble
 bahishkaar karne par isisi pisibi par jurmaana laga sakati he
 The amount of the fine may increase upon boycotting the entire tournament
 isisi jurmaana na lagaakar sirf bharat ke saath na khilne par paak ke point bhi kaat sakati he
 Or taking a strong step to boycott the entire tournament, Pakistan can also be suspended for some time
 anuraag thakur ne is mudde par chutki lete hue kaha ki 'bharat or pakistan ke bich rishton main jo garmi ai he uske liye dharmashala jaisi thandi jagah par match karana sahi faisalaa he

 In such a situation, many experts are also raising the question whether Pakistan will be ready to play World T20 in India? PCB officials had clearly said that they would have to think about the World T20 if there was no bilateral series
 lekin agar suraksha kaarnon kaa hawala dete hua pakistan ne bharat ke saath match kaa bahishkaar kiya to isisi ke niyam unhen mushkil main daal sakate hai
 The ICC may impose a penalty on the PCB for boycotting it
 jurmaane kii rakam puure toornament kaa bahishkaar karne par bad sakati he
 ICC can also deduct Pakistan's points for not playing with India by imposing a fine
 yaa phir kadaa kadam uthaate hue puure toornament kaa bahishkaar karne par pakistan ko kuch vakt ke liye suspend bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 Anurag Thakur took a dig at the issue and said that it is the right decision to match in a cool place like Dharamshala for the heat that has grown in the relationship between India and Pakistan

 loksabhaa chunaav 2019keopchaarik shankhanaad se pehle hi sabhi partiyon ne aghoshit taur par chunavi bigul phoonk diya he
 Just before the Lok Sabha elections, now the stir in the politics of Uttar Pradesh has intensified and all are preparing to stake their claim on the political situation
 upi main siyaasi baaji apane naam karne ke liemayawati or akhilesh yadavane rashtriya str par congress kemhagathbandhan kii kavayadon ko joardaar jhatka diya he or upi main basapa-sapa gathbandhan kaa anaupchaarik elaan kar diya he
 In fact, in Lucknow, SP chief Akhilesh and BSP chief Mayawati will hold a joint press conference at Taj Hotel and formal announcement regarding SP-BSP alliance
 haalanki, isse pehle hi upi main mahagathbandhan main siton ko lekar sahyogiyon main khinchataan kii baat saamne ai he
 The SP-BSP may have taken the Rashtriya Lok Dal with them, but the RLD is unhappy with the seat sharing
 areldi pramukh ajit singh ne kaha he ki unki party sapa-basapa mahagathbandhan kaa hissaa he, magar abhi tak siton par baat nahin hui he
 Ajit Singh said that the SP and BSP will decide on the Congress whether to keep it in the coalition in view of the Lok Sabha elections
 haalanki, sutron kii maane to areldi ne sapa-basapa gathbandhan se 5 siton kii maang kii he, jabaki sapa-basapa gathbandhan areldi ko teen siten dene ko taiyaar he
 In fact, the five seats RLD has demanded are Hathras, Kairana, Baghpat, Muzaffarnagar and Kairana
 haalanki, abhi tak siton par puri tarah se sahmati nahin bani he
 Actually, Jayant Chaudhary went to Lucknow to meet Akhilesh Yadav two days ago to finalize the negotiations on the seats
 vahaan akhilesh yadav ne unhen siton ko lekar bharosa dilaayaa he
 Bahrahal will not attend Jayant Chaudhary's press conference at the shared press conference of Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati on Saturday
 bataa den ki shanivaar ko lakhanu main taj hotel main akhilesh yadav or mivati saajha press conference karengi or mahagathbandhan kaa aupchaarik elaan karengi
 However, there is a buzz in the political corridors that these two big parties of Uttar Pradesh, ie SP-BSP, will contest together in 37-37 Lok Sabha seats
 bataa den ki uttar pradesh main loksabhaa kii kul 80 siten hai
 There is also a discussion in the political streets of UP that the seats of Amethi and Rae Bareli will be left in the BSP-SP alliance and no candidate will be fielded there
 iske baad jo siten batch rahi hai usase rashtriya lokdal or anya choti partiyon ke liye choda jaayegaa
 That is, if the alliance between SP and BSP is proved right, it means that the Congress will not be a part of this alliance and SP-BSP will make a strong effort to connect other regional parties of UP
 is tarah se dekha jaae to sapa-basapa kaa sangam hota he to congress bada jhatka to hoga
 At the same time, it will not be less than a big setback for BJP
 sapa-basapa kaa gathbandhan na sirf congress , balki bijepi ke liye bhi sirdard he
 To understand the shock of the Congress as well as the BJP, one will need to look at the vote share of Lok Sabha Elections 2014
 darasal, 2014 main bhale hi basapa ko ek bhi seat nahin mil pai thi, magar uskaa vot fisadi sapa ke kareeb hi tha
 The 2014 Lok Sabha elections had emerged as the single largest party and surprised everyone by winning 71 out of 80 seats
 us vakt 71 siten jeetne vaali bijepi ne record kareeb 42 fisadi vot hasil kiye the
 At the same time, Samajwadi Party had 5 seats with about 22 percent votes
 2014 main mayawati kii basapa ko ek bhi seat nahin mil pai thi, magar uske kareeb 20 fisadi vot the
 At the same time, the Congress had won the seats of Rae Bareli and Amethi and secured around 7 per cent vote share
 khabar yah bhi he ki mayawati or akhilesh yadav ke sapa-basapa ko lekar aupchaarik elaan se pehle upi congress kii team bhi dilli main marathon baithak karegi or aage kii ranneeti par charchaa karegi
 The Congress will also discuss the future strategy in view of the BSP-SP alliance and will include Raj Babbar and PL Punia
 bataa den ki vidhansabha chunaav main jahaan bijepi ko 39
 SP and BSP got 22% if they got 6% votes
 donon ke voton ko mila den to 44 fisadi ho jaataa he
 The Congress got only 6 percent of the votes
 vahiin, baat karen loksabhaa chunaav 2014 kii to bijepi ko uttar pradesh main 42
 6% of the votes were received
 sapa ko 22 fisadi or bispi ko 20 fisadi vot mili the
 However, there are reports that the seat sharing may be finalized after January 15
