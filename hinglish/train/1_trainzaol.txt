 america raashtrapati donald trump or pakistan ke pradhanmantri imran khan kii somvaar ko white house main hui mulaakaat vivaadon se bharpoor rahi
 First, the statement made by Donald Trump on Kashmir issue, India became enraged
 isi press conference main unhone afghanistan ke mudde par bhi bolaa, trump bole ki main afgaan war ek hafte main jeet saktaa tha, lekin main 10 million logon ko maarna nahin chahta
 Actually, when questions started in the press conference on the issue of Afghanistan, Donald Trump said that we also want Pakistan's support on this issue
 isi bich jab reporter ne poocha ki pichley dedh dashak se jo chal rahaa he, wo kab khatm hoga
 On this, Trump said that our administration has taken a lot of steps towards ending this in the recent past
 isi dauraan unhone kaha, ‘ham vahaan par ek puliceman kii tarah kaam kar rahe hai, koi jang nahin lard rahe hai
 If i had to fight a war in Afghanistan and win it, i could do it in a week
 lekin main 10 million (1 karod) logon ko maarna nahin chahta
 Do you like it? No, i don't want to do that '
 gauratlab he ki afghanistan or america ke bich ye vivaad 2001 se jari he, lekin abhi tak khatm nahin hua he
 Meanwhile, in the past, the US has started withdrawing its troops present in Afghanistan
 ab somvaar ko imran khan ke saath mulaakaat ke dauraan america raashtrapati ne kaha ki vah pakistan ko bhi is mudde main shaamil karnaa chaahate hai
 Significantly, there has always been a demand from Afghanistan that India will be included in the US if anyone talks about the peace issue

 com / covihcy2ua — ANI (@ANI) May 8, 2018 Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya want to avenge the SP-BSP alliance by winning this seat on their respective seats
 vahiin akhilesh-mayawati apni jeet ke silsile ko kairana main bhi har haal main barkaraar rakhana chahengi
 In such a situation, the state of political war is being laid once again on the land of Kairana
 beti ne sanbhali pita kii viraasatabata den ki 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main kairana sansadeey seat se bijepi ke hukum singh ne jeet darj kii thi
 The by-election is being held due to his death on 3 February this year
 bijepi ne is seat se hukum singh kii beti mriganka singh ko chunaav maidan main utaara he
 Mriganka may receive a sympathy vote because of the father's death
 haalanki, mriganka vidhansabha chunaav main kismat aajamaa chuki hai lekin sapa ke nahid hasan se maat khaani padi thi
 The assembly election consists of five assembly seats under the Karana Lok Sabha seat
 is loksabhaa seat main shamali jile kii thanabhavan, kairana or shamali vidhansabha siton ke alaava saharanpur jile ke gangoh va nakud vidhansabha siten aati hai
 Currently, BJP has four of these five assembly seats and SP of Kairana assembly seat
 in siton par bijepi ko 2017 main 4 lakh 33 hajaar vot mili the
 While BSP candidates got 2 lakh 8 thousand and 3 SP candidates got 1 lakh 6 thousand votes
 sapa ne shamali va nakud siten congress ko de di thi
 Kairana Lok Sabha seat, a political history of the Kairana Lok Sabha, came into existence in 1962
 tab se lekar ab tak 14 baar chunaav ho chuke hai
 In these, Congress and BJP have been able to win elections twice
 ye seat alag-alag raajnneetik dalon ke khate main jaati rahi he
 Yashpal Singh won the Kairana Lok Sabha seat for the first time as an independent candidate
 1967 main socialist party, 1971 main congress, 1977 main janata party, 1980 main janata party (secular), 1984 main congress, 1989, 1991 main congress, 1996 main sapa, 1998 main bijepi, 1999 or 2004 main rashtriya lokdal, 2009 main basapa or 2014 main bijepi ne jeet darj kar chuki he
 The caste equation of Kairana has 17 lakh voters in Kairana Lok Sabha seat which includes five lakh Muslims, four lakh backward (jat, Gurjars, Saini, Kashyap, Prajapati and others) and 1
5 lakh votes are Jatav Dalits and close to 1 lakh non-jat Dalit voters
 kairana seat gurjar bahul maani jaati he
 There are three lakh Gurjar voters here, including both Hindu and Muslim Gurjars
 isiilie is seat par gurjar samudaay ke ummidavaaron ne zyaadaatar baar jeet darj kii hai
 Muslim politics in Kairana Despite Muslim population in Kairana, Muslim mps have been elected only four times in 14 Lok Sabha elections
 2014 ke chunaav main bijepi ke hukum singh ke khilaaf do muslim ummidavaar the
 The SP fielded Nahid Hasan and the BSP fielded Kanwar Hasan
 2013 main mujffarnagar dange ke chalate voton kaa dhruvikaran hua or do muslim pratyaashee ke hone se muslim vot bantane kaa phayda hukum singh ko mila
 Equation of votes: BJP got 5 lakh 65 thousand 909 votes
 jabaki sapa ko 3 lakh 29 hajaar 81 vot or basapa ko 1 lakh 60 hajaar 414 vot
 In such a situation, even if SP-BSP votes are added, BJP is ahead
 lekin 2014 or 2018 kii kahani alag he
 If the SP-BSP votes are seen in 2017 and the by-elections are estimated accordingly, then the sp-bsp's friendship may be overshadowed by the BJP
 aisa hua to phir kya hogakairana main sapa ke mul vot yadav mat kam hai, lekin musalamaanon kii aabaadi badi taadaad main he, jo sapa kaa hi votbank mana jaataa he
 While Dalit votes are very important in this seat
 upi ke pichley upachunaav kii tarah agar basapa kaa vot sapa kii jholii main jaataa he to bijepi ke liye mushkilen khadi ho sakati hai
 Whereas BJP will try to repeat history like 2014 by uniting their votes once

 tippaniyan According to her, she was working with director Mansoor Ali Khan as the fourth assistant director in the film 'jo Jeeta Wahi Sikander'

 ) All these speculations on whether the SP-BSP will contest jointly in the 2019 elections have been stopped by senior Samajwadi Party leader Ram Gopal Yadav

 He said that "there is a 100 percent alliance between the SP-BSP"
 duusari ore mulaayam singh kii bahu aparnaa yadav ne ek samachar agency se baat karte hua kaha ki agar mauka mila to shivpal chachaa sapa-basapa gathbandhan main shaamil ho sakate hai

 lekin ram gopal yadav ke bayaan se is baat ko bal mila he ki donon partiyaan milakar maidan main utrengi
 On the other hand, there are speculations that the Congress will not be included in it because the bjp's vote is not divided due to the Congress joining the coalition

 duusari ore mulaayam singh kii choti bahu aparnaa yadav ne kaha he ki agar mauka mila to shivpal chachaa sapa-basapa gathbandhan main shaamil ho sakate hai
 He said that the terms of the alliance will be discussed after the offer comes

 Bollywood's best actress Sridevi has acted in nearly 300 films
 pichley dinon shridevi ne ek intervyuu main bataaya tha ki jahnavi sadma ko dekhne ke baad kaaphi pareshaan ho gayi thim or us samay wo keval 6 saal kii thim
 He told that my daughter did not talk to me for 3 days simply because she left Kamal Haasan in the film
 sadma ke ant kaa asar bahut gaharaa padaa tha
 Sridevi told- Jahnavi was about 6 years old when she saw the film
 usne mujhase kaha tum gandi mamma ho
 You did wrong with that
 actress ne bataaya ki is film main camel hasan kaa kirdaar kaaphi bhaavnaatmak or intens tha
 My character was like children, so there was no emotional connection for me like the fans felt after watching the film
 shridevi kii maut se khud unke ko star camel hasan bahut dukhi he
 Expressing his feelings, he wrote that the shock lamas are scaring me
 Have witnessed Sridevi's life from an adolescent teenager to the magnificeint lady she became
 Her stardom was well deserved
 Many happy moments with her flash through my mind including the last time i met her
 Sadma's lullaby haunts me now
 We'll miss her— Kamal Haasan (@ikamalhaasan)february 25, 2018beti jahnavi ko lekar shridevi kaa vah sapana jo puraa nahin ho payaek khwaahish puri naa ho saki
 Sridevi's desire to see her beloved daughter Jahwavi on the silver screen remained incomplete
 jahnavi film 'dhadak' se bollywood main debyue kar rahi hai
 The shooting of the film has also started
 lekin dukhad baat ye he ki jis khaas pal kaa shridevi ko lambey samay se intjaar tha, vah apane unke bina hi puraa hoga

 According to sources, Pradeep Mathur has complained to UP general secretary in-charge Ghulam Nabi Azad and has also sought time to meet party president Sonia Gandhi
 sutron ke mutabik, pradeep maathur ne apni shikaayat main kaha ki wo 5 baar ke vidhayak or party ke vidhayak dal ke netaa hai, lekin pike ne unako jaise koodaydaan main daal diya he
 Generally, the leader of the legislative party plays an important role in the election strategy of a state along with the in-charge and the state president
 lekin upi ke maamle main naa hi unako kisi ahm baithak main bulaayaa jaataa he or na hi koi jaankaree di jaati he
 Mathur also expressed displeasure over the fact that he was not given a place in the posters of the party
 pike katwanaa chaahate hai tiktapradip maathur ne pike par aarope lagate hue kaha ki brahman card ke naam par pike unki tikat katwa dena chaahate hai
 At the behest of PK, a youth named Shyam Sundar Upadhyay is getting his poster-banner installed on a large scale in his constituency
 isse unke ilaake main charchaa ho rahi he ki congress unka tikat kaat rahi he
 Also, this thing is also hurting his height
 yadi unka tikat nahin bhi katataa to bhi iskaa nuksaan unako jhelana pad jayega
 Rahul's patronized PK
 Actually, Congressmen realize that Rahul Gandhi has full support for PK
 sutara bataate hai ki isi kaaran aaazaad se shikaayat karne ke baad ab pradeep maathur ne sidhe sonia se milane kaa vakt maanga he
 In this regard, when Aaj Tak spoke to Pradeep Mathur, he said that there are certain issues, about which he has spoken to Azad Saheb and has also sought time with Soniaji
 'bijepi ko kadamon main rakhata hum'bijepi main jane ke sawaal ko nakaarte hue maathur ne kaha, 'bijepi ke puraane netaa jepi maathur se bhi meri rishtedaari thi, tab bhi main congress kaa hi sipaahi tha
 Nowadays i have a relationship with Om Mathur, in charge of UP BJP
 lekin bijepi jaisi party main jane kaa sawaal hi nahin he

 Air pollution is highest in Delhi from October to March
 hawa ko saaf banaae rakhane ke liye rajya sarkaar ko kai ahm kadam uthaanaa padataa he, lekin dilli main supreme court or hycourt ke aadesh ko bhi puri taraf nazarandaaz kiya jaataa he
 Now the Aam Aadmi Party government of Delhi says that there is pollution coming from the brick kilns of neighboring states
 aam aadmi party sarkaar ke mutabik pradooshan se nipatane ke liye kai ahm kadam uthaae gaye hai
 According to the Delhi government, the NTPC plant has been closed on 15 October in view of the increase in poisonous gas air
 iske alaava dust control karne ke liye makaan yaa sadak ke nirmaan kaa malba dhakkar le jane ke aadesh die gaye hai
 Also, the agency related to the land has been given the responsibility for its investigation
 sarkaar kaa daawa he ki dilli main khule main kooda or pattey nahi jalaane ke aadesh hai
 If garbage is burning in an area then SDM has the power to take action
 peedblyoody kii sadakon ke bich divyder ko pani se saaf kiya jaataa he
 It happens once a week
 is kaam ke liye mashine rent par bhi lee jaati hai
 However, the reality is that all rules are scrapped
 sarkaar ko dilli main un tamaam badi industry kii jaanch kerani hoti he, jo ek level ke baad adhik pradooshan failaati hai
 If pollution increases against the rules then action is taken
 sarkaar ne isaki jaanch ke liye 5 sadsy team bhi banaai he
 Also, the Delhi government has released a whatsapp number, on which you can complain about burning garbage by sending a picture of garbage
 dilli main aise trakon kii entry bhi pratibandhit he jo dilli ke raaston ko bypass kii tarah istemaal karte hai yaa un trakon main dilli kaa saamaan lod nahi hota he
 Delhi Traffic Police is responsible for checking these trucks
 dilli sarkaar main paryaavaran mantri imran hossain kaa kahana he ki pradooshan kii vajah se dilli main od-evan laayaa gaya tha jise logon ne kaaphi saraahaa tha
 According to Imran Hussain, on the issue of pollution, the government holds meetings with all agencies every week or 15 days
 hossain kaa kahana he ki ensiaar me chal rahe eent ke bhatton se dilli main pradooshan aata he
 In such a situation, the neighboring state governments will have to work together only then the problem of pollution will be solved better
 haalanki od-evan dobaaraa dilli main laane ke sawaal ko hossain ne taalte hue kaha ki dilli kii sehat ko dekhte hue jo zarurat padegi vaisaa karenge

 Electric-water facilities are in bad shape

 In many cases, the state government was accused of corruption here

 " The government may increase the income tax exemption limit in the coming budget
 is kadam ke peeche sarkaar kii koshish logon ke haath main zyada paisa chhodane kii hogi, jisase khapat ko badhaava mil sake or arthvyavastha kaa sust padaa pahiyaa raftaar pakad sake
 Consumption accounts for about 60 per cent of GDP
 isse pehle bhi vitt mantri arthvyavastha ko sahaara dene ke liye kai elaan kar chuki hai
 The main ones were the corporate tax cuts and the relief given to the real estate sector
 lekin in kadamon kaa koi khaas asar abhi dekhne ko nahin mila he
 For example, neither a company has announced a huge capital expenditure after deducting corporate tax nor announced any special exemption on any products
 atake project or anbike makaanon ke aankade bhi bahut nahin badale
 Even cheap loans could not show any significant effect in this direction
 gauratlab he arabiai farvari se aktubar ke dauraan paanch baar nitigat daron main 135 basis point kii katautee kar chukaa he
 Cheap debt, under inflation, all efforts to support the economy did not prove to be effective
 ab daanv logon ke haath main zyada paisa dene par he
 That is, the exemption limit of income tax should be increased and people should be encouraged to spend more by paying more money
 lekin bada sawaal yah he ki tex main mili raahat kya itani prerak hogi ki log kharch karne lagen?ghar or gaadi khareednaa sthaayee khapat badhane ke sabase sateek paimaane hai
 Cars and home shopping are good days
 lekin is kharidari ke liye saste karj or saste ghar yaa car se zyada jaruri bhavishya ko lekar bharosa hota he
 Only when a person is confident about his future will he be able to muster up the courage to take a loan for the next five to twenty years
 yahi kaaran he ki makaanon or kaaron kii sabase zyada bikri us daur main hui thi jab mahangaai charam par thi or karj bhi mahangaa
 What confidence will return if people leave a little more money in their hands? Because if this were to happen, the amount received from the implementation of the Seventh Pay Commission in the past years, after reducing the rate of GST, would have some effect after the inflation
 aisa nahin he ki logon ke paas paisa nahin he
 Because if it were, then people would not jump into the market as soon as good investment options were seen in the market
 iarsitisi kaa ipio safal hona, share bazaar kaa apane ucchtam str par hona, mutual fund main nirantar nivesh iske taaja udhaaharan hai
 It is more important to consider that what is the need to leave more money in the hands of the people or to return confidence in the economy? Because the step of tax cut will not benefit the public, but its injury to the public exchequer is 100% fixed
 arthvyavastha main bharosa laute iske liye buniyadi dhaanche par bade sarkari nivesh kii jarurat he
 Corporates who have been given major reductions need to be constrained to capital investment in the economy
 kyonki bade nivesh se rojgaar or maang donon ke raste kholenge
 With the creation of new jobs, confidence in the economy will be returned and at that time people will be able to muster up the courage to buy a house and a car even if the debt is not cheap

 yani 17 saal se rus kii satta par is shaks kii kisi na kisi rup main tuuti bol rahi he
 Putin retired in 1991 at the rank of lieutenant colonel after 16 years of service as an officer in Russia's intelligence agency KGB
 iske baad unhone raajnneeti kii duniya main kadam rakhaa
 In 1996, he managed to make a place in the administration of the then President Boris Yeltsin

 Care should be taken in the future regarding such statements

 unhone likhaa, main 'da laughter chalange sho' main hue vivaad ke bare main baat karnaa chaahuungi, is sho main ek ghanti he, jise jaj contestant kii behtareen parformens ko dekhte hue bajaate hai
 In such a situation, when Miss Dua was about to ring the bell, Mr
 Kumar said- 'mallika ji ring the bell, i play you
 ' yah ek dialog ko mazaaki andaaj main kehane kaa tarika tha jise ki ek aadmi or aurat donon hi upyog karte hai

 After which Mallika shared a video clip of this statement of Akshay on social media and asked if anyone felt this entertainment? After this, Mallika Dua's father and well-known journalist, Vinod Dua, wrote in his post, objecting to the statement of Akshay Kumar, Akshay Kumar is the great head

 maharashtra main bijepi or shivasena ke bich poster waar ab majaak kii had se aage badhkar jubaani jang tak pahunch gaya he
 On Wednesday, the Shiv Sena warned in unambiguous terms that a BJP leader compared his chief Uddhav Thackeray to the jailer of the film 'sholay' and the party would not tolerate it at all
 isse pehleshivsenaane mangalvaar ko bijepi adhyaksh amit shah kaa majaak udaane vaale poster chaspaan kiye or party kii shahar ikai ke pramukh ashish shellar kaa dakshin mumbai main putala foonka
 This policy of party chief in lieu of party chief has further intensified the tussle between the two alliance partners
 haalanki is ore centre main sattashin bijepi ne bhi chetaya he ki yadi shivasena netritv apane kaaryakartaaon par lagaam kasne main vifal rahata he to vah makul jawaab dene main sakasham he
 The whole controversy started with Bhandari's article
 Actually, this whole Majra started with an article by Madhav Bhandari, the chief spokesperson of the party in bjp's publication 'manogat'
 aalekh main bhandari ne shivasena ko satta se alag hone kii chunauti di thi or party pramukhuddhav thakreki tulana ‘sholay’ main hasya kalakaar asraani kii jailer vaali bhoomika se kii thi
 Shocked by this comparison, Shiv Sena activists on Tuesday released posters in the city, in which Amit Shah and Madhav Bhandari are seen in the costumes of 'sholay' characters
 isamen amit shah ko mukhya villen gabbar singh ke rup main dikhaaya gaya
 There has been resentment about effigy burning earlier, Shiv Sena has also burnt effigy of Ashish Shelar, head of BJP city unit
 jabaki kuch dinon pehle hi bijepi ne shivasena ko party netaaon ke putala dahan ke khilaaf chetaya tha
 Reacting to the issue, 'BJP remains calm despite provocation', State BJP secretary and Legislative Councilor Sujit Singh Thakur said, 'BJP has remained quiet despite incessant incitement by Shiv Sena workers in the last few days
 agar koi iskaa doosraa arth nikaal rahe hai to unhen spasht rup se yah samajhnaa chahie ki bijepi makul jawaab dene ke liye sakasham he

 Just a few days ago, he signed a deal of Rs 110 crore with Puma, the famous global brand that makes sports accessories, under which he was appointed by Puma as its brand ambassador for the Indian market
 vahiin haal hi main khabar ai thi ki viraat kohli kii ab ek din kii fees 5 karod rupee ho gai he
 Former Delhi CM Sheila Dixit has now returned to the capital
 lautate hi unhone dhamaakaa kar diya he
 Less in Delhi politics and more in his party
 unhone bayaan de daalaa ki agar bijepi ke paas sarkaar banane ke liye paryaapt number hai to use sarkaar bana lenaa chahie
 As soon as his statement came, there was silence in the party
 unhen pasand na karne vaale kuch netaaon ne unke khilaaf jabardast bayaan de daale
 a former Congress MLA even demanded his removal from the party
 party ne unke bayaan se kinaaraa kar liya
 On the other hand, Aam Aadmi Party convenor Arvind Kejriwal, who considers Delhi his personal property, screamed
 unhone aanan-fanan main bayaan de diya ki bijepi or congress andarkhaane mili hue hai
 But he forgot his time when he formed the government with the help of Congress and left himself
 unhen yah bilkul pasand nahin aa rahaa he ki congress unki party ke alaava bijepi kaa saath de
 He is angry at this statement and is reacting strongly
 unka maananaa he ki sarkaar banane kaa aamantran bijepi ko nahin milanaa chahie
 But Kejriwal's problem is unwarranted
 dilli vidhansabha main bijepi ab bhi sabase badi party he or sarkaar banane ke liye agar use up rajyapal aamantran dete hai to usamen galat kya he? baharhaal usase bhi zyada mahatvapurn he shila dikshit kaa bayaan
 Those who know Sheila Dixit or know her style of politics know that she recognizes the pulse of time
 unhen dilli kii raajnneeti kii gaharaai kaa andaja he
 His statement is not a spontaneous statement
 vah jaanati hai ki unki party kii lokapriyata is samay dharaatal main he or use uthne main vakt lagegaa
 Therefore, if elections are held immediately, then his party will not benefit
 vidhayakon kii taadaad main shaayad hi koi badhotaree ho
 But if a government is formed, the future of the party will be dependent on its work

 Pakistan and China were once again exposed to the United Nations Security Council (UNSC)
 kashmir mudde ko yuanessi main le jane ke liye pakistan apane ajij dost china ke aage gidgidaaya lekin phir bhi donon kii chaal kaamyaab nahin hui
 After the meeting, China made such a statement so that Pakistan would also be happy and India would not be angry
 vahiin rus ne ek baar phir bharat se dosti nibhaate hue kaha ki yah antarrashtriya nahin balki donon deshon ke bich kaa maamla he
 Actually, supporting Pakistan has now become a compulsion of China
 china ke rajdoot ne kaha, yah jaahir he ki bharat ne jo sanvaidhanik sanshodhan kiya he or isse sthiti badal gai he
 China expressed concern over this and said that any unilateral decision should be avoided and doing so is not valid
 china kaa yah bayaan saaf taur par dikhaata he ki usne bharat ke prati koi aakraamak rukh nahin apanaaya he
 He did what he could to make Pakistan happy
 pakistan main china ne baari nivesh kiya he
 The China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is being built between the two countries at a huge cost of $ 46 billion
 iskaa makasad pakistan se uttar pashchimi kshetra shinjiyang tak guadar bandargah, railway or haive ke jariye tel or gas kii supplai karnaa he
 This corridor will go through Pakistan Occupied Kashmir, gilgit-baltistan and Balochistan
 guadar bandargah ko is tarah banaaya ja rahaa he taaki 19 million ton kaccha tel sidhaa china bheja ja sake
 But China cannot say anything directly to India on this issue
 kyonki honkong masalaa bhi uske liye kashmir se kam nahin he
 Hong Kong was actually a colony of Britain and in 1997 Britain ceded Hong Kong to China with the condition of autonomy
 is dauraan honkong se apni raajnneetik, swatantraaa, saamaajik or kanoonee vyavastha ko kaayam rakhane kaa vaada kiya gaya tha
 For this reason, people living in Hong Kong do not consider themselves part of China and do not lag behind in criticizing the government
 lihaaja agar sidhe taur par china ne bharat ko kuch kaha to bharat bhi use honkong masale par gher saktaa he
 However, China and Pakistan's moves in the UNSC have failed
 ab dekhnaa yah hoga ki anuchhed 370 ko hataae jane ke dard ke karaah rahaa pakistan ab kiske aage gidgidaata he

 i request you to read Hindi, buy Hindi books
 kyonki yadi aap hindi kii kitaaben kharidenge to hindi ke prakaashak badhenge
 "ashutosh said," a dream seen in one's own language is far more beneficial than the reality found in another's language
 to yadi ham or aap apni bhashaa to thodaa rutaba denge to paaenge ki sangraahak nahin srujak ho gaye hai
 "in a conversation with senior journalist Shweta Singh till date, Ashutosh also spoke on his recent best seller book
 seshan kii shuruyaat unhone apni kitaab ke vyangy 'chitt or vitt' se kii
 During the satirical reading, he said, "if someone wants to make a place in the mind, then get his finances stuck
 chitt ke sambandh chalem na chalem, lekin vitt ke jarur chalate hai
 The mind is inhabited by finance
 november kaa maheenaa vitt ke lihaaj se koi nahin bhul saktaa

 agar meri taraf se koi aadesh he to uski copy media main jari kyon nahin karte
 The most interesting twist in this whole incident came when senior BJP leaders came to the rescue of Nitish
 is bich mukhyamantri jeethanram maanjhi ne is maamle main sibiai jaanch se inkaar kar diya he
 Manjhi said that husbands demand a CBI probe into wife's quarrel ?, Bihar's agency is competent
 philhal is maamle main kai sawaal ansulajhe hai jiskaa jawaab to koi nahin de rahaa he
 On the contrary, politicians are definitely busy hunting many birds with one stone

 ''mamchoti bacchiyonke rape kii mook darshak nahin ban sakati
 His blood-soaked screams don't let me sleep
 '' dilli mahila ayog kii adhyaksh swati maliwal ne aathven din bhi apni jid nahin chodi unhone apana anshan nahin todaa
 In a trembling and slow voice, Swati Maliwal repeats the resolution again
 ve ant main bas itnaa kahati hai, 'ab or nahin
 On 20 April, when the news came that the Center in its letter submitted to the Supreme Court said that the process of amending the POSCO Act to provide maximum punishment of hanging in cases of rape of 0-12 years old children, started Has been given
 ' to dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne swati maliwal ko badhai dete hue twit kiya, badhai ho swati jai hind
 Now you should end the fast
 ab ham sabko milakar kaam karnaa chahie taaki ye kanoon asardaar dhang se kaam kar saken
 And we will keep working on the remaining demands
 lekin swati ne is baar bhi anshan todane kii dilli ke mukhyamantri kii salaah nahin maani
 But Swati is adamant that she will not go on hunger strike until all her demands are met
 ve kahati hai ab sthiti' du or daai' yani karo yaa maro kii he
 If people believe that people are coming to the hunger strike daily for eight days, then instead of ending the fast, this news has encouraged Swati Maliwal to continue the fight
 swati ne saatven din kaha bhi tha, 'agar narendra modi ziddee hai to main bhi ziddee hum
 i will not move here unless my demands are met
 ' swati 7 or 8 april ko vil chair se mahatma gandhi kii samadhi tak gayi
 Seeing him on the whill chair, people also guessed that Swati is getting weaker
 lekin jab unke swasthya ke bare main vahaan maujuud ek walintier se poocha gaay to usne dow
 Showing the prescriptions of Atul Gupta, he said that his reason may have fallen but his health is absolutely right
 ve anshan ko jari rakh sakati hai
 Meanwhile, Swati weighs 67
 2 kigra
 Reduced from 62 kg
 ho gaya he
 Hundreds of people are reaching his fast daily
 auraten, ladkiyaan or bacchiyon ke haathon main balaatkaar karne waalon ko faansee dene ke paksh main shlogan likhe poster hai
 But in the crowd of these posters, most posters are taunting the slogan 'beti Bachao, Beti Padhao' of the BJP government
 jaise ek poster main likhaa he, ''khud pard lengi betiyaan nahin jarurat bataane kii, jarurat he unke liye surakshit samaaj banane kii
 "almost the same poster appeared in the hands of a girl, it was written," Only daughter will survive rape; only daughter will study "
 anshan sthal samta ghat main maujuud nadira kahati hai, 'jab swati hamaare bacchon ke liye lard raheen hai to ham kya unka saath bhi nahin de sakate
 "juhi, who is on a hunger strike, says angrily," Swati Maliwal has been sitting on hunger for the eighth day
 par abhi bhi log gharon main baithe hai
 After all, what is Swati fighting for? Why are people not taking to the streets for their daughters? '' darasal juhi ne ye pratikriya us sawaal ke jawaab main di jisamen unase poocha gaya ki swati ke anshan se puri dilli kyon nahin adolit hoti
 The Congress marched a candle at the Delhi Gate only one night and thousands gathered, but why was not such a crowd gathering on the eighth day of the fast? But at present it does not seem that the chairperson of the Delhi Women's Commission will end the fast
 anshan todengi tab jab puri hongi ye maangenswati maliwal ne anshan todane ke liye kuch sharte rakhin hai
 Their first condition is to have more and more fast track courts in Delhi so that cases of rape with women and girls can be disposed of within six months
 duusari maang he, bacchiyon ke saath balaatkaar karne waalon ko chah maah ke bheetar faansee kii sajaa ho
 The third demand is to complete the shortage of 66,000 police personnel in Delhi at the earliest

 unhone kaha, ‘stadimon ko puraa karne ke liye aayojan samiti yaa kalmari jimmedaar nahin hai
 Its full responsibility is from various agencies like SAI, DDA, PWD, CPWD

 He has shared his experience on Instagram
 40 days since i quit smoking 
 
 have started to eat like a pig and to counter that i swam a 100 lengths in 93 minutes in a 30 metre pool
 
 And when i smoked , i ate less , was much fatter, and could swim equivalent of a km in 40 minute and only sometime push it to more than that
 Now its easier to swim 90 mts everyday
 i can feel my breath, i dont choke, i dont cough all the time , i don’t wake up with a heavy head and its only forty days
 But yes sometime the temptation to pick it back up does surface especially when everyone around us is smoking
 Me , the chainsmoker for 25 years , the one who made “no smoking”
 
 is forced to admit that life is so much better without picking a cigarette

 And when i smoked cigarettes, i used to eat very little food and was fat
 itani hi duuri tak ek kilometre tairne main 40 minute lag jate the
 Now it has become easier to swim 90 meters daily

 have started to eat like a pig and to counter that i swam a 100 lengths in 93 minutes in a 30 metre pool
 
 And when i smoked , i ate less , was much fatter, and could swim equivalent of a km in 40 minute and only sometime push it to more than that
 Now its easier to swim 90 mts everyday
 i can feel my breath, i dont choke, i dont cough all the time , i don’t wake up with a heavy head and its only forty days
 But yes sometime the temptation to pick it back up does surface especially when everyone around us is smoking
 Me , the chainsmoker for 25 years , the one who made “no smoking”
 
 is forced to admit that life is so much better without picking a cigarette
