 Akshay's official entry into electoral politics was sealed with the announcement of 55 candidates for the upcoming Lok Sabha elections on Friday

 Firozabad, known worldwide for the manufacture of bangles, has been a traditional parliamentary seat of the SP and Yadav families for years
 pichley loksabhaa chunaav main akhilesh yadav ne yahaan se chunaav jeeta tha lekin kannauj se bhi jeet darj karne ke kaaran unhone yah seat chhod di thi
 In the subsequent by-elections, SP had fielded Akhilesh's wife Dimple from here, but lost to Congress candidate Raj Babbar by a huge margin
 sapa ke ek varisht netaa ne kaha ki, "party netritv ab apni is paramparaagat seat par phir se kabja chahta he
 That is why Akshay, a member of the family, has been made a candidate from here
 " Akshay may not have been in active politics yet, but he took up the entire campaigning of his Tau Mulayam, who contested from Mainpuri in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections
 iske alaava firozabad seat par hue up chunaav ke dauraan unhone bhabhi dimpal ke chunaav prabandhan main bhi mahatvapurn jimmedaari nibhaai thi

 Ram Manohar Lohia, who was himself a staunch opponent of dynastic politics
 samaajawaadee party ke pradesh pravaktaa rajendra choudhary kehete hai, "party hameshaa yogya ummidavaar ko tikat detii he
 Anyway, whatever member of the Mulayam Singh Yadav family has come to politics, the people have proved it to be baseless by raising it and promoting familyism
 " Akshay is the seventh member of the most powerful Yadav family of Uttar Pradesh politics to have entered active politics
 akshay yadav sapa mukhiya mulaayam singh ke bhattije or party ke rashtriya mahasachiv ram gopal yadav ke putr hai

 The government is not listening to you, it is weakness, not power
 is sarkaar main vah himmat nahin he ki aapaki baat sune

 Will take it to the poor
 bataa den ki isse pehle rahul gandhi ne maharashtra ke pune main ek chaatr dwaara puche gaye sawaal par bhi yahi jawaab diya tha
 In the rally, Rahul Gandhi has once again targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi raising the issue of demonetisation, GST, employment and farmers
 rahul gandhi ne kaha ki bijepi ne kisaanon ke liye kuch nahin kiya
 When the Congress Party comes to power, we will put food processing factories on the farmers' fields, in which the farmer will be able to send his goods directly and will also provide storage facilities so that the farmer gets maximum benefit
 congress party kisaan ko uski fasal kaa sahi mulya bhi dilaane ke liye patibaddh he
 Rahul Gandhi said that the economy is stagnant in the Modi government, people are not getting employment
 garibon ko lone nahin miltaa he
 The youth wants employment, but does not get a loan from the bank
 rahul ne kaha ki aisa nahin he ki paisa nahin he
 It takes 35 thousand crore rupees a year to run 'MNREGA'
 matlab aap 35 hajaar karod lagaakar karodon logon ko rojgaar de sakate hai
 But Nirav Modi stole 35 thousand crores
 vijay maalya, mehul chaukasee ye sab yahi kar rahe hai
 If the Congress party comes, then this money which is going to these 15-20 people, will put that money directly in your bank account

 In this direction, the BJP has launched all the signs

 This afternoon, when the television of the capital Delhi was looking for a solution for itself in the Vedic period, there was news of the government in Delhi amid reports of drought
 jab hamaare sahyogi akhilesh sharma ne khabar khandit kar di yani brake kar di ki dilli main bijepi sarkaar banane kii taiyaari kar rahi he
 The party is waiting for the return of Prime Minister Narendra Modi on a foreign tour
 akhilesh ne yah bhi sanketon ke sahare suchit kiya ki jagadish mukhi kaa naam mukhyamantri kii daud main aage najar aa rahaa he
 Prof Jagdish Mukhi is one of the old leaders of Delhi
 janakapuri vidhansabha se saat baar se vidhayak hai or purv vittamantri sahit vipaksh ke netaa bhi rah chuke hai
 Politics must often be seen in its irony
 ve bhi kya din the jab shila dikshit or arvind kejariwal ke mukaable bijepi ke postaron main vijay goyal vijeta kii tarah chhaae hue the
 But, with the coming of elections, Vijay Goyal changed and Harshvardhan came
 nateeja aayaa to harshavardhan sahab aakar bhi manzil par pahunchane se rah gaye
 Vijay Goel reached the Rajya Sabha and Dr
 Harshvardhan won the Lok Sabha

 In the meantime, Kiran Bedi's name also started as an honest leader

 But, Satish Upadhyay came to the post of BJP President

 Now the name of Prof Jagdish Mukhi has come
 pataa nahin pehle waalon kaa naam bhi aayega yaa nahin
 Although the BJP did not get the power of Delhi, the change of power in the BJP was strong
 aam aadmi party ke anusaar bijepi uske vidhayakon ko kharidne main lagi he
 The Congress or no Congress MLA has made such allegations that the BJP wants to buy them or their mlas
 jis dilli main tamaato saath rupee kilo ho us dilli main vidhayakon ke liye khareednaa kriya kaa prayog nahin karnaa chahie
 So is the BJP really going to claim to form a new government? vidambnaa vipaksh ke kheme main bhi kam nahin rahi
 After Sheila Dixit became the Governor of Kerala, Narendra Modi became the Prime Minister and demanded his resignation
 congress dilli main loksabhaa kii saaton seat haar gai or desh bhar main 44 hi jeet saki
 Arvind Kejriwal, who resigned on 14 February, apologized till 21 May that leaving the government was a big mistake
 aap ko dilli main loksabhaa kii ek bhi seat nahin mili magar chaar saansad mili
 The AAP had recommended dissolution of the assembly
 lekin, centre sarkaar ne raashtrapati shashan laga diya
 The Aam Aadmi Party went against this to the Supreme Court, which has been sent by the court to the Constitution Bench, where the hearing will be held on 4 August
 samvidhan peeth ko yah tay karnaa he ki kya wo up rajyapal yaa rashtpati ko nirdeshit kar sakati he ki dilli main chunaav karaaye jaayen
 But before sending it to the Constitution Bench at a hearing, the court had made a comment that anything can happen in politics
 shuru main congress ne bijepi ko baahar rakhane ke liye aap kaa samarthan kiya
 If you become their biggest enemy, then you can combine with BJP to keep AAP out
 vaise bhi dilli vidhansabha main donon ne milakar janalokapal bill ko pesh nahin hone diya tha
 Nothing seems impossible from the incident that took place in the assembly
 yahaan tak ki congress or bijepi bhi kisi tarah milakar sarkaar bana sakate hai
 Not literally, but this comment looks like a prediction
 congress samarthan bhale na kare magar toote taron kii tarah uske vidhayak bijepi kii sarkaar banavaa sakate hai
 There was another matter in the context of this hearing
 arvind kejariwal ne up-rajyapal ko likh diya ki ek haftaa tak vidhansabha bhang na karen jabaki adaalat main yachika lagaai thi ki bhang ho
 There are also heads of morality in coin and tale
 9 disambar 2013 ko doctor harshavardhan kaa bayaan he ki agar duusari koi party sarkaar banane ke liye taiyaar nahin he to na hi ham unhen pareshaan karenge na hi ham kharid farokht karenge
 So why is BJP now saying that if the Lieutenant Governor is called then we will see
 aakhir loksabhaa main prachand bahumat vaali bijepi dilli main chunaav kii baat kyon nahin karti he
 Somewhere the horse-trading is not being launched under the new name like toothpaste

 The number becomes 31 from an independent and an MLA expelled from you
 dalbadal kanoon se bachane ke liye congress ke aath main se chah ko tootna hoga
 This is how the BJP government is formed
 sutara kehete hai ki bijepi aap ke vidhayakon se sampark main nahin he
 This is amazing point information
 aap ke vidhayakon ke sampark main nahin he to kya yah mana jaae ki congress ke vidhayakon ke sampark main hai
 Anyway congress kah rahi he ki uske vidhayak nahin tut rahe hai
 Now our colleague Ravish Ranjan Shukla has brought another angle in this game
 congress ke chah vidhayak ramvir singh vidhudi ke sampark main hai
 Vidhuri ji wants to become CM himself by killing part of Mukhi ji
 chah vidhayakon ke zariye bijepi netritv par dabaav daal rahe hai
 Somewhere, Jagdambika Pal in Delhi may not be overpowered when Jagdambika Pal became CM for a day in 1998

 This was the reason they had to fight against us

 unhone kaha, mujhe assi kaa dashak yaad aa rahaa he jab ham bharat ke khilaaf jeet rahe the
 We always felt that most of his players are not playing as a unit and they are only interested in securing their place for the next match by scoring 30 or 40 runs
 yahi vajah thi hamaare khilaaf unhen sangharsh karnaa padataa he
 The comments malik ne kaha, durbhaagya se aaj ham pakistan cricket main bhi aisi sthiti kaa saamana kar rahe hai
 i have noticed that most of our players are showing interest in securing their place for the next match by scoring a few runs
 unhone kaha, mujhe nahin lagata ki hamaare khilaadi ikai ke taur par pradarshan kar rahe hai
 Cricket is a team game and you can win by the efforts of all 11 players

 We are not playing as a unit and i do not think we will be able to win as a team

 Often parents keep commenting on the eating and drinking habits of the children, but these things are not liked by the children
 iske peeche abhibhavakon kii manshaa ko acchhee aadaton ko badhaava dena hi hota he par bachche ise sakaaratmak tareeke se nahin lete hai
 It is important for children to eat healthy, but at the same time it is very important that how do parents tell these things to children
 abhibhavakon kobacchon ke saath kabhi duusare bacchon kii tulana nahin kerani chahie
 Parents should never talk about showing food to their siblings or tell children about healthy eating
 1
 Children should never say that if your siblings or friends are eating, what is the problem in eating them? isse behatar he ki bacchon ko pyaar se kahen, 'mujhe pataa he ki ye tumhen khaane main bahut acha nahin lag rahaa he, lekin kuch bhi nayaa khaanaa acha lagane ke liye thodaa vakt lagata he or tum khaaoge tabhi iskaa swaad jaan paaoge
 '2
 bacchon ko aise kabhi na kahen ki tum chun-chun kar khate ho
 Explain to them lovingly and understand the flavors of food, start a little bit, you will like it
 unki ek hi pasand ke khaane ko lekar agar aap baar-baar kahenge to bacchon ko ye bilkul pasand nahin aayega

 dilli kii aam aadmi party sarkaar ne metro or ditisi-cluster bason main mahilaon ko muft safar dene kaa elaan kiya he
 Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has said that the scheme will be implemented in the next 2-3 months
 haalanki, kejariwal sarkaar ke is faisle main kya centre sarkaar aade nahin aegi, ise lekar bhi sawaal khadey ho rahe hai
 There are many other aspects as well, the picture of which is not clear yet
 ab tak arvind kejariwal shikaayat karte rahe hai ki unki sarkaar jo bhi janakalyaan ke faisle leti he, centre kii modi sarkaar uparajyapal ke jariye aise faislon main roda atka detii he
 In such a situation, when Kejriwal announced free travel in the metro and buses, he was also asked this question
 is par kejariwal ne bataaya ki muft yatra yojana main sarkaar sabsidi kaa paisa apane khajaane se degi, aise main iske liye centre kii parmishan kii jarurat nahin he
 However, apart from this, there are many such questions which are yet to be answered
 sabase bada sawaal ye he ki mahilaon ko free safar kii yah chhot kis rup main di jaaegi
 For example, will a separate entry be arranged for them at metro stations or will a smart card or token be issued
 abhi yah bhi spasht nahin he ki sabsidi kaa paisa labhaarthiyon ko diya jayega yaa dilli metro ko iskaa bhugtan hoga
 At the same time, if a separate card is issued to the beneficiary woman, then no one other than the eligible woman can use that card, what will be the arrangement for this
 yaa phir mahilaon ke liye steshnon par alag se entry or agsit get banaae jaaenge
 Experts say that free travel in buses will not be such a big challenge for the government, but maintaining this system in the metro is a big challenge
 yah bhi kaha ja rahaa he ki smart card yaa token ke jariye free safar kii suvidha di jaati he to uske liye metro kiraaya collection ke tareekon main badlaav karne padenge
 In such a situation, if there is any change in the metro rules, then the approval of the Central Government may be required for that
 dilli ke baahar kii mahilaon ko bhi milegaa phayda?saath hi ye sawaal bhi charchaa ke centre main he ki kya yah suvidha sirf dilli kii mahilaon ke liye hogi yaa ensiaar or duusare ilaakon se har roj dilli metro main safar karne vaali mahilaon ko bhi iskaa laabh milegaa
 This question is also important because Delhi Chief Minister Kejriwal was not invited to the inauguration of the new metro line started in Noida and UP CM Yogi Adityanath became part of the inauguration ceremony as the question was of the governments' stake
 is tarah ke tamaam sawaal hai jin par abhi sthiti spasht honi baaki he
 The government is also taking feedback from the public on this plan
 dipti siem manish sisodiya ne mangalvaar ko khud bason main safar par nikalne kaa plan banaaya he, jisamen wo muft safar par janata kii raay lenge
 However, how and when this scheme gets implemented is now under everyone's watch

 'let me tell you that the new Motor Vehicle Act came into force from September 1
 iske tahat yatayaat ke niyamon kaa ulanghan karne par baari jurmaana lagane kaa praavdhaan kiya gaya he
 In the new Motor Vehicle Act, the amount of challan has been increased by 10 times as compared to earlier
 iske chalate kaaphi vivaad bhi ho rahaa he
 Many times the amount of challan is so much that people are surprised

 These soulful words of Chidambaram cannot become the second seed of the emergence of the young Turks and women of India, who have been increasingly disillusioned since the long journey of the country since 1950

 haalanki ab tak sensorship hi chal rahi he

 Well-known political psychologist Ashish Nandy says that both the Congress and the BJP have often preferred to adopt easy solutions to political or administrative failure, especially when they face the danger of losing a significant supporting class
 yahaan tak ki bhartiya udaarvaad ke guru jawahar laal nehru ne bhi 1950 ke dashak kii shuruyaat main romesh thapar kii kakvaunist samarthak patrika crossrods par pratibandh kaa aadesh diya tha—thapar kii abhivyakti kii swatantraaa ke adhikaar kaa bachaav kisi or ne nahin, jansangh ke netaa shyama prasad mukherjee ne kiya tha—or jab supreme court ne pradhanmantri ke aadesh ko khaarij kar diya, to nehru ne patrika ko bazaar main aane se rokane ke liye alag hi tarika apana liya tha
 Certainly by refusing to stand in favor of an old divorced Muslim woman named Nehru's grandson Rajiv Gandhi Shahbano and allowing the government to ban Salman Rushdie's book Satanic Verses — a ban that continues to this day — unintentionally In a manner, the Congress was taken towards the right

 Although it was strongly opposed by the permanent officers, the unilateral support of the people on this decision of the government was shocking
 yah samarthan us tathy ko darshata he ki log prashasan main parivartan ko utsuk hai
 But is the government really keen on it? This question is arising in the mind that neither a single word of any political party is read in the manifesto about the improvement of administration, nor even a single word is heard in the speech of any leader
 aakhir aisa kyon he?iskaa kuch uttar hamen rajyon evam kendra ke chunavi paridrishy main mil jaataa he
 The number of high-level administrative officers in the Lok Sabha and Assembly elections is constantly increasing
 yah sankhya keval unki nahin he, jo yaa to ritair ho gaye hai, yaa ritair hue abhi kuch hi vakt gujara he

 Rather, it is constantly being encouraged by political parties

 vaise to pichley parinaamon ke swaroop bhi is pariksha pranali ke vyaavhaarik samarthy par lagaataar prashn chihn lagaate aa rahe the, lekin is baar kuch zyada hi had ho gai
 Two things of this result started to cause concern
 pehali yah ki safal hone vaale pratiyogiyon main jise bhi dekho, vah ejeeniyar he
 These engineers are also from iits, and there are those who are coming to this annual package of ten lakh rupees, except for the annual package of Rs
 yani ki yah bhartiya prashasnic seva kii jagah kramash: ejeeniyar prashasnic seva banati ja rahi he
 Its second concern is already connected
 chunki ejiniyaron kaa is par aadhipaty hota ja rahaa he, isliye yah pariksha lagbhag-lagbhag angrejimay ho gai he
 Competitors with Hindi and other Indian languages are disappearing
 nishchit rup se aage chalakar inkaa kaaphi nakaaratmak prabhaav prashasan main dekhne ko milegaa
 Politicians are not going to make a difference, but people will have to
 isliye ab yah aprihaary ho gaya he ki raajnneeti evam chunaav main sudhaar ke saath-saath prashasan main bhi sudhaar kii baat jor-shor se uthaai jaae

 Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi is using poems and shero-shayari from Hindi literature and Urdu language to attack PM Modi nowadays, sometimes he was attacked by Jai Prakash Narayan and Arif Mohammad Khan of his grandmother Indira Gandhi and her father Rajiv Gandhi Used to protest
 ye kavitaayen or shero-shaayari us daur ke raajnneetik itihaas kaa hissaa he
 It may be that Priyanka does not know this
 mumkin he ki unki bhashaa koi or likh rahaa ho
 In the Pratapgarh district of UP, where PM Modi had called Rajiv Gandhi corrupt, today, Priyanka Gandhi attacked him with the famous Shero of Urdu Adab
 priyanka ne shahaab jaafaree kaa ek sher padhaa ki-''tu idhar-udhar kii na baat kar Tell me why the convoy was robbed? main bataaun ki kafila kyon lutaa? Dealing with your loved ones mujhe rahajanon se gilaa nahin, The question on your Rehbari is "" In the old times, there were convoys of traders in the Arabian desert
 anjaan registani raaston pe rahajan unheen lut lete the
 Therefore, with each convoy, there was also a Rahbar, who showed the right path
 '' priyanka ke is sher kaa matlab he ki piem modi jo rasta dikhaane vaale rahabar ke role main the, unhone rahajanon se mil desh kaa kafila lutwa diya
 But perhaps Priyanka would not know that her father Rajiv Gandhi overturned the Supreme Court's decision to give alimony to a divorced Muslim woman, Shehbano
 tab unke cabinet ke mantri aarif mohammad khan ne sansad main unke pita rajeev gandhi ke khilaaf apane bhashaa main yahi sher pard ke istipha de diya tha
 Priyanka Gandhi had just read a few lines of the poem 'krishna's Warning' from the poem 'rashmirathi' of the nation poet Ramdhari Singh Dinkar at his rally in Ambala on 7 May
 kavita kaa prasang ye he ki mahabharat ke samay bhagwaan krishna jab kauravon ko samajhane jate hai ki yuddh na karen to ve duryodhana se bhagwaan krishna ko baandh lene ko kehete hai
 Priyanka told this in the rally that Ramdhari Singh Dinkar has mentioned that - "when there is an umbrella on the destroyer Manuj, pehle vivek mar jaataa he
 Hari shouted fiercely, dagamag-dagamag diggaj dole, God wrathfully said- ‘zanjeer badha kar saadh mujhe, Yes, yes Duryodhana! Dam i would be interesting to know that, on 25 June 1975, Jai Prakash Narayan from Delhi's Ramlila Maidan against Priyanka's grandmother Indira Gandhi, the second lines of Dinkar's same 'krishna Warning' to declare a war of complete revolution

 aipal kaa iljaam rahaa he ki samsung electronics ne iphone kaa dizin copy kiya he or is vajah se samsung ko penalty ke taur par paise bhi dene pade hai
 However, on what terms this patent dispute of Apple and Samsung has been settled, it is not clear yet
 gauratlab he ki turm of setlement america district court for nordarn district of california main kiya gaya
 Let me tell you that the patent war started in 2011 by copying the design of iphone
 shuruyaat main court ne aipal ke paksh main paisaal sunaate hue samsung se 1 billian dollar kaa jurmaana maanga
 However, this case did not end here
 darasal aipal kaa aarope rahaa he ki samsung ne aipal ke basic function churaae hai
 For example tap to zoom, home screen app grid and layout
 asal mudda ye tha ki samsung ne shuruaati dinon main aipal ke dizin or yujar interphes ko copy karke lokapriyata hasil kii he or yahi aarope aipal kaa rahaa he
 It has been interesting that the jury also admitted that Samsung has done this, that Apple's accusation is true
 haal hi main samsung ko 539 million dollar dekar is maamle ko settle kare kii baat kii gai
 After this, Samsung again appealed
 lekin donon companiyaan ab agali sunwaayee se pehle hi is agreement par pahunch gaye hai ki ab is maamle ko khatm karne kaa samay aa gaya he
 Apple has not told the media about the terms for settling the case
 haalanki aipal ne ye kaha he ki dizin ko lekar company calf gambhir rahati he or yah cese hameshaa se paison se badhkar he
 There is no statement from Samsung on this matter so far
 2016 ke aakhir main ek trial main haar ke baad samsung electronics ne america supreme court main apil kii thi or court ne samsung kii us daleel ko kharij nahin kiya jisamen samsung ne kaha ki patent kaa ulanghan karne vaale ko churaae hue dizin se kamaaye gaye saare paise nahin die jane chahie, kyonki us dizin kaa ek hissaa hi tha
 Apple's advantage in the battle of this patent is believed to be
 lekin dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki aakhir koun se wo terms hai jinpar donon companiyon ne is patent battle ko viraam dene kaa nirnay liya he

 In view of bjp's blistering victory in the recently concluded Uttar Pradesh elections, both these parties have insisted on forming a grand alliance
 janata dal united ke pravaktaa sanjay singh ne kaha ki jab tak desh ke tamaam raajnneetik dal bhaajapa ko haraane ke liye ek manch par nahin aate hai tab tak pradhanmantri modi ko haraana sambhav nahin he
 Sanjay Singh said that if Mayawati had joined hands with the Congress and Samajwadi Party alliance in Uttar Pradesh, then the picture there would be something else
 congress party, jisane uttar pradesh chunaavon main ab tak kii sabase buree paraajay dekhi he, usne bhi rani ke liye maha gathbandhan banane kii baat kahi
 Senior Congress leader Mani Shankar Iyer said that the Congress party is weak in many states and where it has formed an alliance, it has performed better
 manishankar ayyar ne is baat par bhi jor diya ki congress party ko samajhnaa chahie ki unki sthiti 1968 jaisi majboot nahin he or aise main 2019 ko lekar maha gathbandhan bananaa behad jaruri he
 In the Rashtriya Janata Dal too, the reason for the bjp's victory in Uttar Pradesh was not the formation of the Grand Alliance
 purv mukhyamantri rabari devi ne kaha ki agar uttar pradesh main mahagathbandhan banataa to vahaan kaa parinaam kuch or hota
 However, if a grand alliance is formed in 2019 to defeat Prime Minister Modi, then the JDU has made it clear that Chief Minister Nitish Kumar can be the face of the Grand Alliance and the strongest Prime Minister to contest Modi

 is mudde par centre sarkaar ke do ahm mantriyon main matbhed barqaraar hai
 Tribal Affairs Minister Kishore Chandra Dev continues to stand by his point
 unka maananaa he ki june ke aakiri hafte main basuguda main hua encounter galat tha or isamen zyaadaatar behunah maare gaye
 According to him, he still persists on the questions he has raised regarding this encounter
 ' The case is under judicial investigation
 haalanki iske pehle hi grih mantri pi chidambaram siarpief kii karrwai kaa samarthan kar chuke hai
 Even now he is saying so much that if someone is killed innocent then he is sorry for this
 lekin kishor chandra dev ne buudhvaar ko hi kaha ki maare gaye 19 logon main kam se kam 17 bekasoor naagarik maare gaye jo nihathe the or sirf dhoti−baniyaan main the
 On Thursday too, Kishore Chandra Dev admitted that he is not satisfied with the cleanliness of the Home Minister regarding the encounter
 unhone kaha, 'chidambaram paas jo tathy hai uske aadhaar par unhone bayaan diya


 mere paas jo tathy the uske aadhaar par maine apni baat kahi

 There are differences between the two important ministers of the central government on this issue
 janajaatiy maamalon ke mantri kishorchandra dev apni baat par kaayam hai
 They believe that the encounter in Basuguda in the last week of June was wrong and that most of the deaths were lost
 unke mutabik is incounter ko lekar jo sawaal unhone uthaae hai unpar vah aaj bhi kaayam hai
 ' is maamle kii nyaayik jaanch ho rahi he
 However, Home Minister p Chidambaram has already supported the CRPF action
 ab bhi vah itnaa bhar kah rahe hai ki agar koi begunaah maaraa gaya to iske liye unhen khed he
 But Kishore Chandra Dev said on Wednesday that out of the 19 killed, at least 17 innocent civilians were killed who were unarmed and were only in dhoti-vest
 guuruuvaar ko bhi kishorchandra dev ne mana ki incounter ko lekar grih mantri kii safai se vah santusht nahin hai

 Vishwa Hindu Parishad has started a program in the name of removing untouchability with Dalits 'hindu Family Friend'
 lekin yah kaarykram unke saamaajik utthan se zyadadharm parivartan or ghar vaapasijaise kaaryakramon se jod dekha ja rahaa he
 In fact, two political cases of untouchability came to the spotlight last year
 farvari, 2014 main narendra modi or sitambar, 2014 main jithan ram maanjhi ne bataaya ki kis tarah ve log bhi chuaachhut ke shikaar hote rahe hai
 Modi was then the chief minister of Gujarat and bjp's prime ministerial candidate, while Jeetan Ram Manjhi was the chief minister of Bihar
 kochi main ek dalit forum ke kaarykram main modi ne kaha, 'main aaj bhi antchebility kaa shikaar hota rahaa hum
 "then he also hoped for a better future," i want to say with great confidence whatever the ups and downs in the 60 years of independence
 
 
 jiskaa bhi prabhaav rahaa ho
 
 
 But keep writing my words for ten years
 
 
 hindustan main dalit, peedit shoshit pichde ati pichde
 
 
 This is going to go on
 'patna main ek kaarykram main maanjhi ne bataaya ki chunaav prachaar ke dauraan madhubani ke jis mandir main unhone puja-archana kii, vahaan unke jane ke baad logon ne murti or mandir parisar kii dhulaai kii
 According to Manjhi, the house where he stayed for some time was also washed
 chuaachhut ke khilaaf viechpi kaa abhiyaanrashtriya swayamsevak sangh (aresas) ke baad ab vishwa hindu parishad (viechpi) ne bhi chuaachhut ke khilaaf muhim chalaane kaa faisla kiya he
 The VHP campaign has been named - 'hindu family friend'
 is yojana ke tahat savarna log daliton ke saath khaanaa khaaenge or uske baad uski tasviren soshal media par daali jaaengi
 What is the Hindu family friend scheme? Let's know - Responsibility of elders 1
 is yojana ke tahat har savarna parivaar ek dalit parivaar se maitri sambandh banaaenge
 Will come to each other's house
 sukh-dukh kii ghadi main donon parivaar saath dikhaai denge
 2
 aise do parivaar ek saath baithkar ghar main khaanaa khaaenge, na ki kisi hotel main jaakar yaa kisi dhabas par
 When the two families go out for a walk, they will take homemade food and eat it together
 bacchon kii jimmedaarijab donon parivaar saath baithkar khaanaa kha rahe honge to ghar ke bachche yaa kishor jo bhi saath main hon, ve unki tasviir lenge
 After that they have to share this picture on whatsapp, Facebook
 bataate hai ki iske liye viechpi ke kaaryakarta gaanv-gaanv pahunchakar jaateey samudaayon ke saath meeting karenge or un sabko paraspar hindu ekta banane kaa sandesh denge
 It is very difficult, there are many obstacles in this way of making family friends of Dagar Panghat
 shaharon kii baat ab or he lekin gaanvon main halaat ab bhi nahin badale hai
 1
 maan lete hai ki hindu samaaj ke savarna tabake ke log dalit parivaar ke logon se dosti kar lenge
 After all, what can be a good thing? jahaan chuaachhut vyaapt he, vahaan kya viechpi kaaryakarta logon ko ye baat samajha paaenge? kya viechpi kaa hindu samaaj par itnaa asar he ki uski baat log maan lenge? or agar log nahin maane to kya viechpi kaaryakarta balpurvak unase ye kaam karaayenge?2
 The upper castes and dalits in the cities can be neighbors
 agal-bagal flats main aise log mil jaaenge
 But in many villages, the settlement of Dalits has been set aside
 dalit parivaar ke log savarnon ke yahaan aate hai or khaanaa khate hai
 They are fed food on the occasion of marriage but in the end
 agar daliton ke yahaan shaadi hoti he to savarna logon main se kuch aise jarur hai jo unke yahaan aashirwad dene jate hai
 But how many of them eat there too? What miracle would VHP do to eradicate these discrimination? 3
 'hindu parivaar mitra' yojana main saath khaane kaa photo soshal media par daalane kii vyavastha di jaaegi
 This will surely send a natural message that everyone is eating together, but will the same thing really be publicized? Will the food eaters not say loudly that they did it? yani khaane ke baad bhi bataaenge ki jinke saath unhone khaanaa khaaya ve dalit hai
 4
 mitrataa swaabhaavik taur par hoti he
 Because of studying together, being a neighbor or for some other reason
 kya kisi abhiyaan ke tahat mitrataa ho sakati he
 This is possible only when people get something in return or have some selfishness
 vyavsaayik sambandhon ke chalate pariwaron main mitrataa ho jaati he
 But often such friendship ends even if there is no business relationship
 iske liye viechpi kya upaay karne vaali he
 Will the VHP be given any reward for this? During the Peshwa rule, the untouchables were not allowed to walk on the road on which a Savarna Hindu is walking
 achhuton ko apni kalai main yaa gale main kaala dhaagaa baandhne ko kaha jaataa tha, taaki savarna inhen galati se kahin chhu na len
 This social division is considered to be the biggest cause of communal partition
 barason se takreeban sabhi siyaasi dalon kii raajnneeti isi saamaajik or sampradayik bantwaare ke boote chalati rahi he
 When Rahul Gandhi was eating food at the house of the Dalits, he was criticized that he was pretending
 mayawati se lekar baba ramdev tak sabhi ne jane kya kya na kaha
 However, later there were also reports that Rahul never looked at him again
 ab aresas or phir viechpi ne iske liye abhiyaan chalaane kaa faisla kiya he
 Recently the RSS decided to move forward on the concept of 'a well, a temple and a cremation ground' for all Hindus
 sangh ko samaj aa gaya he ki hindu samaaj ke andar bhedbhaav ko khatm kiye bagaiyr use ekajute nahin kiya ja saktaa
 If VHP leader Praveen Togadia gets a little success in this campaign, then surely people will forget his poisonous speeches and remember him in the same way as Swami Dayanand Saraswati and Mahatma Gandhi

 raashtrapati maitreepala sirisena kii ore se ranil vikramsinghe ko hataaya janaa or mahinda rajpakshe ko pradhanmantri banaae jane kii ghatana ko kaaphi gambhirtha se dekha ja rahaa he
 Very soon the session of the Sri Lankan Parliament will be convened and voting will be held for the confidence vote
 haalanki isaki taarikh abhi tay nahin hui he
 Amunagama spoke to 'india Today' on several issues
 prastut hai iske kuch khaas ansh
 Sri Lanka and Foreign Policy India and Sri Lanka share a very deep relationship
 videsh niti ke str par bharat or srilanka main kaaphi gahari dosti he
 There may be some differences but it will not affect the relationship
 srilanka main raajnneetik sankatsarc deshon main srilanka hi akelaa desh he jiskaa apane padosiyon se koi manmutav nahin he
 Even if it is, negotiations are going on with the neighboring countries
 saarc kshetra ke sabhi deshon ke liye srilanka ek miting point kii tarah kaam karata he
 When will the parliament session be called? Amunagama said, Parliament session will be called on November 14
 usase pehle 5 november ko bajet pesh kiya janaa he
 The President has the right to keep the Parliament adjourned for 2 months
 agar raashtrapati ko trust vot kaa dar hota to ve satr nahin bulaate or sansad band rakhte lekin unhone aisa nahin kiya
 India will get East Port? East Port is very important for Sri Lanka because it has the highest traffic and most ships for India operate from here
 bharat bhi apane port viksit kar rahaa he isliye hamen bhavishya ko dekhte hue apane port bhi banane honge
 Three parts of the East Port have been built
 baaki ke do hisse nirmaanadhin hai
 Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi has shown interest in making the western part of the East Port, while Sri Lanka will make the eastern part
 nishkasit pradhanmantri ranil vikramsinghe ke liye yah jaruri nahin tha ki ve kisi duusare desh main jaakar iske nirmaan kaa aashwaasan dete
 This is not the way to work
 port kaa nirmaan sansad tay karti he
 This was going on but there was no agreement with any country
 srilanka main china kaa paisabharat or china ko ek duusare ke khilaaf bhadakaane kii kai koshishen ho rahi hai
 Sri Lanka has to develop its own infrastructure
 iske liye ham international monetary fund or asian davalapment bank gaye
 Today's formula is that development countries should invest in their infrastructure first
 garibi se ubarne kaa yahi tarika he
 This requires money
 srilankai infrastracchar main puri tarah china kaa paisa nahin laga he
 Japan has more money than China
 srilanka ke ranneetik sambandhsrilanka kaa china ke saath aarthik sambandh he or bharat ke saath bhi majboot sambandh banane kii koshish he
 Sri Lanka's first priority has always been India
 ham khud ko kisi duusare desh ke ranneetik sambandh main nahin ghasita janaa chaahate
 No other country should interfere in the sovereignty of Sri Lanka
 bharat is baat kii kadra karata he, isliye use dhanyavad
 There may be some differences but our relationship is strong
 telugana se aae rujhaanon se saaf ho gaya he ki vahaan telugana raashtra samiti (tiares) kii sarkaar banegi
 Trends also suggest that TRS will form the government with a clear majority in Telangana
 chunaav purv congress jeet ke daawey kar rahi thi, lekin uski siten dahaai ank main bhi nahipahunch pain
 The same situation was also with BJP
 haalanki tiares or bijepi main aghoshit gathbandhan he
 k Chandrasekhar Rao is currently the Acting Chief Minister of Telangana, but he will become the Chief Minister again after the victory
 is chunaav ke saath yah bhi saaf ho gaya ki telugana main chandrashekhar raav kaa jalawaa barkaraar he
 Congress President Rahul Gandhi held several election rallies here and in many public meetings attacked against Rao and his government, but where the end result was tragic for the Congress, it was pleasant for TRS
 kesiar ke naam se mashhoor chandrashekhar raav kaa raajnneeti karne kaa tarika or logon se jude rahane kaa bhav inhen desh ke anya netaaon se kuch alag banaata he
 Telangana was formed after seceding from Andhra Pradesh in 2014, but in the last 5 years, KCR has done many things at the grassroots level that did not give other parties and leaders a chance to make a dent in the politics of KCR
 pruthak telugana ke liye tiares kaa gathan ahm kaaran mana jaataa he
 The TRS fought on the same principle that it had to secede from Andhra Pradesh for the betterment of the Telangana region and to find a meaningful solution to the discrimination against the people
 antat telugana andhra pradeshse alag hua or 2014 main kesiar mukhyamantri bane
 This was not the first time that KCR had received any major responsibility
 isse pehle 2004 main ve tiares ummidavaar ke taur par siddeepet vidhansabha or karimnagar loksabhaa kshetra se chune ja chuke the
 The 2004 parliamentary election was something special for KCR as TRS contested with Congress
 congress ne kesiar ko bharosa dilaayaa tha ki telugana ko pruthak rajya kaa darja diya jayega
 Apart from KCR, 5 TRS leaders were made mps in this election, but the then Congress government did not fulfill the promise made to KCR
 iske baad congress or tiares main dooriyaan badhati gayi
 BJP helped in creating Telangana and in this sense, the proximity between BJP and TRS is special
 ye nazdikiyaan 2018 ke vidhansabha chunaav main dekhe gaye jab bijepine khuleam elaan kiya ki siten ghatane kii surat main bijepi tiares ko madad karegi
 kcrkcr's decision to dissolve the Telangana Assembly and hold elections ahead of time was considered a masterstroke
 haalanki unki raah ko mushkil banane ke liye apratyaashit rup se congress or tidipi ne haath milakar mahagathbandhan banaaya or game changer hone kaa daawa kiya
 The Communist Party of India (CPI) and the newly formed party Telangana Jana Samiti also joined this alliance
 in chaar partiyon ke haath milaane se rajya main vipaksh kii daavedaari ko majbootee mili
 The survey also stated that the Congress has a good hold in the districts of South Telangana, so it may spoil the work of TRS but KCR reversed the stakes and is now going to form his government with a clear majority
 majboot iraadon vaale CM hai kesiarakesiar ko kaaphi pakke iraade vaala mukhyamantri mana jaataa he
 It is this different way of governance that he divided the 10 districts of the state into 31 districts in 2016, which he also promised during the campaign of a separate state

 Kutumb Survey of Kamal kcr-led Telangana government conducted a comprehensive family survey on October 29, 2014, in which 4 lakh government employees were employed and information was taken on the basis of 84 criteria
 isse rajya ko aisa bharosemand database mila jo apni pahunch or gaharaai ke maamlemen abhootpurv tha
 This data is more useful for policy formulation and schemes aimed at the common man
 telugana ne miseva centre sthapit kiya he
 It is a single entry and exit portal, through which services related to government to people or business to government are provided
 iske 5,073 centre 38 vibhaagon kii 600 sevaayen di jaati hai
 It is surprising to know that Telangana is at the forefront of the number of e-transactions per 1,000 people in the last four years
 prati hajaar 89,883 tranjaction ke saath rajya sheersh par he, iske baad andhra pradesh (82,868) or kerala (59,582) kaa sthanhai
 The backbone of this success is the Digital Telangana Program
 sabhi ko digital suvidha muhaiyaa karne ke liye telugana fibre grid (tii-fibre) bade paimaane par digital network infrastracchar taiyaar kar rahaa he jisase rajya ke 84 lakh pariwaron ko joda ja sake
 Along with the water pipe route laid under Mission Bhagirath, fiber optic cable will also be laid through T-fiber
 isse har parivaar ko peyajal muhaiyaa hoga
 On every front, the KKCR government reorganized 10 districts to 31 in 2016 to facilitate governance
 jameen kii registry ko saaf-suthra or apadet banane ke liye ek vyapak land survey kiya gaya, jisamen maujuuda vaid bhuswamiyon ko shaamil kiya gaya
 The benefit of this is being well received by the people of Telangana today

 2015 main reliyon se achaanak ubhare the hardiksaal 2015 main patidaar samaaj ke yuvaaon ko apane saath jodakar bade yuva netaa ke rup main ubhare hardik patel ne beete do saal main gujarat kii raajnneeti main acha-khaasaa dakhal diya he
 The Hardik rally held in 2015 had put many politicians to sleep
 berogari he bada muddagujrat ke mukhyamantri rahatenarendra modika puraa jor rajya kii aarthik raftaar badhaane kaa rahaa tha
 He invited investors from all over the world
 wibrant gujarat isi kaa prayaas he
 The effect of all these efforts of Modi was that the state was flooded with private education and professional institutions
 in sabake baavjood yah shikaayat rahi ki in sansthaanon se padhai kar nikle gujarat ke yuva phir bhi berozegaar hi rahe
 Skill development did not benefit the youth
 ejiniyaron ko bhi naukari nahinaal india council for technical ajukeshan ke data ke mutabik varsh 2015-16 main 20 pratishat se bhi kam ejineering main graduate yuvaaon ko gujarat main naukari mili he
 At the same time, out of 11190 graduates in computer science, only 3407 got jobs in campus placements
 iske alaava paanch pratishat se bhi kam civil ejineering main graduate yuvaaon ko campus sellection main jagah mili
 After Patidar, there was an eye on Kurmi and Gujjars
 In 2014, Narendra Modi left the state and came to power at the center
 modi kii gairmaujuudagi main rajya main 22 saal ke hardik patel patidaar samaaj ke bade yuva netaa banakar ubhare
 Hardik held several big rallies in the state, demanding reservation for the Patidar society
 patidaar samaaj ko obisi kaa darja dene kii yah maang puure rajya main jor pakadati gai
 Seeing the huge crowd of millions of youth in his rallies, Hardik tried to join Kurmi and Gujjars of other states as well
 isiilie bihar chunaav main bhi hardik ne vahaan kaa daura kiya tha
 Big leaders were blown away
 Sleephardik Patel held several big rallies in Gujarat in 2015
 in reliyon se soobe kii sarkaar tak dabaav main aa gai thi
 The trouble increased for the then Anandiben government when the Dalits also started the movement at the same time
 patidaaron kii maang ke chalate sitambar 2015 main saamaanya varg ke yuvaaon ke liye 1000 karod ke bajet vaali mukhyamantri yuva swaavlamban skim kaa paisa kam kar diya gaya
 In April 2016, while Hardik Patel was in jail, the Gujarat government issued an ordinance to provide 10 percent reservation to the Patidars
 iske chalate aarthik rup se pichde tabake ko 10 pratishat kaa kota mil gaya
 The ordinance was challenged in the Gujarat High Court in August 2016
 baad main roopani sarkaar ne gujarat hoicourt ke faisle ko supreme court main chunauti di
 The ordinance was repealed on 4 October 2016
 duvidha main hardikcongress ko ultimatum dekar hardik patel khud duvidha main funs gaye hai
 According to media reports, Hardik met Rahul Gandhi last week in Ahmedabad
 haalanki baad main unhone is mulaakaat ko khaarij kar diya tha
 According to sources, Hardik had demanded Patidars for jobs and educational institutions in this meeting
 hardik ne rahul se poocha tha ki congress kaise patidaaron ko kota dilaaegi? sanvaidhanik rup se patidaaron ko aarakshan dilaane main aa rahi adchanon ko dur karne ke bare main bhi hardik ne poocha tha
 According to sources, Hardik had asked the Congress to clear all these situations before extending its support in the Gujarat assembly elections
 ultimatum ke baad congress ne abhi chuppi saadh rakhi he
 If supported, the big vote bank will splash out from the Congress, the big vote bank of the OBC quota can be pulled from the Congress by attempting to accommodate the Patidar society into the OBC quota
 gujarat main obisi kota ke matadaataaon kii sankhya takreeban 54 pratishat he
 In such a situation, the question is, will Rahul Gandhi take the risk of splitting such a huge vote bank for the support of Hardik Patel? Rahul Gandhi cannot even promise a separate quota for the Patidar society, as this is not constitutionally possible
 nai party bananaa bhi mushkilgar rahul gandhi ne patidaar samaaj ko aarakshan dilaane kaa vaada nahin kiya to yah sabase zyada hardik patel ke liye mushkil kaa sabab ho saktaa he
 Hardik Patel has no chance of supporting the BJP
 hardik ke ultimatum par agar rahul koi jawaab nahin dete hai to unke paas third front ke alaava koi or vikalp nahin bachataa
 Now there is not much time left in the Gujarat elections, in such a situation, Hardik cannot even form a new party
 ab agar hardik chunaav se duuri banaate hai to patidaar netaa ke rup main unke vajood par bhi sawalia nishaan lag jayega
 Then pressure will be put on the new government
 If Rahul does not listen to Hardik, then there will be another option in front of Hardik as Aam Aadmi Party
 lekica aap kaa gujarat main abhi koi janaadhar nahin he
 This means that whatever government will come on Hardik's agenda again after the elections, he will have to put pressure on reservation for the Patidar society
 gujarat main patidaar samaaj ke liye aarakshan kii maang kar rahe hardik patel ke khilaaf police ne exiaar darj kii he
 He is accused of insulting the national flag
 hardik ke khilaaf tapi jile ke vyaraa police stesan main FIR darj kii gai he
 Rajkot SP Gagandeep Gambhir said that when Hardik bounced and tried to sit in the car when police stopped him, the tricolor was touched by his leg
 hardik ko rajkot stadium ke baahar se hiraasat main le liya gaya tha
 It happened in the afternoon
 
 
 rajkot ke espi ne kaha ki hardik hameshaa surkhiyon main bane rahane kii koshish karte hai
 The same happened in the afternoon
 unhone jo kuch bhi kiya he, kanoon uski ijaajat nahin detaa, isliye unke khilaaf exiaar darj kii jaaegi
 The car will be seized, the driver will also take action
 The SP said that the police have seized Hardik's car and action will also be taken against the driver of the car, as he did not even have a license
 hardik or driver car ke kagajaat pesh nahin kar paae

 Well, that day the audience sitting in the ground got to see an innings which may not seem much bigger than today's records, but at least in that period it was like 'bhooto na Bhavishti'
 kapil dev ne uske baad roger binni ke saath chathe wicket ke liye 60 ran kii, ravi shastri ke saath saatven wicket ke liye 1 ran kii, aathven wicket ke liye madanlaal ke saath 62 ran kii or aakhirkaar nawein wicket ke liye wicketiper saiyad kirmani ke saath 126 ran kii naabad saajheedaari kii
 By the way, let us tell that this partnership is still the biggest partnership for the ninth wicket during the one-day World Cup, and in the whole history of one-day cricket, more than one run for the ninth wicket only once in the year 2010 vs Sri Lanka Australia were in the match, that is, kapil-kirmani's partnership in one-day cricket for 27 years remained a World Record
 kapil ne is pari main 'dhuandhar ballebaaj' ke rup main apni lokapriyata ko amali jama pahanaaya, or kul 138 gendon kaa saamana kar 16 chaukon or chah gaganabhedi chhakkon kii madad se naabad 175 ran banaae
 The biggest feature of this innings was that while none of the players of the Indian team faced the Zimbabwean bowlers, for Kapil as if he were a schoolboy, whose balls had no edge against an international batsman
 Don't be kapil ke alaava koi bhi ballebaaj kaamyaab nahin ho paaya, iskaa andaaza isi baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki team india kii taraf se kapil dev 175 (note out) ke aankade ke saath top scorer rahe, or unke baad sabase zyaada 24 naabad ran wicketiper saiyad kirmani ne banaae
 At the end of the innings, 266 runs were seen, losing eight wickets in 60 overs scheduled on the team's scoreboard (yes, one-day matches were 60-60 overs in those days)
 bharat kii ore se sunil gavaskar or krishnamachari shrikant shunya par or sandip patil or ravi shastri 1-1 ran par out hue, jabaki mohinder amarnath ne 5 tathaa yashpal sharma ne 9 ran banaae
 Apart from Kapil and Kirmani, Dahi's figures were touched by a total of two batsmen, of which Madan Lal contributed 17 and Roger Binny contributed 22 runs
 zimbabwe kii ore se roson or kurran ne teen-teen tathaa captain dancan flechar tathaa jon trycos ne ek-ek bhartiya khilaadi ko pavilion lautaaya
 Despite a very laudable performance in batting, Kapil's innings led to a highly respectable score, prompting the Indian bowlers to have a sharp performance in the back-to-back innings, and did not let any opposition batsman play for too long
 zimbabwe kii taraf se kevin kurran sabase kaamyaab ballebaaj rahe, jinhone 93 gendon main aath chaukon kii madad se 73 ranon kaa yogadan diya, or duusare number par rahe salaami ballebaaj robin brown, jinhone 66 gendon kaa saamana kar do chaukon kii madad se 35 ran banaae
 Apart from these two batsmen, no batsman could last much longer, and the entire team was all out by scoring 235 runs in 57 overs
 bharat kii ore se madanlaal ne 42 ran dekar teen khilaadiyon ko pavilion lautaaya, jabaki roger binni ne 45 ran dekar do khilaadiyon ko out kiya
 Apart from these, Captain Kapil Dev, Balwinder Sandhu and Mohinder Amarnath took one wicket each
 zimbabwe ke do khilaadi bharatiyon kii chust fielding kaa shikaar hokar ran out hue
 After this match, the Indians were freshly shot, and they avenged their loss to Australia in the very next league match, and secured a place in the semi-finals
 ab tak josh se labalab bhar chuki team india ne iske baad toornament ke pehle semifinal main mejabaan england ko bhi patkhni de daali, or ab muqabla 'badshaah' se hona tha, kyonki duusare semifinal main west indies ne pakistan ko haraa diya
 But in the final of that World Cup, Team India, adorned with all-rounders, did the feat which Indians themselves had not imagined
 dhurandharon se bhari west indies team ke saamne pehle ballebaaji karte hue jab bhartiya team 54
 All out for 183 runs in 4 overs, everyone still believed that the West Indies team was going to lift the World Cup trophy for the third time in a row, but 'kapil's team' thought something else
 'haar nahin maanenge' ke jazbe ke saath bharatiyon ne gendbaaji shuru kii, or 'badshaah' ko 52 over main kul 140 ranon par dher kar trophy apane kabje main kar lee
 Kapil Dev was the highest run-scorer for India in the tournament
 unhone aath maichon kii aath pariyon main teen baar note out rahakar 60
 He scored a total of 303 runs with the help of an unbeaten century at an average of 60, and was ranked fifth overall on the list of top scorers
 
 
 toornament main 76
 The highest 384 runs at an average of 80 were scored by England's David Gower after being unbeaten twice in seven innings of seven matches, including a century and a half-century
 suchi main number do par west indies ke vivian richards the, jinhone aath maichon kii saat pariyon main do baar naabad rahakar 73
 He hit 367 runs at an average of 40, including a century and two fifties

 He scored 313 runs with the help of one century and two fifties at an average of 60
 jahaan tak gendbaaji kaa sawaal he, bharat kii jeet main bahut bada yogadan unka bhi rahaa
 If you look at the figures, the successful bowler of the World Cup was Roger Binny of India, who 18 in eight matches
 66 kii ausat se 18 wicket chatkaaye the
 In this list, India's Madanlal finished jointly with Sri Lanka's Ashanta Dimel, and both had taken 17-17 wickets

 41 kaa rahaa
 The record for Kapil Dev's biggest ODI innings was broken the next year by West Indies batsman Vivian Richards, when he hit an unbeaten 189-ball 170 against England in Manchester, including 21 fours and five sixes
 vaise, kapil kaa yah record ab tak bahut baar tut chukaa he, or kai bhartiya or videshi ballebaajon ne kapil se badi paariyaan kheli hai
 Currently Rohit Sharma sits at the top of the list of greatest individual innings in the history of one-day International cricket, scoring 264 runs in 173 balls with 33 fours and nine sixes against Sri Lanka on 13 November 2014 in Kolkata
 
 rohit sharma ke alaava bhi kai bhartiya kapil se kahin aage nikal chuke hai, or is suchi main virendra sahvaag, sachin tendulkar, mahendra singh dhoni, saurav ganguli or viraat kohli bhi kapil se upar hai
 Apart from these, many foreign batsmen have also left Kapil behind, but even though Kapil Dev has slipped to number 23 in the list of the biggest individual innings in the history of one-day International cricket, but still in the heart of Indian fans, Tunbridge Wells That innings played in Kapil is bigger than every big innings
 kapil ne is pari main 'dhuandhar ballebaaj' ke rup main apni lokapriyata ko amali jama pahanaaya, or kul 138 gendon kaa saamana kar 16 chaukon or chah gaganabhedi chhakkon kii madad se naabad 175 ran banaae

 The petitioner's argument is that it is unconstitutional to use party symbols in MCD elections, so if the Election Commission does not issue a notification soon, it will be extremely difficult to prevent candidates contesting elections in the next MCD election from using party symbols in elections
 yachikakarta kaa aarope he ki 3 janvari 2017 ko phir jawaab daakhil karne ke liye 2 saptaah kaa samay ayog ne maang liya lekin abhi tak jawaab daakhil nahin kiya he

 unhone court ko bataaya ki nigam chunaav april 2017 main hone hai, aise main ayog ko is maamle main jald hi nirnay lene kaa nirdesh dena chahie or saath hi deree karne ke liye ayog par jurmaana bhi laganaa chahie

 — Azmi Shabana (@azmishabana)july 9, 2019bataa den ki shabana azmi ne shanivaar ko kisi political party yaa vichaardhaara kaa naam liye bina kaha tha ki logon ko deshhit main apane man kii baat kehane se darana nahin chahie
 Shabana said that if we do not pay attention to the deficiencies then how will the situation improve
 ek maamle kii sunwaayee ke dauraan madras hai court ke jaj ne kaha ki dhokhebaajon kii ungliyaan or unke haath kaat die jane chahie
 Sitting Judge s Vaidyanathan of the Madras High Court was hearing the land fraud case
 unhone kaha, 'haal hi main maine iraan main aparaadhiyon kii sajaa par ek lekh padhaa
 New punishment has been set for fraudsters in Iran
 aise logon kii ek mashin se ungliyaan kaat di jaati hai
 a machine has been placed in Shiraz's court to cut the fingers of such criminals
 ' unhone afsos jataayaa ki aisa kanoon hamaare desh main nahin he
 He said that there should be such a law in our country for fraudsters who make fake documents
 agar is tarah ke kade kanoon honge to apradhi aisi jaalsaji nahin karenge
 He also said that the hands of such officers of the Sub Registrar's Office should also be cut off, who together with such criminals grab the property of the people
 unhone is maamle par dhokhaa dene vaale shaks par ek lakh rupee kaa jurmaana lagaaya
 He has also ordered this amount to be distributed equally among the four institutes in Chennai, one of which is a cancer institution
 kya desh kii pehle swadeshi parmaanu pandubbi kaa kamishan ho chukaa he? is bare main kisi se puuchhie to koi bhi munh kholane ko taiyaar nahin he? or to or iskaa naam lene se bhi adhikari bachate dikh rahe hai
 By the way, it is also believed that Arihant has joined the Navy, but no one is ready to speak on it
 bhartiya nausena ke yudhpot utpaadan or kharid niyantrak vaais admiral jies pabbi se jab parmaanu pandubbi, ienes arihant ke nausena main shaamil hone ke bare main poocha gaya to unhone kaha ki yah behad sanvadensheel ishyu he, lekin is par ham jald hi anounsament karenge
 When asked when to announce, just said that soon
 ve bhi bataane ko taiyaar nahin hai ki arihant kaa abhi bhi samandar main trial chal rahaa he yaa phir kamishan ho chukaa he! Significantly, all the trials of Arihant have been successful, just waiting, then the official announcement to give the green signal
 iske kamishan par sabaki najar he, chaahe vah china ho yaa pakistan, kyonki bharat ke paas pehle se aasmaan yaa jameen se lambii duuri tak maar karne vaali parmaanu misile hai
 Now with its arrival, India's strength on the sea front will also increase manifold
 tippaniyan India has become the sixth country after the US, France, Russia, Britain and China to achieve success in building its nuclear submarine
 chah hajaar ton vajani arihant main 750 kilometre se lekar 3500 kilometre tak kii maarak kshamta vaali misile hai
 This allows nuclear missiles to be fired under water and from the surface of water
 yahi nahin, pani ke andar se kisi vimaan ko bhi nishaanaa banaaya ja saktaa he
 Arihant was launched by former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in 2009
 tab yah kaha gaya tha ki do saal ke bheetar hi pandubbi kaa kamishan ho jayega lekin kai vajahon se der hoti rahi
 Currently, India has a nuclear submarine INS Chakra leased from Russia
 bharat arihant kii tarah teen pandubbi bana rahaa he
 Vice Admiral GS Pabbi, the Indian Navy's warship production and procurement controller, when asked about the nuclear submarine, INS Arihant, to join the navy said that this is a highly sensitive issue, but we will soon announce it
 jab poocha gaya ki kab anouns karenge, to bas itnaa hi kaha ki jald
 They are also not ready to tell whether Arihant is still under trial in the sea or has been commissioned! gauratlab he ki arihant ke saare trial safal ho chuke hai, bas intjaar he to adhikarik taur par elaan karke hari jhandi dene kaa
 Everyone is eyeing its commission, whether it is China or Pakistan, because India already has long-range nuclear missiles from the sky or land
 ab iske aa jane se samandar ke morche par bhi bharat kii takat kai guna bad jaaegi
 The comments bharat, america, france, rus, britain or china ke baad chatha aisa desh ho gaya he jisane apni parmaanu pandubbi banane main kamyaabi hasil kii he
 The six thousand tonne Arihant has missile ranges ranging from 750 km to 3500 km
 isse pani ke andar or pani kii sataha se parmaanu missile daagi ja sakati he
 Not only this, any aircraft can also be targeted from under water
 purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne 2009 main arihant ko laanch kiya tha
 It was then said that the submarine would be commissioned within two years but it was delayed due to several reasons
 philhal bharat ke paas rus se lij par lee gai parmaanu pandubbi ienes chakra he
 India is building three submarines like the Arihant
