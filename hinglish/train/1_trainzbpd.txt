 But the memories of his son are so mixed as in The Sky is Pink that the happiness and sorrow of dripping drips in a single drop
 alag-alag nahin

 Sources were quoted as saying that shooter Purushottam, who was arrested on Monday, has told the police that a contract of Rs 2 crore was given for the murder of Kidipak Bhardwaj
 purushottam ne kisi guru swami kaa naam liya
 In an exclusive conversation with Aaj Tak, Anand Maharaj said that his name is not Guru Swamy and he is from Haryana, not Haryana
 haalanki unhone yah mana ki vah deepak bharadwaj ko saal 2007 se jaanate the
 In fact, unlike the claims of shooter Purshottam, there is no man named Guru Swami living in his village and Swami Anand Maharaj has an old acquaintance with the BSP leader
 aise main shaq kii sui swami anand maharaj kii ore ishaara kar rahi he
 On the day of the incident, within a few hours of firing, Swami reached Deepak Bhardwaj's farm house
 aaj tak se baatcheet ke dauraan anand maharaj ne kaha ki main deepak bharadwaj kaa guru tha or unase mere achche sambandh rahe hai
 However, he categorically denied that he was acquainted with Deepak's family
 unhone kaha, 'deepak kii hatya par mujhe dukh he
 i do not know why my name is being taken? 'aaj tak se unhone kaha, 'meri jaan-pahchaan deepak bharadwaj ke parivaaravaalon se nahin he
 Even i came to know from a third person that there were distances between Deepak Bhardwaj and his wife
 'anand maharaj ne yah bataaya ki bispi netaa ne unhen kabhi bhi kisi se dushmani ke bare main nahin bataaya
 Although i think he may have been killed for commercial or any other reasons

 ) There are only two types of hoardings of BJP in Varanasi
 ek main bhaajapa banaras or ganga ko lekar naare likhe hai or duusare main inhen baton ko lekar narendra modi kii tasviren hai
 Only pictures of Modi, but i saw this form covering the bjp's propaganda in the Patel area
 modi or apana dal vaale patel samaaj kii netaa anupriya patel kii tasviir ek saath
 In the picture, the biggest picture of these two was of Sardar Patel and the smallest picture of all three was Vajpayee
 is parche par likhe sanjhi viraasat or samskruti kaa matlab kya he, aap samaj sakate hai
 In a hoarding, none other than Vajpayee appeared with Modi, but here is Anupriya Patel
 yahaan tak ki bhaajapa adhyaksh rajnath singh bhi nahin
 In Varanasi itself, such pamphlets were not seen
 to kya ye sirf patel ilaake ke liye taiyaar kiya gaya he
 Not only this, the BJP has called Purushottam Rupala of Gujarat for campaigning in the Patel colony
 vahaan maujuud ek kaaryakarta ne bataaya ki ye patelon ke bade netaa hai
 Sardar Patel is being cleverly projected as a Patel leader in these neighborhoods
 vaise, sardaar patel ke bare main koi kitna bhi kahe patel or bhagat singh kii tasviren patel or jat samaaj kii reliyon main lagaai jaati hai
 Now why did BJP have to put up the picture of Anupriya Patel with Modi and why did Sardar Patel when both of them came
 aap iske kai matlab nikaal sakate hai, magar yah bhi dhyaan rakhiye ki isi parche ke peeche jaat-paat todane kii bhi baat likhi he taaki ilzaam na lage
 i did not even see the common posters of Anupriya Patel and Modi in the 'non Varanasi' areas where Patel is in large numbers
 kya pataa or meri nazar na padi ho! This is the new banner of Modi in Benaras
 isamen modi ke alaava bhi modi hi hai
 There is a very old picture of Modi bowing to the Ganges to reveal his old relationship with Ganga and Varanasi, to prove that Modi has an old relationship with Varanasi
 is tasviir main modi yuva lag rahe hai
 In Varanasi, where the BJP is so sure about its victory that now it only talks about the difference of victory, sometimes Anupriya Patel is sometimes sticking personal pictures of Modi's youth on a hoarding poster

 Perhaps this thinking gives me energy

 He explained to me that when Shivaji Ganesan is already present then why do you want to copy Shivaji Ganesan? This changed me completely
 unhone mere andar kii gati ko pahachaanaa jo kaam karne ke dauraan yaa phir abhinay ke dauraan mujhamen dikhti thi

 For the moment, i would like to say this much

 main raajnneeti main kuch alag karnaa chahta hum
 Otherwise why should i come? i am 67 years old and my health is also on the check up stage (smiling laughter)? It is not easy to enter politics at this age
 phir bhi badlaav laane ke sapane hai, aise badlaav jisase raajnneeti ke nazariye main, salike main badlaav aae
 Question- Based on your experience, how different do you find politics from films? Answer - i have not yet fully entered politics
 apane chote se anubhav se yahi kah saktaa hum ki yah bahut mushkil kaam he, sach main bahut hi zyada mushkil
 i told you not everything is a game, a drama
 cinema main har koi maujuud hota he nirmaataa, nirdeshak, lekhak

 That's why i was introduced to Vedas, Upanishads, meditation, etc
 from childhood

 Nothing new there then! Seriously is this the way forward for our “glorious summer game “? Touch screen comes after keypad, but now what next? Google is working on a technology that allows smart devices to run without touching them
 ham yahaan wais control kii baat nahin kar rahe hai, kyonki wais control abhi bhi he
 Google is working on Project Soli and now it has received federal approval
 is radar project par google 2015 se kaam kar rahi he
 Google has been working on this project for a long time
 iske tahat company kaa torget ye he ki bina screen ko tach kiye hue chutki baja kar divaais ko oparate kiya ja sakegaa
 As you might have seen in science fiction films, things are done without touching the screen
 iskaa behtareen udhaaharan hollywood film yranman ke gagetts hai
 Under this technology, you can start it by pinching it near the speaker, turning on the music, turning it off or operating a smart watch
 iske liye spikar main radar sensor lagaaya jayega
 The company had also brought its initial prototype, but could not succeed and failed to detect all kinds of motion
 aisa isliye hua kyonki is technolji ko yuj karne main pench he
 facebook objected to using the radar based motion sensor at high level and said that this would affect the current technology, so Google did not get the approval then
 haalanki baad main donon companiyon ne milakar baatcheet kii or rasta nikaala
 Google agreed to use it at a lower power level, and in return, Facebook did not oppose Weaver for Google
 ab google fedral communication kamishan se radar besd moshan sensor technolji yuj karne kii ijaajat mil gai he jise google Project Soli kahati he
 According to Google, through this sensor, users will be able to press buttons not visible between their thumb and index finger, which will be called virtual dial
 chutki bachaane par ye on ho jayega
 There is a video on Google's website in which it is shown
 google kaa kahana he ki yujar smart watch, mujeec scrol yaa phir ise yuj karte hue wolum aidjust kar saktaa he
 Google has said that this radar signal can also go inside the fabric, due to this, if your hand is in the pocket, you will still be able to control it
 company ne ye bhi kaha he, ‘haalanki ye control virtual hai, lekin iske saath interaction physical kii tarah hi lagegaa or vaisaa hi responsive bhi hoga
 You will feel the same way as a haptic sensation
 ’kul mila kar baat ye he ki ye technolji tach screen ko riples karne kii kshamta rakhti he, lekin yah abhi shuruaati daur main he or isamen abhi kaaphi samay lag saktaa he

 At the same time, suspended BJP MP from Darbhanga and former cricketer Kirti Azad has also made up her mind to walk with him step by step
 kirti aaazaad ne congress ke tikat par chunaav ladane kaa sanket diya he
 While speaking to journalists in Darbhanga, he praised Congress President Rahul Gandhi
 isse pehle shatrughna sinha buudhvaar ko argedy ke iftaar party main pahunchakar spasht sanket de chuke hai ki wo mahagathbandhan ki tikat par chunaav ladenge
 Last time, he won the Patna Sahib seat after defeating the Congress, but this time it seems that he is aiming to defeat the BJP by contesting on the Congress ticket
 mahagathbandhan main vaise bhi patna sahib kii seat congress ke khate main he
 It is believed that Shatrughan Sinha will contest on the Congress ticket
 haalanki, argedy kii taraf se bhi unhen tikat kaa ofer he
 Kirti Azad has also hinted at joining the Congress but the dilemma is that her seat has been contested by RJD from Darbhanga
 aise main vahaan se congress se tikat milanaa mushkil ho saktaa he
 From there, Muhammad Ali Ashraf Fatmi has been an MP on RJD ticket
 haalanki, unke liye is seat se bijepi ke khilaaf chunaav ladakar jeet hasil karnaa namumkin nahin hoga kyonki bijepi ke khilaaf golband hui party kisi tareeke se apane ko majboot sthiti main rakhana chaahati he
 Kirti Azad said that in the situation that BJP has created, they have only other option left
 ab wo darbhanga se kisi or party se chunaav ladenge or wo vikalp ek rashtriya party hogi
 The sign of Kirti's departure in the Congress is seen even more when Kirti Azad praised Rahul Gandhi fiercely and said that the Congress Party is moving ahead very fast under Rahul's efficient leadership
 rahul gandhi ke andar kaaphi dam bhi dikhataa he jo satta paksh (bijepi) ke liye khatre kii ghanti he

 input: bhashaa Two women got into a scuffle at the police station of Ameri village in Bilaspur
 inamen se ek usee gaanv kii purv upasarpanch niyantaa kurre he, jabaki duusari thane kii sab inspector durga kiran patel he
 The case caught fire when Nanta, annoyed with the functioning of the station in-charge, reached the police station on a matter
 maukey par unka saamana durga kiran patel se hua
 Sub Inspector Patel was doing some work at that time
 unhone niyantaa kurre ko koi rispons nahin diya
 On the other hand, instructed to talk to other policemen present in the police station
 is dauraan sab inspector patel or purvaupasarpanchake bich vaad vivaad kii sthiti ban gai
 The dispute grew so much that a scuffle ensued between the two
 donon ne ek duusare par waar kiya, lekin niyantaa kurre baari padi
 He grabbed the woman si's hair and dragged her to some distance
 yahi nahin, bich bachaav karne ai mahilaon kii bhi niyantaa ne nahin suni or esai ko peethti rahi
 The policemen present at the police station rescued them in some way
 iske baad sab inspector durga kiran patel kii shikaayat par upasarpanch niyanta kurre ko giraftaar kar liya gaya
 The police have registered a crime against him for abusive abuses and obstructing government work
 apni safai dete hue niyantaa kurre kaa aarope he ki unhone SI se ek pulicekarmi ishwari mishra ke bare main poocha
 But instead of talking to her adamantly, she became angry and at first they abused her
 isse naaraaz hokar hi unhone use danta tha
 Whereas according to SI Durga Kiran Patel, she was attacked first by the angry Nianta Kurre
 maine use samajhane kii koshish kii lekin wo mujhe gaaliyaan dene lagi
 However, the two women have filed complaints against each other

 (input bhashaa se) Before every election, claims are made over the performance of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the country's largest state Uttar Pradesh (UP)
 
 
 rajya ke netaaon kaa pataa nahin, magar centre ke netaa is khushrahmi main rahete hai ki party '90 ke dashak ke sunahare daur main waapas ja rahi he
 
 
 Whether it is assembly elections or Lok Sabha elections, it is claimed every time before the vote that the BJP is returning to its core vote bank i
e
 forward and the BJP regains the lost strength with the support of non-yadav backward and non-jatav Dalits
 Leggie, but the confusion breaks as the result arrives
 
 
 varsh 2004 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bhaajapa ne jaadui ranneetikaar maane jane vaale pramod mahajan ko upi kii kaman saunpi, magar vah naakaam sabit hue
 
 
 In the Lok Sabha elections 2009, Arun Jaitley could not show any charisma
 
 
 pichley vidhansabha chunaav main sanghathan par pakad rakhane vaale sanjay joshi ko nitin gadakari ne kaman di, magar bhaajapa kii siten ghat gayi
 
 
 This time Amit Shah, called Narendra Modi's right hand, has been given the charge of Uttar Pradesh, and currently the party president Rajnath Singh is also from Uttar Pradesh
 
 
 party ke pradhanmantri pad ke pratyaashee narendra modi ko lekar rajya main kaaryakartaaon main jabardast utsaah he, or aam logon main unhen lekar dilchaspee he
 
 
 There is a huge crowd in all of Modi's rallies in UP, but with the announcement of candidates, the party is seen coming off the air and coming to the ground
 
 
 upi or bihar ke bare main hameshaa kaha jaataa he ki chunaav se pehle chaahe jis party yaa netaa kii hawa ho, magar jamini str par akalan tabhi ho saktaa he, jab sabhi partiyon ke ummidavaaron ke naamon kaa elaan ho jaae
 
 
 The BJP released its first list of 53 candidates for Uttar Pradesh on 15 March and since then its claims of winning more than 50 seats have been exposed
 
 
 ummidavaaron ke khilaaf kaaryakartaaon kaa gussa sadakon par dikhne laga he
 
 
 BJP leaders are once again troubled by the fears of the same treachery that the party has been hunting for the last two decades
 
 
 bhaajapa kaaryakartaaon ko samaj nahin aa rahaa he ki rashtriya adhyaksh rajnath singh gajiabad se lakhanu kyon gaye
 
 
 And why is external candidate General VK Singh being fielded again from Ghaziabad
 
 
 general wike singh ko sainikon ke parivaar waalon kii bahulata vaali rohtak yaa jhunjhunuun jaisi seat se tikat kyon nahin diya gaya
 
 
 BJP workers are surprised as to why the party is intent on giving tickets to Dumriaganj, which has been spewing fire against Modi and BJP in Parliament and television studios for the last five years
 
 
 do baar vidhansabha chunaav haarane ke baavjood kesharinath treepathi kaa naam elahabaad se kyon liya ja rahaa he
 
 
 Party workers are on the streets against giving ticket from Deoria to Kalraj Mishra, who won the assembly elections for the first time
 
 
 bijanour se edwocket rajendra singh ko tikat dene ke khilaaf kaaryakartaaon main gussa he
 
 
 Slogans are being raised against General VK Singh in Ghaziabad
 
 
 amit shah party kii baithkon main netaaon-kaaryakartaaon se kehete rahe hai ki ummidavaar chaahe koi ho, lekin party kaa kahana he ki har seat par modi hi ummidavaar hai
 
 
 Obviously, the bjp's strategy is only to ask for votes in the name of Modi, but Narendra Modi himself says that no matter how fast the wind is moving, if you hold the tube and stand up it will not automatically fill the air
 
 
 yani matadaataaon ko matdaan centre tak laana hi padegaa
 
 
 The question is whether the UP voter will walk to the polling booth in the name of voting for Modi himself
 
 
 yaa phir ummidavaaron ke chayan se naaraaz bhaajapa kaaryakarta unhen matdaan kendron tak laaenge
 
 
 There is still only one ray of hope for the BJP in UP
 
 
 vah yah he ki rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (aresas) ke kaaryakarta har booth ko sanbhaalenge or bhaajapa or modi ke paksh main votaron ko booth tak laaenge
 
 
 But it is certain that delays and mistakes in the selection of candidates have given the BJP a huge blow in the state

 Similarly, prior to the release in July 2014, 1,500 copies of Anu Singh Chaudhary's book Neela Scarf had been booked
 divya prakaash dube se lekar ashish choudhary jaise yuva lekhakon kii kitabon ke bare main bhi aisi hi sthiti thi
 This is a new trend for Hindi literature books, which are notorious for craving sales
 hind yugma ke sampadak shailesh bharatvasi bataate hai, ''hindi kitabon kii pre booking bilkul taaja or apurv trend he
 The reason behind this is the increasing trend of online shopping of Hindi books, the most important is that these new writers are connected to the corporate and marketing world
 ve peshewar tareeke se apni kitabon ko promot kar rahe hai
 "it is a sign of the arrival of a new generation equipped with the tools of the information revolution in Hindi literature
" iskaa asar na sirf kitabon kii marketing main najar aa rahaa he balki hindi kitabon kii vishay vastu main bhi is dakhal kaa abhas hota he
 The story that connects youth: Thirty-three-year-old Ashish Chaudhary was tempted to write stories during his college days
 lekin unke papa poochhate, ''kamai ke liye kya karoge?'' ashish hanskar kehete hai, ''dekhie, ab sirf likh kar hi kama rahaa hum

 bhashaayi shuddhtavaad se aazaadihindi ke nai peedi ke lekhakon main sabase mahatvapurn badlaav unki bhashaa he
 Naturally, this is the result of change in the language of Hindi society
 hindi sahitya kii bhashaai shuddhta kaa daur khatm ho gaya he
 The glimpse of this is clearly visible in the books of these authors
 divya prakaash apni pehali hindi kitaab kaa naam angreji main Terms and conditions apply yun hi nahin dete hai
 See Ashish Choudhary's book: Kulfi & cappucino
 internet yug ke sadhano se lasadivya prakaash ne 2013 main apni pehali kitaab terms and condishans applai lonch karne ke liye anuthi pahal kii
 He launched an interesting video trailer of the story of that collection, Lolita
 isi tarah apni kitaab masala chaay kii kahaniyon kaa bhi trailor relies kiya
 Earlier Pankaj Dubey had also made a video promo of Luzar Kahin Ka
 hindi kitabon kii duniya main yah nayaa prayog he
 Obviously, all these are using the Internet, social sites and technology tools in the promotion of books
 ye nae kissago apni kitabon kii packaging or marcenting main koi kasar nahin chhod rahe
 Like traditional Hindi litterateurs, they were not wrapped in the cover of seriousness or completely dependent on publishers of the kind of submissive type
 bule kehete hai, ''market ke hisaab se packaging main kya buraai he? lokapriyata or pathakon ko aakarshith karne ke liye packaging kii hi jaani chahie

 He has also written a very good report in Hindi on his visit to the untouched states of the Northeast
 ve hindi kitabon kii duniya main kud padi nai peedi ko lekar ahm chintaa jaahir karte hai, ''nai peedi ke lekhakon kii samvednaa kaa falak bahut hi chota he
 Therefore, they are unable to express the current reality of the society
 '' apwaadon ko chhod diya jaae to unki yah chintaa beja nahin he
 He explains, "earlier there were many big writers who roamed in different types of society
 isliye unka anubhav sansar bada tha
 But now they are middle-class jobbers
 adhiktar prem par likh rahe hai, lekin vah bhi uthlaa or banaavati garh kar
 "gaurinath of Antika Prakashan also points to this," most of the alleged authors of this kind are simply showing off
 jabaki unki kahaniyon main koi dam nahin
 "but Ravi Bulle says," Today, classics and popular debates have become meaningless
 bhale hi in nae lekhakon kii style or anubhav juda hon, lekin unako tavajjo na dene se hindi kitabon kii duniya sikud jaaegi or pathak varg kaa vistaar nahin hoga
 "obviously, the new generation Hindi writers have all the modern tools of technology, but their challenge is whether they are able to give sustained or effective stories and really connect the readership

 During the discussion in the Rajya Sabha on Thursday on Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in retail, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Arun Jaitley said that few days are left of the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government at the Center
 loksabhaa main paryaapt sankhya bal jutaney ke liye vah duusari partiyon par nirbhar thi
 The way he won the House, he will have to pay a huge price
 jetali ne kaha, sarkaar loksabhaa main 272 ke aankade tak pahunch nahin pai
 The government cannot see the 254 figure as a victory
 jab aapke paas bahumat se 18 kam sankhya he to aap sarkaar nahin chalaa sakate
 Looking at the Lok Sabha data, it seems that the days of the government are over
 vah jald hi jane vaali he
 He said that the government depended on other parties and it would have to pay a huge price
 unhone kaha, yah mahangaa samarthan tha
 You (the government) have to pay for it every day
 ham dekhenge ki aane vaale dinon main yah samarthan kis prakaar desh ke prashasan ko prabhavit karata he
 Jaitley said that BJP is not against FDI
 mudda yah he ki isaki anumati kis kshetra main di jaae
 He said, will some western countries set the criteria for economic policies in India? We have never been against FDI
 lekin yah kis kshetra main hona chahie, ise saavdhaneepurvak dekhne kii jarurat he
 The country should take this decision on the basis of losses and benefits from FDI in all sectors
 unhone kaha ki 18 se 20 karod log khudara kaarobaar par nirbhar hai
 So, Walmart will not be right for these people from anywhere
 nirmaan kshetra main isse naukariyon ko nuksaan hoga
 He further said, not every change is an improvement
 ab duniya ko sudhaar kii paribhaasha batalaane kaa vakt aa gaya he
 The government has made policies, but still no reforms
 unhone kaha ki main kapil sibbal ko chunauti detaa hum ki vah apane sansadeey kshetra chandani chowk main videshi retail store khulwakar dikhaaen
 Arun said that the NCP, the party's biggest advocate of FDI, Sharad Pawar has said in Maharashtra that it will not allow it to be implemented in the state
 unhone kaha ki retail main epadiai se videshi samaan bharat ke store main bikega, jo ki desh ke bilkul acha nahin he
 He gave the example that two years ago, Walmart had a turnover of 21
5 billion rupees and India's total retail market is 1
5 trillion
 yani bharat ke bazaar se uskaa turnover doguna he
 Arun said that it is always argued that this will eliminate middlemen, but after its arrival big middlemen will be born
 kaha jaataa he ki isse kisaanon ko phayda hoga, to bataanaa chahta hum ki agar kisaanon ko maalamaal karnaa hota to europe or america ke kisaan ab tak kaaphi amir ho chuke hote
 The reality is that the governments there give huge subsidies to the farmers
 vahaan ke sthaneey logon ke virodh ke hi chalate manahaton main bhi wallmart nahin khul paaya
 The comments jetali ne sarkaar ko aagaah kiya ki sarkaar retail main epadiai laakar tik nahin paaegi
 (also from inputs agency) jetali ne kaha, sarkaar loksabhaa main 272 ke aankade tak pahunch nahin pai

 The comments jetali ne sarkaar ko aagaah kiya ki sarkaar retail main epadiai laakar tik nahin paaegi
 (also from inputs agency) unhone kaha ki sarkaar anya dalon par nirbhar thi or isaki use badi keemat chukaani padegi
 This, he said, was costly support
 aapako (sarkaar) har din isaki keemat chukaani padegi
 We will see how this support affects the administration of the country in the coming days
 jetali ne kaha ki bhaajapa epadiai ke khilaaf nahin he
 The issue is in which area it should be allowed
 unhone kaha, kya kuch pashchimi desh bharat main aarthik nitiyon kaa maandand tay karenge? ham epadiai ke khilaaf kabhi nahin rahe
 But in which area it should be, it needs to be looked at carefully
 desh ko sabhi kshetron main epadiai se hone vaale nuksaan evam phaayde ke aadhaar par yah nirnay lenaa chahie
 He said that 18 to 200 million people depend on retail business
 so, wallmart kahin se bhi in logon ke liye sahi nahin hoga
 This will hurt jobs in the construction sector
 unhone aage kaha, har badlaav sudhaar nahin hota
 Now the time has come to tell the world the definition of reform
 sarkaar ne nitiyaan banaai hai, lekin phir bhi sudhaar nahin hue
 He said that i challenge Kapil Sibal to open foreign parliamentary store in his parliamentary constituency Chandni Chowk
 arun ne kaha ki epadiai ke sabase bade pairokaar sharad pavaar kii party ensipi ne maharashtra main kah diya he ki vah abhi rajya main ise lagu nahin hone degi
 He said that FDI in retail will be sold in stores in foreign similar India, which is not at all good in the country
 unhone udhaaharan diya ki do saal pehle walmart kaa turnover saadhe 21 lakh karod tha or bharat kaa total retail bazaar saadhe das lakh karod kaa he
 That is, its turnover from the Indian market is double
 arun ne kaha ki hameshaa daleel di jaati he ki isse bichauliye khatm ho jaaenge, lekin iske aane ke baad bade bichauliye paidaa ho jaaenge
 It is said that this will benefit the farmers, so i want to tell that if the farmers had to prosper, then the farmers of Europe and America would have been very rich by now
 hakeekat yah he ki vahaan kii sarkarein kisaanon ko baari sabsidi detii hai
 Due to opposition from the local people, Walmart could not open in Manhattan

 During the monsoon year or year in Uttarakhand, some village, town or city is being destroyed by disaster
 prashasnic mashinari aapadaaon se bachaav ke liye kargar tareeke ijad karne main ab tak naakaam rahi he
 Surely former IAS officer Surendra Singh Pangati, this state is at the very end of the Himalayas where disasters are sure to happen, but both the common people and the government will have to come forward to create a mechanism to avoid it, but in 17 years, there is no lesson from the disasters
 Gone
 abhi 2013 main ai kedaar aapadaa ke jakhm bhare bhi na the ki saal dar saal aapadaaen kahin na kahin apana prabhaav dikhaa hi rahi hai
 During the Kedar disaster, a place called Rambara was mattified
 is saal 14 agast kii raat kailash maansarovar yatra path par malpa or maangati kaa namonishaan mit gaya
 The bodies of the people and army personnel have not been discovered till now
 is aapadaa main 30 log kaal kavlit ho gaye
 The two halts, 45 and 65 km from the headquarters of Dharchula Tehsil of Pithoragarh, the frontier district of Uttarakhand, were in full swing by midnight on August 13
 lekin agali subah badal fatne se machi tabaahi ne in donon padaavon main soye logon ko bachane kaa tak mauka nahin diya
 The maximum damage occurred in Ghattabgarh, Malpa and Mangati regions
 sena ke base camp ghattabgad main badal fatne kii ghatana main army ke kai jawan shahid ho gaye
 Army tents and people's shops along the road were also washed away
 army ke do trek pani ke tej bahaav main bahakar laapata ho gaye
 The remaining trucks and baggage suffered extensive damage
 maangati naale ke donon taraf ke pahunch maarg, suraksha deevaaren, khet or lage jangal bhi bah gaye or peyajal line dhwast ho gayi
 The Kailash Mansarovar Yatra route was missing from many places
 malpa se judye vaali puliya najaangad main bah gai
 The footpath was swept away, due to which it is not possible to reach the foot of Malpa area at present
 puraa malpa kshetra 1998 kii aapadaa kii bhaanti malbe se pat gaya
 Four hotels and kutcha houses were washed away
 iske baad kailash maansarovar yatra ko kuch samay ke liye rokkar yatra main ja chuke log air likrat kiye gaye or phir kailash maansarovar yatra ko bhi kuch padaavon main air lift kar bheja gaya
 However, the journey is over now
 maangati main kendriya rajyamantri ajay takvata vidhayak bishan singh chuphaal samet kumayun ayukta, di

 Arrived
 unke daure ke baad aapadaagrast kshetra malpa main itibipi, esasabi, esadiaref ke jawan tainaat hue hai
 a large quantity of food grains was also sent by helicopter to Malpa
 nuksaan kaa jayja lene ke liye vidhayak pushkar sih dhami ke saath vidhayak puuran singh fertiyal samet virendra sih paal, rajendrr singh ravat or basant joshi ne aapadaagrast kshetra kaa daura kar mukhyamantri ko report saunpi
 Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat said that every effort has been made to provide quick relief to the people affected by the disaster affected areas
 mukhyamantri ne kaha ki samiti kii report par aavashyak karrwai kii jaaegi
 Pushkar Dhami met the Chief Minister and demanded immediate mining, use of explosives and unscientific methods of stones in highly sensitive river valley areas in view of landslides and floods
 unhone sujhaayaa ki bhu-skhalan kii drushti se samvedansheel kshetron kaa vargeekaran ho or ati samvedansheel kshetron ke aas-paas basii aabaadi ko anyatra punervasit kiya jaae
 Bhagat Singh Koshyari, former Chief Minister of Uttarakhand and currently MP from Nainital Lok Sabha
 aapadaagrast gaanvon—malpa, maangati, gunji, bundi or chhiyaalekh kii yatra kar aae hai
 In many places, he had to reach people with the help of ropes
 aisa nahin he ki is kailash maansarovar maarg main yah pehali durghatana ho
 Earlier, in 1998, the Kailas Mansarovar Yatra team had become a victim of disaster in Malpa, when around 250 people, including Mansarovar Yatris, were buried under debris due to the collapse of the mountain here
 film abhinayta kabir bedi kii patni or prakhyat orishi nrutyaangna protima bedi bhi isi yatri dal kii hissaa thim
 After the incident, Malpa was not allowed to stay as a passenger, but the other end of it was definitely settled, which this time was completely destroyed by the destruction of the cloud
 yahaan maansarovar yatriyon ke dabane kii yaad main bane sangrahalay ko bhi is baar kii aapadaa dabaa gai
 78 villages in Chamoli are on the verge of danger
 danger jone hone ke baavjoot ek dashak se in gaanvon kii visthapana nahin hui he
 Looking at the state of the state's disaster, the Disaster Management Department has prepared a list of landslides in 78 villages regarding the monsoon in Chamoli district alone
 chamoli jila bhi pithoragarh kii tarah hi aapadaa kii drushti se ati samvedansheel he
 In such a situation, it becomes difficult for the people of disaster affected villages to save their heads during the rains
 aapadaa prabandhan ne 78 ke vipareet 17 gaanvon ke visthaapan kaa prastaav shashan ko bheja bhi he, lekin ab tak ek hi gaanv farkande kaa hi visthaapan ho sakaa he
 Environmentalists and conservationists have consistently sought to ban the use of explosives in road construction in narrow valleys, prevent indiscriminate mining from rivers, strictly enforce mountain pruning rules, stop felling of trees
 sarkaar daawa karti rahi he ki usne rajya main aapadaa se nibatane ko aapadaa mantralay gathit kar kai faisle liye hai
 The state has formed its own State Disaster Relief Force
 jila or tehsil str par aapadaa raahat centre sthapit kiye hai lekin jab bhi kisi jagah aapadaa aati he to yah tantra isse nibatane main asahaay hi najar aata he
 If the information and communication system ever cheats, then the road traffic gets destroyed first
 jiske tahat hoti mushkil ke chalate is baar sarkaar ne satellite phone kharide hai or har jile ko thamaaye hai taaki sanchaar kii asuvidha se bachaa ja sake
 But these arrangements are insufficient
 saal 2012 main bharat ke mausam vibhaag ne rajya ke liye teen dopler radar manjuur kiye
 One of these was to be planted in either Mussoorie and Nainital and one in Pithoragarh, Chamoli and Uttarkashi districts
 vidambnaa dekhie ki ab bhi isaki sthapana ek bhi jagah par nahin ho saki
 Doppler radar is considered important for weather forecasting
 iske jariye chote-chote kshetron main sambhavit ativrishti kaa purvanumaan 15 minute se lekar ek ghante pehle tak lagaaya ja saktaa he
 According to state Additional Secretary Disaster Management, Savin Bansal, land has been set up for setting up these dappler radars in three places, namely Mussoorie Nainital and Almora, to be planted soon

 Former Team Anna member Kiran Bedi criticized Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal for organizing the 'janata Darbar', accusing him of lacking in 'mature' governance capacity
 kiran bedi ne kaha, sabhi achche shashan lok sunwaayee yojit karte hai
 Many senior police officers and bureaucrats have held public hearings
 isamen samaytalika tarika or nishchit rup se khulaapan hota he
 It is not held on the streets or on the roofs
 purv police adhikari ne kaha, yah unke daftaron main yojit kii jaati he
 Public hearing is a part of good governance, but it has a method, a purpose and a place for it
 kiran bedi ne kaha, isliye main samajhati hum ki yah sab paripakv shashan kshamta kaa maamla he, yah anbhavi shashan kaa bhi maamla he

 The victim has been identified as Mohammed Barkar Alam

 In the police complaint, Alam alleged that four unknown people stopped him on Sadar Bazar Marg and objected to wearing the traditional cap
 usne bataaya ki aropiyon ne use dhamkee di or kaha ki is ilaake main is tarah kii topi pahanane kii ijaajat nahin he
 "in Gurugram Muslim man told to remove skullcap, chant Jai Shri Ram"
 It is deplorable
 Exemplary action needed by Gurugram authorities
 We are a secular nation where @javedakhtarjadu writes “o paalan haare, nirgun or nyaare” & @rakeyshommehra gave us d song “arziyaan” in Delhi 6
 Alam said in his complaint, 'he removed my hat and slapped me and also asked him to raise the slogan' Bharat Mata ki Jai '
 ' usne kaha, ‘maine unke aadesh kaa paalan kiya or ‘bharat mata kii jai' kaa naaraa lagaaya lekin unhone mujhe ‘jai shriram' kaa udghosh karne ke liye kaha, jise karne se maine inkaar kar diya
 At this a young man picked up a stick lying on the road and started beating me mercilessly
 unhone mere pair or peeth par waar kiya
 'my thoughts on secularism emanate from honourable PM Mr Modi's mantra "sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Faith of all"
 i am not limiting myself to Gurugram incident alone, any oppression based on caste / religion is deplorable
 Tolerance & inclusive growth is what the idea of india is based on

 hamaare desh main zyaadaatar logon ko masaaledaar khaanaa khaanaa hi pasand hota he
 We like the aroma of spices and their sharp taste
 ham sabhi apane khaane main kai tarah ke masaalon jaise laal mirch, hari mirch, kaali mirch aadi kaa istemaal karte hai
 Although the use of spices doubles the taste of food, but the use of spices requires a lot of attention
 kai baar aisa hota he ki masaalon ke galat istemaal se khaane kaa swaad to bigadataa he hi, saath hi sehat par bhi galat asar padataa he
 By using too much spice in food, you start seeing its results in a very short time
 masaalon ke galat yaa adhik istemaal se jeebh jalane lagati he, aankh or naak se pani aane lagata he
 Actually, all these symptoms are the reaction of our body
 jiske turant baad ham in chizon ko munh se nikaal dete hai yaa phir pani kaa gilaas uthaa lete hai
 But many studies have said that drinking water immediately after eating too much spicy food is the wrong habit
 aise main sawaal yah uthta he ki bahut adhik masaaledaar khaane ke baad pani pine se hota kya he? darasal, masaaledaar khaane ke baad jab ham pani pite hai to uskaa asar sharir ke duusare hisson par bhi padataa he
 Here are some similar reasons, on the basis of which we can say that drinking water after eating spicy food can be dangerous: What is the reason for something hot or spicy? a chemical element called capsaicin itself Things are pungent and sharp in taste
 jab ham aisi koi bhi cheez khate hai to hamaare dimag ko ek sandesh miltaa he or hamen tikhe swaad kii anubhuti hoti he
 Is drinking water really an effective and effective remedy? Capsaicin is a non-polar ie non-polar element
 yah keval aise hi tatv main ghulansheel hota he jo adhruviya ho
 But water is a polar compound
 aise main ye jvalansheeltaa ko kam karne ke liye yah kargar nahin hota he
 This simply means that there is no benefit of drinking water after eating spicy
 par masaaledaar khaanaa khaane ke baad pani pine se hota kya he?jalan main raahat dilaane ke sthaan par pani us tikhepan ko munh ke duusare hisson main failaa detaa he
 a person feels more thirsty after getting hot
 par yah koi kargar upaay nahin he
 How to reduce the burning of spices? If you feel hot after eating something spicy, then it is better that you use a non-polar thing to reduce it
 aise main doodh pinaa kargar hoga
 It is a non-polar drink that dissolves capsaicin
 doodh ke seven se aapako turant raahat mahasoos hogi
 Apart from this, sharpness can also be reduced by eating cheese or other dairy products

 aisi ummid he ki isamen paanch din lag jaaenge or unhen ni:shulk nassau sthanantarit kiya jayega
 Earlier, Health Minister Duan Sends had said that 23 people have been killed due to the storm
 unhone yah bhi bataaya ki marane waalon kii sankhya 23 se bhi zyada hone kii ashanka he
 He said that only a few people were officially eligible to be declared dead and could not be added to the list of victims until the death was officially confirmed
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki philhal bujurgon or bimaaron ko bachaana va tatkaal sahaayta pradaan karnaa hi praathamikta he
 They are being moved to islands in the archipelago that have not been devastated by the storm
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne shanivaar ko pradhanmantri narendra modi par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki 'chaukeedaar' ne amethi or raibareli ke logon ke rojgaar or kaarkaanon kii 'chori' kii he
 Rahul said that Narendra Modi did not want to fill 22 lakh government jobs lying vacant
 ham ek saal ke bheetar 22 lakh sarkari pad bhar denge
 Panchayats will employ 10 lakh youth
 notebandi or jiesti par modi sarkaar ko aade haath lete hue rahul ne kaha ki pichley 70 saal main notebandi or jiesti se jaisi morrkhtaa kisi ne nahin kii
 Rahul questioned the people, 'where are Anil Ambani, Nirav Modi, Vijay Mallya, Lalit Modi

 co / q2szg6oaey — Congress (@incindia) April 27, 2019 Rahul said that the money of the 'nyaya' scheme will go to the bank accounts of women
 yah paisa hoga- 5 saal main 3,60,000 rupee yah ek aitihaasik nirnay he
 In a storm, the farmer is harmed
 us samay kisaan ko uske beemaa kaa paisa nahin miltaa
 Modi ji has given Rs 10,000 crores of insurance to farmers of India to people like Anil Ambani
 raibareli main sonia gandhi ke liye vot maangate hue rahul ne kaha ki karj na chukaane par kisaan ko jail ho jaati he or modi ji ke amir dost khule ghoomte hai
 Now we will not let this happen
 ab kisi bhi kisaan ko karj na chukaane par jail nahin hogi
 Apart from this, we will bring a separate budget for farmers
 rahul gandhi ne kaha ki jo main kahata hum, wo main karke dikhaata hum
 i do not lie
 chaukeedaar do hindustan bananaa chahta he, lekin ham aisa nahin hone denge- sirf ek hindustan hoga
 After Rae Bareli, Rahul will address two public meetings in his constituency, Amethi

 It is discussed that Jagdambika Pal, a Congress MP from Dumriaganj in Uttar Pradesh and the most popular face of the party in Purvanchal, can join the BJP
 iske alaava narendra modi ke saath manch saajha kar chuke purv senadhyaksh general wike singh bhi bijepi se jud sakate hai
 According to information from sources close to him, he may join the BJP on Saturday
 jagdambika ko laane par BJP main matbhed?jagdambika paal ke bijepi main aane kii koi netaa pushti karne ko taiyaar nahin he
 It is being told that some leaders of bjp's UP unit are opposing to bring him into the party
 jab is par ensipi netaa tarik anwar se poocha gaya to unhone kaha ki koi party kisi ko duusare dal main jane se nahin roak sakati
 If Jagdambika Pal wants to make a decision on her political career, it is her wish
 bijepi ke rashtriya upaadhyaksh mukhtaar abbaas nakvi ne kaha ki agar kuch hoga to khuleam hoga
 JDU leader Ali Anwar, calling it the 'aaya Ram, Gaya Ram' policy, said that those who used to abuse the BJP earlier are now joining the seed 
 wike singh ke kadam se anna ko lagegaa jhatka?vahiin general wike singh lambey samay se bhrashtachar ke khilaaf kaam kar rahe hai
 However, he too refused to confirm his joining BJP, stating that he was busy with Anna Hazare
 abhi yah bhi saaf nahin he ki bijepi unhen loksabhaa chunaav main tikat degi yaa nahin
 VK Singh's tenure as army chief has also been full of controversy
 ritair hone ke baad se hi unka rukh sarkaar virdohi rahaa he
 He is considered one of Anna Hazar's trusted colleagues
 anna kii ek or sahyogi kiran bedi bhi narendra modi kaa khulaa samarthan kar chuki hai
 At the same time, Anna is campaigning for Mamata Banerjee's party Trinamool Congress in West Bengal
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ab videshi sachivon yaa pratinidhiyon se hindi main baat kiya karenge
 Interpreters will be used to talk in Hindi, but instead of forming an opinion, read this news and keep a little leisure and look at all aspects
 shaayad iske baad koi raay banane kii gunjaaish hi naa rahe
 The Prime Minister is not soft with English
 dikkat itani he ki vah angreji bolne main sahaj mahasoos nahin karte
 They understand English well
 angreji kii praasangikta vah bhalee-bhaanti samajhate hai or isliye gujarat main bhi yuvaaon ko angreji sikhaane ke liye SCOPE naamak pahal kar chuke hai
 Started in 2007, SCOPE has trained 300,000 youth in English so far
 team modi ne ise bhi garv se jodakar hi prachaarit kiya he
 Source is the website of Narendra Modi
 gujarat summit main bhi shri modi angreji main bhaashan dete hue dikhe or apane mantriyon se bhi angreji main hi bhaashan dene ko kaha
 However, his lack of confidence was evident when speaking English
 2010 main apni kitaab ke anaavaran par angreji main hi baat kar rahe the
 Modi does most of his tweets in English
 to yah jaahir he ki yah hindi asmita ke liye uthaaya gaya saahasik kadam to katai nahin he
 His hand is tight in English, so he needs an interpreter and this should be easily seen
 atal bihari vaajapeyi angreji jaanate the or videshi pratinidhiyon se angreji main hi baat karte the, lekin desh ko hindi main sambodhit karte the
 In the minds of many people, the unfinished interview given to Mr
 Modi to Karan Thapar will still take place where Modi was giving his answers in broken English
 vaise 2014 tak aate-aate shaayad unhen apni is kami kaa ehsaas ho gaya hoga or unhone angreji media ko bhi hindi main hi saakshaatkaar die
 Arvind Kejriwal specializes in English, but still he likes to talk in Hindi to the English media
 arvind kejariwal ke samarthak ise hindi prem se jod kar dekh sakate hai, lekin unki kamajori ko bhi unke paksh main dhakelne ke liye team modi kii kavayad jari he
 Mulayam Singh Yadav has also welcomed it without thinking
 bhashaa ko sammaan se jod kar kyun dekha janaa chahie? hindi ko angreji se shreshth bataanaa usee tarah he jaise urdu ko hindi se yaa avadhi ko tamil se
 The purpose of language is only to explain your point to another, no matter what language you speak, no language is inferior
 narendra modi apane is kadam se naa kaabil-e-taareef hai or naa hi angreji kam aane kii vajah se mazaaq ke paatr
 If seen, the language gains its pride or its domination from the economy of its country
 angreji kaa mul europe main he, par ise lokapriy karne kaa shrey america ko jaataa he
 It is possible that if Japan were Superpower, then Japanese would probably be as popular as English
 hindustan ke bheetar bhi yahi baat dekhi ja sakati he
 There is a difference between respect for Bhojpuri and Tamil
 bijepi ke hi saansad manoj tiwari bhi kah chuke hai ki bhojpuri ko samvidhan main sthaan dilaayenge
 Language should not find a place in the constitution at this time, it is an unnecessary issue
 hindi jaisi bhashaaen korporate duniya main apni jagah kho chuki hai
 In the 16th Lok Sabha, Sushma Swaraj, Uma Bharti and Dr
 harshavardhan sanskrit main shapath lete najar aaye
 By the way, in olden times Sanskrit was mainly considered as the language of Brahmins
 vividhta se bhare is desh main pradhanmantri ke liye kisi ek bhashaa ko sweekaar karnaa kathin hoga
 It is also difficult for him to dismiss the need for English
 to is vaqt narendra modi ke dubhashiye kaa sahaara liye jane ko hindi prem yaa hindi asmita se jodakar unke chaahane vaale unhen pasopesh main daal denge
 Will the Prime Minister be able to make Hindi relevant in the corporate world? purv miss univers or bollywood actress sushmita sen ke liye duniya ek baar phir 360 degree gum gai he
 Where years ago after winning a title, she named India in the world of beauty in the world and now she is going to be a part of the same event once again but in another way
 sushmita sen jald hi hone vaale miss univers soundarya pratiyogita main ab jaj banakar hissaa lene vaali hai

 tippaniyan Sushmita Sen Pur is going to be a part of this competition again after 23 years and for this she seems very excited
 is maukey par sushmita ne instagram par ek bhaavnaatmak sandesh likhaa he
 Sushmita posted a photo of herself doing her makeup on Saturday and wrote, 'after 23 years, i feel very excited and passionate to once again go to Philippines like home
 yaheen se yah sab kuch shuru hua tha

 In such a situation, the public has high expectations from them and Umar understands them very well
 aise bhi gathbandhan sarkaar chalaanaa talwaar kii dhar par chalane jaisaa he
 Despite emerging as the largest party in the elections, NC is forming a government with the Congress in Jammu and Kashmir due to its lack of majority, but the good thing is that instead of dividing the Chief Minister's chair for three years, the entire six years is the same
 Congress has agreed to have chief minister
 yani khud ko sabit karne ke liye umr ke paas chah saal honge
 Along with Omar, two National Conference ministers and three ministers from the Congress will also take oath and it is possible that soon a Deputy Chief Minister will be formed to help Omar

 Markandey Katju, former chairman of the Press Council of India, in a post on social media has expressed concern over India's decision to go to the International Court against the decision to hang former Naval Officer Kulbhushan Jadhav by Pakistan Military Court
 fasebuk par likhe apane post main katju ne kaha kibharat ne pakistan ko mauka de diyaahai ki vah kashmir maamle ko sulajhane ke liye international court of justise ja saktaa he
 Katju's post has been taken up by the Pakistani media
 unhone likhaa, 'pakistan bahut khush hoga ki ham ek vyakti ke lieinternational courtchale gaye
 Now they can raise the issue of every way, especially Kashmir to international machinations, which we have been continuously opposing
 international court jaakar shaayad hamane pendorra box khol diya he
 In his post, Katju has also said that India has given a chance to Pakistan, that very little opposition has been lodged by Pakistan on the right to justice of the International Court of Justice, because India has given them a chance to raise other issues before the International Court of Justice
 have given
 katju ne likhaa, 'ham pakistan ke jhaanse main funs gaye hai or use anya muddon ko kholane kaa mauka de diya he
 This is the reason why Pakistan has not lodged a serious protest against the decision of the International Court of Justice
 'ICJ par sawaal uthaanaa hoga mushkil!unhone aage kaha, 'bharat ab aage international court ke faisle aapatti nahin jataa saktaa, agar pakistan kashmir mudde ko lekar world court main jaataa he
 It is now certain that Pakistan will go to the ICJ to resolve the Kashmir issue
 or tab world court ke adhikaar kshetra par aapatti jataane ke liye hamaare munh se hi jhooth nikalegaa
 Because you cannot be right and wrong together
 'world court ne jadhav kii faansee par lagaai rokbata den ki isi hafte international court of justise ne kulbhushan jadhav ke maamle main bharat ke paksh main faisla sunaate hue jadhav kii faansee par roak laga di
 Jadhav has been sentenced to death by the Pakistan Military Court on charges of espionage
 bharat ne pakistan ke is faisle par kadi aapatti jataai thi or jadhav ke kathith gunaah kabool karne vaale video kii pramanikta par sawaal uthaaya tha
 Pakistan presented this video as evidence
 pakistan ne nahin diya kansular accesisase pehle bharat ne pakistan se jadhav ko kansular acces dene kii maang kii thi
 This was appealed to the Government of Pakistan 16 times, but each time Pakistan refused
 iske baad bharat ne jadhav ko bachaane ke liye international court kaa darwaja khatkhataya

 This is published directly from Syndicate Feed) (NDTV team has not edited this news
 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he) The results of the panchayat elections in West Bengal, known for electoral violence and bloodshed, were announced on 17 May
 bengal main in chunaavon ke dauraan hui hinsa main kam se kam 14 log maare gaye or badi sankhya main log ghayal hue
 Several photos of violence during the election and many heart-wrenching videos came in front of us, but a video came out which saw people biting their fingers under the teeth
 booth capcharing ke bare main suna to sabane hoga, lekin is viral video main jis tarah khulamm khulaa booth lutaa ja rahaa he use dekhakar yakeen kar paanaa mushkil he ki koi chunaav aisa bhi ho saktaa he
 Ballet paper panchayat elections, you can see for yourself this video, there is a lot of stir in social media
 pashchim bengal main panchayat chunaav iviem nahin balki ballat paper se hue the
 The video went viral in such a way that it was called an example of rigging in the elections
 hamane is behad charchit video kii sachai kaa pataa lagane kaa faisla kiya
 On seeing the video, it becomes clear that this video is of West Bengal elections
 ballat paper par bijepi, trinmul congress, sipiem or congress party kaa chunaav nishaan saaf dekha ja saktaa he
 At the time when the man with white shirt is stamping the Trinamool Congress election mark on several ballot papers and putting it in the ballot box, it can also be seen that the polling hall is written in Bengali and English
 bengal panchayat chunaav kaa he videogin bailat papers par danaadan muhar lagaai ja rahi he wo pile rang kaa he
 Along with the other pink ballot paper with edges are also visible
 is baar bengal panchayat chunaav main jila parishad ke chunaav ke ballat paper kaa rang pilaa or panchayat samiti ke ballat paper kaa rang gulabi hi tha
 It is clear from these things that this video is only for the Bengal Panchayat elections
 agali chunauti ye pataa karne kii thi ki kya ye video isi chunaav kaa he or agar haa to phir, ye koun si jagah, koun si seat or booth koun sa he
 Careful listening in the video shows that apart from the person who is illegally stamping the ballot paper, there are at least two-three more people present there
 ye log tasviren le rahe hai or video bana rahe hai
 In the conversation in Bangla, the person making the video is trying to assure him that his face will not be seen
 kabhi-kabhaar video banane or photo lene main lage logon jhalak bhi video main dikh jaati he
 Once a professional camera lens also appears in the frame
 yani jab ye ho rahaa tha, ho saktaa he media ke kuch log bhi vahaan maujuud the
 Voting took place on 14 May When we contacted some local TV channels and newspapers in Bangla to find this out, it was found that the incident took place in North 24 Parganas district where voting took place on 14 May
 hamaari baat ek aise aadmi se bhi hui jisane naam gupt rakhane kii shart par hamen bataaya ki jab ye karnama ho rahaa tha us vakt wo vahiin par maujuud tha
 According to his claim, the incident took place in Rajarhat tehsil near Kolkata
 ye bhi pataa chalaa ki rajarhat ke patharghata gaanv main 14 may ko ek booth par is tarah se kabja kiya gaya tha or ye vahiin ki tasviren ho sakati hai
 After talking to several locals, it was found that this is an incident of booth number 204 where a child education center was made a polling booth
 lekin sidhe is daawey par yakeen karne ke bajaae ham ye pataa lagane main jute gaye ki kya vaaki ye patharghata kaa matdaan centre hi he
 It can be seen in the video that on the ballot paper, BJP has been printed on the first number, Trinamool on the second, CPM on the third and Congress on the fourth
 yani is seat par chaar ummidavaar maidan main the
 Candidates of 4 parties found that candidates of these four parties are in the fray on Patharghata seat number 33
 iske baat hamane pataa kiya ki ballat paper par partiyon yaa ummidavaaron ke naam kis kram se likhaa jaae iske liye kya niyam hai
 Election officials said that the decision of the parties and candidates on the ballot paper is written in an alphabetical order, but according to the Bengali language alphabet
 hamane patharghata seat number 33 par jila parishad chunaav ke liye ummidavaaron ke naam kii suchi nikaali
 BJP candidate name is Achint Kumar Naskar, Trinamool candidate Gaur Naskar, CPM candidate name Bapi Biswas and Congress candidate Ratna Bhattacharya
 bangla bhashaa ke hisaab se ye naam thik usee kram main aaenge jaise is bellatt paper par chapa he yani- bijepi, trinmul, sipiem or congress
 The election symbols of the parties can be clearly seen in the video, but to read the names of the candidates, we had to stop and watch the video with a handle
 chaaron naam vahi the-achint kumaar naskar, gaur naskar, baapi biswas or ratna bhattacharya
 That is, the fact that the seat is Pathharghata has been confirmed
 video main dikh rahaa he ki safed shart vaala vyakti saare muhar trinmul congress ke ummidavaar gaur naskar ke naam par laga kar ballat box main daal rahaa he
 So we talked to Gaur Naskar over the phone
 gaur naskar ne pehle to is video ke bare main kuch pataa nahin hone kii baat kahi, lekin jab hamane unase zyada poochhaatary karne kii koshish kii to unhone phone kaat diya
 Translated from Bangla to hindisawal: Are you talking Gaur Nuskar? Answer: Yes i am Gaur Nuskar
 sawaal: ek video viral hui jahaan ye dekhne ko mila kii aapke naam par booth capcharing hui he, jahaan aap ke naam par vot bhi daale ja rahe hai, kya ye sach he?jawaab: mujhe aap kii baat samaj nahi ai
 Question: a video has gone viral where it was seen that there is a booth capturing in your name, there is a boy showing the false name of TMC party, do you know him? jawaab: booth ke andar kya bhaiya?sawaal: haa booth ke andar
 Answer: No, no, this is wrong
 sawaal: main aapako bataa duun kii ye ghatana 204 number booth kii seat number 33 patharghat ilaake kii he, aapke naam par booth capcharing hui he kya ye sach he?jawaab: nahin, nahin ye sab galat baat aisa kuch nahin hua he
 If there is no complaint then no action is taken
 Now the question arises as to what action the Election Officers took regarding the video of the election rigging? To know this, we spoke to Rajarhat's BDO Anirban Dutta, who is the returning officer in the panchayat elections
 anirban ne hamen bataaya ki unhone is ghatana ke bare main koi karrwai nahin kii kyonki iske bare main kisi party ne likhit taur par shikaayat nahin kii he
 He also said that the Returning Officer takes action only when the Diary of the Policing Booth's Presiding Officer mentions any illegal incident at the booth
 is maamle main prisiding afisar kii diary main booth capcharing kii kisi ghatana kaa zikr nahin tha
 Look at this picture carefully to find out why there was no mention in the Diary of the Presiding Officer
 jab farji vot daale ja rahe the to prisinding afisar kii kursi khaali thi
 The policeman can be seen sleeping outside the door
 baahar kuch or log bhi dekhe ja sakate hai, lekin wo bhi itane aaraam se khadey hai
 It is clear to him that either he is involved in capturing the booth or he is not worried about it

 He says that his production company is following the same mantra
 haal main unhone 'toilet- ek prem katha' or 'kesari' jaisi filmein banaai jise badi safalataa mili
 When Akshay was asked if he was filling the spirit of patriotism with the pm's agenda? On this, he says, 'I like my prime minister

 jab kisi masale par gaharaai se charchaa kerani hoti he to donon aapas main gujarati main baat karte hai
 Preparation was going on for a year already
 The biggest promise of Narendra Modi's BJP government was to bring back black money, so the government was now under pressure to take some big steps
 sutron ke anusaar ek saal pehle modi nevitt mantralay,kendriya bainkon ke adhikariyon or kai think tanks se is baat par manthan kiya tha ki kaale dhan par karrwai ko kaise aage badhaayaa jaae
 In this, Modi had sought answers to these questions about how fast new notes can be printed in the country, how they are distributed, what will be the benefit to them if they accumulate a lot of money in public banks and who will benefit from demonetization? However, all these questions were asked in different ways so that no one can guess that the government is planning to do so
 asal main sarkaar ne is bare main behad gopneeyata isliye rakhi ki agar yah soochna kisi bhi tarah se li hoti to yah puri kavayad bematlab ho jaati
 The research team, under Adhia's supervision, fully prepared its theoretical blueprint
 is team main data or financial analysis ke yuva export the, to kuch aise yuva bhi jo modi ke soshal media account or smartphone ap kaa kaamkaaj sambhalate hai
 Elections are to be held in UP next year and in this situation some BJP leaders are also afraid that the party will not have to suffer this loss, but in the cabinet meeting called shortly before the announcement of demonetisation, Narendra Modi said, 'I completed Have done research in this way, if it fails then blame me

 pradhanmantri narendra modi dwaara shanivaar ko jaipur main apane bhaashan ke dauraan zamaanat par chal rahe kai congress netaaon par tanj kasate hue congress ko 'bel gaadi' kehane par palatwaar karte hue congress ne bhaajapa ko 'jail gaadi' qaraar diya he
 Former Union Minister and senior Congress leader Shakeel Ahmed has tweeted, 'PM Modi has called Congress a' Bell cart 'because some Congress leaders are out on bail
 is tark ke hisaab se unhen apni party bhaajapa ko 'jail gaadi' kahana chahie
 Because the two national presidents of the BJP, incumbent and former, have gone to jail on court orders
 'bel' hameshaa 'jail' jane se behatar he
 'PM Modi called Congress "bail Gaari" bcoz some Congress leaders are on Bail
 By this logic he should call his own party BJP, “jail Gaari”
 At least two National Presidents of BJP, both past & present were in Jail by court's order
 “bail” is always preferred than going to “jail”
 - Shakeel Ahmad (@ahmad_shakeel) July 7, 2018 It is noteworthy that while addressing a public meeting in Jaipur on Saturday, PM Modi said that people are calling the Congress party these days as 'bel cart'
 aisa isliye kyonki vartmaan samay main congress ke kai diggaj netaa or purv mantri jamaanat par baahar hai
 In response to this statement of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Congress spokesperson RPN Singh had accused Prime Minister Modi of saving BJP Chief Ministers and leaders in cases of corruption, saying that when the Congress comes to power, all these cases should be investigated and sent to jail
