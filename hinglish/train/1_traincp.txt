 uttar pradesh main samaajawaadee party adhyaksh akhilesh yadav (akhilesh Yadav) or mayawati (mayawati) kii bahujan samaaj party ke bich loksabhaa chunaav (lok Sabha Election 2019) ko lekar hue gathbandhan ke baad ab donon hi dal saat april ko ek badi raily karne ja rahe hai
 In this rally, both parties will show strength
 khaas baat yah he ki unhone is raily ke liesagaranpur ko chunaa he
 Explain that till 2014, this area was considered to be Mayawati
 basapa (BSP) kobite chaar chunaav main is sansadeey kshetra main do baar jeet mili thi
 But in 2014, he lost this seat due to Modi wave
 saharanpur kii kul aabaadi main se 42 fisadi jansankhya musalamaanon kii he
 While 22 percent people are Dalits
 akhilesh-mayawati ke gathbandhan kii pehali pariksha pashchimi upi main hone vaali he
 The slogan of this alliance is that they will not allow even a single vote, they will not let a single vote take place
 mayawati (mayawati) ke samarthak mukhya rup se jatav dalit matadaata hai, jo rajya main rahane vaale kul daliton kii aabaadi kii aadhi he
 In 2017, there was a shocking incident between upper caste and Dalits in a village in Saharanpur
 jisaki vajah se kuch samay baad ilaake main dange bhi bhadke
 This entire area was scorched in the heat of these riots for the next several weeks
 in dangon main do logon kii maut hui
 One of the dead was a Dalit and the other a Thakur
 dange ko dauraan daliton dwaara ek juluus ko roke jane ke khilaaf aropiyon ne 50 se zyada daliton ke gharon ko aag ke hawaale bhi kiya tha
 During that time, Chandrashekhar Ravan, chief of Bhima Army, was described as the main accused of the riots
 teen mahine baad upi police ne aaazaad ko himachal pradesh se giraftaar kiya
 The UP government had made several serious allegations against Azad for playing with the security of the nation
 haalanki baad main sarkaar ne un sabhi aaropon ko waapas bhi le liya tha
 Azad was released from prison 16 months after his arrest
 saharanpur hinsa or uske baad aaazaad ki giraftaar ke baad aaazaad kii badhati lokapriyata ko dekhte hue upi kii purv siem mayawati ghabara gayi
 He felt that this youth is now emerging as a new Dalit leader
 aaazaad ne 2015 main bhim army (bhim Army)kii sthapana kii
 After the establishment of Bhima Army, his initial objective was to provide better education to the children of the lower caste
 haalanki iske saath-saath yah sanghathan daliton kii aawaaj uthaane or daliton ke adhikaar ke liye ladane kii taiyaari main bhi tha
 At the same time, the incident of beating of Dalit youths in Una, Gujarat, was caused by beating
 or bhim army is ghatana ko pur jor virodh bhi kiya
 The Bhima Army is all set to play an active role in the elections
 sitambar maheene tak 'ravan' jail se reeha ho chukaa tha or uskaa siyaasi kad bad chukaa tha
 Especially in western Uttar Pradesh, where about half the seats of Mayawati's party come under the SP-BSP alliance
 mayawati apni umr se aadhe chandrashekhar ko lekar hameshaa se ashankit rahi hai
 Mayawati has been alleging that Chandrasekhar is an agent of the BJP, inspired by the ideology of the RSS
 wo kahati raheen hai ki agar chandrashekhar ko daliton ke prati vaaki main chintaa he to vah bhim army kii sthapana karne ke bajaay basapa main shaamil hote
 At the same time, Chandrashekhar Ravan told NDTV that during Modi and Yogi rule i was kept in jail for 16 months, 43 false cases were made against me
 chandrashekhar ne sawaal kiya ki kaise main us party kaa agent ho saktaa hum jo mujhe khatm karne kii koshish kar rahi he
 Regarding Mayawati's displeasure over meeting Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, Chandrasekhar said in a rally that i respect her very much and will never do such a thing that will harm the Dalit class
 lekin unhen mujh par vishwaas karnaa hoga
 Priyanka Gandhi and Chandrasekhar met in a hospital
 aaazaad ko ek raajnneetik juluus ke dauraan hiraasat main liya gaya tha
 Where he spoke of his health deteriorating, after which he was admitted to the hospital
 congress ne yah dikhaane kii koshish kii, akhilesh yadav or mayawati ke gathbandhan se baahar hone ke baad unke paas ek or karishmai dalit netaa he
 Azad also wanted to show that he is not a minor player
 saharanpur sthit ek vishvavidhyalay ke profasar khalid anis ansaari kehete hai ki pichley 2 saalon main chandrashekhar kii popularity dalit yuvaaon or muslimon ke bich teji se badi he jise uttar pradesh ke sheersh raajnneetik dal nazarandaaj nahin kar paae hai
 Perhaps this is why the Congress arrived to meet Chandrasekhar
 ek varisht congressi netaa ne enditivi se baatcheet main bataaya ki yah mulaakaat bhavishya ke liye ek nivesh kii tarah he
 He said that the party is looking for fresh faces in the North Assembly elections to be held in 2022
 in chunaavon ke liye bisapi or espi dwaara kiye gaye aitihaasik gathbandhan main shaamil hone sambhaavnaaen khatm hone ke baad congress dalit netaaon ko apane siyaasi daayre main laane kii koshish kar rahi he
 In this episode, Savitribai Phule was inducted into the Congress recently
 bispi ke kai bade netaa is baar chunaav nahin lard rahe hai kyonki unki siten akhilesh yadav ke hisse main chali gai he
 With the support of the opposition, Chandrasekhar wants to contest against PM Narendra Modi in Varanasi
 mayawati-akhilesh yadav ne gathbandhan main congress ko shaamil karne ko lekar pehle hi sabhi tarah kii atakalon ko khaarij kar diya he
 He believes that at present, the Congress has no base in the state and if he takes the Congress with him in this Lok Sabha election, it will weaken his fight against the BJP
 kuch samay pehle hi bhim army main shaamil hue manoj gautam kaa maananaa he ki agar chandreshekhar or congress ke bichapashchimi upi main kisi tarah kii baat banati he to iskaa khamiyaja bispi-sapagathabandhan ko bhugatna hoga
 He said that he has been voting for BSP before
 gautam april main hone vaali badi raily main shaamil honge
 He believes that Azad should ultimately support Mayawati
 gautam ne enditivi se kaha ki chandrashekhar ne kuch din pehle varanasi se piem modi ke khilaaf ladane kii ghoshnaa karne ke saath yah to saaf kar diya he ki unka makasad kya he
 It is known to all of us that PM Narendra Modi is the enemy of Dalits
 bijepi keshasan ke dauraan daliton kaa utpeedan band nahin hoga, jab tak ki use roka nahin jaataa
 If the aim of the BSP-SP alliance and Congress is the same, then they should support me
 unhone kaha ki apane iraade saaf karne ke baad chandrashekhar ne mayawati ko paanch baar phone kiya tha lekin unki taraf se ek baar bhi jawaab nahin mila
 Azad had said some time ago that he would continue to work as a social worker along with coming into active politics
 unhone enditivi se kaha ki aaazaad kaa aisa kehane ke peeche do kaaran hai
 One is the BJP leader's statement in which he pointed out that his party is preparing to change the constitution and the second reason is the atrocities committed by the BJP with the Dalits
 gautam ne kaha ki is saal farvari main piem modi ne varanasi ke sant ravidaas mandir kaa daura kiya tha
 i was also involved in the crowd present there
 maine dekha ki piem kii suraksha main lage logon ne kis tarah se hamaare dharmaguruon ko apamaanit kiya
 PM was outsider but we are devotees who were made to feel small in their own temple
 mayawati chandrashekhar par bijepi kaa agent hone kaa aarope lagaati rahi hai
 Azad will give a tough fight to PM Modi or will the opposition stand with him, there is no hope for the Bhim Army workers present in western UP
 lekin iske baavjood bhi vah aaazaad ke is bade faisle ke liye unhen apana puraa samarthan de rahe hai
 a college student said that upper caste people have been behaving vandalously with our leaders from the very beginning
 yah vahi log hai jinka sabhi raajnneetik partiyon main dakhal hota he
 The power has also corrupted Mayawati ji
 ab unamem or dusron main koi fark nahin rah gaya he
 Chandrasekhar is like a new hope
 aaazaad ne kaha ki bijepi ne 2014 ke aam chunaav main desh main anusuchit jatiyon ke liye arakshit 84 main se 66 siton par jeet darj kii thi
 These include a total of 17 seats in Yipu
 kul milakar main usee ummidavaar ko samarthan duungaa jo bijepi ko haraa paae
 Be it the Congress or the BSP-SP alliance

 com / b21wphqdjf — oneplus India (@oneplus_in) March 6, 2017 pehle rashtriya lok samta party ke netaa upendra kushvaha ko mukhyamantri pad ke daavedaar ke taur par elaan karne ke baad ab unki party ne bijepi leadership ke saamne kul 243 siton main se 68 siton par ladane kaa prastaav rakh diya he
 Speaking to NDTV India, the party's Principal Secretary and Chief Spokesperson Shivraj Singh said, 'we have proposed to the BJP that in the last assembly election in 2010, BJP contested 102 seats while LJP, which at that time had a separate alliance Together, she contested 74
 ab 243 main se baaki kii 67 siton par hamen chunaav ladane diya jaae
 'lok Janshakti Party is currently silent on the pull of seats
 in chunaavon main endie ke mukhyamantri pad ke ummidavaar kii pasand bijepi par chhod chuki lok janashakti party abhi siton ko lekar apane pattey kholane ko taiyaar nahin he
 The comments party ke netaa or saansad chiraag paswan ne enditivi se kaha, 'lok janashakti party main is mudde par abhi charchaa nahin shuru hui he
 Right now we are assessing the candidates
 darasal, bihar vidhansabha chunaavon main endie kii taraf se mukhyamantri pad kaa daavedaar koun ho, kis ghatak dal ko kitni siten di jaae ye sawaal pechida he or is par partiyon ke andar bhi aam raay nahin he
 Now it will be important to see how to deal with the political negotiation of BJP leadership partners
 enditivi india se baatcheet main party ke pradhan sachiv or mukhya pravaktaa shivaraj singh ne kaha, 'hamane bijepi ke saamne ye prastaav rakhaa he ki 2010 main pichley vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi ne 102 seat par chunaav ladaa tha jabaki algepi, jo us vakt alag gathvandhan ke saath thi, usne 74 par chunaav ladaa tha
 Now let us contest the remaining 67 seats out of 243
 ' siton kii khinchataan par lok janashakti party philhal chup he
 The Lok Janshakti Party, which has left the choice of nda's chief ministerial candidate in these elections, is not ready to open its cards with seats
 tippaniyan Party leader and MP Chirag Paswan told NDTV, 'discussion on this issue has not yet started in the Lok Janshakti Party
 abhi to ham ummidavaaron kaa akalan kar rahe hai
 In fact, the question of who should be the chief ministerial candidate from the NDA in Bihar assembly elections, how many seats should be given to which constituent party, is a complicated question and there is no consensus among the parties
 ab ye dekhnaa ahm hoga ki bijepi leadership sahyogiyon ke raajnneetik mol-tol se kaise nipatni he

 Today, the Foreign Secretaries of India and Pakistan will meet at Hyderabad House in Delhi
 dono ke bich confidence building megers par charchaa hogi
 Later the Foreign Secretaries of both countries will meet and discuss

 See in pictures, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will visit India once again after two and a half months, Foreign Secretary of India and Pakistan
 donon is baar dilli ke hyderabad house main milenge
 There will be a discussion between the two on various issues so that the new base of Pakistan, coming on a visit to India, can be made the basis of dialogue between the young Foreign Minister Heena Rabbani and SM Krishna
 sutron ke mutabik sachiv str vaarta main 26 / 11 kii jaanch main teji laane kii baat bharat pakistan se kahegaa
 India will not talk about the 13 / 7 terror attack yet because the cross-border relationship of this attack has not been proved till now
 hillari-krishna baatcheet main aatank ahm muddmerica main rahakar iesai ke paise se kashmir par propaganda failaane vaale gulam nabi fai kaa maamla bhi bharat pakistan ke saamne rakhega
 India does not like the program of Pak Foreign Minister Heena Rabbani to meet the Hurriyat leaders of Kashmir, so there will be talk about this too
 cross-elosi-sibiem jisamen srinagar-mujaffarabad bas seva kii frequence badhaane or elosi ke ird-gird vyapaar ke din badhaane par charchaa hogi
 Apart from security, trade, hydrologism and Siachen, new areas to enhance relations between the two countries will also be discussed
 27 july ko videsh mantri milenge or sachiv str par nirdhaarit vishyon par baat karengen taaki aane vaale samay main dono deshon ke bich rishton kii rekha ko spasht kar saken
 Similarly, Heena has realized her stand before coming to India
 dekhen kya kaha hillari clinton ne
 
 
 Heena Rabbani, 34, belongs to the influential political family of Pakistani Punjab
 unke pita or chachaa kaa punjab kii raajnneeti main tagada dakhal he
 Heena, who has done her bsc Honors in Management Science from Lahore University in 1999, has a Hotel Management degree from Massachusetts University of America
 parvej musharraf or jaradaari kii sarkaar main shaamil rahanaa unke siyaasi rasookh ko darshata he
 If Pakistan, which is going through its most fragile phase on the foreign front, has given the reins of foreign relations in the hands of the youngest foreign minister, then the country will definitely have confidence in his understanding and personality

 com / j78vd30why — indianpremierleague (@IPL) May 1, 2015 notebandi elaan par uthe ek sawaal ke jawaab main kendra sarkaar ne supreme court se kaha he pradhanmantri narendra modi kii spich kanoon se badi nahin he
 The Attorney General of the Government of India, Mukul Rohatgi told the court on Tuesday that the deadline of December 30 is according to the law after the announcement of demonetisation
 vahiin is taarikh ko 31 disambar karne kaa piem modi kaa vaada is kanoon se bada nahin he
 This question is raised by a petition before the bench of the Supreme Court
 is yachika main kendra sarkaar or rigerv bank paranotbandi kii ghoshnaake vakt kiye gaye vaade se mukarne kaa aarope he
 The Supreme Court issued notice to both the Central Government and the Reserve Bank seeking an answer in the case
 ek yachikakartaon ne puraani karency jamaa karne par penalty ke praavdhaan par sawaal uthaate hue court se guhaar lagaai thi ki piem modi ne 8 november 2016 ko notebandi kaa elaan karte vakt apni spich main vaada kiya tha
 In the decision of demonetisation, the deadline for depositing the banned currency till December 30, 2016 was fixed in the bank
 lekin piem modi ne vaada kiya tha ki jo naagarik kisi kaaran se is avadhi tak apane paas rakhi pratibandhit karency ko jamaa nahin kara paata, use 31 march 2017 tak rigerv bank main yah karency jamaa karaane kaa mauka milegaa
 After the announcement of demonetisation, Reserve Bank also said in its circular that the old currency can be deposited in the Reserve Bank by 31 March
 haalanki usne rigerv bank main jamaa karaane waalon ko yah vajah bataane kii shart rakh di thi ki kyon ukt karency ko 30 disambar 2016 kii dedline tak nahin jamaa karaayaa gaya
 a bench headed by Chief Justice Jagdish Singh Khehar has fixed the next hearing for April 11 in the case
 court main bench ne yachikakarta se yah jaankaree bhi maangi ki kya vah notebandi kii tay miyaad 30 disambar 2016 tak bharat main nahin the
 At the same time, the court has also asked the government why the central government did not allow the citizens to deposit the restrictive currency till 31 March 2017

 Friday marks 20 years of the Kargil war
 is ladaai main bharat ne pakistan ko dhul chataa di thi or kargil kii pahari par chadhe pakistani javaanon ko khaded diya tha
 On the one hand, where today India is celebrating the completion of 20 years of this war, in the meantime, let us tell you how Pakistan had conspired to capture Kargil
 pakistan is plan ko 1984 main lagu karnaa chahta tha lekin 1999 main kar paaya
 Pakistan's famous journalist Najam Sethi narrated the entire story in an interview to the Pakistani channel
 nazam sethi ke anusaar, is mudde par hindustan main kai tarah kii kitaaben likhi gai hai lekin pakistan main kaaphi kam kitaab likhi gai hai
 He told that in 1984 when Pakistan was ruled by General zia-ul-haq, India occupied the Siachen hills
 lekin jiya ul haq ne desh main is baat ko nahin bataaya kyonki unhen lagata tha ki aise main unke khilaaf desh main gussa penpega
 But then his DGMO told Jia ul Haq a plan and said that we can take back Siachen
 DGMO ke mutabik, agar ham siachin waapas lete hai to usamen dikkat nahin hogi
 Because the way Hindustan occupied winter, we can also do so in the next winter
 jiya ul haq ne poocha ki kya bharat palatwaar nahin karegaa
 Nazam Sethi says that the DGMO explained that if we go to Siachen, there may be firing on Kashmir border, in such a situation, we can provoke Mujahideen there
 lekin jiya ul haq ko ye plan pasand nahin aayaa or maamla tal gaya
 According to Pakistani journalist Nazam Sethi, Pervez Musharraf was the Army Chief in Pakistan when it came to 1999
 or unka ek group tha jis ‘gang of for’ kaha jaataa he
 Apart from Pervez Musharraf, it included General Aziz (head of Kashmir Territory), General Mahmood and Brig Javed Hassan
 nazam sethi ne bataaya ki in chaar logon ne plan tab banaaya jab 1998 main navaj sharif-atal bihari vaajapeyi bas sarvice kii shuruyaat karne vaale the, lekin parvej musharraf ko ye manjuur nahin tha
 The Gang of Four then decided to proceed with his plan
 pakistani patrkaar ne intervyuu main kaha ki oktober 1998 main inhone plan ko manjuuri di, janvari 1999 main 200 logon ko training dekar upar bhejne ko kaha gaya
 Earlier, the target was that 10 posts of India would be occupied, but when it went up, the whole area was empty and later more people were called
 nazam sethi ke mutabik, bharat ko may main shaq hua tha or baad main unhone bhi atake kiya

 Earlier, the Congress President had attacked the Defense Minister Sitharaman over the Rafael Deal
 rahul gandhi ne rafel vimaan saude kaa theka sarkari upkram hindustan aironautics limited (echeel) ko nahin die jane par raksha mantri ko apane nishane par liya
 Rahul tweeted this and accused Nirmala of 'lying'

 Posting the news on Twitter related to the statement of former HAL chief TS Raju, Gandhi said, "the lie of RM (rafael Minister), who is working to protect corruption, has been caught once again
 echeel ke purv pramukh ties raju ne unke is jhooth kii kalai khol di he ki echeel ke paas rafel banane kii kshamta nahin he
 Every day new things and new allegations are coming out on the Rafale issue
 aise main aaie jaanate hai ki is deal main kab kya hua
 - In the year 2007, a proposal was sent to the Government to purchase Medium Multi Role Combat Aircraft (MMRCA) by the Air Force
 iske baad bharat sarkaar ne 126 ladaaku vimaanon ko kharidne kaa tender jari kiya
 After this, the fighters to buy were Boeing f / A-18 Super Hornet of America, Dassault Rafale of France, Eurofighter of Britain, Lockheed Martin F-16 Falcon of America, Mikhayan MIG-35 of Russia and Saab of Sweden Aircraft such as the JAS-39 Gripen were included
 haalanki, Dassault aviation ke rafel ne baaji maari
 - On 4 September 2008, Reliance Group formed a new company called Reliance Aerospace Technologies Limited (RATL)
 iske baad RATL or Dassault ke bich baatcheet hui or joint venture banane par sahmati ban gai
 The aim was to get all the agreements between India and France in the future
 - may 2011 main air force nerafelaur euro fiter jetts ko short listed kiya
 - In January 2012, the tender for buying Rafael was made public
 is par rafel ne sabase kam dar par vimaan uplabdh karaane ko boli lagaai
 According to the conditions, India had to buy 126 fighter aircraft
 inamen se 18 ladaaku vimaanon taiyaar haalat main dene kii baat thi, jabaki baaki 108 vimaan Dassault kii madad se hindustan aironautics limited (HAL) dwaara taiyaar kiya janaa tha
 However, during this time there was no final agreement between India and France on the price of these aircraft and the time of starting the process of making them
 - 13 march 2014 tak rafel vimaanon kii keemat, technology, vepan system, customijeshan or inke rakh rakhaav ko lekar baatcheet jari rahi
 Also HAL and Dassault Aviation signed an agreement to make it
 - upie shasankaal main rafel ko kharidne kii deal ko antim rup nahin diya ja sakaa
 Although the Congress party claims that it has 526
 1 karod rupye prati rafel vimaan kii dar se deal kii thi
 It was not clear whether Dassault would make these aircraft available in due time as per India's requirements
 isaki vajah yah he ki upie shasankaal main yah deal puri nahin hui thi
 After this, the NDA came to power and on 28 March 2015, reliancedefense Company was formed under the leadership of Anil Ambani
 - 10 april 2015 ko piem modi ne france kii rajdhani paris kaa daura kiya or udaan ke liye taiyaar 36 rafel ladaaku vimaan kharidne ke apni sarkaar ke faisle kaa elaan kiya
 During this, he said that it is very important for the Indian Air Force to buy these aircraft
 - june 2015 main raksha mantralay ne 126 aircraft kharidne kaa tender nikaala
 - In December 2015, Reliance Entertainment invested 1
6 million euros in the movie production of Julie Guyet, partner of the then French President Hollande
 france ke akhbaar media part ke mutabik yah nivesh france ke ek vyakti ke investment fund ke jariye kiya gaya, jo ambani ko pichley 25 varshon se jaanata tha
 However, Julie Gayet's production Rogue International rejected talks about meeting Anil Ambani or representatives of Reliance
 - sitambar 2016 ko bharat or france ke bich 36 rafel vimaan kharidne kii final deal par dastakhat hue
 The price of these aircraft is 7
 87 billian euro rakhi gai
 According to this deal, delivery of these aircraft is said to start from September 2018
 - farvari 2017 ko Dassault Reliance Aerospace Ltd (DRAL) joint venture ko gathit kiya gaya
 During this time, the Congress alleged that the Modi government bypassed the HAL and gave the deal to Anil Ambani's Reliance
 is par reliance dephence limited ke siio rajesh dhingra ne safai dete hue kaha ki unki company ko joint venture contreks sidhe Dassault se mila or isamen sarkaar kaa koi role nahin tha
 - In the midst of a furore over the Rafale Deal on September 2018, now François Hollande made a new disclosure
 french akhbaar ko die intervyuu main unhone kaha he ki anil ambani kii reliance dephence kaa naam khud bharat sarkaar ne sujhaayaa tha
 Although the French government and Dassault have avoided this, the allegations of opposition have been strengthened

 In the Narendra Modi government, the real force that drives any work related to the field of urban development is 'competition'
 swatchta, kachra prabandhan or khule main shouch rokane ke prayaason ke liye ranking or grad dene ke saath kendriya awaas or shahari maamalon kaa mantralay shaharon or rajyon ke bich pratispardhaa kii bhaavana paidaa karne kii koshish main sabase aage rahaa he
 There is a competition among various cities to be included in the list of top-10 cleanest cities of the country
 vahiin rajya khule main shouch mukt rajya kaa tag hasil karne ke liye jor laga rahe hai
 For these competitions, the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs like Smart Cities Mission, Atal Renewal and Urban Transformation Mission (AMRUT), Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, Heritage City Development and Extension Scheme (hriday) and Pradhan Mantri Awas yojana-urban (PMAY-U) The plans decorate the main stage

 Union Housing and Urban Affairs Minister Hardeep Singh Puri insists that these achievements are not only on paper but can be seen on the ground

 swatantra paryvekshak is se sahmati jataate hai ki shahari vikaas ke kshetra main mahatvapurn kaary hue hai
 Srikanth Vishwanathan, chief executive officer of the Janagraha Center for Citizenship and Democracy, says, "the government has raised the decisive levels associated with the rejuvenation of cities and has also made significant efforts to meet the targets
 sarkaar ne apane har prayaas ke saath kuch mahatvakankshi lakshya bhi nirdhaarit kiye hai
 "however, the speed of the projects and progress of the ground work under the Smart City has lagged far below the desired level
 phir bhi visheshgyon kaa kahana he ki mishan ne pratispardhi model ke jariye shaharon or unke hitdharakon ke bich is soch ko viksit karne main kamyaabi hasil kii he ki 21veen sadi ke ek shahar ke liye kya kiya janaa chahie or iske maanak paimaane ko upar uthaaya he
 Private sector participation in the development of urban infrastructure has increased more and more interest and has shown the way to raise capital for resources through municipal bonds
 vishvanathan kehete hai, ''centre kii bajaay hamen pariyojnaon ke liye rajya sarkaron or nagarpalikaon ko javabdeh bananaa chahie
 "but what urban planners hold central government responsible for is the negligible improvement in the governance structure of urban local bodies
 centre for policy research ke varisht sahyogi parth mukhopadhyaay kehete hai, ''jab tak shahari sthaneey nikaayon ko shashakt sthaneey sarkaar nahin banaaya jaataa, tab tak shahari paridrishy main koi bada badlaav nahin ho saktaa
 "they attribute the ambiguity of governance in urban local bodies to the lethargy in the Smart Cities Mission
 ve kehete hai, ''nirvaachit sthaneey sarkaar kii bajaay vishesh uddeshy bal (espivi) ke jariye smart city mishan ke karyanvayan kaa prayaas shahari sthaneey nikaayon ko or kamjor karata he
 In practice this has caused considerable tension at the ground level which impeded implementation
 kai espivi rajya sarkaar ke naukarshahon kii atirikt jimmedaari hai jo unki prabhaavashiltaa ko kam karata he or espivi ke prabandhan ke liye baahar se visheshgyata laane kii sambhaavnaaon main baadhak he
 "although the primary responsibility for improving the administration of the city rests with the state governments, Viswanathan says that the Center can play the role of a catalyst

 sachin tendulkar jaise mahaan khilaadi ke liye itihaas ne ek baar phir se khud ko doharaaya
 As the Mumbai Indians team won the IPL title on Sunday, the young players made the rounds of the Eden Gardens Stadium by sitting Sachin on the shoulder
 isi tarah kaa najaara do saal pehle vankhede stadium main dekhne ko mila tha
 In 2011, when the Indian cricket team won the ICC World Cup (50 overs) title after 28 years under the leadership of Mahendra Singh Dhoni, many members of the team made the rounds of the stadium with Sachin sitting on his shoulder and now while Mumbai Indians While he won the IPL title in the sixth attempt, his younger teammates respected him in the same way
 sachin ke liye vakt eden main tham gaya tha
 He may not have played in the finals but his face changes with changing circumstances like any other player
 vah puure match ke dauraan utane hi sakriy najar aae, jitne kii antim-ekadash main shaamil khilaadi the
 Sachin could not play in qualifier-1, qualifier-2 and final because of injury
 lagbhag 10 din pehle sunrisers hyderabad ke saath hue lig match ke dauraan sachin ritred hart ho gaye or uske baad unhone ipel main ek bhi match nahin khelaa
 Sachin achieved everything in his 20-year-long career
 anekon ricard apane naam kar chuke sachin ke sakriy rahete hue bhartiya or unki club tiimon ne twanti-20 vishwa cap (vah haalanki team ke sadsy nahin the), 50 over vishwa cap, ipel khitaab or test variyata kram main pehla sthaan hasil kiya
 Thus, two years ago, Sachin's bag of titles is now fully filled
 tippaniyan Thinking this, Sachin announced that he will no longer play in the IPL
 sachin ne antarrashtriya twanti-20 cricket khelaa hi nahin
 He has just one match to his name but the IPL gave Sachin an opportunity to be fit for competitive cricket by playing for two consecutive months
 vah ek-divasiy cricket se sanyas le chuke hai or peshewar twanti-20 lig bhi chhod diya
 Now he will only be seen playing for India in Test matches
 iskaa matlab yah he ki ab cricket premiyon ko sachin ko khelte dekhne ke bahut kam maukey milenge

 sachin chot ke kaaran kwalifire-1, kwalifire-2 or fainal main nahin khel sake
 Sachin retired retired during the league match with Sunrisers Hyderabad about 10 days ago and after that he did not play a single match in the IPL
 sachin ne apane 20 saal se bhi lambe kariyar main sab kuch hasil kiya
 With many records to his name, Sachin was active and the Indian and his club teams took first place in the Twenty20 World Cup (though he was not a member of the team), the 50-over World Cup, the IPL title and the Test order
 is tarah do saal pehle tak khitaabon se sukhi sachin kii jholii ab puri tarah bhar chuki he
 The comments yahi sochakar sachin ne ghoshnaa kii ki vah ab ipel main nahin khelenge
 Sachin did not play international Twenty20 cricket
 unke naam sirf ek match darj he lekin ipel ne sachin ko lagaataar do maheenon tak khelte hue khud ko pratispardhi cricket ke liye feet rahane kaa mauka diya
 He retired from one-day cricket and also left the professional Twenty20 league
 ab vah sirf test maichon main bharat ke liye khelte dikhenge
 This means that now cricket fans will get very few chances to see Sachin play

 In contrast, the other national party BJP is in power in 19 states of the country

 This is a recent achievement for the unbeatable pair of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP President Amit Shah, who have managed to form BJP governments in 16 states since the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 phir bhi, congress adhyaksh 2019 main modi ko chunauti dene kii khwaahish paale baithe hai
 The defeat of Karnataka is a sign that the Congress has either not taken a particular lesson from the last several defeats or has been lax in implementing the lesson it has taken
 congress ke kendriya netritv kaa chunaav ke purv or chunaav ke baad kaa najariya iskaa ek udhaaharan he
 On the day when the Karnataka election results were declared, that afternoon, UPA President Sonia Gandhi reached Rahul Gandhi's government residence in Delhi
 yah is baat kaa sanket he ki congress kaa sheersh netritv us din kis kadar chintit tha
 They did not want to repeat Goa, Manipur and Meghalaya, where the BJP was quick to form an alliance to get a majority figure

 Senior party leaders in the state also wanted the Congress to form a pre-poll alliance with the JD (S), but Rahul had given Siddaramaiah complete leeway

 On Saturday, the score on which PM Modi's inning ended, on Sunday, with that score, Modi started further batting
 agle din modi zyada tej or zyada aakraamak hokar khele
 This inning of Modi reminded Chakravyuh of Mahabharata
 piem ke road sho main jansailabadarasal ye 40 siton ke chakravyuuh kaa wo aakhri darwaja he jisapar khud pradhanmantri modi khadey he
 The Prime Minister's door-to-door campaign of PM continued in Varanasi for the second day
 modi ke is veekend mega sho par kaashi main gajab kii garmi dikhi
 On the second day, Modi's roadshow started at Pandeypur intersection
 hukulganj, chaukaghat, taeliabag-patel dharmashala, singh medical chauraahaa se kaashi viapeeth tak modi kaa kafila chalaa
 PM Modi spoke on the opposition in Kashi Vidyapeeth, Modi reached Varanasi by helicopter in the afternoon and after 20 minutes his convoy was passing through the streets of Kashi
 road sho kii bheed bataa rahi thi ki bijepi ke campan manageron kaa ground work thikthak rahaa
 a large number of supporters were seen cheering BJP
 chaar ghante tak modi kii kaashi parikrama chalati rahi
 The climax of the second round of the roadshow took place at Kashi Vidyapeeth where the PM rallied and made some fresh attacks on akhilesh-rahul
 achche din ke aas, kaashi ke saathkashi viapeeth vishvavidhyalay maidan main jansabha ko sambodhit karte hue modi ne kaha, 'pichhali sarkarein banaras ke vikaas ko lekar sirf tikadam karti rahi hai or unka uddeshy sirf chunaav jeetna rahaa he
 But these tactics did not help Benares
 banaras ke aadhunikeekaran, iske kayakalp kii jarurat he or meraa sapana he ki banaras ko ek vishwastareey aadhunik shahar main tabdeel kar duun
 Modi said that the people of Banaras can make this city the city of the world's imagination, for this only the obstacles have to be removed
 kaashi se piem modi kaa 'apnaapan'modi ne kaha, 'logon kii jivan main kam se kam ek baar banaras ghoomane kii ichha hoti he, kyonki banaras koi shahar nahin he, balki ek jiti jaagti viraasat he'
 The PM said, 'SP, BSP, Congress used to do evil to each other, but all three got together on one thing
 8 november raat jab unhone notebandi kaa faisla liya'
 The PM said that he who looted the country for 70 years will now have to return it
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki akhilesh ne upi main vot ke hisaab se naaptul kar kaam kiya
 a victory in Varanasi is essential for BJP PM Modi has been in Kashi for two days
 ravivaar kii raat bhi pradhanmantri varanasi main hi bithaayenge
 PM Modi seems intent on fixing the record of 2012, as Varanasi is his parliamentary seat, because in 2012 BJP won only three out of 8 seats, because if there was not a clean sweep here then it would be said that the public faces the PM i did not listen to other issues
 isliye piem yahaan date hai or aap kah sakate hai ki kaashi ko kantavihin banane ke liye modi ne yahaan khud ko jhonk diya
 In response to PM Modi's mega show, akhilesh-rahul are also engaged in pitching on Purvanchal's pitch
 donon ne ravivaar ko purvanchal main teen-teen reliyaan kii
 Akhilesh Rahul Gandhi will have high hopes from the sizeable population of minorities in the eight seats of Varanasi
 varanasi ke musalamaanon ke liye bhi ye kam ahm chunaav nahin he
 PM Modi likes winning in Kashi
 lekin kaashi kii jeet upi jite bagaiyr kargar nahin ho paaegi
 Winning UP is also necessary for Modi for many of his ministers
 isliye modi cabinet ke darjan bhar mantriyon kaa deraa-danda bhi yaheen jamaa he
 The BJP MLA is still angry with the ticket being cut, despite all the efforts of the BJP, she cannot consider Kashi as safe
 varanasi dakshin seat se saat baar vidhayak rahe shyamdev raay choudhary ke dil kaa dard abhi bharaa nahin he
 PM Modi's ointment itself also did not work
 upi ke nateezon se modi ke kai cabinet mantriyon ke janaadhar kaa bhi test ho jayega
 8 Union ministers including PM are from UP and victory and defeat will determine where they stand in the public eye
 -modi khud varanasi se loksabhaa saansad hai jahaan aath vidhansabha siten hai, 3 bijepi ke paas he, 1 apana dal ke paas, 2 bispi ke paas, ek-ek seat congress-espi ke kabje main he
 Rajnath Singh is a Lok Sabha MP from Lucknow, where 9 assembly seats, 7 sps, 1 BJP, 1 Congress
 -uma bharti jhaansi se loksabhaa saansad hai, jahaan chaar vidhansabha seat he, 2 espi ke paas, 1 bijepi ke paas, 1 bispi ke paas he
 Kalraj Mishra is a Lok Sabha MP from Deoria, where there are seven assembly seats, 5 sps, 1 BJP, 1 Congress
 -manoj sinha gajipur se loksabhaa chunaav jite
 In 2012, out of the 7 seats here, 6 sp's and 1 Quami went to the unity party
 -menka gandhi kii loksabhaa seat pilibhit kii 4 vidhansabha siton main se 3 par espi kaa or 1 par bijepi kaa kabja he
 Santosh is from Gangwar Bareilly, where there are 9 assembly seats, 3 BJP, 3 SP, 2 BSP, 1 IEMC
 -shahjahanpur kii saansad krishna raaj ke sansadeey kshetra main 6 vidhansabha seat he, 3 par espi kaa, 2 par bispi kaa or 1 par bijepi kaa kabja he
 All these ministers also have the support of Modi's name and Modi's work, so if PM Modi is campaigning in UP, then it is also good for the health of these ministers

 Rahul Raj, an accused in the suicide case of TV actress Pratyusha Banerjee, broke his silence for the first time and made serious allegations against Pratyusha's parents about the daughter's money
 jabaki pratyusha kii maa shoma banerjee or pita ramesh banerjee ne aise sabhi aaropon ko khaarij kiya he
 In a special conversation with Aaj Tak, the parents of the actress said, 'whatever allegations have been made, all are wrong
 bank statement se clear ho jayega ki kisne paisa nikaala
 In the early days we had a joint account
 baad main sirf maa ke saath acount tha
 Pratyusha's father said that if the parents do not handle the children's money then who will do it
 'unamem aksar marpet hoti thi'rahul rajpar palatwaar karte hue shoma banerjee ne kaha, 'hamaari bacchee ko bhi daraaya jaataa tha or ye baat aakhri kol se saaf he
 Once Rahul's friend Saloni Sharma also assaulted Pratyusha
 saloni ne maar-maar par pratyusha ko behosh kar diya tha
 From there, the shopkeeper told us that there is often a fight
 ' shoma banerjee ne kaha ki mumbai main aisa mahaul banaaya gaya ki hamen waapas janaa padaa
 'police is not telling us anything', Pratyusha's mother further said, 'whatever this boy is saying that we took money is wrong
 ' shoma banerjee ne kaha ki police unhen kuch nahin bataa rahi
 Not only this, he was also not allowed to go where Pratyusha died
 abhinetri kii maa ne kaha, 'last ghar jahaan ve rah rahe the, vah meraa agreement tha
 Then he went away from there
 jo 1
 5 lakh was an advance deposit, that too Rahul had made a check in the name of Pratusha
 kamya se paise kii baat bhi juthi he
 Talk of defamation is being intimidated so that people do not come forward
 ''roj sunati hum beti kaa gaanaa'shoma banerjee ne kaha ki vah roj beti kii tasviir dekhati hai or uskaa gaaya gaanaa sunati hai
 He said, 'today is Mother's Day
 roj subah uski photo dekhati hum
 i listen to her song at night
 vah bahut acha gaati thi
 i sleep only after this 'shaadishuda he rahul'pita ramesh banerjee ne kaha ki antim phone kol se yah saaf ho gaya ki rahulpratyusha ko kitna pareshaan karata tha
 He said, 'rahul first married Heer Patel
 agar wo kah rahaa he ki vah shaadishuda nahin he to galat kah rahaa he
 We believe in the law, but carelessness is being done somewhere
 'rahul bolaa- pratyusha se aaj bhi karata hum pyargauratlab he ki isse pehle rahul ne puure maamle main pehali baar chuppi todate hue kaha tha ki vah aaj bhi pratyusha se behad pyaar karte hai
 Rahul said, 'pratyusha's parents did not accuse me at first, when some people seduced them and then they dragged my name in this matter
 main pratyusha se sachcha pyaar karata tha, aaj bhi karata hum
 i have no hand behind Pratyusha's suicide and this will be clear in the investigation
 'pratyusha ke mata-pita se paison ko lekar puche sawalpratyusha ke mata-pita kaa kathghare main khadey karte hue rahul ne sawaal uthaaya ki pratyusha ne pichley 4-5 saalon main kareeb 5 karod rupee kamaaye
 But there is no property in his name, where did all his money go? According to Rahul, Pratyusha had taken a loan from the bank, which she was not able to pay EMI
 rahul kii maane to pratyusha kahati thi ki uskaa acount uski mummy manage karti thim
 At the same time, Rahul said that Pratyusha used to take all the expenses from the rent of Jamshedpur house along with her expenses
 hitech pradhanmantri
 
 
 Yes, the same can be said for Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 desh main ab tak jitne bhi pradhanmantri hue hai, unamem modi kaamkaaj main technology kaa sabase adhik istemaal karne vaale pradhanmantri kahe ja sakate hai
 Modi uses mobile technology not only for his official work but also in election campaigning
 pradhanmantrine 17 june 2017 ko namo ap lonch kiya tha
 In the beginning, everyone felt that from this app, information of government's achievements, schemes or programs of the Prime Minister can be taken
 saath hi is ap ke jariye piem modi ko sidhe sandesh bhi diya ja saktaa he or sarkaar ke kaamkaaj ke bare main feedback bhi, lekin kisi ko is baat kaa andaja nahin tha ki piem modi is ap se video conferencing ke jariye aam logon se sidhe samvaad bhi kar sakate hai
 PM Modi spoke through audio-video conferencing with 3,000 people, including all BJP Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha mps, BJP mlas in all states, party's national and state officials, last month before the election campaign
 iskaa jo respons aayaa usko dekhte hue piem modi or party ne tay kiya ki ap kii takanic kaa upyog karnataka chunaav prachaar main bhi kiya jayega
 First, PM Modi spoke on 26 April through video conferencing with all 224 party candidates in Karnataka, party's Lok sabha-rajya Sabha mps from Karnataka, state and district office bearers and booth managers through the Namo app
 iske baad 2 may kopiem modine karnataka kisaan morcha ke 4 lakh sadasyon ke saath sidhe samvaad kiya
 Now Prime Minister Modi is going to communicate with one lakh women of Karnataka Mahila Morcha through Namo app
 aane vaale dino main ve karnataka yuva morcha, SC or ST morcha ke saath bhi samvaad karenge
 1 million downloads Amit Malviya, the convener of the IT cell of BJP, says that till date almost one crore people have downloaded this app
 jab-jab piem modi ap ke jariye party ke kaaryakartaaon ke saath samvaad karte he us din lagbhag 2 lakh se 2
 5 lakh people download the app
 malviya kaa ye bhi kahana hai pichley teen maheene main 20 lakh se zyaada logon ap downlod kiya hai
 Modi used to campaign in more than a hundred places simultaneously through 3D screens in 2012 and 2014
 2019 kaa chunaav aane se pehle piem modi ne ap ke zariye karnataka main prachaar kii is technology se nai line khinch di hai
 Modi has no qualms in shocking opponents on one occasion during the campaign
 beete saal gujarat main chunaav prachaar ke aakhri din jis tarah ‘si plane’kaa istemaal kiya tha, wo sabhi ke liye hairaan karne vaala tha
 On the occasion of Women's Day, Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulated all the women on this day
 piem modi is maukey par aaj rajasthan main ek raily ko bhi sambodhit karenge
 PM remembered Kunwar Bai on the occasion of Women's Day
 kunwar bai kaa haal hi main kuch samay pehle nidhan ho gaya tha
 He was also praised by Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the work done for Swachh Bharat Abhiyan
 chhattisgarh kii swatchta doot raheen kunwar bai ne bakriyaan bech kar apane gaanv main shauchalay banavaane kaa kaam kiya tha
 When PM Modi met him, he touched his feet and took his blessings
 i will always cherish the time when i had the opportunity to seek Kunwar Bai’s blessings during one of my visits to Chhattisgarh
 Kunwar Bai lives on in the hearts and minds of all those who are passionate towards fulfilling Bapu's dream of a clean India

 The ruling BJP at the center is engaged in besieging the opposition Congress under the pretext of emergency
 june 1975 main lagaaya gaya apatkaal shaayad congress kii sabase badi bhul thi jiskaa dansh ajtak party jhel rahi he
 During this time, all the opposition leaders were put in jail under the MISA Act, ranging from former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee to Lal Krishna Advani, Arun Jaitley, Ravi Shankar Prasad
 misa kanoon saal 1971 main lagu kiya gaya tha lekin iskaa istemaal apatkaal ke dauraan congress virodhiyon, patrakaron or saamaajik kaaryakartaaon ko jail main daalane ke liye kiya gaya
 The Misa, the Internal Security System Act, made several amendments during the Emergency and Indira Gandhi's autocratic government acted to crush its political opponents
 misa bandiyon se bhari jelenmisa or diarai ke tahat ek lakh se zyada logon ko giraftaar kiya gaya
 During the Emergency, there was a flood of MISA prisoners in the jails
 naagarik adhikaar pehle hi khatm kiye ja chuke the or phir is kanoon ke jariye suraksha ke naam par logon ko pratadit kiya gaya, unki sampatti chhini gai
 The change was made so stringent that the prisoners had no hearing in the judiciary
 kai bandi to aise bhi the jo puure 21 maheene ke apatkaal ke dauraan jail main hi kaid rahe

 mujhe yah mahasoos nahin hua ki main 22 saal kii umr main un ghatnaon main shaamil ho rahaa tha jo itihaas kaa hissaa banane ja rahi thim
 This incident changed the future of my life
 shaam tak, main tihaad jail main misa bandi ke taur par band kar diya gaya tha
 As soon as the Emergency came into force, a list of such people was to be arrested
 is list main sabase pehla naam jaiprakash narayan or morarji desai kaa tha
 Indira's younger son Sanjay Gandhi was entrusted with the task of preparing this list
 subah hoti isse pehle hi jepi or morarji desai ko misa ke tahat jail main daal diya gaya

 "" Despite the provision of reservation in the recruitment of other backward class students and teachers in the country's prestigious Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), accusations are being made by the administration for not making enough efforts to fill these places whereas jnu's Rector Prof r Kumar said that there is no merit in these allegations
 obisi sampark adhikari ne kiya khulusajeenyu ko obisi aarakshan lagu karne ke liye kendra sarkaar kii ore se vittiya anudaan to muhaiyaa kara diya gaya he lekin chaatr sanghathanon or vishvavidhyalay ke obisi sampark adhikari kaa kahana he ki paatr vyaktiyon ko 27 fisadi ke is aarakshan se maharoom rakhane ke liye ji-tod koshish kii ja rahi hai jabaki is varg ko saamaanya varg kii hakmaari ke bina aarakshan pradaan karne ke liye uniwarsity kii siton main ijapha bhi kiya gaya he
 The administration argued to follow the rules of the court
 r Kumar said that the JNU administration will follow the guidelines of the Hon'ble Supreme Court to fill the vacant OBC category seats
 ucchtam nyaayalay ne apane haal ke disha-nirdesh main kaha he ki khaali rah gayi obisi varg kii siton ko saamaanya varg ke ummidavaaron se bharaa janaa chahie
 The benefit of OBC reservation in the recruitment of teachers is not there, while OBC Liaison Officer in JNU Pramod Kumar Yadav wrote a letter to the Director of Personnel and Training Department of the Center in which he has raised the issue of not giving OBC reservation in the recruitment of teachers in JNU
 unhone likhaa he ki jeenyu main professor or associat professor ke pad par obisi aarakshan nahin diya ja rahaa he
 He has requested the Personnel Department that a special drive should be launched for the restoration of backlog posts
 unhone kaha ki is tarah itani mushkil se hasil kiye gaye aarakshan kaa koi myne nahin rah jayega
 This is going terribly wrong
 uniwarsity main 200 siten khaliyadav ne bataaya ki jeenyu main itane bade paimaane par shikshakon kii bhartee main obisi ko baahar rakhaa ja rahaa he
 At present, about 200 seats are vacant here, but the university administration is only giving OBC reservation to the post of Assistant Professor, while the law should provide 27 percent reservation in all posts
 obisi chaatro ke liye 83 siten khaliunhone kaha ki yahi haal chaatro ke daakhile main bhi he
 At present, 83 seats of students are vacant in JNU
 is babat prashasan kaa tark he ki obisi catagori se upyukt chaatr nahin mil paae
 Under the OBC reservation, 18 per cent of the seats should have been given to the students of this community while only 14
 2 fisadi siten hi di gayin
 83 students had to bear the brunt of it
 chaatr sangh ne bhi mana, nahin mil rahe aarakshanjeenyu chaatr sangh ke adhyaksh sandip singh ne kaha ki aisa nahin he ki yahaan obisi aarakshan diya hi nahin ja rahaa
 But, the JNU administration's way of giving reservations is arbitrary
 sandip ne kaha ki bharat sarkaar ke disha-nirdesh ke mutabik saamaanya varg ke liye purvanirdhaarit katof ankon main das fisadi tak kii chhot obisi varg ke ummidavaaron ko di jaani chahie
 He said that if 40 marks have been considered as the cutoff marks of the general class in the 100 marks examination, then according to the guidelines of the Government of India, the cutoff of OBC class will be 30 marks
 lekin, jeenyu main iskaa paalan nahin kiya ja rahaa
 The rigging that is taking place in the OBC reservation is even in the recruitment of Assistant Professor, Associate Professor and Professor
 obisi aarakshan die jane main ho rahi dhaandhlee ke masale par pramod yadav kaa maananaa he ki chunki saare padon par sidhi bhartee honi he lihaaja saare padon par obisi aarakshan dena chahie
 Significantly, in its last tenure, the UPA government had made a provision of 27 per cent reservation for obcs in higher-education institutions receiving financial assistance from the central government
 baad main ucchtam nyaayalay ne bhi is par apni muhar lagaayi thi

 Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi has said that changes in the predetermined standards in the changed circumstances, Karbihar should enter the special state
 ‘bihar maange insaaf’ naamak ek seminar ke dauraan apane sambodhan main modi ne kaha ki bharat sarkaar ne kisi pradesh ko vishesh rajya kaa darja dene ko lekar paanch maapdandon kaa ullekh kiya he
 Modi said that in these parameters, the state which has special state status should be a hilly and inaccessible area, the population density should be reduced, the state whose borders are connected to the international border and of strategic importance, in terms of economic and infrastructure Be backward and the state cannot develop its own resources
 unhone kaha ki bharat sarkaar ne 11 rajyon ko vishesh rajya kaa darja diya he or iskaa sabase bada laabh vahaan udyog lagane waalon ko utpaada kar or iskar main se chhot miltaa he
 Modi said that its third biggest benefit is in the centrally sponsored schemes, as an exemption in the amount charged by the states as a state
 unhone kaha ki vartmaan main prativarsh bihar ko centre pryojit yojanaon main kareeb teen se chaar hajaar karod rupee rajyansh ke rup main lagaana padataa he
 Modi said that the criteria set for granting special status to a state is not a cabinet decision nor is it mentioned in the constitution but it is a political decision, so it can be changed
 unhone kaha ki agar kisi rajya main aabaadi kam he to uske kaaran use vishesh rajya kaa darja mil saktaa he par agar kisi rajya main aabaadi kaa ghanatv bahut adhik he to use yah darja kyon nahin diya ja saktaa
 Modi said that 1,120 people live in one square kilometer in Bihar, which would be the highest in the world whereas in India the population density per square kilometer is three and a half hundred
 unhone kaha bihar main pahari kshetron kii kami avashya he par yahaan ke 38 main se 23 jile baadh prabhavit hai jisase har saal inaki puri aadharbhoot sancharana dhwast ho jaati he
 Modi said that in such a situation these areas can be lined up as inaccessible areas
 bihar kaa antarrashtriya seemaa se bhi judaa hua he jis kaaran iskaa mahatv or bad jaataa he
 He said that this state also lacks economic and infrastructure and its internal resources, in such a situation, the reluctance of the central government to give special status to Bihar is meaningless and meaningless
 modi ne kaha ki bihar ko agar vishesh rajya kaa darja miltaa he to badi sankhya main udhyami yahaan udyog lagane aaenge

 In Jagatpuri area of delhi, the miscreants entered the house and took hostage of the elderly woman and her daughter-in-law for two hours of robbery
 lut kaa virodh karne par badmaashon ne bujurg mahila ko chaaku maaraa or donon ke haath-paanv baandhakar munh main kapadaa daal diya
 On receiving the information, the police reached the spot
 is maamle kii jaanch kii ja rahi he
 According to the information, a thief robbed the elderly woman and her daughter-in-law in the Jagatpuri area late Monday inside the house
 ghar ke or aasapaas ke logon ko vaardaat kaa pataa na chale, iske liye ghar main tivi chalaakar aawaaj tej kar diya
 When the elderly woman protested the robbery, she was strangled by attacking him with a knife
 peedita ke anusaar, ghar main kareeb do ghante tak lutpaat karne ke baad badmaash aaraam se vahaan se nikal gaye
 After that, both of them made noise by removing the cloth from the mouth
 padosi vahaan pahunch kar police ko suchit kiye
 The police team that reached the spot has registered a case and started investigation
 shaq jataayaa ja rahaa he ki kichorchat ke raste se aakarvaardatko anjaam die hai
 The time has come to control the use of water like traffic
 2019 main desh ne 51 degree taapmaana kii garmi dekh lee he or bada hissaa sookhe kii chapet main aa chukaa he
 In Bundelkhand, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, people are dying for water
 chennai main pani kii traahi-traahi he or tamilnadu hoicourt rajya sarkaar ko kuch na karne ke liye fatkaar chukaa he
 The monsoon lasts for three to four months and after that a large part of the country relies on ground water or water collected in natural resources
 monsoon se pehle desh ke madhya, dakshini or pashchimi kshetron main pani kii kami hoti he
 The Central Ground Water Board report states that in the pre-monsoon country in 2017, water was generally released at a depth of five to ten meters
 isame dilli, chandigarh or rajasthan ke apwaad bhi shaamil the jahaan 40 meter par pani nikalataa he
 Bikaner has the highest depth in the country at 130 meters
 board ne ye nishkarsh desh main 23 hajaar se zyada monitoring centaron se praapt aankadon ke aadhaar par nikaale hai
 In the report, a two-year pre-monsoon assessment of about 13 and a half wells in the country also shows that the water level decreases in 48% of the wells and rises in such wells
 ghatana badhanaa donon 2 se 4 meter kii range main hota he
 But the cautionary point is that during the ten years from 2007 to 2017, the water level of 71% of the wells in the country declined and 43% of these water went down to two meters
 ye giravat kamobesh sabhi rajyon main darj hui he
 Obviously, this decline is the cause of concern
 sansad kii standing cameti on water risource (2017-2018) kii 23 veen report niti ayog ke hawaale se kahati he ki desh ke 60 karod log peyajal sankat kaa saamana karte hai or aane vaale 10 saalon yani 2030 tak desh main pani kii maang aaj ke mukaable doguni ho jaaegi
 Severe water scarcity is expected to reduce GDP by 6 percent
 desh main uplabdh pani kaa 85 fisadi kheti main lagata he or isamen se bhi 65 fisadi bhumigat jal kheti main istemaal hota he or pine or gharelu istemaal main mahaj 6 fisadi pani istemaal kiya jaataa he
 India has the highest water use in the world for farming and this is due to traditional methods of production
 packaged water industry 3 fisadi pani kaa istemaal kar rahi he
 There is no shortage of water in the country, it is lack of management
 prabandhan ke liye kanoon hone chahie
 Like land, water is a state subject
 kareeb ek darjan rajyon main hi bhoojal sangrakshan kanoon lagu hai
 The problem is actually in thinking
 angrejon ke jamaane vaale kanoonon ke mutabik jameen kaa maalik hi jameen ke neeche ke pani kaa maalik bhi he
 But the Supreme Court has made it clear in many decisions that the exploitation of ground water will not happen without the approval of the government
 bhoojal kii maalik sarkaar he
 The Uttar Pradesh Ground Water (management and Control) Bill 2017 is ready in Uttar Pradesh but do not know why Yogi Adityanath's BJP government has not approved to bring it to the Assembly yet
 agar ye vidheyak lagu ho gaya to upi main bhoojal nikaalane kii anumati sarkaar se leni padegi, udyogon ko to ye bhi bataanaa hoga ki kitna pani roj nikaala jayega
 The government will also charge a fee for this
 block level se lekar rajya str tak taqatvar bhoojal prabandhan cametiyaan banengi
 Apart from the permission to draw water, these committees will have to give information about drying of wells
 sarkaar pani kii kami vaale ilaakon ko adhishuchet karegi
 There is a provision of punishment from the jail to the fine for violating the provisions of the bill
 sawaal ye he ki ye lagu kab hoga
 Apart from the drop in ground water level, there are different concerns about it being polluted and unhealthy
 desh ke 224 jilon main fluoride kaa str maanak se upar chal rahaa he or isamen rajasthan ke sabase zyada 30 jile hai
 Similarly, the level of arsenic is higher than the standard in 80 districts in 10 states and it has the maximum number of 20 districts in UP, 18 in Assam, 15 in Bihar and 13 in Haryana
 isaki ek vajah factriyon se niklaa rasinic pani jameen main janaa bhi he
 There are no visible arrangements to stop it
 darasal, desh main sarkaron or raajnneetik ichhashakti kaa alam bhi mausam kii tarah he
 If there is a severe summer, everyone shouts and talk about water conservation and availability, but after the month, as soon as it rains, forgetting the lack of water, they start talking about floods and waterlogging
 is dharna se baahar aane ke liye jo raajnneetik ichhashakti dikhni chahie wo abhi tak najar nahin aa rahi he
 Modern farming techniques can be used in water management, ground water recharge campaigns and by increasing the depth and depth of the ponds and rivers
 iske liye sarkaron ko sakht to hona hi padegaa

 Meanwhile, political uproar has begun with thousands of voter ID cards caught in the capital Bangalore

 Late Tuesday evening, Congress leader Randeep Surjewala held a press conference on the issue and said that the BJP wants to draw attention to it by blaming the Congress
 surajevaala ne kaha ki yah voter idi card naa to police ne baraamad kiye hai naa hi chunaav ayog ne balki inhen bijepi kaaryakarta ne baraamad kiya he
 Surjewala alleged that the flat from which the voter ID cards were recovered belonged to Manjula Nanjamuri, who is the leader of the BJP
 jabaki ghar main rahane vaala kiraayedaar unheen kaa betaa rakesh he
 Surjewala hit back at the BJP, saying that in 2015, Rakesh contested the corporation election on a BJP ticket but he lost

 anil kumble pichley saal team india ke head coach chune gaye
 He performed brilliantly throughout the year
 iske baad bhi ve apni kursi nahin bachaa sake
 There are many reasons behind this, but the biggest reason is being considered as captain Virat Kohli himself
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki pichley kuch din se viraat coach kumble ke virodh main khulkar aa gaye the
 These 5 reasons forced Kumble to resign? 1
 kumble ke naam par khulkar saamne aa gaye the viratchampions trophy main pakistan ke haathon haar ke baad coach kumble or captain viraat ke bich sulajhata hua maamla phir ulajh gaya tha
 Virat openly objected to Kumble before the Cricket Advisory Committee (CAC) a day before the final
 jisase salaahkaar samiti pasopesh main thi
 2
 coach ke taur par shastri ko chaahate hai viratmedia reports kii maane, to coach ke taur par viraat kohli kii pehali pasand ravi shastri hai
 He was associated with Team India before Kumble as a director and coach
 3
 Kumble's contract ended on Sunday, after Champion's Trophy, Anil Kumble's tenure as a coach was ending, which was extended by the BCCI to the Indies tour
 25 may ko is pad ke liye aavedan maange gaye the
 Kumble received direct entry in bcci's applications for the coach
 vahiin, purv ballebaaj virendra sahvaag bhi is daud main shaamil hai
 4
 board main koi tarafdaari vaala na honakumble kaa sillection team india ke dhakad cricketrs rahe sachin tendulkar, saurav ganguli or vivies lakshmana ne kiya tha
 But after that there was no one to support Kumble on the board
 aise bade maukey kam hi aae the jab board main koi kumble ke saport main khulkar saamne aayaa
 5
 anushaasan kaa sakhti se paalankaha jaataa he ki coach kumble team india main anushaasan ko lekar kaaphi sakht the
 On several occasions, he had also been beaten up by the players during practice
 saath hi kai dauron par ve team ke khilaadiyon kii garlfriend, patniyon ke jane ke bhi khilaaf the
 However, he never made an open statement about this
 pariksha se pehle khud par shaq karnaa aapako tanaav de saktaa he or aap kai chizon ko bhul sakate hai
 So instead of doubting yourself, learn to trust yourself
 mahilaon ke ek group ne shanivaar kii raat aam aadmi party (AAP) ke vidhayak manoj kumaar ke khilaaf utpeedan or marpet kii shikaayat darj karai he
 Police said that about 20 women have alleged that when they reached Manoj Kumar's office to register their protest over road, sewage and water problems, she and her supporters abused and harassed the women as well
 mahilaon ne aarope lagaaya ki unhone manoj kumaar ke daftar main ghusane kii koshish kii lekin unke samarthakon ne unhen jabaran roak diya
 While protesting, the women started shouting slogans against the MLA, after which they were pushed

 Brij Bhushan said that the notice of the Sports Tribunal was received at such a short time that neither Tonersingh could present his arguments nor could he call his lawyer in Rio nor did the Wrestling Federation of India have the proper time for replacement of Narasimha
 chunki narsingh apana medical or vajan de chukaa tha, jiske baad yadi koi vaikalpik pahalwaan maujuud bhi hota to pratiyogita main bhaag nahin le saktaa tha
 If the International anti-doping Agency (WADA) had appealed some time ago, then the wrestling association would have had time to replace Narasimha
 unhone kaha ki narsingh ne haryana police main us shaks ke khilaaf jisane sonipat training centre main uske amino drink main doping kii dawa milaai thi, likhit shikaayat darj karai he, lekin police kii krime investigation agency (siie) ne aaj tak koi karrwai nahin kii he
 Brij Bhushan, who had caused damage to the country by the conspiracy, said, 'if the crime investigation agency of the police used to interrogate this person in custody, today the country would not have lost a medal and a big wrestler of the country would not have to bear a four-year ban
 main chahta hum ki bharat sarkaar is shadyantra ke khilaaf sibiai jaanch kare, jisase aane vaale samay main kisi bhi khilaadi ke saath aisa ghinauna kaary naa ho or isse desh ko padakon kaa nuksaan naa ho

 The Parliament's Standing Committee on Finance, headed by senior BJP leader Yashwant Sinha, has returned nine bills to Parliament
 ye bill alag-alag samay se sarkaar ke paas lambit pade hue hai
 These include the Direct Taxes Code (DTC) bill, Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) bill and Insurance bill
 inke jariye tex vyavastha, pension prabandhan or beemaa kshetra main sudhaaron kii raah par kaaphi aage tak badha ja saktaa he
 The pension and insurance sectors are gasping badly due to lack of funds
 inke alaava jameen adhigrahan or punarvaas bill, 2012 bhi gramin vikaas par sthaayee samiti dwaara lautaae jane ke baad sarkaar ke paas lambit padaa he
 The bill deals with the right to provide fair compensation to farmers whose land is owned by the government for their wholly owned or PPP projects, or by the private sector
 inamen se adhiktar bill par sarkaar ko gathbandhan ke bheetar or vipakshi dalon ke saath sahmati banani hogi
 But given the atmosphere of confrontation, this seems unlikely

 Leaders of both the opposition parties and Congress alliance partners believe that the problem is going to get aggravated by Manmohan Singh's inability to communicate with friends and persuade opponents
 yashavanth sinha kehete hai, ''badakismati se pranab mukherjee ke hatane ke baad ab sarkaar main sahmati banane vaala koi netaa nahin bachaa he
 "now the question arises that how will Manmohan Singh be able to stand firm on the important matter of governance?" Dull ministers have to be removed for this
 sarkaar ke kai diggaj neend main hai
 First of all they need to be awakened

 The credibility of the government has reached its lowest level, due to which now there is no option left before the Prime Minister to live up to his last efforts to save his image and legacy from drowning
 arthshaastri bibek debaroy kehete hai, ''manmohan singh ko sudhaar prakriya main nayaa josh bharne kii jarurat he or hamen yah bhuulane par majaboor karnaa hoga ki 'sudhaar' ab bhi 'ateet' kii baat nahin hui he

 The ministries have been divided on the basis of regional sentiments, caste and personal loyalty
 congress ke zyaadaatar mantri manmohan singh yaa congress adhyaksh ke ehsaanmand hai
 As far as coalition partners are concerned, the leader of the allies decides who will represent their party in the Council of Ministers
 congress ke ek mantri kehete hai, ''is samay to bade paimaane par kisi tarah kaa pherbadal nahin ho saktaa
 The Prime Minister can only make minor changes in the portfolios of ministers
 ''ab jab pranab mukherjee vitt mantralay se baahar ja chuke hai, pradhanmantri ko rigerv bank ke governor di
 Taking advantage of his correct equation from Subbarao, interest rates should be reduced, which will encourage investment and reverse the period of decline in the country's development
 purv vitt mantri ke rigerv bank ke governor ke saath rishte asahaj the or pichley ek saal main unke baar-baar ishaaron ke baad bhi rigerv bank ne byaaj daron main kami laane se lagaataar inkaar kiya he
 Just 10 days before he stepped down (june 26, 2012), Mukherjee had given enough hints that interest rates should be cut now, but in the quarterly review of monetary policy released on June 18, the Reserve Bank did nothing like this did
 arthvyavastha ke graph ko upar kii ore le jane ke liye rigerv bank ko byaaj daron main katautee kerani hi hogi
 But this decision will not be easy for him because if it is done now then he can be accused that he was deliberately obstructing Mukherjee's plan to revive the economy
 yashavanth sinha kehete hai, ''yah maananaa ki mukherjee vitt mantralay ko ek vyaktigat jaagir kii tarah chalaa rahe the or unke nirnyon se pradhanmantri kaa koi sarokaar nahin tha, vastav main ek gambhir bhul hogi
 Today, the Prime Minister was aware of all the decisions which are being criticized very much today
 ''jetali bhi sinha se sahmati jataate hue kehete hai, ''rajnatik arthvyavastha ke prabandhan ke liye nirnay lene kii kshamta hona behad jaruri he
 You first try to build consensus within your party, then think about the opposition

 If the Prime Minister is able to do this, then it will be very good for him and the country as well

 ) Former Gujarat Governor Kamala Beniwal misused the government aircraft while in office
 gujarat raaj bhawan ke records se pataa chalata he ki beniwal sarkari vimaan se teen varshon main 63 baar rajya se baahar gayi
 Most of these visits were from her home state of Rajasthan and she always traveled to Jaipur by government plane
 beniwal ne sarkari vimaan kaa kitna durupyog kiya, iskaa udhaaharan is baat se miltaa he ki 2011-12 main unhone 83 ghante hawa main bitaye, 2012-13 main unhone 91 ghante or 2013-14 main 102 ghante
 Beniwal, 87, is currently the Governor of Mizoram
 vah gujarat main tainaati ke dauraan ahmedabad se jaipur teen varshon main 53 baar gayi or 10 baar dilli ain
 Interestingly, his visits were described as official so that the aircraft could be used for free and they would continue to get all the facilities and perks
 vah 2010 se pad se hatane tak 497 din rajya se baahar raheen
 Although it is difficult to say what is the cost of such visits, but reliable sources said that every visit to Beniwal was worth Rs 1
5 crore, that is, it costs almost that much
 beniwal kaa jaipur kaa har daura oficial bataaya jaataa tha jabaki sirf dilli kaa hi unka daura oficial hota tha
 Of all the air trips to Beniwal, only 12 were declared private
 vah har saal ausatan 100 din rajya se baahar rahati thim
 These figures are taken from Gujarat Raj Bhavan and are being scrutinized
 beniwal kaa tatkaaleen mukhya mantri narendra modi se katu rishta rahaa
 There were many differences between the Lokayukta and some laws
 modi kii sarkaar aate hi beniwal ko mizoram kaa governor banaakar bhej diya gaya
 He left Ahmedabad on 9 July
 haalanki unka kaarykaal november main hi khatm ho gaya
 She kept many important bills on hold and some bills she kept for three years
 har vidheyak ko lekar baith janaa unka swabhaav ban gaya tha
 When Beniwal was transferred to Mizoram, he tried his best to stop it
 lekin unhen janaa hi padaa
 During the confrontation with Modi, Beniwal issued a notification to make retired Justice RA Mehta a Lokayukta of Gujarat without consulting him
 iske khilaaf rajya sarkaar ne adaalat kii sharan lee lekin baat ne banane par supreme court gai jisane governor ke faisle ko barkaraar rakhaa
 But Justice Mehta himself got out of it
 iske baad modi ne duusare sajjan kaa naam aage badhaayaa

 Sreesanth comments on Hardik Pandya KL Rahul controversy As a guest in Koffee with Karan, cricketers Hardik Pandya and KL Rahul have invited the controversy
 mahilaon par die hardik pandya ke ashleel bayanon ne soshal media par tufaan machaa diya he
 The cricketer is being criticized everywhere
 vivaad badhata dekh is episod ko hotstarane hataa diya he
 The reaction of Bigg Boss 12 fame Sreesanth has come to light on Hardik's contradictory statements
 colors ke event main pahunche srisanth ne kaha- ''main aajkal tivi or akhbaar bahut kam padhata hum
 i am only watching Bigg Boss episodes these days
 agar aisa kuch hua he to mere khyaal se ection bhi liya ja chukaa he
 The BCCI takes a decision very quickly
 '' unhone kaha- ''un dononko khataron ke khilaadi yaa big bos main bhejo
 Next year he must be sent to Big Boss, i am saying it will be very good
 ''duusare ek intervyuu main srisanth ne hardik pandya or keel rahul par bolte hue kaha-'' jo bhi hua bahut bura hua
 But the World Cup is near
 hardik or rahul achche khilaadi hai
 All i would say is that they are both match winners

 What: the boys made some 'sexist comments'
 
 Result by the BCCI: suspension for the ongoing series against Aussies and the next one against the Kiwis
 But i want to ask all of you, is that a right decision to do
 They damn sure made some unacceptable comments on the show, but we all know what the nature of the show is
 They must have said some things which are not acceptable by many but that’s their personal life
 There is no point of connecting their personal life with their professional life
 Parties, friends, girls are part of their personal life and cricket is their professional one
 And it would be better if everyone does not mix it both
 i just wanna say that banning them from playing for their country just because of some talk show is not right
 If they want to learn from their mistakes they will do so without being banned and if not then no punishment can make them better
 Both the players are crucial for the Indian team and banning them will harm Indian cricket only like it did to Aussies after they banned Warner and Smith
 Hardik's and kl's behavior should be criticized and they should be punished in some other way, i just wanna say that banning them is not the solution
 Write to us in our comment section what you think about this whole episode

 com / ejm1lzubdr The Supreme Court has dismissed the petition of NGO Arrive Safe India in the case of denotifying the highway passing through Chandigarh city
 supreme court ke is aadesh se duusare rajyon main bhi asar padegaa jahaan haive shahar se hokar city road kii tarah guzarate hai
 During the hearing of the case, the Supreme Court said that if the State Highway City has been denotified then there is nothing wrong in it
 kyonki shahar main tej raftaar se gaadiyaan nahin chalatin
 The Supreme Court said that our order is very clear that there will be no liquor shops within 500 meters of the National and State Highways
 pichhali sunwaayee main supreme court ne tippanee kii thi ki agar koi state haive city ke bich se hokar gujarata he or agar use dinotiphoi kiya jaataa he to pehali najar main galat nahin hoga
 Because trains from the middle of the city usually run at a slow speed
 city ke andar ke haive or city ke baahar ke haive main bahut antar he
 Highway means where high speed vehicles move
 supreme court ne kaha hamaare aadesh kaa uddeshy sirf yah tha ki haive ke paas sharaab uplabdh na ho kyonki log sharaab pikar teji se gaadi chalaate hai or durghatana ho jaati he
 In fact, the name of the highway has been changed to 'major District Road' in many places in Chandigarh
 isi ko lekar arive sef india naamak enjio ne supreme court main yachika daakhil kii he
 The petition said that the Supreme Court had taken a decision in public interest to close liquor shops on the highway as it leads to road accidents
 aise main chandigarh prashasan kaa supreme court ke aadesh ko nishprabhavi karne ke liye 16 march 2017 kaa notification avaidh he or radd kiya janaa chahie
 However, the Punjab and Haryana High Court has dismissed this petition
 maamle kii sunwaayee ke dauraan supreme court ne kaha agar state haive city ko dinotiphoi kiya gaya he to isamen kuch galat nahin he
 Because trains do not run at high speed in the city
 supreme court ne kaha hamaara aadesh bilkul saaf he ki neshnal or state hai ve ke 500 meter ke daayre main sharaab kii dukaane nahin hongi
 In the previous hearing, the Supreme Court had remarked that if a state passes through the middle of the city and if it is denotified it will not be wrong at first sight
 kyonki shahar ke bich se gaadiya aam taur par dhimi raftaar se chalati hai
 There are many differences between highways within the city and highways outside the city
 haive kaa matlab he jahaan tej raftaar main gaadiyaan chalati hon
 The Supreme Court said that the purpose of our order was that liquor should not be available near the highway because people drink alcohol and drive fast and accidents happen
 darasal chandigarh main kai jagah haive kaa naam badalakar 'major distric road' kaa naam kar diya gaya he
 For this, an NGO called Arrival Safe India has filed a petition in the Supreme Court
 yachika main kaha gaya he ki supreme court ne haive par sharaab kii dukaanon ko band karne kaa faisla janhit main liya tha kyonki isse sadak durghatnaayen hoti hai
 In such a situation, the notification of March 16, 2017 by the Chandigarh administration to nullify the order of the Supreme Court is illegal and should be canceled
 haalanki punjab evam haryana hoicourt is yachika ko khaarij kar chukaa he
 In Britain, a two-year-old child had to be hospitalized by a waiter's accidentally drinking whiskey during his birthday party

 The child was then rushed to the hospital where he was kept under the supervision of doctors

 The matter is being investigated in the restaurant
 bachche kii 34 varshiya maa nina rij ne kaha ki unhone bete ke liye neembu-pani kaa order diya tha, jo use bada pasand tha
 He said, 'we saw that he used to make strange mouths whenever he drank it
 maine usase gilaas lekar piyaa to mere seene evam gale main jalan hone lagi
 Sony had drank at least ten sips
 usapar nasha puri tarah chadh gaya tha

 unhen is baat kaa bhi andaja he ki is vajah se aam shahari jo ki apni naukari yaa kaamkaaj par ja rahaa he use dikkat hui hogi
 The traffic police may have closed some routes and the traffic speed may have been reduced on some routes
 or is vajah se kisaanon ne dilli waalon ke naam ek khulaa patr jari kiya he jo parche kii shakl main hai or pichhali raat se hi soshal media par viral ho rahaa he
 Before we tell you what is written in this leaflet
 kuch yaad karwaanaa zaruri he
 Thousands of farmers marched from Pune to Mumbai in March this year
 mumbai main unhen vidhansabha bhawan ke paas pahunchnaa tha
 But when the farmers came to know that the children had examinations the next day, they decided to walk at night
 lagbhag do sau kilometre kii paidal yatra kar chuke hazaron kisaan puri raat chale or mumbai main apane liye tay sthaan par pahunche taaki agali subah jin bacchon ko pariksha main shaamil hona he unhen koi dikkat naa ho
 Yes, now the matter of the leaflet that the farmers who have come to Delhi has been issued to the Delhiites
 parche main sabase pehle to shahari logon se maafi maangi gai he
 It is written, 'sorry! You must have had trouble with this march of ours
 ’parche main aage yah samajhane kii koshish kii gai he ki kisaan kisi ko pareshaan karne kii niyat se dilli main daakhil nahin hue hai
 Since he himself is troubled, he has come here to tell his problems to the government
 aap ye puraa parchaa yahan pard sakate hai
 According to information received from Google, in November last year, farmers from some areas of the country had gathered on Parliament Street in Delhi
 tab kisaan sansad yojit kiya gaya tha
 Some proposals were passed
 din bhar kaa aayojan tha
 By evening the Parliament road was empty
 pichley kuch dinon main rajasthan ke sikar, madhya pradesh ke mandsaur, tamilnadu or upi main kisaanon kaa pradarshan hota rahaa he
 Somewhere milk was poured on the streets and elsewhere farmers put potatoes in front of the assembly
 aise main sawaal uthta he ki kisaanon kii samasya kitni badi he jiske bare main sarkaar kaa daawa he ki pichhali sarkaar main kisaanon ko jitna mil rahaa tha, usase zyaada mil rahaa he
 For years, senior journalist who did farming and village journalism
 sainath ke mutabiq ab ye samasya keval kisaanon kii nahin rahi
 Has become social
 ek media channel se baat karte hue wo kehete hai, ‘sarkaar dwaara jari aakadon ke mutabiq pichley bees saal main teen lakh se zyaada kisaan aatmahatya kar chuke hai
 Now, tell us how big it is that three lakh farmers have committed suicide in our country and all is going well in the society
 kisi ko kuch farq nahin pad rahaa he
