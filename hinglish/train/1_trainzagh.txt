 The Kanhar irrigation project, which has been pending for 39 years in up's Sonbhadra district, has now suddenly brought death decree for thousands of tribals like Baldhari, against whom agitation has also started
 14 april ko adivaasiyon or police ke bich hinsak jhadap bhi hui, jisamen ek darjan se zyada log ghayal ho gaye

 up's largest interstate "kanhar Irrigation Project" involving three states at the confluence of Kanhar and its tributary Pangan is taking shape at Amwar village, 11 km east of Dudhigh

 People belonging to Gond, Kharwar, Bhuiyan, Cheru, Panika tribal castes living here will bear the brunt of displacement
 iske alaava chhattisgarh or jharkhand ke 4-4 gaanvon kaa astitv bhi mit jayega

 1977 main sarkaar ne pariyojna nirmaan ke liye dhanrashi sweekrut kar prabhavit adivaasiyon ke pariwaron kaa survey shuru kiya

 Pakistan's Foreign Secretary Salman Bashir will not have to declare any list of wanted terrorists sent by the far more proud home minister of India as a 'mere slip'
 parchaa kaa sarokaar aalaa darje kii kala se hota he
 They can ask it to ask the next question in the press conference, terming it merely a shagufa
 bharat kii sabase gambhir samasya ko majaak main tabdeel karne ke liye kuch kshamta to chahie hi, lekin chidambaram ke adheen grih mantralay ne vah kuwwat hasil kar lee he
 If you include a person in Chidambaram's 'most Wanted' list - Rekul Qamar Khan is actually one
 jari vyapaaree he, jo varshon se mumbai ke paas thane ke vaagale estate main rah rahaa he- kii hakeekat khulne par soch rahe honge ki roen yaa hansen, to kuch atirikt jaankaree se aapako apana iraadaa banane main madad mil sakati he
 The Mumbai Police repeatedly asked Delhi to remove the name of Rekul Khan from the list and replace him with the names of two brothers - Riyaz and Iqbal Bhatkal
 ye donon bhai varanasi, ahmedabad, pune visphoton ke silsile main vaanchit hai
 But the Bhatkal brothers were not included
 shaayad grih mantralay ko laga ki suchi main 50 vyaktiyon ke naam daal kar ek hataane se sankhya avibhajya 51 ho jaati, isse zyada acha he
 Chidambaram ignored this big mistake in his familiar style
 unhone kaha, ''mujhe nahin lagata ki hamen ise bada mudda bananaa chahie
 It is possible that there was a mistake or there may be two people of the same name
 '' is bayaan se asli mudde ko darkinar kar diya gaya
 Not India but Pakistan can make it a big issue
 islamabad bharat se kah saktaa he ki suchi ko apane pulisavaalon ke bich baanto, or aisa kehete hue vah chaahe to kutilata se muskaraa saktaa he
 Apart from a tear or a smile, there is a third option
 'most wanted' kii suchi main sabase upar naam he daaud ibrahim kaa, jo 1993 ke mumbai bamkand kaa mukhya abhiyukt he
 After the assassination of Osama bin Laden, some of the sheikh-chillies in Delhi also portrayed the danger of capturing Dawood in the american-abbottabad style
 lekin mumbai ke nagpada ilaake se daaud ke bhai ikbaal kaskar ko pakadaney ke liye aapako america cills yaa marine kii jarurat nahin he
 Nor is it a case that Dawood, on the one hand, may be an international villain, younger brother Iqbal living in a Gandhi ashram serving the village and religion
 kaskar bhi ek badmaash hi he
 9 on Tuesday 17 May
 15 par khaanaa khaakar apane driver-angrakshak aarif bael (jo aarif jewelri or abu bakr ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa tha) ke saath nagpada main tahal rahaa tha tabhi motorcycle par savaar do logon ne us par hamalaa kar diya
 In that attack, Mr
 Jewellry became disoriented
 sawaalh mumbai anderworld kaa sadsy daaud kaa bhai, jo daaud giroh ke aapraadhik sampark main he, salaakhon ke peeche kyon nahin he? yah samaj se pare he ki mumbai police ko kaskar kii maujuudagi ke bare main usee tarah jaankaree nahin thi jaise iesai laden kii maujuudagi se bekhbar thi
 The ISI protected Laden under a double move
 mumbai police ne daaud ke bhai or uske dhandhon ko mahaj laalach ke alaava kisi or cheez ke liye nahin bachaaya
 Law and order may be a state subject, but whose rule is in Mumbai? Of Congress and NCP
 mumbai susangathit jangal ban gai he, jisamen sabake ilaake tay hai
 Nagpada gives an idea of the modern city: the huge building of the Mumbai Municipal Corporation, then the huge building that houses the headquarters of the largest media company in the country, there is a traffic jam between the old railway station, the beautiful club and green area just a short distance away
 is
 sarkaar bheed bhare shahari ilaake or ek aise anderworld ke sashastitv kii ore se munh mode leti he, jo ek raashtra ke pramukh angon ko khatm karne kii sajeesh rachataa he
 When panic is created in such a labyrinth, why should he be surprised? The blame for fishery justice cannot be passed on to Chidambaram
 lekin mumbai par iesai kii sajeesh se hue hamale ke baad shivaraj patil kii jagah unhen grih mantri banaaya gaya tha
 He had special ignorance about terrorism and his connection to Pakistan through the wire of the Mumbai underworld
 chidambaram kii khaasiyat unki kshamta maani jaati thi
 But after two and a half years, a lot of mistakes have accumulated on his feet like dirt
 telugana maamle ke, jo nishchit rup se unka sabase kharaab raajnneetik faisla tha, galat akalan ke saath hi kai aise galat anumaan lagaae gaye jinaki parinti jagan reddy kii shandaar jeet ke rup main nikali, or isse us garh main congress mantrimandal khatm ho saktaa he, jahaan se party ne dilli par kabja kiya
 a new idea in the capital, which may be a little revolutionary or destructive, is doing home: When the cowboy Chidambaram takes out his gun, his feet tremble
 maamla sirf chidambaram ke hansi kaa paatr banane kaa ho to yah nijee traasadee hogi
 But when India becomes a laughing stock in Pakistan, it becomes a national wound

 According to the evidence, those who got less than the prescribed standards were also recruited
 kai maamalon main to 90 main se 3 number paane waalon ko bhi naukari de di gai
 At the same time, the recipients of 64 out of 90 were also declared

 In these recruitments done by the Women's Welfare and Health Department, the candidates have accused the government of the irregularities
 agar sarkari website par dekha jaae to kai logon ke riglts aise hai, jisase unhen passing marks bhi nahin mili hai
 Despite this, they were considered to be good for recruitment, while in many districts, the people who got higher numbers were also left behind
 mantri ne di thi ye safayeeis maamle ke ujagar hone ke baad mantri reeta bahuguna joshi ne kaha, 'sarkaar ne paardarshee tareeke se bhartee karaane ke liye har jile me alag merit list banavaai he, isliye aisa hua he
 For example, in a district 100 people appeared in the examination and if someone got maximum 10 marks, then he got admitted
 lekin agar kisi duusare shahar me parikshaarthi ne pachaas number paae, lekin usase bhi zyada ank paane vaale log hai to uski bhartee nahin hui

 The Deputy Governor of Delhi has sought permission from the President to invite the BJP to form the government
 aaj jab supreme court main centre sarkaar ne yah chitthee dikhaai to sarkaar banane ko lekar chal rahi tamaam bahes phir se ek duusari disha main gum gai
 In this letter dated September 4, the Deputy Governor says that President's rule is in force in Delhi from February 17, 2014
 sanvaidhanik paramparaon ke mutabik or supreme court dwaara niyat is qaayade ke mutabik ki vidhansabha bhang karne kii sifaarish se pehle ek lokapriy sarkaar banane kii sari koshish kar leni chahie main abhaari hounga agar bharat ke mananeey raashtrapati bhartiya janata party ko jo ab bhi vidhansabha main sabase badi party he− nyotaa dekar ye jaanane kii ijazat den ki sarkaar gathan main unki dilchaspee he yaa nahin
 If the BJP agrees, i will ask them to demonstrate the necessary power to form a permanent government in front of the House within a stipulated time, possibly within a week
 bijepi kii pratikriya dekhakar bhavishya kii karrwai tay kii ja sakati he
 You know that Arvind Kejriwal, the leader of the Aam Aadmi Party, has filed a petition in the Supreme Court demanding that the Assembly be dissolved and the elections held
 usee ke silsile main aaj sunwaayee thi jo ab das aktubar ko hogi
 The Supreme Court also refused to accept the sting of the Aam Aadmi Party
 pichley chah maheene main aam aadmi party or bhartiya janata party donon par vidhayakon ke kharid yaa laalach dene ke aarope lag chuke hai
 On Monday, the Aam Aadmi Party also allegedly provided evidence by stinging that the bjp's vice president was trying to buy his MLA
 bijepi ne kaha ki upaadhyaksh iske liye adhikrut nahin hai or unhen kaaran bataao notice pakadaa diya
 Today Arvind Kejriwal has said that an attempt has been made to contact at least fifteen mlas
 aisa hi aarope aam aadmi party ke netaaon par congress ke vidhayak laga chuke hai
 Such allegations have not been substantiated
 magar aam aadmi party kaa koi vidhayak nahin tutaa he or na bijepi kaa
 In between, there are reports of Congress mlas turning off their mobile phones
 bhartiya raajnneeti main jod tod se sarkaar banane kii aisi misaalen hai ki unki duhai dekar kuch bhi karnaa ateet kii un karatuuton ko back date main manyata dene jaisaa hoga
 The Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party have clearly stated that they are in favor of elections
 phir bijepi se sarkaar poochne kaa matlab kya tod-phod kii kisi tarkeeb ko rasta nahin dena he? bijepi ne bhi ye nahin kaha he ki vah sarkaar bananaa chaahati he
 Then what is the basis for the Deputy Governor to call BJP? is vakt bijepi-akali gathbandhan ke paas 29 or aap ke paas 27 vidhayak hai
 For the majority, 34 mlas are required i

 BJP needs 5 more
 bijepi 12 disambar 2013 ko likhit rup main kah chuki he ki vah sarkaar nahin banaaegi
 Then there were 32 mlas and only four mlas were needed
 to kya bijepi ne ab koi tazaa likhit yaa maukhik sahmati di he
 Then on what basis are the Lt Governor inviting the BJP to form the government
 dilli main sarkaar bananaa zaruri he to loksabhaa chunaavon ke baad khaali hui teen siton ke liye up chunaav kyon nahin karaae gaye
 Is it because the House will have a capacity of 67, requiring fewer legislators for the majority
 farvari 2005 main bihar main vidhansabha kaa chunaav hua to kisi ko bahumat nahin mila
 Then the Governor of Bihar reported to the President on 6 March 2005 that the new assembly be adjourned
 21 may 2005 ko rajyapal ne phir report bheji ki kisi bhi formule se sarkaar banati nahin dikh rahi he or vidhayakon ke kharid farokht kii ashanka he lihaaza vidhansabha bhang ho or logon ko sarkaar chunane kaa ek or mauka mili
 The President dissolved the assembly
 is maamle ko supreme court main chunauti di gai
 The Supreme Court said that the decision to dissolve the assembly is unconstitutional, but did not reinstate the assembly
 adaalat kaa jab faisla aayaa tab bihar main dobaaraa chunaav shuru ho chukaa tha
 In the book of Kaul and Shakdhar, it is written that the court can also consider the ground reality and other important factors and change the relief according to the circumstances, declaring the dissolution of the assembly as unconstitutional
 kya dilli ke up rajyapal ko vidhayakon ke kareed farokht kii bilkul ashanka nahin he
 Should the Lieutenant Governor not have taken cognizance of this and informed the President
 raashtrapati ko jo chitthee likhi gai he vah donon chor se khuli hui he
 Will ask BJP and give a week's time for majority
 yah bahumat kahaan se aayega or iskaa tarika jaij ho kya rajyapal yaa up rajyapal ko kisi dal ko nyotaa dene se pehle isse santusht nahin hona chahie
 The constitution itself says that the governor or the lieutenant governor has to be satisfied whether the person who is calling to form the government has majority or not
 ab sawaal aata he sikret ballat kaa
 The term is not in any provision of the Constitution
 jis ensiti act ke section 92 kii vyakhya ho rahi he usamen sikret ballat nahin likhaa he
 The Lieutenant Governor can send a message to the Legislative Assembly, but this provision does not say that it can send a message in the context of forming a government
 sikret ballat agar kahin hai to kya vah dalbadal kanoon ke khilaaf nahin he? BJP has not yet said that it has the necessary numbers to form the government
 yah bhi nahin kaha he ki vah sarkaar nahin banaaegi or chunaav hone chahie
 So, shouldn't the Lieutenant Governor ask the BJP? Is Delhi really in a position to form a government? If so what is this sabotage apart from buying and selling? Can the Deputy Governor be unaware of this fear and call someone to form the government? dilli main nagar nigam (emsidi) chunaavon main baagiyon se jujh rahi bhaajapa ne ‘party ke anushaasan ko todane ke liye’ apane saat vartmaan parshadon ko party se barkhaast kar diya or party ke aadhikarik ummidavaaron ke khilaaf apane sambandhiyon ko khadaa karne vaale netaaon ko karrwai kii chetavanee di
 The councilors who have been removed include Praveen Rajput, Rajesh Yadav, Prabhat Singh, Harish Awasthi, Sudesh Bhasin, Jagdish Mamagen and Veena Abrol
 mamgen ne pehle hi party se istipha de diya he jabaki anya 15 april ko hone vaale dilli nagar nigam chunaavon main party ke aadhikarik ummidavaaron ke khilaaf maidan main hai
 Delhi BJP President Vijender Gupta said, "if anyone breaks the discipline of the party, it will be considered as indiscipline and action will be taken against him
" ’ Union minister of state for home Hansraj Ahir has said similar operations will continue against terrorists after the killing of jaish-e-mohammed militant and Jaish founder and militant terrorist Masood Azhar's nephew Talha Rashid in Pulwama, Kashmir
 ahir ne yah bhi kaha ki ek din ham pakistan ke kabje vaale kashmir ko bharat main shaamil kar lenge
 Ahir said, "our soldiers have shown that we will not tolerate terrorism
 PAK army aatankwaadiyon ke paas hathiyaar pahunchaa rahi he
 We kept saying again and again that Pakistan delivers weapons to terrorists
 PAK army aatankwaadiyon ko paalati he or aatankwaad ko badhaava detii he
 But our forces are vigilant and the biggest operations will continue against them
 "'hat chukaa he pakistan kaa nakaab'ahir ne kaha, "pakistan kaa nakaab ab hat chukaa he ki kis tareeke se hathiyaaron kii supplai kar pakistan aatankwaad ko badha rahaa he
 Whatever threats Masood Azhar threatens, his intentions will not succeed and whichever terrorist will take action against India, he will be piled up there
 sena ko puri chhot he or jab bhi jarurat padegi, sena kaarywahi karne ke liye taiyaar he
 "it is noteworthy that three terrorists were killed during an encounter in Pulwama, Jammu and Kashmir
 maare gaye aatankiyon menmasood ajahar kaa bhaanja talha rashidbhi shaamil tha, jisaki khud jaish e mohammad ke pravaktaa ne pushti kii he
 Jaish has also threatened India that a day will come when the Indian Army will have to leave the valley
 'sena ek or sargical strike karne main sakasham'grih rajyamantri hansraj ahir ne jaish kii dhamkee par kaha, "hamaari sena aatankwaadiyon ko ghus-ghus kar maar rahi he
 The army has so much strength and so much leeway that it can carry out another surgical strike
 centre sarkaar ke special ripregentative kashmir main hai
 They are talking to all sides there, but our bullets will not stop
 baatcheet chalati rahegi, or aatankwaadiyon ke khilaaf karrwai hoti rahegi
 'POK will be included in India' Hansraj Ahir said about Pakistan-occupied Kashmir that Pakistan occupied Kashmir is ours and one day it will come when we will take POK to India
 ham usko nahin chodenge
 It is noteworthy that the Indian Army has been running Operation All Out in Jammu and Kashmir, under which the army has killed many terrorists and terrorist commanders of terrorist organizations in the last few months
 somvaar ko hue muthbhed main maare gaye aatankiyon ke paas se aike 46 or pistal ke alaava ek em4 raifal bhi baraamad hui he, jise pakistani sena istemaal karti he
 The government is facing shortage of grain reserves due to bad crop due to weather
 aise main sarkaar kisaanon se gehun or dhan kharidne par vichaar kar rahi he
 According to the English newspaper The Indian Express Kikhabar, the government is refraining from opposition from the decision to buy the crop
 'da food korporation of india' (epasiai) or rajya agency 2014-15 kaa ab tak sirf 26
 Has received 14 million tonnes of crop
 2013-14 kii tulana main gehun kii utpaadakta 95
 90 compared to 85 meters
 78 meter tak gir chuki he, jabaki sarkaar ne minimum saport price (emspi) ko 1400 rupee prati quintal sebadhaakar 1450prati quintal kar diya he
 In such a situation, there is no shortage of food grains for consumption in the country, so the government is trying to keep the stock full by purchasing grain from the farmers

 During interrogation of the terrorists caught in Gorakhpur in Uttar Pradesh, it has been found that bjp's PM candidate Narendra Modi tops the list of terrorists

 In the last two decades, there has been an army of confident Indians who feel that the war in India's bureaucracy will be lifted due to economic growth, prosperity of the middle class, expansion of technology and exposure to the world
 yah ummid thi ki ubharate bharat or kahil-naakaara naukarshahi ke bich kaa faasla ghatega
 However, in the bureaucracy too, there are a few smart people

 Unlike this enraged French policeman, who always makes huge mistakes to achieve success, the efforts of our powerful Home Ministry and its cyber spies have proved to be horribly reversing
 is puri kavayad ke baad sarkaar anaadi, kattar or bevakoof sabit hui
 Babu's senselessness about social media was the root of this huge misery
 babu log lambey samay se ek sangathit media (print or electronic) ke abhyast rahe hai, jinke bare main mana jaataa he ki shashan main uskaa bhi hit hota he jisaki vajah se use niyantrit or naram kar sakate hai
 This time he was confronted with a new breed of agitators who were naturally irreverent and careless
 maujuud aankade bataate hai ki sirf 1
 Only 3 crore Indians (just one per cent of the population) have Twitter accounts
 iskaa or baarik vishleshan kiya jaae to pataa chalata he ki zyaadaatar sakriy twitareti (twit karne vaale) 40 varsh se kam umr ke, graduate yaa ucch shiksha main adhyayanrat or angreji main thik-thaak samvaad kar sakane vaale hai
 In political positions, they can be considered as insignificant and even non-voting groups
 yah baat zyada jaruri tathyon ko chipa detii he
 First, because of their education and geographically spread across India (and of course as migrants all over the world), Twitter and, to a lesser extent, Facebook, have become alternative means of public opinion and news dissemination
 ab khabaron ko dabaanaa ek tarah se asambhav hi ho gaya he
 Secondly, the reason for its alternative taking place is largely due to the growing dissatisfaction with the mainstream media
 twitor par sarsari najar daalane se pataa chalata he ki soshal media main yah soch ghar kar gai he ki mukhyadhara kaa media pakshpaati, bhramit or samanaantar agenda par kaam karne vaala he or uski baat ko antim satya nahin mana ja saktaa
 It was also argued that the Twitter community in India is occupied by right-wing Hindu nationalists
 yah daawa kuch badha-chadha kar kiya gaya ho saktaa he, par is baat main jaraa bhi andeh nahin he ki narendra modi twitatiyon ke pasandida netaa ke rup main ubhare hai
 This is undoubtedly in part due to Modi's charisma and decision-making ability and his image as a no-nonsense leader
 isaki ek badi vajah yah soch bhi he ki mukhyadhara kaa media anuchit rup se modi ko villen banaata rahaa he
 Ultimately Twitter comments have emerged as an alternative to the dominant left-liberal argument in public life in India
 udaaravaadi bharat ko mukhyadhara kaa media main achche se jagah milti rahi he
 It does not need much to look for an alternative platform
 phir bhi, soshal media andolankariyon ko krantikari nahin kaha ja saktaa, unhen bas satta pratishthan virdohi mana ja saktaa he
 Lastly, Twitter's messages are a bit harsh, teasing people who think that moderate English is the language of speakers
 isaki kaaphi had tak vajah andolankariyon main bhadrata kii kami nahin balki 140 shabdon kii vah seemaa he jo is plateform dwaara sandeshon ke liye thopi gai he
 This brevity has given rise to shrill, straight slap-like messages that seem annoying, disgusting to liberals who have access to the mainstream, but attract those who cannot keep their voices elsewhere
 ek aisi sarkaar jo niyantran or regulation par chalati he, jo arajak he, use vichaaron or khabaron kaa yah mukt bazaar baichaiyn karne vaala or vidhvansak lag rahaa he
 Sonia Gandhi and her son can be mercilessly attacked and condemned and made fun of by the Prime Minister, the fact that the official ruling is blasphemous and treasonous
 isse zyada kudhane vaale mantri or adhikari kaaphi lambey samay se internet or khaskar soshal media ko ek 'regulation' ke tahat laane kii koshishon main lage hai
 The ridiculous action taken on Internet sites and social media to cover peace and strengthen national security in the aftermath of the Assam riots was part of this attempt to wring the arm
 yah aashwast karne vaali baat he ki yah kavayad foohad thi
 There is no need for such censorship in India which aims to stifle the anger of those who feel isolated from Big Media

 He defended the cinema world and said that this is the place that unites people under one roof
 amitabh ne kaha ki bahut se log bahut sari baton or kamajoriyon ke liye bhartiya cinema ko koste hai
 i say that when many people gather in a cinema hall to watch a film, then the person, sitting next to them, does not ask for their caste, religion or color

 amitabh ne kaha ki film dekhte hue ham ek hi baat par hansate hai, ek hi drishy par bhavuk hote hai, ek hi sangeet kaa anand lete hai
 i believe that there are few institutions in the world that can claim such integrity, which is seen in Cinemahal

 On the issue of the CAG crossing its jurisdiction, Rai believes that Indian democracy is maturing now and the urban middle class is now taking more interest in matters related to the civil sector
 ‘yah maanate huye ki aakhir main saarvajanik taur par hone vaale vyay main sabase badi hissedaar janata hi he, ham naye raste par aage badhate rahenge

 Rai said that the public auditor is also engaged in the work of improving governmental governance and administration operations in the same way that other agencies of administration are engaged in this work
 unhone kaha, ‘lekhapariksha karte huye ham apane ko unki tarah nahin balki khud ko unke sthaan par bithakar sthitiyon ko dekhte hai
 Our audit line is undergoing a change, we are now reporting in a positive way
 ’raay ne kaha ki janata ke paise ke istemaal kii lekhapariksha karne vaale saarvajanik lekhapareekshak ko uddeshyparak or vishwasaneey hona chaiye
 He said, 'we can gain confidence only when we have better credit, will be able and will be free of control

 Former captain of the Indian football team and star striker Sunil Chhetri admitted that Oman's team is better than the Indian team
 lekin saath hi unhone yah bhi kaha ki 2018 fifa footbal vishwa cap kwalifyres ke duusare round ke apane pehle mukaable main jab bhartiya team oman ke viruddh utregi to team par koi dabaav nahin hoga
 In response to a question related to India's prospects against Oman, Chhetri said we know that we are going to play against a good team, Oman's team is better than us
 hamen apana sarvshereshth dene or sakaaratmak maansikta se khilne kii jarurat he jisase pratidwandi team ko kadi chunauti mili
 In the press conference held on the eve of the match, he said that we have young players who are away from any kind of pressure or tension
 yah hamaare liye madadgaar sabit hoga
 When asked about military training, Chhetri said, "the training was good; it will help us to reconcile with each other
" lekin yah aisi cheez nahin he jo nirnaayak sabit ho sakati he
 Chhetri was asked whether a good and bad session meant for him in terms of goals
 So he said if you look at the figures of this session of mine, i would honestly say that it matters to me
 sunil chhetri is satr main abhi tak khele 28 maichon main sirf 11 gol hi kar paae hai

 The country is going through a serious phase
 is gambhirtha ke kaaran hamen gambhirtha ke daure padane lage hai
 Scientists from all over the world are researching that India should not leave all countries behind in a serious way
 aaj koi kah rahaa tha ki ham bharat ke log kii jagah ham bharat ke gambhir log likhaa hona chahie
 If there is a burden of seriousness, then it is here, it is here
 isse pehle ki hamaari naagarikta bhartiyata ke saath saath gambhirtha bhi ho jaae ek suzav aa gaya he
 And this suggestion is given by our Prime Minister Narendra Modi, not by anyone else
 ve is baat ko lekar gambhir hai ki sansad main hasya-vinod kam ho gaya he
 But it does not look like seeing laughing pictures of ministers and leaders in government advertisements
 in tasveeron main ve hansate-hansate 'still' ho gaye hai lekin 'real life' main unki hansi kisi ne 'steel' kar lee he yani chura lee he
 Occasions of comic satire in the Parliament are frequently interrupted, but the issues are such that the latitude and longitude lines of seriousness get darker on their faces
 hamaare saansad kaam bahut karte hai or ye baat main gambhirtha se kah rahaa hum
 Representing a million people, listening to problems, going to events ranging from mourning to joy, doing government work, parliamentary work, more than 'to mach'
 ek baar saansad chunane ke baad ham apni sari ummiden un par transfar kar dete hai or wo puri karte-karte yahaan se vahaan transfar hote rahete hai
 That is why there should be laughter break along with lunch break or laughter humor period like question time
 bas aaj ek din ke liye thodi atirikt azaadi lekar ham saansadon par tikaa-tippanee kar rahe hai
 There is no other intention than this
 hamen pataa he ki 14 agast ko rajyasabha main saansad jaya bachchan ji ne yah baat kahi he ki ek privet efem kaa radio jocky saansadon yaa netaaon kaa mazaaq uda rahaa tha
 Was using abusive language
 unhone kaha ki radio jaukiyon ne sansad kii khabaren dena shuru kar diya he or ve bahut saare saansadon kii nakal karte hai
 Jaya ji wanted to know what the government would do about it
 soochna prasaaran mantri prakaash jaavdekar ji ne bhi kah diya ki saansadon kaa mazaaq udaane yaa unki awaz nikaalane vaale epa em radio jocky par karrwai kii jaaegi
 Social media is shocked by Jaya Ji's complaint
 ab ye jaanakar main bhi saham gaya ki aaj hasya vyangy par prime time karun ki na karun
 To satirize the proceedings of Parliament, the use of bicameral dialogues or vulgar language should be avoided
 magar mantri kii file se tay hoga yaa saansad kii profile se
 There is also an appeal to Javadekar ji that if he is not the one to protect the satire, then how will we follow the Prime Minister's appeal that there is a lack of humor
 hasya vinod or mazaaq main fark hota he
 i want to ask some questions like an anchor asking questions, understanding this fine difference
 kya pradhanmantri ko sirf sansad main hasya vinod kii kami dikhti he
 Do they not see the lack of it in the country
 ve kab-kab hansate hai or ve kab-kab nahin hansate hai
 They should answer these four questions with laughter
 ek aakhri sawaal ki kya ve agle kisi satr main akhil bhartiya hansi vidheyak laane kii soch rahe hai
 If yes, please explain why no serious efforts have been made so far
 kyon hamaara desh hasya kuposhan ke kaaran sanyukt raashtra kii lofter report main bangladesh se bhi neeche he
 Well, there is no such report, but if it comes someday
 lekin tab kya kijiyegaa jab koi modi virdohi aarope laga de ki unke piem banate hi gambhirtha ghat gai he
 Vinod itself is humor
 kuch log gambhirtha bachaao andolan shuru kar sakate hai
 Some people can count on their laughter and count all the circumstances of the country and start crying, and one day it may come when they have to call an all-party meeting on the satire
 phir bhi hamane sochaa ki 15 agast ke maukey par hansi kii gambhirtha par bahes kii jaae
 Do we really laugh less? kahin aisa to nahin ki ham khud se nahin hansate hai
 But if someone laughs, he laughs
 agar ham khud se hansane vaale hote to kapil dev ke rahete kapil sharma kaise lokapriy ho jate
 Kapil Sharma is a brand today
 un chizon ke bhi brands hai jinka hansi se koi lenaa-dena nahin
 We have heard that Kapil ji is such a big brand that he does not advertise anything that is not useful for him
 koi film buree ban jaati he to log hasya sant kapil sharma kii sharan main aate hai
 If Kapil Sharma does not come on TV at night, then people do not laugh even the next day
 amritsar kaa yah noujvaan hansate hansate karodpati ban gaya
 Our present-day guests have become mps from the Aam Aadmi Party, laughing and laughing
 hamaare ek or mehmaan raju shrivastav bhi saansad hote hote batch gaye
 While going to SP, Modi said that if you go there, you will laugh and come to BJP
 achche din aane vaale hai
 The reasons for the remaining guests Sunil Pal, Dinesh Bawra and Pratap Faujdar were not yet able to become mps
 phir bhi ye sabhi kinhin agyaat kaarnon se vikhyath ho gaye hai
 But today it has been received in prime time to make you laugh on the occasion of 15 August
 ummid he ki ham kisi line ko cross nahin karenge
 Religion, caste or anti-women will not be used in jumla
 maine apane mehmaanon ko bulaate samay sharten lagu, to kaha tha magar galati inaki he ki inhone nahin suna tha
 In order to change the lives of girls in India, actress Priyanka Chopra and Freida Pinto have started the 'girl Rising India' campaign
 ek vijyapti main kaha gaya he ki ‘girl rising india’ ko ladakiyon ke liye jamini str par chetana paidaa karne tathaa badlaav ke liye taiyaar kiya gaya he
 Freida said, 'now the time has come that instead of saying why we should educate girls, we should say why not teach
 jab ham jaanate hai ki ladakiyon ko shikshit karke duniya ko badal sakate hai, to phir intjaar kyon? is abhiyaan ke jariye ham badalenge
 Priyanka said, 'I have been a part of the' Girl Rising India 'campaign since the beginning and feel honored to bring this powerful idea to India

 He said that a permanent solution can be arrived at only with the cooperation of both sides

 While Kangana's lawyer defended him, now Hrithik's spokespersons have come in his support
 unhone kangana or rangoli ke ek-ek sawaalon kaa jawaab diya he
 Kangana accused Hrithik of hacking e-mail ids
 iske jawaab main rithik ke spoxperson ne kaha he, 'kangana kahati hai ki rithik ne unki i-mail ai-di hack kar lee or khud ko hi mail kar die
 But how will Hrithik know what Kangana has done throughout the day
 saath hi ve kis-kis se mili hai
 How can Hrithik write Kangana's daily routine? All these allegations are an insult to the National Common Sense '

 is photo ke saath kis tarah ched-chhaad kii gai he, aap khud dekhen
 During the promotion of his film Simran, Kangana continuously revealed Hrithik and many things related to his relationship in response to questions asked on personal relationships
 magar ek baar bhi rithik kii taraf se is masale par kuch nahin kaha gaya
 Now that he has broken the silence on this dispute that has been going on for almost two years, the reason behind it is also big

 teen saal ke modi sarkaar ke kaarykaal ke dauraan rail mantralay kii sabase badi chunauti bhartiya rail kii ausat raftaar ko maujuuda 80 kilometre prati ghanta se badhaakar pehle 170 kilometre karne kii thi
 This record was intended to increase the passenger and freight capacity of the Indian Railways, as well as to prepare it to fire a bullet at a speed of 300 km
 lekin raftaar kii is kavayad main railway ke saamne suraksha kii badi chunauti khadi ho gai jiske chalate modi sarkaar ko rail mantri suresh prabhu kaa vikalp dena padaa
 Significantly, after the Modi government's most important cabinet expansion so far, Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu tweeted and congratulated his 13 lakh colleagues of the Railway Ministry and gave a clear indication that his departure from the Railway Ministry is certain
 lihaaja, ab rail mantri ke taur par modi sarkaar ek nae chehre ko saamne laane ja rahi he
 At the same time, it has also become clear that Suresh Prabhu will be given the responsibility of the new ministry
 gauratlab he ki bhartiya rail kii sabase badi chunauti ko puraa karne ke liye jahaan apane kaarykaal ke dauraan rail mantri suresh prabhu ne gatiman express ko 160 kilometre prati ghante kii raftaar se dilli se agra tak daudaya vahiin dilli se mumbai tak ke safar ko 12 ghante main puraa karne ke liye talgo kaa safal pareekshan bhi kiya
 Talgo has given important direction to the Railway Ministry to increase its speed by completing the journey from Delhi to Mumbai in 4 hours less than Rajdhani Express
 lekin is koshish ko dhakka bhi beete maheene hue teen rail haadason se laga jisane sabase bada sawaal yah khadaa kiya ki kya bullate train daudane kii kavayad main rail mantralay ne suraksha ke maapdand ko darkinar kar diya
 Any major changes in the ministry during the last three years are still awaited
 isi koshish main rail mantralay ko maujuuda vitt varsh se vaarshik bajet banane kii jimmedaari lekar sidhe vitt mantralay ko de di gai
 Despite this, no attempt to bring Indian Railways on track seems to have paid off
 beete kuch maheenon se ho rahe rail haadase or din prati din kharaab hoti yatri suvidhaon se modi sarkaar dabaav main hai ki vah rail ko nayaa mantri den nahin 2022 ke torget se pehle 2019 ke chunaavon main uski saakh par batta laga rahegaa

 modi sarkaar bhi cashles arthvyavastha par jor de rahaa he
 But when you sit to book a railway ticket, a very lucky type of person gets a confirmed ticket
 adhiktar log vatting tikat hi book kar pate hai or yatra ke antim daur tak pienaar states check karte rahete hai
 To improve this, some schemes were run by the Railways, especially 'dynamic Fair' and Tatkal tickets
 tatkaal tikat par lakh paabandiyon ke baavjood aasaani se tikat hasil karnaa tedi kheer he jabaki dianmik fere pranali main yah aasaan he
 But it is so expensive that it is not suitable for the common man

 Passenger congestion: Around 2 in the country by Indian Railways
 5 karod log pratidin safar karte hai
 This is the reason why you get crowds on every occasion of rail journey
 sabase pehle tikat counter par, vatting room main, train main savaar hone ke liye (khaskar general dibbe), food stall par, pine vaale pani ke liye nalon tak lambii-lambii line lagi rahati he
 To eliminate this congestion, the need was to change the entire railway structure, but it could not be started during the tenure of Suresh Prabhu
 train kii khastahal suvidhaayentrain main aap chadh gaye or agar aap kaa tikat vaataanukoolit shrenee kaa nahin he to aap safar nahin balki 'safar' karte hai
 The reason is old cans, dirt under the seats and dirty toilets

 The picture of the rail will change from the station

 saavadhi jamaa yojana yani phixd diposit (FD) par 9
 The annual interest rate of 50 per cent will certainly attract, especially in the case of commercial banks fds of 7 to 7
 5 fisadi kii byaaj dar de rahe hon
 State Bank of India, ie SBI, is paying an interest rate of 7% per annum on a three-year FD
 vahiin duusari ore kooparative bank or municipal kooparative bank isi machority turm par 8
 50–9
 50 fisadi kii dar se byaaj de rahe hai
 This means that if a person deposits an FD of Rs 10 lakh for five years in a cooperative or municipal co-operative bank, then he can earn Rs 1 lakh more than the interest earned on other fds
 yahi vajah he ki ritair hone vaale zyaadaatar log jo ki regular masik inakam chaahate hai or iske liye badi rakam nivesh main daalate hai, ve paaramparik epady ke mukaable kooparative bank ke epady ke prati zyada aakarshith hote hai
 However, several cooperative banks have also failed
 kooparative bainkon ke mukaable karmshal bank adhik niyam-kanoonon se bandhe hote hai or sambhavat: unamem customers ke hit apekshaakrit adhik surakshit hote hai
 The financial position of cooperative banks is not as easily available as that of a working bank
 deal four lons (deal4loans) ke sansthaapak rishi mehara kehete hai- ateet main kai kooparative bank dharashayi ho gaye hai, aise main bas kuch 1
 It is not right to take a risk for a higher interest rate of 5-2 per cent
 unke mutabik, kooparative bank jis aria main oparate karte hai, vahaan ke sthaneey kisaanon or laghu udhyam karne waalon ko lone dete hai, aise main ve isliye bhi asafalataa sambandhi jokhim adhik hota he kyonki lone ek hi sector main die ja rahe hai
 The comments haalanki niveshak kii nivesh kii gai rakam kaa 1 lakh rupaya diposit insurance skim ke tahat kooparative bainkon main bhi bimit hota he, thik vaise hi jaise ki rashtriyakrut bainkon ke maamle main hota he
 Therefore, experts say that whatever money you want to invest, do it in different banks and not in one bank at the same time
 yadi aapako do lakh rupye nivesh karne hai to ise do kooparative bainkon main daal den
 There is one more thing besides this
 kabhi kabhi bank ke fail hone kii disha main sarkaar paisa nikaalane kii seemaa tay kar detii he
 According to Mehra, in such a situation, the government wants to give time to the cooperative bank, but it becomes a mess for the custom
 iskaa arth yah hua ki yadi koi vyakti paanch saal ke liye 10 lakh rupye kii epady kooparative yaa municipal koparative bank main karata he to vah apekshaakrit bahut adhik yani anya epady par byaaj kii kamai se 1 lakh rupye adhik byaaj kama saktaa he
 This is the reason that most of the retirees who want regular monthly income and invest large amount of money for this are more attracted to the FD of the cooperative bank than the traditional FD
 kai kooparative banks haalanki asafal bhi hue hai
 Working banks are bound by more laws and regulations than cooperative banks, and customers' interests are probably more secure in them
 karmshal bank ke mukaable kooparative bainkon kii vittiya sthiti utani aasaani se uplabdh nahin hoti he
 Rishi Mehra, founder of deal4loans, says many cooperative banks have collapsed in the past, just a few
 5-2 fisadi adhik byaaj dar ke liye jokhim lenaa sahi nahin he
 According to him, the cooperative banks give loans to local farmers and small entrepreneurs in the area in which they operate, so they are also at higher risk of failure because the loans are being given in the same sector
 tippaniyan However, 1 lakh rupees of the investor's invested amount is also insured in cooperative banks under the deposit insurance scheme, just as in the case of nationalized banks
 isliye visheshgy kehete hai ki jitna bhi paisa nivesh karnaa he use vibhinn bainkon main karen, na ki ekasaath kisi ek hi bank main karen
 If you have to invest two lakh rupees then put it in two cooperative banks
 iske alaava ek or baat he

 While Nanabhau Mohod received 69257 votes, Bhagwat Mahajan got 60841 votes

 Talking about the 2008 elections, this time the bjp's Nanabhau Mohod won
 is baar haarane vaale the congress ke yuvaraj jichakar
 Nanabhau received 43082 votes while Yuvraj Zichkar of Congress got 40202 votes
 is baar hone vaale chunaav ke liye bijepi ek baar phir vartmaan vidhayak nanabhau mohod ko utaar sakati he
 It is believed that the Congress can field Kamal Nath's son Nakulnath this time
 kapaas or santare kii kheti ke baavjood yahaan ke kisaan samasyaayein se jujh rahe hai

 Apart from farming, there is no employment

 The 2013 election results in Madhya Pradesh have a total of 231 assembly seats
 230 siton par chunaav hote hai jabaki ek sadsy ko manonith kiya jaataa he
 In the 2013 elections, BJP got 165 seats, Congress 58, BSP 4 and others three seats
 madhya pradesh vah rajya he, jahaan congress san 2003 se hi satta se baahar he
 If the Congress, which was in power under the leadership of Digvijay Singh from 1993 to 2003, came out of power, it did not return till today
 uma bharti ke netritv main bijepi ne sarkaar bana lee, tirangaa yatra ke vivaad ke baad uma hatin, to shivaraj aaye jo aaj tak jame hai
 Digvijay Singh went into the politics of Delhi since losing the election, in 2003 he had declared that if he loses, he will not contest the election for 10 years
 tamaam bade diggajon se bhare pradesh main is bich koi teesri siyaasi taaqat bhi nahin ubhari or aamane saamne kii ladaai congress jeet na saki
 In fact, Shivraj made BJP the surveyor in Madhya Pradesh, while the Congress only struggled with mutual head-to-head
 aaj bhi haal vahi he ki, itnaa bada kisaanon kaa mudda milane ke baavjood party ekajute or aakraamak hokar kisaanon kii hamdard dikhne kii bajaay baikfoot par he, ulte uske kuch local netaaon ke saamne aae video clip us par saazishakarta hone kaa aarope madh rahe hai
 If you look at it in a sequential manner, when the farmers were shot in Mandsaur, the farmers died, then the big leaders of the state would wake up
 usase pehle sthaneey vidhayak or netaa hi apane str se lage the, kisaanon kaa itnaa bada andolan ho rahaa tha, lekin congress nadaarad dikhi
 Till before the assassination of farmer-stricken, leader Mastakisans, leaders like Digvijay Singh, Kamal Nath, Jyotiraditya Scindia, Suresh Pachauri, Kantilal Bhuria, Legislature Party leader Ajay Singh, Speaker Arun Yadav, Satyavrat Chaturvedi and Rahul's close former MP from Mandsaur Meenakshi Natarajan - Was busy with his politics
 upar se in bade netaaon kii tulana main prabharee mahasachiv mohan prakaash kaa qad aisa nahin ki, wo sabko ekajute kar saken
 It is said that leaders like Digvijay, Scindia and Kamal Nath prefer to speak directly to the high command rather than Mohan Prakash
 darasal, vidhansabha chunaav main party kaa siem kaa cheharaa koun hoga, isi uhapoh main saare netaa vyast the or aaj bhi hai
 The political game was at the peak of news of the formation of any one in Kamal Nath and Scindia and it is still today, but due to the official announcement being stuck, the incident of Mandsaur was not much attention
 kisaanon kii hatya kii khabar aane ke baad rahul gandhi sakriy hue, unki taraf se pradesh netaaon ko sakriy hone kii taakid kii gai
 Then Meenakshi Natarajan, Bhuria, Ajay Singh and Arun Yadav were forced to go to Mandsaur 
 us vaqt digvijay singh dilli main the, unhone bayaan dekar apana kaam kiya or kaha ki, sanghathan kahegaa to wo mandsaur jaaenge
 So recently, Kamal Nath, who returned from abroad, was going to visit Badrinath and Kedarnath
 vahiin, bete ke ilaaj ke liye sindhiya videsh ravaanaa ho chuke the
 In a hurry, without the permission of the administration, Rahul made a plan to go to Mandsaur
 udhar, kharaab mausam ke chalate kamalnath pahaado main nahin ja sake or dilli waapas aa gaye
 In such a situation, Rahul went to Udaipur with Kamal Nath, Digvijay and Mohan Prakash from the ship and then the incident of Rahul remained in the headlines throughout the day
 par rahul laute to phir vahi haal
 When Digvijay froze in Delhi, Kamal Nath went to Delhi to visit Tirupati and Scindia was not in the country
 is bich local netaaon ke video cliping saamne aae, jisane bijepi ko congress par saazish ke tahatahinsa failaane kaarope lagane kaa mauka de diya or party baikfoot par aati dikhi
 Meanwhile, Scindia returned Monday, 10 days before leaving the son's treatment
 agle paanch din ve madhya pradesh main rahenge, 14 june se 3 din kaa bhopal main satyagrah bhi karenge, phir 18 ko dilli waapas aa jaaenge
 Overall, he too has the intention to remain in the political fight of the organization, because he was not in the country in this entire sentence
 koun ho siem cheharaakhir jis mudde ke zarie party bijepi kii empi sarkaar ko baikfoot par laa sakati thi, usee masale par uskaa baikfoot par dikhnaa uske liye bada jhatka he, jiske peeche kii vajah ye he ki, siem kaa cheharaa koun ho is sawaal par sab thande pade hai
 When someone gets a command, then he wants to be active with his strength
 uske pehle bhala wo duusare ke liye kyon zamin taiyaar kare
 The party is unable to recover from this mutual quarrel
 sindhiya ko cheharaa banane se kamalnath, digvijay, pachori sareekhon se bhitarghaat kaa dar he, to kamalnath ke banane par satyavrath or sindhiya kii khamoshi party ke liye chintaa kaa sabab ban sakati he
 The high command has been entangled in this mindset and due to the mutual split, delay in the decision, the party has become an enigma in the state
 aakhir yahi vajah hai ki, teesri taaqat kii gairmaujuudagi, thik-thaak sanghathan or bade netaaon kii fouj ke baavjood wo 14 saal se satta se baahar he or itnaa bada kisaanon kii hatya kaa mudda haath aane par bhi haath nishaan vaali party haath malati hi dikh rahi he

 pashchim bengal ke singur main tata ke saath jo hua use ek baar phir doharaaya gaya he
 This time Tata has to make his return from Bastar in Chhattisgarh
 bastar main lohandiguda ilaake main tata ne saadhe paanch million ton salanaa kshamta vaale steel plant ko sthapit karne kii kavayat shuru kii
 Spent more than 200 crores for this
 tata ne paanch hajaar paanch sau acre kii jameen bhi adhigrahit kii
 No more land was available for the expansion of the plant as the Naxalites started opposing the plant
 yahaan tak kii naksaliyon ne tata ko aayran ore kii khadaanon main kaam tak shuru nahin karne diya
 After a long wait, Tata has duly called Chhattisgarh by-bye
 bastar main bharpoor maatra main aayran ore kii khadanenchhattisgarhke bastar se tata steel kii vidaai ho gai he
 In 2005, Tata had signed a MOU with the Government of Chhattisgarh to set up a five and a half tonne per annum steel plant in Lohandiguda area as Bastar has abundant iron ore mines
 lihaaja rajya sarkaar ne bhi furti dikhaai or tata ko aayran ore kii khadaane bhi aavantit kar di
 With this, the practice of land acquisition for the plant started
 lohandiguda or uske aasapaas ke das gaanv kii paanch hajaar paanch sau acre jameen style plant kii sthapana ke liye chinhit kii gai
 It was also acquired successfully
 ilaake ke logon ko tata ne rajya sarkaar ke madhyam se muaavje kii rakam bhi baant di
 After this, the hour of trouble for Tata came when the Naxalites opened the front regarding land acquisition and iron ore mines
 iske baad plant ke vistaar ke liye naa to tata ko jameen muhaiyaa ho pai or naa hi naksaliyon ne aayran ore khadaanon ko shuru nahin hone diya
 As a result, Tata has pulled out of the plant
 tata ne kii kaaphi mashkkatain das saalon main tata ne steel plant kii sthapana ko lekar do darjan gaanv main jamkar papad bele
 From the welfare of the local people, he taught them a lot of lessons about a better future
 ilaake ke kayakalp se lekar vikaas kaa vaada bhi kiya, lekin maahaul tata ke paksh main nahin ho paaya
 After receiving compensation, most villagers refused to give land at the behest of the Naxalites
 natijatan adhigrahit kii gai jameen tata ko nahin mil pai
 The state government also claimed to have removed the unaccounted possession from the acquired land, but Tata could not get satisfactory assistance
 apni jameen waapas maang rahe hai adivasaitata ne apane plant ke liye bandaji , badaparoda , belar , beliapal , chhindgaanv , daapapal , ghurgaanv , kamali , sirisguda or taakaraguda gaanv kii paanch hajaar paanch sau acre jameen kaa adhigrahan kar bhoomi maalikon ko uskaa muaavja bhi de diya
 Of the 1707 tribals, 1163 took the compensation amount through banks into their account, but the remaining nearly five and a half tribals started a rebellion over the acquisition
 naksali bhi is abhiyaan main jute gaye or unhone tata steel plant ke karmiyon or samarthakon ko ilaake se khadedna shuru kar diya
 Due to Naxal operations at gunpoint, the work of setting up the steel plant came to a standstill
 ab is ilaake ke log apni jameen kii vaapasi kii maang kar rahe hai
 The people of the area allege that the Tatas are leaving due to the weakness of the state government
 isamen unka koi dosha nahin he
 Therefore their land should be returned
 naksaliyon ke kaaran hui tata kii vidaayeeudhar jis vakt tata kii vidaai ho rahi thi, us vakt rajya ke mukhyamantri raman singh raipur main udyogpatiyon ke saath baithak main mashgool the
 His agenda was government efforts for safe investment and industrialization in the state
 tata kii vidaai ko lekar sarkaar kaa apana tark he
 According to Raman Singh, Tata had to go to the area due to the inability to open mines due to Naxalite opposition, but many more industrial units are being set up in this area
 tata ke jane ke baad nagarnar main doosraa steel plant aa gaya he
 20 thousand crore is to be invested in it
 land bank main shaamil hui adhigrahit jaminenudhar gramin ab apni jameen kii vaapasi kii maang karne lage hai
 It is being argued that the Supreme Court rejected the land acquisition of the then government for the Tata Nano project in Singur
 isse adhigrahit jameen kii vaapasi bhi tay ho gai, lekinchhattisgarh sarkaarne tata ke liye adhigrahit jameen ko land bank main shaamil kiye jane kaa faisla kiya he
 For this, a resolution has also been passed in the Cabinet
 sarkaar ne yah bhi elaan kiya he ki is jameen ko un audyogic gharaanon ko aavantit kiya jayega, jo bastar main nivesh karenge

 maithani ne aarope lagaaya ki swami ke kaarykram ke bare main jila prashasan or police prashasan ko pehle se soochna de di gai thi, iske baavjood police ne unki suraksha kaa koi intjaam nahin kiya

 reality sho ko karan johar or rohit shetty jaj kar rahe hai
 Starting on a good note, a bad news is coming out about this show
 sutron se hawaale se kaha ja rahaa he ki karan wahi ko sho se hataaya ja saktaa he
 As reported by Spotboye, the show's makers believe that Karan is not able to make as much time for the show due to his busy schedule
 khabar to ye bhi he ki unki jagah par bharti singh, aditya narayan, roshal raav or krishna abhishek se baatcheet chal rahi he
 There is talk of replacing Karan Wahi after 4-5 episodes of the show
 a post shared by Star Plus (@starplus)onjan 13, 2018 at 5:29am pstkamgana ranot boleen- apane mehmaanon ko jehar pilaate hai karan johar!karan wahi ke pravaktaa se is bare main poocha gaya to unhone kaha ki actor 'intertenment kii raat' or 'indiaj next superstars' main badi sahajata ke saath kaam kar rahe hai
 They are hosting both shows without any problems
 bataa den, rithwik dhanajaani isse pehle super dancer-2 ko host kar rahe the
 But to back his full focus on 'india's Next Superstars', he backed out of the old show
 kangana kii controvarsi par karan ne diya jawaab, kaha- istemaal ho rahi hai kanganasho ko lekar karan johar ne ek intervyuu ke dauraan kaha tha ki maujuuda daur main singing or daancing ko lekar kai saare sho ban rahe hai
 But not many shows are made about acting
 hamen ummid he ki yah sho desh ko badhiya actors degaa or is sho ke jariye kai saare kaabil log apana bhavishya ujjwal bana paaenge

 sidney test se team india main nae yug kii shuruyaat ho rahi he
 Virat Kohli has been made the full-time Test captain
 lekin viraat ke dipti kii bare main suspence abhi tak barkaraar he
 According to BCCI policy, the team selectors never choose vice-captains in the domestic series, but the name of the vice-captain has always been announced on foreign tours
 magar dhoni ke test se sanyas lene ke baad abhi tak is par koi baatcheet nahin hui he
 It is expected that the team management will decide on the first day of the Sydney Test
 haalanki chayankartaaon ko yah baat hazm hogi isaki koi ganrti nahin he
 The race currently consists of Tan Names - Ishant Sharma, Ajinkya Rahane and r Ashwin
 eshanth kii jahaan tak baat he to wo is vakt team main sabase anbhavi khilaadi he
 Ishant has played 61 Test matches
 haalanki in 61 test maichon main unhone 37 ran har wicket ke liye lutaae, 2014 main unka pradarshan behatar tha, jahaan unhone 31
 Took 38 wickets at an average of 36
 ajinkya rahane ke paksh main kai baaten hai
 He is part of the team in every format and is known for his calm behavior
 videsh main unka pradarshan thik rahaa he
 He has 1026 runs in 13 Tests, including three centuries
 aar aswin kaa naam bhi charchaa main hai, lekin videsh main kai baar aswin plaing 11 kaa bhi hissaa nahin hote isliye unke naam par muhar laganaa mushkil he
 It is sure that there will be a long debate on the number two in the team in board politics, it may be that along with different captains in Test and one-day, different vice-captains can also be seen
 gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi kii piem daavedaari kii jarurat kahie yaa phir bhartiya janata party kii majaburi
 In the wake of the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP is looking to give up its old friends and join hands with new allies
 isaki pehali bhanak party ke maharashtra pradesh adhyaksh devendra fadanvis or maharashtra navnirmaan sena supremeo raaj thakare kii baithak se mili
 It seems that repeated targeting of Modi by Uddhav Thackeray's party Shiv Sena may create new political equations in Maharashtra
 darasal, buudhvaar ko devendra fadanvis raaj thakare se unke awaas par mili
 The meeting between the two leaders lasted about one and a half hours in a closed room
 is meeting ke baad endie main siyaasi sameekaran badalane ko lekar kayaas lagaae ja rahe hai
 Significantly, in Goa, the party's national executive meeting to be held from June 7, where there is a preparation to hand over the command of the election campaign committee to Modi on one side
 vahiin, endie ke kunbe ko badhaane ko lekar bhi charchaa hogi
 In such a situation, this meeting of the two leaders has many meanings
 sutron ke hawaale se khabar he ki bijepi emenes ko endie kaa hissaa bananaa chaahati he
 And this alliance will continue not only in the Lok Sabha elections but also in the Maharashtra Assembly elections
 haalanki bijepi ke rajya main mukhiya ne in khabaron ko atakalein bataaya he, magar unke kareebi sutron kii maane to jab tak sab kuch fiks or final nahin ho jaataa, tab tak public main aisa hi kaha jayega
 Now the question arises that if MNS comes with BJP then what will happen to the existing Shiv sena-bjp alliance? Because Shiv Sena and MNS have rejected the talk of coming together earlier
 to kya enemes ke endie main shaamil hone ke saath hi kai saal purana shivasena-bijepi gathbandhan khatm ho jayega
 And is Modi the reason for this political commotion? Because Modi and Raj Thackeray are well known
 vahiin piem pad kii ummidavaari ke liye sushamaa swaraj ko shivasena kaa samarthan, kahin modi ke 'mishan dilli' ke aade to nahin aa rahaa
 There is still almost a year in the general election, but the political significance of these meetings will come out
 aakhir raajnneeti main dushmani or dosti sarvakalik nahin hoti

 He also discussed racial attacks on Indians in other countries

 ajam khan ne kaha ki ab kalbe javwaad unase dushmani par utaaru hai
 Azam Khan said that without proving anything authentically, an attempt is being made to spoil his image
 ajam khan ke mutabik unka kisi vakf se vyaktigat taur par koi vaasta nahin he
 The building of the Rampur Public School is owned by the orphanage and school trust, not individual

 The answer to this question that has been going on for some time has been found in the form of Rangana Herath
 baayen haath ke is spinner ne australia ke khilaaf gaale main khele ja rahe duusare test main na sirf hetric darj kii balki unki shandaar gendbaaji kii badaulat srilanka, mehmaan australia team ko 106 ran ke score par dher karne main kaamyaab ho gaya
 This is Australia's lowest score against Sri Lanka
 herath kaaphi samay se test main srilanka ke liye pramukh gendbaaj or wicket tekar kii bhoomika nibhaa rahe hai
 The comments gaale test main pehle batting karte hue srilanka ne 281 kaa score banaaya tha
 In response, Australia once seemed to be moving towards a respectable score
 warner or khwaja krij par the or 13 over ke baad mehmaan team kaa score ek wicket par 54 ran tha
 On this score, the wicket fell as soon as Warner was out on Perera's ball
 perera or herath ne milakar australian ballebaaji kii qamar tod di or dekhte hi dekhte puri team 33
 Sitting in the pavilion in 2 overs
 donon hi gendbaajon ne chaar-chaar wicket liye
 Herath took the wickets of Voges, Neville and Stark as a hat-trick
 unke in teen wicket ke kaaran australia kaa score dekhte hi dekhte chaar wicket par 80 ran se saat wicket par 80 ran tak pahunch gaya
 Earlier, Herath also dismissed Australian captain Steve Smith
 herath ab tak 71 test maichon main (gaal test se pehle) 29
 Has taken 313 wickets at an average of 64
 24 baar ve pari main paanch or paanch baar match main das yaa adhik wicket le chuke hai
 Sri Lanka scored a score of 281, batting first in the Galle Test
 iske jawaab main australia ek samay sammanjanak score kii ore badhata najar aa rahaa tha
 Warner and Khwaja were at the crease and after 13 overs the visiting team's score was 54 for one wicket
 isi score par perera kii gend par warner ke out hote hi wicket kii jhadi lag gai
 Perera and Herath broke the back of Australian batting together and the entire team 33
 2 over main pavilion main ja baithi
 Both bowlers took four wickets each
 herath ne hetric ke rup main vogs, nevil or stark ke wicket jatke
 Due to his three wickets, the score of Australia went from 80 for four to 80 for seven
 isse pehle herath ne australian captain steve smith ko bhi out kiya tha
 Herath 29 in 71 Test matches (before cheek test) so far

 yahaan ke number se mujhe bahut trol kiya jaataa he
 If those people really live here, then they are welcome in this hall too

 After picking up the Philippines number when i told my colleagues that i now tell you the language of a troll and i turned the phone on in speaker mode, but a woman's voice came in good English - i came please speak to Mr

 ? (may i please speak to Mr
 Ravish Kumar 
 
 ?) hazaron trol main aaj tak ek bhi mahila kii awaz nahin ai thi
 i immediately removed the phone from speaker mode

 The courageous journalism of Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi and Pir Moonis Mohammed is scared and subdued today
 ab main apane vishay par aata hum
 citizen journalism yah samay naagarik hone ke imtihaan kaa he
 Citizenship has to be re-understood and fought for
 yah jaanate hue ki is samay main naagarikta par chautarafa hamalaa ho rahe hai or satta kii nigaraanee badhati ja rahi he, ek vyakti or ek samooh ke taur par jo is hamale se khud ko bachaa legaa or is ladaai main manj legaa, vahi naagarik bhavishya ke behatar samaaj or sarkaar kii nai buniyaad rakhega
 The world is filled with the stubbornness of such citizens
 nafrat ke maahaul or soochnaaon ke sookhe main koi he, jo is registan main cactus ke phool kii tarah khilaa hua he
 a tree standing in the sand never thinks about what it means to be here, he stands up for others, so that we know that there is greenery in the sand too
 jahaan kahin bhi loktantr hare-bhare maidan se registan main sabawart kiya ja rahaa he, vahaan aaj naagarik hone or soochna par uske adhikari hone kii ladaai thodi mushkil zarur ho gai he
 But it is not impossible
 naagarikta ke liye zaruri he ki soochnaaon kii swatantraaa or pramanikta ho
 Today the state has complete control over the media and its business
 media par control kaa matlab he, aapaki naagarikta kaa dayera chota ho janaa
 The media is now part of the state of surveillance
 vah ab forth estate nahin he, balki first estate he
 The gap between private media and government media has disappeared
 iskaa kaam opinian ko diaversifai nahin karnaa he, balki control karnaa he
 This is happening in many countries of the world including India
 news channelon kii dibet kii bhashaa lagaataar logon ko rashtrawaad ke daayre se baahar nikaalati rahati he
 History and collective memories are being removed and a party's nation and history are being imposed on them
 media kii bhashaa main do tarah ke naagarik hai - ek, neshnal or doosraa, anti-neshnal
 Anti National is the one who questions, disagrees
 asahmati loktantr or naagarikta kii aatma he
 That soul is attacked daily
 jab naagarikta khatare main ho yaa uskaa matlab hi badal diya jaae, tab us naagarik kii patrakarita kisi hogi
 Both are citizens
 jo khud ko neshnal kahata he, or jo anti-neshnal kaha jaataa he
 In many countries of the world, this state system, including the judiciary, has become legitized among the people
 phir bhi ham kashmir or honkong ke udhaaharan se samaj sakate hai ki logon ke bich loktantr or naagarikta kii clasik samaj abhi bhi bachi hui he or ve uske liye sangharsh kar rahe hai
 After all, why the millions of people fighting for democracy in Hong Kong did not trust social media
 unhen us bhashaa par bhi vishwaas nahin rahaa, jise sarkarein jaanati hai
 So he coined his new language and communicated the strategy of movement in it
 yah naagarik hone kii rachanaatmak ladaai he
 Hong Kong citizens are creating new places parallel to places where millions of people talk in new ways, fight in new ways and freeze in a moment to save their rights
 apana ap bana liya or metro ke electronic tikat kareedne kii ranneeti badal lee
 Changed the use of the phone's SIM card
 control ke in saamaanon ko nagarikon ne kabad main badal diya
 This process is stating that the state has not yet won the fight for citizenship
 honkong ke log soochna sansar ke aadhikarik network se khud hi alag ho gaye
 There is another story in Kashmir
 vahaan kai dinon ke liye soochna tantra band kar diya gaya
 The government has separated the population of more than one crore from the information world
 internet shatdown ho gaya
 Mobile phones shut down
 sarkaar ke adhikari press kaa kaam karne lage or press ke log sarkaar kaa kaam karne lag gaye
 Can you imagine the citizen and the citizen without information? 
 
 ? kya hoga, jab media, jiskaa kaam soochna jutanaa he, soochna ke tamaam network ke band hone kaa samarthan karne lage, or vah us citision ke khilaaf ho jaae, jo apane str par soochna laa rahaa he yaa laa rahi he yaa soochna kii maang kar rahaa he
 It is equally unfortunate that all of India's neighbors are at the bottom in freedom of the press
 pakistan, china, srilanka, bangladesh, myanmar or bharat
 They are also neighbors in the lower ranking
 pakistan main ek electronic media regulatory athurity he, jo apane news channelon ko nirdesh detaa he ki kashmir par kis tarah se propaganda karnaa he
 How to report ise vaise to sarkari bhashaa main salaah kehete hai, magar hota yah nirdesh hi he
 It is told how to keep the screen blank on August 15, so that they can celebrate Black Day in support of Kashmir
 jisaki samasya kaa pakistan bhi ek bada kaaran he
 On the other hand, when Anuradha Bhasin of 'kashmir Times' goes to the Supreme Court of India, the Press Council of India goes against her
 yah kehane ki kashmir ghati main media par lage bain kaa vah samarthan karata he
 In my opinion, the Press Council of India and the Electronic Media Regulatory Authority of Pakistan should have offices in the same building
 ganimat he ki editors gild of india ne kashmir main media par lagi roak kii ninda kii or press kanunsil of india kii bhi aalochana kii
 P

 baad main swatantraaa ke saath ho gaya
 Citizens of both countries should think that democracy is a serious business
 propaganda ke zariye kya vah ek duusare main bharosa paidaa kar paaenge
 
 
 The It is not Holi to hit the balloon from here, then hit the balloon from there
 vaise, bharat ke news channel parmaanu hamale ke samay bachane kii taiyaari kaa lacture de rahe hai
 They are told to hide in the basement at the time of nuclear attack
 aap hansen nahin
 They are doing their work very serially
 ab aap is sandarbh main aaj ke vishay ke topic ko frem kiijie
 This is the same media, which started to create 'citizen Journalism' to cut its expenditure
 iske zariye media ne apane risk ko outsource kar diya
 Citizen journalism within mainstream media and citizen journalism outside mainstream media are both different things
 lekin jab soshal media ke shuruaati daur main log sawaal karne lage, to yahi media soshal media ke khilaaf ho gaya
 Blogs and websites within the newsroom began to be closed
 aaj bhi kai saare newzaroom main patrakaron ko personal opinian likhane kii anumati nahin he
 It is a different matter that at the same time, the daily situation of the attack, war and devastation of the 24-year-old student Riverbend (real name not made public) through the Baghdad burning blog was coming in the form of a blog post and which was in 2005 In the book titled 'baghdad Burning: Girl Blog from Iraq', the world's leading media institutions believed that the work done by a girl through social media, our journalists too Can not do it
 yah citijan zarnalism he, jo menstream media ke baahar hua
 Today if a girl writes a blog like 'baghdad burning' in Kashmir, then the mainstream media will start calling her anti-national
 media lagaataar citision jarnalism ke spes ko anti-neshnal ke naam par di-legitimise karne laga he, kyonki uskaa interest ab jarnalism main nahin he
 In the name of journalism, the media state's comprador is the agent
 mere khyaal se citision zarnalism kii kalpana kaa beej isi vakt ke liye he, jab media yaa menstream jarnalism soochna ke khilaaf ho jaae
 He started seeing against every person who is struggling to get information
 menstream media nagarikon ko soochna se vanchit karne lage
 They started calling Asmati the traitor
 isiilie yah testing time he
 When the media turns against the citizen, then the citizen will have to become the media
 yah jaanate hue ki state control ke is daur main citision or citision jarnalism donon ke khatare bahut bade hai or safalata bahut dur nazar aati he
 For him, the doors of obtaining information from within the state are completely closed
 menstream media citision jarnalism main cost kating or profit kaa scope bananaa chahta he or iske liye uskaa sarkaar kaa PR hona zaruri he
 Citizen Journalism is struggling how it can stay out of the trap of government and advertising on public support
 bharat kaa menstream media padhe-likhe nagarikon ko din-raat post-ilitaret karne main laga he
 He has given up on trying to make the citizens surrounded by superstition a conscious and capable citizen
 andh-rashtrawaad or sampradayikta uske silebus kaa hissaa hai
 It is beginning to consider the state's neuter to be pure information
 agar aap is media ke zariye kisi demokrasi ko samajhane kaa prayaas karenge, to yah ek aise loktantr kii tasviir banaata he, jahaan sari soochnaaon kaa rang ek he
 This color corresponds to the color of power
 kai sau channel hai, magar saare channelon par ek hi andaaz main ek hi prakaar kii soochna he
 In a way, the questions are being framed so that perception can be spread in the name of information
 information main dharna hi soochna he
 (perception is the new information), in which every day citizens are intimidated, insecurity is created among them that your rights will be taken away on speaking
 is media ke liye vipaksh ek ganda shabd he
 When the opposition and dissent becomes abusive in the mainstream media, then the real crisis falls on the citizen
 durbhaagya se is kaam main news channelon kii awaz sabase karkash or oonchi he
 Anchor no longer speaks, shouts
 bharat main bahut kuch shandaar he, ek mahaan desh he, uski uplabdhiyaan aaj bhi duniya ke saamne nazir hai, lekin iske menstream or TV media kaa zyadatar hissaa gater ho gaya he
 The spirit of democracy is very good among the citizens of India, but the media of the news channels come to crush that spirit every night
 bharat main shaam to suraj doobane se hoti he, lekin raat kaa andhera news channelon par prasaarit khabaron se failata he
 Democracy is alive among the people in India
 har din sarkaar ke khilaaf zordaar pradarshan ho rahe hai, magar media ab in pradarshnon kii screening karne laga he
 Their news is no longer made
 uske liye pradarshan karnaa, ek phaltu kaam he
 There can be no democracy without Democracy
 in pradarshnon main shaamil lakhon log ab khud video banane lage hai
 The video, made from the phone, itself becomes a reporter and starts giving details of the scene, which is then run in a whatsapp group of people who came to the demonstration
 information kaa media unhen jis naagarikta kaa paath padhaa rahaa he, usamen naagarik kaa matlab yah nahin ki vah sarkaar ke khilaaf narebaazi kare
 So Citizen is making a video for the whatsapp group to protect what it means to be
 andolan karne vaale citision jarnalism karne lagate hai
 Start creating your video on youtube
 jab state or media ek hokar citision ko control karne lagen, tab kya koi citision jarnlist ke rup main act kar saktaa he
 
 
 The The eco-system also has to provide the same democracy to maintain citizenship and exercise its rights
 agar court, police or media hostyle ho jaaen, phir sosayadi kaa vah hissaa, jo state ban chukaa he, aapako exclud karne lage, to har tarah se nihattha hokar ek naagarik kis had tak lard saktaa he
 
 
 The The citizen is still fighting
 mujhe har din whotsape par 500 se 1,000 massej aate hai
 Sometimes this number is also high
 har duusare massej main log apni samasya ke saath patrakarita kaa matlab bhi likhte hai
 The mainstream news media may have forgotten journalism, but the public remembers what the definition of journalism should be
 jab bhi main apana whotsape kholta hum, yah dekhne ke liye ki mere offis ke group main kis tarah kii soochna ai he, main vahaan tak pahunch hi nahin paata
 i get entangled in seeing the information of thousands of people, that's why i call my whatsapp public newsroom
 deshbhar main mere number ko trol ne viral kiya ki mujhe gaali di jaae
 Abuses came, threats also
 aa rahi hai, lekin usee number par log bhi aae
 Regarding the news of himself and the region
 ye ve khabaren hai, jo news channelon kii paribhaasha ke hisaab se khatm ho chuki hai, magar unheen channelon ko dekhne vaale ye log jab khud pareshaani main padate hai, to unhen patrkaar kaa matlab pataa hota he
 Journalism has not disappeared from his mind
 jab ruling party ne mere sho kaa bahishkaar kiya tha, tab mere saare raste band ho gaye the
 At the time it was these people who filled my show with their problems
 jis menstream media ne citision jarnalism ke naam par zarnalism or satta ke khilaaf bolne vaale tak ko outsource kiya tha, jisase logon ke bich media kaa bhram bana rahe, citision ke is samooh ne mujhe menstream media main citision jarnlist bana diya
 This is the future of the media
 uske patrakaron ko citisine jarnlist bananaa he, taaki log citision ban saken
 At the same time, when the common people were lost from the news channels, and political debates began to be imposed on them through debit shows, a kind of narrator started to surround the people, at the same time people tried to break this circle
 Were also doing gaaliyon or dhamkiyon ke bich aise massej kii sankhya badhane lagi, jinamein log sarkaar se demand kar rahe the
 i started being trolled by people's problems
 kya aap nahin bolenge, kya aap sarkaar se darate hai
 
 
 The i started listening to them
 'prime Time' kaa mijaaz (nechar) badal gaya
 Thousands of messages started coming from the youth that Central Government and State Government do not complete the government job examination even in two to three years
 jin parikshaon ke riselt aa jate hai, unamem bhi apointment letters jari nahin karti hai
 If i calculate the number of youths who are appearing in all the exams, then the number of youngsters waiting for the result goes up to one crore
 'prime Time' kii 'job series' kaa asar hone laga or dekhte-dekhte kai parikshaon ke riselt nikle or apointment letters mila
 The state from which i come, there was no result of the 2014 examination till 2018
 bas meraa whotsap number public newzaroom main badal gaya
 Public became open source for me when my secret source started to move in the government and party system
 'prime Time' aksar logon ke bheje gaye massej ke aadhaar par banane laga he
 This was the reverse use of whatsapp
 ek taraf raajnneetik dal kaa iti cell lakhon kii sankhya main sampradayikta or xenophobia failaane vaale massej ja rahe the, to duusari taraf se asli khabaron ke massej mujh tak pahunch rahe the
 My newsroom has shifted from ndtv's newsroom to the public
 yahi bharat ke loktantr kii ummid hai, kyonki inhone na to sarkaar se ummid chodi he or na hi sarkaar se sawaal karne kaa rasta abhi band kiya he
 That's why they are looking for a window for themselves in the mainstream
 jab uniwarsity kii ranking ke jhuthe sapane dikhaae ja rahe the, tab collejon ke chaatr apane classroom or teacher kii sankhya mujhe bhejne lage
 How could i reach a college with 10-20 teachers per 10,000 students, if people do not come
 jarnalism iz nevar complit vidout citision and citicanship
 In the period when the media was defining Citizen according to the state, at the same time, Citizen started defining me according to his own
 demokrasi main ummiido ke cactus ke phool khilne lage
 i still remember the message from that girl from Chandigarh
 vah 'prime Time' dekh rahi thi or uske pita TV band kar rahe the
 He did not listen to his father and watched 'prime Time'
 vah bharat ke loktantr kii citision he
 As long as she is a girl, democracy will overcome its challenges
 un bahut se logon kaa zikr karnaa chahta hum, jinhone pehle trol kiya, gaaliyaan deen, magar baad main khud likhakar mujhase maafi maangi
 If i have got millions of abuses, then i have also got thousands of such messages
 maharashtra ke us ladke kaa massej yaad he, jo apni dukaan par TV par chal rahe nafrat vaale dibet se ghabara uthta he or akele kahin ja baithta he
 When he runs my show at home, his father and brothers stop saying that i am a traitor
 menstream media or iti cell ne mere khilaaf yah campagne chalaaya he
 You can understand that such campaigns have started screening homes
 yah main isliye bataa rahaa hum ki aaj citision jarnlist hone ke liye aapako state or state kii tarah bartaav karne vaale citision se bhi jujhna hoga
 The challenge is not just the state, there are also people like the state
 sampradayikta or andh-rashtrawaad se las bheed ke bich duusare naagarik bhi dar jate hai
 Their risk increases
 aapako apane mobile par yah massej dekhakar ghar se nikalnaa hota he ki massej bhejne vaala mujhe lynch kar dena chahta he
 Today's citizens are under double pressure
 uske saamne chunauti he ki vah is media se kaise lade
 Who does his business day and night in the name of the same
 ham is mode par hai, jahaan logon ko sarkaar tak pahunchane ke liye media ke bairicade se ladanaa hi hoga
 Otherwise, his voice will continue to roam in the inbox of whatsapp
 pehle logon ko naagarik bananaa hoga, phir state ko bataanaa hoga ki uskaa ek kaam yah bhi he ki vah hamaari naagarikta ke liye zaruri nirbhikta kaa maahaul banaae
 The government is also responsible for creating an atmosphere for questioning the state
 ek sarkaar kaa moolyankan aap tabhi kar sakate hai, jab uske daur main media swatantra ho
 After the information, now the next attack is happening on history, which gives us strength, inspiration
 us itihaas ko chhina ja rahaa he
 This was also the case at the time of independence
 bal gangadhar tilak, mahatma gandhi, dow ambedkar, ganesh shankar vidhyaarthee, pir mohammad moonis - anginat naam hai
 They were all citizen journalists
 1917 isvi main champaran satyagrah ke samay mahatma gandhi ne kuch dinon ke liye press ko aane se roak diya
 Wrote to them that you should stay away from Champaran Satyagraha
 gandhi khud kisaanon se unki baat sunne lage
 a public newsroom sat around Gandhi in Champaran
 vah apni shikaayatein pramaan ke saath unhen bataane lagi
 After that, the history of India's freedom struggle is in front of you
 main aise kisi daur yaa desh ko nahin jaanata, jo khabaron ke bagair dhadak saktaa he
 Authenticity of information is very important for any country to be alive
 suchanaaen sahi or pramanik nahin hongi, to nagarikon ke bich kaa bharosa kamazor hoga
 Therefore, the need for citizen journalism has increased once again
 vah citijan jarnalism, jo menstream media kii kaarobaari stritegi se alag he
 In this state of desperation, many people are filling this gap
 kamedi se lekar indiviual utyub sho ke zariye sitigin jarnalism ke essence ko zindaa kiye hue hai
 The effect of their strength is that not everything has been unilateral in India's democracy
 janata soochna ke kshetra main apane spes kii ladaai lard rahi he, bhale hi vah jeet nahin pai he
 Mahatma Gandhi made a talk about newspapers in the April 12, 1947 prayer meeting
 aaj ke divysive media ke liye unke pravachan kaam aa sakate hai
 Gandhi said about a big newspaper, in which it was published that no one listens to Gandhi in the Congress Working Committee
 gandhi ne kaha tha ki yadi akhbaar durust nahin rahenge, to phir hindustan kii azaadi kis kaam kii
 Today, newspapers are scared
 ve apni aalochana ko desh kii aalochana bana dete hai, jabaki main menstream media or khaskar news channelon kii aalochana apane mahaan desh ke hit ke liye hi kar rahaa hum
 Gandhi said - you should throw away these useless newspapers
 kuch khabar sunani ho, to ek duusare se puch len
 If you want to study, then choose newspapers carefully, which are running for the service of the Indians
 jo hindu or musalmaan ko milakar rahanaa sikhaate hon
 Newspapers and channels in India are doing journalism to incite hindu-muslims
 gandhi hote, to yahi kehete, jo unhone 12 april, 1947 ko kaha tha or jise main yahaan aaj doharaa rahaa hum
 Today, citizen journalists are needed on a large scale, but more important than that is citizen democracy
 DEMOCRACY NEED MORE CITIZEN JOURNALISTS, MORE THAN THAT, DEMOCRACY NEEDS CITIZEN DEMOCRATIC

 Virender Sehwag's absence to play against Australia in the first match of the tri-series ODI was surprising to many but Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni indicated that it was the team's decision to rest the opener
 dhoni ne kaha, ‘yah uski chot se nahin judaa tha
 Many other players also have minor injuries
 agar aap rohit ko khilaanaa chaahate hai to ek anbhavi khilaadi team main aa saktaa he or ek baahar ho saktaa he
 But Rohit will not get a chance now, so later without match practice he may have to play in difficult conditions
 yah lambii shrinkhalaa he
 Since the news of Sehwag being rested in the first match, news of differences in the team started spreading
 sutron ne haalanki jor dekar kaha ki yah faisla sarvasammati se liya gaya or yahaan tak ki sahvaag bhi yah faisla lene main shaamil tha
 Zaheer too did not play in the third match and Dhoni said that there was a problem in his knee
 dhoni ne kaha, ‘jaik ke ghutane main pareshaani he

 Lovers who run away from home and get married will not be able to go to the nearby Arya Samaj temple and get tied up
 21 aktubar ko rajasthan hycourt ne nirdesh diya ki mandir ko vidhivat vivaah karaane se pehle ladke or ladki ke mata-pita ko chah din kaa notice dena hoga
 Justice Dalip Singh and S
 es
 Kothari's bench gave this direction when it was found that the Arya Samaj temples in the state are conducting many marriages without following the rules and regulations
 peeth ke mutabik, samasyaayein isliye khadi ho rahi hai ki arya samaaj mandir apni sheersh sanstha arya pratinidhi sabha kii ore se vivaah karaane ke liye 1993 main banaae gaye niyamon kii andekhi kar rahe hai
 The courts in the state are littered with habeas corpus petitions and other disputes that question the validity of marriages in such temples
 peeth ne sabha se kaha he ki vah apni sambhddha sansthaaon par nigaraanee rakhe
 The bench said that it had recognized the role of Arya Samaj keeping in view the opposition of orthodox Hindus and ordered the police to protect the couple who sought protection
 nyaayadhishon ne yah bhi spasht kiya ki kisi vivaah main mata-pita kii ijaajat jaruri nahin he, lekin unhen suchit kiya janaa chahie kyonki arya samaaj mandiron main aise vivaah aam taur par bhagkar aane vaale jode karte hai
 The court directed the District Magistrate to prepare such notices which would be posted in the office of the Collector or Tehsildar and the police station
 adaalat ke nirdesh kaa makasad prakriya kaa paalan kiye bina hone vaale vivaahon ko rokna he
 But this will ultimately result in stopping those who run away with the lover to marry due to parental opposition, allowing parents to know the couple's address and whereabouts and place of marriage and thus There will also be a chance to create obstacles in their path

 bijepi 303 siton ke saath satta main ek baar phir vaapasi kii he
 Whereas the Congress which came under the leadership of Rahul Gandhi has had to face tremendous defeat
 congress 52 siton par simat gai he
 Accepting the defeat of the Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi offered to resign from the post of party president
 haalanki rahul ke istife par congress kii kaarysmiti faisla karegi, lekin zyaadaatar sambhaavna he ki ye peshkash mahaj aupchaarikta tak hi simit rah jaaegi
 Despite this, if Rahul Gandhi remains adamant on his resignation and accepts his resignation, then the question arises, who will be handed over the reins of the party? Congress President Rahul Gandhi in front of UPA Chairperson Sonia Gandhi Of
 iske baad sonia gandhi or party ke varisht netaaon ne samajhaayaa ki ye sab baaten party forum main rakhni chahie, jiske baad rahul gandhi ruke
 However Rahul Gandhi wanted to resign only during the press conference on Thursday
 iske baad sonia ne priyanka gandhi ko rahul ke ghar bheja
 After convincing Sonia and Priyanka, it was decided on Saturday that Rahul would offer his resignation at the party's CWC meeting
 yahi vajah rahi ki press conference main jab rahul gandhi yah poocha gaya ki kya vah istipha denge? is par rahul ne kaha, 'kaaryakarini kii hamaari ek baithak hogi
 You leave the issue of resignation between me and the executive
 'loksabhaa chunaav ke nateezon par manthan ke liye congress kaarysmiti kii baithak shanivaar ko hone ja rahi he
 It is believed that in this meeting, Rahul Gandhi can offer his resignation, taking responsibility for the defeat
 aise main mana ja rahaa he ki party kaa sheersh netritv pehle haar kii samiksha ke liye ek cameti gathit kar sakati he, jis prakaar 2014 main haar ke baad e ke antony ke netritv main gathit kii gai thi
 Even after this, if Rahul Gandhi remains adamant on his decision to resign, then in such a situation, the biggest question before the party will be: Who will be given the command of the party? In this list, the name of Priyanka Gandhi, who recently entered active politics, comes to the forefront
 aise main mahaj teen maheene main party kii kaman priyanka gandhi ko saunpi jaaegi to phir bijepi vanshavaad kii raajnneeti ko lekar congress par hamalavar ho sakati he
 The Congress may consider taking some other major step to keep itself apart from the shadow of Gandhi family dynasty
 rajeev gandhi kii hatya ke baad jis prakaar congress kii kaman pivi narsimha raav or uske baad seetaram kesari ko saunpi gai thi
 Even before this, the command of the Congress has been in the hands of a member outside the Gandhi family
 gauratlab he ki congress kii khoi siyaasi jameen ko talashne ke liye rahul gandhi ne edi chotii kaa jor lagaaya
 Party President Rahul Gandhi had 148 rallies in the 2 months 8 days election campaign in the Lok Sabha elections
 is dauraan unhone kareeb 1
 Made 25 km trips and bagged 52 seats across the country
 rahul gandhi ne sabase adhik 21 raily uttar pradesh main kii he or party mahaj ek seat jeet saki he

 kerala main 12 raily kii 15 siten milin
 Eight rallies in Bihar and one seat
 jharkhand main chaar reliyaan kiya or ek seat hi jeet sake
 In such a situation, taking responsibility for the defeat, Rahul Gandhi has offered to resign, but it is very unlikely that his resignation will be accepted
 unhone kaha,‘‘isse bada or kya bhram kya ho saktaa he, jabaki yah (rahul gandhi kaa) to mahaj do singh upanaamon ke bich kii gafalat thi

 The Samajwadi Party (SP) demanded the filing of a case against the ministers who were removed on the recommendation of the Lokayukta of Uttar Pradesh, saying that Chief Minister Mayawati is still gracious to many corrupt ministers including the state's Kabina ministers Nasimuddin Siddiqui and Swami Prasad Maurya and the SP Will complain to Lokayukta against these ministers
 cheharaa pahachaanen, jeeten inam
 To participate, CLP senior leader Shivpal Singh Yadav told reporters here that Chief Minister Mayawati has removed many of her ministers from the post based on the report of the Lokayukta, but many 'real corrupt' ministers still remain in positions
 
 unhone kaha ki aise mantriyon main cabinet mantri nasimuddin siddiki, swami prasad maury, lalji verma, ramvir upaadhyaay, ranchal rajbhar, fatehbahadur singh tathaa rakesh dhar treepathi shaamil hai
 All these ministers are still in their positions due to the grace of the Chief Minister and they pass on the money collected from the scam to the Chief Minister
 yadav ne ek sawaal par kaha ki unki party in mantriyon ke khilaaf lokayukta main shikaayat karegi
 He demanded that a case should be registered against the ministers who were removed from the cabinet on the basis of the report of the Lokayukta
 unhone kaha ki lakhanu jail main band rahe up mukhya chikitsadhikari doctor yogendra singh sachaan kii ‘hatya’ ke liye mukhyamantri khud doshi hai or unke pad par rahete is maamle kii nishpaksh jaanch nahin ho sakati
 Yadav claimed that Sachan was murdered in a farmhouse outside the jail
 sawaal yah he ki vah police abhiraksha ke bina jail se baahar kaise pahunche or phir hatya ke baad unhen karagaar main kaise laayaa gaya, kiske phone par is maamle ke doshi logon ko pakadaa gaya
 All these aspects should be investigated

 Actually, all these people are guilty in this case
 sapa netaa ne kaha ki chunki karagaar vibhaag mukhyamantri mayawati ke paas he, isaliye is puure ghatnakram ke liye vah khud jimmedaar hai
 Accusing the CBI investigation of the Sachan scandal as creating hurdles, Yadav said that the CBI investigation in the case cannot be conducted properly while he is in office, so Mayawati should resign from the post, otherwise the governor should sack him
 sapa main apradhi tatwon ke pravesh karne sambandhi prashn par yadav ne kaha ki unki party aise kisi bhi vyakti ko apane saath nahin rakhegi
 The place of such people is in jail
 unhone ek sawaal par kaha ki aapraadhik pravriti ke kahe jane vaale vidhayak guddu pandit par lage aarope agar sahi sabit hote hai to party unhen apane saath nahin rakhegi
 Several sensational revelations have come to light about the suicide of former Chief Minister of Arunachal Pradesh, Kalikho Pul
 kalikho pul ne 9 agast, 2016 ko itanagar main faansee lagane se ek din pehle 60 pej kaa ek suicide note likhaa tha
 In his last letter, Pul has allegedly leveled serious allegations against those sitting in constitutional positions, including the current Chief Minister Pema Khandu and Deputy Chief Minister Chovna Main and prominent leaders of the state
 arunachalmen kareeb chaar maheene ke liye mukhyamantri rahe pul ko baad supreme court ke aadesh ke baad pad se hatana padaa
 The court termed Tukey's dismissal of the previous government as unconstitutional
 ek sthaneey skool main chaukeedaar ke rup main kareer shuru karne vaale pul ne court ke is aadesh ke kareeb maheene bhar baad kathith rup se aatmahatya kar lee thi
 Police had taken this alleged note found near the body of the bridge and due to this, the things written in it remained a mystery
 haalanki ab samachar website 'da vir' ne is kathith note ke hawaale se kai daawey kiye hai
 In the suicide note, this serious accusation has been written by Pul, who wrote this letter, "I and my close friends have been contacted many times that if i give Rs 86 crore, the decision will be given in my favor
 main ek aam aadmi hum, mere paas na us tarah paisa he na hi main aisa karnaa chahta hum


’arunachal ke maujuuda mukhyamantri or haal hi bijepi main shaamil hue pema khandu ke bare main pul likhte hai, 'janata yah khud soche or vichaar kare ki mantri banane se pehle unke paas kya tha? or aaj kya he? unke paas paisa banane kii koi mashin yaa factory to nahin thi or na kuber kaa koi khajaana tha
 Then where did so much money come from? ”pul writes,“ This is the money of the people and these people who become ministers intimidate the people by showing the same amount of money and people run after it
 aaj janata ko iskaa jawaab maangana chahie or is maamle kii puri chaanbin honi chahie
 In his suicide note on the PDS scam in the state so far unresolved, Pul wrote, "for the first time in my 23 years of political life, i was paying for the photocopy of the PDS bill
" jabaki aisa kisi or rajya main nahin hota
 'he said,' Payment of more than Rs 600 crores was made under PDS
 in paison ko rajya ke deveopment fund se diya gaya tha
 Whereas this was the scheme of the Government of India and the Government of India did not give any money to the State Government after seeing the scam in it
 is peedies ghotaale ke mukhya doshi dorji khandu, pema khandu, nabam tuki or chowna main hai
 "when i became the Chief Minister," writes Pul, i investigated the case and tried to save the state government
 hamaari sarkaar ne food corporation of india (epasiai) ke khilaaf cese kiya, bharat sarkaar ke khilaaf cese kiya or supreme court main punarvichaar yachika bhi daayar kii thi
 He wrote, 'I am deeply saddened that the former ministers, former chief ministers and officials of the state together lost all the files, documents and necessary papers, due to which i could not save the state government in this case
 is cese main mukhya sachiv, sachiv, diarectaron or adhikariyon ko jail tak hone vaali thi
 The website has also put a copy of this last letter written by Pul, along with this news, although his allegations could not be confirmed
