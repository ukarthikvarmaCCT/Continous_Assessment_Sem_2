 Yes, but to deal with these Naxalites armed with high-tech weapons, if the government gives them special power, they will solve the problem in one go

 In this bloody war that lasted for hours, only 33 CRPF personnel fighting 300 Naxalites and villagers were weakened when the villagers stood up as slopes of Naxalites

 naksali hamale kii insaide storisukama main hua ye naksali hamalaa jitna khataranaak tha, isaki insaide story utani hi baichaiyn karne vaali he
 The Naxalites may have attacked the CRPF jawans with a sudden ambush, but the plot of this attack was quite deep and was going on for a long time
 hamale ko anjaam die jane kaa taur-tarika, taiyaari or hamale se pehle bhesh badal kar kii gai reki apane-aap main is baat ke subut hai
 This is the inside story of this year's biggest Naxalite attack in Sukma
 ji haa, chaar linon kii insaide story he, lekin is insaide story main naksaliyon kii gahari saazish ke aise-aise pechon-kham hai ki sun-sun kar dimaag gum jaataa he
 Villagers were involved in the conspiracy of the attack! Would you believe that the villagers of Sukma, who were crushed by the CRPF jawans in order to protect them from their innocence, removed the trigger of their guns, the same attack on the villagers of the CRPF Intrigue included
 jinhone upar se to apane chehre par maasoomiyat kaa labaadaa odh rakhaa tha
 But the Naxalites were supporting this conspiracy from inside

 Now this was a compulsion of these villagers or was it really wrong with their intentions, they can tell the same
 mahilaon or baccho ko banaaya dhalnaksaliyon ne qareeb 50 mahilaon or bacchon kaa dhaal ke taur par istemaal kiya
 The jawans were surrounded by three rocket launchers and attacked
 wo hamale ke dauraan hand-maid grenade se bhi hamale kar rahe the
 The attackers also included 50 female Naxalites
 javaanon se 25 insaas raifal or 6 eke 47 or ek rocket launture luute gaye
 By the time, the CRPF also put many Naxalites to death
 lekin chunki uske khud ke bahut se jawan maare ja chuke the, unhone naksaliyon kii laash baraamad karne kii bajaay apane javaanon ko aspataalon tak pahunchaana zyada zaruri samajha
 Apparently, there was definitely some shortage in this incident, which sacrificed precious lives
 desh main naksalwad ko khatm karne ke liye suzav die jate rahe hai
 Whereas the fear of loss of innocents and lack of political will due to the operation against the Naxalites has become the biggest obstacle in the way of mutilating the Naxalites
 narendra modi sarkaar ne desh ke alpsankhyakon ke kayakalp kii disha main kavayad shuru kar di he
 The government will link modern education by providing special training to the teachers of madrasas along with better education for the minorities
 saath hi madrason ko sahitya ke saath gyaan-vigyaan, computer, internet, i-larning or smart ajukeshan system se bhi joda jayega
 The Modi government's move is being described as a positive step for Muslim organizations and intellectual Muslims
 vahiin, islamic scollar ise hawa hawaii bayaan qaraar de rahe hai
 What says Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi: Union Minority Welfare Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi says that the government of Justice, Iman and Iqbal led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi has liberated the health of development from communalism and the disease of appeasement and has created an atmosphere of empowerment
 
 nakvi kaa kahana he ki alpsankhyak varg kii skool dropaut ladakiyon ko desh ke pratishthit shaikshanik sansthaanon se brij course kara kar unhen shiksha or rojgaar se joda jayega
 In order to encourage mainstream education in madrassas across the country, madrasa teachers will be imparted training from various educational institutions like Jamia Millia Islamia and Aligarh Muslim University etc
 taaki ve madrason main mukhyadhara kii shiksha hindi, angreji, ganit, vigyaan or computer aadi kaa gyaan de saken
 Welcoming this move of the Modi government, Jamiat ulema-e-hind general secretary Maulana Mahmood Madani said, "muslims should be linked to formal education
 desh ke laabh ke liye samaaj ke sabhi virgon ko samaan avasar pradaan kiya janaa chahie, visheshkar shiksha ke kshetra main
 We will always welcome such initiatives
 'madrason main bina dakhal die modern bananaa sakaaratmak kadam: kamaal farukidilli alpsankhyak ayog ke purv adhyaksh or muslimon ke liye kai shikshan santhaan chalaa rahe kamaal faruki kehete hai ki agar modi sarkaar madrason main bina kisi chhedchhad or badlaav kiye bagaiyr aadhunik shiksha kii vyavastha karti he to yah swaagat yogya kadam he
 He said that the way Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed his mps on May 26 after the Lok Sabha elections, talks about Muslims should be taken positively
 unhone kaha ki desh ke 20 karod muslimon ko peeche rakhkar desh ko tarakkee or vikaas kii raah par nahin laayaa ja saktaa he
 Farooqui said that in addition to training the teachers of madrasas, if the government opens the centers of IGNOU and NIOS (nation institute of open schooling) and connects them to modern education, then there is no objection
 iske alaava sarkaar ko ek order dekar yah bhi karnaa chahie ki madrase se nikalne vaale chaatro ko desh ke tamaam vishvavidhyalay main pravesh diya janaa chahie
 At present, admission is given only in Jamia Millia Islamia, Aligarh Muslim University, JNU and Maulana Azad Urdu University
 sarkaar kaa yah kadam hawa-hawaii: moulana hamid nomanivahin, aal india muslim majalis mushaavrat ke mahasachiv moulana hamid nomani modi sarkaar ke kadam ko hawa-hawaii bataate hue kaha ki madrason ko modern ajukeshan se jodne ke liye kisne roak rakhaa he
 You should make those madrassas in the country recognized by the government and take funds, but the Modi government wants to remain in the discussion by making an issue rather than doing something
 vah aresas kii vicharadhara se kaise alag jaakar musalamaanon kii shiksha vyavastha ko behatar banaaegi, yah ahm sawaal he
 Government schools do not have roofs
 bachche ped ke neeche baithkar pard rahe hai or madrason ko lekar baaten kii ja rahi hai
 'commendable step by Modi government to make madrasas and its teachers modern', while Kari Asrarul Haq Kasami of Madrasa running in Delhi's Fatehpuri mosque says that if the government connects with modern education in the madrassas without any intervention, then it is a better step
 aadhunik shiksha kii behad jaruri he or har madrason ko hitech kiye jane kii jarurat he
 It would be a welcome step if the Modi government had given a budget to train high-tech and modern education to teachers teaching in madrasas
 kaasmi kehete hai ki madrason kaa jo islamic makasad main usamen to vah kaamyaab he
 Islamic education gives a way to live life, but also has to be progressed to meet the needs of life
 is disha main madrase peeche hai
 In such a situation, if the Modi government takes steps to make madrasas and its teachers mardan, then there are commendable steps
 ye musalamaanon ke liye vakt kii jarurat he

 Seeing it as a violation of competition law, the regulator issued an order in January 2015 asking the Director General of its investigation unit to investigate the matter and submit a report
 tippaniyan In its 20-page order, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) said it believed that there was no reason to disagree with the Director General's report because whatever evidence there is between banks or the IBA regarding interest rates and service charges in 2011 Between 2016 and 2016, do not prove the nexus

 The old investors were paid from the money coming from the new investors

 It was the initial Punjabi company of Punjab, which closed in 2000 after police raids and tax scrutiny

 PACL was founded a decade later in 1996 as Gurwant Agrotech Limited

 Just before the Lok Sabha elections 2019, the politics of Madhya Pradesh has started revolving around reservation
 vidhansabha chunaav main haar se sabak lete hue bijepi ne savarna samudaay ke liye 10 fisadi kaa daanv chalaa he
 While the Congress is trying to bring the traditional vote bank of the BJP to its political equation
 dalit or adivaasiyon ko jodne ke baad mukhyamantri kamalnath ne obisi samudaay ko saadhane ke liye unke aarakshan ke daayre ko doguna karne kaa elaan kar diya he
 In Madhya Pradesh, the OBC community constitutes about 52% of the population, which is getting 14% reservation
 congress ne chunaav se ain pehle obisi kaa aarakshan 14 fisadi se badhaakar 27 fisadi karne kii baat kahi he
 Chief Minister Kamal Nath has earlier announced to give 27 percent reservation to the party's OBC conference in Bhopal
 iske baad buudhvaar ko sagar kii shaskeey baithak main kamalnath ne phir isi baat ko doharaaya
 In fact, the BJP has been in power in Madhya Pradesh for 15 years by helping Dalits, tribals and obcs
 lekin pichley saal aakhir main hue vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi ke paramparaagat votbank main congress sendhamari karne main kaamyaab rahi thi
 BJP was wiped out in Dalit and tribal dominated seats
 haalanki bijepi obisi bahul siton ko bachaane main kaaphi had tak kaamyaab rahi
 But just before the Lok Sabha elections, Kamal Nath has put the BJP on the back foot by taking the stakes of OBC reservation
 congress kaa tark he ki shivaraj singh chouhan obisi hote hue bhi obisi ke aarakshan ke daayre ko nahin badha sake hai
 Whereas in Madhya Pradesh, the OBC community has been demanding to increase the scope of their reservation for a long time
 kamalnath ne obisi aarakshan ke saath hi ye bhi ghoshnaa kii he ki rajya sarkaar saamaanya varg ke aarthik rup se kamjor logon ke liye sarkari naukariyon main 10 fisadi aarakshan kaa praavdhaan bhi lagu karegi
 Kamal Nath said that his government wants to give opportunities to all sections of the society to move forward
 darasal, pichley saal aakhir main hue paanch rajyon ke vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi kii haar kii mukhya vajah savarna samudaay kii naaraazgi ko mana gaya tha
 In such a situation, the Modi government at the center announced a 10 percent reservation to the poor general class before the Lok Sabha elections, and went on a master stroke of politics
 congress ne bijepi ke is daanv kaa kaat talash lee he
 While the BJP enacted a law to provide 10 reservations to the poor upper castes, the Congress made a move to give 27 percent reservation to the obcs through their OBC faces
 
 Whereas, President of Madhya Pradesh BJP Backward Classes Front, Bhagat Singh Kushwaha alleged that 'kamal Nath and the Congress government have lost their intentions, because the Kamal Nath government tried to hang the reservation of poor upper castes implemented by the central government but under pressure After the announcement of implementing the reservation of poor Savarnas

 This is not an occasion for the display of swords and sticks
 islam isaki ijazat nahin detaa
 Idris Ali said, 'people should follow the Shari'a while celebrating Muharram
 ek party dange karaane kii koshish kar rahi he
 Why should we give them such an opportunity? ”idaris Ali called the Chief Minister of the state, Mamata Banerjee, a symbol of communal harmony
 saansad ne yaad dilaayaa ki ‘pichley saal kaise mamata banerjee ne hindu samudaay se apil kii thi ki durga puja visarjan ko kuch der ke liye sthagit rakhen kyonki muharram bhi usee din pad rahaa tha
 This year the Muslim community should keep that peace and repeat that positivity
 ’saansad idris ali jaise hi party ke birbhum jila adhyaksh anuvrat mandal ne kaha
 'muharram should be celebrated in the same way as performed on the Kadurga immersion

 Mandal said, 'there is no use of swords or sticks in their religion
 ye bahut mukaddas (pavitra) dharm he, jo duniya ko acha sandesh detaa he
 Not a single maulvi has spoken about the use of lathis (during Muharram) here
 ’ mandal ne kaha, ‘islam kathin dharm he
 i think it is more difficult than Hinduism
 aaj maine unase (imaamon) jo bhi suna wo mujhe acha laga
 Maulana Shafiq Kasami, the Imam of the Nakhoda Mosque in Kolkata, called any display of aggression against Muharram against Islam
 unhone kaha, ‘iskaa (talwaar-laathiyon kaa pradarshan) islam se koi lenaa dena nahin he
 The Sharia is strongly opposed to this
 isaki jagah logon ko rojaa rakh kar, quran pard kar tyaag ke sandesh ko failaana chahie
 The Trinamool Congress supremo and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, on the occasion of Ramnavami this year, directed the police to take strict action against those illegally carrying out processions with weapons

 spain kii sarkaar ne kaha ki aane vaale 21 disambar ko sarkaar vahaan chunaav karaayegi, jiske baad catelonia kaa bhavishya tay hone kii ummid he
 Actually Catalonia has been demanding more money and financial independence from Spain for a long time
 iske peeche vajah yah he ki spain main sabase zyada kamai vaala hissaa yahi he jo har saal 12 arab dollar tex main detaa he
 25 percent of the country's exports are also from here, due to which it makes 20 percent of the country's GDP
 catelonia se spain ko jo kuch miltaa he, uskaa ek bada hissaa vah 120 lakh karod dollar ke karj kaa apana boj kam karne main lagaataa he
 However, in view of Catalonia's significant share in the country's economy, Spain has been making almost all its policies different and better than the rest of the states, due to which people living in other states of Spain are also angry
 tippaniyan In 2006, Spain gave Catalonia more power, autonomy by enacting an act
 lekin isse catelonia main panapati algaavvaadi bhavanaaen santusht nahin huin
 He believes that Spain is using the funds given by Catalonia to recover its other poor areas
 europe kii sabase mithi bhashaa bolne vaala spain 1977 ke taanaashaahee sankat ke baad se ab tak kii sabase bheeshan chunautiyon se guzar rahaa he, to catelonia ke algaavvaadiyon kii bhi raahen aasaan nahin hai
 First, Catalonia cannot be separated from Spain without the consent of Spain
 agar algaavvaadi netritv ne aisa kuch sochaa bhi to tamaam vyaavhaarik adchane ise sambhav nahin hone dengi
 Without Spain, it is difficult to get recognition from the European Union

 Spain's sweetest language-speaking Spain has been through one of the toughest challenges since the dictatorship crisis of 1977, so Catalonia's separatists are not easy on the road
 awwal to spain kii marji ke bagaiyr catelonia usase alag ho hi nahin saktaa
 Even if the separatist leadership thought of something like this, then all practical hurdles will not allow it to happen
 spain ke bagaiyr use europea sangh se bhi manyata milani mushkil he
 Overall, both sides need to understand the reality of today's world and adopt a slightly flexible approach and take a path in the middle that will allow Catalonia to feel independence while still being part of Spain
 bharat or pakistan match kii suraksha vyavastha kaa gauge lene ke liye pakistan se bharat aane vaali do sadasyit team ko wagha border par kai ghante atakana padaa
 The reason behind this was that one of the two members, Azam Khan, had a flaw in his visa
 hua kuch yun ki pakistan ne jab apni cricket team se pehle uski suraksha kii taiyaariyon ko dekhne ke liye pakistan se 2 sadasyeey suraksha dal bhejne kaa faisla kiya to un do main se ek osman anwar ko ravivaar hone ke baavjood bhartiya hai kamishan kii taraf se visa de diya gaya
 The other member Azam Khan was also asked to take a visa but Azam Khan did not take a visa saying that he already had a visa to India
 osman anwar ke saath khan ne jab wagha border ke zarie bharat main pravesh kiya to unka visa sadak maarg kaa nahin balki hawaii maarg kaa niklaa
 Delhi was registered as the city to be admitted in this visa
 matlab vah sadak maarg ye nahin daakhil ho sakate the
 Therefore, they were stopped at Wagah immigration
 bharat or pakistan donon desh ek duusare ke nagarikon ko visa shahar ke hisaab se dete hai
 That is, the city that has a visa can go there itself
 itnaa hi nahin visa form par ye bhi ullekh karnaa padataa he ki ve kis maarg se ek se duusare desh main pravesh karenge
 The comments aazam khan ke maamle kii jaankaree jab videsh mantralay ko di gai wo turant harqat main aa gaya
 Because the matter was related to the security of the cricket match, the ministry took it as a special case
 khan ke visa main zaruri tabdili kii pairvi karte hue videsh mantralay ne grih mantralay likh diya
 The Ministry of Home Affairs makes the final decision regarding visas for Pakistani citizens
 grih mantralay ne bhi khan ke visa main tabdili par apni muhar laga di
 Only then both Usman and Khan left for Dharamshala from Wagah
 is bich pakistan ke up ucchayukta ubaidur rahamaan nizamani dharmashala pahunch chuke the
 Something happened that when Pakistan decided to send a 2-member security team from Pakistan to look into their security preparations before their cricket team, one of those two, Usman Anwar, despite being on Sunday, got visa from Indian High Commission given away
 duusare sadsy aazam khan ko bhi visa lene ko kaha gaya lekin aazam khan ne ye kehete hue visa nahin liya ki unke paas pehle se bharat kaa visa he
 When Khan along with Usman Anwar entered India via the Wagah border, his visa turned out to be not a road but air route
 is visa main daakhil hone vaale shahar ke taur par dilli darj tha
 That means they could not enter that road
 isliye unako wagha imigration par roak liya gaya
 Both India and Pakistan give visas to each other's citizens according to the city
 yani jis shahar kaa visa hoga vahiin ja sakate hai
 Not only this, it has to be mentioned on the visa form that through which route they will enter from one country to another
 tippaniyan When information about Azam Khan's case was given to the Ministry of External Affairs, he immediately came into action
 kyonki maamla cricket match kii suraksha gauge se judaa tha isliye mantrayal ne ise special cese ke taur par liya
 The Ministry of External Affairs wrote to the Ministry of Home Affairs, advocating for necessary changes in Khan's visa
 pakistani nagarikon ke visa se sambandhit antim faisle grih mantralay hi karata he
 The Ministry of Home Affairs also approved a change in Khan's visa
 iske baad hi osman or khan donon wagha se dharmashala ke liye ravaanaa ho sake
 Meanwhile, Pakistan Deputy High Commissioner Ubaidur Rahman had reached Nizamani Dharamshala

 " Signs of reduction in stubble burning incidents may improve air, relief from pollution: Good news is coming in terms of pollution in Delhi and surrounding areas
 punjab, haryana or pashchimi uttar pradesh main dhan kii fasal ke bekaar hisse yani paraali ko jalaane ke maamalon main kami ai he
 Last week, pollution levels in Delhi reached 15 times the WHO standard
 india today kii data intelligence unit (DIU) ne NASA ke form project ke tahat modis or viras satellite plateform se mili aankade kaa vishleshan karne ke baad paaya ki 10 november ke baad uttar bharat main paraali jalaane kii ghatnaon main kareeb 88 fisadi kii kami ai he
 However, there is no information on whether the declining trend will continue
 pichhali baar bhi teen-chaar dinon tak sankhya main kami ai lekin dobaaraa kisaanon ne paraali jalaana shuru kar diya
 However, the time of sowing wheat is also running out, so there is a high possibility of reduction in the occurrence of straw
 satellite ne punjab, haryana sahit uttar bharat ke kai ilaakon main thermal imageri ke jariye aag kii hajaaron ghatnaon ke alert jari kiye
 The city of Delhi, already considered to be among the most polluted cities in the world, became more toxic
 supreme court ke roak ke baavjood paraali kii ghatnaayen khaastaur par punjab or haryana main ghatit huin
 When the wind speed and direction turned towards Delhi, then in Delhi, already facing pollution, the situation started getting worse
 pichley hafte ke shuruaati teen dinon main punjab, haryana, upi sahit uttar bharat ke anya rajyon main paraali jalaane ke saat hajaar se zyada maamle saamne aae
 Cold and low speed winds coming from the northwest with dangerous polluted particles especially PM2
 5 sanghanit hokar dilli kii hawa main ghul gaye
 Inversion means that the stall for cold weather as well as the stall for smog or poisonous smoke in the air makes it toxic
 isliye pradooshan kaa str alag-alag shaharon yaa ilaakon main alag-alag hota he
 Due to the geographical structure of Delhi, millions of trains and thermal stations, the air remains normal only one or two days in a year
 aise main paraali se aane vaala dhuaan yahaan kii hawa main or jehar ghol detaa he
 For example DIU has the most dangerous pollution particle PM2
 5 jise logon ke naak ke bal or mask roak nahin pate unka dilli main har ghante ausat level check kiya
 We found that on November 15 it reached the highest of 600
 dablyuechao ke standard ke hisaab se ise 25 hona chahie tha
 After calculating the 24-hour level of the whole week, found that PM2 on average at all times during the previous week
 5 dablyuechao ke standard se 15 guna adhik tha
 Although the impact of the lack of incidents of stubble has not been much on Delhi's air, but since Saturday, there have been signs of fall in pollution levels
 uttar bharat ke shaharon main hawa kii gunvattta kaa suchakank yani AQI main raahat he
 PM2 in Gurugram at seven o'clock on Sunday (17 November)
 5 AQI 107 tha, vahiin dilli kaa 259 (subah 6 baje), faridabad 266, noida 218, gajiabad 226, lakhanu 254, muradabad 209, kanpur 327, varanasi 304, patna 344, kolkata 236 darj kiya gaya
 All these figures are 6 on Sunday morning
 jahrili hawa kii sabase zyada maar uttar bharat ke shaharon main he
 Where indiscriminate construction goes on throughout the year with dust and smoke
 dilli main badi sankhya main gaadiyaan, thermal power plants or thand ke saath paraali jalaane kii ghatana ise zyada khatarnaak bana detii he
 Therefore, if any of these are somehow less then Delhi feels a little relief
 paraali jalaane ke maamle kam hone se dilli ko fori raahat bhale hi mili lekin pradooshan se puri tarah mukt hone ke philhal asaar nahin hai
 a court in Pilibhit district in Uttar Pradesh has issued a non-bailable warrant against Union Minister Kalraj Mishra
 unke khilaaf varsh 2009 main hue loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan aachaar samhita ke ulanghan kaa aarope he
 Assistant Prosecuting Officer (APO) Amarnath Tiwari said on Thursday that when BJP candidate Varun Gandhi surrendered after the surrender of BJP candidate Varun Gandhi on March 28, in the case of raging speech during the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, Kalraj Mishra also with his heavy convoy Were present in the court premises
 tiwari ne bataaya ki mishra jab 8 oktober ko bhi hajir nahin hue tab court ne ek baar phir unke khilaaf gairajamaanti warrant jari kar diya or agali sunwaayee ke liye 22 november kii tithi tay kar di
 Tiwari said that a case was filed against Kalraj Mishra in that case for violation of Code of Conduct and Section 144
 unhone bataaya ki kai baar saman bheje jane ke baavjood mishra court main upasthit nahin hue to 31 agast ko mukhya nyaayik magistrate kii court ne unke khilaaf gairajamaanti warrant jari karke 8 oktober ko sunwaayee kii tithi tay kii thi
 This time, the effect of normal monsoon and normal distribution is on the country
 puure desh main kharif fasalon kii buvaai kaa rakabaa pichley saal ke mukaable takreeban 36
 66 lakh hectare has been more
 krishi mantralay ke taaja aankadon ke mutabik 1 sitambar tak kharif kaa kul buvaai kshetra 1033
 Has reached 99 lakh hectares, compared to 997 at this time last year
 11 lakh hectare tha
 The biggest reason behind the sowing of kharif crop is believed to be the beginning of rains at the right time and equal distribution of rains
 monsoon sijan kii shuruyaat main yani june ke duusare hafte se hi desh main barish ne jor pakad liya or ye sthiti abhi tak bani hui he
 Because of this, farmers sowed extensively sowing of kharif crops
 kharif sijan kii mukhya fasal dhan he or isaki monsoon par nirbharta kaaphi had tak he
 Due to good rains this time, the area under sowing of paddy in the country was 364 last year
 43 lakh hectare ke mukaable 372
 Has been 95 lakh hectares
 yani dhan utpaadak rajyon main rakabe main badhotaree he
 With the increase in production of paddy due to better sowing of paddy, and with the increase in its production, this time the cost of farmers is likely to remain low
 lekin sawaal ye he ki kya kisaanon ko is baar behatar keemten mil paaengi yaa nahin
 Kharif sowing of coarse cereals also increased by about 10 lakh hectares this time to 184 against last year
 13 lakh hectare darj kii gai he
 Sowing area of oilseed crops like mustard and groundnut also increased by 1 lakh hectare during the kharif season as compared to last year 179
 60 lakh hectare ho gaya he
 On the other hand, in the case of sugarcane, the area under sowing has been reduced by 5 lakh hectares from the previous year to 45
 77 lakh hectare rahaa he
 Talk about pulses, this year has seen a tremendous increase in its sowing area
 pichley saal 1 sitambar tak daalon kii buvaai 106
 92 lakh hectares of area
 lekin kharif sijan main is baar dalhan fasalon kaa buvaai rakabaa 142
 Has been 02 lakh hectares
 iskaa sidhaa sa matlab ye hua ki is samay daalon kii badi hui keemton or achche monsoon kaa asar daal kii buvaai par bhi dikh rahaa he
 Due to vigorous sowing, the prices of pulses have started softening
 aisa anumaan he ki aane vaale maheenon main daal kii keemton main or giravat aegi

 dhaka main 2011 vishwa cap kaa vah pehla match tha or bharat main har koi badla lene kii baat kar rahaa tha
 Bangladesh defeated India in the first match of the 2007 World Cup in the Caribbean and what happened then became one of the most painful chapters in the history of Indian cricket
 us haar kaa badla lekar us shreshthata ko behaal karnaa tha
 Virender Sehwag hit the first ball with a four and said that this time there will be no mistake
 unke visphotak 170 ran or yuva viraat kohli ke 101 ranon ne bharat ko aasaan jeet hasil karne main madad kii
 Sehwag, Tendulkar, Dhoni and Yuvraj breathed a sigh of relief after the completion of that 'revenge campaign' and for Kohli, the match was just an occasion to celebrate
 kohli ko 2007 ke dard kaa anubhav nahin tha or 2011 unke liye ek saahasik abhiyaan tha
 Although India won the Under-19 World Cup under Kohli's captaincy, he was a child in that team of 2011 and was not burdened with failure like other senior players
 isliye ve us jeet kii raahat or anand kaa swaad nahin samaj sakate the jo dardanaak haar ke baad mili thi
 Perhaps that is why they would not have experienced the joy of the World Cup victory that others had
 beshak ve bhi jeet se beintiha khush the lekin tendulkar kii tarah bhavuk haragij nahin ho sakate the jinaki ankhen jeet ke baad chhalak ai thim
 Tendulkar waited a long 22 years for this prestigious trophy
 kohli mahaj teen saal main vishwa cap kii trophy uthaane vaali team ke saajheedaar ban gaye the
 In 2015, the map had changed
 kohli ab team kii ballebaaji ke mukhya aadhaar ban chuke the or unase apeksha kii jaati thi ki ve is team ko vishwacap jitaane main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaayenge
 After Tendulkar's retirement, he was like a talisman for India and the disciple replaced the Guru
 ve nihsandeh simit overon ke khel main sarvshereshth khilaadi hai
 At the peak of his career as a batsman
 ve nae-nae record banaate ja rahe hai or jald hi tendulkar ke 49 ekadivasiy shatakon ke record ko bhi peeche chhod denge
 Kohli is aware of the expectations of the World Cup 2019
 unhen pataa he ki isamen kitna kuch daanv par laga he
 Excerpts from his candid conversation with him: Is the 2019 World Cup the most important tournament you have played? Nothing can be bigger than the World Cup
 jab main peeche mudakar dekhtaa hum, to mujhe kahana padataa he ki 2011 main main kam umr kaa tha or mujh par faisle lene kaa dabaav nahin tha
 In the way our team was, all i had to do was play well
 2015 kaa toornament is myne main alag tha ki main pehle se adhik khel main shaamil tha lekin phir bhi, mujhe sabhi meeting or nirnay lene vaale satron kaa hissaa nahin bananaa padaa
 Now it's a little different as a captain
 mujhe pataa he ki nirnay kii jimmedaari meri hogi or yah pakkaa karnaa meri jimmedaari he ki ham england main sahi disha main badhen
 This is what makes this World Cup the biggest of all the tournaments in which i have played so far
 or ek ballebaaj ke rup main? aap shaayad apni sarvshereshth ballebaaji kar rahe hai
 You have scored seven or eight centuries every year in the last few years and are now knocking on the doors of Sachin Tendulkar's record of 49 ODI centuries
 kya yah aapako is vishwa cap main nayaa vishwaas detaa he?pichley kuchhek hafton main yah sawaal mujhase kai baar poocha gaya he
 To be honest, i do not know that it is my best batting according to my ability
 haa, maine acha pradarshan kiya he or main acchhee tarah se jaanata hum ki kisi na kisi mode par giravat bhi aegi
 But i am not going to pay attention to that
 main vartmaan main jeeta rahaa hum or apni team ke liye match jeetne kii koshish kar rahaa hum
 This is the only thing that means anything
 is prakriya main agar kuch record tuutate hai, to thik he
 The only thing that matters is India's victory and i try my best to contribute to it
 team kaa elaan kar diya gaya he or aapke paas 15 jujharuon kii toli he
 Are you completely satisfied with this? Is this the best and complete team we could have chosen? Of course
 hamane is team main sabhi pakshon kaa dhyaan rakhaa he
 We have good batsmen and players with three-pronged abilities like Vijay Shankar and Hardik Pandya
 hamaare paas kuldeep (yadav), (yujavendra) chahal or (rabindra) jadeja ke saath bahut acha spin akraman he or hamaare paas ek tej aakraamak gendbaaj bhi hai
 For a long time we tried many players at number 4 but with Vijay Shankar coming, that place is complete
 ve ek umdaa ballebaaj, bahut achche fielder hai or ek pari ke bich main 4-5 over kii gendbaaji bhi kar sakate hai
 We have always wanted a three-dimensional player and we used to see every opposition team that has such players with surprise
 ab hamaare paas aise khilaadi hai or mujhe kahana hoga ki team main vijay ko shaamil kiye jane se main khush hum
 Although it has not been decided yet who will bat at which place but the strength of Team India has increased with the arrival of Vijay
 dhoni ke bare main aapane hameshaa garmjoshi se baat kii he
 When his performance was on a slight slope, you asked people to wait with restraint
 
 
 ham hameshaa se jaanate rahe hai ki mahendra singh dhoni is khel main apane saath kya lekar aae hai
 When people fell on their hands, i felt that injustice was being done to them
 us samay hamane jo kaha uski ek thos vajah thi
 We talked in detail on this aspect that if they are not here then what are the things we will lose
 ekadivasiy match main 35 se 50 overon ke bich ye maahi bhai hi hai jo stump ke peeche se fielding kaa samaayojan karte hai, kyonki vahi aisa karne ke liye sabase acchhee pojishan main khadey hote hai
 i have to field towards the edge in the field because i can stay in the same field and contribute the most in the team
 hamaare bich purna vishwaas or sammaan kaa rishta he
 i am fortunate to have met someone like him who has been with me throughout my journey and in the context of sports, he knows almost everything about me
 lambey samay baad yah vishwa cap sabase pratispardhaa purna hone ja rahaa he, jisamen bhaag le rahi har team ko baaki sabhi tiimon se khelnaa he
 India's opening four matches against South Africa (june 5), Australia (june 9), New Zealand (june 13) and Pakistan on June 16 will be tough
 main in muqablon ko ek avasar ke rup main dekhtaa hum
 These four tough teams will start with a tough fight in each of these games
 agar ham unhen haraate hai or usase ek statement dete hai to hamaare abhiyaan ko majbootee milegi
 You need to be aggressive, be prepared to take risks in the World Cup
 shuruyaat main kuch aasaan match khilne ke bajaae, mujhe badi tiimon ke saath khilne kii khushi he kyonki isse hamaare aage kaa abhiyaan sthapit hoga
 Our focus is only on playing better cricket
 kya aapane 15 july ko vishwa cap kii trophy ke saath lords kii balcony par khadey hone kaa sapana dekha he?nahin, bilkul nahin
 As i said, i want to be in the present and take one step at a time
 hamaare paas pehle nau game hai, phir semifinal or uske baad hi final hoga
 We will proceed by keeping in mind one match at a time

 com / s9mpvgwoih— UTV Motion Pictures (@utvfilms)august 13, 2015dekhen film 'katti batti' kaa gaanaa sarphira: When Sanskrit studies started at Peking University in China in 1960, the tradition stalled for hundreds of years was revived here
 saatvin sadi main hwain sang ke bharat daure ke baad chini vidwaanon ke liye sanskrit padhuya karmkand kii tarah ban gaya tha
 It was because of Sanskrit that he was able to translate Buddhist texts
 buddha dharm ne to china main jaden jamaa leen lekin sanskrit kii padhai dhire-dhire khatm hoti gai
 Huyang Baoseng was just 18 years old when the modern-day Chinese great Indian Ji Jianlin, who had knowledge of Sanskrit and Pali in the 1940s, undertook a new course at Peking University
 unhone vaidic sahitya par shodh niabandh taiyaar kiya he
 In a five-decade academic career, Huyang translated hundreds of texts from the Bhagavad Gita, the Upanishads to the Buddhist literature Lalitvistar Sutra and Vajrachedika or the Diamond Sutra
 aaj sanskrit or pali bhashaa main unka jod duniya main koi nahin he
 In view of Huyang's dedication to the language, the Deemed University National Sanskrit Sansthan, under the Ministry of Human Resources, conferred him with the President's Citation on 15 August 2011
 us saal yah sammaan paane vaale huyang ekmaatr antarrashtriya vyakti the
 With this honor five lakh rupees
 kaa puraskaar bhi diya jaataa he
 But 72-year-old Huyang, suffering from eye disease, could not come to India to seek the honor from President Pratibha Patil
 huyang or china ke sabase pratishthit academik santhaan chinis academy of soshal sciensej (sieeses) ke unke saathiyon ke liye yah sammaan lambey samay se dey tha
 But the award got stuck in red tape
 is vajah se donon deshon kaa shaikshanik aadan-pradaan baadhit ho rahaa he
 Huayang received a citation, but the institute said that the prize money can only be given if a Chinese bank certifies his signature on the form
 lekin chini bainkon kaa tark he ki china kaa kanoon unhen kisi bhi aise form ko pramanit karne kaa adhikaar nahin detaa jo china sarkaar se jari nahin hua ho
 Banks notorious for red tape have clearly stated that they can give a standard certificate of deposit account but cannot give proof of Huayang's survival
 agast 2013 main email ke jariye santhaan ko huyang ke chini bank main khate kaa certificate bheja gaya
 In April this year, he received no response from the institute or the Ministry of Human Resources, he wrote to the Indian Embassy in Beijing
 duutavas ne jawaab main kaha ki uske paas huyang ke puraskaar kaa koi record nahin he isliye uski prati bhej den
 a copy was emailed to the embassy in June this year
 lekin ab tak koi jawaab nahin mila
 Shukla Mukherjee, project in-charge at the institute that handles the case, says Binod Singh, an assistant professor at Peking University and a student of Huyang, carried a citation and a shawl last year
 haalanki yah saaf nahin he ki unhen puraskaar kii raashi kyon nahin di gai
 Sources, however, confirm that Chinese banks' failure to sign the form correctly became a hindrance
 sieeses ke apane daftar main huyang ne india today se kaha ki ve sammaan paakar ‘‘kaaphi gauravanvit’’ mahasoos karte hai
 They state that they have not received the prize money
 sanskrit sahitya or apane anuwaad kii darjanon kitabon ke bich baithe huyang sanskrit ko china main pratishtha dilaane kii baat karte hai
 It took him nearly a decade to translate six volumes of the Mahabharata, printed in 2005, and has received awards for it from the Chinese government
 yah anuwaad hathohath bik gaya or ab aglaa sanskaran laayaa ja rahaa he
 "sanskrit is the formula for understanding India's culture, philosophy, ideas and texts," says Huyang
 mere kai chaatr buddha dharm ke bare main or jaananaa chaahate hai or uske liye sanskrit padhuya chaahate hai
 Binod Singh says that Huayang's case is not the only one
 ‘‘isamen sabase badi aadchan afasarshahi he
 "they say that Chinese students eager to study Sanskrit have to go through the complicated application process in India
" isliye inamen se kai sanskrit seekhney europe chale jate hai

 The old alliance of Congress and National Conference has been broken in Jammu and Kashmir
 congress aagaamee vidhansabha chunaav main 87 siton par akele hi chunaav ladegi
 Congress General Secretary Ghulam Bani Azad made a formal announcement of the break-up of the alliance with the National Conference at a press conference
 unhone yah bhi saaf kiya ki party chunaav main sabhi siton par akele hi utregi
 State Chief Minister Omar Abdullah took to Twitter to explain why he did not announce the break up of the alliance
 unhone likhaa, 'maine unase kaha ki iskaa elaan nahin karuunga, kyonki main avasarwaadi nahin dikhnaa chahta

 Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi has filed a reply to a notice sent by a Lok Sabha committee on his alleged 'dual citizenship' issue
 apane jawaab main rahul ne ek aisi shikaayat kaa sangyaan lene ke samiti ke faisle par sawaal uthaae jo 'sahi nahin thi
 Targeting Subramanian Swamy, he also challenged BJP leader Subramanian Swamy to make his British passport number and other related documents public
 bijepi ke varisht netaa laal krishna adwani kii adhyakshata vaali aachaar samiti kii ore se bheje gaye notice ke jawaab main rahul ne yah bhi kaha ki shikayatakarta ne is mudde par 'saraasar gumraah' kiya he
 In his reply to the Committee's Secretariat on March 23, Rahul asked for evidence, the Congress vice-president said, "I am shocked that the Ethics Committee took cognizance of a complaint which is not true
" yah mujhe badnaam karne kii koshish he
 i have neither sought nor taken British citizenship
 meri pahchaan ek bhartiya kii he
 According to sources closely associated with the case, Rahul has demanded that the complainants present evidence to prove their allegation and file an affidavit in support of their arguments
 'swami ne saaf taur par kiya gumraah'rahul ne kaha, 'apni daleel ke samarthan main vah jis dastavej par bharosa kar rahe hai usamen kahin nahin likhaa he ki maine khud ko kabhi british naagarik ghoshit kiya he
 He said that it was clear that the complainant had 'grossly misled'
 congress upaadhyaksh ne kaha ki naagarikta ek tathy hoti he or yadi unhone kabhi british naagarikta maangi yaa hasil kii to vah british grih karyaalay ke aadhikarik dastavejon kaa hissaa hogi
 He said, 'the fact could have been ascertained from the source before lodging the complaint
 ' sutron ne notice par rahul kii ore se daakhil kiye gaye jawaab ke hawaale se bataaya, 'main shri swami se anurodh karata hum ki vah rahul gandhi ke kathith british passport number or sambandhit dastavejon ko saarvajanik kar unke british naagarik hone ke saboot saamne laaen
 Charges on Rahul Gandhi: The Ethics Committee headed by Advani issued a notice to Rahul in the second week of March seeking his reply on the allegation that the Congress vice-president had asked himself to take up the position of director in a UK company Was declared a British citizen
 aachaar samiti ko bheji gai shikayatisase pehle janvari ke pehle hafte main loksabhaa adhyaksh sumitra mahajan ne bijepi saansad mahesh giri dwaara kii gai shikaayat ko aachaar samiti ke paas bhej diya tha

 The third octave poet Kedarnath Singh is no more
 aath kavita sangrah or teen aalochana pustakon kii thati vah hindi sahitya ke liye chhod gaye hai
 His collections are cooking ground, cranes and talastas and bicycles have been quite popular in the famine
 sahitya academy puraskaar, vyas sammaan or gyanpith sahit kai puraskaar praapt kedaar ji kaa aakhri saakshaatkaar india today sahitya varshiki 2017 main prakashit hui thi
 This conversation was done by art-culture journalist Ajit Rai
 ek safar main ajit raay kedarnath singh ke saath the or donon kii baatcheet main maano vishwa kavita kaa puraa itihaas khul gaya tha
 In that neem dark night, the two had reached each other in the geography of the poem
 usee baatcheet main kedarnath singh ne yaad kiya tha, ki kaise jab nikaragua ke padri or communist kavi arnesto kardenaal ne hollywood kii dreamgirl merlin munro kii aatmahatya par kavita likhi to tahalaka much gaya,''he ishwar,tum to jaanate ho,vah kisase baat karnaa chaahati thi
 "(then softly says)" She wanted to talk to the American president
 vah prem main thi
 How sad it is for a woman to commit suicide in love! ") Ajit Rai now turned the conversation on love
 kedarnath singh smriti ke gahare anant se guzarate hue phir kardenaal ko yaad karne lage,''jab tum nahin hotin neuyork main,to koi nahin hota neuyork main
 When you are in New York, nobody is in New York
 "aise mahaan kavi ko communist party ne nikaal diya kyonki unhone padri kaa farz adaa karte hue pope ke charan chume the
 The conversation then shifts to the dialogue of the great Russian poets Mykowski and Stalin
 kedarnath singh ne puraa kissa bataaya tha,moscow ke ek chote-se anjaan kaife main chaar doston ke bich ek yuva kavi ne stallin ke kilaaf ek kavita padhi
 He was a protégé of Mykowski
 duusare din maaychovsky ke ghar stallin kaa phone aa gaya
 Stalin named the young poet and asked what kind of poet he is
 maaychovsky ne darate hue ghabaraakar bol diya ki vah saadhaaran kavi he
 Stalin hung up the phone saying, "you don't want to save your friend
" "maaychovsky kii patni ne unhen koob danta
 After that night nothing of that young poet was revealed
 yani ki stallin jaisaa taanashaah bhi kisi kavi ko maravane se pehle yah jaananaa chahta tha ki uskaa kya str he
 It was possible that Mykowski would have saved his life by saying that he was an important poet
 "((kedarnath singh ke saath ajit raay kii puri baatcheet india today sahitya varshiki main unke antim saakshaatkaar ke rup main hamaari mahatvapurn viraasat he

 ))*** The Opposition is meeting on Thursday to field its candidate in front of Ramnath Kovind for the presidency, but even before the meeting, many opposition parties are believing that the Opposition has again missed planning its strategy to counter the BJP
 baithak ke pehle yah charchaa purajor tareeke se chal rahi he ki vipaksh purvaloksabhaa spikar mira kumarako apana ummidavaar bana saktaa he
 Meera Kumar is also a Dalit like Ramnath Kovind, a tall leader and the daughter of Jagjivan Ram
 saath hi loksabhaa spikar rah chuki hai
 Many opposition parties feel that the pressure on NDA would have increased if Congress President Sonia Gandhi had spoken to the other opposition parties and announced Meera Kumar as a candidate before the NDA
 mira kumaar ke naam par sahamat nahin huin mamtasutron ke mutabik sonia gandhi se kuch netaaon ne is bare main charchaa kii thi
 Sonia Gandhi was also in favor of making Meira Kumar a candidate
 magar unka kahana tha ki left or mamata banerjee gopal krishna gandhi ko vipaksh kaa ummidavaar banane ke paksh main hai
 Therefore, a decision could not be made on Meera Kumar's name
 iske baad tay kiya gaya ki pehle endie ko hi apana ummidavaar ghoshit karne diya jaae
 Now many opposition parties feel that even though Meira Kumar can be pitted against Dalit against the Kiramnath Kovind, the NDA has won the bet by giving the message of Dalit politics
 sankhya bal ke hisaab se endie ke ummidavaar kaa jeetna to pehle hi se tay he, magar vipaksh sankethik taur par bhi endie se haar gaya
 Now the situation is that even before the Opposition meeting, the parties that support him, seem to agree on the name of Ramnath Kovind
 bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ramnath ko samarthan dekar vipaksh ko bada jhatka de chuke hai
 Nitish's support for vote bank! In fact, all political parties are thinking of their loss and damage in the matter of taking a stand on Ramnath Kovind
 nitish kumaar ramnath kovindke paale main isliye aae kyonki vah mahadalit hai, jisaki raajnneeti nitish kumaar karte rahe hai
 Apart from this, there was a reason for Kovind to be the governor of Bihar
 yahi nahin lalu yadav kii rashtriya janata dal se bhi nitish kumaar kii tanatani lagaataar chal hi rahi he
 In such a situation, Nitish Kumar is increasing the pressure on Lalu Yadav by going close to BJP on the pretext of Ramnath Kovind
 maaya-akhilesh kaa asamanjasauttar pradesh kii partiyon kaa asamanjas doosraa he
 Till date no person from Uttar Pradesh has been President
 upi kii koi bhi party yah sandesh dena nahin chaahati ki jab upi ke vyakti ke raashtrapati hone kii baari ai tab unhone raste main rode atkaye the
 The same confusion exists between Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party
 bahujan samaaj party pramukh mayawati ko ramnath kovind kaa virodh karnaa isliye mushkil ho rahaa he kyonki vah bhi dalit hai
 On the other hand, if the opposition had already announced Meira Kumar as its candidate, it would probably have been easier for the BSP to take a decision
 vaise bhi samaajawaadee party ke paas sirf 2 xxrep 4 0 vot hai or bispi ke paas sirf 6000 vot
 Therefore, opposition to these two parties is not going to make much difference
 ab haalat yah he ki vipaksh kii baithak se pehle sirf chaar partiyaan aisi dikhti hai jo majbootee se ramnath kovind ke khilaaf apana ummidavaar utaarne ke paksh main hai
 Apart from Congress, Left, Trinamool Congress and Rashtriya Janata Dal, no one seems to be in favor of fielding candidates openly
 17 saal purana rishta aaj tut kii kagaar par he
 The oldest friends of politics are no longer able to trust each other
 ab rishte itane khattey ho gaye hai ki raahen alag kar lene kii hi baat chal rahi he
 JDU does not approve of Narendra Modi, so talks of 'divorce' are happening with BJP
 15 yaa 16 june ko is parakhri faisla hone kisambhaavna he
 Meanwhile, on the whole tussle, Advani has spoken to Nitish Kumar and Sharad Yadav over the phone
 mohabbat main jab shikayaton kaa daur shuru ho jaataa he, to yun samaj lijie ki nikaah se pehle hi talaak kaa vakt aa gaya
 The oldest friend in the political alliance has drawn such a sword between BJP and JDU that the relationship is now on the verge of breaking
 goa main bijepi kaa nayaa cheharaa ubhara, to jediu ne bhi tir taan liye
 All JDU leaders say in unison that the time has come to walk on different paths
 jediu main bijepi se 'talaak-talaak-talaak' kii aawaaj uthi to jediu ke adhyaksh or endie ke sanyojak ne jaraa sanyam se kaam liya
 The relationship was not guaranteed, but insisted on not paying attention to the statements for two-three days
 modi ke naam par sabase bada daanv khilne vaale bijepi ke adhyaksh se sawaal kiya gaya ki mahabharat main lankacand kahaan se aayaa, to party ke nae raaj ke nath ne kaha, 'meghnad se pucho'
 In this era of rhetoric, now the attitude is tough on both sides
 bijepi ke bhi or jediu ke bhi
 And time tells us that politics changes due to strict attitude, it is less, more is deteriorating
 bijepi ko ab is dard kaa ehsaas zyaada hoga, kyonki piem usee ko bananaa he or iske liye pantare bhi vahi dikhaa rahi
 Now it is to be seen in the theater of politics that these threats of divorce are just threats or whether a new flower is going to bloom in the coming days
 phir tisare morche kii kavayad hui tejakahane vaale kehete rahen ki hindustan main teesraa morcha nahin chal saktaa
 Keep saying that the Third Front will never be permanent
 lekin desh main jab bhi satta kaa sameekaran bigadataa he, centre or rajyon kii raajnneeti main uthal-puthal shuru hoti he, charchaa main sabase pehle third front hi aata he
 Once again, the existence of the NDA came under threat due to the establishment of the Modi rule in the BJP and the wind of the Third Front caught the momentum
 tisare morche kii hawa buland karne main aguwai kar rahi mamata banerjee ko jaise hi laga ki bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar sahyogi bijepi se daaman chhudaane ke liye kasmasaa rahe hai, unhone tisare morche ke liye daaman failaa diya
 JDU general secretary KC Tyagi also met West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and then announced that there was power to create a third force
 mulaakaat ke baad nitish kumaar ne khud bhi mamata banerjee ko phone kiya or tisare morche ko jeevandaan dene kii koshish ke liye badhai di
 Mamta Banerjee confessed that she is also in touch with Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik for the Third Front
 haalanki naveen patnayak kehete hai ki abhi tisare morche kii pariklpana karnaa jaldbaaji he
 Not yet in the mood to open his cards, Naveen Patnaik too showed his strength in Delhi on the lines of Patnaik Nitish
 vishaal swabhimaan raily kar odisha ko vishesh rajya kaa darja dene ke baat kii or isi dauraan kaha ki abhi dekhte hai ki tisare morche kii hawa kitna rang pakadati he
 Naveen Patnaik is adopting a policy of 'weight and watch'
 lekin ek baar mamata banerjee ko dhokhaa de chuki samaajawaadee party ne nitish kumaar ko tisare morche kaa aamantran dene main deree nahin kii
 The congress-ncp's hands and feet are in the air right now, but the sweat of the Congress is starting to wane
 congress or ensipi ne tisare morche ko 'khayali pilav' kaha he
 The Third Front cannot form a government on its own
 aisi baat kendriya krishi mantri sharad pavaar ne maharashtra ke sangli main media ke saath baatcheet main kahi
 Pawar said that no matter how much the Third Front tries, the government cannot form on its own
 use kisi naa kisi rashtriya party kii madad lene kii jarurat padegi hi
 Pawar also said that it is difficult for UPA or NDA to form government without taking regional parties like DMK, TMC together
 krishi mantri ne kaha ki 2014 ke pehle to loksabhaa ke chunaav hona asambhav laagta he

 He was replaced by Shikhar Dhawan, who was earlier named captain of the 'A' team
 tippaniyan Gambhir was once seen in the race for the role of captain in the senior national team, but due to poor form, he was dropped from the team

 ek or asaram kaa cheharaa benakaab ho gaya he
 Another person followed in the footsteps of Asaram in the name of advocating the Hindustani culture around the world
 duusare shabdon main wo bhi majahab or talim kaa safed chola odhakar yon shoshan kar rahaa tha
 This charge has been leveled by the woman, who, while working with him, has been a victim of his excesses for years
 wo maharishi mahesh yogi ke arabon ke empire kaa vaaris he, wo saikadon sansthaanon ke chairman se lekar uniwarsity kaa chancelar tak sab kuch tha
 After the allegations of sexual exploitation on Asaram and his son Narayan Sai, it is now another Santanuma man
 is baar bhi iljaamon se ghiranevaala shaks koi maamuli insaan nahin, balki arabon kii sampatti kaa wo vaaris he, jise duniya ab tak ek mashhoor ajukeshnist yani shikshavid ke taur par jaanati thi
 But the fresh charges of sexual exploitation on this educationist not only exposed the reality hidden behind his white robes, but also told how he was able to keep the matter under control by his influence and influence
 was successful
 iljaamon ke mutabik ek uniwarsity kaa ye chancelar apane hi saath kaam karanevaali ek mahila ke saath yon shoshan karata rahaa
 Sexual abuse for the entire seven years
 53 saal kaa girishchandra verma maharishi mahesh yogi uniwarsity, maharishi uniwarsity of management and technology or maharishi mahesh yogi vidyamandir schools kaa chancelar or chairman he
 Apart from this, he is also the director of the General of Maharishi World Center
 jane-maane yoga guru maharishi mahesh yogi ke shishy or rishtedaar girishchandra verma ke sitaron ke gardish main pahunchane kii ulti ginati pichley saal ke march maheene main tabhi shuru ho gai thi, jab unke khilaaf unheen ke skool main kaam karanevaali ek teacher or unke nijee sachiv kii patni ne saalon tak yon shoshan karne kaa iljaam lagaaya tha
 According to the police, she was investigating this complaint given to the Madhya Pradesh Women's Commission since those days, but now after the full ten months had passed, the police could arrest Girish Chandra Verma in this case
 verma ke nijee sachiv kii patni ne apni shikaayat main bataaya tha ki unhone 1998 se lekar 2011 yani puure saat saalon tak unke saath jyaadati kii or iske bare main kisi ke saamne munh kholane par jaan se maar daalane kii dhamkee di
 Apart from this, he sexually abused her at her whereabouts in Noida as well as made a pornographic video clip of her and then later blackmailed her under the name of this clip
 verma par lage in iljaamon ke baad bhopal police unhen pichley 9 maheene se lagaataar poochtacha ke liye bula rahi thi, lekin wo aane se anakani kar rahe the
 Eventually, the police nabbed him from his ashram in Bhojpur Road, Bhopal
 iske baad pehle to unase lambii poochtacha hui or phir unhen giraftaar kar liya gaya
 It seems strange to think that a university chancellor rapes a woman and makes a video clip of her to scare her
 lekin narayan sai ke kareebi girishchandra verma par kuch aisa hi iljaam he
 But this is not the only matter
 is teacher ke pati kii maane to chancelar mahoday ne ek baar unke saath bhi kukarm kiya he
 It is said that the human being is identified by his company and how the relationship between Narayana Sai with the Chancellor of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi University, Girishchandra Varma is clear from his picture
 girishchandra verma urf girish brahmacharee kaa sach sirf utana hi nahin he, jitna unke pie kii patni ne police ko di gai apni shikaayat main bataaya he, balki duniya ko hindustani sabhyataa or samskruti kaa paath padhaane vaale girish par or bhi kai iljaam hai
 If he believes himself to be a PA, he may call himself Brahmachari, but he has had relationships with not one or many girls
 or to or apane videsh dauron ke dauraan wo vahaan bhi ladakiyon se najdiki badhaate rahe hai
 By and large, Girishchandra Varma, as per the allegations, has been doing the same thing as Asaram and his son Narayan Sai in the name of religion and education, as the charge has been on Asaram and Narayan Sai

 modi sarkaar ek baar phir se teen talaak par roak lagane ke liye bill laane kii taiyaari main hai
 There may be discussion on bringing the triple talaq bill back in the Union Cabinet meeting on Wednesday
 haal hi main kendriya kanoon mantri ravishankar prasad ne spasht kiya tha ki unki sarkaar muslim mahilaon ke adhikaron kii raksha ke liye patibaddh he or sansad main phir se teen talaak ke khilaaf bill laaegi
 In the previous Modi government, the bill to ban triple talaq was passed in the Lok Sabha but was stuck in the Rajya Sabha
 vipaksh ke baari virodh ke chalate yah bill rajyasabha se paas nahin ho sakaa tha
 The opposition is seeking amendment of certain provisions of this bill
 rajyasabha main bhartiya janata party ke netritv vaali endie kaa bahumat nahin he
 Therefore, passing this bill in Rajya Sabha is a tough challenge for the government
 is bill ke paarit nahin hone par modi sarkaar teen talaak ke khilaaf adhyadesh lekar ai thi
 At the same time, with the dissolution of the 16th Lok Sabha, the bill against triple talaq pending in Rajya Sabha ended
 aapako bataa den ki agar koi bill loksabhaa se paarit hokar rajyasabha pahunchataa he or is dauraan loksabhaa bhang ho jaati he, to bill kaa astitv khatm ho jaataa he
 The Union Cabinet may discuss the decision to introduce a new bill to ban the immediate three talc at an upcoming meeting on Wednesday
 kuch din pehle kanoon mantri ravishankar prasad ne bataaya tha ki centre sarkaar teen talaak par pratibandh lagane ke liye sansad main bill lekar aegi
 So the government can move forward on this process and discuss the decision to introduce new bills in the upcoming meeting on Wednesday
 vipaksh rajyasabha main teen talaak bill kaa virodh karata rahaa he
 The opposition in the Rajya Sabha is strong because the number of members of the ruling party is less here
 haalanki loksabhaa chunaav main ant tak rajyasabha main bahumat ho jayega or uske baad modi sarkaar ke liye apane vidhaayi agenda ko aage badhaane main aasaani ho jaaegi
 Recently, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other mps have sworn in as ministers for the 17th Lok Sabha
 17 june se sansad kaa satr bhi shuru ho rahaa he jisamen yah bill laayaa jayega
 The NDA currently has 102 members in the Rajya Sabha, while the Congress-led UPA has 66 and the parties outside the two alliances have 66 members
 endie ke kheme main agle saal november tak lagbhag 18 siten or jud jaaengi
 The NDA may also get the support of some nominated, independent members
 yadi buudhvaar ko kendriya mantrimandal dwaara manjuuri de di jaati he to 17 june se shuru hone vaali 17 veen loksabhaa ke pehle satr main nayaa vidheyak pesh kiya ja saktaa he

 ' uri hamale or sargical strike ke baad deshbhar main pakistani kalakaaron ko lekar tikhi pratikriya hui thi, jisaki jad main kuch filmein bhi ain
 The release of Ae Dil Hai Mushkil may have become easier, but the attitude of the owners of single screen theaters is sure to affect the earnings of single screen films in Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka and Goa

 Chief Minister Siddaramaiah may withdraw his Chamundeshwari assembly seat in Old Mysore but he is facing a tough fight with bjp's tribal leader Sriramulu in Badami seat in North Karnataka
 india today-exis maay india agsit pole ke data kaa gaharaai se vishleshan karne se pataa chalata he ki mining king reddy bhaaiyon ke behad kareebi shriramulu ne badami seat par mukhyamantri siddharmaiya ke paseene chhutaaney main koi kasar nahin chodi he
 It is interesting to see from the analysis of exit poll data that the Reddy brothers themselves did not do as well as the BJP had expected from the seats they fought
 agsit pole kaa anumaan he ki gali janardan reddy ke bade bhai ji somashekhar reddy bellari shahar main congress ummidavaar anil laad ke saath kade mukaable main fanse hai
 At the exit poll Bellary Rural seat, Sriramulu's close relative Sanna Fakirappa is shown lagging behind Congress' b Nagendra
 mining ke kshetra main nagendra bhi bada naam hai
 According to the exit poll, Sriramulu's nephew TH Suresh Babu, in Kampali seat in Bellary district, is also in a bad state in front of Congress candidate JN Ganesh
 agar reddy bhaaiyon ke karibiyon ko apni seat jeetne ke liye kadi mashkkat kerani pad rahi he to karnataka ke votaron kii ore se ye bijepi ko bada sandesh hoga
 The BJP had placed eight bets on Bellary's infamous Reddy brothers and their clan and close ones in order to improve the party's prospects in Hyderabad Karnataka and Central Karnataka
 kul milakar bijepi ne bellari, raichur or chitradurg jaise teen jilon kii 22 siton kaa incharge reddy bhaaiyon ko banaaya tha
 Axis My India sent its surveyors to all 222 seats in Karnataka where voting took place on Saturday, 12 May
 mushkil or kaante kii takkar vaali seat us seat ko mana jaataa he jahaan vijeta or duusare nikatatam ummidavaar ke bich voton kaa antar 2% se kam rahata he
 Talking about other VIP candidates from Karnataka, bjp's face for the post of Chief Minister BS Yeddyurappa has an edge in his stronghold Shikarpura according to exit poll data
 isi tarah janata dal secular (JDS) ke pradesh adhyaksh ech di kumaraswami apni seat ramnagaram main aaramdaayak sthiti main hai
 On the counting day of Keymangalwar, the entire fortress of the fort of Karnataka rests on the 36 seats where the Axis My India exit poll has shown a lot of competition
 ye seat karnataka ke alag-alag kshetron main faili hai
 Bombay is a 10-seat sword-fighting contest in Karnataka
 isi tarah hyderabad karnataka main 8, central karnataka or coster karnataka main 5-5, bengalooru or old mysore main 4-4 siton par kaante kii takkar kaa anumaan he
 If 36 seats with these contests are excluded, according to exit poll data, Congress is seen winning 89, BJP 73 and JDS 24 seats
 agar congress ko apane boote bahumat hasil karnaa he to use in 36 kaante kii takkar vaali siton main se adhiktar par jeet hasil kerani hogi
 At the same time, the BJP is confident that the party's superior organizational skills will ultimately outweigh the Congress in the contested seats
 bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah kii gananaa ye he ki party or sangh ke cader ne bijepi ke votaron kaa ghar se nikaalkar poling booth tak laane main bahut acha kaam kiya
 With the Congress, the poor and the BJP rich, the voters of the rich are divided by income, the study of Axis Exit Poll data shows that the popularity of the Congress is the highest in the low income group of Karnataka
 jaise jaise aamadani kaa dayera upar kii ore badhata he, yani ucch aay virgon main, vaise vaise congress kii lokapriyata kaa graph ghatata jaataa he
 Congress has a vote share of 40% in the BPL families living below the poverty line
 iske alaava jin logon kii aay 11000-2 xxrep 4 0 rupee ke bich he, unamem 33% kaa samarthan congress ko hasil he
 Among those whose income is more than Rs 31,000, the Congress has only 20% vote share
 vahiin bijepi ko dekha jaae to karnataka ke amir votaron kaa bada vot share yani 54% party ke paas hai
 At the same time, only 34% of the voters in BPL families are seen standing with BJP
 bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah jahaan party ko garibon kii party ke taur par branding karne kii koshish kar rahe hai, vahiin unki ye koshish karnataka chunaav main shaayad kargar hoti nahin dikh rahi he
 With the Congress on the hands of the uneducated, the trust of the educated is seen in the exit poll data of Karnataka about the pyramid of BJP education
 The more educated the voter is, the more inclined the BJP is towards the BJP
 karnataka ke ashikshit votaron main 47% vot share congress ke paas he
 The tenth pass is Congress with 36% of the voters and 33% of the graduate voters
 duusari taraf bijepi ke paas graduate votaron main 41%, dasvin paas votaron main 37% or ashikshit votaron main 29% vot share he
 The ethnic Chakravyuh of Karnataka has 76 seats in Bhednakarnataka where the Lingayat community is considered to be in a decisive position
 congress ko 2013 vidhansabha chunaav main in siton main se 48 par jeet hasil hui thi

 2013 karnataka vidhansabha chunaav main bies yediurppa ne apni alag party karnataka janata pakshaa (KJP) banaakar bijepi kii sambhaavnaaon ko karaari chot pahunchaai thi
 This time, bjp's seat count is expected to increase from 18 to 40 seats in Lingayat-dominated seats
 karnataka main muslim samudaay ke prabhaav vaali 13 seat hai
 Here the Congress seat number can increase from 8 to 11
 vahiin aisi siton par JDS kaa aankada 3 se ghatakar 1 par aa saktaa he
 There are 54 seats in Karnataka dominated by Vokkaligga community
 in siton par congress or JDS kaa aankada kamovesh vaisaa hi rah saktaa he jaisaa ki 2013 vidhansabha chunaav nateezon main aayaa tha
 In Old Mysore, BJP seems to be improving a bit this time compared to 2013
 yahaan vokkaligga belt main bijepi ko 11 seat hasil hone kaa anumaan he
 In the 2013 assembly elections, the BJP had to satisfy itself with 8 seats

 ) loksabhaa chunaav 2019 kii jang ab tej ho gai he, netaaon ke bhaashan or bayaanbaji bhi apane charam par he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed a public meeting in Wardha, Maharashtra on Monday and targeted the Congress on the issue of Hindu terrorism
 saaf he ki chunaav se pehle bhaajapa ne ek baar phir hindutv card khelaa he, jise vah aane vaale dinon main bhunaa sakati he
 Narendra Modi had earlier visited Wardha during the 2014 elections also, there is a lot of difference in the speech of then and now
 padhein modi ke 2014 or 2019 ke bhaashan main kitna badlaav aayaa
 
 
 PM played the card of Hindutva from Maharashtra in Wardha, Maharashtra, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said, "can any Hindu ever be a terrorist? congress-ncp can fall for vote bank politics to any extent, they have insulted all Hindus by calling crores of Hindus as terrorists
 ’’bhaashan main kab-kis par waar ?apane 32 minute ke bhaashan main pradhanmantri ne kul 6 minute hindu ke mudde par baat kii
 He also targeted Rahul Gandhi from his Kerala Wayanad seat unnamed, when he said that some people are contesting from a seat where Hindus are in minority due to fear
 iske baad pradhanmantri ne kul 5 minute rashtravaadi party (NCP) pramukh sharad pavaar ko aade haathon liya
 He targeted Sharad Pawar's politics, issues with the Congress and the feud going on in the family
 agar piem ke puure bhaashan ko sunen to unhone aadhe se adhik samay tak aatankwaad, airstrike, rashtrawaad or pakistan ke mudde par baat kii
 It is also worth noting that in his speech, the PM spent the least time on counting the achievements of his government and talking on issues related to Wardha
 maharashtra ke is ilaake main kisaanon kii aatmahatya bada mudda rahi he, ek aankade ke mutabik is kshetra main abhi tak kareeb 14000 hajaar kisaan aatmahatya kar chuke hai
 The PM spent just 3 minutes of his speech talking about the work done by the farmer, his government for the farmers
 pradhanmantri ke bhaashan kii shuruyaat A-SAT launch ke saath hui or phir puraa bhaashan hindutv ke mudde par hi kendrit rahaa
 What was special in the 2014 speech? Even when Narendra Modi was the prime ministerial candidate in the last Lok Sabha election, he had held a meeting in Wardha and his speech was very different from the speech now
 20 march 2014 ko die gaye 32 minute ke bhaashan main tab 18 minute tak kisaanon ke mudde par baat kii thi or tab kii upie sarkaar kii aalochana kii thi
 Regarding politics on the issue of farmers, the issue of suicide or the example of Gujarat, the PM had talked a lot on the issue of farmers
 iske alaava jawan or aatankwaad par piem ne dhai minute jinamein adhiktar OROP kii baat thi
 The remaining ten minutes gave a speech targeting congress-ncp and raising the slogan of Congress Mukt Bharat

 ab unke saath kaam kar chukin ek theatre artist ne bataur insaan unhen jhootha qaraar diya he
 Writing a long Facebook post on Friday, the theater artist said - Nawazuddin, you still do not respect women
 ye artist koi or nahin sunita rajvar hai
 He has worked with Nawaz
 apni kitaab An Ordinary Life: a Memoir main navaj ne sunita ko pehla pyaar bataate hue likhaa ki garibi kii vajah se unhone unhen chhod diya tha
 According to the news, angry with the content of the book, Sunita is thinking about a case against Nawaz
 4 khulaase: 18 saal pehle saath kaam kar chuke navaj ko nahin pahachaanate the aamir khananwaaj ne apni kitaab main apane kai afares kaa khulaasa kiya he
 This includes co-actresses who work with her, from hotel waitresses
 pehle pyaar kaa khulaasa karte hue navaj ne sunita rajvar kaa naam liya tha
 He claimed that when he had a breakup due to unemployment, he started thinking about suicide
 navaj ne 'miss lavali' kii ko-actress niharika singh ke saath relationships se jude sansanikhej khulaase kiye hai
 Like Sunita, Niharika also called Nawaz's words vulgar and called it a cheap gimmick of selling books
 sunita ne apni fasebuk post main aarope lagaaya ki unhen lekar navaj ne kai jhooth bole hai
 The real reason for Nawaz's leaving was not what he said
 aisa bilkul nahin tha
 Such was Nawaz's first film of Miss Lovely, objections to 157 Scenes, what was written in the post - Says luck can change, not human nature
 navaj kii kitaab padhakar kuch esa hi laga or yakaayak ‘melaram vafaa’ kaa ek sher yaad aa gaya, “ek baar usne mujhako dekha tha muskuraakar, itani si hakeekat he baaki kahaniyaan hai”
 Because this biography has only been printed to a large extent, not the truth, many things Nawaz has written in his mind, according to his and in his own right, Chit Bhi Meri Pat Bhi Merry Types
 unhone badi hi khubsuurati se khud ko bura bhi kah diya he or utani hi khubsuurati se apni buraai kaa sara thinkara auraton par phod diya he
 Especially on me, because if they believe, after me, their love and trust from women had been lost and all their emotions had become RIP i
e
 rest in peace
 baharhaal, unki biography main jahaan tak meraa sawaal he to unke jhooth kaa falsafa vahiin se shuru ho jaataa he, jahaan se meraa zikr, yani shuruyaat kii pehali do line se hi, jahaan nawaz kah rahe hai ki wo mujhe enesdy main kabhi nahi mili
 He was my senior one year in NSD, so of course he would have met
 haa us vakt hamaare bich kuch tha nahin, lekin ye kahana ki kabhi mili hi nahin, ye atapata sa zarur lagata he
 Suicide, who wanted to rule Nawaz's life because of his girlfriend, he said that i used to do art work in the walls of his house, carve our names, make hearts, through which sometimes arrows also passed
 used to do
 ye padhakar esa laga maano main unase milane nahin, balki unki arts and crafts class lene jaati thi
 The extent was reached when he wrote in a romantic Bollywood movie style that after our break-up he took a bucket of white paint and wiped my art-work off the wall and me with a brush
 ab sawaal ye uthta he ki jab maine kabhi koi art-work banaaya hi nahin tha to wo kiske art work ko mitaane kii baat kar rahe hai?chalo in choti-choti baton ko nazar andaaz bhi kiya ja saktaa he, lekin asli khel to unhone vahaan khelaa jahaan hamaare brake-ap kii baat ai
 Nawaz has always been a Sympathy seeker, he does not leave anything from where sympathy can go, sometimes with his complexion, sometimes with poverty, sometimes by saying that he has done the job of Watchman, while the truth is This is that his family background was better than my family background at that time

 maine tumhaara phone lenaa chhod diya tha, kyonki ghin aati thi tumhaare bare main sochakar, baat kya karti tumse
 i never said that you focus on your career and i myself
 ab jab tum sab hadein paar kar hi chuke ho to ye bhi jaan lo ki maine tumhen kyon choda tha, maine tumhen isliye choda tha kyonki tum hamaare sambandh kaa mazaaq banaate hue sab vyaktigat baaten hamaare kaaman frends ke saath share kiya karte the
 Then i came to know what you think about woman and love
 doosraa bada jhooth jisane mujhe ye post likhane ke liye majaboor kiya wo ye ki tumhaare safal hone par maine logon ko ye bataanaa shuru kar diya ki kabhi tumhaare or mere gahare sambandh the

 phir itnaa bada jhooth kyon nawaz, agar bahut sachche banate ho to un longo kaa naam bhi chhap dete apni biography main jinke saath main tumhaare hisaab se tumhaare safal hone ke baad hamaare sambandhon kaa bakhaan kiya karti thi
 You have written that i was your first love, like the first rain in a drought, if this was the first love, then God may not let anyone get such first love
 aaj naam he tumhaara, acha kaam kar rahe ho, isliye tab to nahin kaha tha, par ab jarur kahuungi ki apane kariyar par focus karo
 i left you not because of your poverty but because of your poor thinking
 tumne apni biography se sabit kar diya ki main jis nawaz ko jaanati thi tum aaj usase zyada garib ho
 Neither did you know how to respect women then and neither could you learn now
 tumhaare halaat par bas itnaa hi kahuungi, “ ja, tu shikaayat ke kaabil hokar aa, abhi to meri har shikaayat se tera qad bahut chota he”

 Digvijay Singh said on Thursday, 'heartiest congratulations to all the teachers on Teachers' Day
 atithi shikshak va atithi vidwaan shikshakon ko congress vachan patr main kiye gayi vaadon ko hamen puraa karnaa he
 i am confident that Chief Minister Kamal Nath will fulfill every promise made in the Congress promissory note
 'madhya pradesh vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan congress ne satta main aane se pehle die gaye vachan patr main pradesh ke atithi shikshakon ko niyamit karne kaa vaada kiya tha
 The Congress had said that teachers would be regularized within three months of coming to power
 purv main congress karyaalay main ek press conference karke gurujiyon kii bhaanti atithi shikshakon ko bhi niyamit karne kii ghoshnaa kii thi, jisaki guarantee purv mukhyamantri digvijaisingh ne lee thi, or kaha tha ki 90 dinon ke bheetar atithi shikshakon kaa niyamitikaran kiya jayega

 yahi vajah he ki digvijay singh ne kamalnath se shikshak diwas par shikshakon se kiye gaye vaade ko puraa karne kii yaad dilaai he

 It is now Kamal Nath's responsibility to fulfill every promise made by himself
 taaki mapra kii janata kaa vishwaas congress main bana rahe
 'it has been just 8 months since the Congress got power in Madhya Pradesh after 15 years
 madhyapradesh congress kii gutbaji ab charadivari se baahar sadak par aa gai he

 vahiin, jyotiraditya sindhiya ke samarthak khulkar apane netaa ko madhya pradesh congress adhyaksh banane kii maang kar rahe hai

 With the passing of time and age, Dhoni's batting got a little lethargic and 'mahi' was the target of critics in recent times due to slow batting
 kai log to yah baat bhi kehane se nahin chuke ki dhoni ko vanade or tii20 kii bhartiya team main jagah nahin milani chahie
 However, Dhoni proved the point of 'old is Gold' by his performance in ODI series against India (australia vs Australia)
 unhone na keval siries main team india ko jeet dilaane main ahm bhoomika nibhaai balki main of da siries bhi ghoshit kiye he
 Dhoni has given a befitting reply to his critics who were questioning his ability to bat
 vanade siries main dhoni ke is pradarshan ko australia ke purv captain ian chapel (ian Chapell) ne jamkar saraahaa he
 According to Chappell, Dhoni, who is 37 years old, is still the best finisher in the 50-over format

 Many times i thought, 'this time he shot a little late', but in a while i was surprised that he gave India a thrilling victory with two powerful shots
 ' unhone kaha, ‘vah baahar se jis tarah shant dikhataa he, vah koi bhram nahin he kyonki aise halaat main vah jis tarah se khud ko badalata he, vah is baat kaa saboot he ki uskaa dimag aisi paristhiti main behtareen dhang se kaam karata he

 As far as running between the wickets is concerned, you will definitely consider Bevan first, but even at the age of 37, Dhoni is one of the fastest run-scorers in the game
 ' chapel ne kaha, ‘ballon main sudhaar kii anumati dene or tii20 cricket main khilne ke phaayde se, aankadon ke hisaab se dhoni bevan se behatar he
 There can be no debate that Dhoni is the best one-day finisher
 ' pichley kuch samay main aalochakon ne dhoni kii dhimi pariyon kii aalochana kii thi lekin is khilaadi ne edilade main gaganchumbi chakka jadkar un sabhi ko chup kar diya
 Regarding the debate of the best ODI batsman, Chappell feels that Virat Kohli will surpass legendary players Viv Richards, Sachin Tendulkar and AB de Villiers and end his career as 'sir Donald Bradman of ODI'
 unhone likhaa, ‘kohli apni vanade ballebaaji ke tareeke se mujhe richards kii yaad dilaate hai, vah shandaar shot lagaate hai or kai paaramparik strokes par nirbhar hote hai
 If he continues to play at this current run pace, he will surpass Tendulkar's total centuries and will be about 20 centuries ahead of this little mater
 ' unhone likhaa, ‘agar vah in shandaar uplabdhiyon ko hasil karne ke kareeb bhi pahunch jaataa he to isamen koi shaq nahin ki vah vanade ballebaajon kaa sar donald breadman ban jaaenge

 Karnataka Governor Vajubhai Vala has made an unabashed but controversial controversy over girls' fashion
 unhone desh kii aadhi aabaadi ko salaah di he ki wo fishan or lipstick se dur rahen, kyonki college saundarya pratiyogita kaa plateform nahin he
 The Governor, in his address during the 103rd Indian Science Congress Conference, gave this advice not only to girls, but also to boys
 unhone kaha ki ladke or ladkiyaan khud itane samajhadaar hote hai ki unhen pataa hota he ki unki jindagi main kya mahatvapurn hai
 Sometimes they have to give up some things
 vajubhai vaala ne kaha, 'college jane vaali ladakiyon ko fishan nahin karnaa chahie, kyonki wo yahaan padhane aati hai na ki saundarya pratiyogita kii taiyaari karne
 There is no need for girls to get eyebrows set, lipstick applied and hair trimmed
 ' rajyapal ne in baton ko halke andaaj main kaha, jis par mahila samitiyon ne aapatti jataai he
 Although the student and others present at the University of Mysore supported this, a group of scientists present there dismissed the Governor's statement as incorrect
 sammelan main upasthit ek chaatra pallavi kaa kahana he ki saundarya or fishan kaa padhai se koi lenaa dena nahin hai
 It is a personal choice and decision as to who wants to keep themselves
 vah kahati hai, 'koun kahata he ki fashneble ladkiyaan samajhadaar or padhane main acchhee nahin hoti
 How can the governor make unnecessary comments on girls during such an important program related to science, instead of plans to pursue science

 In his speech, Imran Khan spoke about the communication system stalled in Kashmiri, the detention of citizens and leaders there

 Vidisha Maitra said, "india wants to bring Jammu and Kashmir into the mainstream
 ' unhone kaha ki jammu or kashmir bharat ke sampann or jeevant loktantr main vividhta, bahulwaad or sahishnutaa kii sadiyon puraani viraasat ke saath acchhee tarah se rah rahaa he
 With this, he said, 'citizens of India do not need anyone else to speak on their behalf

 'let us tell you that Pakistan has been continuously trying to raise the Kashmir issue in various global forums

 At the same time, an American MP asked Imran Khan why he did not raise the issue of Uygur Muslims of China on international forums like Kashmir

 He questioned Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan for not raising any voice against China
 elice wales ne kaha ki china ke jinjiyang praant main kareeb 10 lakh musalamaanon ko bandi banaaya gaya, lekin pakistan vah masalaa kabhi nahin uthaata
 Alice Wells said that i would like to see the same level of concern for the Muslims who have been imprisoned in western China
 ve vastav main kansentrishan jaisi haalat main hai
 Since you are deeply concerned about the human rights of Muslims in Kashmir, this concern demands further expansion

 At exactly six in the evening of February 6, when 17 leaders of the Punjab Core Group Lutyens were called to the bungalow at 2, Krishna Menon Marg in Delhi, the only agenda for this meeting with the high command was the Shiromani Akali Dal in next year's assembly elections
 Break the coalition from fight alone or keep the status quo
 rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah to baithak main khamosh rahe, lekin kendriya vitt mantri arun jetali ne chaar sawaal puche—rajnatik paristhiti kya he? bijepi akele chunaav lade to kitna phayda hoga? gathbandhan main ladenge to kisi sthiti hogi? kareeb dhai ghante chali baithak main rajya ikai ne ek sur main kahah maujuuda rajnatik halaat main bijepi ko akaliyon ke saath gathbandhan se koi laabh nahin he
 But three days after this meeting, when the Akali leader and Punjab Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Singh met Badal Shah and Jaitley, the attitude of the BJP cooled down
 sutron ke mutabik, shah ne badal ko bharosa dilaayaa ki gathbandhan jari rahegaa
 After this, Badal publicly announced, "akali-bjp alliance is permanent which cannot be broken
" ham saajha rup se chunaav jeetne kii ranneeti par kaam karenge
 "disappointed with this decision, a senior BJP leader reminds," four months ago (on October 11) when Prime Minister Narendra Modi presented Punjab Chief Minister Prakash Singh Badal on stage at an event held in Chandigarh, Nelson Mandela of India
 It was said that it was clear at the same time that the expectation of the workers was going to be suppressed
 '' haalanki bijepi kii ore se gathbandhan ke bhavishya ko lekar abhi koi aupchaarik elaan nahin hua he lekin bijepi ko punjab main apni takat kaa bakhubi ehsaas he
 Prime Minister Modi and Jaitley have a personal interest in Punjab
 modi bataur sanghathan mahasachiv soobe kaa prabhaar sambhaal chuke hai or unhen bijepi ke lihaaj se rajya kii siyaasi jameen kii urvartaa maaloom he, jabaki party ke sabase umdaa ranneetikaar maane jane vaale jetali modi lahar main bhi ek lakh se zyada voton se amritsar loksabhaa seat par chunaav haar chuke hai
 Regarding the meeting on the issue of alliance, Punjab BJP President Kamal Sharma says, "the alliance and political scenario was discussed in the meeting with the state unit
 '' jabaki rajya bijepi ke prabharee or rashtriya upaadhyaksh prabhaat jha kehete hai, ''hikeman ke saamne netaaon ne apni baat rakh di he or ab faisla hikeman ko karnaa he
 "the alliance became compulsive
 Punjab's political situation was formally reviewed by Shah, but Prime Minister Modi himself is so concerned about the state of the state that he sent Union Minister of State for Home Kiren Rijiju to Punjab and asked for a parliamentary region-wise report
" rigiju ne 31 janvari or ek farvari ko punjab jaakar har kshetra ke kaaryakartaaon se mulaakaat kar feedback liya
 According to sources, in a meeting with Rijiju, local BJP leaders expressed displeasure over the Akali government's way of working, and described the atmosphere as chaotic
 bijepi netaaon kaa dard sarkaar main shaamil hone ke baavjood doum darje ke vyavhaar ko lekar tha
 Only after this report, the Prime Minister gave instructions to call a review meeting
 bijepi kii daleel he ki bhale aaj kii sthiti main akaliyon se gathbandhan rajnatik rup se nuksaan pahunchane vaala he, lekin ranneetik lihaaj se laabh dene vaala he
 Punjab is a border state which has strategic importance and if the alliance breaks, then in this scorched fire of insurgency, there can be other consequences besides politics
 bijepi ke ranneetikaar is daleel ko aktubar 2015kii ghatana se jodate hai, jab guru granth sahib ke chori hue kuch panne kai ilaakon main bikhare hue mili jisase sikh samaaj bhadak uthaa tha or rajya main tanaav kii sthiti paidaa ho gai thi
 Linking the same terror attacks in Pathankot and Gurdaspur to the same, a BJP leader says, "the BJP is a national party and is currently in power at the Center, so in the case of Punjab, before the politics there is country interest
" sameekaran ke lihaaj se akali dal gaanvon main sikh samaaj kaa to bijepi shahari hinduon kaa pratinidhitiv karti he, aise main yah gathbandhan ekta-bhaichaare kaa sandesh detaa he
 Apart from these arguments, a BJP leader also said that now breaking the alliance will not help the party because it too is a partner in power for nine and a quarter years and cannot escape the anti-incumbency
 bijepi kii dabaav kii ranneetidesh hit main gathbandhan barkaraar rakhane kaa jajba mahaj dhai ghante kii baithak main nahin aa saktaa
 This situation was already in front of the BJP leadership
 lekin centre ke saath padosi rajya haryana main pehali baar bahumat kii sarkaar banane or maharashtra main 25 saal purana gathbandhan todakar kila fatah karne vaali bijepi ke hausale itane buland ho gaye ki usne punjab main bhi gathbandhan ko phir se taraazoo par taulne kii ranneeti bana lee
 a distressed BJP leader says, "we have a low stake in the state
" mahaj 20 fisadi hissedari ko gathbandhan nahin kaha ja saktaa
 The party came to power with a majority in the Haryana Assembly elections despite the Akali Dal supporting the bjp's anti-inld
 '' darasal, bijepi alaakaman kii ranneeti gathbandhan ke khilaaf gusse ko saarvajanik karne kii thi, isliye rajya ikai ke netaaon ko akali dal kii aalochana se kabhi roka nahin gaya
 bjp's strategy was to increase the number of seats by putting pressure on the Akali Dal
 bijepi vidhansabha kii kul 117 main se 23 siton par ladati he
 a party strategist says that in order to rationalize the alliance, the BJP should get at least 40 seats on which it has contested at some time
 haalanki akali dal ke tewaron se itnaa to saaf he ki bijepi kii siton kii sankhya nahin badaae vaali, lekin siton kii adla-badali jarur ho sakati he
 The organizational strength of the BJP is also the reason for remaining in the coalition by ignoring weak organizations and internal local activists
 bijepi or akali dal kaa gathbandhan 1997 se he, jisaki neenv us vakt padi thi jab 1996 main atal bihari vaajapeyi ke netritv vaali centre sarkaar bahumat kaa aankada juta rahi thi
 At that time, the Akali Dal and the BSP had an alliance, but the Akali Dal unconditionally supported the BJP
 tatkaaleen bijepi prabharee madan laal khurana ne is gathbandhan kii neenv rakhi
 Since that time BJP has been fighting on 23 seats only
 party kaa prabhaav shahari hindu ilaakon tak hi simit he
 Despite being a partner in power for so long, BJP has not been able to establish its strong base in all 117 assembly constituencies
 bijepi jahaan-jahaan chunaav ladati aa rahi he vahaan par uske booth kaaryakartaaon kii sankhya 10 se 15 ke bich he to kamjor ilaakon main yah sankhya 4-5 tak simit he
 The bjp's best performance in the assembly was in 2007 when it won 19 seats out of 23
 lekin teen turm tak amritsar loksabhaa seat ke saansad rahe navjot singh siddhu ke kade tevar party ke liye mushkil paidaa kar rahe hai
 Sidhu has been demanding the Akali Dal to break the alliance for a long time
 lekin is mudde par hui nirnaayak baithak main siddhu nahin pahunche
 Now there is speculation about him going in himself
 duusari taraf pradesh adhyaksh ko lekar bhi khinchataan jari he
 Current president Kamal Sharma is trying for a second term, but recently there was a dispute over his former personal assistant Jimmy Sandhu's alleged links with drug smugglers
 parivaarwaad or aap-congress factorloksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan desh bhar main acha pradarshan karne vaala endie punjab main pichad gaya tha jabaki pehali baar chunaav lard rahi aap ne desh bhar main se sirf punjab main chaar siten jeet leen
 It got three times the votes of the BJP and just two per cent less votes than the Akali Dal
 bijepi ke netaa maanate hai ki jis tarah sabhi halkon main aap ko vot mili usase akali sarkaar ke khilaaf maahaul kaa andaja lagaaya ja saktaa he
 The manner in which familism has increased in the government and the Akali Dal's dominance in business, the AAP and the Congress have made a big issue
 drugs kii badhati taskari, bhrashtachar kuch aise mudde hai jo maujuuda sarkaar ke khilaaf he
 However, the BJP says that when the anti-incumbency vote is distributed among the opposition factions, the akali-bjp will benefit from it
 ek netaa kehete hai, ''pichley chunaav main badal parivaar se alag hokar manpreet badal ne piples party of punjab banaakar chunaav ladaa to use 5 fisadi vot mili or prakaash singh badal sarkaar satta main waapas laut ai
 However, to count as an electoral issue in favor, the bjp-akali has some populist schemes and 100% power subsidy for agriculture
 jaahir he ki punjab main bijepi sambhavit parinaamon se sahami hui he, lekin use itnaa ehsaas ho gaya he ki vah rajya main akele dam par astitv kii ladaai bhar hi lard paaegi

 supreme court main shuukravaar ko hui sunwaayee ke dauraan jepi group management ne kaha ki court ke aadesh ke mutabik ab tak saadhe paanch sau karod rupee main se pehle 275 karod or disambar main 150 karod rupee adaa kar diye gayi hai
 Now, if the last installment gets more time to pay 125 crore rupees, it will be easy
 court ne 25 din or badha die
 Earlier, the Supreme Court had earlier granted till October 27 to return more than two thousand crore rupees to the investors
 yani 27 aktubar tak ye rakam supreme court kii registry main jamaa karaane kii shart thi
 After a lot of pleas from the Jaypee Group, the court first conditioned to deposit a thousand crore rupees
 is par bhi jepi group apni majaburiyaan bataata rahaa, kaha ki sampattiyaan bech kar adaa kar degaa
 But the court said that what is the guarantee that these rupees will be given to investors only by selling assets
 lihaaja rakam adaa karne tak koi sampatti bechney yaa lij par transfar karne par bhi roak laga di gai
 Then the matter arose on the condition of depositing seven hundred crores, but finally asked to deposit at least five and a half crores
 isse kam par supreme court kisi bhi tarah kii koi murauvvat baratane ko taiyaar nahin tha
 The Supreme Court had summoned the managers and directors of JP Associates several times in the court
 court ne saaf kah diya tha ki yaa to niveshkon ko flats diye jaaen yaa phir unki jamaa rakam par 14 fisadi byaaj kii dar se rakam lautaai jaae
 JP Associates repeatedly said that if they were allowed to lease the property around the 205-km-long six-lane Yamuna Expressway, they would pay the same amount to investors
 iske alaava isiaisiai bank main unke 593 karod rupee jamaa hai, lekin court jepi ke kisi bhi prastaav se santusht nahin hua, kyonki ve sabhi peshkash court kii najar main lachar thim
 After the strict attitude of the court, JP Associates has so far deposited Rs 425 crore in the registry of the Supreme Court, the rest has been deferred
 udhar court ne tamaam niveshkon ko bhi unke tamaam hit surakshit or sangrakshit rakhane kaa bharosa diya hua he
 On Friday, the court also relied on the plea of a home buyer, that the court is doing all the exercises to protect their interests

 Canceling or opposing the programs of Pakistani artists in the country has become a big case of this year, the artist community is seen opposing this matter
 kabhi aword vaapis kiye ja rahen to kabhi apane lekhan ke jariye iskaa jamkar virodh ho rahaa he
 Let us know about this whole issue: On October 9 this year, Ghazal singer Ghulam Ali of Pakistan held a concert in Mumbai
 lekin shivasena ke virodh ke baad is kaarykram ko radd kar diya gaya
 The Shiv Sena had warned the organizers of the concert to cancel the show, opposing the continuous firing from Pakistan
 gulam ali ke kaarykram ke aayojakon ne chetavanee ke maddenjar shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare se mulaakaat kii
 The organizers then decided to cancel the event
 shivasena kii film ikai ‘chitrapat sena’ ne kaarykram ke aayojakon ko patr likhakar kaha tha ki agar pakistani gayak kaa kaarykram radd nahin kiya gaya, to use shivasena or ‘deshbhakt janata’ ke gusse kaa saamana karnaa padegaa
 See the video, however, BJP did not support Shiv Sena's stand on this issue
 bijepi ne gulam ali ko 'shanti kaa doot' qaraar dete hue kaha he ki aisa doot kisi seemaa main bandhaa nahin hota he
 In this case, many veterans held their opinion: Ghulam Ali's protest is not justified: Union Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi termed Naqvigulam Ali's protest on October 9 in Mumbai as unjustified
 nakvi ne kaha, ‘yah uchit nahin he
 Ghulam Ali is the messenger of peace
 shanti ke aise doot par simaaon kaa bandhan nahin hona chahie
 For those who give a message of peace, boundaries should not be set
 ’jaane is maamle par gulam ali ne kya kaha:bharat main sho na hone par gulam ali ne kaha, 'sho cancil hone se main naaraaz nahin, dukhi hum
 Only the show programmers canceled it
 gulam ali ne yah bhi kaha ki upar vaale ne chaha to dobaaraa mauka milegaa ham apane audiyans ko khush karne kii puri koshish karenge
 He said the concert was not canceled on his behalf
 halaat aise nahin hai ki main prastuti duun
 He also said that he wants indo-pak relations to improve
 jagajeet singh ko apana acha bhai bataate hue ali ne kaha ki jahaan bhi un donon kii mulaakaat hui or unhone kaarykram pesh kiya
 Ali said, we were one
 gulam ali ne ajtak se khaas baatcheet yah bhi kaha ki jab bhi unke prashansak unhen pyaar se yaad karte hai, vah jate hai or kaarykram pesh karte hai
 Ali said, this type of controversy spoils people's voice
 main gussa nahin hum, mujhe chot pahunchi he
 Such things do not happen in love
 aakhir main unhone is panktiyon se apni baat khatm kii
 'it is a matter of time, keep quiet, if someone listens we will also say something'

 He said there is no limit to music
 'dilli ke samskruti mantri kapil mishra ne kaha ki pakistani gayak kaa swaagat he

 unhone twitor par likhaa, 'dukhad he ki gulam ali ko mumbai main anumati nahin mili
 i invite them to come to Delhi and do a concert
 sangeet kii koi seemaa nahin hoti
 'but this was not the case, Ghulam Ali was scheduled to show in delhi-lucknow in November and now it too was canceled
 gulam ali ne khud is baat kii pushti kii he or kaha ki suraksha kaarnon se vah vah bharat kaa apana sara program cancel kar rahe hai
 During an interview, Ghulam Ali said, 'politics is happening in my name and i am hurt by it
 jab tak ye chijen thik nahin hoti, tab tak main bharat nahin jaaoongaa
 The Ghazal singer has cited security reasons behind it
 iske saath hi teen disambar ko unka lakhanu kaa sho bhi radd ho gaya he
 Earlier, his Mumbai and Pune shows were canceled due to Shiv Sena's opposition
 CM kejariwal ne diya tha dilli main sho kaa aamantrangauratalab he ki pichley maheene gulam ali kaa kaarykram mumbai main rakhaa gaya tha, lekin shivasena kii dhamkee ke kaaran use radd kar diya gaya tha
 His program in Pune was also canceled shortly thereafter
 tab dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne unhen rashtriya rajdhani main sho ke liye aamantrit kiya tha
 He was scheduled to be in Delhi on 8 November
 duusari ore, upi ke mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ne bhi oktober main ek nijee mulaakaat ke dauraan gulam ali ko kaarykram ke liye aamantrit kiya tha
 After this, the Ghazal singer was to have a concert in Lucknow on December 3, but now after announcing that he will not travel to India, he will not be there either
 shivasena ne gulam ali ke pakistani hone ke kaaran dilli sarkaar ko bhi dhamkee di thi or kaha tha ki vah yah kaarykram nahin hone degi

 If there is a BJP government at the Center, then the voters of Chhattisgarh also contribute to it

 He has taken this pledge for the people of America
 ’’ unhone kaha, ‘‘unhone aapse iske (vetan) sahi istemaal ko sunishchit karne main madad karne kii apil kii he

 Till Parliament makes laws, we will order the Election Commission not to give election symbols to people with criminal background
 justise divai chandrachud ne kaha ki party ko manyata dete vakt chunaav ayog kahata he ki party ko kitne vot lene honge

 Although he can contest elections himself
 is tarah vah chunaav ladane ke adhikaar se vanchit nahin hoga

 The bench had heard the plea that demanded that a person should be barred from contesting elections in serious offenses for which the punishment is more than 5 years and if charges are framed against a person

 Such a person cannot contest elections from any political party

 AG KK Venugopal opposed this on behalf of the Center
 kaha ki ye chune hue pratinidhi hi tay kar sakate hai, court nahin
 Is this the work of elected representatives or the five judges sitting in this court? CJI Deepak Mishra had told the Center that we can add to our order that if the criminals are made candidates in the elections then they should not issue election symbol
 AG ne kaha ki agar aisa kiya gaya to raajnneetik dalon main virdohi ek- duusare par aapraadhik cese karenge

 In Jharkhand, the Aam Aadmi Party has come into controversy even before its formation
 sadsyta abhiyaan shuru hone se pehle hi party par apana varchasv banane ke liye kai guton main rassakashi shuru ho gai he

 jharkhand main in dinon aam aadmi party kii sadsyta abhiyaan kii aad main chanda ugaahi joro par he
 Alam is that the one who is coming to mind, has come out to make a member by putting a cap on his head
 ek-ek shahar main aam aadmi party ke kai-kai offis khul gaye hai
 Surprisingly, none of them have been recognized by the Central Committee of AAP till now
 aam aadmi party ne puure desh main nishulk sadsyta abhiyaan chalaa rakhaa he
 Under this, the work of connecting people with the party is being done
 lihaaja maukey kaa phayda uthaakar logon ne in dinon ranchi ke har bade chowk-chauraahon par aam aadmi party kaa road said karyaalay khol diya he
 Along with opening the office of the Aam Aadmi Party and making all the members, they are also engaged in fundraising

 The party's district convenor Ajay Chaudhary said that a free membership campaign is going on
 yah abhiyaan puraa hone ke baad un logon ke khilaaf karrwai kii jaaegi, jin logon ne galat kiya he
 After the terrorist attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama, the central government has started clamping down on the separatists
 hamale ke 8 din baad ghati main bade str par dharpakad abhiyaan chalaaya gaya, jiske tahat beeti raat kashmir main jamaat-e-islamic jammu and kashmir ke pramukh abdul hamid faiyaz samet 24 sadasyon ko hiraasat main liya gaya
 Officials are referring to this routine action, but it is believed that this step has been taken before the hearing on Article 35A in the Supreme Court on February 25, to prevent the atmosphere in the valley from deteriorating
 is karrwai se jude adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki yah algaavvaadi samooh taharik-e-hurriyat se sambhddha sanghathan par pehali badi karrwai he
 The Jamaat protested and issued a statement condemning the detention and said, "this step is a well-planned conspiracy to pave the way for further uncertainty in this area
" ’ sanghathan kii ore se daawa kiya gaya he ki 22 or 23 farvari kii darmyaani raat main police or anya agenciyon ne ek vyapak giraftaar abhiyaan chalaaya or ghati main kai gharon par chhapemari kii
 Also several leaders of the organization were arrested including Amir (chief) Dr
 abdul hamid faiyaz or vakil jaahid ali (pravaktaa) shaamil hai

 ection se bhadke ghati ke netaalgaavvaadi netaaon par nakel kaa jammu kashmir ke netaaon ne virodh kiya he
 Former Chief Minister of the province Mehbooba Mufti and People's Conference head Sajjad Lone have raised questions over the Centre's action
 mahabuuba ne faisle par sawaal uthaate hue twit kiya, 'pichley 24 ghante main hurriyat netaaon or jamaat sanghathan ke kaaryakartaaon ko giraftaar kiya ja chukaa he
 This step, taken arbitrarily, will complicate issues in Jammu and Kashmir
 kis binah par netaaon kii giraftaar hui? aap kisi shaks ko kaid kar sakate ho, uske vichaaron ko nahin
 On the other hand, Sajjad Lone also lashed out at the central government over the arrest of separatist leaders
 unhone twit karte hue likhaa, 'lagata he sarkaar giraftaar kaa phayda uthaanaa chaahati he, lekin saavdhaan ho jaaen kyonki 1990 main bhi badi taadaad main giraftaaryaan hui thim, netaaon ko jodhpur or desh ke alag-alag hisson main bheja gaya
 Things got worse yah pehle se aajamaaya hua ek vifal model he, kripaya yah band karen, yah kaam nahin aana vaala, halaat or kharaab honge
 'what is Article 35A Article 35A gives special rights to Jammu and Kashmir as a state under which the rights given are related to' permanent residents'

 Article 35A is only part of Article 370 of the Constitution
 is dhara ke kaaran duusare rajyon kaa koi bhi naagarik jammu-kashmir main naa to sampatti kharid saktaa he or naa hi vahaan kaa sthaayee naagarik banakar rah saktaa he
