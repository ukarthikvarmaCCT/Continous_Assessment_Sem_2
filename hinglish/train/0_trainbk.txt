 During the hearing of RJD leader Shahabuddin's case, the Supreme Court asked the Bihar government that if the lower court had provided Shahabuddin a lawyer for debate then what was the need to challenge that order in the High Court? agar shahabuddin adaalat se legal aid maang rahaa tha to usko dene main harz kya tha? is par bihar sarkaar ne kaha shahabuddin ko legal aid kii jarurat nahin thi or sarkaar legal aid kaa kharchaa nahin uthaanaa chaahati thi kyonki shahabuddin apane liye kisi vakil ko bahes ke liye niyukt karne main sakasham hai
 In fact, the sessions court had made Shahabuddin a lawyer through legal aid to argue in the pending cases against him, which was challenged by the Bihar government in the High Court
 or hai court ne seshan court ke aadesh par roak laga di thi
 After this, all the cases against him were stayed
 vahiin bihar sarkaar ne phir kaha shahabuddin ko bihar se transfar na kiya jaae or na hi cese ko

 maamle kii sunwaayee ke dauraan yachikakarta kii taraf se kaha gaya ki jis taraf pappu yadav ko bihar kii jail se dilli kii tihaad jail main transfar kiya gaya tha or maamle kii sunwaayee bihar main hi ho rahi thi usee tarah shahabuddin ko bihar se tihaad jail transfar kar maamle kii sunwaayee bihar main hi kii ja sakati he or agar jarurat hogi to shahabuddin ko video conferencing ke jariye adaalat main pesh kiya ja saktaa he
 The Supreme Court made it clear that the cases which are pending before the High Court will not interfere in them but we will definitely consider whether Shahabuddin should be transferred from Bihar to Tihar Jail or not
 jo maamle nichali adaalat main lambit hai unako dilli transfar kiya jaae yaa nahin, yaa phir shahabudin ko tihaad transfar kar nichali adaalat main sunwaayee jari rakhenge
 Shahabuddin can be produced in court through video conferencing if needed
 maamle kii sunwaayee buudhvaar bhi jari rahegi
 During the hearing, the court also quipped whether Shahabuddin really did not have the money to advocate for the debate
 varisht vakil jo unke liye supreme court main bahes kar rahe hai kya ve emicas hai

 During the hearing of the case, it was said on behalf of the petitioner that on the way, Pappu Yadav was transferred from Bihar jail to Tihar Jail in Delhi and the case was being heard in Bihar in the same way Shahabuddin was transferred from Bihar to Tihar Jail
 The case can be heard in Bihar itself and Shahabuddin can be produced in court through video conferencing if needed

 Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi has called a cabinet meeting at 5 pm on Wednesday
 is meeting main vidhayakon ke tikat ko lekar kuch bade faisle kiye ja sakate hai
 Significantly, on 20 February, the Manjhi government will have to get a vote of confidence to stay in the state
 is bich maanjhi ne kaha he ki main kisi party ke bare main nahin bol rahaa hum lekin hamaare paas vidhayakon kaa puraa samarthan he
 Earlier on Wednesday, before the Manjhi government's decision, the government approved the provision of an amount of three crore rupees in place of two crores every year for the next financial year to act on the recommendation of the members of the Legislature under the Chief Minister's Area Development Scheme
 
 bihar rajya mantrimandal sachivalay vibhaag ke vishesh sachiv ajay kumaar dvivedi ne bataaya ki mantriparishad kii baithak main 27 agendon par manjuuri di gai, jisamen 9 agenda prastaavit the or 18 agenda anya ke rup main shaamil kiye gaye the
 He said that the Council of Ministers has decided to pay 13 months salary instead of 12 months to policemen ranging from constable to inspector in one financial year as others
 dvivedi ne bataaya ki mantriparishad ne home gards ko pratidin die jane vaale maandey ko 300 rupee se badhaakar 400 rupee kiye jane, yatra bhatta 20 rupee se badhaakar 50 rupee kiye jane or 20 saal kii lagaataar seva puri karne vaale home guard ko seva ke baad deb lakh rupee maandey ke taur par die jane ko manjuuri di he
 Apart from this, he has been approved to increase his working period from 50 years to 60 years if he is physically competent
 unhone bataaya ki mantriparishad ne vibhinn panchayaton main nijee ucch madhyamik vidyalayon or inter kalejon ke ucch vidyalayon ko manyata dene ke liye adhinium main yathochit sanshodhan evam aarakshan ke praavdhaan sunishchit karne kaa nirnay liya he

 Manjhi will get the support of BJP! Before this, a big news may come out of the BJP camp just before the political upheaval in Bihar and just before the majority examination of Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi on 20 February
 bijepi vidhayak or pravaktaa vinod nand jha kaa kahana he ki party ke adhikansh vidhayak maanjhi sarkaar ke samarthan main vot karnaa chaahate hai
 Although the final decision has not yet come, but apparently this news can bring happiness to the Majhi camp
 vinod nand jha ne kaha, 'bijepi kii meeting abhi jari he
 But most of the mlas are of the opinion that votes should be taken in support of Jitan Ram Manjhi
 haalanki, is maamle main abhi aakhri or aadhikarik faisla nahin kiya gaya he

 The Shiv Sena leader said that Rahul Gandhi has not given any false assurance
 vahiin nitish kumaar kii sarkaar main mantri or bijepi netaa vinod narayan jha ne kaha he ki khubasurat chehron ke dam par vot nahin jite ja sakate
 More than that, the fact is that she is the wife of Robert Vadra, who is accused of being involved in many cases of land scam and corruption
 vah behad khubasurat hai, lekin uske alaava unki koi rajnatik uplabdhi nahin he
 Let us tell you that Priyanka Gandhi has been made the General Secretary in the Congress and she has been given the responsibility of Purvanchal

 Many Congress workers have also been demanding periodically to bring Priyanka to Uttar Pradesh

 Among the two dozen legislators elected by the Punjab government as parliamentary secretaries, BJP leader and MLA Navjot Kaur Sidhu, the legislator wife of cricketer Navjot Singh Sidhu, is also included
 shergill ne is niyukti kosanvaidhanik or laabh kaa padabatate hue ayog se turant karrwai kii maang kii he
 Taking advantage of the post of parliamentary secretary is unconstitutional, Shergill said that these 24 parliamentary secretaries are contrary to the Indian Constitution
 unhone apni shikaayat main samvidhan kii dhara 191 kaa hawala diya
 Under which the members of the Legislative Assembly will be disqualified if they hold the post of profit of the Government of India or the Government of a State

 The money that should be done for public welfare is being looted
 sarkaar apane karmchaariyon ko vetan kyon nahin detii
 Attacking the AAP-BJP government, Shergill said of the parliamentary secretaries of Nedilli that they neither take money nor board a government car
 dilli main sansadeey sachiv banaae gaye aap vidhayak sarkari ghar yaa ghar kaa kiraay tak nahin lete
 They have voluntarily moved forward to help in the work of the minister

 This step of the Yogi government is also being opposed
 ab isi tarj par dilli main bhagava rang kaa istemaal shuru ho gaya he
 a program was organized at Yamuna Vihar under the banner of Swadeshi Jagran
 isamen bijepi ke bade netaa, sangh ke varisht netaa shaamil hue
 In this program 51 e rickshaws were distributed to the poor, all of them saffron
 in bhagava i rickshon par pradhanmantri modi, kendriya mantri gadakari, bijepi dilli adhyaksh manoj tiwari or parshad pramod gupta kii tasviir lagi hui thi
 All these e-rickshaws were completely dyed in saffron
 is maukey par varisht sangh prachaarak prem goyal ne kaha ki bhagava rang hamaara saanskrithik rang he
 Those who oppose it talk of nothing
 goyal ne hunkaar bharte hue kaha ki 2025 tak sab bhagava bhagava ho jayega
 On the other hand, BJP councilor and Shahdara MCD chairman Pramod Gupta standing nearby said that in the coming days we will sit together and plan for the propagation of saffron color
 kya bijepi dilli main bhagava rang kirajnneetikar rahi he, is sawaal par pramod gupta ne kaha ki jinhen iskaa virodh karnaa he karne dijie, bhagava hamaare gaurav kaa pratik he or iskaa istemaal karne main hamen koi jhijak nahin he
 Ayesha Begum, who came to take an e-rickshaw in the program, told us what to do with color
 hamaare parivaar main 8 log hai or swayan i rickshaw chalaakar main unka pet bharungi
 Now the question is that in such a situation, how much saffron color can produce in Delhi like UP
 bihar ke dijipi gupteshwar pandey puure ection main najar aa rahe hai

 The jails where the raids were conducted include mainly Muzaffarpur, Hajipur, Gaya, Katihar, Siwan and Begusarai jails
 dijipi gupteshwar pandey ne 'ajtak' ko bataaya ki unhen kai dinon se bihar kii adhiktar jelon main kaaphi gadabadi kii shikaayatein mil rahi thim
 For this, they have ordered raids in all the jails simultaneously
 sutron ke anusaar, bihar kii zyaadaatar jail main jail minial kaa paalan nahin kiya ja rahaa he or vahaan par mobile phone or sim card kaa istemaal dhadlle se ho rahaa he
 The manner in which crime has increased in Bihar in the past, is a major reason for the criminals sitting in jail and the criminal incidents being conducted by them, and the government's eye is especially on the jail
 jaankaree ke mutabik begusarai jail se chhapemari ke dauraan police ko do mobile phone, ganja or chilam baraamad kiya gaya he
 It is worth mentioning that even before Independence Day in August last year, raids were conducted simultaneously in all the jails of Bihar, during which huge amount of suspicious items were recovered
 pichley maheene dijipi kaa padbhaar grahan karne ke baad sahi gupteshwar pandey puure ection main he
 To make the police fit, Gupteshwar Pandey is also randomly inspecting several districts and the police are also falling if any deficiency is found there

 Shikhar Dhawan's bat rained heavily in the first Test against Sri Lanka
 jisaki badaulat bharat ne srilanka ko galle test main haraakar 2 saal pehle mili haar kaa badla bhi le liya
 Shikhar Dhawan has been in his best form so far in the last 4-5 months
 champions trophy se lekar ab tak cricket ke teenon formats main dhawan kaa bolbalaa he
 In exactly the same way as Virender Sehwag, the former explosive opener of Team India
 test cricket, vanade yaa phir tii20 cricket ho shikhar dhawan ke khilne ke andaaj main koi antar najar nahin aata he
 There was no way back for Dhawan The path was not easy for Shikhar Dhawan, who returned to Team India through Easy Champion's Trophy
 pichley saal to shikhar dhawan kharaab form kii vajah se bhartiya team se baahar ho gaye the
 l Rahul and Ajinkya Rahane, who replaced Dhawan in Test cricket, odis and T20s, handled the opening
 shikhar dhawan ke out of form hone kaa bada kaaran unka strike rate tha
 The pressure of questions arising at his place in the team was also visible in Shikhar Dhawan's game
 IPL or champions trophy rahaa terning pointpichley saal newjiland ke khilaaf gharelu test siries main kharaab pradarshan ke chalate shikhar dhawan team se baahar ho gaye
 But after that Shikhar Dhawan did not give up and made his place in the Indian team thanks to his brilliant performance in domestic cricket and IPL season 10
 champions trophy main shikhar dhawan ne apane pichley toornament vaala form jari rakhte hue sabase zyada 338 ran banaakar lagaataar duusari baar golden bat kaa aword apane naam kiya
 After this, Dhawan also performed brilliantly on the West Indies tour
 jiske baad unhen srilanka ke khilaaf test team main chotil murali vijay kii jagah chunaa gaya
 Shikhar Dhawan stumbled 190 runs in the first Test against Sri Lanka and proved his selection right
 is dauraan shikhar dhawan kaa strike rate bhi shandaar rahaa
 Dhawan got the look of Shikhar Dhawan in Veeru's Yadgall Test, which reminded him of Team India's former explosive opener Virender Sehwag
 shikhar dhawan ne apana shatak 110 gendon main puraa kiya or baad ke 90 ran keval 58 gendon main banaae
 This can be gauged by their speed
 dhawan kii is pari ne ye bataa diya ki unke jaisaa visphotak ballebaaj bhartiya team ke liye bahut ahm he
 Because after the retirement of Sehwag, Team India had always been missing such a batsman, who would leave the opposing team out of the match in the early overs
 dhawan ne galle test ke pehle din ke khel ke duusare satr main 126 ran banaae
 After which he came in second in terms of adding the fastest runs in any session by Indian batsmen
 haalanki, vah virendra sahvaag ke 2009 main srilanka ke hi khilaaf ek seshan main sabase zyada 133 ran banane ke bhartiya record ko todane se bhi chook gaye
 Well Shikhar Dhawan's innings has warned Sri Lanka that their difficulties will not be reduced in the coming matches too

 Today, the birth anniversary of Jagadguru Adi Shankaracharya, who established four monasteries in India, is celebrating the entire Sanatan Dharma
 unka janm aathvin sadi main bharat ke dakshini rajya kerala main hua tha
 Shankaracharya's father died in his childhood
 bachapan se hi shankaracharya kaa rujhaan sanyasi jivan kii taraf tha
 But her mother did not want her to pursue a ascetic life
 kaha jaataa he ki 8 saal kii umr main ek baar shankaracharya jab apni maa shivataraka ke saath nadi main snaan ke liye gaye hue the
 There the crocodile caught them
 jiske baad shankaracharya ne apni maa se kaha ki wo unhen sanyasi banane kii anumati de de varanaa ye magaramchh unhen maar denge
 After which his mother allowed him to become a monk
 shankaracharya kaa nidhan 32 saal kii umr main uttarakhand ke kedarnath main hua
 But before this, he has discussed many from Hinduism to many orthodox ideologies, to Buddhist and Jain philosophy
 jiske baad shankaracharya ko advait parampara ke mathon ke mukhiya ke liye prayog kii jane vaali oopaadhi mana jaataa he
 Shankaracharya is the post of the highest religious guru in Hinduism, which is considered equal to the Dalai Lama in Buddhism and the Pope in Christianity
 is pad kii parampara aadi guru shankaracharya ne hi shuru kii thi
 Shankaracharya established four monasteries in 4 regions of India for the promotion and prestige of Sanatana Dharma
 unhone apane naam vaale is shankaracharya pad par apane chaar mukhya shishyon ko baithaaya
 After which, in these four monasteries, the post of Shankaracharya began to play
 deshbhar main dharm or aadhyatm ke prasar ke liye 4 dishaao main chaar mathon kii sthapana kii gai
 Those named Govardhan Math of Odisha, Sharda Shringeripeeth of Karnataka, Dwarka Peetha of Gujarat and Jyotirpeeth / Joshimath etc
 of Shankaracharya of Uttarakhand started the tradition of making the most deserving disciples among these four monasteries, which is still practiced today
 loksabhaa chunaav kii ghoshnaa ke baad bhale hi netaaon ke vaahan shahar kii chaudee sadakon se lekar gaanv kii tuuti-phooti sadakon par farrate ke saath daudane lage hon, lekin chunaav kii taarikh ne un logon kii pareshaani badha di he jinhone us dauraan vivaah kii tithiyaan tay kar lee hai
 Now such people have started changing their dates
 jyotishiyon kaa kahana he ki is varsh april or may main vivaah ke kai shubh muhoort he
 Pandit Jai Kumar Pathak explains that according to Mahavir Panchang, 11 days in April and 21 days in May are extremely auspicious for marriage, while according to Mithila Panchang, seven days in April and 14 days in May are auspicious for marriage
 Huh
 apane putr kaa vivaah tay kar chuke patna ke ramanivas kehete hai ki chunaav ke dauraan sabase zyada sankat vaahanon kaa hoga
 The owner will ask for the price of the vehicle, not only this, a certificate will be required to carry the vehicle
 vah bataate hai ki tilak ke liye or pareshaani hogi, agar aap paisa le ja rahe hai or pakade gaye to uskaa bhi pramaan dena hoga
 Here, after the election code of conduct comes into force, there are people who have to use the band banja to loudspeaker, elephant, camel and horse in marriage
 kaha jaataa he ki aise to vivaah ke liye chunaav aachaar samhita kaa kanoon lagu nahin hota he parantu laudspikar, bandbaja, hathi, ghoda aachaar samhita ke kanoon ke daayre main aata he is kaaran iske upyog ke purv anumati leni hogi
 It is important to note that in Bihar, voting is to be held from 10 April to 12 May
 chunaav ke kaaran rishtedaaron ko aane-jane main bhi logon ko pareshaani hogi
 The most troublesome people will get married on the auspicious time of April 17, April 23, and May 12
 bihar main 17 april ko bihar ke saat or 12 may ko chah loksabhaa kshetron main matdaan hai
 Although there is no vote on 23 April, but on 24 April
 idhar, community haul maalikon or hotalon waalon ke liye bhi vivaah ke liye shubh muhoort or chunaav kii tithi pareshaani kaa sabab ban gaya he
 Rakesh Kumar of Jalata Community Hall in Bellerode, Patna, says that there are 15 bookings for April and May weddings, but after the announcement of the election date, people are coming and changing it
 idhar, patna ke sadar anumandal adhikari mohammad naiyar ikbaal kehete hai ki vivaah par chunaav aachaar samhita lagu nahin hoti he lekin band baaja or laudspikar ke istemaal ke liye teen din purv prashasan se aadesh lenaa hoga
 By the way, the vehicle owners have made up their mind to meet the administration in this season of marriage
 bihar motor transport federation ke adhyaksh udai shankar singh kehete hai ki chunaav ayog or parivahan vibhaag ke sachiv se milakar jile main vaahanon kii sankhya ke hisaab se 10 se 15 pratishat vaahan chhodane kaa nivedan kiya jayega
 He says that there is no shortage of vehicles, only these need to be organized
 chunaav ayog ne congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi kaa intervyuu dikhaane vaale news channel ke khilaaf FIR darj karne kaa aadesh diya he
 According to the Election Commission, showing such an interview just one day before voting is a violation of the code of conduct
 ayog ne kaha ki intervyuu dikhaane vaale sabhi channelon ke khilaaf karrwai kii jaaegi
 The Election Commission has also immediately stopped showing Rahul Gandhi's interview
 iske alaava chunaav ayog ne congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ko bhi notice bhejkar jawaab talab kiya he
 The Commission has sought a reply from Rahul Gandhi by 5 pm on 18 December
 chunaav ayog ne rahul se poocha ki aakhir aachaar samhita ulanghan karne par aapke khilaaf karrwai kyon na kii jaae? agar rahul gandhi 18 disambar tak apana jawaab nahin dete hai, to ayog unke khilaaf karrwai kar saktaa he
 Actually, an exclusive interview of Rahul Gandhi was shown in a Gujarati channel today, in which Rahul fiercely attacked the Gujarat government and Modi government
 rahul ne intervyuu ke jariye piem modi se kai sawaal puche or unhone daawa kiya ki gujarat main congress kii sarkaar banane ja rahi he
 The BJP raised questions about this interview of Rahul just a day before the second phase of voting
 bijepi ke mutabik channel ne chunaav aachaar samhita kaa sidhaa ulanghan kiya he or is maamle kii usne chunaav ayog main shikaayat kii, jiske baad ayog ne channel par shuruaati karrwai karte hue FIR darj karne kaa aadesh diya he
 Actually, votes will be cast on Thursday for the second phase of Gujarat Legislative Assembly elections
 isse pehle buudhvaar ko congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi kaa gujarati channel ko diya gaya intervyuu prasaarit hua
 On this, the Gujarat BJP has termed the interview in the Election Commission as a violation of the code of conduct
 maaloom ho ki rahul gandhi kaa gujarati channel ko die intervyuu main bijepi par jamkar hamalaa bolaa tha
 In the interview, Rahul said that the election of Gujarat is going to be one sided
 unhone kaha, ''congress netaaon ne mujhe gujarat main zyada campan karne ko manaa kiya tha, lekin mujhe kaam main intrest he, rigelt main nahin
 It is written in Gita: Do work, don't worry about the fruit
 main usee ko maanata hum
 Rahul said that the Congress party is an old-minded party
 gujarat main bijepi ke paas koi vijan nahin he
 Modi has not kept any vision before the people of Gujarat
 modi yaa to apni baat karte rahe yaa phir congress ke bare main bolte rahe lekin gujarat ke liye unhone kuch nahin kaha

 'input: IANS The controversy over the letter of Indian lawmakers to President Barack Obama for not granting US visas to Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi took a new turn when California's Department of Forensic Document Examiners said the mps 'signature was' genuine and authentic ' Huh
 patr kii forencik jaanch ke baad report main kaha gaya ki dastavej ek baar main taiyaar kiye gayi or is par geeli syaahi ke vaastavik, pramanik hastakshar hai
 a similar conclusion was found in the letter of the members of the Lok Sabha
 rajyasabha or loksabhaa ke sadasyon dwaara obama ko beete varsh kramash: 26 november or paanch disambar ko patr likhe gayi or in patron ko 21 july ko white house phir se fax kiya gaya
 The writing of these letters was forensic examined by Nanette M
 Bartow of California's Forensic Document Examiner
 kuch saansadon sipiem netaa seetaram yechuri, sipiai ke empi achyutan or dramuk ke capi ramlingam dwaara obama ko likhe patr par hastakshar se inkaar karne ke baad modi ke khilaaf abhiyaan chede sanghathan colicen against jinosaida (sieji) ke aagrah par yah jaanch kii gai
 a group of forty Indian American organizations are campaigning against American visas to CAG Modi
 forencik jaanch report par pratikriya maangane par achyutan ne kaha ki unhen is tarah ke kisi gyaapan par hastakshar karne kii yaad nahin he
 He said that all he remembers is that he had signed a letter expressing displeasure over the detention of Muslim youths in various parts of India, especially in northern states, as terrorists
 ramlingam ne kaha ki yah visheshadhikaar kaa maamla he jise sabhapati hamid ansaari ke paas bheja janaa chahie
 He said, 'I have already said that i have not signed the letter
 ’yechuri ek sansadeey pratinidhimandal ke saath uttar korea ke daure par hai isliye unki tippanee nahin lee ja saki
 Yechury had said that he had not signed the letter and that his alleged signature on the document was a 'cut and paste job'
 sieji ke raja swami ne daawa kiya ki forencik jaanch sabit karti he ki dastavej pramanik hai
 Forensic investigation has proved that nothing has been done like picking up the signature in one of the documents in the paper copy or electronic format and copying it from one place to the other and the signatures in the two documents are different
 sieji ke pravaktaa swami ne kaha ki chunki kuch sansad sadasyon ne in patron kii vishwasaneeyata par sawaal uthaate hue yaa to hastakshar nahin karne yaa hastakshar kii baat yaad nahin hone kii baat kahi thi jisase sieji ne donon patron kii vishwasaneeyata satyapit karne ke liye peshewar forencik pareekshakon ko shaamil karne kaa faisla kiya

 The year 2012 will also write a new chapter of Arab awakening and may tell us who will be dominated by Islamic political powers, Arab military establishments and civil society in the new Arab system

 # Gurugram — Tanvi Srivastava (@tanvisrv) April 12, 2016 So, 'gurugram' has been trending on Twitter for the last 24 hours now, and we have brought a few selections out of many tweets here, some of which say that the Haryana government should not waste time in name change, While some are worried about how the prices of land and property in 'gurugram' will increase or decrease
 
 
 or haa, hamaare-aapke jaise aam logon ne hi nahin, jaani-maani hastiyon ne bhi 'gurugram' ko lekar hansi-mazaaq karne main koi kasar nahin chodi
 
 
 Another interesting thing is that in some tweets, the song 'gur Nalon Ishq Mitta' by Punjabi singer Malkit Singh, who became very famous in India almost three decades ago
 
 
 ' bhi dobaaraa saamne nazar aayaa
 
 
 By the way, here we are writing this news, and right now # Gurugrammars (living in 'gurugram') and non-gurugrammars (not living in 'gurugram') are constantly active, and tweets are increasing

 After the demise of Santosh Mohandev, Sushmita came forward to hold her political legacy
 2014 main congress ne unhen silchar se tikat diya or vah vijay hasil karne main safal raheen
 Sushmita Dev is particularly known for raising women's issues
 unhone 3 talaak bill kaa bhi taarkik tareeke se virodh kiya
 She strongly opposed the imposition of GST on sanitary pads and did not rest in peace until she was relieved
 aksar apane matadaataaon se judane ke liye sushmita fasebuk live kaa prayog karti hai
 His speeches in the Lok Sabha many times made media headlines
 party main unke yogadan ko dekhte hue unhen ol india mahila congress kaa adhyaksh banaaya gaya he
 Sushmita Dev was born on 25 September 1972 in Silchar, Dist
 Cachar
 sushmita dev kii mata bithika dev bhi party main sakriy rahi hai or assam se vidhayak bhi chuni gayi
 Sushmita too made politics her profession and started it with Silchar municipality
 sushmita ne dilli ke miranda house se political science main 1993 main grajuation kiya tha
 Sushmita did her Bachelor in Law from Thomas Valley University in London
 yahaan se sushmita ne 1997 main apana course puraa kiya tha
 Sushmita Dev strongly opposed the triple talaq bill and came out as an outspoken leader of the party
 teen talaak bill par ho rahi bahes main bhaag lete hue unhone kaha ki yah kanoon muslim mahila ke shashaktikaran ke liye nahin balki muslim aadamiyon ko doshi qaraar karne kaa bill he
 He said that there is more emphasis on punishing men through this bill than to bring justice to women
 sushmita ne maang kii ki ise scrootni ke liye ise joint sillection cameti ke paas bheja jaae
 There is currently a BJP government in Assam
 congress ne sushmita dev ko ol india mahila morcha kaa adhyaksh banaakar unhen khaas tavajjo di he
 Sushmita also leaves no opportunity to surround the BJP
 kul milakar jis tarah se party main unka kad bad rahaa he usase aisa lag rahaa he ki agar congress kabhi satta main vaapasi karti he to sushmita dev ko koi badi jimmedaari milani tay he

 chunaav ayog ne vidhayakon kii arji ko khaarij karte hue kaha ki is maamle main sarkaar se jude beurocrates or karmchaariyon ke cross ejamination kii jarurat nahin he kyonkiophis of profitke is puure cese main jis tarah ke dastavej or saboot chunaav ayog ke paas he usamen kisi vyakti vishesh kii gavaahi kaa koi mahatv nahin he
 The petition rejected by the Election Commission, 20 mlas of the Koam Man Party challenged in the Delhi High Court, after hearing the High Court has now issued a notice to the Election Commission asking them to give their clarification in this matter
 'ham maamuli sa adhikaar maang rahe'hoicourt ke faisle par vidhayak adarsh shastri ne kaha ki aaj hoicourt main dedh ghante tak lambii bahes chali
 The court has given the next date till November 1 and till then the Election Commission will not take any action
 ham shuruyaat se hi yah kehete aae hai ki ayog ne jis aadhaar par galat faisla liya, jin logon ne kaagaj main bayaan diya un logon se ham sawaal-jawaab karnaa chaahate hai
 We are asking for a minor right
 ek anya vidhayak madan laal ne bhi is faisle par khushi jataate hue kaha ki sawaal-jawaab kii list main jiedi vibhaag, vidhansabha ke kuch karmchaaree, sachivalay ke kuch karmchaariyon ne chunaav ayog ko likhit main bayaan die hai
 It is very important that all those people be questioned, because the position of profit does not prove in those papers
 isliye court or chunaav ayog ke saamne kai baaten saaf hona jaruri he
 We want to prove ourselves innocent before the Commission but the Commission is in a hurry
 isse pehle march main dilli hoicourt ne20 vidhayakon kii sadsytako radd karne ke ayog ke faisle ko radd kar diya tha
 The High Court had at that time directed the Commission to give all these mlas an opportunity to repeat their case in the Office of Profit
 uske baad se hi ayog is maamle kii lagaataar sunwaayee kar rahaa he jisamen aam aadmi party ke 20 vidhayak kuch or gavaahon kaa cross ejamination is maamle main chunaav ayog ke saamne karana chaahate hai

 uttar pradesh keribarelimen mangalvaar subah new farkka express kii nau bogiyaan patari se utar gayi
 a total of 6 people have died in the accident
 haalanki, kya ye haadasa hi he yaa phir iske peeche koi sajeesh he is par sawaal uth rahe hai
 Because immediately after the accident, the anti-terrorism Squad team of Uttar Pradesh is reaching the spot for investigation
 yahi kaaran he ki ghatana ke baad sajeesh jaise sawaal saamne aa rahe hai
 Actually, at the place where this accident happened, the tracks are seen broken
 jisaki vajah se haadasa itnaa bada ho gaya
 Now UP ATS is reaching the spot to explore these aspects
 haalanki, vahaan maujuud police adhikari abhi aisa bayaan dene se batch rahe hai
 He says that at first sight it seems to be a case of accident
 bataa den ki ye pehali baar nahin he jab uttar pradesh main kisi rail haadase main sajeesh kaa shaq hua ho
 Earlier, the ATS had also reached for investigation in the Muzaffarnagar rail accident that occurred last year
 tab aties haadase main teror angel ko khoj rahi thi
 However, nothing came out in the investigation
 sirf upi hi nahin balki pichley saal hi bihar main aatankiyon ne patari par IED rakh diya tha, jiske kaaran aties kaa shaq gaharaaya tha
 What was the Muzaffarnagar accident? In August 2017, the Kalinga Utkal Express train going from Puri to Haridwar derailed near Khatauli railway station in Muzaffarnagar
 train ke 14 dibbe patari se utarkar agal-bagal ke gharon or ek skool main ghus gaye
 23 people died in this accident
 gauratlab he ki aties team kaa kaam kisi bhi ghatana main us pahalu ko khojna he jo ise kisi aatanki ghatana se jodta he
 If some terrorist activity is found in the accident then ATS takes action on it

 Film director Mehboob Khan was born on September 9, 1907 in the city of Bilimoda, Gujarat
 apni adbhut kala ke madhyam se unhone bhartiya cinema kaa parichay videsh se karavaaya
 Who can forget the film Mother India
 is film ne auskar tak kaa safar tay kiya
 The film failed to take the award, but the film definitely showed a new direction to Indian cinema
 28 may, 1964 ko 56 varsh kii umr main mehboob khan kaa nidhan ho gaya tha
 Know some stories related to the life of Mehboob Khan on his death anniversary
 film nirdeshak mehboob khan ne 30 saal ke kariyar main kul 24 filmon kaa nirdesan kiya tha
 Mother India was the most discussed among them
 iske alaava vatan, aurat, bahan, takadir, anmol ghadi, andaaj, aan or amar jaisi behtareen filmein banaai
 His films had a special inclination towards respect for women
 bahut kam log ye jaanate honge ki mehboob khan ko nirdeshak nahin balki ek actor banane kaa shauk tha
 At the age of 16, he escaped from home and came to Mumbai to act
 magar jab unke pita ko is bare main pataa chalaa ve mehboob ko waapas ghar le aae
 But his dream of becoming an actor was still in his mind
 samay bitta gaya
 When Mehboob was 23 years old, he came to Mumbai with a film industry expert and started working in the Tabelle to put horseshoes
 mehboob khan ke filmon main nirdesan kii shuruyaat bhi ittefaq se hui
 Actually once Mehboob Khan entered the shooting set of a South film
 film kaa nirdesan chandrashekhar kar rahe the
 Mehboob expressed his desire to work together, upon which he also got the consent of the director
 magar role bahut chota mila
 After this, he gradually got supporting roles
 ye baat us daur kii he jab industry main silent filmein chalati thim
 Very few people would know that when the first speaking film in India was being made Alam Ara, then the director of the film Ardeshir Irani had cast Mahboob Khan first for his lead role
 magar baat kuch khaas bani nahin
 Many people told Ardeshir that it is not right to do too much experiment in the first film
 iske baad film main role actor vitthal ne play kiya

 See, the entire score of the match has reached the top of the points table beating the Cordchennai Super Kings Rajasthan Royals
 iske saath hi siesake ne plaof main bhi apni jagah bana lee he
 Super Kings, however, did not have a good start

 In the very next over, Suresh Raina (3) also returned to the pavilion
 kris moris ne raina ko foconor ke haathon kaich out karavaaya
 After losing two wickets for 17 from four overs, the Super Kings were seen in trouble, with Brendon mcclam (81) and Fof du Plessis (29) sharing the team for 101 runs for the third wicket
 haalanki sanbhalkar khilne ke prayaas main ve ran gati ko zyada nahin badha sake
 Plessis returned to the pavilion unfortunate in the second ball of the 17th over
 shen watasan ne apane hi over main plasis ko ran out kiya
 Plessis faced 25 balls with three fours
 plasis ke jane ke baad maiklam bhi zyada der nahin tik sake or kris moris ne 18wein over kii duusari gend par maiklam kii nayab pari par viraam laga diya

 raashtrapati ramnath kovind ne unki patni mahjabeen ko yah sammaan saunpa
 This is the first time that a soldier who has been recruited in the army after leaving the path of terror was awarded such a huge honor of the army
 beete saal november main nazeer vaani shopiyaan main aatankiyon se ladate hue shahid ho gaye the
 He was shot during that encounter
 iske baavjood unhone kai aatankiyon ko maar giraaya tha
 It is said that due to Nazir Wani, the army carried out many successful operations against the terrorists
 unhone apni bahaduree or jambaaji ke vajah se bahut jald apni unit main alag pahchaan bana lee thi
 His officers also did not get tired of praising his work
 bataaya jaataa he ki sena main aane se pehle nazeer vaani kabhi 'ikhwaan' ke sadsy the
 It was an organization of such Kashmiris, who were earlier terrorists
 lekin baad main bhartiya sena ke saath milakar aatankiyon kaa khaatmaa karne lage
 Actually, the people associated with 'ikhwan' were a neglected terrorist organization of Pakistan's intelligence agency ISI
 jo baad main hijbul mujahidin jaise sanghathan se judaa
 But there too people associated with ‘ikhwan’ were marginalized
 iske baad is sanghathan ne bhartiya sena kaa saath dena shuru kar diya
 But Ikhwan's worst days came in 1996
 kashmir ke aam log ikhwaan ko naapsand karte the duusari ore islamic sanghathanon ke nishane par bhi the
 But at one time, the government stopped supporting him
 sarkari sangrakshan khatm ho jane par aatankwaadiyon ne ikhwaan ke sadasyon ko nishaanaa bananaa shuru kar diya
 After this, the members of Ikhwan again adopted the rebel attitude
 nazeer vaani bhi ikhwaan ke sadsy the
 But after living there for two years, he left the path of terror
 wo samaj chuke the ki bandook ke raste manzil tak nahin pahunchaa ja saktaa
 Nazir Wani surrendered to the security forces in 2004
 or kuch maah baad hi nazeer bhartiya sena main bhartee ho gaye the

 Scientists say that two out of 10 people are those whose blood pressure decreases during stress or anger
 aise main pakshaaghaat kaa hamalaa ho saktaa he or mrityu bhi ho sakati he
 According to a research at the University of California, scientists say that people usually have higher blood pressure during anger

 People who have low blood pressure are more likely to get paralyzed
 team ke pramukh vaigyanik stephen clark kaa kahana he ki gusse or tanaav main jab aap apane man ko kaabo karne kii koshish karte hai, to aapkaa raktchaap kam hone lagata he
 Sometimes it reduces so much that you become paralyzed
 lakve kaa atake zyada gambhir hone par insaan coma main ja saktaa he or isse mrityu bhi ho sakati he
 Doctor Mukesh Gupta says, someone is paralyzed only when there is very little circulation of blood in his body
 tanaav ke samay raktchaap kam hota he or agar yah sthiti zyada der tak bani rahati he, to lakva hone kii ashanka bad jaati hai
 He says, our body's nervous system is not able to function properly when the blood pressure decreases
 agar yahi sthiti zyada der tak bani rahe, to tantrika koshikaayen mrit ho jaati hai or sambhddha ang main lakva ho jaataa he

 He says, having high blood pressure is dangerous for health, but lowering it is more dangerous
 raktchaap kam ho to behosh ho janaa, sharir akad janaa to behad aam pareshaaniyaan hai
 If someone's blood pressure remains low, then he should take full care of his health
