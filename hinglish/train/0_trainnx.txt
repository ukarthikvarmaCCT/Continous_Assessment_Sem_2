 com / z0q0bdtwu5 centre kaa daawa- 90% gramin ilaake khule main shouch se mukt28 fisadi se zyada log khule main shouch karne ko majaboorbhale hi pradhanmantri narendra modi or centre sarkaar ye daawa kar rahe hai ki 90 fisadi se zyada gramin ilaake khule main shouch se mukt ho chuke hai, lekin neshnal cemple survey kii report ne in daavon ko khaarij kar diya he
 According to the National Sample Survey (NSSO) report, more than 28 percent of the people in rural areas are still forced to defecate in the open
 padhie madhya pradesh ke sihor se 'ajtak' kii ye ground report
 On 2 October 2019, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced on the banks of the Sabarmati river that India has become completely free from open defecation, but only one and a half months after the Prime Minister's announcement, India claimed to be free from open defecation
 The report of the National Sample Survey Organization is telling a different story
 neshnal cemple survey kii tazaa report ke mutabik 71
 3 per cent rural households and 96
 2 fisadi shahari gharon main shauchalay he
 But Prime Minister Narendra Modi has claimed that India has become free from open defecation
 aise main sawaal uthta he ki gramin bharat main baaki ke 28
 7 Where the percentage of people go for toilet yahaan subah kii pehali kiran nikalate hi kai log bhi khule main shouch ke liye apane gharon se baahar nikal padate hai
 Women or men from the village go to the open defecation in the morning
 gaanv ke paas se guzar rahi railway line ke kinare kii jhaadiyon main gaanv ke log subah shouch ke liye badi sankhya main jate hai
 Narayani Bai, who hails from the same village, said that her house does not have toilets, so her entire family goes out for forced defecation
 narayani bai ne bataaya ki shauchalay kaa kaam abhi chal rahaa he jo kishtein puri milte hi ban jayega
 The Aajtak team reached Thunakhurd village in Sehore district after the money was not received from the panchayat to build toilets
 yahaan bhi kai log dikhaai die jo khule main shouch ke liye yaa to ja rahe the yaa aa rahe the
 When Mangilal, resident of the same village, was coming to the toilet, you would be surprised to hear what he told
 maangilaal ne dikhaaya ki ghar main shauchalay kaa gaddha khuda hua he, lekin panchayat se shauchalay banavaane ke paise jari nahin hue
 Therefore, one has to go for open defecation
 maangilaal aki tarah mazdooree karne vaale nandakishor ke ghar main bhi shauchalay nahin he
 The government may make a million claims, but this ground report proves that a large number of people are still going to open defecation in rural areas

 The comments afridi ne kaha, 'mujhe nahin lagata ki hamen bharat se khilne ko itnaa adhik mahatv dene kii jarurat he

 Neither human nature has ever changed, nor will it change, and the wrongdoers find a way to keep doing the wrong thing, so the demonetisation step taken by the Government of India to get rid of the shadow of corruption, black money and terrorism Nothing will be achieved
 yah kahana he vishwaprasiddh patrika 'forbs' ke chairman or editor-in-chif steve forbs kaa
 He has written in his editorial that human spirit has not changed since the planet was inhabited
 galat kaam karne vaale koi na koi rasta nikaal hi lete hai
 Terrorists will not stop their evil acts simply because of changing the currency, and digitization of money is going to take a long time, in the event that free market is allowed
 steve forbs ke mutabik tex chori se bachane kaa sabase aasaan upaay ekasmaan tex dar, yaa kam se kam ek saral or kam dar vaali tex pranali lagu karnaa hota he, jiske baad tex chori karnaa hi vyarth lagane lage
 According to Steve, if law makes it easier to do business, then most people will do the right business

 Many countries are moving towards the closure of large amount of notes, and are giving the same arguments as the Government of India has given, but there should be no mistake in understanding what its real purpose is - your privacy
 Attacking and imposing maximum control of the government on your life
 tippaniyan According to Steve Forbes, this gross act of the Indian government is also immoral, because currency is something that represents the things people make
 mudra bilkul vaisaa hi vaada hoti he, jaisaa koi cinema yaa kaarykram main shaamil tikat hoti he, jo aapako seat milane kii guarantee detii he
 Such resources produce people, not governments

 or isse bhi koi hairaani nahin hoti ki sarkaar is sachai ko chipa rahi he ki is ek kadam se ek hi jatke main dasiyon arab dollar kaa nuksaan hone ja rahaa he
 Now the work that India must do to become a global powerhouse is to reduce the income and business tax rates, and simplify the entire tax structure, make the rupee a currency as powerful as Swiss franc, and reduce the rules To reduce the cost, so that new business can be started in a few minutes without any cost

 steve forbs ke anusaar, bharat sarkaar kaa yah ghor krity aniatik bhi he, kyonki mudra vah vastu he, jo logon dwaara banaai gai vastuon kaa pratinidhitiv karti he
 The currency is exactly the same as a ticket to a cinema or event, which guarantees you a seat
 is tarah ke sansaadhan sarkarein nahin, log paidaa karte hai
 What India has done is a massive theft of people's property, which is more shocking because of the democratically elected government
 aisa kuch venezuela jaise desh main hota, to shaayad itani hairaani nahin hoti
 And it is no surprise that the government is hiding the truth that this one step is going to cause a loss of tens of billions of dollars in one stroke
 ab bharat ko global powerhouse banane ke liye jo kaam nishchit rup se karnaa chahie, vah he inkam tathaa bijnes tex kii daron ko gata de, or samooche tex dhaanche kaa sarleekaran kare, rupee ko swiss frank jitani shaktishaalee mudra bana de, or niyamon ko kam se kam kar de, taaki bina kisi laagat ke bhi kuch hi minuton main nayaa vyapaar shuru kiya ja sake
 Now the work that India must do to become a global powerhouse is to reduce the income and business tax rates, and simplify the entire tax structure, make the rupee a currency as powerful as Swiss franc, and reduce the rules To reduce the cost, so that new business can be started in a few minutes without any cost

 bhartiya cricket team ke captain mahendra singh dhoni kii tarif saathi khilaadiyon se to aap kai baar sun chuke honge, lekin coach dancan flechar ke munh se shaayad hi kabhi suni hogi
 Fletcher BCCI
 tv ko die intervyuu main dhoni ko 'bahut eemaandaar' or 'ziddee' captain bataaya he
 Fletcher said of Dhoni, 'he leads the team like a leader
 jab wo dabaav main ballebaaji karne aata he to wo bahut hi behtareen hota he
 He first appears on such occasions and says that i am going to do this
 ab tum logon ko bas ise aage badhanaa he
 i have seen many captains who are good leaders in the right circumstances
 lekin mushkil paristhitiyon main jis tarah se dhoni ladate hai, wo behtareen hota he
 Regarding his first meeting with Dhoni, Fletcher said, "dhoni is a man with whom one can easily get along
 main usase pehali baar tab mila tha jab westeindies siries ke liye mujhe mumbai main team se judana tha
 I'm lucky that i got such a captain
 dhoni kabhi bhi kisi ke bare main pehle se koi dharna nahin banaata or baatcheet karne ke baad hi kisi ke bare main koi raay banaata he
 During Fletcher's tenure, Team India has had to go through difficult times
 iske bare main flechar ne bataaya, 'haar ke samay bhi hamaare relation main koi fark nahin aayaa tha
 When you go through a bad phase, you see the real face of a human being
 dhoni aisa captain he jo jeet ke samay zyada utsahit nahin hota or dabaav main bahut shant rahata he, jo bahut jaruri bhi he
 Fletcher said, "dhoni is a very stubborn captain and it is very difficult to change his opinion
 mujhe isamen koi buraai najar nahin aati
 i think a captain should be like this
 ek acha captain galat faislon se zyada ziddee hi sahi par behtareen faisle letaa he

 Many veteran leaders of the world have known the meaning of this saying, even if they are not familiar with its Chinese origin
 shi jinping, jinke bhaashan chini clasik or lok kathaon ke uddharanon se bhare hote hai, ise jaanate hai
 Vladimir Putin of Russia, Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey and Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia are also born
 nishchit rup se pradhanmantri modi bhi yah jaanate honge
 His three terms as Chief Minister of Gujarat and the first term of South Block are enough for this
 jo bhi ho, unke duusare kaarykaal ke pehle pakhwaade main kuch anhoni hui he
 Yesterday morning news came that the Prime Minister had constituted two important cabinet committees - one for investment and economic growth and the other for employment and skill development
 is faisle kaa sabhi ore swaagat kiya gaya
 Ultimately, this meant that the Modi government was quick to accept what Congress had said during the election campaign - that the economy is in the grip of recession (GDP growth in the last quarter was one percent from the 2019 forecast
 Falling down over 5
 8% par aa gai he) or berogari ab tak ke sabase ucch str par pahunch gai he (shram mantralay ne aakhirkaar sweekaar kiya ki berogari pichley 45 saal main sabase ucch str par he)
 However, there was something unusual in the political signal given through this announcement
 modi sarkaar ke nae grih mantri amit shah donon cametiyon main shaamil kiye gaye, bhale hi unke grih mantralay ke portpholio kaa arthvyavastha se judi do panelon se koi sidhaa sambandh nahin he
 On the other hand, the name of Rajnath Singh sent from the Ministry of Home Affairs to the Ministry of Defense was missing in both these committees
 rajnath singh ke naam kaa ek or mahatvapurn samiti main chhotna kahin adhik chaunkaane vaala tha- raajnneetik maamalon kii cabinet samiti, jo ki cabinet kii suraksha samiti ke baad sarkaar ke samgr kaamkaaj ko lekar sabase mahatvapurn he
 As defense minister, he naturally found a place in the Cabinet Committee on Security, according to the prevailing system, the Home Minister is also in it
 lekin nae cabinet panelon ke swaroop se saaf pataa chal rahaa he ki shah ne unase unki 'limlite' chura lee he
 Now Shah's authority will be seen in both the political and economic spheres of Modi's 'new India'
 yah bhi tay he ki bijepi adhyaksh pad se hatane ke baad bhi party ke maamalon main modi ke baad duusare number par unka dabadabaa kaayam rahegaa
 Defense Minister Rajnath Singh was earlier named in only two cabinet committees, later added to several other committees
 desh main achaanak raajnneetik or media halkon main atakalon kaa daur shuru ho gaya: kya iskaa yah matlab he ki midi 2
 Rajnath Singh demoted in 0? Does this also mean that Amit Shah has actually been 'anointed' as number two in the new Modi government, ignoring the fact that Rajnath Singh was sworn in after the Prime Minister at Rashtrapati Bhavan on May 30 Thi? Conjecture is a corrosive agent in any organization, which is most commonly seen at the top level of government
 yah bheetar andeh, baahar bhram paidaa karata he
 It gives rise to whisper when new ideas and imaginations join the path and quickly becomes viral on a large scale
 yahi kaaran he ki koi bhi sarvocch netaa anumaanon or afvaahon ke janm or unke prasar kii ijaajat nahin detaa he
 One of the commendable aspects of Modi's first term was that there was no scope for any speculation about the cohesion of his power structure
 unki ekmaatr aawaaj thi jo ki myne rakhti thi
 There was never any discussion as to who is number two in his government, as there was no number two
 kya ab modi sarkaar ke kaamkaaj kii style main badlaav hone vaala he? yah bataanaa jaldbaaji hogi
 However, early indications are that some things - perhaps, some very important things - may change in the next five years
 nai team modi main amit shah vyapak rup se vaais capten ke rup main najar aaenge, jis tarah ve chunaav abhiyaan ke dauraan vastav main nirvivaad rup se modi ke 'dipti' the
 Not only within the Sangh Parivar, but also his critics (who hate his aggressive communal politics) have humbly acknowledged Shah's huge contribution to the bjp's victory in the elections
 enditivi par ek panel discshan main janata dal (united) ke ek chatur netaa pawan verma ne suzav diya ki modi ko shah ko up pradhanmantri ke rup main niyukt karnaa chahie
 Speculation has already begun that Shah may become Modi's successor in 2024, something that is also indicated by his body language and the media's attitude towards him
 raashtrapati bhawan main shapath grahan samaaroh main amit shah, piem narendra modi or rajnath singh
 The real question is whether Modi and Shah can refuse to accept the Chinese saying that "one mountain can be Tigers"
 " ho saktaa he ki modi khud jaanboojhkar shah ko apane bharosemand dipti ke rup main taiyaar kar rahe hon
 It is also possible that Modi wants to leave the worldly aspects of governance and political management to his old confidants and focus his energies on some strategic goals
 tathyon or vishwasaneey sanketon ke abhaav main yah anumaan lagane kaa koi matlab nahin he ki modi 2
 0 how to proceed
 haalanki, ek tathy hamaare saamne he
 Apart from the restructuring of some old committees, the Modi government has been unnaturally shocked by the formation of two new cabinet committees
 da indian express ne aaj apane binar hedline main ise acchhee tarah se vyakt kiya he - "all in a day's work: Morning order omits Rajnath from key panels, he's in by night"
 The country does not know exactly what happened between morning and night, but the government changed its notification and included the defense minister in four cabinet committees
 is prakaar, suraksha or aarthik maamalon kii samitiyon ke alaava rajnath singh ab raajnneetik maamalon, sansadeey maamalon, nivesh or vikaas, or rojgaar or kaushal vikaas kii samitiyon ke sadsy ban gaye hai
 Now, let's look at the opposite

 com / tetr4frgc7 arvind kejariwal ke saamne hi aam aadmi party ke ek vidhayak ne 30 april kii raat ko kumaar vishwaas ko phone lagaaya
 Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal himself listened, believing that he was ready to take over as party chief
 unhone kaha ki unke saath tab mantri rahe kapil mishra or 33 anya vidhayak bhi hai
 This number is more than half of the total mlas of the party
 vishwaas ne kaha ki kejariwal kii jagah vah aap ke pramukh honge
 The 48-year-old Chief Minister of Delhi was now aware that the rumors of Kumar Vishwas taking advantage of the situation going on in the party, especially after the defeat in MCD elections in Delhi, were not unfounded
 aap ke sutron se mili jaankaree ke anusaar aise kuch hone kii baat ko abhi tak naa to mukhyamantri ne or naa hi unke karyaalay ne nakaara he
 According to sources, the party may soon issue a statement in this matter
 kejariwal ne kapil mishra ko is ghatana ke saat din baad mantri pad se hataa diya
 But he did not take any action against Kumar Vishwas as he is said to have a very old family relationship and did not want to be seen as a sacking of a famous leader
 saal 2015 main party ke sansthaapak sadasyon prashanth bhushan or yogendra yadav ke party se nikaale jane kii ghatana aaj bhi party ke liye kadavi yaadon kii tarah he
 So despite several party leaders insisting on the removal of Kumar Vishwas, the Chief Minister negotiated an agreement that included making Kumar Vishwas the head of the Rajasthan unit of the party
 tippaniyan a senior official of Kapil Mishra's office confirmed that he had held a meeting with mlas who were in support of the coup plan in the party, along with Kumar Vishwas
 lekin jab kejariwal ne vidroh ko dabaane ke liye ranneetik rup se kadam badaye to jald hi un logon ne apana rukh thik kar liya
 Sources in the party said that they were confident that the BJP was encouraging Vishwas to take steps against Kejriwal
 gauratlab he ki pichley maheene hi bijepi ne emsidi chunaavon main baari jeet hasil kii thi or jo lagaataar mukhyamantri kejariwal se ulajhati rahati he
 Kumar Vishwas has on several occasions denied any connection with the BJP
 lekin kejariwal ko hataane ke liye tay kii gai baithak se thik pehle aap ke vidhayak amanatulla khan ne saarvajanik rup se aropal laga diya ki vishwaas bijepi kii shah par party ko todna chaahate hai
 Vishwas termed it as a tactic to tarnish his image and demanded punitive action against Amanatullah
 tab kejariwal ke saath hue samjhaute ke anusaar amanatulla khan ko party ke vibhinn padon se hataa diya gaya, lekin saath hi kejariwal ke prati vafadari ke evaj main kshatipurti ke rup main unhen dilli vidhansabha ke kai cametiyon main shaamil kar liya gaya

 Kejriwal removed Kapil Mishra from the post of minister seven days after the incident
 lekin unhone kumaar vishwaas ke khilaaf koi karrwai nahin kii kyonki kaha jaataa he ki donon ke bich kaaphi puraane paariwarik rishte hai or vah ek prasiddh netaa ko barkhaast karne vaale ke rup main nahin dikhnaa chaahate the
 The incident of the removal of the founding party members Prashant Bhushan and Yogendra Yadav from the party in 2015 is still a bitter memory for the party
 isliye party ke kai pramukh netaaon dwaara kumaar vishwaas ko hataae jane par jor dene ke baavjood mukhyamantri ne ek samjhaute par baatcheet kii jisamen kumaar vishwaas ko party kii rajasthan ikai kaa pramukh banaaya janaa bhi shaamil tha
 The comments kapil mishra ke karyaalay ke ek varisht adhikari ne is baat kii pushti kii ki kumaar vishwaas ke saath milakar unhone un vidhayakon ke saath ek baithak kii thi jo party main takhtapalat kii yojana ke samarthan main the
 But when Kejriwal took strategic steps to suppress the rebellion, they soon corrected their stand
 party ke sutron ne kaha ki unhen puraa yakeen tha ki vishwaas ko kejariwal ke khilaaf kadam uthaane ke liye bijepi protsaahit kar rahi thi
 Significantly, only last month, BJP had won a landslide victory in MCD elections and which is constantly entangled with Chief Minister Kejriwal
 kumaar vishwaas kai maukon par bijepi se kisi bhi tarah kaa sambandh hone se inkaar kar chuke hai
 But just before the meeting scheduled to remove Kejriwal, AAP MLA Amanatullah Khan publicly alleged that Vishwas wanted to break up the party at the instigation of the BJP
 vishwaas ne ise apni chhavi kharaab karne kaa hatkandaa bataaya or amanatulla ke khilaaf dandatmak karrwai kii maang kii
 According to the agreement reached with Kejriwal, Amanatullah Khan was removed from various party posts, but was also included in several committees of the Delhi Legislative Assembly as a compensation for his loyalty to Kejriwal

 At the beginning of his batting, Pujara is a bit lethargic and does not play fully ahead
 hamane australia daure main unki ballebaaji dekhi thi
 'sarvate said that our plan was not to allow him to use his feet at the start of the innings

 Sarvate said, 'we had to take an aggressive stance
 chaay ke vishram main 10 minute bache the, isliye hamane forward short leg lagaaya
 The ball was taking a turn, so keep fielders in silly point and slip so that pressure could be applied on them and this scheme worked
 pujaara ne tab krij par kadam rakhaa, jab saurashtra kaa score do wicket par 79 ran tha
 Vidarbha put three close fielders for them and bowled their two main bowlers Umesh Yadav and Sarvate
 pujaara ne umesh kii keval ek gend kaa saamana kiya or us par ek ran bhi banaaya, lekin vah sarvate the, jinhone australian gendbaajon kii naak main dam karne vaale is ballebaaj ko pareshaan kiya
 Pujara played Sarvate's ten balls, not scoring a single run on him
 sarvate kii ek gend jald hi unke balle kaa kinaaraa lekar slip main jafar ke surakshit haathon main chali gai
 Sarwate took three wickets for Vidarbha on Monday, leaving Saurashtra at 158 for five by the end of the second day's play

 international cricket main ranon or shatakon kii jhadi lagane vaale team india ke captain viraat kohli ke liye 2018 behad shandaar saal rahaa he
 Now the challenges of the new 2019 await them
 maujuuda daur main duniya ke sarvshereshth khilaadiyon main shumaar kohli ko ballebaaj ke taur par hi nahin, captain ke taur par bhi is saal agnipariksha se guzarana hoga
 There is a big chance for them to prove their superiority
 2019 main viraat kohli ke saamne sabase badi chunauti he england main hone vaala 50 overon kaa cricket world cap
 The litmus test of Kohli's captaincy will be in this tournament
 2019 world cap hi kohli kii captaini kii dasha or disha tay kar saktaa he
 Kohli will have a chance to join Kapil Dev and Mahendra Singh Dhoni's club
 1983 main bharat ko kapil dev ne pehali baar world cap jitayaa tha
 Just 28 years after that, Mahendra Singh Dhoni made India the 2011 World Champion
 ab 8 saal baad viraat kohli par bharat ko teesraa world cap kaa khitaab jitaane kaa jimmaa he
 Virat Kohli and Mahendra Singh Dhoni's captaincy style is different
 viraat, dhoni kii tarah kamyaabi ke nae kirtiman banaaenge or team india ko sawaalon ke daur se aage le ja sakenge, ise lekar sabaki dilchaspee bani hui he
 Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Virat Kohli are two different personalities as captain
 ek ne team india ko aitihaasik kamyaabiyaan dilaai hai, to ek kal kii ummiido kaa nayak he
 One has a long list of titles, so one has high hopes for titles
 viraat kohli apane aakraamak tevar ke liye jane jate hai
 Be it batting or captaincy, Virat Kohli maintains his stance
 vah aakraamak hai or apni bhavanaaen chhipate nahin
 Captain Kohli, who made the U-19 team the World Champion in 2008, has come as the biggest stop and chance of his career, which he would have dreamed of
 world cap kaa england main hona viraat kohli ke liye adwantage ho saktaa he, kyonki do saal pehle kohli isi dharti par world cap kii dress reharsal kar chuke hai
 In 2017, Kohli led India to the final of the tournament in the Mini World Cup i
e
 Champions Trophy played in England
 lekin, is baar phens ko ummid hogi ki bharat ko champions trophy 2017 upavijeta banane vaale kohli is baar bhartiya team ko world cap jitwa den
 This year the World Cup in England will be played from 30 May to 14 July
 is dauraan vahaan kaaphi garmi hogi, jisase england ke halaat bharat ko raas aaenge
 In such a situation, the Virat Brigade will have a good chance
 bhartiya team kaaphi santulit najar aa rahi he, lekin uske saamne world cap main mejabaan england, australia, south africa or pakistan jaisi tiimon kii chunauti hogi
 If Virat's army manages to replicate what was done in the Champions Trophy two years ago, nothing can stop India from winning the World Cup
 bhartiya team ke paas captain viraat kohli samet rohit sharma, mahendra singh dhoni, hardik pandya, shikhar dhawan, kuldeep yadav or jasprit bumraah jaise star khilaadi he
 In such a situation, his balance will be heavy on the rest of the teams
 world cap ke itihaas main record 5 baar khitaab australia ne jeeta he
 After Australia, when it comes to the successful teams of the World Cup, it includes India and West Indies jointly with 2–2 titles
 bharat agar 2019 kaa world cap jeet letaa he, to vah teen khitaab ke saath australia ke baad duusari sabase kaamyaab team ban jayega

 vah sangeet kii duniya main bada naam hai
 He has sung many film songs and bhajans in his career
 holi, diwaali, durga puja ho yaa chhath puja unki madhur or sukun bhari gayikee ne har kisi kaa dil jeeta he
 But very few people would know that he had said goodbye to playbackshing at the peak of his career
 unke janmdin par jaaniye unke jivan se jude kuch kisse
 Talking about the early times, Anuradha's childhood was spent in Mumbai, due to which her tendency was towards films from the beginning
 unhone amitabh or jaya bachchan kii film 'abhimaan' se apane singig kariyar kii shuruyaat kii thi
 In which he sang a verse for Jaya
 iske baad saal 1976 main film 'kaalicharan' main anuraadhaa ne gaanaa gaaya
 But he started singing solo with the film 'aap Biti'
 is film kaa sangeet lakshmikant-pyarelal ne diya tha
 An interesting thing about Anuradha is that she has done around 300 stage shows with Kishore Kumar
 vah unhen apane pita ke samaan maanati thim
 She still considers Kishore Kumar her role model
 bataa den ki anuraadhaa jab kariyar kii top par thim to unka naam lata mangeshkar or aashaa bhosle jaisi singrs ke saath liya jaataa tha
 It was also believed that if there is any replacement of Lata Mangeshkar, then she is Anuradha
 magar jis daur main anuraadhaa ke bare main aisi baaten hoti thim us daur main unhone filmon main gaanaa hi chhod diya tha
 The reason for leaving the film industry was that in an interview, he said, "I had decided to quit playback singing before the film Aashiqui and Dil Hai Ke Mata Nahin
" lekin phir maine sochaa ki jab main apane kariyar ke shikhar par hongi tab filmon main gaanaa chhoduungi

 After the first demonetisation and now the introduction of GST, there is an atmosphere of concern among traders in many markets of the country
 dilli ke dil main based karol baag ke 'mini china market' ke naam se jane jane vaale gaffaar market main bhi jiesti aane ke baad sannata pasra hua he
 Work has come to a standstill in most shops
 gaffaar market main chini mobile phone or duusare electronic saamaan kii bikri sabase zyada hoti he
 Most shopkeepers say that after GST, business has slowed down
 vahiin kai dukandaar modi sarkaar ke is kadam ke saath hai
 Mahendra Chopra, who sells wireless phones in Gaffmarket, said in a conversation with Aaj Tak, "we mostly send goods with bills, but there are no buyers in the market at this time
 unako pataa nahin he ki jiesti kya he? graahak bazaar main nahin he
 The purchase is still pending
 haalanki inke bagal main hi kalculator kii dukaan chalaane vaale modi sarkaar ke saath khadey hai or jiesti kaa samarthan karte hai
 They say that a very good job has been done
 koi galat kaam nahin hua he
 We are very happy
 isse koi nuksaan nahin he
 Everyone benefits from GST
 gaffaar market main mobile kii dukaan chalaane vaale raman thakur ne kaha, 'jo hamaari sarkaar ne faisla liya he
 He is thoughtful and the Modi government is indeed much better than the earlier government
 jo faisla le rahe hai, vah bahut acha le rahe hai or desh ke hit main he
 Thakur said that in this we should support
 kaamkaaj par abhi tak koi asar nahin padaa he
 When VAT came, at that time there was an uproar
 notebandi main bhi hangaamaa hua tha
 Then the work will be done in a few days as it was
 vakt ke saath sab kuch thik ho jayega
 Although there are many traders who are really upset with GST and their problems are also valid
 in vyapaariyon kaa kahana he ki abhi tak jiesti kaa naa hi number mila he or naa hi jiesti kii website thik se kaam kar rahi he
 Due to this, the horse trading is completely stalled
 mobile or duusare electronic saamaan bechney vaale charanjit ne jiesti vyapaariyon ke kaamkaaj par hone vaale asar par baat karte hue kaha ki abhi to bahut fark padegaa or kaam dhandhe par pehle hi fark pad chukaa he
 The work is done
 kaam kuch bhi nahin he
 Let's see how it goes next? We have a problem that goods are not coming from behind
 aise main maal kaise kharidenge? kai vyapaariyon ko yah nahin pataa he ki jiesti lagu kaise hoga or uske tahat bikri or kharid kaise kii jaaegi?charanjit kehete hai ki jiesti ke bare main pataa nahin he ki kaise lagu hoga? hamen iske bare main kuch bhi nahin pataa he or kaise hamaara saamaan aayega? baad main dekhenge ki kaise bechnaa he
 Customers who are coming now are confused how to buy goods? Our GST Number has not arrived yet
 abhi tak proscisger main he
 So, we are not able to sell some goods yet
 jab se jiesti lagu hua he, hamane 2000 rupee kaa bhi maal nahin bechaa he
 Yogesh Kumar, executive member of the Ghaffar Market Traders Association, shared the pain of traders after GST in an interview with Aaj Tak
 yogesh ne kaha ki notebandi ke baad se bazaar main pehle se hi thodi susti he
 The buying power of the customers is reduced
 jiesti ko lekar abhi tak bahut chizon par spashtikaran nahin he
 However, many businessmen consider GST to be the biggest reform of this century
 yogesh kumaar ne kaha, 'yah sadi kaa sabase bada rifarm he
 Modi's thinking is far-sighted, but a lot of things are not clear to traders right now
 shaayad uske kaaran vyapaaree abhi tak bahut sari chizon ko samaj nahin paa rahe hai
 i believe that in the coming days some things will be cleared and traders will understand easily
 asamanjas kii sthiti abhi bani padi he
 There will be lightness in the business for a few days
 desh ke vyapaaree notebandi ke asar se abhi tak jujh rahe hai or aise main jiesti ke lagu hone se vyapaariyon main asamanjas kaa maahaul he
 Such confusion is directly affecting their business

 parali vidhansabha main pankaja ko chachere bhai dhananjay munde se maat millidananjay munde ko 121186 vot, pankaja munde ko 90418 vot milimaharashtra vidhansabha chunaav main bhartiya janata party sabase badi party ke taur par ubharkar saamne ai he
 At the same time, many BJP veterans have also lost in the state
 sarkaar main mantri pankaja munde apane garh parali se chunaav haar gai hai
 Pankaja is defeated by his cousin Dhananjay Munde
 maharashtra vidhansabha main netaa vipaksh dhananjay munde ne apni bahan ko lagbhag 3 xxrep 4 0 voton se shikast de di
 While Dhananjay Munde got 121186 votes, Pankaja Munde got only 90418 votes
 bataa den ki chunaav prachaar ke dauraan pankaja munde ke samarthan main prachaar karne ke liye na sirf grih mantri or bijepi adhyaksh amit shah aae the balki bijepi ke firebrands netaa or pradhanmantri narendra modi ne bhi parali main sabha sambodhit kii thi
 In the election campaign, Churchpankaja Munde from 370 to Pakistan had tried to make Gopinath Munde's legacy, as well as Article 370, triple talaq and Pakistan a big issue in this area
 pankaja munde ne chunaav prachaar ke dauraan kaha ki maharashtra rashtriya muddon or raashtra se alag nahin he
 In such a situation, why should elections not be held on national issues
 lekin shaayad parali vidhansabha ke log sthaneey muddon ko lekar zyada gambhir the
 What do the locals say? There was a lot of resentment against Pankaja Munde at the local level
 parali ke rahane vaale guru prasad kaa kahana he ki gopinath munde kii vajah se do baar pankaja munde ko chunaav main mauka diya lekin unhone kshetra ko apana nahin samajha
 Seeing the road of Pankaja Munde's ancestral village, one cannot believe that it is the ancestral village of a minister
 marathavada main pani kii killat se puraa desh waakif he lekin ise dur karne ke liye bhi pankaja munde dwaara koi thos kadam nahin uthaaya gaya
 Dhananjay Munde kept the view, though locals believe that when the drought occurred last year, Dhananjay Munde, who took command of the city council, provided water through tankers
 parali ke rahane vaale raju kaa kahana he ki chunaav main aap chahen jin muddon par charchaa kar lo hamaare kaam to sthaneey netaa hi aayega
 bjp's nationalist pieces on the electoral board of Maharashtra could not succeed as much as the BJP had hoped
 sthaneey moharon ne rashtriya muddon ko patkhni de di
 This is the reason why two-time mla's influence in the election, the domination of a minister in the state government and the support of the legacy of a strong leader of the state could not save Pankaja Munde

 The South Korean team looked pretty battered in the first half
 pehle half tak algeria kii team korea par 3-0 kii badhat bana chuki thi

 korian team der se rangath main lauti, jiskaa antim nattejey par koi asar nahin padaa
 The South Korean team held the ball for 54 percent of the time during the match, while the Algerian team held the ball for the remaining 46 percent of the time

 korea ne 13 baar foul kiye, jabaki algeria ne 16 baar
 Overall, the audience thoroughly enjoyed the South Korea vs Algeria match amid the rain of goals

 Ex-servicemen sitting on a dharna at Jantar Mantar, just a little away from the Red Fort, saw the pm's speech on a large TV screen

 With the support of regional parties and the Congress, Deve Gowda was the Prime Minister from June 1, 1996 to April 21, 1997, but later the Congress withdrew support, which led to Deve Gowda leaving the post

 The round of speculation that has been going on for several days about the sharing of seats in the Grand Alliance in Bihar for the Lok Sabha elections came to an end on Friday
 rashtriya janata dal (argedy) netaa or rajyasabha saansad manoj jha ne argedy pradesh adhyaksh ramchandra purve ke saath milakar press conference kii or siton ke bantwaare kaa elaan kiya
 While announcing the Mahagathbandhan seats in the press conference, Purve said that RJD will contest 20, Congress 9 and RLSP 5 seats in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections
 saath hi ramchandra purve ne bataaya ki jeethanram maanjhi kii hindustani awami morcha (ham) party ko or mukesh saahani kii vikasshil insaan party (viipi) ko 3-3 siten di gai hai
 We have also got the ticket for the by-election for the Nawada seat of the assembly
 iske alaava congress ko rajyasabha kii ek seat dene kaa elaan kiya gaya he
 Not only this, Male has been given a seat from RJD quota
 haalanki, baaki kii siton se loksabhaa chunaav main maidan main utarane vaale naamon kaa elaan abhi nahin kiya gaya he
 However, it was known till morning about this press conference that the big leaders of all the parties involved in the grand alliance will attend the press conference
 iske baavjood mahagathbandhan main shaamil kisi bhi party kaa koi bada cheharaa najar nahin aayaa
 Aaj Tak was also informed on Friday morning that Tejashwi Yadav will be present in the press conference and will announce the seat-sharing
 lekin wo bhi nadaarad rahe
 Rajya Sabha MP Manoj Jha, who was present at the press conference on the question of RJD leader Tejashwi not attending the press conference, seemed to be avoiding answering the question directly
 unhone bijepi kaa sahaara lete hue kaha ki bijepi ne guuruuvaar ko siton ke bantwaare kaa elaan kiya tha or unke press conference main bhi jepi nadda maujuud the lekin koi bada netaa shaamil nahin hua
 But nobody asked this question to BJP
 purve ke mutabik navada loksabhaa seat se argedy kii vibha devi chunaav ladengi
 At the same time, we will beat the party chief Jitan Ram Manjhi Gaya in the Lok Sabha elections
 ralospa ummidavaar bhoodev choudhary jamui se chunaav ladenge
 Apart from this, Sharad Yadav will contest the election symbol of RJD
 mahagathbandhan kii taraf se siton ke elaan ke mutabik ham party se upendra prasad aurangabad se chunaav ladenge
 According to the information, before this press conference, a meeting was held at Tejashwi's house at 10 Circular Road, in which all the big leaders attended
 ralospa pramukh upendra kushvaha, ham party ke pramukh upendra kushvaha, sharad yadav, tejasvi yadav samet congress ke bade netaa bhi shaamil the
 But due to the absence of any big leader in the press conference of the Grand Alliance, many types of questions have started to arise
 sawaal isliye uth rahe hai kyonki mahagathbandhan ke sabhi dalon dwaara jitani siton kii maang kii gai he utani siten unke cote main nahin ai hai
 For the Lok Sabha elections, the Congress had asked for 11 seats in the grand alliance, but the Congress has been given only 9 seats
 saath hi rajyasabha kii ek seat dene kii baat kahi gai he
 Asked by Aaj Tak why RJD leader Manoj Jha did not attend the press conference, he replied that today only the first phase candidates were to be announced, in which no big leader was to come
 jis din puri list banegi ye bade netaa janata ke samaksh honge
 Any party has the right to change in the format and that right should not be questioned

 This is the biggest problem of Indian Railways
 jahaan pehle kii sarkarein railway network ko majboot karne ke liye 40-50 hajaar karod rupee tak kharch karti thi vahiin modi sarkaar ne pichley saal ek lakh karod rupee kaa railway bajet kaa praavdhaan kiya tha

 sinha ne bataaya ki aagaamee bajet main dabl dekar train ke saath saath railway ke sucharu rup se chalane ke liye railway board ke kaamkaaj kaa vikendrikaran karne par ahm ghoshnaa kii ja sakati he
 Manoj Sinha said that it has been seen in the past that the railway has been a soft target for terrorists

 Obama's 'beast' is one such armored vehicle

 However, since 2012, the Indian President also rides in the armored black Mercedes Benz S600 (W221) Pullman Guard

 jo visphotakon se bhari hui thi
 Then the car entered the bus and a loud explosion occurred
 is hamale main 27 sainik maare gaye or 13 ghayal ho gaye
 According to reports, Iran's dangerous terrorist group 'jaish-al-adl' has claimed responsibility for this attack
 is aatanki sanghathan ko iran main blike list kiya gaya he

 a recent research on specimens derived from 'rakhigarhi', the largest known city of the Harappan civilization, has questioned the theory of 'outsiders being Aryans'
 yah shodh pratishthit shodhpatrika ‘cell' main ‘hadappa ke ek pracheen jinsmooh main purvi-europe (stapi) yaa irani krishakon kaa diene anupasthit' sheershak se isi maheene prakashit hua
 The biggest question has arisen after the claim of Professor Vasant Shinde, its chief researcher and former vice-chancellor of Deccan College, Pune, that Arya did not come from outside
 aisi hi kai sawaalon kaa professor scindia ne vistaar se jawaab diya he
 Answer: Most of the discussion was about scientific (DNA) evidence after our research was published
 hamaare shodh main vaigyanik saakshyon ke saath-saath puratathvik sakshya bhi spasht bataate hai ki itihaas main aaryon kaa hamalaa yaa bade str par palaayan jaisaa kuch nahin hua
 People had contacts in connection with trade etc
, due to which some mixed DNA is found
 arya bahari the, yah siddhant avaigyanik or bebuniyaad he
 It is based only on estimates
 main kahana chaahoonga ki ‘afghanistan se lekar bengal or kashmir se lekar andaman-nicobar tak, puure dakshin asia' kii nasl ek he, sabhi ke purvaj ek hai
 arya-non-aryan talk started happening later due to wrong theory
 jawaab: vaigyanik sakshya hadappa sabhyataa ke patan kaa mukhya kaaran ‘paryaavaran main badlaav' bataate hai
 The environment began to dry up around 2,000 BCE
 isse sirf hadappa hi nahin balki misr or mesopotamia kii tatkaaleen sabhyataaon kaa bhi saath-saath patan hua
 The main settlements of the Harappan civilization were around the Saraswati river
 jab saraswati sookhne lagi, to log anya sthalon kii ore badhane lage
 Due to this, the settlements there fell
 jawaab : hamen bhashaa or lipi kaa fark samajhnaa chahie
 Sanskrit is the mother of all languages, it flourished in 2000 or 1500 BC
 haalanki bhashaai mudde kaa koi vaigyanik pramaan nahin miltaa he
 It can also be said that Sanskrit originates in all indo-european languages
 hamaara shodh bataata he ki pehle yahaan ke log baahar gayi, phir bahari log aaye
 This proves that Sanskrit had an impact on the languages there
 ab lipi kii baat
 The script of Harappan civilization has not yet been read
 is aadhaar par kaha ja saktaa he ki hadappa ke log bhi sanskritbhaashi the, bas unki lipi alag thi
 If we look at South India, Sanskrit is the most alive there
 dakshin bharat kii bhashaaon kaa sanskrit se bahut samya miltaa he
 Answer: Only five big cities are found in the Harappan civilization
 iske alaava aath-das chote shahar mili hai
 So far, more than 2,000 settlements of the Harappan civilization have been found
 adhikansh basaawatein gramin hai
 Vedic literature also mentions cities
 gyaat puratathvik saakshyon ke aadhaar par hadappa or vaidic sabhyataa ek hi sabit hoti he
 Rakhigarhi's excavations have found various geometrical firewoods
 vaidic sahitya main bhi in agnikundon kaa zikr he
 It is clear that the people of the Harappan civilization were fire worshipers
 hadappa ke log hi vaidic log the, iskaa isse bada kya saboot ho saktaa he?jawaab : yah shodh 2006 main shuru hua
 The excavations started and we kept collecting evidence
 hamane kayaason par nahin, vaigyanik-puratathvik pramaanon par jor diya
 Samples were tested at reputed global institutions
 vaigyanik-puratathvik saakshyon ke kaaran hi hamaara shodh ‘cell' main prakashit hua
 Now if all the results are available in 2019, what can we do? Even if it had happened earlier, people would have said something
 darasal jo raajnneeti se sanchalit ho rahe hai, unhen har cheez main raajnneeti dikhaai detii he

 On this, the Congress spokespersons retorted that this burqa is better than the bareness of communalism

 Bihar Police is always in the headlines for its exploits
 is baar bhi police kaa aisa majaak bana ki rajya ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ko sharmasaar hona padaa
 Former Chief Minister Dr
 jagannatha mishra ke antim sanskaar ke dauraan salaami ke liye uthi 22 riflon main se ek se bhi goli nahin nikali
 Dr
 jagannatha mishra kaa antim sanskaar buudhvaar ko unke paitruk gaanv balua supaul main kiya gaya, jisamen bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar or upmukhyamantri susheel modi bhi upasthit the
 Mishra died of a heart attack in New Delhi on Monday
 iske baad rajya sarkaar ne 3 din ke rajkeey shok kii ghoshnaa kii thi or unka antim sanskaar rajkeey sammaan ke saath kiya ja rahaa tha
 During the state honors, 22 rifles of the police rose towards the sky, but did not fire
 yani 22 ke 22 riflon se goli nahin chali
 As soon as the police status was revealed to the Chief Minister, the top officers started to look around
 mukhyamantri ne aiji kii taraf ishaara karke poocha ye kya ho rahaa he or jile ke espi ne yah kahkar apana pallaa jhaad liya ki yah ucchstareey maamla he, isliye is par dijipi hi kuch bataa paaenge

 com / vbnse7ontt— ANI (@ani)august 22, 2019bataa den ki soobe ke mukhiya nitish kumaar ne hameshaa kaha he ki jo bhi sansaadhan kii jarurat ho police ko wo dene ke liye taiyaar rahete hai or dete bhi hai lekin unhen rigelt chahie
 But no one thought that such a result would happen
 bihar police kaa hameshaa kisi na kisi kaaran majaak udata rahaa he
 Sometimes due to the activity of policemen, sometimes due to lack of resources
 lekin ye ghatana vaaki chaunkaane vaali he or isaki ucchstareey jaanch bhi honi chahie
 After all, how will the police fight criminals with the help of such bullets, which do not get out on the spot
 antim sanskaar main bhaag lene pahunche argedy ke vidhayak yaduwanshi yadav ne police main ghotaale kaa gambhir aarope lagaate hue jaanch kii maang kii he
 "there is a bigha of 20 Biswa
 40 biswa matlab do bigha
 i have so much land gaayon kaa hamalaa itnaa bad gaya ki khet main chaharadivari banani padi
 It takes 20 to 25 trolley stone pieces for one bigha
 ek trali 900 se 1200 rupee tak kii aati he
 If the tractor is from your home, then it costs 700-800 per trolley but usually Rs 1000 to 1200 per trolley
 pathar ke tukade trollies ke hisaab se milte hai
 These stones are being cut from the hill of Chandpur
 avaidh khanan suna he na aapane
 We are bringing it from there only
 ek bighas kii boundry banane main 35 se 40 hazaar lag jate hai
 It took me 60–70 thousand
 " This is not an account of the earnings, but of the cost which has started adding to the books of farmers due to cows
 rajasthan ke dhaulpur ke puraani chhavnee gaanv main kai kheton main charadivari nazar ai
 Even building a four to five foot boundary does not work
 use or ooncha or majboot banane ke liye contili jhaadiyon ko kaat kar deevaaron ke saath khadaa karnaa padataa he taaki gaayen phaand kar kheton main na ghus jaaen
 It also costs 10-15 thousand separately
 gaayon ne gaanvon ko badal diya he
 The names of cows in villages have changed
 koi unhen aawaara gaayen kahata he, koi gaay ke saath aatank jodta he
 On seeing the young cows, Modi ji, Yogi ji and Vasundhara ji have also started saying
 ye dekho, modi ji yogi ji ja rahe hai
 The politics of cow started at the behest of mother, has come at stray
 rajasthan main gaayon ko lekar kitni raajnneeti hui
 Due to strict rules, you will see bulls and cows roaming on the highway
 gwalior jate hue haive par ek bachade ko koi gaadiwaala maar gaya tha
 Seeing her suffering, my mind was agitated
 jagah-jagah par gaay, bail, bachade or sand ghoomte mil jaaenge
 Now nobody sells them
 koi nahin karidata he
 There are no cowsheds
 gaayon kaa samooh chaare kii talash main darbadar bhatak rahaa he
 When someone does not feed, then he will attack the other's fields
 pramod paliwal ne bataaya ki paanch foot diwaar banane se bhi kaam nahin chalata he
 Even after that, one has to go to the fields at night whether the cows have attacked
 kisaan ab chaukeedaari bhi kar rahaa he
 Last year, millet and gram crops suffered greatly
 november ke maheene main dhaulpur main mela lagata tha
 But the sale of animals did not happen that year due to the politics of cow slaughter
 koi karidaar nahin tha to sand or bachade ko vahiin chhod chale gaye
 Due to this also their number has increased here
 agar kheton ko diwaar se gherne ke liye 40-50 hazaar karch karne padenge to aap andaaza kiijie ki ham par kya guzari hogi
 Seeing the pictures that i have put up with this story, i had to see with my own eyes such an ugly scene, which not only the farmers are paying the mountain
 gaayon ke naam par kheton main diwaar banane ke liye in pattharon ke dhandhe se kise laabh hua hoga
 Surely, the benefit of the politics of cow slaughter would have been given to a section who would be engaged in supplying and cutting red stone rocks through illegal mining
 tippaniyan If you go to the villages of Rajasthan, look at the fields
 agar vahaan deevaaren milen to sochie ki raajnneeti kis tarah zamin par asar paidaa karti he
 By giving provocative statements about the cow in front of the TV, their politics was brightened by the middle class, but no one could see how farmers are paying its price
 agar gaushalaayein hotin, vahaan vyavasthaaen hoti to gaoo mata ko koi aawaara gaayen nahin kahata
 Do not fear the cows and build walls
 khule hue kheton main in deevaaron ke banane se gaanv ke raste badal gaye hai
 The ways of moving from one farm to another have changed
 rasta lanbaa ho gaya he
 Is curved
 yah mudda aapako nahin dikhegaa magar kheton main deevaaren dikhengi, un diwaron ke peeche kisaanon kii chintaa bhi ki gaayon ke kaaran 50 hazaar laga diya to bachaa kya
 If there is no change in this politics, soon either the fields in Rajasthan will be left vacant or there will be walls around every field where crops will not grow, they will build walls

 rajasthan ke gaanvon main jaaen to kheton ko dekhie
 If walls are found there, imagine how politics affects the land
 tivi ke saamne gaay ko lekar bhadakaane vaale bayaan dekar us madhyam varg ke bich apni raajnneeti to chamakaa gaye lekin uski keemat kisaan kis tarah se chukaa rahe hai, yah kisi ko nazar nahin aayaa
 If there were gaushalas, there would have been arrangements, then no one would ask cow mother to sing
 gaayon se khauf khaakar deevaaren nahin khadi karata
 The construction of these walls in open fields has changed the way of the village
 ek khet se duusare ke khet main jane ke raste badal gaye hai
 The path is long gone
 ghumaavdaar ho gaya he
 You will not see this issue, but the walls will be seen in the fields, the farmers also worry behind those walls that if 50 thousand are planted due to cows then what is left
 is raajnneeti main badlaav nahin aayaa to jaldi hi rajasthan main yaa to khet khaali chhod die jaaenge yaa phir har khet main chaaron taraf diwaar ban jaaegi jahaan fasalein nahin uga karengi, deevaaren bana karengi

 The Congress ruled out that Narendra Modi as the prime ministerial candidate of the BJP could be a challenge for the UPA in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections
 samvaadadaataaon dwaara yah puche jane par ki kya narendra modi samprag ke kendra main teesri baar satta main aane ke raste main baadha hai, party pravaktaa raashid alvi ne vyangatmak lahaze main kaha, ‘vahi narendra, jo gujarat ke mukhyamantri hai
 'alvi, while trying not to give any special attention to Modi's government in Gujarat for the third time, said,' Gujarat is one of the 28 states in the country
 congress ne bhi dilli main lagaataar teesri baar sarkaar banaayi he
 There is nothing unique in this
 ’yah puche jane par ki kya jaipur main hone vaale congress ke chintan shivi main charchaa main modi ek pramukh mudda honge congress pravaktaa ne kaha ki kisi ek vyakti ke bare main charchaa karne kaa sawaal nahin he
 We will discuss the problems before the country
 aam aadmi or garib kii samasya par charchaa karenge
 When asked if Rahul Gandhi would be fielded by the Congress to contest Modi in the next Lok Sabha elections, Alvi said that Rahul Gandhi is our leader
 vah desh ke netaa he
 The party wants to take the country forward under the leadership of him and Sonia Gandhi
 ’ The Gujarat government is now planning to extend the facility of e-voting to panchayat elections, despite an indifferent response to the recent civic elections
 philhal i-voting kii suvidha rajya ke sabhi aath nagar nigamon ke matadaataaon tak hi simit he
 The voters of the district, taluka and gram panchayat are yet to get this facility
 faisla lene se pehle rajya ke panchayat vibhaag ne is pariyojna kii vyavhaarikta ke sandarbh main bharat bhar se or anya deshon se soochna jutaney kaa kaam shuru kiya he
 According to the Minister of Panchayat and Rural Development, Jayanti Kavadia, the department is gathering the necessary information to start e-voting, the department is also collecting information about the connectivity of the Internet in the rural areas of the state
 cawadiya ne kaha, 'is samay hamaara vibhaag yah jaankaree juta rahaa he ki kya aisi koi suvidha bharat ke kisi hisse main yaa vishwa main kahin uplabdh he? yadi yah uplabdh he to vahaan iskaa sanchaalan kis tarah se kiya jaataa he?gujarat main i-voting ko lagu karne kaa khaakakhinchne ke liye aisi jaankaree hamaare liye jaruri he
 'less people are getting the e-voting facility in the recently concluded local body elections Gujarat State Election Commission (SEC) brought e-voting facility for voting in six municipal corporations
 ise udasin kism kii hi pratikriya mili
 a total of 95 of these six urban bodies
 9 lakh matadaataaon main se mahaj 806 logon ne hi online vot daalana pasand kiya
 The e-voting facility was provided to the voters of the municipal areas
 The Gujarat SEC is the first State Election Commission in the country to provide online voting facilities to the voters of the municipal areas of the state
 matadaataaon ko yah suvidha varsh 2010 main sabase pehali baar di gai thi
 This feature has been used for the second time in the recently concluded local body elections
 rajya nirvachan ayog ke sachiv em ve joshi ne kaha ki yadi panchayat vibhaag bhavishya main i-voting ko hari jhandi dikhaata he to uske liye nirvachan ayog kii taiyaari bhi puri he

 Civil service participants protested at Jantar Mantar over their demands
 civil seva ke un pratibhaagiyon ne dharna pradarshan main hissaa liya jo is maheene ghoshit hue praarambhik pariksha main apana sthaan banane main naakaam rahe
 These participants have demanded from UPSC that their preliminary examination scores should be made public
 'gabbar ij back' ke nirdeshak hai, krish or mukhya bhoomika nibhaai he, akshay kumaar, shruti hasan,suman talwaar or sunil grover ne
 Kareena Kapoor will also be seen in a guest role
 film kii kahani kaa thodaa-sa hint de detaa hum, aditya yani akshay kumaar neshnal college main professor hai or yahaan ke students ke fevorett hai or is college main na to police ghus sakati he na hi gunde, kyonki iskaa koi jawaab mere paas nahin he
 There is a wave of honesty in this college and it is Prof
 Aditya Gabbar, who fights against corruption, the rest of the story can be learned only by watching the film
 film chaahe kharaab ho yaa acchhee kyonki kisi bhi film ho usamen mehnat to lagati hi he or paisa bhi
 Now the thing is, how did i like the film, first let's talk about the flaws
 sabase pehali khami ye ki film kahani or film main aisa kuch nahin, jo aapane pehle kabhi na dekha ho, vahi ghisapita vishay, kitni hi filmein aa chuki hai, aisi hi kahani par, duusari cheez na to koi seen or na hi koi mode sivaay clymex ke jo aapako aakarshith karata he
 There are dialogues or scripts of the film where you cannot connect with it anywhere
 akshay dialogs bolte hai, par unka asar aap mahasoos nahin karte
 You keep watching the movie and walk out of the cinema hall without realizing it
 gabbar kaa nirdesan bhi mujhe kamjor laga
 Well there were flaws
 ab baat khoobiyon kin
 The comments khoobiyon main pehle abhinay kii baat kar lete hai
 Sunil Grover's character in the film emerges very well and he has also done a good job
 shruti ke paas karne ko film main zyaada kuch nahin he par vah jahaan bhi hai, apane kirdaar ke sur se nahin bhataktin
 This character is perfect for Akshay's height, but he is not able to make the character effective
 haa, unka ection acha he
 Akshay's fans may enjoy the film
 suman talwaar jo ki film main villen hai, vah bhi koi chhap nahin chhod pate
 Talking of songs, the song of the film is Teri Meri Kahani
 
 
 baaki aap film dekhie shaayad film main aapako kuch or khubiyaan dikh jaaen, to baaki faisalaa aapke haath main meri or se 'gabbar ij back' ko do stars
 Let me give a little hint to the story of the film, Aditya i
e
 Akshay Kumar is a professor in National College and a student's favorite here and neither the police nor the goons can enter this college, because i have no answer for this
 
 is college main eemaandaaree kii lahar bahati he or professor aditya hi gabbar hai, jo bhrashtachar ke khilaaf ladaai ladate hai baaki kahani to aap film dekhakar hi jaan sakate hai or janani bhi chahie
 Whether the film is bad or good, whatever the film is, it takes hard work and money
 ab baat yah ki mujhe film kisi lagi to pehle khaamiyon kii baat kar lete hai
 The first drawback is that there is nothing in the film story and the film, which you have never seen before, the same gripping theme, how many films have come, on the same story, except the other thing neither a scene nor a twist
 Climax that attracts you
 film ke dialogs ho yaa script kahin bhi aap uske saath jud nahin pate
 Akshay speaks dialogues, but you don't feel their impact
 aap film dekhte rahete hai or bina ise mahasoos kiye cinema haul se baahar nikal jate hai
 Gabbar's direction also found me weak
 khayr ye thi khamiyaan
 Now talk about the merits
 tippaniyan Let's talk about acting first in merits
 film main sunil grover kaa kirdaar bahut achche se ubhar kar aata he or unhone kaam bhi acha kiya he
 Shruti does not have much to do in the film, but wherever she is, she does not deviate from her character's voice
 akshay kii kad-lathi ke liye yah kirdaar bilkul thik he par vah kirdaar ko prabhaavshaalee nahin bana pate
 Yes, his action is good
 akshay ke phans shaayad film kaa majaa uthaa saken
 Suman Talwar, who is a villain in the film, also does not leave any mark
 gaanon kii baat karen to film kaa gaanaa teri meri kahani thik hai
 
 
 The rest of you watch the film, perhaps you can see some more qualities in the film, then the rest of the decision is two stars in my hand from 'gabbar is Back'

 PM Modi will go to Riyadh in Saudi Arabia next week
 There is a big investment program in Riyadh from 29 to 31 October
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi will visit Saudi Arabia next week
 vah saudi arab ke shahar riyaad main yojit hone vaale tisare future investment inishiative (FII) main shaamil honge, jo 29 se 31 oktober tak yojit hogi
 This year's theme of this annual investment program is 'what is Next for Global Business', that is, what will happen next in global business
 saudi arab ke public investment fund dwaara yojit yah kaarykram ek ucch stareey plateform he jisamen saudi arab ke niti-niyantaaon or vaishvik kaarobaari pratinidhiyon se milane kaa mauka miltaa he
 Two targets will be shot with one stone, PM Modi is going to Saudi Arabia on such an important occasion, on the issue of Kashmir, India is trying to send a message to the world that everything is fine there
 yah pradhanmantri narendra modi kii saudi arab kii duusari yatra hogi
 PM Modi's visit is important in the sense that along with conveying the message on Kashmir, he will also explore the possibilities of accelerating investment and economic development
 piem modi kii yatra kii taiyaari ke liye rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar (NSA) ajit dobhaal isi maheene riyaad gaye the
 Both countries are trying to deepen cooperation on the issues of economy, defense, energy and terrorism
 iske pehle piem modi saal 2016 main riyaad gaye the, tab unhen saudi arab kaa sarvocch naagarik sammaan diya gaya tha
 PM will not go to Turkey It is worth mentioning that PM Modi was also supposed to go to Turkey after this visit to Saudi, but openly joined Pakistan in raising the Kashmir issue and Financial Action Task Force (FATF) meeting through Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan After delivering, India has canceled Prime Minister Narendra Modi's proposed visit to Turkey
 kyon radd hui turki kii yatra?mana ja rahaa he ki turki ke pakistan ke prati ravaiye ke maddenor bharat ne yah kadam uthaaya he

 uttar pradesh kii yogi adityanath sarkaar ne saharanpur hinsa kii jaanch report grih mantralay ko saunp di he
 Aaj Tak has received a copy of this report, blaming the Bhima Sena and BJP MP Raghav Lakhanpal besides the administration for the communal and ethnic violence in Saharanpur
 grih mantralay ko bheji gai chah pannon kii is report ke mutabik, bhim army ne saharanpur main jaateey hinsa ko hawa di
 At the same time, the administration's failure also helped to incite this violence
 saharanpur ke donon bade afasaron yani dm or SSP ke bich koi samanvay nahin tha, jisase hinsa ko kaabo karne main dikkat hui
 The report reads, 'in Saharanpur violence, Bhim Army founder Chandrashekhar and former BSP MLA Ravinder alias Molu also played an important role and led violent demonstrations
 chandrashekhar kii aguai main bhim army ne rajput or daliton ke bich jaanboojhkar hinsa bhadakaane kaa kaam kiya
 Not only this, while the violence continued, some anti-social elements from the surrounding area, who belong to the minority community, tried to take political advantage from the Saharanpur incident
 'report main yah bhi kaha gaya he ki saharanpur kii hinsa ek sochi samajhi sajeesh kaa hissaa thi
 People associated with various political parties here have incited violence on several occasions
 is report main silsilewar tareeke se likhaa gaya he ki kaise or kab-kab hinsa bhadakaane kii koshish kii gai
 Not only this, the role of BJP MP Raghav Lakhanpal has also been considered objectionable in the report and he has also been held responsible for inciting violence in the report sent to the Ministry of Home Affairs
 padhein saharanpur hinsa par yogi sarkaar kii puri reportraghav lakhanpal ke bare main report main likhaa gaya he, 'bijepi saansad ne april 2016 main prashasan kii ijazat ke bagaiyr na sirf shobhaayatra nikaali, balki shobhaayatra ko alpsankhyak bahul ilaake se bhi jaanboojhkar nikaala
 This was opposed by the Muslim community and due to this communal violence erupted there
 vahiin is report main saharanpur jaateey hinsa ke liye prashasnic naakaami ko jimmedaar mana he
 It said, on April 5 this year, the administration neither reviewed the situation nor sought a ground report from the police before granting permission for the procession on Maharana Pratap Jayanti
 nateeja yah hua ki jab dalit bahul ilaake se shobhaayatra nikali, to deje ke istemaal kaa daliton ne virodh kiya or halaat tanaavpurn ho gaye
 According to the report, four days after the incident, ie on 9 April, Heebeam Army Chandrasekhar sought permission to hold a protest rally at Gandhi Park, which the administration denied
 isi ke baad bhim army ke log hinsak ho gaye
 Chandrashekhar started activities like forming small groups, assaulting passersby, setting vehicles on fire, attacking police and administration teams
 grih mantralay ko bheji gai is report main 23 may ko hui mayawati kii raily kaa bhi zikr he, jisamen kaha gaya he ki mayawati kii raily ke dauraan dalit samudaay ke kai netaaon ne duusari jati kii mahilaon ke bare main aapattijnak tippaniyan kii thim, jisaki vajah se ek baar phir saharanpur main hinsa bhadak gai
 In such a situation, it is clear from this report that the violence of Saharanpur spread not only due to the negligence of top government officials, but the leaders also left no stone unturned to send Saharanpur into the fire of violence in the greed of caste votes

 pakistan ke balakot samet kai aatanki campon par hue airstrike ko lekar bhartiya vayusena ne kai khulaase kiye
 On Monday, Air Force Chief BS Dhanoa said that our fighter plane has destroyed the target
 yadi ham target ko maarane kii yojana banaate hai, to ham target ko maarthe hai
 Otherwise why he (pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan) has responded, if we drop bombs in the jungles then why will he reply
 vayusena chif bies dhanoa ne kaha ki aatankiyon ke khilaaf hamaara oparation jari he
 BS Dhanoa also answered the five questions that the whole of India was asking
 pehla sawaal- airstrike ke dauraan kitne aatanki maare gaye?jawaab-marane waalon kii sankhya ke bare main bhartiya vayusena ko koi jaankaree nahin he
 The government will clarify this
 hamen target diya jaataa he or ham us target ko udaate hai
 It is not our job to count the number of people killed
 doosraa sawaal- pakistan ke epa-16 vimaan ko mig-21 se kyon jawaab diya gaya?jawaab-mig -21 bison ek sakasham vimaan he, ise unnat kiya gaya he
 It has better radar, air-to-air missiles and better weapon systems
 ek yojanabaddh oparation hota he, jisamen aap yojana banaate hai or apane fiter jet ko le jate hai
 But when someone attacks you, you respond immediately
 chaahe us samay aapke paas koi fiter jet maujuud ho
 All our fighter aircraft are capable of fighting the enemy
 teesraa sawaal- wing commander abhinandan ab kab fiter plane udaayenge?jawaab-vah (wing commander abhinandan) fiter plane udaate hai yaa nahin, yah unke medical fitness par nirbhar karegaa
 Post ejection is his medical examination, whatever treatment will be required will be given
 ek baar jab hamen unka medical fitness mil jayega, phir vah fiter jet ke cockpit main ja sakenge
 Fourth question- Has Pakistan broken its agreement with America using F-16? Answer- i am not aware of the agreement between Pakistan and America
 agar is samjhaute ke tahat pakistan ko epa-16 se kisi desh par hamalaa nahin karnaa tha to unhone yah samjhauta todaa he
 We have evidence that they used the F-16 and fired missiles from it
 is dauraan unke ek epa-16 ko hamane maar bhi giraaya
 Fifth question- Will the Indian Air Force take action against the terrorists again? Answer - The Indian Air Force operation is going on right now
 yah rukaa nahin he
 So, we will not make any comments right now
 ucchtam nyaayalyanapi je thomski niyukti ko radd kar diya he
 PJ Thomas was appointed by the Central Government to the post of Central Vigilance Commissioner on which the dispute was going on
 ucchtam nyaayalay ne kendriya sartakta ayukta ke taur par pi je thomas kii niyukti radd kii
 The Supreme Court said that the recommendations made by the High Level Committee on the appointment of Thomas were 'not in accordance with the law'
 ’ nyaayalay ke mutabik, samiti thomas ke khilaaf karrwai kii anushansa karne vaali sambandhit saamagree par vichaar karne main asafal rahi
 The court also rejected the government's contention that the approval given by the Vigilance Department for the appointment of CVC in 2008 made it the basis for Thomas' name to be included in the candidate list for appointment to the post
 nyaayalay ne kaha ki thomas ke naam kii anushansa karte hue na to samiti or na hi sarkaar ke kisi adhikari ne sivisi karyaalay kii sansthagat eemaandaaree ke vyapak mudde par dhyaan kendrit diya
 According to the Supreme Court, the criterion for appointment of CVC is not only institutional honesty, but also the personal honesty of the candidate
 nyaayalay ke mutabik, bhavishya main koi bhi niyukti keval naukarshahon ke liye simit nahin rahani chahie, isamen duusare kshetron se jude bedaag nishtha vaale logon ke naamon par bhi vichaar kiya janaa chahie
 The court also rejected Thomas and the government's argument that cvc's appointment could not be brought under judicial review
 nyaayalay ne kaha ki anushansaaon kii vaidhaniktaa ko nyaayik samiksha ke tahat laayaa ja saktaa he
 The court said that the committee did not consider the pending criminal case against Thomas
 iske alaava prashikshan or carmik vibhaag ne unke khilaaf 2000 se 2004 ke bich anushaasanamak karrwai karne kii anushansa kii thi, samiti ne us par bhi vichaar nahin kiya

 Bhuvneshwar Kumar returned the pavilion to the top 3 batsmen of South Africa on a score of just 12 runs
 pehle seshan main teen wicket ganvaane vaali africa team ne duusare seshan main chaar wicket kho die the
 After lunch, Indian fast bowlers dismissed de Villiers, du Plessis, de Kock and Vernon Philander and pushed South Africa to the backfoot
 south africa kaa score ek samay 202 par 6 wicket tha
 But, the dismissal of new batsman Keshav Maharaj at the crease proved costly for Team India
 darasal, 47wein over kii duusari gend par shikhar dhawan ne slip main keshav maharaj kaa aasaan sa kaich tapakaa diya, us samay unhone khaataa bhi nahin kholaa tha
 But, after this, Keshav Maharaj took an aggressive approach and hit 35 runs, which can prove to be important for South Africa
 jis vakt keshav maharaj out hue south africa kaa score 258 ran tak pahunch chukaa tha
 Maharaj partnered 19 runs for the 7th wicket with Vernon Philander, while adding 37 runs for the 8th wicket with Kagiso Rabada
 agar us vakt dhawan keshav maharaj kaa kaich pakad lete to south africa 250 ran se pehle hi dher ho sakati thi
 But, Team India missed this opportunity
 ab maharaj kaa kaich chhodana kitna baari padataa he yah bhartiya pari ke dauraan pataa chalegaa
 Because, the score of 286 runs on this green top wicket of Cape Town can be challenging for India

 Because the officer who has been accused of irregularities and scams in the Indira Awaas Yojana is progressing in the same district to make a DDC, this work is being done in good governance
 darbhanga jile ke virol prakhand ke tatkaaleen BDO kaari prasad mahato ko 2011 main hi police ne naa keval indira awaas yojana main gadabadi karne kaa doshi paaya tha balki police un par giraftaar or kurki japti ke bhi aadesh the
 But this accused has now been made the DDC i
e
 District Development Commissioner of Darbhanga district, while again on 20 August 17 a warrant of arrest has been issued against this officer
 is mudde par darbhanga ke saansad kirti aaazaad ne jamkar apni bhadaas nikaali
 Attacking the good governance of Nitish Kumar, he said that if the law in Bihar had done its job, the accused officer would not have got the reward but would have been behind bars
 unhone police adhikariyon ko bhi nishane par lete hue kaha ki agar netaa faraar yaa varantee hota he to police netaa ke nomination ke samay pehle se hi hathkadi lekar khadi rahati he to in aaropee adhikariyon ke samay aisa kyon nahin hota?duusari taraf saalon biit jane par bheeindira awaas yojanamein gadabadi kii shikaayat karne vaale yachikakarta ko ab bhi ummid he ki unhen nyaay jarur milegaa
 The special thing is that the petitioner had only complained against the panchayat but in the investigation itself, the police also caught the mess of officers and made the accused, but unfortunately nothing happened in the name of action
 maamle par darbhanga ke esaspi satyavir singh ne bhi ghatana kii pushti karte hue kaha ki kai logon ke saath tatkaaleen BDO kaari prasad mahato ke khilaaf giraftaar ke aadesh the lekin unhone 2014 main adaalat se jamaanat le lee or phir se abhi agast 2017 maheene main giraftaar or kurki japti ke aadesh nikaalnaa cese anusandhanak keelaaparvaaheehai
 But the question arises that after the accused BDO took bail from the court at the same time, then why did it not answer on camera? And another question that if bail is granted, then why did the police officer order arrest and attachment on 20 August 2017? The question is also that despite the allegations of BDO being proved true in the police investigation only in 2011, how did he continue to work in another district and why the police could not arrest him even after so many years? The biggest question is how the government tainted Instead of punishing the officers, he was seen to be kind to him and by giving successive promotions, the then tainted BDO was finally made the DDC of Darbhanga district

 In the midst of the ongoing controversy over the DDCA, Jung has questioned the one-member Gopal Subramaniam Commission of Inquiry to probe the scam
 LG ke mutabik jaanch ayog kaa gathan gaiyrkanoonee he kyonki iske liye uparajyapal or centre kii sahmati nahin lee gai
 According to the letter of acceptance of the Center and LG, LG cited the Commission of Inquiry Act, 1952, saying that Delhi is a union territory and hence the Delhi government cannot order an inquiry without the approval of the Center and the Lieutenant Governor

 iske alaava koi bhi ayog rajyapal ke marfatkendre sarkaaraki sahmati praapt karne ke baad hi gathit kiya ja saktaa he
 Based on this logic, the Commission constituted by the Kejriwal government to investigate the CNG fitness kit scam was also rejected by the Lieutenant Governor

 The central government could only consider this Thursday, but the decision could not be taken due to the official holiday due to milad-ul-nabi
 centre sarkaar ke sutron ne bhi daawa kiya he ki jis tarah secogeriwal sarkaarne gopal subramanyam ayog kaa gathan kiya he, vah puri tarah aspasht he
 Kejriwal has not complied with the provisions of the Inquiry Act
 2011 main rajasthan kaa maamalaict ke mutabik koi bhi ayog 'janhit ke liye mahatvapurn or nishchit maamle' kii jaanch ke liye gathit kiya ja saktaa he
 Central government sources said that this commission, constituted by the Kejriwal government of Delhi, does not fulfill these conditions
 ek adhikari ne udhaaharan dete hue kaha ki isi tarah se rajasthan kii purvavarti ashok gahalot sarkaar dwaravasundhara raaje kijaanch ke liye gathit ayog ko 2011 main nyaaypalika se manjuuri nahin mil saki thi

 Nadane is termed baseless
 india today se khaas baatcheet main unhone kaha ki media ne khud vivaad kii khabaren banaain or yah bhi jod diya ki pradhanmantri ne dakhal dekar bich kaa rasta nikaala he
 He said, the news of the Prime Minister interfering in this matter is not correct
 unka kahana ki pradhanmantri swasthya ke maamle main samvedansheel hai
 The way he supervises other subjects is also about this ministry
 jahaan tak cigarette cedibbon par chetavanika maamla usamen vah apni puraane notification ke prati patibaddh hai

 But later there were reports from Bengaluru that Modi had directed it to be 60 per cent
 lekin india today ke saath khaas baatcheet main is sawaal paraswasthya mantri naddane kaha, hamaari sarkaar sansadeey paramparaon main yakeen karti he or sthaayee samiti main mantralay ne jab apni baat rakh di to samiti ne kuch samay maang liya
 As such, it is now the property of the Parliamentary Committee and now we are waiting for its report

 Not explicitly, but Nadda clearly indicated that the old notifications will not change as the government is serious about health

 By the time the mistake was discovered, it was too late and hit the Titanic iceberg
 is pustak main yahaan tak kaha gaya he ki takkar ke baad bhi chaalak dal or us par savaar yatriyon ko doobane se bachaaya ja saktaa tha agar jahaaj ko takkar ke baad ulti disha main na chalaakar vahiin sthir khadaa kar diya jaataa

 Krrish had said- When i talked to Kangana about name molestation, she said that you did not help me in the episode of Sonu Sood, you have come now if you need to
 unhone kaha ki unhen anger management ishyu he
 She shouted at me
 jab maine film dekhi to usamen meraa naam sepperate slide main tha
 i don't know how Kangana can sleep peacefully by putting her name in Direction First Credit
 jabaki ve ise diserv nahin karatin
 Krrish also said- "the film was completely edited in June

 Kangana was shooting for "mantle Hai Kya" in London

 The Prime Minister assured the Lokpal to include Citizen Charter, lower bureaucracy and appointment of Lokayuktas in the states
 anna hajaare ne kaha, "in muddon ko sansad main laayaa gaya or in muddon par bani sahmati kii ek prati mujhe bhi bheji gai thi jiske baad maine apana agast kaa anshan samaapt karne kaa nirnay liya tha
 "the social worker said," This betrayed the whole country
 
 Is this a government or a shop? The Prime Minister sent a letter stating that these three issues would be brought under the Lokpal Bill
 pradhanmantri kaa patr kooday kii tokari main phenk diya gaya
 Why such politics? "anna Hazare said," There is someone behind it
 
 We suspect that Rahul Gandhi is behind this
 
 Because without their intervention this is not possible
 yahi kaaran he ki ye samasyaayein upasthit hui hai
 "in order to put forth his point, Anna Hazare also said that Team Anna will work with Rahul Gandhi in future
 anna hajaare ne kaha, "lokapal mudde par sabhi ke rukh ko dhyaan main rakhte hue rahul gandhi ko is par nirnay lenaa he
 We will work with them in the future and i believe in the youth power of this country
 " saamaajik kaaryakarta anna hajaare se yah puche jane par ki vah kyon rahul gandhi ko nishaanaa bana rahe hai, jabaki yuvaaon ke saath kaam karne par unka jor rahaa he or kendriya kanoon mantri salmaan khurshid ne kaha he ki rahul ne bhi ek prabhavi lokapal vidheyak kaa samarthan kiya he
 Responding to the queries of journalists, the social worker said, "many believe that Rahul Gandhi will soon become Prime Minister but if he does not change his current views on Lokpal it will be dangerous for the country
 " gyaat ho ki sarkari lokapal vidheyak ke masaude kaa virodh karne ke liye anna hajaare shanivaar ko nai dilli pahunche
 He will undertake a daylong fast on Sunday at Jantar Mantar
 lokapal vidheyak kaa pareekshan karne vaali sansad kii sthaayee samiti ne apni report shuukravaar ko sansad ke donon sadanon main pesh kii
 Anna Hazare called it 'a weak bill' and blamed Rahul Gandhi for it
 anna hajaare se yah poochne par ki vah sanyukt pragatisheel gathbandhan (samprag) kii adhyaksh sonia gandhi ko nishane par kyon nahin le rahe hai
 To this, he said that Sonia is not well, so he does not want to disturb her
 unhone kaha, "sonia swasth nahin hai
 If he says something, then his health can worsen
 " unhone kaha ki jin rajyon main vidhansabha chunaav hone hai vahaan team anna jaaegi or jan lokapal vidheyak ke prati logon ko jaagruk karne ke saath hi is par congress kaa rukh spasht karegi
 Anna Hazare said, "we will also ask the people what is the benefit of sending those in power who do not want to eradicate corruption from the country
" ham agle do saalon tak lagaataar sangharsh karte rahenge
 Before the general elections, we will visit the entire country to create awareness among the people
 un logon ko dobaaraa satta main bhejne kaa kya phayda jinhone desh ko barbaad kar diya he
 "apart from this, Anna Hazare targeted Congress leaders and said that his team will campaign against Congress
 team anna ke pramukh sadsy prashanth bhushan ne kaha ki ve apane agle kadam se pehle lokapal vidheyak par sansad ke nirnay kaa intjaar karenge
 Let it be known that the winter session of Parliament is coming to an end on 22 December
 bhushan ne kaha ki lokapal vidheyak kaa pareekshan karne vaali sansad kii sthaayee samiti ke kai sadsy report par asahmati note de chuke hai
 At the same time, Arvind Kejriwal said that the chairman of the committee, Abhishek Manu Singhvi said that the committee is not working for any institution or any person but has recommended constitutional status to the Lokpal
 unhone aisa rahul gandhi ke liye kiya he kyonki unhone lokapal sanvaidhanik darja dene kii baat kahi thi
 Earlier, Anna Hazare called the committee's report as 'weak' and 'ineffective'
 unhone kaha, "sarkaar bhrashtachar mitaane ke prati gambheer nahin he
 The government does not have the will to dismiss the report of the standing committee
 " Place Nehru Place Computer Market
 subah ke 10 baje hai
 Suddenly some teenagers are noticeable
 tite genes, paanv main fashneble juute, charhari kad-lathi or ekadam chaukanne
 Their activity increases as the day progresses
 11 baje tak ye nehru place computer market main fail jate hai
 They carry the voice for the catalog in hand, "software, Software"
 
 
 har guzarane vaale ko kai software ke naam lekar phuslane kii koshish shuru ho jaati he
 Seeing the customer stop, they immediately hand over the catalog and say, "sir, what will you take

 "if the deal is sealed, the spot is pirated DVD of expensive software
" ye kishor itane sadhe dhang se in software ke naam lete hai ki aap gachha kha jaaen
 15-year-old Amit, who sells pirated DVD / cds of software at Nehru Place, knows the ABC of all software well
 usase yah poochne par ki vah kitna padhaa hua he usne jawaab diya he, ''paanchavin fail
 "they get 150 to 250 rupees for this everyday work
" milte hai
 Experts believe that the reason for employing these teenagers in their work is due to their young age, which weakens the screws of the law
 nehru place main piresi ke kaarobaar se judaa anil (badla hua naam) bataata he, ''adhiktar software internet ke jariye crack hote hai yaa phir kai maamalon main to company ke andar ke hi log shaamil hote hai
 Sources reveal that piracy businesses in Nehru Place operate from the Red Dora areas around it
 yahaan kii ghani aabaadi ke kaaran unke pakade jane kaa khatra bhi kam he
 If you look at the arithmetic of piracy, Bablu (changed name) associated with the business of pirated DVD says, "40,000 to 50,000 to get into this business
" kharch karne hote hai
 Then Rs 20,000 to 25,000 every month through piracy
 aasaani se kamaaye ja sakate hai
 Apart from software, dvds of movies, music and games are also sold
 ''ghani aabaadi vaale kisi saste ilaake main ek cameraa, 15,000 se 25,000 ru
 a computer or laptop up to Rs 3,000 to Rs 5,000

 a multiple DVD writer up to
 isi se shuru hota he piresi kaa khel
 Asked where the software is from, Bablu's answer was a bit shocking, "there are some people in the US and Europe who have all the resources but nothing special to do
" ve is tarah ke software kharidkar unhen internet par daal dete hai
 In many cases, hackers or people within the company deliver software to the market
 china bhi pirated software kaa bada bazaar he
 Sumit Khanna, director of Microsoft India Genuine Software Initiative, says, "the industry is suffering a huge loss in research and development due to pirated software
 '' jabaki ol dilli computer treders association ke chairman shyaam modi nehru place kii dukaanon main kisi tarah kii piresi se saaf inkaar karte hai
 He says, "no pirated merchandise is available at shops in Nehru Place
" is kaam ko howers anjaam dete hai or unke saath software companiyon kii mileebhagat bhi rahati he
 "there are around 10,000 shops and 500 hawkers in this market
" inamen se sirf 100 ke hi paas license hai
 In this case, monitoring them is a big task
 yah market kalkaji thane ke tahat aati he
 When asked by SHO Ranbir Singh, his reply was, "no such complaint has been received at the moment
" hamaari nolej main is tarah kaa koi kaam nahin ho rahaa he
 "while Delhi Police PRO Rajan Bhagat says," In 2010-11, there were three raids on Microsoft's complaint
 isamen 2010 main najafagarh main chapa maarane par nehru place kii dukaanon main piresi kii baat nikali thi
 While raiding there, we found 530 dvds / cds of the software which cost around Rs 15 lakh
 thi
 Two people were also arrested
 ''ise piresi kii hi maar kahenge ki bharat main pisi software se judi kul kamai kaa sirf ek-tihaai hi software companiyon kii jeb main jaataa he, baaki sara piresi kii bhent chadh jaataa he
 Pirated software is operating in 41 percent of computers worldwide
 jisase software industry ko lagbhag 53 arab dollar kaa nuksaan ho rahaa he
 Government treasury is also suffering a huge tax in the form of piracy
 microsoft or adobi jaisi software companiyon kaa pratinidhitiv karne vaale trade group bijness software elliance (biese) kii diarector lizam mishra bataati hai, ''biese or idisi ke adhyayan main yah baat saamne ai ki bharat sarkaar ko 2009 main 65 fisadi piresi dar ke kaaran 86
 There was a loss of $ 60 million
 '' jabaki nehru place main ho rahi piresi se hone vaale nuksaan kii baat karen to shyaam modi andaaj lagaate hai, ''piresi ke kaarobaar se rojaanaa lagbhag 30 lakh ru
 Is being lost
 ''united stats trade ripregentative (uastiar) kii ity kshetra main vishwa ke sabase kukhyat 30 bazaaron par out-of-cycle report main nehru place ko jagah di gai he
 Apart from Nehru Place, the names of Red Jones (thailand), Silk Market (china) and Urdu Bazaar (pakistan) of Asia can be taken prominently
 is suchi main naam aane par nehru place ke vyapaaree khaase naaraaz bhi hai
 Expressing his displeasure, Mahendra Aggarwal, the owner of the Broadway Computers here and president of the All Delhi Computer Traders Association, calls it a US conspiracy
 unka kahana he, ''america hamaare bazaar ko badnaam karne ke liye aisa kar rahaa he
 Companies of the same country have a hand in piracy
 '' software piresi main companiyon kii bhoomika par sawaal uthaate hue agarwal kehete hai, ''nehru place main kai badi software companiyon ke offis hai
 These pirated software are being sold in front of his office
 ve kyon nahin rokte?''beshak piresi se hone vaala nuksaan bahut bada he
 But one reason for this is that software is considered expensive
 piresi kaarobaar se jude anil kehete hai, ''jitne kaa computer hardware aata he, usase kai guna mahange software padate hai
 Rajesh, a designing student who is shopping at Nehru Place itself, says, "I spent 17,000
 main computer kharida he
 Windows-7 itself Rs 7,600
 kaa he, emes offis-10-13,000 ru
 Other packages related to design and design are very expensive
 unhen khareednaa mere bas kii baat nahin
 It is like pirated software itself
 ''mahange software ke bare main nehru place ke ek dukandaar bataate hai, ''agar company koi software 10,000 ru
 If we sell it, then the number of people taking it will be less and it will have to provide support to less people
 use kam logon ko sarvice deni padegi
 If the software is Rs 1,000
 kaa hoga to company ko 10 software bechney par 10,000 ru
 Will meet and also have to give support to 10 people
 isiilie companiyaan inaki keemat zyada rakhti hai
 Pirated of course can be cheap
 lekin pirated software ke khatre bhi kam nahin hai
 Summing up these threats, Sumit Khanna says, "customers should be aware of the dangers of these pirated software
 inase data los to ho hi saktaa he, aapaki nijee jaankaree bhi galat haathon main ja sakati he
 In addition, many times the system runs slow and can also cause system crashes
 pirated antiveyras kai baar virus detect karne main bhi asafal rahete hai
 However, people associated with piracy talk of reaching 20 to 30 per cent of the business
 ve bataate hai, ''ab indiviual piresi zyada bad gai he
 When two or three people come to get the software, one of them will say that hey it is in my pen drive
 mujhase le lenaa
 "if you look at the BSA figures, then the point behind it is also understandable
" bharat main computaron kii bikri main jabardast ijapha hua he
 In 2010, this figure was about 93 lakhs
 internet kaa prayog bhi badha he
 Around 1 at this time worldwide
 7 arab log internet yujar hai
 In such a situation, increasing information on the internet has opened up new avenues for piracy
 is bare main dilli ke chaatr piyush bataate hai, ''ab mujhe pirated game, film yaa software ke liye bazaar nahin janaa padataa
 i have a connection of 2 Mbps here
 jo chaaho aasaani se downlod karo
 '' There are many websites that provide not only the software they want but also movies, games or music
 pear tu pear ke jariye bhi log software kharidkar apane puure sarkal main baant dete hai
 Sources reveal that along with Delhi's Nehru Place, now the black business of piracy has started establishing its roots in areas like Janakpuri, Tilak Nagar, Okhla, Chandni Chowk, Laxmi Nagar and Chirag Delhi
 '' dilli ke palika bazaar or gaffaar market ke naam to shuru se hi piresi ke saath judate rahe hai
 Pawan Duggal, a cyber law expert and Supreme Court advocate, defines software piracy as "the use, reproduction or distribution issues of the software without the owner's consent
" '' visheshgy software piresi ke chaar rup bataate hai
 First, the owner of the software loads more than a machine authorized under license
 doosraa, computer dealer computer kii hard discs main gaiyr-adhikrut software lod karke degaa
 Third, the illegal reproduction of software and market it
 chauthaa, internet piresi
 "the laws related to this are weak and bailable
" '' piresi par lagaam kasne ke liye majboot kanoon jaruri he
 If we look at the history of Nehru Place, in 1969 it was planned as Kalkaji District Center
 indira gandhi ne 1972 main iskaa namakaran pandit jawaharlal nehru ke naam par nehru place kar diya
 The computer business started in 1986 at Nehru Place
 isaki lokapriyata itani badi ki 1988 main desh ke tatkaaleen pradhanmantri rajeev gandhi yahaan se personal computer kharidkar le gaye the
 On the advantages of stopping piracy, Mishra says, "if software piracy is reduced, it will increase the country's GDP by 4
" 6 arab dollar kaa yogadan hoga
 About 59,000 jobs will be created
 ''beshak, dhai dashak pehle ek sakaaratmak pahal ke saath shuru hua nehru place in dinon badanaami kaa dansh jhel rahaa he
 On seeing this market, it seems to be quite calm from above
 lekin ab samay aa gaya he ki piresi par shikanja kasne ke liye is tarah ke thikaanon kii gahare tak padtaal kii jaae

 haal hi main mamata banerjee kii taraf se party workars ke liye kuch chaunkaane vaale farmaan saamne aae hai
 Mamta Banerjee has instructed that women should not apply lipstick during election campaign
 jahaan anya partiyaan ise chunavi stant bataa rahi hai, vahiin tiemasi main bhi isko lekar alag-alag raay saamne aa rahi he
 By the way, in Delhi, the party's star candidate Vishwajit Mamta's 'yes in Yes' is seen shaking
 anushaasan se lipistak or sari kii maiching kii bindi se kya lenaa ho saktaa he? aap bhi soch main pad gaye honge ki ye kaisaa sawaal he
 But recently, Mamta Didi has warned her workers to stay away from fashion till the election, do not put lipstick, do not wear a dot that matches the saree
 vahiin purushon ko bhi sharaab se dur rahane ko kaha gaya he
 The party says that it is necessary to practice discipline during elections, especially at a time when Mamata Banerjee's eyes are set on the politics of Delhi
 vaise bengal main is farmaan kaa asar ho yaa na ho, par dilli main tiemasi ke star ummidavaar vishwajit isse puri tarah se sahamat najar aate hai
 Vishwajeet says that what is the need of going out for the promotion of fashion tax? They agree with Mamta Didi
 duusari partiyaan ise sirf chunaav stant hi bataa rahi hai
 The leaders even say that why Mamata's statement is not being acted upon, this is a fatwa
 bijepi netaa muqataar abbaas nakvi ne kaha, 'mamata ji ko lagata he ki wo har baat se upar hai
 Such things have no effect in elections
 'samaajawaadee party ke netaa naresh agarwal ne kaha, 'ab mahila ayog is par karrwai kyon nahin karata? ye ko fatwa jari kiya gaya he
 'leave outside, inside the TMC, there is a difference in the workers regarding this decree
 kuch workars kehete he ki didi ne jo kiya, thik he
 Some say that alcoholism is understandable, but what was said for women is not right
 baharhaal, chunaav ke dauraan is tarah kii baaten saamne aana haasyaaspad to he hi, saath hi ye farmaan bahut-si mahilaon ko aahat bhi kar rahaa he
 The ordinance's drive to prevent the dismissal of convicted mp-mlas from membership was intensified when Congress leader and former minister Rashid Masood was convicted in a scam case
 sansad main bill lambit hone ke baavjood cabinet ne adhyadesh paarit kar manjuuri ke liye raashtrapati ke paas bhej diya
 The main opposition party BJP took a tough stand against this ordinance
 loksabhaa main vipaksh kii netaa sushamaa swaraj ne raashtrapati se adhyadesh par hastakshar nahin karne kii apil kii or 26 sitambar ko bijepi sansadeey dal ke adhyaksh laalkrishna adwani, rajyasabha main vipaksh ke netaa arun jetali ke saath raashtrapati pranab mukherjee ko gyaapan saunp diya
 The Aam Aadmi Party also opened its front
 iske baad congress ke bheetar se bhi virodh ke sur uthne lage, jise dekh raashtrapati ne sarkaar ke teen varisht mantriyon kapil sibbal, susheel kumaar scindia or kamalnath ko talab kar safai maangi
 But according to sources, the President hinted at taking a final decision on the ordinance and consulting legal advice only after Prime Minister Manmohan Singh returned from a foreign visit in view of the controversy
 congress ko yah dar sataane laga tha ki kahin mukherjee bhi purv raashtrapati apije abdul kalam kii raah chal pade to bhrashtachar ke trek par chal rahi congress netritv vaali sarkaar ko paanch rajyon ke vidhansabha chunaav main mushkil hogi
 Kalam rejected the law passed by Parliament in the matter of the post of profit and returned it for reconsideration
 daagiyon ko bachaane vaale is adhyadesh ko lekar ladaai sirf rajnatik nahin, balki kanoonee bhi ho chuki thi
 In such a situation, Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi himself pioneered the initiative to establish high moral standards under the strategy
 supreme court ne 10 july ko apane faisle main kaha tha ki kisi saansad yaa vidhayak ko do saal yaa usase adhik kii sajaa hui to vah ayogy ghoshit ho jayega
 But the ordinance provided that the government would not be disqualified if challenged in the Upper Court within 90 days of the sentence
 trial court main doshi hone ke baad tab tak vetan bhatte nahin milenge jab tak upree adaalat bari na kar de
 Till then you can join the proceedings of Parliament but will not have the right to vote

 Uddhav Thackeray is the party chief of Shiv Sena and his marathon interview has started in the party mouthpiece Saamana
 saamana ke kaaryakari sampadak sanjay raut ko die is intervyuu kaa pehla hissaa guuruuvaar ko prakashit hua he
 Uddhav has also regretted getting other parties more important than Shiv Sena
 unhone kaha he ki aao jaao ghar tumhaara jaisi sarkaron kii raajnneeti main shivasena ko koi intrest nahin
 The comments uddhav ko poocha gaya ki chunakar aae saansadon ke mukaable jo ehmiyat shivasena kii rashtriya raajnneeti main honi chahie yah nahin dikhti
 Are you sorry about this? So Uddhav has said, yes

 Uddhav Thackeray has reminded in an interview to Saamna newspaper that Shiv Sena is the oldest partner of NDA
 baaki aate jate rahe hai
 He said on Amit Shah's announcement of 100 percent BJP that BJP runs an alliance with Mufti Mahomed Saeed in Kashmir and here (mumbai) they oppose coalition politics

 tippaniyan Uddhav was asked that compared to the elected mps, it should not be seen in the national politics of Shiv Sena
 is baat par kya aap ko khed he? to uddhav ne kaha he, ji haa
 Whether it is participation in the Council of Ministers or representation on government boards is correct, but we are not greedy for power
 uddhav thakare ne saamana akhbaar ko die intervyuu main yah yaad dilaayaa he ki shivasena endie kii sabase puraani saathi he
 The rest kept on coming
 unhone amit shah kii shat pratishat bhaajapa kii ghoshnaa par kaha he ki bijepi ko kashmir main mufti mahanmad said ke saath gathbandhan chalata he or yahaan (mumbai) ve gathbandhan kii raajnneeti kaa virodh karte hai

 He should compete strongly with Pakistan
 aakhir kashmir main pakistan ke jhande kaise laharaate hai? Uddhav was asked that compared to the elected mps, it should not be seen in the national politics of Shiv Sena
 is baat par kya aap ko khed he? to uddhav ne kaha he, ji haa
 Whether it is participation in the Council of Ministers or representation on government boards is correct, but we are not greedy for power

 ) ek shaks apane mobile main khud apana video shoot karata he
 He says that he can be murdered
 itnaa hi nahin, wo baqayada apane kaatilon ke naam bhi bataata he
 Then a few days later he is literally shot with bullets
 kya aasaan tha police ke liye yah cese?katl ke baad jab police kii tafteesh shuru hoti he, tab saamne aata he wo sach, jisamen pehle shoot or phir shoot kii ek sansanikhej kahani chuphi thi
 This case of murder was absolutely open and shut case because the dying person was told not only about his murder but also the motive of the murder and the name of the killer
 police ke liye isse aasaan cese shaayad hi koi hoga, lekin kahani yaheen nahin khatm hui
 a drunk drunk video says that a dying person never lies, but this person lied
 isaki jaan ko khatra tha, ye to sach he magar koun ise maaregaa ise ye nahin pataa tha
 That is why it took the names of the murderers wrong, that is, in this video it told half truth and half lie
 jis vakt ye video record kar rahaa tha, us vakt isane acchhee khaasi sharaab pi rakhi thi yaa yun kahen ki use pilaa di gai thi or phir usee nashe main isse uske kaatilon ke naam bulawaae gaye
 The plotting of the murder that was hatched by three people was tremendous
 maut se pehle khud ke hi katl kii gavaahi bhi dilava di gai or kaatilon ke naam bhi bulavaa die gaye
 There was no scope for doubt, but when the real truth came out of this video, there was earthquake in Maktool's house itself
 makatool dhiraj kiptnipriti, dhiraj kaa mamera bhai varun he or dilli police kaa purv sipaahi jayadeep in teenon ne hi katl kii sajeesh rachi thi
 These are the three who first made a video recording of the same murder on their mobile with Dheeraj
 kaatilon ke naam bulawaae or phir khud hi katl kar diya
 This story of the wife of a man involved in the conspiracy of murder involved one end of the relationship, the other with the wealth
 bivi apanepatike har raaj se waakif thi
 She was aware of her husband's friend and enemy
 bas isi jaankaree ko jod kar usne sajeesh kaa aisa chakravyuuh rachaa ki pati phir kabhi usase baahar hi nahin nikal paaya
 Dheeraj, a property dealer in Katshahar and a finance business, is shot and killed in his office
 helmet pahane do hamalavar offis main aate hai or kul paanch fire karte hai
 Three bullets hit Dheeraj, while two end to Dheeraj's father Jagveer
 teen goli khaane ke baad bhi dhiraj ladkadaa kar bhaagane kii koshish karata he, magar phir gir padataa he or uski maut ho jaati he, jabaki dhiraj ke pita kii jaan batch jaati he
 After the murder, the wife gave the mobile to the police
 Shortly after this sensational incident, Dheeraj's wife Preeti tells the police that Dheeraj had enmity with many people for the money transaction and he was threatening to kill her
 
 priti police ko dhiraj kaa vomobilebhi detii he, jisamen dhiraj ne khud ke katl or kaatilon ke bare main bataaya tha
 Preeti's relation to her husband's maternal brother, in the initial investigation, the police come to know some such things, which make her suspicious of Preity
 darasal, chaanbin ke dauraan police ko jaankaree milti he ki priti kaa dhiraj ke mamere bhai varun ke saath sambandh tha or ye sambadh pichley saal tab bana jab dhiraj hatya kii koshish ke maamle main aath maheene tak jail main rahaa
 Finally, after confessing to the police, when the police strictly interrogate Preeti and Varun, both of them break up and then tell the whole story
 darasal praparty ke dhandhe ke alaava dhiraj finance kaa bhi kaam karata tha
 He used to raise money at three percent behind and lend it to the people at eight percent
 dilli police kaa purv sipaahi bhi shamildillipulisake purv sipaahi jayadeep ko bhi dhiraj ne kareeb dedh karod rupye die the, magar jayadeep tay vakt par paise nahin lautaa paaya
 There was also a fight between Dheeraj and Jaideep about this
 isi bich jayadeep ko priti or varun ke rishton ke bare main bhi pataa chal gaya kyonki varun dhiraj kaa mamera bhai hone ke saath-saath uske saath kaam bhi karata tha
 At the behest of the constable, Preeti offered Dheeraj a drink after Jaideep entered into an agreement with Varun and Preeti
 usne kaha ki agar teenon mil kar dhiraj ko raste se hataa den, to wo donon shaadi bhi kar lenge or teenon uski jaaydaad ko aadha-aadha baant lenge
 At the behest of Jaideep, Preeti drank Dheeraj one night and got her video recorded on her mobile
 ricarding ke dauraan kaatilon ke taur par jo naam dhiraj se bulawaae gaye, wo log bhi darasal dhiraj se paise kaa len-dein karte the
 Police is on the lookout for the former soldier, then on 26 June Preity called up Varun and Jaideep to call the office
 isi ke baad varun or monu offis ke andar dhiraj ko goli maarthe hai, jabaki jayadeep khud baahar khadaa hota he
 The police have arrested Preeti and Varun
 ab police is sajeesh ke tisare sutaradhar yani dilli police ke purv sipaahi jayadeep or monu kii talash kar rahi he

 ) Looking at the constant obstacles in the journey of Kedarnath, Amarnath and now Kailash Mansarovar, it seems that Lord Shiva is displeased with his devotees
 kedarnath main kudarat kii tabaahi ne kahar machaaya to vahiin amarnath yatra main samay se pehle pigal rahaa shivlinga bhakton kii chintaa kaa kaaran ban gaya he
 And in such a situation, the postponement of the visit of Kailash Mansarovar is making the devotees sad
 kya radd ho jaaegi kailash maansarovar kii yatra?devbhumi uttarakhand main hui tabaahi ke baad ab kailash maansarovar yatra par bhi sankat ke badal mandaraane lage hai
 ITBP in its report sent to the Ministry of Home Affairs has revealed that it is not safe to travel to Kailash
 is report ko aadhaar maanate hue or uttarakhand main jameen dhansane se or baari barish se hui tabaahi ko dekhte hue kailash maansarovar kii yatra philhal agle dedh maheenon ke liye sthagit kar di gai he lekin agar mausam kii maar isi tarah se bani rahi to vaarshik kailash maansarovar yatra ko puri tarah se radd bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 According to ITBP, three bridges under Sobla, Kanjyoti Tawaghat and Elagad, have been washed away
 pithauragarh or kaali nadi ke aasapaas ke pul kii haalat bhi kharaab he aise main yatra ko jari rakhana khatre se khaali nahin hoga
 This year, a total of 18 batches of pilgrims were to visit Lord Shiva situated on the holy Kailash and bathe in the holy lake of Mansarovar, in which only the first batch left
 lekin kharaab mausam ke chalate use bhi 2 din china ke raste main fanse rahanaa padaa
 The journey from the second batch to the 10th batch has been postponed for one and a half months
 kailash maansarovar yatra kii puri jimmedaari itibipi yani bharat-tibet seemaa police kii hoti he jo bhakton ke yatra shuru hone se lekar unke kailash pahunchane tak unke khaane-pine, unki suraksha kii jimmedaari uthaate hai
 But after the devastation in Uttarakhand, ITBP has sent suggestions to the Ministry of Home Affairs
 unhone yahaan ke paidal raaston ko yatriyon kii awajahi ke liye puri tarah se anupyukt bataaya he
 Already the weather in Kedarnath has created a furore and the Shivling is melting prematurely in Amarnath
 aise main kailash maansarovar yatra ko sthagit karne kii khabar ne bhakton ko dukhi kar diya he
 Devotees from other countries visit not only India but also on a visit to Kailash Mansarovar
 or har jatthe ko yatra puri karne main 22 din lagate hai
 Of these, 14 days travel on Indian soil, while the remaining 8 days are spent in Tibet, which is a region of China

 The Explorist HR strap was more luxurious in appearance and was given a stainless steel strap
 haalanki uski keemat bhi thodi zyada thi

 The special thing about the new Fossil Sport is that it is very lightweight and justifies the sporty look
 agar aap ise lagjarius terms main dekhenge to ho saktaa he aapako luk itnaa pasand naa aae, lekin sporti turm main iskaa luk parfect he
 Talking about comfort, the straps are much better and the dial is also quite good
 yani disple ko aap dhoop main bhi aasaani se istemaal kar sakate hai
 There are many options for the watch face as well, so you will not face any problem regarding the look
 buttens bhi kaaphi iji-tu-yuj hai

 parformens and bydaree:explorist HR main snapadragon Wear 2100 procesar kaa istemaal kiya gaya tha
 The new 3100 platform has been used in this new smartwatch
 isamen software part ke liye wearos maujuud he
 Talking about overall performance, it is slightly faster than the previous watch, but still somewhat slow compared to smartwatches like Samsung, Apple and Huawei
 dhyaan rahe itnaa slo bhi nahin he ki aap ise aasaani se acces naa kar saken
 Its UI is improved compared to before, but still not much improvement has been seen in the processor
 aap google assistant yuj karen yaa google feet yuj karnaa chahen
 You will definitely feel a little lag in the overall operation
 yani ye watch smood nahin lagati he
 On one hand, this smartwatch has been launched with a new platform and new OS, but it still needs a lot of work compared to the rival companies
 is watch ke jariye kaaphi function kiye ja sakate hai
 Many things can be done such as sending messages from the watch, taking information from Google Assistant, navigating the map, using the music player and turning on the flashlight
 bydaree kii baat karen to yahaan bhi ye smartwatch pichhali watch kii tulana main zyada behatar nahin kar pai he
 You can only run it for 24 hours
 aise main aapkaa dhyaan khaastaur par fitness ke liye he to kam keemat main Fit Versa Lite jaisi smartwatch kaa ruukh kar sakate hai
 Because there is a battery of up to 4 hours
 faisla:agar aap sirf fitness ke liye watch nahin lenaa chaahate hai to ye aapke liye he
 One of the special things is its premium look and lightweight
 saath hi kai fitures jaise alag-alag watch phase, olves on disple, screen lock, google assistant saport, NFC or google play store bhi ise khaas banaate hai
