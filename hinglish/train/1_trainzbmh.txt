 Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli told the National Defense Force not to participate in the exercise
 unhone kaha ki nepal bimstek sanyukt sainya abhyaas main hissaa nahin legaa
 This is the official statement of the government
 haalanki unhone sainya abhyaas se hatane ke kaarnon kaa khulaasa nahin kiya
 Following the Prime Minister's directive, the Nepalese military leadership had to step back from the first military exercise of BIMSTEC, a regional group formed on India's initiative
 haalanki kaha ja rahaa he ki raajnneetik vivaad ke baad nepali sena ne bharat main hone ja rahe bimstek ke pehle sainya abhyaas main hissaa nahin lene kaa faisla kiya
 On Saturday, media reports said that a political dispute had arisen in the country over the involvement of the Nepalese army in the military exercises of BIMSTEC countries, after which the decision was taken

 The newspaper quoted Oli's press adviser Kundan Aryal as saying, "the government directed the Nepalese Army not to participate in the exercise
" 'ek varisht sainya adhikari ne bataaya ki unhen koi aupchaarik nirdesh praapt nahin hua he, lekin 30 sadasyeey daste ko ravaanaa hone se roak diya gaya

 aligarh muslim uniwarsity ke purv professor mohammad rafique bataate hai, ''aligarh loksabhaa kshetra main kareeb saadhe teen lakh muslim matadaata hai
 In such a situation, the unilateral inclination of Jat and Muslim voters in favor of a candidate can be decisive

 Second, in Agra and Fatehpur Sikri Lok Sabha seats, there was a strategy to prevent Brahmin voters from going to other parties

 The defeat in Chitrakoot is a danger bell for the Shivraj government
 2018 main madhya pradesh main hone vaale vidhansabha chunaav se thik pehle chitrakoot upachunaav ko litmus test ke taur par dekha ja rahaa tha
 The Congress candidate's victory in this by-election with a record 14135 votes could be a cause of concern for the BJP
 shivaraj singh ke saath-saath yogi adityanath ne bhi is seat par jeet ke liye puri takat jhonk rakhi thi
 This defeat of BJP is no less than Sanjeevani for Congress
 vidhansabha chunaav se thik pehle yah jeet congress cader ke liye manovaigyanik badhat hasil kar lene jaisi hi he
 There were two targets, but not to distinguish, just before this by-election, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath also visited Chitrakoot several times
 yogi ke is daure ko siyaasi pandit ek tir se do nishaanaa sadhana maan rahe the
 The first was a by-election to be held here
 doosraa, yogi kaa chitrakoot daura ayodhya ke thik baad tha
 Yogi also took part in the five-km circumambulation of the Kamadgiri temple in Chitrakoot
 yogi ne choti diwali par ayodhya main to ravivaar ko chitrakoot main deepotsav kiya or mandakini kinare mahaarati bhi kii
 It is believed that on the agenda of Hindutva, Yogi is preparing for 2019 by visiting Chitrakoot after Ayodhya, a religious city associated with Lord Rama

 The meaning of this victory also increases because the Gurdaspur seat is considered a BJP stronghold
 vidhansabha chunaav main bhaajapa ko punjab main pehle hi karaari haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 The Vengara assembly seat of Kerala, which also emerged out of hand, also slipped from the bjp's hand in the by-election

 agle chunaav main shivaraj sarkaar ko is ghotaale kaa bhi nuksaan uthaanaa pad saktaa he
 The bypolls to be held in two more assembly seats are still a threat to the BJP

 In Guntakal in Anantapur district in Andhra Pradesh, the police adopted a strange way of teaching a lesson to the four accused of murder
 kaman sanbhali khud anantpur ke guntkal kii dspi i supraja ne
 But in order to teach a lesson, the guardians of the law themselves disguised the law such that the police's behavior has raised many questions
 katl ke aaropee shekhar par apane teen saathiyon somu, pedanna or hossain ke saath milakar apane sasur malaiyya ke katl kaa iljaam he
 In connection with this murder on November 27, the police caught the four and took them to the place of incident
 iske baad dspi ne danda se inaki dhunaai shuru kar di
 The four accused kept falling on their feet
 haath jodakar gidgidaate rahe lekin pulisavaale danda barasaate rahe
 The policemen were so obsessed with teaching the accused a lesson that they forgot the basic lesson of the law
 police ne pehle in aropiyon kaa juluus nikaala
 The police took them from the streets and crowded markets
 aage-aage aaropee or peeche-peeche danda maarthe pulisavaale
 Policemen used to stand at crossroads and beat them with sticks
 phir aage bad jate
 The avenues and intersections were left behind but the process of beating the accused publicly
 dekhte hi dekhte hajaaron logon kii bheed jamaa ho gai
 Nearby houses, shops or like that people stood on every terrace
 bheed juty to vardi waalon ne ise apni takat dikhaane kaa mauka samaj liya
 The police put the accused in a queue and then the real game of breaking the law started
 guntkal kii dspi i supraja ne haathon main danda sambhala or shuru ho gayi
 There was such a tune of raining poles that even Madam seems to have forgotten the count
 police aropiyon ko bich chauraahey par peethti rahi or log tamaasha dekhte rahe
 This behavior of Anantapur police has raised many questions
 kya police surkhiyaan batorne ke chakkar main kanoon bhul gai
 Whether the accused committed the crime or not
 ye tay karnaa or unhen sajaa dena adaalat kaa kaam he phir police ne danda kyon barasaaye?pehla sawaal-kya police ko kisi aaropee ko sajaa dene kaa haq he? kanoon kahata he ki aropiyon ko doshi qaraar dene or sajaa dene kaa haq sirf or sirf adaalat ko he
 Second question - when the court has the right to punish the accused, why did the police beat up the accused publicly? chauthaa sawaal -kya saream danda barasaane vaale pulisavaalon par koi karrwai hogi?aaj tak ne is bare main sawaalon ke ghere main ai guntkal kii dspi i supraja se baat karne kii koshish kii
 But he refused
 police ne beshak chuppi saadh lee ho lekin saream barasaaye gaye dandon ne kuch sawaal khadey kiye hai, or police kii khamoshi inkaa jawaab katai nahin ho sakati
 After handing over the notice of impeachment against CJI Deepak Mishra, the Congress said, "we did not want the day to be seen in the constitutional framework, but in view of our duties towards democracy, we had to submit a notice of impeachment with a heavy heart
" hamen ummid he ki rajyasabha ke sabhapati vekainya naidu is notice par uchit kadam uthaaenge
 Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad said in the press conference that a total of 71 members have signed the impeachment notice, but out of which 7 members have retired
 aise main ab 64 sadsy bache hai
 Which is more than the required number
 ham rajyasabha ke sabhapati vekainya naidu se mili
 About 40 minutes of conversation took place and they have been given notice
 tippaniyan At the same time, Congress leader Kapil Sibal said that CJI Deepak Mishra violated the dignity of his post
 mukhya nyaayadhish kaa pad bahut ahm ohada hota he or sab isaki izzat karte hai, lekin pichley dinon jis tarah se supreme court ke nyaayadhishon ne press vaarta kar karypranali par sawaal uthaae vah durbhagyapurna he
 The judges themselves gave press talks that democracy is in danger and also accused them of playing with the independence of the judiciary
 ve is bare main sijeai se mili bhi 
 However he did not get any success
 press vaarta ke baad se ham chup the or sakaaratmak karrwai kaa intjaar kar rahe the, lekin teen maah biit gaya or koi hal nahin niklaa
 Kapil Sibal said that the Supreme Court's freedom should not be affected
 ham yaa to chup baith kar yah dekhte rahen yaa koi kadam uthaaen
 Now we are doing our duty, but there is no joy in it
 kapil sibbal ne kaha ki notice main sijeai par paanch binduon par sawaal uthaae gaye hai
 Which makes it clear that they have misused the post
 congress netaa gulam nabi aaazaad ne press vaarta main kaha ki mahabhiyog notice par kul 71 sadasyon ne dastakhat kiye hai, lekin isamen se 7 sadsy ritair ho chuke hai
 There are now 64 members left
 jo jaruri sankhya se adhik he
 We met the Chairman of Rajya Sabha, Vekaiah Naidu
 kareeb 40 minute baatcheet hui or unhen notice saunp diya he
 The comments vahiin, congress netaa kapil sibbal ne kaha ki sijeai deepak mishra ne apane pad kii maryaada kaa ulanghan kiya
 The post of Chief Justice is very important and everyone respects it, but the way the Supreme Court judges held press talks in the past and questioned the methodology is unfortunate
 jajon ne khud press vaarta kar kaha ki loktantr khatre main he or unhone nyaaypalika kii swatantraaa se khilwaad kaa aarope bhi lagaaya
 He also met the CJI about this
 haalanki unhen koi safalataa nahin mili
 We were silent and awaited affirmative action after the press conference, but three months passed and no solution was found
 kapil sibbal ne kaha ki supreme court kii swatantraaa par koi aanch nahin aani chahie
 We either sit silently watching it or take some action
 ab ham apana kartavya nibhaa rahe hai, lekin isamen koi khushi nahin he
 Kapil Sibal said that the CJI has been questioned on five points in the notice
 jisase saaf ho jaataa he ki unhone pad kaa durupyog kiya he
 At the same time, Congress leader Kapil Sibal said that CJI Deepak Mishra violated the dignity of his post
 mukhya nyaayadhish kaa pad bahut ahm ohada hota he or sab isaki izzat karte hai, lekin pichley dinon jis tarah se supreme court ke nyaayadhishon ne press vaarta kar karypranali par sawaal uthaae vah durbhagyapurna he
 The judges themselves gave press talks that democracy is in danger and also accused them of playing with the independence of the judiciary
 ve is bare main sijeai se mili bhi 
 However he did not get any success
 press vaarta ke baad se ham chup the or sakaaratmak karrwai kaa intjaar kar rahe the, lekin teen maah biit gaya or koi hal nahin niklaa
 Kapil Sibal said that the Supreme Court's freedom should not be affected
 ham yaa to chup baith kar yah dekhte rahen yaa koi kadam uthaaen
 Now we are doing our duty, but there is no joy in it
 kapil sibbal ne kaha ki notice main sijeai par paanch binduon par sawaal uthaae gaye hai
 Which makes it clear that they have misused the post

 bikaner main 82 saal kii badani devi ke antim sanskaar par hazaron log umad pade hai
 These are all people of Jain society who have come to bid their last farewell to Badni Devi
 yah baat alag he ki aane vaale logon ke liye yah din shok manaane kaa nahin he kyonki vah maanate hai ki darasal badani devi ko mukti mili he
 Badni Devi, who has been sitting on a santhara fast for 50 days, was breathing after drinking only a few spoons of water
 badani devi apane teen bete-bahu or apane poton ke saath bikaner main rahati thim
 In her last days, she had become so weak that she could not even speak
 pachaas din upwas karne ke baad bikaner kii badani devi ne praan tyaag die
 He expressed his desire to take Santhara on 25 July
 parivaar waalon kaa daawa he ki unhone manaa kiya lekin ve santhara lene par adi raheen
 In the Jain community, Santhara is the practice in which a person adopts death by sacrificing food and water
 mana jaataa he ki isse moksh kii prapti hoti he
 After the interim order of the Supreme Court, this first case of killing Santhara came out
 santhara ko lekar vivaad bhi ho gaya tha
 In 2006, a petition was filed against Santhara in the Rajasthan High Court
 is par rajasthan hai court ne agast main aadesh diya tha ki santhara aatmahatya jaisaa he or yah dandaneey aparaadh he
 The Jain community said it was a violation of their religious rights
 rajasthan hai court ke aadesh ke khilaaf jain samudaay supreme court gaya, jahaan se antarim aadesh aayaa ki santhara jari rah sakati he jab tak maamle kii sunwaayee dubaara nahin hoti
 It is worth noting that every year only a few people (not more than a hundred) of Jain society abandon food-water and embrace this fast to embrace death
 jo log aisa karte hai jain samudaay unhen kaaphi sammaan ke saath dekhtaa he
 The comments lekin santhara ke aalochakon kaa kahana he ki ye dharmik pratha kaaphi pichhadi soch dikhaati he or ise ichhamrityu par chalane vaali bahes ke pariprekshya main dekhnaa chahie
 Social activist Nikhil Soni has justified the ban on Santhara, saying that many people in the community hide their carelessness towards the elderly in their homes under the guise of this practice

 It is believed that it leads to salvation
 supreme court ke antarim aadesh ke baad santhara lekar praan tyaagane kaa yah pehla maamla saamne aayaa
 There was also a dispute about Santhara
 san 2006 main santhara ke khilaaf rajasthan hai court main yachika daayar hui thi
 On this, Rajasthan High Court ordered in August that Santhara is like suicide and it is a punishable offense
 jain samudaay ne kaha ki yah unke dharmik adhikaron kaa ulanghan he
 The Jain community went to the Supreme Court against the order of the Rajasthan High Court, from where an interim order came that Santhara could continue until the case is heard again
 gauratlab he ki har saal jain samaaj ke kuch hi log (sau se zyada nahin) ann- jal tyagkar mrityu ko gale lagane ke liye is upwas ko rakhte hai
 The Jain community sees those who do so with great respect
 tippaniyan But Santhara's critics say that this religious practice shows very backward thinking and should be viewed from the perspective of the debate on euthanasia
 saamaajik kaaryakarta nikhil soni ne santhara par pratibandh lagane ko jaays tehraate hue kaha he ki samudaay main kai log apane ghar ke bujurgon ke prati laaparvaahee ko is pratha kii aad main chupa dete hai

 maovadiyon kaa saath dene ke aarope main giraftaar hai gaanv ke 6 yuvakmaovadi ke ek bade hamale main gai thi 15 surakshakarmiyon kii janespi se graminon ne giraftaar yuvakon ko maaf karne kii lagaai guhaarmaharashtra main gatchiroli jile ke kurkheda taluka ke lavari gaanv ne maovadiyon ke ghusane par pratibandh laga diya he
 Explain that the Gadkhirauli district in Kurkheda taluka is considered one of the most affected districts of Maoism
 isi saal gatchiroli zile main suraksha balon par sabase bada maovadi hamalaa hua tha
 The tribal villagers of Lavari have written to the Gadchiroli police requesting them to pardon the six youths who were arrested after the May 1 attack on the police party
 gatchiroli ke kurkheda taluka main 1 may ko IED hamale main QRT ke 15 commando or 1 naagarik maare gaye the
 The IED contained more than 30 kg of explosives
 dhamaake kaa asar kaisaa tha ye isi se pataa chalata he ki jis vaahan par commando savaar the, us vaahan or commando ke sharir ke hisse 800 meter dur tak chhitare paae gaye the
 Apart from Maoist cadres like Narmada, six youths from Lavari village also supported the Maoists in the attack
 in chah yuvakon ko baad main giraftaar kar nyaayik hiraasat main bhej diya gaya
 Lavari villagers handed over letters to SP, Gadchiroli, Shailesh Balakwade on Friday morning and requested to forgive the six youths of the village

 Actor and comedians Kapil Sharma and Ishita Dutt starrer 'firangi' is set for release
 'kis kis ko pyaar karun' ke baad ye kapil kii ye duusari film he
 It is believed that this is an important film in terms of career
 apane duusare filmi project ke dauraan kapil ko bahut saare utaar-chadhaav se guzarana padaa he
 Disputes erupted with old comrades like Sunil Grover, the friendship broke and the pair were known for entertainment, their paths diverged
 jis sho ne kapil ko deshbhar main lokapriy banaaya- bimariyon, vivaad kii vajah se channel ko use band karne kaa faisla lenaa padaa
 Two things are at stake with Firangi - # 1
 acting kariorfirangi kii safalataa bataur actor kapil ke kariyar ke liye bahut mahatvapurn he
 There is no doubt that Kapil has his own popularity, but the box office will decide how much his fans like him for the film apart from TV? However, in his first film, he roasted it fiercely
 'kis kis ko pyaar karun' 2015 main ai unki pehali film thi jo mahaj 8
 5 crores
 trade panditon ke mutabik isane pehle hafte main hi 32 karod se zyada kii kamai kii thi
 There was nothing different in the film
 mana gaya ki kapil kii image kaa phayda film ke bijness ko mila
 # 2
 mekars kaa bharosakareeb do saal baad 'firangi' kii vajah se kapil kasuti par hai
 Even as an actor, Kapil earned tremendous commercial success from the first film, but Bollywood did not take his success that way
 aamtaur par jaisaa duusare abhinaytaon kii safal filmon ke baad dekha jaataa he
 They were not offered pictures of big banners
 jab pehali film hit hone par bhi industry ne unhen zyada tavajjo nahin diya to flop unke filmi kariyar kitna kharaab sabit ho sakati he, ise samajhnaa zyada mushkil nahin 
 Firangi: Must watch Kapil Sharma's film for these 5 reasons? Kapil's film # 1 will prove to be a hit due to these 4 reasons
 kapil kaa desi andaajakapil ke bare main mana jaataa he ki unhone deshbhar ko khulkar hansanaa sikhaaya
 This is true to a large extent which can be understood from the popularity of Kapil's show Comedy Nights and The Kapil Sharma Show
 kapil kii is lokapriyata ke peeche unki kamaal kii hazirajvaabi or desi comic andaaj he
 Seeing most of their jokes, it seems that they are derived from everyday life of rural and small towns
 # 2
 Kapil's fan followingcupil audience mostly consists of middle class people
 kapil rosemara kii jindagi se jokes nikaalkar laate the, jo sidhe taur par audiyans ke saath judata tha
 He has tremendous following in rural areas and urban lower middle class society
 sabase ahm baat yuvaaon main bhi kapil kaa gaharaa prabhaav he
 Evidence of this is the videos associated with his shows on the Internet, which have views in millions of crores
 aaj bhi yuva utyub par kapil ke shoj kii footage dekhakar manoranjan karata he
 Fans would definitely like to see Kapil after a long time
 kapil sharma se yun lipatakar rone laga fain, 'firangi' ne share kii photo # 3
 The entire weekend is empty, Kapil Sharma's Firangi is releasing on Friday, December 1
 pehle is taarikh ko sanjay lila bhansaali kii film padmavati relies hone vaali thi
 Since Padmavati was a big film, many producers and directors did not show interest in releasing their films on a date around it
 vivaadon main funsane ke baad padmavati kii tay relies ruk gai
 Firangi was earlier scheduled to release on November 24, now will come on Padmavati's date
 vaise shuukravaar ko sani leyoni-arbaj khan starer film 'tera intjaar' bhi relies ho rahi he
 But if seen, this is not a film that can challenge Kapil at the box office
 # 4
 Kapil Sharma's image became negative due to Kapil's quarrel with alcoholism and addiction to alcohol
 haalanki, kareeb teen maheene ke baad jab kapil sharma media ke saamne aae to unhone pehali hi mulaakaat main sach ko sweekaara
 He not only accepted the truth but also talked about alcohol addiction and depression
 media ko unhone safai di ki kaise ve sharaab ke aadi ho gaye the
 Had gone into depression due to addiction and was overcome by people
 offis ke kamare main lagaataar band rahane jaisi baat kaa ujagar unhone dikhaane kii koshish kii kahin na kahin ve pareshaan the
 He also set aside many rumors going on in the media with his impunity
 aajkal aisa daur he ki log kalakaar ke munh se sidh uski samasya sunanaa pasand karte hai or usase hamadardi bhi jataate hai
 Kapil's impunity has strengthened his image among administrators
 iskaa phayda firangi ko milane kii ummid he

 shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare ne ise ahankaar par vinamrata kii jeet bataaya he
 Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray in his editorial in Saamna praised the humility of Congress President Rahul Gandhi
 unhone likhaa he ki rahul gandhi ne namrata se jeet ko sweekaar kiya he or bijepi shasit rajyon ke mukhyamantriyon kaa aabhaar jataate hue ghoshnaa kii he ki unke kaam aage lekar jaaenge
 But Modi is not ready to accept the contribution of Pandit Nehru, Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi
 bijepi kaa nirmaan karne vaale adwani bhi unhen manjuur nahin he
 Uddhav further wrote that such arrogance was only seen in Mahabharata, but he was also defeated
 rahul gandhi ne namrata se kaha he ki ham bijepi kaa 2019 main bhi paraabhav karenge
 But BJP will not give the slogan of free India
 itane tufaan main bhi gandhi kyon tike or itnaa ghaav sahakar bhi loktantr nasht kyon nahin hua? iskaa jawaab isi vinamrata main he
 Attacking bjp's slogan of Congress Mukt Bharat, Uddhav said - This victory has thrown the Congress out of the pit of despair
 rahul gandhi kaa congress kaa adhyaksh bananaa matlab mahatma gandhi dwaara congress barkhaastagi kaa sapana puraa karne jaisaa he, aisi tippanee tab modi-shah jaise diggajon se lekar bijepi ke gali-mohallon ke bachche bhi kar rahe the
 His throat got dry by giving the slogan of Congress mukt Bharat and all those who were not tired while paying tribute to the Congress, all of them have suddenly become deaf and dumb
 aapako bataa den ki paanch rajyon main hue vidhansabha chunaav main congress party nemadhya pradesh, chhattisgarh or rajasthan main vaapasi kii he
 After the victory, Congress President Rahul Gandhi while addressing the media thanked the Chief Ministers of all the states for the work done by them for the people of the state

 bharat yatra par aae america ke purv raashtrapati baraak obama ne kaha he ki varsh 2015 main bharat daure ke dauraan unhone dharmik sahishnutaa or dharmik aazaadee ke mudde par pradhanmantri narendra modi se akele main baat kii thi
 To this, Madhav said that Barack should not have made a secret talk with PM Modi public
 aapako bataa den ki baracobamane kaha tha ki varsh 2015 main bharat daure ke dauraan unhone dharmik sahishnutaa or dharmik aazaadee ke mudde par pradhanmantri narendra modi se akele main baat kii thi
 He then said that due to lack of religious freedom, people start seeing differences between each other and the similarities end
 hamen is par dhyaan dene kii jarurat he
 Madhav questioned the same statement and said that Obama should have thought whether it was appropriate to make the private conversation public? Obama should not say that
 bharat ko kis prakaar chalaanaa chahie, yah bharat ke rajaneta or yahaan kii janata jaanati he
 If Obama wants to know, then go to America
 modi sarkaar ne duniya main bharat kaa naam sammaan badhaayaa he
 People of the world today respect India and Indians
 madhav ne kaha ki ham yah sthiti barkaraar rakhane kaa prayaas rakhenge
 Let me tell you that before Ram Madhav was asked the question as to why disputes are being aired on issues like patriotism, Madhav said that his party is not generating controversies
 tivi channel par hone vaale galat dibet sho se in vivaadon ko badhaava miltaa he
 After this Ram Madhav accused the media of airing anti-national subjects or issues questioning patriotism
 ram madhav ne kaha ki rashtrawaad se jude mudde par khuli bahes honi chahie
 There should be an open debate on whether to sing Vande Mataram or not
 madhav ne kaha ki jab media ko in muddon par sahi bahes karne se roka jaae tab virodh hona chahie, lekin abhi vaisaa maahaul nahin he
 Madhav said that we should debate the free flow, let us debate, debate openly
 ram madhav ne left sarkaar par bolte hue kaha ki kerala main vartmaan paristhiti chintajanak he
 Not only this, Ram Madhav also took a dig at Rahul
 unhone kaha ki 20 saal se sadaiv yuva rahane vaale netaa pakistan ko bolne kii jagah apane piem kaa majaak udaate hai
 The opposition is making fun of the Indian government

 However, in India too, in the year 2001, Amitabh Bachchan, Manoj Bajpayee and Raveena Tandonstarr had released a film in which Manoj's character was like a psychotic clown
 unki body language or unke haavbhaav joker se kaaphi milte julate hai
 Like the Joker, it was very difficult to find out about his upcoming bets
 ve jis andaaj main aspataal main jaakar vijayraj ke kairactor ko maarthe he, wo kaaphi had tak joker or harvey dent kii mulaakaat kii yaad dilaate hai
 In this film, Amitabh Bachchan played an honest police officer and Manoj Bajpayee as a vicious and psycho clown
 ek supernatural conection ke chalate donon kii ruh badal jaati he
 Rakesh Omprakash Mehra was doing experiments from his first film itself
 It was Rakesh Omprakash Mehra's first film
 vahi rakesh jinhone aage chalakar rang de basanti or dilli 6 jaisi filmein banaain
 Manoj had already said in one of his interviews that working with Rakesh was as if he was taking us on a new journey of life
 rakesh ne apane tareeke se experimental cinema main apana yogadan dene kii koshish kii thi lekin is film ne box offis par khaas kamaal nahin dikhaaya tha
 However, the film was highly praised by the critics
 isi film ke baad amitabh bachchan ne apni french beards rakhane kaa faisla kiya tha

 In order to increase the Ease of Doing Business, the Central Government has given an exemption in foreign investment policy, as well as an exemption to foreign companies to take a 49 percent stake in the disinvestment of Air India
 ab videshi airline companiyaan air india main apruval root ke tahat hissedari lene ke liye swatantra hai
 Taking further steps in this direction, the central government has approved foreign institutional investors and foreign portfolio investors to invest in the power exchange under the primary market
 kendra sarkaar dwaara yah kadam apni epadiai niti ko saral karte hue desh main videshi nivesh lubhaane ke liye uthaaya gaya he

 The same claim has been made by the Chief Secretary in his FIR, but on the other hand the Aam Aadmi Party says that it is clear from the CCTV footage that the Chief Secretary had gone from the Chief Minister's residence at 11:30 PM, now the question is whether the CCTV Time has been tampered with

 When he came out of the room, only news of his death

 After seeing Sridevi unconscious in the bathtub of the hotel, the same doctor first told that she had died

 There was the marriage of her husband Boney Kapoor's nephew
 shaadi ke baad boni kapur or unki choti beti mumbai laut aae the
 While Sridevi stayed in Dubai

 According to the hotel staff, Sridevi did not leave her hotel room for 48 hours, during which she was continuously alone, while Boney Kapoor moved to Lucknow after returning to India, where the investor summit was held
 lakhanu se laut kar wo phir mumbai aae
 Shetty, a friend of his, was born in Mumbai
 iske baad 24 farvari ko dopaher kii flite se wo waapas dubai jate hai
 Sridevi was not informed of his arrival in Dubai
 der shaam wo hotel pahunch kar shridevi ko sarprise dete hai
 Meanwhile, around the same time, Boney Kapoor's brother Sanjay Kapoor is returning to Mumbai from Dubai
 unki bhi shridevi se koi mulaakaat nahin hoti he
 It is now two stories inside the hotel room
 ek kahani kahati he ki boni kapur pehle hotel pahunchate hai

 phir bhi darwaja nahin khulata to dhakka dekar darwaja kholte hai
 Sridevi lay unconscious in the bathtub inside
 isi ke baad boni kapur pehle apane ek dost or phir police ko phone karte hai
 The second story is that when Sridevi went to the bathroom, Boney Kapoor was not in the hotel
 shridevi ne room sarvice ko phone kar pine kaa pani mangaya tha
 After this she went to the bathroom
 kuch der baad jab hotel kaa staff pani lekar aayaa to kaaphi bel bajaane par bhi jab darwaja nahin khulaa to wo khud hi kamare main aa gaya
 Later, she found Sridevi lying unconscious in the bathtub
 ise baad usee ne pehle hotel or phir police ko isaki khabar di
 However Dubai Police has reported that the cause of Sridevi's death is due to drowning in water
 magar ye aakhri report nahin he
 The Dubai Public Prosecution is investigating the matter, saying that a conclusion can be reached only after the investigation of five things is completed
 police jaananaa chaahati he ki aakhri palon main cameraa number 2201 main hua kya tha?shridevi alcohol khud liya yaa kisi ne jaanboojh kar zyada de di? bathtub main pani labalab kaise bharaa tha? bathtub main shridevi ko behosh dekhne ke baad boni kapur ne police yaa hotel staff ko phone karne kii bajaae apane dost ko sabase pehle phone kyon kiya? haalanki, dubai police shridevi kii maut ko haadasa to bataa rahi he

 In lieu of this, Allah removes Jahannam three trenches from the Talaa Bande, that is, so much has been told about the prayer of each night that the possibility of getting Paradise or Paradise is considered fixed

 20 After the end of Ramadan, the name of worshiping in the mosque night and day apart from worldly life is Etekaf, in which Allah Ta'alaa gave a lot of praise on everything other than prayer, sleeping, waking, reciting Quran, mentioning and praying etc

 ek baar main shivaji park main cricket khel rahaa tha
 i was 12 at the time

 i asked my fellow players if anyone could do wicketkeeping
 koi raji nahin hua ant main main khud wicketcaping karne gaya
 "according to Sachin," i was not comfortable in wicketkeeping and during this time a ball was missed and came quickly towards me
 main kuch riact kar paata usase pehle hi wo mere chehre par lagi
 My eyes were narrowly saved in this incident
 ball se mujhe gahari chot lagi or khun bahane laga
 He further wrote, "I didn't have that much money that i used to go home with a taxi and i was ashamed to even sit in the bus with a bloodied face
 maine apane ek dost se cycle par lift maangi
 Taking me with a cricket kit was not an easy task for him
 east or west bandra ke bich ek fliover he
 Where he could not climb the cycle with me
 vahaan utarkar main paidal chalane laga or log mujhe aashcharya se dekhne lage
 According to Sachin, when i reached home, it was comforting to see that my parents were not at home
 ghar par daadi thim or maine unase kaha ki choti si chot he wo ghar par kisi ko na bataaen
 He told me that i know how to deal with this kind of injury
 unhone meri chot par garm haldi lagaai
 My injury was quickly cured by this grandmother's prescription

 On the 11th anniversary of the attack on Parliament, BJP leaders demanded in the Rajya Sabha that the government clarify its stand regarding the execution of Afzal Guru, the main conspirator of the attack
 shoonyakaal main bhaajapa ke em venkaiya naidu ne kaha ki sansad par hamale kii 11veen barsi he
 Our security personnel and people were killed in this attack
 unhone kaha ki is hamale main afjal guru ko adaalat se doshi tehraaya gaya or maut kii sajaa sunai gai thi jisaki ucchtam nyaayalay ne pushti kii
 Naidu said that the Home Ministry should tell the country what action it is going to take on the order of the Supreme Court
 is par sansadeey kaary mantri kamalnath ne kaha ki vah is maamle main sadan kii bhaawanaaon se grih mantri ko avgat karaayenge
 He said, 'I will request the Home Minister to inform the House about the steps taken by the government in this regard
 ’ isse pehle sadan kii baithak shuru hone par 13 disambar 2001 ko sansad par hue aatankwaadi hamale ke dauraan jaan ganvaane vaale suraksha karmiyon or logon ko shradhanjali di gai
 It has been two months for the lawyers' strike in Rajasthan
 jaahir he, aise main yahaan nyaayik vyavastha charmara gai he
 The constant neglect of clients and the failure of lawyers to bring out any specific corruption against judges has brought their profession into disrepute
 vakeelon or nyaayadhishon ke vivaad main hycourt ne ab sarkaar ko bhi ghaseet liya he, jisase sthiti or naatakeey ho gai he
 Before the case came up again in the Supreme Court, senior advocate Ram Jethmalani has offered arbitration
 baatcheet, apilon or dabaav ke baavjood rajasthan hycourt is gatirodh ko tod paane main naakaam rahaa he
 The strike began when some lawyers felt that a judge had wrongly ordered a vacant rent flat against a lawyer
 in vakeelon main baar association ke adhyaksh bhi shaamil hai
 Ultimately, the said lawyer has to vacate the room but the rest of the lawyers are on strike demanding the transfer of the two judges
 jab hycourt ne sarkari vakeelon ko aadesh diya ki yaa to ve kaam par laut aaen varna apane license radd karaane ko taiyaar ho jaaen, to das atirikt mahadhivaktaaon ne apana istipha de diya
 a day earlier, Justice Govind Mathur of the Jodhpur bench of the High Court had told the Advocates that they should either start working or they would cancel their licenses
 udhar jaipur main nyaayadhish ajay rastogi or je
 K
 ranka ne mukhya sachiv ko talab kar ke poocha ki kya hadataali sarkari vakeelon ko unka vetan mil rahaa he or aakhir sarkaar unka bachaav kyon kar rahi he?hycourt kii is ranneeti kaa parinaam abhi dekha janaa baaki he
 But the number of government lawyers among the striking lawyers is quite small and they will not go against their bar associations
 sarkaar ke paas bhi court ke nirdesh par unka vetan roak dene kaa vikalp maujuud he
 The government has already started the process of appointing government lawyers who do not participate in the strike
 par iske kargar hone kii ummid kam he
 The High Court has so far not involved the Bar Council in the case
 adaalaton ke bheetar sthitiyaan ajeeb hai
 Recently some judges went to jail to get the prisoners bail
 kai vakil apane muvakkilon ko bataa dete hai ki court main apana maamla kaise rakhana he taaki unki namaujuudagi main mukadmaa khaarij na hone paae
 Some lawyers do this free of charge, while cases of overcharging have also come up
 haal ke varsho main hycourt ne vaise hi nammaatr ke bade faisle die hai kyonki uske paas aane vaale maamle kanoon se kam, nijee raahat se zyada jude hote hai
 It is clear that there is no creation of legal discretion in the judicial system
 vahiin baar association aagrahpurn tark rakhte hai yaa hadtaal par chale jate hai
 Now, on this pretext, there is a need to look at the elections of these associations
 vakeelon ko shaayad andaja nahin he ki nyaay ke prati unki vachanabaddhata par sawaal khadey ho rahe hai
 The Supreme Court has also pointed out that this ego fight is doing harm to the lawyer fraternity
 duusari ore jajon ko bhi khud ko dekhnaa hoga ki aakhir itane saare vakil unke khilaaf kyon hai? kuch vakeelon ne india today ko bataaya ki unke jariye jaj rishwat lete hai lekin koi bhi vakil khulkar nahin kahata ki usne kis jaj yaa court ke staff ko koi rishwat di thi
 They are able to tell sporadic cases of personal corruption
 aise main sawaal uthta he ki yadi apane paksh main faisla lene ke liye kisi vakil ne jaj ko rishwat di he to khud vakeelon ne bhi is vyavastha ko bhrasht banane main apana yogadan diya he
 Now the situation is that the court has taken a strong stand and demanded action against the government lawyers
 ab vakil kya karenge? kya ve har us jaj ke tabadale kii maang karenge jo unke khilaaf kadaa nyaayik paksh legaa? sarkaar ko bhi is masale main khinch liya gaya he
 There is no way of ending this strike
 sabase badhibia samaadhaan yahi ho saktaa he ki vakil apni hadtaal khatm karen or apane achche vakeelon ke jariye apni shikayaton ko court ke saamne darj karavaaen

 athavle ne kaha ki pune main hue atyaachaar par piem modi ne kaha tha ki gussa aata he to mujhe goli maaro
 The BJP has also denied Bhima Koregaon and their Chief Minister has also conducted an inquiry
 unhone kaha ki baba ambedkar kii philosphy do samaaj ko ikattha karne kii philosphy he

 But Prime Minister Narendra Modi remains silent
 samay aa gaya he ki centre apni sthiti saaf karen

 jab aam chunaav 2009 main lagaataar duusari baar haar ke baad bijepi andruni jhanjhawaton se jujhate hue shimla main chintan baithak karne ja rahi thi, tab sangh pramukh mohan bhagwat ne party ko naseehat dete hue kaha tha, "bijepi kii kaman yuva peedi ko saunpane kii aavashyaktaa he
 It is a universal truth that the younger generation replaces the older generation and it is up to the BJP to decide whether change can wait till the next generation? "he advocated the leadership of the average age to be 55 to 60 years
 was
 is ranneeti kaa asar sangh-bijepi samet, vishwa hindu parishad jaise sanghathanon par dikhaa, lekin khud teen saal par nagpur main hone vaali sarvocch niti nirdharak sanstha akhil bhartiya pratinidhi sabha kii ahm baithak main sangh khud is naseehat se peeche hataa he
 The Sangh's 'objective policy': Actually, the Sangh has tried to help the Modi government by not giving preference to the younger generation
 sarkarywah pad sangh main muk' kaaryakari kaa hota he or is baat kii purajor charchaa thi ki sah sarkarywah dattatreya hosbale ko is baar sarkarywah banaaya jayega
 But Sarsanghchalak Mohan Bhagwat gave a clear indication of his equation to the Modi government by appointing Bhaiyyaji Joshi for the third consecutive term for the post of Sarkaryavah in place of the young face
 sangh ke ek varisht netaa ke mutabik, "sangh ek matra sanghathan he or sarkarywah pad par badlaav se modi sarkaar ke saamne sangh kaa kad kamjor ho saktaa tha
 "this' provable policy of the Sangh has special significance in terms of age and seniority
 dattatre' hosbale kii umr 59 saal he or ve pradhanmantri narendra modi ke behad kareeb maane jate hai
 If he was made Sarkaryavah, he would have been junior to Modi in terms of seniority
 sangh ke sheersh netaaon kii soch thi ki is badlaav se modi ko sangh par haaavee hone kaa mauka mil jayega or uski bade bhai vaali bhoomika khatm ho jaaegi
 Therefore, the staunch anti-modi faction of the Sangh preferred 67-year-old Bhaiyyaji, who is two years older than the Sangh chief Bhagwat, rather than Hosabale
 haalanki daleel di gai ki bhaiyyaji ne 6 saal main sangh ke vistaar ke liye behatar kaam kiya he or loksabhaa chunaav main bhi sangh ne ahm bhoomika nibhaai, isliye ladaai jitkar turant general nahin badla janaa chahie
 Interestingly, such a statement was made by Hosabale just before the meeting of the House of Representatives
 baithak se pehle hosbale kaa naam hi sarkarywah pad ke liye surkhiyon main tha or sutron ke mutabik, khud bhagwat ne media main badlaav kii aisi khabaron par hairaani bhi jataai
 The Sangh's mutual tussle was also exposed when Bhaiyyaji came face to face with the media after the meeting of the House of Representatives
 unhone hosbale ko lekar puche gaye sawaalon ko taal diya to centre main hue badlaav kaa shrey modi ko dene se parhez karte rahe
 Bhaiyyaji said on the bjp's big win in Lok Sabha, "the people wanted change, so there was a change at the center
 " lekin jab unase poocha gaya ki sangh ise modi kii jeet maanata he yaa nahin, to is sawaal par bhaiyyaji ke saath maujuud akhil bhartiya prachaar pramukh manmohan vaidya ukhd gaye, jo sangh kii aapasi khinchataan kii vajah se sah sarkarywah nahin ban paae
 a temple, a well, a crematorium chief gave a clear message in the House of Representatives that this is the most favorable time for the organization to expand and a special public awareness campaign needs to be carried out for the next three years
 nishchit taur par centre main bijepi kii sarkaar hone kaa phayda sangh apane vistaar ke liye uthaanaa chahta he
 But from the feedback the Sangh has received from all over the country, a message has come out that the society, which is strong among the castes, is coming in its way
 baithak main isko lekar jharkhand, andhra pradesh jaise kuch rajyon main karaae gaye surveykshanon ko bhi rakhaa gaya, jisamen yah akalan tha ki kis tarah jaat-paant sangh ke vistaar main roda bana hua he
 For this, the Sangh has put forward a big agenda, which was laid by Praveen Togadia, International Executive President of VHP in Mumbai during the inauguration ceremony of the Golden Jubilee Celebration of Vishwa Hindu Parishad
 togdipha ne vijan-2025 sheershak se ek prajentation taiyaar kiya tha or bhagwat ke saamne rakhaa tha
 a copy of this is available with India Today
 isamen sabhi hinduon ko apni jati se alag duusari jati main ek hindu paariwarik mitra banane, ek saath bhojan karne, tyohaar manaane or tour par bhi ek saath jane kii salaah di gai he
 Togadia has stated in his presentation that in a village all Hindus should have a well, a temple and a crematorium for water
 pratinidhi sabha ne is vijan-2025 ko sweekaar karte hue sanghathan kaa vistaar karne kii dirghakaalik yojana banaai he
 Not only this, according to the plan of the Sangh, a special strategy has been made to bring the temples under one umbrella and this responsibility has been entrusted to the Vishwa Hindu Parishad to keep the Hindu society united
 lekin sangh kii sheersh body main amuman brahman-baniyaa haaavee rahe hai or is sanghathan ko isi nazariye se hi dekha jaataa rahaa he
 But this is perhaps the first time the Sangh has given 65-year-old V
V
 coming from the Other Backward Classes (OBC)
 bhaagayya ko sah sarkarywah banaaya he
 With this appointment, the Sangh has given a clear message that its campaign is beyond caste and he is raising the slogan - Now leave caste, become Hindu
 isse sangh kaa makasad shakhaon kii sankchaya badhanaa he
 However, in the report of Sarkaryavah at the meeting of the House of Representatives, the Sangh claims that the number of branches has increased by 10,413 in the last three years and now it has reached a total of 55,010 places
 sangh ke tisare sarasanghachaalak balasahab devaras ke janm shatabdi varsh par 2015-16 main sangh ne desh main 50 hajaar jagahon par saamaajik samarasata ke vishesh kaarykram chalaane kaa elaan kiya he
 However, at the meeting, there was also a demand from volunteers to restore the position of spokesperson in the Sangh
 iske peeche daleel di gai ki jis tarah se soshal media or baaki madhyamon kaa bhi prabhaav badha he usase nae-nae mudde saamne aa rahe hai or kai baar swayamsevakon main bhi bhram kii sthiti paidaa ho jaati he
 Therefore, there should be an official spokesperson to clarify the stand of the Sangh
 bhagwat ne is bare main punarvichaar kaa bharosa desh bhar se aae 1,400 pratinidhiyon ko diya
 In this meeting of weak BJP union in up-bihar, the issue of the release of separatists in Jammu and Kashmir was questioned by the volunteers that it is difficult to convince people at the ground level
 sutron ke mutabik, sangh pramukh ne saaf taur se kaha ki anuchhed 370 kaa masalaa sangh ke liye pranavayu rahaa he or isse koi samjhauta nahin kiya jayega
 According to sources, Bhagwat even went on to say, "if the government is deviating from ideology then it is well to get the Sangh to follow it
" " sangh ne is baithak main bijepi ko saaf naseehat di ki dilli se sabak le or bihar-uttar pradesh main sthiti thik kare
 According to the sources, the Sangh has shared the ground report received by the campaigners with the BJP about bihar-up, that at present the party is seen going second in Bihar and third in UP
 lekin sangh-viechpi se jude netaaon kii dharmik bhaawanaaon ko bhadakaane vaale bayanon par bhi sangh pramukh ne nakel kasi he
 The ancillary organizations that have made staunch statements have been clearly told that instead of giving a rude statement, they should stay within their confines and work on the land
 sangh ko ehsaas ho gaya he ki ram mandir kaa mudda ab kargar nahin rahaa
 So after the brainstorm in the House of Representatives, Sarkaryavah Bhaiyyaji said, "ram temple should be built soon, but the matter is before the Supreme Court, so there is no need for any agitation on this issue
 " nishchit taur par yah modi sarkaar ke liye raahat bhari baat he kyonki mandir mudde par sangh ke aanushanbik sanghathanon ke kai netaa 2019 yani modi sarkaar ke pehle kaarykaal main ram mandir ban jane kii baat karte rahe hai
 Apparently the Sangh has given relief to the Modi government
 lekin sangh ko ehsaas he ki loksabhaa chunaav main modi ke netritv main mili badi jeet or modi ke khaas amit shah ke rashtriya adhyaksh banane ke baad bijepi ke saath samanvay ke liye ab sirf sah sarkarywah kii bajaae ek team bana di jaae or bhaiyyaji joshi uski aguwai karen
 With no major changes at the top level in the Sangh, it has become clear that the Sangh is going to dominate the Modi government for at least the next three years

 Rocky Mittal, the publicity advisor to the Haryana government and the director of another reform project, is once again in the limelight for his controversial song
 unhone congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ko janmdin se thik kuch din pehle geet ke jariye nishaanaa banaaya
 The Haryana Congress has been enraged over this song by Rocky Mittal and has opened its front
 haryana congress ne chetavanee di ki agar rocky mittal ne ek hafte ke andar geet main gaae gaye shabdon ko lekar maafee nahin maangi, to rocky mittal ke khilaaf sadakon par utraa jayega or court main manahani kaa mukadmaa bhi daayar kiya jayega
 Actually, this song targets Rahul Gandhi's personal life
 geet main loksabhaa chunaav or amethi se haar ke baad congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi or sonia gandhi ko italy laut jane ko kaha gaya he
 Not only this, Rocky Mittal has also used indecent language for the Gandhi family in his song
 isko lekar ab haryana congress ne rocky mittal ko haryana sarkaar se turant barkhaast karne kii maang kii he
 The Congress has also warned of dragging Rocky Mittal to court for using indecent language for Rahul Gandhi and his family
 haalanki in sab baton se beparwaah rocky mittal ne kaha ki rahul gandhi ek public persenality he
 In such a situation, anyone can comment on them and a leader has no personal life
 uskaa sab kuch saarvajanik hota he
 Rocky Mittal said that if there is anything controversial in his songs and the Haryana government will ask him to resign because of this, he will resign immediately
 unhone kaha ki wo is tarah ke geet apane sarkari kaamkaaj ko nipataakar chuttee ke din yaa phir raat ke vakt taiyaar karte hai or kisi bhi sarkari sansaadhan kaa istemaal in geeton ko taiyaar karne ke liye nahin kiya jaataa he
 Rocky Mittal said that Rahul Gandhi himself has spoken about his resignation
 isi vajah se wo unhen istipha dekar waapas apni nani ke ghar jane kii baat apane geet main kah rahe hai, lekin ishaaron-ishaaron main rocky mittal ne apane dil kii baat bhi kah di ki unhen is baat kii tis he ki modi bhakthi or bijepi kii shaan main geet banane or rahul gandhi samet puure gandhi parivaar ko apane geeton ke madhyam se lagaataar nishaanaa banane ke baavjood loksabhaa chunaav main unako tikat nahin diya gaya
 Now he tries to contest the assembly elections on BJP ticket
 haryana mahila congress kii netaaon ne rahul gandhi ke janmdin ke maukey par kek kaatane ke baad rocky mittal ko haryana sarkaar kaa sarkari selary par rakhaa chhichhora qaraar diya
 He said that if Rocky Mittal did not apologize for this indefinable song within a week, then the Haryana Mahila Congress workers would take to the streets against him and a defamation case would be filed against the Rocky Mittal from the Haryana Congress
 rocky mittal kaa vivaadon main rahanaa or is tarah ke geet bananaa publicity stant bhi he
 For this reason, he openly calls himself a Modi devotee and in his official room, he has put his picture with Prime Minister Modi by writing 'modi devotee Rocky Mittal' behind his official chair, because this is the publicity of Haryana Assembly elections to be held after a few months
 i can also get him a BJP ticket

 The way to power of the country goes through UP and to win UP it is necessary to win Purvanchal
 isi formule se 2014 ke loksabhaa or 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav main upi main sabase zyada siten hasil karne vaali bijepi ab 2019 kii jang fatah karne ke liye purvanchal main paith banane kii koshish main he
 In view of this, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is reaching Azamgarh today on a two-day visit to Purvanchal
 purvanchal ko saadhane ke lihaaj se pradhanmantri narendra modi magahar ke baad ab shanivaar ko sapa ke sangrakshak mulaayam singh yadav ke sansadeey kshetra azamgarh main utrenge
 After this, PM will go to his parliamentary constituency Varanasi, where he will hold a meeting with intellectuals
 ravivaar ko vah mirzapur main logon se samvaad karenge
 During this time he will address three rallies
 lakhanu se gajipur tak saadhane kaa planmodi azamgarh main uttar pradesh sarkaar kii sabase badi pariyojna purvanchal express-ve kaa shilanyas karenge
 This will be the largest expressway in the country
 lakhanu se gajipur tak ke is haive ko agle teen saalon main puraa kar lene kii sarkaar kii yojana he
 There are plans to build an industrial corridor around the express corridor
 purvanchal express-ve gorakhpur elahabaad or bundelkhand ke link express ve se bhi jud jaaenge
 PM will put blue print of this project in front of people
 mana ja rahaa he ki is yojana ke jariye bijepi 2019 kii siyaasi bisaat purvanchal main bichhaayegi
 After the Azamgarh, the gift of Cancer Institute to Varanasi will lay the foundation stone of Homi Bhabha Cancer Institute in Varanasi, its parliamentary constituency
 100 bed kaa ye aspataal mumbai ke tata cancer santhaan ke sahyog se bana he
 Apart from this, he is also under development work under the Namami Gange project and Pt
 madan mohan malviya cancer centre kii maujuuda sthiti kaa jayja lenge
 The Patel community will inaugurate the Bansagar project in Mirzapur on Sunday
 pichley do dashakon se is nahar project par kaam chal rahaa he
 Anupriya Patel, president of Apna Dal, an ally of BJP, is the MP here
 piem mirzapur main ek raily ko sambodhit bhi karenge
 It is believed that through this rally, Modi Patel community and allies will help Apna Dal
 isi hafte bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne mirzapur kaa daura kiya tha
 Did not bloom in Azamgarh, please give the last few days, PM Modi's public meeting was held in Maghar in Sant Kabir Nagar
 is dauraan modi ne sapa or basapa sahit tamaam vipakshi dalon par hamalaa kiya tha
 It is believed that they may give further aggression to this attack in Azamgarh
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main azamgarh purvanchal kii iklauti seat thi, jahaan bijepi nahin jeet saki thi
 Not only this, in the 2017 assembly elections, only one BJP could win out of 10 seats in Azamgarh
 jabaki paanch sapa or 4 basapa ko mili thi
 Prior to PM Modi's visit, BJP President Amit Shah also reached to purvanchal
 shah ne purvanchal main mishan-2019 kaa tanabana vindhyachal dham se bunane kaa aagaaj kiya tha
 Shah had a meeting with the in-charge of 30 Lok Sabha constituencies of Awadh, Kashi and Gorakhpur provinces and tried to understand the pulse of the organization and the people at the grassroots
 upachunaav main bijepi kaa bigadaa samikarngauratalab he ki modi ko satta main aane se rokane ke liye upi main vipakshi dal ekajute ho rahe hai
 In the Gorakhpur and Phulpur Lok Sabha by-elections of Purvanchal, the BJP was troubled by the unity of the SP-BSP
 iske baad vipaksh kii ekta kii takat kii ajamaaish pashchim upi ke kairana main bhi dikhi, jahaan areldi ne bijepi ko shikast di
 Encouraged by the formula of victory in the by-elections, SP, BSP and Congress are planning to enter the 2019 Lok Sabha elections by forming a grand alliance
 teenon dalon ke bich siton ke bantwaare ko lekar manthan jari he
 It is believed that the coordination of seats between the allies of the Grand Alliance will be based on 2009 to a great extent, because in 2014, the opposition was completely demolished
 mahagathbandhan main siton kaa formula2009 ko aadhaar banaaya jayega to teenon hi dalon ke bich jamkar rassakasi hogi, kyonki purvanchal kshetra kii siton ke 2009 ke parinaam par gaur farmaaya jaae to teenon dalon ke bich bahut zyada antar nahin he
 Statistics show that then out of 21, eight seats were won by BSP, 7 by SP and 6 by Congress
 jabaki 2014 kii baat kii jaae to keval sapa ko ek seat mili, wo bhi tab jab khud mulaayam singh azamgarh se maidan main utre
 In such a situation, it will be interesting to see how the seats are aligned between the Congress, SP and BSP, who gets how many seats
 mahagathbandhan se chuta bijepi kaa pasinaa2019 main vipaksh mahagathbandhan banaakar utarataa he, to bijepi ke liye 2014 jaise nattejey doharaana aasaan nahin hoga
 If you leave a seat like Varanasi, then most of the seats in Purvanchal will go out of the hands of the BJP
 bijepi ke haathon se purvanchal khiskaa to phir desh kii satta tak pahunchnaa mushkil ho jayega
 It is very important for the BJP to practice Purvanchal under the political temperament instead of UP
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki piem modi or amit shah pashchimi uttar pradesh ke mukaable purvi uttar pradesh par zyada focus kar rahe hai
 bjp's state unit has been trying to make the atmosphere in its favor by holding Modi's rallies in several districts of Purvanchal
 hryday rogiyon ko raahat dene ke liye sarkaar ne kaha he ki vah stant kii keemat agle 10-15 din main tay karegi

 The meeting of JDU mlas, mps and district officials ended with Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar
 baithak main nitish kumaar ne kaha he ki bhrashtachar par unhone hameshaa jiro tolerance kii niti apanaai he
 Nitish said that if this matter had happened on the leader of his party, he would have taken action by now
 vahiin argedy ne ek baar phir apana stand saaf kar diya he ki tejasvi kisi keemat par istipha nahin denge
 After a 4-day ultimatum, the JDU has given a four-day ultimatum to Lalu Prasad's party
 jediu ne kaha he ki agar chaar din ke bheetar lalu yadav tejasvi ke istife par koi faisla nahin kar pate to phir jediu koi bada elaan kar sakati he
 In the meeting of the other party, Nitish Kumar said in clear words that this matter is related to the other party ie RJD, in such a case, RJD will have to take a decision on Tejashwi's resignation
 safai den tejasvimiting ke baad jediu pravaktaa niraj kumaar ne bataaya ki party tejasvi yadav se aaropon par safai chaahati he
 He said that we will follow coalition religion, but Nitish Kumar works on the policy of zero tolerance on corruption
 unhone kaha ki tejasvi yadav saarvajanik taur par tathy rakhen or apane upar lage aaropon par safai den
 In fact, this big meeting took place after the CBI raids at Lalu Yadav, the chief of the RJD, and deputy CM Tejashwi Yadav, allies in the Bihar government
 sabaki nigahen mahagathbandhan ke bhavishya par tiki hui he
 The RJD refused to resign and the RJD has once again made it clear that it stands on its stand
 argedy ke pradesh adhyaksh ramchandra purve ne kaha ki tejasvi yadav hamaare netaa hai or wo kisi bhi keemat par istipha nahin denge
 No compromise with corruption Before the meeting, Sanjay Jha, close to Nitish Kumar, had said that Nitish has always adopted the policy of zero tolerance on corruption in his political life
 nitish kumaar ne kabhi is niti se samjhauta nahin kiya he
 He said that in the future there will be no compromise with this policy, no matter who the person is
 vahiin nitish sarkaar main mantri jai kumaar singh ne kaha ki baithak main tejasvi yadav kaa mudda bhi uthaaya jayega
 JDU MLA Dadan Pahlavan also said that Nitish Kumar will never compromise on corruption
 somvaar ko hui thi rajd kii baithkisase pehle somvaar ko argedy supremeo lalu prasad yadav ne argedy vidhayakon kii baithak bulaai thi
 It was decided in this meeting that Tejashwi Yadav will not resign
 baithak main raashtrapati chunaavon ko lekar bhi charchaa kii gai
 The current situation in the country was discussed
 nitish kumaar ravivaar ko 4 din baad rajgir se waapas aa gaye
 But due to deteriorating health of Nitish Kumar, the public dialogue program to be held on Monday was postponed
 bataa den ki lalu yadav ke parivaar par lagaataar karpshan ke aarope saamne aa rahe hai
 Tejashwi's name has also come in corruption cases
 in maamalon main sibiai or idi lagaataar chhapemari kar rahi he
 After which the Grand Alliance of jdu-rjd-congress has started appearing in danger
 lalu ke bete or up mukhyamantri tejasvi yadav kaa naam bhi sibiai kii chargeshit main shaamil he
 After which the opposition is adamant on demanding his resignation
 bijepi ke netaa susheel kumaar modi ne kaha he ki tejasvi yadav ke istipha dene se inkaar karne ke baad ab nitish kumaar ke paas ek hi vikalp bachaa he ki ve tejasvi yadav ko apane mantrimandal se barkhaast kar den
 He said that Nitish Kumar used to talk of zero tolerance against corruption
 unhone kaha tha 'mere cabinet main koi daagi nahin rah saktaa he
 i will either stay in Bihar or be corrupt
 'bataa den ki naitikta ke aadhaar par rail durghatana or loksabhaa chunaav main karaari haar ke baad nitish kumaar ne istipha de diya tha
 Due to this, Sushil Modi asked the Chief Minister that 'will this time also they take a decision based on morality and show courage to dismiss Tejasvi?' desh main loksabhaa chunaav nipat gaye hai or agsit pole bhi jari ho chuke hai
 a number of surveys have come together in which nda's overwhelming victory has been assessed
 ajtak- exis maai india ke survey main endie ko adhiktam 365 siten di gai hai
 In such a situation, it is important to know what those issues are, due to which wind seems to be in favor of Narendra Modi and NDA
 1-rashtravadabijapi kattar rashtrawaad kii himachati he
 The BJP seems to consider the issue as a 'soft corner' by opposition parties
 bijepi ke netaaon kii baat karen to narendra modi is mudde ke prakhar vaktaa maane jate hai kyonki unke bayanon or bhaashanon main is baat par zyada jor hota he ki pehle raashtra or baad main party yaa parivaar
 He kept nationalism supreme in his speeches
 2-rashtriya suraksharashtra kii suraksha aantarik khatre se ho yaa bahya chunautiyon se, narendra modi kehete rahe hai ki unki sarkaar ne donon morchon par hindustan ko surakshit banaaya he
 He also included this in his election speeches and emphasized it wherever rallies were held
 aantarik khatre ke mudde par unhone naksalwad or ugravad par lagaam lagane kaa daawa kiya
 According to him, he has worked to convert 'red Corridor' into Green Corridor
 hinsa kaa rasta akhriyaar karne vaale asaamaajik tatwon ko mukhyadhara kii raajnneeti main laane kii ve baat karte rahe hai
 3 - Terrorism terrorism is the name of Pakistan
 narendra modi ke mutabik unhone pakistan ko har morche par alag thalag kar use jataa diya ki vaarta or aatankwaad donon saath- saath nahin
 However, Pakistan was not impressed by this appeal and its terrorist acts continued unabated
 jaisaa ki pradhanmantri apane bhaashanon main bolte rahe hai ki bharat is mudde ko duniya ke kai deshon main le gaya, unhen jataa diya ki pakistan na sirf dakshin asia kii shanti ke liye khatra he balki samgr duniya iske hinsak radar par he
 4- The issue of Hindutva Hinduism is also like nationalism towards which other parties appear to be adopting 'soft approach' but the BJP has been vocal on this
 tabhi ram mandir or uniform civil code kii baat hoti rahi he
 Although Narendra Modi has refrained from speaking openly on this issue, his rites of worship duly at the Kashi Vishwanath temple in Varanasi and more recently at kedarnath-badrinath show that the issue which other parties are likely to pursue during the election season BJP has gone far ahead
 5-swatchta abhiyaanis chunaav main agar koi mudda sabase zyada uthaaya gaya to vah he swatchta abhiyaan
 The Prime Minister mentioned this in every speeches and explained how his government is different from other governments
 unhone bataaya ki gandagi or mailaapan kaa asar hamaare upar, aas pados tak hi nahin padataa balki duniya main bhi isse chhavi dhoomil hoti he
 For this, he promised to create an open defecation free India
 iske liye shauchalay nirmaan ke abhiyaan chalaae gaye or jaisaa ki pradhanmantri apane bhaashanon main is abhiyaan ko shat-pratishat safal banane kaa daawa karte dikhte hai, isse kaha ja saktaa he ki ye mudda unki jeet main mahati yogadan nibhaa saktaa he
 6-ayushman Bharat yojanabjp and Narendra Modi call this scheme a new revolution
 unka maananaa he ki yah duniya kii sabase badi swasthya suraksha yojana he
 It is heard in his speeches that it is such a wonderful scheme for the poor that crores of families of the country are benefiting and will be in the future
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne jharkhand kii rajdhani ranchi main ayushmaan bharat ke tahat pradhanmantri jan aarogy yojana (abi-piemjeevai) kaa shubharambh kiya tha
 The government claims that Ayushman Bharat is the first such scheme in the world, under which more than 50 crore people will get insurance of up to five lakh rupees
 nimna madhyam varg kii 40 pratishat aabaadi ko laabh dene kii baat ho rahi he
 7-ujjwala Scheme This scheme is one of the many ambitious schemes of the Narendra Modi government
 iske tahat garib pariwaron ko muft alpiji conection dene kaa prabandh he
 Previously, to prepare food, hard work had to be done in the system of wood, cow dung etc
 which took a lot of time and effort
 lakdi or upalon se nikalne vaale dhuna se puure parivaar ke swasthya main bura asar padataa tha
 Now the poor families get gas stove, the food and the dishes of the children's favorite are made quickly
 swasthya kaa bhi khyaal ho jaataa he
 Many such things have been raised by the Prime Minister in the program of Mann Ki Baat
 8-bhrashtacharabijepi or narendra modi ke liye bhrashtachar sabase bada mudda rahaa
 Narendra Modi always kept saying that his government was different from the previous governments because no minister or leader was accused of irregularities
 narendra modi apane bhaashanon main congress ke kai bhrashtachar kaa zikr karte hai jisamen boforce, 2ji se lekar kaamanwealth ghotaale tak kii baat he
 At the end of the election campaign, he called former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi to 'corrupt number 1', which caused a lot of uproar
 haalanki congress ne boforce ke jawaab main rafel saude kaa mudda uthaaya or apane prachaar ke mukhya bindu ke taur par pesh kiya
 Rahul Gandhi gave the slogan 'chowkidar Chor Hai' and around it he continued to call the Narendra Modi government 'corrupt'
 rahul gandhi ke 'chaukeedaar' ko narendra modi ne suavasar ke taur par liya or iske jawaab main unhone 'main bhi hum chaukeedaar' abhiyaan chalaaya
 According to BJP, this campaign was successful, which benefited him in the form of votes
 9-'mahamilavati netaa'pradhanmantri narendra modi apane bhaashanon main 'mahamilavati netaaon' kaa zikr karte sune gaye
 He told that opposition leaders have united to remove the BJP government from the Center and defeat Narendra Modi
 inke bare main unhone kaha ki jo netaa ek duusare ko koste rahete the, ve ab unhen haraane ke liye ek ho gaye hai
 Prime Minister Modi said that the leaders who have been accused of corruption, who have been promoting dynasty, who are on bail, who want to get power in any case, all the leaders have united to defeat them
 pradhanmantri ke mutabik, ek taraf puraa vipaksh he to duusari ore akele modi
 10-good Governance Prime Minister Narendra Modi gave the slogan of Good Governance
 jaisaa ki 17 may ko khargon main pradhanmantri ne kaha, mujhe prasannataa he ki desh kii janata rashtrabhakti kii prerana, antyoday ke darshan or sushasan ke mantra ko lekar chal rahi or bijepi ke prati apana vishwaas prakat kar rahi he
 The commitment to end terrorism and Naxalism is getting full support from the people
 desh kii bhaavana he ki aatankiyon ko ghar main ghuskar maaraa jaae
 The Prime Minister connected the issue of Good Governance to the birthday of Atal Bihari Vajpayee and started a ceremony to celebrate Good Governance Day on 25 December
 har saal 25 disambar ko puure bharat main yah diwas manaaya jaataa he
 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said that India will overtake Britain by next year to become the fifth largest economy in the world and will be one of the world's three largest economies by 2040
 haalanki jetali ne kaha ki bharat kii prati vyakti aay kam bani rahegi lekin arthvyavastha kaa aakaar vishaal he or tej gati se aage bad rahaa he
 On the inauguration of the new building of the Competition Commission of India (CCI), Jaitley said, this year, the Indian economy overtook France by size
 vahiin agle saal ham britain ko pachhad denge
 In this sense, we will become the fifth largest economy
 jetali ne kaha ki duniya main anya arthvyavasthaaen bharat ke mukaable bahut dhimi gati se bad rahi hai
 If we grow at an average of seven to eight percent, then it will not take long to overtake these economies, which are growing at the rate of one to one and a half percent
 is lihaaj se yadi ham 2040 tak dekhte hai, to vishwa main aakaar ke maamle main bharat teesri sabase badi arthvyavastha ke taur par ubharegaa
 He said, our population is more, our consumer base is huge, the size of the economy and its capacity are also going to be huge and hence the markets are going to be huge
 or agar bazaar vishaal hai, to ham nishchit rup se asaadhaaran honge or iske liye aavashyak kadam uthaane kii jarurat he

 unhone kaha, ‘tii20 main bharat kaa pakistan ke khilaaf record badhiya he
 On your home ground, where the atmosphere is known, the expectations are high

 newjiland ne yahaan spin leti viketon par acchhee cricket kheli

 washington sthit prakhyat america vichaar samooh ‘council on fahrren rilations’ dwaara yojit ek goshtee main manter ne kaha, navaj ke saath sakaaratmak tareeke se kaam karte hue pakistani sena in ashankaon ko dur karne ke liye kadam uthaa sakati he
 He said, but i think that unless (sharif and Sena) take a comprehensive initiative towards India, there can be limits for them
 manter aktubar 2010 se july 2012 tak islamabad main america rajdoot the
 It was a period when the bilateral relations of the two countries were severely jolted due to some incidents such as the Raymond Davis case, the killing of Osama bin Laden in Abbottabad and the death of 26 Pakistani soldiers in a cross-border attack by US forces
 islamabad main pravaas ke dauraan manter ne lahore main kai baar sharif bandhuon se mulaakaat kii thi
 Manter said, "whenever i spoke to Nawaz and his brother Shahbaz, every time there were talks between the two countries about the improvement in the visa process and the ability to carry goods across the border and the economic impact of the steps taken in this regard was good
" Kind attention was given
 unhone kaha, mujhe lagata he ki navaj iske bade samarthak hai
 By the way, the important question will be how right now Nawaz needs to build a relationship with the army
 ‘council on fahrren rilations’ main bharat, pakistan or dakshin asia ke liye varisht phelo danniel marki ne kaha ki navaj sharif, unke sattarudh gathbandhan or unki party ko do alag-alag dishaao main khinchaa ja rahaa he
 The comments unke anusaar, ek ore to vah bharat ke saath rishte sudhaarney, bharat ke saath sthirataa or bharat ke saath vyapaar chaalu karne kii baat karte hai
 This is the positive side of Nawaz and his party
 unhone kaha, vahiin duusari ore sharif punjab main kuch kathor vichaardhaara vaale sanghathanon se jude hai
 In such a situation, the question arises whether he will really try to deal with the problems arising due to jamaat-ud-dawa, lashkar-e-taiba or will he overcome his image of 1990s when he did nuclear test
 Was inserted america visheshgy ne kaha, vah ek baar main yah donon baton ko kaise kar paaenge

 Today 24 Janavari Ratri ८ Vajata Chhatriwali Fakt Star Pravah Var # Chhatriwali # starpravaha post shared bystar Pravah (@star_pravah) onjan 26, 2019 at 1: unhone big bos 12 kii vinar deepika kakkad ko sho kaa vijeta maanane se bhi inkaar kar diya tha
 This was the reason that Deepika's fans trolled Shilpa fiercely
 shilpa in sab baton se pareshaan hokar apana instagram acount bhi delit kar chuki hai
 Sonam Kapoor, daughter of Bollywood actress and Anil Kapoor, is getting married to Delhi businessman Anand Ahuja on 8 May
 pichley chah maheene main yah doosraa mauka hoga jab koi bollywood abhinetri apane kariyar ke peak main shaadi kar rahi he
 In December 2017, Anushka Sharma was pompous with cricketer Virat Kohli
 deepika padukon bhi lambey vakt se ranvir singh ko date karne ke baad saal ke ant tak shaadi kar sakati hai
 The three actresses are between 30 and 32 years old
 shuru main do-teen heroinon ne glamer world main shoharat kii bulandi par shaadi kaa faisla liya or filmein bhi karti raheen
 The new tradition started by Kajol just one year before the Millennium Year, this change in Bollywood seems to be strengthening after the marriage of Kareena Kapoor Khan in 2012
 relationships yaa liv in ab bollywood ke liye ek aam baat he
 This change is interesting because it did not appear before 2000
 shaadi to dur kii baat, abhinetriyaan apane afaire tak chhipaati thim
 There were several reasons for this, says senior film critic Ajay Brahmatmaj
 dharre kii filmein or darshakon kaa apana puraatan khyaal
 Heroines were not considered worthy of a central role in films after first getting married or crossing the age of 40
 tab unke hisse maa, bahan yaa duusari charitra bhoomikaayen aati thim
 Bollywood has a lot of good actresses who had to leave movies after marriage
 kapur family kaa elaan- 8 may ko hogi sonam kapur kii shadifilm sameekshak or trade analist komal nahata kehete hai, us daur main (2000 se pehle) ection, family drama yaa romantic filmein bana karti thim
 Heroines here were mostly show pieces
 tab is tarah kii soch bhi thi ki filmon main shaadishuda heroinon ko dekhnaa darshak pasand nahin karenge
 But now it is not so
 socity main badlaav kaa asar filmon main bhi najar aa rahaa he
 Now the age of heroines or their married life is not a taboo
 komal ne mutabik pichley do dashak main jis tarah samaaj main varking vumans kaa ubhaar hua he, filmon par bhi uskaa asar padaa he
 People's thinking has changed
 kabhi ye ek pravriti thi, par ab ye koi masalaa nahin he
 Ajay also sees the weight behind this change in the film characters of the heroines in the last 17-18 years
 unke mutabik, 2000 ke baad kii filmi kahaniyaan zyada majboot hui hai
 Film characters have become more important than glamor
 abhinetriyaan bhi kathanak ke centre main ai hai
 The special thing is that now the audience group has also changed
 komal kii najar main - ab ke darshak kii range zyada badi he
 He does not just want to see action or hero-heroine romance stories
 isi badale trend kii vajah se pichley kuch saalon main ection or family drama banani kam hui hai
 Now all kinds of films are being made
 kyonki audiyans sab tarah kii, lekin acchhee filmein dekhnaa chahta he
 It is from this trend that the film character of women has gained prominence
 ab jo filmein aa rahi hai usamen mahilaon ke kirdaar sho pis bhar nahin hai
 Cinema is in an era where the age of the heroines or their marital status is of no importance
 is diziner kii dress pahanakar dulhan banengi sonam kapur!komal kehete hai yahi vajah he ki pichley 10 se 15 saalon main bollywood ne alag-alag vishyon par filmein banaai hai
 Among these films, aged or married heroines have given big hits like Maa (sridevi), Tumha Sulu (vidya Balan), Hichki (rani Mukherjee)
 shaadi ke baad bhi saxesphul he in heroinon kaa kariyar # 1
 Kajol: This trend started in Bollywood just before 2000
 tab 1999 main saxesphul kariyar kii peak main kaajol ne ajay devgan ke saath shaadi karne kaa faisla kiya tha
 However, she continued to work in films even after marriage and as an actress Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gum, Fana, My Name Is Khan, You Me and Hum, Dilwale
 wo philhal 'ila' main vyast hai
 # 2
 aishwarya raay:2007 main abhishek bachchan ke saath shaadi kar liya tha
 They also have a daughter
 shaadi or maa banane ke baavjood aishwarya lagaataar filmon main vyast hai
 After marriage, he gave films like Jodha Akbar, Guzaarish, Jajba, Ae Dil Hai Mushkil
 # 3
 Kareena Kapoor Khan: Kareena Kapoor also married Saif in 2012
 taimur ko janm dene ke baad mahila kendrit unki film veere di wedding aa rahi he
 Earlier, many films like Satyagraha, Singham Returns, Gabbar Is Back, Bajrangi Bhai Jan and Udta Punjab were released
 # 4
 Vidya Balan: also married Siddharth Roy Kapoor in 2012
 shaadi ke baad unhone ghanchakkar, shaadi ke said effect, bobi jasoos, hamaari adhuri kahani, kahani 2, begum jaan, tumhaari sulu jaisi filmein di
 # 5

 Dear young friends and friends, a letter or leaflet must have come to you at some time
 aapke paas nahin aayaa hoga to aapke priy dost athwa padosi ko to nishchit taur par mila hoga
 When this type of letter or leaflet comes in hand, you may be thinking for a few moments
 patr main die aadesh kaa paalan, bataai gai kriti kyon na karuun, yah duvidha aapke bhi man main ho gai hogi
 Then what would have happened to you and everyone around you? 'don't risk unnecessarily
 vaise is patr main sachai hogi hi nahin
 
 
 Has this ever happened? But what happened to anyone? If it happened on its own 
 
 ? bhalaai isamen hi he ki praapt patr kii gyaarah athwa ikkis sankhya main nakal ho or aisi hi paanch sau athwa ek hazaar kapiyaan chhapavakar baant den
 Meaning even if you say 'no' by mistake, Brahman should not be killed

 Greed or panic is almost the same

 So take appropriate decisions and be pleasant

 When she went to her school, she showed seriousness and some fear on the faces of the children
 usne baat kii tah tak jane ke liye samvaad armbh kiya
 Children became normal
 pandraa-bees bacchon ne baste se santoshi mata kaa card baahar nikaala
 Gautami remembered that he too had received a similar letter a day or two ago and that is what he had in his purse
 usne bhi apana patr baahar nikaala
 The threat of the letter was forged
 patr ke aadesh kaa paalan na karanevaale vyakti kii uske bacchon ke saath pandraa din ke andar mrityu hogi is prakaar dhamkaaya gaya tha
 Some parents felt that the administration of the school should take some decision in this regard
 kuch abhibhavakon ne patr bhi likh die the
 Now everyone was intrigued about what the teacher says
 gautami ko aayaa hua patr teble par hi padaa hua tha
 Now everyone was paying attention to what the teacher says
 gautami ne patr haath main liya or bina bole uske do tukde kar die
 Then cut it into small pieces and put it in the trash can
 kuch aghatit hi hua
 Students were stunned
 teacher ne itnaa hi kaha, "prastut patr ke aashay ke anusaar aanevaale pandraa dinon main meraa or mere bacchon kaa aayush khatm hona chahie
 i will come to school every day, take care
 " phir bhi bacchon ke man main khuf paidaa hua hi
 In the next fifteen days from Duryoga, Gautami got a fever
 doctor ne salaah di ki skool mat jaaie
 There is a lot of fever
 lekin gautami kaa aagrah isliye tha ki use bacchon ke man kii ashanka khatm kerani thi
 Gautami went to school in Bukhar too
 usne padhaayaa
 When fifteen days were over, she also took the children along and put an 'aankh Dekha Hall' in front of everything to be efficient
 uske baad karishma hi hua
 Many children took out the cards from their bags
 unke tukade-tukde kar die or kaksha se baahar phenk die
 Social reformer Gopal Ganesh Agarkar had said a hundred years ago, "only the growth of knowledge will not go, accordingly the courage to behave should also increase
