 Satish Upadhyay said that Arvind Kejriwal has supported black money, while people are supporting demonetisation in protest against black money
 isiilie dilli kii janata ne kejariwal ko nakaar diya he
 Satish Upadhyay said that by opposing Kinotbandi, Kejriwal has told that his fight against corruption was merely a show-off and he is standing in support of those who collect black money, not to end corruption

 Upadhyay congratulated and thanked the merchants and the shopkeepers, as well as claimed that the trust of the traders and common people of Delhi has now lost their trust from Kejriwal

 But on the eighth day of the swearing in, Munde's accidental death in a road accident has stressed Modi and bjp's muscle
 ek varisht kendriya mantri kehete hai, ''munde ko mukhyamantri ke rup main project karne kii disha main teji se sochaa ja rahaa tha, par nirnay nahin hua tha

 Priyanka Brahmastraj will not run in UP, when Sheila Dixit became the CM candidate of UP, she said that the coming of Priyanka Vadra will strengthen the Congress in UP
 haalanki, wo kab aaengi ye faisalaa wo khud karengi
 But, in the changing political equation, the Congress campaign seems to be slowing down
 aise main congress alaakaman bhi priyanka par chuppi saadhe he, jiske chalate pike ki planning gadabada gai he
 PK wanted Priyanka to be the face of UP, but the Congress party wants to play their trump aces with thought

 That is why i do not want to open my cards so soon, but the pictures of Mulayam Singh and then Akhilesh Yadav meeting for PK left the activists in UP confused

 The arrow of the 'bloodshed' broke upside down, the election campaign of the Congress, which is looking for a return to power in UP, is hanging in the balance

 If Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP President Amit Shah look back on 2014, then they can say that it has been a year of miracles for them and it is impossible to keep them deprived of this happiness
 loksabhaa main spasht bahumat paane ke saath-saath bijepi na sirf maharashtra, haryana or jharkhand kii satta par kabiz hui, balki jammu-kashmir main bhi vot pratishat ke hisaab se sabase badi party banakar ubhari
 To his delight, it was with the fact that the Congress was reduced to the lowest number in the Lok Sabha and could not even finish second in the 2014 assembly elections
 is tarah ‘‘congress mukt bharat’’ kaa modi kaa chunavi naaraa hakeekat main utarataa dikhaa
 It is no longer a surprise that Modi's popularity is at the heart of this BJP boom and heights
 pradhanmantri banane ke baad ve chunavi rajyon main prachaar or videshi rajdhaniyon main desh kii baat ek hi swar main karte rahe
 But with the election results coming from Ranchi, Jammu and Srinagar, the party has come to understand the truth that Modi wave also has a limit
 agar isi pyaale ko aadha khaali maanakar dekha jaae to bijepi ne bamushkil jharkhand main bahumat kaa aankada paar kiya he or kashmir ghati tathaa ladakh main to ji-jaan se ladgaye ke baad bhi vah khaataa tak nahin khol pai
 what does this mean? People within the party and political experts believe that even after the general election results on May 16, the bjp's campaigning in the states has remained the same
 yani vipaksh par joardaar waar karo, modi or bijepi ko satta se bahari ke rup main pesh karke logon main sushasan kii ummid jagaao
 But now it can soon be realized that BJP is sitting on the throne of Delhi
 phir iske saath hi use sarkaar virdohi bhaawanaaon kaa bhi saamana karnaa pad saktaa he
 Perhaps cautious of this realization, BJP leaders are accusing the opposition that it is raising issues like proselytism to divert public attention from governance and development and obstructing Parliament and not allowing major bills to be passed
 
 sansadeey kaary mantri venkaiya naidu kehete hai, ‘‘vipaksh asal main sansad main gatirodh paidaa karke sarkaar ke vikaas agenda main fachchar fansaane kii koshish kar rahaa he jisase vikaas ke liye behad jaruri kai vidheyakon kii raah main rukaawat paidaa kii gai
 The opposition wants to limit the government's options in the next budget
 ’’party ke andruni sutron kaa yah bhi kahana he ki jharkhand tathaa jammu-kashmir ke nateezon ne saaf kar diya he ki in rajyon main bijepi ne apane virodhiyon kii takat ko kam karke aanka
 "the performance of the Congress has not been as bad as we had expected," says a senior BJP leader
 neshnal conference bhi is lahar main bah nahin gai
 According to him, the party feels that in Jammu and Kashmir it got at least five seats less than expected
 jharkhand main jharkhand mukti morcha (jeemem) chunauti banakar ubhara
 He increased his seats despite being in government and anti-government sentiments
 dilli or bihar main 2015 ke chunaav se pehle bijepi ke liye ye ankhen kholane vaale sabak hai
 It is also clear from the indication of party president Amit Shah joining hands with the People's Democratic Party (PDP) or National Conference (NC) in Kashmir that the party has decided on the strategy of Ekla Chalo in Haryana and Maharashtra
 baharhaal, isse duusare rajyon main bijepi ke maujuuda sahyogiyon kaa ashankit hona swaabhaavik he, kyonki party kaa avasarwaadi rujhaan ab spasht hone laga he
 In order to fulfill the desire to paint the entire country in saffron, BJP needs allies in Tamil Nadu, Odisha and perhaps West Bengal too
 isliye use shaayad endie-1 ke safal anubhav se sabak lete hue gathbandhanon kii ekarup niti apnaani hogi tathaa sahyogiyon ke prati sammaan or udaartaa kaa pradarshan karnaa hoga, jaisaa ki usne atal bihari vaajapeyi ke daur main kiya tha
 There is no doubt that after the drunken 2014 victory and the completion of the one-year rule, Modi and Shah will have to return to Corey Sullet and revisit their electoral strategy

 Although there is a difference in sex ratio across Uttar Pradesh, the crisis in Agra has increased so much that the brides have become a crisis for the youth
 is samasya ke kai gambhir parinaam aane vaale samay main uttar pradesh ke samaaj ko jhelane pad sakate hai
 This will make it even harder to stop the crimes rising in the society
 agra main halaat sabase gambhir dikhaai de rahe hai, jahaan samuhik vivaah kaaryakramon main, vivaah se pehle hone vaale parichay sammelnon main chaar ladakon par ek ladki hi mil rahi he
 The lack of brides has increased so much that mass marriage among various castes is increasing in this area
 samaaroh karwaane waalon ke mutabik saat-aath saal pehle tak aisi samasya nahin hoti thi
 Then the number of girls was more and the number of boys was less
 is saal july tak maathur vaisya, brahman, punjabi, kshatreey samet kai jatiyon ne alag-alag aath samuhik parichay or vivaah sammelan karwaae
 Three thousand youths and only one thousand women were involved in them
 maathur vaisya mahasabha bhawan, pachkuiyaan par hue varshney samaaj ke parichay sammelan main 115 yuvatiyon ke panjiyan hue the
 The number of youths was 467

 In the year 2001, this ratio was 846
 keval agra shahar main 2001 main mahilaon kii sankhya 851 thi, jo 2011 main badhkar 857 ho gai he
 Some social experts believe that this sex ratio is natural
 unka kahana he ki samaaj main abhi bhi jis tarah ladke-ladakiyon main antar kii bhaavana he, uske kaaran ek samasya yah bhi hogi
 Under this, boys will have trouble in marriage
 saath hi jab samaaj main purushon kii sankhya mahilaon se zyada hogi to is kami ke chalate samaaj main aparaadh kii sankhya badhegi

 somvaar ko bharat band ke dauraan bhi yahi hua
 The Battle of Haq took a violent form and 10 innocents lost their lives
 lekin sawaal ye ki aakhir 10 mauton kaa mujrim koun he?deshbhar main jo tandav machaa usamen sabase zyada maut madhya pradesh main huin
 Where seven people lost their lives due to the fire of Dalit law
 upi ke firozabad main bhi pradarshan ke dauraan ek kii maut hui
 Violent protests in Rajasthan and Hajipur in Bihar killed an innocent
 in sawaalon ke jawaab koun degaakhir sab kuch pataa hote hue aise halaat paidaa kyon hone die gaye?desh kii supreme court ne essi / asti act main badlaav vaala faisla beete 20 march ko sunaaya tha
 Justice AK Goel and Justice U
 you lalit ne ye faisla diya tha
 Since then, there was protest against this decision of the court in the Dalit society
 samvidhan bachaao sangharsh samiti ke netritv main dalit samaaj ke log desh ke alag-alag hisson main dharne-pradarshan kar rahe the
 After which Bharat Bandh was called on 2 April
 prashasan ko isaki puri jaankaree thi
 The Punjab government also made claims of security and also canceled the examination of precautionary children
 lekin somvaar ko jab virodh main dalit samaaj sadakon par utraa to punjab se lekar rajasthan, madhyapradesh, bihar or upi jang kaa maidan ban gaya
 Why rioters were allowed to openly commit violence on the street? Dalit population is around 17% in the country
 tamaam dalit sanghathanon samet raajnneeti dalon ne bhi is band ko samarthan kaa elaan kiya tha
 Due to which it was decided that a large number of people would go into protest
 is tarah hi bheed main apriy ghatana hone kii bhi ashanka rahati he or rajya sarkaron ke saath police-prashasan isse acchhee tarah waakif hoga
 But when the protesters came out on Monday morning, they made a fierce orgy and the police who stopped them were seen only in a few places
 kya sarkaar kii police or surakshabal hinsak bheed ke aage kam pad gaye?kanoon-vyavastha rajya sarkaron kaa vishay hota he, aise main bharat band kaa shantipurna tareeke se samaapan bhi unheen kii jimmedaari thi
 Apart from the Central Intelligence Department, the state government has its own intelligence system in the form of LIU
 aise main is baat se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa ki sarkaron ko isaki khabar na rahi ho ki bharat band ke dauraan kahaan-kahaan or kitni taadaad main log jamaa ho sakate hai
 Despite this, in the pictures that came out, the police appeared helpless in front of the violent crowd
 sadakon par police se kahin zyada bheed najar ai
 Police stations were targeted
 pulicekarmiyon par patharbaji kii gai
 After the violence erupted across the country, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh promised the state governments all help
 aise main agar pehle se hi kendriya force rajya sarkaron ko muhaiyaa karai jaati to mumkin he aaj tasviir kuch or hi hoti
 Was the politics behind the violent protests of these organizations? Supporters of Bharat Bandh have been claiming since Monday that this movement was made violent to discredit Dalits
 kai jagah se is hinsa main raajnneetik logon ke shaamil hone kii bhi khabaren ai hai
 a senior police officer in Meerut has publicly stated that behind the violence in the city is a conspiracy by a leader, a former Bahujan Samaj Party MLA
 philhal, bispi ke purv vidhayak yogesh verma ko giraftaar kar liya gaya he
 The biggest and final question is who is responsible for the deaths of 10 innocent people
 kyonki kanoon main badlaav ke khilaaf log sadakon par utre
 The crowd created a furore
 police par hamalaa kiya gaya
 Police lathi-charged
 firing bhi kii
 In this whole struggle 10 lives were lost
 ab sawaal he ki firing karne vaali police jimmedaar he yaa kanoon-vyavastha na sambhaal paane vaali rajya sarkarein yaa phir deree se punarvichaar yachika daayar karne vaali centre sarkaar yaa phir apane haq kii ladaai ke liye pradarshan karne utre daliton ko hinsa ke liye uksaane vaale raajnneeti chamakaane vaale netaa

 jabaki punjab main congress satta main he
 Especially in MP, Rajasthan and UP an open game of violence was seen

 hallaa he ki manmohan singhbada acha kanoonlaae the, jisane 118 saal baad kisaan ko phir se jameendaar bana diya tha
 It is said that Narendra Modi is bringing a law that will bring farmers on the road
 bilkul vaise hi jaise aadhi shatabdi pehle ai film ‘do bigha jameen’ main garib kisaan kaa bane balraj saahani kaa parivaar sadq par aa gaya tha
 My own opinion is that Manmohan's law was more farmer friendly than Modi's law
 or sansad main bahumat kaa santulan kah rahaa he ki modi waalon ko manmohan waalon ke aage aaj nahin to kal jhukna padegaa
 But will this save the land? kya jameen bachaane vaale kanoon banane se jameen batch jaati he
 And can the farmer fill his stomach with the crop that grows after farming
 agar aisa he to kyon bharat ke girmitya shatabdiyon se desh hi kya dur desh main majuri karne ja rahe hai
 Why the villagers of Bihar, Purvanchal, Uttarakhand, Odisha and now Bundelkhand are turning to big cities for Majuri
 jab manmohan acha kanoon le aae the to yah palaayan band na sahi, kam to hona chahie tha
 i used to think so
 aisi hi kisi chunavi reporting ke silsile main jhaansi ke paas ek gaanv main gaya tha
 The village had the status of Ambedkar village
 vahaan tak pakki sadq jaati thi
 Indira dwellings of the village were also well maintained
 unamem shauchalay bhi the, jinke sarkari vigyapanon main kaha jaataa he-soch nahin shauchalay
 They get separate money
 lekin gaanv vaale inhen storeroom kii tarah istemaal kar rahe the or shankaa samaadhaan ke liye disha-maidan kii parampara nibhaae ja rahe the
 Well, the matter was about farming
 kheton main fasalein lahalha rahi thim
 The five-year drought was over by the end of the year
 7000 karod kaa bundelkhand package alag se khabaren bana rahaa tha
 In such a situation, i asked the old Dalit farmer - the crop is looking good
 usne haa main sir hilaayaa
 i added further - then it must have stopped going to Delhi
 usne bidi bujhaate hue meri baat se nittaphaki jataa di
 Then said - what will happen even if the crop will be good
 baap ke paas chaar bigha thi, ab itane bade parivaar ke liye itani si jameen main guzaara nahin hoga
 Work cannot go on without going to Delhi
 baaki kisaanon ne bhi us dopaher us buudhe kisaan kii haa main haa milaai thi
 i am not aware of farming, but if you have a thick intellect, then more than 50 percent of the farmers of the country are similarly small farmers
 or jo thodi badi jot ke hai, unka haal bhi bahut juda nahin he
 To this day, i do not forget the Kisan Sammelan in which many farmers of mid-sized holdings were uprooted because the MNREGA raised the wages of the chaiters
 ye kisaan kah rahe the ki itnaa paisa denge to kheti karne kaa matlab hi kya he
 i also know many people with government jobs who say that if it removes the salary then it is not possible to live in the village with respect to agriculture
 agar in sab virgon ko mila len to yah desh kaa 90 fisadi krishak samaaj ho jaataa he
 Farming is the tradition for this society, there is a way of living, a kind of habit but it is not guaranteed to live a happy life
 yah krishak samaaj sadiyon peeche khadaa he
 He gets the lowest price for his potato, onion, wheat and almost every produce
 uskaa aalu 2 ru kilo bik jaae to uske naseeb jaag jate hai, bhale hi bazaar main aalu tikki 25 ru kii or ek aalu ke vajan kaa ankal chips 100 ru kaa miltaa ho
 Even if we remove the price of his land, he is able to get barely 5 per cent of his annual wages as the price of the produce
 kisaan itane ghate ke dhandhe main he ki agar asli hisaab par use puraa bharosa ho jaae to desh kii badi aabaadi sidhe-sidhe depressant main chali jaaegi
 And if he somehow asks for the right price for his produce, then inflation will reach the seventh sky
 isiilie vyavastha ek dhundhalaka tari kiye rahati he jisamen kisaan hit kii baaten hoti rahati hai or kisaan vyavastha ko koste hue bhi use jeeta jaataa he
 Munshi Premchand had seen in his 30s that small farmers would not be able to do farming
 unki mashhoor kahani ‘pus kii raat’ main halku kheti chhod hi detaa he
 Since independence, governments have been doing something every time that Hulku kept giving up farming, but his woes of farming have not diminished even before
 aise main til-til kar marate kisaan ko ek dhakka dekar modi sarkaar is ajaab se mukt karnaa chaahati he
 Profit in farming can only come from modern farming, large holdings, capacity of hoarding with the farmer, insurance cover and access to desired market
 or itani sari khubiyaan kisaan main nahin sethji main hi ho sakati hai
 Large companies can grow a crop in large fields and charge it a hefty price, they can process it
 unki mahangi upaj damdaar marketing ke sahare bazaar main tik sakati he
 This is the model towards which both Manmohan and Jaitley's economy wants to take us
 jameen ke kanoon to jhunjhuna hai, asal takat to isi arthniti main chuphi he
 In such a situation, no matter the law, it is difficult to save the land
 vitt rajyamantri santosh kumaar gangavar ne loksabhaa main ek likhit jawaab main jaankaree dete hue bataaya ki piemjikevai ke tahat bainkon main behisabi jamaa par 50 pratishat kar or adhibhaar, donon, kaa praavdhaan he
 Apart from this, the declarer will have to keep a quarter of the total amount in an account without interest for four years

 Bhuiyan Mehboob Hasan, the local police chief, said the umpire gave the decision in favor of the batsman by giving a no ball

 They asked for water from a distance
 
 
 jahaaj ke captain ne pani diya
 
 
 And the boat went back with water
 phir dur sagar main ek chakkar lagaakar lagbhag paanch-saat minute main phir se vahi speed boat waapas lauti
 
 
 Out of the votes, 4-5 people climbed on the platform with the help of tires hanging from the moving ship
 
 
 or chadhate hi firing shuru ho gai
 
 
 
 ' Cadet Bhupendra Singh, narrating the incident with him, says, "when Captain Vikram Singh came out of the ship, he was attacked first
 unhen kaabo main kar jahaaj par maujuud sabhi logon ko ek jagah ikattha hone ke liye kaha gaya
 During this, Chief Engineer Narendra Kumar did some action and injured him with a knife

 While leaving, the door of the room was also closed

 abhi sabhi log raahat kii saans lene kii koshish kar hi rahe the ki ordinary siman bhupendra singh ko phir se ek or speed boat jahaaj ke nikat aati dikhaai di
 The boat was from the Iranian Coast Guard
 unhone turant lungar uthaane kaa aadesh dete hue kaha ki aap log bina anumati ke irani samudri seemaa main aa gaye ho or castady main ho
 Bhupendra Singh of Valsad, Vikas Chaudhary of Jaipur, Bhoomram Rundla and Ratiram Jat (both brothers), Amit Kumar of Ranchi, Jitendra Singh of Ludhiana, Vikram Singh of Bhiwani, Narendra Kumar of Rewari, Prakash Jadhav of Maharashtra and Sarwan Singh of Aligarh Admitted to c-horse Academy of Merchant Navy, a merchant navy training institute in Hyderabad
 course ke dauraan hi on board training or naukari kaa vaada kiye jane ke chalate in chaatro ko agenton ke jariye dubai kii bin khaadim company ke tel vaahak jahaaj 'al vatool' par tainaati kara di gai thi
 The youth had told their family members that they were stationed on an Iranian oil-importing ship from Sharjah
 castady main liye gaye in sabhi logon ko iran ke tapu khishm laayaa gaya or vahaan unhen kareeb dhai maheene rakhaa gaya
 After this he was shifted to Bandar Abbas
 yahaan unhen 18 maheene rakhaa gaya
 All the cadets were trying to contact the Indian consulate in some way
 antat: safalataa mili or takreeban saadhe 11 maheene baad ek farvari 2011 ko duutavas ke adhikari milane ke liye pahunche
 But instead of speaking two words of consolation, he cried out his problems and cries of not being able to do anything
 idhar, bharat main media ke halkon main yah khabar failane lagi
 On receiving the news of the cadets on the ship, their anxious family members were constantly trying to somehow find a news report
 parivarijanon ne jantar-mantar par anshan bhi kiya
 When the officials of the Indian Consulate arrived to meet these cadets trapped in Bandar Abbas, they told these cadets that they had to come here under the pressure of the media but they were not in a position to do much
 yahaan bharat main bhi in cadeton ke parijanon ne bandar abbaas sthit bhartiya vaanijya duutavas se sampark kiya
 Repeated call received 'assurance' of action
 lekin isse zyada kuch nahin hua
 Rajendra Singh Chaudhary, father of Bhupendra Singh, one of the young men and relatives of the Rundla brothers, tried to know from the Iranian embassy in India and the Ministry of External Affairs but the result
 
 
 vahi dhak ke teen paat
 'official' answers were received from the embassies for early action

 The order of putting caps on each other continued uninterrupted
 is sambandh main sabhi laapata cadeton ke parijanon ne raashtrapati pratibhadevi singh patil or gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi se bhi madad kii guhaar lagaai
 On February 26, once again some officials of the Indian Consulate also came to meet these cadets
 is baar bhi unke paas zyada kuch kehane or karne ke liye nahin tha
 The Indian Consulate was paralyzed in the legal proceedings that continued for 18 months
 tippaniyan However, due to the case of illegal entry and not being involved in any kind of smuggling, she finally brought a new dawn to the lives of these people on the morning of 29 February when they were told that they were now going to leave
 ye sabhi cadet ghar laut to aae hai lekin abhi tak lagbhag 22 maheene kii us traasadee ko bhula nahin paa rahe hai
 Since returning home, so far no contact has been made with the agents and shipowners appointing these people
 apane saath ghati anhoni kaa vrutant sunaate cadet bhupendra singh bataate hai, 'jahaaj ke captain vikram singh baahar nikle to sabase pehle unheen par hamalaa kar diya gaya
 They were controlled and all the people on the ship were asked to gather at one place
 is dauraan chif ejeeniyar narendra kumaar ne kuch harakat kii to unhen chaaku se ghayal kar diya
 Two cadets Sarwan Singh and Jitendra Singh hid in two different places in this chaos
 baaki ke logon ko gherkar ek kamare main thel diya gaya
 Some people were ordered to keep all the luggage aside
 sara saamaan tathaa haathon main or jebon main jo kuch tha wo sab chin liya gaya
 ' 'iske baad, brij main jaakar radar, jeepies or viechaef system ko tod daalaa
 Handling satellite phones, mobile phones, walkie talkie, went back on speed boat
 jate-jate kamare kaa darwaja bhi band kar gaye
 If there was complete peace on the ship for a while, the courage of the eight people broke out the door and came out
 vahiin kahin chipa hue jitendra singh bhi baahar nikal aayaa
 Saravan's body was lying near a cupboard in his room

 aakaa-kaari sahab thik hanatanki-kaari sahab ko fire lag gayaaka-usko pattee kerani thi taaki khun naa nikal jaeatanki-usko to dimag par lagi he phireaka-kispeatanki-dimag nahin hota he

 This blood will not be lost
 inspiration-insha allahuka-ya fight Now these conversations are very much similar to the conversations of mentors and terrorists during the Mumbai attack

 yah nai baat nahin he ki imran khan or china ke bich aapasi gathjod ke aarope lag rahe ho
 The situation was more or less the same in 2013, but then Imran could not reach power and now when he is reaching, the challenge for India is big
 pakistan main videsh niti par hameshaa se sena kaa dakhal rahaa he
 After Imran Khan assumed power, he would be completely in the hands of the army
 navaj sarkaar ke saath yaa uske peeche chuni hui kisi sarkaar ke saath jab-jab bharat ke rishte behatar hone kii disha main bade hai yaa to koi bada aatanki hamalaa hua he yaa phir pakistan kii taraf se sijafire ulanghan kiya gaya he
 Any other incident from across the border will break the peace process
 mumbai atake se lekar pathankot hamale tak iskaa udhaaharan he
 India has always been saying that terrorism and negotiations cannot go hand in hand, so the question is whether the power of Pakistan will answer terrorism by ending terrorism against India
 vaise kootneeti ke raste bharat ke liye hameshaa se khule rahe hai or aage bhi khule rahenge, lekin pakistan kii nai satta or vah bhi imran khan jiske peeche sena khadi he uske saath baatcheet karnaa apane aap main ek chunauti he

 In this way, Salman Khan's 'bajrangi Bhaijaan' on the occasion of Eid in Pakistan is going to be hit by two big films 'wrong No' and 'bin Roe', which are going to be released in Pakistan

 kolkata nite rides ke siio venki mysore ne kaha ki kris lin or andre rasel aath april ko royal chalangers bengalooru ke khilaaf pehle match tak feet ho jaaenge
 Mysore said at the Kolkata release of Sourav Ganguly's book 'A Century is Not Enough', 'we hope Lynn and Russell will play on April 8
 ve camp main aaenge
 Lynn of Australia has a shoulder injury, due to which he could not play Pakistan Super League
 jabaki westeindies ke olerounder rasel ko piesel ke dauraan mansapeshi main khinchaav aa gaya tha
 England's team all out for 58, made 130 years after the embarrassing record that Kolkata Knight Riders 9 this time Chris Lynn in the players' auction
 6 karod rupaye main kharida tha
 While Andre Russell was retained for Rs 7 crores
 darasal, australia or newjiland ke bich khele gaye tri siries final ke dauraan lin kaa kandhaa khisak gaya
 While fielding in this match, Chris Lynn got his shoulder hurt while diving

 dilli emsidi chunaav main 270 siton par rujhaan saamne hai
 If these trends turn into results, then it is clear that the BJP is going to put a hat-trick of geeks in the MCD
 aaiye jaanate hai in rujhaanon ke liye dilli or desh ke siyaasi khilaadiyon ke kya myne ho sakate hai?kejariwal kaa karishma khatm?saal 2015 ke vidhansabha chunaav main aam aadmi party ne bijepi ko karaari maat di thi
 This was the time when Prime Minister Modi's popularity was at the peak after the Lok Sabha elections
 isi jeet ke dam par kai vishleshkon ne aam aadmi party ko vipakshi party ke taur par congress kaa ubharta vikalp tak bataa diya tha
 But the defeat in the MCD election will prove that Kejriwal's credibility among the people of Delhi has decreased
 ye tab he jab party ne garib tabakon ko bijli, pani, shiksha jaisi suvidhaayen muhaiyaa karwaane ke bade-bade daawey kiye the
 Therefore, the result of the MCD election will force Kejriwal & Co
 to focus on strengthening their stronghold of Delhi, instead of going to the polls for states like Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh
 jaahir he ki haar kaa thikra mahaj iviem main gadabadi par phodna party ke kaam nahin aayega
 It is no secret that the people of Delhi were plagued by MCD corruption
 bijepi lagaataar do baar ke kaarykaal ke baad satta-virdohi lahar kii ashanka se jujh rahi thi
 This is the reason why the party did not give tickets to any sitting councilor
 lekin teenon nagar nigamon main bahumat ye sabit karegaa ki modi kii lahar ab upi ke raste dilli bhi pahunchi he
 After this victory, it will once again be confirmed that Modi is the highest leader in the current state of politics
 ye jeet dilli bijepi adhyaksh manoj tiwari ke liye bhi kisi tamge se kam nahin he
 It can be expected that after this their political weight will also increase and they can expect some big responsibility in the party
 congress kaa kambaikais chunaav main agar kisi party ke paas khone ke liye kuch nahin tha to wo congress hi thi
 The party could not even open an account in the 2015 assembly elections
 haalanki emsidi main use jeet to hasil nahin ho saki
 Before the election, well-known Congress leaders like Arvinder Singh Lovely and Barkha Singh also joined the BJP
 lekin chunaav main aam aadmi party ko kadi takkar dena bhi party ke liye uplabdhi se kam nahin he
 After this result, the party can be satisfied that its political roots are still not dry in the capital and it has at least managed to beat the Aam Aadmi Party
 anya partiyon ke liye kya sandesh?emsidi chunaav yogendra yadav or prashanth bhushan kii party swaraj india ke liye bhi kaaphi ahm tha
 This was the first time Swaraj India entered the electoral fray after being expelled from the Aam Aadmi Party
 haalanki rujhaan bataa rahe hai ki yadav or bhushan kii saaf chhavi ke baavjood dilliwaalon ne unpar koi khaas yakeen nahin kiya he
 Even more bad news in the trends is hidden for the Bahujan Samaj Party
 aam aadmi party ke tasviir main aane se pehle bispi dilli main tisare number kii party thi
 In the 2012 MCD election, it won 12 seats with around 10 per cent of the votes
 lekin is baar naa sirf bispi kii siten balki janaadhar bhi sikuda he
 Many times we take help of home remedies for small health related problems and they also give us relief from these problems
 lekin kya har baar aisa karnaa sahi hota he
 Probably not, because if a little carelessness is used in their use, it can prove harmful to us
 aaie jaanate hai aise hi kuch gharelu nuskhon ke bare main jinka istemaal hamaare liye ghaatak bhi ho saktaa he
 
 
 1
 munhaason par toothpaste kaa istemaltoothpaste main kai tarah ke chemical hote hai or agar munhaason par ise lagaaya jaae to yebacteria ko badhaaskate hai
 So avoid doing this
 2
 Lime water in jaundice disease Many people resort to home remedies to cure jaundice disease and for this, the patient is fed lime water
 aisa karne se bachein kyonki isamen maujuud chemicals pilia thik nahin karte balki swasthya sambandhi samasyaon ko or badha dete hai
 3
 massa hataane ke nuskhechehare or sharir ke anya hisson main agar massa ho jaae to use dhaage, patale taar yaa blade se katkar hataane se bachein
 By doing this, the bacteria present in the thread and wire reach inside the skin and cause infection
 4
 Many people apply butter on burns
 agar aap bhi aisa hi kuch upaay karte hai to jaan len ki skin bahut sensitive hoti he or makkhan lagane se ghaav main maujuud bacteria aasapaas bhi fail sakate hai
 5
 ghaav par kapadaa baandhnakai baar chot lagane par log use kapade se baandh dete hai jabaki aisa bilkul nahin karnaa chahie
 By doing this, the injury does not evaporate and bacteria grow
 isse ghaav thik hone main zyada samay lagata he

 Union Minister and LJP chief Ram Vilas Paswan said on Sunday that everything is fine in the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in Bihar and Nitish Kumar is our leader in the state
 unhone jediu netaa ke centre kii narendra modi sarkaar main shaamil nahin hone ke faisle ko bhi zyada tavajjo nahin dene kii baat kahi
 Answering questions from journalists, Ram Vilas Paswan said, 'everything is fine in NDA
 nitish kumaar hamaare netaa hai
 Too many implications should not be removed
 unhone (nitish) bhi kaha he ki vah endie main the, hai or rahenge or, main vahaan majbootee dene vaali shakti ke rup main hum hi
 Asked if he would convince Kumar to change his stand and join the Modi government, Paswan said, "he (kumar) is capable of making his decisions
" isse bhi zyada, samasya kahaan he jab unhone yah spasht kar diya ki vah puri tarah endie ke saath hai
 When Paswan was asked about the leaders of the Lok Janshakti Party in the state cabinet, he deferred this question
 algepi ke kisi netaa ko aaj hue vistaar main shaamil nahin kiya gaya he jabaki uske ek maatr mantri pashupati kumaar paras loksabhaa ke liye nirvaachit ho chuke hai
 Paswan claimed, 'let me tell you, when (nitish) Kumar formed the NDA government, i did not request him to make Paras a minister because he is my younger brother
 unhone (kumaar ne) hi jor diya tha ki kumaar ke anubhav or varishthata ke maddenjar unhen rajya mantrimandal main nishchit hi lojpa kaa pratinidhitiv karnaa chahie

 iske baad janata dal united (JDU) ke adhyaksh or bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne ishaaron-ishaaron main jataate hue kaha tha ki party bijepi se naaraaz he
 He had said, such a report is coming in the media that we are demanding 3 seats which is completely wrong
 patna airport par utarane ke baad patrakaron se baatcheet karte hue nitish kumaar ne kaha tha ki unki ummid thi ki sankhya bal ke aadhaar par bijepi sahyogi dalon ko mantriparishad main jagah degi magar aisa nahin hua

 to unki criation par mujhe shat pratishat yakeen he
 You started with b and c grade films and now you are called a commercial actor, how do you take this change? When doing films, the ability within oneself is estimated
 mujhe commercial kaa to nahin pataa lekin actor banane kaa jo sapana tha usko puraa karne ke liye jo bhi ho paayegaa wo jarur karata rahoonga
 Do you want to do small films even today? i have done many short films, but due to the lack of promotion, she could not reach everyone and due to which, due to disappointment, i will definitely do short films too, provided her promotions are good Be done in a manner log kehete hai kii aap 'grey shed' ke role zyaadaatar karte hai?dekhiye 'grey shed' or 'negative role' donon alag tarah ke kirdaar hote hai
 Negative means completely negative, but gray shades mean a different character
 filmon main hero or villen hi aise kirdaar hote hai jinamein shed nahin hota, to ek actor ke taur par main hameshaa se vahi kirdaar nibhaana chahta hum jisamen koi shed ho
 In which there are many layers, i enjoy doing the same character

 What is the mantra of success for you? If i come to play even 10% of the scene given by the director, then the success is completed there
 kya ab aap sirf lead role hi karenge?dekhiye mere liye lead role bhi ek kirdaar kii hi tarah hota he
 'hero' is also a character for me
 kabhi diarection ke bare main sochaa he aapane?mujhe diarection kaa 'di' bhi nahin aata he
 i can only do acting
 aapane apane bete kaa naam 'yani' rakhaa he, kya yah pehle se hi tay tha?ji meri shaadi hui thi tabhi maine plan kar liya tha ki agar ladkaa hua to 'yani' or ladki hui to 'shohara' naam rakhuunga
 So now that i am a boy, i have named 'yani'
 iskaa matlab king of kool' he
 That is, 'peaceful'
 kashmir main aapane shooting kii he?kashmir ke log kaaphi sidhe saadhe hai

 rampal ke bare main har roj nae khulaase ho rahe hai
 According to the information received till date, Rampal used to make claims of sending his devotees to heaven and to see the glimpse of God and in return he used to make money
 rampal ke ashram main 5 lakh kaa masageraapako yaad he naa ki rampal kii khatir unke samarthak police ke khilaaf dat gaye the
 Actually, Baba had shown dreams of heaven to these supporters
 ye wo samarthak the jinhen baba ne bhagwaan se milaane kaa vaada kiya tha
 That too not for free but with money
 deraa par kanoonee gheraa! band hogi babagiri?rampal ne paap kaa jo samrajya khadaa kiya tha usamen swarg or bhagwaan kii badi bhoomika thi
 Rampal, like the Ponzi scheme, had laid a web of agents who worked to find paid devotees for Baba
 ponji skim or rampal ke paap skim main fark sirf itnaa tha ki baba kisi bhi agent ko paise nahin detaa tha
 Playing the role of an agent was a special supporter of Baba, whom Baba trusted more than himself
 wo agent doordaraj ke gaanvon main ghoomte or bhole bhaale logon ko baba ke chamatkaar kii kahaniyaan sunaate
 Those agents of Rampal used to show dreams to the poor that Baba Rampal can take away all their grief and sorrow
 unki sari samasyaon kaa samaadhaan kar saktaa he
 Baba's agent naive spears trick people that Rampal has the power to send heaven
 wo agent logon ko bataate ki baba rampal bhagwaan se milaane kii takat rakhata he
 As soon as a person could trust Baba's miraculous forces, Rampal's agents would take him to the Satlok Ashram and then a game of faith and superstition began
 pehali baar satalok ashram main pahunche samarthakon ko rampal kai tarah ke sapane dikhaata or unase paise vasuulata
 At the same time, the supporters are sworn that each supporter will bring three new devotees for Baba
 phir wo teen nae bhakton par hoti duusare nae bhakton ko laane kii jimmedaari
 It is not that Rampal once spared his devotees with money
 dilachasp he ki baba ne vakt ke hisaab se paise tay kar rakhe the
 This means that as devotion increases, the charge to see God and feel heaven increases

 or yaheen aakar kisi diarector ke liye kuch nayaa karne kaa sankat paidaa ho jaataa he
 Talking about Singham Returns, this is also a similar film
 kaaphi kuch singhm jaisi hi he
 The film is entirely for the message
 shaayad rohit apane formule ko hi aajmaana chaahate hai auki kuch nayaa karne ke iraade nahin rakhte hai
 This is the perfect dose for fans of masala films, apart from the fans of Rohit Shetty and Ajay Devgan
 hero jeetta he or janata main josh bharta he
 Do not ask about how powerful the story is bollywood ke diarectors ne jaise jimmaa hi uthaa liya he ki puri film ko sirf superstar power par hi kheenchna he
 Therefore, the story does not matter much to him and it is clear that there is a bigger artist than art and story
 kahani ke liye zyada dimag lagane kii jarurat nahin
 Baji Rao Singham comes to Mumbai
 vah pehle jaisaa hi dabang or sakht mizaaj he
 Nothing has changed
 yahaan bhi uski bhidant bhrasht netaa or samaaj ke thekedaaron se hoti he
 He has a girlfriend
 karina kapur jo film main bich-bich main aati rahati he
 There is dialogue, fighting and songs keep on coming
 matlab masala film
 Do not think too much
 film main sab kuch aajamaaya hua hi he
 Now spice movies are like this
 star apilafilm puri tarah se ajay devgan ke upar hi he
 Ajay's style, action and dialogue make the film special
 ve achche lagate hai
 Anyway, his previous films Himmatwala and Satyagraha could not do a big miracle at the box office, and now the Superstar Club is 200 crore anyway
 kaa ho gaya he
 In this way he has a lot at stake
 karina kapur oke hai
 Amol Gupte is also right
 kamai kii batfilm puri tarah se janata ke liye banaai gai he yani masej ke liye
 It's a good thing
 single screen par dekhne ke baad film pataa chal jaataa he ki phultu sitimar he
 Anyway, there is no dearth of fans of masala films
