 In this episode, read today, Bhagat Singh's letter to the jailer in which he had informed about the hunger strike
 8 april, 1929 ko bhagat singh or batukeshwar dutt ne dilli assembly main bam phenke
 The two shouted slogans after throwing bombs, threw leaflets but did not run away but stayed there so that the police could arrest them
 or aisa hi hua, donon ko giraftaar kar liya gaya, court main peshi hui
 Both gave strong arguments in the court, which was also praised by the judge
 lekin sazaa donon ko phir bhi mili or umrakaid kaa elaan hua
 After the punishment was announced, Bhagat Singh was taken from Delhi to Mianwali Jail of Punjab, Batukeshwar Dutt to Lahore Jail
 lekin donon ne dekha ki raajnneetik kaidiyon ke saath acha vyavhaar nahin kiya ja rahaa he, iske virodh main bhagat singh ne awaz uthaai
 On this issue, Bhagat Singh wrote a letter to the jailer of Mianwali jail on 17 June 1929, in which he made his demands
 bhagat singh kii chitthee is prakaar he:inspector general, jells, punjab, lahore!assembly bamkand dilli ke maamle main mujhe umrakaid kii sazaa mili he, yani main raajnneetik bandi hum

 In the last few days, the weight has decreased by 6 pounds compared to Delhi jail, so i should get special food as a political prisoner

 After returning from the national capital, Rajkhowa told reporters, "we met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh at his residence and we are happy with his attitude towards solving the Assam problem
" ’unhone kaha, ‘pradhanmantri ne hamen assam kii samasyaon ke sammanjanak or sweekaarya samaadhaan ke bare main aashwast kiya he or unke saath hamaari baatcheet behad sauhardpurn rahi
 'he said,' The Prime Minister also appreciated our initiative to come forward for peace talks and our resolve to solve the problem through dialogue
 ’rajkhova ne kaha ki 25 may 2005 ko pradhanmantri kaa patr paane ke baad se hi ulpha baatcheet ke liye aage aane par vichaar kar rahi thi
 In the letter, he wrote about negotiating all the issues

 In the dark night on the open border of Bhitta mor-janakpur between India and Nepal, this slogan is greeted on mobile

 The slogan of "jai Madhesh" echoed in the 1,800 km long Terai region of Nepal

 a warning to Sharma Oli is that this situation, which arises out of a poisonous mixture of incomplete demands and caste discrimination, may pose a threat to him
 pichley 2 november ko tadake aakrosh or asantosh ke is ubhaar ne nayaa rup le liya jab kuch pulisavaale maitri sethu par so rahe madheshiyon par tut pade
 Madheshi means people of Indian origin who settled on the land between India and Nepal a few hundred years ago
 in pulisavaalon ne madheshiyon ko dandon se peeta or unke tambu jala die
 When they left their mobiles and goods and started running here and there to save their lives, it was revealed to the people of the Terai that the government of Nepal would be crushed by their performance going on for 80 days
 yah to mahaj shuruyaat thi
 The same afternoon, angry Nepali policemen caught a young man passing through the grand Shankaracharya gate located before Maitri Setu
 darbhanga kaa ashish ram birganj main apni maa ke parivaar se milane aayaa tha
 Here the practice of weddings is common among the people of Mithilanchal and Madhesh
 us dopaher 19 saal kaa yah ladkaa raksol main apane ghar laut rahaa tha
 a few feet away from the scene, Sanjay Yadav was waiting for his India truck to cross
 yadav kehete hai, “yah ladkaa pradarshnkaree nahin tha
 He was walking towards the bridge when Nepali policemen grabbed him and pulled him to death
 ”golibari kii ghatana ke baad birganj main tanaav badha to kuch yuva apane gharon se nikal aae or tair jalaakar shahar ke mukchay raste band karne lage
 Stoning continued till late in the afternoon

 By evening, Prime Minister Narendra Modi called Oli and demanded an inquiry into Ram's death
 choubees ghante ke bheetar oli ne bharat ko chetavanee jari kar di ki vah apane kaam se kaam rakhe
 He said in a meeting, India is interfering in Nepal's "internal affairs" and "provoking the Madheshi parties"
 ”birganj main bharat kii vaanijya mahadoot anju ranjan ne india today ko bataaya, “bharat, nepal kii sabhi aantarik samasyaon kaa hal samvaad or paraspar paraamarsh ke jariye chahta he
 Nepal itself is responsible for its crisis, so it should stop blaming India
 ”vidambnaa yah he ki bharat ne nepal ke aantarik maamalon main aakhri baar 2006 main dakhal diya tha jab bharat samarthit nepal kii loktantric partiyon ne, jisamen oli kii nekapa-emale bhi thi, rajshahi ko ukhaad phenkaa tha
 Oli had praised India at the time
 ek dashak bhi nahin beetaa he ki bharat or nepal phir ulajh gaye hai
 Kathmandu's elite within and outside Nepal's government is supporting a recently passed constitution that discriminates against Madheshis
 nepali samvidhan ke anusaar chunaav kshetron kaa jaisaa parisemen kiya gaya he, vah tarai ke saath gambhir bhedbhaav karata he, kyonki yah parisemen aabaadi ke aadhaar par nahin, balki bhugolinta ke aadhaar par kiya gaya he
 Understand it in such a way that if a population of 5,000 makes a constituency in a mountainous region, then in the Terai the same limit has been made for a population of one lakh
 duusare, madheshi yah bhi kah rahe hai ki naukarshahi or police main “pahaad kii oonchi jatiyon” yani brahmanon or chhetriyon kaa pratinidhitiv zyada he jabaki in kshetron main madheshiyon ko 1
 Only 2 percent are employed

 Upendra Yadav, president of Madheshi Janadhikar Forum, says, “the mountain has made the Terai its colony
 raajaaon ne jo kiya tha yaa usase bhi pehle east india company ke daur main jo haal tha, aaj halaat usase behatar nahin hai
 Yadav cites the Sugauli Treaty of 1816, according to which the East India Company divided Nepal and separated some of the fertile lands of the Terai from it
 baad main 1857 kii pehali aazaadee kii ladaai ko dabaane main gorkhaon ke yogadan swaroop 1860 main nepal ko kuch hisse waapas kar die gaye
 Later the rulers kept changing and the ownership of land with them also changed, but the bread-daughter relationship between the people of Mithilanchal and Madhesh continued
 nepal ke nae samvidhan ne is yugon puraani parampara main amulchul badlaav kar diya he
 It states that Indian women married at Madhesh will be considered foreigners
 pehle yah vyavastha thi ki madhesh main byaahi jane vaali auraten bhartiya naagarikta ko chhodkar apane pati kii naagarikta le sakati thim or nepal main rojgaar paa sakati thim
 The support of the people of Madheshi movement is based on the fear that this old tradition will be destroyed

 At least so far, Kathmando is determined not to bow down
 gusse main oli ne nepal ko petrol kii aapurti ke liye global tender nikaalane kaa hukum de diya
 They consider the blockade of Birganj as "india sponsored" and want to break it by purchasing oil from other countries
 kai chini companiyon ne aavedan kiya, magar pataa yah chalaa ki unhone jo keemten bataayin, ve bhartiya companiyon kii keemton se doguni se bhi zyada thim
 China has provided assistance of 1,000 metric tons of petrol, but it is not expected to last more than a few days
 bhartiya rajanyikon ne “china card” khilne kii kathmando kii girti-padati koshishon par kuch bhi kehane se inkaar kar diya, lekin madheshi andolankaaree itani ehtiyaat baratane ko taiyaar nahin hai
 There is no doubt that Kathmandu is playing the same old game
 vah madhesh ke saath bharat ke puraane rishte ke mukaable paaramparik pratidwandvi china ko khadaa kar rahaa he
 But Beijing also knows very well that it cannot spread much hands and feet in Nepal and cannot undoubtedly take the place of India in the Terai
 nepal ke saath bharat ke bhugolic, bhaavnaatmak, rajnatik or paariwarik rishton ko lekar dilli or beijing ke bich ek aghoshit sahmati he
 That is, Beijing is unlikely to do anything that will bring a fundamental relationship between India and Nepal
 madheshi forum ke yadav ne tarai main andolankariyon ko china ke jhandon kii holi jalaane se rokane kii koshish kii
 He explained to them that it was a very slippery slope
 yadav ne kaha, “bharat kii taraf bhakthi dikhaane kaa yah tarika nahin he
 China has neither interest nor interest in the Terai
 vah madhesh ko takreeban bharat kaa hissaa hi maanata he
 We have to be pro-madhesh, that is, we have to be pro-nepal
 ”nepal sadbhaavna party ke adhyaksh rajendra mahato kehete hai, “jai madhesh andolan bilkul vaisaa hi he, jaisaa 1971 main bangladeshiyon ne jai bangla andolan khadaa kiya tha or jiske natijatan vah pakistan se alag ho gaya tha
 If Kathmandu is not ready to handle Madhesh can also go the same way
 ”bharat kii niti duuri banaae rakhkar najadik se nigaah rakhane kii he
 But three months ago when the protests suddenly became fierce and widespread, India too was not prepared to take such a turn of circumstances
 tabhi rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar ajit dobhaal or videsh sachiv es
 Jaishankar started competing with each other in search of the right solution to the issue, which PM Narendra Modi should adopt against Nepal
 alabatta in shuruaati dagamagaahaton ke baad bharat kii niti main tehraav aayaa lagata he
 Recently, when Nepal's pro-shah Deputy Prime Minister Kamal Thapa visited India, he exhorted New Delhi to persuade the Madheshi agitators to withdraw the movement
 lekin videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj ne unhen yaad dilaayaa ki “madheshiyon se thos baatcheet hi ekmaatr jawaab he
 Both Thapa and Oli did not budge
 madheshi netaaon ke saath baatcheet kaa koi nateeja nahin niklaa
 So far 44 Madheshi and eight Nepalese policemen have been killed in the protests and the situation is expected to worsen
 aasaan tarika yahi hoga ki kathmando maane ki madheshiyon ke saath gaiyr-barabari kaa bartaav ho rahaa he or ab unki shikaayatein dur karne kaa vakt aa gaya he
 It is a scary thought to leave the Terai burning for a long time, which should immediately remove all the leaders of Kathmandu and Madhesh

 Of course, his primary job is to bowl wickets for the team, but the runs scored by him in the lower order prove to be very useful for Team India at times
 kam se kam test cricket main 'aish' ne khud ko olerounder ke rup main sthapit kar liya he
 As Ashwin plays for Team India, almost the same role for New Zealand in the Kanpur Test was played by spin bowler Mitchell Santner (32 runs)

 Santner has just played seven Tests, but looking at the way he batted against the Indian spinners on the spin track at Green Park on Saturday, it is to be expected that he will also be in the future with the ball for New Zealand

 RSS pracharak and Rashtriya Muslim Manch convenor Indresh Kumar took a dig at Mulayam Singh after the statement related to the kar sevaks of the Ayodhya movement
 indresh kumaar ne mulaayam ko khoonkhaar apradhi or hatyara tak kah daalaa
 In Lucknow, Indresh Kumar crossed the language limit and said that if he stays alive then he can commit more murders
 indresh kumaarane kaha ki raajnneeti or kursi ke liye mulaayam singh musalamaanon kii bhi hatya kara saktaa he
 The union leader has appealed to the court and the Human Rights Commission to register a case against Mulayam Singh
 mulaayam bole- 16 kii jagah 30 karsevakon kii bhi jaan le saktaa thasmajawaadee party ke supremeo mulaayam singh yadav ne lakhanu ke indira gandhi pratishthan main apane jivan sangharsh par aadhaarit kitaab ke vimochan samaaroh main sambodhan ke dauraan vivaadit bayaan diya tha
 He had said on the incident of firing on karsevaks in 1990 that a total of 16 people had died in it
 ekta ko bachaane ke liye 16 kii jagah 30 jaane leni padati to bhi koi gam na hota
 Constitutional institutions taking cognizance of Mulayam's statement, Indresh Kumar said, "mulayam Singh has accepted that he is a very big killer
 usne pradesh ke sarvocch pad par baith kar nirih rambhakton kii hatya karne kaa kaam kiya he
 Also, he is saying that if needed, he could have killed more people by firing more bullets
 usne apana jurm kabul kar liya he
 For that i will appeal to the state government, the state human rights commission, the state high court
 saath hi bharat sarkaar se, bharat ke maanavadhikaar ayog se aurasarvocch nyaayalayase bhi ye apil karuunga ki aise khoonkhaar apradhi ke khilaaf notice de or mukadmaa darj kare, kyonki hatyara agar jinda rahegaa or wo kahata rahegaa ki wo or bhi hatya kara saktaa he, to desh ke andar sushasan or vikaas ke bajaay araajaktaa, hinsa or gundgardee penpegi
 How will the people of the country teach such killers a lesson in democracy, it will decide the people of the country
 ye syrius baat he ki ek hatyara khuleam ghumta rahe or uske khilaaf maanavadhikaar ayog, supreme court, hai court sangyaan na le
 My prayer to all of these is to take serious note of this statement
 desh or pradesh kii sarkaar in aparaadhiyo se logon kii suraksha kii guarantee le
 'mulayam can get Muslims killed if needed,' he said, 'it is such a crime statement
 aparaadh kaa arth ye he ki agar wo ye sochate hai ki wo muslim tushtikaran kar rahe hai
 Muslims should also understand that those who are not of their caste or their favorite will be able to become theirs
 iskaa matlabamulaayam sinhan desh kaa he, na dharm kaa he or na jati kaa he
 He is not someone, he is only of his petty politics and chair
 kal use lagegaa to wo shaayad musalamaanon kii hatya karne kii sajeesh kar saktaa he
 Therefore, i will tell the people of the country that they should be careful with the conspiracy of such killers
 jaagruk rahen, agar usne galat nirnay kar liya to parinaam uttar pradesh ke liye achche nahi honge
 Therefore, i caution the people of the state and the country about such petty politics
 wo netaa chahie, wo dal chahie jo sabko saath lekar sabakaa vikaas kare, jo sabaki hit kii baat kare, jo hatyaon kii, nafrat kii or barbaadi kii raajnneeti na kare
 Who should do development, education and politics of brotherhood
 tabhi wo netaa or dal chalenge
 Those leaders and parties should not run in India, which does politics of waste, violence and fighting

 Ramdas Athawale, the national president of the Republican Party of India and the Minister of State for Social Justice and Empowerment of the Government of India, said on Friday that his party would appeal against the decision of the Supreme Court by filing a petition in the court and become a party to the case

 kyonki isse giraftaar kaa dar khatm ho jayega or daliton par atyaachaar bad saktaa he
 He said that some false cases may have been filed under this act and in some cases misuse of this act, but in most cases it has been successful in protecting the interests of a Dalit
 unhone kahakis act ke tahatgaiyr jamaanti hona iske kargar hone kaa bada kaaran he
 He also claimed that 99% of the incidents recorded under CSC, ST Act are correct
 athavle ne kaha ki is maamle main koi duusare dalit netaaon ke saath bhi sampark main hai taaki supreme court main joardaar pairvi kii ja sake
 Athawale said that Congress should not do politics in the matter of protecting the interests of Dalits and should go step by step with the government

 The country's interim budget is going to be presented on 1 February before the Lok Sabha elections
 modi sarkaar ke is bajet se har varg ke logon ko ummid he
 At the same time, given the general budget of 2018, the interim budget is being considered very important for the women of the country
 darasal, beete saal ke aam bajet main kaamkaaji or gramin kshetra kii mahilaon ko kai khaas tohfe die gaye the
 In view of the Lok Sabha elections, there may be big announcements for women in the interim budget of Modi government
 mahila suraksha sabase ahmavaise to har saal ke aam bajet main modi sarkaar mahila suraksha ko lekar chintaa jaahir karti rahi he lekin is disha main ab bhi thos kadam nahin uthaae gaye hai
 The Nirbhaya Fund is expected to focus on the safety of women in public space in this interim budget
 mahilaon kii ucch shiksha sasti hone ke alaava nayaa kaarobaar shuru karne ke liye saste byaaj par rin ko lekar bhi ahm faisla ho saktaa he
 Special attention may be given by the government to the things used by women
 bataa den ki mahilaon ke istemaal kii chizon par jiesti council ne raahat de di thi
 Last year, sanitary pads were excluded from the purview of GST, while the GST slab of cosmetic products has also been cut
 agar kaamkaaji mahilaon ke liye baat karen to unki iskar kii seemaa badhaai ja sakati he
 The Budget Modi government had a special focus on women in the Budget 2018
 bajet main kaamkaaji mahilaon ko raahat dete hue unki pief madad ko pehle 3 saal 8 fisadi karne kaa elaan kiya
 Till earlier this assistance was 12 per cent for both men and women
 sarkaar ke is faisle ke baad kaamkaaji mahilaon kii in hand selary main ijapha hua
 The middle class women benefited the most from this decision
 vahiin pichley bajet main gramin ilaakon kii garib mahilaon ke liye bhi khaas elaan kiya gaya tha
 During the budget, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley announced to provide free gas connections to 8 crore women under the Ujjwala scheme
 pehle is yojana ke tahat kareeb 5 karod mahilaon ko hi yah suvidha die jane kaa lakshya tha
 At the same time, the government also announced to increase the target of loans for women self-help groups to Rs 75,000 crore and to increase the amount of National Rural Livelihoods Mission for Women to more than Rs 5 thousand crore
 2017 ke bajet main kya mila tha2017 ke bajet main mahilaon ke skill deveopment par focus tha

 At the same time, it was announced to transfer Rs 6,000 directly to the account of pregnant women

 Ranbir Kapoor and Katrina Kaif starrer Jagga Jasoos received mixed response
 box offis par iskaa kuch aisa asar padaa jisase jagga jasoos kii team bahut khush to nahin hogi
 However, there is still hope because Jagga's 3-day collection has been around 31 crores, which is not as bad as the film industry was feeling
 jagga jasoos ke pehle din kaa collection tha 8 karod, duusare din rahaa 10
 75 crores and 12 on the third day
 25 karod
 That means the total collection of Total Weekend was 31 crores
 nahin milegi barfi vaali saxelcchhi baat ye he ki har din collection kaa graph badha he
 According to trade magazine Super Cinema Editor Amul Mohan - The film's collection is not so bad which proves that Kiranbir Kapoor's star power
 anuraag basu or ranbir kapur kii pichhali film barfi kii raftaar bhi box offis par dhimi shuru hui thi lekin barfi ne 98 karod kaa bijness kiya tha
 However, despite the graph of Jagga Jasoos increasing, the future of the film will not be bright and Barfi will not be successful because the budget of the film is very high
 jagga kii mekking or publicity ke saath isaki laagat padi he 110 karod jisaki recovery naammumkin he
 Trade pundits also believe that lessons need to be taken once again from films like Jagga Jasoos
 flop nahin to munafa bhi nahibgar film kaa bajet 50-60 karod ke bich rahata to ye bhi hit ho sakati thi
 Despite this being a full week, the jagga detective will not make a profit
 haa, ye jarur he ki itani badi flop nahin hogi jitani ranbir kapur kii bonmbe velvet thi
 The 'monkeys' spoiled the game, with its shortcomings of Jugga Spy also being harmed by Hollywood's Spiderman and The Planet of the Apes
 darasal, donon filmon ke darshak bant gaye
 In such a situation, Bollywood is in dire need of lessons from Hollywood or else Hollywood will take advantage of the weak film
 zyada ho saktaa tha nuksaan,agar
 
 
 According to the news, the loss to Jagga Jasoos could have been worse because it is believed that Ranbir Kapoor and director Anurag Basu's fees are not included in the budget of 110 crores
 vahiin katrina ne bhi behad kam fees main ye film kii he
 If the fees of these three were also included, then the budget of Jagga Jasoos would have been at least 140 crores
 ranbir kapur or nirdeshak anuraag basu is film ke nirmaataa bhi hai isaliye baat 140 karod tak nahin pahunchi
 But it is definitely that Bollywood has to overcome both its stories and budget or else Hollywood will win

 hajaare ne likhaa, ‘‘team anna bahut majboot he or koi use nahin tod saktaa
 There was speculation to dissolve the core committee
 mujhe yah sahi nahin lagata
 If we leave the ground due to some allegations, then the credibility of the movement will be low and it is not right for the movement

 He said that the details of accounts of the movement will be put on the website on November 1
 kashmir sambandhi bayaan par vivaad main aaye prashanth bhushan ke sandarbh main hajaare ne kaha ki cameti main kai sadsy hai jo anek vichaardhaaraon main bharosa rakhte hai
 Hazare said, "members have their own social and political perspectives and many of them are working on many issues
" kuch muddon par unki raay alag ho sakati he lekin kisi sadsy vishesh ke vichaaron ko anna hajaare paksh ke vichaaron ke taur par nahin dekha ja saktaa
 On the question of the possibility of rejoining Swami Agnivesh who was dropped from the team in the event of restructuring, Kejriwal expressed his feelings for Hazare and said, "we will think about it later

 Kejriwal refused to comment on Congress General Secretary Digvijay Singh's allegations against Hazare and his team
 jab team anna se poocha gaya ki ve uttar pradesh main basapa ke khilaaf abhiyaan kyon nahin chalaa rahe to unhone kaha ki team anna ko congress se koi nafrat nahin he yaa basapa adhyaksh mayawati se koi vishesh sneh nahin he or unka mukhya mudda jan lokapal vidheyak ko paarit karana he

 As much as Salman Khan is infamous for his criminal exploits, so much so as to prolong the cases against him
 trial court ne unhen doshi qaraar diya or is faisle ko talwaane ke liye unhen ab oonchi adaalat kii sharan leni hogi
 In 1998, a lawsuit was filed against Salman for hunting two blackbuck
 5 april ko niyati ne phir se unka peechha kiya or jodhpur kii ek adaalat ne unke liye paanch saal kii kaid kii sajaa sajaa suna di
 While preparations were on to take Salman to Jodhpur Central, his lawyer was filing a bail application in the sessions court to get him out on bail as soon as possible
 yadi seshan court jamaanat nahin milti he to hycourt main apil kii jaaegi
 The Chief Judicial Magistrate (CJM) of Jodhpur sentenced Salman
 abhiyojan paksh kii daleel thi ki salmaan ko baar-baar aparaadh karne kii aadat he
 This thing went against him and it also got more punishment
 pehle bhi salmaan ko nichali adaalaton ne do maamalon main sajaa sunai he lekin baad main unhen bari kar diya gaya
 In one of these cases, the state has appealed against the acquittal and a decision on this is still pending
 unhen amrs act main bhi bari kar diya gaya tha
 Salman was shocked when the court sentenced him because the amount of punishment he has been awarded is more than his apprehension
 unhen thodi sajaa kii ummid thi or unka chartered aircraft dopaher baad tak unako lekar mumbai udaye ko taiyaar khadaa tha
 This conviction proves that if the investigation of the case is done properly, then it results, no matter how late the trial is
 lekin salmaan ke sah-abhiyukton ko bari kar diya janaa jaisaa ki pehle ke mukademon main bhi hua he, unke liye ek badi raahat kii baat he or apil ke stage yah baat unke paksh main jaaegi
 His co-accused Saif Ali Khan, Neelam, Tabu and Sonali Bendre, who were with Salman at the time, have been acquitted
 ek sthaneey travel oparator jis par un sabhi ko shikaar par le jane kaa aarope tha, use bhi bari kar diya gaya
 These film stars came to shoot for the film Hum Saath Saath Hain and stayed at Umaid Bhawan and one evening they went out hunting with the help of Dushyant Singh
 is faisle ko lekar logon kii raay bhinn-bhinn he
 The Bishnoi community has praised it
 sarkaar ne kaha ki vah abhi bari kiye gaye logon ke khilaaf phir se yachika daalane par vichaar kar sakati he
 Many Salman fans and some film stalwarts have termed the punishment as overly strict
 unka kahana tha ki salmaan pehle bhi kai varshon tak bahut jhel chuke hai or apane daankaryon, sangrakshan kii disha main kar rahe lagaataar prayaason se unhone yah darshaya he ki unke swabhaav main bahut sudhaar aa chukaa he tathaa ab ve saamaajik or jimmedaripurn kaaryon main sakriy rahete hai
 This case has made the minds of people that hunting of wildlife is banned and in India it is considered a serious crime
 saf ali khan ke pita cricketer mansoor ali khan pataudi par bhi kuch saal pehle chinkaara maarane ke aarope main cese chalaa tha
 Despite this, incidents of hunting continue
 yah kaam zyaadaatar raison dwaara bas junglee jaanavar kaa maance khaane ke lobh main yaa phir paise ke laalach main peshewar aparaadhiyon dwaara kiya jaataa he
 In the coming years, Salman Khan will be acquitted from the upper courts or he will be punished, time will tell but one thing is clear that celebrities in India never confess their crimes
 isaki kai vajahen hai
 Firstly, there is no provision of any kind of deal (plea-bargain) on the punishment of crime, through which punishment can be reduced even in serious criminal cases
 doosraa, aparaadh kii sweekaarokti par bhartiya samaaj main maafee kaa bhav nahin he
 He treats such people very harshly
 teesraa kaaran yah he ki celebrity aparaadhiyon ke man main kahin na kahin yah baat chalati rahati he ki ve apane rasookh, apane paise kii badaulat antat isse batch niklenge
 The thing should not end with Salman Khan's punishment
 adatan shikari or peshewar shikariyon ko bhi isi tarah kanoon ke saamne ghutanon ke bal laa khadaa karke kathor sajaa deni hogi, tabhi is par lagaam lag sakati he

 mumbai ke kings cirkil par lagane vaala jiesbi pandal bhi kisi bhi maamle main kisi duusare pandal se kam nahin
 In this pandal Viraje Bappa is also called the God of fulfilling desires

 In this pandal, the city's famous Dar devotees come to see and worship

 pichley saal in sabhi jevaraton kii beemaa raashi 7 karod ke aasapaas thi
 But this time the price of gold and silver has increased, so the insurance amount has been increased to about 13 crores
 jiske liye jiesbi seva ganesh mandal new india insurance ko kareeb dhai lakh se zyada kaa premium de rahaa he
 According to Dinesh Pai, president of GSB Seva Ganesh Mandal, this time the price of gold has gone up considerably, this year has increased the jewelery of jewelery by about 10 kg in decoration
 beemaa chor lutere, antkavaadi, tod-phod yaa phir prakritik nuksaan jaise har vaardaat ko beemaa cover kar letaa he

 Even though both these players were not punished by the ICC in the James anderson-ravindra Jadeja fights, the controversy is still not taking the name of calm and new revelations are coming in it
 jharkhand cricket sangh ke adhyaksh subodhakant sahay or cricket association of bihar ke sachiv aditya verma ne en shrinivasana par gambhir aarope lagaate hue kaha ki isisi chairman ne apni kursi bachaane ke liye england ke tej gendbaaj ko clin chit dilwane main ahm bhoomika nibhaai
 Sahay said, 'N Srinivasan, who became the ICC chairman under controversial circumstances, played the role of a puppet master from behind the scenes and the BCCI was negligent in the jadeja-anderson case
 ' shrinivasana or bisisiai main unke gut ke kaaran bharat vishwa str par hansi kaa paatr ban gaya
 Anderson was accused of having abused and pushed Jadeja for lunch on the second day of the first Test cricket match between India and England in Nottingham
 isisi nyaayik ayog ne haalanki in donon khiladiyon ko nirdosh qaraar diya
 Sahay said, "srinivasan allowed the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) and ICC to hijack this issue in their favor
 ' agar bhartiya captain mahendra singh dhoni par vishwaas kiya jaae, to anderson ne jadeja ke liye apshabd kahe the
 According to reports, Anderson also admitted that he had misbehaved, but the ICC declared him clean and all this happened while Srinivasan was at the helm
 purv kendriya mantri sahay ne aarope lagaaya ki shrinivasana ne apni kursi bachaane ke liye anderson ko sajaa nahin hone di
 He said, 'did Srinivasan fear that the ECB and Cricket Australia would oust him because they know that he has wrongly become the ICC chairman
 is maamle main to yahi lagata he ki shrinivasana or isibi ke bich koi samjhauta ho gaya tha, jisase anderson ko sajaa nahin mili
 The BCCI appealed against the decision of the Judicial Commission Chairman Gordon Lewis but was rejected by the ICC
 board ne iske baad isisi aachaar samhita main badlaav ke liye kaha tha, lekin khud shrinivasana ne kaha ki isaki jarurat nahin he
 Sahay said, "srinivasan was talking about a radical change in the ICC, but now the same Srinivasan is saying that there is no need to change the ICC code of conduct
 ' unhone isisi kii sunwaayee main sundar raman or sudarshan raja ko bisisiai ke pratinidhi ke rup main bhejne par bhi aapatti jataai
 Sahai and Verma then appealed to former board presidents Sharad Pawar and Jagmohan Dalmiya to take the initiative to prevent Srinivasan's dummy candidate from coming to the top post in the board elections next month
 verma ne kaha, 'is baar bisisiai adhyaksh purvi kshetra se banegaa lekin shrinivasana apana dami ummidwar is pad par bithaane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 We appeal to Pawar and Dalmia to come forward to save the BCCI

 In Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand, the state government is taking swift action on the deaths of more than 100 people by drinking poisonous liquor, but in the meantime, the question is also being raised in everyone's mind that after all what is mixed with this poisonous liquor Gaya that put more than 100 people to death
 rajya ke aabkaari mantri jai pratap singh ne bhi mana ki aabkaari vibhaag se badi chook hui he or yah ashanka bhi jataai ki kahin sharaab main chuuhe maarane vaali dawa to nahin milaai gai thi, isaki jaanch kii ja rahi he

 He also believed that the connivance or negligence of the police is responsible for it somewhere
 police ko jimmedaar maanate hue kushinagar or saharanpur se lekar kai jagahon par darjanon police ke log nilambit kiye gaye hai
 According to Jai Pratap Singh, the dead people in Deoband, Saharanpur had consumed poisonous liquor during a function in Uttarakhand, only after returning from where did their health deteriorate and after that the process of death started
 unke mutabik sarkari aankade ke taur par abhi tak sirf 36 logon kii maut kii pushti hui he, lekin yah aankada bad bhi saktaa he
 According to the minister, it is not yet clear what was found in the poisonous liquor, due to which it proved so fatal

 There is no district of Uttar Pradesh where number two liquor is not sold

 The Congress won here in the 2018 assembly elections, along with the support of some other parties

 doctor ne turant hi dengue kaa test karaane ko kaha jo positive aayaa
 Was asked to monitor platelets daily, but the vomiting, vertigo, weakness started
 bukhaar jo utarane kaa naam na le
 But Tanya did not admit in the hospital until the platelets reached below 30 thousand
 galat kiya
 He was immediately admitted to the ICU
 agali subah jab naak se khun bahane laga tab doctor ne fouran fresh platelet chadhaane ko kaha
 The situation was quite critical
 jise kehete hai tach and go
 In any case, fresh platelets came and went well
 tanya 4 din baad jab discharge hokar ghar pahunchin to ek maheene tak kaaphi kamjor thim
 Since then, she is wary of mosquitoes throughout the year
 chaahe subah ho yaa raat
 He had come to know that a mosquito can also be fatal and dengue can come again and again, anytime of the year
 isse saal bhar bachane kii jarurat hoti he
 The second anecdote is also associated with the learned Simran
 simran ke 5 saal ke bete ko bukhaar ho gaya tha
 Neither was able to eat, nor was able to sleep
 bas bukhaar main tadapata rahata tha
 Just kept suffering in fever and kept crying
 simran ke sasur ji ne kaha ki shaayad bete ko dengue ho gaya he
 When Simran talked about going to the doctor, everyone said that he will do unnecessary tests, give expensive medicines, home prescriptions will get the son right soon
 lekin bete kii haalat bigadati rahi, lagaataar kharaab hoti rahi
 Then one day he suddenly fainted
 halki saans le rahaa tha
 Seeing all this, Simran's husband forcefully took her to the doctor
 acha kiya unhone varanaa bete kii shaayad jaan na batch paati
 His platelets had reached 10,000
 isiu main use bhartee kiya gaya
 Platelets were plated after blood tests and then the condition improved
 10 din tak wo hospital main hi rahaa
 Simran's son had become so weak that after several days he could take a solid diet
 kaaphi din tak wo liquid diet par hi rahaa
 Simran decided from the same day that she would protect her child from mosquito for 12 months and if anything happens, go directly to the doctor
 ek machhar se bhi lene ke dene pad sakate hai
 
 
 It is important to avoid
 tanya or simran ke sankat ko jaanakar aap bhi ye samaj hi gaye honge ki dengue darasal 12 maheene kii beemaari he sirf barsaat kii hi nahin
 a mosquito sting is enough to get you caught by dengue
 or agar aap ek baar dengue ke daur se guzar chuke hai to iskaa ye matlab nahin ki aapako ye dobaaraa nahin ho saktaa he
 Understand that Prevention is better than Cure
 dengue se bachane ke liye aap immunity badhaane vaale food khaaie, eksrasij kariye, asi vent yaa flower pots main pani na jamaa ho
 Dengue is not only a matter of hygiene but it is also important to be careful
godrej Kala Hit can prove to be a perfect weapon for you to protect against dengue se bachaav ke liye godarej kala hit aapke liye ek achook astr sabit ho saktaa he
 The power of this spray of Godrej kills mosquitoes hidden in every corner of the house
 or aap hi nahin balki aapkaa baccha bhi chaiyn kii neend sota he

 He (opposition group) is forming another party
 ramgopal se naaraaz mulimmulaayam ramgopal yadav par khaase naaraaz dikhe or kaha ki vah bahut pehle se hi motorcycle chunaav chinh ke saath akhil bhartiya samaajawaadee party banane main lage the

 jab se shahid kapur, aalia bhatta, karina kapur or dilajit dosanjh kii film 'udata punjab' kaa trailor relies hua he tab se industry main phans main isaki jamkar charchaa ho rahi he
 The trailer of the film has been watched by over 4 million people so far
 soshal media par hit ho rahe is trailor main sabhi actors mjedaar kirdaaron main najar aa rahe hai
 Recently in the film, it is reported that Shahid's rockstar character Tommy Singh is based on rap star Yo Honey Singh
 haalanki is baat se filmmekars ne inkaar kiya he
 Based on the world of drugs in Punjab, the film featured Tommy Singh as the character of a well-known rockstar who is at the height of his career but indulging in drugs
 film kii unit se jude ek sutara ne angreji akhbaar diene ko bataaya ki is film rockstar se judi har baat punjabi rock star hani singh se milti julati he, to kahin naa kahin unki chhavi to aani hi he
 Well i would like to say that Shahid Kapoor's character is more wild and angry than Yo Yo Honey Singh
 yah kirdaar ek wild kirdaar he jo drugs main buri tarah se duba hua he
 There is also another special reason to associate Shahid's rockstar character with Yo Yo Honey Singh
 darasal jis tarah trailor main tommy singh ko kaamyaab hote hue bhi drugs main leen dikhaaya gaya he vaise hi kuch mahine pehle yo yo hani singh kaa bhi yahi haal bataaya gaya tha
 Jabhani Singhka was named as the top rap star in Bollywood, when suddenly he took a U-turn from his career and disappeared from the industry for almost 18 months
 isaki vajah yah bataai gai ki hani singh drugs kii lat ke chalate chandigarh ke ek rihabilieshan centre main apana ilaaj karvaa rahe hai
 But Honey Singh himself says that he succumbed to bipolar disorder
 lekin'udata punjab'main tommy singh kaa kirdaar vaaki yo yo hani singh par besd he, yah to vakt aane par hi pataa chalegaa

 He is yet to play the full 50 overs of the ODI match
 sahvaag ne kaha, ‘mujhe lagata he ki maineek divasiy cricketmen kabhi 50 over nahin khele hai
 So far i have played 43 or 44 overs
 lekin is baar main 50 over tak ballebaaji or team ko acchhee shuruuaat dene kii koshish karuunga
 i have been trying to bat for 50 overs for the last 10 years and have failed but the effort is still going on
 ’is baar kaaphi ummiden lagaayi ja rahi hai lekin sahvaag ne kaha ki vah dabaav mahasoos nahin kar rahe kyonki captain mahendra singh dhoni or coach gairi karston ne unhen apana naiysargik khel khilne ko kaha he, bhale hi halaat kuch bhi hon
 Sehwag said, 'nobody is telling me what i have to do, it is a good thing for our team
 coach or captain ne mujhe waisi ballebaaji karne ko kaha he jaisi main karata hum
 That is why they are not increasing any pressure on me
 unhone sirf itnaa kaha he ki apana naiysargik khel khelo
 If you can score runs, then we will be happy but even if you cannot do it, we will be happy
 ’sahvaag ne kaha, ‘meri bhoomika krij par utarkar team ko acchhee shuruuaat karaane kii he
 If i score 20 runs in 10 balls or 100 runs in 70 or 80 balls, then i am happy with it
 ’ is 32 varshiya kii style krij par utarate hi aakraamak ravaiya akhriyaar karne kii he lekin sahvaag ne kaha ki unhone apni aakraamak pravriti ko thodaa kam kar diya he
 He said, 'I have been doing well for the last three years and i have also made some changes
 ab main nayi gend ko thodaa sammaan detaa hum
 i make sure that i play four-five overs before dominating the bowlers and then try to give the team a good start
 ’ sahvaag ne kaha, ‘main jaanata hum ki madhyakram main hamaare paas dhoni, viraat kohli, yusuf pathan, yuvaraj singh or suresh raina maujuud hai isaliye main pehali gend se aakraamak ho saktaa hum
 But now after playing three-four overs, i make sure that i give the team a good start
 ’vah test main bharat ke liye kaaphi ran bator chuke hai lekin paanch divasiy mukaable kii tulana main vanade main unka ricard itnaa prabhavit karne vaala nahin he
 But the statistics have no effect on Sehwag and he says that his contribution is important for the success of the team
 unhone kaha, ‘main vanade cricket main apane pradarshan se khush hum
 This is because everyone is talking about that my test average is 54 while the ODI average is just 35 but it does not make my performance look bad
 ’ sahvaag ne kaha, ‘haa maine jo pradarshan kiya he, main usase behatar kar saktaa hum lekin main khush hum
 i am constantly focusing on doing well in ODI cricket
 lekin jab tak main team ke liye yogadan karata hum, main khush hum
 When asked if he has fully recovered from a shoulder injury, he said, "I am taking regular treatment and hopefully i will be fully recovered
" ’ kandhe kii chot kii chintaaon ke baavjood unhone kaha ki vah vishwa cap main gendbaaji karenge lekin puri tarah se feet hone ke baad hi vah aisa karenge
 He said, 'of course i want to bowl
 main team india ke liye yogadan dena chahta hum

 The Election Commission has ruled in favor of Akhilesh
 ab se cycle or sapa akhilesh ke ishaaron par chalegi
 As soon as the decision of the Election Commission came, there was a wave of happiness in the Akhilesh camp and on the other hand, the Mulayam camp looked disappointed
 faisla aane ke turant baad akhilesh yadav apane pita mulaayam se milane gaye or aashirwad liya
 Akhilesh knew that his side is strong, perhaps that was the reason why all the attempts at reconciliation proved insufficient
 ab mulaayam or shivpal ke paas kuch hi vikalp bache hai
 Let's have a look
 
 
 akhilesh kii baat maan lensbase pehla vikalp he ki ve chunaav ayog kaa faisla maan len or party ke rashtriya adhyaksh ke taur par apane bete akhilesh yadav ko aashirwad den
 Apart from this, take the responsibility of the new post 'party Guardian' given in the Emergency National Session
 isse party bhi majboot hogi or unka rajnatik mahatv bhi barkaraar rahegaa
 Can go to court Mulayam's election symbol There is still a choice left to present his claim on the bicycle
 ve chahen to court me chunaav ayog ke faisle ko chalange kar sakate hai
 But, the notification of the first phase is going on before Tuesday, in this case, Mulayam will not get any immediate relief from this, though it may be that the cycle will freeze
 haalanki donon pakshon ne yah baat kahi thi ki chunaav ayog kaa jo bhi faisla aayega maanya hoga
 The new party will have to take initiative If Mulayam has to enter the electoral fray with his camp, then Mulayam will now have to appeal to the Election Commission for a new party and election symbol
 mulaayam khemaa agar nai party banaata he to isse donon hi khemon ko vidhansabha chunaavon main nuksaan hoga
 Go to central politics Shivpal Yadav, former state president of Shivpalaspa and uncle of Akhilesh Yadav, can now go into central politics
 akhilesh yadav pehle unhen cabinet mantrimandal se or rashtriya adhiveshan main pradesh adhyaksh ke pad se hataa chuke hai
 Now they have central politics as the last option
 yuva peedi ko karen agechunaav ayog ke faisle ke baad ab mulaayam or shivpal ke paas aakhri vikalp ke taur par yuva peedi ko uttaradhikaar saunpane kaa rasta bachaa hua he
 Mulayam has already made Akhilesh the patron of the party, now Shivpal Yadav should also contest his son Aditya Yadav from his traditional seat Jaswantnagar

 He pleaded with the Pakistani ruler to send his brother out of Pakistan for good treatment

 Still she kept fighting

 To avoid the burning of the killer Pakistan
 apane begunaah bhai kii maut to dalbir ko hameshaa salti rahegi
 But all these days it has been seen that without a high grip, just because of her own will, a sister made the issue of brother's life the question of the whole of India

 Mudra loan is of course 7%, but that too is a matter of great concern

 court ne or vistaar se ise samajhaayaa ki enjio yaa sanstha ko madad kaa paimaana har maamle ke tathyon ke hisaab se hoga
 There may be many cases where the financial assistance is more than 50 per cent, but they cannot be called fat help
 kalpana kiijie kisi enjio kii puunji 10,000 ru
 And he gets Rs 5000
 kii grat milti he to use motaa anshdaan nahin kaha jayega
 But if an NGO or institution takes a grout of crores of rupees and it is less than 50 per cent, then it will be called a big financial help
 jaahir he is faisle ke baad sarkaar se grant yaa riyayati jameen yaa kisi anya tarah se madad lene vaale enjio, aspataal, shikshan santhaan aadi artiai ke tahat aaenge
 But experts say that ngos and institutions will continue to avoid this until a system of strict implementation of the decision is made
 jane-maane artiai activist subhash agarwal kehete hai ki kendriya soochna ayog bhi pehle is tarah ke faisle sunaata rahaa he
 But the attitude of the institutions remains hanging
 ve siisi ke faisle ke khilaaf hoicourt se ste le aate hai
 Regarding this decision, Agarwal says, if an NGO is not taking government assistance, then it will not come under the purview of ITI
 agarwal salaah dete hai ki is faisle kaa asar tab padegaa jab sarkaar grant yaa madad main artiai ke daayre main aane kii shart anivaary kar de
 Another advice they make is that all the Central and State government building departments should make a list of buildings and institutions that have been given land concession and ask them to enforce the Right to Information otherwise their allotment is canceled
 darasal, bisisiai jaise kuch santhaan hameshaa artiai ke daayre se kisi na kisi tarah bachate rahe hai kyonki yahaan rajanetaaon kaa jamghat or aarthik hit hote hai
 The government should bring them under the purview of Right to Information

 train main savaar ek mahila ko paanch yuvakon ne jamkar peeta
 The woman has suffered serious injuries

 deshbhar main ek july se jiesti lagu karte samaye kendra sarkaar ne daawa kiya ki ise lagu karne ke baad sabase bada phayda companiyon ko milegaa
 The production companies across the country will get a chance to reduce their freight cost by 20% in the GST regime
 lekin jiesti lagu hone ke chauthe maheene main companiyon ko koi phayda najar nahin aa rahaa he
 It is worth noting that Road Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari had claimed that the benefit of GST to the transport sector can be gauged from the fact that after the GST is implemented, the inter-state check post is not required by the tax department
 kyonki maal se laden trek par rajyon ke darjanon cells tex jiesti main samahit ho jaaenge
 Therefore, the goods will be wired in a factory, at the same time the GST paper of its journey will be ready at the time of loading the truck, which will not need to be checked or updated during the journey
 kaaran yah ki ek rajya se duusare rajya or ek shahar se duusare shahar tak bharat main factory ke saamaan se ladaa trek kitne checkpost par rukegaa yah koi nahin jaanata tha
 This will change with GST
 desh ke kisi kone main factory se maal lad kar niklaa trek duusare kone main bina roak-tok pahunch gaya to jiesti kaa phayda trek par lage ek-ek saamaan ko milegaa- factory se bazaar tak maal pahunchane kii laagat main katautee dekhne ko milegi
 Transport sector companies claim that they saw the benefit of removing check posts by the states in early July only
 lekin isse pehle ki yah unhen koi phayda pahunchaata, zyaadaatar rajyon main cells tex vibhaagon ke mobile daston ne jagah-jagah gadiyon ko rokkar kagajaat check karne kii nai prakriya shuru kar di
 Also read: GST will end business of number-2: Before implementing Gadkari GST, the Union Minister had also argued that while a truck in America travels 3 lakh km in a year, in contrast a truck in India It is able to travel only 50 to 60 thousand kilometers per year
 vahiin prati din ke mutabik jiesti lagu hone se pehle jahaan bharat main ek trek din main lagbhag 250-300 kilometre kaa safar tay karata tha vahiin america main 450 kilometre or vaishvik ausat 800 kilometre tha
 Now, after the implementation of GST in the country, there has been an increase of just 40-50 km per day
 lekin yah ijapha companiyon ke liye kisi tarah kaa phayda lekar nahin aayaa kyonki is dauraan vaishvik bazaar main kachche tel kii keemton main ijaphe ne companiyon ke kharch ko badha diya he
 Also read: After the implementation of Prime Minister Modi GST, which has been strengthened by weakening the Chief Ministers in three years, this will lead to a big reduction in the travel time of goods-laden trucks in the country
 vahiin jiesti ke tahat prastaavit i-bill vyavastha se 50,000 rupee se adhik ke saamaan kaa online registration trakon dwaara maujuuda samay main liye ja samay ko or kam kar degaa
 At the same time, along with these changes in the transport sector, the improved highway condition across the country will also increase the demand for big container trucks in the country, so that more and more products will reach the market in the shortest time
 kai charan ke waite kii jagah deshbhar main single jiesti kaa ek or bada phayda logistic main yah hoga ki ab companiyon ko alag-alag rajyon main vishesh warehouse rakhane kii jarurat nahin hogi
 Earlier, due to different tax rates in different states, companies had to build special warehouses in every state
 ab jiesti lagu hone ke baad companiyon par aisi baadhyataa nahin rahegi
 It is worth noting that in India manufacturing logistics cost was 14% before GST
 jabaki duniya ke ahm deshon main yah cost mahaj 6-8 fisadi aati he
 The central government hopes that due to GST, now in India also the logistics cost will come down to the range of 10-12%, so that not only companies can sell the product at a lower price but also to increase their profits

 unke raajnneetik guru emji ramchandran ke nidhan ke baad bhi aisi hi paristhiti utpan hui thi or tab jayalalita ne swayan nae dhade kaa netritv kiya tha
 Today, under the leadership of Jayalalithaa's confidant Sasikala, the party stands at the same mouth
 maut se pehle hi chhidaa ghamasabhi ammaa ke maut kii pushti bhi nahin kii gai thi lekin party main uthapatak chalati rahi
 On Monday, Chennai was immersed in political enthusiasts throughout the day
 annadramuk ke kaddavaar netaaon se shashikala dinabhar meeting karti raheen
 According to a report, on Monday afternoon, Sasikala called a meeting of all the mlas and ministers of the party but did not reach five veteran ministers including Chief Minister Panneerselvam
 vivaad yaheen se upja
 However all of them reached this meeting at 11 pm from where 30 mlas were taken directly to Raj Bhavan and formalities were completed before the Governor
 11
 The news of Jayalalithaa's demise came at 30 pm and 1 night
 30 baje mukhyamantri ke rup main paneerselvam ne shapath grahan kiya
 Silence before the storm The AIADMK party, which is battling political vacuum after the death of Chief Minister j Jayalalithaa, has pacified the inner commotion within the party by making Paneerselvam the chief minister, but it is silent before the storm Can
 je jayalalita ke kad ke aage party main ek bhi netaa number do kii kursi par kabhi virajman nahin dikhaa
 However, when Amma had to step down from the post of Chief Minister for some reasons, she continued to seat Panneerselvam on this chair
 ammaa ke baad shashikala sabase bada nachmma kii anupasthiti main bhale hi paneerselvam mukhyamantri banate rahe hai lekin jayalalita kii parchaai kahi jane vaali shashikala ab party ke bheetar sabase bada kad hai
 Sasikala Natarajan has never held any government or party position but since 1980 she has continuously wielded power indirectly as a partner of Jayalalithaa
 wo usee samudaay se aati he jisase mukhyamantri paneerselvam jo jayalalita ke daahine haath maane jate the
 Overall, after Jayalalithaa's departure, now 59-year-old Sasikala is considered to be the axis of the power-balance of the Anna DMK party in Tamil Nadu, and in the coming years, she will decide who will hold power there
 laut aae shashikala ke pati natarajanjayalalita kii maut ke saath hi unke awaas poes garden main shashikala ke pati kii vaapasi bhi ho gai he
 Jayatlitha, along with 13 other family members who were banned from entering by Jayalalitha himself, returned to the place and the market of speculations got heated
 shashikala ke pati sarkaar main piaaro the or unhone hi apni patni kaa jayalalita se parichay karavaaya tha
 What is Jayalalithaa's Sasikala connection? Since this introduction in 1980, Sasikala became extremely close to Jayalalithaa but in 2011 her family was not only evicted from Jayalalithaa's residence but also expelled from the party
 saath hi shashikala ke pati ko 2012 main jayalalita sarkaar ne jail bhej kar raajnneeti se dur kar diya tha
 However, in March 2012, Jayalalithaa withdrew Sasikala's written apology and condition of being completely away from the family
 ab unki mrityu ke baad pichley paanch saalon se shant baithe shashikala ke pati kii sakriy raajnneeti main phir vaapasi hoti hui dikhti he
 Tamil politics will be taken over by Mannargudi Mafia? Not only Sasikala's husband but also her brother Diwaharan, Nand j Elavarasi, son Vivek, sister Priya, nephew Venkatesh and Mahadevan and niece's husband Shivkumar are back in Poise Garden
 shashikala ko jaanane vaale yah maanate hai ki unki raajnneetik soch unke pati ke anusaar chalati he
 With this, the already very strong Mannargudi community is going to dominate Tamil Nadu politics once again
 varisht netaa is baat kii kayaas to jayalalita ke apollo aspataal main bhartee hone ke saath hi lagane lage the
 Natarajan's plan is to tell everyone that Amma wanted to succeed Sasikala and at the same time wants to monopolize her legacy
 haalanki party ke ek varisht netaa kaa kahana he ki aisa hone vaala nahin he
 The DMK, bjp's view on activities, meanwhile, is tense between Sasikala and her rival camp, which will not allow the Mannargudi mafia to sit on the throne easily
 anna dramuk ke vibhinn dhade iske liye daawa karne vaale hai
 Experts say that this is the reason that Anna DMK is on the path of tearing once again
 ab jabaki sattarudh party bantwaare ke kagaar par he to vipakshi dal diemke or bijepi unki gatividhiyon par ankhe gadaaye baithe hai
 What is the game plan of Paneerselvam? Among all these, what is the game plan of Chief Minister Paneerselvam? 1987 main jab mjiaar ke nidhan ke baad unki party do dhade main bant gai
