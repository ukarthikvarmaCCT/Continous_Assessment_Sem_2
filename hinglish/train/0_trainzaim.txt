 Even before the first vote was cast in Bihar's Banka, even before the first nomination was filed from this parliamentary constituency for the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, this remote district of Bihar is waiting for a suitable answer to its question
 sawaal haih bihar kii raajnneeti ke ek-duusare ke hi virdohi dalon-janata dal united (jad-you) or rashtriya janata dal (rajd)-ne baankaa se loksabhaa chunaav ke liye prabal daavedaar maane jane vaale do diggaj raajnneetikon ko tikat kyon nahin die?kya aisa do ''bahari'' logon ke liye jagah banane kii khatir kiya gaya he? yaa phir asal kaaran in partiyon ne jo kuch kaha usase aage kii baat he? kis prakaar lalu prasad yadav or nitish kumaar ko ek saath hi is tarah kaa chokha vichaar aayaa?jad (you) ne purv kendriya mantri or varisht netaa digvijay singh ko baankaa se tikat dene se inkaar kar diya
 He has won two of the last three Lok Sabha elections from Banka
 rajd ne bhi baankaa se apane vartmaan saansad girdhaari yadav kii upeksha kaa faisla liya or kendriya mantri jaiprakash narayan yadav ko yahaan se chunavi maidan main utaara gaya
 After the delimitation, Munger's electoral arithmetic required Jayaprakash to secure a seat, not only this, the boundary of Banka parliamentary constituency has also been re-determined due to delimitation
 jamui jile ke do vidhansabha kshetra chakai or jhaasa ab baankaa seat kaa hissaa nahin rahe hai
 However, this did not affect JD (U) 's intentions to make Jhajha MLA and Bihar Social Welfare Minister Damodar Raut a candidate from Banka
 yahi vah tasviir maani jaati he jisaki duhai jad (you) ke netaaon ne digvijay singh kii tikat kaatane ke liye di he
 He says that the face of Banka parliamentary constituency has changed completely now
 lekin raut-parisemen ke baad jinka vidhansabha kshetra baankaa se chhin gaya he-ko baankaa se utaarne ke jad (you) ke faisle or digvijay singh ko tikat na dena chunavi ganit se aage kii baat maani ja sakati he
 Not getting tickets also did not affect the motives of these two veteran leaders of Banka seat
 digvijay singh or yadav donon ne hi party ke aadesh ko maanane se inkaar kar diya
 While the Congress gave shelter to rjd's sepoy Yadav, Digvijay Singh filed nomination from Banka as an independent candidate
 sanyog se, digvijay singh or yadav baankaa kii raajnneeti kii do dhuriyaan rahe hai or dashak bhar se bhi adhik samay se donon hi ke bich sansadeey raajnneeti or baankaa ke matadaataaon kaa rujhaan banta rahaa he
 The dominance of these two giants in the Banka region cannot be challenged
 tabhi to shakuni choudhary (1999) ko chhodkar anya jisane bhi in donon ke khilaaf pichley teen chunaav main khadey hone kaa saahas kiya he, unki jamaanat bhi jabt ho gai he
 Both of them secured 95 per cent of Banka's total votes in the 2004 general election
 haalanki inkaa aankada 1999 main 71 fisadi par pahunch gaya tha
 It was probably because Yadav contested as an independent
 1998 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bhi digvijay singh or yadav ne milakar 93 fisadi maton par kabja kiya tha
 Digvijay Singh won the Banka Lok Sabha seat in 1998 and 1999 while Yadav won from 1996 and 2004
 2004 ke chunaav main digvijay singh maatr 4,669 maton ke antaraal se chunaav haar gaye the
 Digvijay Singh may have bet on the Rajya Sabha membership to contest elections, presumably given his impressive record
 isamen koi tajjub nahin ki ve khud ko lekar har tarah se aashwast hai
 Digvijay Singh told India Today, "I don't see any challenge here
 main chunaav isliye lard rahaa hum kyonki mere log aisa chaahate hai
 i have to take many unfinished tasks to their end
 ''unhen is baat kaa dhyaan rakhana hoga ki logon kii sahanubhuti hi jeetne ke liye kaaphi nahin he
 Apart from his arch-rival Yadav, he has to face Jayaprakash and Raut too
 jahaan raut atyadhik pichhadi jati ke voton ke alaava nitish kumaar ke chamatkaar par aas lagaae baithe hai, vahiin jaiprakash is baat ko lekar ashanvit hai ki lalu kaa muslim-yadav samarthan or dalit vot unki naiya ko paar laga denge
 The good news for Digvijay is, of course, that he is well aware of the strength of his opponents
 yah bhi koi hairat kii baat nahin ki prachaar ke dauraan vah ekadam aatmavishvaas se labarej dikhte hai
 They are very prompt among the voters
 ve kehete hai, ''main ek saath do ladaaiyaan lard rahaa hum
 i am not only contesting elections for my self-respect, but also want to make the district multi-faceted
 '' jagannatha mishra sareekhe netaa unke liye pehle hi baankaa main prachaar kar chuke hai
 His supporters do not forget to tell everyone that for Banka he has also renounced his Rajya Sabha membership
 kya rajyasabha kii sadsyta tyaagna unke liye phaayde kaa sauda he? agar ve chunaav jitate bhi hai to bhi sirf ek saansad hi honge joki ve rajyasabha kii sadsyta se istipha dene se pehle bhi the
 Has Digvijay become a visionary or a small entrepreneur? a section of political analysts supports Digvijay Singh's decision as he would have been marginalized if he stayed in the party after the JD (U) decision not to give him a ticket
 
 vishleshkon kaa maananaa he ki jad (you) netritv ne unke saamne or koi rasta nahin choda tha, vaise bhi party netritv jorge furnandis ke saath pehle hi kaaphi kuch kar chukaa tha
 He had the option of being a member of the Rajya Sabha for two years
 unke paas vikalp tha ki ve 2011 main apane rajnatik kareer ko bachaae rakhane ke liye in do saalon main jamkar taiyaari karte
 But Digvijay Singh decided to face the crisis
 yah saaf he ki unka faisla rajya ke rajnatik paridrishy main haashiye par jane se bachane ke liye liya gaya he
 When Fernandes split the Janata Dal and formed the Samata Party in 1994, Digvijay Singh was one of the founding members of the party along with Nitish Kumar
 baad main, unhone furnandis ke saath samta party kaa jad (you) main vilay kar liya or bhaajapa netritv vaale rajg gathbandhan kaa nirmaan kiya
 But now the bet has changed completely
 ise sanyog hi kahenge ki abhi tak baankaa sansadeey kshetra se koi bhi saansad teesri baar chunakar loksabhaa pahunchane kaa saubhaahgya hasil nahin kar sakaa he
 But both Digvijay Singh and Yadav have united in 2009 to make history
 dekhnaa yah he ki pehle tikdi jamaane kaa shrey kis netaa kii jholii main jaataa he, yaa phir baaji kisi or ke haath hi lagati he
 Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni may be under pressure as captain, but his opponents are also counting him as one of the best finishers in ODI cricket due to his ability to carry his match down the order in batting
 aankadon or tulanaatmak rup se kaaphi tathy maujuud hai, jo dhoni ko shandaar finishr banaate hai
 Apart from this, he has also done 189 catches, 69 stumpings and many run outs, while also playing the role of captain
 srilanka ke captain mahela jayavardhane us samay vishwaas hi nahin kar paae, jab dhoni ne match taai karvaa diya
 The comments unhone kaha, ‚Äò‚Äòagar aap gend ko ek inch idhar yaa udhar phenkate ho to dhoni jaisaa khilaadi aapaki pareshaani badha saktaa he
 He is a great finisher, he plays with patience and patience
 ‚Äô‚Äô The figures are also in support of Dhoni

 Scored at an average of 89

 There is a lot of data and comparative facts that make Dhoni a great finisher
 iske alaava unhone 189 kaich, 69 stamping or kai ran out bhi kiye hai, jabaki captaini kii bhoomika bhi nibhaate hai
 Sri Lankan captain Mahela Jayawardene could not believe it when Dhoni got the match tied
 tippaniyan He said, "if you throw the ball an inch here or there, then a player like Dhoni can increase your problem
 vah shandaar finishr he, vah dhairya or sanyam ke saath kheltaa he
 '' aankade bhi dhoni ke samarthan main hai
 In the 49 matches India won in the presence of Dhoni chasing the target, this wicket-keeper batsman was unbeaten 30 times and 104 during this time
 89 kii ausat se ran banaae
 Dhoni's top opponents Michael Bevan, Lance Klusner, Abdul Razzaq and Jonty Rhodes are not even close to average
 unhone kaha, ‚Äò‚Äòagar aap gend ko ek inch idhar yaa udhar phenkate ho to dhoni jaisaa khilaadi aapaki pareshaani badha saktaa he
 He is a great finisher, he plays with patience and patience

 maharashtra kii siyasat ke bahubali sabit hue sharad pavarpawar ke aage chaaron khaane chit hue devendra fadanvisapavaar ne hataa diya beti supriya kii siyaasi raah kaa kaantamaharashtra ke siyaasi sangram ke bich samvidhan diwas ke din bijepi ko supreme court se tagada jhatka laga
 As a result, Devendra Fadnavis had to resign as Chief Minister and Ajit Pawar as Deputy CM
 maharashtra kii siyasat ke betaj badshaah kahe jane vaale ensipi pramukh sharad pavaar ke power ke aage bijepi ke chanakya kaa daanv kaam nahin aa sakaa
 This proved that Bahubali of Maharashtra is only Sharad Pawar
 pradhanmantri narendra modi or bijepi adhyaksh va kendriya grih mantri amit shah ke aage desh ke ek se badhkar ek netaa apana siyaasi vajood ko bachaakar nahin rakh sake
 The political magic of these two leaders faded in the politics of Maharashtra
 vidhansabha chunaav ke bich pravartan nideshaalay (idi) ne jab ensipi pramukhsharad pavarper karrwai ke liye kadam uthaaya to maharashtra kaa yah boodha sher jaag uthaa
 However, all the veteran leaders of NCP had left together
 barish main bheegate hue kiya tha prachaaraise main akele pade 78 varshiya sharad pavaar ne dilli banaam maharashtra kii siyaasi lakeer khinch di or barish main bheegate hue chunaav prachaar kiya
 As a result, the NCP emerged as a kingmaker
 haalanki bijepi-shivasena ko spasht bahumat mila tha, lekin donon ke bich kursi kii ladaai main sharad pavaar ne apane siyaasi hunar kaa istemaal kiya
 He silently placed a hand on the Shiv Sena's shoulder
 isse shivasena ke hausale itane buland ho gaye ki usne bijepi se dashakon puraani dosti tod lee
 The Shiv Sena extended its hand to join the congress-ncp in Maharashtra, but Sharad Pawar was not opening his cards till the last moment
 iskaa nateeja yah hua ki governor ko maharashtra memrashtrapati shasnalgaana padaa
 Even after the imposition of President's rule, the congress-ncp-shiv Sena continued to hold political slang
 congress kii ore se bhi shivasena ke saath baat sharad pavaar hi karte rahe the
 The formula to form the government was decided on Friday (november 22) after several rounds of meetings between the three parties
 bijepi ne chalaa tha yah daanvcongress, ensipi or shivasena sarkaar banane kaa daawa rajyapal ko pesh karti, usase pehle hi shanivaar ko bijepi ne sharad pavaar ke bhattije ajit pavaar ko apane saath milakar sabko aashcharyachakit kar diya
 Overnight, he decided to end President's rule in Maharashtra
 shanivaar kii subah mumbai ke log sokar sahi se uth bhi nahin paae the kidevendra fadanvisane mukhyamantri pad kii or ajit pavaar ne dipti siem kii shapath thi
 All veteran BJP leaders including Prime Minister Narendra Modi had even congratulated the Devendra Fadnavis government
 ajit pavaar ke bijepi kheme main jane ke baad shanivaar ko congress-ensipi-shivasena baikfoot par najar aa rahi thi
 In such a situation, Sharad Pawar took command by staying in Mumbai
 haalanki bijepi yah daawa karti rahi ki hamaare paas 170 vidhayakon kaa samarthan he
 Despite this, Sharad Pawar started the exercise to bring back the NCP mlas who had gone with Ajit Pawar earlier
 saath hi ensipi-congress-shivasena ne supreme court main kanoonee ladaai bhi shuru kar di
 The Supreme Court gave this order, where hearing started in the Supreme Court on Sunday, Sharad Pawar started getting success in Maharashtra
 ajit pavaar ke saath gaye ensipi vidhayakon ne ek-ek kar sharad pavaar ke kheme main waapas aana shuru kar diya
 By evening, Sharad Pawar had united 49 mlas out of 56 NCP mlas and replaced Jayant Patil as the new leader of the legislature party in place of Ajit Pawar
 sharad pavaar ne ensipi netaaon ko ajit pavaar kii ghar vaapasi karaane kii muhim main laga diya
 Meanwhile, from Chhagan Bhujbal to Jayant Patil, the conversation started with Ajit Pawar
 is tarah se sharad pavaar nebijepike manobal ko kamjor karnaa shuru kiya
 On Monday, Sharad Pawar demonstrated strength by uniting a total of 162 mlas including the Shiv sena-congress-ncp at the Hyatt Hotel in Mumbai
 iske jariye sharad pavaar ne yah sabit karne kii koshish kii ki bahumat kaa aankada bijepi ke saath nahin balki unke saath he
 Ajit got hold of the weak Sharad Pawar with his political bets made many problems easy
 bhattije ajit pavaar ne bijepi ke saath jaakar ensipi main apni pakad ko kamjor kar liya he
 In such a situation, now Sharad Pawar has managed to establish his political heir unquestionably Supriya Suleko
 saath sharad pavaar ne shivasena ke netritv vaali sarkaar banane kaa shrey bhi apane naam kar liya he, kyonki puure seen main vahi najar aa rahe the
 He has also lost his base by resigning from the post of Deputy CM after the Supreme Court verdict
 saath hi ab bijepi dobaaraa se maharashtra main sarkaar banane kaa daanv bhi ab nahin chal sakegi
 In this way, the political game of bjp's Operation Lotus failed with Sharad Pawar's maneuver

 The incident in Unnao is the beginning of a very inferior phase of infiltration in our society and politics, leave the cacophony of our own leaders-parties-ideas-camps and start thinking about the law-system-decorum of this country

 devendra fadanvis ke netritv vaali yah sarkaar mangalvaar ko gir gai jab ajit pavaar ne ‚Äò‚Äònijee kaarnon'' kaa hawala dete hue upmukhyamantri pad se istipha de diya tha
 Raut told reporters here, "BJP could not make its Chief Minister in Maharashtra despite its 'aghori' efforts
 aisa isliye hua kyonki maharashtra ke logon main rosh he
 "the Rajya Sabha member said," Change is beginning in Maharashtra
 
 
 maharashtra ne desh ko nayi subah dikhaai he
 Raut said that people did not trust him earlier when he said that the 'suryan' of the Shiv Sena would land safely on the sixth floor of the ministry (secretariat)
 iskaa matlab he ki party rajya main apana mukhyamantri banaaegi
 The Chief Minister's office is located here on the sixth floor of the State Secretariat

 i will not address you (media) from tomorrow

 Thackeray will take oath of Chief Minister on Thursday evening at Shivaji Park in Dadar area
 ek acchhee baat failaane chaliye sari jindagi guzar jaaegi sirf das log kaan or unamem se bhi do dhyaan denge
 But if there is any rumor, then it will come back by adding ten new facts from one mouth to another by evening
 aisa hi kuch hua baraak obama ke bharat daure ke saath
 The first thing was revealed that Obama is not bringing his daughters to India this time
 saath hi afvaah ye sunai di ki iske peeche vajah modi ji kaa dar he
 Recently he has given statements about teaching daughters
 aise maukey par agar obama bich satr main skool se chuttee dilaakar betiyon ko bharat laate to dar tha kahin modi airport par hi unhen bacchiyon kii padhai main baadha banane ke liye daptne na lag jaaen
 The second reason was told that Malia does not want anyone to think that she is Alia's sister
 saath hi donon bahanon ne brazil daure par narendra modi ko laad main bachche ke kaan umethte bhi dekha tha or tabase bharat aane ke naam par hi unhen haad kaa bukhaar aa jaataa he
 Amidst these rumors, the funniest reason for most of the girls not coming to India is being told that Michelle did not want her daughters on the streets of America after returning from Delhi 'who knows my father' ? Screaming obama ne aane se pehle apana bharat daura thodaa chota kiya jisaki vajah se unka agra jane kaa kaarykram radd ho gaya
 After hearing this many people were heartbroken and they started reacting as if Obama refused to join the nephew of his nephew not seeing the Taj
 kuch ye kehete paae gaye ki baraak ‚Äòhossain‚Äô obama agra main hue haalia ‚Äòghar vaapasi‚Äô ke chalate dar gaye hai
 At the same time, some were saying that they were afraid that along with Taj Mahal, Azam Khan should not declare them the property of Waqf Board
 lekin baraak obama ke agra na jane kii jo sabase vaazib vajah bataai gai wo ye thi ki obama dilli se agra ke bich padane vaale toll tex kaa kharch sun sakate main aa gaye the
 Well Obama came to India and said hi as soon as he landed
 yahaan bhi afvaah failaane waalon ne unhen nahin bakhsha
 If they believe, after hello, where is Obama, 'babuji (aloknath') directly from Modi ji? ' Asked and then instead of going to the hotel, 'suryavansham' insisted to go to Hira Thakur's house
 mishael obama ke bare main kaha ja rahaa he ki wo modi se aupchaarik abhivadan ke baad palika bazaar kaa rasta puch rahi thim
 Obama's visit to India is also being attributed to China's increasing interference on international issues
 modi ne obama kii wo chintaa bhi chaay pite-pilaate khatm kar di
 He put a sugarcube in a cup of tea and shook it with a spoon, pointing to Obama that we can make the 'chinese' disappear
 baraak obama kii bharat yatra ke uddeshy bhi talaashe ja rahe hai or nihitarth bhi bataae ja rahe he
 According to the rumor in the rumor market, Obama has come to India at the behest of Michelle
 kyonki wo yahaan aakar ‚Äòsasuraal simer kaa‚Äô dekhnaa chaahati thim
 If people related to the insurance sector are to be believed, they will also take the 'jeevan Saral Policy' on the pretext of this journey
 ek builder kii maane, to obama usase noida main ritairement ke baad rahane ke liye ek flats or iemai kii kisht pataa karne aae hai
 a disciple of Nirmal Baba says that in fact he has come to participate in Babaji's congregation under the cover of the parade
 afvaahon kii had to tab ho gai jab kisi ko yah kehete suna kii obama gurmeet ram rahim ke ems dekhne aaye hai or lautate tak main apana naam baraak hossain obama insaan rakh lenge
 On the go: Agra is the happiest of Obama's visit to India
 ek to taj chamak uthaa shahar sainh ho gaya or duusare obama ke na aane ke chalate dillivaasiyon kii tarah bandishen bhi nahi jhelni padin
 One more thing has come out of this that no cleanliness campaign is needed to clean all the countries, only Obama is invited to visit different cities every month

 ye to aap sabhi jaanate hi hai ki bhai dooj parv bhaiyon ke prati bahanon kii shraddha or vishwaas kaa parv he
 This festival is celebrated every year on the second day of the bright fortnight of Kartik month
 lekin ise manaane kii vajah kya he is bare main bahut hi kam logon ko jaankaree he
 Actually, this festival symbolizing brotherly affection is celebrated two days after Deepawali
 ise yama dwitiya bhi kehete hai
 That is why Yama Dev is worshiped on this festival
 manyata ke anusaar jo yama dev kii upasna karata he, use akaal mrityu kaa bhay nahin rahata he
 Like other festivals of Hindus, this festival is also associated with traditions
 is din bahanen apane bhai ko tilak lagaakar or uphaar dekar uski lambii aayu kii kaamana karti hai
 In return, the brother pledges to protect his sister
 is din bhai kaa apni bahan ke ghar bhojan karnaa vishesh rup se shubh hota he
 This festival in Mithila city is still known as Yamdwatiya
 is din chawlon ko piskar ek lep bhaiyon ke donon haathon main lagaaya jaataa he
 Also, in some places the tradition of applying vermilion in the hands of brother is also seen
 bhai ke haathon main sindur or chaaval kaa lep lagane ke baad us par paan ke paanch pattey, supaari or chaandi kaa sikaa rakhaa jaataa he, us par jal udelte hue bhai kii dderghaayu ke liye mantra bolaa jaataa he
 Brothers give gifts to their sister
 aise hui bhai dooj kii shuruyatbhai dooj ke vishay main manyataek puranic manyata ke anusaar yamuna ne isi din apane bhai yamraj kii lambii aayu ke liye vrath kiya tha, or unhen annakut kaa bhojan khilaayaa tha
 According to the legend, the god Yama appeared to his sister on this day
 yama kii bahan yamuna apni bahan se milane ke liye atyadhik vyakul thi
 Yamuna was very happy to see her brother
 yamuna ne prasann hokar apane bhai kii bahut aavbhagat kii
 Yama pleased and gave him a boon that on this day, if both brothers and sisters take a bath together in the river Yamuna, they will get liberation
 isi kaaran se is in yamuna nadi main bhai-bahan ke saath snaan karne kaa bada mahatv he
 Apart from this, Yama took a promise from Yamuna that on this day every brother should go to his sister's house
 tabhi se bhai dooj manaane kii pratha chali aa rahi he
 The importance of Bhai Dooj strengthens the bond of affection between brother and sister
 bhartiyaparampara ke anusaaravivaah ke baad kanya kaa apane ghar, maayke main kabhi-kabhaar hi aana hota he
 Family members are sometimes able to visit him on behalf of the maiden
 aise main bhai apni bahan ke prati udasin na hon, usase sadaa sneh bana rahen, bahan ke sukh:dukh kaa pataa chalata rahen
 Brothers, do not neglect your sisters, and the two keep their relationship sweet

 Pranab Mukherjee contested the 1980 Lok Sabha elections against the wishes of Indira Gandhi and when he lost, Indira Gandhi reprimanded him for a long time, but even after losing he got a place in the Union Cabinet

 Now the President, Mukherjee has denied rumors that he was included in the cabinet because Indira Gandhi wanted a team of 22 people and 22 was considered astrologically auspicious, secondly Bhagwat Jha Azad joined the cabinet Was refused to happen
 raashtrapati ne apni pustak 'da drametic dicade: da indira gandhi iers' main un dinon ke ghatnakram ko yaad kiya, jab indira gandhi janvari, 1980 main satta main lauti thim
 Rupa Publications has just released this book
 mukherjee ne likhaa he, indira gandhi hameshaa kii tarah 1980 ke chunaav main majbootee or vishwaas ke saath utrin
 i got the job of electing original and loyal Congressmen to contest elections, Indira Gandhi advised me to choose people who can run the government
 
 
 unhen apni chunavi jeet kaa itnaa bharosa tha
 The President wrote, She gave me clear advice not to contest Lok Sabha elections in 1980, but she agreed to my persistence
 main bolpur nirvachan kshetra se chunaav ladaa or 68,629 maton ke antar se haar gaya
 
 
 This decisive vote discouraged me
 unhone pustak main kaha ki unki patni gita pehle hi dilli chali gai thim or jab chunaav nateeja aayaa, tab unhone usee din dilli bulaayaa or kaha ki indira gandhi unase milanaa chaahati hai
 He said, i returned to Delhi on an evening flight and went straight to Willingdon Crescent to meet Indira Gandhi
 yah kahana chizon ko kamkar pesh karnaa nahin hoga ki vah chunaav ladane kii meri jidd se naakhush thim
 He said that Sanjay Gandhi told him that he has been very angry ever since he heard the news of my defeat and when he met him, this was proved
 raashtrapati ne likhaa he, meri kiafiyat talab kii gai
 It was about nine o'clock in the night and she was sitting at one end of a large dining table in the dining room
 unhen sardi-zukam ho gaya tha or vah garm pani main apana pair daali hui thim
 Pranab Mukherjee recounting his meeting with Indira Gandhi that evening said in the book, "I was standing at the other end of the dining table table and i got a sharp rebuke and it seems that this process went on for a long time
" unki ichha ke viruddh bolpur se chunaav ladane ke galat nirnay lene ko lekar mujhe daant padi or mujhase kaha gaya ki avivekpurna faislon se parishram se kiye gaye anya mere kaary mahatvaheen ho gaye
 Mukherjee has written that he just stood there and when Indira Gandhi calmed down, he sent her home with a basket of fruits
 pustak main kaha gaya he ki media main prastaavit mantrimandal ko lekar atakalein tej thim or kisi bhi media ne mantrimandal ke liye mukherjee ke naam kaa zikr nahin kiya, kyonki sabhi yah maan chuke the ki haar kii vajah se vah sarkaar se baahar rahenge
 According to the book, Sanjay Gandhi called Mukherjee and told him that he was saddened to learn that he was upset at the prospect of not being included in the government
 mukherjee ne likhaa he, maine unase kaha ki unhen galat soochna di gai he, kyonki spasht taur par maine apni haar ke baad us maamle par utana maathapai kiya hi nahin or yah ki mujhe maaloom tha ki sarkaar main mujhe shaamil karne kii pahal bilkul asahaj karne vaali baat hogi
 The President has written, on this Sanjay Gandhi told me, it has already been decided to include you in the government by giving you the status of Cabinet Minister as Commerce Minister
 lekin unhen yah nahin maaloom tha ki pehali khep main shapath lene waalon main main shaamil hounga main yaa duusari khep main
 He asked me to talk to Indira Gandhi about this
 maine unase kaha ki main nahin samajhataa ki is maamle par unase baat karnaa upyukt hoga
 The book said that on the morning of January 14, the day of the swearing in of the cabinet, the market of speculation in newspapers was hot
 kareeb saadhe nau baje mukherjee ko indira gandhi ke sahyogi aarake dhawan ne phone kiya or unase 11 baje raashtrapati bhawan main upasthit rahane ko kaha
 Mukherjee was told not to wait for any message or call from the Cabinet Secretariat
 mukherjee ne likhaa he, main raashtrapati bhawan gaya
 When i reached Ashoka Hall, there was no seat for me in the queue of ministers who took the oath
 maine indira gandhi ko dekha jinhone turant bhaanp liya ki kuch gadabad he
 He has written that Dhawan came to him and asked him to wait
 vah cabinet sachiv ke paas gaye or raashtrapati ke sachiv ke saath charchaa karne par pataa chalaa ki niyukt kiye jane vaale mantriyon ke naamon kii sifarish vaale patr main unka naam haath se likhaa gaya tha, na ki tip kiya gaya tha
 He has written, the President's Secretariat could not understand this
 aise main swabhaavik rup se mere liye seat chihnit nahin kii gai
 Indira Gandhi immediately wrote another letter by hand and got it delivered to the President's Secretary
 mukherjee ne pustak main kaha he, mujhe aar venkataraman or pivi narsimha raav ke bich main baithne ko kaha gaya
 The swearing-in papers were handed over to me, but since i was not named in the list of ministers, i did not know my ministry
 maine pivi narsimha raav or aar venkataraman se poocha, lekin unhone unhone mujhase kaha ki unhen apane apane mantralay ke alaava or kuch maaloom nahin
 He has written that Indira Gandhi was sworn in first and then Kamalapati Tripathi
 uske baad angreji kii varnmaala ke hisaab se baaki ko shapath dilaai gai
 a Chandigarh newspaper speculated that Mukherjee's name has been included in the last minute, as Indira Gandhi wanted a team of 22 people who were deemed auspicious from astrology and Azad refused to take the oath, so Mukherjee Has been included
 mukherjee ne likhaa he, kalpana kii udaan se ye atakalein chal rahi thim or mantrimandal main mujhe shaamil kiye jane se sambandhit ghatnakram is tarah tha, jaisaa maine byoraa diya

 lok sabha main paarit hone ke baad vidheyak ko rajya sabha main pesh kiya jayega
 The government does not have a majority in the Rajya Sabha, so the government is trying to get the support of the opposition on the bill
 vitt mantri arun jetali ne kaha he ki sarkaar is aitihaasik vidheyak ko sahmati ke saath sadan main paarit karana chaahati he
 The Congress has not agreed to support the GST Bill amid attempts by the Opposition to agree on GST

 The government today brought happiness to his face by filling his bag with the budget
 sabase zyada desh kii janata ko tex ke morch par sarkaar se riyaayat kii ummid thi, or sarkaar ne bhi unhen noummid nahin kii
 While presenting the interim budget in the Lok Sabha, Union Minister Piyush Goyal has raised the income tax exemption limit
 loksabhaa chunaav se pehle ye aam aadmi ko sarkaar kii taraf se bada tohfa he
 The government has increased the income tax exemption limit from Rs 2
5 lakh to Rs 5 lakh directly
 ek tarah se modi sarkaar antarim bajet main iskar chhot kii seemaa badhaakar middle class ko khush kar diya he
 It is worth noting that earlier the income tax exemption in income tax was up to two and a half lakh rupees, which has now been extended
 is elaan se pehle tex slab main 2
 There was no tax on annual earnings up to Rs 5 lakh
 jabaki 2
 An income of Rs 5 to 5 lakh was taxed at the rate of 5 percent, which has now been abolished

 Whereas, earning from 5 lakh to 10 lakh rupees will be subject to 20 per cent income tax
 jabaki 10 lakh se adhik aamadani waalon ko 30 fisadi kar vasula jayega
 That is, the government has abolished the tax slab of only 5 percent

 Those who are passionate about Sanskrit are enemies of Sanskrit
 maujuuda vivaad ko jaanboojh kar sanskrit virodh ke daayre main fansaae rakhana chaahate hai
 For example, Sanskrit has suffered due to Macaulay and Marxists
 ho saktaa he hua bhi ho, lekin is samasya ke kaarnon ko sanskrit ke bheetar bhi jhaank kar dekhnaa chahie or un logon kii manshaa main bhi jo sanskrit ke himachati hai
 There should be no doubt in this and there is no need to repeat every time what is Sanskrit or what is in Sanskrit
 sanskrit main sambhaavnaaen na hotin, to aaj sanskrit kaa naamo nishaan mit gaya hota
 It was never the language of the common man, but you cannot ignore its creations and enter a large world of knowledge
 yahi vishistataa farsi ko bhi hasil he
 The question is what should be done for Sanskrit and if this government wants to do it, then who is stopping it? The government or Sanskrit supporters want to keep themselves from accountability under the pretext of bashing the Macaulists
 is tabake ko agar janamat kii phikr he to us madhyamvarg yaa matadaatavarg ke bich jaakar sahmati banani chahie jisane badi sankhya main sarkaar kaa samarthan kiya he
 If middle class India agrees then why hesitate? They should have a clear action plan that a lot of work will have to be done to save Sanskrit and this government can do it
 sarkaar ke paas bahumat he or sansaadhan bhi
 This is the right time to do what can be done institutionally for Sanskrit
 meraa apana mat he ki sanskrit ke liye har haal main kuch na kuch nahin, balki bahut kuch kiya janaa chahie
 Sanskrit is still providing employment
 bhale hi aap use blue collar yaa white collar job na kahen
 In the realm of religion, business also thrives and there is a huge source of employment from two to four mantras of Sanskrit
 aap ise philhal karmkand se lekar puja-paath, yoga, dhyaan-aradhana tamaam sambodhan se nawaz sakate hai
 If there was no possibility of employment in temples, there would not have been different types of temples being built in the street and no Baba or new God would be launched every day
 in sab sambhaavnaaon kaa dwaar sanskrit bhi he
 One can dismiss it as superstition, but the reality is there
 sawaal yah poocha janaa chahie ki sanskrit ke liye kya kiya jayega? kya shapath le lene se yaa naare laga dene se sanskrit kaa bhala ho jayega
 Sanskrit cannot become a lingua franca
 koi bana de to swaagat karnaa chahie, lekin naare lagane ke alaava iske liye koi thos prayaas nahin dikhataa he
 Therefore, most of the criticisms are airborne
 hamaare desh main sanskrit kaa ek bhi kendriya vishvavidhyalay nahin he
 So will the central government take the existing Sanskrit universities under its control from the states and develop them
 iske liye sau karod nahin, balki kuch hazaar karod rupee kii raashi chahie
 The government should do this work for Sanskrit by placing stones on the heart
 sanskrit vishvavidhyalay ke ek register ne kaha ki sanskrit ke santhaan rajya ke samarthan se hi chal sakate hai, laabh-haani ke siddhant par nahin
 There are around 750 Sanskrit colleges in India
 inamen se 510 college sirf upi main hai, jo banaras sthit sampoornanad sanskrit vishvavidhyalay se sambandhit hai
 There are three deemed universities
 13 rajyon main 14 sanskrit vishvavidhyalay hai
 There is also a Sanskrit University in Assam
 pichley dedh dashakon ke dauraan sanskrit ke aath vishvavidhyalay bane hai hai
 All these have been maintained during BJP governments
 lekin inke yahaan bhi sthiti koi behatar nahin he
 In most places there is no faculty according to the prescribed number, then somewhere salary is not paid properly
 collejon kii sthiti main giravat aati ja rahi he
 To handle all these situations, resources are needed, not sentimentality
 isiilie kaha ki sanskrit ke shubhachintakon ko apane sawaal bekaar ho chuke marxvaadiyon se nahin sarkaar se karnaa chahie
 You cannot do Sanskrit well by making the subject of examination
 sanskrit kaa bhala tabhi hoga jab sanskrit ke santhaan bachenge
 In many states, the BJP government has been running thrice
 yahaan bhi sanskrit ke vishvavidhyalay bane hai
 At least the RSS or BJP should present these universities as an example of what they have done concretely and what has been achieved
 sirf vishvavidhyalay khol dena kaaphi nahin he, balki yah bataaya janaa chahie ki vahaan shikshakon kii niyuktiyaan paryaapt he yaa nahin
 How much work is going on to expand the language
 un vishvavidhyalayon yaa collejon kaa str kitna sudhara he
 This will at least put locks in the mouths of the opposing political parties
 sanskrit ko lekar bahes main kudane waalon ko yah bhi sochna chahie ki isaki baat sangh parivaar hi kyon karata he? bijepi hi kyon karti he? is bhashaa ne duusare dalon kaa kya bigaada he? lekin sangh parivaar ko bataanaa chahie usne sanskrit ko kya se kya bana diya he
 Somewhere to be accounted
 sanskrit koun pard rahaa he
 Sanskrit cannot be expanded by saving as a subject in schools
 ham sab jaanate hai ki number laakar phir bhul jaaenge
 Sanskrit is a classic language
 isaki padhai ko itnaa aakarshak banaaya hi janaa chahie jisase lage ki aap panditai ke liye nahin, balki bhartiya gyaan parampara main siddh hone ke liye pard rahe hai
 a teacher told that about one and a half lakh students of UP are involved in Sampurnanand University
 inamen se zyaadaatar garib tabake ke bachche hai
 Those who do not know the numbers and who cannot read expensive studies
 yahi kaaran he ki sanskrit ke vidhyaarthiyon main pichhadi jati ke bachche zyada hai
 The section that is getting emotional should first enroll their children in Sanskrit
 iske alaava ek chunauti sanskrit ko aadhunik banane kii he
 In personal conversation, Sanskrit scholars also believe that syllabus has to be modernized
 iskaa matlab yah nahin ki puraani rachanaaon ko darkinar kar diya jaae, lekin is maamle main bahut kuch kiya janaa baaki he
 The government has not yet presented a concrete effort to save Sanskrit
 yahaan course main laga dena yaa vahaan se hataa dena yah sab prakriyaatmak bahes ke mudde hai
 The sentiment about Sanskrit is only to prove frivolity to those who question it
 agar sahi main saansthanik prayaas kii shuruyaat ho jaae or tay ho jaae ki koi bhi sarkaar rahe sanskrit sahit do teen anya bhashaaon ke vikaas ke liye kendriya fund se paanch hazaar karod rupee kii niyamit raashi di jaaegi taaki ye bachi rahen to bhashaa batch jaaegi
 State governments cannot handle hundreds of colleges
 shiksha ke nijeekaran ke is daur main centre sarkaar se ummid kam hi rakhiye ki wo sanskrit ke liye buniyadi rup se kuch karegi
 Sanskrit has to be taken out of the language of the ashrams and become a professional medium of epistemology
 itani behatar bhashaa ko ham yun hi haath se nahin jane de sakate

 rajyasabha main likhit jaankaree dete hue kendriya grih rajyamantri hansraj ahir ne kaha he ki pichley saal 342 aatanki ghatnaayen hui, jisamen 213 aatankwaadiyon ko surakshabalon ne alag alag oparation main dher kiya
 At the same time, soldiers of 80 security forces were martyred while making supreme sacrifice
 2017 main hi 40 nagarikon ne bhi aatanki hamalon main apni jaan gavaayin
 According to the data given by the Ministry of Home Affairs, in the last 3 years, the highest number of terrorist incidents occurred in 2017, in which 342 terrorists attacked the security forces
 vahiin 2016 main 322 baar aatankwaadiyon ne suraksha balon par hamalaa kiya he, 2015 main sirf 208 baar aatankwaadiyon ne alag-alag jagahon par suraksha balon ko nishaanaa banaaya
 Meanwhile, security forces killed 213 militants in Kashmir Valley in 2017 alone
 jabaki 2016 main sirf 150 aatankwaadiyon ko suraksha balon ne maar giraaya tha
 Security forces have killed most of the terrorists in 2017 as compared to previous years
 pichley saal kashmir ghati main suraksha balon neoparation ol outkashmir ke sabhi jilon main chalaa rakhaa tha, jo is saal bhi jari he
 The success of Operation All Out was that neither militants were able to infiltrate from across the border into the Kashmir Valley
 vahiin jo aatanki ghuspaith kar kashmir ghati main pahunch rahe the, unako vahiin par dher kiya ja rahaa tha
 This is the reason that in the last 3 years in 2017, the maximum strength of 213 terrorists was piled under Operation All Out
 haalaan ki iske baavjood pakistan kii khufia agency iesai lagaataar bharat main aatankiyon kii ghuspaith karaane ke liye seemaa paar se aatankwaadiyon ko lonching pad par lekar pahunch rahi he
 Pakistan is bringing these terrorists to the border by trending with modern weapons as well as GPS systems
 ajtak ko mili khufia jaankaree ke mutabik is vakt seemapar pakistan ke lonching pad par 386 aatankwaadi maujuud hai, jinako kii alag-alag lonching pad par pakistan kii khufia agency iesai or paak army ne baitha rakhaa he
 Sources reveal that these terrorists have been trended by the Special Operations Team of the Pakistan Army, which is capable of carrying out a major crime against India
 is vajah se bhartiya suraksha agenciyaan is vakt sarhad par itnaa alert he ki yah aatanki kisi bhi tareeke se is ilaake main ghus nahin sakate yani ki international border or line of control donon jagahon par suraksha balon kii chaukasee aisi he ki koi parinda par bhi nahin maar saktaa
 bjp's prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi blamed the central government for making wrong policies and attacked the Congress strongly
 modi ne kaha ki isse desh kii arthvyavastha bahut adhik prabhavit hui he
 Addressing a rally at Khetri in Jhunjhunu district, Narendra Modi said that the factories are closing due to policy failure
 unhone kaha, 'dilli kii sarkaar rupee kii giravat ko rokane main sakasham nahin he
 The copper industry employing more than 10,000 people has fallen into disarray
 ' gauratlab he ki khetadi main hindustan copper limited kii factory he
 Narendra Modi said, 'atal Bihari Vajpayee's government conducted nuclear test
 jab hamane pareekshan kiya, duniya ne aashcharya jataayaa or pratibandh lagu kiya
 Despite all this, Atalji did not let the value of the rupee fall
 arthvyavastha majboot bani rahi, lekin dekhie aaj hamaare arthshaastri pradhanmantri ke rahete kya ho rahaa he
 The rupee is in the ICU today
 'modi ne poocha ki congress kis aadhaar par vot maang rahi he
 He said, 'has the party done anything good for the people of Rajasthan
 supreme court or hoicourt, donon kah chuke hai ki yadi aapako sarkaar chalaanaa nahin aata, to aap pad chhod den
 He said that you do not know how to rule, you do not know how to work, yet the Congress is seeking votes
 'modi ne kaha ki yahaan tak ki 'shahjade' ko bhi ashok gahalot ke netritv vaali sarkaar main bharosa nahin he
 He said, 'if there were riots in Bharatpur, they roamed the town without giving any notice to the government
 'modi ne jor diya ki vikaas ke liye krishi or infrastracchar par jor dena hoga
 The service sector comes at number three
 modi rath ko rokane ke liye tamaam vipakshi dal ek manch par to jute rahe hai, lekin vipaksh kaa netaa koun ho iskaa jawaab kisi ke paas nahin he
 Even the Samajwadi Party national president Akhilesh Yadav changed the lyrics as soon as he came from Kolkata to Lucknow
 bahujan samaaj party ke saath gathbandhan ke baad akhilesh ne kaha tha ki main chahta hum ki desh kaa aglaa pradhanmantri uttar pradesh se ho
 Now at Mamta Banerjee's mega rally in Kolkata, Akhilesh said that the Prime Minister will be the one whom the public will elect
 mega raily ko sambodhit karte hue akhilesh yadav ne kaha ki modi sarkaar se aapke or hamaare adhikaron ko khatra he
 The matter which will run from Bengal will be seen in the country
 abhi bhi nayaa saal aayaa he, taarikh badali to ham bahut khush hai
 Think how happy you and i will be if a new Prime Minister comes to the country
 unhone kaha ki bijepi ke log kehete hai ki hamaare paas dulhe bahut zyada hai, lekin ham kehete hai ki jise janata chunegi vah pradhanmantri banegaa
 The country will get a new Prime Minister
 hamane kiya janata se gathbandhanbijepi se sawaal poochhate hue akhilesh yadav ne kaha ki pradhanmantri pad ke liye aapke paas doosraa naam koun sa he
 The first name has disappointed the country
 unhone kaha ki abhi yah to kam dalon kaa gathbandhan he
 We have learned from you
 jaise aapane gathbandhan karke sarkaar banaai, vaise hi hamane sabkon ek manch par laane kaa kaam kiya
 You have 40 alliances
 jaise-jaise chunaav aa rahaa he aap or logon ke saath gathbandhan kar rahe ho
 From the CBI, from the ED, but we all have formed an alliance with the public
 gathbandhan se bijepi ke netaa dar gaye hanspa adhyaksh akhilesh yadav ne kaha ki hamaare gathbandhan ke baad bijepi ke netaa baithak ke baad baithak kar rahe hai
 BJP people are wondering how to finally win a seat in Uttar Pradesh
 hamaari or aapaki jimmedaari he ki bengal, bihar, jharkhand main bhi bijepi kaa khaataa na khule
 He said that BJP has done poison in society
 bijepi ke log kaam ke naam par vot nahin maangate, vah na jane kya sajeesh or shadyantr karenge
 BJP asked, who is the leader of the coalition, whenever the opposition coalition is ready against the government, the issue of the leader remains in shadow
 pehle bhi gathbandhan bana or pehle bhi yahi masalaa uthaa, lekin chunaav ke pehle shaayad hi kabhi aisa hua ki puraa vipaksh kisi ko netaa maanakar chunaav main utre
 Maybe this time it is the same, but what is the guarantee that the question of the Prime Minister's candidate does not arise after the election
 bijepi netaa rajeev pratap rudi ne poocha ki aakhir vipaksh kaa netaa koun he

 But the siege done by the local administration is telling a different story
 adhikariyon ke anusaar, singhl ko safataur par bataa diya gaya he ki yaa to vah dilli chale jaaen yaa phir vah is awaas se baahar nahin nikal paaenge
 It is noteworthy that VHP has announced 84 Kosi Parikrama from 25 August to 13 September, but the state government has banned the visit

 Aruna did this feat, which no Indian could do till date

 us dauraan saal 1913 tak farvari ke aakhri ravivaar ko yah de manaaya gaya
 This day was celebrated in America for the first time on February 1909-28
 socialist party of america ne neuyork main 1908 main garment workars kii hadtaal ko sammaan dene ke liye is din kaa chayan kiya taaki is din mahilaayein kaam ke kam ghante or behatar vetanman ke liye apana virodh or maang darj karvaa saken

 What is the color? Purple color has special significance on this day, because Purple is used for women

 It is still vigorously celebrated for the political and social upliftment of women with the political and human rights theme selected by the United Nations
 kuch log bangnee rang ke riban pahanakar is din kaa jashn manaate hai
 Yogendra Yadav, once a part of the Aam Aadmi Party and a partner of Arvind Kejriwal, has sought his resignation as the Chief Minister of Delhi
 aap se alag hokar swaraj india banane vaale yogendra ne dilli chhodkar goa or punjab main chunaav prachaar kar rahe aap sarkaar ke mantri or vidhayakon par bhi sawaal uthaae hai
 Yogendra Yadav did these 9 strikes on AAP aap punjab main kahati he ki vah rajya ko nashamukt banaaegi, to dilli main bhi jaraa dekhen ki nasha mukti kaise kii thi
 After coming to power, he opened 399 new contracts, reduced dry-days
 is dauraan yahaan videshi sharaab kaa seven 54% bad gaya
 So will they make Punjab free from such intoxication
 2
 Scholarship for the women in Delhi was reduced
 daliton ke utthan se judi yojanaayen lagu hi nahin kar rahe hai
 3
 dilli main vaade puure karte, to daawa karne kaa adhikaar miltaa he
 He promised to open 500 new schools
 ham yah nahin kehete ki pehle saal hi 100 skool bana do, lekin pehle saal main mahaj 4 skool bane
 He promised 20 colleges, but instead of increasing the number 1 college has decreased
 4
 AAP promised that students would be given loans and 97 students were given loans
 lekin haqiqat yah he ki dilli sarkaar ne sirf 3 chaatro ko lone diya
 If we claim now, then there will be an inquiry
 5
 The Aam Aadmi Party has been diagnosed with Modi ji

 7
 dilli hycourt ke jajment ke baad aam aadmi party sarkaar ne maan liya he ki unke paas dilli main karne ko kuch nahin he
 Even if the municipal corporations lose, the government has to run for 3 years
 8
 i appeal that Arvind Kejriwal should openly say that he is a contender for the post of Chief Minister of Punjab
 dilli se istifa den or vaayada karen ki jeeta yaa haara to punjab kii seva karuunga
 9

 Book Name: Azad Childhood Writer: Kailash Satyarthi Prakashkar: Prabhat Prakashan: 17 crore children worldwide are so unfortunate that their childhood is slipping into child labor mill
 kareeb chah karod bachche kabhi bhi skool kaa munh tak nahin dekh pate or kareeb 12 karod bachche kii takadir itani acchhee nahin hoti ki wo apni padhai shuruuaati saalon main jari rakhkar puri kar saken
 About eight and a half million children are held in chains of slavery, prostitution, beggars and dangerous industries
 itani taadaad main bacchon kii ye fouj apni kismat se lard rahi he, or ye sikke kaa ek pahalu he
 While on the other side of the same coin, a picture appears, which gives encouragement to the children fighting for their rights
 bacchon par hone vaale julmon, sitam ko sarkaar, samaaj yaa phir corporate jagat ab nazarandaaj nahin kar sakate
 All these things have been highlighted in the book 'azad Bachchan Ki Oar' by Kailash Satyarthi, who won the Nobel Peace Prize and spent his whole life fighting for the rights of children
 prabhaat prakaashan kii ore se prakashit is pustak main kailash satyaarthee ne apane 35 saal ke sangharsh ke un hisson kaa ullekh kiya he, jo unke is safar main padaav kii shakl main saamne aae
 The mention of the campaign against bonded labor and child slavery started in the 1980s is really worth considering because the mention of these parts also makes it clear that what the author really needs to understand the sociology of humanity and the experience of handling childhood
 What circumstances faced and continued his journey overcoming those situations
 is pustak main lekhak ne apane sangharsh ke kisson kii gavaahi un lekhon ke jariye di he jo kalantar main desh ke alag alag rashtriya samachar patron main na sirf chape balki kailash satyaarthee ko bachapan bachaane vaale yoddha ke rup main sthapit karte rahe
 In the opening pages of the same book, under various headlines, Kailash Satyarthi also shared his experience which he felt during his long battle
 unka maananaa he ki saamaajik chetana ko jagaane or mulk ke bachapan ko sanvaarane or unhen unka haq dilaane ke saath-saath desh kii mukhya dhara kaa hissaa banane ke liye jaruri he ki desh main rajnatik ichha shakti ho
 Unfortunately, all the political parties operating in the country seem to be waging a power struggle, but children and their lost childhood are not their priority
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki 1976 main bane bandhua mazdooree unmoolan mazdooree ke kanoon or 1986 main bane bal mazdooree unmoolan kanoon ke banane ke baavjood ajtak kisi bhi maalik or aaropee ko ek din ke liye bhi jail kii salaakhon ke peeche nahin rahanaa padaa
 The picture with which Kailash Satyarthi has come out through this book is not only startling but also intimidating
 kitaab kaa saar bhi yahi kahata he ki agar apane kal ko sanvarna chaahate hai to hamen aaj hi apane bachapan kii parvarish or unki samuchit shiksha kaa intjaam kar dena chahie
 Not only this, everything can be fine for the political children of the country, if they are involved in the campaign for the sake of children and for saving childhood
 isse mulk bhi khushhaal hoga
 Perhaps these countries again started to be called gold birds

 is haar se rashtrarpati chunaav main haar ke baad pradhanmantri ke rup main satta main vaapasi kii rajpakshe kii koshishon ko gaharaa jhatka laga he or lambey samay ke liye satta se unki duuri ban gai he
 Rajapaksa was seen as a patron of China's interests in Sri Lanka and his closeness with China as well as Pakistan could not in any sense be beneficial to India
 ab kaa shashan raashtrapati maitripala sirisena or unke samarthan praapt ranil vikramsinghe ke haathon main he jo ki bharat ke liye pakshakar hi mana jayega
 PM Modi congratulated Wickramasinghe: Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulated his Sri Lankan counterpart Ranil Wickremesinghe for victory in his country's parliamentary elections and hoped that under his leadership, the relationship between the two countries will be strengthened
 pradhanmantri modi ne twit kiya, ‚Äòshri ranil vikramsinghe se baat kii or unhen or unke gathbandhan ko chunaavon menshandaar pradarshan ke liye badhai di
 He said, "I am confident that under the leadership of Wickremesinghe there will be further deepening of bilateral relations between India and Sri Lanka
" ‚Äô pradhanmantri modi ne shantipurna chunaav sampann hone ke liye srilanka kii janata ko bhi hardik badhai di
 Better relations with the neighborhood is important that in Prime Minister Modi's foreign policy, improving relations with neighboring countries is a priority
 pradhanmantri modi ne isi saal srilanka kii yatra kii thi
 After assuming the presidency of Sri Lanka in January this year, Maithripala Sirisena had also chosen India for her first foreign trip and committed to walk together for common progress
 chunaav nattejey ko raashtrapati maitripal sirisena kii jeet ke rup main dekha ja rahaa he
 He vowed that Rajapaksa would not be allowed to become Prime Minister even after UPFA got majority
 srilanka main sudhaaron ko lagu karne uddeshy se majboot bahumat ke liye sirisena ne samay se purv chunaav karaae
 China's challenge increased This election in Sri Lanka is also important for India and other countries of the world
 kaaran iske nattejey srilanka kii raajnneetik disha to tay karenge hi saath hi hind mahaasaagar kshetra main bhugolic-raajnneetik prabhaav bhi daalenge
 The Indian Ocean region has become a new global center in terms of trade and energy
 asia main prabhutv jamaane kii koshishon main lage china ke liye srilanka kaaphi myne rakhata he lekin rajpakshe gut ke satta se baahar hone ke baad china ke liye srilanka main ranneetik evam vyapaarik sugamawa kam ho jaaegi
 Which can benefit India
 rajpakshe kaa rukh china samarthak tharajpakshe ke shashan main china ko srilanka main kai badi pariyojnaayen haath lagi jo ki ranneetik or aarthik rup se vahaan bharat kii tulana main china ko agrim pankti main rakhata tha
 Had Rajapaksa returned to power, Sri Lanka could have received a green signal from several projects in Sri Lanka, including the Colombo City project, which are still pending
 china kii funding vaale bade projects yaa to paryaavaran sambandhi muddon yaa duusari manzooriyaan na milane ke kaaran fanse hue hai
 India had strongly objected to Rajapaksa last year when Chinese submarines reached Colombo Port twice
 is baat ko lekar bharat ke pradhanmantri ke str se aapatti jataai gai thi
 Strategically, India also becomes important for Sri Lanka India in the perspective of profit because China has focused its attention on the Indian Ocean after capturing its land in the South China Sea and making outposts
 yahaan isaki gatividhiyaan vartmaan shakti santulan ko chunauti de rahi hai
 China has built Hambantota port in Sri Lanka
 china pryojit samudri silk root ke liye srilanka pramukh jagah he
 It is a trade effort under which China intends to build several maritime access centers in the Indian Ocean region through agreements for refueling, cargo loading, ship crew stay and ship maintenance
 lekin vikramsinghe kii satta main vaapasi kaa bharat ke liye matlab hoga ki ab china kaa parmaanu sabamarine srilanka ke tat par nahin ruuk sakegaa
 Political reconciliation will take place Due to the Tejnai government's good relations with the Tamil parties of the northern regions, political reconciliation in Sri Lanka will be accelerated
 saath hi vikramsinghe kii party hameshaa bharat ke saath khaskar dakshini bharat ke paanch rajyon ke saath majboot or pragadh vyapaarik sambandhon ke himachati rahe hai or satta main unki vaapasi se is prakriya ko phir teji milegi
 At the same time, they will also be focused on renewing the negotiations on Comprehensive Economic Partnership agreement-cepa with India
 raashtrapati sirsena kaa samarthan aayega kamranil vikramsinghe kii isi saal janvari main pradhanmantri pad par vaapasi hui thi
 After Rajapaksa lost in the hands of Sirisena in the presidential elections, Sirisena made Wickramasinghe the Prime Minister
 rajpakshe ne tab apni haar ke liye bhartiya khufia agency ro ko jimmedaar tehra diya tha
 Wickremesinghe's statement also came up in controversies
 In March this year, a statement from Wickremesinghe had come into controversy just before Prime Minister Modi's visit to Sri Lanka
 jab vikramsinghe ne kaha ki bhartiya machuaare yadi hamaare jalakshetra seemaa paar karte hai or un par golibari kii jaati he to yah maanavadhikaron kaa ulanghan nahin he
 Indian fishermen enter our waters only when the power is used on them, which is also right
 bharat ne badhaayaa sahyog kaa haathhaalanki, iske baad pradhanmantri modi kii yatra ke dauraan machuaaron ke maamalon ke sthaayee samaadhaan ke liye tantra banane par sahmati bani or srilanka main pakade gaye bhartiya machuaaron ke maamalon par maanviya drushtikon se faisle liye gaye
 This step indicates a move towards mutual understanding and amicable relations between India and the Sri Lankan leadership
 pradhanmantri modi ne apni yatra ke dauranjafna kaa bhi daura kiyaor vahaan bharat ke sahyog se chalaai ja rahi maanviya pariyojnaon ko madad jari rakhane kii patibaddhta jataai
 An Indian Prime Minister reached Sri Lanka after a gap of 28 years
 isse pehle rajeev gandhi ne 1987 main is desh kii yatra kii thi
 Indicating a new beginning Vikramasinghe issued a statement saying that i invite all of you to join hands
 chaliye saath milakar sabhy samaaj kaa nirmaan karte hai, sahmati vaali sarkaar banaate hai or nayaa desh banaate hai
 The 65-year-old leader of the United National Party (UNP), Wickramasinghe, is going to become the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka for the fourth time
 isse pehle 1993 se 1994 or 2002 se 2004 tak or phir is saal janvari se abtak ve pradhanmantri pradhanmantri pad sambhaal chuke hai
 It is better for India to leave Rajapaksa's power in Sri Lanka
 bharat ke liye yah raahat kii batahe ki donon hi sheersh vyaktitv, maitripal sirisena or ranil vikramsinghe bharat ke prati kisi tarah kaa purvaagrah nahin rakhte
 Wickramasinghe is considered a friend of India and has been a strong advocate of deepening relations with India
 sirisena ne bhi chunaav prachaar ke dauraan khulkar kaha tha ki vebharat ke saath achche sambandhviksit karenge
 However he also remarked that his foreign policy would neither be hostile to India nor dependent on it
