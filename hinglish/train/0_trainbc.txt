i salute this great son of India on his birth anniversary
 isi ke saath rahul kaa ek or twit he ki yah bhi vidambnaa he ki sardaar patel kii pratimaa kaa anaavaran ho rahaa he, lekin unhone jin sansthaanon ko banaaya ve sabhi dhahaae ja rahe hai
 Systematic fragmentation of India's institutions is nothing short of treason
 ekta kii pratimaa to ban gai, lekin aaj vaaki sardaar kii zarurat he
 When our politics goes into the debate of being a Hindu or not, being a real Hindu or being a fake Hindu, then it is time to search for the Sardar who has gone missing
 jo lohe kii tarah sampradayikta ke khilaaf the
 In 1941, when riots broke out in Ahmedabad, Sardar Patel said that what made you suddenly think that you started biting each other
 mujhe dukh is baat kaa he ki hamaari aabru chali gayi
 The name of the city of Ahmedabad was blurred
 kaise mitaayaa jaae ise
 The only way to erase it is to try to ensure that such an environment does not arise in this city again
 2002 main ahambadabad par phir se kalank laga tha
 Shouldn't everyone atone for the 84 and 2002 riots to this day? jab gandhi kii hatya hui tab grahamantri patel hi the
 He then banned the RSS
 balki apane mantralay ke adheen soochnaaon kaa hawala dete hue saaf-saaf kaha ki hatya ke baad sangh ke logon ne mithai banti thi
 On 11 September 1948, he wrote a letter to Patel's RSS sarsanghchalak MS Golwalkar that it is one thing to organize and help Hindus, but to take revenge on the helpless and innocent men, women and children for their suffering is another matter
 iske alaava ye bhi tha ki unke congress virodh ne, wo bhi is kathorta se ki na vyaktitv kaa khyaal, na sabhyataa kaa, na shishtataa kaa, janata main ek prakaar kii bechaini paidaa kar di
 All his speeches were full of communal poison
 hinduon main josh paidaa karnaa va unki raksha ke prabandh karne ke liye aavashwayak na tha ki zehar faile
 The result of this poison was in the end that the country had to bear the sacrifice of Gandhiji's priceless life
 sarkaar va janata kii ratti bhar sahanubhuti aresas ke saath na rahi, balki unke khilaaf ho gai
 The protest was further intensified by the joy expressed by the RSS people on Gandhiji's death and distributed sweets
 in halaat main sarkaar ko aresas ke khilaaf kadam uthaane ke alaava koi or rasta nahin bachaa tha
 People of the village around Sardar Sarovar Dam have raised questions about this statue
 72 gaanv ke logon ne kaha ki 31 aktubar ko pratimaa ke anaavaran ke virodh main upwas rakhenge
 The stove will remain closed
 22 gaanvon ke pradhanon ne pradhanmantri ko patr likhaa he ki yahaan ke jangalon, nadiyon, jalprapaaton, kheton ne sadiyon se hamaara khyaal rakhaa he
 We have been living around them, but now everything is being destroyed
 kya aapako nahin lagata ki yah kisi kii maut par jashn ke samaan he
 We think so only
 ham gaanv vaale bahut dukh ke saath kahana chaahate hai ki ham 31 aktubar ko aapkaa swaagat nahin karenge
 If you come like an uninvited guest, we will not welcome you
 agar sardaar patel ne dekha hota ki kaise prakritik sansadhano ko nasht kiya ja rahaa he, hamaare saath anyaay ho rahaa he to ve ro dete
 While we are raising our voice, your police is taking action
 aap hamaari takalifon ko sunne ke liye taiyaar kyon nahin hai
 But the Prime Minister has said that due to this statue, the tribal people around will get employment
 pradhanmantri ne yah bhi kaha ki yahaan ek aisi ekta nursery bane ki yahaan aane vaala tourist apane ghar ekta kaa paudha le jaae or boetippaniyan Now the examination is yours, you, the public
 tourist spot ban gaya he
 So this spot is not free
 aapako bhi ye na lage ki aap sardaar kaa darshan muft main kar rahe hai isliye online tikat kii vyavastha he
 There are two types of tickets
 3 saal ke bacchon ko tikat nahin lagegaa
 It will cost Rs 350 to see Observation Deck view, Valley of Flower, Memorial, Museum & Audio Visual Gallery, SOU site, Sardar Sarovar Dam
 agar aap Observation Deck view, nahin janaa chahenge to uske liye alag se package he
 Adult people will get 60 rupees tickets and children 60 rupees
 bas kaa charge he 30 rupaya
 In the case of tickets too, Sardar's statue has become expensive with many palaces, forts and buildings in India
 mahangi kahana thik nahin hoga, kahana chahie ki tikat ke daam bhi sabase oonche hai
 While the ticket for the Red Fort of Delhi is 35 rupees, the Taj Mahal is 50 rupees
 tajmahal dekhne ke liye har saal 70 se 80 lakh paryatak aate hai, jinamein se 8 lakh videshi paryatak hote hai videshi paryatakon ke liye 1100 rupye kaa tikat he
 The Taj Mahal earns 20 crores
 is samay jab sibiai ke do-do afasar ek duusare par mukadmaa karne ke kaaran daftar se baahar kar die gaye hai, tisare afasar par bhi aarope lag rahe hai, reserve bank of india apni swaittata ke liye sangharsh kar rahaa he, chunaav ayog par bhi sawaal uth ja rahe hai
 The Prime Minister is remembering the steel frame made by Patel
 jo sardaar sabake liye lade, us sardaar ke liye sab lard rahe hai
 Therefore the Sardar was the Sardar, there cannot be a Sardar fighting over him
 aap khud bhi pradhanmantri ke bhaashan sune
 He very easily integrated Sardar's contributions to his government's plans in his speech
 iske baad bhi pradhanmantri ne kaha ki sardaar kii pratimaa ko lekar raajnneeti nahin honi chahie
 His own speech is full of politics or really non-political speech, you have to decide
 darasal sardaar patel ke viraasat ke saath yahi badi ninsaphi he ki unki baat hameshaa nehru ke sandarbh main hoti he, jabaki unka jivan gandhi ke sandarbh main tha
 He never claimed the prime minister's post, nor did the factionalism for the post of Congress president
 ek baar jab vakaalat chhod di, aisho aaraam chhod diya to jivan bhar ke liye chhod diya
 Both Nehru and Patel were aware of what kind of discussion they had
 disambar 1950 main doctoron ke kehane par patel ko dilli chhodana pad rahaa tha
 Before leaving Patel told MV Gadgil that i will not live anymore
 mujhase ek vaada karo
 Gadgil said yes, then Patel took his hand in his hand and said that there should be as many differences as you have with Panditji, but do not leave him
 ye the sardaar patel
 Rajmohan Gandhi has written this passage on page number 532 in Patel's biography
 2 aktubar 1950 ko kaha tha ki jawaharlal nehru hi hamaare netaa hai
 Bapu has appointed him as his successor
 or isaki ghoshnaa bhi unhone kii he
 It is the duty of all the soldiers of Bapu to follow the orders of Jawaharlal ji
 main bevafa sipaahi nahin hum
 i never thought about the place i am
 main to itnaa jaanata hum ki mujhe jahaan rakhaa tha main waha hum
 Why did Sardar Patel tell Gadgil while leaving Delhi, promise not to leave Jawahar alone
 donon ke bich thos matbhed the magar aapasi sammaan bhi thos tha
 Maniben Patel was Sardar's daughter
 dahyabhai patel vallabhbhai patel unke bete the
 After the death of Sardar Patel, Dahyabhai Patel won the Lok Sabha elections in 1957 and 1962 on a Congress ticket
 maniben congress ke tikat par 1952 or 1957 main loksabhaa ke liye chuni gayi or phir rajyasabha bhi gayi
 Maniben opposed the Emergency and then won the election from Mehsana in 1977 on a Janata Party ticket
 shesh narayan singh ne apane fasebuk pej par yah jaankaree di he
 It is also sad to give information that through which glasses we have started seeing history
 itihaas samajhane ke liye hota he, hisaab ke liye nahin
 Today is the death anniversary of Indira Gandhi
 isi din indira gandhi kii hatya hui thi or uske baad sikhon ke saath narsanhaar hua tha
 It is a strange match
 kahin sardaar ko bada kiya ja rahaa he to kahin indira ko
 It is being written in the competition that Indira too broke Pakistan into two
 america ke aage nahin jhukin
 Prime Minister Modi has paid tribute to him through a tweet
 unke twit main 84 ke dangon kaa koi zikr nahin he
 Ideally both sides should have remembered the Sikhs who were killed
 isse hamaare raajnneeti badi banati na ki choti ho jaati
 It would have been nice had Rahul Gandhi and Narendra Modi also remembered the Sikhs who were killed in the carnage, to keep politics away from violence even today, it would have been known how well our leaders think about violence later
 in tasveeron main aap rahul gandhi or sonia gandhi ke alaava anya congressi netaaon ko dekh rahe hai
 Rahul Gandhi has remembered Indira Gandhi personally and also as a politician
 congress par aarope lagata he ki usne patel kii viraasat ko kabhi aage nahin kiya
 Congress should think about where the opportunity to accuse him came from
 aisa nahin he ki patel ke naam par santhaan, airport, aspataal, yaa nagar nahin hai
 Still, the answer has to be given to the Congress as to why it remained uneasy about Patel
 pichley chaar saal main congress ke netaa or kaaryakarta nehru par hone vaale anaap shanaap hamalon kaa bhi bachaav nahin kar paae
 What will Patel defend? rahul gandhi ne twit kiya he ki sardaar patel rashtrabhakt the jinhone azaadi, ekta or secular bharat kii ladaai ladi
 Steele's intended chieftain was full of compassion, a heartfelt Congressman who never tolerated fanaticism or communalism
 unki janmashati par bharat ke is mahaan sapoot ko salaam karata hum
 With this, another tweet from Rahul is that it is also ironic that the statue of Sardar Patel is being unveiled, but the institutions he built are all being demolished
 bharat kii sansthaaon kaa vyavasthit rup se khandit kiya janaa deshdoh se kam nahin he
 The image of unity has been created, but today there is a need for Sardar
 jab hamaari raajnneeti hindu hone yaa na hone, asli hindu hone yaa nakli hindu hone kii bahes main chali jaae to yahi vakt he apane bheetar us sardaar ko khojane kaa jo kahin gum ho gaye hai
 Who were against communalism like iron
 1941 main jab ahmedabad main dange bhadak uthe tab sardaar patel ne kaha tha aapako ekaek yah kya soojha ki aap ek-duusare ke gale kaatane lage
 i am sad that our father left
 ahmedabad shahar ke naam par kalank lag gaya
 How to delete it
 ise mitaane kaa ek hi tarika he ki ham is baat kii koshish karen ki dubaara is shahar main aisa vaataavaran paidaa na ho
 In 2002, Ahmadabad was again stained
 kya aaj ke din 84 or 2002 ke dangon ke prati sabhi ko praayshchit nahin karnaa chahie tha
 When Gandhi was assassinated, it was Patel
 unhone tab aresas par pratibandh lagaaya
 Rather, citing information under his ministry, it was clear that the people of the Sangh had distributed sweets after the murder
 11 sitambar 1948 ko patel se aresas ke sarasanghachaalak em es golwalkar ko patr likhaa tha ki hinduon ko sangathit karnaa or unki sahaayta karnaa ek baat he, lekin apni takalifon ke liye besahaara or maasoom purushon, auraton or bacchon se badla lenaa bilkul duusari baat
 Apart from this, it was also that his Congress opposition, that too with the strictness that neither the care of personality, nor of civilization, nor of civility, created a kind of uneasiness in the public
 inke saare bhaashan sampradayik vish se bhare the
 It was not necessary to instill enthusiasm among the Hindus and to manage their defense that poison spread
 is zehar kaa fal ant main yahi hua ki gandhi ji kii amuly jaan kii qurbaani desh ko sahani padi
 The entire sympathy of the government and people was not with the RSS, but against them
 gandhi ji kii mrityu par aresas waalon ne jo harsh prakat kiya or mithai banti, usase yah virodh or bhi bad gaya
 In these circumstances, there was no other way for the government to take steps against the RSS
 is pratimaa ko lekar sardaar sarovar baandh ke aas paas ke gaanv ke logon ne sawaal uthaae hai
 People from 72 villages said that they would observe a fast in protest against the unveiling of the statue on 31 October
 chulhaa band rahegaa
 The heads of 22 villages have written a letter to the Prime Minister that the forests, rivers, waterfalls, fields here have taken care of us for centuries
 ham inhen ke aasare jite rahe hai, lekin ab sab nasht kiya ja rahaa he
 Don't you think it's like celebrating someone's death
 hamen to aisa hi lagata he
 We villagers want to say with great sadness that we will not welcome you on 31 October
 aap bin bulaae mehmaan kii tarah aaenge to ham aapkaa swaagat nahin karenge
 If Sardar Patel had seen how natural resources are being destroyed, injustice is being done to us, he would have cried
 jab ham apni awaz uthaa rahe hai, aapaki police karrwai kar rahi he
 Why are you not ready to listen to our problems? lekin pradhanmantri ne kaha he ki is pratimaa ke kaaran aas paas ke adivasee logon ko rojgaar milegaa
 The Prime Minister also said that such a unity nursery should be built here so that the tourist coming here should take the plant of unity to his home and sow comments
 ab imtahaan aapkaa he, aap yani janata kaa
 Has become a tourist spot
 isliye yah spot muft nahin he
 You also should not feel that you are visiting Sardar for free, so there is a system of online tickets
 do prakaar ke tikat hai
 3-year-olds will not get tickets
 Observation Deck view, Valley of Flower, Memorial, Museum & Audio Visual Gallery, SOU site, Sardar Sarovar Dam dekhne ke liye 350 rupee ke tikat lagenge
 If you do not want to go to Observation Deck view, then there is a separate package for that
 praudh logon ko 60 rupee kaa tikat lagegaa or bacchon ko 60 rupee
 The bus charge is 30 rupees
 tikat ke maamle main bhi sardaar kii pratimaa bharat ke kai mehalon, kilon or imaaraton se mahangi ho gai he
 It would not be right to say expensive, it should be said that ticket prices are also the highest
 jabaki dilli ke laal kile kaa tikat 35 rupaya he, tajmahal kaa 50 rupaya
 Every year 70 to 80 lakh tourists come to see Taj Mahal, out of which 8 lakh are foreign tourists, there is a ticket of 1100 rupees for foreign tourists
 tajmahal se 20 karod kii kamai hoti he
 At the moment when two CBI officers have been thrown out of office for suing each other, the third officer is also facing charges, the Reserve Bank of India is fighting for its autonomy, even on the Election Commission Questions are being raised
 pradhanmantri patel ke banaae hue steel frem ko yaad kar rahe hai
 The warlord who fought for everyone, everyone is fighting for that chieftain
 isliye sardaar sardaar the, unhen lekar ladane vaale sardaar nahin ho sakate hai

 The Prime Minister also said that such a unity nursery should be built here so that the tourist coming here should take the plant of unity to his home and sow comments
 ab imtahaan aapkaa he, aap yani janata kaa

 The bus charge is 30 rupees

 Today is the death anniversary of Indira Gandhi
 isi din indira gandhi kii hatya hui thi or uske baad sikhon ke saath narsanhaar hua tha
 It is a strange match
 kahin sardaar ko bada kiya ja rahaa he to kahin indira ko
 It is being written in the competition that Indira too broke Pakistan into two
 america ke aage nahin jhukin
 Prime Minister Modi has paid tribute to him through a tweet
 unke twit main 84 ke dangon kaa koi zikr nahin he
 Ideally both sides should have remembered the Sikhs who were killed
 isse hamaare raajnneeti badi banati na ki choti ho jaati
 It would have been nice had Rahul Gandhi and Narendra Modi also remembered the Sikhs who were killed in the carnage, to keep politics away from violence even today, it would have been known how well our leaders think about violence later
 in tasveeron main aap rahul gandhi or sonia gandhi ke alaava anya congressi netaaon ko dekh rahe hai
 Rahul Gandhi has remembered Indira Gandhi personally and also as a politician
 congress par aarope lagata he ki usne patel kii viraasat ko kabhi aage nahin kiya
 Congress should think about where the opportunity to accuse him came from
 aisa nahin he ki patel ke naam par santhaan, airport, aspataal, yaa nagar nahin hai
 Still, the answer has to be given to the Congress as to why it remained uneasy about Patel
 pichley chaar saal main congress ke netaa or kaaryakarta nehru par hone vaale anaap shanaap hamalon kaa bhi bachaav nahin kar paae
 What will Patel defend? rahul gandhi ne twit kiya he ki sardaar patel rashtrabhakt the jinhone azaadi, ekta or secular bharat kii ladaai ladi
 Steele's intended chieftain was full of compassion, a heartfelt Congressman who never tolerated fanaticism or communalism
 unki janmashati par bharat ke is mahaan sapoot ko salaam karata hum
 With this, another tweet from Rahul is that it is also ironic that the statue of Sardar Patel is being unveiled, but the institutions he built are all being demolished
 bharat kii sansthaaon kaa vyavasthit rup se khandit kiya janaa deshdoh se kam nahin he
 The image of unity has been created, but today there is a need for Sardar
 jab hamaari raajnneeti hindu hone yaa na hone, asli hindu hone yaa nakli hindu hone kii bahes main chali jaae to yahi vakt he apane bheetar us sardaar ko khojane kaa jo kahin gum ho gaye hai
 Who were against communalism like iron
 1941 main jab ahmedabad main dange bhadak uthe tab sardaar patel ne kaha tha aapako ekaek yah kya soojha ki aap ek-duusare ke gale kaatane lage
 i am sad that our father left
 ahmedabad shahar ke naam par kalank lag gaya
 How to delete it
 ise mitaane kaa ek hi tarika he ki ham is baat kii koshish karen ki dubaara is shahar main aisa vaataavaran paidaa na ho
 In 2002, Ahmadabad was again stained
 kya aaj ke din 84 or 2002 ke dangon ke prati sabhi ko praayshchit nahin karnaa chahie tha
 When Gandhi was assassinated, it was Patel
 unhone tab aresas par pratibandh lagaaya
 Rather, citing information under his ministry, it was clear that the people of the Sangh had distributed sweets after the murder
 11 sitambar 1948 ko patel se aresas ke sarasanghachaalak em es golwalkar ko patr likhaa tha ki hinduon ko sangathit karnaa or unki sahaayta karnaa ek baat he, lekin apni takalifon ke liye besahaara or maasoom purushon, auraton or bacchon se badla lenaa bilkul duusari baat
 Apart from this, it was also that his Congress opposition, that too with the strictness that neither the care of personality, nor of civilization, nor of civility, created a kind of uneasiness in the public
 inke saare bhaashan sampradayik vish se bhare the
 It was not necessary to instill enthusiasm among the Hindus and to manage their defense that poison spread
 is zehar kaa fal ant main yahi hua ki gandhi ji kii amuly jaan kii qurbaani desh ko sahani padi
 The entire sympathy of the government and people was not with the RSS, but against them
 gandhi ji kii mrityu par aresas waalon ne jo harsh prakat kiya or mithai banti, usase yah virodh or bhi bad gaya
 In these circumstances, there was no other way for the government to take steps against the RSS
 is pratimaa ko lekar sardaar sarovar baandh ke aas paas ke gaanv ke logon ne sawaal uthaae hai
 People from 72 villages said that they would observe a fast in protest against the unveiling of the statue on 31 October
 chulhaa band rahegaa
 The heads of 22 villages have written a letter to the Prime Minister that the forests, rivers, waterfalls, fields here have taken care of us for centuries
 ham inhen ke aasare jite rahe hai, lekin ab sab nasht kiya ja rahaa he
 Don't you think it's like celebrating someone's death
 hamen to aisa hi lagata he
 We villagers want to say with great sadness that we will not welcome you on 31 October
 aap bin bulaae mehmaan kii tarah aaenge to ham aapkaa swaagat nahin karenge
 If Sardar Patel had seen how natural resources are being destroyed, injustice is being done to us, he would have cried
 jab ham apni awaz uthaa rahe hai, aapaki police karrwai kar rahi he
 Why are you not ready to listen to our problems? lekin pradhanmantri ne kaha he ki is pratimaa ke kaaran aas paas ke adivasee logon ko rojgaar milegaa

 The warlord who fought for everyone, everyone is fighting for that chieftain
 isliye sardaar sardaar the, unhen lekar ladane vaale sardaar nahin ho sakate hai
 The Congress is accused of never carrying forward Patel's legacy
 congress ko sochna chahie ki us par yah aarope lagane kaa mauka kahaan se aayaa
 It is not that there are no institutions, airports, hospitals, or cities named after Patel
 phir bhi yah jawaab congress ko dena he ki vah patel ko lekar kyon asahaj rahi
 In the last four years, Congress leaders and activists have not been able to defend the outrageous attacks on Nehru
 patel kaa bachaav kya karenge
 Rahul Gandhi has tweeted that Sardar Patel was a patriot who fought for freedom, unity and secular India
 steel ke iraade vaale sardaar karunaa se bhare the, ve dil se congressi the, jinhone dharmandhta yaa sampradayakita ko kabhi bardaasht nahin kiya
 i salute this great son of India on his birth anniversary
 isi ke saath rahul kaa ek or twit he ki yah bhi vidambnaa he ki sardaar patel kii pratimaa kaa anaavaran ho rahaa he, lekin unhone jin sansthaanon ko banaaya ve sabhi dhahaae ja rahe hai
 Systematic fragmentation of India's institutions is nothing short of treason
 ekta kii pratimaa to ban gai, lekin aaj vaaki sardaar kii zarurat he
 When our politics goes into the debate of being a Hindu or not, being a real Hindu or being a fake Hindu, then it is time to search for the Sardar who has gone missing
 jo lohe kii tarah sampradayikta ke khilaaf the
 In 1941, when riots broke out in Ahmedabad, Sardar Patel said that what made you suddenly think that you started biting each other
 mujhe dukh is baat kaa he ki hamaari aabru chali gayi
 The name of the city of Ahmedabad was blurred
 kaise mitaayaa jaae ise
 The only way to erase it is to try to ensure that such an environment does not arise in this city again
 2002 main ahambadabad par phir se kalank laga tha
 Shouldn't everyone atone for the 84 and 2002 riots to this day? jab gandhi kii hatya hui tab grahamantri patel hi the
 He then banned the RSS
 balki apane mantralay ke adheen soochnaaon kaa hawala dete hue saaf-saaf kaha ki hatya ke baad sangh ke logon ne mithai banti thi
 On 11 September 1948, he wrote a letter to Patel's RSS sarsanghchalak MS Golwalkar that it is one thing to organize and help Hindus, but to take revenge on the helpless and innocent men, women and children for their suffering is another matter
 iske alaava ye bhi tha ki unke congress virodh ne, wo bhi is kathorta se ki na vyaktitv kaa khyaal, na sabhyataa kaa, na shishtataa kaa, janata main ek prakaar kii bechaini paidaa kar di
 All his speeches were full of communal poison
 hinduon main josh paidaa karnaa va unki raksha ke prabandh karne ke liye aavashwayak na tha ki zehar faile
 The result of this poison was in the end that the country had to bear the sacrifice of Gandhiji's priceless life
 sarkaar va janata kii ratti bhar sahanubhuti aresas ke saath na rahi, balki unke khilaaf ho gai
 The protest was further intensified by the joy expressed by the RSS people on Gandhiji's death and distributed sweets
 in halaat main sarkaar ko aresas ke khilaaf kadam uthaane ke alaava koi or rasta nahin bachaa tha
 People of the village around Sardar Sarovar Dam have raised questions about this statue
 72 gaanv ke logon ne kaha ki 31 aktubar ko pratimaa ke anaavaran ke virodh main upwas rakhenge
 The stove will remain closed
 22 gaanvon ke pradhanon ne pradhanmantri ko patr likhaa he ki yahaan ke jangalon, nadiyon, jalprapaaton, kheton ne sadiyon se hamaara khyaal rakhaa he
 We have been living around them, but now everything is being destroyed
 kya aapako nahin lagata ki yah kisi kii maut par jashn ke samaan he
 We think so only
 ham gaanv vaale bahut dukh ke saath kahana chaahate hai ki ham 31 aktubar ko aapkaa swaagat nahin karenge
 If you come like an uninvited guest, we will not welcome you
 agar sardaar patel ne dekha hota ki kaise prakritik sansadhano ko nasht kiya ja rahaa he, hamaare saath anyaay ho rahaa he to ve ro dete
 While we are raising our voice, your police is taking action
 aap hamaari takalifon ko sunne ke liye taiyaar kyon nahin hai
 But the Prime Minister has said that due to this statue, the tribal people around will get employment
 pradhanmantri ne yah bhi kaha ki yahaan ek aisi ekta nursery bane ki yahaan aane vaala tourist apane ghar ekta kaa paudha le jaae or boetippaniyan Now the examination is yours, you, the public
 tourist spot ban gaya he
 So this spot is not free
 aapako bhi ye na lage ki aap sardaar kaa darshan muft main kar rahe hai isliye online tikat kii vyavastha he
 There are two types of tickets
 3 saal ke bacchon ko tikat nahin lagegaa
 It will cost Rs 350 to see Observation Deck view, Valley of Flower, Memorial, Museum & Audio Visual Gallery, SOU site, Sardar Sarovar Dam
 agar aap Observation Deck view, nahin janaa chahenge to uske liye alag se package he
 Adult people will get 60 rupees tickets and children 60 rupees
 bas kaa charge he 30 rupaya
 In the case of tickets too, Sardar's statue has become expensive with many palaces, forts and buildings in India
 mahangi kahana thik nahin hoga, kahana chahie ki tikat ke daam bhi sabase oonche hai
 While the ticket for the Red Fort of Delhi is 35 rupees, the Taj Mahal is 50 rupees
 tajmahal dekhne ke liye har saal 70 se 80 lakh paryatak aate hai, jinamein se 8 lakh videshi paryatak hote hai videshi paryatakon ke liye 1100 rupye kaa tikat he
 The Taj Mahal earns 20 crores
 is samay jab sibiai ke do-do afasar ek duusare par mukadmaa karne ke kaaran daftar se baahar kar die gaye hai, tisare afasar par bhi aarope lag rahe hai, reserve bank of india apni swaittata ke liye sangharsh kar rahaa he, chunaav ayog par bhi sawaal uth ja rahe hai
 The Prime Minister is remembering the steel frame made by Patel
 jo sardaar sabake liye lade, us sardaar ke liye sab lard rahe hai
 Therefore the Sardar was the Sardar, there cannot be a Sardar fighting over him
 rahul gandhi ne twit kiya he ki sardaar patel rashtrabhakt the jinhone azaadi, ekta or secular bharat kii ladaai ladi
 Steele's intended chieftain was full of compassion, a heartfelt Congressman who never tolerated fanaticism or communalism

 We have been living around them, but now everything is being destroyed

 We think so only
 ham gaanv vaale bahut dukh ke saath kahana chaahate hai ki ham 31 aktubar ko aapkaa swaagat nahin karenge
 If you come like an uninvited guest, we will not welcome you

 In the case of tickets too, Sardar's statue has become expensive with many palaces, forts and buildings in India

 While the ticket for the Red Fort of Delhi is 35 rupees, the Taj Mahal is 50 rupees

 500 or 1000 rupee ke note band chuke hai or ab yah un logon ke liye kaagaj ke tukade jaise hai jinhone imaanadaaree se nahin kamaaye the
 However, it can be deposited in the bank till next month
 atm ke baahar 100 rupee ke note ke liye lambii qatari lagi hui he
 The 1000 rupee note was closed forever but a new 500 rupee note will come
 iske alaava ab bazaar main 2000 ke note bhi dekhne ko milenge
 Ignore the rumors, if you are getting information on whatsapp or in the message that the new 2000 note will have Nano GPS Chip (NGC), then this information is absolutely wrong
 aisi kisi bhi jaankaree kii pushti na to sarkaar ne or na hi rigerv bank of india ne aadhikarik taur par kii he
 PM Modi mentioned any such thing in his speech yesterday
 aapako bataa den ki zyaadaatar jeepies divaais kaa istemaal ghar ke andar nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 Therefore it is neither possible nor practical that RBI has installed Nano GPS chip in all 2000 notes through which all people can be tracked
 aisa isliye bhi sambhav nahin he, kyonki logon ko trek karnaa unki ritis chhinane jaisaa he
 Even assuming a Gps device is installed on 2000 notes, can billions of news notes in the country be monitored real time? Has this been done in any country of the world? You can find the answer yourself
 haalanki itnaa jarur he ki 2000 rupee ke nae note main nae fitures die gaye hai jisaki vajah ye pehle ke mukaable zyada sicyor hoga or iskaa nakli bananaa mushkil hoga
 The color scheme of the new note has been changed and this time its base color will be magenta
 or iskaa dizin bhi pehle se kaaphi alag he
 Now 500 and 2000 notes will also be written in Devanagari and the photo of Mahatma Gandhi will now be in the middle
 note ke peeche mangalayan kaa chitra or swach bharat abhiyaan kaa logo hoga
 These new notes will be signed by the new RBI Governor Urjit Patel
 agar aapako nae note se judi koi bhi jaankaree chahie to behatar rahegaa aap rigerv bank of india kii website par ja kar vistaar pard len
 However, since last night, the RBI website is stopping down and it has stopped many times

 Following the order of the Supreme Court, the Rajasthan government has started seizing the bar of the hotels on the National Highway
 rajasthan ke aabkaari vibhaag ne aadesh nikaala he ki neshnal haive ke 500 meter ke andar ke sabhi sharaab dukaanon or hotalon ke baar ko band kar diya jaae, or unke license kaa navinikaran bhi nahin kiya jayega
 In fact, the Rajasthan government changed the name of the state highway to Urban Road and saved the bar of shops and hotels, but to change the name of the national highway requires permission from the center, so the bar is being seized here
 jaipur se hokar teen neshnal haive guzarate hai
 National Highway-8, National Highway-11 and National Highway-13 are urban areas on these three highways where many big and five star hotels are built
 vahiin sarkaar ne pehle hi haive ko notiphoi kar urban road bana diya tha, magar jo ilaaka jaipur nagar nigam ke daayre main nahin aata he vahaan par bane bade hotalon or regart ke baar ko sij kiya ja rahaa he
 On receiving the Rajasthan Government order, the Excise Officer reached the Amber Villa Palace on Tok Road, where the liquor stock was removed and the bar was sealed
 isi sadak par jaipur kaa mashhoor resort chokhi dhani bhi he jahaan ke bhi baar band ho gaye
 Excise officer of Rajasthan Niranjan Arya says that all this was due to states like Maharashtra, Kerala and Telangana, who went to the Supreme Court to review the Supreme Court's decision to close the liquor shops along the highway
 pehle supreme court ne keval sharaab kii dukaanon par hi aadesh die the lekin rivyuu petishan ke faisle main hotel ke baar ko bhi shaamil kar liya
 According to the Excise Officer, only 15 percent of liquor shops and hotels in Rajasthan will be affected by the decision of the Supreme Court
 lekin lee maradian, fairmount, chokhi dhani jaise bade hotel jo karodo kaa investment kar rakhe hai unka kya hoga
 Actually this case was going on since 2007, when the Rajasthan government had sensibly made the urban part of the three National Highways to be built in Urban Road, so only big hotels built on the outskirts would come into its grip
 neshnal haive ko urban road bananaane ke liye centre sarkaar ke bhoolat parivahan mantralay se parmishan lenaa padataa he, lekin jis tarah se desh main sharaab ke khilaaf maahaul bana he
 The state government does not want to get angry with the Supreme Court by taking permission from the Center
 haalanki sutron ke anusaar jin bade hotalon ke baar band ho rahe hai wo 500 meter ke daayre ke baahar apana baar bana sakate hai

 Actress Alia Bhatt says that actors have to go through the pressure of giving better performances in every film, but she does not feel insecure
 haa, kai baar vah asahaj avashya ho jaati hai
 The actress, who stepped into Bollywood from the 2012 film 'student of the Year', followed this with films such as 'highway', 'two-states', 'humpty Sharma Ki Dulhania', 'kapoor & Sons' and 'udta Punjab' Of
 pichley saal ai unki film 'shandaar' haalanki, kuch khaas kamaal nahin kar pai
 When asked about the feeling of insecurity an artist feels, "alia said," i feel that there is pressure on an artist to give a better performance in every film, which makes you worried about your situation
 main in sabhi chizon se kabhi asurakshit nahin mahasoos karti, par kai baar asahaj ho jaati hum
 " nirdeshak mahesh bhatta or beete jamaane kii abhinetri soni razdan kii beti aalia kaa kahana he ki jab vah asahaj mahasoos karti hai, to parivaar kaa samarthan unhen isse baahar aane main madad karata he
 (apart from the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it has been published directly from the Syndicate feed
 )(hedline ke alaava, is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he, yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he
 ) suna tha jab do premi milte hai to aasmaan main jashn manaaya jaataa he, lekin jab do premi juda hote hai tab kya hota he? main bataati hum kya hota he ladki aadhi film ke liye gaayab ho jaati he or ladkaa tabaahi ke raste par chal padataa he
 Even after lakhs of people, it does not improve and then something happens that you sit holding your head
 film kabir singh kii baat karen to ye buree nahin he lekin arjuna reddy kaa puraa kaa puraa rip of he
 That means the dialog is also the boss
 ye kahani he kabir rajvir singh kii he, jo im se padhai kar rahaa he or vahaan kaa topper student he
 Kabir is very good in studies, tops every field, even is the captain of college football team
 lekin kabir kii sirf ek hi dikkat he, use gussa bahut aata he
 When i spoke a lot, i mean a lot
 itnaa zyada ki wo kisi kii jaan le saktaa he
 Then one day Preeti comes into Kabir's life, who is one of the first year students of the college
 priti kii saadagi dekhakar kabir ko usase pyaar ho jaataa he, lekin baad main ye donon juda ho jate hai or phir shuru hota he kabir kaa barbaadi ke raste par chalane kaa kissa
 Now Kabir drinks liquor day and night, does everything from cannabis to cocaine and is working as a surgeon in the hospital
 priti uske dimag se jaati nahin
 It is not his nature to think of someone else
 kalakaaron kii actingpraformens kii baat karen to shahid kapur, kabir singh ke kirdaar main jabardast hai
 a stubborn, stubborn boy who is always angry
 aisa kirdaar nibhaana koi aasaan kaam nahin he
 It is more difficult to play the role of an alcoholic and Shahid has done this job very easily
 priti ke role main kiyaara adwani acchhee hai
 He has played Preity's character well and maintains her simplicity
 kuch seens main kiyaara aapako chaunkaa bhi detii hai or aap unke kaam kii daad dete hai
 Kabir's father turned actor Suresh Oberoi in the supporting role, Arjan Bajwa in the role of his brother, Adil Hussain in the role of the dean of the college and the other actors have also done a great job
 lekin ek insaan jiske liye aapke dil me jagah ban jaaegi wo he kabir ke dost shiva ke role main actor soham majumdaar! soham ne kamaal kaa kaam kiya he
 That means if a human being gets friends in life, he should not meet Shiva or else
 kabir ke saath padhane karne se lekar uski jindagi bachaane or basaane kii koshish tak shiva wo sabakuch karata he jo ek acha dost aapke liye kar sake, balki usase bhi or bahut zyada kuch
 The chemistry of Shahid Kapoor and Kiara Advani is excellent
 unka pyaar, unka ek duusare ko lekar junun or paagalpan aapke seene main utar jaataa he
 One thing is certain from this film that you are going to remember this performance of Shahid Kapoor for many years to come
 kaisaa he diarectiondiarector sandip wanga ne is film ko arjuna reddy ke jaisaa seen tu seen copy banaaya he, jisase mujhe dikkat he
 If he had made Kabir Singh something differently than a copy of Arjun Reddy, it would have been better
 haalanki unka nirdesan acha he or unhone is film ko badhiya tareeke se banaaya he
 Yes, this film could have been a little shorter, because by reaching the end, you definitely wait for it to end soon
 film kaa mujeec kamaal he! mujeec ko bollywood ke badhiya compogers kii team- mithun, amaal malik, vishaal mishra, sachet-parampara or akhil sachdev ne banaaya he
 Every single song of it gets in your heart and makes you feel a lot
 bekhayaali pehle se hi logon kaa fevorett ban gaya he or aap film main ise sunne ke baad ise agle din tak gunagunaayenge
 Why watch the film, however, like nothing in the world is perfect, similarly Kabir Singh is also not a perfect film
 is film kii apni kamiyaan hai, jinhen nazarandaaj karnaa mushkil he
 But this is not at all the fact that you should not watch this film
 shahid kapur kii badhiya acting, kiyaara kii saadagi, soham kaa kabir kii parvaah or behtareen mujeec is film ko dekhne ke ahm kaaran hai
 Now further your wish! bangkok ke bare main ek kahawat he ki agar vahaan koi ek pathar uchhaalata he, to vah yaa to kisi juaari ko lagata he yaa kisi veshyalay ke dalal ko
 If this proverb is fitted in Gurgaon, then it can be said that the stone will be used either by a spa runner or a nightclub owner
 gudgaanv ke spa centre or nite klbon main sex kaa kaarobaar bhi khub fal-phool rahaa he
 There are several malls and luxury hotels on mehrauli-gurgaon (MG) Road, which run such spas and night clubs
 ye centre graahakon ko irotic massage jaisi suvidhaayen dete hai
 All this is served according to the customers' pockets and needs
 sex kaa kaarobaar raat main khub jor pakadta he, khaskar 9 baje ke baad
 The brokers who run the clubs and spas deploy clients through them
 khub mol-bhav ke baad jaakar rate tay kiye jate hai
 Once the customer enters the club, the bar girl also openly tells the rate
 30 minute ke liye 300 rupee se lekar 500 rupee tak liye jate hai
 Bar Girl Shweta (name changed) tells, 'it is very easy to make money here
 ham har raat 4 hajaar se lekar 5 hajaar rupee tak kama lete hai, lekin 50 fisadi tak rupee baar ko dena padataa he
 According to Shweta, most of the times girls of the club are ready to give 'sexual service' to the customers
 exise or iskar vibhaag ke adhikariyon ke mutabik, akele gudgaanv main hi aise 60 se zyada nite club hai, jahaan sex kaa kaarobaar chalata he
 When Verma was asked what kind of action is available on such written application, he says that this matter is related to natural phenomena, so no action can be taken on it
 (is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he
 This is published directly from Syndicate Feed) (NDTV team has not edited this news
 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he) Muktada Hasan Nida Fazli was such a fan of Urdu and Hindi, whose poetry on the paper of time is such that even the sisters will not be able to blur it
 12 oktober, 1938 ko vah dilli main paidaa hue
 The father was a poet, so he was named after the elder brother's name by the name of Muqtada Hasan
 unka bachapan or kishoravay madhyapradesh ke gwalior main beetaa
 Study also took place there
 muktada hasan bachapan se hi kuchkuch likhane lage the
 Nida Fazli is his authoritative name
 nida kaa arth he swar yani awaz or fazli kashmir ke us ilaake faazila se aayaa he, jahaan se unke purvaj dilli aae the
 Nevertheless, the incident of Nida Fazli's arrival in urdu-hindi language became an accident
 kehete hai jab vah college main the tab apane saamne kii seat par baithne vaali ek ladki se unhone ekatarfa, anjaanaa, abola rishta garh liya tha
 It was not the era nowadays, where even the love is done without any shame
 tab kishoravay par tamaam bandishen numaya thim
 The boom of emotions would not have crossed the threshold of social bonds so easily
 aisi hi manodasha main muktada hasan ke man ke angan kaa ankur pushp ban khilata ki achaanak college ke notice board par jaise bam kaa sa dhamaakaa hua
 In Hindi, what was written on the notice board was something like, 'kumari Tandon has become an accident, and now she has died
 is khabar se nida andar tak hill gaye, du:khee hue
 But to express his sorrow, he did not have the right word Salika
 unhone mahasusa ki vah jo kuch bhi likh rahe, vah is dukh ko vyakt karne main naakaam he
 After a lot of hard work, he came to understand that the fault lies in the way of not writing in words
 vah jo likh rahe usamen aisa kuch bhi nahin, jisase unke andar ke dukh kii girahen khul jaaen
 It is said that one day in the morning when he was passing by near a temple, someone got this famous hymn of Surdas' Madhuban tum kat rahat hare? Why don't you think of the beautiful Beaum Siom Sundar? Heard singing bas phir kya tha? muktada ko laga ki unke andar ke dukh kii girahen khul rahi hai
 After this, he became obsessed with reading devotional poets like Kabirdas, Tulsidas, Surdas, Baba Farid etc
 unhone tamaam sufi santon, sagun, nirgun brahm ke upaskon kii dohawaliyaan, bhajan, kirthan, lokrchanaayen baanch daaleen
 The more he read them, he came to the conclusion that the poems of these poets are simple, without any wrap, written in two-piece language
 surdaas kii 'udho, man na bhae das bees
 a huto so gaye siam sang, ko aradhai te eis', or what is mirza ghalib's' Dil-e-nadan tujha hai? ' After all, what is this pain medicine? ' Just then, this journey of Swadhyay was successful in transforming Mukhtada Hasan into a great poet like Nida Fazli
 baangi dekhen-khuda khamosh he!tum aao to takhliq ho duniyamein itane saare kaamon ko akelaa kar nahin saktasaral bhashaa sadaiv ke liye nida fazli kii apni style ban gai
 Tired of the hindu-muslim communal riots, when his parents migrated to Pakistan and settled, Nida stayed here in India
 kamai kii talash main vah kai shaharon main bhatke
 But where do you get work lekhan chalata rahaa, par kismat ne nida ke liye kuch or hi likh rakhaa tha
 That way Miri is involved in life wherever i go, it seems like your honor
 
 
 
 Did not reach the eyes like this
 bhopal, elahabaad, dilli nahin mumbai hindi or urdu sahitya kaa garh thi
 In the year 1964, Nida reached Mumbai in search of work
 dharmayug, blitz, sarika jaisi patr-patrikaon main unhone lekh likhane shuru kiye
 Started printing soon
 unki saral or prabhaavshaalee lekhan style ne jald hi unhen sammaan or shoharat dilaa di
 After that there is history
 yah nida hi likh sakate theadevataa he koi ham men farishta koichhu ke mat dekhnahar rang utar jaataa hamilane-julne kaa saleeqa he zaruri varnaadami chand mulaaqaaton main mar jaataa hanida fazli kii charchit pustakon main sankalan 'lafzon ke phool', 'mor naach', 'aankh or khwaab ke darmiyaan', 'khoyaa hua sa kuch', 'aankhon bhar akaash' or 'safar main dhoop to hogi'; aatmakatha 'deevaaron ke bich', 'deevaaron ke baahar'; sansmaran 'mulaaqaatein', 'safar main dhoop to hogi', 'tamaasha mere aage' shaamil he
 He also edited books written on some great poets
 jinamein 'bashir badr: nayi ghazal kaa ek naam', 'jannisar akhtar: ek jawan maut', 'daag dehalavi: ghazal kaa ek skool', 'mohammad alvi: shabdon kaa chitrakaar', 'jigar muradaabadi: muhabbaton kaa shaayar' kaaphi charchit rahe
 For writing, he has been honored with many honors like Sahitya Akademi Award, Qaumi Ekta Award, Madhya Pradesh Government's Mir Taqi Mir Award, Khusro Award, Maharashtra Urdu Academy Award, Bihar Urdu Academy Award, Uttar Pradesh Urdu Academy Award, Hindi Urdu Sangam Award
 Were
 filmi geet ke liye bhi unhen screen sahit kai anya puraskaar mili the
 The journey of Nida Fazli as a poet and lyricist was such a brilliant and poignant one can be judged by listening to his songs, ghazals, shayari
 kehete hai kamaal amrohi jab film razia sultan bana rahe the, to geet likhane kii jimmedaari jannisar akhtar par thi
 Jannisar died suddenly
 jannisar akhtar bhi gwalior se hi the or unhone kamaal amrohi ko shat-pratishat shuddh urdu bolne vaale ke rup main nida kaa zikr kar rakhaa tha
 Kamaal Amrohi approached Nida Fazli, agreeing to Jannisar Akhtar and asked him to write the remaining two songs of the film
 
 
 or phir nida ne kya geet rache
 Both of these songs were, first - 'tera Hijra Mein Naseeb Hatera Gham is Meri Hayat, Mujhe Teri Distance Ke Gham Ho Kehto Kuwait Ho Ho Mein Saath Hain
 
 
 'or doosraa geet tha-'ai zanjeer kii jhankaar khuda kair kare,dil hua kiskaa giraftaar khuda kair kare,jane yah koun meri ruh ko chhukar guzaraa,ek qayamat hui bedaar khuda kair kare
 
 
 'and thus began his film songwriting with so many great songs
 uske baad unhone kai filmon ke liye gane likhe
 Such films include 'sarfarosh', 'ahista-ahista', 'this Night's Morning No', 'sur' etc
 vah hindu ho yaa muslim donon kii hi kattarta ke virdohi the
 He was the target of established litterateurs for a long time to oppose the growing sycophancy and chauvinism in Indian literature
 apni pustak 'mulaaqaatein' main unhone bhartiya lekhan kii darbari pravriti ko nidarta se ujagar kiya, jiske chalate bahishkaar bhi jhela
 In the same way, this lion wrote - 'the mosque is far away from the house, let's do it to make a crying baby laugh,' he became the target of radical Muslims
 halaat ye the ki jab vah ek mushaayare main shaamil hone ke liye pakistan gaye to vahaan kattarpanthi mullaon ne unhen gher liya
 Mullahs expressed their opposition and asked whether Nida Fazli considers a child to be greater than Allah? Nida's answer was that i only know that mosques make the hands of a human being, whereas Allah makes the child with his own hands
 hindi-urdu ko samarpit is khaas shaayar ne 8 farvari 2016 ko is duniya se rukhsat kiya

 sahitya ajtak kii shradhanjali! In Nihal Vihar area of delhi, the son of a Congress leader hit the bike with a drunk car
 isse bike savaar do log ghayal ho gaye
 This car with red light was running at a speed of more than hundred kilometers per hour
 ghatana ke baad logon ne netaa ke bete kii buree tarah pitayee kar di or car ko bhi tod-phod daalaa
 The special thing is that the leaders are calling it a political conspiracy
 ghatana buudhvaar raat nihaal vihaar kii pipal vaali gali main hui
 According to the information, Faiz Saifi, son of Congress leader Shakeel Saifi, was going from Sultanpuri to Skoda car with his two friends
 car kii raftaar bahut tej thi or usee samay faij car par niyantran nahin rakh paaya
 The car first hit a bike and then crashed into a pole
 bike savaar do yuvak ghayal ho gaye
 Meanwhile, people gathered there and they beat Faiz badly
 naaraaz logon ne car main bear kii bottle dekhakar car ko buree tarah tod daalaa
 On receiving information about the case, the police reached the spot and admitted both the injured to Sanjay Gandhi Hospital
 vahiin, buree tarah ghayal phej ko bhi aspataal main bhartee karaayaa gaya
 According to Ranveer Singh, DCP of West District, two separate cases have been registered in this regard
 faij ke khilaaf laaparvaahee se gaadi chalaakar durghatana karne kaa or jin logon ne uske saath marpet kii he, unke khilaaf bhi exiaar darj kii gai he
 According to the DCP, it has been confirmed in the medical examination that Faiz was intoxicated at the time of the incident
 jaanch main paaya gaya he ki laal batti lagi car shakeel ke ek dost kii he
 Police is investigating why a red light was installed on it
 faij ke pita shakeel saifi congress se jude hai or vah sensor board ke member bhi rahe hai
 Apart from this, he has also been involved in the Haj Committee of the Delhi Government
 hairat kii baat yah he ki shakeel saifi is ghatana ko virodhiyon kii sajeesh bataa rahe hai
 There was so much toughness in the electoral atmosphere and how can one move around in a red light car

 aankadon ke lihaaj se aap kii sarkaar surakshit dikh rahi he lekin phir bhi siem sahab ko kisi sajeesh kaa dar sata rahaa he
 The reason for Kejriwal's fear is probably justified as the news is that some Congress mlas are dissatisfied with the support of AAP and 3 mlas can vote against the confidence motion
 haalanki kejariwal kii shankaa ko congress unka dimagi fitur bataa rahi he
 The equation is clear, Kejriwal's government rests on the Congress, that is, it is on him to topple and save the government
 haalanki congress maujuuda halaat main haath khinchne se parhez hi karegi lekin siyasat main daanvpech main samarthan kaa sansar bada hi najuk hota he
 The AAP has 28 mlas in the 70-member assembly and 36 legislators will be needed to prove a majority in the assembly
 iske liye use 8 vidhayakon ke samarthan kii jarurat hogi
 While the Congress has eight mlas, the BJP and its ally Akali Dal have a total of 32 mlas

 When the questions of unemployment and employment generation of the last 3 years were asked to the Minister of Skill Development in the Government of India, Rajiv Pratap Rudy said that if you think that the Ministry of Skill Development formed on the initiative of Narendra Modi Government will provide you with employment, then maybe Your thinking is right and wrong
 sahi isliye ki wo yuvaaon ko kaushal yani hunar sikhaane kaa kaam karata he lekin mantralay kaa kaam kisi ko rojgaar dilaanaa katai nahin he
 They were asked to remove unemployment figures in the last three years

 Apparently, his ministry has been considered as a nodal agency for generating employment
 isliye patrakaron kii dilchaspee bhi is baat ko jaanane main thi ki teen saal main jobles growth ke jo aarope vipaksh ne lagaae hanus par mantriji kaa kya kahana he
 Rudy even went as far as to say that his ministry was the highest functioning ministry
 uskaa muqaabala saath saal se chale aa rahe mantralayon se naa kiya jaae
 He said that in the last three years, his ministry started by setting up a chair table
 17 karodayuvaaon ko hunarmandabanane kaa kaam kar rahaa he
 Describing future plans, Rudy said that the Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Kendras will be opened in 480 districts soon
 inamen training dene waalon kii training par bhi jor rahegaa
 Apart from this, 100 International Skill Centers will also be started soon
 inaki vajah se baahar jaakar naukari paanaa bhi aasaan ho jayega
 Demonetisation is a tragedy

 vipaksh partiyon ne is faisle kaa khub virodh kiya tha

 During the meeting, the Cabinet discussed making separate legislation for Citizen's Charter, which i believe is completely wrong
 ’unhone kaha, ‘yah galat he kyonki jab main ramlila maidan main anshan kar rahaa tha tab pradhanmantri ne mujhe patr likhakar yah aashwaasan dete hue anshan samaapt karne ko kaha tha ki teen mahatvapurn bindu citigen charter, nichali naukarshahi or rajya lokayukta vidheyak kaa hissaa honge or sansad ne isse sahmati jataayi thi

 uttar pradesh vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan 'upi ke ladke' sapa pramukh akhilesh yadav or congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi milakar chunaav lade the lekin nateeja paksh main nahin aayaa
 The BJP gained power in the state with an overwhelming majority
 ek saal baad hathi-cycle kii jodi gorakhpur or phulpur main saath ai to bijepi ke garh main sapa-basapa ne paracham laharaa diya
 That is, the political signal of UP is clear, the SP-BSP likes it but the Congress is not as effective
 isi sanket ko ab akhilesh yadav or mayawati samajhane lage hai or donon netaaon ne rahul gandhi ke netritv vaali desh kii mukhya vipakshi party se kanni kaatna shuru kar diya he
 Sources say that Akhilesh Yadav considers the Congress along with the Congress responsible for the party's misery in UP elections
 saath hi unka maananaa he ki congress ko raibareli or amethi ke alaava koi or seat nahin di ja sakati
 In the last Lok Sabha elections, the Congress was able to win these two traditional seats
 us dauraan 'sapa parivaar' ne 5 siten jiti thim jabaki basapa kaa to supada-saaf ho gaya tha
 If the SP-BSP alliance with the Congress, then both these parties will have to give up many seats for the pawns, which neither of these two parties want
 siton par samjhaute ke mood main nahin basapabaspa pramukh mayawati pehle hi sanket de chuki hai ki ve gathbandhan hone ke baavjood siton ko lekar kai samjhauta karne ke mood main nahin hai
 In 80-seat UP, Mayawati is contesting 40 seats as her natural claim
 gathbandhan ke liye samjhaute kii mej par baithne ke samay ho saktaa he ki ve kuch narmi laakar chaar-paanch siten chhod bhi den lekin iske kam to basapa ko katai manjuur nahin hoga
 In such a situation, where will the seats left for Congress come from? akhilesh qurbaani ko taiyaar, magar kitni?akhilesh yadav saarvajanik rup se kah chuke hai ki wo bada dil dikhaaenge or gathbandhan ke liye jaruri hua to kuch siten chhod bhi denge lekin ye ‘kuch’ kitna hoga ye saaf nahin he
 At a time when there are chances of becoming non-bjp-non-congress prime minister at the Center, no regional party will bend more than a boundary
 akhilesh kii sapa bhi isse alag nahin he
 Apart from this, the way SP and BSP vacated the field for RLD in Nurpur, RLD is also ready to join this alliance and stake claim on some seats
 siton ke is tarah bantwaare main congress ke liye kuchhek siten hi bachati hai jinpar party maanegi aisa lagata nahin he
 It is believed that Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati are now trying to put pressure on the Congress, sensing the same fate of seats
 donon dal nahin chaahate ki congress ko itnaa bhav diya jaae ki wo gathbandhan main apane liye zyada siton kii maang kar sake
 This is the reason why both leaders have started to shock Rahul Gandhi
 mayawati ne pakad lee alag raahamayawati ne congress ke gathbandhan ke mansoobon par pani pherate hue madhyapradesh main alag se chunaav ladane kaa faisla kar liya he
 This happened when Congress leaders were constantly making statements about an alliance with the BSP and were preparing for elephant rides not just in MP but also in Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan
 beete maah hue karnataka chunaav main bhi vah nateezon se purv congress ke virdohi dal jedies ke saath milakar chunavi samar main utari thim
 The BSP not only won one seat in the state, but for the first time out of UP, the BSP MLA was also given the post of a minister in the congress-jds government
 akhilesh ne bhi band kar lee mutthispa ke rashtriya adhyaksh akhilesh yadav ke kareebi sutron ke mutabik party saal 2019 main hone vaale loksabhaa chunaav main uttar pradesh kii 80 siton main se congress ko sirf do siten hi dena chaahati he
 In this regard, Akhilesh Yadav is reaching Delhi on Tuesday to discuss with other parties of the alliance
 sutron kaa kahana he ki loksabhaa chunaav main samaajawaadee party sirf amethi or raibareli seat hi congress ko dena chaahati he
 The SP does not want to give more than one seat to the Congress
 is babat sapa congress ko prastaav bhi dene kii yojana bana rahi he
 SP sources say that the party wants a triangular contest in UP and is not keen on including Congress in the grand alliance

 Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde told reporters here, "the proposed date from Pakistan is not suitable for us, so the visit of Rahman Malik is postponed
 daure kii nayi tarikhon ke bare main baad main vichaar hoga
 India, however, has cited the winter session of Parliament as the reason behind asking Malik to cancel the visit as Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde is also a Lok Sabha leader and he will be busy
 lekin samajha jaataa he ki mumbai main 2008 ke aatanki hamale main shaamil logon ko dandit karne main pakistan kii vifaltaa asli vajah he
 Sources said the fourth anniversary of the Mumbai attack would fall only three days after Malik's visit to India
 aise main grih mantralay ke adhikariyon ne salaah di ki malik bharat na hi aayen to behatar hai kyonki pakistan mumbai hamale ke aropiyon ko sajaa dene ke maamle main apane vaayadon par khara nahin utraa he

 India has demanded Pakistan to provide voice samples of their mentors instructing the terrorists involved in the Mumbai attack from time to time, but Pakistan has not done anything in this direction so far
 lashkar sansthaapak hafiz said bhi pakistan main aaazaad gum rahaa he
 Sources said that it would not be appropriate for the Pakistan Home Minister to visit India on the fourth anniversary of the Mumbai attack
 pakistan ko rajanyik jariyon se sandesh de diya gaya he
 India has not yet suggested any new date for Malik's visit
 bharat or pakistan ke bich udaar vija samjhauta aath sitambar ko islamabad main hua tha
 The agreement was signed by External Affairs Minister SM Krishna on behalf of India and Malik on behalf of Pakistan

 But Kejriwal again took a U-turn

 unki aam aadmi party is napak gathbandhan se ladane ko taiyaar he

 a senior leader of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) denied that the decision to include brown trousers instead of khaki nikar in the Sangh's uniform was done only to attract the youth to the organization
 
 sangh ke malwa praant (indore or ujjain sambhag) ke pramukh prakaash shastri ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha, "yah bolnaa uchit nahin he ki sangh kii uniform main badlaav keval isaliye kiya gaya, taaki nikar pahanane main jhijak mahasoos karne vaale yuvaaon ko hamaare sanghathan kii ore aakarshith kiya ja sake
 "he said," It is wrong to believe that the inclusion of trousers instead of knickers in the union's uniform will attract the youth towards the union
 sangh kaa kaam nirantar sadhana se judaa he
 Unless the youth assimilate the ideology of the Sangh, they cannot work long with the Sangh
 "tippaniyan Shastri said, "there have been constant changes in the union's uniform over time

 " unhone kaha, "yah maananaa hi galat he ki sangh kii uniform main nikar kii jagah patalun shaamil karne bhar se yuva sangh kii ore aakarshith ho jaayenge
 The work of the Sangh is associated with continuous cultivation
 jab tak yuva sangh kii vichaardhaara ko aatmsaat nahin karenge, tab tak ve sangh ke saath lambe samay tak kaam nahin kar sakate

 Saturday 12 of BJP veteran Arun Jaitley
 07 baje 66 varsh kii aayu main nidhan ho gaya
 He was admitted to AIIMS for a long time
 chaatr jivan se hi raajnneeti main sakriy arun jetali ne desh main apatkaal ke dauraan bhi kaaphi sangharsh kiya tha
 During this time he was kept as a prisoner in Tihar and Ambala Jail
 immergency ke baad jab chunaavon main congress ko buree tarah haar mili thi tab jetali abivipi main kaaphi sakriy bhoomika main the
 Jaitley was given the responsibility of the chairman of Delhi ABVP during that time
 saath hi vah abivipi ke rashtriya sachiv kaa bhi daayitv nibhaa rahe the
 During the Emergency (1975–1977), Arun Jaitley had to spend 19 months in jail under MISA
 rajanarayan or jaiprakash narayan dwaara chalaae gaye bhrashtachar virdohi janandolan main wo pramukh netaaon main se the
 Jai Prakash Narayan appointed him the convener of the National Students and Youth Organization Committee
 itnaa hi nahin, arun jetali naagarik adhikaar andolan main bhi sakriy rahe
 He started the People's Union of Civil Liberties Bulletin with Satish Jha and Smita Kothari
 jail se reeha hone ke baad vah jansangh main shaamil ho gaye
 Arun Jaitley, who comes from a close family of PM Narendra Modi, was one of the closest leaders of Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 bataaya jaataa he ki narendra modi jab gujarat ke mukhyamantri bhi nahin the, tab se arun jetali se unki nazdikiyaan thim
 Sources in the Sangh state that when Modi came to Delhi as a campaigner, he used to stay at Arun Jaitley's residence
 yahi vajah rahi ki modi sarkaar main puraane netaa bhale haashie par chale gaye magar jetali kaa rutaba barkaraar rahaa
 Arun Jaitley has been a member of bjp's national executive since 1991
 1999 ke loksabhaa chunaav se thik pehle unhen bijepi kaa pravaktaa banaaya gaya
 On 13 October 1999, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee appointed him Minister of State (independent Charge) for Information Broadcasting in the NDA government
 iske alaava vaajapeyi ne pehali baar ek nayaa mantralay banaate hue unhen vinievesh rajya mantri (swatantra prabhaar) niyukt kiya
 After the resignation of Ram Jethmalani, Jaitley was also given the additional charge of Minister of Law, Justice and Company Affairs on 23 July 2000
 november 2000 main unhen cabinet mantri kaa darja diya gaya
 Ministry of Shipping was also entrusted with Law, Justice and Company matters
 bhootal parivahan mantralay ke vibhaajan ke baad jahajrani mantralay ke pehle mantri arun jetali hi the
 But in 2002, he resigned from all his posts and became the party's general secretary and national spokesperson
 haalanki, arun jetali phir 29 janvari 2003 ko vaajapeyi sarkaar se jud gaye
 Became Union Minister of justice-law and industry-commerce
 may 2004 main endie ke apratyaashit rup se chunaav haarane ke baad arun jetali waapas bijepi ke mahasachiv bane
 With this, he returned to the practice of law
 rajyasabha main netaa pratipakshrun jetali rajyasabha ke liye chune gaye
 On 3 June 2009, Rajya Sabha Leader of Opposition was elected by Lal Krishna Advani
 iske saath hi unhone bijepi ke mahasachiv pad se istipha de diya, kyonki bijepi ‘ek netaa ek pad’ ke siddhant par kaam karti he
 Apart from this, he was also a member of the Central Election Committee of the party
 1980 se party main rahane ke baavjood jetali ne kabhi chunaav nahin ladaa tha lekin bijepi ne unhen 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi saansad navjot singh siddhu kii jagah par amritsar se maidan main utaara
 But he lost the election against Congress candidate and former Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh
 ol india congress cameti ke adhiveshan main party adhyaksh sonia gandhi ne rahul gandhi ko piem ummidavaar banaae jane ke naam par ho rahi narebaaji par kaha ki party kaa faisla sabko bataa diya gaya he, vahi antim he
 Congress is ready for the coming battle
 sonia ne kaha ki congress main piem ummidavaar banaae jane kii parampara nahin rahi he
 Sonia said that progress can only be achieved through education, so we have enacted the right to education
 dalit, alpsankhyak or garib bacchon ke liye wajife kii vyavastha kii he
 She said that the central government has helped create millions of self-help groups for women in the last few years, which are helping to change the lives of millions of women
 mahilaon ke prati gharelu hinsa or bacchon ke yon utpeedan ko lekar bhi kanoon sakht kiye hai
 He said that a large number of development plans have gone with this new partnership keeping political differences aside
 kya kisi or sarkaar ne itnaa kuch kiya he? hamen yah kehane main koi sankoch nahin hona chahie tamaam mushkilon ke baavjood manmohan singh ne apane lakshyon ko puraa karte hue sarkaar kaa netritv kiya he
 Sonia further said that villages have got employment through MNREGA
 ham aitihaasik khaadya suraksha bill ham lekar aae hai
 Sonia said, the fabric of our country is threatened by communalism
 mukhya vipakshi dal bhaajapa par nishaanaa sadhate hue congress adhyaksh ne kaha ki inkaa mukhya rasta kattarta or dwesh or sampradayikta failaane kaa he, unka rasta hinsa failaane kaa he
 How can such a government be tolerated
 
 
 is tarah kii sampradayik vichaardhaaraon ke khilaaf hamane kabhi samjhauta nahin kiya, sangharsh kiya he
 He said, there is an upheaval in the country
 hamaari nitiyon or kaaryakramon kii safalataa se ek bahut bada madhya varg ubhara he
 Every change in this country has happened because of our party
 hamaari party ne hi apane desh ko krishi, udyog or takanic kaa kendra banaaya he
 Sonia said, we will not sit peacefully until this curse of poverty is completely eradicated from our earth
 hamaari party ke lakhon kaaryakartaaon ne bina kisi swaarth ke party ko shakti di he
 i congratulate all the activists who never give up
 sonia ne kaha, hamane lambey itihaas main anek utaar-chadhaav dekhe hai, haar bhi or jeet bhi, raajnneeti main inase bachaa nahin ja saktaa, lekin hamaari khubi he ki ham hameshaa jeevant rahenge
 We will face the challenges ahead
 isse pehle, adhiveshan se pehle rahul gandhi ko pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar ghoshit karne par party ne guuruuvaar ko sabhi atakalon par viraam lagaate hue saaf kar diya ki party piem pad kaa ummidavaar ghoshit hi nahin karegi, lekin aam chunaavon kii kaman rahul gandhi hi sanbhaalenge
 The biggest challenge for the party is to win the Lok Sabha elections, but given the defeat in the assembly elections, it is being speculated that the path will not be easy for the UPA to return to power for the third time
 rahul gandhi ko party bhale hi pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar ghoshit na kare, lekin yah bhi tay he ki party agar satta main ai, to rahul ko hi kaman milegi
 By handing him the election campaign, the Congress has declared him its biggest leader, but questions are arising whether the Congress is saving Rahul Gandhi compared to Narendra Modi
 
 
 guuruuvaar ko congress kaarysmiti kii baithak ke baad jab party pravaktaa janardan dvivedi media ke saamne aae, to laga ki vah koi bada elaan karne vaale hai
 He said that everyone wanted to see Rahul as the PM candidate in the meeting, but Congress President Sonia Gandhi said that it was not Congress's tradition to announce the Prime Ministerial candidate before the elections
 rahul gandhi ko ek saal pehle jaipur main yojit chintan shivi main party ke upaadhyaksh pad kii jimmedaari saunpi gai thi or ab thik ek saal baad unhen prachaar abhiyaan kii kaman saunpi ja rahi he
 Taking a dig at the BJP for declaring Narendra Modi as its Prime Ministerial candidate, Congress General Secretary Janardan Dwivedi said that no one has ever held the post of Prime Minister from the time of Jawaharlal Nehru in the Congress to the 2004 elections led by Sonia Gandhi
 The question of declaring a candidate of the party has not arisen
 unhone kaha, yah hameshaa se spasht rahaa he ki congress main netaa koun he
 This has never been an issue for us
 unhone iske saath hi kaha ki yah un partiyon ke liye mudda he, jinamein pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar banane ko lekar tagdi pratispardhaa or khinchataan he
 Mumbai's Arthur Road Jail has received a letter regarding Bollywood actor Sanjay Dutt
 is khat main sanjay dutt ko dhamkee di gai he
 After this letter, the jail administration has promised to give a strong guarantee of their safety
 gaur karne vaali baat he ki sanjay dutt ne mangalvaar ko apni jaan ko khatra bataaya tha or tada cart main yachika daayar karke sidhaa pune ke yaravada jail main sarender karne kii maang kii thi
 However, he withdrew his petition on Wednesday
 ab sanjay dutt jail kii jagah tada court main sarender karenge
 Sanju Baba has to surrender by 4 pm on Thursday
 vahiin, dhamkee bhari chitthee milane ke baad sawaal yahi he ki aakhir sanjay dutt ko koun maarna chahta he?yachika jisamen sanjay dutt ne jane ke khatre kii baat kahi thi
 
 
 Sanjay Dutt is afraid to surrender in court
 unke vakeelon ne tada court main ek yachika daayar kar do daleelein di thi
 Argument No
 1 - Sanjay Dutt is feeling threatened by radical forces over his life
 daleel number 2-wo nahin chaahate ki court se jail le jane tak media ke camere unka peechha karte rahen or koi haadasa ho jaae
 The last time when Sanju Baba was arrested, the media followed him
 is vajah se unhen 120 kilometre kii raftaar se gaadi bhagaani padi thi
 Significantly, on March 21, 1993, regarding the 1993 Mumbai blasts, the decision to uphold Sanjay Dutt's sentence under the Arms Act (for possessing weapons illegally) was given
 nyaayalay ne dutt ko 5 saal kaid kii sajaa sunai thi
 He has already been sentenced to 18 months in jail and now he has to serve a further sentence of three and a half years in prison
 is faisle ke baad is bollywood abhinayta ne apni filmon kii shooting khatm karne ke baad aatmasamarpan karne kaa anurodh karte hue supreme court main yachika daayar kii, jiske baad court ne unhen samarpan karne ke liye 4 hafton kii mohalat di thi
 After getting the surrender, Sanjay Dutt filed a review petition in the Supreme Court which was dismissed
 kya he maamla?sanjay dutt ko gaiyrkanoonee tareeke se nau mem kii pistaul or eke 56 rifl rakhane ke jurm main tada adaalat ne doshi tehraaya tha
 These weapons were part of the same explosive material and weapons consignment used in the Mumbai blasts
 in dhamaakon main 257 vyakti maare gayi the or 700 se zyada jakhmi ho gaye the
 The TADA court in Mumbai had sentenced him to 6 years, but the top court had reduced it to 5 years
 jharkhandamen patthalgadi kaa maamla tool pakadta ja rahaa he
 Chief Minister Raghuvar Das has said that illegal cultivation of opium is being done under the guise of Pathalgadi
 in sabko raashtra-virdohi takatein sangrakshan de rahi hai
 Let us know that in the tribal-dominated villages of Khunti and Gumla districts in Jharkhand these days the program of Pathalgadi is happening at a very fast pace
 isamen police yaa prashasnic adhikariyon kaa gaanv main gram sabha kii bina anumati ke pravesh nishedh he
 The shilapat outside the affected village, which is developing the village, has clearly written a warning that entry of any outsider into the village without the permission of the gram sabha is forbidden
 sarkaar kaa aarope he ki darasal patthalgadi kii aad main samaaj virdohi tatv opium kii avaidh kheti main lage hue hai
 At the same time, they are engaged in provoking the tribals and villagers against the country and the state government by resorting to the Pathalgadi
 mukhyamantriraghuvar daska maananaa he ki patthalgadi kii vajah se gaanv kaa vikaas prabhavit ho rahaa he
 However, Raghuvar Das has said that the government will not allow this program being run by anti-national forces in any way
 gauratlab he ki beete kuch dinon se gaanv main chhapemari karne gaye police javaanon ko jabaran bandhak banaae jane kii khabare lagaataar aa rahi hai
 The ancient tribal tradition of Pathalgadi was earlier used by tribals to prevent unwanted people from entering the village, but it has gained momentum over the years
 bataaya jaataa he ki khunti or bandagaanv kshetra main jo patthalgadi ho rahi he, vah sarna samaaj kii patthalgadi se alag he
 In fact, the people of Pathalgadi do not want outsiders to come to their village
 vaise patthalgadi adivasee samaaj kii parampara he
 Under this, the demarcation of the village is done, but now under the guise of this, illegal pilgrimage is being done outside the village
 pathar par gram sabha kaa adhikaar dilaane vaale bhartiya samvidhan ke anuchhedon kii galat vyakhya karte hue graminon ko andolan ke liye uksaaya ja rahaa he
 Congress party candidate Ajay Rai, who is contesting against the Bharatiya Janata Party's Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi in Varanasi, was voting and putting his party symbol on his kurta while queuing up
 is baat kii shikaayat bhaajapa ne chunaav ayog se kii he
 At the same time, after the preliminary inquiry, the Election Commission ordered the registration of the FIR after which the case was registered at the local police station
 is masale ke vivaad main badalane ke baad apni safai main ajay raay ne kaha ki galati se unhone kurte par baij laga liya tha
 He argues that showing the election symbol is wrong
 yah puche jane par ki jis tarah gandhinagar main modi ke maamle main hua tha kya usee tarah yah bhi chunaav aachaar samhita kaa ulanghan nahin he, raay ne kaha ummidavaar ke taur par unhen party kaa chunaav chihn lagane kaa adhikaar he or ‘‘haath kaa chihn unke dil main he
 "he did not show the sign
 vahiin, jila prashasan kaa kahana he ki unhone report chunaav ayog ko bhej di he
 It is being told that the Election Commission has issued a notice to Ajay Rai
 ullekhneey he ki gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi par voting ke baad media waalon ko chunaav chihn dikhaane par chunaav ayog ne exiaar darj karne kaa aadesh diya tha
 It is worth noting that in the Ahmedabad seat, Narendra Modi is only a voter and from this seat the party candidate LK Advani is in the fray
 vahiin, varanasi seat par ajay raay na keval congress party ke ummidavaar hai balki ek voter bhi hai
 Seeking action on Narendra Modi, the Congress party had also demanded the rejection of Narendra Modi's candidature
 ab sabaki nigahen chunaav ayog par hai
 At the same time, the Election Commission has summoned a report on this whole issue
 aamtaur par jab bhi kisi film yaa uske promo se pataa chalata he ki us film main pakistan kii galat chhavi dikhaai di ho sakati he, us film par pakistan main pratibandh laga diya jaataa he or use pakistan main release nahin kiya jaataa
 However, it does not affect the audience
 pakistan ke darshak kisi bhi tarah us film ko dekh lete hai
 The comments pakistan ke abhinayta fawaad khan kehete hai ki 'har vah hindi film pakistani dekh lete hai jise pakistan main release nahin hone di jaati he
 Nowadays, apart from the cinema hall, there are other ways through which the film reaches Pakistan and the audience sees this film
 kareeb kareeb aisi sabhi pratibandhit hindi filmon kii dividi pahunch jaati he"
 Fawad further said, "I will not talk about why the ban is done in Pakistan or i do not know the reason for this but i can say that there is no benefit by banning the release of the film because by some other means Those films enter Pakistan
 aise pratibandh se produsar or distributor kaa nuksaan hota he or isamen donon hi deshon kaa nuksaan he

 Such a ban causes loss to producers and distributors, and both countries have losses

 The current government, which has once referred to the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGA or MGNREGA) as 'a memorial to the failure of the UPA government', has allocated the maximum of Rs 60,000 crore for it in this year's budget
 iske baavjood manaregaa ke tahat kaam karne vaale logon kii mazdooree bahut kam he or isamen saal dar saal badhat bhi oont ke munh main jira jaisi ho rahi he
 There is no significant increase in the election year as well
 On 28 March this year, the Ministry of Rural Development issued a notification for amendment of MGNREGA wages for 34 states and union territories
 lekin kamaal kii baat yah he ki is chunavi saal main bhi jo maamuli badhat kii gai vah chakit karne vaali or niraashajanak hi he
 For example, in six states and union territories, MGNREGA wages were not increased by one rupee (the same wages were retained in 2018)
 inamen goa, karnataka, kerala, pashchim bengal, andaman evam nicobar dweep samooh or lakshadweep shaamil hai
 In two states Himachal Pradesh and Punjab, wages were increased by just Rs 1 as compared to 2018
 isi tarah chhattisgarh or madhya pradesh main mazdooree main mahaj 2 rupee kii badhat kii gai
 Wages were increased from 10 to 17 rupees (which is the maximum) in only 6 states
 ye sabhi purvottar ke rajya hai-arunachal pradesh, manipur, mizoram, nagaland, sikkim or tripura
 At least since 2016 (since the figures are available on the official website), a similar increase is seen in MGNREGA wages
 saal 2018 main 10 rajyon main manaregaa kii mazdooree main ek rupee kii bhi badhat nahin kii gai thi
 These states were Arunachal Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Mizoram, Nagaland, Rajasthan, Sikkim, Tripura, UP and Uttarakhand
 chah rajyon or centre shasit pradeshon main manaregaa kii mazdooree main sirf 2 rupee kii badhat kii gai thi
 These included Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman Diu
 sirf 11 rajyon or centre shasit pradeshon main mazdooree main 8 rupee yaa usase zyada (adhiktam 19 rupee tamilnadu evam pudducheri main) kii badhat kii gai thi
 In the year 2017 too, the wages of MNREGA were increased by just Rs 1 in five states
 inamen assam, bihar, jharkhand, upi or uttarakhand shaamil hai
 Then the wage increase in 11 states and union territories had increased by just Rs 8 or more (maximum increase was Rs 18)
 gramin ilaakon main bad rahi pareshaanigramin ilaakon ke log vaise hi pareshaan hai, unki dikkatein bad rahi hai, lekin manaregaa kii mazdooree ke saath yah majaak kyon ho rahaa he, iske bare main saarvajanik taur par kisi kaa bayaan nahin aayaa he
 According to the Center for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE), since 2015-16, the remuneration of workers in rural areas has increased very little, by a single digit
 gramin kshetra ke log kitne pareshaan hai, iskaa andaja 2018-19 main mazdooron dwaara kiye jane vaale shram ke kaarydiwas main asaadhaaran badhat se bhi lagaaya ja saktaa he
 266 in 2018-19 according to official figures
 4 karod vyakti kaary diwas kaa aankada record hua
 Which is the highest ever since the NDA government came to power
 saal 2014-15 main 166
 21 million people was the working day figure
 nunatam mazdooree se bhi kammanaregaa ke bare main chintaa karne vaali ek baat yah bhi he ki isamen milane vaali mazdooree lagaatar rajyon main tay nunatam mazdooree se bhi kam rahati he
 An analysis by several ngos for the MGNREGA Conflict Committee showed that wages under the MGNREGA in 33 states and union territories are less than the minimum wages fixed in that state
 yah haal tab he jab 1983 main sanjit roy banaam rajasthan maamle main supreme court saaf taur par yah aadesh de chukaa he ki is tarah kii sabhi yojanaon main milane vaali paarishramik tay nunatam mazdooree se kam nahin honi chahie
 For the last four years, many social workers have been struggling to implement the minimum wage fixed under MNREGA, but their struggle has not yielded any result so far

 congress ke varisht netaa pi
 Chidambaram has said that Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi should try to be more assertive and boost the morale of the party workers
 chidambaram ne kaha ki aisa ‘timeteble’ amal main laana chahie, jo party ko aise samay main sachche vipaksh kii bhoomika nibhaane ke liye sakasham banaae, jab party kaaryakartaaon kaa manobal kaaphi gira hua he
 Chidambaram also said that the big task of restructuring the party is pending to present an effective, strong and strong opposition to the government
 unhone kaha ki congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi sanghathan main nambar ek hai
 He also said that the decision to make Rahul Gandhi vice-president in Jaipur in January 2013 was probably the right decision
 party ke ek dhade main priyanka gandhi ke liye uth rahi maang se sambandhit sawaalon par chidambaram ne congress adhyaksh or upaadhyaksh se or zyada mukhar hone kaa anurodh kiya
 He said, 'I will request him to address more rallies, request him to meet the media
 ’ek intervyuu main chidambaram ne kaha, ‘main sahamat hum ki congress kaaryakartaaon kaa manobal kaaphi neeche he
 But i do not agree that morale cannot be raised, direction cannot be given
 mujhe yakeen he ki congress netritv ke paas ek time teble he
 Asked if a non-gandhi Congress president could be made, Chidambaram said, "I think so, someday
" ' jab yah poocha gaya ki is tarah kii sthiti kab aegi, to unhone turant kaha, ‘mujhe pataa nahin he
 Chidambaram's remarks came at a time when the election process is going on in the organization, which will lead to the election of a new party president by the end of July next year
 sonia gandhi 1998 se congress adhyaksh hai
 On the question as to why the Akhir Party is so much dependent on one family to lead, he said, 'this is because he (rahul Gandhi) belongs to that family, but that does not mean that other young leaders emerge
 Can not aakhirkaar sachin payalat ubhare hai
 The former finance minister denied that the party leadership was not even talking to party workers
 unhone kaha, ‘yah sahi nahin he
 i meet him at regular intervals
 ve hamase baatcheet karte hai or main aisa maanata hum ki or bhi aise hai
 i would request them to talk to the public
 'yah puche jane par ki kya vah is tathy se niraash hai ki sonia ne apana sthaan chhod diya or ise apane putr ke liye chhod diya, chidambaram ne kaha ki yah sawaal unheen se poocha janaa chahie
 But i think that the creation of the post of Vice President and the appointment of Rahul Gandhi to this post was a well thought out strategy to command the next generation of leadership
 chidambaram ne kaha, 'yah har str par ho rahaa he or main nahin samajhataa ki isamen koi galati he
 i think that the decision of Jaipur was probably the right decision, which was enthusiastically welcomed not only inside the party but also from outside the party
 'netritv ke mudde par unhone kaha, ‘meri peedi kii ati sweekaarya netaa sonia gandhi hai or main samajhataa hum ki party ke yuva sadasyon ke bich rahul gandhi kii vyapak sweekaaryata he
 This does not mean that other leaders cannot or should not emerge
 ’congress netaa ne vitt mantri arun jetali kii us tippanee ko bhi khaarij kiya ki kalaadhan rakhane vaale khataadhariyon ke naam kaa khulaasa hone se congress ko sharminda hona pad saktaa he
 Chidambaram said, "this is a personal transaction, a personal violation of the law
" vyakti ko sharminda hona chahie
 Why should the party be ashamed
 mujhe nahin pataa lekin agar kisi mantri kaa naam he, to yah unako sharminda karegaa

 Bihar has the same flood situation as in 2008
 ek baar phir rajya ke badhgrast ilaakon kii madad ke liye vahi paanch karod kaa gujarat kaa check prastaavit he
 There is the same BJP government in Gujarat
 bihar ke satta ke singhaasana par baithe vahi siem nitish kumaar hai, jinhone us samay madad ko thukraa diya tha, lekin is baar paanch karod lautaane ke mood main nahin dikh rahe
 To help the flood-affected areas of Bihar, the Chief Minister of Gujarat, Vijay Rupani, Revenue Minister Bhupendra C
 Chudasama will give a check of Rs 5 crore to Bihar CM Nitish Kumar in Patna
 is maukey par bihar ke upmukhyamantri susheel kumaar modi bhi maujuud rahenge
 This Rs 5 crore will go to the Chief Minister's Relief Fund to help flood victims in Bihar
 bihar main is saal baadh se baari tabaahi hui he
 Time changed and if the situation changed, the filth in the hearts also disappeared
 piemanarendra modi se nitish kumaarane sari siyaasi adaavat bhuulaakar dost ban chuke hai
 Nitish Kumar again sits on the power of Bihar with the support of BJP
 aise main vah kaise gujarat kii madad ko lautaaen
 Whereas there was a time when Nitish Kumar started avoiding Narendra Modi's shadow
 is chakkar main unhone modi ne madad ke liye haath badhaayaa to use bhi sweekaar nahin kiya
 In 2008, due to the breakdown of the Kosi river dam in Bihar, there was heavy destruction in the Kosi area
 aise main gujarat sarkaar ne 2008 main 5 karod kii madad bheji thi
 At that time Narendra Modi was the Chief Minister of Gujarat
 lekin 2010 main bijepi kii rashtriya kaaryakarini kii baithak patna main ho rahi thi
 At the same time, some enthusiastic BJP workers had put up posters in Patna that Gujarat had helped Bihar with 5 crores
 isse naaraaz mukhyamantri ne gujarat ke paise lautaa die the or bijepi netaaon ke sammaan main mukhyamantri awaas main hone vaale bhoj ko bhi radd kar diya tha
 Bihar again stands on the same situation of 2008
 baadh ke vahi halaat hai or madad ke liye vahi gujarat sarkaar kii ore se paanch karod rupee kaa check saamne aayaa he
 In such a situation, once again with this help of Gujarat, politics has started to light up
 nitish kumaar ne haal hi bihar main bijepi ke saath milakar sarkaar banaai he or uske baad wo ab endie main bhi ek baar phir shaamil ho gaye hai
 After 2008, Gujarat is getting help in 2017, although there was no major flood during this period
 yahi vajah he ki bihar ke upmukhyamantri susheel kumaar modi kehete hai ki puraani baton ko yaad karne se koi phayda nahin he
 He said that in view of the terrible floods in Bihar this year, many states have given help
 keval gujarat hi nahin madhyapradesh, jharkhand or uttar pradesh jaise rajya madad kar rahe hai

 BJP leader Smriti Irani is as much discussed in the Amethi seat of UP as in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 yah seat congress kaa garh rahi he or is seat se congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi(rahul Gandhi) ke khilaaf smriti irani chunaav lard rahi hai
 The BJP has played this stance only to contest Rahul as Smriti gave a tough fight in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections too
 amethi ko shuruyaat se hi gandhi parivaar ke prabhaav vaali seat mana jaataa he lekin is baar bijepi puri koshish kar rahi he ki vah is seat par apana kuch prabhaav jamaa sake isliye usne jujharu netaa kii chhavi vaali smriti irani ko chunaav main khadaa kiya he
 However, in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Smriti lost to Rahul by nearly one lakh votes
 isse pehle 2004 main smriti irani congress ke senior netaa kapil sibbal ke khilaaf dilli ke chandani chowk se chunaav lard chuki hai
 Smriti was born on 23 March 1976 in Delhi
 unke pita punjabi or maa bengali thim
 Smriti was the eldest of three sisters, so she started working when she was in the tenth class
 ek beauty product ke pramotion ke liye unhen ek din ke 200 rupye milte the
 Smriti first came into the limelight when she participated in the Miss India competition, which was held in 1998
 haalanki vah isamen safal nahin ho pain lekin isse unhen pahchaan jarur mili
 Smriti then moved to Mumbai where she initially worked at mcdonald's to earn money
 2001 main vah parsi vyapaaree jubin irani ke saath shaadi ke bandhan main bandha gayi
 Irani's professional life changed when she got Ekta Kapoor's serial
 is serial kaa naam tha 'kyonki saas bhi kabhi bahu thi
 In this serial, Smriti played the role of Tulsi, which became very popular in every household
 is serial ne smriti ko khub pahchaan dilaai
 In 2003, she left acting and joined politics
 ab unhen raajnneeti main aae hue kareeb dedh dashak biit chukaa he
 In 2004, she became the vice president of the youth wing of BJP Maharashtra
 2004 main hi unhone dilli ke chandani chowk se congress ke senior netaa kapil sibbal ke khilaaf chunaav ladaa
 Although she lost this election
 phir unhen bijepi kii kendriya samiti kaa agxcutive member banaaya gaya or 2010 main vah party kii rashtriya sachiv or mahila wing kii adhyaksh banaai gayi
 In 2011, Smriti was made a member of the Rajya Sabha
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main unke naam kii charchaa isliye bhi tej ho gai kyonki unhone amethi main rahul gandhi ke khilaaf loksabhaa chunaav ladaa
 During this time she gave a tough fight to Rahul but she lost by one lakh votes
 rahul ke khilaaf chunaav haarane ke baavjood 2014 main unhen centre main maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantralay diya gaya, haalanki baad main unhen kendriya kapadaa mantri banaaya gaya
 In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, she is once again giving a tough fight to Congress President Rahul Gandhi in Amethi
 chuttee se lautne ke baad modi sarkaar ko har morche par gherne kii koshish kar rahecongress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhiko ab apane sansadeey kshetra kii bhi yaad aane lagi he
 On Thursday, Rahul Gandhi raised the issue of Amethi Mega Food Park in Lok Sabha
 loksabhaa main congress upaadhyaksh ne kaha ki piem modi ne kisaanon se kiya huawada todaahai
 Modi always claims to work in the interest of farmers, but the opposite is true in Amethi
 unhone kaha ki food park kisaanon ke haq kii ladaai thi, lekin sarkaar ne use nazarandaaj kiya
 Rahul alleged that PM Modi is doing politics of revenge
 kisaanon se 2 rupye main aalu kharidkar use 10 rupye main bechaa jaataa he
 Which is an injustice to them
 vahiin, rahul gandhi ke aaropon par grahamantri rajnath singh ne kaha ki vah vyaktigat taur par is maamle kii padtaal karenge or jawaab denge
 The government is working in the interest of farmers
 unhone jawaab dete hue rahul par nishaanaa saadhaa or kaha ki rahul ko kheti kaa samaj nahin he
 As soon as coming to power, the government had imposed a ban on the Mega Food Park project started in Amethi in July 2014

 jahir ko diya apni kamyaabi kaa shreyishanth ke mutabik vah aaj jo bhi hai jahir kii badaulat hai kyonki jahir ne unhen ek acha gendbaaj banane main kaaphi sahyog kiya or maargdarshan diya

 President Pranab Mukherjee on Tuesday approved the ordinance for e-auctioning of coal blocks to private companies

 The Supreme Court in a judgment last month has canceled the allocation of 214 coal mines allotted after 1993

 "but it was in New York 10 years ago
" bharat main, lakshanik taur par kahen to, varjanaayen itani sakht hai ki sex ke liye paise ke bhugtan se afat aa sakati he
 However, in the absence of a work-free environment in our country, paid sex work remains an easy way to gain taboo pleasure

 One of the reasons for this was that Playboy was not covered in plastic jackets in those days, so you could watch the pages in reverse until your parents bought groceries

 One-quarter of male respondents in this country approve of sex with prostitutes, and 20 percent admit to having sex with them
 jaahir he, ek aise desh main, jahaan sex aasaani se uplabdh nahin he, use paise se khareednaa aasaan dikhataa he
 This is more evident in so-called traditionalist cities
 chennai ke 30 pratishat, ludhiana ke 33 pratishat, ahmedabad ke 25 pratishat or hyderabad ke 22 pratishat purushon ne dilli, kolkata yaa mumbai ke purushon kii tulana main veshyaaon ke saath adhik younachaar kiya he
 Interestingly, it is very easy to access prostitutes in Delhi, Kolkata or Mumbai
 jaahir he, paisa har samasya kaa samaadhaan he
 At least 15 percent of respondents claim they paid whenever they had sex
 pornography saamaajik gatividhi kaa ang ban gai he!beshak aaj bhugtan ke evaj main sex sweekaarya hota ja rahaa he, chaahe vah vaastavik ho yaa kaalpanik
 For example, pornography seems to have taken the nation into its grip
 lagbhag 62 pratishat bhartiya purush pornography pasand karte hai
 Surprisingly, 73 percent of Indians have seen it despite not liking pornography
 aisa lagata he ki pornography saamaajik gatividhi kaa ang ban gai he
 For example, 40 percent of people watch it with their partner and 47 percent with their friends
 jaahir he, jode jo kaam ek saath karte hai unamem pornography bhi dekhnaa shaamil he
 However, half the country watches pornography, and very few people saw it before when they were teenagers
 lihaaja, yah anumaan sahaj hi lagaaya ja saktaa he ki kaamuk chitra vagairah ab sweekaarya ho gaye hai
 Many people consider condom use to be useless as far as actual sex work is concerned, if the trend of acquiring sex with money is decreasing in the metros, is it because the men there have reduced their libido and they are watching pornography Can you afford it, not sex? no at all
 darasal, isse bhi bada anand unka intjaar kar rahaa he
 For example, Mumbai has an abundance of foreign prostitutes and 27 per cent of the people of the city have visited them
 kanoon isamen koi baadhak nahin banataa
 Hence, it has also become a 'safe way' of sexual activity
 videshi veshyaayein aids or younachaar se hone vaali bimariyon se waakif hai, isliye ve use swasth, aanandadaayak banane ke liye puri saavdhaanee baratati hai or bina condom main yonkriya main bhaag nahin letin
 On the other hand, many people consider condom use to be useless
 purush veshya adhik kamai kar rahe hambaharhaal, bharat kaa veshyavriti udyog khub chal rahaa he jiskaa salanaa kaarobaar 2,000 karod ru
 Is told of
 ek bada rahasyodghatan yah bhi he ki mahila kii tulana main purush veshya adhik kamai kar rahe hai
 The number of women in the metros is increasing day by day who hire or approve male prostitutes
 aisi mahilaayein mumbai main 17 pratishat, dilli main 15 pratishat, kolkata main 13 pratishat pai gayi
 Foreign male prostitutes (jigolo) are in great demand in Bangalore
 vahaan inhen kiraye par lene vaali 62 pratishat mahilaayein videshiyon ko pasand karti hai
 The reason for this is that 40 percent of India's migrant population lives here and some working women can find themselves very lonely here
 aapke paas paisa he to aapke paas takat helekin jahaan desh kii mahilaayein or purush sex kharid rahe hai, vahiin is kshetra main kanuunan abhi bhi kai khamiyaan hai
 The ITPA categorizes neither sex work nor sex workers as a crime, but considers sex in a 'public place' illegal
 bharat ke sex workaron kii union is adhinium kaa lambey samay se virodh kar rahi he kyonki police unhen pareshaan karti he
 The proposed amendment of the Act in 2005 is being opposed even more
 is sanshodhan main, sex varkar kii jagah graahak ko giraftaar karne or teen saal ke karawas kii sajaa dene kaa praavdhaan he
 But a simple argument could be that if sex is available in many forms in lieu of money, then why ban such sex? Whatever the law, prostitution does not appear to be curbed by law, it starts selling in a new cover
 yadi sex workaron ke saath yonkriya karne se aap sikhchon ke peeche pahunch sakate hai to aap internet par pornography dekhne kaa surakshit rasta apana sakate hai
 But if there is no option to get sex in lieu of money, then consider other options
 phone uthaaie yaa jacket main lipati ashleel patrika uthaaie
 Or quietly go to the local video parlor
 yadi aapke paas paisa he to aapke paas takat he

 ’ The truth of match fixing and spot fixing of IPL has been exposed
 jis daaud ibrahim ke hukum se ipel main sattebaaji kii taraf dilli police ishaara kar rahi thi, us daaud kii ek phone kol se ek mantriji kaa naam saamne aa rahaa he
 The question is who is that betting minister of Dawood
 20 saal se faraar india ke most wanted daaud ibrahim ke khilaaf do bade or pukhta saboot bhartiya agenciyon ke haath lage hai
 For the first time, this evidence is going to testify how the entire IPL spot-fixing game was carried out under the command of Dawood Ibrahim, the underworld don sitting in Pakistan
 duniya ke sabase khatarnaak mujarimon main se ek daaud ibrahim kii aawaaj ko hindustan kii police ne kaid kar liya he
 At the same time, the disclosure of Dawood has shaken the rule of India
 160 second kii record kii gai phone kol main daaud ibrahim ek ministar kaa zikr kar rahaa he
 The minister, whom Dawood Ibrahim himself mentions in conversation with his syndicate's bookie and Dubai's businessman Dr
 Javed Chutani
 daaud ibrahim us ministar se baat karaane ke liye javed chutani ko bharosa dilaataa he
 Apparently these conversations were to be held through conference
 jis spot phixing ke khel ne hindustan ke cricket main hadakamp machaa diya tha, usamen anderworld or khud daaud ke haath hone kaa daawa to dilli police ne to pehle din hi kiya tha- taal thonkkar
 Underworld don Dawood Ibrahim called one of his bookies from Karachi to Dubai before IPL-6 started
 usee phone main ek mantri se deal kii baat saamne ai he
 In India, IPL Commissioner Rajiv Shukla and his team were preparing to start a colorful program of cricket, while Dawood Ibrahim, sitting in Karachi, was engaged in the second preparation of IPL
 ye taiyaari thi ipel ke sijan-6 main spot phixing karaane kii badi sajeesh karaane kii, jiske liye di company hi nahin, khud daaud ibrahim cricket ke buki or dubai ke bijnesaman dow javed chutani ke saath phone par active ho chukaa tha
 On March 26, 2013, about ten days before the IPL, Dawood Ibrahim called Dr
 Javed Chutani in Dubai from Karachi with his phone number 92 xxrep 4 3 2064xxx
 bhartiya samay ke mutabik tab raat ke saadhe nau baj rahe the
 Due to the busy traffic of Karachi and Dubai, this call diverted from Hindustan to Dubai
 sutron ke mutabik daaud ibrahim kaa number 92 xxrep 4 3 2064xxx bhartiya agenciyon ke radar par tha or daaud kii 160 second kii ye baatcheet record ho gai
 Dawood is the underworld kingpin
 ye duniya jaanati he
 So it is not surprising that Don talks about illegal deals worth millions of crores
 lekin is baatcheet kii aakhir main jab baat ek ministar kii ho rahi he, to ye baat chaunkaane se zyada daraane vaali he
 Now the question arises - Who is that minister? - Which minister is associated with Dawood's wire? - Dawood is talking about dealing with which minister? - Which minister is involved in spot fixing of cricket? The matter of fixing was suppressed? Dawood's voice came after twenty years, but more than that, the question has come to know who the minister is
 or kahin aisa to nahin ki us mantriji kaa naam aane se hi spot phixing kaa puraa maamla dabaa diya gaya

 anna hazaare guuruuvaar ko congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi se mulaakaat ke dauraan pradhanmantri pad ko lokapal ke daayre main laane ke mudde par unhen manaane kii koshish karenge
 Hazare will ask Sonia that when an honest person like Manmohan Singh has no personal hesitation to bring the post of Prime Minister to the Lokpal, then what is the problem in doing so? hazaare paksh ne yah bhi kaha he ki singh ko pradhanmantri pad ko lokapal ke daayre main laane ke bare main usee tarah se apni patibaddhta darshani chaiye, jaisi unhone america ke saath parmaanu qaraar karne ke mudde par dikhaayi thi
 Hazare, who arrived in Delhi on Wednesday, said that he would meet Sonia on Thursday and make her aware of her stand on the Lokpal Bill
 kai netaaon se mulaakaat karne rashtriya rajdhani aaye hazaare ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ‘ham sabhi dalon ke saath baithak karne vaale hai
 We will also meet Sonia Gandhi and tell her that if the Prime Minister himself is saying this (talk of not being hesitant to bring his office under the purview of Lokpal) then what is the problem? ’ unhone kaha ki maujuuda pradhanmantri eemaandaar vyakti hai
 Hazare said, 'the Union Cabinet belongs to India, the people in the cabinet are our people
 to phir faisla karne main samasya kya he
 They should take such a decision for the country
 ’ hazaare kii yah tippanee aise samay aayi he jab singh ne paanch varisht sampadakon ke saath baatcheet ke dauraan kaha he ki pradhanmantri pad ko lokapal ke daayre main laane ke bare main unhen swayan koi jhijak nahin he, lekin unke mantrimandal ke kai sahyogiyon kaa maananaa he ki aisa karne se asthirataa paidaa ho sakati he
 Hazare's fellow activist Kiran Bedi said that the Prime Minister should listen to his conscience and take a personal decision and adopt the same approach as he had adopted on the nuclear deal issue
 pradhanmantri ne kaha he ki vah lokapal ke mudde par rasta nikaalane or us par rashtriya aamasahmati banane kii koshish karenge
 He said that the government will contact the members of the society (hazare Paksha) in this context, but no group can impose their final say on everything
 is par kiran ne kaha ki har najariya tarksangat hona chaiye
 This is the reason why the Hazare side is constantly demanding to hold public discussion and in this regard, the Central ministers have also been requested
 unhone kaha ki lokapal ke mudde par janata kaa najariya khabaron, surveykshanon or adhyayanon ke jariye khulkar saamne aa rahaa he
 You cannot ignore this
 purv ipies adhikari ne yah bhi kaha ki pradhanmantri ko lokapal ke daayre main laane ke bare main raajnneetik dalon ke vichaar alag-alag hai
 She said that now it will be decided in the Parliament, but she does not know how much attention will be taken of the demands of the people
 kiran ne kaha ki hazaare paksh yah bhi peshkash rakh chukaa he ki nyaayik javabdehi vidheyak kaa masauda phir se taiyaar kiya jaye, kyonki maujuuda masauda majboot nahin he

 aavedan karne kii aakhri taarikh-26 farvari 2018 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has raised a serious question about Rajya Sabha
 bajet satr kii samaapti par unhone patrakaron se kaha ki main yah samaj saktaa hum ki do sadanon kii vyavastha main kabhi-kabhaar apratyaksh rup se nirvaachit sadan pratyaksh se chune gaye sadan ke vivek par sawaal uthaa saktaa he
 This may be occasional, but cannot be session by session, not bill by bill
 sansadeey loktantr main yah ek gambhir sawaal he ki kya bill dar bill nirvaachit sadan ke faisale ko apratyaksh rup se nirvaachit sadan chunauti de saktaa he
 i am not surprised at Jaitley's question
 samvidhan sabha main bhi is masale par khub bahes ho chuki he, lekin pehle unki bechaini ko samajhnaa chahie
 From the beginning, the Modi government has been underlining that there is no majority in Rajya Sabha
 haal hi main grahamantri rajnath singh ne kaha ki rajyasabha main bahumat nahin he isliye ram mandir ke liye kanoon nahin bana sakate
 bjp's line is that in the Ram temple case, the decision of the court will be final
 achaanak ram mandir ke rajyasabha main bahumat kii baat kahaan se aa gai
 By the way, if the government wants, like the Land Acquisition Bill, for the Ram Mandir, it can also call a joint meeting of the Rajya Sabha and the Lok Sabha and pass any unknown Bill related to the Ram Mandir

 Are they talking about limiting the role of Rajya Sabha
 phir ve sidhe kyon nahin kehete ki rajyasabha hi nahin hona chahie, jiske ve sadsy hai
 The reason for the debate in the Constituent Assembly was that there should not be a second chamber, this would slow down the pace of legislation

 What should its members do? kya ve khud aise sadan kaa sadsy hona chahenge, jisaki koi sakriy bhoomika na ho
 Do they believe that while in opposition, they raised unnecessary questions on the discretion of the Lok Sabha in the Rajya Sabha
 kya ve merit par sawaal karte the yaa loksabhaa ke faislon ko raajnneetik kaarnon se roka karte the

 ek taraf jahaan pradhanmantri sanghavaad kii vakaalat karte rahete hai duusari taraf unke vittamantri rajyon kii pratinidhi sanstha rajyasabha par sawaal kar rahe hai
 Arun Jaitley has raised a serious issue
 par unase kuch sawaal puche jane chahie
 What does he mean by the occasional waiver of questioning the discretion of the Lok Sabha
 kya ve rajyasabha kii bhoomika ko simit karne kii baat kar rahe hai
 Then why don't they directly say that there should be no Rajya Sabha of which they are members
 samvidhan sabha main jo bahes hui uskaa mul hi tha ki second chember nahin hona chahie isse kanoon banane kii gati dhimi hogi
 If Jaitley says that session by session or bill by bill, do not question the discretion of the Rajya Sabha, what should he do
 uske sadsy kya karen
 Would he like to be a member of a House that has no active role? kya ve maanate hai ki vipaksh main rahete hue unhone rajyasabha main loksabhaa ke vivek par bevajaah sawaal khadey kiye
 Did he question merit or block the decisions of the Lok Sabha for political reasons
 yahi raay agar ek saal pehle upie ke kisi netaa ne kahi hoti to bijepi yaa jetali kii kya raay hoti
 Would he have been involved in this serious debate, or would have called the government then anti-constitution, anti-democracy
 yah sahi he ki ucch sadan bhi ab nimna sadan yani loksabhaa kii tarah raajnneetik kaarnon se kaam karne laga he
 The scale of discretion is also a political reason
 par is sthiti main laane main to sabaki baraabar bhoomika he
 Sixty-year-old argument will not work here
 rajyasabha gargian kii bhoomika nahin nibhaa rahi he
 If Jaitley wants to debate about the abolition of the Rajya Sabha or the Legislative Councils in the states, they want to reach a decision, then they can get a lot of support from the debate in the Constituent Assembly, but they should tell that the Rajya Sabha in which they themselves are many They have been opposing the laws, why is the patient responding in the same house when their law is opposed
 rajyasabha rajyon kii pratinidhi sanstha he
 The Council of Ministers is not responsible to the Rajya Sabha
 agar rajyasabha main sarkaar kaa bahumat nahin he tab sarkaar par sadan kaa niyantran zarur ho jaataa he
 It seems that Arun Jaitley is feeling the same
 phir bhi paryaapt praavdhaan hai ki agar donon sadanon main takaraav kii naubat aa gai to sanyukt adhiveshan bulaayaa ja saktaa he
 This has happened three times, but nowhere in the constitution is it written that this cannot happen ten times
 ab aate hai samvidhan sabha main second chember yani rajyasabha yaa vidhaan parishad ko lekar hui bahes par
 But one must be careful
 aksar netaa apane hisaab se samvidhan sabha kii bahes kii asahmati or sahmati kaa hawala de dete hai
 You cannot put the disagreement raised during the debate over the verdict because that verdict is done by vote or consensus
 kai rajaneta aisa karte hai par zimmedaar naagarik ko aisa nahin karnaa chahie
 6 January 1949 was also a Thursday and 13 May 2015 was also a Thursday when Arun Jaitley questioned the discretion of the Rajya Sabha
 internet kii duniya main aise sanyogon kii khub puch hoti he isliye likh diya varna iskaa bahes se koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 The question before the Constituent Assembly was whether the states should have a Legislative Council
 pashchim bengal kii renuka re vidhaan parishad or dohare sadan kii avadharana ke hi khilaaf thim
 He said that if the Upper House has to test whether the law is made in haste, then the Governor and the President have enough power to urge the House to reconsider the bill
 duusare sadan se kanoon banane kii gati dhimi ho jaaegi jabaki bharat ko aarthik or saamaajik kshetra main tezi se kanoon banane kii zarurat he
 Therefore, we should still decide that the Constitution does not have a system of the second house
 isse koi laabh nahin he
 Another member OV Algesan protests that Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel has also submitted the report of the Provincial Constitution Committee, saying that there should be only one house
 meraa to maananaa he ki yah kuch or nahin balki netaaon ke liye vriddhavastha pension he
 It is a strange coincidence that the opinion was in 1949, the same opinion is heard even today
 rajya sabha to ritair log hi jate hai
 But how can we assume that Arun Jaitley is a retired politician who is there for pension! is bahes ke jawaab main doctor bi aar ambedkar kehete hai ki second chember ke paksh main meri koi thos raay nahin he

 Ambedkar cites a statement by Abe Saye that if the upper house agrees with the lower house (lok Sabha) then it is meaningless but if it is not agreed then it is useless
 aap pathak is chutki ko samaj gaye honge
 But Dr
 Ambedkar says that the French Constituent Assembly never accepted this opinion
 vahaan bhi second chember he
 It is of course that the constitution has the provision of second chamber but as an experiment
 isiilie hamane samvidhan ke masaude main second chember ko sthaayee nahin mana he
 Provision has also been given to abolish it
 philhal samjhaute ke taur par ise samvidhan main sweekaar kar liya janaa chahie
 The comments agar ham samvidhan sabha kii bahason kaa yahaan vahaan se zikr karne kii jaldbaazi ne karen to is par vichaar karnaa chahie ki rajya sabha kii bhoomika par sawaal kyon uthaaya gaya
 Many governments have worked without majority in the Lok Sabha
 bahumat na hone kaa ronaa bhi royaa he, lekin kisi ne nahin kaha ki bahumat bhale na ho magar jo sarkaar main he unke vivek par sadan ko kabhi-kabhaar hi sawaal karnaa chahie
 Should not be done session by session
 yah bhi kahaan likhaa he ki loksabhaa kaa vivek hi antim he yaa hona chahie
 There can also be a conflict with the judiciary over the law
 phir chunaav ke baad janata apane vivek ko loksabhaa ke bharose chhod degi
 It is not clear how Jaitley evaluates the Rajya Sabha
 kya unhen bahumat kaa ekadhikaar chahie yaa phir ve asahmatiyon ko jagah na dene kii vakaalat kar rahe hai
 While the Prime Minister continues to advocate federalism, on the other hand, his Finance Minister is questioning the Rajya Sabha, the representative body of the states
 agar jetali yah kehete hai ki satr dar satr yaa bill dar bill rajyasabha loksabhaa ke vivek par sawaal na karen to vah kya karen
 What should its members do? kya ve khud aise sadan kaa sadsy hona chahenge, jisaki koi sakriy bhoomika na ho
 Do they believe that while in opposition, they raised unnecessary questions on the discretion of the Lok Sabha in the Rajya Sabha
 kya ve merit par sawaal karte the yaa loksabhaa ke faislon ko raajnneetik kaarnon se roka karte the
 If a UPA leader had said the same opinion a year ago, what would have been the opinion of BJP or Jaitley
 kya ve is gambhir bahes main shaamil hote yaa tab kii sarkaar ko samvidhan virdohi, loktantr virdohi tehraate
 It is true that the upper house has also started functioning due to political reasons like the lower house i

 The Rajya Sabha is not playing the role of Guardian
 agar jetali rajyasabha yaa rajyon main vidhaan parishadon kii samaapti ko lekar bahes hi karnaa chaahate hai, kisi faisle par pahunchnaa chaahate hai to samvidhan sabha kii bahes se unhen kaaphi kuch sahaara mil saktaa he, lekin unhen bataanaa to chahie ki jis rajyasabha main ve khud kai kanoonon kaa virodh karte rahe hai usee sadan main unke kanoon kaa virodh hone par dhiraj kyon jawaab de rahaa he
 The Rajya Sabha is the representative body of the states

 If the government does not have a majority in the Rajya Sabha, then the control of the house becomes certain over the government

 aisa teen baar ho chukaa he, lekin samvidhan main kahin nahin likhaa he ki yah das baar nahin ho saktaa he
 Now come to the debate in the Constituent Assembly on the Second Chamber ie Rajya Sabha or Legislative Council

 Often, leaders cite disagreement and consensus in the Constituent Assembly debate

 samvidhan sabha ke saamne sawaal tha ki kya rajyon main vidhaan parishad honi chahie
 Renuka Ray of West Bengal was against the Legislative Council and the concept of a double house

 The pace of legislating from the second house will slow down, while India needs to make laws faster in the economic and social sphere

 That is why we have not considered the Second Chamber permanent in the draft Constitution

 As of now, it should be accepted in the Constitution as an agreement

 internet kii duniya main aise sanyogon kii khub puch hoti he isliye likh diya varna iskaa bahes se koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 The question before the Constituent Assembly was whether the states should have a Legislative Council
 pashchim bengal kii renuka re vidhaan parishad or dohare sadan kii avadharana ke hi khilaaf thim
 He said that if the Upper House has to test whether the law is made in haste, then the Governor and the President have enough power to urge the House to reconsider the bill
 duusare sadan se kanoon banane kii gati dhimi ho jaaegi jabaki bharat ko aarthik or saamaajik kshetra main tezi se kanoon banane kii zarurat he
 Therefore, we should still decide that the Constitution does not have a system of the second house
 isse koi laabh nahin he
 Another member OV Algesan protests that Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel has also submitted the report of the Provincial Constitution Committee, saying that there should be only one house
 meraa to maananaa he ki yah kuch or nahin balki netaaon ke liye vriddhavastha pension he
 It is a strange coincidence that the opinion was in 1949, the same opinion is heard even today
