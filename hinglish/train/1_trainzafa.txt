 Why just chicken and eggs? Mutton and Beef should be added to the list too
 Vedic sacrifices and havans always had offerings of them
 Even horse meat was offered
 # ashwamedhyagya Besides they all eat plants and seeds, which are vegetarian without a doubt
 Yahi baaki reh Gaya ta abbut here's the question: Can these newly vegetarain foods be cooked with # onion and # garlic? Or would that be a step too far

 The Shiv Sena leader said that few people came to him a few days before Chaudhary Charan Singh Agriculture University in Haryana

 Raut said that when asked what is this Ayurvedic egg? So he told that in the poultry farm built in his institute, hen is fed only Ayurvedic food
 usase jo anda paidaa hota he, vah puri tarah se shaakaahaari hota he
 It is an Ayurvedic egg
 jinhen protein kii jarurat he, or jo maansaahaar nahin karnaa chaahate, ve bhi ise kha sakate hai
 Raut said that it is the responsibility of the Ministry of AYUSH, that you have to prove that this egg is vegetarian or non-vegetarian

 Sanjay Raut said that Prime Minister Modi ji has become the biggest ambassador of our Ayurveda and Yoga in the world
 puure vishwa main yoga he, puure vishwa main ayurveda he, to aayush mantralay kaa 1500 karod rupee ke bajaay kam se kam 10 hajaar karod rupee kaa bajet hona chahie
 Praising Ayurveda, Raut said that you know when we knock on the door of Ayurveda? When all the doors are closed

 Salman Khan's lawyer Mahesh Bora, who is jailed in the black deer hunting case, has argued in the sessions court that Salman Khan is innocent
 unhen jhuthe cese main fansaaya gaya he

 Salman honored the court- Mahesh Borasalman Khan's lawyer said that he has never disobeyed the court in the last 20 years
 unhone court kaa hameshaa sammaan kiya he
 They should get bail
 salmaan kaa gunaah bada- bishnoi samaaj ke vakilbishnoi samaaj kewakil ne daleel di salmaan khan ko bel nahin milani chahie
 There is strong evidence against him

 The crime of Salman is big
 chashmadid ne sabakuch dekha
 While Salman Khan's lawyer argued that Salman Khan is acquitted in the Arms Act case, the lawyer of Bishnoi society said that this case is different from the Arms Act

 rahul gandhi, congress or congress ke soochna vibhaag ke aadhikarik twitor handle hack hone ke baad sibar security kii bahes to laazmi he
 But does the social media team of Congress not know the address of its own website? This is because the address of the Congress website on the Wikipedia page of the Indian National Congress is wrong
 yahaan website ke taur par inc
 in is recorded
 ise kholane par aapse yah poocha jaataa he ki kya yah domen aapkaa he? yani is website kaa koi aasatitv hi nahin he
 If we assume that this is an omission of Wikipedia, as other people can edit here
 khayr congress kaa viki pej sicyor he jise edit sabhi nahin kar sakate
 The interesting and surprising thing is that INC also replaced the website on inc's official Twitter handle INC India
 in likhaa he jo kii galat adress he
 The official Twitter handle of the Indian National Congress, claiming the world's largest Democratic Party and updating the wrong website address on Wikipedia, can be a big mistake
 agar google par congress website likh kar search karenge to sabase pehle Inc
 in looks, followed by Pci
 inc
 looks in pehali website to philhal aastitiv main nahin he, jabaki duusari philhal nahin khul rahi he yani website down he
 Although an official website of Congress http: / / aicc
 org
 in / also which is currently opening and Inc
 in kaa link bhi diya gaya he
 The question is whether Congress' upcoming website, Inc
 in he, jisapar puraani website ko shift kiya jayega? lekin agar aisa he bhi to maujuuda sthiti main is domen kaa hosting plan kharidne ke liye kaha ja rahaa he
 This means that someone has booked this domain, but it remains to be worked on
 aise main jab website bani hi nahin to congress har jagah is websot ko aadhikarik website kii tarah likhnaa ajeeb jarur he

 The bewildered parents pulled out their child with the help of neighbors
 bachche ko lekar mata-pita ghar aa gaye
 After a while, the teacher reached his house and drank cough syrup there
 darkar bachche ke mata-pita ne police ko soochna di
 The police admitted the teacher to the hospital
 baccha yah sab dekh sadame main aa gaya
 When his parents took help from counselor Sangeeta Jund, something else came up
 chaatr ne bataaya ki teacher use peethti thi or uske saath jabaran sambandh banaati thi
 Not only this, the teacher had also given the child a SIM card and mobile so that he would talk to her
 chaatr ke mobile main teacher ke kai massej bhi mili the

 PWD officials have sought time till June 25 to clean the Kushak drain in South x Part 2 of the capital Delhi
 court main peedblyoody ke adhikariyon ne 25 june tak naale kii safai karne kaa bharosa jataata he
 Rain has started in Delhi, but the agencies are still not serious about the preparations for the monsoon
 khaas taur se naalon kii safai ko lekar abhi bhi rajdhani main jagah-jagah naalon kii safai kaa kaam shuru tak nahi hua he
 The Delhi High Court was also angry that the Kejriwal government recently responded to what the PWD wrote about cleaning the drains, but the PWD did not follow any instructions and orders given during the 5 years of the High Court Did not hoicourt ne south dilli ke kushak naale ko lekar lagaai gai 5 saal puraani yachika par sunwaayee ke dauraan peedblyoody ke adhikariyon ko jamkar fatkaar lagaai he

 The Delhi High Court was angry that the monsoon is about to come, but the draining of the drains has not been completed yet, and to hide their apathy, they are misleading the official court by giving false affidavits

 He said that more fearless voices are needed in journalism right now

 Satpathy thanked Naveen Patnaik for his support over the years
 unhone yah faisla unki party ke purv saathi baijayant pandas ke bhaajapa main shaamil hone ke ek din pehle liya
 Let me tell you, Panda resigned from the Lok Sabha as well as the Biju Janata Dal due to differences with party president and Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik
 jabaki satpathi ke is faisle ne party ke sabhi logon ko chaunkaa diya he
 After all, who is Tathagata Satpathy? Tathanaga is the son of former Odisha Chief Minister Nandini Satpathy
 satpathi dhenkanal seat se pichle chaar baar se lagaataar loksabhaa saansad hai
 Tathagata Satpathy is the owner and editor of the daily Odisha newspaper, Dharitri, and the Daily Odisha Post
 unhone saal 2000 main odisha gana parishad (ek gaiyr raajnneetik sanghathan) main shaamil hokar, mahasachiv ke pad par kaam kiya tha

 The sealdah-ajmer Express derailed near Kanpur in Uttar Pradesh on Wednesday morning
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki is train ke 15 dibbe patari se utar gaye jisase ye haadasa hua
 The disturbing thing is that just 142 people died in a major train accident at Pukhrayan near Kanpur on November 20, when 14 coaches of the indore-patna Intercity train took off from Patna
 haadase ke baad kuch coach puri tarah malbe main tabdeel ho gaye the
 But how serious the safety of its passengers is after all the accidents, it has become clear from the train accident near Kanpur again

 But there is no denying the fact that despite being the third largest rail system in the world after the US and China, the Indian Railways still operates on the infrastructure of the British era
 jis hisaab se patariyon par railway trephic kaa dabaav bad rahaa he, us hisaab se infrastakchar apgrade nahin ho paa rahaa he
 On one hand, the government is planning to run bullet trains, on the other hand the government has failed to save normal trains from accidents due to lack of change in infrastructure
 railway ke saamne sefti ek bada masalaa bana hua he
 Accidents in the signaling system and lack of anti-collision devices also cause accidents

 The war of socialist clan is going on openly and face to face

 Amar put the fire in the fire, Amar Singh is working to add more ghee to this fire amidst this fierce battle

 However, it is believed that Amar Singh may soon be discharged from the Samajwadi Party

 Seeing the circumstances that are visible at the moment, it seems that Mulayam Khema is expressing her softness in front of Akhilesh
 lekin akhilesh khemaa apni takat ke saath adaavat kar rahaa he
 And without this strength, he is also putting his claim on the bicycle
 akhilesh kheme main shaamil ramgopal yadav kaa kahana he ki 229 vidhayakon main se 212 vidhayak affidavit de chuke hai, 68 main se 56 emelsi unke saath hai or 24 main 15 saansadon ne bhi akhilesh kaa samarthan kiya he
 Talk on the formula of reconciliation, meanwhile, a formula of reconciliation between Mulayam and Akhilesh was also prepared late on Thursday night
 is formule main tay hua tha ki mulaayam singh philhal party sangrakshak bane rahenge or chunaav ke baad rashtriya adhyaksh kaa jimmaa lenge
 At the same time, Shivpal will also quit the post of state president and Akhilesh will have the right to share the ticket
 amar singh party ke sabhi padon se istipha denge
 With this, Mulayam will also withdraw his appeal to the Election Commission

 Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) student union president Kanhaiya Kumar was to have a second appearance here on charges of treason
 kanhaiya par aarope he ki unhone jeenyu main aatankwaadi afjal guru ke samarthan main hue kaarykram main bhagidaari kii or desh virdohi naare lagaae
 Although all the footage of Kanhaiya's speeches so far, he was seen expressing his faith in the Indian Constitution, yet his speech hurt the sentiments of some "patriotic" lawyers
 isliye ‚Äúdesh raksha‚Äù main kanoon ko taak par rakhkar unhone 15 farvari ko pehali peshi ke dauraan na sirf kanhaiya ke saath aae chaatro kii pitayee kii, balki is ghatana ko report karne kii koshish kar rahe patrakaron ko bhi dhun diya
 Congress General Secretary Digvijay Singh commented on the incident, ‚Äúneither Kanhaiya has given an anti-national speech nor committed any crime

 Bassi, who was having 13 days before his retirement, argued, "precaution has to be taken in the case of bookies
 ‚Äù baad main kanhaiya ko pichley daravaaje se tihaad jail le jaaya gaya
 It is also a coincidence that Kanhaiya, who is coming to JNU from a normal family of Bihar and doing phd, was kept in the same cell of jail number 3 in Tihar, where Afzal Guru himself was kept

 As much as the BJP wanted to suppress the case of the death of a Dalit student in Hyderabad University, the more it was deteriorated

 But as the JNU case sprung up, the party began to see political possibilities in the juncture of nationalism
 grih mantri rajnath singh ne do-took kah diya ki desh virdohi naaraa lagane waalon ko bakhsha nahin jayega
 Instead of laying hands on the organizers of the Afzal-related event, the JNU Students' Union president was arrested immediately to increase the political weight of the case

 The BJP also considered the JNU case in its favor in this victory

 ‚Äù isliye party ne 18, 19, 20 farvari ko desh bhar main jan swabhimaan abhiyaan chalaane kaa kaarykram bana liya
 The seriousness of the party can also be gauged from the fact that on the evening of 15 February all the state units were issued a letter on behalf of the National General Secretary Arun Singh
 chitthee kaa majamoon tha-jeenyu prakaran par algagavaadi swaron ko kuch rajnatik takaton kii ore se abhivyakti kii aazaadee kaa naam dekar desh ko bhramit karne kaa jo kutsit prayaas kiya ja rahaa he, uske khilaaf bijepi rajya, jila, mandal str tak jan swabhimaan abhiyaan chalaaegi
 Through this campaign, the party's strategy is to stage a local dharna, signature campaign, memorandum through the district magistrates, intellectual conferences, organizing patriotic song programs, Jan Swabhimaan Chappal, Nukkad Natak

 Therefore, writing a blog on behalf of the BJP president, holding a press conference and then running the public self-respect campaign is also considered as the Prime Minister's consent

 aam aadmi party ne bijepi par 30 lakh votaron ke naam katwane kaa aarope lagaaya he
 At the same time, after the allegations made by the Aam Aadmi Party, the BJP has approached the Election Commission for a complaint of AAP

 The commission has dismissed the allegations of getting the names on the basis of caste from the voter list
 dilli chunaav ayog ke mukhya chunaav adhikari ne saaf kar diya he ki sabhi aarope bebuniyaad hai
 Delhi's Chief Electoral Officer Randeep Singh said that there is no caste or religion criterion behind the vote cut

 All this process is done according to the law

 At the same time, the issue did not come out, so the Aam Aadmi Party is raising the issue of getting the name cut off from the voter list
 AAP is mudde ko bhi raajnneetik or jatigat banane main lagi he
 However, being in the central government, the BJP seems to be on the defensive

 At the same time, allegations were also made that if the local officials tried to get a break in time, there would not be such a big jam
 sthiti itani nahin bigadati
 The local administration, which was handling the situation, also heard different notes in this case

 But Anil Vij defended his government and surrounded the Bhupendra Singh Hooda government in the past by gesturing that our government had been formed only for two years and the entire system has been sick for years
 adhikari apana kaam thik se nahin kar rahe hai
 Our government is engaged in fixing this system

 Khattar listed the reasons for the jam, including the overflow of Badshahpur drain and the ongoing construction work at Honda Chowk and Subhash Chowk, congestion of Kanwars and taxi drivers in Delhi taking taxis to the airport after the strike was over
 khatter ne bhi mana ki gudgaanv kaa sthaneey prashasanjam kii shuruyatisuchana par or tej ection le saktaa tha
 Khattar tried to shake off his hand by saying that similar rains had taken place in metros like Mumbai and Bangalore that day
 vahaan bhi kuch aisa hi haal tha lekin hangaamaa gudgaanv ke jam par zyada machaa
 Senior Congress leader and former Haryana Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hoodane, who did not escape his responsibilities, also surrounded the BJP government, saying that it used to rain even during his reign but there was no such situation
 sthaneey prashasan apana kaam thik se karne main naakaamayaab rahaa
 He said that Haryana government also cannot escape its responsibility by counting the mistakes of local administration
 raajnneeti kii vajah se adhikari belgaumvahin indian neshnal lokdal ke varisht netaa or haryana vidhansabha main vipaksh ke netaa abhaya chautaala ne bhi haryana sarkaar par jamkar hamalaa bolaa
 Chautala said that the government is taking full responsibility for the jam and putting its kanni on the local administration
 jabaki sthaneey prashasan bhi rajya sarkaar ke hi under aata he
 The truth is that due to the politics of the local leaders of Gurgaon, the officers there are unbridled

 Sarkaryavah Bhaiyyaji Joshi wrote this letter to the Prime Minister on behalf of the Sangh, in which the conspiracy of Colonel Purohit and Dayanand Pandey was not just a criminal matter but a political handicap, associated with the conspiracy to kill Sarsanghchalak Mohan Bhagwat and senior campaigner Indresh Kumar on Maharashtra ATS Accused of suppressing the case
 patr kii jaankaree dete hue akhil bhartiya prachaar pramukh manmohan vaidya ne kaha, ‚Äòsangh kaa spasht maananaa he ki karnal purohit kii bhoomika raajnneetik thi or vah apane vivek ke aadhaar par kuch nahin kar rahaa tha
 His attempt was to create a rift between the Sangh and its allies
 usne sarasanghachaalak bhagwat or indresh kumaar ko maarane kii sajeesh rachi jiskaa pataa maharashtra aties ke aaropapatr se chalata he
 He said that despite this, the investigating agencies are linking the Sangh's relationship with such people and are not moving the investigation work on the aspect of the conspiracy to murder
 patr main kaha gaya he ki, ‚Äòpuraa shadyantr vastav main ek raajnneetik hatkandaa he, isliye mahaj aapraadhik chaanbin se kuch pataa nahin chal saktaa he
 It needs to be ascertained what kind of political agenda is behind this and who are the people behind this conspiracy
 isaki jaanch ke liye ek nishpaksh swatantra ayog gathit kiye jane kii jarurat he
 Asked why the subject was not raised earlier when the Sangh was skeptical of the probe agencies' attitude, Vaidya said, "we had already clarified that the agencies would fully cooperate in the investigation process and our expectation Was that the investigation work would be done in a transparent manner
 lekin is dauraan hamane mahasoos kiya ki jaanch agenciyaan jaanboojhkar kaaryakartaaon ko pratadit kar rahi hai or amaryadit vyavhaar evam charitrahanan kar rahi hai
 He said that the investigation is no longer an investigation into a criminal case but has become a weapon of political agenda and propaganda against the Union
 congress ke ek mahasachiv bhi sangh ke viruddh vidweshpurn abhiyaan chalaaye hue hai jisase raajnneetik agenda kii pushti hoti he
 Vaidya said that the Maharashtra ATS did not proceed with the investigation on the conspiracy to kill the leaders of the Sangh, but was deliberately trying to distort the investigation process
 agar is pahalu kii nishpaksh jaanch saamne aae to sangh ke viruddh chalaaye gaye abhiyaan kii hawa nikal aayegi
 Joshi has written in his letter that the Sangh does not usually communicate with political power but the matter is sensitive, so, given its seriousness, provide an opportunity to communicate directly on this subject

 ji haa, credit card lone praapt karnaa itnaa aasaan ho gaya he
 Taking a credit card loan is easy, but it is expensive due to its high interest rate
 bainkon se sidhe lone lene ke mukaable yah mahangaa padataa he
 But still many times people have to take a credit card loan
 aise main aapako yah pataa hona chahie ki credit card lone kab liya jaae or bank se personal lone kii praathamikta kab yani kin halaaton main di jaae
 Even though credit card loans are also being given on the interest of personal loans, but its servicing charges are expensive
 processing fees or pre closer chargees, credit card companiyaan sarvice tex bhi lagaati hai us amount par joki aap bataur byaaj chukaate hai
 
 aise main kul milakar yah manhagaa padataa he
 Service tax is currently 15 per cent (service Tax @ 14% + Swachh Bharat Tax @ 0
 5%+ krishi kalyaan ses@0 
 5%) yadi intrest rate, pre closer chargees or lone prosising fees bank jitani hi rahe tab bhi credit card lone kaa intrest cost sarvice tex ke chalate 15 fisadi zyada hi baithegaa
 For example, if you take a loan of 1 lakh rupees from the bank and on it it charges 14% interest on a 24-month period, then your first month's installment will be Rs 4,802
 isamen byaaj kaa hissaa hoga 1,166
 66, the principal will be 3635
 33 rupee
 If you take a loan with a credit card, at the same interest rate, then the first month you will have to pay 4,976
 99 rupee jisamen se 175 rupee us rakam se zyada honge jo ki aap pehle maheene kii kist ke taur par bank ko chukaate
 This increase is due to service tax which is being given on the credit card loan
 175 rupee sarvice tex 1166
 66 is being given on the interest amount
 tippaniyan For information, let us know that even if you convert a purchase made by credit card payment into an EMI (equated monthly instalment-emi), you pay interest only after applying service tax
 phir bhi kuch maukon par credit card lone ko bank se personal lone lene se behatar bataaya jaataa he
 If you want to take a loan less than Rs 50 thousand for less than 1 year, then credit card loan is better because banks usually do not give loans for less than 1 year and less than Rs 50 thousand
 jabaki, credit card lone chah maheene ke liye bhi dete hai or kam se kam rakam ke liye jaise ki 10 hajaar ke liye bhi dete hai
 You can give preference to such needs

 jaankaree ke liye bataa den ki yadi aap credit card pement se kii gai kharid ko iemai (equated monthly instalment-emi) main conwart karavaate hai tab bhi aap sarvice tex lagaakar hi byaaj dete hai
 Yet on some occasions credit card loans are said to be better than taking a personal loan from a bank
 yadi aap 1 saal se kam samay ke liye 50 hajaar rupee se kam rakam lone par lenaa chaahate hon to credit card lone behatar he kyonki bank aamtaur par 1 saal se kam ke liye or 50 hajaar rupee se kam kaa lone nahin dete
 Whereas, credit card loans are also given for six months and for a minimum amount like 10 thousand
 aisi jaruraton par aap ise variyata de sakate hai

 Prior to the Karnataka elections, the fourth session of the India Today program 'karnataka Panchayat' was attended by actor Prakash Raj, Congress leader Khushboo Sundar, BJP spokesperson Malvika Avinash and Union Minister Babul Supriyo
 inamen se teen hastiyaan film jagat se aati hai
 At the event, BJP spokesperson Malvika said that i am a secular being a Hindu
 malvika ne kaha ki itihaas main hamaare mandiron ko todaa gaya, kai dharm yahaan aae lekin hindu hone ke naate hamane sabko aane diya
 He said that being a Hindu it is my nature to be secular
 malvika ne kaha ki mujhe nahin lagata ki hindutv ke alaava duniya main koi anya dharm he jo sabhi ko apane bheetar sweekaarta he or kisi se jhagada nahin karata
 Love jihad enhances diversity? In response to this question, Malavika said that no one has any problem with love but when things move beyond that, questions arise
 unhone kaha kikerala main dharmantaranakia ja rahaa he, sirf hindu hi nahin balki kerala main isai samudaay ke yuvaaon ko to ISIS main bheja ja rahaa he
 Our fight is against all of them
 malvika ne kaha ki secular or sahishnu kahi jane vaali siddharmaiya sarkaar ne karnataka ko sirf hinsa di he
 He said that 24 people of the sangh-bjp were killed in Siddaramaiah's government
 yahaan tak ki inamen se kai hatyaein to dhara-144 lagu hone baavjood hui hai
 He said that where did the tolerance of this government go then
 karnataka kii siddharmaiya sarkaar par hamalaa karte hue malvika ne kaha ki aap chaahate hai ki dusron ke vichaaron ke prati ham sahishnutaa dikhaaen lekin hamaari vichaardhaara ke prati bhi yah baat lagu hoti he
 But our people are being killed in this government
 unhone kaha ki main prakaash kii tarah nafrat nahin failaati jabaki prakaash kah chuke hai ki unhen hamaare pradhanmantri se nafrat he
 Malvika said that i have respect for every Prime Minister of the country because the people have sent him after electing him
 malvika ne kaha ki karnataka main ab se pehle kabhi bhi raajnneetik or vichaardhaara ke naam paralogon kii hatyaeinnhin kii gai
 He said, but the speed with which these incidents have been happening for the last 5 years, where has the secularism of the government gone
 prakaash ne kiya palatwarprakash raaj ne malvika ke bayaan par jawaab dete hue kaha ki hindu dharm tolerant he lekin bijepi ke netaa apane bayanon main is tolerance ko bhul jate hai
 BJP has no ideology

 bacchee ke saath haivaaniyat se hill uthi he dilli auki saham uthe hai rajdhani ke log
 But it is also surprising with the attitude of Delhi Police
 pehle to bacchee ke parivaar kii beti ko khojane kii guhaar par unhen thane se bhaga diya or ghatana saamne aane ke baad 2 hajaar rupye dekar maa-baap ko munh band rakhane kii naseehat di
 Moreover, when the female protesters in this case wanted to ask the police officers for answers, they got 2 slaps in return
 asipi bies ahlavat ne pradarshan kar rahi yuvati ko aspataal ke andar kam se kam chaar baar thappad maaraa
 He was suspended with immediate effect by Commissioner of Police Neeraj Kumar
 dilli police ke pravaktaa rajan bhagat ne kaha ki hamen is durbhagyapurna ghatana par khed he or bies ahlavat, jo camere par yah rduvyavahaar karte hue dikh rahe hai, unhen nilambit kiya gaya he or vibhageeya jaanch ke aadesh diye gayi hai
 This kind of step cannot be tolerated
 darasal, gandhinagar main 5 saal kii maasoom bacchee ko 2 din tak bandhak banaakar uske saath rape kiya gaya
 When people got the news, they reached the protest outside the hospital
 bheed ke gusse se khajuri khaas ke asipi benny singh ahlavat itnaa bhadak gaye ki unhone ganrape peedita ke liye nyaay kii maang rahi ek ladki ko hi thappad maar diya
 Damn is on this society, curse is on the society's cruelty and also on the Delhi Police whose big officer slaps a girl who is protesting against this incident
 kareeb 48 ghante tak 5 saal kii beti ghar se gaayab rahi
 Not knowing that a lady or a lot of poor people kissed the girl
 sabakuch roka ja saktaa tha agar desh kii sabase smart dilli police ne jaraa si bhi teji or sanjidagi dikhaai hoti
 After the child's parents disappeared, the girl's parents went to the area police station to plead for help, but Mila was left with only hours of frustration and police misbehavior
 bacchee milane or maamle ke khulaase ke baad bavaal machaa hua he
 Aam Aadmi Parchi activists started shouting slogans of Police hi-hi
 lekin police ke beraham chehre kaa ek pahalu abhi saamne aana baaki tha
 When the ruckus started raging more, the Delhi Police started pressuring the child's parents to keep their mouths closed by luring them a few rupees
 5 saal kii phool si maasoom kii haalat abhi bhi najuk bani hui he
 The girl's age is short and her family seems unlikely to save her dearly
 sadaiv aapke saath, aapke liye
 This is the slogan of Delhi Police
 lekin agar dilli police ne maamle main gambhirtha dikhaai hoti shaayad aaj ek phool si maasoom darindagi kaa shikaar hokar maut ke muhane par yun khadi na hoti
 Intense of cruelty
 
 
 dilli ke gandhinagar ilaake main 5 saal kii ek maasoom 15 april ko ghar ke paas hi khelte hue achaanak gaayab ho gai
 Two days later, when she was found, everyone was shaken to see her condition
 balaatkaar ke baad haivaan ne maasoom kii jindagi chhinane kii koi kasar nahin chodi thi
 The rape accusation is made against the girl's neighbor, who lives as a tenant
 gambhir haalat main jakhmi bacchee ko aspataal le jaaya gaya
 When he underwent an operation, a candle and a bottle of oil came out of his stomach
 purvi dilli ke ek aspataal ke isiu main bhartee maasoom kii haalat behad najuk he
 Havan tied the girl in the room for two days
 bacchee ke saath balaatkaar kiya or phir blade markar uski jaan lene kii koshish kii
 You can understand what would have happened to the parents after seeing the condition of the money to keep their mouth shut, but the Delhi Police also injured the parents after this
 rape peedit bacchee ke rishtedaar ke mutabik police ne ladki se hui haivaaniyat kii jaankaree media ko na dene kii hidaayat di
 The police are accused of offering Rs 2000 to the victim's father to keep his mouth shut
 netaaon se dhakkamukkipahle haivaaniyat or phir dilli police ne jis tarah se jakhm die usase logon kaa gussa bhadak uthaa
 Aam Aadmi Party supporters demonstrated fiercely outside the hospital

 Not only this, Congress MP Sandeep Dixit was also punished
 khun se lathpath mili baccheegaayab hone ke 2 din baad yani 17 april ko maasoom bacchee jahaan se mili, wo padosi kaa hi ek ghar tha
 When the girl broke the lock of the neighborhood house after hearing the sound of the girl's groan from the pain, the girl was found soaked with blood
 bacchee ke haath-pair bhi bandhe hue the
 The police have registered a case after the incident that still haunts the accused, but has not yet been caught by the survivor who strangled the life of a 5-year-old innocent girl

 Flights at Delhi airport have also been affected

 According to political experts, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra was allotted a seat away from Rahul Gandhi for a very good reason
 darasal, congress yah sandesh dene kii koshish kar rahi thi ki congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi kii choti bahan priyanka utani hi mahatvapurn hai, jitani kii us meeting main maujuud anya congress ke mahasachiv
 The Congress would not like to give the message that Priyanka Gandhi is being given special consideration as a member of the Gandhi family
 isse na sirf party ke bheetar balki aam logon main bhi ek sakaaratmak sandesh jayega
 With 47-year-old Priyanka Gandhi Vadra formally entering politics on January 23, it has been decided in the Congress party to hold 44 seats out of 80 Lok Sabha seats in Uttar Pradesh
 jabaki baaki siton kii jimmedaari jyotiraditya sindhiya ke kandhon par hogi
 Both are also expected to participate in Rahul Gandhi's roadshow starting on Monday
 gauratlab he ki priyanka gandhi wadra ko rahul gandhi ne loksabhaa chunaav ke liye purvi uttar pradesh kii jimmedaari di he
 Jyotiraditya Scindia has been given the responsibility of western Uttar Pradesh with him
 congress party ne uttar pradesh kii sabhi 80 loksabhaa seat par chunaav ladane kaa faisla kiya he
 In a meeting of Congress general secretaries, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said that she will take life to overthrow the BJP
 sutron ke mutabik priyanka ne kaha he ki congress adhyaksh kaa jo bhi aadesh hoga wo maanengi or zimmedaari puri karne kii koshish karengi
 Not only this, he also said that i am going to UP not only for 2019 but for a long time
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki loksabhaa chunaavon ke liye uttar pradesh ke ummidavaaron kaa chayan farvari ke aakhir tak ho jaayegaa
 The motive behind Priyanka's separation from Rahul Gandhi is clear that the Congress will not want to give the message under any circumstances that Priyanka Gandhi (priyanka Gandhi Vadra) is getting an advantage due to coming from Rahul Gandhi's sister and Gandhi family
 is
 yahi vajah he ki jab congress mukhyalay main priyanka gandhi ko cameraa aavantit kiya gaya, tab unke saath hi jyotiraditya sindhiya ko bhi shift kiya gaya
 Earlier, only Priyanka Gandhi's name plate was put up, but overnight Jyotiraditya Scindia's nameplate was also placed outside the same room and it was told that both of them would be the same
 us vakt bhi congress ne yahi sandesh dene kii koshish kii thi ki party ke liye jyotiraditya sindhiya kaa jo pad or kad he, vahi priyanka gandhi kaa bhi he
 If sources are to be believed, Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi, Jyotiraditya Scindia will go to Lucknow on 11 February
 priyanka gandhi or jyotiraditya sindhiya pehle teen din lakhanu main rahenge or sthaneey netaaon se mulaakaat kaa daur chalegaa
 He will then attend road shows in other areas and will also visit Allahabad
 isse pehle buudhvaar ko priyanka gandhi ke congress mukhyalay pahunchane ke saath hi badi sankhya main congress kaaryakarta vahaan jamaa ho gaye or 'priyanka gandhi jindabad', priyanka nahin ye aandhi he, duusari indira gandhi he', priyanka gandhi ai he, nayi roshni laai he' ke naare lagane lage
 She spent about 15 minutes at the Congress headquarters and during this time she met local party leaders and workers from some districts of Uttar Pradesh

 a massive fire broke out in a coaching center in Surat, Gujarat, killing 22 children
 surat main aag itani bhayanak lagi thi ki bachche jaan bachaane ke liye chauthi manzil se kud gaye
 It cannot be said about when to face such a situation, but you should always face such situation both physically and mentally
 aaj ham aapako aag kii ghatnaon par bachane ke liye kuch jaruri baaten bataane ja rahe hai
 By adopting those, you can save yourself and others' lives in emergencies
 - aag lagane ke baad bilkul bhi painic na ho
 If there is smoke, keep your head down
 yadi koi bhi suraksha upaay nahin he to apana roomaal pani main bhigoen or use apni naak par rakh len
 This will remove some carbon particles, you will be able to breathe well
 - jaise hi maaloom chale kii aag lag gai he to jitna jaldi ho sake vahaan se nikalne kii koshish karen
 If this is not possible and the room is filled with smoke, then in that case immediately open the windows
 vahiin koshish karen aapkaa sar neeche hi ho
 - If the fire is in a tall building, do not use the lift to get down accidentally
 agar aag sidhiyon tak na pahunchi ho to sidhiyon se utarane kii koshish karen
 - If a person is burnt by fire, do not lie on the ground
 use kambal yaa kisi baari kapade main lapetane kii koshish karen
 - On the other hand, if you have worn such clothes which can catch fire quickly, then take it off and throw it away, in such a situation it is more important to save your life
 - aapako bataa den, yadi aag kapadon tak aa jaae to jameen par ludhakar use bujhane kii koshish karen
 If you get a sheet, blanket or other big cloth, then wrap it on the body
 - jaise hi aapako ashanka ho ki aag lagane vaali he
 So in that case, first of all call the fire brigade and the ambulance

 Naxalites are preparing themselves to respond to sudden attacks and surgical strikes by police and central security forces
 central cameti ko andaja tha ki police or kendriya surakshabalon ke jawan un par sargical strike jaisi karrwai kar sakate hai
 Hence they have also mobilized anti-aircraft guns and are now strengthening their cadre with such training
 unke is prashikshan se police bhi pashopes main he
 He has no answer to this training of Naxalites
 naksaliyon ko sabak sikhaane ke liye betaab he javanchhattisgarh main naksaliyon ke tamaam daavon ko nestnabut karne ke liye police or kendriya surakshabalon ke javaanon ne bhi qamar kas lee he
 They not only want to give a befitting reply to the Sukma attack, but they also want to pay back the previous account
 CRPF par lagaataar hue hamalon se sabak lekar police or kendriya surakshabalon ke jawan nai ranneeti ke tahat jangal main nakilyon kii gheraabandi main jute hue hai
 This time the steps of the security forces within the forest are moving towards that which are likely to be hidden by the Naxals

 jharkhand sarkaar ne diwali ke tohfe ke taur par naksali vaardaat main maare gaye 64 saamaanya nagarikon ke parivaar ko sarkari naukari kaa niyukti patr diya
 According to the information, the families of ordinary civilians who were killed in the deadly incidents continued to plead for the rights
 der se hi sahi sarkaar ne diwali ke khaas maukey ko dekhte hue diwaali ke tohfe ke rup main naksali vaardaat main maare logon ke parivaar waalon ko sarkari naukari kaa niyukti patr saunpa he
 It is being told that the government has given appointment letters to the dependents of 64 ordinary civilians killed in the deadly incidents as per the provision
 isamen se sirf khunti jila ke 41 ashrith parivaar hai
 What the government says is the provision of the government, in fact, if a normal citizen is also killed in a Naxalite incident, then any member of his family will be given a government job
 saath hi muaavja bhi diya jayega
 On this occasion, Chief Minister Raghuvar Das and DGP Kamal Nayan Choubey said that there were frequent complaints that the people killed in the Naxalite attack were running for their rightful rights
 magar unhen muaavja or naukari nahin mil paa rahaa he
 He further said that this time, 64 people are being given jobs, removing all the hurdles
 ye naukari maare gaye insaan ko to waapas nahin laa saktaa, lekin unke parivaar ke liye roji-roti or sammaan se jeene kaa jariya jarur ban saktaa he
 At the same time, the families who get jobs are happy but if it took 10 years to get this right, then more than 6 years
 haalanki diwaali ke pehle sarkaar kaa ye sarkari tohfa tohfe se apano ko khone waalon ke jakhmon par maraham to lagane kaa kaam kar rahi he
 It is obvious that with this step, the government also wants to send a message to the public that it is with the people and the people should also support it in the elections

 In Yamunanagar district of Haryana, a married woman committed suicide by hanging herself after seven months of marriage
 mritka kaa vivaah saat maah pehle uske saath balaatkaar karne vaale aaropee ke saath jabaran karaayaa gaya tha
 The case is of Jagadhri of Yamunanagar
 jahaan thik ek saal pehle anuj naam ke ek yuvak ne 18 varshiya yuvati puja (kaalpanik naam) ke saath balaatkaar kiya tha
 Police then arrested the accused Anuj
 is ghatana ke kram ke kuch maah baad samaaj ke kuch thekedaaron ne peedita par aaropee ke saath hivivahakarne kaa dabaav banaaya
 Due to this, Pooja was married to Anuj who raped her seven months ago
 iske baad puja ne uske khilaaf darj karai gai shikaayat bhi waapas le lee
 After which the stain on Anuj was washed away
 tabhi se puja uske saath rah rahi thi
 But she was not happy with this marriage
 sutron ke mutabik cese waapas ho jane ke baad anuj use pareshaan karne laga tha
 After which, on Tuesday, Pooja committed suicide by hanging herself in her room
 soochna milane par police maukey par ja pahunchi or shav ko kabje main lekar postmortem ke liye bhej diya
 Now the police is investigating the case
 ghatnah 1 jhaansi jile kii garautha tehsil kecimariya gaanv ke kisaan kheton main ghus rahi aawaara gaayon se lambey samay se pareshaan the
 Three years of drought had already broken them, the overflowing this year had upset the urad-moong crop
 bachi-khuchi fasal par aawaara gaayon kii najar thi
 That is why the villagers sat on the watch at night
 gaayon kaa jhund khet main ghusata, isse pehle hi gaanv waalon ne unhen khadedsa shuru kar diya
 When the villagers were satisfied that they had driven the Revad out of the village, then it caused a lot of trouble to them
 gaayen ab shajapur gaanv main ghusane vaali thim or vahaan ke log bhi gaayon se utane hi trast the
 As a result, the cow went to one side and people from both villages started throwing stones at each other
 police bulani padi
 But seeing the number of cows and the attitude of the villagers, the police could not do anything except suppress the case
 ghatnah 2 isi jile main 18 sitambar ko babina ke paas gram panchayat khandi ke keshav rajput ne gaur kiya ki kuch gaayen ek-do din se apni hi jagah par baithi hai
 She has not gone anywhere
 unhone paas jaakar dekha to sann rah gaye
 Long-iron nails were thrust into the hoof of the cows
 pairon main gahare jakhm ho gaye the
 Some were injured in the wounds
 poochtacha kii to pataa chalaa ki paas ke gaanv nayapura ke rajput samudaay ke hi log apni fasal ko in jaanwaron se ho rahe nuksaan se is kadar khafa the ki gomata ke khuron main keel thokane jaisaa krur kaam kar baithe
 After heavy pressure, the police registered an FIR in the case
 bundelkhand ke ek hi jile kii ye do ghatnaayen, kya usee desh main ho rahi hai, jo pichley ek-do saal se gorakshakon kaa aatank dekh rahaa he
 Where a person can be killed by blaming the accusation of eating cow meat
 jahaan mari gaay kaa chamada utaarne par daliton kii pitayee ho rahi ho
 And the situation worsened to the extent that the Prime Minister himself had to intervene and say that some anti-social elements are running their shops in the name of cow protection
 goraksha ke aise aakraamak daur main gaanv vaale aakhir kyon goraksha ke bajaae gopratadia par utarane ko majaboor hue? ye ghatnaayen sirf inhen gaanvon main nahin hui hai
 Ask the police of any district of Bundelkhand, she will tell you that the cases of skirmishes between the villagers are coming to her for stinging cow in the field
 in maamalon main police gaanv waalon ko samajha nahin paati or gaay ko samajhane kaa to khayr sawaal hi nahin uthta
 Meanwhile, on October 11, when a cow entered a farm in the Chitawa police station area of nagaur district of Rajasthan, farmer Jagdish beat up Goshala's shepherd Parmaram so much that he had to refer the district hospital in critical condition
 vahiin, madhya pradesh ke raisen jile ke udaipura or khilvaani gaanvon main kisaan tab aamane-saamne aa gaye jab ek gaanv ke kisaan gaayon ko tractor main bharkar duusare gaanv main chhod gaye
 In order to deal with such situations, struggle committees have been formed in the villages
 uttar pradesh, madhya pradesh or rajasthan ke akhabaaron ke sthaneey sanskarnon main is tarah kii khabaren takreeban roj najar aa rahi hai
 This is a changing picture of a village in North India, where people worship the cow, but can neither raise it nor allow them to eat their crop
 gram samaaj or gomata ke bich bigadate sur-taal ko kareeb se dekhne ke liye india today ne dilli se mathura, agra, gwalior, jhaansi, banda hote hue elahabaad tak kaa kareeb 1,000 kimi kaa safar kiya
 During this time, the scene of vehicles escaping from cows on the highway, injured or dead cows on the highway were common
 kai jagahon par halaat aise the, jahaan 100 gaayon tak ke jhund raat main sadak par is tarah khadey the ki unhen hataane ke liye gaadi se utarana laazmi tha
 But the most sensitive scenes were those where the cows were flocked to the fields
 aise vaakye bhi dekhne main aae jab uttar pradesh ke ilaakon main gaanv waalon ne sambhavit vidhansabha pratyaashiyon ke saamne pehali shart aawaara gaayon se nijaat dilaane kii hi rakh di
 All these views were indicating that the rural life of North India is no longer that way for a cow, where Gopal is playing the flute and the cows graze and become engrossed in listening to it
 balki vah to vaisaa bhi nahin rah gaya jaisaa aaj se dedh-do dashak pehle tak hua karata tha
 In both sociology and economics of the village, the cow no longer has the same role
 beghar huin biimaar or banjh gayenvaise to bharat duniya kaa sabase zyada doodh utpaadan karne vaala desh he

 63 karod ton litre salanaa ke doodh utpaadan ke karname main bhens or gaay kii hi mukhya bhoomika he
 Taking the Census of 2012, we will find that out of 51 crore cattle in the country, the number of cattle is close to 19 crore
 isamen se bail-bachhadon ko hataa den to gaay kii sankchaya 12 karod se kuch adhik he
 In terms of numbers, cows are twice that of buffaloes
 or sirf gaanvon kii baat karen to har gaanv main ausatan 306 gaay-bail baithte hai
 But the real problem is that of Jammu and Kashmir Animal Breeding Specialist Farhat Umar, "A cow in Israel gives more than 10,000 liters of milk a year, whereas on an average a cow gives 2,000 to 2,500 liters of milk
 " sahiwal, tharaparkar or gir jaisi bhartiya nasl kii gaayen jarur bahut acchhee maatra main doodh detii hai, lekin is tarah kii shuddh nasl kii gaayon kii sankhya bahut simit he
 The cows abandoned in the village are of the same spoiled breed giving less milk
 aisa nahin he ki in gaayon kii sirf nasl kharaab hui he, inke kam doodh dene kii ek vajah inamen punap rahi bimaariyaan bhi hai
 Cows are the victims of intestinal TB (johnny's TB)
 is beemaari ke kaaran gaay ke sharir ko khaanaa lagata nahin he
 Not only this, which a desi cow can give milk for 10-12 years in its entire life, it becomes infertile only after the birth of two to three children
 is tarah kii gaay ko paalane ke bajaae aawaara chhod dene main hi log apni bhalaai samaj rahe hai
 The head of the animal health branch at the Central Goat Research Institute in Mathura, which developed the vaccine in 2014, to control the disease, Dr
 shoorveer singh bataate hai, ''yah beemaari doodh or gobar ke jariye bhi fail jaati he
 In general, the bacteria die by boiling the milk, but this bacteria protects itself even after pasteurization
 " dow
 Singh regrets that in 2014 the Government of India did not promote it extensively despite accepting his vaccine
 unka maananaa he ki aisa karne se gaayon ke biimaar or kam doodh dene kii samasya kaaphi had tak dur ho jaati
 However, this is the case of cows, on the other hand, the condition of the bull is worse
 kheti-baadi main ab hal-bail kaa istemaal na ke baraabar rah gaya he
 They have become completely unusable
 pehle uttar bharat main aam chalan yahi tha ki log apane bachhadon ko duusare rajyon se aane vaale vyapaariyon ko bech dete the
 These merchants used to buy calves from village to village, prepare a large herd and then bash the jugs and send them to some abattoir
 chunki bachhda aankh ke saamne yaa aas-paas ke ilaake main nahin katataa tha, isse kisaan kii aatma par gohatya kaa boj nahin padataa tha or vyaavhaarik rup se gaanv ko is anupayogi pashu kaa boj nahin uthaanaa padataa tha
 Sudhir Panwar, member of the Uttar Pradesh Planning Commission, says, "it can only be said that people have started selling and buying calf due to extreme cow protection
" gokshi pehle kii tulana main kam hui he
 But we do not currently have another practical way to deal with unsuitable animals
 " haalanki 2007 kii pashuganana kii tulana main 2012 kii pashuganana main gaay-bail kii sankhya main maamuli kami ai he, lekin isamen iskaa zikr nahin he ki aawaara gaay-bail kii sankhya ghati he yaa pehle se badi he
 It is but natural for Gochar to take possession of the land and the BJP office at Kanji House, to raise the question that such cow-bulls may not be of much use to human beings, but do they not have the right to live? After all, when humans and cows would not have such a deep relationship, even then they would be wandering on the land of their share? In fact, it has happened that under the pressure of increasing population, the area of pasture or pasture in the villages has become very less
 jis jameen par maweshiyon ko ghaas charani thi, us jameen par ab kheti ho rahi he
 If we take the example of Jhansi, then 200 acres of land in the district is registered in the name of Gauchar
 lekin hakeekat yah he ki isamen se zyaadaatar jameen par avaidh kabje ho gaye hai
 Farmer leader Shivnarine Singh Parihar says that during the Mayawati government, leases were also given to people from the land of transit
 lekin revan gaanv main isi tarah ke pattadharak kallu ahirwar, ghasita or saraman palat kar sawaal karte hai, ''hamen sarkaar ne patte die hai
 They have met on the land of village society or know this government on visible land
 isamen hamaari galati kahaan he?" samasya ke vyapak pahalu par najar daudaayen to paaenge ki desh main 14 karod hectare jameen par kheti hoti he
 Earlier 10 percent of this land was available for pasture, at this time the land available for pasture has reduced to 4 to 5 percent
 aise main maveshi pet bharne ke liye kheton kaa rukh karne ko majaboor hai
 And this is where the tension between human and cow starts
 is sangharsh main gaay kaa paksh lete hue vishwa hindu parishad ke kendriya mantri, guseva, khemchandra sharma kehete hai, ''sarkaar ko gochar kii bhoomi se kabje hataane chahie or goabhayaarany banane chahie
 "by the way, to prevent this tension from becoming fatal, there used to be an alternative to animal prison i

 Kanji House
 iske tahat yah vyavastha thi ki yadi koi pashu kisi ke khet main ghusata tha to khet kaa maalik us pashu ko kanji house main band kara saktaa tha
 When the owner of the cattle was aware of this, he would free the cattle by paying the prescribed fine
 kanji house kaa sanchaalan gramin kshetra main gram panchayat or shahari kshetra main nagar nikaay kiya karte the
 In Jhansi district itself, there was a Kanji House on the first eight villages
 lekin jaise-jaise aawaara pashuon kii sankhya badhati gai or kanji house main pashuon ko chhudaane waalon kaa aana kam ho gaya to inkaa sanchaalan kathin ho gaya
 Currently, not a single Kanji House is functioning in the district
 sabase buree gat jhaansi shahar ke kanji house kii hui
 It happened that in 1997-98, Dhannulal became the chairman of the Gautam Municipality of BJP and BJP MLA Ravindra Shukla became a minister from Jhansi Sadar
 donon netaaon ke prayaas se kanji house kii jameen bijepi ke jila karyaalay ke liye dene kaa prastaav nagar palika se paarit kara liya gaya
 The district office of BJP now runs here
 shukla bataate hai, ''kanji house khandhar tha, vahaan bijepi karyaalay banane ke liye hamane pahal karai thi
 "at the same time, Jhansi Municipal Commissioner Arun Prakash says," i do not know when and how Kanji House was given to BJP
 "aupchaarikta kii goshaalaayengramin jivan main govansh kii bhoomika simit ho jane, charaagaah kii jameen ke duusare kaam main istemaal hone or kanji house bhi khatm hone ke baad maweshiyon ko niyantrit karne kaa ek hi rasta bachataa he‚Äîgoshaala
 In Uttar Pradesh, where 65 gaushalas were registered in 1967, their number increased to 390 in 2015
 lekin sankhya badaae kaa matlab yah nahin he ki goshaalaayein itani sari gaayon kii raksha kar sakati hai
 Now take the example of Banda
 paryaavaran kaaryakarta ashish sagar ko artiai se praapt jaankaree ke mutabik, jile main nau goshaalaayein panjikrut hai
 In total there are 295 cows and calves in these cowsheds
 ho saktaa he ye goshaalaayein inaki sabase acchhee seva karti hon, lekin itane aawaara pashu to banda jile ke chaar gaanvon ke chauraahon par khadey mil jaaenge
 That is, the capacity of cowsheds is very limited
 isi tarah kaa haal lakhanu ke janakipuram ilaake kii lakshmana goshaala kaa he
 The Municipal Corporation has given the responsibility of maintenance of this cowshed to Jeevashraya Sanstha
 dhai acre main faili goshaala main 650 gaay hai
 The Municipal Corporation here pays Rs 40 daily for cow's dinner
 prati gaay kharch detaa he
 For eight years, the money is being given at the same rate
 itane paise main kya lakhanu jaise shahar main goseva ho sakati he?or jab goseva nahin ho sakati to kai log goseva ke naam par apni dukaan chalaanaa shuru kar dete hai, jaisaa ki pradhanmantri ne apane bhaashan main kaha tha
 Animal trade has cooled in western Uttar Pradesh due to fear of self-proclaimed cow protection

 These people were bringing cows under the Kamadhenu scheme

 Later the police somehow pacified the case
 is tarah kii ghatnaon se kinaaraa karte hue viechpi ke kendriya mantri ashok tiwari kehete hai, ''hamaare paas gorakshak naam se koi dal nahin he
 But if the activists get information about Gotskari, they inform the police about it
 " maharashtra main bhi goraksha ke liye police ne sakht kadam uthaae the
 Under this, the cow rearers had to go to the police station at regular intervals to tell them the condition of their cattle
 aisa bhale hi goraksha ke liye kiya gaya ho, lekin asal main isse log gaay paalan se dur hi hote chale gaye

 yah ghatana shaam lagbhag saadhe chaar baje kii he, lekin uski hatya se hi ugravadiyon ko santosh nahin mila
 He called the press conference and shot dead body in front of TV cameras

 Almost all the Santhals killed were Christians and NDFB militants were also Christians
 isi aadhaar par adhikariyon kaa daawa he ki yah sampradayik khun-kharaba nahin tha
 According to the Assam Police, the NDFB, formed in 1986 for the alleged purpose of creating a separate sovereign Bodoland in areas north of the Brahmaputra, killed at least 120 people in two incidents of genocide in May and December 2014
 mritkon main 46 naaballig the, jinamein teen maheene kii aayu ke shishu bhi the, jinhen unki maataaon kii god main hi goli se uda diya gaya tha
 According to police, 152 people were killed in Assam in late 2014, the highest in the Northeast
 khufia beuro ke tatkaaleen pramukh saiyad asif ibrahim ne november main guwahati main khulaasa kiya tha ki 85 fisadi hatyaon ke liye endiefabi-es jimmedaar he
 In the Bodoland Territorial Autonomous Districts (BTAD), where the NDFB has the highest impact, some 1,000 people have died and more than 1,300 people have been kidnapped in the past five years
 police paanch varshon main 700 hathiyaar baraamad kar chuki he, lekin mana jaataa he ki rajya main ugravadiyon ke paas maujuud hathiyaaron kaa yah maatr 5 pratishat he
 Assam police and security forces seized 160 illegal weapons in 2014, 90 percent of which were recovered in BTAD
 lekin assam police kii vishesh shakha ke ek adhikari ne india today ko bataaya ki rajya main endiefabi-es ke sirf 120 sashastr sadsy hai
 Assam has witnessed a spate of violence of all kinds in the past years ‚Äî factional, communal, inter-tribal, tribal versus non-tribal
 ashanka yah he ki narsanhaaron kaa yah silsilaa tej hi hoga
 Things may get worse in the near future
 rajya ko united libration front of assam (ulpha) ke nae sire se utpann khatre se jujhna hoga, jo 1979 main bane sabase puraane ugravadi sanghathanon main ek he
 According to intelligence reports, the Paresh Baruah faction of ULFA has not shied away from its demand for sovereign Assam and is planning to attack Hindi-speaking people and some top BJP leaders in the state
 barua pehle hi 23 disambar ke narsanhaar ke liye endiefabi-es kaa samarthan yah kahkar kar chukaa he ki aisi hatyaein ek 'bade yuddh‚Äô kii ranneeti kaa hissaa hoti hai
 But in this war, groups like NDFB and ULFA may have to face the almost unexpected enemy-maoists
 kendriya grih mantralay ko ashanka he ki 23 disambar ke narsanhaar ke baad maovadi chaay baganon main kaam kar rahe adivaasiyon ke bich paith banane kii koshish karenge
 There are more than five million Adivasis living in Assam, who were brought by the British mainly from Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Bihar to work in their tea gardens
 vishesh shakha ke ek adhikari kehete hai, ''haal ke narsanhaar ke baad adivasee log apni suraksha ko lekar ashankit ho jaaenge
 In such a situation, it is possible that the tea plantation workers will bow to the Maoists for their protection from the Bodo people

 One side in the game of violence is Muslim militant groups, particularly Bangladesh-based jamaat-ul-mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB)
 ashanka he ki vah 2014 main musalamaanon ke khilaaf hui hinsa kaa badla lene ke liye kabhi bhi hamalaa kar saktaa he
 This is exactly what the National Investigation Agency (NIA) has come up with while investigating the blast in a house in Burdwan city of West Bengal on 2 October

 One such controversial issue is that of the National Civil Register (NRC)
 supreme court ne 16 disambar ko enarasi ko adhyatan karne kaa rasta saaf kar diya or is prakriya ko janvari 2016 tak puraa karne kaa aadesh diya
 This issue has also been a subject of controversy in the past as it aims to identify illegal intruders
 kai dashakon se rajya main based musalamaanon ko lagata he ki yah unhen nishaanaa banane kaa ek bahaanaa he
 The pilot project to update the NRC was halted in 2010 when the All Assam Minorities Students' Union started violence in Barpeta district

 a senior Congress leader told India Today that RSS workers are active in the district and are pitting both the NDFB and the Santhals against each other
 unhone kaha, ''yah donon ko samaapt karne kii bijepi-aresas kii ranneeti he, kyonki ve isai hai
 "in response, Assam BJP President Siddharth Bhattacharya says that his party does not make any such strategy
 pradesh bijepi philhal vivaadon ko or tikhaa nahin hone dene kaa prayaas kar rahi he
 Party leaders are also wary of visits by leaders like Praveen Togadia and Subrahmanyam Swamy, as communal remarks can also backfire in this multi-ethnic state

 IIM main librarian kii naukari paane kaa maukafaushshchh ne nikaali clerk kii vaikencikai padon ke liye 154 vaikenciighinsh ne nikaali professor pad ke liye vaikency Navi Mumbai Police is searching for 2 suspected youths who prey on innocent girls
 police ke paas saboot ke naam par bas sandigdh kaa sisitivi footage he jiske liye ab aam janata se bhi uski soochna dene kaa aavahan kiya gaya he
 a reward of 10 thousand rupees has also been announced to the informer of the suspects
 navi mumbai krime branch ke police upayukta tushaar dosi ke mutabik navi mumbai main april, may or june main sanpada, belapur or khaarghar main naaballig se balaatkaar ke teen maamle darj hue hai
 Similar cases have also been reported in Kandivali and Dindoshi in Mumbai
 vaardaat ke aasapaas ke sisitivi tasveeron ke jariye police ko 2 yuvakon par shaq he
 In CCTV, one person is seen wearing a red T-shirt while the other is wearing a blue T-shirt
 duusare sandigdh par aarope he ki usne koparkhayrane or turbhe main balaatkaar kii vaardaat ko anjaam diya he
 The comments takreeban 20 se 25 saal ke ye donon sandigdh april se agast tak mumbai or navi mumbai me 7 vaardaaton ko anjaam de chuke hai
 Both the ways of carrying out the crime are the same, but whether the two are together, it is not yet clear
 police ke mutabik abhi tak kii jaanch main pataa chalaa he ki ye nimna madhyam vargeey naaballig ladakiyon kii pehle pahchaan karte hai, phir unhen ye bolkar ki unke pita ne kaam se bulaayaa he, apane saath chalane ko kehete hai
 When the girl is ready to walk, she takes her away in seclusion and runs away after committing the crime
 sisitivi ke jariye police ko donon kii tasviren bhi mil chuki hai lekin abhi tak donon hi pakad se baahar hai
 According to the Navi Mumbai Police, every effort is being made to apprehend the two
 krime branch or police kii alag-alag timen banaakar sabhi sambhavit thikaanon par talaashi jari he lekin tasviir ke alaava donon ke bare main koi bhi jaankaree uplabdh nahin ho paane se inhen pakadaa paanaa sambhav nahin ho paa rahaa he
 Therefore, a reward of 10 thousand rupees has also been announced to those giving information about them
 chunki 2 maamle mumbai main kandiwali or dindoshi ke bhi hai isliye mumbai police bhi donon sandigdhon kii talash main juty he
 These two suspects, aged about 20 to 25 years, have committed 7 incidents in Mumbai and Navi Mumbai from April to August
 vaardaat ko anjaam dene kaa donon tarika ek jaisaa he lekin kya donon aapas main mili hue hai, ye abhi saaf nahin ho paaya he
 According to the police, investigations have so far revealed that these lower middle-class minors first identify the girls, then ask them to accompany them, saying that their father has called them from work
 jab ladki chalane ko taiyaar ho jaati he tab use bahaane se ekant main le jaakar vaardaat ko anjaam dekar bhaag khadey hote hai
 Police have also received photographs of both of them through CCTV but so far both are out of the hold
 navi mumbai police ke mutabik donon ko pakadaney ke liye har sambhav koshish kii ja rahi he
 Searching is going on at all possible locations by building separate teams of crime branch and police but it is not possible to get them captured due to lack of any information about both of them apart from the photo
 isliye ab inaki soochna dene waalon ko 10 hajaar rupee kaa inaam dene kii bhi ghoshnaa kii gai he
 Since 2 cases are also related to Kandivali and Dindoshi in Mumbai, Mumbai police is also looking for both the suspects
 sisitivi ke jariye police ko donon kii tasviren bhi mil chuki hai lekin abhi tak donon hi pakad se baahar hai
 According to the Navi Mumbai Police, every effort is being made to apprehend the two
 krime branch or police kii alag-alag timen banaakar sabhi sambhavit thikaanon par talaashi jari he lekin tasviir ke alaava donon ke bare main koi bhi jaankaree uplabdh nahin ho paane se inhen pakadaa paanaa sambhav nahin ho paa rahaa he
 Therefore, a reward of 10 thousand rupees has also been announced to those giving information about them
 chunki 2 maamle mumbai main kandiwali or dindoshi ke bhi hai isliye mumbai police bhi donon sandigdhon kii talash main juty he

 Due to this, the development of minorities, especially Muslims, was limited to papers
 ' Naqvi said to the minorities, especially the Muslims, that they should evaluate the central government on the basis of its actions and not from those who are responsible for political exploitation of the Muslim community
 unhone kaha, aazaadee ke baad se alpsankhyakon kii shiksha, vikaas or shashaktikaran ke naam par jitna dhan kharch kiya kiya gaya usase to ab in virgon se sambandhit ek bhi vyakti ko garibi rekha ke neeche nahin rahanaa chahie tha

 He called for the need to carry out a campaign on a war footing to free Waqf properties from the 'waqf Mafias'

 The Minister of State for Minority Affairs said this at the inauguration of the Central Waqf Building
 is maukey par alpsankhyak maamalon kii mantri najma hepatulla bhi maujuud thim

 He said, since the amount of money spent in the name of education, development and empowerment of minorities since independence, not a single person belonging to these sections should live below the poverty line
 tippaniyan Naqvi alleged, 'the money was not spent properly and middlemen and power brokers continued to loot that money

 Attacking Ashok Gehlot, Sundar Raje attacked Congress General Secretary Ashok Gehlot and said that they become active as soon as the elections come, otherwise they do not know where they live

 lekin ab yah nai taazgi ke saath un beeti yaadon ko dobaaraa taaja karne aa rahaa he
 Mohnish Bahl and Gurdeep Kohli Punj, who were earlier actors of 'sanjivani', will also be seen in this show carrying forward the previous tradition

 The special thing is that real doctors are also reaching the set of 'sanjivani' to talk to the artists
 saath hi ve kalakaaron ko parde par ek doctor ke role ke liye mahatvapurn jaankariyaan bhi de rahe hai
 Actually, the original form of the show 'sanjivani' is similar to the original

 Apart from this, all the actors of Sanjeevani are ready to cast a spell on the audience with their touching performances

 Real doctors are coming on the sets for 'sanjeevani' and they are also giving us information about body language, general medical talk and many small things
 unhone hamen ek doctor kis tarah gloves pahananaa,marij kii beepi check karnaa or stethoscope pakadaney kaa sahi tarika bhi bataaya he

 chotil wicketiper ballebaaj riddhimaan saaha kii jagah afghanistan ke khilaaf 14 june se bengalooru main khele jane vaale aitihaasik test match main dinesh karthik ko bhartiya team main jagah mil sakati he
 According to sources close to the selection committee, the selection committee headed by MSK Prasad may take this decision keeping in mind the tour to England, where Karthik can also make a place in the Test team
 khaas baat yah he ki 2007 main bharat ke england daure par karthik test siries main safal rahe the
 He played 60 innings at Lord's, 77 at Nottingham and 91 at the Oval
 VIDEO: IPL champion banane ke baad dhoni ko jeeva ne yun pilaai apni fruitikarthik ne saal 2010 main bangladesh ke khilaaf apana pichhlaa test match khelaa tha
 However, his record in first class matches is superb, where he has scored more than 9000 runs including 27 centuries
 bharat ke liye 23 test maichon main unhone ek shatak or saat ardhashatak ke saath 1000 ran banaae hai
 PM Narendra Modi and Amit Shah have set a target of winning 300 Lok Sabha seats for Mission 2019
 is baar bijepi kaa khaas focus un rajyon par he, jahaan 2014 ke chunaav main nattejey party ke liye bahut behatar nahin rahe the
 One of these states is West Bengal, where the BJP could win only two Lok Sabha seats in the last Lok Sabha election
 bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne ajtak ke program sidhi baat main daawa kiya ki 2019 main bijepi pashchim bengal kii kul 42 main se 22 loksabhaa siten jeetegi
 These 5 factors can prove to be effective in bjp's Bengal Mission
 1
 The polarization process is also taking place in West Bengal on the lines of Assam and Tripura
 rajya main muslim aabaadi kareeb 30 fisadi he
 In such a situation, an exercise is being made to create environment against Mamata Banerjee government through polarization
 haal ke dinon main raniganj samet bengal ke kai ilaakon main sampraadayik hinsa kii ghatnaayen dhruvikaran kaa maahaul taiyaar kar rahi he
 Taking a dig at these violent incidents, Babul Supriyo, a minister in the central government, told the Mamata government even to the jihadi government
 isse pehle murti visarjan ko lekar bhi bijepi ne mamata sarkaar ke khilaaf hallaa bolaa tha
 Polarization in West Bengal can prove to be a lifeline for the BJP
 2
 Sanjeevani for TMC rebel BJP In West Bengal, BJP has received Sanjivani from rebel leaders of TMC
 mamata ke kareebi rahe mukul roy bijepi main shaamil ho chuke hai or party ko majboot karne main jute gaye hai
 Similarly, BJP had included former Congress leader Himanta Biswa Sharma before the Assam Assembly elections
 iskaa nateeja rahaa tha ki bijepi purvottar ke kisi rajya main pehali baar sarkaar banane main kaamyaab rahi thi
 Similarly, in Tripura, BJP along with rebel leaders of congress-tmc demolished the fort of the Left
 mana jaataa he ki isi formule ke tahat pashchim bengal main mukul roy ko laayaa gaya he
 It is understood that Mukul Roy is trying to bring many TMC leaders to the BJP
 3
 The BJP, which becomes the number two party, is very strong in West Bengal under the ruling TMC
 vahiin vipaksh kii khaali kursi par dhire-dhire hi sahi bijepi kaa kabza ho rahaa he
 BJP was the number two party in the municipal elections
 iske baad rajya kii uluberia loksabhaa or noapada vidhansabha ke upachunaav main bijepi duusare number kii party rahi
 In Uluberia where her vote 11 in the 2014 elections
 5 fisadi tha wo ab 23
 29 percent
 vaise hi noapada vidhansabha main 2016 main jahaan bijepi ko 13 fisadi vot mili the, is baar use 20
 7 percent votes were received
 is tarah bijepi kaa graph bad rahaa or left kaa kam ho rahaa he
 4
 kolkata banaam gujaratkolkata ko ek daur main desh kii audyogic rajdhani kaha jaataa tha
 Calcutta gradually lost its identity over time
 jabaki beete teen dashak main gujarat vikaas path par teji se badha
 Gujarat came to be introduced as a development model in the country under Modi rule
 isi kaa nateeja rahaa he ki jab tata ne apni naino factory ko pashchim bengal se shift karne kii baat ai to gujarat ko chunaa
 The BJP won the 2014 Lok Sabha elections over Gujarat's development model
 piem banane ke baad narendra modi ne pashchim bengal ko kai tohfe die hai
 Now it wants to establish its roots in the development model of Modi in West Bengal
 5
 bjp's focus on Bengal After winning the political battle of Tripura, BJP is eyeing West Bengal
 amit shah bijepi adhyaksh kii kaman apane haathon main lene ke baad se 18 baar pashchim bengal kaa daura kar chuke hai
 Apart from this, PM Narendra Modi has also honored the state with many gifts
 asanasol main IISCO ke aadhunik ispaat plant, kolkata or bangladesh ke khulanaa ke bich chalane vaali bandhan express train bhi shuru kii thi
 The Teesta River water agreement was also reached with Bangladesh
 iske alaava bijepi puri sakriyata se rajya par najar jamaaye hue he
 If these five factors work, then it will be easy for the BJP to make a dent in the Bengal Fort
 yahi kaaran he ki shah ke do se 22 loksabhaa siten jeetne ke daawey par ab sabaki nigahen hongi
 In Dewa Kotwali area of barabanki district of Uttar Pradesh, 11 people died after consuming poisonous liquor

 At the same time, the police have not yet confirmed the poisonous liquor
 jaanch kii ja rahi he
 In this regard, District Magistrate Akhilesh Tiwari said that three died from poisonous liquor, while the rest from cold, all the bodies are being conducted postmortem as a precaution
 iske baad hi spasht hoga ki mautjaharili sharabki vajah se hui he yaa kisi or kaaran ke chalate

 vah unka (singh kaa) sandesh pakistani netritv tak pahunchaa denge

 India can be called more Islamic than Pakistan
 ' During the conversation, Singh said that india-pakistan wants peace with its neighbors, so he will not fire first, but asked the Rangers to ensure that there is no intrusion from their side (from their land)

 He will convey his (singh's) message to the Pakistani leadership

 And both countries should unite against the threat of terrorism
 unhone kaha ki bharat musalamaanon ke sabhi 72 phirakon (sampradaayon) kaa ghar he or aisa kisi anya desh main nahin he
