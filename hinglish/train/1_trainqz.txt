 Advocacy to abolish reservation: Shankaracharya Swami Swaroopanand Saraswati has advocated the abolition of reservation from the country
 unhone kaha kiarakshanan to jati ke aadhaar par ho na hi aarthik aadhaar par balki yogyata or mehnat ke aadhaar par log tarakkee karen
 He said that when someone gets reservation, then he is unable to earn his merit
 aarakshan kii jagah yogyata par den dhyanaunhone kaha ki jo log aarakshan paakar oonche padon par pahunchate hai ve un padon ke saath nyaay nahin kar pate
 In such a situation, instead of giving reservation to the youth, efforts should be made to make them eligible

 Kodipakkam Neelameghacharya Govindacharya has plunged into politics again, staying away from party politics for nearly eight years
 koi ek dashak pehle purv pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi ko kathith taur party kaa mukhauta bataane ke baad mushkilon ne unka yun peechha kiya ki ve pehle bhaajapa main darkinar hue, phir usase baahar hi ho gaye
 He took leave for two years in the name of 'study of the effects of liberalization', then formed an institution called Rashtriya Swabhimaan Andolan and worked among the mass organizations
 pichley dinon madhya pradesh kii purv mukhyamantri uma bharti ne elaan kiya ki ve unki party ke liye kaam karenge
 When Special Correspondent Shyamlal Yadav spoke to 64-year-old Govindacharya at his office at 535, Rajendra Nagar, he said that the BJP has now become a 'saffron Congress'
 baatcheet ke anshahrajnneeti main rahanaa jaruri he, yah ehsaas hone main aath saal lag gaye?kai saal to ek vishesh taiyaari main lage
 i have not changed the way, nor have i turned back
 jab varsh 2000 main adhyayan ke liye gaya tha to bhi nayaa tarika, nayaa dhaancha, nae ladaake kii khoj main hi gaya tha
 My conclusion was that society will be ahead, power will be healthy only, society will be behind, power will be forward, then it will be annihilated
 us par main abhi bhi kaayam hum
 Intellectual, creative, agitational work was to be designed, it is now done
 tab hamane sochaa ki sajjan shakti ko rajnatik mulyon kii ore waapas laane ke liye phir se kya kiya ja saktaa he
 What do you have in mind for such a big goal? There is contact and communication of a total of six-seven hundred active groups
 yah bauddhik, rachanaatmak or andolanaatmak teenon kaamon main he
 These groups were added from place to place about the Ganges and the cow
 aapane rajnatik kadam uthaaya he to kya ye saare sanghathan bhi aapke saath abhi hai?dekhie, dow
 Lohia used to say that shovel, vote and jail are all different things
 jo fawda chalaa saktaa he, vah jaruri nahin ki vot kabad le
 i noticed that all the major parties have become us-based and minority-oriented
 sabhi mulyon or muddon se cat gaye hai
 The shape of the gang has been found in the power struggle
 uma bharti or mayawati kii kaaryastylee main khaas fark nahin dikhataa
 Why did Uma go with him? The BJP president had already announced that his party would act as the political wing of the National self-esteem Movement
 bharatparast or garibaparast banane kii sahaj sambhaavna bhaajash main vichaar ke str par he
 She wants my support
 sabhi samoohon ko jod den to kareeb 100 loksabhaa kshetron main nayaa prayog sambhav he
 If you were to enter politics again, you expressed this desire to the BJP? My assessment is that the BJP has now become a saffron Congress
 usamen chintan or charitra ke str par congress se unniis-bees kaa hi fark rah gaya he
 He is as rich as the Congress
 upie or rajg kii aarthik nitiyon main koi fark nahin he
 Shri Advani has said both inside and outside the House that policies should be more co-operative
 ek kaa tandoor cond he to duusare kaa shampen cond
 When this is the case, there is no question of looking back at the BJP
 lekin aap bahut samay tak bhaajapa main rahe hai
 What is the reason for him to deviate from this path? This thing started becoming clear from 1991
 jo nirnayakarta the, unki aasthaa isamen thi ki vichaardhaara or adarshavaad par aadhaarit party kabhi satta main nahin aa sakati
 Atal ji and Advani ji believed and believed that the parliamentary party is paramount in the parliamentary system, the organization will work as an assistant
 doosraa, ve maanate hai ki vichaardhaara se samjhauta ho, satta main aaen yahi ho saktaa he
 Otherwise, they will remain as pressure groups only
 isliye bhagava congress ho janaa unki niyati thi
 All this happened even after the control of the Sangh? See, the control of the Sangh is moral control
 1999-2000 main gambhir charchaa hui ki kya kiya ja saktaa he
 It was decided that repairs should be done
 isiilie sarkaar main rahane ke dauraan bhaajapa ko jo apyash mila, uske chhinte sangh par bhi pade
 It is being said that for the BJP, you will act like a Sangh for the BJP? The Sangh is an incomparable and unique organization
 usne desh kii seva ke liye lakhon log taiyaar kiye hai jinamein se 90 fisadi log abhi bhi satta raajnneeti se dur hai
 If i compare with the Sangh, it will be a very childish thing
 main apana kaam kar rahaa hum
 The case of you and Sanjay Joshi felt that there is a section in the BJP that does not want to let the people of the Sangh practice the party in the party? i do not know much about the case of Sanjay ji
 par bhaajapa main ek dwandv to he hi
 It starts from 1970
 aisi kaarypaddati kaa vikaas hona chahie tha jisamen saamaanya naitik aadhaar kaa vyakti bhi sidhaa chal sake or vyavastha aisi ho ki uskaa bachaav kar sake
 Failure to achieve this has been the primary problem of the BJP
 isi se tadarthwaad, hikeman samskruti, chamachaa samskruti, phir parakram ko chhodkar parikrama ko prashray, tikat bechnaa, vanshavaad, jeetne ke liye aparaadhiyon ko tikat dena-ye saare vikaar bhaajapa main isiilie aae ki chunavi jeet hi ekmaatr lakshya he
 In such a situation, what do you see the future of BJP? Its status as another political gang will continue
 jaise aaj congress gandhi se bahut dur he, samaajawaadee party lohia se bahut dur he, marxvaadi party marks se dur he, bahujan samaaj party ambedkar or kanshiram ke sapanom se bahut dur he, vaise hi, bhaajapa bhi dow
 Is far away from Hedgewar and Deendayal
 sangh khud ko bhaajapa se alag bhi kar saktaa he?sangh kaa saamaanya swayamsevak mujhe kahin udhaas dikhataa he, kahin udasin dikhataa he or kahin-kahin adatan pravaah ke saath dhire-dhire chalata dikhataa he
 This is why there is a decrease in the activism of the Sangh volunteers in many elections
 bhaajapa main duusari qatari ke netaa kaaphi aage aa chuke hai
 What possibilities do they see under his leadership? Atal ji and Advani ji have a deep affection for the Sangh due to long relations
 nae logon ke bare main nahin kaha ja saktaa ki unka koun-sa bhav swarthparak he or koun-sa samarpan aadhaarit
 a senior leader called the Ram temple movement a 'check' that had been redeemed
 ek mahaamantri hai jo mandi ke dauraan vakaalat kii kamai ke tahat ek videshi company ko saikadon kaa phayda de dete hai
 There is the party president who says one day about Sadhvi Pragya that he was just acquainted and feels embarrassed, then says that three times narco test is not good for health
 gujarat ke mukhyamantri hai jo mandir todane ko hi upkram bana chuke hai
 All this happens and people who wish to become Prime Minister remain silent
 isse saakh girti he
 Advani ji did not offer you that if you want to join politics then come to BJP? My last conversation with him was on April 3, 2005
 bhaajapa utsahit he ki adwani ji pradhanmantri banenge
 On August 15, 1998, a large section of volunteers were dreaming of Atal ji's hoisting of the flag on the Red Fort
 lekin pokaran main bam phodna hi ek uplabdhi rahi
 You failed in class eight and are getting excited by sitting in tenth exam
 grih mantri ke naate adwani or shivaraj patil main koi fark nahin rahaa

 congress mahasachiv priyanka gandhi ne pradhanmantri narendra modi ko duniya kaa sabase bada abhinayta qaraar dete hue kaha he ki isse acha to aap amitabh bachchan ko hi pradhanmantri bana dete
 During the road show in support of Congress candidate Lalitesh Tripathi in Mirzapur in Purvanchal, he said that you understand that you have made the world's biggest actor your PM, better then you would have made Amitabh Bachchan
 priyanka ke is bayaan ne saalon puraane rishton kii un paraton ko khol diya jo kaaphi dinon se dabi huin thim
 The relationship between Bachchan and Gandhi family is decades old
 isamen pandit jawahar laal nehru se lekar indira gandhi or phir rajeev gandhi bachchan parivaar ke sadasyon ke kareebi rahe
 Amitabh and Rajiv's friendship is not hidden from anyone
 kareeb do dashak se gandhi or bachchan parivaar ke rishton main chali aa rahi khatas kii charchaaon ke bich chunaav ke mausam main priyanka gandhi kii jumba par amitabh kaa naam aane iske myne talaashe ja rahe
 That too when journalist Rashid Kidwai, who has been covering Congress for a long time, dailyo
 in par likhi report main daawa kar chuke hai ki priyanka gandhi ne amitabh bachchan ke aashirwad se hi raajnneeti main utarane kaa faisla kiya
 He also met Amitabh Bachchan in a confidential meeting held in Delhi before becoming Congress General Secretary
 vah amitabh ko maamu (mamaa) kahati hai
 How close gandhi-bachchan family Gandhi and Bachchan family have been since the time of Anand Bhavan in Allahabad
 jab donon parivaar elahabaad main rahete the
 Sarojini Naidu became the link between the two families
 unhone harivansh raay bachchan or unki patni teji bachchan kaa parichay jawahar laal nehru se karaayaa tha
 Indira Gandhi was not married at that time
 iske baad se bachchan or gandhi parivaar ek duusare ke behad kareeb aate gaye
 When Rajiv was born after Indira Gandhi's marriage, he later became friends with Amitabh Bachchan, two years older
 is prakaar yah dosti peedi dar peedi aage badhati chali gai
 While Prime Minister, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru lived in Teen Murti Bhawan in New Delhi
 unke ghar ke daravaaje hameshaa rajeev ke dost amitabh or unke bhai ajitabh ke liye khule rahete the
 amitabh-ajitabh and Rajiv gandhi-sajay Gandhi used to play with each other in Teen Murti Bhavan
 samay ke saath rishte bhi pragadh hote chale
 In 1983, when Amitabh Bachchan was seriously injured during the shooting of the film 'coolie', Indira Gandhi Hospital came to take care of him while he was Prime Minister
 donon pariwaron main najdiki ke yun to kai kisse hai
 But one example is more special
 shaadi se pehle jab sonia gandhi bharat ain to indira gandhi ne bachchan parivaar ke saath unke thaharne kaa intjaam kiya
 Indeed, Indira Gandhi intended that it would help Sonia, who grew up in foreign customs, to learn the Indian rites
 kareeb 43 dinon tak sonia gandhi bachchan parivaar ke saath raheen
 Amitabh's mother Teji Bachchan taught him all the methods while keeping him as a daughter
 is prakaar sonia bhi bachchan parivaar main ghul-mil gayi
 How the relationship deteriorated? There were many reasons behind the rift in the close relationship between Gandhi and the Bachchan family
 shuruyaat immergency se hui
 When Indira Gandhi was strictly enforcing all the rules
 bollywood par bhi iskaa asar pad rahaa tha
 Then Amitabh Bachchan was silent
 jis par unki aalochana shuru ho gai thi
 At this time, Amitabh Bachchan started making some distance from the Gandhi family
 haalanki jab indira gandhi kii hatya hui to uske baad congress or desh chalaane kii jimmedaari rajeev gandhi ke kandhon par aa padi
 At that time, Rajiv Gandhi convinced his celebrity friend Amitabh Bachchan to enter politics to face the opposition
 rajeev gandhi ke kehane par amitabh bachchan elahabaad se diggaj netaa hemavanti nandan bahuguna ke khilaaf chunaav lade or jite bhi
 In the Bofors scam, the opposition started raising the issue of Bofors scandal loudly
 amitabh bachchan kaa bhi naam isamen uchhalane laga
 This incident shook Amitabh Bachchan
 unhen kanoonee ladaai bhi ladani padi
 Amitabh Bachchan gave up the idea of wandering in the streets of politics after his name cropped up in the Bofors scandal
 patrkaar raashid kidawai kii kitaab 'netaa-abhinayta bollywood star power in indian politics' main bhi bachchan or gandhi parivaar ko lekar puure ek chapter main kai rochak kisse darj hai
 It is said that after the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi in 1991, Sonia Gandhi hoped that she would be supported by the Bachchan family, but the level of Amitabh Bachchan, who had left politics, did not help her personally either
 raashid kidawai ne donon pariwaron ke bich rishte kharaab hone ke liye ek pramukh ghatana kaa kitaab main zikr kiya he
 According to this incident, Priyanka and Robert Vadra were to be married on 18 February 1997
 magar is bich amitabh bachchan kii beti shweta kii shaadi ek din pehle 17 farvari ko tay ho gai
 According to Rashid Kidwai, there was a lot of discussion in the Congress about one day back and forth of the wedding dates
 donon pariwaro main rishte bigadane kii baat tab or saarvajanik hui, jab 2007 main teji bachchan kaa nidhan hone par gandhi parivaar se koi sadsy antim sanskaar ke vakt shaamil nahin hua
 After being away from the Amitabhagandhi family, who was close to Modi, the Bachchan family ever came close to the Samajwadi Party through Amar Singh
 jaya bachchan aaj bhi sapa se rajyasabha saansad hai
 As such, Amitabh Bachchan does not belong to any party
 magar narendra modi ke gujarat main mukhyamantri rahane ke dauraan unhone rajya ke brands ambesader ke taur par kai vigyaapan kiye
 On the completion of two years of Modi government, Amitabh Bachchan's special presence was also seen in the program organized at India Gate on 28 May 2016
 isse siyaasi galiyare main yah sandesh gaya ki big bi or narendra modi ke bich kaaphi karibiyaan hai
 In the day the market is held in every city of the country, but you will be surprised to know that in the midnight market in Kolkata, where you can buy old clothes at very cheap prices

 puraane kapade kharidne ke liye bihar se bazaar aae raghu pandey kehete hai ki in kapadon ko vah dhokar waapas bech dete hai
 Pandey said, 'I have been coming to this market for the last twenty years
 main kapade kharidta hum or unhen apane gaanv or padosi ilaakon main bech detaa hum
 'he said,' If i buy a jeans for a hundred rupees, then i wash it and sell it in my village for 130 rupees
 isse main apane chah sadasyeey parivaar ko paalane ke liye paryaapt paisa kama letaa hum
 'nobody knows the real age of this market but senior people claim that it is almost 70 years old
 maheene main ek baar is bazaar main aane vaale tripura ke jatin sarkaar ne kaha, ‘koi bhi bazaar kii asal umr nahin bataa saktaa
 My grandfather used to come here in the early fifties
 ’is bazaar main kaamkaaj to saalon se chalaa aa rahaa he lekin dur daraaj ilaakon se aane vaale dukandaaron ko is baat kii chintaa he ki yahaan khaane ke liye koi jagah nahin he
 Abdul Mondal of Murshidabad said, 'we have been asked by the money-collecting market welfare committee to build some food houses but till now our demand has not received any attention
 ’is baat kaa jawaab dene ke liye bazaar kalyaan samiti kaa koi sadsy uplabdh nahin ho sakaa
 Kolkata Municipal Corporation officials say they have no information about this market
 bazaar se jude ek adhikari (meyar in council ke sadsy) tarak singh ne kaha, ‘mujhe is bazaar kii jaankaree nahin he lekin ab aapane mujhe bataaya he to main is maamle ko dekhuunga

 Today is the 143rd birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, India's first home minister, who tied the country in one thread
 is maukey parasardaar patelki duniya kii sabase oonchi murti 'stachu of unity' (statue Of Unity) kaa buudhvaar ko pradhanmantrinarendra modidesh ko samarpit kiya
 Congress leader Akhilesh Pratap Singh said in the discussion of Aaj Tak that Narendra Modi never used to name Mahatma Gandhi, Sardar Patel, and Abul Kalam Azad while he was the CM of Gujarat and no one has seen him visiting the monuments
 unhone kaha ki modiji der, aae durast aae
 If he is now at the national level, his compulsion is to take the names of Gandhi and Sardar Patel
 haalanki sardaar patel ne hi aresas par pratibandh lagaaya tha
 The Congress leader said that Sardar Patel's contribution cannot be forgotten
 vahiin, basapa supremeo mayawati ne sardaar vallabh bhai patel kii ‘stachu of unity’naam kii pratimaa banaae jane par modi sarkaar kii aalochana kii he
 Mayawati said that BJP and RSS & Company should apologize to the people of the society
 mayawati ne aage kaha ki bijepi pehle baba sahab doctor ambedkar sahit daliton or anya pichde varg ke mahaan santon, guruon or mahapurushon ke sammaan main bispi dwaara banaai gai murtiyon, bhawanon, sthalon, smarakon or parkon ko phijulkharchi bataa kar isaki aalochana karte the
 The same BJP is now showing respect and respect to Prime Minister Narendra Modi by spending around ₹ 3000 crores on Sardar Patel's Statue of Unity
 vahiin, bijepi ne arapy singh ne kaha ki desh kii ekta or akhandata ko banaae rakhane sardaar patel kii shakhsiyat ko chunaav ke saath nahin joda janaa chahie
 Modi ji has honored the spirit of the people of the country by installing his statue
 bijepi chunaav main iskaa phayda nahin uthaaegi ke sawaal par unhone kaha ki jab koi sandarbh aayega to charchaa hogi
 If Sardar Patel has played an important role in the country, then of course he will be discussed
 varisht patrkaar ashutosh ne kaha ki aresas or bijepi ke paas koi aitihaasik cheharaa nahin he
 The BJP should not forget that Sardar Patel has been associated with the Congress till the last moment
 unhone kaha ki bijepi aaj nehru kaa apmaan kar patel ko upar kar rahi he
 Whereas Gandhiji used to say that Nehru and Patel are people who will take the country forward
 ashutosh ne kaha ki nehru-patel ke rishte usee tarah se hai, jis prakaar se bijepi ke atal bihari vaajapeyi or laalkrishna adwani ke bich the
 He said that after Gandhi's death Patel himself said that now our leader is Nehru
 ashutosh ne kaha ki sardaar patel aaj hote to sangh or bijepi netaa ko fatkaar lagaate
 Javadekar's counterattack After the Congress said it was a compulsion to name Sardar Patel, the Union Minister Prakash Javadekar retorted that the Prime Minister has unveiled the grand statue of Sardar Patel

 BJP President Amit Shah has been engaged in preparations for 2019 since long
 agle teen maheenon ke liye party ne jabardast yojana taiyaar kii he
 BJP has started preparing vigorously for the Lok Sabha elections 2019
 party ne ek rodmap taiyaar kiya he, jiske mutabik agle teen maheenon main 22 karod logon se sampark kiya jayega
 PM Narendra Modi and Amit Shah, while addressing a meeting of the members of the National Working Committee of all the cells of the party last week, emphasized that all the disadvantaged sections of society should be connected before the elections
 sutron ke mutabik khaskar is baat ke liye prayaas kiya jayega ki virdohi dalon dwaara bijepi kii jo dalit, alpsankhyak, kisaan or mahila virdohi chhavi banaai ja rahi he use sakhti se khaarij kiya jaae or aise kaam kiye jaaen jisase is chhavi main badlaav aa sake
 The two leaders therefore specifically asked the leaders of Dalit, Women, Farmers, Minority Cells to go among the people to solve their problems and ask for suggestions, so that the party can find a way to solve their problems
 sutron ke anusaar pehali baar aisa hua he ki bijepi ke sabhi saaton prakoshthon ke netaaon kii baithak hui he jise modi or shah donon ne sambodhit kiya ho
 a senior party leader says that such an effort will enable the BJP to improve its organizational structure before the Lok Sabha elections
 is baithak main party kii mahila morcha, alpsankhyak morcha, essi morcha, asti morcha, yuva morcha, kisaan morcha or obisi morcha ke rashtriya kaaryakarini ke sadsy shaamil hue the
 Significantly, if there is a BJP or BJP coalition government in 20 states of the country, it is due to the strategic skill of its leaders and the aggressive work of the party president Amit Shah ahead of time
 bijepi kii aakraamakata or party kaaryakartaaon kii mehnat kaa muqabla agar vipaksh nahin kar paata he, to mahaj tamaam dalon kaa ek kunba bana lene se bahut fark nahin padane vaala
 So while all the parties are celebrating Karnataka's Keejeet, meanwhile, the BJP has quietly prepared the road ahead and in the next three months it will reach out to 22 crore people and try to make them their own

 Even though Rahul Gandhi did not make any such statement, but now the Chief Minister of his party in Madhya Pradesh is preparing to make this formula come true

 However, the Congress alleged that some parts of Rahul's statement have been cut and misrepresented
 sansad kaa sheetakaaleen satr shuru hua to sabase adhik charchaa jiesti vidheyak ko lekar rahi
 There was a round of discussion between the power and the opposition to support and negotiate the bill, but even after talks between the government and the Congress on Monday, the hopes of getting an agreement on it seem bleak
 vitt mantri arun jetali pehle himaujuuda sansad satrake bekaar chale jane kii ashanka jataa chuke hai
 The deadlock persists even after Jaitley held talks with Congress leaders to iron out differences on the issue of GST Bill

 It is also a matter of deliberation that only seven days are left in the end of the winter session

 Congress demanded another meeting, citing Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge out of Delhi in the Lok Sabha, Congress leaders demanded another meeting, which the government gladly accepted
 anand sharma ne bataaya, 'aaj kii baatcheet adhuri rahi
 working in progress
 aaj koi silsilewar baatcheet nahin hui
 Negotiations between the government and the opposition cannot be limited to just one issue
 18 maheene tak vipaksh se baatcheet nahin karne ke baad sarkaar ab ek vidheyak ko lekar hamase bas ek vidheyak par baatcheet karne ko lekar pareshaan hai
 The government should not be so worried about just one bill, because other important bills are also pending
 congress ne piem modi par lagaaya aropcongress netaaon ne is maukey par pradhanmantri modi par nishaanaa saadhaa or kaha ki upie sarkaar ke kaarykaal ke dauraan paanch varshon tak gujarat ke tatkaaleen mukhyamantri jo ab desh ke pradhanmantri hai, ke virodh ke kaaran yah vidheyak paarit nahin ho paaya tha
 Amid the deadlock over GST, Arun Jaitley wrote in a Facebook post, 'the last session of Parliament did not take place

 The reason for not being allowed to work in the current session is changing every hour
 ' unhone congress ko sansad ke madhyam se desh ke shashan kii saansadon kii jimmedaari yaad dilaane ke liye pandit jawahar laal nehru ke ek bhaashan kaa ullekh bhi kiya
 From here onwards, from here onwards, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Naidu said, 'I am disappointed to see that they are looking for some excuse to disrupt Parliament
 ham mahatvapurn muddon or vidheyakon par charchaa nahin kar paa rahe hai
 On the other hand, Sharma hit back at these acts and said that we are not changing every now and then

 The latest case has surfaced in Nashik, Maharashtra

 congress ne assam main kargil yuddh ladane vaale sena ke sevanivrutt adhikari mohammad sanoullah ko videshi ghoshit karne par tikhi pratikriya di
 The Congress alleges that this action taken under the NRC process is an insult to the sacrifice of the soldiers
 party pravaktaa randeep surajevaala ne twit karke kaha, 'ascharyajanak! bijepi sarkaar ne kargil yuddh ke nayak ko 'videshi' ghoshit kar diya
 It is an insult to the sacrifice of military forces
 yah is baat ko sabit karata he ki enarasi ko assam main kis had tak galat tareeke se lagu kiya gaya he
 'shocking !! BJP Govt has labeled the' Foreigner 'tag to a Kargil War Hero! It is an insult to the sacrifice of our brave Armed Forces
 This speaks volumes about the high handedness & flawed manner in which the NRC exercise is being implemented in Assam

 ) samajasevi anna hajaare ne gandhi jayanti ke maukey par rajghat par satyagrah par baithe
 Anna Hazare said that even after 6 years, Jan Lokpal has not come
 modi sarkaar bhrashtachar ko rokane main fail he or janalokapal va lokayukta ko lekar gambhir nahin he
 Anna Hazare said that corruption is the only reason for the general public's misery and if the government does not take steps in this direction, then from December or January next year, they will again go to the field to fight
 anna hajaare ne kaha ki bhrashtachar ke kaaran garib or amir main antar bad rahaa he
 i have been agitating for 35 years, there is not a single party against which i have not agitated
 anna ne kaha ki RTI kaa kanoon hamane banaaya, usase fark aayaa he
 i have been fighting the Lokpal battle for 6 years, that government also assured us
 anna ne kaha ki bijepi vipachh main rahete hue lokapal kaa samarthan kiya tha, lekin teen saal se satta main rahane ke baad kuch kiya nahin
 Anna said that 70 years of India's independence has passed, but the dreams of our freedom fighters have not been fulfilled yet
 unhone kaha, main rajghat par gandhi ji ko naman karne aayaa hum
 There is a reason for being upset today
 anna ne kaha ki dukhi nahi hu, dukhi swaarthee log hote hai
 Anna said, Gandhiji's dream was not fulfilled
 anna hajaare somvaar ko subah pune se dilli aae or sidhe gandhi samadhi rajghat pahunche, jahaan anna hajaare baapu ko shradhanjali diya
 Anna Hazare said on Sunday that the country had lost its way to Mahatma Gandhi's dream
 isiilie vah gandhi jayanti ke maukey par ek din kaa satyagrah karenge
 In view of this, on Monday, Anna Hazare reached Samadhi and started Satyagraha
 darasal pichley dinon anna hajaare ne pradhanmantri narendra modi ko letters likhakar bhrashtachar or kisaanon kii samasyaon par apni naaraazgi jaahir kii thi or andolan karne kii bhi baat kahi thi
 Anna wrote in the letter that even after six years of his agitation, not a single law preventing corruption could be implemented
 lokapal, lokayuktaki niyukti karne vaale or bhrashtachar ko rokanevaale sabhi shashakt bilon par sarkaar susti dikhaa rahi he
 The Swaminathan Commission report on the problems of farmers is also not being implemented
 sarkaar ke is ravaie se naaraaz anna hajaare ne letters main tamaam masalon ke bare main likhaa tha or ab koi jawaab nahin milane par dilli main andolan karne kii bhi baat kahi thi
 It has been 6 years since Anna Hazare of the movement had organized a movement in Ramlila Maidan in 2011 to create a corruption-free India
 iske baad 27 agast 2011 ke din bhartiya sansad main ‘sense of the House’ se rigyulation paas kiya gaya tha
 In this, the Lokpal at the Center, the Lokayukta and Citizen's Charter in every state were decided to enact laws on such important issues at the earliest
 iske baad anna hajaare ne apana andolan sthagit kar diya tha
 6 years have passed since this
 anna ne kaha ki pichhali centre sarkaar ne 2013 main hi lokapal vidheyak paarit kar diya tha or bhartiya janata party ke netaaon ne tab uskaa samarthan kiya tha, lekin teen varsh baad bhi is kanoon ko lagu nahin kiya gaya, jo modi kii udaseenta ko jaahir karata he,'bijepi ne nahin nibhaayaa apana vaada'anna hajaare ne modi ko likhe gaye letters main kaha ki lokapal or lokayukta kanoon banate samay sansad ke dono sadanon main vipaksh kii bhoomika nibhaa rahi bijepi ne bhi is kanoon ko pura samarthan diya tha
 After this, your party formed a government in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 lokapal andolan ke baad desh kii janata ne badi ummid se aapke netritv main nai sarkaar ko chunaa tha
 At the same time it was necessary to give sufficient time to the new government to implement the issues
 anna hajaare ne pichley teen saalon main kai baar patr likhane kaa zikr bhi kiya, lekin piemo se koi jawaab nahin mila
 Not only this, the Lokpal and Lokayukta were mentioned in Mann Ki Baat
 unhone likhaa he ki satta main aane se pehle aapane aashwaasan diya tha ki bhrashtachar mukt bharat banaaenge
 However, you could not appoint Lokpal and Lokayukta for 3 years
 supreme court ne bhi aapaki sarkaar ko baar-baar fatkaar lagaai he
 It is clear from this that you are not showing the will to implement the Lokpal, Lokayukta law
 kisaanon kii samasya par bhi nahin diya javadhanna hajaare ne desh main lagaatarkisaanon kii aatmahatyaka bhi zikr kiya he
 According to Anna, at the present time, farmers received a price-based price in the farming yields, so i wrote several times
 haalanki na aapaki taraf se koi jawaab aayaa or na hi swaminathan kamity kii report par karrwai hui
 For this reason, farmers have been agitating in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Haryana, Rajasthan for the last several days
 saath hi letters main anna ne rajnatik partiyon ko soochna ke adhikaar ke daayre main laane kii maang bhi kii
 Now Anna Hazare said through the letter that in the last 3 years your government has not responded to any letter
 iske liye ab maine dilli main andolan karne kaa nirnay liya he
 i will continue the agitation in Delhi till the right decision and implementation in public interest on the issues written in the letter
 anna hajaare ne agle patr main andolan kii taarikh kii ghoshnaa karne kii baat kahi thi
 This is the reason why his Satyagraha is being observed on the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti
 pakistan ek ladkhadta hua desh he, desh main ho rahe ghatnakram america or dakshin asia kshetra ke liye achche nahin hai
 An eminent American foreign policy expert has said this
 bucralin institute main videsh niti adhyayan kii shodharthi vainda felbaab-brown ne kaha, pakistan ek ladkhdaata hua desh he, or efeetie (sangheey prashasit kabaili ilaaka) se itar, visheshkar punjab main, desh ke moulik rup se ladkadaane jaise ghatnakram kshetra or america ke liye bure honge
 Brown said, "we have to watch very carefully how we will benefit from the actions taken in Pakistan in the context of the Afghan environment
" hamen dekhnaa hoga ki inkaa pakistan par kya prabhaav padataa he or mujhe acchhee tarah pataa he ki pakistan hamaare saath khel khel rahaa he
 It is like he says that if you take more aggressive action then we are weak because of this we will break
 isse ham aisa karne se pehle sanyamit ho jate hai
 The comments unhone kaha ki pakistan buree tarah se kamjor he or desh main shaayad hi kuch acha ho rahaa he
 Brown said, so unfortunately we have to focus more deeply on the Durand Line and on Pakistan

 brown ne kaha, hamen bahut hi dhyaan se dekhnaa hoga ki hamen afgani parivesh ke sandarbh main pakistan main kii jane vaali karravaayiyon se kitna phayda hoga
 We have to see what effect they have on Pakistan and i am well aware that Pakistan is playing a game with us
 yah aisa he jaise vah kehete hai ki agar aap zyada aakraamak karrwai karte hai to ham kamjor hai is vajah se ham tut jaaenge
 This allows us to be restrained before doing so
 tippaniyan He said that Pakistan is badly vulnerable and hardly anything good is happening in the country
 brown ne kaha, isliye durbhagyavash hamen duurand rekha ke paar or pakistan par or zyada gaharaai se dhyaan dena pad rahaa hai

 aaj caitra navaratri kaa saatvaan din he
 It is also known as Mahasaptami
 aaj ke din maa durga ke saatven swaroop yani maa kaalaratri kii puja kii jaati he
 It is believed that worshiping Maa Kalratri, along with removing the fear of the person, also cures all problems
 bataa den, devi kaa ye rup riddhi siddhi pradaan karne vaala he
 In such a situation, let us know what is the right method of worshiping Maa Kalratri, by which all the problems of humans are removed
 aisa he maa kaalaratri kaa saatvaan swaroop-- maa kaalaratri navadurga kaa saatvaan swarup hai
 - This form of Maa Durga is quite terrible
 - inkaa rang kaala he or ye teen netradhari hai
 - There is a wonderful garland of electricity in the neck of Maa Kalratri
 - maa ke haathon main khadg or kanta he or inkaa vaahan gadhaa he
 -but they always provide welfare to their devotees, hence they are also called Shubhankari
 ye haima kaalaratri kii puja kii sahi vidhi-- maa ke samaksh sabase pehle ghi kaa deepak jalaaen
 - Then offer red flowers to the mother, as well as offer jaggery
 - bhoga lagane ke baad maa ke mantron kaa jaap karen yaa phir aap saptshati kaa paath bhi kar sakate hai
 Distribute half of jaggery in the family, donate the remaining half of jaggery to a Brahmin
 - kaale rang ke vastra dhaaran karke yaa kisi ko nuksaan panhuchane ke uddeshy se puja na karen
 Many beliefs about the form of Maa Kali - According to astrology and religion experts, Maa Kali and Kalratri are not the same
 unke anusaar maa kaalaratri, navadurga kaa ek swarup he jabaki maa kaali das mahavidhya kaa rup he
 These benefits are due to the worship of Maa Kalratri - to control enemies and opponents, their worship is very auspicious
 - bhay,durghatana or rogon kaa naash hota he
 - Mother Kalratri protects against the influence of negative forces
 - jyotish main shani ko niyantrit karne ke liye inaki puja achook maani jaati he
 Do these remedies to calm enemies - Wear white or red clothes and worship Maa Kalratri at night
 - maa ke saamne deepak jalaaen or unhen gud kaa bhoga lagaaein- iske baad 108 baar navarn mantra kaa jaap karen or har mantra ke saath ek laung chadhaate jaaen
 - The Navarna Mantra is - "ॐ क्ली क्ली क्ली क्ली च च ु ु ु ु ु ु ु ु ु ु ु" -makar or kumbh raashi ke jaatakon ko kaalaratri kii puja jarur kerani chahie
 - If you are in trouble, offer 7 lemon garlands to the goddess
 -saptami kii raatri til yaa sarson ke tel kii akhand jyoti jalaaen
 The Shiv Sena has strongly criticized the Congress over the news of giving a big donation in the name of rally through Saamana
 darasal maharashtra congress adhyaksh maanik raav thakare or purv mantri satish chaturvedi ke bich hui baatcheet se yah khulaasa hua he ki maharashtra main sonia gandhi kii raily ke liye vahaan ke mukhyamantri or mantriyon ko motaa chanda dena padaa
 During a press conference in Nagpur just a day before Sonia Gandhi's rally, Manik Rao Thackeray and former minister were heard talking about the expenses incurred in the rally
 ye donon netaa jab aapas main baat kar rahe the to vahaan camera or mike on tha or donon kii baatcheet record ho gai
 On the other hand, Sonia Gandhi is holding a rally in Wardha, Maharashtra today
 sonia kii aaj honevaali is raily ko lekar maharashtra congress ne khub taiyaari kii he
 But the way the Chief Minister and Ministers are raising money for the rally, the color of the rally may fade
 vaise reliyon ke naam par moti ugaahi karne kaa maamla koi nayaa nahin he lekin vipaksh ko congress par hamalaa karne kaa mauka to mil hi gaya he
 Australia defeated India 3–2 on the basis of a penalty shootout in the third Test match played at the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Stadium on Monday to clinch the three-match series 2–0
 nirdhaarit samay kii samaapti tak bharat ne yah match 3-2 se jeeta tha, lekin siries kiske naam hogi, iskaa faisla penalty shootout se hona tha
 The reason for this was that both teams had scored six goals in this series and both had won one match each
 aise main siries ke vijeta kaa faisla karne ke liye shootout aprihaary ho gaya tha
 In the stipulated time, India had the advantage of converting the first penalty corner into a goal
 bharat ke liye yah gol viaar raghunatha ne 17wein minute main kiya tha
 After this, in the 36th minute, Trent Mitton scored an excellent field goal, bringing his team on par
 match kaa teesraa or bharat kaa doosraa gol rupinder paal singh ne penalty corner par kiya
 With this, India took the lead
 yah gol 41wein minute main hua, lekin trent miton ne 54wein minute main field gol kiya or apni team ko barabari par laa diya
 Australia would have won the series 1–0 if the match ended in a tie, as they had won the second match played in Raipur
 bharat ko shaayad yah manjuur nahin tha
 He intensified his attacks
 isi kamr main akashadip singh ne antim minute main ek behtareen gol kar apni team ko 3-2 se jeet dilaa di, lekin siries kiske naam hogi, iskaa faisla penalty shootout se hona tha or isamen austrailia ne baaji maar lee
 One of the two goals scored by India during the shootout was on a penalty stroke, but Raghunath could not score a goal on the second penalty stroke by Dharamvir Singh
 agar raghunatha yah gol kar lete to phir donon tiimon ko ek-ek mauka or miltaa or aisi sthiti main kuch bhi ho saktaa tha
 The first match played between the two teams at Rajnandgaon on 19 November was a 2-2 draw
 iske baad raipur main khelaa gaya doosraa muqabla austrailia ne 2-1 se jeeta tha
 The special thing is that in the first match at Rajnandgaon and Raipur, the Indian team had a lead at one time, but due to its poor performance at the last time, Australia drew the first match and won the second match
 yah siries donon tiimon ke liye kaaphi ahm thi
 Before the Hockey World League (HWL) to be held here from November 27, both got a chance to take stock of the preparations and also got success in the atmosphere of Raipur
 tippaniyan This series was especially important for Australia, as she is now fully in the Raipur season and is ready to save the title, but the collision with India forced her to once again keep a close eye on her preparations
 is
 bharat ne austrailia jaisi shashakt team ko kabhi bhi itnaa pareshaan nahin kiya tha
 a total of 8 teams including India and Australia will participate in HWL
 lig ke pehle sanskaran kaa khitaab austrailia ne jeeta tha
 The first edition was held in New Delhi
 nirdhaarit samay main bharat ne pehle penalty corner ko gol main badalte hue badhat hasil kii thi
 The goal for India was scored by VR Raghunath in the 17th minute
 iske baad 36wein minute main trent miton ne ek behtareen field gol karte hue apni team ko barabari par laa diya
 The third of the match and India's second goal was scored by Rupinder Pal Singh at penalty corner
 iske saath bharat ne badhat banaai
 The goal took place in the 41st minute, but Trent Mitton scored a field goal in the 54th minute to put his team on par
 match barabari par samaapt hone kii sthiti main austrailia yah siries 1-0 se jeet letaa, kyonki usne raipur main khele gaye duusare match main jeet hasil kii thi
 India probably did not approve of this
 usne apane hamale tej kar die
 It was in this battle that Akashdeep Singh scored a brilliant goal in the final minute to give his team a 3–2 victory, but the name of the series was to be decided by a penalty shootout and Australia won it
 bharat kii ore se shootout ke dauraan jo do gol hue unamem se ek penalty stroke par hua, lekin dharmaveer singh dwaara hasil duusare penalty stroke par raghunatha gol nahin kar sake
 If Raghunath had scored this goal, then both the teams would have got one chance each and in such a situation anything could have happened
 donon tiimon ke bich rajanandgaanv main 19 navambar ko khelaa gaya pehla muqabla 2-2 kii barabari par chuta tha
 After this, the second match played in Raipur was won by Australia 2–1
 khaas baat yah he ki rajanandgaanv or raipur main hue pehle match main bhartiya team ek samay badhat liye hue thi, lekin antim samay main uske lachar pradarshan ke kaaran austrailia ne pehla match drow kiya or doosraa match jeet liya
 This series was very important for both the teams
 yahaan 27 november se hone vaale hockey world lig (echdbluel) se pehle donon ko taiyaari kaa jayja lene kaa mauka mila or saath hi raipur ke maahaul main dhalane main safalataa mili
 The comments khaastaur par yah siries austrailia ke liye kaaphi ahm rahi, kyonki vah ab raipur ke mausam main puri tarah dhal chuki he or khitaab bachaane ke liye taiyaar he, lekin bharat se mili takkar ne use apni taiyaariyon par ek baar phir paini najar daalane par majaboor kiya he
 India has never bothered a strong team like Australia
 echdbluel main bharat or austrailia sahit kul 8 timen hissaa lengi
 The first edition of the league was won by Australia
 pehle sanskaran kaa aayojan nai dilli main hua tha
 The third of the match and India's second goal was scored by Rupinder Pal Singh at penalty corner

 Body Language: These 15 Mistakes Are Enough to Fail bhaajapa-shivasena gathbandhan ko loksabhaa chunaav main banpar jeet mili
 The alliance got a total of 41 seats
 inamen se bhaajapa ko 23 siton par jeet mili, jabaki shivasena 18 seat apni jholii main daalane main safal rahi
 However, in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, this alliance got 42 seats
 is baar usase ek seat kam mili
 After the implementation of Maratha reservation in the state, the alliance was expecting the support of Maratha voters, but there was also the possibility of OBC voters losing out
 jab loksabhaa chunaav 2019 ke parinaam saamne aae to yah saaf ho gaya ki obisi ke vot bade paimaane par bhaajapa ko mili
 Apart from Maratha vote, tribal vote also went in support of BJP

 mana ja rahaa tha ki 16 fisadi maratha aarakshan ke baad obisi matadaataaon main asuraksha kii bhaavana aa gai he or ve bhaajapa se naaraaz hai
 But 66 per cent of obcs voted in favor of bjp-shiv Sena and only 28 per cent in favor of congress-ncp
 obasi votaron ne vanchit aghadi party se munh mode liya
 Prakash Ambedkar's underprivileged Bahujan Aghadi Party and Asaduddin Owaisi's party got only 3 per cent OBC votes
 dalit muslim vot kahaan gaevanchit bahujan aghadi ko daliton kaa puraa samarthan mila
 He got 35 per cent Dalit votes

 Rita Bahuguna Joshi, who left the Congress's hand and joined the BJP, has objected to calling herself opportunistic

 'rita Bahuguna Joshi said that look at the situation of UP leaders
 congress ke tikat bhi sattadhari party ke ichha anusaar baante jate the
 Who made so much wealth in UP

 In the last 22 years, i also lost my house, those who had nothing became their palaces
 unhone kaha ki kuch netaa party kaa haath marodakar, use daraa dhamkaakar rajya sabha main baith gaye hai
 People who are making personal gains from contracting to pledging the party call me opportunistic

 Professor GD Agarwal, who dedicated his life to the avidity of the Ganges, went to meet Union Minister Uma Bharti recently to talk to him and also spoke to the Minister for River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation
 lekin professor agarwal ne ganga act lagu hone tak anshan jari rakhane kii baat kahi thi

 is
 iske tahat sabhi bairaj ko nirdesh die gaye hai ki unhen saal bhar kis tarah se ganga main pani chhodana he taaki ganga kaa pravaah nirantar bana rahe or ganga ko aviral banaae rakhane ke saath hi nirmal bhi banaaya ja sake

 Congress President Rahul Gandhi on Thursday expressed grief over the death of environmental activist GD Agarwal and said that he gave up his life for the river Ganges

 "former Union Environment Minister and senior Congress leader Jairam Ramesh, while terming the death of Professor Agarwal as a martyr, said that he was a tireless warrior not only of Nirmal Ganga but also of the Aviraal Ganga
 ye meraa saubhaahgya tha ki ganga kii aviralata sunishchit karne ke liye uttarakhand main ganga kii sahaayak nadiyon par unke mashware ko lagu karne kaa avasar mila

 Did Kailash Vijayvargiya, like his son Akash Vijayvargiya, ever beat up an officer? Akash Vijayvargiya, son of BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya, battered a municipal officer in Indore with a bat
 iske baad unhen giraftaar karke nyaayik hiraasat main jail bhej diya gaya he
 An old, black and white photo has gone viral on social media after Akash went to jail
 is photo main kailash vijayawargeey haath main juuta liye thodi aakraamak mudra main dikh rahe hai
 The shoe is looking slightly closer to the man standing in front
 uske saath ek police vaala or kuch anya log bhi khadey hai
 This photo is claimed to be 'kailash Vijayvargiya ASP attacking Pramod Falnikar'
 is photo par log vyangyatmak tippaniyan kar rahe hai ki nigam adhikari par bat se hamalaa karke akaash vijayawargeey ne vahi kiya he jo unhone apane pita se siikhaa he
 Apart from social media, many media institutions have also run such reports about this photo, which makes it appear that Kailash had picked up a shoe on the officer
 india today ke anti phek news war room ne (AFWA) is photo kii tah tak jaakar pataa kiya to is 25 saal puraani photo kii kahani saamne ai
 The real story is something else
 na to adhikari par hamalaa hua tha, na hi kailash vijayawargeey ne unhen dhamkaaya tha
 Who is the man who was allegedly attacked? Actually, the man on whom Kailash Vijayvargiya is seen running the shoe is Pramod Shripad Falnikar, a 1989 batch IPS officer of Madhya Pradesh cadre
 philhal ve enesji main bataur aiji nai dilli main posted hai
 Falnikar has worked long hours in different departments in Madhya Pradesh
 kya is photo se chhedchhad hui?nahin, is photo se koi chhedchhad nahin hui he
 It was pulled in 1994
 ise indore ke ek sandhya akhbaar 'prabhaat kiran' ke photographer ne khinchi thi
 The man who has a shoe in his hand is Kailash Vijay class
 ve us vakt indore ke vidhayak the
 The policeman seen in the uniform in the photo is Arun Jain, who was in charge of Tukoganj police station at that time
 pramod shripad phalnikar, jisase vijayawargeey baat karte dikh rahe hai ve us samay indore main eespi (city) the
 Did Kailash commit indecency with Falnikar? We talked to Falnikar about this incident
 unhone conform kiya ki photo main jo aadmi dikh rahaa he, vah ve khud hi hai
 Recalling the 25-year-old incident, he said that at that time there was a water problem in Pardesipura area
 kailash vijayawargeey samarthakon ke saath mumbai-agra haive par chakkaa jam kar rahe the
 As ASP, i went there and convinced them to end the picket
 maine unase yah vaada kiya tha ki main nigam kamishnar se baat karuunga or samasya kaa nidaan ho jayega
 They agreed and the blockade jammed out
 'phalnikar kaa kahana he ki haalanki, pani kii samasya kuch din baad bhi khatm nahin hui
 Then we came to know that Vijayvargiya and his supporters have decided to encircle the senior corporation officer
 hamane unke ghar kii suraksha badhaai or maukey par pahunchaa
 i started convincing Vijayvargiya not to march
 phalnikar ne bataaya, 'mujhe acchhee tarah yaad he ki photo main jo puliceman dikh rahaa he, vah thana prabharee arun jain hai
 "this was the time when Vijayvargiya took off his shoe and showed me, saying - We had finished the picket that day at your behest
 municipal offis ke chakkar laga laga kar hamaare juute ghis gaye par kuch hua nahin
 Now they will have to go and talk to their house
 ”phalnikar ne bataaya ki “jis samay ve apana juuta dikhaa rahe the usee samay 'prabhaat kiran' ke photographer ne photo clic kar lee
 Since then, this photo has been circulated many times and has created unnecessary controversy
 ”phalnikar jor dekar kehete hai ki kisi bhi samay vijayawargeey ne unhen dhamkaaya nahin, kyonki unka gussa to nigam adhikariyon par tha, na ki mujh par
 Secondly, in the photo you can see how the policeman is standing comfortably
 “agar koi vidhayak pulisavaale ke adhikari ke saath abhadrata kar rahaa hota to pulisavaala kuch na kuch pratikriya de rahaa hota, vah itane aaraam se to nahin khadaa hota
 "to further confirm this incident, we tried to contact the photographer of 'prabhat Kiran' who took this photo
 haalanki, hamaara unase sampark nahin ho paaya
 If they are contacted and get their response then it will be updated in the story
 baharhaal, jab akaash vijayawargeey kii kahani sabko pataa he, usee samay soshal media or kuch media santhaan bhi ek aise photo ke jhaanse main aa gaye hai jo prathamdrishtya kuch or kahani kah rahi he, lekin uske peeche kii kahani kuch or he

 Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh has retaliated against former Pakistan cricketer Shahid Afridi over Kashmir
 rajnath singh ne kaha- afridi thik bol rahe hai
 They are not able to handle Pakistan, what will Kashmir handle? Kashmir is an integral part of India
 pakistan ke purv cricketer shahid afridi ne kashmir mudde landan main kaha tha ki pakistan ko kashmir nahin chahie
 Four states of Pakistan were not able to handle themselves
 afridi ne yah bayaan landan main british sansad main chaatro ko sambodhit karte hue diya
 In a video posted on social media, Afridi can be heard saying, 'I say Pakistan does not want Kashmir
 or ise bharat ko bhi mat do
 Let Kashmir be an independent country
 kam se kam insaaniyat to jinda rahegi
 People will not die
 pakistan ko kashmir nahin chahie
 Pakistan cannot manage four states of its own
 sabase badi cheez insaaniyat he
 People are dying there, it hurts a lot
 marane vaala kisi bhi samudaay se taalluk rakhe, lekin yah dukhadaayi he
 On this statement of Afridi, on Thursday, Rajnath Singh said that he said the right thing
 wo pakistan sambhaal nahin paa rahe, kashmir kya sambhaal paaenge? kashmir bharat kaa part tha or rahegaa
 Significantly, in April, Shahid Afridi wrote on Twitter that the current situation in Kashmir is worrying and terrible
 unhone kaha ki damankaaree shaasha drudh sankalp or swatantraaa kii aawaaj ko dabaane ke liye bekasooron ko goli maar rahe hai
 Wondering where the UN and other international institutions are and why they don't try to stop this bloody game
 iske baad afridi kaa kaaphi virodh hua tha

 Due to the riots, Home Minister Teresa has left the summer vacation and returned
 unhone chetavanee di he ki doshiyon ke khilaaf sakht karrwai kii jaaegi
 The riot erupted on Saturday night after the 29-year-old youth in Tottenham died in police firing
 lebar party ke varisht netaa or landan ke purv meyar ken livingstone kaa maananaa he ki david camran sarkaar dwaara saarvajanik kharch main gahari katautiyaan dange or lutpaat kii ek vajah he jo totenham main shuru hue or rajdhani ke anya ilaakon main fail gaye
 He said that the austerity drive of the coalition government created a 'social divide', forcing the police to clash with communities
 unke najariye jaisaa hi bayaan metropolitan police praadhikaran kii ek sadsy jeni johns ne diya
 He described the rioting as an impact on the self-confidence of police officers

 Apart from the thrust of the Lok Sabha elections, there is a continuous upheaval in the politics of Goa
 manohar parrikar ke nidhan ke baad pichley hafte pramod saavant kii aguwai main bijepi kii nai sarkaar ke shapath grahan ke mahaj ek hafte main hi upmukhyamantri sudin dhavalikar ko pad se hataa diya gaya he
 Last night, two mlas of the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP), the bjp's partner party, joined the BJP, leaving only one MGP party MLA in the House
 isse pehle mangalvaar or buudhvaar kii raat (1:45 baje) maharashtravaadi gomantak party (emjeepi) kii sadan main party kii vidhaayi ikai kaa bijepi main vilay ho gaya
 MGP has 3 mlas in Goa Legislative Assembly and out of these 2 mlas Manohar Ajgaonkar and Deepak Pavaskar joined BJP
 goa main nai sarkaar ke astitv main aane ke ek hafte ke andar raajnneetik halchal achaanak bad gai
 After the new developments, CM Pramod Sawant said that both of them will be sworn in in front of the Governor at 12 noon on Wednesday
 manohar ajaganvkar or deepak pavaskar ne raat 1:45 baje vidhansabha adhyaksh maaikel lobo ko vilay patr saunpa, lekin is patr main emjeepi ke tisare vidhayak sudin dhavalikar ke hastakshar nahin tha
 However Dhawalikar was the deputy CM in the bjp-led coalition government
 siem pramod saavant ne goa vidhansabha ke adhyaksh ko patr likhakar is bare main jaankaree di
 He said that the MGP has 3 mlas in the Assembly, but now two-thirds of the mlas have joined the BJP
 ab 36 sadasyon vaali goa vidhansabha main ab bijepi ke 14 sadsy ho gaye hai
 Explain that under the anti-defection law, if at least two-thirds of the mlas leave the party together, only then they can be recognized as a separate party and their assembly membership also remains
 pavaskar kaa daawa- milegaa sarkaar main mantri padbijapi main shaamil hue vidhayak pavaskar kaa daawa he ki ab unhen goa sarkaar main mantri kaa pad milegaa
 At the same time, such speculations are also being made that Dhawalikar may be shown a way out of the cabinet on Wednesday
 bataa den ki manohar parrikar ke nidhan ke baad bijepi ko goa main apni sarkaar bachaane ke liye kaaphi mashkkat kerani padi thim
 MGP leader Dhawalikar also wanted to become CM
 MGP MLA Deepak Pauskar after merger of Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Legislative Party with BJP: Sudin Dhavalikar (goa Deputy CM & MGP MLA) should be dropped now
 He will be dropped during working hours today
 # Goahttps: / / t
 co / wbjjprdudd— ANI (@ANI) March 26, 2019 Ajgaonkar said - Where the PM goes, the same name goes to Goa Tourism Minister and MGP MLA Manohar Ajgaonkar said that the next government will be formed by BJP
 kyonki piem modi jahaan bhi jate hai, log unheen kaa naam lete hai
 As a Dalit leader i felt insecure at MGP
 congress netaa kaavthankar ne kaha ki bhaajapa main shaamil hona apana astitv khatm karnaa hecongress netaa sunil kaavthankar ne kaha ki bijepi main shaamil hona kisi bhi dal ke liye apana astitv khatm karnaa he
 This is a major political threat
 isse bhavishya main chote dalon kaa koi vajood hi nahin rahegaa
 After taking majority vote, Chief Minister Pramod Sawant proved majority in Goa Assembly on 20 March
 bijepi sarkaar ke paksh main kul 20 vot pade, yani abhi ke liye bijepi sarkaar se sankat tal gaya he
 The majority needed 19 mlas, but the BJP had one more
 maujuuda aankadon ko dekhen to bijepi ke paas abhi 12 vidhayak, goa forward party ke 3 vidhayak, emjeepi ke 3 or teen nirdaleey vidhayak hai yani bijepi ke paas kul 21 vidhayak hai
 Which is 2 more than the majority
 jabaki congress ke paas 14 vidhayak hai or ek ensipi kaa vidhayak he
 Questions were beginning to arise after Parrikar: After the death of Manohar Parrikar, BJP colleagues in Goa questioned the leadership, because there were many parties who came to support the government in the name of Parrikar
 lekin lagaataar chali baithkon ke baad pramod saavant ke naam par muhar lagi or sahyogi bhi maane
 Goa has a total of 40 assemblies, but currently 4 seats in the state are vacant
 jinpar upachunaav honge
 So now the majority was decided according to the 36 assembly seats in Goa, so only 19 was needed to prove the majority

 The popularity of smart devices is increasing all over the world
 chaahe smartphone ho yaa smart spikar yaa smart watch
 But the threat to privacy is also increasing with these devices
 is bich ek khabar Amazon ke smart spikar Echo ko lekar saamne ai he
 According to the information, this Amazon smart speaker recorded the personal information of a couple and sent it to one of their contacts
 siatel sthit ek televijan stesan 'kiro' kii report ke mutabik, ye ghatana portland kii he jahaan amejan ke smart spikar ke alexa ne danniel or unke pati kii nijee baatcheet ko record kiya or unke hi ek parichit ko bhej diya
 The couple was not even aware of this, but they got this information when their staff told them that an audio file of their conversation had been found
 ghatana kii jaankaree milte hi danniel ne isaki shikaayat amejan se kii
 The company then sent the engineer to investigate
 jaanch ke dauraan ejeeniyar ne kapal kii baat ko sahi tehraaya or maafee maangi
 After this, the company gave clarification on this whole issue and explained why Alexa did this
 company ne kaha kichaledne sochaa ki kapal ne order diya he or wo actevet ho gaya
 Also, during Couple's conversation, Alexa accidentally heard 'send message'
 becoground main chal rahi baatcheet ke aadhaar par usne contact list se naam chunaa or phir file use bhej diya
 Amazon later admitted that they had made a mistake and said that the company was working on it so that such a mistake would not be repeated in future
 november kaa aakhri din
 At half past one in the afternoon, a waiter in the quality restaurant of the famous New Market of Bhopal is habitually removing the problems of tablecloth
 andar rasoie kisi bhi order par khaanaa taiyaar karne ke liye tatpar hai
 Televisions are running to entertain people
 lekin unhen dekhne vaali ankhen vahaan nahin hai
 Demonetisation has such an impact that this restaurant, which is busy on normal days, does not have any customers at this time
 aisa nahin he ki yahaan digital tareekon se paisa na chukaaya ja saktaa ho, phir bhi kuch baat he ki logon ke kadam tham se gaye hai
 Is Bhopal and Delhi, from the shop of groceries to the showrooms of cars, the thick sheet of recession is being spread? 500 on November 9 and Rs 1,000
 ke noton ke chalan se baahar hone ke baad se desh ke j yaadaatar shaharon ke bazaaron kii tabiyat nasaaj he
 Praveen Khandelwal, general secretary of the Confederation of All India Traders' Associations (CAIT), the largest trader's association in the country, describes the situation as follows: "understand that markets have fallen by 70 to 75 per cent on average
" lambey samay main notebandi ke achche parinaam aaenge, lekin philhal do-teen maheene bazaaron ko isi daur se guzarana hoga
 "being a worldly businessman, Khandelwal is making a very cautious statement and is hoping that even small traders will cut these three months somehow
 ve is andeshe par zyada vimarsh karne ko taiyaar nahin hai ki yadi yahi daur chah maheene khinch gaya to vyapaariyon kaa kya haal hoga?lekin desh ke alag-alag bazaaron se uth rahe sanket bataa rahe hai ki vyapaaree netaa yaa kaarobaar visheshgy agyaat vajahon se notebandi ke said effect bataane main atirikt saavdhaanee barat rahe hai
 By the way, demonetisation has had a dramatic effect on the markets
 jaise notebandi ke teen din ke bheetar desh main ek lakh iphone bik gaye
 Most shopkeepers showed their billing on or before 8 November
 puraane noton ko khapaane ke liye jis tarah log iphone par tut pade, usase isaki bikri kai guna bad gai
 Similarly, on the night of 8 November, gold in old notes was Rs 50,000
 prati 10 gram tak bika
 But then? What happened after that was the beginning of a nightmare for shopkeepers
 jaise iphone to chhodie, desh kaa puraa mobile phone market baith gaya
 Mobile industry sources estimate that before demonetisation where daily Rs 350 to 400 crore
 ke handset desh main bikate the, vahiin iske aadhe bechnaa bhi mushkil ho gaya he
 Many large mobile companies are in a position to lay off their employees
 mek in india abhiyaan kii shuruyaat ke baad se pichley 18 maheene main 40 choti-badi companiyaan desh main hi mobile handset utpaadan kii taiyaari kar rahi thim, lekin ab unhone apane kadam philhal roak liye hai
 This is going to affect jobs in a big way
 udhar, notebandi kii raat balliyon uchhalane vaala sona dhadaam ho gaya
 The next day, the major bullion markets of Delhi remained closed due to the raids of excise lying all over the country and the fear of raids thereafter
 karol baag jaise mashhoor bazaar jab khule to ve graahakon ko dekhne ko taras gaye
 The condition of bullion market is that there are fewer customers coming there
 sarraf is pasopesh main hai ki agar sona bechein bhi to uskaa i-tranjaction kaise ho? do lakh ru
 PANCARD has become mandatory on transactions above Rs
 jinke paas vaid paisa he, ve log bhi soch rahe hai ki kahin bada lenden karne se khwamakhwaah ve iskar ke pachade main na funs jaaen
 If notice is received then you will have to answer
 sarkaar, vyapaaree or kharidaar ke bich panape is avishvaas kaa nateeja yah he ki shaadiyon kaa mausam hone ke baavjood sone kii maang main 80 fisadi kii kami darj kii gai he
 It is not that this effect of demonetisation has had on expensive things like gold and iphone
 iskaa sidhaa asar hamaare aas-pados kii parchun kii dukaan or sabji waalon tak gaya he
 The price of flour in delhi-ncr since demonetisation is Rs
 6
 kilo tak bad chuki he
 This effect can be clearly read on the face of Sunil Kumar, who runs a grocery shop in Vasundhara Sector-4 of Ghaziabad
 sunil pichley 20 din se badi sankchaya main apane niyamit graahakon ko saamaan udhaar bech rahe hai
 Their dilemma is that if the customers do not lend the goods, the tied customers will be missed
 dukandaaree baith jaaegi so alag
 She has called for a new swipe machine after demonetisation, but she has not been able to meet them yet
 swip mashin kii uplabdhta kii is samasya se un jaise kai dukandaar jujh rahe hai
 Seeing the root cause of this problem, Khandelwal says, "there are 1
4 million swipe machines in the country at present, while about 20 million machines are needed for digital transactions
 " is tarah dekha jaae to pradhanmantri narendra modi ne kul jarurat kii mahaj 7 fisadi swip mashiinon ke saath hi desh main cashles lenden kaa naaraa oochaal diya
 It is also amazing that swipe machines are not made in the country and for these we are badly dependent on imports
 yani sunil jaise dukandaaron ko agle paanch-chah maheene phoonk-phoonk kar kadam rakhana he
 You can feel the impact of groceries on different shops
 lekin isaki badi tasviir kaa andaja upabhokta vastuon kii pramukh company hindustan liver kii taaja gatividhiyon se chalata he
 If sources are to be believed, the company has budgeted Rs 300 crore for its advertisements to be shown on TV
 kii taatkaalik kami kar di he
 This decrease in the advertising budget is telling how the company sees a decrease in the demand for consumer goods
 bazaar or udyog main aae is bhuuchaal ke baad reating agency fich ne chaalu vitt varsh main bharat kii aarthik vikaas dar ke anumaan ko 7
 4 per cent to 6
 9 fisadi kar diya he
 Estimates of economic growth have also been reduced for the next fiscal year
 yani jis notebandi ko aam aadmi kaale dhan kii vasuuli ke hawaii khwab or bank kii kataron main ho rahi pareshaani ke taur par dekh rahaa he, uskaa dayera itani dur tak jaataa he, jahaan tak sochane kii jarurat aam aadmi kii jagah chune hue arthshaastriyon ko hi hoti he
 The reason for the infectious effect of demonetisation is that most of the market operations in the country run in cash
 is samay logon kii jarurat kaa mahaj 14 fisadi cash hi uplabdh he
 The problem with this cache is that the people who get the first batch of new notes (in many cases Rs 2,000) after putting them in line for several days
 kaa ek hi note) hasil kar rahe hai, ve use kharch nahin karnaa chaahate
 Their simple mentality is that when the note is so difficult to get, then keep this note for a thick time
 aam aadmi kii yah soch samajhadaari bhari to he, lekin arthtantr ke liye ghaatak he
 As a result of this, which is Rs 2 lakh crore
 ke nae note arabiai ne jari bhi kar die hai, unka bhi ek chota sa hissaa hi bazaar ke lenden main kaam aa rahaa he
 That is, by the end of the month of November, the money reached the hands of the people, in fact it is not reaching the market
 isiilie bazaaron kii nabj sust chal rahi he or bhopal ke quality restaurant jaise upkram inhen vajahon se graahakon ko taras rahe hai
 This decline of the market will only increase when people pay their bank account in the first week of December, but will not reach their hands
 in halaat main madhyam varg ke haath se hokar kaamgaar or bazaar tak pahunchane vaali nakadi kaa chakra tuutegaa
 It will take several months for the government to handle this cycle, but during this time the productive days of the market will not be returned

 pyaaj ke liye nunatam niryaat mulya ke khatm hone se kaarobaari khush hai, kisaan ke chehre par bhi muskuraahat lauti he, lekin keemten tay karne ko lekar wo abhi bhi sarkaar kii taraf takataki lagaaye baitha he
 Onion, which reached near 100 rupees a few days ago, is being sold today at Rs 10-12 per kg in the wholesale market
 pyaaj kii sabase badi mandi maharashtra ke nasik ke kareeb lasalgamv main hai, jahaan kisaanon kii shikaayat thi upaj se milane vaali keemat se kharch nikaalnaa bhi mushkil he
 But now the government has completely cut the export price of onion in view of the rapidly decreasing prices

 In the second week of December, the export price of onion was reduced from 700 to $ 400 per quintal, but still the export did not increase, now it has been completely finished
 tippaniyan Ramrao Pardeshi, an onion businessman in Lasalgaon, believes this will increase exports and benefit farmers
 pyaaj kii fasal ko pehle barish ne barbaad kiya, phir keemten teji se chadhin or bikri kam ho gai
 The onion did not make people cry, so the government imported it, as a result, the farmers suffered heavy losses, as the arrival of the mandi in the coming days could put further pressure on prices, hence the farmers were demanding to reduce the MEP

 During the Punjab elections, between Delhi and Jalandhar, a house in the village of Gohawar will be built by Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal, which means that he will stay here permanently
 gaanv main punjab ke ludhiana or jalandhar ke bichon bich gohavar naam ke gaanv main ek ghar kejariwal kaa thikaana hoga
 The comments saat kamaron kaa yah makaan aam aadmi party ke enarai cell ke state kanvener jagataar singh sanghera kaa he
 This two-storey house will be used as a ground party office where party leaders and workers will meet and discuss election strategies
 makaan ke pehle maale main kejariwal khud rahenge
 It is believed that initially, Kejriwal will spend 10-15 days in the month of Punjab, but will give full time in Punjab only after the election is announced
 rahane ke liye arvind kejariwal ne jis jagah ko chunaa he vah ranneetik drushti se bhi mahatvapurn he kyonki yah sthaan punjab ke lagbhag bich main sthit he yani yahaan se punjab kii zyaadaatar jagahen lagbhag samaan duuri par hai
 However, the house is yet to be repaired
 darasal, party netaaon or kaaryakartaaon kii taraf se lagaataar shikaayat aa rahi thi ki party ke bade netaa dilli main baithkar punjab ke liye faisla kar rahe hai
 Therefore, Kejriwal decided that he himself would stay in Punjab and would sit with the party leaders and take decisions
 is sambandh main guuruuvaar ko unhone elaan bhi kiya tha ki 'ab main panjab main khunta gaadkar baithunga'
 This seven-room house belongs to Jagatar Singh Sanghera, the state convener of the NRI cell of the Aam Aadmi Party
 is do manjila makaan kaa bhootal party offis ke rup main istemaal kiya jayega jahaan party ke netaa or kaaryakarta baithak kar chunavi ranneetiyon par charchaa karenge
 Kejriwal himself will live in the first floor of the house
 mana ja rahaa he ki shuruyaat main kejariwal maheene ke 10-15 din punjab main rahaa karenge, lekin chunaav kii ghoshnaa hone ke baad punjab main hi puraa samay denge
 The place Arvind Kejriwal has chosen to stay is also important from a strategic point of view as this place is located almost in the middle of Punjab i
e
 from here most of the places of Punjab are almost equal distance
 haalanki abhi is ghar main marammat kaa kaam hona baaki he
 In fact, there were constant complaints from party leaders and activists that senior leaders of the party are sitting in Delhi and deciding for Punjab
 isliye kejariwal ne tay kiya ki vah khud punjab main rahenge or party netaaon ko saath baitaakar faisle karenge
 In this regard, on Thursday, he also announced that "now i will sit with a peg in Punjab"
 darasal, party netaaon or kaaryakartaaon kii taraf se lagaataar shikaayat aa rahi thi ki party ke bade netaa dilli main baithkar punjab ke liye faisla kar rahe hai
 Therefore, Kejriwal decided that he himself would stay in Punjab and would sit with the party leaders and take decisions
 is sambandh main guuruuvaar ko unhone elaan bhi kiya tha ki 'ab main panjab main khunta gaadkar baithunga'

 In Rakhigarhi, the impression of the city of ancient civilization appeared throughout the village
 thik vaise hi jaise sindhu sabhyataa ke anya sthanon- hadappa or mohenjodaro main dikhaai detii rahi hogi
 Remnants of the developed civilization, by digging the ground in Rakhigarhi, establishes that the developed civilization existed even 4,500 years ago
 vahaan se jo puraavashesh mili hai ve vaidic krishi sabhyataa se bahut alag hai
 In 2015, a team led by Vasant Shinde, a professor at Deccan College of Archeology, Pune, started excavating the mounds of Rakhigarhi
 rakhigadhi gaanv or aasapaas 900 acre ke kshetra main faile aise saat tile hai
 About 4,500 years old skeletons were found about one kilometer from the township
 inke diene semple kaa lakhanu ke birbal saahani institute of peleobotni ke anuvanshiki vigyaani niraj raay ne adhyayan kiya
 The geneticist confirmed that the R1a gene (also known as Aryan genus) was not found from the skeleton found in Rakhigarhi, but Professor Shinde did not attach much importance to the discovery
 rakhigadhi ke diene or dakshin bhartiya adivasee aabaadi se kareebi se match kiya gaya to sanket mila ki sindhu ghati kii sabhyataa ke dauraan shuruaati dravid bhashaa boli jaati thi
 The bjp's Jhatkarakhigarhi findings have shocked the efforts of the BJP under which it wants to rewrite the ancient history of India
 vahiin nafe singh jaise gramin in nishkarshon ko jivan ke anubhav se kam nahin maanate
 Nafe Singh was among the workers whose skeletons were found while digging the ground
 nafe singh ne kaha, 'maine un kankalon ko dekha, wo hamaare jaise nahin the
 He was very tall
 purush kankal kaa ghutana hi itnaa ooncha tha ki meri qamar tak pahunch jaae
 His skull was twice the size of ours
 maine jivan main itane lambey log kabhi nahin dekhe
 Local villager Wazir Chand is not surprised about the controversy
 rakhigadhi main pehle jitani baar bhi jameen khodne kaa kaam hua, vajeer chand uske gavaah rahe
 According to Wazir Chand, he looked at the excavated beads as well as the remains of furnaces, brick-bound drainage systems and well-planned routes
 vajeer chand bachapan se hi puraavashesh ikattha kar rahe hai
 Wazir Chand has donated his valuable collection of antiquities to the Archaeological Museum to be built in Rakhigarhi
 vajeer chand kehete hai, 'sakshya yaa saboot har kisi ke dekhne ke liye hai
 There is no doubt that beneath these mounds are the remains of a developed city
 nishkarsh nikaalnaa jaankaar logon kaa kaam he
 i am fully convinced that this place must have been very important at some point

 Although the places where the excavation was done have now been filled, but the India Today team was successful in reaching the mound where the recent heavy rains again made pits
 yahaan tile ke aasapaas kachi or pakki inten dekhi ja sakati hai
 a well-planned township, former sarpanch Dinesh Singh told India Today, "we were told that these are the symbols of the developed Indus Valley civilization when mud bricks made of clay were used to build houses and water drainage
 Paved bricks were used on the way

 All this shows that there was a very well planned city here

 Whatever antiquities came out from there have been stored in the Haryana Government Regional Museum in Hisar

 Rakhigarhi may have once been a capital or a major center of power

 Sheesh Pal, assistant superintendent of the regional museum, Hisar, told India Today, 'the tiger is associated with power
 yahaan mili baagh kii chhap se saaf he ki rakhigadhi kabhi bade mahatv kaa sthaan rahaa hoga
 Three stages of the Harappan civilization were found in Rakhigarhi

 He said that if the civilization developed a little, clay bricks started being used
