 Amendment of constitution
 
 
 sanshodhan ke prastaav kii shuruyaat sansad main hoti he jahaan ise ek bill ke rup main pesh kiya jaataa he
 It must then be approved by each House of Parliament
 prayek sadan main (1) ise upasthit saansadon kaa do tihaai bahumat or matdaan praapt hona chahie or (2) sabhi sadasyon (upasthit yaa anupasthit) kaa saadhaaran bahumat praapt hona chahie
 Thereafter, specific amendments should also be approved by at least half of the state legislatures
 ek baar jab sabhi anya avasthaaen puri kar lee jaati hai, sanshodhan ke liye bharat ke raashtrapati kii sweekruti praapt kii jaati he, parantu yah antim pravastha keval ek aupchaarikta hi he
 The term socialist was added to the Preamble by the 42nd Amendment Act of 1976 of the Constitution
 maharashtra sarkaar ne nae motor whical act par likhi nitin gadakari ko chittheene act main sanshodhan karne kii uthi maang kaha- janata ke liye jurmaana bharna mushkingle kuch hi maheenon main kai rajyon main vidhansabha chunavaa hone vaale hai
 In such a situation, these electoral states are now afraid of the new Motor Vehicle Act
 yahi vajah he ki jin rajyon main chunaav he, vahaan is act main chhot dene kii maang uth rahi he
 Before the elections in Maharashtra, the government has written a letter to Union Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari
 maharashtra ke parivahan mantri divakar ravate ne kaha he ki patr main nae yatayaat niyamon main baari jurmaana lagaae jane par punarvichaar karne ke liye kaha he
 The Maharashtra government has asked the Center to reduce the fine
 pradesh sarkaar ne patr main kaha he ki log itnaa jurmaana nahin bhar sakate
 We will not wait until we get an answer and apply the new penalty
 sarkaar kii ore se likhi gai chitthee main is baat kaa zikr kiya gaya he ki baari-bharkam jurmaana rajya ke logon ke liye mushkilen badhaane vaala he
 The letter appealed to the Central Government to make necessary changes in the Motor Vehicle Act
 maharashtra sarkaar kii maang he ki trephic niyamon ke ulanghan par lagaaya ja rahaa jurmaana janata kii kshamta se kahin zyada he
 People cannot pay much fine
 hamane sarkaar se apil kii he, sarkaar chaalaan kii raashi main katautee kare
 If we get an answer, we will look into further action
 parivahan mantri kii chitthee main zikr likhaa gaya he, 'vistrut charchaa ke baad ham is nishkarsh par pahunche hai ki aam janata ke liye bahut zyada jurmaana he
 If someone has already paid more fine, he may be entitled to get some amount back from the court
 jurmaane kii raashi kam karne par vichaar kiya janaa chahie
 'diwakar Rawate wrote new traffic rules are being discussed at different places
 ek cheez saaf he ki puraane niyamon ke mutabik jurmaane kii raashi kam thi, isliye log trephic niyamon ko todate the
 But the new traffic fines are putting too much on people
 log is faisle se khush nahin he
 The amount of the fine is more
 haalanki is chitthee par kendriya mantri nitin gadakari kii koi pratikriya saamne nahin ai he
 It remains to be seen whether the central government reconsiders its decision in the coming days
 sharat chandra chattopadhyaay kaa naam suna he? shaayad thodi mushkil ho pahchaanane main, 'devdas' likhi thi inhone jis par 16 filmein ban chuki hai (shahrukh vaali bhi)
 If you are told, you may be able to identify with a temper
 vaise yah kahkar bengal ke kala premi samaaj ke saath jyaadati nahin kii ja sakati ki wo sharat babu ko bhul gaya hoga
 Today, you may have to staple films to identify Sharat Babu, but Sharat Babu was writing at a time when the writer used to be a pioneer of society and films
 15 sitambar 1876 ko vah british bharat main paidaa hue the
 Sharat, who wrote dozens of books, could not even complete his studies
 lekhan kaa ye wo kaal tha jab hindi apana aakaar lene kii koshish kar rahi thi or angreji samajhane vaale ungaliyon par the
 Every word that Sharat wrote in his madari language shone like a pearl
 sharat premika ke julfon main sitaarein nahin jad rahe the, samaaj kii sadaandh ke khilaaf kalam ke khomache lekar khadey thea
 Where his life was less complicated than the characters in his novel
 gale kii mas bhi nahin phooti thi ki anaath ho gaye
 Could not read further if i had money
 desh main naukari nahin mili to chale gaye burma
 When he got bored of life's problems, he became a monk
 isi daur main pehali kahani chhapi 'mandir'
 When the writing and printing started, the people of Bengal placed their yugaapura on their foreheads
 sharathchandra ab sharat babu ban gaye
 The most precious years of his life were spent in Samatabari in Bengal
 is ghar main jahaan sharat baith kar likhte the vahaan se hokar rupanarayan nadi baha karti thi
 This river must have been witness to seeing the word take the form of Narayana
 isamen koi hairat bhi nahin honi chahie ki jab sharat duniyaan kaa adhyay nipta kar gaye to is nadi ne bhi apni disha badal lee
 Sharat never wrote for the market, but the market was always buzzing with his writing
 kai upanyaason par filmein bani wo bhi kai jabaanon main
 'parinita', 'devdas', 'swami', 'choti Bahu' and this list keeps increasing
 sharat ke gaanv main aaj bhi unke chaahane vaale badastoor har saal sharat mela kaa aayojan karte hai bagaiyr kisi sarkari madad ke
 People of Bengal have always loved artists, writers
 shaayad yahi kaaran he ki kudarat ne bhi bengal kii dharti par ek se badhkar ek nagine jade
 However, Sharat Chandra's death anniversary passed
 unki koi kitaab kharidkar padhiega
 There is no better way to remember a writer

 Reddy, who left the Congress on February 19 last, ended speculation for several days that the new party's policies and programs would be announced on March 12 at a public meeting at Rajahmundry in coastal Andhra
 samprag sarkaar ke khilaaf avishvaas prastaav laane ke liye congress se pehle hi nikaale ja chuke kuch saansadon ke saath reddy ne kaha, 'ham milakar telugu logon kii pratishtha or sammaan ko barkaraar rakhane ke liye nai party kii shuruuaat kar rahe hai jo rajya ke vibhaajan ke tareeke se buree tarah aahat hua he
 ' unhone kaha, 'unhone niyamon or prakriyaaon kaa ulanghan kiya
 Insulted the Telugu people

 Reddy alleged that TDP chief n Chandrababu Naidu, who was the chief minister for nine years and the Leader of Opposition in the state assembly for 10 years, could not express his views to keep the state undivided and this is shameful
 unhone jagan mohan reddy nit wiesar congress par aarope lagaaya ki yah party darasal andhra pradesh kaa vibhaajan chaah rahi he lekin ve dikhaava kar rahe the ki ve avibhajit rajya ke paksh main hai
 Since resigning from the post of Chief Minister, Reddy has been thinking about building a new organization with his supporters
 inamen congress ke nishkasit saansad, kuch mantri or vidhayak tathaa karmchaaree sanghathanon ke netaa bhi shaamil hai
 He had also allegedly conducted surveys to gauge the mood of the new party
 reddy ne kaha, 'nai party telugu janata kii nabj ko pakadegi
 The former Congress leader targeted both the Congress and the BJP, accusing them of not respecting the sentiments of the Telugu-speaking people in the context of the bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh
 unhone kaha ki laalkrishna adwani kehete hai ki unhone aisa trutipurna vidheyak nahin dekha
 Sushma Swaraj said that the bill was not introduced in the Lok Sabha
 hamaari party ke pradhanmantri kehete hai ki saansadon ke abhadra vyavhaar se unhen dukh hua
 But not a single party spoke to the Telugu people
 reddy ne rajya ke kuch mantriyon or kuch vipakshi dalon ke bhrashtachar ke aaropon ko bhi khaarij kar diya
 Citing the example of unification of Germany, the former Chief Minister indicated that Andhra Pradesh may still be one

 pati kii hatya ke baad nandini or peetaambar ke bich phone par hue premalap ke jariye police ne raju sahu kii maut ke raaj se pardaa uthaaya
 Actually, on December 5, the body of an unknown person was found in the bushes of Mahananda in a state of infertility
 mritak kaa sir kuchal diya gaya tha or petrol se jalaane kii koshish bhi kii gai thi
 Police said that Nandini had acted very cunningly and on December 4, the next day after killing her, she had also lodged a complaint about her husband's disappearance for two days at the Torwa police station
 nandini ne agyaat shaks kii laash kii pahchaan apane pati raju sahu ke rup main kar lee
 The deceased was identified through sweaters and shoes
 itnaa hi nahin, nandini ne police se apane pati ke hatyaron ko sajaa dene kii guhaar bhi lagaai
 But only a week after her husband's death, Nandini's real face began to appear
 vah apane premi peetaambar ke saath prem kii pingen ladaane lagi
 Both courts were hiding secretly, but the news of this also reached the family

 There they crushed his head with a stone to hide the identity of the deceased
 itnaa hi nahin, unhone petrol chhidakar shav ko jalaane kii bhi koshish kii, lekin thand kii vajah se laash puri tarah nahin jal pai
 Therefore, the dead part of the dead body and sweater and shoes could identify the deceased

 When police were questioned by both, there was a contradiction in their statements

 Who would have known better than Prime Minister Narendra Modi who is the leader of India's foreign trade from Gujarat, where the balanced exchange rate is necessary for export but in the last four years, the rupee has become thicker and exports have become leaner
 rupee kii kamajori par rudaali kii parampara ai kahaan se?is maamle main dakshin, vam or madhya, sab ek jaisi hi granthi ke shikaar hai
 The history of then Prime Minister Narasimha Rao's "agony", while devaluing the rupee in 1991, is recorded in history

 Therefore, the surprise should not be on the falling of the rupee but on the "indigenes" who have been carrying the corpse of British colonial economic policy for decades

 Sonali, who recently returned after spending several months in New York for metastatic cancer treatment, shared her way of coping with the disease
 unhone kaha, "keval 'si' shabd kaa ullekh sunne lene vaale kisi bhi shaks ke dil main khauf aa jaataa he
 We are very afraid that we do not even talk about it
 
 That is why it has become so important one day, where we understand about it and help in dealing with this disease

 World Cancer Day


 who would have thought it would become such a thing


 but it has! And just the mere mention of the c word brings dread in the hearts of anyone who hears it
 We fear it so much that we'd rather not talk about it


 which is why it's important to have a day where we pull out the band aid and help us deal with this disease
 i was scared too, but soon realised that burying my head in the sand was not the way to deal with this
 And so


 with the little experience i have had, i urge you all to take the time to understand it
 There's more to cancer than being emotional or weak or even being called a fighter or a survivor
 It requires you to study it, find out what works for you and to be diligent about your treatment
 It requires days of strongly believing in oneself, of knowing that tomorrow will be better than today
 It is not a fight against negative thoughts
 It's taking a stand to not give in, no matter what
 Most importantly, it is about living every day, and not just surviving
 Just taking it # onedayatatime makes it easier to # switchonthesunshine

 By the way, in the programs of the Sangh, former Vice President of India, Dr

 The Sangh wants that people of opposing ideology also come to the programs of the Sangh or if people of the opposing ideology call the leaders of the Sangh in their programs, then there will be exchange of ideas, then you can understand each other's ideology very well

 Some people come, some don't
 sangh kaa maananaa he ki virdohi vichaardhaara ke log sangh ko sunne ke baad bhi usase sahamat nahin hote hai or naseehat de dekar jate hai
 Now everyone's eyes are that today, Pranab Mukherjee praises the thoughts and actions of the Sangh in his speech, or will go to them for a change in ideology, because his daughter Shirmishthane has tweeted and told the Sangh and BJP to be a rumor
 ab dekhnaa he ki pranab mukherjee sangh ke liye kya kehete hai
 He is said to be a magician of words
 karmchaariyon or vipaksh ke virodh kii vajah se centre sarkaar jab do baar karmchaaree bhavishya nidhi ke dhaanche main buniyadi badlaav nahin kar pai, to usne teesri koshish main ipief kii byaaj dar gata di haalanki is maamle par bhi sarkaar ko peeche hatana padaa
 Read the full report, why the government is eyeing your PF
 
 
 sarkaar ke haalia faislon ko lekar karmchaaree bhavishya nidhi (ipief) par bhram kii sthiti yah thi ki 19 april ko is mudde par bangaluru main pradarshan kar rahi ek mahila ne police kamisionar se kaha, ''sahab, meraa pief bachaa lijie
 "there was tremendous violence in this demonstration
 darasal, desh main logon kii badhati ausat aayu ke maddenjar sarkaar chaahati he ki sevanivritti ke baad log pai-pai ko mohataaj na hon
 Though there is a provision of EPF for this, but it wants people to choose the National Pension Scheme (NPS) instead, so that they continue to get lifetime working pension instead of lump sum
 lekin pief ke mukaable enpies kam lubhaavni he
 In such a situation, it seems from the government's plans that its focus is on people's hard earned money
 sarkaar ne donon yojanaon ko samaan banane ke iraade se farvari ke aakhir main kendriya bajet main ipief kii nikasi par 60 fisadi rakam ko tex yogya bana diya
 It was later clarified that this tax will not be levied on the interest, but on the principal
 tab tak karmchaariyon ke bich yah baat fail gai ki sarkaar kii manshaa thik nahin he
 Later, the government overturned this decision
 sarkaar ne farvari main hi ek or vyavastha kii ki pief main niyokta ke 12 fisadi yogadan (3
 67 percent EPF and 8
 33 fisadi karmchaaree pension skim-ipies) kii rakam ko 58 saal kii umr main hi nikaala ja sakegaa
 Earlier this amount could be withdrawn anytime or in case of unemployment for 60 days
 ise 1 may se lagu kiya janaa tha, lekin bangaluru hinsa ke baad kendriya shram mantri bandaaru dattatreya ne pief nikaalane ke niyamon ko pehle 31 july tak or phir sire se taal diya
 Actually, Employees Provident Fund Organization (EPFO) has around 15
 84 karod khate hai, jinamein 3
 There are 7 crore active accounts
 inamen kareeb teen karod logon kaa vetan 15,000 ru
 And the government considers around 70 lakh people in the category of 'medium or more' salary
 yah unki forced seaving hoti he, jo gadhe vakt main kaam aati he or unhen har saal apni jamaa puunji par sarkaar kii ore se byaaj kii ghoshnaa kaa intjaar rahata he
 The Finance Audit and Advisory Committee of EPFO had said that in view of income, this time 8
 95 fisadi byaaj diya ja saktaa he or iske baavjood uske khate main 91 karod ru
 Surplus will be
 desh ke vibhinn majdoor sanghathanon ne 8
 90 percent interest rate was demanded
 us par sahmati nahin ban saki or dattatreya ne 16 farvari ko ipiefo ke kendriya trustee board (sibiti) kii 211veen baithak ke baad elaan kiya, ''pief par byaaj kii maujuuda dar 8
 75 percent to 8 for 2015-16
 8 fisadi (antarim) kar diya gaya he
 We did 8 last time
 75 fisadi byaaj diya tha
 However, even after this, 673 in epfo's account
 85 karod ru
 Will be saved chunki paise se jude maamle main vitt mantralay kii salaah leni hoti he
 In response to the letter sent by the EPFO in this regard, the Finance Ministry said that the interest rate on PF should also be reduced in view of the market situation and the declining interest rates on various schemes
 is babat dattatreya ne 25 april ko loksabhaa ko bataaya, ''vitt mantralay ne 8
 The rate of 7 per cent has been approved
 ''sarkaar ke is faisle par majdoor sanghathanon ne asantosh jaahir kar virodh kaa elaan kar diya
 rss-linked Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS) general secretary Virjesh Upadhyay said, "BMS opposes this cut
 '' unhone deshbhar main ipief daftaron ke saamne virodh pradarshan kiya
 The cpi-backed All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC) termed it as an unbecoming intervention of the Finance Ministry, saying, "when EPFO 8
 9 fisadi aay ko sahi tehra rahaa ho or board ne 8
 If the 8 per cent is approved, it is a gross interference from the Finance Ministry
 '' ol india railway mens federation ke mahasachiv commered shivagopal mishra sarkaar par majdoor virdohi hone kaa aarope lagaate hue kehete hai, ''sarkaar chaahati he ki eemaandaaree se tex bharne vaale or safed kamai par jeene waalon ko or pareshaan kare
 Interest rates have already been reduced in banks and other savings channels
 or ab pief par kanchi chalaai ja rahi he
 Governments ultimately want to push people into risky investments in open markets such as stock markets and mutual funds
 ''lekin kai logon ne ipief par byaaj dar kam karne ke faisle kaa swaagat kiya he
 Sonu Iyer, tax partner of EY, a professional services company, says the interest rate of EPF is 8, given the declining interest rate on fixed deposits and PPF etc
 7 kii ghoshnaa swaagat yogya kadam he
 In such a situation, it seems that the government wants to end the attraction of EPF, but due to the fixed profits, people do not want to shift to NPS
 ipief se enpies main shift hone kii ijaajat dene vaala sanshodhan taiyaar he
 But Hemant Contractor, chairman of Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority, which runs the NPS, believes that EPF subscribers can forego NPS due to tax
 darasal, ipief lokapriyata kii ek badi vajah nivesh ke duusare madon main ghatata munafa he
 The government has reduced the interest rates on various savings schemes like Post Office, Life Insurance, Fixed Deposit, Kisan Vikas Patra, National Savings Scheme
 iske alaava, inamen kabhi bhi paisa nikaalane kii chhot nahin he
 Not only this, 60% of the amount is taxed in the NPS that the government is giving priority to
 der-saber ipief par bhi kisi na kisi rup main yah tex laga diya jayega
 The EPFO may have fixed the rate of interest on the advice of the government, but the employees have their doubts that the government's intention is to reduce its gross earnings
 ipief yaa enpies kise chune or kyonendie sarkaar kii gaiyr-sarkari karmchaariyon kii karmchaaree bhavishya nidhi (ipief) or saath hi rashtriya pension yojana (enpies) main jamaa sevanivritti dhanrashi par kar lagane ke haal ke bajet prastaavon ko enpies ko badhaava dene vaale kadam ke taur par dekha gaya
 This discussion does not include the General Public Provident Fund (GPF) which is in force and for which no change in the budget has been offered
 aaie sevanivritti se judi do yojanaon—ipief or enpies ko badhaava dene, kar laabhon or rakam nikaalane ke vikalpon ko samajhen
 If there is EPF, then why the emphasis on NPS is being emphasized, it is evident from many things, such as exemption of 40% of the amount deposited in NPS account at the time of retirement and 60% of the balance in EPF is taxable
 Proposal of is kadam kii vajahen dikhaai detii hai
 The government wants to move away from assured pension schemes to the contribution scheme
 pehle kii vyavastha main yogadan dene vaale ko nunatam pension kaa bharosa diya jaataa tha chaahe uskaa yogadan bahut kam hi kyon na ho, jabaki anshdaan yojana main karmchaaree die gaye yogadan ke aadhaar par laabhon kaa adhikari hota he
 Currently, the employee's contribution to EPF is fully tax-free up to 12% of salary and there is no limit on the total amount
 bajet main is par 1
 50 lakhs
 kii seemaa tay karne kaa or is tarah karmchaaree ke haath main aane vaale atirikt yogadan ko kar yogya banane kaa prastaav kiya gaya he
 At the same time, there is no maximum limit of contribution of the employee under NPS as long as the contribution does not exceed 10% of the salary of the employee
 is par bhi koi adhiktam seemaa lagu karne kaa prastaav nahin rakhaa gaya he
 Not only this, under the EPF scheme, the employer cannot pay more than the employee's contribution to the EPF, while there is no such restriction under the NPS
 yahaan tak ki enpies main karmchaaree or niyokta, donon ke liye yogadan dena jaruri nahin he
 In this way, employees falling in the highest tax slab can make excellent tax planning through NPS
 masalan, 1 karod kii tankhwaah vaale shakchas ke liye niyokta 10 fisadi yani 10 lakh ru
 Can contribute to which the employee can avail tax exemption, which is not present in case of EPF
 ipief main karmchaaree ke yogadan par 1
 50 lakhs
 tak 80 si ke tahat katautee kaa phayda liya ja saktaa he
 Similarly 1 on employee's contribution to NPS also
 50 lakh ru
 Upto 80 CCD (1) gets the benefit of deduction
 ye donon katautiyaan 80 sisii ke tahat 1
 50 lakhs
 kii seemaa ke adheen hai
 However if 1 in employee NPS
 50 lakh ru
 50,000 and above the basic limit of Rs
 kaa yogadan detaa he to 80 sisidi(1bi) ke tahat atirikt katautee kaa laabh le saktaa he
 This additional deduction is not present on contribution to EPF
 enpies ke tahat khatadharak ke liye ritairement ke vakt yaa badhaai gai avadhi ke khatm hone par kul rakam kii kam se kam 40 fisadi rakam se kisi beemaa company se aneuity khareednaa anivaary he
 The remaining amount has to be taxed at the moment, but the budget proposes to make 40 percent of the remaining amount tax-free and to make only 20 percent of the amount immediately taxable
 agar karmchaaree kul rakam kii 60 fisadi rakam se aneuity kharid letaa he to is kar ke boj se bhi bachaa ja saktaa he
 Presently, the accumulated outstanding balance of EPF is tax-free along with interest accrued therein till the maturity period
 rakam nikaalane ke niyamajahan tak ipief se rakam nikaalane kii baat he, to sarkaar ne iske saath bhi khilwaad karne kii koshish kii gai or farvari 2016 main ek aadesh jari kiya ki karmchaaree niyokta ke yogadan ko sevanivritti se pehle nahin nikaal saktaa
 It is good that this order was finally withdrawn
 philhal sthiti yah he ki ipief khate main jamaa bakaayaa rakam nikaali ja sakati he basharte aap bakaayaa rakam kaa ek niyokta se duusare niyokta main tabadalaa na karavaaen
 However, if such withdrawal is made before the completion of five years of contribution under the same employer or another employer, the amount withdrawn becomes taxable and if the amount withdrawn is Rs
 30,000
 se zyada he, jise badhaakar 50,000 ru
 It is proposed to cut tax at the rate of 10 per cent
 jahaan tak enpies kii baat he, to 2015 main rakam nikasi ke niyamon main sanshodhan kiye jane se pehle enpies khate se adhabich rakam nikaalane ke koi praavdhaan nahin the
 However, these were changed and it was allowed to withdraw 25 per cent of the outstanding amount to make it partially in line with the Provident Fund Scheme
 to bhi is nikasi kii paatrata keval karmchaaree ke yogadan or usase hone vaali aamadani tak hi simit he
 Earlier it was necessary for the employee to withdraw money when he was 60 years old, but according to the revised rules, the employee can defer withdrawal for three years
 saath hi vah 70 saal kii umr tak yogadan jari rakhane kaa vikalp bhi chun saktaa he
 It is clear from the above discussion that NPS is still a great opportunity for tax planning for high-paid individuals, especially when the proposed limit of employer's contribution to EPF in the budget is going to be withdrawn
 There is no proposal yet
 in donon main se kisi ke liye koun zyada acha he, yah vyakti vishesh kii sthiti par nirbhar he

 ek varisht police adhikari ne ke mutabik, "unke khilaafkashmirghati main kathith rup se sainya karrwai kii galat soochna twit karne ke liye bhartiya dand samhita kii dhara 124-e(deshadroh), 153-e(dushmani ko badhaava dena), 504(jaanboojhkar shanti bhang karne ke iraade se apmaan karne) or 505(updrav karwaane ke liye bayaan dene) ke tahat maamla darj karaayaa gaya he
 a complaint was filed against him by advocate Alakh Alok Srivastava of the Supreme Court
 "(agency se input) Uma Bharti is such a fiery leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party that even if she remains silent, controversies do not stop her pursuit
 madhya pradesh kii mukhyamantri rah chukin uma philhal uttar pradesh kii jhaansi loksabhaa seat se saansad hai or modi sarkaar main kendriya jal sansaadhan evam ganga vikaas mantri hai
 The latest controversy is about the Pradhan Mantri Adarsh gram Yojana where, every time she chooses a village which is not fit for this scheme to make Adarsh
 adarsh banane laayak gaanv kii uma bharti kii khoj apane aap main ek aisa kissa ban gai he, jo puri yojana ke hawaii charitra ko ujagar kar detii he
 Before anything is said, hear from Uma Bharti's mouth how she is searching for the ideal village
 sadhvi kahati hai, ''yojana kii ghoshnaa hote hi maine lalitpur jile ke maharauni block ke behad pichde gaanv sadakura ko pradhanmantri kii apekshaaon ke anuroop adarsh gaanv banane ke liye chunaa
 "uma," he said, creating a plan to make this village a model for three months 
 lekin jab kaam shuru karne kaa vakt aayaa to unhen bataaya gaya ki gaanv kii aabaadi adarsh gaanv banane ke liye nirdhaarit maandand se kam he
 Also, the question arose that this is his ancestral village
 is sawaal par ve kahati hai, ''haa saat-aath peedi pehle hamaare purakhe is gaanv main rahete the
 When i told this thing to the Prime Minister myself, he said that it does not matter
 '' vaise bhi uma bharti kaa paitruk nivas ab lalitpur se sate madhya pradesh ke tikamgarh jile main he or ve vahiin pali-badi hai
 So, instead of being an ancestral village, Sadhaura devoured the criteria of population
 phir charchaa ai ki uma bharti ne jhaansi shahar se sate srinagar gaanv ko adarsh gram ke taur par god liya he
 Confirming by Jhansi DM Anurag Yadav, "uma Bharti was the first to choose Srinagar, but it had to be removed due to coming into the metropolitan area
" '' haalanki srinagar gaanv kii kahani bayaan karte hue didi kahati hai, ''aap to jaanate hai ki srinagar gaanv cantonment ilaake main padataa he
 The village has not been developed due to entry into the military zone and all the four roads connecting the village have deteriorated
 isliye is gaanv ko maine aise hi god le liya
 "it has nothing to do with Prime Minister Adarsh village
" to is tarah do gaanvon ke adarsh banane kii katha samaapt hui
 After this Uma Bharti decided that now the village will be made ideal, which will meet the standards in every way
 is kaam main ab unhen kisi tarah kii hila-hawali manjuur nahin thi
 After that, he chose village Pawa adjacent to Talbehat town in Lalitpur district
 ganga ke uddhaar ke liye raajnneeti karne kaa dam bharne vaali mantri ne kaha, ''iske baad maine lalitpur jile ke jiladhikari or party ke jiladhyaksh ko sahi gaanv kaa chayan karne kii jimmedaari de di
 Only after this, the village of Pawa was selected
 main na to chunaav prachaar ke dauraan is gaanv main gai or na yojana main chayan se pehle yah gaanv dekha tha
 "come here and if you are thinking that the delayed Ayad is better, then please be patient
" asal kahani to pava gaanv se hi shuru hoti he
 Jain Tirtha Pawa is adjacent to Talbehat town of Lalitpur district
 yah jhaansi loksabhaa kshetra ke daayre main aane vaale 1,200 gaanvon main sabase viksit gaanvon main se ek najar aata he
 It has been declared Ambedkar village in 2000
 mayawati sarkaar main adarsh gaanv ko ambedkar gaanv hi kaha jaataa tha or iske liye vishesh fund jari hote the
 There are already 7 government schools in this village, cutting the ears of big villages
 inamen se paanch primary or do junior haai skool hai
 Apart from this, the state government has also approved the inter college here
 college kii imaarat kaa nirmaan jald shuru hoga
 There is also a polytechnic college on the outskirts of the village
 swasthya sevaaon ke nazariye se dekhen to gaanv main ek eenem centre he
 So women do not have to go out of the village for delivery
 gaanv kii e
 N
 em
 Lakshmi Tiwari says, "I am available to serve people for 24 hours
 '' gaanv main gram panchayat sachivalay he or sachiv gaanv main hi rahen, iske liye unka sarkari awaas bhi bana he
 The village also has post offices, forest department post, vegetable market and Ayurvedic hospital
 gaanv main teen talab hai or ek talab to itnaa bada he ki sinchai vibhaag ne isse nahar nikaal rakhi he
 Already 80 Indira houses have been built for the poor in the village and 16 are under construction
 takreeban sabhi sadaken pakki hai, haalanki inamen se kuch kii haalat kharaab he
 Due to being a Jain pilgrimage, there is arrangement for hundreds of people to stay in the big Dharamshala here
 ab isi viksit gaanv ko uma bharti adarsh gaanv banane main juty hai
 Lalitpur DM Zuhair bin Sagir was asked why he gave a glittering village to make Uma Bharti ideal, he said, "the ideal village has to be chosen by the MP"
 meraa kaam to mandandon ke bare main unhen suchit karne bhar kaa he
 "that is, both the MP and DM are shying away from the responsibility of choosing the ideal village
" iske baad jab dm se poocha gaya ki chaliye viksit hi sahi, lekin adarsh gram ke tahat ab yahaan nayaa kya ho rahaa he, to unka jawaab or dilachasp tha, ''pradhanmantri adarsh gram yojana ke tahat gaanv ko alag se koi bajet nahin diya jaataa
 Under this, already running schemes can be implemented more actively
 '' jiladhikari ne spasht kiya ki is yojana ko pradesh main chal rahi lohia gram yojana kii tarah na mana jaae
 Under Lohia village extra money is given for the development of the village, there is no separate money arrangement in Adarsh village
 aise main le-dekar pradhanmantri adarsh gram ke paas saansad kshetra vikaas nidhi kaa hi sahaara he
 But Zuhair admits, "no plan was passed through the MP fund for Pawa through me
 ''gaanv kii pradhan vineeta rajak dukhada roti hai, ''ham to sochate the ki uma didi ne gaanv ko chunaa he, to vikaas ke kaam honge
 But no development work has been done till now, i am tired of getting the officers' platoon made tea-snacks
 '' pradhanmantri adarsh gram yojana kaa vijan document padhein to lagata he ki yah yojana jaise hi amal main aegi, gaanv mahatma gandhi ke aatmanirbhar gaanv main badal jaaenge
 But here the whole plan looks like an antelope
 uma safagoi kii kaayal hai, isliye unhone sachhee kahani bataa di, baaki gaanvon kii adarsh gaatha bhi pradhanmantri ko shaayad jaldi hi sunai de jaae

 desh kaa kaaleen udyog bhi notebandi kii chapet main aa gaya he
 The weavers are leaving work due to lack of cash and all the people associated with this industry are facing the brunt of Muflisi due to scarcity of goods with the traders engaged in this work
 bunakar udyog kaa garh kahe jane vaale bhadohi, mirzapur, panipat aadi jagahen, jo kabhi hathkarghon kii aawaaj se gulzaar hua karti thim, vahaan in dinon sannata pasra hua he

 Dinesh Kumar, president of the Export Promotion Council for Handicrafts, says that the government should raise the existing limit to withdraw cash from the bank from 50,000 to 2 to 3 lakh every week so that traders have more money to give to the weavers
 agar sarkaar yah faisla karti he to aane vaale dinon main halaat sudhar sakate hai
 Now everyone is waiting for the government's initiative in the weaver industry

 The Congress has played a big bet before the Gujarat assembly elections
 congress ne bijepi ke khilaaf milakar chunaav ladane ke liye patidaar netaa hardik patel samet duusare yuva netaaon ko saath aane kaa nyotaa diya
 At the same time, the anti-bjp poles have been invited to come together
 patidaar netaa hardik patel ne 'aaj tak' se kaha he ki ve congress ko samarthan dene ke liye taiyaar hai
 Hardik has spoken of support on the basis of issues and expressed confidence that Congress will obey him
 hardik ke kareebi main BJP main shamilis bich shanivaar kii shaam patidaar samaaj ke do leaders reshma patel or varun patel ne ahmedabad main amit shah se mulaakaat ke baad BJP jwine kar lee
 Both of these are considered close to Hardik
 'bijepi main shaamil hone ke baad patidaar netaaon ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha ki hardik ‘congress kaa agent’ ban gaya he or maujuuda rajya sarkaar ko ukhaad phenkane ke liye andolan kaa istemaal karne kaa prayaas kar rahaa he
 Reshma Patel said, "our movement was about reservation under OBC quota
 yah bijepi ko ukhadkar uski jagah congress ko satta main laane ke liye nahin tha
 Where BJP has always supported the community and has accepted most of our demands
 congress sirf patelon ko vot bank ke taur par istemaal karne kaa prayaas kar rahi he
 We do not want to be part of such a malicious plot
 ’’apane do kaaryakartaaon dwaara bijepi kaa daaman tham lene par hardik patel ne twit kiya ki ''cankhajurah ke pair tut jane ke baavjood bhi canakhajurah dodega !! meren saath janata hai
 i will keep fighting till the public is with me !! ''
 is twit ke madhyam se hardik ne yah sandesh diya kii ki bijepi dwaara team ko kamjor karne kii koshish ke baavjood bijepi ke khilaaf unki ladaai main janata unke saath he
 Let us tell you that Reshma Patel, the female leader of the Patidar movement, had already made up her mind to withdraw from the movement
 april main jab hardik jail main band the
 At that time, he issued a letter from the jail and told about the authorized spokespersons of the Patidar Reservation Movement Committee (PASS)
 usamen reshma patel kaa naam nahin tha
 After this, Reshma said sadly that she is sad that my name is not in the new list nearby
 reshma ne aage kaha tha ki ''samaaj ke liye ab tak kaary karne main unka raajnneetik yaa vyaktigat swaarth nahin tha
 "he had also said that Hardik is imprisoned in jail, so many people would have told him only half the thing about me
" isi ke chalate hardik kaa mujh par se vishwaas uth gaya hoga
 Earlier, Hardik said that he has agreed to support the Congress to defeat the BJP, but also said that he will give support only when the Congress agrees to their terms
 vahiin dalit netaa jignesh mevani ne kaha he ki samvidhan virdohi bijepi ko har haal main hataanaa he
 Gujarat Congress President Bharat Singh Solanki has publicly sent these invitations to anti-bjp leaders
 solanki ne janata dal united ke netaa chotu bhai vasava ko bhi saath aane kaa nimantran bheja he
 Vasava is the same leader who claimed to vote against Congress candidate Ahmed Patel in the Rajya Sabha election by going against the party line
 wo patel ke kaaphi kareebi maane jate hai
 Apart from these, Alpesh Thakor, leader of the OBC SC-ST Ekta Manch and Jignesh Mevani, who have voiced harassment against Dalits, have also been invited to join the Congress
 is elaan ke saath hi solanki ne ye bhi kaha ki chunaav ke liye sabhi vikalp khule hai
 He said that the leaders who want to contest elections on the symbol of Congress are also welcome
 saath hi agar wo swatantra rup se chunaav main janaa chaahate hai, to congress unhen samarthan dene ke liye taiyaar he
 Hardik had made this tweet, just hours before the announcement of the Congress, Patidar leader Hardik Patel had announced not to contest on Twitter
 unhone twit main likhaa, 'mujhe chunaav nahin ladanaa or chunaav ladane kaa hamaara swaarth bhi nahin he
 We need rights and justice, we are fighting in front of the ego
 jeet hamaari hogi'
 Hardik has also announced this on the stage of Aaj Tak
 unhone panchayat ajtak main umr kam hone kaa hawala dete hue chunaav na ladane kii baat kahi thi
 i do not contest elections and we do not have any interest in contesting elections
 hamen adhikaar chahie or nyaay,ham ahankaar ke saamne lard rahen hai
 The victory will be ours — Hardik Patel (@hardikpatel_) This announcement of Alpesh's rally Congress on October 21, 201723 comes at a time when OBC SC-ST Ekta Manch convener Alpesh Thakor is going to be held in Ahmedabad on October 23
 is raily ko 'janadesh sammelan' kaa naam diya gaya he
 The importance of OBC votes in Gujarat's electoral battle, it is clear from this that 54 per cent of the state is OBC, or the most backward class
 yahi vajah he ki alpesh chunavi chausar par apane daanv bahut chaturaai se chal rahe hai
 Alpesh is claiming that more than 5 lakh people will take part in this rally
 alpesh isi raily main gujarat vidhansabha chunaav ke liye apni ranneeti kii ghoshnaa karenge
 Read, what did Hardik Patel, Alpesh Thakor and Jignesh Mevani say in Panchayat Aaj Tak? Actually, Alpesh has announced every possible effort to defeat BJP from public forums
 vahiin patidaaron kii aarakshan maang puri na hone se naaraaz chal rahe patidaar netaa hardik patel bhi bijepi ke khilaaf khuleam morcha khol chuke hai
 On the other hand, Jignesh Mevani has come out loud against the oppression of Dalits in Gujarat
 aise main ye teenon yuva netaa sidhe taur par bijepi ke liye chunauti bane hue hai
 This is the reason that the Congress is working on a strategy to end the 22-year drought in Gujarat by bringing together these young leaders who support different caste equations

 com / 3ioodthspo — Hamid Mir (@hamidmirpak) April 3, 2018 Let's say that the condition of journalists in Pakistan is very bad these days
 julm or bhrashtachar ke khilaaf aawaaj uthaane waalon ko sidhe goli maar di ja rahi he
 Recently a journalist was shot dead by unknown assailants in Rawalpindi
 maare gaye patrkaar kaa naam anjum muner raja he
 He was 40 years old
 police ne bataaya tha ki anjum der raat bike se apane ghar laut rahe the
 At the same time, the attackers shot him
 yah ghatana pakistani sena ke rashtriya mukhyalay ke paas bank road par hui thi
 Six bullets were fired on Anjum's head, neck and other parts of the body
 isse anjum kii maukey par hi maut ho gai
 The same month, two journalists were brutally murdered in India
 bihar ke bhojpur jile main do patrakaron ko scorpiyo gaadi se buree tarah kuchal diya gaya
 At the time of the incident, the two journalists were returning by coverage of the Ram Navami procession
 is maamle main purv mukhiya ke pati mohammad harsu ko police ne giraftaar kar liya tha
 At the same time, Mohammed Harsu's son W
 Mian was surrendered in court after absconding for several days
 purv mukhiya ke pati mohammad harsu or patrkaar naveen nishchal ke bich kisi khabar ko lekar vivaad ho gaya
 After this Harsu threatened Naveen to bear the brunt
 ramanavami juluus ke kawarej se naveen or vijay ghar laut rahe the
 They were surrounded on the way
 harsu or uske bete ne apni scorpiyo gaadi se naveen kii bike main jor daar takkar maari
 If both fell down, they were crushed by the car and killed them
 iske baad aaropee vahaan se faraar hone lage
 When the villagers got information, they rushed to the spot
 logon ne gaadi ko aag ke hawaale kar diya
 The show 'yeh Rishta Kya Kehlata Hai' started on January 12, 2009 on Star Plus
 jab ye sho shuru hua tha, kisi ne sochaa bhi nahin tha ki ye serial logon ke dilon par is tarah raaj karegaa
 The idol of simplicity caught the chemistry of Akshara (hina Khan) and the straightforward boy Naitik (karan Mehra)
 din par din sho kii kahani badhati gai or sho tiarapy bhi usee speed se badhati gai
 It has been 10 years for this serial
 serial kii starcast lagbhag puri tarah se badal gai he
 Hina Khan and Karan Mehra's love story got a break and their children's love story has gained momentum
 sho main ab naira (shivangi joshi) or karthik (mohsin khan) mukhya bhumikaon main hai
 The love story of both is being shown
 pyaar kii shuruyaat se lekar shaadi tak or phir shaadi main aane vaali pareshaaniyon se kaise nipta jaaen, sabhi baarikiyon ko sho main behad shandaar tareeke se dikhaaya ja rahaa he
 For so many years, the show has dominated the TV world
 puraane kirdaaron sho se agsit hue or nae kairactor introdeus kiye gaye
 All the twists and turns were brought
 sho aksar top 10 serial kii list main bhi shumaar rahata he
 But still some of the shows are missing 
 darasal, sho kii kahani main bahut zyada ripitesan ho gaya he
 At times it seems as if the same plot is being shown from different angles
 hina khan or karan mehara kii lav story main bhi unhen baar-baar alag karke saath laane kii kahani or ab shivangi joshi or mohsin khan kii lav story main bhi vahi sab dikhaaya ja rahaa he
 Kartik and Naira have been separated on the show no matter how many times
 unka brallep kar diya gaya or phir unhen ek kar diya jaataa he
 Not only this, every time they get married
 unke brallep ko itane dinon tak chalaaya jaataa he ki phens donon ke reunion ke liye taras jate hai
 Seeing the same kind of plot again and again is getting bored
 phens sho se kuch naepan kii maang kar rahe hai
 When the show started, every character was given importance
 ab lagata he karthik- naira ke alaava sho main koi or he ki nahin
 Even the story of the show is being dragged so much that the characters of the show are leaving serial after serial
 jab kuch nayaa dikhaane ke liye nahin hota he to sho main lip laa diya jaataa he or karthik-naira main takaraar ho jaati he
 Recently, several important characters exited the show
 parul chouhan, mohina singh, deblina chatterjee ne sho chhod diya he
 Now there are reports of Shrestha and Shubh Saxena also leaving the show
 sho kii kahani main bhi kuch badlaav najar nahin aa rahaa he
 Sometimes so much love is shown between Karthik and Naira that they cannot digest, sometimes there is so much hatred or suspicion between the two that upon seeing the head starts turning
 in dinon phir se serial main 5 saal kaa lip aa gaya he
 Naira and Karthik are separated
 naira ek bete kii maa ban gai hai or karthik se dur rah rahi hai
 It will have to be seen whether this leap will be able to spread the magic like it came in the serial

 Amit Kumar Jha has been the production manager of Claycraft India Private Limited for the last ten years, but his experience in this field has never been bad
 1995 se hi ceremic udyog kaa hissaa hote hue amit kumaar kaa maananaa he ki yah udyog apane sabase bure daur se guzar rahaa he
 Production manager Amit Kumar Jha told India Today, 'I have been involved with the bone china industry since 1995

 It was very good and was going well
 lekin aaj kii sthiti yah he ki yah vyavsaay dhire dhire neeche kii ore ja rahaa he

 aarthik mandi ke boj tale yah udyog ladkadaa rahaa he or nikat bhavishya main is sankat kaa samaadhaan najar nahin aa rahaa he
 If the government did not take adequate remedial steps to encourage this industry, if the negative sentiment prevailing everywhere was not relieved, then the ceramic industry of Rajasthan would get worse
 clecraft india privet limited ke diarector bharat agarwal ne india today se baatcheet main kaha, 'nishchit taur par yah bartan udyog bhi aarthik mandi jhel rahe vyavsaayon kaa hissaa he or hamaara bazaar dhimaa chal rahaa he

 But now we are forced to take out our stock
 agar agle 15 dinon main sthiti main sudhaar nahin hota he to yah ind stry ke liye behad bura samay hoga
 i estimate that if the situation does not improve within the next one month, 25 to 35 percent of the businesses will be closed
 'ceremic udyog main anischitata kaa daur?jaankaron kaa kahana he ki agar aarthik mandi jari rahi to rajasthan main ceremic udyog lambey samay ke liye anischitata ke daur main chalaa jayega

 sirf ceremic udyog hi nahin, dawa or khaanaa chhodkar har vyavsaay mandi kii chapet main he
 "he further says," Personally i feel the way the government had helped us last time, now the government should take initiative again
 sarkaar ko indonesia, china se aayaat band kar dena chahie
 People are very scared
 log paise bachaa rahe hai ki kal pataa nahin kya ho
 'experts say that if concrete measures are not taken immediately, the industry will come to a standstill
 unka kahana he ki rajasthan kii ceremic industry main ai is mandi ke peeche notebandi, jiesti kaa galat kriyanvayan, arthvyavastha main nagative centement hai jiske chalate ek bade tabake main logon kii kharid kshamta kam hui he

 sam born kaa 2017 kaa ek thriller he—tu kil da president
 It begins with a tremendous uproar in the White House
 iskaa star uttar korea or china par parmaanu hamalaa karne ja rahaa he—uttar korea ne use 'kaayar or ochhaa aadmi' kahkar taana maaraa he
 This fictional president of Bourne is a strange man — heavy, bumbling, bursting on Twitter, a woman's favorite and a fan of Fox News
 asal duniya main donald trump chhuttiyaan manaakar laute hai or unhone 2018 ke apane shuruaati kuch din twitor par videshi sarkaron par hamale karte hue bitaye hai
 They condemn Pakistan for its 'lies and fraud' and the support of the terrorists
 ve iran or falstiniyon kii laanat-malaanat karte hai
 The President then turns his attention to North Korea, whose leader has just spoken of having a 'nuclear button' on his desk
 ve kehete hai—he, meraa batan tumhaare batan se bahut bada he
 Then they extend their hands towards the phone
 ''kya uski taar-taar hoti or bhukhon marati sarkaar main koi use meharbaani karke batayega ki mere paas bhi ek newclear batan he, par ye unke batan se kahin zyada bada or zyada taqatvar he, meraa batan kaam bhi karata he!'' ye wo twit tha, jo bilkul asal america raashtrapati nchahmdgaddasthshathddaysranjahmhvadwasch, ne kiya tha
 This left the State Department to tinker its head as usual and rub the eyes with disbelief and astonishment
 aadhunik soshal media ke uttar-satya yug ne hakeekat or kisse-kahani, asaliyat or nakal ke bich kii lakiron ko buree tarah dhundhala kar diya he
 But this is certain: Social media has become the central platform
 mukhyadhara kaa media (apane udaaravaadi vimarsh ke saath) hamale kii jad main he
 World leaders make their point via Twitter, from President Trump to Prime Minister Modi — who have completely abandoned the press conference and talk 'directly to the people' in broadcasting via radio and Twitter
 soshal media ek vaikalpik abhaasi falak muhaiyaa karata he
 The alternatives are dismissed by Mukhtadhara's media, mainstream bureaucrats, even mainstream feminism, as the 'awakened' neo-feminist List of 2017 equipped with the strength of the leftist-liberal and upper caste
 2017 kii vah suchi vidhyaarthiyon ne taiyaar kii thi jisamen yon pratadia ke aaropee, zyaadaatar gumnaam, purush adhyetaon ke naam (shuruyaat main 60) the
 Liberal (argumentative?) Feminist voices questioned leading scholars through anonymous accusations to shatter without any evidence or evidence or genuine complaint
 bhartiya nariwad kaa taar-taar hona mukhar or use sunanaa takalifdeh tha
 In our entire world of social media full of glory, in 2018, there will be more officers like this, whether for good or bad
 kyonki hindustan ke paas sabase badi mobile aabaadi ke saath sabase vyast soshal media falak bhi he
 2019 battleground: a year ago the hot and spirited contest of the general election of Hindustan will be spread on digital media, with most of the contest on whatsapp, Twitter and Facebook
 in bhidnton or karravaayiyon main phek news, trol fujen, dhur-rashtrawaad or ve tamaam aajamaae hue tareeke bhi shaamil honge, jinhone 2017 main dakshinpanth ko america or hindustan sahit hamaare chote-se grah par ubharne or phoolne-phalne main madad kii thi
 These clashes will be around the entire political plank, in which in the last five years, as usual, we will have a weak opposition fighting against the digital power of the ruling party
 2018 main chunaav-purv hindustan par jabardast dhyaan dene waalon main fasebuk hoga, jiske paas duniya bhar main apane plateformon par siyaasi dalon ko prashikshan dene vaali samarpit timen hai
 Among these will also be Twitter, whose growth in global users and revenue slowed down last year and for which India is very important
 phek news ke kaarkaanon kii bahaar aa jaaegi—ve suniyojit or rupye-paise kii gatividhiyaan bhi chalaayenge or anaupchaarik kaamkaaj bhi, jise kutir-udyog ke manind vitaran network kaa samarthan hasil hoga
 But the focus will slowly shift to the video
 chote-chote gati avarohakah fact-chekars yani tathyon kii jaanch-padtaal karne vaali websitenkrunchakchashashadvarudb1dg-dbath, nchradyahlahridg2hy, or aisi hi duusari—or zyada vyast ho jaaengi
 For those who investigate the facts, the real epic of 2019 will be unmatched when they can get more vibe, thrill and even Mali subsidies
 agle 10 karod yujar hindustan main march 2019 tak online aa jaaenge
 About 7 by 2020, descending further down the socio-economic pyramid
 30 karod raste par honge
 One-third of the new users will be youngsters with smartphones; The rest will be older, less literate, less expensive users
 ve zyaadaatar video main ramenge, text yaa likhi hui ibaaraton main nahin: isliye whatsap or messanger kii praasangikta bani rahegi
 Live streaming video will be the top trend of social media in India in 2018, spanning all levels of literacy and across all ages
 soshal media ke jariye nigaraanee or jasusi main ijapha hoga
 Indian intelligence agencies and law enforcement agencies keep a close watch on social media, but they lag far behind China and even the US in the use of tools to monitor user talk
 china siyaasi niyantran ke liye un par najar rakhata he or america kathith taur par kanoon lagu karne ko homeland suraksha ke liye
 wechat, such as China's whatsapp, has more than 90 million users
 magar is ap kii maalik tencent yujar data ikattha, monitor or china kii sarkaar ke saath saajha karti he
 Criticized posts are blocked or deleted, and police have also arrested wechat users for posting messages criticizing the government
 bharat ke paas apane soshal mega-plateform nahin hai or sarkaar ko whatsap par (jiske messej encripted hai) yah sab karne kaa na to niyantran hasil he or na hi ye uske adhikaar kshetra main he
 Our agencies spend a lot of time on Facebook and they also use digital tools (and agencies) to search and analyze on social media (in addition to using these platforms for their own spread)
 2017 ke pehle chah maheenon main fasebuk ko data ke liye 9,853 argiyaan milin, jo ek saal pehle kii tulana main 56 fisadi zyada hai
 And i will conclude with an old saying on social media, which will continue to rule (and corporate or political power from which nothing will be learned)
 strisend soshal media kaa phenomena he, jisamen kisi cheez ko dabaane kaa anivaary asar yah hota he ki vah or zyada dur tak fail jaati he
 With the start of the new year, about half a dozen media houses took back stories that told how Twitter users mocked the upbeat and passionate speech of the son of the chairman of a giant corporate company
 dekhte hi dekhte, 10 din purana vah bhaashan, jo tab tak internet ke andhere digital konon main gum ho chukaa tha, dhamaake ke saath surkhiyon main laut aayaa
 In the era of the Internet, this applies to banned books or articles
 koi bhi cheez unhen online uchhaalkar utana ooncha nahin laati jitna unhen jameendoj karne kii koshishen laati hai
 If you want to make your 2018 film a hit, then get it banned a bit

 bijepi netaaon ko chunaav ke pehle apshagun kaa dar sata rahaa he
 The party leaders, who have announced the release of the list of candidates by September 15, are afraid that if the candidates are not announced by this date, the list will have to be released in Shraddhapaksha
 isiilie ab chunaav ladane ke icchhuk netaaon ne party haikaman se guhaar lagaai he ki ummidavaaron ke naamon kaa elaan shraadh ke pehle kar diya jaae
 Because according to Hindu belief no auspicious work is done during Shraddha Paksha
 dilli bijepi ke netaa 15 saal baad satta main vaapasi kaa sapana dekh rahe hai, lekin unhen shraadh paksh ke 15 din baari pad rahe hai
 The leaders fear that the party high command may not announce the names of the candidates in the patriarchy in a hurry , as no auspicious work is done during the Shraddha Paksha according to the Hindu calendar
 dilli bijepi ke pravaktaa harish khurana ke mutabik, 'party ko kai netaaon kaa aisa anurodh mila he ki shraadhpaksh ke dauraan ghoshnaa na karen, iske pehle kar den
 Because it is believed that these days do not do any auspicious work, but we have already said that by September 15, we will release the list, so the list has nothing to do with Shraddha
 '20 sitambar se shraadh paksh shuru ho rahe hai, aise main chunaav ladane ke daavedaar netaaon ko dar he ki agar party 15 sitambar kii tay taarikh tak naamon par aam sahmati nahin bana pai, to kahin maamla shraadhpaksh ke bich na khisak jaae
 Because many big leaders of the party also believe that in the last elections the party did not care about Shraddhapaksha and declared CM candidate
 haalanki dilli bijepi ke adhyaksh kaa daawa he ki list jaldi ghoshit karne ke peeche shraadh paksh vajah nahin he
 Delhi BJP President Vijay Goel said, 'now you have told yourself, we are doing it, but our list has nothing to do with Shraddha
 'dilli bijepi ke prabharee nitin gadakari kaa dabaav he ki pehali list jaldi se jaldi jari kar di jaae, lekin hakeekat ye he ki maujuuda vidhayakon kii siton par bhi party ke bheetar ghamaasan machaa hua he
 Drinking buttermilk of milk is also burnt, in the last elections, BJP had given Malhotra candidacy for the post of CM during Shraddha Paksha, but the party lost the election
 ab haar kii vajah jo bhi rahi hon, lekin bijepi is baar shraadh paksh se sahami hui he

 rio olympic se kareeb teen maheene pehle india today conklev- 2016 main charchaa olympic khelon or is ore bharat kii taiyaariyon ko lekar hui
 Abhinav Bindra, the shooter who shot gold at the Beijing Olympics, said during this time that he wanted to win gold in Beijing, but in Rio it was his need
 vahiin, badminton main team india ke neshnal coach gopichand pulela ne ummid jataai ki is baar badminton main bhi medal milegaa
 Speaking to India Today's consulting editor (sports) Boria Majumdar during the session on Thursday evening, Abhinav Bindra said, "even though the Olympics come in four years for the common man, the Olympics are held every day for the athletes
 ' abhinav bindra ne aage kaha ki athens main medal jeetna unke liye bahut myne rakhata tha, lekin vah saatven number par rahen
 He said, 'I wanted gold in Beijing, but in Rio it is what i need
 'dekhen, india today conklev 2016 live'cyna or sindhu acha khel rahe hai'kya aapako lagata he ki badminton main is baar olympic medal aa rahaa he? is sawaal kaa jawaab dete hue gopichand ne kaha, 'kaash yah sawaal jitna sidhaa or saral he, khel bhi utana hi saral or sidhaa hota
 We have time now and we sincerely hope that we will bring the medal
 ' unhone aage kaha ki cyna or sindhu donon bahut acha khel rahe hai
 Gopichand further said, 'focus is game for us
 ham medal jitate hai to ek desh rahete hai or agar nahin bhi jitate hai to ek desh rahete hai
 'need to see the game in a new way' Gopichand stressed the need for a fresh idea about the game in the country
 unhone kaha, 'jarurat he ki olympic se teen maheene pehle khel ko nae tareeke se dekha jaae
 There is a need to change the way we are playing or the way the game is being taken in our country
 nae tareeke se is ore sochane kii jarurat he
 Needs that people come forward to play
 ' abhinav bindra ne kaha ki hamen khel main yuvaaon ko protsaahit karne kii jarurat he
 India Today Conclave 2016 Program: Everyone needs to sit together: Badminton National Coach Gopichand further said that there is something happening at every level in schools, colleges and sports
 jarurat he ki ham saath baithe, soche, vichaar karen or ek sahi disha main aage bade
 He said, 'there are very good people in the sports ministry, who want to promote sports
 lekin jarurat he ki sab saath baithe
 Those who want to play in large numbers should be reached
 'khilaadi or khel kaa presreolampic khel ke dauraan pressure ke sawaal par bindra ne kaha, 'koi bhi super human nahin he
 Everyone lives in pressure
 yah ek myth he ki bhartiya athlites pressure nahin jhel sakate
 Everyone has pressure
 jab athlites ke paas acha foundation hota he, vah pressure ko jhel jaataa he
 But when this does not happen, a breakdown occurs
 yah human nechar he
 "need for Strategy" Gopichand Pullela said that strategy is very important to deal with pressure
 unhone kaha, 'jarurat he ki aap match se pehle or match ke baad kahen ki jeet yaa haar se fark nahin padataa
 You cannot sit with head-forehead tension
 du or daay jaisaa kuch nahin hota
 Ultimately this is the game
 ' lekin kya olympic final main koi is tarah soch saktaa he? is par bindra kehete hai, 'yah vyaktitv par nirbhar karata he
 It is important that you forget everything and pay attention to your day routine and game
 yah mushkil kaam he, lekin focus jaruri he
 "bindra's preparations for Rio", referring to the Olympic Games and his preparations, Bindra says, "I love it
" main har vah kaam karata hum, jo main kar saktaa hum
 The mantra for the Olympic medal for me is that you chase the target
 aap haarate hai, aap jitate hai
 You lose you win
 lagaataar prayaas karen
 ' srilanka ke khilaaf pehle test match main haar ke baad se team india ke prabandhan par gussaye purv cricketer sunil gavaskar ne team prabandhan par phir hamalaa bolaa he
 This time Gavaskar has strongly criticized batsman Ajinkya Rahane for changing the batting order in the ongoing second Test match in Colombo
 gavaskar ne kii kadi aalochananjiky rahane ko tisare number par utaarne ke bhartiya team prabandhan ke faisle kii kadi aalochana karte hue purv captain sunil gavaskar ne kaha ki think tanks ne kabhi shikaayat nahin karne vaale ek cricketer kaa balidaan kar diya
 Rahane has been placed at number five in the Test matches but the team management changed the batting order for the second Test match against Sri Lanka to bring Rahane to third and Rohit Sharma to fifth
 team prabandhan ne rahane ke saath galat kiyagavaskar ne kaha, 'unhone ek achche insaan kaa balidaan kar diya
 He is a very calm and nice person who does not say anything
 jab vah paanchaven number par safal ho rahaa tha tab use number teen par bhej diya
 It was difficult for him
 lekin use vah karnaa hoga jo jarurat hogi
 He comes from Rahul Dravid School
 rahul bhi number teen or paanch par ballebaaji karata rahaa he
 He is a mentor of Rahane and he will do the same
 'kabhi shikaayat nahin karte rahaanegavaskar ne aage kaha, 'yadi viraat number chaar par ballebaaji karata he to number teen charchaa ke liye khulaa he
 Rahane has a habit of reaching the ball
 usne newjiland or dakshin africa main aisa kiya
 It would have been better if he had batted at number four or five while the ball did not cause much damage
 vah apane chote kariyar main bhartiya cricket kaa vafaadaar or kabhi shikaayat nahin karne vaala khilaadi ban gaya he
 'it is noteworthy that on the first day of the second Test in Colombo, Rahane was dismissed by scoring only four runs while Lokesh Rahul scored 108, Kohli 78 and Rohit Sharma scored 79 runs
 gavaskar yuva openar rahul se kaaphi prabhavit dikhe
 Sunny is impressed with Rahul, he said, 'he plays very sparingly
 vah gend ke peeche sahi line par aata he
 He batted very effectively
 keval ek baat he ki vah aavesh main hook kar baithta he
 It is not a bad thing but he should be sure which ball to hit and which to drop
 ' gavaskar ne kaha ki rohit ne kariyar ko bachaane vaali pari kheli kyonki un par acha pradarshan karne ke liye kaaphi dabaav tha
 He said, 'he took full advantage of the opportunity
 kohli or rahul ke bich saajhedaari ban chuki thi or srilankai gendbaaj thake hue the
 It was the right time to bat
 input: bhashaa Since last few years, inflation has been taking a leap
 isaki aanch har jagah mahasoos kii ja sakati he
 Especially in the field of education
 ab har vyakti shiksha kii takat ko samakshata he
 There is no reliable data on the impact of inflation on education
 yah maang or aapurti ke aadhaar par tay hota he
 Government-run or government institutions are somewhat cheaper than private educational institutions
 abhibhavak apane bacchon ko acchhee-se-acchhee shiksha dena chaahate hai, lekin shaayad vah shiksha unki pahunch main nahin hoti
 That's why many people spend their retirement deposits
 abhibhavakon ko lagata he ki unhen hi bachche kii shiksha kaa sara boj uthaanaa he
 If they have enough resources then it is fine, but if it is not, then it becomes very difficult
 isliye hamen shiksha ke liye fund ke duusare vikalpon ko bhi aajmaana chahie
 Apart from the parents' money, there are three other options - scholarship, self-financing, and education loan
 puri yaa aanshik scolership shaayad sabase behatar vikalp he, magar yah bahut thode se medhaavi chaatro ko hi mil paati he
 After this comes the option of spending your own studies
 kai chaatr college main padhai or naukari saath-saath karte hai
 This should be encouraged as it helps the students to stand on their feet and experience real life
 yah un chaatro ke liye bhi madadgaar ho saktaa he, jo videsh main padhuya chaahate hai kyonki videsh ke kai collejon main chaatr bataur research assistant yaa gaiyr-shikshakeey kaam kar sakate hai
 They can also spend their education by working outside the college
 haalanki sabase vyavhaarik vikalp shaayad ajukeshan lone he
 Many banks and financial institutions give education loans and it is not difficult to get it
 isse chaatro main yah aparaadh bodh bhi nahin hota ki ve shiksha ke liye apane abhibhavakon par ashrith hai
 It is more likely that the student will feel more responsibility and take his education seriously
 jab vah kamaane lagegaa to uski phijulkharchi par is ehsaas se lagaam lagegi ki use karj lautaanaa he
 On the other hand, the parents will not even feel guilt that they could not provide good education to the child due to lack of money
 aaie jaane ki ajukeshan lone kya he
 Eligibility Education loans are available for degrees, diplomas and professional courses from autonomous institutions in addition to state and central specialized institutions
 videshi pratishthit sansthaanon ke rojgarparak, profeshnal course or snatkotar paathyakramon ke liye bhi uplabdh
 Education loan in Rashidesh 10 lakhs
 tak or videsh main padhai ke liye 30 lakh rupye tak mil jaataa he
 This includes tuition fees, examination fees, laboratory fees, equipment, stationery and computer expenses
 videsh main padhai ke liye isamen yatra or thaharne kaa kharch bhi shaamil hota he
 Mortgage bank 4 lakh Rs
 or kuch maamalon main 7 lakh ru
 Some do not demand mortgages for loans, but demand guarantors and mortgages for large sums of money, real estate, fixed deposits, post office savings schemes or insurance policies
 punarbhugtankarj 10 yaa 12 saal kii avadhi main chukaana hota he
 In many cases it is not to be given for a period
 masalan, course puraa hone ke chah maheene baad yaa rojgaar mil jane tak
 Interest rate between 13 and 15 percent
 kar bachatejukeshan lone kaa ek phayda yah he ki aath saal tak byaaj kii puri rakam par iskar main chhot milti he
 This also reduces the debt burden
 kagaji karrwiavedan ke saath pichhali pariksha kaa ank patr, daakhile kaa pramaan-patr, pan card, bank statement or chaatr yaa abhibhavak kaa iskar ritern or abhibhavak ke aay pramaan-patr kii jarurat padati he
 Depending on the amount of the loan, paperwork has to be done for the guarantor and the mortgagee
 sankshep main kahen to ajukeshan lone se bahut sahuuliyat ho jaati he

 sarkaar ne congress ke is ravaiye ko gaiyr jimmedaarana bataaya he

 Manish Tiwari of Congress, during the debate on the bill in Lok Sabha, had said that the government wants to change India into a 'police state' by amending laws like NIA and Aadhaar
 enie police agency jaisaa na banaaen
 Explain that after the terrorist attack on Mumbai, the then UPA government formed NIA by bringing a bill in 2008
 us vakt america kii fedral beuro of investigeshan( epabiai) kii tarj par is agency kaa gathan desh bhar main aatankwaadi karravaayiyon kii jaanch ke liye kiya gaya tha
 How will the bill introduced in the Lok Sabha by the Taktmodi government increase the strength of the NIA

 Prachi and Ranveer are out of jail after a lot of twists and turns
 lekin ab nish, riya ko khub blackmel kar rahaa he
 The previous episode of the serial 'kumkum Bhagya' showed that Nish threatens Riya that if she does not get out of jail, he will tell her everything now
 saath hi nish, riya ko paise ke liye blackmel bhi karata he
 The last episode of the serial 'kumkum Bhagya' shows that Riya gets very upset after listening to Nish and wants to tell Alia about it
 lekin purab, aalia ko apane saath doctor ke paas le jaataa he, jisase riya kaaphi tension main aa jaati he
 Riya thinks of stealing jewelry and money from the maid's room on the advice of her friends
 lekin jab wo daasi ke kamare main pahunchati he to use vahaan kuch nahin miltaa
 Zee tv's number one show 'kumkum Bhagya' will be shown today that Nish will reveal the truth of Riya to Vikram and Alia
 nish, abhi ko bataa degaa ki riya ne hi use praachi (mugdha Chapekar) ko drugs ke cese main fansaane ke liye kaha tha
 Hearing the truth of Riya, one will still be shocked
 ab dekhnaa hoga ki riya kii sachai jaanakar abhi kya karegaa? The Samajwadi Party (SP) has also jumped to cash in on the popularity of master blaster Sachin Tendulkar
 upi ke khel mantri naarad raay ne tendulkar ko sapa main shaamil hokar raajnneetik pari khilne kaa nyauta diya he
 Sports Minister Rai congratulated Sachin Tendulkar on being awarded the 'bharat Ratna', India's highest honor
 iske baad kaha ki sachin tendulkar agar bhavishya main siyaasi pari khilne utarate hai to unhen sapa main hi shaamil hona chahie
 He cautioned Sachin against BJP and Congress parties that both these parties believe in 'use and throw'
 naarad raay ne kaha ki unhen is baat kaa behad afsos he ki sachin tendulkar ne lambey samay se uttar pradesh main koi cricket match nahin khelaa
 Significantly, the Congress was made a member of the Rajya Sabha by Sachin Tendulkar
 iske baad se kaha jaataa rahaa he ki sachin tendulkar 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main congress ke liye prachaar kar sakate hai
 However, Sachin himself never showed interest in active politics
 congress netaa rajeev shukla bhi kai baar kah chuke hai ki sachin congress ke liye prachaar nahin karenge

 The senior BJP leader was cremated with full state honors at the crematorium at Lodhi Road
 sushamaa swaraj kii beti bansuri ne unke antim sanskaar ke reeti rivaaj puure kiye
 The personality of Sushma Swaraj can be gauged from the fact that at the time of her funeral, all the big leaders of BJP including PM Narendra Modi, Lal Krishna Advani, Home Minister Amit Shah, Rajnath Singh and Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla were present
 iske alaava upie adhyaksh sonia gandhi, congress ke varisht netaa gulam nabi aaazaad, anand sharma, rajasthan ke mukhyamantri ashok gahalot, ramdaas athavle or sharad yadav sahit vipaksh ke kai diggaj netaaon ne unhen antim vidaai di

 The US embassy in London has summoned a child of three months old for questioning
 isse bhi zyada chaunkaane vaali baat yah he ki is bachche par aatank failaane kaa aarope he
 The child had to see this day due to a minor mistake of his maternal grandfather
 dailemail kii khabar ke mutabik 62 varshiya paul canyon (paul Kenyon) apane puure parivaar ke saath orlando florida jane kii taiyaari kar rahe the
 He was accompanied by his wife Kathy (57), daughter Faya (27), son-in-law John Cairns (31), granddaughter Iva (3) and three-month-old Harvey
 paul canyon yatra se pehle puure parivaar ke liye yatra praadhikaran (ESTA) avrajan form bhar rahe the, tabhi unase ek maamuli galati ho gai
 There was a column in the form that whether you are a terrorist, or have ever been involved in terrorist activities or anything related to such things? Paul Kenyon filled the form of his three-month-old grandson and selected the option of 'yes' in this column
 yahi maamuli galati baccha sahit puure parivaar par bhar padaa
 After this mistake, the US Embassy called the child for questioning
 iske baad puure parivaar ko 10 kilometre kii yatra kar landan sthit america duutavas main pahunchnaa padaa
 However, after arriving here, Paul Kenyon admitted the mistake in filling the form
 duutavas ne bhi maan liya ki teen maheene kaa baccha aatanki gatividhiyon main nahin shaamil rah saktaa he
 The comments iske baad bhi duutavas ne bachche ke tikat ko manyata nahin di
 Asked Kenyon to buy the ticket again
 is tarah canyon kii galati ke chalate puure parivaar ko teen hajaar dollar kaa nuksaan uthaanaa padaa
 The lesson from this incident is that whenever you fill the form for travel or other work, then you should maintain concentration, otherwise you may have to take it
 is galati ke baad america duutavas ne bachche ko poochtacha ke liye bula liya
 After this, the whole family had to travel 10 kilometers to reach the American Embassy in London
 haalanki yahaan pahunchane ke baad paul canyon ne form bharne main hue galati ko sweekaar liya
 The embassy also admitted that a three-month-old baby cannot be involved in terrorist activities
 tippaniyan Even after this, the embassy did not recognize the child's ticket
 canyon ko dobaaraa se tikat kharidne ko kaha
 In this way, the whole family suffered a loss of three thousand dollars due to Kenyon's mistake
 is ghatana se sabak milti he ki aap jab kabhi yatra yaa anya kaamon ke liye form bharen to ekaagratha banaae rakhen, varanaa lene ke dene pad sakate hai
 Even after this, the embassy did not recognize the child's ticket

 sarkaar siyasat par amada he lekin sach kaa saamana karne se kataraa rahi he
 But Aaj Tak has reached the village where the leaders go only for votes
 biardi medical college main mache haahaakaar se koi do kilometre dur manbela gaanv main sannata pasra he
 Yogi Adityanath has visited there dozens of times
 piem modi ne bhi do baar daura kiya he, lekin rajanetaaon kii dastak ne bhi is gaanv ke bhagya ko nahin badla
 Manvela is that deathbed of eastern Uttar Pradesh where children yearn for every breath
 darasal manbela matlab bacchon kii maut kaa ek tila
 Under whose soil the bodies of innocent people are buried
 har maut ke saath ye tila or ooncha hota jaataa he or siyasat thodi or beraham-bermuvvat
 If the country changes due to the visits of the leaders, then note today that Manbella is the beneficiary of this concession
 varna darjanon baar yogi adityanath padhaare hai
 The Prime Minister has been interviewed twice
 maasoom golu ke liye na doctor mili or na hi dawaisbase pehle aapako ek aise bachche kii kahani bataate hai jo jinda to he lekin uski haalat dekhakar aapako maut kii yaad aegi
 a seven-year-old cannot play, nor go to school, nor study
 teen saal pehle dimagi bukhaar ke daure ne use bistar par aise pataka ki uski puri jindagi sahare kii mohataaj hoti chali gai, gorakhpur main uskaa ilaaj karne vaale na doctor mili or na hi dawaai
 Seven year old Golu is alive
 lekin agar ye ek bachche kii jindagi he to maut kisi kii bhi muraad ho sakati he
 Golu is that child of Manbella village from whom the emperor’s master has taken away the meaning of childhood
 golu ab baccha nahin he
 Stick to the bed is a wait
 ye kaisaa bachapan he
 Golu neither plays Gulli Danda with his brother Sumit nor reads poetry with his sister Priyanka, he loved both of them
 lekin kavita padhane vaala ek baccha ab kahani ban chukaa he
 The story of a country lost to encephalitis
 aap us mulk ko gorakhpur kehete hai or manbela us mare hue mulk kaa maathaa he
 Golu was not always like this
 ye bhi baaki bacchon kii tarah hi shaitan tha
 There was a rush for new toys
 lekin jab wo chaar saal kaa hua to shant padane laga
 Golu's world started shrinking and one day his life came to an end
 dimagi bukhaar ne is maasoom ko aise ronda ki golu ko dekh man ro padataa he
 Golu's condition is getting worse day by day
 gorakhpur ke aspataal haath khadey kar chuke hai
 The doctors have given the answer
 dawa asar na karte dekh gharavaale dua par aa gaye
 But what the elected government does not listen to its interim
 bhagwaan parivaar kii pukaar par baharaa ho gaya he
 Yogi Adityanath does not know how many times Manbella came
 lekin jab bijepi kii hukumat main nahin thi to har maut main unhen apane liye vot kaa khajaana najar aati hogi
 They used to say that when we come, we will make magic happen
 pradhanmantri tak ko lekar aae the
 But what happened once the ruler of the government became the mound of Manbella on Des
 tabatak dhyaan nahin gaya jabatak gorakhpur bacchon ke kabristaan main nahin badal gaya
 Manbella is the old address of this cemetery
 rinki kii kahanerinki bhi gorakhpur ke usee marbela gaanv main rahati he uski haalat dekhakar aap bataa nahin paaenge ki rinki jinda he yaa bachi hui he
 You will regret his life, the reason is the same
 dimagi bukhaar
 Government hospitals in Gorakhpur raised their treatment
 rinki ke garib maa-baap haar gaye
 a fever hit Rinki's brain and she became deranged
 taaliyon main utsukata or chehre par muskaan
 But Rinke cannot speak
 bataa sakati ki wo kya sochati he, wo skool ja paati
 i could read from mine, India from India
 mahaan
 But Rinki, who carried a flag like a butterfly in celebration of independence, was slammed in bed by the settlement of this country
 rinki uth nahin sakati
 Rinke cannot speak
 rinki soch nahin sakati
 Rinke does not feel hungry
 rinki ajeeb ho gai he
 Rinki did not receive treatment throughout Gorakhpur
 dimagi bukhaar ne uske dimag par aisi chot kii ki ek buland baccha bistar par aa gira
 Rinke became mentally deranged
 sharir ke hisse ko lakva maar gaya
 She cannot walk even on her own
 ab rinki kaa sangharsh taaliyon kii gadgadaahat tak simit he
 Get out in any street of Manbella village
 aapako koi rinki milegi
 Some golu will be found
 koi manisha kari tasviir milegi
 You will get a forced mother to dodge death for the life of your child, a grandmother trembling with horror
 sarkaro ke paakhand se parrast koi pita
 What our princes are left to raise the dead bodies of children
 mukhyamantri gandagi se bahut pareshaan najar aate hai, wo ye bhi maanate hai ki gandagi hi is beemaari kii jad he
 But Manbella has been a chronic address of his travels
 aate-jate thahar jate
 See how the people of Manbella live in this world of filth
 manbela ek gaanv he
 Purvanchal is a bouquet of such villages, from which children fall, smiling flowers, and the silence of some death is left behind

 The politics of Bihar has been taking a turn since the Lok Sabha elections
 party kii jabardast paraajay ke baad nitish kumaar ne mahadalit netaa jithan ram maanjhi ko mukhyamantri banavaakar parde ke peeche se shashan chalaane kii vyavastha kii
 But he could not completely separate from politics and, inspired by the feeling he had towards Modi, he shook hands with his arch rival Lalu Prasad Yadav
 yah vahi lalu yadav hai jinke shashan kaal ko koi yaad tak nahin karnaa chahta
 After defeating him, Nitish took the throne of Bihar by giving slogan of good governance to misrule and did a good job
 lekin ab vahi nitish bijepi se loha lene ke liye lalu se haath mila rahe hai or bihar kii lagaam sanyukt rup se unhen dene kii taiyaari main hai
 He is also accompanied by party president Sharad Yadav in this preparation
 sharad yadav desh ke un netaaon main hai jo dilli ke tughlaq road sthit apane ati shandaar bangale main sukun se din gujaarte hai
 From here he keeps pulling the reins of Bihar
 unase poocha jaae ki apni party jedy(you) ke vikaas main unka kya yogadan he? vah yahaan se baithkar apni suvidha se raajnneeti karte rahete hai
 Now he might want to revive Yadav rule again in Bihar and hence has joined hands with Lalu Yadav
 isse unki khud kii sthiti majboot ho jaaegi or unka prabhaav badhegaa
 However, the way Sharad Yadav is treating Jitan Ram Manjhi shows his mentality
 vah jaldi se jaldi unase chhutkaaraa paanaa chaahate hai taaki bihar main unka plan safal ho
 But the question is, what did Jitan Ram Manjhi do wrong that he should be removed from his post suddenly? He appeared as an honest and hard working chief minister
 unhen bihar kii janata ke har varg kaa sammaan or samarthan mila he to phir ek ek taanashaah kii tarah unhen hatane kaa hukum dene kaa adhikaar party adhyaksh ko to nahin he
 Manjhi becoming Chief Minister was the culmination of years of aspirations of the Dalits of Bihar, but now a conspiracy is being hatched to remove him
 bihar main lalu yadav ne pehle daliton ko khub sapane dikhaae or khud satta par ek dashak se zyada samay tak kabiz rahe
 Nitish Kumar did the same thing
 unhone maanjhi ko ek sochi samajhi ranneeti ke tahat mukhya mantri banaaya
 Now, when he feels that the Modi wave has subsided, he starts seeking the post of Chief Minister
 yahaan par unase yahi sawaal kiya ja saktaa he ki ab aisa kya ho gaya ki ve is pad kii ore takataki lagane lage? agar jedy(you) maanjhi ko hataati he to bahut durbhagyapurna hoga or isse party kii kirakiri to hogi hi nitish kumaar ke bare main bhi logon kii raay badalegi
 These days, the slogan of 'jai Shri Ram' is gaining a lot of headlines
 pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee ke 'jai shri ram' naare par gussa hone ke baad se hi tarah-tarah ke riection dekhne ko mili hai
 At the same time, BJP MP Ajay Bhatt has compared Mamta Banerjee to the bull
 bhatta kaa kahana he ki 'jai shri ram' kaa naaraa lagane par mamata sand kii tarah gussa ho jaati hai
 BJP MP from nainital-udhamsingh Nagar Lok Sabha constituency of Uttarakhand, Ajay Bhatt said, 'mamta gets angry when she sees a bull red cloth on her way, shouting' Jai Shri Ram '
 ' bhatta ne kaha, 'bengal main logon ne mamata didi ko 'jai shri ram' ke naare se hilaakar rakhaa he
 i do not know what happens to him by hearing Ram's name

 When i visited his page, there were several hundred comments on this video, but still could not know who uploaded it
