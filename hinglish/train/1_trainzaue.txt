 During the sixth edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL) in April this year, Chris Gayle blurred all boundaries of the regional clash
 lig ne badi mehnat se ye simaaen khadi kii thim
 On April 23, when Gayle scored 175 not out while playing against Pune Warriors, his team Bangalore captain Virat Kohli started tying the praises
 kuch virdohi tiimon ke khilaadi or prasanshak bhi is prashansa abhiyaan main aa jute
 Here he was in the process of becoming the protagonist of this edition of IPL, at the same time the analytical team of Team India was busy in the forefront of the problems in the near future
 ipiel ke baad do hafte ke bheetar england main champions trophy ke dauraan team india kaa saamana kris gail se hona tha or vah us maukey ke liye apane ko puri tarah se chaak-chauband karnaa chaahati thi
 This team of technical experts, called the brain of the Indian team, prepared a plan by running fingers on the laptop
 bhubaneshwar kumaar akele gendbaaj the jinhone ipiel main gail kii tufaani gendbaaji kii maar nahin jheli thi
 Team India's data scientists are now trying to find out through patterns and visual data modules why Gayle could not wash Bhuvaneshwar Kumar? The result came out that Gayle had difficulty hitting the bowlers with a speed of more than 140 kmph
 120 se 130 or 130 se 140 ke bich kii raftaar vaale gendbaajon kii dhunaai ve zyada aasaani se kar pate hai
 He also saw that the balls that came out swinging at the beginning of the innings used to tease Gayle
 11 june ko ovel main donon tiimon kaa aamanaa-saamana hone par gail 18 gendon main 21 ran banaakar out ho gaye
 Bhuvneshwar caught him in the slip on the ball going away

 In plain language, this program tells the team how they should face each bowler
 iske alaava yah is baat kaa bhi anumaan laga detaa he ki match ke baaki hisse main virdohi kaise khilne vaale hai
 For example, these experts found that Pakistani off-spinner Saeed Ajmal puts Shatin second in almost every over and if there is no boundary in the first five balls then the last ball will surely go out
 unhone yah bhi pataa lagaaya ki srilanka ke tej gendbaaj lasit malinga har over main teen phul gend jarur daalate hai

 We ask the team which option she will choose

 This is done with the help of apps sent through a very vigilant gateway

 According to Ramakrishnan, some players want to try it on the net before agreeing to us and some players discuss our suggestions with their personal coaches

 According to the source, 'modi also asked the mps to inform the public about the one-year achievements of the government in their respective constituencies
 '- input IANS Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to the Rajya Sabha today in view of the demand for three consecutive days from the opposition, but despite this, the debate on the issue of conversion could not be started
 vajah yah he ki vipaksh sarkaar se aashwaasan chahta he ki bahes ke ant main jawaab pradhanmantri kii taraf se aana chahie
 The opposition is emphasizing for this by citing the parliamentary tradition that whenever a serious matter arises in the country, the Prime Minister speaks on it in Parliament
 lekin duusari taraf sarkaar or rajyasabha ke chairman kii taraf se sansadeey niyamon kaa hawala dekar kaha ja rahaa he ki bahes ke liye kisi tarah kii purv shart nahin rakhi ja sakati
 Parliamentary Affairs Minister Venkaiah Naidu made it clear that the Home Minister would reply at the end of the debate, but the opposition did not approve of it
 to samajhane kii koshish karte hai ki bahes kii maang maan liye jane ke baad vipaksh akhir bahes shuru karne kii bajaae pradhanmantri se jawaab par kyon ada he or pradhanmantri kii taraf se is tarah kaa bharosa die jane se kyon bachaa ja rahaa he
 The statements of BJP mps like Yogi Adityanath have come on the issue of conversion, the opposition has got a chance to surround the government
 vah chahta he ki pradhanmantri is par bolkar apni sthiti saaf karen
 Two conditions are formed - either he will speak or not
 bolenge to dharmantaran ke mudde par yogi adityanath ke bayaan kaa bachaav nahin kar sakate
 They will have to speak out against such statements or efforts in one way or the other
 kuch usee tarj par jaise unhone andruni taur par apni party ke saansadon ko bhashaa or bayaan par sanyam rakhane kii salaah di he
 Through the party forum, he can give such advice, but if he speaks in the house, the wrong message will go to the party and the union
 mana ja rahaa he ki dharmantaran ke kaarykram chalaane ke peeche sidhe-sidhe sangh he, or usee kii shah par kuch saansad khule taur par ise bolne karne kii himmat kar rahe hai
 Regardless of the way you communicate with mps within the party, he would not like to be seen going against any of his mps under pressure from the opposition
 vipaksh puch rahaa he ki agar vah dharmantaran par saansadon kii bayaanbazi se naakush hai to karrwai kyon nahin kar rahe
 If spoken, these questions will also have to be answered
 agar nahin denge to vipaksh or gherne kii koshish karegaa
 
 
 And if the MP had to part with the statement of Yogi, the opposition would present it as his victory
 yani 'aage kuan, peeche khai' kii sthiti he
 The Prime Minister was not coming to the Rajya Sabha after catching up with the issue
 sansadeey kaarymantri pehle bhi bayaan de chuke hai ki sarkaar ke paas sakasham mantri hai, jo bahes kaa jawaab denge
 The government also did not want to let go of the message that it is not accepting the opposition's condition of the Prime Minister being present and running away from the debate, so on Thursday, the Prime Minister came to Rajya Sabha and tried to show his seriousness on this issue
 
 vipaksh itane se maanane ko taiyaar nahin
 He wants an assurance of reply from the PM
 aisa bharosa liye bagaiyr bahes karne se vipaksh ko kuch hasil nahin hoga
 He is getting a lot of opportunity to show that PM is avoiding speaking on a serious issue like conversion
 dharmantaran kaa mudda kanoon-vyavastha se bhi judaa he, isliye sarkaar jawaab grahamantri kii taraf se die jane kii baat kar rahi he
 But will Rajnath Singh, who is closely related to the Sangh, speak against any program of the Sangh
 
 
 ? bolenge to sochie ki sangh se unke aage ke sambandhon kii dasha-disha kya hogi
 And if he does not condone the efforts to convert, what will be his position as the Home Minister
 ek tir se do nishane
 
 
 The Parliamentary Affairs Minister said that the opposition is adamant in this way due to the strength of numbers
 jawaab seetaram yechuri kii taraf se aayaa ki sattapaksh bhi to sankhyabal kii vajah se hi loksabhaa main adta he
 Overall, the screw is stuck in the Rajya Sabha
 dilli-gajiyabad border ke kareeb vasundhara ilaake main dindahaade kii lut kii ek aisi ghatana saamne ai he jiske bare aapane kabhi suna nahin hoga
 You may have never heard that the robber himself is helping the robbers
 teen log johari kii ek dukaan main ghuste hai
 About ten minutes stay there
 phir bina ladaai-jhagada kiye yaa dhamkee die johari ko lut kar chale jate hai
 And the amazing thing is that the jeweler himself is also helping them in this loot
 jab use lute jane kaa ahsaas hota he, tab tak kaaphi der ho chuki hoti he
 The robbers escaped by robbing about one and a quarter million rupees and 35 thousand cash

 On Diwali i
e
 23 October, a person enters the shop at 1
47 pm
 dikhne main wo padhaa-likhaa or achche ghar kaa lag rahaa tha
 Then the shop owner was Varma and his servant in the shop
 aane vaala graahak sone ke pendent dikhaane ko kahat he
 But not even two minutes had passed when only a second person entered the shop
 wo pehle shaks kaa saathi tha
 Now both sit down together and start looking at the pendants
 magar unhen pendet pasand nahin aata
 They ask to show more heavy pendants
 baari pendent nahin tha lihaaja wo halke pendet ko hi ek taraf rakhane ko kah kar ab mangalsutra dikhaane ko kehete hai
 After this, they see the three mangalsutras and get them kept side by side
 phir baari-baari se wo tops, bunde, bali dikhaane ko kehete hai
 After this, they are kept separately as before
 is dauraan dukaan main ek or shaks ek bachche ke saath aata he
 He was probably an old jeweler's customer
 wo aate hi minute bhar rukta he or phir chalaa jaataa he
 Till then both the robbers remain seated by Sharafat
 ab tak sab kuch thik he
 The shopkeeper also appears conscious
 par tabhi ek teesraa shaks dukaan main daakhil hota he
 He was also their partner
 uske aane ke kuch der baad lutere ek anguthi kaa sies chota karne ke liye johari ke naukar ko dete hai
 And this excuse leads the servant away from the counter to the corner
 ab naukar ke saath luteron kaa ek saathi he jabaki baaki do johari ke paas baithe hai
 After this, both the robbers give the jeweler all the packets which had pendants, tops, bunde, bali and mangalsutra
 wo johari se saare jevar galle main rakhwa dete hai
 Having said that his sister will come and like it now
 iske baad wo hajaar kaa note nikaalte hai or johari ko ye kah kar dete hai ki wo ye sara jevar kharidenge
 Now both robbers ask the jeweler to open some notes

 dakshin bhartiya film industry main rajnikant ko bhagwaan kaa darja hasil he
 The madness about his films is not hidden from anyone but this madness is not only in the South Indian film industry but also in Bollywood
 rajnikant ke alaava bhi kai dakshin bhartiya superstars ne bollywood main apane aapako sthapit karne kii koshish kii lekin koi bhi sitara rajnikant ke str kii kamyaabi or lokapriyata hasil nahin kar sakaa
 However, with the film Saaho releasing on August 30, there may be a lot of stereotypes made and Bollywood can get a reliable South Indian star
 duusare shabdon main kahe to rajnikant ko takkar dene ke liye prabhas taiyaar ho sakate hai
 How much the makers are preparing for Prabhas's film Saaho, it is clear from the screens that this film gets
 reports ke anusaar, ye film saaho ko bharat main 10 hajaar screens par relies kiya ja rahaa he
 It is believed that due to being released on so many screens, this film can earn a bump of 75 crores on the first day
 iske alaava film ke mekars ne kai baar film kii relies taali taaki kisi duusari badi film se is film kii takkar naa ho

 official @officialsaahomoviea post shared byprabhas(@actorprabhas) onaug 5, 2019 at 3:46am pdtsaho ne screens shering ke maamle main bahubali 2 or rajnikant kii science fiction 2
 Has also broken a record of 0
 akshay kumaar or rajnikant kii 2
 0 Globally was released on 10,000 screens
 vahiin prabhas kii bahubali 2 ko duniyabar main 9000 screens mili thi
 The special thing is that Prabhas is trying to cash in on the popularity of South India as well as North India and the film is being released on more than 4500 screens in North India
 prabhas kii film bahubali or bahubali 2 ne hindi cinema ke itihaas main sabase zyada kamai karne kaa record banaaya he
 These films were well received in Hindi speaking areas and Prabhas managed to make a tremendous fan following in North India with the help of these films
 film saaho ko lekar bhi desh ke kai bhaag main kaaphi utsaah he
 In such a situation, if this film also managed to earn blockbuster, then Prabhas can compete with Rajinikanth with the help of his records

 Like perfectionists like Aamir Khan, he is focusing on only one film at a time

 unhone toornament ke duusare lambey final main romania kii symona halep par 6-4, 6-7 (5-7), 6-4 se jeet darj kii
 The final lasted three hours and two minutes, which was just two minutes behind the 1996 final between Steffi Graf and Arantja Sanchez
 yah 2001 ke baad teen set tak chalaa pehla mahila final bhi rahaa
 Seventh seeded Sharapova completed her career Grand Slam by winning her first Roland Garrow title in 2012 and was runner-up by losing to Serena Williams last year

 Sharapova has struggled in her serve this week and she made 12 double faults in the final
 sharapova ko haalanki yahaan tak pahunchane main 10 saal lage, unhone apana pehla grandslam 2004 main vimbledon main jeeta tha
 With this win, she reached number two in the all-time prize money, with American player Serena Williams ahead of her

 ' unhone kaha, 'mujhe bharosa nahin ho rahaa he ki 27 saal kii umr main maine kisi anya grandslam se zyada french open jeet liye hai
 However, it is comforting for Halep that she will reach a career-best third ranking in the world rankings
 donon khilaadi final main bilkul alag tareeke se jeet darj karke pahunchi
 While fourth seed Halep did not lose a single set in their six matches, Sharapova, seeded seventh, struggled to return after trailing by one set in the last three games
 lekin, roosi khilaadi ko anbhavi hone kaa laabh mila, yah pichley 10 saal main unka naunva grandslam final he jabaki halep 22 varsh kii umr main apana pehla grandslam khel rahi thim

 There is still uncertainty about Trinamool's no-confidence motion, although Mamata has not avoided seeking the support of the Left parties in her efforts

 Danish Rizwan has resigned accusing state president Vrishan Patel of embezzlement of Rs 12 lakh from the party fund
 vahiin vrushan patel party ke pal-pal badalte rukh ke kaaran istipha dene par majaboor hue
 Party spokesman Danish Rizwan has made serious allegations against Vrishan Patel
 unhone kaha he ki garibon se chanda ekatrit kar jo party fund main jamaa kiya ja rahaa he usamen se vrushan patel ne 12 lakh rupee kaa gaban kar diya
 Rizwan said, 'we had joined the party to serve the poor, but the money of the poor is being looted here
 isliye party me rahane kaa koi matlab nahi he
 Soon after the resignation of the spokesperson, Vrishan Patel also submitted her resignation
 unka kahana he ki mahagathbandhan ke logon ko ekajute rahanaa chahie
 Mamta Banerjee is fighting like a lioness in Bengal
 us samay party ke rashtriya adhyaksh jeethanram maanjhi kaa kahana he ki mukhyamantri ko dharna nahin dena chahie
 This statement was not correct
 vrushan patel kaha ki samay-samay par party ke andar ek hi vishay par virodhabhasi bayaan party kii kamajori ko darshata he
 He said that the Congress rally held in Patna was described by Jitan Ram Manjhi as a super hit and the party spokesperson called it a super flop

 As soon as the modi-shah government at the Center goes, preparations will begin to go to Yogi's Math in UP
 bijepi waalon kaa haalat is samay khisiani billi khamba noche jaisi ho gai he
 At the rally, Mayawati said that Babasaheb had given legal rights to Dalits, but to take advantage of this, we have to take the key of power in the center-state
 mayawati ne kaha ki aaj bijepi jo taanaashaahee kar rahi he, uske liye bhi congress jimmedaar he
 If the Congress worked honestly, the BJP would never come to power
 mayawati ne kaha ki is baar namo vaale ja rahe hai, hathi vaale aa rahe hai
 He said that the Congress remained in power for a long time, but did nothing for the poor
 unhone kaha ki bijepi bhi is baar centre kii satta se baahar ja rahi he, inaki koi jumalebaji nahin chalegi
 BJP people are only guarding Dhannaseths, while the farmers of the country are upset
 bijepi ke raaj main musalamaanon or anya alpsankhyakon kii haalat badtar hui he
 Today, the borders of the country are not secure, but the BJP is also engaged in capitalizing on the security of the nation
 mayawati ne kaha ki ye log garibon ko paise dene kii baat kar rahe hai, lekin agar hamaari sarkaar centre main banati he to ham sarkari naukari dene kaa kaam karenge
 He said to vote unitedly in the interest of the country
 abhi tak gathbandhan ke paksh main hi lahar chal rahi he, ab sirf antar ko badhaane par hamaara focus he

 He sneaks into the bill to remove it where this dangerous crab is hidden

 My wrist was crushed
 
 
 lekin meraa andaja tha ki vah jitani baar aisi harakat karegaa meri pakad main aata jayega

 tippaniyan Gujarat has played an important role in Narendra Modi's journey from CM to becoming the Prime Minister of the country
 narendra modi ke siyaasi oobhaar main hindutv ke formule ko sabase bada kaaran mana jaataa he to saath hi siyasat main ise bijepi kaa safal prayog bhi kaha gaya
 In 2002, Modi's Hindutva card made his mark in Gujarat and came to power and held power continuously for more than a decade
 2014 main isi prayog ko aage badhaate hue modi rashtriya raajnneeti main aae or phir bijepi ko aitihaasik jeet dilaai
 Now Rahul Gandhi is also trying to establish his political identity from Gujarat
 modi kii is jeet kaa shrey kahin naa kahin hindutv kii raajnneeti ko diya jaataa he or gujarat ko isaki prayogshaala ke taur par dekha gaya
 Today Gujarat seems to be at such a turn again
 jahaan centre main hai congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi
 Rahul is going to take charge of the Congress in the coming days and before he is crowned, he is working to make Gujarat his political laboratory
 rahul gandhi gujarat kii dharti par lagaataar siyaasi prayog karte dikh rahe hai
 While Rahul is trying to cut Modi's Hindutva politics on one hand, there is also a litmus test of political issues being taken from national politics
 rahul kaa muslim tushtikaran se taubagujrat se rahul gandhi bijepi dwaara congress party par lagaae gaye 'hindu virdohi' or 'alpsankhyakon ke tushtikaran' jaise aaropon ke jawaab dene kii koshish kar rahe hai
 In fact, one of the major reasons for the defeat of the Congress in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections was that the Antony Committee considered anti-hindu image
 rahul ne gujarat yatra ke jariye congress kii hindu virdohi chhavi ko todane kii kavayad kii he
 Looking at Rahul in Gujarat, it seems that he has abandoned appeasement
 muslim bahul ilaakon main honi vaali congress kii reliyon main rahul ke saath sant mahant manch par najar aate hai
 They do not stop and do not stop at any mosque falling in the path of Rahul's convoy
 itnaa hi nahin rahul ne gujarat main abhi tak ke apni chaaron yatraaon ke dauraan muslimon ke mudde par bolne se bachate najar aae
 On the path of soft Hindutva, the BJP seized power from the Congress hands through the Hindutva card nearly twenty years ago
 iske baad congress aaj tak gujarat main waapas satta main nahin aa saki
 Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi is in the process of defeating BJP with the weapon of bjp's Hindutva politics
 gujarat main rahul gandhi ne soft hindutv kii raah ko apanaaya he
 Rahul started the Navsarjan Yatra with worship at the Dwarkadhish temple in Saurashtra
 rahul gale main bhagava fatka daale or maathe par tilak lagaae najar aate hai
 Rahul visited all the major temples of Gujarat
 rahul pahari par sthit devi maa chamunda ke darshanon ke liye bina ruke hi 15 minute main ek hajaar seedhiyaan chadh gaye the
 Rahul's Twitter account is replete with photos of him visiting temples
 rahul ke mandiron main maathaa techne se bijepi baichaiyn he or unke mandiron main jane par bhi sawaal uthaa rahi he
 Rahul says in response, he is a devotee of Shiva
 mandal se kamandal kii katgujarat main rahul gandhi ne modi ke us trump card kii kaat khoji jisane 2014 ke chunaavon main congress ko kamobesh haashie par laakar khadaa kar diya
 That is, the answer of the Hindu card is from the ethnic card
 rahul mandal se kamandal kii kaat ko utre hai
 The most difficult thing for BJP is that it does not like caste politics
 bihar kaa vidhansabha chunaav iskaa udaahaaran he
 This is the reason why Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi has played the ethnic card to win the political battle of Gujarat on the lines of Bihar
 1985 main madhavsingh solanki ne jaateey kaa sameekaran aisa banaaya jiske jariye congress ko jo jeet dilaayi thi wo kisi bhi party ke liye gujarat main ab tak kii sabase badi jeet thi
 Rahul Gandhi has used Patidar, OBC, and Dalit and tribal votes in Gujarat to wrest power from BJP in Gujarat
 in teenon samaaj ke maton ko dekhen to kareeb 70 fisadi se upar kii hissedari he
 Rahul has embraced the Trimurti Alpesh, Jignesh and Hardik from the caste movement in Gujarat
 congress ke jaateey card se bijepi main bechaini badi he
 Narendra Modi had to say in Gujarat that do not fall under the pretext of casteism, caste issues will hamper the development of the country
 gujarat vidhansabha chunaav ke siyaasi ranbhumi ko rahul ne apni siyaasi prayogshaala banaaya he
 In such a situation, if Rahul achieves the success of the battle of Gujarat with his political formula, then he will fight against the BJP across the country with the same formula

 During the hearing in the Supreme Court, the counsel for the Election Commission said that the Congress has challenged the decision of the Commission to postpone the by-election in the Karnataka High Court
 ayog hai court main chal rahe is maamle par roak lagane kii ijaajat chahta he
 Expressing displeasure over this attitude of the Congress, the Supreme Court asked that when we are hearing here in the Supreme Court, what was the need for you to go to the High Court? The Supreme Court has given permission to the Election Commission that it can file an application to stop the ongoing hearing in the High Court

 6 lakh rupee ho jaaegi, jisamen adhisuchana ke tahat tay raashi par 20 pratishat (60,000 rupee) kaa tadarth laabh bhi shaamil hoga

 People have seen Mahesh Bhatt in many roles including filmmaker, director, screenwriter, social worker, but Bhatt says that apart from all these roles, he has a form which does not blindly accept the definitions of society
 
 20 sitambar 1949 ko mumbai main janme bhatta kehete hai, samaaj main kuch paribhaashaon ko shaashvat maan liya gaya he or jo is kasuti par khara nahin utarataa, use nazaij kah diya jaataa he
 My father was a Brahmin and mother a Muslim
 donon samaaj kii, parivaar kii paribhaasha ke tahat feet nahin baithe, isliye mujhe ek nazaij aulad bhi kaha gaya
 However, Bhatt believes that the same maneuvers of legitimate and illegitimate encouraged him to think beyond these definitions and started thinking beyond the confined realm of society
 arth, saransh, daddy, janam or jakhm jaisi filmon ke jariye samaaj main maujuud kai dharanaon par gaharaa aghat karnaa to duusari taraf wo lamhe, jananath or murder jaisi filmon ke jariye vakt ke saath badal rahe samaaj or rishton ko bhi utani hi gaharaai se pesh karne vaale bhatta kehete hai, maine badalte hue vakt kii nabj ko pahchaan kar uske saath chalane kii koshish kii he, taaki main peeche nahin chhot jaaun
 Having always kept the complexities of human relationships and the contradictions present in society at the center of his films, Bhatt says that what he saw, learned, understood and experienced during his life brought him to the screen regardless of criticism and consequences
 haalanki unka kahana he ki aaj darshakon kaa adhikansh hissaa gambhir filmon se ub mahasoos karata he or sirf manoranjan kii talash main cinemagharon tak jaataa he
 Bhatt says, the biggest irony of the Indian audience is that they want the truth on the screen but they also need a spanking of happy ending
 unhone kaha, darshakon kii isi badalati hui maang or bazaar main bane rahane ke liye main apni filmon main yah badlaav laayaa, haalanki jaden abhi bhi utani hi majboot hai or ek acchhee patakatha kii jarurat meri filmon se kabhi dur nahin hui
 One thing bothers Bhatt, who accepts the changing nature of Indian cinema, while it is fine to accept change over time, but in today's Indian cinema, Hindustan is slowly ending
 haalanki unka maananaa he ki yuva peedi main shiddat, pyaas or urja kaa jabardast pravaah he, bas gaharaai kii kami hoti ja rahi he
 Mahesh Bhatt started his cinematic career with the documentary Sakat and gained recognition through his 1982 film Artha

 vahiin, kisi bhi tarah ke alcohol se bani sharaab pinaa haraam he kyonki sharaab pine kaa ekmaatr uddeshy nasha karnaa he
 Another person from the US questioned that while cooking food from alcohol, alcohol flies at a certain temperature
 aisi sthiti main nasha khatm ho jane par us khaane ko halaal yaa haraam main se kis shrenee main rakhaa jayega
 On this question, Darul Uloom said that such a food would also be considered as haraam because alcohol would have been found in that food

 (input bhashaa se) In the third ODI between Australia and New Zealand in Melbourne on Friday, an interesting incident of David Warner's great batting remained without headlines
 australia ne toss jitkar match main pehle ballebaaji kaa faisla kiya tha
 During the Australian innings, when wicketkeeper batsman Matthew Wade was at the crease, Kiwi fast bowler Trent Boult got the ball on his wicket, but the umpire gave the decision in favor of the batsman i
e
 weed not out
 tippaniyan This is the case of the 44th over of the Australian innings, at that time Wade was playing 10 runs
 bolt kii ore se phenk gaye over kii paanchavin gend par vade ne shot lagane kii koshish kii, lekin gend ne balle kaa bahari kinaaraa liya or vade ke pairon ke paas gir gai or baad main ludhakte hue wicket par ja lagi
 But the Australian batting was so good that they did not get out
 darasal, gend ke wicket par lagane ke baavjood wicket kii bels nahin giriin, iske kaaran ampaire ne australia ballebaaj ko note out qaraar diya
 The rule of cricket behind not allowing Wade out, in which any batsman can be given a bold only if the ball not only hits the wickets, but also falls down his bails
 vaise newjiland ke liye yah acha rahaa ki is alag tarah ke 'jeevandaan' ke baavjood vade zyada der wicket par nahin tik sake or pari ke 46wein over main spin gendbaaj michel centner ke shikaar ban gaye
 In the match, David Warner played a stormy innings of 156 off 128 balls
 australia team ne pehle ballebaaji karte hue 8 wicket par 264 ran banaae
 Australia later stacked the visiting team for 147 runs and not only won the match by 117 runs but also won the three-match series by a 3–0 margin
 yah vakya he australian pari ke 44wein over kaa, us samay vade 10 ran banaakar khel rahe the
 On the fifth ball of the over thrown from Bolt, Wade tried to make a shot, but the ball took the outside edge of the bat and fell near Wade's feet and later rolled to the wicket
 lekin australian ballebaaji kii kismat acchhee thi ki ve out nahin hue
 In fact, despite the ball being hit on the wicket, the wicket did not fall, due to which the umpire called the Australian batsman not out
 vade ko out na dene ke peeche cricket kaa vah niyam tha, jisamen kisi bhi ballebaaj ko bold tabhi diya ja saktaa he, jab ball na sirf viketon par lage, balki uski bels (gilliyaan) bhi neeche giren
 However, it was good for New Zealand that despite such a different 'life-giving', Wade could not stay on the wicket much longer and in the 46th over of the innings, spin bowler Mitchell Santner became the victim
 match main david warner ne 128 gendon par 156 ran kii tufaani pari kheli
 The Australian team, batting first, scored 264 for 8 wickets
 australia ne baad main mehmaan team ko 147 ran par hi dher karke na sirf match 117 ran se jeeta balki teen maichon kii siries 3-0 ke antar se apane naam kar lee

 centre sarkaar ne baba ramdev ke khilaaf kii gai karrwai ko jaij tehraate hue unke khilaaf gambhir aarope lagaae hai
 Union Minister Kapil Sibal, while addressing the media on Sunday morning, justified the action taken against Ramdev, saying that the yoghguru did not fulfill his promise to end the hunger strike despite an agreement with the regime
 maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantri kapil sibbal ne kaha, ' hamane unki sari maangen maan lee thim
 Despite Ramdev's confession, he did not fulfill his promise

 CPM leader Muhammad Salim in the House quoted the magazine as saying it was Rajnath Singh's statement, which caused a lot of furore

 com / nwyrhs0hz8 — Outlook Magazine (@outlookindia) November 30, 2015 It may be noted that the 'outlook' issue on 16 November 2015 quoted a statement by Home Minister Rajnath Singh, which was debated in the Lok Sabha
 reporter pranay sharma ne asahansheeltaa par apni cover story main likhaa, 'maujuuda vivaad ek ulajhaa hua masalaa he
 It has the seal of the first Hindu ruler in 800 years (union Home Minister Rajnath Singh's statement on Modi's victory)
 jabaki grih mantri rajnath singh ne somvaar ko sadan main safai dete hue kaha ki unhone kabhi aisa koi bayaan nahin diya
 CPM MP raised the issue CPM MP Muhammad Salim raised the issue accusing Home Minister Rajnath Singh of making extremely objectionable statements
 saleem ne kathith taur par rajnath kaa yah bayaan sadan main doharaaya
 This was about calling the PM a Hindu
 iske baad sadan main khub hangaamaa hua
 The Home Minister asked the MP when and where did he say so? On this, Salim showed a copy of the magazine 'outlook' of 16 November 2015, in which this statement was printed
 baad main saleem ke is bayaan ko sansadeey kaarywahi ke record se hataa diya gaya
 The house was also adjourned once due to the uproar
 grih mantri ne saleem se is bayaan ke liye maafee maangane ko bhi kaha, jisase unhone inkaar kar diya
 
 
 
 to phir khandan kyon nahindusri ore, vipaksh is baat par amada he ki jab rajnath singh ne bayaan hi nahin diya, to phir is ore unhone pehle khandan kyon nahin kiya
 Opposition parties contend that the explanation given by the Home Minister in this case should have been given to him immediately after the magazine hit the market on 16 November

 We can say that one-third of this understanding was correct, but two-third was wrong
 aaie, dekhte hai kaise
 For decades, in the context of Pakistan, many analysts have been relying on the redundant equation of three 'A' ie Allah, America and Army
 ham maanate rahe hai ki vahaan inamen se kisi ek kii ichha yaa dabaav ke bagaiyr patta tak nahin khadkata
 This prudence has to be questioned here
 meri badali hui samajhadaari yah kahati he ki pakistan ke jatil halaat ke liye allaah or america ko to bematlab doshi tehraaya jaataa he
 i am neither an atheist nor stupid enough to question the Almighty, but the truth is that neither religion nor America defines Pakistan's ideology or power structure
 yah sirf vahaan kii fouj karti he
 It is the Pakistani army that defines, preserves and enriches the national ideology
 main isiilie aaj kareeb chah dashak puraani samajhadaari ko tilanjali dekar kuch sarleekaran saamne rakhana chahta hum
 Looking at the events in the last few weeks, we find that: General Pervez Musharraf (being a reporter and also being in the realm of alternative diplomacy, i know a few generals myself and as many as i met, according to me The most general was the Pakistani general) claimed that his army had a spectacular victory in Kargil
 ve bole ki unhone “bharat ko gale se pakad liya tha
 "it is different that in the end he succumbed
 karachi ke kareeb ek bas main ismailiyon ko aise vakt main maar diya gaya jab fouj ek manyata praapt lokapriy party muttahida kaumi movement (emcuam) ko khatm karne ke kagaar par he, bhale usamen ek sashastr mafia kaa raaj he jo phiroti vasuulne or jaateey jangon ke liye kukhyat he (zyaadaatar pakhtunon ke saath)
 The MQM was targeted because according to the army, it was responsible for the violence and anarchy in Karachi
 iske alaava usamen ro ke agent bhi the
 This slaughter on this occasion brings into question the army's claims, but the army instead blamed RAW

 Seymour Hersh has made some revelations in the London Review of Books on the killing of Osama bin Laden
 unka daawa he ki is suniyojit tamaashe ko siie ne iesai / pakistani fouj kii mileebhagat se anjaam diya tha
 The message in this is that only two generals (ashfaq Parvez Kayani and Ahmed Shuja Pasha) were so powerful in a country with a nuclear weapon-rich population of 200 million, that they did not consider the government elected to take such a deal even in confidence
 
 harsh ke daavon ko america patrakaron ne bakawaas kahkar khaarij kar diya
 Some doubts were also raised elsewhere in the world, especially in India
 sirf ek mulk he jahaan is par fouran bharosa kar liya gaya
 There was speculation here on the news that who was the person sent from outside in ISI who sold Osama to CIA
 vah desh pakistan he
 Let us now try to connect these different points together
 pehali baat, chuni hui sarkaar ke lagaataar saat saal tak raaj karne ke baad yah baat sabit ho chuki he ki fouj ke paas ab aupchaarik takhtapalat karne kii kuwvat nahin bachi he
 It has also proved that the army no longer needs to do so
 kisi bhi haal main takat fouj ke paas hi rahani he
 In these seven years, instead of increasing the credibility of the elected government, its stature has decreased
 dekhie ki kaise fouj ne karachi ko apane shikanje main le liya or pakistani fouj ke pravaktaa major general aseem bajva ke twit kitne hethi bhare hai
 You can go back further for proof of this: Imran Khan's demand for interference with the General to remove Nawaz Sharif, advising all the leaders of the army to leave a mutual confrontation and the Head of the army to attend all the top political meetings, Where his gesture and seating order reveals who walks
 adhiktar pakistani ise sweekaar karte hai, kuch afsos bhi jataate hai
 Distrust of generals is widespread, which is why Hersh's story is quickly accepted in Pakistan
 phir bhi ve fouj ko is sabake liye jimmedaar tehraate hon, aisa sunanaa durlabh he
 This enables the military to concoct myths of stating the 1965 war as deadlocked and now turning a defeat (kargil) into victory, while turning the defeat (1971) into a story of the deceit of some inept generals
 It is done
 fouj par aapako sirf tabhi sawaal khadaa hota dikhegaa jab koi general satta main dasek saal bitaa chukaa ho (jiyaul haq or musharraf) yaa phir bharat ke saath jang main ulajh gaya ho (ayub khan or yahiya khan)
 Despite this, there is something in this institution that after a short time, she reinstates herself
 haal ke varshon main hamane aise do naatakeey pasapalat dekhe hai
 After Musharraf, the army had become infamous in 2008, but used the 26 / 11 attack to create a false fear of attack from India, to create an atmosphere of jet planes from cities and overnight military liberators
 However, Asif Ali Zardari's elected government became so weak that he asked the ISI chief to visit India

 More than 65 years have passed for Muhammad Ali Jinnah, but during this time very few heroes emerged for the Pakistani public in whose name they can name streets, cities or institutions

 In Pakistan, after 1947, all the heroes have been soldiers, after whom the streets and streets are named after them
 dilachasp he ki maine koi sadak yaa gali kisi general ke naam par nahin dekhi he or aisa shaayad isliye ki sabase makabool general bhi yaa to nirvaasan main chale gaye, badnaam ho gaye, haar gaye yaa maar die gaye
 Their misdeeds, however, did not allow the army to be stained
 peshawar ke skool par hamale ke baad phir se yahaan fouj kii lokapriyata charam par he
 The support received by the army on terrorists was almost complete (operation zarb-e-azb)
 shaayad hi kisi ne poocha ki aakhir fouj ne pakistani taliban ko panpane hi kyon diya
 i want to ask my Pakistani friends a tough question: Why is the army so honored when it lost half of your country (bangladesh), not even an extra Kashmir was allowed to get you in comparison to 1948, destroying your institutions Dia, made the country a school and exporter of bigotry, forced investment and capable people to go out and ruined the economy? Till thirty years ago, per capita income in Pakistan was 60–70 per cent higher than in India
 aaj yah 15 fisadi neeche he
 During this time, the army has been ruling with either a straight hand or a crooked finger, yet no one blames it
 main maanata hum ki pakistan ne assi ke dashak ke aarambh main hi apni aarthik sthiti bigaadani shuru kar di thi jab afgani jihad se baichaiyn jiya ko kattarpanthi aatank kaa ek aujaar bharat ke khilaaf haath laga tha
 Ayub, Yehia, Zia, Musharraf and now Kayani, none of them is very popular and unpopular
 phir bhi fouj hi iklauti sanstha he jise izzat bakshi jaati he
 This is the reason that the army has coined the ideology of Pakistan after Jinnah, institutionalizing it through textbooks and military myths
 bharat ko jawaab dene ke liye pakistan ne pachaas ke dashak main america kii khoj kii to assi ke dashak ke aarambh main “achche” afgani jihad kii kamyaabi se prerit hokar usne kattarta (allaah ke mukaable zyada upyukt shabd) kii khoj kii
 People dislike America in Pakistan
 yahi haal sashastr kattarpathiyon ke ek tabake kaa he
 The percentage of votes received by religious parties is not even in double digits
 isiilie main kahata hum, yahaan sirf ek 'e' kargar he

 pyaaj kii keemton main baari badhotaree se bigadaa rasoi kaa bajtbihar ke jahanabad ke ek gaanv ke log nahin khate hai pyaajpyaaj kii keemten betahasha badhane ke baad jahaan log saste pyaaj ke liye maaramaari kar rahe hai, vahiin bihar main ek aisa gaanv bhi he jahaan ke logon ko pyaaj mahangi hone se koi lenaa-dena nahin he, kyonki ve kabhi pyaaj khate hi nahin
 Due to the huge increase in the price of interest in other villages and cities of the state, people's kitchen budget has deteriorated
 patna ke khudara bazaaron main pyaaj kii keemat 80 rupee prati kilogram tak pahunch gai he, lekin is badi keemat kaa bihar ke jahanabad jile kii chiri panchayat ke ek gaanv main iskaa koi prabhaav nahin dekha ja rahaa he
 The people of Triloki Bigha village, about 30 km from the district headquarters of Jehanabad, are not troubled or surprised by the increased prices of onions, because no one in the entire village eats onions

 Onion and garlic are also not allowed in the entire village
 gaanv ke bujurg ramvilas kehete hai ki aisa nahin ki yahaan ke log pyaaj, lahasun kii keemton main baari vruddhi ke baad iskaa seven nahin kar rahe hai
 People here do not eat onion and garlic for years
 unhone kaha ki unke purvaj bhi pyaaj or lahasun nahin khate the or gaanv main aaj bhi yah parampara kaayam he
 According to IANS, the people of Triloki Bigha village of Chiri Panchayat of Hulaspur block, tell the reason of not eating onion and garlic, because of Thakurbadi (temple) in the village
 gaanv kii subarti devi kahati hai ki unke gaanv main ek thakur ji kaa mandir he, jis kaaran unke purakhon ne gaanv main pyaaj khaanaa pratibandhit kiya tha, jo aaj bhi jari he
 She says with the claim that 40-45 years ago someone tried to break this ban, but an ominous incident happened with that family, after which people do not even dare to eat onions
 chiri gram panchayat ke mukhiya sanjay kumaar bhi kehete hai ki is gaanv main varshon se yah parampara chal rahi he
 However, he also says that you can associate it with superstition, but today this ban has become a tradition for this village
 kumaar kehete hai ki is gaanv main adhikansh yadav jati ke log hai
 Villagers say that not only onion and garlic, meat and liquor are also banned in this village
 is gaanv main kai log to aise bhi hai, jinhen yah bhi nahin maaloom kii pyaaj kii keemat itani bad gai he

 The life of leaders in democracy is like an open book, but a foreign writer's book on the life of Congress President Sonia Gandhi has created a ruckus
 is kitaab kaa naam he el sari rojo, jiskaa hindi main matlab hota he-laal sari
 On some pages of this book, some such things have been written about Sonia Gandhi, on which the Congress leaders are angry red
 sonia gandhi par aadhaarit ye kitaab spanish main he jiskaa angreji main matlab hota he da red sari
 Now in this red sari, Spanish writer Javier Moro has written such things, due to which all the leaders of Congress are angry in red
 jevier moro kii ye kitaab 2008 main hi chap gai thi or ab ise da red sari ke naam se angreji main chhapakar bharat samet puri duniya main bechney kii taiyaari he
 Why is the controversy The Congress leaders are angry that Javier Moro has written some objectionable things about Sonia Gandhi in his book
 masalan-- sonia italy main basna chaahati thim- immergency lagu karne ke faisle main sonia kii razaamandi thi- rajeev gandhi kii antyeshti ke samay sonia kii maujuudagi par pandit ko etraz thacongress ke netaaon ne is kitaab ke aise hi tamaam anshon par aapatti jataai
 The Congress wanted Xavier Moro to remove these parts from the book and when Moro did not agree to do so, Congress spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi's lawyer son Anubhav Singhvi sent a legal notice to Javier Moro in November 2009
 jevier moro kii laal sari par congress ke tevar talkh hai
 Congress leaders want this book to be immediately withdrawn from the market and seeing the situation deteriorating, Javier Morrow is clarifying that he has written a novel, not a biography of Sonia
 jevier moro kii ye kitaab philhal italvi, french, dach, spanish or latin bhashaa main prakashit ho chuki he
 Xavier Morrow claims that two hundred and thirty thousand copies of his book have been sold in Spanish and Latin
 ab unki taiyaari is kitaab ko angreji main chhapane kii he or congress iske liye kisi bhi keemat par taiyaar nahin he
 Congress leaders say that they cannot tolerate fabricated talks about Sonia Gandhi's life under the pretext of the novel
 laal sari kyonlal sari
 
 
 The same sari worn by Jawaharlal Nehru in jail was worn by Sonia Gandhi when she became Rajiv Gandhi's bride, and the same red sari of Sonia was woven by Spanish writer Javier Moro, the title of his book, on which the Congress leader is on fire
 congress ko is baat se koi matlab nahin he ki jevier moro ne upanyaas likhaa he yaa jeevani
 She objected that such things have been written in The Red Sari about Sonia and the Gandhi family, which are far from the truth
 jevier moro ko bheje kanoonee notice main kitaab ke un hisson kaa zikr bhi he
 In the book, Xavier Morrow has written on the page number 163 of the book - In the corridor, Sonia told Rajiv that she had heard the conversation of Siddharth Shankar Ray and Secretary Dhawan (RK Dhawan, Secretary to Indira Gandhi) that they all of the country It has been decided to cut off the power of newspaper offices and keep the courts closed the next day
 kitaab main ye byora desh main immergency lagu hone ke sandarbh main he
 Congress leaders are surprised at how the conversation between Sonia and Rajiv in the Corridor came to be known to Javier Moro? Was Javier Morrow present at the time at the Corridor? Moro's book is printed on page number 8
 
 At the funeral of Rajiv Gandhi, Hindu priests refused to allow Sonia Gandhi to be present there
 jevier moro ne apni kitaab ke pej number 16 par likhaa he ki rajeev gandhi kii hatya ke baad sonia italy bhaag janaa chaahati thim
 According to the book, she suddenly started thinking about leaving India
 
 They felt that this country would swallow their children
 sonia kii maa ne kaha ki italy aa jaao or sonia gandhi ne kaha- main nahin jaanati
 Javier Morrow in his book also mentioned the pressure on Sonia to take command of the Congress after the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi
 kitaab main us vakt kii baatcheet kuch is dhang se likhi he
 
 - 'sonia ji, congress kaarysmiti ne aapako party adhyaksh chunaa he
 
 'un logon ne unhen (sonia ko) apane pati kii maut ke baad aansu sookhne tak kaa mauka nahin diya or netaaon ne unhen gher liya
 - i cannot accept this (speaker position)
 
 - But you are the only Gandhi
 bharat main gandhi hona koi maamuli baat nahin he
 - i know what you mean
 ye aisa naam he jo bahut jimmedaari dhota he, lekin saath hi laanat bhi
 Why is the Congress concerned? After the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi, Sonia Gandhi kept herself away from politics for about six and a half years
 
 
 tab tak unke bacchon rahul-priyanka kii raajnneeti vaali naa umr thi, naa tajurba
 By the end of 1997, Congress leaders started knocking at 10 Janpath
 sonia pehle anakani karti raheen lekin baad main raajnneeti ke akhaade main kud padi
 Sonia started a tight politics
 nateeja ye niklaa ki chah saal baad naa to atal bihari vaajapeyi kaa lachchhedaar bhaashan kaam aayaa, naa endie kaa india shining or feel good
 The key to power was tied in Sonia's pallu
 khud pradhanmantri naa banakar unhone wo masterstroke khelaa jiske saamne vipaksh chaaro khaane chitt gir gaya or congress pichley raaj kar rahi he
 Now, when a question was raised on the excuse of a book on its leader, the anger of the Congress rose above the heat of the season
 congress ke liye apni netaa ke bare main likhaa har wo shabd pachaa paanaa mushkil he, jo sonia yaa nehru gandhi parivaar kii image par chot pahunchaata ho lekin congress ke is raay se mukhya vipakshi party bijepi ittfa nahin rakhti
 The BJP feels that the Congress is hurting freedom of expression
 kya kahana he netaaon kabhajapa netaa ravishankar prasad kaa kahana he ki jevier moro kii kitaab ko shaayad hi zyada pahchaan mil paati, lekin congress ke joardaar virodh ne achaanak sonia par likhi kitaab red sari ko surkhiyon main laa diya
 The Congress made it a big issue
 ab aise main congress ke dhur virdohi or sansad main bijepi se kadamtal karne vaale jediu netaa sharad yadav ne bhi congress par chutki le lee
 JDU leader Sharad Yadav said that the English version of Javier Moro's book Red Sari is yet to come, but before that the politics of the book has started gaining color
 kya sochate hai jevier morokitab par bavaal machaa to isaki gunj madrid main rahane vaale kitaab ke lekhak jevier moro tak sunaayi padi
 In response, Moro also thrashed Congress
 congress netaa abhishek manu singhvi par moro ne aarope jad diya ki singhvi naahak unhen pareshaan kar rahe hai
 Moro clarified that he has neither insulted Sonia nor made any wrong statement about her
 apni safai main wo yahaan tak kah gayi ki unhone sonia kii koi aadhikarik jeevani to likhi nahin he, unhone to kahani main kalpana ke bhi kuch chhaunk lagaae hai
 But by doing the same thing, Moro seems to be stuck
 aakhir kisi kii shakhsiyat par fiction likhte hue wo us shaks kaa naam kaise le sakate hai
 Then Moro has written the entire story of Sonia in his book and then not only Sonia, but the names of other characters are exactly the same, how can Moro's book be called just a novel
 congress kii phikraprakash jha kii film main katrina kaa kirdaar ho yaa phir jevier moro kii kitaab
 
 da red sari, donon main ek baat samaan he or wo he sonia kii image ko lekar congress kii phikr
 Prakash Jha gave the same clarification about the film politics
 film main kirdaar kaalpanik he to moro apni kitaab ko jeevani kii bajaay upanyaas bataa rahe hai
 The Congress cleared the film by censoring it with censor scissors, but Congress leaders are not in a mood to give any relaxation to Javier Morrow's novel
 isaki vajah bhi badi saaf he
 He feels that if there is a mix of imagination in the true parts of the novel, then in the coming days it can also have political damage
 vaise bhi sonia gandhi kaalpanik afvaahon kii bhuktabhogi hai or isaki shuruyaat siyasat main kadam rakhane ke saath hi ho gai thi
 The opposition's biggest attack on Sonia was on the question that she was of foreign origin
 vipaksh ke kuch netaaon ne to yahaan tak aarope laga daalaa ki sonia kabhi bhi desh chhodkar ja sakati hai
 There was no basis for such allegations, yet the noise was so much that Sonia herself had to explain many times that she is the daughter-in-law of India

 Regarding the petition, BJP leader and lawyer Ajay Aggarwal has said that he has filed this petition in the Supreme Court keeping in mind the interest of the country as the CBI did not pursue the Bofors scam case when the court's decision was invalid
 iskaa kaaran us vakt ye bataaya gaya tha ki kanoon mantralay ne isaki ijaajat sibiai ko nahin di
 Aggarwal has alleged that under the scandal which at the time was a nexus between the accused and the CBI, the bank account of Italian businessman Ottavio Quattrocchi in London was deferred (reopened) by the deal which i was middleman
 isi silsile main us vakt adishnal solister general rahe general bi datta ne england kaa daura bhi kiya tha
 He has said that such a step was taken when the then UPA government and the CBI knew that the matter had also been taken up in the Supreme Court
 agarwal ne aarope lagaaya ki is ghotaale main divangat pradhanmantri rajeev gandhi, kwatrochi, vin chaddha, hindua bhai or sena ke varisht adhikariyon ke khilaaf shaamil hone ke pakke saboot the isliye sibiai kii madad se congress sarkaar ne 1986 se 2014 tak is maamle ko rafa-dfa karne kii koshish kii thi
 Aggarwal has requested the CBI director to provide all the documents related to this case to the investigating agency, which has met the Tis Hazari court
 unhone kaha he ki is maamle kii jaanch honi bahut jaruri he taaki phir se koi rashtriya suraksha se jude muddon par aisi harakat karne kii koshish bhi naa kar saken
 Agarwal contested the 2014 Lok Sabha elections against Sonia Gandhi on a BJP ticket from Rae Bareli
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki sibiai ne bichauliye kwatrochi ke bank acount ko phir se chaalu karvaa diya lekin metropolitian magistrate tak ko isaki jaankaree dena jaruri nahin samajha

 Aggarwal alleged that there was strong evidence against the late Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, Quattrocchi, Vin Chadha, Hindua Bhai and senior army officers involved in the scam, so the Congress government, with the help of the CBI, hatched the case from 1986 to 2014
 Tried to do it
 agarwal ne sibiai nideshak se is maamle se jude saare dastavej jaanch agency ko phir uplabdh karaane kaa aagrah kiya he jo tees hajaari court se mili hai
 He has said that it is very important to investigate this matter so that no one can try to do such an act again on issues related to national security
 agarwal 2014 main raibareli se bijepi ke tikat par sonia gandhi ke khilaaf loksabhaa chunaav lard chuke hai
 He alleged that the CBI revived the bank account of middleman Quattrocchi but did not think it necessary to inform even the Metropolitan Magistrate

 @ anthonygargiula @ moredena This is almost too much cuteness for me to handle! india today safigiri main chif guest ke taur par pahunchi aishwarya raay bachchan ne baapu ke vichaar 'swatchta bhakthi se badhkar he' se apni baat kii shuruyaat kii
 Aishwarya, bowing to Gandhiji on his birthday, said that 3 million trucks dump garbage every day in the world's second largest population
 swatantraaa ke 69 saal baad bharat ek pragatisheel raashtra he or dhire-dhire viksit raashtra banane kii disha main aage bad rahaa he
 This journey is very long and surely it will take a long time to complete this journey
 aishwarya ne aaj kelifestilpar sawaal khadaa karte hue kaha ki aaj logsoshal mediake jaal main is tarah fanse hue hai ki unhen saans lene kii bhi fursat nahin he
 People do not even talk to each other face to face
 aishwaryane do saal pehle modi ji dwaara shuru kiye gaye 'svachh bharat andolan' kii tarif karte hue kaha ki desh ko svachh rakhana hamaara kaam he
 We have to be devoted to it
 chote-chote kadam badhaakar hi ham aage bad sakate hai
 This country is our home and it is our responsibility to keep it clean
 ant main aishwarya ne india today group kaa dhanyavad karte hue sabhi puraskaar vijetaon ko badhai di
 Do you know what the officers of banks are doing this month? They are discussing the direction of the Finance Ministry on how India's economy can be sized at $ 5 trillion
 jab bajet ke aas-paas 5 trillian dollar kaa sapana bechaa jane laga to kisi ko pataa nahin hoga ki sarkaar ko pataa nahin he ki kaise hoga
 Therefore, it has asked the managers of the bank to think on Saturday and Sunday and give an idea to the government
 17 agast yani shanivaar ko bank ke branch str ke adhikari power point banaakar le gaye honge
 After this discussion will be held at the regional level and then at the national level
 tab jaakar khud aarthik sankat se guzar rahe hamaare sarkari bank ke manager bharat kii arthvyavastha kaa aakaar 5 trillian dollar banane kaa idia de sakenge
 There is no need to laugh at this process
 afsos kar sakate hai ki bank kii naukari kaa kya haal ho gaya he
 Bankers have been struggling for salary since 2017, but have not yet been successful
 badi hui selary haath nahin ai he
 News is published in the newspaper that 15 percent salary is going to increase
 isi dauraan ve sampradayik or andh rashtrawaad ke changul main anya logon kii tarah fanse bhi rahe
 All the blame of the bank's poor condition was put on them, while more than 70 percent of the loan outstanding is with the big corporate
 unase lone vasuulne or unhen lone dene ke tareekon par bankeron se charchaa kerani chahie thi, tab lagata ki vaaki sarkaar kuch idia chaahati he
 There are many types of economic advisors from the Ministry of Finance to the Prime Minister's Office
 unke idia main aisi kya kami he jisaki bharpai branch str ke manager ke idia se kii ja rahi he? is daur main moorkhon kii kami nahin he
 They will immediately come and say that it is good that everyone is being asked
 ho saktaa he ki banker bhi kush honge
 There was an honor for his service, but now this condition has happened and he is also responsible for this
 tivi ke neshnal silebus ne unhen bhi kisi kaam kaa nahin choda he
 It is therefore important that dock media channels should be run in every bank from morning itself so that they have an idea of how India's economy can be sized at $ 5 trillion
 selary na badhane se nae bankeron kii haalat karaab he
 Three years of salary has been done and salary is very less
 ve apni hataasha mujhe likhte rahete hai
 i ran a bank series for two months
 hamaare ek mitra se ek bank manager ne kaha tha ki chunaav ke baad raveesh kumaar kii shakl dekhenge ki modi ji ke jeetne par kaisaa lagata he
 i remained normal
 main modi ji ko haraane to nahin niklaa tha, lekin morrkhtaa ne gorakhpur kii us bank manager ko hi haraa diya
 It is the condition of their citizenship or job that an essay is being written in the branch
 aap sabhi sampradayik rashtrawaad ke changul main funs kar apni awaz ganvaa baithe hai
 Have lost moral strength
 yahi kaaran tha ki jo banker sangharsh karne nikle unhen bankeron ne hi akelaa kar diya
 Did not support them
 kya pataa ve is halaat se bahut kush hon ki unase idia maanga ja rahaa he
 i am writing all this on the basis of the whatsapp message sent to me by the bankers
 ek baar bank series par likhe saare lekh pard len
 The bankers proved the moral force i lacked
 ab koi tivi unhen nahin dikhayega
 Regardless of the pride of their job, but they will not get respect on those channels, seeing that they lost everything
 phir bhi main fasebuk pej par likhata rahoonga
 i will not do it on TV
 do maheenaa kaaphi hota he ek samasya par lagaataar baat karnaa
 There is a lot of uproar about the impact of social media, i also want to see if there is any change by writing here
 mukhyadhara ke media kii bharpai kisi duusare manch se nahin ho sakati he
 There will be no less to say that this whole exercise is correct, but laugh sometimes
 yah thik aisa he ki pradhanmantri chunane se pehle niabandh likhvaya ja rahaa he ki yadi main pradhanmantri hota
 The one who writes the best essay is going to be made the Prime Minister
 agar aapmen vivek bachaa he to aap dekh sakenge ki andh rashtrawaad ke daur main bainkon ke afasaron kii garima kitni kuchli ja rahi he
 It is an insult to ask them ideas
 phir bhi ve apane rishtedaaron ko bhi nahin bataa pate honge ki unki kya haalat ho gai he
 Recently some bankers committed suicide and some were killed
 magar banker ekajute hokar unhen hi insaaf na dilava saken
 How lonely this moral and intellectual collapse of bankers has made them
 bankeron se ummid he ki is fasebuk post ko share karen or soshal media kii takat kii theory ko sabit karen
 i have absolutely no hope from people of other social strata that they will express sympathy for this condition of bankers
 bankeron ke saath acha nahin ho rahaa he, lekin unki haalat se yah sabit hota he ki agar koi chaahe to bees lakh padhe-likhe logon kii aisi haalat kar saktaa he

 bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne palatwaar ke baad congress ne bijepi ke aaropon kaa jawaab diya
