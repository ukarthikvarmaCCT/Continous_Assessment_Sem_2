 Sharma said that only a fair investigation by the Supreme Court-monitored SIT will reveal the truth as agencies like CBI and ED cannot be trusted

He said that this issue would definitely be raised in the budget session of Parliament as it is directly related to the Prime Minister, who claims that he does not tolerate corruption at all

 "the player of Mithali's stature should get a spectacular farewell and it is likely to be against England," the official said
 ’ aisa sanket bhi mila he ki newjiland ke khilaaf sabhi maichon main mitali kaa chayan (antim 11 main) nahin hoga or team prabandhan ke ek varisht sadsy ne unhen is baat se avgat kara diya he
 It is understood that Mithali is understood by the team management and the Cricket Board will give him an opportunity to retire on a short format on his own terms
 adhikari ne kaha, ‘abhi yah tay nahin he ki vah england ke khilaaf puri siries main khelegi yaa purush team ke purv tej gendbaaj ashish nehra kii tarah siries ke pehle match ke baad sanyas lengi
 She is not confirmed due to slow strike-rate and weak defense in the T20s, due to which she did not make it to the semi-finals of the Women's T20 World Cup against England

 Union Minister Nitin Gadkari says that reservation is not a guarantee of employment as jobs are decreasing

 The jobs in the bank have been reduced due to IT

 Where are the jobs? Nitin Gadkari, pointing to reservation on economic grounds, said that there is a 'thinking' that wants policy makers to consider the poor of every community
 unhone kaha ki ek soch kahati he ki garib garib hota he, uski koi jati, panth yaa bhashaa nahin hoti
 Whatever be its religion, Muslim, Hindu or Maratha (caste), there is a faction in all communities that does not have clothes to wear, no food to eat

 bataa den ki vipaksh modi sarkaar or bijepi par aarakshan khatm karne kii koshish kaa aarope lagaataa rahaa hai
 At the same time, the BJP and the Prime Minister themselves have said that no one can touch reservation
 vipaksh bhram failaane kii koshish kar rahaa he
 After his statement, Gadkari also made the same point and tweeted that the government has no intention of reservation on economic grounds

 One of them is such a name, which may not be mentioned, but for the country's independence, this youngest boy was hanged

 Those who were hanged for the country for Indian independence at the age of just 18 years
 vah sabase kam umr ke ugr or yuva krantikari deshbhakt maane jate hai
 Let's know about Khudiram Bose
 
 This great revolutionary was martyred on August 11 in the year 1908
 18 saal kii umr main unhen faansee de di gai thi
 Khudiram was born on 3 December 1889 in a village called Bahuwaini in Midnapore district of West Bengal to Babu Traylokyanath Bose
 unki mata kaa naam lakshmipriya devi tha
 Child Khudiram felt such a desire to liberate the country that he left studies only after ninth grade and jumped into the liberation movement

 skool chhodane ke baad khudiram revolutionari party ke sadsy bane or vande maataram panfalet vitarit karne main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai
 In 1905, he also participated extensively in the movement against the partition of Bengal
 6 disambar 1907 ko bengal ke narayangarh railway stesan par kiye gaye bam visphot main bhi unka naam saamne aayaa
 After this, a cruel British officer was given the responsibility of killing Kingsford and in this he was joined by Prafull Chandra Chaki

 Tagore, the first Indian to win the Nobel, according to the National Anthem Media Report to 2 countries, the magistrate in Muzaffarpur Jail, who had ordered him to be hanged, later told that Khudiram Bose was fearlessly hanging like a lion

 Significantly, the Sanskrit department recently said that Aryans were native to India
 marxvaadi or pashchimi itihaaskaar aaryon ko baahar se aayaa bataate rahe hai
 The Sanskrit department had said that it would soon start a project to prove the Aryans were indigenous
 iske tahat ab vibhaag apni paathya pustakon kaa adhyayan karne kii taiyaari kar rahaa he
 The report will be prepared and submitted to Smriti Irani's Ministry of Human Resources and recommended changes

 Western and Marxist ideas dominate them
 sanskrit vibhaag ke adhyaksh ramesh bharadwaj ne kaha, 'to kyon na chaatro ko iskaa bhartiya sanskaran bhi muhaiyaa karaayaa jaae
 We will rely only on literal evidence and the findings of research conducted in the last 100 years

 Although Bhardwaj believes that his decision may take political color, but it should be seen from the academic point of view
 gauratlab he ki bijepi kaa matra-sanghathan rashtriya swayamsevak sanghathan bhi aaryon ko mulnivaasee maanata rahaa he or vaidic yug ke itihaas ke punaradhyayan kii maang karata rahaa he
 However, historian and former DU professor DN Jha describes the Sanskrit department's move as 'ridiculous'
 unke mutabik, sanskrit faikalti 'batra syndrome' (deenanath batra ke sandarbh main) kii shikaar he
 He said, 'my sympathies are with him

 The court asked, the question is whether the written copy which has been recovered from the deceased's house is written for the applicant (suraj) or is it just a part of his diary?

 Appearing unusually humble in saffron robes, Yogi promised to transform Uttar Pradesh into an ideal state "liberated from the prejudices, riots and anti-social activities of caste and religion"
 ve bole, ''main aap sabko nayaa uttar pradesh dekhne ke liye vahaan bulaauungaa
 "it seems that this transformation has been partially begun — Adityanath has turned on the path of development to become the messiah of development
 unki haal kii kuch ghoshnaaen haalanki utani hi chaunkaane vaali rahi hai jitna apratyaashit 18 march ko unhen desh ke sabase bade soobe kaa pramukh banane kaa bhaajapa kaa faisla tha
 Voices of apprehension also abounded
 gorakhnath math ke mahant ke shishy ke rup main adityanath ke 1998 main raajnneeti main pravesh ke vakt se hi muslim-virdohi bhaashanon kaa unka lanbaa itihaas rahaa he
 Once at a 2009 rally, he said, "when i speak, thousands of people listen
" jab main unhen kahata hum ki khadey ho jaao or hindu samskruti kii raksha karo, to ve meri baat maanate hai
 If i ask them for their blood, they will also give their blood
 
 
 jab tak main upi or bharat ko hindu raashtra na bana duun, main nahin rukne vaala hum
 "of the five private member bills he introduced in Parliament last year, one bill was to change the name of India to India in Article 1 of the Constitution
 unhone november 2015 main shahrukh khan ko nishane par liya tha jab unhone desh main ashishnutaa ke maahaul par chintaa jataai thi
 Yogi had said that there is no difference between the language of this actor and Hafiz Saeed
 unhone kaha tha, ''agar baari sankhya main log uski filmon kaa bahishkaar kar den to use bhi aam musalamaanon kii tarah sadakon par bhatakana pad jayega
 "the cabinet top ministers were also surprised by this choice of modi-shah for Chief Minister
 adityanath ne sabhi pratidwandviyon ko peeche chhod diya
 Among them were Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh, UP BJP President Keshav Prasad Maurya and Minister of State for Railways Manoj Sinha
 brahman jati ke dinesh sharma ke saath obisi chehre maury ko bhi up-mukhyamantri banaaya gaya he
 The opposition says that with Adityanath coming to the center of power, the state will return to the temple-mosque and polarized volatile days
 makapa kii netaa brunda karaat ne kaha ki upi aresas ke liye ''prayog kaa nayaa maidan" he
 He has asked, "(in the UP elections) the RSS has won
 lihaaja usne yah mukhyamantri chunaa he
 This person has a criminal record
 upi kii tamaam adaalaton main danga failaane ke alaava kuch or gambhir aparaadhon main inke upar mukademe chal rahe hai
 Then why is this jumla of ending criminalization being given? "salman Khurshid, the top Congress leader, tweeted," Stop the hypocrisy! Yogi Adityanath will sit on the chair on which Pantji, NDT (narayan Dutt Tiwari) and Bahugunaji Like people used to sit
 piem ne bhaajapa ke trol waalon ko bhi mushkil main daal diya he! ise samajha jaae
 "for many, Adityanath's swearing in of March 19 is like a deliberate plan
 ve maan rahe hai ki prachaar ke dauraan vikaas kaa vaada karke bhaajapa apane kattar hindutv ke agenda par laut gai he
 Sources reveal that Yogi's coronation was not fixed
 unke chayan kaa lenaa-dena unke hindutvvaadi rujhaan ke chalate utana nahin he balki iske peeche chunavi ganit or bhrashtachar-mukt sarkaar dene kaa bhaajapa kaa vaada he
 Party insiders say that if this does not happen, it does not take a week to announce the name
 uttar pradesh main baari jeet ke baavjood pradhanmantri narendra modi or bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah kii nigaah se ek pareshaan karne vaala tathy chuta nahin hoga
 That is, the total votes polled by the Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party were four per cent more than the votes polled by the BJP
 iskaa matlab yah banataa he ki upi kii in donon badi partiyon ne agar haath mila liya hota to ve bhaajapa kii vijay yatra ko roak sakati thim
 Modi and Shah believe that in 2019 the entire opposition will unite against them
 bahut sambhav he ki 2019 main rashtriya str par bihar jaisaa mahagathbandhan dekhne ko mili, jisane 2015 ke vidhansabha chunaav main bhaajapa ko haraa diya tha
 In UP, the BJP got the highest number of 71 seats in the Lok Sabha elections
 isiilie modi-shah ne jin ummidavaaron ko sangyaan manh liya, unke liye sabase bada paimaana 2019 main party kii jholii main upi ko jeet kar dena tha
 The names of Maurya, Sinha and Rajnath Singh were going on
 sabhi is kaam ke liye taiyaar the kyonki teenon ko bharosa tha ki jo prachand bahumat sarkaar ko sthir rakhane main kaam aayega
 Their names were however shortlisted for different reasons
 rajnath singh 65 saal ke ho chuke hai
 Apparently, his waning age came in the way
 desh ke sabase bade rajya kii jatil siyaasi hakeekat se kathorta ke saath jujhane main keshav maury naram jaan pade
 55-year-old Sinha was considered to be intelligent but his loose image came in the way
 bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah adityanath ke sabase mukhya pairokaar the
 The Prime Minister was initially avoiding Yogi's name for two reasons
 ek, yogi ke jahrile bhaashan modi kii nai bahultavaadi nayak vaali chhavi ke aade aa rahe the or duusare, yogi ne 2014 se pehle modi kaa kadaa virodh kiya tha kyonki unhen aisa laga tha ki hindutv ke mudde par modi naram pad gaye the
 This was the period when Adityanath was identified with Vishwa Hindu Parishad more than BJP
 pradhanmantri ne yogi ke naam par tabhi muhar lagaai, jab shah ne ek samjhauta par yogi ko raji kar liya ki ve na sirf ''viechpi style vaale hindutv" or jahrile bhaashanon se baj aaenge balki apane bhagava anuyaayiyon par bhi lagaam kasenge
 Their basic work, however, will be to end corruption and nepotism
 modi or shah ko lagata he ki yogi adityanath agar is rajya ko kushasan ke fande se khinchakar baahar laa sake, to desh ke sabase bade soobe se nikalne vaala siyaasi sandesh desh bhar main guunjega
 Yogi Adityanath's day starts at 3 am daily from his usual bedroom located in the huge Gorakhnath Math
 pujapath ke baad ve math parisar kii ore jate hai or iske baad goshaala main jaakar gaayon ko gud khilaate hai
 After having breakfast of fresh gram, pudding and fruits, they sit in their office from 9:30 to 11 am and listen to the complaints of the people
 sampatti vivaad se lekar paariwarik jhagadon tak ve sab kuch hal karne kii koshish karte hai
 Muslims also come to them with their problems
 unke kuch kareebi sahyogi musalmaan hai or math main chalane vaale 400 bistaron vaale dharmarth aspataal ke kaaphi marij bhi musalmaan hote hai
 About four dozen educational, health and other institutions in Gorakhpur and Maharajganj districts manage them with administrative skills
 van ranger anand singh bisht ke yahaan paidaa hue yogi urf ajay singh bisht kii dasvin tak kii shiksha paitruk gaanv panchur main hui, jiske baad ve kotdwar chale gaye
 He earned a bsc in Mathematics from a college in Rishikesh
 unke sachiv or college ke sahpaathee eches ravat bataate hai ki adityanath kaa rujhaan hameshaa se aadhyatm kii ore rahaa
 He says, "he is an ardent devotee of Hanuman and fasted every Tuesday
" "disambar 1992 main babari masjid vidhwans ke turant baad adityanath kaa sampark mahant avaidhyanath se hua, jo gorakhpur se bhaajapa ke saansad or gorakhnath math ke mahant the
 Initially, he kept coming to Delhi's MP residence to meet him, then started going to the monastery in Gorakhpur
 mahant ne unke bheetar maujuud aadhyatmik rujhaan ko pahachaanaa or apana shishy bana liya
 Adityanath also comes from the Nath sect of Sanatani Hindus, who do not recognize caste divisions
 ek kaaran yah bhi he jo unke chune jane ke paksh main gaya kyonki is sampradaay kii maujuudagi desh bhar main he or bhaajapa ko ummid he ki adityanath rashtriya str par jatigat vibhaajanon se upar uthakar janata ko apil karenge, jaisaa ki aaj upi main he
 Modi and Shah predict that if Adityanath is partially successful as an administrator, then the number of his opponents within the BJP, including the opposition, will be modest
 party unase ummid karti he ki ve kanoon-vyavastha ke morche par nattejey dikhaaen or uttar pradesh sarkaar kii chhavi aisi bana den, jo nyaay detii ho, kisi par ehsaan na karti ho
 On the law and order front, one of the basis of expectations from them is that it was only after the rise of Dabangg Adityanath that the forest rule of gangsters like Harishankar Tiwari and Virendra Shahi was over in Gorakhpur
 shah kii nigaah main adityanath tab chadhe jab notebandi se pehle bhaajapa ke ek chunavi surveykshan main party ko 250 se zyada siten aati dikhi thim
 If it had fewer seats, the top BJP leaders would have opposed his name himself for different reasons, whether due to Yogi's rude behavior, anti-muslim speeches or fear that in the coming years Yogis emerge at the national level and do not take their place
 ek or vajah yah ho sakati thi ki bhai-bhatijawad kii samskruti se yogi kaa itnaa ghor virodh he ki netaa apane logon ke liye unase kaam nahin karvaa pate
 After the demonetisation, when the party's internal survey revealed 306 seats, Adityanath had emerged as a strong contender for the post of Chief Minister
 shah kaa maananaa tha ki upi kii prashasnic sadaandh ko durust karne ke liye yogi sabase upyukt shaks hai
 UP BJP spokesperson Chandramohan says, "yogiji is very strict against nepotism
" ve ehsaan karne main nahin, insaaf karne main yakeen rakhte hai
 Just like Yogiji's arrival, middlemen and brokers are trembling as the profit-greed culture was dealt a major blow in the coming of Modiji
 "bhaajapa alaakaman ke kareebi ek sutara bataate hai ki adityanath ko un do chizon ke chalate chunaa gaya he jinaki upi ko is vakt sabase zyada jarurat haih unki saaf chhavi or sarokaar ke vishyon par unka athak kaam
 BJP MP from Gonda Kirtivardhan Singh says, "they have to understand that the days of staunch Hindutva are over
" " ve kehete hai ki tabadale or bahaali ke liye mukhyamantri ko phone karwaane kaa to ab sawaal hi nahin uthta kyonki logon main ''yogiji ke svachh aabhamandal" kaa dar he, jo bhrasht nahin ho saktaa
 Modi's criticism of Adityanath turned into respect when Modi won 71 seats in UP in 2014 Lok Sabha elections without naming Ram or raising any emotional issue related to Hindutva
 yogi santusht ho gaye ki chunaav main bhagava jumalebaji ab utani kargar nahin rah gai he! isaki bajaae logon kii aakankshaon ko swar dena or hindutv ke aujaar ko pratidwandvi dalon dwaara muslim tushtikaran ke virodh tak simit kar diya janaa zyada phydemand he
 Yogi gained momentum as soon as he became Chief Minister
 pehali cabinet baithak main unhone apane mantriyon ko salaah di ki ve pratishodh yaa naayakatv kii raajnneeti se parhez karen
 He then handed over the party's manifesto to the top bureaucrats and asked them to make plans for realizing the promises made in it
 gujarat bhaajapa ke ek varisht netaa bharat pandya kehete hai, ''maine pehali baar dekha he ki koi mukhyamantri pehle din party kaa ghoshnaptr naukarshahon ko dekar unhen us par kaam karne ko kah rahaa he
 "senior Samajwadi Party leader Ram Gopal Yadav said that he would monitor his work for six months before giving a decision about Adityanath
 loksabhaa main apane vidaai bhaashan main adityanath ne sadan ko yaad dilaayaa ki kaise unhone gorakhpur ko gangvaar, dangon or gunda tex se mukt karaayaa tha
 When he is on the path of repeating these achievements in the whole of UP today, then it will surely be on his mind that he will be the one who will keep the most eye on the leader during the next few years
 bihar ke mujffarpur jile ke katra prakhand main baadh kaa pani fail jane ke kaaran diaria se beeti raat teen bacchon kii maut ho gayi
 Diarrheal disease has spread due to flood water in Dhanore Mushar Toli village in the block

 sunil ne sthiti ko niyantran main bataate hue kaha ki jin bacchon kaa ilaaj jari he ve khatre se baahar hai
 The condition of TDP president n Chandrababu Naidu, who is carrying out an indefinite hunger strike on the demand of justice for farmers, further worsened on Tuesday
 naidu kii bhukh hadtaal kaa aaj paanchvaan din he
 Somaraju, personal physician to Naidu's former Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, said after his examination at the Nizams Institute of Medical Sciences, "his condition has declined further as he is not taking any solid or liquid diet
 agar unki bhukh hadtaal aage bhi jari rahi to unki haalat or bighad sakati he
 'somaraju said,' Naidu has become very weak due to frequent fasting
 ’ chah chikitsakon kaa ek dal naidu kii haalat par lagaataar nigaraanee rakh rahaa he
 The team members said that their blood sugar levels also increased

 Many other people also tried to meet him, but the doctor was not going to anyone because Naidu has a cold

 When actress Nusrat Jahan decided to leave acting and step into the world of politics, many people found this decision a bit strange
 haalanki vartmaan main vah politics or antertenment industry donon kaa hi dhyaan samaan rup se apni ore khinch rahi he
 During a conversation with Modeler Rahul Kanwal at the India Today program Mind Rocks, Nusrat Jahan explained why he stepped into politics
 nusrat ne bataaya, "raajnneeti main hone se aap ek bade scale par kaam kar sakate ho
 You can raise your voice
 logon kii aawaaj ko duniya ke saamne laa sakate ho
 There are many problems of youth, which we youth leaders have a solution for
 ham unke muddon ko achche se samaj sakate hai or unka samaadhaan nikaal sakate hai
 "mimi Chakraborty's first Hindi song release, is such a reaction on social media that in the same program, she said that she likes to be called the representative of the public more than calling herself a leader
" unhen lagata he ki vah bas ek maamuli insaan hai jo logon kii baat sansad main or duniya ke saamne rakh rahi hai
 Nusrat said on the Kashmir issue that he felt that the entire country agreed with the removal of 370 and that no one had any problem with it, but it would have been better if there had been talks with the people there before it was removed
 acting ke raajnneeti main utar aane ke bare main nusrat ne kaha ki unhen lagata he ki ab vakt aa gaya he ki alag-alag kshetron ke log raajnneeti main juden
 He said, "politics is an area that everyone can join
 sadak par khadey apni bas kaa intjaar kar rahe shaks kaa bhi kisi cheez par apana opinian hota he
 Being a part of India, these things become more important
 irfan khan, sonaali bendre or rishi kapur jaise sitare philhal apni beemaari kaa ilaaj kara rahe hai

 aaj ke daur main jab footbal kii baat hoti he, to jin do khiladiyon ke naam sabase pehle jahan main aate hai, wo hai leonal mesi or christiano ronaldo
 There is a commonality between these two players that both play "forward" for their teams
 lekin in donon main koun behatar he ye bataa paanaa ek mushkil sawaal he or iskaa koi nishchit jawaab nahin ho saktaa, kyonki donon ke khilne kaa andaaj kuch alag he
 Now, based on the first match played by these two players in the current World Cup, it can be said that this time Portugal's striker Ronaldo has the upper hand on Argentina's Messi
 group di kaa pehla match argentina or aisland ke bich khelaa gaya jisamen mesi kaa pradarshan unki chhavi ke anuroop nahin rahaa or wo is match main apni chhap chhodane main kaamyaab nahin ho sake
 Let me tell you that in this match Messi made 11 attempts, out of which 3 were on target, but not a single one of them turned into a goal
 itnaa hi nahin mesi ne ek penlti bhi miss kar di, jisase unki team ko match main drow ke saath santosh karnaa padaa
 At the same time, in their first match of Group B, Portugal's team was competing against Spain which ended on par
 lekin kah sakate hai ki ronaldo kii hetric kii badaulat hi portugal kii team yah muqabla drow karvaa pai, kyonki spain kii team kaaphi acha khel rahi thi
 But Ronaldo not only scored his hat-trick after scoring an excellent goal in the last minutes of the match but also managed to avoid defeat to the team
 yah footbal world cap ke muqablon main unki pehali hetric he saath hi 33 varshiya ronaldo, ab vishwa cap main hetric lagane vaale sabase umradraj khilaadi bhi ban gaye hai
 Earlier, this record was named after Rob Rensenbrink of the Netherlands who scored a hat-trick against Iran in 1978 at the age of 30
 ronaldo or mesi donon ke liye hi ye chauthaa vishwa cap he

 PM Modi also responded with examples in the same way to children
 bacchon ne piem se sawaal kiya ki pariksha se pehle ham bahut taiyaari karte hai, lekin ain vakt par sab kuch bhul jate hai
 On this, PM Modi said that in such a time, the most important thing is to maintain confidence
 piem ne sachin tendulkar kaa zikr kiya
 The PM said that Sachin Tendulkar had said one thing very well
 sachin ne kaha ki main jis samay jo ball kheltaa hum, us samay sirf usee gend ke bare main sochataa hum
 i did not think about what was the first ball or how to play the next ball
 thik aise hi aap bachche bhi padhai ke vakt sirf padhai hi karen
 Don't think of anything else during that time
 ek chaatra ne sawaal kiya ki mere mata-pita meri tulana hameshaa duusare bacchon se karte hai, jisase main tanaav main rahati hum
 How to overcome it is sawaal kaa jawaab bhi piem ne ek udhaaharan ke saath samajhaayaa
 Giving the example of war science, he said that you always play in your field
 isse aap zyada behatar kar sakate hai

 unhone kaha ki bharat kaa baccha janmajaat netaa hota he
 Children know what work will be done
 piem ne mata-pita se bhi apil kii ki ve apane bacchon ko lekar soshal states na banaaen
 There is some strength in every child
 abhibhavak bhi use jaane-samajhen or use taraashen
 Life is not just numbers
 ek chaatra ne kaha ki pariksha ke dauraan duusari chijen dhyaan bantaati hai, jisase ham padhai par dhyaan kendrit nahin kar pate
 On this, PM Modi said that if you want to focus on something first, then learn to be de-focused first
 iske liye bachapan kii aadaton se jud jaaie
 It will help a lot

 piem ne bacchon se kaha ki main dinabhar itnaa kaam karata hum lekin raat main bistar par jate hi tees second main so jaataa hum
 Yoga posture is quite helpful in this
 philhal aapako jo asana acha lagata he, usee ko karen
 With that, you will have energy in you and help to concentrate
 ek sawaal ke jawaab main unhone kaha ki hamaare samaaj main shikshakon ko pehle parivaar ke sadasyon kii tarah mana jaataa tha
 Today we need to rekindle this feeling

 saath hi wo kariyar ko lekar sawaal puche hai

 unhone kaha, "hamane bebasii main desh choda or hamen lambey samay tak desh waapas aane kii ijaajat nahin di gai

 An elephant named Raju, who has been bruised and hurt in chains, has been forced to suffer in the chilling cold under the open sky for the past 6 months, but he has no one to listen
 raju bejubaan he, iske baavjood usne elahabaad hoicourt kaa darwaja khatkhataya
 But he also got the place of release from the court frame, date after date

 Despite this, he has been imprisoned by putting thick chains on his legs
 raju is samay sarkaar dwaara banaai gai ek asthaayee jail main hiraasat main he
 As winter is settling down, Raju's troubles are also increasing
 jaise-jaise raju kii sehat gir rahi he, raju kaa maalik shahid bhi pareshaan he
 Raju was taken into custody on July 29, 2013 by Allahabad Forest Department officials after he was beaten to death by hunger and thirst by crushing his Mahavat Mohan
 gajraj ko hiraasat main lene ke baad jab van vibhaag ke adhikariyon ko vanya jeev praani adhinium ke tahat koi dandatmak aparaadh or dhara nahin mili, to unhone raju ko aise kanoonee pachade main fansaa diya, jiske baad vah 6 maheene biit jane ke baad bhi azaad nahin ho paaya
 After taking Raju into custody, authorities imprisoned him in a temporary prison under the sky under loneliness
 raju ko yah kahkar adhikariyon ne reeha karne se inkaar kar diya ki raju par kiskaa malikana haq he, yah abhi saafe nahin he
 According to Mevalal, the brother of Mahavat who was killed by Raju, Mahavat's mistake was that he was not giving food to the elephant in time
 teen-chaar din se hathi ko koi roti nahin de rahaa tha
 Angered by that, the elephant suppressed him and the Mahavat ended
 van vibhaag ke adhikari kees yadav kaa kahana he ki 29 july kii raat main yah hathi bina license ke pakadaa gaya tha or isane apane mahavat ko maar diya tha
 Since then it has been kept in the custody of the Forest Department

 Regarding the condition of the CBI, the Supreme Court remarked with concern that the investigating agency (CBI) has become like a caged parrot, which has many owners and speaks the language of its owners
 supreme court ne sarkaar se bhi sawaal kiya ki kya vah sibiai ko sarkari shikanje se mukt karne ke liye kanoon banaaegi
 The court said that it is very important to ensure that there is no pressure on the CBI

 The court said that the CBI has to understand that it was an investigation report, not a progress report, to be shared with the government and its officials

 The Supreme Court pulled up the joint secretaries of the Ministry of Coal and the PMO for meeting the CBI officials and suggesting changes in the draft report
 court ne kaha ki sibiai kaa kaam sarkari adhikariyon se samvaad karnaa nahin, balki sachai saamne laane ke liye poochtacha karnaa he
 At the same time, Attorney General GE Vahanvati, while presenting his side of the court, said, "I met the CBI officers only at the behest of the law minister and as far as the draft status report is concerned, i neither asked for nor saw that report

 You are beautiful as you are and you must realize it
 tabhi aap khul kar ji paaengi

 You will start seeing yourself
 3
 Whether you are skinny or fat, it doesn't make any sense

 4
 Your happiness cannot be attractive to the skin

 kabhi apane dar kaa saamana karen
 Do something that scares you the most

 Lastly, but the most important thing is to always trust your beauty

 ab jaraa 2017 kii kalpana karen or ab thik aisa hi jiestn tex ritern ke maamle main ho rahaa he
 Since the GSTN window for the tax returns of July has been online, there has been a flurry of complaints in the newspapers
 kuch vyapaariyon kaa kahana he ki tex chukaa diya gaya he lekin jiestn kii raseeden kuch or hi bataati hai
 Some people have received receipts that contain many mistakes
 bahut se log 'sarwar kii deree' or 'seshan khatm ho jane' ke kaaran apana tex hi nahin bhar paae
 The protest was so great that the last date for filing the tax returns of July was increased by five days to 10 September
 lekin vah taarikh aae usase pehle hi 8 sitambar ko jiesti
 Gov
 ien krash kar gaya
 Now the last date has once again been extended to 10 October
 kuch logon kaa kahana he ki antim samay main ek saath bahut zyada logon ke tex ritern bharne ke kaaran aisa hua
 If this is true, the odd thing is: In late July, Sharad Raghavan of The Hindu wrote quoting Naveen Kumar, former GSTN chairman, "we studied the nature of taxpayers
" 
 
 (or) paaya ki 50 fisadi karadaata aakhri din tex ritern bharte hai or aakhri din bhi unamem bhi zyaadaatar tisare pahar 4 se 5 baje ke bich
 
 
 We kept this in mind when designing the system
 ''lagu karne main aisi samasya ho sakati he
 Reports suggest that important parts of the website including rate data and classification of goods, which should be 'coded' in the online form, are being 'improved'
 yahaan ek udhaaharan diya ja rahaa haih jis din vitt mantri arun jetali ne 10 aktubar kii nai antim taarikh kii ghoshnaa kii thi, usee din unhone tex code main kai badlaavon kii bhi ghoshnaa kii thiah renkot or rabar band jaise kai vastuon par tex kii daren kam kar di gai thim, kaaron ke kai shreniyon par chungi badha di gai thi or khaadi ko puri chhot de di gai thi
 After every, improvement, programming has to be done and companies like Infosys have to do it
 ye samasyaayein isliye bhi pareshaan karne vaali hai ki unhen pehle hi dekh liya gaya tha

 After all, aap's Captain Kejriwal did not talk, then agreed to play a political game with the Punjab Congress Captain's team
 apni patni ko pehle hi congress main shaamil kara diya
 That day Mrs
 Sidhu told the media that we are both one soul and one body, i have come to Congress, so how many days can the body stay away from the soul
 tay ho gaya ki siddhu bhi punjab congress ke captain amarinder ke saath hi siyaasi chakke chauke lagaayenge
 Batting for Congress from January 19 On January 19, Sidhu, along with Captain Amarinder, will bat for the Congress in Punjab by taking part in the Darbar Sahib in Amritsar
 party ke saath hi siddhu kii jwining main ahm bhoomika nibhaane vaale rahul ke ranneetikaar pike kii koshish he ki, amarinder or siddhu main ekta nazar aae

 congress main jwining birbal kii khichdi si ho gailekin uske baat kaaphi vaqt guzar gaya, siddhu kii congress main jwining birbal kii khichdi si ho gai
 All kinds of questions started floating in the political arena, when on January 11, suddenly Sidhu met Rahul Gandhi secretly and went to his house, once again it was confirmed that Sidhu will come to the Congress, then Lohri passed, Makar Sankranti too
 Gone, then the market of speculation started to heat up, when Sidhu, famous for the furore and laughter, met Rahul alone on Sunday morning alone and later the Congress took a photo He tweeted that Sidhu has now become a Congressman
 sab kuch bade sannaate main hua
 Sidhu, known for his dialogue delivery in the media, did not utter a word in the media
 haa, ek twit jarur kiya, jisamen punjab or punjabiyat kii baat karke bataa diya ki, bhavishya main siddhuvani kejariwal ko bahari bataakar barasane vaali he
 Why there was a delay in joining? Actually, according to sources, Sidhu first wanted to complete his commitments to the TV world, so it was delayed
 uske baad party ne unase 9 yaa 10 janvari ko party main shaamil hone kii baat kii to siddhu ne tara duba hone kaa hawala de diya
 After all, Sidhu was going to become a star in the Congress, so he was only following the stars' tricks
 lekin ulti khabaren media main naa aaen, isliye unki rahul kii mulaakaat kara di gai
 The condition that was placed before joining was now a new condition, he wanted to join Congress in front of Rahul Gandhi instead of Captain Amarinder and Asha Kumari, after all the question was political height, he should not show himself as younger than Captain Amarinder
 Want
 lekin congress kii mushkil ye thi ki rahul yaa sonia kisi netaa ko party jwine karaane party offis nahin aate, haa- jwining ke pehle unki mulaakaat jarur rahul yaa sonia se kara di jaati he
 In such a way, releasing pictures of the meeting with Rahul, taking the middle way
 party ne use hi siddhu kii jwanning qaraar de diya
 Now the next day, Sidhu will meet the media in the Congress headquarters, which was earlier scheduled for joining, then everyone is waiting for how the political batting of Sidhu in the new team will be in the new style
 vaise punjab kii siyaasi pich siddhu ke liye nai nahin he, lekin team, captain or bhoomika jarur badal gai he

 Rakhi Birla, who was an intern in Jain TV, quit journalism and joined the Aam Aadmi Party and dusted off the Congress leader
 party se judane waalon kii list main patrakaron kaa varchasv din ba din badhata hi ja rahaa he
 Another journalist was added to this list on Thursday
 varisht sampadak or tivi jagat ke jane maane chehre ashutosh bhi aam aadmi party ke saath jud gaye hai
 He announced that now he is leaving the profession of journalism and going into the field of politics
 aap party main shaamil hone profeshnal logon kii list main ashutosh kaa bhi naam shaamil ho gaya
 Prior to this, Air Deccan founder Captain Gopinath, banker and former chairman of Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) Meera Sanyal and famous dancer Mallika Sarabhai have also joined the party
 party main shaamil hone waalon main se kai aise madhyam vargeey parivaar ke hai, jo samay-samay par bhrasht netaaon or sadaandh maare rahe system ke khilaaf aawaaj uthaate rahe hai
 Parties like the Congress and the BJP have always been stuck in the path of free-spirited citizens going into politics
 congress main jahaan adhiktar 10 janpath main salaam thonkane waalon to vahiin bijepi main nagpur main baithe logon ko dandavat karne waalon kaa bhala hota he
 The contract for contesting elections is mostly won by the relatives of veteran leaders or those close to the ruling party
 loksabhaa chunaavon main behtareen pradarshan karne kaa khwab dekh rahi anubhavviheen aam aadmi party chaahati he ki uske saath ab aise log jude jo samooche raashtra main party kaa sahi massej logon tak pahunchaa saken
 The party's aspiration to dominate the whole country is passing on those who were buried under the existing bad political system
 manish sitaudiya, shajia ilmi or raakhi birla ke baad ashutosh us list main shaamil ho gaye hai, jinke upar party ko chamakaane or badhaane kii vishesh jimmedaari hogi
 Of these, Manish Sisodia is currently a senior minister in the Delhi government and is very close to Arvind Kejriwal
 sitaudiya ji news main produsar kii naukari chhodkar arvind kejariwal ke enjio parivartan ke saath jud gaye the
 Prior to joining the anti-corruption movement, Shazia Ilmi was the chief anchor of Star News
 sabase zyada joardaar raheen 26 varshiya raakhi birla, jinhone peedblyoody ministar rajkumaar chouhan ko chunavi ran main joardaar patkhni di
 And now she has become the Minister of Women and Child Development of Delhi Government
 bataur reporter raakhi anti karpshan beet dekhati thi, jo naukari chhodkar kejariwal ke andolan main kud padin
 For Ashutosh, it was Stockholm syndrome
 anti karpshan movement kii reporting inhone bade hi jaandaar tareeke se kii
 Like other editors, he not only focused on it from studios, but went to Ramlila Maidan and Jantar Mantar and reported sweating in the sun
 inhone logon tak party ke moolbhoot siddhanton ko bade hi behtareen tareeke se parosa or khud activist jarnlist kii tarah najar aae
 Ashutosh has also written the book 'anna: 13 Days Awakened India' on Anna Hazare's movement
 IBN7 jwine karne se pehle ashutosh ajtak ke saath kareeb 11 varshon tak jude rahe
 The journey started from the post of correspondent on TV Today to Executive Editor
 ashutosh tab chamake, jab basapa netaa kanshiram ne varsh, 1996 main un par thappad jadaa tha
 When Kanshi Ram was asking to go to an army of journalists outside his house, Ashutosh was adamant about taking his baits
 ashutosh ne aam aadmi party join karne kii khabar twitor ke jariye subah saarvajanik kii
 Ashutosh tweeted that '8 years ago i changed my path and now the same time has come again
 destni kaa ek or kol he
 i have to grow with it
 ye aitihaasik pal hai
 Social churn is going on
 is badlaav ko or majboot or khubasurat banane ke liye har kisi ko yogadan dena hoga
 'ashutosh is not yet relieved from IBN7, he is waiting for it
 releaving ke turant baad wo party join kar lenge
 Currently, Vinay Tiwari, managing editor of CNN IBN, will oversee the work of Ashutosh
 ashutosh party ke tikat se loksabhaa chunaav ladane ke bare me gambhirtha se vichaar kar rahe hai
 However, it is not yet clear where and against whom he will enter the electoral battle
 kejariwal chaahate hai ki ashutosh party ke bade faisle lene vaali team, jisamen yogendra yadav pramukh he, main rahen
 Ashutosh will be the firebrand spokesperson of the party
 patrakaron kaa raajnneeti main aana koi nai ghatana nahin he
 From MJ Akbar to Chandan Mitra, he has entered politics
 raajnneeti se waapas phul time patrakarita main aana vinaashkari he
 This is such a Lakshman Rekha, which can be crossed only once
 darshakon ke liye ashutosh kaa yah faisla kaaphi chaunkaane vaala he
 His decision is putting the mind of the audience that his favorite anchor was not biased at all
 haalanki yah acha rahaa ki ashutosh ne rajnatik jivan kii shuruyaat kar yah saaf kar diya ki wo kisi kaa cheharaa banakar patrakarita nahin kar rahe hai
 Journalism values can be established only by those who ask the same questions to all parties without being afraid, without taking sides
 aam aadmi party kii lokapriyata is samay har ore kaaphi teji se bad rahi he
 If more high profile people join this party in the coming few weeks, then it will not be much surprise
 badlaav kii ibaarat likhi ja chuki he
 It has started in Delhi, the whole country is yet to be
 uddhav bole- mukhyamantri pad kaa sawaal ahmajarurat padi to amit shah bhi aa sakate hanmaharashtra chunaav ke parinaam rashtriya janatantric gathbandhan (endie) ke paksh main aae hai
 The Bharatiya Janata Party and Shiv Sena alliance have comfortably touched the absolute majority figure
 bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) ne 105 siten jiti hai
 Its alliance partner Shiv Sena has won 56 seats
 maharashtra main bhaajapa-shivasena kii jodi jiti jarur he lekin nattejey vaise nahin rahe jaisi unhen ummid thi
 After clearing the picture of the NDA government, Shiv Sena Supremo Uddhav Thackeray held a press conference on Thursday evening
 is press conference ke dauraan bhi shivasena adhyaksh ne vahi puraane talkh tevar dikhaae, jo vah chunaav ke pehle se dikhaate aa rahe the
 He also spoke openly on what is in the mind of the Shiv Sena president
 uddhav ne saaf kiya ki vah apane 50-50 ke formule par adig hai
 On the Chief Minister's question, he said that who will be the next Chief Minister of Maharashtra? This is a big question
 yah masalaa ahm he
 The Shiv Sena president also said that BJP national president Amit Shah can also come here if needed
 shivasena adhyaksh kii press conference se ek baat saaf ho gai ki vah narmi baratane ke mood main bilkul bhi nahin he
 Shiv Sena has always demanded the role of elder brother in the politics of the state
 pichley chunaav main isi khinchataan main siton par talmail na hone ke baad donon dalon ne alag-alag chunaav ladaa tha
 Though the BJP later emerged as the single largest party with 122 seats, the Shiv Sena joined the government after the election results were announced
 badale halaat main uddhav kii pressure politicsis baar halaat alag hai
 BJP has fallen from 122 seats to 105 seats
 vahiin shivasena pichhali dafe jiti 63 siton ke aankade dur he he
 In such a situation, Uddhav feels that this is the right time to pressurize the BJP
 bataa den ki chunaav se pehle bhi bhaajapa, shivasena koupamukhyamantrica pad ofer karti rahi he, lekin sena mukhyamantri pad par najar gadaaye he
 One thing is clear from Uddhav's attitude that the Shiv Sena will not let the BJP run the government at least as easily as last time
 2011 main bhrashtachar ke khilaaf deshvyapiandolan chhedane vaale anna hajaareab centre kii modi sarkaar ke khilaaf pradarshan karenge
 This time also the issue will be the appointment of Janlokpal
 15 din baad dilli main team anna kii kor cameti kii baithak hogi jisamen andolan kii disha tay hogi
 This announcement by Anna before the Delhi Assembly elections may raise bjp's worries

 Liquor businessman Vijay Mallya, who ran away from banks after taking loans from banks, has offered to repay the entire money
 maalya ne twit kar kaha ki wo puraa paisa lautaane ke liye taiyaar he
 The special thing is that Mallya's offer came just hours after the extradition of Christian Michel, an accused in the Augusta scam
 Politicians and Media are constantly talking loudly about my being a defaulter who has run away with PSU Bank money
 All this is false
 Why don’t i get fair treatment and the same loud noise about my comprehensive settlement offer before the Karnataka High Court
 Sad — Vijay Mallya (@thevijaymallya)december 5, 2018pratyrpan par maalya ne kaha ki uskaa maamla bilkul alag he
 Mallya blamed the media and said that the media form an opinion about his extradition
 maalya ne kaha ki meraa maamla alag he or yah apni kanoonee karrwai puri karegaa
 As far as the bank's money is concerned, i have offered to return it in full 100 percent
 main puri vinamrata se bank or sarkaar se kahata hum ki ve paisa le len
 If my offer was rejected, why? Airlines struggling financially partly becoz of high ATF prices
 Kingfisher was a fab airline that faced the highest ever crude prices of $ 140 / barrel
 Losses mounted and that's where Banks money went
 i have offered to repay 100 % of the Principal amount to them
 Please take it
 — Vijay Mallya (@thevijaymallya)december 5, 2018vijay maalya ne kaha ki netaa or media lagaataar mujhe difolter bataate hue kah rahe ki main bainkon kaa paisa lekar bhaag gaya hum
 This is all wrong
 maalya ne kaha ki mere karnataka hoicourt main setlement ke prastaav kii baat kyon nahin kii jaati
 Mallya said that everyone is treating me unfairly
 For three decades running India’s largest alcoholic beverage group, we contributed thousands of crores to the State exchequers
 Kingfisher Airlines also contributed handsomely to the States
 Sad loss of the finest Airline but still i offer to pay Banks so no loss
 Please take it
 — Vijay Mallya (@thevijaymallya)december 5, 2018maalya ne kaha ki tees saal tak kingfisher ne bharat main sharaab kaa kaarobaar kiya

 kingfisher airlines sarkaar ko bhi bharpoor bhugtan kar rahi thi
 But this illustrious airlines had a sad ending
 phir bhi main bainkon kaa bhugtan karnaa chahta hum jisase unhen koi ghaataa na ho
 Mallya said please accept my offer
 i see the quick media narrative about my extradition decision
 That is separate and will take its own legal course
 The most important point is public money and i am offering to pay 100% back
 i humbly request the banks and government to take it
 If payback refused, WHY ?— Vijay Mallya (@thevijaymallya)december 5, 2018vijay maalya ne kingfisher ke barbaad hone kaa kaaran vimaan ke eendhan main hui badhottaree ko bataaya
 Mallya said that Kingfisher was a brilliant airline that faced the highest price of crude oil at $ 140 per barrel

 On the question of joining hands with the BJP after Mulayam's friendship with Kalyan Singh, Mulayam Singh said that his party has always fought vigorously against communal forces

 Suddenly, the weather took a turn in delhi-ncr on Sunday evening
 kai ilaakon main tej aandhi ke saath boondabandi bhi hui
 Due to this change in weather in the capital and surrounding areas, people have got relief from the heat
 shaam se hi dilli ke ilaakon main boondabandi hui thi
 Talk that the Meteorological Department had predicted partly cloudy skies in the capital and NCR on Sunday evening with very light rain, dust storm, thunderstorms
 bataa den ki rajdhani main shanivaar ko adhiktam taapmaana 38
 7 ° c while the minimum temperature is 22
 4 degree celsius darj kiya gaya tha
 At the same time, in many parts of Rajasthan, apart from Delhi, dusty thunderstorm accompanied by strong winds on Sunday evening affected life
 kuch jagahon par boondabandi bhi hui
 a Meteorological Department spokesperson said that in the evening after a strong heat of the day, there was a dust storm in Pilani, Sikar, Jhunjhunu, Churu, Bikaner and the capital Jaipur with sudden strong winds
 churu or sriganganagar main boondaabaadi hui
 He said that the storm occurred in the capital Jaipur at a speed of 40 km per hour
 idhar sikar main shaam ko ai aandhi se kai ilaakon main bijli vyavastha prabhavit hui
 According to the Meteorological Department, light to very heavy rains may occur in many parts of the country this week
 jabaki kai ilaakon main dhul bhari aandhi bhi chal sakati he
 According to the department, on April 8, West Bengal, Sikkim, Odisha, Assam, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram and Tripura may receive light rains with strong winds
 jabaki bihar, jharkhand, kerala, karnataka andhra pradesh, telugana, tamilnadu ou chhattisgarh main tej barish ho sakati he
 At the same time, Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal, Odisha, Assam, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram and Tripura may receive light rain on April 9
 jabaki 10 or 11 april ko haryana, dilli, rajasthan or gujarat main garm hawaaon kaa sitam dekhne ko mil saktaa he
 Rajasthan also maintained its tradition of changing power in five years
 199 siton ke liye hue chunaav main se bhartiya janata party ko maatr 73 siten or congress ko 99 siten dekar matadaataaon ne vasundhara raaje kii aguai vaali bhaajapa sarkaar kii vidaai or congress sarkaar ke liye satta kaa rasta taiyaar kar diya
 Interestingly, the difference in vote percentage between Congress and BJP was not much
 congress ko 39
 Got 3 percent votes, which is just 0 from bjp's vote
 5 pratishat adhik he
 Of course, the votes polled by the Congress were not much higher than the BJP, but the Congress got more votes than in 2013
 apane 67 varshiya kattar pratidwandvi ashok gahalot, jinke mukhyamantri rahete 2013 ment hue chunaavon main congress apane sabase nimnatam str 21 siton par pahunch gai thi, ke ulat 65 varshiya raaje ne 2008 ke chunaav ke apane pradarshan ko lagbhag barkaraar rakhaa
 The BJP had then won 78 seats
 is baar ek antar yah rahaa ki raaje ke saamne mukhya pratidwandvi ke rup main congress ke sachin payalat the
 An excited Pilot says, "our seats have increased five times this time compared to the last election
 haalanki yah badhat or ho sakati thi, phir bhi ham apane pradarshan se santusht hai
 Pilots have been ahead in the race for the post of Chief Minister
 haalanki gahalot kaa anubhav un par baari pad saktaa he
 Pilot, who was appointed State Congress President in 2014 at the hands of Congress President Rahul Gandhi, had to take note of the choice of Leader of Opposition Rameshwar Doody along with Gehlot during ticket distribution (while Doody himself lost the election)
 iske parinamswaroop party kam yuvaaon ko maidan main utaar saki
 With this, the Congress had to be content only with a big victory where it could get a clear majority
 party ne 40 saal se kam umr vaale 40 ummidavaar utaare the jisamen se 26 jeet gaye
 Pilot claims that the party was trusted by the public as it gave young faces a chance
 payalat ne pradesh adhyaksh ke rup main apni pari kii shuruyaat aage badhkar chunautiyon kaa saamana karne ko taiyaar netaa ke rup main kii
 Though he felt that the Narendra Modi wave would make it difficult for him through the Lok Sabha, he decided to contest the Lok Sabha by-election from Ajmer and held rallies and demonstrations to protest against inflation and rape
 unka andaaj gahalot se ekadam ulat rahaa he, jo khud ke gandhivadi hone kaa daawa karne ke baavjood, shaayad hi kabhi jamini str par hone vaale kisi andolan main bhaag lete hai
 Pilot was successful in uniting the divided workers inside the party and under his leadership, the Congress won two Lok Sabha and one Assembly seats this year
 rahul ne bhi dhire-dhire rajasthan main payalat ke liye rasta banaaya or gahalot ko rajya kii raajnneeti se nikaalkar dilli main sanghathan sachiv banaaya
 However, he did not project Pilot as Chief Minister as he expected opposition from the Gehlot camp
 payalat kii is mahatvapurn safalataa main rajasthan kii har jati or samudaayon kaa yogadan rahaa he
 For example, the Gurjar community pilots in the Meenas-dominated Bharatpur area were able to win 14 seats while the BJP got only one
 yah haal tab rahaa jab modi, shah or aresas kii ichha par, baghawat karke party chhod chuke kirodilal meena kii bhaajapa main vaapasi bhi karai gai
 The results also show that Pilot's strategy of traveling across the state to highlight the shortcomings and malpractices of the state and central governments was a huge success and he was successful in connecting the public with the Congress
 in yatraaon ke dauraan unhone shahari kshetron main bhi buniyadi suvidhaon kii baari kami kii baat ko bhi jor-shor se uchhaala
 Perhaps this is the reason why Congress won 29 seats in Jaipur division while BJP got only 10 seats
 payalat kehete hai, "meraa dhyaan sirf vidhansabha chunaavon par nahin balki 2019 ke aam chunaavon ke liye jameen taiyaar karne par bhi tha
 "actually, this victory has inspired the party workers so much that they are also hoping to re-form the government in the 2023 assembly elections, changing the tradition of change of power every five years in the state
" cabinet mantri arun chaturvedi ko haraakar jaipur civil lines se jite pratap singh khachariyavaas kehete hai, "ham aam chunaav to jeetenge hi 2023 kaa chunaav bhi jeetenge
 The defeat of 16 ministers of the Raje government, two of the assembly's vice-presidents, two sons of ministers, six parliamentary secretaries and four rebel ministers indicates the extent to which the government had become unpopular
 jaahir he raaje, jo sarkaar ko digital mod main laane main hi vyast raheen, apane adhikariyon par lagaam nahin kas sakin
 Despite the direct transfer of benefits, corruption was rampant at the panchayat level and his efforts to digitize the panchayati raj were even opposed by the minister
 prashasan ke har str par aakshamata or bhrashtachar kaa bolbalaa tha, lekin farvari ke upachunaav haarane ke baavjood na to raaje ne or na hi bhaajapa ne aksham mantriyon ko hataaya
 The current BJP mlas further fueled anti-incumbency among the voters
 pichhali baar jeetne vaale 163 main se 60 vidhayak pehali baar chune gaye the or unamem se zyaadaatar modi lahar par savaar hokar jite the lekin chunaav jeetne ke baad unka puraa dhyaan transfar posting se paise banane par rahaa
 The bjp's own internal poll before the election also saw very little chance of mlas winning again, so the party wanted to cut the ticket of around 100 mlas, but ultimately only 54 were cut
 raaje ke mantriyon ko bhi bahut ghamandi mana jaataa tha jo chunaav kshetron tak main bhi kam hi gaye
 Raje has had differences with both Modi and Shah and even when the three leaders came together during the election campaign, most people did not take it seriously
 apni aakhri reliyon main modi ne ek baar bhi raaje kaa zikr tak nahin kiya
 Worse still, the party wasted three important months in choosing a new president even after Ashok Parnami stepped down as state president due to a mutual tussle between Shah and Raje
 jaipur kii adarsh nagar seat se chunaav lade paranami ko congress ke rafique khan ne 13,000 se zyada maton se haraa diya
 75-year-old Madan Lal Saini, the new state president in place of Parnami, also failed to cross the bjp's boat
 bhaajapa ne notebandi or jiesti ke kaaran naaraaz chote or madhyam vyapaariyon ke apane vot bank ko bhi nazarandaaj kiya
 Similarly, the Supreme Court ruled not to arrest the suspects immediately under the SC / ST Act, but the obcs and forward castes were also angered by the Central Government's attempts to quash them
 apni jati se taalluk rakhane vaale do sarganaon kii police muthbhed main hatya se rajput khaase aavesh main the or unhone bhaajapa se kinaaraa karnaa shuru kar diya tha
 Although Raje would have tried to talk to Rajput leaders, he could have been persuaded
 bhaajapa ko ummid thi ki hindutv ke mudde ko uthaakar or musalamaanon ko nishane par lekar maahaul ko apane paksh main badla ja saktaa he lekin aisa ho na sakaa
 In the country's first go-minister Ottaram Dewasi Sirohi, an independent and Congress rebel candidate lost to Sanyam Lodha by 10,000 votes
 party kaa un kshetron main pradarshan bahut kharaab rahaa jahaan gaayon ko lekar bheed ne hinsa kii ghatnaayen anjaam di thim
 Apart from this, the Tonk where the Muslim population is quite good, the bjp's only Muslim candidate who contested against Pilot and the minister in the Raje government, Yunus Khan, before giving ticket to him, also angered the Muslim community
 Was
 rajyabar main apni yatra ke baavjood, raaje logon ke dimag se yah dharna dur kar paane main naakaam raheen ki ve logon se milanaa-julna pasand nahin karatin
 This time he was considered very unpopular
 iske alaava, sarkari karmchaariyon ko bhi apni samasyaon ke samaadhaan ke liye unke mantriyon kii dayaa par chhod diya gaya tha
 He was accused of patronizing the sand and mining mafia
 is haar ke peeche ek or vajah yah he ki matadaata party ko apane vaade se mukarne vaali or vishwasghaatee maan rahe the
 For most of his tenure, Raje kept on crying about the disastrous economic situation in the state, but before the elections, the public's ludicrous declaration of loan waiver of up to Rs
 50,000 and reimbursement of Rs
 10,000 per annum for farmers' electricity expenditure also benefited him
 Could not reach because they completely failed to implement the revised minimum support price
 bhaajapa ne is tathy ko nazarandaaj kar diya tha ki aakhri samay main kiye gaye lok lubhaavan vaade pradesh main vot nahin dilaa pate
 In 2013, Gehlot also tried, but to no avail
 phir bhi, raaje apni kalyankari yojanaon kii badaulat kuch kshetron main vot batorne main kaamyaab dikhti hai

 Raje has left an empty treasury for the new government and it will be difficult for the Congress to fulfill its promise of debt waiver and new employment opportunities
 jaipur neshnal uniwarsity ke kulapati sandip bakshi kehete hai, "congress ko matadaataaon kii badhati aakankshaon ko puraa karne ke liye netritv main parivartan kii jarurat he
 However, Pilot says that Congress has made only those promises which can be fulfilled
 ve kehete hai, "chintaa na karen, ham nai oonchaaiyaan chhuenge
 "people of the state have expected something similar from the new government
 dekhnaa he ki nai sarkaar unki aas puri karti he yaa niraash karti he
 Why did the BJP lose - the party which claims to reach one crore voters and has an impressive booth management has been caught in a tussle for three months over the appointment of its state president

 com / zp7xqj3kxl— ANI (@ani)october 16, 2019isse pehle chidambaram kii jamaanat yachika par kendriya anveshan beuro (sibiai) ne supreme court main jawaab daakhil kiya
 The CBI opposed the bail application of p Chidambaram
 sibiai ne kaha is maamle kii jaanch abhi chal rahi he
 Chidambaram is a very influential person, he can impress witnesses
 unhone nijee laabh ke liye desh ke ucch pad kaa istemaal kiya
 What is the matter? Chidambaram has been in judicial custody since Chidambaram was arrested on August 21 for his alleged irregularity in sanctioning INX Media to the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) during his tenure as finance minister 
 ucchtam nyaayalay ne kaha ki tu ji spectrum maamle main sibiai jaanch kaa dayera badhaane ke saath hi isamen varsh 2001 kii un ghatnaon ko bhi shaamil kiya janaa chahie jab rajg sarkaar ne spectrum aavanton ke liye vivaadaaspad ‘pehle aao pehle paao kii niti’ kii shuruuaat kii thi
 Justice es
 Singhvi and Justice A
 ke
 Ganguly's bench said, 'the issues that are arising in this case are just 1
 76 lakh karod rupee tak simit nahin hai, balki inkaa dayera or adhik he
 We do not want to be biased in this investigation, but also need to look at what happened in 2001
 ab yah sibiai kaa kaam he ki vah jaanch kare or pataa lagaae ki kya hua tha
 The judges' remarks are also significant because former Telecom Minister a Raja consistently maintained that he was following in the footsteps of his predecessors and had followed the 2001 policy
 varsh 2001 main sarkaar nilaamee kii niti par nahin chalati thi or spectrum kaa aavanton pehle aao-pehle paao ke aadhaar par hota tha
 The bench raised questions on the feasibility of such a telecom policy in which spectrum was allocated in the year 2007-2008 at the rate of 2001
 peeth ne kaha ki yah niti betuki he
 The bench taunted the government and said that it should supply petrol at the rate of 2001
 yaayalay ne kaha, ‘is vanijyik vishwa main sabhi companiyaan apane vyavsaayik hit kaa dhyaan rakhti hai
 Why don't you give us petrol at the price of year 2001
 yadi aap ise niti bhi qaraar dete hai to yah ek betuki niti he
 The Supreme Court also commented on the policy on transfer of dual technology, CDMA and GSM, stating that while the notification regarding dual technology was issued on October 19, 2009, a service provider was allowed the day before
 
 peeth ne kaha, ‘tii aar adhyarjun (e raja ke vakil) ne jis taraf dhyaan dilaayaa, vah usase kahin zyada he, jo ankhon se dikh rahaa he
 The bench also said that even the CAG did not pay attention to the issue of dual technology
 peeth ke mutabik, ‘is mudde kii jaanch nahin kii gai
 The bench said, "why don't you investigate this issue since 2001
" ’ peeth ne is baat par bhi jor diya ki pehle aao-pehle paao ke aadhaar par spectrum aavanton kaa shulk usee samay nirdhaarit kiya gaya tha
 Appearing for the CBI, senior advocate KK Venugopal told the bench about the progress of the investigation into the spectrum scam that the investigating agency had raided Raja's residences in the capital Delhi, Chennai and Bangalore
 unhone kaha ki agency is jaanch ke liye kadi mehnat kar rahi he or nyaayalay ko bhi iske prayaas karne chahie ki jaanch ke bare main jaankaree saarvajanik na ho
 To this, the bench said, 'you want to keep the investigation confidential but all the television channels are showing the raids you have killed on the channel
 ’vahiin jaanch kii ucchtam nyaayalay dwaara nigaraanee kii maang karne vaali gaiyr sarkari sanstha centre for public interest litigeshan kii ore se adhivaktaa prashanth bhushan ne kaha, ‘sibiai dwaara maare gaye in chhaapon kaa koi matlab nahin he
 He said that despite the complaint of Janata Party President Subramaniam Swamy and others, the agency kept sitting hand in hand for one year
 sibiai ne shikaayat par karrwai karne kii bajaay lagbhag ek varsh baad 21 aktubar 2009 ko agyaat logon ke khilaaf ek praathmiki darj kii
 The facts for which the CBI conducted the raid were known to him only at the time of filing the FIR
 venugopal ne kaha ki is ghotaale main jaanch agle varsh farvari tak puri ho jaaegi lekin yah desh tak hi simit hogi kyonki desh ke baahar jaanch ke liye or samay kii jarurat hogi
 The Enforcement Directorate also presented the report of its investigation in the case in a sealed envelope
 adaalat main apni report jamaa karte hue atirikt solicytor general haren rawal ne peeth ko bataaya ki isamen dhan shodhan nirodhak adhinium or videshi mudra vinimay prabandhan adhinium ke tahat darj maamle kii nau march, 2010 se kii gai jaanch kaa vivaran he
 The bench rejected cbi's suggestion that the court give orders related to the case in sealed envelopes
 peeth ne kaha, ‘silband lipaphe main die gaye aadesh, nyaay ke liye hitkar nahin honge
 Dismissing the cbi's suggestion, the bench said, "court proceedings, case hearings and court orders are not affected by any criticism
" bhale hi vah nichali adaalat ho yaa ucchtam nyaayalay, use samvidhan or janhit ko dhyaan main rakhte hue apni budhimatta se kaam karnaa hota he
 The bench said that the hearing of the case is being held in open court and even after some things have been tampered with in the news, whatever is being said has no effect on the proceedings of the court
 adaalat ne kaha, ‘silband lipaphe main aadesh dena, nyaay ke liye hitkar nahin hoga
 It cannot be justified as it will give rise to speculation
 ’ peeth ne kaha, ‘ham apane niyamon se chalane vaale hai
 On this point, KK Venugopal, appearing in the court on behalf of the CBI, said that it is for the court to decide whether to give its order in sealed envelopes or in open court

 Earlier, Chief Economic Advisor of the Ministry of Finance, Kaushik Basu, had said in an event in Kolkata that if explained to the Chief Minister of West Bengal, she can also understand that FDI in multi-brand retail is for West Bengal from all sides
 There is a deal of benefits
 mukhyamantri ne jahiraa taur par basu ke isi bayaan ke maddenjar kaha, main jo faisla karti hum, us par amal karti hum
 We do not need FDI in multi-brand retail business
 ham ise manjuur nahin karenge or meri sarkaar kii niti yahi he
 Banerjee came here to take stock of the law and order situation in the district
 tippaniyan Basu had said in a meeting with members of the India Chamber of Commerce in Kolkata, Mamata is sensible, but the case of FDI in retail is very complex
 yadi isko unhen samajhaayaa jaae, to vah yah jaan jaaengi ki yah pashchim bengal ke logon ke liye har tarah se laabh kaa sauda he
 It is noteworthy that the government had decided to allow 51 per cent FDI in multi-brand retail business but it was postponed after opposition from Trinamool Congress and opposition of Mamata Banerjee, the ruling coalition UPA at the center
 isse pehle vittamantralay ke mukhya aarthik salaahkaar kowshik basu ne kolkata main ek kaarykram main kaha tha ki yadi pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri ko samajhaayaa jaae, to vah bhi yah samaj sakati he ki bahu brands khudara kshetra main pratyaksh videshi nivesh pashchim bengal ke liye har taraf se phaayde kaa sauda he
 The Chief Minister apparently said in view of this statement of Basu, "I take the decision that i make

 We will not accept it and this is the policy of my government

 99 pratishat logon ke liye pradhanmantri ban janaa ek naammumkin sapane ke sach ho jane jaisaa hoga, lekin kam logon ke liye, bahut kam logon ke liye aisa ho janaa katai maamuli baat he
 Sonia Gandhi, as a daughter-in-law, entered a Prime Minister's residence, lived in a second Prime Minister's residence as a wife, and eventually reached a position where she could decide who would become the next Prime Minister
 rahul gandhi apni daadi ke pradhanmantri awaas main paidaa hue, pita ke pradhanmantri awaas main paley-bade, or iske baad desh kii sabase taqatvar netaa ke putr ke rup main raajnneeti kii
 The same applies to Priyanka Gandhi Vadra
 unke kehane bhar kii der he, pradhanmantri pad unka ho jayega, lekin mudda yah he ki kya ve aisa chaahate hai
 
 
 The Would this position also tempt them in such a way that it tempts us all
 mujhe yaad he, varsh 1999 main main 10, janpath main priyanka se mila tha, jab vah ek khidki par khadi thim
 i asked if she would stand in the coming election, she immediately replied, "at the moment i am standing only in this window
 
 
 " i also remember how i had to remind myself again and again that the person i am sitting with is no fellow of the Doon School, the Prime Minister of the country
 yah dekhnaa achambhit kar detaa tha ki koi shaks kitni jaldi bade pad ke kaamkaaj se saamanjasy bitha saktaa he, or kitna jaldi yah bada pad uske liye maamuli baat banakar rah saktaa he
 We have to remember these things when we will try to find an answer to the question - whether Priyanka will say 'yes' or 'no' - to everyone's mind despite repeated answers by the affiliated party
 khayr, unhone kaha he - nahin
 
 
 So why can't we end this issue right here
 
 
 ? But with this the speculation started
 
 
 arun jetali ne priyanka ke raajnneeti main sambhavit pravesh ko 'rajmahal main takhtapalat' kii sangya is tarah de daali, jaise vahi sab kuch jaanate hon
 One can get a sense of reality by just looking at the pictures of this couple of brothers and sisters together - how much the two brothers and sisters love each other, how much support both brothers and sisters have for each other , How the two siblings depend on each other
 
 
 or arun jetali jaisaa katai bahari vyakti apni rajnatik rotiyaan senkane ke liye ise pratidwandvita bataane lagata he, jise darasal yah bhi nahin maaloom hoga ki party main kya chal rahaa he, or kya nahin
 There can be no two opinions on this that Priyanka is very valuable for the party
 is par kisi ko leshmaatr bhi andeh nahin ki party antartam se unki shirkat chaahati he
 This excited party workers and voters that seeing them reminded Indira Gandhi, and listening to them, memories of Rajiv Gandhi became tangible
 yah nishchit he ki unka party main hameshaa dil kholkar se swaagat kiya jayega, yahaan tak ki adhiktar congressi unke swaagat ke liye palak-paanvade bicha denge
 But who we are, to tell them whether they should move towards their 'destiny in office'
 yah un par, or sirf un par nirbhar karata he
 If for any reason she decides that she does not want to do it now - or ever -, the party has no choice but to move forward without getting along
 yaa, spasht kaha jaae to, kuch had tak unke saath badhen, kyonki apni maa or bhai ke nirvachan kshetron kii prabharee to vah hai hi, jahaan narendra modi kii antim samay main vinamrata ke daayre se baahar aakar kii gai koshishon ke baavjood party ko shandaar jeet hasil hui
 He was Modi, who had to run away from Amethi and Rae Bareli by pressing the tail
 koi raajnneeti main hue bina gahan rajaneta ho saktaa he
 Priyanka is both - an intense politician as well, outside politics
 parantu zaruri nahin ki hameshaa aisa hi rahe
 Maybe someday, she feels that she has fulfilled her responsibilities towards the family, and now she can step into the quagmire of politics
 lekin yah bhi ho saktaa he ki vah din kabhi na aae, kam se kam mere jaise umrdaraj netaaon kii baaki rajnatik zindagi main to nahin
 But young or old - it would be unethical for any of us to speculate about Priyanka's life, and tell them that they have no choice but to come forward to help a losing party
 
 yah nirnay puri tarah unka khud kaa hoga
 Just like he belonged to his mother
 bahut zyaada lanbaa vakt nahin beetaa he, jab kis tarah hamamen se kai (jinamein natwar singh bhi shaamil the) sonia se lagaataar aagrah kar rahe the ki vah party sambhaal len
 We thought her mourning would be one year old, but she remained engulfed by her grief even after that
 party tut gai (jiske aguva natwar singh the)
 She did not bother jab varsh 1996 main chunavi paridrishy ulatney par seetaram kesari ne pivi narsimha raav ko baahar kar mere samet kai netaaon ko hataash kar diya, sonia phir bhi 10, janpath ke darvaaze kasakar band kiye raheen
 Then the disintegration of the Congress, in which i moved with Mamata Banerjee, was probably the initial stone slipping, which gradually turned into an eclipse
 or phir apane ghar ke aasapaas tahaltey-tahaltey sonia ne apane pati tathaa sasuraal ke vikhyath logon kii tasviren dekhin, jinhone unhen prerana di ki vah apni ashankaon ko bhilkar us party ko bachaaen, jise paalane-posane ke liye unhone bahut kuch kiya tha
 It was a call of duty that brought him into active politics
 media ne us vakt kis tarah khilli udayi thi
 
 
 How a prominent woman politician had let down all the women by warning that if a foreigner becomes the Prime Minister of independent India, she will shave her head
 
 
 kis tarah unhen chun-chunakar nasli gaaliyaan dene vaala shaks unki choukhat par bina bulaae bhi khadaa dikhaai diya, jab unhone adiyal endie ko patkhni dete hue swayambhu 'rambhakton' ke liye 10 saal ke vanvaas kii shuruyaat kar di thi
 Therefore, there is absolutely no need for any of us to request Priyanka, try to persuade her, or threaten her
 vah nehru-gandhi hai
 They know their duties very well
 jab zarurat padegi - or zarurat tabhi padegi, jab ham gahare sankat main honge - unhen pataa chal jayega ki unke liye saamne aane kaa vakt aa gaya he
 If we can normalize the situation by bringing ourselves out of the current situation - which is quite possible - then Priyanka can spend time sitting on the couch comfortably reading her favorite books
 vaise bhi yah saaf zaahir he ki vah aatma se congress ke saath hai
 Whether she joins the party or not is entirely up to her
 or unka nirnay kuch bhi ho, abhi yaa bhavishya main, vah hameshaa party ke hit main hi hoga
 "and yes, the magic of 'namo' is going down for the 'unholy' sitting in BJP
 
 
 centre main satta badalane ke baad hue teen upachunaavon main se sabhi congress ke paksh main gaye hai
 
 
 And the rest of the damage caused by the 'great illusion of Modi' will also be recovered in the upcoming assembly elections
 
 
 " The hallucination of the 'gogia Pasha' of electoral politics among the general public as well as among the bjp's second line leaders will gradually go away
 ab se ek-do saal main hi saadhaaran buddhi waalon kii samaj main bhi sangh parivaar kii nishchit haar spasht dikhne lagegi
 At that time BJP, as we are seeing today in Uttar Pradesh, will play communal card with the help of Bajrang Dal and others
 us vakt priyanka apni bhoomika nibhaaengi
 Probably not taking any formal position in the party, but to protect the secular India which is facing the biggest and most serious threat since 1947
