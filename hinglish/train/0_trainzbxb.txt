 Encouraged by the victory in the Test series for the first time in Australia, the Indian team is in the news due to activities outside Pandya and Lokesh Rahul's ground
 donon ne ek tivi sho main mahilaon par vivaadit tippanee kii jisase un par do maichon ke nilamban kaa khatra mandara rahaa he
 On the eve of the first match to be played on Saturday, Kohli said, 'in India we played against the West Indies with a finger spinner and a wrist spinner
 hamaare liye yah acha he ki jadeja kii tarah kaa khilaadi maujuud hai, jo aisi sthiti (pandya par pratibandh lagane se) main harfanmaulaa kii bhoomika nibhaa saktaa he
 He said, 'we are not too worried as a team, because you will always face the situation of balancing the team
 ham aise khilaadiyon ko team main rakhte hai, jo jarurat padane par balle or gend se yogadan dene ke maamle main duusare kii jagah le sake
 When asked if he would play in Australia's Big Bash League after retiring or the bcci's ban being lifted, Kohli said he would certainly not be available for any such tournament after retiring
 australia ke khilaaf shanivaar ko hone vaale pehle vanade international match kii purv sandhya par bhartiya captain ne kaha, ‘dekhiye mujhe nahin pataa ki bhavishya main is tarah ke rukh main badlaav aata he yaa nahin
 As far as i am concerned, once i retire and play cricket, to be honest, i do not think i am included in those people
 ’mahange pade bigade bol, sidney vanade se out hue hardik pandya-keel rahulabi divilliars or brendan makkulam jaise sanyas le chuke cricketer niyamit taur par ipel or big bash lig jaisi tii-20 lig main khelte hai, lekin kohli ne kaha ki unki is suchi me judane main koi ruchi nahin he
 He said, "I have played enough cricket in the last five years and i cannot even comment on what the first thing i will do after retiring is because i don't think i will bat again
" ’ kohli ne kaha, ‘jis din main khelnaa band karuunga us din meri sari urja khatm ho chuki hogi or yahi kaaran he ki main cricket khelnaa chhod duungaa
 Therefore, i do not see any possibility of playing on the field again
 ’kohli ne kaha ki vah team ke maujuuda sangyojan se khush hai or 30 may se england main shuru hone vaale vanade world cap ke liye team main zyada badlaav kii gunjaaish nahin he
 The Indian captain said, "we don't have much matches left before the World Cup, so we want to play with almost the same team who played in the World Cup more or less
 jasprit bumraah kaa maamla alag he
 He is rested given the weight of the Test match
 unke alaava mujhe nahin lagata ki ham team sangyojan ke bare main zyada vichaar karenge
 However, Kohli said that the decision will be taken after looking at form and fitness for some places in the team
 unhone kaha, ‘team main ek-do aise sthaan hai, jahaan aapako badlaav karnaa pad saktaa he, lekin iske alaava ham world cap se pehle isi sangyojan ke saath khelnaa chaahate hai
 'pandya and Rahul may not be available for the opening matches of the three-match series, to which Kohli said that this will give them a chance to experiment with the fast bowlers
 COA kahegi tabhi pehla vanade khelenge hardik pandya, keel rahul: kohliunhone kaha, ‘bhubaneshwar kumaar kii vaapasi hui he
 He was working hard during the Test series
 khalil ahamed ko jo maukey mili hai usne usamen acha pradarshan kiya he
 Mohammed Shami has the ability to take wickets with a new ball
 unke paas khud ko team main sthapit karne kaa mauka hoga
 The Indian captain said that the team's attention has not been distracted by the case of Rahul and Pandya
 unhone kaha, ‘hamen maidan main jaakar pradarshan karnaa he
 These external factors will not affect our motivation and preparations for the World Cup

 inputah IANS Although Team India has defeated Zimbabwe by five-nil, but after a short time, Fans will probably remember this series as if only one episode is left
 
 
 
 Despite a five-zero win, cricket experts would not consider it a big win
 ise team india ke itihaas main badi jeet ke naam se darj nahin kiya jayega
 Winning the entire series, Team India's rating increased by just one point
 122 se 123
 In such a situation, the ODI series in Zimbabwe was a great opportunity to polite at least many young players, but Team India captain Virat Kohli and team management were not successful in this task
 parvaiz rasul hameshaa hameshaa bench par hi rahe
 Ajinkya Rahane got a chance in only one match and he did not let him fail on his half-century
 rabindra jadeja ko yahaan kuch sabit karne kii zarurat nahin thi
 In a way, he was relegated to a five-for-five match without stopping others from taking a chance
 rabindra jadeja ne series main paanch wicket jatke or aakhri match main naabad 48 ran banaakar paanch match main kul 63 ran apane upar se naakaami kaa boj utaar diya
 Despite all this, can it be called a successful mission
 
 
 zimbabwe ke kilaaf jeet hasil karne se fans khush ho sakate hai lekin iske utane number nahin milenge jitne ki ek majboot team ke kilaaf jeet se milte
 The purpose of this tour was not only to win against Zimbabwe but also to try young players
 
 
 lekin team management or captain kohli aisa karne se kyon chook gaye
 
 
 The parvaiz rasul ko aakhri match main bhi mauka dene se chookkar kohli ne jeet ke rang main puri team ko nikharane kaa mauka nahin diya
 He could also be included in the team in place of Ravindra Jadeja
 paanch match main paanch wicket hasilakar jadeja ne apni kaabiliyat se alag kuch khaas nahin sabit kiya
 The comments iske alaava, captain kohli rahane ko bhi thik se aazamaa nahin paae
 Rahane was relieved to get a chance in the last match
 
 
 ajinkya rahane ne pari main sabase zyada pachaas ran bhi banaae lekin sirf ek maukey se rahane kya sabit kar sakate hai
 
 
 
 khilaadiyon kii sahi aazamaaish team management ke homework kii pahchaan hoti he or is baar jeet ke baavjood team management kaa yah pahalu halkaa nazar aayaa

 Pervez Rasul was always on the bench
 ajinkya rahane ko sirf ek match main mauka mila or ardhshtak thokkar unhone apane upar naakaami kaa thappa nahin lagane diya
 Ravindra Jadeja did not have to prove anything here
 ek tarah se unhen bina matlab paanch ke paanch match main utarkar dusron ko mauka lene se roak diya gaya
 Ravindra Jadeja took five wickets in the series and scored an unbeaten 48 runs in the last match and a total of 63 runs in five matches to lift the burden of failure
 kya in sabake baavjood ise kaamyaab mishan kah sakate hai
 
 
 Fans may be happy to win against Zimbabwe but will not get as many numbers as they would have won against a strong team
 is daure kaa makasad sirf zimbabwe ke kilaaf jeet hasil karnaa nahin balki yuva khilaadiyon ko aazmaana bhi tha
 
 
 But why did the team management and captain Kohli miss doing this
 
 
 ? Kohli missed the chance to give Parvez Rasool a chance in the last match as well, not allowing the entire team to flourish in the color of victory
 unhen rabindra jadeja kii jagah bhi team main shaamil kiya ja saktaa tha
 Taking five wickets in five matches, Jadeja proved nothing different from his ability
 tippaniyan Apart from this, captain Kohli also failed to try Rahane properly
 aakhri match main mauka milane se rahane ko raahat to mili
 
 
 Ajinkya Rahane also scored the most fifty runs in the innings, but what can Rahane prove only with one chance
 
 
 
 The correct trial of the players identifies the homework of the team management, and this time despite the victory, this aspect of the team management looked light

 It has also been said in the petition that the titles given by the Government of India such as Bharat Ratna, Padma Bhushan, Padma Shri are valid in the country

 36-year-old Dhoni m
 chinnaswami stadium main buudhvaar raat ko royal chalangers bengalooru ke khilaaf 34 gendon par kheli gai 70 ran kii naabad pari ke dauraan yah uplabdhi hasil kii
 Dhoni has become the first batsman in the world to achieve this record
 captain dhoni ne apni pari ke dauraan saat chakke bhi udaae
 This is the first time he has hit the maximum seven sixes in an IPL innings
 unhone 2013 ke baad se pehali baar ipel ke ek sijan main do ardhashatak banaae hai
 dhoni-kohli, who was on the field, was also walking in sakshi-anushka
 After the match, a contestant said after the match that it is important that you always keep in mind how many overs are left and who will bowl in these death overs
 bengalooru ke khilaaf chennai ke saamne 206 ranon kii vishaal chunauti thi, uske 74 ran par chaar wicket gir gaye the or yahaan se jeet ke liye 11 over main 132 ranon kii darkaar thi
 CSK was in danger of losing, but Dhoni came up with something else
 mandara rahaa tha haar kaa khatra, phir chalaa maahi kaa balla or mil gai jeetakptain mahendra singh dhoni ne 34 gendon main naabad 70 ranon kii tabadatod pari kheli or haar ke jabade se jeet chhinakar CSK ko dilaa di
 In this way, Chennai achieved the target of 206 runs from Bengaluru by scoring 207 runs for the loss of five wickets with two balls remaining

 "I am not disappointed with the result," Dhoni said after India's 1-0 series win with a third Test draw
 hamane is mainch main acha pradarshan kiya
 We tried our best to get wickets but they batted very well
 bhartiya captain ne kaha, yah kaaphi dhimaa wicket tha
 However, Harbhajan Singh was getting turn and bounce
 unhone (duusari pari main) chaar wicket chatkaakar acha pradarshan kiya
 However the fast bowlers were not getting much help and it was quite difficult to bowl with the old ball
 dhoni ne anivaary over khatm hone ke baad test dra karaane par raji hone ke faisle kaa bachaav karte hue kaha, agar ham lakshya kaa peechha karte to shrinkhalaa jeetne kaa mauka nikal saktaa tha
 We realized that trying to win is not beneficial
 hamane shuru main koshish kii lekin ham shrinkhalaa jitkar khush hai
 West Indies captain Darren Sammy also expressed surprise at India's not trying to win
 unhone kaha, main hairaan hum (ki teen wicket girane ke baad unhone lakshya kaa peechha nahin karne kaa faisla kiya)
 Dhoni praised the young players especially Ishant Sharma for his good performance in the series, who was also named Man of the Series for taking 22 wickets in the series
 saimi ne match main apane team ke pradarshan par kaha, main nattejey se santusht hum
 We had less of a bowler and despite that it is great to come back and win the match
 shiv (shivanrayan chandrapal) ne sabit kiya ki vah ab bhi hamaare behatar ballebaajon main se ek he
 There are catches in cricket but we did not score enough runs in this series

 Noida adjacent to Delhi succeeded in solving the 42-day-old murder scandal
 aropiyon ko giraftaar kar jab poochtacha kii gai to dimag sunn kar dene vaali vaardaat saamne ai
 According to the police, Ramu, a resident of Farrukhabad, living in Salarpur, Noida, was killed by his friends on January 8 this year
 police ne raamu kii hatya ke aarope main uske donon doston arun or nishanth ko giraftaar kar liya he
 Apart from this, the police have also recovered firewood and brick in the murder
 police ne bataaya ki aaropee arun muradabad kaa rahane vaala he or yahaan icotech-3 ke kulesra main rahata he, jabaki aaropee nishanth salarpur kaa hi rahane vaala he
 Police officials said that on the information of the informer, both the accused were arrested from Nagla stand in Salarpur late Saturday
 poochtacha main aropiyon ne jurm kubul kar liya or puri ghatana kaa khulaasa kiya
 According to the police, Arun and Nishant suspected that Ramu had stolen Nishant's mobile and Rs 5,000
 badla lene ke liye donon ne sharaab pilaane ke bahaane se raamu ko bulaayaa or use lekar khadar chale gaye
 There he attacked Ramu with a knife and killed Ramu
 unhone raamu ke paas pade 1,800 rupee bhi chin liye the
 The two then crushed the face by crushing them with the purpose of hiding the identity of the dead body
 donon itane par bhi nahin maane
 He also tried to burn Ramu's corpse through garbage cans and polythene there, though the corpse could burn only half
 police ko raamu kii laashkshat-vikshat or adhajali avasthaa menmili thi
 The police was investigating the post-mortem examination of the corpse, though his family could not be traced due to the absence of the body
 aropiyon kii giraftaar ke baad police ne raamu ke parijanon ko suchit kiya
 The family identified Ramu on the basis of the photograph
 parijanon ne bataaya ki raamu 7 maheene se ghar nahin aayaa tha
 Meanwhile, he spoke to his family only twice
 jab bete se baat honi band ho gai to parijanon ne bete kii talash karne kii kaaphi koshish kii, lekin unhen uskaa koi ata-pataa nahin mila tha
 There may be a proposal to bring the much-awaited bullet train into the country in the Modi government's railway budget
 railway is bajet main tej raftaar gaadiyaan chalaane ke bare main ghoshnaa kar sakati he
 This news has been given by an English newspaper
 akhbaar ke mutabik railway do prastaavon par vichaar kar rahi he
 One is the introduction of bullet trains running at a speed of 300 kilometers on a particular route and the second is to run trains running at a speed of 130 to 150 kilometers on the existing rail lines
 in prastaavon par jald hi muhar lag sakati he or rail bajet main inaki ghoshnaa ho sakati he
 a railway department official told the newspaper that the railway minister is keen to materialize these proposals
 pradhan mantri narendra modi kii dili ichha he ki desh main tej raftar trainon kaa ek chaturbhuj banaaya jaae tathaa yatriyon ko world class suvidhaayen di jaaen
 Running the bullet train between Mumbai to Ahmedabad and Pune is at the top of the Railways' priority list
 agar is kshetra main 100 pratishat epadiai kii anumati mil jaaegi to yah sambhav ho jayega
 On the other hand, a proposal to increase the speed of trains in the country was placed with the new minister
 iske tahat nae tarah ke dibbe jaise ki dilli metro rail main hai, istemaal kiye jaaenge
 This will increase the speed of trains
 abhi rajdhani express jaisi trainon kii ausat raftaar mahaj 85 kilometre prati ghanta he
 a plan to increase it to 105 km is yet to be worked out
 agar aisa hua to dilli se haavda kii yatra ke samay main saade teen ghante se zyada samay bachaaya ja sakegaa
 They will also save energy
 aisi trainon ko chalaane ke liye coach emport karne padenge
 But they will be twice the price of current coaches
 rail adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki inaki keemat paanch saal main nikal jaaegi

 Let us know which three have caused the most damage by this decision of the Central Government
 1
 India has transformed from the world's fastest running economy to the fastest slowing economy due to Make in Indiannotbanding
 mek in india ko menuphaccharing sector main rojgaar laane vaala nijee nivesh badhaane ke makasad se shuru kiya gaya tha
 The share of investment in India's GDP is around 30 per cent, with most of the investment being from the private sector
 pichley do saal main tamaam koshishon ke baavjood maang main kami or karj ke boj ke kaaran udyogon ne nae nivesh kaa jokhim nahin liya
 In view of the huge reduction in production and demand after demonetisation, the investment enthusiasm for the next several months is about to end
 notebandi ne chote udyogon ko sabase zyada badahaal kiya he
 Extremely small manufacturing and trading units constitute 95 per cent of employment
 jidipi gananaa ke nae formule ke mutabik chote udyog jidipi main 37 fisadi kaa hissaa rakhte hai
 Their share in exports is about 45 per cent
 vaise bhi bharat ke chote udyog ab keval 6,000 chote utpaadon tak simit hai jo saamaanya takanic par aadhaarit hai
 After demonetisation, many units have come to a standstill, which are difficult to revive, and without these, Make in India's re-activation and return of employment is impossible
 2
 Consumption has been severely broken by start-up ban, which is the basis of 60 per cent economic growth and is the biggest attraction of investment in India
 upabhokta utpaada, vaahan, packed food kii maang main tej giravat ke aankade iskaa pramaan hai
 Indeed, the entire start up revolution depended on this consumption consumption
 zyaadaatar unicorn (ek arab dollar se adhik vailuation vaale) start ap logon ke shopping upbhog par aadhaarit hai
 The impetus to spend has also been limited due to uncertainty arising from demonetisation
 jab tak nakadi kii aapurti saamaanya nahin hoti or asamanjas khatm nahin hota, upbhog kharch ke lautne kii gunjaaish kam he
 This is the reason that the biggest loss of employment has been in start ups where jobs were seen in the last two years
 3
 Jan Dhanjan Dhan Yojana is an unexpected victim of demonetisation
 jaddojahad ke baad banking kii mukhya dhara main aae saikadon log ab iskar or jaanch agenciyon ke nishane par hai
 It will be difficult to re-establish their faith in banking
 financial inklusen kii uljhan sirf yaheen khatm nahin hoti
 Banking in India is basically deposit focused
 notebandike baad bainkon main diposit kaa ambara he or karj sasta karne ke liye bank jamaa kii dar gata rahe hai
 The largest customers of banks, depositors, have to sacrifice their returns, which will reduce the attractiveness of deposits in banks
 padhein,neenv kaa nirmaan phir

 Veerappa Moily today said that there will be no change in the government's decision to increase gas prices
 sarkaar ne gharelu prakritik gas ke daam agle saal 1 april se badhaane kaa faisla kiya he
 The government has approved the formula suggested by the Rangarajan committee for fixing the price of gas, according to which the gas prices will be doubled from next year
 moili ne guuruuvaar ko kaha ‘sarkaar ke str par mantrimandal kii aarthik maamalon kii samiti (sisiie) ke faisle kii samiksha athwa punarvichaar ke bare main koi sochvichaar nahin chal rahaa he
 There is no confusion or uncertainty about this here
 or mujhe nahin lagata ki yahaan koi or vyakhya kiye jane kii gunjaaish he
 The government's decision to increase the gas price has been controversial from the beginning
 sisiie kii baithak main 27 june ko jab se yah nirnay liya gaya tabhi se is baat ko lekar sarkaar kii aalochana ho rahi he ki daam badhaane kaa faisla mukesh ambani kii company reliance industries ko phayda pahunchane ke liye kiya gaya he
 Moily said his ministry had twice sought his views from the finance ministry and these were included in the CCEA note
 vitt mantralay ne apni tippanee main gas ke daam kii seemaa tay karne yaa phir reliance ko puraane daam par gas bechney ke liye kehane jaisi koi baat nahin kahi
 Moily said 'I don't think it can be interpreted any more
 yah nirnay kaaphi soch vichaar ke baad liya gaya or meraa maananaa he ki isamen kaaphi samay liya gaya
 Once the decision is taken, we will stick to it
 ’gas ke daam main hone vaali vruddhi ko simit kiye jane kii sambhaavna ko darkinar karte huye moili ne kaha ‘sisiie kaa faisla barkaraar he
 There is no change in it
 or keval petroleum evam prakritik gas mantralay hi nahin, sarkaar main bhi isamen badlaav par koi vichaar nahin ho rahaa he
 'moily said' CCEA prices domestic gas
 rangarajan samiti dwaara sujhaaye gayi formule ke aadhaar par tay karne sambandhi prastaav ko manjuuri di he
 According to this formula, the fixed price will be equally applicable to all domestic produced gas and all consumer sectors
 ’formule ke anusaar prayek timahi gas ke daam kii samiksha hogi
 Given the rising price of gas in the international market, there has been a concern that if gas pricing is left open, the price of gas in the country will soon reach 10 to 12 dollars
 nayaa gas formula paanch saal tak prabhavi rahegaa

 noida thana, sector -49 kshetra ke sector - 115 sthit madrase main ek hi parivaar kii do maasoom bacchion ko madrase ke maulavee dwaara belt se buree tarah peetane kaa maamla saamne aayaa he
 The parents of the victim girls complained about this to the concerned police station
 shikaayat par police ne praathmiki darj kar jaanch shuru kar di he
 Police are talking about the absconding of the accused while the accused has apologized to the team till date, acknowledging their mistake
 peedit paksh kaa aarope he ki police ne madrase ke maulavee ko hiraasat main lekar chhod diya he
 Family members say that the police are reluctant to arrest the accused
 peedit bacchon ke sharir par dikh rahe laal nishaanon ko dekhakar aap swayan andaja laga sakate hai ki in masuumon ko kis berahami se peeta gaya hai
 When Aaj Tak's team asked the victim girls about this, they told that the cleric of the madrasa had asked to speak some words
 sahi tareeke se na bol paane ke kaaran madrase ke maulavee ne belt se buree tarah peeta
 While talking to the father of the victim girls about this, he told that two months ago, both the girls were admitted to the madrasa located in Sector-115, Noida, for training
 donon bacchiyaan vahiin rahakar talim hasil kar raheen thim
 The fathers of the girls used to meet their girls at the interval of ten to fifteen days and bring them to the house for two days
 usee kram main chaar may ko pita apni bacchiyon ko lene ke liye gaya or unhen lekar aayaa
 She had bruises on her back when the mother of the girls removed her clothes to bathe
 bacchiyon ne poochne par bataaya kii unhen madrase ke maulavee ne belt se peeta he
 The father said that when he went to talk to the cleric of the madrasa about this, the accused maulvi then escaped from there
 bacchiyon ke pita ne kaha, 'maine maulavee ke pita se mulaakaat kii jinhone apane anya saathiyon ke saath mujhase abhadrata kii or marpet par utaaru ho gaye
 In view of the situation, i called the dial 100 number, then on information the police came and took the father of the accused maulvi
 meri shikaayat par police ne exiaar bhi darj kar lee lekin subah aaropee ke pita ko chhod diya
 Since then, the accused is absconding
 police koi aage kii karrwahee nahin kar rahi he
 There is a demand from our government that the accused should be punished
 'ajtak' ke samvaadadaata ne madrase pahunchakar jab aropit maulavee se baat kii to unhone apni galati ko kabool karte hue kaha, 'haa mujhase galati hui he
 i accept my mistake
 lekin meraa gussa kisi dwesh bhaavana ke chalate nahin tha
 Since i could not remember even after telling these girls many times, i got angry
 jiske chalate mujhase yah galati hui he
 For this i have apologized in every way and i am ready to ask for it also
 bhavishya main aisi galati nahin karuunga
 The police officer says that in the ongoing madrasa in Noida Sector-115, the beating of two innocent girls with the belt was told by the family of the victimized girls
 shikaayat par maamla panjikrut kar liya gaya he
 The accused is still absconding and is being searched
 jahaan ek taraf police aaropee ke faraar hone kii baat kar rahi he vahi ajtak kii team ne use khoj nikaala or uskaa paksh jaanane ke liye usase baat kii
 This clearly shows that due to the negligence of the police, the accused is out of the custody of the police

 gujarat main 13 janvari 2003 ko hue ek anya encounter ko sibiai kathith rup se apni jaanch main farji bataa rahi he
 Sources are telling that it is coming out in the CBI investigation that in this case, the police not only committed a fake encounter but the IB also supported him in this conspiracy of the police
 sibiai ne apni jaanch main chah ibi ke adhikariyon se poochtacha kii he
 And now the CBI is saying that a different story is coming out in the interrogation
 sibiai ke sutron ke anusaar sadik ke bare main ibi ko teen jagahon se report mili thi
 The first report came from Mumbai's Gururaj Savadatti station in October 2002, followed by the second report from IB headquarters on November 24 of the same year, and then the final report from the Eye Department of Ahmedabad where Rajindra Kumar was posted
 yah vahi, rajindra kumah hai jinpar ishrat jahaan farji encounter maamle main ungali uth rahi hai
 The current investigation report of the CBI says that the character of the IB report about Sadiq does not match
 sadik ke grihnagar bhavnagar main 1996 main ek jhagade kaa maamla darj he or doosraa november 2002 main juen ke maamla darj hua tha
 He was granted bail in this case
 ibi kii tamaam reporton ke baad mumbai police ne 19 disambar 2002 ko hiraasat main liya or ibi ne ek hafte tak usase poochtacha kii
 The Mumbai department's IB chief Abandi Gopinathan has told the CBI that he did not find anything special during the interrogation of Sadiq
 'poochtacha main mumbai ke ibi vibhaag ne paaya ki sadik ke bare main jo bhi praarambhik soochna (viviipi par hamale ke sambandh main) thi satyapit nahin ho rahi thi'
 According to sources, Gopinathan told the CBI that Sadiq was sent to IB headquarters in Delhi for a clean chit
 baavjood iske 3 janvari 2013 ko sadik ko ahmedabad ke kim branch ko saunp diya gaya tha
 The story after this is even more confusing
 jabaki mumbai ibi se sadik ko clinit de di gai thi or 6 janvari ko gujarat ko saunp diya gaya
 At the same time, Rajindra Kumar said in a report that Sadiq has not been caught yet and efforts are on to find him
 iske baad ibi ke pashchimi vibhaag ke vishesh nideshak ne kaha ki use khojane ke prayaas jari rakhe jaaen
 The comments vahiin, 13 janvari 2003 ko sadik ke encounter kii khabar ai
 The police claimed at the time that Sadiq was a terrorist and wanted to kill Praveen Bhai Togadia, leader of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad besides Modi
 sadik ke bhai sabir ne is maamle main ibi ke tatkaaleen sanyukt nideshak rajindra kumaar, rajya ke purv griharajya mantri amit shah or mukhyamantri modi kii bhoomika kii jaanch kii maang kii he jiske baad court ne maamle kii jaanch sibiai ko saunp di thi
 The CBI has questioned six IB officials in its investigation
 or ab sibiai kah rahi he ki poochtacha main kuch alag hi kahani nikalakar saamne aa rahi he
 According to CBI sources, the IB had received reports about Sadiq from three places
 pehali report mumbai ke gururaj saavadatti stesan se oktober 2002 main ai, iske baad duusari report ibi mukhyalay se usee varsh 24 november ko mili or phir antim report ahmedabad ke ai vibhaag se mili jahaan par rajindra kumaar tainaat the

 a quarrel case was registered in Sadiq's hometown Bhavnagar in 1996 and a second gambling case was registered in November 2002

 After all the reports of the IB, Mumbai police detained on 19 December 2002 and the IB interrogated him for a week
 mumbai vibhaag ke ibi pramukh abandi gopinathan sibiai ko bataaya he ki sadik se poochtacha main unhen kuch bhi khaas nahin mila
 'in interrogation, Mumbai's IB department found that whatever preliminary information (regarding the attack on VVIP) about Sadiq was not being verified'
 sutron ke anusaar gopinathan ne sibiai ko bataaya ki sadik ko clinit kii dilli main ibi mukhyalay ko bhej di gai thi
 Despite this, Sadiq was handed over to the Kaim Branch in Ahmedabad on 3 January 2013
 iske baad kii kahani or bhi bhraamak he
 While Sadiq was given a clean chit from Mumbai IB and handed over to Gujarat on 6 January
 vahiin, rajindra kumaar ne ek report main kaha ki sadik ko abhi pakadaa nahin gaya he or use talashne ke prayaas jari hai
 Subsequently, the Special Director of the Western Department of IB said that efforts should be made to find him

 - taran adarsh (@taran_adarsh) July 4, 2019 Talk about the records of the film, so this year Kabir Singh has broken the records of many films
 yah saal 2019 kii pehali aisi film he jisane sabase teji se 200 karod kaa benchmark hasil kiya he
 In this case, Kabir Singh has also left Salman Khan's India behind
 bharat ko 200 karod kii kamai ke liye 14 din lage the jabaki kabir singh ne 13 din main yah aankada chhu liya
 There was a lot of criticism about the film as well
 lekin darshakon ne film ko saraahaa or isi kaa nateeja he ki kabir singh ab tak theatres par tiki hui he
 Let me tell you that Kabir Singh is a remake of the Telugu film Arjun Reddy
 yah arjuna reddy ke nirdeshak sandip wanga ke nirdesan main hi banaai gai he
 "will you leave the farm and work? Leaving the village and going to the city?" When Kalyani asked her husband this question, the eyes of the audience sitting in the auditorium of the IIT were deceived

 rashtriya natya vidhyalay main jari sarkari naatakon ke theatre olympic ke bich antaraal naatak samaaroh ke manchan ne samaaj or sarkaar kii haalat par shashakt saanskrithik hastkshep kiya he
 Akbar and Azam Qadri's drama 'mausam ko na jane kya ho gaya' shocked the audience on the last day of the two-day gap drama festival

 In the midst of ever-increasing debt and weather-threatening crops, the youth of the village start going to Delhi in search of work

 He believes that there is nothing more pleasant in the world than to feed people
 lekin tabhi fasal maari jaati he or betaa shahar nikal jaataa he
 Nawazuddin said - i did not deserve the family, i made a mistake
 
 
 shahar se paisa kamakar betaa gaanv lautataa he or sari bachat kheti main laga detaa he
 After this, the vicious cycle begins in which every farmer in India is feeling trapped today
 fasal phir maari jaati he, beti kii shaadi tut jaati he or soodakhor daravaaje par jamaa ho jate hai
 From here the play raises many questions
 kalyani puuchhati he ki mard to tab bhi niraash hokar jaan de sakate hai, lekin auraten kahaan jaaen? or us samay sabhaagaar se sisakiyon se gunj uthati he jab chaaron taraf se hataash kalyani aatmahatya ke liye faansee kaa fanda gale main daalati he
 Famous litterateur Maitreyi Pushpa, who arrived to inaugurate the interlude drama, said that the play is an important statement of its time
 unhone kaha naatak ke lekhak ajam kadri or nirdeshak akbar kadri ko badhai dete hue abhivyakti ke khataron ko lekar aagaah bhi kiya
 Azam Qadri said that the play which does not underline the politics of its time, has no meaning in staging
 vahiin akbar kadri ne ummid jaahir kii ki aise naatakon se mahanagaron ke darshak kisaanon ko lekar zyada samvedansheel honge

 bas jagah duusari thi
 Amit Shah went to address the Gaurav rally in Jind, Haryana on Sunday
 vahaan sabha main maujuud kuch logon ne bijepi adhyaksh ko kaale jhande dikhaae or sarkaar virdohi naare lagaae
 At the time when all this was happening, apart from Amit Shah, all the big leaders including state CM Manohar Lal Khattar, Union Minister Birendra Singh were present on the stage
 pradarshnkaree junior basic teacher the, jo pichley teen maheene se apni naukari pakki karne kii maang ko lekar hadtaal kar rahe hai
 When there was an uproar in Shah's meeting in Surat, there was a ruckus in Amit Shah's meeting in Surat on Thursday as well
 samaaroh main kursiyaan phenki gayi or patidaar amaanat andolan samiti ke netaa hardik patel ke samarthan main naare bhi lage
 This uproar happened at the time when apart from Shah, CM Vijay Rupani, former CM Anandiben Patel and all the big leaders were present on the stage
 polisbal kii bhi baari maujuudagi thi
 But the commotion was not controlled and the program lasting four hours had to be finished in an hour
 aise main hafte bhar ke bhitarabijepi adhyakshaki sabha main duusari baar aisi ghatana party ke liye achche sanket nahin hai
 If it is good for the party, then of course it should be given and credited to the party president, but if something goes wrong, the party president should be held responsible for it
 gujarat main bijepi adhyaksh kii sabha main kursiyaan phenki gayi, to haryana main kaale jhande dikhaae gaye
 Gujarat has had a BJP government for nearly two decades, while two years ago Haryana has a BJP government for the first time
 lekin in donon rajyon main sattadhari party main sabakuch thik nahin chal rahaa
 Jats on the one hand, on the other hand, in the assembly elections held in Haryana two years ago, the BJP got the mandate to form the government and the saffron party formed the government for the first time in the state
 lekin bijepi alaakaman ke siem chunane ke faisle ko lekar rajya main upja asantosh ab tak thama nahin he
 When Khattar was made the Chief Minister of Haryana, for the first time in the state, a Punjabi and after 18 years a non-jat was given the Chief Minister's chair
 rajya main yaheen se jat banaam gaiyr jat kii bahes bhi tej ho gai
 The same situation is with Gujarat
 oktober 2001 main siem kii kursi keshubhai patel se narendra modi ko saunpi gai thi
 In 2014, Anandiben Patel was given power to become Modi's PM
 haal main patel se kursi lekar vijay roopani ko saunpi gai
 When Rupani was sworn in as CM, nine cabinet ministers in his cabinet who were considered loyal to Anandiben Patel were discharged
 aarakshan ke liye andolnaharyana main vaise to aarakshan kii maang ko lekar jat samudaay pehle bhi andolan kar chukaa he
 But after the formation of the Khattar government, the gap between Jat and non-jat communities in the state has deepened
 jat samudaay yahaan beete farvari or june main hinsak pradarshan kar chukaa he
 The situation is the same in Gujarat
 rajya main aarakshan kii maang ko lekar patel samudaaypatidaar amaanat andolan samitike binar tale pichley saal pradarshan karne utraa
 This organization is demanding 27 percent reservation in government jobs and education along with the grant of OBC status to the Patel community
 siem kii kursihariyaan main bijepi kii sarkaar bani to party alaakaman ne siem ke taur manohar laal khatter ko pesh kiya

 isse sthaneey bijepi ke netaaon main asantosh kii lahar faili jo varshon se soobe main party kii neenv majboot karne main jute the
 When bjp's infighting surfaced In the last days, when the power of Gujarat was handed over from Anandiben to Vijay Rupani, the infighting of the party was exposed
 vidhayak dal kii baithak main anandiben ne roopani ke naam par vito laga diya
 She wanted to hand over the CM chair to Nitin Patel
 haalanki, piem modi kii dakhal ke baad anandiben jhukin or roopani ko netaa chunaa gaya
 Lack of leadership, lack of leadership in the team There have been reports of dissatisfaction with CM Khattar in Haryana
 beete farvari main to bijepi ke 100 netaaon ne khatter sarkaar ke khilaaf baghawat kaa bigul phunkate hue istipha de diya tha
 These Jats were angry with the action of the police-administration during the reservation movement
 beete farvari main rajya ke kaddavar netaa or khel mantri anil vij kii apane mahakme main siem ke dakhal se naaraazgi saamne ai thi
 In February itself, differences had also emerged between Vij and Khattar over compensation for the dead of the Jat movement
 badhane lagi he congress kii lokapriyatagujrat membhi koi aisa nahin, jisaki leadership modi jaisi he
 When Narendra Modi was the CM of Gujarat, there was no news of any tussle between the party and the government, but as soon as he went to Delhi everything started to get scattered and the popularity of the rival Congress in the state has started increasing
 doordarshita kaa abhaavgujrat ho yaa haryana, yahaan kii maujuuda sarkarein paristhitiyon kaa samay rahete sahi akalan nahin kar paa rahi hai
 Although Gujarat and Haryana are the leading states in the scale of development, but the caste factor is equally dominant in these states and governments cannot rule by ignoring it
 haryana main jaaton kaa virodhharyana main chaahe jat aarakshan kaa masalaa ho yaa soobe main kanoon-vyavastha kaa masalaa, khatter sarkaar har morch main naakaam sabit hui he
 CM Khattar has failed to practice Jats in the state
 jaaton ke aarakshan ko lekar is saal do baar hinsak andolan ho chuke hai
 The violence erupted with the Jat reservation movement has also seen a deep gap in the society
 yahaan gaiyr jat logon ne jaaton kaa virodh karnaa shuru kar diya he
 Patidar community angry in Gujarat; People in Patel community who created uproar at Surat's meeting are being told that they are angry with the ruling BJP of the state
 patidaar samudaay gujarat main bada vot bank he or rajya kii satta main apni upeksha se naaraaz he
 Last year, there were demonstrations in Gujarat on the call of Hardik Patel, then the state government showed great rigor in dealing with them
 hardik ko jail main daal diya gaya or saikadon pradarshnakariyon ko giraftaar kiya gaya
 More than a hundred Patel youths who created uproar in the Surat meeting were first detained and then released
 ‘panama papers’ prakaran main shuukravaar ko spain ke udyog mantri ne istipha de diya
 They have been accused of having links with foreign companies
 mantri jose minial psoria ne kaha ki beete kuch dinon main vyavsaayik kriyakalapon ko lekar unke spashtikaran ke sambandh main hui kai galatiyon ke silsile main or is sthiti se spain kii sarkaar ko hue nuksaan par vichaar karte hue unhone istipha diya he
 Soria's crisis began on Monday when the Spanish online newspaper 'il Confidential', which obtained leaked papers of 'panama Papers', said he was the administrator of a foreign firm in 1992
 tippaniyan Soria had denied having any ties to the company by calling a press conference but over time and alleged links with foreign companies were revealed by media institutions
 philhal yah spasht nahin hua he ki unki koi bhi kathith kaarywahi avaidh thi yaa nahin
 (this news has not been edited by the NDTV team
 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he) Minister Jose Manuel Soria said that he has resigned over the past few days in connection with his many mistakes regarding his explanations for business activities and considering the loss to the Spanish government from this situation

 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he) a surprising case has emerged from Madhya Pradesh
 australia ke edilade main agle maheene yojit hone ja rahe 'pacific skool games' main hissaa lene ke liye madhya pradesh ke skulon se vibhinn khelon ke liye 29 vidhyaarthiyon ko chunaa jaataa he
 These students are given just 3 days to complete the documents including passport
 phir 20 din baad australia jane vaale dal kii final list jari kii jaati he
 Now the names of only 19 students selected instead of 29 in this list remain
 is list main jo jhatka dene vaali baat saamne aati he, wo ye ki isamen bhartiya dal ke pramukh ke taur par madhya pradesh ke schuli shiksha mantri vijay shah kaa naam aa jaataa he
 Along with Shah, the names of 5 officers of Madhya Pradesh are also added to the list as members of the Indian party
 in sabhi ke naam un vidhyaarthiyon ke sthaan par list main jode gaye jo die gaye vakt main passport samet aavashyak kagajaat jamaa nahin kara paae
 The Public Instructions Directorate (directorate of Public Instruction) on 31 October 2017 had listed 29 students selected from schools to participate in basketball, football, hockey, netball, softball, swimming, diving and track-field events etc
 
 chune gaye vidhyaarthiyon ko sirf 3 din main passport samet aavashyak kagajaat jamaa karaane ke liye kaha gaya
 Surprisingly, the School Games Federation of India, headquartered in Agra, releases a final list on 20 November which records the names of people moving from Madhya Pradesh to Australia
 is final list main pehle chune gaye 29 vidhyaarthiyon main se sirf 19 ke naam hi bache rah jate hai
 The remaining names were removed because they were unable to submit the necessary documents including passports on time
 jinke naam list se hataae gaye unamembhopalki do sagi bahanen aashaa or anjali bhi shaamil hai
 Both sisters attend the MLB School in Bhopal
 donon ne paanch saal pehle softball khelnaa shuru kiya or is khel main rashtriya str par kai medal apane naam kiye
 For both sisters, having a selection for 'pacific School Games' was nothing short of a big dream
 donon ke paas passport nahin the or sirf teen din main sabhi aupchaariktaayen puri kar kagajaat jamaa kar dena unke liye sambhav nahin ho paaya
 In the final list released by the School Games Federation of India on 20 November, Madhya Pradesh's School Education Minister Vijay Shah and 5 state officials were named as official members of the team as the heads of the Indian contingent
 madhya pradesh schuli shiksha vibhaag dal ke har sadsy par dhai lakh rupee kharch kar rahaa he
 Let us tell that none of these officials of Madhya Pradesh going to Australia is the coach of any sports nor has any association with sports discipline
 haalanki jab mantri vijay shah se is bare main sampark kiya gaya to unhone kuch bhi galat hone se inkaar kiya
 Shah also presented the letter of the School Games Federation of India in his defense
 shah ne kaha ki unhen australia jane vaale 180 sadasyeey bhartiya dal kii aguai karne ke liye chunaa gaya
 When Vijay Shah was contacted about this, he said that he did nothing wrong
 shah ne apane bachaav main esefai kii ore se likhi chitthee ko pesh kiya
 Shah claims that he was elected to lead a contingent of 180 Indian participants selected by the Federation
 iske liye unhone apane lambey anubhav kaa hawala diya
 The letter that Shah mentioned was written on 17 November
 hairaani kii baat he ki iske do din baad hi 20 november ko australia jane vaale madhya pradesh ke vidhyaarthiyon or adhikariyon kii final list jari kii gai
 Surprisingly, this letter was written to Shah on 17 November by the Federation
 do din baad 20 november ko chune gaye khilaadiyon or saath jane vaale adhikariyon ke naamon kii suchi jari kii gai
 Here the question arises how the minister and other officials have completed and submitted all their papers in just two days
 list ke saath jo note tha wo bhi gaur karne laayak he
 It was written on this note that the following players and officials, who have submitted their papers, have been successfully registered, now it is neither possible nor in our hands to add more members
 vipakshi dal congress ne is prakaran ko sarkaar kii phixd praathamiktaaon kaa maamla bataaya he
 Leader of the Opposition Ajay Singh said that this is very unfortunate
 ye sarkaar kii praathamiktaaon ko darshata he
 The minister was not named before and suddenly he becomes the head of the party
 chune gaye vidhyaarthiyon kaa naam list se hataa diya jaataa he
 However, the biggest question here is that when the final list was released after 20 days, why were the selected students given only three days to complete all the paperwork including passports? While the letter was sent to the minister on 17 November and the final list released on 20 November, the names of the minister and five officials were recorded after all the formalities were completed

 After reading her thoughts about sex toys on Kara's blog, several companies talked to her and she became famous in this way
 kaara kaa kahana he ki wo jaanati hai ki koun sa sex toy istemaal main sarvottam he or koun sa sabase sasta padegaa

 Bouncers have been fiercely debated in the cricket world since the death of Australian batsman Phillip Hughes, but veterans believe that banning bouncers is a injustice to bowlers
 purv bhartiya ballebaaj tathaa team india ke coach rah chuke anshuman gaekwad khud bhi isi tarah kii bounsar gend lagane se cricket pich par maut ke kareeb se guzar chuke hai
 During the West Indies tour in 1976, Michael Holding was hit to his left ear on the Sabina Park ground, and had to stay in the ICU for two days
 unke kaan ke parde fat gaye the, or unhen aaj bhi kam sunai detaa he, lekin iske baavjood anshuman gaekwad bounsar par bain ke khilaaf hai
 He says, "we didn't even wear helmets in those days
 
 
 agar ek inch bhi idhar yaa udhar gend lagati to aaj main zindaa na hota
 
 
 Playing a bouncer is the biggest challenge for batsmen
 
 
 jokhim har khel main hote hai
 
 
 (philip) What happened to Hughes is very sad, but we must understand that it was an unusual accident
 
 
 bounsar par pabandi nahin lagani chahie
 
 
 " bhartiya team ke purv spin gendbaaj irapalli prasanna ke anusaar, desh ke sarvaadhik sammanit ballebaajon main shumaar kiye jane vaale sunil gavaskar se zyada to kisi bhi ballebaaz ne west indies kii khatarnaak pes bydaree kaa saamana nahin kiya hoga
 Gavaskar's success was also attributed to his strong backfoot technique of playing bouncers
 gavaskar, vijay manjrekar, tathaa west indies ke diggaj ballebaajon vivian richards or gairi sobers jaise mahaan khilaadiyon ne bounsar ke khilaaf ek takanic viksit kar lee thi, or ye ballebaaj gend kii line se hi hat jate the, yaa zarurat mahasoos karne par hook shot laga diya karte the
 This technique was excellent
 haal ke kuch saalon main isisi ne cricket ko lokapriy banane ke liye jo bhi nae niyam banaae hai, ve ballebaazon ke paksh main hai, so, purv bhartiya tej gendbaaz javagal shrinath kaa kahana he ki aise maahaul main bounsar ko bhi hataa dene se gendbaazi bilkul bemaani rah jaaegi
 He said, "removing the bouncer or reducing it from two to one in an over will upset the balance of the game
 
 
 bounsar ko hataane se maut ruk jaaegi, isaki bhi guarantee nahin
 
 
 Even if a fast shot of the batsman hits the bowler's head, his life can be in danger
 
 
 " It is noteworthy that former explosive opener Virender Sehwag has also expressed his opinion against the ban on bouncers
 ek samvaadadaata sammelan ke dauraan sahvaag ne kaha tha, short pich gendon se bachane kaa sabase acha tarika dak karnaa (jhuk janaa) he
 He said, "it is very regrettable that Philip Hughes died this way, but the injury is part of cricket
 
 
 aap bounsar kaa saamana karte hue dak kar sakate hai, lekin agar bounsar hataa die jaaenge, to khel main mazaa hi nahin rahegaa
 
 
 i have also been hit on the helmet, but cricket is a batsman's game anyway, so bouncers are a good weapon for bowlers
 
 
 " So, a true tribute to Phil Hughes may be to focus on improving safety equipment rather than considering banning bouncer balls

 SP President Akhilesh Yadav, who had a soft stance for the Congress in the initial phase of Lok Sabha elections, has tightened his attitude by the fifth phase
 congress or bijepi donon partiyon ko akhilesh ek hi sikke ke do pahalu bataa rahe hai
 Akhilesh says that Congress is more responsible for the CBI investigation going on against him today than BJP
 sibiai ko lekar congress-bijepi donon ne jugalbandi kar rakhi he or donon partiyaan ne sibiai se gathbandhan kar rakhaa he
 Akhilesh Yadav said in a special conversation with Aaj Tak's team that the PIL, which is being tried in the Supreme Court against him and his family members, has been filed by no one but the Congress leader
 akhilesh yadav jab bhi congress ko nishane par lete hai to unke target par ek hi shaks hota he
 However, the SP President has not named that person
 aise main ham bataate hai ki us congress netaa kaa naam vishwanath chaturvedi he, jiske chalate akhilesh yadav or unke parivaar par sibiai jaanch chal rahi he
 Vishwanath Chaturvedi is a lawyer in the Supreme Court and has filed a PIL against the Mulayam family for a disproportionate assets case for the last 17 years
 chaturvedi kii yachika par hi mulaayam parivaar jaanch ke ghere main he
 Explain that in March 2007, on the PIL of Chaturvedi, the Supreme Court ordered the CBI to investigate the properties of Mulayam, Akhilesh and wife Dimple and brother Prateek Yadav
 iske alaava vishwanath chaturvedi ne lakhanu land scam or khadyaan maamle main bhi yachika laga rakhi he
 Vishwanath Chaturvedi said in conversation with Aaj Tak that if the Congress party was so bad then why has the SP supported the UPA for 10 years
 akhilesh yadav itane bhole aadmi to hai nahin ki jis congress ne aapke khilaaf mukadmaa kar rakhaa he, uske saath kaise the
 In such a situation what was your helplessness
 mulaayam singh yadav narendra modi ko phir se pradhanmantri banane kii kaamana kar rahe hai
 They remained the hangers of the ruling party to avoid the CBI going to jail
 chaturvedi ne aarope lagaaya he ki sapa ne rajnath singh or narendra modi ke khilaaf dami candidet ko utaara he
 It is clear that these people are increasing drinking from BJP
 chaturvedi ne kaha, 'maine to rajnath singh ke khilaaf haidargarh seat se chunaav ladaa he
 BJP removed our security
 main avadh kaa aadmi hum or sajhi viraasat main vishwaas karata hum
 In such a situation, the allegations that are being made against us are baseless
 'bataa den ki vishwanath chaturvedi kaa janm raibareli ke shivgarh main hua or padhai-likhaai lakhanu kekisi college main hui
 During this time, he entered politics through NSUI and carried forward his politics through the path of the Youth Congress

 aise main unke liye barabanki kii haidargarh seat se puttu avasthi ne vidhansabha sadsyta se istipha de diya
 Vishwanath Chaturvedi was in front of the Congress when Rajnath Singh contested from Haidergarh seat
 isi chunaav ke baad chaturvedi ne mulaayam kunbe ke khilaaf aay se adhik sampatti ko lekar janhit yaachik daayar kii thi
 Recently, Archarya Pramod Krishnam of Congress, from Lucknow parliamentary seat, came to the election ground, Vishwanath Chaturvedi was seen standing shoulder to shoulder
 pramod krishnam namakan patr ke daakhil karne ke dauraan bhi saath main the
 This is what Akhilesh Yadav has mentioned
 chaturvedi ne kaha ki ek din ke liye lakhanu gaya or usee din se akhilesh yadav hataasha or baukhalaahat main najar aa rahe hai
 The more interesting it is, the more bad luck

 Former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Farooq Abdullah and his son Omar Abdullah have differed opinions on the Congress getting the leadership of the opposition unity in the upcoming election to oust the BJP from power at the Center
 umr kaa maananaa he ki 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaavon ke prachaar abhiyaan main congress ko vipakshi ekta kii dhuree bananaa chahie or saath hi vah is baat kii vakaatal karte hai ki rahul gandhi ko isaki aguwai kerani hogi
 On the other hand, Omar's father Farooq Abdullah believes that the grand alliance will not be able to take shape under the leadership of the Congress
 ajtak ke sidhi baat kaarykram main shanivaar ko faruk abdulla se jab 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ke saamne congress ke netritv vaali vipakshi ekajutata par sawaal kiya gaya to unhone aisi sambhaavnaaon se inkaar kiya
 He said, 'I do not think there can be an alliance under the leadership of the Congress
 'sidhi baat: faruk abdulla bole- gathbandhan kii captain nahin hogi congress, banegaa third frontcongress jis mahagathbandhan ke purajor prayaas main lagi he, uske swaroop par bhale hi faruk abdulla ko andeshaa ke badal chhaae najar aa rahe hon, lekin unhen lagata he ki bijepi ke virdohi dalon kaa ek third front jarur ban saktaa he
 Which can be a problem for the Modi government and can hurt the bjp's hopes of returning to power
 vahiin faruk abdulla ke ulat unke putr or jammu kashmir ke purv siem umr abdulla ne kaha he ki centre main bijepi ko satta se hataane ke liye 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaavon ke prachaar abhiyaan main congress ko vipakshi ekta kii 'dhuree' or iske pramukh rahul gandhi ko iskaa aguva bananaa hoga
 In an interview with news agency 'PTI', Abdullah said, although the responsibility of strong regional leaders in their states is no less
 unhone kaha, 'congress ko dhuree bananaa padegaa kyonki ek vishesh party se vipaksh kii siton kaa hissaa isi se hoga kyonki kai aise rajya hai jahaan par congress or bijepi ke bich sidhi takkar hogi
 'advocacy of bringing the Congress to the Center, Omar said,' After all, to form a government at the center, you will need 272 seats which regional parties are not going to get
 yadi gaiyr-bijepi sarkaar banane ke liye is aankade tak nahin pahunchate hai to aap 100 siton ke kareeb hone ke kaaran congress kii taraf dekhenge
 Abdullah met West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee here on Friday and held talks on a possible opposition front
 vipakshi morcha banane ke liye prayaas teji se kiye ja rahe hai, lekin kshetreey dalon ke netaaon kaa ek varg nahin chahta he ki congress isaki aguwai kare or ve ek gaiyr-bijepi evam gaiyr-congress morcha banane kii baat kar rahe hai
 On the issue of making Rahul Gandhi the face of the opposition, Abdullah said that as the president of the largest opposition party, he is hopeful that he will lead the election campaign
 unhone kaha, 'nishchit rup se, har koi ummid karegaa kii rahul gandhi 2019 main chunaav abhiyaan main aguwai kare lekin yaad rakhana hoga ki sonia gandhi upie kii netaa hai
 So one would expect Sonia Gandhi to be a part of the campaign as well
 'rahul par isliye he bharosarahul gandhi kii netritv kshamta par sawaal uthaane waalon par nishaanaa sadhate hue abdulla ne karnataka main sarkaar banane kii congress kii bhoomika par unka udhaaharan diya or kaha ki unhone kaaphi paripakvata dikhaai he ki party kaa aadhaar kaise badhanaa he
 Abdullah said, 'he is the president of the Congress party
 agar kisi ko unke netritv ke gun par andeh hona chahie to yah unki party ko hona chahie
 His party has no problem with this, then why should anyone else object

 The court, while hearing a petition by the Islamic Relief Committee of Gujarat (IRCG), said that lack of action, lack of action and negligence on the part of the state government to stop the riots resulted in widespread damage to religious places in the state
 adaalat ne kaha ki in sthanon main marammat or muaavje kii jimmedaari sarkaar kii he
 The court said that when the government paid compensation for the damage done to houses and commercial establishments, it should also compensate the religious places
 adaalat ne yah aadesh bhi diya ki pradesh ke 26 jilon ke mukhya nyaayadhish apane sambandhit jilon main dharmik sthanon ke liye muaavje ke aavednon ko praapt kar un par faisla karenge
 He has been asked to convey his decision to the High Court within six months

 sarkaar ne yah bhi kaha ki dangon ke dauraan kshatigrast hue dharmik sthalon ko behaal karne yaa marammat karne ke liye muaavje kii koi niti nahin he
 IRCG counsel MTM Hakim praised it as a historic verdict

 a fire broke out in session court on Monday morning
 vahiin der raat re road ilaake kii commercial shop main bheeshan aag lag gai
 Fire brigade teams at both places had to struggle for hours to extinguish the fire

 Where there was a fire? Recently there have been cases of fire in many places in Mumbai
 kamala milsacompound kaa mojos pub main aag lag gai

 Raghuram Rajan, former Governor of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), says that those in powerful positions should tolerate criticism, and warned in a blog that suppressing criticism would condition policy mistakes
 raghuram rajan (raghuram Rajan) ne yah bhi kaha he ki sirf aalochana hi vah rasta he, jisaki vajah se sarkaar sudharatmak nitigat kadam uthaati he
 Recalling the achievements of Nani Palkiwala, a well-known jurist and leading advocate of liberalism, the former RBI governor wrote, "every critic will be asked to retreat on the phone on behalf of a government official, or the troll army of the ruling party
 If targeted, many people will downplay their criticism, lighten it
 
 
 aise main sarkaar tab tak sab kuch acha-acha dikhne vaale maahaul main vakt bitaa sakegi, jab tak kadavi sachai ko sachmuch andekha nahin kiya ja sakegaa
 
 
 "he insisted that people in powerful positions in power must tolerate criticism
 raghuram rajan ne kaha, "nihsandeh, kuch aalochanaayen, jinamein media main kii ja rahi aalochanaayen bhi shaamil hai, galat jaankaree par aadhaarit hoti hai, khaas makasad se kii jaati hai, pad ke sthaan par vyakti ke khilaaf hoti hai
 
 
 It has certainly happened against me during previous jobs

 "raghuram Rajan, currently serving as Professor of Finance at the University of Chicago, said that constant criticism can lead to corrective policy steps
 unhone kaha, "jo sarkarein saarvajanik aalochana ke swar ko dabaa detii hai, vah apana hi baari nuksaan karti hai
 
 
 "in the backdrop of Raghuram Rajan's views, Modi's government is to be removed from the Prime Minister's Economic Advisory Council to Ratin Roy and Shamika Ravi, who were allegedly removed because they criticized the government's policies
" brookings india main doirector of research shamika ravi tathaa neshnal institute of public finance and policy ke nideshak ratin roy ne sovrain bondon (sovereign bonds) ke zariye videshi bazaaron se raashi jutaney ke sarkaar ke nirnay par sawaal khadey kiye the

 2012 main isi tarah ke sawaalon ke jariye rashtriya menuphaccharing policy taiyaar kii gai thi jo chuninda udyogon main china par nirbharta ghataane kii koshish thi
 This policy is the basis of 'make in India'
 'mek in india' ko narebaaji se nikaal kar un udyogon (telecom equipment, electronics, dawaaen, computer hardware) ko riyaayaten dene par kendrit karnaa hoga, jahaan ham china ke bina saans nahin le sakate

 Therefore, European and American companies will have to be called with special incentives and invest in the development of domestic technologies

 yuddh koi bhi ho, uski apni ek keemat hoti he
 The price that we will have to fight with China is: Foreign investment (non-sugar) and direct incentive to the industry ie budgetary expenditure, high deficit, concession and concessions means less revenue; Strict on imports from China; Reduction in supply means expensive rupee means expensive imports
 The overall change in economic policies, control of government spending, Sun Tzu said that the enemy is without war

 Congress General Secretary and Yuvraj Rahul Gandhi lashed out at the current and former Chief Ministers of UP Mayawati and Mulayam Singh Yadav
 rahul ne samaajawaadee party (sapa) pramukh mulaayam singh yadav ke ‘muslim prem’ par sawaal khadey kiye or bahujan samaaj party (basapa) kii adhyaksh mayawati par ‘upi shining’ ke mugalate main jeene kaa aarope lagaaya
 See detailed coverage on the UP elections, telling lies about the promises made by the SP and the BSP in their election manifesto, saying that the leaders of this party are ready to say everything the public wants to hear in the election fiddle
 upi main congress mahasachiv ne ambedkarnagar main yojit chunavi sabha main kaha, ‘mulaayam singh kehete hai ki congress ne musalamaanon ko kam aarakshan diya
 He himself was the Chief Minister of the state thrice but he did nothing in this direction at his level and when Rashid Masood talked about reservation, he was expelled from the party
 ’ muslim aarakshan ko lekar yadav ke vaade ko jhooth bataate hue rahul ne kaha, ‘mulaayam singh kehete hai ki vah 28 pratishat aarakshan denge
 The Supreme Court has said that this much reservation cannot be given but Mulayam is saying that he will give
 vah jhooth bolte hai
 He thinks that the public does not understand anything
 ’rahul ne kaha, ‘mulaayam singh bijli, pani or aarakshan dene kii baat kar rahe hai
 He thinks that the public will not understand anything
 vah vaade to karte hai magar jab janata ke haq ke liye ladane kii baat aati he to kuch nahin karte
 'rahul said,' Mulayam became the Chief Minister thrice
 hamane peedies kaa anaaj bheja
 His people scam him
 aapkaa bhojan chori kiya
 Accusing Mayawati of living in the mogulage of 'UP Shining', Rahul said that the Chief Minister's officers told her that she was ruling very well and Uttar Pradesh was shining
 rahul ne kaha, ‘ye bade-bade afasar netaaon kii ankhen band kar dete hai
 When Mayawati became the Chief Minister, her officials said that you are doing a very good job and you do not need to go to the villages and talk to laborers, farmers
 uttar pradesh chamak rahaa he
 'she said,' Mayawati also understood that Uttar Pradesh is shining and she forgot to go to the villages
 kya aapmen koi kami he jo vah aapke yahaan nahin jaatin
 'rahul said,' The biggest drawback in India is that your leaders do not go among you
 aapke gharon main, kisaanon, mahilaon or mazdooron se baat nahin karte
