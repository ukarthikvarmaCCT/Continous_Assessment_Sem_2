 There, the BJP is going to lay the foundation of a strong third front as compared to the AIADMK and DMK, while the announcement of its alliance with the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) in Andhra Pradesh is now just a formality
 pichley loksabhaa chunaav main andhra pradesh kii vajah se hi congress ne 200 kaa aankada paar kiya
 a powerful leader, met as YSR Reddy, played a big role in bringing this success to the Congress, but now things have changed
 wiesar kii mrityu ke baad unke bete jaganmohan congress se alag hokar apni party bana chuke hai
 Andhra Pradesh is divided
 2 june ko alag telugana or simandhra rajya astitv main aa jaaenge
 An alliance between the BJP and the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) is believed to be almost fixed
 kaha ja rahaa he ki simandhra main narendra modi kii 25 march ke aasapaas sambhavit raily ke dauraan donon hi partiyon main gathbandhan kii ghoshnaa kii ja sakati he
 During his visit to Hyderabad on March 11, party president Rajnath Singh and senior leader Arun Jaitley have also told state leaders that they should be ready for an alliance with TDP
 donon hi partiyon ke netaaon main siton ke bantwaare ke liye baatcheet chal rahi he
 The TDP hopes that by aligning with the BJP in both Telangana and Seemandhra, the votes that the BJP is getting in the name of Modi will be transferred
 jabaki bijepi ko lagata he ki tidipi ke vyapak jamini aadhaar or sanghathan kaa phayda lekar vah donon hisson ke kuch bade shaharon main chunavi kamyaabi hasil kar sakati he
 This will be considered a big success for BJP
 na sirf endie ko tidipi ke rup main ek majboot sahyogi dal milegaa, balki dakshin bharat main karnataka ke baad andhra pradesh main bhi use pair pasaarne kaa ek bada mauka phir milegaa
 The BJP won seven Lok Sabha seats in 1999 in alliance with TDP and got four per cent of the votes in the assembly
 jabaki 1998 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ne tidipi ke saath gathbandhan main chaar loksabhaa siten jiti thim
 The problem is that the way the BJP supported the Telangana bill in Parliament, there is an atmosphere against it in Seemandhra
 tidipi ko is baat kaa ehsaas he or isiilie abhi tak gathbandhan kaa elaan nahin ho sakaa he, balki bich main tidipi kii naaraazgi is had tak thi ki usne gathbandhan kii baatcheet bhi band kar di thi
 Efforts are being made that one-on-one rallies will be organized in Seemandhra by Narendra Modi and in these they assure that after the NDA government comes a special package will be given for Seemandhra
 bijepi iske liye taiyaar bhi he
 Like Ram Vilas Paswan, Chandrababu Naidu coming along will be very comforting for Narendra Modi personally
 paswan kii hi tarah chandrababu bhi apane muslim voton ko naaraaz nahin karnaa chaahate the
 Both leaders call themselves secular and have been with the Third Front
 chandrababu gaiyr congresavad ke naam par bijepi ke saath jude the
 But remained with the BJP even after the 2002 riots, as the party promised not to become a separate Telangana
 vaise atal bihari vaajapeyi ke samay bijepi ke paas dakshin bharat se tidipi ke alaava tamilnadu main piemke, emdmake, diemke yaa ediemke, karnataka main ramakrishna hegade jaise sahyogi rahe hai
 But by bringing out the contradiction between Vajpayee and Modi's image, it has always been said about Modi that BJP will not be able to get new allies to form the government
 magar pehle paswan or ab chandrababu naidu jaise netaaon se chunaav purv gathbandhan kar modi ne is myth ko todane kii koshish kii he
 Apparently in the hope that after seeing the elections, allies like Mamata Banerjee, Jayalalithaa or Naveen Patnaik will not be afraid to come together
 rahul gandhi ne shiksha or sarkari naukari se sambandhit do baaten kahi hai
 He said in Malda that villages and towns would repair the network of government colleges
 doosraa sarkaar main aane par march 2020 tak centre sarkaar ke khaali pade 20 lakh padon ko bhar denge
 i have been doing job series and university series for a year and a half
 kisi raajnneetik dal ne in muddon ko gambhirtha se nahin liya
 Everyone shores ab jab har survey main yah aa rahaa he ki noujvaan sabase adhik berojgaare ko praathamikta de rahaa he is par koi thos baat nahin ho rahi he
 These two promises of Rahul Gandhi make it seem that they watch prime time! BJP should also look
 duniya ke television ke itihaas main pehali baar prime time television par shiksha or naukari par itnaa lanbaa kawarez kiya hum
 Not a day, not a week, but several months
 50-60 episod uniwarsity par kiya, sarkari naukariyon par kai maheene tak prime time karata chalaa gaya
 He has written fifty articles on the Facebook page @ravishkapage
 koi bhi check kar saktaa he
 Let this history be shown by a TV match first
 rahul gandhi ke donon bayanon par bahes honi chahie
 Only then will the other parties in the competition give importance to government education and employment
 zyaada thos vaada karenge
 Rahul's promise has a deadline and a number
 modi kii tarah har saal do karod rojgaar dene kaa vaada kar daayen baayen karne kaa pattern nahin he
 They may be asked that 30 March 2020 is ending
 20 lakh main kitni naukariyaan deen
 Journalists and youngsters can also chase him through this deadline and number
 yah bhi poocha janaa chahie ki maujuuda pariksha vyavastha kii jo haalat he, wo khasta he
 It is not for him to conduct any examination at the appointed time
 aap thos tareeke se bataaiye ki kaise yah kaam karenge
 The leader of his own party is not promoting this announcement of Rahul
 shaayad unhen yakeen kam hoga
 Leaders like Chidambaram believe in it or not, but such a line will put Rahul against the corporate leaders of his own party
 do raajnneetik dalon ke bich main or har raajnneetik dal ke bheetar sangharsh ab inhen muddon par hona chahie
 Villages have cracked the colleges of towns
 iske liye congress kii sarkarein bhi zimmedaar rahi hai
 BJP and regional parties too
 bijepi ko teen pramukh rajyon main 15 saal sarkaar chalaane kaa mauka mila
 Till date no level educational institute could be established
 usne bhi kasbon or gaanvon ke sarkari collejon ko dhwast kaa he
 As a result, children of ordinary people were evicted from education
 clavity kii shiksha se dur kar die gaye
 The media did not leave it just because it had to shore up the opposition but also because today the media is also not honest about the education system
 pradhanmantri modi ne kalejon ke bare main paanch saal main kuch nahin kaha
 Just said that we will give 10,000 crore to bring ten universities in the top ten
 jo asal main fund diya use sunakar aap hansenge
 He formulated the policy of making expensive institutions
 ambani ke college ko manyata de di jo kagaz par hi tha
 You can search media in this regard and see media reports
 hamane bhi prime time main dikhaaya he or fasebuk pej par likhaa he
 BJP had a 5-year opportunity to fill these posts, but did not fill it
 saatven vetan ayog kii report main hi baat aa gai thi ki kin-kin vibhaagon main kitne pad khaali hai
 At the same time, the number of posts in the railway was to be reduced
 internet par he or maine apane blog pej 'kasbaa' main likhane se lekar prime time main kai baar is par bolaa he
 Last year is October news
 grahamantri ne kendriya balon or dilli police main khaali padon kii samiksha kii thi
 It turned out that 55,000 posts are vacant
 kaash aisi samiksha pehle hote or samay se bhare gaye hote taaki kai naujavaanon ko umr seemaa biit jane se pehle mauka mil jaataa
 The same situation was with the railway
 sansad main mantri hi bataa rahe the ki dhai lakh pad khaali hai
 But the idea of filling up came when the election came and the issue of unemployment went up and started speaking
 naujavaanon ko rahul gandhi or congress ko is par bolne ke liye majaboor karnaa chahie
 The more they speak, then only you will know what they are thinking to create a network of government colleges in the village towns and how they will fill 20 lakh posts within a year
 kahaan se eemaandaar pariksha vyavastha laaenge, kaise pariksha karenge ki riselt par kisi ko shaq na ho or mukademebaazi na ho
 Why does any examination take years to complete? Finance Minister Jaitley has told Dainik Bhaskar on April 1 that allegations of job loss are baseless
 pehle kaha tha ki agar naukariyaan nahin hotin to desh bhar main asantosh hota
 Today, the BPSC examiners are agitating in Bihar
 parikshaarthiyon ne patna ke ashok rajpath par march nikaala he
 Every day there is movement in some or the other state
 bengal main vahaan ke lok seva ayog ke baahar chaatro ne lanbaa dharna diya
 How many lathis did education friends eat in UP
 kitnon ne aatmahatya kar lee
 The teachers staged and ate sticks
 agar vitt mantri ko nahin dikhataa he to kya kiya ja saktaa he
 Messages are being circulated on the candidate message for recruitment of 69,000 teachers from UP
 narmalizeshan kii prakriya ke bare main na hamen samaj he or na hi parikshaarthi ko
 Their questions are not being satisfied
 vahi haal he
 41,520 candidates of UP Police are not being admitted
 jabaki parikshaarthiyon kaa aarope he ki mantri yahaan vahaan bol rahe hai ki naukari de di gai
 These 41000 candidates feel that joining will not happen if the election goes out
 sarkaron kaa jo ricard he use dekhakar inaki ashanka sahi he
 90 percent of these 41000 students would abuse me
 hindu muslim karte honge, phir bhi ye mujhi ko kehete hai ki aap likh den yaa dikhaa den
 But i see a deep crisis in it
 vyaktigat taur par inaki gaaliyon ko nahin letaa
 What mistake are they being punished for? inhone pariksha paas kii he to jwining honi chahie
 There is Magadha University in the same Bihar
 kanoonee pench ke kaaran is baar tisare varsh kaa riselt nahin aayaa
 The students got tired
 31 march kar railway kii pariksha kaa farm bharne kaa mauka chalaa gaya
 Students from Bihar University got a call
 teen saal kaa bie paanch saal main bhi puraa nahin hua he
 The students demonstrated, but only a hundred and fifty attended it
 baaki chaatr apana-apana dekho or raveesh kumaar yaa media ko messej kar ai pi el dekho kii niti par chalate rahe
 Due to this political quality of students it may be possible to fool them
 puri zindagi barbaad karne ke baad bhi unke bich vahi raajnneetik dal praasangik bane hue hai jinhone unki samasya suni tak nahin
 Students will have to fight for the education and examination system of Bihar or any state
 wo lard rahe hai magar wo paryaapt nahin he
 He does not have the moral force to change anything
 do lakh logon kaa jivan seshan let hone se barbaad ho gaya
 If the same two lakhs stood with their parents barefoot in the Gandhi Maidan, the government would have been forced to do something within a month
 media kawarej se thos badlaav nahin aayega
 i tried it
 dedh saal karne ke baad aaj netaa majaboor to hue hai baat karne ke liye magar kuch thos hota nahin dikh rahaa he
 There is no debate on this
 is chunaav kii safalataa tabhi hogi jab noujvaan shiksha or rojgaar ke sawaal par congress or bijepi ko majaboor kar de
 To think new and make concrete promises

 Can the Chief Secretary of a state send threatening messages to a senior IAS officer
 massej bhi aisa jise sunakar koi bhi hairaan rah jayega
 But this has happened in Haryana
 mukhya sachiv par duusare vibhaag ke sachiv ko dhamkee bhare massej bhejne ke aarope hai
 If the dispute escalated, the Public Relations Department of Haryana has issued that SMS of the Chief Secretary
 jisamen unhone khed jataayaa he
 Pradeep Kasani, secretary of Haryana's senior IAS and administrative reforms department, received several threatening and offensive language MSS on mobile on Monday morning
 haryana ke senior iees adhikari ko mili ek esemes kii bhashaa kuch aisi thi
 'good Night! Celebrate your new fame
 lekin agar apni maa kaa doodh piyaa he to mere saare massej press ko dikhaa dena
 'when threatened, Pradeep Kasani showed all the messages to the media
 gauratlab he ki pradeep kaasni ko ye saare massej soobe ke sabase varisht adhikari or haryana ke mukhya sachiv esaysi choudhary ne bheje hai
 After all, why did the Chief Secretary send a threatening SMS to another senior IAS
 maamla rhite tu sarvice kamishan or artiiai kamishan ko lekar he
 The Hooda government of Haryana made hasty appointments in both commissions, to which Pradeep Kasani objected
 jiske baad mukhya sachiv bifer gaye or pradeep kaasni ko dhamkee bhare esemes bhej die
 When the matter caught fire, the Chief Secretary gave the clarification, saying that such messages go on in friendship
 haalanki pradeep kaasni bhi maanate hai ki mukhya sachiv ke saath unke rishte behatar rahe hai or wo achche insaan hai
 But perhaps sending threatening and objectionable smses under pressure from the Chief Minister

 However, the opposition and social organizations have criticized the government for this
 makapa ne maang kii he ki kashmir ghati main saamaanya sthiti behaal karne ke liye pradhanmantri manmohan singh ko pahal kerani chahie or rajya ke vibhinn samoohon ke saath baatcheet kii prakriya shuru kii jaani chahie
 Party politburo member Sitaram Yechury said that the Prime Minister should call an all-party meeting to discuss the issue and form a consensus to resolve the issue
 yechuri ne makapa mukhyalay main samvaadadaata sammelan main aarope lagaaya ki daavon ke baavjood jammu kashmir main thos baatcheet prakriya kii shuruyaat nahin huyi, jabaki kai raashtra virdohi takatein rajya sarkaar ko asthir karne kaa prayaas kar rahi hai

 Yechury said, "the Prime Minister made many promises to Kashmiri youth including economic security and employment, but those promises were not fulfilled
" isse yuvaaon main asantosh paidaa hua or jisaki parinti maujuuda sthiti he
 The CPI (M) leader said, "foreign Secretary-level talks to normalize relations between the two countries did not yield any results
" ’’yechuri ne ek sawaal ke jawaab main kaha ki baatcheet prakriya par jammu kashmir ke vibhinn samooh vibhajit hai
 "but the Prime Minister should take initiative to start the process by taking regional parties in confidence
" ’’ kashmir main ek dashak baad sena kii tainaati ke bare main puche jane par unhone kaha ki makapa kaa hameshaa maananaa rahaa he ki sena ko aantarik sthiti se mukaable main shaamil nahin kiya janaa chahie
 He said, "the army should be called only on issues like border issue or sovereignty of the country

 damakal adhikariyon ne kaha ki yah ghatana railway stesan ke plateform 12 or 13 par aparaahn do bajkar 50 minute par hui
 He said that we got a call about a stampede at the railway station
 kareeb 14 se 15 log isamen ghayal hue hai
 This incident happened due to the congestion of passengers

 unhone bataaya ki rail mantri ne ghatana par hardik shok vyakt karte hue ghayalon ke ilaaj kaa samuchit prabandh karne kaa bhi nirdesh diya
 Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee has denied reports that he had to deal with fixing the price of 2G spectrum and criticized those who propagated the issue
 2007 main jab mukherjee videshmantri the, unhen 3ji spectrum khaali karne par mantriyon ke samooh kaa chairman niyukt kiya gaya tha, jiske bare main unhone kaha ki 2ji or iske mulya nirdhaaran se unka koi lenadena nahin tha
 He said that the gom was formed by the defense and paramilitary forces to vacate the spectrum and it was not entrusted with the task of pricing
 mukherjee ne kaha, sankshep main kahuun to meraa 2ji ke saath koi lenadena nahin tha
 Bahujan Samaj Party National President Mayawati on Monday targeted the Yogi Adityanath government
 mayawati ne somvaar ko kaha, 'upi kii bhaajapa sarkaar main kanoon kaa nahin balki yahaan gundon, badmaashon, mafiaon aadi kaa jangalraj chal rahaa he, jis kaaran ab puure pradesh main har prakaar ke aparaadh charam par hai or hatyaon kii to baadh si aa gai lagati he

 State Irrigation Minister Girish Mahajan while talking to NDTV India regarding this action said that the state government will not take any kind of leniency towards the corrupt people
 kaanoon apana kaam karata rahegaa
 It may be noted that before coming to power, BJP had claimed that Rs 70,000 crore irrigation scam took place during the congress-ncp rule in Maharashtra and they will not spare its culprits after coming to power

 com / cybkonlkt6aise bhi koi kisi ko haraata he kya! # indvban The CBI is investigating the cases of forcibly impotence of hundreds of Dera Sacha Saudas
 isi bich sibiai kii team ne adaalat ko saunpi gai apni report main kai chaunkaane vaale khulaase kiye hai
 According to the report, Gurmeet Ram Rahim had announced in 1999, as a collective, to impotent the sadhus of the camp

 The important thing is that Ram Rahim himself used to be present there when the sages were impotent
 sibiai report ke mutabik saadhuon ke badhiyaakaran ke oparation ke samay vah oparation theatre main khud maujuud rahata tha
 Operation CBI report also used to be held in Baba's cave, that even in his infamous cave, he forcibly made many sadhus impotent
 vah purush saadhuon ko apni badnaam gupha main bhi napunsak banavaata tha
 After this, Gurmeet Ram Rahim used to play a variety of sports with impotent sadhus
 un par uski vishesh krupa rahati thi
 The impotent sages could openly meet Gurmeet Ram Rahim
 napunsak banaae gaye zyaadaatar the yuvavarsh 1999 se 2000 ke bich dere main napunsak banaae gaye zyaadaatar sadhu yuva the
 They were castrated in the name of intimidation and union with God

 sibiai ne dere kii 17 benami sampattiyon kaa record bhi apni report main sanlagn kiya he, jo napunsak banaaye gaye saadhuon ke naam par kharidi gai thim
 Significantly, in Haryana alone, Dera Sacha Sauda has assets of more than Rs 1600 crore
 jinamein jameen bhi shaamil he
 The verdict in the criminal case of demolition of Babri Masjid structure in Ayodhya in a special CBI court in Lucknow is expected by April 2020
 vishesh sibiai adaalat ne abhiyojan paksh dwaara saboot or gavaahi pesh karne kii aakhri taarikh 24 disambar tay kii he
 The prosecution was recently reprimanded for not bringing a witness against the then Chief Minister Kalyan Singh despite repeated orders by the court after the charges were framed on September 29, 2019
 paanch oktober ko satr adaalat ne kaha tha ki ucchtam nyaayalay ke aadesh ke mutabik sabhi gavaahon ko 24 disambar, 2019 tak prastut karnaa hoga or yah taarikh (is maamle main) aakhri kaary diwas hoga
 The trial against BJP leaders Lal Krishna Advani, Uma Bharti and Murali Manohar Joshi began on May 25, 2017 in this special court in Lucknow as the Supreme Court rejected the Allahabad High Court's decision to acquit them in the case

 In the past, there has been opposition to cinema and attack on cinemahal
 pehle bhi to kai baar samskruti or dharm ke apmaan kii baaten hui hai
 Everything has already happened, which is happening due to opposition to 'pk' (PK)
 paksh or vipaksh main jo kuch bhi kaha ja rahaa he, vah pehle kai baar kaha ja chukaa he
 Who is the problem 
 
 ? unase, jo baba dharm ke naam par tarah-tarah ke karmkand bataakar logon se thag rahe hai yaa unase, jo aisa karne vaale baabaaon par filmein or naatak bana rahe hai
 Has the incident of claiming to be a deity in front of people in the name of religion not happened in real life? asaram or rampal ne jo kuch kiya, kya vah dharm kii garima ke anukool tha
 Why not tear the poster of 'pk' film and tear the poster of such babas
 kya ve dharm ke naam par thagi karne vaale tathakthith santon ko bhi dharm kaa rakshak maanate hai
 
 
 The Should these organizations that patronize religion be given legal rights in the name of faith? 
 
 ? yahi log dharm kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai, yah faisla kab or kisne kiya he
 The year 2012 also had a film, 'OMG, o My God'
 
 
 'pk' ke bare main kaha ja rahaa he, 'OMG' jaisi he
 The film was co-produced by Paresh Rawal, with Akshay Kumar in the lead role
 is film kaa virodh bajrang dal, shivasena or kuch akhabaaron kii report ke anusaar punjab pradesh mahila congress ne bhi kiya tha
 Sushma Swaraj had said in an RSS meeting that Hindu deities are under attack, and that she would raise the issue in the Lok Sabha about the film
 tab sushamaa swaraj vipaksh main thi or ab videshmantri hai
 'OMG' artist and producer Paresh Rawal is a BJP MP and is considered close to the Prime Minister
 virodh ke samay bhi paresh rawal peeche nahin hate the
 The essence of what he said in the media then is that we have made this film thoughtfully
 main bhi ishwar main yakeen rakhata hum, lekin us tak pahunchane ke mahange karmkaandon ke khilaaf hum
 Will those who oppose 'OMG' speak against Paresh Rawal as the film is still seen and seen
 kya virdohi bataaenge ki 'OMG' ke virodh kaa kya states he
 The question here is not whether Paresh Rawal or Aamir Khan are Hindus or Muslims
 sawaal he ki dharm ke naam par rose paidaa ho rahi buraaiyon ke khilaaf koi kuch kah saktaa he yaa nahin
 The film 'pk' has satire on rituals and prapancha, but is not limited to any one religion
 ant main film vahi kahati he, jo har mazahab kahata he ki insaan se prem karo or ek-duusare par bharosa karo
 Does this thing not make any religion better? kya sati pratha, bal vivaah, chuaachhut ke khilaaf sangharsh karne vaale mahaan log hindu dharm kaa apmaan kar rahe the
 
 
 The agar kisi ko yah lagata he ki filmon main sirf hindu devi-devataaon par hamalaa kiya jaataa he to unhen pakistan ke film nirmaataa shoeb mansoor kii film 'khuda ke liye' dekhni chahie
 This film made in the year 2007 is more direct and better than 'OMG' and 'pk'
 'khuda ke liye' main mansoor ne kamedi kaa sahaara nahin liya he, balki aankh main aankh daalkar kaha he ki islam musalmaan kii dadhi main nahin he
 In many films and articles, from Islamic fundamentalism to rituals, there has been criticism and is happening daily
 'pk' kaa virodh karne waalon ko pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa bhaashan dobaaraa sunanaa chahie
 It is another matter that while talking about Ganesh ji's plastic surgery, he only lightened his talk, but still his speech in Parliament should be considered more formal
 june maheene main raashtrapati ke abhibhaashan ke samarthan main pradhanmantri modi ne kaha tha ki hamen garibon ko andhvishwaas or andhbhakti se azaad karana he
 In a program at AIIMS Hospital, Prime Minister Modi told medical students that we have to expand scientific thinking more and more
 dharm or samskruti kii umr iske khatre ke naam par raajnneeti karne waalon kii umr se kai hazaar saal zyaada he
 Religion and culture have taken threats and maintained their existence before and without them
 behatar hoga ki in sanghathanon ke netaa or kaaryakarta bhi 'pk' dekh aaen or film kaa tarkpurvak virodh karen, kyonki yah unka adhikaar banataa he, lekin poster faadna or bain kii maang karnaa thodaa zyaada ho jaataa he
 How about the idea of answering 'pk' by making a film in support of babas
 
 
 ? UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi has been given a jolt by Trinamool Congress's Mamata Banerjee and Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav bypassing her suggested names for the presidency
 itnaa hi nahin netaa dway ne purv raashtrapati apije abdul kalam, pradhanmantri manmohan singh or teesraa naam purv loksabhaadhyaksh somnath chatarji kaa naam sujhaayaa he
 Mulayam Singh Yadav and Mamata Banerjee have discussed three names on Wednesday for the presidential candidate
 donon netaaon kaa kahana he ki yadi in teenon naamon par ek sahmati ban jaati he to vah swaagat yogya hoga
 At the same time, after this news NCP leader Sharad Pawar said that now it is necessary that all the parties once again have a dialogue
 mamata or mulaayam ke bayaan par unka kahana he ki kisi ek naam par unka kuch kahana philhal thik nahin he
 The BJP today discussed the three names suggested by the SP and Trinamool Congress for the presidency but said it would react only after the Congress announced the top constitutional nominee
 udhar der shaam piemo karyaalay ke mantri narayansami vittamantri se milane gaye or baatcheet kaa byoraa hasil nahin ho paaya he
 The Congress party announced late in the evening that the candidate of their choice would win the presidential election
 sutara yah bhi bataa rahe hai pradhanmantri ke videsh se lautne ke baad is maamle par charchaa kii jaaegi or raashtrapati pad ke liye naam bhi antim faisla piem ke swadesh aane par liya jayega
 Significantly, after meeting Sonia Gandhi a few hours ago, Mamata Banerjee said that she would take a final decision after consulting the leaders of her party's Trinamool
 vaise mamata ne saaf kiya ki raashtrapati pad ke pratyaashee ke rup main congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi kii pehali pasand pranab mukherjee hi hai, jabaki duusari pasand ke taur par vartmaan uparashtrapati hamid ansaari ko vah sheersh pad par dekhnaa chaahati hai
 After this meeting, Mamta Banerjee went directly to Mulayam Singh Yadav's house and it is being said that Mamta Banerjee will discuss about the presidential candidate there too
 isse pehle, congress va upie adhyaksh sonia gandhi ke bulaave par dilli pahunchin pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri va trinmul congress kii pramukh mamata banerjee kii sonia se hui mulaakaat se pehle sutron ne jaankaree di thi ki mamata kii list main pranab mukherjee kaa naam sabase neeche he, jabaki unki pasand ke taur par pashchim bengal ke purv rajyapal gopal gandhi, loksabhaa adhyaksh mira kumaar or purv raashtrapati apije abdul kalam ke naam sutron ne bataae the
 However, meeting Mamata's Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav on Tuesday before meeting Sonia was seen as a murmur of new equations and it was believed that Mamata had asked Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee for upa's candidature for the presidency
 Has agreed in the name of
 unhone kaha bhi tha ki is baat se unhen khushi hogi, yadi desh ke is sarvocch pad par bengal kaa koi netaa aae
 But he also wishes that the Congress opens its cards first, and declares Pranab's name as a candidate
 tippaniyan On the other hand, the Congress has given the right to choose the candidate on its behalf to Sonia Gandhi, but she is also aware that the Congress does not have enough votes to give its candidate a definite victory, hence Mulayam Singh's SP and Mamta That Trinamool's support will be compulsory for the Congress, and perhaps that's why Sonia Gandhi wants to be fully satisfied before announcing the candidate on her behalf
 philhal congress kaa daawa he ki is maamle main puraa upie ek he, or unke is daawey ko is baat se bhi bal miltaa he ki mayawati kii bispi, or karunanidhi kii diemke bhi pranab ke naam par sahmati jataa chuke hai
 It is also being said that the Congress wants to settle this issue by Friday, June 15, and that is why Pranab has canceled his visit to Kabul starting on the 14th, which has led to speculation again
 is mudde main yah jaankaree bhi ahm he ki pradhanmantri dow manmohan singh 16 june se brazil va mexico kii yatra par ja rahe hai, or jald hi upie adhyaksh bhi ilaaj ke liye videsh jane vaali hai
 Meanwhile, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) has also made such a statement, which is going right in the direction of Pranab, so all the gestures are saying that Pranab is in the forefront of becoming the new highness of the country
 But the only problem is that the Congress has not officially named him yet
 raashtrapati pad ke pratyaashee ke liye mulaayam singh yadav or mamata banerjee ne buudhvaar ko teen naamon par charchaa kii he
 Both leaders say that if a consensus is reached on these three names, it would be welcome
 vahiin, is khabar ke baad ensipi netaa sharad pavaar ne kaha ki ab yah jaruri he ki sabhi partiyon se ek baar phir baatcheet kii jaae
 On the statement of Mamta and Mulayam, he says that it is not right for him to say anything on any one name
 sapa or trinmul congress kii ore se raashtrapati pad ke liye sujhaaye gaye teen naamon par bhaajapa ne aaj charchaa kii lekin kaha ki congress dwaara is sheersh sanvaidhanik pad ke ummidavaar kii ghoshnaa kiye jane ke baad hi vah apni pratikriya degi
 Meanwhile, PMO office minister Narayanasamy went to meet the finance minister and details of the talks have not been received
 congress party ne der shaam yah ghoshnaa kii ki unki pasand kaa hi ummidavaar raashtrapati chunaav main jeet hasil karegaa
 Sources are also telling that after the Prime Minister returns from abroad, the matter will be discussed and the final decision for the name of the President will also be taken when the PM comes home
 gauratlab he ki kuch ghanton pehle hi mamata banerjee ne sonia gandhi se mulaakaat karne ke baad kaha ki apni party trinmul ke netaaon se salaah lekar vah koi antim faisla lengi
 However, Mamata made it clear that Pranab Mukherjee is the first choice of Congress President Sonia Gandhi as the presidential candidate, while she wants to see the current Vice President Hamid Ansari as the second choice
 is mulaakaat ke baad mamata banerjee sidhe mulaayam singh yadav ke ghar gayi or kaha ja rahaa he ki vahaan par bhi mamata banerjee raashtrapati pad ke ummidavaar ke bare main charchaa karengi
 Earlier, before the meeting of West Bengal Chief Minister and Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee reached Delhi on the call of Congress and UPA President Sonia Gandhi, sources had informed that Pranab Mukherjee's name is at the bottom of Mamta's list, While his choice was former West Bengal Governor Gopal Gandhi, Lok Sabha Speaker Meira Kumar and former President APJ a Dul Kalam sources were telling him
 haalanki sonia se mulaakaat se pehle mangalvaar ko mamata kii samaajawaadee party pramukh mulaayam singh yadav se milanaa nae sameekaran kii sugabugahat ke taur par dekha ja rahaa tha or mana ja rahaa tha ki mamata ne raashtrapati pad kii upie kii ore se ummidavaari ke liye vittamantri pranab mukherjee ke naam par sahmati de di he
 He had also said that he would be happy with this, if a leader of Bengal comes to this highest post of the country
 parantu unki yah bhi ichha he ki congress pehle apane pattey khole, or ummidavaar ke rup main pranab ke naam kaa elaan kare
 The comments duusari ore, congress apni ore se ummidavaar chunane kaa adhikaar sonia gandhi ko de chuki he, lekin unhen yah bhi dhyaan he ki congress ke paas apane itane vot nahin hai ki ve apane ummidavaar ko nishchit jeet dilaa saken, isliye mulaayam singh kii sapa or mamata kii trinmul kaa saath congress ke liye anivaary hoga, or shaayad isiilie sonia gandhi apni ore se ummidavaar kaa elaan karne se pehle puri tasalli kar lenaa chaahati hai
 At present, the Congress claims that the entire UPA is one in this case, and their claim is also bolstered by the fact that Mayawati's BSP, and Karunanidhi's DMK have also agreed on Pranab's name
 yah bhi kaha ja rahaa he ki congress shuukravaar, 15 june tak yah masalaa nipta lenaa chaahati he, or isiilie pranab ne 14 taarikh se shuru hone vaala apana kabul daura radd kar diya he, jisase phir atakalein lagane lagi hai
 It is also important to know in this issue that Prime Minister Dr
 Manmohan Singh is going to visit Brazil and Mexico from 16 June, and soon the UPA President will also be going abroad for treatment
 is bich, rashtravaadi congress party (ensipi) ne bhi aisa bayaan diya he, jo ishaaron main hi sahi, pranab ke haq main ja rahaa he, so, saare ishaare yahi bataa rahe hai ki pranab desh ke nae mahamahim banane kii daud main sabase aage hai, lekin mushkil sirf itani he ki congress ne abhi aadhikarik taur par unka naam nahin liya he
 At the same time, after this news NCP leader Sharad Pawar said that now it is necessary that all the parties once again have a dialogue
 mamata or mulaayam ke bayaan par unka kahana he ki kisi ek naam par unka kuch kahana philhal thik nahin he
 The BJP today discussed the three names suggested by the SP and Trinamool Congress for the presidency but said it would react only after the Congress announced the top constitutional nominee

 In pursuance of this policy, the Government of India has decided to declare the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh illegal

 The activities of the RSS have clearly threatened the existence of the state and the government
 hamaari report bataati he ki pratibandh ke baavjood yah gatividhiyaan khatm nahin huin
 In September 1948, the then head of the RSS, Madhav Sadashiv Golwalkar, wrote a letter to Sardar Patel demanding the lifting of the ban on the Sangh
 jiske jawaab main sardaar ne likhaa, 'hindu samaaj ko sangathit karnaa or unki madad karnaa ek baat he, lekin unke kashton ke liye nirdosh, asahaay, mahilaon or bacchon se badla lenaa duusari baat he
 All his speeches are full of communal poison

 The result of this poison had to be repaid by the sacrifice of Gandhiji
 'is chitthee ke baad sardaar patel se golvarkar kii do baar or mulaakaat hui
 The ban was finally lifted from the Sangh on 11 July 1949 when the then RSS chief MS Golwalkar gave a written assurance, agreeing to Sardar Patel's terms
 yah pratibandh is shart ke saath hataaya gaya ki aresas apana samvidhan banaae or use prakashit kare, jisamen loktantric dhang se chunaav hon

 Air Force Chief Arup Raha on Sunday said the manner in which this happened during the Chinese incursion into Ladakh and the visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping to India is a 'mystery'
 rahaa ne aaj yah baat kahi
 He also said that the Indian security forces are stuck on the border and are not going to leave any piece of land
 8 aktubar ko bhartiya vayusena kii 82veen varshganth se pehle unhone samvaadadaataaon se kaha, 'yah hameshaa se rahasy rahaa he ki jis tareeke se ghuspaith hoti he or vibhinn daure ke samay jis tareeke se yah hota he, isamen kuch bhi nayaa nahin he, yah ham sabake liye rahasy bana hua he
 ' unhone kaha, 'aap sabhi jaanate hai ki kootneeti main kaaphi kuch sankethik hota he, khaskar hamaare uttari padosi ke saath
 This may be part of a clue in my mind, but I'm not going to speculate on what it actually means
 ' He, however, clarified that India 'is not going to leave any piece of land
 ' rahaa ne bharat or china kii sena ke baar-baar aamane-saamne hone ke liye vaastavik niyantran rekha ke paas donon deshon kii vaastavik sthiti ko lekar alag-alag vichaar hone ko jimmedaar bataaya
 He said, 'there are different views about where the LAC is, due to which the army comes face to face
 baharhaal hamaare suraksha bal nitiyon kaa anupaalan kar rahe hai, ham kisi ko bhi jameen nahin de rahe hai
 ' china ke saath lagati seemaa ke paas sainya dhaanchon ke nirmaan ke liye uthaae gaye kadamon kaa zikr karte hue rahaa ne kaha ki ladakh ke nyoma main ladaaku vimaanon kaa base banaaya ja rahaa he

 unhone kaha ki kargil main ek anya base banegaa or iske liye jald hi dhanrashi jari kii jaaegi
 He said, 'these bases are strategically important to us and will enhance our capabilities
 ' unhone kaha ki purvottar main chah or vaayu addon kaa unnayan kiya ja rahaa he or yah kaam 2015 ke ant tak puraa ho jayega

 COP-14 main Bamboonomics par bharat ko riprogent karegaa ye khiladisheli shaury ne adivaasiyon kii arthvyavastha ko majubat banane kaa bejod formula diaindian premier lig (ipel) ke gujarat liance team kaa hissaa rahe or manipur kii ore se ranjai trophy khilne vaale shelli shaury ne adivaasiyon kii arthvyavastha ko majboot banane kaa bejod formula diya he
 The Modi government is also implementing his formula
 25 saal ke shelli shaury ne Bamboonomics par jo theory di he, uske jariye bans se acchhee kamai ke saath-saath badhate pradooshan ko bhi niyantrit kiya ja saktaa he
 196 countries are participating in COP-14
 Actually, Modi government wants to make tribals competent and prosperous by implementing bamboo-based economy
 yahi vajah he ki 2017 main bans ko ped kii shrenee se hataakar ghaas ghoshit kiya gaya
 Considering the growing demand from bamboo, the plan for environmentally friendly Bamboonomics is to be presented today at COP-14 (conference of Parties) by the tribal ministry
 is conference main Bamboonomics par shelli shaury bharat ko riprogent kar rahe hai
 Significantly, COP-14 is organized to save the world from increasing desertification
 duniya ke 196 deshon ke pratinidhi is conference main bhaag le rahe hai
 The goal of making barren land fertile has been increased
 On September 9, Prime Minister Narendra Modi also reached this conference going on from September 2
 is dauraan unhone kaha tha ki bharat 2030 tak 2
 2, increasing its target to make 1 crore hectares of barren land fertile
 6 karod hectare karegaa
 To tackle desertification, Modi said that between 2015 and 2017, the area of trees and forests in India has increased by 8 lakh hectares
 uttar purvi rajyon ko hoga zyada phaaydadilli ke saint stephen college se iconomics main graduate shelli ne Bamboonomics par jo richars kii he usase sabase zyada phayda uttar purvi rajyon ko milegaa jo bhugolic paristhitiyon ke kaaran kai yojanaon or vikaas kaa laabh uthaane se vanchit rah jate hai
 In such a situation, the bamboo-based economy has emerged as a new hope for progress for the people there
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne bans ko indian forest act 1927 se hataakar jab ghaas suchit kiya tha tab unhone adivaasiyon ke kalyaan kaa ek sapana dekha tha
 To pursue that dream, Shelley Shaurya also wrote and researched a book called Bamboonomics: The Tall Grass Comes of Age 'which the Tribal Cooperative Marketing Development Federation of India (TRIFED) has secured in TRIFED
 TRIFED ke saath milakar kii research2 sitambar se chal rahe is conference main 9 sitambar ko pradhanmantri narendra modi bhi pahunche the
 During this time, he had announced that India by 20302
 1 karod hectare banjar jameen ko upjau banane ke apane lakshya ko badhaakar 2
 6 crore hectares will do
 modi ne marusthalikaran se nipatane ke liye kaha ki 2015 or 2017 ke bich bharat main ped or jangal ke daayre main 8 lakh hectare kii badhotaree hui he

 aap netaa ashutosh ne bhi gopal raay ke hi sur main sur milaate aap kii haar kaa thikra iviem par hi phoda
 Nagendra Sharma, who is associated with the AAP, taunted the BJP and said that for the last decade, he has won without cleaning the streets of Delhi
 aakhir aisa ho bhi kyon na, jab mashin(iviem) aapke saath ho to aapaki ichha kaa koi matlab nahin rah jaataa
 However, in the meantime, AAP leaders have gathered at the house of Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal to discuss the reasons for the defeat
 ullekhneey he ki dilli nagar nigam chunaav ke nattejey aane se pehle jab agsit pole aae the to gopal raay ne kuch isi andaaj main baat kahi thi
 At that time when Gopal Rai was asked, he said that if the EVM is run then this survey is correct, but our condition may be worse, but if the public works, the Aam Aadmi Party is at number 1 and very big today
 Aam Aadmi Party will win the election by margin
 tippaniyan Earlier, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had lashed out at the State Election Commission, saying that reports of 'bad' electronic voting machines (evms) were coming from every part of Delhi on polling day
 unhone yah aarope bhi lagaaya ki maanya voter parchiyaan hone ke baad bhi kai votaron ko nagar nigam chunaav main apane matadhikaar kaa prayog nahin karne diya gaya
 It is worth mentioning that Kejriwal had earlier demanded that the election be postponed until arrangements were made to hold an EVM equipped with VVPAT

 rajya chunaav ayog kar kya rahaa he?' ayog ke ek adhikari ne sweekaar kiya ki kuch jagahon se 'takneekee gadabadi' kii khabaren ai hai, lekin un gadabadiyon ko dur kar diya gaya
 It is worth mentioning that when exit poll came before the results of the Municipal Corporation of Delhi elections, Gopal Rai had said something similar
 us vakt jab gopal raay se poocha gaya to unhone kaha ki agar EVM kii chalati he to ye survey sahi he, balki hamaari haalat isse bhi buree ho sakati he, lekin agar janata kii chali to aam aadmi party aaj number 1 par he or bahut bade margin se aam aadmi party chunaav jeetegi
 The comments usase pehle dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne rajya chunaav ayog ko aade haath lete hue kaha tha ki matdaan ke din 'kharaab' electronic voting mashiinon (iviem) kii khabaren dilli ke har hisse se aa rahi hai
 He also alleged that despite having valid voter slips, many voters were not allowed to exercise their franchise in the municipal elections

 ’ On the occasion of Deepawali, worship in various forms of Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth, is the center of this festival
 lekin kya kabhi ye sawaal lakshmi kii murti ko dekhakar man main uthaa ki jahaan kahin lakshmi kii pratimaa dikhaai detii he vahaan hathi or uski sound se bahati jaldhara bhi dikhti he
 Has anyone ever tried to know what could be the logic behind this? lakshmi agar sukh or samruddhi kaa pratik he to hathi ek shaakaahaari pashu hone ke saath saath devataaon main indra kii sawari ke taur par dekha jaataa he
 In such a situation, what is the relationship between the trunk flowing with elephant's stream with Lakshmi
 devi lakshmi bhagwaan vishnu kii patni hai
 And in the depiction of the stories, Lakshmi is shown pressing the feet of Vishnu lying on the Sheshnag
 iske baavjood swarg ke tamaam vaibhav or aishwarya kaa swami indra ko hi kyon niyukt kiya gaya he
 What could be the reason behind this? kahin lakshmi kaa arth lakshya to nahin
 It is said that Goddess Durga, a symbol of power, keeps her hair open despite wearing wedding dress and jewelery
 or ye bhi vyakhya kii gai he ki unke khule kesh kisi ek avasthaa ke prati unki manaahi kaa pratik he
 So does Durga stand at one end, between nature and culture
 yaa phir iskaa koi or rahasy he
 Could this question ever distract anyone's mind
 bharat kii tantric parampara ke mutabik teen pramukh deviyon lakshmi, saraswati or gauri ke prakatya kaa kya kissa he or is kisse main teenon dev brahma vishnu or mahesh kii kya bhoomika he
 Does anyone know all this? yaa kisi ke bhi man aise sawaal dastak dete hai
 But Devdatta Patnaik, who has a strong hold on mythological subjects, has dealt with such curious questions with full vigor and compiled whatever research has been explained in the Vedas and Puranas along with the research done all over the world, It has done a huge job of presenting the book in the form
 devi ke saat rahasy naam kii pustak main devdatt patnayak ne yunaan se lekar hindustan tak jahaan kahin bhi devi pujan kii mahatta he, uski na sirf vyakhya kii he balki samaaj main deviyani stri ke vibhinn swarupon kaa aisa varnan bhi karne kaa hausala dikhaaya he, jiske bare main shaayad hamaara samaaj sochane kii himmat nahin rakh paata
 Along with this, through this book, Devdutt Dutt Patnaik also tried to touch on some such questions, which if arisen but disappeared somewhere in the struggle of emotion and domination
 jaise lakshmi kaa vishnu ke charan dabaanaa kya ye purush varchasv kaa pratik he
 Or if Kali is seen standing on the chest of Shiva, then is this woman the highest peak of power? If Shiva is Ardhanarishvara, is it the beginning of sexual equality? yani tamaam hindu dharm se zudi kathaayen pratik or reeti-rivaaj hamaare samaaj kii khubi or khaamiyon ke bare main kya bataate hai
 What is it that has been tried to reveal our truth through these symbols, and which has not yet been interpreted and propagated in the society
 hindutv main stri ko devi kaa rup mana gaya he
 Desh is the practice of worship and rituals in different forms of Goddess in different parts of the world
 prakruti se lekar mata tak ko devi kaa sthaan diya gaya he
 Goddess has also been considered as the ultimate stage of humanity's superiority and knowledge
 lekin devi se jude pratik or karmkaandon ko lekar adikaal se bahes hoti rahi he
 But what they mean remains, Devdutt Patnaik has tried to explain these things in the Seven Secrets of the Goddess

 haal hi main jab blueberi ne android besd DTEK50 smartphone launch kiya tha tab hi company kii taraf se hardware bijness khatm karne kaa ishaara kar diya gaya tha
 Because the development of that smartphone was done by tcl's subsidiary Alcatel, not blackberry
 ab company mobile bijness band karnaa kaa elaan aadhikarik taur par kar diya he
 a few months ago, the company's CEO, John Shen, also made it clear that if the mobile business did not turn profitable by September, it would be closed
 sitambar aa gaya or company or jaahir he company ne phayda na hone kii vajah se apana mobile bijness band karne kaa faisla kiya
 However, it is not the case that new blackberry smartphones will not be seen in the coming days
 kyonki company ne kaha he ki wo apane partner companiyon se hardware develop karaayegi
 That is, the company can launch some more smartphones which will have the same branding of blackberry
 baharhaal, ab duniya kii do badi mobile companiyaan jo ek vakt main market leader hua karti thim philhal bazaar se baahar hai
 US President Barack Obama used blackberry smartphones for better security, but now it is not so because of the falling graph of blackberry, US President has also stopped using it
 blueberi kii pahchaan iske QWERTY keyboard or ek red lite thi jisase ise duusare phone se alag lagata tha
 We will tell you about blackberry's hit and flop mobile, which will make it easy to understand why its mobile business blackberry Quark 6210 (hit) was discontinued, it can be considered the most influential gadget in the history of people
 ise lagbhag 13 saal pehle 2003 main launch kiya gaya tha or tab ise smartphone kaha jaataa tha
 It had features like email, web browser, SMS and Blackberry Messenger, due to which business users were crazy about it
 blackberry Pearl (hit)multimedia or miseging fitures se las is phone ne 2007 main mobile bazaar main tahalaka machaa diya tha
 Trackball was given for the first time in it
 iske alaava isamen ek batan main do letters vaala keyboard diya gaya tha jisaki vajah se slim dikhataa tha
 Many versions of it were launched
 blackberry Curve (hit)agar aap blueberi yujar nahin rahe hai phir bhi aapane iskaa naam to suna hi hoga
 This smartphone launched in 2007 became quite popular
 isamen trekkbal ke saath phul keyboard diya gaya tha or isaki keemat bhi baari bharkam nahin thi
 Its compact design and features not only attracted business users like other blackberry phones, but common users also liked it
 iske kai varent launch hue or isi kaa ek vairient america president obama bhi yuj karte the
 The company launched this smartphone in 2008 on the lines of blackberry Bold (hit) Curve phone
 isamen bhi keyboard or trekkbal tha, lekin yah Curve ke mukaable zyada premiam tha kyonki isamen ledar back diya gaya tha
 It also has a better camera
 company ne ise 2009 or 2010 main dubaara launch kiya tha
 However, many experts believe that along with this smartphone, the credibility of blackberry had started to decline as many better smartphones started coming in the market
 blackberry Z10 (flop)2013 main blueberi ne pehali baar BB10 oparating system ke saath Z10 smartphone launch kiya
 Along with this, the company tried to remove its popular QWARTY keyboard and tried to gain market share through full touch screen
 haalanki company appal or samsung ke android smartphone se takkar lene main naakaamayaab dikhi
 After this, the company launched the Q10 in which the company again gave the full keyboard but it used to run only on the BB10 OS
 company is placeform par nae smartphone ke saath fail sabit hui
 Experts and customers gave different opinions after the launch of this blackberry smartphone with a passport size of blackberry Passport (flop)
 ek taraf exparts ne ise behtareen opshan bataaya, lekin aam janata ne is baari bharkam smartphone ko sire se nakaar diya or yah flop ho gaya
 However, the bigger keyboard and better camera did excite some business segments
 blackberry Priv (flop)bazaar main android or appal kaa kabja ho gaya or blueberi kii naiyya doobane lagi
 Taking a historic decision, the company announced to bring Android smartphone so that new life could be revived in the company
 2015 main smartphone launch hua or dilachasp yah he ki ye smartphone kaaphi behtareen he
 But its high prices did not leave many to flop it
 bharat jaise vishaal smartphone bazaar ne bhi ise nakaar diya
 It can be considered as the last nail in the blackberry mobile coffin
 blackberry DTEK 50 (flop)priv launch karne ke baad company ko yah samaj aayaa ki itane baari bharkam keemat main android smartphone to hit hone se rahaa
 So the company launched an Android-based budget smartphone and called it the most secure smartphone in the world

 ye wo vakt he jab aapako thodaa jor lagaana padegaa, kyonki aapako jis aadat, soch or saamaajikta ko badalanaa he, wo saalon se jami, bahut puraani gahari soch he
 It is also a time to change yourself with others
 chalane kaa, or chalane dene kaa vaqt he
 The effort to change it will also be long, because it has become deeply ingrained in our habit
 jab ham gaadi chalaanaa shuru karte hai to paidal yatriyon ko rukaawat maanate hai or ye bhul jate hai ki jab ham paidal nikalate hai to gadiyon kii manamaani kitna pareshaan karti he
 And the tension between this friction increases so much that both the pedestrian and the carriage lose their cool
 bina ye samajhe hue ki hamaari trekkic vyavastha ek aise dushchakra main chali gai he jise rokna badi chunauti he
 The result of this is that every day starts with dialogues like "no visible" on the streets, "blind is what", "why can't walk on the shore", "what is hobby of self-interest"
 or shuruyaat aisi hogi to puraa din kaisaa hoga, iskaa andaaza lagaaya ja saktaa he
 Now look at it a bit, you will know that this vicious cycle is actually quite simple
 pehla hissaa he futapaath
 If you look at the roads across the country, you will find that there are no sidewalks anywhere
 futapaath hai bhi to yaa to un par rehadi waalon ne qabza kar liya he yaa koodaydaan ke rup main istemaal ho rahaa he yaa futapaath itane oonche hai ki chadhana or utarana naammumkin sa ho gaya he yaa phir aisi tuuti-phooti haalat main he jisapar chalanaa mushkil hota he
 And then the result - people were forced to walk on the streets
 doosraa hissaa yah he ki jab paidal sadakon par chalenge to gaadiyaan kahaan jaaengi? or yaheen par aakar aisa tanaav or aisa takaraav hota he jo ham rose jhelte hai
 And what is the result of this conflict? Death of pedestrians around 15 thousand annually
 jisamen ye samajhane vaali baat he ki in maut ke peeche keval gadiyon kii galati nahin hoti he
 Whether it is the driver, the pedestrian or the administration, the pedestrian suffers
 isiilie inhen sabase asurakshit road yuzar kaha jaataa he
 The third part is that due to increasing fear and inconvenience on the road day by day, people are now avoiding to walk at every cost
 car nahin to scooter kaa istemaal kar rahe hai
 Now going from morning walk to bringing vegetables to middle class car or scooter
 yani paidal yatri ye maan baithe hai ki ab sadak par unki jagah nahin rahi he
 But what about those people whose compulsion to walk, thirty percent of the country's population
 jiske paas apni car yaa tu whealer nahin he
 What about them We are seeing their fate
 haal hi main dilli main paidal yatriyon kii maut ke aankade aae hai
 Which are shocking, but few are shocked
 saal 2013 main dilli main kul 749 paidal yatriyon ne apni jaan ganvaa di
 Delhi's traffic, irresponsible drivers, negligence of people and poor road design gave life of misery to seven hundred and fifty families
 or sochie dilli main haalat kitni karaab he ki sadak haadason main maare jane waalon main se 41 fisadi paidal yatri hai
 Whereas, this is just above the average 10% across the country
 ab dilli trekkic police kuch koshish kar rahi he
 Police has again appealed to the people to claim the flag
 or ye bhi kaha he ki jahaan bhi futapaath par kisi tareeke kii banaavati rukaawat, qabza yaa park kii gai gaadiyaan dekhen use nazarandaaz na karen
 Take a photo of it and send it to the traffic police's Facebook page or whatsapp
 isliye liye mobile number bhi diya gaya he 8750871493
 
 
 
 zarurat he sabhi shaharon main abhi se is tarah kii muhim shuru kii jaae, logon kii soch banaai jaae
 If we do not try this today, then in the coming tomorrow, this problem will take such a form that it was impossible to guess a few years ago
 kuch logon ne paidal chalane kii koshish kii he, rahgiri ke naam se or desh ke kai hisson main ravivaar kii subah ab gadiyon kaa chalanaa band karvaa kar shahar ke kisi ek kone main paidal chal rahe hai
 Such right to walk in all cities needs to be withdrawn, and not a few hours a day, twenty-four hours

 Major General Anil Verma (retd), the head of the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR), told India Today that the analysis of income figures of national parties from 2013-14 to 2016-17 shows that the general elections before the 2014 general elections The income of the parties had increased
 tiemasi kii aay 2015-16 main sabase zyada hui, usee saal pashchim bengal main vidhansabha chunaav hue the
 According to experts, the sharp increase in bsp's income in 2016-17 could be due to the assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh and the party could overcome the impact of demonetisation
 major general verma (ritred) ne kaha ki jab partiyon ko 20,000 rupee se upar ke donneton ko dekhen to badi dilachasp sthiti saamne aati he
 Compared to 2014-15 and 2015-16, there was a sharp increase in such donations in the income of Congress and CPI

 The Defense Minister said that Rahul Gandhi is worried about taking his name here
 unhone kaha ki mujhe is sadan main jhootha kaha gaya, pradhanmantri ko jagah-jagah apshabd kaha gaya
 The Congress people then had no regrets
 hamaara koi sammaan nahin he kya? unhone congress adhyaksh par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha, ‘‘peeche khandaan kaa naam hone se kisi ko pradhanmantri ko apshabd kehane kaa haq nahin mil jaataa

 The fate of the Modi government is good because inflation was the main electoral issue in the 2014 general elections

 Its prices in the Indian basket dropped from $ 113 per barrel in May 2014 to $ 50 in January 2015
 iske baad lambey samay tak isi daayre main bane rahe
 Why the US embargo on Tejiran, after the announcement of not extending the rebate given to some major countries, including India, after May 2, the trend in crude oil prices continues
 haalanki is bich america main tel kaa bhandar badhane kii report ke baad teji par brake laga, lekin uskaa asar zyada samay tak nahin rahaa
 Petrol and diesel will again become expensive in India due to rising crude oil prices
 haalanki bharat sarkaar ne tel kii aapurti paryaapt hone kaa daawa kiya he
 Energy expert Narendra Taneja says that the concern of the Indian government is more than the supply of oil, the rising price of oil in the international market
 unhone kaha ki iran se tel kaa aayaat prabhavit hone se antarrashtriya bazaar main aane vaale dinon main brent crude kaa daam 80 dollar prati bairal tak ja saktaa he, joki bharat ke liye ek chintaa kaa vishay he
 India has already reduced oil imports from Iran and it has fallen by up to 50 percent
 iran duniya ke pramukh tel utpaadak deshon main shumaar he or vahaan se tel kii aapurti ghatane se daam main pehle se hi teji kaa rukh bana hua he
 Last year too, the price of Brent crude had gone up to $ 86 a barrel, which was the highest level since 2014
 gauratlab he ki opek or gaiyr-opek desh rus dwaara tel ke utpaadan main is saal janvari se 12 lakh bairal rojaanaa kii katautee kii ja rahi he jiske kaaran is saal tel ke daam main teji kaa rukh rahaa he
 Meanwhile, this boom was further supported by the US embargo on venezuela
iran is the world's largest oil producer, after the US, Saudi Arabia, Russia, Canada, China and Iraq, according to america agency energy information administration kii report ke anusaar, america, saudi arab, rus, canada, china or iraq ke baad iran duniya kaa sabase bada tel utpaadak desh he
 Iran's daily production 44 in 2018
 7 lakh bairal tha
 Ajay Kedia, director of Kedia Commodity, said that the production of oil by OPEC and non-opec country Russia is being cut by 1
2 million barrels daily from January this year, due to which the price of oil will increase this year
 Is trending
 is bich venezuela par america pratibandh se is teji ko or sahaara mila
 Kedia said OPEC may decide to increase oil production or reduce fixed cuts at a meeting in June before prices will continue to be supported by the supply crisis
 aise main 80 dollar prati bairal tak brent crude kaa bhav chalaa jaae isamen koi andeh nahin he
 Further, oil wells may be closed for some time in May for maintenance before the storm season begins in July – August in the US, which may lead to a reduction in production
 yah bhi tel kii keemton main aage teji aane kaa ek kaaran ho saktaa he

 yon shoshan kaa aarope lagane ke baad suspend kiye gaye jenpact ke vaais president swaroop raaj ke suicide karne ke maamle main logon kaa aakrosh badhata ja rahaa he
 On Monday, several people took out a candle march against Genpact, a Noida Sector-135 company
 badi sankhya main log jenpact ke get par ikattha hue, unhone company ke khilaaf narebaaji kii
 In March, Swaroop Raj's parents alleged that Genpact was responsible for his son's death
 company ne bina aaropon kii jaanch kiye hi swaroop par ection le liya
 The allegations made on Swaroop were baseless
 company ne unke bete kaa katl kiya he
 The company is solely responsible for this suicide
 jenpact ke vaais president swaroop raaj par me tu kaa aarope laga tha
 He then hanged himself on December 18 in his house in Noida Sector-135
 unki company kii do mahila karmchaariyon ne swaroop par yon shoshan kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 The company suspended him the same day without speaking to him
 iske baad swaroop raaj ne aatmahatya kar lee thi
 In the suicide note, Swaroop described himself as innocent
 unhone yah bhi likhaa tha ki jaanch ke baad sachai baahar aa jaaegi
 Noida Police has registered a case of abetment to suicide on Genpact and its officers
 police ne jo FIR darj kii he usamen wo 2 ladkiyaan bhi shaamil hai, jinhone swaroop raaj par chhedchhad kaa aarope lagaaya tha, police ke mutabik in donon se bhi poochtacha kii jaaegi
 Along with this, Sachin Kumar, Assistant Vice President of Genpact Company, HR, a committee officer to investigate the allegations of molestation, company officials responsible for suspension, Swarup Supervisor Sujoy Ghosh, CEO NV Tiger, Chief of HR Piyush Mehta, a case has been registered against Global Operating Officer Darren Saumur and all the executing directors
 noida police ne in sabhi ke khilaaf dhara 306 yani aatmahatya ke uksaane kaa maamla darj kiya he, police ab in sabhi se jald hi poochtacha karegi
 At the same time, there are many unresolved questions in this case
 swaroop kis tarah apni patni kirti ko is aarope ke bare main nahin bataa paae jabaki vah bhi usee company main kaam kar rahi thim
 Why did the company suspend him immediately, did the company blame Swaroop
 aakhir jaanch cameti ne unhen ek baar bhi safai kaa mauka kyon nahin diya
 The suicide note shows that the allegations are baseless, but all these questions need to be examined closely
 swaroop ke parivaar kaa kahana he ki agar mahilaon kaa yon shoshan hua to wo police ke paas kyon nahin gayi, report kyon nahin darj karai gai
 Why has the police now registered a case
 esaspi ajaypal sharma kaa kahana he ki jitne bhi aaropee hai un sabase poochtacha kii jaaegi
 Only then will it be clear what is the real reason behind the suicide? gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi dilli daure par hai
 Modi targeted Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in the morning
 dopaher main party netaa murali manohar joshi, sushamaa swaraj or adwani se mili or shaam ko bijepi daftar main unka sammaan hua or is dauraan party adhyaksh nitin gadakari bhi vahaan maujuud the
 Modi said that i am grateful for this honor
 modi ne kaha ki maine isi daftar main 11 varsh bitaye hai or yaheen se maine raajnneeti kii shuruyaat kii
 Earlier, Nitin Gadkari said that BJP under Modi's leadership has got success in Gujarat
 is dauraan modi ke liye 'piem piem' ke naare bhi lage
 Modi instead of thinking of getting ahead of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ruled states at the center and encouraging the Congress ruled states for this, keeps on digging such paths which are going to take the country into the pit
 gujarat main satta kii hetric puraa karne ke liye bhaajapa mukhyalay main yojit apane sammaan samaaroh main kaaryakartaaon ko sambodhit karte hue modi ne kaha ki indira gandhi ke naam par ek yojana chalati aa rahi he lambe samay se
 Even when Atalji was the Prime Minister, he continued this plan
 har chah maheene main is yojana kii samiksha hoti thi or gujarat lagaataar paanchavi baar isamen awwal rahaa
 He said that not only that there was no Congress and upa-ruled state in the top
 gujarat phir is yojana main sheersh par na aa jaae or congress kii fajihat na ho is dar se sarkaar ne isaki samiksha karaani hi band kar di, jabaki chahie tha ki vah congress shasit rajyon ko protsaahit karti bhaajapa shasit rajyon se pratidwandvita karne ke liye
 Modi said that the Congress government does not think ahead
 vah aise raste khodne main lagi rahati he jisase desh gadde main jaae
 Continuing the attack on the central government, Modi said that today i told the Prime Minister in the meeting of the National Development Council that you have no thinking, no action plan
 desh main niraashaa kaa maahaul ban rahaa he
 If this is the condition then the country will not know where
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar ne pichhali baar nau fisadi vikaas kaa lakshya nirdhaarit kiya tha lekin dukh kaa vishay he ki usne is baar to nau fisadi ke bare main sochna bhi band kar diya
 This time he 8
 2 fisadi kaa lakshya nirdhaarit kiya he, jabaki maujuuda vikaas kii dar 7
 9 percent
 gujarat kii vikaas dar hameshaa 11 fisadi ke upar hi rahi he
 0 only
 3 fisadi ke liye puure desh ko yahaan ikattha karne kii kya jarurat thi
 Overwhelmed by the respect at the party office, Modi also tried to energize the activists by saying that he spent significant years of his life in this office and it was the strength of the party organization that brought him from where he was
 unhone kaha ki kathor parishram kaa koi vikalp nahin hota
 With the support of the party organization and the workers, i have been able to do this work which will make the BJP workers feel proud and the party satisfied
 modi ke bhaashan ke dauraan modi pradhanmantri ke naare bhi lage
 On this occasion, BJP President Nitin Gadkari welcomed Modi and said that Modi has given a huge gift to BJP by winning for the third time in a row

 At the end, a spectator sat asking, "to what extent can an author be allowed to write Is it? "in response, director Shilpi went on to clarify," So much so that we can keep our motif and to add a little fresh reference to connect with it today
 iske vaise kai jawaab ho sakate hai lekin natya prastutiyon kaa ek makasad agar darshakon ke dimag main aasapaas kii visangatiyon ko lekar sawaal paidaa karnaa hota he to yah is naatak kii kamyaabi thi
 The mercury rolling below the tens of December evenings in Delhi has brought warmth to the theater
 pichley hafte chaar natya utsav ek saath chal rahe theah sahitya kala parishad kaa 5 yuva nirdeshkon par kendrit yuva nat ya samaaroh (kamaani sabhaagaar), panna bhartraam festival (shriram centre), sanjha sapana (altiji) or saptahanth main chalane vaala sukhmanch winter festival (lokkala manch)
 It was interesting to see that the audience had a substantial and positive presence in all the festivities
 yuva samaaroh ke udghaatan par nautanki style se prerit modern musical, mithileshwar likhit babuji (nirdeshak rajesh singh) main to sabhaagaar main 600 se zyada kii upasthiti thi
 a young child brought mother-in-law to the mother asking, "mummy! What is dancing called Babuji?" Despite being the first day of the week on December 24, directed by Nayana Sagar at the Sri Ram Center, a black comedy arsenic written by Joseph Keslering And the Old Lace got close to a hundred viewers
 unki charchaaon se lagata tha ki ve ise padhe yaa is par bani charchit film dekhe hue hai
 However, this was not a very rhythmic rendition of Sri Ram Center Repertory
 naatakon main darshakon ko aksar niraashaa milti he lekin agali baar phir ve ankhon main ek nayaa sapana lekar aa baithte hai
 At the Sanjha Sapna Utsav, when the opening process started to get a bit lengthy, some viewers started eagerly speaking, "dude, we have come to see the play
" ''baharhaal, kul kareeb 1,600 kii kshamta vaale chaar sabhagaaron main 4-5 din main 4,000 darshakon ne to naatak dekhe hi
 Apart from the groups involved in these festivals, this is also good news for other theater parties
 dilli metro ke kiraaya badhotaree ko lekar centre or dilli sarkaar ke bich anban jari he
 The Kejriwal government is opposing the hike in Metro fares and is threatening the agitation
 lekin kya vaaki kejariwal or unki sarkaar kaa virodh kiraaya badhaane kii manshaa ko lekar he yaa phir ye sab raajnneetik taur par metro ke musafiron kii sahanubhuti lene kaa ek stant maatr he
 Till date, there is a report of Delhi Metro's hiring committee, after reading this report and knowing its recommendations, many things are becoming clear, so that the current political hi-taaba can also be understood
 dilli sarkaar ko is baat kii pukhta jaankaree ab se thik ek saal pehle se hi thi ki metro kaa kiraaya kitna or kab se bad rahaa he
 Because the Rent Determination Committee submitted its report in September 2016
 jiske sadsy khud dilli sarkaar ke mukhya sachiv the
 Even if it is assumed that the Delhi government had opposed the fare increase, then how did the fare increase in May 2017 and then why there was no statement or letter from the government
 jabaki hakeekat ye he ki metro kiraye kii badhotaree kaa bada hissaa to may 2017 main hi lagu kar diya gaya tha
 Because the average 91 per cent increase was proposed, of which 51 per cent was increased only in May 2017, and now the uproar is happening on the remaining 27 per cent increase stage
 jo 10 oktober se lagu hona he
 How the common metro passenger was ignored and the arguments made by the committee about increasing the rent are surprising
 daleel di gai ki sarkari karmchaariyon kii tankhwaah badhane or nunatam mazdooree main badhotaree hui he, lekin samiti ne badi hi safagoi se un musafiron kaa paksh nazarandaaz kar diya jo in category main nahin aate
 Unemployment figures and the pockets of students studying in school and college were also not taken care of
 kis tarah se tay kiya gaya badha hua kirayachauthi kiraaya nirdhaaran samiti kaa gathan dilli metro ke liye nayaa kiraaya tay karne ke liye 2016 ko kiya gaya
 On 9 June 2016, the committee chairman retired Justice ML Mehta took charge
 unke alaava cameti main do sadsy or the, jisamen dilli sarkaar ke tatkaaleen mukhya sachiv keke sharma or kendriya shahari vikaas mantralay ke tatkaaleen edisnal secretary dies mishra shaamil the
 Mishra is now the secretary of the Ministry of Urban Development and as such he is also the chairman of Delhi Metro Rail Corporation
 2009 se lekar 2016 main cameti banane takimetro ke kirayemen badhotaree nahin hui thi
 Therefore, the committee recommends increasing the fares of the metro in two phases
 isamen pehle charan main 51 fisadi or duusare charan main 27 fisadi kiraaya badhegaa
 The Rent Determination Committee has also written in its report that the passengers of the Metro are able to afford the increased fare
 iske samarthan main metro kii fere phikseshan cameti ne kuch daleelein bhi di hai or tathy pesh kiye hai
 The committee wrote in the report, it was found that between 2009 and 2016, the industrial daily allowance increased by 95 percent
 kendriya karmchaariyon kaa dainik bhatta bhi 103 fisadi tak badha he
 According to the committee, the wages of unskilled, semi-skilled and skilled laborers have also gone up by 143, 158 and 166 per cent
 cameti kii report main is baat kaa bhi zikr he ki dilli sarkaar ne nunatam mazdooree main pachaas fisadi or centre sarkaar ne nunatam mazdooree main 43 fisadi kii badhotaree kii he
 On the basis of these facts, the committee concluded that the wages of the government employees have increased from the wages and hence they can pay the increased fare of the metro
 rashtriya or antarrashtriya sansthaaon ke udhaahrankiraaya badhaane ke peeche kiraaya nirdhaaran samiti ne ditisi kaa udhaaharan diya
 In which it has been said that due to not increasing the rent, the economic condition of DTC was diluted and DTC became a liability for the government
 yahi nahin antarrashtriya str par cameti ne washington metro kaa udhaaharan diya
 In which the Washington metro was closed for years because of no fare increase
 cameti ne kaha he ki agar dilli metro kaa kiraaya nahin badhaayaa gaya to dmarsi kii sehat ke liye ye acha nahin hoga

 What they (saints) will get from them? piem modi ne kaha, 'jab maine pramukh swami se yah kaha to vah bole, nahin, santon ko saamaajik vaastaviktaa ke bare main pataa hona chahie, kyonki unhen sahi disha main samaaj ke liye kaam karnaa he
 The Prime Minister also recalled Yogiji Maharaj, who brought the prominent Swami into the Swaminarayan Panth and said that Swami set an example of what a disciple should be like
 modi ne kaha, 'ham pramukh swami ko guru ke rup main jaanate hai
 But seeing them one can also understand what the disciple should be like
 ' unhone yaad kiya ki kis tarah pramukh swami ne dilli main yamuna nadi ke kinare akshardham mandir banaakar apane guru kii ichha puri kii
 Prime Minister Modi said, 'long time ago, while walking along the banks of river Yamuna, Yogiji had expressed his wish to build a temple on the banks of Yamuna in front of the chief swami

 The body of the Swami is kept in this temple
 piem modi ne kaha, 'aapmen se kai ne ek guru ko khoyaa hoga, lekin maine ek pita ko kho diya
 After speaking this line, he stopped for a minute to control his emotions

PM Modi said, 'when i told this to the chief Swami, he said, no, saints should know about the social reality, because they have to work for the society in the right direction
 ' pradhanmantri ne pramukh swami ko swaminarayan panth main laane vaale yogiji maharaj ko bhi yaad kiya or kaha ki swami ne ek udhaaharan tay kiya ki shishy kaisaa hona chahie
 Modi said, 'we know Pramukh Swami as Guru
 lekin unhen dekhakar koi yah bhi samaj saktaa he ki shishy kaisaa hona chahie
 'he recalled how the chief Swami fulfilled his guru's wish by building the Akshardham temple on the banks of the Yamuna river in Delhi
 pradhanmantri modi ne kaha, 'bahut samay pehle, yamuna nadi ke kinare tahaltey hue yogiji ne pramukh swami ke saamne yamuna ke tat par ek mandir banavaane kii ichha jataai thi
 This wish was expressed informally

 ' PM Modi said that Swami knew a lot about him through intuition
 unhone swami dwaara unhen dilli ke akshardham mandir main iske nirmaan ke samay bulaane kii ghatana yaad kii
