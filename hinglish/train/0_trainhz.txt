 2014 main narendra modi ke centre kii satta par kabiz hone ke baad se hi congress is koshish main juty he ki vipakshi dalon ko ekajute rakhaa jaae, uski ore se pehle yah koshish sonia gandhi kii ore se kii gai or ab rahul gandhi kii ore se kii ja rahi he
 Opposition solidarity was seen in the Bihar elections in 2015 when the 'grand Alliance' swept the Bharatiya Janata Party, before the newly fledged man party swept the Congress and BJP from power in Delhi with a clean sweep
 vipaksh ko ekajute kii koshish main congressgujarey 3-4 saalon main kai rajyon kii vidhansabha chunaavon main haar kaa saamana karne ke baad congress ek baar phir vipakshi ekta par jor dene lagi he or iske lierahul gandhikai kshetreey partiyon se sampark main hai
 For example, the Congress not only kept the BJP away from power but also kept itself in power by keeping young leaders Hardik Patel and Jignesh Mevani in Gujarat or by supporting the JDS, which is at number three in Karnataka
 kshetreey str par gathjod kaa phayda dekhte hue rahul gandhi trinmul bhi congress pramukh mamata banerjee, sapa pramukh akhilesh yadav, rashtriya lok dal netaa jayant choudhary,basapasupremeo mayawati or kai anya kshetreey netaaon se sampark sadhate rahe
 In spite of all this, Rahul Gandhi has not made any contact with Aam Aadmi Party and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal in the last 3 years
 donon ke bich duuri bani hui he
 The special thing is that both Rahul and Arvind are outspoken critics of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and are constantly attacking them, but there is no mutual solidarity between them
 pichley dinodervind kejarivalane apane 3 mantriyon ke saath alji anil baijal par centre ke ishaare par kaam karne kaa aarope lagaate alji offis main dharna dete hue khud ko band kar rakhaa tha
 The Congress did not support this movement of AAP
 jabaki kejariwal ko 4 mukhyamantriyon mamata banerjee, pi vijayan, chandrababu naidu or echdi kumaraswami kaa samarthan hasil hua
 Congress against Kejriwal: It is worth noting here that apart from Rahul Gandhi, what many other Congress leaders say about Kejriwal and Aam Aadmi Party
 rahul ne alji offis main kejariwal ke dharne par ek twit kiya tha jisamen unhone kejariwal or pradhanmantri narendra modi donon par nishaanaa saadhaa, lekin aap sarkaar ke centre ke khilaaf andolan kaa samarthan nahin kiya
 Apart from Congress President Ajay Makenne also continued his attack against Kejriwal and criticized him
 dilli keepurv mukhyamantrior congress kii varisht netaa shila dikshit ne bhi dharne par baithne vaale kejariwal ko naseehat di ki aisa karne se pehle unhen samvidhan padhanaa chahie
 Why distance from Kejriwal? Why is the Congress keeping a distance from Kejriwal and AAP party, while it has maintained an aggressive stance on BJP from Purjor
 kejariwal ne anna hajaare ke saath lokapal andolan kii shuruyaat karte hue congress or gandhi parivaar par jamkar hamalaa bolaa tha
 Kejriwal even went as far as 'unguided missile'
 congress or sonia gandhi ne kejariwal ko modi sarkaar ke khilaaf hamale ke liye yojit kisi bhi baithak main nimantrit nahin kiya he
 Like Sonia, Rahul has kept the same distance from Kejriwal
 pichley dinon karnataka main echdi kumaraswami ke mukhyamantri pad ke shapath grahan samaaroh main sonia or rahul ke saath-saath kejariwal ne bhi shirkat kii thi, lekin donon ke bich koi mulaakaat nahin hui
 The Congress's top leadership has called several other leaders, including Mamata Banerjee, Mayawati, Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister n Chandrababu Naidu for talks for opposition solidarity, but neither invited Kejriwal nor made any such attempt
 desh kii sabase puraani raajnneetik party ke liye aam aadmi party abhi bhi 'achhut' bani hui he
 Natsutra, a junior partner in Delhi, says that the Delhi leadership of the Congress does not want any kind of relationship with Kejriwal to be established
 congress ko lagata he ki aap sarkaar dilli main apana janaadhar kho rahi he
 AAP, which won 67 out of 70 seats in the assembly elections 3 years ago, is going to suffer a big loss
 congress apane puraane vot bank (muslim or dalit) par phir se apane paksh main karaane main juty he
 The Congress hopes that Muslims and Dalits will vote for him in the next election
 dilli main aglaa chunaav 2020 main hoga
 There is also a special thing that if the Congress contacts AAP and goes ahead with it, then it will have to remain as a junior partner in Delhi because AAP has dominance in Delhi
 congress pehle se hi kai rajyon main junior partner bani hui he
 It also has junior partner status in Bihar, Jammu and Kashmir, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh
 uttar pradesh main agar vah sapa or basapa ke saath kisi tarah kaa samjhauta karti he to uski bhoomika junior partner kii hi rahegi
 The upcoming election will change Surat! Meanwhile, the Congress hopes that it may gain and return to power in the assembly elections in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh at the end of the year
 in teenon hi rajyon main bijepi kii sarkaar he or use satta virdohi lahar kaa saamana karnaa pad saktaa he
 After returning to power in Punjab and improving its position in Gujarat, the confidence of the Congress, which has become a partner in power in Karnataka, has increased, it feels that its position will improve nationwide in the coming times
 2019 main loksabhaa chunaav se pehle 3 bade rajyon main hone vaale vidhansabha chunaav agar congress ke paksh main gaye to bijepi kii aguwai vaali endie ke khilaaf morcha kholane ko lekar uskaa aatmavishvaas badha hua hoga or vipakshi guton ko ekajute bhi banane main kaamyaab ho sakati he
 However, from the point of view of the Congress, the Aam Aadmi Party does not fit anywhere in this political equation and that is why Kejriwal's AAP party remains 'untouchable' for Rahul Gandhi

 Bharat Ratna is the 94th birthday of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee today
 teen baar desh ke pradhanmantri rahe vaajapeyi ek safal netaa hone ke saath hi ek kavi bhi rahe
 He always recited his poems in his speeches

 His collection of poems 'meri Equavan poems' is very popular among his supporters
 is maukey par pesh hai, unki chuninda kavitaayen
 1: You have to walk with steps, obstacles come, reduce the noise of the holocaust, embers under the feet, blow on the head if there will be flames, laughing in your hands, burning with fire
 kadam milakar chalanaa hoga
 In humor, in storms, if in innumerable sacrifices, in gardens, in valleys, in insults, in honors, advanced cows, raised chests, will have to flourish
 kadam milakar chalanaa hoga
 In Ujiyare, in darkness, tomorrow in Kahar, in the middle edge, in fierce hatred, in puta love, in momentary victory, in long defeat, the hundred centric charms of life will be cast
 kadam milakar chalanaa hoga
 If the path spread in front of it, pragati chirantan kaisa iti now, well-known joyous kaisa labor scourge, unsuccessful, successful common desire, giving everything and not asking for anything, will have to be molded
 kadam milakar chalanaa hoga
 a life adorned with some thorns, a youth deprived of intense love, Madhuban, enlightened with silence, devoted to his body, life will have to be burnt and burned
 qadam milakar chalanaa hoga
 Read that poem by Atal

 The superstar Amitabh Bachchan arrived as the chief guest at the launch of Shatrughan Sinha's book recently, on this occasion, Amitabh shared many wonderful things about Shatrughan
 aaie jaanate hai amitabh bachchan ne apane jamaane shandaar actor shatrughna ke bare main kya kaha:is khaas maukey par aap kya kahana chaahate hai?sabase pehle to main shatru (shatrughna) kaa aabhaar prakat karnaa chahta hum ki unhone mujhe aaj kitaab ke launch par aamantrit kiya he
 Was your Shatrughan Sinha Semulakatakab? When i came to join the industry to work in films, i met Shatrughan, he used to work in those days and we had come new, in that sense Seshatrughanme is senior, But maybe 4-5 years younger in age
 shatrughna ke bare main aap kya jaanate hai?inkaa jivan bada hi vicitra or adbhut rahaa he
 His family consists of Ram, Laxman, Bharat, Shatrughan, and when he bought a house in Mumbai, he also named it 'ramayana'
 kuch khaas baat aap share karnaa chaahate hai?hamaarifilm industrimen koi bhi aisa udhaaharan nahin he jahaan ek villen ke aane par taaliyaan bajati thim, lekin shatrughna sinha jab bhi screen par aate the, taaliyon kii gadgadaahat hoti thi
 This used to be a very special thing
 khalanaayak ke baad shatrughna nayak ban gaye or unhone nayak ke rup main bhi bahut sari khyaati arjeet kii
 Shatrughan Sinha went into politics too? Yes, villain then hero, then Shatrughan went into politics, he did a good job there too, there are very few examples and there is no one in my knowledge who has won his fame in every field
 Ho
 suna hashatrughnashooting ke liye hameshaa let pahunchate the?ji, ye shuru se hi aise the, kahin bhi jane ke liye inako vakt kii pabandi nahin thi
 Many times when we used to go to watch movies, we always used to reach 40 - 45 minutes late and due to these we were also delayed
 yahaan tak kii flite pakadaney ke dauraan bhi airport par karmchaaree log inhe khaas taur par bulaane aate the
 Have you heard that Shatrughan used to come on the sets when you left for shooting? Yes, i have heard the truth, the good thing was that he used to leave only after doing his work
 mujhe tajjub hota tha kii ham donon ek saath kaam ke liye nikalate the lekin ye hameshaa deree se hi pahunchate the, (hansate hue) naa jane kaha chale jaaya karte the
 Share a few on-set incidents? i remember when the shoot for 'bombay to Goa' was going on and Shatrughan was shot, he left and then my shoot was going on with Aruna Irani, we both dialed While speaking, suddenly a ring of smoke came between us and came to know that Shatrughan was smoking cigarette behind

 From inside the gurudwara, there was an echo of the Sabd being sung in the last Ardas

 a young man sitting in a black turban and white kurta-pajama under the shelter of business and politics veteran Gurugrantha Sahab was thrashing him

 monti ne yah bhale hi na sochaa ho lekin shaayad ponti ne apane bete ko gaddi saunpane kii taiyaari pehle hi kar lee thi
 In March this year, when Uttar Pradesh changed power, Ponty did not forget to take son Monty with him for the swearing-in ceremony of Akhilesh Yadav

 The presence of the leaders is enough to tell that the flowers that Ponty had decorated in the relationship are still blooming, but how the new garden will irrigate it depends on Monty's skill

 trump ne aise shaks ko apni cabinet main bada ohada diya jo ek rajaneta nahin balki duniya kii sabase badi tel company exonmobil kaa siio he
 Tillerson's relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin is well known

 One business leader was described as a successful international dealer leading a global operation

 inamen aise desh bhi shaamil hai jinke rishte america ke saath achche nahin hai
 It also goes in Tillerson's favor that he knows many veterans

 On behalf of Russia, Tillerson was given this honor for cooperation in the field of energy

 On Wednesday, amid reports that Tillerson would become America's next foreign minister, the Kremlin confirmed his relationship with Putin

 Tillerson's experience Tillerson, who had an engineering degree from the University of Texas in 1975, started his career with Exxon
 unhone exon ke america, rus or yaman ke oparations main kaam kiya
 Until the nineties, Tillerson watched all of Exxon's overseas campaigns
 unhone rus ke purvi tat par sakhalin tel or gas pariyojna main exon kii taraf se ahm bhoomika nibhaai thi
 3 of the discovery of oil in the Arctic province of Russia between Exxon and the Russian government company Rosneft

 Oil companies have to adopt very low balance diplomacy abroad and this is perhaps why Trump has chosen Tillerson as foreign minister

 The Supreme Court will also monitor and CBI will investigate, but the lack of means in CBI to investigate big cases like Vyapam remains a big question
 tippaniyan About ten days ago, CBI has taken this case in its hand and it has collected 40 officers from all over the country to investigate this scam
 lekin tamaam raajnneetik hangaame ke baavjood kaarywahi dhimi he
 The challenge for the CBI at present is whether or not it will be able to investigate all the cases because the officers are also falling short for the investigation of big cases like Vyapam
 ab tak sibiai ne is maamle main 13 exiar or paanch praathmik jaanch darj kii he, inamen namrata damor or akshay singh ke maamle shaamil hai
 But there are thousands of pages of documents before the CBI, 350 people have been arrested in this case, along with 185 more cases to be investigated
 ausatan saal main 1000 maamle darj karne vaali sibiai ke liye ye 20 fisadi kaam he
 The CBI is unable to find the means for this
 isse pehle sarada maamle main sibiai adaalat main kah chuki he ki sthaneey police kii madad ke bina ye jaanch nahin ho paaegi
 It is possible that in this case also the help of the city police should be taken
 sibiai ko tote kaa pinjadaa kahen yaa satta kaa ghulaam, ye abhi tak desh kii sabase mahatvapurn jaanch agency rahi he
 Probably, because every scandal is put on his already heavy shoulders, but the question is that if the CBI does not have the means of investigation, then it also becomes an escape route
 jaanch jari rahati he, aaropee azaad rahete hai

 This is 20 per cent work for the CBI, which has filed 1000 cases in an average year
 sibiai iske liye saadhan nahin juta paa rahi he
 Earlier in the Saradha case, the CBI has said in the court that without the help of the local police, this investigation would not be possible
 ho saktaa he, is maamle main bhi shahar ke police kii madad lee jaae
 Call the CBI a parrot cage or a slave of power, it has been the most important investigative agency of the country so far
 shaayad isliye har ghapala uske pehle se baari kandhon par daal diya jaataa he lekin sawaal ye he ki sibiai ke paas jaanch ke saadhan puure na hon to isse batch nikalne kaa rasta bhi ban jaataa he
 The investigation continues, the accused remain free
 anna hajaare ke anshan kaa aaj paanchvaan din he
 Addressing the supporters at Ramlila Maidan on the 5th day of his fast, Anna said that his weight has reduced by three and a half kilos, but he is not going to stop
 unhone phir kaha ki jan lokapal bill ko mukaam tak pahunchaa kar hi dam lenge
 Anna said that the country's treasury is not threatened by thieves, but also by its guards
 ramlila maidan main apane samarthakon se hajaare ne kaha, 26 janvari, 1950 ko ganraajya to bana, lekin desh kii janata nahin jaagi thi
 Now the public has woken up and we will continue with true freedom
 gauratlab he ki hajaare ne anshan kii shuruyaat 16 agast ko kii thi
 He undertook a 67-hour fast in Tihar Jail and has been fasting at Ramlila Maidan since Friday afternoon
 jan lokapal vidheyak ko paarit karne ke liye sarkaar ko 30 agast tak kaa antim samay de chuke hajaare ne kaha ki lokapal kaa mudda ek padaav he or yah ladaai jari rahegi
 We have to fight the next battle in favor of rejecting unacceptable candidates in elections and against government acquisition of agricultural land
 unhone kaha ki yah sarkaar bhi bhrashtachar ke kuchakr main funs chuki he
 We have to break this vicious cycle
 gandhivadi kaaryakarta ne kaha ki sarkari khajaane ko choron se nahin, usee ke paharedaaron se khatra he or desh ko dushmano se nahin bhrasht gaddaaron se khatra he
 He said that by seeing the youth on the fifth day of fasting, he is getting energy and he can fast for 8-10 days
 anna hajaare ke baad prasiddh saamaajik kaaryakarta medha patkar ne kaha ki desh ke kisaanon ko bhoomi adhigrahan nahin bhoomi adhikaar chahie or aglaa andolan isi mudde par hona chahie
 Earlier, Team Anna member Arvind Kejriwal told reporters that Anna is ready for talks whenever the government wants
 teen din anna kaa anshan tihaad jail main chalaa or shuukravaar yani chauthe din dopaher anna ramlila maidan main pahunche
 Ever since Anna arrived here, the number of his supporters has been steadily increasing
 haalanki shuukravaar shaam se ruk−ruk kar hui barish kai baar baadha bani, lekin samarthakon kaa utsaah kam nahin hua
 Throughout the night, Ramlila Maidan was roaring with patriotic songs
 anna ke anshan ke agle teen din behad ahm hai
 The next three days are off and in such a situation, there is a possibility of huge crowd at Ramlila Maidan
 jitani bheed shuukravaar din main thi usase zyada bheed raat main dekhne ko mili
 There were serious talk on Janlokpal, while thousands of people present there were singing on patriotic songs
 bich main ruk-ruk kar barish bhi hoti rahi, lekin log date rahe
 The crowd continued to grow, despite the rain the enthusiasm of the people did not cool down
 anna ne phir kaha ki unhen yuvaaon se ummid he, desh jaagruk ho chukaa he
 Team Anna member Arvind Kejriwal also spoke
 kejariwal ne centre sarkaar ko baheri sarkaar bataaya
 Prashant Bhushan spoke of a referendum on the Lokpal issue
 ye anshan kab tak chalegaa? kab tak anna kaa sharir unke iraadon kaa saath degaa? unka vajan 4 kilo kam ho chukaa he, lekin anna bephikr hai
 It is said that when the weight is reduced by 10 kg, then talk
 lekin ab sabaki nigaah darasal isi baat par he ki kya anna 15 din kaa anshan kar paaenge
 Anna claims that after 15 days a week and he can go on hunger strike

 jab ham kisi cheez ko upar phenkate he to vah neeche kyo aa jaati he
 Have you ever thought about it? gurutvkarshan kaa bal us cheez ko neeche khich letaa he
 So what is this gravity? How is it born? To know similar interesting questions, read about gravity: Newton's law of gravitation: The attraction force acting between any two objects is proportional to the product of mass of the object and the distance between them
 Is inversely proportional to the square
 mana do pind jinka dravyaman m1 evam m2 he, ek duusare se r duuri par sthit he, to newton ke niyam ke anusaar unke bich lagane vaala aakarshan bal, f = g m1m2 / R^2 hota he
 Where g is a constant called universal gravitational constant and 6
 67 x 10^-11 Nm^2 / kg^2 hota he
 Gravity: According to Newton's gravity, an attraction force acts between two bodies
 yadi inamen se ek pind prithvi ho to is aakarshan bal ko gurutv kehete hai
 That is, gravity is the attraction force through which the earth pulls an object towards its center
 is bal ke kaaran jo twaran utpann hoti he, use gurutv janit twaran (g) kehete hai, jinka maan 9
 8 m / s ^ 2
 gurutv janit twaran (g) vastu ke rup, aakaar, dravyaman aadi par nirbhar nahin karata he
 Changes in the value of g: i) The value of g decreases when it goes above or below the surface of the earth
 ii)'g' kaa maan mahattam prithvi ke dhruv (pole) par hota he
 iii) The value of 'g' is at the minimum equator
 iv)prithvi kii ghurnan gati badhane par 'g' kaa maan kam ho jaataa he
 v) The value of 'g' increases as the Earth's rotation speed decreases
 note:yadi prithvi apni vartmaan koniya chaal se 17 guni adhik chaal se ghoomane lage to bumadhya rekha par rakhi hui vastu kaa bhaar shunya ho jayega
 Weight of a body in lift: i) When the lift moves up, the weight of the body in the lift appears to be increased
 ii)jab lift neeche kii ore jaati he to lift main sthit pind kaa bhaar gata hua prathit hota he
 iii) When the lift moves up or down at the same velocity, there does not seem to be any change in the weight of the body in the lift
 iv)yadi neeche utarate samay lift kii dori tut jaae to vah mukt pind kii bhaanti neeche girti he
 In such a situation, the weight of the body in the lift is zero
 yahi bharaheenta kii sthati he
 v) If the acceleration of the lift is higher than the gravitational acceleration while descending, the body in the lift will rise from its floor and go from its roof
 graho kii gati sambandhit kepler kaa niyam:i)prayek grah surya ke chaaron ore dirghavrittakar (eliiptical) kaksha main parikrama karata he tathaa surya grah kii kaksha ke ek focus bindu par sthati hota he
 ii) The regional velocities of each planet are fixed
 iskaa prabhaav yah hota he ki jab grah surya ke nikat hota he, to uskaa veg bad jaataa he or jab vah dur hota he, to uskaa veg kam ho jaataa he
 iii) The period of time a planet orbits around the Sun is called its rotation period (T)
 parikraman kaal kaa varg (T^2) grah kii surya se ausat duuri (r) ke ghan (r^3) ke anukramanupati hota he
 That is, t ^ 2 ∝ r ^ 3 means that the planets far away from the Sun also have a longer rotation period
 udhaaharan: surya ke nikatatam grah budh kaa parikraman kaal 88 din he, jabaki duurastha grah varun (neptune) kaa parikraman kaal 165 varsh he
 Note: IAU (I
 A
 U
 ) ne yama (PLUTO) ke grah kii shrenee se nikaal diya he isliye ab duurastha grah varun he
 Satellite: a body orbiting around a planet is called a satellite of that planet
 jaise chandramaa prithvi kaa upgrah he
 Orbital speed of satellite: i) The satellite's orbital speed depends on its elevation from the earth plane
 upgrah prithvi tal se jitna dur hoga, utani hi uski chal kam hogi
 ii) The orbital speed of a satellite does not depend on its mass
 ek hi trigya ke kaksha main bhinn-bhinn dravyamanon ke upgrahon kii chaal samaan hogi
 Note: The orbital speed of a satellite orbiting very close to the Earth plane is about 8 km
 / second hoti he
 Orbital speed of a satellite: The time the satellite orbits an orbit of the earth in its orbit, it is called its orbital period, hence the rotation period = circumference / orbital speed of the orbit i) The rotation period of the satellite is also only its earth
 The altitude from the ground depends on the distance and the farther away the satellite is, the higher its rotation period
 ii)upgrah kaa parikraman kaal uske dravyaman par nirbhar nahi karata he
 Note: On a satellite orbiting very close to the Earth, the rotation period is 1 hour 24 minutes
 bhu-sthaayee upgrah (geo-stationary satellite):aisa upgrah jo prithvi ke aksh ke lambavat tal main pashchim se purv kii ore prithvi kii parikrama karata he tathaa jiskaa parikraman kaal prithvi ke parikraman kaal (24 ghante) ke baraabar hota he, bhu-sthaayee upgrah kehalaata he
 This satellite is about 36000 km above the Earth level
 kii oonchai par rahakar prithvi kaa parikraman karata he
 The possibility of establishing a communications satellite in geosynchronous orbit was first expressed by Author C
 Clarke
 palaayan veg (escape velocity):palaayan veg vah nunatam veg he jisase kisi pind kii prithvi kii sataha se upar kii ore phenke jane par vah gurutveey kshetra ko paar kar jaataa he, prithvi par vaapis nahin aata
 Value of migration velocity to Earth 11
 2 km / s he yani ki prithvi tal se kisi vastu ko 11
 If thrown in any direction above a velocity of 2 km / s or more, the object will not return to the earth plane again
 upgrah ke liye kakshiya veg Vo = √gre tathaa prithvi tal se palaayan veg Ve = √2gre' atah Ve = √2vo yani ki palaayan veg kakshiya veg kaa √2 (yani ki 41%) badha diya jaae to vah upgrah apni kaksha ko chhodkar palaayan kar jayega
 According to a recent survey, Kendriya Vidyalaya located at iit-madras Campus in Chennai has got the status of the best government school in the country

 Chikungunya has worsened the situation in the city

 The title of this article may be decided in two ways
 pehla: haa, main daaud se mila tha or main aatankwaadi nahin hum
 And another: i am a very journalist, and my name is not Vedic
 ab aaie, in donon se baari-baari se nibatate hai
 In order to speak on the former title, full disclosure has to be made
 jaise, main jaranel singh bhindranvaale se dedh darjan baar mila
 i have met Laldenga, Muivah, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, Qazi Hussain Ahmad, General Mirza Aslam Baig (the then Emir of Jamaat Islami of Pakistan and then the head of the army)
 chunki yah meri sweekaarokti he, to yah bhi bataata chaluun ki main ek trek main mohammad taahir-ul-kadri (islamabad par kabje ke liye kukhyat) ke saath ek pradarshan main gaya tha jahaan utsaah main hamaare chaaron ore clashnicove rif len hawa main laharaai ja rahi thim
 i have also met Vilupillai Prabhakaran, i have also spoken to two heads of the ISI, and i was fortunate enough to meet a distinguished and strong-looking suitbutted gentleman in the elevator of a Geneva hotel whose personality is as if a military man
 Wrote but Pataudi on the nose
 ve major general af sandayar pataudi the, hamaare apane tiger pataudi ke chachere bhai or saf ali khan ke chachaa, jo us vakt iesai main duusare number par hua karte the
 Now, in the kind of 'patriotic' atmosphere that we have here today, how would i give good cleaning to these daredevils? And see my 'cowardice' that could not even take advantage of that opportunity enough? So what would i do now? Would i have snatched an AK rifle from one of Bhindranwale's crooks and shot it or handed it over to the people? Or would i have turned Muivah and Laldenga into loyal Indians or wringed their necks with my hands like Sunny Deol? And then would i be expected to turn down the meeting with the murdered Mujahideen commander and finally report it to the government after that surprise meeting in Geneva lift? But where should i report this? Whom should i report in my government? i report to my readers
 jitna main vaidic jaise vidwaan (jaruri nahin ki meri nigaah main hon, lekin ve sambhavat: khud ko aisa hi maanate hai) ko jaanata hum, zyada sambhaavna yahi he ki ve achaanak mili is prasiddhi se foole nahin samaa rahe honge
 In the process, however, our collective decision-making has fallen prey to intellectual bankruptcy which has exposed us as a cynical, insincere, obscene, ignorant, immature or simply, a foolish nation

 For example, did the Indian High Commission arrange this meeting? If that were indeed the case, then our Indian High Commissioner should be the most highly accessible diplomat to date, provided Saeed has also been an RAW agent twice
 baharhaal, vaidic ne said se kya baat kii? agar aap vaidic ko jaanate hai to kah sakate hai ki unhone shaayad koi baat nahin kii
 It is very likely that he has spent all the time of the meeting to explain how he is a self-styled and eminent diplomat and peacekeeper and that he has given the services of Benazir Bhutto, Asif Ali Zardari, Nawaz Sharif, Hamid Karzai, Rajiv Gandhi, p

 What he said to Narasimha Rao and Atal Bihari Vajpayee and how Barack Obama might have confessed to him that Vedic ji, i wish! i would accept your advice
 
 
 
 Vedic's old interviews are being conducted in which he is making a revolutionary statement, including Kashmir's independence, for it
 to kya vaidic ne bharat ke hiton se samjhauta kar liya? kya waapas laut kar is bare main unhone adhikariyon ko brif kiya? kya unhone muridake ke jeepies koordinates ko apane smartphone par fries kar diya tha? kya unhone said ko kashmir kii peshkash kii?main bas itnaa kahuunga ki agar unhone vaaki aisa kiya hoga to said ne dhanyavad sahit unki peshkash sweekaar lee hogi or jeet kaa jashn manaane ke liye apane vafaadaaron ke saamne takreer kar rahaa hoga: baiyrakon main laut jaao, bhai vaidikaji ne hamen kashmir tohfe main de diya he
 And then as far as i think, it will come off our shoulders, but will come out of our circles
 aap jaanate hai ki yah sab main bahut gambhir hokar nahin kah rahaa hum
 But as the atmosphere of surreal patriotism remains in this country, when pushing 'lord' Ravinder Jadeja up the steps of Trent Bridge, English pacer Jimmy Anderson suddenly becomes India's enemy number one, where our entire sense of humor comes from Kapil Sharma's comedy If the knights and Navjot Singh's puritanism have been confined, then it is better to keep everything from foolishness
 aakhir aap agali raat prime time kaa star yaa braking news kaa vishay bananaa nahin chahenge ki bakaul ek sampadak, vaidic kii said ko kii gai kashmir kii peshkash thik he, kam-se-kam isi bahaane said se hamaara peechha to chhutegaa

 haalanki maine bhi ek baar aisa hi kiya tha jab 26 / 11 ke baad paidaa tanaavpurn maahaul main ek pakistani tivi ankar ne phone saakshaatkaar par taane maarthe hue mujhase poocha tha ki arundhati roy chunki pehle hi kah chuki hai ki kashmir ko pakistan ko de diya janaa chahie, to is par aapako kya kahana he
 Then i had said very seriously to get rid of me that if this is the case then take Kashmir from them because obviously they are more prestigious and better writers than me
 aisa kah kar main batch niklaa tha
 Still, this week's debate will have to be left at some serious point

 This fall of public discourse in India is now coming for 15 years, it was probably only after Kargil that we journalists were inflated as 'force multipliers' and we were happy to have such certificates of power Started taking ek baar phir isaki pratidhwani 2001 main tab sunai di jab un sampadakon par rashtravaadi hamale kiye gaye (mujh samet) jinhone puri vinamrata se agra main parvej musharraf ke saath naashtaa kiya jabaki kashmir par bharat ke paksh ko unhone vahaan khaarij kar diya tha

 Okay, that was an election idiom for Modi but where did we journalists say anything in support of our right to listen, ask questions, bring stories? Where could we say that our job is not to fight like diplomats or soldiers? This time the only difference is that the shoes are the same, just the feet have changed because Vedic is close to the Sangh Parivar
 yahaan ham is lekh ke duusare sambhavit sheershak par baat kar sakate hai: ki main ek adad patrkaar hum, or meraa naam vaidic nahin he
 i am saying this because the concession that a certain journalist has got for meeting, talking, eating with anyone, even if it is the most dangerous enemy of the country, you do not get that concession on your own

 The Delhi Police has filed a chargesheet in the court today against the four accused in the case of chasing Union Minister Smriti Irani
 gyaat ho ki chaaron aaropee dilli vishvavidhyalay ke student hai

 police ne aaj patiala house court main chargeshit daakhil kii, jis par court ne sangyaan bhi le liya he
 Now the court will next hear the matter on October 15
 police ne apni chargeshit main bataaya he ki aaropee lagaataar kis tarah se smriti irani kaa peechha kar rahe the
 The police have mentioned Irani's statement and incident in his chargesheet
 rajdhani main ek nami abhinetri or kendriya mantri kaa peechha kiye jane kii is ghatana ne sabhi ko chaunkaa diya tha, saath hi rajdhani main aam mahilaon kii suraksha ko lekar sawaal bhi khadaa karne vaala he
 Let us know that this incident happened on April 1 last year
 yah he puraa maamlachargeshit ke mutabik, ek april 2017 kii raat DU ke chaar chaatro ne sharaab ke nashe main na sirf smriti irani kii car kaa peechha kiya, balki unhen ashleel ishaare bhi kiye

 The Indian Air Force AN-32 aircraft went missing 35 minutes after taking off from Assam on Monday
 vimaan main 13 log savaar the or yah arunachal pradesh kii ore ja rahaa tha
 Transport work was being done by this aircraft which had left for the Advanced Landing Ground at Mechuka, Arunachal
 mechuka china se sate arunachal ke siyang jile kaa ek chota sa shahar he
 Many state-of-the-art aircraft are employed to find it
 yahaan tak ki isro bhi aage aayaa he lekin airforce ke haath ab tak koi suraag nahin lag paaya he
 Three years ago in 2016, an aircraft of the same fleet (AN-32) went missing over the Bay of Bengal
 uski talaashi main bhi har wo jatan kiye gaye jo sena kar sakati thi magar afsos ki uskaa malba abhi tak nahin mil paaya he
 The question then arises that the incident of 2016 was in the Bay of Bengal where there is a possibility of extinction of an aircraft in the vast watershed but yesterday's case is of Arunachal where there is neither a sea gulf nor immense water
 phir vimaan krash hua to uskaa malba kahaan gaya?abhi is sawaal par manthan jari he
 Meanwhile an information came out that the missing aircraft was not an upgrade
 yani uskaa software usee puraani takanic par chal rahaa tha jaisi takanic use kharidte vakt mili thi
 In such a situation, the apprehension has become strong that the aircraft has lost its way due to technical disturbances
 He had to go to Arunachal but did he leave somewhere else? However, the army is engaged in solving these clues and it should be assumed that till the wreckage of the aircraft is found, it cannot be put in the category of crash
 kab suljhegi apgredation kii gutthitraasadee or dukh kii is ghadi main apgredation kaa sawaal uthaanaa sahi na ho magar log besabri se yah jaananaa chaahate hai ki air transport ke itihaas main kai kartab dikhaane vaala een-32 kya apgrade or takanic kii maar kaa shikaar ho gaya? aankade kuch aisa hi bayaan karte hai
 a fleet of AN-32 aircraft was purchased in 1980 from Russia (the then Soviet Union)
 isamen kul 105 vimaan hai
 It was also recorded in the deal that Russia would upgrade its technology
 2009 tak vimaan sahi udate rahe lekin usee saal bharat ne een-32 ke apgredation ke liye rus ke saath ek yojana aage badhaai
 On the condition of anonymity, a defense expert told that there was a $ 400 million agreement between India and Russia
 iske tahat rus ko vimaanon kaa apgredation karnaa tha, jisase unki udne kii kshamta 40 saal tak bad jaati
 In that agreement, the technology of 46 aircraft was also upgraded but most of the aircraft remained unused
 assam ke jorhat main jo een-32 vimaan laapata hua he vah bhi apgrade nahin tha
 The implication of Russia and Ukraine is that if 46 aircraft are upgraded then why are the others deprived of it? This happened because the break-up of the Soviet Union led to the partition of Russia and the task of upgrading went to Ukraine
 media main kahin-kahin yah bhi jaankaree he ki een-32 ke spair parts rus ke paas hai jabaki isaki dizin kii takanic ukraine ke paas
 Now, the question raised before India is whether it goes with Russia or Ukraine
 in donon deshon kii dushmani main bharat kaa kaam kharaab hua
 On the other hand, russia-ukraine battled with each other and waited for AN-32 upgrade
 yah silsilaa lagbhag abhi tak jari he
 Case for updation a report by 'the Hindu' states that the issue of upgradation of AN-32 has almost been resolved
 isaki jaankaree ukraine sthit antonov state corporation ke pramukh ne 'da hindu' ko di
 AN-32 aircraft are manufactured by Antonov Company itself
 antonov ke president olexander donets ke mutabik ukraine een-32 ke sabhi parts agle 2 saal main bharat ko supplai kar degaa
 Now it depends on India how fast it is able to upgrade the aircraft
 ukraine ne bharat ko een-32 vimaanon kii jagah een-132 vimaanon kaa bedaa dene kaa bhi prastaav diya he

 The arrest of five intellectuals in this case has created a stir across the country
 inaki giraftaar ke saath hi soshal media par ‘urban naksal’ shabd trend karne laga
 In such a situation, the question is how and where did the word 'urban Naxal' originated
 naksaliyon kii pairvi karte rahe hai buddhijiviyun to naksalwad par shuru se bahes hoti rahi he
 Many intellectuals have been advocating Naxalites
 abhi tak ye naksali desh ke gaanvon yaa phir aisi jagahon par pair pasaarte rahe hai jahaan na to sarkari system kii pahunch hoti he or na hi surakshabalon kii
 That is, they have been quietly establishing their roots in villages far from the city
 daliton-adivaasiyon kii aawaaj buland karne or unhen haq dilaane ke naam par ye chupchaap apane napak mansoobon ko puraa karne main jute hai
 Manure-water has also been given to this dangerous thinking through various means
 cheharaa-mohara hi nahin thikaana bhi badlaalekin pichley kuch samay se ek nayaa trend dekha ja rahaa he, jo behad ghaatak he
 In the past, some such evidence has been found in the hands of the police, which shows that not only the face and face of Naxalism has changed, but their whereabouts have also changed
 ye ab gaanvon se nikalakar shaharon main bhi apni paith bana rahe hai
 The director of the Urban Naxal, explained in the book, is a director, Vivek Agnihotri has recently written a book, titled 'urban Naxal'
 mana ja rahaa ki is kitaab ke sheershak ke baad 'urban naksal' trend kar rahaa he
 The book was released by Union Minister Smriti Irani on May 27 this year
 is dauraan irani ne kaha tha ki ek research main paaya gaya he ki duniya main maujuud kam se kam 21 aise sanghathan hai jo bharat main shikshavidon kii shakl main logon ko bhejte hai jo maowad kaa adhyayan kar apane desh laut jate hai
 Along with supporting Maoism, they also take care of their funding
 irani ne 21 sanghathanon kaa zikr to kiya, lekin unhone ye nahin bataaya ki ye sanghathan kahaan se jude hai or ve kis research ke aadhaar par ye baat kah rahi hai
 Vivek Agnihotri explained this term in an article in 2017, before launching his book on 'urban Naxal', 'urban Naxal'
 ‘urban naksal’ shabd ke arth or isaki avadharana ke bare main gaharaai se bataate hue vivek ne likhaa ki ye desh ke ek tarah se 'adrishy dushman' hai
 Many of them have been caught, while some are on the police radar for spreading rebellion
 in sabhi main ek baat kaaman he, jo behad khatarnaak he
 It has been seen that all these are urban intellectuals or activists
 in shahari naksaliyon kii uplabdhiyon se ek andaja lagaaya ja saktaa he ki ye sabhi saamaajik muddon ke prati chintit hone kaa naatak karte hai
 Also affect the youth
 chaatro ko banaate hai nishaanavivek kehete hai, meraa maananaa he ki ye kabhi bhi saamaajik samasyaon kaa samaadhaan khojane kii koshish nahin karte hai
 Such people only gather the public and try to take advantage of themselves or the party through protests
 ye log chaatro ko vibhinn collejon main admician lene ke liye protsaahit karte hai
 At the same time, to stay longer in the college campus, it is also said to try tricks like failing
 do tarah ke intelexualavivek agnihotri ne kaha ki is desh main do tarah ke intelexual yani bauddhik varg he
 The first intellectuals are those who are right-minded
 in logon main garmi or dhul se pareshaan rahane vaale, bhartiya sabhyataa kii aadhyatmik paramparaon ko upar rakhane vaale, jati vyavastha main yakeen na karne vaale or jinke liye hindutv kaa matlab anya dharmon, khaskar isai or islam kaa virodh karnaa he
 The other intellectuals are those who are urban naxals
 ye bahurashtriya enjio jaisi sansthaaon vaale nexs kaa hissaa hai
 The most dangerous is that these people are part of the force that breaks India
 vivek agnihotri isse pehle saal 2016 main 'buddha in e trephic jam' film bhi bana chuke hai
 In this film too, he featured Urban Naxalites
 sarkaar kii manshaa par vipaksh ne uthaae sawaljis tarah se paanch buddhijiviyon ko giraftaar kiya gaya, us par vipaksh ne sawaal uthaate hue sarkaar par aarope lagaae hai
 The opposition claims that the government is suppressing the voice of those who work for the poor and the tribals
 haalanki vipaksh kaa kahana he ki naksali jo hinsa karte hai, wo uskaa samarthan nahin karte
 Manmohan Singh has also told that the great danger is former Prime Minister Dr
 manmohan singh ne bhi naksalwad ko desh ke liye bada khatra bataaya tha
 In October 2009, as Prime Minister Manmohan Singh admitted that the biggest threat in the country is from Naxalite forces and the kind of success expected against them has not been found
 unhone kaha tha ki khatra abhi tala nahin he
 Manmohan Singh had then said that the growth of Naxalites in central India is a matter of concern, this problem is most for the tribals
 naksaliyon kaa majboot hona vikaas kii raftaar ko roak saktaa he, ham vikaas karne kii koshish kar rahe hai
 But some groups or people have no right to take the law into their own hands

 badalte lifestil main in dinon online shopping kaa chalan bad gaya he
 Along with the big cities, online stores have also spread their wings in Tier II cities
 kharidari ke prati is badalte or badhate rujhaan ke peeche ek bada kaaran mobile or smartphone par internet connactivity bhi he
 But amidst all this, a major problem is coming up about secure transactions during shopping
 asuraksha kaa alam yah he ki kai baar order book hue bina paison kaa bhugtan ho janaa yaa order book hone ke baad bhi product kaa nahin milanaa aam baat ho gai he
 However, a little caution on this side can relieve us from these problems
 kya karen, kya naa karen-1) sabase pehle to online shopping ke dauraan yah baat ganth baandh len ki kisi bhi surat main apane credit card yaa acount detail ko email, post yaa soshal media ke jariye share naa karen
 2) Generally retailers do not ask for birth date or social security number etc
 So never disclose it
 3) order place karne se pehle delivery adress, phone number aadi kii jaanch kar len
 4) After making a purchase, logout from your account on the online retailer's website
 5) apane smartphone, laptop yaa mike ko apadet rakhen taaki virus or malware aadi se suraksha ho sake
 6) Use strong password for more security
 7) sabhi acount ke liye ek hi password kaa istemaal nahin karen
 8) Change the password of the account from time to time
 9) agar aapane retailor kii website par apane email yaa soshal media acount se login kiya he to logout jarur karen
 10) If possible, create a separate email ID for online shopping
 11) kabhi bhi kharidari ke liye public wi-fi yaa public caputer kaa istemaal nahin karen
 12) If shopping from a smartphone, then use mobile cellular data only
 13) behatar hoga agar aap online kharidari ke liye alag broujar kaa istemaal karen
 That is, during internet browsing, open a different browser while shopping
 14) broujar kii history, cache, or password aadi ko delit kar den
 15) Do the research at your online retailer before purchasing
 in dinon internet par kai phek retailor bhi maujuud hai
 16) Please read the product review on the retailer website before purchasing the product
 isse retailor ke bare or uski sarvice ke bare main bhi jaankaree mil jaaegi
 17) In the URL panel of the browser, notice the green lock and https before the URL
 iskaa arth he ki aap sicyor website par browjing kar rahe hai
 18) Always use Bayer Protection during payment
 19) agar pement ke dauraan OTP yani van time password kaa opshan he to isi kaa prayog karen
 20) Although the option of reminder password makes it easy for you to shop next time during the use of credit card or debit card, but it is better if you do not use it
 21) smartphone se shopping kar rahe hai to phone main PIN lock kaa istemaal jarur karen
 22) Delete the browser history and cache even while using the smartphone
 23) smartphone se kharidari ke dauraan bluetooth ko of rakhen
 24) Do not use public wi-fi for shopping from smartphones at all
 25) pement karne se pehle ek baar total ko calculate kar len
 26) Do not assume that your favorite retailer will always give you the right deal
 kuch bhi kharidne se pehle alag-alag website par deal kii tulana kar len
 27) After selecting the product, talk to the retailer's customer care and get all the information about the product, then buy only
 28) order place karne ke baad phone par massej or email par mail jarur check karen, agar koi dikkat ho to retailor ke customer care se jarur baat karen
 29) If something is not understood during the placing of the order and payment, then proceed only after contacting customer care
 30) yadi pement ke dauraan net conection fail ho jaae yaa order puraa na hon yaa pement getwe bich main atak jaae to fouran retailor website se sampark kar clem karen

 melbern or bristben main haar ne team india ke fens ko maayoos kar diya he
 After the results of the match of Malburn Cricket Ground and Brisbane's Gaba, many fans have already started raising questions about the team's World Cup results, but consider these matches as part of the team's World Cup preparations
 Which raises expectations from the team
 bristben main england ke kilaaf vanade match main stuart binni kii pari ko fans shaayad isliye lambey samay tak yaad nahin rakhaa, kyonki is match main team india ko karaari shikast kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 But Binny and his supporters will remember this because he proved to be the best player of Team India in the match
 coach dancan flechar is baat par jor dete rahe hai ki in halaat main team ko ek aise batting ol rounder kii zarurat he jo madhyam tej gendbaazi bhi kar sake
 According to him, such a player will not only strengthen the batting of the team and can also increase the strength of the team by becoming an extra bowler
 bristben main binni in donon hi role main khare utre hai
 This only match cannot be considered as a proof of his ability nor can he be considered the exact answer to the needs of the team, but in Brisbane, Stuart Binny scored the most 44 runs and got the only wicket from Team India
 purv test cricketer madanlaal or sunil joshi jaise jaankaar kehete rahe hai ki yah team ke captain par nirbhar karata he ki wo binni kii istemaal kaise karte hai
 When captain Dhoni tried him at number seven, he did not disappoint the team and he proved his importance even during bowling
 captain emes dhoni kehete hai, 'hamen dekhnaa hoga ki ham unka behtareen istemaal kaise karte hai
 They are definitely bowlers who can swing
 toornament ke agle maichon se ye saafe ho jayega ki wo nae gend kaa istemaal kaise karte hai or isse hamen ek acha vikalp mil jayega
 ' world cap main kamyaabi ke liye team india ko ek umdaa olerounder kii zarurat he, jo team india kii multi tasking ke liye har role main fit baith jaae
 Perhaps Binny can emerge as such a player
 team kii haar ke baavjood binni kaa pradarshan captain dhoni or team management ke liye raahat kii baat ho sakati he kyonki team ke paas aage kii planning ke liye ek behatar vikalp miltaa ja rahaa he
 It is obvious that Binny will also be looking for similar opportunities in the future and the team and fans will continue to expect better performances from him

 He also criticized such countries (western countries) of the world, who want to keep nuclear technology limited to themselves
 gutnirpeksh andolan ke 16wein shikhar sammelan kaa udghaatan karte hue khamnei america par jamkar barase
 He said that America is misusing the United Nations to bully the world
 unhone kaha, "islamic republic of iran parmaanu evam rasinic hathiyaaron ke istemaal kaa virodh karata he or ise akshamya paap ke rup main dekhtaa he
 We have given a slogan to make the Middle East free of nuclear weapons and we are committed to it
 " Khamnai said, "but this does not mean that Iran will give up its right to use nuclear power for peaceful purposes
 antarrashtriya niyamon ke anusaar, naagarik parmaanu praudyogiki kaa istemaal duniya ke sabhi deshon ke liye sahi he
 Everyone should get the right to use this safe energy in the context of different objectives for their country
 " He said that some Western countries have nuclear weapons, but they want to limit the ability to produce nuclear fuel on their own
 unhone kaha, "isaki sabase badi bidambana america prashasan he, jiske paas vyapak vinaash ke sabase adhik or sarvaadhik ghaatak parmaanu tathaa anya hathiyaar hai, vah ekmaatr desh he jo inke istemaal ko lekar patibaddh he
 But today he is raising the flag against nuclear proliferation
 "tippaniyan Khamnai also accused the United States of using the United Nations to serve its interests
 unhone kaha, "sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad kii sanrachana puri tarah ataarkik, anuchit tathaa aloktantric he
 This is a clear form of dictatorship, which has become very old and useless and the period of its termination has passed
 " He said, "america and its allies defend the interests of the West in the name of protecting 'human rights'
" ve 'loktantr' ke naam par duusare deshon main sainya hastkshep karte hai or 'aatankwaad se ladane' ke naam par vibhinn deshon ke gaanvon tathaa shaharon main bam va hathiyaaron se nirih logon ko nishaanaa banaate hai
 " unhone duniya ke aise deshon (pashchimi desh) kii aalochana bhi kii, jo parmaanu praudyogiki ko apane aap tak simit rakhana chaahate hai
 Inaugurating the 16th summit of the non-aligned Movement, Khamenei lashed out at the US
 unhone kaha ki america duniya par dhauns jamaane ke liye sanyukt raashtra kaa durupyog kar rahaa he
 He said, "the Islamic Republic of Iran opposes the use of nuclear and chemical weapons and sees it as an unpardonable sin
 hamane madhya-purv ko parmaanu hathiyaar mukt banane kaa naaraa diya he or ham iske prati patibaddh hai
 " khamnei ne kaha, "lekin iskaa matlab yah nahin he ki iran shantipurna uddeshyon ke liye parmaanu urja ke istemaal kaa apana haq chhod degaa
 According to international regulations, the use of civil nuclear technology is right for all countries of the world
 har kisi ko apane desh ke liye vibhinn uddeshyon ke sandarbh main is surakshit urja ke istemaal kaa adhikaar milanaa chahie
 " unhone kaha ki kuch pashchimi deshon ke paas parmaanu hathiyaar hai, lekin ve parmaanu eendhan utpaadit karne kii kshamta ko apane aap tak simit kar lenaa chaahate hai
 He said, "its biggest irony is the US administration, which has the most and most lethal nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction, is the only country committed to its use
" lekin aaj vahi parmaanu prasar ke khilaaf jhanda uthaae hue he
 "comments khamnei ne america par apana hit saadhane ke liye sanyukt raashtra ke istemaal kaa aarope bhi lagaaya
 He said, "the structure of the United Nations Security Council is completely irrational, unfair and undemocratic

 BJP separates itself from Mumbai mayoral election; BJP does not have enough figures in the corporation
 Shiv Sena has appointed 34 councilors in Mumbai's resort
 The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Shiv Sena coalition seems to have almost come to a complete stop, so its impact on local body elections too
 Can be seen nasik main bijepi ko dar he ki uske parshadon par shivasena-congress-ensipi gathjod send laga saktaa he
 This is the reason why BJP has moved all its councilors to a resort in Sindhgarh, 600 km from Nashik
 nasik municipal korporation par bijepi kaa qabja he
 The party is to elect its mayor on 22 November
 shivasena bhi is maamle main jokhim nahin lenaa chaahati
 Therefore, Shiv Sena has also moved its 34 councilors to a hotel near Mumbai
 122 sadasyeey nasik municipal korporation main bijepi ke paas 65 parshad hai
 Earlier BJP had 67 councilors but due to the resignation of two, the number came down to 65
 bijepi ke liye pareshaani kii vajahaye bhi he ki uske 12 parshad sindhugarh main resort nahin pahunche or unka koi ata-pataa nahin chal rahaa
 The Nashik Municipal Corporation has 34 councilors of Shiv Sena, 6 of Congress, 6 of NCP and 5 of MNS
 korporation main 5 nirdaleey / anya parshad bhi hai
 Sensing the chance of a BJP coup in the Satyam Municipal Corporation, which came to the ncp-shiv Sena, the NCP announced its support to the Shiv Sena
 ensipi ke pravaktaa nawab malik ne india today se kaha, ham bijepi ko nasik or anya municipal korporation kii satta se baahar rakhane ke liye shivasena ko samarthan karenge
 However, the final decision will be taken only after taking the Congress into confidence
 mumbai meyar chunaav se bijepi ne khud ko kiya alagais bich, bijepi ne saaf kiya he ki wo brihnmumbai municipal korporation (biemasi) main meyar pad kaa chunaav nahin ladegi
 This election is to be held on 22 November
 bijepi netaa manoj kotak ne india today tivi ko somvaar ko bataaya, “bijepi kii ore se shivasena ke kilaakhmer kaa ummidavaar nahin khadaa kiya jayegakhyonki hamaare paas korporation main aankade nahin he
 When asked about the possibility of support for the Shiv Sena candidate, Manoj Kotak said that the party is yet to take a decision on the issue
 '2022 main bijepi ko bahumat'bijepi netaa ashish shellar ne twit main kaha, “philhal biemasi main ham alpamat main hai
 We do not have enough figures
 lekin ham vipaksh ke saath haath nahin milaayenge
 In 2022 we will have a lot of data and we will have a mayor
 ”jahaan tak congress kaa sawaal he to wo abhi pattey kholane ko taiyaar nahin he
 Congress leaders in Maharashtra say that they are waiting for instructions from the High Command
 congress netaa ravi raja ke mutabik “hamaare parshad somvaar dopaher ko baithak karne ja rahe hai jahaan unhemparty haikaman ke faislese avgat karaayaa jayega
 "in 2017, Shiv Sena and BJP contested separate elections but BJP supported Shiv Sena mayoral candidate Vishwanath Mahadeshwar
 us vakt shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare ne dabaav kii ranneeti se kaam liya tha
 Sources said that BJP can now apply for the post of Leader of the Opposition in the BMBC
 bataa den ki biemasi desh ke sabase amir sthaneey nikaayon main se he
 Now, in the changed political developments, the election of the post of Mayor in BMC will be the first time when Shiv Sena and BJP will come face to face
 18 november tak partiyon ko apane ummidavaaron ke naamon par muhar lagaani he
 Film Name: 'the Ghazi Attack' Director: Sankalp Reddystar Cast: Atul Kulkarni, KK Menon, Rana Daggubatti, Taapsee Pannu, Om Puri, Rahul Singh Duration: 2 hours 05 minutes Certificates: u / a Rating: 3
 5 starkaran johar ne kiya rana daggubaati kii film kaa poster relizabharat or pakistan ke bich kai yuddh hue hai jinke bare main aapako jaankaree he lekin ek aisi ladaai bhi hui thi jiske bare main bahut kam logon ko hi pataa he
 The film 'the Ghazi Attack' is based on the 1971 inner battle
 aaiye jaane aakhir kisi he film kii kahani or kya he isamen khaas
 
 
 Story: This story dates back to 1971 when Bangladesh was known as East Pakistan
 us samay bangladesh ke baagi logon ke upar pakistan kii army kadi kaarywahi karti rahati thi
 On November 17, the Indian Naval Army headquarters reports that an attack on India's INS Vikrant is going to be made by Pakistan through the sea
 nau sena head ve pi nanda (om puri) is baat kii shinaakht karne ke liye oparation 'search land' kaa gathan karte hai jisaki jimmedaari es 21 naamak pandubbi ke captain ranvijay singh (ke ke menon) or leftinent commander arjuna (rana daggubatti) ke haath main hoti he
 Also, Devraj (atul Kulkarni) is also present in this team
 phir pani ke bheetar kis tarah se es 21, pakistan ke pienes gaji par atake karke unase maar giraata he, ise film ke dauraan darshaya gaya he
 In 'the Ghazi Attack', some will be seen in this style; Taapsee can see this film- This film depicts the unheard story which is rarely known and Director Writer Sankalp Reddy showed the whole story in a very unique way
 is
 jisamen kabhi aap imotional hote hai to kabhi kursi pakad ke baith jate hai to kabhi raashtra prem kii bhaavana bhi jaagrit hoti he
 - The cinematography of the film is amazing, due to which you can really feel the events happening inside and outside the submarine
 - atul kulkarni, ke ke menon jaise umdaa abhinaytaon kii maujuudagi is film ko or bhi zyada aakarshak banaati he
 At the same time, the work of Rana Daggubatti and Rahul Singh is also commendable
 om puri sahab ne bhi hameshaa kii tarah sahaj abhinay kiya tha haalanki wo is film ko dekh paane se pehle hi ham sabko chhod kar ja chuke hai
 Taapsee Pannu also has a small but good role
 - film kaa viefex or becoground score bhi kaabil e taareef he
 Dialogues are also accurate
 mjedaar he taapasi kii is film kaa trailor
 
 
 Weak Links: This film is not full of item songs, spice jokes and comedy and is not a commercial film at all
 yah acting ke saath-saath tathyon ko jaahir karti he jo shaayad sabhi ke mizaaj ko sahi naa lage
 Along with Dharma Productions in the box office film, many producers have invested money and the earning of the three days of the film's opening can be special
 vaise anil thadani ne is film ko puure bharat main distribute kiya he jo kii desh ke bade distributors main se ek hai
 Now the advantages or disadvantages will be known only after the weekend
 isse pehle kii tamaam hatyaon par chup rahane vaale or unase sahanubhuti rakhane vaale zombi jagat ke log bengal main bijepi kaaryakarta kii hatya ko lekar poochne aa jaaen, bengal kii hinsa par kisi aupchaarikta ke liye nahin balki vaaki kuch kiye jane ke liye likhaa or bolaa janaa chahie
 This incident is shameful
 bheed kii raajnneeti har jagah ab jagah le chuki he
 Such killings are nothing more than a chance for its expansors
 magar bheed mukt ahimsak loktantr main yaqiin rakhane waalon ke liye yah khataranaak sanket he
 Such incidents are securing the path of politics for some special people
 jinke paas paisa he or jinke paas takat he
 This incident in Bengal shows that doing politics on the ground is becoming as difficult as it is to do politics free from the pressure of money lenders
 bijepi ke is dalit kaaryakarta ko isliye maar kar taang diya gaya kyonki yah party kii tarafadaari kar rahaa tha
 In any sense, he was doing a legal work in democracy
 kisi dal kaa samarthan karnaa gair kanoonee yaa aniatik kaary to nahin he
 In Bengal, activists of every party are being killed in the grip of political violence
 bilkul kerala kii tarah
 In both these states, both the ruling and the opposition have weapons of violence in their hands
 fark sirf itnaa he ki jiske paas satta he uske paas krurta ke kai tareeke hai or wo zyaada krur he
 The opposition is also playing the same game
 maare ja rahe hai aam log jo frontline par kisi party ke liye kaam karte hai
 There was so much criticism about the violence that took place before and after the Panchayat elections in Bengal, but to no effect
 chunaav ke baad bhi hinsa jari he
 The political parties of the state have never been honest about violence
 kisi ne dharmik juluus ko bahaanaa banaaya to kisi ne akele main ghaat lagaaya to kisi ne ghar hi phoonk dene kaa plan banaaya
 Mamta Banerjee is playing with fire
 lambey samay se vahi satta main hai isliye hinsa kii is samskruti ko na roak paane kii javabdehi unheen kii he
 It is also shameful why their own worker is killed, are their workers also not safe
 yaa itane belgaum ho chuke hai ki bijepi ke kaaryakarta surakshit nahin hai
 Sadly, even after this murder, there will be no consensus on ending the violence, it will be used to justify the violence elsewhere
 kaaryakartaaon ko samajhnaa chahie ki bade netaaon ke khel main uskaa istamaal ho rahaa he
 Arrangements are being made to enjoy the power of some people at the cost of his life or by implicating him in lawsuits
 kaash ek baar ye kaaryakarta hi vidroh kar dete
 Subhojit Bagchi reports in the Hindu of 26 May that the BJP has performed well in Jhargram and Purulia districts in Bengal
 jhargram ke ek block main bijepi ne adivasee samanvay manch ke liye seat chhod di
 It has the support of the CPI Maoist
 bijepi ke pradesh adhyaksh dilip ghosh ne bhi reporter se mana he ki adivasee samanvay manch se samjhauta tha
 We have no formal agreement but both of us were fighting TMC
 ham unhen jaanate hai or bhavishya main kaam bhi kar sakate hai
 Ghosh has denied any agreement with the Maoist
 lekin maovadiyon ne adivasee samanvay manch ko vot dene ke liye un jagahon par apil jari kii thi jahaan bijepi ne ummidavaar nahin utaare the
 Posters were also put up
 agar aisa he to bengal main abhi koon karaaba or hona tay he
 Its bloody politics has remained in place since the era of the Left government
 bas ise nibhaane vaale kirdaar badalte rahete hai
 The bjp's Dalit worker has been killed in Purulia, which has been killed and hung from a tree
 laash par chetavanee chipka di gai he ki bijepi kaa samarthan karne par yahi hashr hoga
 Three days ago, a trans-woman was killed by a mob in Hyderabad as rumors spread through whatsapp that she steals a child
 police ne do chaatro ko is maamle main giraftaar kiya he
 They are accused of making fake videos viral on whatsapp
 isi tarah kii ghatana pichley saal jharkhand main ho chuki he
 a mob has created a rumor from whatsapp, and he discovered and killed some people and injured some
 bharat vaaqai zombistan banate ja rahaa he
 There is a public ready everywhere, which i call Robo Public
 us public ko ek afvaah kii zarurat hoti he, uksaave kii zarurat hoti he vah bhabhak uthati he
 It breaks on someone
 is bheed ko kabhi vichaardhaara or jhuthe propeganda se bhabhakaaya jaataa he to kabhi satta ke varchasv ke jhuthe ahankaar ke zarie
 But both these types of crowd are becoming one
 tippaniyan So resist violence, not just the incident, but also understand the process happening around that event
 chaahe wo kisi dal kii sarkaar vaale rajya main hoti ho, chaahe usame kisi vichaardhaara se prerit log shaamil hon yaa phir achaanak aae gusse se taish main aakar hinsa karne vaale log hon
 Resist even when you write, do not resist even if you write
 yah maamla haath se ja chukaa he, ise rokane ke liye kadi mehnat kerani padegi
 Netwa will not do everything, you have to

 bengal kii yah ghatana bataati he ki zamin par raajnneeti karnaa utana hi mushkil hota ja rahaa he jitna paise waalon ke dabaav se mukt hokar raajnneeti karnaa
 This dalit worker of BJP was killed because he was favoring the party
 kisi bhi lihaaz se vah loktantr main ek vaidhanik kaam kar rahaa tha
 It is not illegal or unethical to support any party
 raajnneetik hinsa ke chapete main bengal main har dal ke kaaryakarta maare ja rahe hai
 Just like Kerala
 in donon rajya main satta paksh or vipaksh donon ke haath main hinsa kaa hathiyaar he
 The only difference is that the one who has power has many ways of cruelty and is more cruel
 vipaksh bhi vahi khel khel rahaa he
 People are being killed who work for a party on the frontline
 bengal ke panchayat chunaavon ke pehle or baad main hui hinsa ko lekar kitni aalochana hui, magar uskaa kuch asar nahin hua
 Violence continues even after the election
 rajya ke raajnneetik dal kabhi hinsa ko lekar eemaandaar nahin rahe
 If someone pretends to be a religious procession, someone makes ambush alone, then someone plans to blow up the house
 mamata banerjee aag se khel rahi hai
 He has been in power for a long time, so he is responsible for not stopping this culture of violence
 yah bhi sharmnaak he ki unka hi kaaryakarta kyon maaraa jaataa he, kya unke kaaryakarta bhi surakshit nahin hai
 Or it has become so heartless that BJP workers are not safe
 afsos he ki is hatya ke baad bhi hinsa ko khatm karne par sahmati nahin banegi, iskaa istamaal hoga, duusari jagahon kii hinsa ko jaays tehraane ke liye
 Activists should understand that they are being used in the game of big leaders
 uski jaan kii keemat par yaa phir use mukademon main fansaa kar kuch logon ke satta sukh bhogane kaa intazaam ho rahaa he
 i wish these workers would revolt once
 26 may ke hindu main subhojit bagchi kii khabar he ki bengal main jhargram or purulia zile main bijepi kaa pradarshan acha rahaa he
 In a block of Jhargram, BJP gave up the seat for the Adivasi Samman Manch
 ise sipiai maovadi kaa samarthan hasil he
 BJP state president Dilip Ghosh has also admitted to the reporter that there was agreement with the tribal coordination platform
 hamaara koi aupchaarik samjhauta nahin he magar ham donon tiemasi se lard rahe the
 We know them and can also work in the future
 ghosh ne maovadi se samjhaute kii baat se inkaar kiya he
 But the Maoists had issued an appeal in places where the BJP did not field candidates to vote for the tribal coordination platform
 poster bhi lagaae the
 If this is the case then there is sure to be more blood in Bengal
 vam sarkaar ke jamaane se isaki kooni raajnneeti apni jagah par bani hui he
 The characters who play it just keep changing
 bijepi ke dalit kaaryakarta kii purulia main hi hatya hui he jise maar kar ped se taang diya gaya he
 a warning has been pasted on the corpse that the same will happen if it supports the BJP
 teen din pehle hyderabad main bheed ne ek trans-mahila ko maar diya, kyonki whatsap se afawaah fail gai ki wo baccha churaati he
 Police has arrested two students in this case
 in par aarope he ki inhone phek video banaakar whatsap par viral kiya he
 a similar incident has happened in Jharkhand last year
 whatsap se faile afawaah ke kaaran ek bheed ban gai he or usne khoj kar kuch logon kii hatya kar di or kuch ko ghayal kar diya
 India is really becoming a zombie
 har jagah ek public taiyaar he, jise main robo public kahata hum
 That public needs a rumor, a provocation is needed, it fizzles out
 kisi par tut padati he
 This crowd is sometimes driven by ideology and false propaganda, sometimes by false arrogance of power supremacy
 magar in donon tarah kii bheed ek hoti ja rahi he
 The comments isliye hinsa kaa virodh kiijie, sirf ghatana kaa nahin, us ghatana ke aas paas hone vaali prakriya ko bhi samajhie
 Whether it is in a state with a party government, whether it involves people inspired by any ideology or if there are people who commit violence in a fit of sudden anger
 aap likhen tab bhi virodh karen, na likh paaen tab bhi virodh karen
 This matter has gone out of hand, one has to work hard to stop it
 netwa sab nahin karegaa, aapako karnaa padegaa

 bengal ke panchayat chunaavon ke pehle or baad main hui hinsa ko lekar kitni aalochana hui, magar uskaa kuch asar nahin hua
 Violence continues even after the election
 rajya ke raajnneetik dal kabhi hinsa ko lekar eemaandaar nahin rahe
 If someone pretends to be a religious procession, someone makes ambush alone, then someone plans to blow up the house
 mamata banerjee aag se khel rahi hai
 He has been in power for a long time, so he is responsible for not stopping this culture of violence
 yah bhi sharmnaak he ki unka hi kaaryakarta kyon maaraa jaataa he, kya unke kaaryakarta bhi surakshit nahin hai
 Or it has become so heartless that BJP workers are not safe
 afsos he ki is hatya ke baad bhi hinsa ko khatm karne par sahmati nahin banegi, iskaa istamaal hoga, duusari jagahon kii hinsa ko jaays tehraane ke liye
 Activists should understand that they are being used in the game of big leaders

 Through this mantra, the modi-shah duo managed to hoist the saffron flag in many states of the country
 ab is jodi kaa lakshya 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ko 350 plus seat jeetna he
 pmmodi has taken care of this equation while expanding in his cabinet
 yahi vajah he ki modi ke nae mantrimandal main rajyon ke vidhansabha chunaav ke zyada loksabhaa chunaav ko dhyaan main rakhte hue chehre chune gaye hai
 While the changes made in the Modi government earlier, it reflected the assembly elections in the states, but this time it was not done
 bijepi ko 350+ seat kaa lakshya puraa karnaa he to use costal ilaake kii 123 loksabhaa siton ko bhi dhyaan main rakhana hoga
 BJP could never win these seats
 inamen tamilnadu-pudducheri kii 40, kerala kii 20, pashchim bengal kii 42 or odisha kii 21 siten shaamil hai
 Keeping these seats in mind, Modi has been given a place of selections in the cabinet
 odisha se dharmendra pradhan ko cabinetmantri banaaya gaya he, to kerala ko dhyaan main rakhte hue alfons kannathanam ko paryaton mantralay (swatantra prabhaar) kaa jimmaa diya gaya he
 Apart from this, Nirmala Sitharaman has been given the responsibility of Ministry of Defense in view of Tamil nadu-puducherry and Andhra Pradesh
 nirmala desh kii pehali purnakalik mahila raksha mantri hai
 The 120 seats of up-bihar comprise a total of 120 seats, including 80 Lok Sabha seats of UP and 40 seats in Bihar
 modi mantrimandal main sabase zyada mantri inhen donon rajya se hai
 There are 12 ministers from UP and 9 from Bihar
 jabaki jediu ko abhi mantrimandal main jagah nahin mili he
 In the Modi cabinet reshuffle on Sunday, two ministers of up-bihar have been given place
 upi se satyapal singh or shivapratap shukla ko rajyamantri banaaya gaya he, to vahiin bihar se aarake singh ko rajyamantri (swatantra prabhaar) or ashvini choube ko rajyamantri banaaya gaya he
 Rajasthan has 25 Lok Sabha seats, in the last election the BJP made a clean sweep here
 yahaan se modi cabinet main gajendra singh shekhavat ko jagah mili he
 Shekhawat won the pm's heart through his plan to build a new India by connecting youth through social media
 modi new india kii baat kar rahe hai
 In such a situation, Shekhawat can be useful for them
 modi ke tisare cabinet ke pherbadal main un rajyon ko jagah nahin mili jahaan is saal vidhansabha chunaav hone hai
 Assembly elections are due in Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh in a few months
 baavjood iske vahaan se kisi bhi nae mantri ko shaamil nahin kiya gaya he
 In such a situation, it is clear that Modi's target is more of the Lok Sabha of the assembly

 Due to this, many times the party has faced difficulties

 When asked by Gadkari that the speed of his roads is fast, but why the speed of the government car is low, he said that the comparison of 10 years of Congress tenure work and the work of Modi government of last four years before 2014 If we do, it will be known that the Modi government's car is running at a fast pace
 unhone kaha ki beete chaar saal main modi sarkaar ne vikaas samet har morche par behatar kaam kiya
 In 'aaj Tak' flagship show 'sidhi Baat', Gadkari counted the figures and claimed that good work has been done not only in the NDA government but also in the field of employment

 The government of West Bengal wants to change the name of the state
 lekin ye kaam jaldbaazi main nahin hoga pehle sabhi vidhayakon or political partiyon se baatcheet hogi
 The reason for changing the name is very strange
 pashchim bengal ke udyog mantri partho chatarji ne cabinet kii baithak ke baad kaha ki pashchim bengal yani west bengal kaa naam w se shuru hota he
 So whenever there is a government program at the national level, according to ABCD, the name of West Bengal comes later and the representatives of the state get the opportunity to speak later
 badi shikaayat ye he ki jab tak bengal ke numaayinde bolne ke liye khadey hote hai bahut der ho chuki hoti he zyaadaatar log thak chuke hote hai yaa bor ho chuke hote hai or chale jate hai
 Hence the voice of West Bengal remains unheard
 mamata banerjee ko is samasya se nibatane kaa ek hi rasta nazar aa rahaa he ki rajya kaa naam hi badal diya jaae
 West Bengal Chief Secretary Samar Ghosh has been tasked by Mamta Banerjee for further action in this regard
 zaahir he ki nayaa naam aisa hona chahie jo alpha bet main pehle aae
 But if it comes first then it can also cause problems because people in government and non-government programs in India do not arrive on time and arrive late
 aise main jo pehle bolne ke liye uthegaa
 He may not get the listener
 isliye mamata banerjee kam se kam alfabet a se to naam naa hi rakhen
 That is, do not keep the name of Amar Bengal, just keep Bengal
 haryana ke varisht IAS virendra kundu kii beti varnika kundu ke saath chhedchhad kaa maamla surkhiyon main he

 But sections 341, 365 and 511 were added to the case after a few hours
 magar teesri baar 365 or 511 ko hataakar keval dhara 341 ko hi joda gaya
 Section 354D of IPC - Stalking with wrong intent
 sajaa - teen saal kii sajaa or jurmaana
 Section 185 of Motor Vehicle Act - Driving in intoxicated condition
 sajaa - 6 maah kii sajaa or jurmaana
 Section 341 of IPC - Prevention with wrong intent
 sajaa - ek maah kii sajaa or 500 rupee jurmaana
 Clauses that have been removed: Section 365 of IPC - kidnapping for the purpose of secretly and unfairly banning a person
 sajaa - adhiktam 7 saal kii sajaa
 Section 511 of IPC - Trying to commit a serious crime
 sajaa - adhiktam aaajeevan karawas
 Were these clauses removed in view of the influence of the ruling party? Both these clauses (365 and 511) are non-bailable
 iske baavjood donon aropiyon ko usee din police stesan se jamaanat de di gai
 It is alleged that the policemen first filed a case against the accused in the serious sections, but as soon as Vikas Barala was revealed to be the son of the ruling party's influential leader, he deliberately removed the list of serious charges from development and filed a case in the minor sections
 Gave bail only from the tax station
 chandigarh ke nami vakil ranjan lakhanpal ne bataaya ki police ne aropiyon ko police stesan se jamaanat dekar nyaayalay ko bypass karne kii koshish kii he, kyonki maamalasattadhari partise judaa he
 After being accused of bias on social media, Vikas Barala and Ashishalgatar can now be arrested, now the police have sent the girl's complaint and the statements given under Section 164 of crpc to the court for legal opinion
 kanoonee raay aane ke baad police tay karegi ki kya aaropee vikaas baraala or ashish ke khilaaf kidnaping ke prayaas kii dhara 365 / 511 ke tahat cese darj kiya jaae yaa nahin
 Vikas Barala and Ashish can be arrested again if the DDA allows them to file a case in their report
