 Modi also lashed out at corruption
 unhone adarsh sosayadi ghotaalaa ke masale par congress sarkaar kii jamkar aalochana kii

 'when Shahzade comes here, it seems that he forgets that elections are going to be held all over the country, not only in Gujarat
 unhen gujarat ko gaali dene ke bajaay yah bataanaa chahie ki unki sarkaar ne kya kiya
 He says that the balloon of Gujarat's development model will explode, but in the 2007 and 2012 assembly elections in Gujarat, he would have come to know that people are with the truth
 'sharad pavaar par nishaanaa sadhate hue modi ne kaha, 'kendriya krishi mantri isi rajya se hai lekin kisaanon kii raksha karne main naakaam rahe hai

 1insaan ke taur par ham ek duusare ke saath jo krurta baratate hai,unamem sabase zyaada krur yah kahana he:''tum jise pasand karte ho, usase prem nahin karoge yaa yon sambandh nahin rakh sakoge, yah isliye nahin ki tum donon balinng nahin ho yaa ek taraf kii razaamandi nahin he, balki isliye ki tum donon alag dharm ke ho, alag jati ke ho, ek hi gaanv ke ho, ek hi gender ke ho
 You can say that you love each other, that you get peace, courage and happiness from each other, but i hate your love
 yah parampara ke viruddh he, kaanoon ke kilaaf he, prakruti ke niyam ke anuroop nahin he, isse hamaare parivaar kii izzat mitti main mil jaaegi, hamaari nasl shraab ho jaaegi, isse kaliyug aa jayega, yah hamaare samaaj main sadaandh paidaa kar degaa, yah ishwar kii nazar main ghrunit he
 it is forbidden
 tum kah sakate ho ki tum ek-duusare se pyaar karte ho lekin mujhe isaki parvaah nahin
 i cannot ignore this and cannot let both of you live in peace
 mujhe kuch karnaa hi padegaa, or main zarur karuunga
 No, you have spoiled me, i will definitely spoil you
 main tumhen nikaal duungaa, main tumhen kamina samajhuunga, tumhen jati baahar kar duungaa yaa apradhi ghoshit karvaa duungaa
 i will lock you up, break your legs, throw acid on your face, hang you with a crane, make you join me
 agar balavaayiyon kaa jhund meraa saath detaa he to behatar, agar kaanoon kii sahaayta milti he to behatar, agar rashtravaadi naare kaa sahaara miltaa ho to behatar, agar dharm ke chole se madad milti ho to behatar, lekin kisi na kisi tarah main tum donon ko alag karke hi rakhuunga
 It is right and appropriate for me to do this
 main yah karuunga kyonki meri jati yaa birdari yahi kahati he, meri panchayat yahi kahati he, falaan shaastra yahi kahata he, is kaanoon kii yah dhara yahi kahati he, sabhyataa khud yahi kahati he, swayan ishwar yahi kahata he
 No argument will work
 insaaniyat mujhe rijhaa nahin paaegi
 i do not know Indian history
 aadhunik vigyaan ko main nahin maanata
 It is simple, i recite this: My love is virtue, your love is sin
 ”2is tarah sochane waalon ke bare main kya kaha ja saktaa he—aise log jo apni zidagi main kush rahane kii bajaae dusron kii zindagi, unki azaadi, unki kushi mitaane ko aatur hai?koi apni beti ko maut ke ghat utaar detaa he kyonki vah apane gaanv ke kisi ladke se pyaar karti he
 Someone blackmails the two loving men or tries to send them to jail
 koi kisi aurat ko uski garlfriend se jabaran alag kar detaa he or use sahi sex kaa sashak sikhaane ke liye uskaa rape kar detaa he
 Somebody kills their son for loving another girl
 koi apni bahan ke chehre ko tezaab se jala detaa he sirf is vajah se ki vah duusare dharm ke ladke se pyaar karti he
 The mindset is the same
 sabhi maanate hai ki ve sahi kar rahe hai, or isi se unhen gunaah kaa license miltaa he
 There is neither humanity in their heart nor the love that we are told is the foundation of religion
 unamem yah nafrat andar se nahin, balki baahar se aati he: badbhole baba se, matlabi mullah se, paapi padri se, khap panchayat yaa vot kii shatir bheed ko uksaane vaale rajnatik dal se, or najayas kaanoonon ko jaays tehraane or un par amal karwaane vaale se
 3 We are the inhabitants of a small planet in one of the stars of the universe
 yahan jivan kisi ke liye aasaan nahin he
 Fear and error, failure and despair, pain and disease, death and separation cannot relieve even those who have got rid of poverty
 prem hi is jivan ko sahane laay$k banaata he: prem karnaa, prem paanaa—or maut yaa judaai ke baad bhi yah mahasoos karnaa ki tumne prem kiya yaa paaya
 Not being able to love your loved one is death
 jabaran judaai ruh kaa qatl he
 If a person is thinking about this, then he will never be so cruel even in his thoughts

 Special Public Prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam said that the 26 / 11 case is not only against the Pakistani gunman Kasab, but also against the terrorist organization lashkar-e-tayyaba, the mastermind of the attacks
 hamalon kii barsi ke ek din purv die saakshaatkaar main nikam ne kaha ‘‘kasaab to aatanki sanghathan kaa sirf ek mohara he
 He and his companions are a small part of Lashkar, who wanted to do serious damage to the country by targeting India's commercial capital
 ’’ nikam ne kaha ki abhiyojan ne hamalon se pakistan ke taar jude hone ke bare main thos saboot rakhe hai
 This evidence is in the form of a telephone conversation between the terrorists and their Pakistani masters
 saarvajanik abhiyojak ne kaha ki agar pakistan apni dharti se paidaa ho rahe aatank ko khatm karnaa chahta he to uski jaanch agenciyaan in sabooton kaa upyog kar sakati hai
 He said that Pakistan could match the voices of fugitive accused, who are believed to be hiding somewhere in the country, with the voice of these masters
 yah milan lashkar ke un sandigdhon se bhi ho saktaa he, jin par vahaan mukadmaa chal rahaa he
 Nikam said Kasab has revealed to a magistrate that he and one of his accomplices were trained by a Major General in a Lashkar camp in Pakistan
 nikam chaahate hai ki us major kii pahchaan jaahir kii jaae
 Nikam said that Kasab has no regrets at all
 unhone kaha ‘‘kasaab ne magistrate se kaha ki vah apane jaise ‘fidayinon’ ko prerit karne ke liye swechha se bayaan de rahaa he
 We have kept this shameless behavior in his record
 ’’hamalon kaa shadyantr pakistan main rachaa jane ke kaaran abhiyojan dwaara ise sabit karnaa ek chunauti bharaa kaam tha
 To this, Nikam said, "luckily, i am now in a position to prove, through documentary evidence, how this satanic conspiracy to sabotage India was hatched and executed by Lashkar
 ’’nikam ne kaha ‘‘jis kshan maine is maamle main aaropapatr daakhil kiya, usee kshan mujhe isaki vrihadta kaa andaja laga
 i left many more important matters and gave it full priority
 main har din saadhe chaar baje uth kar maamle ke liye apane nots banaata tha

 With this, Air India became the first airline in the world to pass over the Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean and the Polar Region
 (input bhashaa se bhi) Tensions between the US and North Korea seem to be heading towards extremes
 sanyukt raashtra aam sabha main america raashtrapati ne taanashaah kim ko tabaahi kii dhamkee di to jawaab dene ke liye wo taanashaah kim jong un khud saamne aayaa jo kabhi media ke saamne aata hi nahin
 The North Korean media has released a photo of Keem
 saath hi kaha gaya he ki netaa kim jong-un ne america raashtrapati donald trump ko ‘‘maansik veikshipt’’ bataakar unka majaak udaate huye chetavanee di ki vah yah sunishchit karenge ki america raashtrapati ko sanyukt raashtra main unke desh ke vinaash sambandhi bayaan dene ke liye ‘‘baari keemat’’ chukaani hogi
 Trump, in his first address to the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday, shocked the world by warning North Korea that Washington would "completely destroy" America and its allies if they were attacked
 pyongyang dwaara pichley kuch samay se chalaaye ja rahe parmaanu or missile kaaryakramon kii vajah se badhate tanaav ke bich yuddh ke liye uksaane vaala yah bayaan saamne aayaa he
 North Korea conducted its sixth and largest nuclear test bypassing all international sanctions and launched missiles passing over Japan
 uttar korea kii sarkari samachar agency kesiene ne kim ko uddhrut karte huye kaha, ‘‘main yah sunishchit karuunga ki america main sarvocch kaman kaa visheshadhikaar sambhaal rahe shaks ko deepiarake ko puri tarah barbaad karne kaa bayaan dene ke liye baari keemat chukaani pade
 "kim also questioned the mental health of the American leader over Trump calling him a" rocket man "and said," The statement of a sovereign nation "completely devastated" on the United Nations platform by a mentally deranged American Refers to the president's immoral desire
 ’’ uttar korea kaa kahana he ki aakraamak america se bachane ke liye use parmaanu pratirohak kshamta kii jarurat he or is taanaashaahee nizaam ne sanyeekaran ko apni rashtriya vichaardhaara kaa kendriya hissaa bana liya he
 The statement emphasizes that Kim is not going to get out of her way at the moment

 '' haji mastaan or sukur narayan bakhiya kii jodi gold kii taskari ke liye kukhyat thi or unhen taskari ke nayab tareeke ijad karne ke liye janaa jaataa tha
 Looks like those days have returned
 gold emport par custom duty badaae se taskari ke jariye gold phir se bharat aa rahaa he or is pili dhaatu kii taskari ke liye log apni jaan tak ko jokhim main daal rahe hai
 The only thing is that the craze for gold among smugglers is again showing its color
 zyada paisa banane kii sambhaavna se agar taskaron kii laar tapak rahi he, to aisa hota dikh bhi rahaa he
 The truth is that they do not want to waste any time
 pichley 15 dinon main hi indira gandhi international airport ke custom adhikariyon ne baari maatra main gold jabt kiya he or 10 logon ko giraftaar kiya he
 The last arrest took place on June 19, when officers caught four passengers
 daanv par bahut kuch laga hone kii vajah se gold kii taskari main shaamil log is keemtee dhaatu ko chhipaakar laane ke liye nai-nai yuktiyon kaa istemaal kar rahe hai
 At Delhi's Indira Gandhi International Airport, the authorities were shocked by the unique way of smuggling a man who was about to escape
 usne gold ke stapler pin banavaakar unase food procesar or ek dibbe ko panch kar rakhaa tha
 a man was caught in Kolkata's Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Airport carrying a gold bar hidden in his stomach
 mumbai main custom adhikariyon ne pehali najar main samaj liya tha ki abdul rahamaan kuch chipa rahaa he
 The 35-year-old had just arrived at Chhatrapati Shivaji Airport in Mumbai on a Emirates flight from Dubai with a handbag
 use green channel ko paar karte samay roka gaya
 When placed around her waist, the metal detector would beep, while nothing was found in her belongings or clothes
 poochtacha ke baad usne custom adhikariyon ko bataaya ki usne pet ke andar gold ke paanch biscuit chipa rakhe the jinka vajan kareeb 500 gram tha
 The truth is that Rahman had taken these precautions and wrapped these biscuits in carbon paper before putting the gold in his stomach
 custom adhikariyon ke mutabik, aam taur par taskari ke liye taskar carbon paper kaa istemaal karte hai kyonki unako lagata he ki agar is paper main laptekar koi cheez laai gai to use airport ke scinar nahin pakad paaenge
 As of June 27, six cases of gold smuggling were reported at Mumbai airport
 sutara bataate hai, ''aam taur par bharat main taskar badi maatra main gold kii taskari nahin karnaa chaahate
 They insist on bringing a little gold in pieces instead
 jab emport duty 6 fisadi thi, to yah samasya zyada nahin thi
 But with it increasing to 8 per cent, profits on gold smuggling have increased
 ” khadi deshon se aane vaale yatriyon par khaas najar rakhi ja rahi he
 Gold in Dubai is Rs 1 lakh per kg as compared to Mumbai
 tak sasta he
 Those arrested include 22-year-old Palestinian citizen Muhammad Al Shair Rana, a student of civil engineering in Cairo
 usne taskari ke maal ko chhipaane ke ek nae tareeke kaa khulaasa kiya
 When he was stopped, he was trying to go out of the Green Channel
 uske handbag kii talaashi lee gai to usamen kuch bhi aapattijanak nahin mila
 But after a thorough examination, it was found that he was carrying 10 gold bars and two small gold biscuits each weighing 1 kg which he had hidden in his jeans
 gold ko chhipaane ke liye uske genes ke pocket alag tarah se banaae gaye the
 During interrogation, Rana told that he was promised that if he delivered the goods to the right place, he would get a commission of $ 500
 prashasan ke log aage aane vaali chunautiyon ke prati sachet ho rahe hai, yah samajhate hue ki aage taskari kii ghatnaayen badhengi
 Abdul Rahman, who was caught on arrival at Chhatrapati Shivaji Airport from Dubai, was repeatedly telling customs officials that he had come to India 13 times from Dubai so far and each time he had hidden gold inside his body
 isse adhikari yah sochane par majaboor ho gaye hai ki aakhir sone kii kitni or kin-kin tareekon se taskari ho rahi he or ise kaise roke
 (along with Krishna Kumar) The season returned to 'yellow Metal' Cgold imports, increasing the current account deficit and consequently continued rupee depreciation forced the government to increase the customs duty on gold imports to 8 per cent
 haalanki 1992 main sone kii taskari main giravat ai thi jab sarkaar ne aadhikarik raste se iskaa emport khol diya
 450 per 10 grams to NRI
 kii duty chukaakar 5 kilo tak gold laane kii ijaajat di gai
 In order to curb smuggling of gold, the import duty was later reduced to Rs 220 per 10 grams
 kar diya gaya
 But that phase is coming to an end because Indians' gold craving is not taking the name of ending
 is saal april 2012 ke 3
 Gold imports in April rose 138 percent to 7 percent against $ 1 billion
 5 arab dollar tak pahunch gaya
 Apart from increasing the import duty on the government's gold, the Reserve Bank has also imposed various limits on the gold import of banks
 aathven dashak ke madhya main apni yuva avasthaa main mumbai airport par tainaat rahe or ab varisht custom adhikari ban chuke ek shaks ne bataaya ki pehle gold dubai, singapore, bangkok or honkong se taskari ke madhyam se bharat main aata tha
 At the same time, Finance Minister P

 chidambaram ne ek tarah se deshavaasiyon se vinati kii he ki ve gold khareednaa band karen or haal main shuru kiye gaye inflation indexd bond jaise nae vittiya sadhano main invest karen
 However, leading business chamber Assocham believes that these bonds are not very effective as they have a longer maturity period
 ab yah sarkaar par he ki vah gold taskari ke is nae daur se nibatane ke liye kis tarah kii ranneeti apanaati he
 Haider Mirza, a black businessman, had made a tremendous leap from working as a porter at Bombay Dock to the most notorious smuggler of his time
 dock ke bare main apni jaankaree kaa istemaal karte hue vah electronic saamaan kii taskari karne laga or jahaajon ke captain or custom adhikariyon ko ghoose dekar sone kii taskari tak pahunch gaya
 Mastan was arrested during the Emergency and he spent 18 months in prison
 phir usne daawa kiya ki vah sudhar gaya he
 After this, he named it Haji Mastan
 daaud ibrahim pehle chota-motaa chor tha
 It later became one of the largest smugglers in the country
 haji mastaan ne use apana uttaradhikari banaaya
 It is said that Dawood had his first contact with the ISI in an effort to secure gold and his other goods
 pakistan main hone ke baavjood daaud kaa dabadabaa khatm nahin hua he
 His people are engaged in smuggling business in Mumbai
 1992 ke dhamaakon ke liye ardex usee raste se laayaa gaya tha jis raste se gold or taskari ke anya saamaan laae jate the
 Sukur Narayan Bakhia was also the smuggler of Haji Mastan, Varadarajan Mudaliar, Lallu Jogi and Karim Lala

 upi main 403 vidhansabha siten hai
 Prashant Kishore has planned to have a team of 20 youths for each assembly constituency, who will be chosen from among the Congress workers
 wo pradesh str par congress ko phir se bulandiyon par le jane ke liye ji-tod mehnat kar rahe hai lekin ye unke liye kisi chunautiyaan kam nahin hongi
 Committees will be formed at a small level
 Their team will soon start taking interviews to select promising youngsters
 kishor ne sthaneey congress netaaon se 14 sadasyon vaali booth level kii cametiyaan banane ke liye kaha he taaki party ke liye zyada se zyada vot jutaaye ja saken
 Activists to be elected from Congress units, will spread the message to the people, if you believe the message of 20 youth party from every assembly constituency will help in spreading the message to the people and will prove to be a strategist to keep pace with the central leadership
 booth level ke panel ko party kaaryakartaaon ke bich se hi taiyaar kiya jayega
 It has been decided to elect these youth from units like Youth Congress, NSUI and Mahila Congress
 chune gaye kaaryakarta sthaneey logon se sidhe sampark saadhenge or unhen party ke haq main vot dene ke liye raji karenge
 Rahul Gandhi will lead himself
 Through this system, a team of 5000 active workers will be prepared in every constituency
 party ke ek sutara ne kaha ki agar is team kaa istemaas sahi tareeke se kiya jaae, to congress kaa vot share mahatvapurn tareeke se se badhegaa
 These workers will be led by the central leadership and Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi himself, so the morale of the workers will also increase
 jaahir taur par isse pradesh str par kamjor pad chuke sanghathan ko nai takat or bal milegi
 Congress will emerge as a strong organization from weak to weak The infighting between the weak party and local party workers has been the cause of the destruction of the Congress in Uttar Pradesh for decades and due to this the party's influence on 403 assembly seats has reduced considerably

 Whether the CM candidate is Rahul or Priyanka Prashant Kishore, the idea is to put forward Rahul Gandhi's name as the Chief Ministerial candidate from the Congress in Uttar Pradesh, but the central leadership is not in its favor
 kishor ne rahul kii bahan priyanka gandhi ke naam par vichaar karne kaa bhi idia diya he lekin sutron kaa kahana he ki iske liye bhi netaaon main ekamat nahin he
 One reason for this is also that Priyanka has confined herself to campaigning in Amethi and Rai Bareilly
 congress sutron kaa kahana he ki chunaav prachaar kaa jimmaa prashanth kishor ko saunpe jane ko lekar bhi party main milijuli pratikriya he

 However, there has often been a triangular fight on this seat and this time too, three strong candidates are thumping
 bijepi ke pankaj choudhary yahaan se paanch baar saansad rah chuke hai or chhathi baar bhi saansad banane ke liye res main hai
 Pankaj Chaudhary is confident of winning again on the basis of PM Modi, UP CM Yogi Adityanath and the development work done by him, on the other hand, the vote bank of Mahagathbandhan candidate Akhilesh Singh SP-BSP and his victory on the strength of his popularity Are believing teesri pramukh candidet hai congress kii supriya shrinet, jinako apane pita kii viraasat or congress ke votbank par bharosa he
 The contest has also become interesting because the family of Amarmani Tripathi, who plays an effective role in the politics of the district, is seen with the Congress candidate

 On the other hand, SP leader Kunwar Akhilesh Singh Singh, the candidate of the Mahagathbandhan, says that Pankaj Chaudhary, a five-time MP, has done nothing in the name of development in this area

 In fact, Congress has fielded a strong candidate this time and the number of votes they will get will be like a cut in the account of the Grand Alliance candidate

 Apart from this, Pankaj Chaudhary also has his own multi-million Chaudhary vote bank

 Tharoor, a former UN official, endorsed social networking sites like Twitter, Facebook and said that like television, radio and newspapers, it is also a part of new media
 bijepi ke varisht netaa arun jetali ne ek twit kar kaha ki is baar purvottar, pashchim bengal or odisha ke chunaav parinaam behad chaunkaane vaale honge
 The BJP, which again won its own majority in the 2014 elections, is now fighting the political battle of 2019 under the leadership of Narendra Modi
 upi-bihar main bijepi or endie ne pichhali baar adhikansh siten jiti thim
 The party is claiming to repeat the miracle here this time too, but why is the special focus on Odisha and West Bengal? There are two reasons for the bjp's quest for success in new areas
 isamen pehali to majaburi he or duusari ranneeti
 The first reason is that states like up-bihar where most seats were won by BJP-NDA in 2014
 vahaan is baar sapa-basapa gathbandhan, congress-argedy mahagathbandhan jaise elliance ke kaaran badhin chunautiyaan hai
 And another reason is bjp's strong ground in states like odisha-bengal
 darasal bengal or odisha aise rajya hai jahaan kshetreey dal kaaphi majboot hai
 West Bengal is a strong fort of Mamta Banerjee, while Naveen Patnaik's magic has remained in Odisha for a long time
 yahaan tak ki 2014 ke chunaav main modi lahar ke baavjood bijepi in donon rajyon main kuch khaas nahin kar pai thi
 Then the question arises here which BJP the BJP is expecting this time
 darasal iskaa kaaran he 2014 ke baad 5 saal main badale hue jamini halaat
 For this, in both the states, the BJP broke the prominent leaders from the front camp and strengthened its camp
 odisha ko bijepi maan rahi gemeangerodisha main vidhansabha chunaav bhi loksabhaa ke saath ho rahe hai
 Naveen Patnaik has been in power in Odisha for the last 19 years
 2009 tak bijepi bhi unki sahyogi thi
 During this period, BJP strengthened its ground in the state
 odisha main loksabhaa kii 21 siten hai
 In the 1999 elections, in Odisha, BJD got 10 seats, BJP 9 and Congress 2 seats
 2004 main bijedy 9, bijepi 7 or congress 2 seat jeetne main kaamyaab rahi
 In 2009, BJD won 14 seats, Congress 6 and CPI one seat
 lekin 2014 ke chunaav main modi magic ke baavjood bijepi sirf 1 seat jeet saki jabaki bijedy ne 20 siten jeet lee
 Congress account was also not opened
 lekin yaheen se bijepi ne odisha ko apni chunavi ranneeti main pramukhataa se shaamil kar liya
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, BJP got 21 in Odisha
 5 % vot mili
 While it stood second in 9 seats
 inhen siton par bijepi ne focus kar ranneeti ko anjaam dena shuru kiya
 In the last 5 years, Amit Shah has repeatedly visited Odisha
 modi-yogi ne pichley 2 saal main hi odisha main do darjan se zyada reliyaan or road sho kiye
 As soon as the Modi government was formed in 2014, two ministers were made at the Center from Odisha - Dharmendra Pradhan and Joel Oraon
 jameen par sanghathan ko majboot karne kaa jimmaa diya gaya rashtriya sanyukt sanghathan mahaamantri saudaan singh ko
 Who made the workers stand and focused on the organization and focus on increasing membership
 matadaataaon ko sandesh dene ke liye bijepi ne rashtriya kaaryakarini kii baithak odisha main kii
 The results of the panchayat elections in 2017 boosted bjp's enthusiasm and indicated a danger for the BJD
 panchayat chunaav main bijepi ne 296 siten jeetin
 Which was about 8 times the 2012 36 seats
 jabaki 2012 ke chunaav main 128 siten jeetne vaali congress 63 siton par simat kar tisare number par chali gai
 BJP made a strong team to place big bets on Odisha, Odisha
 saudaan singh ko jameen par sanghathan banane kaa jimmaa mila to dharmendra pradhan ko modi sarkaar kii yojanaon kii jaankaree se odisha ke logon ko rubaru karaane kii
 Joel Oraon was asked to focus on tribal areas
 party ne 'bijd half, congress saaf' kaa naaraa diya
 Right there ve
 Singhdev, Basant Panda started to strengthen the party on the ground
 bijedy-congress kheme main lagaai sendodisha main apana khemaa majboot karne ke liye bijepi ne bijedy or congress ke kheme main send lagaai
 In June 2015, BJP included senior Congress leader and former CM Girdhar Gamang in its team
 2014 ke chunaav ke dauraan bijedy main naveen patnayak ke baad balbhadra majhi or bijayant pandas kii ginati hua karti thi
 Today, both are BJP candidates
 ye list yaheen khatm nahin hoti
 mlas like Pratyusha Rajeshwari Singh, BJD MP from Kandhamal, k Narayan Rao and Dama Raut and leaders like Congress's Prakash Behera joined the BJP
 apni party ke bade naamon ko bhi bijepi ne chunaav main utaara he taaki jameen par kaaryakartaaon kaa utsaah bade
 Former IAS Aparajita Sarangi has been fielded from Bhubaneswar Lok Sabha seat while Sambit Patra, her national spokesperson from Puri
 bijepi odisha main piem modi ke chehre par chunaav lard rahi he
 He has expectations from the anti-incumbency factor of Naveen Patnaik's 19-year rule
 bijepi iske alaava chitfund ghotaale, garibi, kisaanon kii samasyaayein or dana maanjhi jaisi ghatnaon ko uthaakar naveen patnayak sarkaar ko gher rahi he
 Mission 23 Vs Mission 42 BJP in Bengal hopes for a political miracle in Odisha as well as in West Bengal
 iskaa kaaran hai- trinmul congress se aae netaa, haal kii chunavi safaltaaen or modi magic se ummiden
 By the way, in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the magic of Mamata Banerjee had gone
 rajya kii 42 main se 34 siton par trinmul ne jeet hasil kii thi
 4 Congress then CPM won 2 seats
 bijepi ke sirf do ummidavaar jeetne main kaamyaab hue the
 This time the BJP wants to establish its influence in the state by working on Mission 23, then Mamata Banerjee is appealing to the public to make the next PM from Bengal by giving the slogan of Mission 42
 bijepi ke liye nai sambhaavnaaon vaala chunaav2014 main bijepi ke liye siten bhale hi 2 thim lekin party ne ise safaltaaon ke dwaar kholane vaala mana
 BJP seats were doubled compared to the 2009 elections
 jabaki teen loksabhaa siton par duusare number par rahi thi
 Vote percentage 17
 02% rahaa tha
 10 as compared to 2009
 88 bad gaya
 Even more important was that due to the weakening of the Left parties and the Congress, it saw increasing possibilities in the state
 loksabhaa chunaav 2019 main bijepi sabhi siton par chunaav lard rahi he
 Many big Trinamool leaders are now in the BJP camp and Mamta has a direct face with Modi's face
 bijepi ne utaare diggaj chehrabijapi adhyaksh amit shah ne april 2017 main 'ebar bangla' yani ab bengal kaa naaraa diya or mishan 23 kaa lakshya rakhaa
 Many leaders, including Mukul Roy, who were the heroes of tmc's victory in 2014, brought in their camp
 tiemasi se aae arjuna singh, saumitr khan, anupam haajra or sipiem chhodkar bijepi main shaamil hone vaale khagen murmu jaise netaaon ko bijepi ne chunaav main tikat diya
 Babul Supriyo, MP from Asansol, is in the fray again
 unako tiemasi kii candidet or beete daur kii abhinetri munmun sen chunauti de rahi hai
 BJP has fielded Subhash Chandra Bose's great-grandson Chandra Kumar Bose from Kolkata South, West Bengal BJP President Dilip Ghosh from Medinipur, actress Lockett Chatterjee from Hooghly, former IPS Bharti Ghosh from Ghatal and Rahul Sinha from Kolkata North seat
 jabaki rajyasabha saansad or abhinetri roopa ganguli or mausami chatarji jamkar bijepi ke liye campan kar rahi hai
 To win the Junglemahal area and polarization, the BJP is expected to win 6 seats in the Junglemahal area, once a stronghold of Naxalism, and hope to get 10 more seats through the Hindutva card
 iske alaava bihar-jharkhand-assam se sate ilaakon or shahari ilaakon par bhi bijepi kii najar he
 Anyway, since 2014, the bjp's graph has grown rapidly in the state
 pehle loksabhaa, phir vidhansabha, nagar nikaay or upachunaav ke baad panchayat chunaavon main bhi bijepi ne apana pradarshan lagaataar sudhara he
 Since 2014, while the position of Congress and Left parties has weakened in the state, bjp's performance has steadily improved
 pashchim bengal panchayat chunaavon main sattarudh tiemasi ne bhale hi clin sweep kar liya tha lekin bijepi ne sabhi ko chaunkaa diya tha
 Out of a total of 31,802 gram panchayat seats, Trinamool occupied 20,848 seats
 jabaki bijepi duusare number kii party banakar ubhari or 5,657 seat jeetne main kaamyaab rahi
 The CPM could win 1415 seats and the Congress only 993 seats
 in donon se zyada to nirdaleey ummidavaaron ne 1741 panchayat siton par jeet hasil kii thi
 In the by-elections, TMC won the Navpada Assembly and Uluberia Lok Sabha seats in addition to BJP number two poll panchayat elections, but surprisingly the BJP got more votes than CPM in both these seats
 2016 main hue vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi ke 3 vidhayak jite or pichhali baar ke mukaable bijepi kaa vot 6 fisadi badha tha
 Whereas before this, BJP did not have a single MLA
 bengal or odisha ke alaava bijepi ko purvottar main bhi achche pradarshan kii ummid he
 By winning seats in these new areas apart from 2014, the BJP is hoping to make up for the loss of less seats in states like up-bihar-rajasthan-gujarat
 haalanki 23 may ko matganana ke baad hi pataa chalegaa ki bijepi kii ranneeti kis had tak safal hoti he
