 Even before the Karnataka assembly election results, Siddaramaiah, the Congress chief ministerial candidate, has run the gamble of the Dalit CM
 iske baad congress ke kai dalit chahare hai, jo siem kii res main he
 But the most strong claim is that of Mallikarjun Kharge
 khadge svachh chhavi ke hone ke saath anbhavi or party alaakaman se lekar sahyogi dalon kii pehali pasand ban jate hai
 But this will only happen when the Congress stays away from the magic figure of majority in Karnataka
 siddharmaiya dalit ke liye kyon chhod rahe siem pad?bataa den ki tamaam agsit pole karnataka main trishanku vidhansabha kii ore ishaara kar rahe hai
 HD Deve Gowda's party plays the role of the JDS as the Kingmaker
 siddharmaiya ke saath jedies kaa chhattis kaa aankada rahaa he
 In such a situation, the JDS will not agree under his name under any circumstances
 jedies ko bijepi ke sang jane se rokane ke lihaaj se siddharmaiya ne khud hi daanv chal diya he
 The Congress can play the Dalit CM card to gain the support of the JDS in the event of a hung assembly
 congress ke is daanv par jedies ko bhi etraj nahin hoga
 Realizing this, Siddaramaiah said, 'I am ready to step down for the Dalit
 agar alaakaman chaahe to kisi dalit ko siem bana saktaa he
 i have no objection to this
 'mallikarjun khadge kii daavedaari majbootsiddharmaiya dalit siem ke bayaan ke baad congress ke pramukh daavedaar ke rup mallikarjun khadge kaa naam he
 Kharge is considered among the stalwarts of the Congress
 iske alaava karnataka main party ke dalit chehre ke saath-saath jamini netaa ke taur par unka naam aata he
 The 2013 assembly elections were contested by taking the name of Mallikarjun Kharge
 yahi vajah thi ki bahumat aane ke baad khadge kaa naam siem ke res main bhi shaamil tha
 But at that time the political situation became such that making Siddaramaiah the CM became the compulsion of the party
 isi ke baad khadge ko rashtriya raajnneeti kii jimmedaari saunpi gai thi
 9 times MLA twice MP tell that Kharge is considered a leader with clean image and has won 9 times and became MLA and second time MP
 karnataka kii raajnneeti main lanbaa anubhav rakhane vaale netaa he
 In such a situation, Kharge is considered as the most powerful contender as the Dalit CM
 karnataka vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan rahul gandhi ke daure main wo saath-saath najar aate the
 When Rahul started his speech, he would have taken Mallikarjun Kharge before taking the name of Chief Minister Siddaramaiah
 aise main dalit siem ke taur par ve party alaakaman kii pehali pansad ban sakate hai
 Not only this, Rahul Gandhi is constantly trying to surround Narendra Modi and BJP government through the Dalit issue across the country
 siem banane par kya bole khadgemallikarjun khadge ne kaha, ''siddharmaiya se vichaar karke congress alaakaman jo bhi faisla karegaa, main usko sweekaar kar luungaa
 More than this, i do not want to say anything on this issue
 congress netaa khadge ne kaha, ''dalit ko mukhyamantri banaae jane ke siddharmaiya ke bayaan ko tod-marod kar pesh kiya gaya he
 The Congress high command will decide this in a meeting of the legislature party
 mahaj 12 ghante main hi chijen saaf ho jaaegi
 After this, what the high command will decide is acceptable to us
 6 saal kii umr main maa-baap ko khadge ne kho diya thakhadge raajnneeti main jameen se uthakar aae hai
 He has traveled from student life to political here
 6 saal kii umr main unhone apane mata-pita ko kho diya tha
 Describing this incident of his life, Kharge had said that i am now 76 years old and therefore consider these 70 years as extra in my life
 bataa den ki khadge ko kuch dhamkee bhare phone aa rahe the, ise lekar unhone kaha tha ki 'log sochate hai ki ve mujhe shant kar denge yaa mujhe meraa kaam karne se roak denge
 They should know that i probably would have died when i was six years old and my house caught fire
 mere mata-pita or duusare rishtedaaron kii maut ho gai thi
 For Kharge Congress, Trump's simplicity and outspokenness of Cordkharge is his biggest strength
 karnataka kii raajnneeti main itane lambey arase tak rahane ke baad bhi unke daaman par koi daag nahin he
 Not only this, Kharge can prove to be a profitable deal for Congress and Rahul's politics too
 desh main kareeb 14 fisadi dalit matadaata he

 He spoke exclusively about the film and himself, here are some excerpts from the same interview for you
 
 
 Film Review: aurat, dar or himmat
 
 
 Must watch is NH10 Anushkaaye 'NH10' to where is it? You have asked the question of general knowledge (laughs), though NH10 (national Highway number 10) starts from Gurgaon and finally ends in Haryana and Rajasthan
 is
 aisa kya tha is film main jisaki vajah se aapane acting ke saath saath produs karne kii bhi sochi?dekhie ye jo haive kii ghatana he ye kisi ke saath bhi ho sakati he, chaahe wo ladkaa ho yaa ladki, kyonki bure log kisi ke upar bhi hamalaa kar dete hai
 And i liked the same thing and i thought of producing along with acting
 mira ke kirdaar ke liye kuch khaas taiyaariyaan kii aapane?nahin (hansate hue), are main majaak kar rahi hum, script ke hisaab se mujhe khud ko bahut taiyaar karnaa tha, mujhe pataa tha ki 12 -12 ghante tak daudna hoga, to us hisaab se main puri taiyaari kar rahi thi
 We also did a workshop, because the film starts in 15 minutes
 apni urja ko kaayam rakhane ke liye aap kya kar rahi thim?maine interval training kii, jisamen bahut tej bhaagna hota he phir jatke se ruk jate hai, or yahi prakriya baar baar doharaani hoti he, to mumbai main maine apane trade mil par or shooting ke dauraan on lokation workout kiya
 Actor or producer, what work were you most excited about? Acting is natural for me and as a producer on set too many things have to be taken care of, so i enjoyed playing both roles
 honor kiling par aadhaarit aapaki film kya sachhee ghatnaon se prerit he?haa, film main kai aisi ghatnaayen hai jo sachhee kahaniyon se prerit hai, akhbaar main chhapi ghatnaon ko diarector navdeep or lekhak sudeep lekar aayaa karte the or hamaari film kii story main use prayog main laate the
 You did not fear that the film was affected by getting an 'A' certificate? While making the film we felt that a certificate could be obtained, and we did not take any pains while retaining the truth of the story, and every film anyway Not for everyone
 aapkaa ye sabase alag kirdaar he, apane comfort jone se hatakar aisa kirdaar karnaa, risk lene jaisaa nahin lagata?ek actor ke rup main maine hameshaa alag-alag tareeke ke kirdaaron ko kiya he or yahi kaaran he ki main bahut kaam filmein karti hum, is film kii kahani ne mujhe sabase zyaada prabhavit kiya or darshakon ke liye alag kism kii acting karne kaa mauka bhi mila
 i do not want to be part of the same type of films
 kya filmein aapke nijee zindagi ko bhi prabhavit karti hai ?ji haa, meri 90 % zindagi filmein hi hai, logon se milanaa, baaten karnaa, alag alag kirdaar karnaa, yahi jajba hota he ek actor kaa
 i am fortunate to have done films like PK and Bombay Velvet
 is film ke dauraan kya aapako chot bhi lagi ?haa, itani bhaag daud ke bich jab bhi main subah uthati thi, to alag hi chot mahasoos hoti thi, mujhe pataa bhi nahin chalata tha ki ye chot kab lagi
 By the way, a physiotherapist came from Jodhpur, so he used to take care of us all the time
 aap hi film kii hero or heroin donon hai, aapako nahin lagata ki sabase zyada bhaar aapke kandhon par he?dekhie log meri vajah se theatre tak to aa jaaenge lekin script agar gadabad hui to koi bhi nahin rukta, to kahani kaa ahm yogadan hota he
 The film is not made because of just one actor
 aap kisi kii biography kaa hissaa bananaa chahengi?haa, main biography karnaa chaahuungi
 Because if you get a chance to know a lot about a person, then i will definitely do biography, but whose, it cannot be told right now
 kya aapako ali abbaas zafer kii film ke liye bulaayaa gaya he?nahin, aisa kuch bhi nahin he

 mehakar ke shaarangdhar balaji ke darbar main jahaan balaji kaa divya rup bhakton ko abhibhoot karata he to vahiin vishnu sang brahma or mahesh ke darshan kar jivan dhanya ho jaataa he
 Brahma and Mahesh also sit along with Sarangadhar Balaji of Mehkar on the banks of the Mooladhana Pranitha river, 350 km from Nagpur
 ek saath teen devataaon ke darshan hi is mandir ko vishesh or adbhut bana dete hai
 The biggest feature of this temple is the 12 feet statue of Balaji, which is thousands of years old
 is mandir main aane vaale bhakton ko yahaan aakar ek alokik anubhuti hoti he, unki maane to yahaan aakar man ko shanti milti he or aatma ko tripti
 Also, the belief of fulfilling every vow sought from Tridev also brings devotees here
 susheel fatehrpura ek bhakt hai or kehete hai ki ye mandir jitna sundar he utana hi pracheen bhi he
 This temple is mentioned in the Padmapurana, Matsya Purana as well as in the Bhagavad Gita

 The most important thing is that here Lord Mata Lakshmi is seated along with Lord Vishnu, who is eyeing the feet of Lord Vishnu
 kehete hai yahaan darshan karne waalon par maa lakshmi kii krupa sadaiv bani rahati he
 Though Balaji i
e
 Vishnu sits everywhere alone, but this is the only temple where Lord Vishnu is seated with Mahalakshmi and where Mother Lakshmi is setting her eyes on the Lord's feet
 yani iskaa matlab saaf he ki jo bhi bhagwaan kii sharan main aata he usapar lakshmi prasann ho jaati hai
 In the temple of Dashavatar in the month of Sawan, the Lord's anointing starts in the morning and devotees come here for hours and recite Vishnu Sahastranam
 is paavan maheene main roj balaji ko nai poshaak pahanaakar unka shringaar kiya jaataa he
 The story of this temple is also mentioned in the Puranas
 kehete hai pranita nadi ke is tat par mehakar naamak ek rakshas rahata tha, jo shiv tapasya main leen rishi muniyon ko pareshaan kiya karata tha or unki tapasya main vighn baadhaaen daalaa karata tha
 In such a situation the troubled sages pleased Shiva and asked him the path to salvation
 tab shiv ji ne kaha ki iske sanhaar kaa shastr vishnu ji ke paas he, jise saarang kehete hai
 Then the sages did penance, pleased with which Vishnu killed the Mehkar with a bow like a sarang
 iske baad se is mandir ko mehakar ke saarangdhar balaji kaha jane laga
 In this temple also, the monolithic bow is seen in the idol of Lord Vishnu

 Akhilesh, who won the election commission in the elections, is at a peak in UP, the BJP is adopting a new strategy to counter him
 bijepi ne akhilesh se mukaable ke liye 4ji plan taiyaar kiya he
 BJP has 4G - Village, Gau, Ganga and Geeta
 mail today ko die ek exclusive intervyuu main bijepi kisaan morcha ke navaniyukt pramukh virendra singh 'mast' ne yah jaankaree di
 Virender Singh also said that farmers will remain at the center of bjp's agenda
 unhone kaha ki party 2014 kaa pradarshan phir se doharaana chaahati he, jab loksabhaa chunaav main pradesh main bijepi ne duusari partiyon kaa puri tarah se safaya kar diya tha
 Farmers will get Saugatupi MP from Bhadohi, Virender Singh indicated that the party's manifesto or vision document will be farmer-centric and there may be many gifts for the farming community even in the general budget being a profession by the central government
 gauratlab he ki haal main 31 disambar ko raashtra ke naam apane sandesh main pradhanmantri modi ne pehle hi kai saugaton kii ghoshnaa kii he
 Talking about the 4G strategy, Singh said that all aspects of the life of the Indian agricultural farmer are connected in it
 unhone kaha, 'gaanv vikaas ke centrebindu hai
 Similarly, GAU is definitely the center of rural life, especially the life of farmers
 ganga gaanvon kii jeevanarekha he, kyonki desh ke sabase upjau ganga ke maidan kaa bada hissaa iske jal se hi sinchit hota he
 Similarly, Gita is a symbol of Indian culture and spirituality
 'bijepi ko yah samaj main aa gaya he ki sapa ke ghamaasan main akhilesh yadav ko mili jeet se unki lokapriyata rajya main shikhar par he
 This has not made the path of UP assembly easy for BJP
 bijepi saal 2002 se hi rajya main satta se baahar he
 An alliance of SP and Congress may be announced soon, which will give a tough fight to BJP
 virendra singh ko lagata he ki 4ji formule se rajya main har jati-varg ke matadaataaon ke bich jagah banaai ja sakati he
 On the overall development of farmers, Jor Singh told Mail Today, 'we need to connect farmers with the identity of India
 unke vyapak vikaas or unnateekaran ke liye kaam karnaa hoga
 The Prime Minister has already emphasized that the progress of the country depends on the progress and prosperity of the farmers
 unke bina tikaoo vikaas nahin ho saktaa
 The lives of farmers have to be upgraded not only economically but also socially, culturally and politically
 'sansad-vidhansabhaon main pahunchen kisaanaunhone kaha ki raajnneeti main kisaanon kii bhagidaari badhaani hogi
 He said, 'I have suggested to the government that farmers should be appointed as MLC and Rajya Sabha MP
 kisaanon kaa pratinidhitiv kisaan hi karen na ki bahari log jo chunaav jeetne ke liye paisa phenkate hai
 He said that in the coming days, the government can give a gift to the farmers who provide raw material to the protected industries
 sarkaar agle teen chaar-saal main daalon kaa aayaat puri tarah se band karnaa chaahati he
 Similarly, steps can be taken to promote irrigation with solar energy
 sarkaar ek bilkul nayaa lokapal bill taiyaar kar rahi he, jo lokapal or jan lokapal ke bill se alag hoga
 The government is trying to create a new post of director in CBI, which will be the post of director procedure
 is pad par niyukti pradhanmantri, vipaksh ke netaa or lokapal milakar karenge
 The Lokpal bill will not be discussed in the cabinet meeting to be held today
 ab aaj kii baithak main sirf khaadya suraksha bill par hi charchaa hogi
 Probably another cabinet meeting will be held tomorrow, in which the Lokpal bill can be discussed
 isse pehle, pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne moscow se lautate hue kaha tha ki centre sarkaar puri eemaandaaree se ye koshish kar rahi he ki is satr main yah bill paas ho jaae
 Manmohan Singh has said that the government is engaged in finalizing the Lokpal bill day and night
 anna hajaare ke sarkaar par nishane ke baavjood manmohan ne bharosa jataayaa ki is satr main bill paas ho jayega
 Manmohan said, we are making every effort to pass the Lokpal bill in this session
 ham din-raat kaam karke bill kii ruparekha taiyaar karne main jute hai
 But we do not know what will happen after the bill comes before Parliament
 unhone aage kaha, "ek baat jarur kahuunga ki bill ko paas karaane kii ham puri eemaandaaree se koshish kar rahe hai, is par kisi ko koi shaq nahin hona chahie
 " dilli main arvind kejariwal nit AAP sarkaar ke kaam kaam par niyantrak evam mahalekha pareekshak (CAG) kii report vidhansabha main rakhi gai
 In this report, the CAG has raised serious questions on the advertisements of the Kejriwal government
 CAG ne kai vigyapanon ko tathyaatmak rup se galat or guidelins ke khilaaf bataaya he
 These questions were raised in this CAG report: Delhi government has replaced the 'delhi government' with Kejriwal government in its TV ads and 5 on these advertisements
 38 karod rupee kharch kiye gaye
 In February 2016, the government advertised in 26 national and 37 regional newspapers in 14 states
 in vigyapanon main 'aap sarkaar kaa safal ek saal' likhaa gaya
 Facts were given incorrectly in advertisements
 sarkaar ne fliover nirmaan main paise bachane kaa daawa kiya, jabaki nirmaan kaam baaki tha or jo antim laagat bataayi gai vah anumaan tha, na ki kul laagat
 Similarly, another advertisement claimed that the dispensary which used to be made for 5 crores, is now being built at a cost of 20 lakh rupees
 jabaki iske saport main koi tathy nahin diya gaya
 When asked about the Health Director this time, he said that no new dispensary was formed in 2015-16, so no comparison can be made
 dilli sarkaarne vigyaapan jari karte vakt uske prabhaav kaa adhyayan nahin kiya, uske phaayde soche bina vigyaapan die gaye
 33 on print, TV and radio
 40 karod rupee kharch kar jari kiye vigyapanon main dilli se sambandhit vigyapanon par sirf 4
 69 crores was spent, while 28 on advertisements in other states
 71 karod kharch hue
 With this, the CAG has also questioned the creation of a semantic agency in its report
 report ke mutabik, sarkaar ne jis 15 fisadi kamishan ko bachaane ke liye shabdaarth banaai thi, vah bhi nahin bachaa or shabdaarth kaa kharchaa alag se bad gaya

 somvaar ko dilli ke siri fort auditorium pahunchnaa shandaar anubhav rahaa
 Usually there is a lot of traffic on this route
 magar is dfa aisa nahin tha
 But the scene changed as soon as it reached outside the auditorium
 vahaan jamaa bheed ek nai kahani ke shuruaati harf gadhati najar aa rahi thi
 The story received a great illustrious and world-famous Kissago
 uske kahan kii
 Which is named Dan Brown
 yah ek mishrit jutav tha
 Teenagers, their parents, groups of college students and literary people of different ages had arrived here
 unke haathon main entry paas tha or ve qatari main lage shaam ke jawan hone kaa intjaar kar rahe the
 What engulfed Fiza were discussions of plot, character and writing style
 sabhi kii sabhi us ek shaks par kendrit, jiskaa naam dan brown hota he
 This brilliant writer of novels like 'the Vinci Code' and 'angels and Demons' was in India
 jalsa tha penguin random house kaa salanaa lacture
 Monday was the name of the people of Delhi and they were eager to listen to the person who had gathered at Siri Fort
 jo thodi-bahut udaasi kahin thi to vah entry paas na milane or event main shaamil na ho paane kii thi
 You could not experience the amount of affection and respect of the people who were inside before that legend came on stage
 sorry@penguinindiaand Dan Brown
 Took 1 look at humongous line waiting to get in & turned back
 Disappointed
 # danbrownvisitsindia — Christine Pemberton (@christinedelhi) November 10, 2014 The excited crowd entering the auditorium was pacified by a montage of Brown's photographs

 Due to this brand, he got that great reception

 He told how his mother and organist and father of mathematics, who played organics in the church, became interesting to him day by day
 baton kaa pendulum dharm or vigyaan ke bich dulaate hue brown ne bataaya ki sawaal poochna unhone bahut pehle hi sikh liya tha
 And then he told this anecdote, 'once i went to the priest and asked that science and the Bible tell us different things, then what is right? The priest said, 'good children do not ask such questions
 'unki kitabon ke kalevar se parichit pathak unke is jivananubhav se aanandit ho gaye
 Brown said that the most encouraging time is the one where the lines between religion and science begin to blur
 vah logon se jindagi kii ghatnaon kii khub chaanbin karne ke liye prerit karte hai
 He says, 'when i look at the world around me, it is difficult for me to believe that this must have happened by chance
 'vastuon-ghatnaon ke astitv kii padtaal ke liye unhone vigyaan or dharm ko ek saath explor karne kii baat kahi
 In his 30-minute statement, he kept the people present in the auditorium under hypnosis
 iske baad unhone logon ke sawaalon kaa jawaab diya or darshakon ko sabase zyada anand isi main aayaa
 When will Langdon come to India? ’be patient
 ' apane bhartiya phans ko aashwast karte hue dan brown ne kaha, 'mujhe aapke dharm or puranic kathaon ke bare main bahut kuch padhanaa he
 Right now i am here (in India) for starters
 'kya aapane bhartiya mahakavy masalan ramayana yaa mahabharat padhe hai?nahin, ab tak to nahin
 Actually both of these are very big
 aapke nowell ke shuruaati 5 pannon main ek hatya ho hi jaati he?main chahta hum ki mere pathak mujhe kosen ki maine unka kaam par janaa or sona haraam kar diya he

 Be Good Writer Salman Rushdie once said about Brown's book, 'the Vinci Code', 'it is such a bad book that it describes bad books as good
 ' kaarykram ke moderator ne brown se jab is bare main poocha to yah bestsaling lekhak ek adad muskaan ke saath bolaa, 'vah ek achche aadmi hai

 50 lakh rupee elidi lite sorce, 25 lakh keemat kii shadoles lamp, 20 lakh rupee kii keemat vaali do intensive care unit ventilator or 20 lakh rupee keemat kii ek neurodrill mashin shaamil he
 Jio: Now the prime offer after Happy New Year, these are Mukesh Ambani's big all-in-one medical equipment and accessories to be used by SSST in the multi-specialty Shree Sainath Hospital in Shirdi in Ahmednagar district
 unhone bataaya ki isse ambani ke janmdin par shraddhaluon ko shri sai prasadalay ke rup main muft bhojan muhaiyaa karaane ke liye 4 lakh rupee daan ke rup main praapt hue hai
 Cheap 4G or Cheap Data? Know what is the real meaning of Mukesh Ambani, devotees from all over the country are provided food at huge discount in the huge dining room attached to the temple in Saibaba temple
 mukhyamantri jagadish shettar ne kaha ki karnataka abhi tamilnadu ke liye kaveri jal nahin chhod paayegaa kyonki rajya sookhe or peyajal kii baari killat kaa saamana kar rahaa he
 He said at his residence here, "it is not possible for the government to release Cauvery water to Tamil Nadu as the state is facing drought and acute shortage of drinking water
" ’shettar ne kaha ki rajya se ek sarvadaleey shishtmandal somvaar ko nai dilli jaakar pradhanmantri manmohan singh se mulaakaat karegaa
 The delegation will request them not to notify the proposed final decision of the Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal
 unhone bataaya ki is shishtmandal main rajya ke saansad, kendriya mantri evam vipaksh ke netaa shaamil honge
 The delegation will try to satisfy Singh that he has not been notified of the final decision as there is a huge problem of drinking water and drought before the state
 mukhyamantri ne kaha, ‘in samasyaon ke baavjood hamaari sarkaar ne ucchtam nyaayalay ke aadesh kaa paalan karte hue tamilnadu ke liye pani jari kiya he
 But now it is no longer possible for us to release water in the current situation
 ’ Idealistic people are never satisfied
 ve hameshaa shuddhtar chizon par jor dete rahete hai
 If we remember Churchill, it seems that there is no longer any debate on democracy

 Despite this, the search for 'total democracy' still continues among the idealists

 Purity can only be found in heaven, on earth there are only ways to take it into the pit of collapse
 or agar ye raste bharat main hon, to un par chalane main badboo bhi aati he
 For example, the beginning of an election is such that a leader chooses a candidate on his own
 matadaata ko chune hue logon main se hi chunanaa he
 Here merit does not matter, firstly loyalty, then caste-region constraints
 jaise-jaise yah rasta vishesh logon ke liye arakshit jagah raashtrapati bhawan kii ore badhata he, jatiltaayen badhati jaati hai
 It is just a matter of pleasure that the election process emerges as an interesting story in itself
 chunane vaala jitna tangadimag hoga, chunaav bhi utane hi tang honge
 If the people of India were choosing their President, the picture would have been quite clear - the candidate of the ruling party would have lost
 lekin yahaan vot saansadon-vidhayakon ko daalane hai or chunki puraa rajnatik varg hi avyavasthit he, lihaaja raashtrapati kaa chunaav vyavasthit kaise ho saktaa he
 No one has the number force
 congress ab bhi khamakhyali main he ki vah logon ke gusse ke paar surakshit rahegi, halaat apane niyantran main rakhegi, bas shrimati gandhi kii jaadu kii chadi ghoomane kii deree he
 Mulayam Singh Yadav and Mamta Banerjee have actually taken away the magic from this stick
 unhone congress ko yah jataa diya he ki aseemit shakti devataaon ke maamle main sahi ho sakati he, lekin par inasaani maamalon main aisa nahin hota
 There are no accidents in politics
 raashtrapati abdul kalam kaa naam achaanak nahin uchhla he
 The boomers knew that the NDA wanted to bring Kalam back but did not have the capability, so the strategy was tight
 unhone upie ke singhaasana ke neeche dynamide laga diya he
 Mulayam has a fuse of this dynamide and a stick in Mamta's hand
 congress kisi keemat par unhen sweekaar nahin kar sakati
 His argument is also very decent
 kalam par aam raay bhi banati he or raashtrapati pad kii garima bhi batch jaati he
 DMK, an important ally of the UPA, cannot forget that Kalam is Tamil, just as Shiv Sena accepted Marathi Pratibha Patil five years ago
 sharad pavaar lagaataar aam raay par jor de rahe the
 But keep in mind that consent does not mean unanimous consent
 congress ne mugalate main hakeekat ko dekhne se inkaar kar diya
 Eight years in power is a long time
 use to yah samajhane main bhi vakt laga ki mulaayam-mamata ne manmohan kaa naam kyon liya
 Within hours of Sonia getting some relief, the Prime Minister herself turned down this option
 yah unka apana faisla tha
 But by then, Mulayam's spokesperson had told the country on TV that he wanted to send Manmohan to the upper chair so that a capable man could sit in the Prime Minister's chair
 unhone azim premaji kaa hawala diya jinhone upie ko netavihin qaraar diya tha
 The signs are clear
 sapa or trinmul congress ab sansad main manmohan sarkaar ke saath khadey nahin hone vaale-basharte aglaa satr ham dekh paaen
 The Congress was also oblivious to the political whispers
 yah jo tamaasha ham dekh rahe hai, ek nahin do chunaavon ke liye ho rahaa he
 The two strategies are running parallel and can cut each other anytime
 duusari ranneeti zyada ahm he-agle aam chunaav kii ranneeti

 Sanjay Kumar, a 27-year-old Dalit youth of Basai Baba village in Hathras district of western Uttar Pradesh, has been asking these questions to everyone for the past few months
 har sarkari daftar ko unhone is sandarbh main chitthee likhi he, chaahe wo local police kaa inspector ho yaa rajya kaa dijipi, mukhyamantri se lekar essi-asti kamishan or sthaneey media ko bhi unhone patr likhaa he, yahi nahin unhone soshal media par video jari kar logon se madad maangi he, taaki ve apni baraat thakur bahul apni dulhan ke gaanv main le ja saken
 On March 15, Sanjay Kumar approached the Allahabad High Court in this regard
 sanjay kumaar kehete hai, 'samvidhan kahata he ki ham sab barabarahain, or mukhyamantri yogi adityanath kehete hai ki ham sab hindu hai
 He is the head of a Hinduist party
 phir hamen aisi sthiti kaa saamana kyon karnaa pad rahaa he
 Kumar, a member of the Block Development Council, asks, 'am i not a Hindu? a constitution-driven country cannot have different rules for the people
 'kumaar kii shaadi main keval 20 din hi bache hai, lekin samasya kaa koi hal nahin dikh rahaa he
 Last week, District Magistrate RP Singh along with SP Piyush Srivastava visited the bride's village Nizamabad
 nizamabad kansgaj jile ke pados main he
 The two officials also visited the route through which Sanjay Kumar wants to take his procession
 lekin thakuron ke dabaav main singh ne raste par baraat le jane kii anumati nahin di
 The District Magistrate has not allowed the procession, citing the drains, litter and its width on the way
 adhikariyon ne is baat kaa bhi pataa lagaaya ki kya isse pehle bhi jatvon (sheethal or sanjay isi jati ke hai) ne kabhi shahi baraat nikaali he
 But no such example was found
 aise main unhone sheethal ke parivaar waalon ko salaah di ki sheethal kii baraat usee paaramparik raste se aegi, jisase abhi tak daliton kii baraat aati rahi he
 He has asked the Thakurs to ensure that the roads remain clear
 indian express ke mutabik police ne is sambandh main 11 jatvon or thakuron se is sambandh main bond par hastakshar karwaae he ki maamle main koi bhi kanoon apane haath main nahin legaa
 The Thakurs have assured all possible help
 lekin nizamabad ke bahari ilaake main rahane vaala sheethal ke parivaar ne, gaanv ke anya chaar jatav pariwaron kii tarah hi is maamle main ladaai ko anjaam tak pahunchane kaa man bana liya he
 Madhubala, Sheetal's mother, says, "it is with our respect, we would like to welcome the groom with all his pride and also that the groom came on horseback
" gaanv kii sadaken utani hi hamaari hai, jitani kii thakuron kii
 The tussle over the "tension that began with the rise of the Jatavs" escalated when the Jatavs in the village of Thakurs with 90 percent of the population in 45 families began to dominate
 bispi ke vot bank maane jane vaale jatvon main sheethal ke parivaar ke sabhi log bispi main hai
 In the second week of March, the Thakurs stopped watering the Jatavs' fields
 or badale main 100 rupee prati ghante ke hisaab se pani dene lage
 Along with this, Thakurs also took out Sheetal's certificate and said that he is only 17 years old and 10 months old
 sanjay kumaar kehete hai ki agar aisa he to ham sheethal ke 18 saal puure karne tak shaadi ko do maheene taal bhi sakate hai
 Thakur Kanti Devi, the head and caste of the village, admits that he opened the water of the Jatav fields only after the arrival of the DM
 wo aage kahati hai, 'hamen koi dikkat nahin he, ladki kii shaadi ho, thakur logon ko koi allergy nahin he
 The problem is that someone will forcefully come on our way and break the wall
 jab kabhi baraat hamaare raste se nikali nahin he, to kyun vivaad vaala kaam kar rahe hai wo
 "dalits do not cross their boundary," says Thakur Sanjay Singh, "thakurs and district administration have explained to them that they understand the root of the case
 hamane unhen kaha he ki ve ab ek nai cheez na shuru karen
 Their limits are fixed and they stay within the same boundary
 'oonchi jati ke district magistrate sanjay singh apane bayaan se tus-mas hone ko taiyaar nahin he
 They say that the two communities should not fight among themselves
 ve hindu or muslim nahin hai
 Both communities are Hindus
 musalamaanon kii tarah hinduon kii shaadi samjhauta nahin he, wo ek bhaavana he, jisamen juluus kaa koi matlab nahin he
 It is clear that the Jatavs want to fight
 ham parampara nahin badal sakate
 BJP MLA Devender Singh, who is a Thakur by profession, says, 'kumar should come to me for advice
 lekin wo ladkaa netagiri kar rahaa he
 i will get her married in a mass marriage with government money
 wo jor dekar kehete hai ki agar aap kisi ke raste main aaenge, to jhagada hoga hi
 'the wishes of Dalits are suppressed: BSP leader BSP leader Ajay Kumar says the administration has done nothing

 The recent large recruitments in many big government institutes of the country have become part of the controversy
 aane vaale samay main IIMC ke diarector kaa chunaav bhi hona he
 Due to the changing media environment and new technologies, there is a demand of students that a director should come who can meet the current demands of students and journalism
 isi silsile main hamane patrakarita ke field main lanbaa anubhav rakhane vaale patrkaar or lekhak ram bahadur raay se baat kii
 What kind of director do you want in IIMC? This institute is working as an autonomous organization
 sarkaar main ek najariya bana hua he ki sarkaar ise jaise chalaanaa chaahe, vaisaa chalaae or isamen narendra modi kii sarkaar apwaad nahin he
 This has been going on since the beginning
 1990-91 main prasar bharti bana lekin aaj tak yah swytt santhaan kii tarah kaam nahin kar paa rahaa he
 i would say that in a way Prasar Bharati was not born
 prasar bharti ko sarkari afasar chalaate hai
 Any Director General (DG) should come to IIMC, it should be good for the students
 uski maujuudagi mahaj khanaapurti naa ho

 kya sarkaar diji bhartee main bhi raajnneeti karegi?dekhie, FTII ke udhaaharan se sarkaar kuch to seekhegi
 i have high hopes from two people from the selection committee, Swapan Das Gupta and Rajat Sharma
 rajat ek media institute chalaa rahe hai or swapan das gupta ek achche patrkaar rah chuke hai
 Rajat is one of the people who set up the institute for his hard work
 is vajah se mujhe lagata he ki ye log nishchit hi behatar nirnay karenge
 a total of 36 names have gone, 12 of them have been shortlisted
 chayan main patrakarita ke anubhav ko mukhya aadhaar banaaya jayega
 Most of the students studying at IIMC want their campus placement done? Will the incoming dgs be able to fulfill this demand of the students? Among all the media houses under the Government of India, the students here should get priority because there is a dire need of people doing good work in government media houses
 isliye yah niyam bane kishiinchh ke studentsko sarkari media houseej main naukari mili
 By doing this, as many journalists will be born in the market as there should be, and such institutes will also be closed which are sitting in the name of teaching journalism
 koi isliye to patrakarita ke institute main ja nahin rahaa he ki use naagarik patrakarita yani citigen jarnalism karnaa he
 Nowadays the role models of journalism students are TV anchors
 placement kii jarurat to he hi students ko, or ise puraa bhi kiya janaa chahie
 Prasar Bharati should have a recruitment board of its own as most of the people are on deputation here
 agar recruitment board banegaa to saare log apane department main waapas jaaenge or patrakarita ke kshetra main kaam karne vaale logon ko mauka milegaa
 IIMC is going to be a university in the near future
 kya aapako lagata he ki yah ek acchhee uniwarsity ke rup main ubhar paaegaa ?sabase pehle to uniwarsity banane kii ghoshnaa hui he
 What happens next will be seen
 kul milakar patrakarita kii padhai kaa jo str bana he, usamen baari giravat ai he
 This institute could have become an example that education should be done like this
 agar arun jetali uniwarsity kii baat kar rahe hai to sambhav he ki unke dimag main yahaan shaikshanik sudhaar chal rahaa ho
 He will implement it gradually
 lekin abhi mujhe nahin lagata ki IIMC sarkari santhaan kii bajaay patrakarita kaa swytt santhaan ban sakegaa
 Institutions are made up of a concept
 institution kaa bananaa ek prakriya hoti he, us prakriya se ham log kai kaarnon se hat gaye hai
 Therefore, there should be universities connected to the center, there are commissions attached to states
 vah un logon ke adde ban gaye hai, jinhen is bare main kuch bhi pataa nahin
 There is still hope from the students here because there is a written test to enroll here

 The police also argued that the law was changed in the country after the December 16 gang-rape and if the victim's statements were repeated, the entire exercise would be in vain
 justise jees khehar kii agavaai vaali bench ne kaha tha ki aap jis kanoon ke tahat dobaaraa jirah kar rahe hai, uske tahat duusare bhi uskaa beja istemaal kar sakate hai
 The court said that the accused is the master of the legal claim and he played the best claim punches in the court to twist the case
 aisi yojana taiyaar kii jo cab driver ke liye mumkin nahin
 The comments supreme court ke jaj hone ke baavjood aisa hamaare dimag main bhi nahin aata
 It is clear that someone else is giving accurate legal advice to the accused
 jiske tahat trial main vakeelon ko badalane se lekar gavaahon ko dobaaraa jirah ke liye bulaayaa gaya
 The accused spent only time for several months, delaying the trial
 aaropee ne peedita ko baar-baar pratadit kiya

 haal hi main ek research ke baad yah jaankaree saamne ai ki zyaadaatar puja-paath main istemaal hone vaali sugandhit agarbatti or dhupabatti sehat ke lihaaj se khatarnaak hoti he
 After the results of the research, people are confused about what to use instead of incense sticks at the time of worship? Actually, research has shown that the smoke emitted from incense sticks and sunburns has a bad effect on the cells of the body and It also proves to be more toxic than cigarette smoke
 shodhakartaaon ne paaya ki iske dhuen se koshikaon ke DNA main badlaav hota he, jisase cancer kaa khatra bad jaataa he
 Although the top companies making incense sticks in India claim that research can be true about China's incense, but not about the incense of India
 inkaa daawa he ki bharat kii agarbattiyon kii supplai kai deshon main hoti he, jahaan inhen kade test se guzarana padataa he
 Whatever may be the reality, but there is a need to be conscious about it
 dhuaan har haal main fefde ke liye khatarnaak hi hota he, yah chaahe cigarette se nikle yaa agarbatti se
 In such a situation, it is important to find an alternative
 bharat main pracheen kaal se hi prakritik taur par uplabdh sugandhit lakadiyon kaa istemaal hota rahaa he
 Sandalwood, agar, tagar etc
 are prominent among such wood
 ye mahangi jarur hoti hai, par chemical se rahit hone kii vajah se sehat ke liye hanikaarak nahin hai
 The dependence on incense sticks and incense sticks can be reduced by using flowers that are readily available nearby or can be planted in home pots
 vaise antim satya chaahe jo bhi ho, par nuksaan se pehle hi sachet ho jane main hi zyada samajhadaari he

 sawaalon se behaal nirmal baba ne ab bhakton ko apni dhaal bana liya he
 The issues related to Nirmal Baba were in his recent conferences and devotees were seen giving him clarification

 There are about 8 months left for the next Lok Sabha election, but the Congress has started preparing for it right now
 pichley maheene congress adhyaksharahul gandhi congress kaary samiti (seedblusi) kaa gathan kiya tha or ab usne loksabhaa chunaav ke liye kor group kamity kaa elaan kar diya he
 Comparing the CWC and the Core Group Committee (CGC), it is clear that 48-year-old party president Rahul Gandhi gave a lot of experience with youthful vigor in an orcwc, but the youth group in the core group committee set up for the next general election Experience is given more priority than 9 main se 6 netaa seedblusi main bhiloksabhaa chunaav ke liegathit kor group kamitimen 9 diggaj netaaon ko rakhaa gaya he
 Of these 9 people, 6 are those who are also included in the 23-member CWC
 seedblusi se itar is group main 3 alag logon ko shaamil kiya gaya he
 These 3 new people are former finance ministers p Chidambaram, Jairam Ramesh and Randeep Surjewala
 kor group kamity or seedblusi donon main shaamil shesh 6 diggaj netaa hai eke antni, gulam nabi aaazaad, ashok gahalot, mallikarjun khadge, ahamed patel or kasee venugopal

 rahul gandhi purv congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ke raajnneetik salaahkaar ahamed patel ko apane netritv main khaas jagah di he
 Patel has been included in this core committee apart from CWC
 isse jaahir hota he ki rahul kaa un par bharosa kaayam he
 If 7 leaders look at the Parcore Group Committee of 60, Rahul Gandhi has expressed more confidence in experience than on youth
 randeep surajevaala (51) or kasee venugopal (55) ko chhod diya jaae to kamity main shaamil anya netaa kii umr yaa to 70 ke kareeb he yaa phir uske paar he
 An Antony, a former defense minister in the committee, is the oldest leader whose age is 77 years
 iske alaava mallikarjun khadge (76) or pi chidambaram (72) do anya 70 paar netaa hai
 While Ghulam Nabi Azad (69), Ahmed Patel (69) and Ashok Gehlot (67) are also close to 70

 The core group committee constituted for the election is full of elderly leaders, so when the Congress comes down to face the pair of Narendra Modi and Amit Shah with their elderly warlords in the general elections next year, it will be interesting to see that Congress Modi- with the help of old shoulders How will they face Shah's aggressive duo and where does the party ultimately stay

 In noida-greater Noida, it has become common to see a scene in delhi-ncr on Saturday and Sunday
 vahiin kharidaaron kaa hujum bilderon ke daftaron ke saamne pahunchataa he or shor-sharaaba karata he or shaam ko waapas ho jaataa he
 His weekend vacation culminates in demonstrations, picketing and slogans
 aath-das saal se iemai chukaate hue makaan kii raah johte hue in logon ke jivan kaa jaise yah hissaa ban gaya ho
 Due to their struggle, real estate act was created and also implemented
 lekin rajyon ke lachar ravaiye ke chalate iskaa phayda makaan ke kharidaaron ko nahin mil sakaa
 It may take more time now
 darasal, taqatvar builder lobby kii vaadakhilaphi se logon ko bachaane ke liye kendriya kanoon real estate(regulation and deveopment)act 2016 yani rera 1 may se lagu ho gaya
 But in more than half the states, the rules of the Act have not been notified
 madhya pradesh or maharashtra ke alaava kisi bhi rajya main real estate regulatory athurity nahin bani he
 Without it, it is not going to get much benefit
 athurity yani kharidaaron kaa shikaayat karne kaa manch jab tak har rajya main nahin hoga, tab tak yah kanoon bematlab he
 Union Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation Minister Venkaiah Naidu says that all incomplete projects have been asked to be registered within three months as buyers' problems are mostly related to half-finished projects
 mantralay niyamit rup se monitering kar rahaa he
 To implement the Act effectively, several letters have been written to the Chief Ministers and Administrators of the states
 rajya sarkarein bhi janata ke dabaav ko mahasoos kar rahi hai
 Things will change soon
 ensiaar main baari asamanjaslekin sankhya ke lihaaj se desh ke sabase bade real estate market rashtriya rajdhani kshetra(ensiaar) main rerapara kaaphi asamanjas he
 UP has notified rules but has not created authority and draft rules have been issued for Haryana
 is vajah se noida, gajiabad, gudgaanv or faridabad main builder peedit kharidaaron kaa haal jas kaa tas he
 Abhishek Kumar, president of the 32,000-member Noida Extension Flat Owner Welfare Association, says about 4 in noida-greater Noida itself
 5 lakh kharidaar fanse hue hai
 The association has demanded from Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath that the weak real estate rules notified at the time of the old Akhilesh government be changed and the Centre's law should be enforced
 uttar pradesh kii pichhali sarkaar ne under construction project ko iske daayre se baahar kar diya tha
 On this issue, he has asked the Chief Minister to change the inferior rules of the old government
 mukhyamantri ne bharosa diya he ki kanoon halkaa nahin hone diya jayega
 At the same time, noida-greater Noida CEO Amit Mohan says that according to the instructions of the Department of Industrial Development, new provisions will be implemented
 baharhaal upi main athurity gathit nahin hui he
 The question is also whether the authority will be formed in Lucknow or in Noida? Keep in mind that the largest number of flats and buyers are in Noida
 saaf kaam karne vaale hi market main rahenge - amit modilekin bilderon kii sanstha cridai real estate act ko lekar bilkul sashankit nahin he
 CREDAI Vice President Amit Modi says one rule has to be followed
 sarkaar yah kanoon isliye laai he
 So that the common man gets a house on time and the builder should work within the scope of the rules
 saaf kaam karne vaale builder demand main rahenge
 The dirt that is in the market will be cleared in three years and the builder will be out to raise money by launching the project overnight
 uttar pradesh main RERA ke niyamon main 65 fisadi registration puraa kar chuke he or ardblue ko saunpe ja chuke project ko act ke tahat panjikaran karaane kii jarurat nahin he or under construction project ko panjikaran karana hi hoga
 The builder will be scared because it has a provision for punishment
 noida main kharidaaron ke ek andolan kaa netritv karne vaale amrapali hartbeet ke punit parashar kehete hai, nae kharidaaron ke liye RERA acha he lekin das saal pehle makaan book kara chuke jin logon ke andolan or maang parakeshaishabana unako iskaa phayda hota nahin dikh rahaa he
 If the disturbing projects launched around 2010 will come under its purview, then even if there is no strict punishment, you will be saved by paying 10% penalty
 yah kanoon kaa lacheelaapan he
 Projects launched in 2007-08 and after in delhi-ncr and Noida have not yet received delivery
 upi jaisaa hi haal desh main daamon ke lihaaj se sabase bade real estate market maharashtra kaa bhi he jahaan niyam deelein hai
 For amendment in the plan, the consent of the last plan has been made by removing the consent of two-third buyers, which is being said to be favorable to the builders
 sarkari vibhaagon kii jimmedaari tay nahiilder kehete hai ki act kaa ek hi nakaaratmak bindu he jo ki isamen sarkari sansthaaon ko shaamil nahin kiya gaya he, na unki koi jimmedaari tay kii gai he
 At the same time, the government takes the land from the farmers and the builder buys it through a tender
 iske baavjood ek project ke liye jameen lene ke baad builder ko do darjan se zyada manzooriyaan lene main do saal lag jate hai
 This increases the cost
 gajiabad ke vakil ramanand goyal kehete hai ki builder super aria ke naam par luutaten hai
 If there is a need to specify the carpet area, the builder will increase the rate
 sarkaar 20 fisadi kahati he par builder 40 fisadi tak karpet aria main katautee kar dete hai
 This law has been brought to benefit large builders
 RERA se badhiya upabhokta forum - di
 K
 gargavahin supreme court ke vakil di
 K
 garg kehete hai ki yah bhavishya kaa kanoon he
 The current builder victims are of no use
 RERA athurity se zyada taqatvar upabhokta forum he jisamen penalty se lekar jail bhejne tak kaa adhikaar he
 With the release of the rule notification, it is difficult to implement RERA nationwide without creating infrastructure
 maujuuda halaat ko dekhte hue iske amal main kareeb ek saal lag saktaa he
 Election states may take longer
 crisil research kii diarector binafar jehani kahati hai ki nae laanch par RERA kaa asar tatkaal dikhegaa
 The consumer will get confidence and transparency will come when the law is fully implemented
 logon ko makaan vakt par milane kaa bharosa milegaa
 Uncertainty will be eliminated from the market which will have positive effect
 baharhaal, RERA ko tabhi kaamyaab kaha jayega jab kharidaaron ko nyaay milen, makaan milen or unakon iskaa phayda milen
 Bollywood actor Amitabh Bachchan and his daughter Shweta have reached the hospital to meet former SP leader and MP Amar Singh, arrested in the Cash for Vote case and admitted in AIIMS on interim bail

 Tourists are troubled by the terror of monkeys at the World Heritage Taj Mahal
 inke aatank se nipatane main puraa agra prashasan asahaay ho gaya he
 People are constantly getting injured due to monkey attacks
 yahaan tak ki agra kaa jila prashasan inaki nasbandi par 1 karod 86 lakh rupye kharch kar chukaa helekin halaat jas ke tas hai
 The cage has also been installed to catch the monkeys but it does not seem to have any benefit
 agra ke purv sambhageeya kamishnar ke
 Wildlife SOS NGO carried out the program of sterilization of monkeys on the orders of Ram Mohan Rao
 isamen sirf 500 bandaron kii hi nasbandi ho pai
 The cost of a monkey's surgery was 37 thousand rupees, which became expensive even by human surgery
 jis jagah se bandar pakade gaye, us lokation par unhen choda bhi nahin gaya balki kisi duusari jagah par choda gaya
 This also made the monkeys aggressive
 vanyajeev esoes ne ab ek rivizd plan prashasan ko bheja he jisamen 10 hajaar bandaron kii nasbandi hone kii baat kahi gai he
 It has been estimated to cost 3 crores rupees
 haalanki iske liye van vibhaag ne enosi nahin di he
 The Forest Department has claimed that they had asked some questions to this NGO whose answers they have not yet received
 mukhya van sarankshak javed akhtar ne kaha ki 1 karod 86 lakh rupye kharch ke baad bhi agra jile main bandaron ke hamalon kii sankhya kam nahin hui he
 This data shows that the number of monkeys is continuously increasing and the efforts of ngos to control the monkeys are becoming insufficient
 ab van vibhaag is baat kaa intjaar kar rahaa he enjio, bandaron ke pakadaney or unke oparation kii report de to phir enosi dene ke bare main sochaa jayega
 NGO said, how to leave the monkeys not only caged, the wildlife SOS in Himachal Pradesh also claimed that after 2007, 1 lakh monkeys have been sterilized and every year 20 thousand monkeys are undergoing surgery but there are also monkeys The number of could not be controlled
 enjio ne apana bachaav karte hue daawa kiya ki bandaron kii nasbandi ke baad agra nagar nigam ko inhen shahar ke baahar dur ke ilaakon main chhodana tha lekin bandaron ko pakadaney vaale pinjre enjio ko die hi nahin gaye, balki ve nagar nigam ke godaam main hi rakhe hue hai
 Because of this, the problem remains as it is
 gauratlab he ki may 2018 main agra main tajmahal ko dekhne pahunche do videshi paryatak bandaron ke aatank kaa shikaar ho gaye the
 The monkeys attacked the crowd present at the Taj Mahal
 paryatak kuch samaj pate isse pehle hi bandaron ne ek videshi mahila paryatak ke pair main kaat liya
 After this, another tourist was attacked by the monkeys
 madhyapradesh main uniwarsities or institutes ko tambaakoo varjit kshetra ghoshit karne kii kavayad chal rahi he
 In this connection, the Higher Education Department of the state has also issued instructions
 pradesh ke sabhi uniwarsities or institutes ko jari kiye gaye ek nirdesh main kaha gaya he ki shaikshanik sansthaanon ke 100 gaj daayre main tambaakoo utpaadon kii bikri par roak ho
 Information boards of Tobacco Free Zone should be set up outside institutions
 iske saath hi pratibandhit kshetra main dhumrapaan evam tambaakoo kii briki hote paae jane par 200 rupee tak kaa jurmaana lagaaya jaae
 Higher Education Commissioner Sachin Sinha said that about 50 lakh people a year in the world and about 1 million people die annually due to tobacco related diseases in India
 global youth tobaco survey 2009 ke anusaar, bharat main 13 se 15 saal kii aayu ke 14 pratishat se adhik bachche tambaakoo seven kii lat ke shikaar hai
 The continued decline in gold prices for the last 15 days seems to be reinforced due to jewelery demand
 global bazaar main keemton main lagaataar duusare din ijapha hone se desh main jewalers dwaara sone kii kharid main bhi ijapha ho rahaa he
 However, for the consumer, the jewelery market still remains the same
 jaankaron kaa yahaan tak maananaa he ki sone kii keemton main vaishvik giravat ke mutabik kanjumar ko jewelery kharidne main utana phayda nahin milegaa jitna vah soch rahe hai
 Gold prices rose by Rs 90 and silver by Rs 150 on Monday for the second consecutive day
 jewalers kii badi hui kharidari ke bich majboot vaishvik rukh ke anuroop dilli ke sarrapha bazaar main somvaar ko sone kii keemat 90 rupee kii teji ke saath 25,490 rupee prati 10 gram ho gai
 Apart from this, falling gold exchange rate against American currency has also strengthened gold prices
 audyogic ikaayiyon or sikaa nirmaataaon kii ore se kharid badhane se chaandi bhi 150 rupee tej ho kar 34,200 rupee prati kilogram par pahunch gayi
 Gold prices in Singapore market also 0 in the Singapore market giving direction to domestic market prices
 5 fisadi kii teji ke saath 1,104
 $ 66 per ounce and the price of silver is 0
 2 fisadi kii teji ke saath 14
 70 dollars an ounce
 mekking chargees main ijaphe kii taiyaarisone kii keemton main giravatke baavjood jewelery kii kharidari utani phydemand nahin rahegi
 There is a general opinion in the jewelery market in Delhi that the continued fall in prices over the past few days has reduced their profit margins
 lihaaja vah jewelery kii keemat main jude mekking chargees par discount dene se kataraa rahe hai
 According to Rahul Gupta of PP Jewelers of Delhi, if the decline in gold continues like this, soon he will have to make a big increase in making charges
 kaise kam hui jewalers kii kamaisone se jewelery banaakar bechney main agar jeweler kaa profit margin 10 fisadi maan liya jaae to sone ke 29,000 hajaar rupee ke rate par vah 2900 rupee prati 10 gram kii kamai karata he
 If the gold rate fell to 27,000 level, the margin of Tojwiler would be reduced by 10 grams to Rs 2700
 vahiin maujuuda 25,000 ke rate par yah margin ghatakar maatr 2,500 rupee rahegaa
 In view of this decline, most jewelers including Rahul Gupta believe that even if they increase their stock by buying gold at new rates, there is no reduction in labor and other input costs in making jewelery
 lihaaja, unhen apana margin ricover karne ke liye mekking charge main ijapha karne ke alaava koi doosraa vikalp nahin he
 How much is made in your jewelery? Making charge is usually 10 to 20 percent of the cost of jewelery or labor charge is taken
 haalanki kuch bade or branded jewelery showrooms digining or vailu adishan ke naam par 40 fisadi tak bhi mekking charge lete hai or apni cells ko badhaane ke liye aksar is mekking charge par discount ofer dete hai
 Apart from this, most jewelers also charge extra money from the consumer in the name of hallmarking

 Former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister and Samajwadi Party (SP) President Mulayam Singh Yadav on Thursday appeared deeply concerned about the intermittent firing from the Pakistan side
 purv raksha mantri mulaayam ne kaha ki vah pakistan ke saath yudgh ke khilaaf hai
 At the same time, remembering the martyrs, he said that the country has the most powerful army in the world

 SP state president Shivpal Yadav was also present on the occasion

 Because of them we are safe today
 " Greeting Akhilesh's rath yatra, Mulayam said, 'good thing the rath yatra is coming out
 main is rathyatra ko shubhakamanaayen detaa hum
 But, i also want to say that this rath yatra has been renamed
 iskaa naam 'vikaas se vijay kii ore' hone kii jagah 'vijay se vikaas kii ore' hona chahie tha
 Should have put the word Vijay first
 ' lakhanu sthit lau martenior ground se mulaayam ne vikaas se vijay kii ore rathyatra ko ravaanaa kiya

 If you want to win elections and form a government, you have to work hard

 Virat Kohli is known as a clever captain on the field who always lead Team India during batting and fielding
 captain kohli kii aakraamakata team main saathi khilaadiyon ke liye prerana kaa sabase bada strot rahaa he, kyonki unhone apni captaini main cricketrs ke liye nae maapdand sthapit kar die hai, jisase unhen aage badhate rahane ke liye prerana mili
 But Kohli took such wrong decisions on the field 4 times under his captaincy, which led Team India to face defeat in the Test match
 1
 India vs Australia, Pune 2017 At the beginning of 2017, when the Australian team led by Steve Smith visited India, the first Test match of the series was played at MCA Stadium in Pune, with the pitch being a Sesquire turn on the first day
 is match main captain kohli toss haar gaye
 Under such circumstances, Kohli surprisingly opted to feed Jayant Yadav as the third spinner at the expense of batsman Karun Nair, a clear choice at No
 6
 saamaanya taur par timen aisi rank turnar wicket par ek atirikt ballebaaj ke saath khelti hai
 But Kohli's decision overshadowed Team India and India lost the match by 333 runs
 kohli ke atirikt ballebaaj nahin khilaane kaa faisla bharat ko kaaphi had tak mahangaa padaa tha, kyonki mejabaan team india do pariyon main 105 or 107 ranon par olout ho gai thi
 Jayant took only two wickets in this Test match
 2 
 India vs South Africa, Cape Town 2018 Team India, who visited South Africa in the beginning of 2018, suffered a loss in the first Test match of the series
 capatoun main khele gaye is test match main kohli ne rohit sharma ko ajinkya rahane par tarjeeh di
 For Team India, the decision to include Rohit Sharma in place of Ajinkya Rahane, who batted at No
 5 as vice-captain in Test matches, cost the team dearly
 rohit sharma is match main balle se buree tarah vifal rahe, unhone do pariyon main 10 or 11 ran banaae
 India lost this Test match against South Africa by 72 runs
 3
 India vs England, Edgbaston 2018 The same incident was repeated again on the current England tour
 simit overon kii form ke aadhaar par captain kohli ne england ke khilaaf edbeston main khele gaye pehle test match main lokesh rahul cotest specialist cheteshwar pujarapar tarjeeh di
 Rahul scored 4 and 13 runs in this match
 nateeja team india yah match 31 ranon se ganvaa baithi
 Team India suffered the loss of Pujara's drop
 number teen par bhartiya team ke liye kaaphi ahm bhoomika nibhaane vaale pujaara ne test cricket main ab tak 59 maichon kii 99 pariyon main 49
 He has scored 4549 runs at an average of 45 and his highest score is 206 runs
 4
 India vs England, Lords 2018 On the current England tour, Team India played the second Test at Lord's against hosts England
 test kaa pehla din puri tarah se barish main dhul gaya tha, jisaki vajah se toss main deree hui thi
 But at the time of the pitch report, all the former cricketers had said that it would be good if they also land with a spinner on this pitch
 pich tej gendbaajon ke mutabik thi, iske baavjood umesh yadav jaise gendbaaj ko nahin khilaayaa gaya
 In the overcast conditions, Indian captain Virat Kohli gave the chance to the chinaman Kuldeep Yadav in place of fast bowler Umesh Yadav
 bhartiya team ne yah match pari or 159 ranon se ganvaa diya
 The Indian team went into the match with Kuldeep Yadav as the extra spin bowler, while the situation was according to the fast bowlers and it seemed that the third bowler would help the team
 barish ke kaaran bhartiya team management kaa yah daanv ulataa pad gaya
 When the daughter of farmer Gajendra Singhki, who committed suicide during an AAP rally in Delhi, spoke to Aaj Tak, AAP leader Ashutosh wept bitterly

 Ashutosh said emotionally, "megha, you are my daughter, i am your culprit
" main use nahin bachaa paaya
 Soon after, Megha said, 'I want to say that these partisan parties should not do politics
 congress bijepi par or bijepi AAP ko is tarah doshi na tehraaen
 'it is noteworthy that during the AAP rally at Jantar Mantar in Delhi, farmer Gajendra Singh of Dausa district of Rajasthan committed suicide

 ek adhyayan kii maane to physical work se ji churaane vaale log, tulanaatmak rup se zyada samajhadaar or budhimaan hote hai
 In such a situation, if people used to give taunts of doom till now, then now you can tell them that intelligent people reduce physical work

 Now whenever someone tells you that you are lazy or doodle, immediately tell them that you are lazy because you are intelligent
 ek research ke mutabik, jo log aalsee hote hai yaa shaareerik taur par kam kaam karte hai, asal main unka dimag tej hota he
 According to the study, people who think for longer time are able to reduce physical work
 ek survey ke anusaar, tej dimag vaale log physicli bahut active nahin hote hai
 Despite this, they are not bored because they keep thinking something all the time
 unke lieunke vichaar or unki soch bahut myne rakhti haior ve unheen main biji rahete hai
 Research has found that physically overworked people are "non-thinkers" and do not pay attention to their thoughts
 "jarnal of health psychology" main prakashit is adhyayan ke anusaar, sampurna vikaas ke liye sochna or shaareerik kaam karnaa dono hi jaruri hai
 However, people who are physically overworked quickly become bored, which also affects their brain
 adhyayan main gaur karne vaali ek baat or kahi gai he kijo log zyada budhimaan hai lekin kaam se ji churaate hai,ve bhi ek samay ke baad bor hone lagate hai or unamem bhi negativity aane lagati he
 In such a situation, if you develop a habit of working with thinking, then lifestyle can be improved

 skool main jab group song kii practice chal rahi thi tab shakira bhi group ke saath sur mila rahi thim
 Then Shashiraki came to the music teacher Shakira and said that you are not fit to sing in Tum Group, because your voice is like goat
 shakira ne kaha ki, 'jab meri teacher ne aisa kaha to main bahut niraash ho gayi
 But perhaps she was right in her place because my voice in the teenage sounded like a little goat

 What success will a government led by Narendra Modi in preparation for celebrating the first anniversary with a few jumlets like 'one Year, Desh Ke Naam'? Or will the population associated with the business of land (agriculture) be angry? After the Supreme Court quashed the decision to grant reservation in the list of Other Backward Classes (obcs) to Jats, the agitation with which the Central Government met the Jat delegation and filed a reconsideration petition, now all OBC organizations Having mobilized and opened a front against the government, on the other hand, the Jat community has also declared a fight for reservation
 supreme court ne beete 17 march ko apane faisle main jaaton ko centre sarkaar kii obisi suchi main shaamil karne vaali adhisuchana ko radd kar diya tha
 The court had clearly stated that Jats are not socially and educationally backward as their number in the armed forces, government jobs and educational institutions is wrong
 jaaton ne adaalat ke faisle par kadaa aitraaj jataate hue dharna-pradarshan kiya tha
 After this, on March 26, a 70-member Jat delegation met Prime Minister Narendra Modi, where the assurance of filing a review petition was given
 lekin sarkaar kii is pahal ko obisi ne apane hiton par aghat qaraar dete hue jat aarakshan ke khilaaf modi sarkaar par hallaa bol kii taiyaari kar lee he
 Why are the backward people with 52 percent of the population getting 27 percent reservation under the recommendations of the Atmospheric Commission, but the inclusion of Jats in it is considered as backward class encroachment
 jabaki pichley ek saal main aarakshan kii vajah se mili phaayde ko dekhte hue jat samudaay ise kisi bhi haalat main chhodia nahin chahta
 The OBC has mobilized all the organizations by creating a backward class co-ordination committee and has chalked out a strategy to stage a sit-in protest at Delhi's Jantar Mantar on May 7, just before the budget session of Parliament is over
 obisi ke is andolan kii aguai kar rahe haryana ke kurukshetra se bijepi saansad rajkumaar saini kehete hai "jat shaikshanik, saamaajik, aarthik, rajnatik, prashasnic taur par pichde nahin hai
 No commission recommended putting them in this category
 phir bhi jat obisi ke 27 fisadi aarakshan main asanvaidhanik tareeke se ghusane ke liye lalayit hai
 We have asked for an appointment with the Prime Minister
 "unke mutabik, 75 khaapon ke maseehaa banane vaale pratinidhiyon ne yahaan tak kah diya ki koun hota he supreme court aarakshan rokane vaala? in logon ne dhamkee di ki 11 may ko dilli kaa pani, doodh roak denge or aarpaar kii ladaai ladenge
 However, Jat leader and former Union Minister Ajit Singh tells India Today, "the Jat community got a lot of reservation in a year and many students got admission in institutes like IIT and got a job also, so the reservation was taken away
 Angry " samast bharat khap or jat aarakshan sangharsh samiti ne 11 may ko jantar mantar par chetavanee raily kaa elaan kiya he
 Ajit Singh believes that the Jats have now become aware and are therefore demanding their rights
 lekin obisi ke virodh ko ve yah kehete hue jaij tehraate hai ki baahar se aane waalon kaa virodh to hota hi he
 While Union Minister of State for Agriculture Sanjeev Balian says, "jats will get reservation, but what will be the path is yet to be decided
" philhal sarkaar ne court main punarvichaar yachika daakhil kar di he
 The reservation should have been received in advance, but got delayed and was snatched very quickly
 " kuch jat netaaon kaa kahana he ki agar court kaa faisla jaaton ke hit main nahin aayaa, to dilli-ensiaar ke chaaron ore based jat doodh-pani kii aapurti thap karne jaisaa kadam uthaa sakate hai
 What is the government-bjp strategy? Encouraged by the overwhelming support from Jats in the Lok Sabha elections, the Modi government had justified the previous government's decision in an affidavit filed in the Supreme Court
 lekin court ne sarkaar kii adhisuchana ko radd kar uski mushkilen badha di he
 In the meeting with Jat representatives, Prime Minister Modi had given the assurance of reservation within the scope of the Constitution, then BJP President Amit Shah had ruled it wrong to keep this farming caste out of reservation
 ab sarkaar ne is maamle main punarvichaar yachika daali he jisamen kaha gaya he ki rashtriya pichhadaa varg ayog kii sifarish sarkaar ke faisle main anivaary nahin he or lambey vichaar-vimarsh va dastavejon ke aadhaar par hi jaaton ko obisi kii suchi main shaamil karne kaa faisla liya gaya tha
 But the government will ask the Jat community to be patient till the decision of the court
 bijepi kii badi chunauti obisi ke virodh se he
 Disappointed with regional parties, a large section of the obcs voted for the BJP in the Lok Sabha elections, whose displeasure may be damaging to the party
 party kii mushkil yah he ki virodh main party kaa obisi dhada hi saamne aata dikh rahaa he, jise anushaasanamak karrwai kii parvaah nahin he
 If the court gives a verdict against the Jats, the government may be in double trouble
 anya vipakshi dalon ke jat netaaon ne to sidhe modi sarkaar ko kathghare main khadaa karnaa shuru kar diya he
 Ajit Singh says that in the reconsideration petition, the government has not properly advocated
 sawaal uthaanaa chahie tha ki 1934 ke survey par 1993 main mandal kamishan ke tahat aarakshan mil saktaa he to 10 saal puraane tathyon-aankadon par jaaton ko kyon nahin
 Ajit Singh, who was part of the cabinet of the UPA government at the time of the Jat reservation decision, said that the Backward Classes Commission did not go to the survey on the ground
 ve supreme court par bhi sawaal uthaate hai
 He says, "there is Jat reservation in state jobs, but not in the center
 kisi anya jati ke saath aisa nahin he
 "but in view of the situation of community conflict about this, Haryana BJP President Subhash Barala makes very cautious remarks
 ve kehete hai, "bijepi jaat-paant kii raajnneeti nahin karti
 If any community is poor, it should get reservation and from the same point of view, the Central Government has filed a petition
 " haalanki bijepi saansad saini kii morchebandi par unka kahana he ki koi agar apane varg kii baat karata he to usamen kuch bura nahin he
 High on the recommendations, the Supreme Court has justified the recommendation of the National Backward Classes Commission against the Jat reservation, saying that there is no doubt that the Commission has reported the State Backward Classes Commissions, the available literature and the Expert Committee of the Indian Council of Social Science Research Was recommended based on the report
 lekin centre ne apni shakti kaa istemaal kar use khaarij kiya
 While doing so, there should have been a reasonable basis for rejecting the recommendation of the Commission, which is not visible
 parishad ne jo adhyayan kiya, uske mutabik bihar main koi survey nahin hua, jabaki dilli main ahir-gurjar ke mukaable jat saamaajik, shaikshanik taur se thodaa peeche hai
 There is no document in Gujarat, there is no comparative data in Himachal, Madhya Pradesh
