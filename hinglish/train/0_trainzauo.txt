 The left-handed Sangakkara has always been identified as a bashful cricketer, but his performance has always been that of a thundering cricketer from the Sri Lankan side in the field over the last 15 years
 ve bhale behad shant najar aate hon, lekin wicketcaping ho yaa ballebaazi yaa phir apni captaini, ve vipakshi kheme main halchal machaate rahe
 On the other hand, the cricketing career of Australian captain Michael Clarke started in 2004, but he emerged as a cricketer of very gentle nature in the Australian team, known for playing aggressive cricket
 unke chehre par duusare australian cricketron kii tarah shaatiranaa bhav nahin dikhataa
 His face looked bright with pride and self-confidence, and when it came to batting, he also kept the boundaries out of those angles, which would be difficult to think about many times
 captain ke taur par bhi ve utaar-chadhaav ke daur se guzarati australian team ko naa keval sanbhaalane main kaamyaab rahe, balki oonchai tak le jane main safal rahe
 If the backache had not exacerbated Michael Clarke's physical problems, his test career would have been long, but he would be remembered for a long time due to his temperament and batting
 donon kii vidaai ek din jarur ho rahi he, lekin halaat ekadam alag hai
 While Kumar Sangakkara had announced his departure before the Test series, on the other hand Clarke announced his retirement during the series due to a crushing defeat in the Ashes series from England and his own poor batting
 ye bhi cricket ke romaanch main hi shaamil he
 However, it is to be hoped that these two geniuses of cricket will leave their last Test memorable

 di company ke andar daraar padane kii khabar ke bich anderworld don daaud ibrahim ke saathi chota shakeel ne isse inkaar kiya he
 Chhota Shakeel, calling this news wrong, told Aaj Tak that d Company has only one supremo and it is Dawood Ibrahim
 daaud ke alaava koi bhi bos bana to ham use nahin maanenge
 According to reports, Chhota Shakeel was angry with Anees Ibrahim over his preference in the functioning of the company and hence d has split from the company
 haalanki ajtak se baatcheet main chota shakeel ne daaud ibrahim se alag hone kii khabar ko galat bataaya he
 He said that he is still with Dawood
 chota shakeel se Exclusive baatcheetsawaal-daaud ibrahim or aapke bich daraar kii khabaren aa rahi hai?chota shakeel-hamaare bich koi daraar nahin he
 In d Company all do their own work
 koi kisi ke kaam main dakhal andaaji nahin karata
 All consult each other
 di company kaa ek hi supremeo daaud ibrahim he
 Question - a simple question that needs a straight answer
 yadi daaud kii jagah anis ko jimmedaari di gai to kya chota shakeel kaam karegaa?chota shakeel-aap log itnaa lanbaa sochate hi kyon ho? 35 saal se company main shakeel kaa kya role he? aap sabko maaloom he
 i don't need to tell you what i do in the company
 bhai ke alaava koi chif bana to ham nahin maanenge
 Shakeel knows that d Company's secret question is justified, can the old belief of Dawood and Chhota Shakeel be broken so easily? Probably not
 kyonki daaud ke liye chota shakeel se yaa chota shakeel ke liye daaud se dushmani mol lenaa donon ke liye khatarnaak he
 Dawood Ibrahim and Chhota Shakeel know all the secrets of d Company
 daaud ke baad much saktaa he ghamasandaaud se alag hone kaa anjaam chota shakeel bhi acchhee tarah jaanata he
 That is why Chhota Shakeel said in a phone conversation with Aaj Tak that everyone in d Company has the same boss and he is Dawood Ibrahim
 haalanki, anis ke sawaal par shakeel ne sidhaa jawaab nahin diya
 This means that after Dawood, there may be a fierce situation in the company
 karachi main hi rahata he chota shakilmumbai dhamaakon ke mastermaid daaud ibrahim kii tarah chota shakeel ne bhi pakistan ke karachi main panaah le rakhi thi
 From there, he operated the business of d Company spread in many countries of the world
 daaud ne apane jis bhai anis ibrahim kii vajah se shakeel se dushmani mol lee wo bhi karachi main hi rahata he
 Is this Dawood's new move or not? There are also reports that Shakeel has changed his whereabouts after he told Dawood
 haalanki wo kahaan gaya isaki koi khabar nahin he
 Experts also believe that for the last few days, Indian intelligence agencies have stepped up efforts to catch Dawood, then it may be that Dawood has done this trick to divert the direction of this attempt

 Kamaljit Sehrawat, president of Mahila Morcha, the leader of AAP, who is involved in anti-women activities, said that the party claims the safety of women, but one MLA after another has been found to be involved in anti-women activities

 upi ke purv mukhyamantri mulaayam singh yadav ne raashtrapati chunaav par bijepi kaa samarthan kiya he
 Mulayam Singh said that BJP has given a good candidate for a Presidential post
 mulaayam ne bataaya ki ramnath kovind se mere puraane sambandh hai
 Apart from praising Kovind, Mulayam Singh also said his chances of becoming President were strong
 mulaayam ne kaha ki bijepi ke paas bahumat he
 If one or two percent is required, BJP will manage
 vipaksh ke sawaal par mulaayam singh jawaab dene se bachate najar aae
 Mulayam said that he cannot say what the opposition will decide
 bataa den ki 2019 ke aam chunaav se pehle raashtrapati chunaav ko vipakshi dal ekajutata kaa bada mauka maan rahe the
 This is the reason that for the last two months, a political meeting was going on with the opposition to try to field a common candidate
 raashtrapati chunaav ko vipaksh kii ore se 2019 main mahagathbandhan banane kii pehali pariksha maani ja rahi thi
 But what did BJP announce on Ramnath Kovind's candidacy on Monday, before the opposition united, the opposition began to disintegrate
 modi ke is masterstroke se na keval rashtriya mahagathbandhan kii sambhaavna balki bihar main maujuuda mahagathbandhan main daraar pad sakati he
 Opposition parties have called a meeting on 22 June to discuss a common candidate for the presidential election
 usase pehle hi kai gaiyr endie dalon ne ramnath kovind ko samarthan dene kaa elaan kar diya
 After TRS, AIADMK, BJP, Nitish is also in the mood to support Ramnath Kovind
 ramnath kovind bihar ke rajyapal hai or nitish ke saath unke behatar rishte rahe hai
 Nitish welcomed the candidature of Ramnath Kovind
 sutron ke mutabik nitish kumaar ne argedy chif lalu prasad or congress chif sonia gandhi se is maamle par baat bhi kii he or ramnath kovind ke naam par virodh karne main apni asamarthta jataai he
 However, the party has not officially clarified its stand regarding this
 sutron ke anusaar nitish kumaar ne buudhvaar ko party netaaon kii baithak bulaai he
 After this, an official announcement of support can be made
 endie ke paksh main kaise he samikarankovind ke naam ke elaan kaa ekatarfa faisla agar bijepi ne kiya he to uske peeche vartmaan samikarnon kaa sidhaa haath he
 If you look at the Electoral College for the presidential election, 57
 85% sameekaran sattadhari endie ke paksh main dikh rahe hai
 In such a situation, even if the opposition field their candidate, the chances of victory are slim
 kya he number gemerashtrapati chunaav ke liye agarelectoral college main endieke paksh main he 5,37,683 jo ki kul kaa 48
 It makes up 93%
 lekin tiares, ediemke, wiesar congress ne endie ummidavaar ko samarthan dene kaa elaan kiya he to ab endie ke paksh main kul 57
 85% of the vote takes place
 bijedy bhi endie ke paksh menodisha ke siem or bijedy chif naveen patnayak ne somvaar shaam ramnath kovind kii ummidavaari ke samarthan kaa elaan kiya
 This leaves 2 in favor of NDA
 99% kii or vruddhi ho gai
 Although there are speculations on the discussion on several names, including Meira Kumar, by the opposition, it may be difficult for the two UP parties BSP and SP to oppose Kovind
 kyonki ramnath kovind dalit samudaay se aate hai
 His candidature for the BJP could prove to be a masterstroke
 upi ke dalon ke liye virodh mushkilspa or basapa kii ore se kovind kii ummidavaari par thos virodh saamne nahin aayaa he
 No party would want to be seen opposing the Dalit candidate before the 2019 elections
 vahiin jediu adhyaksh or bihar ke siem nitish kumaar kaa rukh bhi kovind kii ummidavaari par naram dikh rahaa he
 Ramnath Kovind is currently the Governor of Bihar and has had a good rapport with Nitish Kumar
 nitish kumaar ne kovind kii ummidavaari kaa swaagat kiya he haalanki, samarthan ke maamle par vipaksh kii baithak ke baad faisle kii baat bhi kahi he
 These 4 names discussed by the opposition, the opposition can field a joint candidate against NDA candidate Ramnath Kovind in the presidential election
 vam dalon main sutron ne somvaar kii raat yah baat kahi
 non-nda parties are expected to meet on 22 June to discuss the issue
 sutron ke anusaar purv loksabhaa adhyaksh mira kumaar,purv kendriya mantri susheel kumaar scindia, bharipa bahujan mahasanghake netaa or dow
 Opposition parties are considering Prakash Yashwant Ambedkar, grandson of BR Ambedkar, grandson of Mahatma Gandhi and retired bureaucrat Gopalakrishna Gandhi and some other names

 Why is the crowd doubling today? '(PHOTO: Local MP Jayant Sinha, who was on the pm's platform at the rally, shared this photo on his Twitter account) Modi said,' i have come to Jharkhand many times, but this time i will ask you something i have not come to ask main aapkaa naman karne aayaa hum, aapako dhanyavad dene aayaa hum

 PM Modi said that Jharkhand is not a minor state
 yah hindustan ke duusare rajyon se bahut aage jane kii takat rakhata he
 If Jharkhand is well, then other states will also benefit
 yahaan se log palaayan ko majaboor hai
 If there will be development then why people will move to other states
 yahaan kaa koyala nikalegaa to 20 hajaar karod rupee centre se milenge

 They robbed people as much as they had to
 desh main saare prayog ho chuke hai
 Now all experiments have to be abandoned
 desh main ab vikaas kii raajnneeti kerani hogi
 If we choose the government, then by making development the basis jati, birdari par raajnneeti nahin hone denge
 If you want to get married then it is understandable about the fraternity, but where does the fraternity come in handy for employment
 vikaas hoga tabhi rojgaar milegaa, birdari kii raajnneeti se kya hoga
 i am born in poverty, so i see my connection with the poor
 'pradhanmantri ne vaada kiya ki jharkhand kii sarkaar yahaan kii janata ke liye to kaam karegi hi, dilli kii sarkaar (centre sarkaar) bhi inke liye kaam karegi
 Modi appealed to the people to vote fiercely and said that if the state has to be brought on the path of development, then the BJP government will have to be formed

 ) The freed Harjit Christ from the terrorist organization ISKI has returned to India
 harjit ke parivaar ne bataaya ki iraq main kuch maheene rahane ke baad wo swadesh sahi salaamat waapas aa gaye hai
 Harjeet was among the 40 Indians who were abducted by IS in June last year
 angraji akhbaar 'da indian express' kii khabar ke mutabik, harjit ke bade bhai robin messiah ne kaha ki harjit iraq se haal hi main bharat laut aayaa he
 Harjeet reached Delhi and talked to us on the phone but he did not tell us his exact location
 robin ne kaha ki harjit ne jald hi ghar lautne ke liye kaha he
 Harjeet's family lives in Kala Afghana village near Gurdaspur district in Punjab
 harjit kaa iraq ke mosul se pichley saal 11 june ko apharan ho gaya tha
 However, after four days in IS captivity, Harjit managed to get out of captivity
 lekin kaid se reeha hone ke bah harjit kii sahi lokation ke bare main sahi se pataa nahin chal paaya he
 In November, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj said in Parliament that Harjeet was under the protection of the government
 harjit ke bhai robin ne bataaya ki ham beetein kai maheenon se use khojane ke liye koshish kar rahe the, lekin harjit ke phone karne tak hamen koi jaankaree nahin mil pai thi
 Robin said that Harjeet called from an internet number
 ham us number kii madad se use dhudhane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 But we have not had any success in this so far
 yaad rahe ki jin 39 bharatiyon ko aies kii kaid main maare jane kii ashanka jataai ja rahi thi, unamem harjit hi akele aise shaks the, jinke jinda hone or sari sachai jaanane vaale sutara ke taur par dekha ja rahaa tha
 In such a situation, on Harjit's return to India, it can be expected that he can find out some secrets of IS

 This session was called to discuss the 16 points set by India and the United Nations of Mahatma Gandhi's dreams, although this discussion became less and more an arena for showing political power
 shuru main vipaksh ne lagaataar chalane vaale is 36 ghante ke satr ke liye sahmati di thi, lekin aakhri vakt main sarkaar ko iskaa siyaasi phayda na mil jaae ise dekhte hue iskaa bahishkaar karne kaa faisla kar liya
 The Yogi government also took this boycott as a challenge and made them realize their strength by breaking many big names of the opposition
 vipaksh kaa bahishkarvipaksh kaa bahishkaar tuutata dekh 24 ghante baad samaajawaadee party ne sadan ke baahar is satr kaa virodh karnaa shuru kiya or gandhi va godse kii baat 24 ghante ke baad sadan parisar main shuru ho gai
 At the beginning of the session, the Yogi government had hoped that the opposition would come to the House in the name of Mahatma Gandhi, but when the opposition boycotted the unity, the government also started its bets
 sadan ke bahaane len-dein kaa khelsbase pehle congress kii taraf se aditi singh pahunchi
 The same Aditi Singh who is a Rae Bareli MLA
 gandhi parivaar or sonia gandhi kii kareebi hai
 However, on Wednesday night, Aditi Singh came on the opposition bench and supported the government's decision from there

 Soon after Aditya Singh, sp-backed Nitin Aggarwal made his speech in favor of the government by ending the fear card of the Navy House

 Aditi Singh also met Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath late in the night and the government also provided security of y-plus category to him as the session went on
 saaf he sadan ke bahaane daanv-pech, shah-maat or len-dein kaa khel saaf dikhaai de rahaa he
 Aditya Singh, on the first day praising the decision of the government, patted a match for the government on behalf of the opposition, and the next day Shivpal Yadav took the front on Thursday

 Shivpal Yadav's first two BSP mlas, Aslam Ragini and Brijesh Singh, also walked out of the party line and spoke out in this special session and praised the government
 saaf he ki is vishesh satr main vipaksh ke bahishkaar ko sarkaar ne apana presties yishu bana liya tha
 Yogi Adityanath gave a 2-hour speech, which was the longest speech given by the Leader of the House in any House till the start of the Latadis special on the opposition's walk out

 Opposition did not desist from doing politics: Yogi Yogi said, 'we also spoke with opposition party leaders for the special session
 kya hua he, kya hona he
 Everyone will discuss it together

 At the same time, the opposition did not desist from doing politics on this, it is not that if the cock does not bud, there will be no morning

 We distance ourselves from the discussion on poverty, for example, the House has been running for 24 hours, but the opposition is absent
 'yogi sarkaar ne dikhaai taakatyogi adityanath ko vipaksh kii gaiyr-maujuudagi khub khali he
 Perhaps this is the reason why he too was determined that if the opposition does not come to the house then he will break the opposition and this is what happened when Congress, Samajwadi Party and BSP mlas and members of the Legislative Council in this special session aces dukde Arrived
 bhale hi unki taadaad 2-2 kii rahi ho lekin isi bahaane partiyon ke bheetar machi kalah saamne aa gai or sarkaar ne bhi apni takat dikhaa di
 There was a lot of discussion on Gandhi's name but the discussion was lost in the political stance of the opposition and the opposition
 puri charchaa is par simat gai ki shah or maat ke khel main koun paksh, koun se daanv chal rahaa he

 But the press release issued after this conference says something else
 mayawati kii ore se jari relies main kaha gaya he ki bispi kaa cader ab kisi upachunaav main kisi bhi dal kaa samarthan nahin karegaa
 With this, speculation rounds have started regarding the alliance between SP and BSP
 haalanki, is kayaason ke bichamayawatine somvaar ko media se kaha ki aane vaale upachunaav main hamaara cader bijepi ko haraane ke liye kaam karegaa
 Let me tell you that byelections are to be held in the Lok Sabha seat of Kairana in UP and the Assembly seat of Noorpur
 mayawati ke bayaan ke baad aise kayaas hai ki in donon seat par bispi sapa kaa saport nahin karegi

 What is the poster of this thing? Why have so many people come here? ' This question was posed by the woman, whose 'mission Rainbow' poster was placed on the wall just in front of the door
 uske ek sawaal ne is mishan se juden tamaam sthaneey adhikariyon or sahyogiyon par sawaal khadey kar die the
 Actually, all the posters were placed just before the media team arrived

 What is 'mission Indradhanush', Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India launched 'mission Indradhanush' on 25 December 2014

 UNICEF is working as a great team
 isse jude log ek vijan ke saath apane lakshya ko hasil karne kii koshish kar rahe hai
 It is very important that the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, one of the world's largest immunization programs, has set up a large system to closely monitor the program, but the media team visited the Muchiyadih in Dhanbad's Baghmara block
 It is difficult to guess whether any effective monitoring mechanism is working or not

 lekin is sawaal par bhi urjit patel ne koi saaf jawaab nahin diya

 raashtragit vande maataram ko lekar alpsankhyakon ne is conference main ek prastaav paarit kiya
 In 2006, a fatwa was issued from Darul Uloom that Muslims should not read the national anthem Vande Mataram, because Islam only talks about the worship of God, whereas the song Vande Mataram refers to the worship of Vatan and hence this song is considered against the principle of Islam

 The match also started 15 minutes late due to poor lighting and light drizzle

 The conditions were not favorable for the game in the morning, but later the pitch started to suit the batsmen
 hawa band ho gayi, badal chant gaye or gendbaajon ko swing milani band ho gai
 Various news about the leakage of Aadhaar data has been part of the media till now, but the allegation of Aadhaar data leaking in the Delhi High Court has been misleading by the Unique Identification Authority of India, ie UIDAI, which stores the data

 yachikakarta kii is yachika main data li hone kaa aarope ashanka ke aadhaar par he or uskaa koi pramanik sorce nahin he
 The court sought a response from the central government and UIDIA on August 21 last year in this case

 In such a situation, it becomes the responsibility of both that the personal information of the people is protected but it did not happen

 'chandani aaj bhale hi hamaare bich nahin hai lekin lalita ayyar kii pustak rup kii rani, shridevi ko ek baar phir se hindi hartland main jivit kar detii he
 Lalita has written this book in English under the name 'sridevi: Queen of Hearts', which has been translated into Hindi by Anu Singh Chaudhary
 bollywood kii sarvaadhik saphaltam heroinon main se ek ke jivan se jude rochak kisse, ghatnaayen is pustak main is kadar darj hai ki unhen padhane ke dauraan kai baar aisa prathit hota he ki shridevi apni badi-badi ankhon se aapako dekh raheen hai
 Through this book, Lalita Iyer has told about the untouched aspects of Sridevi's life, which the reader of Hindi was unaware of, and has also kept it very comfortable that how Sridevi's acting has made her repeatedly He kept connecting with his mother
 aap jab yah pustak padhenge to aapako yah pataa chalegaa hi kaise apratim saundarya kii devi, dance kii mallika, shandaar kamedian or adaakara shridevi ne purushpradhan bollywood or box ofis par pehali superstar nayika hone kaa tamgaa hasil kiya
 Not only did Sridevi become the heroine of the film at the tender age of 11, but how did she lose her childishness and agility as she started acting at the age of 4
 haalanki samooche jivan unke chehre se maasoomiyat kabhi hati nahin
 In the shock, innocence like a 6-year-old girl, a comedy like Charlie Chaplin in Mr
 India, and Sridevi ruled the hearts of crores of people with their savory acts in the moonlight
 paanch bhashaaon kii saikadon filmon main kaam karne vaali shri devi ke liye ye sab kuch itnaa aasaan nahin tha
 
 
 That too when Sridevi was not fluent in any language and that is why she attached herself to her character in her comeback film 'english-vinglish' so much that her acting became immortal
 shridevi filmon main ain or behtareen kaam bhi kiya, par yah unki chwis nahin thi
 Where does she become her choice at that age, when she got down in acting? And even if it is made, who understands it
 shri ne filmein sirf apane mata-pita kii khushi ke liye sweekaara
 The truth is, what would a little girl know about acting, she was just fulfilling her mother's unfulfilled ambitions
 isko lekar lekhika ne ek kisse kaa varnan karte hue likhaa he -camere ke saamne pehali baar aane ke bare main shridevi ne khalid mohammad ko bataaya :'haa, wo din meri yaad main abhi tak tazaa he
 i was hidden behind the pallu of my mother's sari
 lekin maa ne kaha, "pappi darane kii koi baat nahin he
 "I believed the mother's word and just started from there
 mujhe uske baad koi chuttee nahin mili
 It is commonly said that child actors, especially child stars, have to go through very difficult times
 mere saath aisa kuch bhi nahin hua
 But i remember that there was a child who was acting with me
 hamen ek seen main ronaa tha or main baat-baat par ro padati thi
 But the second child used to cry only when his mother bites him hard
 maine gyaarah saal kii umr main telegu film anuraglu ke saath heroin ke rup main bhi kaam karnaa shuru kar diya
 i was playing the role of a blind girl and all i had to do was look at the camera with my bare eyes
 main aagyaakaari bacchee thi shaayad
 She used to do what the directors told me to do
 'lekhika ne is tarah shridevi ke bahaane is pustak ke madhyam se cinema jagat main bal-kalakaaron par hone vaale shoshan par bhi prakaash daalane kii koshish kii he
 Those interested in Sridevi's marriage and love affair and the rapport with other actresses will particularly like the section where Mithun Chakraborty, Boney Kapoor, Madhuri Dixit, Hema Malini and Rekha's proximity to Sridevi are mentioned
 is
 lalita ne is pustak ko 15 bhaagon main baanta he, jo shridevi ke jivan ke alag-alag daur ko bayaan karti he
 Lalita Iyer's grip on film themes and language is not new
 filmphere kii managing editor or achti cafe kii dipti editor rah chuki lalita ne 'da hole shibangeh stick bits of beeing a vuman' or 'ai em pregnant, note terminli il, you ediyat' jaisi kitabon se khaasi charchaa hasil kar rakhi he
 Anu Singh Chaudhary should be praised for the fact that he has translated this book into a very simple language for Hindi readers
 154 prishthon kii is kitaab main shridevi ne kabhi hansaaya he, kabhi rulaayaa he
 
 
 Obviously this book by Lalitha Iyer will remind you of every form of Sridevi
 agar aapako filmon main ruchi he, or aap rup kii rani shridevi ke jivan or jivan sangharshow ke rahabar hona chaahate hai to yah kitaab aapke padhane laayak he
 There are many such things in the book that you will be surprised to know that i did not know this
 
 
 vaaki yah pustak jitani shridevi ke banane, unki jaddojehad or sangharshon kii kahani he, utani hi ek stri or ek nayika ke rup main shridevi ko di gai shradhanjali bhi he! xxrep 4 * pustakarup kii rani shridevilekhikaclalita ayyanuwadanu singh choudharividhathjivani upanyasprakashakyaeka, westland buxmoolyah250 / rupyeprishth sankhyah154 The 10-day pilgrimage to the holy pilgrimage Srikhand Mahadev located in Kullu district of Himachal Pradesh began on Friday

 upayukta hansraj chouhan ne ieenes se kaha ki kisi bhi tirthayatri ko chikitsa pareekshan ke bina 17,600 foot kii oonchai par chadhaai kii anumati nahin hogi
 This is the first time that four rescuers and a medical team have been deployed along with pilgrims for this 30-km journey to cope with the extreme conditions
 suraksha ke taur par tirthayatriyon ko is yatra ko shuru karne se pehle har prakaar kii jaankaree police ke samaksh darj karana jaruri he
 Last year, six pilgrims died during this pilgrimage
 tirthayatriyon ne shimla se 150 kilometre dur jaaon se yatra shuru kar di he or iskaa samaapan shrikhand mahadev kii chotii par hoga, jahaan ve 72 foot lambey shivlinga ke darshan karenge

 PM said - Children are the biggest ambassadors of cleanliness
 jo baat bacchon ke gale utar gai he vah hamen samaj kyon nahin aati
 The PM sarcastically said that when he asks to wash his hands, he says there is no water
 piem modi ko gaali dene ke hajaar vishay hai, main har din kuch na kuch detaa hum, to dete rahen, lekin apana daayitv nibhaaen
 The comments piem modi ne kaha ki aaj se chaar paanch saal pehle tivi par kai story banati thi ki skool main bacchon se safai karavaate hai
 Today there has been a change that if any school children are participating in the cleanliness campaign, then the main news of TV becomes
 unhone kaha ki swatchta kaa aankada teji se sudhara he
 According to that the pace is fine, but until you see the subject of cleanliness from a woman's perspective, we will not understand it
 ek ghar main sabko kooda-karkat failaane kaa adhikaar he, lekin ek maa usko saaf karti rahati he
 Understand that woman's pain and do not spread dirt

 Lighted and desirous of going to the toilet, she waits until nightfall

 He said that the cleanliness figure has steadily improved

 Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi on Sunday declared the jdu's separation from the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) as a betrayal of the voters of Bihar on Tuesday to celebrate Betrayal Day and to keep 'bihar off' on that day

 Modi said that by breaking the alliance, JDU has betrayed not only the BJP, but also the people of entire Bihar
 unhone kaha ki asal baat yah he ki aaj ek pichhadaa varg kaa vyakti pradhanmantri kii kursi tak pahunchane vaala he, to kai log ghabara gaye hai
 He appealed to the people to take revenge on such treacherous people in the next Lok Sabha election
 hydrocarbon mahanideshaalay :dijiech: ne somvaar ko kaha ki reliance industries keji di6 kshetra main kuon kii khudaai kii apni patibaddhta puri nahin kar saki he, jisase is kshetra se utpaadan main acchhee khaasi giravat ai he
 Reliance made Dhirubhai in KG-D6 block in Bay of Bengal
 1 or dhirubhai
 Committed to dig 22 wells in 3 areas by April 2011, making 5
 34 karod ghan meter gas pratidin utpaadan ho sake
 The MA oil field of the same block was to produce 80–90 lakh cubic meters of gas
 is tarah se company dwaara kshetra vikaas yojana :epadeepi: main april 2011 tak 6
 Commitment was made for total production of 18
8 million cubic meters of gas per day
 dijiech ke mahanideshak esake shrivastav ne somvaar ko kaha ki iske vipareet company ne di1 or di3 main ab tak 18 utpaadan kuon kii puraa kiya he jinka ekikrut utpaadan lagbhag 4
 20 million cubic meters of gas per day
 company ne do or kuon kii khudaai kii he jinhen utpaadan pranali se nahin joda gaya he
 However, he did not say what action the DGH or the government could take if Reliance failed to live up to the commitment
 petroleum mantri es jaipal reddy ne bhi is aashay ke sawaal kaa jawaab nahin diya

 There is shocking news from Bihar
 khap kii tarj par gopalganj jile ke dogaanvon kii panchayatone ladakiyon ke genes pahanane or mobile phone istemaal karne par roak laga di he
 All this happened in a single week
 bihar main sambhawatah aise ye pehle maamle hai
 The reasoning of the Panchayats behind this decision is that this step has been taken to stop the impact of Western civilization on girls
 ye farmaan ek janvari se lagu hona he
 In the two villages where this decree will be implemented, there is also the president of the National Democratic Party and the father of seven daughters, Laloo Prasad Yadav
 vaise bihar main khap panchayaton jaisi koi vyavastha nahin he
 Like all villages of the country, common panchayats have been here since ancient times
 lalu prasad yadav ne apane gaanv phulvariyaa kii panchayat ke is faisle par par abhi chuppi saadh rakhi he
 Still no response from his side on this matter is a question in itself
 haalanki gaanv kii ladakiyon par is faisle kii nafarmani ke liye koi sazaa mukarrar nahin kii gai he
 Panchayats appealed to parents to keep their girls away from jeans and mobiles
 bihar ke itihaas main mahilaon kaa samaaj main sthaan bahut ooncha he
 In such a situation, these conservative decisions seem strange
 jis pradesh main is tarah kaa koi maamla kabhi saamne na aayaa ho, vahaan ise kya sirf shuruuaat or apwaad ke taur dekha ja saktaa he yaa phir yah ek nae silsile kii shuruyaat he? kyonki panchayatein aksar ek-duusare ke faislon ko apanaati nazar aati hai
 There are a total of 8,471 gram panchayats in Bihar
 yahaan kii panchayaton ke faislon se kabhi bhi nari virdohi abhas nahin hua
 Whereas in Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, Khap panchayats are an orthodox part of society, which is unable to keep pace with modern society and changing ideology
 khap panchayaton main mahilaon or yuvaaon kaa pratinidhitiv na ke baraabar he
 If we study the mood and social structure of these panchayats, then the things that come out are very disturbing
 jaise ki haryana, dilli, punjab or pashchimi uttar pradesh main khap panchayaton ke tahat aane vaale kshetron main ling anupaat sabase kharaab he
 Female feticide is also the highest
 bihar ke gramin samaaj kaa dhaancha kisi bhi str par haryana se mail nahin khaataa
 There is no question of gram panchayats
 par in do faislon ko dekhakar ye lag rahaa he ki yaa to sirf media kii surkhiyon main aane ke liye ye farmaan jari kiye gaye hai yaa phir vaaki in faislon par chintaa jataane kii zarurat he? Prime Minister Narendra Modi made the first expansion of the cabinet on Sunday, so everyone's eyes were on the portfolio of ministers

 chaar nae cabinet mantriyon kii baat karen to goa ke purv mukhyamantri or vistaar kii sabase ahm kadi manohar parrikar ko raksha mantralay saunpa gaya he
 Parrikar is a graduate from IIT Bombay
 unhen aise samay main raksha mantralay mila he jab sarkaar ne haal hi aakarshak raksha kshetra ko nijee udyogon ke liye khulaa chhod diya or yahi se pradhanmantri ke mek in india kii shuruyaat bhi hoti he
 Interestingly, all four cabinet ministers will be from Rajya Sabha
 yani sarkaar sirf loksabhaa ke bharose aage badhane kii niti nahin apnaane vaali he
 It is said that Suresh Prabhu from Haryana and Parrikar will enter the Rajya Sabha from UP
 prabhu bharose bhartiya railravivaar ko mantrimandal vistaar main manohar parrikar ke baad sabase adhik charchaa suresh prabhu kii rahi
 Apparently, one reason for this was the high-voltage drama of the bjp-shiv Sena, but the Modi government is confident of the ability of former CA Prabhu
 vah vaajapeyi sarkaar main urja mantri rah chuke hai, jabaki ab unhen rail mantralay kaa nayaa bhartiya rail kaa nayaa payalat banaaya gaya he
 The deficit in railways is a major concern for the country's economy
 lekin ise sudhaarney ke kram main yatriyon kii jeb par boj nahin badhaane kaa daayitv bhi prabhu ke hi haath main he
 That is, along with development, vote creation is also necessary because BJP will want to stay in the center of power for 10 years

 But under the pretext of UP, there is a policy to practice Punjab
 katheria ke haathon punjab main bijepi kii kaman he
 After the separation from Shiv Sena in Maharashtra, a round of discussions has started regarding the bjp-akali Dal alliance in Punjab
 agar bijepi 'ekala chalo' kii raah pakadati he to katheria 'hukum kaa ikkaa' sabit ho sakate hai
 He is a Dalit face and 35% of the voters in Punjab are Dalits
 iske alaava punjab se vijay saanpala bhi bijepi ke vijay rath main dhwajvahak kii bhoomika nibhaa sakate hai

 mahendra singh dhoni kii team main srilanka or austrailia par lagaataar jeet se nayaa josh bhar gaya he or uski bahucharchit roteshan niti bhi ab tak sahi chal rahi he
 Despite Sachin Tendulkar being fit and available for the match, no one could think of resting but it was done in yesterday's match against Australia
 asal main bhartiya team ke paas kai vikalp maujuud he tathaa praveen kumaar or rahul sharma jaise pratibhashali khilaadi bhi ab apana jalawaa dikhaane ke liye taiyaar hai
 The Sri Lankan team has not recorded a single win in the tournament so far but it will not be easy to defeat them
 perth main bharat or austrailia donon ko usne pareshaani main daalaa lekin anukool parinaam hasil karne main asafal rahe
 In the first match, he gave India a chance to recover from 181 runs for six wickets, while he needed only one shot to win over Australia
 srilanka ke sabase anbhavi ballebaaj kumaar sangakaara or mahela jayavardhane edilade ovel kii ballebaaji ke liye anukool pich par acha pradarshan kar sakate hai
 Both of them failed in the first two matches but during this time they definitely indicated that they can play big innings at any time
 lagata nahin ki srilanka apane antim ekadash main bahut adhik badlaav karegaa
 He could use the all-round ability of Tisara Perera in place of Dhammika Prasad but off-spinner Sachitra Senanayake is likely to remain in the squad as the Adelaide Oval pitch could give him a good bounce
 yahaan donon captain jayavardhane or dhoni ke bich bhi jang dekhne ko milegi
 The Sri Lankan captain always pays attention to the attack and does not adopt a defensive attitude even when the batsmen of the opposing team are performing well
 australia ko unhone apni is ranneeti se baikfoot par bhej diya tha or bharat ke khilaaf bhi vah kal aisa kar sakate hai
 Dhoni, on the other hand, puts the fielders on one side of the wicket and asks the bowlers to bowl on a consistent line
 bhartiya captain ko lakshya kaa peechha karnaa adhik sahaj lagata he or yadi bharat phir se lakshya kaa peechha karata he to kisi ko hairaani nahin honi chahie
 India have chased the target so far in all three matches
 melbern main barish se prabhavit match main yah unhen yah mahangaa padaa lekin agle do match main vah jeet darj karne main safal rahaa

 On Wednesday, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee gave special instructions in this regard to state DGP Surjit Kar Purkayastha
 ramanavami 25 march ko he
 Addressing a meeting in Birbhum district, Mamata Banerjee said, 'there are some organizations which carry out traditional processions with arms

 Only those organizations that have been holding such rallies for the last 50 or 100 years will be allowed to do so

 pichley kuch dashakon se yahaan par bani sarkaron par pakshpaat ravaiya apnaane or kanoon vyavastha ko thik se nahin sambhaal paane ke aarope lagate rahe hai
 Not being able to properly implement law and order in the state was one of the main reasons for the defeat in the recent elections of the previous government
 kai baar to aisa laga ki saarvajanik taur par sangeen aparaadhon ke maamalon main bhi police apane kaa sanvaidhanik or kanoonee dayitvon ko nibhaane main tatpar nahin he
 Even the people of the political fraternity, who should be directly concerned with the public, should remain silent in some cases and the public is constantly being harassed
 rajya main satta main badlaav kaa kaaran bani aisi sthiti main ab rajya kii kaman prachand bahumat se jeet kar aane vaali party bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) yaa kahen bijepi ne ek yogi ke haath main de di he
 In Sanatan Dharma, a yogi is said to be away from the mess of public life and absorbed in godly devotion
 ek yogi kaa kisi se lagaav nahin rah jaataa or na kisi prakaar se laalach kii ummid rah jaati he
 It is another matter that some Yogis are allegedly adopting politics as a medium to fulfill their social responsibilities and in such a situation they have got the most opportunity for politics in BJP
 bijepi main aise yogi vidhansabha or sansad kaa rasta tay kar chuke hai
 Now for the first time, a yogi is a head of a state in a Yogi country and this province is also the most important in the country politically and the most challenging in terms of law and order
 desh main pradhanmantri narendra modi kii sarkaar or rajya main yogi adityanath kii sarkaar he
 Both governments belong to the BJP and both have won the people with a large majority
 dekha jaae to desh ko bhi pradhanmantri narendra modi ke rup main ek yogi hi chalaa rahaa he or desh ke sabase badi jansankhya vaale rajya main ek yogi satta ke sheersh par he
 From here it is certain that for the first time a comparison between a PM and a Chief Minister will continue to be a matter of discussion for the people
 piem modi jahaan kadak mizaaj ke liye jane jate hai vahiin yogi adityanath abhi tak to keval firebrand netaa kii chhavi main kaid hokar rah gaye hai
 While PM Modi became the Prime Minister after being installed as the Chief Minister of Gujarat as a skilled administrator, Yogi Adityanath has to face the toughest test to prove himself as a skilled administrator
 isamen koi do raay nahin he ki yogi adityanath kii apane sansadeey kshetra main lokapriyata kisi bhi myne main kam nahin he
 Not only as the Mahant of the bench, he has put the development works on the ground there and the proof of this is seen by increasing difference of his victory in every election
 prashasan main aap yojanaon ko keval lagu hi karte hai jarurat ke hisaab se anumati ke baad yojanaon main badlaav laate hai or jab aap shashan main hote hai to yojanaayen bananaa sabase ahm kaam ho jaataa he
 Then bear the responsibility of getting it implemented, that is to ensure that your ideology reaches the ground and it reaches the last person of every society, every class
 yogi adityanath kii sarkaar ab do din kii ho chuki he
 There have been two murders in the state in two days
 ek hatya raajnneetik hatya bataai ja rahi he
 It is in a way a challenge to Yogi Adityanath that the criminals of the state have challenged him as soon as he comes to power
 is ghatana ko gambhirtha se lene ke bajaay rajya kaa mantriparishad abhi laal batti ke maje lene main vyast najar aa rahaa he
 On Monday, ministers also paid a courtesy call to the Governor
 parichay karavaaya gaya or aisa lag rahaa tha ki rajbhavan ke baahar khadey media ke saamne yogi ke main mantri apane ko viipi darshane main vyast hon
 The media stood tall, one by one the cars with red lights came on
 kaaren ain or chali jaati to thik, lekin media premi bijepi ke netaaon ko ab yaad rakhana chahie ki vah mantri jinpar keval media main airtime khaane kaa kaam hi nahin bachaa he
 It was seen that the minister was coming out of his red light car from Raj Bhavan and stopped seeing the crowd of media persons
 jab tak media vaale jaise jane ko na kahen tab tak puure itaminan se mantri ji laal batti car main baithkar bite de rahe the
 The situation was that the minister was not far behind in showing what he had got from the residence of Governor Ram Naik
 jab bheetar koi khaas baatcheet hi nahin hui thi tab ek ke baad ek mantri media se baatcheet kyon kar rahaa tha yah samaj se pare tha
 Almost everyone told that there was only tea snack inside and was introduced to the governor
 rajya main mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ke alaava do upmukhyamantri hai
 Dinesh Sharma and Keshav Prasad Maurya
 inke alaava 44 mantriyon kii fouj bhi he
 The statement made on the assassination of Javid Ahmed, who was appointed as the Chief of Police of the state during the Samajwadi Party government, was itself showing that only he was concerned about the law and order in the state
 jabaran badbolapan or viviipi culture ke daayre se kab desh ke netaa baahar aate hai or kab apane ko saamaanya naagarik samajhenge yah desh or desh kaa har naagarik dekhne ko taras rahaa he
 These leaders and ministers should take a lesson from this that while the Congress Party government in Punjab is formed under the leadership of Captain Amarinder Singh and the Captain has made his subordinates clear that no minister will walk in a car with a red light, whereas the U
P
 The minister is still busy stating his VVIP
 in mantriyon ke saamne keval punjab kii congress sarkaar kaa udhaaharan nahin he, centre kii pradhanmantri narendra modi sarkaar ke mantriyon ko bhi dekh sakate hai
 The minister does not even speak on the unnecessary thing, at times it seems that the media is lagging behind and the minister measures his way without speaking
 sabase badi aashcharya kii baat to yah rahi he ki donon hatyaon par kisi bhi media vaale ne koi sawaal jawaab nahin kiya
 So why was the media fair? ho saktaa he ki media apane ko samajhadaar dikhaane main vyast ho ki abhi mantralayon kaa bantwaaraa nahin hua he isliye sabhi ko kuch scope miltaa he javabdehi se bachane kaa
 But there was no such question in front of the media
 dekha jaae to kisi bhi cabinet mantri ke saamne bhi yah chhot uplabdh nahin he ki use abhi kisi mantralay kii jimmedaari saunpi nahin gai he
 One thing that seemed clear was that Yogi Adityanath may have to face some chaos even in the cabinet in the state itself 
 mantrimandal main kuch mantri aise hai jo apane ko kendriya netritv ke kareeb pate hai or mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ke liye ye log tedi kheer sabit hone ja rahe hai
 If Yogi Adityanath does not control such ministers soon, he may face a lot of problems and here he will not be able to become a Yogi and leave the responsibility
 tippaniyan In a meeting with the top officials of the state, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has given the bjp's resolution letter to everyone
 mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ne shuruyaat to thik kii he, apane adhikariyon or mantriyon se apni sampatti kaa byoraa dene ko kaha he, lekin is prakaar ke kadam bhrashtachar ko rokane main cosmetic kadam hi sabit hote rahe hai
 Orders have been given to all that in which direction the government will work in the state and how their path will be decided
 lekin apane mantriyon ko abhi yogi yah nirdesh nahin de paae hai
 The state is large and the challenges are also many, which is not possible to solve in a day
 lekin drudh nishchay ke saath sarkarein aagen badhen to janata ko laabh milanaa or rajya or desh kaa vikaas path par agrasar hona tay he
 It is important that governments meet the expectations of the people
 piem narendra modi ne apni chunavi sabhaaon main baar baar vaada kiya tha ki rajya ke kisaanon kaa karj maaf kiya jayega
 First he kept talking for 14 days and then started saying that this decision will be taken in the first cabinet meeting itself
 ab samay aa gaya he ki janata yogi adityanath kii sarkaar se puche ki cabinet kii vah pehali baithak kab hogi or rajya ke liye karj maafee kaa sabase bad elaan kab hoga
 Will Yogi forget PM Modi's promise to the public? 
 
 sanathan dharm main ek yogi swayan ko saarvajanik jivan ke jhanjhaavaton se dur kar ishwar bhakthi main leen bataaya jaataa he
 a yogi has no attachment to anyone and there is no hope of greed in any way
 yah alag baat he ki kathith taur par kuch yogi apni saamaajik jimmedaariyon ko nibhaane ke liye raajnneeti ko ek madhyam ke rup main apanaate hai or aise main bijepi main unhen raajnneeti kaa sabase zyada avasar miltaa rahaa he
 In the BJP, such Yogis have come the way of assembly and parliament
 ab pehali baar he ki gerua vastradhari ek yogi desh main kisi soobe kaa mukhiya he or yah suba desh main raajnneetik drushti se sabase ahm bhi he or kanoon vyavastha kii najar main sabase chunauteepurn bhi he
 There is Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government in the country and Yogi Adityanath's government in the state
 donon hi sarkarein bijepi kii hai or donon ko hi logon ko khaasi bahumat se jitayaa he
 If seen, the country is also being run by a yogi in the form of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and a yogi is at the helm of power in the country's largest populous state
 yahaan se yah to tay he ki ek piem or ek mukhyamantri pehali baar pal-pal kii tulana hona logon ke liye charchaa kaa vishay bana rahegaa
 While PM Modi is known for his tough temper, Yogi Adityanath is still imprisoned only in the image of a firebrand leader
 piem modi ek kushal prashaasak ke taur par gujarat ke mukhyamantri ke taur par sthapit hone ke baad piem bane vahiin yogi adityanath ko saamne apane ko kushal prashaasak sabit karne kii sabase kathin pariksha kaa saamana karnaa he
 There is no doubt that Yogi Adityanath's popularity in his constituency is not diminished in any sense
 keval ke peeth ke mahant ke naate hi nahin unhone vahaan par vikaas ke kaamon ko dharaatal par utaara he or is baat kaa pramaan har chunaav main unki jeet kaa antar badhane se dekhne ko mil jaataa he
 In administration, you only implement the schemes, according to the need, you change the plans after the permission and when you are in governance, making plans becomes the most important task
 phir uske lagu karwaane kii jimmedaari vahan karnaa, yani aapaki vichaardhaara jameen tak pahunche or uske har samaaj, har varg ke antim vyakti tak vah pahunche yah sunishchat karnaa sabase ahm ho jaataa he
 Yogi Adityanath's government is now two days old
 rajya main do dinon main do hatyaein ho chuki hai
 a murder is said to be a political murder
 yah ek prakaar se yogi adityanath ke chunauti he ki unke satta main aate hi rajya ke bekhauf aparaadhiyon ne unhen lalakaara he
 Instead of taking this incident seriously, the State Council of Ministers seems to be busy enjoying the red light
 somvaar ko lagbhag bhi mantriyon ne rajyapal se shishtachar bhent kii
 Introduced and it seemed that in front of the media standing outside the Raj Bhavan, Yogi's ministers should be busy showing themselves as vips
 media kaa hujum khadaa tha ek ek kar lalabatti lagi kaaren aati gayi
 Cars would have come and gone, but the media savvy BJP leaders should now remember that the minister on whom only the airtime food is left in the media
 dekhne main aayaa ki rajbhavan se mantri apni laal batti car se baahar aa rahaa he or mediawaalon kii bheed dekhakar ruk jaataa he
 Until the media did not ask to leave, the minister was sitting in a red light giving baits in the car
 halaat to yah the ki mantri ji yah dikhaane main bhi peeche nahin the ki unhen rajyapal ram nike ke nivas se kya bhent mili he
 When there was no specific conversation within, then why one minister after another was interacting with the media was beyond comprehension
 lagbhag sabhi ne yah bataaya ki bheetar keval chaay naashtaa hua or rajyapal se parichay hua
 The state has two Deputy Chief Ministers besides Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath
 dinesh sharma or keshav prasad maury
 Apart from these, there is an army of 44 ministers
 samaajawaadee party sarkaar ke dauraan rajya ke police pramukh niyukt kiye gaye jaavid ahamed kaa hatya par diya gaya bayaan apane aap main yah dikhaa rahaa tha ki keval unhen hi rajya main kanoon vyavastha kii chintaa he
 When the country's leaders come out of the realm of forced babbling and VVIP culture and when they will consider themselves ordinary citizens, every citizen of this country and country is yearning to see
 in netaaon or mantriyon ko is baat se sabak lenaa chahie ki jahaan punjab main congress party kii sarkaar captain amarinder singh ke netritv main bani he or captain ne apane adhinsthon ko saaf kar diya he ki koi bhi mantri lalabatti lagi car main nahin chalegaa vahiin upi ke mantri abhi apane viviipi bataane main hi lage hai
 In front of these ministers, there is not only the example of the Congress government of Punjab, the Prime Minister can also see the ministers of the Narendra Modi government
 gaiyr jaruri baat par mantri bolte hi nahin he, kai baar to aisa lagata he ki media peeche padaa he or mantri ji bina bole hi apana rasta naap lete hai
 The biggest surprise has been that no media has answered any question on both murders
 to aakhir media kaa mela laga kyon tha
 Maybe the media is busy showing itself to be sensible that ministries have not been divided so everyone gets some scope to avoid accountability
 lekin media ke saamne to aisa koi prashn nahin tha
 If seen, this exemption is not available even before any cabinet minister that he has not been entrusted with the responsibility of any ministry
 ek baat jo spasht najar aa rahi thi ki rajya main hi mantrimandal main bhi yogi adityanath ko kuch araajaktaa kaa saamana karnaa pad saktaa he
 There are some ministers in the cabinet who find themselves close to the central leadership and for the Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath these people are going to prove to be crooked
 yadi jald hi yogi adityanath ne aise mantriyon ko kaabo nahin kiya to unhen baari dikkaton kaa saamana karnaa pad saktaa he or yahaan par vah yogi nahin ban paaenge ki jimmedaari chhod kar chale jaaen
 The comments rajya ke aalaa adhikariyon ke saath baithak main mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ne sabhi ko bijepi kaa sankalp patr thama diya he
 Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has made a good start, asking his officers and ministers to give details of their assets, but such steps have proved to be cosmetic steps to curb corruption
 sabhi ko yah aadesh de die gaye hai ki rajya main kis disha main sarkaar kaam karegi or unka maarg kis prakaar tay hoga
 But Yogi has not been able to give this instruction to his ministers yet
 rajya bada he or chunautiyaan bhi kai hai jinka samaadhaan ek din main sambhav nahin he
 But with the firm determination that if the fires rise, then the people are sure to benefit and the state and the country are set to move on the development path
 jaruri yah he ki logon kii ummiido par sarkarein khari utren
 PM Narendra Modi had repeatedly promised in his election meetings that the debt of the farmers of the state would be forgiven
 pehle vah 14 din kii baat kehete rahe phir kehane lage ki pehali cabinet baithak main hi yah nirnay le liya jayega
 Now the time has come when the public should ask Yogi Adityanath's government when that first cabinet meeting will be held and when will the biggest announcement of loan waiver for the state be made
 kya yogi piem modi dwaara janata se kiya vaada bhul jaaenge

 These leaders and ministers should take a lesson from this that while the Congress Party government in Punjab is formed under the leadership of Captain Amarinder Singh and the Captain has made his subordinates clear that no minister will walk in a car with a red light, whereas the U
P
 The minister is still busy stating his VVIP
 in mantriyon ke saamne keval punjab kii congress sarkaar kaa udhaaharan nahin he, centre kii pradhanmantri narendra modi sarkaar ke mantriyon ko bhi dekh sakate hai
 The minister does not even speak on the unnecessary thing, at times it seems that the media is lagging behind and the minister measures his way without speaking
 sabase badi aashcharya kii baat to yah rahi he ki donon hatyaon par kisi bhi media vaale ne koi sawaal jawaab nahin kiya
 So why was the media fair? ho saktaa he ki media apane ko samajhadaar dikhaane main vyast ho ki abhi mantralayon kaa bantwaaraa nahin hua he isliye sabhi ko kuch scope miltaa he javabdehi se bachane kaa
 But there was no such question in front of the media
 dekha jaae to kisi bhi cabinet mantri ke saamne bhi yah chhot uplabdh nahin he ki use abhi kisi mantralay kii jimmedaari saunpi nahin gai he
 One thing that seemed clear was that Yogi Adityanath may have to face some chaos even in the cabinet in the state itself
 mantrimandal main kuch mantri aise hai jo apane ko kendriya netritv ke kareeb pate hai or mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ke liye ye log tedi kheer sabit hone ja rahe hai
 If Yogi Adityanath does not control such ministers soon, he may face a lot of problems and here he will not be able to become a Yogi and leave the responsibility

 First he kept talking for 14 days and then started saying that this decision will be taken in the first cabinet meeting itself
 ab samay aa gaya he ki janata yogi adityanath kii sarkaar se puche ki cabinet kii vah pehali baithak kab hogi or rajya ke liye karj maafee kaa sabase bad elaan kab hoga
 Will Yogi forget PM Modi's promise to the public?

 mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ne shuruyaat to thik kii he, apane adhikariyon or mantriyon se apni sampatti kaa byoraa dene ko kaha he, lekin is prakaar ke kadam bhrashtachar ko rokane main cosmetic kadam hi sabit hote rahe hai
 Orders have been given to all that in which direction the government will work in the state and how their path will be decided
 lekin apane mantriyon ko abhi yogi yah nirdesh nahin de paae hai
 The state is large and the challenges are also many, which is not possible to solve in a day
 lekin drudh nishchay ke saath sarkarein aagen badhen to janata ko laabh milanaa or rajya or desh kaa vikaas path par agrasar hona tay he
 It is important that governments meet the expectations of the people
 piem narendra modi ne apni chunavi sabhaaon main baar baar vaada kiya tha ki rajya ke kisaanon kaa karj maaf kiya jayega
 First he kept talking for 14 days and then started saying that this decision will be taken in the first cabinet meeting itself
 ab samay aa gaya he ki janata yogi adityanath kii sarkaar se puche ki cabinet kii vah pehali baithak kab hogi or rajya ke liye karj maafee kaa sabase bad elaan kab hoga
 Will Yogi forget PM Modi's promise to the public? 
 
 ek baat jo spasht najar aa rahi thi ki rajya main hi mantrimandal main bhi yogi adityanath ko kuch araajaktaa kaa saamana karnaa pad saktaa he
 There are some ministers in the cabinet who find themselves close to the central leadership and for the Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath these people are going to prove to be crooked
 yadi jald hi yogi adityanath ne aise mantriyon ko kaabo nahin kiya to unhen baari dikkaton kaa saamana karnaa pad saktaa he or yahaan par vah yogi nahin ban paaenge ki jimmedaari chhod kar chale jaaen
 The comments rajya ke aalaa adhikariyon ke saath baithak main mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ne sabhi ko bijepi kaa sankalp patr thama diya he
 Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has made a good start, asking his officers and ministers to give details of their assets, but such steps have proved to be cosmetic steps to curb corruption
 sabhi ko yah aadesh de die gaye hai ki rajya main kis disha main sarkaar kaam karegi or unka maarg kis prakaar tay hoga
 But Yogi has not been able to give this instruction to his ministers yet
 rajya bada he or chunautiyaan bhi kai hai jinka samaadhaan ek din main sambhav nahin he
 But with the firm determination that if the fires rise, then the people are sure to benefit and the state and the country are set to move on the development path
 jaruri yah he ki logon kii ummiido par sarkarein khari utren
 PM Narendra Modi had repeatedly promised in his election meetings that the debt of the farmers of the state would be forgiven
 pehle vah 14 din kii baat kehete rahe phir kehane lage ki pehali cabinet baithak main hi yah nirnay le liya jayega
 Now the time has come when the public should ask Yogi Adityanath's government when that first cabinet meeting will be held and when will the biggest announcement of loan waiver for the state be made
 kya yogi piem modi dwaara janata se kiya vaada bhul jaaenge

 Wisden Almanac, in its 150th edition, strongly criticized Kevin Pietersen, calling the star batsman's behavior "arrogant" during the series between South Africa and England last year
 tab esemes prakaran ke kaaran petersan ko team se baahar hona padaa tha
 In the latest edition of Almanac, Laurence Booth wrote in his editorial that the hefty amount of money that Peterson is receiving from his contract in the IPL has made him so courageous that England and Wales are not adequately honoring his contract with the Cricket Board 
 tippaniyan The interesting fact is that Pietersen is not playing in IPL six this time due to injury
 booth ne likhaa he, ‘‘kuch ko lagata he ki petersan kii sanak ke vistaar ke rup main hi cricket kaa astitv he
 (and it definitely has an 'I' rather than a team for cricket) With the signing of a hefty amount in the Indian Premier League, he (peterson) has become a crocodile and is trying to dominate the terms of his central contract
 ’’ Pietersen smashed the South African players and told them how to dismiss England captain Andrew Strauss
 booth ne iske bachakaani harakat qaraar diya he
 Wisden also strongly criticized the ECB for not handling the issue properly
 almanak ke taaja sanskaran main larens booth ne apane sampadakeey main likhaa he ki ipel main anubandh se petersan ko jo moti dhanrashi mil rahi he usase vah itnaa saahsee ban gaya he ki england evam wales cricket board ke saath apane anubandh kaa paryaapt sammaan nahin kar rahaa he
 The comments dilachasp tathy yah he ki chot ke kaaran petersan is baar ipel chah main nahin khel paa rahe hai
 Booth wrote, "some feel that cricket exists only as an extension of Peterson's craze
" (or isamen cricket ke liye team ke bajaay nishchit taur par ‘main’ he) indian premier lig main moti dhanrashi kaa qaraar hone se vah (petersan) magarur ban gaya he or apane kendriya anubandh kii sharton par haaavee hone kii koshish kar rahaa he
 '' petersan ne dakshin africa ke khilaadiyon ko esemes karke unhen england ke captain andrew straas ko out karne kaa tarika bataaya tha

 vijaden ne is masale se sahi tarah se nahin nibatane ke liye isibi kii bhi kadi aalochana kii
 He has returned again
 saal bhar kii khamoshi ke baad
 Breaking the old promise for a year
 choron kii duniya kaa sabase bada or sabase shaatir chor jiske naam bhar se dilli police or dilli waalon kii neend ud jaati thi, wo phir se apane puraane kaam par laut aayaa he
 Now that he has returned, our only request from you is to be smart
 ji haa, natwar se bhi bada natvarlaal
 The most vicious thieves in the world of theft
 ek aisa super chor jiskaa naam bhar sunate hi logon kii neenden ud jaaya karti hai
 Whose feeling of presence robbed the policemen peacefully
 dilli kii galiyon se lekar mumbai ke bollywood tak jiske naam kaa shor he
 Who sneaked into the Big Boss house
 vahi ustad banty chor phir se kaam par lag gaya he
 And his job is theft
 kareeb saal bhar pehle jail se aaazaad hone ke baad banty ne baqayada camere par vaada kiya tha
 Promise to improve
 vaada chori chhod dene kaa
 Promise to be a better person
 par banty saal bhar bhi apana vaada nahin nibhaa sakaa
 And he entered a jeweler's shop
 or apana kaam kar gaya
 This is the same thief who has no record of theft in his name
 ye vahi banty he jiske paas kabhi aaleeshaan gadiyaan hoti thim
 Bunty once had a lot of money
 daulat uske kadamon main hua karti thi
 When he was caught, newspaper headlines would be made
 jab jail jaataa to police ko elania chunauti dekar jaataa ki main waapas lautakar aauungaa
 And literally five-five times Bunty has run away from police custody
 hathkadi kholane main banty maahir tha
 When Bunty was last caught in 2004, a special handcuff was ordered from America for him
 jail main rakhane ke liye khaas intazaam kiye gaye the
 Even he did not run away, so he was kept in a cell made for terrorists
 2010 main big bos ke ghar se baahar nikalne ke baad banty achaanak gaayab ho gaya tha
 And now for the first time he was seen in a CCTV camera
 aakhir kya he is sisitivi camere kaa raaj? kya kar rah he yahaan is vakt banty? or kya lekar aayaa he wo apane saath is dukaan main? to pesh he super chor banty kii sabase nai karstani
 In 2010, he promised on camera that he would now give up the theft
 yahaan tak ki jab wo big bos ke ghar ke andar ja rahaa tha tab usne salmaan khan tak ko tok diya tha ki wo use chor kah kar naa bulaaen
 But the same Bunty has suddenly returned to its old form after a year of silence
 uskaa ye rup shaayad hi itani jaldi saamne aata
 
 par sisitivi camere ne use pakad liya
 Bunty started an old job in the new year
 9 janvari, dopaher ke 12 bajkar 38 minute, anupam jewalers, palaval, faridabad
 a man wearing a hat comes to this showroom
 par andar counter par tab koi nahin tha
 So he walks for a while in the showroom and then exits
 kuch der baad jaise hi showrooms kaa maalik counter par aakar baithta he topi pahane vahi shaks dobaaraa andar aata he
 This time he has a bag in his hand
 ab wo counter par hi bag kholta he or andar se ek-ek kar saamaan baahar nikaalata jaataa he
 The bag contained silver plates and gold jewelery
 dukandaar jevaraat dekhtaa jaataa he or bich-bich main us noujvaan ko bhi
 
 
 Who came here with jewelry
 darasal topi pahane noujvaan is dukaan main jevar bechney aayaa tha
 And right now the same jewelry is showing to the shopkeeper
 shaayad sauda pat bhi jaataa
 But there was a mess
 dukandaar ne jab dhyaan se topi pahane shaks kaa cheharaa dekha to use wo cheharaa janaa-pahachaanaa laga
 Then he insisted on his mind, then he recognized him immediately
 usne use tivi par khabaron main or big bos ke ghar main dekha tha
 It was none other than Superchor Bunty
 banty ko pahachaanate hi dukandaar ko sara maajaraa samaj main aa gaya
 But Bunty was also a super thief
 use bhi samajhane main der nahin lagi ki dukandaar use pahchaan gaya he
 So immediately he put all his goods back in the bag and ran away saying that he would sell it in Delhi
 par banty ke jate hi dukandaar ne fouran police ko isaki ittila de di
 He also told the police that he had gone towards Delhi in a car
 dukandaar ne car kaa number bhi note kar liya tha
 As soon as the news was received, the Faridabad police blocked the delhi-faridabad highway to nab him
 iske baad jaise hi usee number kii car police ke naake par pahunchi to police ne use rukne kaa ishaara kiya
 But instead of stopping Bunty, turning his car back, he escaped to the other side
 use bhaagta dekh pulisavaalon ne car kii taraf danda bhi phenkaa jisase car kaa pichhlaa sheesha to tut gaya par banty bhaag niklaa
 But Bunty went ahead and hit a buggy, which caused the vehicle's tire to burst
 iske baad wo gaadi ko ek gali main bhaga le gaya or vahiin gaadi chhod khud bhaag gaya
 Later, after examining the car, it was found that the car was stolen from New Friends Colony in Delhi on the morning of 9 January
 car kii talaashi lene par police ko gadee main se do viypi number plate, police kaa stikar, chaabiyon kaa guchha, videshi mahangi wine, cigarette ke packet or kuch kagajaat mili
 This is exactly how Bunty works
 wo jis ghar main chori karata chori kaa maal usee ghaki kii gaadi main rakh kar le jaataa
 This means that the old Superchor Bunty has returned once again
 kisi shaayar ne shaayad ye banty ke liye hi kaha he ki badnaam hue to kya hua, naam to hua? ji haa
 The secret of his fame is hidden in Bunty's infamy
 jise usne kamaaya
 
 chori karne ke apane khaas andaaj se
 Perhaps this is why the police, who have dodged his hands dozens of times, also sympathize with him
 chori ke kaam main itnaa naam kamaane kaa mauka yakeenan aaj se pehle kisi chor ko nahin mila
 But as it is said that nothing is achieved without hard work in this world, Bunty also left no stone unturned to master the art of theft
 ek vakt main dilli police ke dakshini jile kaa lagbhag har police vaala banty ke peeche tha
 Despite this, Bunty continued to dodge the police
 lekin uski faraari ke dauraan hui tafteesh se police ko itnaa phayda jarur hua ki wo uske kaam karne ke taur-tareeke ko baariki se samaj pai
 The secret of Bunty's success in the theft profession really depended on his trust in himself
 banty ne apane kaam main kabhi kisi duusare ko shariq nahin kiya
 He used to carry out all the incidents of theft alone and he was also so sure that the robber himself could not find out his robbery
 misaal ke taur par banty jab ek ghar main chori ke liye pahunchaa to sabase pehle uskaa saamana ghar ke chaukeedaar se hua
 Before the watchman stopped him and made some inquiries, he cited the owner of the house and lost such a sordid pitti on the watchman
 iske baad banty bade aaraam se ghar main ghusaa or vahaan se gaadi kii chaabi or laptop lekar baahar nikal aayaa
 Bunty told the watchman to go to the airport only at the behest of his boss and lost the vehicle and laptop stolen in front of his eyes
 mazedaar baat ye rahi ki chaukeedaar banty kii baton main kuch aisa aayaa ki jate-jate usne banty ko salaam bhi thonk diya
 In fact, Bunty harassed the Delhi Police so much that one team of policemen and forensic experts did a lot of research on how he worked
 iske baad puraani or nai choriyon kaa milan kiya gaya jisase uske haathon hui choriyon kaa ek khaas pattern saamne aa gaya
 All these incidents of theft were exactly like each other 
 or banty superchor ke pattern kii kuch khaas baaten ye raheen
 
 
 1
 banty sabhi choriyaan raat do baje se lekar subah chah baje ke bich hi karata tha
 2
 banty chori se pehle makaan main daakhil hone ke liye daravaaje yaa khidki kii gril ko ek lambe pechkas or liver kii madad se kholta tha
 Apart from this, he never used any other tool
 3
 Bunty always used to clean hands on very expensive items like luxury cars, jewelery, cutlery, foreign watches and antique furniture
 chori gayi saamaan main kabhi koi maamuli cheez shaamil nahin hoti
 Seeing Bunty's record, it seemed as if he considers stealing common things against his pride
 4
 Bunty never broke the lock of any car before stealing
 car kholane ke liye wo hameshaa car maalik ke ghar se churaai gai chaabi kaa istemaal hi karata tha
 5
 banty ke bare main ek or dilachasp baat thi
 He always rode in a car to steal
 or puraani car maukey par chhod wo maukey par mili nai car main faraar ho jaataa tha
 Surely this style of theft could have belonged to the same thief
 or apane puraane tajurbe ke bal par aisi kisi bhi chori ke saamne aate hi dilli police ke dimag main banty kii ghanti baj uthati
 That is why Bunty's capture was probably not as difficult the third time compared to the first and second time
 or ek kaamyaab chor kaa chori kaa kaamyaab tarika uski sabase badi kamajori ban gaya
 To say that he is a thief, but in this profession he has achieved that milestone, even if it is difficult for even a good thief to reach even a good person
 ankhon se kaajal churaane main maharath hasil kar chuke banty chor kaa naam un logon kii fehrist main shumaar ho chukaa he, jinaki jindagi ko baqayada filmi parde par utaara gaya
 Dream and reality insaani jindagi ke ye do bilkul alag pahalu hai
 There is no restriction in this world on dreaming, but it is important to keep an eye on reality
 peedi dar peedi bade buudhe yahi naseehat dete aae hai
 But there was probably no one to give this advice to Bunty
 isiliye banty ne jo khwab dekhe unhen sach kar dikhaanaa apni aadat bana lee
 Then, whether it is stealing precious vehicles and diamonds or jewels, or the passion to come on the film screen
 ye khwab banty ne dekha or sach bhi kar dikhaaya
 Yes, a film based on Bunty's character has been made
 naam he "oy lucky, lucky oy"
 In this film, Bunty is played by actor Abhay Deol
 or film banaai he khosla kaa ghosla jaisi hit film de chuke film-mekar dibaakar bannerjee ne
 Bunty's character really impressed him so much that the story of the film revolved around Bunty
 film ke kai plot sidhe super chor banty kii asal jindagi se uthaae gayi hai
 By the way, Dibakar wanted to take the real Bunty in his film
 magar chunki banty jail ke andar tha lihaaja shooting ke liye uski dats milane kaa sawaal hi nahin uthta tha
 In fact, Dibakar did a lot of research on Super Chor Bunty before taking his character in the film
 iske liye unhone dilli, mumbai, kolkata, chennai, bangalore, ahmedabad, chandigarh or ludhiana samet hindustan ke takreeban har bade shahar main maujuud banty kaa police record khangala
 These included more than 500 theft incidents
 bilkul kisi filmi chor kii tarj par
 But after research on Bunty, Dibakar understood that Bunty is better known for his special style than cleaning his hand
 wo andaaj jisaki vajah se usase ek baar milane vaala use jindagi bhar nahin bhuulataa
 Because there is that magic in Bunty's talk, due to which the looting of his hands is lost and he is not even aware of it
 ji haa, banty kii is adaa se aam log to kya khud police bhi achhuti nahin rahi he
 Bunty's tricking the policemen is a left-handed game
 super chor banty ne aisa kai maukon par kar dikhaaya he
 Sometimes by eating pieces of glass in police custody, sometimes by opening syringes with the help of syringes
 pichley das saalon main banty kai baar pakadaa gaya lekin wo har baar police ko chakma dekar bhaag nikalne main kaamyaab rahaa
 Bunty was last arrested by Delhi Police in April 2007
 jiske baad se hi wo dilli kii tihaad jail main band tha
 But even while in jail, Bunty did not stop dreaming
 wo tab bhi daawey ke saath kahata rahaa ki jail kii salakhen use zyada din tak roak nahin paaengi
 And finally the same thing happened
 haalanki is baar use jail yaa police hiraasat se bhaagane kii jarurat nahin padi
 On the contrary, the court acquitted him of his charges
 bollywood ke is super chor ne box offis par khub dhamal machaaya
 The film Oy Lucky Lucky Oy came out
 super chor hit ho gaya
 This Bunty of the screen is actually Super Thief Bunty too
 film isi super chor par bani thi
 It was a panic for Delhi
 police uski harkaton se hairaan-pareshaan thi
 He used to do every theft alone
 uski nazar hameshaa se lagjri car, julri, ctlori, videshi ghadiyaan or antic furniture par hoti thi
 He considered stealing small things against his pride
 lekin 2010 main 3 saal kii sazaa kaatane ke baad banty jab jail se baahar niklaa tab sir chupaane ke liye iske paas ek adad chat bhi nahin thi
 This vicious thief who once traveled in crores of vehicles became fascinated for a roof
 jail se nikalne ke baad banty ne khud kaha tha ki mujhe pehle ghar waalon ne bagaiyr kuch die nikaal diya, ab main jab jail se chhot kar aayaa hum, koi mujhe rakhane ko taiyaar nahin he
 Sometimes this vicious thief used to stay in big hotels
 par 10 june 2010 ko wo sazaa katkar jab tihaad jail se baahar aayaa to pehle bhai ke paas gaya lekin bhai ne apane badnaam bhai se koi bhi rishta rakhane se manaa kar diya
 Defeated, he reached Lodhi Colonni SHO Rajendra Singh
 ye vahi police afasar hai jinhone banty ko salaakhon ke peeche pahunchaaya tha
 It was Rajendra Singh who gave Bunty clothes and assured him to eat two times
 halaat se pareshaan banty puri tarah se tut gaya tha
 The girlfriend with whom he vowed to die, he married someone else after Bunty went to jail
 lekin banty kii yaadon main wo tab bhi basii thi
 Bunty had said that my girlfriend got married after going to jail, i will marry only when some business will freeze
 shaayad banty kaa beetaa hua kal uske aage aakar khadaa ho gaya tha
 And that's why he is back on the same path again
 yaa phir banty ko kabhi sudharna hi nahin tha

 film kaa naam:half garlfrenddiarector:mohit suristar cast:arjuna kapur, shraddha kapur, vikrant massi, riya chakravarti, seemaa biswajevadhi:2 ghanta 15 minutesrtificate:u / aretimga:2 stariter chetan bhagat kii nowell par 'hello', 'kaay po che', '3 idiyats', or '2 stats' jaisi filmein banaai gai hai, jisamen kai saxesphul bhi rahi hai
 Once again a film of the same name has been made based on Chetan's novel 'half Girlfriend', in which the story of the boy of Bihar and the girl of Delhi is told
 film ko 'aashiqui 2' or 'ek villen' jaisi hit film dene vaale mohit suri ne diarect kiya he
 Do you know how this film is made and how is the story of the film: Story: This story is of Madhav Jha (arjun Kapoor), resident of Dumraon village in Buxar district of Bihar, who goes from the village to Delhi to study and there He meets Riya Somani (shraddha Kapoor), a girl from a wealthy family
 madhav or riya donon ko hi basketbaal bahut pasand he
 The two meet on the basketball court itself
 madhav ko angreji nahin aati jisaki vajah se uskaa baar-baar majaak udaaya jaataa he
 Madhav's friend Shailesh (vikrant Massey) is always with him
 basketbaal ke baad badminton khelengi shraddha, cyna ke role main huin conformek din kuch aisa hota he, jisaki vajah se madhav or uski half garlfriend riya main algaav ho jaataa he
 Because of this, Madhav returns to his village and Riya escapes somewhere
 phir kahani main twist or terns aate hai or ek baar phir se madhav or riya kii mulaakaat alag paristhiti main hoti he
 The story then reaches London as well and is executed
 kamjor kadiyaan:film kii kahani kaaphi kamjor si he
 The screenplay is very cool that could be worked on
 jo baat chetan bhagat kii 2 stats or 3 idiyats jaisi filmon main thi, wo yahaan bilkul dekhne ko nahin milti he
 The dialogue of the film is also very weak and there is nothing special in romance and drama
 kisi bhi romantic film ko dekhte vakt insaan usamen kho janaa chahta he, lekin is film ke dauraan kuch aisa feel nahin ho paata he, jo ki screenple kii kami he
 The story has failed to tie up and the makers have been unable to tell which character ultimately wants to do what
 film kaa gaanaa 'phir bhi tumko chaahunga' logon ko yaad rah sakaa he
 The biggest ace of Mohit Suri's films is his music, which could have been improved even further
 is khaas lokation par shoot karne vaali pehali bhartiya film bani half garlfrendkyon dekhen film:film main arjuna kapur ne bihari ladke kaa kirdaar bakhubi nibhaayaa he
 He is seen playing the character
 vahin shraddha kapur ne bhi thik thaak kaam kiya he
 Vikrant Massey's work is effortless and the rest of the film's cast do a good job as well
 saath hi film kii loketions badhiya he
 Viewers will be seen in the film along with Delhi as well as New York
 vijual ke hisaab se film acchhee he or saath hi becoground score bhi kamaal kaa he
 After all, who called Shraddha Kapoor the most beautiful 'half Girlfriend' box office: The film is said to cost around 35 crores and according to the news its digital, satellite and overseas rights have already been sold
 ab dekhnaa kaaphi ahm hoga ki yah film kitne screens main relies kii jaaegi kyonki pehle se hi 'bahubali 2' kaaphi screens liye hue he or uske distributor ee films ke viki thadani is hafte relies ho rahi film 'hindi medium' ko distribute kar rahe hai
 For this reason, half-girlfriends may have problems with screens
 misr main jari sarkari virdohi pradarshnon kaa shanivaar ko 12waan din he
 Friday's deadline for opponents to President Husni Mubarak has also ended, but Mubarak is not willing to step down
 udhar america ke raashtrapati baraak obama ne bhi misr main satta hastantaran par jor dete hue kaha ki raashtrapati mubarak ko misr ke logon kii baat sunani chahie
 At the same time, Obama also strongly condemned the attacks on journalists, human rights activists and those who were performing in a peaceful manner
 obama ne kaha, misr ke sunahare bhavishya ke liye sirf ek hi baat kaam kar sakati he or vah he satta kaa shantipurna tareeke se hastantaran, jisamen sabhi dalon ke log shaamil hon
 Democratic parties should lead, have fair elections, have a responsible government, which will remove the troubles of Egyptians
 obama ne kaha ki jab mubarak khud hi kah chuke hai ki vah ab satta main nahin rahanaa chaahate, unhen sochna chahie ki is sankraman ke daur main vah apni kisi viraasat chhodkar janaa chaahate hai
 In a joint press conference with Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, Obama said, "I hope they (mubarak) take a right decision
" obama ne kaha ki unhone mubarak ko unki sarkaar main shaamil logon kii salaah lene kaa paraamarsh diya he
 He told that till now he has spoken to Mubarak twice
 america raashtrapati ne kaha, unhen misr ke logon kii baat sunne kii jarurat he
 And they have to decide for further paths, which are not only systematic but also correct and meaningful
 unhone kaha, ham misr ke logon kaa bhavishya tay nahin karenge
 But i have also said that given what has happened in the last two weeks, it is not right to return to the old days
 obama ne kaha, daman ab kargar nahin he
 Violence is also not useful
 soochnaaon kaa pravaah rokane kaa prayaas bhi ab prabhavi nahin rahaa he
 Describing the attacks on journalists, human rights activists and protesters as unacceptable, Obama said that his administration is closely monitoring the situation there
 obama ne kaha, haal ke dinon main hamane misr kii sadakon par hinsa or utpeedan hote dekha he
 It is a violation of human rights, global values and international norms
 unhone kaha, isliye ham ek aawaaj main ek drudh sandesh bhej rahe hai
 Attacks on journalists, human rights activists and peaceful protesters are unacceptable
 obama ne jor dekar kaha ki misr kaa maamla hinsa se hal nahin hoga
 He said that he was excited about the restraint on Friday and hoped that the same would happen in the future
 unhone kaha, misr main sthiti bahut najuk he or america behad gahari najar rakhe hue he
 Many prominent officials and experts from both India and the US have told US lawmakers that the bjp-led government at the Center in India would be harmful to the basic interests of religious minorities

 Katrina said that a large number of religious minority communities have told the commission that they fear the victory of BJP and the election of Narendra Modi as the Prime Minister of the country will be harmful for them and religious freedom
 bijepi ne 1998 or 2004 ke bich rashtriya sarkaar kaa netritv kiya tha
 He said that between 2002 and 2004, the commission recommended that the US State Ministry designate India as a country of particular concern (country of Particular Concern) for systematic, ongoing and shocking violations of religious freedom on behalf of the government
 katrina ne kaha ki ayog lambey samay se hindu rashtravaadi sanghathanon ke saath bijepi or modi ke nikat sambandhon par chintaa jataate aayaa he
 He said that the activities of these groups, especially the extremist agenda or organizations with a history of using violence against minorities, often negatively impact the status of religious freedom in the country
 ayog ke upaadhyaksh ne kaha ki inamen se dher saare samooh sangh parivaar ke binar tale hai
 There are about 30 organizations including Vishwa Hindu Parishad, Bajrang Dal and Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh among them
 aakraamakata ke liye jor daalata he sanghakatrina ne kaha ki sangh parivaar aakraamak rup se aisi sarkari nitiyon ke liye jor daalate hai jo hindu rashtravaadi agenda ko badhaava de or alag alag had tak hindutv kii vichaardhaara se jude hai jo gaiyr-hinduon ko videshi qaraar detii he
 Meanwhile, Tulsi Gabbard, the first ever Hindu MP of the US Parliament, questioned the timing of the parliamentary hearing, alleging that it aimed to influence the Indian election
 tulsi ne kaha ki main nahin maanati ki is sunwaayee kaa samay koi sanyog he
 National elections in India will begin on Monday and run till May 12
 main chintit hum ki is sunwaayee kaa lakshya bharat ke rashtriya chunaav ke nattejey ko prabhavit karnaa he jo america sansad ko koi uchit bhoomika nahin he
 People traveling by train often complain of dirt in the toilets there, but now the Indian Railways is considering to make toilets like airplanes in trains
 agar pareekshan safal hota he to hawaii jahaajon main dekha jane vaala vaikum toilet jald hi bhartiya railgadiyon main bhi ek vaastaviktaa ho saktaa he or ise 500 dibbon main lagaaya jayega
 a senior railway official said this on Thursday
 yahaan railway vikritaon ke liye ek aplicoshan ke shubharambh ke avasar parrel mantri piyush goyalane yah sweekaar kiya ki vaikum toilet jaev-shauchalayon kaa vikalp ho saktaa he
 Goyal said, 'after Lohanji (railway Board President Ashwani Lohani) came on the railway, he took a decision on vacuum toilet
 jaev-shauchalayon main jam or durgandh kii kuch samasyaayein huin
 The concerned department has resolved some problems and changes have been initiated
 ’lohani ne kaha ki railway jald hi praayogic aadhaar par 500 dibbon main aise shauchalay lagane kaa kaam shuru karegaa jahaan durgandh rokane ke liye shauchalayon main vaikum kii vyavastha kii jaaegi
 Luxury trains like Rajdhani have already been built with state-of-the-art bio-toilets
 rajdhani train main to bathroom main gijar, garm or thanda pani ko mix karne vaale dispencer or autogenitor bhi lagaae gaye hai
 Along with this, perfume sprays with detergents have also been applied in the bathroom
 toilet ko khubasurat dikhne ke liye synthetic marble kaa istemaal kiya gaya he
 Although the condition of toilets in ordinary trains is very poor, the negligence of passengers among them is also a big reason
 bisisiai ne teen neshnal selectaron kii selary badhaane ke saath ampiron, scorer or video vishleshkon kii fees doguni karne kaa faisla kiya
 The decision was taken by the Cricket Operation Wing headed by bcci's Saba Karim
 sioe ko bhi lagata he ki chif selector emesake prasad and company ko unki sevaaon kaa phayda milanaa chahie
 Interestingly, BCCI Treasurer Anirudh Chaudhary was not aware of the decision to increase salary
 abhi chairman ko salanaa 80 lakh rupee jabaki anya selectaron ko 60 lakh rupee mili rahe hai
 The decision to increase the salary was taken because the exclusion selectors Gagan Khoda and Jatin Paranjpe are receiving the same salary as Devang Gandhi and Sarandeep Singh
 test se nahin khatm hoga toss, ICC kii cameti ne kiya faisalabisisiai ke senior adhikari ne kaha, ‘selectaron kii niyuktiaghnmen hi ho sakati he, jatin or gagan seva nahin dene ke baavjood niyamon ke anusaar itani hi selary paa rahe hai
 This will not be right with Devang and Sarandeep, as they keep coming out of the country
 ’ummid he ab chif selector ko kareeb ek karod rupee milenge jabaki do anya selectaron ko 75 se 80 lakh rupee ke kareeb milenge
 The BCCI also decided to double the fees of domestic match referees, umpires, scorers and video analysts after a gap of six years
 fees badhaane kii sifarish sabaa kareem ne 12 april ko sioe ke saath baithak ke dauraan kii thi
 However, Treasurer Chaudhary was kept away from these financial decisions
 VIDEO: kohli ne bahaya jamkar pasinaa, england daure se pehle feet hona he targetbisisiai adhikari ne naam nahin bataane kii shart par kaha, ‘mujhe yaad he ki aniruddh ne pichley saal vittiya samiti kii baithak ke dauraan is badhotaree kaa suzav diya tha, lekin mujhe nahin lagata ki unhen is baar unhen is faisle main shaamil kiya gaya
