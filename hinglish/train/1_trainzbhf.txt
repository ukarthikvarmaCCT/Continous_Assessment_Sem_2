 Educationist and Associate Professor of Physics at DAV College, Kanpur, Drs
 manoj mishra kehete hai, 'upi ke purvi or pashchimi jilon se kanpur kii connactivity yahaan koching centre ke panpane kaa ek bada kaaran he
 There is a good education environment in Kanpur due to the establishment of Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Medical College, Engineering College, Polytechnic
 iskaa phayda yahaan ejineering or medical kii pravesh parikshaon kii taiyaari karne aane vaale students ko sahaj hi mil jaataa he

 juneja ne mathematics or dilip saradesai ne kakadev ilaake main physics kii koching dena shuru kiya
 This was the beginning of its transformation into a coaching hub of the region
 do saal ke bheetar yahaan ke koching market ne aakaar lenaa shuru kar diya
 Atul Kumar and Sanjay Kumar, who did btech from Kanpur IIT in 1992, laid the foundation of 'etsa' coaching center, which was the first integrated coaching center for engineering entrance examination in Kanpur in the area
 iske baad se kakadev or iske aasapaas ke ilaake gitanagar, naveennagar main bhi ejineering or medical koching centre khulne kaa silsilaa shuru ho gaya
 Today the situation is that more than 100 small and big centers are working in Kakadev and surrounding areas to prepare for engineering and medical entrance examinations alone
 in koching centre main mukhya rup se bhabha classes, new speed institute, sigma classes, new lite koching institute, raaj kushvaha classes or anis shrivastav classes hai
 Harsh Mishra of New Speed institute says that the coaching for engineering and medical entrance examinations in Kanpur is much cheaper than the quota of Rajasthan, the other big center in North India
 ve kehete hai, 'kanpur main enginiinrag ke ek subject kii koching fees 15,000 ru
 If annually, the total fees for the three subjects in medical is Rs 50,000
 ke kareeb baithti he jabaki kota main yahi fees 20 se 25 fisadi adhik he
 Due to low fees and excellent studies, the coaching centers of Kanpur are becoming increasingly popular among the students of North India
 'koching centaron ke bich badhati pratispardhaa se yahaan padhai ke taur-tareekon main bhi technology se jude kai tarah ke prayog najar aane lage hai
 Almost every big coaching institute here is working to assess the efficiency of students studying here through online tests
 iske alaava airkandishan classroom or librari kii suvidha dekar koching institute students ko lubhaa rahe hai
 But many coaching centers are also taking special care of poor children like Mahesh Chandra Chauhan of Bhabha Classes

 Neeraj Aggarwal established an IT company in Delhi
 is dauraan unhen dilli main bihar ke berozegaar yuvaaon se mulaakaat ke baad patna main shiksha kshetra main kuch karne kaa idia soojha
 So, he started with modest courses by setting up Simage (catalyst Institute of Management and Advanced Global Excellence) in the Ashok Rajpath area of patna in around 600 square feet, but after 12 years the size of this institute has increased to 36,000 square feet
 Professional courses like BBA, bsc-it, BJMC, msc-it, MCA, MBA, PGMC are given
 shuruyaat sirf degree corcej se hui thi, lekin students kii badhati jaruraton or shaikshanik sansthaanon ke bich hode kaa nateeja he ki pichley ek saal se institute ke safar main koching classes bhi jud gai hai, jisamen kareeb 2,000 students ko cat-mat, bank pio or emsie entrens exam ke liye koching classes karaae ja rahe hai
 Pro
 agarwal kehete hai, 'neshnal level ke compititive exam kii taiyaariyon or sarkari jobs main studants kii badhati dilchaspee ko dhyaan main rakhkar college students ke liye free koching classes sabase badi jarurat he, taaki students ko samgr shiksha di ja sake
 This expansion of Simage is a sign of the increasing imperative of coaching among students in Patna, the capital of Bihar
 yah aisa akelaa udhaaharan nahin he
 Anil Parmar, who started coaching in a garage in Kankarbagh, is now running an institute called Parmar Classes in Bailey Road and Boring Road in Kankarbagh, which prepares for engineering entrance exams
 patna main aise chote-bade koching institute kii sankhya 1,500 ko paar kar gai he
 Apparently, Rajasthan's quota was an option in front of Bihar students for engineering preparation
 lekin aisi sthiti tab tak rahi jab tak patna main gine-chune koching institute the
 For this reason, the inverted Ganga has started flowing
 haalanki aise udhaaharan kam hai, phir bhi pehle students kota jate the, lekin ab kota jaise prasiddh sthaan ke teachers patna main jamane lage hai
 There has also been an increase in the number of coaching for preparation of competition exam like banking, railway and SSC
 koching institute kii badhati sankhya or students kii badhati sweekaaryata ke kai vajahen hai
 Earlier, most coaching institutes were run to complete educational syllabus, which remained incomplete in educational institutions
 philhal, rajya main degree collejon kii sthiti ke dayaneey hote jane tathaa sarkari or gaiyr sarkari sansthaanon main jobs ke mil rahe maukon kii vajah se koching ek majboot vikalp ke taur par ubhar rahi he
 Teachers teaching physics in Patna
 shashi kumaar kehete hai ki ejineering ke silebus main badlaav se bhi koching ke vistaar ko bal mila he
 Children have no other way to understand the new syllabus in the state
 anya jagahon kii tulana main kam fees bhi koching se garib or madhyamvargeey students ko jodgaye kaa kaaran bani he
 Gulshan Kumar of Ghosatawan (nawada), who is preparing for engineering, says, 'about 3 in two years preparation in Kota
 5 lakh rupee kharch aata tha jo unke kisaan pita ke liye sambhav nahin tha, lekin patna main dedh lakh main course puraa karvaa diya jayega
 'it is not that coaching institutes in Patna are perfect from every point of view
 jis anupaat main koching kii taadaad badi he, us str tak suvidhaon kaa vistaar nahin he
 Although competition has increased in many ways due to the arrival of large capital, but there are many flaws as well
 is field main kai gaiyr-shaikshanik logon ke dakhal dene se mushkilen badi hai
 However, the state government has passed the Coaching Institute (control and Regulation) Bill-2010 to control this, under which several standards have been set
 lekin iske paalan kii sthiti santoshjanak nahin he
 Coaching institutes in Patna are taking shape as large industries and there is every possibility of their graph going up
 indoremadhya pradesh ke audyogic shahar indore main koching kaarobaar apane ufaan par he
 Every year about one and a half lakh students, after completing their studies, find shelter in these coaching institutes
 sthaneey koching centre rankers point ke diarector komal sharma bataate hai, 'ham log har saal 3,000 students kii iity, ames or anya institutes kii pravesh parikshaon ke liye taiyaari karavaate hai
 Aditi Mohta from Indore, who was ranked in the top 20 in AIIMS exam of Rankers Point, says, "I found the preparation environment very good in Indore and now i will advise other people to come here and prepare
" ” unka kahana ekadam sahi he, aakhir shahar main koching ke uchit maahaul ke saath hi nami sansthaanon ke aane se bhi kaaphi kuch badal gaya he
 In Indore, students from areas such as Neemuch, Jhabua, Alirajpur, Satna, Mandsaur and Ratlam are coming for engineering and doctoral coaching
 yahaan akaash or fitji jaise rashtriya str ke institute bhi apana thikaana bana chuke hai
 Coaching institutes like Brainmasters, Catalizers and Kalpavriksha are also becoming popular among children
 brinmasters ke diarector dow
 Pankaj Gupta says, “we educate 1,800 students who want to become doctors every year and a large number of them are successful
 'koching ke yahaan is tarah se badaae kii ek vajah iity or iiem kaa ek saath ek jagah hona bhi he
 This thing inspires the local children here, and they can study in their dream institute in their own city
 stretford academy ke diarector anand kaatcovar kehete hai, 'ejineering or medical ke kshetra main yahaan se jane vaale students kii sankhya ke maamne main indore badhibia pradarshan kar rahaa he
 'this trend is going to continue
 aaj ejineering, medical or management se jude corcej behtareen kariyar kii guarantee ban rahe hai
 By spreading the wings of possibilities at the international level, competition has increased manifold, we also get indications from the cutoff of class XII every year
 aise maahaul main agar koi raah dikhaane vaala mil jaae to usase behatar kya ho saktaa he
 It's not like you can't do anything without coaching
 koching ke bina bhi kamyaabi sambhav he lekin stareey koching lene se kamyaabi kii raah ko aasaan kiya ja saktaa he
 That is why arrangements are being made for coaching for iits and medical from sixth grade
 is tarah ek majboot base bananaa shuru ho jaataa he
 With this, the milestones of the career path are completed without any hindrance
 lekin ek baat kaa dhyaan rakhen ki koching ko apni takat banaaen, baisakhi nahin
 'make coaching not your strength, make your strength' Praveen Malhotra, Career Counselor Today, engineering, medical and management related courses are becoming a guarantee of excellent career
 antarrashtriya str par sambhaavnaaon ke pankh failaane se pratispardhaa main kai guna ijapha hua he, iske sanket hamen har saal barahavin kaksha kii katof se bhi mili jate hai
 In such an environment, what could be better than finding a wayfarer
 aisa nahin he ki aap koching ke bina kuch nahin kar sakate
 Success is possible even without coaching, but by taking level coaching the path to success can be made easier
 isiilie ab iity or medical ke liye chhathi class se koching kii vyavastha hone lagi he
 In this way a strong base begins to form
 isse kariyar kii raah ke milastone bina kisi baadha ke puure hote jate hai
 But keep in mind one thing that make coaching your strength, not crutches
 kyon len koching?koching kai myanon main kargar ho sakati he
 As students see many other people like themselves working hard, that is why they remain interested in their studies
 akele taiyaari karne se lambii avadhi main focus par asar padane kaa khatra bana rahata he
 Mock tests are also one of the biggest advantages of coaching
 samay-samay par hone vaale ye test students ko vishay ko samajhane kaa mauka dete hai or unhen yah bhi pataa chal jaataa he ki ve kitne pani main hai
 Coaching centers help students understand which section should be done
 students ko apni kamiyon kaa pataa chalata he or ve yah bhi jaanate hai ki unhen apana koun-sa paksh majboot karnaa he
 Then, whatever problem you have, the solvers are present here, but the problem in self study is waiting for help while in coaching the problem is solved in a jiffy
 chaahe iity ke exam hon yaa phir premedical test, inkaa base ensiiarti kii kitaaben hi hoti hai
 Because of this, coaching centers clear the fundamental fundamentals of students
 isse skool kii padhai bhi majboot ho jaati he
 It becomes revision
 lekin is baat kaa hameshaa dhyaan rakhen ki class main dhyaan dena na choden
 Many children think that if they are taking coaching then all will be done
 lekin aisa katai nahin he
 You have to work hard on your own
 koching se pehle rakhen dhyanasbase pehle apni capacity ko pahachaanen
 Whether IIT or medical, hard work is required
 isliye soch-samajhakar hi faisla len
 Parents should also not impose their decisions on children
 agar aap kisi shankaa ke saath koching join bhi kar lete hai to koshish karen ki puure paise ek saath na den
 Try the initiatives first
 agar manage na kar paaen to jabardastee katai nahin kerani chahie
 Nothing good can be expected by putting pressure on oneself
 saavdhaaniyaan baratenaaj badi-badi dingen haankane vaale koching centre kukuramutton kii tarah ug aae hai
 Before choosing the institute, get a good information about it
 jaise, faikalti kisi he
 Do not believe what is heard, because there can be many types of deception due to the franchise system
 institute ke puraane nateezon ko achche se khangaalen
 Meet alumni
 join karne se pehle trial claces ke liye bhi kah sakate hai
 Also gather input about the study material
 online kaa jamanatechnology ke aane se koching kaa seen badal rahaa he
 In this digital phase, not everyone needs to go away from their home and take coaching in Kota
 kai koching centre online tutorial ke jariye bacchon ko ghar baithe hi jaruri study material or madad muhaiyaa karaane kaa kaam rahe hai
 You can also ask questions online and know the solution to your problem in a pinch
 yah claces bhi regular koching kii tarah hi hoti hai
 Personality Development: Many institutes have an interview or GD after passing the entrance test, so coaching centers can help in personality development
 yah baat beshak bade shaharon ke bacchon par lagu na ho lekin chote shaharon ke students ke liye to kaaphi madadgaar hoti he
 Here, students are given the opportunity to say their words effectively
 is tarah kii practice se students khud ko achche se pregent kar sakate hai

 One of these absentee candidates was Mahatma Gandhi
 shiksha vibhaag ne is centre ke liye jo raul number die the, unamem 3710502254 mahatma gandhi ke naam tha
 The funny thing is that the name of Mahatma Gandhi's father, Karamchand Gandhi, is the candidate of this roll number
 yah parikshaarthi anusuchit janajati kaa he or dwitiya bhashaa ke rup main sanskrit or vigyaan vishay varg le rakhaa he
 The most unique thing is that instead of the photo of the candidate, there is also a photo of the Father of the Nation, Mahatma Gandhi
 college ke principal avadhesh kumaar singh ne bataaya ki is raul number ke ummidavaar mahatma gandhi ko mahatma gandhi college centre dwaara records main anupasthit kar diya gaya he
 What would be more insulting to the education department's system that not only the mischievous elements applied, but the photo of the Father of the Nation Mahatma Gandhi was also posted in the application
 had to tab ho gai jab vibhaag bhi is puri prakriya main jaise aankh band kiye rahaa or rashtrapita ko parikshaarthi bana kar unka apmaan karne main koi sankoch nahin kiya

 In both houses of parliament, the ruling and opposition were face to face on Wednesday
 saare bavaal ke centre main pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa vah bayaan tha, jo unhone gujarat ke chunaav main diya tha
 PM Modi's allegations of conspiracy with Pakistan on former Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh are not giving up the central government's chase even in winter session
 gauratlab he ki buudhvaar ke din pradhanmantri loksabhaa main rahete hai
 This is the reason that Congress leaders reached the House with full plan
 piem modi ke sadan main pravesh karte hi, congress kheme main harakat tej ho gai
 The proceedings of the house started within seconds of Congress mps coming from their seats towards Vail
 magar unako andaaza nahin tha ki loksabhaa spikar sumitra mahajan unase bhi zyaada alert mod par thim
 He adjourned the house for 1 hour and with this, the Congress party had a chance to encircle the PM
 isi bich rajya sabha me alag tasviir thi
 The former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was sitting hurt over this matter and Congress MP was making a noise
 'piem maafee maango, piem sadan main aao' ke naare laga rahe saansad josh main the
 Some back benchers were moving here and there to see if there was a hint of going into the well

 ' is par bhi jab baat nahin bani to sabhapati ne house 45 minute ke liye sthagit kiya
 But on returning, the Chairman looked like the strict principal who wants to see discipline in the class
 yahi vajah he ki 12 baje jab kaarywahi shuru hui to chhutate hi venkaiya naidu ne saaf kar diya ki piem ne yah bayaan sadan main nahin diya he, aise main unka yahaan is par safai yaa maafee maangane kaa sawaal nahin uthta
 Even though the central government has kept away the clouds of trouble on Wednesday, the ministers of the government also know that there is a thaw between the two in this matter
 ek taraf congress kheme main is baat ko lekar do raay nahin he ki vah is masale par pradhanmantri se hi safai chaahate hai
 Actually, Dr
 Manmohan Singh is deeply hurt by the pm's statement
 amuman shant swabhaav kemanmohanis masale par piem ke bayaan par apni pratikriya de chuke hai
 If Congress sources are to be believed, he himself is adamant that the Prime Minister should clarify on this issue
 sarkaar kii taraf se jetali ne netaa vipakshgulam nabi azaadase mulaakaat kar maamle ko sulajhane kii koshish kii, par piem ke alaava congress or kisi se safai nahin chaahati
 In such a situation, this noose in the house is not going to end yet

 club) on Dec 11, 2017 at 10:47pm PST a new government has been formed in Pakistan and political rhetoric about relations with India has also intensified
 pakistani videsh mantri shah mahmud kuraishi kaa daawa he ki bharat ke pradhanmantri narendra modi ne imran khan se baatcheet kii peshkash kii he
 Meanwhile, Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar has also given a statement regarding relations with Pakistan
 ayyar ne kaha he kipakistanke saath baatcheet shuru honi chahie
 He said that we have to take this kind of risk
 congress netaa ne kaha ki pakistan main jo imran khan kii aguwai main nai sarkaar bani he, vah loktantric tareeke se bani he
 On the Pakistani Foreign Minister's statement, he said that he is my close friend
 lekin mujhe lagata he ki dilli main baithi hui modi sarkaar kisi tarah kaa faisla legi
 Because the government is in its last year
 congress netaa ne kaha ki agle saal jo nai sarkaar aegi, mujhe ummid he ki vah pakistan ke saath baatcheet kii pahal karegi
 Let me tell you that Congress President Rahul Gandhi has canceled the suspension from former Union Minister Mani Shankar Aiyarka Party with immediate effect
 pichley saal gujarat vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan pradhanmantri narendra modi ko 'neech kism kaa aadmi' vaali vivaadit tippanee karne kii vajah se ayyar ko party se nilambit kar diya gaya tha
 Former Indian captain Rahul Dravid has favored the cricket series between India and Pakistan only for the game of cricket
 dravid ne kaha, 'keval is khel ke lihaaz se bolen to bharat or pakistan ke bich cricket series kaa kisi bhi din swaagat kiya ja saktaa he
 ' lekin unhone usee saans main ye bhi kaha ki ye series sirf cricket tak simit nahin balki isamen suraksha or raajnneetik masalon ke shaamil hone kii vajah se iskaa faisalaa donon cricket board par hi chhod dena chahie
 There are many questions about the indo-pak cricket series, but it is also clear that the BCCI is also intensifying efforts to organize this series
 bisisiai ke sachiv anuraag thakur ne chandigarh main ek press kanference main bataaya ki is series ko lekar aanevaale hafton main bhi baaten ho sakati hai
 He also said that the matter has only happened between the two boards
 sarkaar ke str par abhi ise lekar koi baat nahin hui he
 The comments pakistan cricket board ke adhyaksh shehryaar khan or jagmohan daalamia kii mulaaqaat ke baad se cricket kii sabase badi series ke aayojan ko hone ko lekar sargarmi tej hoti ja rahi he
 a series of 3 Tests, 5 odis and 2 T20s were proposed in December at the joint press conference of Shaharyar Khan and Jagmohan Dalmiya in Kolkata
 lekin is series ke prastaav ke aate hi vivaad bhi khadey ho gaye or ye lazimi bhi tha
 Anurag Thakur, secretary of BCCI and BJP MP from Hamirpur, is cautiously pointing out that this series is possible, but the government has not made up its mind yet
 darasal baat sarkaar tak yojana banaakar pahunchaai hi nahin gai he
 He says that the conversation is currently at the level of two boards and that too in the initial stages
 isliye filhal itnaa hi ishaara samajhnaa chahie ki is series ke hona yaa nahin hone ke bich ek lanbaa rasta baaqi he
 But he also said in the same breath that this series is not just limited to cricket but because of the security and political issues involved in it, the decision should be left on both the cricket boards
 bharat-paak cricket series ko lekar chaahe kai sawaal barqaraar hon lekin ye ishaara bhi saafe ho rahaa he ki is series ke aayojan ke liye bisisiai bhi koshishen tej kar rahaa he
 BCCI secretary Anurag Thakur told a press conference in Chandigarh that there could be talks in the weeks leading up to the series
 unhone ye bhi kaha ki baat filhal do board ke bich hi hui he
 There is no talk about it at the government level
 tippaniyan Since the meeting of Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Shaharyar Khan and Jagmohan Dalmiya, the movement for the hosting of the biggest series of cricket is increasing
 kolkata main shehryaar khan or jagmohan daalamia kii sanyukt press kanference main disambar main 3 test, 5 vanade or 2 tii20 kii series kaa prastaav rakhaa gaya

 a series of 3 Tests, 5 odis and 2 T20s were proposed in December at the joint press conference of Shaharyar Khan and Jagmohan Dalmiya in Kolkata

 Rail services have been stopped due to continuous violence in the Kashmir Valley
 duusare rajyon se aae railway karmchaaree stesan chhodkar bhaagane lage hai, lihaaja railway ko sabhi sevaayen band kerani padi he
 According to the employees and their families, the condition of Kashmir is not such that it can be worked or lived there
 log vahaan par khaane pine tak kii samasya se jujh rahe hai
 In such a situation, except leaving Kashmir, there is no other way left for these employees
 kashmir chhodkar aaye ye karmchaaree uttar pradesh, bihar or dilli se hai or apane gharon ko ravaanaa ho rahe hai
 Even after the month of June has passed, North India, including the national capital New Delhi, is waiting for heavy rains, while the lack of monsoon is also increasing the heat and heat
 vahiin duusari ore aarthik rajdhani mumbai or uske aasapaas ke ilaakon main musaladhar barish ho rahi he, jisase ab tak 16 se zyada logon kii maut ho chuki he
 Jhajjam rain has brought Mumbai to a standstill, water has been flooded at various places, trains have been affected due to flooding of railway tracks
 ek ore sookhaa to duusari ore barish
 If there is no rain in time, a drought situation occurs
 barish adhik ho or phir sookhe kii sthiti donon hi sthiti main sabase zyada asar kheti par padataa he
 This situation is not correct in both the cases
 insaanon ke saath-saath pashu-pakshiyon ko mushkilon kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 Every year, due to drought and its severe heat and flood, the country suffers huge loss of public money
 in 2 prakritik aapadaaon kii vajah se aazaadee ke baad se hi na sirf lakhon kii sankhya main log maare gaye balki kai lakh karod rupye kaa nuksaan bhi desh ko uthaanaa padaa he
 Loss of Rs 3 lakh crore may be waiting for rain in North India, but when it starts, the devastation associated with it leaves behind all kinds of destruction
 baari barish se har saal mumbai ke alaava bihar, uttar pradesh, madhya pradesh or purvottar bharat samet kai rajya prabhavit hote hai
 Every year during and after the catastrophe, there are fierce discussions and debates on how to avoid it, but it is forgotten as time passes
 is baar bhi baadh se bachane ko lekar koi thos kadam nahin uthaae gaye hai
 On a question related to rain and floods in the Rajya Sabha in March last year, Union Minister of State for Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation Arjun Ram Meghwal said that from 1953 to 2017, due to rain and floods, the country has 3 lakh 65 There was a loss of Rs 860 crore
 1 lakh se zyada log (1,07,487) baadh or barish kii bhent chadh gaye
 The largest disaster in 1977 said that in the devastation caused by heavy rains and floods between 1953 and 2017, a total of 1,07,487 people died in these 64 years
 jan haani ke aadhaar par 1977 main ai prakritik aapadaa sabase vinaashkari thi kyonki is saal sabase zyada 11,316 logon ne apni jaan ganvaa di thi
 The second biggest disaster came in 1988, 11 years after the 1977 disaster, in which 4,252 people died
 beete 64 saalon main 6 baar baadh ke kaaran 3 hajaar se zyada logon kii maut hui
 According to statistics presented by the government, in 1953 the flood disaster killed the lowest 37 people
 iske baad 1965 main 79 logon kii maut hui
 There is no reduction in deaths due to floods and heavy rains every year
 har saal 1700 kii jaati he jaan1976 se lekar 2017 tak har saal (1999 main 745 or 2012 main 933 mauton ko chhodkar) is prakritik vipadaa se marane waalon kii sankhya 1 hajaar se zyada hi rahi he
 On an average, 1,654 people fall prey to water disaster every year
 jal sambandhi aapadaa se agar fasal, ghar or saarvajanik sampatti ke nuksaan hone kii baat karen to beete 64 saalon main 3,65,860 karod rupye kaa nuksaan hua
 The year 2013 and 2015 proved to be the most devastating years
 2013 main uttarakhand main musaladhar barish ne apni vinashlila dikhaai jisamen 36937
 843 crores rupees public property due to rain
 jabaki saarvajanik sampatti ke saath-saath fasal or makaan ko hue nuksaan kaa akalan karne par yah nuksaan 47348
 751 crores was up to Rs
 fasal or makaan ko baari nuksaan2 saal baad 2015 main ai prakritik aapadaa se fasal or makaan ke saath-saath saarvajanik sampatti (32,200
 182 crores), which was the biggest loss in the last 64 years
 is saal 57291
 099 crore died in this disaster
 har saal ausatan jaan ke alaava sampatti ke rup main 5628
 628 crores gets washed away in water, but the administration promises to improve it every year which are only verbal promises
 duusari ore baadh se fasal or makaanon ko sabase kam nuksaan 1965 main hua or us saal 7
 Property worth Rs 135 crores was ruined
 1967 se har saal 150 karod se zyada kaa nuksaan hua jo saal dar saal badhata hi chalaa gaya or 1977 main yah nuksaan pehali baar hajaar karod ke aankade ko paar kar gaya
 In the 9 years of severe heat, the death of 6100 people causes disastrous disaster
 2010 se lekar 2018 tak sookhe kii vajah se 6,100 se zyada logon kii jaan ja chuki he, jisamen 2015 main sabase zyada mautein darj kii gai or yah is dauraan hui kul mauton kaa ek tihaai he
 During this period, the people most affected by the drought were from Andhra Pradesh
 sansad main die gaye ek jawaab ke anusaar, 2015 main garmi or lu kii vajah se 2081 log maare gaye
 In undivided Andhra Pradesh in 2081 alone 1,422 people died
 haalanki bheeshan garmi ke kaaran hone vaali mauton kii sankhya main kami zarur ai
 700 people died in 2016 and 20 in 2018
 2010 main garmi kii vajah se 269 log maare gaye
 Thousands of people die every year due to natural disasters in the country
 baadh kii tabaahi se jaan-maal kaa baari nuksaan hota hi he, saath rajasav ko nuksaan pahunchataa he
 At the same time, people have to suffer a lot due to drought and heat
 pichley ek dashak main bheeshan garmi ne dharti ko behad garm kar diya he or ab kai jagahon par taapmaana 45 degree celsius ke kareeb rahata he, lekin ham paryaavaran ko sudhaarney kii koshish karne kii baat karte hai par hakeekat main koi sudhaar nahin hota
 Many states including Bihar, Northeast and UP are affected every year due to the floods, but till date we could not achieve any concrete progress
 abhi ham barish kaa intjaar kar rahe hai, lekin jab ek baar yah shuru ho jaaegi to har jagah baadh se ghar dhahne, fasalon ke barbaad hone or logon ke maare jane kii khabaron kaa saamana karnaa shuru kar denge

 Assembly elections are due in Maharashtra in the next few months
 loksabhaa chunaavon main mili safalataa se bhartiya janata party or shivasena donon partiyon kaa hausala buland he
 The manner in which the leaders of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) are breaking down and joining the BJP has increased the confidence of Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis
 lekin iske baavjood vah chunaav main apni party ko jhatka lagane kii koi gunjaaish chhodana nahin chaahate
 In view of preparations for the upcoming assembly elections, where Shiv Sena's youth army chief Aditya Thackeray is taking out a 'jan Ashirwad' Yatra in Maharashtra, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis is starting a 'maha Mandate' Yatra from August 1
 amit shah 1 agast ko fadanvis kii 'maha janadesh yatra' ko hari jhandi dikhaaenge
 At the same time, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will attend the concluding program of the yatra
 party sutron ke mutabik fadanvis amravati jile main gurukunj mojari se maha janadesh yatra shuru karenge
 The Chief Minister's visit will be in two phases that will cover the entire state
 bijepi kii yojana ke mutabik is dauraan mukhyamantri 104 reliyon, 228 swaagat sabhaaon or 20 samvaadadaata sammelnon ko sambodhit karenge
 During the visit, Fadnavis will visit all the state assemblies
 bijepi ne 'phir ek baar shivashahee sarkaar' or 'abaki baar 220' ke paar kaa naaraa buland kiya he
 Fadnavis will hear gill-shikwe Vidhan Sabha and Lok Sabha elections are fought on different patterns and are won
 log matdaan ke samay vidhansabha or loksabhaa chunaav ko alag-alag nazariye se dekhte hai
 Therefore, Fadnavis does not want to leave any scope for his side so that the voter who has been with the BJP in the Lok Sabha should choose a different route in the assembly elections
 asal main, pichley paanch varshon main fadanvis ko kai morchon par jujhna padaa he
 The Maratha Reservation Movement, the Dalit community's agitation about Bhima Koregaon, the farmers' padyatra, conditions like floods caused by heavy rains in Mumbai and drought-stricken farmers in some parts of the state are some of the issues on which the BJP government in Maharashtra faces challenges
 Have had to do
 apni yatra main sabhi vidhansabha siton ko cover ke peeche yahi makasad sabase milakar unke gil-shikave sune jaaen
 The bjp-shiv Sena alliance in Maharashtra is aligned with the Shiv Sena
 bijepi-shivasena milakar chunaav ladane vaale hai lekin shivasena ne saaf kar diya he ki uski najar mukhyamantri kii kursi par he
 Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray's son Aditya, however, has not said anything clearly on his candidature for the post of Chief Minister
 magar yah jarur kaha he ki yah janata ko tay karnaa he ki unhen pad par baithne ke liye taiyaar hona he yaa nahin
 i cannot talk about it because it is the only thing that is not in my hands
 aditya ne aage kaha ki shivasena ne jo vaade kiye hai unhen puraa karnaa mere haath main he
 This time it is believed that if his government comes, both the parties will take charge of the Chief Minister's chair for two-and-a-half years
 shivasena lagaataar apni manshaa ko jaahir kar rahi he
 In such a situation, it is also necessary for Fadnavis to keep pace with the Shiv Sena
 shatabdi express main chaay ke cap paranarendra modi or amit shaahaki photo se vivaad khadaa ho gaya he
 In fact, in the train going from Delhi to Amritsar in the past, the paper cup in which tea was served to the passengers, a picture of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Amit Shah was printed on it
 bhartiya railway ne maamle main jaanch ke aadesh die hai
 Neeraj Kumar, chief public relations officer of Northern Railway, says, "at first, it seems that it happened by mistake
 lekin maamle kii abhi jaanch chal rahi he
 If it is proved that this has been done intentionally, action will be taken against the guilty
 'niraj ne aage kaha ki aisa lagata he jaise galati se jo cap bijepi kaaryakartaaon ke liye istemaal kiye jane the, vah yatriyon ke paas pahunch gaye
 Congress leader Virender Sharma said that it seems as if the Prime Minister is more interested in taking photographs

 punjab ke paanch alag-alag kisaanon kii kahani ek jaisi he or us kahani kaa dukhad ant bhi ek jaisaa hi he
 These are the unfortunate 5 farmers of Punjab who have given their lives in the last 24 hours
 punjab ke bhatinda ke chaar or sangrur ke ek kisaan ne pichley 24 ghante main karj ke boj ke chalate aatmahatya karke apni jivan-lila samaapt kar lee
 This is the situation in the state where the ministers of the state government do programs on government expenditure and distribute loan waiver checks to the farmers, but the claims of these programs and the claims of the Punjab government revealed the suicide of 5 farmers in 24 hours
 Have kept it bathinda jile ke gaanv shraddha ke kisaan paramjeet singh ke paas 4 acre jameen thi, lekin bank kaa karj 5 se 6 lakh rupee tak pahunch gaya tha jiske chalate unhone aatmahatya kar lee

 un par 6 se 7 lakh rupee kaa karj tha
 The third incident is of the village Dhinger, where the farmer Jograj Singh, who owned 2 acres of land and had a loan of Rs 3 lakh

 Do you hear? Come down brother ”purvi bihar ke bhagalpur main umas bharaa din
 1 in the afternoon 35 baje hai or pradhanmantri narendra modi tay samay se do ghante kii deree se yahaan pahunche hai
 But there is huge enthusiasm in the crowd
 modi ko dekhne ke liye kuch yuva bans kii un balliyon par chadh gaye, jin par manch kaa tent tikaa he
 Seeing this, Modi urged those youths, “you hear me? Come down ” bhagalpur ke aam taur par kam istemaal hone vaale airbase par 1 sitambar ko yojit is raily main logon kaa hujum umada hua tha
 Modi may not have fulfilled his election promises
 virodhiyon kaa to kahana he ki ek bhi vaada puraa nahin kiya
 But the special relationship he has established with the people at the grassroots level is as important as his hitech machinery which has the responsibility of carrying his message across the shoulders of Bihar
 bijepi ke ahm chehre modi ek baar phir vahi kar rahe the jo ve pichley kuch saal se karte aa rahe hai&chunaav kaa agenda or charchaa kaa vishay tay karnaa, chaahe vah rajnatik ho yaa vyaktigat
 He has held four "parivartan" rallies in Bihar in the last five weeks
 unki pehali raily 25 july ko mujffarpur main hui thi or har raily pichhali raily se kahin badi thi
 Through all these, he again managed to center the entire election around him
 isamen unki uplabdhiyaan, unki kathith asafalataaen, unka sushasan kaa model or vikaas kaa agenda shaamil he
 Despite his unfulfilled promises, he has once again managed to get his popularity stamped and has become the face of the party's campaign to win the BJP in Bihar on its own
 saaf he ki narendra modi ne bihar chunaav kaa agenda kaayade se tay kar diya he
 The guerrilla style in which they are holding their election meetings is a testimony to their well-planned strategy
 apane virodhiyon ko ve ek mudda dete hai or turant agali sabha main doosraa mudda oochaal dete hai
 Because of this, their opponents do not have a chance to answer
 ve ek kaa jawaab dete hai to doosraa mudda uchhal aata he
 After the rally in Bhagalpur, it became clear that Modi's strategy of "run and Run" is very well thought out
 modi ne bihar main apane prachaar abhiyaan kii shuruyaat main apane do siyaasi pratidwandviyon, jedy(you) ke nitish kumaar or argedy ke lalu prasad yadav par sidhe hamalaa bolaa or unke virodhabhaason ko 9 agast ko mujffarpur or gaya kii do sabhaaon main ujagar kiya
 As Lalu and Nitish began to respond in their style, Modi overturned the entire debate, giving Bihar Rs 1
25 lakh crore at its third meeting in Ara on August 18
 ke vikaas package kii ghoshnaa kar di
 That is, he refused to get involved in a charge-and-fight battle
 bijepi ke liye khush hone kii vajah yah he ki unke virdohi har baar unke uksaave main aakar galtiyaan kar rahe the
 On the other hand, Nitish Kumar has a bigger stake than Lalu, so in response to the Prime Minister's package, Nitish issued full page advertisements in newspapers for government expenditure and 2 in his behalf for the development of Bihar in return for the Prime Minister's special package
 7 lakh karod ru
 Announced the package of
 unhone shaayad sochaa hoga ki modi is par unase bahes main ulajhenge lekin isse ulat modi ne is package kaa swaagat karte hue kaha, “yah acchhee baat he ki vikaas ab chunavi mudda ban gaya he
 "clearly, his idea was to send a message to the people that it is Modi who has forced his opponents to focus on development
 haalanki modi bataur pradhanmantri apane kaamkaaj se jude sawaalon ko badi chaalaaki se nazarandaaj kar gaye, unhen yah bakhubi ehsaas he ki pichley 14 maheenon main unka report card utana chamakdaar nahin he jaisaa ki pichley aam chunaavon ke pehle gujarat kaa mukhyamantri rahete vakt hua karata tha
 Modi also knows that he can ignore all the attacks on him, but he will have to calm down his criticisms on the issue of functioning
 unhone bhagalpur kii raily main bilkul yahi kiya
 He said that he will give an account of his work at the time of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, but "this opportunity is for him (lalu and Nitish) to account for his 25 years of rule
" unhone is dauraan kya kiya, yah bataane ke badale ve donon milakar sirf modi, modi kiye ja rahe hai
 Putting Nitish and Lalu together and asking them for 25 years of account is also part of a well-planned strategy
 isamen jaan-boojhkar is tathy ko bhula diya gaya he ki in varshon ke dauraan aath saal tak bijepi khud nitish sarkaar kaa hissaa rahi thi
 BJP understands that Nitish cannot be challenged on the issue of development as he has done something in Bihar
 bijepi ke ek varisht netaa kehete hai, “maamla saaf he
 Nitish hopes to get the benefit of Lalu Prasad's vote bank, then he will also have to become a part of Lalu's misrule
 donon hi jangalraj kii viraasat se pallaa nahin jhaad sakate
 "nitish Kumar has not yet responded to Lalu Prasad's 15-year misrule but the BJP has decided that it will ask him this question continuously
" modi ek or purana nuskhaa aajamaa rahe haih agar aap unhen haraa nahin sakate, to unhen nazarandaaj kar dijie
 At a joint rally of Sonia Gandhi, Nitish and Lalu on 30 August at the historic Gandhi Maidan in Patna, Modi was fiercely targeted
 unke “56 inch ke seene” vaale bayaan par sonia gandhi ne poocha, “modi ne shobaaji (nautanki) ke alaava kiya hi kya he?” to nitish ne kaha, “bihariyon ke diene ko chunauti dene vaala vah shaks he jiske purvajon kii swatantraaa sangram main dur-dur tak koi bhoomika nahin thi
 Lalu while mocking his racist appeal while speaking a personal attack, but Modi ignored all these comments
 is tarah modi aisi baton se upar uthakar ek badi shakhsiyat ke rup main logon ke bich khud ko sthapit karne kii koshish kar rahe hai
 He corrected his mistake of directly naming the charges which had fallen heavily on him in Delhi and his rival Arvind Kejriwal got the benefit here
 iske vipareet 25 july ko jab modi ne apni raily main “doston kii peeth main chura ghonpane ke kaaran” pradesh ke mukhyamantri ke diene par sawaal uthaaya tha to nitish ne unhen “apane shabd waapas lene” ke liye majaboor karne ke liye abhiyaan chalaaya
 He asked JD (U) workers to take samples of nail and hair of five crore Biharis who could be sent to the Prime Minister's Office for DNA test
 pradhanmantri ke adhure vaadon kii yaad dilaane ke liye nitish kumaar ne apni jansabhaon main modi ke loksabhaa chunaav prachaar ke dauraan die gaye bhaashanon kaa record bhi bajaayaa lekin ve modi ko in par jawaab dene ke liye ab tak uksaa nahin paae hai
 a Bihar BJP leader says, "we are campaigning for voters, not for Nitish and Lalu
 unke aaropon kaa jawaab nahin dekar hamane unase chunaav kaa agenda tay karne kaa mauka chin liya he or unhen hataash kar diya he
 "in fact, Modi has given alliances to allies Ram Vilas Paswan, Jeetan Ram Manjhi and Upendra Kushwaha to play the caste card, but are working themselves above the caste to woo women and young people, among whom the elders of their loved ones Number is in Bihar
 bihar kaa chunaav bahut nirnaayak he
 bjp's good performance here will wash away the stains of Delhi
 isse kahin zyada ahm yah he ki isse bihar ke purab main pashchim bengal or pashchim main uttar pradesh main hone vaale agle chunaavon ke liye bhi prishthbhumi taiyaar hogi
 Assembly elections are due in 2017 in both states
 nitish ke liye is chunaav main karo yaa maro kii sthiti he
 For Modi, it is a question of his credibility, which will increase if he wins, but if he loses, it is possible that the youth of Bhagalpur will not have to bear the brunt to get a glimpse of Modi, at least not in the near future

 apni kami ko chhipaane ke liye sarkaar ke kuch log afasaron ko nishaanaa bana rahe hai
 Now my children and relatives are also looking at me with suspicion
 rajya main iees association mritpraaya he, aise main mukhya sachiv kii chuppi afasaron kaa manobal gira rahi he
 "this comment of an IAS officer of the rank of IAS officer posted in Uttar Pradesh Secretariat on Chief Secretary Javed Usmani is enough to state that even after the formation of the new government, the head of the bureaucracy in the state could not maintain the Iqbal that he hoped Was going aakhir mukhya sachiv ke pad se apekshaayen kyon thim? is sawaal kaa jawaab jaanane ke liye thodaa peeche chalanaa hoga
 During the last five years, during Mayawati's tenure, the Chief Secretary was made like Babu, while she was the largest institution of state bureaucracy
 mayawati ne apane shasankaal main sari naukarshahi ke upar cabinet sachiv kaa pad banaaya or us par apane pasandida gaiyr iees afasar or pilot shashaank shekhar singh ko baitha diya
 At that time, the job of the Chief Secretary was only to serve the orders of the Cabinet Secretary sitting on the fifth floor (the nickname of the Chief Minister's office on the fifth floor of the Secretariat)
 nizaam badalte hi mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ne cabinet sachiv ke pad ko samaapt kar diya or mukhya sachiv ko naukarshahi kaa mukhiya bana diya
 Akhilesh, playing the Muslim card, appointed Javed Usmani, a 1978 batch IAS officer posted on deputation at the center, as the new chief secretary, who had served as secretary and principal secretary in Mulayam Singh's previous SP government
 osmani kii tainaati ke do hafte baad hi nitigat evam ahm padon par niyukti ke maamalon main pancham tal or mukhya sachiv karyaalay main takaraav shuru ho gaya or isi takaraav ke chalate pramukh sachiv str par hui kai niyuktiyon main tainaati ke turant baad pherbadal karnaa padaa
 Now the situation is that retired IAS officers close to Mulayam Singh in the state are directly and indirectly effective on bureaucracy and the Chief Secretary is not getting a chance to work openly
 vipakshi dal bispi ke rashtriya mahasachiv or vidhanparishad main party ke netaa nasimuddin siddiki kehete hai, ''sapa sarkaar main afasar belgaum hai
 Just as there are not one but 3-4 Chief Ministers in the government, similarly there are two to three Chief Secretaries in the bureaucracy
 osmani ko mukhya sachiv banaakar sapa sarkaar ne keval musalamaanon ko lubhaane kii koshish kii he jo kaamyaab nahin hone vaali he
 "looks like Usmani also has no interest in continuing as Chief Secretary and may be back soon
" aalochanaon se beparwaah osmani mukhyamantri kii mahatvakankshi yojanaon jaise berogari bhatta yaa chaatro ko laptop baantne kii yojana kii nigaraanee kar rahe hai
 After becoming the Chief Secretary, Javed Usmani spends most of his time in meetings and settling files in his office
 pichhali sapa sarkaar main mukhya sachiv rahe akhand pratap singh or naveen chandra vaajapeyi har cabinet baithak ke baad uske nirnyon kii jaankaree media ko dete the lekin osmani ne is parampara ko viraam laga diya he
 Political analyst Surendra Singh says, "usmani has mostly been posted in the PMO during the last 20 years and this has dominated the work culture of the meetings
" agar ve daftar main baithkar keval file hi peetate rahenge to rajya kii jameen hakeekat se vaasta nahin rakh paaenge
 Which will not be beneficial for the government

 For this purpose, the central government started the UPI payment service last year
 isaki madad se do bainko ke bich ap ke jariye paise kaa lene dein kiya ja saktaa he
 Keeping this in mind, many banks have also started their own UPI app, so that payments can be made for free
 lekin ab khabar mili he ki 10 july se UPI se bhugtan main paise dene honge
 According to the news of Gadgets 360, HDFC Bank has sent an e-mail to some customers, stating that there will be a fee for payment from UPI from July 10
 reports ke mutabik, 1 se 25,000 rupee tak ke pement ke liye 3 rupee (tex atirikt) kaa shulk lagegaa, vahiin 25,001 se 100,000 lakh rupee tak ke bhugtan ke liye 5 rupee (atirikt shulk) kaa shulk vasula jayega
 Since this mail has been sent by HDFC Bank, it is not clear that only HDFC Bank will charge these charges or the rest of the banks will do the same
 lekin agar sabhi bainko ke len-dein main shulk vasula jane laga to log phir se nakadi kii ore bhaagane lagenge
 Gadget 360 received a mail from NPCI Chief Operating Officer Dilip Asbe, he wrote, "we have provided United Payments Interface to every bank
" abhi tak kisi bank dwaara upiai pement par shulk lagaae jane kii jaankaree nahin he
 But banks can charge for UPI transactions between two account holders if they want
 lekin dukaanon main is plateform ke zarie bhugtan karne par koi atirikt shulk nahin lagegaa
 It is clearly written in the guidelines of NPCI

 He took renunciation seven times and ruled seven times

 itihaas, janashruti, shodh aadi ko khangalate hue kathakaar mahesh kataare ne ek clasik rachaa he, upanyaas kamini kaay kantare kii shakl main
 The most important thing in the novel is its language, its fluency, which brings alive the times of Bhartrihari
 parivesh kaa aisa nirmaan ki bhashaa se chitramay prastuti ho
 The novel in two parts discharges the qualities, qualities of the king of Bhartrihari, householder, lover, husband, poet, yogi etc
 in such a way that the characters of the novel have complete hold over the writer and the Bhatrihari, who have been the test of time, are human Faced with perfection and flaws, they come to the fore
 upanyaas kahin-kahin is tarah se bhi apane samay ko chitrit karata he ki usamen hamaara apana samay bhi jhankane lagata he
 Even at that time there was a difference between the superior class and the general public, areas far away from metros, capitals were the same as today

 is upanyaas main bhartruhari ke saath-saath antarkthaayen bhi chalati hai jaise kiraal katha, urvashi-pururava kii katha, guru gorakhnath janm katha aadi
 This novel not only enriches Hindi literature, but also hoists its flag by standing on the side of man and labor
 sampurna upanyaas main unke aise prasang hai jab vaibhav, dhan, upabhoktavaad ke barakes upanyaaskaar ne shram ko, manushyata ko pratishthit kiya he or yah sapreyas nahin lagata
 Wherever it is weakened, it underlines it
 bhartruhari jab tak raja rahe jan se dur rahe, jab swayan chalakar jan ke paas aae to lok-maanas main, loakgeet main bas gaye

 film ne do hafte main 190 karod kii kamai ke saath tamaam trade exparts ko chaunkaa diya he
 The credit for the film's success is being given to the story and the star cast
 jaahir si baat he ki film kii saxes main donon kaa bada haath he
 Decoding the success of the film, the subject of the film, the theme love story is the biggest reason for the success
 bollywood kaa itihaas gavaah he ki jab bhi hindi cinema main lav story besd filmein bani hai unhen darshakon kaa bharpoor pyaar mila he
 Hundreds of films such as mughal-e-azam Ho in 1960, Pyaasa in 1957, Sometime in 1976, i Love in 1989, Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge in 1995 are witness to this
 haalanki bollywood kii tamaam prem kahaniyaan pyaar ke positive said ko dikhaati hai
 However, there are many love stories such as Darr, Anjam and Tere Naam which show passion of love and a different kind of negativity
 sidhi bhashaa main samajhaayaa jaae to bollywood filmon main do tarah ke aashiq najar aate hai
 One who knows how to sacrifice in love

 In Kabir Singh, Kabir is in love with Preeti Sikka, whom he calls his captive
 uskaa khyaal rakhane ke liye college ke rule tod detaa he
 Beats people like animals
 jab baari shaadi kii aati he to vahaan bhi pyaar paane ke liye duniya jahaan se lard padataa he
 When it is learned that Preeti is married, she is about to become a mother, yet she just wants Preeti

 logon ko chaunkna nahin chahie
 The film also has the potential to cross the 300 million mark at the box office
 aaj kaa yuva kabir singh main apana aksh dekh rahaa he
 The strong collection of the film everyday is a testimony to this fact
 film kaa naam :trapddiarector:vikramaditya motavanistar cast:rajkumaar raav, gitanjali thapivadhi:1 ghanta 42 minutesrtificate:u / aretimga:3
 5 Stardirector Vikramaditya Motwani has directed the best films like 'lootera' and 'udaan' as well as produced many films under the banner of 'phantom' and now once again Vikramaditya has worked on different types of subjects
 In which he has taken one of the best actors, Rajkumar Rao, how is this film made, i review to find out
 kahaneeyah kahanemumbai ke rahane vaale bachaler shaury (rajkumaar raav)kii he jo ek offis main kaam karata he or offis kii ladki nuri (gitanjali thapa) ke saath jindagi gujaarne ke liye apane bachaler pad ko chhodkar nayaa ghar lene kii talash main nikalataa he lekin wo nae ghar ke chakkar main funs jaataa he
 In a building being built, the broker gives him the house by bluffing and then the story starts
 ek aisa ghar jahaan naa pani he or naa hi bijli, aise main shaury kaise us imaarat se baahar nikalne kii jugat ladaata he, ye pataa karne ke liye aapako film dekhni padegi
 Know why you can watch the film, Rajkummar Rao's best performance makes you think about that character in every moment and you can connect with the emotions going on inside him
 102 minute tak ek hi actor ko aap agar screen par dekhte rah jate hai to kahin naa kahin boriyat bhi hoti he lekin rajkumaar ne apni parformons ke hisaab se adbhut kaam kiya he jo aapako baandhe rakhata he or sochane par vivash bhi karata he
 - The plot of the film has been kept very simple, which is seen to be free flow
 -bevajaah ke gaanon se mukt he yah film, jisaki vajah se aapako dekhte vakt koi bhi aadchan najar nahin aati, yaa phir aap kisi anachaahe brake par theatre ke baahar nahin jate
 - The film has been released without interval, due to which you remain in the zone of the story
 -film kicinemetography acchhee haior saath hi lokation kamaal kii he
 -when watching the film, it is believed that how much Lamarck and Darwin's law taught in science is correct
 kamjor kadiyanfilm kii kamjor kadi isaki raftar he jise or choti kii ja sakati thi, saath hi isamen kuch lambey lambey seen hai jo film festivels ke hisaab se to thik hai lekin aajkal bhaag daudi ke jamaane kii janata shaayad jaldi vaala rigelt chaahati he, to film main zyada tehraav shaayad iskaa mines point ban jaae
 Like typical Hindi films, the characters are not overly decorated and are not spice, comedy or item numbers used in today's films, due to which perhaps a temperament may not be able to coincide with this film

 hameshaa kii tarah sania kii hajir javaabi ke aage ek baar phir kapil sharma ne haar maan lee
 It happened that as soon as Sania's entry in the show, Kapil welcomed it saying that Sania used to come earlier, we always waited

 So how does Sania feel like being a mother? On hearing this, Sania laughingly asked Kapil Sharma, when are you telling the good news

 During the chat show, Kapil Sharma asked Sania that now you are taking care of a child

 Senior BJP leader LK Advani alleged that the Congress-led UPA government is the most 'corrupt' and 'weak' government in the country so far
 adwani ne kannur vidhansabha seat se bhaajapa pratyaashee you tii jayanathan ke samarthan main yojit chunavi raily ko sambodhit karte hue aarope lagaaya ki samprag sarkaar bhrashtchaar main dubi hui he or vah desh kii ab tak kii sabase bhrasht or kamjor sarkaar he
 Giving examples of 2G spectrum, Commonwealth Games and Adarsh flat scams, he said that corruption cases are going to be exposed one after the other every day
 unhone is baat kaa bharosa jataayaa ki bhaajapa is baar kerala vidhansabha kaa pratinidhitiv karegi kyonki janata ldf or udief dono se tang aa chuki he
 He said that alternative governments of the CPI (M) -led LDF and UDF, formed with the support of the Congress, are responsible for lagging behind in the development and progress of the state
 unhone daawa kiya ki kerala ke logon ne tisare vikalp par vichaar karnaa shuru kar diya he
 Navjot Singh Sidhu is the leader who has made the most headlines in the 2017 Punjab Assembly elections so far
 63 varshiya siddhu kaa janm punjab ke patiala main hua tha or unke pita congressi the
 After breaking his old association with the BJP, with which party will Sidhu start his new political innings
 
 
 ye ek bada sawaal rahaa
 Earlier, it was believed that Sidhu would be seen standing with the Aam Aadmi Party in the Punjab Assembly elections, but for some reason he did not get along with AAP
 iske baad siddhu apni alag party banane kii jaddojahad main najar aae, lekin sari atakalon par viraam lagaate hue aakhirkaar unhone congress party ke saath apni nai raajnneetik pari kii shuruyaat kii
 Sidhu was a BJP MP from Amritsar seat in Punjab for 10 years, but in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the party fielded Arun Jaitley instead of him
 mana jaataa he siddhu or bhaajapa ke bich vivaad kaa silsilaa yaheen se shuru hua tha
 Let me tell you that before Sidhu, his wife Navjot Kaur Sidhu had broken ties with BJP and joined Congress
 haalanki vah 2017 ke punjab chunaav main kisi bhi seat se nahin lard rahi hai
 At the same time, Sidhu entered the electoral arena from Amritsar (east) constituency with a Congress ticket
 upi main haar ke baad samaajawaadee party phir sanbhal rahi he
 The new president is carrying on the party's tradition
 wo jald hi iftaar party dene ja rahe hai
 This will be his first iftar party as party president
 abhi tak mulaayam hi iftaar diya karte the
 Preparations are in full swing
 par sabase bada sawaal yah he ki chunaav ke dauraan paariwarik vivaad ke baad kya khud mulaayam akhilesh kii party main shaamil honge?mashhoor rahi he mulaayam kii iftaar partimulaayam ne 1992 main sapa kaa gathan kiya tha
 He then united the minorities of the state
 sapa kii sarkaar banane main upi ke yadavon ke baad muslim bahul voton kaa bahut bada yogadan rahaa he
 In such a situation, big and small are seen attending Mulayam's Iftar parties
 nahin shaamil honge shivpalamulaayam shaamil honge yaa nahin philhal party kaa koi netaa is bare main bolne ko taiyaar nahin he
 But it has become clear that Akhilesh Yadav's uncle i
e
 Shivpal Yadav is not reaching
 bataa den ki mulaayam philhal party ke sangrakshak he
 Shivpal has been angry since October last year
 mulaayam ke saamne akhilesh se manch par unka vaad-vivaad chunaav ke dauraan dekha ja chukaa he
 In such a situation, there was a possibility that he would hardly be seen in such a party with Akhilesh
 kisi hogi sapa kii iftaar party?lakhanu main party ke daftar par iftaar kii taiyaariyaan joro par he
 Large pandals are being set up, even large steel framing tents have been installed outside Kalidas Marg, so that thousands of people can attend it
 party ke sabase bade muslim chehre ajam khan se lekar kai chote-bade netaaon kii maujuudagi kii ummid kii ja rahi he
 Political politics was kept away from the party, Akhilesh Yadav has kept the Iftar party away from the political gathering
 yah iftaar sirf party ke logon ke liye rakhi gai he
 It did not invite people to any government post or constitutional post
 pehle bhi partiyaan is baat kaa khyaal rakhti hai kissanvaidhanik padon par baithe logon kopartiyon ko iftaar se dur rakhaa jaae
 Often, there is a strange combination of hope and despair in the leaders
 jab ve janata ke bich hote hai to aashaa se labarej dikhte hai, lekin apane nijee palon main niraashaa se ghire hote hai
 Whenever his status quo is challenged and he does not see a chance to be relieved by the words he utters, this sense of despair deepens
 isse congress bhi achhuti nahin he
 It is a new experience for his party that it is completely opposite to his own political past, giving the interview of his leader Rahul Gandhi in a new avatar and frequent visits to the public forums
 iskaa asar yah hua ki ve lagaataar surkhiyon main hai or soshal media main chhaae hai
 This exercise has given sleep to many people
 somvaar, 27 janvari ko prasaarit rahul gandhi ke tivi intervyuu ke bare main party kaa aadhikarik rukh yah he ki baatcheet ke dauraan unke netaa ne dil kii baaten saamne rakhkar bharti janata party (bijepi) ke pradhanmantri pad ke daavedaar narendra modi se sidhe mukaable kaa maahaul banaaya he
 This is a public ban, but in private the situation is completely opposite
 24, akbar road ke galiyaaron main ho rahi khusar-fusar niraashaa kii gaharaai lakiron ko beparda kar detii he
 An uncomfortable situation has arisen for the Congress, with Rahul believing that 'some Congressmen were possibly involved in the anti-sikh riots' that followed the 1984 murder of his grandmother
 vahiin, vipakshi partiyon main is baat ko bhunaane kii hode much gai
 On 29 January, BJP mlas staged a protest against the Congress in the capital
 usee din mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne aanan-fanan main dilli ke leftinent governor najeeb jang se mulaakaat kar sikh dangon kii jaanch ke liye vishesh jaanch dal (esaity) banane kii maang kar di
 This is the demand of the Shiromani Akali Dal for years
 congressi is baat se pareshaan hai ki rahul ke ikraar ne gujarat ke 2002 ke godhra cond ke baad hue dangon ko 1984 dangon ke barakes laa khadaa kiya he
 Asked what Gandhi would do in the cases of Congressmen like former Maharashtra Chief Minister Ashok Chavan and Himachal Pradesh Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh, he was asked repeatedly in his speeches that he repeatedly mentioned the 'anti-corruption structure'
 Giving
 kabhi rahul kii media team main kaam kar chuke unke ek sahyogi kehete hai, “unke intervyuu ne puraane mudde ko jinda kar charchaa main laa diya he
 At that time, even if they were sorry, nothing would have deteriorated, Rahul could have easily said that the Congress President and the Prime Minister have already regretted the matter and they are doing the same
 haalanki sikh dangon ke samay ve bamushkil 12 saal ke the
 At the same time, he could put the Chief Minister of Gujarat in the dock by saying that Narendra Modi plays the politics of discrimination and yet he does not regret his actions
 ” unhone yah bhi kaha, “2008 main amritsar main yuva congress kii press conference main rahul ne zyada safagoi se apni baat rakhi thi
 After speaking at the Golden Temple on November 18, 2008, Rahul had spoken to reporters in Amritsar about the 1984 Sikh riots: "I believe these riots were sheer wrong
" in dangon main jin logon kaa haath tha, unhen dand milanaa chahie
 "in Rahul's interview given more than five years later, he did not get clear
 andruni taur par congress main is baat par aam sahmati he ki rahul ko or adhik taiyaari ke saath us intervyuu ke liye janaa chahie tha—congress ke liye yah koi choti baat nahin
 The negative comments on Rahul's statement on social media have surprised the Congress
 kai congressi netaa to yah maanane se bhi parhez kar rahe hai
 The party hoped that some of Rahul's supporters and followers would make some comments on social media and he would be praised for such a long interview
 congress netaaon ne modi ke do puraane intervyuu ke link twit kiye jab gujarat ke mukhyamantri ne 2002 dangon se jude sawaal puche jane par intervyuu ko achaanak bich main hi chhod diya tha
 Nevertheless, Rahul's mockery on social media kept blowing
 rahul kii chhavi chamakaane ke uddeshy se tainaat logon ke lambey-chaude prabandhan tantra se jude shaks ne mana ki “pradhanmantri kii team ne press conference se do din pehle hi rahul kii taiyaari kara di thi
 They also should have practiced more
 ” pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne apni press conference ke liye 28 mantralayon se mili tathyon ke aadhaar par unki team ke taiyaar 100 se bhi adhik sawaalon ke jariye khud ko chaak-chauband kiya tha
 At the same time, it seems that Rahul himself did not do much hard work
 rahul ne yah to kah diya ki congress party chunaav jeetegi, lekin yah kehane se chook gaye ki agar vaisaa hi kuch hone vaala he to upie-3 kaa thos khaakaa kya hoga
 Rahul used the word "system" more than 70 times in his interview, while "women empowerment" around 18
 system kii baat karte hue yah bhul gaye ki desh main zyaadaatar samay tak system ko unki party hi chalaati rahi he
 The lack of preparation of Rahul for the Congress has also led to bigger problems
 sonia gandhi ke charanbaddh tareeke se rahul gandhi ko kaman saunpane kii vaastaviktaa ko party ke puraane dhurandhar dhire-dhire manjuur karne lage hai
 But the manner in which he was kept away from this interview of Rahul has upset the senior party leaders
 yahaan tak ki congress adhyaksh ke salaahkaaron kii bhi raay nahin lee gai
 a leader who has been considered close to Rahul for a long time was surprised when such a discussion reached him that Rahul's interview was recorded for TV
 ek netaa kehete hai ki “hamaare kaaryakarta isi se khush hai ki modi yaa kejariwal nahin, balki unke netaa surkhiyon main hai
 They will get better with experience
 ” congress main zyaadaatar logon ko yah baat samaj main nahin aa rahi ki rahul ko yahi sab karnaa tha to unhone pehle kyon nahin kiya? congressiyon ke man main is sawaal kaa uthanaa vaazib he kyonki unke upaadhyaksh ne intervyuu main khule shabdon main sweekaar kiya ki unke lakshya ekadam spasht hai or ve inke liye varshon se kaam kar rahe hai
 In the Congress advertisement prepared for election campaign, Rahul has been projected as a super hero who will eliminate all the problems of the people, but it seems that this Congress leader is a dilemma about himself because the questions He gets stuck in answering
 haryana se congress ke netaa kehete hai, “17 janvari ko dilli main hui ol india congress cameti kii baithak main rahul ek aakraamak yuva netaa ke taur par saamne aae, maano koi general apni sena ko yuddh ke liye taiyaar kar rahaa ho
 The activists had expected the same from Rahul's first TV interview, but he got a slight glimpse of it
 ”rahul ke is avatar se jude ghatnakram se kareebi se jude sutara ne bataaya ki rahul ko surkhiyon main banaae rakhane kii niti main kahin koi badlaav nahin aayaa he
 Rahul is still firm on his plan to give more interviews to the media and ensure maximum presence in public forums
 iske saath hi ghoshnaptr par vibhinn tabakaai samoohon ke saath hone vaali baithkon main bhi ve lagaataar shirkat karne kaa man bana chuke hai
 The source further states, "he appears as an honest young leader whom you can trust, there is no reason to fear him
" intervyuu se saaf he ki ve ek insaan hai
 "of course if a normal person, he will also make a mistake
 lekin yah insaan yadi netaa he or vah apni galati par maafee bhi nahin maangata to use isaki keemat adaa kerani pad sakati he
 Plans of telecom companies will be expensive from the beginning of December
 Recently, Jio also announced that the company's plans will be expensive
 After the Supreme Court gave the decision of AGR payment in favor of the government, Vodafone Idea first increased its mobile plans from December Airtel made the same announcement shortly thereafter
 in donon companiyon ke baad jeeyo ne bhi aisi ghoshnaa kar graahakon ko jhatka de diya
 The right way, a report was completed in which it was told that BSNL is going to make its plans expensive from December
 yani sari badi companiyaan disambar kii shuruyaat se apane mobile plance mahange karne ja rahi hai
 But it is not yet clear how much the price will be increased
 ab ek report saamne ai he, jisamen bataaya gaya he ki privet telecom companiyon ke plance kitne mahange ho sakate hai
 According to a report by Deccan Herald, Airtel, Jio and Vodafone Idea customers may have to pay up to 20 percent more for all recharge plans in the future
 report main bataaya gaya he ki alag-alag industry sutron ne ye pushti kii he ki saare richarge plance kii keemton main sambhavat: 20 pratishat tak kii badhotaree kii jaaegi
 However, the price increase will depend on the price of recharge plans
 yani puri sambhaavna he ki saste richarge plance kii keemton main maamuli badhotaree hogi, vahiin mahange richarge plance kii keemton main 20 pratishat ke hisaab se zyada badhotaree dekhne ko milegi
 The report states that telecom companies are planning to hike prices on incremental basis
 report main ye bhi kaha gaya he ki postped yugers kii tulana main zyada prabhaav preeped yugers ko padegaa
 However, it is not confirmed at the moment
 yani kulamilaakar telecom companiyon ke saare richarge plance kii keemton main uniform tareeke se badhotaree dekhne ko milegi
 In such a situation, people who use plans within 100 rupees now will have less effect
 dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki kya keemton ke alaava wais or data ke phaaydon main bhi koi prabhaav padataa he

 alqaida ke baad jis aatanki sanghathan ne duniya ko daraaya he wo he ISIS, jisko lekar kai tarah kii kahaniyaan saamne aa chuki hai
 Amazon Prime Video, influenced by this issue, has brought out a web-series called Jack Ryan
 mulat: ye series Tom Clancy ke noval par aadhaarit he
 This episode of just 8 episodes was released in early September
 jo prime par hi uplabdh he
 What's the Story
 
 ? Jack Ryan is employed as Analyst in the American Intelligence Agency CIA
 uski samaj itani shandaar he ki unke senior unhen ground oparation main istemaal karte hai
 ISIS leader Sulaiman kidnaps and conditions some US scientists
 Jack usase ek mishan ke dauraan france main mil chukaa he, isliye vah kuch plan team ke saamne rakhata he, us plan par puri team par aage badhati he
 While this story is going on, Jack falls in love with a doctor, but he does not reveal that he is an agent of the CIA
 is bich CIA sultan ke parivaar ko apane paas le aata he
 By following Jack's plan, America saves its citizens and Suleman is killed
 isi kamyaabi ke kaaran Jack ko pramotion miltaa he
 At the end of the season a hook is found which suggests that the next season may be Mission Russia (russia)
 mukhya kirdaar koun hai
 
 ?jack Ryan kaa kirdaar John Krasinski ne nibhaayaa he, unke alaava unki garlfriend doctor Cathy Mueller, jinka kirdaar Abbie Cornish ne nibhaayaa he
 The rest are played by Wendell Pierce (CIA officer), Ali Suleiman, Mousa Bin Suleiman
 kisi rahi series?siries kaa mudda kaaphi ahm he lekin jis prakaar se nirdesan he usase kaaphi niraashaa hoti he
 Also, John does not like you in the character of Jack
 jis prakaar kaa ection or drama puri siries main dikhaaya gaya he, us hisaab se John kairactor main wo intence nahin laa paa rahe hai
 Not only action but in the time of romance, they will be seen in different phase
 Wendell Pierce apane kirdaar main khub jamate hai, isse pehle aapane unhen Suits ke kai sijan main dekha hoga
 Here too, his role and work has remained strong
 baaki kirdaar apni-apni jagah thik kaam kar rahe hai
 What would you like to see? If told easily, if you have seen Salman Khanki Tiger Zinda Hai, then you will not want to watch this series
 kyonki jis tarah salmaan apni film main akele hi ISIS kaa khaatmaa kar aate hai, usee tarah yahaan bhi dikhaaya gaya he
 However, the difference is that Salman is making a mark in his character, but John is seen doing injustice to the character of Jack
 aage kya hoga?aisa nahin he ki siries bilkul bhi acchhee nahin he
 There are some episodes in between that keep you tied up
 lekin jaise hi wo pes bananaa shuru hota he sijan hi khatm ho jaataa he
 The next season may also come soon
 saath hi ye sijan mishan rus par aadhaarit hoga

 It is often seen that people keep in their pujagrahs an ambar of many deities (idols) of various deities, though it is a matter of their reverence but in our scriptures, the rule of worship of five deities for each householder is given
 
 jise 'panchayatan' kaha jaataa he
 "panchayatan" worship is considered superior in Sanatan Dharma
 ye paanch dev hai- ganesh, shiv, vishnu, durga (devi) va surya
 According to the scripture, it is mandatory to have the deity or statue of these five deities in the poojagriha of every household
 in 5 devon ke vigrahon ko apane isht dev ke anusaar singhaasana main sthapit karne kaa bhi ek nishchit kram he

 2
 shiv panchayatan-yadi aapke isht shiv hai to aap apane puujagrih main 'shiv panchayatan' kii sthapana karen
 For this, you install Vishnu in the northern side of the throne, Sun in the fiery angle, Shiva in the middle, Ganesha in the north corner and Goddess Deity in the Vyavya angle
 3
 Vishnu Panchayat - If you have Vishnu, you should establish 'vishnu Panchayat' in your worship home
 iske liye aap singhaasana ke ishan kone main shiv, aagney kone main ganesh, madhya main vishnu, nairrity kone main surya evam vivy kone main devi vigrah ko sthapit karen
 4
 durga (devi) panchayatan-yadi aapaki isht durga (devi) hai to aap apane puujagrih main 'devi panchayatan' kii sthapana karen
 For this, you install Vishnu in the northern side of the throne, Shiva in the fiery angle, Durga (goddess) in the middle, Ganesha in the northern corner and Surya Vigraha in the Vyavya angle
 5
 Surya Panchayat - If you have Suryadev, you should establish 'surya Panchayat' in your worship home

 There are few days left for the end of financial year 2018-19

 The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has expressed concern about this
 iske saath hi sibiditi ne inakam tex department ko tex choron se nipatane ke liye har sambhav karrwai karne ko kaha he

 yah ek chintajanak sthiti he , jisaki taraf turant dhyaan dene kii jarurat he
 "the officer expressed disappointment over the situation and asked the tax authorities to gear up and leave no stone unturned to achieve the goal of direct tax collection
 nina kumaar ne patr main kaha ki niyamit tex akalan pradarshan kaa paimaana (benchmark) he or yah tex maang kii gunvattta par aadhaarit hota he
 This can be further transformed into actual collections
 board ne iskar adhikariyon ke saath is bare main ranneeti par charchaa kii thi or ummid thi ki collection main sudhaar hoga
 But the figures are telling something else
 unhone inakam tex department se tatkaal harsambhav kadam uthaane ko kaha he taaki maujuuda or bakaayaa tex kii vasuuli ho sake or lakshya hasil kiya ja sake

 unhone kaha kicongresane jaipur sammelan main vaada kiya tha ki un logon ko tikat nahin diya jaayegaa jo baari maton se haare hai, congress netaaon ke rishtedaar hai or apradhi hai
 Modi said, 'the Congress has blown its promises
 karnataka chunaav main usne kya 15 hajaar se adhik voton se haarane waalon, congress netaaon ke rishtedaaron or aparaadhiyon ko tikat nahin diya he ?
 Modi said that culture in India has been that children follow what the mother says
 uske baad modi ne sonia gandhi ke is bayaan kaa zikr kiya ki ‘satta jehar he’
 He said that the mother says, "power is poison" and the son (rahul Gandhi) comes to Karnataka demanding power for the party
 rahul gandhi kaa naam liye bagaiyr unhone unki khilli udaate hue kaha ki congress upaadhyaksh to karnataka ke mukhyamantri jagadish shettar kaa naam bhi nahin bol paayenge
 He alleged that Rahul tried to tarnish Karnataka's image during the election campaign and demanded that he apologize to the people of the state, pointing to the 2G scam and saying, "courage to see, they speak on corruption Huh
 ’unhone sarbajit singh prakaran orchini ghuspaith se sampragake nipatane ke taur tareeke kii aalochana karte hue kaha ki desh ne aisi kamjor centre sarkaar kabhi nahin dekhi
 Read what Modi said in the Bangalore election speech
 - karnataka main apana CM ummidavaar to bataae congress
 Amidst the crisis, Jagdish Shettar did the work
 - karnataka main bijepi ne vikaas kiya
 - No hand of Congress in Karnataka, Congress should show the face of CM
 - 5 saal main party ne kai kathinaayeeyaan jheli
 - Like Gujarat, there will be development in Karnataka
 - congress bharose ke laayak nahin
 - The crisis of the party has no effect on development
 - karnataka main dobaaraa galtiyaan nahin hogi
 - Government of Delhi grieved
 - congress ne sirf parivaarwaad ko badhaava diya he
 - All promises of Rahul Gandhi coming from Jaipur to Karnataka were false
 - congress kaa mahangaai dur karne kaa vaada jhootha
 - Congress became a burden on the country
 - kya dilli puri tarah se surakshit he
 - BJP government better than Congress governments
 - maa bolti he satta jehar he, par betaa karnataka main satta maang rahaa he
 But Modi also faced opposition in this rally

 The director duo, who have so far given films such as Noise in the City (2011) and Go Goa Gone (2013), have come up with a romantic comedy this time
 vaise bhi saf ali khan jab bhi apane binar tale film lekar aate hai to usamen kuch hatakar karne kii koshish karte hai
 Sometimes his story is different and sometimes his treatment
 happy andingke saath bhi kuch aisa hi he
 It is a very easy film and has many laughable moments
 govinda ko baar-baar dekhne kaa man karata he or film main vah saare gun pirone kii koshish kii gai he, jo ise kam se kam ek baar dekhne laayak to banaate hi hai
 How much of the story writer in the story
 hit kitaab de chuke hai or agali ke liye sangharshrat hai
 Struggling with the situation
 isi bich unki mulaakaat bollywood superstar govinda se hoti he, jise hollywood style film kii kahani chahie
 Ileana's entry occurs in the midst of all this
 chunauti milti he
 Love happens
 masti hoti he or sab kuch bahut swaabhaavik hota he
 Often similar to Saif's films
 lekin film kaa treetment or jis nae tarah kaa andaaj raaj or dike lekar aae hai, vah acha lagata he
 The story is loose in many places but it is good because there is not much tamar
 star apilsaf ali khan kii acting acchhee he
 His style is very similar to Love Aaj Kal but he accumulates in his role and looks good
 film kaa sarprise package govinda hai
 They dominate Saif Ali
 agar film main unka role thodaa or zyada hota to khub majaa aata
 Govinda seems to be returning to its colors
 yah unke chaahane waalon ke liye acchhee khabar he
 Ileana d'cruz likes it
 kalki bhi apane role main thik hai
 Earnet Ki Baat and DK make Hollywood style films
 unki filmon main nae concept aate hai or youth audiyans ke mutabik treetment hota he
 Happy ending is also like this
 film ko metro shaharon ko target karke banaaya gaya lagata he, lekin govinda masej ke paas tak jane kaa kaam kar sakate hai
 The budget of the film is 50 crores
 bataaya ja rahaa he
 In such a situation, the big challenge before the film is to do well
 is film ko lekar verde of mouth bhi kaam karegaa lekin kul milakar kisi recordtod dhamal kii ummid kam hi he
 Yes, the film can be seen once if it is leisure
 bihar main chathe charan kaa chunaav kaaphi rochak hone ja rahaa he
 On May 12, votes will be cast in 8 Lok Sabha seats of Bihar in the sixth phase
 ye siten hai- valmikinagar, pashchim champaran, purvi champaran, shivahar, vaishali, gopalganj, siwan or maharajaganj
 NDA candidates won all these seats in the 2014 elections, but this time there is a strong challenge from the Grand Alliance
 is charan main champaran kii 4 siten bhi hai jahaan pichley kuch chunaav se bijepi kii dhak he
 But the equations on these seats have changed in the 2019 election summer
 badi partiyon kii kshetreey partiyon ke saath golbandi voton kaa jamini ganit badal rahi he
 Mathematics has changed inside the parties due to ticket cut
 rochak baat ye he ki endie ke 8 main se 4 vartmaan saansadon ke tikat cat gaye hai
 The reason for this is the lack of seats in the BJP to give space to JDU for the alliance
 inamen 3 bijepi ke saansad hai or ek algepi kaa
 These are four seats - Siwan, Gopalganj, Vaishali and Valmikinagar
 sabhi 8 siton par endie or mahagathbandhan ke bich sidhaa muqabla he
 However, the attitude of the sitting mps will be crucial in the election
 kahaan kiskaa kisase he muqabla-valmikinagar-vartmaan saansad hai BJP ke satish chandra dube
 This time a fight between Baidyanath Prasad Mahato of JDU and the eternal Kedar of Congress
 pashchim champaran-vartmaan saansad hai BJP ke dow

 kabhi koi dost ghar kaa khaanaa lekar aa jaae to jaise lottery nikal jaati thi
 Finally fed up with eating outside, my health responded
 maine gas-chulhaa kharida or google par apni pasandida racippi search kar bananaa shuru kiya
 Cooking was not as difficult and useless as i thought
 ab do saal ke andar main khaanaa banane main export ho gai hum
 i do not believe it, say my friends and my mother, who are very happy to cook and eat my food
 yahi nahin jo dost abhi khud khaanaa bananaa nahin jaanate hai, unako bhi aksar banaakar khilaati hum

 unhone daawa kiya he ki 23 may ko chunaav ke nattejey aaenge or phir ek baar modi sarkaar aegi
 Then we are going to give benefit of PM Kisan Samman Nidhi scheme to all farmers of Bihar

 23 may ko chunaav ke nattejey aaenge or phir ek baar modi sarkaar aegi
 Then we are going to give benefit of PM Kisan Samman Nidhi scheme to all farmers of Bihar
 philhal iske liye 5 acre kii jo seemaa he wo hataa di jaaegi: piem @narendramodi # jeetegatomodihijinhomne bihar kii pahchaan badali thi, wo is chunaav main centre main apni sarkaar banane ke liye nahin lard rahe, wo kisi bhi tarah se apane sadsy badhaane ke liye chatapata rahe hai
 Increasing their strength means bringing back the days of plunder, kidnapping, corruption in Bihar
 unki takat badhaane kaa matlab he betiyon kaa apharan, gundgardee, hatyaein, har yojana main bhrashtachar
 To increase their strength means to be imprisoned in their own house after the sun sets, to live choking, to be forced to flee
 phir se ye log bihar main giddh drushti jamaaye hai
 They want to prove their selfishness by dividing Bihar on the basis of caste, society
 apane bhrashtachar, kaale karnaamon ko chhipaana chaahate hai
 Their goal is to have a weak government in Delhi so that it can do it again arbitrarily
 piem modi bole ki jo jail main hai yaa jail ke daravaaje par hai
 Those who are on the vine or are circling the court for bail
 wo sab centre main ek majboot sarkaar ko ek minute bhi bardaasht nahin karnaa chaahate
 No matter how much they try, the campaign we have launched against black money and corruption will not slow down

 He said that wherever it is within the country or across the border, the factory that spreads terror and violence is on the target of this watchman
 bharat ko jahaan se bhi khatra hoga, ham ghar main ghuskar maarenge, ye tay he
 The history of the great people is such that they cannot say anything on terrorism, their feet tremble after hearing the name of Pakistan, their government starts to shudder, that is why they are allergic to air strike and surgical strike
 inaki zamin khisak rahi he, kyonki 5 varsh main sabakaa saath-sabakaa vikaas kii raajnneetik samskruti hamane viksit kii he
 10% reservation to the poor youth of the general category is a great effort for social harmony, as it has been given without disturbing the rights of any other class

 That is why even after desolation and settling seven times, there is a great dispatch in this city
 conot place se shantipath tak failaa lutiuns jone kshetra pashchim ke suvyavasthit nagar jaisaa prathit hota he vahiin puraani dilli kii sankari galiyaan ‘banaras’ kii yaad taaja kar detii hai
 The British made New Delhi the capital of a unified India in place of Calcutta in 1911, a situation which was not changed even after independence
 itihaaskaaron ke mutabik, desh main bahut kam nagar he, jo dilli kii tarah apane dirghakaalin avichhinn astitv evam pratishtha ko banaaye rakhane kaa daawa kar saken
 The first medieval city of Delhi was founded by the Tomar rulers, which was called Dhilli or Dhillika
 itihaaskaar vaai di sharma ke anusaar, dhillika naam kaa pratham ullekh udaipur ke bijoliya ke 1170 isvi ke abhilekh main aata he, jisamen dilli par chahvaanon (chouhanon) dwaara adhikaar kiye jane ke ullekh he
 Its name is written in the Palam Baoli inscription of 1276 of Ghiyasuddin Tughlaq, which is located in Hariyanak region
 unke anusaar, laal kila sangrahalay main rakhe mohammad bin tughlaq ke 1328 ke abhilekh main hariyana main dhillika nagar ke hone kaa ullekh he
 Similarly, the 1316 inscription of Ladnun of Didwana mentions Dhilli Nagar in Haritan region
 sharma ne spasht likhaa he, ‘angreji shabd dely yaa dihali yaa dilli isi se niklaa he, jo abhilekhon main dhilli kaa samya he
 It is a mere imagination to associate it with the Hindi word 'dehri'
 ’ dilli par tomars, chouhan, gulam, khilji, tughlaq, saiyad, lodi, sur, mughal vansh ke shaskaon ne raaj kiya or 1911 main angrejon ne kalakatta ke sthaan par ise ekikrut bharat kii rajdhani banaaya, jis sthiti ko aazaadee ke baad bhi badla nahin gaya
 According to the Mahabharata, the capital of the Kuru country was located at Hastinapur on the banks of the Ganges and after the relations between the Kauravas and the Pandavas deteriorated, Dhritarashtra gave them the territory of Khandavaprastha on the banks of the Yamuna
 yahaan basaaye gayi nagar kaa naam indrapastha tha
 According to Sharma, the site of the old fort built in the sixteenth century was probably inhabited by Indraprastha, the capital of the warriors of the epic Mahabharata
 is sthaan par puraatatv surveykshan vibhaag ne khudaai bhi kii, jisamen praarambhik aitihaasik kaal se lekar madhyakaal tak ke awaas hone ke pramaan mili hai
 Here evidence of houses, soak-wells and streets up to the north Gupta period, Saka, Kushan and Maurya period has been found
 1966 main maury samraat ashok ke 273-236 isa purv ke abhilekh kii khoj 1966 main hui, jo shrinivasapuri par aravali parvat shrinkhalaa ke ek chor par khurduri chattan par khuda hua he
 According to Sharma, the first of the seven cities dates back to the late tenth century, but this is not enough to provide evidence of Delhi's past and represents the entire period of its long and significant history here
 aisa lagata he ki dilli ke aasapaas pehali basti lagbhag teen hajaar saal pehle basii thi or puraane kile kii khudaai main mili bhure rang ke mitti ke bartan mili hai, jo ek hajaar saal se adhik puraane he
