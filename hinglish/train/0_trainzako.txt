 Sai Baba fulfills every wish of his devotees and therefore everyone wants that once Sai Baba is seen, then life is blessed
 jahaan khud sai kaa vaas ho us nagari main guru poornima kaa najaara adbhut to hoga hi
 3000 devotees arrived from Pune to see Sai and offer him Guru Dakshina
 sai kii bhakthi main jhuumate matavaalon ne pune se shiridy tak kaa safar paidal tay kiya
 Now you call it the power of devotion or the miracle of Sai

 Especially on the day of Guru Purnima, devotees give seven days to their Baba by giving Guru Dakshina
 bhakt bhi tarah-tarah ke shraddha kii abhivyakti karte hai
 When someone decorated Sai with colorful flowers, a devotee placed him on a silver chariot
 kisi ne sai ke charnon main sone ke diye arpan kar die to kisi ne raktadan karke hi guru ko dakshina di
 a devotee from Hyderabad presented a gold Guru Dakshina at the feet of Sai
 jeaar raav naam ke bhakt ne sai ko sone ke do diye bhent kiye, jinaki keemat 25 lakh rupee se bhi zyada he
 There is no distinction of big and small in Sai's court
 naa hi oonch neech yaa garib-amir kii khai hoti he
 Sai belongs to everyone and all to Sai
 shiridy ke sai ne barabari kaa sandesh diya tha or guru poornima ke pavitra maukey par sai kaa yahi sandesh samadhi mandir main aae bhakton ko mil rahaa he
 a devotee said that Sai Baba helped many miseries in his lifetime with his blessings and also freed him from all diseases

 But later it was reported that the Kim administration has allowed South Korean journalists to visit Pyongri's nuclear site
 kim ke paas hameshaa rahata he plan bimarshall kim jong un ne to apana vaada puraa kar diya lekin agar america raashtrapati donald trump apane vaade se mukarte hai to unhen ye yaad rakhana chahie ki kim ke paas hameshaa plan bi maujuud rahata he
 Even if he destroyed the site of Pyong-ri in front of media cameras around the world, according to intelligence, he has another nuclear site which is closed in the eyes of the world
 magar kim jab chaahe use dobaaraa shuru kar saktaa he
 North Korea has a second nuclear site! It is believed to be another nuclear site in North Korea in Yongbyon
 jise 1976 main banaaya gaya tha
 However, under international pressure, North Korea had to close the site in 2008
 lekin 5 saal yani 2013 main kim jong un ne is site ko dobaaraa shuru karne kii dhamkee bhi de di thi
 In the month of January and September 2015, suspicious activity was observed at this plant
 mana gaya ki uttar korian sarkaar ise dobaaraa shuru karne kii koshish kar rahi he
 And in 2016, the IAEA, the International Atomic Energy Agency, had said that it would get plutonium production in this plant
 baat nahin bani to phir mandaraayega vishwayuddh kaa khatrauttar korea jab chaahe is newclear site ko dobaaraa puri tarah shuru kar saktaa he
 And here he can easily make so much plutonium, from which many nuclear bombs can be prepared
 lihaaza jaankaar maanate hai ki america raashtrapati donald trump ye samajhane kii bhul naa karen ki wo pyong-ri site ko khatm kara ke kim ke mansoobon ko roak paaenge
 And by withdrawing from the conversation, it is possible that Donald Trump may even annoy Kim
 or is baar marshall ko naaraaz karne kaa matlab hoga ki baat sachmuch yuddh par aakar khatm ho
 That is, once again the world will be threatened by world war

 The government is working on a scheme that will help keep interest rates low, a Credit Guarantee Fund Scheme on Education Loans is being finalized which will not only benefit banks but also students

 This scheme will be put in front of the cabinet soon
 is fund se bainkon ko 7
 Guarantee up to 5 lakh rupees
 unhen lone acount ke non parforming ghoshit hone par byaaj main 75 pratishat tak kii guarantee milegi
 But 7
 5 lakh rupee se upar tak ke lone kii guarantee nahin di jaaegi kyonki uske liye bank jamaanat maangate hai
 An official of the Ministry of Human Resource Development told the English newspaper The Times of India that the scheme would help the banks a lot and they would be able to reduce the interest rates
 iskaa kaaran yah hoga ki guarantee lene vaale bainkon ke liye yah shart hogi ki ve landing rate se do pratishat se zyada byaaj dar par lone nahin denge, isse bahut se bank byaaj daren ghataaenge
 Actually, the problem of banks is that at present, students take loans on a large scale but do not repay
 isse bainkon kaa enpie bad rahaa he

 From today onwards, Jammu and Kashmir will become a Union Territory with Legislative Assembly
 J-K Ladakh has also come into existence as two new Union Territories from today
 Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh today
 jammu-kashmir ke uparajyapal ke pad par jisi murmu or ladakh ke leftinent governor ke taur par radha krishna maathur ne shapath lee
 In such a situation, the question arises that when will the Kashmiri people elect their government and when will the release of the political prisoners detained in the name of law and order? dhara 370 hataane ke baad sthaneey police ne ehtiyaat ke taur par kashmir ke algaavvaadi sanghathanon se jude logon ke saath hi mukhyadhara kii partiyon ke netaaon, raajnneetik-saamaajik kaaryakartaaon ko hiraasat main liya tha
 These include former Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti, Omar Abdullah and other leaders
 in sabhi netaaon ko prashasan ne pichley teen maheene se najarband kar rakhaa he
 However, on the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti on 2 October, the Jammu and Kashmir administration removed the detention of leaders of all opposition parties under house arrest in Jammu
 dogra swabhimaan sanghathan party ke adhyaksh choudhary laal singh ke alaava neshnal conference ke devendra rana or eses salathia, congress raman bhalla or panthars party ke harshdev singh najarbandi ke baad baahar aa chuke hai, lekin kashmir ke netaa ab bhi najarband hai
 In such a situation, there is a question as to when the administration will arrest these leaders, because they cannot be kept in captivity for too long
 haalanki sarkaar or prashasan ne ghati ke kuch logon ko bond bharwakar shart ke saath najarbandi hataai he
 Since then, it is believed that the government can release the leaders with detention in Kashmir
 
 When should the people of Kashmir choose their government? Since the existence of Jammu and Kashmir as a union territory, now everyone has in mind that when will the people of Kashmir elect their government
 soobe kii halaat ko dekhte hue philhal abhi kareeb chah maheene tak chunaav kii koi sambhaavna najar nahin aa rahi he, kyonki centreshasit rajya banane ke baad jammu-kashmir kii raajnneetik hi nahin balki bhugolic sthiti main bhi badlaav hua he
 After becoming the Governor of GC Murmu in Jammu and Kashmir, the state will be delimited under restructuring
 iske baad ladakh ke tahat aane vaali chaar vidhansabha siten alag ho jaaengi
 After this, the assembly seats in Jammu and Kashmir will be determined on the basis of population
 is prakriya main lanbaa samay lagegaa
 Apart from this, the most important situation is to see Jammu and Kashmir
 aise main jab tak pradesh kii haalat saamaanya nahin ho jaati he tab tak chunaav karana sambhav nahin hoga
 However, since the withdrawal of Article 370 and the formation of Union Territory, there has been no major incident nor any stone pelting
 jammu-kashmir ke halaat aise hi saamaanya bane rahe to prashasan vidhansabha siton ke parisemen ke baad chunaav kii taiyaari shuru kar saktaa he
 In such a situation, the people of Jammu and Kashmir will get the chance to choose their government again

 Returning officer Manish Faujdar of the polling station where 18 evms were found to be wrong, also said that there was a problem in the machines due to which voting was stopped, but we have no one to complain about the vote of one party to another party

 Australia's great fast bowler Glenn mcgrath, impressed by the skills of the young fast bowlers at the Chennai-based MRF Pace Academy, said on Wednesday that the search for more fast bowlers from North India could be completed by looking for hard-hitting bowlers

 aise gendbaaj nahin he jo 150 se adhik kii teji se gend daal saken
 "he said," But people in North India are physically strong and strong

 It is not known whether genetics plays a role in this
 agar aapke paas 6 foot 4 inch lanbaa gendbaaj he or vah shaktishaalee he to use vah oochaal milegi jo 6 foot se kam kad ke gendbaaj ko nahin milegi
 You get the benefit of being tall but it is not the only benefit

 ummid kii ja rahi thi ki modi cabinet main mahesh sharma ko jagah milegi lekin aisa nahin hua
 After the non-appointment of a minister, the discussion is on whether Mahesh Sharma did not get a place in the cabinet due to the alleged CD case or whether he will get significant responsibility in the party's organization
 bataa den ki 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main pehali baar mahesh sharma gautamabuddhanagar loksabhaa seat se jitkar narendra modi sarkaar main shaamil hue the
 Mahesh Sharma was given the responsibility of the Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation (independent Charge) in the Modi Cabinet
 paanch saal tak unke mantralay main koi pherbadal nahin kiya gaya
 Looking at Mahesh Sharma's previous term, it seemed that this time too he would get a place in the cabinet but it did not happen
 ab charchaa us sidi maamle kii ho rahi he jiske jariye unhen blackmel kiya ja rahaa tha
 She was being blackmailed by a female journalist by phone
 darasal march maheene main patrkaar ne kendriya mantri se baat kar ek video bana liya tha, usee video ke aadhaar par blackmel kar unase do karod rupye kii maang kii ja rahi thi
 On the complaint of Mahesh Sharma, the police arrested the journalist from Kailash Hospital
 is sabake peeche ek band ho chuke channel kaa maalik master mind tha
 Apart from this, after Mahesh Sharma was not made a minister, it is also being speculated that he is not being sent to the party organization
 darasal uttar pradesh ke bijepi adhyaksh mahendranath pandeya ko modi cabinet main shaamil kiya gaya he
 In this way, instead of Mahendranath Pandey, someone else can be given command of the party
 aise main mana ja rahaa he ki mahendranath pandeya kii jagah mahesh sharma ko pradesh adhyaksh banaaya jayega jisaki vajah se unhen mantrimandal main shaamil nahin kiya gaya
 Talking to Aaj Tak, senior journalist Urmilesh said that there could be three reasons for not being included in the cabinet
 pehali yah ki jinhen mantri nahin banaaya gaya he, unase sanghathan main kaam lenaa hoga
 The second is that the cabinet has been kept small, so that when the cabinet is expanded later, they can be included
 iske alaava teesri vajah he ki unhen sirf saansad ke taur par rakhana chaahate hai, jiske chalate mantri nahin banaaya gaya
 Urmilesh says that as far as Mahesh Sharma is concerned, why has he not sung him? yah baat sirf pradhanmantri narendra modi or amit shah kii bataa sakate hai
 However, if he is not made a minister, then work can be done in the organization, because BJP can prove useful
 darasal mahesh sharma kaa naam isse pehle bhi bijepi pradesh adhyaksh ke liye charchaa main aayaa tha
 Apart from this, Mahesh Sharma was also involved in the CM race in the UP assembly elections, but later Yogi Adityanath's name was stamped

 In the last general election, the party won 71 out of 80 seats in the state
 vidhansabha ke hisaab se dekha jaae to ye 403 main se 337 siten banati hai
 Obviously, such a big victory in the complicated politics of UP is not an easy task
 khaskar tab jab samaajawaadee party ne aapasi kalah ke baad ab gathbandhan kii siyasat kii apana lee he
 Among the major concerns of the BJP, there is also a possibility of Muslim voters being mobilized towards the Samajwadi Party
 gathbandhan bigaadega bijepi kaa khel?pashchimi upi main samaajawaadee party kuch khaas majboot nahin he
 Barring Badaun, the Yadavas, the strongest supporters of the party, have a very small population in most districts of the region
 mujffarnagar, shamali, meerut, hapur, mathura, bagpat, noida or gajiabad jaise jile jaaton kaa garh maane jate hai
 The BJP already has a strong presence in urban areas of these places
 parivaar ke jhagade se ubar kar akhilesh yadav congress or choti partiyon ke saath gathbandhan ko aakhri rup de rahe hai
 But BJP strategists are worried that bringing the smaller parties together may reverse the declining political graph of the Samajwadi Party
 congress ke saath aane se party zyaadaatar jagahon par bijepi ko takkar dene kii haalat main hogi
 The alliance of the two parties will also unite a very important Muslim vote bank for victory
 bijepi aas lagaae baithi thi ki muslimon kaa samarthan samaajawaadee party, bispi or congress ke bich bant jayega or iskaa sidhaa phayda use pahonchega
 If this calculation proved to be wrong in western UP, the same trend can be seen in the entire state
 congress factorcongress bhale hi loksabhaa chunaav main sirf do hi seat jeet paayi ho, lekin lakhanu, kanpur, barabanki, gajiabad, saharanpur jaisi kai siton par uske ummidavaar duusare number par rahe the
 If the party's votebank supports the Akhilesh Yadav-led coalition, the bjp's difficulty will increase
 bijepi ko ye bhi chintaa he ki notebandi kaa asar shahari votaron, khaskar kaarobaariyon ke vot par pad saktaa he

 Manjhi is now asking for his son and a chair for himself, but my fight was for the benefit of the poor and this party was formed for the benefit of the poor
 narendra singh ne kaha ki main kaaryakarini kaa sadsy rahaa hum, maine kabhi pad nahin sweekaara
 We are the convener of the party, make the party, the executive members are enough, one he himself did wrong, first became the president himself and made the son the principal secretary

 diwali ke maddenjar pataakhon par supreme court ke faisle ke baad ek taraf jahaan logon main bain hatane kii khushi he to vahiin paryaavaran adhikari bhi is maamle main santosh jataa rahe hai
 But what is the low pollution and low noise crackers of green firecrackers mentioned in the Supreme Court verdict? To know this, the team of Delhi Aaj Tak reached Garuwar in all the big firecrackers markets of Delhi
 team ne dukandaaron or kharidaaron donon se baat kii
 Shopkeepers do not have temporary license right now
 If you want to buy firecrackers in Delhi right now, then you will only meet those shops who have license to sell Permanent i
e
 year round crackers
 darasal, jo dukandaar kevaldivalike maukey parpatakhebechate hai, unhen asthai license diya jaataa he, lekin supreme court ke aadesh ke baad abhi license jari nahin kiye gaye hai
 There is confusion among shopkeepers that Diwali is so close but the Delhi Police has not yet started the licensing process
 green pataakhon se anjaan logdelli ajtak ke samvaadadaataaon ne alag-alag bazaaron main jaakar kharidaaron orpataakhaa vikritaondonon se poocha ki akhir ye koun se pataakhe hai, jinamein kam pradooshan or kam awaz hoti he

 They do not know what kind of firecrackers to sell
 paryaavaran export maai brith dilli kii sansthaapak ravina raaj kaul se is bare main jaankaree leni chaahi to unhone bhi haath khadey kar die
 However, according to experts, chemical will be least used in these firecrackers
 karodon ke stock par sankatapataakhaa vikritaon kaa kahana he ki pichley saal bain hone se pehle jab unhone karodon rupee capatkhonkaa maal bhar rakhaa tha or uske baad supreme court ne bain laga diya tha to pichley saal se ab tak unka yah stock clear nahin ho paaya he
 This year, when only the less polluting firecrackers are allowed to sell, then the biggest crisis is where will the stock worth crores go? in dinon pariniti chopra apni nai film jabariyaa jodi ko lekar charchaa main hai

 i have been asked to share my experiences about what i got to learn while leading the country
 jab 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav ke baad main dilli aayaa, to vaaki bahut-si baton kaa anubhav mujhe nahin tha
 How the central government operates, what is the system
 system kya he—or yah baat mere liye ek vardaan sabit hui
 If i were a part of the old system, after the election it would have fit like a slot
 lekin aisa nahin hua
 i remember that before 2014, there used to be a discussion in your studio: what does Modi know what is going on in the world, Modi does not understand it? There is no experience
 aise main hamaari videsh niti kaa kya hoga? ye sawaal the or swaabhaavik the
 i do not believe these were wrong, because it was natural to raise questions about a person working in a limited state
 lekin beete dinon ke ghatnakram main, aapako dikhaai de gaya hoga ki bharat kii nai videsh niti kaa prabhaav aaj kya he
 Today's India is the new India, the changed India
 hamaare liye, ek-ek vir jawan kaa khun anmol he
 What used to happen before? No matter how many people are killed, how many soldiers are martyred, i do not think you would ever expect great resistance action
 lekin ab koi bhi bharat ko aankh dikhaane kaa saahas nahin kar saktaa
 Our government is committed to take every step necessary for the national interest
 aaj kaa nayaa bharat ek nai niti or reeti par chal rahaa he or puri duniya ne bharat ko samajhnaa shuru kar diya he
 Today's new India is fearless, fearless and decisive because today the country is moving forward with the efforts and faith of 1
25 billion Indians
 bharatiyon kii is ekajutata ne hi desh ke bheetar or baahar desh virdohi logon ke man main bhay paidaa kii he
 This is not the environment today, i will say this - this fear is good
 jab dushman main bharat ke parakram kaa dar ho to ye dar acha he
 When the terrorists fear the valor of the soldiers in the terrorists, then this fear is good
 jab bhagodon main bhi kanoon or apni sampatti jabt hone kaa dar ho to ye dar acha he
 This fear is also good when big families get angry by speaking of maternal uncle
 jab bhrasht netaaon ko bhi jail jane kaa dar sataae, to ye dar acha he
 When the corrupt people are afraid of the law, this fear is good
 swatantraaa ke baad ke dashakon main desh ne bahut kuch sah liya
 Now, this new India is moving forward relying on its strength, its resources and resources
 apni buniyadi kamajoriyon ko dur karne kaa or apni chunautiyon ko kam karne kaa prayaas kar rahaa he
 But there is a growing challenge before this India
 ye chunauti he apane hi desh kaa virodh or apane hi desh kaa majaak udaakar aatmasantushti kii pravriti kaa
 i wonder that today when the whole country stands with the army, some people are doubting the army
 ek taraf aaj puraa vishwa aatank ke khilaaf ladaai main bharat kaa saath de rahaa he to duusari taraf kuch partiyaan aatankwaad ke khilaaf hamaari ladaai par andeh kar rahi hai
 These are the same people whose statements, whose articles are being used as a proof against India on Pakistan's Parliament, Pakistan's channels, radio
 ye log modi virodh karte-karte desh virodh par utar aae hai
 Causing damage to the country
 main aaj, is manch se aise sabhi logon se poochna chahta hum ki aapako sena kii samathrya par vishwaas he yaa andeh he? main unase jaananaa chahta hum ki aapako hamaari sena kii kahi baton par he yaa phir aap un logon par bharosa karte hai jo hamaari dharti par aatankwaad ko badhaava de rahe hai? main aise sabhi logon or partiyon se kahana chahta hum ki kai modi aaenge, kai modi jaaenge, lekin ye desh ajar-amar rahegaa
 India is going to stay
 or isliye meraa aagrah he unase, kripaya apane rajnatik phaayde ke liye, apane bauddhik ahankaar kii pushti ke liye, desh kii suraksha ke saath khilwaad karnaa chhod dijie
 Stop making India weak
 in dinon bahut charchaa chal rahi he or ek swar uth rahaa he
 The country has today lacked Rafale
 hindustan ek swar main kah rahaa he, agar aaj hamaare paas rafel hota to shaayad nateeja isse bhi kuch alag hota
 And let us understand clearly that due to selfishness on Rafale and now politics, the country has suffered a lot
 main in logon ko bahut spasht kahata hum, agar aap modi kaa virodh karnaa chaahate hai to jarur karen, hamaari yojanaon main kamiyaan nikaaliye, unka kya asar ho rahaa he, kya nahin ho rahaa he, isaki bharpoor aalochana kiijie
 It is welcome but do not harm the security interests of the country, the interests of the country
 dhyaan rahe ki modi virodh kii is jid main, aatankwaad ke sargana masood ajahar or hafiz said jaise aatankwaadiyon ko sahaara na mil jaae, unhen takat nahin milani chahie
 Those who ruled the country for many years were interested in just two things - doles (bailouts) and deals (deals)
 is samskruti ne hamaare desh kii vikaas yatra ko bahut nuksaan pahunchaaya
 The people who have suffered the most are our soldiers and farmers
 pehle raksha kshetra kii baat karun
 Why is it that there were so many scams during those years who ruled the country? He started with a jeep and later went on to arms, submarines, helicopters
 is prakriya main raksha kshetra ko baari nuksaan uthaanaa padaa
 If defense deals do not take place, defense arrangements cannot be modernized
 hathiyaar ke sabhi saudagaron se kiski nikatataa, kiski har bicheliye se dosti he? yah baat puraa desh jaanata he or lutiuns dilli to jarur hi jaanati he
 Everyone knows, among the things that our army needs regularly are bullet proof jackets
 2009 main, hamaari force ne 1,86,000 bullate pruf jacket ke liye anurodh kiya
 But a jacket was also not found
 main phir se doharaata hum, 2009 se 2014 tak ek bhi bulatopruf jacket sena ko nahin mili
 During our tenure, we brought in 2,30,000 bullet proof jackets
 hamaare kaarykaal main satta ke galiyare bicheliyon se mukt hai kyonki ve jaanate hai ki yah sarkaar bhrashtachar ko bardaasht nahin karegi
 Now i tell you about the dolls
 satta main rahe logon ko dolls dena bahut pasand tha
 These Dolls were not intended to empower the poor
 ye dol isliye die gaye taaki garib, garib hi rahe or vah rajnatik varg kii dayaa par ashrith rahe
 The best example of this is farm loan waiver
 koi bhi arthshaastri yaa niti visheshgy kabhi nahin kahenge ki rin maafee se hamaari krishi sambandhi mudde hal ho sakate hai
 This may be a good option temporarily
 har 10 saal main upie ek krishi rin maafee ke vichaar ke saath saamne ai
 He did nothing in his entire tenure, but at the last time offered an agricultural loan waiver
 is rin maafee prastaavon main kuch bhi thos nahin tha
 This benefits less than 20 percent of the farmers in the country
 phir bhi ve krishi rin maafee ke mudde par chunaav laduya pasand karte hai
 We have adopted a different approach
 kisaanon ke kalyaan ke liye ek vyapak yojana—pradhanmantri kisaan sammaan nidhi shuru kii
 No dole, no deal, only good work
 bharat ke 12 karod kisaanon ko teen hisson main 6,000 ru
 Will be given is yojana kii ghoshnaa 1 farvari ko hui or 24 farvari ko launch bhi ho gai
 We worked round the clock and launched it in 24 days
 pehle to itnaa samay isi soch-vichaar main laga diya jaataa tha ki is yojana kaa naam ''parivaar ke kis sadsy ke naam par rakhaa janaa chahie?''hamaari anya yojanaayen bhi aisi hi hai, chaahe vah mrudaa swasthya card ho yaa piem krishi sinchai yojana-ye khayraat nahin he
 All these are efforts to increase the income of the farmers
 ye endie sarkaar thi jisane kisaanon ke liye nunatam samarthan mulya main aitihaasik vruddhi kii thi
 When the previous government was in power, a file related to the MSP was kept in abeyance for about seven years
 ve 10 pratishat kamishan ke liye kaam karte the, ham 100 pratishat mishan ke saath kaam karte hai
 And when the government works with a strong mission, all-round development becomes possible
 hamaare 55 maheene or dusron ke 55 saal, donon ke kaamkaaj ke tareekon main do virodhabhasi drushtikon dikh jaaenge
 His approach was a visible approach, our approach is a holistic view
 bharat garibi se jujh rahaa he lekin iske liye unhone bas ek naaraa diyah garibi hataao
 There was no concrete talk on how to remove poverty; Nor did they make any effort to eradicate poverty
 lekin ve jagah-jagah yah kehete gaye ki 'garibi hataao, garibi hataao, garibi hataao
 'they knew that this required India to work on financial inclusion
 iske liye, unhone ek or dikhaawati prayaas kiyah bainkon kaa rashtriyakaran
 They did this in the name of the poor, but no one bothered to find out whether the banks' doors were open to the poor or not
 van rank, van pension
 The 40-year-old demand was kept hanging, but in his last budget in 2014, he gave a token amount of Rs 500 crore for it
 unhen pataa tha ye rakam paryaapt nahin he
 And when was his election issue in the 2014 elections? Will increase the gas cylinder from 9 to 12
 token dene kaa yah tarika hamen sweekaarya nahin he
 All our initiatives set a 100 percent target
 sabhi ke liye vittiya samaveshan or banking suvidha ke liye jan dhan yojana, sabhi ke liye awaas
 
 
 The UPA built 25 lakh houses and we 1
 5 karod ghar ab tak bana chuke hai
 Health care for all - Ayushman Bharat
 koi bhi bhartiya acchhee or sasti swasthya seva se vanchit nahin rahanaa chahie
 Fifty crore Indians will benefit from this scheme
 jabaki ve 9 or 12 silendar ke bich hi uljhe the, hamane ujjwala yojana se karodon pariwaron kii rasoi ko dhuanmukt kar diya he
 There should be electricity for all, electricity in every village and every house
 70 varshon tak andhere main rahane vaale 18,000 gaanvon kaa vidyutikaran kiya gaya he or ab dhyaan gharelu vidyutikaran par he
 So, you can see at what speed and level (speed and scale) we are working
 lekin ajtak achche sawaal poochne ke liye janaa jaataa he, main bhi is manch se kuch sawaal poochna chahta hum
 i believe that these questions will make you think
 aaj tak karodon logon ko khule main shouch ke liye kyon majaboor rakhaa gaya? aaj tak kyon viklangon ke liye sarkaar samvedansheel nahin thi? aaj tak kyon ganga kaa pani itnaa pradooshit tha? aaj tak kyon north-east kii upeksha kii gai? aaj tak kyon desh kii sena ke vir javaanon ke liye neshnal war museum nahin tha? aaj tak nnyon laal kile par aaazaad hind fouj kii yaad main jhanda nahin fahraaya gaya? sachaai he ki pehle garibon vanchiton ko system se jodgaye kii koi koshish nahin kii
 But i have not come here to question only
 kuch jawaab bhi dena chaahunga or wo bhi aapke bina puche
 What have we achieved and what are we achieving? The tagline of your channel is 'fastest', so i thought i should tell the government how fast we are too
 aaj ham sabase tej gati se garibi hataa rahe hai
 Today we are the fastest growing large economy
 aap chaunk jaaenge 1991 se dekhen to hamane pichley paanch saalon main jidipi vikaas sabase tej gati se badhaai he
 We have reduced inflation at the fastest pace since 1991
 aaj desh main sabase tej gati se sadakon kaa nirmaan ho rahaa he
 Railways are developing at the fastest rate

 FDI is coming at the fastest speed

 Just as 'fastest' is your tagline, the fastest is the lifeline of our government
 'mere bharat kii kahaneh ek mahaan desh kaa netritv karte hue maine kya kuch siikhaa'jab main 2013 main yahaan aayaa tha, to maine do doston kii kahani sunai thi
 The story was that once two friends go to the forest

 He wished to walk in the dense forest and left
 achaanak unke saamne ek sher aa gaya
 What do we do now? The guns were left in the car
 wo soch rahe the, kya karen, kahaan jaaen
 But one of them took out his pocket gun license and showed it to the lion
 jab maine wo kahani sunai thi to tatkaaleen sarkaar ke kaam kaa andaaj vahi tha
 At that time, the government made a lot of action but there was no action
 sarkaar main aane ke baad hamane act ke saath acshan bhi kiya
 We are working on making plans as well
 pehle bhi yahi sarkari adhikari the, yahi filein thim, yahi daftar the, lekin parinaam kya tha, sabko pataa he
 Today, you can see at what speed the development work is going on
 2014 se 2019 kaa kalkhand kehane ko to paanch saal kaa he lekin jab aap hamaari sarkaar ke kaamkaaj kaa akalan karenge to lagegaa ki vikaas kii kai dashakon kii yatra kar laute hon
 The time from 2014 to 2019 was the time to fulfill the requirements, but from 2019 onwards there is an opportunity to fulfill the aspirations
 2014 se 2019 buniyadi jaruraton ko har ghar tak pahunchane kaa samay tha lekin 2019 se aage tej unnati ke liye udaan bharne kaa avasar he
 The journey ahead 2014 to 2019 and 2019 is a story of changing dreams
 niraashaa kii sthiti se aashaa ke shikhar tak pahunchane kii kahani he; sankalp se sidghi tak kii kahani he
 Friends, we have read a lot in books that the 21st century will be of India
 paanch varshon kii mehnat se hamane desh kii neenv ko majboot karne kaa kaam kiya he
 The grand building of New India will be built on this foundation

 The latest case is from Punjab where Aam Aadmi Party chief and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal clashed with Punjab Congress leader Captain Amarinder on Twitter to contest elections
 donon netaaon ne ek-duusare par kataaksh kiya
 The case started with the Aam Admi Party in Punjab announcing AAP MLA Jarnail Singh in Delhi against Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal in the election

 On Twitter, the captain wrote that the nomination of Jarnail Singh from Lambi is a testimony of the connivance of the AAP and the Akali Dal and the attempt to win Badal
 Jarnail’s nomination bid from Lambi shows AAP-SAD collusion to ensure Badal’s victory

 harsh ne uthaae the dhoni kii strike rate par sawalpune team ke maalik sanjeev goyanka ke bhai harsh goyanka ke twit ne maahaul ko garmane kaa kaam kiya tha
 Harsh had described Steve Smith as better than Dhoni as captain in his tweet
 itnaa hi nahin unhone ne to dhoni kii strike rate kaa bhi majaak banaaya tha
 Mahendra Singh Dhoni gave a befitting reply to critics, in his typical style, put a full stop on all the criticisms on Saturday
 apni dhansu ballebaaji ke dam par unhone aaj pune team ko sunrisers hyderabad par chah wicket kii yaadgaar jeet dilaa di

 Violence has been a major issue in West Bengal during the Lok Sabha elections
 trinmul congress or bhaajapa donon hi partiyon ne baar-baar ek duusare par rajya main hinsa karwaane kaa aarope lagaaya he
 But even after the election, the Trinamool Congress has questioned the deployment of security forces in the state
 pashchim bengal main adarsh aachaar samhita ke lagu rahane tak kendriya balon kii tainaati kii bhaajapa kii maang par trinmul congress ne aapatti jataai he
 The Trinamool Congress asked the Election Commission on Tuesday, "has a state of emergency been declared in the state
" ’’bataa den ki 22 vipakshi dalon ne nirvachan ayog se mulaakaat kii or agar kisi booth par vivipieti parchiyon kaa milan sahi nahin miltaa to us vidhansabha kshetra ke sabhi matdaan kendron kii vivipieti parchiyon kii ginati kii jaae or unka milan iviem ke nateezon se kiya jaae
 But the Election Commission was not ready for this
 sutron ke mutabik, trinmul congress ke rashtriya pravaktaa or rajyasabha sadsy derek o bryan ne nirvachan ayog ke saamne kendriya balon kii tainaati kaa mudda uthaaya or maang kii ki is par ayog karrwai kare
 According to sources, Derek o'brien told the Election Commission, "the BJP minister announced that the central force would stay in Bengal for another week
" kya bhaajapa ne bengal main apatkaal kii ghoshnaa kar di he? kendriya balon ke chhadam rup main bhaajapa-aresas ke sadsy nagarikon ko pratadit kar rahe hai
 Why special rules for Bengal? It is not acceptable
 ’’gauratlab he ki raksha mantri nirmala sitaraman ne 19 may ko ek samvaadadaata sammelan main kaha tha ki bhaajapa chintit he ki matadaataaon ko daraaya-dhamkaaya gaya or asal matadaataaon ko vot nahin daalane diya gaya
 "to deal with these issues, BJP demands deployment of central security forces in the state till the Model Code of Conduct remains in force," he said
 ’’rajya main 25 may tak aachaar samhita lagu rahegi

 Hindustan has now become the ninth country to initiate a "sex offender register"
 america, britain, canada, australia, newjiland, dakshin africa, ireland tathaa trinidad or tobago pehle hi isaki shuruyaat kar chuke hai
 The National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) now maintains a database containing the names, addresses, fingerprints, DNA samples and Aadhaar numbers of those convicted for sexual offenses
 yah saaf nahin he ki enciarabi aparaadhiyon kii jaankaree apadet kis tarah karne kaa mansuba bana rahaa he or yah jaankaree kya keval kanoon lagu karne vaali agenciyon ko muhaiyaa karai jaaegi
 This register is being introduced as a measure of public safety and there will be a considerable cost on its maintenance
 iske alaava iskaa purv aparaadhiyon par sambhavit asar bhi hoga
 In view of all this, it would be appropriate to investigate the possible importance of such a register
 pehali najar main vah register jo aparaadhiyon or khaskar yon aparaadhon ke sajayaftaa mujarimon par najar rakhane or dobaaraa aparaadh karne waalon kii pahchaan karne or unhen pakadaaey main kanoon lagu karne waalon kii madad karata he, swaagatyogy hi maaloom hota he
 This database can help police verify the history of sexual offenses, although this has been possible to some extent before the Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and System (CCTNS)
 isaki shuruyaat 2009 main hui thi or yah police thanon ke record (giraftaar, exiar, aaropapatr vagairah) ko aapas main jodta he
 When such a register is created, it is believed that the criminal would commit the same crime again and hence there is danger
 haalanki enciarabi kii "krime in india'' report adatan aparaadhiyon or khaskar yon aparaadhon ke liye doshi tehraae gaye mujarimon par nigaah nahin rakhti
 Therefore, it is not known how big a convicted sexual offender is
 is registry ke asardaar hone ke liye jaruri he ki maamalon main dosha sabit kiye jaaen
 Also because more than 90 percent of sexual offenses are not reported in the country
 jo yon aparaadh report kiye jate hai or aapraadhik nyaay pranali main daakhil hote hai, ve bhi intahaai deree (enciarabi 2016 balaatkaar ke 88 fisadi maamle lambit bataati he), bahut kam sajaa dar (26 fisadi) or peedit mahilaon ke adaalaton main aksar "mukarne'' sareekhee pareshaaniyon main fanse rahete hai
 These statistics show that most of the sexual offenses in the country are not noticed and many criminals do not have to face any action
 yon aparaadhiyon kaa register banane par jor "ajanabi khatre'' ke afsane ko bhi aage badhaata he, baavjood iske ki maujuud aankadon se ham jaanate hai ki balaatkaar peedit 94 fisadi mahilaayein apane aparaadhiyon kii parichit hoti hai (enciarabi 2016)
 These criminals are often neighbors, relatives, teachers, partners: and are usually not unknown people hovering in the dark
 bahut kam sajaa dar, sajaa main deree or dobaaraa aparaadh karne ke gaiyr-dastaveji jokhim ke saath yah saaf nahin he ki yon aparaadhiyon kaa register yon aparaadhon par lagaam kasne main yaa nae aparaadhon kii jaanch main kitna kargar hoga
 The Sunil Rastogi case, which came up in 2017 in New Delhi, puts this difficulty to the fore
 is cese ke baad hi yon aparaadhiyon ke register kii maang ne jor pakadaa tha
 In this, the culprit was accused of molesting the child and he confessed to sexually assaulting more than 500 children during 12 years
 aage kii jaanch se pataa chalaa ki us par yon hamale ke aarope pehle (2006 main) bhi sabit ho chuke the or chah maheene kii jail kii sajaa bhi mil chuki thi
 Union Minister for Women and Child Welfare Maneka Gandhi took this opportunity and demanded registration of sex offenders
 daleel yah thi ki isse kuch hamalon ko roka ja saktaa tha
 But this optimism is completely baseless because the register does not prevent crimes
 iske bajaae yah samay is baat par vichaar karne kaa he ki saikadon maamle darj kyon nahin hote hai or jab darj hote bhi hai to ansulajhe kyon rah jate hai
 The case of child sex offender Sunil Rastogi does not justify making a register of sex offenders, instead it defines the shortcomings and shortcomings of our child protection system at the ground level, the pathetic investigative machinery and our penal justice system in responding properly to these crimes
 Keeps it out
 khule or band registeraise registeron ko aajamaa chuke deshon ke pramaan bhi asal main anukool nahin hai
 For example, America has the longest record of using the Sex Offender Register
 magar hindustan ke ulat, jahaan yah register saarvajanik taur par sulabh nahin hoga, america main yah register ek saarvajanik adhisuchana pranali par khule aam maujuud he
 a study assessing the effects of the introduction of the sex offenders register in the state of New Jersey concluded that it did not reduce or decrease the number of repeat arrests for sex offenses
 duusari taraf aise register ke rakrakhaav kii laagat acchhee-khaasi thi or vah badhati ja rahi thi
 Due to being registered in this register in the US, the former criminals face heavy restrictions and even finding a good job for them becomes very difficult
 unhen aksar saamaajik bahishkaar or utpeeda kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 In fact, the ill effects of living with your name on this register are so horrifying that studies show that repeat crime rates rose as a result after the register was publicly named
 ek adhyayan is nattejey par pahunchataa he ki register main naam aane bhar se aparaadh kii dar main thodi (1
 1 per cent), but after putting it on the public notification system "when their information was provided openly, the likelihood of criminals committing a crime increased further because of the psychological, social or financial costs associated with the crime
" Makes it more attractive
 '' (jeje prescot and rock of, 2011)
 In contrast, the UK Sex Offenses Register was introduced in 1997 as a closed system
 alabatta 2008 main bal yon apradhi khulaasa yojana shuru kii gai jisamen bacchon ke mata-pita, dekhbhaal karne vaale or gargian poochtacha kar sakate hai ki ek vyakti vishesh bal yon aparaadh kaa sajayaftaa rahaa he yaa nahin
 Similar conditional open systems are prevalent in South Africa and in parts of Australia
 badakismati se in deshon main gaiyr-saarvajanik registeron ke prabhavi hone ko lekar koi bade adhyayan nahin hai
 DNA data and privacy issues Another concern about these registers is the privacy of the people registered in the register, who have little sympathy
 america main saarvajanik adhisuchana ke bheeshan ulat nateezon ko dekhte hue is baat kii asal or jaij ashanka he ki register kaa data hack or li hone par purv apradhi bheed ke haathon insaaf yaa saamaajik bahishkaar ke shikaar ho jaaen
 In addition, their chances of getting better employment are severely limited and thus they may be pushed back into a life of crime
 bharat main is register kaa ek dilachasp pahalu isamen diene data ko shaamil karnaa he
 Hopefully, this will help solve cases in which repeat offenses are suspected
 vichaaradhin diene praudyogiki (upyog evam anuprayog) viniman vidheyak 2018 main aparaadh kii ek alag shrenee ke saath diene bank kii sthapana kaa praavdhaan bhi kiya gaya he
 The inclusion of DNA data is critical to the recent arrest of the "golden State Killer" in the US
 is mujrim par aarope he ki usne 1970 or 80 ke dashakon main 13 hatyaein, 50 balaatkaar, sau se zyada choriyaan kii thim or takreeban 30 varshon tak police ko chakma detaa rahaa
 It was a great success of the investigation that he was caught after mixing the DNA found on the occasion with a private genetic website equipped with thousands of users' genetic information
 ye kamyaabiyaan aparaadhon kii jaanch main diene kii jaankaree ke istemaal kii sambhaavnaaen badhaati hai
 However, there are very few cases and there should not be much hope for their possible use in India because we have only six central forensic laboratories and 31 state laboratories and over 12,000 cases of sexual assaults are currently awaiting results in these central laboratories

 hamen yon aparaadhon kii rokthaam kii vyavasthaaon or unke mul kaarnon se mukhaatib hone ke liye lambey vakt kii yojanaon kii jarurat he
 The increasing public pressure to address security concerns must be dealt with at its root, rather than deviating measures like registering, which can only give a false sense of security

 manki ko metro pasand he, ye na to ye koi nayaa gaanaa he or na hi koi jumala
 But, the metro love of monkeys is definitely creating a new idiom
 metro ke andar bandar kaa ek nayaa maamla saamana aayaa he
 The incident is of the Kashmiri gate-faridabad metro line
 woilet line ke bata chowk stesan ke paas ek baari bharkam bandar metro ke andar ghus aayaa
 The rest of the people, who are traveling with this new passenger of the metro, are surprised as well as scared and that the monkey does not attack any passenger
 lekin, bandar ne bhi jaise metro ke kaayade kanoon sikh rakhe the, bandar ek coach ko paar karte hue duusare coach main badi shaan se ghumta rahaa, lekin kisi ko nuksaan nahin pahuchaya
 Meanwhile, a traveler made a video of the monkey roaming inside the metro, in which the monkey is seen pleasantly
 duusari ore dilli metro rail corporation limited ke adhikariyon ne is tarah kii kisi bhi ghatana kii jaankaree hone se inkaar kiya he
 According to DMRC officials, in recent days, there is no information about any incident of monkey being inside the metro in Faridabad
 haalanki ye koi pehla maamla nahin he jab bandar metro kii sawari karte hue camere main kaid hua ho
 Even before this, there have been many such incidents when the monkey not only entered the metro but also created a huge explosion quartet
 iske pehle ek baar rithala metro stesan par bhi bandar metro ke andar ghus aayaa tha or usne yatriyon kaa saamaan tak chin liya tha
 According to a DMRC official, there are many stations in the metro around which monkeys are found in large numbers
 aksar aisi ghatnaayen metro ke shuruaati yaa aakhri stesan par hoti he, jahaan train khaali hoti he or zyada der tak khadi rahati he
 In such a situation, the monkeys sneak inside in search of food and after closing the door they reach the next station

 Baba Ramdev said in Ujjain that the way Kasab was hanged, made him a hero and like Shahid Bhagat Singh was secretly trapped, Kasab was to be hanged openly

 This is not the way a cricket bottle of champagne is opened and girls are danced

 Due to the CAG, the credibility of the Congress has come down to zero

 Kasab was hanged in such a way as was given to Shaheed Bhagat Sing, which made the government kneel before the terrorists

 Like Mahendra Singh Dhoni, no captain can hope to escape his post after clinching two consecutive Test series on foreign soil but despite facing two whitewashes in Australia and England within 9 months, Dhoni has emerged stronger in the team
 dhoni kii captaini main bharat ne videshi sarajameen par lagaataar saat test ganvaae hai jisamen se chaar main team ko pari kii haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa jabaki ek main 300 se adhik ranon se haar jhelni padi
 Two other matches the team lost by 196 and 122 runs
 bhartiya captain kii swayan kii ballebaaji bhi kaaphi prabhavi nahin rahi
 He 31 in eight innings in England
 43 kii ausat se 220 ran hi bana paae jabaki austrailia main teen test kii chah pariyon main unhone 20
 Only 102 runs at an extremely poor average of 42
 austrailia main haalanki dhoni ne chaar maichon main se sirf teen main captaini kii jabaki dhimi over gati ke kaaran un par pratibandh lagane parvirendra sahvaagne captaini kii thi lekin is match main bhi bharat ko haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 Dhoni however still retains his position due to his past achievements
 team ne unki aguai main do vishwa khitaab jite hai or kai karname pehali baar kiye jisamen austrailia main ekadivasiy shrinkhalaa jeetna bhi shaamil he
 Apart from this, no strong option is available to Dhoni at the moment

 Sourav Ganguly's numerous achievements on foreign soil proved meaningless when he clashed with coach Greg Chappell in 2005 and was overtaken by the Australian coach
 bharat kii vishwa champion team ke captain rahe kapil dev ko bhi 1987 vishwa cap ke semifinal main bharat kii haar ke baad captaini ganvaani padi thi
 His predecessor Sunil Gavaskar had to relinquish the captaincy after a 3–0 defeat against Pakistan in the early 1980s
 antarrashtriya str par bhi bahut kam captain is tarah kii sharmnaak haar ke baavjood captaini bachaane main safal rahe hai
 Ricky Ponting was given the one-day captaincy following the team's defeat in the 2011 World Cup, while the team he led had won the last two World Cups
 ponting ko isse pehle varsh 2000 main steve vaa kii jagah captain banaaya gaya tha jinhone austrailia ko sheersh par pahunchane main ahm bhoomika nibhaai thi
 Viv Richders did not lose a series as captain, and under his leadership the team won 27 of 50 Tests, but was forced to retire despite Ritchie Richardson being given command of the team
 pakistan main captainon ko unke pad se hataaya janaa badi baat nahin he
 Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis were repeatedly replaced as captains in the 1990s
 england main bhi yahi silsilaa dekhne ko mila
 Michael Vann led the Ashes to England in 2005 and captained the team for five years

 The BJP is going through a duel of 'new face who' these days
 yahi vajah he ki party kii duusari pankti ke netaaon main ghamaasan machaa hua he or vah khud ko sthapit karne main lage hue hai
 While the party is trying to bring forward Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi in support of fundamentalist ideology, on the other hand, the image of Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan is being tried to shine at the national level
 agle chunaav main varisht netaa laalkrishna adwani kii bhoomika kya hogi yah ab tak aupchaarik rup se spasht nahin hui he baavjood iske bhavi daavedaaron main aas bani hui hi he
 The Chief Minister of Gujarat, Modi, does not miss any opportunity to show his stature and he himself gives rise to the debate of the 'future Prime Minister' by jumping his name in his own way and in the mouth of his loved ones
 yah baat digar he ki modi kaa naam aate hi rashtriya janatantric gathbandhan (rajg) kaa pramukh ghatak janata dal (united) ankhen tarerane laga he
 After the dispute between the allies of BJP over the future Prime Minister, efforts have started to create a national image of Shivraj from Madhya Pradesh

 Senior journalist Girja Shankar is of the opinion that the government machinery continues to experiment in various ways to propagate its achievements, one of them is 'the MP Bulletin' published in English
 har sarkaar kii koshish hoti he ki uske dwaara kiye ja rahe kaamon kii jaankaree sabhi tak pahunche
 At the same time, governments have an internal desire to reach Delhi, the efforts of the state government are also part of this internal desire

 The book is being distributed across the state through officers

 Earlier, BJP leaders have been objecting to the lack of photographs of their leaders in hoardings showing the development of Punjab across the state, but now the minister has been openly exposed to the bjp's quota in the government due to the disappearance of photos of himself and his party's big faces from this booklet
 Are registering their objections and reminding their ally Akali Dal of coalition religion
 punjabasarkaar main bijepi ke cote se cabinet mantri anil joshi ne is par aapatti jataate hue kaha ki bijepi netaaon kii photo honi hi chahie thi
 At least, we would have put a photo of PM Modi in the hoardings depicting the development in the cities
 punjabi main kareeb 20 lakh, hindi main 4 lakh or english main 1 lakh bocolate chhapavai gai hai
 In this, four photographs of CM Prakash Singh Badal, five pictures of Deputy CM Sukhbir Singh Badal and photographs of other Akali Dal ministers have also been printed showing the progress of different departments, but the BJP has neither a name nor their ministers
 There is mention of work
 vahiin is saare vivaad par punjab ke dipti siem sukhbir singh badal kaa kahana he ki ye kisi party ke prachaar kii bocolate nahin he, balki punjab sarkaar ke kaam kaa lekha-jokha he or jaise pradhanmantri narendra modi bharat sarkaar kaa cheharaa hai, vaise hi mukhyamantri prakaash singh badal punjab sarkaar kaa cheharaa hai
 That is why his face has been given priority over the booklet and there is no dispute about this booklet
 punjab sarkaar ke sarkari kaaryakramon main lagane vaale postaron or hordings main pehle bhi bijepi kii bajaae akali dal ke mantri or netaaon ko tarjeeh di jaati he or bijepi ke mantri or netaa kai baar apane varisht netaaon ke saamne is baat kaa virodh darj karvaa chuke hai, lekin chunaav se thik pehle jari is bocolate ko lekar bijepi netaaon kii naaraazgi khulkar saamne aa gai he or gathbandhan main baithi donon hi partiyon kii tanatani bhi jagajaahir ho gai he
 Reserve Bank of India Governor Urjit Patel has told the Public Account Committee of Parliament that he is trying to reduce the cost of digital payments in the country
 notebandi ke baad aam aadmi ko cash kii killat se bachaane ke liye kendra sarkaar ne desh main digital pement ko badhaava dene kaa vikalp chunaa
 Urjit Patel as well as all the deputy governors of the Reserve Bank met the Public Account Committee of Parliament

 Technology has to be resorted to to complete digital transactions

 At the same time, digital transactions for shopping from a shop are taken out of the shopkeeper's pocket
 iske alaava kisi digital tranjaction ko puraa karne ke liye kanjumar ko bhi internet bankig, mobile bankig jaisi anya sevaaon ko istemaal karne ke liye ek cost adaa kerani padati he
 The RBI asked the PAC these questions
 Last week, the Public Accounts Committee of Parliament asked the Reserve Bank and the Ministry of Finance what steps they were taking to reduce the problems faced by the common man in the country after demonetisation
 PAC kii aapattinotbandi ke faisle par gambhir tippanee karte hue samiti ne kaha tha ki jis desh main kol drops ek gambhir samasya he vahaan sarkaar kaise puure desh ko cashles vyavastha par le ja sakati he
 The Public Accounts Committee reviews the reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) in the country and can comment on necessary matters
 samiti ke mutabik pradhanmantri 50 din main sthiti ko saamaanya karne ke vaade par khare nahin utre hai
 Therefore, the important question was whether the Central Government had decided to ban with incomplete preparation
 or ab iske gambhir parinaam arthvyavastha ke saamne hai
 Chief Minister of Telangana and Chairman of Telangana Rashtra Samithi
 chandrashekhar raav (kesiar) ne vaidic mantroccharan ke saath 80 hajaar karod ke kaleshwaram lift sinchai pariyojna (KLIP) kaa udghaatan kiya
 During this period Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy and Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis were present, but kcr's nephew and former Irrigation Minister Harish Rao remained absent
 iske baad se kesiar or unke parivaar main daraar padane kii atakalein lagaai ja rahi hai
 Kaleswaram lift irrigation project is the largest irrigation project in the world
 pariyojna ke tahat godavari nadi kaa 283 hajaar million cubic pani sinchai or pine ke istemaal main laayaa ja sakegaa
 This will provide irrigation and drinking water to 13 districts of Telangana
 is project kii shuruyaat teen saal pehle yani saal 2016 main hui thi
 Harish Rao has played an important role in the implementation of the Kaleswaram lift irrigation project
 aise main harish raav kii gairmaujuudagi kii raajnneetik galiyare main jorshor se charchaa ho rahi he
 He also did not attend the luncheon held in Jaishankar Bhupalpally district
 aapako bataa den ki harish raav tiares ke pramukh kesiar ke bhattije hai
 He played an active role in the agitation for the demand of Telangana state
 kesiar ke bhattije harish ravaraajnneetik galiyaaron main charchaa he ki kesiar apane bete keti ramarao ko aage laana chaahate hai or apni raajnneetik viraasat va party kaa uttaradhikari bananaa chaahate hai
 Due to this, he wants to sideline his nephew Harish Rao
 isse pehle keti ramarao ko party kaa kaaryvahak adhyaksh banaaya ja chukaa he, jabaki vidhansabha chunaav main harish raav ko koi tavajjon nahin diya gaya
 Let me tell you that in December last year, Telangana assembly elections were held, in which TRS won a landslide victory
 tiares ke ek netaa ne naam na chhapane kii shart par bataaya ki kesiar ke kaleshwaram project ke liye harish raav ne din raat ek kar diya tha
 Harish Rao worked on the ground for its implementation
 philhal harish raav siddeepet se vidhayak hai
 When KCR was inaugurating the world's largest irrigation project, he was participating in the International Yoga Day program organized in his district

 Let us tell you that this project has been prepared in collaboration with Megha Engineering and Infrastructure Limited (MEIL) and BHEL at a cost of 80 thousand crore rupees
 yoga ke dam par kai log saansen roak lete hai to koi bhukh or pyaas ko niyantrit karne kaa daawa karata he
 Many such things have been mentioned in the ancient texts that it is said that the great siddha men used to do such things on the basis of yoga, which was not available to everyone
 lekin aaj ke aadhunik samay main kya in baton par vishwaas kiya jaataa he
 Can a person walk on water with yoga practice
 aap bhi soch rahe honge ki ye to bilkul sambhav nahi he
 But on the basis of yoga, claimed to have walked on water, a Chinese Buddhist monk named Xi Liliong
 unhone is daawey ko sahi sabit karne ke liye kai saikadon ke logon ke saamne video bhi banwaaya he
 This video of Xi Liliong, associated with the Shaolin Buddhist Monastery of China, is going viral all over the world
 aap video main dekh sakate hai ki vah pani main aise daud rahe hai maano koi sadak par daud rahaa he
 Liliong has covered 125 meters in it
 unhone 5 meter tak daudane kaa apana hi record todaa he
 However, some people have also commented that they have used water placards for their running
 lekin agar aap video ko dhyaan se dekhenge to paaenge ki yah takhtiyaan itani halki hai pair rakhte hi pani main dub jaati hai
 The comments ham daawey se nahin kah sakate hai ki shi lilyong ke is karishme ke peeche yoga kii takat he yaa phir kisi takneekee kaa istemaal kiya gaya he
 But of course, whoever is watching this video is surprised
 yah video do saal purana he or yah soshal media main khub dekha ja rahaa he

 police ke mutabik laash kaa keval sharir ke neeche kaa aadha hissaa hi mila he, jabaki baaki ghad or sir kaa hissaa gaayab he
 In the initial investigation, the police believe that by looking at the clothes tied to the corpse, it is clear that this girl belongs to a big family and for some reason she has been killed and her body has been cut into several parts in a planned manner
