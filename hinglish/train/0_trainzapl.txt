 kya yah zaruri he ki mumbai yaa kolkata yaa america main kaamyaab hone ke baad marwari bijnesaman yaa enarai rajasthan main bhi nivesh karegaa
 Should a Gujarati businessman be reminded that you are from Gujarat and you can even put up a factory there or if you start inviting them by dividing the business community in Telangana vs Andhra, then what will be the image of the businessman within the country or the states due to this Will there be a tension between the two states, which will be a competition between rajyon ke bich pratiyogita sukhad sanket he, lekin is pratiyogita kaa aadhaar kya he, yah zarur dekha janaa chahie

 On 20 April, the Hindu newspaper wrote in reference to Vasundhara Raje Scindia's visit to Kolkata that there is a possibility of meeting the Marwari businessman along with the business world
 vasundhara raaje sindhiya or unke sahyogi in dinon risergent rajasthan ke liye alag-alag rajyon main rajasthan ke bijness anukool maahaul kaa prachaar karne ke liye ja rahe hai
 There was no mention of meeting the Marwari businessman on the site of Resurgent Rajasthan, but it is not right to mention in the news in this way or to specifically call or address people of a region or caste culture in the name of an industry conference

 pichley saal gujarat kii mukhyamantri anandiben patel bhi mumbai daure par gai thim
 While addressing the business world in English, suddenly Gujarati started speaking
 indian express kii report ke anusaar anandiben patel ne kaha ki jab narendra bhai america main hindi bol sakate hai to main mumbai main gujarati bol hi sakati hum
 Of course, we should speak, but if the purpose of speaking is that she wants to promote the neighborhood identity in a professional community, then there can be a problem
 isi kram main aaj ke indian express main khabar chhapi he ki andhra pradesh ke mukhyamantri chandrababu naidu ke bete en lokesh naidu or telugana ke mukhyamantri ke chandrashekhar raav ke bete ke tii ramarao in dinon america main hai
 The state is divided and the nris residing in America have also been divided and on this basis, competition between the two has been fought in order to woo them
 lokesh naidu california main hai or ramarao neuyark main
 Chandrababu Naidu's son is not a representative of the government, yet on behalf of the Chief Minister has gone to improve relations with the Andhra community in America
 america main rah rahe andhra pradesh ke enarai kii ek sabha main bhaag lenge or nivesh ke liye apil bhi karenge
 In Las Angeles, Lokesh also took out an exhibition with 100 limousine cars in the name of Smart Village - Smart Ward and appealed to the local community to adopt one village each
 indian express kii report main aisa hi likhaa he
 Rama Rao will also meet the NRI of Telangana
 ek lihaaz se isamen kisi ko buraai na dikhe, lekin jab yah ati ke str par dikhne lagegaa to samasya hogi
 It is a kind of licentiousness and cultural opportunism that increases your usefulness for that state only when money comes or becomes successful in an outside country or state
 bhashaa or samskruti ke aadhaar par kisi ke nivesh karne kii kshamta kaa moolyankan kiya ja rahaa he
 Certainly, these so-called successful nris made success in America only because of the open environment there, otherwise they would not have to leave Andhra Pradesh
 aajkal har raajnneetik dal ke liye ye enarai bijasanesaman mahatvapurn ho gaye hai
 No one knows the change in the state's economy due to these, but in the name of wooing them, the state is spending a lot of money to influence voters in their respective areas
 nivesh kaa avasar sabake liye hota he to ise tatasth tareeke se hi kiya janaa chahie
 Otherwise a Chief Minister will be praised in the country, but the imbalance of development in other states will continue
 is lihaaz se koi bihar yaa upi main nivesh karne hi nahin aayega
 By the way, this also means that the success of these communities has stood on the basis of such a network from the past to the present day
 jise kai baar ham sirf peshewar kamyaabi maan lete hai
 If it is so that their success is due to Gujarati, Marathi or Rajasthani network, then this regionalism of business will only increase the area imbalance
 unki nishtha india ke naam par apane rajya bhar tak hi simit rah jaaegi
 Chief ministers sitting in constitutional posts should not spread such businessism on community basis
 ateet main is aadhaar par kai baar hinsak asantosh ubhar chukaa he
 Such competition will further incite such dissatisfaction
 is lihaaz se to koi bihar, upi or urisa main nivesh hi nahin karegaa
 Business captains should respect only equal and better opportunity, not on the basis of caste and locality
 unhen is tarah kii baithkon kaa bahishkaar karnaa chahie
 The comments enarai ke naam par videshon or anya rajyon main ban rahaa yah network bijness samskruti ke khilaaf he
 These events also show that no chief minister has more than an idea to call someone
 sabaki daavedaari yahi he ki hamane ye niyam bana die hai, hamaare yahaan ye he or wo he
 Business is not spread by calling someone from somewhere
 bijness failata he samay or bazaar kii zarurat ke aadhaar par
 Leaders feel that by opening a counter and creating an atmosphere, their image becomes that of a business brother
 shaayad ban bhi jaati he
 That is why the politics of the current era is trying to remind these global citizens who believe in the business and the country that they also have a local past
 vah local ateet he unka us rajya se sambandh, jahaan se ve nikalakar duusare rajya yaa desh main apana bijness samrajya khadaa karte hai
 Even if they have not been born in that state in the near past, they are declared citizens of that state in the name of origin of their language and culture
 yah bijness jagat kaa nayaa jatvaad he, jise kshetravaad ke naam par ubhaara ja rahaa he
 There is no need to be overly apprehensive, but there is nothing wrong in being cautious

 Of course, we should speak, but if the purpose of speaking is that she wants to promote the neighborhood identity in a professional community, then there can be a problem
 isi kram main aaj ke indian express main khabar chhapi he ki andhra pradesh ke mukhyamantri chandrababu naidu ke bete en lokesh naidu or telugana ke mukhyamantri ke chandrashekhar raav ke bete ke tii ramarao in dinon america main hai
 The state is divided and the nris residing in America have also been divided and on this basis, competition between the two has been fought in order to woo them
 lokesh naidu california main hai or ramarao neuyark main
 Chandrababu Naidu's son is not a representative of the government, yet on behalf of the Chief Minister has gone to improve relations with the Andhra community in America
 america main rah rahe andhra pradesh ke enarai kii ek sabha main bhaag lenge or nivesh ke liye apil bhi karenge
 In Las Angeles, Lokesh also took out an exhibition with 100 limousine cars in the name of Smart Village - Smart Ward and appealed to the local community to adopt one village each
 indian express kii report main aisa hi likhaa he
 Rama Rao will also meet the NRI of Telangana
 ek lihaaz se isamen kisi ko buraai na dikhe, lekin jab yah ati ke str par dikhne lagegaa to samasya hogi
 It is a kind of licentiousness and cultural opportunism that increases your usefulness for that state only when money comes or becomes successful in an outside country or state
 bhashaa or samskruti ke aadhaar par kisi ke nivesh karne kii kshamta kaa moolyankan kiya ja rahaa he
 Certainly, these so-called successful nris made success in America only because of the open environment there, otherwise they would not have to leave Andhra Pradesh
 aajkal har raajnneetik dal ke liye ye enarai bijasanesaman mahatvapurn ho gaye hai
 No one knows the change in the state's economy due to these, but in the name of wooing them, the state is spending a lot of money to influence voters in their respective areas
 nivesh kaa avasar sabake liye hota he to ise tatasth tareeke se hi kiya janaa chahie
 Otherwise a Chief Minister will be praised in the country, but the imbalance of development in other states will continue
 is lihaaz se koi bihar yaa upi main nivesh karne hi nahin aayega
 By the way, this also means that the success of these communities has stood on the basis of such a network from the past to the present day
 jise kai baar ham sirf peshewar kamyaabi maan lete hai
 If it is so that their success is due to Gujarati, Marathi or Rajasthani network, then this regionalism of business will only increase the area imbalance
 unki nishtha india ke naam par apane rajya bhar tak hi simit rah jaaegi
 Chief ministers sitting in constitutional posts should not spread such businessism on community basis
 ateet main is aadhaar par kai baar hinsak asantosh ubhar chukaa he
 Such competition will further incite such dissatisfaction
 is lihaaz se to koi bihar, upi or urisa main nivesh hi nahin karegaa
 Business captains should respect only equal and better opportunity, not on the basis of caste and locality
 unhen is tarah kii baithkon kaa bahishkaar karnaa chahie
 The comments enarai ke naam par videshon or anya rajyon main ban rahaa yah network bijness samskruti ke khilaaf he
 These events also show that no chief minister has more than an idea to call someone
 sabaki daavedaari yahi he ki hamane ye niyam bana die hai, hamaare yahaan ye he or wo he
 Business is not spread by calling someone from somewhere
 bijness failata he samay or bazaar kii zarurat ke aadhaar par
 Leaders feel that by opening a counter and creating an atmosphere, their image becomes that of a business brother
 shaayad ban bhi jaati he
 That is why the politics of the current era is trying to remind these global citizens who believe in the business and the country that they also have a local past
 vah local ateet he unka us rajya se sambandh, jahaan se ve nikalakar duusare rajya yaa desh main apana bijness samrajya khadaa karte hai
 Even if they have not been born in that state in the near past, they are declared citizens of that state in the name of origin of their language and culture
 yah bijness jagat kaa nayaa jatvaad he, jise kshetravaad ke naam par ubhaara ja rahaa he
 There is no need to be overly apprehensive, but there is nothing wrong in being cautious

 Our cameraperson captured the smoke from the camera
 hamaare gaja chhodane se pehle yah khabar enditivi par dikhaai gai or hamaari website par bhi laga di gai
 Hamas never accepts the news of its rocket being fired, but the way casualties caused by attacks by Israel were necessary to show the people of Gaza, it was equally important to show how Hamas itself was among the city's dense population Rocket rocket from pakistan ke supreme court ke saman ke ulanghan or lagaataar duusare din iske samaksh purv sainya shaasha parvej musharraf ke aaj pesh nahin hone ke baad chif justise iftikhar mohammad choudhary ne kaha he ki purv raashtrapati par sansad main deshadroh kaa maamla chalaaya ja saktaa he

 The Supreme Court had summoned the former President of Pakistan to explain the reasons why he imposed Emergency in the country in 2007 and why he dismissed more than 60 judges

 i would just like to mention here that 26 / 11 is a sad incident in our country, which cannot be put in the field of entertainment, and i think it would be wrong to weigh the film made on this attack in the rating scales, so i can No one wants to give a rating
 
 
 aap jaaie, film dekhie
 
 
 No matter how you feel about the film, you will definitely get some information about how the people of Mumbai and the police were facing the biggest terrorist attack of the country during 26 / 11

 shah ne kaha ki congress kaa ye twit nakaaratmakataa ko darshata he
 Today, her negativity was seen supporting the first three divorces
 iske baad rahul gandhi ne yoga diwas kaa majaak banaaya or hamaari sena kaa apmaan kiya
 With this, Shah hoped for positivity and said that the spirit of positivity will awaken and help overcome difficult challenges
 Congress stands for negativity
 Today, their negativity was seen in their clear support to the medieval practice of Triple Talaq
 Now, they mock Yoga Day and insult our forces (yet again!)hoping the spirit of positivity will prevail

 One of the ambitious schemes of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has seen many cases of messing up with skill development
 jhuthe certificate or naamon sebsidika paisa dallalon ke paas pahunch rahaa he
 Through skill development, Prime Minister Modi's dream is that the youth of the country are trained in vocational subjects and create employment
 iske liye sarkaar ne baari bharkam bajet bhi rakhaa he, lekin aaj tak kii team ne jab jamini str par jaanch padtaal shuru kii to pataa chalaa ki jhuthe certificate or naamon se sabsidi kaa paisa dallalon dwaara khaaya ja rahaa he
 Prime Minister Modi's ambitious skill development scheme was launched in July 2015 to target 40 crore people
 iske jariye saal 2022 tak desh ke kareeb 40 karod logon corogaradene kaa lakshya rakhaa gaya
 Whether it is ministries or all ngos or private companies, they aim to achieve this goal of skill development by 2022
 kaushal vikaas yojana kaa makasad bade paimaane par logon ko teji ke saath ucch paimaane par vyavsaayik prashikshan muhaiyaa karana he taaki agle dashak tak desh duniya ke sabase bade rojgaar vaale desh ke rup main taiyaar ho sake, lekin jab aaj tak ne skill india mishan se judaa hua kapadaa mantralay ke integrated skill dawalpment skim kii jaanch padtaal shuru kii to paaya ki is kaarykram ke raste main kai sawaal pathar banakar khadey hai
 It also needs to be noted here that the Integrated Skill Development Scheme (ISDS) project of the Ministry of Textiles runs on the Public Private Partnership ie PPP model
 isamen kaam karne vaali agenciyon ko prati ummidavaar das hajaar rupee kii tay raashi kii 75 fisadi sarkari sabsidi milti he, lekin hamane jab jaanch padtaal shuru kii to pataa chalaa ki jinako phayda milanaa tha, unamem se kuch log bhrasht bichauliyon ke dhokhe kaa shikaar hue
 After the whole issue of disturbances in the scheme, Skill Development Minister Dharmendra Pradhan says that the whole matter will be investigated

 Without training certificate, we tried to find out the list of beneficiaries under ISD scheme in Chaukin Purva, a remote village of Bundelkhand area of uttar Pradesh
 sarkari yojanaon main jinka naam he, unamem se teen logon kii hamane nishandehi kii
 ISDS records Tara Chandra is a trained tailor who has undergone sewing training at the Modern Education Society
 iske liye unhen kapadaa mantralay kii ore se 23 sitambar, 2017 ko certificate (number 17210867803) bhi diya gaya, jabaki khud tara chandra kaa kahana he ki wo kabhi bhi us centre par gaye hi nahin
 Apart from Tara Chandra, Rakesh has also received a certificate (conduit number 1507398) issued by the Ministry of Textiles for training in tailoring
 aisads kii website par 5 farvari 2018 ko rakesh ko rojgaar paane waalon main dikhaaya gaya he or wo bhi maheene kii 6500 rupee kii kamai par, lekin khud rakesh kaa kahana he ki wo kisi training ke liye kabhi gaye hi nahin
 The same is the case with Anita Devi, who was given a certificate (number 17210867810) issued on 23 September 2017
 inkaa bhi namaisdske phydemand logon kii suchi main shaamil he
 The same condition of the other village also showed the same mess in another nearby village of Purva
 is gaanv ke ramanuj ko bhi aisads ke tahat darji hone kaa certificate mil gaya he
 He has been given certificate (number 17130665810) from MAEER, Maharashtra
 lekin ramanuj ko pataa hi nahin he ki 2016 main maharashtra academy of ejineering and ajukational research yani MAEER se usko training di ja chuki he kyonki wo kabhi vahaan gaye hi nahin
 When asked about the program, he told that a middleman named Chedilal cheated him
 ramanuj kaa aarope he ki usadlaalane sarkari training kaa jhootha vaada karke unka aadhaar card tak le liya tha
 When the truth of Ramanuj's allegations was investigated at the Maharashtra Academy of Engineering and Educational Research office in Pune, its co-ordinating officer Mahesh Deshpande claimed that the program was conducted as per government rules
 sarkari jaanch kii jaruratmahesh deshpandey is ghotaale se saaf-saaf inkaar kar gaye, lekin ajtak ke paas jo dastavej or logon ke bayaan hai, wo bataate hai ki gadabadiyaan hui hai or isamen sarkari jaanch kii jarurat he
 The youth who were given training and certificate to make them skillful, they do not know about it
 yah sab kaagaj par hua or bichauliye sarkari sabsidi uda le gaye
 In such a situation, the question arises that even private companies and institutes that implement the government's schemes are not found in it

 His NGO, Al Fiza, provides vocational training to the marginalized-disadvantaged community

 Zainab started training class after the RTI revelations
 unako lagata tha ki sarkaar kii taraf se pryojit ye ek bharosemand skim he
 Everything went well in the initial phase, but the hour of his distress came when the Inspectors of Modern Education Society suddenly stopped coming to his NGO
 tab jainab ne kaarykram ke bare main jaankaree ke liye ek artiai file kii jisamen mili jawaab ne unako hilaakar rakh diya
 On August 23, 2018, a reply sent by RTI revealed that 146 women had already received training from their NGO
 itnaa hi nahin, unamem 95 mahilaon ko to kaam bhi mil gaya
 According to Zainab, those who took training here did not get any course certificate, nor were they paid for conducting that program
 lekin artiai se pataa chalaa ki mantralay ne alag-alag jagahon par aisads course ke chalaane ke liye sonipat ke modern ajukeshan sosayadi ko bhugtan bhi kar diya or wo bhi ek karod 12 lakh rupee kii baari bharkam rakam raashi
 20-year-old Shabnam's name is also recorded in the tailoring course at Zainab's center, but neither she got diploma certificate nor any work, while the RTI reply showed that a long list of candidates can get jobs in big companies

 What should be the position of an ideal election that only the percentage of voting should be increased, be proud of it or leave worrying about the percentage and participate in understanding the issues
 iske liye saadhan kya hai, bhaashan vigyaapan, ghoshnaptr yaa media
 Should we avoid voting in the absence of sufficient information? yah sahi nahin he ki hamaara matadaata soch samaj kar matdaan nahin karata
 If you say something to the contrary, you will be scolded so much that you will refute and then say that there is no one smarter than the voter
 lekin, ham yah sawaal is liye uthaa rahe hai ki salbhar se reliyaan ho rahi hai saikadon karod rupee vigyaapan par phunke ja chuke hai, lekin kisi ne abhi tak ghoshnaptr jari nahin kiya he

 Rahul and Pradeep are breaking the notion that India's election is not based on ideas, policies and vision
 is lekh main bataaya gaya he ki saamaajik suraksha ke niyamon kaa virodh karne vaale zyaadaatar log oonchi jati main hote hai

 Many people view social security schemes with subsidies, appeasement and misuse of tax payers' money

 In the last two years elections have been held in 22 states where the vote percentage has increased significantly

 Former Chief Election Commissioner SY Qureshi has written in the Indian Express that four years ago only ten-twelve percent of the 18–19 year old voters were registered
 ab yah pratishat kaaphi bad gaya he
 The percentage of women among those voting has increased significantly
 iske liye chunaav ayog ne voter jaagrukta ke lagaataar kaarykram chalaae hai
 Even the Election Commission has now started sending voter slips to the voter's house
 jab bhi aapako lage ki india main kuch hua nahin to kam se kam aap in do maheenon ke liye chunaav ayog par garv kar sakate hai
 Will feel good
 to aaj isi par gapastak karenge ki nayaa matadaata apana faisla kaise karne vaala he
 Defeat will not talk of victory, but will understand that the decision process of this powerful voter goes through Google or through TV or heard things or who will win by type survey

 ajtak ke sting 'oparation hurriyat' se jammu kashmir ke algaavvaadiyon kii baukhalahat ab saaf dikhne lagi he
 Aaj Tak Malik, the chief of the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front, rebuffed the Aaj Tak reporter who came to take a reaction to the news highlighting the reality of the Hurriyat
 ajtak samvaadadaata kamaljit sandhu ne jab malik ne kashmir main patharav or virodh pradarshnon ke liye pakistan se funding milane ko lekar jab sawaal poocha, to vah bhadak gaye or sandhu kaa mobile phone chin liya or phir jameen par patakekar tod daalaa
 During this time, Malik also rebuked Aaj Tak's video journalist, Vinod
 kamaljit ke mutabik, jab vah srinagar main laal chok se kuch hi duuri par sthit mysoona main algaavvaadi yaccin malik ke ghar pahunchin, to unhen upar maale par bulaayaa gaya
 Here, in the Aaj Tak sting, when he confessed to taking money from the ISI for the stone-pelting, he sought a response on the camera-seized separatist Naeem Khan, he was furious and put on a scuffle
 kamaljit bataati hai, ' ham jab vahaan pahunche to hamaara camera of tha, hamen bas unki pratikriya chahie thi
 But as soon as Yasin Malik listened to Aaj Tak's sting, he was shocked and said that you too have come from the (intelligence) agency to sting me
 haalanki hamane unhone saaf bataaya ki ham ajtak se hai or bas aapaki pratikriya lenaa chaahate hai
 But he does not agree and stops to snatch the phone, we also told him again that if you do not want to talk then do not, why are you misbehaving in this way
 haalanki yaccin malik phir bhi nahin maane or meraa bag chhina kar sara saamaan phenk kiya
 Then broke the mobile phone
 isse unke haath bhi halakaa cat gaya
 After this, he started shooting down on the back of video journalist Vinod
 is dauraan vinod kii peeth par malik ke khun ke dhabbe bhi pad gaye
 Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti condemned Yasin Malik's attack on Aaj Tak's team and praised Aaj Tak for bringing out the true face of the Hurriyat Conference
 ajtak kii team se baatcheet main mufti ne kaha, 'aapane in netaaon kii asli cheharaa ujagar karne aitihaasik kaam kiya he
 i congratulate you and the India Today team

 At the same time, bjp's Rajya Sabha member Subrahmanyam Swamy has described the attack on Aaj Tak's team as shameful
 unhone kaha, 'yaccin malik kaa cheharaa benakaab ho chukaa he
 He should be arrested under sections 307 and 302 of IPC
 'bataa den ki india today kii vishesh jaanch team (SIT) ne apni tahakikat mempatharabaajon ke dhoort financersko benakaab kiya tha
 It has always been believed that the strands of disturbances spread during the summer in the Kashmir Valley are connected to sponsors sitting across the border
 lekin pehali baar india today ko is sambandh main pukhta saboot jutaney main kamyaabi mili he
 These evidences show how Pakistan writes the script of anger shown in the valley
 saath hi ghati ke asli khalnaayakon kaa kaale chitthey kaa bhi khulaasa hota he
 Provincial president of Hurriyat's Geelani faction Naeem Khan was approached by under-cover reporters of the India Today Special Investigation Team and expressed his willingness to fund the separatists in Kashmir, describing himself as an imaginary Dhankuber
 naeem phir chori chupe dhang se under cover reporters se milane dilli tak pahunch gaya
 The revelations that Naeem made were shocking
 naeem khan camere par ye kehete hue kaid hua ki 'pakistan pichley 6 saal se kashmir main bada pradarshan khadaa karne ke liye haath-pair maar rahaa he
 On what level of money is being pushed to promote violence in the valley, Naeem Khan said, 'the money coming from Pakistan is more than hundreds of crores, but we expect more

 The System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) India has forecast air pollution to be lower this year on Diwali than last year
 SAFAR ke mutabik rashtriya rajdhani dilli main aasapaas ke ilaakon se pradooshit hawaaen utani maatra main nahin aa rahi hai, jitani pichley saal ai thim
 The reason for this is that this time northwest winds are blowing over Delhi on the day of Diwali, whose direction is constantly changing
 haalanki dilli ke aasapaas ke ilaakon ke kheton main pilav lagaataar jalaayaa ja rahaa he, lekin hawa ke rukh se rashtriya rajdhani main raahat rahegi
 Apart from this, the Supreme Court has also banned the sale of firecrackers in delhi-ncr
 lihaaja aatishbaajee nahin hone se bhi vaayu pradooshan kam rahane kii sambhaavna zyada he
 The travel agency working under the Meteorological Department has assessed the potential air pollution on Diwali, envisaging three conditions
 pehali paristhiti main safar ne pariklpana kii ki agar saal 2016 kii tarah hi log aatishbaajee karenge, to saal 2017 kii diwali ke din kya hoga? safar ke mutabik agar aisa hua to bhi hawaaon kii disha rajdhani dilli kii taraf aisi he ki aasapaas ke ilaakon kaa pradooshan yahaan par utana zyada nahin pahonchega, jitna pichley saal pahunchaa tha
 In such a situation, even when people fire the fireworks like last year, this Diwali will reduce pollution due to changed seasonal conditions
 duusari paristhiti main safar ne akalan kiya ki yadi aatishbaajee saal 2016 ke mukaable mahaj aadhi rah jaae, to kya hoga? iske alaava teesri paristhiti main safar ne pariklpana kii ki agar saal 2016 ke mukaable log aatishbaajee karen hi nahin, to kya hoga? in teenon paristhitiyon kaa akalan karne ke baad safar ne yah paaya ki pichley saal ke mukaable is baar diwali main pradooshan kam rahegaa
 According to the forecast of Delhi's Abohavasafar, if people do not make fireworks at all this time as compared to last year, then the air of Delhi will remain in very poor category and this situation will remain till October 22
 iske mukaable agar log supreme court kii pabandi ke baavjood jamkar aatishbaajee karen or pichley saal kii tarah hi karen, to bhi diwali ke din hawa kaa str veri pur category main hi rahegaa
 But on the second day of Diwali, this situation will be terrible and will reach the condition of sevior
 20-21 oktober ko yah sthiti rahegi, lekin 22 oktober ko hawa kii dasha badalane par is pradooshan main sudhaar hoga
 The second reason responsible for pollution more than fireworks The bottom line of Safar's assessment is that while fireworks deteriorate the condition of air, Delhi's climate is dangerous and other major reasons behind fireworks are more responsible
 vaayu pradooshan ke in kaarnon main sabase badi vajah rajdhani dilli main chal rahe lakhon vaahan he or iske saath dilli ke aasapaas ke ilaakon main diwali se pehle kheton main puwaal jalaane se dilli-ensiaar kii hawa jahrili ho jaati he
 Until these reasons are eliminated, it is meaningless to expect clear air around Diwali in the capital Delhi
 pataakhe jalaane par 10 din tak na chalaaen apni gadicenter for science and envyranment kii diarector general sunita narayan kaa kahana he ki haal hi ke dinon main pradooshan rokane ke liye kai kadam uthaae gaye
 This includes steps taken by the state governments besides the Supreme Court ban on crackers
 sunita kaa kahana he ki pataakhon par bain or rajyon main bhi lagu hona chahie
 It should also be arranged that in Diwali, the firecrackers will have to leave their car for 10 days to reduce the pollution caused by fireworks
 pradooshan rokane ke liye uthaae gaye kadamsunita kaa kahana he kidilli main pradooshanko kam karne ke liye jo pahal hui he, usamen sabane sahyog diya
 While on one hand the pollution has been reduced due to the implementation of BS-4, on the other hand the court has asked to make a plan to take steps on increasing pollution
 isamen ensiaar ke sabhi rajya shaamil hai
 Therefore, all governments are considering taking steps to stop pollution together
 iske liye forum ban gaya he
 The third Supreme Court ban on the sale of firecrackers has been greatly affected, but much remains to be done
 australia ke purv captain riki ponting ne ek baar phir varsh 2008 ke 'mankigate' vivaad kii yaaden taaja karte hue usamen bhartiya diggaj ballebaaj sachin tendulkar kii bhoomika par yah kehete hue sawaal uthaaya he ki harbhajan singh ko bachaane vaale sachin tendulkar ke bayaan se vah stabdh rah gaye the
 In his memoir 'the Close of Play', Ricky Ponting said that he could not understand why Sachin Tendulkar supported Harbhajan Singh during the appeal hearing at the time, while all-rounder Andrew Symonds alleged by match referee Mike Proctor Harbhajan Singh himself remained silent when initially suspended for making racist remarks
 riki ponting ne kaha, ''meri samaj main nahin aata ki sachin tendulkar ne match referi mike procter ko yah baat pehle kyon nahin bataai
 
 
 '' darasal, varsh 2008 ke sidney test ke dauraan harbhajan singh par aarope laga tha ki usne kangaroo harfanmaulaa khilaadi andrew symonds ko 'manki' (bandar) kaha tha, jiske kaaran is bhartiya of spinner ko teen test maichon ke liye nilambit kar diya gaya tha
 His suspension was later lifted during a hearing on his appeal
 newjiland ke nyaayamurti jaan henson dwaara kii gai sunwaayee main sachin tendulkar gavaah ke taur par pesh hue the, or unhone harbhajan singh ke paksh main gavaahi di thi
 It is noteworthy that not only has Ponting raised the finger on Sachin Tendulkar's role in the controversy, but former wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist had said the same thing in his autobiography five years ago
 riki ponting ne us ghatana ke bare main kaha ki unhen bada ajeeb laga, jab us ghatana ke baad harbhajan singh par sirf jurmaana lagaaya gaya, jabaki us ghatana se donon deshon ke aapasi sambandh kharaab hone kaa khatra paidaa ho gaya tha
 In the excerpt from the book printed in the Daily Telegraph, Ricky Ponting was quoted as saying, "the judge was not told about any previous offense of Harbhajan Singh, citing an administrative mistake that did not give him the punishment he should get
" was
 
 
 '' Ponting further wrote, "perhaps in the 21st century, Indian cricket was so dominated that it could not be shaken, but then i wondered how many people in the game questioned our motives
" 
 
 kaise unhone sochaa ki ham usulon par kaam karne kii bajaae shrunkhlaa main phayda lenaa chaahate hai
 
 
 '' unhone kaha ki tatkaaleen bhartiya captain anil kumble ke is bayaan ne australian team kii chhavi kharaab kar di ki australia ne khelbhaavna se nahin khelaa
 He said, "I think there was a lot of fanfare in the Monkeygate case
" 
 
 mike procter ne sabhi sabooton ko parakhane ke baad harbhajan singh ko doshi paaya tha
 
 
 The next day the Indians threatened to leave the tour and return
 
 
 '' He said, "anil Kumble's statement received a lot of attention that Australia played the opposite of sportsmanship
" 
 
 baad main yah dharna teji se ban gai ki procter ke nirnay se nahin, balki hamaari vajah se vivaad paidaa hua

 The Supreme Court gave the verdict in favor of Ram Mandir
 Visharad was allowed to worship Ramlala

 Although Gopal Singh Visharad died in 1986
 is tarah se unke nidhan ke 33 saal baad puja kii anumati mili he
 The Supreme Court has asked the Muslim side to be given a separate place in Ayodhya itself
 sunni vaff board ko court ne ayodhya main hi alag jagah jameen dene kaa aadesh diya he
 The Nirmohi Akhara claim has been rejected
 saath hi court ne shiya vakf board ke daawey ko bhi khaarij kar diya he
 Read, SC verdict, Ram temple to be built at disputed site in Ayodhya, separate land for Muslim side
 
 Explain that the Supreme Court has given permission to Gopal Singh Visharad of Hindu Mahasabha to worship Ramlala in Ayodhya
 gopal singh vishaarad vahi shaks hai, jinhone 1949 main babari masjid main murtiyon rakhe jane ke baad hindu mahasabha kii ore se ramalala darshan or pujan ke vyaktigat adhikaar ke liye 1950 main faijabad nyaayalay main mukadmaa daayar kiya tha
 Gopal Singh Visharad filed a lawsuit against the government, Zahoor Ahmed and other Muslims in a civil judge's court on 16 January 1950, asking that Lord Ram and other idols installed on the birthplace should not be removed and that they should not be allowed to visit for worship and worship Do not be stopped

 Senior advocate Harish Salve appeared in the Supreme Court on behalf of Gopal Singh Visharad and later Ranjit Singh debated
 ranjit kumaar ne court main kaha tha ki unka muvakkil ramalala kaa upaask he or vah maanata he ki janmasthan ke maalik bhagwaan ramalala hi hai
 He is a worshiper and has a legal right of worship that must continue
 ayodhya vivaad par shuruaati chaar civil mukademon main se ek gopal singh vishaarad ne daayar kiya tha
 Gopal Singh Visharad was a resident of Swargadwar Mohalla in Ayodhya
 unhen ayodhya kaa pehla karsevak ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 He was associated with the Hindu Mahasabha from the beginning
 rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (aresas) ne desh main sanskrit ko aam bolchaal kii bhashaa banane kii disha main jor dena shuru kiya he
 From the slum-slums to the country's largest Panchayat Parliament House, a ten-day camp is also being set up
 yah plan aresas ke anushangik sanghathan sanskrit bharti ne taiyaar kiya he
 The Sangh is also excited to organize a Sanskrit teaching camp in Parliament House, because this time the number of mps taking oath in Sanskrit has increased in Parliament, while the number of mps taking oath in English has decreased
 sangh kii koshish he ki agali loksabhaa main angreji se zyada sanskrit main shapath lene vaale saansad rahen
 So that there is a big message about Sanskrit in the country, challenging the dominance of English
 sansad bhawan main sambhaashan shivi lagane ke silsile main sanskrit bharti ke akhil bhartiya sanghathan mantri dinesh kaamat kii pichley dinon loksabhaa spikar om birla se mulaakaat ho chuki he
 This proposal of Sanskrit Bharati has been accepted to Om Birla
 unhone jald das dinon ke liye shivi yojit karne kaa aashwaasan diya he
 In fact, the spread of Sanskrit in the country has increased in recent years due to the efforts of the RSS
 saansad sanskrit main shapath lene main ruchi or garv mahasoos karne lage hai
 While 34 mps took oath in Sanskrit in 2014, 47 mps took oath in 2019
 jabaki 2014 main 114 ke mukaable is baar sirf 54 saansad hi angreji main shapath liye
 In the 17th Lok Sabha, the highest number of 210 mps took oath in Hindi
 is prakaar dekhen to ab angreji or sanskrit main shapath lene vaale saansadon ke bich keval saat kaa aankada rah gaya he
 The inspiration of the RSS is being told behind this
 kendriya swasthya mantri dow
 Harshvardhan, Pratap Chand Sarangi, Garhwal MP and BJP National Secretary Tirath Singh Rawat, Meenakshi Lekhi, West Bengal BJP President and Midinapur MP Dilip Ghosh etc
 took oath in Sanskrit this time
 aise sabhi saansadon ko somvaar ko dilli ke constitution club main sanskrit bharti kii ore se sammanit bhi kiya gaya
 But Sanskrit Bharati is trying to instill love for Sanskrit among all the mps of the country's largest panchayat
 kya seekhenge saansdasanskrit bharti ke dilli praant mantri kaushal kishor tiwari ne aajtak
 told that this camp of 20 hours in Parliament House will run for ten days
 har din do ghante saansadon ko sanskrit likhane, padhane or bolne kaa prashikshan diya jayega
 The teachers will give training related to Sanskrit Bharati
 unhone bataaya ki kai saansadon ne khud sanghathan se is shivi ko lagane kii ichha jataai, jiske baad yah faisla liya gaya he
 Tiwari says that language is not spread only by writing and reading, but by speaking
 is shivi ke jariye saansadon ko sanskrit bolne ke liye prerit kiya jayega
 If mps are seen speaking Sanskrit then the common people will also be inspired
 tiwari kaa kahana he ki jahaan bhi sanskrit kaa hit judaa he, vahaan sanskrit bharti khadi he
 Ambedkar was also in love with Sanskrit, All India Organization Minister of Bharati Bharti Dinesh Kamat says that today three crore students in the country are studying Sanskrit, yet efforts are on to revive the language
 kyonki log ise bolte nahin
 There are more than 45 lakh manuscripts in Sanskrit
 unhone kaha ki bharat sirf sansadhano se hi vishwaguru nahin banegaa, use sanskrit bhi apnaani hogi
 It will have to be awakened in every person
 dow
 Ambedkar also advocated declaring Sanskrit as the national language
 kuch logon ne tab unase sawaal poocha tha ki aap to dalit hai, phir kaise brahmanon kii bhashaa kii vakaalat kar rahe hai
 On this, he said that Sanskrit is the language of the people
 ambedkar ne khud se sawaal karne waalon se poocha tha- valmiki kis varg ke the, unhone bhi to sanskrit main ramayana kii rachana kii thi? dinesh kaamat ne kaha ki sanskrit hi aisi bhashaa he jo puure desh ko ek sutara main baandh sakati he
 Those who have been opposing Sanskrit in the past, whether they have been Karunanidhi or Jayalalitha, their names also remain in Sanskrit

 desh main agle saal hone vaale loksabhaa chunaav siddhanton or muddon par lade jaaenge, saath hi chunaav main jeet hasil karne ke baad sahyogi sanghathanon ke saath milakar pradhanmantri par faisla karenge
 He said that Congress President Rahul Gandhi has aggressively raised the BJP in the dock
 2019 main modi sarkaar phir se satta main nahin laut paaegi
 In Aaj Tak's special program Sidhi Baat, Sachin Pilot, who held the post of Deputy Chief Minister after the Congress returned to power in Rajasthan, said that despite being a state of the state of Madhya Pradesh, not being the Chief Minister, more people than educated youth Will come in politics, that is auspicious sign for politics
 har pradesh kii raajnneeti alag he
 The decision taken in Madhya Pradesh is based on the politics there
 rajasthan main liya gaya faisla har kisi ke or pradesh ke hit main he
 Together, we have decided to give a better government to the state in the coming times
 'CM ke saath koi manmutav nahin'upmukhyamantri banaae jane par chehre par dukh kaa koi bhav nahin dikhne par payalat ne kaha, 'kis baat kaa dukh
 i am thankful that the party considered me worthy of this
 party ne is bade pradesh kii ahm jimmedaari di he to meri koshish he ki uskaa sahi tareeke se nirvahan kiya jaae
 We will try to give good government
 ' rajya mantrimandal ke liye dilli par nirbharta ke bare main unhone kaha ki yah pehle se hi hota rahaa he or antim faisla congress adhyaksh hi karata he
 There is no estrangement with the Chief Minister of the state
 rajya main jeet ke liye har kisi ko shrey jaataa he
 At the time of 4 months before the next general election, Sachin Pilot said that the intention of the government is shown in the beginning
 ham bade-bade mehalon main rahakar janata se dur rahakar kaam karenge to janata use sweekaar nahin karegi, lekin hamaari niyat, kaam karne kaa tarika or hamaara bartaav or sarkaar kii policy yah sab kuch nirbhar karti he ki ise kis tarah se kiya jaataa he
 Babu who works will remain the same, but depending on how they can be used
 madhya pradesh main adhikariyon ke tabadale par unhone kaha ki prashasnic str par badlaav to jaruri he, lekin kaam karne kaa tarika ahm he ki unase kaise kaam liya ja saktaa he
 On the party's successive victories in the state, he said that we worked in unison and that is why we won continuously
 jeet ke baad tay hoga netarahul gandhi ke agle chunaav kii taiyaariyon or bataur pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar ke sawaal par sachin payalat ne kaha ki kabhi bhi rahul gandhi ne nahin kaha ki unhen pradhanmantri ke rup main project kariye
 The DMK has talked of declaring Rahul as the prime ministerial contender
 lekin congress or sahyogi sanghathanon ne aapas main tay kar rakhaa he ki chunaav main jeet hasil karne ke baad mil-baithkar pradhanmantri tay karenge
 Only after the victory will it be decided who will be the leader of the alliance
 unhone kaha ki pichley kareeb 30 saalon se gandhi parivaar se koi bhipradhanmantrinhin bana, mukhyamantri nahin bana
 Everyone works for the party and our struggle today is not to gain power
 vyavastha ko parivartit karne ke liye he kyonki bijepi ne aaj desh main jo maahaul banaaya he wo achche sanket nahin hai
 We are fighting on election issues and principles
 sabko saath lekar lard rahe hai
 If the constitution and the constitutional organizations of the country are harmed, it will not be in the national interest
 sanghathanon kaa vishwaas nahin to janata kaa vishwaas kaiseschin payalatne kaha ki congress or bijepi main yah badi baat he ki ham sabko saath lekar chalate hai
 NDA is constantly falling apart, just recently Upendra Kushwaha has given up
 shivasena or tidipi ne bhi saath chhod diya he
 Shiv Sena has left together to see you
 jo log apane sahyogi sanghathanon kaa vishwaas nahin paa sakate, wo desh kii janata kaa vishwaas kaise hasil kar sakate hai
 Their time has come
 agle saal chunaav main upie kaa jeetna tay he or in 3 rajyon ke chunavi parinaam ne sab kuch spasht kar diya he
 On the leadership of Rahul Gandhi after the election results of 3 states, the pilot said that it seems certain, Rahul Gandhi started our election campaign in all three states
 unhone aakraamak hokar bijepi ko katghare main khadaa kiya he
 Under his leadership, we contested and won three states
 unke virodhiyon or aalochakon ko maananaa padegaa ki rahul gandhi ne sabit kar diya ki tamaam paisa or takat hone ke baavjood unhone yahaan par jeet hasil kii
 On Rahul Gandhi becoming a Hindutva leader, he said that Rahul has always kept focus on corruption, inflation, farmers' issues etc
 bijepi jati-dharm kii raajnneeti kii he
 The Congress never talked about religion
 congress hi ekmaatr dal he jo sabhi ko ek saath lekar chalati he
 He said that all opposition organizations will have to unite to defeat the NDA
 unki neeli ankhon main ab bhi kamyaabi kaa vah sapana he, jo har kalakaar kii ankhon main hota he
 But the difference is that Neil Nitin Mukesh still costs Rs
 3 crores
 laga rahe hai or filmi bazaar ise chutkula samajhkar hans rahaa he
 When Neil asked for a price of three crores after hearing the story from a producer who was in a rush to sign Neil for his new film, he asked for some time
 teen dinon main vah film bazaar ke kharidaaron ke bich thi or nil kii keemat koi 50 lakh se zyada dene ko taiyaar nahin tha
 One buyer openly said that even this amount is till the release of Abbas Mastan's film (which also has Abhishek Bachchan with him)
 agar is film ne kuch kamaal nahin kiya to nil ko 50 main se bhi ek shunya kam hone kaa dukh sahanaa padegaa
 He has left producer Neil and Neil is now contacting him so that there can be some price negotiation
 samajhdaar nirmaataa ne to kar lee jai ram ji or bechaare nil ko apane haathon se 50 lakh ru
 They are also seen slipping
 ek saptahik main kuchhek saal pehle aakanksha paare kashiv kii ek kahani padhi thi—teen saheliyah teen premi
 The short story was that three friends meet in a restaurant on a winter afternoon and chat about their love affairs in a very comfortable way and leave each other after a while
 dekhne main bahut hi saadhaaran-si lagane vaali mulaakaat or kisi bhi tarah kii atirikt naatakeeyata se rahit
 Despite this, the story keeps us tied till the end that something will happen now
 koi aashcharya nahin, usee saal is kahani ko ramakant smriti sammaan se nawaja gaya tha
 This first story of Aakanksha itself had given the assurance that in his other stories, the possibilities would also give an opportunity to be interacted with
 ab unka 14 kahaniyon kaa ek sangrah aayaa he bahattar dhadakanen tihattar armaan
 In this too, except for two-three stories, no one seems to have imposed any external theatricality in the characters or situations
 is drushti se phulon vaali ladki, dear papa, campus lav, madhyantar or pyaar-vyaar jaisi kahaniyon ko rekhaankit kiya ja saktaa he
 a situation begins, the characters meet and until the end nothing happens that can be called dramatic in the ordinary sense
 ekadam se amarkant kii kahani dopaher kaa bhojan kii yaad dilaa detii hai ye kahaniyaan
 The question can be raised that if there is no dramaticness in the story itself then what is it that keeps our eagerness till the end? In my view, this is attributed to the structure and craft of the stories from which they weave their stories
 unhone har baar ek nai style ko apanaaya he
 Seventy-two beats in the seventy-three Armaan moving the story through their own thinking of Abhay Shukla and Naureen, exchanging love letters in typical Khanty style in Dil Rani Sapna Ka Sahajada or a government in easy tales of difficult love There should be a flourishing love relationship between the staff teaching in the college — the craft of every story is the defining element on which well-known, everyday stories and stories Begins to gain a new kind of theatricality
 aisa nahin ki aakanksha ke yahaan prem kahaniyon kii bharmaar he, jab bhi avasar mila he, unhone saamaajik, rajnatik halaat kaa bhi gaharaai se jayja liya he
 Take the shop owner, how people change their mind about a character like a well-known aunt after the communal riots
 khud sheershak kahani, jisamen hindu ladke or muslim ladki ke bich pehle pyaar, phir vivaah or antat algaav
 Both become big and deep stories because nowhere in them is there even the slightest amount of emotional sentiment on problems, but all situations have been looked at through spontaneous normal reactions
 yahaan un do kahaniyon ko bhi nahin choda ja saktaa jo hamaare chaaron taraf failte soshal media ke indrajaal kii dein hai
 Control Adelete or Nigehbani — both stories expose chest horrors in our lives under the pressure of the Internet, Twitter, Instagram, and industrial mechanics
 sari kahaniyaan aakanksha se bhavishya main or behatar kii ummid paidaa karti hai
 Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas president and former BJP MP Ram Vilas Vedanti told in a special conversation with 'aaj Tak' that the construction work of Sri Ram temple in Ayodhya will start soon and it will be before the 2019 elections
 ram vilaas vedanti ne bataaya ki narendra modi ke pradhanmantri banane ke pehle atakalein lagaai jaati thim ki shriram mandir banegaa yaa nahin lekin modi ke pradhanmantri banane ke baad ye atakalein khatm huin or logon ko bharosa ho gaya he ki mandir kaa nirmaan pradhanmantri ke netritv main hokar rahegaa
 Ram Vilas Vedanti said that no party other than BJP wants Ramji's temple to be built in Ayodhya
 unhone kaha ki upi ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath gujarat main sardaar vallabhbhai patel kii vishaal murti dekhne ke baad prabhavit hue or faisla kiya ki duniya kii sabase badi pratimaa shriram kii banegi or vah bhi ayodhya main sarayu ke tat par
 Significantly, the Yogi government is going to build a copper statue of 151 meters high Ram in Ayodhya
 is pratimaa ko 36 meter ke chabutare par rakhaa jayega
 Let us tell you that last year, the Yogi government announced a plan to install a 100-meter-high statue of Lord Rama
 tab 'navy ayodhya' yojana ke tahat dharmik paryaton ko badhaava dene ke liye yogi sarkaar ne rajyapal ram nik ko prapojal bhi dikhaaya tha
 The plan was made in May 2018 by the tourism department regarding the statue of Lord Rama
 'nayaa ayodhya' yojana ke tahat sarayu nadi ke kinare pratimaa ko sthapit kiya jayega
 It is estimated to cost up to Rs 330 crore
 iske saath hi sarkaar ramakatha gailaree, paryatakon ke thaharne ke sthal, suraksha kii drushti se sisitivi camera, police booth, avaagaman ke saadhan sahit anya naagarik suvidhaayen jaise shauchalay or jal nikasi kii samuchit vyavastha karegi
 Earlier, UP CM Yogi Adityanath had said that he is going to Ayodhya with great good news on Diwali
 nyaay ke devtaa shanidev ko khush karnaa aasaan nahin he
 But if Shanidev becomes happy then understand that you will not have to face problems
 shanidev karmon kaa fal dete hai or kai baar grahon kii dasha kharaab hone se bhi insaan ko uske kathin parishram kaa fal nahin mil paata
 But this does not mean that Shanidev's vision is on you
 apane man se yah dharna nikaal den ki saare dukhon kaa kaaran shani grah hi hai

 dhokhebaajon se bachaayenge bhairav ji, aaj aise karen puja- prayek mangalvaar or shanivaar ko bhairav sadhana or mantra-jap karen
 - Worshiping Maa Bhagwati Kali gives extremely auspicious results
 sanbhal kar karenge daan to nahin hoga nuksaan- ghar main sandhya ke samay gugal kii dhoop den
 - Recite Hanuman Chalisa on Tuesday and Saturday and light a lamp on the Peepal tree

 Mahendra Chawla, former private secretary to Asaram's son Narayan Sai, has revealed many such things which can increase the difficulties of Asaram and his close ones
 panipat ke chote-se gaanv sanauli main rahane vaale narayan swami ke purv nijee sachiv mahendra chawla ne asaram, unke bete narayan sai par kai gambheer aarope lagaae hai
 Mahendra Chawla, who was Narayan Sai's personal secretary from 2001 to 2005, said that there are many black acts in the ashram
 yadi sarkaar va police prashasan unhen suraksha muhaiyaa karwaae, to ve bataa sakate hai ki kis prakaar ashram main mahilaon kaa shoshan hota he or sex racket chalata he
 Mahendra Chawla said that money laundering takes place in the ashram and even there are many murders, but everyone is afraid to disclose due to fear from Asaram's disciples and guards
 unhone bataaya ki ashramon main tantra vidya or kaala jaadu kaa jamkar prayog hota he
 He has provided many such documents to the administration, in which the document written by Narayan Sai has many serious uses of black magic like killing, captivating, harming a man
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki kai baar pehle bhi asaram par balaatkaar ke aarope lagate rahe hai, parantu ve apane prabhaav kaa istemaal kar maamla dabaane main kaamyaab rahete hai
 He said that he is receiving threats to kill him by Asaram supporters

 Mahendra said that Asaram is a financier and values money rather than spirituality
 unhone kaha ki narayan sai mahaj aisho-aaraam ke liye sex va veeryavardhak dawaaon kaa seven regular karte hai

 is task main sho main pehali baar ladakon kii takadir ladakiyon ke haath main thi
 In fact, each of the five boys on the show at the task was given a pond and all the girls received baskets full of fish
 ladkiyaan jis ladke ko ghar se beghar hone ke liye nominete karnaa chaahati thim, unhen us ladke ke talab main apni tokari main rakhi sabhi machhliyaan us ladke ke talab main daalani thim
 Devolina is the queen of the house, so she was given two baskets full of fish, which she had to put in the pond of a single boy
 task ke aakhir main jis ladke ke talab main sabase kam machhliyaan hotin, unhen agle hafte kii nomination se surakshit kiya janaa tha
 Under this, Siddharth Shukla is protected from next week's nomination, as there was not a single fish in his pond at the end of the task and with this, the other four boys have gone into elimination
 rajkot shahar main greenland chaukadi par gadde bane afatlogon ne kii kai baar shikaayat, par nahin hui karrwyaap rajkot aa rahe hai to greenland chaukadi par aapkaa bade-bade gaddhon se swaagat hoga
 However, these pits have become a disaster for the locals
 jarjar sadakon ko lekar logon ne kai baar shikaayat kii par koi karrwai nahin hui
 Distressed by this, the locals here protested in a unique way
 lakshmana bhai har roj yahaan se guzarate hai
 One day he was carrying vegetables from his car to the marketing yard, then his car got damaged by getting stuck in the pit
 is dauraan unhen or unke dost ko gambhir chotein bhi ain
 Angered by this, Lakshman Bhai found a unique way to protest
 lakshamna bhai ne gadde main letkar pradarshan shuru kiya
 During this he asked his friends to pour mud on himself
 unhone kaha ki ab gadde main hi rahanaa he
 If the public pays tax, why do they not get the facilities for their rights? trephic rulls ke liye baari jurmaane kaa praavdhaan he, lekin prashasan ko sadakon par gadde nahin dikhaai de rahe hai
 Actually, due to rain in Rajkot, the metropolitan municipality has been exposed
 rajkot ko smart city bataane vaala rajkot prashasan ab smart city kaa naam tak nahin letaa hai
 The Assembly constituency of the Chief Minister comes in the Rajkot Metropolitan Municipality itself
 dilli sarkaar ke mukhya sachiv anshu prakaash aam aadmi party sarkaar main mantri or AAP vidhayakon ke bich baithkar chaay kii chuskiyaan or biscuit kaa anand lete najar aae

 haalanki, wo kaarykram main tab aae jab mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal vahaan se nikal chuke the
 On this meeting, Minister Rajendra Gautam said that we are all members of the family
 bhai-bhai main bhi jhagada ho jaataa he
 We all should protect our honor
 kaam sabhi ko karnaa padegaa
 The authorities should close the Protest
 vahiin, aap vidhayak madanlaal ne kaha ki chif secetry se matbhed nahin the
 He had also filed a report in one case
 system main har kisi kii ek duty he
 The chief secretary is very good in practice but when work is not done, the bitterness increases
 is dauraan vidhayak anil bajpeyi ne kaha ki chif secetry ne bataaya ki vidhayak bhi mujhase milane aa sakate hai
 Confrontation is not our job
 chif secetry or mukhyamantri dilli ke liye hi kaam kar rahe hai
 This is the first time since the incident on February 20 at the Chief Minister's residence that Chief Secretary Anshu Prakash has been seen sipping tea together with mlas in a public place
 bataa den ki aaj bhi tamaagadhikariyonki kisi vidhayak yaa mantri ke saath hone vaali baithkon main jane par virodh kaa silsilaa jari he
 Meanwhile, this meeting of Anshu Prakash and AAP mlas themselves has cleared a lot
 tasviren gavaah hai ki is mulaakaat main vidhayakon ke saath na sirf achche maahaul main baatcheet hui balki unke saath chaay-biscuit kaa silsilaa bhi chalaa

 Now very few things can be bought with coins
 khaas taur par kam mulya vaale sikkon se
 Everyone knows what the value of the coin is because it remains engraved on it
 lekin kya aapane kabhi is par hairaani jataai he ki sikke ko banane par laagat kitni aati he? kya ye laagat sikke ke mulya se zyaada bhi ho sakati he?sikkon kii laagat se judi is paheli ko sulajhane ke liye india today ne soochna ke adhikaar (RTI) ke tahat bhartiya rigerv bank (RBI) se jaankaree maangi
 We also wanted to know from the RBI that at present, which value coins are being manufactured by the Government of India? How many such coins were minted in the last 5 years
 hamaare sawaalon ko RBI ne desh kii sabhi taksaalon ko bheja
 The Indian Government Mint, Mumbai responded that currently coins of Rs 10, Rs 5, Rs 2 and Rs 1 are being minted in this mint
 jawaab main beete 5 saal main taksaal kii ore se jin alag alag mulya ke sikkon ko dhaala gaya, unki jaankaree bhi di gai
 However, the mint refused to disclose the cost of the coins, citing confidentiality
 taksaal ne jawaab main kaha, “ye jaankaree artiai act, 2005 ke section 8 (1) (d) ke tahat uplabdh nahin karai ja sakati kyonki ye trade sikret he
 The answer to the Hyderabad government mint was also sent by the RBI to India Today questions to another government mint in Hyderabad
 is taksaal kii ore se bhi yahi jawaab diya gaya ki philhal uski ore se chaar mulyon ke sikke hi dhaale ja rahe hai
 And those coins are - Rs 10, Rs 5, Rs 2 and Rs 1
 hyderabad taksaal ne ye bhi bataaya ki beete chaar saal main alag alag mulya ke kitne sikke dhaale gaye
 However, the mint had no qualms in explaining the cost incurred on the manufacture of coins like the Mumbai mint
 hyderabad taksaal ke mutabik 1 rupye ke sikke ko banane main ausat laagat 1 rupye 11 paise aati he
 It is clear that the value of this coin is more than the cost

 As Mahatma Gandhi's death anniversary comes to a close, the atmosphere of the Hindu Mahasabha office in central Delhi is heating up

 The winter session of Parliament has gone into controversies like re-conversion or 'homecoming' and it is feared that the Opposition may ruin the budget session on the pretext of these issues
 isi chintaa ke saath modi ne aresas ke varisht netritv se baat kii he or kaha he ki ve apane ugr aanushanbik sanghathanon ko kuch kaabo main rakhen
 a BJP leader close to Modi recently said in Ahmedabad, "such an open campaign of re-conversion can completely backfire because it will not only give a new impetus to the work of Christian missionaries, but also Modi's good governance agenda and his international This will also have a significant impact on the image
 hamaare agenda ko chupchaap or bina surkhiyon main laae hue aage badhanaa hoga
 "it seems that RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat has understood this, at least for now

 In his speech, he mentioned his campaigner-turned-prime minister's landslide victory in the Lok Sabha elections and said, "we should take advantage of favorable conditions
" " is maukey par bijepi adhyaksh amit shah maujuud the
 In the case of the alleged overthrow of the RSS on the issue of re-conversion, a close leader of Modi indicated that serious differences had started to emerge between Modi and the RSS leadership as RSS officials like Rajeshwar, with their antics, announced Modi's national agenda of economic development Started distributing attention
 aresas tak modi kaa yah sandesh amit shah or aresas ke sah sarkarywah tathaa bijepi se uske samanvayak krishna gopal ne pahunchaaya
 Krishna Gopal was previously known to dislike Modi's autocratic style of work but has now laid down his arms
 modi ke kareebi netaa ke mutabik, krishna gopal hi rajeshwar singh ko lambii chuttee par bhejne main madadgaar sabit hue
 But another RSS leader, on the condition of anonymity, says that apart from Modi's displeasure, Rajeshwar has also fallen from the eyes of the RSS leadership
 vajah yah he ki 2021 tak 'hindu raashtra' nirmaan kii unki ghoshnaa shaayad khud bhagwat kii baton ko chunauti de rahi thi
 The RSS chief had recently said in Kolkata and Ahmedabad that 'hindu Rashtra' is the eternal truth, all the creeds and religions of India are its units i

 So in December, when Hindu Mahasabha announced the installation of Godse's idol in its offices in Delhi, Meerut and Ambala (where he was hanged), Rakesh Sinha, director of the RSS think tank India Policy Foundation in Delhi, tweeted, ' 'no murderer should be glorified, be it Lincoln or Gandhi
 godse kaa aresas se koi sambandh nahin tha
 "in an interview, Sinha spoke candidly about Godse's glorification efforts
 unhone kaha, ''godse kaa koi mandir nahin hona chahie
 We cannot glorify it and shed a reverse stream, even if it has never been a nationalist
 tathy yah he ki usne mahatma kii hatya kii isliye hamane uske pehle ke yogadan ko bhula diya
 The RSS views the Mahatma with great respect despite some objections
 "is par hindu mahasabha ke mahasachiv madan acharya ne palat waar kiya, ''sabase pehle aresas kii 'ghar vaapasi' karai jaani chahie kyonki vah kabhi hindu mahasabha se hi niklaa he
 "meerut police have filed a lawsuit against Madan Acharya for insulting Mahatma Gandhi
 isamen shaq nahin ki godse hindu mahasabha or aresas ke bich kaa aadmi tha
 The RSS may refute as much as it has been a member of both organizations
 mahatma kii hatya ke samay sardaar vallabhbhai patel ne hi aresas sarasanghachaalak em
 s
 golwalkar ko chitthee main likhaa tha ki mahatma kii hatya kii khabar sunakar aresas ke logon ne mithaiyaan banti thim
 The Godse statue is to be installed on January 30 on a cement platform under a banyan tree in Meerut
 vahiin baithe hindu mahasabha ke sadsy ashok sharma kehete hai, ''modi yah chunaav apane arthik vikaas ke vaade par nahin, balki hindutv ke agenda par jite hai
 They should understand this
 unhen hindutv ke agenda ko aage badhaane main hamaari madad kerani chahie
 "similarly, Ram Gopal, the state head of the Dharm Jagran Manch in Punjab, said in 2005 the then RSS chief's campaign to bring back Sikhs living in areas bordering Pakistan, back to Hinduism

 It was Sudarshan who started it
 gopal or unke 'swayamsevakon' kii fouj ne sabase pehle fazilka ke gurudware se 'ghar vaapasi' abhiyaan kii shuruyaat kii
 Now he has succeeded in converting 2,000 people every year in Gurdaspur, Amritsar, Batala, Taran Taran, Ferozepur and Abohar
 haalanki dharmantaran ke mudde par yah to kaha hi ja saktaa he ki modi or aresas ke bich, asthaayee hi sahi, samajhaita ho gaya
 Both sides have agreed to keep him away from the headlines
 jahaan tak hindu mahasabha ke godse ke mahimamandan kaa sawaal he, aresas or modi, donon hi jaanate hai ki ve hindutv ke agenda kaa laabh duusare sanghathan ko uthaane kii ijaajat nahin de sakate
 Sinha resented when asked that if the Hindu Mahasabha erects a statue of Godse, will the RSS take any action against him? RSS spokesperson Manmohan Vaidya dismisses it as a "meaningless issue"
 naam na chhapane kii shart par aresas ke ek netaa ne sweekaara ki modi dilli main usee tarah bagdor apane haath main rakhe hue hai, jaise gujarat main rakhaa karte the
 The RSS leadership fully realizes this
 in netaa ke mutabik modi jab gujarat ke mukhyamantri the to aresas se matbhed mitaane ke liye centre main adhik mahatv ke vaade par samajhaita ho jaataa tha, chaahe vishwa hindu parishad ke praveen togdipha ko darkinar karne kaa maamla ho yaa chunaavon main aresas ke praant prachaarak kii salaah na maanane kaa maamla ho yaa bijli kii daren badhaane ke khilaaf aresas ke aanushanbik sanghathan bhartiya kisaan sangh kii maang kii upeksha ho
 a few months ago, RSS general secretary Bhaiyyaji Joshi went to see the three bigha hatras on the Bangladesh border when the Seema Surhana Bal (BSF) explained to him in detail about the "existing Surhana system"
 aresas yah dekhakar bhi khush he ki uske kai netaaon ko satta or mahatv kaa pad mila he or modi rajyapalon kii niyukti se lekar kai masalon par aresas se salaah karte hai
 An RSS leader said, "this is our government
" aakhirkaar modiji kai saal tak prachaarak rahe hai
 We know each other very well
 gathbandhan sarkaar chalaane vaale atalji ke vipareet modiji ko baari bahumat mila he or ham sabhi kamobesh saath-saath hai
 "leaders close to Modi believe that both the Prime Minister and the RSS need each other and most of the differences are about strategies, not basic ones
 ve bataate hai ki modi ne shuruyaat main hi isaki bhoomika rakh di thi
 In a meeting of newly-elected BJP mps in the Central Hall of Parliament House after winning the election last May, Modi said that after "1,200 years of slavery", a pro-hindutva party came to power
 modi sarkaar chah maheene kii satta main jaise-taise apni shuruaati samasyaon se paar paa chuki he or lagata he ki vah ab shiksha, samskruti, arthvyavastha or rashtriya suraksha jaise vyapak masalon par aresas se gahan vichaar-vimarsh ko taiyaar ho chuki he
 But she also knows that if she is to leave her mark, she needs to succeed in all these matters, especially in the economy
 yah bhi tay he ki naakaami use aresas kii marji par or ashrith kar degi
 The honeymoon phase of the Modi government has passed with the new year

 " Manish Sisodia, Education Minister at Mail Today's Annual Education and Skill Summit, Delhi, said that there is a need for a big change in the school exam system of the country
 sisodiya ne daawa kiya ki maujuuda chunautiyon main skulon main lagu exam paddati chaatro kaa uchit akalan karne main sakasham nahin he
 Manish said that education has already been a standard in Delhi
 bihar or upi jaise rajyon kii tulana main dilli kii schooling hameshaa se behatar rahi he
 On higher education, however, Sisodia said that the British had made a law for Delhi that just one university is needed in Delhi
 lekin hamaari sarkaar ne is kanoon ko darkinar kar naekolegebanane kii kavayad kii
 Apart from this, there is such a challenge in front of schools and colleges in Delhi which is not seen in states like up-biha
 sisodiya ne bataaya ki dilli main skool kholane ke liye unhen jameen nahin milti
 For many years, he has had to wait for the Central Government to get permission for a school and in the end, he has to buy land for the school
 sisodiya ne kaha ki jameen kii aisi chunauti upi-bihar jaise rajyon main nahin he
 Referring to two important challenges in the way of strengthening school education after the formation of the Aam Aadmi Party government in Delhi, Manish said that we need to take education as education
 manish ne daawa kiya ki unki sarkaar ne shiksha kii chunautiyon ko nae sire se samajha
 Sisodia said that after the formation of his government, he saw that cleanliness was a big problem in Delhi's schools, while there was enrollment of 140 to 170 children in a classroom
 aisi sthiti main yahaan skulon main padhai kaa koi maahaul nahin tha
 Teachers, including the principal at the school, lost their time in fixing the infra
 sisodiya ne kaha ki is chunauti ko dur karne ke liye aam aadmi party ne dilli ke skulon main estate manager niyukt karne kaa praavdhaan kiya jisase principal samet sabhi teachers sirf bacchon kii padhai par apana dhyaan kendrit kar saken
 On the school's examination system, Sisodia said, "our examination system is not good
" bina padhaaye ham paas karte ja rahe hai
 Either exam will be so difficult that children have no choice but to rote
 padhaate vakt teacher kaa mindblock he ki bacchon ko pichley paanch saal main aae sawaalon ke jawaab taiyaar kara den
 At the same time, the tendency of those who set the paper, instead of assessing the knowledge of children, is focused on their ability to cram
 ’iske alaavasisodiyane kaha ki unki koshish koshish teacher quality ko sahi karne kii rahi
 His government has also got a big help in this work too
 iske baad tisare number par aam aadmi party kii sarkaar ne content par kaam shuru kiya he

 sahaara samooh ke pramukh subrat royore samooh ke teen anya bade adhikari buudhvaar ko bazaar niamak sebi ke saamne hajir hue
 SEBI had issued orders to appear in the matter of refunding them a total amount of Rs 24,000 crore from more than three crore investors
 sahaara vivaad: kai raaston kaa saharajaibi ke samaksh pesh hone ke baad subrat roy ne kaha ki unase nijee sampattiyon ke bare main poocha gaya
 He said, 'we have asked SEBI to start giving money that is deposited
 hamen teen karod niveshkon kii chintaa he
 'sahara controversy: In trouble, but not without recourse,' Subrata Roy said, 'I told SEBI that you and our team should sit down and make plans to return investors' money
 hamane zyaadaatar niveshkon ke paise laute die hai or baaki paise sebi ke paas pade hai
 Sahara case: SEBI bans the accounts
 Let us tell you that apart from Roy, Sahara group's Ashok Rai Choudhary, Ravi Shankar Dubey and Vandana Bhargava appear personally in front of Prashant Sharan, a full-time member of this regulatory body at SEBI headquarters in Mumbai
 Was called sebi kii SC main arji, sahaara pramukh giraftaar honsebi ne 26 march ko sahaara samooh ke in chaar logon ko saman jari kiye the
 He was summoned as a director of two group companies to verify the details of his personal assets and the investments and assets of the companies concerned, and to arrange for the funds to be repaid back to the investors for their fixed assets
 The auction process can be taken forward
 sahaara samooh ke in adhikariyon ko vyaktigat peshi ke dauraan donon companiyon, sahaara india real estate corp limited (esaiaraisiel) or sahaara houseing investment corp limited (eechaisiel) kii sabhi parisampattiyon or unke nivesh ke malikana haq sambandhi dastavejon kii mul pratiyaan prastut karne ko bhi kaha gaya tha
 These two companies of Sahara Group were directed by the Supreme Court in their order dated 31 August 2012 to return Rs 24,000 crore of bond holders in three months
 isi aadesh main sebi ko niveshkon kaa satyaapan karte hue unka paisa lautaane ko kaha gaya tha
 Later on December 5, 2012, the court gave additional time to the Sahara group to immediately deposit Rs 5,120 crore and then to deposit Rs 10,000 crore in the first week of January and the rest by the first week of February
 ucchtam nyaayalay ke adeshon ke anusaar bhugtan na kiye jane par sebi ne kurki kaa aadesh nikaal diya
 Sahara Group claims that it has already given most of the money to the investors and the rest of its liability is less than the amount of Rs 5,120 crore deposited with SEBI
 nyaayalay ne kaha tha ki yadi sahaara samooh niveshkon kaa dhan lautaane ke liye paisa jamaa nahin karaati hai to sebi unke khate jabt karne or sampatti kurk karne ko swatantra he
 a few days later, SEBI had issued attachment orders
 sebi ke anusaar esaiaraisiel or esechasiiel ne bonddharakon se 6,380 karod rupee or 19,400 karod rupee jutaaye the par dhan jutaney main ‘kai tarah kii aniyamitatayen’ kii gayin
 In the same orders, these firms and their top executives were asked to submit details of assets and accounts etc
 by April 8
 sebi ne pichley maheene kaha ki uske in adeshon kaa anupaalan nahin kiya gaya he
 Therefore, it issued a new order to initiate the process of auctioning the properties so that the money could be raised to return the investors' money
 sanyog se pratibhuti apiliy nyaayaadhikaran (sat) bhi isi saptaah 13 april ko sebi ke aadesh ke khilaaf subrat roy or anya dwaara daayar apilon par sunwaayee karne vaala he
 In these appeals, these individuals have challenged Sebi's earlier order to attach their bank accounts, assets and investments
 in parisampattiyon main sahaara samooh kaa pune ke kareeb viksit ambi vaili resort, dilli, mumbai or desh main kuch anya jagahon kii jameen-jaaydaad, share, mutual fund or anya prakaar ke nivesh shaamil hai
 Roy and three other top executives were also directed to furnish original copies of documents pertaining to ownership of all assets and investment of Sahara India Real Estate Corp Ltd and Sahara Housing Investment Corp during personal appearance

 '' kya bihar main sattarudh janata dal united apane supremeo nitish kumaar ko ab 'kaamchalaoo' or 'asthaayee' maanati he
 People are asking these questions after the new hoardings were installed outside the party office on Monday
 ravivaar shaam , patna main party daphtar ke baahar nae hording lagaae gaye jisamen naaraa tha , ‘kyun kare vichaar thike to he nitish kumaar'
 Surely whoever wrote the slogan would have the hoardings installed with the consent of senior party leaders, especially Nitish Kumar, close to RCP Singh
 lekin party ke hi netaaon ko lagata he ye naaraa logon ko pach nahin rahaa
 The meaning of this is that in Bihar's politics and village house it is not that they are very good, but they are very helpful
 ye hai janata dal united kaa nayaa naaraa 
 Nitishe Kumar is out in Bihar, Prashant Kishore had a brain
 lekin is naye naaraa se unka koi vaasta nahin 
 pic
 twitter
 com / tjspohtrri He says that during the last Vidhan Sabha elections, hoarding posters were put up during the Lok Sabha elections with slogans like 'sachcha Hai Achhe Hai Nitish Ke Chale' during the Lok Sabha elections
 vahiin is baar jo ek shabd 'thike' he kaa prayog kiya gaya he usase to yahi sabit hota he ki nitish kumaar kii party bhi maanati he ki wo sarvshereshth yaa kushal prashaasak ab nahin rahe balki jo raajnneetik maahaul he usamen vah bas thik hi hai 
 Till now the party claimed that there was no better Chief Minister in Bihar than Nitish Kumar, there is no better administrator than him, but what to say when the party believes that he is okay
 haalanki janata dal united ke pravaktaa sanjay singh kaa kahana hai ki ye slogan baarah karod janata kii aakanksha kaa pratik he
 He also admitted that the slogan had nothing to do with Prashant Kishore, the party's national vice president

 The postmortem report of Tamerlan has not yet arrived
 devo ne kaha ki do dinon kii talaashi ke baad sthaneey police ne do alag-alag car chalaa rahe do bhaaiyon ko dekha
 Soon after, the two brothers got off their vehicles and started firing at the police
 devo ne kaha, kam se kam 200 goliyaan chalin, yah shaayad 300 bhi ho sakati hai
 He said, i saw Tamerlan firing at the police
 yah khaufnak tha
 According to Devo, the Sarnaev brothers hurled something at police officers, which was apparently a pressure cooker bomb

 dudi ne apane hi sarkaar par aarope lagaaya ki police ke takat ke bal par rajasthan cricket association kaa chunaav sarkaar taalna chaahati he kyonki use haarane kaa dar he

 uttar pradesh ke bhim army ekta mishan ke sansthaapak chandrashekhar ''ravan" haal hi main 8 november ko apni peshi ke dauraan banaae gaye ek viral video main kehete hai, ''chandrashekhar aaazaad faansee se nahin dare the to main rasuka se kyon darun
 "chandrasekhar and his organization are once again in the limelight in western Uttar Pradesh
 vajah he, hycourt se unhen jamaanat milane ke baad aanan-fanan rajya sarkaar kii ore se un par rashtriya suraksha kanoon (rasuka) lagaana
 It is as if politics is not ready to give up Chandrasekhar
 lagata he, siyaasi takatein ek ore to daliton ko lubhaana chaahati hai, lekin duusari ore unke yuva chehre chandrashekhar ko dabaanaa bhi chaahati hai
 In the same video, Chandrasekhar says, "the government does not want me to get out of jail
" "darasal, chandrashekhar ko may 2017 main saharanpur main hui jaateey hinsa ke aaropon main estf (special task force) ne himachal pradesh ke dalhousie se 8 june, 2017 ko giraftaar kiya tha
 In all cases, the district administration served a notice of action under Rasuka even before release of the court after getting bail from the court
 is karrwai se pehle chandrashekhar jail main apni jaan ko khatra bataa chuke the
 In such a situation, the question arises that how can a person who himself is in danger of his life suddenly become a threat to national security? And if not national security, then who is in danger? Recently, on October 27, Chandrasekhar was suddenly brought from the District Jail to Saharanpur District Hospital for treatment due to a serious stomach infection and was admitted to the ICU
 ilaaj ke baad unhen phir jail main shift hue haftaa bhar hi hua tha ki 7 november ko raat main unhen achaanak gambhir biimaar bataate hue jail se meerut medical college main ilaaj ke liye refer kar diya gaya
 He had 21 cases registered against him and was implicated in five cases during the SIT investigation
 chandrashekhar ke adhivaktaa harpal singh jivan bataate hai, ''ek mukademe main esgm, saharanpur court se jamaanat ho chuki he or baaki chaar main 30 aktubar or 2 november ko elahabaad hycourt se jamaanat mil chuki he

 mishra kehete hai, ''rasuka kii karrwai achaanak nahin he
 It was proposed by SO Puttan Lal Verma of Dehat Kotwali and it reached the District Magistrate after the approval of SP City, SSP

 "but the matter does not seem to be limited to Chandrashekhar
 darasal chandrashekhar par rasuka kii karrwai tab kii gai jab uttar pradesh main nikaay chunaav prakriya prarambh ho chuki he or daliton ko jode bina koi bhi pramukh siyaasi dal mukaable main bana nahin rah saktaa
 UP Congress state vice president and former MLA Imran Masood, who stood in support of the Bhima Army and Chandrasekhar from the beginning, calls it an action taken under political malfeasance
 "the administration has mocked serious legislation like Rasuka
 sarkaar immergency jaise halaat paidaa karke loktantr kii aawaaj ko dabaane par amada he
 The Thakur accused of the first riots imposed rasuka on the youths and now disarmed Chandrasekhar to balance
 " rasuka main niruddh hone vaale chandrashekhar akele nahin hai, balki shabbirpur main daliton par hinsa karne ke aaropee teen thakur yuvakon sudhir, raju or sonu par 8 sitambar ko rasuka laga diya gaya tha
 Along with them, Rasuka's action was also against Shabbirpur chief Shiv Kumar and another youth Sonu among the accused of Dalit side
 lekin chandrashekhar ke maamle main intjaar kiya gaya
 The question is: On the basis of the charges in which Chandrasekhar got bail, why was he denied in Rasuka? "the BJP government does not want Chandrashekhar to come out of jail and fight for the rights of Dalits," says Satish Gautam do-tuk, a Bhima Sena leader
 unke baahar aane se nikaay chunaav main daliton ko bal milane kii ashanka se dari rajya sarkaar ne prashasnic mashinari kaa durupyog kiya he
 "though Rasuka orders from the state and central level standing councils are yet to be verified and the DM has to be responded to by the Chandrashekhar side within 12 days, but if the law experts are to be believed, this order will enable the police administration in future
 But will definitely raise questions
 darasal, nikaay chunaav kii aahat hote hi bhaajapa ne saharanpur main ek prayog kiya tha
 In April, under the leadership of BJP MP Raghav Lakhanpal Sharma, the Ambedkar procession was forcibly taken out in the village road Dudhli in the municipal area, which led to communal violence
 saansad tatkaaleen esaspi lav kumaar ke awaas par dharna dekar baith gaye the or unke samarthakon ne esaspi awaas main todfod kii thi
 The BJP did not get the support of the Dalits in this matter and the inverted MP also had to face the displeasure of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath
 saansad apane anuj rahul lakhanpal ko meyar kaa chunaav ladaana chaahate the
 But the chair of the first mayor of Saharanpur was reserved for the Backward Classes
 dalit matadaata yahaan nirnaayak hai
 Dalits vote not only here but on the politics of western Uttar Pradesh
 chandrashekhar kaa naam dalit asmita se jud chukaa he or jo dalit matadaataaon par asar daal saktaa he
 But the bjp's strategy of putting the Dalits in its fold backfired after the May 5, 2017 ethnic violence between Dalits and Thakurs in Shabbirpur village in Saharanpur
 us samay sthaneey esadm manoj singh ne shabbirpur ke padosi gaanv shimlana ke inter college ke ek kamare main maharana pratap jayanti manaane kii anumati di thi, lekin kisi juluus kii ijaajat nahin thi
 The event also had Sher Singh Rana, the killer of Phoolan Devi, who is on parole
 jhadap ke baad aasapaas ke gaanvon se shabbirpur main pahunchi thakuron kii bheed ne daliton par hamalaa kar diya tha
 More than fifty houses of Dalits were burnt and dozens of Dalits were injured
 dam ghutane se ek thakur yuvak kii maut ho gai thi
 In this case, Dalit politics came to consciousness when the Bhima Army came out
 naaraaz daliton ne jamkar virodh-pradarshan kiya tha
 Chandrasekhar challenged the state government by mobilizing a large crowd of Dalits at Jantar Mantar in Delhi on 21 May
 natijatan basapa pramukh mayawati ko bhi shabbirpur kaa daura karnaa padaa
 The Dalits returning from their meeting were also systematically attacked and a young man was killed
 18 july ko mayawati ne rajyasabha kii sadsyta se istipha dete hue kaha tha, ''main shoshiton, mazdooron, kisaanon or daliton ke utpeeda kii baat sadan main rakhana chaahati thi
 She wanted to raise the issue of Dalit oppression in Shabbirpur, but all the people of the ruling party stood together and i was not given a chance to speak
 " is maamle main basapa der se jaagi, balki use chandrashekhar ke nae dalit avatar ne jaagane par majaboor kiya
 By then, Congress state vice-president Imran Masood had supported Dalit sympathies by supporting Chandrashekhar
 haalanki congress ke rashtriya upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi shabbirpur kaa daura nahin kar paae or saharanpur pahunchane main ve mayawati se pichad gaye the
 Apparently, Dalits are on the electoral board under the pretext of Chandrasekhar and have a decisive role in the civic elections
 aise main chandrashekhar ko jinase khatra mahasoos ho rahaa he or unhen hi chandrashekhar se bhi khatra lag rahaa he
 At present, the action of Rasuka is yet to be verified in the State Standing Council, but the politics is again in full swing

 Bollywood actor Nawazuddin Siddiqui's reaction to his wife Alia has come to light after allegations of spying on his wife
 unhone fasebuk par post likhakar puure maamle par hairaani jataai he
 Alia wrote, i am surprised with Nawaz himself after seeing all the news that is going on in the media since yesterday
 pehle bhi mere or navaj ke bare main kai tarah kii baaten media main aati rahi hai
 In which many things were said, from divorce to not staying with us, but the news which has been spreading since yesterday has been a surprise for both of us and i was forced to break my silence today
 aalia ne aage likhaa, pichley dinon unki biography ko lekar bhi unki kaaphi aalochana hui thi
 Nawaz's father-in-law was just that he speaks the truth
 unke andar kahin koi jhooth nahin
 But instead of understanding them, they were mistaken
 meraa or navaj kaa rishta 15 saal purana he
 When Nawaz was nothing, our love story started from a small house had many ups and downs
 magar ek lambey relation ke baad aakhir hamane shaadi kar lee
 Nawaz also touched his career highs
 jo thodi bahut kami thi wo hamaare do bacchon shora or yani ke janm se puri ho gai
 Nawazuddin Siddiqui said in his Facebook post on the charge of spying on his wife, Alia wrote that Nawaz is a celebrity for the world today but for him he is still Nawaz
 unhone likhaa, mujhe navaj kii hameshaa se jo acchhee baat lagi wo he unka khule vichaaron kaa hona
 He gives as much space to others as he likes, and the biggest example of this is the religion of both of us
 unhone bataaya, main hindu brahman parivaar se hum, vahiin navaj ek muslim hai
 But Nawaz never let me feel that i belong to a different religion
 naa hi apane dharm ko mujhapar kabhi thopane kii koshish kii
 As much as they believe in their religion, they also give respect to my religion
 apane rishte kii majbootee kaa zikr karte hue unhone post main likhaa, yahi hamaare bich ek majboot rishte kii buniyaad rahi he
 This, along with a good husband and father, has made him a great man
 shaayad isliye celebrati hone ke baad bhi unpar kisi tarah kaa koi staradam haaavee nahin ho paaya
 He still has the same old friends today
 vahi chote-chote shauk hai
 That simple sea is his life
 aakhir main aalia ne likhaa, navaj aaj bhi vahi navaj hai
 The truth of this new contravention involving CDR will be revealed to everyone soon, i will only say here that the charges against Nawaz are completely false and baseless
 celibrity hone ke kaaran unhen soft target banaaya gaya he
 Nawaz criticized the attitude of the media, criticizing the attitude of the entire media on the whole matter, actor Nawaz called it disgusting
 unhone apni beti ke saath skool main samay bitaate hue ek tasviir soshal media par post karke apana paksh rakhaa
 Nawaz said, i am surprised that the media is questioning me about some allegations
 ghrunit
 Last evening, i was helping my daughter to prepare her school project Hydroelectric Power Generator & went to her school this morning for Project Exhibition
 To my surprise the media had questions about some random allegations on me # Disgustpic

 The new President of the country, Pranab Mukherjee has said that the fight against terrorism is the fourth world war and this world war is because it can raise its evil head anywhere in the world
 pranab ne sansad ke kendriya kaksh main bharat ke nae raashtrapati ke rup main shapath lene ke baad kaha, 
 
 
 The era of war is not over yet
 ham chauthe vishwayuddh ke bich main hai
 The Third World War was the Cold War, but by the time the war ended in the early 1990s, Asia, Africa and Latin America had a very hot climate by that time
 aatankwaad ke khilaaf ladaai chauthaa vishwayuddh he or yah vishwayuddh isliye he, kyonki yah buraai apana shaitani sir duniya main kahin bhi uthaa sakati he
 Chief Justice of India Justice SH Kapadia administered the oath of office to Pranab
 is dauraan uparashtrapati hamid ansaari, loksabhaa adhyaksh mira kumaar, pradhanmantri manmohan singh, upie adhyaksh sonia gandhi, endie ke kaaryvahak adhyaksh laalkrishna adwani, loksabhaa or rajyasabha main vipaksh ke netaa kramash: sushamaa swaraj or arun jetali, kendriya mantri, pradeshon ke rajyapal, rajyon ke mukhyamantri, vibhinn deshon ke bharat sthit rajdoot, saansad or anya ganmaanya hastiyaan maujuud thim
 Pranab said, other countries came to know about its (terrorism's) heinousness and dangerous consequences later, whereas India has to face this war much earlier than that
 pranab ne kaha ki bharat ke logon ne ghaavon kaa dard sehate hue paripakvata kaa udhaaharan prastut kiya he
 Those who incite violence and incite hatred must understand the truth
 varshon ke yuddh ke mukaable shanti ke kuch kshanon se kahin adhik uplabdhi praapt kii ja sakati he
 India is complacent and driven by the desire to sit on the highest peak of prosperity
 yah apane is mishan main aatankwaad failaane vaale khatarnaak logon ke kaaran vichlit nahin hoga
 As soon as Pranab Mukherjee completed the oath in a black grand achkan and white shackled churidar pajamas, everyone in the room welcomed him by thumping tables and clapping
 sena ne unhen 21 topon kii salaami di, jisaki aawaaj kendriya kaksh main saaf sunai de rahi thi
 Later, the President's bodyguards on horseback took him in a black limousine car to Rashtrapati Bhavan under his protection
 apane bhaashan main raashtrapati ne kaha ki garibi ke abhishaap ko khatm karnaa he or yuvaaon ke liye aise avasar paidaa karne hai, jisase ve hamaare bharat ko teevr gati se aage lekar jaaen
 There is no greater humiliation than hunger
 suvidhaon ko dhire-dhire neeche tak pahunchane ke siddhanton se garibon kii nyaaysangat aakankshaon kaa samaadhaan nahin ho saktaa
 We have to uplift those who are poorest, so that the word poverty is erased from the dictionary of modern India
 raashtrapati ne kaha ki hamaara vikaas vaastavik lage, iske liye jaruri he ki hamaare desh ke garib se garib vyakti ko mahasoos ho ki vah ubharate bharat kii kahani kaa ek hissaa he
 Later the Hindi translation of his speech was read by Vice President Hamid Ansari
 pranab ne kaha, meri raay main shiksha vah mantra he, jo bharat main aglaa swarna yug laa saktaa he
 In our oldest texts, the structure of society is erected on the pillars of knowledge
 hamaari chunauti he, gyaan ko desh ke har ek kone main pahunchaakar ise ek loktantric takat main badalanaa
 Talking about corruption, he said that sometimes the weight of the post falls on the dreams of the person
 bhrashtachar ek aisi buraai he, jo desh kii manodasha main niraashaa bhar sakati he or isaki pragati ko baadhit kar sakati he
 We cannot sacrifice our progress due to the greed of some people
 tippaniyan He ended the speech with the well-known metaphor of Swami Vivekananda, in which he said that India would rise
 sharir kii takat se nahin, balki man kii takat se
 Not from the flag of demolition, but the flag of peace and love
 achchhai kii sari shaktiyon ko ikattha karen
 Do not think what my color is
 
 
 haraa, nila athwa laal, balki sabhi rangon ko mila len or safed rang kii prakhar chamak paidaa karen, jo pyaar kaa rang he
 Pranab took the oath of office in English
 isse pehle raashtrapati bhawan se chalakar nivartmaan raashtrapati pratibha patil or pranab kaa kafila sansad bhawan parisar pahunchaa
 Upon reaching there, Kapadia, Ansari and Meera Kumar welcomed him and accompanied him to the Central Hall

 kahin baandh ko tuutane se bachaane kii jaddojahad he to kahin ganga kii tej dhar ke bich gaanv se nikalne or logon ko nikaalane kii koshish
 The struggle to deliver food to the families on the rooftops, then trying to take fodder to cattle, no one is willing to leave the house or no one is ready to go home because the Ganga has destroyed many settlements

 Many villages are found where people do not have boats, so the challenge is to catch the rope and cross the bay
 hridaipur ganwbaliya jile kaa hridaipur gaanv, ganga ke kinare baandh se sata he jahaan pani puure gaanv ko apni chapet main le chukaa he
 The edge of the river is so fast that if the foot slips then death is certain, people do not have the facility of boats so that people can come to the village
 aise main gaanvvaalon ne milakar nayab rasta nikaala taaki log gaanv se surakshit nikal sake
 People have tied thick ropes in the trees made on the way of the whole village, by holding the rope, the torrents of the river are being defeated

 daftar jane se pehle kya pahanen, kya nahin? khaanaa order karne se pehle kya mangaayen, kya nahin? rigerveshan hone ke baad jaaen yaa nahin? or sabase badi baat sambandhon ko lekar aap apni raay badalte rahete hai
 For example, a person liked you for some time (some days and months) and then your opinion about him changed
 khaastaur par prem sambandhon main aapkaa yah 'kanfusion' baari pad saktaa he
 Relationship therapists see this as a bell of danger for relationships
 or yah tab or zyada khatarnaak he jabaki aap ek hi vyakti se baar-baar brake-ap karen
 Even if it is not done and it is not endured, it looks good only in films
 manovigyaan main aapke is ravaie ko 'ricycling relationships' kaha jaataa he
 Just be careful, this confusion in real life can ruin your life
 agar in saare kanfusion se aap din-maheene-saal ke saath guzar rahe hai to ise hansi majaak main nahin balki gambhirtha se lenaa chahie
 Sometimes if you feel like this then it does not matter, but if this confusion has become a part of your everyday life, then you should find its solution as soon as possible
 manovigyaan main is avasthaa ko dilarium yani 'acute kanfusion state' yaa 'acute brain syndrome' kehete hai
 Dr
 has written many articles about emotions
 mairi si limia kahati hai, '' agar aap ek hi vyakti se yaa phir alag-alag vyaktiyon se baar-baar brallep karte hai or phir unhen manaane main jute jate hai to is sambandh par aapako gaharaai se sochna chahie
 But you need to think more than that about your emotions being unstable
 aapkaa mastishk kanfusion kaa shikaar to nahin
 "actually, there are two emotions born in fear and anger when there is Confusion"
 is udhaaharan ko aise samajhe, jaise aap ek car kharidne jate hai
 You don't like its color lekin aapke dost aapako kehete hai ki dekh bhai is brands kii yah aakhri gaadi he
 If you miss then you will have to wait for months
 aapke upar dabaav he ki apane naapsandgi ko ek maukey ke rup main tabdeel kar den
 You buy that car for fear of losing it, but what about the anger that was born due to not getting the color of your choice
 gaahe-bagaahe aapako apni pasand ke rang kii gaadi kii yaad aati rahegi or kahin agar us rang kii gaadi aap kisi or ke paas dekhenge to khud kii gaadi ke prati kshanik hi sahi thodaa khiz paidaa hogi
 The same thing happens in relationships
 aapane kisi ke pyaar main agar kisi dar yaa dabaav kii vajah se pade hai to aap uske saath sthir imoshan ke saath nahin rah paaenge
 If anger dominates, you will break up with it and then fear of choicelessness will arise, then it will have to be celebrated
 kai baar aap ek chhod duusare or phir duusare chhod tisare or phir na jane kitne brake-ap relationships se guzrenge
 Confusion is not a mountain that will not break
 
 
 kanfusion se upje dar or gusse ko dabaane kii jagah uskaa gaharaai se vishleshan karne kii jarurat he
 Obviously you will not be able to do it yourself, but if you are going through this phase of Confusion, then consult a psychologist
 kyonki dilarium yani 'acute kanfusion state' laailaaj nahin he
 Therapist will help you to feel real loving feeling by recognizing both fear and anger emotions

 Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Mulayam Singh Yadav, on Tuesday, accused Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) founder Lalu Prasad Yadav of doing political politics over the Muzaffarnagar riots and said that the government had given help to the riot victims Despite being aware of this, the opposition leaders are doing politics on this issue
 yadav ne samaajawaadee netaa rajanarayan kii 27veen punyatithi par sapa rajya mukhyalay par yojit samaaroh main kaha ki samaajawaadee log apni nitiyon ko chhodkar kahin nahin jate
 They do not want power except in policies, but RJD leader Lalu Prasad Yadav even became close to the BJP for power
 unhone lalu par tanj kasate hue kaha, 'sarkaar dwaara mujffarnagar danga peediton kii itani madad karne ke baavjood koi bhi aira-gairaa vahaan jaakar raajnneeti karata he
 Some people got out of jail and reached Muzaffarnagar directly
 lalu ne kaha tha ki mulaayam ko pradhanmantri nahin banane duungaa
 Lalu is engaged in the flattery of the Congress
 ab unke paas or kuch bachaa bhi nahin he
 ' yadav ne kaha ki desh main aazaadee ke baad se ab tak jitne bhi dange hue unamem se mujffarnagar peediton ko jitani madad di gai utani kabhi kisi sarkaar ne kisi danga peedit ko nahin di
 He said, 'no other government has ever given such compensation
 hamane 90 karod rupye to ek saath baant diye
 Opposition leaders know all this but still they are doing politics
 ' Describing the upcoming Lok Sabha elections as the most appropriate opportunity to put SP in power at the Center, the party chief told the workers, "the people are the real power
" aap janata ke bich jaaie
 You cannot make Mulayam prime minister by ignoring him
 ' Yadav said that power is worshiped only in politics, no one worships the weak
 isaliye sapa kii takat ko badhaao
 The SP chief said that China has entered the Indian border up to 19 km inside
 kendra sarkaar darpok he
 When there is a security meeting, nobody says anything
 pakistan hamaare jawan kaa sir kaat le gaya
 Apart from this, the government has also failed on the front of preventing inflation and corruption
 unhone doharaaya ki aagaamee loksabhaa chunaav main bhaajapa ko kuch badhat to milegi lekin vah sarkaar nahin bana sakegi, kyonki uske saath koi or dal nahin he
 After the elections, only the third front will come to power at the center
 yadav ne samaajawaadee netaa rajanarayan ke vyaktitv par bhi prakaash daalate hue kaha ki unhone jivan bhar anyaay ke khilaaf sangharsh kiya
 He used to give attractive speeches
 vah vicitra vyaktitv ke the or unase prerana lene kii jarurat he
 He said that Rajnarayan defeated Indira Gandhi in the election
 desh ko ahm yogadan diya tha
 No one can become a big leader without taking risks
 is maukey par mukhyamantri or sapa ke prantiya adhyaksh akhilesh yadav ne kaha ki loktantr ko sirf samaajawaadee log hi takat de rahe hai
 Being in power, they also face challenges
 tamaam aise log hai jinka hamen muqabla karnaa hoga
 He said that all socialists should try to increase the power of socialism by spreading to other states besides Uttar Pradesh
 samaajawaadee log hi rasta dikhaa sakate hai
 Akhilesh said that the previous Mayawati government of the state had destroyed the cooperative movement and destroyed the Panchayati Raj
 sapa ne satta main aate hi unhen punerjeevit kiya he
 The cooperative banks which were closed were reopened
 unhone kaha 'loksabhaa chunaav ke liye ab do-teen maheene hi bache hai
 If we succeed in the Lok Sabha elections, then we will be successful in forming the next government in the state
 hamaari-aapaki jimmedaari badi he
 
 
 We cannot succeed unless all our companions fight together
 agar sapa ko badi takat bananaa he to loksabhaa chunaav bahut bada mauka he
 ' mukhyamantri ne dilli main sattarudh aam aadmi party (aap) par tanj kasate hue kaha 'haal main ek akhbaar main cartoon chapa tha ki dilli main ek party he jo chauraahey par khadi he, or vah esemes karke janata se puch rahi he ki kis raste par jaaen
 Such people have also come into politics
