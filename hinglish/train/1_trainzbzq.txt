 During the heated debate over the Liberhan report in Parliament, the process of accusation continued
 congress party ke saansad jagdambika paal ne bijepi par aarope lagaaya ki vah ramanaam kaa galat istemaal kar rahi he
 On the other hand, BJP President Rajnath Singh termed the report of Liberhan Commission as misleading report and said that this report is inspired by politics

 Taking part in a special discussion that started in the Lok Sabha on the report of the Commission today, BJP President Rajnath Singh strongly objected to the former Prime Minister Vajpayee being described as pseudo-liberal in the report, saying that he would be called a person with a sick mindset
 unhone kaha ki vaajapeyi se ayog ne poochtacha tak nahin kii or un par anaavashyak tippaniyan karke gaiyr-kanoonee kaam kiya he
 He said that the entire report is a political document and a character violation
 pehle se nishkarsh nikaal liye gaye or uske liye tathy or sakshya talaashe gaye
 The party president said that the Commission, which has not visited Ayodhya even once during the 17 years of investigation, can hear the verdict about the demolition of the controversial structure
 unhone vyangy main kaha ki sanjay aap kis dhritarashtra ko yah sab sunaanaa chaahate hai
 Expressing strong objections to Vajpayee, Advani and Murali Manohar Joshi in the report, they said that it was not the commission's job to make such comments
 yah rapat swasth or nishpaksh niyat se nahin balki doshaaropan kii niyat se taiyaar kii gai he
 At the same time, senior Congress leader Jagdambika Pal said that BJP is only doing politics on this issue and it is not serious about temple construction

 Before the court, Jethmalani had said that summons had been issued to his client and other accused, but this does not mean that charges should also be framed against him
 ek aaropee ke bayaan ko duusare aaropee ke bayaan ke taur par nahin dekha ja saktaa

 The ideas of Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) belong to prehistoric times, have no serious ideology, and include some of the poorest people across the country
 
 
 yah kahana he kendriya videshmantri or congress ke varisht netaa salmaan khurshid kaa
 During a special conversation with NDTV about the Aam Aadmi Party running the government with the support of the Congress in Delhi, the foreign minister said, "kejriwal's 'AAP' includes the lowest-ranking people across the country
 
 
 main bahut-se jilon main gaya, jahaan maine sabase zyaada 'badboodaar' logon ko sabase pehle 'aap' main shaamil hote hue dekha
 
 
 i know how much rot there is in 'you'
 
 
 ve khushnaseeb hai ki aajkal prayek badboo ko bhi khushboo mana ja rahaa he
 
 
 In just 15 days, he has spoiled the image of himself in the mind of every sensible person, and has put a question mark on the integrity of our country by saying that Kashmir should be handed over to the neighboring country of Pakistan
 
 
 " It came into existence only a year ago, and this is the first time for the Aam Aadmi Party, which has been credited with almost completely wiping out the Congress in the recent Delhi Assembly elections, when it faced such severe criticism from any Congress leader
 Had to do
 darasal, dilli ke vidhansabha chunaav parinaamon se utsahit hokar hi 'aap' ne lagbhag teen maheene ke bheetar desh main hone ja rahe loksabhaa chunaav ladane kaa man banaaya he

 Salman Khurshid said, "his ('you') ideas belong to prehistoric times, and they smell of chaos
 
 
 samay ke saath or dheron pareekshanon ke baad sthapit kii gai har chiz kii ve aalochana karte hai, use nicha dikhaate hai
 
 
 They raise questions about anything, discredit it, and then when they find that they can't handle the crowd, they run away, and climb on the roofs and scream
 
 
 " Salman Khurshid also retaliated by Arvind Kejriwal's statement that the fight in the 2014 general election is only between 'AAP' and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and the Congress is nowhere in the fight
 
 
 videshmantri ne kaha, "darasal, 'aap' daud main nahin he
 
 
 Forget about where we (congress) are
 
 
 yah unki galatfahami he, agar ve samajhate hai ki ve daud main hai
 
 
 They are running the government in Delhi only because we (congress) are supporting them
 
 
 " Criticizing Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal for defining everything and the system in his own way and making his own rules, Salman Khurshid said, "the sooner he (arvind Kejriwal) realizes what he really is , And what their limitations are, would be better for them

 The producers are making a lot of pressure on him to make 'dangal' sequel and they are saying that if he does not want to make a sequel, then at least make another film based on sports
 tiwari ne 'dangal' kii safalataa kaa shrey kai kaarnon ko diya he
 He said, "I think the sincerity and seriousness with which 'dangal' has been made has proved to be effective
" film ko jitna vakt chahie tha, iske liye jitne prayaas karne chahie the or jis str par ise bananaa chahie tha, hamane sabakuch uske anuroop kiya

 nirmaataa unpar 'dangal' kaa sikval banane kaa bahut dawaab bana rahe hai or ve kah rahe hai ki yadi vah sikval nahin bananaa chaahate to kam se kam khel par aadhaarit koi duusari film hi banaaen
 Tiwari attributes the success of 'dangal' to several reasons
 unhone kaha, "mujhe lagata he ki jis eemaandaaree or gambhirtha ke saath 'dangal' ko banaaya gaya he, vah kargar sabit hua he
 The amount of time that the film needed, the amount of effort it should have done and the level at which it should have been made, we did everything according to it
 " Tiwari said about the film, "we wrote the story of this film and shot it so that the audience would get a story between it and ourselves
 kirdaar or unki bhaawanaaon ko bilkul vaastavik rakhaa gaya, or film main jo hasya kaa put joda gaya, usase yah film adhik mjedaar ban gai
 " unhone kaha, "yah sone par suhaaga jaisaa he ki log na sirf film pasand kar rahe hai, balki ise banane main lagi mehnat ko mahasoos kar rahe hai or uski prashansa kar rahe hai

 This highway, spanning 125 kilometers, is also becoming notorious as a 'road of death'
 ghabrie nahin, is rajmarg ko koi shaap nahin mila he or na hi is par koi manîsa chaaya he balki yah prashasnic laaparvaahee kaa shikaar he
 And because of this, eight people have lost their lives in the last 20 days

 Not only Pakistan but the whole world is disgusted by the terror attack in Peshawar
 bharat kii sarkaar hi nahin, yahaan ke bachche-bachche tak is dard kaa ahsaas pahunchaa he
 But on the other hand, those who harbor terror in Pakistan have raised the same old rag again under the government's nose
 besharmi kii had hoti he
 We are encouraging Pakistan to fight against terror by participating in the sorrow of Pakistan and Hafiz Saeed, the main accused in the Mumbai attack, is blaming India for the attack in Army School of Peshawar
 hairaani kii baat ye he ki peshawar hamale ke baad paak piem navaj sharif ne aatankwaad kaa khaatmaa karne kaa elaan kiya, lekin pakistan kii sarajameen se hi bharat ke khilaaf aatanki sajeesh rachi ja rahi he
 The IB has issued an important alert regarding the intentions of Hafiz Saeed
 khabar he ki wo obama ke bharat daure ke bich hamale kii sajeesh rach rahaa he
 Hafiz Saeed, who led many terror attacks in India, has taken refuge under the patronage of the same Pakistan government which is taking the vow to disarm terrorism
 ibi ke mutabik 15 janvari tak kabhi bhi desh kii rajdhani dilli or aarthik rajdhani mumbai main aatanki kisi vaardaat ko anjaam de sakate hai
 Can target targets such as big hotels and railway stations of the country
 ye sab ho rahaa he peshawar main hue hamale ke do din baad hi
 Unbelievable why Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who sheds tears on Peshawar attack, is adopting a double character on the issue of terrorism? On one hand, the Pakistani PM declares to fight terrorism in front of the whole world and on the other hand, terrorist leader Hafiz Saeed is also seen for his sake
 pakistani sarkaar aatankwaad ke mudde par kitni gambhir he yah uske doglepan se saaf ho jaataa he
 His promises to fight terrorism are false and meaningless

 gujarat, rajasthan, uttar pradesh sahit 10 rajyon kii 33 vidhaan sabha siton or 3 loksabhaa kii siton par hue upachunaav ke parinaam saamne hai
 These are disappointing for the BJP and in a way a push for the party in Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh
 rajasthan or uttar pradesh main party ne loksabhaa chunaav main jo jalawaa dikhaaya tha, vah kaaphi had tak gaayab he
 In Rajasthan, the party lost three seats while only one seat went to its account
 yah mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje ke liye bada dhakka he or unhen is paraajay ke baad aage ke bare main sochna padegaa
 However, she can say that the margin of victory of the Congress in all these seats is very low
 lekin haar haar hi hoti he or usamen margin kaa koi myne nahin he
 But the BJP high command will have to rethink its strategy about Uttar Pradesh
 vahaan samaajawaadee party ne bahujan samaaj party kii anupasthiti main prabhaavshaalee jeet darj kii he
 It registered its presence in nine seats while the BJP, which won 70 seats in the Lok Sabha elections, got just two seats
 mainpuri loksabhaa seat par jaisi ki ummid thi mulaayam ke bhai ke pote ne jeet darj kii
 Some of these seats were such that it was anticipated that they would go to BJP, went to SP
 bijepi ke liye yah bada dhakka he kyonki vahaan party kii nigahen lakhanu ke singhaasana par he
 But these election results may shatter his dreams
 inase itnaa sanket to miltaa he ki party pehle jaisi majboot nahin rahi or vahaan sanghathan str par kaaphi kuch karne kii jarurat he
 Amit Shah's magic and Modi's name did not work for the party
 vaise bhi vidhaan sabha chunaav main hameshaa sameekaran or mudde alag hote hai
 But the party can be satisfied that it has finally stepped into Bengal
 vahaan loksabhaa chunaav main bhale hi use siten nahin mili thim lekin vidhaan sabha main usne ek seat par jeet hasil karke ek nayaa adhyay likhaa
 It is also a win for Silchar in Assam
 gujarat ke parinaam party ke liye santosh kaa sabab ban sakate hai lekin usase khushi nahin mil sakati
 However, the matter will not end here
 in parinaamon se sapa kaa manobal badhegaa jisane bina kuch kiye hi itani sari vidhaan sabha siten jeet leen
 The party did not improve its performance nor did it do anything to turn voters towards it
 iskaa matlab saaf he ki bijepi ke prati logon kaa rujhaan kam hua he or modi lahar ab vahaan nahin he
 This may not be worrying for the party, but it will have to be considered and how long will the party sit on the backing of Modi wave? Obviously, after the Bihar elections, the results of Uttar Pradesh must have once pushed the party high command
 use aatm vishleshan karnaa hoga or rajya sanghathanon ke adhyakshon ko nae sire se chintan karnaa hoga
 maharashtra-haryana elections have come and the party cannot afford to be lazy
 yah dhakka party kii neend khone ke liye shaayad kaaphi hoga

 Newly appointed chairman of the National Scheduled Castes Commission, Congress MP P
P
 el
 Punia said on Thursday that for the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh Mayawati, who describes herself as the messiah of Dalits, the welfare of Dalits was neither a priority nor a priority
 kabhi mayawati ke behad kareebi naukarshah rahe puniya ne kaha ‘mayawati darasal raajnneetik shaks hai, saamaajik nahin
 Dalits have never been her priority and neither are they today
 ’ unhone daawa kiya ‘jab main mukhyamantri mayawati kaa pramukh sachiv tha tab bhi unhone mujhase daliton ke kalyaan ke vaaste yojana banane ke liye ek baar bhi nahin kaha
 He stopped the traditional program of meeting the public
 yah janata ke prati unke upekshaatmak ravaiye ko darshata he
 'punia said that Uttar Pradesh has the highest incidence of Dalit oppression in the country and the number of such incidents in this state is also increasing at a faster pace than other states
 unhone kaha ki daliton ke liye banaai gai yojanaon kaa uttar pradesh main kriyanvayan nahin ho rahaa he, kyonki sarkaar aisa karnaa hi nahin chaahati
 Punia said that as per the provision, 16 per cent of the total budget should be allocated to the Scheduled Castes and eight per cent to the Scheduled Tribes, but it is not fully implemented and the money that is received is also used for the welfare of these backward classes
 Is not done
 puniya ne ek sawaal ke jawaab main kaha ‘daliton ke kalyaan ke liye aavantit dhan se medical kalege or sadaken banaai ja rahi hai
 this is wrong
 congress shasit rajyon main hi nahin balki har soobe main aisa ho rahaa he
 "he said" the commission will now ensure the allotment for Dalits and with that money only plans will be prepared for Dalits
 maine pradhanmantri manmohan singh se bhi is bare main baat kii he
 Punia said that it is his priority to ensure a separate allocation of 24 percent for the Dalits in the Special Component Plan and the budget so that the real benefit of the funds allocated for the upliftment of Dalits can reach this lower section
 unhone kaha ki kendra sarkaar anusuchit jati ayog ke saath sahyog kar rahi he or bhavishya main chijen behatar hone kii ummid he
 On the question about the claims of increase in incidents of Dalit oppression in Uttar Pradesh in the last three years by the state government, the former IAS officer said that the state government is lying
 maine tathyon par aadhaarit baat kii he
 The statistics on Dalit oppression testify to my claims
 ’unhone mana ki daliton main julm ke khilaaf aawaaj uthaane kii himmat paidaa hui he, jis kaaran dalit utpeedan kii vaardaat main ijapha hua, lekin yah bhi sach he ki dalit utpeedan kii adhikansh report to darj hi nahin hotin
 Punia said, 'the truth is that only 10 percent cases of atrocities on Dalits are reported as police reports
 unamem se bhi aadhe jabaran sulah-samjhauta karakar nipta diye jate hai
 If every report of Dalit oppression is filed then the picture will be even more vicious
 ’unhone kaha ki ayog kaa yah kartavya he ki vah daliton ke liye yojanaon ke nirmaan main apni raay de or anya jaruri madad bhi kare
 The former IAS officer said on another question that sentencing is not the work of the commission
 vah sirf utpeedan kii vaardaat kii jaanch karke karrwai kii sifarish kar saktaa he
 However, the commission will now try to complete the investigation of the cases of Dalit harassment within 30 days and file a chargesheet
 puniya ne kaha ki daliton ke liye gathit adaalaton main daliton se jude maamalon kaa praathamikta se nistaaran karne ko bhi tarjeeh di jaaegi
 He said that in the courts set up for Dalits, cases of Dalits are often pending, so we want only the cases of Dalits to be heard in these courts
 unhone kaha ki is vakt desh main ayog ke 12 karyaalay sanchalit kiye ja rahe hai
 Commission offices will soon be opened at eight places including Jaipur, Bhopal and Bhubaneswar

 Dhoni said after India's 95-run win over England in the fifth and final ODI last night, the wicket looked somewhat dysfunctional
 bharat ne pehle ballebaaji karte hue aath wicket par 271 ran banaaye or phir england ko 176 ran par samet diya
 He said, to some extent it seemed a useless wicket
 aap is tarah ke wicket par tikkar nahin khel sakate ho or is par ran bananaa aasaan nahin tha
 We were lucky to be able to score 270 runs on such a wicket
 dhoni ne kaha, hamane to 240 se 245 ran tak pahunchane ko apana lakshya banaaya tha
 We had two good partnerships in the middle and later Ravinder Jadeja and Praveen Kumar gave good support
 dhoni ne kaha, main aakhir tak tike rahanaa chahta tha or jab bhi mujhe mauka miltaa boundry lagane kii koshish kar rahaa tha
 If not possible, he would have tried to take a run

 The fierce battle with the leaders who can support the post-elections widens the gap between mathematics and reality for the NDA government led by Modi
 kshetreey dalon ke kai netaaon ne modi ko satta main aane se rokna jaruri bataaya he
 Whatever be the reason for this, the increasing distance between Modi and the allies who can come together after the election has given the Congress a chance to jump back into the sport that the BJP was playing till now
 baaki dalon ke liye bhi tisare vikalp kii ummid jinda ho gai he or chunaav ke baad sahyogiyon ko jodgaye kii daud shuru ho chuki he
 The 10-year-old UPA government led by the Congress is riding an anti-incumbency wave and the BJP hopes to emerge as the single largest party after the elections
 kathith modi lahar ke baavjood bijepi kaa aantarik surveykshan maanata he ki 28 dalon kaa maujuuda endie 250 kaa aankada hi chhu paaegaa
 "we estimate that it will get around 200 seats on its own, while the remaining 27 partners will collect 50 seats," says a party general secretary
 iske baad phone uthaate hi sahyogiyon kii line lag jaaegi
 “the best performance of the bjp's heavy party for power was in 1999 with 182 seats
 us saal endie ne 298 siten jiti thim jabaki congress or uske sahyogi 136 siten hi juta paae the
 After losing the allies, the condition of the BJP in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections was diluted and it had to be satisfied with only 116 seats
 uski vot hissedari bhi 22
 18 down from 16 per cent
 8 fisadi rah gai
 In this election, the BJP adopted a dual strategy — a highly Modi-centric campaign with the aim of raising maximum seats for itself and alliances with more and more political parties to convey the message that the party under Modi's leadership is not untouchable
 bijepi netaaon kaa tark he ki agar ramvilas paswan or en
 Chandrababu Naidu can join bjp's hand and others can come together
 paswan kii lok janashakti party ko vaise to chunaav main ek-do seat milane kaa hi anumaan he par bijepi uske endie main aane ko badi baari naitik jeet maanati he, kyonki paswan ne 2002 main gujarat dange ke mudde par hi endie choda tha
 There are many parties in the current NDA that never won the Lok Sabha elections
 inamen se saat partiyon ne to ek bhi seat par ummidavaar tak khadaa nahin kiya
 The current members of the NDA today have only 125 seats
 bijepi ko lagata he ki yah pehla chunaav ho saktaa he jisamen garib or pichde virgon kaa voter congress or uske saathiyon kaa haath chhodkar bijepi kaa daaman tham saktaa he
 He also hopes that many people who vote for the first time will break the caste bond
 tamaam koshishon ke baavjood agar maujuuda endie 250 kaa aankada paar nahin kar paaya to bhi use kuch ahm sahyogiyon kaa saath milane kii ummid he
 The BJP also hopes to bring the Biju Janata Dal back to the NDA in Odisha
 mukhyamantri naveen patnayak vidhansabha chunaav main bahut kam bahumat se satta main waapas aa sakate hai yaa sarkaar banane ke liye unhen bijepi kii jarurat bhi pad sakati he
 It could also be that BJP Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J
 jayalalita kaa saath paane kii koshish kare yaa phir chunaav ke baad ganit aisa ho ki jayalalita ko bijepi kii jarurat pad jaae
 The AIADMK has been out of the central government for the last 15 years and its rival DMK has been a participant in every central government since 1999
 isliye jayalalita kii party ke liye yah chunaav bahut ahm he
 Apart from regaining the INLD of Om Prakash Chautala in Haryana and the Assam Gana Parishad in Assam, the BJP also hopes that it will join the NDA if a Telangana Rashtra Samithi government is formed in Telangana
 india today group or sisero ke surveykshanon ke mutabik, endie kii sarkaar banane ke asaar bahut zyada hai (anumaan 1 or 2) jabaki upie agar apana behtareen pradarshan bhi kare to bhi 272 ke aankade se bahut dur rah jayega (anumaan 3)
 According to poll analysts and BJP surveys on the non-bjp front, the Congress will be reduced to around 100 seats, but India's oldest party feels that its stars have risen in the last four months
 party ke aantarik surveykshan ke mutabik use 75 se adhik siten nahin milane vaali thim lekin bijepi ne jis tarah se jabardast congress virdohi lahar ko modi lahar main badalane kii koshish kii, usase congressiyon ko lagata he ki modi ke ird-gird ghoomte media ke shor ne congress virdohi bhaawanaaon kii dhar kuch kamjor kar di he
 According to a Congress leader from the war room, "our latest poll after the fourth phase of voting shows that we will cross the 130 mark
" ” party ne 437 ummidavaar khadey kiye hai or sutron kaa anumaan he ki 262 siton par vah mukaable main he jinamein se 155 siton par party khaas focus kar rahi he
 The party's electoral think tank is also working on the post-outcome options
 inamen samaan vichaardhaara vaale dalon ke gathbandhan ko samarthan dene se lekar upie-3 main shaamil hone tak saare vikalp shaamil hone or vampanthi dalon ke netritv main 13 dalon ke tisare morche ke vishaal gathbandhan tak ke saare vikalp shaamil hai
 The party is making all efforts to stop the bjp's growing move from forming alliances
 samaajawaadee party ke netaa ramgopal yadav ne bataaya, ''agar jarurat padi to bijepi ko satta hathiyaane se rokane ke liye ham congress kaa saath de sakate hai
 "after May 16, the role of the Congress will not only depend on how many seats it can save in the anti-incumbency wave, but it will also have to see how many leaders of Modi will be angry if the bjp's projections prove hollow

 English is a subject in which you can bring good marks
 kyonki isamen aapako kisi bhi tarah kaa formula aplai nahin karnaa padataa
 Board Exams: In this way, we will solve English paper and give good numbers to pay attention to these things
 
 
 - english kaa exam lanbaa hota he, isliye shuru ke 15 minute paper ko achche se padhein or samay ko dhyaan main rakhte hue sabhi prashn baant len
 - If you are going to give English exam then you must have a grip on 'english Grammar', even if you have written it correctly, but a slight mistake in the Grammar can force the examiner to cut marks
 - sawaal main jitna poocha jaae sirf utana hi likhen
 There is no need to write a story
 aapkaa jawaab ksaa hua hona chahie
 Do not over-write at all
 
 
 - other kaa naam jarur yaad rakhen
 BOARD EXAM: Do not eat before the exam, this food is a three-hour exam, so you manage time so that your exam is done in 2 hours and 45 minutes
 aakhri ke 15 minute ansar shit ko achche se padhein or dekhe koi galati naa hui ho
 Pay special attention to writing and write clearly
 hadabadi main aisa bilkul bhi naa likhen, jo ejaminner ko bhi samaj naa aae
 - This mantra is going to work in every exam, not in English exam
 isliye bina kisi tension ke relex hokar exam den
 Because you also know that the result is now dependent on your performance

 unki ore se 8 farvari, 2011 ko di gai ek arji main daleel di gai he ki dilli police dwaara daayar chargeshit aadhi-adhuri jaanch par aadhaarit he
 On the other hand, the Home Ministry argues that it has merely taken forward the advice given by the Legal Affairs Cell of the Law Ministry

 Defending Chidambaram on the charge of lobbying Gupta in the court, he wrote, "the Home Minister did not go to court after May 2004
" itnaa samay biit jane ke baad ab unhen yaad nahin ki 2004 se pehle unhone is maamle main gupta kii pairvi kii thi yaa nahin
 "on the other hand, Vice President of VLS Finance Harsh Alagh claims that the Ministry of Home Affairs has misinterpreted the opinion of the Law Ministry in this matter
 alagh kaa kahana he, ''kanoon mantralay ne yah kabhi nahin kaha ki exiar waapas lee ja sakati he
 Rather, he had suggested not to do so, in this case, the option of using Section 321 of the Criminal crpc remains
 ''vidhi vibhaag ne 18 march or 20 april ko likhe apane patr main grih mantralay ko jawaab diya, ''chunki adaalatein amuman jaanch ke dauraan dakhal nahin deteen, aise main gupta ke prativednon ke aadhaar par koi kadam uthaanaa uchit nahin hoga
 "not only this, the status report submitted by the Delhi Police states that it has also submitted the charge sheet and supplementary charge sheet in this case to the court and all the three cases are at different points of investigation

 But Saxena has clearly written in his letter that this decision was taken with the approval of the Home Minister

 Saxena's letter said, "the Home Department of the Delhi government should initiate an immediate inquiry into the firs to withdraw the case in cases filed by the Delhi Police

 Everyone knows how Bollywood actor Salman Khan and Vivek Oberoi have a relationship
 lekin aaj ham aapako bataane ja rahe hai us kahani ke bare main jahaan se donon ke rishton main khatas aani shuru hui thi
 It is said about superstars Salman Khan and Vivek Oberoi that the two fought badly due to Aishwarya Roy
 haalanki, nateeja ye niklaa ki donon ne apane rishte kharaab kar liye or aishwarya kii shaadi abhishek bachchan se ho gai
 Actually, Vivek Oberoi himself had revealed in a press conference about the quarrel with Salman Khan
 salmaan khan ko is baat kaa ehsaas tha ki aishwarya raay ke saath unka rishta khatm ho chukaa he, lekin phir bhi vah is rishte ko jinda karnaa chaahate the
 It was all going on that Vivek came into Aishwarya's life
 donon hi bollywood ke dabang actor the or aishwarya ko lekar donon aapas main bhid gaye
 Aishwarya, who was in a relationship with Salman Khan, was sad
 vivek oberoi unki jindagi main ummid kii kiran banakar aae the
 However, trouble ensued when Salman got the news about Vivek and Aishwarya and one night Salman Khan called Vivek Oberoi
 vivek ne ek conference main un 41 phone colls ke bare main bataaya jo salmaan ne us raat kii thim
 Along with this, Vivek also put the messages of Salman Khan in front of everyone, in which he threatened to beat Vivek publicly and kill him
 vivek ne salmaan ko kaaphi kuch kaha or baton-baton main hi vivek ne salmaan ko khuleam chalange kar diya
 Vivek thought that maybe Aishwarya would support him but it happened the opposite
 vivek ko na sirf aishwarya se bahut kuch sunanaa padaa balki salmaan ke gusse kaa lava bhi un par foot padaa
 While Salman Khan is at the peak of his career today, Vivek Oberoi only gets a few films
 salmaan ke gusse kaa kahar aisa tha ki bahut se nirmaataa nirdeshkon ne vivek ko kaam dena hi band kar diya

 While a separate dress has been made for the West Indies tour

 India has taken a 1-0 lead in the five-match ODI series by defeating the Windies by 105 runs in the second ODI match played at Rondatim India, West Indies, Queens Park Oval, Port of Spain

 The new party came to power, and the second major task it did after coming to the throne was a large number of administrative changes

 'surgery' is done to correct any defect
 zaahir he, isse aisa lagata he ki inke aane se pehle prashasan main jo log the, ve sahi nahin the
 Now they are being placed whereabouts (useless positions), as a person in conversation said a little shyly, "first their people rubbed, now it is the turn of our people
 
 
 "satta ke saath prashasan ke sambandh ke bare main sthanantaran ke is drushtikon par bahut samvedansheeltaa ke saath vichaar kiye jane kii zarurat he, kyonki unki yah karrwai hamaare ucchadhikariyon kii karypranali or yahaan tak ki unki satyanishtha kii par bhi anguli uthaati he, basharte unka drushtikon sahi ho
 The political leadership considers this 'mass transfer' to be an essential process for the selection of its 'favorite' officers, so that their electoral commitments can be fulfilled, and the relations between the minister and the administration are maintained
 isse kaam achche se chalata rahata he
 Actually, this idea in itself is completely against the democratic administrative system
 rajaneta prashasan ko vidhi sambandhi netritv (aadesh) maatr detaa he, or prashasan is netritv ko sweekaar karke us aadesh ko sthapit vidhiyon ke frem main lagu karata he
 Certainly, these orders (written) by ministers can only be within the scope of the constitution, but here the duality is not of written orders but of invisible orders which cannot be given in writing
 yaheen par ye 'tathakthith feverable adhikari', jinhen sammanjanak bhashaa main 'yogya, sakasham evam sakriy' adhikari kaha jaataa he, unke kaam aate hai
 Similar alliances put a black spot on the forehead of democracy by causing a variety of rules-based actions
 anyathaa, jahaan tak prashasan ke adhikariyon kii baat he, britain kii tarj par unase spasht rup se 'raajnneetik tatasthta' kii na keval ummid kii jaati he, balki yah unke liye anivaary he
 This neutrality of officials instills a sense of trust in the administration of the three important sections of the nation
 janata ke man main isse yah bhav nirmit hota he ki adhikari varg raajnneetik dabaav se mukt hokar (donon hi ore se) uskaa kaam karegaa
 The ministers themselves also get confidence from this that they will get full loyalty of public servants
 tatasthta kii yah niti civil sevakon main yah vishwaas banaae rakhkar prashasan ko kushal banaae rakhti he ki unka kariyar unki yogyata par aadhaarit he, raajnneetik manyataon par nahin
 The action of 'administrative surgery', unfortunately, deeply hurt these basic beliefs
 yadi kuch apwaadon ko chhod diya jaae, to shesh civil sevak 'raajnneetik tatasthta' kii maryaada kaa paalan karte hi hai
 If an officer, with his special ability and tact, works with a minister amicably for a relatively long period of time, it would be a terrible mistake to assume that officer's loyalty to that minister's political party
 aisa maanakar satta dal na keval us yogya adhikari ke kaaryon ke laabh se hi samaaj ko vanchit karata he, balki adhikariyon ke naitik manobal ko kamazor bhi karata he
 At the same time, this 'steel frame' of the nation will also lose its strength and perseverance, which ultimately will not be beneficial to the country at all
 azaadi ke baad centre evam rajyon main lagaataar satta-parivartan hote rahe hai, lekin aise anek udhaaharan maujuud hai, jab is parivartan ne prashasan main koi parivartan nahin kiya
 a good example of this can be presented of Narendra Modi becoming Prime Minister
 unke pradhanmantri banane par jo cabinet secretary (desh kaa sarvocch naukarshah) the, unka kaarykaal keval ek maah bachaa tha
 But he was given an extension in service
 pradhanmantri karyaalay ke nideshkon evam sanyukt sachivon ne apana-apana kaarykaal puraa kiya
 This attitude towards public servants is in harmony with the words of the country's first Home Minister Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, who addressed the first batch of admitted in independent India at Metcoff House on April 21, 1949, saying 'civil servants are instruments of government
 Huh
 unki nishtha rajya ke prati hoti he
 It is up to the governments how they use them
 
 
 ' gyatavya ho ki jis taarikh ko sardaar patel ne ye shabd kahe the, usee taarikh ko hamaara yah desh 'civil sarvice diwas' ke rup main manaata he
 True persuasion will take place in implementing those ideas
 bharat ke purv captain sunil gavaskar ne ravivaar ko kaha ki england ke khilaaf chauthe test ke liye tej gendbaaj jahir khan ko baahar karnaa apekshit he, jabaki harbhajan singh or yuvaraj singh ko bali kaa bakra banaaya gaya he
 Asked about the team selected for the last Test, Gavaskar said, "if i am asked, Zaheer Khan was sure to be out but Yuvraj Singh and Harbhajan Singh have been made scapegoats
 ’unhone kaha, ‘mumbai main harbhajan ne 20 over main do wicket liye the
 If India loses, then everyone was responsible for it
 yuvaraj ne bhi 30 se adhik ran banaaye
 Why not others if they are excluded
 ’unhone kaha, ‘chayan samiti ke pramukh sandip patil ko dressing room main jaakar un khilaadiyon se baat kerani chaiye jo kharaab shot par out hue
 Apart from this, bowlers should also be talked to
 yah dukh kii baat he ki khilaadi aise hansi majaak kar rahe hai or footbal khel rahe hai, maano kuch hua hi naa ho

 Hence, in the coming days, Delhi's government schools will outstrip private schools
 gauratlab he ki haal main bane dilli ke sarkari skulon kii building kii tarif deshbhar main hui thi
 Referring to which, Sisodia said that in the past, we have all seen how the government schools of the Delhi government are in no way inferior to the private schools
 jahaan swimming pool se lekar sisitivi or hitech classroom jaisi suvidhaayen di gai hai
 The government claimed to have mobilized 6000 buses for the odd-even formula being implemented from 1 January in Delhi
 iske liye sarkaar ne 26 disambar tak kaa samay diya tha par privet bas maalik is yojana par behad kam dilchaspee dikhaa rahe hai
 Alam is that there is less than 2 days left and not even 50 percent of the target has been worked
 6000 main se buudhvaar tak 905 praivet basen hi registerd huin
 Problems are coming up
 There are many problems behind doing this
 jaise- sabase badi samasya he ki pement tak apni jeb se paise lagane honge
 This formula is still for 15 days, in such a situation, no one wants to leave their old contract and apply for a bus for 15 days
 kai bason main peeche get bhi nahin he
 And do not want to give luxury buses to social transport
 abhi tak sarkaar ko jitani safalataa kii ummid thi utani safal ye yojana abhi tak nahin dikh rahi he
 Trial is to begin on 27th
 haalanki kuch bas union sarkaar kaa samarthan bhi karte hue bas maalikon se is yojana main judane ke liye apil bhi kar rahi he
 The government has associated many associations with itself
 nahin mil raheen skool busensarkaar ko is formule ko lagu karne ke liye skool bason kii bhi jarurat he lekin kai skool bas dene ko taiyaar nahi dikh rahe, vahiin praivet bas maalik bhi apni basen dene main dilchaspee nahi dikhaa rahe
 Lawyers and school affairs experts say that demanding buses from schools is a violation of many rules and regulations
 sardiyon kii chuttee ke dauraan kai schoolo main winter activities hoti he jiname skool bason kaa istemaal hota he
 The School Act states that school properties cannot be used as commercial activities
 bas skool kii sampatti he
 There is a clause in the insurance of buses that the bus should be used only for transporting school children, otherwise the Insurance Act will be violated
 schuli bason ke registration ke samay road tex main chhot milti he jabaki commercial baso kaa tex alag hota he
 That is, whatever the government has to do now, it has to be done in less than a week
 kyonki ek taarikh se ho saktaa he lakhon log bas or duusare parivahan se jane kii yojana bana rahe ho

 In Karnataka (karnataka) once again, the political political crisis has taken place
 karnataka main saat maah puraani mukhyamantri echdi kumaraswami nit congress-jad (es) gathbandhan (congress-jds Govt) sarkaar ko ek baar phir se asthir karne kii koshishen jari hai or iske centre main ek baar phir se bhartiya janata party hi he, jo isse pehle bhi kai baar aise prayaas doharaa chuki he
 In Karnataka, the Kumaraswamy government has come under fire after two independents withdrew support to the Janata Dal (S) -congress alliance
 haalanki, congress or jedies kaa kahana he ki unki sarkaar ko koi khatra nahin he or unki sarkaar sthir he
 He says that the bjp's attempt to destabilize the congress-jds government will not succeed
 saath hi donon partiyaan aarope laga rahi hai ki bhaajapa uske vidhayakon ko todane kii koshishon main juty he
 In fact, just before the Lok Sabha elections, once again the center of the Karnataka political debate became the point when three Congress mlas suddenly disappeared and then two independent mlas withdrew their support, shocking the Kumaraswamy government
 haalanki, baad main pataa chalaa ki congress ke ye teen vidhayak mumbai ke ek hotel main tehre hue hai
 In this way, 5 mlas are missing, which the congress-jds alleges is trying to buy them
 vahiin, yediurppa ke netritv main bhartiya janata party ne apane vidhayakon ko tod-phod se bachaane ke liye sabhi 104 vidhayakon ko gurugram ke ek resort main rakh diya he
 It is also being told that 4 mlas of Karnataka Congress, who stayed in a hotel in Mumbai, can resign today
 ye vidhayak yahaan pichley chaar dinon se tehre hue hai

 0 main koshish he ki kisi tarah ke 13 congressi vidhayakon ke istife dilaane kii taaki bahumat kaa aankada ghatakar 106 rah jaae or bijepi sarkaar bana le
 Operation Lotus 3 addresses this entire issue
 0 isliye kaha ja rahaa he kyonki yah teesri baar he jab bijepi satta main aane ke liye jod-tod kii raajnneeti kar rahi he
 Now BJP got resignation before these and by-elections were held
 bijepi ne in saaton ko apane tikat par siyaasi maidan main utaara or inamen se paanch vidhayak upachunaav main jeet hasil karne main kaamyaab rahe
 In this way, bjp's strength increased to 115 in the Assembly, two more than the majority

 India Today's anti-fake News War Room (AFWA) found that the tweet being viral is fake
 dhoni ne pichley kuch samay se koi twit nahin kiya he
 The Facebook page "MS DHONI FANS CLUB" posted this tweet which translates as: "I know the whole country is disappointed in our semi-final exit and i am being trolled for retirement, but leave it to my team This is not the right time to do it

 Dhoni's silence so far on retirement may also be one of the reasons why this post went viral

 film 'prem ratan dhan payo' kii box offis par jabardast kamai jari he
 The film has recorded around Rs 250 crore worldwide in 4 days of its release
 haal hi main salmaan khan ne is film se jude kai sawaalon ke jawaab die
 Here is an excerpt from this special conversation: What would you like to say about the character 'prem'? The credit for the name 'prem' goes to Sooraj Badzatya
 unhone kai saal pehle, jab 'prem' or 'praan' naam ke negative kirdaar hua karte the yani koi bhi abhibhavak apane bachche kaa naam praan yaa 'prem' nahin rakhana chahta tha, us dauraan logon kii soch ko badalane ke liye suraj ne hero kaa naam 'prem' rakhaa, jise logon ne pasand bhi kiya
 Just then the journey of 'love' started
 vaise bhi aadmi naam se nahin, apane kaam se pahachaanaa jaataa he
 The character of 'prem' is still alive in people's minds, that is, 'prem' has earned a name only because of his work
 'prem ratan dhan payo' kaa prem pehle relies hui filmon se kitna alag tha?vah bahut hi alag kirdaar he, sabko hansaata he, apni samskruti ke jariye sabko ek saath jodgaye main laga rahata he
 In this way, a kind of learning has been given in the film that what is the threshold of our culture, do not cross it
 
 
 yani prem ek aisa kairactor he, jo khud sochataa he ki jo vah kar rahaa he, uskaa prabhaav kaisaa rahegaa
 In this way he does not do anything wrong, just keeps trying to keep everyone together
 film main raajaaon kii family kii lav story he jisamen bhai-bahan kaa bhi ek alag angel dekhne ko milegaa
 You were not keeping coincidence with the title of the film? No no sir, we often say 'ram Ratan Dhan Payo'
 
 
 lekin ye tital kaaphi alag tha
 In the same round, it seemed a bit strange to take the name of the film in the initial phase
 phir dhire-dhire 'prem ratan dhan payo' se hi sab friendli ho gaye
 Nowadays people create short forms anyway
 ham ek film ke pramotion main gaye the to us dauraan mere ek fain ne poocha ki sar, 'empike (MPK)' kab relies ho rahi he
 When i was shocked, he said, i am talking about 'maine Pyar Kiya (MPK)'
 is par mujhe hansi aa gai
 That is, the new generation of today finds short-form of everything
 is film ke set kii bhavyata ke bare main kya kahenge?'maine pyaar kiya', 'ham aapke hai koun' 'ham saath saath hai' ityadi suraj kii sabhi filmon ke set kii bhavyata vaaki main dekhne laayak hoti he
 In this sense, i have become a Prince in this film and Sonam Kapoor Princess, the set must be grand
 is film ke sheesh mahal ko taiyaar karne ke liye rajasthan se karigar aae the, jo vaaki main vishalkay or bhavy tha
 The Sheesh Mahal has been demolished, but the palace was built at ND Studio in Mumbai
 suraj jab bhi meri life main aae, vah meri jindagi ko ek padaav upar hi lekar gaye hai
 Geeta, who has come to India from Pakistan, also wants to thank you and wants to meet you? First, the identification of her parents is complete
 mujhe acha lagata he ki jab real life main bhi aisa hota he
 First of all, i thank the Foundation of Pakistan and Ibkish Bibi, who supported Geeta
 iske alaava main kahana chaahunga ki gita pehle apane maa-baap ke paas pahunch jaae or ve bhi use utana hi pyaar karen ki itane varshon kii duuri ko gita bhula sake
 That is, till now, in Pakistan, as she has been raised for 14 years, in the same way her parents would like her as well as her own
 gita ko apano se itnaa prem milanaa chahie ki vah kabhi bhavishya main pakistan jane kii khwaahish bhi naa kare
 Your organization 'being Human' is also working to mix forgotten people? Yes, our NGO 'being Human' has also been campaigned to meet the separated people, under which Antara Desai was taken to his loved ones
 is
 abhi tak kareeb 30 bachche, apane parivaar se mil chuke hai or aage bhi hamaara enjio yah silsilaa jari rakhega
 At the same time, we are also engaged in planning to make proper arrangements for such children who are separated from parents
 aapke or aamir ke bich matbhed kii khabaren thi?wo aise hi afvaah thi isamen koi bhi sachai nahin he
 Can anyone have a feud with Aamir Khan? These are all misinformation
 kya aapako lagata he ki is film ke baad bhartiya samskruti par gaharaa prabhaav padegaa?vaaki main film dekhne ke baad log khud ko kuch samay ke liye acha insaan banaaenge
 Like when we go to temple, mosque, gurudwara, church or while reading and worshiping Namaz, we remain good before and after sometime and then after some time we become normal
 yani film se log khud ko conect karke dekhenge or use enjoy bhi karenge
 The purpose of our films is that people should learn from them
 joint family ke bare main kya kahana chahenge?mere hisaab se to joint family kaa matlab saath main rahanaa bhar hi nahin hota or aisi bhi family kaa kya matlab, jo rahete to saath main hai, lekin property aadi kii baton ko lekar aapas main hi jhagadate rahete hai
 Joint means hearts should be joint
 yani aap bhale hi alag rahen, lekin dukh-sukh main kisi ko aisa nahin feel hona chahie ki aap uske saath nahin hai
 According to me, the meaning of a joint family is to stand joint and help each other in problems
 'sultan' kii kya taiyaariyaan chal rahi hai?'sultan' ke liye abhi 8 kilo or badhanaa he, film main resler kaa kirdaar nibhaakar jeetna bhi he, or jeetne ke liye waisi body honi jaruri he
 i am currently 90 kg and will be around 96-97 kg
 film main 2 -3 luks main najar aaunga
 You were about to do a Marathi film based on education 'shikshacha Aichya Gho'? No, i am not able to do it, now the education system has also changed so i am not able to do a film
 pakistani actors ke hindi filmon main kaam karne ke virodh main aap kya kahana chahenge?aaj hamaari filmein pakistan main relies ho rahi hai or vahaan kii awam hamaare kaam ko pasand bhi kar rahi he
 Also, we are also getting a lot of income from Pakistan today
 is tarah se hamen aapasi jhagade main nahin padana chahie balki aapas main milakar aage tarakkee kii raah par agrasar rahanaa chahie
 Now, if we need a Pakistani character in the film, then he must be given a chance and try it on his creativity
 is lihaaj se cinema main bharat-pakistan ke liye koi bhi boundry nahin he, ham saath kaam karne main lage hai

 dilli mahila ayog main ek shikaayat mili jisamen jyoti giri naam ke ek swayambhu baba ke khilaaf gambhir aarope lagaae gaye hai
 According to the information, this Baba lives by building an ashram in the Mahakal temple in village Bahoda Kalan in Gurugram, Haryana

 In that video, he told that Baba was sexually abusing him for the last few days
 usne yah bhi aarope lagaaya he ki us baba ne pichley 20 saalon se ashram main rahane vaaleen kai anya mahilaon or ladakiyon kaa yon utpeedan kiya he
 The girl said that she is in danger of life from Baba and his associates
 shikayatakarta ne ayog ko bataaya ki is bare main police ko kai shikaayatein karne ke baavjood aaj tak is maamle main exiaar tak darj nahin kii gai he or na hi us baba ko abhi tak giraftaar kiya gaya he
 The complainant also alleged that Baba enjoys considerable political patronage and hence no officer is taking action against him
 bhaajapa or congress se jude haryana ke kai bade netaaon ke saath kathith baba kii tasviren soshal media par chal rahi hai
 The complainant told the commission that the Haryana Police has not registered an FIR against the said Baba, but by spreading the video of the ashram on social media, 2 firs have been filed against the people who took up the case
 dilli mahila ayog kii adhyaksha swati maliwal ne maamle kii gambhirtha ko dekhte hue isaki vistrut tareeke se jaanch kii maang kii
 He has appealed to the Chief Minister to immediately register an FIR against Baba and his people
 unka kahana he ki unako turant giraftaar kiya jaae
 At the same time, he requested that the unknown girl and other women and girls victim of Baba be immediately detected and immediately provided protection
 is maamle ko uthaane vaale logon ke khilaaf darj kii gai exiaar kii bhi sahi tareeke se jaanch kii jaae
 The chairman of the commission said, "people who resort to religion for their personal benefit and play with the feelings and lives of millions of people are a blot on society
" mujhe ummid he ki ukt baba kii gaiyrkanoonee gatividhiyon kii vistrut jaanch kii jaaegi or jald se jald uske upar exiaar darj karke usko giraftaar kiya jaayegaa
 ' bispi supremeo mayawati virdohi dalon ko apni siyaasi takat kaa ahsaas karaane ke liye 18 sitambar se apni reliyon kaa daur shuru kar rahi hai
 Mayawati's rallies are organized at the state's mandal level
 is kadi main 18 sitambar ko pehali raily meerut or saharanpur mandal kii sanyukt raily meerut main he
 These rallies are considered very important in view of the political future of BSP
 mayawati kii reliyonko safal banane vaale fund rager or bheed rager donon yaa partiyaan chhod chuke hai yaa phir mayawati ne unhen party se baahar kaa rasta dikhaa diya he
 In such a situation, the question arises as to how Mayawati's elephant will be filled with neither money nor partner
 iviem ke khilaaf bispi kaa pradarshan failbta den ki upi ke 2017 vidhansabha chunaav main mayawati ne karaari haar ke baad iviem ko kosa tha
 He had said that BSP workers would perform at district headquarters on the 11th of every month
 ye silsilaa tab tak jari rahegaa, jab tak iviem ke khilaaf koi thos kaarywahi nahin hoti
 Mayawati's decree failed completely
 bispi kaaryakarta iviem ke khilaaf jila mukhyalayon par nahin jute sake
 BSP supremo Mayawati, who did not gather on Ambedkar Jayanti, has been holding a huge rally on the occasion of Ambedkar Jayanti on 14 April every year
 is saal bhi mayawati ne lakhanu ke ambedkar maidan main 14 april ko ambedkar jayanti ke maukey par raily kaa aayojan kiya tha, lekin is raily main bispi bheed jutaney main kaamyaab nahin ho saki
 Only a few thousand people had gathered
 reliyon ke fail hone ke peeche ye vajahadrasal mayawati kii reliyon ko safal banane main party ke mahasachiv kii ahm bhoomika rahati thi
 In the last 6 months, many general secretaries have left the party and moved to other parties or Mayawati has thrown them out of the party
 aise main party main aise logon kii kami ho gai he, jo mayawati kii reliyon main bheed jutaney kaa kaam kiya karte the
 Among them, leaders like Swami Prasad Maurya, OBC face of BSP, Muslim leader, Nasimuddin Siddiqui, Indrajit Saroj among Dalits, RK Chaudhary are not in the party today
 aise main mayawati ke saamne bheed jutaney vaale netaaon kii poorti ke bina raily kaise safal hogi ye bada sawaal he
 BSP also facing shortage of fund razor: In the current times, BSP is also facing shortage of fund razor leaders
 mayawati kii reliyon ko safal banane main nasimuddin jaise kai netaa fund rager kaa kaam karte the, lekin pichley dinon mayawati ne unhen party se baahar kaa rasta dikhaa diya he
 In such a situation, how will the money spent for rallies be arranged? fund dene se kataraa rahe netabspi kii ek raily kaa kharch kareeb dhed se do karod rupee tak hota he, jo party netaa karte hai
 In the district or Lok Sabha where these rallies are to be held, the incharge of the place incurs all expenses
 loksabhaa or vidhansabha main bispi ko mili karaari haar ke baad party ke netaa paisa kharch karne se kataraa rahe hai
 In such a situation, there is an economic crisis on Mayawati's rallies at the Mandal level
 meerut or azamgarh ke baad kya hogasutron ke mutabik meerut kii raily kaa jimmaa jahaan yaqub kuraishi or kaaji raashid masood uthaa rahe hai, kyonki inke paas paise kii bharmaar he
 Mubarakpur MLA Jamali will bear the expenses for the rally to be held in Azamgarh and the Ansari brothers are responsible for the Banaras rally
 iske baad baaki reliyon kaa kharch uthaane ke liye koi netaa taiyaar nahin ho rahaa he
 Particular rallies of divisions like Gorakhpur, Bundelkhand, Bareilly, Faizabad, Allahabad are included

 pragna thakur ne kaha ki ek adhikari ne hemanth karkare se unhen chhodane kaa kaha tha lekin karkare ne kaha tha ki wo kuch bhi karenge, saboot laaenge lekin sadhvi ko nahin chodenge
 Sadhvi Pragya Thakur said that this step of Hemant Karkare was treason, anti-religious
 sadhvi boleen, ''ye uski kutilata thi ye deshadroh tha dharmaviruddh tha, wo mujhase poochta tha ki kya mujhe sach ke liye bhagwaan ke paas janaa hoga, to maine kaha tha ki aapako jarurat he to jaaie''
 In the meeting, the Sadhvi said, "I told her that you will have an apocalypse, she abused me
" jis din main gai to uske yahaan sutak laga tha or jab use aatankiyon ne maaraa to sutak khatm hua
 "let me tell you that Hemant Karkare was the victim of the bullets of terrorists in the terrorist attack in Mumbai
" iske alaava jis cese main sadhvi pragna aaropee thim, us maalegaanv serial blast kii jaanch inke paas hi thi
 However, a number of questions were raised on his charge sheet
 nai dilli : congress netaa hardik patel (hardik Patel) ko gujarat ke surendranagar main ek raily main bhaashan dete hue ek shaks ne thappad maar diya
 The video released by the news agency ANI shows that Hardik Patel is giving a speech on stage
 isi dauraan ek shaks chillaate hue manch par chadhataa he or hardik patel ko thappad jad detaa he
 After this there is a scuffle between the supporter and the person of Hardik Patel
 haalanki abhi shaks ke bare main or jaankaree nahin mil pai he, na hi yah pataa chal paaya he ki aakhir usne thappad kyon maaraa
 Let us tell you that a person had thrown a shoe during a press conference held at BJP headquarters in Delhi a day earlier
 jis vakt shaks ne juuta phenkaa tha, us dauraan bijepi netaa jiviel narsimha raav press conference ko sambodhit kar rahe the
 The shoe came out touching his face
 ghatana ke turant baad juuta phenkane vaale shaks ko pakad liya gaya tha
 Further investigation is on in the case
 ghatana kii soochna police ko de di gai
 After this, the police of the IP State police station reached the spot, detained the accused and took them to the police station
 juuta maarane vaala shaks khud kaa naam shakti bhargav bataa rahaa tha or vah kanpur kaa rahane vaala he
 Bhargava's family also has a hospital called Bhargava Hospital

 The family has evicted it
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki kisi plot ke maamle ko lekar vah pareshaan chal rahaa he
 Mental condition is not good
 nai dilli : pradhanmantri narendra modi ke helicopter kii kathith rup se jaanch karne vaale adhikari ke nilamban kaa maamla badhata dikhaai de rahaa he
 Now former Chief Election Commissioner Dr
 esavai kuraishi ne is maamle main bada bayaan diya he
 He said, 'the suspension of the officer investigating PM Modi's helicopter is unfortunate, as well as the PM and the Election Commission missed an opportunity to improve their image'
 kuraishi ne aage kaha, 'in donon sansthaaon kii janata ke prati javabdehi he, lekin pradhanmantri modi lagaataar chunaav aachaar samhita kaa ulanghan kar rahe hai or chunaav ayog ise baar-baar najar andaaj kar rahaa he
 The investigation of pm's helicopter should have been taken in such a way that the law is equal for all, but it did not happen '
 purv mukhya chunaav ayukta dow
 SY Quraishi further referred to the search of Odisha CM Naveen Patnaik's helicopter and said, 'the patience and gentleness he showed is worthwhile
 har netaa ko vaisaa hi vyavhaar karnaa chahie'
 On the other hand, BSP supremo Mayawati also gave Dr
 esavai kuraishi kii baton ke samarthan main twit kar chunaav ayog ko nishane par liya
 Questioning the commission, Mayawati said, "what authority does the Election Commission have which prevents the search of pm's aircraft and IAS supervisor is suspended for doing so
" bispi purv siisi kuraishi kii baton se sahamat he ki aisi karrwai anuchit he
 The Commission should do a fair work and not PM Modi get all kinds of open leeway '
 nai dilli: uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ne shuukravaar ko apane aadhikarik twitor acount par do twit kiya
 In this, he has clearly stated that the philosophy of my adorable Ramlala, Bajrang Bali and Mahadev ji should not be associated with any kind of politics
 main spasht karnaa chahta hum ki aasthaa kaa adhikaar samvidhan pradutt he or mujhe is adhikaar kaa prayog karne se koi roak nahin saktaa
 CM Yogi did this before addressing an election rally in Sambhal, UP on Friday
 isse pehle yogi adityanath par vivaadit bayaan kii vajah se chunaav ayog 72 ghante par chunavi sabha va road sho par roak lagaaya tha
 After which he held his first election rally in Sambhal on Friday
 siem yogi ne twit kar likhaa, ''mere rag rag main ram, kan kan main krishna, prayek shira main shiv or prayek dhamni main dharm va kartavya bodh nirantar pravaahit hota rahata he
 Today i would like to say again that my religious identity is Hindu, that Hindu who has been respecting all the religions and religions living in India since the same time
 '' bataa den, saal 2014 ke chunaav main bijepi uttar pradesh main record maton se jeet hasil karte hue 73 siton par kaabiz hui thi
 This time too, the claim is not 73 but 74 seats
 lekin seat daavon se nahin, samikarnon se milti he or is dafe sapa-basapa ke gathbandhan ne bijepi ke is sameekaran ko gadabada diya hai
 This is the reason why CM Yogi Adityanath has now started breaking the dalit-yadav i

 'DY' formula
 mahagathbandhan tod nitish kumaar ne bijepi se haath kya milaayaa, apane hi begaane ho gaye
 Nitish's association with the BJP went against Sharad Yadav, and he has taken a different path by dropping the slogan of rebellion
 aise main sharad yadav ek aisa siyaasi formula banane kii kavayad kar rahe hai, jiske jariye wo nitish kumaar or narendra modi donon se do-do haath kar saken
 Actually, Sharad Yadav has started his political journey with JP movement and he has always been fighting the fight for social justice
 itnaa hi nahin dalit, obisi or alpsankhyak hit kii baat bhi uthaate rahe hai
 In such a situation, Sharad wants to keep his political model around it
 vikalp ke rup main unke paas teen raajnneetik model hai
 It remains to be seen whether they choose any of these models, or offer a new model based on them
 pehla formula jepi modeljapi ke vichaaron se prabhavit hokar sharad yadav ne raajnneeti main kadam rakhaa or pehla chunaav 1974 main haldhar kisaan ke chunaav nishaan par jeet darj kii
 After this, the movement of VJP was fully colored and stood against the emergency and went to jail
 jepi andolan puri tarah se congress kii nitiyon ke khilaaf khadaa hua tha
 Today, there is no Congress in power, instead the BJP government headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 aise main sharad ke paas viklya he ki ve jepi model kii tarj par modi or nitish kii nitiyon ke khilaaf bijepi virodhiyon ko ekajute karke apni siyaasi raah banaaen
 The second formula is of VP Singh in front of VP Model Sharad
 pradhanmantri rahete hue veepi singh ne mandal ayog kii siforeeshon ko lagu karke desh main obisi aarakshan kaa rasta kholaa tha
 Sharad has seen and lived this model very closely
 yahi vajah he ki sharad veepi singh ke model ko phir se apanaakar obisi samaaj ko modi or nitish ke khilaaf ekajute kar sakate hai
 Third Kanshiram Model Sharad Yadav has the third political formula Kanshiram Model
 kanshiram ne dalit, obisi or alpsankhyakon ke bich raajnneetik chetana jagaane ke liye lambey samay tak sangharsh or andolan kiya tha or baad main unhone bispi bhi banaai
 Whose command is currently in Mayawati's hands
 kanshiram model se upi, bihar maharashtra sahit kai rajyon main daliton kaa raajnneetik pratinidhitiv badha
 In such a situation, Sharad Kanshi Ram can also adopt the model and move forward on the political path
 kanshiram ke is model ko ambedkar model bhi kaha ja saktaa he
 Fourth coordination model In addition to these three above political models in front of the shard, there is a fourth model coordination formula
 jepi model, veepi singh model or kanshiram model ko milakar samanvay model banane kii disha main wo aage bad sakate hai
 Sharad Yadav has called a meeting of non-bjp parties on Thursday, in which leaders of many parties, including leftist parties, socialists and RJD will be united
 ali anwar kehete hai ki gaiyr bijepi dalon ko ekajute karke ek aisa model sharad yadav bananaa chaahate hai jiske jariye desh kii sajhi viraasat or desh kii loktantric vyavastha ko bachaane ke liye aage badha jaae
 In which we have models from Ambedkar to JP and VP Singh, which can be combined to form a coordination model, representing all classes
 har insaan kii khwaahish hoti he ki uski shaadi dhoomdhaam se ho
 Life partner is favorite
 lekin jab kundali ke grahon main dosha hota he
 So marriage is not only formed, but the relationship is broken by getting married
 vahiin kuch logon kii to shaadi ho jaati he lekin shaadishuda jindagi main dushwariyaan kam nahin hoti
 Know which planets are the cause of this problem and what are the ways to avoid them
 shani kaa shaadi-vivaah par asar- vaivaahik jivan ke tuutane main sabase badi bhoomika shani nibhaataa he- agar shani kaa sambandh vivaah bhav yaa iske grah se ho to vivaah bhang hota hi he- shani agar vivaah bhang karne kaa kaaran ho to iske peeche ghar ke log jimmedaar maane jate hai- jab sambandh tuutata he to use sudharne main bahut samay bhi lag jaataa he- agar shani kii vajah se vaivaahik jivan main samasya aa rahi ho to shiv ji ko roj jal chadhayen- har shanivaar ko lohe ke bartan main bharkar sarson ke tel kaa daan karenaisa nahin he ki shaadi main aane vaali samasyaon ke liye sirf shani hi jimmedaar he
 If there is a defect in other planets, then marriage becomes a hindrance in marriage
 jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki agar kundali ke mangal main dosha ho to shaadishuda jindagi bhi nark ban jaati he
 Use the roots of plants as gems, you will get the benefits of benefic Mangal on marriage - Marital life is about to break the relationship - If the matter has reached violence then Mars is behind it - Mars gives problems in marital life If the case reaches the beating - marital relationship is dissolved very soon after marriage - the matter reaches court court also immediately - if the problem is caused by Mars Or if you are coming, keep a fast on Tuesday - Donate sweet things to the poor every Tuesday - Use red color to a minimum
 If the position of Jupiter is weak in your horoscope, then it is possible that there will be obstacles in your marriage and if you get married If left too weak Jupiter can cause problems in his later life
 lekin agar brihaspati majboot ho to khushiyon kii saugat detaa he
 What is the original constellation, how does it affect you? Jupiter's effect on marriage - if Jupiter is good in the horoscope then it eliminates the obstacles of marriage - if the lord of the seventh house is in sight, then the barrier of marriage ends - Jupiter sitting in the Ascendant is the most powerful - such Jupiter destroys all obstacles - if Jupiter is in the seventh house, sometimes the person also remains unmarried
 Interpretation is that Jupiter friendly are you a never donated yellow things that Jupiter Donate banana worsen, Best would- if marriage due to Jupiter using these policy donated lore so i can not be infallible
 ye upasna aapaki vivaah sambandhi har pareshaani kaa rambaan upaay he
 You should read the news published on BSNL and MTNL in the last few months to understand what happens to the reader and any institution through news
 kis tarah donon sansthaanon ke karmchaaree jhaanse main aate hai
 The government could have said directly that we are shutting down these two companies, but due to the elections, dreams started coming through the proposals
 saath main kek par pulavama hamale kaa jawaab bhi top ap ke rup main tha
 So the happiness of these two companies erupted
 baaki saarvajanik kshetra kii companiyon ko laga ki unke saath bhi kuch nahin hoga
 The business standard of 11 April 2019 reports that the telecom ministry has proposed to provide 4G spectrum to BSNL
 ummid paidaa ho gai
 What happened? In an interview to the Economic Times on 5 September 2019, the chairman of BSNL says that after talking to all levels of government, it seems that they understand the concerns of BSNL
 chairman 4ji ko lekar puche gaye sawaal kaa jawaab dete hai
 April to September arrived and the government is still thinking about the concerns
 zaahir he april main chunaav tha
 BSNL employs 1 lakh 65 thousand employees
 agast kii selary let se ai
 Now 70 to 80 thousand of these will be retired
 chairman ne intervyuu main kaha he ki ab kaam outsorcing or kantrect se honge
 This is also an expected statement
 kaam hi nahin hoga to outsource kya hoga
 In July 2019, several newspapers including the Times of India reported that the government would bring a package of 74,000 crore to save BSNL and MTNL
 5 sitambar 2019 ko iconomics times main beasenal ke chairman kaa intervyuu chhapata he
 They say that revenue is being collected by paying land on rent or lease
 beasenal ke toweron ko kiraaye par dene kii yojana he
 In the last week of September, news appeared in several newspapers including Financial Express that the Finance Ministry has rejected the proposal of a package of 74000 crores to save BSNL and MTNL
 inamen se 30-40 hazaar karod riatarment par karch hone vaale the or baaki se 4ji aata
 4G has not been given yet
 ab to bazaar main 5ji aane vaala he
 Obviously, BSNL and MTNL will be kept in the air and will be closed one day
 tab in sansthaanon ke paune do lakh karmchaaree godi media par pakistan ko lekar dibet dekh sakate hai
 From there we can raise expectations that something is happening
 sawaal simpal he
 Why the government which is selling other companies to raise 1 lakh crores, will give a package of 74,000 crores to save BSNL and MTNL? Which private companies did not benefit from arguing on which private companies benefited from not giving 4G to BSNL
 jab bahes karne kaa vakt tha, iske karmchaaree kuch or kar rahe the
 Public sector employees like BPCL, SCI, CONCOR, NEEPCO, THDC must have seen the rally in Houston and felt that India's name would be happening
 unhone yah khabar hi nahin padhi hogi ki modi or trump ke bich jo baatcheet hui he uskaa nateeja kya rahaa
 In the same way they have no idea what their future will be
 saarvajanik kshetra kii companiyon main kaam karne ke halaat behatar the, isliye log privet naukari chhod kar yahaan kaam karne aate the
 Now doors will be opened with new names to drive them away from here, which will sometimes be called VRS or sometimes a package or sometimes a plan
 aaj ke akhabaaron main khabar he ki sarkaar apana vittiya ghaataa puraa karne ke liye paanch companiyon main apni hissedari bech kar 60,000 karod jutaney ja rahi he
 BPCL, SCI, CONCOR, NEEPCO, THDC stake will be sold
 sarkaar ko vinievesh ke zarie ek lakh karod chahie
 Business Standard writes that the government may not sell all five companies in private hands
 wo saarvajanik kshetra kii companiyon ke haathon bhi bech sakati he
 This will mean that there will be no charge of selling and employees will be moved
 phir agle charan main privet companiyon ko bhi bechaa ja saktaa he
 Who has stopped sarkaar kaa khazaana khaali he
 This fiscal year the target was 17 in tax collection
 4 pratishat kii vruddhi hogi
 But only 5-6 percent is happening
 jiesti se bhi shandaar vasuuli nahin ho rahi he
 So what will happen now? nothing will happen
 sarkaar jo karnaa chaahegi use koi nahin roak sakegaa
 Public sector workers will go to the media
 media cover nahin karegaa
 While he himself has been a subscriber of the dock media for so long, on which the voice of the people does not come
 to ab us media se ummid karnaa khud ko dhokhaa dena hoga jaise wo khud ko hindu muslim dibet dekhte hue dhokhaa de rahe the
 The opposition that was spitting on will abuse the opposition that the opposition is also silent
 jab wo bolta he to hansane kaa yaa thukne kaa koi mauka nahin chhodte hai
 They will not dare to take out the procession
 nikaalenge bhi to do teen dinon main thak jaaenge
 Labor unions also know
 isliye janvari 2020 main hadtaal kii baat kar rahe hai
 By then the government would have done all the disinvestment
 in khabaron ko pard kar chintaa na karen
 Recall the golden moments of the Hindu Muslim Debate and stay relaxed
 ab kaaphi der ho chuki he
 The best thing would be to welcome these decisions of the government
 tanaav kam hoga
 They should not compromise their self-respect
 na to kisi media ke paas janaa chahie or na hi kisi vipaksh ko yaad karnaa chahie
 Be silent like everyone is silent in the case of Chinmayananda
 pragna thakur par chup hai
 Are silent on the statements justifying Gandhi's assassination

 The meeting of the Public Accounts Committee was adjourned as differences continued

 Sources said that the BJP and other opposition parties insisted that Singh should be summoned as the figure of loss in the 2G case is different from the figures reported by the government

 In the absence of consensus, PAC Chairman Murali Manohar Joshi adjourned the meeting on the ground that the legal and constitutional aspects raised by the members today will be considered and will be discussed in the next meeting

 haryana cader ke varisht IAS adhikari ashok khemka (ashok Khemka) kaa 53veen baar tabadalaa kar diya gaya he
 Haryana government has appointed 1991-batch senior bureaucrat Ashok Khemka this time as Principal Secretary of the Archives, Archeology and Museum Departments
 is sandarbh main ashok khemka se enditivi ke raveesh kumaar ne baat kii
 Khemka said, 'every transfer goes by teaching something
 koi bhi tabadalaa bagaiyr vajah ke nahin hota, uske peeche koi na koi vajah hoti he
 If you remember the talk of October 2012, in some transfers you are marginalized
 shaayad ye usee cheez kaa parichaayak he ki aapako haashiye main rakhkar dandit kiya gaya he
 "ajay Khemka said that" Every transfer is taught by some and for some reason
 kuch tabadale hote hai ki aapako haashiye main rakh diya jaataa he
 Something you do such that you are marginalized to punish
 yah usee cheez kaa parichaayak he ki aapako haashiye main rakhkar dandit kiya gaya he
 "he said that" There is a law in the process of transfer, you cannot separate from that
 or supreme court ke diarection hai
 The law of IAS cadre rules is that whatever you transfer will be with the recommendation of the Civil Services Board
 doosraa niyam he ki aapako do saal kaa minimum tenyor diya jayega
 The Supreme Court reiterated these two things again in 2013
 court ne kaha tha ki teen saal kaa minimum tenyor hoga
 "ashok Khemka said that" all the rules are the rules, but little transparency was used in the transfer
 
 According to the officer's aptitude, if the posting is done then the people are benefited
 kisi machhlee ko ped par chadhaakar kaha jaae ki tum udo, to thik nahin
 And if someone has not fulfilled the personal interests of someone, then if he is transferred then that is also not right
 ''haryana cader ke iees adhikari ashok khemka (ashok Khemka) kaa isse pehle isi saal march main khemka transfar karte hue unhen vigyaan or praudyogiki vibhaag kaa pradhan sachiv niyukt kiya gaya tha
 Ashok Khemka was relieved of the transfer for the 53rd time in his 27-year career
 buudhvaar ko unhone twit kar kaha, ''phir tabadalaa
 Returning there again
 kal samvidhan diwas manaaya gaya
 Today the Supreme Court order and rules were broken once more
 kuch prasann honge
 The final destination which was felt was the reward of honesty
 ''gauratlab he ki ashok khemka (ashok Khemka) gurugram main sonia gandhi ke damaad robert wadra kii jameen saude se judi jaanch ke kaaran surkhiyon main rahe hai
 Ashok Khemka is said to have exposed scams and scams in whatever department he goes to, due to which he often has to bear the brunt of transfer
 vah bhupinder singh hooda ke shasankaal main bhi kai ghotaalon kaa khulaasa kar chuke hai
 Ashok Khemka was born in Kolkata, West Bengal
 unhone iaiti khadgpur se 1988 main beatech kiya or baad main computer science main piechdi kiya
 He also has an MBA
 bataa den ki november 2014 main tatkaaleen hooda sarkaar ne robert wadra or dlef ke land deal se jude khulaase ke baad khemka kaa tabadalaa parivahan vibhaag main kar diya tha, jisko lekar kaaphi ho-hallaa machaa tha or sarkaar ke is faisle par sawaal uthe the

 The ruling Janata Dal United (JD-U) retained its Darundha assembly seat in the by-election held recently
 yah upachunaav jad-you kii vidhayak jagamaato devi kii maut ke kaaran karwaanaa padaa tha
 JD-U fielded novice Kavita Singh, the newly married wife of Ajay Singh, the infamous son of the late MLA
 haalanki jad-you kii ummidavaar kaa jeet kaa antar november 2010 main hue vidhansabha chunaav ke 31,135 se ghatakar is baar sirf 20,092 maton kaa rah gaya, lekin nitish kii team phir bhi sahi sabit hui, kyonki party ummidavaar ko 51,754 mat mili, jo unki divangat saas jagamaato ko mili maton se zyada hai
 26 October 2011: See in pictures India Today The outcome of the bye-election is being seen once again as a confirmation of Nitish Kumar's growing dominance in Bihar, while the Congress has become a secondary player in this state which has 40 members in the Lok Sabha
 yah upachunaav ek baar phir nitish or lalu kii takkar banakar ubhara, jisamen phir ek baar jeet bihar ke mukhyamantri ke hi haath lagi he
 It is believed that Anna Factor had no role in this result
 apane ummidavaar parameshwar singh ko mili 31,662 maton ke saath rashtriya janata dal duusare sthaan par rahaa or usne datakar muqabla kiya
 Lalu's team can take satisfaction in the fact that it has not only managed to increase its share of votes this time as compared to 17,980 votes received in 2010, but it has also been able to reduce the margin of victory on that seat, Which has been in the account of Jagmato's family for the last four elections
 jahaan jad-you or rajd, donon apane praapt maton main vruddhi karne main kaamyaab rahe hai, congress sabase badi phiseddi ke taur par ubhari he
 Apart from forfeiting his bail, Congress nominee Kalika Sharan Singh was able to garner just 4,238 votes, which is almost half of the 8,399 votes Congress got in the 2010 assembly elections

 The recurring defeat of the Congress seems to be more serious as the party held the Raghunathpur seat till the 2005 elections and the Darundha seat was cut from Raghunathpur, which ended in the 2009 delimitation process
 haalanki uske baad se congress kaa pradarshan bihar main congress kii ruuthati kismat kaa hi ek laghu rup najar aata he
 In the 2010 assembly elections, Congress candidate Vijay Shankar Dubey received 8,399 votes
 is baar congress ne ek nae ummidavaar ko is ummid se utaara tha ki vah uski kismat phir jagaa degaa, lekin aisa ho na sakaa
 Although the outcome of the by-election hardly made any difference to the functioning of the NDA government, apart from a pleasant feeling for Nitish's team, it certainly raised alarm bells for Lalu Prasad as the RJD candidate's second consecutive defeat in that district
 The district, which is itself adjacent to the parliamentary constituency of Lalu
 daraundha upachunaav main party ummidavaar parameshwar singh kii madad ke liye lalu prasad do puraane pratidwandviyon-shahabuddin or prabhunath singh ko ek saath le aae the, lekin yah bhi bematlab sabit hua
 Not Anna, the results of the Nitish Factor Daraundha by-election are being seen as a reaffirmation of the growing stature of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar in Bihar
 november, 2010main hue vidhansabha chunaav main congress ko yahaan mili 8,399 vot is baar or bhi ghatakar mahaj 4,238 kii sankhya par aa gaye
 Both Rashtriya Janata Dal and JD-U increased their votes compared to the November 2010 votes
 congress ne ek nae ummidavaar kalika sharan singh ko maidan main utaara tha, lekin ve bhi apni jamaanat jabt kara baithe
 The performance of the Congress here looks like a smaller version of the crumbling fort of the Congress in Bihar
