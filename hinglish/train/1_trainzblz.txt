 kiran bedi : kiran bedi kaa naam kisi pahchaan kaa mohataaj nahin he
 Former IPS officer and philanthropist Kiran Bedi is active in public life
 baad main ve anna andolan se bhi judi raheen
 Kiran Bedi, who is considered very fearless and fearless even during her career, has been very famous for her forced nature
 
 
 
 And the image of this Iron Lady, BJP is trying to cash in on it
 bijepi ne kiran bedi ko sabhi puraane netaaon ko darkinar kar mukhyamantri ke pad ke liye niyukt kiya he, lekin bedi ke sir par khud kii seat jeetne ke alaava unhen dilli kii janata ke bich khud ko kejariwal kaa vikalp ke rup main bhi sthapit karne kii dohari zimmedaari he

 arvind kejariwal: purv iares officer, artiai kaaryakarta or india against karpshan abhiyaan ke sangyojanak arvind kejariwal dilli ke mukhyamantri bhi rah chuke hai
 Arvind Kejriwal's identity is clear from the fact that the BJP had to field Kiran Bedi, his own ally of his party, against him
 kejariwal pichhali baar dilli kii satta se istifa dekar ek badi rajnatik galati kar chuke hai, unpar dilli kii janata kaa vishwaas dobaaraa jeetne kaa daaromadar he
 If they are not able to do so, then perhaps they may have to start from scratch again

 manish sisodiya : patpadganj se aam aadmi party ke ummidavaar manish sisodiya kii aam aadmi party main kaaphi mahatvapurn jagah he
 He is considered the number two leader in the party after Kejriwal and is also close to Kejriwal
 manish sisodiya un chand logon main se he jinhone pehle din se aam aadmi party kaa saath diya he or puri majbooti ke saath
 However, in this election, Manish Sisodia is going to face the challenge of former colleague Vinod Kumar Binny, whose base is also considered good
 ye muqaabala sisodiya ke liye aasaan nahin hoga

 BJP is yet to announce its candidate from this seat

 Ajay Maken: The Congress has given the responsibility of Delhi elections this time to its young and loyal face Ajay Maken

 co / dbozfekle9— Narendra Modi (@narendramodi)april 23, 2017 The rally of Samajwadi Party (SP), Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) coalition was held at Champa Devi Park in Gorakhpur on May 13 before the last phase of Lok Sabha elections
 pehle chah charan ke chunaav main gathbandhan ko mili chunauti kaa abhas shaayad basapa rashtriya adhyaksh mayawati ko ho chukaa tha
 Mayawati said, "if the people of the alliance transfer each other's votes, then Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be discharged
" ’’ vot transfar ko lekar mayawati kii ashanka nirmul sabit nahin hui
 On the day of the results, on May 23, it became clear that the entire vote of the alliance's constituents was not transferred to each other
 gathbandhan 39 pratishat se kuch adhik vot hi hasil kar sakaa, jo 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav or 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main sapa, basapa or ralod gathbandhan ke kul maton se bhi kaaphi kam tha (dekhen graphics)
 The effect of not transferring votes was clearly visible in the Lok Sabha seats in the SP stronghold
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main mainpuri se pratyaashee or sapa sangrakshak mulaayam singh yadav ne 55 fisadi vot lekar bhaajapa pratyaashee ko saadhe teen lakh se adhik maton se haraaya tha
 1 to the BSP candidate in that election
 42 lakh vot mili the
 This time, on April 19, Mayawati and Mulayam Singh Yadav shared the stage at an alliance rally in Mainpuri on 24 April to unite the sp-bsp's conflicting votes in the elections
 baavjood iske sapa or basapa ke paramparaagat yadav or dalit (vishesh kar jatav) votaron main hichak barkaraar rahi
 Mulayam received 70,000 votes less than the 2014 Lok Sabha election
 pichhali baar saadhe teen lakh maton se jeetne vaale mulaayam is chunaav main bamushkil 94 hajaar maton se hi jeet paae
 Dimple Yadav, wife of SP national president Akhilesh Yadav and former Kannauj MP from Kannauj, Lok Sabha seat of Yadav belt was in the fray
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bhaajapa ummivaar subrat pathak se dimple keval 20 hajaar maton se jeet pai thim
 However the BSP got 1 in the 2014 election
 27 lakh mat mili the
 This time, Dimple gave a message of solidarity to the supporters of the SP-BSP by touching the feet of Mayawati on the stage at the April 25 public meeting in Kannauj
 dimple kaa yah prayaas rang nahin laayaa
 Dimple only managed to get 60 thousand more votes
 bhaajapa ummivaar ne pichhali baar se 94 hajaar vot badhaakar dimple ko 12 hajaar se haraa diya, jabaki aath hajaar se adhik vot nota ko mili
 Brijesh Kumar Yadav, Principal of Bhogaon Inter College, Mainpuri, says, "apart from the Muslim vote, the traditional vote of the SP-BSP alliance was not the same proportion as the other parties had to get
 yahi gathbandhan ke haar kii pramukh vajah rahi
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the alliance's constituents made a total of 42
 66 pratishat batore the or is tarah vah pradesh kii 42 siton par aage tha
 The alliance was ahead in 57 Lok Sabha seats with the vote share (see box) in the 2017 assembly elections
 inhen majboot aankadon se 2019 main gathbandhan ko bhaajapa se kahin zyada majboot aanka ja rahaa tha
 But the alliance was reduced to only 15 seats, in which the BSP got 10, the SP got only 5 seats while the rld's account was not opened
 lakhanu main dow
 Sushil Kumar, Associate Professor of Political Science at Bhimrao Ambedkar University, says, "in the 2014 and 2017 elections, candidates from different constituencies of the alliance had received votes of their caste apart from traditional votes
 2019 main jab gathbandhan kaa ek hi ummidavaar tha to use paramparaagat maton ke saath pichley chunaavon main mili alag-alag jatiyon ke vot is baar nahin mili
 This led to a decline of at least three percent of the total vote of the coalition despite the three parties meeting
 ’’sapa-basapa or ralod gathbandhan astitv main aane ke saath hi kai sari chunautiyon ko lekar prakat hua tha (dekhen box)
 a challenge was indicated by Mulayam Singh Yadav in the SP State Office on 21 February
 sapa-basapa gathbandhan ke saamne sabase badi chunauti apane un netaaon ko saath rakhane kii thi jo pichley paanch varshon se loksabhaa chunaav kii taiyaari kar rahe the
 In more than half of the Lok Sabha seats of the state, the leaders of SP and BSP, angry with the alliance, joined other parties
 mulaayam singh yadav ke kareebi rahe kanpur ke sapa netaa rajesh sachaan, puvavarti sapa sarkaar main mantri or basti ke varisht netaa rajakishor singh jaise netaa congress kaa daaman thamkar chunaav main khadey ho gaye
 BSP leader Ramesh Bind joined the BJP and contested from Bhadohi and won
 biechayu main professor ajit kumaar kehete hai, ''badi sankhya main sapa-basapa netaaon ke duusare dalon main shaamil hone se gathbandhan ko alag-alag jatiyon main janaadhar badhaane kaa mauka hi nahin mila
 The coalition was mainly dependent on the Muslim, Yadav and Jatav (dalit) castes
 jansankhya main in jatiyon kii hissedari 40 pratishat ke kareeb he
 At the same time, the BJP managed to mobilize other castes
 ’’ sapa ke mukhya pravaktaa rajendra choudhary gathbandhan main asantosh ko sire se khaarij karte hai
 He says, "the alliance was formed on social grounds, not caste
" bhaajapa ne satta kaa durupyog karke samaaj ke nichle tabake ke logon ko tarah-tarah ke sabjbag dikhaakar unka mat hathiyaa liya

 donon dalon ke bich vot transfar nahin hue
 He said that SP President Yadav could not convince the voters, that is why his wife and brother also lost the election themselves

 In such a situation, India demands that its requirements should be met in this rule

 america kii chahat he ki bharat iran se tel naa kharide
 If you buy, America can ban India
 - bharat apane dost rus se S-400 missile system khareednaa chahta he
 But America wants India not to buy these weapons from Russia and buy it from America itself
 - trade war ke bich america kii maang he ki bharat uske product par tex kii daron main chhot de
 So that American companies do not face any problem
 - america ye bhi chahta he ki bharat main unke desh kii soshal media / internet se judi companiyon ko license lenaa padataa he, is maang ko dur kiya jaae

 (bhashaa input ke saath ajtak antertenment desk) Is it now impossible to distribute the Padma awards without any controversy
 har saal puraskaar se pehle vivaad, sifarish, chatukaarita kii khabaren aa jaati hai
 The awards are to be given on the evening of 26 January, but the commotion starts from December
 taaja maamla sina nehwal kaa he
 The Padma Awards were instituted in 1954
 vichaar yah tha ki alag-alag kshetron main desh kaa naam asaadhaaran rup se ooncha karne vaale logon ko sammanit kiya jaae
 But the lobbying started to get or be given away and the arbitrariness of these awards faded
 itani ki do saal pehle mashhoor plabac singer es
 Janaki refused to take it
 74 varshiya janaki ko chaar rashtriya puraskaar mil chuke hai
 After this age and so many honors, he was not considered a Padma Bhushan
 janaki kaa yah aakrosh darasal puure dakshin bhartiya rajyon kii bhaavana se miltaa-julata tha
 Last year, 20 people from Delhi were awarded the Padma Awards
 jabaki dakshin ke chaaron rajyon ko kul milakar 21 padam puraskaar die gaye
 So, are the Padma awards given for serving governments rather than serving the country? The Manmohan Singh government gave the Padma award to the controversial hotelier Sant Singh Chatwal
 yah inam unki bharat-america ke bich parmaanu samjhaute main bhoomika ke liye tha
 The same Chatwal has been sentenced to five years in a US court on charges of cheating
 atal bihari vaajapeyi ke ghutane kaa oparation karne vaale dow
 Chittaranjan Singh Ranaut also got Padma Bhushan
 2010 main to saf ali khan ko bhi padam puraskaar de diya gaya
 However, the government was later told that he was facing a case of quarreling in the hotel
 lekin upie sarkaar ke is faisle ke khilaaf to endie sarkaar ne bhi koi doosraa faisla nahin liya he
 It is not that there is no guideline for awarding these awards
 In 1996, a high-level committee headed by then Vice President KR Narayanan set the eligibility criteria for these awards
 usamen puraskaar paane vaale ke yogadan ko lekar kade niyam banaae gaye
 But how it was followed can be gauged from the fact that in 2004, the then President APJ Abdul Kalam had to write a letter to the then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee to be careful in selecting the candidates for these awards
 iske baad ai do upie sarkaron ne bhi niyamon kaa jamkar ulanghan kiya
 Deadlines set for award entries vary
 sellection cameti main manamaane dhang se pherbadal kiye gaye
 Now that Saina Nehwal has questioned the selection of the Padma awards, no one has objected that wrestler Sushil Kumar should not get this award
 lekin itnaa to tay ho hi gaya he ki kahin na kahin dabaav ke raste in puraskaron tak kaa safar aasaan ho jaataa he

 Despite the stern attitude of the central government, the situation on the border is not normal
 padosi desh china ne ek baar phir bhartiya sarhad langhi he
 It is being told that Chinese soldiers entered the Indian border and uprooted tents of shepherds in Demchok village of Leh
 antarrashtriya seemaa ke paas shuukravaar or shanivaar kii darmyaani raat yah ghatana hui
 The Leh MP has confirmed the incursion from China
 beete shuukravaar ko hi raksha mantri arun jetali ne sansad main bataaya tha ki arunachal par apana stand china ke saamne sakht lahaze main rakhaa ja chukaa hajetali ne bataaya tha ki bharat ne china se saaf-saaf kah diya he ki arunachal pradesh or jammu-kashmir bharat kaa abhinn hissaa hai
 Arun Jaitley said in the Lok Sabha that China is claiming about 90,000 square kilometers in Arunachal Pradesh
 unhone kaha, 'jammu-kashmir main china ne lagbhag 38,000 varg kilometre kabja kar rakhaa he
 'apart from this, Pakistan has illegally given 5,180 sq km area of kashmir to China
 unhone kaha, 'tathy he ki arunachal pradesh or jammu-kashmir bharat ke abhinn va avibhajya ang hai
 This truth has been conveyed clearly to China on several occasions
 'isse pehle china ne ek nayaa nakshaa jari karke vivaad paidaa karne kii koshish kii thi
 In this map, China has shown parts of Kashmir and Arunachal Pradesh as part of its country
 kisi samay vishvabhar main vikhyath rahe jawaharlal nehru vishvavidhyalay (jeenyu) ko vishwa hindu parishad (viechpi) ne vishadhariyon kaa adda bataaya he
 The Delhi unit of the organization complains that in this central university campus, Mother Durga is sometimes insulted, sometimes the Asuras are glorified, sometimes there is a party of cow meat and sometimes pig meat
 viechpi ne vishvavidhyalay prashasan se is masale par turant karrwai karne kii apil kii he
 VHP (delhi) General Secretary Ramakrishna Shrivastava said that in JNU, Kashmiri separatists are sometimes honored, sometimes Naxalites are insulted, sometimes the tricolor is insulted, sometimes the national emblem Ashoka is trampled under shoes
 viechpi (dilli) ke jhandevalaan karyaalay main hui mahatvapurn baithak ke baad sanghathan ke pravaktaa vinod bansal ne bataaya ki desh ke pratishthit vishvavidhyalay ke samskruti virdohi charitra se chintit viechpi ne ek prastaav paarit kiya he
 It has been said in the proposal that for the last few days, a few students and teachers of the university are distributing 'poisonous fruits' by becoming 'toxic trees'
 unhone kaha, vahaan ke vidhyaarthiyon or praadhyaapakon ko samajhnaa chahie ki adhikaar kii bhi ek seemaa he, jiskaa baar-baar atikaraman kiya ja rahaa he
 When such unforgivable crimes will happen in the temple of education, then what will our younger generation take out? input: IANS In its manifesto for Uttar Pradesh elections, BJP has promised to make anti-romeo squad
 party ke mutabik ye squad 'college jane vaali ladakiyon kii suraksha sunishchit karne' or 'mahilaon se chhedchhad kii ghatnaon ko rokane' ke liye banaae jaaenge or inhen collejon ke paas tainaat kiya jayega
 The style of the bjp's entire manifesto can be easily understood from where the party's target is? Issues like Ram Mandir, Teen Divorce and Kairana 'exodus' have also been included in the election manifesto
 ye dekhnaa mushkil nahin he ki bijepi anti romeo squad banane kii baat kah kar kis tarah ke uksaave kaa sanket de rahi he
 1
 kya ye 'lav jihad' kii vaapasi he?'lav jihad' jumale kaa pehali baar 2009 main kerala or karnataka main istemaal kiya gaya tha jab hindu or isai samoohon kii ore se aarope lagaaya gaya tha ki unki ladakiyon ko muslim yuvaaon kii ore se phuslaa kar shaadi kii jaati he or phir islam dharm kabool kara diya jaataa he
 
 'lav jihad' kaa jumala phir jaldi hi bhula diya gaya
 It was heard again in 2014, particularly in Uttar Pradesh, where caste and religion play a decisive role for voters
 rashtriya str par 'lav jihad' 2014 main tab surkhiyon main aayaa jab meerut main ek mahila ne aarope lagaaya ki mujffarnagar main uske saath ek madrase main gangrape kiya gaya or phir islam dharm jabaran kabool karaayaa gaya
 It was also alleged that more girls were held hostage in the madrasa
 
 Right-wing groups were quick to react after the woman made the allegations
 rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (aresas) se jude dharm jaagran manch ne 'lav jihad' se 'ladane' ke hinduon kaa aahvaan karte hue abhiyaan ched diya tha
 Before the 2014 by-elections in Uttar Pradesh, the RSS placed 'love Jihad' on the cover of its mouthpieces - Panchjanya and Organizer

 naitik police kya ab aupchaarik police?bijepi kii ore se anti romeo sowod ke gathan kaa vaada kiye jane ke baad se moral pulising ke samarthan main bahes phir sataha par aa gai he
 Some groups who give the slogan of Hindutva may again come up on this issue by taking the name of 'sanskari' India
 oktober 2014 main bijepi ke yuva wing, bhartiya janata yuva morcha ke kaaryakartaaon ne kerala ke kosicode main ek restraan main todphod kii thi
 He claimed that 'immoral activities' take place in the restaurant
 iske ek saal baad mangalore main hindu ladki ke saath maujuud ek muslim ladke par hamalaa kiya gaya tha
 In this incident too, right wing activists were suspected
 aisi ghatnaon kii punrariti sidhe is baat par nirbhar karti he ki aise maamalon main doshiyon par police-prashasan kii ore se kya karrwai kii jaati he
 Before Valentine's Day, another effect of 'protection of college going girl students' in the election manifesto can be revealed
 isse kuch sanghathano ko 'naitik police' banane kaa bahaanaa mil saktaa he

 Romeo is considered one of Shakespeare's greatest literary works, before Romeo was named Shakespeare
 sade shabdon main kaha jaae to romeo wo du:khant premi he jise juliet ke saath shaadi kar khushi se phir puri jindagi bitaane kaa mauka nahin mila
 In such a situation, it is indeed a tragedy to associate the men of war and goons with the name of Romeo
 isi tarah shohade kism ke ladakon ko majanu kaa naam die janaa bhi galat he
 It would have been better for Shakespeare to read something before the party was added to Rome for the protection of women
 krishi se jude audyogic kshetra main mandi par chintaa jaahir karte hue pramukh vaahan company mahindra and mahindra ne kaha ki aagaamee bajet main sarkaar ko krishi kshetra kii utpaadakta badhaane par dhyaan kendrit karnaa chaiye, na ki bharan poshan sunishchit karne ke liye sabsidi badhaane par jor dena chaiye
 Pawan Goenka, president of Mahindra & Mahindra (automotive & Form Equipment Sector), said, “growth in the tractor industry has been very slow in the last three to four months
 vastav main pichley do maheenon ke dauraan vruddhi kam rahi he
 He said, this is not only for the tractor industry but it has happened in every sector which is related to agriculture
 philhal chintaa yah he ki krishi utpaadon par kaaphi dabaav he
 Calling for a long-term solution, Goenka said that in the upcoming budget, the focus would be on increasing productivity rather than subsidies
 unhone kaha ki isliye mashinikaran, jal sangrakshan athwa laghu sinchai athwa fasal dekharekh se judi kisi bhi cheez par dhyaan dene kaa is udyog par sakaaratmak prabhaav hoga or gramin arthvyavastha or krishi par bhi dderghaavadhik asar hoga
 Goenka said that the Finance Minister will have to do something in the direction of rural areas, either increase the subsidy or take some other measures
 automotive kshetra main prastaavit ‘dijal kar’ par tippanee karte hue unhone kaha, agar dijal vaahanon par koi kar lagaaya jaataa he to yah is udyog ko or sust kar degaa jiske liye pehle se hi 2011 kaa varsh mushkilon vaala varsh rahaa he
 He further said that doing so can affect the expansion plans of Mahindra & Mahindra
 dijal kar kaa virodh karte hue unhone kaha, hamaara maananaa he ki sarkaar ko dijal keemton ko badhaakar bazaar aadhaarit karnaa chaiye, petrol kii jagah dijal vaahanon ke prayog badhaane ko protsaahit karnaa chaiye or is prakaar tel aayaat kharch main kami lani chaiye
 On the possibility of a two percent increase in Central Value Added Tax (CENVAT), he said that the auto industry was expecting it to remain at par with 2011 as 2011 was not a good year and 2012 also appears to be a difficult year
 unhone kaha, haalanki sakht rajkoshiya sthiti ke kaaran ham (auto kshetra) is bajet main kisi utprerak kii ummid nahin kar rahe hai, mujhe ummid hogi ki bajet main senwatt shulk main badhotaree jaise koi hatotsahit karne vaali cheez nahin ho
 Goenka said that if there is any such increase, then its burden will be put on the customers immediately

 Everything is getting smarter on the increasing age of technology
 pehle phone smart hue, phir spikar or naa jaane ghar samet kya-kya chijen smart ho gayi
 With this practice, Titan also smartened his wallet and launched a wallet called Titan Radar
 agar aap wolet istemaal karte hai to aap jaanate honge ki apana wolet kho dena kitna dardabhra hota he
 Because you keep a lot of cards, cash and documents in it
 isi pareshaani se bachaane ke liye titan ne apane wolet ko bluetooth connactivity ke saath utaara jo phone se conect hokar aapako wolet ke dur jate hi alert karne lagata he
 We have used this wallet and now we are going to tell you its review
 company ne isaki keemat 2,995 rupee rakhi he
 Let's try to find out whether this wallet is worth the money
 dizin:dizin kii baat karen to hamane jo rivyuu ke liye unit yuj kiya he wo blike color vaala he
 You can see more colors of this by visiting the company's website
 ye ek pyor ledar kaa bana hua wolet he
 That is, you will be able to use it for a long time
 isaki phinishing or fabric kaaphi durable he saath hi yahaan stiching bhi kaaphi baariki se kii gai he
 Here you will find a lot of separation to store cards and cash
 rhite said main bane pocket main hi bluetooth chip ko jagah di gai he
 Which is smaller in size but as thick as 5 rupee coins
 aise main uske hone se aapako pareshaani mahasoos nahin hogi
 Connectivity and features: Titan Radar is a Bluetooth smart wallet that requires Bluetooth for connectivity
 ise conect karne ke liye google play store se Titan Radar bluetooth wolet kaa ap downlod karnaa hoga
 After that all your details have to be entered in the app
 wolet ko conect ke liye aapako wolet ke inner pocket main maujuud chip ko nikaalnaa hoga
 Then its cap has to be removed
 yahaan aapako bydaree ke upar ek rap najar aayega, use hataanaa hoga
 After this the wallet has to be searched from the app
 iske baad aapako wolet peyar ho jayega
 This wallet will give you ring alert as soon as you go out of range
 ye wolet aapako phone par ap par hi aakhri disconected lokation GPS pojishan disple karegaa
 In this, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology has been used for Bluetooth connectivity
 ye lo power kanjum karata he
 At least ios 9 in iphone to do phone from wallet
 3 OS or android main kam se kam 4
 4 kitkat OS support is required
 parformens:titan radar wolet main ek batan bydaree ke saath BLE (lo energy bluetooth) chipset diya gaya he
 The company claims that the Titan Radar can be run for 6 months with a single battery
 jaahir taur par hamane rivyuu ke dauraan itnaa samay nahin liya he to isaki pushti nahin kii ja sakati
 However, it is very easy to replace the battery after it runs out
 yuj karne ke liye phone kaa bluetooth on karen or ap se wolet ko peyar kar len
 The app will automatically detect the wallet
 parformens kii baat karen to mujhe nijee taur par rivyuu ke dauraan aisa laga ki wolet range se baahar jate hi ring alert jarur karata he
 But after coming back in range, it does not have the feature of auto connectivity
 aise main ek baar range se baahar jane ke baad aapako yaad se ise riconect karnaa hoga
 Apart from this, the good thing is that it has the GPS position of the last disconnected location and you can access the map with a click here
 auto connactivity kii samasya ke alaava isamen ek samasya ye bhi he ki ise ek baar discnect hone ke baad hamen dobaaraa conect karne par irr najar aayaa
 Also, it has a range of only 30 feet, it could be extended
 faisla:hamen rivyuu ke dauraan connactivity ko lekar kabhi-kabhi samasya ai or auto connactivity feechar kaa naa hona isaki ek negative baat he
 The rest of this wallet is good in every respect
 aise main yadi aap apana wolet khone se darate hai to titan ke is bluetooth wolet main paise laga sakate hai

 ajtak ke 'sidhi baat' kaarykram main rahul kanwal se baatcheet karte hue kamalnath ne kaha ki agar unhen siem banane ko kaha jayega to wo jarur banenge
 Kamal Nath also said that the government will bring a proposal for amendment of the People's Representation Bill in this session, under which a public representative convicted by a court will not be able to sit in the House until the High Court has given a stay on the sentence
 daagi saansadon par puche gaye sawaal ke jawaab main kamalnath ne kaha, 'congress party iske paksh main nahin he ki aapako kisi bhi court se ek baar sazaa ho jaae, to aap loksabhaa main yaa vidhansabha main sadsy bane rahen
 Its amendment, which is the amendment, we will bring in this session
 ham supreme court main yah sanshodhan laa rahe hai
 Kamal Nath said, 'we are not saying that if he is conceived, he should go and sit in the Lok Sabha the next day
 ye praavdhaan to he ki wo 3 maheene jaakar baith saktaa he, par ham iske aage ja rahe hai
 We are saying that you will not be able to sit
 ham yah sanshodhan laa rahe hai ki jab tak aapako chhot na mili, uske hair court se, jab aapako chhot mili, ste mili to aap aaie
 The law which was earlier before the Supreme Court Judgment, was that you appealed and you came back in the Lok Sabha

 On the question of increasing demand for partition of other states on the declaration of separate Telangana, Kamal Nath said, "the division of the state is done with far-reaching thinking
 60 saal se yah movement chal rahaa he
 We have done everything thoughtfully
 bodoland or gorkhaland kii maang to 15-20 saal se ho rahi he, par 65 saal se telugun kii maang thi
 Telangana wanted justice
 'kamalnath ne kaha, 'ab raajnneetik dalon ne isamen sahmati banaai or yah tay kiya, to isamen congress party kaa kya kasoor? baaki rajyon par vichaar kiya jayega

 The State Reorganization Commission is required from time to time, so it will be considered
 ' In the past years, the government has made continuous efforts to improve the quality of food available in trains, but there is no significant change in this matter
 in tamaam upayon se hua yah he ki khaanaa kaaphi mahangaa ho gaya he
 Great food at an affordable price seems like a dream for rail passengers
 ummid he ki vitt mantri is baar bajet main koi aisa bada kadam uthaaengi jisase trainon main khaane kii quality vastav main sudhar jaae
 It is not just about the food you get on the train
 steshnon par bikne vaale food kii gunvattta main sudhaar nahin ho paa rahaa
 There were reports that toilet water is being used to cook food in many trains
 iarsitisi ke alaava kai nijee vendor se khaanaa pahunchane kii vyavastha shuru kii gai he
 But this system is also limited to a few major stations, that is, if your train is at some big stations, then this facility can be provided, but the rest is not available
 isse zyada sharmnaak baat or kya hogi ki 21veen sadi main ham apane desh ke nagarikon ko saaf-suthra khaanaa bhi muhaiyaa nahin kar sakate!antarim bajet main is bare main charchaa nahin kii gai ki trainon main milane vaale khaane kii quality main sudhaar ke liye kya kadam uthaae jaaenge
 So now it is expected from this full budget that the new finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman will make some efforts in this direction
 pentry car se milane vaale khaane kii quality main khaas sudhaar nahin ho paaya he
 Even the Railways planned to reduce the weight of food to increase quality
 kai train main milane vaale khaane ke vajan main 150 gram kami karne kaa prastaav rakhaa he
 There is also a provision to appoint a manager in every train to check the food of the pantry car in the railway, which will check the quality of food
 lekin iskaa abhi bahut kuch phayda nahin dikh rahaa
 The CAG admitted it is bad
 a 2017 report of the qualitytcag shows that the food available in trains is not up to the prescribed standards
 bhartiya railway cataring and tourism corporation (iarsitisi) trainon main khaane kii aapurti karata he
 IRCCT officials say that the price of the actual food served by him has reached Rs 150, while he gets only Rs 112 on a plate
 jabaki sach yah he jis str or maatra kaa khaanaa pentry car se miltaa he utana or us str kaa khaanaa baahar saamaanya dhabon main 70 se 80 rupee thali main mil jaataa he
 To reduce the cost of food, IRCTC decided to reduce the quantity of lentils to 150 grams and to serve 150 grams of boneless chicken gravy instead of chicken
 sudharegi pentry kaaron kii haalat!pichley saal hi railway ne daawa kiya tha ki safar ke dauraan yatriyon ko milane vaale kharaab quality ke khaane se yatriyon ko nijaat mil jaaegi
 It will first start in premium trains, after which it will be implemented in other trains
 daawa to yahaan tak he ki yatriyon ko airlines jaisaa khaanaa milegaa or vahaan par isi tarah kii sarvice milegi
 Railways will improve the condition of trains which are equipped with pantry cars
 iske liye pentry car main khaanaa banane ke liye alag se bhandaaran kii vyavastha bhi kii jaaegi
 Along with this, the idea of making a place to wash dishes is going on
 toilet ke paas nahin rakhaa jayega khaane-pine kaa samacexsar aapane dekha hoga ki kai trainon main khaane-pine kaa saamaan toilets ke paas rakhaa jaataa he, jiske baad isaki supplai yatriyon ko kii jaati he
 The chance of getting infected with this type of food increases greatly and travelers can also fall ill
 daawa yah bhi he ki hai dephination camere se ab train main parose jane vaale khaane kii saamagree par najar rakhi jaaegi
 Overall, it can be said that despite all these efforts, the quality of food available in trains has not improved much, so the Finance Minister will have to take some concrete measures for this in the budget

 He began to salute the people who came there
 jurm kii duniya main pehla kadamdarasal, chalis ke dashak main videsh se jo log electronic saamaan, mahangi ghadiyaan yaa sona, chaandi or gahane lekar aate the
 They had to pay a huge amount of tax on the goods
 yahi vajah thi ki dock par taskari karnaa ek phaayde kaa sauda tha
 Ghalib's talk was understood by Mastan
 usne is maukey ko haath se jane nahin diya
 And secretly he started helping the smugglers
 taskar videshon se sone ke biscuit or anya saamaan laakar mastaan ko dete the or vah use apane kapadon or thile main chhipaakar dock se baahar le jaataa tha

 This possibility was probably based on the fact that i had very wide experience of the government, while Manmohan Singh had vast experience of being a long-time bureaucrat and reformist finance minister for five years

 filmi parade se 2004 main siyasat main entry karne vaali hema malini duusari baar sansad main daakhile main mathura se kismat aajamaa rahi hai
 Hema won from Mathura in 2014, but this time Basanti's victory is a bit difficult
 haalanki, hema malini apni jeet ko lekar aashwast hai
 This time her husband Dharmendra is also campaigning for her
 aaie jaanate hai senester, riter, doirector, produsar or dancer hema ke raajnneetik safar ke bare main-16 oktober 1948 ko madras state (tamilnadu) ke ammankudi main janmin hema ne apane raajnneetik safar kii shuruyaat bataur prachaarak kii thi
 In 1999, Hema campaigned for BJP candidate Vinod Khanna from Gurdaspur in Punjab
 raashtrapati apije abdul kalam ne 2003 main hema malini ko rajyasabha ke liye namit kiya tha
 From 2003 to 2009, Hema was a member of the Rajya Sabha
 is bich 2004 main hema ne bijepi jwoin kiya
 Became BJP general secretary in 2011 and started campaigning for BJP candidates
 2014 ke chunaav main bijepi ne hema ko uttar pradesh kii mathura seat se utaara
 Hema defeated rld's Jayant Chaudhary by 3,30,743 votes and became a member of the Lok Sabha for the first time
 is baar phir vah maidan main hai
 In front of him, Mahagathbandhan candidate Narendra Singh and Mahesh Pathak from the Congress are in the fray
 abaki baar bhi basanti kii jeet pakki karne ke liye unke saath veeru yani dharmedra aa gaye hai
 Dharmendra also campaigned fiercely with Hema
 dharmendra or hema kii hit jodi ko dekhne ke liye jan sailaab umad padaa or chunavi manch se dharmendra ne hema ke liye bilkul filmi style main vot maange
 Dharmendra rushed to Mathura from Mumbai to campaign for his wife Hemalini
 bilkul usee tarah saath nibhaane- jaise silver screen ke parde par saath nibhaate the
 The series of closeness between this super hit pair of silver screen started from the 1970 film Tum Hasin, Main Jawaan
 hemamalini or dharmendra kii jodi ko logon ne jamkar saraahaa
 In the film Sita and Geeta then the pair came to rock the crowd
 ek ore hemamalini kaa khubusurat cheharaa
 On the other hand Dharmendra's image of an upright and sharif young man
 hindustan ke darshakon ko bhaane lagi
 Film by film, Dharminder and Hema began to grow closer
 1975 main ai film sholay main ek ore chulabuli tanga chalaane vaali basanti yani hemamalini to duusari ore gabbar singh jaise daaku se loha lete viru yani dharmendra
 On one hand, the silver screen made Veeru and Basanti a super star, while in real life, both of them started diving into the ocean of love
 lekin, shaadi ke bandhan main bandhana aasaan nahin tha
 He was married when Dharmendra fell in love with Hema
 hema ke pita ko ye bardaasht nahin tha ki unki beti kisi shaadishuda shaks ke shaadi kare
 In such a situation, Hema finally got married to Dharmendra in 1980 after the death of his father
 hema ko unke chaahanewaalon ne dreamgirl kaa naam diya to dharmendra ko nai pahchaan mili himain kii
 Time kept moving forward, the characters kept changing
 hema malini siyasat main aa gayi
 In 2004, Hema entered politics and in 2014 she became an MP from Mathura
 is baar phir vah mathura se maidan main hai
 This time, Hema Malini is pitted against RLD ticket Kunwar Narendra Singh and Congress's Mahesh Pathak
 mathura main chunavi muqabla trikoniya he
 Hema Malini also knows that the fight with SP BSP and RLD has become tremendous

 The Congress has questioned the state government's statement of allotment of land beyond the criteria laid down in the land policy of Robert Vadraco Haryana
 congress kaa aarope he ki party adhyakshasonia gandhi ke damaadke khilaaf ‘kishton main manahani abhiyaan’ chalaaya ja rahaa he
 Party spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi told reporters in New Delhi, 'we have already fully demonstrated that this is nothing but defamation campaign being conducted in installments
 yah kuch nahin he balki ek hi mudde ko khinchne vaali baat he, jisamen ucchadhikariyon kii teen sadasyeey samiti ko koi aniyamitata nahin mili he
 Singhvi was replying to questions asked in relation to the reports which said that two senior Haryana government officials investigating the case have now found that Vadra's company 'skylight Hospitality' has been set by the government
 More land is owned by the owner
 singhvi ne kaha, ‘haryana sarkaar dwaara gathit samiti ne koi aniyamitata nahin paayi thi
 Now a new government and a new chief minister have taken over the reins of the state and after that a new committee of junior officers of the first three officers was formed, which was further explored

 On the 125th birth anniversary of Bhimrao Ambedkar, it cannot be a great irony of the government that the dalit is of interest to the Dalits that the Ministry is not getting even the same amount of applications for this scholarship
 aisa nahin he ki dalit chaatro kii kami he, balki abhi bhi jaankaree kaa abhaav he or prashasnic tantra kii pechidgiyaan use daraati hai
 bjp's Dalit leader and former Union Minister Sanjay Paswan tells India Today, "no political party understands the aspirations of the new generation of Dalit youth
 daliton ke saath khaane or nahaane ke dikhaawati pratikon se kuch nahin hoga
 This society understands the language of the eyes, not the figures
 ab hamen nai peedi ke dalit yuvaaon se baat kerani hogi
 "they also say," Congress, communists and socialists talk about caste with a conscious mind, whereas BJP always does it with a subconscious mind
 isliye haal kii ghatnaon ko samajhane or paristhitiyon ko aankane main hamase galtiyaan hui hai
 "actually, the bjp's dilemma about Dalit politics pushes it backfoot on the Rohit Vemula episode, sometimes against Dayashankar Singh's indecent speech against Mayawati and sometimes in the Una episode
 kya he bijepi kaa asamanjasbijepi kii sabase badi chunauti modi lahar main loksabhaa 2014 ke chunaav main hasil 24 fisadi dalit vot ko apane saath banaae rakhane kii he
 In this, he won all the 17 reserved seats of the Scheduled Castes in Uttar Pradesh and won a tremendous victory in 39 of the 84 secured seats in the Lok Sabha
 hindi pattee main bijepi ko 34 fisadi dalit vot mili the
 But there is confusion over the way the recent events have made the party's image anti-dalit as the Assembly elections are due in UP next year
 upi kaa chunaav bijepi kii narendra modi-amit shah jodi ke liye agnipariksha he kyonki rashtriya str par unke utthan main isaki nirnaayak bhoomika thi
 On March 3, 2014, as Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi said in an election meeting in Muzaffarpur, Bihar, on the fifth day of Ram Vilas Paswan's Lok Janshakti Party joining the NDA, "BJP called Brahmin and Banis Party is now Dalit-backward a party has been formed
 aane vaala vakt daliton-pichhadon kaa hi he
 "there was also a complete basis behind these statements of Modi
 loksabhaa chunaav ke vakt mayawati ko chhodkar bijepi ne sabhi pramukh dalit chehron ko apane saamaajik sameekaran ke guladaste main sajaa liya tha
 In Delhi, Udit Raj, who openly went to Mahishasura celebrations and adopted Buddhism against Hinduism, joined him, then took Paswan in Bihar, because of the riots in Gujarat under Modi's chief minister, because of Atal Bihari Vajpayee Resigned from the NDA government headed by him
 isi tarah maharashtra main ramdaas athawale kii party arpiai or tamilnadu main vijayakaanth kii party ko joda tha
 But the way the party is facing adversity on the Dalit issue after coming to power, it has emphasized the muscle of the BJP
 bijepi ke ek varisht netaa kehete hai, ''pichley 20-25 saalon main dalit raajnneeti itani dhardaar or pratikriyaavaadi ho gai he ki bijepi ke saamaajik aadhaar se vah mail nahin kha paa rahi
 Therefore, at times, strategically, the contradiction starts
 "sangh poshit pratikon kii dalit raajnneetibijapi kii dalit duvidha ko samajhane ke liye itihaas par najar daalana hoga
 The social base of the BJP was generally up to the middle and upper castes
 sangh-bijepi kii sanghathanaatmak sanrachana kii agali qatari main hameshaa savarna hi haaavee rahe hai
 Therefore, the Sangh was also working on a strategy to change this image
 sangh se jude ek padaadhikari bataate hai, ''1967 main daliton ke sanghathan dies-4 or baad main bispi ne brahman-baniyon ke khilaaf tilak-taraazoo or talwaar jaise kai naare gadhe or khulkar virodh kiya
 But to give a message to the Dalits, the Sangh had advised the BJP three times to tie up with Mayawati
 " sabase pehle ram mandir andolan ke ufaan ke baavjood jab 1993 ke chunaav main bijepi upi main sarkaar nahin bana pai to 1995 main mayawati ko samarthan dene kaa faisla liya
 Kalyan Singh was completely against it then, but the Sangh decided to give support to convey the message to the Dalits
 1997 main bhi ise doharaaya gaya
 Similarly, despite the reluctance of Rajnath Singh in 2002, BJP again supported Mayawati
 lekin is tarah ke pratikon se daliton main paith banane kii sangh-bijepi kii koshish paravaan nahin chadh pai
 While doing politics of symbols, the Sangh had also laid the first brick with Dalit leader Kameshwar Paswan in the foundation stone of Ram temple
 pratikon ke jariye daliton kaa himachati dikhne kii kavayad bijepi kii madhya pradesh sarkaar ne dow
 By constructing a memorial at Ambedkar's birthplace Mhow, the Ambedkar Niwas at Alipur Road in Delhi were built as Ambedkar National Memorial during the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government at the center
 or ab modi sarkaar ne landan sthit unka ghar kharidne or unki 125veen jayanti ke jariye saamaajik dayera badhaane kii pahal kii
 In April 2015, the mouthpiece Panchajanya of the Sangh published Ambedkar issue
 sangh kii sanstha seva bharti dalit ilaakon main to vanavaasi kalyaan ashram or ekal vidhyalay adivaasiyon ke liye kaam karte hai
 But through these works, the rhetoric of the BJP leaders on the basis which the Sangh prepares
 haalanki mayawati ke khilaaf abhadra tippanee karne vaale dayashankar ko bijepi ne chand ghanton main party se baahar kaa rasta dikhaa diya
 The Una incident also put the party on the defensive in Parliament
 damege control kii bhagava ranneetidyashankar prakaran ke fouran baad sangh ke sah-sarkarywah krishna gopal ne rajnath singh ke nivas par bijepi adhyaksh amit shah or anya varisht netaaon ke saath do daur kii mantranaa kii
 Further strategy was considered in this
 bijepi ke ek netaa kii daleel he, ''rohit vemula prakaran ho yaa una kii ghatana, sajeesh ke tahat secular brigade isamen bijepi ko ghaseet rahi he kyonki secular kheme ko ehsaas ho gaya he ki sampradayikta ke mudde par bijepi ko katghare main khadaa karnaa use siyaasi phayda detaa he
 Therefore, efforts are being made to discredit the BJP on the social agenda
 " haalanki ve yah maanate hai ki saamaajik dharanaon kii ladaai main party baikfoot par he
 The Sangh is currently silent on this issue as the social harmony campaign started after the meeting of the House of Representatives of Nagpur has received a setback
 sangh ne ek mandir, ek kuna, ek shmashaan ke naare ke saath abhiyaan shuru kiya tha jisamen saamaajik aadhaar ko badhaane kii pahal kii gai
 But recent events have derailed the Sangh's agenda
 ab sangh ne 18 agast ko raksha bandhan ke maukey par manaae jane vaale raksha parv ke liye is baar khaas taiyaari kii he
 Volunteers have been instructed to tie rakhi to Dalit sisters and go and interact in their homes, so that an atmosphere of social harmony can be created again
 sangh ab gorakshak dal jaise apane sampark ke sanghathanon par nigaraanee rakhane kii ranneeti bana rahaa he
 Una incident in Anandiben Patel's departure from Chief Minister's post in Gujarat has become an immediate cause
 bijepi ke ek netaa kaa kahana he ki agar umr paimaana hota to unhen may 2014 main mukhyamantri banaaya hi nahin jaataa
 BJP president Shah has also warned the UP team to control rhetoric in the electoral rout
 iske baad upi bijepi adhyaksh keshav prasad maury ne padaadhikariyon kii baithak main bhi is chetavanee ko doharaaya
 In UP, the BJP has instructed all its 17 Dalit mps to hold goodwill ceremonies and increase migration to Dalit areas, while in other states, Dalit leaders have been asked to run campaigns to uphold Dalits' trust by creating a new social platform from their level
 bihar main sanjay paswan ne 21 (bihar ke purv siem bholaa paswan kii jayanti), 23 (dinakar jayanti), 25 sitambar (dinadayal upaadhyaay jayanti) ko neshnal soshal summit kaa aayojan kiya he
 The party has come up with a four-pronged strategy to fight perception at the national level
 pehali—yojanabaddh tareeke se jawaab dena, jisamen dalit atyaachaar ke aankadon ko tulanaatmak rup main rakhana
 Second, to establish direct contact with the Dalits at the lower levels, especially the non-jatav Dalits
 upi se paasi samaaj kii krishna raaj ko mantri banaakar party ne gaiyr jatvon ko sandesh diya he
 In this, under the stand-up India, the loan given to the Dalits is to talk about the new entrepreneurs and the benefits of the Mudra Bank Scheme
 teesri—sangh ke network kaa istemaal kar daliton main chhavi sudhaar kii kavayad
 Under this, joining the defense festival
 chauthi—zyaadaatar dalit netaaon ko bijepi se jodgaye kii koshish, taaki yah sandesh jaae ki party daliton ke saath he
 According to sources, under this strategy, it has become a strategy to bring a lot of Dalit leaders from the BSP into the party
 bijepi maan chuki he ki daliton main jatav vot ko tod paanaa mumkin nahin, isliye party gaiyr jatav vot par hi focus kar rahi he
 But the bjp's Dalit leaders and thinkers believe that for this too, the image of a cow larger than humanity will have to be changed
 saath hi daliton kaa vishwaas jeetne ke liye pehle use parikrama nahin, parakram vaale dalit netaa khadey karne honge
 Baba Ramdev, who started a campaign against black money from the fort of Chhattisgarh, has supported the demands of the Naxalites
 haalanki unhone kaha ki naksali apni maang rakhane ke liye jo tarika apana rahe hai, wo galat he
 Baba Ramdev said that the demand of Naxalites regarding natural resources is correct and i support it
 iske saath unhone kaha ki naksaliyon ko apane muddon ko uthaane ke liye loktantric tarika apnaanaa chahie

 Many parties are criticizing this decision of the Governor
 ajtak se khaas baat karte hue bhi rajyapalsatyapalamalik ne is faisle ke peeche ke kaaran bhi bataae
 He said that he feared there might be horse-trading to form the government, so he had to take this decision
 unhone ye bhi kaha ki unhenmahabooba muftiya sajaad lone kii ore se koi khat nahin mila
 Apart from this, a statement was made by Raj Bhavan that the Governor decided to dissolve the Assembly with immediate effect due to important reasons, including the possibility of "wide-ranging horse trading" and the coming together of parties with "anti-political ideologies impossible to form a stable government" Things like '' are included

 bayaan main kaha gaya ki iske alaava pichley kuch varsh kaa anubhav yah bataata he ki khandit janadesh se sthai sarkaar bananaa sambhav nahin he
 The coming together of such parties is an attempt to gain power instead of forming a responsible government
 bayaan main aage kaha gaya, ‘‘vyapak kharid farokht hone or sarkaar banane ke liye behad alag raajnneetik vichaardhaaraon ke vidhayakon kaa samarthan hasil karne ke liye dhan ke len dein hone kii ashanka kii reportein hai, aisi gatividhiyaan loktantr ke liye hanikaarak hai or raajnneetik prakriya ko dooshit karti hai

 diggaj boxr mohammad ali ke bete ko isi maheene america ke florida main antarrashtriya hawaii adde par hiraasat main liya gaya tha
 On Friday, it was revealed that Muhammad Ali Jr
 was detained in the wake of an executive order on the immigration of US President Donald Trump
 is dauraan mohammad ali junior se poocha gaya ki kya aap muslim hai?mohammad ali junior apni maa ke saath 7 farvari ko jamaica se aa rahe the, tabhiavrajan adhikariyonne unhen hiraasat main liya or 30 minute tak unase poochtacha kii
 Despite having no criminal record and having a US passport, his religion was asked
 is dauraan khaliha ali ne apane purv pati mohammad ali ke saath apni photo avrajan adhikariyon ko dikhaai, jiske baad unhen hiraasat main nahin liya gaya, jabaki mohammad ali junior kii us samay apane pita ke saath koi photo nahin thi
 Trump signed a travel ban on January 27, although a federal judge later stayed the order
 yah 2008 kii baat he
 Revenue Minister Anandiben Patel in the then Narendra Modi government of Gujarat visited the Jan Seva Kendra at Collectorate in Mehsana district
 unke adhikansh dauron kii tarah yah bhi auchak tha or ekal khidki vyavastha ke tahat praaanpatr jari karne vaale jan seva centre yaa saamudayik kendron kii jaanch ke liye tha
 She was impressed by the functioning of the Jan Seva Kendra of the District Collectorate and came to know that District Collector Ajay Bhadu has left a deep impression on the locals due to his efficiency and easy accessibility
 uske baad kisi ne nahin suna ki patel is iees adhikari se milin
 But within a month of Modi's place in the state, he appointed Bhadu as the secretary of the Chief Minister's Office
 vah koi iklauta vakya nahin tha
 In late October last year, the Chief Minister conducted a surprise inspection of two schools in the capital Gandhinagar and found the computer lab of one school closed
 skool ke adhikariyon se baat karne ke baad ve apane daftar laut ain or uske tatkaal baad rajya ke sarkari skulon main computer lab ke istemaal or rakrakhaav ko lekar ek sarkari aadesh jari kar diya
 In short, Patel's way of functioning is quite different from that of his predecessor
 ek prashaasak ke bataur modi apane bharose ke adhikariyon se mili jaankaree par zyada nirbhar rahete the
 His image was of a strict leader, which made the bureaucrats very worried about giving better results
 lekin patel auchak daure ke samay sthaneey logon se input hasil kar prashasnic karypranali kaa khud akalan karti hai
 This is part of their micromanagement strategy to deliver better administration
 agar anandiben main karishme or shaayad modi ke vijan kii kami he to us kami ko ve apni kadi mehnat se dur kar rahi hai
 His strategy has emerged with success, working first as a minister in Keshubhai Patel and then in the Modi cabinet
 or yah gujarat kii mukhyamantri ke taur par duusare saal main bhi behatar kaam karti najar aa rahi he
 So what is this change like in Gandhinagar? At least till now there is no complaining tone in the state bureaucracy
 modi ke saath kaam kar chuke anandiben patel ke pramukh sachiv ke
 Kailashnath explains that though the way of working of both is different but the focus of both is on the result
 ve kehete hai, "donon 18 ghante kaam karne vaale prashaasak hai
 "urban Development Secretary
 aar
 Aloria agrees, "his ability to make decisions is fast and transparent
 "or isse jaahir hota he ki ve bakhubi jaanati hai ki unhen kya chahie
 So while visiting the villages, she talks to the sarpanch and the patwari before talking to the collector to know what to say to the officer
 sthaneey samasyaon ko samajhane ke liye vibhinn vibhaagon ke adhikariyon ke saath baithak karne se pehle ve party ke sthaneey kaaryakartaaon ke saath bhi baithak karti hai
 India Today found the same while traveling with him on the Chief Minister's visit to Jamnagar
 kadi mehnat or yojanaon kii jaankaree lete rahane kii unki kaaryastylee se ek saal ke kaarykaal main unki chhavi ek kushal prashaasak kii ban gai he, jabaki rajasav or shahari vikaas mantri ke taur par pehle se hi unki chhavi ek samarpit prashaasak kii rahi he
 Last year, while handing over the power of Gujarat to Anandiben, Modi publicly praised him, saying that he has also fixed the important department like revenue but cumbersome
 unke paas 2007 se hi rajasav vibhaag tha
 Today, a year later, Anandiben seems to be furthering Modi's confidence
 lekin isi naukarshahi ke saath unki kamajoriyaan bhi saamne ai hai
 One of them is that he does not have the same fear among the officers as Modi used to be and his grip on administration is also weaker than Modi's
 patel ko iske alaava party sanghathan ke liye bahut kaam karnaa hoga
 Modi, with his personal appeal, leadership ability, tough temperament and reliable Amit Shah, had deep insight into the party from the lowest level to the top
 is maamle main pehle saal patel kii samaj kamjor najar aati he
 According to the changes made by him in the state BJP organization in recent times, it has been seen that poor performers have got more importance than those who do better
 bharat pandya ko party ke pradesh mahasachiv ke pad se hataa diya gaya he, jabaki unhone ek behatar sanghathankarta kaa parichay dete hue anandiben patel ke kaaryon ko party padaadhikariyon or aam logon ke bich pahunchane kaa behtareen kaam kiya tha
 It remains a mystery why they were removed
 sawaalon ke ghere main ai pradesh bijepi main yah badlaav aise samay main hua he, jabaki isi saal aktubar main rajya main panchayat or nigamon ke chunaav hone hai
 Patel faces another challenge
 unhen jati ke mudde kaa bhi puri takat se saamana karnaa padegaa, jiskaa modi ko saamana nahin karnaa padaa tha
 Modi belonged to the OBC community
 lekin ve varchasvshaalee patel samudaay se hai
 State Congress President Bharat Singh Solanki comes from a backward Kshatriya caste, a traditional rival of the Patels, and even more in number
 pradesh congress ke pravaktaa manish doshi kehete hai, "anandiben ke ek saal ke kaarykaal par yahi tippanee he ki ve police or kanoon vyavastha ke maamle main puri tarah vifal rahi hai
 "as he claims, unlike Modi's tenure, the Congress is still in a strong position
 lekin party netaaon or kaaryakartaaon kaa daawa he ki modi ke "wibrant gujarat" se patel ke "gatisheel gujarat" tak vistaar kamyaabi kii raah par he
 They are worth Rs 4,500 crore
 kii laagat se 170 main se 153 nagaron yaa chote kasbon main teji se chal rahe bhumigat jal nikasi pranali ke kaam kaa udhaaharan dete hai
 The underground drainage system has been completed in 45 of these 153 towns, including backward towns like Bayad and Dhanera in northern Gujarat, which until recently could not even imagine having a drainage system
 yahaan tak ki kendriya shahari vikaas mantralay ke aankadon ke mutabik, desh main chote kasbon main jal nikasi vyavastha sthapit karne vaale rajyon main gujarat sabase aage he
 Gujarat is also a pioneer in construction of toilets led by Anandiben, which is a major part of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan
 is abhiyaan kii ghoshnaa ke baad desh main ab tak garibon ke liye kul 2
 70 lakh toilets have been constructed, 1 of which
 61 lakh shauchalay akele gujarat main bane hai
 His view of the Human Development Index is similar to that of Modi
 modi kii gujarat sarkaar 18 saal tak ke chaatro ko hriday, kidney or cancer kaa muft ilaaj muhaiyaa karaati thi, patel ne 1 june se isamen mahilaon ke liye daant kii beemaari, chehre kii vikruti or sarvaaical or stan cancer or madhumeh kii jaanch ko shaamil kar diya he
 As a constituent of Vibrant Gujarat, he formed a project monitoring committee consisting of industrial policy and key officials
 uskaa kaam maharashtra, karnataka, andhra pradesh or tamilnadu jaise pratispardhi rajyon kii audyogic nitiyon or pragati kii tulana karnaa or pakshik rup se report dena he, taaki uske aadhaar par gujarat kii vaastavik pragati kaa akalan kiya ja sake
 His second biggest and important achievement is the finalization of 34 Urban Development Master Plans and 185 Municipal Planning Plans in just 18 months
 bijepi ke sthaneey netaaon ko lagata he ki haalanki patel kaa shashan unhen acchhee sthiti main rakhega par unke aparipakv rajnatik faislon kaa asar unke kushal prashasnic kaaryon par padegaa
 However, Anandiben is confident that her party will win with her landmark decision of 50 per cent reservation for women in her better works and body elections
 anandiben ausat vaktaa hai par apane bhaashanon ke dauraan unki koshish logon ko yah samajhane kii hoti he ki ve dher sari sarkari yojanaon kaa kis tarah se phayda uthaa sakate hai
 Even though his speech is not charismatic compared to Modi, his subject is good
 ve kahati hai, "main gambhirthapurvak kaam karne or kaam ke prati apana sau fisadi dene main yakeen rakhti hum
 If you do well then the results will definitely improve
 " unki pehali asal pariksha nikaay chunaav hai, jo is saal ke aakhir main hone hai
 Their result will determine the tone of Anandiben's last two years
 bhartiya pradhanmantri narendra modi ne somvaar ko sanyukt arab emirate (yuai) ke vyavsaayiyon se bharat main nivesh karne kaa aagrah kiya
 He said that there is a possibility of investing 10 trillion dollars in India

 isse pehle modi ne abu dhabi main masadar shahar kaa daura kiya, jo svachh praudyogiki kaa ek centre he
 Modi is currently on a two-day visit to the UAE
 unhone abu dhabi ke carbon free masadar shahar main niveshkon ke ek sammelan ko sambodhit karte hue vaada kiya ki beete 34 saalon main kisi bhartiya pradhanmantri kaa yahaan daura na hone ke kaaran ai khalipan kii bharpai kii jaaegi

 The Indian Film Industry should come out in open and take a stand against the humilation of National Film Awardees who are going to skip the award ceremony today
 Dark day in the history of # nationalfilmawardsrespected @rashtrapatibhvn, # nationalawards are 1 of the few genuine & dignified awards that we in the # filmindustry wait for
 We work hard for it & expect respect for what we create
 Pained to know that u don’t hv time to be with the winners & aren’t presenting all the awardsi think it is happening for the first time in 65 years that awardees of # nationalfilmawards wont be felicitated by @rashtrapatibhvn
 Only 11 out of 141 will get awards from the President
 This is how the best of Indian Cinema is being treated
 # sadit is unfortunate Hon'ble President of India has not been able to find time to present ALL National Film Awards that show case India's creativity, performing arts & soft power
 President should reconsider as awards presented by the office he represents carries different gravitassadly, even the President doesn't care for the # nationalfilmawards
 He's allocated just one hour from his 'busy' schedule, to distribute trophies
 The idea of state honouring artists anyway is distasteful
 And then to pick & choose a select few for the award ceremony is humiliating them further, and doing disservice to, almost mocking, their talents
 # nationalfilmawardshttps: / / t
 co / 36ejn8ld7kone of the reason the National Film Awards are prestigious because they are handed by the @rashtrapatibhvn -not a minister

 scindia ne modi sarkaar ko katghare main rakhte hue poocha carlert ke baad bhi kaise hamalaa ho gaya
 Was the government sleeping? Five questions from the Congress government: 1
 pakistaniucchayukta ko bulaakar antarrashtriya manch par pathankot hamale kaa maamla kyon nahin uthaaya?2
 Why did the Home Minister tweet incorrectly and delete it later? Why didn't the PM or the Home Minister or the Defense Minister take control of the operation in their own hands? Why not constitute a clear command and control structure? 3
 suraksha main khami kaa jimmedaar koun? pradhanmantri bataaen ki intelligence alert ke baavjood pathankot airbase main aatankwaadi kaise ghus gaye? aatankiyon kii pehali ghatana or airbase main muthbhed ke bich 20 se 24 ghante kaa vakt beetaa

 kya raksha mantri aatankwaadiyon ke airbase tak pahunchane ke liye grih mantralay or punjab police ko jimmedaar tehra rahe hai? is chook se javaanon kii shahadat kaa jimmedaar koun he?5
 Is this terrorism related to drugs and have the infiltrating terrorists used the same methods, methods and logistic support that the drug traffickers do with the connivance of Punjab administration officials? After this, the BJP in turn retaliated by National Secretary Shrikant Sharma Landed on
 shrikant sharma ne congress par hamalaa bolte hue kaha ki congress party is maamle par siyasat kar rahi he
 Sharma said that the country has inherited terrorism from the Congress

 In the famous aarushi-hemraj murder case, the Allahabad High Court gave Dr
 rajesh or noopur talwaar ko bari kar diya he
 The High Court ruled that the Talwars did not kill Aarushi
 adaalat ke faisle ne to talwaar danpati ko raahat de di
 But again the question arises as to who killed Aarushi and Hemraj? The CBI court of Ghaziabad sentenced the Talwar couple to life imprisonment on 26 November 2013 after a long hearing on the case
 jiske baad ke unhone sibiai court ke faisle ke khilaaf elahabaad hoicourt main apil kii thi
 The Talwar couple are currently lodged in Dasna Jail in Ghaziabad
 hoicourt ke faisle ne sibiai kii jaanch par hi sawaal uthaae hai
 Even before the judge pronounced the verdict, he mentioned the flaw of the investigation
 court kii najar se dekhen to sibiai apni jaanch main vifal rahi
 Neither the CBI had extensive evidence nor witnesses
 aise main adaalat ne talwaar danpati ko laabh dete hue aarope se hi bari kar diya
 However, the CBI had argued in the court that the Talwars had seen Aarushi in an objectionable position with the servant and had taken this frightening step after that
 sibiai court ne jaanch karne vaali team kii daleelein maan lee thim
 After that Dr
 rajesh or noopur talwaar ko hatya kaa doshi qaraar diya gaya tha
 Later, while giving the verdict, both were sentenced to life imprisonment by the CBI court
 tab lag rahaa tha ki maamla ab saaf he
 But answers to some questions were yet to be found in the investigation
 ye vahi sawaal the jo ab hoicourt main talwaar danpati ke liye brahmastra sabit hue
 The lack of evidence and the weakness of the witnesses foiled all the arguments of the CBI before the High Court
 15-16 may, 2008 kii darmiyaani raat ko aarushi kii laash uske bistar par mili thi
 After this, one by one, so many dramatic incidents came to light that the entire matter was turned into a Chrissy crime thriller film
 isamen agle pal kya hoga ye kisi ko pataa nahin tha
 The UP police kept investigating the case but no result was found
 baad main jaanch sibiai ke hawaale kii gai thi
 People were hoping that the CBI would definitely expose the secret of Aarushi's murder
 lekin aisa nahin ho sakaa
 This murder was done in such a vicious manner that it was difficult to even think who the murderer was
 haalanki jab katl hua to shaq ghar ke naukar hemraj par kiya gaya
 But the next day when Hemraj's corpse was found on the roof of the house, the whole affair got entangled
 45 varshiya yama prasad banjade urf hemraj talwaar danpati kaa vafaadaar gharelu naukar tha
 Used to live with him only
 ghar kii chaabiyaan usee ke paas hoti thim
 He did not drink alcohol
 uskaa parivaar nepal main rahata tha
 The police, as always, were making big claims that they could not achieve anything
 yahaan tak ki upi police ne sibiai jaanch se pehle is maamle ko honor kiling bataaya tha
 At that time, the Noida Police had sensationally claimed that aarushi-hemraj's murderer was none other than her father Dr Rajesh Talwar
 is theory ke peeche police ne honor kiling kii daleel rakhi
 On May 23, 2008, Rajesh Talwar was arrested by the police for the murder of the daughter
 lekin tab tak maamle main itane mode aa chuke the ki murder kaa ye maamla ek blind cese ban chukaa tha
 The matter was in the limelight, so the UP government handed over the investigation of the aarushi-hemraj murder case to the CBI on May 31, 2008
 katl ke aarope main doctor rajesh talwaar salaakhon ke peeche the
 The Aarushi murder case was the subject of discussion throughout the country
 is dauraan talwaar kaa narco test hua
 By then the needle of suspicion had swung from the sword to his servants and compounders
 talwaar parivaar ke kareebi durrani parivaar ke ek naukar rajkumaar ko bhi giraftaar kiya gaya tha
 In 2010, two years later, the CBI filed a closure report
 sunwaayee chalati rahi or phir shaq kii sui aaropon kii shakl main ek baar phir talwaar danpati par jaakar tik gai thi
 The Ghaziabad court found the Talwar couple guilty of erasing evidence
 donon ke khilaaf aarushi-hemraj murder cese main shaamil hone ke aarope tay kiye gaye the
 But now the High Court acquitted the Talwar couple in this double murder case after 9 years
 nateeja ye ki 9 saal baad phir se vahi sawaal saamne aa gaya he ki aakhir aarushi or hemraj kaa katl kisne kiya tha
 Who is the killer of both? The answer to this question is yet to be found

 Statistics system should be autonomous and transparent in terms of collecting, compiling and disseminating statistics
 ise nishchit taur par raajnneetik hastkshep se mukt hona chahie
 India's statistical system has been under suspicion ever since the Central Statistics Office (CSO) released a new GDP series in 2015
 ye aankade aadhaar varsh ko badalakar 2011-12 ke aadhaar par jari kiye gaye the or isamen pichley varshon kii tulana main vikaas kii gati ko tej dikhaaya gaya
 Since then, there have been several occasions when the credibility of official figures has been questioned
 upie ke kaarykaal ke aankadon ke saath badlaav karnaa ho, notebandi ke varsh ke aankadon ko badha chadhaakar dikhaanaa ho, rashtriya namoona surveykshan sanghathan (NSSO) ke rojgaar ke aankade ko prasaarit hone se rokna ho, iske virodh main rashtriya sankhyikee ayog (NSC) ke chairman pisi mohanan or isaki sadsy jevi minakshi kaa istipha ho yaa phir rashtriya sankhyikee ayog ko darkinar karnaa ho
 The NITI Aayog played a big role in all this, however, it did not have the authority
 lekin sarkaar ke liye asuvidha utpann karne vaale aankadon ko kinare kar diya gaya
 Opposing these developments, 108 economists and sociologists expressed concern that the government was making political interference in the matter of statistical data
 in logon ne sankhyikee sanghathanon kii 'saansthanik swaittata' or 'satyanishtha' ko behaal karne ke liye abhiyaan chalaaya
 Autonomy of statistical system Many things have happened in the statistics department of India which is a serious matter for its reliability
 jaise mukhya sankhyikivid (CSI) ke pad par or rashtriya sankhyikee ayog (NSC) main niyuktiyaan
 The government changed the appointments of posts, interfering in the quality of data, autonomy, data collection and dissemination of them
 mukhya sankhyikivid or rashtriya sankhyikee ayog donon hi apni kaarypaddati main swatantra hai
 They are not part of the general bureaucracy of the government, their autonomy and transparency were ensured in 2006, based on the recommendations made in the Rangarajan Commission's report in 2001, but are now referred to by the Union Ministry of Statistics and Program Implementation (MOSPI) Has been brought under philhal anischitata kii sthitiyah anischitata isliye he kyonki 23 may ko jab puraa desh chunaav nateezon par nigaah jamaaye hue tha, tab endie sarkaar ne sankhyikee vibhaag ke pun rgathan ke liye aadesh paarit kar diya
 According to this order, the National Statistics Office (NSO) and its associated departments like NSSO, CSO etc
 will be part of the Union Ministry of Statistics and Program Implementation (MOSPI)
 eneseso or siesao kaa enesao ke saath vilay kar diya gaya or sachiv str ke adhikari ko kendriya sankhyikee or kaarykram karyanvayan mantralay (emoespiai) ke tahat enesao kaa pramukh bana diya gaya
 This restructuring process is silent on both CSI and NSC
 2007-10 ke bich pehle siesai rahe pranab sen kaa kahana he ki sarkaar ke is aadesh se kuch ashankaayen utpann hui hai
 First, the NSSO, which collects various socio-economic data at the national level, was abolished and made part of the general bureaucracy
 duusare, is aadesh main siesai or enessi ke bare main koi zikr nahin he ki inkaa kaam kya hoga?mohanan kii ashankaendar yah he ki jab siesai or enessi swytt sansthaaen nahin rahengi to sankhyikee system main puri tarah raajnneetik hastkshep rahegaa, jaise ki sarkaar ke duusare vibhaagon main hota he
 With the government order, it seems that only the secretary of the Union Ministry of Statistics and Program Implementation (MOSPI) will replace CSI
 khabaren hai ki sarkaar ise sanvaidhanik darja dene ja rahi he
 If this happens, it will be in the right direction but at the same time it will also have to ensure that this department can remain free from political interference
 enessi main janvari se koi chairman yaa swatantra sadsy nahin he
 The quality of data has long been a question of quality of data
 haal hi main eneseso se kai aise aankade jari hue jinhen lekar vivaad ho chukaa he
 In such a situation, it is important to take care that the quality of data is improved
 enessi apni gunvattta ko badhaane ke liye or sansadhano kii maang kar rahaa he
 But the government has not heeded this demand
 is saal janvari main istipha dete samay mohanan ne aisi samasyaon ko uthaaya tha
 What should be done to reverse this grave situation and restore the credibility of the statistics department? Pranab Sen gives two suggestions for this
 pehla, siesai kii swytta ko behaal kiya jaae or iskaa ek kaaryakari pramukh niyukt ho
 Second, strengthen the NSC which is a part time department with a part time chairman
 kam se kam iske chairman or do sadasyon ko sanvaidhanik darja dekar purnakalik karmchaaree banaaya janaa chahie
 Mohanan says that the responsibilities of NSC should be increased regarding NSSO and CSO
 jidipi, saamaajik kshetra ke aankade or sample survey ko cover karne ke liye ise visheshgy muhaiyaa karaane chahie
 All data related activities should be rationalized so that CSI can only look at statistics
 kul milakar, behatar nitiyon or behatar saamaajik-vikaas ke liye arthvyastha ke bare main or adhik survey, or adhik adhyayanon kii jarurat he
 As SP Chief Mulayam Singh Yadav's promise of not giving up Mainpuri seat was made an issue by his rival parties in Azamgarh, party general secretary Ram Gopal Yadav today said that Mulayam would leave Mainpuri seat after winning elections from both the places

 Mayawati's BSP and Akhilesh Yadav's SP have announced to contest 38-38 seats in the Lok Sabha elections in UP, but it is still unclear how many seats will be given to the ally RLD
 haalanki, RLD or sapa-basapa gathbandhan par aaj aakhri faisla hona he
 RLD vice-president Jayant Chaudhary and SP chief Akhilesh Yadav are scheduled to meet in Lucknow, where suspensions will end from the seats given to RLD
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki baithak ke baad akhilesh yadav or jayant choudhary mayawati se milane bhi jaaenge
 Let me tell you that in the SP-BSP alliance two seats were kept for the RLD
 muzaffarnagar se ajit singh or bagpat se jayant choudhary ke liye do siten rakhi gai hai
 However, if sources are to be believed, RLD is seeking five seats in the alliance, while the SP-BSP alliance is expected to get 2 seats
 RLD ne kairana, mathura or hathras kii bhi siten maangi hai
 But Hathras seat has gone to BSP quota and Mayawati is not ready to give any seat to RLD from her quota
 aise main akhilesh sapa ke cote se mathura seat RLD ko dene ko taiyaar ho gayi hai
 Screw is attached to Kairana's seat
 saidhantik rup se RLD or sapa-basapa ke saath gathbandhan ke liye taiyaar he
 The coalition's formal announcement on this may be announced on Thursday
 bataa den ki upi kii rajdhani lakhanu main sanyukt press conference kar sapa pramukh akhilesh yadav or basapa supremeo mayawati ne siton ke bantwaare par se suspence khatm kar diya or 38-38 siten apane paas rakh leen
 In the press conference, Mayawati announced to contest 38-38 seats in total 80 seats for both the SP and BSP parties, and said that the remaining 2 seats will be left for the allies and the seats of Amethi and Rae Bareli for the Congress
 enditivi ko sutron se mili jaankaree ke mutabik, sapa-basapa gathbandhan main jin do siton ko sahyogiyon ke liye choda gaya he, ve donon siten choudhary ajit singh kii rashtriya lokdal ke khate main jaaengi
 In fact, in the meeting of Mayawati and Akhilesh in Delhi on January 4, the formula for giving RLD two seats was decided
 ye do siten muzaffarnagar or bagpat hai
 Chaudhary Ajit Singh from Muzaffarnagar and Jayant Chaudhary from Baghpat
 magar buudhvaar ko jayant choudhary ne akhilesh yadav se milakar kairana, mathura or hathras kii siten bhi maangi
 RLD candidate Tabbasum Hassan won the by-election with the support of SP on the Kairana seat
 akhilesh ne sapa ke cote se RLD ko do or siten dene kaa bharosa dilaayaa tha, par hathras seat basapa ke cote main pehle hi ja chuki he
 However, the RLD doors at Kairana and Mathura seats have not been closed yet
 do siton par areldi kii ab bhi baat ban sakati he
 If sources are to be believed, while Akhilesh Yadav is ready to give the seat to RLD from his quota, Mayawati is not ready to give a single seat to RLD from her quota
 baharhaal, is maheene kii 15 taarikh ke baad akhilesh or jayant choudhary kii mulaaqaat phir hogi jisamen teble par baith kar pashchimi uttar pradesh main RLD ke saath talmail baitaane par charchaa hogi
 At the same time, SP can also give one seat to Nishad Party and one seat to OP Rajbhar
 sapa nishad party ke sanjay nishad ko sapa ke simbel par chunaav ladayegi
 It is believed that the SP OP is trying to bring Rajbhar along for a big benefit
 aisa mana ja rahaa he ki opi rajbhar mahagathbandhan main aate hai to wo apane saath apane chaar vidhayak bhi laaenge
 In such a situation, with the arrival of four mlas, one Rajya Sabha seat will also be claimed
 aise main rajbhar ko seat dena sapa ke liye faayde kaa sauda he
 OP Rajbhar is currently in alliance with the BJP and is trying to pressure the BJP by demanding more than two seats for himself in the Lok Sabha elections
