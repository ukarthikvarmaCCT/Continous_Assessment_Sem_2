 lekin kisaan yah kar nahin paa rahaa he
 The shortage of urea fertilizer in the country has made it troublesome
 us par behad lachar vitaran pranali or kalabazari is kami ko us mukaam par le jaati he jahaan kisaan yaa to karaah uthta he yaa phir hal kii jagah danda or laathiyaan uthaa letaa he
 The four statements presented above are, in fact, just a small glimpse of the struggle of millions of farmers across North and Central India to get a sack of urea every day

 Since 1990, 13 plants producing urea have been shut down or production has stalled (see chart)

 On one hand, domestic production units closed down, on the other hand urea imports also declined
 lekin sarkaar or companiyon ke liye uria kaa utpaadan badhanaa aasaan nahin he
 Says Satish Chandra, director general of the Fertilizer Association of India, "one of the reasons for the huge increase in demand for urea is that 75 percent subsidy is being given on urea
 12 saal se uria kii keemat takreeban sthir bani hui he
 On the other hand, subsidy on the price of DAP and some other fertilizers is low
 aise main kisaan is taraf aakarshith nahin ho rahaa

 While defense and business agreements are important in these meetings, there is a special reason for meeting President Putin in this visit

 vaise indian medical association ke saath, dilli medical association ne bhi khule aam ye ghoshnaa kar di he ki chunaavon main khadey hone vaale har doctor ko association kii taraf se puraa saport karenge chaahe ve kisi bhi party se khadey hon
 According to Dr
 Narendra Saini, president of the Delhi Medical Association, there are thousands of members of the association in Delhi and everyone is being asked to support the doctors who are going to stand in the elections, either in the meeting or on any other occasion
 unke anusaar doctoron ke liye association raily se lekar ghar-ghar jaakar tikat maangane kaa kaam karegi
 On getting tickets, every doctor associated with the association will play every doctor at every level
 bijepi netaa dow harsh vardhan kaa maananaa he doctor ke saath padhaa-likhaa tabaka bhi vidhansabha pahunch rahaa he, ye acchhee baat he
 According to him, not only the doctors who stand for the election are supported by the doctors, but they also have full hope of getting support from their patients and perhaps this is the reason why the doctors are more likely to win
 lekin ek baat to saaf he ki jitna zyada padhaa-likhaa tabaka vidhansabha pahonchega, utani hi dilli kii tasviir badalegi

 sarkaar ke is faisle ke baad chini milon kaa daawa tha ki use 2 million ton chini niryaat karne kii majaburi ke chalate lagbhag 150 dollar prati ton kaa kaa nuksaan uthaanaa padaa kyonki vaishvik str par chini kii keemten dhai saal ke nichle str par he
 The hanging sword of the WTO? However, after the central government's decision, there is a possibility that rival countries like Brazil, Australia and Thailand may knock the door of the World Trade Organization against India

 Experts claim that the decision will directly benefit the country's sugar industry and it will be easy for them to export sugar to the prescribed limit
 badahaal hai ganna kisanmodi sarkaar kaa daawa he ki ganna kisaanon ko 55 rupee prati quintal kaa bhugtan karne kii yojana se dablutio ke niyamon kaa ulanghan nahin hoga
 Rather, this scheme will improve the economic condition of 5 crore sugarcane farmers in the country
 iske saath hi kendra sarkaar kaa daawa he ki is yojana se godaam main pade chini ke stox kii samasya se jujh rahi 524 chini milon ko bhi raahat pahonchegi
 Read this: Leave doubled, the farmers' income may be reduced by one-fourth due to these reasons, according to the plan of the Central Government, the government will pay 55 rupees in the fixed support price of sugarcane, while the remaining amount will have to be borne by the sugar mills
 gauratlab he ki kendra sarkaar prati varsh chini milon dwaara kisaan ko ganne kaa bhugtan karne kaa dar nirdhaarit karti he lekin ganna utpaadan ke liye sabase pramukh rajya uttar pradesh main kisaanon ko khush karne ke liye keemton main ijapha kar diya jaataa he
 In the financial year 2017-18, the support price of sugarcane was fixed at Rs 255 per 100 kg but the Uttar Pradesh government raised it to Rs 315 per 100 kg

 Sugar mills claim that because of this, they face problems in paying sugarcane to the farmers and a large number of farmers are unable to pay for their crops

 aankadon ke mutabik chini milon par ganna kisaanon kaa abhitak lagbhag 17 hajaar karod rupee bakaayaa he
 According to data from the Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA), Uttar Pradesh is the largest producer of sugarcane in the country
 yahaan sugar mills par ganna kisaanon kaa lagbhag 7200 karod rupee bakaayaa he
 After this, farmers in Maharashtra and Karnataka owe about Rs 5000 crore to sugar mills

 Such was the image of the simplistic, attractive face-piece actor Farukh Sheikh, who looked very self-aware and well known on the silver screen
 aap farrukh shaikh ko yaad karen to kabhi aapke saamne 'chashme baddoor' kaa kirdaar siddharth parashar saamne aa jayega, to kabhi nawabi andaaj main 'umrao jaan' kaa nawab yaa phir kabhi film 'saath-saath' kaa bebas berozegaar yuvak
 Farooq Sheikh was an actor who did not act on screen, but won it
 baroda jile ke nikat 25 march, 1948 ko ek jameendaar parivaar main janme farrukh shaikh paanch bhai bahanon main sabase bade the
 He was educated in Mumbai
 vakil pita ke padchinhon par chalate hue farrukh ne bhi shuruyaat main vakaalat ke peshey ko hi chunaa, lekin unke sapane or unki manzil kahin or hi the
 Unable to find his own identity in advocacy, Farrukh then chose acting as a career
 unhone apane kariyar kii shuruyaat theatre se kii
 He worked with the Bharatiya Jan Natya Sangh (IPTA) and well-known director Sagar Sarhadi
 unhen apane samakaleen abhinaytaon ke samaan superstar kaa darja bhale hi na mila ho, lekin apni mehnat, lagan or jeevant abhinay kshamta ke balboote vah sheeghra hi filmi duniya main apni ek alag chhap chhodane main kaamyaab rahe
 Farukh worked in film as well as TV and theater
 filmon main sakriyata ke baavjood vah rangamanch se bhi jude rahe
 His drama 'tumhari Amrita' with Shabana Azmi was a huge success
 e
 R
 gurni ke 'lav letters' par aadhaarit is naatak main farrukh or shabana ko manch par saath dekhnaa darshakon ke liye ek sukhad anubhuti tha
 The play was staged 300 times successfully
 vah ek aise paripurna kalakaar the, jo abhinay ke har manch or chote-bade har kirdaar ko puri vafadari se nibhaate the
 Farukh was also an actor in male dominated films who had no hesitation in playing a small role in Umrao Jaan centered on actress Rekha
 film ke poster par hi nahin, balki puri film main bhi rekha hi chai thim
 But Farrukh did full justice to his role and left the indelible mark of his character of Nawab Sultan
 isi tarah saal 1973 main 'garam hawa' main farrukh shaikh ne sahaayak bhoomika nibhaai thi
 But despite not having a lead role in the film, he managed to leave a strong impression of his strong acting
 sattar ke dashak main jab bollywood main hinsa va maar-dhaad se bharpoor filmon kaa ek nayaa daur shuru ho rahaa tha or bollywood amitabh bachchan kii 'engri yang main' kii chhavi garh rahaa tha, usee samay farrukh apane sahaj abhinay se sine duniya main apni ek alag pahchaan bana rahe the
 He kept the characters of parallel films like 'katha', 'umrao Jaan', 'saath Saath' and 'gaman' alive on screen
 vah ek aise abhinayta kii chhavi gadhane main kaamyaab rahe, jo behad jatil kirdaaron ko bhi behad sahajata se nibhaane or unhen parde par asal jindagi ke kareeb or vaastavik dikhaane main maahir the
 Farrukh worked with noted directors such as Satyajit Ray, Muzaffar Ali, Hrishikesh Mukherjee, Ketan Mehta and Sai Paranjpe
 'gaman' main ek taxi diver ke rup main jeevika kii talash main uttar pradesh se mumbai jane vaala ek hataash or kunthit pravasi yuvak, 'chashme baddoor' main ek sidhaa-sada or sharmila noujvaan va 'katha' main ek chaalaak or dhoort yuvak vasudev va umrao jaan ke jahin nawab, farrukh kaa nibhaayaa har kirdaar vividh prakaar kii bhoomikaaon ko behad khilandadpan or sahajata se bakhubi nibhaane kii unki kshamta ko pramanit karata he
 Theater, poetry, social work, writing, reading, cooking and feeding were many aspects of his personality and his generosity and loyalty towards every aspect was evident
 apane laajawab abhinay se darshakon ko mantrmugdh karne vaale farrukh shaikh ne filmon kii sankhya kii jagah unki gunvattta par dhyaan diya or yahi kaaran he ki apane chaar dashak ke sine kariyar main unhone lagbhag 40 filmon main hi kaam kiya
 With producer-director Yash Chopra's film 'noori', he also proved his acting ability in commercial films
 behtareen geet-sangeet or abhinay se saji is film kii kamyaabi ne na sirf unhen, balki abhinetri punam dhillon ko bhi star ke rup main sthapit kar diya
 Farrukh, who is expert in creating every character as a part of his personality, is not recognized by his talent, with a very simple, effortless and efficient acting
 nasiruddin shah, om puri jaise samanaantar cinema ke kalakaaron ke samaan hi saamanaantar cinema main apane sahaj abhinay kii chhap chhodane ke baavjood unhen vah mukaam naseeb nahin hua, jo unke daur ke anya kalakaaron ko mila
 Farooq also decorated many TV serials in the late 90s with his best performances, including 'miracle' on Sony channel, 'zee Ministerji' on Star Plus
 enditivi dwaara banaae gaye kaarykram 'jeena isi kaa naam he' main bhi farrukh ne kaam kiya
 He also played the lead role in the Doordarshan serial 'srikanth' based on the famous novel by Sharat Chandra Chattopadhyay
 apni sah-abhinetriyon main dipti naval ke saath unki jodi sabase zyada safal rahi
 The pair of Deepti Naval and Farukh Sheikh were the biggest hits of the seventies
 darshak in donon hi behad saral, sahaj dikhne vaale or behad swaabhaavik abhinay karne vaale kalakaaron main khud apni chhavi dekhte the or unhen saath dekhnaa chaahate the
 Together this hit duo did many films like 'chashme Baddoor', 'rang-birangi', 'saath Saath Saath', 'katha' which were also very successful
 ek antaraal ke baad 'saas, bahu or sensex', 'lahore' or 'club 60' jaisi shandaar filmon ke jariye unhone phir se filmon main apni pari kii shuruyaat kii
 In 'lisan Amaya' he reappeared after 25 years with Deepti Naval
 'lahore' main unke shashakt abhinay ke liye unhen sarvshereshth sahaayak abhinayta ke liye rashtriya puraskaar se nawaja gaya
 The comments dil kaa daura padane ke kaaran 2013 main vah duniya ko alavida kar chale gaye, vah bhi apni dharti se nahin, pardes se
 But his fans will always live in the image of him as an actor who may not have been a superstar, but in terms of acting, a star was quite high
 (is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he
 This is published directly from the Syndicate feed)
 farrukh shaikh ek aise abhinayta rahe jo parde par abhinay nahin karte the, balki use jite the
 Born on March 25, 1948 in a zamindar family near Baroda district, Farrukh Sheikh was the eldest of five siblings
 unki shiksha mumbai main hui thi
 Following in the footsteps of the lawyer's father, Farrukh too initially chose the profession of advocacy, but his dreams and his destination were elsewhere
 vakaalat main khud apni pahchaan na dhundh paae farrukh ne uske baad abhinay ko bataur kariyar chunaa
 He started his career with theater
 vah bhartiya jan natya sangh (ipta) or jane-maane nirdeshak sagar sarahadi ke saath kaam kiya karte the
 He may not have the same superstar status as his contemporary actors, but due to his hard work, dedication and lively acting ability, he soon managed to leave a different mark in the film world
 farrukh ne film ke saath-saath tivi or theatre main bhi kaam kiya
 Despite being active in films, he was also associated with theater
 shabana azmi ke saath unka naatak 'tumhaari amrutha' behad safal rahaa
 a
 aar
 In this drama based on Gurney's 'love Letters', watching Farrukh and Shabana together on stage was a pleasant feeling for the audience
 is naatak kaa 300 baar safal manchan hua
 He was such a perfect performer who played every stage of acting and every character, big and small, with complete loyalty
 purush pradhan filmon ke daur main bhi farrukh aise abhinayta the, jinhen abhinetri rekha par kendrit umrao jaan main ek chota sa kirdaar nibhaane main bhi koi hichkichaahat nahin thi
 Rekha was not only on the film's poster, but also in the entire film
 lekin farrukh ne apni bhoomika ke saath puraa nyaay kiya or nawab sultan ke apane kirdaar kii amit chhap chhod di
 Similarly in the year 1973, Farooq Sheikh played a supporting role in 'garam Hawa'

 He kept the characters of parallel films like 'katha', 'umrao Jaan', 'saath Saath' and 'gaman' alive on screen
 vah ek aise abhinayta kii chhavi gadhane main kaamyaab rahe, jo behad jatil kirdaaron ko bhi behad sahajata se nibhaane or unhen parde par asal jindagi ke kareeb or vaastavik dikhaane main maahir the
 Farrukh worked with noted directors such as Satyajit Ray, Muzaffar Ali, Hrishikesh Mukherjee, Ketan Mehta and Sai Paranjpe
 'gaman' main ek taxi diver ke rup main jeevika kii talash main uttar pradesh se mumbai jane vaala ek hataash or kunthit pravasi yuvak, 'chashme baddoor' main ek sidhaa-sada or sharmila noujvaan va 'katha' main ek chaalaak or dhoort yuvak vasudev va umrao jaan ke jahin nawab, farrukh kaa nibhaayaa har kirdaar vividh prakaar kii bhoomikaaon ko behad khilandadpan or sahajata se bakhubi nibhaane kii unki kshamta ko pramanit karata he
 Theater, poetry, social work, writing, reading, cooking and feeding were many aspects of his personality and his generosity and loyalty towards every aspect was evident
 apane laajawab abhinay se darshakon ko mantrmugdh karne vaale farrukh shaikh ne filmon kii sankhya kii jagah unki gunvattta par dhyaan diya or yahi kaaran he ki apane chaar dashak ke sine kariyar main unhone lagbhag 40 filmon main hi kaam kiya
 With producer-director Yash Chopra's film 'noori', he also proved his acting ability in commercial films
 behtareen geet-sangeet or abhinay se saji is film kii kamyaabi ne na sirf unhen, balki abhinetri punam dhillon ko bhi star ke rup main sthapit kar diya
 Farrukh, who is expert in creating every character as a part of his personality, is not recognized by his talent, with a very simple, effortless and efficient acting
 nasiruddin shah, om puri jaise samanaantar cinema ke kalakaaron ke samaan hi saamanaantar cinema main apane sahaj abhinay kii chhap chhodane ke baavjood unhen vah mukaam naseeb nahin hua, jo unke daur ke anya kalakaaron ko mila
 Farooq also decorated many TV serials in the late 90s with his best performances, including 'miracle' on Sony channel, 'zee Ministerji' on Star Plus
 enditivi dwaara banaae gaye kaarykram 'jeena isi kaa naam he' main bhi farrukh ne kaam kiya
 He also played the lead role in the Doordarshan serial 'srikanth' based on the famous novel by Sharat Chandra Chattopadhyay
 apni sah-abhinetriyon main dipti naval ke saath unki jodi sabase zyada safal rahi
 The pair of Deepti Naval and Farukh Sheikh were the biggest hits of the seventies
 darshak in donon hi behad saral, sahaj dikhne vaale or behad swaabhaavik abhinay karne vaale kalakaaron main khud apni chhavi dekhte the or unhen saath dekhnaa chaahate the
 Together this hit duo did many films like 'chashme Baddoor', 'rang-birangi', 'saath Saath Saath', 'katha' which were also very successful
 ek antaraal ke baad 'saas, bahu or sensex', 'lahore' or 'club 60' jaisi shandaar filmon ke jariye unhone phir se filmon main apni pari kii shuruyaat kii
 In 'lisan Amaya' he reappeared after 25 years with Deepti Naval
 'lahore' main unke shashakt abhinay ke liye unhen sarvshereshth sahaayak abhinayta ke liye rashtriya puraskaar se nawaja gaya
 The comments dil kaa daura padane ke kaaran 2013 main vah duniya ko alavida kar chale gaye, vah bhi apni dharti se nahin, pardes se
 But his fans will always live in the image of him as an actor who may not have been a superstar, but in terms of acting, a star was quite high

 After meeting with BJP President Amit Shah in Delhi, Omprakash Rajbhar, a minister in the Yogi government and President of Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP), agreed
 ab rajbhar bijepi ke rajyasabha ummidavaaron ko apana samarthan denge
 However, there will be a reconciliation in Lucknow on the issues on which there are differences between Rajbhar and Yogi
 darasal rajbhar mangalvaar ko bijepi adhyaksh amit shah se milane dilli pahunche
 a meeting was held between Om Prakash Rajbhar and Amit Shah at the BJP office in Delhi
 ab amit shah is vivaad ko sulajhane ke liye agle maheene 10 taarikh yani 10 april ko lakhanu jaaenge, jahaan wo rajbhar, siem yogi adityanath or upi ke bijepi adhyaksh mahendra nath pandey ke saath milakar masale kaa hal nikaalenge
 It is known that Om Prakash Rajbhar, who has a good reputation in the most backward 'rajbhar' caste, had come to meet BJP National President Amit Shah to remove his grievances
 isse pehle rajbhar ne kaha tha ki wo apni maang ko amit shah ke saamne rakhenge
 If their demands are not met, they will cut their way
 rajbhalpani upeksha kii vajah se mukhyamantri yogi adityanath kii sarkaar se behad naaraaz hai
 Rajbhar is also upset with the public comments made by BJP ministers
 saath hi wo bijepi kii ore se anya rajbhar jati ke netaaon ko di ja rahi tavajjo se bhi khush nahin hai
 Not only is his displeasure, he is also angry with his portfolio in the Cabinet
 rajbhar itane khafa hai ki yogi ke manaae jane ke baad bhi unki naaraazgi khatm nahin hui
 Rajbhar had expressed his displeasure on the day of the Yogi government's anniversary and posed a big dilemma in front of the BJP
 unke bagawati rukh ko dekhte hue yogi sarkaar kii pehali saalagirah kaa jashn bhi feekaa pad gaya tha
 Rajbhar had said that the present UP government is focusing only on temples
 itnaa hi nahin, unhone ye bhi kaha tha ki jin garibon ne vot diya, unako sarkaar tavajjo nahin de rahi he
 Om Prakash Rajbhar, in his rebellious tone and sharpness, said that this government is neglecting the backward and the Dalits
 unhone kaha ki itihaas gavaah he ki jab-jab inaki upeksha hui sarkaron kaa naash hua he
 Resentment visible on this occasion Rajbhar has chosen time before the Rajya Sabha elections to show the importance of his displeasure
 yahi vajah he ki unhone jab rajyasabha chunaav ke bahishkaar or bijepi ko vot na dene kii dhamkee di, to bijepi kaa rashtriya netritv harakat main aayaa
 This election is very special for the BJP, as it had lost badly in the recent by-elections in two seats in UP and now does not want to lose in the Rajya Sabha elections
 rajyasabha chunaav main bijepi ke liye rajbhar kii party kaa samarthan kaaphi ahm he, kyonki uske paas chaar vidhayak hai or itane vidhayakon kii gaiyr-maujuudagi bijepi ke liye nuksaandey sabit ho sakati he

 china ke fahrren ministry spoxperson hua chunaying ne bayaan jari karte hue kaha ki ham ummid karte hai ki yues apni policy ke anukool ilaake main security or sthirataa banaae rakhega
 In my view, Trump is accusing Pakistan of harboring terrorists, but he should also see that Pakistan is also helping to fight terrorism and maintain peace
 bataa den ki trump ne somvaar ko afghanistan or south asia policy ko lekar spasht kiya tha ki pakistan bhi aatankwaad kii maar jhel rahaa he, lekin phir bhi wo aatankwaadiyon ke liye swarg bhi bana hua he
 Stop giving shelter to Pak terrorists in your country

 kashmir main aam logon ke liye 120 dinon se internet band he
 Internet is closed since August 5
 kashmir times kii anuraadhaa bhasin ne das agast ko supreme court se guhaar lagaai thi ki bagaiyr internet ke patrkaar apana mul kaam nahin kar paa rahe hai to unhen chhot milani chahie
 The first hearing on this case was held on 16 August and lasted till the month of November
 bahes puri ho chuki he or faisle kaa intazaar he
 But what are Kashmir journalists doing without the Internet
 ve kaise khabaron kii becoground checking ke liye tathyon kaa pataa laga rahe hai
 This amazing experiment is happening in the world
 neuyarker ko isi par research karnaa chahie ki bagaiyr internet ke akhbaar chap sakate hai
 Internet is closed in Kashmir's newsroom but the government has set up a media facility for journalists
 vah soochna prasaaran vibhaag kaa hi banaaya centre he jo das agast se chal rahaa he
 Journalists have to visit this center when they need internet
 is suvidha centre par ek patrkaar ko 15 minute ke liye internet miltaa he
 The internet works fine
 laal chowk ke nazadik he ye centre
 Most of the media offices are there
 yah suvidha sirf srinagar main he
 Other districts do not have this facility
 agar duusare zile ke patrkaar ko internet kii suvidha chahie to use kai ghante kii yatra karke is centre main aana hoga
 Nazir told that 200-250 journalists come here everyday
 aate hai to internet ke daur main bin internet kaise hota he
 Imagine what happens to journalists who pass the time on Twitter if the internet is shut down in Delhi
 ve time paas karne ke liye kya karenge
 Old Delhi Chhola will go to eat or do comedy in the news room
 nazir kii ek tippanee se ham chaunke ki kashmir ke akhbaar vaaki kin chizon par sampadakeey likh rahe hai agar ve kashmir ko lekar nahin likh rahe hai
 Or even writing, very little
 kashmir ke akhbaar beshak cambodia par sampadakeey likh sakate hai lekin cambodia par likhen or kashmir par na likhen yaa kam likhen to baat samaj nahin aati he
 Greater Kashmir is the largest newspaper
 pehle hamane inaki bevesite check kii
 No editorial has been published from 6 August to 28 November
 kaha ja rahaa he ki yah akhbaar apni print kapi main bhi sampadakeey nahin chhap rahaa tha
 The articles of others are published which are not related to the current situation in Kashmir
 greater kashmir kii website par 2 disambar kaa likhaa sampadakeey mila he
 Health emergency services are lacking
 3 disambar kaa sampadakeey jalwaayu parivartan par he
 There is a line in it that if there is violence in any part of the world, then global politics is affected
 4 disambar kaa drugs par he
 Now these are printed articles of print copy
 first muslim, greatest main da last ritis jaise vishyon par likhe gaye hai
 There are no editorials on anything that criticizes the government
 kashmir kii aam samasyaon ko lekar bhi sampadakeey gaayab hai
 This is the condition of many newspaper editorials
 kashmir par yaa to sampadakeey nahin he yaa phir nahin ke baraabar he
 For example, editorials have been found on the website of Kashmir Times from November 29 to December 2
 chaar sampadakeey main se ek bhi kashmir par nahin he
 But news reports mention other events ranging from internet media closure
 rising kashmir kii website par 20 november se sampadakeey milte hai lekin dhara 370 par nahin he yaa jo badlaav hua he us par nahin he
 The road is on safety, there is an editorial on the winter fire incident in Kashmir
 naukari yaa avaidh nirmaan ko lekar he
 There is a difference between news and editorial
 kisi ko adhyayan karnaa chahie ki 5 agast ke baad se kashmir ke akhabaaron ke sampadakeey kya kehete hai
 Somewhere the songs of the season are not sung
 vaise khabaron main ye haalat nahin he
 The incidents of Kashmir are mentioned in the news
 class main guru nahin or india banegaa vishwa guru
 You only get to know the condition of the college in your city and town, how many students are there and how many teachers are there, then the air of becoming a world guru will be caught
 sawaal sirf dilli kaa nahin he, samastipur or balrampur kaa bhi
 Why colleges are empty of teachers or temporary teachers are named after teachers
 jab rajyon ke vishvavidhyalay khatm ho gaye to desh bhar se chaatr dilli vishvavidhyalay main aane lage
 Is Delhi University also on the same path? agar aapako dilli vishvavidhyalay ke khandhar hone se koi fark nahin padataa to aap maare khushi ke kek kaaten lekin yaad rakhen barbaad gaanv kasbon or mahanagaron ke hi chaatr honge
 The price of which you will pay out of your pocket by paying expensive fees
 acchhee baat he ki edock or guest teacher ab bolne lage hai or permanent unka saath dene lage hai
 There are about 4500 Adhaka teachers in DU
 ab inase kaha ja rahaa he ki aap edaha nahin rahenge ab guest teacher honge
 Today, the Permanente, the Guest and the Adhaka Teacher siege the VC office against this decision of Delhi University
 shikshakon kaa gussa itnaa tha ki shikshak visi karyaalay ke bheetar pahunch gaye
 Acupai VC became office
 aaj pradarshan par jane se pehle shikshakon ne apane chaatro ko ek patr likhaa
 Look at the situation The colleges and channels that run out of Delhi have journalists, editors, and there is no front coverage on the condition of the colleges teachers
 is vishvavidhyalay ke kai diggaj professor channelon ke dibet main gyaan baantate rahete hai lekin unke peeche uniwarsity kii itani haalat kharaab ho gai or media ke liye yah bada sawaal nahin bana
 Probably not even because in such colleges, students from village towns now come to study
 paison waalon ke liye mahange privet kalege ban gaye hai yaa phir jo adhik paise or pratibhashali bachche hai wo videshon kii shandaar uniwarsitiyon kii taraf rukh karne lage hai
 The teachers' anger is not just to remain temporary but also to see the university that they have built with their sweat
 aaj bhi diu ke shikshakon kaa ek level he, unka kamitment he
 The destruction of the entire university in the name of teachers who teach poorly is not good
 dilli uniwarsity main jo hua he use samajhie
 When the Modi government came to Part Two in 2019, it was reported that the vacant seats of the university would be confirmed within six months
 aap internet par search kiijie to kendriya shiksha mantri ramesh nishank pokharial ne 12 july ko loksabhaa main kaha tha ki kendriya uniwarsity main niyuktiyon ko lekar sari kanoonee baadhaaen dur ho gai hai
 In the next six months, all vacant posts will be filled and there will be appointments at the war level
 ramesh pokharial se pehle modi sarkaar part van main march 2017 main prakaash jaavdekar ne loksabhaa main kaha tha ki part time centre sarkaar kii niti nahin he
 We have a permanent job policy
 dilli uniwarsity main jahaan 9000 se adhik edaha cese hai, ham ek saal ke bheetar permanent kar denge
 Something is spoken in Parliament and something else is done in institutions
 do-do maanav sansaadhan mantri loksabhaa main khadey hokar bolte hai ki edaha ko permanent kiya jayega or 28 agast kii taarikh se visi kii chitti aati he jisamen edaha ko guest banane kaa farmaan likhaa hota he
 Its language is amazing
 patr padhakar lagata he ki permanent karne ke liye likhaa gaya he magar yah kah diya gaya he ki 2019-20 main jab pehali baar permanent ke post aaenge un par guest teacher kii niyukti hogi
 The teachers' union says that the guest teacher is a terrible level of exploitation
 diu ke nae niyamon ke mutabik guest teacher ko ek maheene main 33 class lene ke liye kaha jayega magar uski selary 50,000 se adhik nahin hogi
 Earlier, the guest teacher could only take a maximum of 25 classes and received 25000 salary per 1000 rupees
 ab aapako lagegaa ki 50,000 kii gai he to badi baat he lekin is khel ko aise samajhie
 Adhak teacher gets salary equal to assistant professor
 89000
 Although his job is not confirmed, the salary is fine
 ab edaha ko guest karne se 89000 ke badale 50,000 karne padenge
 After all, what has happened that when Vishwa Guru has become a super power in India, then 39000 rupees are being saved by making an Isaac teacher a guest teacher
 yahi nahin guest teacher kii niyukti kaa panel vaisaa hoga jaisaa permanent teacher ke samay hota tha
 When such a large panel will come for the guest teacher, VC will have a representative in it, then why will not the same panel be permanent
 zaahir he permanent nahin karne kii yah alag vyavastha nikaali gai he
 Our colleague Saurabh Shukla spoke to some teachers who have been teaching for months and years, but they have nothing
 non resident indian bhi dhyaan se dekhen ki unke india main mahilaon ko matternity avkaash nahin miltaa he
 The credibility of Delhi University is made up of its teachers
 ab shikshakon ko hi khatm kiya ja rahaa he
 When Adhak goes for an interview for a permanent appointment, all his experiences are counted, but even if the guest experience is ten years of teaching, it will be considered zero
 non resident indian phir se dhyaan den
 Can Delhi University become Columbia or Oxford University in this way? Guest teachers neither have any right nor can join union nor can they vote in teachers union elections
 is baar permanent shikshak bhi edaha shikshakon ke saath aa gaye hai
 Generally, when teachers go on strike, parents and students are misled that they do not make sense by teaching
 isliye hadtaal par jane se pehle shikshakon ne apane chaatro ko patr likhaa he
 On December 4, there has been a big demonstration of students in Gandhinagar, students of Indian Institute of Mass Communication are demonstrating in Delhi and how long will the guest teachers of Madhya Pradesh have to perform? bazaar puunjikaran ke lihaaj se desh kii sheersh 10 companiyon kaa kul bazaar puunjikaran pichley saptaah ghatakar kareeb 10 lakh karod rupee rah gaya

 The dream of Sardar Sarovar Dam built on the Narmada River in Gujarat was dreamed by Sardar Patel, the country's first Home Minister
 jisko amal main laate hue desh ke pratham pradhanmantri pandit jawahar laal nehru ne 5 april, 1961 ko is baandh kii neenv rakhi
 But the statue of Saradar built on this dam has become the cause of farmers' problems
 darasal stachu of unity ke aasapaas boating ke liye indira sagar baandh se choda gaya atirikt pani sardaar sarovar baandh kii ore diawart kar diya gaya he
 Due to which the farmers of famine stricken Kutch have become increasingly difficult
 halaat itane bighad gaye hai ki narmada se pani kii chori ho rahi he or pani ke liye kai jagahon par andolan ho rahe hai
 Sardar's statue was built, but the canal is still built, the statue of Iron Man Sardar Patel, prepared at a cost of 3000 thousand crores on Sardar Sarovar, the second largest dam of unfinished world, was unveiled by Prime Minister Narendra Modi with great pomp on his birthday
 
 lekin is baandh se sinchai ke liye nikalne vaali naharon kaa kaam abhi tak puraa nahin ho paaya
 The state government has already declared the Kutch region as famine-stricken
 lihaaja kuccha main bheeshan jal sankat ke bich pani kii maang ko lekar janata andolit he
 Demonstrations and shutdowns have continued in major cities of Kutch region for the last few days
 gujarat sarkaar dwaara ilaake main pani pahunchane ke tamaam daavon ke bich 'narmada lao, kuccha bachaao' ke binar, poster ke saath bhuj, abdasa, nakhatrana, lakhapat or kandla main pradarshan ho rahe hai
 Actually this problem has also arisen because the construction work of the Narmada canal has not been done ahead of the rapper
 indira sagar kaa pani sardaar sarovar diawartsthaneey logon kaa kahana he ki indira sagar baandh dwaara choda gaya atirikt pani sardaar sarovar baandh main diawart kiye jane se yah sankat aayaa he
 Boating facility has been introduced in Sardar Sarovar to promote 'statue of Unity' tourism
 jiske liye nunatam jal str kaayam rakhana anivaary he
 Apart from this, the Gujarat government is also preparing to build a water aerodrome on the Sardar Sarovar Dam
 bataa den ki water airodram ek prakaar kaa bada jal kshetra hota he, jahaan par si-plane yaa amphybius aircraft utar or ud sakate hai
 This is a favorite project of Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 gujarat chunaav ke dauraan unhone si-plane kaa istemaal sabarmati tat se ambaji mandir tak jane ke liye kiya tha
 Water theft from Narmada canal Meanwhile, incidents of water theft from Narmada canal are coming out in different areas of Gujarat
 jise dekhte hue prashasan ne ab tak 37 logon par exiaar darj kii he
 Deputy Chief Minister Nitin Patel himself gave this information
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki police va prashasan narmada naharon se gaiyrkanoonee rup se pani lene waalon ke khilaaf kadi karrwai kar rahaa he
 It has been ordered to take action against those who have illegally misused water by putting motor in canal or in any other way
 bataa den ki kisaan nahar main motor lagane ko tab majaboor hota he jab nahar main pani kaa str utana na ho ki wo kheton tak pahunch sake
 Amidst these circumstances, the state government's decision to build a water aerodrome on the Sardar Sarovar Dam has served to sprinkle salt on farmers' burns
 kai kisaan sanghathanon ne kaha he ki yadi sarkaar jald koi kadam nahin uthaati he to pani ke liye rajyavyapee andolan hoga
 Significantly, this time the rainfall has also reduced in Gujarat
 jisaki vajah se rabi fasalon kii buvaai pichley varsh kii tulana main 42 fisadi kam hui he
 Rabi crop is completely dependent on irrigation of canals, except during monsoon
 gujarat main is saal 76
 69 percent of the rains were received, while only 26 in Kutch district
 21 fisadi barish hui
 Due to this, there has been a huge shortage of irrigation and drinking water in the Kutch region

 At the same time, the petitions filed in the Supreme Court regarding this order have been asked to withdraw this order as these orders violate the rights
 court ko cinema jaise intertenment jagahon par ye lagu nahin karnaa chahie
 On November 30 last year, the Supreme Court had said in an important interim order related to the national anthem, 'jana Gana Mana', that the national anthem would be played before the film started in all theaters across the country
 supreme court ne yah bhi kaha ki raashtragan bajte samay cinemahol ke parde par rashtriya dhvaj dikhaaya janaa bhi anivaary hoga, tathaa cinemaghar main maujuud sabhi logon ko raashtragan ke sammaan main khadaa hona hoga
 The Supreme Court held that the national anthem is associated with national identity, national unity and constitutional patriotism
 court ke aadesh ke mutabik, dhyaan rakhaa jaae ki kisi bhi vyavsaayik hit main raashtragan kaa istemaal nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Apart from this, the national anthem will not be used to create drama in any kind of activity, and the national anthem will not be sung as Variety Song either
 darasal, shyaam narayan chaukase kii yachika main kaha gaya tha ki kisi bhi vyavsaayik gatividhi ke liye raashtragan ke chalan par roak lagaai jaani chahie, or antertenment sho main drama creat karne ke liye raashtragan ko istemaal na kiya jaae
 The petition also stated that once started the national anthem should be sung to the end, and not stopped in between
 yachika main court se yah aadesh dene kaa aagrah bhi kiya gaya tha ki raashtragan ko aise logon ke bich na gaaya jaae, jo ise nahin samajhate
 Apart from this, changing the tune of the national anthem should not allow singing in any other way
 yachika main kaha gaya ki is tarah ke maamalon main raashtragan niyamon kaa ulanghan he or yah varsh 1971 ke kanoon ke khilaaf he
 Earlier, the Supreme Court, hearing this petition, issued a notice to the Central Government seeking an answer
 tippaniyan The Supreme Court had said that when people respect the national anthem and the national flag, it will inculcate the spirit of patriotism and nationalism in the minds of the people
 supreme court ne kaha ki ye logon kii fundamental duty he ki vah samvidhan kaa aadar karen or uskaa paalan karen or phir sanvaidhanik sansthaanon, raashtragan or rashtriya dhvaj kaa sammaan karen
 The bench of Supreme Court Justice Deepak Mishra also said that it is clear that it is the duty of all citizens to follow the ideals of the Constitution
 adaalat ne kaha tha ki samay kii maang he ki desh ke naagarik mahasoos karen ki vah desh main rahete hai or unki duty he ki vah raashtragan kaa sammaan karen jo ki sanvaidhanik deshbhakti or rashtriyata kaa pratik he
 Freedom in this matter cannot be given in the name of personal thinking
 yaheen kisi vyaktigat soch kii jagah nahin he
 This is not acceptable under the constitutional model
 pichley saal 30 november ko supreme court ne raashtragan, yani 'jan gana man' se jude ek ahm antarim aadesh main kaha tha ki deshbhar ke sabhi cinemagharon main film shuru hone se pehle raashtragan bajegaa
 The Supreme Court also said that it would be mandatory to show the national flag on the screen of the cinema hall while playing the national anthem, and all those present in the cinema hall would have to stand in honor of the national anthem
 supreme court ne kaha ki raashtragan rashtriya pahchaan, rashtriya ekta or sanvaidhanik deshbhakti se judaa he
 According to the court order, it should be kept in mind that the national anthem cannot be used in any commercial interest
 iske alaava kisi bhi tarah kii gatividhi main drama creat karne ke liye bhi raashtragan kaa istemaal nahin hoga, tathaa raashtragan ko vairieti song ke taur par bhi nahin gaaya jayega
 In fact, the petition by Shyam Narayan Chokse said that the practice of the national anthem should be banned for any commercial activity, and that the national anthem should not be used to create drama in entertainment shows
 yachika main yah bhi kaha gaya tha ki ek baar shuru hone par raashtragan ko ant tak gaaya janaa chahie, or bich main band nahin kiya janaa chahie
 The petition also urged the court to order that the national anthem should not be sung among people who do not understand it
 iske atirikt raashtragan kii dhun badalakar kisi or tareeke se gane kii ijazat nahin milani chahie
 The petition said that in such cases the national anthem is in violation of the rules and it is against the 1971 law
 isse pehle, supreme court ne is yachika par sunwaayee karte hue centre sarkaar ko notice jari kar jawaab maanga tha
 The comments supreme court ne kaha tha ki jab log raashtragan or rashtriya dhvaj kaa aadar karenge to isse logon ke man main deshbhakti or rashtrawaad kii bhaavana jagegi
 The Supreme Court said that it is the fundamental duty of these people to respect and follow the constitution and then to honor constitutional institutions, the national anthem and the national flag
 supreme court ke justise deepak mishra kii bench ne ye bhi kaha tha ki ye baat saaf he ki sabhi nagarikon kaa daayitv he ki vah samvidhan ke adarsh ko maane
 The court had said that it is the need of the hour that the citizens of the country feel that they live in the country and their duty is to honor the national anthem which is a symbol of constitutional patriotism and nationality
 vyaktigat soch ke naam par is maamle main aazaadee nahin di ja sakati
 There is no place for personal thinking here
 sanvaidhanik adarsh ke tahat ye sweekaarya nahin he

(2 / 2) — Office of RG (@officeofrg) December 28, 2015 The 45-year-old Congress Vice President had earlier been subjected to criticism for his 'undisclosed' foreign tour
 sansad ke bajet satr ke dauraan aghoshit sthaan par chuttee manaane ke liye jane ko lekar rahul gandhi par bhaajapa ne nishaanaa saadhaa tha
 Raising this issue, the party had raised questions about Rahul's devotion to politics
 chunki rahul, videsh yatraaon ko lekar pradhanmantri narendra modi ko aalochana karte rahe hai, aise main yah bhaajapa ke liye rahul ke khilaaf 'hamalavar' hone kaa nayaa avasar hoga
 Significantly, in September, the Vice President of Congress went abroad to attend a conference, while the BJP alleged that Rahul is on vacation in America
 bhaajapa ne kaha tha ki rahul ko unki party kii ore se 'jabaran chuttee' par bheja gaya he kyonki bihar main congress ke lalu prasad yadav or nitish kumaar jaise sahyogi nahin chaahate ki vah rajya main vidhansabha kaa prachaar karen

 We have edited this paper a little bit, yet some part is moving in this way
 mananeey mukhyamantri mahoday, ham yuvaaon kii kya galati he, jiskaa khamiyaaza yuva pratiyogi jhel rahaa he
 We are talking about the recruitment of Uttar Pradesh Police Computer Operator, whose recruitment came three months after you became the Chief Minister
 jab pariksha hui to sabko ghar se 150 kimi dur centre diya gaya
 We took the exam by asking for money from here and there, we started preparing for typing
 phir chaar maheene baad 29 janvari 2018 ko police board ne bhartee kii sari prakriya hi radd kar di
 Now, what is the fault of the contestant, which she should bear
 pariksha karai vibhaag ne, galatiyaan kii vibhaag ne, phir uttarmala main bhi uttar die galat to vibhaag ko iskaa dand milanaa chahie, pratiyogi kyon jhele
 We filled the examination form for Rs 400
 600 ru pariksha dene jane kaa kiraaya padaa
 Learned typing for three months by giving 1000 rupees per month
 sibar cafe par 2 baar riselt dekhne, form bharne, uttar maala dekhne main 500 ru kharch kiye
 In this way, we spent a total of Rs 2500
 hamaara to paisa bhi gaya or vakt bhi
 These youngsters are really shaken by this sudden decision
 inke sapane tut gaye hai
 How can this be allowed to happen to them
 yahi nahin pichley episod main hamane 12460 beatisi shikshakon kii haalat dikhaai thi, ve bhi tamaam yogyataon ke baad bhi naukari ke liye maare maare phir rahe hai
 Although the issue of unemployment is not important for politics, but employment is not necessary for these youth
 aaj is desh main berojgaaron ne agar duusare berojgaaron se haath milaayaa hota to unki ye haalat na hoti
 Great English anchors would be running after them
 beatisi shikshakon ko khud se poochna chahie ki kya ve computer oparator se hamadardi rakhte hai, kya police seva ke liye baichaiyn yuvaaon ko aatmahatya kar rahe shiksha mitron se hamadardi he
 The answer to this question is that why have you become such a condition of unemployed youth
 central bank aaf india ke liye probeshnari officer kaa imtahaan paas kar chuke 50 jawan rose phone karte hai unki awaz main naukari khushi chali gai he
 The distinction of passing competitive examination is gone
 ve laachaar kii tarah ek ek din gin rahe hai
 Their result came on 1 April 2017, their joining is not known yet
 300 pio bane the
 250 joined in August and then in January
 magar 50 batch gaye hai
 If the joining is not done by 31 March, their score will be canceled
 ho saktaa he ki 31 march tak ho jaae, lekin is tarah kii ashanka main unka jeena kya thik he, kya koi ek letters bhej kar nahin bataa saktaa ki ham aapako itani taarikh tak bulaayenge
 On 2 December 2017, there was a news report from Maharashtra
 new indian express, times aaf india, hindustan times main
 The news was that the Maharashtra government is going to cut its workforce by 30 percent
 itani badi khabar sirf or sirf godi media ke daur main chhip sakati thi
 That is why TV anchors were keeping you entangled in a film
 sab drama tha or aap us drame main fansaae gaye
 Now the anchors will keep you entangled in the news and dreams of middle class tax forgiveness for the next ten days but will not talk about your job
 2 disambar 2017 kii khabar ye thi ki maharashtra sarkaar ke vitt mantralay ne tamaam vibhaagon ko notice bheja he ki ve 30 pratishat katautee ke saath apni yojana sarkaar ko saunpe
 The government is finding it difficult to bear the seventh pay commission
 isliye karmchaariyon kii sankhya kam kii ja rahi he
 Along with the pay commission, jobs are no longer needed due to digitization, computerization and outsourcing
 maharashtra main 19 lakh karmchaaree hai
 Now it will be reduced by 5-6 lakhs
 iske baad bhi sarkaar kahati he ki yah job cat nahin he
 There was no uproar over the 30 percent job reduction
 hamaare naujavaanon kii polytical quality vaaki bahut karaab ho chuki he
 They are excelling only in Hindu Muslim topics
 naukari ke topic par laachaar nazar aate hai
 There is a pattern that get recruited, sell hope for a couple of years, keep confusing the examination and then cancel the examination, till then take the vote
 doosraa pattern yah lag rahaa he ki sarkari padon ko samaapt kiya jaae
 Do young people know all this, when they are blowing millions for coaching, deciding to give up their youth, do they know that recruitment will be less, job will not come out
 29 disambar 2017 ko maharashtra public sarvice kamishan ne maatr 69 padon kii bhartee nikaali he, jabaki aabaadi kitni he maharashtra kii, 9 karod se zyada
 We talked to some youngsters who came to coaching in Delhi, why are they wasting their lives behind the government
 staff salection kamishan ne do-do baar jawaab dekar kaha he ki 28 farvari tak esayssi siechaesel 2015 kii pariksha main jo paas ho chuke hai, unki alag-alag vibhaagon main jwining ho jaaegi
 By the way, the job of joining is from different ministries
 iske baad chaatr thodi der ke liye khush hue or lage vibhaagon ko phone karne
 Electronic Ministry, Department of Revenue, Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Tourism Defense are to be joined everywhere but the matter is stuck
 vaise postal vibhaag se acchhee khabar milti dikh rahi he
 We got a circular from the students, which took some time to confirm
 kisi ne on record to nahin bolaa, lekin do-do post master general ne of record isaki pushti kar di he
 a circular has been issued in the name of Satya Narayan Das, Assistant Director General, Department of Personnel, Postal Department
 This circular says that the appointment of Postal Assistant / Sitting Assistant who were appointed through CHSL 2015 completed the process by 28 February 2018
 Go isamen yah bhi likhaa he ki hamane 12 janvari 2018 ko bheje gaye patr main jwining kii prakriya rokane ke liye kaha tha
 Now the Union Ministry of Personnel has also approved
 isliye jwining kii prakriya ko shuru kar dijie or 28 farvari tak sari prakriya puri kar lee jaae
 It is recommended that this should be done at a rapid pace
 is patr kii taarikh 29 janvari he
 The letter has been sent to all 13 postal circles in India
 agar 28 farvari tak inaki jwining ho jaati he to yah kam badi baat nahin he
 It is a matter of happiness if 5205 youngsters join from 9 days prime time till 28 February
 aap darshakon ke liye zyaada kyonki aapane vahi vaala topic chhodkar naukariyon par hamaari series kaa saath diya he
 If the postal department officials implement this letter verbatim, do not turn back in the middle, they can fill happiness in 5000 lives
 duniya ko bhi lage ki dak vibhaag kii chitthee kabhi let nahin hoti he
 We will not take credit for this, just extend this series of prime time on jobs for two to three months
 esayssi vaale chairman sahab ko thodaa or pareshaan karenge
 By the way, they have done some good work
 kam se kam jawaab to diya bahut se chairamainon ne to mujhe jawaab dene laayak main bhi nahin samajha
 The CAG was also reluctant to join 1000 boys here
 aaj ek noujvaan ne bataaya ki sieji se sakaaratmak jawaab mila he
 1000's dossiers have been reached
 bas jwining kii soochna nahin ai he
 i hope everything happens soon
 jo chaatr jwine karenge wo dahej na len or rishwat na len or hindu muslim na karen
 If you join the problem of unemployed youth other than yourself, then your strength will be understood, the effect will be there, if you see only your own, then there will be no impact
 vaaki hamen khushi ho rahi he ki postal vibhaag 5,205 naujavaanon ko jwining letters de degaa
 From this news, the remaining 15,000 young people can expect, who are waiting for joining letter since August 2017, even after appearing in the merit list
 farvari kaa maheenaa inke jivan main vaaki vasant kii tarah aayega

 On 30 January, youth in Patna demonstrated with a tricolor outside the Bihar Public Service Commission
 iskaa naam astitv bachaao andolan naam rakhaa he
 The students demand that the BPSC improve its working style and complete the examinations on a regular basis
 bipiessi apni parikshaon kii salanaa calendar jari kare taaki sabko pataa rahe ki kab piti hogi, kab mens pariksha hogi or kab riselt nikalegaa
 The secretary of BPSC also talked to these students, but the students are not satisfied yet
 tippaniyan EPFO Employee Pension Fund Organization, npash National Pension Scheme, ESIC, Employee State Insurance Corporation, we have our pension deposited in it when you work
 companiyaan ek hissaa jamaa karti hai or ek hissaa ham jamaa karte hai
 In 2016, the Central Government made a plan, the Prime Minister Employment Promotion Scheme
 jiske tahat tay hua ki agar companiyaan 15,000 tak vetan paane vaale karmchaariyon ko in yojanaon se jodengi to sarkaar companiyon ke hissaa apni taraf se jamaa kar degi
 This created a new figure
 im bengalooru ke professor prafull ghosh or saumy kanti ghosh ne isi data ke aadhaar par daawa kiya ki 6 lakh har maheene naukariyaan paidaa hui hai
 Prime Minister Modi also mentioned this research in an interview given to Zee News
 magar centre for monitering indian iconomi ke mahesh vyas ne unke research ko chunauti de rahe hai
 Mahesh Vyas says the EPF figures do not accurately indicate how many new jobs have been created
 maamla takniki he magar mehnat to kerani padegi samajhane ke liye
 Many times a man's account is opened
 phir jo log state isurance main panjikaran karaate hai wo ipiefo main bhi kara lete hai, isliye aap chaah kar bhi sahi se nahin gin sakate or gin rahe hai to isaki puri prakriya aapako bataani padegi
 Without knowing all this, it was told to the whole world that 7 lakh jobs were created in a month while not being created as Mahesh Vyas says
 achaanak aae is faisle se ye noujvaan vaaki hill gaye hai
 Their dreams are broken
 inke saath aise kaise hone diya ja saktaa he
 Not only this, in the last episode, we had shown the condition of 12460 BTC teachers, they are still dying for their jobs despite all the qualifications
 bhale berojgaare kaa mudda raajnneeti ke liye mahatvapurn nahin he, lekin in naujavaanon ke liye rojgaar bhi zaruri nahin he
 Today, if the unemployed in this country had joined hands with other unemployed people, this situation would not have happened to them
 angrezi ke bade-bade ankar unke peeche bhaag rahe hote
 BTC teachers should ask themselves if they sympathize with the computer operator, do the Bachchan youth for police service have sympathy with the education friends who are committing suicide
 isi sawaal main is baat kaa jawaab he ki aap berojgaar naujavaanon kii aisi haalat kyon ho gai he
 50 young men who have passed the examination of probationary officer for the Central Bank of India call daily, their job has been happy in their voice
 pratiyogi pariksha paas karne kaa gaurav chalaa gaya he
 They are counting one day as helpless
 1 april 2017 ko inkaa riselt aayaa tha, abhi tak inaki jwining kaa pataa nahin
 300 po were made
 pehle agast main or phir is janvari main 250 kii jwining ho gai
 But 50 have survived
 agar 31 march tak jwining nahin hui to unka score radd ho jayega
 It may be till 31st March, but what is the right way to live in such a fear, can no one send a letter and tell that we will call you till such a date
 2 disambar 2017 ko maharashtra se ek khabar chhapi thi
 In New Indian Express, Times of India, Hindustan Times
 khabar thi ki maharashtra sarkaar apane workforce main yani naukariyon main 30 pratishat kii katautee karne ja rahi he
 Such a big news could only be hidden in the era of dock media
 tivi ke ankar isiilie ek film main aapako ulajhaa kar rakhe hue the
 Everything was drama and you were caught in that drama
 ab ankar aapako agle das din tak middle class kii tex maafee kii khabaron or sapanom main ulajhaa kar rakhenge magar aapaki naukari kii baat nahin karenge
 The news of 2 December 2017 was that the Finance Ministry of Maharashtra Government has sent a notice to all the departments to submit their plan to the government with 30 percent deduction
 sarkaar ko saatven vetan ayog kaa bhaar uthaane main mushkilen aa rahi hai
 Therefore, the number of employees is being reduced
 vetan ayog ke saath saath digitigeshan, computarikaran or outsource yani theke par kaam dene ke kaaran naukariyon kii ab zarurat nahin he
 There are 19 lakh employees in Maharashtra
 ab isamen saadhe paanch se chah lakh kami jaaegi
 Even after this, the government says that this job is not cut
 30 pratishat naukari kam ho jaae, is par hangaamaa tak nahin hua
 The political quality of our youth has really deteriorated
 ve sirf hindu muslim topic main excel yani acha pradarshan kar rahe hai
 The topics of the job are helpless
 ek pattern to hua ki bhartee nikaalo, ek do saal ummid becho, imtahaan main uljhaae rakho or phir imtahaan radd kar do, tab tak vot le lo
 The second pattern seems to be to abolish government posts
 kya naujavaanon ko yah sab pataa he, jab ve koching ke liye lakhon phoonk rahe hai, apni javaani jhonkne kaa faisla kar rahe hote hai to kya unhen pataa hota he ki bhartee kam hogi, naukari nahin niklegi
 On 29 December 2017, Maharashtra Public Service Commission has recruited only 69 posts, while the population of Maharashtra is more than 9 crore
 hamane dilli main koching karne aae kuch naujavaanon se baat kii ve sarkari ke peeche kyon jivan barbaad kar rahe hai
 Staff Selection Commission has replied twice, saying that by February 28, those who have passed the SSC CHSL 2015 examination will be joining different departments
 vaise jwining karaane kaa kaam alag-alag mantralayon kaa he
 After this, the students were happy for a while and started calling departments
 electronic mantralay, rajasav vibhaag, krishi mantralay, paryaton raksha mantralaay sab jagah jwining honi he magar maamla atka hua he
 By the way, there seems to be good news from the postal department
 chaatro se hi hamen ek circular mila jise conform karne main thodaa samay lag gaya
 Nobody spoke on record, but two-post master general has confirmed it off record
 postal vibhaag ke carmik vibhaag ke sahaayak mahanideshak satya narayan das ke naam se ek circular jari hua he is circular main kaha gaya he ki postal assistant / sotting assistant jo siechaesel 2015 ke jariye niyukti hue the unki niyukti kii prakriya 28 farvari 2018 tak puri kar lee jaae
 It also states that in a letter sent on 12 January 2018, we had asked to stop the process of joining
 ab kendriya carmik mantralay ne bhi manzuri de di he
 So start the process of joining and complete the process by 28 February
 guzarish kii jaati he ki is par tezi se kaam ho
 The date of this letter is 29 January
 yah patr bharat ke sabhi 13 postal cirkil ko bheja gaya he
 If they join by February 28, then it is no less a big deal
 9 din ke prime time se agar 28 farvari tak 5205 naujavaanon kii jwining ho jaati he to yah khushi kii baat he
 More for you viewers because you have left the same topic and supported our series on jobs
 postal vibhaag ke adhikari agar apane is patr ko shabdash lagu kar den, bich main na mukaren to ve 5000 zidagiyon main khushiyaan bhar sakate hai
 The world should also feel that the letter of the Department of Posts is never late
 ham iskaa shrey nahin lenge bas naukariyon par prime time kii yah series do teen maheene ke liye or badha denge
 The chairman of SSC will bother the sahib a little more
 vaise unhone kuch to acha kaam kar hi diya he
 At least the answer was given by many chairmen, even i did not think man to answer
 sieji bhi anakani kar rahaa tha yahaan 1000 ladakon kii jwining honi he
 Today a young man said that he received a positive response from the CAG
 1000 ke dosier pahunch gaye hai
 Information on bus joining has not been received
 ummid karata hum sab jaldi jaldi hoga
 Students who join should not take dowry and do not take bribe and do not commit Hindu Muslims
 agar aap berojgaar apane alaava duusare naujavaanon kii samasya se judenge to aapaki takat samajhi jaaegi, asar hoga, sirf apana apana dekhenge to asar nahin hoga
 Really we are happy that the Postal Department will give a joining letter to 5,205 youth
 is khabar se baaki 15000 noujvaan aas laga sakate hai jo merit list main aane ke baad bhi agast 2017 se jwining letters kaa intazaar kar rahe hai
 The month of February will come as a spring in their life
 har aati jaati hawa jwining kii chitthee kii kushbu se lipati hogi
 Wishing the youth a huge blessing from India's only zero TRP anchor
 meri tiarapy to zero he hi magar ise dekhne vaale noujvaan is desh ke hero hai
 Allotment has been reported from Bengal Postal Circle
 yah circular ek chaatr ne whats ap ke zarie bheja he
 This list has come out on 31 January only
 india post west bengal cirkil kii site par he
 In which about 386 successful candidates have been allotted to the division
 yah kaam bahut tezi se hua he
 In the list, you can see the name, you can see the roll number and the name of the place where they will be posted
 is list se pataa chalata he ki siechaesel rank 1187 vaali shilalpa vishwaas kii kolkata jipio main posting hui he
 Candidates say that after this, the joining letter will also come soon
 sahaayak nideshak dak seva kaa muhar laga he is list par
 Shilpa, Amit Baranwal, Nitish Kumar, Dia Ghosh, Amber Kumar, Deepshikha Das, Morsalin Rahman, Bablu Koiri, Naeem Ahmed, Ayan Chatji, congratulations to all of you on this list
 30 janvari ko patna main naujavaanon ne bihar public sarvice kamishan ke baahar tirangaa lekar pradarshan kiya
 It is named after the existence of the movement
 chaatro kii maang he ki bipiessi apni kaaryastylee main sudhaar kare or parikshaon ko niyamit samay par puri kare
 The BPSC should release its annual calendar of examinations so that everyone knows when the PT will be held, when the mains exam will take place and when the results will be out
 bipiessi ke sachiv ne in chaatro se baat bhi kii, magar chaatr abhi santusht nahin hai
 The comments ipiefo employi pension fund orgenigeshan, enpiesh neshnal pension skim, iesaisi, employi state insurance korporation, ham aap jab naukari karte hai to isamen hamaara pension jamaa hota he
 Companies deposit a part and we deposit a part
 centre sarkaar ne 2016 main ek yojana banaai pradhanmantri rojgaar protsaahan yojana
 Under which it was decided that if the companies will add up to 15,000 paid employees to these schemes, then the government will deposit the companies' share on their behalf
 isse ek nayaa aankada taiyaar hua
 IIM Bengaluru professors Prafulla Ghosh and Soumya Kanti Ghosh claimed on the basis of this data that 6 lakh jobs were created every month
 pradhanmantri modi ne bhi zee news ko die intervyuu main is research kaa zikr kiya tha
 But Mahesh Vyas of the Center for Monitoring Indian Economy is challenging his research
 mahesh vyas kaa kahana he ipief ke aankade se sahi-sahi nahin pataa chalata he ki kitni nai naukariyaan paidaa hui hai
 The matter is technical but will have to work hard to understand
 kai baar ek aadmi kaa kai khaataa khul jaataa he
 Then those who register in state insurance also get it done in EPFO, so even if you cannot count correctly and wish, then you have to tell the whole process
 yah sab jane bina sari duniya ko bataa diya gaya ki ek maheene main 7 lakh naukariyaan paidaa huin jabaki paidaa nahin huin jaisaa ki mahesh vyas kehete hai
 Their result came on 1 April 2017, their joining is not known yet
 300 pio bane the
 250 joined in August and then in January
 magar 50 batch gaye hai
 If the joining is not done by 31 March, their score will be canceled
 ho saktaa he ki 31 march tak ho jaae, lekin is tarah kii ashanka main unka jeena kya thik he, kya koi ek letters bhej kar nahin bataa saktaa ki ham aapako itani taarikh tak bulaayenge
 On 2 December 2017, there was a news report from Maharashtra
 new indian express, times aaf india, hindustan times main
 The news was that the Maharashtra government is going to cut its workforce by 30 percent
 itani badi khabar sirf or sirf godi media ke daur main chhip sakati thi
 That is why TV anchors were keeping you entangled in a film
 sab drama tha or aap us drame main fansaae gaye
 Now the anchors will keep you entangled in the news and dreams of middle class tax forgiveness for the next ten days but will not talk about your job
 2 disambar 2017 kii khabar ye thi ki maharashtra sarkaar ke vitt mantralay ne tamaam vibhaagon ko notice bheja he ki ve 30 pratishat katautee ke saath apni yojana sarkaar ko saunpe
 The government is finding it difficult to bear the seventh pay commission
 isliye karmchaariyon kii sankhya kam kii ja rahi he
 Along with the pay commission, jobs are no longer needed due to digitization, computerization and outsourcing
 maharashtra main 19 lakh karmchaaree hai
 Now it will be reduced by 5-6 lakhs
 iske baad bhi sarkaar kahati he ki yah job cat nahin he
 There was no uproar over the 30 percent job reduction
 hamaare naujavaanon kii polytical quality vaaki bahut karaab ho chuki he
 They are excelling only in Hindu Muslim topics
 naukari ke topic par laachaar nazar aate hai
 There is a pattern that get recruited, sell hope for a couple of years, keep confusing the examination and then cancel the examination, till then take the vote
 doosraa pattern yah lag rahaa he ki sarkari padon ko samaapt kiya jaae
 Do young people know all this, when they are blowing millions for coaching, deciding to give up their youth, do they know that recruitment will be less, job will not come out
 29 disambar 2017 ko maharashtra public sarvice kamishan ne maatr 69 padon kii bhartee nikaali he, jabaki aabaadi kitni he maharashtra kii, 9 karod se zyada
 We talked to some youngsters who came to coaching in Delhi, why are they wasting their lives behind the government
 staff salection kamishan ne do-do baar jawaab dekar kaha he ki 28 farvari tak esayssi siechaesel 2015 kii pariksha main jo paas ho chuke hai, unki alag-alag vibhaagon main jwining ho jaaegi
 By the way, the job of joining is from different ministries
 iske baad chaatr thodi der ke liye khush hue or lage vibhaagon ko phone karne
 Electronic Ministry, Department of Revenue, Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Tourism Defense are to be joined everywhere but the matter is stuck
 vaise postal vibhaag se acchhee khabar milti dikh rahi he
 We got a circular from the students, which took some time to confirm
 kisi ne on record to nahin bolaa, lekin do-do post master general ne of record isaki pushti kar di he
 a circular has been issued in the name of Satya Narayan Das, Assistant Director General, Department of Personnel, Postal Department
 This circular says that the appointment of Postal Assistant / Sitting Assistant who were appointed through CHSL 2015 completed the process by 28 February 2018
 Go isamen yah bhi likhaa he ki hamane 12 janvari 2018 ko bheje gaye patr main jwining kii prakriya rokane ke liye kaha tha
 Now the Union Ministry of Personnel has also approved
 isliye jwining kii prakriya ko shuru kar dijie or 28 farvari tak sari prakriya puri kar lee jaae
 It is recommended that this should be done at a rapid pace
 is patr kii taarikh 29 janvari he
 The letter has been sent to all 13 postal circles in India
 agar 28 farvari tak inaki jwining ho jaati he to yah kam badi baat nahin he
 It is a matter of happiness if 5205 youngsters join from 9 days prime time till 28 February
 aap darshakon ke liye zyaada kyonki aapane vahi vaala topic chhodkar naukariyon par hamaari series kaa saath diya he
 If the postal department officials implement this letter verbatim, do not turn back in the middle, they can fill happiness in 5000 lives
 duniya ko bhi lage ki dak vibhaag kii chitthee kabhi let nahin hoti he
 We will not take credit for this, just extend this series of prime time on jobs for two to three months
 esayssi vaale chairman sahab ko thodaa or pareshaan karenge
 By the way, they have done some good work
 kam se kam jawaab to diya bahut se chairamainon ne to mujhe jawaab dene laayak main bhi nahin samajha
 The CAG was also reluctant to join 1000 boys here
 aaj ek noujvaan ne bataaya ki sieji se sakaaratmak jawaab mila he
 1000's dossiers have been reached
 bas jwining kii soochna nahin ai he
 i hope everything happens soon
 jo chaatr jwine karenge wo dahej na len or rishwat na len or hindu muslim na karen
 If you join the problem of unemployed youth other than yourself, then your strength will be understood, the effect will be there, if you see only your own, then there will be no impact
 vaaki hamen khushi ho rahi he ki postal vibhaag 5,205 naujavaanon ko jwining letters de degaa
 From this news, the remaining 15,000 young people can expect, who are waiting for joining letter since August 2017, even after appearing in the merit list
 farvari kaa maheenaa inke jivan main vaaki vasant kii tarah aayega

 There is a pattern that get recruited, sell hope for a couple of years, keep confusing the examination and then cancel the examination, till then take the vote
 doosraa pattern yah lag rahaa he ki sarkari padon ko samaapt kiya jaae
 Do young people know all this, when they are blowing millions for coaching, deciding to give up their youth, do they know that recruitment will be less, job will not come out
 29 disambar 2017 ko maharashtra public sarvice kamishan ne maatr 69 padon kii bhartee nikaali he, jabaki aabaadi kitni he maharashtra kii, 9 karod se zyada
 We talked to some youngsters who came to coaching in Delhi, why are they wasting their lives behind the government
 staff salection kamishan ne do-do baar jawaab dekar kaha he ki 28 farvari tak esayssi siechaesel 2015 kii pariksha main jo paas ho chuke hai, unki alag-alag vibhaagon main jwining ho jaaegi
 By the way, the job of joining is from different ministries
 iske baad chaatr thodi der ke liye khush hue or lage vibhaagon ko phone karne
 Electronic Ministry, Department of Revenue, Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Tourism Defense are to be joined everywhere but the matter is stuck
 vaise postal vibhaag se acchhee khabar milti dikh rahi he
 We got a circular from the students, which took some time to confirm
 kisi ne on record to nahin bolaa, lekin do-do post master general ne of record isaki pushti kar di he
 a circular has been issued in the name of Satya Narayan Das, Assistant Director General, Department of Personnel, Postal Department
 This circular says that the appointment of Postal Assistant / Sitting Assistant who were appointed through CHSL 2015 completed the process by 28 February 2018
 Go isamen yah bhi likhaa he ki hamane 12 janvari 2018 ko bheje gaye patr main jwining kii prakriya rokane ke liye kaha tha
 Now the Union Ministry of Personnel has also approved
 isliye jwining kii prakriya ko shuru kar dijie or 28 farvari tak sari prakriya puri kar lee jaae
 It is recommended that this should be done at a rapid pace
 is patr kii taarikh 29 janvari he
 The letter has been sent to all 13 postal circles in India
 agar 28 farvari tak inaki jwining ho jaati he to yah kam badi baat nahin he
 It is a matter of happiness if 5205 youngsters join from 9 days prime time till 28 February
 aap darshakon ke liye zyaada kyonki aapane vahi vaala topic chhodkar naukariyon par hamaari series kaa saath diya he
 If the postal department officials implement this letter verbatim, do not turn back in the middle, they can fill happiness in 5000 lives
 duniya ko bhi lage ki dak vibhaag kii chitthee kabhi let nahin hoti he
 We will not take credit for this, just extend this series of prime time on jobs for two to three months
 esayssi vaale chairman sahab ko thodaa or pareshaan karenge
 By the way, they have done some good work
 kam se kam jawaab to diya bahut se chairamainon ne to mujhe jawaab dene laayak main bhi nahin samajha
 The CAG was also reluctant to join 1000 boys here
 aaj ek noujvaan ne bataaya ki sieji se sakaaratmak jawaab mila he
 1000's dossiers have been reached
 bas jwining kii soochna nahin ai he
 i hope everything happens soon
 jo chaatr jwine karenge wo dahej na len or rishwat na len or hindu muslim na karen
 If you join the problem of unemployed youth other than yourself, then your strength will be understood, the effect will be there, if you see only your own, then there will be no impact

 From this news, the remaining 15,000 young people can expect, who are waiting for joining letter since August 2017, even after appearing in the merit list

 mahesh vyas kaa kahana he ipief ke aankade se sahi-sahi nahin pataa chalata he ki kitni nai naukariyaan paidaa hui hai
 The matter is technical but will have to work hard to understand
 kai baar ek aadmi kaa kai khaataa khul jaataa he
 Then those who register in state insurance also get it done in EPFO, so even if you cannot count correctly and wish, then you have to tell the whole process
 yah sab jane bina sari duniya ko bataa diya gaya ki ek maheene main 7 lakh naukariyaan paidaa huin jabaki paidaa nahin huin jaisaa ki mahesh vyas kehete hai
 EPFO Employee Pension Fund Organization, npash National Pension Scheme, ESIC, Employee State Insurance Corporation, we have our pension deposited in it when you work
 companiyaan ek hissaa jamaa karti hai or ek hissaa ham jamaa karte hai
 In 2016, the Central Government made a plan, the Prime Minister Employment Promotion Scheme
 jiske tahat tay hua ki agar companiyaan 15,000 tak vetan paane vaale karmchaariyon ko in yojanaon se jodengi to sarkaar companiyon ke hissaa apni taraf se jamaa kar degi
 This created a new figure
 im bengalooru ke professor prafull ghosh or saumy kanti ghosh ne isi data ke aadhaar par daawa kiya ki 6 lakh har maheene naukariyaan paidaa hui hai
 Prime Minister Modi also mentioned this research in an interview given to Zee News
 magar centre for monitering indian iconomi ke mahesh vyas ne unke research ko chunauti de rahe hai
 Mahesh Vyas says the EPF figures do not accurately indicate how many new jobs have been created
 maamla takniki he magar mehnat to kerani padegi samajhane ke liye
 Many times a man's account is opened
 phir jo log state isurance main panjikaran karaate hai wo ipiefo main bhi kara lete hai, isliye aap chaah kar bhi sahi se nahin gin sakate or gin rahe hai to isaki puri prakriya aapako bataani padegi
 Without knowing all this, it was told to the whole world that 7 lakh jobs were created in a month while not being created as Mahesh Vyas says
 pradhanmantri modi ne bhi zee news ko die intervyuu main is research kaa zikr kiya tha

 lords main khelaa gaya yah test is maamle main paanchaven sthaan par he
 Between 1911 and 1925 i
e
 14 years, this record was made in four Test matches
 iske overol record main australia or england ke bich khelaa gaya 1921 main melbern test he jisamen 1753 ran bane the
 Then there is the Adelaide Test played between Australia and South Africa in 1911 in which 1646 runs were scored and all 40 wickets fell
 number teen par australia or england ke bich 1925 main khelaa gaya melbern test he jisamen 1,619 ran bane the
 The Sydney Test played in 1924 between these two teams is at number four in which 1,611 runs were scored
 yani kul milakar pichley 90 saalon main pehali baar kisi test main sabhi wicket ke out hone ke saath hi 1,600 ran banane kaa karnama hua
 Even after scoring 500 runs, the team of Testnew Zealand made a mountain of 523 runs in their first innings and still lost the Test
 yah newjiland ke liye nayaa record he
 Despite losing 433 runs, the record of losing is recorded in the name of New Zealand, which he made against Australia in Christchurch in 2005
 saath hi yah test cricket main 14waan mauka he jab kisi team ne kisi ek pari main 500 se adhik ran banaae hon or phir test haar gai ho
 The record in this case is Australia's name
 1894 main england ke hi khilaaf khele gaye sidney test main tab australia ne 586 ran banaae the
 Even in Maharashtra, which has given the highest number of Lok Sabha seats to the country after Uttar Pradesh, the Congress party seems to be failing to form a strong alliance against the BJP
 maharashtra main bijepi-shivasena gathbandhan ke saamne congress or ensipi kaa gathbandhan he, lekin ek teesraa gathjod asaduddin ovaisi or prakaash ambedkar kaa bhi banataa dikh rahaa he jise khaasaa samarthan mil rahaa he
 Experts believe that the owaisi-ambedkar alliance will ultimately cut the dalit-muslim vote of the congress-ncp and bjp-shiv Sena will directly benefit from it
 maharashtra main loksabhaa kii 48 siton main se 3 seat anusuchit janajati or 4 seat anusuchit jati ke liye arakshit hai
 These seats were dominated by the bjp-shiv Sena in the last election and the congress-ncp alliance failed to win a single seat
 maharashtra main 14 fisadi aabaadi dalit or 11 fisadi muslim aabaadi he
 Dalits and Muslims have been the traditional voters of the congress-ncp in the state
 lekin bharip bahujan mahasang ke pramukh prakaash ambedkar or ol india majalis-e-ittehadul muslimin ke mukhiya asaduddin ovaisi ke saath aane se congress-ensipi gathbandhan ke is vot bank main send lag sakati he
 In the last four years, the issue of Maratha Reservation, Kisan Karba Maafi Movement, Adivasi Movement and Bhima Koregaon violence has been prevalent in the state's politics
 in sabake baavjood bijepi panchayat or nikaay chunaavon main dabadabaa barkaraar rakhane main kaamyaab rahi
 It is worth noting that Prakash Ambedkar and Asaduddin Owaisi have held 7 public meetings in Maharashtra so far and while the crowd attending their rallies is making the congress-ncp sleep on one side, the bjp-shiv Sena alliance has a smile on its face
 haalanki andarkhaane prakaash ambedkar kii party se gathbandhan ke daravaaje band nahin hue hai, lekin unki 22 siton kii maang se nahin lagata ki congress-ensipi se unka samjhauta ho paaegaa
 The coming together of Asaduddin Owaisi and Prakash Ambedkar could have a direct impact on the impact of dalit-muslim population in Maharashtra - Akola, Nanded, Aurangabad, Jalna, Solapur, Parbhani, Mumbai South Central, South Mumbai, Amravati Lok Sabha seat
 inamen se nanded seat se purv mukhyamantri ashok chavaan chunaav ladate rahe hai, to vahiin sholapur purv kendriya grahamantri susheel kumaar scindia kaa garh rahaa he, congress ne is baar bhi scindia ko hi tikat diya he
 Along with this, Congress leader Milind Deora has been given ticket from South Mumbai
 ovaisi-ambedkar factor ke alaava raju shetty kii swabhimani shetakaari sanghathan kaa pashchim maharashtra ke jilon main acha prabhaav he
 In the last Lok Sabha election, Raju Shetty aligned with BJP
 is baar congress-ensipi gathbandhan shetty ko apane saath laane kaa prayaas kar rahaa he, lekin uski koshish ab tak naakaam rahi he
 In such a situation, if Shetty also comes with AIMIM and Bharip, the vote of the angry farmers will go to the Third Front
 jiskaa sidhaa phayda bijepi-shivasena gathbandhan ko hi milane kii ummid he
 Asaduddin Owaisi is constantly appealing to Muslims in his meeting that Congress President Rahul Gandhi and his party will call him a vote cutter
 lekin aap (musalmaan) log inke bahekaave main mat aaiega
 Because the best option available to Muslims today is the deprived Bahujan Aghadi coalition of small parties
 ullekhneey he ki asaduddin ovaisi desh main musalamaanon kii durdasha ke liye lagaataar congress ko jimmedaar tehraate rahe hai
 The Sachar Committee and Sri Krishna have been accused of putting the report on hold

 Dr Sunil Dagar, who examined Kejriwal, told IANS that the chief minister is suffering from severe asthma, which has filled his lungs
 isliye unhen puri tarah aaraam karne ko kaha gaya he
 Significantly, Kejriwal sat on a sit-in with supporters to demand the suspension of Delhi Police officials who had ignored their ministers

 ' film kaa naam : das devdiarector: sudhir mishrastar cast: aditi raav hydari, richa chaddha ,saurabh shukla, rahul bhat , vineet singh, vipin sharmivadhi: 2 ghanta 20 minutesrtificate: u / aretimga: 2 starbengal ke upanyaaskarshratchandra chattopadhyaayne lagbhag 100 saal pehle 1917 main romance par aadhaarit ek upanyaas likhaa tha jiskaa naam 'devdas' tha
 Later about 16 films were made in different languages based on this novel
 inamen el sahagal, dilip kumaar, shahrukh khan or abhaya deol jaise kalakaaron ne devdas kaa kirdaar nibhaayaa
 Each time there are 3 important characters in this novel, including Devdas, Paro and Chandramukhi
 abaki baar is upanyaas kii reverse giyar main chalaate hue nirmaataa nirdeshak sudhir mishra ne das dev film banaai he , jisamen dev kii jarney das se dev tak banane kii darshaayi gai he
 Let's know how the film is made, let's review - The story of the story begins in 1997 in Jahana (uttar Pradesh), where the minister Vishambhar Pratap (anurag Kashyap) is seen addressing a political rally and his Son Dev (rahul Bhatt) is quite young and Dev has a good friendship with Paro (richa Chadha)
 kuch ghatnaayen aisi ghatati hai jisaki vajah se dev ko paro or pita se bichhadakar dilli janaa padataa he, jahaan usko nashe kii lat lag jaati he
 Also, she is looked after by Shrikant (dalip Tahil) secretary Chandni (aditi Rao Hydari)
 idhar gaanv main paro bhi badi ho jaati he, dev kaa paro ke prati prem alag he, vahiin is bich dev ke chachaa avadhesh pratap (saurabh shukla) kii maujuudagi bhi kahani ko alag line main le jaati he
 You have to watch the film to know that the movement in the political corridors and the events going on in the life of Dev finally concludes
 sudhir mishra bole- chahat, power or lat kii kahani he 'das dev'kamjor kadifilm or iske saath sudhir mishra kaa naam jud janaa, apane aap main hi utsukata kaa kaaran ban jaataa he, lekin film dekhne ke dauraan aisi koi bhi baat najar nahin aayi, jise dekhakar kaha ja sake kii film kaaphi dilachasp he
 The story is the same old, the way of showing is very weak, especially the characters' journeys and their layering are very weak
 ek hi samay par raajnneeti ke saath saath prem prasang bhi dikhaane kii purajor koshish kii gayi he, lekin na hi raajnneeti kii baaten puri ho pai hai or na hi romance kaa angel aayaa
 There is something during the film, which was making it incomplete
 film main kai kirdaar kaaphi laud hai, jinhen sanvaadon ke aadan-pradaan ke dauraan sun paanaa bahut mushkil ho rahaa tha
 The screenplay is very weak and you miss the superfast local from one scene to another
 vaise to ye mahaj 2 ghante 20 minute kii film he lekin dekhte vakt lag rahaa tha ki ye kitni badi film he
 Das Dev has a film of 'dev' and this character has been seen earlier in the audience playing l Sehgal, Dilip Kumar or Shah Rukh Khan and Abhay Deol and now the role played by Rahul Bhatt seems to have faded
 is
 film ke gane bhi relies se pehle hit nahin ho paae hai 
 The voice of Aditi Rao Hydari as the narrator is used in the film, but that voice is quite slow throughout the film, whose pitch could have been improved further
 vaise film dekhte hue bilkul nahin lagata kii yah 3 baar neshnal award vinar sudhir mishra sahab kii film he, jinhone dharavi, chameli, is raat kii subah nahin, hajaaron khwahishen aisi, ye saali jindagi jaisi bahut hi umdaa filmein banaai hai
 Avengers can earn so much in India on the first day, why do you see the highest-grossing film? Rana and the rest of the characters have acted spontaneously
 film ke samvaad badhiya hai or loketions bhi kamaal kii hai
 Direction and synematography are also good
 saurabh shukla kaa luk bahut badhiya he, haalanki kirdaar or behatar ho saktaa tha 
 The budget of the box office film is said to be around 15 crores and is going to be released in about 650 screens, Avengers Infinity War has also been released this week, now it will be interesting to see how this film will perform at the box office
