 APJ Abdul Kalam passed away on Monday evening after falling while delivering a lecture at IIM
 kalam ke jivan se judi aisi hi kai baaten ek nai kitaab 'ri-ignited : scientific pathauez tu e brieter future' main hai
 The book, written by Kalam and his former scientific advisor, Sreejan Pal Singh, also advises young people to pursue careers in fields such as robotics, aeronautics, neurosciences, pathology, palaeontology and material sciences
 kalam kaa kahana tha ki jab vah yuva the, tab unhen payalat, unke vimaanon kii kahaniyaan acchhee lagati thim
 He was always keen to learn about planes and wanted to become a pilot himself
 unhone likhaa 'mere gaanv main to ginechune log hi vimaanon par charchaa kar sakate the
 My family members were not educated, but i benefited greatly from my teachers
 meri jigyaasa ek shikshak ne shant kii

 He said 'my teacher gave me the purpose of life

 a post by American student Michele Krauska went viral on the internet, in which he wrote an objection
 unhone likhaa tha ki kis tarah bharat main study trip ke dauraan log unhen ghoorte the, unka peechha karte the or yahaan tak ki unka rape karne kii bhi koshish kii gai
 And because of all this, she became a victim of personality disorder
 padhein mishael cross kaa blossob ek or videshi ladki jine ne bharat main apane anubhav ke bare main likhaa he
 The blue-eyed German girl says that her experience in India was completely different from Michelle Cross
 jine kaa anubhav unheen kii jubaani:main ab tak kai baar mishael cross ke bhartiya anubhav ke bare main pard chuki hum
 i am no different from the millions of people who have had this blog
 lekin fark yah he ki main bhi cross kii tarah us khaufnak anubhav se guzar chuki hum kyonki main akele bharat jaati rahati hum
 And yes, i am also white, i am in my 20th year and am a foreign woman
 maine akele bharat ke kai ilaakon kii yatra kii he or pichley do maheenon se dilli main rah rahi hum
 My experience is very positive and exciting and i am overwhelmed by the hospitality of Indians towards me
 mere liye bharat alag kyon he? kya main vaaki main sirf khushkismat hum? yaa main khud ke liye alag bartaav kii chahat main bharat ko alag nazariye se dekhati hum? main yahaan par mishael ke anubhav se apane anubhav kii tulana kar rahi hum taaki main yah samajha sakuun ki main kya kahana chaahati hum
 Do Indian men stare at me? Yes, they do
 
 
 or bhartiya mahilaayein or bachche or europea musafir bhi aisa karte hai
 They look at me with the same curiosity as people from Africa, South America, Eastern and Southern Europe and other Asian countries
 mujhe lagata he ki videsh se aae kisi vyakti ko is tarah se dekhnaa swaabhaavik he
 i took my Eritrean (eritrea, the far east country of the African continent) friend to my grandmother's village in northern Germany
 us ilaake main videshi naa ke baraabar aate hai
 Everyone there stared at him
 jab italy ke purush mujhe ghoorte the to use "ciao Bella"! kah diya jaataa tha
 This method of flirt is welcomed in Macho culture, Italy
 bharat main ise yon shoshan ke rup main dekha jaataa he
 If Italian men stare, they praise and Indian men stare if they sin
 aisa kyon?(aapako bataa den ki italy main jab aap kisi se pehali baar milte hai or usase dostana tareeke se hai yaa by kehete hai to use Ciao kaha jaataa he
 At the same time, seeing a woman means to say Bella is beautiful
 )kya log meri tasviren khinchate hai? haa, ve aisa karte hai
 
 
 But i take even more pictures of them! We Westerners mostly take pictures of every monument, place and people of India without permission
 in tasveeron ko ham apane fasebuk pej or travel blog par post bhi karte hai
 But if an Indian takes a photo of a European, we get irritated and we feel that our privacy is being interfered
 kya phir se yahaan dohare maapdand nahin apanaae ja rahe hai? gori chamadi kaa visheshadhikaar bhuri chamadi waalon ke liye sajaa he?kya saamaajik kaaryakramon main main aakarshan kaa centre rahati hum? haa, main hoti hum
 It is a result of the hospitality of Indians that i got the opportunity to attend five weddings and many festivals
 jab main dance karti thi, dher saare log mere saath dance karnaa chaahate the or kai logon ne mere photo liye or video bhi banaae
 i was the only white woman at those ceremonies and a lot of people had never seen a white woman twitching in Bollywood songs
 mere cese main bhartiya samarohon main mujhe jo tavajjo mili vah kosovo ke ek wedding resepshan ke dauraan mili swaagat or kautuhal se alag nahin tha
 Do i have any negative experiences with Indian men? Yes, the worst experience was when a businessman touched my thigh in an Air India flight while coming from London
 lekin mere sakaaratmak anubhav nakaaratmak se kahin zyada hai
 i just had to deal with people selling goods that didn't leave me
 kai bharatiyon ne mujhe apane ghar aamantrit kiya or garib se garib pariwaron ne mujhe khaanaa khilaayaa
 i had to stay in hotels very rarely because Indians used to ask me to stay in their house and they also arranged for me to stay in their wife's cousin or friend's house
 kai maukon par dhabas ke maalikon or fal bechney waalon ne mujhase yah kehete hue paise nahin liye main bharat kii mehmaan hum
 Can anyone guess my Indian experience? no None
 or to or koi bhi aisa nahin kar saktaa or kisi ko karnaa bhi nahin chahie
 India has one sixth of the world's population
 bharat main dher saare bhartiya hai
 All passengers talk to very few Indians and so they can tell very little about the Indian experience
 lekin meraa maananaa he ki ham apane anubhav khud banaate hai, jaise hamaare anubhav hamen banaate hai
 i know Hindi very well, but when i did not speak, people around me started to greet me immediately after speaking a few words of Hindi and this increased the feeling of security in me
 main aamtaur par khud ko halaat ke hisaab se dhaal leti hum, mujhe andeh kam hota he or main zyada bharosa karti hum
 Like recently i went to Kasauli with an English friend of mine
 hamane kurti or chudiyaan pahanin or is dauraan chaiwale, pandit or duusare bhartiya paryatakon samet kai logon se baatcheet kii or majaak bhi kiya
 My friend's friend urged us to see Kasauli and invited us to the village
 hamane uske parivaar ke saath dinar main lajij daal, sabji or chaaval khaae
 We also saw his family photo album
 mujhe lagata he ki agar bharatiyon ke prati dostana ravaiya apanaaya jaae to har musafir kaa anubhav romaanchak or 'real' hoga
 i am not suggesting that India is a heaven for women
 aapako mujhase rojaanaa hoti chhedchhad, yon shoshan or kanya bhrun hatya jaisi niraashajanak vaaradaaten sunne kii jarurat nahin
 However, my experience in India and the attitude of Indians towards me has been very positive
 mere kai doston kaa anubhav bhi kuch isi tarah kaa rahaa he
 i expect India to treat other foreign travelers in the same way as i have been treated, rather than dealing with Michelle
 jald hi main apni padhai ke liye landan chale jaaoongi
 i will have to spend my life without special care, where there will be no food for the tea house, there will be no chaat papdi, there will be no dance and no pooja on Bollywood songs
 shaayal main vahaan edjust karne se inkaar kar duun or agle saal waapas bharat aa jaaun

 Novelitikasubha Vermaprakashan Sansthan, Delhi-2, Price: 250 Rs
 varisht kathakaar shubha verma ke is upanyaas main kritika jaisi swayamsevi sanstha kii aantarik hulchalon, sanstha se judi sadasyaon kii aapasi khinchataan or vyaktigat irshyaa-dwesh se upajte raag-dwesh or chand lekhikaon kii chhedi gai rachanaatmak muhim banaam nijee mahatvakankshaon kaa sanjaal guntha gaya he
 An institution like Kritika was started to show the way to the Kalamakars so that they can get their complete direction in the world of glory and on the pretext that their literary interests can also be achieved properly, but the importance of the creators and the conflict of interests increased so much that The cherished dreams of the founding members faded
 revati shankar or nima jaisi khaas saheliyon kii andruni hulchale or aapasi vivaad kii deevaaren dhire-dhire moti hoti gayi
 Self-respecting, flamboyant, Dabang Revati's own self-respecting writers used to argue for days
 chunki lekhak hone kii garima sambhraant varg ko aakrisht karti he so ve chhapane-chapaane ko apni puunji main se kuch ansh phenkakar apane ko prabud hone kaa dhong rachati hai
 These women of elite class playing in crores need crutches of resourceless talents to move forward in the corridors of literature
 inhen chahie naam, shoharat or ek lekhak kii haisiyat se milane vaale puraskaar kaa gaurav
 The novel, showing the true nature of these people, becomes a document of the dispute between Kritika vs
 Nina, the president of the institution vs
 the general secretary
 donon apane alag-alag swabhaav, sanskaar, aadaton, maan-abhimaan or manogranthiyon se grast do alag tarah ke paatr hai jinke bich takaraav se upanyaas kii pathneeyata khaasi kshatigrast hui he
 Through long dialogues between women such as Revathi, Surya Adhikari, Namrata, Neema, the story of expansion is repeated because of the monotony of the theme
 dosti banaam kritika sanstha ke padon ko lekar ho rahi aapasi khinchataan main katha kaa ant ho jaataa he
 There are no strong developments or powerful characters in the novel, there is no friction of political, social or family issues, nor any disturbing poignant context, which can be read to elevate one's emotions or derive the narrative rasa
 kritika jaisi sanstha se judi in alpagyaat rachanakaaron kii is choti-si duniya ke uthapatak kaa aakhyaan baanchataa upanyaas dhire-dhire bahupathit darshaniktaa yaa aadhyatmikta kii baton main simtane lagata he
 Repeatedly reading these episodes, the unity of the story or the purpose of the story seems to have been lost from the axis
 striyon kii ye aakraamak bahasein pathakon ke man main atmiyata ke sukh kaa sanchaar nahin kar paatin, na hi kautuhal yaa jigyaasa kaa bhav srujit karne main sakasham hai

 tippaniyan Chatterjee retorted, "he is making such hateful remarks in the greed of power and provoking people

 Despite the efforts being made for the public awareness measures, public awareness, the cases of cheating have not stopped
 police prashasan thagi rokane ke upaay kar rahaa, to thag bhi nae-nae tareeke izaad kar le rahe
 In Uttarakhand, a case of cheating has come up in the name of Shishu Yojana
 police ne kuch hi dinon main dhan dedh guna karne ke naam par thagi karne vaali chitfund company kaa pardaafash karte hue saat logon ko giraftaar kar liya
 This company named Airway Enterprises was making people a victim of fraud by making a card of Shishu Yojana Uttarakhand
 police ne rajdhani ke uma vihaar colony main chhapemari kar saat ko giraftaar karne ke saath hi inke kabje se 46 lakh nakadi, kai farji dastavej baraamad kiye
 Talking to reporters, Dehradun Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Arun Mohan Joshi said that these people were making a victim of the fraud by luring them one and a half times the money back in 15 days
 unhone kaha ki rajdhani main paise ko doguna karne ke naam par thagi ke kai maamle saamne aate hai, jise dekhte hue police lagaataar aise logon or farji companiyon par najar banaae hue he
 It is said that the lure was given to the people by the said company that the money would be started to be refunded in installments from 15 days onwards
 is pralobhan main kai log funs gaye or company ne bholi-bhali janata kii gadhi kamai ke lakhon rupee jamaa kara liye
 Let me tell you that in the past, there have been incidents of cheating by many chit fund companies by luring them to double their sweat and earnings in a short time
 prashasan kii ore se bhi jaagarukta ke kai abhiyaan bhi chalaa chukaa he, lekin phir bhi thag apane mansoobon main kaamyaab ho ja rahe hai

 bhrashtachar ke khilaaf abhiyaan chhedane vaali team anna main ek baar phir daraar najar aane lagi he
 An important member of the team has written a letter to Arvind Kejriwal and sharply questioned him about the manner of leading the movement
 team anna ke sadsy shivendra singh chouhaan ne yah patr likhaa he
 Last week, he had discussed the management of the 'india Against Corruption' page on Facebook while meeting him at the residence of key team member Prashant Bhushan
 gauratlab he ki arvind kejariwal kaa aarope he ki chouhaan loktantr main yakeen nahin karte or unhone soshal media abhiyaan ke sandarbh main ekatarfa faisle liye hai
 Kejriwal also warned that if Chauhan does not follow the decisions of the core committee, he can also be 'removed' from the movement
 apane patr main chouhaan ne likhaa, ‘jabatak aap yah sabit nahin kar dete ki aap is andolan ke aguva hai or maine kabhi bhi andolan ke hiton ke khilaaf kaam kiya he, aap kis adhikaar se mujhe alag kar denge yaa mujh par aarope laga rahe hai? mujhe puraa yakeen he ki asahmati rakhana or swatantra rup se bhi andolan ke hiton ke liye kaam karnaa, andolan ko nuksaan pahunchane vaala nahin ho saktaa
 In this context, there is no response to the message sent to him to know Kejriwal's response
 chouhaan ne apane patr main likhaa, ‘yah bhrashtachar ke khilaaf logon kaa andolan he or ham main se adhiktar log isamen apni marji se shaamil hue, naa ki kisi aupchaarik prakriya ke tahat
 Therefore, the question of expulsion from any group does not arise
 yah ham sabhi kaa andolan he or bhrashtachar ke khilaaf ladaai main kisi kaa ekadhikaar nahin ho saktaa
 He also wrote that members of the core committee were not elected democratically
 saath hi unhone yah bhi kaha ki is saal janvari main kejariwale ne unhen samiti main shaamil karne kii peshkash kii thi, lekin unhone kaha tha ki unhen isaki jarurat nahin he
 Chauhan raised the question 'my question is under which democratic process i was offered to be included in the core committee
 ’ unhone kaha ki loktantric tarika vah hota, jisamen kor samiti ke sadasyon ko chunane ke liye bhi janalokapal ke sadasyon ko chunane jaisaa tarika apanaaya gaya hota
 In a meeting held at Prashant Bhushan's residence, Chauhan also denied the allegations that information related to Anna Hazare was not posted on Facebook page
 unhone bataaya ki hajaare ke maharashtra daure kii jaankaree sabase pehle fasebuk or twitor par hi daali gai
 Police said a case has been registered against the three accused under sections 376, 323, 504, 506, 34 of the Indian Penal Code and sections three and four of the POSCO Act 2012

 upi nikaay chunaav main ek baar phir iviem kii gadabadi ke aarope lage hai
 In Saharanpur, the independent woman candidate did not get a single vote
 rigelt aane par pratyaashee ne iviem par sawaal uthaate hue kaha ki ye kaise sambhav he meraa vot bhi mujhe nahin mila
 At least my family and i had to get votes
 isse pehle bhi kai baar iviem par sawaal uthte rahe hai
 Councilor Shabana, a councilor from ward number 54 of Saharanpur, came to know in the countings that he did not get a single vote on booth numbers 387 and 388
 is par shabana neiviem kii vishwasaniyatapar sawaal uthaae
 He said that at least i and my family have got votes
 aisa kaise sambhav ho saktaa he ki meraa vot bhi mujhe nahin mila
 He said that we hoped that we would get at least 900 votes, but that did not happen
 unhone aarope lagaate hue kaha ki iviem main gadabadi hui he tabhi mujhe booth par ek bhi vot nahin mila
 Earlier there were complaints of EVM disturbances even during voting
 kanpur main voting mashin main gadabadi ko lekar logon ne hangaamaa kiya
 Voters had created a ruckus after complaining of EVM malfunction on ward number 66
 naubasta ke pashupatinagar ilaake main acroshit bheed par kaabo paane ke liye police ko lathicharge karnaa padaa
 According to media reports, voters who came to vote in ward number 58 of Chakeri area of kanpur had created a fierce commotion
 voteronkaa aarope tha kiiviemmen kisi bhi party kaa batan dabaane par vot bijepi ko ja rahaa he
 Like in Hungamakanpur in Meerut, there were complaints of EVM disturbances in Meerut too
 yahaan jakir colony ke ward 85 main booth sankhya 243 kii iviem kharaab ho gai, jiske baad logon kii bheed jamaa hone se maahaul main tanaav paidaa ho gaya
 Here too people had claimed to vote for the same party on pressing any button
 koyala aavanton ko lekar sieji kii report ke baad sansad main jo hangaamaa ho rahaa he usamen asli sawaal kho gaya he
 Which companies are they, whose companies are there and which leaders have interests related to them, who got these blocks of coal
 enditivi kii team ne isaki puri padtaal kii or paaya ki koyale ke saude main sabhi raajnneetik dalon ke haath kaale hai
 This company, named Pushp Steel & Mining, built near Ajmeri Gate, Delhi, made a big journey in a very short time
 ye company 2004 main register hui, sirf ek lakh rupee kii puunji ke saath
 The same day it applied for an iron ore mine in Chhattisgarh
 rajya sarkaar ne use leez de di
 In October 2006, there was a case against it in Chhattisgarh High Court, but in 2007 it was allotted 55 million tons of coal blocks in Madhya Pradesh
 congress kaa aarope he is company ke peeche chhattisgarh ke mukhyamantri raman singh hai
 Chhattisgarh Congress spokesman Shailesh Nath Trivedi said this
 raman singh is aarope se inkaar karte hai
 Conversely, a letter from Motilal Vora is found in favor of this company
 july 2007 kii is chitthee main kaha gaya he, 'agar ye leez di gai to isse chhattisgarh ke durg main rojgaar ke maukey paidaa honge or audyogic vikaas hoga, kanker ke pichde ilaakon kii bhi tarakkee hogi
 This will also benefit the government treasury
 isliye main anurodh karata hum ki is leez ko antim shakl dene ko praathamikta di jaae jisko lekar rajya sarkaar kaaphi pehle apni sifaarish de chuki he
 ' ye maamla dilli hycourt tak pahunchaa jisane pushp steel ko lij dene par hairaani jataai
 The High Court stated, 'it is inconceivable how a company can be thought of giving PL (lease), when the fixed scale suggests that the applicant should have some experience beforehand
 kaise ek company dilli main banane ke kuch hi ghanton ke bheetar chhattisgarh main is tarah aavedan kar sakati he
 ' ab sawaal he ki is company ke peeche kiski takat thi chhattisgarh sarkaar kii yaa congress netaaon kii
 In this case, the company is only stating that it is going to start a plant in Chhattisgarh
 aisi companiyaan or bhi hai jinhen koyala block milane par sawaal uthaae ja sakate hai
 Prakash Industries is also one of these companies
 prakaash industries ko 2003 main chhattisgarh main 34 million ton kaa kol block aavantit kiya gaya
 The CBI raided here after allegations of extracting these coal in the open market
 is company ke maalik veda prakaash agarwal hai jo jai prakaash agarwal ke bhai hai
 Jayaprakash Agarwal has links with BJP and RSS
 jaiprakash agarwal bijepi kii nachuropathy wing ke pramukh hai
 However, in this case, Prakash Industries has said, "jayaprakash Aggarwal of Surya Lighting and Naturopathy Cell of BJP has nothing to do with Prakash Industries and has no business relationship with his brother
 is baat kaa sawaal hi nahin uthta ki company ne bazaar main bechney ke liye atirikt koyala nikaala
 The company is fully cooperating with CBI
 ' The question arises whether Prakash Industries was benefited
 company ne kshamta vistaar kaa daawa karte hue baari maatra main koyala aavanton hasil kiya, lekin company kaa koi vistaar dikhaaya nahin gaya
 Additional coal production was started in 2006–08 and three additional coal blocks were awarded in 2006–08
 kya prakaash industries ne atirikt koyala nikaala? shikaayat ke mutabik, 'pehle nau maheenon main prakaash ne nau lakh ton koyala nikaala
 The next year extracted 1 million tons of coal
 inamen se sirf chaar se paanch lakh ton kaa istemaal hua
 Then where did the rest of the coal go? ab baat escees ispaat or power limited kii
 For this company, Union Minister Subodh Kant Sahai wrote a letter to the Prime Minister
 5 farvari 2008 ko kendriya mantri subodhakant sahay ne pradhanmantri ko chitthee likhi
 He said that the Prime Minister should directly intervene to get SKS two blocks
 pradhanmantri karyaalay ne chitthee koyala mantralay ko bhej di
 a day later, the Ministry of Coal allocated 73 million tonnes of coal block in Chhattisgarh Fatehpur block
 prakaash industries iske khilaaf adaalat chali gai
 It claimed that Subodh Kant Sahai's brother Sudhirkant Sahai represented the company in the screening committee
 ab teesri company kaa zikr
 It is a company called Green Infra, which did not meet the criteria of selection, yet it was given coal
 yahaan bhi saaf dikhaai padataa he ki iske peeche netaaon kii takat he
 This time the Telugu Desam stars are seen outside the congress-bjp
 2008 main green inphra naam kii company ko chhattisgarh main power plant lagane ke liye fatehpur east kol block main nau karod 90 lakh ton koyale kaa aavanton kiya gaya
 Whereas in 2008, it was one of the nine companies that were rejected without knowing that it did not meet the selection criteria
 apni arzi main green ke daftar kaa pataa dilli ke sujan singh park main 201 golf apartment diya hua he, lekin ye makaan telugu desham ke purv saansad or kaarobaari emvivies murti ke naam he
 Now Murthy denies any association with Green Infra
 pataa yah chalaa he ki is company kaa naam badalakar athena inphra projects rakh diya gaya he
 Now its office is in Bhikaji Cama Place
 ab is company ke pramukh alok is mudde par kuch bhi bolne ko taiyaar nahin hai
 He says that he does not know how this company is registered at the home address of the TDP MP
 jab enditivi ne company kii website se jaankaree dhundhani chaahi tab pataa chalaa ki ye company 2003 main bani or iske promotor the karvi financiel services ke sansthaapak−nideshak emes ramakrishna
 His website mentions dozens of projects from Andhra to Arunachal Pradesh and Chhattisgarh
 kya athena ke taar jaganmohan reddy se bhi jude hai? athena ke ek bade afasar ne tasdiq kii he ki 2006 se lekar 2009 tak company ke nideshkon main ek matrix laboratories ke nimmagarhda prasad the jo jaganmohan reddy ke kareebi bataae ja rahe hai
 Whether it is the registered office at the TDP leader's house or the Jaganmohan Reddy corruption case, it is surprising how coal was allocated despite this
 bataa den ki bijepi ne mangalvaar ko maang kii thi ki vivaad main pade koyala aavanton radd kiye jaaen
 On Tuesday, Coal Minister Sriprakash Jaiswal rejected it directly
 koyala aavanton ko lekar sarkaar ghiri he or bijepi hamale par hamale kar rahi he
 Sushma Swaraj said on Tuesday night that the allocation of coal mines should be canceled during this period
 koyala mantri ne enditivi india se baat karte hue ye maang sidhe khaarij kar di
 It has been a well-known explanation of the government that all the allocation has been decided through screening committees in which state governments have also been represented
 bijepi ab ise bhi dikhaava bataa rahi he
 BJP spokesman Prakash Javedkar said that the screening committee was misused
 ye ek mukhauta tha, kol block aavanton ke liye
 
 
 All eyes are now on the companies that have got these licenses
 aglaa sawaal yahi he kya license baantne ke maamle main alag−alag netaaon or dalon ke khilaaf saboot mil rahe hai
 Coal officials are coming to investigate and dispute from officer to minister
 sibiai kaa kahana he ki shuruaati exiaar main bhale kisi ke naam na aae lekin uski jaanch ke daayre main kuch afasar or mantri bhi shaamil hai
 Was not competitive bidding for coal due to former Minister of State for Coal Dasari Narayan Rao? Dasari served as the Minister of State for Coal from 2004 to 2008 and handled the work of allocation
 sibiai us daur ke dastavezon kii jaanch kar rahi he
 Because the CAG report states that on 16 July 2004, Coal Secretary PC Parekh wrote to Dasari Narayan Rao that private companies are benefiting from this allocation
 nilaamee se iskaa kuch hissaa sarkaar ke paas aa saktaa he
 In another note sent on 30 July, the coal secretary said that the current method of allocation cannot be transparent
 20 agast ko koyala mantralay ne kaha ki cabinet main bhejne ke liye ek draft note taiyaar kiya jaae
 On September 11, a note came out from the Prime Minister's Office, stating some deficiencies in the allocation through auction
 25 sitambar ko koyala sachiv ne jawaab diya ki in etraazon main koi dam nahin he
 Finally, on October 4, the Minister of State wrote that the auction path could not be considered any more because it would delay it further
 tippaniyan The CBI is also looking at how the companies which got coal blocks sold it further? Whereas in the market, the mines which were priced at Rs
 2000 were received by these companies at Rs
 100 per tonne
 sibiai ke mutabik sabase zyada gadabadi purvi pattee main hui− khaaskar jharkhand or chhattisgarh ke ilaakon main
 The CBI investigation begins where the CAG report ends
 sieji kah rahi he kol block dene kii niti se nuksaan hua jabaki sibiai yah dekh rahi he ki is niti ke tahat bhi jo license die gaye unamem gadabadi hui he
 Apparently, ministers and officials of state governments may also be implicated in this
 enditivi kii team ne isaki puri padtaal kii or paaya ki koyale ke saude main sabhi raajnneetik dalon ke haath kaale hai

 The next question is whether evidence is being found against different leaders and parties in the matter of distribution of licenses

 The CBI is investigating the documents of that period
 kyonki sieji report bataati he ki 16 july 2004 ko koyala sachiv pisi paarekh ne dasari narayan raav ko likhaa ki is aavanton se nijee companiyon ko bahut faaydaa ho rahaa he
 Some part of it can come to the government through auction

 On 20 August, the Coal Ministry asked that a draft note be prepared for sending to the cabinet

 On 25 September, the coal secretary replied that there would be no merit in these objections

 The comments sibiai ye bhi dekh rahi he ki jin companiyon ko koyale ke block mili unhone ise aage kaise bech diya? jabaki bazaar main jin khadaanon kii qeemat 2000 rupee thi ve in companiyon ko 100 rupee ton ke hisaab se milin
 According to the CBI, the most disturbance occurred in the eastern belt - especially in the areas of Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh
 sieji report jahaan khatm hoti he sibiai kii jaanch vahaan shuru hoti he
 The CAG is saying that the policy of giving coal blocks has caused a loss, while the CBI is seeing that the licenses given under this policy have also gone wrong
 jaahir he isamen rajya sarkaron ke mantri−afasar bhi funs sakate hai
 Now the question is, who was the power behind this company, the Chhattisgarh government or the Congress leaders
 company is maamle main sirf ye bataa rahi he ki chhattisgarh main wo plant shuru karne vaali he
 There are other companies that can be questioned on getting coal blocks
 in companiyon main prakaash industries bhi ek he
 Prakash Industries was allotted a 34 million tonne coal block in 2003 in Chhattisgarh
 ye koyala khule bazaar main nikaalane ke aarope ke baad sibiai ne yahaan chaape maare
 The owner of this company is Ved Prakash Aggarwal who is the brother of Jai Prakash Aggarwal
 jaiprakash agarwal ke bijepi or aresas se link hai
 Jayaprakash Aggarwal heads the Naturopathy Wing of BJP
 haalanki is maamle main prakaash industries ne kaha he, 'surya liting ke jaiprakash agarwal or bijepi kii nachuropathy cell kaa prakaash industries se koi lenaa-dena nahin he or unke bhai se koi kaarobaari sambandh nahin hai
 There is no question that the company extracted additional coal to sell in the market
 company sibiai ke saath puraa sahyog kar rahi he
 ' sawaal uthta he kya prakaash industries ko phayda pahunchaaya gaya
 The company received a large allocation of coal, claiming capacity expansion, but no expansion of the company was shown
 2006−08 main atirikt koyala utpaadan shuru kiya gaya or 2006−08 main teen atirikt koyala block die gaye
 Did Prakash Ind extract additional coal? According to the complaint, 'prakash extracted nine lakh tonnes of coal in the first nine months
 agle saal 10 lakh ton koyala nikaala
 Of these, only four to five lakh tons were used
 phir baaki koyala kahaan gaya? Now talk of SKS Ispat and Power Limited
 is company ke liye sidhe kendriya mantri subodhakant sahay ne pradhanmantri ko chitthee likhi
 On 5 February 2008, Union Minister Subodh Kant Sahai wrote a letter to the Prime Minister
 unhone kaha ki pradhanmantri escees ko do block dilaane ke liye sidhe dakhal den
 The Prime Minister's Office sent the letter to the Ministry of Coal
 ek din baad koyala mantralay ne chhattisgarh fatehpur block main 73 million ton kol block use aavantit kar diya
 Prakash Industries went to court against this
 isamen daawa kiya ki subodhakant sahay ke bhai sudhirkant sahay ne screening kamity main company kii numaaindgi kii
 Now the third company is mentioned
 ye green inphra naam kii company he jo chayan ke paimaanon par khari nahin utari phir bhi ise koyala diya gaya
 Here also it is clear that the leaders have the strength behind it
 is baar congress−bijepi se baahar telugu desham ke taar dikh rahe hai
 In 2008, a company named Green Infra was allocated 990 million tonnes of coal in the Fatehpur East coal block to set up a power plant in Chhattisgarh
 jabaki 2008 main yah un nau companiyon se ek thi jise is bina par kaarij kar diya gaya tha ki yah chayan ke paimaanon par puure nahin utari
 In his petition, Green's office has been given 201 golf apartments in Delhi's Sujan Singh Park, but the house is in the name of former Telugu Desam MP and businessman MVVS Murthy
 ab murti green inphra ke saath kisi bhi sambandh se inkaar karte hai
 It is learned that the name of this company has been changed to Athena Infra Projects
 ab iskaa daftar bhikaaji kama place main he
 Now Alok, the head of this company, is not ready to speak anything on this issue
 unka yah kahana he ki unhen nahin maaloom ki aakhir yah company tidipi ke saansad ke ghar ke pate par kaise panjikrut he
 When NDTV sought to find information from the company's website, it was revealed that the company was formed in 2003 and its promoter was MS Ramakrishna, founder-director of Karvy Financial Services
 uski website par andhra se lekar arunachal pradesh or chhattisgarh tak darjanon pariyojnaon kaa zikr he

 The next question is whether evidence is being found against different leaders and parties in the matter of distribution of licenses

 Prakash Industries is also one of these companies
 prakaash industries ko 2003 main chhattisgarh main 34 million ton kaa kol block aavantit kiya gaya
 The CBI raided here after allegations of extracting these coal in the open market
 is company ke maalik veda prakaash agarwal hai jo jai prakaash agarwal ke bhai hai
 Jayaprakash Agarwal has links with BJP and RSS
 jaiprakash agarwal bijepi kii nachuropathy wing ke pramukh hai
 However, in this case, Prakash Industries has said, "jayaprakash Aggarwal of Surya Lighting and Naturopathy Cell of BJP has nothing to do with Prakash Industries and has no business relationship with his brother
 is baat kaa sawaal hi nahin uthta ki company ne bazaar main bechney ke liye atirikt koyala nikaala
 The company is fully cooperating with CBI
 ' The question arises whether Prakash Industries was benefited
 company ne kshamta vistaar kaa daawa karte hue baari maatra main koyala aavanton hasil kiya, lekin company kaa koi vistaar dikhaaya nahin gaya
 Additional coal production was started in 2006–08 and three additional coal blocks were awarded in 2006–08
 kya prakaash industries ne atirikt koyala nikaala? shikaayat ke mutabik, 'pehle nau maheenon main prakaash ne nau lakh ton koyala nikaala
 The next year extracted 1 million tons of coal
 inamen se sirf chaar se paanch lakh ton kaa istemaal hua
 Then where did the rest of the coal go? ab baat escees ispaat or power limited kii
 For this company, Union Minister Subodh Kant Sahai wrote a letter to the Prime Minister
 5 farvari 2008 ko kendriya mantri subodhakant sahay ne pradhanmantri ko chitthee likhi
 He said that the Prime Minister should directly intervene to get SKS two blocks
 pradhanmantri karyaalay ne chitthee koyala mantralay ko bhej di
 a day later, the Ministry of Coal allocated 73 million tonnes of coal block in Chhattisgarh Fatehpur block
 prakaash industries iske khilaaf adaalat chali gai
 It claimed that Subodh Kant Sahai's brother Sudhirkant Sahai represented the company in the screening committee
 ab teesri company kaa zikr
 It is a company called Green Infra, which did not meet the criteria of selection, yet it was given coal
 yahaan bhi saaf dikhaai padataa he ki iske peeche netaaon kii takat he
 This time the Telugu Desam stars are seen outside the congress-bjp
 2008 main green inphra naam kii company ko chhattisgarh main power plant lagane ke liye fatehpur east kol block main nau karod 90 lakh ton koyale kaa aavanton kiya gaya
 Whereas in 2008, it was one of the nine companies that were rejected without knowing that it did not meet the selection criteria
 apni arzi main green ke daftar kaa pataa dilli ke sujan singh park main 201 golf apartment diya hua he, lekin ye makaan telugu desham ke purv saansad or kaarobaari emvivies murti ke naam he
 Now Murthy denies any association with Green Infra
 pataa yah chalaa he ki is company kaa naam badalakar athena inphra projects rakh diya gaya he
 Now its office is in Bhikaji Cama Place
 ab is company ke pramukh alok is mudde par kuch bhi bolne ko taiyaar nahin hai
 He says that he does not know how this company is registered at the home address of the TDP MP
 jab enditivi ne company kii website se jaankaree dhundhani chaahi tab pataa chalaa ki ye company 2003 main bani or iske promotor the karvi financiel services ke sansthaapak−nideshak emes ramakrishna
 His website mentions dozens of projects from Andhra to Arunachal Pradesh and Chhattisgarh
 kya athena ke taar jaganmohan reddy se bhi jude hai? athena ke ek bade afasar ne tasdiq kii he ki 2006 se lekar 2009 tak company ke nideshkon main ek matrix laboratories ke nimmagarhda prasad the jo jaganmohan reddy ke kareebi bataae ja rahe hai
 Whether it is the registered office at the TDP leader's house or the Jaganmohan Reddy corruption case, it is surprising how coal was allocated despite this
 bataa den ki bijepi ne mangalvaar ko maang kii thi ki vivaad main pade koyala aavanton radd kiye jaaen
 On Tuesday, Coal Minister Sriprakash Jaiswal rejected it directly
 koyala aavanton ko lekar sarkaar ghiri he or bijepi hamale par hamale kar rahi he
 Sushma Swaraj said on Tuesday night that the allocation of coal mines should be canceled during this period
 koyala mantri ne enditivi india se baat karte hue ye maang sidhe khaarij kar di
 It has been a well-known explanation of the government that all the allocation has been decided through screening committees in which state governments have also been represented
 bijepi ab ise bhi dikhaava bataa rahi he
 BJP spokesman Prakash Javedkar said that the screening committee was misused
 ye ek mukhauta tha, kol block aavanton ke liye
 
 
 All eyes are now on the companies that have got these licenses
 aglaa sawaal yahi he kya license baantne ke maamle main alag−alag netaaon or dalon ke khilaaf saboot mil rahe hai
 Coal officials are coming to investigate and dispute from officer to minister
 sibiai kaa kahana he ki shuruaati exiaar main bhale kisi ke naam na aae lekin uski jaanch ke daayre main kuch afasar or mantri bhi shaamil hai
 Was not competitive bidding for coal due to former Minister of State for Coal Dasari Narayan Rao? Dasari served as the Minister of State for Coal from 2004 to 2008 and handled the work of allocation
 sibiai us daur ke dastavezon kii jaanch kar rahi he
 Because the CAG report states that on 16 July 2004, Coal Secretary PC Parekh wrote to Dasari Narayan Rao that private companies are benefiting from this allocation
 nilaamee se iskaa kuch hissaa sarkaar ke paas aa saktaa he
 In another note sent on 30 July, the coal secretary said that the current method of allocation cannot be transparent
 20 agast ko koyala mantralay ne kaha ki cabinet main bhejne ke liye ek draft note taiyaar kiya jaae
 On September 11, a note came out from the Prime Minister's Office, stating some deficiencies in the allocation through auction
 25 sitambar ko koyala sachiv ne jawaab diya ki in etraazon main koi dam nahin he
 Finally, on October 4, the Minister of State wrote that the auction path could not be considered any more because it would delay it further
 tippaniyan The CBI is also looking at how the companies which got coal blocks sold it further? Whereas in the market, the mines which were priced at Rs
 2000 were received by these companies at Rs
 100 per tonne
 sibiai ke mutabik sabase zyada gadabadi purvi pattee main hui− khaaskar jharkhand or chhattisgarh ke ilaakon main
 The CBI investigation begins where the CAG report ends
 sieji kah rahi he kol block dene kii niti se nuksaan hua jabaki sibiai yah dekh rahi he ki is niti ke tahat bhi jo license die gaye unamem gadabadi hui he
 Apparently, ministers and officials of state governments may also be implicated in this
 haalanki is maamle main prakaash industries ne kaha he, 'surya liting ke jaiprakash agarwal or bijepi kii nachuropathy cell kaa prakaash industries se koi lenaa-dena nahin he or unke bhai se koi kaarobaari sambandh nahin hai

 Congress President Rahul Gandhi has increased the stature of former Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot in national politics
 janardan dvivedi kii jagah unako sanghathan mahasachiv kii ahm jimmedaari di gai, lekin gahalot ke samarthakon ko is baat ko lekar niraashaa hui ki 2019 ke lihaaj se gahalot ko dilli main kendriya sanghathan main jagah mil gai, lekin ab wo rajasthan siem kii kursi se dur ho gaye
 On this issue, Ashok Gehlotne bluntly said that some confusing news has come in the media
 koi kabhi mujhe gujarat bhejtaa he to koi rajyasabha bhejtaa he or ab dilli bhej diya gaya he
 He said that wherever i go in the villages, chaupalas, dhanis of Rajasthan, i am getting immense love and blessings of the public
 janata kaa itnaa pyaar paakar main rajasthan kii pyaari bhashaa main vahaan kii janata se yahi kahkar aayaa hum ki 'main tharasun dur nahin' yani main aapse dur nahin
 Ashok Gehlot said that i resolved to serve the people of Rajasthan till the last breath
 40 saal se mujhe rajasthan kii janata kaa pyaar mila he, usase main abhibhoot hum
 Anyway, Delhi is not far from Rajasthan, so do not spread confusion about Rajasthan
 rajasthan main bhale hi rahul gandhi ne kisi ko siem ummidavaar ghoshit nahin karne kaa elaan kiya ho, lekin pehle gujarat kaa prabharee, phir sanghathan mahasachiv kii badi jimmedaari milane ke baad kayaas lagaaye gaye ki issesachin payalataka rasta saaf ho gaya he
 Describing all these news as misleading, Ashok Gehlot himself said that Rahul Gandhi has said that leaders in every state should work in unison
 sachin payalat kaa naam liye bagaiyr gahalot ne kaha ki seniors or juniurs kii line khinchi hui he
 He said that juniors should draw a big line from the long line already drawn by seniors
 isseparty ko bhi phaaydahoga or unako bhi
 But if there is an attempt to cut the line already drawn, then the party will also suffer and their own
 kul milakar ashok gahalot ne taaja bayaan dekar apane samarthakon ke saath hi siyaasi galiyaaron ko sidhaa sandesh diya he ki wo siem kii gaddi kii daud main bane rahanaa chaahate hai or kisi keemat par peeche hatane vaale nahin hai

 It is really amazing for a girl to live and live like this
 ghar main thi ye
 When a bomb from the sky made the same house a grave
 kabr main tabdeel ghar ke andar ab ye der tak ghutati rahi
 Kneeling and weeping
 tabhi kuch logon ke kaanon main is bacchee ke rone kii awaz padi
 After this there was charisma and life came out safely in the clutches of death
 20 farvari, 2017damishq, syris or virdohi guton ko sabak sikhaane ke liye shahar ke upar din-raat udaan bharte fiter jetts yahaan kab, kahaan or kiske sir par bam barasaa den ye koi nahin jaanata
 The biggest difficulty is that the bombs do not know how to distinguish innocent and criminals
 aise main bambaari se zameendos ek makaan ke malbe se logon ko kisi bacchee ke rone kii awaz sunai detii he
 To hear such a voice from under the rubble of hundreds of tons of brick, concrete and saris is nothing short of a miracle in itself
 lihaaza, log cegaiyr der kiye us maasoom awaz kaa peechha karnaa shuru kar dete hai
 This sound is sometimes loud and sometimes stops at all
 lekin yahaan sawaal ek zindagi kaa he, lihaaza log der nahin karte or khudaai karte hai
 The truth is that from the top it is also very difficult to guess exactly where exactly that girl can be in the pile of debris
 lekin phir koshish jari rahati he
 Several pairs of hands simultaneously remove sand and clay as well as heavy pieces of concrete
 tabhi thik ek minute or chalis second ke baad ek doosraa karishma hota he
 For the first time, under the rubble, a girl's little children are seen with their hands and feet
 bacchee bai karavat padi he or dhul-mitti ke bich is kadar fansi he ki uske liye hilanaa-dulana to dur saans bhi lenaa mushkil he
 But it is probably the will of the above that despite being trapped in such a difficult situation, the cry of his cry was heard from outside the people
 ab khudaai or tej ho jaati he or phir dekhte hi dekhte bacchee kaa puraa jism nazar aane lagata he
 But in this situation, pulling him out fast can also hurt him further
 lihaaza, pehle ek rescue varkar uske munh main haath daal kar mitti baahar nikaalata he, jisase wo khul kar saans le sake
 Then first its feet are freed slowly
 tab puri kii puri bacchee bilkul sahi-salaamat nikaal lee jaati he
 However, the eyes, nose, mouth, ears of the girl trapped in the case have filled the dust everywhere
 malbe se baahar nikaalte hi rahtakarmi use god main uthaa lete hai
 With this, people start thanking the uplifting in the joy of saving the girl's life
 isoparationako chand minuton main puraa kar liya jaataa he

 The culprit is just the culprit
 is bich main dharm ko nahin laana chahie
 " ek khaas samudaay ko adhik tavajjo dene ke aarope kaa khandan karte hue mamata ne kaha, "kuch logon kaa aarope he ki main hinduon ke liye kaam nahin karti hum
 They should keep their eyes and ears open
 main sabake liye kaam karti hum
 This is my constitutional duty
 " He continued, "there is no place for violence in a democracy

 hai court ne kanth kii is daleel ko bhi thukraa diya tha ki unhen clin chit dene vaali sibiai kii maamla band karne kii report asweekaar karke nichali adaalat ne galati kii he
 The High Court rejected the argument made by the former IPS officer that he could not be prosecuted in the case of allowing additional seats in the gift cinema as the investigating agency has not obtained approval for the same
 hai court ne kaha ki agar vah nichali adaalat main yah sawaal uthaayenge to vahiin par is masale par vichaar kiya ja saktaa he
 The High Court also rejected Kanth's plea that the lower court had erred by rejecting the CBI case closure report giving him a clean chit

 However, it is also disappointing that this year Shivling's size is much less than previous years
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki yah ab tak kaa sabase kam aakaar kaa shivlinga he
 According to environmental scientist Shakeel Ramshu, this reason for the reduction in the size of Shivalinga is global warming
 darasal is baar ghati main taapmaana ausat se zyada rahaa

 Police has started Operation Romeo Free Drive to protect women in the cyber city Gurgaon adjacent to Delhi
 isamen gudgaanv police kii mahila pulicekarmiyon ko sade kapadon main kisi aisi jagah par khadaa kar diya jaataa he jahaan manachale akasar mahilaon ke saath chhedhkhani karte hai
 The drive was carried out on Saturday night on MG Road, Gurgaon

 After catching all these manacles were taken to Majnughar
 darasalgudagaanv pulicene majanu ghar us kamare kaa naam rakhaa he jahaan in road said romeoj ko band kiya jaataa he
 The Gurgaon Police has also detained 6 girls outside a mall on charges of straying with these mongrels
 police ke aalaa adhikario kii maane to sahaara mal ke baahar akasar ladakiyon ormahilaon ke saath chhedhkhaniki kaaphi shikayate aati thim isliye gudgaanv police ne ye drive dobaaraa isi jagah par chalaai
 But it is surprising that even though the Gurgaon Police has made a Majnu house for the Majnu, but the number of these Majnuo is not being named
 kyonki isse pehle bhi gudgaanv police ne isi mal ke baahar kai baar oparation majanu chalaaya he lekin phir bhi manchalon kii taadaad lagaataar badhati ja rahi he
 In such a situation, it has to be seen how much effect this time has on the people who have been taught a lesson by the police
 26 sitambar ko bhigudagaanv main police ne oparation romyoke tahat chaar ghante main 66 road said romeo ko pakadaa tha
 Along with these misdeeds, the Gurgaon Police had also detained 18 girls who were committing drunkenness outside a mall
 kya aap yakeen karenge ki ek prantiy bhashaai (riginal) film ne bollywood kii diggaj filmein 'bajirao mastaani' or 'airlift' ko kamai ke maamle main na keval takkar di he balki peeche chhod diya he
 That is why it is said that nothing is sure in the film world
 filmi duniya kii yahi khubasurat hakeekat he ki kab koun arsh se farsh par aa jaae kuch kaha nahin ja saktaa
 Many times, a film made with hundreds of crores of rupees gets out of the box office earning race with earning a few lakhs
 udhar, kai baar aisa bhi hota he ki jab koi ek film jiske bare main zyada charchaa tak nahin hoti he vah kamai ke maamle main record bana leti he
 Some unintentional artists succeed in making their own special place in the acting world and become stars
 ye yakeen karnaa kuch mushkil he ki ek prantiy bhashaai film ne bollywood kii badi filmon 'airlift' or 'bajirao mastaani' ko kamai ke maamle main peeche chhod diya he
 This is a successful Punjabi film

 Both of these Bollywood films earned hugely at the box office
 keval 'lav punjab' film hi nahin, pichley hafte relies hui punjabi film 'aradaas' bhi australia main 'airlift' kii kamai se behatar parinaam de rahi he

 @rentrak - taranadarsh (@taran_adarsh) March 14, 2016 ek or twit main taran kehete hai ki punjab film 'aradaas' ne euke main khaasi kamai kii he
 Let me tell you that the film released last year 'bajirao Mastani' made a slow start in the box office collection in the first week, but later the film gained a lot of revenue
 puri duniya main film ne 360 karod rupee kamaaye the
 The film featured Deepika Padukone and Priyanka Chopra in a stunning character alongside Ranveer Singh
 isi tarah akshay kumaar kii film 'airlift' ne videshi kamai milakar 215 karod rupee kii kamai kii thi
 It is the beautiful reality of the film world that when someone comes to the floor with haste, nothing can be said
 kai baar saikadon karod rupee lagaakar banaai gai film kuch lakh kamaane ke saath hi box offis main kamai kii res se baahar ho jaati he
 On the other hand, there are many times that when there is not much discussion about a film, it makes a record in terms of earning
 kuch anjaane kalakaar acting kii duniya main apni khaas jagah banane ke kaamyaab ho jate hai or sitare ban jate hai
 It is difficult to believe that a provincial linguistic film has overtaken the Bollywood big films 'airlift' and 'bajirao Mastani' in terms of revenue
 ye kaamyaab punjabi film he
 Its name is 'love Punjab'
 is punjabi film ke star hai amarinder gil or sargun mehta
 The film far outpaced the Akshay Kumar starrer film 'airlift' and Ranveer Singh with Deepika Padukone and Priyanka Chopra starrer film 'bajirao Mastani' in box office collections in Australia and New Zealand
 bollywood kii in donon filmon ne box offis par joardaar kamai kii thi
 Not only the 'love Punjab' film, the Punjabi film 'ardas' released last week is also giving better results than the earnings of 'airlift' in Australia

 All this has been told by the film critique and film trade expert Taran Adarsh through his tweet

 After meeting Kejriwal, Delhi Congress Working President Aaron Yusuf said, 'we have told the Chief Minister that the way the fix charge was increased and his minister says that we were not able to take this fix charge back because the election conduct Samhita was engaged
 meraa aam aadmi party sarkaar se yah sawaal he ki agar aachaar samhita lagi hui thi to vah to abhi kuch samay kii hi thi jabaki fiks charge to beete 1 saal se vasuul kiya ja rahaa he
 According to Aaron Yusuf, if the government does not listen to them, then the Congress will perform on the streets
 jabaki aam aadmi party kii dilli sarkaar kaa daawa he ki dilli main congress sarkaar ke mukaable pehle hi sasti bijli di ja rahi he
 Delhi's Energy Minister Satyendra Jain claimed that today, if the price of electricity was increasing in the same way during the Congress rule, electricity would have been costlier by 5 times
 satyendra jain ke mutabik 'ek udhaaharan ke taur par samajhen ki 2010 main jab shila dikshit kii sarkaar thi tab 1 KW lod ke saath 50 unit kaa bill 153 rupee tha, jo 2013 main badhkar 264 rupee ho gaya jabaki aaj 2019 main ye ghatakar 128 rupee ho gaya
 Similarly, in 2010, with a 2 KW load, the 400 unit electricity bill was Rs 1368, in 2013 it increased to 2243 and today in 2019 it has come down to Rs 1320
 ' satyendra jain ke mutabik dilli main is samay 91% upabhokta aise hai jinka har maheene bill 400 unit se kam hi hota he
 The electricity bill is the issue on which Arvind Kejriwal started his politics in 2012
 gauratlab he ki 2013 main jab bijli bill ke mudde par arvind kejariwal ne anshan kiya tha tab aam aadmi party ke netaaon or kaaryakartaaon ne dilli ke logon se ek form bharvaya jisamen yah kaha gaya tha kii bade hue bijli bill galat hai yaa to dilli sarkaar bijli sasti kare varanaa wo bijli kaa bill nahin chukaayenge
 When senior leader of Aam Aadmi Party Manish Sisodia reached the house of the then Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit after filling lakhs of such forms, Sheila Dikshit did not meet him
 manish sitaudiya ke mutabik unako bataaya gaya ki mukhyamantri shila dikshit so rahi hai
 Whereas today Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal is there and former Chief Minister Sheila Dixit is demanding him to reduce the electricity bill

 Bollywood actress Huma Qureshi is in the news for her web series Laila these days
 is web siries main huma ne ek aisi mahila kaa kirdaar nibhaayaa he jo apane bachche kii talash karti he
 Meanwhile, a video of Huma's workout is also becoming quite viral, with which fans are trolling them
 pichley dinon huma ne leg press (pairon kii eksrasij) karte hue ek video apane instagram acount par aplod kiya tha
 In the video, Huma is seen lifting a heavy weight of 204 kg on her feet
 iske baad duusare video main unhone 245 kilo vajan ke saath eksrasij kii
 However, many people have objected to this exercise
 huma ke ye video dekhne ke baad unke kai phens ne unhen thik se eksrasij karne kii salaah di he
 Fans say that Huma is doing leg press exercise in the wrong way in the gym, which can also hurt her a lot
 video main huma ke pair bhi saaf kaanpate hue najar aa rahe hai
 After watching the video, some fans wrote that we will soon injure ourselves
 Is this the right way to do leg presses? Huma who is seen exercising in the gym is called leg press
 lekin leg press karne kaa yah sahi tarika nahin he
 For this, the legs are kept parlor, while Huma's legs are seen to be quite stretched
 saath hi vajan ko upar kii taraf lift karte vakt ghutane ko ekadam street nahin karnaa chahie, jaisaa ki huma kar rahi hai
 This can cause you a major accident

 com / vngw7fy9rf— SRIDEVI BONEY KAPOOR (@sridevibkapoor)february 28, 2018shridevi ke anmit sanskaar ke do din baad apni maa ke bare main ek imotional letters likhaa tha
 Jahnavi said in this letter- 'I and Khushi have lost their mother and father has lost his life
 'on my birthday, the only thing i ask of all of you is that you love your parents
 Cherish them and devote themselves to making them feel that love
 They have made you
 And i ask that you remember my mother fondly, pray for her soul to rest in peace
 Let the love and adulation you’ll showered on her continue and please know that the biggest part of my mother was the love she shared with papa
 And their love is immortal because there was nothing like it in the whole world
 Nothing as joyful and pure and no two people as devoted to one another as they were
 Please respect that because it hurts to think anyone would ever try to tarnish it
 Preserving the sanctity of what they had would mean the world not only to my mother but also to a man who’s entire being revolved around her, and her two children who are all that remains of their love
 Me and Khushi have lost our mother but papa has lost his "jaan"
 She was so much more than just an actor or a mother or a wife
 She was the ultimate and the best in all these roles
 It mattered a great deal to her to give love and to get love
 For people to be good and gracious and kind
 She didn’t understand frustration or malice or jealousy
 So let's be that
 Let’s be full of only good and give only love
 That would make her happy, to know that even in death, she gave you all something
 The courage and inspiration to fill yourselves with nothing but love and rid yourselves of bitterness in any way and form
 That's what she stood for
 Dignity, strength and innocence
 Thank you for the love and support everyone has shown us in the past couple of days
 It’s given us hope and strength and we can’t thank you all enough

 The fort in the Daundia Kheda princely state of Uttar Pradesh's Unnao district, where the Archaeological Survey of India is digging for the treasure hunt, is not the treasure of Raja Rao Rambakhsh Singh but his ancestor Maharaj Trilok Chand
 isaki vajah yah he ki raja raav rambakhsh ne yahaan sirf aath saal raaj kiya tha
 Actually, this treasure was collected by Maharaja Trilok Chand who ruled here in the sixteenth century
 yah khajaana mandir ke peeche sthit tile me ho saktaa he, jahaan ek samay rambakhsh ke pita babu bansat singh kaa baitka hua karata tha
 Also, this treasure can also be in the walls of the fort
 is khajaane kaa ek nakshaa bhi he, jise raja rambaksh ne apni maa ke paas chhod diya tha
 Rambaksh's mother was from the princely state of Fatehpur
 ye saare daawey dondiakheda riyasat ke jameendaar visheshwar singh ke bete professor lacmarendra singh kaa he, jo ab lakhanu main rahete hai
 Amarendra Singh's father Visheshwar Singh received his MBBS degree from King George's Medical College, Lucknow in 1924 and practiced medicine at Daundiyakheda
 inhen rambaksh ne jameendaar bana diya tha
 History of Daundia Kheda princely state and the last king of here Ravrambaksh Singh The history of this principality begins in the year 1194, when Qutubuddin Aibak attacked King Jaichand Singh of Kannauj
 us hamale main jayachand ke senapati keshav raay maare gayi the
 Keshav Rai had two sons, Abhay Chand and Nirbhay Chand
 kannauj yuddh ke baad ye donon bhai apane nanihaal punjab chale gayi
 In 1215 these two brothers came back to Unnao
 tab vahaan argal rajya tha
 During that time the Pathans attacked Argal
 is hamalen se donon bhaaiyon nen argal rajya kii rani or uski beti ko bachaaya tha
 But Nirbhay Chand was killed in this battle
 isi ke turant baad 1215 main argal maharaj ne apni beti kii shaadi abhaya chand se kar di or abhaya chand ko ganga paar kaa ilaaka de diya
 Earlier in Daundia Kheda, also known as Sangrampur, people of all castes ruled here
 abhaya chand ke pote sethu raay ne bharon kaa kila jeeta or yahaan apana rajya basaaya
 It is also known as Baiswara state
 iskaa ullekh angrej colector iliyat kii kitaab 'chronicals of unnaao' main miltaa he, joki 1881 main kanpur kaa colector hua karata tha
 Later Maharaja Trilok Chand, a descendant of Abhay Chand, became the majestic king here, who was called the most powerful king of the Vaishyas in this area
 trilok chand dilli sultanate ke badshaah behalol lodi se jude huye the
 Apart from these, King Sumer Shah Chauhan of Mainpuri was also associated with Bahlol Lodi
 trilok chand kaa rajya unnav ke alaava baharich, barabanki, lakhimpur khiri or kannauj tak failaa hua tha
 It is believed that this great treasure belongs to Trilok Chand
 raja ravarambaksh is riyasat ke aakhri raja the, jinhone keval aath saal rajya kiya
 After the mutiny of 1857, King Ramrao Baksh fled to Benares
 is dauraan angrejon nen dondia kheda kile par do baar hamalaa kiya
 Once in June 1857 and the second time in November 1858
 is hamale main topon se kile ko tahas-nahas kar diya gaya
 However, the British could not find the treasure
 rambaksh kii do raniyaan thim or un donon se unhen koi aulad nahin thi
 The elder queen was Kalankankar and the younger queen Naikin
 gadar ke baad donon vahaan chali gayi or donon kii mrityu vahiin hui
 King Rambaksh fled to Benares and took the form of a monk
 angrejon ne is riyasat ke do hisse kiye
 The first part was given to Digvijay Singh, the king of Mararamau and the second part to Maurawan, who was the treasurer of Daundia Kheda
 tab kanpur kaint angrejon kii chhavnee hua karti thi or mana jaataa he ki khatri angrajon ko rasad supplai karte the
 He too later informed the British about Raja Ravram Baksh
 oktober 1859 main raja raav rambaksh pakade gayi or 28 disambar 1859 ko angrejon ne inhen baxur ke paas faansee de di, jahaan par baad main sarkaar ne ek park banavaa diya
 The temple near the fort was built by King Rambaksh
 lekin mandir ke shikhar kii sthapana or murti sthapana 1932 main jameendaar visheshwar singh ne karai thi
 Ram Baksh's mother was from Azampur in Fatehpur district
 yahaan ke bare main bhi baba sobhan sarkaar ne ye daawa kiya he ki khajaane kaa ek hissaa vahaan bhi gada he
 Rambaksh is believed to have reported the treasure to his mother
 professor laal amarendra singh ke mutabik khajaane kii khoj ke liye iske pehle bhi khudaai ho chuki he, jise muraramu ke raja shivaprasad singh ne karaayaa tha
 Professor Amarendra Singh says that a large part of the treasure may be in the mound behind the temple
 kyonki vahaan raja rambaksh ke pita basant singh kii baithak hua karti thi
 He said that the people of the Archaeological Survey of India are not using modern technology for digging, in which metal hidden under the ground is detected by a satellite
 duusari takanic jiger counter he, jiske jariye jameen ke andar chupe metal kaa pataa lagaaya jaataa he

 com / rfoi8cvfi4— ANI (@ANI) June 29, 2019 Recently, there was a statement from India that Pakistan has refused to accept India's proposals regarding Kartarpur Corridor, on which Pakistan has given some rules and Conditions were also imposed
 pakistan ne ise lekar bharat ke lagbhag sabhi prastaavon ko maanane se inkaar kar diya tha
 Pakistan refused to accept these demands bharat ne kaha tha ki 5000 yatri har din kartarpur sahib ke darshan karen or kisi khaas din jaise baisakhi, gurupurnima ke samay 15000 yatri pratidin darshan karen, lekin meeting main pakistan ne is par nakaar kar diya
 He has said that only 500 devotees will visit every day, which is very small according to India
 2
 India had demanded that all Indian citizens and OCI card holders should visit Kartarpur Sahib, but Pakistan said that only Sikhs will go there
 3
 India told Pakistan that no matter what number of a family or a group, Pakistan should be allowed to visit Kartarpur, but Pakistan did not listen to India here too and said that only a group of 15 devotees only One can go to see India at one time
 bharat ne isko lekar aitraaj jataayaa tha
 4
 bharat ne kaha ki koi vyakti chaahe gaadi se jaae yaa phir wo darshan karne paidal janaa chahta he wo ja saktaa he, ye uski ichha ke anusaar hona chahie, lekin pakistan ne yahaan bhi apni manamaani chalaate hue kaha ki border ke paar koi paidal darshan karne nahin ja saktaa he
 a visiting devotee can go only and only by car
 5
 Kartarpur Sahib was donated 100 acres of land by Maharaja Ranjit Singh and some devotees together
 pakistan is bhoomi kaa istemaal apane liye kar rahaa he
 India said that 100 acres of land should be kept in Kartarpur Sahib Trust
 pakistan ne is baat ko bhi apni meeting ke dauraan asweekaar kar diya

 Premium charges apply!! In India, cricket is worshiped as a religion and cricketers as Gods, but in its northeast (except Assam), no one asks the game
 vahaan baichung bhutia or mairi com ke baad ab deepa karmakar jaise khilaadiyon or unase jude khelon kaa bolbalaa rahaa he
 While states like Gujarat and Maharashtra have played an important role in the development of the game of cricket in India till now, the North East Association did not even have voting rights
 lekin lodha samiti kii siforeeshon ke baad ab drishy badalane vaala he
 Northeast to be Gamechanger Now till now, Northeast has been playing a very light role in Indian cricket but now it will have five new members - Nagaland, Mizoram, Manipur, Meghalaya and Arunachal Pradesh
 bisisiai ke power shering main in rajyon kaa ahm role hoga lekin in kshetron main bahut hi kam cricket kheli jaati he
 That is, for the administrative activities, different factions will try to entice them to do it in their favor
 saath hi in rajyon kii sarkaron kaa bhi isamen ahm role ho saktaa he
 With the implementation of the age limit and the time period to continue in office under the recommendations of the Roklodha Committee on those above 70 years of age, people in large positions in 30 cricket associations of the country had to withdraw
 supreme court ke lodha samiti kii siforeeshon ko lagu karne ke faisle ke baad se hi board kii kaarypaddati main bade str par dhanchaagat parivartan hona shuru ho chukaa he
 Earlier, the age and duration of rule of any officer was not determined but now it has been fixed
 bisisiai main 70 saal se adhik kii umr par roak laga diya gaya he
 That is why the road ahead for Sharad Pawar, Niranjan Shah, n Srinivasan, IS Bindra, MP Pandove, Karnataka cricket chief Ashok Anand and Assam Cricket Secretary Arshiwad Behara has been closed
 inamen sabase bada naam sharad pavaar kaa he jo kendriya krishi mantri ke pad par asin rahete hue bisisiai ke adhyaksh rahe or lambey samay tak inaki raajnneeti kaa cricket par asar bana rahaa
 Anurag Thakur's tenure lasted only 225 days from 22 May 2016 to 2 January 2017
 teen saal ko hoga kaaryalarajnneeti main shaamil logon par pratibandh nahin lagaaya gaya lekin mantriyon or sarkari adhikariyon ke liye ab koi jagah nahin he
 Now there will be a tenure of only three years while the next three years will be spent as inactive period
 koi bhi adhikari 9 saal se adhik kii avadhi tak bisisiai kii satta se nahin judaa rahegaa
 The next three-year period after the three-year term will play a big role in the preparation of new officers
 chayan samiti kisi hogi?team ke chayan par bhi iskaa asar padegaa
 So far there have been one and a total of five selectors from each zone
 lekin ye paanch logon ke liye puure desh kii cricket par najar rakhana sambhav nahin he
 If there are more than five people in the selection committee, then their domestic cricket activities will be closely monitored
 iske falswaroop hamaare paas adhik se adhik tallent ko saamne aane kaa mauka milegaa
 The selectors who are representing the zone will understand the cricket of their region well and during the selection themselves they will be affected by some prejudices by the people sitting in power there
 jiskaa chayan ke dauraan prabhaav bhi yada kada dikhataa rahaa he
 Karnataka, Mumbai will have a monopoly? Now only former Test cricketers will be eligible for it and that too after five years of retirement
 jo sabase varisht cricketer hoga wo hi selectors ke panel kaa adhyaksh banegaa
 The experience of Test matches will also play its role
 yogya ummidavaar jinhone vanade or tii20 main desh kaa pratinidhitiv kiya he, unki chayan samiti main chune jane kii sambhaavna kam hi hogi
 This country has given a total of 286 Test cricketers since 1932
 inamen se nidhan ho chuke, umradraj or aswasthon ke saath pichley paanch varshon main ritair hue cricketron ko bhi hataane ke baad bahut vikalp nahin rah jate
 An even more important question is whether Mumbai and Karnataka, which were strong in Test cricket, will no longer have a monopoly on the selection committee
 kul milakar sawaal yah uthta he ki ab is parivartan ke baad duniya kii sabase dhani sanstha bisisiai kaa swaroop kaisaa hoga
 Players Association will be formed
 Now the CAG nominee will join its apex body which will also monitor the board's account
 ise sarkaar ke hastkshep ke rup main dekha ja rahaa he lekin supreme court ne aashwast kiya he ki kaig dwaara manonith vyakti keval paise ke flo par najar rakhega
 With this, the State Board will also control the arbitrary fund
 kuch varshon pehle tak desh ke cricket sanchaalan main cricketron kii nahin suni jaati thi
 It seems strange to hear that India, the richest nation of cricket, is the only country in which there is no players' union in Test cricket playing countries
 bina kisi players association ke cricket ke sanchaalan main cricketer test calendar or vyast kaarykram ke saath hi milane vaale paison ko lekar ab tak apni aawaaj nahin uthaa pate the
 Yes, it is necessary to mention here that it has definitely changed in the last few years
 lambey samay tak bhartiya cricket main players contract system tak maujuud nahin tha jise 2003 main laayaa gaya
 BCCI to be corruption free? Now a players association will be formed in which two cricketers, one female and one male, will be members of this supreme council of the board
 yani aane vaale vakt main bataur khilaadi ek cricketer kii aawaaj suni jaaegi
 However, given the large football organization like FIFA, it is not possible to say that the game will be completely free from corruption once the players join the cricket operations
 haa, yah sudhaar kii koshish kii ek shuruyaat jarur he
 The Congress and the NCP are currently considering an alliance with the Shiv Sena
 rajya main 12 november ko raashtrapati shashan laga diya gaya tha
 In a statement quoting Athawale, it said that only Shiv Sena and NCP will get the post of Chief Minister in turn in the government formed in support of Congress
 bhaajapa ke sahyogi athavle ne kaha ki congress ko agar mukhyamantri kaa pad nahin miltaa he to use nae gathbandhan ko samarthan nahin dena chahie
 Congress is a national party
 bataa den ki isse pehleramdaas athavle ne maharashtra main sarkaar gathan ko lekar bijepi or shivasena ke bich ek nayaa formula sujhaayaa tha
 Under which 3 years the post of Chief Minister can be for BJP (BJP) and 2 years for Shiv Sena
 maaloom ho ki maharashtra kii 288 sadasyeey vidhansabha main bijepi ke paas 105, shivasena ke paas 56 siten hai, jabaki rakanpa or congress ke paas kramash: 54 or 44 siten hai
 Any party or coalition willing to form a government in the state will need the support of at least 145 mlas to prove a majority in the Assembly

 The Union Home Ministry, which has framed new guidelines for treatment of rape victims, has declared the 'two Finger' test illegal
 iske saath hi aspataalon se kaha he ki vah peediton kii forensik or medical jaanch ke liye alag kamare banaaen
 The Department of Health Research (DHR) together with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has formulated these national guidelines to deal with such criminal cases with the help of experts
 aisi ummid hai ki ye dishanirdesh us bhayaavah chikitsakeey prakriya ko roak denge, jisase peedita ko yon utpeedan ke baad guzarana padataa he
 The DHR has also enacted a new manual to deal with the psycho-social impact of sexual violence
 ye dishanirdesh un swasthya dekhbhaal pradaataaon ko uplabdh karaae gaye hai, jo yon hinsa ke peediton ke saath kaam karte hai
 Director General of ICMR, Dr
 ve em katoch ne november 2011 main ling evam swasthya par visheshgyon kaa ek samooh gathit kiya tha
 To make these guidelines, Dr
 em i khan (yon hinsa anusandhan pahal ke sachiv) kii adhyakshata main yah samooh banaaya gaya tha, taaki jab ek balaatkaar peedita praathmik swasthya kendron or jila aspataalon main pahunchati hai to in nirdeshon kaa paalan kiya jaae
 After this, Clinical Forensic Medical Unit (CFMU) in-charge Inderjit Khandekar was given the responsibility of making these guidelines
 ye dishanirdesh logon or visheshgyon ko uplabdh karaae gaye or unki raay maangi gai
 Subsequently, they were released on 16 December 2013
 khandekar ne kaha, 'nae dishanirdeshon ke anusaar har aspataal ko balaatkaar ke maamalon main medico legal maamalon (emelsi) ke liye alag se cameraa muhaiyaa karana hoga or unke paas dishanirdeshon main bataae gaye aavashyak upkaran hona jaruri he
 According to the guidelines, there should be a provision of providing alternative clothes to the victims
 iske alaava chikitsakon evam anya chikitsa karmiyon ko in dishanirdeshon ke prati samvedansheel banane ke liye prashikshan diya janaa chahie
 Khandekar said that as per the guidelines, a third person, other than the doctor, should not be in the room while doing medical examination
 yadi chikitsak purush he to ek mahila vahaan honi chahie
 The two-finger test conducted by physicians has been made illegal and the manual assumes that it is not scientific
 chikitsakon se balaatkaar shabd kaa istemaal nahin karne ko kaha gaya he kyonki yah chikitsakeey nahin apitu kanoonee paribhaasha he
 Earlier, rape victims were investigated only at the behest of the police, but now this is not necessary
 yadi peedita pehle aspataal ke paas aati hai to praathmiki ke bina bhi chikitsakon ko uski jaanch kerani chahie
 Khandekar said that as per the guidelines, the doctors should inform the victim about the manner of investigation and various procedures and the information should be given in a language that the patient can understand
