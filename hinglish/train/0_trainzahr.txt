 guuruuvaar yani 1 sitambar ko reliance industries ne telecom market main dhamaake ke saath jeeyo pesh kiya he
 The company has not only announced but has also said that its services will be free by 31 December
 isaki khaas baat yah he ki isamen analimited 4G data bhi shaamil he jo ise aitihaasik banaata he
 During the Reliance Jio service launch, the company KMD Mukesh Ambani also listed many special features of this service in which data plan was important

 Apart from this, he said that Jio's target is 100 million customers in a year
 haalanki is dauraan company ke mukhiya mukesh ambani ne kuch aisi bate bhi kahin jo hajam nahin huin
 Mukesh Ambani: No live customer will ever pay for voice calling
 philhal companiyaan domstic kol ke liye 60 paise prati minute kii dar se charge karti hai
 You will not have to pay money on live
 bayaan kaa matlab:wais kol lagbhag free hongi
 However, users will have to pay money, because the calls made through volte will consume data and for this your plans have to be taken
 yani jab customers data ke liye paisa degaa to kol free nahin hui
 However, it is true that it will be less than the amount of money for a call
 iske alaava kuch aisepahalu bhi hai jo saaf nahin haior jald hi iske bare main jaankaree company kii taraf se di ja sakati he
 Unlimited calls have been given in all Jio plans
 sawaal yah he ki kya data yaa 28 din kii validity khatm ho jane ke baad bhi yujar kol kar sakegaa? jald hi ham isaki jaankaree hasil karenge
 Mukesh Ambani: We are sure that our plans are the cheapest plans in the world
 jeeyo bharat ko duniya ke data market main sabase hai quality or sasta karne kaa kaam karegaa
 Meaning of statement: According to us this means that they have stated that it will be the cheapest 4G data rates

 Many places get unlimited data plans for just Rs 1,000 or 2,000
 isamen bina extra paisa die 100jibi se bhi zyada data yuj kar sakate hai
 Mukesh Ambani: Jio network is also ready for 5G and 6G
 Meaning of Baiyan: According to us, the heads of Reliance Industries were trying to highlight that Jio network is built by merging several data services
 lekin network ko5g or 6G ready kahana atishyoktijaisa he
 Because the work on 5G is still going on and at the moment it is not even known when it will start for the common people

 Fasting and celebrations have a lasting effect in Indian life from villages to cities
 bharat parv evam utsavon kaa desh mana jaataa he
 Mahashivaratri festival is also celebrated enthusiastically throughout India as well as in many other countries including Nepal and Mauritius
 mahashiv raatri kaa vrath phalgun maas ke krishna paksh kii trayodashi ko kiya jaataa he
 It is the festival of Lord Shiva, which every Shiva devotees eagerly awaits throughout the year and becomes engrossed in the color of Bhakti and cannabis of Shiva
 puraanon ke anusaar, isi din sristi ke aarambh main madhyaraatri main bhagwaan shiv brahma kii kaaya se rudra ke rup main prakat hue the
 That is why this day is called Maha Shivaratri
 yah bhi mana jaataa he ki is din bhagwaan shankar or parvati kaa vivaah hua tha
 On this day, people observe fast and worship Lord Shiva
 shivaratri ke bare main hamaare veda, puraanon main bataaya gaya he ki jab samudr manthan ho rahaa tha, us samay samudr se chaudaa ratna praapt hue the
 Among those gems, there was Hallahal, due to which, all the gods and demons began to suffer due to the heat, no one was ready to drink it
 ant main shivaji ne halaahal ko paan kiya
 He left himself with a sense of public welfare
 isliye unako mahadev kaha jaataa he
 When he kept Hallahal near his throat, his heat became blue
 tabhi se unhen nilkanth bhi kehete hai
 Shiva means welfare
 jab sansar main paapiyon kii sankhya bad jaati he to shiv unhen markar logon kii raksha karte hai, isiilie unhen shiv kaha jaataa he
 It is said in the Puranas that at one time Parvati was sitting on Kailash with Shiva
 usee samay parvati ne prashn kiya ki is tarah kaa koi vrath he, jiske karne se manushya aapke dham ko praapt kar sake? tab unhone yah katha sunai thi ki pratyna naamak desh main ek vyaadh rahata tha, jo jeevon ko markar yaa jivit bechakar apana bharan poshan karata tha
 He was holding a Seth's money
 uchit tithi par karj na utaar sakane ke kaaran seth ne usko shivamath main band kar diya
 Incidentally, that day was Falgun Badi Trayodashi
 at: vahaan raatbhar katha, puja hoti rahi jise usne suna
 He also heard the story the next day chaturdashi ko use is shart par choda gaya ki duusare din vah karj puraa kar degaa
 He thought that he should sit by the river at night
 vahaan jarur koi na koi jaanavar pani pine aayega
 So he made a place to sit on the nearby vine tree
 us bel ke neeche shivlinga tha
 While he was making his hiding place, he used to throw the vine leaves which were falling on the Shivling
 vah do din kaa bhookha tha
 In this way, he had inadvertently done the fast of Shivaratri, as well as the bel-patra on the Shivling itself
 ek pahar raatri bitne par ek garbhvatee hirani pani pine ai
 The hunter mounted the arrow on the bow, but on hearing her cowardly voice, she let it go on the condition that she would come herself on the rebound
 duusare pahar main duusari hirani ai
 Left him as well
 tisare pahar bhi ek hirani ai use bhi usne chhod diya or sabhi ne yahi kaha ki pratyush hone par main aapke paas aauungi
 At the fourth time a deer came
 usne apni sari katha kah sunai ki ve teenon hiraniyan meri stri thim
 They were all flirting to meet me
 is par usko bhi chhod diya tathaa kuch or bhi bel-patr neeche giraae
 This made his heart absolutely pure, serene and soft
 praat: hone par vah bel-patr se neeche utraa
 By descending down, more bell letters climbed the Shivalinga
 at: shivaji ne prasann hokar uske hriday ko itnaa komal bana diya ki apane puraane paapon ko yaad karke vah pachhataane laga or jaanwaron kaa vadh karne se use ghrinaa ho gai
 In the morning they all came deer and deer
 unke satya vachan paalan karne ko dekhakar uskaa hriday dugdh sa dhaval ho gaya or ati kaatar hokar foot-foot kar rone laga
 Seeing all this, Shiva called all of them from the plane to his world and in this way all of them got salvation
 mahashivaratri aadhyatmik rup se sabase mahatvapurn he
 On this night, the situation in the northern hemisphere of the earth is such that the energy in the human body naturally moves upwards
 is din prakruti insaan ko apane aadhyatmik charam par pahunchane ke liye prerit karti he
 In order to take advantage of this, in this tradition we created a special festival which runs overnight
 urja ke is prakritik chadhaav main madad karne ke liye raat bhar chalane vaale is tyohaar kaa ek moolbhoot tatv yah pakkaa karnaa he ki aap ridh ko sidhaa rakhte hue raat bhar jaagen
 People living in household life celebrate Mahashivaratri as the marriage anniversary of Shiva
 sansaarik mahatvakankshaayen rakhane vaale log is din ko shiv kii dushmano par vijay ke rup main dekhte hai
 This is the day for yogis and ascetics
 jab shiv kailash parvat ke saath ekaakaar ho gaye the
 In the Yogic tradition, Shiva is not worshiped as God, but is considered the first Guru, Adi Guru, who was the originator of the science of yoga
 kai sadiyon tak dhyaan karne ke baad shiv ek din vah puri tarah sthir ho gaye
 All the movement within him stopped and he became completely immobile
 vah din mahashivaratri he
 Hence sannyas view Mahashivratri as a night of stability
 yogic parampara main is din or raat ko itnaa mahatv isliye diya jaataa he, kyonki yah aadhyatmik sadhak ke liye jabardast sambhaavnaaen prastut karte hai
 Modern science has reached that point today after going through many stages, where it proves that everything that you know as life, as matter and existence, which you know as the universe and galaxies i know, that is the only energy that expresses itself in millions of forms
 yah vaigyanik tathy har yogi ke liye ek jeevant anubhav he
 The word Yogi means a person who has recognized the unity of existence
 mahashivaratri kii raat vyakti ko iskaa anubhav karne kaa ek avasar detii he
 Yoga does not mean any particular practice or system
 aseemit ko jaanane kii sari icchhaaen astitv main ekaatmakataa ko jaanane kii sari chahat hi yoga he
 The night of Mahashivaratri presents an opportunity for everyone to experience it
 isliye jo log mahashivaratri kaa vrath nirmal chitt se karte hai, ve bahut hi sheeghra shivdham pahunch jate hai or unhen mukti praapt ho jaati he

 sansad ne 25 july ko artiai sanshodhan vidheyak paarit kiya he, jo soochna aayogon ko kamjor banaakar is kanoon ke dil par chot karata he
 Despite stiff opposition from citizens and many opposition parties, the government introduced it secretly and got it passed in both houses of parliament

 Under the RTI Act, Information Commissions decide on complaints and appeals of people in situations when they fail to get information under its various provisions
 artiai kanoon, 2005 ke tahat soochna ayuktaon ko kaarykaal kii suraksha or oonchi haisiyat, donon hasil thi or isse unhen swytt rup se kaamkaaj karne kaa adhikaar miltaa tha

 haal main hue sanshodhano main sabhi soochna ayuktaon ke kaarykaal, vetan, bhatte or sevashrtein tay karne kaa adhikaar centre sarkaar ko mil gaya he
 This has violated the autonomy of the commissions and will become like those institutions which have been termed as 'caged parrots'
 har saal deshbhar main nagarikon kii ore se takreeban saath lakh artiai aavedan daakhil kiye jate hai jisase bharat kaa artiai kanoon puri duniya main sabase zyada istemaal main aane vaala paardarshita kanoon ban gaya
 People have successfully used this law to get information about their basic rights, expose corruption and abuse of power
 is daleel kaa koi sakshya nahin he ki kanoon ke mul swaroop se iske kriyanvayan main baadha aa rahi thi, lihaaja in sanshodhano kii koi vajah nahin banati
 The government has argued that it is wrong to treat Information Commissioners as equivalent to Election Commissioners as the Election Commission is a constitutional body while the Information Commission is a legal body
 par samvidhan yaa kisi kanoon main aisa karne par roak nahin he
 The reality is that the principle of statutory tenure and the preservation of service conditions is a regular process for the office bearers of constitutional institutions to legally fix the tenure and service conditions
 vaidhanik nigaraanee rakhane vaale santhaan, jaise ki kendriya satarkta ayog or lokapal aadi ke kaamkaaj kii swatantraaa sunishchit karne ke liye aisa kiya jaataa rahaa he
 The Parliamentary Standing Committee studying the RTI Bill, 2004 before it was passed, also recommended that the status of Information Commissioners be increased to the equivalent of Election Commissioners so that they can work with full independence and autonomy
 saaf he, sarkaar ne bharose laayak tark die bina is kanoon ko kaaphi kamjor kar diya he
 This has led to speculation about his intention
 mote taur par mana ja rahaa he ki haal ke kuch faislon ne sarkaar ko naaraaz kar diya he
 These mainly include instructions on the educational qualifications of the Prime Minister and information related to his foreign visits, data related to demonetisation, and instructions on high-profile cases of fraud in relation to inconsistent npas of public sector banks
 sanshodhan vidheyak jis tarah paarit kiye gaye, isse bhi kai gambhir chintaaen khadi hui hai
 In the Lok Sabha, the NDA directly crushed all the objections of the opposition parties through its overwhelming majority
 lekin rajyasabha main is bill ko pravar samiti ko bheje jane ke ek prastaav par 15 vipakshi dalon ke dastakhat karne ke baavjood, jab matdaan kaa vakt aayaa to kai vipakshi dal is maang se peeche hat gaye
 This reinforced fears that the ruling camp put pressure on many opposition parties
 artiai kanoon ko gambhir jhatka laga he, par in sanshodhano ke vaidhanik auchity ko chunauti di ja sakati he
 Despite these attempts to disrupt the flow of information, these amendments will not break the spirits of millions of citizens who hold the government accountable through the effective use of this law
 soochna hasil karne ke apane buniyadi adhikaar ke liye aam log paardarshita ke is kanoon kaa istemaal karte rahenge

 punjab main kaam kar rahe aam aadmi party ke gaiyr punjabi netaaon se jude vivaadon se pallaa jhaadte khue party ne mangalvaar ko saaf kar diya kii party kaa mukhyamantri cheharaa punjabi hi hoga
 From the statement of Captain Amarinder Singh, in which he said that Arvind Kejriwal who is dreaming of making Chief Minister is not Punjabi and he will not allow him to enter Punjab, the Boukhalai Party said on Tuesday that if the AAP government is formed in the state then the Chief Minister will also be Punjabi
 
 gauratlab he ki punjab main chunaav sir par hai or aap ne abhi tak mukhyamantri pad ke ummidavaar kii ghoshnaa nahi kii he
 While the Congress and the Shiromani Akali Dal have already declared Captain Amarinder Singh and Prakash Singh Badal as Chief Ministership candidates, there is a fierce battle between Punjabi and non-punjabi leaders for this post
 succha singh or siddhu ne machaai khalabaliaap mukhyamantri pad ke chehre ko lekar do dhadon main banty he
 Leaders belonging to Punjab have come out in protest against the non-punjabi being made the face of the Chief Minister, which has caused a panic among the leaders of Delhi and other states, eyeing this big chair
 sutron kii maane to aap ke sanyojak arvind kejariwal kii nazren khud is pad par hai
 This is also believed to be a big reason for the removal of Sucha Singh Chhotepur and the condition of not contesting elections in front of Navjot Singh Sidhu, because both of them were falling heavily on Punjabi Arvind Kejriwal
 sukhpal singh khehara ne kaha ki captain amarinder singh kah rahe hai ki arvind kejariwal punjab ke mukhyamantri banenge, lekin vah (captain) kisi gaiyr-punjabi ko punjab kaa mukhyamantri nahin banane denge
 Khaira also said, 'captain, now that you (captain) have already agreed that only the Aam Aadmi Party government will form in Punjab, therefore the Aam Aadmi Party is also removing your doubt that in the Aam Aadmi Party government in Punjab Punjab will be the chief minister of Punjab
 ’kejariwal nahin ladenge chunaavkhehara ne kaha ki arvind kejariwal samet party kii samoochee haikaman samay-samay par spasht karti aa rahi he ki punjab main mukhyamantri kaa cheharaa punjabi hi hoga
 In many of his TV and newspaper interviews Arvind Kejriwal himself has made it clear that he (arvind) will not become the Chief Minister of Punjab and only a leader of Punjab will sit on this post
 khehara ne kaha ki party ke rashtriya netaa bhi spasht kar chuke hai ki vah punjab main gram sabha kaa chunaav bhi nahin ladenge or chunaav hote hi gujarat samet anya rajyon ke chunavi mishan par chale jaaenge
 Frustrating in the Congress, Khaihara questioned Captain Amarinder Singh and said that now that the party has fully clarified its position on the Punjabi Chief Minister, then tell him (captain) that when the Chief Minister is among the Punjabi leaders of the Aam Aadmi Party Punjab itself Will she support that name? Lashing out at Captain Amarinder Singh, Sukhpal Singh Khaira said that Amarinder Singh had not yet emerged from the Congress defeats under his leadership in 2007 and 2012 and was dazed by yet another defeat at the hands of the Aam Aadmi Party in 2017
 
 niraashaa ke alam main bheetar se tut chuke hai
 In this same rage, he has come out against the arrogant and vulgar word against Arvind Kejriwal
 unhone captain amarinder singh naseehat dete huye kaha ki janata dwaara chune gayi pratinidhi ke prati ghatiya bol bolne se gurej karnaa chahie
 Accusing Captain Amarinder Singh of 'intoxication smuggling,' Captain Amarinder Singh was severely accused of complicity with the Akali Dal and said that it was clear from the statements and speeches of Captain Amarinder Singh that it was clear to take out the rage by making fabricated allegations against the Aam Aadmi Party
 Captain Amarinder Singh has already forgotten that the Akali Dal is his rival party
 khehara ne kaha ki captain kah rahe hai ki punjab ko chitti makkhi (white fli) or chitti topi (aam aadmi party) waalon ne dukhi kiya hua he
 Amarinder Singh did not even name 'chitte' (heroin) as Chitta's black business is run by his own 'nephew' Bikram Singh Majithia
 captain amarinder singh ne nasha taskari ke sargane bikram singh majithia ke prati ek shabd bhi nahin bolaa, balki uske vakil banakar uskaa bachaav karata rahaa
 Khaira said that Captain Amarinder Singh continues to speak against him (sukhpal Khaira) every day, but never spoke about leaders like Jeet Mahendra Singh Sidhu who joined the Akali Dal after leaving the Congress
 akali dal ke saath puri tarah mileebhagat kaa sabase bada saboot bhi jeet mahendra singh siddhu hi hai, jiske up-chunaav dauraan captain amarinder singh talavandi saabon main congressi ummidavaar ke samarthan ke liye talavandi sabo hi nahin gaye the, isi tarah badal patiala se up-chunaav lard rahi maharani paranit cor ke chunaav main akali ummidavaar ke liye prachaar karne nahin pahunche the
 On this occasion, Khaira also issued a letter written by Parneet Kaur to the Chandigarh Police for the help of Jeet Mahendra Sidhu while being Foreign Minister
 khehara ne kaha ki captain amarinder singh samaj gaye hai ki unka dobaaraa mukhyamantri banane kaa sapana ab kabhi saakaar nahin hone vaala kyonki punjab ke log punjab main aam aadmi party kii sarkaar banane kaa puri tarah man bana chuke hai or baghapurana raily ne punjabiyon ke man kii baat diwaar par likh di he

 In fact, Ganguly had told the BCCI two weeks ago that he would leave from the Cricket Advisory Committee meeting at 5 pm

 It was supposed to be at 15 but at the last minute it was pushed forward for 45 minutes which led to this unfortunate situation

 inpara jaaen Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has accepted the challenge of BJP leader and UP Deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya to dissolve the Bihar Assembly and hold elections
 somvaar ko apane samvaadadaata sammelan main nitish kumaar ne utar pradesh ke up-mukhyamantri keshav prasad maurya ke ravivaar ko party ke ek kaarykram main bhaashan main bihar vidhansabha bhang kar chunaav karaane kii chunauti par bol rahe the
 After this statement, Nitish Kumar put a condition that along with this, the Uttar Pradesh Assembly should not only be dissolved but all the mps of BJP and their allies from both the states, who had won in the last Lok Sabha, should resign and all elections Let's get together
 nitish kaa bayaan na keval chaunkaane vaala tha balki bihar bijepi ke ta kaa kahana he ki maurya kaa bayaan bebajah kaa tha
 Maurya came to Patna on Sunday to participate in a party program where several leaders from the RJD and Janata Dal United joined the BJP
 maurya ne apane bhaashan main kaha tha ki nitish ji ke paas itani himmat he or apane kaam par bharosa he to chunaav ke maidan main aa jaaen or bhartiya janata party dikhaa degi ki janata kiske saath hai
 The comments nitish kumaar ne aaj ye kahkar ki wo chunaav karne ke liye taiyaar hai bihar bijepi ke netaaon kii mushkilen or badha di hai
 However, there has been no official response from the BJP to this latest reaction of Nitish Kumar
 nitish ne na keval maurya ke bayaan par balki somvaar ko bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah ke rashtrapita mahatma gandhi ko chatur banie kehane par bhi kaha ki kuch log aise bayaan dekar apni nai chaabi bananaa chaahate hai
 But he does not give much attention because Gandhi too used to defy such statements
 lekin gandhi abhi bhi sthir hai
 Nitish Kumar's direct attack on BJP leaders matters politically
 kyonki bijepi se unke madhur sambandhon ke bare main nirantar atakaley lagaai jaati hai
 In a government program on Sunday, RJD president Lalu Yadav had said openly that he too is fed up on hearing that Nitish is going with BJP
 haalaanki lalu yadav ne ye bhi kaha ki bihar kaa mahagathbandhan atoot he or rashtriya str par bhi aisa prayaas jari he
 After this statement, Nitish Kumar put a condition that along with this, the Uttar Pradesh Assembly should not only be dissolved but all the mps of BJP and their allies from both the states, who had won in the last Lok Sabha, should resign and all elections Let's get together

 Maurya had said in his speech that Nitish ji has so much courage and is confident in his work, then come to the election field and the Bharatiya Janata Party will show who the people are with
 tippaniyan Nitish Kumar has increased the difficulties of Bihar BJP leaders by saying that he is ready to conduct elections today
 haalanki nitish kumaar kii is taaja pratikriya par bijepi kii taraf se abhi koi aadhikarik pratikriya nahin ai he
 Nitish said not only on Maurya's statement but also on BJP national president Amit Shah's father of the nation, Mahatma Gandhi, be smart that some people want to make their new keys by making such statements
 lekin wo zyada tavajjo isliye nahin dete hai ki gandhi bhi aise bayanon ko hans ke taal dete the
 But Gandhi is still stable
 nitish kumaar kaa bijepi netaaon par ye sidhaa hamalaa rajnatik rup se myne rakhata he
 Because there is constant speculation about his good relations with BJP
 ravivaar ko ek sarkari kaarykram main rajd adhyaksh lalu yadav ne khulkar kaha tha ki ye baat sunakar wo bhi tang aa gaye hai ki nitish bijepi ke saath ja rahe hai
 However, Lalu Yadav also said that the Grand Alliance of Bihar is unbreakable and such efforts are going on at the national level as well
 nitish kumaar ne aaj ye kahkar ki wo chunaav karne ke liye taiyaar hai bihar bijepi ke netaaon kii mushkilen or badha di hai
 However, there has been no official response from the BJP to this latest reaction of Nitish Kumar

 haryana main bijepi phir se sarkaar banane kii baat kar rahi he lekin sarkaar banane ke liye congress kii koshishen bhi jari hai
 Now the eyes of both parties are set on Dushyant Chautala Chautala
 vidhansabha kii kul 80 siton main se bhaajapa 40 siten jitkar sabase badi party ke rup main ubhari he, jabaki congress ko 31 siten mili he
 Apart from this, Jannayak Janata Party has got 10 seats and others have got 9 seats
 inhen bhi padhein:maharashtra main banegi sarkaar to haryana main bijepi ko dushyant kii 'chaabi' se asabhartiya janata partybahumat ke jaadui aankada 46 seat se ab bhi 6 seat dur he
 If Dushyant Chautala's JJP supports her, she can easily get a majority
 iske alaava bhaajapa 6 nirdaleey vidhayakon ke samarthan se bhi sarkaar bana sakati he
 Therefore, independents also have an important role in forming the government
 agar baat karen congress kii to vah bhi sarkaar banane kii jugat main he
 Congress is also eyeing JJP chief Dushyant Chautala
 jaahir he ki majboot sthiti main hone ke kaaran dushyant chautaala bhi khub saudebaaji karenge
 It is also being speculated that Dushyant may also ask for the Chief Minister's chair from the Congress
 is bich mukhyamantri manohar laal khatter ne sabase badi party hone ke naate rajyapal se milane kaa samay maanga he
 According to sources, he can stake claim to form the government
 donon partiyaan satta kii jugat main lagi he
 Former Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda, who has been reappointed to make the Congress alive in Haryana, has declared that the mandate is against the BJP, so all opposition parties should come together
 haryana main bhaajapa apane torget 75 plus se bahut peeche rah gai
 The rebel candidates have caused a lot of damage
 saath hi bahumat se kyon chook gai
 There are many important reasons behind this
 -jat-dalit-muslim kii naaraazgi or dhruvikaran bijepi ke liye baari padaa-jat-dalit samudaay se dipti siem ghoshit hota to antar pad saktaa tha-ummidavaaron ke hisaab se bijepi ke khilaaf jat-dalit-muslim vot gaya-inld main bantwaare kii vajah se jat voton kaa sidhaa phayda congress ko mila-jatigat sameekaran ko manage naa kar paane or tikat bantwaare se nuksaan hua-13 se 16 siton par bijepi ko baagi ummidavaaron ne bahut nuksaan pahunchaaya-khatter sarkaar ke mantriyon ke khilaaf badi naaraazgi thi, chah mantri chunaav harseb baat karte hai ki agar haryana main sarkaar banati he to kya-kya sambhaavnaaen hai
 The first option is to combine JJP and BJP
 bijepi kii sarkaar banane kii duusari surat tab banati he jab bijepi nirdaleeyon ko apane saath jodne main kaamyaab ho jaae
 Whereas Congress will have to take others along with JJP to form government
 vidhansabha chunaavon main bijepi ko mili jeet se desh kaa vipaksh to chintit he hi saath main isaki dhamak videshon tak bhi sunai de rahi he
 The Chinese media has clearly stated that the growing power of the BJP can be detrimental to the relations between the two countries
 china ke sarkari media ne tippanee kii he ki haal main hue rajya vidhansabha chunaavon main bijepi kii dhamaakedaar jeet kaa asar china bharat ke rishton par padegaa kyonki yah pradhanmantri narendra modi ke sakht ravaiye ko protsaahit karegaa or china jaise deshon ke saath samjhaute ke liye dikkatein pesh karegaa
 The Global Times, run by the Communist Party of China (CPC), said that the Narendra Modi-led Bharatiya Janata Party has recently won the most populous Uttar Pradesh and also won good support in several other major state elections
 chunaav ke baad china ke sarkari media ne pehali baar tippanee kii he
 The media says that the results not only increase Modi's chances of winning in the 2019 general elections in India, but many have predicted that he is already set to get a second term
 media ke lekh main kaha gaya he ki beijing-nai dilli ke rishton ke haal main jatil or najuk daur main pravesh karne ke baad visheshgyon ne modi ke satta par pakad majboot hone ke baad se is baat par baarik najar rakhana shuru kar di ki dwipaksheeya sambandh kaise viksit honge
 Describing Narendra Modi as a working man and a strong-minded person, the article said that India's domestic and international policies through him have gone through a period of change
 antarrashtriya kshetra main, unhone kisi ko naaraaz nahin karne kii bharat kii niti ko badla he
 The article said that Modi's tough stance is reflected in both domestic policies and diplomacy
 gharelu str par jaise ucch mulya vaale noton ko band karnaa he
 The article states that internationally he has changed India's earlier attitude of never offending anyone and began to take a clear stand on disputes with other countries to maximize their interests

 It states that he has expanded defense cooperation with the US and Japan and has expressed his support for the US re-balancing of the Asia Pacific strategy and Washington's stand on the South China Sea dispute

 ) The pair of Congress's Ashok Gehlot and Sachin Pilot, ie 'krishna-arjun' of Rajasthan's politics, have conquered the political Mahabharata
 donon netaaon kii jodi soobe main satta kaa vanvaas kaat rahi congress ko rajbhishek kii ore lekar ai he
 The Congress is going to form the government
 lekin ab sawaal uthta he ki rajya kii satta ke singhaasana par rajtilak kiskaa hoga?ashok gahalot or sachin payalat donon netaa rajasthan ke mukhyamantri pad kii daud main hai
 But this race to gain power during the election never turned into such acrimony that the opposition becomes a hindrance in the political journey of the Congress
 haalanki, donon netaaon kii apni-apni lobby he or wo apane netaa ko siem pad ke daavedaar ke rup main pesh karti rahi he
 But the two leaders kept locks on their tongues and did not let their discord come to the surface
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne bhi donon netaaon ke bich gutbaji ko samajha or rajasthan main manch se sachin payalat or ashok gahalot ko aapas main milwaaya
 The result of this was that before the announcement of the election, the two leaders came out riding on a motorcycle at the Congress resolution rally in Karauli, Rajasthan
 sachin payalat bike chalaa rahe the or unke peeche ashok gahalot baith kar hamraah bane
 This was the picture that gave a message of solidarity to the Congress organization and Awam in Rajasthan preparing for elections
 rahul ne ek raily main kaha tha ki jis din gahalot or payalat ek motor cycle par savaar hokar nikle, main samaj gaya ki congress rajasthan chunaav jeet gai he
 However, by putting the differences between these two leaders on the surface of the BJP, the BJP is trying to create this sentiment continuously and is divided among the Congress factions and it will not be able to serve the public
 itnaa hi nahin bijepi baar-baar kahati rahi he ki rajasthan main satta main aegi to congress kaa siem koun hoga
 On this question, both Pilot and Gehlot kept saying that there has never been a tradition of declaring face in Congress
 party netritv vidhayakon se raay, kaaryakartaaon kii chahat or duusare sabhi pahaluon par vichaar ke baad hi netaa kaa faisla kiya jayega
 This Congress jugalbandi ousted Vasundhara Raje from power
 congress ne 99 siton ke saath sarkaar main vaapasi kii he
 In such a situation, if the Congress gets a majority, only one of these two leaders will be crowned

 On July 22, at a press conference of the Governor, a journalist asked him why Yadav is in most of the major government positions in UP
 The governor said instead of giving a straight answer

 " lekin shaayad media main hadeline kuch or ban gai, jisase ramgopal khafa ho gaye

 The ongoing politics between Haryana and Punjab on the issue of sutlej-yamuna link is not taking any name
 haryana kii mukhya vipakshi party indian neshnal lokdal ne SYL ke mudde par 10 july ko punjab se haryana hokar dilli jane vaali bason ko rokane kaa elaan kar diya he
 Leader of Haryana Opposition Abhay Chautala said in a press conference in Chandigarh that the border of Haryana to Punjab crosses five places and from here vehicles from Punjab go through Haryana to Delhi and other states
 lekin jis tarah se SYL ke mudde par punjab kaa ravaiya rahaa he or supreme court ke nirdesh ke baad bhi punjab kii congress sarkaar haryana ke hisse kaa pani dene ko taiyaar nahin he use lekar ab andolan or bhi tej kiya jayega
 He said that on Monday 10 July no vehicles from Punjab will be allowed to enter Haryana
 abhaya chautaala ke mutabik ieneldi kaaryakarta paanch jagahon par haryana-punjab kii seemaa par punjab ke vaahanon ko rokenge or haryana se hokar nahin guzarane denge
 Abhay Chautala said that vehicles going from Haryana to Punjab will be allowed to go, but those who try to come to Haryana from Punjab will be stopped and all the people of Punjab will be stopped on the border of Haryana and drink red roses and Water will be given chautaala ke mutabik vaahan roke jane ke baad logon se ye bhi darkhwaast kii jaaegi ki wo waapas jaakar apni punjab sarkaar ko bole ki wo haryana ke hisse kaa pani jald hi esavaiel ke jariye haryana ko de
 Abhay Chautala said that his agitation will go on peacefully and he said that till Prime Minister Narendra Modi does not give any solid faith to Haryana on the issue of SYL and does not assure that the water of Haryana will be made available to the people of Haryana by constructing SYL soon
 Till then this movement will continue
 vahiin indian neshnal lokdal ke is bade andolan ko dekhte hue haryana police ne bhi qamar kas lee he haryana or punjab ke mukhya sachivon ne ek baithak karke donon hi rajyon kii suraksha vyavastha ko chaak chauband karne kaa faisla liya he

 iske alaava punjab police kii taraf se bhi punjab kii seemaa par or haryana police kii taraf se haryana kii seemaa par suraksha ke kade bandobast kiye gaye hai
 Haryana DGP BS Sandhu appealed to the Indian National Lok Dal to conduct their agitation peacefully and not disturb the common people by blocking roads and roads
 bi es sandhu ne saaf kar diya ki kanoon vyavastha ko haath main lene vaale logon sesakhti ke saath nipta jayegaor isi ke liye ardhsainik balon kii bhi tainaati kii jaaegi
 The Punjab government has questioned the movement being carried out on the SYL issue of the Indian National Lok Dal
 punjab ke sinchai mantri rana gurjeet ne kaha ki jab punjab main akali dal kii sarkaar thi tab haryana main indian neshnal lokdal ne esavaiel ke mudde par naa to koi baat kahi or naa hi koi pradarshan kiya lekin jaise hi punjab main satta parivartan hua or chautaala parivaar ke najdiki badal parivaar kii sarkaar chali gai or congress kii sarkaar ai to ab ek baar phir se indian neshnal lokdal ko esavaiel kii yaad aane lagi he
 The issue of SYL is similar to Sanjeevani for the political parties of both the states of Punjab and Haryana and that is why whenever the party they feel does not back down from doing politics on this issue
 philhal haryana or punjab donon hi rajyon kii police kii koshish he ki somvaar ke vyast din hone vaale is raajnneetik pradarshan ke dauraan donon hi rajyon ke aam log pareshaan naa ho

 The house arrest of J&K leaders is a signal that the government will defy all democratic norms and principles to achieve its objects
 i condemn the house arrests
 Before the day is over we will know if there will be a major crisis in J&K

 baghel ke is bayaan ke baad bijepi or jogi kii chhattisgarh janata congress nebhupesh baghel ke khilaaf morcha khol diyaahai
 The case took a new turn when the EOW filed a case against the family members of the state Congress president in 1995 over residential plots purchased in Bhilai on behalf of Bhupesh Baghel's family
 iodblyoo ne bhupesh baghel or unki patni mukteshwari or maa bindeshwari ke khilaaf FIR darj kii he
 It has been alleged that in 1995, Bhupesh Baghel, while an ex-officio member of Sada, allotted 12 plots of LIG grade in the name of his wife and mother under the Mansarovar residential scheme in Bhilai
 iske baad sabhi 12 ploton ko milkaar unhone apana awaas banaaya
 However, when Bhupesh Baghel bought this plot, neither Chhattisgarh was formed nor was he appointed to any major position of Congress
 22 saal baad achaanak is aavanton maamle ke tool pakadaney ke baad EOW sakriya ho gaya he
 The Congress has taken this step to create political pressure and tarnish the image of the state Congress president

 However, exercise very vigilantly during this time because even one wrong move can adversely affect the health of the child and the mother

 purv bhartiya cricket captain anil kumble ko ipel ke chathe toornament kii shuruyaat se pehle mumbai indiens kaa mukhya menter niyukt kiya gaya
 Kumble is the highest wicket-taker for India in both Test and ODI cricket
 apni niyukti par kumble ne ek bayaan main kaha, ‘mumbai indiens kaaphi pratispardhi ipel team he jisamen kaaphi bade khilaadi or patibaddh maalik hai
 It is an honor for me to join the team as the main mentor

 5 may 2011 ko dilli ke vasant kunj main hue ek hatyakand ne sabko dahala diya tha
 Shobhit Modi, an IT student living in Vasant Kunj area, was adopted and killed with knives
 is hatyakand ko 1 saal se zyada ho chuke hai, lekin abhi tak dilli police ke haath kaatil kaa koi suraag nahin laga he
 There have been some revelations in the investigation of 1 year, but this whole case remains a puzzle right now
 20 saal kaa shobhit vasantkunj main rahata tha, uske pita suraj modi ek badi public sector company main general manager hai
 The secret of his death is hidden in the last 13 minutes of Shobhit's life, but there is no eyewitness to these 13 minutes
 13 minute main aisa kya ho gaya ki shobhit kii jindagi hi khatm ho gai
 Apparently, the clue behind the murderer and the murder is hidden somewhere between the mall and Shobhit's house
 kyonki katl kii raat shobhit vasant kunj mal se auto main apane ghar laut rahaa tha
 The distance from the mall to Shobhit's house is about 3 kilometers
 agar auto se ye duuri tay kii jaae to mushkil se das minute kaa vakt laganaa chahie, lekin katl kii raat aisa nahin hua, to kya raste main kuch hua tha? agar haa, to kya? 5 may 2011 kii der shaam se raat nau baj kar chalis minute tak kya kuch haa?mal main shobhit kul chah doston ke saath tha, teen ladki or teen ladke
 One of them was Shobhit's girlfriend
 donon kii skool ke jamaane se hi dosti thi
 Shobhit's girlfriend made a sudden call to her mother in the evening of the murder, called her to the mall and then went home from the bewildered mall
 baaki sabhi paanch dost bhi iske baad mal se sidhe apane-apane ghar hi gaye the
 None of these spoke to Shobhit again on the phone
 doston ke ghar jane ke baad shobhit ke cell par do kol aae
 Both of them were of another friend, Niharika
 niharika se hi shobhit ne aakhri baar baatcheet kii thi
 And it was Niharika who told that Shobhit was in a bad mood on the second call
 niharika ne hi baad main guard ke bataane par shobhit ke gharavaalo k phone kiya tha
 Even the picture is clear
 par pench iske baad hi shuru hota he, kyonki shobhit ke aakhri 13 minute kaa naa koi chashmadid he or na koi suraag
 However, there are some things which throw a deep light on this murder case
 jaise ki shobhit ko lutpaat ke liye nahin maaraa gaya
 When Shobhit fell out of the staggering gate, not only three thousand rupees were present in her pocket, but also a costly Apple iphone and a precious watch of T-shot in the wrist was also tied for about 40 thousand rupees
 yani uske saath lutpaat nahin hui thi
 Shobhit was not in any trouble, just 3 minutes before the murder, Shobhit had a conversation with the nebula
 tab uskaa mood jarur kharaab tha
 But if he was surrounded by trouble or trouble, he would have told Niharika
 phir shobhit auto se ghar aa rahaa tha, or mal se ghar kii duuri mushkil se 2-3 kilometre thi
 Shobhit stayed somewhere along the way? Shobhit was sitting in the auto to go home from the mall at 9
10 pm
 jabaki niharika kaa doosraa phone nau baj kar 27 minute par aayaa tha, or tab bhi shobhit auto main hi tha
 The last time Shobhit spoke to Niharika, it was 17 minutes before she left the mall, and even then Shobhit did not reach close to home
 yani shobhit sidhe ghar nahin gaya tha wo raste main kahin rukaa tha, yaa phir use jabaran yaa dhokhe se roka gaya tha?shobhit mal se auto par ghar ke liye niklaa tha, par ghar ke get par wo paidal pahunchataa he
 There is also a small part of the road between the mall and Shobhit's house, which is absolutely deserted, many incidents have happened in this area before
 to kya shobhit isi sunsaan ilaake kaa shikaar bana? agar shobhit auto main sachmuch mal se ghar hi ja rahaa tha to phir uske katl kii kahani kaa sach isi teen minute ke raste main chupa he jo sabase zyada sunsaan he
 Did Shobhit stop on this deserted path? Did he buy cigarettes on the way? Did Shobhit's friend meet him on the way? Or was someone already waiting there to ambush? Or is he a victim of roadrage? Amidst all these questions, another truth also came to light during the investigation
 sach ye ki shobhit ko kuch vakt se dhamkee bhi mil rahi thi, or ye dhamkee use uski garlfriend ke gharavaalon kii taraf se mil rahi thi jo sakool ke vakt se hi usik dost thi
 a few months ago this threat was given by the father of Shobhit's same girlfriend
 shobhit kii garlfriend ke pita baqayada uske ghar gaye the or uske gharavaalon ke saamne ye dhamkee di thi
 He also warned that he was acquainted with the Crime Branch officer
 is dhamkee ke baad shobhit kaa apni garlfriend se milanaa-julna kam ho gaya tha
 It seemed that both of them had a break-up, but the reality was something else, both used to talk and meet secretly
 to kya pyaar kii vajah se shobhit kii jaan gai? jaahir he police ne bhi is bare main donon parivaar se baat kii, uski garlfriend se bhi baat kii
 But no evidence was found
 poochtacha ek sach or saamne aayaa ki shobhit kii garlfriend kaa ek purana bwyfriend bhi he
 And he did not like the relationship between these two
 to kahin katl kii vajah lav triangal to nahin?kya shobhit lut kii koshish kaa shikaar bana? yaa roderez ne uski jaan lee? yaa phir katl ke peeche lav triangal kaa koi maamla he? vaardaat ke do din baad police ne shobhit ke ghar se kuch dur usee sunsaan ilaake se ek chaaku baraamad kiya
 But this murder has been done with this knife, this police could not find out till date
 philhal police kii tafteesh bhi lav triangal par aakar thahar gai he
 There are many reasons for the suspicion of the police, for example, after the investigation so far, the police are assuming that more than one people were involved in the murder, that is, the attack on Shobhit was done by many people and the attack was done with complete preparation
 
 haalanki shuruyaat main yahi police is theory par bhi kaam kar hi thi ki luteron ke kuch giroh bhi shobhit kaa katl kar sakate hai, par kyonki shobhit se kuch lutaa nahin gaya lihaaja police ne apni is theory ko khud hi gira diya
 After the incident, Shobhit's shirt was torn and apart from knives on his body, there were also bruises, which means he was also scuffled
 dilli police drugs mafia ke angel se bhi is maamle kii jaanch kar rahi he kyonki fasebuk par shobhit ke profile main bhi aisi kai baaten hai jo rahasy ke parde main he
 On his personal website, details of websites such as Wax
com, fakemail
com, Hackerspedia
com, are also available
 lekin abhi bhi police cese kii paheli ko sulajhane main naakaam rahi he

 In the interview given to Doordarshan, the controversy over bjp's PM candidate Narendra Modi not broadcasting the part that called Priyanka Gandhi as 'beti' is not yet stopped, in the meantime not to broadcast another important part of the interview The matter has come to light

 The national channel did not broadcast this part of the interview
 yah khabar angreji akhbaar 'da times of india' main chhapi he
 Modi said in this interview, 'ahmed bhai is one of my good friends, but not now

 These claims of Modi have been rejected by Ahmed Patel
 media report ke mutabik ahamed patel ne kaha, 'yah chunavi sijan he isliye log is tarah ke daawey karte rahete hai
 i did not want to comment on this controversy

 My leader Rajiv Gandhi was aware of this
 2001 main jab wo mukhyamantri bane tab se maine modi ke saath chaay tak nahin pi
 On Modi's not broadcasting this statement on Ahmed Patel, a ruckus has started once again
 bijepi kaa aarope he ki modi ke intervyuu ko sarkaar dwaara sensor kiya ja rahaa he
 On Modi's daughter's statement, Narendra Modi gave an interview to Doordarshan a few days ago in which some questions related to Priyanka were asked by bjp's PM candidate but this interview of Modi on TV aired Modi's answer on Priyanka
 had not been
 takneekee dikkaton ko isaki vajah bataaya gaya
 The first news about that part of the interview came that Modi had called Priyanka like her daughter but later that unseen clip was clarified by the BJP office that Modi has not said anything like this
 modi ke is bayaan par ek bade hi alag andaaj main priyanka gandhi ne yaad dilaayaa ki wo rajeev gandhi kii beti hai
 The answer was straightforwardly for the Narendra Modi on whom she is being stabbed on the blow with the arrow of tongue in the last 10-12 days

 or tab tak jari rahegi, jab tak sarhad ke us paar se pahadiyon ke raste hindustan ke in dushmano kaa aana band nahin ho jaataa
 To be fair, this is the second part of Operation All Out, which started from the year 2018 and by the end of the year has shown the path of Jahannam to about two hundred and fifty Pakistani terrorists
 kashmir ke emported aatankiyon kaa alam ye he ki wo jaise hi hindustan kii sarazamiin par qadam rakhte hai, unhen vaise hi jahannam pahunchaa diya jaataa he
 As a result, there has been a shortage of terrorists in all the terrorist organizations of Kashmir

 Pakistan's Urdu Daily has published an article by terrorist Hafiz Saeed titled 'india's illegitimate intervention on Mashriqi Pakistan'

 ' is artical main ek photo bhi he, jisamen dhaka main purv pradhanmantri indira gandhi khadin hai or kuch yuva apane haathon main bandook thame dikh rahe hai
 The bottom line of what Hafiz Saeed wrote in his article is how former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi conspired to break Pakistan
 kaise pakistani shaasha bhartiya sena ke saamne vifal rahe
 India also had an extensive role in the creation of Bangladesh
 saath hi wo lekh main bataa rahaa he ki pakistan ke liye kashmir mahatvapurn kyon he

 Suppose you are in the place of this groom by putting a helmet on the mare
 aapaki baraat nikal rahi ho yaa aap is lekh ko padhane vaali mahila hai to aapke sapanom kaa rajkumaar is tarah se aa rahaa ho
 The so-called upper caste goons are standing on the roof and raining stones
 tab kya aapako garv hoga ki aap ek aisi raajnneetik or saamaajik vyavastha main rahane ke liye majaboor hai, jahaan apni shaadi ke liye helmet pahanakar nikalnaa padataa he
 That too only for the fact that the groom is sitting on the mare
 ghodi yaa ghode kii koun-si jaat hoti he or hoti bhi he to pathar maarane kaa adhikaar duniya kaa koun-sa samaaj in jativaadiyon ko detaa he
 This is what happened in the village of Negroon in Ratlam district in Madhya Pradesh
 police ne pathar maarane waalon se bachaane ke liye duulhe ko helmet pahanaaya
 Policemen had to be deployed on the way to the groom's passing
 police ke adhikari bhi us baraat main shaamil hue taaki baraat surakshit pahunch sake
 Imagine what would happen to Purnalal Padiar's daughter Asha
 kya aap us apmaan ko mahasoos kar paa rahe hai
 i would like to praise the groom Pawan that he did not give up even after knowing about the wedding day or risk of injury
 haalanki meri nigaah main ghodi chadhakar shaadi ke liye janaa morrkhtaa se kam nahin he, lekin agar koi ise jativishesh kaa sawaal manaae to har dalit ko ek ghodi kharid leni chahie or darvaaze par baandh kar us par likh dena chahie ki hamane tathakthith oonchi jativaadiyon ke jaat-paat se bachaane ke liye is ghodi ko kharida he
 In September 2013, a dalit groom from a Nimda village in Ajmer district of Rajasthan showed the same courage
 gaanv ke tathakthith oonchi jati ke logon ne ghodi chadhane par dhamkee di to duulhaa ranjit singh bairava police ke paas chale gaye
 The police replied that the village tradition should be followed
 ranjit singh bairava ko dalit adhikaar centre kii sharan leni padi phir unke dabaav ke baad zila prashasan ne baraat nikaalane kii anumati di
 The Dalits of the village could not show courage but Bairwa showed it by doing this for the first time
 aise saahasik logon kaa saarvajanik sammaan karnaa chahie
 If you google, the Dalit groom has been killed for the procession
 unhen maarna peetna to aam baat he
 All this is not an event of fifty years ago, but it is of our present, in which we sing the great India the great India every day
 soshal media par aisi ghatnaon ke prati aksar chuppi rahati he
 i often try to understand the reason for this silence
 kya yahaan dalit nahin hai yaa hai bhi to apni pahchaan ujagar hone kii ashanka se aise muddon par dabaav nahin banaate
 The second silence is that of citizens who do not place themselves in the grooves of Savarna or Avarna and present themselves as a neutral India loving citizen, but they do not show activeness on such issues
 aakhir is chuppi kii vajah kya ho sakati he? Our politics never directly deals with such issues
 vot lene ke liye samaadhaan ke naam par kaaryakramon kii packaging karti he
 Sometimes Rahul Gandhi used to go to the house of Dalits
 raat guzaar lete the or khaanaa kha aate the
 The BJP was fiercely critical
 ab bijepi or sangh ne seva prakalp ke naam se thik aisa hi kaarykram launch kiya he, jiske tahat bijepi ke bade netaa daliton ke saath samuhik bhojan kar rahe hai
 This is a good effort but very limited
 packaging main hi mahaan lagata he, lekin isse saamaajik aadhaar nahin badalte
 Now the difference of casteism in buses, trains or dhabas may be less visible, but if you want to test it, then write Munna Dalit Dhaba in front of the name of a dhaba
 jaise punjabi dhaba yaa pandit dhaba yaa jain dhaba hota he
 Then survey the social background of the people coming there
 aapako aise kaaryakramon kii asaliyat kaa pataa chal jayega
 The comments sahabhojita jaat-paat kii beemaari ke ek pahalu ko khatm karti he, lekin saje dhaje shaamiyane main gharon se bulaakar laae dalit pariwaron ke saath khaanaa sahabhojita nahin he
 If you look at these programs of all political parties, they are nothing to the status quo
 sahabhojita ke naam par sah astitv ko sweekaar kar rahe hai
 Nothing more than this
 agar isse saamaajik badlaav hi laana he to har bade netaa ko ek hi thali main khaanaa chahie
 If change is the aim, then it should be said from the forum that we all need to promote inter-caste marriages
 antarjaateey matlab do tathakthith oonchi jati ke bich ke vivaah ke alaava dalit pariwaron main bhi shaadi karen
 If the BJP is a leader or activist doing this in the Congress or in any party, then it should be placed on the platform, but all this politics should not be done to get close in the name of vote
 zarurat he ki soshal media par bhraman karne vaala tathakthith nayaa bharat aise muddon par ek nae janamat kaa nirmaan kare
 They themselves break caste and destroy such traditions
 yah ghatana sharmnaak he
 One can also see this incident in this way
 khaskar vah pathak, jo apni shaadi main ghodi par chadh kar gaye the
 Did he know that he was riding such a cruel symbol of a caste system that is restricted to other Indians like him
 kya ve aisi parampara ko nibhaana chahenge
 Missed your chance, would you like to offer your children on a mare
 kya apane aise kisi dost kii shaadi main jaaenge to ghodi par chadhakar varmala pehanaane ja rahaa ho
 If a female reader is reading, would she like such a groom
 sochiyegaa

 In September 2013, a dalit groom from a Nimda village in Ajmer district of Rajasthan showed the same courage
 gaanv ke tathakthith oonchi jati ke logon ne ghodi chadhane par dhamkee di to duulhaa ranjit singh bairava police ke paas chale gaye
 The police replied that the village tradition should be followed
 ranjit singh bairava ko dalit adhikaar centre kii sharan leni padi phir unke dabaav ke baad zila prashasan ne baraat nikaalane kii anumati di
 The Dalits of the village could not show courage but Bairwa showed it by doing this for the first time
 aise saahasik logon kaa saarvajanik sammaan karnaa chahie
 If you google, the Dalit groom has been killed for the procession
 unhen maarna peetna to aam baat he
 All this is not an event of fifty years ago, but it is of our present, in which we sing the great India the great India every day
 soshal media par aisi ghatnaon ke prati aksar chuppi rahati he
 i often try to understand the reason for this silence
 kya yahaan dalit nahin hai yaa hai bhi to apni pahchaan ujagar hone kii ashanka se aise muddon par dabaav nahin banaate
 The second silence is that of citizens who do not place themselves in the grooves of Savarna or Avarna and present themselves as a neutral India loving citizen, but they do not show activeness on such issues
 aakhir is chuppi kii vajah kya ho sakati he? Our politics never directly deals with such issues
 vot lene ke liye samaadhaan ke naam par kaaryakramon kii packaging karti he
 Sometimes Rahul Gandhi used to go to the house of Dalits
 raat guzaar lete the or khaanaa kha aate the
 The BJP was fiercely critical
 ab bijepi or sangh ne seva prakalp ke naam se thik aisa hi kaarykram launch kiya he, jiske tahat bijepi ke bade netaa daliton ke saath samuhik bhojan kar rahe hai
 This is a good effort but very limited
 packaging main hi mahaan lagata he, lekin isse saamaajik aadhaar nahin badalte
 Now the difference of casteism in buses, trains or dhabas may be less visible, but if you want to test it, then write Munna Dalit Dhaba in front of the name of a dhaba
 jaise punjabi dhaba yaa pandit dhaba yaa jain dhaba hota he
 Then survey the social background of the people coming there
 aapako aise kaaryakramon kii asaliyat kaa pataa chal jayega
 The comments sahabhojita jaat-paat kii beemaari ke ek pahalu ko khatm karti he, lekin saje dhaje shaamiyane main gharon se bulaakar laae dalit pariwaron ke saath khaanaa sahabhojita nahin he
 If you look at these programs of all political parties, they are nothing to the status quo
 sahabhojita ke naam par sah astitv ko sweekaar kar rahe hai
 Nothing more than this
 agar isse saamaajik badlaav hi laana he to har bade netaa ko ek hi thali main khaanaa chahie
 If change is the aim, then it should be said from the forum that we all need to promote inter-caste marriages
 antarjaateey matlab do tathakthith oonchi jati ke bich ke vivaah ke alaava dalit pariwaron main bhi shaadi karen
 If the BJP is a leader or activist doing this in the Congress or in any party, then it should be placed on the platform, but all this politics should not be done to get close in the name of vote
 zarurat he ki soshal media par bhraman karne vaala tathakthith nayaa bharat aise muddon par ek nae janamat kaa nirmaan kare
 They themselves break caste and destroy such traditions
 yah ghatana sharmnaak he
 One can also see this incident in this way
 khaskar vah pathak, jo apni shaadi main ghodi par chadh kar gaye the
 Did he know that he was riding such a cruel symbol of a caste system that is restricted to other Indians like him
 kya ve aisi parampara ko nibhaana chahenge
 Missed your chance, would you like to offer your children on a mare
 kya apane aise kisi dost kii shaadi main jaaenge to ghodi par chadhakar varmala pehanaane ja rahaa ho

 Sahbhitaita eliminates one aspect of caste-based disease, but eating with Dalit families brought from homes in a decorated shamiana is not co-partnership
 tamaam raajnneetik dalon ke in kaaryakramon ko dekhenge to ve yathasthitivaadee se kuch nahin hai
 Accepting co-existence in the name of Sahibhita
 isse zyada kuch nahin
 If it is to bring social change, then every big leader should eat in the same plate
 agar badlaav laana hi makasad he to manch se kahana chahie ki zarurat he ki ham sab antarjaateey vivaahon ko badhaava den
 Inter-caste means in addition to marriages between two so-called upper castes, marry in Dalit families as well
 agar bijepi congress yaa kisi party main aisa karne vaala koi netaa yaa kaaryakarta ho to use manch par bithaaya janaa chahie, lekin yah sari raajnneeti vot ke naam par kareeb aane ke liye nahin hona chahie
 There is a need that the so-called New India touring on social media should create a new public opinion on such issues
 khud bhi jati tode or aisi paramparaon ko dhaha de
 This incident is shameful
 is ghatana ko is tarah se bhi dekh sakate hai
 Especially the reader who climbed the mare at his wedding
 kya unhen pataa tha ki ve ek jati vyavastha ke aise krur pratik kii sawari kar rahe the, jo unke hi samaan anya bharatiyon ke liye pratibandhit he
 Would they like to follow such a tradition? apana mauka to chook gaya, kya aap apane bacchon ko ghodi par chadhaanaa chahenge
 If you go to the wedding of such a friend, then you are going to put on a mare and wear a garland
 agar koi mahila pathak pard rahi he to kya wo aise duulhe ko pasand karengi
 Will think zarurat he ki soshal media par bhraman karne vaala tathakthith nayaa bharat aise muddon par ek nae janamat kaa nirmaan kare
 They themselves break caste and destroy such traditions

 KM Cariappa, who had the distinction of becoming the first Indian Chief of the Indian Army after the independence of the country, joined the British Indian Army shortly after the end of the First World War
 unhone san 1947 ke bharat-paak yuddh main pashchimi seemaa par bhartiya sena kaa netritv kiya
 Cariappa was awarded the rank of Field Marshal on April 28, 1986, and died on May 15, 1993
 koun banegaa pradhanmantri
 Which party will get how many seats
 ye sab aise sawaal hai, jin par in dinon sabase zyada charchaa ho rahi he
 Five phase voting has been held
 543 main se 425 siton par vot daale ja chuke hai
 There are two rounds of voting left
 congress, bijepi, bahujan samaaj party, samaajawaadee party, aam aadmi party, tiemasi samet anya partiyon ne bhi chunaav main sabakuch jhonk diya he
 BJP fought many previous elections in the name of Ram
 laalkrishna adwani kii aguai main puure desh main rath yatra nikaali gai thi
 But in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Ram's entry is from the backdoor
 piem narendra modi ne ayodhya ke paas jansabha kii lekin ram mudda nahin ban paae
 But a viral video made Ram an issue in West Bengal
 mamata ne diya maukapradhanmantri narendra modi, bijepi yaa kisi anya party netaa ne ab tak ram ko mudda nahin banaaya tha
 But a viral video gave the BJP a chance to cash in on the issue
 yah kaam kiya he pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee ne, darasal pichley dinon mamata banerjee ke saamne bhaajapa kaaryakartaaon ne jai shriram ke naare lagaae to vah bhadak gai thim
 When the BJP workers in Chandrakone in West Bengal did so, they stopped their convoy and threatened them that they should remain here even after the elections
 mamata ne kaha tha, ye log jo naare laga rahe hai unhen 23 may ko chunaav ke nateezon ke baad anjaam bhugatna hoga
 a video of this incident also went viral
 shah bole- lagaaungaa nareiske baad mangalvaar ko bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah ne pashchim bengal ke west medinipur main raily kii or manch se khud jai shriram ke naare lagaae or janata se bhi lagavaaye
 He openly challenged Mamata Banerjee and said that he would raise slogans, which become, uproot
 amit shah kii raily se pehle mamata ne vishnupur raily main kaha, bijepi babu, aap jai shri ram kehete hai, lekin kya aapane ab tak ek bhi ram mandir banaaya
 Ramachandra becomes an agent of BJP as soon as elections are held
 aap jai shri ram kehete hai or dusron ko bhi jabardastee bolne ko kehete hai
 The political rhetoric on increasing seats seems as if the BJP tried to provoke Mamata Banerjee on the issue of Ram and she also succeeded in it
 ab shriram kaa mudda ayodhya nahin balki pashchim bengal ko bana diya gaya he
 It is worth noting that PM Modi also did not say anything about this issue except Ayodhya rally
 ayodhya raily unhone jai shri ram ke naare se khatm kii thi
 BJP is more focused on West Bengal this time
 uskaa rajya main zyada se zyada seat jeetne kaa makasad he
 BJP got 2 seats in 2014 out of the 42 seats in the state
 mumkin he ki bijepi ram ke mudde par rajya main apni seat badhaane kaa mauka shaayad hi chhodeygi
 Amit Shah said- Protecting human rights is the responsibility of the government, which lies in Kutumbakam, the human rights obligation: The Union Home Minister Amit Shah said that the Modi government has adopted a policy of zero tolerance against death in police custody
 ek bhi vyakti bina kisi kaaran ke police castady main na mare, ek bhi vyakti extra jeudicial kiling kaa shikaar na ho, yah hamaara daayitv to he hi, magar saath hi har vyakti ko sammaan ke saath jeene kii vyavastha mili, ye bhi hamen karnaa padegaa
 Addressing the 26th Foundation Day celebrations of the Human Rights Commission, Shah said that it was for the first time on the issue of human rights after the Modi government came to power
 unhone kaha, 'bharat kaa samvidhan ham sabake liye sarvocch he
 It is our job to protect the rights that all citizens have got under the Constitution, the work of the system, the work of the government and the work of organizations like the Human Rights Commission
 'is dauraan amit shah ne aatankwaad or naksalwad ko sabase bada maanavadhikaar ke hanan kaa kaarak bataaya
 He said that in Kashmir, more than 40 thousand people have fallen prey to terrorism
 unhone sawaal kiya ki jin nagarikon kii aatankwaadiyon ne hatya kar di, kya unke pariwaron kaa maanavadhikaar kuch nahin he?vasudaiv kutunbakam main samahit he maanavadhikaar amit shahasamaroh ko sambodhit karte hue shah ne kaha, 'hamaari samskruti, hamaara desh or hamaara samaaj varshon se sankuchit soch se upar uthakar vasudaiv kutunbakam kii bhaavana se sochane vaala desh he
 When you consider the whole world to be your family, then the responsibility of human rights appears to be contained within Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam
 'unhone kaha ki jahaan tak bacchon or mahilaon ke maanavadhikaar kaa sawaal he, to hamaare desh or samaaj main maanavadhikaar se sambandhit vyavasthaaen pehle se inbilt hai
 Within our family system, a lot of rights of women and children are protected without law
 amit shah ne kaha- atal or shaashvat hai baapu ke siddhanthamanvadhikaar ayog ke sthapana diwas samaaroh main shah ne kaha, 'pichley saal hi bharat ke maanavadhikaar ayog ne apni silver jubilee manaai he
 i believe that within 26 years, a lot of work has been done to create awareness in the Human Rights Commission among the people of India
 'unhone kaha ki ham mahatma gandhi kii 150veen jayanti manaane ja rahe hai
 The whole world is going to use the 150th year of his birth anniversary to move forward on Bapu's principles
 ham sab chaahate hai ki mahatma gandhi ke siddhant rileavent hokar saamne rakhe jaaen, kyonki gandhi ke siddhant shaashvat or atal hai
 Our government fought a different type of human rights fight: Shah Amit Shah while addressing the function said, 'our government has fought for human rights in a different way and has also achieved success
 ham sabakaa saath sabakaa vikaas kaa concept lekar chalate hai
 For 70 years of independence, 5 crore people in the country did not have a house, 3
 5 karod logon ke ghar main bijli nahin thi, 50 karod logon ke paas swasthya suraksha nahin thi or mahilaon ko shauchalay uplabdh nahin the, kya ye in logon ke maanavadhikaar kaa hanan nahin he?' It was also a terrible December day
 thik paanch saal pehle dilli main 16 disambar ke charchit nirbhaya samuhik balaatkaar vaale din kii tarah
 This time the bus changed place and the thing that made it go wrong was that the innocent people were just six years old
 9 disambar, 2017 kii raat ko dilli se kareeb 200 kilometre dur haryana ke hisar ke uklana kasbe kii us chah saal kii bacchee ko ghar se uthaa liya gaya or kathith taur par balaatkaar ke baad nirmam tareeke se hatya kar di gai
 The next morning his corpse, blood-soaked, was found naked in a street there
 darindagi kii had ki us bacchee ke guptang main kareeb 24 centimetre lambii lakdi daal di gai thi
 The child's family had been living in the slum there for about 10-12 years and lived as a laborer
 ghatana vaali raat uske pita ramesh nath mazdooree karne gudgaanv gaye the or bacchee apni maa ke saath apni jhuggi main so rahi thi
 Remembering the condition of his daughter, Ramesh yearns, "we are poor people
" hamaari bacchee ne kisi kaa kya bigaada tha, jo uske saath aisa saluk kiya gaya
 His killers should be sentenced to death
 " haryana main bacchon ke khilaaf jaghanya aparaadh kaa yah iklauta maamla nahin he
 On September 8 this year, a seven-year-old Pradyumna Thakur student was strangled to death in the bathroom of Ryan International School in Gurgaon
 thik isi tarah deshbhar se bacchon ke khilaaf aparaadh kii bhayanak ghatnaon kii khabaren lagaataar aa rahi hai
 On November 25, 12-year-old Chhotu Kumar was killed along with his father in Ravidas Tola in Jhandapur in Bhagalpur, Bihar
 uski bahan se kathith taur par balaatkaar or uski hatya kii koshish kii gai
 The victim is still struggling with life and death in the hospital
 rashtriya aparaadh record beuro kii 2016 kii report ke mutabik, deshbhar main jahaan bacchon ke khilaaf kul aparaadh ke maamalon main 13
 While 5 percent growth has been recorded, it has increased by 105 percent in Bihar
 yah alam tab he jab mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne bacchon ko lekar bal-vivaah jaisi kuritiyon ke khilaaf muhim ched rakhi he
 Although the state's IG (weaker section) Manju Jha claims, "many works are being done to stop the increasing crime against children
" "bacchon par aparaadh ke maamle main uttar pradesh kii haalat bhi behad kharaab he (dekhen graphics)
 The state is at the forefront of total crime against children, Protection of Children from Sexual Offenses Act (POCSO) and Kidnapping and Abduction of Children
 bal adhikaar kaaryakartaaon ke mutabik, garibi, sarkari bhrashtachar, naitik mulyon kaa hraas, internet or tivi par aparaadhiyon kii kahaniyaan aadi bacchon ke khilaaf aparaadh ko badhaava dete hai
 He says that two generations in the society are going through a period of psychological and cultural transition
 gaanv-gaanv main mobile par sulabh internet par parosi ja rahi ashleelata ne bhi bacchon ke khilaaf aparaadh ko badhaayaa he (dekheh mehmaan kaa panna)
 Says Nisha Jha, former chairperson of the Bihar Child Protection Commission, "in states like Bihar, incidents of crime against children are increasing continuously due to economic-educational backwardness and culture
 log korporate culture or ajukeshan ke badalte swaroop kii khaamiyon kii vajah se kuntha ke shikaar ho rahe hai
 "but the worrisome situation for children is not limited to states like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar
 pashchim bengal se lekar assam, maharashtra, kerala or tamilnadu ke aankade bhi chintajanak hai
 The nearly 20% increase in incidents of crime against children in 2016 compared to 2014 shows that the central government has also failed to stop it
 desh main bacchon ke saath balaatkaar main bhi pichley saal ke mukaable 82 fisadi vruddhi hui he
 In November 2017, a 10-year-old girl was gang-raped in the old area of bhopal, Madhya Pradesh
 bacchee ke pita kii maut ho gai thi or uski maa mehnat-mazdooree karke kisi tarah guzar-basar kar rahi thi
 In the absence of the mother, the girl was taken by a lady from the neighborhood by greed and by giving her a trophy, three men made her a victim of their lust
 bacchee kii maa kahati hai, ''hamaari bacchee ke akelepan kaa phayda un logon ne uthaa liya kyonki ham garib the
 Strict action should be taken against them
 "madhya pradesh kul balaatkaar ke maamalon ke alaava bacchon ke balaatkaar ke maamalon main bhi desh main pehle paaydaan par he
 Not surprisingly, the dropout rate at the girls' secondary school rose to 26 per cent last year in the state that gave the idea of "beti Bachao, Beti Padhao"
 lekin pradesh ke dijipi rishi kumaar shukla balaatkaar se jude aankadon ko police kii uplabdhi bataate haih ''pradesh main balaatkaar kii jaankaree milte hi maamla darj kar liya jaataa he, jisaki vajah se aankade zyada dikhte hai
 "keeping in mind the increasing cases of rape of children, constant criticism and assembly elections next year, the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh Shivraj Singh Chauhan has unanimously passed the Penal Laws (madhya Pradesh Amendment) Bill-2017 on December 4
 isamen 12 saal se kam umr kii ladakiyon ke balaatkaar ke maamalon main faansee tak kii sajaa kaa praavdhaan he
 It has a provision to increase the punishment to 14 years rigorous imprisonment, life imprisonment and increase the punishment to 20 years in cases of gang rape
 iske alaava chhedchhad ko gaiyr-jamaanti bana diya gaya he
 However, social workers are also apprehensive about this law
 pradesh main saamaajik muddon par kaam karne vaali gaiyr-sarkari sanstha vikaas sanstha ke rakesh malviya kaa kahana he ki aakhir sarkaar ise kis tarah lagu karegi, yah sabase bada sawaal he
 He says, "it also raises a big doubt that criminals should not kill the girls after rape, to destroy the death penalty by destroying the evidence

 But at the same time a big question arises about the implementation of the law

 On the one hand, where crimes are increasing, on the other hand, the rate of filing of charge sheets of cases by the police and the rate of conviction from the court has come down

 Vimal Prakash, a social worker working on the Jhandapur case in Bhagalpur, says, "things get worse when the victims are from poor or disadvantaged communities

 Neither their police hears, nor the government nor their cases in court are dealt with fast, even they usually do not get justice

 The argument is that your government will earn more, save more money in the common man's pockets and your banks' chests will be full
 in teenon ke asar se kaarobaar main tej growth dekhne ko milegi
 Is it very important to do this that the government should not only provide relief from income tax to make the common man's pocket heavy, but should stop making income through income tax when this reform process is perfectly fit

 jaaniye kaseachche din aaenge?sarkaar ne blike iconomi par lagaam lagane or blikemani ko arthvyavastha se baahar karne ke liye dimonetigeshan kii prakriya shuru kii he
 Has the demonetisation process just brought bad days? Could the coming days be worse? So pay attention to the figures, because the figures themselves are telling that good days are also coming
 dimonetigeshan kii prakriya kitni ahm he iskaa andaja is baat se lagata he ki sarkari aankadon ke mutabik arthvyavastha kul 18 lakh karod rupee kii he
 The total black economy in the country is 84 lakh crores

 After starting this drastic process of demonetisation, Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Belgaum, Karnataka admitted that people are suffering from this
 unhone vishwaas dilaayaa ki yah ksht kuch hi maheenon kaa he kyonki iske jariye sarkaar ne aam aadmi ke liye bade phaayde kaa rasta saaf kar liya he
 In the same context, in June 2016, BJP leader Subramaniam Swamy claimed that if he had settled, he should order the country to abolish the income tax in a week
 haalanki ki ve sarkaar nahin hai, lihaaja aage daawa karte hue kaha ki maujuuda sarkaar ko agle teen saal ke andar desh se inakam tex ko khatm kar dena chahie
 At the same time, after the demonetization process started, BJP President Amit Shah issued a statement that due to this process, the problems faced by the common man will be taken into consideration in the budget coming in February

 If the black economy in the country has increased manifold during the last nearly 70 years, black money is buried in the country and abroad, then it is clear that this government structure has completely failed

 Maharashtra and Delhi, the two states of the country, alone pay more than 53% income tax

 The surprising figure is that 70 years of economy and government infrastructure are less than 3% of the people in the country (about 3
 67 karod) se inakam tex vasuul paati he
 At the same time, based on the PAN card number created in the country, it is estimated that in the coming days income tax can be collected from 21 lakh additional people in the country

 Tax experts claim that the banking transaction tax (BTT) is a very important option in the direction of financial reform after GST

 Since all transactions of buying and selling will take place through the bank, the black economy will be less likely to revive in the economy

 maamle main vivaad badhane ke baad pehle congress party or phir sunni vakf board ne kapil sibbal se kinaaraa kaat liya
 The Sunni Waqf Board also lashed out at Kapil Sibal for the matter
 haalanki thodi der main hi sunni vakf board ne isse yutern le liya
 Earlier, Haji Mahboob of the Sunni Waqf Board said that Kapil Sibal is our lawyer, but he is associated with a political party
 mangalvaar ko supreme court menram mandir kii sunwaayee taalane kii sibbal kii mangagalat thi
 We want a resolution at the earliest
 haalanki thodi hi der main wo apane bayaan se palat gaye
 He said, "if the confessor of Babri Masjid Action Committee, Zafaryab Jilani justifies Kapil Sibal's statement, i agree with him
 '' philhal unke is badale rukh kii vajah kaa pataa nahin chal paaya he
 In the case of Jibaniyam who came to the rescue of Sibal, Zafaryab Jilani says that all this is made up of media
 media bijepi kii hi baat karti he
 We agree with Kapil Sibal
 kapil sibbal ne hamase baat karne ke baad ye maang kii or yah sach bhi he ki maamle kaa raajnneetik phayda uthaane kii koshish ho rahi he
 The Prime Minister is referring to the statement of Kapil Sibal in Gujarat
 kya modi sirf hinduon ke hi piem hai: jilanijilani ne kaha ki kya is mudde par piem kaa baat karnaa shobhaa detaa he? unhone kaha ki isse har haal main bijepi ko hi phayda ho rahaa he
 Haji Mehmood has not spoken to us
 unase baat hogi, to wo bhi hamase sahamat hogen
 We have been fighting this battle for so many years
 aise kaise is par daawa chhod denge
 The mosque has been under occupation since 1950
 piem modi ko isaki phikr nahin he
 Is Modi only the PM of Hindus? Do they not care about Muslims? At the same time, when Haji Mahboob disagreed with Kapil Sibal's statement, Prime Minister Narendra Modi immediately praised it and called it a bold statement
 saath hi maamle ko lekar bijepi or hamalavar ho gai
 While Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulated the Sunni Waqf Board for clarifying its stand on the issue, BJP President Amit Shah again attacked the Congress
 Yes Kapil Sibal is our lawyer but he is also related to a political party, his statement in SC yesterday was wrong, we want a solution to the issue at the earliest: Haji mehboob,sunni Waqf Board # Ayodhyapic
 twitter
 com / cmn8mxr5ta— ANI (@ani)december 6, 2017buudhvaar ko bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne kaha ki ab sunni vakf board ne bhi kah diya he ki supreme court main ram mandir maamle kii sunwaayee taalane ke kapil sibbal ke bayaan se vah sahamat nahin he
 Shah tweeted that it was clear from the Sunni Waqf Board's statement that Kapil Sibal sought to postpone the hearing of the Ram temple case as a Congress leader, not as a lawyer for the Sunni Waqf Board in the apex court
 sibbal ne congress haikaman ke nirdesh par aisi maang kii thi
 The BJP president said that the Congress's showing on the Ram temple is extremely shameful
 Now that Sunni Waqf Board has said that they don’t agree with what Kapil Sibal said in court, it is certain that Mr
 Sibal spoke in his capacity as a Congress leader, with the blessings of his High Command
 Shameful posturing by Congress on Ram Temple issue!— Amit Shah (@amitshah)december 6, 2017isse pehle mangalvaar ko bhi amit shah ne maamle ko lekar congress par joardaar hamalaa bolaa tha
 Regarding the matter, BJP President Shah had directly asked Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi that what is your party and your stand regarding Ram temple? He had said that the BJP wants that the issue should be heard in the Supreme Court at the earliest and the decision should come, so that a grand temple of Lord Shri Ram can be built in Ayodhya, which is associated with the faith of the country
 mangalvaar ko bijepi adhyaksh ne kaha tha ki aakhirkaar ram mandir maamle kii sunwaayee rokane se kya hasil hone vaala he? ram mandir cese kii sunwaayee ko lekar congress party ko apana rukh spasht karnaa chahie
 He had said that on the one hand Rahul Gandhi is going to the temple in Gujarat, on the other hand Kapil Sibal is being used to postpone the hearing on the Ram Janmabhoomi case
 congress party ko apana ruukh spasht karnaa chahie
 After all, what did Kapil Sibal say in the Supreme Court? While appearing for the Sunni Waqf Board, Kapil Sibal had argued in the Supreme Court that the hearing be deferred till July 2019, as the matter has become political
 kapil sibbal or rajeev dhawan ne court se kaha tha ki is maamle kii jald sunwaayee subramanyam swami kii apil ke baad shuru hui, jo ki is maamle main koi party bhi nahin hai
 Sibal had said that the court should not send a wrong message to the country, but should hear the case with a large bench
 unhone kaha ki ram mandir kaa nirmaan bijepi ke 2014 ke ghoshnaptr main shaamil he, court ko bijepi ke jaal main nahin funsana chahie
 Kapil Sibal had told the court that the atmosphere of the country is not yet such that the case can be heard properly
 kyon is masale ko lekar hadabadi main sunwaayee ho rahi he
 Kapil Sibal, on behalf of the Sunni Waqf Board, has demanded that 5 or 7 judges' bench should hear the case after the 2019 general election
 kyonki maamla raajnneetik ho chukaa he
 Kapil Sibal and Rajiv Dhawan had objected to this and said to boycott the hearing
 unhone kaha tha ki ayodhya main hui khudaai par eesai kii puri report bhi abhi record kaa hissaa nahin bani he
 The documents in the record are incomplete
 sabhi pakshon kii taraf se anuwaad karwaae gaye kul 19,950 pannon ke dastavej court main aupchaarik tareeke se jamaa hone chahie
 He had said that all the documents which have been kept before the Lucknow Bench of Allahabad High Court have not been brought before the Supreme Court

 # MYTA post shared bymalaika Arora (@malaikaaroraofficial) onmar 7, 2019 at 9:01 pm PST Malaika said she was happy with these results
 unhone kaha, "main koi aisa faisla nahin le sakati thi jis par main adig na rah sakuun
 i was not in a state of any kind of restriction
 main is baat se khush hum ki yah aapako move on karne kii aazaadee detaa he, nae chunaav karne kii aazaadee detaa he, nae faisle lene kii aazaadee detaa he
 So that you can lift your head and go into the world and leave the weight of your past behind
 "malaika ne kaha, "baat ye he ki shaayad sabhi relationships main rahanaa chaahate hai yaa move on karnaa chaahate hai yaa dobaaraa pyaar main padana chaahate hai
 No one wants to be single or single for life
 baavjood iske ki mere ird gird maujuud log kuch na kuch kah rahe the, mujhe khushi he ki maine apane dam par ye faisla kiya tha
 However, Malaika and Arbaaz have moved forward in their lives
 malaika jahaan ab arjuna kapur ko date kar rahi hai vahiin arbaj khan jeeorgia andriyani ke saath relationships main hai
 When asked about the relationship with Arjun Kapoor, Malaika laughed loudly and said that all this is made up of media
 bharat-china ke bich doklam ko lekar do maheene se gatirodh jari he
 In Doklam, the Chinese media is constantly trying to create pressure by threatening India to retreat
 bharat ko phir 1962 jaisaa sabak sikhaane kii dhamkee di ja rahi he
 However, so far India has responded to China in a very restrained manner
 asia ke do bade deshon ke bich seemaa par najuk tanatani par duniya kii bhi nazren hai
 If you look at things carefully, the situation in India is more or less similar to 1962
 acha yah he ki is baar kai chijen bharat ke paksh main hai
 Many countries are openly with India
 mana ja rahaa he ki america-japan jaisi mahashaktiyaan bhi bhartiya drushtikon se sahamat hai or china ke saath apaat sthitiyon main madad kar sakati hai
 Please tell that Doklam is a tri-junction between india-china and Bhutan
 samrik rup se bharat or bhutan ke liye ye ilaaka behad ahm he
 This is the region of Bhutan that China is claiming
 june ke madhya main china ne yahaan atikaraman kar sadak banane kii koshish kii thi
 Seeking help from Bhutan, the Indian Army halted Chinese manufacturing and is stationed there
 1962 main is tarah thi sthiti1962 main jis vakt bharat or china ke bich tanaav shuru hua us vakt duniya kii raajnneeti bhi kareeb-kareeb aaj kii tarah hi thi
 Right now there is a conflict between North korea-japan-america
 teenon yuddh ke muhane khadey hai
 Just like in 1962 there was a conflict between cuba-america and Russia
 tab chini hamale ke dauraan bharat dwaara madad maangane par america aage aayaa tha
 However, by the time India got American help, China had retreated
 vishleshkon ke hawaale se bibisi hindi ne apni ek report kaha he ki cuba main tanaav kii vajah se rus dwaara misile tainaat karne ke baad america chaahakar bhi vakt par bharat kii madad nahin kar paaya
 It has also been seen as a 'communist strategy' in the report
 sambhaavna jataai gai, ho saktaa he china ko america pratirodh se bachaane ke liye rus ne misile tainaat kar america ko cuba main ulajhaa diya
 So in such a situation the help of us-china will not be found that America and Japan are in favor of India in the changed politics of the world
 wo china ke khilaaf bharat kii madad bhi kar sakate hai
 But if during this time North Korea attacked, then America and Japan would not be able to help India even if they wanted to
 yahaan yah bataanaa jaruri he ki uttar korea or china ke kootnithik rishte kaaphi achche hai
 While major countries of the world banned North Korea, China continued to help the mysterious country
 haalanki belastic missile testing ko lekar america dabaav kii vajah se haal hi main china ne uttar korea par kai tarah ke pratibandh lagaae hai
 But his relationship is still considered quite good
 kya he japan kaa rukh?is bich japan ke rajdoot kenji hiramatsu ne ajtak se baatcheet main kaha, 'doklam ko lekar pichley kareeb do maheenon se tanatani jari he
 We believe that this may affect the stability of the entire region, so we are keeping a close watch on it
 ' iske saath hi unhone kaha, china or bhutan ke bich is kshetra ko lekar vivaad he
 As far as India's role is concerned, we believe that it is interfering in this matter only on the basis of its bilateral agreement with Bhutan
 doklam par kya he bharat kii ranneetidoklam par bharat kii ranneeti saaf he
 India is not in a mood to back down on Chinese terms
 bharat kii koshish he ki china, bhutan ke ilaake ko khaali kar de
 He should not do such an act which worsens the situation in TRAI Junction

 - taran adarsh (@taran_adarsh) August 11, 2014 agar aap purvi dilli main rahete hai or sadak par kooda phenkna apni shaan samajhate hai to saavdhaan ho jaaen kyonki ab aisa karnaa aapako salaakhon ke peeche pahunchaa saktaa he
 The East Delhi Municipal Corporation can now show vigor against those who throw garbage using its powers contained in the DMC Act
 dilli main kooda uthaanaa emsidi ke kshetradhikaar main aata he
 But the BJP, which has been in power in the corporation for the last 11 years, has proved to be a flop in this matter
 ab bijepi shasit east emsidi ne is samasya ke liye khud ko paak saaf dikhaate hue kooday failaane waalon par hi ungali khadi kar di he
 The corporation has decided that the right to take action against the garbage spreaders will now be strictly adhered to and the waste throwers can also be sent to jail if needed
 nigam ke ek varisht adhikari ke mutabik nigam ke paas ye adhikaar diemasi act main pehle se hai lekin ab lau afasar ne court se baar-baar milti diarection ke baad sab adhikariyon ko circular bheja he ki wo iskaa sakhti se paalan karavaaen
 Let us tell you that if someone is caught in Delhi, then under Section 188 and Section 133 of CRPC, a penalty of 1 to 6 months can be fined or up to Rs 1000
 iske alaava section 270 ke tahat yadi koi vyakti gandagi karte paaya jaataa he jisase infections fail saktaa he yaa insaanon kii jaan ko khatra ho saktaa he to use 2 saal tak kii sajaa yaa phir jurmaana yaa phir donon ho sakate hai
 Now on that decision of the corporation, the Aam Aadmi Party has asked the question, why there is no action on those who have the responsibility of picking up the garbage? Aam Aadmi Party leader Saurabh Bhardwaj has said that the big problem is that the garbage is not clean Neither does it sweep
 kooda phenkane waalon ko aap bhale jail main daaliye lekin un adhikariyon kaa kya jo kaam nahin karte lekin 10 saalon se selary mil rahi he?saaf he 10 saalon tak satta sukh bhogane ke baad anti inakambency ko maat dete hue teesri baar piem modi ke chehre par chunaav jeetne valibijepub dilli ko saaf suthra to dikhaanaa chaahati he lekin uskaa ye tarika shaayad dilli waalon ke gale naa utre

 shodhakartaaon ne paaya he ki profile photo darshakon ko pehali hi najar main prabhaav daalane kaa kaam karti he
 Whether it is negative or positive
 itnaa hi nahin log keval photo dekhakar hi turant is nattejey par pahunch jate hai ki falaan aadmi dheer gambhir prakruti kaa he yaa chil chhabila tip he

 pinto kehete hai, "salmaan paatrataaon or suvidhaon kii us vyapak samskruti kaa pratik ban gaye jisase saikadon hajaaron yuva ladke khud ko jodate the or uski nakal karnaa chaahate the
 "when the accident happened in 2002, this formula was working
 salmaan abhinetri aishwarya raay ke saath pingen badha rahe the, us samay charam par chal rahe nirdeshak sanjay lila bhansaali ke saath kaam kar rahe the, or bollywood chori chori chupake chupake (2001) jaisi filmon ke anderworld se khataron kaa saamana karne kaa dard jhel rahaa tha
 He was young, flamboyant, playing with fire and also being successful
 haadase kii subah 27 sitambar, 2002 ko ek akhbaar ne lekh chapa tha jisamen aishwarya se unke rishton main talkhi kaa zikr kiya gaya tha
 In this article, Aishwarya had told about drunk Salman; Who threatened to go to his place of work and disobeyed his wishes, told him about a boyfriend who never liked to listen in response
 aishwarya ne kaha ki ve yah sab isliye kah rahi thim kyonki iskaa asar unke kariyar par pad rahaa tha
 He had said, "let the others say whatever they want
 lekin jo bhi isse jude hai, ve hakeekat jaanate hai, ishwar sakshi he
 "he had drawn a stubborn man who had absolutely no fear of any consequences
 is bich bahari taur par khan parivaar lagaataar zyada samaveshi hota dikhaai de rahaa tha
 One of Salim Khan's two wives is the famous Helen
 arbaj khan kii patni bhi purv glamer girl malaika aroda hai
 But sources reveal that in many cases this family was also very traditional
 aantarik rup se yah parivaar aisi tedi chaal main chal rahaa tha jo kisi filmi patakatha main hi sambhav yaa taarkik lag sakati thi
 Salim Khan was commanded by expenses and all decisions
 sutara is baat kii ore bhi ishaara karte hai ki salmaan kaa bachapan asal jindagi main itnaa mushkil or sakht tha ki ve parade par thik uske ulat atyadhik-mardwaadi chhavi main khud ko dhaalane lage
 The Khan family was always very generous and generous and many of Bandra's old settlers and the film industry did not get tired of telling stories of their help
 unke bare main 'achche log' hai, kaha jaataa or salmaan is viraasat ko behad gaurav se dhote hai
 Sareshwala says, "it is not in the nature of the Khan family not to stop and help someone
 isiilie main in reporton ko sahi nahin maanata ki salmaan haadase kii jagah se bhaag gaye
 "after the accident, the contradictions of the family have been constantly brought about by Salman and he has carried them
 us haadase kii parinti yah hui ki salmaan kii chaal par lagaam lag gai
 Television personality and Salim Khan's friend Amit Khanna explains how he changed after that accident
 "us samay ve ekadam alag the—bhadkile, hathi or gairjimmedaar
 It was clear that they started changing after the accident
 jis salmaan ko ham aaj dekhte hai, vah 15 saal pehle vaala salmaan nahin he
 "nurullah Mehboob Sharif, who was sleeping on the pavement outside Bandra's American Express bakery under the wheels of his car, clearly had a great burden on him
 kuch samay tak ve dishaheen rahe
 There was a buzz in her voice that she could not be trusted to complete a film
 apni cinemai maujuudagi se asli jindagi kaa talmail, yah yakeen ki ve asal jindagi main bhi galat samajhe gaye nayak hai, dhire-dhire saamne laayaa ja rahaa tha
 When director Puneet Issar was asked about the pride in 2004, he admitted that the character of the film's misunderstood hero was played on Salman
 jaise-jaise abhiyog jaden pakadte gaye, salmaan khud ko bade parade par zyada josh ke saath pesh karne lage
 He also became the founder and emperor of Bollywood's purported hundred crore club
 partner (2007), wanted (2009) or dabang (2010) ne unhen aishwarya or haadase ke baad kii jadta se baahar nikaala, or ek tha tiger (2012) ne kisi film ke liye pehle hi din sabase zyada 32 karod ru
 Earned
 jaahir tha, tab tak salmaan puri tarah se 'sone ke dil vaale pareshaan or galat samajhe gaye ladke' kaa jivan jeene lage the
 In an interview given to this writer in 2012, he admitted that he continued to host Bigg Boss because it was like imitating his life in a glass house, which was always open for public scrutiny
 salmaan ne kaha, "meraa bedroom meri apni jagah he lekin meri baithak puri duniya kii he
 "salman used to say that he enjoyed the show because he also wanted to give the audience a chance to see the real people, not just the people they are formed by their perceptions
 jab kik (2014) ai or usne 225
 1 Crore Rs
 kii kamai karke ek tha tiger ko bhi peeche chhod diya to bade parade par salmaan kii 'acchhee' chhavi ko amar kiya ja rahaa tha
 As the center of the film industry, for which he is a dependable betting earner star, Salman's image makes it clear why people are so proud about his punishment
 ek baar faisla jehan main utar gaya to ulate salmaan hi the jo gavaah ke kathghare main baithe hansate, majaak karte najar aa rahe the or gam main duube apane parivaar kaa manobal badhaane kii koshish kar rahe the
 His image as a hero, philanthropist has become so enigmatic that he was playing the role of a patron saint even in times of need
 khanna kaa kahana he ki bollywood kii yah peedi yah maan lene kii galati kar rahi he ki sari achchhaaiyaan kisi aparaadh ko halkaa kar sakati hai
 "that can not be
 ye donon do alag-alag chijen hai
 "much of the mismatch comes from Salman's front-of-the-screen and behind-the-scenes images
 15 june tak ke liye jamaanat par chute salmaan khan ke gallexi apartment ke aage jamaa bheed yah nahin samaj paa rahi thi ki us par abhinayta salmaan kii vajah se laathiyaan barasaai ja rahi hai yaa salmaan khan naam ke us shaks ke liye jisane 13 saal pehle ek ghaatak bhul kii thi
 People forget one thing that even if you mix the image of the screen with the behind the scenes image, but all tragic heroes are suffering from some fatal weakness
