 Everyone has read a lot on the subject of love
 
 Much has been written on the lover-girlfriend, but little or nothing has been written about the love letter
 aakhir kyon prem patr kii zaroorat padi
 
 us jamaane main jab shabdon kaa thik se avishkaar nahin hua tha
 
 
 And in today's era when there are phones, messaging apps to say everything
 
 
 tab bhi kyon lekhnee kaa itnaa mahatv he
 
 jab ham aasaani se mil sakate hai
 
 
 Why chat (modern love letter) is heavy on everyone, even if you can call anytime? Let's start from the beginning
 
 The era when letters were the only medium of communication
 
 Then this love letter must have been invented
 
 
 us jamaane main jab soch itani aadhunik nahin thi
 
 
 It was not possible to meet anywhere
 
 Therefore, this letter must have been resorted to in order to bring out the emerging emotions of the heart
 
 Because it was full of love, love was added before the letter
 
 
 aage aage to shabdon ke arth nikalate rahe
 
 prem paati, pyaar kaa pehla khat or naa jane kya kya!ali sardaar jaafaree: wo shaayar jise aazaadee ke baad janaa padaa jail
 
 
 So this is the reason that invented the love letter
 
 Why now, despite the passage of centuries, its existence did not end
 
 
 kyon log isko sahejkar rakhte rahe, kyon dil kii har baat ko isamen ukerte rahe, darasal, sabase pehali baat to himmat kaa naa hona rahaa, saamne prapoj karne ke baavjood naa sunne kii himmat nahin thi, isliye letters main apane dil kii har baat likhnaa aasaan laga or use apni sampurna bhaawanaaon ke saath apane mehboob ko dena hi sukun detaa rahaa
 
 
 
 ab likhnaa hi kyon
 
 
 
 isaki bhi vajah dilachasp rahi hogi
 
 jab ham kehete hai to saamne vaala aksar sunanaa pasand nahin karata
 
 wo bich bich main apane sawaal le aata he, aapke andar kii bhaawanaaon se kahe gaye shabd bhi dabakar rah jate hai
 The velocity at which you want to say the same front suppresses them
 
 Here, you write in love
 
 You say everything
 
 
 koi rokane tokane vaala nahin hota
 
 jo bhi kahana chaahate ho use kehete ho
 
 dobaaraa likhte ho
 
 
 Words spoken by the mouth do not come back, but here you check many times
 
 
 lekin ye sab to shaayad sunne vaale ke sabar par nirbhar karata he 
 
 ho saktaa he wo acha shrota ho or aapke prem prastaav ko purna dhairya ke saath sun bhi le
 But the next act of love letter goes beyond everyone's expectations
 
 
 tu kal chalaa jayega, to main kya karuunga
 
 
 Mohammed Azizprem letter got depressed while singing, when he reaches near the front, he reads it
 
 
 kai baar 
 
 dobaaraa 
 
 
 Tibara also reads and if you understand the feelings of the loved one, he reads the round and again
 
 
 premi yaa premika ke kahe shabd uske dil main utar jate hai
 
 
 His feelings reach as far as he wants to deliver them
 
 So this is the form of love letter
 
 Arise from here and after that, keeping them in hand, sending roses in them, spraying perfume has been a witness to their change
 
 But there will be smells, whenever there will be words
 
 
 kaagaj, khushbu yaa phir phool to isamen murjhaa hi gaye hai
 
 
 Now it can be understood by anything
 
 Somebody's first love letter or something else is simply the fact that people want to write a lot in a different way, which is probably best written through a letter
 
 
 koi kabhi mili naa mili lekin bhavanaaen or intazaar hameshaa barkaraar rahata he
 
 
 Which is nothing better than a love letter to say

 isse unki pahchaan chuphi rahati he
 The scene is filmy, but very real
 ek sirphira ashiq ek model ke ghar subah-subah ghus jaataa he
 He claims that the model is his life, but then as soon as the model and his shocked-troubled household deny this relationship of coercion, that madness becomes an enemy of the life of his desire
 aanan-fanan main model samet uske puure ghar vaale ko unheen ke ghaki main bandhak bana letaa he
 After this, the real drama begins
 philhal isaki pahchaan ye he ki ye ek sirphira ashiq he
 Love it from a model
 model se shaadi karnaa chahta he
 But the model and her family did not agree
 phir kya tha nae jamaane kaa ye sabase tazaa majanuun usee model ke ghar main ghus kar model samet puure ghar waalon ko chaaku kii nok par bandhak bana letaa he
 After this, this lover of the new era takes full advantage of the new technology
 mobile par video kol ke jariye police ke saamne apni sharten rakh kar
 This mob has been standing under this building here for hours
 kidnaping kii aisi kahani or kidnaping kii aisi vajah in sabake liye nai thi
 Therefore, they were all on the ground and that freak lover in a flat 70 feet above the ground
 is dhamkee ke saath ki zaraa bhi gadabad hui to wo apni jaan kii jaan lene se bhi nahin hichkegaa
 In such a way, the Nawabs and the city of lakes had never heard of any such story before and had taken the entire house hostage for marriage and had not seen such a picture
 manzar or kahani kuch kuch sholay film ke us aitihaasik seen kii yaad dilaa rahe the
 Many people among the crowds standing below had requested to come down from the head of love
 kaha tha aa jaao
 Do you know how to make a relationship through conversation film main to viru neeche utar aayaa
 But Bhopal was not considered a lover
 ab shahar ke bichon-bich ek flats main ek puraa parivaar bandhak tha
 And on the mercy of Sirfire Aashiq
 police haath par haath rakh kar baith bhi nahin sakati, or ashiq kii aashiqui kab utre kisi ko nahin pataa tha
 But had to try
 lihaaza, sabase pehle police ne puri kahani suni or samajhi
 So that further steps can be taken and the story was somewhat different
 zamin se kareeb 70 feet kii oonchai par ek aashiq divaana ho gaya
 In this madness he crossed such a limit
 puraa kaa puraa police or prashasan kaa amala jamaa kar liya
 The story started many years ago
 magar khatm bhopal ke misarod ilaake kii gold city farchune socity ke paanchaven floor par hui
 Unrequited love made that crazy rebel
 kareeb 70 feet kii oonchai par paanchavin floor ke flats main usne apane pyaar ko hi kaid kar liya
 And by removing the hands of the houses themselves, he started showing the sign of victory
 maano kah rahaa ho ki usne apane pyaar ko jamaane se chin liya
 Rather not only snatch, but also made a slave
 jab ladki ne is siraphire aashiq kii zid ko maanane se inkaar kiya to usne use lahooluhaan kar diya
 Moreover, it showed the whole world by making a video of its bravery
 us siraphire aashiq kii sanak thi ki wo shaadi karegaa to sirf isi ladki se varanaa naa ye jeeyegaa or naa ladki ko jeene degaa
 And when the girl refused to marry, this madness locked her love in the room
 ladki ko kaid karnaa tha ki misarod ilaake kii is gold city farchune socity main dehshat much gai
 Police and media reached the spot
 police siraphire ko samajhane kii koshish karne lagi
 But he was not ready to listen to anyone
 police ke mutabik kamare main khud ko or apni garlfriend ko band karne vaale is siraphire aashiq ke paas ek desi katta or ek kanchi thi
 While the girl's family members locked it in another room
 ladki jakhmi he, khud ye sirphira bhi jakhmi he, lekin in jakhmon ko police kii jyaadati kaa nateeja bataa rahaa he
 Inside the room, these madcap Aashiq and the girl are both bled, the boy has threatened the police that he will shoot the girl if he is forced into force
 police kaa puraa amala flats par maujuud tha
 An attempt was made to talk to the boy, but instead he told the media, police and the rest of the people to come down from the building
 is bich usne pani kii maang kii
 Police transported water to him from the building's roof via a bucket
 phir ye flats kii balakani main aayaa, balakani main lagi gril se haath nikaalkar pehle usne victory jaisaa sin banaaya
 Then took out the other hand, five fingers appeared, waving two fingers of the other hand also
 ishaare se wo kuch kahana chaah rahaa tha, lekin uske ye ishaare kisi ko samaj main nahin aae
 The police was involved in getting the boy free from the clutches by entangling this boy in his talks since morning
 kai baar police se baat bhi hui
 In between, the boy demanded a charger from the policemen
 charger ke bahaane police andar ghusna chaah rahi thi
 As soon as the boy opened the door, a police officer GS Rajput grabbed his wrist, but the boy stabbed him with scissors on his hand and injured him and then locked the door from inside
 
 The house where the boy has held the girl hostage
 wo usee ladki kaa ghar he
 It is being told that this madman came to this house at 6 am on Friday and as soon as he entered, he took the girl as well as her family members hostage
 ladki ko uske changul se azaad karaane ke liye police rescue exparts ko bhi bulaayaa
 This madman, who created a furore in Bhopal, is a resident of Aligarh in UP and his name is Rohit
 jis ladki ko usne bandhak banaaya he, bataaya ja rahaa he ki wo uske ekatarfa pyaar main pagal he
 The police are also terrified by the craziness of this craze
 police ko dar he ki agar uske saath sakhti kii gayi to kahin wo ladki or uske gharavaalon par goli naa chalaa de
 So the police is taking a lot of precaution in this matter
 aaropee rohit ne police se kaha ki jab tak papa nahin aaenge darwaja nahin kholoongaa
 And see the police of Bhopal that she waits for Rohit's father from morning till night
 is bich uski farmaaish ke hisaab se chizein muhaiyyaa karaati rahi
 Moreover, when the madman asked for stamp paper to write his love letter, the police also reached with it
 phir rohit ne peedit ladki par dabaav banaakar usase ek affidavit main pyaar kaa izhaar karavaaya
 i want to marry Rohit Singh aka Regal Singh
 ham log ek duusare ke bina nahin rah sakate
 We have known each other for two years
 ham log mumbai main modelling karte hai
 All i want to say is that if we are not married, we will not be able to live
 kai ghanton tak tamaasha jari rahaa or police us tamaashe ko dekhati rahi
 Rohit's enthusiasm was also increasing due to this reception of the police
 lihaaza ladki ko bandhak banane ke saath saath usne puure ghar ko bhi lagaataar bandhak bana rakhaa he
 And he is making video calls from inside the room himself
 apana video bhej rahaa he
 It was also appealing to people to make this video viral
 video main ladkaa jakhmi dikhaai de rahaa he, jabaki ladki jakhmi or besudh haalat main bistar par padi he
 Blood is scattered around
 jis ladki ko is siraphire ne ghar main kaid kar rakhaa he, wo beasenal ke purv afasar kii beti he, emtek kii padhai kar rahi he or mumbai main modelling bhi karti he
 According to the police, this boy named Rohit Singh is madly in love with this model
 is ladki se uski mulaakaat mumbai main hi hui thi
 Where Rohit also modeled
 rohit or is model kii saath main tasviren bhi saamne ai hai
 It is said that this boy was behind this model, while the girl was upset with him
 ladki do maheene pehle hi mumbai se apane ghar bhopal ai thi
 During this, Rohit Singh also reached Bhopal
 rohit ke khilaaf is ladki ne misarod thane main pareshaan karne kii shikaayat kii thi
 After this, the police caught Rohit from Aligarh and brought him to Bhopal
 baad main rohit jamaanat par reeha ho gaya tha
 On Friday morning Rohit again threatened this girl's house
 darwaja ladki ne hi kholaa
 After this, Rohit took the family hostage and locked himself in a room with the girl
 aisa lag rahaa tha ki ladki ke saath uski hathapayee hui, jisamen wo khud ghayal ho gaya or ladki ko bhi ghayal kar diya he
 In the video sent by Rohit, blood is seen scattered around him

 aap agar padhgaye ke shaukeen hai or sanyog se aapako koi nayaa technofrendli lekhak bataae ki uski kitaab publish hui he, to aap kya kahenge? yahi na ki apni kitaab dijie
 If you get advice on downloading an app instead of a book? Then it can be guessed that he will be dealing with any venture of phone publishing by the young technosavy publisher Chick Sarkar
 bharat main yah concept apekshaakrit nayaa he
 The government that brings it to the country says, "today India has the most smart phone users, readers are getting smarter, so publishers should also move ahead with traditional methods
 phone par jab shopping ho sakati he, filmein dekhi ja sakati hai, sisitivi nigaraanee ho sakati he, phone par maujuud ap raste bataa sakate hai to phir phone par kitaab kyon nahin publish ho sakati yaa padhi ja sakati he?"bharat aisa desh he jahaan log sabase zyada samay phone par bitaate hai
 Therefore, the concept of phone publishing can provide many new opportunities and options for both writers and readers
 sarkaar ke shabdon main, ''iskaa matlab yah bilkul nahin ki log kitaaben nahin padhenge yaa unki ahmiyat kam ho jaaegi
 This means that there will be a new kind of experiment in the world of publishing
 ham donon tareekon ko samanaantar chalaayenge
 When buying a book you choose from your interest
 phone par bhi aap vahi padhenge jo aapke man ko bhayega
 The difference is that you are free to subscribe as well as subscribe on the phone publisher app
 pathak ke liye yah behad handi he to publisher ke liye kam sansadhano main publicing house chalaane kaa jariya
 You can sit in any corner of the world and read any book
 sarkaar ke publication jagarnott publishars ne angreji or hindi, donon bhashaaon main kitaaben chhapni shuru kii hai
 Books in these languages are also available in the Juggernaut app
 chiki sarkaar ne 2015 main publicing house kii neenv rakhi or jald hi is duniya main ek anoothaa or nayaa prayog kar daalaa
 He realized concepts like phone publishing on April 22, 2016 and provided a new medium of reading to Hindi readers
 kindal jaise i-book store bharat main kaaphi pasand kiye ja rahe hai
 But Juggernaut has moved a step further than e-book or e-library to publish books on the phone
 iske liye pathak ke phone par har vakt internet jaruri nahin he
 You can enjoy reading it offline by downloading a story or story once
 phone publisher hone kaa sabase bada phayda he ki agar kisi kahani ko siries main publish karnaa chaahate hai to ise aasaani se kiya ja saktaa he
 Chick Sarkar says that phone publishing is a very interesting step for India's readers and writers, turning it into a device
 ve chaahati hai ki publicing kii duniya main bhi bharat duusare deshon ke saath kadamtal kare
 When asked if Juggernaut's emphasis will be on phone publishing now, compared to traditional publishing houses
 ve kahati hai, ''aisa bilkul bhi nahin he
 Our three main objectives are: First, to provide books to the maximum number of countrymen to study
 doosraa, zyada se zyada bharatiyon ko likhane ke liye prerit karnaa he
 The third objective is to make the written content interesting and intuitive
 ye saare kaam ham donon madhyamon se karne kaa prayaas kar rahe hai
 "on one hand, 5,500 books have been published from Juggernaut
 ye sabhi paaramparik publicing house se prakashit hui hai
 However, the number of Hindi books in it is around 600
 utsahjanak baat yah he ki phone publicing ko bhi log pasand kar rahe hai
 So far, 1 million people have downloaded different content through it
 tvinkal khanna kii kitaab samet kai kitaaben best sailing hai
 In such a situation, Juggernaut will work on its digital avatar, further solidifying its identity
 aatmavishvaas se labarej chiki sarkaar se jab ye poocha gaya ki aakhir publicing jaise bijness ko hi unhone apana kariyar kyon banaaya? ve bataati hai ''ghar kaa maahaul hameshaa hi padhgaye-likhane vaala rahaa
 i grew up between books
 mere khun main hi kitabon kii khushboo he
 “actually Chik Sarkar’s father Avik Sarkar a
 bi
 P
 media group ke pramotor or maalik hai
 The government says i was inspired by the home environment itself
 sarkaar ne kolkata se schooling or oxford uniwarsity se padhai puri karne ke baad publicing kii duniya main kadam rakhaa
 He started his career at Bloomsbury Publication House, London
 2006 main ve bharat lautin or dilli ke random house ko jwine kiya
 She joined Penguin in 2011
 varsh 2013 main penguin books or random house kaa jab vilay hua to sarkaar isaki indian branch kii head baniin
 "there is a big difference between the publishing industry in India and the UK," she says
 bhartiya publisher kitabon ke liye agents par nirbhar nahin hai
 "she also says that the publishing industry in India is not a very profitable business
 lekin is kshetra main sambhaavna bahut he
 Urvashi Butalia, publisher of Juban Books, says Sarhana of the government says, "the choice of the government is excellent in terms of books, on the one hand they provided books according to the interest of the public and on the other hand they also provided books of literary mood
 "sarkaar ne chunauti bhari shuruyaat to kar di he lekin ab bhavishya ke bare main unki kya yojana he? aage kaa bijness plan kya kahata he? ve kahati hai, ''ham rail yatri or mek maai trip jaise kai upakramon ke saath partnership kii yojana bana rahe hai
 We are working towards how to increase our subscription
 " ve kahati hai ki kitabon yaa ap kaa content pathakon kii ruchi ko dhyaan main rakhte hue chunaa jaataa he
 She says, the practice of studying on the phone is still in a very early stage
 jaahir he, logon ko isaki aadat lagane main abhi samay lagegaa

 The Supreme Court held that since the Delhi High Court has ruled on the same matter, its decision should be challenged to move forward, and there is no justification for a separate petition as the two cases cannot run simultaneously
 darasal, dilli hoicourt ne apane faisle main dilli sarkaar ko jhatka dete hue kaha tha ki uparajyapal hi dilli ke prashaasak hai

 In this letter, Rahul Gandhi has written that it is an honor for me to work for the Congress party
 congress party kii vichaardhaara hameshaa se bharat jaise khubasurat desh kii seva karnaa rahi he
 As party president, i take responsibility for the Congress' defeat in the Lok Sabha elections 2019
 party ko bhavishya main aage badhaane ke liye haar kii jimmedaari tay karnaa jaruri he
 That is why i have resigned as the President of the party
 rahul gandhi ne patr main likhaa he ki party ko agar aage badhanaa he to 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main haar ke liye kai logon ko jimmedaari leni hogi
 In such a situation, as the party president, if i do not take the responsibility of defeat and hold others responsible, then it would be dishonest
 mere kai sahyogiyon ne mujhase kaha ki aap party adhyaksh ke liye kisi naam kaa chunaav karen
 But it would be unfair that i suggest a name
 hamaari party kaa itihaas purana he
 It is an ideological party and i respect it
 aise main mujhe puraa vishwaas he ki party kisi ek achche netaa kaa chunaav karne main puri tarah se sakasham he jo party ko majboot netritv de saktaa he
 It is an honor for me to serve the Congress Party, whose values and ideals have served as the lifeblood of our beautiful nation
 i owe the country and my organisation a debt of tremendous gratitude and love

 The attack on our constitution is to spoil the fabric of the country
 main congress kaa ek vafaadaar sainik hum or bharat mata kaa sachcha sapoot bhi
 In such a situation, i will fight till the last breath to save the country
 rahul ne likhaa he ki hamalogon ne saaf suthere tareeke se loksabhaa chunaav ladaa he
 Our campaign was on the basis of brotherhood for all religions of the country
 maine pradhanmantri or aresas se ladaai ladi
 i fought for the institutions they captured
 maine ye ladaai isliye ladi kyonki bharat se pyaar karata hum
 i fought this battle for the ideology of the country
 is dauraan main kai baar apane aap ko bilkul akelaa mahasoos kiya
 During this time i also learned a lot from my party members, women and activists
 unke jazbe or kaam karne ke tareeke se siikhaa
 He has written that to take this fight forward, the Congress Party will have to be revamped
 aaj bhaajapa bharatiyon kii aawaaj ko dabaa rahi he
 In such a situation, it is the responsibility of the Congress party to save them
 bharat kabhi bhi ek sur vaala nahin rahaa he
 There are many notes here
 yahi bharat kii pahchaan rahi he
 Finally, i thank the thousands of Indians who supported me
 main puri takat se congress kii vichaardhaara kii ladaai ladata rahoonga
 i will always be present for the party, whenever i need or ask for my advice
 main un kaaryakartaaon ko bhi dhanyavad detaa hum jinhone congress kii vichaardhaara kaa lagaataar samarthan kiya he
 It has become prevalent in India that no strong person leaves power
 lekin ham bina satta ke moh chode vichaardhaara kii ladaai main apane pratidwandvi ko nahin haraa sakate
 i am a born Congressman and the party is always with us
 main is bachaane ke liye aakhri dam tak laduunga

 Manoj Tiwari has become the President of Delhi BJP but it seems that he will have to walk the difficult path of politics yet to take over the command of the party
 kyonki party ke andruni sutara bataa rahe hai ki manoj tiwari kii nai team main unki marzi nahin chali he balki nai team kii list kendriya khel mantri vijay goyal or party ke pradesh prabharee shyaam jaju ke ghar par taiyaar hui he
 Now even though Manoj Tiwari is talking about taking everyone along and laughing away the questions, the factionalism has started a new stir within the Delhi BJP before the MCD elections

 He was on a tour of Assam in connection with some program
 dilachasp ye he ki jab manoj tiwari assam se laute to unki nai team ke sadsy unki agavaani karne orport tak pahunch gaye
 Actually, the other party leaders are also surprised by the faces that have come in the new team of Delhi BJP
 hairaani is baat kii bhi he ki vitt mantri arun jetali ke karibiyon ko bhi darkinar kar diya gaya he jabaki adhyaksh koi bhi ho sanghathan main arun jetali ke karibiyon kii maujuudagi hameshaa rahi he
 The party has appointed Kuljeet Chahal, Ravindra Gupta and Rajesh Bhatia as general ministers, two of them are councilors and it is being told that the party's state in-charge has been instrumental in their appointment

 The state president Poonam Parashar was appointed despite this, despite the fact that the state president also comes from Purvanchal
 haalanki punam parashar ke mutabik wo ab mahilaon se kiye vaade puure nahin karne par kejariwal sarkaar ko gherne main koi kasar baaki nahin rakhengin
 Kuljit Chahal, the new General Secretary of the party, says that there is no factionalism in the party, Manoj Tiwari is a capable president and the new youth team headed by him will work with full vigor
 party ke mahaamantri rabindra gupta emsidi chunaav ke lihaaj se nai team ko majboot bataa rahe hai
 He said that the team chosen by Kitiwari is a strong team for the MCD election, which will highlight Kejriwal's adventures
 haalanki team ke elaan ke baad khule taur par bijepi main koi virodh saamne nahin aayaa lekin netaaon ne party hai kaman ke saamne na sirf apni naaraazgi jataa di he balki nai team ko kamjor team bataane se bhi peeche nahin rahe hai
 Vice-captain Rohit Sharma said on Thursday that India's World Cup squad is almost sure, but no one should be assured of his place, as anyone can be dropped from poor form

 ’ Australian batsman Aaron Finch said captain Virender Sehwag and Venugopal Rao would take over the batting in the absence of key players from Delhi in the fifth phase of the T20 League
 purv captain mahela jayavardhane, kevin petersan or wellington main dakshin africa ke khilaaf test ke dauraan kalai main chot laga baithe raas tailor tii-20 paanch ke shuruaati kuch maichon main uplabdh nahin ho paayenge
 Finch said that hence the responsibility of batting of the team will be on Sehwag, Venugopal and himself and all will try to strengthen the batting in the absence of these players
 dilli ke yahaan duusare abhyaas satr ke baad finch ne kaha, ‘aapako toornament main nishchit rup se acchhee shuruyaat kerani hogi, jisase frenchiji se kaaphi dabaav kam ho jaayegaa
 It is very important for the team to be full of confidence for the middle part of the tournament because from here you can decide your path for the finals
 ’unhone kaha, ‘nishchit rup se team ke teen ahm khilaadiyon kii kami mahasoos hogi jisase jimmedaari mujh par, sahvaag or venugopal par hogi
 We will try to strengthen the batting as much as possible without these players

 What is Electoral Bonds Any donor can conceal his identity by buying Electoral Bonds worth up to one crore rupees from the State Bank of India as a donation to the political party of his choice
 ye vyavastha daankartaaon kii pahchaan nahin kholti or ise tex se bhi chhot praapt he
 Only the political party that gets at least 1 per cent of the votes in the general election can get donations from this bond
 ise bhi padhein: elactoral bond se or badi he chunavi funding main apaardarshita, videshi chanda bhi sambhavakentre sarkaar ne is daawey ke saath is bond kii shuruyaat kii thi ki isse raajnneetik funding main paardarshita badhegi or saaf-suthra dhan aayega
 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley wrote in January 2018, 'the scheme of electoral bonds has been brought to bring' clean 'money and increase' transparency 'in the system of political funding

 BJP is the biggest beneficiary! Critics say that these bonds have proved to be the biggest beneficiaries of BJP

 Advocate Prashant Bhushan, appearing for ADR, also argued that the corporate bonds and the industry are benefiting from the electoral bonds and the BJP gets 95 per cent of the donations from such bonds
 chunaav ayog ne bhi is baat ko sweekaar kiya tha ki elactoral bond se saal 2017-18 main sabase zyada 210 karod rupee kaa chanda bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ko mila he

 sarkaar ne is daawey ke saath is bond kii shuruyaat kii thi ki isse raajnneetik funding main paardarshita badhegi or saaf-suthra dhan aayega, kaale dhan par roak lagegi
 However, instead of bringing transparency, this bond has increased the risk further, not only that there is scope for donations from foreign sources as well
 chunaav ayog ne bhi apni tippaniyon main elactoral bond jaisi agyaat banking vyavastha ke jariye raajnneetik funding ko lekar andeh jaahir kiye hai
 The Supreme Court had also advised the Central Government in the hearing held on March 12 this year that the Central Government should take serious steps in this regard
 iske baad se hi elactoral bond lagaataar sawaalon ke ghere main he
 Corporate donations were encouraged due to lack of source of donations received by political parties

 sarkaar kaa kahana he ki elactoral bond main yogadan 'kisi bank ke acount pei check yaa bank khate se electronic clearing system' ke dwaara diya jaataa he
 The government also argues that these bonds have been given a random serial number which is not visible by eye
 bond jari karne vaala esbiai is serial number ke bare main kisi ko nahin bataata
 Out of the purview of the Election Commission, but the above provisions also do not remove the problems
 chanda dene vaali kii gopneeyata or raajnneetik funding main apaardarshita bani rahati he or yah sab chunaav ayog kii jaanch ke daayre se bhi baahar he
 Even after having KYC, only the bank or the government can know about the donor, not the Election Commission or any common citizen
 janpratinidhitiv kanoon (RP Act) kii dhara 29 si main badlaav karte hue kaha gaya he ki elactoral bond ke dwaara hasil chandon ko chunaav ayog kii jaanch ke daayre se baahar rakhaa jayega

 Now what is political dispute? Political controversy has started once again regarding electoral bonds
 artiai se hi yah khulaasa hua he ki rigerv bank ne elactoral bond jari karne ko lekar sarkaar ko chetaya tha
 The Reserve Bank had said that authorities issuing such instruments could be taken into effect
 isaki vajah se isamen paardarshita puri tarah se nahin rakhi ja sakati

 The glittering trophy that Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Canada's Ashish Bagai set to watch on April 2 at the Wankhede Stadium will be a replica of the genuine World Cup trophy, with none other than the previous winners
 There will be no difference
 tiimon ke bich is trophy ke liye shanivaar se jang shuru hogi, jo sone or chaandi se taiyaar kii gai he or jiskaa vajan 11 kigra he
 This trophy of the World Cup was prepared in 1999 by the workers of Gerrad & Company with great effort within two months
 gerrad and company britain ke shahi parivaar ke jewalers bhi hai

 The total length of the trophy is 60 centimeters, with a golden globe above at the support of three pillars
 trophy par lage teenon stambh ballebaaji, gendbaaji or kshetrarakshan kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai
 The names of the previous winners have been written in the lower part of this and still the names of 10 more teams can be included in it

 The ICC also decided to prepare its own trophy on the lines of FIFA for the first time in 1999 and give it to the winning team
 pehle teen vishwa cap kii praayojak prudential company thi, isliye use prudential trophy kaha gaya
 Then in 1987, when India and Pakistan hosted the World Cup, Reliance was the main sponsor and hence the trophy was named Reliance Trophy
 isi tarah se australia or newjiland main 1992 main hue vishwa cap ko bensen and hejaj vishwa cap or iske chaar saal baad 1996 main bhartiya upmahadweep main khele gaye toornament ko wills vishwa cap ke naam se janaa gaya tha
 The ICC tournament still has many sponsors, but their name does not link to the trophy or the World Cup
 ab is toornament ko isisi cricket vishwa cap or trophy ko isisi trophy kaha jaataa he

 hamane dashak kii shuruyaat main 2010 main rashtramandal khelon main mili avasar ko khub bhunaaya tha
 And the upcoming Olympics Tokyo 2020 will be very important for the future of Indian sports because like the beginning of the decade, we can achieve a big achievement at the end
 bharat ne 2010 ke rashtramandal khelon main 101 padak jite the, phir bhi logon ke dimag main is khel se judi jo yaaden shesh hai ve khel ke kuprabandhan kii hi hai; isamen hue bhrashtachar kii hai jo saarvajanik charchaa ke centre main aa gaya tha
 In fact, India won three medals in its traditionally strong fields — shooting, boxing and wrestling — at the 2008 Beijing Games
 saaf sanket tha ki bharat is dashak main khel ke kshetra main ek vaastavik rashtriya badlaav ke liye taiyaar he
 Initially things were on track
 bharat ne beijing olympic se mili lay ko barkaraar rakhaa or 2012 ke landan olympic main medal kii sankhya doguni karte hue chah padak (do rajat or chaar kaansya) jite
 The performance in London was India's best Olympic performance ever
 tab bhartiya khel main ashavad kii jhalak milane lagi thi or sambhaavnaaen dikhne lagi thim
 This was followed by a fall in the 2016 Rio Olympics

 jahaan olympic khel main ham safalataa ke nirnaayak mode par hai, vahiin cricket main bharat isse adhik majboot nahin ho saktaa
 India began the decade as the number one Test team in 2010, and bid farewell to the decade as the undisputed number one team in 2019, topping the Test Championship rankings
 haalanki bharat isisi muqablon main aisi safalataa nahin doharaa paaya, phir bhi 50 over ke praaroop main bhi hamaari team majboot dikhi
 It is very likely that he will soon do the same on home ground as he did M

 Indian cricket is looking better than before, and the best is yet to come
 haalanki, bhartiya footbal ko abhi lambii chalaang lagaani he
 For example, the Indian Super League (ISL) and U-17 World Cup started well
 rashtriya team duniya ke sheersh 100 tiimon main shaamil ho gai he, lekin nirantarata abhi bhi rashtriya team ke liye badi chunauti he
 It recently played a great game against Qatar, in which it received a lot of praise but failed to defeat Bangladesh at home and almost lost to Afghanistan in the World Cup qualifier
 kul milakar team ke saamne apane pradarshan main nirantarata banaae rakhana ek badi chunauti he
 ISL, already India's leading national tournament, will gain further strength in 2020 with the addition of traditional strong football clubs like Mohun Bagan and East Bengal
 lig ne pehle hi apane str main bahut sudhaar kiya he or bharat ke karishmai captain sunil chhetri kehete hai, ''koi vajah nahin dikhti ki ham 2026 vishwa cap main pahunch na saken
 If you look at the quality of young players in the ISL, it can definitely be said that the next decade will be ours
 '' yah vishwaas kii ek chalaang jaisaa lagata to he, lekin is tarah ke aatmavishvaas se hi bhartiya footbal ko oonchai mil sakati he
 But sadly, such hope and belief is missing in the Indian tennis world, which is badly entangled in mutual tussle and is facing a lack of new talent
 liender pes, mahesh bhupati, sania mirza or rohan bopanna apana sarvshereshth daur ji chuke hai, unke baad tennis pratibhaaon kaa baksaa khaali dikhataa he
 With Mahesh and Somdev Devvarman now retired, Sania is trying to return to take her last shot (along with Rohan) in the mixed doubles medal in Tokyo
 2019 ke ant main yah likhte samay main sabase zyada ashanvit hum nishanebaaji se
 Nine medals, including five gold at the World Cup in September in Rio and three gold in the competition in China in November, give confidence that Indian shooting is at its best and ready to contribute most to the medal list at the July 2020 Tokyo Olympics
 is
 rio (2016) main ek bhi padak nahin jeetne vaale nishanebaaji team kaa pichley do vishwa kapon main 15 padak jeetna yah darshata he ki team ne ullekhneey sudhaar kiya he or is safalataa kaa kaaphi shrey rio ke baad enarei (neshnal rifl association of india) ko junior program main abhinav bindra samiti kii siforeeshon ko prabhavi rup se lagu karne ko jaataa he
 The committee was tasked with reviewing Rio's defeat and suggesting measures for reform, the Bindra committee wrote in its report, "the committee unanimously believes that Indian shooting needs to change
" jo system he vah kaamchalaoo dikhataa he
 "the NRAI should be praised for its criticism that its chairman Raninder Singh took this criticism with good faith and corrected things
" saal 2020 bhartiya khel ke liye ek bada saal rahegaa
 The Indians will not only brighten India's name at the Tokyo Olympics, but two months after that, the Virat-led Indian team will also sing its flag in the T20 World Cup in Australia
 ummid karte hai ki bharat 2020 main sabhi khelon main twanti-20 style kaa damakham dikhaakar sabko chaunkaayegaa

 Delhi-based businessmen, along with the family, stormed into the Ramlila Maidan by locking their shops on Wednesday
 auraton or bacchon ke saath jari is pradarshan main shaamil hui mahilaon kii ek hi maang he ki ceiling se unhen aaazaad kiya jaae
 At the same time, the Supreme Court has strongly reprimanded attempts to stop the sealing through the back door
 darasal ceiling ke khilaaf andolan main ab tak to dilli ke kaarobaari morcha sanbhale hue the, lekin ab unke pariwaron ne bhi sangharsh kaa morcha tham liya he
 When the influx of women, children and elders started in Ramlila Maidan, Delhi's political leaders arose

 Due to the sealing, there is desolation in the big markets of the capital
 chaahe conot place ho yaa rajouri garden yaa karol baag, dukaanon par taale latake hai
 The Supreme Court rebuked
 The Supreme Court has slammed both the government and the traders for trying to stop the ceiling by charging conversion charges

 samaajawaadee party ke rashtriya adhyaksh mulaayam singh yadav (netaji)kaaryakartaaon se agle loksabhaa chunaav main unhen pradhanmantri banane kaa aahvaan kar chuke hai, lekin unke chote bhai or rajya ke lok nirmaan mantri shivpal singh yadav kaa maananaa he ki vidhansabha chunaav main baari jeet ke baad netaji ko mukhyamantri kii kursi sanbhaalani chahie thi
 During a conversation with Ashish Mishra, the chief correspondent of India Today, Shivpal answered the questions without any hesitation
 baatcheet ke pramukh anshkavidhansabha chunaav ke nattejey aane ke baad aisi khabaren ain ki aap akhilesh ke mukhyamantri banane ke khilaaf the
 Akhilesh is like my son
 bachapan se mere hi ghar main rahata aayaa he or aaj bhi zyaadaatar vah mere saath hi samay bitaata he
 Like a father, i also aspire to progress a lot
 akhilesh ko mukhyamantri banane ke nirnay kaa kisi ne virodh nahin kiya
 After getting an overwhelming majority, i advised Netaji to become the Chief Minister
 netaji parivaar or party ke mukhiya hai
 We value the decision they make
 bataur mukhyamantri akhilesh ke ab tak ke kaarykaal ko kaise aankate hai?akhilesh ne shandaar shuruyaat kii he
 He will undoubtedly emerge as a successful Chief Minister
 kaaphi padhe-likhe hai
 The needs of the poor, students and youth are well understood
 khaas baat yah he ki mukhyamantri banane ke baad ve or bhi vinamr va sulabh ho gaye hai
 Mulayam Singh Yadav's next target is the Lok Sabha elections
 kya aap bhi unke saath centre kii raajnneeti main utrenge?main netaji kaa sahyogi hum
 Whatever his order, i will accept, but i do not intend to do politics at the Center
 is baar vidhansabha chunaav main aapke bete ne aapke kshetra main prachaar kii kaman sambhaal rakhi thi
 Does it look like training before joining politics? My son Aditya Yadav is a final year student of Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA)
 is baar maine use apane chunaav kshetra main aane vaale jaswantnagar block kii jimmedaari saunpi thi
 But this does not mean that he will enter politics
 parivaar ke bahuterey log raajnneeti main hai
 There is no intention of bringing Aditya into politics
 mayawati ke shashan main hue bhrashtachar kii jaanch aapane jis teji se shuru kii thi, vah ab kuch dhimi padati dikh rahi he
 Other parties are alleging that the SP government has taken a soft stand towards Mayawati? In Mayawati's reign there was such an open game of corruption that a large number of bureaucracy became dishonest
 usase sahyog na mil paane se teji se jaanch nahin ho paa rahi
 It may take some time, but strict action will be taken against those involved in corruption
 agar zyaadaatar naukarshahi bhrasht ho gai he to aap apni sarkaar chalaane ke liye behatar afasar kahaan se laaenge?afasaron par hamaari paini najar he
 There are also many good officers and employees
 unhen behatar kaam ke liye protsaahit kiya ja rahaa he
 It is alleged that the SP has not one, but 3-4 Chief Ministers who work independently
 virodhiyon kaa ishaara aapaki taraf bhi he?puraa mantrimandal akhilesh yadav ke netritv main sarkaar chalaa rahaa he
 All the members do not take any decision without informing the Chief Minister
 inamen main koi apwaad nahin hum
 What is your roadmap for the upcoming Lok Sabha elections? i have important departments like Public Works Department, Irrigation, Cooperation
 meri puri koshish he ki jald-se-jald pradesh ko gaddha yukt sadakon se mukti dilaaun
 a new road of development will open as soon as the roads are repaired
 iske alaava sinchai kii band padi sarayu, sharada, bansagar pariyojna ko kendriya yojana ayog, vishwa bank ke sahyog se jald puraa karenge
 This time our government could not provide full value of the crop to the farmers, but next time this shortage will be overcome
 do saal main saare vaade puure karenge

 unhone kaha, yoga har paristhiti main jivan ko samrudh kar rahaa he, jab todane vaali takatein haaavee hoti he to bikharaav aata he to vyaktiyon or samaaj or rashtron ke bich bikharaav hota he, samaaj main vivaad badhate hai, yahaan tak ki vyakti khud hi bikharata he or jivan main tanaav badhata chalaa jaataa he
 The sum adds between this scatter
 aaj hamaari duniya main aise karodon log hai jo ki heart kii beemaari se grasit hai aise main yoga un bimariyon ko dur karne main bhi madad karata he
 He said that due to yoga, the world is moving from illness to wellness today
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ke saath yoga karne ke liye na sirf college ke vidhyaarthee alag-alag jagah se raat ke 12 baje se hi intazaar main baithe the ki get khule or wo andar jaae, balki 6 saal kii ek choti bacchee bhi is intazaar main thi ki modi ankal ke saath yoga kar sake, uski maane to modi uske netaa hai or desh ke liye acha hi kar rahe hai
 PM Modi has celebrated Yoga Day in different cities
 Let us tell you that this is the fourth Yoga Day
 isse pehle bhi pradhanmantri narendra modi ne alag-alag shaharon main jaakar yoga diwas manaaya tha
 PM Modi celebrated the first Yoga Day in Delhi, the second Yoga Day in Chandigarh, the third Yoga Day in Lucknow
 in sabhi aayojanon main bhi pradhanmantri ke saath 50,000 se adhik logon ne yoga kiya tha
 Yoga Day will be celebrated not only in India but around the world on 21 June
 aapako bataa den ki apane radio kaarykram 'man kii baat' main bhi pradhanmantri ne yoga diwas kaa zikr kiya tha
 He said that if we stay fit, India will stay fit
 " 21 june ko antarrashtriya yoga diwas se pehle unhone kaha, "main sabhi deshavaasiyon se apil karata hum ki vah apni yoga kii viraasat ko apanaaen or ek swasth, sukhad or suvyavasthit raashtra kaa nirmaan karen
 "the importance of yoga to the UN was also a historic moment
 11 disambar 2014 - united naishans kii aam sabha ne bharat dwaara pesh kiye gaye prastaav ko sweekaar karte hue 21 june ko 'antarrashtriya yoga diwas' ke rup main ghoshit kar diya
 This proposal was supported by 175 countries out of 193 and was accepted without any voting
 yuan ne yoga kii mahatta ko sweekaarte hue mana ki yoga maanav swasthya va kalyaan kii disha main ek sampurna najariya he
 The proposal, first introduced on 14 September 2014 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, passed in the UN General Assembly in less than three months
 90 dinon ke bheetar hi paas ho gaya tha yoga diwas kaa prastaavbhartiya rajdoot ashok mukherjee ne ‘antarrashtriya yoga diwas’ kaa prastaav yuan assembly main rakhaa tha, jise duniya ke 175 deshon ne bhi sah-prastaavit kiya tha
 The support received in such a large number of any proposals in the U
N
 General Assembly also became a record in itself
 isse pehle kisi bhi prastaav ko itane bade paimaane par itane deshon kaa samarthan nahin mila tha
 And this was also the first time that any such initiative was passed in the UN Assembly within 90 days by any country
 yah bhi apane aap main ek record he
 Why only on 21st June? The reason behind the making of International Yoga Day on 21st June is that the summer solstice happens on this day
 is din surya dharti kii drushti se uttar se dakshin kii ore chalanaa shuru karata he
 That is, the Sun which was till now in front of Northern Hemisphere, now starts moving towards Southern Hemisphere
 yoga ke nazariye se yah samay sankraman kaal hota he, yani roopantaran ke liye behatar samay hota he
 Heart is a major part of our body
 agar yah dhadkna band kar de to jeevanalila samaapt ho jaati he
 We have also kept many misconceptions about the heart

 chhattisgarh ke purv mukhyamantriajit jogine teesri baar you-turn liya he
 Jogi will now contest from his traditional Marwahi assembly seat

 Currently, his son Amit Jogi is a Congress MLA from Marwahi assembly seat

 Earlier, Janata Congress Chhattisgarh supremo Ajit Jogi had promised that he will contest the Vidhan Sabha against Chief Minister Raman Singh
 raman singh jis bhi vidhansabha seat se ummidavaar banenge, ve bhi usee seat se unhen chunauti denge
 But as soon as the nomination process of the first round of elections started in the state, Ajit Jogi turned away from his promise
 unhone 90 vidhansabha siton main chunaav prachaar karne kaa hawala dekar chunaav ladane se inkaar kar diya
 Two days after this denial, Ajit Jogi again backed out of his decision
 unhone marvaahee vidhansabha seat se chunaav ladane kaa elaan kar diya
 According to his son Amit Jogi, many important activists from Marwahi assembly seat called Ajit Jogi as their shortcomings
 unhone kaha ki unhen marvaahee main prachaar ke liye nahin aana padegaa kyonki wo kamiyaan he koi pratyaashee nahin
 It is the job of the people of Marwahi to win them by breaking records

 But both the leaders refused to contest the assembly elections
 iske baad pradesh congress cameti ne karunaa shukla ke naam par apni muhar lagaayee
 At present, the eyes of both BJP and Congress parties are focused on Ajit Jogi's next step

 The entire strategy has been chalked out in a meeting held at the house of former Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda
 is ranneeti ke mutabik hooda har panchayat main jaakar kisaanon ko unka haq dilaane kii baat karenge
 The start will be from Kurukshetra on 16 June
 hooda ke dilli sthit ghar par bulaai gai baithak main saikadon kii taadaad main kisaan pahunche
 Hooda says that he had just called some leaders to discuss, but the number of farmers who have come here, it is clear that the farmers are upset and looking towards the Congress
 yahaan pahunche kisaanon kii shikaayat he ki rajya kii khatter sarkaar na to kisaanon ko fasal kii puri qeemat de rahi he or na hi unhen hue nuksaan kii bharpai hi kar rahi he
 Insurance companies are also behaving arbitrarily
 in kisaanon kii maang he ki supreme court ke faisle ke hisaab se inhen tippaniyan - Get part of their water from sutlej-yamuna link - kachche tel kii giri dar ke anupaat main deazal kii dar kam ho - The support price of vegetables should also be fixed - ganne kaa samarthan mulya badhaayaa jaae or ise 400 rupee quintal kiya jaae
 Facing defeat in Haryana, the Congress is trying to find its land in the state
 ab ummid samasya jhel rahe kisaanon kii naaraazgi par ja tiki he
 Hundreds of farmers reached the meeting convened at Hooda's Delhi home
 hooda kehete hai ki inhone bas kuch netaaon ko charchaa ke liye bulaayaa tha lekin jis taadaad main kisaan yahaan pahunche, usase zaahir he ki kisaan kis qadar pareshaan hai or congress kii taraf dekh rahe hai
 The farmers who have reached here are complaining that the Khattar government of the state is neither giving the full price of the crop to the farmers nor is compensating them for the loss
 beemaa companiyaan bhi manamaane dhang se pesh aa rahi hai
 These farmers demand that according to the decision of the Supreme Court, their comments - satluj-yamuna link se inke hisse kaa pani mili - Diesel rate should be reduced in proportion to the crude oil fall rate - sabziyon kaa bhi samarthan mulya tay kiya jaae - Support price of sugarcane should be increased and it should be Rs 400 quintal
 haryana main haar kaa saamana karne vaali congress rajya main apni zamin talashne kii koshish main jute gai he
 Now hope is resting on the resentment of the farmers facing the problem
 yahaan pahunche kisaanon kii shikaayat he ki rajya kii khatter sarkaar na to kisaanon ko fasal kii puri qeemat de rahi he or na hi unhen hue nuksaan kii bharpai hi kar rahi he
