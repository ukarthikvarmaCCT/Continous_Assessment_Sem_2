 rajdhani dilli main insaaniyat kii maut kaa ek behad chaunkaane vaala maamla saamne aayaa he
 Here a husband wandered the streets for five hours carrying the corpse of his wife
 usne raah chalate logon se madad kii guhaar lagaai, magar samaaj main basii insaaniyat to jaise dam tod chuki thi
 The incident is from Anand Vihar area of delhi
 darasal somvaar shaam anju naam kii ek mahila kii ilaaj ke dauraan maut ho gai
 The woman's body was handed over to her husband, Chhote Lal
 privet ambulance se chhotelal patni ke shav ko aspataal se lekar ghar pahunchaa
 But look at the oppression, the landlord flatly refused to keep Chhotalal's wife's body in the house
 laash ambulance main padi thi
 The helpless Chhote Lal wife Keelashlekar again reached the hospital, but the society's contractors did not relieve her here either
 aspataal ke jaalim gardon ne use kuch der baad aspataal se baahar nikal jane kaa farmaan suna diya
 Three hours had passed for the corpse in an ambulance
 tabhi ambulance chaalak ne bhi paison kaa takada kiya, lekin chhotelal ke paas ambulance chaalak ko dene ke liye zyada paise nahin the
 Due to this, the ambulance driver also repeatedly kept asking Chhotalal to remove the corpse from the ambulance
 aakhirkaar ambulance chaalak bhi laash ko chhotelal ke hawaale chhod vahaan se nikal gaya
 Time passed and little Choteelal became aware of the real fraudulent faces of humanity
 jiske baad paanch ghante tak chhotelal patni kii laash lekar sadakon par ghumta rahaa
 Just then, a police team patrolling there saw him
 pulicekarmiyon ne patni ke shav ko ek ghar main rakhwane kii vyavastha kii
 Chhotalal accused his landlord of committing excesses with him
 vahiin makanamalik ne apni safai main kaha ki usne to chhotelal kii madad kii thi
 Along with this, there was also talk of incurring expenses for his wife's funeral
 baharhaal is ghatana ne chhotelal ko to sabak sikhaaya hi, saath hi samaaj ke saamne aainaa rakh uske asli chehre ko bhi benakaab kiya he

 Some recite Chalisa and some recite 'mahi Katha'
 jalwe hi kuch aise the captain sahab ke
 The one who laid his hands on it becomes a star
 jo faisla kar diya vah kehalaae master stroke
 But every cricketer's life is full of ups and downs
 upar lagi tasviir ko dekha aapane
 Actually, this view is of the Wellington Test which ended today with New Zealand
 brendan maikulam krij par date the
 Upset Dhoni called part time spinner Rohit Sharma to bowl
 unhone slip bhi lagaaya
 But everyone was stunned by his position
 slip kaa fielder us jagah khadaa tha jahaan saamanytah tej gendbaaj ke liye slip fielder hota he
 For which shot of Dhoni Fielder mccullum applied this is the subject of research
 par dhoni kii is ranneeti par sawaal uthanaa laazmi he?jaise hi 2011 main team india ne world cap jeeta dhoni desh ke mahanatam captainon kii suchi main aa gaye
 Then came the England tour
 jahaan se sabakuch badal gaya
 We learned to lose
 lagaataar haarane lage
 Been addicted to this drug
 june 2011 se ab tak bharat ne videshi dharti par kul 15 test khele hai
 Lose 10, draw 4 and win only one
 world cricket main sirf zimbabwe kaa record itnaa bura he
 Perhaps this is enough to show Mahi's greatness
 aisa nahin he ki pichley teen saalon main bharat ko jeet ke maukey nahin mili
 But Captain Saab's mysterious decisions and defensive thinking missed every opportunity
 june 2011 main lords test main team ke jeetne kii sambhaavna thi
 India's hold on the first two days of the Trentbridge Test was strong
 australia daure main melbern test ke pehle din hamane acchhee shuruyaat kii
 We were sure to win the Johannesburg and Wellington Test
 par hamane 'jeet ke munh se drow' nikaal liya
 All these matches have one thing in common, Dhoni missed important opportunities
 lords test ke chauthe din lunch tak england kaa score 72 ran par 5 wicket tha
 Ball 31 overs old
 par 40 minute baad dhoni suresh raina or harbhajan se gendbaaji kii shuruyaat karte hai
 England score 124 for 8 wickets in the Trentbridge Test
 par dhoni stuard broad or tim bresanan ke saamne defensive field lagaate hai
 On the fourth day of the Wellington Test match
 agar badhat ko hataa diya jaae to newjiland kaa score 5 wicket par 6 ran tha
 First session of the day
 gend sirf 19 over puraani
 Fast bowlers got all night's rest
 aakraamak ranneeti apnaanaa yahaan maatr ek upaay tha
 But only 7 overs, and Dhoni was dominated by defensive thinking
 team ran bachaane kii ranneeti par laut ai
 Sometimes it seems that Dhoni often forgets that runs are automatically stopped by taking wickets
 par unki ranneeti dusron se juda he
 Stop the first run, wicket will be found at one time or another
 shaayad, ye planning bhartiya pichon par chal jaae par videshi sarajameen par to ye fail he
 Mana Dhoni does not have Dale Steyn and Mitchell Johnson
 par team to vahi chunate hai
 Can not five bowlers play in playing XI? sawaal bharose kaa he
 Does Mahi have more faith in the bowlers than on his batsmen? Strategy is part of captaincy
 agar aap is mudde par fail ho jaaen to sawaalon ke ghere main aaenge hi
 In today's date, the common question is whether Dhoni should give up Test captaincy? But the important question is, does Dhoni want to captain the Test team? The question is about attitude
 jimmedaari ko enjoy karne kaa he
 It is not like seeing Dhoni
 janvari 2012 main dhoni ne ishaara diya tha ki ve 2013 ke ant tak cricket ke kisi ek formet ko alavida kah denge
 It is the month of February of 2014
 khayr! test cricket kaa to nahin pataa par captaini to chhod hi deni chahie
 There is no doubt that Dhoni is India's best wicketkeeper batsman to date
 par captain, kaise hai, iskaa jawaab sirf dhoni de sakate hai
 Record correction
 england or australia kaa daura isi saal hona he
 Or it's too late
 aajkal sijan he na vyavastha parivartan kaa
 Do you know whether Dhoni rules the wave? maharashtra ke mukhyamantri prithviraj chavaan ne pradhanmantri narendra modi se gahraate bijli sankat par vichaar-vimarsh ke liye mukhyamantriyon kii baithak bulaane kaa aagrah kiya he
 The power crisis has affected at least five states
 pradhanmantri ko bheje patr main chavaan ne kaha he ki nijee kshetra se vidyut aapurti ke liye pratispardhaa ke aadhaar par boliyon ko antim rup dene ke baad eendhan uplabdhta ko lekar kuch gambhir mudde ubhare hai
 The letter said, some legal challenges have also emerged due to changes in the law, due to which disputes have increased in the power purchase agreement
 
 
 parinamswaroop nijee kshetra ke utpaadakon ne kaam jari rakhane main asamarthta jataai he
 This has led to increased loadshedding across the state (maharashtra)
 unhone kaha he ki ganesh mahotsav ke chalate samasya or gaharaa gai he
 Chavan said that he met Union Power Minister Piyush Goyal along with NCP chief Sharad Pawar in Mumbai on August 30 to resolve the problem
 baatcheet ke dauraan yah mahasoos kiya gaya ki samasya kii vyapaktaa ko dekhte hue or iske rashtriya prabhaav ko dekhte hue maamle ko ucchtam str par sulajhane kii aavashyaktaa he

 rashtrrgan ke ye sur hyderabad ke gachibavali ilaake main pulela gopichand badminton academy ke ahaate se bahati subah kii tej hawa ko cheer rahe hai
 India's best badminton players in singing the national anthem: Saina Nehwal, Parupalli Kashyap, p
 ve
 Sindhu, RMV Gurusain Dutt and at least 20 other players are included
 saptaah main do baar ve raashtragan se prerana lete hai
 Many players touch the floor first with the hand and then with the forehead before stepping inside the academy
 is ek bhav se aap samaj sakate hai ki inamen se harek ke liye is gurukul kii kitni ahmiyat he
 If he had been a badminton player in India 10 years ago, he could not have imagined such an academy
 aaj yah sapana sach ho gaya he or iskaa sara shrey sirf ek vyakti ko jaataa he or ve hai rashtriya badminton coach pulela gopichand
 Today, 150 young badminton players are undergoing training in this academy, out of which 40 remain there
 prashikshan dene ke liye aath coach or chah sahaayak karmchaaree hai
 There is a swimming pool, health club, rehab and wellness center, a football field, running track, ice and steam bath facilities, jacuzzi and a cafeteria with eight Yonex courts
 gopichand bataate hai, “jab main khelaa karata tha to training kii behatar jagah kii talash main videsh gaya tha
 Sometimes i was refused admission
 isaki vajahah vahaan ke coach nahin chaahate the ki baahar vaale ye jaane ki unka system kaise kaam karata he
 i used to think that i wish! If we had such a place here, we would not have to stretch our hands in front of them
 ”gopichand ne 2001 main ol england khitaab jeeta tha
 The Andhra Pradesh government then gave Gopichand five acres of land in 2003 to build the academy
 lekin ise banane ke liye jaruri 13 karod ru
 Raising was really crooked for him
 gopichand ko vah baat aaj bhi yaad he, jab badi companiyon ke paas jaakar ve kehete the ki hamaare paas vishwastar ke khilaadi hai to ve hansaa karte the or kehete the ki kal aana
 And he never came yesterday
 gopichand ne teen karod ru
 Pledged his house to raise
 paanch karod ru
 The donation was given by industrialist and media owner Nimmagadda Prasad
 iske liye unhone ek tarah se shart bhi rakhi thi? ek olympic padak
 Gopichand fulfilled his promise and last year Saina Nehwal showed a bronze medal at the London Olympics
 apane khel ke dinon main gopichand khud achche kism kii shatal cock kii kami se jujhate rahe the
 At that time there was no thought of rehab or world-class training, even sponsors were equal
 aise coach bhi zyada nahin the, jinamein chini khiladinnon ke dabadabe ko khatm karvaa paane kaa madda ho
 Gopichand began teaching some children in the summer of 2003 after completing his time as a player
 tab 14 saal kii sina unheen main se ek thim
 In Saina, Gopichand saw his image — his same refusal to be terrorized by the big bangs of fighting and badminton
 gopi puri tarah sina ko sikhaane main jute gaye
 This dedication and hard work culminated in a happy moment in August last year when the Olympic bronze medal was worn on Saina's neck
 guru or shishy ne nam ankhon se landan ke vamble arena main tirangaa laharaae jate dekha
 Haryana-born Saina is not only the flag bearer of Indian badminton but her stature is also big because she has presented the most serious challenge to the high wall of Chinese badminton
 sina kaa kahana he, “unhen (gopichand ko) maaloom he ki aapako kaise training deni he, aap kahaan-kahaan kamjor hai or toornament jeetne ke liye kya-kya karnaa he
 "that is what the Guru adds," In the last nine years, i have been having every minute news about when and what she does
 aap kah sakate hai ki maine badi shiddat se uski har harakat par najar rakhi he
 Saina's success worked as a kind of revolution
 bacchon ke mata-pita academy kii taraf umad pade
 Gopi's name has become Guru Pullela 'focus' Gopichand
 is focus kii jhalak us vakt milti he jab ve aise kisi bhi bachche ko apana shargid banane se saaf inkaar kar dete hai, jo puure samay padhai karne ke saath-saath badminton khelegaa, veekend main party main bhi jayega, jo chaahe khayega or america main chhuttiyaan manayega
 The same focus is reflected in his personal loyalty to his cause
 subah sava chaar baje academy main kadam rakhane vaale gopichand pehle vyakti hote hai or unka din shaam saat baje puraa hota he
 At the age of 39 he is fully fit
 ve jujharu partner bhi hote hai or aathon cotrce main se harek main maujuud har khilaadi par baj kii tarah najar bhi tikaae rahete hai
 While teaching the 20 players practicing net smash, they strictly command: “fold your knees
 ”ab 23 saal kii ho chukin sina se lekar academy ke sabase junior khilaadi tak sab jaanate hai ki gopichand ke munh se niklaa har shabd kanoon he
 18-year-old Sindhu says, 'whatever they say, we blindly follow it
 ’ sindhu ne isi agast main china main guangajhu main vishwa championships main kaansya padak jitkar badminton kii duniya main dhamak di he
 From now on, his comparison with Saina has started
 gopichand yah spasht karte hai ki sina se sindhu kii tulana karnaa anuchit he
 Saina has won 16 major international titles
 “main nahin chahta ki sina banaam sindhu yaa sina or sindhu main koi ek jaisi sthiti bane
 i would like that Saina and Sindhu get down to compete together on the world stage
 ”bhartiya badminton ke maujuuda sitaron or agali peedi ke behtareen khiladinnon ke ek hi chat ke neeche rahane kaa sabase bada phayda yah he ki academy main prerana kaa vaataavaran hameshaa rahata he
 Emerging players get an opportunity to see and learn from their ideals all the time
 in nae chehron main chhattisgarh se aayaa 17 saal kaa sayyam bhi shaamil he
 Gopichand teaches both Sindhu and Sayyam together on the same court
 gopi ke saamne ab chunauti guruon kii aisi jamaat khadi karne kii he, jo hyderabad ke baahar bhi pratibhaaon ko khojkar unhen taraash saken
 Currently, the academy has players from Kerala, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh
 europe kii acadamiyon main har ghante abhyaas ke liye 65 euro dene padate hai lekin yahaan bharat kii sarvshereshth academy main ek khilaadi maheene main sirf 2,000 ru
 gives
 hostel main rahane vaale har maheene 5,000 ru
 Give
 gopichand apane khiladinnon ko sirf tabhi oonchi chalaang kii chhot dete hai jab smash hit lagaana hota he
 Otherwise, every disciple is fed on the ground with a knuckle
 isliye guangajhu main karnama karne ke baad der raat hyderabad lautne ke baavjood sindhu agle din bade savere court main hajir thim
 Gopichand was also present there
 maano un donon ko abhi koi adhuraa rah gaya kaam puraa karnaa ho
 When 'gopi sir' is on the court, consider the game going on
  Defense Minister AK Antony expressed concern over the increased incidents of infiltration attempts and ceasefire violations from across the border and said that this is not possible without the 'instigation' of the Pakistani Army
 antni ne ek samvaadadaata sammelan ko sambodhit karte hue kaha, ham in sabhi ghatnakramon par najar rakhe hue hai
 These types of efforts are increasing rather than attempting to prevent infiltration or minimize infiltration attempts
 iskaa matlab yah he ki aisa seemaa paar ke tatwon ke samarthan se ho rahaa he, lekin mujhe pakkaa vishwaas he ki pakistani sena ke samarthan, sahyog or jaankaree ke bina kuch nahin hota
 This is a matter of concern for us
 rakshaamantri ne hairaani jataai ki pakistan ke sashastr balon kii jaankaree yaa samarthan ke bina is prakaar ke prayaas kaise ho sakate hai, kyonki antarrashtriya seemaa kii raksha ek ore bhartiya sena or seemaa suraksha bal, to duusari ore rangers karte hai
 The Defense Minister said, the armed forces are fully guarded on both sides of the border, so how can terrorists infiltrate the Indian border without the knowledge or support of the armed forces of Pakistan? He said, this is a question, which is bothering us
 antni ne kaha ki bharat lagaataar yah kahata rahaa he ki vah pakistan ke saath sambandhon ko sudhaarney main eemaandaar he, lekin sawaal yah he ki jab ghuspaith ho rahi he, to yah kaise sambhav ho saktaa he?

 West Bengal Governor MK Narayanan has resigned on Monday after being questioned by the CBI recently
 centre main satta parivartan ke baad se hi narayanan par istipha kaa dabaav tha, lekin vah istipha na dene par ade hue the

 Narayanan was a security adviser before becoming the Governor of West Bengal
 sutron ke anusaar narayanan ne goa ke rajyapal bivi vaanchu ke saath 2005 main hui us baithak main shariq hue the, jisamen helicopter kii takneekee visheshtaon main pramukh badlaav kii anumati di gai
 For this reason, the need was felt to record the statement of Narayanan as a witness
 sibiai vaanchu kaa bhi bayaan record kar sakati he
 He has been asked to appear before the agency
 vah rajyapal banane se pehle special protection group (espiji) ke pramukh the
 The CBI had sought permission to record his statement in the context of investigating the Rs 360 crore bribery case in the deal
 pichley saal disambar main upie sarkaar ne saude ko radd kar diya tha
 The CBI has registered a case against 13 others along with former Air Force Chief SP Tyagi
 isamen tyaagi ke rishtedaar or europea bichauliya bhi shaamil hai
 There are allegations against the former Air Force chief that he had reduced the flight-height limit for the helicopter to be purchased, so that agustawestland could also be included in the bid
 tyaagi ne aaropon se inkaar kiya he
 However, the decision was taken after consultation with the SPG and the then Prime Minister's Office, including Narayanan
 agency maamle main kai naukarshahon se poochtacha kar chuki he
 This includes former Cabinet Secretary BK Chaturvedi and Comptroller and Auditor General Shashikant Sharma

 He will return to Delhi on Monday after recovering fully
 ek chikitsak ne ravivaar ko yah jaankaree di
 How Thampi, who was cough-free from cough, said Thampi at the Kejriwal Jindal Naturecare Institute, “he is recovering fast
 vah puri tarah swasth hai or khush hai, kyonki ab vah apni puraani khaansee se nijaat paa chuke hai or unka blad sugar bhi saamaanya (90-130) ke bich he
 'aam Aadmi Party convenor Kejriwal is expected to be discharged from the hospital at 2 pm on Monday after the last investigation
 saath hi unhen aage bhi swasth rahane ke liye aahaar or vyaayaam sambandhi nirdesh bhi die jaaenge
 Seeing Kejriwal's busy life, doctors have advised him to go to bed early at night to get a controlled diet, eat on time and wake up early in the morning
 aspataal main kejariwal apni maa gita devi tathaa pita govind ram ke saath tehre hue hai
 Since no medicine is given in Naturopathy, the body is freed from harmful elements through yoga activities and pranayama

 India on Saturday successfully test-fired a ground-to-air missile 'akash' missile developed with indigenous technology
 odisha main baleshwar ke nikat chandipur sthit integratid test range (itiar) se vayusena ne yah test kiya
 Defense sources said, "the modern Akash missile was fired twice from itr's complex-3 launch pad for testing
 bhartiya samyaanusaar yah test subah 11:55 or dopaher 12 baje ke bich kiya gaya
 'ITR director M
 ke
 V
 prasad ne bataaya ki vayusena dwaara kiye gaye missile ke donon pareekshan safal rahe hai
 Each missile briefly dropped the target left in the air from the second launch pad at the right time over the sea
 akaash ek medium aakaar kii sataha se hawa main maar karne vaali karne vaali missile he
 It is developed by the Defense Research and Development Organization (DRDO) under India's Integrated Guided Missile Development Program
 sutron ne bataaya ki akaash ke vayusena sanskaran ko shaamil kiya ja chukaa he
 The construction of the format used in the Army is in the final stages
 akaash 25 kilometre kii paridhi main maar karne main sakasham he
 It can carry weapons up to 60 kg with it
 yah 30 kilometre upar hawa main ud rahe kisi bhi vimaan ko bhedane kii kshamta rakhti he
 The battery in it can break multiple targets simultaneously
 yah missile hawa main udne vaale ladaaku vimaanon, krooj mixilon or hawa se sataha par maar karne vaali mixilon ko prabhaavaheen karne kii kshamta rakhti he
 Defense experts are comparing this to the MIM-104 Patriot, which hit the US surface to sky
 isse pehle akaash kaa pareekshan 24 farvari 2014 ko baleshwar se hi kiya gaya tha
 a sensational case of a farmer embracing death including family has come to light in Buldhada, Maharashtra
 buldhanda ke karwand gaanv main us samay hadakamp much gaya, jab aath saal ke ek bete ko chhodkar ek parivaar ke sabhi sadsy mrit paae gaye
 An eight-year-old child of a farmer family, who has committed suicide, is alive, who has been admitted to the hospital
 police ne kisaan, uski patni or uske chaar saal ke ek bete kii laash ko postmortem ke liye bhej diya he
 According to the information, 36-year-old Satish Vishnu Dahatonde of Karwand village of Chikhali tehsil pushed his wife and two sons into a well late Thursday evening while hanging himself from a tree and committed suicide
 mritak kisaan ke ek dost ne police ko bataaya ki guuruuvaar kii shaam uske paas satish kaa phone aayaa tha or usne bataaya ki vah aatmahatya karne ja rahaa he
 The villagers also told the police that Satish's corpse had a suspended note in it, in which he wrote that he was hanging himself by pushing three family members into the well
 aatmahatya kii baat sunakar satish ke dost ne gaanvvaalon ke saath milakar use khojna shuru kiya
 It was night searching
 tabhi gaanvvaalon ko ek kuen ke andar se kisi bachche ke rone kii aawaaj sunai di
 When people looked inside the well, Satish's eight-year-old son Kanha was struggling with life and death hanging on the pipe in the well
 police ke mutabik, satish ke paas naam maatr kaa khet tha or vah kiraanaa kii ek dukaan bhi chalaata tha
 The villagers took out Kanha hanging in the well and reported the entire matter to the police
 soochna paakar amadapur police mauka e vaardaat par pahunchi or kuen se kisaan kii patni or chaar saal ke bete ke shav bhi nikaale gaye
 Now Amadapur Police is investigating whether the mother committed suicide with her sons or the father hanged himself after pushing his family to death
 kumaar ne tanj kasate hue kaha ki najeeb jang kaa kaarykaal smaraneey nahin rahaa lekin ham shubhakamana dete hai or ummid karte hai ki centre sarkaar unhen unki seva karne ke liye puraskrit karegi or unhen jarur koi loktantric jaagir mil jaaegi
 On the other hand, Congress leader and Rajya Sabha member JP Aggarwal told NDTV that Najeeb Jung should have acted in favor of Delhi people which he did not do
 sanvaidhanik taur par unhen jo darja mila hua tha, us lihaaz se aise kai vishay the jisamen vah kade faisle le sakate the lekin unhone nahin liye
 Significantly, Najeeb Jung was appointed during the tenure of Congress but despite this his inclination was seen towards BJP
 is par agarwal ne kaha ki yah to us post par baithe vyakti par nirbhar karata he ki vah nishpakshta se kaam karnaa chahta he yaa nahin
 Jung found it appropriate to work according to the BJP, so he did
 tippaniyan At the same time, questions were also being raised about the tenure of LG Najeeb Jung, but the Home Ministry has made it clear that the time of lg's tenure is not fixed
 dilli main abhi tak bataur alji sabase lanbaa kaarykaal tejinder khanna kaa rahaa he, vahiin zyaadaatar alji ne ausatan teen saal se kam hi kaam kiya he
 As far as Najeeb Jung is concerned, he became the LG of Delhi in July 2013 and he had been in the post for three years and six months
 grahamantralay ne saaf kiya he ki najeeb jang ne apni marji se istipha diya he
 After the resignation of Najeeb Jung, the 1969 batch IAS Anil Baijal was the frontrunner for the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi, but another name has been added to the race that of j Alphons
 kis naam par muhar lagegi ise lekar beeti raat piem or grih mantri ke bich mulaaqaat bhi hui he
 Delhi may have an elected government, but the administrative command remains in the hands of LG
 aise main yah pad behad ahm ho jaataa he
 Anil Baijal has been the Home Secretary in the Vajpayee government
 dilli main didie ke vaais chayaraman rah chuke hai
 Apart from this, Prasar Bharati has also been CEO
 udhar congress netaa or rajyasabha ke sadsy rah chuke jepi agarwal ne enditivi se kaha ki najeeb jang ko dilli waalon ke haq main kaam karnaa chahie tha jo unhone nahin kiya
 Constitutionally, the status he got, there were many subjects in which he could take tough decisions but he did not take them
 gauratlab he ki najeeb jang kii niyukti congress ke kaarykaal ke dauraan hui thi lekin iske baavjood unka jhukaav bijepi kii ore dekha gaya
 On this, Agarwal said that it depends on the person sitting on that post whether he wants to work impartially or not
 jang ko bijepi ke mutabik kaam karnaa munasib laga so unhone kiya
 The comments vahiin alji najeeb jang ke kaarykaal ko lekar bhi sawaal uth rahe the lekin grahamantralay ne saaf kiya he ki alji ke kaarykaal kaa samay tay nahin hota he
 Tejinder Khanna has the longest tenure as LG in Delhi so far, while most lgs have worked less than three years on average
 jahaan tak najeeb jang kaa sawaal he to vah july 2013 main dilli ke alji bane the or unhone is pad par bane teen saal chah maheene ho gaye the
 The Ministry of Home Affairs has made it clear that Najeeb Jung has resigned on his own terms
 najeeb jang ke istife ke baad dilli ke up-rajyapal ke liye 1969 batch ke IAS anil baijal kaa naam sabase aage chal rahaa tha, lekin is res main ek or naam jud gaya he ke je alfons kaa
 There has also been a meeting between the PM and the Home Minister last night regarding which name will be stamped
 dilli main bhale hi chuni hui sarkaar ho, lekin prashasnic kaman alji ke haath main rahati he
 In such a situation, this position becomes very important
 anil baijal vaajapeyi sarkaar main grih sachiv rahe hai
 DDA has been the Vice Chairman of Delhi
 iske alaava prasar bharti main siio bhi rahe hai

 akhilesh ko nahin de sakaa koi chunauti90 ke dashak main siyasat main rakhaa kadamgandhi parivaar kii neend kar di thi haraamryabareli main yun banaai siyaasi pakadrybareli kii raajnneeti or dabangai main pichley teen dashak se betaj badshaah rahe akhilesh singh ne har tarah kii lahar, daanv or siyasat ko apane saamne bouna sabit kar diya tha
 Akhilesh Singh died on Tuesday morning at PGI, Lucknow
 wo lambey samay se cancer se peedit the
 Let us tell you that there was a time when the poor man got relief and relief in shelter from Akhilesh Singh, on the other hand, the civilized, educated and money-rich people of the city used to fear this name
 subhash chandra bose ko vah apana adarsh maanate the
 They believed that Subhash Chandra Bose was not killed in a plane crash, he is still alive
 iske liye unhone vidhansabha tak main aawaaj uthaai thi
 As soon as dawn, people started coming to him for help, Akhilesh Singh used to help everyone with an open heart
 akhilesh singh sirf apane vidhansabha kshetra hi nahin balki raibareli ke duusare ilaake ke garibon kii madad karne se peeche nahin rahete
 Because of this, she used to speak in Rae Bareli
 akhilesh singh kii raajnneeti main send maarane kii koshish karne vaale na jane kitne naam itihaas main dafan ho gaye
 Akhilesh Singh kept money, power and politics as his slave
 yahi vajah rahi ki gandhi parivaar bhi akhilesh singh kii siyasat ko raibareli main maat nahin de sakaa
 Akhilesh could not challenge any Ram Janmabhoomi movement in the politics of Uttar Pradesh, or the wave of Gandhi family in Rae Bareli or the slogans of socialism and Bahujan Hitay, Akhilesh Singh has been a long time Sadar MLA on his own
 itnaa hi nahin modi lahar main jab desh se lekar pradesh tak main camel khil rahaa tha to raibareli main akhilesh singh ne apni beti aditi singh ko chunavi maidan main utarkar saare sameekaran ko dhwast kar diya or ricard maton se jitakar vidhansabha bheja
 Akhilesh Singh started his political journey in the 90s from the Congress in the 90s
 ve kareeb 24 saal tak raibareli sadar seat se vidhayak rahe
 Even while in Congress, Akhilesh kept all the veteran leaders dwarfed with him
 akhilesh singh 13 saal tak congress se alag rahe
 During this time, he used to curse the Gandhi family
 1999 main jab captain satish sharma raibareli seat se chunaav ladane aae to akhilesh singh ke virodh se unki neend haraam ho gai thi
 After this, the top leadership of the Congress came forward and sacked Akhilesh Singh
 2002 main rakesh pandeya kii hatya ke baad akhilesh singh ko congress se baahar kar diya gaya tha
 After the Gandhi family was put to sleep, in 2004, when Sonia Gandhi came to contest from Rae Bareli seat, Akhilesh Singh had harassed the Congress leaders by fielding his cousin elder brother Ashok Singh
 priyanka gandhi 2004 main apni maa sonia gandhi ke chunaav prachaar ke liye akhilesh singh ke ilaake se gujarin to sadaken suuni padi thim or dur-dur tak koi najar nahin aa rahaa tha
 After this, Priyanka Gandhi had camped in Rae Bareli, after which Sonia was able to win
 akhilesh singh kaa khauf aisa tha ki congressi unke dar se poster bhi nahin laga pate the
 The Gandhi family used several pieces to beat Akhilesh Singh from the Sadar seat of Rae Bareli, but not a single one was successful
 congress netaaon ne akhilesh ko haraane ke liye satta or dhan sabakaa istemaal kiya, lekin akhilesh singh jail main rahete hue bhi nirdaleey ummidavaar ke taur par chunaav jeet gaye
 Akhilesh had deep roots in the politics of deep penetration in the region that it was not easy for the opponents to overthrow him
 vah ek bahubali netaa ke rup main jane jate the
 His name in the world of crime came when Anand Mishra was killed in 1985
 iske baad 1987 main manoj trivedi urf badshaah kii hatya main bhi unka naam aayaa
 After this incident, his unitary rule was established over the entire district
 jile main jisane bhi sar uthaane kii koshish kii use itihaas bana diya gaya
 On July 23, 1988, Syed Modi, a Batminton player, was killed
 is hatyakand main bhi akhilesh singh kaa naam aayaa, lekin is ghatana ke baad se jile ke baahar bhi unki tuuti bolne lagi
 However, as has happened, even the strongest steel poles start rusting after an age, Akhilesh Singh too had a similar situation
 wo lambey samay se cancer se peedit the, jiske chalate unka raajnneetik varchasv bhi kam ho gaya tha

 asina maas ke krishna paksh kii ekadshi ko indira ekadshi kaha jaataa he
 Lord Vishnu is worshiped on this auspicious day and many types of suffering are overcome by observing this fast
 kyon khaas he yah ekadshi vratpitrupaksh kii ekadshi hone ke kaaran yah ekadshipitaron kii muktike liye uttam maani ja rahi he
 This Ekadashi celebrated on Pitrupaksha liberates the fathers and their soul is relieved in other worlds
 kya he is vrath kaa mahatvapuraanon ke anusaar indira ekadshi vrath, sadhak kii mrityu ke baad bhi prabhavit karata he
 Due to this effect, all the sins of a person are destroyed and by the effect of this fast, one gets heaven
 is vrath ke prabhaav se jataka ke pitaron kaa dosha bhi samaapt hota he
 The fast story of Indira Ekadashi
 
 
 satyuga ke samay mahishmati naam kii nagari main indrasen naam kaa ek pratapi raja dharmpurvak apni praja kaa paalan karte hue rahata tha
 He was endowed with Raja Putra, grandson and wealth etc
 and was a great devotee of Lord Vishnu
 ek din jab raja apni sabha main baitha tha to akaash maarg se maharishi naarad utarkar uski sabha main aae
 The king stood with folded hands on seeing them and worshiped them
 unhone devarshi naarad se unke aane kaa kaaran poocha
 Then Narada Muni said - o Rajan! You listen carefully to my words
 main ek samay brahmalok se yamalok ko gaya, vahaan shraddhapurvak yamraj se poojit hokar maine dharmsheel or satyawan dharmraj kii prashansa kii
 In the meeting of the same Yamraj, the great learned and righteous saw your father because of the fast of Ekadashi
 unhone sandeshaa diya vah main tumhen kahata hum
 He said that due to any disturbance in his previous life, i am staying near Yamraj
 isliye he putr yadi tum asina krishna indira ekadshi kaa vrath mere nimitt karo to mujhe swarg kii prapti ho sakati he
 Hearing the talk of Naradji, the king fasted with his bandhas and slaves, due to whose virtuous effect the king's father climbed Garuda and went to Vishnulok
 raja indrasen bhi ekadshi ke vrath ke prabhaav se nishkantak rajya karke ant main apane putr ko singhaasana par baitaakar swarglok ko gaye
 What is the method of this fast- According to the Padma Purana, the rules of Ekadashi fasting are observed from Dashami Tithi, in which once food, celibacy is to be followed
 - agle din yani ekadshi vrath ke din snanadi se pavitra hokar vrath sankalp lenaa chahie
 To take blessings of fathers, the Brahmin should give food and Dakshina after performing rituals
 - pitaron ko diya gaya ann-pind gaay ko khilaanaa chahie
 Then there is the law to worship Lord Vishnu with incense, flowers, sweets, fruits etc
 - uske baad agle din yani dwadashi tithi ko pun: pujan kar brahmanon ko bhojan karwaakar, parivaar ke saath maun hokar bhojan karnaa chahie

 At the same time, some villagers, including women, tried to stop the demonstrations of the workers

 At the same time, policemen engaged in Anna's protection also tried to pacify the workers
 iske baad pavaar samarthak dharne par baith gayi
 Anna's colleague Suresh Pathare has condemned this protest by NCP workers
 unka maananaa he ki pavaar samarthak ‘nautanki’ kar rahe hai
 He said that the youth involved in the demonstration were visiting Anna till yesterday
 pavaar ko chaanta padane par anna ne patrakaron ke saamne kaha tha, ‘bas ek hi maaraa’’? halaki baad main unhone is ghatana kii ninda kii thi
 After this, Anna came in front of the people and gave clarification
 unhone kaaryakartaaon ko bataaya ki vah pehle hi pavaar par hamale kii ninda kar chuke hai
 Hazare also asked NCP workers why they are getting so angry
 His question was that when the farmers get lathicharge, why do the NCP workers not get angry? hamaari duniya ke awwal scientist ke taur par oinstin or newton ko janaa jaataa he, lekin oinstin jaise scientist jis shakhsiyat kii tasviir apane teble par rakhkar prerana lete the

 i want to tell the readers a few things of which Chand is very impressed with my son's perspective with whom i watched the matches and who is probably very much aware of football at the age of 14
 chaliye do baton ke saath shuru karte hai: pehla, spain ke liye ek yug kaa ant; doosraa, brazil kii jaaduugari kaa ant
 Spain's period of domination in the football world was short and came too late in the long history of the game
 yah samay tha varsh 2008-14 kaa jis dauraan do european championsship ke alaava ek vishwa cap (2010 main dakshin africa main) yojit hua
 When Spanish was spoken in the world, Barcelona flared at the European club level

 Barcelona lost their shine last time, and this time Spain was badly defeated despite the players from the Catalan club and playing in the same style

 Several days before the inaugural match, my son and i looked at the list of World Cups and predicted the likely teams to reach the quarter-finals
 hamaara akalan ek ko chhod kar sahi rahaa: hamane costa rika kii bajaae italy ko chunaa tha
 The semifinals reached the same teams that have done consistently well: Germany (three-time winner) vs
 Brazil (five-time winner); Argentina (two-time winner) vs
 Netherlands (reached the final three times)
 italy ke saath ye timen, footbal kii 'mahashaktiyon’ ke samooh kaa sthai hissaa hai
 But no one seems to mind
 anya deshon kii is tarah kii tiimon ke pratinidhitiv ko lekar koi shor-sharaaba nahin hota
 Why are you Teams in Asia and Africa have enjoyed their share of the World Cup in the same way that they get in most World Cup events; But they were not just exciting moments, they were fleeting memories in which the unfortunate team wants to embrace a few moments of honor before kneeling before the 'superpowers'
 final ke liye ulti ginati shuru ho chuki he
 Argentina reached the World Cup final match with Germany for the third time
 jo yah kahana chaahate hai ki germany ko jeetna chahie, unhen main ek hi shabd se aagaah karuunga: messi
 He has done very well and showed us the brilliant goals
 shuruyaat main team kaa khaas saath na milane kii vajah se unke pradarshan par asar padaa tha par unamem khel kaa rukh palatney kii kshamta he

 De Maria is a very smart and attractive player and if he recovers from his injury until the final, this South American team with a sky blue and white jersey will be in a position to give Germany a tremendous fight

 unki raksha pankti main aise-aise dhurandhar bhare hai ki acchhee-khaasi safalataa ke baavjood argen robin, wesli sneder or robin vine percy ke liye mauka hi nahin
 It is unthinkable for any other team to ignore such a player like Robben
 robin ko match ke 99wein minute main extra time ke 9wein minute main kahin jaakar gol post par nishaanaa saadhane kaa mauka mil paata he
 On the other hand, Germany has its own specialties and this team is the most complete team of this World Cup

 The image of Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot as a Gandhian has been washed away by facts acquired under the Right to Information

 Similarly, the government's reply on an RTI by journalist Milapchand Dandia revealed that both the Raje and Gehlot governments together spent about Rs 4 crore on the release, movement and security arrangements of retired Judge Anshuman Singh of the High Court of Gujarat and Rajasthan

 ''raaje ne aaraam kii jindagi jeene ke kisi ke adhikaar ke khilaaf shaayad hi kabhi bolaa ho
 On the other hand, in February 2010, Gehlot gave a special speech on the importance of austerity at a public function in Jaipur: "my heart cries when going to weddings where a wedding card is Rs 2,000

 Despite this, by whose order in the account of the creation of government money started to go

 Defending champion Vidarbha took seven wickets for 200 runs
 saurashtra ke liye toss ganvaana acha sabit hua, jisane vidarbha ke sabase mahatvapurn ballebaaj jafar (23) or captain faij fazal (16) ke wicket saste main jhatakane main safalataa hasil kii
 Saurashtra bowlers especially Unadkat (2 wickets for 20 runs) and their fast bowler partner Chetan Sakaria (1 wickets for 13 runs) kept the opposition batsmen in trouble by bowling tightly
 unadakat apni line evam length main bilkul sateek rahe, jabaki sakaaria ne gend ko swing karakar or movement se ballebaajon ko mushkil main daalaa
 The defending champions have struggled to secure a partnership and would not have been in trouble if the 57-run partnership for the seventh wicket between Akshay Wadkar (45) and Akshay Karnavera (31 not out) would have been difficult
 uske ballebaaj kuch zyada hi satark dikhe
 Only Ganesh Satish (32) and Wadkar took shots during their short but crucial innings
 mohit kaale (126 gend main 35 ran) ko bhi acchhee shuruyaat mili, lekin vah ise badi pari main tabdeel nahin kar paae
 Karnewar, who came in to bat at number eight, made some breathtaking shots in the final session
 saurashtra kii team ab is maukey kaa puraa phayda uthaanaa chaahegi, kyonki use pichley saat satr main do baar up vijeta rahakar santosh karnaa padaa tha
 Sakariya got only one wicket, though he was unfortunate that Jaffer survived lbw's appeal on his ball and that too in the end
 lekin nishchit rup se vah din ke sarvshereshth gendbaaj rahe
 He bowled 14 overs, but lost only 13 runs
 prerak mankad (27 ran dekar ek wicket), dharmendrasingh jadeja (72 ran dekar ek wicket) or kamalesh makvaana (46 ran dekar ek wicket) ne ek- ek wicket chatkaaye
 Despite it being a Sunday, the stands were empty, only a few students were seen cheering for the home team

 The real cause of death will be known after investigation report
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki 65 saal ke raamacharan munda ne teen-chaar dinon se khaanaa nahin khaaya tha
 Because the family had not received ration for three months
 ghar par teen dinon se ann kaa ek dana bhi nahin tha
 Not only this, the stove was not burned in the house for a few days
 haalanki adhikari is baat se inkaar kar rahe hai ki maut bhukh se hui he

 "it is being told that the local dealer distributing the ration did not distribute the ration for three months using the network as an excuse

 SDM has given clarification on this entire matter by tweeting
 maut kii khabar media main aate hi aanan-fanan main prashasan madad ke liye aage aayaa
 The families of Ramcharan Munda were given grain and money for cremation
 munda kii maut jaanch kaa vishay he
 But if Munda died of hunger, it raises a question mark over the functioning of government machinery

 The court sentenced Kandil's brother Muhammad Waseem to life imprisonment while acquitting all his other suspects, including another brother Aslam Shaheen, another relative Haq Nawaz and Maulvi Abdul Kavi
 is maamle main kul 35 gavaahon ne apane bayaan darj karwaae
 Baloch's brother Wasim confessed to the crime and said that his sister had hurt the family's reputation with her statements and videos on social media

 His appeal was turned down by the court

 She was often dominated in the media due to her bold style and controversy
 parivaar ko unka andaaz pansad nahin tha, jiske chalate kandil baloch ke bhai ne uski hatya kar di thi
 Jio News reported that brother Wasim held Kandeel's hands and feet, while Haq Nawaz strangled him
 khabar main yah bhi kaha gaya he ki hatya se pehle sandigdhon ne use or uske abhibhavakon ko koi nashila padaarth khilaa diya tha

 Human Resource Development Minister Smriti Irani announced this in an event organized by the Confederation of Indian Industry, CII
 unhone kaha ki is abhiyaan kaa makasad yah hoga ki desh se baahar chaatro ke palaayan ko roka jaae
 He said, 'we all know that the Prime Minister has talked about' Make in India 'and we want to start' Think in India 'under the National Innovation Scheme in the Ministry of Human Resource Development
 smriti ne kaha ki is kadam ke jariye mantralay chaatro ko innovations or nae dizin ke saath saamne aane ke liye protsaahit karnaa chahta he
 The minister said that we also hope that the ministry can come up with ideas about how these innovations can be rewarded and how funds can be provided in our country itself while keeping pace with the industry

 The Nitish government, which has announced complete liquor ban in Bihar and looted accolades and won elections, is now preparing itself to sell foreign liquor in the state
 sarkaar kii nai sharaab niti ko lekar vibhageeya chitthee bhi jari ho chuki he
 In fact, the Commissioner of Excise and Prohibition Department of Bihar has written a letter to all the Assistant Excise Commissioners of the state on 15 December, showing the possibility that the government is now moving towards opening a foreign liquor shop
 utpaada ayukta ne adhikariyon ko BSBCL ko godaam or khudara dukaan kholane ke liye bhoomi uplabdh karaane kaa nirdesh diya he
 Along with the letter, a list has also been issued on this side, in which it is proposed to open how many shops in which district of the state
 mukhyamantrinithish kumaaraki ghoshnaa se itar is chitthee ke saamne aane ke baad rajya main purna sharabbandi ko lekar sawaal uthne lage hai
 This thing has also come to the fore when Good Governance Babu said after taking oath of the post of CM that there is no doubt about the complete prohibition in the state
 
 
 
 So, only after the ban on departmental letter comes in front of the country, those reports have got solid ground, which said that the Bihar government is preparing to ban only country liquor in the state
 exise vibhaag ne bhi is ore jo prastaav taiyaar kiya he, usamen sirf desi sharaab par bain kaa zikr he
 Actually, if there is a complete ban on liquor in the state then the government will incur a revenue loss of Rs 4000 crore
 vahiin, agar taaja niti kii baat kii jaae to nitish sarkaar ab videshi sharaab ko holcel ke saath retail main bhi bechegi
 The Excise Commissioner has ordered that BSBCL godowns and shops should be opened wherever the Excise Department has land
