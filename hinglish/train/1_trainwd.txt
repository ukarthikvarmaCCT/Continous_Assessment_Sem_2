 In March this year, the demand grew so fast that the hospital's renowned cardiologist, Dr
 omshankar ke netritv main doctor andolan par utar aae
 The doctors registered a symbolic protest against the lack of basic facilities in the hospital by planting opds under the trees
 doctoron or chaatro ne prastaav paas kiya ki ve har haal main biechayu main ames chaahate hai
 But AIIMS was not made but Dr
 omshankar or unke sahyogi dow
 The movement was crushed by Raviranjan's suspension
 isaki vajah yah thi ki khud biechayu ke kulapati or padmashri se sammanit prakhyat vaigyanik pro
 Lalji Singh was adamant about not allowing AIIMS to become behind the scenes
 india today ko pradhanmantri karyaalay, kulapati karyaalay or rashtriya yojana ayog ke bich farvari, 2013 se janvari, 2014 ke bich hue patr vyavhaar se pataa chalaa ki swasthya mantralay, maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantralay or yojana ayog banaras main ames banane ko raji the, lekin pehle ames kii maang karte aa rahe kulapati baad main apane hi prastaav ke virdohi banate chale gaye
 AIIMS pleaded with pmthis entire event started on February 12, 2013 Vice Chancellor Prof
 lalji singh ke tatkaaleen pradhanmantri dow
 It comes from a sentimental and thoughtful letter written to Manmohan Singh
 patr main kulapati ne biechayu main ames banane kii purajor vakaalat kii, ‘‘jaisaaki aap jaanate hi hai ki desh kaa yah ilaaka pichhadaa hua he or yahaan swasthya sevaaon kii haalat khasta he

 "he also reminded the Prime Minister," Our institute is called AIIMS of Purvanchal
 main aapke sangyaan main laana chahta hum ki bharat sarkaar santhaan ko apgrade kar ames banane kaa prastaav laai thi, lekin prastaav par kabhi amal nahin hua
 He concluded his letter with the talk of granting AIIMS status to the medical college at the earliest
 unhone isi tarah kaa ek patr yojana ayog ko bhi likhaa tha
 The Ministry of Health, HRD and Planning Commission had been done
 The proposal of Rajikulapati was widely discussed in the Central Government and on December 6, 2013, the Joint Advisor to the Human Resource Development Branch of the National Planning Commission, Dr
 pitam singh ne maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantralay ke ucch shiksha vibhaag ke sachiv ashok thakur ko patr likhaa
 The letter opened the doors for the establishment of AIIMS in Kashi, "the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has informed that it is ready to bring IMS-BHU under the purview of the revised AIIMS Act, provided the academic and administrative control of BHU Medical College Leave it
 ’’ echaradi mantralay ne bhi rajamandi dete hue kaha ki agar biechayu aisa karnaa chahta he to use medical college ko swasthya mantralay ke niyantran main dene main koi dikkat nahin he
 Recognizing their decades-old demand to the Purvanchal very easily, the letter further said, "both the Ministries agree on the proposal to upgrade IMS-BHU to the status of AIIMS and the Planning Commission also supports it, hence The Ministry is requested to take appropriate decisions in this matter
 ’’or ames ke khilaaf kulapati!yojana ayog ke is offis memorondom ke baad kaashi main mithaiyaan bantni chahie thim or sabase zyada khush khud kulapati ko hona chahie tha, jinhone is prastaav ko aage badhaayaa tha
 The becoming of AIIMS meant that Sir Sunder Lal Hospital for which at this time Rs 21,450 per bed

 Used to be per bed

 In these eight months, the Vice Chancellor realized that he might have made a big mistake by writing this letter
 dow
 Says Om Shankar, "in the present system, the vice-chancellor is the surveyor of bhu's medical college and hospital

 If AIIMS is formed then they will not have any administrative rights in it
 aise main aspataal ko apni jaagir samajhane vaale kulapati kaa man palat gaya

 It said, "the Planning Commission had informed the vice-chancellor that the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare agreed to bring IMS-BHU under the revised AIIMS Act, provided BAU relinquished administrative and academic control of the Medical College, although the vice-chancellor informed They did not agree with this proposal
 ’’patrachaar par kulapati khamoshin saare patron or ames ke nirmaan par india today ne kulapati kaa rukh jaanane kii lagaataar koshish kii

 phone par unase baat hui to unhone offis se epointment lene ko kaha, lekin kai baar yaad dilaane ke baavjood khabar likhe jane tak na to epointment mila or na hi unka koi uttar
 On the other hand, the Director of the Medical College, Prof
 rana gopal singh is vivaad se pallaa jhadate hue kehete hai, ‘‘ham sab chaahate hai ki ames bane

 Sushil Modi said that Sharad Yadav, who started his politics from the JP movement against corruption, is supporting the corruption of the Lalu family today

 Now the police is trying to find out
 ki bachche kii maut pani main girane se hui yaa pani main girane se pehle?-input bhashaa If you too spend earphones on your ear to spend free time listening to songs, then be cautious
 aapkaa aisa karnaa aapako biimaar bana saktaa he
 Yes, whether it is to work while listening to songs in the office or to go for a walk with earphones on your ear, your favorite earphones are not your friend, the enemy
 yearphone lagane se na sirf aapako kaan par bura asar padataa he balki aapaki sehat ko bhi nuksaan uthaanaa padataa he
 Let's know how
 bahraapan-ek study ke anusaar yadi koi vyakti do ghante se zyada samay ke liye 90 decible se adhik aawaaj main gane sunata he, to wo bahrepan kaa shikaar hone ke alaava kai badi bimariyon kii chapet main aa saktaa he
 Actually, the ear has a hearing capacity of only 90 decibels, which reduces to 40 to 50 decibels over time by listening to songs continuously
 jisaki vajah se vyakti ko dur kii aawaaj sunai nahin detii
 Heart disease - Hearing songs in a loud voice not only damages the ears but also the heart of the person
 tej awaaj main gane sunne se heart beet tej ho jaati he or vah narmal speed ke mukaable teji se dhadkane lagata he
 Due to which the heart can be damaged

 Because of which he starts having problems with headaches or sleeplessness
 kaan kaa sankraman-agar aap bhi offis yaa ghar par gane sunate samay ek duusare ke saath apane yearphone share karte hai to aisa karne se bachein
 Doing so greatly increases the risk of infection in your ear
 kaan sunn hona-lambey samay tak yearphone se gane sunne par vyakti ke kaan sunn ho sakate hai
 Because of which the ability to listen can decrease with time
 tej aawaaj main gane sunne par na sirf sunne kii kshamta par asar padataa he balki kai maansik samasyaayein bhi paidaa hone lagati he
 According to doctors, the use of earphones more often causes symptoms like tingling, dizziness, sleepiness, head and ear pain etc
 in the ears
 upaay-agar aap bhi kaan se judi pareshaaniyon se bachane chaahate hai to yearphone kaa istemaal jarurat padane par karen
 Use only good quality earphones instead of the earphones

 pyaar ek khubasurat ehsaas he jo sirf mahasoos kiya ja saktaa he, or jab aapke man main kisi ke prati yah ehsaas paidaa hota he to aapako uski har cheez se pyaar ho jaataa he
 You make that person an important part of your life
 uske saath apane jivan se judi har choti badi baat share karne lagate hai
 With this, you are so lost in love with each other that you do not matter how much age difference between you and your partner
 haalanki hamaare samaaj main ek aam dharna he ki rishte main ladkiyaan-ladakon se choti honi chahie
 But have you ever thought that if a boy is younger than a girl or a girl is much smaller than a boy, then how is that relationship? aaie jaane:zyaadaatar logon ko lagata he ki kisiumradraj shaksase shaadi karne ke peeche us vyakti ke paise or royal lifestil vajah hoti he
 But this is not necessarily the case
 jab tak aap aapane partner ke saath khush hai aapako samaaj kii parvaah karne kii jarurat nahin he
 However, in a relationship, there is more age difference between the boy and the girl and if their maturity level is not equal then it can increase the tension in the relationship
 partner ke bichazyada umr kaa faasalahone ke kaaran do logon kii soch main bhi kaaphi antar hota he
 Family may also be affected due to more age gap between partners
 kyonki aage jaakar rishte main bandhe zyada umr vaale vyakti ko lag saktaa he ki wo boodha ho chukaa he or ab uski bachche paidaa karne kii umr nahin rahi he
 Let me tell you that age does not exceed love in a relationship
 agar aap donon ke man main ek duusare ke prati pyaar, vishwaas he, or aap donon ek duusare ko baraabar kaa sammaan dete ho to aapke rishte main kabhi bhi kadavaahat nahin aegi
 Also, never let the age gap between you and your partner come
 balki apane rishte ko behatar banane main dhyaan den
 BJP does not rise against Kuldeep Singh Sengar
 The Rajput caste of the entire state has the support of the CBI, they have again registered a new FIR against the accused and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar
 is exiaar main rape peedita kii hatya kii koshish samet kai dharaaen lagaai hai
 In the car accident on Sunday, the rape victim, her aunt, aunt and lawyer were on board
 mausi or chachee kii maukey par hi maut ho gai jabaki vakil or peedita jindagi kii jang lard rahe hai
 Kuldeep Singh Sengar, an MLA from Bangarmau in Unnao district, was arrested by the CBI in the month of August last year under IPC and 4 sections of the Poxo Act and has been in jail since then
 uttar pradesh main hue itane bade haadase ne puure desh ko jhakzor diya he
 BJP UP president Swatantra Dev Singh had claimed that Sengar had already been suspended from the party, but no such news of the time was present in which it was mentioned
 mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ne bhi is maamle par abhi tak kuch nahin kaha he
 Now he has been expelled from the party, but is it because of his strong vote bank that the BJP remained silent for so long
 aakhir itani der khamosh kyon rahi bhaajapa ?india today data intelligence unit ne kuldeep senger kii raajnneetik pari kaa vishleshan kiya or paaya ki na sirf senger kaa vot bank pichley 17 saal main badha he balki saal dar saal wo apni pakad majboot karte gaye
 Sanger has contested from Unnao constituency 4 times on three party tickets in the last 17 years and has won each time
 2002 main unhone basapa kii tikat se unnav vidhansabha chunaav ladaa or maatr 24 pratishat vot paakar bhi ve jeet gaye
 In 2007, he contested Bangarmau assembly election on a Samajwadi Party ticket and won with 28 percent votes
 2012 main unhone ne phir sapa ke tikat se chunaav ladaa or bhagwantnagar vidhansabha main 33 pratishat vot hasil kar jite
 In 2017, he contested the Bangarmau assembly election on a BJP ticket and won with 43 percent votes
 do din pehle congress kii rashtriya mahasachiv priyanka gandhi ne bhi bhaajapa sarkaar par senger ko bachaane kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 Priyanka tweeted, 'why do we put the strength and protection of power in the hands of people like Kuldeep Sengar and why leave the victims alone to fight?' But it would not have been so kind
 lekin DIU ne paaya ki senger kii vidhansabha us party ko to vot karti hi he jisase ve chunaav ladate hai lekin unki padosi vidhansabha ke voter bhi unheen kii party ko jeetaate hai
 The Unnao Lok Sabha has six assemblies - Unnao, Bangarmau, Bhagwantnagar, Purva, Safipur and Mohan
 mohan vidhansabha 2012 main dlimitesan ke baad bani thi isliye hamaare paas is vidhansabha ke aankade 2012 ke baad ke hi uplabdh he
 When Sengar contested from the BSP in 2002, the BSP won three of Unnao's five assembly seats
 2007 main jab senger ne samaajawaadee party se chunaav ladaa tab unnav kii paanch vidhansabha siton main se chaar siton par sapa jiti thi
 Sanger again contested from SP in 2012 and this time SP won 5 out of six seats
 2002 se lekar 2012 tak hue teenon chunaavon main unnav kshetra se bhaajapa ek bhi seat darj na kar pai thi lekin 2017 main kaaya palat gai
 In 2017, when Sengar contested from BJP ticket, BJP won all the six seats of Unnao
 ghatata campaticansirf vot hi nahin senger apni vidhansabha main chunavi mukaable ko kamjor bhi kar diya he
 The DIU used enop-effective number of parties (the number of seriously contested parties) to measure the contest
 ENOP se darasal yah pataa chal jaataa he ki mukhya rup se ek chunaav kshetra main kitni partiyaan ladi thim
 It is extracted from a formula
 hamane apane vishleshan ke liye ashoka vishvavidhyalay ke trivedi centre for polytical data ke lokdhaba aplicshan kaa istemaal kiya he
 Kuldeep Singh Sengar's strengthening vote bank, ENOP will be more in the assembly, there will be more parties fighting seriously
 2002 main jab senger ko sirf 24 pratishat voton se jeet mili thi, tab ENOP 5
 Was 26, meaning more than 5 candidates were seriously contesting from Unnao Assembly at that time
 2007 main bangaramau (jahaan se senger ne chunaav ladaa) vahaan kaa ENOP 5 tha
 This ENOP in Bhagwantnagar decreased to 4 in 2012
 5 hua or 2017 main yah ghatakar 3
 03 left - meaning now only 3 parties are seriously contesting there where Sanger is very strong
 jaat-paat kii batsenger, rajput jati se hai or unke thakur netaaon se rishte majboot hai
 The opposition has also been accusing Yogi of having a special affection for Thakurs
 is kshetra main taqatvar netaa hone kii vajah se bhaajapa senger ko kinare karne se ab tak bachati aa rahi thi
 Unnao Lok Sabha MP Sakshi Maharaj proved this when he went to meet Sengar in Sitapur Jail in June only after the Lok Sabha elections were over
 media ko unhone tab kaha tha ki ve kaaphi lambey samay se jail main band hai
 Sanger is a very popular MLA, so i came to thank him after the elections
 unki is mulaakaat ko basapa supremeo mayawati ne mangalvaar ko khub latada or apane twit main unhone iskaa zikr bhi kiya
 But in this tweet, Mayawati also did not take Sengar's name and was seen targeting Sakshi Maharaj
 big bos 7 ke ghar se baahar aae armaan kohli ne aaj tak se khaas baatcheet main kaha ki ve agle saal matlab 2014 main shaadi karne kaa plan bana rahe hai
 So is it understood that he will marry Kaloj's sister Tanisha Mukherjee, who is currently in Bigg Boss house? Because the relationship between the two in the Bigg Boss house was very sweet and the kind of news that came out of the house at least indicates this
 shaadi ke bare main ek sawaal par armaan ne kaha ki ve ab 40 saal ke ho chuke hai or unhen lagata he ki shaadi ke liye yah umr sahi he
 However, he did not reveal who the girl he is about to marry
 haalanki armaan kohli ne kaha, 'tanisha or main mahaj achche dost hai or yah afvaah he ki main or tanisha big bos ke ghar main kuch galat harakatein karte hue pakade gaye the
 'armaan Kohli expressed confidence that only Tanisha will win the show
 bataa den ki kuch din pehle ek website ne armaan or tanisha kii ek duusare ko kis karte hue photo prakashit kii thi
 Anyway, both of them seemed very close
 sophia hayaat se jhagade ke masale par armaan kohli ne kaha ki ve sophia se naaraaz nahin hai
 Armaan rejected Salman Khan's take on Armaan's favorite
 mahilaon ke prati ashishtataa ke sawaal par armaan kohli ne kaha ki aisa nahin he
 They respect women a lot
 kohli ne kaha ki ve kuch filmon main khalanaayak kii bhoomika nibhaayenge or iske liye ve salmaan bhai kii madad lenge
 The verdict will come tomorrow after seven years in the murder of journalist Jade
 court main jaj samir ajkar is maamle main faisla sunaayenge
 According to the prosecution, the journalist Jade was killed at the behest of mafia gangster Chhota Rajan
 is maamle kii chaanbin ke baad police ne macoka court main aaropapatr daayar kiya tha
 There are many cases going on in Mumbai against underworld mafia gangster Chhota Rajan
 dilli kii tihaad jail main band rajan sabhi maamalon kii sunwaayee ke dauraan video conferencing ke jariye court main peshi detaa he
 Something similar will happen on Wednesday
 jab mumbai kii special macoka court main chota rajan sahit sabhi 11 aaropeepatrakaar jede hatyakandaka faisla sunne ke liye maujuud rahenge
 Judge Samir Ajkar will deliver his verdict amidst tight security
 abhiyojan paksh ke mutabitak mafia sargana chota rajan ko yah lagata tha ki jede uske khilaaf likhte the jabaki most wonted anderworld don daaud ibrahim kaa mahimamandan karte the
 It is for this reason that Chhota Rajan got journalist Jade killed
 udhar, chota rajan ke vakil anshuman simha ke mutabik abhiyojan paksh kaa kahana he ki chota rajan ne ye puraa shadyantra rachaa or saboot ke naam par unke paas kuch extra juditial kanpation tha
 But we say that these calls were fake and Chhota Rajan had no information about this
 darasal, chota rajan ke khilaaf ye aarope he ki jede kii hatya ke baad jab haahaakaar machaa tha, tab rajan ne kai news channelon ke daftar main phone kiya tha or usne kaha tha ki vah jede ko sirf dhamkaana chahta tha
 He did not intend to kill them
 abhiyojan paksh ne isi recording ko adaalat main saboot ke taur par pesh kiya tha
 According to the prosecution, Rajan, who was sitting abroad in those days, enlisted the help of shooter Satish Kalia and his accomplices
 chargeshit ke mutabik ek duusari patrkaar jigna vora ne jede kii pahchaan karaane main rajan ke gurgon kii madad kii thi
 But the defense contends that the prosecution has not properly presented the evidence in the court
 is sansanikhej hatyakand ke baad mumbai police ne ek press conference main bataaya tha ki aaropee kaise jede kaa peechha karte the
 The media also showed CCTV footage at that time
 media reports ke mutabik footage main dikhne vaale log vahi hatyare the jo jede kaa peechha karte the
 And in the end, he was the one who shot Jade
 lekin santosh deshpandey, satish kaaliya samet do or aropiyon ke vakil kaa kahana he ki adaalat main uparokt sabhi saboot laae hi nahin gaye the
 Two years ago when Rajan was brought from Indonesia
 tab ye cese mumbai police se lekar sibiai ko saunp diya gaya tha
 Government lawyer Pradeep Gharat produced 155 witnesses and the voice sample of Chhota Rajan, lodged in Tihar Jail, was also matched by other voices
 isaki report bhi adaalat main pesh kii gai thi
 Ballistic and scientific evidence in this entire case was presented on behalf of the prosecution
 or unhen lagata he ki ye sab saboot or gavaahon ke bayaan aropiyon ko sazaa dilwane main kaamyaab honge

 dilli police ne teen din pehle ghar ke baahar se kidanap kar liye gaye dhai saal ke bachche ko maatr 72 ghante ke andar mukt karakar misaal pesh kii he
 Police arrested two women and a man on charges of kidnapping and selling a child
 police ke mutabik, suuni god bharne kii laalasaa or paison ke laalach ke chalate bachche kaa apharan kiya gaya tha
 The child was kidnapped by a woman named Shivani, who works as a domestic maid in the area
 police ne shivani kii nishandehi par somvaar ko ishwar colony main rahane vaali rashmi naam kii mahila ke ghar se apahrit bachche ko surakshit baraamad kar liya
 Actually, Shivani kidnapped the child only at Rashmi's behest
 kidnaping main rashmi ke bhattije ne shivani kii madad kii thi
 All three have been arrested
 saath hi baccha laane ke liye rashmi dwaara shivani ko die gaye 45 hajaar rupayon main se police ne 42 hajaar rupee bhi baraamad kar liye
 Sukhram, who lives in a rented house of Indraj's colony in Bachbavana, had gone missing while playing outside the house, while his wife was a domestic woman
 23 farvari ko aparaahn kareeb 3
 At 0, his two and a half year old son Abhishek was playing in the street outside the house
 lekin abhishek rahasyamayi dhang se usee din se achaanak laapata ho gaya
 The family searched for Abhishek at their level, but no clue was found
 usee din abhishek ke pita ne bavana thane main bete kii gumshudagi kii report darj karwaai
 Kidnapper CCTV footage found Kidnapper from where Kidnapped child found Kidnapper's clue When police investigated footage of Sukhram's house near CCTV camera, the police team found important clues
 sisitivi footage main laal rang kii salwar kameez pahane ek mahila abhishek ko god main uthaakar le jaati dikhaai di
 The police team extracted the woman's photo from the footage and started searching for her
 haalanki police ko us mahila kii talash ke liye zyada dur nahin bhatakana padaa
 a person from the area identified the girl as Shivani living in Sayyid Colony
 maatr paanch gali dur thi kidanaparabata den ki bachche ko kidanap karne vaali shivani jis sayed colony main rahati he, vah abhishek ke ghar se maatr paanch gali chhodkar he
 But when the police team reached Shivani's house, a lock was found there
 padosiyon se puchhatacha main pataa chalaa ki shivani ek din pehle hi dikhi thi
 Neighbors said that Shivani is originally from Hardoi in Uttar Pradesh and Shivani lives in a rented house here
 yah bhi pataa chalaa ki shivani kothiyon main gharelu naukaraani kaa kaam karti he, jabaki uskaa pati factory main kaam karata he
 Now the police team started looking for Shivani by stirring
 aakhirkaar police team ne 25 farvari kii shaam dilli ke anand vihaar bas adde se shivani kii hiraasat main le liya
 Bringing him to the police station, Shivani was strictly questioned, so soon he confessed his crime

 When the police interrogated Rashmi and Rashmi's nephew who helped Shivani in kidnapping, it was revealed that Shivani used to work as a maid at Rashmi's house

 In view of the Rain Water Harvesting System, the NGT has directed the Delhi Government to list the Resident Welfare Association
 neshnal green tribunel ne central ground water athurity, dilli jal board ko rajdhani kii ardblue ke bare main puri jaankaree vaali stats report daayar karne ko kaha he
 The National Green Tribunal has given these instructions to show how many have installed rain harvesting systems in their areas, and where they can be installed
 sunwaayee ke dauraan jal board ne kaha ki arkepuram, lajpat nagar or dwarka main teen system shuru kar die gaye hai
 NGT has imposed penalty
 Before this, TNT had sought information from Delhi Jal Board about Maintenance Harvesting System in Delhi and NGT has also imposed penalty on many hospitals, hotels and malls for not installing rain harvesting system

 maharashtra main chunaav parinaam aae do hafte hone ko aae, magar abhi bhi vahaan sarkaar banati nahin dikh rahi he
 The BJP and Shiv Sena, who contested the elections simultaneously in Maharashtra, are now fighting among themselves as if they were enemies of birth
 darasal, donon dalon ke netaaon ke bich aapasi vishwaas itnaa kam ho gaya ki donon dalon ke bich baatcheet ek dam band he
 It seems as if there is no way of contact between the two parties
 maharashtra ke aankade bhi kuch isi tarah ke hai ki BJP or shivasena saath aaen, tabhi sthir sarkaar ban or chal sakati he
 The total strength of the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly is 288 and a majority of 145 is required
 ab BJP ke paas 105, shivasena ke paas 56, NCP ke paas 54 or congress ke paas 44 vidhayak hai
 There are 13 Independent mlas in the House and 14 mlas of smaller parties, most of whom have declared their support to the BJP or Shiv Sena
 so, BJP or shivasena kaa saath aana laazmi he
 But there are many types of screws here
 shivasena kaa kahana he ki BJP ke kendriya netritv or unke bich yah samjhauta hua tha ki maharashtra main sarkaar banane kii haalat main dhai-dhai saal kaa shashan baari-baari se hona chahie
 Shiv Sena argues that we should become the Chief Minister
 iske peeche vajah yah he ki pehali baar thakare parivaar kaa koi sadsy chunaav ladaa or jeeta he
 Not only this, Shiv Sena also wants some creamy ministries in Maharashtra and in Delhi too it wants to increase the number of its ministers in the Union Cabinet
 ab agar kisi kaaran se aisa nahin ho paata he, to doosraa vikalp he ki shivasena ko NCP samarthan de or congress voting ke dauraan sadan se gaiyrhaazir rahe
 In such a situation, the majority figure will be 123, but the Shiv Sena has 56 and the NCP also have a total of 110 mlas, so this coalition will also need 13 other mlas
 teesraa vikalp he BJP or NCP milakar sarkaar bana len
 Those suggesting this say that the way the Enforcement Directorate (ED) is taking action on Praful Patel and Sharad Pawar, it may be possible
 vaise yahi nahin, sharad pavaar ke bhattije ajit pavaar par bhi kai mukademe hai, so, aise main sharad pavaar ko BJP ko sarmathan dene ke liye taiyaar kiya ja saktaa he
 Meanwhile, a series of meetings are also going on under the exercise of forming a government in Maharashtra
 yah bhi khabar ai he ki BJP devendra fadanvis ke sthaan par kendriya mantri nitin gadakari or BJP pradeshdhyaksh chandrakant patil ke naamon par vichaar kar rahi he, to fadanvis ne sangh mukhyalay kii sharan lee
 The way Fadnavis had announced that he would become the Chief Minister, he had passed away many leaders
 duusari ore, shivasena netaa sanjay raut ne NCP pramukh sharad pavaar se mulaakaat kii, to pavaar ne apni press conference main kaha ki vah sonia gandhi se ek baar milenge
 But Pawar also said that he cannot tell what will happen in Maharashtra in the next two days
 udhar, dilli main congress ke varisht netaa ahamed patel ne gadakari se mulaakaat kii, lekin yah bhi kaha ki unki is mulaakaat kaa maharashtra main sarkaar banane se koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 In this way, it can be clearly said that the way to form a government in Maharashtra will be cleared only when BJP for Shiv Sena takes two steps back and Shiv Sena also takes a step back, otherwise it may not be that both parties 'tension and' i In the affair of Bada, Main Bada, Maharashtra should be under President's rule

 Despite being the host, the Bangladesh cricket team is surprised to see the Test pitch against India starting on Wednesday and its Sri Lankan coach Chandika Hathurusingha said she had never seen such a pitch before
 unhone kaha, ‘is pich ko bhaanpana mushkil he kyonki maine pehle kabhi aisi pich nahin dekhi
 We also have to take heat into consideration
 yah wicket tej gendbaajonki madadgaar nahin hogi
 He said, 'this is the new pitch
 hamen kal (buudhvaar) hi pataa chalegaa ki yah kisi he
 He also said that the host team had not given any instructions to prepare the pitch as it usually does
 coach ne kaha, ‘pehali baar hamane koi nirdesh nahin diya ki wicket kisi honi chahie
 We will try to choose a team that can take 20 wickets
 hamane yahaan first class match or kuch bisiel vanade match khele hai lihaaja hamen kuch andaja he
 He said, "usually there is no grass on Test wickets but in odis or other formats, the grass stays for five days or how much impact it will have on the game, it has to be seen
 ’hathurusingha ne kaha, ‘spinneron ko pehle din se hi phayda milegaa or ballebaaj bhi aaraam se khel sakenge
 'he said that the grass on the pitch is unpredictable
 unhone kaha, ‘wicket par kaaphi kati hui ghaas he
 Don't know what wicket it will be
 yaa to pich par bahut ghaas hoti he yaa nahin hoti
 it's different
 wicket ke upar kati hui ghaas he or pataa nahin iskaa nechar kaisaa hoga
 'he said,' The moisture will be much longer on this and probably this is why the grass has been laid on it

 US space agency NASA says analysis of samples collected from Mars surface rocks by Curiosity Rover indicated that microorganisms may have existed on Mars in the past

 Scientists have identified sulfur, nitrogen, hydrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and carbon in the powder that was extracted by Curiosity Rover from a hole in a rock near an old stream flowing into the Gale Crater on Mars last month

 a 42-year-old Dalit from Dabra village died on the night of 18 September by consuming poison, because the honor of his minor daughter was strangled by Jat boys and he could not do anything
 ladki kaa aarope he ki saat ladakon ne uske saath gaanv ke hi khet main balaatkaar kiya or paanch ladke is baat par najar rakhe hue the ki koi unhen dekh na paae
 It is also alleged that during this time the boys also took pictures from mobile

 The Dalit community refused to cremate the body until the accused were arrested

 On the same day, the victim's mother told India Today, "we are poor, weak, so our daughter was targeted
 ab hamaara sab kuch barbaad ho chukaa he
 Our only demand is that those miscreants be arrested
 ’’peedita ke taaoo ne aarope lagaaya, ‘‘jat samudaay ke ek netaa ne ham se kaha ki media ko gaanv main na aane den
 It is a matter of the village

 But we did not go to his panchayat
 ’’ unka yahaan tak kahana he ki ek aaropee ko ek din pehle tak gaanv main hi dekha gaya, lekin police use giraftaar nahin kar saki
 However, by the evening of 26 September, the police arrested nine of the 12 accused

 Even on contact with India Today, the Public Relations Department of Haryana Government cited the absence of time
 hisar ke dipti kamishnar (disi) amit kumaar agarwal ne kaha, ‘‘ladki ke saath atyaachaar hua he
 Jat vs Dalit is not right
 ’’lekin, haryana main dabda cond koi akeli ghatana nahin he,
 There have been successive incidents in the state where Dalits have been targeted simply because they do not want to remain a 'silent spectator' (see: guest column)
 disi daftar ke thik saamne chaar maheene se jile ke hi bhagaanaa gaanv ke bahut se dalit parivaar deraa jamaaye hai
 The controversy started in May this year in Bhagana village when the Dalits on the land of the Gram Panchayat, Dr
 bhimrao ambedkar kii murti lagane or gaanv ke play granud par daliton ko patte dene kii maang uthaai
 The Jat community opposed this and after winning the case in court, they surrounded the land of the gram panchayat and named it 'ahlan Pana Chowk'
 chowk kii charadivari ne dalit basti kii ore jane vaali sankari gali ko band kar diya haalanki bagal main hi maujuud mukhya rasta puri tarah khulaa rahaa
 But it did not take long for the tension in the village with 550 Jat and 350 Dalit houses to exist
 ‘‘jaaton ne hamaara hukka-pani band kar diya
 On 21 May, 70 Dalit families left the village and took refuge in the court
 or ham aaj tak yaheen date hai
 "this is to say of 30-year-old Jagdish Ghazala who is staging here
" dalit mahilaayein kachhari kii sidhippon ke saamne hi chulhaa-chaukaa kar rahi hai
 The elderly are lying on a broken bed and the government running in the office for children is a matter of curiosity
 apni is jang main unka sabase bada sahaara he, baba sahib kii tasviir jo badi shraddha ke saath vahaan virajman he
 Regarding this battle of Aan, Ghazala said, "we will not return until the statue of Babasaheb is installed on the Chowk and the play ground will not be given to the Dalits
" ’’udhar, gaanv main tasviir kaa doosraa pahalu najar aata he
 Narendra Singh of the Jat community told India Today at 'ahlan Pana Chowk' in the presence of some Dalits that even today the cows of Dalit and other community people are being tied
 narendra singh ne kaha, ‘‘jo bhai gaanv chhodkar gaye hai ve waapas aa jaaen to hamen kya virodh he
 He said that those who are going on sit-in in the court are getting the help of some organizations
 dharna de rahe dalit gaanv ke daliton par bhi unke saath shaamil hone kaa dabaav bana rahe hai
 On September 13, a boy named Manjit of the Dalit community was beaten up by the people of the Dalit community itself
 is maamle main 19 daliton ko giraftaar kiya gaya
 Manjeet said that a quarrel had started over the issue of supporting the dharna
 lekin jat samudaay ke logon se jab india today ne poocha, ‘‘jab itnaa hi bhaichara he to kyon nahin aap badppan dikhaate hue baba sahib kii murti lag jane dete
 "the diplomatic reply to this was," "there is a fight at the square right now
" kal ko koi murti ko nuksaan pahunchaa de to nayaa bakheda khadaa ho jayega
 We will not allow the idol to be installed
 ’’bhagaanaa se 50 kimi dur sthit mirchpur ke bahucharchit cond main yahi baat saamne ai thi
 On April 19, 2010, a minor incident such as a dog barking took such a terrible form in the village that two houses of Dalits were set on fire two days later
 us din ko yaad karte hue 70 saal ke chandra singh chouhan bataate hai, ‘‘tarachand valmiki or unki apahiz beti suman ko ghar main hi jinda jala diya
 We were also caught in the fire
 agar damakal kii gaadi vakt rahete aag na bujhati to maranaa tay tha
 "public administration books from Suman's room can be considered as proof that the Dalits of Haryana are desperate to change their lives
" phir 24 april ko yahaan se bhi valmiki samudaay ke logon ne palaayan kiya or 27 april ko rahul gandhi bhi apane andaaj main yahaan pahunche
 After the arrival of Rahul, the Haryana government suddenly came into action
 tab se gaanv main siarpief kii company tainaat he
 The government provided jobs and security guards to the three sons of Tarachand Valmiki, who died in the fire
 parivaar ko 30 lakh ru
 Also received compensation

 But the mud filled in the streets of Valmiki colony and the soot of hatred in the heart is not over yet
 20 saal ke aman chouhan kehete hai, ‘‘ham is gaanv main rahanaa nahin chaahate
 Now neither do we want to work in the field of Jats nor do they want us to work
 gussa donon taraf he
 What will we eat here when there is no work? sarkaar hamen hisar main makaan de
 The second end of the agony of Mirchpur opens in the farmhouse of Vedpal Tanwar, a social activist fighting for the fight of Dalits in Hisar
 yahaan do saal se rah rahe dalit pariwaron kii numaaindgi kar rahe satyawan valmiki kehete hai, ‘‘gaanv main rah rahe log aapako sach nahin bataa paaenge
 All those who testified against the Jats in the court are out of the village
 gaanv main koun aisa he jisane jaaton ke thappad na khaae hon
 "they have a direct demand that the government give them a plot in Hisar
 dalit or unke shubhachintakon ke bare main sarkaar kii kya raay he, isaki baangi pichley maheene hui ek ghatana se mili
 a woman named Suman died of snake bite at Tanwar's farm house
 is maamle main police ne farm house ke maalik vedapal tanvar ko hi gaiyr-iradatan hatya kii dhara main jail main band kar diya
 Most Valmiki families called it a government conspiracy against Tanwar
 tanvar ne kaha, ‘‘mujhe ek maheene tak jail main band rakhaa
 i was released after the statement of the family of the deceased
 ’’ tanvar kaa kahana he ki pradesh ke donon pramukh rajnatik dalon kaa netritv jat samudaay ke haath main he
 The story of Dalit atrocities in Haryana is old
 hooda se pehle indian neshnal lokdal (ieneldi) ke mukhyamantri om prakaash chautaala ke shashan main dulina cond main paanch daliton ko petakar maaraa daalaa gaya, kyonki unka yah kasoor tha ki ve gaay kaa chamada nikaal rahe the
 It is not very old when Dalits cast their votes in Haryana
 lekin ab vakt badal rahaa he
 The result of this year's Lok Sabha by-election in Hisar has shown a mild glimpse of this journey
 upachunaav main kuldeep bishnoi ne om prakaash chautaala ke bete ajay chautaala ko 23,000 se adhik voton se maat di
 But it is not so easy to get rooted in the roots of non-jat politics
 uttar pradesh main paanv jamaane se kahin pehle bahujan samaaj party (bispi) ne khud ko haryana main sthapit karne kii koshish kii thi
 But his elephant could not get healthy in the political climate here
 haryana main dalit jis tarah se khud ko abhivyakt karne kii ladaai lard rahe hai, aise main bahut lambey samay tak unhen siyasat ke haashiye par rakhana mumkin nahin hoga

 bihar main mahagathbandhan tuutane or lalu prasad yadav ke jail jane ke baavjood rashtriya janata dal kaa jaadu kam nahin hua he
 The results of the Jokihat assembly by-election that came today, at least, indicate the same
 jokihat kii seat sattarudh janata dal united ke paas thi lekin ab isapar 40 hajaar se zyada voton ke antar se argedy ne kabja kar liya he
 Encouraged by the results, Tejashwi Yadav has once again attacked Chief Minister Nitish Kumar
 jokihat main mukhya muqabla argedy ke shahanvaj alam or jediu ke murshid alam ke bich tha
 JDU MLA Sarfaraz Alam resigned from this seat and joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and then became vacant after he was elected as an MP from Araria
 shahanvaj alam sarfaraj alam ke hi bhai hai
 After the break-up of the Grand Alliance, the RJD strong JDU-RJD and the Congress after the break-up of the Grand Alliance, there were by-elections in one Lok Sabha and 2 Assembly seats in the state
 inamen se ek loksabhaa or ek vidhansabha kii seat argedy ko mili jabaki ek seat par bijepi ne jeet darj kii
 It is clear from the results of Jokihat that the ruling BJP-JDU alliance could not face the rjd-congress
 nitish kumaar ke mukhyamantri banane ke baad 2005 se jediu ne lagaataar chaar baar jokihat seat jiti he lekin is baar sattadhari dal ko munh kii khaani padi
 This happened when the party left no stone unturned to win and this seat was transformed into a battle of prestige
 jail main lalu, magar jalawaa kaaymargedy kii jeet se saaf he ki supremeo lalu yadav ke jail jane ke baad bhi party kaa jalawaa barkaraar he
 Tejaswi Yadav's stature will increase with this victory
 bihar main bijepi-jediu ko haraane kaa phayda loksabhaa chunaav ke liye taiyaar ho rahe vipakshi gathbandhan ko bhi milegaa or gathbandhan ke bheetar bhi tejasvi kii sthiti majboot hogi
 At the center front, when the opposition is united against the BJP, then the role of every regional party will become important

 These days, when people talk about a woman president, Hillary Clinton's name often comes to her mind
 kumud shrinivasana vaise to kisi desh kii mukhiya nahin hai, lekin ve intel india kii adhyaksh ke taur par duniya main technology kii sabase badi companiyon main shumaar company kaa sanchaalan karti hai
 Raised in Kolkata and from there, Srinivasan, who had a degree in Economics, chose a path that was, in his words, 'typical' for the youth
 ve aage kii padhai ke liye america ravaanaa ho gayi
 She initially wanted to pursue an MBA, but later became interested in computers and programming
 is tarah ve teji se kamyaabi kii sidhiruaan tay karte hue intel india kii adhyaksh ban gayi
 Srinivasan earned a Masters degree in Information and Library Studies from Syracuse University in 1984
 1987 main intel main aana unke liye kuch had tak 'ek ghatana' hi thi
 Since then, she has held several key positions in business and information systems at Intel's manufacturing and IT companies
 ve kahati hai, 'maine karmchaaree ke taur par shuruyaat kithi, par jald hi management kaa kaam sanbhaalane lagi
 After that, like most heads of Intel, i also got all kinds of responsibilities
 meri tarakkee hoti gai
 i started in industrial automation
 tarakkee karke intel ke kai process or sanghathanon main digital transformation kii ore mud gai
 When the post of President of Intel India came up, i decided to get it, because i felt that this post will be challenging for me in many ways
 mujhe dobaaraa un logon main jane kaa mauka milegaa, jahaan main paidaa hui thi or pali-badi thi
 'hard work in the company: Intel has a variety of responsibilities on Srinivasan, of which leadership is the biggest responsibility
 iske alaava ve company kii ranneeti, market deveopment ke liye nae tareekon or sarkaar, udyog or academia ke saath sambandh banane kaa kaam bhi sambhalati hai
 She says, 'I have spent 21 years living in Intel's factories and breathing industrial automation
 maine intel ke bheetar kaam kaa str upar uthaane par jor diya he
 This has increased our technical expertise and has necessitated creating a culture of work in which we can move forward by challenging the status quo
 hamaari yahi samskruti hamen aage badaae ke liye takat or vishwaas degi
 'she constantly tells about moving forward,' Once a mentor told me about my working attitude, chasing infinity, i believe that i should use my full potential in all directions, whatever i can do
 i should do all that
 duusare shabdon main kahen to mujhe parivaar ke sadsy, or samaaj ke sadsy ke taur par apni puri urja kaa upyog karnaa chahie
 "biggest Challenges: Srinivasan says," It is always a big challenge to fulfill my dreams without realizing that as someone's wife and guardian i am doing injustice to myself
 main pehle kah chuki hum ki aparadhbodh naritv kaa abhishaap he
 'in this subject she adds,' Taking the same experience over the years, i have done my work adequately and learned to move forward
 'yuvaaon ko unki salaah:shrinivasana kahati hai, 'apane aap se pucho, aap jo kar rahe hai, use kyon kar rahe hai
 It is important to know the answer to this, because there may be a time in your life when you have to face disappointment and shaking
 yah 'kyon' shabd us samay bhi sahi rahegaa, bhale hi nateeja aapke manmutabik na ho
 'srinivasan uses the help of Simone Sinek's model to explain this
 yah model hamen salaah detaa he ki jab kisi lakshya kii ore bad rahe hon to pehle 'kyon' phir 'kaise' or ant main 'kya' par vichaar karnaa chahie

 in 16 teston kii 29 pariyon main 44
 He has scored 1299 runs at an average of 79, including 3 centuries and 7 fifties

 There are 971 runs at an average of 84
 is dauraan gabbar ke naam se mashhoor openar ne 3 shatak or 2 ardhshtak banaae hai
 The comments ab sawaal he colombo main opening koun karegaa? cheteshwar pujaara, keel rahul, ajinkya rahane yaa phir rohit sharma
 KL Rahul has opened in the first Test and despite not playing bat, he can get a chance
 vahiin cheteshwar pujaara ko england-australia ke kharaab daure ke baad mauka nahin mila he
 In such a situation, he hopes that he can get the benefit of Shikhar's injury
 mumkin he team india kii is pareshaani kii vajah se number teen par lagaataar flop ho rahe rohit sharma ko bhi ek or jeevandaan mil jaae
 However, shikhar-vijay's injury has become a big problem for the team and India, who had lost 0-1 in the series, will now have to find the winning combination

 keel rahul pehle test main opening kar chuke hai or balla nahin chalane ke baavjood unhen ek mauka mil saktaa he
 At the same time, Cheteshwar Pujara has not got a chance after a bad tour of england-australia
 aise main unhen ummid he unhen shikhar kii chot kaa phayda mil saktaa he
 It is possible that due to this problem of Team India, Rohit Sharma, who is constantly flopting at number three, can also get another life

 # soch bdlo desh bdlega The news and photos of India's Under-19 team defeating the Australian team defending the title in Australia for the third time won the title, and the families of these very excited players also took care of their children
 Become a part of the happiness achieved by success
 
 
 lekin is shandaar jeet ko hasil karne ke liye bharat kii is yuva brigade ne aisi training lee thi, jiske bare main jaanakar baaki junior timen to kya, senior timen bhi chaunk uthengi
 
 
 In fact, these under-19 players were not just trained with bat and ball by coach Bharat Arun in a unique experiment during the coaching camp in Bangalore just before the World Cup; Also got commando training
 
 
 is training kaa makasad team ke khilaadiyon ko kathin se kathin halaat main bhi ekajutata kaa paath sikhaanaa tha, jiske liye team ke sabhi khilaadiyon ko bangalore ke camp se hataakar mysore ke nagar hole forest main le jaaya gaya
 
 
 In these jungles of Mysore, players were taught team building through a variety of drills and tasks, and the fighting spirit was instilled within them
 
 
 tippaniyan Bharat Arun seems to have tried the tricks of former Australian coach John Buchanan, who used to organize similar butt camps in the jungles for his team before every difficult series, but this tactic of the Indian coach has its effect in World Cup matches
 Got to see clearly
 
 
 team india ne chir-pratidwandvi pakistan ke khilaaf ek wicket se behad romaanchak jeet hasil kii
 
 
 After recovering from the pressure, the Indian team defeated New Zealand by nine runs in a very close semi-final match, and finally won the title by defeating Australia's team, who were called undefeated in the most challenging final
 
 
 so, in nateezon se saaf zaahir he ki coach dwaara team ke khilaadiyon ko dilwaai gai commando training, or uske jariye khilaadiyon main paidaa kiya gaya jujharupan team india kii aitihaasik jeet kaa behad ahm hissaa rahi
 
 
 But to achieve this magnificent victory, this young brigade of India had taken such training, knowing about what the other junior teams would be surprised and the senior teams would also be shocked
 
 
 darasal, under-19 ke in khilaadiyon ko coach bharat arun ne vishwacap se thik pehle bangalore main hue koching camp ke dauraan ek anokhe prayog ke tahat sirf balle or gend se hi train nahin kiya, inhen mushkil se mushkil halaat se do-chaar hone ke liye commando training bhi dilwaai
 
 
 The objective of this training was to teach the team players a lesson of solidarity even in the toughest conditions, for which all the players of the team were removed from the camp in Bangalore and taken to the Civil Hole Forest of Mysore
 
 
 mysore ke in jangalon main khilaadiyon ko kai prakaar ke drill or task ke jariye team building sikhaai gai, or unke bheetar har haal main ladane kii bhaavana ko jagaaya gaya
 
 
 The comments lagata he, bharat arun ne australia ke purv coach jon bukanan kii tarkeeb aajamaai, jo har mushkil series se pehle apni team ke liye jangalon main aise hi bat camp yojit kiya karte the, lekin bharat ke coach kii is tarkeeb kaa asar vishwacap ke maichon main saaf dekhne ko mila
 
 
 Team India won a thrilling one-wicket win against arch-rivals Pakistan
 
 
 uske baad dabaav se ubarte hue behad kareebi semi-final mukaable main bhartiya team ne newzealand ko nau ran se haraaya, tathaa aakhir main sabase zyaada chunauteepurn final mukaable main avijit kahi jane vaali australia kii team ko unheen kii dharti par haraakar khitaab jeeta
 
 
 So, it is clear from these results that the commando training provided by the coach to the players of the team, and the arrogance created by them through the players, was a very important part of India's historic win
 
 
 is training kaa makasad team ke khilaadiyon ko kathin se kathin halaat main bhi ekajutata kaa paath sikhaanaa tha, jiske liye team ke sabhi khilaadiyon ko bangalore ke camp se hataakar mysore ke nagar hole forest main le jaaya gaya

 Sonia Gandhi has been made the interim president of the Congress
 ye faisla congress adhyaksh pad ko lekar hui congress varking cameti (CWC) main liya gaya
 Earlier, Rahul Gandhi was adamant on leaving the post of president
 rahul gandhi dwaara party netaaon kaa aagrah asweekaar kiye jane ke baad seedblusi ne sonia gandhi ko antarim adhyaksh niyukt kiya
 She will hold this responsibility until the election of the new president

 The organization started the tradition of elections in his nearly 20-month journey as a Congress president, with huge successes in the form of electoral victories in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan, but the party's poor defeat in the Lok Sabha elections in 2019, wrote a big example of his failure

 The Congress lost the Gujarat elections by a small margin, but many political experts praised Rahul Gandhi's leadership and the party's election strategy

 Rahul Gandhi resigned as the party's president in a meeting of the party working committee held on May 25 after the Congress's defeat in the Lok Sabha elections

 By the way, Rahul Gandhi has also said that he will continue to work actively for the party despite not being the president

 Know now what excuses Pakistan made
 1
 Pakistan has placed full emphasis on the fact that this time the world will somehow come under its deception
 2
 Pakistan, which is open to jihadi and terrorists, is trying to identify itself as a terror-stricken country
 3
 The US help is responding to a halt by the fact that the US was not doing Pakistan any favors
 4
 Pakistan is now beginning to say that if its help is counted in money, then on the contrary, America gets 9 billion dollars
 5
 Pakistan is trying to show that it does not help America, but does not openly insult it
 6
 Pakistan is trying to show that if America does not give it money then it has other options like China
 7
 Pakistan is busy demonstrating that the US will not do without Pakistan in winning the fight against Taliban in Afghanistan
 lekin pakistan jin puraane jhooth or puraane bahaanon ko nai packaging ke saath bechney main juta he, un jhooth or bahaanon ko america ne pichley 15 saal main khub kharida lekin ab wo ise kharidne ke mood main katai nahin he

 Those who know Congress President Rahul Gandhi's personality closely know that his image among the general public is completely opposite to that
 rahul gandhi daliton ke liye dil main khaas jagah rakhte hai
 He talks of equality, advocates to bring non-political people into politics, does not like those who make money from politics, and lying in politics is a crime
 rahul gandhi siyasat main jimmedaari ko dil se nibhaane ke pakshdhar hai
 Dynasty does not like Rahul, he wants to advance the poor
 javabdehi chaahate hai
 Wanting democracy in the party, therefore, NSUI and Youth conduct elections in Congress and in 2014 bring a pilot project to conduct elections among candidates for Lok Sabha ticket
 ye sab baaten aisi hai, jinako jaanakar lagata he ki aisa hi aadmi to hindustan ko chahie
 Then why does Rahul appear unsuccessful in politics? Why Rahul's formulas get hit on the political plane? Why does idealism die in the face of ground reality? 10 big things come to light when the Congress leaders are not able to say it openly
 1
 When Rahul Gandhi, who talks about democracy in the party, conducts elections for NSUI, Youth Congress and party candidate, the fight within the party weakens the party even before fighting the opposition party
 isliye enesayuai or youth congress kii kamjor haalat kisi se chhipi nahin he
 2
 gaiyr raajnneetik logon ko siyasat main aage laane kii vakaalat tab baari padati he, jab rahul gandhi siyaasi faislon main unako tarjeeh dete hai
 Like party leaders are consulted, but in everyday political decisions, non-political people who are in the role of PA of Rahul become influential, then when the situation worsens, the leaders are given the responsibility to handle
 3
 Rahul Gandhi meets the leaders in meetings and rallies, but they get up, sit and travel with people like their PA
 rahul ke pie kii bhoomika main kaushal, alankaar, sachin raav, nikhil alva or prashasnic seva se aae ke raju hai
 Those who have brought better education from abroad
 insaan bhi behatar hai, lekin siyaasi samaj-boojh or jamini hakeekat se dur hai par rahul ke chahete hai
 For example, the responsibility of the media was on the shoulders of Randeep Surjewala till the dates of the Lok Sabha elections, but during the elections, Rahul's interview was entrusted to Nikhil Alva
 nikhil ko achaanak itnaa bada jimmaa mila, unki samaj kaa andaja isi baat se lagaaie ki unhone rahul kii tulana hafiz said se karne vaale ghor congress virdohi channel se saakshaatkaar karvaa diya
 a similar example is that of Amethi, where Rahul Gandhi made his own team after the leave of Sonia Gandhi's team after 2009
 saal 2014 ke chunaavon main aakhir main majaboor hokar sonia kii team kaa sahaara liya or kisi tarah jeet gaye, lekin team rahul ne saal 2019 main amethi main bhi rahul kii lutiyaa dubo hi di
 4
 rahul profeshnals or data par bhi khub yakeen rakhte hai
 But the Congress ideology is probably left behind
 rahul ke ye kareebi hon yaa rahul ke prabhaav se congress ke data vibhaag ke chairman praveen chakravarti sabhi rahul ko bataate rahe ki modi kisi surat main wo ankaganit nahin paa sakenge, jisase wo dobaaraa piem ban paaen
 Rahul also blindly trusted him and first of all the records then started speaking the same freely
 darasal, rahul dil se aisa maanakar chalane lage
 The results predicted by the data department based on the booth level data given through the Shakti app were all the opposite
 5
 In pa's office, which is a team of PA people, it is believed that most but not all are of leftist thinking
 isliye rahul kaa mandir-mandir janaa, pro muslim party kii chhavi todane kii koshish hona tab sambhav hua, jab 2014 main buree haar hui
 This was finally possible due to pressure from Congress leaders
 isliye party ke netaa kehete hai ki, rahul ko indira gandhi kaa secularism apnaanaa chahie naa ki vampanth kaa
 Otherwise, whatever happened to leftist politics, the same will happen to the Congress
 vaise khaali rahul hi nahin priyanka gandhi ke pie kii bhoomika nibhaane vaale bhi jeenyu se aane vaale vampanthi sandip singh hi hai, jinke bare main kaha jaataa he ki wo manmohan singh ko piem rahete kaale jhande dikhaa chuke hai
 Congress leaders believe that Rahul should definitely keep the youth with him but he should be political
 6
 Idealism and political reality Rahul Gandhi often chose idealism, which the party had to bear
 adarshavaad is baat kaa ki koi paise vaala he, sakasham he or haisiyat vaala he sirf isliye wo badhiya netaa nahin ho saktaa or jo fatehaal yaa saadagi dikhaata he vahi behatar netaa ho saktaa he
 For example, leaders like Madhusudan Mistry, Deepak Bavaria like Rahul
 ye sawaal rahul ke kareebi milind devda pehle hi uthaa chuke hai
 7
 ek bada sawaal or aata he ki rahul apane neeche to dalit, vanchit, garib netaaon ko aage laane ke pakshdhar hai, lekin jab baat dosti kii aati he to zyaadaatar yaa to bade netaaon ke bete-beti hote hai yaa raja-maharaja
 For example, Milind Deora, Maharaj Jitendra Singh, Maharaj Jyotiraditya Scindia, Sachin Pilot, Omar Abdullah, etc
 8
 Rahul and his team are English
 chijen angreji main tay hoti hai
 They are thought in English and then it is hindered according to need
 iskaa khamiyaja hindi pattee kii siyasat main hua he
 Even the big leaders keep trying to make him understand that his news or talk will come on some English platform, even if his TRP or circulation is very low? He feels that his words will reach the high command in this way
 tab wo aam janata yaa hindi pattee kaa khyaal hi nahin rakhata
 9
 congress netaa maanate hai ki rahul netaaon ke prati apni pasand naapsand jaahir kar dete hai
 Whereas the chairman should not act on the talent of everyone, not expressing his dislike
 saath hi jisko pasand karte hai un par zyada hi meharbaan ho jate hai
 For example, once he liked Beni Prasad Verma, he was always kind to him, then to Raj Babbar and PL Punia
 saal 2014 main haarane ke baad bhi rajyasabha kii seat di, rajbabbar ko upi adhyaksh banaaya, phir pehle muradabad uske baad fatehpur sikri seat chunane kii chhot bhi di
 PL Punia himself became a Rajya Sabha MP and his son got a Lok Sabha ticket
 vahiin bijepi se congress main aae naanaa patole ko pehle kisaan congress kaa adhyaksh banaaya gaya phir nagpur se tikat bhi mila
 10
 rahul kii team siyaasi nahin isliye muddon ko pakadaney main or jameen par uske safal hone yaa asafal hone kaa sahi feedback rahul ko nahin mil paata
 Like - the watchman is a thief, he was not walking on the ground
 utsaah or rahul kii energy ke chalate congress kii reliyon main hi aawaaj goonjati thi, jise rahul safalataa samaj rahe the
 The Congress was lagging behind on issues like Balakot

 Various political parties on Sunday reacted strongly to the meeting between Sartaj Aziz, advisor to Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and separatists from Kashmir
 bijepi ne ise jahaan sarkaar kii kootnithik galati bataaya, vahiin upie ne kaha ki vah kashmir mudde par koi samjhauta nahin karne ja rahi
 BJP president Rajnath Singh said that by allowing Aziz to meet Pakistani separatists on Indian soil, the government has made a 'diplomatic mistake' and demanded that the talks be stopped
 singh ne ek bayaan main kaha, 'sartaaj ajij ko kashmiri algaavvaadiyon se vaarta karne kii anumati dekar upie sarkaar ne ek or kootnithik galati kii he jo desh kii suraksha or desh ke hiton ke liye mahangi sabit hogi
 The BJP leader said that the issue of Kashmir is an internal matter of India and it should be resolved within the country
 unhone kaha ki pakistan kai varshon se kashmir mudde kaa antarrashtriyakaran karne kaa prayaas kar rahaa he
 He said that Pakistan had once again raised the Kashmir issue during the United Nations General Assembly meeting

 Information and Broadcasting Minister Manish Tiwari said that since 1996, the democratic process has been going on in the state
 unhone kaha ki in vaarta main shaamil hone vaale hurriyat netaaon ko logon kii ummiido par khara utarana chahie
 Tiwari said, 'hurriyat should also introspect on the matter whether they are truly representative of the people and then they should also participate in the democratic process of the country

 The Hurriyat should become a part of this process
 ' ajij ne kaha ki pakistan bhi ilaake main shanti bahaali kaa prayaas kar rahaa he
 Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, leader of the moderate faction of the Hurriyat Conference, wondered why the meeting was being viewed in a negative manner
 faruk ne kaha, 'ham pehali baar dilli nahin aae hai or na hi pehali baar yahaan ke logon se mulaakaat kar rahe hai
 He said, 'we have always said that we want cooperation between the people of India, Pakistan and Kashmir and we do not want any fight

 yah pehali baar nahin he, jab supreme court ne aitihaasik aadesh diya he
 Nearly 40 years ago, the Supreme Court delivered a landmark judgment in the case of Hussainara Khatoon v
 Bihar Home Secretary
 isamen sheersh adaalat ne desh kii jelon main band 40 hajaar kaidiyon ko fouran reeha karne kaa aadesh diya tha
 The public interest litigation (PIL) followed this case
 iske tahat agar kisi bhi vyakti ke moulik adhikaron kaa hanan hota he or wo garibi yaa ashiksha ke kaaran court main cese nahin kar saktaa he, to wo post card yaa chitthee likhakar supreme court ko bhej saktaa he
 If the Supreme Court feels that the fundamental rights of the person writing the post card or letter have been violated, then they can take cognizance of it as PIL
 is tarah nyaay ko aam aadmi ke liye aasaan banane kaa shrey purv chif justise pien bhagwati ko jaataa he
 In 1979, the then Justice of the Supreme Court, Bhagwati, while hearing in the Hussainara Khatoon case, said that the constitution gave everyone the fundamental right to live life with dignity
 garibi yaa ashiksha ke kaaran kisi ko nyaay se vanchit nahin rakhaa ja saktaa he
 When the Hussainara Khatoon case came before the Supreme Court, it was shocking
 isamen kaha gaya tha ki bihar kii jelon main kai hajaar kaidi lambey samay se band hai
 In their case, no charge sheet has been filed nor trial has been started
 in kaidiyon ko jin aparaadhon ke aarope main jail main daalaa gaya he, ye us aparaadh ke sabit hone par milane vaali sajaa se bhi zyada samay se jail main band hai
 After this, the Supreme Court summoned the Bihar government
 is par bihar sarkaar kaa kahana tha ki ye kaidi na vakil kar paa rahe hai or na hi jamaanat kii raashi de paa rahe hai, jiske chalate inke maamle kii sunwaayee aage nahin ho paa rahi he
 However, this plea of the Bihar government was rejected by the Supreme Court
 is maamle main bihar kii jail main band kaidiyon kii pairvi edwocket puspa kapila hingorani ne kii thi
 The Supreme Court had said that if a person is arrested on a charge, he cannot be kept in jail for any longer than the punishment prescribed for that crime
 yadi aisa kiya jaataa he, to us vyakti ke anuchhed 21 main mili moulik adhikaron kaa hanan he
 Law professor Dr
 Rajesh Dubey says that on the violation of fundamental rights, everyone has the right to approach the Supreme Court directly under Article 32
 iske alaava moulik adhikaron kii raksha ke liye anuchhed 226 ke tahat hoicourt kaa rukh kiya ja saktaa he
 CM Devendra Fadnavis, who was able to complete only 2 cms in Maharashtra, broke the record of 44 years, the highest for 11 years
 Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis has broken the record of 44 years in terms of completion of tenure
 vahiin paanch varsh kaa kaarykaal puraa karne ke maamle main vah rajya ke duusare mukhyamantri ban gaye hai
 Just before Devendra Fadnavis, Vasantrao Naik had succeeded in achieving this feat
 rajya main zyaadaatar samay congress kaa hi shashan rahaa
 While the Congress removed some chief ministers from time to time due to failures, some had to step down due to being called from the state to the politics of the Center
 rajya main jitne bhi mukhyamantri hue hai, usamen adhiktar ko vipaksh se zyada party ke andarkhaane kursi ke liye sangharsh karnaa padaa he
 If Fadnavis completes his tenure as Chief Minister for the second time, he will be able to match Vasantrao Naik in terms of completing two terms
 rajya ke pehle mukhyamantri yashavanth raav chavaan or sharad pavaar ko raksha mantri banane ke kaaran pad chhodana padaa tha
 Fadnavis, who was successful in saving the chair, got a thorn tool when Devendra Fadnavis became the Chief Minister in 2014 in Maharashtra
 li se hatakar bijepi ne gaiyr maratha card khelkar brahman chehre fadanvis ko mukhyamantri banaakar sabko chaunkaa diya tha
 Chief Minister Fadnavis struggled with the Dalit movement, Maratha movement and peasant movements during his five-year tenure
 magar unhone sooyeeboojh se in andolanon ko shant karne main safalataa hasil kii
 With which he was able to save the Chief Minister's chair
 sutara bataate hai ki party ke andarkhaane bhi vah sabhi varisht netaaon ko saadhane main safal rahe
 Vasantrao Naik was Chief Minister for more than 11 years, Vasant Rao Naik was the Chief Minister of Maharashtra for the longest time
 congress sarkaar main vasant raav nik 11 saal se zyada kul 4097 din mukhyamantri rahe
 He became the Chief Minister for the first time on December 5, 1963 and remained in the post till March 1, 1967
 vahiin duusari baar 13 march 1972 se 20 farvari 1975 tak mukhyamantri rahe
 He was the first Chief Minister to complete his tenure in the state after independence
 nike ke siem banane se pehle or unke baad( devendra fadanvis ko chhodkar) koi mukhyamantri kaarykaal nahin puraa kar paaya
 For example, Yashwant Rao Chavan, the first Chief Minister of the state, remained Chief Minister from May 1, 1960 to November 19, 1962
 duusare mukhyamantri morotrao kannamvaar kareeb ek saal tak hi pad par rahe
 At the same time, the third Chief Minister PK Savant remained in the chair for only ten days
 1978 tak rajya main congress ke hi mukhyamantri rahe
 Maratha Kshatrapa Sharad Pawar's round of government was formed on 18 July 1978 in the state of the leaders separated from the Congress
 naam tha pragatisheel democratic front
 Maratha Kshatrap Sharad Pawar succeeded in becoming Chief Minister on 18 July 1978 at the age of 38
 vah is pad par 17 farvari 1980 tak yani 480 din tak rahe
 Sharad Pawar was in Congress before becoming CM in the Progressive Democratic Front government
 baad main indira gandhi sarkaar ke centre main bahumat kii sarkaar banane ke baad sharad pavaar kii sarkaar barkhaast ho gai thi
 After this, Congress governments were there again until 1995
 phir 1987 tak sharad pavaar phir congress kaa hissaa ban gaye the
 Sharad Pawar was successful in becoming the Chief Minister twice more in the Congress government
 vah congress kii sarkaar main 26 june 1988 se 25 june 1991 or phir chah march 1993 se 14 march 1993 tak mukhyamantri rahe
 Shiv sena-bjp phase begins The bjp-shiv Sena coalition government started in 1995 after the Congress was weakened in the state
 gathbandhan sarkaar banane par shivasena netaa manohar joshi 14 march 1995 se 1999 tak mukhyamantri rahe
 After this, again the Congress government was in the state till 26 September
 34 din raashtrapati shashan lagane ke baad rajya main 2014 main hue vidhansabha chunaav ke baad phir se bijepi-shivasena gathbandhan kii sarkaar bani or devendra fadanvis mukhyamantri bane
 These Chief Ministers were removed from the post Sudhakar Naik had to quit as Chief Minister in 1993 after the Mumbai riots
 shivasena pramukh bal thakare se matbhed kii vajah se manohar joshi bhi mukhyamantri pad se hate the
 Similarly, while Vilas Rao Deshmukh was killed due to the 2008 Mumbai terror attack, Ashok Chavan was removed from the Chief Minister's post by the Adarsh society scam
 rajya main sabhi mukhyamantriyon ko kursi barkaraar rakhane ke liye vipaksh hi nahin apni party main bhi sangharsh karnaa padaa
 This is the reason why the Chief Minister keeps changing in the state continuously

 surya ko 'sarvati sakshi bhootam' (sab kuch dekhne vaala) kaha gaya he
 It is said that the Sun God is the witness of every activity and the Lord gets angry with those who do not worship the Sun
 isliye surya bhagwaan ko vaise to kisi kii madad karke yaa shubh karmon ke dwaara bhi prasann kiya ja saktaa he lekin agar upasna karte vakt in mantron kaa jaap kiya jaae to manovanchit fal praapt hote hai
 If to please the Sun God and to get the desired results one should chant some mantras
 surya mantra kaa jaap bahut hi aasaan he
 The best time to chant it is sunrise
 in mantron ko alag-alag 12 mudraon ke saath japa ja saktaa he
 Om Mitraaya Nam: Oom Ravaye Nam: Oom Surya Nam: Oom Bhanve Nam: Oom Pushne Nam: Oom Marichay Nam: Oom Aditya Nam: Oom Bhaskara Raya Nam: Oom Arcay Nam: Oom Khagye Nam: Many fast-festivals are dedicated to Lord Surya
 makar sakranti, rath saptami, chhath or samba dashami main bhagwaan surya kii upasna kii jaati he
 Benefits of Surya Mantra: The Sun is considered part of the soul
 surya mantra kaa jaap karte samay arghya dena or bhi shubh faldaayi hota he
 It also has health benefits
 niyamit taur par surya mantra kaa jaap karne se sharir main urja kaa sanchaar hota he
 
 mantrajaap karte samay surya bhagwaan ko 7 baar arghya dena chahie
 If you want to get more auspicious results, then you should wear red colored clothes
 rugveda kya kahata he-rugveda ke mutabik, suryoday ke vakt uthen vaale vyakti ke sabhi kaary puure hote hai
 All creatures and things in the universe are dependent on the Sun
 surya sabhi ke shaareerik, maansik or aadhyatmik vikaar dur karata he
 The 7 colors of the sun have special significance
 surya mantra kaa jaap karne se in rangon kii urja praapt karne main madad milti he
 Chanting Surya Mantra also helps in increasing intelligence
 arghya kaise den-tambe ke bartan main jal bharen, isamen laal chandan, kumkum or laal rang kaa phool daalen
 At the time of sunrise, offer Arghya by facing towards east
 agar aap surya ko arghya dete samay kisi paudhe kii jad par jal chadhaate hai to or behatar hoga
 Chant the Surya Mantra by taking a copper vessel equal to the height of your head
 mob linching kii badhati ghatnaon ke bich film jagat kii 49 hastiyon ne pradhanmantri narendra modi ko patr likhaa he
 The letter expresses deep concern over the increasing trend of lynchings by mobs in the country
 piem modi ko likhe letters main maniratnam, adur gopalkrishnan, ramchandra guha, anuraag kashyap jaisi hastiyon ke hastakshar hai
 He has demanded PM Modi to create an environment where disagreements are not crushed
 in hastiyon ne kaha he ki asahmati desh ko or taqatvar banaata he
 It is written in this letter that our constitution describes India as a secular republic, where people of every religion, group, gender, caste have equal rights
 is patr main maang kii gai he ki musalamaanon, daliton or duusare alpsankhyakon kii linching turant roki jaae
 In the letter, based on data from the National Crime Records Bureau, it has been said that between 1 January 2009 and 29 October 2018, 254 crimes based on the identity of religion were recorded, killing 91 people and injuring 579 people
 ise bhi padhieh 'jaanaleva' ho saktaa he mob linching main shaamil hona, jaaniye kitne sakht hai kanoon or supreme courtpatr ke mutabik musalmaan jo bharat kii aabaadi ke 14 fisadi he ve aise 62 fisadi aparaadhon kii shikaar bane, jabaki krishchayan, jinka aabaadi main hissaa 2 fisadi he ve aise 14 fisadi aparaadh ke shikaar hue
 The letter said that 90 percent of such crimes took place after May 2014, when Narendra Modi came to power
 patr main likhaa gaya he ki pradhanmantri narendra modi ne sansad main linching kii ghatnaon kii aalochana kii he, lekin ye kaaphi nahin he
 The letter reads, "what action has been taken against those who have committed such crimes, makes us feel that such offenses should be made non-bailable, and the convicts should be punished who become lawless
" jab hatya ke doshiyon ko bina parole ke aaajeevan karawas kii sajaa di ja sakati he to linching ke maamle main aisa kyon nahin ha saktaa he, jo ki or bhi ghrunit aparaadh he? hamaare desh ke kisi naagarik ko dar or khauf main rahane kii jarurat nahin he!"is patr main loktantr main asahmati kii joardaar pairvi kii gai he or kaha gaya he ki asahmati ke bina jamhuriyat fal-phool nahin sakati he
 If someone gives an opinion against the government, it should not be declared 'anti-national' or 'urban naxal'
 sattadhari party kii aalochana karne kaa matlab desh kii aalochana karnaa nahin hota he
 When any party is in power, that party does not become a symbol of the country, it is only one of the many parties in the country
 isliye sarkaar ke khilaaf bolnaa yaa stand lenaa desh virdohi bhavanaaen vyakt karne jaisaa nahin he

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday warned the developed countries moving towards prosperity through fossil fuels that it would be 'morally wrong' if they shifted the burden of reducing emissions to developing countries like India
 unhone 'financial times' ke opinian khand main somvaar ko likhaa, 'sajhi alag-alag jimmedaariyon kaa siddhant hamaare samuhik upkram kaa aadhaar hona chahie
 Apart from this, any other theory would be morally wrong
 ' unhone viksit deshon se kaha ki vejalvaayu parivartanke khilaaf ladaai main adhik boj uthaane ke apane kartavya kaa nirvahan karen
 In an article written in Britain's leading daily newspaper, Modi said, 'some say that modern countries have decided their path towards prosperity through fossil fuels at a time when humanity was not even aware of its impact
 ' yah lekh jalwaayu parivartan parasiopi21 sammelnaki shuruyaat ke samay prakashit hua he
 Modi said, 'since science has moved forward and alternative sources of energy are available
 aise main ve daleel dete hai ki apni vikaas yatra kii shuruyaat bhar karne waalon par un deshon kii tulana main koi kam jimmedaari nahin he, jo tarakkee ke charam par pahunch chuke hai
 However modern countries should bear more responsibility through new awareness
 sirf isliye ki takanic maujuud he

 We must act as trustees and use natural resources wisely
 yah hamaari naitik jimmedaari he ki ham bhavi peedi ke liye ek unnat or samrudh grah chhodkar jaaen
 His statement came against the backdrop of US Secretary of State John Kerry's statement that he said India would be a 'challenge' in the forthcoming climate change to begin in Paris from 30 November as it became more attentive and somewhat more restrained in the new perspective
