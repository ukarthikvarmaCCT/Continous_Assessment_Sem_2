 This was the reason that there was no practice to practice notes in slow voice
 aaj aadhunik sadhano kii madad se fankaar apni aawaaj hi nahin balki apane swar main bhi kai rang bhar sakate hai
 It means to say that today, Funkar can present it in as high a tone as possible, keeping his voice normal or dim or extremely dim
 saar kii soch kaa saar yahi he ki ''vibhinn gharaanon, vibhinn guruon kii behtareen visheshtaon kaa samanvay karo; sangeet kaa mizaaj badal rahaa he
 It will be a blissful experience
 kuch nayaa pesh karne ke liye vikaas kii prakriya se guzarana hi hoga
 "the old trend is changing
 shuddh suron yaa gharaanedaar kii paribhaasha par bane rahanaa mushkil najar aa rahaa he
 In this round of competition, Funkar is intent on doing anything in the race for fame
 kise parvaah he?pehle shagird apane guru ke saath rahete the
 But today this tradition is coming to an end
 aaj guru apane shishyon ke saath sangeet sabhaaon main nahin jate, jabaki pehle ustad vahaan jaakar taiyaari kaa jayja liya karte the
 He did not miss out on pointing out mistakes
 aaj ustad khud hi puri duniya gum rahe hai, aise main bhala shishyon par dhyaan dene kaa samay kahaan se nikaalen? lekin jo samarpit guru hai, ve bhi galtiyaan dikhaane se parhez karne lage hai
 Probably no one wants to get into a relationship
 yahi vajah he ki nayaa pesh karne ke naam par samjhaute hone lage hai
 Sitarist Neeladri Kumar asks, "why do we expect music only to be clean and disciplined?" Today, the guru-shishya tradition has given rise to the training camp system
 pandit jasraj, pandit rajan saajan mishra, pandit hari prasad chaurasia jaise guruon ke paas shishy jate hai, saath rahete hai, sangeet sikhte hai or phir chale jate hai
 By the way, the instrumentalists are always on the journey from one place to another, so their students do not get much connection with their gurus while it is necessary to enhance their skills
 isse sthiti bighad rahi he
 Today, a multi-colored blend of selected features of all the houses is being introduced, it is not possible to separate it
 kisi ubharate hue kalakaar kii pahchaan main chaar chand lagane ke liye 'gharaana’ pratishtha or style ke taur par odha ja rahaa he, bhale uskaa us gharaane se dur kaa bhi naata na ho yaa uske andaaj main gharaanedaar kii koi lau maujuud na ho
 The endurance and concentration of learning from the Guru is over in this jet age
 bas casette suno, kuch acchhee chizon ko yahaan-vahaan se uthaao or paband / sivan lagaakar alaapon ke gole taiyaar karo or barsaanaa shuru karo
 The customs of teaching music have also changed
 bahut-se aise vaadya kalakaar hai jinke shishyon ko apane guruon kii behtareen kala ko seekhney ko kadi mehnat kerani hoti he, par technology kii madad unhen mili hui he
 Students record lessons and take them home
 par yah dekhnaa baaki he ki kya yah rivaaj mahaarathiyon ko janm de rahaa he?guruon ke paas rahete hue varshon riyaj kar apni aawaaj or sangeet style ko nikhaarane ke baad guru kii anumati lekar manch par prastuti ke liye baithne vaali peedi kii jagah ek aisi paudh punap rahi he jo ek anaupchaarik maahaul main vyaktigat prashikshan le rahi he
 Excitement is flying with wings in music schools or campuses of modern gurukuls
 bhala ho in tallent shoj kaa, sabhi apane jivan main kuch behad nayab kar dene ke liye lalayit ho rahe hai or ve kaise ise hasil kar paaenge? pehle unhen shastreey sangeet kii buniyadi shiksha leni hogi or uske baad unhen tallent sho main janaa hoga
 The knock of history is heard
 fusionpurani peedi se ulat aaj kii nai paudh prayog karne, nai vidhaon ko aajamaane or apana dayera badhaane se nahin darati, chaahe vah dancer ho, fankaar ho yaa vadak
 Mediums may vary
 masalan, haal hi dilli main ek samaaroh main niren sengupta, alka raghuvanshi, shridhar ayyar, manisha gavaade or sanjay bhattacharya kii painting ko sadiiyon, stole or tiyon par print kiya gaya
 Her creations were printed on crepe saris and were presented through fashion shows in which dancers like Madhavi Mudgal, Uma Sharma, Kaushalya Reddy and instrumentalists like Madhup Mudgal, Shubhendra Rao, Abhay Rustom Sopori walked the ramp
 or jaanate hai sho stopper koun tha! mahaan nartak pandit birju maharaj
 Before that Dhrupad singers Vasifuddin Dagar and Pandit Hari Prasad Chaurasia have also performed in fashion shows
 aaj reality shoj yaa film shoj main vaadakon yaa danceron kaa jaj bananaa bura nahin mana jaataa
 The sound of changing times is heard clearly and the artists are also happy that they are getting a chance to reach their audiences
 unki jeevanstyli bhi alag rup le rahi he
 Today, he has not tied himself to the role of teaching music to the twelfth
 ve duniya gum rahe hai, videshi vishvavidhyalayon main lacture de rahe hai, kaarykram pesh kar rahe hai
 Their scope has increased
 ve sirf manch par apni kala pesh karte nahin dikhte, balki pej 3 par bhi unase mulaakaat ho jaati he
 Today, no lounge offers liquor in the midst of a round of wine, offering light-hearted classical music
 colaboraton or bandsangit maharathi to bulandiyon par hai lekin nai peedi ab bhi shuddh shastreey sangeet sabhaaon kii baat joh rahi he
 In such a situation, what should emerging music artists or dancers do? In such a situation of confusion, he has taken a unique way
 ve vividh shaileyon ke vaadakon ke saath milakar sangeet ke ek nae bahurangi swaroop ko janm de rahe hai, chaahe yah hindustani ho yaa pashchimi; yaa phir band bana rahe hai
 Such as Kamal Sabri's Sarangi Funk, Neeladri Kumar's Sitar Funk
 bas itnaa he ki aap apane andar akulaate rachanaakaar ko kis had tak udaye ke liye aaazaad karte hai
 However, the association seems to be a little strange for the well-known musicians
 vikhyath santoorvadak pan
 Sivakumar Sharma says, "look, the music will change, of course
" lekin email par sangeet ke colaboraton kii baat meri samaj se pare he
 “due to the development of technotechnology, today musicians are composing music without sitting next to other instrumentalists
 mail ke jariye dhun unke paas pahunch jaati he, jisase ve apni-apni taiyaari kar len or jab aakhri ricarding kaa vakt aata he to sab studio main ikatthe ho jate hai
 This could never have been imagined before
 vaadya kalakaar pehle apane hunar ko dikhaane ke liye net kaa istemaal nahin karte the
 Today every instrumental artist has his own website in which he has given all the details about himself
 yah ek aisa shashakït saadhan he, jiske jariye aap apni kaabiliyat puri duniya ko dikhaa sakate hai
 Radical changes are visible in the values of our era
 jindagi teji se bhaag rahi he or isi ke saath samaaj, samskruti or aarthik pahaluon main gaharaa parivartan dikh rahaa he
 Who can assure that the smell of the houses will remain? The imagination of the incoming is hurting that the storm of change should not erase everything
 dil thamkar suniye! Delhi's Human Development Report was released on Saturday
 iskaa naam vikaas report he, lekin hakeekat yah he ki iske har panne par dilli kii dikkatein darj he

 The report said that children, elderly women, are not safe in Delhi

 On the occasion of the release of the Human Resource Development Report, the Chief Minister could not stop herself from making claims by stealing the face of all these truths, but the matter went ahead by avoiding the open pole in the report

 On the question of PM Modi's promises to take strict action against Pakistan before the election, Mahesh Giri said that it is the effect of PM Modi's toughness, which reduced the incidents of our soldiers who were being beheaded earlier
 is
 'jald dikhegaa bharat kii sakhti kaa asar'giri ne bataaya ki piem kii ore se kai maukon par pakistan ko kadaa sandesh diya gaya he, lekin uri jaisi ghatnaon ke baad pakistan ke khilaaf karrwai se pehle soch samajhakar nirnay liya janaa he ormodi sarkaaraskht kadam uthaaegi

 Amethi of Uttar Pradesh is considered to be a strong fort of Congress
 bijepi modi lahar main bhi congress ke is kile ko bhed nahin pai thi
 However, for the last five years, BJP has been making efforts to surround Congress President Rahul Gandhi in Amethi
 is kadi main pradhanmantri banane ke baad pehali baar narendra modi ravivaar ko gandhi parivaar ke siyaasi garh amethi pahunche
 He laid the foundation stone for the new unit of the indo-russian Ordinance Factory at Munshiganj, where the AK-203 Morden rifles will be made
 ise bijepi kaa congress adhyaksh ko unke 'ghar' main gherne kii ranneeti kaa hissaa mana ja rahaa he
 Actually, the political soil of Amethi is such, which only recognizes the seed of Congress
 isliye chunaav ke mausam main jab gandhi parivaar kaa beej daal diya jaataa he to vipakshi dalon kii sari fasal nasht ho jaati
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, in front of Rahul Gandhi, BJP fielded Smriti Irani and AAP Kumar Kumar Vishwas
 modi lahar par savaar hone ke baavjood bijepi amethi main camel khilaane se maharoom rah gai thi
 Even after this, the BJP made Smriti Irani a minister in the Modi government
 amethi congress kaa gaalmethi 1967 main loksabhaa seat bani
 Since then there have been 15 general elections and by-elections, of which Congress has won 13 times and members of the Gandhi family have been mps 9 times
 1977 main lokdal or 1998 main bijepi ko jeet mili he
 Sanjay Singh, who won from BJP, is now in the Congress camp
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi amethi sansadeey seat se teesri baar saansad hai
 Rahul, who won in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections by a margin of about one lakh four lakhs, was able to win in 2014 with only one lakh votes from Smriti Irani
 bijepi mahaj ek baar hi is seat par chunaav jeet chuki he
 Since 2014, the BJP has been working on the strategy of defeating Rahul Gandhi in his own fortress through Smriti Irani
 yahi vajah he ki loksabhaa chunaav haarane ke baad bhi smriti irani amethi main sakriy hai
 Irani is constantly visiting Amethi
 itnaa hi nahin bijepi adhyaksh amit shah, yogi adityanath samet bijepi ke kai diggaj amethi kaa daura kar chuke hai
 However, the political and political equations of Amethi are such, where it is not easy to beat Rahul Gandhi
 vipaksh kaa haath rahul ke saathutar pradesh main sapa-basapa ne bhale hi congress ke saath gathbandhan na kiya ho, lekin amethi main wo rahul gandhi ke saath hai
 Here SP-BSP alliance has decided not to field candidates against Congress President
 isse rahul gandhi kii raah kaa aasaan kar diya he
 Currently, Amethi is a SP MLA in the Lok Sabha constituency
 iske alaava sapa-basapa kaa apana votbank bhi he
 In such a situation, it is not easy for the BJP to distinguish Rahul Gandhi's fort
 jaateey sameekaran congress ke paksh mechamethi loksabhaa seat par dalit or muslim matadaata kingmekar kii bhoomika hai
 The Muslim voters in this seat are around 4 lakh and there are about three and a half lakh Dalit voters
 iske alaava dhai lakh ke kareeb yadav, paune do lakh rajput or dhed lakh ke kareeb brahman voter hai
 Apart from this, Kurmi, Mallah and Lodh voters are also well in OBC
 congress ko sapa-basapa ke samarthan se dalit, yadav or muslim vot rahul gandhi ke saath ekamusth jane kii sambhaavna he
 Apart from this, Brahmins are traditional voters of Congress
 rajput matadaataaon ko saadhane ke liye rahul gandhi ne dow
 Sanjay Singh and MLC Deepak Singh are engaged
 aise jaateey sameekaran bhi rahul ke paksh main najar aa rahaa he
 There is a considerable difference in the voting trends in the Assembly and Lok Sabha elections
 2017 ke vidhansabha main bhale hi bijepi amethi sansadeey kshetra ke tahat aane vaali paanch vidhansabha siton main se chaar jeetne main safal rahi thi
 SP has got one seat
 vidhansabha chunaav main bhale hi congress kaa amethi main khaataa na khulaa ho
 But whether similar results will be there in Lok Sabha elections, it is difficult to say
 bijepi ko camel khilaane kii ummidarahul ke garh main bijepi 2019 main chunavi fasal lahalhane kii har sambhav koshish main juty he
 Even after losing the 2014 elections, Union Minister Smriti Irani is coming to Amethi almost every month and is pushing the development works with the help of Central and State Government schemes
 bijepi loksabhaa chunaav main congress ke is kile ko bhedane kii kavayad main is sansadeey kshetra main kiye gaye vikaas kaaryon ko bhunaane kii koshish main juty he
 The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has decided to lend three billion dollars to Egypt
 misr ke vitt mantri samir radwan ne kaha ki mudra kosh yah udhaar july se shuru ho rahe vitt varsh 2011-12 ke liye manjuur karegaa
 Radwan said that the rate of interest on borrowings is 1
 5 fisadi hogi jo saamaanya taur par imef dwaara lee jane vaali saat fisadi kii byaaj dar se kam he
 In a statement released on Sunday, the IMAF said that the borrowings were part of international aid to Egypt's economic development
 farvari main tatkaaleen raashtrapati husnee mubarak ke khilaaf hue jabardast virodh pradarshan ke baad misr kii arthvyastha kii sthiti kaaphi kharaab ho gai thi
 Egypt also from World Bank 2
 2 arab dollar kaa rin milegaa
 For the government, embarrassment arose in the Rajya Sabha today when an amendment of the opposition on the issue of corruption and black money on the motion of thanks on the President's address was approved in the Upper House
 haalanki pradhanmantri ne corporate samarthak hone tathaa bhoomi vidheyak main kisaan samarthak kisi bhi praavdhaan ko halkaa karne ke aaropon ko sire se khaarij kar diya
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi also ruled out any decision to reduce population coverage under the Food Security Act, saying that this cheeky fantasy should not be publicized
 kaala dhan ke mudde par modi ne congress ko nishaanaa banaate hue kaha ki uski sarkaar ne vishesh jaanch dal kaa gathan hi nahin kiya, kyonki yah kisi ko bachaane kaa prayaas tha
 Yechury had moved the amendment proposal, alleging that the Congress government had mimicked the plans of the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government, on allegations of copying the UPA government's schemes
 rajyasabha main sarkaar ke paas bahumat nahin he or ucch sadan main aaj uske liye tab gahari sharmindagi kii sthiti utpann ho gai jab raashtrapati ke abhibhaashan par dhanyavad prastaav par vipaksh dwaara laae gaye sanshodhan ko sadan ne manjuuri pradaan kar di
 The amendment was introduced by CPI-M members Sitaram Yechury and p Rajiv
 sadan ne mat vibhaajan ke baad ise manjuur kar liya
 Earlier, the government appealed to the opposition to withdraw its amendment and not insist on division of votes
 sanshodhan ko 57 ke mukaable 118 maton se manjuur kar liya gaya
 This is the fourth time in the history of Rajya Sabha when the House has approved the amendment brought by the opposition on the motion of thanks on the President's address
 pehali baar janata party ke shashan kaal main 30 janvari 1980 ko aisa hua tha
 It was followed in 1989 when the VP Singh-led National Front was in power
 teesri baar 12 march 2001 ko aisa hua tha, jab atal bihari vaajapeyi nit rajg sarkaar satta main thi
 Parliamentary Affairs Minister m Venkaiah Naidu requested Yechury not to insist on amendment and said black money has been mentioned
 unhone kaha ki unki chintaaon ko note kiya gaya he or isliye ise waapas le lenaa chahie
 Naidu's attempt was not successful
 Sainaidu tried to stop Yechury from insisting on amendments, saying the government was trying to bring in black money and there were no two opinions on the issue
 unhone yechuri se anurodh kiya, aapako adhikaar he
 Your concerns are understandable, but you do not insist on division, but Yechury did not accept this request
 unhone kaha ki saamaanya sthiti main vah sahamat ho jate
 He said that he is insisting on the amendment, as the government has left no option and the Opposition was not given a chance to seek clarification on the Prime Minister's reply
 unhone kaha, yahaan tak ki vipaksh ke netaa ko bhi mauka nahin diya gaya
 He also objected to going out of the House soon after Prime Minister Narendra Modi gave his answer
 sanshodhan main kaha gaya he ki abhibhaashan main ucch stareey bhrashtachar par kaabo paane or kalaadhan waapas laae jane ke maamle main sarkaar kii naakaami kaa koi zikr nahin kiya gaya he
 The latest developments underscored that the government may face difficulties in getting its major economic reform bills passed by the Upper House
 hangaame ke bich congress ke ramchandra raav ne apane sthaan par khadey hokar ek binar dikhaaya
 To this, Chairman Hamid Ansari objected that he would be forced to ask the member to go out
 baad main raav maan gaye or apni seat par baith gaye
 Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said that as far as clarification is concerned, it was never allowed
 is par yechuri ne jawaab diya ki ek sadsy ke naate unhen apane adhikaar ke bare main jaankaree he
 Ansari said that if the members insist on division of votes, the posture cannot be ruled out
 isse pehle, raashtrapati abhibhaashan par dhanyavad prastaav par hui charchaa kaa jawaab dete hue modi ne vipaksh ke is aarope ko sire se khaarij kar diya ki unki sarkaar karporate samarthak he
 He said that his government has started many schemes like Jan Dhan Yojana, Swachh Bharat, Soil Health Card, Toilets for girls in government schools and Housing for all
 kya in kaaryakramon se amiron ko laabh hoga yaa garibon ko? vivaadaaspad bhoomi adhigrahan vidheyak main badlaav ke liye sahamat hone kaa sanket dete hue pradhanmantri ne kaha ki kisaanon ko jameen ke muaavje ke praavdhaan main soot bhar badlaav nahin kiya gaya he or agar isamen kisaanon ke khilaaf ek bhi cheez he to vah use badalane ko taiyaar he
 The Prime Minister, in response to a discussion on the President's address to the Rajya Sabha, appealed to the opposition on the Land Acquisition Bill where the ruling coalition does not have a majority
 modi ne kaha, yah varishthajanon kaa sadan he or bhoomi adhigrahan vidheyak ke bare main kai chintaaen vyakt kii gai
 i have been saying since the first day that if there are any shortcomings in it, then fix it
 agar koi kamiyaan hai to ham jaruri sudhaar karne ko taiyaar hai
 He said that in the previous bill we also supported
 agar vah acha tha tab hamen uskaa shrey nahin den, lekin koi kamiyaan hai to us paap ke bhagidaar ham bhi hai
 The provision of getting land in the previous law was not effective, so how would the development work of schools, defense establishment etc
 be carried forward
 modi ne kaha, kisaanon ke khilaaf ek bhi cheez he to main use badalane ke liye taiyaar hum
 If there are any shortcomings, remove it together and pass it
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki samprag sarkaar ke kaarykaal ke dauraan paarit khaadya suraksha kanoon ko lekar bhi dushprachaar kiya ja rahaa he
 He said that the government has not taken any decision to reduce the coverage population under this scheme from 67 percent
 ise 40 fisadi nahin kiya ja rahaa he
 Do not propagate like this
 kaale dhan ke mudde par congress par nishaanaa sadhate hue modi ne kaha ki purvavati sarkaar ne varsh 2011 main vishesh jaanch dal kaa gathan nahin kiya
 This happened because it was an attempt to save someone
 kaale dhan ke khilaaf karrwai karne ke naam par dhamkaane ke sarkaar par lage congress ke aaropon ko khaarij karte hue modi ne apatkaal kii yaad karte hue kaha ki usase bada khatra kya ho saktaa he
 He said that when he was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, he was threatened with being sent to jail
 ek ghante se adhik lambey bhaashan main modi ne samprag sarkaar ke kaarykaal kii yojanaon ke saath tulana karte hue is aalochana ko nakaar diya ki nau maheene main unki sarkaar ne aisa kuch nahin kiya jo najar aae

 Then both of them vowed to stay together for the rest of their life promising to marry each other

 Sometime suddenly, Danish realizes that Barkha's relationship is fixed somewhere else

 He eats the poison, but before eating the poison, he calls Barkha one last time and tells him that he will not be able to live without him

 Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal is busy in ending the court case by apologizing constantly
 isi kadi main kejariwal ne vitt mantri arun jetali se bhi maafee maangi he
 After this, on Tuesday, posters were seen under different traffic signals (U turn) of Delhi
 in posters ke madhyam se kejariwal par nishaan saadhaa gaya tha
 Tell us what is written in the poster, these posters were planted by BJP MLA Manjinder Singh Sirsa
 in par likhaa tha- 'kejriwal Turn NOT ALLOWED
 'all these posters were placed under the sign board which read, u TURN NOT ALLOWED
 kejariwal kii maafee dar maafigauratlab he ki arvind kejariwal ne sabase pehle punjab ke purv mantri bicrim singh majithia se maaphi maangi thi
 Since then, Kejriwal has also apologized to Union Minister Nitin Gadkari and Congress leader Kapil Sibal for getting rid of defamation cases against him
 majithia se maaphi ke khilaaf kai aap netaaon ne bhi kejariwal kii aalochana kii thi
 Is this the real reason for the apology? 1
 sanghathan kii chintayah siem kejariwal kii khaas ranneeti ho sakati he
 The leadership has decided that the defamation lawsuits on all the leaders should be abolished as soon as possible
 iske liye maafee bhi maangani pade, to bhi ve taiyaar hai
 Aam Aadmi leaders are unable to pay attention to the expansion of the party due to defamation lawsuits
 kai rajyon main sanghathan badhanaa he
 Lok Sabha elections are to be held next year in 2019
 2
 In the event of the party not being able to produce sufficient evidence in cases of defamation, it will have to pay heavy damages or go to jail
 aam aadmi party ne arvind kejariwal ko hi desh bhar main cheharaa banaaya he or aise main jab manahani cese kii musiibat main khud arvind kejariwal funs jaaen to lagaataar tut rahi party kaa bhavishya khatre main pad saktaa he

 louis suarej ke donon half main kiye gaye do chamatkaarik gol kii badaulat do baar ke champion urugway ne dakshin korea ko 2-1 se petakar 40 saal baad vishwa cap footbal ke quarter final main jagah banaayi
 Suarez scored goals in the eighth and 80th minutes for Uruguay, while Chungyong scored the only goal for South Korea, who played the semi-finals of the 2002 World Cup
 is match ke vijeta kaa saamana america or ghana ke bich aaj hone vaale duusare pre quarter final match ke vijeta se hoga
 Taking full advantage of South Korea's poor goalkeeping and poor defense, Uruguay took the lead in the eighth minute
 palermo ke farward edinson kawani ne diego forlan ko gend saunpi or atletico madrid ke is striker ne baayen flank se suarej ko paas diya jisane gol karne main koi chook nahin kii
 Earlier, South Korea would have made the lead in the fifth minute when Park Chu Young's brilliant freekick left Uruguay goalkeeper Fernando Mouslera from the right post
 korian golkeeper jung sung riyong is gol ko bachaa sakate the lekin unhone riflaction main kaaphi susti dikhaai
 Dutch club Ajax striker Suarez, who scored the winning goal in the league stage against Mexico, also scored in the second half to take his goal to three in the World Cup
 duusare half main korian team ne palatwaar kii koshish kii lekin urugway kaa dephence chattan kii tarah adig tha jisane lig charan main ek bhi gol nahin ganvaaya he
 Meanwhile in the fourth minute of the second half, Suarez again came close to scoring the goal but missed his target
 iske do minute baad korea ke chungyog kaa shaat bhi gol ke baahar se nikal gaya
 The next minute Korea had the easiest chance to score an equalizer when Uruguay's Lugano hit a header to send the ball out of the circle but the ball was caught by the Korean striker Chungyong inside
 unke paas nishaanaa saadhane ke liye samay bhi tha lekin gol karne kii hadabadi main vah chuke or korea ke haath se mauka nikal gaya
 However, Chungyong rectified the mistake in the 68th minute
 sung yiong kii freekik par unhone barabari kaa gol dagkar korian kheme ko muskuraane kaa mauka diya
 Three minutes later, however, he missed the opportunity to score again, leaving South Korea out of the lead
 jabardast farm main chal rahe suarej ne 80wein minute main ek darshneey gol karke urugway ko 2-1 se badhat dilaa di
 Suarez scored a very strong shot from the right foot on a pass from the left side, which can be counted in the best goals of the tournament
 aakhri minuton main urugway ne puraa jor dephence par diya or iskaa phayda bhi mila jab dakshin korea kii vaapasi kii har koshish naakaam ho gai

 India is a country made up of 28 different states which have different identities, but one thing can be seen equally that they have rode the boat of their respective specialties and development of the advancing cities
 pragati ke in sutaradhaaron ne bhartiya arthvyavastha kii puri tasviir hi badal daali he
 Different characteristics and environment of these cities are attracting companies
 yah paaya gaya he ki vibhinn kshetron kii companiyon ne vividh sambhaavnaaon kii talash karne ke liye kareeb 5,000 shaharon or mahanagaron kaa rukh kiya he
 These cities have the ability to meet the demands of the business world and they have provided them a comfortable and good environment for doing business
 ye logon ko bhi apni ore aakarshith kar rahe hai or rashtriya or antarrashtriya nivesh ke liye rasta dikhaa rahe hai
 The newly emerging centers of these cities help them to focus on their specificity and economic activities along with the advantages being available at the local level which opens the way for the cluster
 cluster nai baton or pratispardhaa ko bal dete hai jo vyavsaayikta ke liye damdaar jameen taiyaar karte hai
 Chandigarh is a city that is situated between Haryana, Punjab and Himachal Pradesh, hence it is a favorite place for both job seekers and job seekers
 isi tarah punjab ke do shahar ludhiana or amritsar bhi teji ke saath pragati kii raah par nikal pade hai
 Construction of clusters basically plays the role of assembling workers and machinery in one place
 jaise gudgaanv, jo pichley dashak main shashakt centre ke taur par ubhara he
 It emerged as one of the important industrial sectors associated with auto subsidiaries and garments and created a spate of employment opportunities
 iskaa padosi shahar faridabad bhi isi ke saath kadamtal karata chal rahaa he
 His story is also similar to this
 lekin iske udyog chemical, fabrication or ejineering se jude hai
 Huda has announced the development of 80 new areas in the city, as its population is increasing by 55 per cent every year
 is tarah yah shahar teji se bad to rahaa he par iske vikaas kii kahani main shrey kaa palada badhati hui aabaadi kii ore jhuk rahaa he, jisaki jaruraton or unase jude avasaron kii purti ke liye ye saare prayaas kiye gaye
 The emergence of these city centers and their development will have a strong impact on the big companies, which will eventually raise the eyes of the people and this will result that this area will climb the steps of development in every way and will also attract people from the residential perspective
 
 isi tarah rajasthan ke gulabi shahar jaipur ne apane sthaneey utpaadon ko hastshilp or paperboard ikaayiyon ke yogadan se sajaakar bazaar main mashhoor kar diya
 Concepts of the cluster were introduced by Harvard professor Michael Porter in the early 1990s
 isane apni chata uttar pradesh main dikhaai jab vahaan aarthik vikaas sansthaaon ne khaas audyogic kshetron main aarthik gatividhi ke vyaavhaarik centre ko taiyaar karnaa shuru kar diya tha
 Be it Agra or Lucknow, Kanpur, Varanasi or Gorakhpur, the government has tried to give a new look and identity to these cities by paying special attention to them
 pehle inaki ginati saadhaaran shaharon main hoti thi
 But today, well-known companies are turning to them
 noida or gajiabad aise do shahar hai jinhen sarkaar ke prayaas ne nikharaa or buland shakhsiyat di
 Today, as a national capital region, these places are getting more attention from people and industries
 yahaan real estate main jo baadh dikh rahi he uskaa kahana hi kya
 Its boundaries have now spread to Greater Noida and Indirapuram
 pragati ke haath ab bagal ke rajya uttarakhand ke shaharon ko bhi sajaane-sanvaarane lage hai
 Dehradun, formerly known only as a tourist destination, today has become a symbol of development of the state along with Rudrapur
 2012 kii shuruyaat main madhya pradesh sarkaar ne bhopal ke mandideep, indore ke pithampura or gwalior ke malanpur jaise pehle se sthapit audyogic kendron ke vikaas ke liye 3,022 karod ru
 Had made a big plan to spend Rs
 isi tarah rajya ke anya maujuuda audyogic ilaake jaise jabalpur niveshkon or un udyogpatiyon ko apane yahaan jagah or maahaul dene par dhyaan de rahe hai jo vahaan udyogon ko lagaana chaahate hai
 Patna, for which part has been criticized, has been showing a new image in recent times by rapidly developing infrastructure, service sector
 desh ke pehle nijee ispaat or steel city jamshedpur ne rashtriya arthvyavastha main 8,000 karod ru
 Has contributed
 is tarah ke kai anya udhaaharan audyogic kendron kii maujuudagi kii ore ishaara karte hai jinhone us kshetra ko khushhaal or samrudh bana diya he
 The business related to farming and food processing of Raipur has contributed a lot to the country's economy
 isane na sirf shahar kaa rup-rang badal diya he, balki yahaan kii utpaadakta or sampurna vikaas ko bhi aage badhaayaa he
 We can say that these cluster areas are positively impacting industrial and socio-economic development
 samay aa gaya he ki vikaas ke pankh lagaakar aasmaan choote in shaharon ko saraahaa jaae jisase in ubharate mahanagaron kii gati ko bal mili taaki har ek kii khaasiyat ko pahchaan kar or unke kal or aaj kaa akalan karte hue bhavi bashindon kii apekshaaon par dhyaan diya ja sake
 a cluster-based system will open the doors of competition, leading to growth and progress from closed quarters in states and territories

 darasal, congress ne prasad kaa ek video saarvajanik kiya he jisamen vah hafiz said ko ‘‘hafiz ji'' kehete hue najar aa rahe hai

 ' loksabhaa chunaav se pehle uttar pradesh main samaajawaadee party or bahujan samaaj party ke bich gathbandhan ke baad donon dalon ke sheersh netaa janata ko rijhaane ke liye saajha reliyaan bhi karne ja rahe hai
 Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati are going to do 11 rallies across the state together
 haalanki, in saajha reliyon ke bare main ek sawaal yah bhi uth rahaa he ki 11 main se 9 saajha raily samaajawaadee party ke garh main kyon ho rahi he
 According to the program announced by the alliance, the joint rallies of SP President Akhilesh Yadav, BSP chief Mayawati and RLD chief Chaudhary Ajit Singh will start from 7 April on the auspicious days of Navratri, which will run till 16 May
 gathbandhan kii ore se kii ja rahi saajha reliyon main mainpuri, kannauj, badaayun, firozabad or azamgarh wo siten hai jo philhal yadav parivaar ke paas hai or aadhi saajha reliyaan inhen siton par ho rahi hai
 Out of the 11 shared rallies, Saharanpur and Agra are just two seats which are in the BSP quota, but what is the reason for more than 80 per cent rallies in sp's stronghold? No pique! Experts say that this discussion so far It is common that the Samajwadi Party's votebank will not stand for Mayawati so strongly as Mayawati's votebank can vote for the Samajwadi Party at her behest
 mulaayam singh yadav, ramgopal yadav, dimple yadav, ajam khan jaise parivaar ke log or parivaar ke karibiyon ke liye raily kar mayawati yah sandesh dena chaahati hai ki yadav parivaar se unke puraane matbhed khatm ho chuke hai or ab donon main rishte madhur hai or koi manmutav nahin he
 On the other hand, according to BJP spokesperson Rakesh Tripathi, it is Akhilesh Yadav's desperation and fear of elections that is forcing him to hold Mayawati's rallies in his own and family's area
 is bijepi netaa ke mutabik sapa kii haalat yah he ki vah har haal main kam se kam apane parivaar kii seat bachaana chaahate hai or isiilie aadhi se zyada saajha reliyaan sirf sapa ke ilaake main ho rahi hai
 Rampur, Faizabad, Gorakhpur, Varanasi, Saharanpur and Agra are seats that are out of the Yadav family, but what message does Mayawati's campaign provide for SP alone? Mayawati's use! According to BJP leader Chandramohan for the last time in Modi wave The Samajwadi Party had saved its clan, but this time the credibility of the entire clan is at stake as Mayawati is not fighting herself and the Yadav family once again In the field, such looks difficult to win elections family in this second Modi so try Socialist Party met just save the family and it is being used to Mayawati
 haalanki reliyon ke bare main samaajawaadee party ke pravaktaa sunil saajan kaa kahana he ki saajha raily ke liye sthalon kaa chayan bhugolic paristhiti ko dekhakar tay kiya gaya he
 Even though 9 out of 11 rallies are being held in the Samajwadi Party constituency, the BSP is contesting the adjoining seats and separate rallies can be held separately if needed
 baharhaal, sapa or basapa kii is saajha raily ko lekar kaaryakartaaon main kitna utsaah he
 It will be known during the rally, but it has been decided that after the Samajwadi Party alliance, now Mayawati wants to try her power first in her own house

 bhagwaan krishna kii badi murti haath main liye sudarshan chakra ke saath kurukshetra main hogi

 Due to which the community advocated by him can remove the tag of support and the scattered OBC castes can join them again

 bhartiya janata party ke varisht netaa laalkrishna adwani ko gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi se zyada madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan kya bhaae, endie kaa ahm ghatak dal janata dal united kii maanon baanche khil gayi
 JDU openly attacked Advani and attacked Modi
 is bayaan kaa sahaara lekar jediu modi kii piem ummidavaari ke daawey ko ek baar phir khaarij kar diya
 JDU leader Ali Anwar said, 'I absolutely agree with Advani's statement
 gujarat pehle se viksit tha
 So what made Narendra Modi so special? Adding tone to Advani, the JDU leader said that Madhya Pradesh has done more commendable work than Gujarat on the criteria of development
 modi par nishane sadhate hue unhone kaha, hamaare netaa nitish kumaar pehle hi kah chuke hai ki sampradayik vichaardhaara vaale netaaon ko desh bardaasht nahin karegaa
 i am happy that BJP as well as the country agrees with our view
 gauratlab he ki adwani ne madhyapradesh ke mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan kii purv pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi se tulana karte hue donon ko ahankaar se pare bataaya jabaki unhone vikaas ke liye shivaraj kii tulana gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi se kii
 In the gestures, Shivraj Singh Chauhan was also said to be better than Modi
 adwani ne nagar-gram kendron ke paalkon or sanyojakon ke sammelan ke samaapan ke avasar par kaha ki vaajapeyi ne apane kaarykaal main (jab vaajapeyi pradhanmantri the) main pradhanmantri gram sadak yojana, rashtriya rajmargon kaa nirmaan or unnayan, parmaanu pareekshan, kisaan credit card se lekar anek yojanayen shuru kin lekin hameshaa ve ahankaar se dur rahe
 Advani said that similarly Chauhan implemented many welfare schemes including Ladli Laxmi and Chief Minister Teerth Darshan for the welfare of the public
 unhone kaha ki shivaraj singh kii kalpanashiltaa se madhyapradesh vikaas kii nai bulandia hasil kar rahaa he
 Delhi is far away for Modi
 adwani ne ye nahin kaha ki wo ritair ho rahe hai
 Advani has not even said that he is not in pm's race
 aise maukey par jab hafte bhar main bijepi kii kaaryakarini kii baithak hone vaali ho tab adwani kaa ye bayaan yun hin nahin ho saktaa
 The political meaning of this statement will be derived
 shivasena ke mukhpatr saamana ke sampadakeey main kaha gaya he ki pakistan ke saath kisi prakaar kii shanti vaarta nahin kii ja sakati
 The editorial has recorded protests over the incident in which Indian diplomats were mistreated during the Iftar party
 saamana main kaha gaya he ki bhartiya rajanyikon ke saath jis prakaar kaa bartaav kiya gaya vah manjuur karne laayak nahin he
 It has been written in the editorial that 'pakistan's condition has become like a drunk monkey
 islamabad main hindostani ucchayukta kii iftaar party main madamast bandaron ke machaae gaye kolahal asahneeya hai
 This iftar party was organized on Saturday evening in Islamabad
 uske liye aae mehmaanon ke saath pakistani adhikariyon ne ashobhaneey bartaav kiya
 The invited guests were stopped at the hotel gate
 kai logon ko dhamkaakar waapas lautaa diya gaya
 It has been written in the editorial that after the Balakot air strike, the Modi government has crushed the sting of the Pakis but the tail is still fluttering
 us poonch kaa bhi ab bandobast karnaa padegaa
 Hindusthan avenged the Pulwama attack
 pakiyon ke ghar main ghuskar aatankwaadi maare, unke addon ko dhwast kiya
 Since then Pakistan was tolerating punishing blows
 upar se hindostaan kii raajnneetik mashinari ne jor lagaate hue masood ajahar ko antarrashtriya aatankwaadi ghoshit karaayaa
 With a cracked mouth, it was difficult for the Pakis to come in front of the world
 us par modi sarkaar ek baar phir bahumat se satta main aa gai
 The editorial further wrote that it is difficult to handle Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan with this shock
 imran ne modi ko jeet kii shubhakamanaayen deen
 In the same way, two countries should work together on development and peace, he has expressed this feeling, but in reality what was done on the occasion of Iftar party in Islamabad, consider it as a step taken for the peace process? The pretense of Pakistan has once again come to the fore
 pakistan kisi bhi tarah kii charchaa karne yogya desh nahin
 The invitees for the Iftar party organized by the Hindustani High Commissioner were all 'well-known' people of Islamabad
 usamen varisht patrkaar, lekhak, vichaarak, kalakaar or prashasnic adhikariyon kaa samavesh tha
 The main thing is that they were all Pakistani citizens
 is party ke liye masood ajahar chhap jaise logon ko nahin bulaayaa gaya
 Probably Pakistan should have got angry about this
 in sabhi aamantriton ko hotel main pravesh karne se roka gaya
 After the Pathankot attack, all kinds of discussions and dealings between the two countries are closed, trade is closed
 khel or saanskrithik sambandh tut gaya he
 Regarding Pakistan, China is also on the fence today, this is clear from the case of Azhar Masood
 pakistan karj ke boj tale kuchlaa gaya he or aatankwaadiyon ke nange naach ke kaaran vahaan ek tarah kii araajaktaa faili hui he
 Pakistan is not a country but a 'factory' of global terrorism
 iesai or pakistani fouj milakar pakistan par niyantran rakh rahe hai
 Imran Khan is the Prime Minister who has chosen the path of democracy, it is an illusion
 'saamana main likhaa gaya he ki 'pakistan ke paas netritv nahin he, na hi disha he isiilie islamabad main shanivaar ko jo kuch bhi ghatit hua vaise maamle ghatit hote rahete hai
 The Iftar party of the Pakistan High Commissioner to Delhi was controlled by the Hindustan government as the red carpet was laid for the separatists of Kashmir in that party
 maharashtra ke pune main ek bhaashan ke dauraan rakshaamantri manohar parrikar ne kaha ki modi sarkaar ne sargical strike karke dushmano ko unki jagah dikhaa di
 Parrikar hoped that in the Municipal Corporation elections, the public would also vote for BJP candidates by surgical strike
 nagar nigam chunaav ke liye bhaajapa ummidavaaron kii prachaar sabha ke liye rakshaamantri parrikar pune ke kareeb pimpadi chinchvaad aae the
 Targeting the Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray and NCP leader Ajit Pawar directly, Parrikar said that when it comes to the security of the country, our government showed the enemies of the natural strike in their place and now the second surgical strike should be in Maharashtra as well and This public will do
 parrikar nekaha, 'kuch din pehle yahaan uddhav thakare aae the
 He sparked a lot of fire against BJP and Ajit Pawar on the other side is also commenting BJP

 The corporate was investigating this case and was preparing to take action on the company of Anuj and Alok Saxena that in the last stage the file reached the Director General BK Bansal
 anuj saxena ne apni pahunch ke jariye bansal ko sampark kiya or 20 lakh me sauda tay ho gaya jisaki final kist lete vakt bansal ko sibiai ne giraftaar kar liya
 The CBI arrested Alok Saxena, brother of middleman Vishwajeet and Anuj Saxena and joint MD of Elder Pharma in this case but Anuj Saxena escaped

 If Anujasutra is believed to have escaped from abroad, Anuj is trying to run away with the whole family, so of course the CBI may have patted Bansal on his arrest for a bribe of just 9 lakhs but if the real fish of this game is Anuj Saxena If the CBI does not get caught soon, then the investors will have to lose Rs 150 crore

 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar is said to have liked his counterpart Akhilesh Yadav in the neighboring state of Uttar Pradesh, and that is why he has given the young chief minister a support as well as a friendly advice to win the election - enforce prohibition 
 
 
 uttar pradesh main agle saal kii shuruyaat main hone vaale behad ahm vidhansabha chunaav se kuch hi maheene pehle is vakt 44-varshiya akhilesh yadav ko apane chachaa shivpal yadav se 'takat' kii ladaai main jute rahanaa pad rahaa he, or ab tak akhilesh ke pita tathaa samaajawaadee party ke mukhiya mulaayam singh yadav bhi bete kii jagah bhai kaa saath dete nazar aa rahe hai
 
 
 Speaking about the 'war' continued 'publicly' in the 'first Family' of Uttar Pradesh, Nitish Kumar said, "akhilesh ji is the young face of politics, and if he could muster the courage to introduce liquor ban in Uttar Pradesh
 If they are, they will not need anyone's support and canopy to win the assembly elections
 
 
 " Nitish Kumar clearly said that if Akhilesh Yadav declares liquor ban in UP, he will not hesitate to support him
 pichley saal sharabbandi kaa vaada kar mahila votaron ke shandaar samarthan se lagaataar teesri baar bihar ke mukhyamantri bane nitish kumaar ne kaha, "khatra uthaae bina kuch bhi hasil nahin kiya ja saktaa, so, jab tak aap kuch bada faisla nahin karte, bade rajnatik lakshyon ko hasil karnaa mumkin nahin

 In fact, Mulayam Singh Yadav shied away from the anti-bjp grand alliance formed under Nitish's leadership at the last moment, saying that his party was not being given enough seats to fight

 This time, 44-year-old Akhilesh Yadav is facing a battle of 'strength' with his uncle Shivpal Yadav, just a few months before the very important assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh early next year, and till now Akhilesh's father And Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav is also seen supporting his brother instead of his son
 
 
 uttar pradesh ke 'pratham parivaar' main 'saarvajanik rup se' jari 'jang' ko lekar apni baat rakhte hue nitish kumaar ne kaha, "akhilesh ji raajnneeti kaa yuva cheharaa hai, or yadi vah uttar pradesh main sharabbandi lagu karne kii himmat juta pate hai, to unhen vidhansabha chunaav jeetne ke liye kisi ke samarthan or chhatrachhaya kii zarurat nahin padegi

" Is not possible to achieve 
 
 " Nitish Kumar may seem to like Akhilesh Yadav, but his attachment and support for Akhilesh's father, Mulayam Singh Yadav, is not the same as he got "messed up" during the Samajwadi Party's electoral alliance in Bihar last year

 Nitish Kumar has categorically ruled out the possibility of partnering with the Samajwadi Party in UP, although his ally Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) chief Lalu Prasad Yadav has said in Bihar that he would not field any candidate in Uttar Pradesh Mulayam Singh will help Yadav 'in favor of secular forces'

 com / jxu5bjnvo7 libya main vidrohiyon ne gaddaphi ke campus bab-al-azijia par kabja kar vahaan apana jhanda fahraa diya he
 The rebels have broken the statue of Colonel Gaddafi
 vidrohiyon ne ek or janemaane pratik ko tod diya jisamen ek america jahaaj ko sunahare rang kii muththi main pakade hue dikhaaya gaya he assi ke dashak main karnal gaddaphi ke parisar main america hawaii hamale kii yaad main ise banaaya gaya tha karnal gaddaphi isi jagah se apane logon ko sandesh dete the
 Gaddafi and his family were not found during this entire operation, yet no one has any idea about where he is with his entire family? After the capture of Gaddafi in the campus, the rebels opened fire and declared their victory
 libya main vidrohi gaddaphi kii vafaadaar sena par apni jeet kaa jashn manaa rahe hai
 a large number of rebels gathered at the Central Green Square in the capital Tripoli and expressed their happiness by firing bullets in the air
 vidrohi sainik or unke samarthak naare laga rahe the
 They also raised slogans in support of the US and the West
 kai saal tak main lakhanu main rahi
 Living in small towns during the 1980s and 1990s meant that you always keep the scarf wrapped and try not to get pangebangi from the killers
 main aam ladakiyon se thodi alag thi, lihaaja aise samay main jab saath padhgaye vaale mere sangi-saheliyon ne sex ko lekar experiment shuru kar die the, main dasvin kii apni pariksha ke liye shakespeare ko gaharaai se samajhane kii koshish main juty hui thi
 We did not know about 'time', pills taken the next morning of sex or other contraceptive measures
 garbhpaat ek sharmnaak cheez hua karti thi jise mere convent skool kii ladkiyaan chatkhaare lekar sunaatin, ''hai, suna tumne? pichley dinon koun doctor ke paas gai thi? '' main budhu tab tak yahi samajhati thi ki is tarah kii koi aurat dimagi ilaaji ke chakkar main gai hogi doctor ke paas
 but today! That is, even after 20 years, there is no significant change in the situation
 ladkiyaan sex ko lekar experiment karti hai lekin uske bare main charchaa karne se ve ab bhi kataraati hai
 She still refrains from stating that she is not a virgin
 ladakon ko is sab ke bare main shaayad hi koi jaankaree hoti he
 Although sex education has been implemented in a few schools, but no information is available from them
 haa, itnaa gyaan unhen hota he ki ''hameshaa condom kaa istemaal karo or sanyam se raho
 "but it is not that the information is not reaching them
 mobile par uplabdh porn or laptop ke foulder main sahej kar rakhe irotic video ne nai peedi ko yon sambandhon kaa e tu jed sikhaa diya he
 Now the difficulty arises that even if you are expert in what you have seen
 Because sex is not just an action but an emotional thing
 isaki jagah us samaaj main kahaan jo paramparaon kii jakadaaa main ghut rahaa he
 In this case, there is a small difference between the men of small cities and metros
 or auraten bhi peeche nahin
 According to the nielsen-india Today Sex Survey, men in small towns do not go on a date
 isi se pataa chalata he ki lakhanu main zyaadaatar ladke aakhir kyon chaay kii dukaanon par khadey hokar ladakiyon ko ghoorte to dikh jate hai, lekin kisi ladki ko saath chalane kii baat kehane kaa jokhim nahin uthaa pate
 In India, we do not talk about sex, but consider it a subject that should be kept to ourselves
 sex ke bare main jaankaree hamen internet yaa doston se maaloom hoti he
 Friends too, who would know what themselves? So the boys of the country grow up with little information about the need of women
 19 kii aayu par pahunchane tak chote shaharon yaa mahanagaron ke zyaadaatar ladke-ladakiyon ko 'pyaar' ho chukaa hota he or ve usee se shaadi karnaa chaahate hai
 From 20 to 25 years of age, most people get involved in similar incidents and their first physical relationship is formed on a honeymoon
 kuch muhabbat main chot khate hai or apane jivan main ai duusari ladki se byaah kar lete hai
 The men in small towns do not like to have a relationship with many colleagues
 mahilaon ko aakarshith karne kii kala bhi unhen nahin aati
 It is difficult for them to do it again and again
 isliye ve ek aasaan rasta chunate hai
 That is what his father has been doing
 ve ghar kharch ke liye paise dete hai or patni kaa kaha maanakar paariwarik shanti banaae rakhte hai
 It is a myth that men need many companions and are afraid to take responsibility
 ve katai aise nahin hote
 His only dream is that in his life a sensible girl skilled in sixteen arts should come and adopt him with all his faults
 ek sundar or budhimaan patni paane kii chahat kabhi-kabhi aurat kii samajhadaari or sahrudayata ke gun ko feekaa kar purush kii fehrist main sabase upar virajman dikhti he
 This is because only then will they make knives on the hearts of other people with a proud performance of the enlightened beauty Shalaka standing next to them
 chote shaharon ke zyaadaatar purush shaadi hone tak kunare rahete hai
 His wife is his sex partner and if he is ready for sex whole-heartedly, then he remains satisfied
 hairat kii baat he ki ek adarsh yon saathi ke rup main unke man main baithi chhavi unki patni hi hoti he, na ki kisi film star kii yaa khilaadi kii
 a trip to Kalpnalok is not a pastime of men from small towns
 aaj jab pragati or vikaas ke nae paracham laharaa rahe hai or ham khud ko udaar maan rahe hai, kitni ajeeb baat he ki chote shaharon yaa mahanagaron kaa purush ab bhi apni patni se akshat comarya kii apeksha kar rahaa he
 This is the reason that if there was a physical relationship with a close partner during college days before marriage, girls often hide it
 apni 'chhavi' ko bachaane ke liye ve kisi had tak chali jaati hai
 i remember that the good girls of the Loreto Convent had accused me of being a 'weak character and flamboyant'
 vajah itani si thi ki main apane bhai ko lene saint francis jaati jo sirf ladakon kaa skool tha or vahaan un logon se baaten karti
 Even before kissing a boy and realizing its effect, my virginity was declared a dissolution and no one was ready to marry me
 man hi man main soch rahi thi ki kitni shandaar sthiti he yah, lekin meri maa dahal gai thim
 The same facts have emerged in the survey that i knew: Sex always matters to men
 shaadi ke kuch saal baad bhi sex ahmiyat rakhata he
 By the way, even if they do not get a chance to live it, there is no shame
 chote shaharon ke mard saptaah main do se teen baar sex karte hai, jabaki mahanagaron main ek baar
 Contraception is less common in small towns, perhaps because they believe that maintaining a relationship with a single partner is the greatest protection
 chote shaharon main liv-in relationships ke liye koi jagah nahin
 Some men in metros also believe that they should get married after dating their partner instead of staying in live-in
 log aaj bhi sex ko bhaavana se alag rakhkar nahin dekhte
 So it is not easy to cohabit with many peers
 shaharon-kasbon main zyaadaatar purushon ne vivahetar sambandh se parhez kiya he
 Men from metros or cities and towns do not consider having physical relations before marriage justified
 phir, jajba kisi rishte main kitna ahm he? ham shaayad isi soch or darshan ke saath jeene ko abhishpt hai ki shaadi kaa matlab he budhaape tak kaa saath
 Actually it is an assurance related to marriage, so no further use is valid in it
 masalan, patniyon kii adla-badali, ek raat kaa sambandh, younachaar yaa phir isi tarah ke duusare khel
 Vatsyayan, the author of Kamasutra, is not proud after seeing all this
 hamaara desh chauthi sadi ke kamasutra se ludhakta hua ikkisvin sadi kii sensorship tak aa pahunchaa he
 So where 'touching' is forbidden in the code of conduct of Hindustani men, it is no sin to see private parts or intimate moments
 kai purush dusron ko kapade utaarte, nahaate yaa sahavaas karte dekhne kaa lutf uthaate hai

 The Khanduri government created history by passing the Jan Lokpal bill to fight corruption, but this historic exercise is really going to become 'history' as soon as the Nizam Congress comes to hand
 mukhyamantri vijay bahuguna is par roak lagaate hue sanshodhan kar nichali adaalaton ko isaki paridhi se baahar karne ke paksh main hai
 But the former chief minister challenges any changes in the Khanduri law
 india today se baatcheet main unhone kaha, ''kya sarkaar yah maanakar chal rahi he ki nichali adaalaton main bhrashtachar nahin ho saktaa
 We had included all such organizations from the Chief Minister to the state government which provide funds and where there is a possibility of corruption
 ''uttarakhand main bhrashtachar ke kathith aaropon ke bich pichley saal sitambar main bhaajapa alaakaman ne ramesh pokharial 'nishank' ko mukhyamantri kii kursi se hataakar khandudi ko kaman saunpi thi
 After which he supported Anna Hazare's Jan Lokpal bill from the Assembly on November 1 without any delay and took advantage of the anti-corruption wind
 rajya main lokayukta ko mahaj salaah dene vaali sanstha ke bajaae shikayaton kii jaanch, mukadmaa daayar karne or sajaa dene kii bhi shaktiyaan dekar majboot lokapal banaaya
 Just before the elections, the BJP, which was fighting for goodwill in the state, won a respectable 31 seats in the election, which is just one seat less than the Congress
 kai log maanate hai ki bhaajapa ke is sudhare pradarshan kaa ek kaaran lokapal bill bhi rahaa
 If Khanduri had not lost the election, Parthi would have returned to power
 lekin satta main ai congress ab khandudi kii is pahchaan ko hi mitaane par amada he
 Former Parliamentary Affairs Minister Prakash Pant says, "if there is any violation of this law, it would mean that the government cannot stand against corruption
" '' haalanki jab bill paarit hua, tab anna andolan kii hawa main congress ne jokhim nahin uthaaya or rajyapal ne bhi fouran sahmati dete hue ise raashtrapati ke paas bhej diya tha
 The bill is currently pending with the President and Bahuguna is trying to amend it on the basis of it
 haalanki ve sanshodhan se pehle sansad kii ore se paarit hone vaale lokayukta bill kii pratiksha karenge
 But it is believed that the Bahuguna government will keep the Chief Minister and lower courts out of its purview
 pradesh congress adhyaksh or bahuguna sarkaar main rajasav sahakaarita mantri yashpal arya kehete hai, ''jab yah bill aayaa, tab sthitiyaan alag thim
 It was brought in haste without consulting the intellectuals, the Law Commission
 '' ve kanoon main badlaav ko jaruri qaraar dete hai, ''pichhali sarkaar ne samvidhan ke anuchhed 251 kaa atikaraman kiya he
 How can it be justified that the same institution (lokayukta) be given powers of both the judiciary and the police
 ''lekin khandudi kehete hai, ''hamane samvidhan ke praavdhaanon kaa ullekh kar samajhayaa to congress ne kisi virodh ke bina bill paarit hone diya
 "he adds," There is no one above the Constitution
 hamane isamen sirf pradesh se judi sansthaaon ko shaamil kiya haisch jinhen rajya sarkaar fund detii he
 The government should tell us where we have made a mistake or why they want to change the law? "arvind Kejriwal also questions Team Anna on this campaign of Congress government," This is an unfortunate step
 yah kisi raajnneeti he ki chunaav ke vakt congress ghoshnaptr main bill ke samarthan kii baat karti he or vidhansabha main sarvasammati se bill paas karaati he, lekin satta main aate hi use khatm karne ja rahi he?''jaahir he, lokapal par rajya main siyaasi tapish badhane lagi he

 Since Parekh and prominent industrialist Kumar Mangalam Birla have come under the scanner of the CBI, there has been a round of accusations
 pi
 C
 paarekh ne kaha he ki “is faisle ko pradhanmantri ne manjuuri di thi
 
 
 The final decision is his own
 ”ek khaas maamle main sifarish karne or phir us par pradhanmantri ke faisla lene kii baat ko rekhaankit karte hue paarekh asal main jaananaa chaahate the ki sirf unhen hi kyon nishane par liya ja rahaa he? us vakt koyala mantri rahe pradhanmantri ko kyon aropamukt kar diya janaa chahie?is maamle main adaalat kii nigaraanee main jaanch hone kii vajah se vaise kisi tarah kii nirnaayak tippanee karnaa thik na hoga lekin jis tarah ke sawaal paarekh ne uthaae hai, un par to ek aam samaj vaala insaan bhi chup nahin rah saktaa
 Parekh's attitude is very important because his image has always been clean and he is known as a competent and honest officer
 ve hi the jinhone us vakt khan or khanij (vikaas or viniman) adhinium ke tahat koyala blokon ke aavanton ke maamle main pehle aao pehle paao kii gaiyr-paardarshee niti par sawaal uthaaya tha or tamaam adngon ke baavjood nijee developers ke chayan ko lekar zyada paardarshee nilaamee prakriya apnaane kii tagdi vakaalat kii thi
 Parekh's first argument is that the allegations leveled against him are baseless because the recommendation he made to the Prime Minister and on which the Prime Minister decided was based solely on merit and quality
 phir bhi un par agar sajeesh kaa aarope lagata he to kya aisa aarope pradhanmantri par nahin laganaa chahie, jinhone use manjuuri di thi? paarekh kii daleel main vajan he
 What really bothers the public is that unscrupulous politicians in corruption cases are getting a 'clean chit' immediately, while the small pawns involved are constantly being harassed
 ek mantri ke khud ke ghar par uske mantralay se sambandhit saudon kii baat to sabake jehan main taaja he
 The minister was immediately given a 'clean chit' by the investigating agency and the rest were brutally sacrificed
 do aise varisht rajaneta, jinaki saarvajanik chhavi bahut svachh to katai nahin rahi he, unhen aise samay par ‘nirdosh’ ghoshit kar diya gaya jab sattarudh party shaayad unke saath siyaasi gathbandhan ko betaab thi
 If we have the most impartial investigative agency, then such incidents spoil his reputation in the public eye
 paarekh ke maamle main uthne vaali sabase pehali chintaa yah he ki “eemaandaaree ke saath or ‘badaniyati se’ kiye jane vaale faislon main koi fark hi nahin kiya ja rahaa
 Our vigilance agencies do not have any mechanism on the basis of which they can see and record the record of government officials and protect the honest officers from the allegations against them for their decisions
 eemaandaar afasaron ke khilaaf lagaae ja rahe aaropon se nishchit rup se shashan vyavastha ko nuksaan pahonchega or or acchhee manshaa se uthaae gaye kadamon kii raah bhi mushkil ho jaaegi
 The rules and regulations of our country are very complex and it is possible for different officers to derive different meanings from them
 kisi bhi jaanch agency ko unki vyakhya par sawaal uthaakar unhen aapraadhik sajeesh se nahin jodpha chahie
 In such cases, instead of holding the officials corrupt, a professional investigation agency should pay attention to the complexities of rules and laws and offer suggestions to make them easier
 is silsile main kendriya satarkta ayog (sivisi) ko pehle die sujhaavon par abhi tak kuch hua nahin he
 The Parekh case not only drew attention to the dominating role of the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) in verifying the rulings, but also pointed to a possible reverse effect
 piemo vibhinn mantralayon ke takreeban sabhi ahm maamalon or kaamkaaj main dakhal detaa he or faislon ko prabhavit karata he
 Many times corporate houses are also under pressure behind them
 pichley saal june main maine kendriya satarkta ayog se koyala ghotaale or kuch duusare ghotaalon main piemo kii bhoomika kii jaanch karne kaa anurodh kiya tha
 i reminded them twice when there was no response, but where the effect was going to be
 piemo or mantriyon ke liye alag tathaa baakiyon ke liye alag, kisi bhi jaanch main aise dohare paimaane nahin hone chahie
 This case has raised another issue
 vah he sibiai ko swatantra rup se kaary karne kii aazaadee
 The Surpeem Court called the CBI a 'caged parrot' and advised the government to empower the agency so that it could work without any pressure from anyone
 press reporton ke mutabik, centre ne supreme court ko bataaya he ki sibiai ko sirf simit swaittata kii darkaar he
 Only he knows the reason why the government is hesitating to loosen its grip on the CBI
 sibiai ko peshewar kshamtaaon se las kiye bina hi use shashakt karne se manachaahe nattejey nahin nikalne vaale
 The ongoing investigation process on the coal scam has marginalized a big issue like coal production and has embroiled it with corruption

 raav kehete hai ki udai skim se bijli companiyon ko nishchit taur par fori raahat mili lekin ise samasya kaa sthai samaadhaan nahin mana ja saktaa
 Steps have to be taken to make DISCOM financially stronger
 raav kehete hai, "agar muft main bijli di jaaegi, chunaavon ke chalate bijli kii daren nahin badhengi, bijli kii chori rokane ke liye buniyadi dhaanche par kharchaa nahin kiya jayega to discom ke ghate phir puraani sthiti main pahunch jaaenge or udai laane kaa uddeshy khatm ho jayega
 "it is necessary to have money in the accounts of the discoms of the state to bring electricity to the needful home for improvement
" bijli vitaran companiyaan ghate se ubarkar hi buniyadi dhaanche (sab stesan, transformar) par kharch kar paaengi or bijli utpaadan companiyon ko samay se paisa dekar rajya main bijli kii killat na ho yah sunishchit kar paaengi
 In order to make the power distribution companies economically prosperous, the State Governments will have to curb the distribution of cheap and free power for political benefits
 bijli chori rokane ke liye buniyadi dhaanche ko durust karnaa hoga
 Along with this, there is a need to make government monopoly areas (coal, railways, power distribution) effective
 siiarasi ke aankadon ke mutabik, beete saat varshon (2009-10 se 2016-17 tak) main koyale ke daam 33 fisadi bad gaye, kar or duty main 207 fisadi kaa ijapha hua, vahiin koyale kii dhulaai main 54 fisadi kii badhotaree hui
 These are all areas where there is a government monopoly

 The power rate can be reduced by making these areas effective
 bijli utpaadan companiyon kaa darddesh main bijli banane vaali nijee companiyaan dohari maar se pareshaan hai
 First, arrears on the state's power distribution companies and second, the non-availability of coal as per requirement

 iske alaava koyale kii supplai kaa haal bhi bura he
 Khurana says that 75 per cent of the coal is available to private power plants
 is 75 fisadi main se bhi kuch plant par mahaj 30 fisadi kii hi supplai ho paa rahi he
 Khurana also says that there is no option to burden the consumer by increasing tariffs
 pichley saat varshon main bijli ke utpaadan kii laagat 31 fisadi se zyada bad gai he
 In such a situation, it cannot be offset by merely increasing the tariff
 iske liye sarkari ekadhikaar vaale kshetron ko prabhavi banane ke liye kadam uthaane kii jarurat he
 For example, coal production, dependence on railways to carry coal to power plants and transmission and distribution of electricity
 in kshetron main sudhaar karke bijli utpaadan kii laagat ko kaaphi kam kiya ja saktaa he
 Even after being the top coal producer, if there is a shortage of coal in the power stations of the country, then you can consider the Indian Railways responsible for it
 edalaviz kii haal main jari report ke mutabik, koyale ko power plant tak pahunchane ke liye jarurat ke mutabik railway kii rex uplabdh nahin hai or nijee bijli utpaadan companiyon ko isamen variyata nahin mil paa rahi he

 koyale kii killat bijli companiyon ko mahange aayaat ke liye majaboor karti he, jo baad main exange par bijli ke daamon main badhotaree kaa kaaran banataa he
 According to the data of July 23, there are a total of 18 power plants in the country which are facing coal shortage
 inamen saat power plant par koyale kii uplabdhta saat din se kam he
 At the same time, coal availability at 11 plants is less than four days
 batra kehete hai, "aane vaale dinon main koyale kii killat kam hoti dikhegi
 Due to early rain stoppage last year, hydro power production decreased and demand for coal suddenly increased

" udhaaharan ke taur par mumbai ke paas sthit power plant ke liye desh se koyala mangane main jitna samay lagata he, usase kam samay main australia se koyala aayaat ho jaataa he
 Importing coal is not a better option for any power plant, but for the shortage, the only option left is import

 a case of suspicious death of a female doctor in a hospital in Punjabi Bagh area of the capital Delhi has come to light

 In such a situation, the question is how Aastha Munjal might have put the entire bottle

 parivaar kaa aarope he ki kamare main jane ke liye ek or darwaja tha jisaki chaabi bhi aspataal ke paas thi to phir us daravaaje kaa istemaal kyon nahin kiya gaya
 Why was more doctors walking in the hospital on the night of the incident than everyday

 Some marks have been found on the hand of its blind faith, so how are those marks

 Narendra Modi's tsunami tasted such defeat to many parties that the phase of resignation has begun
 pehle assam ke mukhyamantri tarun gogai, phir apane bete kii haar par maharashtra ke purv mukhyamantri narayan rane or ab bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar
 All came forward, accepted the mandate and announced the resignation, taking responsibility for the defeat
 raajnneetik itihaas ko dekhen to bahut dinon ke baad aisa hua he jab chunaav nattejey manmutabik nahin hone ke kaaran naitikta ke aadhaar par itane logon ne ek baar main istife die yaa phir dene kii peshkash kii
 Now the question arises that why are not the Chief Ministers of UP and Maharashtra doing this? Despite being in power in UP, Mulayam's party performed extremely poorly
 parivaar chhod ke or koi bhi samaajawaadee loksabhaa main nahin baithegaa
 That is, Mulayam Singh Yadav is now only with his loved ones
 samarthak ye sawaal uthaa sakate hai ki yah chunaav vidhansabha kaa to tha nahin to bahumat vaali sarkaar ke mukhiya ke taur par akhilesh kyon istipha den? jawaab yah he ki mulaayam kaa sapana todane kii jimmedaari koun uthayega? aakhir mulaayam lambey arase se piem banane kaa khwab dekh rahe the
 In the name of Third Front with complete practice, the voters of UP were engaged in the work
 har raily or jansabha main apane bete kii sarkaar kii uplabdhiyaan gina rahe the, lekin upi kii janata ise nakaar kar bijepi par bharosa dikhaaya
 It is clear from this that the public is not happy with the Akhilesh government
 to naitikta ke aadhaar par hi sahi, kisi ko haar kii jimmedaari to uthaani hogi
 Beginning should be from home
 ab maharashtra kii baat karte hai
 Though the Assembly elections are to be held here within 6 months, but the congress-ncp alliance got a view of the coming times in these elections

 is kharaab pradarshan kii jimmedaari koun legaa? narayan rane ko dekhie, betaa nitesh rane chunaav haara to unhone mantri pad se istife kii peshkash kar di
 Opponents may find it a political stunt, but they come out in the name of morality
 aise main soobe ke mukhyamantri prithviraj chavaan kaa koi ferj nahin banataa
 Now even the party high command is seen bowing to the mandate
 congress kii adhyaksh sonia gandhi or upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi pehle hi haar kii jimmedaari le chuke hai, lekin ab donon congress kaarysmiti se istipha de sakate hai

 pradhanmantri narendra modi apane do divasiy daure ke liye shuukravaar subah nepal pahunche
 Here he worshiped at Janaki temple in Janakpur
 iske alaava PM modi ne nepali piem ke
 P
 oli ke saath janakapur-ayodhya bas sarvice ko hari jhandi dikhaai
 This bus service is being seen as an extension of the Ramayana circuit
 aapako bataa den ki ayodhya se janakapur ke bich kareeb 493 kimi
 Is a distance of
 modi bole- yahaan puja karne vaala main pehla pmisa bas seva ke shuru hone se badi sankhya main shraddhaluon ko aane jane main suvidha hogi
 Apart from this, people will be able to take a direct bus to reach Ayodhya from Delhi to Janakpur in Nepal
 madhesi ilaakon se bharat kii awajahi main logon ko aasaani hogi
 After worshiping in Janaki temple, the Prime Minister said that i am proud to have the privilege of coming here to worship Mother Sita
 main bharat kaa pehla pradhanmantri hum jisane janakapur main aakar puja kii
 i want to thank the Prime Minister of Nepal
 unhone kaha ki puri duniya main tourism tej gati se aage bad rahaa he
 Together we are taking forward the plan of Ramayana Circuit
 unhone kaha ki mere liye khushi kii baat he ki jis upi ke banaras ne mujhe pradhanmantri banaaya or usee upi ke ayodhya se janakapur kii bas sarvice shuru ho rahi he
 Why is Janakpur special? Janaki temple in the center of Janakpur, Nepal is dedicated to Goddess Sita
 is mandir ko janakapurdham bhi kaha jaataa he
 People who believe in Hinduism are stunned by the huge complex of this temple
 madhya pradesh ke tikamgarh kii rani ne is mandir ko 1911 main banwaaya tha
 It took almost 16 years to build
 mandir ke vishaal parisar ke aasapaas kul milakar 115 sarovar hai
 Apart from this, there are many kunds, among which Gangasagar, Parashuram Kund and dhanush-sagar are more famous
 gauratlab he ki ramayana circuit pradhanmantri narendra modi ke dream project main se ek he jisamen janakapur ek mahatvapurn padaav he
 The Union Government has proposed a budget of 245 crores for the first phase of the Ramayana Circuit Scheme
 iske alaava chitrakoot or shringverpur ke bich ke 11 sthalon ke liye bhi alag bajet prastaavit he
 These important religious places will be developed from the point of view of tourism, from where Lord Rama went to Sri Lanka during exile
 uniwarsity ke hostel main rahane vaale chaatro kii tarah modi sarkaar ke kai mantri 'namo hudi' pahane nazar aane lage hai
 Shahrukh Khan also wears this type of hoodie to look young and energetic in his 50s
 is hudi aagaman ke pehle bhi media ne kuch mantriyon kii chhavi urjavan or kaamkaaji ke rup main gadhane kaa kaam kiya he
 One of them is Railway Minister Piyush Goyal
 piyush goyal ke twitor handle par jaaenge to aapako pataa chalegaa ki mantri ji har subah kisi na kisi mahapurush kii jayanti yaa punyatithi par koi twit karte hai, unka samaran karte hai or apni prerana bataate hai
 But even after getting the inspiration of so many great men, they cannot save the laborers working on contract in their ministry schemes from exploitation
 media main gadhi gai chhavi ke barakes agar aap theke par kaam karne vaale mazaduron par ai sieji kii report ko dekhenge ki to pataa chalegaa ki railway bagair kisi mantri ke chal rahaa he
 It would not be right to say Ram Bharosa because Ram Bharosa runs the whole country
 mantri ji ko agar sieji kii report se etraz ho to ve is report ko lekar jaaen or das bees hazaar theke ke mazaduron ke bich padhein
 Milk milk will become water water
 sieji ne 2014-15 se lekar 2016-17 ke bich die gaye 463 kantrect main kaam karne vaale theke ke mazaduron ke halaat kii samiksha kii he
 After reading this audit it seems that nothing has changed in Railways since 2014
 thekedaaron kii mouj ab bhi jari he
 In 2016-17, the Railways paid 35098 crore for contract work
 sieji kaa kahana he ki thekedaaron ne iskaa 4 pratishat hissaa yani 1400 karod se adhik kii raashi mazaduron ke hisse se maar liya
 Not only this, the Ministry of Railways gives contracts worth several thousand crores
 un kaamon main theke par rakhe gaye mazaduron ko shoshan se bachaane ke liye sansad ne jitne bhi kanoon banaae hai, unamem se kisi kaa bhi 50 percent bhi paalan nahin hota he
 Neither they get minimum wages, nor overtime, nor leave, nor leave money, nor their provident fund is deducted nor their provident fund is registered in the employees' organization
 sieji kii report bataati he ki niyam ke mutabik railway kii taraf se koi bhi adhikari yaa pratinidhi in thekon kii jaanch karne ke liye nahin jaataa he
 Not only Railways, Ministry of Labor, Provident Fund Organization also does not go for any investigation
 thekedaaron ko luutane kii khuli chhot mili hoti he
 Contracts are awarded without license
 sieji ne paaya ki maatr 140 thekedaaron ne apana panjikaran central lebar kamishnar ke daftar main karaayaa he
 Out of that only 12 contractors have done their annual accounts
 jabaki sabhi sabhi kantrector ke liye hisaab dena anivaary hota he
 Railways should have records of all their contractors
 sieji ne jab maanga to maatr 30 thekedaaron ke ricard milen
 Think, what will be the scale of the loot amount when the contractors are working without calculation in the project of thirty forty thousand crores in Indian Railways? Hundreds of contractors did not give records to the CAG
 sieji dekhnaa chaahati thi ki kitne mazaduron ko check yaa bank se bhugtan ho rahaa he
 The rule is that payment will be by bank or check
 212 kantrect main to ricard hi nahin mila ki paisa kaise diya gaya
 Salary slip was found in only 18 contracts
 169 kantrect main bhugtan nagad kiya gaya jabaki yah sarkaar nagad bhugtan ke khilaaf bataai jaati he
 It is considered a means of corruption but the Railway Minister could not ensure the cash payment in the contract of his own ministry
 zaahir he railway main thekedaar jamkar lut rahe hai
 There is a law to get minimum wages, but out of 463 contracts, only 105 have been given minimum wages
 bahuton ne to ricard hi nahin die
 While fixing the cost of any project, the cost is fixed according to the minimum wage
 agar wo paisa thekedaar maar len to kitne sau karod kaa hisaab unki jeb main you hin chalaa jaataa hoga
 With public money, the government gave the contractors that you give all the money, but the contractors did not give the entire money to the workers
 donon taraf se janata kaa hi paisa lutaa gaya
 Only 120 contracts were discharged and paid for leave
 baaki main nahin
 The CAG has written that 5 out of 2745 workers
 46 karod rupee thekedaaron ne maar liye
 49 contracts received neither leave nor leave money
 9 ghante se zyada yaa saptaah main 48 ghante se zyada kaam karaane par over time dena hota he
 In 30 contracts it was found that over time was not given and 1
 74 karod rupee maar liye gaye
 The CAG report states that nothing much has changed within the Railway Ministry
 thekedaaron kii mouj abhi bhi jari he
 If the Railway Minister had worked, if all these things had been corrected, then lakhs of railway workers would have been happy
 vaah-wahi kar rahe hote
 They are not exploited and the railway minister does not have to campaign all day on Twitter
 gujarat ke ahmedabad shahar main ek yuvak ne pehle apni premika ke saath balaatkaar kiya or phir bachane ke liye premika ko hi nashile padaarthon kii taskari ke aarope main fansaane kii sajeesh rach daali

 jaankaree ke aadhaar par narkotics beuro kii team ne mahila ke ghar par chapa maaraa or maukey se 600 gram charas baraamad kar lee
 The cost of which is being told to be three lakh rupees
 narkotics beuro kii team ne jab mahila se poochtacha ki sara maamla saaf ho gaya
 Actually, the woman had a love affair with a man named Dinesh Prajapati aka Raj Kothari
 isi dauraan dinesh ne ek din mahila ko apni havas kaa shikaar bana liya
 The woman lodged a complaint against Dinesh at the police station
 isi baat se naaraaz hokar dinesh ne peedit mahila ke khilaaf sajeesh rachi
 He first kept the charas at the woman's house and then reported the narcotics bureau itself to have charas in his house to trap him in drugs
 lekin mahila se poochtacha main maamla khul gaya or aaropee dinesh apane bune jaal main hi funs gaya
 Later, the NCB team raided and arrested the accused Dinesh
 ab beuro kii team dinesh se yah jaanane kii koshish kar rahi he ki itani maatra main vah charas kahaan se laayaa tha
 The Aam Aadmi Party, surrounded by allegations of spending public funds to fight its own personal case, came out to clarify the entire matter
 bijepi dwaara lagaae gaye tamaam aaropon par aam aadmi party ke varisht netaa or dilli ke upmukhyamantri manish sisodiya ne kaha, "yah masalaa cricket ke bhrashtachar se judaa hua he
 BJP is adopting such methods to divert attention from EVM scam
 sarkaar ne is puure maamle par jaanch bithai thi jisamen kai bade log funs rahe the
 Who later sued
 chunki jaanch sarkaar ne bithai thi isliye mukhyamantri ke khilaaf mukademe kaa bill sarkaar degi kyonki yah arvind kejariwal kaa koi nijee mukadmaa nahin tha"
 Manish Sisodia said that it was the government's responsibility to stop corruption in cricket
 sarkaar ne kadam uthaae
 Now why would Arvind Kejriwal personally pay the fees of the lawyer engaged in the investigation being done in cricket by the government? That was not his personal case
 us mukademe ko to ab sarkaar ladegi
 Attempts to divert public attention from EVM scam: Aam Aadmi Party has called the allegations of Janata fund misuse as an attempt to divert attention from EVM scam
 manish sisodiya ne in aaropon ke samay par sawaal uthaate hue kaha ki isaki timming dekhi jaae
