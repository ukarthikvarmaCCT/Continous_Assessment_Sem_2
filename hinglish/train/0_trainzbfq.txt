 The crime of gang rape itself is so disgusting and sarcastic that the mind becomes bitter on hearing it
 lekin agar kahin, kisi ke 45 se bhi zyaada gangrape karne kii baat sunne ko mili, to takaleef kitni or kisi hoti he, ye bayaan karnaa bhi mushkil he
 Such is the fact that it came out of the fort of Kajaligarh near Indore
 yahaan police ke haath luteron ke ek aise gang tak pahunche hai, jinhone teen saalon main kareeb 45 se bhi zyaada ladakiyon se gangrape kiya
 Can't believe hearing, eyes are deceived by seeing
 magar kya karen? yahi sach he
 That truth, which has come out of this famous Kajaligarh Fort in Indore
 saamne aayaa he ki kis tarah is qile main saalon-saal sailaani aate rahe or gangrape kaa shikaar ho kar khamoshi se waapas lautate rahe
 It has come to light that how the robbers of humanity hidden between the walls of the fort kept the tourists hunting for years and looted the valuables as well as the girls' possessions
 or saamne aayaa he ki asmat kii lut ke saath-saath kajaligarh ke ye gunahagaar kis tarah gangrape kii shikaar ladakiyon kaa ms banaate rahe or inhen ms ke zarie unhen blackmel karte rahe
 In this way, this black story of Kajaligarh would never have come in front of the world, if the police would not have seen these looters
 lekin indore kii cimrrol police lutpaat kii ek shikaayat kii tafteesh karti hui in badmaashon tak kya pahunchi, ek kaufanaak or dahalane vaali kahani saamne aa gai
 a story that even the policemen themselves found difficult to believe
 in badmaashon ne lutpaat kii baat to kubul kii hi, lekin saath hi kubul kiya ki wo pichley kuch saalon main kajaligarh ke qile main lutpaat ke saath-saath vahaan ghoomane aanevaali takreeban 45 se bhi zyada ladakiyon se gangrape bhi kar chuke hai
 This was not a minor confession
 lihaaza, lut ke ditection se raahat kii saans le rahi police ye sun kar khud hi sakate main aa gai
 The policemen also lost their senses from Dhaka
 khandhiron ke peeche chhipakar dete the vaardaat ko anjaamlekin kehete hai naa, ki police kii giraft main aane ke baad achche-achche badmaashon ke bhi hosh ud jate hai
 So this time the senses of these crooks flew in such a way that they started telling the story of their misdeeds like a parrot
 or ye karatuut thi, 45 se zyaada ladakiyon se gangrape kii
 Actually, this gang had been hiding behind the desolate plaintiffs and fort ruins of Kajaligarh for years of looting and gang-rape, but in most cases, the girls who are victims of gang rape, their friends or relatives are afraid of the local police Did not reach to write the report
 ab lut ke saath-saath serial gangrape kaa ye maamla saamne aa jane ke baad khud police ko hi ye samaj main nahin aa rahaa he ki akhir wo is maamle kii tafteesh ab aage badaye, to kaise badaye
 They used to take clothes off and leave them in the forest, they used to gangrap first
 or phir ms bana lete
 And when this does not fill the mind, then take the clothes off of the girls and leave them to wander in the forest
 kehane kaa matlab ye ki gangrape kaa ye khoff or sadma itani dur tak ladakiyon kaa peechha karata
 That no one ever dared to go to the police
 or bas, isi tareeke kaa phayda uthaa kar wo saalon-saal ladakiyon kii asmat se khelte rahe
 And the gang-raped girls continued to bear everything quietly
 4 badmaashon ke is gang ke giraft main aane ke baad jab iske sargana shriram ne munh kholaa, to police bas sunati hi rah gai
 He said that he not only used to loot the tourists visiting Kajaligarh alone, but also gang raping with girls was his favorite pastime
 lekin gangrape kii vaardaat ko anjaam dene kaa inkaa tareeqa yani inaki modes oprendi bilkul hat kar thi
 Something that the girls themselves could not muster the courage to walk on their feet to reach the police after being victimized
 aise karte the ye ghinauna kaam--ye badmaash aksar unheen ladakiyon ko apana shikaar banaate the, jo apane pati yaa bwoyfrand ke saath yahaan pahunchati thim or sunsaan jagahon par ghoomane nikal jaati thim
 After getting both alone, the crooks at the point of arms used to threaten them, beat and looted them and then beat the boy and used to torture the girl in front of him
 --isamen bhi khaas baat ye thi ki gangrape ke saath-saath wo in jodon kii aapattijanak haalat main ms bhi bana liya karte the or saath hi ye dhamkee bhi dete the ki agar unhone police ke paas jane kii galati kii, to wo ye mmes puri duniya main failaa kar unhen badnaam kar denge
 In many cases, the gang miscreants did not even return their clothes after being tortured with the girls, and after the miscreants left, such girls demanded clothes from the villagers living nearby
 --itnaa hi nahin gangrape or lutpaat ke saath hi wo apni pakad main aae jode ke mobile phone se unka sim card nikaal kar bhi unke saamne hi tod dete, taaki unke changul se chhootane ke baad wo foran madad ke liye kisi se baat bhi naa kar saken
 - And the deserted ruins of Kajaligarh Fort and the dense forests here would prove to be a hiding place for these miscreants
 police kii mushkil, tafteesh kaise aage badhehaalanki ab itnaa sabakuch hone ke baavjood police ko ye samaj main nahin aa rahaa he ki aakhir wo serial gangrape kii is kufnaak kahani kii tafteesh aage badaye to kaise badaye, kyonki badmaashon kaa kubulanamaa apni jagah he
 But the reality is that till now in these cases the police do not have even one such complaint, which they can connect with this act of this gang
 ab aise main serial gangrape ke in gunahagaaron ko sazaa dilaa paanaa police ke saamne apane-aap main ek badi chunauti he
 45 in pursuing this case of gangrape
 beshak indore police ke haath-paanv phool rahe hon, lekin indore ke log jaanate hai ki kajaligarh kaa kila
 How bad has it been for such an incident
 ab police beshak kajaligarh se gangrape kii ek bhi shikaayat saamne naa aane kii baat kah rahi ho, lekin logon kii jubaan se lekar blog tak main kajaligarh qile ke saath ye badanaami chaspaan he
 It was a bad thing whether this fort of Kajaligarh became a witness to a particular war or not, during the reign of Killaholkar kings
 lekin kile kii darakati daro-diwaar or chaaron ore hare-bhare vaadiyon se ghira ye khandhar aaj bhi sailaaniyon ko chumbak kii tarah apni ore khinchataa he
 Lord Shankar's temple built along the fort and the nearby flowing waterfall adds beauty to its beauty
 lekin ye kudarti khubsuurati or bhagwaan ke mandir kii maujuudagi ke baavjood serial gangrape ke ye gunahagaar apni gunahon se baaj nahin aae
 Now the police of Indore are preparing to give walkover to these miscreants due to no specific complaint in this case, but the world knows that such crimes have been happening around Kajaligarh not for today, but for years
 
 or to or kai blogs or yahaan tak ki articals main bhi agar kajaligarh kii khubsuurati kaa bakhaan he, to yahaan ke nakaaratmak pahaluon ke taur par yahaan honevaale aise gunahon kaa bhi zikr he

 The PM and the President could not get the eye of the administration to hide the stairs of the broken ghats by hoarding mats and welts

 Cultural programs were being held at these ghats to welcome them, but the people of Benaras were also looking at how the reality was hidden which started from the broken staircase of Tulsi Ghat next to Assi Ghat, later Prabhu Ghat, There are about half a dozen ghats, including Lalitha Ghat, in the form of staircases and platforms
 prashasan ne badi khubi se ganga main gir rahe naalon ko bhi dhank diya tha
 Awadhesh Dixit says that "prime Minister Narendra Modi ji don't look through the eyes of others, if you want to see the real picture, then remove the cover yourself

 Resident of Kashi, Awadhesh Dixit says, "we noticed that the picture of the Ghats is being changed to show the wrong picture
 jo vaastavik chitra he use chipaaya ja rahaa he
 The stairs are closed
 unke upar usee rang kaa carpet bicha diya gaya he jis rang ke pathar hone chahie
 This means that, as you see, what is the problem in maintaining those things
 '' Prime Minister Narendra Modi and French President passed through about 40 ghats from Assi Ghat to Rajendra Prasad Ghat
 in ghaaton par unke swaagat ke liye saanskrithik kaarykram to ho rahe the lekin banaras ke log is baat ko bhi dekh rahe the ki kaise hakeekat ko chipaaya gaya he jo assi ghat ke bagal main tulsi ghat kii tuuti seedhiyaan se shuru hokar baad ke prabhu ghat, lalita ghat sahit takreeban aadha darjan ghaaton tak darakati sidhiyon or chabutaron ke rup main he

 Stairs are broken, drains are falling where drains are falling, boards have been installed

 '' Comments dashakon se ganga kii dasha bhi thik nahin
 There was a lot of dirt in the drain because of the excess of water in it

 But still the dirt on the shore was bad

 The District Magistrate Yogeshwar Ram Mishra is clearly refusing to sprinkle the stains but is giving his cleaning on the broken stairs like this - "there is a huge action plan for the contaminated water getting in the Ghats and Ganga

 Tuesday's day can be overwhelming for the people of Delhi
 baari is myne main ki rajdhani ke kai ilaakon main pani kii kami ho sakati he
 The reason is that two water treatment plants that supply water to them in Delhi have been partially closed due to which there is a possibility of water supply being disrupted in many areas
 sarkaar banaate hi arvind kejariwal ke liye bhi ye ek bada jhatka he
 First the charismatic victory of the Aam Aadmi Party in the Delhi Assembly elections, followed by the swearing in of Ramlila Maidan and then the historic announcement of giving 666 liters of free water every day for 3 months in front of Delhiites
 hameshaa se pani ko tarasati rajdhani kii janata ko laga ki bas ab to jeevandaayini jal se unki jindagi labalab ho jaaegi
 But there is bad news for Delhi's public as 2 of the water treatment plants supplying water to Delhi, Wazirabad Water Treatment Plant and Chandrawal Water Treatment Plant have been closed partially due to water pollution
 dilli jal board ke is faisle ke baad dilli ke kai ilaakon main pani kii baari killat ho sakati he
 Especially in East Delhi, North East Delhi, Old Delhi and New Delhi, people can get worried for water
 ye wo ilaake hai jahaan wazirabad plant se pani ko saaf karke gharon tak supplai kii jaati he
 This decision of the Delhi Jal Board has created a rage in the people living in the affected areas of Delhi
 haalanki pani kii supplai par asar padane ke peeche nai naveli kejariwal sarkaar kii koi hissedari nahin he kyonki faisla kuch or vajahon se liya gaya he
 It is worth noting that the Wazirabad water treatment plant has a capacity of 120 million gallons per day, while the Chandrawal water treatment plant has a capacity of 90 million gallons per day
 in donon water treetment plant main pani kii supplai wazirabad bairaj se hoti he, lekin wazirabad bairaj main hi icttha hone vaale yamuna ke pani main pradooshan kii vajah se ammonia kii maatra saamaanya str se zyada bad gai he
 For this reason, partial closure has been decided because the amount of ammonia in the water can prove to be harmful to health
 wazirabad water treetment plant ke aanshik rup se band hone se uttar purvi dilli ke yamuna vihaar, bhajanpura, shahdara, dilashaad garden, silampur, gita colony jaise ilaako main pani kii supplai main kami aane kii ashanka he
 While the capacity of Chandrawal water treatment plant may be affected, supply to Chandni Chowk, Civil Line, Dariya Ganj, New Delhi area and surrounding areas may be disrupted
 pani kii is sambhavit killat ke peeche kii vajah aisi he ki kuch alag karne kaa daawa karne vaale dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal bhi kuch nahin kar sakate hai
 Now it is expected that the level of ammonia in Delhi's living Yamuna should be reduced as soon as possible so that people in the affected areas can be provided clean clean drinking water

 All the records of the World Cup were deposited in the account of Australia, so there was a lot of excitement in their camp but in this World Cup, the strong form of New Zealand, the process of not losing a single match and the feat of beating Australia in the league round, also presented them as a strong opponent
 was doing
 ranon se bhari melbern kii pich par toss ahm tha
 Luck came to New Zealand and Brandon mccallum quickly picked up the batting
 apane van-de kariyar kaa aakhri match khel rahe clark bhi chaahate to ballebaaji karnaa hi the lekin toss haare the isliye unhen gendbaazi main hi pehledam dikhaanaa tha
 Both the teams expressed their confidence in the 11 players who performed brilliantly in the pressure match of the semi-finals and went into the final battle of the title without any change in the team
 newjiland ke openar brandan maikkalam or martin gaptil apane kariyar kii sabase badi pari khilne maidan main utre
 Live commentary of the final match gave New Zealand a great start to the tournament with Jhatakamakkalam and Guptill giving a great start to New Zealand
 ek baar phir se unhen yahi karnaa tha lekin final kaa dabaav is jodi par baari padgaya
 Captain mccallum made a mistake in the very first over of the innings that he will probably not forget for a lifetime
 michel stark ke over kii paanchavi gend ekadam sidhithi, maikkalam ko use sidhe balle se khelnaa tha lekin isse pehle ki unka balla neeche aata gend of stump lekar ud chuki thi
 Every spectator on the field stood by their seats, cheering for Stark, and Brandon mccallum was quietly returning to the pavilion without scoring any runs
 newjiland ne 1 ran par 1wicket kho diya tha
 When Kane Williamson came to the crease, he had a big responsibility
 martin gaptil ke saath milakar unhone dhire-dhire newjiland kii pari ko agebadane kaa silsilaa shuru kiya
 Australian Pace Battery of Stark, Hazelwood and Johnson wreaked havoc
 jitani gendon par ran ban rahe the usase zyada gendonpar newjiland ke ballebaaj beet ho rahe the
 Williamson and Guptill batted extremely slowly for the next 10 overs
 is dauraan newjiland kaa ausat sirf 3 ran pratiover tha
 Clarke made a sudden change in bowling in the 12th over and gave the ball to Glenn Maxwell
 maxwell ne apni duusari hi gend par wo kar dikhaaya jisakikisi ne kalpana bhi nahin kii thi
 Guptill fell slightly behind to punch a short off length offbreak ball but the ball did not spin as expected
 jab tak gaptil kaa balla gend tak pahunchataa, gend unke of stump kii gilliyaan bikher chuki thi
 New Zealand's biggest star Martin Guptill farewell in this tournament by scoring just 15 runs from 34 balls

 New Zealand score 2 wickets for 33 runs in 2 overs

 In an attempt to push Johnson's length ball straight, he caught Johnson
 williamsan ne 33 gendonpar 12 ran banaae
 The innings also did not complete 50 runs and three key New Zealand batsmen had returned to the pavilion
 iliyat-tailor ne sanbhali parisemifinal match main dakshin africa ke khilaaf match jitau pari khilne vaale grant iliyat or star ballebaaj ross tailor par ab sari zimmedaari aa padi
 Both were under pressure to save Nasriff wickets but also had to bring their team to a score from which New Zealand could think of winning this match
 donon nemilakar pehle to pari ko jamaaya or phir teji se ran banane bhi shuru kar die
 Although New Zealand could get another blow in the 20th over, the review saved them
 maxwell kii gend par ampire dharmasena ne iliyat ko elbeadblyoo qaraar diya lekin tailor ke kehane par iliyat ne iske khilaaf rivyuu le liya
 The replays were clear that the ball was going out of the leg stump
 ampire ko faisla badalanaa padaa
 Elliott and Taylor then played at an average of around 5 to take New Zealand to the 100 mark in the 27th over
 iske baad jamkar ballebaaji kar rahe iliyat ne 51 gendon par 3 chaukon or ek chakke kii badaulat apni half centuri bhi puri kar lee
 The partnership that New Zealand needed was frozen

 New Zealand's score had reached 150 by the 35th over

 On the very first ball of the 36th over, Faulkner trapped Taylor

 Hedin caught a great catch, diving with one hand
 ampire ko is faisle ke liye tivi riple kaasahaara lenaa padaa
 Second semi-final hero Corey Anderson was now at the crease
 ek baar phir har koi unki or iliyat kii ek behtareen saajhedaari kii ummid kar rahaa thalekin foconor ne ek gend baad hi sari ummiden tod kar rakh deen
 Anderson's slow reaction to Faulkner's full length ball drowned him
 gend unke pad se lagati huistamps main samaa gai
 Anderson could not even open the account
 agle over main michel stark ne newjiland ke wicketiper ballebaaz luk ronki kaa shikaar kiya
 Clarke captained the stalwart and kept slip for Stark, whose reward was in the form of Ronkey's catch
 stark kii gend par ronki ne balla adaaya or gend balle kaabahar kinaaraa leti hui sidhe clark ke paas pahunch gai
 Ronkey became the third New Zealand batsman to not open an account in the final match
 35 se 40 over ke bichpavaraple main newjiland ne sirf 15 ran banaae or 3 wicket ganvaae
 The Kiwi team was on the backfoot after losing 6 wickets at 151

 Johnson's tremendous yorker in the 41st over was not answered by Daniel Vettori

 Vettori scored 9 runs off 21 balls in the last innings of his one-day career
 agle over main jamkar khel rahegrant iliyat bhi galati kar gaye
 He was quick to play by blowing Faulkner's slow ball on the leg side and the ball went to the wicketkeeperhead with the edge of his bat
 iliyat ne 82 gendon par 83 ran kii shandaar pari kheli jisamen 7 chauke or 1 chakka shaamil the
 The 200 bowlers of Muhalnew Zealand were now batting and the runs had become very difficult not only
 45wein over main mat henry bina khaataa khole johnson kaa shikarbon gaye, unhen cover point par stark ne lapka
 For New Zealand, the score of 200 now seems far-fetched
 johnson ke isi over kii aakhri gend ko bolt neshortleg par khelaa, jahaan khadey maxwell ne furti dikhaate hue use non striker and par sidhe wicket main de maaraa
 Tim Southee was unable to return to the crease before the ball and with this, New Zealand's innings ended on 183 runs

 The target given to him in the match, such as the World Cup final on Australian soil, was a very modest target which New Zealand bowlers would need to unite on the ground to save

 The way the party gave the Lok Sabha ticket to Assembly Speaker Mata Prasad Pandey and four ministers of the state government, it seems clear that it is not easy for the SP to find a winning candidate
 vahiin party ne vartmaan saansad aar ke patel, kamalesh valmiki or radhe mohan singh kaa tikat kaat kar sanket diya he ki vafadari or jitau pratyaashee uski pehali praathamikta he
 On one hand, the tickets of these people were cut, while Chandrapal Singh from Jhansi and Vishwambhar Prasad Nishad from Hamirpur were given the Lok Sabha ticket, while both these leaders have been defeated in the recent assembly elections

 Virat has also openly expressed his opinion about his game
 padhein yah puri baatcheet
 
 
 
 aapane apane pichley kai maichon ke dauraan jaadui pari kheli he or maine ise cover bhi kiya he
 i have been covering you ever since you played for the Under-19s
 kya aap bataaenge ki aap lagaataar itnaa acha kaise khel lete hai or yah aapke liye kaise sambhav ho paaya he?freshnes ke saath khelnaa bahut hi jaruri hota he
 As soon as you get upset, your performance level will fall
 aapke paas pich ke bare main sochane kaa mauka nahin rahata he
 Actually i have learned how to keep a good mood
 rojaanaa khilne ke dauraan main apni hartbeet check karata hum
 If it is not beating loudly, then i understand that i am in a good space and can take the right decision
 yahi tarika he meraa apni inings shuru karne kaa
 After the innings are over, i return to my mode again
 yahi kaaran he ki meri pichhali sari inings ek hi tareeke se shuru hoti hai
 You said that you do all this in a very simple way
 yah kaaphi acha he
 Before doing this interview, i had asked Sachin Tendulkar what do you think of Virat Kohli? His answer to this was that he can do all this easily
 lekin main poochna chahta hum ki gujarat ke khilaaf aapane shatak lagaaya
 Again scored 100 against this team
 jahaan tak mujhe yaad he ki aap cover main fielding bhi kar rahe the
 Does your life depend on all these things? How can someone be so passionate and committed? The most important thing is to give a respect to the game
 har ek gend jo main kheltaa hum, us par apana 120 percent detaa hum
 Even in the Test match, if the 88th over is going on, i still want to give my best
 mujhe vah samay acchhee tarah yaad he jab main kaaphi yang tha or international cricket main aane kii koshish main laga hua tha
 You should never forget where you came from
 yah cheez mere dimag main hameshaa kahin na kahin bani rahati he
 Maybe this is the reason for my good performance
 jab tak main feet or fine hum, main yah sari chijen karata rahoonga
 You mentioned your straggle so I'll take you back a bit
 2011 / 12 melbern, sidney 2011 / 12 or uske baad perth or phir wo 75 ran, iske baad edilade jahaan aapane 116 ran banaae
 Can you tell me what the difference was between Sydney and Perth? According to me, he was born Virat Kohli of cricket
 vah star jise ham aaj dekhte hai or jiske bare main baaten karte hai, vah sidney or melbern kii apeksha ab kahin behatar ho gaya he?wo kaaphi baichaiyn kar dene vaale din the kyonki main westeindies ke khilaaf acha nahin khel paaya tha
 At that time i also had some problems in my back and she was taking time to recover
 main us samay england daure par bhi nahin ja paaya kyonki main acha nahin khel rahaa tha
 After this, i started getting opportunities again
 main apane test kariyar ko phir se trek par laane kii koshish kar rahaa tha
 i was then sent on a tour of Australia
 melbern main kuch khaas nahin ho paaya
 Sydney too did not do well
 mujhe khud par vishwaas hi nahin ho paa rahaa tha
 But now when i look back, i find that what will happen will happen
 kuch chijen tabhi aapke paas aati hai jab aap use shiddat se chaahate hai
 i don't know what happened to me after Sydney
 bas main apane aapako yahi kahata tha ki mere naam 8 vanade shatak hai or main is level main khel saktaa hum
 Actually, when you think that there is some power that will help you and show you the way, and when that opportunity comes, you have to catch it
 viraat kohli or ran chess karne kaa kya rishta he?dekhie, main aapako phir kahuunga ki maine apane khel main zyada se zyada vishwaas karnaa shuru kar diya he
 When you get into international cricket, you still keep searching for your land
 us samay bhi aap apane game ko samajhane kii koshish main lage rahete hai
 You are part of a team made up of eleven people
 mujhe jeet se sabase zyada khushi milti he or mere andar isaki sabase zyada bhukh he
 i know so much about chasing runs that i have a target in front of me
 If we meet them, i will win and i am waiting for the same moment that i want to achieve with my teammates
 kya aap bataaenge ki aap pressure main kaise manage karte hai
 When you played a brilliant innings against Australia in a T20 match and the whole country was saying only Virat, Virat and only Virat
 itane dabaavon ko ek saath kaise deal karte hai?agar eemaandaaree se bataaun to main bachapan se hi everej nahin hona chahta tha
 Even the club wanted to make the highest number at the time of cricket
 us samay bhi log mujhe erogent kehete the
 The way i used to say my things to the coach, she also used to talk to the people
 lekin mujhe khushi he ki iske baavjood main nahin badla
 The most important thing is to understand yourself
 aisa kuch bhi nahin he jo paaya na ja saktaa he
 Maybe this quality has come naturally in me, but i am ready to think positive
 phir chaahe mujh par kitna bhi zyada pressure hi kyon na ho
 This is really good enough
 aapane erogent shabd yuj kiya
 i remember when you scored 183 runs during a match in Dhaka
 us samay aapane apane prashansakon ko autograph die, press conference main hissaa liya
 At that time i also felt that this boy could not be an aerogant
 aapke bare main sabhi baaten karte hai
 Saurabh often mentions that you have filled a passion in the Indian team
 
 
 haa,captaini kaa gunmujhamen kudarti aayaa he
 i may not have been able to prove myself in the beginning
 pehle main alag-alag khilaadiyon ko handle nahin kar sakaa lekin ab puri unit ek hi disha main chal rahi he
 Whether it is fitness culture or nutrition
 har batsman desh ko jitaane ke liye kabhi bhi khilne ko taiyaar rahata he
 You must have seen that Ajinkya Rahane scored two centuries in the Delhi Test match
 vah milastone ke bare main nahin soch rahaa tha balki team kya chaahati he, is par dhyaan de rahaa tha
 These things are coming in that
 meraa matlab yah he ki ham sab yah fact jaanate hai ki hamen kisi bhi tarah se jitkar aana he
 Whoever will be ahead in this process, the entire team will enjoy its performance
 aisa isliye hota he ki ham sabhi jaanate hai ki ham apana 120 percent denge
 As a captain, you cannot want anything more than this
 jab tak team pishan or kamitment ke saath match khelegi, tab tak aap jitate rahenge
 You talked about fitness culture
 kya aap is bare main vistaar se bataa sakate hai? aap kai tareekon se indian main ke simbel ban chuke hai
 Can you tell me how you keep your body? The last few months have been quite a change for me
 jo training pehle main kar rahaa tha, use maine phir shuru kar diya he
 i learned it last year in the Sri Lanka Test Series tour
 isliye is baat kaa sara credit hamaare trainer shankar basu ko jaataa he
 He is also with me in RCB
 vah aise aadmi hai jinhen sports fitness ke bare main choti se choti baat bhi pataa he
 He knows very well what a fast bowler needs, what a spinner needs, what a wicket-keeper needs and what a batsman needs? They are well aware of everything
 wo mujhe itnaa aage le gaye hai, jahaan tak jane ke bare main main soch bhi nahin saktaa
 There was a time when i could not lift a certain weight in dead lifts but now i do it
 unhone mujhe dhairya rakhana sikhaaya
 This thing changed me a lot
 ab main thakaan main bhi khud main energy mahasoos karata hum
 This is all due to diet and training
 meraa aglaa sawaal yah he ki kya aapako is tip kii training 40-45 degree kii garmi main khilne main madad karegaa
 In such a situation, when we stand outside even for only 30 minutes, then trouble starts
 khaskar aap jaise logon ke liye jo itani zyada garmi main 100 kaa score banaate hai
 Take Gujarat, where you have done 6,6,4,6,6
 darasal ham main se kisi ne bhi itane achche score kii ummid nahin kii thi
 Not even me
 kahaan se itani takat aati he aapmen?eemaandaaree se kahuun to yah sab aapaki taiyaari par nirbhar karata he
 This is the way to play a game like cricket
 mere liye motiveshan yah he ki main kitni jaldi 0 se 100 par pahunch saktaa hum
 So i also have to train like that
 yahaan tak ki meraa cardio seshan bhihai intencitika hota he
 Training is done by wearing a mask of high altitude where you cannot even breathe properly
 aapako apane fefdon ko badhanaa hota he
 i do all these practices
 yah sab interval training kaa hissaa hai
 This is the way to know what your body wants in the field
 isliye yah bahut hi aasaan calculation he lekin isaki samaj awarenes se hi aa paati he
 It is most needed on the field and it plays with you till the end
 sachin tendulkar ke saath aapaki tulana hoti he to kaisaa mahasoos hota he? sachin tendulkar kii biography likhane hone ke kaaran main jaanata hum ki aapke or unke bich ke sambandh kaaphi achche hai
 Everyone is comparing you and them
 sach kahuun to yah sunakar mujhe kaaphi kharaab lagata he kyonki yah unke liye sahi nahin he
 Sachin cannot be compared to anyone, this is my own view
 darasal yah isliye sahi nahin he kyonki ham alag-alag calibur ke batsman kii tulana ek saath karte hai
 My game has been improving year after year, but those are some who were born with a good quality
 unhone lagaataar 24 saal is cheez ko banaae rakhaa
 It is not fun to do so
 abhi main do yaa teen saal se hi acha parform kar rahaa hum isliye itani jaldi tulana karnaa kahin se bhi jaij nahin he
 Whenever i think of him, i am impressed but i want to be the only one who is inspired by Sachin
 darasal sachin aise hai jinase ham logon ne bahut kuch siikhaa he
 So the learner and the learner cannot be compared in the same category
 is jenereshan ke jitne khilaadi khel rahe hai, sachin unase do level upar hai
 How can you compare someone with 100 centuries? jab bhi wo 100 score karte the, log unase or zyada kii ummid karte the
 
 aap kaaphi acchhee baaten bhi kar lete hai or aapke shabd bhi kaaphi sadhe hue hote hai
 But will you tell us something about your regression? You are doing it right
 meraa matlab he ki yah kuch aisa he, jiske saath main paidaa hua hum
 My father was Leo so i can understand where this regression comes from
 main khud scorpiyo hum
 The sign of this Jodiak indicates to be very stubborn and to keep his words firmly in place
 darasal agreshan yaheen se aata he
 i have already told that it is in our family only
 main maanata hum ki maine kabhi-kabhi agreshan kii simaaen bhi todi hai
 But i am glad that i have learned a lot from these mistakes
 maine yah siikhaa or janaa he ki kya karnaa chahie or kya nahin
 But i have never run away from hard work
 maine kabhi apana agreshan dusron ke kaaran nahin badla
 Yes, when i felt it was needed, i did it because i felt that it wastes your energy unnecessarily which i can use in my game
 vahiin, duusari taraf jab agreshan kii jarurat energy ke liye ho to main hameshaa iskaa upyog karata hum

 -input IANS The farmers of Chhattisgarh are forced to throw the barely grown tomatoes on the streets once again
 iskaa kaaran he ki tomaataron kii paidaavaar se kisaan laagat to dur, mazdooree tak nahin nikal paa rahe hai
 As a result, farmers are neither ready to harvest tomatoes nor to take it out of the fields to middlemen
 bichauliye ek se do rupee prati kilo kii keemat par tamaato kharid rahe hai
 In various areas of the state, these tomato middlemen are sending them to the mandis at the cost of five to seven rupees per kg
 aam graahakon tak yahatmatodas se pandrah rupee prati kilo tak pahunch rahaa he
 Durg, Rajnandgaon, Bemetra, Dhamtar, Mahasamund, Balod, Surajpur, Jashpur and Ambikapur districts are famous for tomato yield in the state

 The tomato-producing farmers refused to sell the tomatoes at Rs 1-2 a kg and decided to destroy them
 dhamdha block ke parsoli gaanv ke ramchandra sahu ke mutabik bichauliye 1-2 rupee prati kilo tak bamushkil tamaato kharidne ko taiyaar hai, jabaki itnaa kharch to maatr tamaato todane par aa rahaa he
 To save the crop from tomato yield, sowing, hard work and insect mites, the cost on it is more than four and a half rupees per kg
 aise main tamaato kaa utpaadan unke liye ghate kaa sauda he
 These farmers have now decided not to grow tomatoes
 unke mutabik unhen tamaato kaa laagat mulya bhi nahin mil paa rahaa he
 In such a situation, they should produce only another crop

 According to the farmers, on the one hand, their cost is also not getting the price, while on the other hand, the middlemen and vegetable wholesalers are making a profit of 3 to 5 rupees per kg
 bataa den ki kuch samay pehle aise hi halaat bane the jab tamaato ke daam girane se kisaanon ne uskaa utpaadan hi nahin kiya tha natijatan tamaato kii keemten aasmaan chune lagi thim or tamaato 90 se 100 rupee prati kilo tak bika tha
 Vegetable production in a large part of Chhattisgarh is tremendous
 cash crop ke chalate zyaadaatar kisaan tamaato kii fasal ko praathamikta ke saath utpaadit karte hai, lekin ab kisaan isaki paidaavaar ko lekar dare hue hai
 According to him tomato production is proving harmful, on the other hand it is not possible to keep it in cold storage
 yahi nahin tamaato se koi or utpaada nahin banataa
 Units producing tomato ketchup are also not in the state
 aise main unki fasal ko kharidne vaala bazaar bhi muhaiyaa nahin he jiske chalate zyaadaatar kisaan apni fasal ko sadakon par phenkane ko majaboor hai

 skool kaam nahin kar rahaa, rashan dukaan kaam nahin kar rahaa, aspataal kaam nahin kar rahaa
 Nobody works, and you have no choice but to just and only beg
 uske baad aadmi thak jaataa he, haar jaataa he
 If you give all this power to the public, give it to the gram sabha
 skool yaa aspataal chahie to gram sabha tay kare
 If the responsibility of running your village is given to them, if there is direct public participation in some policies of the Center and the state
 mujhe lagata he ki isse algaavvaadiyon kii takat desh main kam ho jaaegi
 On women's reservation
 hamane to apni party ke andar commit kiya he ki hamaare ek-tihaai ummidavaar or ek-tihaai padaadhikari mahilaayein hongi
 In caste selection in candidate selection
 aaj kii vot bank kii raajnneeti kii vajah se in partiyon ne desh or samaaj ko dharm or jati ke aadhaar par buree tarah se tod diya he
 We feel that the movement has created an atmosphere due to which these walls have been broken to a large extent
 raajnneeti ne hi desh ko todaa he or hamen lagata he ki raajnneeti hi desh ko jod sakati he
 We will try with all sincerity to change this politics which is breaking the country today and try to connect it
 jab janchetana kaa ubhaar aata he, jaise is andolan ke dauraan aayaa
 There were many corrupt officials whom no one told them not to take bribe
 unki aatma ne jhakzora or unhone aakar hamase kaha ki hamane rishwat lenaa band kar diya he
 In the same way, if this election also becomes a movement, then i think these walls will slowly start to crumble
 bhrashtachar aaj desh ke liye sabase bada secular mudda he
 On raising election funding
 paise kii kabhi dikkat nahin hogi
 If we contest elections on the basis of money, then we will lose because money, muscle power, caste and religion are elections in their name
 agar unke akhaade main jaakar ladenge to ham sab haar jaaenge, ve to hamen do minute main hawa main uda denge
 Our arena is movement, honesty and transparency
 agar hamane unako apane akhaade main bula liya chunaav ladgaye ke liye or bina paise ke, to vahaan wo nahin tik paaenge
 People come to us by closing work, hopefully
 ve desh badalanaa chaahate hai
 If women, children, old, young people will come out of every house for campaigning, then what is the need for money
 is chunaav ko hi andolan bananaa he
 On missing Anna
 (maayusi se) bahut prabhaav padegaa, isamen koi shaq nahin he
 If Anna was actively together, he would have benefited a lot and would have been better
 kapil sibbal ke khilaaf chunaav ladgaye ke anna ke suzav par?maine is bare main sochaa nahin he
 On resolving the Ram Janmabhoomi dispute
 isamen abhi party ne koi chintan nahin kiya he
 Everyone is bad in politics, so why do you jump? What is the thinking of the family? That will have to be cleaned in the mud
 abhi apane upar to vishwaas he kyonki inkam tex vibhaag bhi vaisaa hi keechad tha, par mujhe chhu nahin paaya
 No mud will touch me, but there should be such a system inside our party that if something goes wrong, it can be rectified properly, otherwise the confidence of the people will be lost

 But we all countries should be on a level playing field

 As far as FDI in retail is concerned, we were told that if it is implemented in the retail sector, employment will increase, farmers will get better benefits of their produce, consumers will get things at a cheaper rate, the chain of cold storage Will stand up

 The idol of Dhari Devi, considered to be the form of Mother Kali, was removed from her ancient temple on the evening of 16 June
 uttarakhand ke srinagar main hidle-power project ke liye aisa kiya gaya tha
 Hours after the statue was removed, only a few hours after the destruction came in Kedarnath and hundreds of people were killed in the disaster
 vishwa hindu parishad ke ashok singhl ne kaha, 'logon ne hydro power project ke khilaaf pradarshan kiya tha or dhari devi kii pratimaa ko hataae jane kaa virodh kiya tha
 Despite this, the statue of Dhari Devi was removed on 16 June
 dhari devi ke gusse se hi kedarnath or uttarakhand ke anya ilaakon main tabaahi machi
 Dhari Devi wanted to convince the atheists of the country not to touch the Himalayas and the rivers here
 'is ilaake main dhari devi kii bahut manyata he
 People believe that her face in the statue of Dhari Devi has changed over time
 ek ladki se ek mahila or phir ek vruddh mahila kaa cheharaa bana
 The mythological belief that once the entire temple was swept away in a severe flood, the idol of Dhari Devi was left in a rock-bound Dharo village
 gaanvvaalon ko dhari devi kii ishwariya aawaaj sunai di thi ki unki pratimaa ko vahiin sthapit kiya jaae
 This is the reason why the statue of Dhari Devi was opposed to the removal of her idol from her temple
 yah mandir srinagar se 10 kilometre dur paudi gaanv main he
 The work on the 330 MW Alkhananda Hydro Power Project is still in progress
 logon ke virodh ke chalate hi ye project jo 2011 tak puraa ho janaa chahie tha abhi tak is par kaam chal rahaa he
 As soon as there was talk of transferring the idol of Dhari Devi, the people's opposition to the project started from a new level
 bich kaa rasta nikaalte hue project ne faisla liya ki power project se dur dhari devi ke mandir ko sthanantarit kiya jayega
 The platform was erected to move the statue of Dhari Devi, but it was becoming difficult for the power project company and the temple committee to displace her statue
 16 june ko jab mandakini nadi main baadh aana shuru hui to mandir kamity ne dhari devi kii pratimaa bachaane ke liye turant ection liya
 According to Devi Prasad Pandey, former secretary of Dhara Devi Temple Committee, 'by evening, the temple was flooded with knees
 aisi khabaren thim ki raat tak bahut tej barish hone vaali he
 So there was no other way than to remove the idol of Dhara Devi

 kehete hai ki ek atom bam ek puri kii puri nasl ko tabah karne ke liye kaaphi he or is vakt puri duniya main aise ek-do nahin balki 15493 atom bam hai
 And this count will increase further because many countries are still secretly or openly making atom bombs
 inamen sabase upar naam uttar korea kaa he
 By the way, after the terrorist attack on the army camp in Uri, the tension between India and Pakistan is increasing, it is important to know that how many nuclear bombs India and Pakistan have and whose bomb can kill far away
 is
 sarhad ke us paar bhi or sarhad ke is paar bhi tanaav baraabar bana hua he
 Every option is said to be open after the terrorist attack on the army camp in Uri on Sunday
 javaabi karrwai, javaabi hamalaa, kootneeti se maar, raajnneeti se chit, yahaan tak ki jang tak ladane kii baat kii ja rahi he
 Then everyone suddenly realizes that both India and Pakistan are countries equipped with nuclear bombs
 kahin donon main parmaanu yuddh chhid gaya to kya hoga?bharat-paak ke paas kitne atom bam?is vakt puri duniya main kul 15493 parmaanu bam hai, jo 13 hajaar kilometre se lekar 15 hajaar kilometre kii duuri tak maar kar sakate hai
 According to experts, if half of these atomic bombs are also used, then the world map will be erased
 is vakt rus ke paas 7300 parmaanu bam, america ke paas 7100, france ke paas 300, china ke paas 260, england ke paas 215, pakistan ke paas 120, bharat ke paas 110, israel ke paas 80 or uttar korea ke paas 8 parmaanu yani atom bam hai
 India can fall far away Atom, Russia possesses the largest number of nuclear bombs, the only nuclear bomber to hit the longest distance
 rus 11 hajaar se 15 hajaar kilometre kii duuri tak parmaanu bamon se hamalaa kar saktaa he
 Whereas the US has nuclear bombs that range from 9650 kilometers to 13 thousand kilometers
 pakistan ke paas bhale hi bharat se das parmaanu bam zyada hai magar jahaan tak duuri kii baat he to pakistan 1300 kilometre tak hi bam gira saktaa he jabaki bharat kii maarak kshamta zyada he
 India can rain atomic bombs up to two thousand kilometers away, that is, almost all of Pakistan comes under the cover of India's nuclear bomb
 atom bam kaa nayaa khatraparmaanu bamon ko lekar pehle se hi duniya pareshaan he
 Now even the crazed dictator of North Korea has jumped in this race that only one test is being conducted one after the other
 aath parmaanu bamon se las uttar korea agle teen maheene ke andar 25 or aise bam banane kaa elaan kar chukaa he
 He has also done some tests
 uttar korea kaa sanakee taanashaah paanch atom bam kaa puri kamyaabi ke saath pareekshan kar chukaa he lekin iske baavjood uskaa ji nahin bharaa he
 He wants to make 20 more Atom bombs in the next three months, before the end of the year
 or khabar he ki iske liye usne jaruri uranium bhi juta liya he
 One Atom bomb is enough to erase an entire breed
 ab jaraa sochie 25 atom bamon kaa wo kya karegaa?kai qaraar tuutane ke baavjood kar rahaa pareekshanuttar korea ke sanakee taanashaah kim jong un ne pichley nau maheenon main jo harakat kii he, usne padosi mulk dakshin korea samet puri duniya ko daraa diya he
 On the insistence of eccentric dictator Kim Jong Un, sitting on the highest chair of the country, the scientists of this country are making nuclear bombs one after the other, while also testing them openly at their nuclear center
 or aisa tab ho rahaa he jab america samet takreeban puri duniya ne uttar korea ke saath apane saare rishte khatm kar liye hai
 And these include the interchange of nuclear technology and other relationships
 lekin iske baavjood uttar korea ne in bamon ke pareekshan se jahaan ye sabit kar diya he ki wo bhi duniya ke atomi takat vaale mulkon main shaamil he, vahiin ye bhi dikhaa diya he ki apane dushmano se nipatane main wo kisi duusare mulk kaa mohataaj nahin
 The new revelation is shocking, but testing only two nuclear bombs in a year was not enough
 uttar korea ko lekar ab jo nayaa khulaasa hua he, wo or bhi chaunkaanewaala he
 According to experts, North Korea is preparing to make 20 more nuclear bombs
 is mulk ne iske liye teen maheene kaa torget tay kiya he
 They have already mobilized uranium to make nuclear bombs
 jabaki parmaanu bam banane kii takanic uske paas pehle se maujuud he
 In such a situation, tension is yet to increase in this entire sub-continent
 america de chukaa he munhtod javabwaise uttar korea kii in harkaton se is ilaake main tanaav kaa andaja sirf isi baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he
 While South Korea has already called it provocative action, the US has also tried to send a message to North Korea by flying its fighter jet on the sky of South Korea if it is trying to show the world including South Korea If it is, then it too may have to pay a heavy price
 pakistan kar rahaa he madbais bich uttar korea ke paas maujuud uranium ko lekar kai antarrashtriya sutron ne pakistan kii taraf oongli uthaai he
 They say that it is Pakistan which is secretly trying to earn money by supplying uranium to North Korea
 or pakistan uttar korea ko uranium bhi beche de rahaa he, jo usne china se newclear samjhaute ke tahat hasil kiye hai
 Although Pakistan should undoubtedly deny these things, experts claim that in recent years many North Korean diplomats visited Pakistan only to get uranium
 tabaahi kii taraf bad rahaa uttar korea9 agast ko apane sthapana diwas ke maukey par is saal ke duusare parmaanu pareekshan se aas-paas ke ilaake main jaljla laanevaale is mulk ke bashindon ne bhi is parmaanu bam kii khushi main jo jashn manaaya he, wo dekhanevaala he
 Viewers also see it as an attempt to appease the country’s eccentric dictator Kim Jong
 lekin jis tarah uttar korea kii rajdhani pyongang main is duusare pareekshan ke baad lakhon logon ne ek raily nikaal kar apni khushi kaa izhaar kiya, usase ye sabit ho chukaa he ki uttar korea ke sanakee taanashaah kim jong un ke saath-saath vahaan ke aam log bhi kis teji se tabaahi kii ore bad rahe hai
 There can be a population of crores in minutes, devastated by this, guess how and how big will be the extent of its destruction? Just understand that if such a hydrogen bomb falls on a big city with a population of one crore, it will not take more than a minute for the entire city to become a crematorium
 itihaas gavaah he6 or 9 agast 1945 ko japan ke do shaharon haroshima or nagasaki par hue parmaanu bamon ke ye dhamaake aaj bhi itihaas ke wo syah panne hai, jinhen yaad karne bhar se rongte khadey ho jate hai
 Then only two atomic bombs killed more than two and a quarter lakh people in these two cities of Japan
 sabase khatarnaak hathiyaar he hidrogen batchb jaraa sochie, us hidrogen bam kii jo in do shaharon par giraae gaye aise kisi bhi parmaanu bam se sau guna zyada shaktishaalee hai
 If such a bomb is dropped on a city, what will be the result? Just understand that a hydrogen bomb can completely destroy any city with a population of crores and a half crores in minutes
 or yahi vajah he ki is vakt agar duniya main tabaahi kaa koi sabase bada saamaan maujuud he, to wo hidrogen bam hi he
 What is a Hydrogen bomb? Actually, it is a kind of atomic bomb and it uses elements like du terium and tritarium like hydrogen
 parmaanuon ke fus karne se bam main dhamaakaa hota he or iske liye lagbhag 5 karod degree centegrade ke garmi kii jarurat padati he
 And this summer is even hotter than the hottest part of the sun
 jab parmaanu bam ye garmi paidaa karata he, tab jaakar hydrogen parmaanu fus hota he or isse jo garmi paidaa hoti he, wo hydrogen ko helium main tabdeel kar detii he
 Many countries were equipped with hydrogen bombs in 1922 before scientists discovered the power of the explosion of the hydrogen atom
 iske baad 1932 main duterium naam ke baari hydrogen kaa or 1934 main tritirium naam ke duusare baari hydrogen kaa izaad kiya gaya
 Then in 1950, US President True Man ordered the preparation of a hydrogen bomb

 The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), which once took the birth of all the political parties of the country as useless and unacceptable and claims to change politics, today seems to be looking for its future solely on the basis of coalition politics

 The Aam Aadmi Party feels that the Dalit voters in Punjab did not have an option, so they were forced to vote for the Congress or the Shiromani Akali Dal / BJP alliance, but now when the Aam Aadmi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party will contest together, the Dalits will have a a better alternative would be to vote in large numbers against the Aam Aadmi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party

 ab nyaayalay nirnay karegaa ki kya is skool kaa sanchaalan karne vaali sosayadi ko samvidhan ke tahat rajya yaa uski sahaayak mana ja saktaa he or isliye vah sheersh adaalat or ucch nyaayalay ke adhikaar kshetra ke daayre main aata he
 Earlier, the government had told the apex court that apart from Central Government group-a officers, children of other government employees could also be given admission under 60 per cent quota
 ucch nyaayalay ne pichley saal chah november ko samskruti skool main 60 fisadi kota nirast karte huye apane faisle main kaha tha ki yah to america main kabhi gore or ashweton ko alag alag karne jaisaa hi he ore isse samvidhan main pradutt samta or shiksha ke adhikaar kaa hanan hota he
 The apex court had agreed to hear the appeal filed against the decision of the High Court on 15 December last year
 is skool main 60 fisadi siten samooh-e ke adhikariyon ke bacchon ke liye arakshit hai jabaki 25 fisadi siten aarthik rup se kamjor varg, das fisadi siten shesh sosayadi or paanch fisadi siten apane karmchaariyon ke bacchon ke liye arakshit hai
 The comments ucch nyaayalay ne apane faisle main kaha tha ki tamaam visheshgy aayogon ne kaha he ki bharat or videshon main maujuuda schuli vyavastha suvidha sampann or suvidhahin virgo ke bich khai chaudee kar rahaa he
 The High Court automatically took cognizance of this in 2006, after reports surfaced that about 40 per cent less fees were charged from children of group-a officers
 isse pehle, sarkaar ne sheersh adaalat se kaha tha ki kendra sarkaar ke samooh-e ke adhikariyon ke alaava anya sarkari karmchaariyon ke bacchon ko bhi 60 fisadi cote ke tahat pravesh diya ja saktaa he
 On November 6 last year, the High Court, in its decision repealing the 60% quota in the Sanskriti School, said that it is like separating whites and blacks from America at any time and thereby violating the equality and right of education provided in the Constitution
 it happens
 sheersh adaalat pichley saal 15 disambar ko ucch nyaayalay ke faisle ke khilaaf daayar apil par sunwaayee ke liye sahamat ho gai thi
 In this school, 60 per cent seats are reserved for the children of group-a officers, while 25 per cent seats are reserved for the economically weaker sections, ten per cent seats for the remaining societies and five per cent seats for the children of its employees
 tippaniyan The High Court said in its judgment that all the expert commissions have said that the existing schooling system in India and abroad is widening the gap between the affluent and disadvantaged sections

 uttar pradesh kii phulpur or gorakhpur loksabhaa seat par hue upachunaav main bijepi ko karaari haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa he
 In Gorakhpur, Yogi's work place for the last thirty years, BJP candidate Upendra Shukla was defeated by Praveen Kumar of SP
 vahiin aazaadee ke baad pehali baar 2014 main modi lahar main phulpur jeetne ke baad upachunaav main bijepi ke kaushalendra patel ko sapa pratyaashee nagendra patel ne buree tarah se shikast di he
 Explain that after becoming the Chief Minister last year, Yogi Adityanath resigned after becoming Deputy CM of Gorakhpur Lok Sabha and Keshav Prasad Maurya
 jiske baad upachunaav hue hai, jin par basapa ke samarthan se sapa jeet darj karne main kaamyaab rahi he
 There have been five reasons for bjp's defeat in the by-elections, due to which the BJP could not save the parliamentary seats of Yogi and Keshav
 upachunaav main bijepi kii haar ke 5 kaaran-1
 Chief minister Yogi Adityanath and deputy cm's feud is well known in the feud between Yogi and Keshav
 donon ke bich kii dushmani bijepi ke liye upachunaav main haar kii vajah bani
 Yogi and Keshav wanted to see the defeat of the BJP candidate from each other's parliamentary seats to maintain their supremacy
 isi ke maddenjar ek duusare kii seat par par donon bijepi ke diggaj netaaon ne 2014 loksabhaa or 2017 vidhansabha chunaav jaisi mehnat nahin kiye
 BJP candidates have to pay the same due to defeat
 2
 Gorakhpur Yogi's dislike of BJP candidate Upendra Shukla in Outer Gorakhpur in Phulpur is said to have launched the party against Yogi's will
 yogi upendra kii jagah dharmendra singh ko pratyaashee chaahate the
 The party is said to have fielded Upendra Shukla of the likes of Shiv Pratap Shukla
 mana jaataa he isi kaa khamiyaja upendra shukla ko haar ke rup main chukaana padaa he
 In Phulpur, BJP candidate Kaushalendra Patel was outshone
 kaushalendra patel chunaar ke hai or varanasi se siyasat karte rahe hai
 The party fielded him for being a Patel-dominated seat in Phulpur
 vahiin sapa ne phulpur kshetra ke nagendra patel ko tikat diya
 Nagendra Kaushalendra prevailed in the middle of outsider versus regional Patel
 3
 The SP-BSP has defeated the 23-year-old rivalry by defeating the opposition's social engineering in Gorakhpur and Phulpur by-elections
 iske chalate donon siton par obisi-dalit ke saath-saath muslim matadaata ekajute hokar sapa ummidavaar ke saath khadey rahe or unhen kanfusion kii haalat se guzarana nahin padaa
 Whereas BJP could not succeed in creating social engineering in the by-elections
 1993 kii tarah phir ek baar sapa-basapa kii ekajutata jeet main badal gai
 4
 ek saal main feekaa padaa bhagavaayaha sawaal uthta he ki ek saal pehle vaali modi lahar ab mand padane lagi he
 The BJP did not have any major achievement in Yogi's rule of the year
 modi or yogi haseen sapane dikhaakar or vaade karke soobe kii siyaasi jang fatah kiya tha
 That color is now beginning to fade
 isi kaa khamiyaja gorakhpur or phulpur loksabhaa upachunaav main bijepi ko haar ke rup main chukaana padaa he
 5
 upachunaav main bijepi kii lagaataar harupachunaav main bijepi ko 2014 ke baad se lagaataar haar kaa silsilaa jari he
 The defeat that the BJP has lost due to the election in ratlam-jhabua Lok Sabha seat of Madhya Pradesh, the same result was seen in Gurudaspur in Punjab, Ajmer in Rajsthan, and Phulpur and Gorakhpur in UP via Alwar
 haalanki upachunaav main sattadhari party ko jeet milti he, lekin bijepi ke saath ulataa ho rahaa he
 Tara Sutaria, who started her career with the film Student of the Year 2, has managed to leave her mark
 haalanki ve isse pehle bhi antertanment industry se judi rahi hai or unhone vije ke taur par kaam kiya he
 Tara Karan Johar's film received considerable notice, but her recent picture has compared her to Bollywood's most popular baby
 haal hi main tara ne apni ek bachapan kii tasviir instagram par share kii he
 Tara looks very cute in this picture

 The entire nation is eyeing the voting on Sunday in two Lok Sabha seats in UP
 gorakhpur loksabhaa seat par bijepi apni jeet tay maanakar chal rahi thi kyonki ye siem yogi kii karmbhumi he
 But low voting has cast doubt on the party's belief
 vahiin phulpur sansadeey seat ko lekar bijepi ko pehle se hi basapa samarthit sapa ummidavaar se kadaa muqabla dikh rahaa tha
 In such a situation, the restlessness of the ruling BJP has increased even more
 vahiin 23 saal puraani dushmani ko bhuulakar dosti kaa haath milaane vaale sapa-basapa kii saansen bhi rukii hui hai
 Let us know that the Phulpur and Gorakhpur by-elections of Uttar Pradesh are being considered as the semi-finals of 2019
 phulpur or gorakhpur donon sansadeey siton par ravivaar ko matdaan hua
 The fate of the candidates has been captured in EVM

 Voting has reduced this time compared to the last Lok Sabha election
 2014 loksabhaa chunaav kii tulana main gorakhpur main 7
 24 per cent and 12 in Phulpur
 4 fisadi voting kam hui he
 Durg Gorakhpur of Gorakhpur BJP is considered to be a strong fort of BJP
 1989 se ye seat bijepi ke paas he
 Yogi Adityanath resigned from the Lok Sabha membership here after becoming MP of UP last year after being an MP for the last five times
 gorakhpur loksabhaa seat par hue upachunaav main 47
 The turnout was 4 percent
 jabaki 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main 54
 64 percent of the votes were cast, which is 7
 24 pratishat vot kam he
 The confident bjp's hopes for victory in Gorakhpur have started to waver
 yogi ne teen lakh se jeet hasil kii thi2014 ke voting or nateezon ke sameekaran ko dekhen to us dauraan kul 10 lakh 40 hajaar 199 matadaataaon ne apane matadhikaar kaa prayog kiya tha
 Yogi Adityanath received 5 lakh 39 thousand 127 votes in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 sapa ummidavaar rajmati nishad ko 2 lakh 26 hajaar 344 vot mili, vahiin basapa pratyaashee ram bhual nishad ko 1 lakh 76 hajaar 412 vot mili the
 Apart from this, the Congress had got only 45 thousand 719 votes
 yogi ne is seat ko 3 lakh 12 hajaar 783 voton se jeet darj kiya tha
 44 in Gorakhpur in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections
 13 fisadi vot pade the
 BJP candidate Yogi got 4 lakh 3 thousand 156 votes, BSP got 1 lakh 82 thousand 885 votes, SP got 83 thousand 59 votes and Congress got just 30 thousand votes
 1991-98 main bijepi ko sapa ne kadi takkar deepichley 5 loksabhaa chunaavon kii baat karen to 1991 or 1998 main jahaan bijepi ko samaajawaadee party se kadi takkar milti dikhi thi
 At the same time, the BJP has won unilaterally since 2004
 is baar ke upachunaav main bijepi pratyaashee upendra shukla ko basapa samarthit sapa ummidavaar praveen nishad se kadi takkar kii ummid maani ja rahi he
 In such a situation, low voting is again reminiscent of 90 election
 phulpur main bijepi duusari baar jeet darj kar paaegi?aazaadee ke baad bijepi pehali baar modi lahar main 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main phulpur seat par apni jeet kaa paracham lahraane main kaamyaab hui thi
 The low voting has raised doubts over the bjp's hopes of retaining its kingship in Phulpur parliamentary seat, considered a political legacy of Nehru
 12
 4 percent votes fall for Phulpur by-election 37
 4 fisadi matdaan hua he
 While 50 in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 2 fisadi matdaan hua tha
 So this time 12
 4 fisadi voting kam hui he
 In such a situation, the BJP is not very confident of winning
 pehali baar bijepi kaa khulaa tha khatakeshav prasad maury bijepi ummidavaar ke taur par 2014 main phulpur seat se saansad bane, lekin march 2017 main upi ke dipti siem banane ke baad unhone yahaan se istipha de diya
 In view of the votes polled in the Lok Sabha elections 2014, Keshav Maurya of BJP received 5 lakh 3 thousand 564 votes out of total 9 lakh 60 thousand 341 votes
 2009 kii tarj par votingspi ummidavaar dharm singh patel ko 1 lakh 95 hajaar 256 vot, bispi pratyaashee kapilmuni karvariyaa ko 1 lakh 63 hajaar 710 or congress ke mo
 Kaif received 58 thousand 127 votes
 vahiin 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav main 38
 There was 69 per cent voting and the BSP managed to win and BJP was fourth
 bijepi ko 50 hajaar vot bhi nahin mil sake the
 Whereas during that time also BJP candidates were from Patel community
 is baar bhi 2009 ke chunaav ke kareeb hi voting hui he
 In such a situation, it cannot be said that BJP can retain the victory in Phulpur

 They had keys and blades made from rust-ridden utensils and old oil canisters
 unka kaam aasaan karne ke liye vahaan teen inten or ek steel kaa pipe bhi tha
 The attackers pulled out a prisoner from an 8x8-foot closet surrounded by a ten-foot-high boundary wall and a brick courtyard
 teen minute main unka kaam khatm ho chukaa tha
 The clock in Lahore was ringing at five in the evening
 isse 40 kimi se bhi kam duuri par sthit bhikhivind main uski badi bahan, 58 varshiya dalbir cor apni kalai par bandhi ghadi kii ore dekh rahi thim, yah sochate hue ki ‘‘pakistan main ab asr kii namaaj kaa vakt ho rahaa hoga,’’ sarbajit thodi hi der main raat ke khaane main pani jaisi daal or rotiyaan khayega
 He came to know this because of going to Kot Lakhpat three times to see his brother
 lekin unke chote bhai ke liye ek se zyada manahuus niyati intjaar kar rahi thi
 Sarabjit Singh, 49, who has been on the path of death for nearly 22 years, could not stand for a single moment
 unhen yah purv abhas ho gaya tha ki ve log uske saath kya karne vaale hai
 Within minutes of being pulled out of the safety of his cell, he fell to the ground with blood clots, broken limbs and a broken skull
 hamalavar tab hi deele pade, jab unhen bharosa ho gaya ki unke shithil pad chuke sharir main jaan bilkul nahin bachi he
 The security guards who were easily evacuated so that the killers could do their job quietly returned

 This special ICU was made for him in an empty room of the hospital, but even the best surgeons of Pakistan failed to save his life
 unke maayoos parivaar ke bharat lautne ke kuch hi ghanton baad 2 may ko aadhi raat main unhone sarbajit ko ‘mrit’ ghoshit kar diya
 Sarabjit's death sparked a wave of anger all over India and many people became angry with the central government for failing to save Sarabjit
 amritsar ke paas sthit unke gaanv bhikhivind main raat bhar chalaa mombatti juluus logon ke baari virodh pradarshan main badal gaya jisamen logon ne pakistani jhande jalaae

 Jail officials said the blasphemous attack on Sarabjit was the result of a 'feeling of extreme hatred' towards him as he was allegedly the mastermind of two bomb blasts in Faisalabad (lailpur) and Lahore in August 1990 that killed 10 people
 Had gone
 yah hamalaa pakistan ke puraane jamaane vaali jail vyavastha kii bhayaavah kahani ko bayaan karata he
 Vinod Sahni, 60, calls it a "cemetery of people alive"
 is purv sainik ne jasusi ke aarope main sialkot, multan, sahiwal or kot lakhapat main 11 saal (1977-1988) gujaarey hai
 He now heads the former Intelligence Association, an organization of about 60 former spies in Jammu

 He says that some very fortunate people are able to survive after spending so many years of torture
 unhone bataaya ki sahiwal kii central jail main 1971 ke baad phir se shikanje kaa istemaal shuru kar diya gaya
 Screws are a terrible tool used for torture during the old days of the British Raj
 isamen kaidiyon ko is mashin par nirvastr litayaa jaataa he jo steel ke ek bade drum se bani hoti he, isaki puri bahari sataha par nukile keel lage hote hai
 They are laid until the back of their body is completely deformed
 britain kii vakil jasbir uppal varsh 2007 main sarbajit kii durdasha kii kahani jaanane ke baad naagarik aazaadee kii sakriy andolankaaree ban chuki hai
 Uppal said that many such Indians are languishing in Pakistani jails who have not come in the eyes of the international community
 inamen se bahut se log 1971 yuddh ke yudhbandi hai or vah iske baad se lagaataar yatnaa sah rahe hai
 These people are forced to live in captivity in Pakistan and they cannot find any indication to ask their condition from India
 november, 2012 main uppal ne pakistan kii adaalaton, sanyukt raashtra maanavadhikaar ayukta (oechasiechaaar) ke geneva offis, human ritis watch, emnesti international or salmaan khurshid ko ram das or mangal singh ke bare main ek yachika di
 Both these Indian spies were jailed in December 1971 and they are still lodged in Kot Lakhpat Jail
 haal main hi gat 7 march ko unhone british saansadon kii ek sanyukt samiti ko die gyaapan main aise darjanon kaidiyon kaa vivaran diya jinke bare main bahari duniya ko koi jaankaree nahin he
 These include a 15-year-old missing child from Punjab who was found in a Pakistani jail after eight years
 aisa mana jaataa he ki masirah dweep videsh sthit aisa kaidi shivi he, jahaan pakistan ne 1970 ke dashak ke madhya main bahut se yuddh bandiyon ko bheja tha
 None of these names is included in the Foreign Ministry's list of 54 Indian soldiers who disappeared in 1971
 uppal kaa kahana he ki ve yah jaanakar dang rah gayi ki bhartiya raajnneetik vyavastha kis tarah durdasha jhel rahe apane nagarikon ko hi pahchaanane se inkaar kar detii he
 Pakistan's ongoing barbaric treatment of Indian prisoners in the early 1970s continues even today, taking recourse to a humiliating defeat in the 1971 war
 jelon main bhartiya kaidiyon ko khaane ke naam par ab bhi naashte main gud kaa ek tukdaa or adhpaka chhola diya jaataa he or baaki puraa din unhen ghun bhare 233 gram aate se bani chaar chapatiyon or pani jaisi do katori daal ke sahare gujaarna padataa he
 On January 15, 40-year-old Chamel Singh would have been buried in Kot Lakhpat Jail itself, if a volunteer from Pakistan, Tehsim Khan, had not raised his voice
 is maamle ke khul jane ke baad bhi pakistani prashasan ne chamel singh ke shav kii jaanch karne ke liye raji hone main do maheene laga die, sirf apane is daawey par kaayam rahane ke liye ki uski maut ‘heart atake’ se hui he
 Chamel's body was handed over to India on March 15, but his family living in Jammu and Kashmir is still awaiting a copy of the post-mortem report
 sarbajit par 26 april ko hue hamale main bhi kot lakhapat jail ke karmchaariyon kii sanliptata ke sanket mili hai
 Investigations by Deputy Inspector General (jail) Malik Mubashir claimed that Ehsanul Haque and Muhammad Safdar, two warden deployed to protect Sarabjit, also suffered minor injuries after being beaten by two invading prisoners Amar Aftab and Mudassar in an attempt to save him
 Huh
 lekin iske pehle kuch jail karmchaariyon ne jo bayaan die the, unamem hamalaavaron kii sankhya ‘chah’ bataai gai thi, jinamein ve do warden bhi shaamil the jinhen nilambit kar diya gaya he
 Sarabjit's heartbroken family believes that the attack is the result of a big conspiracy involving top jail officials

 vahiin bijepi ke saansad sakshi maharaj ne mukhyamantri mamata banerjee ko hiranya kashyap kii khandaan kaa bataaya he
 In Haridwar, Sakshi Maharaj told Mamata Banerjee of Hiranya Kashyap's clan, who talks about being sent to jail when Jayashree Ram speaks
 unhone kaha ki bengal kaa naam aate hi treta yug kii yaad aati he
 When the demon Raj Hiranya Kashyapa tortured his son by putting him in jail for speaking on Jayshree Ram
 bengal main mamata bhi yahi kar rahi hai
 Jayashree Ram is imprisoned and tortured for speaking
 mamata kahin hiranya kashyap ke khandaan kii to nahin hai?sakshi maharaj ne kaha ki mamata kaa shashan algaavvaad se kam nahin he

 He said this after the police lathi-charged the group of BJP workers who were shouting slogans of Jai Shri Ram during the protest outside the venue where Trinamool Congress leaders were meeting

 Police sources said that the people gathered outside the venue shouted slogans, alleging that the presence of Trinamool Congress leaders like Malik and Madan Mitra, Tapas Roy and Sujit Bose was harmful to peace in the area

 ) In the Mithilanchal region, this fair of Maithil Brahmin grooms takes place every year for seven to 11 days in the month of Jyeshtha or Ashadh, in which the father of the girls selects the worthy groom and takes them with them and then there is a saying of 'chut Mangni Pat Baivah'
 is sabha main yogya var apane pita va anya abhibhavakon ke saath aate hai
 People on the Virgo side interact with the warriors and their families, gather complete information about each other's family, clan-family and decide the relationship if the groom likes it

 He has started a 'chalu Saurath Sabha' campaign on behalf of his organization
 unhone kaha ki is tarah ke meley ke peeche kuch vaigyanik kaaran bhi hai
 Doctors do not even recommend getting married in the same blood group
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki maithil brahman ek hi gotra va mul main shaadi nahin karte
 They believe that by marrying in a separate gotra, children have the best quality
 is meley main vibhinn gotron ke brahman ek saath maujuud hote hai
 Another registrar Vijaychandra Mishra alias Govind ji says that earlier there was not much facility for traffic
 apni kanya ke liye suyogy duulhaa khojna kathin kaary tha, isliye mithilanchal ke sabhi brahman saurath sabha main aakar shaadi tay karte the
 He said that now people here have started living in other states too and they get eligible brides there too
 ladkaa-ladki padhe likhe hai to mil-baithkar faisla le lete hai, yahaan aane kii jarurat nahin padati
 Nevertheless, people definitely come here to get the records registered with the registrar and to write 'principles'

 Jha says, "in Mithilanchal, since ancient times, an annual gathering of marriageable bride and groom has been held on auspicious days for the proper resolution of marital relations
 saurath sabha kaa uddeshy sambandhon kii samaajik shuchita banaae rakhane ke liye samgotri vivaah ko rokna, dahej-pratha kaa unmoolan tathaa var-vadhoo ke sabhi pakshon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue vaivaahik sabandhon ko sweekruti dena tha
 " unhone kaha ki is parampara kaa sakaaratmak nateeja yah rahaa ki mithila main vivaah sanstha hameshaa se majboot sthiti main rahi or saamaajik sambandhon main pragadhata bani rahi
 Nowadays, in view of the increasing cases of divorce, its importance can be understood
 dow
 Jha says that this historical site is a victim of tourism department and administrative neglect
 iske punarnirmaan par jor dete hue unhone bihar sarkaar se saurath sabha sthal par ek saamudayik bhawan ke nirmaan kii maang kii he, jisase isaki koi sthaayee pahchaan ban sake or iske madhyam se mithilanchal main dahej mukt vivaah ko ek abhiyaan ke rup main aage badhaayaa ja sake
 Local villain Vaibhav Mishra says that it is true that people are becoming disillusioned with this gathering
 iskaa pramukh kaaran sarkaar kii upekshapurna niti he
 He said that Saurath Sabha is no longer given the same facilities like traffic, water and electricity
 tippaniyan Mishra is also sorry that the rich Brahmins no longer come here

 itnaa hi nahin is diwali pataakhe jalaana logon ko mahangaa bhi sabit hoga
 In fact, the Supreme Court has banned the stock of firecrackers coming from outside delhi-ncr in view of pollution prevention

 This is a market which is famous for the variety of firecrackers, but this year about 40 temporary shops are not licensed

 Also, there is a ban on bringing stock of firecrackers from other states in delhi-ncr
 isliye sthaayee pataakhaa dukaanon main is saal purana stock hi maujuud he
 This means that many branded firecrackers coming from Sewakashi this Diwali will be out of the reach of people
 supreme court ke agle aadesh tak dilli main pataakhaa vikreta puraane stock hi bech paaenge
 It is also being speculated that due to lack of new stock, firecrackers will be sold expensive

 Mumbai rain is once again in the news
 shahar main shuruaati barish ne jivan or yatayaat ko kaaphi prabhavit kiya he
 Such situations can also occur in the coming days
 vaise bhi barish se hone vaali bhayankar pareshaani ko mumbai ne 2005 or 2017 main dekh hi liya he
 In such a situation, walking in watery roads sometimes becomes our compulsion
 aisi hi sthiti main yadi aap car se chal rahe hon or barish main funs jaaen to in tips kaa dhyaan rakhen-1
 Know the water in the exhaust stop: When driving in the event of severe rain, first of all understand the depth of water on the road, because not every car is an off-road car
 pani se labalab sadakon par dhire chalem or gaadi pehali gear par chalaaen
 Provide the accelerator continuously so that the water does not reach the exhaust and the engine can be saved from spoilage
 2
 Leave the car: If the rain does not take its name and the water level rises, then park your car after seeing a suitable place
 car main bharta hua pani electrical system main short circuit kar saktaa he, jo puure security system ko damege kar saktaa he
 It is also feared that due to technical flaws, the car may be locked from the inside as well as the windows may stop working
 behatar yahi he ki car ko kisi surakshit jagah par chhod kar nikal jaaen
 3
 aise toden khidki:yadi aap kisi takneekee khami kii vajah se aapaki car kaam karnaa band kar de
 In this case, try to leave the car first
 agar daravaaje naa khulen or khidkiyaan bhi band ho to khidkiyaan tod den
 As a precaution, a small hammer should always be placed on the inside of the car
 haalanki agar hathaudaa naa bhi ho to head rest ko kaam main liya ja saktaa he
 Adjustable head rest can be removed and its bottom window can be used for breaking
 khidki todate vakt duuri kaa dhyaan jarur rakhen
 4
 dhire drive karen:sthiti baadh jaisi naa bhi ho aurbarishadhire bhi ho rahi ho, tab bhi visibility or trection kam ho sakate hai
 In such a situation it would be better to drive slowly
 aisi barishon main ekua planning (chakkon par phislan) kii sambhaavnaaen bad jaati hai
 5
 smartphone saath rakhen or afvaahon se bachein:aap car main funs jaaen yaa barish rukne kaa naam naa le to aisi sthiti main sabase pehle apane smartphone ko surakshit rakhane kii koshish karen or bydaree ko bachaane ke liye data of karen yaa power seaving mod on kar den
 Avoid rumors found on whatsapp or any other platform and report the situation to a family member first
 saath hi sambandhit adhikariyon ko bhi kol karen

 K
 shahi, maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantri ek arase se aarthik tangi main jivan basar kar rahe pramod kumaar ko farvari main jivan patari par lautataa laga kyonki unhen lagbhag dhai dashak ke intjaar ke baad adhyaaapak kii naukari mil rahi thi
 But this joy of this trained teacher of Nawada will not last long
 jivan ke 60wein padaav par chal rahe pramod ko isi saal june main ritair hona he
 a similar story is also related to Krishna Kumar of this district
 unhen bhi farvari main naukari mili lekin march main ritair hona he
 For the job of teacher, he took a degree from Nawada Teachers Training College in the session 1971-73
 2006 main jab sanvida par shikshakon ko rakhaa jane laga tab unhen mauka nahin mila
 Hence, farming of one and a half bighas became a compulsion to live life in a tight climate
 arase ke intjaar ke baad prashikshit adhyapakon ke paksh main kuch samay pehle aae supreme court ke faisle se unki ummiden jagin
 In February 2012, Krishnakumar was restored to Chongwa Pansagwa Middle School in Kouakol block
 par hakeekat saamne aane par ve bol pade, ''niraash hona utana khatarnaak nahin, jitna ummiido kaa maranaa
 Pramod and Krishna are not the only such teachers
 supreme court ke aadesh par bihar main 34,540 padon par behaal kiye ja rahe zyaadaatar shikshakon kii vyathaa kuch aisi hi he
 Take Kamata Prasad Singh of Dapota village of Rajauli
 unke pita bhageerath singh unhen apni tarah shikshak bananaa chaahate the
 Kamta also graduated from Aurangabad in 1972-74
 1985 main shikshakon kii bahaali ke liye prashikshit ummidavaaron ke panel main unka naam bhi tha
 As a result of government policies, 16 years ago Bhagiratha passed away with the dream of making his son a teacher
 ab jab kamta 2 march, 2012 ko 60 saal ke hone ja rahe hai to farvari main babhanaur ke middle skool main unki bahaali hui he
 He says, "many of my colleagues are about to retire from big posts, then i have a chance to become a teacher for two months
" kisi vidambnaa he!''pramod, krishnakumar or kamta jaise log phir bhi kismat vaale nikle, jinhen chand maah ke liye shikshak banane kaa mauka to mila
 The dream of becoming a teacher of hundreds of trained candidates in the state was buried with his death
 30-31 janvari ko counselling thi, tabhi 30 janvari ko roh ke kashmaara nivasee shashinath sharma kaa nidhan ho gaya
 Not only this, hundreds of trained candidates who have crossed 60 years of age could not become teachers
 darasal, prashikshit adhyapakon kii pareshaaniyon kii yah kahani dhai dashak puraani he
 Till 1988, the resumption of teachers was based on the preference of trained candidates
 prashikshit adhyapakon kii pareshaani 1991 se us samay shuru hui, jab tatkaaleen sarkaar ne panel ke bajaay bipiessi ke jariye pratiyogi pariksha yojit kar 25,000 shikshakon kii bahaali kii

 Here we are going to tell you the truth of the shootout of up's most dangerous mafia don Sriprakash Shukla
 shriprakash shukla upi main 90 ke dashak kaa don tha
 The pages of newspapers were dyed with the same headlines everyday
 upi police hairaan-pareshaan thi
 The name was known but there was no photograph with the police
 bijnesaman se ugaahi, kidnaping, katl, dakaiti, purab se lekar pashchim tak railway ke theke par ecchhatra raaj
 This was his profession
 or iske bich jo bhi aayaa usne use maarane main jaraa bhi deree nahin kii
 So people were afraid of him even to the police
 aakhirkaar, upi police ke estf ne ek muthbhed main maar giraaya
 The first encounter was the first police encounter on 9 September 1997 with Shriprakash
 police ko khabar mili ki shriprakash apane teen saathiyon ke saath salon main bal katwane lakhanu ke janpath market main aane vaala tha
 Police laid siege all around
 lekin yah oparation naa sirf fail ho gaya balki police kaa ek jawan bhi shahid ho gaya
 After this encounter Sriprakash Shukla's panic increased all over UP
 estf kaa gathanalkhanau sthit sachivalay main upi ke mukhyamantri, grahamantri or dijipi kii ek baithak hui
 In this, a plan was made to form a special force to deal with criminals
 4 may 1998 ko upi police ke tatkaaleen ediji ajayraj sharma ne rajya police ke behtareen 50 javaanon ko chhaant kar special task force (estf) banaai
 The first task of this force was - Shriprakash Shukla, Zinda or Murda
 saadi vardi main tainaat eke 47 se las estf ke javaanon ne lakhanu se gajiabad, gajiabad se bihar, kalakatta, jaipur tak chhapemari tab jaakar shriprakash shukla kii tasviir police ke haath lagi
 Here, the STF was searching for Sriprakash and on the other hand, Shriprakash Shukla had reached Patna from UP to carry out the biggest crime of his career
 patna main mantri kaa murdershriprakash shukla ne 13 june 1998 ko patna sthit indira gandhi hospital ke baahar bihar sarkaar ke tatkaaleen mantri brij bihari prasad kii goli markar hatya kar di
 The minister was killed when security guards were present with him
 wo apni laal batti kii car se utre hi the ki eke 47 se las 4 badmaashon ne unpar firing shuru kar di or vahaan se faraar ho gaye
 With this murder Sriprakash had made it clear that now he has an umbrella rule on railway contracts from east to west
 bihar ke mantri ke katl kaa maamla abhi thanda bhi nahin hua tha ki tabhi upi police ko ek aisi khabar mili jisase police ke haath-paanv phool gaye
 Sriprakash Shukla took the betel nut of the then Chief Minister of UP Kalyan Singh
 6 karod rupee main siem kii supaari lene kii khabar estf ke liye bam girane jaisi thi
 STF came into action and also decided that now it is necessary to apprehend Sriprakash Shukla under any circumstances
 estf ko pataa chalaa ki shriprakash dilli main apni kisi garlfriend se mobile par baaten karata he
 STF took her mobile on surveillance
 lekin shriprakash ko shaq ho gaya
 He started talking to pcos instead of mobile
 lekin use yah nahin pataa tha ki police ne uski garlfriend ke number ko bhi servilans par rakhaa he
 Surveillance revealed that the PCO from whom Sriprakash is calling is in Indirapuram area of ghaziabad
 khabar milte hi upi estf kii team fouran dilli ke liye ravaanaa ho jaati he
 STF did not want to miss this opportunity at any cost
 encounter ke din23 sitambar 1998 ko estf ke prabharee arun kumaar ko khabar milti he ki shriprakash shukla dilli se gajiabad kii taraf aa rahaa he
 As Shriprakash Shukla's car crosses the Vasundhara Enclave, the STF team including Arun Kumar starts following him
 us vakt shriprakash shukla ko jaraa bhi shaq nahin hua tha ki estf uskaa peechha kar rahi he
 As soon as his car entered the deserted area of indirapuram, the STF team suddenly overtook Sriprakash's car and blocked his path
 police ne pehle shriprakash ko sarender karne ko kaha lekin wo nahin mana or firing shuru kar di
 Sriprakash was killed in police retaliation

 mahila ke pita ke vakil ne jor dete hue kaha ki yah ladakiyon ko fansaane kaa racket he
 The apex court has asked the Muslim man to file an affidavit
 court ne usase poocha ki kya usne arya samaaj mandir main shaadi ke baad apana naam badal liya he or apane naam ke badlaav ke liye jaruri kadam uthaae hai

 Professor Jayesh Bellare heads this project
 enditivi se unhone kaha, 'yah utpaada clinical trial ke liye taiyaar he
 We want to bring it to market in the next three to four years, but considering the cost of the project, we now expect help from the government or the industry
 ' IIT showed the dialyzer threads to NDTV that are the secret of this technology
 dialysis darasal ek parishkrut chalni ke zariye khun ko chaanta he
 a glass tube consists of a string of special threads
 is tub main ek taraf se ashuddh khun aata he, or in dhaagon se guzarataa hua shuddh hota jaataa he
 Impurities like uric acid, creatinine present in the blood make the kidneys work by absorbing these threads

 a video of a girl from Kurukshetra is going viral on social media these days, in which she is seen reporting live in the midst of rain
 video main dikh rahi bacchee kaa naam praachi he or uski umr 10 saal he
 The child goes through the water accumulated in the video and explains the problems of the people
 video main vah bataa raheen hai ki yahaan baadh aa chuki he or logon kaa chalanaa-phirana mushkil ho gaya he
 Prachi, who is studying in class six, also takes the name of her cameraman Jyoti in a very interesting way
 is bacchee kii jamkar tarif ho rahi he
 But at the same time, its reporting has raised questions on the system as to what will happen in far-flung areas like Kurukshetra in a rain
 praachi kii camere ne har vah haal bayaan kiya jo is samay vahaan kii janata jhel rahi he
 In journalistic terms, it is called 'citizen Journalism'
 matlab jab koi naagarik khud hi kisi khabar kii reporting karata he
 In the last few years, the prevalence of citizen journalism has increased where the general public is raising issues on its own
 soshal media ke jamaane main citijan jarnalism or bhi aasaan ho gaya he
 Talk at the same time, the governments make big claims of water logging after floods and rains, but in a single rain, the claims of these claims are exposed

 If the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is in a position to form a government in Delhi, a lot of it will depend on its performance in Uttar Pradesh as well as its seats won in Bihar
 saal 2014 ke chunaavon main bhaajapa ke netritv main endie ne shandaar jeet hasil kii thi or tab uske saath nitish kumaar bhi nahin the
 In 2014, the NDA won 31 out of 40 seats in Bihar
 2014 main nitish kumaar kii jadyu akele chunaav ladi thi or vah sirf do siton par simat gai thi
 But, it seems that the BJP was not very confident about winning in Bihar from the beginning
 varanaa, 2 siton par simate jad-you ko 17 siton kaa ekadam aadha hissaa baantkar dena soobe ke bhaajapa netaaon ko bhi gale nahin utraa tha
 In any case, it will not be easy for the NDA to win more than 25 seats this time, according to Bihar BJP sources
 naam na chhapane kii shart par bihar bhaajapa ke ukt netaa kehete hai, 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main bihar main endie kii siten 2014 ke mukaable kam hi hongi or endie ko paanch-chah siton kaa nuksaan ho saktaa he
 However, in Bihar, BJP and JDU had fought together many times before
 2009 main to unhen rajya kii 32 siten hasil hui thim
 Nitish Kumar's charisma failed in the Modi wave in Bihar in 2014, when Nitish Kumar once again came to the nda's court in 2017, it felt that the nda's position in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections will be stronger than in 2014
 haalanki, 2014 main endie kii ghatak rahi rashtriya loksamata party ab endie main nahin he
 Upendra Kushwaha has now joined the Grand Alliance in the matter of seat sharing
 iske baavjood nitish kumaar ke endie main hone kii vajah se bhaajapa yah maanakar chal rahi thi ki is baar 2014 se bhi acha pradarshan rahegaa
 In such a situation, the question is why there are fears of NDA seats falling from Bihar
 jaankaar iske peeche mul rup se do kaaran ginavaate hai
 First, the grand alliance that Tejashwi Yadav has formed on behalf of the Rashtriya Janata Dal, casts the caste equation more accurately than the NDA
 isaki misaal he, nishadon ke netaa mukesh sahani ko saath lenaa
 By bringing his vips together, the grand alliance has succeeded to a great extent in carrying the Nishad society with them on every seat
 khaskar, mujffarpur seat isaki vajah se funs saktaa he
 VIP is contesting on three seats
 isi tarah se daliton ko saath laane kaa kaam mahagathbandhan ne jediu se alag hokar hindustan awam morcha banane vaale bihar ke purv mukhyamantri jithan ram maanjhi ko apane saath laakar kiya he
 With his arrival, a large part of the Dalit society has stood in favor of the Grand Alliance on the seats of South Bihar
 upendra kushvaha ke mahagathbandhan main shaamil hone se bhi endie ko nuksaan hone kii baat kahi ja rahi he
 In some seats, Upendra Kushwaha's supporters are in a position to decide the victory and defeat
 endie ke nuksaan kii ek vajah tikaton ke bantwaare main bhaajapa kaa manamaana ravaiya rahaa he
 For example, the Bhagalpur seat has been the traditional BJP seat, giving it to the JDU is not considered good for the BJP
 usee tarah darbhanga main gopalji thakur ko kamjor mana ja rahaa he or madhubani seat par bhi hukumdev narayan yadav ke putr ashok yadav kamjor hai
 The Grand Alliance has a higher hand than them
 isi tarah congress ke saath kaa laabh bhi kuch siton par mahagathbandhan ko mil rahaa he
 There are some seats where the candidate belongs to an upper caste, and even in those seats, the upper castes who are usually seen with the NDA are showing favor to the Congress candidate
 kul milakar jamini str par mahagathbandhan kaa jatigat sameekaran 2014 ke mukaable adhik majboot dikh rahaa he
 Paswan has similar fears against the BJP
 kaha ja rahaa he ki is baar paswan samaaj endie kaa saath chhod chukaa he
 One reason for this is that Ramvilas Paswan has given 3 of his total 6 seats to his family
 duusari taraf, jad-you kaa mahadalit vot bhi bhaajapa ke paksh main transfar nahin ho rahaa he
 Actually, Nitish Kumar's vote bank also has Muslims and Mahadalit too
