 The police first took out a procession of these accused

 anantpur police ke is bartaav ne kai sawaal khadey kar die hai
 Did the police forget the law in the headlines? aropiyon ne gunaah kiya he yaa nahin
 It is the job of the court to decide and punish them, then why did the police blow the poles? First question - Does the police have the right to punish an accused? The law says that the court has the right to convict and punish the accused
 doosraa sawaal-jab kasuurvaar ko sajaa dene kaa haq sirf adaalat ko he to police ne saream aropiyon kii pitayee kyon kii?teesraa sawaal-anantpur police ne jo kuch kiya he kya use sirf or sirf surkhiyaan batorne kii koshish nahin samajha janaa chahie
 Fourth question - Will there be any action on the policemen who are going to raid public poles? Aaj Tak tried to talk to Guntakal's DSP e Supraja, who came under the question about this
 lekin unhone inkaar kar diya
 The police may have kept silence, but the public barrage has raised some questions, and the silence of the police cannot be answered

 mukhya nyaayadhish kaa pad bahut ahm ohada hota he or sab isaki izzat karte hai, lekin pichley dinon jis tarah se supreme court ke nyaayadhishon ne press vaarta kar karypranali par sawaal uthaae vah durbhagyapurna he
 The judges themselves gave press talks that democracy is in danger and also accused them of playing with the independence of the judiciary
 ve is bare main sijeai se mili bhi 
 However he did not get any success
 press vaarta ke baad se ham chup the or sakaaratmak karrwai kaa intjaar kar rahe the, lekin teen maah biit gaya or koi hal nahin niklaa
 Kapil Sibal said that the Supreme Court's freedom should not be affected
 ham yaa to chup baith kar yah dekhte rahen yaa koi kadam uthaaen
 Now we are doing our duty, but there is no joy in it
 kapil sibbal ne kaha ki notice main sijeai par paanch binduon par sawaal uthaae gaye hai
 Which makes it clear that they have misused the post
 vahiin, congress netaa kapil sibbal ne kaha ki sijeai deepak mishra ne apane pad kii maryaada kaa ulanghan kiya
 The post of Chief Justice is very important and everyone respects it, but the way the Supreme Court judges held press talks in the past and questioned the methodology is unfortunate
 jajon ne khud press vaarta kar kaha ki loktantr khatre main he or unhone nyaaypalika kii swatantraaa se khilwaad kaa aarope bhi lagaaya
 He also met the CJI about this
 haalanki unhen koi safalataa nahin mili
 We were silent and awaited affirmative action after the press conference, but three months passed and no solution was found
 kapil sibbal ne kaha ki supreme court kii swatantraaa par koi aanch nahin aani chahie
 We either sit silently watching it or take some action
 ab ham apana kartavya nibhaa rahe hai, lekin isamen koi khushi nahin he
 Kapil Sibal said that the CJI has been questioned on five points in the notice
 jisase saaf ho jaataa he ki unhone pad kaa durupyog kiya he

 Thousands of people gathered at the funeral of 82-year-old Badni Devi in bikaner
 ye sabhi jain samaaj ke log hai jo badani devi ko antim vidaai dene aae hai
 It is a different matter that this day is not a day of mourning for the people who come because they believe that Badni Devi has actually got liberation
 50 din se santhara upwas par baithi badani devi sirf kuch chammach pani pikar saans le raheen thim
 Badni Devi lived in Bikaner with her three sons-in-law and her grandchildren
 apane aakhri dinon main vah itani kamazor ho gai thim ki bol bhi nahin paati thim
 After fasting for fifty days, Badni Devi of Bikaner gave up his life
 unhone 25 july ko santhara lene ki ichha jaahir kii thi
 The family claims that she refused but she was adamant on taking Santhara
 jain samudaay main santhara vah pratha he jisamen ann-jal tyagkar insaan mrityu ko apanaataa he
 It is believed that it leads to salvation
 supreme court ke antarim aadesh ke baad santhara lekar praan tyaagane kaa yah pehla maamla saamne aayaa
 There was also a dispute about Santhara
 san 2006 main santhara ke khilaaf rajasthan hai court main yachika daayar hui thi
 On this, Rajasthan High Court ordered in August that Santhara is like suicide and it is a punishable offense
 jain samudaay ne kaha ki yah unke dharmik adhikaron kaa ulanghan he
 The Jain community went to the Supreme Court against the order of the Rajasthan High Court, from where an interim order came that Santhara could continue until the case is heard again
 gauratlab he ki har saal jain samaaj ke kuch hi log (sau se zyada nahin) ann- jal tyagkar mrityu ko gale lagane ke liye is upwas ko rakhte hai
 The Jain community sees those who do so with great respect
 tippaniyan But Santhara's critics say that this religious practice shows very backward thinking and should be viewed from the perspective of the debate on euthanasia
 saamaajik kaaryakarta nikhil soni ne santhara par pratibandh lagane ko jaays tehraate hue kaha he ki samudaay main kai log apane ghar ke bujurgon ke prati laaparvaahee ko is pratha kii aad main chupa dete hai

 In the Jain community, Santhara is the practice in which a person adopts death by sacrificing food and water
 mana jaataa he ki isse moksh kii prapti hoti he
 After the interim order of the Supreme Court, this first case of killing Santhara came out
 santhara ko lekar vivaad bhi ho gaya tha
 In 2006, a petition was filed against Santhara in the Rajasthan High Court
 is par rajasthan hai court ne agast main aadesh diya tha ki santhara aatmahatya jaisaa he or yah dandaneey aparaadh he
 The Jain community said it was a violation of their religious rights
 rajasthan hai court ke aadesh ke khilaaf jain samudaay supreme court gaya, jahaan se antarim aadesh aayaa ki santhara jari rah sakati he jab tak maamle kii sunwaayee dubaara nahin hoti
 It is worth noting that every year only a few people (not more than a hundred) of Jain society abandon food-water and embrace this fast to embrace death
 jo log aisa karte hai jain samudaay unhen kaaphi sammaan ke saath dekhtaa he
 The comments lekin santhara ke aalochakon kaa kahana he ki ye dharmik pratha kaaphi pichhadi soch dikhaati he or ise ichhamrityu par chalane vaali bahes ke pariprekshya main dekhnaa chahie
 Social activist Nikhil Soni has justified the ban on Santhara, saying that many people in the community hide their carelessness towards the elderly in their homes under the guise of this practice

 IED main 30 kilogram se zyaada visphotak bharaa hua tha
 What was the impact of the blast, this shows that the vehicle on which the commandos were boarded, the body of the vehicle and the commandos were found scattered up to 800 meters away
 narmada jaise maovadi kader ke alaava lavari gaanv ke chah yuvakon ne bhi hamale main maovadiyon kaa saath diya tha
 These six youths were later arrested and sent to judicial custody
 lavari ke graminon ne shuukravaar subah espi, gatchiroli, shailesh balkawade ko chitthee saunp kar gaanv ke chah yuvakon ko maaf karne kaa anurodh kiya
 It has been said in the letter that these youths were tricked by the Maoists saying that they are fighting for their water, land and forest
 in yuvakon se ye bhi kaha gaya ki sarkaar unke sansadhano ko chhinana chaahati he
 The Maoists were also asked to join these youths in joining the 'revolution' and fighting the system
 lavari gaanv ke logon ne ab maovadiyon ke gaanv main pravesh par pratibandh laga diya he

 actor or kamedian kapil sharma or ishita dutt starer 'firangi' relies ke liye taiyaar he
 This is Kapil's second film after 'kis Kis Ko Pyar Karoon'
 mana ja rahaa he ki kariyar ke lihaaj se ye mahatvapurn film he
 During his second film project, Kapil has gone through a lot of ups and downs
 sunil grover jaise puraane saathiyon ke saath vivaad saamne aae, dosti tuuti or jis jodi ko anterten ke liye janaa jaataa tha, uske raste alag-alag ho gaye
 The show that made Kapil popular across the country - due to illness, controversy, the channel had to take a decision to shut him down
 firangi ke saath daanv par hai do chijen - # 1
 Acting career: The success of Firangi is very important for Kapil's career as an actor
 isamen koi shaq nahin ki kapil kii apni lokapriyata he, lekin box offis hi tay karegaa ki unke prashansakon ne unhen tivi ke alaava film ke liye kitna pasand kiya? haalanki apni pehali film main unhone ise jamkar bhunaaya tha
 'kis Kis Ko Pyaar Karoon' was his first film in 2015 which was just 8
 5 karod main bani thi
 According to trade pundits, it had earned over 32 crores in the first week itself
 film main aisa kuch alag nahin tha
 Kapil's image was believed to benefit the film's business
 # 2
 Kapil is confident after two years of 'firangi'
 ek abhinayta ke taur par bhale hi kapil ne pehali film se joardaar vyavsaayik safalataa arjeet kii, lekin bollywood ne unki safalataa ko us andaaj main nahin liya
 As is usually seen after successful films by other actors
 unhen bade banners kii pikcharen ofer nahin huin
 When the industry did not pay attention to him even when the first film was a hit, then how bad his film career could prove to be, it was not difficult to understand
 firangi: in 5 vajahon ke liye jarur dekhni chahie kapil sharma kii film?in 4 vajahon se hit sabit hogi kapil kii film # 1
 Kapil's native is believed to be about Anajjakpil, that he taught the nation to laugh openly
 yah kaaphi had tak sahi he jo kapil ke sho kamedi nits or da kapil sharma sho kii lokapriyata se samajhi ja sakati he
 Behind this popularity of Kapil is his amazing witty and desi comic style
 unke zyaadaatar jokes dekhen to maaloom padataa he ki ye gramin or chote shaharon kii rosemara ke jivan se liye gaye hai
 # 2
 kapil kii fain foloingkapil ke audiyans main zyaadaatar middle class ke log hai
 Kapil brought out jokes from everyday life, which directly connected with the audience
 gramin kshetron or shahari nimna madhyavargeey samaaj main unki jabardast folowing he
 Most importantly, Kapil also has a deep influence among the youth
 iskaa saboot internet par unke sho se jude videos hai jinke vyuj lakhon karodon main hai
 Even today the youth entertains by watching footage of Kapil's shows on youtube
 prashansak ek lambey samay baad kapil ko dekhnaa jarur pasand karenge
 Fans started crying with Kapil Sharma, 'firangi' shared photo # 3
 puraa weekend khaali honakapil sharma kii firangi shuukravaar 1 disambar ke din relies ho rahi he
 Earlier, Sanjay Leela Bhansali's film Padmavati was scheduled to be released on this date
 padmavati badi film thi is vajah se kai nirmaataa-nirdeshkon ne uske aas-paas kii date par apni filmon ko relies karne main dilchaspee nahin dikhaai
 Padmavati's scheduled release came to a halt after being mired in controversies
 firangi pehle 24 november ko relies hone vaali thi ab padmavati kii date par aegi
 By the way, Sunny leone-arbaaz Khan starrer film 'tera Wait' is also being released on Friday
 lekin dekha jaae to yah waisi film nahin he jo kapil ko box offis par chunauti de sake

 kapil kii bebaakigutthi se jhagada or sharaab kii lat ke kaaran kapil sharma kii image negative bani
 However, after about three months when Kapil Sharma appeared in front of the media, he accepted the truth in the first meeting
 unhone na sirf sach sweekaara balki sharaab kii lat or avsaad ke bare main bhi baat kii
 He explained to the media how he had become addicted to alcohol
 lat ke kaaran avsaad main chale gaye the or logon se dur ho gaye the
 He tried to show that he was upset about the fact that he was constantly locked in the office room
 unhone apni is bebaaki se media main chal rahi kai afvaahon ko bhi kinare laga diya
 Nowadays, it is such a time that people like to listen directly to the artist's problem and express sympathy with him
 kapil kii is bebaaki se prashaskon ke bich unki chhavi or majboot hui he
 It is expected to benefit Firangi
 paanch rajyon main hue vidhansabha chunaav ke nateezon main bijepi ko jor kaa jhatka laga he
 The BJP lost government in three states, while in two other states the party could not do much
 ab centre or maharashtra main endie kii sahyogi dal shivasena hi bijepi ko katghare main khadaa kar rahi he
 Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray termed it a victory of humility over arrogance
 shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare ne saamana main apane sampadakeey main congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi kii vinamrata kii tarif kii he
 He has written that Rahul Gandhi has humbly accepted the victory and has expressed his gratitude to the Chief Ministers of BJP ruled states and announced that they will take their work forward
 lekin modi to pandit nehru, indira gandhi or rajeev gandhi ke yogadan ko maanane ko taiyaar nahin hai
 Even Advani, who created the BJP, is not acceptable to him
 uddhav ne aage likhaa ki aisa ahankaar sirf mahabharat main dikhaai diya tha, lekin uskaa bhi paraabhav hua
 Rahul Gandhi has humbly said that we will defeat BJP in 2019 also
 magar lekin bijepi mukt bharat kaa naaraa nahin denge
 Why did Gandhi survive even in such a storm and why democracy was not destroyed even after suffering so much wound? The answer lies in this humility
 bijepi ke congress mukt bharat ke naare par prahaar karte uddhav ne kaha- is jeet ne congress ko niraashaa kii gart se baahar nikaal diya he
 Rahul Gandhi becoming Congress President means fulfilling the dream of Congress dismissal by Mahatma Gandhi, then such remarks were made by veterans like modi-shah and even the children of bjp's street
 congress mukt bharat kaa naaraa dekar unka galaa suukh gaya or jo log congress ko shradhanjali arpit karte hue nahin thak rahe the, ve saare achaanak gunge-bahere ban gaye hai
 Let us tell you that the Congress party has returned to Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan in the assembly elections held in five states
 jeet ke baad congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne media ko sambodhit karte hue sabhi rajyon ke mukhyamantriyon dwaara rajya kii janata ke liye kiye gaye kaaryon ke liye aabhaar vyakt kiya
 Which is being praised all round

 Former US President Barack Obama, who visited India, has said that during his visit to India in 2015, he had personally spoken to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the issue of religious tolerance and religious freedom
 is par madhav ne kaha ki baraak ko piem modi ke saath hui ek sikret baat ko yun saarvajanik nahin karnaa chahie tha
 Let us tell you that Barakobamane said that during his visit to India in 2015, he had spoken alone to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the issue of religious tolerance and religious freedom
 unhone tab kaha tha ki dharmik aazaadee na hone se log ek duusare ke bich antar dekhne lagate hai or samanthaayen khatm ho jaati hai
 We need to pay attention to this
 madhav ne isi bayaan par sawaal uthaate hue kaha ki obama ko sochna chahie tha ki kya nijee baatcheet ko saarvajanik karnaa uchit he? obama ko vah nahin kahana chahie

 These controversies are fueled by incorrect debat shows on TV channels
 iske baad ram madhav ne media par deshvirohi vishyon yaa deshbhakti par sawaal uthaane vaale muddon ko hawa dene kaa aarope lagaaya
 Ram Madhav said that there should be an open debate on the issue related to nationalism
 vande maataram gaaya jaae yaa nahin is par open bahes ho
 Madhav said that when the media is prevented from arguing properly on these issues, then there should be protest, but the atmosphere is not there now
 madhav ne kaha ki ham free flo dibet chahie, bahes karne dijie, khulepan se bahes ho
 Speaking on the Left government, Ram Madhav said that the current situation in Kerala is worrisome
 yahi nahin ram madhav ne rahul par bhi tanj ksaa

e
 Thursday afternoon
 iske baad agle 48 ghante tak wo apane kamare main hi akeli raheen
 Did not leave even once
 kamare se baahar nikali to bas unki maut kii khabar
 This news was also given by a doctor
 hotel ke bathtub main shridevi ko behoshee kii alam main dekhne ke baad usee doctor ne sabase pehle bataaya ki unki maut ho chuki he
 Caused cardiac arrest lekin 48 ghante baad postmortem report maut kii vajah bathtub main doobana bataati he
 The police want to know whether this was a doctor's mistake or the story is something else? Know the two important things before reaching any conclusion about the reasons that led to the death of Sridevi
 pehali ye ki dubai police ne saaf kar diya he ki shridevi kii maut ek haadasa he koi saazish nahin
 And second is that even then his death will be investigated
 is bare main unke tamaam karibighon se poochtacha hogi
 Her husband Boney Kapoor has also been questioned by the Dubai Police on Sunday and Monday
 shridevi kii maut kii jaanch dubai police se lekar dubai public prosicution ko saunp di gai he
 Now let us know what happened at room number 2201 of Dubai's Jumeira Emirates Tower Hotel on Saturday, 24 February? Actually, Sridevi came to this hotel two days before she was in Rasal camp near Dubai
 vahaan unke pati boni kapur ke bhaanje kii shaadi thi
 After marriage, Boney Kapoor and his younger daughter returned to Mumbai
 jabaki shridevi dubai main ruk gayi
 Sridevi's sister also lives in Dubai
 hotel staff ke mutabik, shridevi 48 ghante tak hotel ke apane kamare se baahar nahin nikaleen thim, is dauraan wo lagaataar akeli thim, udhar boni kapur bharat lautne ke baad lakhanu chale gaye the, jahaan invester summit thi
 He returned to Mumbai and returned to Mumbai
 mumbai main unke ek dost shetty kaa janm din tha
 He then goes back to Dubai on 24 February with an afternoon flight
 unke dubai aane kii khabar shridevi ko nahin thi
 Late in the evening, they reach the hotel and surprise Sridevi
 is bich lagbhag usee vakt boni kapur ke bhai sanjay kapur dubai se mumbai laut rahe hote hai
 He too does not meet Sridevi
 ab hotel ke kamare ke andar kii do kahani he
 One story says that Boney Kapoor arrives at the hotel first
 shridevi se kuch der tak baat karte hai or phir shridevi ko baahar dinar par le jane ke liye taiyaar hone ko kehete hai
 After this, Sridevi goes to the bathroom
 magar jab pandrah minute tak darwaja nahin khulata to wo aawaaj dete hai
 If the door still does not open then they push and open the door
 shridevi andar bathtub main behosh padi thim
 After this, Boney Kapoor first calls one of his friends and then the police
 duusari kahani ye he ki jis vakt shridevi bathroom main gayi tab boni kapur hotel main hi nahin the
 Sridevi called the room service and asked for drinking water
 iske baad wo bathroom main chali gayi
 After some time, when the hotel staff brought water, when the door did not open even after ringing a lot, he himself came into the room
 iske baad main usne paaya ki shridevi bathtub main behosh padi hai
 After this, he first informed the hotel and then the police
 haalanki dubai police ne report de di he ki shridevi kii maut kii vajah pani main doobana he
 But this is not the last report
 is maamle kii jaanch kar rahi he dubai public prosicution kaa kahana he ki paanch chizon kii jaanch puri hone ke baad hi kisi nattejey par pahunchaa ja saktaa he
 The police want to know what happened in room number 2201 in the last moments? Did Sridevi take alcohol herself or did someone give it intentionally? How was the water filled with water in the bathtub? After seeing Sridevi unconscious in the bathtub, why did Boney Kapoor first call his friend instead of calling the police or hotel staff? However, the Dubai Police is describing the death of Sridevi as an accident

 Four Haryana bureaucrats have given a clean chit to Congress President Sonia Gandhi's son-in-law, Robert Vadra, in the land purchase case, saying there was no wrongdoing in the deals

 unase is baat kii bhi jaanch karne ke liye kaha gaya tha ki stamp shulk se bachane ke liye kahin bhoomi kii kam keemat to nahin aanki gai thi
 Khemka was the Director General of Land Reinforcement and Land Records at that time and sought an inquiry report by 25 October
 bhupinder singh hooda sarkaar ne 11 oktober ko khemka ko mahanideshak pad se hataa diya tha
 Although the Hooda government called it a regular transfer, it is well known that Khemka was transferred because he started an investigation on October 8 against Vadra's land deals
 aadhikarik sutron ne kaha he ki wadra ne paardarshee tareeke se jameen kharidi thi or prayek jile main tatkaaleen colector dar ke anuroop stamp shulk kaa bhugtan kiya gaya tha
 a revenue official said, 'in some cases Vadra actually paid a stamp duty in excess of the value that falls under the collector rate
 'upayuktaon kii rapat ke bare main jab khemka se poocha gaya to unhone kaha, 'maine bhoomi saudon or stamp shulk bhugtan ke sambandh main upayuktaon se rapat maangi thi
 i am no longer in that position, so i have nothing to say on this
 'khemka ne 15 oktober ko wadra kii company, ski lite hospitality or dlef ke bich 58 karod rupee keemat ke ek pramukh bhukhand kaa qaraar bhi radd kar diya tha
 Vadra and his companies had purchased land since 2005 in the districts of Gurgaon, Palwal, Mewat and Faridabad
 in jilon main wadra ne kul 170 acre jameen kharidi thi
 The United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government came to power at the Center in 2004, while the Hooda government has been in power in Haryana since March 2005

 Since ancient times, every day along with the temple darshan is worshiped daily
 mandir main paath, puja-aarti, mantra jaap aadi shaamil hota he

 The beads in the rosary are called bead
 saamanytah maala main 108 manake hote hai parantu kabhi kabhi isamen 27 athwa 54 manake bhi hote hai
 Therefore, we should bow our head and greet us at the temple during the time of darshan of God and must keep in mind the following things while chanting the mantra
 yadi paramatma ke samaksh baithkar jaap karnaa ho to nimna dhang se karen -jameen par shuddh oonee asana bichhaakar baithen
 Sit Padmasana or Sukhasana (applying palathi)
 qamar se jhuken nahin
 Keep face also straight
 maala daahine haath kii ungaliyon par anguuthe ke por se pheren
 Be careful not to touch the nail with the garland
 plastic kii maala na pheren
 Do not peep around while turning the garland
 maala naabhi se neeche nahin, naak ke upar nahin jaani chahie evam seene se 4 angul dur saamne rakhen
 While reciting, keep the eyes in front of the divine or between the two eyebrows, or on the nose, or close your eyes
 jaap karte samay maala neeche na giraaen
 Do not place it on the ground, keep it on the pedestal or in the box

 In 24 years of international career he did not do the same thing and that is wicketkeeping
 international cricket main tendulkar kabhi wicket ke peeche dastaane pahane najar nahin aae, lekin bachapan main ek baar unhone keeping main bhi haath aajamaaya tha or iskaa baari khamiyaja bhi bhugta tha
 Tendulkar has mentioned this in his autobiography 'playing it my way'
 tendulkar ne shivaji park main khele gaye ek match kaa zikr karte hue 'plaing it maai ve' main likhaa, 'bachapan main meri jindagi adventure se bhari hui thi
 Once i was playing cricket in Shivaji Park
 us samay meri umr 12 varsh thi
 i was the captain of my team, my team's wicketkeeper got hurt
 maine apane saathi khilaadiyon se poocha ki kya koi wicketcaping kar saktaa he
 Nobody agreed but in the end i myself went to wicketkeeping
 'sachin ke mutabik, 'main wicketcaping karne main sahaj nahin tha or isi dauraan ek ball miss hui or meri ore teji se ai
 She started on my face before i could react anything
 is ghatana main meri aankh bal bal bachi thi
 The ball hurt me deeply and started bleeding
 'unhone aage likhaa, 'mere paas itane paise nahin the ki main taxi lekar ghar jaataa or lahooluhaan chehre ke saath bas main baithkar jane main bhi mujhe shame aa rahi thi
 i asked for a bicycle lift from a friend of mine
 cricket kit ke saath mujhe le janaa uske liye aasaan kaam nahin tha
 There is a flyover between East and West Bandra
 jahaan wo mujhe lekar cycle nahin chadha paaya
 After getting down there, i started walking and people started looking at me with surprise
 'sachin ke anusaar, 'jab main ghar pahunchaa to yah dekhakar tasalli mili ki mere mata-pita ghar par nahin the
 There was a grandmother at home and i told her not to tell anyone at home that there is a small injury
 unhone mujhase kaha ki mujhe pataa he ki is tarah kii chot se kaise nipatate hai
 They put hot turmeric on my injury
 daadi ke is nuskhe se meri chot jaldi se thik ho gai thi
 ' ithiopia main ravivaar ko bheeshan vimaan durghatana ke baad bowing ke 737 MAX par sawaal khadey kiye jane lage hai
 Several countries in the world, including India, have banned the use of Boeing's 737 MAX aircraft
 lekin america ne abhi is par roak nahin lagaai he, isko lekar raashtrapati trump kii aalochana bhi kii ja rahi he
 The American Boeing Company still maintains that its aircraft is completely safe
 MAX par phir uthi ungaligauratlab he ki ithiopia airlines kii flite iti 302 addis ababa ke dakshin-purv main bishoftu ke paas mangalvaar ko durghatnagrast ho gai thi jisamen 157 log maare gaye the
 It was a Boeing 737 MAX aircraft
 kareeb paanch maah pehle indonesia main bhi ek 737 MAX vimaan durghatnagrast ho gaya tha jisamen 189 log maare gaye the
 This then led to questions over Boeing's 737 MAX
 iske baad bharat sahit switzraland, mexico, australia, britain, china, south africa, kuwait ne is vimaan ke istemaal par roak laga di he
 The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) in India has decided to remove Boeing-737 MAX aircraft from immediate flights
 europea union aviation sefti agency ne bhi bowing 737-8 or 737-9 kii sabhi udaanon ko nilambit kar diya he
 But the American Aviation Regulator said that they would not remove these aircraft because there was no issue regarding the performance of the aircraft in the investigation they conducted
 bowing ne bhi kaha he ki use apane vimaan par puraa bharosa he
 In India, the maximum impact of this ban will be on Spice Jet, which has 12 such aircraft in its fleet
 isse hawaii kiraaya badhane kii bhi ashanka he
 Earlier Boeing's old 737 aircraft was considered to be one of the most prestigious aircraft in the industry
 lekin saal 2017 main bowing ne nayaa maiks 8 vimaan launch kiya jisase eendhan istemaal ke hisaab se ab tak kaa sabase kifayati vimaan mana jaataa he
 So far, the company has sold 350 such aircraft
 america main roak nahinaisa kaha ja rahaa he ki america raashtrapati trump prashasan se bowing company se kareebi rishte hai
 That is why he is not prohibiting the use of Boeing 737 MAX aircraft in the US
 samachar agency riters ke anusaar, america raashtrapati khud kabhi airlines ke maalik rah chuke hai
 He ran an aviation company under the name of Trump Shuttle from 1989 to 1992 before becoming President
 unke paas apana nijee jet vimaan bhi tha
 US officials have repeatedly stated that the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft will not be removed
 paanch seenetter ke ek group or kai america adhikariyon ne yah sawaal uthaaya he ki aakhir america aviation agency baaki deshon kii tarah kadam kyon nahin uthaa rahi
 Critics say the relationship between Boeing and the Trump administration is strong
 trump bowing ke vimaanon kaa istemaal karte rahe hai
 He has made several important announcements about the US while traveling in Boeing planes
 america ke kaaryvahak raksha mantri patric shanahan pentagon main aane se pehle 31 saal pehle bowing ke liye kaam kar chuke hai
 Boeing also nominated Nikki Haley to join its board of directors, who has been a US ambassador to the United Nations

 Rajasthan BJP has introduced a new document in response to the allegations of Congress leader Jairam Ramesh
 jairam ramesh ke aaropon ke baad rajasthan bijepi adhyaksh ashok paranami ne press conference main 1965 kaa ek dastavej pesh kiya jiske mutabik bharat sarkaar ne dhaulpur house maharaja hemanth singh ke naam kar diya tha
 Ashok Parnami said, 'in front of this 1965 document, where does the 1949 Kavik document that Jairam Ramesh was showing
 ' bijepi netaa rajendra rathod ne is maamle main jairam ramesh ko bahes karne kii chunauti di
 He said that the Congress is showing piecemeal documents in this case which defame
 unhone kaha ki agar vah galat nikle to istipha dene ko taiyaar hai
 Jairam showed the old document? Ashok Parnami said that Jairam showed the record of 1949, while in December 1956, the government recognized Hemant Singh as the king
 22 november 1958 ko dhaulpur pales ke badale kaisarbagh pales kii adla-badali hui thi
 In 2010, there were Congress governments at both the Center and the state and the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) compensated Dushyant
 2013 main congress ne kaha ki do logon ne maamle kii sibiai jaanch kii maang kii he tab bhi congress centre main thi
 The BJP leader said, 'we are ready for a CBI inquiry
 'jairam ramesh ne lagaaya he aaropagauratlab he ki congress netaa jairam naresh ne mangalvaar ko press conference karkekuch dastavej pesh kiye theore unke hawaale se daawa kiya tha ki dhaulpur mahal rajasthan sarkaar kii sampatti he
 He said, 'dushyant Singh took a compensation of just Rs 2 crore in lieu of that palace
 yah number van ghotaalaa he
 It should be investigated
 'ramesh ne kaha ki kai saare saboot hone ke baad bhi bijpi us mahal par dushyant ke malikana haq ko sabit karne kii koshish kar rahi he
 According to the agreement between the Government of India and the Raja of Dholpur in 1949, as long as the king is alive, he can stay in it and for this he will have to pay the government
 yani is sampatti par vasundhara raaje ke parivaar kaa haq nahin banataa

 sansad par hamale kii 11 veen barsi par bhaajapa netaaon ne rajyasabha main maang kii ki hamale ke mukhya shadyantrkaari afjal guru ko faansee dene ke bare main sarkaar apana rukh spasht kare
 In Zero Hour, m Venkaiah Naidu of BJP said that the 11th anniversary of the attack on Parliament
 is hamale main hamaare suraksha karmiyon or logon kii jaan gai thi
 He said that Afzal Guru was convicted and sentenced to death in the attack, which was confirmed by the Supreme Court
 naidu ne kaha ki grih mantralay ko desh ko yah bataanaa chahie ki vah ucchtam nyaayalay ke aadesh par kya karrwai karne ja rahaa he
 On this, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Kamal Nath said that he will convey the feelings of the House to the Home Minister in this matter
 unhone kaha ‘main grih mantri se anurodh karuunga ki vah is bare main sarkaar dwaara uthaae gaye kadamon se sadan ko avgat karaaen
 Earlier, on the commencement of the sitting of the House, a tribute was paid to security personnel and people who lost their lives during the terrorist attack on Parliament on 13 December 2001
 rajasthan main vakeelon kii hadtaal ko do maah ho gaye
 Clearly, the judicial system has collapsed here
 muvakkilon kii lagaataar upeksha or nyaayadhishon ke khilaaf koi khaas bhrashtachar saamne laa paane main vakeelon kii naakaami ne unke peshey ko badnaam kiya he
 The High Court has also dragged the government into a dispute over lawyers and judges, making the situation even more dramatic
 isse pehle ki supreme court main yah maamla dobaaraa aae, varisht vakil ram jethmalani ne madhyasthata kii peshkash kii he
 Despite negotiations, appeals and pressure, the Rajasthan High Court has failed to break this impasse
 is hadtaal kii shuruyaat us vakt hui jab kuch vakeelon ko laga ki ek jaj ne ek vakil ke khilaaf kiraye kaa flats khaali karne kaa aadesh galat tareeke se diya
 These lawyers also include the president of the Bar Association
 aakhirkaar ukt vakil ko vah cameraa khaali karnaa padaa he lekin baaki vakil do jajon ke tabadale kii maang ko lekar hadtaal par hai
 When the High Court ordered the government lawyers to either return to work or be ready to cancel their licenses, ten additional general counsel resigned
 iske ek din pehle hi hycourt kii jodhpur khandpeeth ke nyaayadhish govind maathur ne mahadhivaktaaon ko kaha tha ki yaa to kaam par aana shuru karen yaa ve unke license radd kar denge
 On the other hand, Judge Ajay Rastogi and J
J
 ke
 Ranka summoned the Chief Secretary and asked if the striking government lawyers were getting their salaries and why the government was defending them? The outcome of this High Court strategy is yet to be seen
 lekin hadataali vakeelon main sarkari vakeelon kii sankhya kaaphi kam he or ve apni baar associationon ke khilaaf nahin jaaenge
 The government also has the option of withholding their salary on the direction of the court
 sarkaar ne pehle hi aise sarkari vakeelon kii niyukti kii prakriya shuru kar di he jo hadtaal main shaamil na hon
 But it is unlikely to be effective
 hycourt ne is maamle main baar council ko ab tak shaamil nahin kiya he
 Conditions within the courts are strange
 haal hi main kuch jaj kaidiyon ko jamaanat dilwane ke liye jail gaye
 Many lawyers tell their clients how to put their case in court so that the case is not dismissed in their absence
 kuch vakil aisa ni:shulk karte hai jabaki zyada shulk lene ke maamle bhi saamne aae hai
 In recent years, the High Court has given similar nominal decisions because the cases that come to it are less related to law, more related to personal relief
 saaf he ki nyaayik vyavastha main vidhik vivek kaa koi nirmaan nahin ho rahaa he
 At the same time, bar associations have insistent arguments or go on strike
 ab is bahaane in associationon ke chunaavon par bhi najar daalane kii jarurat he
 The lawyers probably have no idea that their commitment to justice is being questioned
 supreme court ne bhi is ore ishaara kiya he ki ahan kii yah ladaai vakil birdari kaa nuksaan kar rahi he
 On the other hand, the judges will also have to see for themselves why so many lawyers are against them? Some lawyers told India Today that through them judges take bribes but none of the lawyers openly say which judge or court staff had paid any bribe
 ve nijee bhrashtachar ke chhitput maamle bataa pate hai
 In such a situation, the question arises that if a lawyer has bribed the judge to take a decision in his favor, then the lawyers themselves have also contributed to corrupt this system
 ab sthiti yah he ki court ne kadaa rukh dikhaate hue sarkari vakeelon ke khilaaf karrwai kii maang kii he
 What will lawyers do now? Will they demand the transfer of every judge who will take a strong judicial stand against them? The government has also been pulled into this issue
 vahiin is hadtaal ke khatm hone kaa koi rasta nahin sujh rahaa
 The best solution can be that the lawyers end their strike and get their complaints lodged before the court through their good lawyers

 When the BJP was going to hold a contemplation meeting in Shimla after a second consecutive defeat in general elections 2009, Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat had exhorted the party, "the need to hand over the command of BJP to the younger generation is
 yah saarvbhaumik satya he ki yuva peedi puraani peedi kii jagah leti he or yah bijepi ko tay karnaa he ki kya badlaav agali peedi tak pratiksha kar saktaa he?" unhone ausat aayu ke netritv kii vakaalat karte hue 55 se 60 saal tak kii seemaa tay kii thi
 The impact of this strategy was reflected on organizations like the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, including the sangh-bjp, but the Sangh itself withdrew from this edict in an important meeting of the All India Representative Assembly, the highest policy-making body to be held in Nagpur in three years
 sangh kii 'saadhy nitidarasal yuva peedi ko tarjeeh nahin dekar sangh ne modi sarkaar ko saadhane kii koshish kii he
 Sarkaryavah post is of the 'executive' in the union and there was a strong discussion that Sah Sarkaryavah Dattatreya Hosabale will be made Sarkaryavah this time
 lekin sarasanghachaalak mohan bhagwat ne yuva chehre kii jagah sarkarywah pad ke liye lagaataar teesri baar bhaiyyaji joshi kii niyukti kar modi sarkaar se apane sameekaran ke spasht sanket de die
 According to a senior Sangh leader, "the Sangh is a maternal organization and a change in Sarkaryavah post could have weakened the Sangh's standing in front of the Modi government
 " umr or varishthata ke lihaaj se sangh kii is 'saadhy niti kaa khaas mahatv he
 Dattatre 'hosabale is 59 years old and is considered very close to Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 agar unhen sarkarywah banaaya jaataa to varishthata ke lihaaj se modi ke mukaable ve junior hote
 The top leaders of the Sangh thought that this change would allow Modi to dominate the Sangh and end his elder brother's role
 isliye sangh ke kattar modi virdohi dhade ne hosbale kii bajaae 67 varshiya bhaiyyaji ko tarjeeh di jo umr main sangh pramukh bhagwat se bhi do saal bade hai
 However, it was argued that Bhaiyyaji has done a better job for the expansion of the Sangh in 6 years and the Sangh played an important role in the Lok Sabha elections too, so the general should not be changed immediately by winning the battle
 dilachasp baat yah rahi ki is tarah kaa bayaan hosbale kii ore se pratinidhi sabha kii baithak se thik pehle dilvaaya gaya
 Before the meeting, Hosabale's name was in the news for the post of Sarkaryavah and according to sources, Bhagwat himself also expressed surprise at such reports of media changes
 sangh kii aapasi khinchataan us vakt bhi ujagar ho gai, jab pratinidhi sabha kii baithak ke baad bhaiyyaji media se rou-ba-rou hue
 He avoided the questions asked about Hosabale, while avoiding giving credit to Modi for the change in the center
 bhaiyyaji ne loksabhaa main bijepi kii badi jeet par kaha, "janata parivartan chaahati thi isliye centre main parivartan hua
 "but when asked whether the Sangh considers it a Modi victory or not, the All India publicity chief Manmohan Vaidya, who was present with Bhaiyyaji, was uprooted on the question, who could not become a co-government because of the Sangh's mutual tussle
" ek mandir, ek kuan, ek shmashansangh pramukh ne pratinidhi sabha main saaf taur se sandesh diya ki sanghathan ke vistaar ke liye yah sabase anukool samay he or agle teen saal tak vishesh janajagran abhiyaan chalaane kii jarurat he
 Certainly, the Sangh wants to take advantage of the BJP government at the Center for its expansion
 lekin sangh ko desh bhar se mili feedback se sandesh niklaa he ki jatiyon main jakadaaa samaaj uske vistaar main aade aa rahaa he
 In this meeting, surveys conducted in some states like Jharkhand, Andhra Pradesh were also put in it, which was an assessment of how the caste-system is hindering the expansion of the Union
 iske liye sangh ne ek bada agenda saamne rakhaa he, jisaki neenv vishwa hindu parishad ke swarna jayanti samaaroh ke udghaatan samaaroh ke dauraan mumbai main viechpi ke antarrashtriya kaaryakari adhyaksh praveen togdipha ne rakhi thi
 Togadia had prepared a presentation titled Vision-2025 and placed it in front of Bhagwat
 isaki copy india today ke paas maujuud he
 In this, all Hindus are advised to make a Hindu family friend in another caste other than their caste, eat together, celebrate the festival and also go on a tour together
 togdipha ne apane prajentation main kaha he ki ek gaanv main pani ke liye sabhi hinduon kaa ek kuan ho, ek mandir ho or ek shmashaan ho
 The House of Representatives has accepted this vision-2025 and has a long-term plan to expand the organization
 itnaa hi nahin, sangh kii yojana ke mutabik mandiron ko ab ek chhatari ke tahat laane kii khaas ranneeti banaai gai he or yah jimmaa vishwa hindu parishad ko saunpa gaya he taaki hindu samaaj ko ekajute rakhaa ja sake
 But generally the brahmin-banias dominate the top body of the Sangh and this organization has been seen from this perspective only
 lekin sambhavatya yah pehla mauka he jab sangh ne anya pichde varg (obisi) se aane vaale 65 varshiya ve
 Bhagayya has been made the associate government
 is niyukti se sangh ne saaf sandesh diya he ki uskaa abhiyaan jaat-paant se pare he or vah naaraa buland kar rahaa he—ab jati chodo, hindu bano
 With this the aim of the Sangh is to increase the number of branches
 haalanki pratinidhi sabha kii baithak main sarkarywah kii ore se rakhi gai report main sangh kaa daawa he ki pichley teen saal main shakhaon kii sankhya 10, 413 badi he or ab kul 55, 010 sthanon tak vah pahunch chuki he
 In 2015-16 on the birth centenary year of the third Sarsanghchalak of the Sangh, Balasaheb Deoras, the Sangh has announced to run special programs of social harmony in 50 thousand places in the country
 haalanki baithak main swayamsevakon kii ore se sangh main pravaktaa pad ko phir se behaal karne kii bhi maang uthi
 The reasoning behind this was that the way social media and other mediums have also increased influence, new issues are coming up and at times, there is confusion among volunteers
 isliye sangh kaa rukh spasht karne ke liye aadhikarik pravaktaa hona chahie
 Bhagwat gave assurance of rethinking in this regard to 1,400 delegates from across the country
 upi-bihar main kamjor bijepisang kii is baithak main swayamsevakon kii ore se jammu-kashmir main algaavvaadiyon kii rihaai ke masale par sawaal uthaaya gaya ki jamini str par logon ko samajhaana mushkil ho rahaa he
 According to the sources, the Sangh chief clearly stated that the issue of Article 370 has been a deathblow for the Sangh and no agreement will be made with it
 sutron ke mutabik, bhagwat ne yahaan tak kah diya, "agar sarkaar vichaardhaara se bhatak rahi he to sangh ko use raste par laana acchhee tarah se aata he
 "the Sangh gave a clear suggestion to the BJP in this meeting to take a lesson from Delhi and correct the situation in bihar-uttar Pradesh
 sutron ke mutabik, sangh ne bijepi ke saath bihar-upi ko lekar prachaarkon kii ore se mili jamini report ko saajha karte hue bataaya he ki bihar main philhal party duusare number par jaati dikh rahi he to upi main tisare number par
 But the Sangh chief has also cracked down on statements provoking religious sentiments of leaders associated with the sangh-vhp
 kattar bayaan dene vaale aanushanbik sanghathanon ko saaf taur se kaha gaya he ki badbola bayaan dene kii bajaae ve apane daayre main rahakar jameen par kaam karen
 The Sangh has realized that the Ram temple issue no longer works
 isliye pratinidhi sabha main manthan ke baad sarkarywah bhaiyyaji ne kaha, "ram mandir jald bane, lekin yah maamla supreme court ke samaksh he, isliye is mudde par kisi andolan kii jarurat nahin he
 "certainly it is a relief for the Modi government because many leaders of the Sangh's allied organizations on the temple issue have been talking about the construction of Ram temple in the first term of the 2019 government
 jaahir taur par sangh ne modi sarkaar ko raahat de di he
 But the Sangh realizes that after the big victory under the leadership of Modi in the Lok Sabha elections and after Modi's special Amit Shah became the national president, now instead of just co-government, a team should be formed to coordinate with the BJP and Bhaiyyaji Joshi led it
 Do it sangh main sheersh str par koi bada badlaav nahin hone se yah spasht ho gaya he ki kam-se-kam aane vaale teen saal tak sangh hi modi sarkaar par haaavee rahane vaala he

 PM will also address a rally in Mirzapur
 mana ja rahaa he ki is raily ke jariye modi patel samudaay or sahyogi apana dal ko saadhenge
 This week, BJP President Amit Shah visited Mirzapur
 azamgarh main nahin khilaa tha kamalbata den pichley dinon sant kabir nagar ke magahar main piem modi kii jansabha hui thi
 During this time Modi attacked all opposition parties including SP and BSP
 mana ja rahaa he ki is hamale ko azamgarh main ve or aakraamakata de sakate hai
 Azamgarh was the only seat in Purvanchal in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, where the BJP could not win
 itnaa hi nahin 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav main azamgarh kii 10 siton main se mahaj ek bijepi jeet saki thi
 While five sps and 4 bsps were awarded
 piem modi ke daure se pehle bijepi adhyaksh amit shah bhi purvanchal ko saadhane ke liye pahunche the
 Shah had started to weave Mission-2019's Tanabana from Vindhyachal Dham in Purvanchal
 shah ne avadh, kaashi or gorakhpur praant ke 30 loksabhaa kshetra ke prabhariyon ke saath baithak kar jamini str par sanghathan va janata kii nabj ko samajhane kii koshish kii thi
 The bypoll of the BJP in the by-election is that the opposition parties are coming together in UP to prevent Modi from coming to power
 purvanchal ke gorakhpur or phulpur loksabhaa upachunaav main sapa-basapa kii ekta se bijepi chaaron khaane chit ho gai thi
 After this, the opposition's strength of unity was also seen in Kairana in western UP, where RLD defeated BJP
 upachunaav main mili jeet ke formule se utsahit sapa, basapa or congress 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main mahagathbandhan banaakar utarane kaa man bana rahe hai
 The churning continues with the seat sharing between the three parties
 mana ja rahaa he ki mahagathbandhan ke sahyogiyon ke bich siton kaa talmail bahut kuch tak 2009 par aadhaarit hoga, kyonki 2014 main to vipaksh puri tarah se dharaashai ho gaya tha
 If the formula of seats in the Grand Alliance 2009 is made the basis, then there will be fierce tussle between the three parties, because if the results of the 2009 seats of Purvanchal region are considered, then there is not much difference between the three parties
 aankade bataate hai ki tab 21 main se sarvaadhik aath seat basapa ko, 7 sapa or 6 seat congress ko mili thim
 While speaking of 2014, only SP got one seat, that too when Mulayam Singh himself came out of Azamgarh
 aise main ab dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki congress, sapa or basapa ke bich siton kaa talmail kaise hota he, kise kitni siten milti hai
 BJP sweats out of the Grand Alliance If the opposition comes out in 2019 by forming the Grand Alliance, it will not be easy for the BJP to repeat the results like 2014
 varanasi jaisi seat chhod den to purvanchal kii zyaadaatar siten bijepi ke haathon se nikal jaaengi
 If the Purvanchal slips from the hands of BJP then it will be difficult to reach the power of the country
 upi ke badale siyaasi mizaaj ke tahat bijepi ke liye purvanchal ko sadhana kaaphi ahm ho gaya he
 Perhaps this is the reason why PM Modi and Amit Shah are focusing more on Eastern Uttar Pradesh than Western Uttar Pradesh
 bijepi kii pradesh ikai purvanchal ke kai jilon main modi kii reliyaan karakar maahaul ko apane paksh main banane kii koshish main jute gai hai

 ek saath kai survey aae hai jisamen endie kii prachand jeet kaa akalan kiya gaya he
 In the survey of Aaj Tak- Axis My India, NDA has been given a maximum of 365 seats
 aise main yah jaananaa jaruri he ki wo koun se mudde rahe jisase narendra modi or endie ke paksh main hawa banati dikh rahi he
 1-nationalismbjp is a champion of staunch nationalism
 vipakshi dal jis mudde ko 'soft corner' apanaate dikhte hai, bijepi use apana agenda maanati rahi he
 Talking about the leaders of BJP, Narendra Modi is considered as an eloquent speaker of this issue because in his statements and speeches there is more emphasis on that first nation and later party or family
 unhone apane bhaashanon main rashtrawaad ko sarvocch rakhaa
 2- The security of national security be it from internal threat or from external challenges, Narendra Modi has been saying that his government has made India safe on both fronts
 is baat ko unhone apane chunavi bhaashanon main bhi shaamil kiya or jahaan jahaan reliyaan kin, vahaan is par jor diya
 On the issue of internal danger, he claimed to curb Naxalism and extremism
 unke mutabik 'red coridor' ko unhone green coridor main badalane kaa kaam kiya he
 He has been talking of bringing anti-social elements who have taken the path of violence into mainstream politics
 3-aatankwadatankwaad kaa naam aate hi pakistan kaa naam aata he
 According to Narendra Modi, he isolated Pakistan on every front and conveyed to him that both talks and terrorism are not together
 haalanki pakistan is apil se prabhavit nahin hua or uske aatanki karname badastoor jari rahe
 As the Prime Minister has been speaking in his speeches that India has taken this issue to many countries of the world, he has expressed to them that Pakistan is not only a threat to the peace of South Asia but the world as a whole is on its violent radar
 4-hindutvahindutv kaa mudda bhi rashtrawaad kii tarah he jiske prati anya partiyaan 'soft approach' apanaati dikhti hai lekin bijepi is par mukhar rahi he
 Then there has been talk of Ram Mandir and Uniform Civil Code
 haalanki narendra modi is mudde par khulkar bolne se bachate rahe hai lekin varanasi main kaashi vishwanath mandir or haal main kedarnath-badrinath main vidhivat puja paath kaa unka sanskaar yah darshata he ki jis mudde ko anya partiyaan chunavi sijan main akhriyaar karti hai, us mudde par bijepi kaaphi aage nikal chuki he
 5-cleanliness Campaign If any issue was raised most in this election, it is cleanliness campaign
 pradhanmantri ne har bhaashanon main iskaa zikr kiya or bataaya ki unki sarkaar kaise baaki sarkaron se alag he
 He told that the effect of dirt and turbidity does not affect us, not only in the neighborhood but also in the world it tarnishes the image
 iske liye unhone khule main shouch se mukt bharat banane kaa vaada kiya
 Toilets were constructed for this and as the Prime Minister in his speeches claim to make this campaign 100 percent successful, it can be said that this issue can play a major role in his victory
 6-ayushmaan bharat yojanabijepi or narendra modi is yojana ko ek nai kranti bataate hai
 They believe that this is the world's largest health security plan
 unke bhaashanon main yah suna jaataa he ki garibon ke liye yah aisi adbhut yojana he jisase desh ke karodon parivaar labhanvit ho rahe hai or bhavishya main honge
 The Prime Minister Jan Arogya Yojana (AB-PMJAY) under Ayushman Bharat was launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Ranchi, the capital of Jharkhand
 sarkaar kaa daawa he ki ayushmaan bharat duniya kii pehali aisi yojana he, jiske antargat 50 karod se adhik logon ko paanch lakh rupye tak kaa beemaa milegaa
 There is talk of benefiting 40 percent of the lower middle class population
 7-ujjwala yojanayah yojana narendra modi sarkaar kii kai mahatvakankshi yojanaon main ek he
 Under this, there is a provision to provide free LPG connection to poor families
 pehle khaanaa banane ke liye lakdi, gobar ke upale aadi kii vyavastha main kadi mashkkat kerani padati thi, jisase bahut adhik samay or mehnat lagati thi
 The smoke emanating from the wood and the dunes affected the health of the whole family
 ab garib pariwaron ko gas chulhaa mil jane se bacchon ke manapsand kaa khaanaa or vyanjan jaldi ban jate hai
 Health is also taken care of
 is tarah kii baaten kai mahilaon ne pradhanmantri ke man kii baat kaarykram main uthaai hai
 8- Corruption was the biggest issue for BJP and Narendra Modi
 narendra modi hameshaa kehete rahe ki purv kii sarkaron se unki sarkaar bhinn rahi kyonki kisi bhi mantri yaa netaa par ratti bhar aniyamitata kaa aarope nahin laga
 Narendra Modi in his speeches mentions many corruption of the Congress, ranging from Bofors, 2G to the Commonwealth Scam
 chunaav prachaar ke ant main unhone purv pradhanmantri rajeev gandhi ko 'bhrashtachari number-1' tak kah diya jis par kaaphi hangaamaa hua
 However, the Congress raised the issue of Rafale deal in response to Bofors and presented it as the main point of its campaign
 rahul gandhi ne 'chaukeedaar chor he' kaa naaraa diya or isi ke ird gird ve narendra modi sarkaar ko 'bhrasht' bataate rahe
 Rahul Gandhi's 'chowkidar' was taken as an opportunity by Narendra Modi and in response he launched the 'main Bhi Hoon Chowkidar' campaign
 bijepi ke mutabik yah abhiyaan kaamyaab rahaa jiskaa phayda voton ke rup main use mila
 9-'mominal leader 'prime Minister Narendra Modi was heard in his speeches referring to' great leaders'
 unhone bataaya ki centre se bijepi sarkaar ko hataane or narendra modi ko haraane ke liye vipakshi netaa ek ho gaye hai
 About them, he said that the leaders who used to curse each other, have now become one to defeat them
 pradhanmantri modi ne kaha ki jin netaaon par bhrashtachar ke aarope hai, jo vanshavaad ko badhaava dete rahe hai, jo jamaanat par hai, jo kisi bhi surat main satta paanaa chaahate hai, ve sabhi netaa unhen haraane ke liye ek ho gaye hai
 According to the Prime Minister, there is complete opposition on one side and Modi alone on the other side
 10-sushasanpradhanmantri narendra modi ne sushasan kaa naaraa diya
 As the Prime Minister said in Khargone on 17 May, i am happy that the people of the country are carrying on the inspiration of patriotism, the philosophy of Antyodaya and the mantra of good governance and expressing their faith in the BJP
 aatankwaad or naksalwad ko khatm karne kii patibaddhta ko janata kaa bharpoor samarthan mil rahaa he
 The feeling of the country is that terrorists should enter the house and be killed
 sushasan ke mudde ko pradhanmantri ne atal bihari vaajapeyi ke janmdin se joda or 25 disbanr ko sushasan diwas manaane kii ravaayat shuru kii
 Every year on 25 December, this day is celebrated all over India

 aise main sawaal uthta he ki kya vah jamaat-ud-daawa, lashkar-e-taiyaba ke kaaran utpann ho rahi samasyaon se sachmuch nipatane kii koshish karenge yaa phir vah apni 1990 ke dashak kii us chhavi se dur honge, jab unhone parmaanu pareekshan kar daalaa tha

 bollywood abhinetri or anil kapur kii beti sonam kapur, dilli ke kaarobaari anand ahuja ke saath 8 may ko shaadi kar rahi hai
 This will be the second time in the last six months when a Bollywood actress is getting married in the peak of her career
 disambar 2017 main anoushka sharma ne cricketer viraat kohli ke saath dhoomdhaam se shaadi kii thi
 Deepika Padukone can also marry by the end of the year after dating Ranveer Singh for a long time
 teenon abhinetriyon kii umr 30 se 32 saal ke bich he
 Initially, two-three heroines decided to get married at the height of fame in Glamor World and continue to do films
 milinium year se thik ek saal pehle kaajol ne jo nai parampara shuru kii thi, 2012 main karina kapur khan kii shaadi ke baad bollywood main ye badlaav majboot hota najar aa rahaa he
 Relationship or live in is now a common practice for Bollywood
 ye badlaav isliye dilachasp he kyonki 2000 se pehle aisa dikhaai nahin padataa tha
 Far from marriage, actresses used to hide till their affair
 senior film critic ajay brahmatmaj kehete hai, iske kai kaaran the
 Dhrere's films and audiences take their archaic views
 pehle shaadi yaa 40 kii umr paar karne ke baad heroinon ko filmon main kendriya bhoomika ke laayak nahin mana jaataa tha
 Then their parts were mother, sister or other character roles
 bollywood main acchhee abhinetriyon kii sankhya bahut zyada he jinhen shaadi ke baad filmein chhodana padaa
 Kapoor Family Announcement - Sonam Kapoor's wedding will be on May 8, says film critic and trade analyst Komal Nahata, in those times (before 2000) used to make action, family drama or romantic films
 yahaan heroine zyaadaatar sho pis bhar thim
 Then there was also the thought that viewers would not like to see married heroines in films
 lekin ab aisa nahin he
 The effect of changes in the society is also visible in films
 ab heroinon kii umr yaa unki shaadishuda jindagi koi tabu nahin he
 According to Komal, in the last two decades, the way working women have emerged in the society, films have also been affected
 logon kii soch badali he
 It was once a trend, but now it is not an issue
 ajay is badlaav ke peeche pichley 17-18 saalon main heroinon ke filmi kirdaar main aae vajan ko bhi dekhte hai
 According to him, the film stories after 2000 have become stronger
 glamer kii jagah filmi kirdaar zyada ahm hue hai
 The actresses have also come to the center of the plot
 khaas baat yah he ki ab darshakon kaa samooh bhi badla he
 In the eyes of Komal - now the audience has a much larger range
 vah sirf ection yaa hero-heroin ke romance vaali kahaniyaan bhar nahin dekhnaa chahta he
 Due to this changed trend, action and family drama has become less in the last few years
 ab har kism kii filmein ban rahi hai
 Because the audience wants to see all kinds of, but good movies
 isi trend se mahilaon ke filmi kirdaar ko pramukhataa mili he
 In the films that are coming now, the characters of women are not full of show pieces
 cinema us daur main he jahaan heroinon kii umr yaa unke marital states kaa koi mahatv nahin he
 Sonam Kapoor will be a bride wearing this designer's dress! Komal says this is why Bollywood has made films on different subjects in the last 10 to 15 years
 inamen se tamaam filmon main umradraj yaa shaadishuda heroinon ne maa (shridevi), tumhaari sulu (vidya baalan), hitchkee (rani mukherjee) jaisi badi safal filmein di hai
 Even after marriage, these heroines are successful # 1 career
 kaajol:bollywood main is trend kii shuruyaat 2000 se thik pehle hui thi
 Then in 1999, in the peak of a successful career, Kajol decided to marry Ajay Devgan
 haalanki unhone shaadi ke baad bhi filmon main kaam karnaa jari rakhaa or bataur actress kabhi khushi kabhi gam, phna, maai nem ij khan, you me or ham, dilavaale jaisi safal filmon main kaam kiya
 She is currently busy with 'ila'
