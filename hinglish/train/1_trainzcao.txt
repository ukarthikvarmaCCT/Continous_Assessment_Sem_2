 Angry farmers have decided to press the 'NOTA' button, exasperated by the exodus and divine disaster
 'veeron kii dharti' kaha jane vaala bundelkhand desh main maharashtra ke vidarbha jaisi pahchaan bana chukaa he
 The territory of Bundelkhand is divided into Banda, Chitrakoot, Mahoba, orai-jalaun, Jhansi and Lalitpur in Uttar Pradesh and Tikamgarh, Chhatarpur, Sagar, Datia, Panna and Damoh districts of Madhya Pradesh
 yah ilaaka pichley kai saalon se prakritik aapadaaon kaa dansh jhel rahaa he or kisaan karj va marz ke makadjaal main fanse hue hai
 Almost all political parties have been expressing false sympathy for the farmers, but the issue of farmers migrating from here has not been made an 'electoral issue'
 samooche bundelkhand main sthaneey mudde gaayab hai or jaateey bayaar bah rahi he
 Suresh Rackwar, a metropolitan social activist who had lost so many farmers due to lack of work, says that two years ago, the Union Cabinet's internal committee presented a shocking report to the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) on the plight of farmers in the area and some recommendations for development
 But this report is still blowing dust in the PMO

 Development will stop only when Exodus: Rikwar said that this committee recommended the package of Rs 3,866 crore for seven districts of UP and Rs 4,310 crore for six districts of Madhya Pradesh, besides the formation of Bundelkhand Development Authority to improve the condition of Bundelkhand
 Had done, but till now the central government has not implemented it
 rajowar yah bhi bataate hai ki sirf upi ke hisse vaale bundeli kisaan kareeb chah arab rupee kisaan credit card (kesisi) ke jariye sarkari karj liye hue hai

 Dinkar said that the BSP relies on work, not on announcement
 is chunaav main basapa satta main ai to palaayan ko mukhya mudda maanakar kaam kiya jayega
 Saket Bihari Mishra, secretary of Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee, said on this issue that Rahul Gandhi has always been kind to Bundelkhand, special package has been given only on his recommendation, but the current SP government has spent its funds for other works
 vah kehete he ki congress ke ghoshnaa patr main kisaan hit ko sarvopari rakhaa gaya he or unhen bharosa he ki 16veen loksabhaa main rahul kii aguai main sarkaar banegi or bundelkhand ke kisaanon kaa palaayan ruk jayega
 Promotion of Irrigation Resources: Baburam Nishad, President of the Bundelkhand region of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), says that Congress, BSP and SP are responsible for the plight of farmers, BJP has made it clear in its manifesto that the party will come to power Pradhan Mantri Gram Irrigation Yojana and by providing agricultural loans at low interest rate will improve their financial condition
 kisaanon ke palaayan par die gaye tark se kisaan or raajnneetik vishleshkon ke vichaar juda hai

 unhone kaha ki rajya sarkaar ke kaam kaaj kaa faisla sirf janata hi karegi
 He said that i do not care about what the Prime Minister said about me, the final opinion is of the public what she thinks about me? Buddhadev said that during his meeting in Delhi, the Prime Minister never said the correct way of his government Did not complain about not working

 saal 2018 main bharat main saahitiyik melon kii ginati kahaan tak pahunchi par hindi ke ek behad charchit aalochak kii tippanee thi ki 329
 If we add book fairs to it, then this number will definitely go beyond five hundred
 sahitya ke liye, shabdon or kitabon or usase jude logon ke liye isse behatar samay ab se pehle kabhi nahin tha
 But if asked what was the most special fair among them, obviously 'sahitya Aaj Tak' will be named by one opinion
 sahitya ke duusare melon se alag isaki rangath or mizaaj ne ise melon kaa sirmaur bana rakhaa he
 a major feature of 'sahitya Aaj Tak' is that the fair has not yet cast any shadow of any controversy or factionalism, nor has it been accused
 sahitya ajtak kii bhavyata ko vahi samaj saktaa he, jisane is meley main shirkat kii ho yaa isaki koi jhalak dekhi ho
 But before the discussion of literature Aajtak, which has been established as the biggest annual promissory of literature and the Mahakumbh of literature, let us take a look at the fairs which are decorated in the passing year
 melon kii yah fehrist rashtriya pustak nyaas ke sahyog se dilli ke pragati maidan main lagane vaale ‚Äòvishwa pustak meley‚Äô se hi hoti he
 In the year 2018, 800 publishers with 1500 stalls participated in this fair
 europea sangh ke 35 lekhakon kii bhagidaari ne ise khaas banaaya tha
 There was no controversy in the 2018 World Book Fair, but the celebration of Shabdotsav during the book fair made it special
 isi maheene jaipur litarechar festival bhi laga, jisamen har saal kii tarah kai videshi lekhakon ne shirkat kii
 Bollywood is a bad name, it is against the nationalist sentiment: Brahmaputra Literature Festival was held in Assam's capital in Javed February
 is meley main hindi or anya bhartiya bhashaaon ke lekhakon ke alaava antarrashtriya str ke lekhakon or vichaarkon ne apni baat rakhi thi

 Haryana Sahitya Akademi organized the literary dialogue and composition program
 madhya pradesh sahitya academy ne bhi ek bada jalsa kiya
 The biggest threat to democracy right now is: Literature festivals continue in many small cities of Ashok Vajpayee, including cities like Dehradun, Haridwar, Bareilly, Banaras, Madhubani, Palamu and Bulandshahr
 dilli main to saal ke aakhri din tak meley sajte rahe
 This was also the second year of the literary event Literaria in Kolkata, in which there was a good participation of writers and readers
 ‚Äòlitreeria -2018‚Äô main desh bhar ke varisht va yuva lekhakon, kaviyon or rangamanchakarmiyon ne shirkat kii
 Many literary fairs were held last year in the country or abroad
 hindi ke saath sanskrit ne bhi kadamtal kiya

 vishwa sanskrit sammelan duniya ke kisi bhi desh main teen varshon main ek baar yojit kiya jaataa he

 But in the third edition of its debut among this crowd of fairs, the success and fame of Sahitya Aaj Tak astounds
 beetaa saal ‚Äòsahitya ajtak‚Äô kii bhavyata ke liye bhi lambey samay tak yaad rakhaa jayega
 What country, no fair in the world achieved such a feat of success in such a short time of its beginning, which Aaj Tak touched
 is meley ko lekar logon ke utsaah ne hi ise dusron se khaas banaaya
 It has certainly become a great corner of literature in terms of audience participation and the nature and variety of events
 isaki kamyaabi kaa andaaj isi se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki teen dinon kaa yah aayojan sampann bhi nahin hua tha ki sahityakaron, lekhakon, kalakaaron, shaayaron, kaviyon, vichaarkon, chintakon, darshakon or praayojakon ne iske agle sanskaran ke liye apni utsukata or taiyaari dikhaani shuru kar di

 ve kehete hai, ''ve parrikar kii sirf haa main haa milaate hai
 "south Block's files have got rusty
 mantralay ke ek naukarshah ne jab pareshaan hokar ek file maangi, to usase kah diya gaya ki file ab tak daftar se chali nahin he
 Parrikar raised Rs 8,000 to 10,000 crore through these same bureaucrats
 tak kii ek rank, ek pension yojana paas karwaai thi, jisane unhen purv sainikon kaa chaheta bana diya, lekin kharid ke maamle main unka chaabuk nahin chal paa rahaa he
 The mistake is not only with the Ministry of Defense
 raksha mantralay ke sutara niyamit kharid main bhi piemo or vitt mantralay kii dakhsandaji kaa hawala dete hai
 The only deal that has overcome all odds is the laser designation pod (LDP) made by Israeli arms manufacturer Rafael
 is pod kii madad se unnat miraj 2000 ladaaku vimaan jameen par kisi nishane par bilkul sateek tareeke se hamalaa kar saktaa he
 Last year, a note from CCS was sent to the Finance Ministry asking about the past of this Israeli company
 raksha mantralay ne jawaab diya ki france dwaara unnat kiye ja rahe 49 miraj jet ko chalaane ke liye aldypi ek anivaary ghatak he or ise satarkta vibhaag kii manjuuri mil chuki he
 In February 2015, the Finance Ministry asked the Defense Ministry whether LDP could be turned into a Make in India project
 jawaab ayah itani der ho chuki he, ab yah mumkin nahin he kyonki 28 karod dollar ke qaraar main 30 fisadi of set laagat bhi shaamil he
 Any change in it will void the agreement
 april 2015 main pariyojna jaise hi sisies ko bheje jane ke liye taiyaar hui, piemo ne phi r se vahi sawaal uthaa diya, ki kya aldypi ko mek in india project main tabdeel kiya ja saktaa he? yah maamla july se raksha sachiv ke paas lambit he
 The biggest secret to paralyzing the policies of the budget is that the central government does not have the money to handle all previous defense contracts
 sanket mil rahe hai ki modi sarkaar rafel jaise saudon ko tarjeeh degi jisase ahm sahyogi deshon ke saath kootnithik rishte aage bad sakenge
 Parrikar is expected to sign an agreement to jointly build the Kamov utility chopper in India during a visit to Moscow beginning on 5 October
 maamla akele paise kii kami kaa nahin he
 Such minor changes in defense policy have also been unnecessarily stuck due to which the expenditure of defense industry can increase
 isi saal agast main raksha mantralay ne apni ofaset niti ko durust kiya he jo raksha companiyon ko apane videshi saajheedaar badalane kii chhot detaa he
 This demand was raised by the defense industry for the first time in October last year as it raised Rs 30,000 crore
 ke anubandhon ko prabhavit karti he
 Nripendra Mishra had to make several rounds to get it notified by the Defense Ministry babus
 purv raksha mantri antni ne rishwatakhori main lipt hathiyaar fermon ko kaali suchi main daal diya tha jise parrikar ne may main ''uttejnaa main uthaaya gaya kadam'' bataaya or sanket diya ki ve kaali suchi ke bare main nayaa najariya pesh karenge
 Despite this, three such policies with which Parrikar could break the deadlock of Antony era are stuck in his office
 nai niti aisi he jo kisi agyaat shikaayat ke aadhaar par kharid kii prakriya ko patari se utaarne nahin degi, iske liye shikayatakarta kii vaidhata sabit kerani hogi
 Secondly, the new policy will also decide that there should be no injustice to the companies and the purchase should not be stopped on suspicion
 ek teesri niti raksha agenton se judi he jo kahati he ki hathiyaar nirmaataa companiyaan aapurtikartaaon ke sabhi madhyasthon ko soochibaddh karaayengi
 a month has passed but only the policy with unknown complaints has been approved
 kisi ghotaale kii halki-si bu bhi saudon ko roke de rahi he
 For example, Rs 9,000 crore
 main chah mid air rifular vimaan kharidne kaa vaayu sena kaa prastaav 2014 se sisies main atka padaa he
 Its manufacturing company European Aeronautics Defense and Space Company (EADS) changed its name to Airbus
 vitt mantralay ne satarkta prakoshth se manjuuri kii maang kii kyonki air india ko 2005 main 43 vimaan bechney sambandhi 8,300 karod ru
 Airbus is facing a CBI probe in the case of the contract
 saansad or raksha par sansadeey samiti ke sadsy rajeev chandrashekhar kehete hai ki upie ke daur main jo of da shelf kharid kii gai, uski maujuuda sarkaar kii samiksha ke kaaran deree ho rahi he
 He says, "legitimate defense purchases need to be tested once again to convert them into the Make in India program
" '' raksha mantralay ab bhi july main jamaa kar di gai dhirendra singh cameti kii report ko pard rahaa he
 The ten-member committee, headed by the former home secretary, recommended a change in India's procurement policy and called for the private sector to be brought in for the same
 is saal ke ant tak raksha kharid prakriya 2015 jab jari kii jaaegi to mana ja rahaa he ki cameti kii siforeeshon ko usamen jagah di ja sakati he
 Obviously, the Ministry of Defense is the only one on such institutional reform and it will help the forces to prepare themselves for future threats
 parrikar to abhi buniyadi faisle hi nahin le paae hai
 In such a situation, the hope of major reforms seems blurred

 unhone kaha ki sarkaar kisaanon par hi boj daalati he
 According to the new rates, farmers will have to pay 12% tax on fertilizers, 18% on pesticides and 12% on tractors
 kisaan netaa dushyant nagar kaa kahana he ki "tractor ke spair parts par to 28% tex lagegaa
 We have requested Finance Minister Arun Jaitley ji not to impose this burden on the farmers ‚Äù
 bhartiya kisaan pehle hi kai morchon par betahasha dabaav kaa saamana kar rahaa he or taxon kaa badha hua boj uski aamadani main send lagayegaa
 Even if the prices of the produce somehow increase, the whole country will face problems, because the prices of food items will increase and the common man will get in trouble
 pappu bataate hai ki unhen pataa chalaa he ki jiesti ke baad khaad kii keemten badhane vaali he isliye pehle hi buaai kaa kaam khatm kar rahe hai
 He said that the government puts a burden on the farmers
 nai daron ke mutabik kisaanon ko urvarkon par 12%, kitnashkon par 18% or tractor par 12% kar dena padegaa
 Farmer leader Dushyant Nagar states that "28% tax will be levied on spare parts of tractors
 hamane vitt mantri arun jetali ji se nivedan kiya he ki kisaanon par ye boj naa daalen"
 The Indian farmer is already facing tremendous pressure on many fronts and the increased tax burden will dent his income
 agar upaj kii keemten kisi tarah badhati bhi hai to puure desh ko dikkat hogi, kyonki khaane-pine ke saamaanon ke daam badhenge or isse aam aadmi pareshaani main aa jayega

 Union Coal Minister Sriprakash Jaiswal has said that our government has an absolute majority and no power in the world can take the Prime Minister's resignation
 jaiswal ne kaha ki bhaajapa bahut jaldbaaji main he kendra main satta paane ke liye lekin vah nahi jaanati ki janata dekh rahi he ki vah desh kii sansad ko chalaane main kis tarah se baadha pahunchaa rahi he or janata iskaa jawaab unhen chunaav main degi
 Jaiswal said that the government has set up an inter-ministerial group which is investigating the matter
 If a company has made a mistake in the allocation of coal blocks, then its coal block allocation will be canceled
 Will be canceled and if anyone makes a very minor mistake, he will be given a warning notice
 koyala mantri ne aage kaha ki iske alaava sibiai bhi is maamle main jaanch kar rahi he or agar koi gadabadi paayi gayi to vah kadi karrwai karengi
 Even after this, if there is anything left, our government is ready to debate in Parliament, but no power of the world can take resignation from the Prime Minister at the behest of any political party
 jaiswal ne kaha ki raajnneetik shadyantra ke tahat bhartiya janata party desh main araajaktaa failaane kii koshishen kar rahi he usko shaayad yah maaloom nahi he ki unki is sajeesh kaa jawaab dene ke liye congressi kaaryakarta desh ke kone kone main taiyaar he
 The constitution of the country should not be weakened and the law and order of the country should not be disturbed in any way, for this, our government and our party are fully committed
 agar kisi bhi raajnneetik dal dwaara desh kii kanoon vyavastha ko haath main lene kii koshish kii jaayengi to uskaa har tarah se jawaab dene ko ham taiyaar he
 Jaiswal said that the BJP workers had earlier asked to meet us, so we had given them time from 9 am to 11 am, but the BJP workers did not come on time
 We condemn him for trying for a brutal and violent demonstration, cautioning the BJP that he should desist from his antics, yet he has not seen the anger of Congress Hai, the Congress worker can be tough but if someone tries to insult the Constitution of the country and disturb the law and order then the Congress worker will give him a befitting reply
 unhone kaha ki aaj unke ghar ke saamne bhaajapa kaaryakartaaon ke patharav main congress party ke aath kaaryakarta ghayal huye he tathaa kuch kaaryakartaaon kii gaadi tod di gayi he
 We have asked all these workers to file a police complaint against BJP leaders and workers
 pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne spasht kiya ki vah apane pakistani samakaksh yusuf raja gilaani par aankh mundakar vishwaas nahin kar rahe hai or donon deshon ke bich shanti prakriya main pakistan ke sashastr balon kii bhi sahmati he
 He said that India wants to strengthen the hands of the civilian government of Pakistan and Gilani has clearly understood that another attack like Mumbai would be a great blow to the peace process
 gilaani ne brihaspativaar ko maale main bhent ke dauraan gilaani ko amanpansad vyakti kaha tha
 While returning from the Maldives, Singh, while answering questions from reporters in a special aircraft, said that the indo-pak peace process has been the victim of many incidents
 unhone kaha ki unki pakistan yatra keval tabhi hogi jab pakistan mumbai aatankwaadi hamale ke aropiyon ke khilaaf thos kadam uthayega
 Singh said that i would not like to go into detail in this matter but when i spoke with the Prime Minister of Pakistan that there is agreement in the (dialogue process) of Pakistan's armed forces then i realized after a long time that Pakistan's armed forces Are also together in this process
 unase jab pakistan kii videsh mantri hina rabbaani khaar ke is daawey ke bare main poocha gaya tha ki sena kii bharat ke saath shanti pahal main sahmati he lekin jab singh se poocha gaya ki unhone kis baat ko lekar gilaani ko amanpsand vyakti kaha, tab unhone kaha ki vah unase chaar paanch baar mil chuke hai or baar-baar donon ne dwipaksheeya muddon par charchaa kii he, charchaa ke dauraan unke samakaksh is par sahamat the ki sabhi samasyaon kaa shantipurna hal ke alaava or koi rasta nahin he tathaa aatankwaad se is prakriya main madad nahin mil rahi he
 He said that i can believe that Pakistan has a democratic government
 hamen is loktantric sarkaar ke haath majboot karne chahie
 Singh said that with his desire to normalize bilateral relations and trade and to move forward on terrorism related issues, i think that as Gilani, Pakistan has a Prime Minister who is ready to work with us
 gilaani par vishwaas karne ke bare main puche jane par pradhanmantri ne kaha ki aisa nahin he ki him kisi par aankh moond kar vishwaas kar rahe hai chaahe vah kitna hi samajhadaar vyakti kyon na ho
 Prime Minister Gilani and i believe in normalizing relations
 unhone kaha ki vah or gilaani is baat par sahamat the ki vaarta kaa doosraa daur shuru hona chahie or jis tarah pakistan ne bharat ko sarvocch tarjeeh vaale desh kaa darja dekar apane parivartit drushtikon kaa parichay diya he or vah aatankwaad sahit sabhi muddon par baatcheet ko icchhuk he, aise main vyapaar sambandh ke vikaas ke liye vaarta kaa doosraa daur aavashyak he
 "therefore, i have returned with the hope that the second round of talks with Pakistan will start soon, but what will be the outcome of that dialogue, i cannot say at the moment as india-pak relations are affected by the events," he said
 singh ne kaha ki ham donon ne yah sweekaar kiya ki yadi mumbai hamale jaisi ek or koi ghatana ho gayi to yah bahut bada jhatka hoga
 i think Prime Minister Gilani also understands this very well
 pradhanmantri ne kaha ki unhone apane pakistani samakaksh ko yah spasht kar diya ki bhartiya janata mumbai hamalon ke jimmedaar logon ke khilaaf pakistan kii karrwai ko lekar santusht nahin he
 He said that until there is no progress on this issue, the peace process cannot proceed
 unhone kaha ki pakistan bharat main ek nyaayik ayog bhejne par raji he or uski yatra kii ruparekha taiyaar kii ja rahi he or uske baad meri ummid he ki kuch pragati hogi
 When asked about his and Gilani's statement of starting a new chapter, Singh said trade liberalization along with other confidence-building measures across the Line of Control can be a very encouraging step and in the lives of people across the Line of Control
 Improvement may come
 singh ne yah bhi kaha ki pakistan maanata he ki aatankwaad ko sarkari niti banane ko duniya main koi sweekaar nahin karegaa or isse kisi bhi samasya kaa hal nahin hoga
 He said that terrorism has damaged the image of Pakistan
 unhone kaha ki pakistan ko bataa diya gaya he ki use aatankwaad se kadai se nibatna hoga or main sochataa hum ki yah ek anya kshetra he jahaan donon desh aage bad sakate hai lekin usee ke saath hi unhone yah bhi kaha ki pakistan ke prati bharat kii pahal rahi he, ham vishwaas karte hai lekin puri jaanch parakh rakhte hai
 When asked how real is this process of testing trust and investigation, Singh said that the day India gets concrete evidence that Pakistan is engaged in fomenting terrorist actions, it will send absolutely negative signals
 jab pradhanmantri se poocha gaya ki kya vah pakistan kii yatra karne par sahamat ho gaye hai, unhone kaha ki jab kabhi gilaani unase milte hai, ve unhen yatra par aane kaa nyauta dete he, lekin maine bhi kaha he ki is yatra ke liye sahi vakt tab aayega jab pakistan kii ore se aatankwaad ke khilaaf thos kadam uthaaye jaaenge

 Giving details, General Singh said that since 1994, 988 charges have been made against military personnel in Jammu and Kashmir
 unamem se 965 maamalon kii jaanch kii gayi or 940 aarope galat sabit hue jo kareeb 95

 Regarding the Machil encounter, General Singh said that two military officers were suspended while the investigation was pending
 is ghatana main kathith rup se teen kashmiri yuvakon ko aatankwaadi bataakar maar diya gaya tha
 He said that the military investigation was being delayed due to non-appearance of three civil witnesses in the case
 ab unke bayaan darj kiye ja rahe hai
 He promised that the guilty would be punished
 lekin unhone har baar aarope lagane par sanyakarmiyon ke asainya prashasan ke samaksh pesh hone kaa virodh kiya
 General Singh appreciated the Jammu and Kashmir Police and said that he should be given more powers to deal with terrorism
 dilli police ne akaash naam ke ek aise shaks ko giraftaar kiya he, jisane ek bujurg danpati kii hatya or lut kii puri sajeesh rach daali thi
 Akash is a nurse by profession
 gwalior se nursing kaa course karne ke baadaaropiakash ne pehle do privet aspataalon main kaam kiya
 Then he turned to Delhi
 yahaan pahunch kar akaash ne ek homecare sanstha ke jariye kaam kii talash kii
 Soon Akash finds work
 darasal, south dilli kii bujurg danpati ko apni dekh rekh ke liye ek mail nurse kii talash thi
 Akash got work right there
 bujurgon kii umr 92 saal or 85 saal he
 Their children live abroad, there is no shortage of money
 lihaaja in donon ne mail nurse ko ghar main kaam par rakhaa
 But he had no idea how vicious and dangerous the boy he kept for his care
 akaash ko naukari karne ke kuch hi dinon main ye pataa lag gaya ki bujurg danpati amir hai
 Looting can be found at his home, a lot of sky, just Akash contacted his brother-in-law in Etawah
 police ke mutabik akaash kaa bahanoi apradhi pravriti kaa shaks he
 Akash's brother-in-law also gave Akash a pistol
 saath main usase kaha ki wo naukari chhod de taaki vaardaat ke baad police kaa shaq un par naa jaae
 Akash quit his job on May 31 to pursue his plot the following week
 uski yojana donon bujurgon ko maar kar ghar main lutpaat kii thi
 But Aakash's conspiracy was discovered by a police informer
 us mubir ne police ke saamne sajeesh kaa khulaasa kar diya
 After this, the police got into action
 sabase pehle police ne akaash ke phone ko servilans par laga diya
 As soon as the entire conspiracy was revealed, the police caught Akash
 police ne akaash ke paas se ek pistal or chaar jinda kaartoos bhi baraamad kar liye
 Now the police is looking for Akash's brother-in-law
 is ghatana ke khulaase se do bujurgon kii jaan batch gai
 The attacks of Russia and France had already caused isis's feet in Syria to be uprooted
 ab britain bhi
 Has jumped into this battle
 idhar, pradhanmantri david camran ne royal air force ko hamale kaa hukum diya or udhar toranedo fiter jetts ne syria main barbaadi kii nai kahani likhane kii shuruyaat kar di
 Earlier there was a long debate in the UK Parliament on the question of whether or not to carry out airstrikes against IS
 or aakhirkaar british sansad ne hamale kii ijaajat de di
 Tornardo Fighter jets of the Royal Airforce of the UK flying in the rains of the ground and flying in the air
 syria main iesas ke khilaaf chhide jang kii ye sabase taaja tasviir he
 The picture in which Britain is now seen in an active role
 britain kaa faisla kitna ahm he, iskaa andaja isi baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki syria main iesas ke thikaanon par yun bam barasaane ke liye britain kii sansad ne puure saadhe das ghante tak jabardast maathapai kii
 After this, when the right to attack got 397 votes against 223, then the Prime Minister of UK David Cameron ordered the attack to the Royal Air Force
 virodhiyon ne diya tha ye tarksyria main hamale ko lekar britain kitne asamanjas main tha, iskaa andaja isi baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki unhen saansadon ko apane saath lene ke liye bahut bhavukta se apil kerani padi
 Prime Minister David Cameron said, should we fight with our allies to destroy such terrorists
 ? yaa hamen aiseatankwaadiyonke ghar main ghus kar unhen maarna chahie? yaa phir hamen chupchaap us ghadi kaa intjaar karnaa chahie, jab wo ham par hamalaa karen?haalanki virdohi lagaataar ye tark de rahe the ki syria ke log pehle hi vahaan ho rahe hamalon se kaaphi pareshaan hai or ab is ladaai main nae sire se britain ke kudane se unki pareshaani or bad jaaegi
 It is quite possible that along with terrorists, common people and especially women and children should also become victims of this
 lekin aakhirkaar sansad ne faisla hamale ke haq main hi diya
 a new twist came from Britain's decision: America had started the front against ISIS long back
 isamen nato mulk bhi america kaa saath de rahe the
 But after the ISIS attack on Paris on 13 November, many such countries of the world also decided to directly fight ISIS, who were involved in this fight from behind the scenes
 syrian raashtrapati bashar al asad ke daavat par rus bhi takreeban dedh maheene se syria main bambaari kar rahaa tha, lekin france par hue hamale ke baad khud france ne bhi is ladaai main rus kaa saath dene kaa faisla kiya
 This was the first time since the second world war, when France and Russia together were targeting any of their enemies
 lekin ab is maamle se sabase nayaa mode britain ke faisle se aayaa he, kyonki britain ne bhi france or rus jaise mulkon ke saath sidhe syria main iesas ke thikaanon par hamale kii shuruyaat kar di he
 Terrorists dazed by the ongoing Russian bombing at ISIS targets in Syria
 ek baar phir nafrat kii sari hadein paar kar deen
 This time, following his bloody ritual, he not only beheaded a Russian spy, but as usual
 uskaa bhi video soshal site par daal diya
 But in this new clip different from earlier videos
 aatankwaadi angreji yaa arabi main nahin balki roosi bhashaa main baat kar rahaa tha
 The 8-minute video reminded the jihadist Johnnfrat to go beyond all limits and slit the throats of humans like him, ISIS terrorists have now released another video of awe
 is baar ye video he ek aise roosi jasoos kaa
 It is being said that he was spying ISIS for Russia while staying in Syria
 kisi nadi yaa jhil ke kinare filmaaya gaya ye video us jehadi jon kii yaad dilaataa he, jise iesas kii taraf se is khooni ravaayat kii shuruyaat kii thi
 But the biggest difference between this video and John's video is to keep his face open for the ISIS terrorist who beheads him this time
 faujee libaas main khadey iesas ke is aatankwaadi ne apane haath main ek aisa chaaku le rakhaa he, jo aam taur par commando istemaal karte hai
 And in this 8-minute video, he is seen threatening Russian in Russian language before killing his victim
 or to or khule chehrevaala ye aatankwaadi khul kar rus ke raashtrapati bladimir putin kaa bhi naam letaa he or kahata he ki syria ke raashtrapati bashar al asad ke bulaave par rus ko syria main iesas ke thikaanon par hamalaa karnaa baari padegaa
 This is the open threat of terrorist
 The terrorist said, "russian people, you will regret it and you have to be disappointed
 ham tumhen bataanaa chaahate hai ki syria main jari roosi hamale se hamaare iraade or majboot honge
 You will not be able to rest in your homes
 ham tumhaare bacchon ko bhi vaise hi maarenge, jaise tum syria main hamaare bacchon ko maar rahe ho
 Just as you are ravaging our houses in Syria, we will also ravage your houses
 'ISIS ne todi darindagi kii sari hadeniraq or syria main 21 agast 2014 se bandhakon ko maarane kaa jo silsilaa jari hua he wo aaj tak badastoor jari he
 In both these countries, the slaughter has been going on for the last 10 months
 laashon kii sahi ginati kaa kisi ko pataa nahin or koi ye bhi nahin bataa saktaa ki bagdadi ke belaag ho chuke aatankwaadi aakhir kab rukenge
 Now it is an everyday thing to find human corpses on the scorching sands of the desert areas of Iraq and Syria
 par sawaal ab bhi vahi he
 The question is how long this video and the process of killing innocent people will continue like this and how long the ISIS terrorists will continue to haunt the world

 ' Cricket may not be a popular sport in America, but there is no shortage of unique fans of Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni in America as well
 riti sports kii vining wez charity ke liye erizona gaye dhoni kii vahaan ke governor dag dusi (doug Ducey) ne jamkar prashansa kii he
 The comments unhone kaha ki dhoni ek america jaanbaaj pat tillman jaise lagate hai
 Former American footballer Pat Tillman took part in campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan and lost his life
 america se lautakar dhoni aath saal baad apane pehle gharelu match ke liye taiyaar ho gaye hai
 Dhoni is set to play in the Vijay Hazare Trophy in Alur (karnataka), led by captain Varun Aron
 34 saal ke cricket ke superstar dhoni ne isse 8 saal pehle 2007 main mushtak ali trophy main hissaa liya tha
 This can prove to be a big opportunity not only for the cricketers of Jharkhand but also for the cricket players of Jammu and Kashmir
 donon hi tiimon ke khilaadi emesadi se seekhney kaa ye mauqaa nahin ganvaana chahenge
 He said that Dhoni resembles Pat Tillman, an American braveheart
 purv america footballar pat tillman ne iraq or afghanistan ke abhiyaanon main hissaa liya or apni jaan ganvaa di
 After returning from the US, Dhoni is ready for his first home match after eight years
 dhoni alur (karnataka) main hone vaali vijay hazaare trophy ke is match main captain varun aron kii aguai main khilne ko taiyaar hai
 Dhoni, a 34-year-old cricket superstar, took part in the Mushtaq Ali Trophy in 2007, eight years before that
 yah na keval jharkhand ke cricketron ke liye balki jammu-kashmir ke cricket khilaadiyon ke liye bhi bada mauka sabit ho saktaa he
 Players from both teams will not want to miss this opportunity to learn from MSD

 hameshaa hi vishwa cap ke semifinal mukaable kaaphi romaanchak rahe hai
 Something similar happened this time too
 mujhe behad khushi he ki newjiland pehali baar final main pahunchane main safal rahaa he or iskaa puraa shrey brendan maikulam kii captaini ko diya janaa chahie
 He has captained a team in a very aggressive way, which no one had expected to reach here
 vishwa cap-2015 kaa final barabari kii tiimon main he, lekin mujhe lagata he ki hamen is baar aisa vijeta mil saktaa he, jo pehali baar vishwa cap ko apane ghar lekar jayega
 The fate of the Indian team did not support
 usne semifinal se pehle saare match badi aasaani se jite, lekin aakhirkaar semifinal main phir se ubhaar par aa chuki australia se haar gai
 Steve Smith snatched the match at the beginning of Australia's innings
 bhartiya gendbaajon ne shuruyaat acchhee kii thi, lekin unhone kuch dhili genden bhi phenkin, jinka phayda uthaane main smith ne koi hichak nahin dikhaai
 Aaron Finch could not catch his rhythm but he supported Smith a lot
 yah unka behtareen pradarshan to nahin tha, lekin ve shaayad isaki ginati apni sabase acchhee pariyon main karenge
 The Indian bowlers and fielders worked hard to restrict Australia to 328 runs, a competitive score
 haalanki ek samay aisa lag rahaa tha ki australia kaa score 350 ran tak pahunch saktaa he
 Our players took the match back to the side with wickets of Glenn Maxwell, Finch and Michael Clarke, but Mitchell Johnson's fiery 27 runs made a big difference, which helped Australia put up a strong score
 bharat ne ek thos shuruyaat kii or salaami ballebaajon ne badhibia or samajhadaari bhari ballebaaji kii
 He showed a good coordination of caution and aggression
 lekin 15wein or 22wein over ke bich ham 22 ran hi bana sake, jabaki is bich hamane teen keemtee wicket ganvaa die
 And from here, the match leaned towards Australia
 dhoni or rahane viketon ke jaldi gir jane kii vajah se ran banane kii gati tej nahin kar sake or rahane ke ajeeb dhang se out hone ke baad baaki ke ballebaajon ke liye yah kaam or bhi mushkil ho gaya
 Much has been done in the knockout stages
 quarter final or semifinal ke muqablon ne dikhaa diya he ki vishwa cap kaa yah charan jitna khiladinnon kii pratibha or unki kshamta kii pariksha letaa he, utana hi unke manobal ko bhi taulata he
 If i had to compare four quarter finals and two semifinals, the most interesting aspect was how each team performed in times of need
 srilanka kii team ne quarter final main jaldi-jaldi wicket ganvaakar pratidwandvi team ko apane upar puri tarah se haaavee hone kaa mauka de diya
 As a result, his journey to the World Cup came to a standstill
 usase pehle srilanka kii team toornament main kaaphi achche khel kaa pradarshan kar rahi thi
 And especially Kumar Sangakkara was batting extremely well
 uske gendbaaj bhi acchhee gendbaaji kar rahe the
 Unfortunately, he had a bad day against South Africa
 yah dekhakar dukh hua ki dakshin africa kii team semifinal main apana pradarshan jari nahin rakh pai or newjiland ke khilaaf kamjor sabit hui, haalanki yah match antim over tak romaanch se bharaa rahaa
 It will be counted in some very exciting matches in the history of cricket
 grant iliyat ne khel ko palat kar rakh diya
 New Zealand will now use this confidence well against Australia in the final
 kuch tiimon kii jeet or kuch tiimon kii haar main manobal ne pramukh bhoomika nibhaai
 New Zealand maintained their morale during the semi-finals at a critical time
 mujhe dakshin africa ke saath sahanubhuti he, jinhone badi bahaduree se saamana kiya, lekin ek baar phir final se ek kadam dur rah gaye
 i can imagine how sad this team must have been
 e
 B
 divilliars ne puure toornament main badi budhimaani se captaini kii or is team ke ballebaajon or gendbaajon ne jarurat ke samay acha pradarshan kiya, lekin mahatvapurn maukon par kuch galtiyaan unhen kaaphi mahangi sabit huin
 Similarly, Dhoni and his players should be congratulated that they played well throughout the tournament and kept winning
 hamen yah bhi yaad rakhana chahie ki quarter final main dakshin africa ke shandaar pradarshan ne do mahaan khiladinnon sangakaara or mahela jayavardhane ke kariyar kaa dukhad ant kar diya
 Both are very skilled batsmen, who have performed very well throughout their career
 unhone kuch shandaar pradarshnon ke alaava kuch behad yaadgaar saajhedaariyaan bhi nibhaain jo apane aap main behtareen misaal hai
 Like a
 bi
 Said the right thing, the sun rises and life goes on
 kuch mahaan khiladinnon ke kariyar kaa ant acha nahin rahata, jabaki ve tarif ke hakdaar hote hai
 The memories of the 2011 World Cup final always filled me with joy, while the 2003 final was a sad one in which we lost to Australia
 vishwa cap ke final main khelnaa ek anokhaa anubhav hota he, jiskaa koi sani nahin hota
 When you reach there, it is a different adventure
 lekin vah romaanch jaldi hi ghabrahat or dabaav main tabdeel ho jaataa he
 And when you win, there is immense happiness
 duusari ore final haarane par jitna dukh hota he, vaise dukh kaa anubhav kisi ko na karnaa pade
 But this is the reality of this great game
 donon hi tarah ke anubhavon se guzar chukne ke baad main khush hum ki dakshin africa semifinal main hi haar gaya
 It is far better to see the face of defeat than to lose in the final of the World Cup
 bharat ke maamle main bhi yah baat lagu hoti he
 i do not like it when the Indian players reach the finals and face defeat there
 main kalpana kar saktaa hum ki pehali baar final main pahunchane ke baad newjiland ko kitni ghabrahat or khushi ho rahi hogi
 Australia will definitely get the benefit of playing on home ground
 lekin ham newjiland ko katai kamatar nahin aank sakate he
 He has played superb cricket throughout the tournament and it is his chance to create history
 jahaan hamen donon tiimon ke dhamaakedaar pradarshan kaa intjaar he, vahiin hamen duusari tiimon kii bhi tarif kerani chahie, jinhone is vishwa cap main behtareen khel dikhaaya he, khaskar bharat, dakshin africa or srilanka tarif ke hakdaar hai
 It is also to be remembered that before 2011, no team had the distinction of winning the World Cup at their home ground
 pichley vishwa cap main do mejabaan desh final main pahunche the or jis team ko gharelu maidan kaa phayda mila tha, vah vijayi rahi thi
 This time also two host countries have reached the finals
 ham is baat kii ummid karte hai ki behatar team hi jeet hasil kare

 Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Raman Singh has suddenly played a big bet
 ab sarkari vibhaagon kaa sara kaamkaaj hindi or angreji kii bajaae chhattisgadhi bhashaa main hoga
 Chhattisgarhi language was given the status of state language in 2007, but it could not be implemented even after 10 years
 ab jabaki san 2018 main rajya main vidhansabha chunaav hone hai
 For this this trump card has been bounced
 haalanki congress samet tamaam kisaan sanghathan is baat kaa aarope laga rahe hai ki dhyaan bhatakaane ke liye bijepi sarkaar ne bhashaai card khelaa he, jabaki beete 15 dinon main das kisaan aatmahatya kar chuke hai
 This step of the government before the assembly elections, Chhattisgarh language is being taught in the Ministry of Government of Chhattisgarh to employees and officers these days
 unhen chhattisgarh bhashaa kii baarikiyaan bataai ja rahi hai
 All correspondence from writing the notesheet will now be in Chhattisgarhi language

 But now it has been stopped
 chhattisgarh kii vidhaan sabha main bhi chhattisgadhi bhashaa main prashn lagenge or mantriyon ko isi bhashaa main uskaa jawaab dena hoga
 Ever since the formation of the state of Chhattisgarh in 2001, the movement to give this language the status of the state language had gained momentum
 san 2008 main hone vaale vidhaan sabha chunaav ke maddenjar tatkaaleen raman singh sarkaar ne ek saal pehle 2007 main chhattisgadhi bhashaa ko rajkeey bhashaa kaa darja de diya tha

 All the documents used in government departments to embody the training given to the officers in the Chhattisgarh language will now be drafted in the Chhattisgarh language

 It is the effort of the government that within a month all the work should be conducted in the state language
 iske liye gaiyr chhattisgadhi yaa phir hindi or angreji kaa istemaal karne vaale karmchaariyon va afasaron ko chhattisgadhi bolne kaa prashikshan rojaanaa diya ja rahaa he
 However, in this training it is also being told that Chhattisgarhi language is not hated by Hindi and English or any other language

 The Congress too agrees and argues that this is an attempt to divert public attention
 jabaki kisaanon ko raahat dene yaa phir unke aansu ponchney ke liye kisi package kaa elaan hona chahie tha
 In the last 15 days, farmers have committed suicide in the state over the last 15 days due to the repayment of debt, if there is no timely sowing and wastage of crops

 They will discuss with their families the difficulty of sowing and other problems in the future
 congress ke pradesh adhyaksh bhupesh baghel ke mutabik dhyaan bhatakaane ke liye bhashaai card sarkaar ke kaam nahin aayega
 In fact, the large population of farmers is angry because the BJP government has vowed with them and did not make any effort to improve the condition of the farmers

 Advocating "small steps" to enhance the dialogue process on Jammu and Kashmir, central negotiators said on Wednesday that the release of political prisoners, stone throwingers and removal of curfew would go a long way in ameliorating the situation
 
 kashmir kii chaar divasiy yatra ki baad jane maane patrkaar dilip padaganvkar ke netritv main teen sadasyeey vaartakar dal jammu pahunchaa
 Meanwhile, the state BJP said it would boycott the interlocutors appointed by the Center to talk to various parties in Jammu and Kashmir

 He said that the comments of the interlocutors have raised doubts about his credibility
 vaartakaron kii tippanee se rajya main rashtravaadi takaton kii bhavanaaen aahat hui hai 
 The BJP also objected to the interlocutors meeting jailed people and Hurriyat leaders
 vahiin, kashmir ke liye centre dwaara niyukt vaartakar jammu kashmir vidhansabha main 2000 main paarit swaittata sankalp ke mudde par bhaajapa netritv se baat karenge
 Padgaonkar said, "we will meet BJP leader LK Advani on the autonomy resolution after returning to Delhi and find out why the resolution was rejected
" ‚Äô‚Äô baharhaal, vaartakaron ne kaha ki rajya main sabhi vichaaron ke logon se baatcheet karne ke atirikt unke paas desh main sabhi pakshon ko vishwaas main lene kii ek badi jimmedaari he
 Dilip Padgaonkar, who is heading the three-member committee, said in an open conversation with reporters here, "if the parliament that leads the country's political vote is not taken into confidence then the effort will be in vain
" ham jaanate hai ki yah ek bada daayitv he, lekin ise kiya janaa he
 Padgaonkar said that in an effort to find a holistic and sustainable solution, the interlocutors got valuable information during the four-day interaction with various sections of society in Kashmir
 unhone kaha, ‚Äò‚Äòhamane kashmir par raajnneetik maton ko suna or logon ke saamne rojaanaa aane vaali swatantra hokar na gum paane yaa bacchon ke liye doodh na mil paane jaisi samasyaon ke bare main bhi janaa
 He said that no one should expect big steps after the team's first visit to the state and "we will take small steps to move the dialogue process forward
" ‚Äô‚Äôpadaganvkar ne kaha ki aaj or kal jammu main isi tarah kii baatcheet karne ke baad samooh rajya main sthiti main sudhaar ke liye centre ko sifarish karegaa
 He said that the interlocutors wanted to meet the BJP leader before coming to the state, but this was not possible due to Advani's preoccupation
 us samay vidhansabha main neshnal conference ko kareeb do-tihaai bahumat hasil tha or sadan ne july 2000 main vah sankalp paarit kiya tha
 But it was rejected by the central government while the National Conference was in the NDA government at that time

" yadi 12 yuvak pradarshan karnaa chaahate hai to dhara 144 (nishedhaatmak aadesh) nahin lagaai ja sakati 
 Pointing to the remarks of BJP MP Ram Jethmalani, Padgaonkar said that a senior leader of a political party criticizing him withdrew from the party line to support him
 unhone kaha, ‚Äò‚Äòtathy yah he ki sansad dwaara paarit ek prastaav (jammu kashmir ke pakistani kabje vaale hisse ko waapas lene ke liye) pakistan ko ek party bana detaa he

 Whenever there are more problems in a person's life, no work is being made, there is lack of confidence or some other problem, then reading Sunderkand, the solution of all the problems starts coming out on its own
 kai baar vidwaan pandit or jyotish bhi kashton kaa nivaaran karne ke liye sundarkand kaa paath karwaane kii salaah dete hai
 Psychological benefits of doing Sundarkand The story of Sundarkand of Sri Ramcharitmanas is different
 sampoornashriramcharitamanas bhagwaan shriramke gunon or unke purusharth ko darshaati he
 Sundarkand is the only chapter that marks the victory of Hanuman's devotee Hanuman
 manovaigyanik nazariye se dekha jaae to yah aatmavishvaas or ichhashakti badhaane vaala cond he
 a person gets mental strength through the recitation of Sundarakand
 kisi bhi kaary ko purna karne ke liye aatmavishvaas miltaa he
 What is Sundarkandhanumanji who was a monkey, he crossed the sea and reached Lanka and discovered Sita there
 lanka ko jalaayaa or sita kaa sandesh lekar shriram ke paas laut aae
 This is the victory case of a devotee who can perform such a great miracle on the strength of his will
 sundarkand main jivan kii safaltaake mahatvapurn sutara bhi die gaye hai
 Therefore Sundarakand is considered the best in the whole Ramayana because it increases confidence in the person
 isi vajah se sundarkand kaa paath vishesh rup se kiya jaataa he
 Reciting this incident persists Hanumanji's worship of Kripahanumanji is considered to fulfill all wishes
 shastron main inaki krupa paane ke kai upaay bataae gaye hai, inhen upayon main se ek upaay sundarkand kaa paath karnaa he
 Along with Hanumanji from the recitation of Sunderkand, Shriram also gets special grace
 kisi bhi prakaar kii pareshaani ho, sundarkand ke paath se dur ho jaati he
 Keep these things in mind in the worship of Hanumanji, according to the scriptures, some rules have been given for the worship and philosophy of Hanumanji, these rules should be followed while worshiping and doing darshan
 
 
 
 - There is a law to do three circumambulation of Hanumanji
 bhakton ko inaki teen parikrama hi kerani chahie
 - At noon, Bajrang Bali can be offered to Churma made with jaggery, ghee, wheat flour
 - hanumanji ko shaam ke samay fal jaise aam, kele, amaruud, sevefal aadi kaa bhoga lagaana chahie
 While reciting Sunderkand, Hanumanji should also offer vermilion, jasmine oil and other worship materials

 It started on September 15 when the SP inducted 43-year-old Imran Masood, nephew of Congress MP Rashid Masood, who had interfered heavily in the politics of western Uttar Pradesh, and former MLA from Muzaffarabad seat Saharanpur
 14 sitambar ko achaanak purv kendriya mantri sompaal shastri ke bagpat se sapa kii ummidavaari chhodie ke elaan se sakate main ai sapa ne agle hi din masood ko party main shaamil kar pashchimi jilon main muslim sameekaran kaa saadhane kii koshish kii
 Imran Masood has also been in the SP before and he joined the Congress before the 2012 assembly elections
 baat yahi nahin rukii
 Instead of persuading the angry Sompal Shastri, the party handed over the Lok Sabha election ticket to Ghulam Muhammad, MLA from Sewal Khas Assembly constituency in Baghpat, on 16 September
 asal main mujffarnagar dangon ke baad pashchimi jilon ke jaateey sameekaran kaaphi had tak badal chuke hai
 The sharing of Jat and Muslim votes has created scope for the SP to formulate its electoral strategy afresh
 yahi vajah he ki bagpat main rashtriya lokdal ke rashtriya adhyaksh ajit singh ke saamne jat pratyaashee na khadaa kar sapa ne muslim pratyaashee ko tarjeeh di he
 In the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, the SP gave the ticket to Jat as Sahib Singh from Baghpat
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav kii taiyaari main juty sapa ne sabase pehle is seat se jat netaa vijaypal kii ummidavaari kii ghoshnaa kii thi lekin may main inhen badal kar purv krishi rajya mantri sompaal shastri ko tikat thama diya tha

 donon IPL team kings ilevan punjab ke ko-honor hai
 From Liril Girl to the IPL franchise, was this the case of Preity Zinta's film journey? The Punjab and Chennai matches were going on at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai on 30 May 2014
 tabhi priti jinta or ness wadiya kaa saream jhagada hua tha
 The actress had alleged that Ness abused, molested and abused her at the stadium
 priti jinta ne shikaayat main kaha tha, ness tikat distribution par staff ko daant rahe the
 During that time i was sitting near there
 maine ness se kaha tha ki hamaari team jeet rahi he tum shant ho jaao
 In the IPL auction, Chashmi started abusing Juhi Chawla's daughter, Preity Zinta, but she had forcibly pulled my hand, scratching my hand
 actress ne saboot ke taur par police ko 4 tasviren bhi saunpi thi
 Preeti had scratches on her right hand
 bataa den ki priti ke pati jin gudenf bhi is ghatana ke dauraan stadium main maujuud the
 He had his statement recorded via email
 tab court ne wadiya ko 20 hajaar ke nijee muchalke par reeha kiya tha
 Dated for five years, Priti dated Ness for about five years
 kaha yah bhi jaataa he ki ness kii maa kii vajah se donon kaa jhagada hua
 By the way, Ness Wadia, while giving his clarification on the whole case, had termed all the allegations as baseless and false
 haalanki abhi jab kuch din pehle IPL-10 ocshan hue the tab ness-priti ko saath main dekha gaya tha
 Let me tell you, Ness is the son of businessman Maureen Wadia and managing director of the Bombay Burma Trending Corporation in the Wadia Group

 In the MCD elections, even though the BJP is delaying the announcement of tickets, the party is also working on its first tried formula in these elections
 dilli main bijepi upi-maharashtra kii ranneeti ko doharaa rahi he, jisamen pehali praathamikta jeetne kii guarantee vaale ummidavaar ke liye hogi, phir bhale hi usamen party ke kisi netaa kaa bhi tikat kyon na cat rahaa ho
 The BJP had given a tremendous blow to Arvind Kejriwal by joining Aam Aadmi Party's MLA in the party a day earlier
 bavana ke emele veda prakaash ne na keval party or vidhansabha se istipha diya, balki bijepi daftar aakar party kaa pataka bhi pahan liya
 Now BJP President Manoj Tiwari is claiming that like Ved Prakash, there are many troubled mlas in the Aam Aadmi Party, who are in touch with the party
 bijepi ke rashtriya mantri sardaar aar pi singh ne kaha, ' kejariwal vidhayakon ke saath kaisaa bartaav karte hai, yah unki party chhod chuke vidhayak bataa chuke hai, ab koun-koun party chhod rahaa he, yah unako bhi pataa he, isliye puri party ghabaraayi hui he
 In the past several elections, including realbjp UP, Maharashtra, has adopted a strategy to weaken the opponents by breaking leaders from the other party, as well as the bjp's formula that even if the winning candidate meets the other party, then he should also join the party
 can go
 emsidi chunaav main bhi bijepi kii ranneeti yahi najar aa rahi he
 Perhaps this is also the reason behind the delay in ticket distribution for MCD elections
 haalanki bijepi ke netaa daawa kar rahe hai ki bijepi duusari partiyon ko nahin tod rahi he, balki duusari party ke netaa hi bijepi kaa daravaaza khatkhata rahe hai, kyonki sabhi modi ji se aakarshith ho rahe hai
 According to the party's state vice-president Rajiv Babbar, the BJP is giving a chance to new people, which is why there is a churn on tickets in the party
 zaahir he bijepi ke pasupi kii jitse mila utsaah he or iske baad bane maahaul kaa phayda uthaane main bhi party peeche nahin he, yahi vajah he party ke faislon par andruni virodh ke sur bhi baahar nahin aa paa rahe hai

 Police will ask many questions Peter Mukherjee reached Khar police station at around 10:30 am on Wednesday
 bataaya ja rahaa he kipulice is maamle menunase das sawaal kar sakati he
 To which they will have to answer
 isamen sabase ahm batyah ho sakati he ki kya peter ko vaaki abhi tak nahin pataa tha ki shina indrani kii beti he
 Did he not know anything about Mikhail
 kya peter koshina or rahul kii sagise koi aapatti nahin thi

 peter ne teen baar badale hai bayanindrani kii giraftaar ho jane ke baad peter mukherjee ne pehle kaha tha ki unhen shina or rahul ke rishte ke bare main unke bete rahul ne khud bataaya tha
 Later Peter said that Sheena Bora himself had informed him about the relationship between the two
 unke mutabik shina ne unhen bataaya tha ki indrani unhen galat jaankaree de rahi he
 i am not his sister's daughter
 police ko peter par shakpiter ne khaar thane main jo likhit bayaan police ke paas darj karaayaa tha, usamen phir se kahani badali hui thi
 The question is that if Peter knew Sheena as Rahul's stepmother, then why did he not find this relationship awkward? Did Peter hide the truth or did he hide himself? For these reasons, Peter is now under police suspicion
 peter ne kya kaha tha ajtak seis maamle kaa khulaasa hone ke baad star india ke purv siio peter mukherjee ne phone par ajtak se baat kii thi

 shaayad unhen hatya ke bare main bhi kuch pataa ho
 The evidence given by Mikhail to the police
 usamen bhi kahin na kahin peter kaa zikr he
 Surprised even working with Peter, it is astonishing that Peter Mukherjee could not know the reality of Indrani and Sheena in 13 years
 jabaki unke saath kaam karne waalon kaa kahana he ki peter bahut smart or budhimaan vyakti hai
 That's when he is a successful business man

 karj ke bare main sahi faisla kaise lemochha banaam bura karjasbase pehle yah pukhta karen ki aap karj kyon lenaa chaahate hai
 Sage Mehra of Wishfin

 ''unke mutabik, "bura karj ek aisa sauda ho saktaa he jisamen bahut oonchi byaaj dar tay kii gai ho
 Even if you take a loan to buy an expensive vehicle that you don't really need, it can be a bad debt
 ''kisi vaazib vajah ke liye aap kuch kharidte hai to isse yaa to aapako ek sampatti taiyaar karne main madad milti he yaa isse aapke maujuuda / bhavishya kii aay ko badhaane main madad mil sakati he
 Mehra says, "buying an asset with a rising price like a house can make a loan good and you can also get the benefit of income tax rebate
 '' property kharidne se kiraye ke rup main aamadani yaa property ke mulya par capital gen hasil karne kaa mauka miltaa he
 Education loan gives you a chance to earn more in future, so it is considered a good loan
 aise asset par karj lene se bachanaa chahie jinke mulya main giravat aa rahi ho

 For example, you should pay the outstanding credit card bill first

 You have to multiply whether repaying the loan first is less expensive or paying interest on it
 ''aapke upar yadi credit card kaa bakaayaa he or aap sirf nunatam raashi kaa bhugtan kar paa rahe hai to sabase pehle aapako is chakree karj se mukti pani chahie, kyonki is par 40 fisadi tak kii byaaj dar lagati he
 After this, settle other expensive loans, such as personal loan, auto loan, loan against gold, property loan etc

 *** American aircraft carrier Boeing was preparing to make a big leap in the world of aviation through its 787 Dreamliner project in the 2000s
 is taiyaari par grahan tab lag gaya jab use is drimliner ke sapane ko saakaar karne ke liye bharat kaa rukh karnaa padaa or ummid ke mutabik bharat main uskaa project yun atka ki bowing chaaron khaane chit hokar baith gai
 Indeed, the 787 Dreamliner aircraft is extremely important for the production of titanium metal
 behad sakht hone ke saath-saath titanium bahut halki dhaatu he or isliye vimaan kaa nirmaan bina is dhaatu ke puraa nahin kiya ja saktaa tha
 At the same time, the price of titanium in the global market started skyrocketing due to the possibility of using this metal by Boeing
 lihaaja bowing ke paas sirf ek vikalp bachaa ki vah bharat ke andhrapradesh main maujuuda titanium kii khadaan se is dhaatu ko nikaalkar apane vimaan nirmit kare or samay rahete apane order ko puraa kar vah aviation kii duniya main apni badshahath ko kaayam kar le
 But everything could not be done according to the script
 neuyark times kii report ke mutabik titanium kii talash main bowing ne global kansalting form maikinji and company se sampark kiya

 In a power point presentation presented by the company, 8 important Indian officials were named who were asked to bribe and make the deal successful
 khasbaat he ki ukraine kii company kii is ranneeti par kansalting form maikinji and company ne koi aapatti nahin uthaai thi
 When titanium metal was needed to complete the Boeing aircraft's Dreamliner project, the US company chose the Ukraine company that played an important role in the gas deal for Ukraine from Russia and the former Soviet republics
 yah company ukraine ke prabhaavshaalee kaarobaari dimitri phirtash ke netritv main thi
 But Boeing and Ukraine's company plans to take titanium mine in India failed after which Boeing sued Firtash in US court because in the failed deal Firutash bill of about 130 crores as bribe to Indian officials
 Was handed over neuyark times kii report ke mutabik america court main dimitri phirtash ke is kathan ki usne bhartiya adhikariyon ko lagbhag 130 karod rupee kii rishwat di thi ko aage nahin badhaayaa ja sakaa
 Because the Government of India did not interfere in the dispute that arose between the companies of America and Ukraine nor the claims of Ukraine businessman were investigated
