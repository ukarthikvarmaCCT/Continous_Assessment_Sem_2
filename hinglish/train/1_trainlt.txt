 Most people have a habit of withdrawing less money from VOATM
 aise logon kaa maananaa he ki aisa karne se kharche par lagaam kasi ja sakegi
 In this way, people use ATM many times
 kuch aise log bhi hai jo net banking yaa mobile banking kaa zyada istemaal karte hai or account belans check karne ke liye atm kaa istemaal karte hai
 If you fall into any of these categories, then you should change your habit as the RBI has issued new guidelines regarding ATM usage fees
 atm istemaal ke tahat cash nikaalnaa, account balance check karnaa yaa mini statement lenaa shaamil he
 Under the new rules of the Reserve Bank, the bank's ATM can be used free of charge five times a month, while other banks' atms can be used free thrice
 desh ke sirf chah mahanagaron- mumbai, nai dilli, chennai, kolkata, bengaluru or hyderabad main duusare bank ke atm main har maheene muft istemaal kii sankhya ghataakar teen kar di gai he jiske baad graahak ko vittiya len-dein ke liye 20 rupye or gaiyr-vittiya len-dein ke liye 8
 50 rupees will have to be spent
 gaiyr-metro shaharon main duusare bank ke atm kaa har maheene atm kaa paanch baar muft istemaal kiya ja sakegaa jiske baad shulk lagegaa
 The country's largest public sector bank SBI has implemented this decision from November 1, while HDFC Bank and Axis Bank have implemented it from December 1
 desh ke sabase bade nijee bankaisiaisiaine ek janvari 2015 se apane atm shulk main badhotaree kaa elaan kiya he
 The issue of ATM usage has been highly controversial as banks have to pay fees for inter-linking each other
 iske alaava pichley saal bengaluru main atm par hui lut jaisi ghatnaon ke baad oparation cost bad gaya jisase len-dein fees par charchaa shuru ho gai he
 The new rules of RBI are impacting most of the people of the country
 aise main ham aapako yahaan kuchtipsbata rahe hai jisase atm tranjaction ke nae niyamon ke baad bhi aapaki jeb par asar nahin padegaa
 1
 cash tranjaction se bachein:agar aap un logon main hai jo har kharidari or anya vittiya lenden ke liye cash tranjaction kaa istemaal karte hai to aap doosraa rasta bhi apana sakate hai
 Instead of using cash every time, you can use electronic fund transfer, credit and debit cards, checks and demand drafts
 2
 Change the habit of withdrawing less money After increasing the ATM transaction fees, take special care not to withdraw the minimum amount from the ATM
 3
 Go to the bank to withdraw cash: If you want to withdraw cash in large amounts, then it is better for you to go to the bank branch instead of going to the ATM
 haalanki, bank kii shakha main jane se aapako thodi asuvidha ho sakati he lekin atm tranjaction fees se bachane ke liye yah acha idia he
 However, if you need to withdraw this kind of cash only once a month, then it is better to use the ATM by paying a small charge than putting a line in the bank
 4
 Use of Online Banking for Statements Most people use atms to check their account statements, take mini statements or print recent transactions
 atm istemaal ke tahat cash nikaalnaa, account balance check karnaa yaa mini statement lenaa shaamil he, aise main account statement ke liye aap atm jane ke bajaay online banking kii suvidha kaa phayda uthaa sakate hai

 The researchers studied the profiles of 1
3 million Facebook users who wrote 'in a relationship' in the relationship status
 iske saath hi yah bhi dekha gaya ki fasebuk par in yugers kaa friendship network kitna bada or inke kitne mutual frends hai
 Research has revealed that people who have a similar social circle on Facebook are less likely to live with them
 yani ki agar kisi kapal ke fasebuk par zyada mutual frends hai to unke brallep kii ashanka bhi zyada rahati he
 In other words, by creating a network of different friends, couples can enjoy a strong relationship with the partner while enjoying their personal space

 Some time ago it was kind of assured that the Aadhaar card is absolutely safe
 aadhaar banane vaali athurity UIDAI ne bhi kaha tha ki aadhaar card main har kisi kii nijee jaankaree bilkul surakshit he
 But if you think so then it is absolutely wrong
 aap maatr 500 rupee dekar maatr 10 minute main karodon aadhaar card kii jaankaree hasil kar sakate hai
 This thing is a bit shocking, but such a claim is being made
 angreji akhbaar, da tribune ne ek tahakikat kii he jisamen is tarah kii baton kaa khulaasa hua he
 According to the Tribune, he bought the service from a whatsapp group for just Rs 500 and got access to about 100 crore Aadhaar cards
 darasal, unki tahakikat main unhen ek agent ke bare main pataa laga
 After which the agent gave a gateway in just 10 minutes and gave the login password
 uske baad unhen sirf aadhaar card kaa number daalana tha or kisi bhi vyakti ke bare nijee jaankaree aasaani se mil gai
 After giving Rs 300 more, they also got access to print the information of that Aadhar card
 iske liye alag se ek software tha
 This information is being leaked - Name, address, PIN code, photo, phone number, email ID taken by UIDAI
 When the UIDAI officials were informed about this, they immediately took cognizance and informed the matter to the technical team in Bangalore
 chandigarh main UIDAI kii riginal edshinal doirector-general, sanjay jindal ne bataaya ki agar ye sach he to kaaphi chaunkaane vaala he kyonki doirector-general or mere alaava kisi or ke paas log-in password nahin hona chahie
 According to the newspaper, this group has been working for about 6 months
 ek racket ne sabase pehle un teen lakh logon ko target kiya, jo ki IT mantralay kii ore se kaaman sarvice centre skim ke tahat jo centre khole gaye the vahaan par kaam karte the
 He thought it easy to extract all the information about Aadhaar from these people and trapped them in his own grip
 iske alaava havers ke paas rajasthan kii aadhaar card website kaa bhi acces mil gaya
 With which they could get Aadhaar information and print it
 sanjay jindal ne kaha he ki abhikuidhaiis baat kii jaanch karegaa, tabhi kisi bhi tarah kii pushti kii jaaegi

 The shocking story of a pregnant woman is becoming quite viral on social media
 kahani main daawa kiya gaya ki america kii ek mahila ne 17 hamshakl ladakon ko ek saath janm diya he
 This viral post has three photographs and a story has also been written
 ek photo main ek garbhvatee mahila selfi leti hui dikh rahi he, jiskaa pet asaamaanya dikh rahaa he
 In the second picture, some small children are seen and in the third there is a man with children
 post main bataaya gaya he ki Catherine Bridge naam kii ek america mahila ne ek saath sabase zyada bachche paidaa karne kaa record banaaya he
 India Today anti-fake News War Room (AFWA) found in its investigation that the viral post was fabricated
 ye khabar World News Daily Report naam kii ek website main chhapi, jo mouj masti ke liye kaalpanik khabar chhapati he
 The post was shared by a Facebook user named Richard Camarinta Dy, who has been shared more than 33,000 times so far
 Richard Camarinta Dy ne is post main‘women Daily Magazine’naam kii ek website ke artical ko bhi share kiya tha, jisamen is viral post kaa zikr he

 Snopes and HOAX OR FACT have also rejected this viral claim

 manish tiwari ne kaha, '2014 loksabhaa chunaav prachaar main piem modi ne logon se vaada kiya tha, achche din aaenge, jisamen har saal do karod rojgaar kaa vaada bhi shaamil tha
 This meant 10 crore jobs should have been created in five years
 'unhone centre for monitering indian iconomi (siemii) kii report kaa zikr karte hue kaha ki saal 2018 main ek karod se zyada naukariyaan khatm ho gayi
 The senior Congress leader based this report and said that 40 by December 2017
 79 logon ke paas rojgaar tha, jo ab ghatakar 39
 07 is left
 iskaa matlab he ki ek karod se zyada logon kii naukariyaan chali gai
 Manish Tiwari also claimed that the unemployment rate of 7 in December 2018
 4 pratishat bad gai he
 It has passed more than a decade
 bade paimaane par naukariyon ke khatm hone kaa sidhaa asar ashikshit mahila kamgaaron, dihadi or khet mazdooron ke saath hi chote vyapaariyon par sabase zyada hua he
 Taking a dig at the Modi government, he said that this government has failed to understand that the crisis in the society and the smooth operation of the economy cannot happen simultaneously

 ) According to MCD data within Delhi, 12 new cases of malaria have been reported in the past week
 in saare maamalon main jahaan 1 shaks dilli kaa he to vahiin 11 anya rajyon ke hai
 a total of 125 cases of malaria have been reported in Delhi so far
 inamen se 63 dilli ke hai or 62 cese duusare rajyon ke hai
 Actually, larvae of dengue and chikungunya thrive only in clean water but malaria mosquitoes thrive in dirt and any kind of stagnant water
 beete hafte hui barish kii vajah se dilli main jagah-jagah pani bhar jane se malaria kaa khatra bad gaya he
 To date, when the team visited the Mukundpur area of north Delhi meanwhile, it was found that a large number of mosquitoes were seen thriving in the stagnant water after the rain among the dirt
 jis jagah machhar punap rahe hai vahaan se paas main hi mukundpur, bhalswa, jahangirpuri or ajadpur ke saath-saath model toun jaisi posh coloniyaan bhi hai
 Seeing the pictures, it is known that the claims of MCD may appear effective on paper but the ground reality is completely opposite
 is bare main jab hamane north dilli kii meyar priti agarwal se baat kii to unhone tasveeron ke ulat hi bayaan diya
 He said that there are no cases of dengue, chikungunya and malaria in North Delhi
 jabaki emsidi kii hi report ke mutabik north dilli main 24 malaria ke maamle saamne aa chuke hai
 Here, let us tell you that within the last two weeks, 32 cases of malaria have been reported in Delhi
 jabaki dengue or chikangunia ke maamle sainkada paar kar chuke hai
 Apparently, even though the MCD is making air-aerial claims on the basis of government data, the rain and humidity as well as the filled water has increased the risk of dengue and chikungunya as well as malaria in Delhi

 ab jabaki pathankot airbase par chal rahaa oparation chah aatankwaadiyon ke maare jane ke baad lagbhag samaapti kii ore he, aisi baaten saamne aa rahi hai ki cmand or control ke maamle main is oparation main kai kamiyaan raheen
 During this, there was a deadlock between the Army, the Air Force and the NSG over control of the operation, which resulted in losses
 oparation kii najdiki se nigaraanee karne vaale ek varisht army officer ne mujhe bataaya, 'planning kii drushti se yah pichley teen dashak se bhi adhik samay kaa sabase kharaab oparation rahaa
 ' mujhase baat karne vaale ormi ke kam se kam do sheersh adhikariyon, jaahir taur par jinka naam nahin bataaya ja saktaa, kaa yah maananaa tha ki is oparation kii sampurna cmand hameshaa kii tarah army ke paas hi rahani chahie thi, kyonki isse pehle aisa koi bhi maamla nahin hua he, jisamen kisi bhi sakriy oparation kii cmand army se lekar grih mantralay ke adheen aane vaali pratishthit police force neshnal security gards ko di gai ho
 In this case, the command was given to the NSG after two columns (about 60 personnel) of the army were deployed in view of the threat of a terrorist attack hovering over the Pathankot airbase
 purv senadhyaksh general veepi malik ne kaha, 'army ko kisi aatanki hamale ke oparation ke liye bulaae jane par uski cmand army ko saunp di jaati he or phir yah to airfield oparation ke dephence kaa maamla tha
 ' vishwast sutron ne mujhe yah bhi bataaya ki ek army brigadier commanding oparations or grih mantralay ke aadesh par pahunchi enesji team ke inspector general (oparations) ke bich ise lekar jabardast gatirodh rahaa
 This situation became more complicated when the Air Officer Commanding, Western Air Command was asked to go to Pathankot to take important decisions related to the operation of this operation
 isse nayaa gatirodh paidaa ho gaya, jo is baar air force or enesji ke bich tha
 There was a tremendous lack of cooperation and coordination between these various agencies
 aakhirkaar, army brigadier, jo major general rank vaale enesji ke aiji (oparations) se junior the, ve peeche hat gaye
 Thus the NSG took over the entire command of the remaining operation, while the Air Officer Commanding, an Air Marshal was also present at the airbase
 army ke sheersh sutron ne NDTV ko yah bhi bataaya ki unka iraadaa ise army viruddh enesji banane kaa bilkul nahin tha, kyonki donon force ke javaanon dwaara aatankwaadiyon ke khilaaf vaastavik ladaai to army ke hi hathiyaaron jaise BMP-2 armard personal karier or caspir mine-protected whical se hi ladi jaani thi, kyonki ye goliyon, rocket yaa grenade ko diflect kar sakate hai yaa unka majbootee se saamana kar sakate hai
 However, they are questioning the priority of the NSG in these operations in lieu of 50, 000 personnel of the Army, armed with tremendous military resources, having a capacity equal to the two divisions of the Army present in Pathankot
 general malik ke anusaar, 'enesji ko bhejne kaa faisla galat tha
 This operation was to be conducted only by the personnel of the Division of Military Forces well versed with the scene
 isse prakriya main teji aa jaati
 ' isamen bhi dhyaan dene vaali baat yah he ki bhartiya sena kii ek vishesh sainya tukdi, jo aatankwaadiyon se muqabla karne ke liye prashikshit he use aatanki hamalaa hone se pehle hi pathankot main tainaat kar diya gaya tha, lekin is ladaai ke dauraan vah aatankiyon ke saath kabhi bhi sidhe mukaable main nahin rahi
 Instead, it was deployed to protect the base's 'strategic assets' such as fighters, helicopters, ground-to-air missiles or radar systems

 Experts also disagree with Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar's statement, in which he defended the deployment of the NSG, saying, "there were common citizens as well
" is campus main lagbhag 3000 aam naagarik rahete hai, iske hisaab se enesji behatar dhang se prashikshit hoti he

 unka kaam kisi bhi paristhiti ko sidhe dakhal se hal karnaa hota he
 According to the Lieutenant General, the NSG can be placed in a standby position for any such situation, but cannot be given charge of any such operation as the Army has been in Kashmir for many years
 bhale hi pathankot main oparation khatm ho gaya ho, lekin usase jude tathy barkaraar rahenge
 Even though hundreds of jawans saved the base from being bloodied, the question is how the six terrorists were able to infiltrate the airbase fully equipped to counter the terrorists? Not only this, how did he take the martyrdom of seven Indian soldiers and succeed in injuring 20? oparation kii najdiki se nigaraanee karne vaale ek varisht army officer ne mujhe bataaya, 'planning kii drushti se yah pichley teen dashak se bhi adhik samay kaa sabase kharaab oparation rahaa

 com / py2qf2x4vi — Konkona Sensharma (@konkonas) August 21, 2015 Irrfan Khan, Tabu, Konkona Sen Sharma will be seen in the lead roles in this film
 yah film gandhi jayanti par 2 oktober 2015 ko relies hogi
 Union Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh, in a special conversation on the situation arising out of the declining rainfall for the second consecutive year in the country and 10 states declared drought-affected, called the release of the app for the Prime Minister Crop Insurance Scheme a big step in the interest of farmers and the Prime Minister Agricultural Irrigation Scheme Emphasized to remove the corruption present in it
 pesh hai baatcheet ke khaas anshakprah aap jab se krishi mantri kii kursi par baithe tab se chaar fasalon par sankat aayaa, is chunauti se kaise nibat rahe hai aap?uh sarkaar jab ai to us vakt desh main mines 10 fisadi barish hui thi
 We immediately prepared a contingency plan for 500 districts and provided it to the states
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne khud pahal karke dijal, chaare, bagwani or har anya jaruri cheez par rajya sahaayta uplabdh karai
 The effect of this was that sowing declined by only 3-4 per cent
 jitani badi aapadaa thi usase nibatane main ham sakasham rahe
 Q: But this kharif has received 14 per cent less rainfall? U: This time it is 14 to 20 per cent less
 hamane 600 jilon ko contigency plan muhaiyaa kara diya he
 Has provided 93 types of drought resistant seeds
 kisaanon ne mehnat kii rajyon ne sahyog diya
 What is the result, see today that the production of coarse grains has increased by six percent
 dalhan kii buaai yaa to pichley sijan ke baraabar hogi yaa adhik ho sakati he
 By this time, there is a reduction of only three per cent in the sowing of rabi
 buaai kii kami kaa jo andaja tha usase kaaphi behatar sthiti he
 Q: But what is the reason that when the crisis has arisen on the Rabi crop, then the central teams are going to take stock of the drought in the Kharif: Every state has money in the State Disaster Fund when disaster strikes
 rajya ke paas anya mad main bhi paisa hota he, sahaayta ke liye
 There are some norms of the Kosh, based on which the state declares drought
 agar pichhali sarkaron se tulana karen to 2010-11 se 2013-14 tak ke chaar saal main rajyon ne aapadaa raahat ke liye centre sarkaar se ek lakh karod ru
 Demand, while the states received just Rs 13,762 crore
 hi die gaye
 In the year 2014-15, the states raised Rs 42,000 crore from the disaster fund
 kii raashi maangi jabaki hamane 9,000 karod ru
 Gave more is saal bhi 21 janvari tak andiareef se 11,742 karod ru
 Have been given prahpradhanmantri fasal beemaa yojana maujuuda beemaa yojana se kitni alag he?uh maan lijie kisaan 30,000 ru
 Rs 30,000 for his crop
 kaa beemaa hoga
 If the crop is bad then it should get a full claim
 pichhali sarkaar main ho yah rahaa tha ki apane hisse kaa premium bachaane ke liye sarkaar beemaa raashi ko kam kara detii thi
 For example, a farmer got Rs 30,000 for insurance
 kaa lekin asal main premium kam jamaa hone se beemaa rah gaya 12,000 ru
 Of
 yah sarkaar kii taraf se premium cap karne kii vajah se hota tha, ab yah cap khatm kar diya gaya he
 Q: By continuing the old ways of assessing crop loss, how will the loss be assessed faster ?: We are giving smart phones to every accountant, 25 percent claim will be available immediately with the help of mobile app
 ham drone or satellite kaa istemaal kar rahe hai? hamaara mobile ap ban chukaa he
 Guidelines will run in 2-3 days
 sab rajyon ko bhej di jaaegi
 Giving app is one thing and giving smart phone is another thing
 jaise smart phone to mere bhi paas he, jisamen main aapkaa ap downlod kar saktaa hum
 If the Lekhpal first reaches the smart phone then only then the app will work
 uh smart phone dena he, paisa hamaare paas he, jo rajyon ko de diya jayega
 It is easy to give a smart phone, it is difficult to make an app, which has been created
 prah kya aagaamee kharif sijan main fasal beemaa ap aadhaarit takanic se milegaa?uh aap yah likhie ki ap jari kar diya gaya he
 We will ask for information faster than this
 agar smart phone nahin hoga to ap kaa istemaal kaise hoga, yah to hamen bhi maaloom he
 So if the app is released and Lekhpal does not have a smart phone then the app is useless
 agar ap jari kar diya he or smart phone nahin degi, kya bharat sarkaar itani murkh he
 This is why the app is used in smartphones
 prah agar aap ko is ap par itnaa hi bharosa he to yah bataaie ki kharid 2016 main agar kisi tarah kaa sankat aata he to kisaan ko kitne din main uskaa beemaa clem mil jayega?uh yah is baat par nirbhar karata he ki rajya sarkarein kis teji se hamen sahyog karti hai
 Results will come in the same proportion as the state governments will cooperate

 kuch reports or study kaa kahana he ki period ke dauraan sex ke kai phaayde hai
 However, sex during the period has been taboo in many societies
 aaie jaanate hai kya he period ke dinon main sex ke phaayde

 Experts also say that the body releases oxytocin and dopamine from the organism

 co
 uk main chhapi report ke mutabik, isse aapako apane period pen ko bhi kam karne main madad milti he
 In fact, the hormones released by the organism are stronger than the pen killer

 Experts also link period days to the fact that you will not need a separate lube
 vahiin kai log period blad ko ghrinaa kii najar se dekhte hai, lekin asal main is blad main aisi koi baat nahin hoti
 4
 ek report main to yah bhi daawa kiya gaya he ki period main yon sambandh aapke partner ke saath conection ko bhi badhaane main madad karata he
 Actually the thinking is that people usually stay away from making a relationship in a period, if the couple closes then it will be a bold move and they will feel more close to each other
 haalanki, period main sex ke liye kapal kaa sahaj hona jaruri he or ye personal chwis bhi he
 So it is not necessary that everyone will like it and they should do so
 5
 By making a relationship in a period, you also come out of your confirmation zone and you can think of trying new things after this
 aap apni lav life main adhik andventuras ho sakate hai
 Many women have accepted this as well
 haalanki, in tamaam phaaydon ke baavjood, pehali baar aisa karnaa, kuch kapal ke liye atapata ho saktaa he
 But experts say that lest you stop trying it forever, based on first-time experience

 jaij or nazaij hathiyaaron se apana naata jod kar khush hone or aslhon main states simbel dhundhane vaale jila mujffarnagar kii sisakiyaan to vakt ke saath tham jaaengi, lekin aslhon kii ye bhukh kab or kaise thamegi, koi nahin jaanata
 The truth of the factory of illegitimate slaves
 
 
 mujffarnagar main jabase ye khoonkhraba shuru hua he, tabase band kamare main chalati maut kii factory zyada se zyada hathiyaar ugalane main lagi hai
 That is, the more weapons the thicker you earn
 jaahir he factriyon se chand logon kii roji-roti yani jindagi bhi chalati he
 But when the mouth of the weapons emanating from this factory opens, then one thing which is felt by the human being, is death and only death
 darasal, upi ke mujffarnagar main maujuud avaidh hathiyaaron kii factory hai, jinhone is jile ko barud kii dher par bitha diya he
 In Muzaffarnagar, there is not only one factory of illegitimate, but one of hundreds of factories which have been distributing deaths among people in the area for years
 magar, afsos tamaam tarakkee or tahjeeb ke daavon ke baavjood is ilaake main aaj bhi hathiyaaron kaa shauk logon ko jindagi se bhi zyada ajij he
 If this city, burnt in the fire of violence, has lost the lives of more than 35 people this time, more than half of the corpses have the death seal printed on them from such illegitimate slogans
 haal hi main ajtak ke ek sting oparation main dikhi mujffarnagar kii bhayaavah tasviren or ab hinsa ke baad maut kaa matam darasal inhen factriyon ke nikle product kaa anjaam he
 Apparently, the effect of these factories is now visible now, but its land was ready only when, like mushrooms, these factories continued to grow in Muzaffarnagar and the administration kept sleeping by putting oil in the ears
 mujffarnagar ke har ghar main he hathiyaar
 
 
 It is said that in this country, Muzaffarnagar is the place where every village and every house has some weapon
 phir chaahe wo hathiyaar jaij ho yaa phir nazaij
 But this attachment to the slang is now beginning to dominate the ganges-jamuna culture and life of this city
 tabhi to taaji hinsa se bichhi zyaadaatar laashon par nazaij aslhon se nikali goliyon ke nishaan hai
 Muzaffarnagar's relationship with district Ghaziabad
 
 
 aakhir mujffanagar kii hinsa kaa jila gajiabad se kya rishta he? bas, isi ek sawaal ne in dinon kanoon ke muhafizon kii neend uda di he
 And the reason for the sleepiness is the record sales of cartridges in Ghaziabad
 jabase mujffanagar main hinsa hui he, gajiabad main goliyon kaa bazaar garm ho gaya he
 Is it just coincidence or something else? Is it coincidental or something? Is it coincidental or something
 lekin haqikat yahi he ki mujffarnagar main hui hinsa ke baad gajiabad main kaartuson kii bikri main jo teji ai he, jisane ab tak ke saare puraane record tod die hai
 Now, the question arises that the people who are pushing Muzaffarnagar in the fire of violence are not buying the bullets from Ghaziabad somewhere? Which are being used in lawful and illegal weapons there? Due to this concern, now the Ghaziabad administration has started investigating these sales
 gajiabad main aslhon kii kul 15 dukaane hai
 And the sales of cartridges in eight of these stores have increased suddenly
 balki naa sirf badi he, sabase zyada maang 315 bor or 12 bor ke kaartuson kii ho rahi he
 While the violence in Muzaffarnagar has also revealed the use of the ingredients of these burrows
 aise main police ke kaan khadey hona lajimi he
 Sushant Singh Rajput, Manoj Bajpayee and Bhumi Pednekar starrer movie Sonchiriya is badly beaten at the box office

 The film was believed to benefit from the weekend due to Word of Mouth

 The film's performance at the ticket window was extremely disappointing
 somvaar ko bhi trade reports main jo rujhaan aae hai, usamen chauthe din 1 karod yaa usase kam kamai kii baat saamne aa rahi he
 This movie has been beaten at the ticket window
 duusare hafte iskaa tik paanaa behad mushkil najar aa rahaa he

 Even RSS wouldn't believe that ur going 2 endorse its views in ur speech
 But the speech will be forgotten, visuals will remain & those will be circulated with fake statements

 In the practice session, Dhoni hit 52 runs off 6 balls and 4 fours from Amit Mishra's 10 balls
 jis tarah se dhoni mishra kii gendon ko khel rahe the usase lag rahaa tha ki jaise wo ye messej chayankartaaon ko dena chaah rahe hon ki aakhir wo haryana ke is leg spinner ko plaing ilevan main kyon nahin rakhana chaahate hai
 Dhoni has done something similar to what Amit Mishra did to former captain Sourav Ganguly with Murali Karthik
 kai logon kaa maananaa he ki karthik kaa test kariyar keval aath maichon tak hi simit isliye rahaa kyonki ganguli ko nets par unhen khilne main kabhi pareshaani nahin hui
 Ganguly smacked Karthik's balls several times in domestic matches
 iske alaava anil kumble or harbhajan singh ke team main hone par ganguli ko gharelu yaa videshi paristhitiyon main kabhi karthik acha vikalp nahin lage
 Dhoni felt a similar attitude towards Mishra when Team India came to practice on Wednesday ahead of the T20 World Cup practice match against England
 kuch chakke cou corner (mid wicket aria) par gaye to kuch sidhe gendbaaj ke sir ke upar se nikle
 Some shots went to deep extra cover and long off
 mishra kisi bhi samay dhoni ko pareshaani main nahin daal paae
 Dhoni could not bat in the last practice session and the first practice match, so the Indian captain faced both fast bowlers and spinners today

 However, this time the strike was different from previous strikes in many respects
 ye hadtaal court parisar me nahin balki baar concil of india ke daftar ke baahar thi
 The strike was to prevent the lawyers from going on strike
 sunne me ajeeb jarur he lekin dilachasp bhi he
 The Bar Council of India sent its suggestion to the Law Commission two weeks ago that action should be taken against them if lawyers go on strike without reason
 agar unki hadtaal se mukademe se jude logon ko nuksaan hoti he to uski bhi penlti vakeelon se vasuuli jaae
 These penalties can be between 3 to 5 lakhs
 iske alaava kuch or bhi suzav hai
 It is also involved in suspending lawyers' registration
 hadtaal khatm karaane ke masale par baar council kaa kahana he ki ve siforeeshon ko waapas lene ke liye dobaaraa lau kamishan ko likhegi
 Lawyers say that the Bar Council of India has sent suggestions directly to the Law Commission without consulting the Coordination Committee of all the district courts of Delhi
 agar lau kamishan in sujhaavon ko maanakar 1961 ke act me badlaav kar detaa he to phir ye kanoon ban jaayegaa
 Lawyers say that when government employees, doctors and teachers like professionals can strike, then why ban lawyers? baar concil of india lau kamishan dwaara bheje gaye sujhaavon kaa virodh kar rahi he
 Significantly, the Supreme Court had asked the Bar Council of India to suggest to the Law Commission on the matter of sudden lawyers going on strike
 supreme court ne baar council se kaha tha ki achaanak strike par jane se bahut nuksaan hota he
 So it should be stopped
 isse cese lard rahe aam logon ko nuksaan hota he
 In the suggestion, the Bar Council of India has said that the license of lawyers should be canceled if they go on a sudden strike
 iske alaava un par penlti lagane kii bhi baat kahi ja rahi he
 Lawyers opposed to the District Coordination Committee and Bar Council protested against this suggestion

 Despite the effective action taken by the Gujarat government after the riots broke out, the Gujarat government fully cooperated to investigate all the allegations made by the organizations playing in the lap of the Congress till date
 kai pramukh aropiyon ko kadi sajaaen bhi huin
 Advocating Modi, he said that the manner in which the Congress has been following Modi for the last 11 years is completely unfair
 yadi ek maamle main adaalat bari kare to sarkaar koi na koi prapanch taiyaar rakhti he jabaki duusari taraf 1984 ke dangon main congress ne aaj tak kitne logon ko sajaa karaayi he? ulate unke netaaon par to sibiai ne ‘closer report’ tak laga di
 Rajnath said that he has full faith in the maturity and wisdom of the people of India that it will not give rise to any such situation but will give the BJP a decisive strength under the leadership of Narendra Modi to solve all the problems of the country

 The Finance Ministry tweeted that the last date for returning the GST of July month was August 25
 aise main jis bhi texapair ne is taarikh ke baad ritern file kiya hoga, us par har din 200 rupye kii penlti lagani thi
 The Finance Ministry tweeted that the people who were unable to file GST returns on time will no longer face this penalty
 Late fee for all taxpayers who could not file GSTR3B for month of July 2017 has been waived, but not the interest on late payment of dues
 - Ministry of Finance (@finminindia) September 2, 2017 But the loss will have to be borne by the government, even though the penalty has been abolished every day, but the finance ministry has made it clear that the interest on the late payments of the dews will be charged
 usase texepars ko raahat nahin di gai he
 Even after getting exempted from penalty, some amount is going to go out of your pocket due to late filing

 Here are some excerpts from this book
 
 
 ye ek fundamentlist skool tha
 Here, whenever Dubey used to teach something 'intense' on love according to the Matha Saab course, he always used to say that the lines presented are telling the union of soul and God
 lafj chaahe jitne bhi nagn hon, ughaare hon or pannon kii sej par apane priyatam ko chuum lene kii haraarat main beqaraar kasmasaa rahe hon, lekin laundon ko hameshaa yahi bargalaaya jaataa tha ki prastut panktiyon main 'aatma' chaahati he ki wo tuutakar-bikharakar 'paramatma' main samaa jaae
 Let us be at one
 bas, 'ultimetali' use jivan-maran ke chakkar se mukti mil jaae
 In such a situation, there were two types of children in the class
 ek wo, jo apni tinejri kii dahalij par ukaduun baithe apane sapanom kii shwet murgiyon ko pranay-baang de rahe hote the or khub samaj rahe hote the ki 'mari’ aatma ko aisi koun-si aag lagi padi he jo jab dekho paramatma kii banhon main samaane ko pagalaai rahati he
 a soul that cannot be wet with water nor burn with fire, what hour will that lover do! The second type of children used to be those who were praying with a full heart and with a full heart, that the union of soul and God should somehow be settled
 wo 'dilavaale dulhaniya le jaaenge' ke train vaale aakhri seen kii vivechna bhi isi tarah karte ki yahan par amrish puri 'sansar kii maaya' kaa pratik he or kaajol 'aatma' kaa praturup
 Ho-na-ho Shahrukh is the 'supreme Soul'
 film ke aakiri seen main jab amrish puri kaajol kaa haath chhod kahata he- ' ja simran, ji le apni zindagi
 'then it was clear that he was sending the soul to meet the divine through the supernatural-non-worldly journey of the train, by ridding Maya
 ye duusari tarah ke bachche bade bhole the
 But Dubey was always torn from the first kind of children
 kyonki gaahe-bagaahe unamem se koi-na-koi khadaa hokar puch hi detaa tha- ' maath saab, prastut paktiyon main kavi aatma ke madhyam se ye koun se mithe-mithe dard kii baat kar rahaa he
 It is a good thing, Maath Saab, but what kind of pain is it which seems sweet and sweet? ”dubey ji was also very good
 bacchon kii curiosity kaa bharpoor jawaab dete the
 For instance, in response to this question, he killed Neem's fifteen cane in the backyard of Vinod
 or kaha- ' ab ye jo tumhaare pichhawaade par ho rahaa he na, yahi wo meetha-meetha dard he
 Which happens to the soul often
 ab to samaj paa rahe ho na betaa binod?' vinod hamaari class ke sabase haramkhor ladakon main se ek tha
 That's why i accepted him as my mentor
 mere liye vinod ummid kii wo kiran tha jo mujhe ‘duusari tarah’ ke bachche se ‘pehali tarah’ ke bachche main tabdeel kar saktaa tha
 i wanted to be the first type of child because i fell in love and i did not want my love to be a soul-divine nonsense love
 ham sab jaanate the ki vinod puri class main akelaa aisa ladkaa tha jiske paas garlfriend thi
 However, Vinod preferred to call it item, punti or mal
 lekin mujhe aisa kahana bilkul pasand nahin tha
 Because i do not want Shruti to be my girlfriend tomorrow and someone will call her Mal
 maine pehle se tay kar liya tha ki main use ‘janu’ kahoonga
 i used to practice calling Shruti Janu in my imagination in a boring period of geography
 or itnaa soch bhar lene se mere chehre kaa maanchitr badalane lagata
 i would be thrilled to think that if Shruti turned around and called me Janu, then the damp westerly sound of her voice would hit the dry desert of my body, bringing the first monsoon of the season
 vahaan, jahaan aaj tak barish kii ek buund bhi nahin giri, aaj vahaan musaladhar barsaat aegi or mere badan ke marusthal kaa rome-rome cherrapunji ke ghasiyaale maidaanon kii hari doob-sa khil uthegaa
 Shruti also had a stubbornness
 wo harek period main mere dimaag kaa hissaa ho leti
 Like she is trying to tell me why i do not reach her and talk to her
 us din to had hi ho gai jab bhugol kii class ke baad angreji kii class main shruti lusi grey banakar aa gai
 Lucy's portrayal of each and every line of William Wordsworth's poem resembled Shruti
 angreji ke baad, ganit kii class main us din koordinate geometry padhai gai
 Shruti was also there
 parabola or ilips ke uthaan or ubhaar main
 i was there too
 acimptot banakar
 Tripathi Math Sa'b said that the asymptote is the line that joins the parabola going to infinity
 mere dil kii dhadakanen achaanak or tej ho gayi
 i could not stand and raised my hand
 ' sar?' ' haan balak, kaho kya prashn he?' 'anant par milanaa kya hota he?' 'anant par milanaa, matlab infinity par milanaa
 "yes, Math Sa'b, what is it to meet at Infinity?" 'to meet at infinity means to meet at infinity
 ' treepathi ji ne cheekhte hua kaha
 'sir, you are not understanding
 maine ye to samaj liya ki infinity matlab anant hota he
 But what is this' meeting '?' 'have you gone mad, boy? You are upset without talking
 idhar aakar murga ban jaao
 "sir, you are getting angry because of me
" man main sawaal tha to puch liya
 '' The question went to Baba Ji's loincloth
 ab idhar aakar sidhi tarah murga banate ho yaa nahin?' ' infinity par milanaa bhi kaisaa milanaa hua sar! aise to phir acimptot parabola se kabhi nahin mil sakegaa
 Why don't you simply say that the two never meet
 aisa bas prathit hota he ki donon kahin mil rahe hai
 'I replied with a sad heart, staring at Tripathi ji from between my knees that remained cocky
 meraa dil tut chukaa tha
 Along with my legs too
 aadha ghanta lagaataar murga bane rahanaa kitna kshtdaayak hota he iskaa asli andaaza tab hota he jab aap kukkad yoni se manushya yoni main waapas aate hai
 As soon as he starts walking, the balls of knees start to quarrel with gravity and friction, in which there is a feeling that suddenly both the balls of knees will pop out
 newton ne bhale hi seb ko girtaa dekh gravity ko helo bolaa hoga
 But our greetings from gravity were done by Tripathi Math Sa'b
 agar is vaqt shruti meri class main hoti to wo mujhe murga bane dekhakar zarur dukh zaahir karti
 She was not ruthless and shy like the girls in my class, who were laughing at me with a handkerchief on seeing their lips
 khaas taur par wo priyanka singhania or isha kapur jaisi to bilkul nahin thi, jinhen jitna gurur apni kubsuurati or accent vaali angreji kaa tha usase kahin adhik gurur unhen singhania or kapur hone kaa tha

 ikkis siten zyada paane ke anumaan ke baavjood aisa lagata he ki congress, madhya pradesh main bhartiya janata party ko lagaataar teesri baar sarkaar banane se nahin roak paaegi
 According to an India Today group-c voter poll, BJP may get 122 seats out of a total of 230 seats in the November assembly elections
 vah pehle se kam lekin nirnaayak bahumat ke saath sarkaar banaaegi
 The survey says that Congress will get 92 seats against 71 seats in 2008
 pichley chunaav main bijepi kii 143 siten thim
 The Congress currently has 65 mlas
 pichley do saal main party vidhansabha ke sabhi upachunaavon main haari he
 Its member and Deputy Leader of Opposition Chaudhary Rakesh Singh Chaturvedi joined BJP recently
 iske baavjood agle chunaav main congress ko 27 siton kaa phayda hoga
 Congress votes will go up by 4 per cent as against 32 per cent in 2008 and it is expected to get 36 per cent votes while BJP will get one per cent increase to 39 per cent votes
 haalanki congress sarkaar nahin bana paaegi, phir bhi surveykshan ke ye nattejey sattarudh dal ko neend se jagaane ke liye kaaphi hai
 The Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) is projected to get just one seat less than the previous election
 uskaa vot pratishat bhi ek fisadi ghatakar 8 rah jayega
 Political observers believe that the bsp's seats do not increase when they are out of power in Uttar Pradesh
 uske ek pratishat vot kaa nuksaan anya dalon or nirdaliyon ke liye phydemand hoga
 He got 9 seats in the last election but this time 10 is estimated
 survey ke mutabik bijepi ko 117 se 127, congress ko 87 se 97, bispi ko 4 se 6, or anya ko 8 se 10 siten milane kaa anumaan he
 The BJP is cashing in on the popularity of Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan

 No other leader, both BJP or Congress, seems to be going above 5%
 chouhan ke netritv main party hetric ke prati aashwast he
 On August 13, when Chauhan reached Shyamgarh in Mandsaur district of the state on his Jan Aashirvad Yatra, a crowd gathered on the roadside welcomed him with great enthusiasm

 Some current legislators can also be replaced
 congress ne vibhinn vidhansabha khandon main paryvekshak bhej die hai, jo janata kii nabj ko padhenge or tikataarthiyon se aavedan lenge to bijepi bhi ummidavaaron kii ghoshnaa se pehle jamini sachaai aankane ke liye varisht netaaon ko bhej rahi he
 In this election, both parties are not taking any risk in the matter of contesting candidates
 chouhan:madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan is chunaav main bhi bijepi ke shubhankar hai
 He has no match in Congress in terms of popularity

 In response, Chauhan has defamation claims against him
 chunaav se pehle congress mukhyamantri ko pareshaan karne ke liye un par hamale bol rahi he
 If Chauhan is leading the party in the assembly elections for the second time, then the BJP is headed for a hat-trick
 sindhiya:kendriya rajya bijli mantri jyotiraditya sindhiya kii lokapriyata 24 fisadi he
 This can be bad news for those who have been demanding for a long time that the Congress should declare him the chief ministerial candidate

 iske baad donon ko dasna jail bhej diya gayajanie, katl ke raat kii kahanekisi aparaadh visheshgy ke liye mauka-e-vaardaat ke vishleshan main kathinaayee andeh ke kshetra-masalan, uske bhugol, samajashaastra, itihaas, lokapriy samskruti, yaa rojgaar ke taur-tareekon-kii jaankaree na hone se hoti he
 In such a situation, any crime expert can be wise or mindless according to his knowledge
 aarushi-hemraj murder cese main aparaadh kaa vishleshan abhi bhi paristhitijanya sabooton par hi nirbhar he
 So with the passage of time, so many stories and analyzes have come that every piece of this piece fits into the perspective of the person reviewing it
 sibiai ke mutabik, aparaadh main maa-baap kii shirkat kaa shartiya sanket isse miltaa he ki ve yah nahin bataa sake ki aarushi ke kamare kaa taala us raat khulaa kyon tha
 The same question was also in the mind of the parents, why did they forget the key that night
 jaj shyaam laal ne bhi apane faisle main likhaa, 'aropiyon ne iskaa koi jawaab nahin diya ki aarushi ke kamare kaa taala kaise or kisne kholaa
 'but according to Nupur, that was the biggest mistake of his life
 unhone kaha, 'us raat shaayad main chaabi daravaaje main hi chhod ai thi
 The 'mauka-e-vardat' was the Talwar family's home in Noida's Climate Vihar
 talwaar parivaar do bedroom ke flats main duusari manzil par rahata tha
 This flat had many doors and windows
 usamen lakdi ke daravaaje ke saath lohe ke gril vaala darwaja or phir ek bahari lohe ke gril vaala darwaja laga tha
 Hemraj's room was inside the flat, right next to the main gate
 chat bhi talwaar parivaar kii hi thi jisaki seedhi baahar ke kaaman aria se jaati thi
 Aarushi's room was next to her parents' room on the right
 uske kamare main har raat baahar se taala laga diya jaataa tha
 Hemraj had all the keys except Aarushi's room
 yahaan kuch sutara khulte hai jo aapako pareshaan karte hai
 So, what would have happened that night? The address is as follows
 
 
 taarikh- 15 may, 2008din- mangalvarasmay- raat ke 10 baje se 12
 08 AM Takjah - Climate Climate Noida Arushi Talwar tries to read Chetan Bhagat's new book 3 Mistakes of My Life
 uske man main chal rahaa he ki sirf do din or skool janaa he or phir janmdin kii badi party he, 19 may ko der raat tak jashn chalegaa
 His mother comes into the room to turn on the 'internet button'
 rajesh kaa laptop nahin chal rahaa tha, isliye ve aarushi ke kamare main rakhe computer par kuch der tak kaam karnaa chaahate the
 Rajesh Talwar kept sending some emails and mother and daughter kept talking
 phir ve chale gaye or aarushi ke kamare ke daravaaje main har raat kii tarah baahar se taala lagaana bhul gaye
 Date- May 16, 2008 Day- Wednesday at 6 am- Every morning Bharti, who works at home, rang the bell, Hemraj opened the door for her
 lekin us subah aisa nahin hua
 She was also repeatedly playing bells and an iron outer grill
 aakhirkaar noopur aankh malate hue lakdi kaa darwaja kholti hai or andar ke lohe ke gril se puuchhati hai ki hemraj kahaan he? bharti kahati he, 'mujhe nahin pataa
 Will you throw the key down? ' When she came to see that the iron grill outside was not closed
 lekin bheetar kaa gril darwaja baahar se band he
 When he entered the house, Rajesh and Nupur were crying
 noopur uske seene se lag gayi or rote hue kaha, 'aarushi ke kamare main jaao or dekho ki kya hua
 'bharti goes inside and when Nupur removes the sheet, Bharti sees a thin stream of blood on Aarushi's throat
 noopur ro rahi he, 'dekho hemraj ne kya kiya
 'bharti asks,' Should i call neighbors? ' Nupur says, 'yes, call
 'samay- subah 6
 6 in the morning of 50
 50 baje tak police aa jaati he or 8 baje tak media
 Aarushi's body is taken for postmortem at around 9 pm
 kuch vyaktiyon kii bhayankar bhuulon ne samuhik gadbadiyon ko badhaava diya
 For example, consider the story of Chunnilal Gautam, photographer and finger print collector of UP police
 gautam ne us subah anginat tasviren or ungaliyon ke nishaan kii tasviren khinchin
 Yet 22 out of 24 finger print photos are blurred, 23 of their photos do not match the negatives
 unke paas chat par khun se sane footprint kii koi tasviir nahin he, jahaan hemraj kaa shav mila kyonki vahaan kaaphi bheed thi or khun se sani hviski ke gilaas ke finger prints kii tasviren kisi ke bhi finger prints se nahin milteen
 Surprisingly about the cleanliness of the crime where the crime took place, the bed sheet with no solids, Aarushi's genitals, he remains silent until March 2010
 uske nae daavon ne use saboot mitaae jane ke pramukh gavaahon main shaamil kar diya
 Date - May 17, 2008 Day - Thursday Time - 12 o'clock of a retired DSP
 ke
 Gautam visits the neighboring Talwar couple
 ek pulisavaale ke andeshe par ve flats kii padtaal karne kii sochate hai
 The question arises why three bottles of Sula wine, Kingfisher beer and Sprite are lying in Hemraj's room? What is the case of three glasses? Why is Hemraj's bed folded such that three people are sitting on it? Why is there so much urine in Hemraj's bathroom? In the same way, cut-throat go to the roof with steps of blood stains
 vahaan yah dekhakar hairaan rah jate hai ki chat par khun se sane haath ke chhap hai, cooler main khun jaisaa laal pani he or kone main sadaandh martha ek shav padaa he, sir par vaise hi nishaan hai jaise aarushi ke sir par the or donon kaa galaa bhi ek hi tareeke se kaata gaya tha
 There are many scars on the body
 ve kehete hai, 'may kii garmi main do din tak kadi dhoop main rahane ke baad shav kii aisi haalat thi ki rajesh bhi hemraj kii pahchaan nahin kar paae
 'the investigation went on and on the morning of 23 May, Police IG Gurdarshan Singh declared that it is honor killing
 unhone kaha ki pita or beti donon ke charitra kamjor the
 On the night of the murder, Rajesh was awake till late in the night as the internet was running till 3 am
 rajesh ne aarushi ke kamare main awaajen sunin, hemraj ko aarushi ke bistar par paaya or gusse main donon ko golf stick se maut ke ghat utaar diya
 Nupur had helped him in this crime
 maa-baap ko tehraaya doshidonon ne milakar donon kii gardan kaati,hemarajake shav ko ghasitkar chat par le gaye, mauka-e-vaardaat kii saaf-safai kii, saboot mitaae

 shuruaati khabaron ke mutabik aag bijli transformar se lagi, or teji se fail gai
 Due to the very narrow streets, the fire brigade found it difficult to reach the spot, but it is reported that some fire brigade still reached there, and succeeded in limiting the fire to a few shops
 philhal kisi jaani nuksaan kii koi khabar nahin he
 According to AK Sharma, director, Delhi Fire Service, "the initial message was for the transformer to catch fire
 
 
 baad main aag madhyam darje kii ho gai

 puraani dilli bheed-bhaad vaala vyapaarik ilaaka he, jahaan galiyaan bahut sankari hai
 
 
 " duusari ore, ek chashmadid gavaah ke mutabik, "aag ek transformar kii vajah se lagi
 
 
 This happens every week, that's all, today they have paid attention
 
 
 iske liye bijli vibhaag jimmedaar he
 
 
 " sankari galiyon kii vajah se firebrigade karmiyon ko aag bujhane or raahat kaaryon main kaaphi mushkilen pesh aa rahi hai, or pados main rahane vaale logon ko bhi apane-apane gharon kii chhaton se baltiyon main bharkar pani daalate dekha gaya
 On the commission created by the Modi government for reservation reservation, Samajwadi Party spokesman Sunil Sajan said that the Modi-led government wants to do politics by dividing the obcs on the lines of the British
 obisi ke hiton ke liye vah katai gambhir nahin he, sirf apane siyaasi phaayde ke liye obisi samaaj ke bich daraar paidaa karne kii disha main kamishan banaaya haiespi MLC sunil saajan ne aajtak
 Talking to in that the caste census has been done, instead of making it public, the Modi government is working towards distributing it to the OBC society
 angrejon ne jis prakaar samaaj main foot daalo-raaj karo kii niti ko apanaakar raaj kiya he, usee nakshekadam par modi sarkaar bhi chal rahi he
 This is the reason why they have approved the commission to seek quota in quota with the intention of distributing reservation to OBC castes in central services
 jabaki hamaari party shuru se kahati aa rahi he ki aaj jatigat janaganana ko saarvajanik karke jis samaaj kii jitani hissedari he use utana aarakshan de diya jaae
 Sajan said that the Modi government is continuously targeting Yadav and Kurmi society
 isakmishnake jariye bhi inhen donon samaaj ko nishaanaa bana rahi he, taaki obisi kii tamaam jatiyon ko yadav or kurmi ke khilaaf khadaa kar sake
 If the government feels that some castes have lagged behind socially and educationally, then the OBC should take some concrete steps for it
 lekin sarkaar ye kaam nahin karegi, balki vah samaaj ke bich main daraar dalkar apana siyaasi phayda uthaane kii manshaa he
 On the pretext of this, she wants to have a debate, then has the intention of slowly giving up reservations
 bijepi ke netaaon ne aarakshan khatm karne kii kai baar manshaa jaahir kar chuke hai
 Railways are bearing the burden of severe financial crisis
 aise main vitt varsh 2015-16 ke rail bajet main nai trainon kii ghoshnaa kaa aankada 100 se kam rahane kii sambhaavna he
 This is much less than the announcements that usually occur each year
 rail mantri suresh prabhu ko sudhaar samarthak mana jaataa he
 It is believed that Prabhu will not announce more new trains despite the demand of many states in the Rail Budget, because the railways has been stuck for many years due to lack of funds
 aamtaur par rail bajet main har saal 150 se 180 nai trainon kii ghoshnaa hoti he
 Last year, around 160 new trains were announced
 sutron ke anusaar prabhu is maamle main alag rukh apana sakate hai or sambhavat: apane pehle rail bajet bhaashan main vah adhik nai trainon kii ghoshnaa nahin karenge
 However, he can do so later in the year
 sutron ne bataaya ki rail bajet main adhik nai trainon kii ghoshnaa na karne kii laabh haani kaa akalan karne ke baad ab sanshodhit prastaav ko aage badhaayaa gaya he
 a very limited number of new trains will be announced in this
 iske alaava atirikt kosh jutaney ke liye kuch trainon kii branding bhi kii ja sakati he
 According to the proposal, these trains will have advertisements of some popular brands
 inkaa naam bhi coca cola express yaa haldiram express aadi kiya ja saktaa he
 Apart from this, some unreserved trains like 'jan Saharan Express' etc
 can be announced along with second class coaches on some popular routes in the Rail Budget
 aam aadmi ko sasti yatra ke liye is prastaav ko aage badhaayaa ja saktaa he
 The Railway Budget will be presented in Parliament on 26 February
 rail bajet 2015-16 main kareeb 20 trainon ke set ke adhigrahan kaa bhi prastaav kiya ja saktaa he
 These trains will run on popular Rajdhani and Shatabdi routes
 bihar main vidhansabha chunaav ke maddenjar vahaan ke liye trainon kii ghoshnaa ho sakati he
 Apart from this, new trains can also be announced for the Northeast
 mana ja rahaa he ki uttar pradesh, oreisha, bengal va gujarat jaise rajyon ke liye nai trainon kii ghoshnaa ke saath kshetreey santulan sthapit karne kaa prayaas kiya jayega
 Re-development of busy stations can also be proposed under Public Private Partnership (PPP) in the Rail Budget

 dilli bijepi ke upaadhyaksh jai prakaash ne ravivaar ko chunaav ayog ko patr likhaa he, jisamen unhone kaha he ki dilli main aam aadmi party dwaara jagah-jagah hordings lagaae gaye hai
 The promises made in these hoardings are completely misleading, it is a violation of the code of conduct
 bijepi ne in hordings ko jald hataane kii maang kii he
 Actually, hoardings have been installed by the Aam Aadmi Party in many places in Delhi, in these hoardings it has been claimed that if Delhi becomes a full state then every Delhiite will be given a house
 dilli police dilli sarkaar ke adhikaar main hogi or dilli ke logon ke liye dilli main reserveshan kiya jayega
 Not only this, these hoardings containing pictures of Arvind Kejriwal have also made many other promises, which will be fulfilled only after Delhi becomes a full state
 dilli bijepi ke upaadhyaksh jai prakaash kaa kahana he ki logon ko gumraah karne vaale vaade karnaa aachaar samhita kaa sidhaa ulanghan he or dilli main arvind kejariwal sarkaar aisa hi kar rahi he
 Delhi state is not an independent state in the constitution but is under the central government

 When Modi was the Chief Minister here, the development that was done here was put in front of the whole country and the whole country made him Prime Minister that Narendra Modi will develop the country
 narendra modi ke pradhanmantri banane ke baad jitne bhi chunaav hue sab vikaas par hue
 Everyone voted for development
 bhartiya janata party jiti or congress ko jad se hataa diya
 That is why the Congress is scared of development

 This time there is a question of the existence of Congress

 Congress is fighting for 25-30 seats

 The opposition unity of the NDA to fight in the ideological battle through the presidential election has been shattered
 nitish kumaar ne endie ummidavaar kaa saath dene kaa elaan kya kiya, congress or vipakshi dalon ko to maano kaato to khun nahin
 After all, the target of this unity is the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and opposition to the ideology of the Union at the Center
 aise main vipaksh or congress ke saamne nitish ne 5 sawaal jarur khadey kar die hai, jinka jawaab usko khojate nahin mil rahaa

 nitish ne endie ke raashtrapati ummidavaar ke samarthan kiya he, jo sangh ke becoground se aate hai
 In such a situation, they will vote against the opposition, then how much will the credibility of the opposition be left when it comes with the opposition later? 2

 Congress and Laluqya, who talk of ideology, will remain in the government under Nitish's leadership in Bihar? After all, where will the question of ideology go? Because, Nitish should give any reason, but he is going against the original opposition's fight

 Will the Opposition be able to dare Nitish to sideline Nitish and return home? Will Nitish be credited as being a partner of NDA? 5

 Uttar Pradesh, the largest state by population, has only one female prison
 central jail kii baat karen to 29 rajya or 7 centre shasit pradeshon main sabase zyada central jail dilli or madhya pradesh main he jahaan donon rajyon main 11-11 central jail hai
 There are 9–9 Central Jails in Maharashtra, Punjab, Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu
 yahaan bhi uttar pradesh kaaphi peeche he or mahaj 5 central jail hai
 According to the NCRB report, as of 31 December 2016, there were 4,33,003 prisoners in 1412 jails of the country
 jabaki in jelon main 3,80,876 kaidiyon ko hi rakhane kii kshamta he
 Talking about Uttar Pradesh, the jails here have 95,336 prisoners while the capacity is just 58,111
 is tarah se upi kii jelon main kshamta se kahin zyada 164

 9 fisadi kaidi hi band hai
 The jails here have a capacity to hold 64 prisoners while only 7 prisoners are closed here

 28 on the basis of percentage
 5 fisadi baithta he
 The jails in 11 states and 5 union territories have fewer prisoners than their total capacity

 The license of the allotted petrol pump has been canceled
 bharat petroleum corporation limited ne saal 2011 main tej pratap yadav ko patna ke bypass ilaake main petrol pump chalaane kaa license diya tha
 In the same case, BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi had alleged that Tej Pratap Yadav had obtained the license of petrol pump in 2011 by fraud and submitting fake documents

 Modi addressed 21 rallies across the state in the last week of the election campaign and poll pollsters believed that this increased BJP votes, giving him an edge over the Gaddisheen Congress
 bhaajapa rajya main 104 siten jitkar sabase badi party ke taur par ubhari, par apane dam par sarkaar banane ke liye jaruri 112 siton ke saadhaaran bahumat se peeche rah gai
 (there are a total of 224 seats in the state assembly, but elections for two seats have been postponed till the end of May)
 modi is baat se jarur maayoos hue honge ki bhaajapa ko mili siten party kii 130 siton kii ummid se kam rah gayi
 But in his victory speech at the new grand headquarters of the BJP in New Delhi, the Prime Minister appeared confident in his decision to form a government in this southern state and get a confidence vote, despite the fractured mandate
 unhone vaayada kiya ki ''bhaajapa karnataka ke vikaas ko kabhi prabhavit nahin hone degi
 He admitted that he was filled with apprehension over language interruption while addressing election meetings in the state, but was happy to see that those fears were unfounded
 unhone fatah ke jazbe ke saath yah bhi kaha, 'vipaksh ne desh main yah dharna bana di thi ki bhaajapa uttar bharat kii party—hindi bolne vaale rajyon ke ek hisse kii party—he
 The people of Karnataka have given a befitting reply to those parties which try to divide us in these (north-south) lines

 Not only this, it was also the last major bastion of the state Congress
 isane desh kii sabase puraani party ko na keval dakshin main apane pair tikaane kii jagah di thi, balki party ko jinda rakhane ke liye dhanabal kii takat muhaiyaa karaane vaala suba bhi mana jaataa tha

 '' duusari chintaa kii baat yah thi ki karnataka kii haar modi kii lokapriyata main giravat kaa sanket hoti or iskaa doorgaami asar rajasthan, chhattisgarh or madhya pradesh ke bhaajapa shasit rajyon main padataa, jahaan is saal ke aakhir main vidhansabha chunaav hone hai or jahaan congress or bhaajapa ke bich sidhi ladaai hogi
 However, the main reason behind this tremendous fight was that chatur-sujan Shah considers Karnataka to be the 'door of the south' for the party
 loksabhaa kii kul 545 siton main se 130 siten dakshin ke paanch rajyon—karnataka, tamilnadu, andhra pradesh, telugana, kerala—or centre shasit pradesh puduccheri—se aati hai
 The BJP currently has just 21 of these seats
 uski sabase zyada maujuudagi karnataka main he, jahaan se use 17 siten mili hai
 The BJP won a total of 282 seats in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections and the 167 Indian seats or 59 per cent of the total seats were contributed by the north Indian states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan
 inamen se kai rajyon main apane 2014 ke pradarshan ko doharaana bhaajapa ke liye mumkin nahin bhi ho saktaa he
 Therefore, the party is expecting South India to compensate for the losses in the Hindi belt and elsewhere
 dakshin main dhaava us game plan kaa hissaa he jis par modi-shah kii jodi 2014 main endie ke gaddi sanbhaalane ke baad se kaam karti aa rahi he
 While Shah has mastered the leadership of a polling booth level network, Modi has diligently connected people with a pan-india appeal
 donon kaa mail votaron ko behatar dhang se siton main badalata he, khaskar is baat ko dekhte hue ki party kaa samarthan aadhaar alag-alag nirvachan kshetron main alag-alag he
 This was particularly evident in the Karnataka election results, where the BJP won a significant number of seats from its rival, despite getting two per cent less votes from the Congress out of the total votes polled
 modi or shah donon ne bhaanp liya tha ki dakshin ke harek rajya kii siyaasi prishthbhumi or us rajya kii pramukh partiyon ke bainks bhaajapa kii tulanaatmak takat ko dekhte hue harek dakshin rajya kii baarikiyaan ek duusare se alahada or khaas hai
 Karnataka was the only exception among these where the BJP emerged as the largest party in 2004 and also formed the government in 2008
 2019 main bhaajapa dakshin kii kul siton kii kam se kam aadhi, yani 65, siten jeetne kii ummid kar rahi he

 In Karnataka, the BJP is confident of reaping the results of the state assembly elections
 rajya main modi ne jahaan bhi chunaav prachaar kiya, vahaan bheed se mili joshili pratikriyaaon se party ko ummid bandhi he ki vah rajya main apni loksabhaa siton main ijapha karegi
 a top BJP leader claims, "in no two states will our strategy be like one and this time we may not win our first seat in Kerala at all, but on the basis of strategic alliance and knowledge-sharing seats We will emerge as the only true national party, especially now that we have almost achieved the goal of Congress Mukt Bharat
