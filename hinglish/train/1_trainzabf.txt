 Surrounded by criticism over the demand for a turning wicket in the four-match series against England, Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni made it clear on Thursday that he asked him to prepare a turn-taking wicket from day one to reduce the role of the toss

 Dhoni expressed his unhappiness at the wicket after winning the first Test at Motera, Ahmedabad
 unhone kaha tha, ‘ham chaahate hai ki curator aisa wicket taiyaar karen jisamen pehle din se gend turn kare
 The Indian captain, however, said that there will be some bounce in the Wankhede Stadium wicket and this will help the fast bowlers of both teams
 unhone kaha, ‘saal ke is samay main mausam thanda rahata he lekin phir bhi yahaan kuch garmi he
 The fast bowlers will get some swing and the wicket will be dry as the match progresses

 Celebrating clothes in a public place comes under the category of obscenity, which is a crime and the BCCI or other person is not allowed to commit the crime
 vishwa cap final se pehle punam ne kaha tha ki vah team india kii jeet par kapade utarkar jashn manaaengi or vah ab bhi is bayaan par kaayam hai
 The model also states that she is awaiting permission from the BCCI to do so
 uskaa kahana he ki vah stadium, khilaadiyon ke dressing room yaa anya kisi bhi jagah apana vaada puraa karne ke liye taiyaar hai
 Legal expert and Supreme Court advocate Dr Vijendra Mahandiyan says that Poonam says that she is waiting for permission for her act
 yah logon ko gumraah karne ke alaava kuch nahin he
 Mehndiyan said, celebrating by undressing can fall under the category of offense under Section 294 of the Indian Penal Code (committing obscene acts in a public place) and no one can allow anyone to commit a crime, whether it is BCCI or someone And

 khabaron ke mutabik, punam haalanki apana yah vaada puraa karne ke liye ek baar bisisiai ko patr likh chuki hai, lekin cricket board ne unki yah maang khaarij kar di
 She is still awaiting permission from the BCCI

 Dhankar said, making such statements or doing this work is socially wrong and no one should make such statements
 ek anya vidhi visheshgy kamalesh jain kaa kahana he ki punam ke bayaan bhadakaau kii shrenee main aate hai or koi bhi vyakti police main iske khilaaf shikaayat darj kara saktaa he
 Kamlesh said, no one is allowed to make inflammatory statements
 koi bhi vyakti iske liye police ke paas shikaayat darj kara saktaa he or aise main punam ko jamaanat karaani pad sakati he, kyonki yah jamaanti aparaadh he
 He said, such statements cannot be taken lightly, as it can have a direct impact on the younger generation

 He is already a 'B category' terrorist, lodged in the police files as a 'fresh' case

" 2001 main aatankwaad se sambandhit vaardaaton main 4,507 se zyada mauton ko dekhte hue yah sankhya bahut maamuli he
 This new upsurge in terrorism is going to be cause for concern

 Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit had extended the period to one month, ignoring the advice of the Delhi Home Secretary to grant parole of 15 days to Manu Sharma, convicted of the Jessica Lal murder case
 gauratlab he ki parole kii avadhi main manu ne kathith taur par niyamon kaa ulanghan kiya tha
 According to information obtained under the Right to Information Act, Siddharth Vashisht alias Manu Sharma, son of Haryana Congress leader Vinod Sharma, was granted parole for one month on September 18, 2009, whereas he had applied for it only 22 days earlier
 manu sharma ne dilli sarkaar se 27 agast 2009 ko teen maah kii parole kaa aagrah kiya tha
 He gave three reasons for this: attending the funeral of his grandmother who died in 2008, caring for his mother's illness and his neglected business interests
 dilli police ne 10 sitambar 2009 ko apni report main kaha, ‘maa kii dekhbhaal ke liye us (manu) kii jarurat nahin he or philhal company kaa kaarobaar uske bina nirantar chal rahaa he
 The grounds given by him are not such that he can be granted parole

 Manu again approached the Delhi government on 7 October 2007 and requested to extend his parole period, which was accepted within 14 days
 dilli ke uparajyapal ne 21 oktober ko kaarobaar or sambandhit gatividhiyon ke naam par manu ko parole kii manjuuri de di
 The Delhi High Court has pulled up the government for granting parole to Manu Sharma at 'extremely fast' and preferential treatment of convicts with high contacts
 nyaayamurti kailash gambhir ne kaha tha ki saamaanya maamalon main sarkaar kisi doshi ke parole aavedan par faisla karne main teen se chah maah kaa samay leti he lekin manu sharma ke maamle main usne uski yachika ko 20 dinon ke bheetar nipta diya

 If the BJP is successful in winning the hearts of the workers, then leaving the support of the Left, the BJP can make a good dent in the large number of workers currently standing with Mamta's TMC
 pashchim bengal main to sirf chaay bagaanon main hi chaar lakh se zyada majdoor kaam karte hai

 Anil Jain, Ashok Vajpayee, Kanta Kardam, Vijay Pal Singh Tomar, Drs
 harnath singh yadav, sakaladeep rajbhar or jiviel narsimha ke saath 9wein ummidavaar ke taur par anil agarwal ne jeet darj kii he
 Anil Aggarwal got 33 votes while Bhimrao Ambedkar got 32 votes in the exciting contest till the end
 is tarah bijepi ne nauveen seat par bhi jeet darj kii or anil agarwal ne maari baaji
 However, the BJP had to try a lot to win this victory
 aaie jaanate hai bijepi adhyaksh amit shah or siem yogi adityanath ne kaise taiyaar kii jeet kii achook ranneeti or bijepi ke ganit se kaise badalata rahaa rajyasabha chunaav ke din bhar kaa ghatnakram:do vidhayakon se vot na karanautar pradesh main rajyasabha chunaav main voting se chand ghante pehle sapa ke saath-saath basapa ko bhi tagada jhatka laga
 The Allahabad High Court has banned the voting of BSP MLA Mukhtar Ansari
 udhar, jail main band sapa vidhayak hariom yadav ko bhi prashasan ne vot daalane ijaajat nahin di he
 The mobilization of the opposition in the face of two mlas not being able to vote got a shock
 yah yogi sarkaar kii taraf se master stroke sabit hua
 Had it been 2 votes, the SP and the BSP would have easily won 2 seats
 aapako bataa den ki shuukravaar ko ho rahe rajyasabha chunaav main vot daalane ke liye nichali court se anumati mili thi
 At the same time, Mukhtar was also allowed to cast his vote from Ghazipur's Gangster Court last evening
 lekin upi sarkaar kii arji par elahabaad hoicourt ne roak laga di
 a single bench of Justice Rajul Bhargava has prohibited Mukhtar from casting his vote
 jail main band kaidi ko vot dene kaa adhikaar nahin hone ke aadhaar par roak lagaai gai he
 This strategy also went in favor of BJP
 cross voting ke liye donon pakshon kii taraf se koshish hui
 BJP was also shocked when it came to know that Kailash Nath Sonkar, MLA of bjp's ally Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party, has done cross voting
 haalanki bijepi ne sapa or basapa ko jhatka dete hue sapa ke nitin agarwal or basapa ke anil singh ke vot ko apane paksh main dalava liya
 According to Satish Mishra, another BSP MLA voted in favor of BJP
 chunaav khatm hone ke baad bispi netaa satish mishra ne bataaya ki bijepi ne unke do vidhayakon ko agava kar liya tha
 Before the elections, there were reports that BSP MLA Anil Singh met BJP mlas on Thursday
 anil singh ke alaava do or bispi vidhayak bijepi ke sampark main the
 Anil Singh was also seen in the Legislature Party meeting held at the Chief Minister's residence
 aise main pehle se ashanka thi ki chunaavon main cross voting ho sakati he
 Anil Singh is an MLA from Unnao's Purva Assembly
 pehle bhi bijepi ke kareeb rahe hai
 Fought and won elections from BSP when BJP did not get tickets
 9wein ummidavaar ke liye takat laganabijepi jaanati thi ki unke 8 ummidavaar aasaani se jeet jaaenge
 This was the reason that he gave all the strength to his last candidate Anil Aggarwal
 bijepi ne 9wein ummidavaar ke rup main anil agarwal ko rajyasabha bhejne kaa faisla kiya tha
 Keeping in mind the original votebank Vaishya community of the BJP, Agarwal was nominated by the party
 agarwal kaa pashchim uttar pradesh main ejineering or management college hai
 In such a situation, the BJP decided the victory of its last candidate with the remaining 28 additional votes and the votes obtained by cross voting
 aakhir tak romaanchak rahe mukaable main anil agarwal ko 33 jabaki bhimrao ambedkar ko 32 vot mili
 In this way, BJP also won the ninth seat and Anil Aggarwal won
 yogi kii sakriyata- vidhayakon ko demo dena, saath meeting karnaais chunaav main bijepi kii jeet isse bhi tay hui ki bijepi se kisi ne bhi cross voting nahin kii
 This was followed by the hard work of UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath
 upi ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ne chunaav se pehle shuukravaar kii subah party vidhayakon se mulaakaat kii, unke saath upmukhyamantri dinesh sharma bhi saath the
 At the same time, UP Pradesh President Dr
 mahendranath pandeya ne basapa or congress se bijepi main aae mantriyon se mulaakaat kar cross voting kii ranneeti tay kii
 Along with this, Yogi also celebrated the mlas who were angry with the party along with Amit Shah
 amit shah ke mulaakaat ke baad rajbhar bhi maan gaye
 Along with this, Yogi also worked to help the independents
 is vajah se nirdaleey vidhayak aman mani or nishad party ke vijay mishra ke vot bijepi pratyaashee ke paksh main gaya
 This strategy of Yogi overshadowed the joint strategy of SP and BSP
 plan bi bhi kiya taiyaradinabhar main aisa ek bhi vakt nahin aayaa jab bijepi apane 9wein ummidavaar ko vijayi banane main peeche hati ho
 The BJP convened an emergency meeting after the BSP and SP objected to cross voting in the Rajya Sabha
 saath hi aage kii ranneeti bhi tay kii
 Let me tell you that in Uttar Pradesh, the Election Commission stopped the counting of votes after objecting to ballot paper
 aarope tha ki nitin agarwal or anil singh ne apane vot othrise agent ko nahin dikhaae
 The BSP has complained to the Election Commission and that is why the counting has been stopped
 bispi or sapa ne donon vidhayakon ke vot ko radd karne kii maang kii thi
 Counting resumed only after the commission's next order
 bijepi kii ranneeti kii vajah se counting ke dauraan chunaav ayog kaa faisla aayaa or bijepi or bispi vidhayakon ke 1-1 vot radd kar die gaye

 Now everyone's eyes are on the Varanasi Lok Sabha seat of Uttar Pradesh
 baba bhole nath kii ye nagari desh kii sabase viipi seat he kyonki yahaan ke saansad pradhanmantri narendra modi hai
 PM Modi won here in 2014 and now once again is in the field from this place
 2014 main jab narendra modi gujarat kii raajnneeti chhod desh kii raajnneeti karne nikle to unhone apane debyue ke liye kaashi ko hi chunaa
 Because cultivation was for the whole country, it was necessary for him to cultivate Uttar Pradesh and Bihar
 modi varanasi aae to har har modi-ghar ghar modi kaa naaraa 2014 main khub gunja, modi ne bhi kaha ki unhen kisi ne bheja nahin he balki maa ganga ne unhen bulaayaa he
 This talk of Modi remained with him for 5 years
 pichhali baar dikhaaya tha damapahali baar jab modi ne varanasi se namakan kiya, to najaara bhavy tha
 From BHU to the place of filing of nominations, there was a road show of Narendra Modi and on that day it was as if the entire Kashi had become saffron
 varanasi se ladane ke matlab sirf ek seat hi nahin hota he, balki isse purvanchal or bihar tak sandesh jaataa he
 That roadshow of Modi had turned the wave into a tsunami, the BJP is trying to do the same this time
 26 april ko narendra modi kaa kaashi se namakan he, aise main taiyaari puri he
 This time too, there is a road show, there is worship in the temple, there is a program of Ganga Aarti, meaning the view is going to be completely grand
 chunauti dene pahunche the kai diggaugar 2014 kii baat karen to jab narendra modi ne kaashi se ladane kii thaanee to har kisi kii najar vahaan daudi
 And there was a line of fighters against him, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal also fought against him then but he had to face defeat
 2014 ke chunaav main modi ko yahaan 5 lakh se adhik vot mili or duusare number par rahe arvind kejariwal ko kareeb 2 lakh, vahiin congress ke ajay raay tisare number par rahe the
 This time too many in the field, this time too, there are no less who are going to take the field against the PM, this time there are many candidates of political parties besides former judge, farmer of Tamil Nadu
 yahaan tak ki is baar congress mahasachiv priyanka gandhi wadra ke bhi varanasi se chunaav ladane kii charchaaen joro par hai, matlab ladaai dilachasp hi hogi
 During the last 5 years, Narendra Modi visited Kashi many times while being PM, many foreign guests also visited Varanasi and tried to identify Kashi on the world stage
 modi kaa kahana he ki unhen kaashi ko viraasat ko chede bina use aadhunik banane kaa kaam kiya he, virodhiyon kaa kahana he ki modi ne kaashi kii saanskrithik viraasat ko thes pahunchaai he

 Arvind Kejriwal's credibility rests on the Delhi Municipal Corporation elections in the event of defeat despite claiming heavy victories in Goa and Punjab
 aise siyaasi kayaas lagaae ja rahe hai ki nigam chunaav haarane kii sthiti main ve siyaasi bavandar main funs sakate hai
 According to reliable sources of the Aam Aadmi Party, now they will take charge of these elections themselves
 itnaa hi nahin party sutron kaa kahana he ki ve ab tak baante gaye tikaton par punarvichaar kar sakate hai
 However, in the list of 200 candidates released so far, mostly party workers are there
 inamen se adhikansh kaaryakarta vahiin hai jo party kii shuruyaat se hi arvind kejariwal ke saath jude rahe hai
 In such a situation, the election of MCD has become a nose question for BJP as well as Aam Aadmi Party
 aam aadmi party bhi ab kisi tarah kii kotahi nahin baratna chaahati
 Perhaps this is the reason why Arvind Kejriwal himself is ready to take charge of the MCD elections
 ve chunaav prachaar ke saath-saath tikat vitaran main bhi khaasi ruchi le rahe hai
 They are keeping an eye on all the preparations of the party and will also give full publicity
 yahaan ham bataate chalem kiam aadmi partiko punjab se kaaphi ummiden thim
 The party felt that they would win the Punjab elections and this wave would also help them in the Municipal Corporation of Delhi elections but this could not happen
 dilli nagar nigam main satta virdohi lahar kaa saamana kar rahi bijepi paanch rajyon ke vidhansabha chunaav ke nateezon se gadgad he
 They believe that they are in direct fight with the Aam Aadmi Party
 dilli kii lambey samay tak satta sanbhaalane valicongressunaav ko trikoniya banane kii jaddojahad main lagi he
 In such a situation, another election defeat has the potential to raise questions on the political future of the Aam Aadmi Party

 The more the Arvind Kejriwal government of Delhi and the Aam Aadmi Party are trying to run away from the controversies, the more it gets entangled in it
 ab nayaa maamla iskar vibhaag kii ore se saamne aayaa he
 Department officials say that Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party has failed to account for the two crore rupees received during the 2015 elections
 party iskar vibhaag ko yah nahin bataa pai he ki yah daan kahaan se aayaa
 Only last week, the party has been asked by the Ministry of Home Affairs to give information about donations received from foreign countries
 centre ke is prakaar ke aadesh par bhi dilli sarkaar ke siem 49 varshiya arvind kejariwal ne kaha ki yah party ko badnaam karne kii sajeesh he
 Arvind Kejriwal is also facing difficulties in the party after the recent MCD elections in Delhi and earlier defeats in Punjab and Goa elections
 tippaniyan First, there were reports from poet Kumar Vishwas that he was angry with the party
 phir unhen manaa liya gaya
 After this, Kapil Mishra, one of the seven ministers, was dismissed by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal
 agle hi din mantri ne kejariwal par satyendra jain se avaidh rup se do karod rupee lene kaa aarope laga diya
 Now Kapil Mishra has filed a complaint in the ACB and CBI
 is puure maamle main pehle to kejariwal kaaphi samay tak chuppi saadhe rahe phir beeti raat unhone kaha ki sachai kii jeet hogi
 Even on this type of order of the Center, 49-year-old Arvind Kejriwal, CM of Delhi Government, said that this is a conspiracy to defame the party
 haal ke dilli main hue emsidi chunaav or isse pehle punjab or goa ke chunaav main mili haar ke baad arvind kejariwal ko party main bhi dikkaton kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he

 Then he was persuaded
 iske baad saat mantriyon main se ek kapil mishra ko mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne barkhaast kar diya
 The very next day, the minister accused Kejriwal of illegally taking Rs 2 crore from Satyendar Jain
 ab kapil mishra ne maamalon kii shikaayat asibi or sibiai main darj kara di he
 In this whole case, Kejriwal kept silence for a long time, then last night he said that truth will prevail

 In the eyes of Bihar Police and Administration, people fighting against terrorism have no value and importance
 isiilie do durdaant aatankwaadiyon ko pakadvane vaale anuraag basu ko mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ek prashasti patr or mahaj 3500 rupee dekar panna jhaad lete hai
 The Bihar police also do not want to give full credit to Anurag, the mastermind of the Ahmedabad serial blasts, for apprehending these very dangerous terrorists and that is why the charge sheet did not even mention Anurag
 itnaa hi nahin anuraag ne 'ajtak' ko bataaya ki ulte police use 120bi main fansaane kii dhamkee bhi detii rahati he
 Anurag, who caught the terrorists masterminded by killing 56 people at his own life, is no longer happy with the police
 aapako bataa den ki gaya kaa rahane vaala anuraag sibar cafe chalaata he or marshall art main trend he
 He did not even know that he was a dreaded terrorist who was involved in 21 serial blasts at 16 places in Ahmedabad in 2008, when he caught two people who had come to his cyber café, risking their lives in the hands of the police
 anuraag kii bahaduree or sajagata ke hi chalate police ne na sirf pathan tawsiff or sanne khan jaise durdaant aatankwaadiyon ko giraftaar kiya, balki tawsiff se mili input ke aadhaar par desh bhar se 10 durdaant aparaadhiyon ko pakadaney main bhi madad mili thi
 a reward of over Rs 10 lakh was also declared on these criminals
 aapako bataa den ki ATS, NIA sahit tamaam khufia agenciyon ko pichley 10 saal se donon durdaant aatankwaadiyon kii talash thi, jinhen pichley saal 13 sitambar ko anuraag kii bahaduree or sajagata ke chalate giraftaar kiya ja sakaa
 Police has filed a charge sheet against both the terrorists on March 10, but the police charge sheet neither mentions Anurag nor his cyber cafe from where both the terrorists were arrested
 is tarah pakade gaye the aatankvadisadharan sa sibar cafe chalaane vaale anuraag ke jehan main kahin na kahin dilli police dwaara jari 10 aatankwaadiyon kii tasviir chaspa rah gai thi
 On September 13, 2017, when the two terrorists came to her cyber café, their suspicious activities raised doubts in her mind
 usne apni samajhadaari se na sirf donon ko kaaphi der tak sibar cafe main hi fansaae rakhaa, balki marshall art main maahir anuraag ne jab dekha ki police aane main der kar rahi he or sandigdh bhaagane lage to usne apni jaan par khelkar donon ko akele hi dhar dabocha
 Even the Telangana police took the hard disk of 4 computers of Anurag's cyber café, on the basis of which 4 lakh prize Abdul Subhan Qureshi from Delhi, 10 lakh prize Mohammad Prophet Shaikh from Siliguri and 10 lakh prize money Mohammad Kamruddin succeeded in arresting him from Murshidabad
 inaam ke bajaay mili sajyanurag ko jahaan itane durdaant aatankwaadiyon ko pakadvane kaa inaam milanaa chahie tha, vahiin ab uski roji-roti ke bhi laale pad gaye hai
 The cyber café that led to the arrest of the two terrorists is now closed
 anuraag ko samaj nahin aa rahaa ki vah kare to kya kare
 Anurag told 'aaj Tak' that i had worked in the country interest
 lekin ab meraa bura haal he
 What to do in the interest of the country so that our own livelihood is stopped
 meraa apana ghar bhi nahin he
 The house is on rent and the shop was also on rent

 Whether the police station president or DSP
 mujhase kaha gaya ki aword yaa reword kii maang kii to 120bi lagaakar andar kar diya jaaoongaa
 The police themselves want to take all the credit for catching both the terrorists
 anuraag kaa kahana he ki vah ek aam naagarik he, isliye uske saath aisa kiya ja rahaa he
 The award or award is not even mentioned in the chargesheet
 1 farvari ko CGM ke yahaan meraa jo bayaan liya gaya, uskaa tak zikr nahin he
 The police say that the local people of Gaya are also invoices in the terrorists network
 is tarah to mujhe hi jaan kaa khatra ban gaya he
 i do not deserve to live here and i do not have enough money to go to any other place
 police bana rahi dabainurag ne bataaya ki police us par bayaan badalane kaa dabaav bana rahi he
 The police told him not to give such a statement that the police arrived late
 bas yah bolnaa he ki aatankwaadi ko pakadakar handover kiya
 The police is showing me fear of life threat
 ab to meraa sibar cafe kaa dhandha bhi band ho gaya he
 The people who used to work with me, fear of the police and terrorists also left
 main unke ghar par bhi gaya ki chalo bhai kaam karo, lekin aatank ke dar se ve kaam nahin kar rahe
 The arrival of customers also stopped

 Even Anurag has not yet been given the right reward for his bravery
 bihar aties ke dspi ne 10 march kochargeshitcourt main daakhil kii he, usamen anuraag kaa koi zikr nahin he
 When Aaj Tak asked him in this regard, he says that it is not needed in the charge sheet
 lekin hakeekat yahi he ki aword yaa reword chargeshit ke aadhaar par hi tay hote hai
 However, a letter came on 8 December on behalf of MGR, the Prime Minister and the Home Minister, stating that Anurag should be given financial assistance, security and other benefits
 lekin anuraag ko ab tak isamen se kuch bhi nahin mila he

 com / xechwrfra7 The much talked-about interview of Raj Thackeray and Sharad Pawar took place three months after the announcement was finally made
 is intervyuu ke dauraan ensipi pramukh sharad pavaar ne maharashtra navnirmaan sena pramukh raaj thakare se kaha ki 1999 main unke congress chhodane kii vajah sonia gandhi thim
 Pawar said that Sonia wanted to become Prime Minister when the contender for the post was either Manmohan Singh or himself
 unhone is ghatana ko yaad kiya or bataaya, 'main ghar par tha or media report se pataa chalaa ki sonia gandhi sarkaar banane kaa daawa pesh karne ja rahi hai
 Manmohan Singh or i were reasonable contenders for the post of PM
 usee samay maine congress chhodane kaa faisla kar liya
 In this 150-minute meeting, Raj Thackeray tried to know about Sharad Pawar's journey of 50 years of state, social, agriculture, sports and cultural life
 vaise dekha jaae, to november 2017 main is vishesh baatcheet kii ghoshnaa BVG group ke founder diarector hanumant gaekwad ne kii thi
 The meeting was scheduled to take place on January 6, but it was canceled for some time due to the Bhima Koregaon violence
 dabaav mahasoos kar rahe the thakareyah bahucharchit mulaakaat pune ke BMCC college ke maidan par hui
 It was organized by Jagatik Marathi Academy
 is dauraan 'shodh marathi man kaa' vishay par charchaa hui
 Many people liked the style of Raj Thackeray and his style of talking bluntly
 yuva netaa raaj thakare ne varisht netaa sharad pavaar kaa haath pakadakar unako manch par laae
 Raj Thackeray made it clear at the beginning of the conversation that today he is feeling a lot of pressure
 isaki vajah unhone genershan gap bataaya
 Difficult to tell the truth, keep quiet Raj Thackeray asked Sharad Pawar if he ever faced difficulties due to telling the truth? Sharad Pawar smilingly replied that in politics one has to tell the truth, but where speaking can cause difficulties, one should not speak
 samaaj main daraar se chintaraj thakare ne poocha ki maharashtra ke kis sawaal par unhen chintaa mahasoos hoti he, is par pavaar ne kaha ki rajya main saamaajik or jaateey ekajutata main ai daraar unhen sataati he
 Because of this, there is growing malice among societies and this is not good for the state
 narendra modi ke bare main raipiem narendra modi ke bare main sharad pavaar kii pehle kya raay thi or ab kya raay he? is par sharad pavaar ne kaha ki unhen subah jaldi uthne kii acchhee aadat he, taiyaar hone kii aadat he or bahut mehnat karne kii aadat he
 Laughing at this answer, Raj said that he too is starting to get up early, but can anyone become the Prime Minister of the country by doing this? What will Rahul bring to Sharad Pawar about Congress' good day Rahul Gandhi? To this, Sharad Pawar replied that there has been a lot of difference in the functioning of the former Rahul and this time Rahul
 rahul gandhi aage badhate rahe to nishchit rup ke desh kii janata unhen sweekaar karegi or congress ke liye achche din aaenge
 Running the country, not running Gujarat Sharad Pawar questioned Modi's leadership and said that there is a difference between running a state like Gujarat and running the country
 gujarat ke kone-kone kii jaankaree aapako ho sakati he lekin jab desh kii baat aati he tab aapaki team main har rajya ko jaanane vaala vyakti hona jaruri he
 Rank did not know when he became the Minister of Defense, Thewar told a story that when he became the Defense Minister of the country, he did not know the ranks of the officers of the Indian Army, Air Force and Navy
 bina sharmaate hue pavaar ne bataaya ki kaise unhone ritred afasaron se ye baarikiyaan sikhin or aage bade
 It is not necessary that every person should know everything, but to run the country, it is important to learn all things
 unhone kaha ki rahul gandhi nai baaten seekhney kii koshish kar rahe hai
 The commissioners of Yashwant Rao and Bal Thackeray said that Yashwant Rao Chavan of the state enhanced the prestige of Maharashtra in the country and abroad, he lacked
 iske alaava bala sahib thakare kii bhi kami mahasoos hoti he
 Sharad Pawar on Dawood Sharad Pawar clarified for the first time on Dawood's case
 unhone kaha ki unpar kai aarope lage, par ve kisi ise mahatv nahin dete hai
 Everyone says that Dawood and Sharad Pawar have a relationship, but there is no fact in it

 puure nau din or do sau ghante baad wo donon maut ko maat dekar kabr se jinda baahar nikal aae
 Yes, we are talking about the same tunnel in Bilaspur in Himachal Pradesh in which three lives were stuck for the last nine days
 par oparation zindagi abhi puraa nahin hua he kyonki abhi ek or jindagi ko bachaana baaki he
 He is yet to be taken out of the same grave from which the remaining two were taken out alive on Monday
 tarakkee kii daud main vakt se aage nikalne main lage insaan ko beete 12 sitambar kohimachal ke bilaspur menmaujood pahadiyon main tab joardaar jhatka laga, jab tihra main ban rahi ek surang main chattan or mitti ke dhansane se achaanak hi teen majdoor andar funs gaye
 The construction of a tunnel of about one and a half kilometers was going on near Panoh on the kiratpur-nerchauk Fourlane Highway in Bilaspur
 12 sitambar ko raat kareeb saadhe aath baje nirmaanadhin tunnel main kaam kar rahe mazdooron kii shift badal rahi thi
 At that time 16 workers were working inside the tunnel
 in 16 main se 13 log to shift badalane par baahar aa gaye lekin, isse pehle ki baaki bache teen majdoor baahar aa pate ki tabhi achaanak tunnel ke andar ek haadasa hua or surang kii 25 feet oonchi chat se dher sara malba gira or teenon mazdoor, satish kumaar, mani ram or hday ram surang ke andar hi funs gaye
 After spending four days in the dark tunnel of death, he finally came to life on Monday, when life gave proof of his being alive
 haalanki is khushi ke bich baichaiyn karanevaali ek baat ye he ki teen main se ek majdoor hridyaram kaa ab bhi koi pataa nahin chalaa he
 This rescue operation, which went on day and night for the last 9 days in Bilaspur, may have been successful in evacuating two laborers alive, but no news has yet been revealed about the third laborer, Hridayram
 ye or baat he ki hridyaram ko baahar nikaal lene se pehle jila prashasan or andiaref ne apana oparation band naa karne kaa faisalaa kiya he
 In this joint operation of NDRF, Satluj Jal Vidyut Nigam Limited, Border Road Organization and Himachal Pradesh Power Corporation Limited, the experts left no stone unturned to win and eventually won
 lekin ek majdoor hridyaram ke milane tak ye koshish philhal adhuri hi he
 There is a strange coincidence with this charismatic news of beating death
 ek aisa ittefaq jisane naa sirf andhere tunnel main fanse in do mazdooron ko puure nau dinon tak behad mushkil halaat main jinda rahane kaa jajba diya, balki ye bhi bataaya ki chattani iraadon ke aage mushkilen kaise choti ban jaati hai
 In fact, Satish, who was trapped in the tunnel, was not only trapped in one such tunnel earlier, but had already spent about six to seven days in such a difficult situation
 tab satish kullu ke barsnehi ilaake main surang banane vaali ek team kaa member tha or tab bhi badakismati se wo tunnel ke raste main malba girane se funs chukaa tha
 But he still gave proof of his rocky spirits and this time too
 is rescue oparation main lage logon kii maane to ye satish hi tha, jisane naa sirf hausala nahin choda, balki apane saath fanse maniram ko bhi lagaataar hausala detaa rahaa
 
 
 And somewhere behind his lofty intentions, his previous experience also proved to be an important reason
 
 
 yahi vajah he ki jab andiaref ke jawan somvaar ko pehali baar andar pahunche, to satish ne pehle apane saathi maniram ko baahar nikalne diya or tab khud baahar aayaa

 No government can afford to drown banks but the provisions of the (frdi-financial Resolution and Deposit Insurance) Bill 2017 are a surprise to 52, which says that banks or financial companies, if in crisis, can use their liabilities ie liability
 (bell in)
 jamakartaon (dipogiters) kaa paisa isamen shaamil he haalanki jise diposit ko insurance ke tahat rakhaa gaya he vah is prakriya se baahar rahegaa
 As per the existing rules, the maximum insurance on whatever bank deposit is there is only one lakh rupees
 is praavdhaan kii bhashaa kharaab he, sandarbh bhi uljhe hai, iske lagu hone kii koi sambhaavna nahin he
 The government is giving clarification but fear is there
 khauf kii buniyadi vajah yah he ki chuninda logon kii aarthik aniyamittaaon ke liye samuhik dand dene ke prayog kuch zyada hi hone lage hai
 Last year, the entire country was punished due to black money of some people in demonetisation
 bade karjadaaron par bakaayaa bainkon kii samasya he lekin samaadhaan kii koshishen aam logon ko daraa raheen hai
 The trouble of Indian banking is unique
 chuninda bade karjadaar iskaa sankat hai
 Some have been hit by business mistakes, some have deliberately defrauded banks and some have drowned in recession
 bainkon ke 86 fisadi fanse hue karj (jienpie-8
 29 lakh crore Rs
 ) bade karjadaaron ke naam hai
 But there are depositors in awe which is small savings (rs 150 lakh crore)
 ) se desh kii vittiya ridh banaate hai
 There are only two options for salvaging banks: one can either raise the taxpayer's money by lending it to the banks (giving capital to the banks from the budget i
e
 bail out) or damage the depositors' savings
 'bel-in' praavdhaan sujhata he ki bainkon ko bajet yani tex ke paise se ubaarana galat he
 Those who do business (investment or deposit) from banks should bear this burden, that is, the common people will cut the knife in some way
 banking kii duvidha kaa ilaaj 'bel in', 'bel out' yaa 'hair cat' (bainkon ke puunji va munaafe main kami) nahin he
 Currently, the banking scenario needs three major structural reforms
 udaarikaran ko 25 saal biit chuke hai
 The funding structure of projects should be changed
 badi pariyojnaon ke liye bank karjon par nirbharta kam karnaa jaruri he
 Companies should take market capital and debt on their credit
 bainkon ke liye chote upabhokta karj behatar hai, jinaki vasuuli ko lekar samasya nahin he
 Equity culture will make companies transparent
 aam logon ko bachat va nivesh ke nae maukey hasil honge or jokhim bhare bank karj kam honge
 Banks will have to increase non-deposit sources of resources
 pichhali sadi tak america main bainkon ke adhikansh sansaadhan diposit se aate the
 Banks, respectively, began to raise resources from the Federal Reserve through debt and capital and bond markets
 ab aadhe sansaadhan gaiyr diposit hai
 This has also reduced the cost of bank resources, reducing risks for depositors
 jamakartaon ko behatar beemaa suraksha milani chahie jisaki laagat unase lee ja sakati he
 The contradiction in the government's perspective on banks is scaring people
 pehle bank main sona rakhkar (gold monetigeshan) nakad lene ke liye kaha gaya, phir notebandi ho gai
 Attempts to connect the poor with the bank (jan Dhan) have been the biggest victims of this
 bank kaa ek arth vishwaas bhi hota he jo yun hi nahin he
 Banks are the first and last base of people's trust in an economy
 har desh kii banking kaa mizaaj alag he
 The first rights on banks in India belong to crores of depositors, most of whom never take loans
 karj lene vaale banking kaa jaruri hissaa hai lekin chota-sa hai
 If the government wants more and more people to join banks or stay connected, then it will not have to do anything that makes the foundation of the banks in India, that is, the depositors
 banking ke saath ek seemaa se zyada jokhim visphotak ho saktaa he
 The fear of banks sinking in India is out of the question, but not everyone should be punished for the mistake of some people
 champion cricketer sachin tendulkar kerala main lakjri vila kharidne kii soch rahe hai
 Sources said that Tendulkar, the owner of the Kerala Blasters team in Indian Super League football, has preferred a villa in the backwater area here

 He responded to Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chaudhary's claim that if the government did not sign the RCEP at Sonia Gandhi's request, then why did the Congress not listen to Sonia Gandhi while signing the Bali Accord in 2013?

 haratalika tijka mahatv- is vrath koharitalika tijbhi kehete hai aurhartalika tijbhi- is vrath kaa sambandh bhagwaan shiv se he- 'har' shiv kaa naam he, isliye is vrath kaa namahartalika tijzyada upyukt mana gaya he- bhadrapada shukla kii tritiya tithi ko manaaya jaataa haiharatalika tijka parv, is din mahilaayein nirjal vrath rakhane kaa sankalp leti hai- mukhya rup se ye parv manachaahe or yogya pati kii kaamana ke liye rakhaa jaataa he
 However any woman can keep this fast - this time Haritalika Teej will be celebrated on 24th august
it is also believed that in order to get Lord Shiva as a husband, mother Parvati did severe penance in the forest for years
 bina jal or bina aahaar ke tap karne ke baad unhen bhagwaan shiv ne patni rup main sweekaar kiya tha
 That is why women attach special importance to loyalty and penance on the day of Haritalika Teej
 jaaniye ki kya he is vrath kii uttam vidhi or kaise miltaa he is vrath kaa purna fal- subah sankalp lekar nirjal upwas rakhana chahie
 But if your health is not good, you can keep a fast on fruits - in the evening, worship Lord Shiva and Parvati jointly, keep in mind that women should remain in full adornment at the time of worship - after this, offer good fortune to Goddess Parvati and Pray for the fulfillment of your wishes from them - Married women should take blessings from their mother-in-law on this day by giving them good luck - Bhag Parayan of knowledge Shiva and mother as the vow after the joint worship of Parvati in-hrtalika Tijke day-night awakening is particularly Shubkari loksabhaa chunaav-2019 main machhlipattanam seat par YSR congress ke vallabhneni balashori ne paracham laharaaya

 vittiya kshetra bhi sthir he, lekin chook kii dar adhik hone se bankig pranali prabhavit hui he
 According to the index, India ranked 15th in terms of company operations, second in shareholder operations and third in market size and renewable energy regulation
 navonmesh ke maamle main bhi bharat kaa pradarshan anya ubhartee arthvyavasthaaon se behatar rahaa or viksit deshon ke samatuly rahaa
 However, poor performance in the adoption of Information, Communication and Technology (ICT), poor health and medical conditions, and poor rate of healthy living prospects limited the impact of good performance in many areas

 It is alleged that the institution presented a false report to the Indian Nursing Council for the study of GNM in Nawadih Kalan area of the minister's constituency of Vishrampur, on the basis of which the institution was allowed to study GNM while in reality a hospital could run at that place
 Has not been the same
 aspataal ke liye building jarur bani he lekin abhi usamen kaaphi kaam baaki he
 According to the claim of Sohari Chandravanshi Hospital at Bishrampur in Palamu district, the 100-bed hospital has been operating here for the last four months
 yahaan marijon kaa ilaaj bhi hone ke daawey kiye ja rahe hai
 Something similar also says the report of the then Civil Surgeon cum District Registry Authority of the district
 jinhone 28 april 2016 main sanstha kii report par muhar lagaate hue kaha tha ki unhone training college chalaane laayak sabhi suvidhaon ko bhautik nirikshan kar sahi paaya
 The report says that the hospital has 100 beds, necessary equipment and doctors
 isi report ke aadhaar par nursing counsil ne aspataal ko saal 2016-17 ke liye college kholane kii anumati di thi
 In fact, in its application to the nursing council in February, the secretary of the institution had sought permission to study GNM, in which he said that the institution has a 100-bed hospital
 vahin sthaneey log aise kisi bhi aspataal ke hone kii baat nakaar rahe hai
 According to the conditions prescribed for the study of GNM, it is necessary to have a 100-bed hospital in the conditions prescribed for the study of GNM
 yadi aisa nahin he to college aas-paas ke kinhin teen aspataalon se apni sambhddhata darshaate hue iskaa daawa kar saktaa he
 Provided that this hospital is within a radius of 15 to 30 km from the college
 pahari kshetron main yah duuri 50 kilometre tak ho sakati he
 According to the guidelines, 75 percent of the hospital beds should be filled with patients
 in aspataalon main ICU, ICCU, miner yaa major oparation theatre, gaini, bacchon ke ward, haddi rog, dental, neuro or ENT ke ilaaj kii suvidha honi chahie
 While nothing like this was found in the hospital
 vipaksh ke nishane par swasthya mantriaise main palamu ke purv saansad kameshwar baitha kaa kahana he ki yah saraasar farjivada he
 However, he also said that there is a dire need of a hospital in this area
 vahin swasthya mantriji kaa kahana he ki sab ho kaam rahe hai ramchandra chandravanshi welfare trust ne palamu jile ke kai jagahon par shaikshanik santhaan khol rakhe hai
 In which academic, vocational and technical education is given
 inamen se adhiktar santhaan vishrampur sthit ek hi parisar main hai
 Being a SC / ST dominated area, the students studying here also get crores of scholarships
 vahin aarope he ki jienem kii padhai shuru hone se sanstha ko kaaphi aarthik laabh hoga
 Film Name: bazardirector: Gaurav Ke Chawlastar Cast: Saif Ali Khan, Chitrangada Singh, Rohan Mehra, Radhika Apte Duration: 2 hours 20 minutes Certificates: u / a Rating: 3
 5 stargaurav ke chawla kaa naam vigyaapan kii industry main prasiddh he lekin pehali baar unhone film diarection main kadam rakhaa he
 Gaurav has tried to show the ups and downs of the stock market and the things that are going on around that world, through the market film, let's know how this film is finally made
 kahani:film kii kahani mumbai ke udyogpati shakun kothaari (saf ali khan) se shuru hoti he jo khud ko share bazaar kaa king maanata he
 Shakun's wife is Mandira Kothari (chitrangada Singh)
 shakun ke saath ke vyapaaree usase isliye jalte hai kyonki uske kaam karne kaa tarika sabase alag he
 Meanwhile, Rizwan Ahmed (rohan Mehra), who trades from Allahabad city, is in Mumbai
 uskaa ek hi sapana hota he, shakun kothaari se ek baar milanaa
 During this, Rizwan meets Priya (radhika Apte), who works in a trading company
 rigwan kaa shakun se milanaa or milane se pehle or uske baad main tarah-tarah kii ghatnaon kaa ghatana bhi ek dilachasp vaakye he
 In the end, the story reaches a different point, to know that you will have to watch the film
 film ko kyon dekh sakate hai:film kii kahani badi dilachasp he or khaastaur se iskaa screenple kamaal kaa he
 i do not know when the interval comes while watching the film
 film ke samvaad bhi kaaphi dilachasp he, jisaki vajah se aseem aroda, nikhil adwani ,or parvej shaikh kii tarif jarur hoti he
 The way in which the film moves forward is quite interesting
 ham kah sakate hai ki pehali baar film kaa diarection kar rahe gaurav ke chawla badhai ke paatr hai bahut hi acha diarection kiya he
 The stock market research is also well appreciated
 jis insaan ko share market ke bare main bilkul nahin pataa uske liye bhi yah film dekhni aasaan ho jaati he
 There is a different kind of style to portray the film
 jo ki kaaphi stylish bhi he or use aap theatre tak ja kar hi feel kar paaenge
 How is the performance of the characters: Saif Ali Khan has given an equal performance to Omkara walled Langa Tyagi after many years
 bahut hi behtareen abhinay karte hue najar aate hai
 Along with this, Rohan Mehra, son of his famous actor Vinod Mehra, is also making a foray into the Hindi film industry with this film
 lekin unhen dekhakar bilkul nahin lagata ki yah unki pehali film he
 He has been seen acting very well
 radhika apte ne ek baar phir se bataa diya he ki unhen behtareen adaakara kyon kaha jaataa he
 Radhika is seen in the role of Priya Rai
 lekin chitrangada singh ke kaam main zyada dam nahin he wo or behatar kaam kar sakati thi
 The rest of the film's characters have also acted spontaneously
