 '' surat kaa utkal nagar railway overbrij
 It got stuck in the trap of politics that even after a month of its preparation, its release remained stuck in the official work
 isamen mjedaar baat yah ki jab aaj iskaa locarpan hua tocongressor bijepi aamane-saamne aa gaye or brij kaa locarpan ek nahin donon chor se hua
 Actually, the bridge was inaugurated for a month
 sarkaar iskaa udghaatan yah kahkar taalati rahi ki unke paas samay nahin he
 Due to this, the Congress gave an ultimatum that if the bridge is not inaugurated, the Congress will release it itself
 congress kii ghoshnaa ke baad sarkaar jaagi or aanan-fanan main brij kaa locarpan karne ke faisla kiya
 The release date was kept as 24 September, but when the government came to know that the Congress was about to launch on 21 September, then the date of the inauguration was suddenly changed from 24 to 21 September
 yahi vajah thi ki aaj brij ke ek ore gujarat sarkaar ke mantri nanu vanani brij ne locarpan kiya to duusare chor par congress kaaryakartao ne brij par gaadiyaan chalaa di or locarpan bataate hue ise aam janata ke liye khol diya
 Congress workers shouted 'jai Sardar Jai Patidar' before driving the vehicle on the bridge
 congressi kaaryakarta brij par vaahan chalaakar pahunche to bijepi or congress ke log aamane-saamne aa gaye
 However, due to the tension during the inauguration of the bridge, the police had launched a large force here
 jis kaaran maamla shantipurna dhang se nipat gaya
 The Congress has named this bridge after the saint Pramukh Swami of the Swaminarayan sect
 haalanki, is baar jis tarah se choti-choti baton ko lekar bijepi ore congress chunaav se pahele aamane-saamne aa rahi he, usase yah dekhnaa kaaphi dilachasp hoga ki chunaav ke vakt yah ladaai voter par kitni haaavee hoti he

 dilli ke chidyaghar main safed baagh ke baade main girakar ek yuvak ne apni jaan ganvaa di
 After the painful death of this young man named Maqsood, questions are being raised on the zoo administration
 sawaal isliye bhi gambhir hai, kyonki makasuud ko bachaane ke liye prashasan ke paas puure 10 minute kaa vakt tha, jise ganvaa diya gaya
 As soon as Maqsood fell into the tiger enclosure, the administration staff did not take any action for 10 minutes
 aise kuch upaay the, jise apanaakar yuvak kii jaan bachaai ja sakati he
 First of all, there should have been a hanging ladder in the zoo
 agar rassi kii madad se banaai gai seedhi ko baagh ke baade main lataka diya jaataa, to yuvak kii jaan batch sakati thi
 The tiger remained very quiet until long after the fall of Maqsood
 aise main yah upaay kargar sabit ho saktaa tha
 Secondly, the tiger could also be rendered unconscious with the Tranquilizer Gun
 isse aasaani se baagh par kaabo paa liya jaataa or makasuud kii jaan batch sakati thi
 The seven-year-old white tiger tortured the 27-year-old Maqsood, who had fallen into its enclosure, for more than 15 minutes, but the truncular gun used within five minutes to save it was about 250 meters away from the zoo
 She was lying in the hospital
 tranculizer gan ko 'capchar gan' yaa 'dirt gan' bhi kehete hai
 Truncular guns have long been used in all zoos and forests of the country to control and capture dangerous animals without getting hurt
 is gan main sui kii tarah goli hoti he, jo chubte hi minuton main sharir main nashila chemical failaa detaa he or jaanavar behosh hokar gir jaataa he
 According to government rule, dangerous animals must have three employees with truncular guns
 in karmchaariyon main ek keeper, ek assistant keeper va ek atendent hone chahie
 They will remain stationed as long as the zoo is open to the public
 lekin rajdhani ke chidyaghar main sirf do hi tranculizer gan hone se uskaa istemaal hi nahin ho rahaa tha
 She lay in the hospital and the staff stood near the enclosure of unarmed dangerous animals
 chidyaghar ke karmchaaree agar furti se kaam lekar baagh ke baade main lage barier ko paar karne main makasuud kii madad karte, to bhi shaayad yuvak ko apni jaan nahin ganvaani padati
 However, the zoo administration did not take any measures and left the young man in his condition, the result of which is in front of everyone

 Delhi Pradesh BJP President Satish Upadhyay told the media today after meeting senior party leader and Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh that the BJP is ready for election
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki party sarkaar banane ke liye bhi taiyaar he
 But, the matter has to be decided by the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi
 gauratlab he ki dilli main raajnneetik sargarmi charam par he, or agar sutron kii maane to sarkaar banane ke liye bijepi kii congress ke chah vidhayakon se andarkhaana baatcheet bhi ho chuki he
 Actually, the conversation had been going on for a month, but now the news of media has started the phase of allegations and counter-allegations and political conspiracies
 ek bijepi vidhayak kaa yah bhi kahana he ki sab kuch lagbhag saaf ho chukaa he, or ab to bas alaakaman se hari jhandi milane kaa intazaar he
 On the other hand, Congress MLA Mohammad Asif also created a stir in the political circles by claiming that the Aam Aadmi Party is also trying to form a government through the horse-trading of mlas and in return for supporting the AAP government in the Cabinet
 Ministerial status was offered

 taarikh thi 11 aktubar
 It was about three o'clock in the afternoon that my phone rang
 ‘ananon number’ (anjaan number) dekhakar main sochane laga ki kiskaa ho saktaa he
 There has been a wide-ranging conversation with Sachin Tendulkar in the morning, he cannot be
 ve bhala kyon phone karenge
 i picked up the phone in the same turmoil
 sachin bina laag-lapet ke bole, “mujhe laga ki aapako bataa duun ki maine west indies shrunkhlaa ke baad ritair hone kaa man bana liya he
 i have conveyed my decision to the BCCI
 ”kuch der tak to mujhe samaj main hi nahin aayaa
 He has been talked about many times during his work on his autobiography for the last two and a half years
 hamane roj bhi subah main is maamle par baat kii thi
 Even then i had no idea about it
 kuch der sann rahane ke baad jaise maine hosh sambhala
 But Sachin's voice was calm and balanced, "don't be emotional
" anjali (unki patni) or ajit (unke bhai) bhavuk ho rahe hai
 Do not treat me like a retired cricketer before retirement
 ” or phir hanskar bole, “mujhe abhi to do test khelnaa he or main thik se khelnaa chahta hum
 Sachin started planning for the West Indies series
 unhen andaja tha ki agle kuch hafton main unke irdagird kya hone vaala he isliye unhone tay kiya tha ki is bhavukta ke jowar or uttejnaa se khud ko alag rakhenge
 Now it was time for Vela to say goodbye
 aadhi raat biit chuki thi or mast blaster sachin jage hue the
 They were trying to strike a balance by declaring the whole of India in their arms; They were trying to accept the reality that they have decided to say goodbye to the game of cricket which has been their life for 30 years
 chalis saal kii umr ke baad ritair jivan kaisaa hoga? ve 19 november ke baad kya karenge? kya bhavishya kii yojanaayen taiyaar kar lee gai hai? ye kathin sawaal hai or abhi inke koi nishchit jawaab nahin hai
 The truth is that they have not even considered it yet
 jo sachin ko jaanate hai, unhen pataa he ki ve abhi ritairement kaa saamana karne ko taiyaar nahin hai
 Right now, they have one obligation to fulfill: to land in India for the last time
 abhi to unke dimag main yahi chaaya hua he
 There are three different possibilities for him after he retires
 ek, jaisaa ki nita ambani ne pushti kii he, sachin 2014 ipiel main mumbai indian ke liye mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaayenge
 Secondly, as a Rajya Sabha member, Sachin has always wished to contribute to the development of sports at the grassroots level
 unhone isi saal maanav sansaadhan vikaas or khel mantralayon ko aage kii yojanaon ke bare main ek adhyayan patr pesh kiya he
 They would like to work on those plans further
 aakhir main, ve ghar par anjali or bacchon—arjuna or sara—ke saath samay bitaana chaahate hai jo unke khel main vyastata ke kaaran adhuraa-sa rah gaya he
 Now that they have decided to hang their kitbag on the peg, what will be the meaning of cricket for them? The answer to this question will help in knowing the secret of life after his retirement
 sidhe-sidhe kahen to cricket hi unki jindagi he
 This is their passion, livelihood, enterprise and occupation
 maine 2012 ke prarambh main australia test shrunkhlaa ke bich main unase unki ritairement yojana ke bare main poocha tha
 i wanted to know from him what his thoughts are about covering the book i am writing on his life
 unhone tapaak se kaha, “abhi ham us par baat na karen to acha
 We will see when we reach that point
 ” yah kehete hue unki ankhon main ubhari ashankaon ko pard paanaa mushkil nahin tha
 It is as if he was born to play cricket and the thought of leaving him one day is scary for him
 ant main shaayad record, prashansaaen, aankade kuch bhi myne nahin rakhte
 All they want is to pick up the bat and run towards their 22-yard temple
 vahi unka ekmaatr aashray he or use hi ab ve chhodie ja rahe hai
 Several days after expressing the thought of saying goodbye to Sachin, i urged him to take some time for the next chapter of the book
 yah darj karnaa jaruri he ki kis baat ne unhen ghoshnaa karne ko prerit kiya
 Sachin showed no interest
 unka dhyaan west indies ke match kii taiyaari main laga tha
 He wanted to perform well in that
 unhone kaha, “yah shrunkhlaa khatm hone ke baad ham kitaab par dhyaan den
 Right now i want to focus on practice for the next few weeks
 ” yah nishkarsh nikaalnaa aasaan tha ki ve sahi frem main aane ke liye haryana ke khilaaf ranjai trophy match khelenge
 But we had no idea of what was to happen to him in Lahli
 unhone pehle din kaa khel khatm hone par likhaa, “pich par kaaphi hariyaali thi
 "he was dismissed for a sudden ball after scoring 5 runs in the first innings
 duusari pari main mumbai 236 ranon kaa peechha karte hue shuruaati wicket ganvaa chuki thi
 Sachin knew what he had to do
 yahi ve 24 saal se karte aae hai
 This time he played the last match for Mumbai with a score of 79 runs
 unhen pataa tha ki sara desh dekh rahaa he
 He also knew that for the first time in history, the craze for Ranji Trophy matches would achieve trps like the saas-bahu serial
 match khatm hone ke baad unhone likhaa, “vaaki acchhee taiyaari hui
 There was a lot for the bowlers in the pitch
 ishwar mahaan he
 "was he talking about preparing for the South Africa series or two matches for Kolkata and Wankhede? Have they, for a moment, forgotten that they are not going to South Africa? If he was not going to get a green grass pitch in Eden Gardens or Wankhede, then who were you talking about? Sachin arrived in Kolkata on the night of 3 November
 yani kisi test match ke liye aam taur par pahunchane vaale samay se ek din pehle
 The Indian team was in practice from 10 am the next morning
 ve 4 taarikh ko hi tadake kii udaan pakad sakate the
 He was not allowed to celebrate Diwali at home but did not approve of leaving his 199th Test practice
 ham 4 november ko taj bengal hotel main mili to baarikiyon par unke dhyaan ko jaan sake
 Sachin was busy with his bat
 balle ke hathe ke neeche logo thodaa udhada hua tha
 i asked him how it happened, "the bat was laminated at the last moment and when you play on a bouncy pitch, as it was in Lahli, it can get an edge
" main yah mauka nahin dena chahta
 “such attention is not limited to sports, exceptions are seen in any field
 unke ek pramukh pratidwandvi alan donald kehete hai, “unki taiyaari hi unhen ponting or lara se alag karti he
 This is the secret of their existence for the last two and a half decades
 ”eden main pehle din do apratyaashit darshak bhi the anjali or arjuna
 Neither of them were expected to come and Sachin was shocked to see them
 anjali do hafte se kah rahi thim ki ve kolkata nahin janaa chaahatin kyonki isse sachin kaa dhyaan bantega
 She could not resist herself on the last occasion
 anjali kahati hai, “misses nita ambani ke janmdin kii party main meri ek ajij dost ne mujhase kaha ki kuch dinon baad tum apane jivan main yah mauka kabhi nahin paa sakogi
 That was a scary feeling and when Sachin started leaving for Kolkata, he said that last time i am calling you goodbye for going out of the city in a Test match
 ve airport ke liye nikle to main apane aansu nahin roak pai
 Then i made an intention to go to Kolkata
 ”sachin arjuna ke saath anjali ko dekhakar khush ho gaye
 After the first day's play he was able to spend an hour with him in his room
 unhone arjuna ko ek gend di jise vah mumbai le gaya
 Anjali laughingly says, "we stayed together for an hour but even during that time, Sachin did not take the bat away from him
 ” ve agle din apni pari kii taiyaari main lage the
 However, good preparation does not always lead to good results
 gend sachin ke ghutane ke upar pad par lagi or ampire nigel long kii ungali uth gai jabaki gend saaf-saaf stump ke upar ja rahi thi
 Sachin knows that now the chance is over
 rohit sharma ke pehle hi test main shatak kii badaulat bharat ranon kaa ambara laga rahaa tha or shami ahamed kii acchhee gendbaaji se west indies dher ho gai thi
 Sachin now had just two chances to bat at Wankhede
 ve yah sochakar kuch hairaan bhi the ki unke maamle main behtareen ampire simon toffel, aleem daar, rod takkanar or nigel long kyon kai baar sadhran chook kar baithte hai
 Does his image add extra pressure to the umpires? Sachin left these questions for debate and left for Mumbai for his last test
 anjali apane pati kii shandaar safalataa dekhnaa chaahati thim lekin ve dil masos kar rah gayi
 However, Kolkata partially compensated for this disappointment
 shandaar vidaai kii chhap unke man par hameshaa bani rahegi
 The audience of Eden Gardens were stunned as Saurabh Ganguly embraced his cricketing best friend Sachin
 sachin to behad bhavuk the hi
 He was also happy that 199 kg rose petals were not put on him, as was the plan earlier
 unke ek kareebi dost vivek paalkar ne tahaakaa lagaate hue kaha, “vah to dab hi jaataa
 On this, another childhood friend of his who reached Kolkata quipped, "at least it smells good
 ” ve unka match dekhne gaye the
 When Wankhede's Vela arrived, Sachin again started preparing
 ve usee cheez kii taiyaari karne lage jiske liye unhen janaa jaataa he—parfections kii taiyaari
 This opportunity is also special for him that for the first time his mother Rajni will join the audience
 kolkata test khatm hone ke fouran baad sachin ne kanpur main apane doston ko apni biimaar maa ke liye ek jodi vishesh juuton kii yaad dilaai, taaki unhen vankhede main chalane main aasaani ho
 a ramp in the stadium is under his supervision
 aakhri test kii purv sandhya par sachin ke kareebi doston ne unke sammaan main ek party kaa aayojan kiya
 It is organized by childhood friend Sunil Hershey
 ve ise mahaan khilaadi ko ‘sachin gang’ kii ore se nijee uphaar kehete hai
 In India Today's November 12 Salam Sachin Conclave, Anjali said, "we want to live every moment
" har bhaavana hamaare liye vishesh he
 Sachin and i will always remember these days
 ” ve in dinon ko yaad rakhenge lekin ek raashtra ke rup main ham sabhi 24 varshon ko kabhi nahin bhul paaenge

 On Friday, the Congress has given a strong sarcasm to Prime Minister Narendra Modi amid reports of Chinese army re-submission in Doklam
 party ne piem modi se poocha ki kya doklam samjhauta 'tut' gaya he? congress pravaktaa randeep surajevaala ne'da print' ke 'doklam pathaar ke paas jamaa hue chini sainik, satellite photo main dikhe'news report ko twitor par share karte hue likhaa, "pradhanmantri ne yathasthiti kaa daawa kiya tha

 The Ministry said that for the last two days, these reports have been going on continuously on social media that the Chinese soldiers are resettling at the place where the army of India and China were face to face in Kidoklam
 soshal media par isse judi kuch tasviren bhi viral ho rahi hai, jisamen yah dikhaaya ja rahaa tha ki kis tarah se doklam main china kii sena phir se gaadi, hathiyaar or sazosaman juta rahi he
 Rumors of Chinese army depositing on Doklam On Thursday, a spokesman of the Ministry of External Affairs called these ongoing reports on social media as rumor and mischief
 saath hi yah kaha ki china kii sena ab jo kuch kar rahi he, vah sab kuch china kii seemaa ke bheetar kar rahi he, jahaan koi vivaad nahin he
 Foreign Ministry spokesman Ravish Kumar said that reports of Chinese troops re-mobilizing the disputed area of doklam are not correct and after the matter was resolved on August 28, nothing new has happened at that place

 The Supreme Court has given an important verdict, saying that Christian personal law, Indian Christian Marriage Act 1872 and Divorce Act 1869 cannot be effective by repealing
 yani saaf he ki personal lau ke tahat carch se die gaye talaak vaid nahin honge
 The Supreme Court accepted the Centre's plea that cited the 1996 Supreme Court order that personal laws of any religion cannot dominate the statutory laws of the country
 yani canan lau ke tahat talaak kanoonee rup se maanya nahin hoga
 The Supreme Court rejected a public interest litigation seeking legal recognition for divorce from the church
 yachika main kaha gaya tha ki carch se mili talaak par civil court kii muhar laganaa jaruri na ho
 In fact, this PIL by Clarence Pius, a resident of Mangalore, was accepted for consideration by the Supreme Court in 2013 itself
 khaas baat yah he ki isaayiyon ke dharm vidhaan ke mutabik catholic isaayiyon kii carch main dharmik adaalat main padri dwaara talaak va anya dikriyaan di jaati hai
 On behalf of the petitioner in the Supreme Court it was said that after the divorce decree given by the Church, when some people got second married, they got sued for polygamy
 aise main supreme court yah ghoshit kare ki canan lau (dharm vidhaan) main carch dwaara di ja rahi talaak kii decri maanya decri hogi or is par civil adaalat se talaak kii muhar jaruri nahin he
 However, the government has opposed the petition
 sarkaar kii ore se daakhil jawaab main kaha gaya he ki maang sweekaar nahin kii ja sakati kyonki talaak adhinium lagu he or court use vaidhanik bhi tehra chukaa he
 This is not the only issue related to the divorce of Christians which is pending in the Supreme Court
 isai dharm ko maanane vaale ek anya vyakti ne bhi supreme court main yachika daakhil kar rakhi he jisamen talaak adhinium kii dhara-10 (e) kii upadhara (1) ko chunauti di gai he
 According to this, the Christian religious is conditioned to remain in isolation for two years for divorce, while in other laws Special Marriage Act and Hindu Marriage Act, this period is one year

 The last match of the five-match Test series that started in Chennai between India and England is very special
 is match ke dauraan or parinaam ke saath hi team or teen bhootpurv cricketron kapil dev, sunil gavaskar or mahendra singh dhoni ke record bhi daanv par lage hai
 India have already won the Test series but winning 4-0 means firstly taking revenge on England as Mahendra Singh Dhoni's revenge for the 0-4 defeat against Australia (in 2011-12)
 Had won the series 4–0 (in 2013–14) but now it was revenge for losing three consecutive series with a 0–4 defeat against England in 2011
 3-0 se aage hai hi ab 4-0 kaa bada mauka he
 So let us tell you one by one what changes are likely to happen in the record book of Indian cricket from this match
 tuutegaa lagaataar aparajit rahane kaa bhartiya recordteam india pichley 17 test maichon se lagaataar aparaajey he
 Virat's army equaled this record for the first time under the leadership of Kapil Dev between 1985 and 1987, with the victory in the last Test
 tab 14 sitambar 1985 se nau march 1987 tak yah silsilaa chalaa tha or jab pakistan ke haathon bangaleru test main mili 16 ranon kii haar ke saath aparaajey rahane kaa yah kram tutaa tab kapil ne apni captaini ganvaa di
 In that unbeatable campaign, the Kapil Dev-led Indian team recorded four wins while the remaining matches were drawn
 viraat ne na keval isaki barabari kii balki wo record ko kahin aage le gaye kyonki unke aankade 13 jeet or keval paanch drow bataate hai
 Now, by winning the Chennai Test, he will not only have a chance to make a new Indian record but also take another step towards its world record
 chennai test main jeet yaa mahaj drow se hi 29 saal purana bhartiya record tut jayega
 Dhoni's record will be matched by Kohli, who managed to win in Chennai, India will win for the first time in a 4–0 Test series against England
 4-0 se test siries jeetna kitni badi uplabdhi he iskaa andaja isi se lagaaya ja saktaa he 1932 main pehali test siries khilne ke baad se ab tak 84 saal ke bhartiya cricket itihaas main yah keval doosraa mauka hoga jab bharat 4-0 se test siries jitegaa
 Earlier India did this only in 2013
 tab australia se chaar test maichon kii siries clin sweep kiya tha
 This huge achievement was bestowed on the head of India's most successful Test captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni
 yani test main sabase badi siries jeet ke maamle main bharat ke sabase safal test captain dhoni kii barabari kar lenge viraat
 Virat has two rare records to his name
 Team India captain Virat Kohli has scored 640 runs at an average of 80 in this series so far
 chennai main agar unke balle se 93 ran nikle to sunil gavaskar ke record ko todate hue viraat ek siries main sarvaadhik ran banane vaale bhartiya captain ho jaaenge
 Gavaskar scored 732 runs as a captain against the West Indies in 1978–79
 itnaa hi nahin viraat ke paas 45 saal purana ek test record todane kaa bhi mauka he
 However, for this, he will have to score 135 runs in Chennai
 aisa karte hi wo kisi test siries main kisi bhi bhartiya cricketer ke sarvaadhik ranon ke record ko dhwast kar denge
 This record is also in the name of Sunil Gavaskar
 unhone apane pehle westeindies daure par chaar test pariyon main 774 ran jade the jo aaj tak nahin tutaa
 Ashwin to break world record Ravichandran Ashwin needs just three wickets to make this world record
 chennai main teen wicket lete hi pichley 35 saal se chale aa rahe sabase tej 250 test wicket lene kaa world record tod denge aswin
 For this, where Lily played 48 matches, this is Ashwin's 44th Test
 itnaa hi nahin, agle do wicket ke saath hi aswin test maichon main ek calendar saal main sarvaadhik wicket lene kaa bhartiya record bhi tod denge
 For a long time, this loud sound in the ears is creating a special echo
 yah desh kii sarvaadhik moolyawaan, baari-bharkam buland aawaaj he, akeli or anokhi
 When he speaks a dialogue of his new thriller 'badla', the strong voice resonates in the atmosphere - 'I see the 6 that you are showing or the 9 i want to see'
 is aawaaj kii apni ek khaasiyat he
 There is no need for any other technique to decorate it
 amitabh bachchan (amitabh bachchan) or unke shilp ne kai pidiyon par raaj kiya he

 Adjectives, hyperbole and rhetoric came their way, but they did not let it dominate them
 abhi bhi log unke mureed hai
 His inner revolution (he was given the name by his father Harivansh Rai Bachchan at the time of his birth, but later changed to Amitabh) is still not quiet, and his quest as an actor is still on
 amitabh bachchan (amitabh bachchan) se hui baatcheet ke khaas ansh is prakaar hai :-aap 50 saal kii apni is yatra ko kis rup main dekhte hai

 internet par is tasviir ke failana shuru hone ke saath hi india today kii fact chack team ne isaki sachai jaanane ke liye padtaal kii
 The title was given with the picture- 'kabhi Aao To Amethi'
 thode hi vakt main tasviir ko soshal media ke vibhinn plateforms par 5,000 se zyada baar share kiya ja chukaa tha
 Was this picture actually of Amethi? So the answer is no
 is tasviir ko uttarakhand news network naam ke news portal ke 16 july 2015 ko prakashit artical se uthaaya gaya
 The portal's article claimed that it was a picture of Dharchula town in Uttarakhand where a unique protest was held over the poor condition of the road
 portal ke mutabik gali-sadakon par keechad kii bharmaar or jagah-jagahpani bharaa honese pareshaan ek shaks ne dharchula ke balavakot kii sadak par dhan ke paudhe bona shuru kar diya
 India Today's Fact Check team contacted local authorities in Uttarakhand to investigate the portal's claim
 iske baad saaf hua ki ye tasviir dharchula kii bhi nahin he jaisaa ki portal ne daawa kiya tha
 In reality, this picture is of the chowkhutia-masi road in Almora district
 vahiin ke ek sthaneey naagarik pappu satti, jo khud is anokhe virodh pradarshan kaa hissaa rahe, ne india today ko bataaya, hamane dhan ke paudhe virodh jataane ke liye sadak par lagaae the kyonki mere kshetra main sahi myne main sadaken maujuud hi nahin hai
 The road that this picture is in was completely washed away in water
 adhikariyon kaa dhyaan khinchne ke liye dhan ke paudhe lagaae gaye
 In 2015, the Congress was in Uttarakhand and Harish Rawat was the Chief Minister of the state
 us virodh pradarshan ke baad kshetra main sadak nirmaan shuru hua
 After the completion of road construction, Rawat himself came to the area
 graminon ne uswakt nirmaanadhin sadak kii tasviren bhi hamaare saath share kii
 The viral test showed that the picture is correct but the place it claimed to be with was wrong
 tasviir uttar pradesh ke amethi kii nahin balki uttarakhand ke almoda kii he

 sansad main shaam saadhe chaar baje is mudde par athiks cameti kii baithak hogi
 Earlier, BJP MP Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi questioned Ghulam Nabi Azad's statement in the Rajya Sabha, in which he compared the RSS to the terrorist organization IS
 aaazaad ne kaha, 'agar mere bayaan main kuch bhi galat mili to mujhe sansad se nikaal den
 If there is anything wrong in my statement, bring a privilege motion in Parliament
 There was a lot of uproar in the House on this issue
 aaazaad ne hangaamaa hone ke baad rajyasabha main apana bayaan bhi padhakar sunaaya
 Naqvi said that there is restlessness in the country from Ghulam Nabi Azad
 is bayaan ke liye unhone aaazaad se maafee maangane kii maang kii
 The Congress leader said, "if anything is found wrong in my statement, then expel me from Parliament
" jarur padhein: 'aaazaad bol' se bijepi baichaiyngulaam nabi ajaadane rajyasabha main apane bayaan kii sidi dikhaai or kaha ki bijepi ke saansad apane kamare main jaakar isi sidi ko sune
 When there was an uproar, Azad asked the BJP mps to dare to listen to the answer
 aaazaad ne kaha ki unke bayaan main kuch galat ho to sansad main visheshadhikaar prastaav laaen
 What Ghulam Nabi Azad said: The Leader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha said in the 'national Integration Conference' organized by the Muslim organization Jamiat ulema-e-hind, "we see such people even among Muslims who have destroyed the Muslim countries
" Have become the reason
 inke peeche kuch takate hai
 But we need to understand why Muslims are joining it, why are they getting trapped? ”he added,“ So we oppose organizations like ISIS in the same way as they oppose the RSS
 agar islam main aise log hon jo galat chijen karte hai, to ve aresas se kam nahin hai

 tex se chidhane waalon ke bich yah kahawat mashhoor he ki aap tex chukaate nahin, ve tex vasuulate hai
 Who also likes tax? But tax is the aspect that makes the exercise of the budget name interesting for a large population
 iske alaava bajet main jo bhi hota he, usase bharat ke aadha fisadi logon kii jindagi prabhavit nahin hoti
 The first real budget of the Modi government (july budget was only eight months) may be waiting for big schemes and reforms, but the foundation of the budget, economic conditions and future preparations show that the real meaning of the budget is its tax
 May be hidden in proposals
 tex se hamaara matlab inakam tex se haragij nahin he jo keval mutthi bhar logon kii chintaa he
 We are talking about the largest tax family which incurs consumption and production (excise, customs and service tax) and affects everyone
 tex bure hai lekin tex badhaakar use sudhaar or sangrakshan kii packaging main pesh karne kaa avasar kabhi-kabhi hi aata he, vitt mantri arun jetali shaayad yah mauka chuknaa nahin chahenge
 When Prime Minister Narendra Modi played the bugle of Make in India, he did not know how non-competitive production in India is due to cheap imports
 mek in india par do teen baithkon ke baad hi sarkaar ko ilham ho gaya ki aayaat mahangaa kiye bina menuphaccharing ko pratispardhaatmak bananaa asambhav he, kyonki byaaj daren, jameen or bijli sasti karnaa yaa shram kanoonon main badlaav dur kii kaudi hai
 If this budget wants to give the land of reality to Make in India, then there can be a substantial increase in custom duty on all products
 kai aayaat aise hai jin par custom duty kii dar dablutio main nirdhaarit daron se kam he, isliye vitt mantri ke paas vikalp maujuud hai
 They will also please the indigenous paracars by increasing the custom duty, however the strong lobby of importers will try to stop them
 bharat kaa sabase bada kar sudhaar bhi ab tex kii dar badaye bina paravaan nahin chadhega
 Preparations for GST have started
 centre va rajya kar dhaanchon ko milakar bharat main jiesti kii dar 25 se 30 fisad tak ho sakati he
 If GST is to be implemented next year, the central excise duty and service tax rates will have to be increased by one or two per cent (12 to 13 or 14) to pave the way for an integrated tax system (GST)
 vitt mantri lage haath, lagjri utpaadon par tex badhaane ke maukey kaa istemaal bhi karnaa chahenge
 Inflation is under control, demand is low anyway, so if some things are expensive due to increase in duty, then the logic of increasing investment and employment in domestic industries and bringing GST will help the Finance Minister
 bajet kii doorgaami aarthik sujh bhi tex se nikalne kii sambhaavna he
 Reduction of tax collection in proportion to GDP in India is an important aspect
 kamjor tex jidipi reshio bataata he ki arthvyavastha bad rahi he lekin tex sangrah nahin
 In India, this ratio has been swinging between 8 and 12 per cent for two decades, which is even lower than the BRICS countries like Brazil, Russia, South Africa
 vitt mantri kar dhaanche main badlaav ke jariye is anupaat main ijaphe kii koshish karte najar aaenge jo global agenciyon kii apekshaaon ke mafik he
 The formula for calculating gross domestic production (farming, industry, service) in India has also changed
 puraani gananaa buniyadi laagat (basic cost) par hoti thi yani jo keemat nirmaataa yaa utpaadak ko milti he
 But now the basic cost will be included in the indirect cost along with calculating the cost of production, so by increasing the tax the GDP can also be brightened
 bharat ke bajet hameshaa kharch se bharpoor hote rahe hai
 The government also wants the budget to be seen through the window of income tax concessions meant for a small salaried or enterprising population or the people should be lured into spending figures in the budget
 saste kachche tel or sabsidi main kami ke kaaran sarkaar ke paas acchhee bachat he jo kharch ke liye jagah bana rahi he
 This expenditure will have some impact on infrastructure, but if political concerns are raised head on, the central scheme raj and subsidy will increase
 vaise kharch ko bajet ke saath nahin balki saal ke ant me dekhnaa behatar hota he kyonki bajet bhaashan ke dauraan badi-badi sankhyaon par taaliyaan bajati hai or chah maah bitne ke baad kharch katkar vitt mantri bachatabahadur ho jate hai
 India's tax policy is at a critical juncture
 custom duty main katautee, sarvice tex or rajyon main waite, tex sudhaaron ke pehlecharan kaa hissaa the jinka makasad bhartiya bazaar ko duniya ke liye udaar karnaa or karadaataaon kii sankhya badhanaa tha
 The next phase of tax reforms is focused on limiting the number of taxes, reducing costs and preventing evasion to make industries and trade competitive
 jiesti kaa yahi makasad he
 The expenditure figures in the budget are political, which evaporates as soon as the budget is presented
 jetali ke kharch aankade bhi tikaoo nahin honge
 Their eyes will be on the tax proposals
 tex shaashvat satya hai jo puure saal maujuudagi kaa ehsaas karaate hai
 The tax policy of modi-jaitley will determine the future of investment in India

 agsit pole ke nateezon ko congress samet duusare kai dal khaarij kar chuke hai
 Congress spokesperson Rajiv Shukla, while holding a press conference on behalf of the party, said that exit polls are for entertainment and the result was a joke
 darasal, congress sutron kaa maananaa he ki uske survey ke mutabik akele congress kareeb 140 ke aas-paas siten jeet rahi he
 At the same time, NDA will be reduced to 180
 haalanki agsit pole ke nattejey aane ke baad bhi congress endie ko adhiktam 200 se zyaada siten dene ko taiyaar nahin he
 The Congress believes that it is not as much as the exit polls are telling the BJP in states like Orissa and Bengal, and in states where BJP was at the top in 2014, there is bound to be a deficit
 congress hi nahin samaajawaadee party or bahujan samaaj party bhi agsit pole nattejey ko khaarij kar chuke hai
 SP General Secretary Ram Gopal Yadav told Aaj Tak that exit polls will be razed on 23rd
 vahiin basapa mahasachiv satish chandra mishra ne kaha ki agsit pole kaise hote hai sab jaanate hai
 By the way, TDP leader Chandrababu Naidu is meeting the most with his survey, in which the Congress is estimated to have 129 seats and the NDA with a maximum of 179 seats
 darasal, agsit pole ke nateezon par andarkhaane vipaksh netaa 3 badi baaten bataa rahe hai
 1
 yaa to modi sarkaar iviem main badi gadabadi kar chuki he yaa karne vaali he, isliye agsit pole ke jariye maahaul taiyaar kiya ja rahaa he
 2

 Significantly, on Tuesday, 22 opposition parties approached the Election Commission on the issue of disturbances in evms and vvpats
 unhone har vidhansabha kshetra main 50 pratishat vivipat parchiyon kii iviem se milan kii maang doharaai, jise supreme court bhi khaarij kar chukaa he
 These parties said that if the VVPAT slips at a polling station are not correctly matched, then the VVPAT slips of all the polling stations in that assembly constituency should be counted and then match the results of the evms
 congress netaa gulam nabi aaazaad ne nirvachan ayog se baithak ke baad iviem main gadabadi hone kaa andeshaa jataayaa
 However, the Election Commission rejected all claims of the opposition parties, saying that evms and vvpats are completely safe in the strong room
 jin mashiinon kii shikaayat saamne ai, unka voting ke dauraan istemaal kiya hi nahin gaya
 The Election Commission said that evms and VVPAT machines are sealed after voting and they are kept under surveillance of CCTV cameras in the Strong Room
 ummidavaar or unke pratinidhi strong room ko kabhi bhi dekh sakate hai

 inputah IANS The negligible participation of Muslim youth in terrorist networks, the web-based channel on which the voice of religious leaders is heard, the study of the movements of extremist elements in the country
 All the things needed to fight propaganda on social media are part of the blue print that the Modi government has given to bigotry and communal hatred
 Made under the strategic plan to fight

 '' taarikh thi 28 may 2004
 That day, journalist Sanjay Baru was celebrating his 50th birthday in Hyderabad
 achaanak unkephone kii ghanti bajati he
 Voice on picking up the phone - Is it Mr
 Sanjay Baru? Mr
 TKA Nair, Principal Secretary to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, wants to talk
 phir nair line par aate hai or kehete hai- mistar baru, vaise to ham kabhi nahin mili hai
 But, i am the Principal Secretary of PM
 pradhanmantri aapse milanaa chaahate hai
 Can you come this evening Sanjay Baru tells him that he is in Hyderabad, not Delhi and can only come on weekends
 is par unhone kaha ki vah kuch samay main dobaaraa phone kar somvaar ko pradhanmantrise mulaakaat kaa samay tay karte hai
 The same evening, Sanjay Baru's phone rings again during the birthday family party
 is baar ritred naukarshah enen vohara kii aawaaj phone par goonjati he
 Vohra was the Secretary of the Ministry of Home and Defense and also the Principal Secretary of PM Inder Kumar Gujral
 vohara ne bataaya ki sanjay ,aap somvaar ko piem se mil rahe ho or ve aapako offis jwine karne ke liye kahenge
 He had asked me too, so i too have told you a good person
 apni kitaab'da accidental prime ministar (the Accidental Prime Minister)' main sanjay baru likhte hai ki main manmohan singh ke piemo main kaary ke liye taiyaar tha
 During that time Sanjay Baru did not tell this good news to anyone other than his father
 is tarah sanjay baru kojanmdin par piemo se kaam kaa gift mila
 Sanjay Baru was appointed media advisor to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in May 2004
 vah is pad par agast 2008 tak rahe
 Based on Sanjay Baru's book written about Manmohan Singh, The Accidental Prime Minister is going to release on January 11
 isevijay ratnakar guttey ne diarect kiya he
 Sanjay Baru says that i never planned to write a book while i was Manmohan Singh's media advisor
 is naate maine koi diary bhi nahin rakhi thi
 Although during his tenure, he made notes of some major events
 bakaul baru," 2012 ke ant tak maine tay kiya ki mai koi kitaab nahin likhuunga
 But Chick Sarkar and Kamini Mahadevan of Penguin Books India changed my mind
 " sanjay baru likhte hai kimera maananaa tha ki yah swaabhaavik he ki ek netaa yaa to prashansa kaa paatr ho yaa phirghruna kaa, magar uphaas kaa paatranhin bananaa chahie
 Sanjay Baru wrote that when i left the PMO in 2008, the media used to call him Singh is King
 chaar saal baad ek news megsine ne singh ij sin'king' kaha
 This was evidence of a rapidly falling image
 sanjay baru likhte hai- unhone(manmohan) kai galtiyaan kii, is kitaab main uskaa ullekh karne main jhijak nahin he
 The first term was fine, but the second term was full of financial scandals and bad news
 unhone raajnneeti par se niyantran bhi kho diya
 The office (PMO) became ineffective
 sanjay baru ne likhaa he ki unase patrakaron, rajanyikon, udhyamiyon, netaaon or mitron ne kai sawaal kiye
 For example, was UPA One more successful than UPA 2? Why pm's image is tarnished ?piem manmohan or congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ke kaise rishte hai
 The Why did you leave the PMO
 sanjay baru ne likhaa he ki unhone piemo kuch nijee kaarnon se choda
 However, except for this last question in the book, all the other questions have been answered
 sanjay baru ke mutabik isamen koi andeh nahin ki 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav main jeet ke manmohan singh architect the
 But he did not get his credit

 isi ko dekhte hue deepika ke paas kaam karne kaa ek acha ofer hai
 Katrina Kaif and Ranbir Kapoor were in the news about their breakup with Ranbir during the film 'jagga Jasoos'

 The person named Liaquat Ali was caught by the Delhi Police, made a terrorist and the story was that Delhi was going to be shaken
 kahani ko sach sabit karne ke liye khud hi hathiyaar or hathgole bhi rakhwa die or pole khuli to sach kaa saath dene kii bajaay dilli police kamishnar bhi apane unheen sipahsalaaron kii peeth thonk rahe hai
 Amazing commissioner! i wish he could have read his handiwork in the NIA charge sheet filed in the case of Liaqat at least once before hitting his back and admiring him
 haalanki is baat main bhi koi shaq nahin ki dilli vaale agar chaiyn kii neend sote hai to dilli police kii badaulat
 Many attacks in Delhi were averted, due to the promptness of the Delhi Police, Delhi survived several times if Delhi Police due to hard work
 lagata kamishnar sahab bolte hue bhul gaye ki enie ne ungali puri dilli police par nahin uthaai he
 Rather, he has just described the guiltiness of the 9 policemen who turned an innocent into a terrorist just to enhance his fame and pride
 unhone dilliwaalon ko aatankwaadi hamale ke naam par daraane ke liye apane hi mubir ko aatankwaadi kaa saathi bataa kar usee se guest house main hathiyaar rakhwa die
 And the Commissioner is saying about these officers that their names will be written in golden letters
 kamaal he kamishnar sahab
 The special cell of Delhi Police was born to keep Delhi free from terrorism
 special cell ke afasaron ne jaan jokhim main daal kar bade-bade kaamyaab oparation bhi kiye hai
 Even the martyrdom of Inspector Mohan Chand Sharma of this special cell has not forgotten Delhi, but you also know the commissioner, how many officers of this special cell have been stained
 phir bhi aap kah rahe hai ki inhone kabhi kisi nirdosh ko nahin fansaaya
 Commissioner, it is the duty of a captain to manage his team
 mushkil halaat main unka saath dena, mushkil halaat main galat baat main nahin
 The NIA has combed through the entire horoscope of that person named Sabir Khan Pathan and found out that he is the face of those brave officers
 or aapke pulisavaale pataa rahe the ki wo aatankwaadi liyakat shah kaa saathi he
 Now the question is that he is the informer of the police, then who went to that guest house to keep a weapon? Who gave it AK 56 rifle and grenade? Why has it been lying in your special cell's Lodhi Colony office for almost ten years? How is its SIM card registered at the special cell office address? Wasn't all this done to implicate Liaquat Ali Shah? According to the news leaked this time by the Special Cell, which specializes in leaking news in its own style, according to your first weapon is the letter from the DG of Jammu and Kashmir in which he The surrender application filed by Liaquat's wife was reportedly dismissed in 2012
 kyonki wo giraftaar se pehle bhi ek sakriy aatankwaadi tha
 But the question arises that if this was the case then why has not a single report been filed against him in India for the whole year? If he was involved in the violence, then who stopped all agencies from writing a report against Liaquat? The question is also that if your argument is correct, then why was the Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir Omar Abdullah and the police there mistaking your arrest wrong? You had Liaqat's wife Amina's phone on surveillance Till time, he kept hearing how she was giving information to the terrorists
 phir sawaal ye uthta he ki aapaki police ne ameena ko giraftaar karne kii bajaay uske shuhar ko kyon pakad liya? cell ke nikali khabaron ke mutabik khud liyakat bhi 17 numberon par hijbul ke aatankwaadiyon se baat kar rahaa tha
 But does SAIL have any such intercept to prove that these conversations were being held to attack Holi? And if there was an intercept, then why did SAIL need to bring its informer Sabir Khan Pathan to the scene for false evidence? a plea is also being given by your police to be your expert
 kah rahi he ki agar wo kuch galat kar rahe hote to bhala apane phone kaa kyon istemaal karte? to janaab aapako yaad dilaa den ki aise namaaloom kitne kisse saamne aa chuke hai jab gunaah main shaamil logon ko unka over kanfidence hi le duba he
 Let us also assume, for once, that all these arguments you said are true, then the question arises that why did your informer Sabir Khan Pathan go to plant arms in Haji Arafat Guest House? The Pathan who was staying in the special cell office? The question is also from where did the weapons and ammunition of bore bore from AK 56 come from him? Do not know what the nia's compulsion is that he does not agree to speak openly against those officers of Special Cell, knowing everything , Who disseminated laws of law, termed an innocent as a terrorist and took him behind bars
 liyakat ali shah ke maamle main enie kii chargeshit beshak police afasaron kii karatuuton kaa pardaafash karti ho, lekin in afasaron ke khilaaf mukadmaa darj karne ke maamle main enie ne chuppi saadh lee he
 If the NIA investigation is correct, if the Delhi Police falsely implicated Liaquat Ali Shah in a terrorism case
 agar dilli police ne aisa karne ke liye farji tareeke se hathiyaar plant karwaae hai, to phir enie kii najar main dilli police ke ve afasar gunahagaar kyon nahin hai?liyakat ali shah ke maamle main enie kii chargeshit saamne aane ke saath yahi wo sabase bada sawaal he jo har kisi ke jehan main kaundh rahaa he
 Because the NIA has opened the Delhi Police Special Cell poll in its charge sheet, but despite everything, it has neither declared these officers guilty nor demanded the court to file criminal cases against them
 balki wo chaahati he ki is maamle main aarushi murder cese kii tarah hi court khud hi chargeshit ke aadhaar par doshi pulisavaalon ke khilaaf mukadmaa darj kar jaruri karrwai kare
 In this case the question is the same, why? Why AIA is refraining from advocating for direct action? The nia's investigation itself suggests that SAIL not only fabricated a false story to implicate Liaquat, but through one of its informers, a weapon like AK 56 in a guest house in Old Delhi And also got the ammunition plant done
 agar ye kahani sahi he to in tamaam afasaron ke khilaaf rongaphul canphinemant, difemeshan, rongphul arest, dames or marpet jaise gunahon ke tahat mukadmaa darj kiya janaa chahie
 Which carries a minimum sentence of 7 years
 thik isi tarah eke 56 or gola-barood plant karne ke gunaah main cell ke mubir sabir pathan ke saath-saath afasaron ke khilaaf bhi arms act ke tahat mukadmaa banataa he
 Which carries a minimum sentence of three years
 lekin enie ne aisi koi maang nahin kii he
 The question is the same, why? After all, despite getting the NIA SAIL officers to break the law, instead of taking legal action against them, the Home Ministry is only seeking departmental action
 enie kii tafteesh kii badaulat salaakhon se nikal kar khuli hawa main saans lene vaale liyakat ali shah or uske gharavaalon ne ab raahat kii saans lee he
 The reason is that in the NIA charge sheet, not only Shah has been described as innocent but he has also demanded to be removed from the case
 lekin special cell kii sajeesh kii badaulat bahut kuch ganvaane vaale liyakat or uske ghar vaale ab dilli police ke khilaaf karrwai chaahate hai
 Liaquat had already got bail after the cell was arrested in the air-air case
 lekin is maamle main enie kii chargeshit shah or uske puure parivaar ke liye khushiyon kaa paigaam lekar ai
 Because in this charge sheet, NIA not only declared Shah as innocent, but also requested the court to finish the case against him
 ab shah ke gharavaale jahaan use clin chit milane kii vajah se khush hai, vahiin wo dilli police ke un afasaron ke khilaaf bhi karrwai kii maang kar rahe hai, jinhone shah ko galat tareeke se giraftaar kiya tha
 After escaping from the clutches of the law, Shah's family is happy, but the mischief is no less
 unka kahana he ki ve pehle hi behad garib the

 The People's Representation Act was to be amended through this ordinance so that leaders are not prevented from contesting elections even after they are convicted in court
 yah kol pradhanmantri kii america raashtrapati baraak obama se mulaakaat ke kuch ghanton pehle hi ai thi
 a momentous moment in the Prime Minister's five-day US visit — Obama and then the first meeting of Pakistan's newly elected Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif — was about to come when suddenly flashes and TV cameras went elsewhere

 The Prime Minister did not react strongly to the news, but his close aides were disappointed with Rahul Gandhi's statement
 congress upaadhyaksh kii sakht pratikriya ne kai sawaal khadey kiye hai: kya loktantr kaa yahi takaza he? kya aise samay main yah karnaa sahi tha, jab pradhanmantri desh se baahar hon? kya congress upaadhyaksh ke paas kendriya mantrimandal ke nirnay par vito lagane kaa adhikaar he?congress upaadhyaksh ke paas kendriya mantrimandal ke nirnay par vito lagane kaa adhikaar he? isi tarah kya pradhanmantri ne rahul gandhi ke aadesh ke saamne aatmasamarpan kar or cabinet ke nirnay ko palatakar centre sarkaar ke nirnay main sanvaidhanik prakriya kaa paalan kiya he or cabinet kii sarvocchata ko barkaraar rakhaa he?doshi netaaon ko chunaav ladgaye se rokane ke sawaal par tathakthith lokapriy mood kaa paksh lekar rahul ne naitik rup se thodi badhat bana lee hogi lekin unhone ek hi jatke main pradhanmantri kii vishwasaneeyata or unki haisiyat ko kaaphi nuksaan pahunchaa diya
 This reinforced the allegations that the Prime Minister is merely a puppet and Rahul and his mother, Congress President Sonia Gandhi, dance behind the scenes

 2002 ke dangon ke mudde par gujarat ke mukhyamantri ko ek bhadde sampradayik vibhaajan kaa janak qaraar dene ke liye vikhyath tista sitalwar ab khud ko apane hi jaal main fansaa paa rahi hai
 Raees Khan, who was a colleague of his and coordinator of his human rights organization Citizens for Justice and Peace (CJP), has accused him of teaching strips to Muslim witnesses of the 2002 riots for his own selfishness
 apane abhiyaan se america or britain jane kaa modi kaa vija radd karwaane ke liye jimmedaar sitalwar se jude is sangharsh ne us samay tikhaa mode le liya, jab ahmedabad ke rahane vaale khan ne aise dastaveji saboot pesh karke sitalwar kaa pardaafash kar dene kii kasam khai ki gujarat dangon ke aath bade maamalon main kis tarah prayek pramukh muslim gavaah ko mahatvapurn logon ko fansaane kii khatir juthi gavaahi dene or balaatkaar jaise sangeen aarope lagane ke liye 5,000 ru
 Every month is being paid
 khan kehete hai, ''in maamalon ke kai muslim gavaahon ko sitalwar hawala ke jariye masik bhugtan karwaati hai
 i too was misled because all this work was being justified in the name of providing justice to the oppressed Muslims
 agar unke paise ke strot sahit is maamle kii vistrut or nishpaksh jaanch ho, to meri baat sahi sabit ho jaaegi
 "nanumian Malik, a supporter of Setalvad and a witness in a riot case, replies," Khan is the agent of the same people we are fighting
 uske aarope puri tarah niraadhaar hai
 Setalvad tried to implicate Khan in court by accusing Malik of having Muslim witnesses sign the pre-fabricated affidavits of all the false accusations made by Hindu attackers, including the rape of Muslim women, and thus their Khan did not give false testimony in court by name, not by Setalvad
 lekin 2008 main sitalwar se naata tod chuke khan ne javaabi aarope lagaaya ki sitalwar unhen mumbai se i-mail se pehle se taiyaar shapath patr bhejtin or kahati thim ki inhen adaalat main pesh karne ke pehle in par muslim gavaahon ke dastakhat karvaa len
 Setalvad's role came under scrutiny earlier this year, when an investigation by India Today proved that many witnesses who accused him of rape and other serious forms in their affidavits before the Supreme Court in 2003 were not even aware Is what he has alleged in his affidavits
 supreme court ne in shapath patron ke aadhaar par 2002 ke gujarat dangon ke 9 maamalon kii sunwaayee par roak laga di thi
 These witnesses were in the dark because the affidavits were in English, and they did not know English
 unhone sijepi ke aashwaasan par un par hastakshar kar die the
 The suspected role of the CJP was revealed earlier this year by an investigation by the Special Investigation Team (SIT) appointed by the Supreme Court
 shuruyaat main 20 gavaah pehle se taiyaar bayaan lekar esaity ke samaksh pesh hue, jisane unhen sweekaar nahin kiya or unase kaha ki unhen jo kahana he, ve siarpisi kii dhara 162 ke tahat police ko likhvaayen
 When the SIT started recording his statement, he found that there was a huge difference between his statement given to the police in 2002 and now
 ek darjan se zyada gavaahon ne esaity ko die bayaan main un baton se hi saaf inkaar kar diya, jo unhone 2003 main die apane shapath patron main kahi thim
 The cjp's repeated allegations that a Muslim woman Kausarbanu's fetus was ripped off by rioters proved to be false
 vaise, sijepi ke daaman par chhinte 2006 main bhi pade the, jab gujarat sarkaar ne is maanavadhikaaravaadi sanstha par nihit iraadon se sabooton se chhedchhad karne or 2002 ke panderwad narsanhaar main muslim danga peediton ko bhadakaane kaa aarope lagaaya or thos saboot bhi pesh kiye
 After Godhra, more than 20 Muslims were killed in Pandharwad village of Panchmahal district
 is cond main peediton ke rishtedaaron ne sijepi ke uksaave par maare gaye logon kii kabren khodakar kankal nikaal die the or aarope lagaaya tha ki narendra modi sarkaar ke sthaneey adhikariyon ne rishtedaaron ko bina bataae in logon ko dafna diya tha
 Setalvad then alleged, "there is evidence to prove that the authorities tried to cover up the killings
" ''jab modi sarkaar ne sijepi ke khilaaf aapraadhik aarope darj karne ke baad adaalat ke samaksh saare saboot pesh kar die to yah aarope galat sabit ho gaya
 Baqal Khan, "CJP always tried to widen the distance between the two communities
 hinduon or musalamaanon ko saarvajanik manch par laakar sampradayik sauharrd kaarykram yojit karne kaa meraa prastaav sijepi main thukraa diya gaya tha
 Setalvad's supporters strongly deny this
 udhar, bahut najdiki rahe hone se khan sitalwar ke kai raaj jaanate hai
 These include some of the alleged payment receipts that the CJP made to Muslim witnesses, which he claims to possess
 uske mutabik, uske paas sachitr pramaan he ki kis tarah sitalwar ne bhaajapa netaa vitthalbhai pandya ko, jinaki hatya ho chuki he, apane paale main lene kii naakaam koshishen kii thim
 Pandya's father was waging a campaign against Modi and according to Khan, Setalvad's attempt was to file a major case against Narendra Modi, his supporters and his bureaucracy in connection with the 2002 riots
 jab pandya ke pita iske liye sahamat na hue, to sitalwar ne 2002 ke dangon main maare gaye congress netaa ehsaan jaafaree kii vidhwaa jakiya jaafaree ko apane paksh main kar liya
 Apparently, Khan has a more serious anti-cjp spice, on which he is still silent
 jab sitalwar apane ek purv saathi ke saath uljhi hui hai, to aane vaale varshon main dilli main apane liye rashtriya bhoomika par drushti gadaaye gujarat ke mukhyamantri behad gajd hai
 this is due to
 modi kii chhavi sampradayik vibhajankarta ke taur par banane main sitalwar kii bhoomika sabase zyada rahi thi or is tarah se unhone modi kii rajnatik raah main baari avrodh paidaa kar die the
 But now that she has been exposed herself and is facing charges of misleading the courts, Modi's path automatically becomes easier

 vah pichley saal november kaa aakhri haftaa tha jab pradhanmantri guwahati va mendipathar (meghalaya) ke bich train ko hari jhandi dikhaate hue kah rahe the, “railway kii suvidhaayen 100 saal puraani dikhti hai
 Privatize railway stations
 unhen aadhunik banaaie
 Stations should be better than airports
 railway ko apni jameen par lagjri hotel banane ke liye nijee kshetra ko aamantrit karnaa chahie
 “those who understand the railways will believe that this was a big deal

 But within a month everything changed
 pradhanmantri ne varanasi ke dijal ingine kaarkaane pahunchane ke baad kaha, “railway ke nijeekaran ko lekar afvaahen failaai ja rahi hai, na maine kabhi aisa sochaa he or na kabhi karuunga
 "the U-turn on changing the railway was not only the first declaration of weakness in the Modi government's resolve for drastic reforms, but it also waned the expectations of a huge population who have no choice but to transport the railways and which the bullet train The dream was shown
 andaja nahin tha ki ki satta main aate hi railway main videshi nivesh kaa bigul bajaane vaali modi sarkaar kuch hi maheenon main itani dabbu ho jaaegi ki railway ke punargathan par baat karne se bhi daregi
 Even though the government may not be able to keep the railways from sliding, but the fact is that the improvement in railways is relatively easy
 railway ke paas sudhaaron ke kai blue print maujuud hai
 Seven committees have recommended reforms in the last two years
 bibek debaroy cameti to modi sarkaar ne hi banaai thi, jise railway main sudhaaron kii mahatvakankshi pahal mana gaya tha
 But by the time its interim report came out in March, the enthusiasm to change the railways had swallowed up unknown fears, so the committee in its final report softened the recommendation for outright reforms
 is mahakay parivahan company main sudhaaron par rajnatik sahmati bananaa mushkil nahin he
 The logic of change in Indian Railways will be embraced by even a common man, who throws it daily
 masalan, duniya main koun-si parivahan company 125 aspataal, 586 dawaakhaane chalaati hogi? yaa vishwa kii koun railway degree college or skool chalaa rahi hogi? swaabhaavik he ki train chalaanaa railway kaa kaam he, skool-aspataal chalaanaa nahin
 Similarly, no bus service or air service in the world would make buses and planes for itself or run roads and airports
 isliye jab debaroy samiti ne railway ke buniyadi dhaanche ko alag company ko saunpane, coach, ingine va dhura-pahiyaa banane vaali railway kii chah ikaayiyon ko milakar indian railway menuphaccharing company banane or skulon ko kendriya vidhyalay ko saunpane kii sifarish kii to sarkaar ko saanp soongh gaya
 The Debroy committee has suggested models for the reorganization of railways in Britain, Germany, Sweden, Australia, which are cited in Modi's address when he talked about modernizing the railway on the lines of Japan and China
 railway ko lekar doordarshita bhaashanon tak rah gai
 a big proof of this is the Dedicated Freight Corridor (DFC), which has been hanging since 2005
 yah project railway main maal parivahan ko tej gati kaa network dene ke liye bana
 With its introduction, the current network may be empty for passenger trains
 diefasi ke 3,300 kimi ke pashchim (haryana se maharashtra) or purv (punjab se pashchim bengal) galiyare sweekrut ho chuke hai

 modi sarkaar chaahati to inhen sakriy karne ke saath railway ko buniyadi dhaanche or menuphaccharing (mek in india) kaa jhandabardaar bana sakati thi
 In spite of all the rhetoric on the Prime Minister's emotional relationship with the railways, in the last one year, the government has put the files to sleep on almost all the preparations for reforms in the railways
 railway ke punargathan kii baat karnaa manaa he or nijeekaran kii charchaa par karant lagata he
 The Debroy Committee has recommended an independent regulator before the reforms in view of opposition to the recommendations of the interim report, which the government has been cutting
 bhartiya rail philhal sarkari beemaa companiyon se mili karj par chal rahi he or railway se lekar yatriyon tak sab jagah yah ehsaas gadha ho chalaa he ki railway main tej sudhaar dur kii kaudi hai

 To know the condition of Indian Railways, apart from traveling in trains in this scorching heat, there is another way that with the help of Google, you read Modi's speeches, which were given from election to power
 ye bhaashan desh kii sabase badi parivahan pranali main badlaav kii ummiido ke shikhar par chadhane or dhah jane kaa dastaveji saboot hai
 Among these, especially the speech of bjp's National Council at Ramlila Maidan in Delhi on January 19 last year, is the most important one from where the hope of change in the railway was raised
 tab modi ne kaha tha ki “hamaare paas vishaal railway network he, lekin durbhaagya se hamane is par dhyaan nahin diya
 If the railway is modern then we can give a new pace to development
 ” yah pehali baar tha jab koi satta kii taraf badhate ek rajnatik dal kaa sabase bada netaa railway main sudhaaron kii baat kar rahaa tha
 a year after the formation of the new government, if most of the hopes of reforms in railways are feeling extinguished today, then we have to accept that the plight of India's largest transport system is not just a result of the incompetence of previous governments

 The picture of Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on the stage was the most special
 darasal, isaki badi vajah bhi he
 Narendra Modi and Nitish Kumar are the two NDA leaders whose relationships have often seen ups and downs
 2002 main gujarat denge hue
 Not only did these riots become a topic of discussion all over the country, but it was also accused of failure to stop the riots on the then Modi government of the state
 godhra main jab train ko aag ke hawaale kiya gaya, tab centre main atal bihari vaajapeyi kii sarkaar thi or nitish kumaar rail mantri hua karte the
 As Prime Minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee asked the Gujarat government to follow Rajdharma and Nitish Kumar himself went to Gujarat for investigation and submitted his report
 iske baad ye bhi charchaa rahi ki godhra cese kanoon-vyavastha kaa masalaa tha, jo ki rajya sarkaar kaa vishay he
 Nitish Kumar and Narendra Modi's mutual relationship began to be discussed after the Gujarat riots, being part of the NDA
 2004 main atal sarkaar chali gai or 2005 main nitish kumaar ne mukhyamantri pad sambhalakar phir se bihar main vaapasi kar lee
 On the other hand, Narendra Modi continued to be the Chief Minister of Gujarat from 2002 to 2012
 lekin, koi aisa mauka dekhne ko nahin mila jab wo gujarat kii dharti par gaye or saath najar aae hon
 Although, outside Gujarat, the two leaders shared the stage together, but there was a lot of sourness on that too
 aisi ek tasviir may 2009 main ludhiana se saamne ai, jab tiares endie kaa hissaa bane
 Chief ministers of nda-ruled states, including senior BJP leaders, also reached the event
 inamen gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi or bihar ke siem nitish kumaar bhi the
 The two leaders not only shared the stage together, but also tried to show warmth in their relationships by holding each other's hands
 haalanki, is meeting se pehle nitish kumaar kii taraf se aisa bayaan saamne aayaa tha ki wo modi ke saath manch saajha nahin karenge
 After this the news also came that LK Advani, through Arun Jaitley, made a special request to Nitish Kumar to come to Ludhiana
 haalanki, jab donon manch par mili to modi ke haath main nitish kaa haath najar aayaa
 Dinner party canceled: Nitish Kumar's uneasiness came to the fore even after he shared the stage with Modi in Keludiana
 june 2010 main jab patna main bijepi rashtriya kaaryakarini kii baithak hui to phir donon netaaon ke bich kii kadavaahat kaa namoona dekhne ko mila
 Nitish Kumar canceled the proposed dinner party for BJP leaders
 khabar ai ki bihar main baadh prabhaviton kii madad ko lekar gujarat sarkaar ke vigyaapan se nitish kumaar khush nahin the
 The effect of this was that Nitish Kumar not only canceled the dinner but also returned the amount sent by the Gujarat government to the flood victims
 itnaa hi nahin saarvajanik taur par nitish kumaar baadh peediton kii madad ko maanviyata kaa aadhaar bataate hue us par prachaar kii aalochana karte rahe
 Even in Bihar, there was a lot of discussion about not allowing Narendra Modi to campaign
 iske baad 2014 loksabhaa chunaavon kii sargharmiyon ke bich bhi nitish kumaar or narendra modi ko lekar tamaam khabaren chalin
 On the one hand the BJP was planning to contest the Lok Sabha elections on Modi's face, on the other hand, questions were being asked to Nitish Kumar for the post of PM
 antat: sitambar 2013 main bijepi ne narendra modi ko pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar ghoshit kar diya, lekin isse pehle hi june 2013 main nitish kumaar ne bijepi se gathbandhan todane kaa elaan kar diya or endie se unka 17 saal purana rishta khatm ho gaya
 After defeating the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Nitish Kumar led the 'grand Alliance' and registered a resounding victory in the 2015 assembly elections
 mahagathbandhan main rashtriya janata dal or congress bhi shaamil thi
 But in July 2017, Nitish once left Lalu and Congress and joined the BJP
 haalanki, isse pehle hi modi or bijepi se unki dooriyaan kam hone kii tasviren aane lagi thim
 PM Modi went to Patna on the occasion of Prakash Parv and Nitish Kumar was seen laughing with him on the stage here
 lekin 2002 ke baad aaj aisa pehla mauka aayaa jab nitish kumaar gujarat gaye or narendra modi ke saath manch saajha kiya
 Former Haryana Congress President Ashok Tanwar has resigned from the party after getting angry
 unhone vidhansabha chunaav ko lekar baante ja rahe tikaton kii kharid-bikri kaa aarope lagaaya he
 Tanwar, in his resignation letter to Congress President Sonia Gandhi, alleged that a conspiracy was being hatched to end the party
 istipha dene ke baad ashok tanvar ne press conference kar congress ke hi netaaon par jamkar hamalaa bolaa, haalanki is dauraan unhone kisi kaa naam nahin liya lekin unka hamalaa kis taraf tha, siyaasi galiyaaron main isaki khulkar charchaa ho rahi he
 Ashok Tanwar told the communicators that for the last 5 years we were trying to strengthen the Congress in Haryana with sweat and blood
 lekin ab hamaari andekhi hui
 According to Ashok Tanwar, some of the party's leaders were politically murdered, while others are remaining, who said that among those murdered, i am (ashok Tanwar), Sanjay Nirupam and Ajay Kumar
 gaur he ki maharashtra main vidhansabha chunaav se pehle sanjay nirupam ne bhi naaraazgi jaahir karte hue khud ko congress ke chunaav prachaar se dur rakhane kaa elaan kiya he
 In the press conference, Tanwar said that some people are freeing the Congress inside the Congress
 bakaul tanvar, kuch log paanch saal asi kamaron main baithte hai, videshon main rahete hai or chunaav main prakat ho jate hai lekin aise netaaon ke karm devataaon vaale nahin balki rakshasi vaale hote hai
 Tanwar said that even though we were attacked, there was no help
 unhone talkh lahaze main kaha ki 24 oktober ko nattejey aaenge, 20 din main pataa chal jayega ki kuch log kitne bade netaa hai
 Tanwar, who was seen unhappy after resigning, alleged that ordinary family members do not get a chance, when they get, then everyday obstacles arise
 tanvar ne bataaya ki mujhe hataa diya lekin phir bhi ummid thi ki jin logon ne paanch saal mehnat kii unke saath nyaay hoga lekin aisa nahin hua
 i had decided to resign two days before but had stopped myself
 duusari partiyon main jane kii sugabugahat par tanvar ne saaf kiya ki main kahin nahin ja rahaa, bijepi se lekar kai partiyon se bulaava aayaa lekin main kahin nahin gaya
 a decision will be taken soon to consider the next step with your colleagues
 tanvar ne press conference ke dauraan rahul gandhi kaa bhi zikr kiya or kaha ki rahul ji ne jin netaaon ko aage badhaayaa unhen sajeesh ke tahat maarane kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 This is the third episode of Fake News
 badi chunauti he ki koi kaise pataa lagaae ki phek news he yaa nahin
 Inspired by the political ideology, many websites exist which are tricking you in disguise of the news organization
 bharat main is tarah kii kai website hai jinke naam is tarah se rakhe gaye hai jinhen dekhakar lagata he ki koi news sanghathan hoga
 The problem is that even after catching his theft, the cleaning that is done, he is not able to chase the lie that has gone too far
 phek news khaskar loktantric prakriya ko prabhavit karne laga he
 Through this, communal tension is being created somewhere, then the leader of any party is constantly being discredited
 soochnaaon ko pehle news kii shakl main bheja jaataa he
 After spreading it for several months, the same information is mocked and sent again so that you have been repeatedly seeing what Jawaharlal Nehru's real name was and where he came from
 15 may 2016 ko times of india kii amoolya gopalkrishnanan ne nehru ko failaaye ja rahe jhooth ko lekar ek report chhaapi
 Nehru could not escape the system of fake news
 jawahar ek arabi shabd kaa naam he, koi kashmiri brahman apane bachche kaa arabi naam rakh hi nahin saktaa he
 Nehru's grandfather was Ghiyasuddin Ghazi, the Kotwal of the Mughals who took his name Gangadhar Nehru
 nehru kaa janm elahabaad kii veshyatoli main hua tha
 After Nehru conceived a Catholic nun, the church sent the nun out of India for which Nehru remained grateful to the lifelong church
 pehle to yah sawaal aap khud se puuchhiye ki kya aapane kabhi whatsap yaa internet par nehru se sambandhit is tarah kii phek jaankaree dekhi he
 At the moment when Narendra Modi is ruling as the 16th Prime Minister in India, what could have interested anyone in the lineage of the first Prime Minister or to call him Mughal
 ek puraa raajnneetik tantra laga rahaa nehru ke bare main is tarah kii baton ko failaane main
 It had been going on for more than a year but when Amulya investigated these facts, it reached some people because by then altnews fighting the fake news gang
 in nahin aayaa tha
 Many videos have been made on youtube on Nehru, in which fake facts have been used
 ek video kaa zikr he jiskaa tital he hindustan kaa sabase ayyash aadmi
 Which was seen by 4 million people
 makasad he ki nehru kii saakh ko khatm karte rahaa jaae
 Nehru is constantly being maligned
 nehru duniya main nahin hai
 So there is no possibility of him becoming the Prime Ministerial election candidate in 2019, then why a political system continues to malign Nehru
 nehru ke bare main aisi galat soochnaaon ko news kii shakl main pesh kiya gaya taaki lakhon log dekh saken or nehru ke prati ghrinaa failati rahe
 Most of this was fake news
 makasad tha ki nehru ko kashmiri brahman se musalmaan bana do
 Tell me ek video main bataaya gaya he ki nehru kii maut aids se hui thi
 Nehru was depicted with pictures of Jacqueline Kennedy and Mrinalini Sarabhai
 photoshop kaa istemaal hua
 In Wikipedia, information about Nehru and his father Motilal Nehru was changed
 times of india ne Centre for Internet and Society ke pranesh prakaash ke hawaale se likhaa he ki sarkaar ke ypi adress se yah badlaav kiya gaya

in has a news report dated 24 January 2016
 jab netaji ke paper saarvajanik kiye gaye to unamem se kuch bhi khaas nahin niklaa magar uske hawaale se nehru ke nakli patr banaakar whatsap ke zariye baanta jane laga jiske jhaanse main patrkaar tak aa gaye
 When it was found out, everyone started deleting and apologized
 jabaki is tarah kaa koi patr hi nahin tha
 It is also a form of fake news
 aaj ke samay aapako phek news dena or itihaas ke tathyon ko bhi phek kar dena
 Think of it this way, you will neither be able to know about today, nor about yesterday
 internet par nehru ke bare main phek jaankariyaan bhari ja rahi hai
 When your child downloads for school college project, he will write wrong information
 ho saktaa he ki raajnneetik vichaardhaara se prerit shikshak unheen jaankariyon par use number bhi de den or wo puri zindagi is yakeen main jeeta rahegaa ki jo jaanata he vah sahi tha jabaki wo phek tha
 Fake news and fake videos have led to communal violence, murder and property damage
 lekin isi phek news ke zariye itihaas kii sabase badi hinsa se judi jaankaree ko hi mitaane kii koshish kii gai
 You saw last week that Prime Minister Modi visited the Holocaust Memorial on the Israeli tour
 jahaan unhone itihaas kaa ek krurtam adhyay bataaya tha
 But Carole Cadwallader of the Guardian newspaper notices that on Google's search that Did the Holocaust really happen? So the answer is that the Holocaust had not happened and the search result was a newly Nazi website stormfront
 org par le jaataa he jahaan is tarah kii baaten likhi hai ki chotii ke das kaaran ki holocost hua hi nahin tha
 In his article dated 11 December 2016, Carroll talks about this in a Guardian newspaper
 unhone bataaya he ki you tub par bhi is tarah ke kai video hai
 Whereas books and historical documents state that Hitler killed six million people
 carol ne jab yah sawaal uthaaya to uske baad google ne sudhaar kar diya lekin sochiye internet par aise kitne aitihaasik saakshyon ko badal diya gaya hoga
 Just as governments change the history books
 aap sochate hai ki yah aapke or aapke bachche ke liye mahatvapurn sawaal nahin he
 Is Apa such a sensible parent who wants to give his children a legacy of fake news and fake history
 ham phek news kii series main algoritham par bhi baat karne kaa prayaas karenge jiske zariye in sab tathyon ko badalakar google search main sabase upar kar diya jaataa he
 If you are reading fake history about whatsapp Nehru and Holocaust, when your child also comes with the same fake information, then you might say that wow how sensible it has become
 jo main jaanata hum vahi ye bhi jaanata he
 Millions of people are sharing such fake history, fake news
 pichley saal bazafid naam kii website ne 5 badi phek news kii ek list banaai thi jo is prakaar he
 - Obama has given orders to stop taking oath of allegiance in all schools of the country
 ise fasebuk par 21 lakh baar share kiya gaya
 - Pope Francis supported Donald Trump's candidacy, it was shared 9 million times
 ek or dilachasp tathy he
 Tom Reilly of the American newspaper The Sun Chronicle wrote in an editorial on June 29, 2017, that even a large organization like the Associate Press has fallen victim to fake news
 jabaki yah sanstha 171 saal puraani he, duniya bhar ke 1700 akhbaaron, 5000 tivi or radio broadcast api kii story chhapati he
 So imagine where fake news would reach
 ye us sanstha kaa haal he jiske 120 deshon main 243 news beuro hai
 Even if we mix eight ten TV channels of India, there will not be so many reporters
 associated press ne yah baat sweekaar kii he ki uski kuch aisi khabaren bhi thim jo news nahin thim
 Therefore, AP has launched a new news feature Not Real News
 iske tahat aisi phek news kaa pardaafaash kiya jayega jo twitor yaa duusare plateform par viral huin
 Yet this work is also like clearing a big lake with a sieve
 phek news ek vyapak shrenee he
 It has many sub-disciplines
 ek shakha he phek tasveeron kii
 From the tweets of many leaders to the report of the government, fake pictures are reached and from there among you people, wow look what a scene
 haal hi main bharat ke grahamantralay kii 2016-17 kii salanaa report ke pej number 40 par yah jaankaree di gai ki antarrashtriya seemaa he, vahaan par 2043 kimi tak tej raushnee kii vyavastha karne kii manzuri pradaan kii he, sirf 100 kimi hi kaam baaki rah gaya he
 The rest is done
 ise dikhaane ke liye grahamantralay kii report main ek tasviir lagaai gai jiske neeche likhaa hua he seemaa par tej raushnee kii vyavastha
 Which you will see and understand that it has become awesome
 lekin jab 14 june ko altnews
 in was surprised to see this photo printed as a lie
 aakhir grahamantralay kii report main phek tasviir kaise ja sakati he
 Where did i come from? kya ye report google search karke banaai ja rahi thi
 altnews reported that this photo is of the Spanish Morocco border
 ganimat he ki grahamantralay ke grihasachiv ne zaraa bhi deree nahin kii
 Our colleague Nita Sharma reported that when the Home Secretary sought clarification from the officials involved in the preparation of the report, it was found that this picture had come from BSF
 grihasachiv ne iske liye afsos jataayaa or salanaa report ke online sanskaran se tasviir hataa lee gai he
 But this picture was present for three months
 jane kahaan kahaan pahunch gai hogi
 If Alt News reported in its report that hindutwa
 info par ise lekar sarkaar kii uplabdhi ke rup main prachaarit karne kaa shuru ho gaya
 It was written that the work of completely sealing the indo-pak and indo-bangladesh border is also going on vigorously and soon the borders will become much safer than before
 ek kaam karne vaali sarkaar ko aisa karte dekhte hue kaaphi acha ahsaas hota he
 
 
 Not only this, i am going to discuss two tweets of BJP MP Paresh Rawal
 pehla twit 3 july kaa he
 MP Paresh Rawal shared a statement of former President APJ Abdul Kalam on the Twitter handle
 likhaa ki ye chhadam libral logon ke liye he
 Later it was discovered that that statement was not from Kalam
 "is bayaan main likhaa tha ki mujhe pakistan ne islam kaa hawala dekar milaane kaa prayaas kiya lekin maine mathrubhumi ke saath gaddari nahin kii
 "when there was an uproar, Paresh Rawal said that i did not know it was fake
 agar inaki jagah koi or hota to main ise do baar check karata magar kalam kii vajah se mujhe yah sahi laga
 It is quite possible that this has happened and it happens
 koi bhi aisi tasveeron or bayanon ke jhaanse main aa jaataa he
 But when he made a tweet about famous writer Arundhati Roy, many dangerous aspects came out of it
 17 may 2017 ko paresh rawal ne twit kiya ki arundhati roy ne intervyuu diya he ki 70 lakh bhartiya sena kashmir ke azaadi gang ko haraa nahin sakati
 With this, he put a picture of Arundhati Roy, in which she is placed in front of the army jeep
 ise lekar kai bade news channelon par baqayda bahes ho gai
 The debate was such that the crowd could be aggressive against Arundhati Roy
 jabaki arundhati raay na to haal main srinagar gayi thim or na hi aisa koi intervyuu kisi ko diya tha
 Arundhati Roy did give an interview to Outlook magazine a year ago, but Paresh Rawal's tweet was not about that interview
 24 may ko thewire
 in When it came to know how information reached Paresh Rawal, another dangerous aspect of fake news came to light
 tippaniyan Paresh Rawal tweeted this fake interview of Arundhati Roy from the Facebook page named The Nationalist
 is pej par khabar pahunchi postcard
 From the news, many news of this website has been disputed in relation to fake news
 is par likhaa tha ki arundhati roy ne yah intervyuu The Times of Islamabad ko diya he ki 70 lakh bhartiya sena kashmir ke azaadi gang ko haraa nahin sakati hai
 postcardnews did not reveal its source but The Wire found that Radio Pakistan had aired it all before
 jis The Times of Islamabad ko pakistani akhbaar bataaya ja rahaa he, wo website he, akhbaar nahin he
 postcard
 news ne jis din ye phek intervyuu chapa tha usee din ise satyavijayi
 com also published and four five websites also gave it their place
 in sabhi kaa naam bhi phek news ke silsile main aa chukaa he
 thewire
 in pakadaa ki internethindu
 in gave a link to the Times of Islamabad in his story
 aap dekhiye ki kis tarah pakistani site se chalate hue phek news phek intervyuu bharat ke saansad ke twitor handle par pahunchataa he or vahaan se bharat ke channelon par arundhati roy ke kilaaf zordaar bahes chhid jaati he
 Paresh Rawal deleted the tweet but even today this fake interview radio pakistan website and post card of India
 news par tasviir ke saath he
 It is also a strategy
 jab vivaad tham jayega to phir se is phek intervyuu ko ghumaya jane lagegaa
 Or what the address is being rotated in whatsapp University
 aap sochiye yah kitna khataranaak pahalu he
 India and Pakistan websites can also help each other in the case of fake news
 koi aapke naam se pakistan main phek intervyuu chhapava de, jab tak aap safai denge, tivi channel, netaa or ye website milakar aapkaa bhayankar nuksaan kar chuke honge
 Right now, those who raise their voice are being intimidated, weak and timid opposition is being intimidated, but soon you will also be fixed through this game
 balki kiya bhi ja rahaa he
 First of all, ask yourself this question whether you have ever seen such fake information related to Nehru on whatsapp or Internet
 is vakt jab bharat main 16wein pradhanmantri ke rup main narendra modi kaa shashan chal rahaa he tab kisi ko pehle pradhanmantri kii vanshavali yaa unhen mogul bataane main kya dilchaspee ho sakati thi
 An entire political system was employed to spread such things about Nehru
 saal bhar se zyaada samay se chal rahaa tha lekin jab amoolya ne in tathyon kii jaanch kii tab kuch logon tak yah baat pahunchi kyonki tab tak phek news ke giroh se ladane vaala altnews
 did not come in you tub par bhi nehru ko lekar kai tarah ke video banaaye gaye hai jinamein phek tathyon kaa istemaal kiya gaya he
 There is a reference to a video whose title is the best man in India
 jise 40 lakh logon ne dekha tha
 The aim is to keep Nehru's credibility going
 nehru ko lagaataar badnaam kiya ja rahaa he
 Nehru is not in the world
 isliye 2019 main unke pradhanmantri kaa chunaav ummidavaar banane kii koi sambhaavna bhi nahin he phir ek raajnneetik tantra kyon nehru ko badnaam karata ja rahaa he
 Such misinformation about Nehru was introduced in the form of news so that millions of people could see it and the hatred towards Nehru continued to spread
 inamen se adhikansh phek news tha
 The motive was to convert Nehru from a Kashmiri Brahmin to a Muslim
 ayyash bataa do
 a video states that Nehru died of AIDS
 jacleen kennedy or mrinalini sarabhai kii tasviren lagaakar nehru ko ayyash dikhaaya gaya
 Photoshop was used
 vikipedia main nehru or unke pita motilaal nehru ko lekar jaankariyaan badal di gayi
 The Times of India, quoting Pranesh Prakash of the Center for Internet and Society, wrote that the change was done with the government's IP address
 24 janvari 2016 kii scrol dot in kii ek khabar he
 When Netaji's papers were made public, nothing special came out of them, but quoting Nehru's fake letters, he started distributing them through whatsapp, in which the journalists came under the scanner
 jab pataa chalaa to sabane dilit karnaa shuru kar diya or maafee maangani shuru kar di
 Whereas there was no such letter
 phek news kaa ek rup yah bhi he
 In today's time, give you fake news and also throw away the facts of history
 sochiye is tarah se aap na to aaj ke bare main sahi jaan paayenge, or na beete hue kal ke bare main
 Fake information about Nehru is being filled on the Internet
 aapkaa baccha skool college ke project ke liye jab downlod karegaa to galat jaankariyaan likh aayega
 It is possible that a teacher inspired by political ideology will give him the number on the same information and he will live his whole life in the belief that what he knows was right while he was fake
 phek news or phek video ke kaaran kai jagah sampradayik hinsa hui he, hatya hui he or sampattiyon ko nuksaan bhi pahunchaa he
 But through this fake news, an attempt was made to erase the information related to the biggest violence in history
 aapane pichley hafte hi dekha tha ki pradhanmantri modi isroyal daure par holocost memorial gaye the
 Where he told a cruel chapter of history
 lekin gardian akhbaar kii carol cadwolder ne notice kiya ki google ke search main yah daalane par ki Did the Holocaust really happen? to jawaab aata he ki holocost hua hi nahin tha or search riselt ek nav naatzi website stormfront
 takes us to the org where such things are written that the top ten reasons why the Holocaust had not happened
 11 disambar 2016 ke apane lekh main carol ne is par vistaar se baat kii he jo gardian akhbaar main chapa he
 He has told that there are many such videos on youtube
 jabaki kitabon or aitihaasik dastavezon main yah baat darz he ki hitler ne saath lakh logon ko marava diya tha
 When Carroll raised this question, Google made improvements after that, but imagine how many such historical evidence on the Internet would have been changed
 usee tarah jaise sarkarein itihaas kii kitabon ko badal detii hai
 You think that this is not an important question for you and your child
 kya aapa itane samajhadaar mata pita hai jo apane bacchon ko phek news or phek history kii viraasat khushi khushi dena chahta he
 We will also try to talk about the algorithm in the Fake News series, through which all these facts are changed to the top of Google search
 aap whatsap nehru or holocost ke bare main phek history pard rahe hai, aapkaa baccha bhi jab vahi phek jaankaree lekar aayega to ho saktaa he ki aap kah den ki vaah kitna samajhadaar ho gaya he
 i also know what i know
 lakhon log is tarah kii phek history, phek news share kar rahe hai
 Last year, a website called Buzzfeed made a list of 5 big fake news which is as follows
 - obama ne desh ke sabhi skulon main nishtha kii shapath lene par roak lagane ke aadesh de diye hai
 It has been shared 21 million times on Facebook
 - pope francis ne donald trump kii ummidavaari kaa samarthan kiya, ise 9 lakh baar share kiya gaya
 There is another interesting fact
 amareeki akhbaar The Sun Chronicle ke Tom Reilly ne 29 june, 2017 ko apane ek sampadakeey main likhaa ki associadet press jaisi badi sanstha bhi phek news kaa shikaar hui he
 While the institution is 171 years old, the story of 1700 newspapers, 5000 TV and radio broadcast aps around the world is published
 to sochiye kahaan kahaan phek news pahunch jaataa hoga
 This is the condition of the organization which has 243 news bureaus in 120 countries
 bharat ke aath das tivi channel mila denge to bhi itane reporter nahin honge
 The Associated Press has admitted that it had some news which was not news
 isliye api ne ek nayaa news feechar shuru kiya he Not Real News
 Under this, such fake news will be exposed which went viral on Twitter or other platforms
 phir bhi yah kaam ye bhi kisi badi jhil ko chalni se saafe karne jaisaa he
 Fake news is a broad category
 isaki kai upashakhaayen hai
 There is a branch of fake pictures
 kai netaaon ke twit se lekar sarkaar kii report tak main phek tasviren pahunch jaati hai or vahaan se aap logon ke bich ki vaah dekho kya nazaaraa he
 Recently, on the page number 40 of the 2016-17 Annual Report of the Home Ministry of India, it was informed that there is an international border, it has been approved to arrange 2043 km of bright light there, only 100 km is left
 has gone
 baaki ho gaya he
 To show this, a picture was put in the report of the Ministry of Home Affairs, below which is written the arrangement of fast light at the border
 jise aap dekhakar samajhenge ki vaah ye to kamaal hi ho gaya
 But when altnews on 14 June
 in ne is tasviir ko jhooth bataate hue report chhaapi to sab hairaan rah gaye
 After all, how can a fake picture go in the report of the Home Ministry? ai kahaan se
 Was this report made by searching Google? altnews ne bataaya ki yah tasviir spain morocco seemaa kii he
 It is a matter of fact that the Home Secretary of the Home Ministry did not delay at all
 hamaari sahyogi nita sharma ne report kii ki grihasachiv ne report kii taiyaari se jude adhikariyon se safai maangi to pataa chalaa ki biguef se ye tasviir ai thi
 The Home Secretary expressed regret for this and the picture has been removed from the online version of the annual report
 magar teen maheene se yah tasviir maujuud thi
 Know where you must have reached
 agar alt news ne apni report main bataaya he ki hindutwa
 The information started to be promoted as an achievement of the government
 likhaa gaya ki bharat-paak or bharat-bangladesh seemaa ko puri tarah se sil karne kaa kaam bhi jor se chalaa hua he or jald hi simaaen pehle kii apeksha kaaphi zyaada surakshit ho jaaengi
 Seeing a working government do this makes one feel quite good
 
 
 yahi nahin, bijepi ke saansad paresh rawal ke do twit kii charchaa karne ja rahaa hum
 The first tweet is on July 3
 saansad paresh rawal ne purv raashtrapati e pi je abdul kalam kaa ek bayaan twitor handle par share kar diya
 Wrote that this pseudo is for the Liberal people
 baad main pataa chalaa ki wo bayaan kalam kaa tha hi nahin
 "it was written in this statement that i tried to reconcile Pakistan by citing Islam but i did not betray the motherland
 " jab hangaamaa hua to paresh rawal ne kaha ki mujhe pataa nahin tha ki yah phek he
 If there was someone else in their place, i would have checked it twice, but because of Kalam i felt it right
 yah bilkul mumkin he ki aisa hua he or aisa ho jaataa he
 Anyone gets caught in such pictures and statements

 Many big news channels got debated about this

 While Arundhati Roy neither went to Srinagar recently nor gave any such interview to anyone
 arundhati raay ne ek saal pehle outluk patrika ko zarur intervyuu diya tha magar paresh rawal kaa twit us intervyuu ko lekar nahin tha

 If you are reading fake history about whatsapp Nehru and Holocaust, when your child also comes with the same fake information, then you might say that wow how sensible it has become
 jo main jaanata hum vahi ye bhi jaanata he
 Millions of people are sharing such fake history, fake news
 pichley saal bazafid naam kii website ne 5 badi phek news kii ek list banaai thi jo is prakaar he
 - Obama has given orders to stop taking oath of allegiance in all schools of the country
 ise fasebuk par 21 lakh baar share kiya gaya
 - Pope Francis supported Donald Trump's candidacy, it was shared 9 million times
 ek or dilachasp tathy he
 Tom Reilly of the American newspaper The Sun Chronicle wrote in an editorial on June 29, 2017, that even a large organization like the Associate Press has fallen victim to fake news
 jabaki yah sanstha 171 saal puraani he, duniya bhar ke 1700 akhbaaron, 5000 tivi or radio broadcast api kii story chhapati he
 So imagine where fake news would reach
 ye us sanstha kaa haal he jiske 120 deshon main 243 news beuro hai
 Even if we mix eight ten TV channels of India, there will not be so many reporters
 associated press ne yah baat sweekaar kii he ki uski kuch aisi khabaren bhi thim jo news nahin thim
 Therefore, AP has launched a new news feature Not Real News
 iske tahat aisi phek news kaa pardaafaash kiya jayega jo twitor yaa duusare plateform par viral huin
 Yet this work is also like clearing a big lake with a sieve
 phek news ek vyapak shrenee he
 It has many sub-disciplines
 ek shakha he phek tasveeron kii
 From the tweets of many leaders to the report of the government, fake pictures are reached and from there among you people, wow look what a scene
 haal hi main bharat ke grahamantralay kii 2016-17 kii salanaa report ke pej number 40 par yah jaankaree di gai ki antarrashtriya seemaa he, vahaan par 2043 kimi tak tej raushnee kii vyavastha karne kii manzuri pradaan kii he, sirf 100 kimi hi kaam baaki rah gaya he
 The rest is done
 ise dikhaane ke liye grahamantralay kii report main ek tasviir lagaai gai jiske neeche likhaa hua he seemaa par tej raushnee kii vyavastha
 Which you will see and understand that it has become awesome
 lekin jab 14 june ko altnews
 in was surprised to see this photo printed as a lie
 aakhir grahamantralay kii report main phek tasviir kaise ja sakati he
 Where did i come from? kya ye report google search karke banaai ja rahi thi
 altnews reported that this photo is of the Spanish Morocco border
 ganimat he ki grahamantralay ke grihasachiv ne zaraa bhi deree nahin kii
 Our colleague Nita Sharma reported that when the Home Secretary sought clarification from the officials involved in the preparation of the report, it was found that this picture had come from BSF
 grihasachiv ne iske liye afsos jataayaa or salanaa report ke online sanskaran se tasviir hataa lee gai he
 But this picture was present for three months
 jane kahaan kahaan pahunch gai hogi
 If Alt News reported in its report that hindutwa
 info par ise lekar sarkaar kii uplabdhi ke rup main prachaarit karne kaa shuru ho gaya
 It was written that the work of completely sealing the indo-pak and indo-bangladesh border is also going on vigorously and soon the borders will become much safer than before
 ek kaam karne vaali sarkaar ko aisa karte dekhte hue kaaphi acha ahsaas hota he
 
 
 Not only this, i am going to discuss two tweets of BJP MP Paresh Rawal
 pehla twit 3 july kaa he
 MP Paresh Rawal shared a statement of former President APJ Abdul Kalam on the Twitter handle
 likhaa ki ye chhadam libral logon ke liye he
 Later it was discovered that that statement was not from Kalam
 "is bayaan main likhaa tha ki mujhe pakistan ne islam kaa hawala dekar milaane kaa prayaas kiya lekin maine mathrubhumi ke saath gaddari nahin kii
 "when there was an uproar, Paresh Rawal said that i did not know it was fake
 agar inaki jagah koi or hota to main ise do baar check karata magar kalam kii vajah se mujhe yah sahi laga
 It is quite possible that this has happened and it happens
 koi bhi aisi tasveeron or bayanon ke jhaanse main aa jaataa he
 But when he made a tweet about famous writer Arundhati Roy, many dangerous aspects came out of it
 17 may 2017 ko paresh rawal ne twit kiya ki arundhati roy ne intervyuu diya he ki 70 lakh bhartiya sena kashmir ke azaadi gang ko haraa nahin sakati
 With this, he put a picture of Arundhati Roy, in which she is placed in front of the army jeep
 ise lekar kai bade news channelon par baqayda bahes ho gai
 The debate was such that the crowd could be aggressive against Arundhati Roy
 jabaki arundhati raay na to haal main srinagar gayi thim or na hi aisa koi intervyuu kisi ko diya tha
 Arundhati Roy did give an interview to Outlook magazine a year ago, but Paresh Rawal's tweet was not about that interview
 24 may ko thewire
 in When it came to know how information reached Paresh Rawal, another dangerous aspect of fake news came to light
 tippaniyan Paresh Rawal tweeted this fake interview of Arundhati Roy from the Facebook page named The Nationalist
 is pej par khabar pahunchi postcard
 From the news, many news of this website has been disputed in relation to fake news
 is par likhaa tha ki arundhati roy ne yah intervyuu The Times of Islamabad ko diya he ki 70 lakh bhartiya sena kashmir ke azaadi gang ko haraa nahin sakati hai
 postcardnews did not reveal its source but The Wire found that Radio Pakistan had aired it all before
 jis The Times of Islamabad ko pakistani akhbaar bataaya ja rahaa he, wo website he, akhbaar nahin he
 postcard
 news ne jis din ye phek intervyuu chapa tha usee din ise satyavijayi
 com also published and four five websites also gave it their place
 in sabhi kaa naam bhi phek news ke silsile main aa chukaa he
 thewire
 in pakadaa ki internethindu
 in gave a link to the Times of Islamabad in his story
 aap dekhiye ki kis tarah pakistani site se chalate hue phek news phek intervyuu bharat ke saansad ke twitor handle par pahunchataa he or vahaan se bharat ke channelon par arundhati roy ke kilaaf zordaar bahes chhid jaati he
 Paresh Rawal deleted the tweet but even today this fake interview radio pakistan website and post card of India
 news par tasviir ke saath he
 It is also a strategy
 jab vivaad tham jayega to phir se is phek intervyuu ko ghumaya jane lagegaa
 Or what the address is being rotated in whatsapp University
 aap sochiye yah kitna khataranaak pahalu he
 India and Pakistan websites can also help each other in the case of fake news
 koi aapke naam se pakistan main phek intervyuu chhapava de, jab tak aap safai denge, tivi channel, netaa or ye website milakar aapkaa bhayankar nuksaan kar chuke honge
 Right now, those who raise their voice are being intimidated, weak and timid opposition is being intimidated, but soon you will also be fixed through this game
 balki kiya bhi ja rahaa he

 You see how the fake news fake interview going through the Pakistani site reaches the Twitter handle of the MP of India and from there a fierce debate is started against Arundhati Roy on the channels of India
 paresh rawal ne twit dilit kar diya lekin aaj bhi yah phek intervyuu radio pakistan kii website or bharat ke post card
 News is on the picture
 yah bhi ek ranneeti he
 When the controversy stops, this fake interview will start to be revived
 yaa kya pataa whatsap uniwarsity main ghumaya hi ja rahaa ho
 Think about what a dangerous aspect this is
 phek news ke maamle main bharat or pakistan kii website bhi ek duusare kii madad kar sakati hai
 Someone will get a fake interview printed in Pakistan in your name, by the time you give cleanliness, TV channels, politicians and these websites together will have done you a terrible loss
 abhi to iske zariye awaz uthaane waalon ko daraaya ja rahaa he, kamazor or darpok vipaksh ko daraaya ja rahaa he lekin jaldi hi is khel ke zariye aap logon ko bhi fiks kiya jane lagegaa
 It is also being done
 associated press ne yah baat sweekaar kii he ki uski kuch aisi khabaren bhi thim jo news nahin thim
 Therefore, AP has launched a new news feature Not Real News
 iske tahat aisi phek news kaa pardaafaash kiya jayega jo twitor yaa duusare plateform par viral huin
 Yet this work is also like clearing a big lake with a sieve
 phek news ek vyapak shrenee he
 It has many sub-disciplines
 ek shakha he phek tasveeron kii
 From the tweets of many leaders to the report of the government, fake pictures are reached and from there among you people, wow look what a scene
 haal hi main bharat ke grahamantralay kii 2016-17 kii salanaa report ke pej number 40 par yah jaankaree di gai ki antarrashtriya seemaa he, vahaan par 2043 kimi tak tej raushnee kii vyavastha karne kii manzuri pradaan kii he, sirf 100 kimi hi kaam baaki rah gaya he
 The rest is done
 ise dikhaane ke liye grahamantralay kii report main ek tasviir lagaai gai jiske neeche likhaa hua he seemaa par tej raushnee kii vyavastha
 Which you will see and understand that it has become awesome
 lekin jab 14 june ko altnews
 in was surprised to see this photo printed as a lie
 aakhir grahamantralay kii report main phek tasviir kaise ja sakati he
 Where did i come from? kya ye report google search karke banaai ja rahi thi
 altnews reported that this photo is of the Spanish Morocco border
 ganimat he ki grahamantralay ke grihasachiv ne zaraa bhi deree nahin kii
 Our colleague Nita Sharma reported that when the Home Secretary sought clarification from the officials involved in the preparation of the report, it was found that this picture had come from BSF
 grihasachiv ne iske liye afsos jataayaa or salanaa report ke online sanskaran se tasviir hataa lee gai he
 But this picture was present for three months
 jane kahaan kahaan pahunch gai hogi
 If Alt News reported in its report that hindutwa
 info par ise lekar sarkaar kii uplabdhi ke rup main prachaarit karne kaa shuru ho gaya
 It was written that the work of completely sealing the indo-pak and indo-bangladesh border is also going on vigorously and soon the borders will become much safer than before
 ek kaam karne vaali sarkaar ko aisa karte dekhte hue kaaphi acha ahsaas hota he
 
 
 Not only this, i am going to discuss two tweets of BJP MP Paresh Rawal
 pehla twit 3 july kaa he
 MP Paresh Rawal shared a statement of former President APJ Abdul Kalam on the Twitter handle
 likhaa ki ye chhadam libral logon ke liye he
 Later it was discovered that that statement was not from Kalam
 "is bayaan main likhaa tha ki mujhe pakistan ne islam kaa hawala dekar milaane kaa prayaas kiya lekin maine mathrubhumi ke saath gaddari nahin kii
 "when there was an uproar, Paresh Rawal said that i did not know it was fake
 agar inaki jagah koi or hota to main ise do baar check karata magar kalam kii vajah se mujhe yah sahi laga
 It is quite possible that this has happened and it happens
 koi bhi aisi tasveeron or bayanon ke jhaanse main aa jaataa he
 But when he made a tweet about famous writer Arundhati Roy, many dangerous aspects came out of it
 17 may 2017 ko paresh rawal ne twit kiya ki arundhati roy ne intervyuu diya he ki 70 lakh bhartiya sena kashmir ke azaadi gang ko haraa nahin sakati
 With this, he put a picture of Arundhati Roy, in which she is placed in front of the army jeep
 ise lekar kai bade news channelon par baqayda bahes ho gai
 The debate was such that the crowd could be aggressive against Arundhati Roy
 jabaki arundhati raay na to haal main srinagar gayi thim or na hi aisa koi intervyuu kisi ko diya tha
 Arundhati Roy did give an interview to Outlook magazine a year ago, but Paresh Rawal's tweet was not about that interview
 24 may ko thewire
 in When it came to know how information reached Paresh Rawal, another dangerous aspect of fake news came to light
 tippaniyan Paresh Rawal tweeted this fake interview of Arundhati Roy from the Facebook page named The Nationalist
 is pej par khabar pahunchi postcard
 From the news, many news of this website has been disputed in relation to fake news
 is par likhaa tha ki arundhati roy ne yah intervyuu The Times of Islamabad ko diya he ki 70 lakh bhartiya sena kashmir ke azaadi gang ko haraa nahin sakati hai
 postcardnews did not reveal its source but The Wire found that Radio Pakistan had aired it all before
 jis The Times of Islamabad ko pakistani akhbaar bataaya ja rahaa he, wo website he, akhbaar nahin he
 postcard
 news ne jis din ye phek intervyuu chapa tha usee din ise satyavijayi
 com also published and four five websites also gave it their place
 in sabhi kaa naam bhi phek news ke silsile main aa chukaa he
 thewire
 in pakadaa ki internethindu
 in gave a link to the Times of Islamabad in his story
 aap dekhiye ki kis tarah pakistani site se chalate hue phek news phek intervyuu bharat ke saansad ke twitor handle par pahunchataa he or vahaan se bharat ke channelon par arundhati roy ke kilaaf zordaar bahes chhid jaati he
 Paresh Rawal deleted the tweet but even today this fake interview radio pakistan website and post card of India
 news par tasviir ke saath he
 It is also a strategy
 jab vivaad tham jayega to phir se is phek intervyuu ko ghumaya jane lagegaa
 Or what the address is being rotated in whatsapp University
 aap sochiye yah kitna khataranaak pahalu he
 India and Pakistan websites can also help each other in the case of fake news
 koi aapke naam se pakistan main phek intervyuu chhapava de, jab tak aap safai denge, tivi channel, netaa or ye website milakar aapkaa bhayankar nuksaan kar chuke honge
 Right now, those who raise their voice are being intimidated, weak and timid opposition is being intimidated, but soon you will also be fixed through this game
 balki kiya bhi ja rahaa he
 Fake news is a broad category
 isaki kai upashakhaayen hai
 There is a branch of fake pictures
 kai netaaon ke twit se lekar sarkaar kii report tak main phek tasviren pahunch jaati hai or vahaan se aap logon ke bich ki vaah dekho kya nazaaraa he
 Recently, on the page number 40 of the 2016-17 Annual Report of the Home Ministry of India, it was informed that there is an international border, it has been approved to arrange 2043 km of bright light there, only 100 km is left
 has gone
 baaki ho gaya he
 To show this, a picture was put in the report of the Ministry of Home Affairs, below which is written the arrangement of fast light at the border
 jise aap dekhakar samajhenge ki vaah ye to kamaal hi ho gaya
 But when altnews on 14 June
 in ne is tasviir ko jhooth bataate hue report chhaapi to sab hairaan rah gaye
 After all, how can a fake picture go in the report of the Home Ministry? ai kahaan se
 Was this report made by searching Google? altnews ne bataaya ki yah tasviir spain morocco seemaa kii he
 It is a matter of fact that the Home Secretary of the Home Ministry did not delay at all
 hamaari sahyogi nita sharma ne report kii ki grihasachiv ne report kii taiyaari se jude adhikariyon se safai maangi to pataa chalaa ki biguef se ye tasviir ai thi
 The Home Secretary expressed regret for this and the picture has been removed from the online version of the annual report
 magar teen maheene se yah tasviir maujuud thi
 Know where you must have reached
 agar alt news ne apni report main bataaya he ki hindutwa
 The information started to be promoted as an achievement of the government
 likhaa gaya ki bharat-paak or bharat-bangladesh seemaa ko puri tarah se sil karne kaa kaam bhi jor se chalaa hua he or jald hi simaaen pehle kii apeksha kaaphi zyaada surakshit ho jaaengi
 Seeing a working government do this makes one feel quite good
 
 
 yahi nahin, bijepi ke saansad paresh rawal ke do twit kii charchaa karne ja rahaa hum
 The first tweet is on July 3
 saansad paresh rawal ne purv raashtrapati e pi je abdul kalam kaa ek bayaan twitor handle par share kar diya
 Wrote that this pseudo is for the Liberal people
 baad main pataa chalaa ki wo bayaan kalam kaa tha hi nahin
 "it was written in this statement that i tried to reconcile Pakistan by citing Islam but i did not betray the motherland
 " jab hangaamaa hua to paresh rawal ne kaha ki mujhe pataa nahin tha ki yah phek he
 If there was someone else in their place, i would have checked it twice, but because of Kalam i felt it right
 yah bilkul mumkin he ki aisa hua he or aisa ho jaataa he
 Anyone gets caught in such pictures and statements

 arundhati raay ne ek saal pehle outluk patrika ko zarur intervyuu diya tha magar paresh rawal kaa twit us intervyuu ko lekar nahin tha

 Uday Narayan Chaudhary, a senior JDU leader and two-time speaker of the Bihar Legislative Assembly, and the party's general secretary and former minister Shyam Razak have sparked a revolt against the Bihar government and the party
 sarkaar par hamalaa bolne ke liye in donon netaaon ne daliton kii andekhi kaa mudda uthaaya he
 Uday Narayan Chaudhary belongs to the Mahadalit caste and Shyam is a Rajakpachchhi caste

 Raising the issue of Dalits, both these leaders have said that the Bihar government is not serious about the development of Dalits and is constantly ignoring them
 nitish kumaar par shyaam rajak ne kaha he ki aazaadee ke 70 saalon ke baad bhi ambedkar or mahatma gandhi kadaliton ko mukhyadharaamein laane kaa jo sapana tha vah puraa nahin ho paaya he
 In view of the condition of Dalits in Bihar, Shyam Rajak has said that the state government has to work for the upliftment of Dalits, but it seems that the intention of the state government is not right
 udai narayan choudhary or shyaam rajak ke baagi tevar ko dekhte hue jediu ne bhi unke khilaaf kadi karrwai karne ke sanket die hai
 JDU President of Bihar Pradesh Vashistha Narayan Singh has said that the party is keeping an eye on the activities of Jai Narayan Chaudhary and Shyam Rajak

 bihar sampark kranti train main enditivi ke sahyogi saurabh shukla ne vot daalane ja rahe yatriyon se khaas baatcheet kii
 During this time, he tried to know from many travelers about their issues and problems in the Lok Sabha elections
 maaloom ho ki aakhir ke do charnon main purvi uttar pradesh or bihar kii kai siton par matdaan hone vaala he
 In such a situation, thousands of laborers living in Delhi and NCR are going to their village to vote in General Bogi in a bad situation
 bheed itani he ki bogi ke shauchalay main log baithkar vot daalane ja rahe hai
 We also traveled with workers to General Bogi and tried to bring his position to you

 Somehow after entering the general bogie, we started with the bogie toilet where two Siwan youth Rahul and Nand Kumar were going to vote in the toilet due to lack of space
 21 saal ke rahul kaa kahana he ki wo apane vot kii keemat samajhate hai or lagbhag 20 ghante toilat main khadey hokar sirf isliye chaahate hai ki agle paanch saal main bhartiya rail kuch general bogi badha de, taaki tyoharon se lekar vot daalane ke liye unhen agali baar toilet main khadey hokar apane gaanv na janaa pade

 National Conference leader Farooq Abdullah has supported US President Donald Trump's statement that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had sought help to resolve the Kashmir issue
 haalanki bhartiya videsh mantralay ne is baat kaa khandan kiya he ki pradhanmantri narendra modi ne trump se kashmir mudde par kuch aisa kaha he
 Farooq Abdullah said that it is heartening that PM Modi spoke to President Trump on the Kashmir issue and said that the Kashmir issue is complex
 agar aise main madad aati he, to yah acha hoga
 In another tweet, he said that i want to congratulate Prime Minister Narendra Modi that he also wants this issue to be resolved at all costs
 isse bharat or pakistan ke bich jari vivaad sulajhegaa
 Farooq Abdullah has praised PM Modi's alleged statement
 vahiin pidipi kii netaa or jammu kashmir kii purv mukhyamantri mahabuuba mufti ne kaha ki bhale hi jammu-kashmir par kisi tisare paksh ke dakhal se bharat sarkaar ne khandan kiya he lekin raashtrapati trump kaa is mudde par zikr vyapak taur par niti parivartan ko darshata he
 The history of America is not such that it has played an important role in resolving the ongoing disputes between the two parties, but we want the two countries to resolve this dispute through mutual negotiations
 raashtrapati trump ne mehmaan pakistani pradhanmantri imran khan ke saath somvaar ko ek press conference main daawa kiya ki pradhanmantri modi ne pakistan se vivaad main madhyasthata karne ke liye kaha he
 India immediately rejected Trump's statement
 videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa raveesh kumaar ne twit kiya, "pradhanmantri narendra modi ne america raashtrapati se aisa koi aagrah nahin kiya
 "showing the zeal of the Prime Minister of Pakistan to resolve the Afghanistan war, Trump also described himself as a mediator in the Kashmir issue
" ek vakt tha, jab rome ke badshaah nero ne hukum diya tha, "unhen bhojan do, unhen manoranjan do
 
 
 "and since then, all authoritarianists have also used theatricality when seeking support on the basis of public expectations, but no one has done it in India like Narendra Modi did with his red turban, waving arms, curved air Apart from talking, he made his speech by reaching it far and wide through big screens
 lekin usamen sarpurn kya tha
 
 
 The His Independence Day speech was like an old wine in an old bottle, with only the label new
 unke dwaara saarvajanik manch se janata ke saamne shauchalayon kii baat karne ko lekar kaaphi kuch kaha ja rahaa he
 But what did he add to the 'nirmal Bharat Abhiyan' program announced last year by his predecessor Dr
 Manmohan Singh in lieu of 'total Sanitation Program'? nothing
 
 
 darasal, safai par dhyaan dena hameshaa se hamaare prabud netaaon kii praathamikta rahaa he, jinamein mahatma gandhi bhi shaamil the, jinhone dakshin africa main na sirf khud jhaadu uthaaya, balki kasturba se bhi apana mailaa khud saaf karne ke liye kaha
 He said, "keeping cleanliness is like devotion to God
 
 
 ", lekin aisa unhone lalakile kii pracheer par chadhakar nahin kaha tha, balki unhone andruni vinamrata darshaate hue, aadambarrahit tareeke se swayan se or apane parivaar se shuruyaat kar ek vyaktigat udhaaharan prastut kiya
 Certainly the framework of their entire 'positive program' revolves around personal and social hygiene
 hamen modi dwaara shauchalayon kaa mahatv samajhaae jane kii nahin, is baat kii zarurat thi ki vah aakar sampurna swatchta kii disha main kii gai pragati ke bare main bataaen, or yah bataaen ki dashakon puraane nirmal gram abhiyaan ke raste main kya rukaawatein aa rahi hai
 If Modi had done a little study instead of chanting new slogans as per his nature, he would have known that building toilets with MPLAD fund, as i was doing at the time when Modi was wearing khaki nikar Was engaged in giving publicity and preaching, the problem is not because it is easy to do, but the problem comes in ensuring their maintenance
 aise saarvajanik shauchalay jis vakt banaae jate hai, us vakt to aisa lagata he, jaise tajmahal bana diya gaya, lekin ek hi hafte main vah istemaal ke laayak bhi nahin rahete, kyonki rakrakhaav kii koi uchit vyavastha nahin hoti
 And if Modi had any time and desire to read the recent surveys, he would have known that even if public toilets were replaced with private toilets in homes, we have here to motivate them to use them continuously The system is lacking
 so, jab samaaj ko prerit karnaa hi sabase badi chunauti dikh rahaa ho, sabase aasaan or prabhavi raah he ki panch or sarpanch gramsabhaaon ke jariye safai kaa mahatv samajhaayen
 But if we follow Modi's Independence Day speech, it is clear that he did not even listen to his 'gujarati brother' Mohandas Karmchand Gandhi who said that India cannot progress without Panchayat Raj
 zaahir he, koi sattavadi aasaani se shaktiyon ke bantwaare ke liye kaise taiyaar ho saktaa he? aisa bhi nahin he ki hamen is baat kii ashanka nahin thi
 As far as Panchayat Raj is concerned, Modi's Gujarat is one of the worst performing states
 or yah ek baar phir siddh ho gaya, jab unhone 'saansad adarsh gram yojana' kaa nirarthak prastaav rakhaa, jise saansadon ko apane empilad fund se chalaanaa he
 First of all, think about how 700 'adarsh adarsh' villages will help in solving the huge problems that seven lakh villages are facing
 iske baad, sochane ke liye zyaada mahatvapurn baat yah he ki 'saansad kaarykram' kyon, 'panchayat adarsh gram yojana' kyon nahin? panchayaton ke jariye is yojana ko lagu karne par ise desh ke prayek gaanv tak turant pahunchaaya ja saktaa tha, basharte aavashyak prakriyaayein, paisa or padaadhikariyon ko uchit adhikaar dekar samvidhan ke tahat gaanvon ko prabhavi dhang se shaktishaalee banaaya jaae
 Ahh! People's empowerment is not going to happen in Modi's 'new India', but it seems, everything is moving towards giving Modi the status of 'saint'
 bilkul yahi baat modi kii un upadeshaatmak, parantu arthhin tippaniyon par bhi lagu hoti he, jinamein unhone balaatkaar tathaa mahilaon kaa yon utpeedan rokane ke liye mata-pitaaon se putr-putriyon par ek-si paabandiyaan lagane ke liye kaha
 He would have heard it much more effectively at the time if he had expelled Nihalchand Meghwal from his cabinet, for making more effective law and order for the safety of women in public places and for taking strict judicial action against criminals in time
 Taking more practical steps (apart from hanging 16-year-old criminals)
 parantu yadi vyavhaar main laae ja sakane laayak koi road-map taiyaar ho to unhen modi koun kahe
 He only preaches, he does nothing
 gandhi ne kaha bhi, or naitik shuddhta kaa ooncha udhaaharan bhi prastut kiya
 He said it and did it, but Modi repeatedly speaks only, and continues to give childish slogans
 narendra modi ke inhen bachakaane naaron kii kadi main 'mek in india' tazatreen he
 Even if 'swavalamban' and 'swadeshi' are not 'make in India', what else is there? And if Modi was trying to invite foreigners to invest in the construction sector in his own wrong English, then what is new in that? We have also been attracting foreign investors extensively since the time of economic reforms started during the era of PV Narasimha Rao and his Finance Minister Manmohan Singh
 mote taur par safalataa bhale hi hamase dur rahi ho, lekin hamaare share bazaaron main dhan kaa shandaar pravaah, khaastaur se badnaam morishas root ke jariye, kai guna badha
 Despite the reforms, if the FDI in the construction sector has been disappointing, it is not because the UPA government has failed to create slogans, but rather that political, social, social and social reforms are on the way to open rules and regulations governing foreign investment
 And the economic hurdles - the real hurdles - are
 yadi modi main in sabhi niyamon ko khatm kar dene kii himmat (yaa bevakoofi) hoti, to unhen videshi puunji ko aakarshith karne ke liye khokhale naaron kii zarurat hi na padati
 But since he knows that his saffron brigade will not allow him to take any revolutionary steps, instead of any meaningful change in policies, foreign investors received just one more slogan from Modi
 or isamen hairaani kii koi baat nahin ki swatantraaa diwas kii purv sandhya par 'da neuyark times' ne modi ko 'shunya' (cipher) kii sangya de daali
 'zero' proved once again, with another slogan - a 10-year moratorium on communalism
 yah sawaal uthaane se main parhez karuunga, kyonki ise kai log uthaa chuke hai ki sirf 10 saal kyon, hameshaa ke liye kyon nahin? isse kahin behatar yah hota ki ki modi unki nazaron ke saamne gujarat main hue muslimon ke narsanhaar ke liye maafee maang lete, or sabhi bhagwaton, togadiyaon or kodenaniyon kii saarvajanik rup se nakel kasate, jinase vah ghire rahete hai, or jinaki raajnneeti ke jariye hi vah rescorse road tak pahunch paae hai
 Can he deny them? Does he want to deny them? Before the elections in Uttar Pradesh, is he ready to promise that he will bring out every 'nickel-man' involved in the pre-election communal violence? No, because if they did, the Sangh Parivar would throw them out first
 modi shakespeare ke upanyaas ke charitra ladi makebeth kii tarah hai - "mere haath khun se range hai, or kisi bhi tarah kaa itr inamen se vah gandh nahin nikaal saktaa
 
 
 "(here's the smell of the blood still: all the perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little hand)
" ant main baat karte hai yojana ayog kii
 There may be a debate about ending it, but Modi did not do that
 nehru yug kii sabase shandaar paramparaon main se ek ko khatm kar dene kii unki koshish ke adiyalpane ke alaava hamen kuch hasil nahin hua
 This is exactly what the Sultan of Delhi used to do
 ve pichhali sabhi murtiyon tudwa diya karte the, lekin is todphod kii koi safai kabhi nahin de paae
 Abolishing the Planning Commission, without elaborating on what is to come in its place, is the same as if a child intentionally breaks his toys just because he enjoys doing so
 hamen zarurat he ki lalakile kii pracheer par vayaskon jaisaa vyavhaar lautakar aae
 We need one Jawaharlal Nehru, who declared the nation's 'good luck'
 hamen zarurat he ek bahadur shastri kii, jo 'jai jawan jai kisaan' kaa naaraa de rahe hon
 We need an Indira Gandhi, who united the whole country against the ongoing genocide in neighboring East Pakistan
 hamen zarurat he ek rajeev gandhi kii, jo assam samjhaute kii ghoshnaa kare, punjab samjhaute ko aage badaye, mizo samjhaute kii bhavishyavaanee kare
 We need a Narasimha Rao to present a roadmap to lead the country on the path of prosperity
 hamen atal bihari vaajapeyi ke vinamr hasya kii bhi zarurat he, hamen dow manmohan singh kii samya vaani kii bhi zarurat he
 Ahh! In the coming five years (excluding the past 70 days), hoping for any of them is like aspiring for the moon

 ladakh se loksabhaa sadsy jamyang tsering namagyal ne kaha ki kai log unke kshetra main aakar kaarobaari sambhaavnaaon kaa laabh uthaanaa chaahate hai, lekin kshetra main sirf un logon kaa swaagat he jo vastav main sansaadhaanon kaa laabh uthaanaa chaahate hai or uskaa durupyog nahin karenge
 In an event in Maharashtra, he said that those who want to use the resources of Ladakh for selfishness are not welcome in the region
 kaarykram ke dauraan namagyal ne kaha, ‘anuchhed-370 or 35e hataane ke baad kai log kaarobaari sambhaavnaaon ko talashne ke liye ladakh aana chaahate hai
 There are two types of people in it
 kuch log kshetra kii sambhaavnaaon kaa istemaal karnaa chaahate hai jabaki kuch swaarthee uddeshy se sansadhano kaa dohan karnaa chaahate hai, jo log kaarobaari sambhaavnaaon ke liye aana chaahate hai unka swaagat he
 Namgyal strongly supported the decision taken by the Center on Jammu and Kashmir in Parliament and appealed to the youth to participate in nation building
 unhone kaha, ‘kuch log jo khud asurakshit mahasoos karte hai ne purvaagrah bana liya he ki raajnneeti ganda khel he jo sach nahin he
 'let us tell you that on August 5, the Central Government had abolished most of the provisions of Article 370 giving special status to Jammu and Kashmir and decided to divide the state into two Union Territories, Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself took to the field today to campaign for the first phase of Gujarat elections and started his campaign by taking four rallies one after the other
 pehle charan kii voting 9 disambar ko honi he
 The special thing is that for the first time the Prime Minister has addressed his meetings completely in Gujarati
 ye bataata he ki pradhanmantri kaa target varg is samay puri tarah se gujarati janata he

 baahar rahane vaale ye gujarati vot bhale na daalane aaen lekin ve kuch votaron ko party ke paksh main prabhavit karne kii kshamta rakhe ho sakate hai

 He gave the entire speech here in his mother tongue
 pradhanmantri ne kaha ki gujarat chunaav logon ke bijepi ke vikaas ke agenda main bharose or congress kii vanshavaad kii raajnneeti ke bich he

 Gujarat will never accept this

 In this 42-minute speech, Modi did not speak a single line in Hindi
