 is vijan statement main samruddhi or shanti ke liye saajha prayaas karne kaa aahvaan kiya gaya he
 Chaudhary Pushpendra Singhganna farmers feared what the Yogi government did under pressure from the sugar industry lobby
 sarkaar ne gat varsh kii tarah is varsh bhi ganna mulya main koi badhotaree nahin kii jabaki chini udyog kii sthiti desh or antarrashtriya str par is saal bilkul badal gai he
 With this decision of the government, there has been disappointment among the sugarcane farmers with anger
 jis josh ke saath ganna kisaanon ne samarthan dekar 2017 main bijepi kii sarkaar banavaai thi, ab ve khud ko thaga sa mahasoos kar rahe hai
 The state of the sugar industry, which has been troubled by excessive sugar production and huge sugar reserves for the last two years, has changed this year
 is saal kam chini utpaadan hone or antarrashtriya bazaar main adhik maang ke kaaran chini udyog ko to puri raahat milegi parantu ganne ke rate naa badhaane se ganna kisaanon kii sthiti kaise sudharegi?2018-19 main desh main chini kaa aarambhik bhandar (opening stock) 104 lakh ton, utpaadan 332 lakh ton, gharelu khapat 255 lakh ton or niryaat 38 lakh ton rahaa
 Thus, in the current sugar year 2019-20, the initial reserves of sugar is 143 lakh tonnes
 atah hamaari lagbhag saat maheene kii khapat ke baraabar chini pehle hi godaamon main rakhi hui he
 Till a few months ago this was a very worrying situation in view of which the government had given many incentives to the sugar mills to make ethanol instead of sugar
 parantu pehle sookhe or baad main atyadhik bemausam barish ke kaaran desh main ganne kii fasal ko kaaphi nuksaan hua
 With this, sugar production in Maharashtra is expected to come down from last year's 107 lakh tonne to 55 lakh tonne and in Karnataka to decrease to 33 lakh tonne from 44 lakh tonne
 isma (indian sugar mills association) ke anusaar, desh main is varsh chini kaa utpaadan pichley varsh ke mukaable 21 pratishat ghatakar lagbhag 260 lakh ton hone kaa anumaan he jo gharelu bazaar kii khapat ke liye hi paryaapt hoga
 In the first two months of october-november of the current sugarcane year 2019-20, sugar production in the country has come down by more than half to around 19 lakh tonnes as compared to about 41 lakh tonnes in the previous year
 2019-20 main vishwa main chini kaa utpaadan 1,756 lakh ton or maang 1,876 lakh ton rahane kii sambhaavna he
 That is, production is estimated to be less than 120 lakh tonnes
 is kaaran is varsh anterrashtriya bazaar main chini kii acchhee maang hogi jisaki aapurti ham kar sakate hai
 Due to the possible reduction in sugar production in the international market, our mountain-sugar reserves have suddenly turned into good news
 uttar pradesh ke chini udyog kaa is sthiti main sabase zyada laabh hoga kyonki pichley saal kii tarah is saal bhi chini utpaadan main pratham sthaan par uttar pradesh hi rahegaa jahaan 120 lakh ton chini utpaadan kaa anumaan he
 Last year, farmers in Uttar Pradesh supplied sugarcane worth about Rs 33,000 crore to sugar mills
 parantu isamen se aaj bhi kisaanon kaa lagbhag 3000 karod rupee se zyada kaa ganna bhugtan bakaayaa he
 For the last two years, sugar mills have been postponing payment of farmers on the one hand citing excessive sugar production and replenished stocks, on the other hand, the government did not raise sugarcane prices
 kendra sarkaar ne july main varsh 2019-20 ke liye ganne kaa etharapy (uchit evam laabhakaari mulya) 10 pratishat kii aadhaar recovery ke liye 275 rupee prati quintal ghoshit kiya tha
 In the year 2018-19 also the FRP of the central government was the same but the base recovery rate was 9
 5 pratishat thi
 This year the real value of sugarcane has come down due to increase in base recovery rate and the effect of inflation
 yahi haal uttar pradesh main bhi rahaa jahaan esaypi (rajya paraamarshit mulya) pichley do saalon se 315-325 rupee prati quintal ke str par hi he
 But now the situation of production of both sugarcane and sugar has changed in the country and international market due to which the sugarcane price should have been increased
 pichley dinon uttar pradesh sarkaar ne 2019-20 ke ganna mulya nirdhaaran ke liye sabhi hitdharakon se vichaar vimarsh kiya tha
 In this meeting, the Uttar Pradesh Sugar Mills Association once again raised the demand for not increasing the sugarcane rate this year by showing its poor economic condition, excessive sugar production and fear of reserves
 kisaanon kaa kahana he ki do saalon se ganne ke rate nahin badhaaye gaye hai jabaki laagat kaaphi bad gai he
 The cost of production of sugarcane is about Rs 300 per quintal
 sarkaar ke laagat ke dedh guna ke vaayade ko bhul bhi jaaen to bhi badali paristhiti main kam se kam 400 rupee prati quintal kaa bhav milanaa chahie tha
 Even if an increase was made at a nominal rate of 10 per cent in the last two years, even then the rate of Rs 400 per quintal would have been automatically increased at this rate
 vaastaviktaa to yah he ki chini milen chini ke sah-utpaadon jaise shira, khoi (bagas), presmad aadi se bhi acchhee kamai karti hai
 Apart from these by-products, ethanol, bio-fertilizer, plywood, electricity and other products are also made and sold
 ganna (niyantran) aadesh ke anusaar chini milon ko 14 dinon ke andar ganna bhugtan kar dena chahie
 Interest is also payable at the rate of 15 percent per year for delay in payment
 parantu chini milen saal-saal bhar ganna bhugtan nahin karatin or kisaanon kii is puunji kaa bina byaaj diye istemaal karti hai
 In this way, mills also save the interest of banks
 pichley do saalon main sarkaar ne chini milon ko anek protsaahan package bhi die hai iske baavjood bhi milon ne ganne kaa samay par bhugtan nahin kiya
 In order to deal with the problem of sugarcane suffering every year and not getting good prices to the farmers, we also have to consider a separate policy regarding sugar industry
 desh main chini kaa 75 pratishat upyog vyavsaayik pratishthanon dwaara kiya jaataa he jisamen chocolate, peya padaarth, chyavanprash, zeus, mithai, aais-kriim, biscuit aadi nirmaataa shaamil hai
 These drinks-foods contain up to 60 percent sugar, which is sold to consumers at very expensive prices
 jis prakaar vyavsaayik upyog vaale gas silinder kaa rate gharelu istemaal vaale silinder se zyada hota he usee prakaar vyavsaayik istemaal hone vaali chini kaa rate gharelu se zyada tay kar diya jaae to chini milon or ganna kisaanon donon kii samasya kaa hal ho saktaa he
 Secondly, like Brazil, we should use sugarcane in a controlled manner to make sugar, ethanol or other products according to the market demand
 isse ek to atyadhik chini utpaadan se bachaa ja saktaa he or doosraa ethnaul kaa prayog petrol main milakar petroleum padaarthon ke aayaat main kharch hone vaali videshi mudra ko bhi kuch bachaaya ja saktaa he
 This will also reduce air pollution
 ye donon kadam desh, sarkaar, kisaan or chini udyog ke hit main hai
 Sugarcane prices have not been raised for the last two years in view of higher production
 mahangaai dar ke prabhaav ke kaaran vaastavik daam ghat gaya he
 Given the low sugar production and good international demand in the changed circumstances, the government should have ensured remunerative sugarcane prices, but now the sugar mills will take full advantage of this situation and the farmers will feel nothing but despair
 yadi sarkaar ab bhi uparokt kuch kadam uthaae to alag se bonus dekar ganna kisaanon ko badahaali se bachaaya sakati he
 Sugarcane price is a very sensitive political issue with the livelihood of crores of people
 sarkaar ne tatkaal prabhaav se pahal nahin kii to badi raajnneetik keemat chukaani pad sakati he

 isse india today kii sahmati aavashyak nahin he)*** Human rights activist Teesta Setalvad got relief from arrest till 19 February from Supreme Court
 aaie samajhate hai ki aakhir kya he puraa maamla or kyon tista ke khilaaf karrwai par vivaad khadaa ho rahaa he
 Teesta Setalvad has been helping the riot victims in Gujarat since 2002
 unke enjio ne kai saare maamalon main peediton kii taraf se kanoonee ladaai ladi he or kai aropiyon ko sajaa dilaane main ahm bhoomika nibhaai he or to or, narendra modi ko jis vajah se vishesh jaanch dal (esaiti) ke saamne pesh hona padaa tha, uske peeche bhi tista hi thim
 Zakia Jafri, wife of former MP Ehsan Jafri, who was killed in the Gulberg Society, had alleged in the Supreme Court that Narendra Modi was responsible for the riots
 isi kii jaanch ke liye esaiti ne narendra modi se poochtacha bhi kii thi
 For the first time, he had to appear before any commission of inquiry
 esaiti ne modi se poochtacha ke baad unako clinit de di thi
 Now Zakia is challenging this clean chit in the High Court
 ab aate hai maujuuda maamle par
 The case is to build the Rait Museum in Gulberg Society
 gulburg socity ke kareeb 20 ghar philhal khandhar bane hue hai
 Except Qasim Mansoori in one house and the remaining houses are still burnt, ruined
 tista ne yah ghoshnaa kii thi ki yahaan dangon main maare gaye logon kii yaad main ye museum banaaya jayega
 For this, those who have houses here, had asked to buy it at the market price
 lekin phir zamin ke daam agle 3-4 saalon main behad bad jane kii vajah se yah yojana thande baste main pad gai
 During this time some riot victims of Gulberg Society accused Teesta that they had deposited a large amount of money to build the Rait Museum, out of which they had spent some money for their personal benefit
 aisi ek arzi krime branch ko bhi saunpi gai
 The crime branch also registered an FIR in this case and started investigating
 krime branch ne kaha ki tista ne kareeb 10 karod rupee kaa chanda jamaa kiya or usamen se 3-4 karod rupee apane nijee phaayde ke liye kharch kiye
 Teesta has been questioned in this matter
 krime branch unhen giraftaar karnaa chaahati he
 Teesta went to the Gujarat High Court for anticipatory bail against him, from where his petition was dismissed
 krime branch kuch hi minute baad ahmedabad se 400 kilometre dur mumbai main unke ghar giraftaari ke liye pahunch gai
 Teesta was not found there and after a few hours, she was arrested by her lawyers from the Supreme Court
 is bich gulburg socity main bhi do kheme ho gaye hai
 a big group is still saying that Teesta has done a lot for them and they have not done any kind of embezzlement
 lekin fariyadi kah rahe hai ki unhen nyaay mili iske liye jaruri he ki tista kii giraftaari ho
 Teesta's lawyers said in the Supreme Court that the case being told is not as big as it is
 unka daawa he ki maamla karodon kaa nahin, mahaj chaar lakh kaa he or sirf modi sarkaar ke khilaaf insaaf kii ladaai ladane kii keemat tista adaa kar rahi hai
 But the eyes are on the Supreme Court amid these allegations and counter-allegations
 vahaan aaropon se zyaada saboot ahmiyat rakhte hai
 Both sides have to present evidence to prove their allegation

 Meenu Sur, general secretary of the Domestic Women Workers Union, said, "there are currently around 10,000 women members in cities like Kanpur, Lucknow, Sitapur, Allahabad, Hardoi, Unnao in the state

 He said that just days, there are incidents of maids stealing goods from the house
 lekin union ke jariye logon ko bharosemand naukaraani milegi
 The union will also have complete information and accountability of the maid concerned

 At that time, he did not expect that his start would take the form of such a large organization
 unhone union kaa gathan ek saal pehle kiya
 Asked how he thought of forming a union? He said, "usually women working in most cities are victims of exploitation
 tay se zyada kaam karwaane ke baavjood unhen uchit mehtaanaa nahin diya jaataa
 In view of this, i felt that an organization should be created to protect them from exploitation
 " gharelu kaam karne vaali mahilaon ko union main panjikaran karaane ke liye pehali baar 13 rupee shulk dena hoga
 After that a fee of Rs 12 per year will have to be paid
 union balshram ke khilaaf he or isliye isamen naaballig bacchiyon kaa panjikaran nahin kiya jaataa
 He said that the union members would help the women workers fully if they did not pay the wages fixed by the owner and received complaints of exploitation

 shodhakartaaon ne paaya ki college laayak umr ke sharmile log dusron ke chehron par dukh or dar ke bhaavon ko un logon ke mukaable aasaani se pahchaan lete hai jo sharmile nahin hote
 The lead researcher of this study, Graves o'hever, described the results of this study as shocking
 kyonki pichley adhyayan main paaya gaya tha ki sharmile log baaki logon ke chehre ke haavbhaav kaa sahi arth nahin nikaal pate
 According to the news, Graves says the previous study was done on children
 dusron ke chehron ke haavbhaav ko samajhane kii unki kabaliyat umr ke saath behatar ho sakati he
 a positive aspect of people's shyness has emerged in this new study
 is shodh ke liye grevs ne college ke 241 vidhyaarthiyon main online surveykshan ke jariye mili jaankaree kaa adhyayan kiya
 The average age of the students involved in the study was 19 years
 in vidhyaarthiyon ko 110 tasviren dikhaakar poocha gaya ki koun si tasviir koun sa bhav pradarshit kar rahi he? in vidhyaarthiyon ke sharmilepan ke str kaa pataa lagane ke liye inase poocha gaya ki kya ve anjaan logon ke saath pareshaan mahasoos karte hai? yaa kya ve kisi se soochna maangana mushkil samajhate hai? yaa kya unhen partiyon main janaa asuvidhajanak lagata he?is adhyayan main paaya gaya ki in vidhyaarthiyon ne dikhaai gai tasveeron main se chehre ke bhaavon ko 81 pratishat tak sahi pahachaanaa tha
 People who had more shyness were able to recognize feelings of sadness and fear more accurately than others
 jab in logon se poocha gaya ki unhen adhyayan ke dauraan kaisaa laga to adhiktar sharmile log kharaab mood main the
 On this, Graves says that when a person's mood is bad, he sees only the bad side of others
 sambhav he tabhi inhone chehron ke kharaab haav bhav ko aasaani se pahchaan liya ho
 The Supreme Court's decision to revoke the Central Vigilance Commissioner deputation is going to create a lot of trouble for the Manmohan Singh government from a political point of view
 sheersh adaalat ne paaya ki sivisi ke pad parapije thomski niyukti galat tareeke se kii gai
 Since his appointment has been invalidated by the court, the abstraction of the ABVVC is of no use
 ek ore court ne yah paaya ki thomas vyaktigat taur par bhale hi eemaandaar ho sakate hai, lekin sansthagat taur par unki niyukti doshamukt nahin thi
 It was because of this that a charge sheet was filed against him in the palmolein oil scam in Kerala
 ve us e
 During Raja's tenure, he was also the telecom secretary, who has been arrested in the 2G allocation scam
 saath hi supreme court ne bhavishya main sivisi kii niyukti ke bare main disha-nirdesh bhi die hai
 From now on, if any member of the High Powered Panel, which includes the Prime Minister, the Home Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, disagrees with the appointment of the CVC, it will be necessary to record the reason for the disagreement and the Government will have to respond to it
 isse puri prakriya kii nyaayik punarikshan sunishchit ho sakegi
 Along with this, it has also been decided by the direction of the court that now such an appointment will be made only from Amrai
 maujuuda netaa vipaksh sushamaa swaraj ne pije thomas kii niyukti par asahmati jataai thi, lekin behad sankshipt baithak main isaki vajah nahin darj karai ja saki thi
 The latest decision of the court will determine transparency and accountability in the appointment of CVC
 abhi bhale hi yah faisla sarkaar ke liye sharmindagi kaa sabab bana ho, par bhavishya ke iske achche parinaam honge

 a day before the meeting of the Working Committee to be held for the new president of Congress, senior party leader Abhishek Manu Singhvi said on Friday that there should be a selection of a president who can agree
 unhone nae adhyaksh ke chayan ke liye party ke bheetar chunaav kii prakriya apnaane par jor dete hue yah bhi kaha ki is chayan main ab jaraa bhi der nahin honi chahie
 Singhvi tweeted and said, "the Congress president who has agreed on Saturday should be selected
 jaraa si deree bhi ab vikalp nahin he
 In fact, the Congress has convened a meeting of the Working Committee of the Party (CWC) on 10 August, trying to end the confusion and leadership crisis created after Rahul Gandhi's resignation as the party's president
 loksabhaa chunaav ke nattejey aane ke baad gat 25 may ko hui seedblusi kii baithak main gandhi kii ore se istife kii peshkash ke baad se seedblusi kii agali baithak or agle adhyaksh ko lekar lagaataar atakalein lagaai ja rahi thim

 party ke nae adhyaksh ko lekar mallikarjun khadge, ashok gahalot, susheel kumaar scindia sahit kai varisht netaaon ke naamon kii charchaa bhi hui
 At the same time, senior party leader and Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh first talked of handing over the responsibility of party president to a young leader and then advocated the name of General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra
 vaise, congress ke kai duusare netaa bhi adhyaksh pad ke liye priyanka ke naam kii pairvi kar chuke hai
 Rahul Gandhi resigned from the post of the party's president after the Congress' debacle in the Lok Sabha elections
 us vakt unke istife ko asweekaar karte hue seedblusi ne unhen party main amulchul badlaav ke liye adhikrut kiya tha, haalanki gandhi apane rukh par ade rahe or spasht kar diya ki na to vah or na hi gandhi parivaar kaa koi doosraa sadsy is jimmedaari ko sanbhaalega
 While announcing his resignation, Gandhi had also said that he would continue to work actively for the party despite not being the Congress president 
 unke samarthan main bahut saare netaaon ne bhi istipha de diya tha
 Since Gandhi's resignation, there has been a constant confusion in the party about the election of the next president
 nae adhyaksh ko chunane ke liye kai daur kii baithken huin lekin kisi naam par sahmati nahin ban pai

 The Lokpal Bill was once again hanged on Thursday
 aisa pehali baar nahin he jab rajyasabha main dinabhar chali charchaa ke baad bhi lokapal bill paarit nahin ho paaya
 The history of 40 years of Parliament is a witness that this bill remains a puzzle
 guuruuvaar raat rajyasabha kii kaarywahi bina lokapal or lokayukta vidheyak, 2011 paarit hue anischitkaal ke liye sthagit kar di gayi
 It is an interesting coincidence that till now whenever the Lokpal Bill was considered in the Parliament, the proceedings of the Lok Sabha had been postponed
 1968 se aisa hi dekhne main aayaa he
 The Lokpal and Lokayukta Bill was introduced on May 9 that year
 ise sansad kii sthai samiti ko bheja gaya
 On 20 August 1969, it was passed as the 'lokpal and Lokayukta Bill, 1969'
 haalanki rajyasabha main yah vidheyak paarit hota usase pehle chauthi loksabhaa kii kaarywahi sthagit ho gayi or vidheyak latak gaya
 After this, on August 11, 1971, the Lokpal and Lokayukta Bill was again brought
 ise naa to kisi samiti ko bheja gaya or naa hi kisi sadan ne ise paarit kiya
 After the term of the fifth Lok Sabha ended, it became ineffective
 uske baad 28 july, 1977 ko lokapal vidheyak ko laayaa gaya
 It was referred to the Joint Committee of both the Houses of Parliament
 sanyukt samiti kii siforeeshon par vichaar karne se pehle hi chhathi loksabhaa sthagit ho gayi or vidheyak bhi latak gaya
 The Lokpal Bill, 1985 was introduced on 28 August that year and referred to the Joint Committee of Parliament
 haalanki tatkaaleen sarkaar ne anek kism ke halaat ko cover karne main khaamiyon ke chalate use waapas le liya
 Withdrawing the bill, the then government said that it would bring a comprehensive bill later with redress of public grievances
 varsh 1989 main yah vidheyak phir aayaa or 29 disambar ko use pesh kiya gaya
 However, after the adjournment of the Ninth Lok Sabha on 13 March 1991, the bill became neutral
 sanyukt morcha kii sarkaar ne bhi 13 sitambar, 1996 ko ek or vidheyak pesh kiya tha
 He was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee of the Ministry of Home Affairs related to the Department for investigation and report

 Coal was also illegally extracted under the ground just below the college, the tunnel continued to be built and now the college could collapse
 college aadharahin ho chukaa he, aadmi kaa aadhaar number ban rahaa he, college aadharahin ho chukaa he
 The tunnel is so deep that the water level below the college went further deep, so there is no water in the toilet

 As soon as we came towards the toilet, it seemed that i had come in the period just after Harappa
 karyaalay ke baahar baithi mahila teacher ko baithe dekha to sochane laga ki wo na jane kitne varshon se isi tarah din ke dhalane yaa biit jane kaa intazaar kar rahi hai
 How many armaments must have been destroyed in such a college
 system ne inhen kitna tod diya hoga
 Regarding this college, built in 1985, the principal said that three years ago ECL came to extract coal here
 vaada tha ki college ko duusari jagah shift kar diya jayega
 The college has not shifted yet
 college ke liye isiel ne jagah de di he
 Tender has come out but the work has not started
 tab tak kya in bacchon ko kiraaye kii imaarat main kisi surakshit jagah par nahin bheja saktaa he
 The EACL went away, but after it left, the thieves kept extracting coal here and made a tunnel just below the college

 We are seeing this picture from metros to towns

 You leave chhot to jayega hi or chhodana bhi padegaa lekin aap darshakon main se saikadon aisi jaankariyaan aa chuki hai jin par kaam karne ke liye lanbaa samay chahie
 Nowadays, no one knows how long the anchor is, where we will tell the future of your children, where they are being ruined

 chaatr bhi chup hai
 That is why this series is important why we are silent

 When our colleague Santosh went here, many departments were closed due to examination
 ham bheetar se haal nahin dekh sake
 The principal said that in English, Botany, Geography and Santhali, teachers are indigo
 sochie adivasee chaatro ke liye college he or vahaan unheen kii bhashaa ke teacher nahin hai
 Such a scam can only happen in our country
 yahaan ke chaatro ne bhi kai baar vot diya hoga, mujhe yakeen nahin hota ki vot dete vakt in logon ne kabhi apane college kaa khyaal kiya hoga
 Ashok Thakur ji does not have policy making in his hands

 It is not that the students do not speak but they do not have the right to speak

 Had there been a vote in the name of Vinoba Bhave, the leaders would have blown twenty three million on his birth anniversary

 Control is the important factor here
 lakhon chaatro ko sadi hui vyavastha mil rahi he, ve har jagah niyantran main hai
 Higher education in India has controlled millions of students by filling them in a warehouse named college
 unhen kisi laayak nahin choda he
 The principal said right that he may not be under the control of his father but is in control of his system
 is college main polytical science, sanskrit, ichonmiks, main ek ek professor hai
 While there are 300 to 400 children in each class

 Being on contract, what is happening with women lecturers, we should tell you the same thing from which state

 aapako pehle khai kii gaharaai nazar aegi
 The trench has formed behind the college digging coal
 college ke thik neeche kii zamin ke neeche bhi avaidh rup se koyala nikaala jaataa rahaa, surang banati rahi or ab yah college bhi dhah saktaa
 College has become baseless, man's Aadhaar number is being created, college has become baseless
 surang itani gahari he ki college ke neeche pani kaa str or gaharaai main chalaa gaya, lihaaza shauchalay main pani tak nahin he
 From the top, this college looks like you will fly to London with your baby and Baba in the car that i will not put my kids in this college, my God is so horribly, let's go to Delhi, and watch some English news channel
 Too Feel That India Is Doing Something Great
 ij dis a college, luk at cambridge, luk at harvard
 Its Hindi translation means that on seeing this college, to save your liver from being torn to pieces here, you will run away in Delhi in a car

 When i saw the female teacher sitting outside the office, she began to wonder how many years she had been waiting for the same day to pass or pass
 is tarah ke college main inke kitne armaan dhwast hue honge
 How much the system must have broken these
 1985 main bane is college ke bare main principal ne bataaya ki teen saal pehle isiel yahaan koyala nikaalane ai
 The promise was that the college would be shifted to another place

 You saw in the University Series that the problems are there even in the colleges of metros
 magar vahaan ke chaatro ke bolne main ek khaas tarah kii aakraamakata aa gai he
 There is apathy, but for a short time only the right sense is also awakened

 But think, change your priorities a little, you also listen to the false and long speeches of the leaders, believe them too but think a little about what is happening in the name of higher education

 If you go to the room of ministers, you will definitely get a white towel on the back of the chair, that towel is also on their car seat
 safed tauliya na mili to mantri banane kaa sukh nahin miltaa he
 There are two types of white towel
 ek bada vaala jo kursi par peeth se lekar seat tak bicha hota he or ek chota vaala jo brifces ke upar yaa kandhe par hota he
 Not a professor in class, but the white towel is everywhere

 It is alleged that the book of two crores is not getting the book, the employees were arbitrarily placed on the contract, now all these are normal allegations, then i do not understand why VC Pradeep Kumar Garg was removed

 Now there is no permanent, otherwise it is natural
 magar kanuunan ve aisa nahin kar sakate the

 BJP is preparing to get down with Mission 265 in UP assembly elections
 apane mishan 265 kii shuruyaat bijepi chaar parivartan yatraaon se karegi ye yatra agle maheene 5 navambar se shuru hogi
 These bjp's Parivartan Yatras will pass through all the 403 assembly seats in UP
 saharanpur sepperivartan yatraahogi shurubijepi adhyaksh amit shah pehali parivartan yatra kii shuruyaat paanch navambar se saharanpur se karenge
 The second change will be undertaken by Union Minister Uma Bharti from Lalitpur on 6 November
 teesri parivartan yatra jisaki shuruyaat kendriya mantri calraj mishra 7 navambar ko baliya se karengen
 The fourth Parivartan Yatra, which will be started by Home Minister Rajnath Singh on November 9 from Sonbhadra
 bijepi kii chaaron yatraaon kaa samaapan 25 disambar ko hoga
 On the conclusion of these visits, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will address a huge rally in Lucknow
 sutron kii maane to bijepi kii yojana he ki pradhanmantri ke har maheene upi ke adhik se adhik daure karen
 Earlier, PM Modi has already rallied in Saharanpur, Allahabad, Gorakhpur, Bareilly
 jatigat samikarnon ke hisaab se ranneetidusari taraf bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne jatigasamikarnonke hisaab se apni chunavi bisaat bichhaani shuru kar di he
 The BJP president has launched Swati Singh, wife of Dayashankar Singh, who made objectionable statements on Mayawati, to woo the Thakur vote bank by making her the president of the UP Mahila Morcha
 isse pehle brahman vot bank ke liye shivapratap shukla ko rajyasabha bheja gaya
 If the opinion of all castes is considered, then the BJP leadership will use the big leaders of all castes and all the society in the election campaign
 jaise mayawati ke dalit vot bank main send lagane ke liye bijepi ne buddha bhikshukon kii dhamm chetana yatra ko puure upi main nikalwai or jiskaa shanivaar ko samaapan amit shah kii maujuudagi main kanpur main hoga
 The Dhamma Chetna Yatra of the Buddha monks has prepared a Dalit vote for the BJP in up's 250 assembly seats
 sargical strike ko bhi oochhaalane kii taiyaariisi tarah bijepi is chunaav main bhartiya sena ke dwaara kiye gaye paak adhikrut kashmir main sargical strike kaa rajnatik phayda lene ke liye sargical strike ko raashtra suraksha or rashtrawaad se jodakar chunaav main jaayegi
 BJP will do its utmost to take advantage of Defense Minister Manhor Parrikar by honoring the entire UP like Agra and Lucknow by creating an atmosphere of surgical strike till the elections
 piem ne kiya chunavi aagaazdusari taraf dashahra ke din piem narendra modi ne jayshri ram kaa naaraa laga kar apane hindu vot bank pehle se bhi zyada majboot karne kii shuruyaat kar di he
 Till the assembly elections, such slogans would be heard hundreds of times from the mouths of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Amit Shah
 har booth ko lekar ban rahi ranneetibijapi ke sutron kii maane to chunaavon ke liye bijepi ne upi main 87% booth hai
 Before the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, BJP was at the booth of 37%
 sutron kaa ye bhi kahana hai ki sirf avadh main teenon partiyaan baraabar hai
 From Azamgarh to Ruhelkhand, BJP has only a fight with SP
 bispi puure upi main kahi bhi ladaai main nahin he is liye unke sabhi janaadhar vaale netaa ek ek kar mayawati kaa saath chhodkar ja rahe hai
 Despite all this, the party has not yet decided the face of the Chief Minister's post in UP
 sutron kaa ye bhi kahana he ki party samay rahete hue ek baar phir se sabhi pahaluon par vichaar karegi or mukhyamantri pad kaa ummidavaar tay karegi
 People from all over the world come to see the beauty of the world famous Taj Mahal
 lekin agra ke tajganj ke log parivahan se judi baari mushkilen jhel rahe hai
 In fact, the Supreme Court has banned petrol and diesel vehicles within 500 meters of the Taj Mahal
 yahaan tak ki ambulance bhi is aria main nahin aa sakate hai, jabatak ki wo bydaree se chalane vaale nahin hon, yaa phir uske paas permit nahin ho
 It is difficult and even more troublesome for the 10,000 residents of Nagla Paima village and the people of 6 nearby villages
 ye gaanv pratibandhit jone se baahar he or tajmahal se isaki duuri 700 meter he
 Therefore, petrol and diesel powered vehicles can be run here, many people have these vehicles but when it comes to going to the city, they have to take a 15 km long route to the city
 aisa isliye kyonki supreme court ke pratibandh kii vajah se in gadiyon ko is root se jane kii anumati nahin he
 Former Union Minister Dr
 Mahesh Sharma visited Taj Mahal several times in the last five years
 unhone yahaan ke logon ko ye samasya dur karne kaa aashvsaan bhi diya, lekin is koi samaadhaan abtak nahin niklaa he
 The entire Tajganj is being resettled under the Smart City Project, but a single road has not been built for this village so that these people can reach Agra city at the earliest if needed
 sthaneey nivasee shiv kumaar sharma ne india today se kaha, "in gaanvon main rahanaa jail main rahane ke jaisaa he, ek baar gaanv main ghusane ke baad aap kaid ho jate hai, kyonki gaanv se nikalne kaa ekmaatr rasta 15 kilometre lanbaa he jo dhandhupura se hokar jaataa he, yadi kisi ko jaldi main shahar janaa he to use 700 meter chalakar mukhya sadak tak janaa hoga, phir use 900 meter or chalanaa hoga
 After that he will reach Shilpgram from where he will be able to get public transport
 "shiv kumaar ne bataaya ki medical immergency kii haalat main yahaan ambulance nahin bulaai ja sakati he or marij ko cycle rickshaw yaa phir betry rickshaw ke jariye ambulance parking tak le janaa padataa he jo 1
 It is 5 kilometers away
 paryaton vikaas cameti ke chairman saiyad ibrahim jaidi ne kaha ki in gaanv waalon ke liye saal 2006 se hi raahat dene kii koshish kii ja rahi he, lekin ab koi pukhta kadam nahin uthaaya ja sakaa he
 According to the report, when the Taj Mahal is opened five days a month at night, the people of this village are imprisoned
 suraksha kaarnon kii vajah se inaki sari movement roak di jaati he
 An 18-year-old student of Kendriya Vidyalaya allegedly committed suicide by hanging himself in his room
 chaatr kaa naam aman bataaya gaya or aatmahatya kii vajah kaa ab tak khulaasa nahin ho paaya he
 Police said that the case of Aman's suicide came when his father Rajan returned home after doing duty
 vah biguef main sahaayak upanireekshak hai
 There was no response to Aman even after repeated calls
 mador police thana ke jaanch adhikari savai singh ne bataaya ki jab aman ke kamare kaa darwaja kholaa gaya to vahamrit payagaya
 He committed suicide by hanging from the fan
 input- bhashaa The seriousness of the situation after the terror attack in Uri, Kashmir on Sunday morning can be gauged from the fact that there was a round of meetings throughout the day to tighten Pakistan
 is mudde par pradhanmantri narendra modi ne apni aage kii ranneeti tay karte hue sena ko munhtod jawaab dene ko kaha he
 Not only this, he has also ordered to resume anti-terror operations halted in the valley

 Now, not just talks, and just Karyauri's terrorist attack has ended the restraint of the Modi government against the Pakistan government
 jaish e mohammadki is karatuut ke baad jis tarah kii pratikriya pakistan kii taraf se ai he, uske baad bharat ab sakht sandesh dene ke liye puraa man bana chukaa he
 PM Modi, who has taken many historical initiatives to improve relations with Pakistan, is no longer in the mood for even a little bit
 ek gambhir or zimmedaar mulk hone ke naate jatke main koi qadam to bharat nahin uthayega, lekin yah tay he ki is dafaa javaanon kii qurbaani jaaya nahin hone di jaaegi
 Round of meetings continues After the attack on the army base at Uri in Jammu and Kashmir, the round of meetings on the response strategy continues

 Head of SIT R
 ke
 Raghavan said today that the interrogation of Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi in the case of the riots in the Gulberg Society after Godhra is a big step towards revealing the secrets and understanding in this case and the SIT will report on April 30 or before the Supreme Court
 Will hand over to 59 varshiya modi se poochtacha ke bare main jaankaree dene se inkaar karte hue raghavan ne kaha ki kal do daur main mukhyamantri se poochtacha karne vaale sibiai ke purv diaiji e
 K
 malhotra ab raahat main dikhaai dete hai
 He said that he is confident in the ability of his officers
 raghavan ne kaha ki vah is baat se khush hai ki ucchtam nyaayalay dwaara niyukt vishesh jaanch dal ne mukhyamantri ko poochtacha ke liye bula liya
 He said, "this is a big step in trying to uncover and understand some mysteries in the case
" main khush hum ki hamane mukhyamantri se poochtacha kii
 Raghavan said that the petition of Zakia Jafri, widow of former Congress MP Ehsan Jafri, who was killed along with 68 others in the Gulberg Society riots, is a 'bible' of the SIT and questions were widely related to it
 esaiti pramukh ne kaha, ‘‘mujhe peediton kii bahut chintaa he or main nyaay se kabhi bhi apni najar nahin hataa sakaa
 Raghavan said that he and Malhotra had discussed the questions to be put before Modi but they have not yet discussed the answers
 unhone kaha, ‘‘vah :malhotra: tarotaaja or raahat main dikhaai dete hai
 Right now i have not spoken to him on the answers
 ’’ jab raghavan se poocha gaya ki unhone modi se poochtacha kyon nahin kii to unhone kaha ki vah gavaahon yaa aropiyon se nahin milte or yah jaanch adhikari kaa kaam he
 He said, "this is a good old tradition which the CBI follows
" nideshak kabhi sawaal nahin karata
 i adopted it here as well
 yah ek nishpaksh or swasth parampara he
 On the possibility of the SIT calling Modi again for questioning if needed, he said, "I have to see what evidence has been gathered
" mujhe dekhnaa he ki unhone malhotra ko kya bataaya
 Raghavan said in response to a question that he would not go into the details of the inquiry
 unhone kaha, ‘‘main jaanch adhikari ke adhikaron kaa sammaan karata hum
 i can't say do it and don't do it
 ’’ gulburg dangon se pare sawaal poochne ke maamle main unhone jaankaree dene se inkaar kiya
 When asked if 62 questions were asked to Modi, he said that this is a 'hypothetical figure'
 esaiti kii karrwai main deree or pakshpaat ke aaropon par raghavan ne kaha ki yah samajhnaa chahie ki unhone gujarat ke sabhi adhikariyon ko isse dur rakhaa
 "they (SIT officers) have done a good job," he said
 adaalat apana faisla degi
 On the question of submitting the SIT report before the Supreme Court, he said, "we will submit it on or before April 30
 ’’ kya mukhyamantri narendra modi ne poochtacha main puraa sahyog diya, is sawaal ke jawaab main raghavan ne kaha, ‘‘malhotra santusht dikhaai dete hai
 i think it was a satisfactory conversation between the Chief Minister and Malhotra
 ’’ kisi tarah ke raajnneetik dabaav ke prashn par raghavan kaa jawaab tha, ‘‘kya aapako main aisa vyakti dikhaai detaa hum jo dabaav main he
 i am relieved
 koi dabaav nahin rahaa
 i am doing my work
 ’’ jakia kii yachika par mukhyamantri ke saath poochtacha ke baad kisi tarah kii praathmiki darj kiye jane kii sambhaavna par unhone tippanee karne se inkaar kar diya

 ' a post shared by ektaveeres (@ektaravikapoor) on May 27, 2018 at 10:49pm PDT What would be more laziness and audacity for a columnist on political and current affairs to use his own writing anniversary to re-examine the same issue? Exactly 10 years ago today, in National Interest ("liberate Our Cities", August 6, 2005), a basic question was raised on our decaying cities whether these cities were lying loose because they were transformed into colonies of those huge states
 Have they been part of? Are the votes of our leaders in the hinterland of the vast states, so they gain their strength by winning elections there and then use it to rule big and thriving cities? To put it simply, do our leaders collect their votes from the villages and cash it in the cities, especially when these cities are state capitals? Is this the reason that Mumbai, Bengaluru, Kolkata and Chennai have been rotting continuously while Delhi has improved a lot compared to them? Or that Chandigarh has largely protected itself, where the government has more presence than any other part of the country due to its small size? Is the reason behind this that there is more vote power in the villages while there is relatively more money in the cities? The solution, if not nonsense, may seem idealistic: big cities should be freed from colonial status

 kam se kam rajyon kii rajdhaniyon ko vahaan se hataa diya jaae, jaisaa america ne kiya he (neuyork kii rajdhani albani he, california kii secramento he, ilinois kii springfield he, jiske chalate neuyork shahar, los angelis, san francisco, chicago ityadi mukt hai)
 If this happens then our cities will be run by local bodies instead of powerful mayors, as in America or China
 ferj karen ki maharashtra kii rajdhani sangli yaa akola ban jaati he, pashchim bengal kii purulia, andhra kii guntur (jo ki ab duusari vajahon se hoti dikh rahaa he), karnataka kii hubli, tab aisa hi hoga
 An additional advantage for India will be that the move will provide a reason for the creation of new cities
 iske alaava in nai rajdhaniyon main sampatti ke bazaar main aayaa oochaal netaaon ke liye bhi paisa banane kaa aakarshan paidaa karegaa
 Things have changed very rapidly in the last decade
 hamaare tamaam shahar or zyada khastahal hue hai
 Mumbai and Chennai have declined faster than ever before
 sach kahen to kaaphi lambey samay se kolkata main koi giravat nahin ai he
 i think, the idea of playing melodious music on the traffic lights there is very good, if not great, to cool the minds of the drivers stuck in traffic
 pichley hakrate meri twitor timeline par sarvaadhik lokapriy twiton main se ek bhartiya rail seva ke ek mumbai sthit adhikari anant rupangudi kaa tha jisane detective byomakesh bakchashi dekhne ke baad likhaa tha ki chalis ke dashak kii prishthbhumi par banaai gai yah film itani yathartwaadee isliye lagati he kyonki us daur kaa kolkata dikhaane ke liye dibaakar banerjee ko bahut mehnat nahin kerani padi hogi, vaise bhi saath saal main bahut kuch yahaan nahin badla he
 However, one thing that has changed in the case of many cities is their names
 aaj ham kolkata, bangaluru or chennai kehete hai
 Apart from this, in all our big cities including Chennai and Hyderabad, governments of other parties have also come up compared to a decade ago
 hamane shaharon main hue badlaav ke vishay ko jin ahm vajahon se dobaaraa uthaaya he, unamem uparyukt main se koi nahin he
 Firstly, Narendra Modi is the first Prime Minister who has talked about the benefits of urbanization without hesitation and has not shed tears on its inevitability, as the previous Prime Minister had done
 jon denwar ne jab ''wild montana skyse'' kaa marsia gaaya, (jisamen unhone kaha tha ki is shahar main kuch to aisa he jo saanson main ghul nahin paata, is desh main kuch aisa he ki ve ise chhod nahin pate) usase kaaphi pehle gandhi hamen bataa chuke the ki gaanv achche hai or shahar bure hai
 Gandhi's "india resides in the villages", ignoring Ambedkar's question that "should this last forever?" a decade ago when we were talking about liberating cities
 The most talked about President at the time was A
 pi
 J
 abdul kalam kaa pyoraa (piyuare) naamak mantra tha jiskaa matlab tha gramin ilaakon main shahari suvidhaayen muhaiyaa karana
 The UPA policies were hostile to cities and the middle class living there
 is dauraan agar shaharon kaa vikaas hua, to vah sthaneey siyasat or builder mafia kii tarkeebon tathaa gathjod kaa parinaam rahaa
 Today, after Ambedkar, Modi is the first leader who counts urbanization as a boon
 ve apane siyaasi ateet main ahmedabad-gandhinagar ke aadhunikeekaran ke sunahari uplabdhi ginavaate hai jahaan aaj ve vaishvik vittiya centre viksit kar rahe hai
 The delimitation of our constituencies has also enabled cities to reap political benefits
 shaharon main aaj ek nae kism kii jaagrukta or shashaktikaran kaa bodh dekha ja rahaa he
 It should not be surprising that the new political movement that emerged for the first time after decades was a purely urban phenomenon, the result of which we see as the Aam Aadmi Party government in Delhi
 aap kah sakate hai ki shahar aaj ek chalan ban chukaa he
 Today, sitting where i am writing this column, it is an attempt to see the latest developments in Mumbai in this light
 maharashtra ke nae mukhyamantri, jo lambey samay baad sabase yuva mukhyamantri hai or aadhunik bhi, unhone desh ke is sarvaadhik mahanagareey shahar main sabase pehle bif khaane par purna pratibandh laga diya
 In the sequel, he has issued a decree that multiplex cinemas must show at least one Marathi film at their prime time
 pehle kadam ke peeche mumbai ke hindookaran kaa vichaar he or duusare kadam ke peeche uske marathikaran kaa, lihaaja donon hi faisle mumbai kii antarnihit takat kii buniyaad par chot karte hai, yah takat uski mahanagariyata he
 In the coming days, some more decisions are expected along the same lines
 bijepi or shivasena kaa samaan vot bank hindu or marathi he jise lekar unamem hode machi he
 Although the sociology of politics in India would have been so flat, life would not have been so fun for us journalists
 masalan, aap shivasena main nai peedi ke netritv ko hi dekhen jiskaa najariya shahar ko lekar bilkul alahada he
 Uddhav Thackeray's son Aditya is still out of college, but after a long time he has introduced the most modern idea for the city to make Mumbai nights more bright

 Last week, he told me to take a tour of the academy that the bowling machines and high-speed training cameras present in it are of equal status to Australia's cricket academy

 Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra targeted the Narendra Modi government on Friday for the news related to the crisis surrounding the auto sector and said that the government's silence on it is the most dangerous
 unhone twit kar kaha, ''auto sector ke 10 lakh logon kii naukari par khatra he

" yahan kaam kar rahe logon ko apni roji-roti ke nae thikaane dhundne padenge
 The most dangerous is the silence of the BJP government over the eroding employment, weakening trade and the economy's back-breaking policies

 ! bhartiya janata party ke mukhyalay main shuukravaar 15 farvari ko tisare tal par mahasachivon ke liye bane 7 kamaron main se 6 band pade the
 Only one room, which belongs to Kailash Vijayvargiya, was open
 vahaan kisi kaaryakarta yaa duusare logon kii awajahi roki gai thi kyonki dopaher main apane kamare main baithe kailash sabhi bhaajapa shasit rajyon ke mukhyamantriyon ko phone ke jariye rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah kaa nirdesh suna kar uskaa aksharshah paalan sunishchit karne ko kah rahe the
 The instruction was that the CM or the state government minister must be present at the funeral of the CRPF jawans who were martyred in the Pulwama attack
 vijayawargeey ko jab bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah ne mukhyamantriyon ko party kaa nirdesh sunaane ko kaha (takreeban dopaher 2 baje) usase pehle unhen (amit shah ko) vibhinn rajyon se yah soochna mil chuki thi ki siarpief javaanon par aatanki hamale ke khilaaf swatahsfoort bheed ekatra ho rahi he
 Seeing the spontaneous movement of people in various states including Delhi, the BJP Yuva Morcha and Mahila Morcha were asked to lead this crowd but with caution that do not lead the crowd by taking the BJP banner poster and where needed Just be a part of the crowd and raise their voice
 sadhe hue or saavdhaan andaaj main bhaajapa kii yah kavayad kyon or kisalie thi? party ke ek varisht netaa do-took kehete hai, ''yah janabhaavana hi 2019 ke janadesh kaa agenda he
 An agenda which has not been set by any party or individual but by the country
 " janabhaavana ko dekhte hue hi bhaajapa kaaryakartaaon ne 17 farvari ko desh ke sabhi jila kendron par shradhanjali sabha yojit kar shaheedon ko naman kiya
 The party president had given clear instructions that these programs should not be held in a closed room or hall but should be held in an open and public place
 aisa isliye taaki shradhanjali sabha sirf bhaajapa se jude hone kii jagah aam logon se judi lage
 BJP strategists are assuming that the Pulwama incident occurred at a time when the BJP needed an effective issue for 2019
 2014 main swayan narendra modi janadesh kaa agenda ban gaye the
 Making him the head of the campaign committee for the 2014 Lok Sabha elections in the bjp's national executive in Goa in June 2013 became a compulsion for the BJP, as modi-modi slogans started in every BJP program before the executive
 Were
 logon or kaaryakartaaon kii bhaawanaaon ko dekhte hue modi ko sitambar, 2013 main pradhanmantri kaa pratyaashee ghoshit kar diya gaya
 The BJP also benefited from this and for the first time the party secured more than a majority of seats (282)
 1984 ke baad, arthath 30 saal ke baad kisi bhi dal ko purna bahumat kyon mila? party ke ek mahasachiv kehete hai ki, ''aisa isliye sambhav ho sakaa kyonki 2014 main janabhaavana modi ko pradhanmantri banane kii thi
 "before the Pulwama incident, there was nothing like united public sentiment in the electoral atmosphere for 2019 which was being created
 sabhi siyaasi dal chunavi charchaa ko apane rukh ke hisaab se modeye kii koshish main lage the
 Congress and other opposition parties were raising issues like the misuse of Rafael, CBI and other investigative agencies, plight of farmers and BJP was taking a defensive stand on these issues
 saath hi is koshish main lagi thi ki 2019 kaa chunaav modi kii netritv kshamta ke mudde par lade
 Apart from this, the BJP was engaged in saving its fort through political weapons like Ram Mandir, Triple Divorce and Reservation
 modi ko lekar 2014 jaisaa maahaul nahin he, iskaa sanket vibhinn survey ke nateezon se bhi nikal rahaa tha
 The BJP was understanding this fact
 lekin pulavama ne in saare samikarnon or muddon ko peeche chhod diya he
 BJP national spokesperson and Rajya Sabha MP GVL Narasimha Rao says that it is now clear that the issue of public opinion for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections has now become an end to terrorism and everyone is with PM Narendra Modi
 janabhaavana ke is nerrative ko samajhate hue khud bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah, piem ke vikaas kaaryon kaa zikr karne kii jagah modi ko aatankwaad ko munhtod jawaab dene vaale netaa ke rup main charchaa ke centrebindu main laane kii koshish main lag gaye hai
 At the Saboti Stadium in Lakhimpur, Assam, on February 17, Amit Shah said at the party's youth flow Vijay Lakshya program, "the sacrifice of our brave martyrs will not go in vain as this time there is a BJP government led by Narendra Modi at the Center
" modi sarkaar kii sabase badi praathamikta raashtra kii suraksha he or is mudde par koi samjhauta nahin kiya ja saktaa
 "shah's statement comes at a time when the nation's security discussion is at the top of the priority list of the nation
 aasaan nahin he rahpulawama ghatana ke baad janamanas kii bhaawanaaon par khara utarane kaa avasar modi sarkaar ke paas he
 But in the current situation it looks more of a challenge than an opportunity
 bhaajapa ke netaa bhi maan rahe hai ki kootnithik tareekon yaa gupt sargical strike jaise vikalp yaa phir kashmiri aatankwaadiyon ko maar giraanaa jaise upayon se kaam chalane vaala nahin he
 As long as people do not see directly that India has taken more action against the Pakistani jawans and terrorists than what the terrorists had done on the soldiers in Pulwama, then public sentiments cannot be met
 lekin maujuuda halaat main aanan-fanan main is tarah kii kaarywai ke vikalp talashna asambhav nahin to kathin jarur he
 This is the biggest challenge
 bhaajapa netaa paroksh baatcheet main yah maan rahe hai ki pulavama kaa badla lene main jitani der hogi, janamanas main sarkaar ke khilaaf gussa panapana shuru ho jayega
 The opposition is also waiting for the occasion when there is a delay or sporadic action from the government so that it can come forward to create an atmosphere against the government
 isaki shuruyaat ho chuki he
 Randeep Singh Surjewala, the head of the Congress's media department, says, "modi (modi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman) gives a grand welcome by following protocol, who gave $ 20 billion gift to Pakistan in the face of terrorism and Pakistan's anti-terrorist attitude
" Praised
 "surajevaala yaheen nahin rukate, ve kehete hai, ''desh kii janata dekh rahi he ki pradhanmantri us shaks ko gale laga rahe hai jo pakistan ke samarthan main he
 Will Modi show courage to demand the withdrawal of a joint statement from Saudi Arabia with Pakistan, which negates the tenacity to declare Masood Azhar an international terrorist
 "congress ke netaaon kaa kahana he ki koi bhi rajnatik party is baat kii andekhi nahin kar sakati ki hamaare piem us shaks ke saath gale mil rahe hai jo masood ajahar ko antarrashtriya aatankwaadi ghoshit karne ke prayaason kaa virodh kar rahaa ho
 Overall, after the Pulwama attack, the wave of public sentiment that the BJP and the Modi government has started, if the party is successful in bringing it to shore, then the mandate will be with the Modi government, otherwise this wave will prove to be a vortex for the government and the BJP
 It is possible that the opposition is also waiting

 cigarette or paan masala jaise hanikaarak chizon kaa seven karne waalon ke liye ek buree khabar he
 In Uttar Pradesh, the price of cigarettes, cigars, pan masala and other tobacco products will now be expensive
 pradesh sarkaar in par waite 25 se 40 fisadi tak badhaane ja rahi he
 The proposal can be approved in a cabinet meeting to be held on Wednesday under the chairmanship of Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav
 isse jahaan rajya sarkaar kaa salanaa 200 karod rupee kaa rajasav badhegaa
 At the same time, those who are intoxicated by cigarette and pan masala will have to loose their pockets more
 is sambandh main vaanijya kar ayukta kii taraf se prastaav diya gaya he ki in utpaadon par waite kii dar 40 fisadi kar deni chahie
 Currently, cigarettes are taxed at the rate of 25 percent while goods manufactured from plain pan masala, khaini, zarda, surti and tobacco are taxed at the rate of 30 percent
 ek cigarette ab nahin milegi , puraa packet khareednaa hogacabinet baithak main buudhvaar ko yah bhi faisla bhi liya ja saktaa he jiske tahat dukandaar ab packet khol kar cigarette nahin bech sakenge
 The reasoning behind this is that the damage caused by open cigarette bed is not known

 'CBI Special Director Rakesh Asthana came to Kolkata on 18 June and ordered the authorities to file the final chargesheet on the Saradha, Narada and Rose Valley chit fund scams within the next three months

 There is less than a year left in the Lok Sabha elections
 aise main adhikariyon ko chusti dikhaane kii asthana kii taakid se yah baat bhi uthne lagi he ki kya sibiai par mamata banerjee or unki sarkaar ko pareshaan karne kaa koi rajnatik dabaav he
 TMC spokesperson Partha Chatterjee says, "this is nothing but revenge
" hamaari party pramukh ne notebandi, jiesti, aadhaar or anya muddon par centre kii bhaajapa sarkaar ko aade haathon liya he
 In this same rage, they are trying to throw mud on the Mamta government
 ’’pichley kuch varshon main in teenon maamalon main sibiai or pravartan nideshaalay (idi) kii ore se tiemasi ke kaddavar netaaon madan mitra or sudeep bandhopadhyaay ko girakrataar karne, 10 anya tiemasi netaaon ko saman bhejne or chah supplementry chargeshit daakhil karne ke alaava koi khaas pragati nahin dekhne ko mili
 Only the chit fund company chairman Sudipta Sen and his associate and accused Devyani Mukhopadhyay have been sent to jail in the Saradha scam
 roj vaili maamle main to keval group ke nideshak gautam kundu kii hi giraftaar hui he
 In the Narada scam, 13 firs filed by CBI and ED have names of three sitting state ministers and five TMC mps, but no arrests have been made so far
 kendriya agenciyon kii in maamalon main aakhri baar agast 2017 main sakriyata dikhi thi, jab kolkata ke meyar sowan chatarji or saansad sugto roy ko poochtacha ke liye bulaayaa gaya tha
 The CBI moved the Supreme Court last year, accusing the state's CID and Special Investigation Team (SIT) of not getting any cooperation
 sibiai ne kaha tha ki rajya police maamle se judi filein dene se inkaar kar rahi he or sibiai ke adhikariyon se jhuthe maamalon main poochtacha kii ja rahi he
 In December 2017, the Supreme Court ordered that the West Bengal Police cannot interrogate any CBI officer
 pichley saal siidi ne bhaajapa netaaon par bhi karrwai kii thi
 It summoned BJP general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya and party leader Rupa Ganguly for questioning in a case related to child trafficking in North Bengal
 bhaajapa netaa or bashirhaat ke purv vidhayak shamik bhattacharya se pradhanmantri awaas yojana main kathith her-pher ke silsile main poochtacha kii gai thi
 The allegations were leveled during july-august when the ED was questioning TMC leaders in the Narada scam
 phir, teenon maamalon kii jaanch se jude idi or sibiai ke kai adhikariyon ke rajya se baahar tabadale ke anurodh ke kaaran jaanch adhikariyon kii kami ho gai thi
 And suddenly there was silence in these cases
 sibiai adhikariyon ne aarope lagaaya tha ki police unhen bevajaah pareshaan kar rahi he
 At the same time, ED officials said that during this time they were busy searching for evidence related to the case, so there was no movement from their side
 idi ke ek adhikari kehete hai, ‘‘naarad ghotaale main kam se kam teen tiemasi netaaon ke jawaab se ham santusht hai par zyaadaatar log taalamatol kaa ravaiya hi apana rahe hai
 Following the Supreme Court's directions in 2014, the CBI took over the investigation into the Saradha scam
 roj vaili or naarad ghotaale se jude maamle bhi adaalat ke aadesh ke baad sibiai ko saunpe gaye the
 "if the names of some TMC leaders appear in the final charge sheet and the hearing starts, some candidates' candidacy may be questioned," says a CBI official
