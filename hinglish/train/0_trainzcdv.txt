 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has extended the condition to resume the dialogue by canceling the Foreign Secretary level talks with Pakistan on the issue of the extremist organization Hurriyat
 sidhaa-sa matlab he ki vaarta prakriya tabhi shuru hogi jab pakistan bharat main algaavvaadiyon se baatcheet band karegaa
 This task will be difficult for Pakistan struggling with political dissatisfaction
 khaskar pradhanmantri navaj sharif sankat main hai
 He is facing a lot of opposition for extending his hand towards peace towards India
 isamen modi ke shapath grahan ke liye bharat yatra ke dauraan unka samjhautavaadi rukh bhi shaamil he
 If Sharif's political ground is shrinking, then Modi has limited options
 hurriyat ke maamle main rukh tay karne ke baad ab sarkaar ke saamne ek hi vishwasaneey upaay he ki donon deshon ke bich satta sameekaran ko puri tarah badal diya jaae
 Such a change should be brought which would force Pakistan to accept the primacy of India
 iske liye bharat ko furti se do morchon par pahal kerani hogi
 Large forces will have to be taken along and woo other countries in the neighborhood
 vyaavhaarik drushti se bharat ko japan, china or america ke saath baat kerani hogi jo agle maheene honi he
 The outcome of this conversation may indicate a fundamental strategic change
 japan ke saath parmaanu or raksha samjhaute ho sakate hai, china ke saath aarthik sahyog kii disha badal sakati he or america ke saath sambandhon main josh jagaane ke liye kuch diler kadam uthaae ja sakate hai
 a big strategic message in the neighborhood, especially in Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka, will be to pacify anti-india sentiments
 yahaan kuch gunjaaish he
 Modi has made a good start in Nepal, has also indicated a desire to rework the 1950 treaty, but it has to be taken forward
 jamini seemaa samjhaute par bijepi ke bheetar virodh shant kar or ise sansad se manjuuri dilaakar ve bangladesh main mizaaj main badlaav laa sakate hai
 Similarly, a new beginning can be made by focusing economic dialogue with Sri Lanka on issues such as tourism and infrastructure
 is sabamein kamyaabi ke baad modi sarkaar kshetra main pradhanta or vishwa manch par bulandi kaa majboot ranneetik sandesh de sakati he jisase pakistan ke saath vyavhaar main vajan jarur badhegaa
 On the contrary, the deadlock with Pakistan will raise the ears of big forces, especially the US and China, who are important allies of Pakistan
 ek or samasya yah he ki pakistan ke bheetar asthirataa, takaraav or asuraksha kaa maahaul he isliye uske saath vyavhaar or jatil ho gaya he
 For this reason, India always has to find a way to come down after canceling the negotiations every time, because the opposite effect of breaking contacts is more
 jo bhi ho, modi ke saamne chunauti saaf he
 They will have to take strategic advantage from this decision or else it can give backlash

 What is the role of independents: In the tussle for CM post in Maharashtra, BJP and Shiv Sena are busy fixing their equation through independent mlas
 abhi tak 6 nirdaleey vidhayak donon dalon ke samarthan kii baat kah chuke hai
 Out of these, 3 independent mlas have declared support for BJP and 3 for Shiv Sena

 However, BJP has not announced the names of the councilors supporting them

 ) Kriti Sanon recently appeared in a special appearance in the film Kalank
 ve is film ke gane 'aira gairaa' main parform karti najar ain thi
 Kriti, who has performed special songs in many films, has trouble with the item number tag and according to Kriti it is a bit insulting to the actresses
 unhone ye bhi kaha ki jab aise hi gaanon par salmaan khan or shahrukh khan jaise sitare parform karte hai to unke gaanon ko item number nahin kaha jaataa haiunhone hindustan times ke saath khaas baatcheet main kaha ki in song ko log item number kyon kehete hai, mujhe samaj nahin aata
 It does not give good vibes
 ye sirf dance numbers hai jo film ke antertanment factor ke chalate filmon main hota he or in songs ko audiyans pasand karti he
 So why not adopt a slightly better approach towards these songs and also show positive attitude towards the people who are making these songs
 jab aamir sar, shahrukh sar or salmaan sar filmon main special parformens dete hai to unhen item number nahin kaha jaataa he
 Then why is this so in the case of girls? Such a mindset needs a change

 So be it any dance number, they are all close to my heart
 isliye mujhe ye item song kaa tag thodaa bura lagata he
 i would also like to work in a dance film in future

 loksabhaa adhyaksh chune jane kii ummid main baithe bhaajapa ke varisht netaaon ko pradhanmantri narendra modi chaunkaa sakate hai
 The manner in which he has given the mantra of maximum focus on quality, dexterity and readiness to the mps in the BJP Parliamentary Party meeting is clear that seniority alone is not the sole criterion for delegating responsibility
 aise main apni varishthata ke aadhaar par khud ko loksabhaa adhyaksh banane ke yogya maan rahe bhaajapa netaaon niraashaa haath lag sakati he
 The new Speaker of the Lok Sabha is to be elected by 19th date

 lekin kai aise netaa hai jo varishthata ke aadhaar par bhale yogyata nahin rakhte hon lekin sansadeey niyamon, kaayadon, paramparaon kii unhen acchhee jaankaree he
 There are some leaders who have been elected to the Lok Sabha for the first or second time but have been the first in the Rajya Sabha
 bhaajapa sutron kaa kahana he ki darasal, pradhanmantri narendra modi or grahamantri tathaa bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah kisi aise vyakti ko loksabhaa adhyaksh banane main ruchi rakhenge jo sadan kii kaarywahi thik prakaar se sanchalit kar sake
 The personality of the Speaker should be such that there is no doubt about its impartiality and which all the people of the party respect
 modi or shah kii pehali koshish yah hogi ki sadan main zyada se zyada kaam ho sake or kam se kam vyavdhaan sadan main ho
 In such a situation, Modi can probably trust a person who meets these criteria

 Which lasted till noon

 While intensifying the attack on Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar, Leader of Opposition in Maharashtra Assembly Eknath Khadse on Friday alleged that 326 acres of land in Pune were illegally given to a trust and on some part of the land which Pawar's daughter and son-in-law have a stake in the technology park to be built
 bhartiya janata party :bhaajapa: ke varisht netaa khadse ne vidhansabha ko bataaya ki varsh 1989 main pune ke jiladhikari shrinivas patil ne yarvada main mukund bhawan nyaas ko jameen dilaane main madad kii
 Patil later became the NCP MP
 unhone daawa kiya, pavaar kii beti supriya sule or unke pati sadanand sule kaa ukt bhoomi ke hisse par banaae ja rahe panchasheel tech park main 909-909 share hai
 In addition, Balwa's company is building a luxury hotel on the side of that land

 unhone kaha ki puraa jameen ghotaalaa kareeb 15000 karod rupe kaa he or yah sab raajnneetik sangrakshan ke kaaran hua

 com / jwkgm5xjio Disputes are being raised over the terms of reference of the 15th Finance Commission
 pehle vitt mantri ne vivaad ko bebuniyaad bataaya or ab khud pradhanmantri karyaalay ne twit kaa sahaara lete hue vitt ayog par lag rahe aaropon ko galat qaraar diya gaya he
 Through this tweet, the Prime Minister has assured that there is no flaw in the terms of reference of the Finance Commission nor will there be any loss in central revenue allocation to any particular state or region
 pradhanmantri ne yahaan tak daawa kiya ki nae vitt ayog se kaha gaya he ki un rajyon ko rajasav main variyata di jaae, jinhone badhati jansankhya par lagaam lagane main safalataa pai he
 Its direct benefit will go to states like Tamil Nadu, which have gained significant advantage in controlling the population
 vitt ayog yun karata he rajyon main rajasav kaa aavantankendra sarkaar apane rajasav kaa ek bada hissaa rajyon main baantta he, jisase jin rajyon ke paas nunatam jivan str banane ke liye paryaapt sansaadhan nahin he vah kendriya rajasav se yah kaam kar sake
 Hence, to distribute this revenue of the Central Government, the Central Government constitutes the Finance Commission every 5th year
 vitt ayog is bantwaare ke liye rajyon kii jarurat kaa aankalan karti he or sateek aankalan ke liye vah kai kasautiyon kaa istemaal karti he
 Among these, the state's population and the state's earnings are two important criteria
 jahaan jansankhya se rajya kii jarurat nirdhaarit kii jaati he vahiin rajya kii jidipi se rajya main garibi kaa aankalan kiya jaataa he
 On the basis of these two criteria, an effort is made to give more resources to the states with more poverty and more population so that it can reach the state education, health and other services to its citizens
 ise padhein: andhra pradesh ko special states nahin special package diya jayega: jetalikya he vivaad?gauratlab he ki chaudaaven vitt ayog ke terms of reference main jansankhya ke aankadon ko istemaal karne kaa koi nirdesh nahin diya gaya tha
 Despite this, the 14 Commission used the 2011 Census data to accurately assess the needs of the states and compared it to the 1971 Census data
 aise main jo nateeja mila uske aadhaar par 14 ayog ne 2011 kii jansankhya ko 10 fisadi kaa vettege dete hue rajyon ko kendriya rajasav kaa 42 fisadi dhan aavantit karne kaa kaam kiya
 This was the highest revenue allocated to the states in the past
 ab 15wein vitt ayog ke terms of reference main kendra sarkaar ne nayaa nirdesh diya he ki rajyon ko rajasav kaa aavanton karne ke liye aise rajyon kaa bhi sangyaan liya jaae jinhone jansankhya par lagaam lagane main acchhee pahal kii he
 The government has directed such states to allocate more for this work so that other states can also be encouraged to curb the population
 ab 15 ayog ko die gaye nirdesh par aapatti uthaate hue purv vitt mantri pi chindmabaram ne daawa kiya ki maujuuda kendra sarkaar ne nae vitt ayog se 1971 ke janaganana aankadon kaa istemaal nahin karne kaa nirdesh diya he
 Due to this, Chidambaram argues that the states of the south will get less money from the central revenue, while he has done a good job continuously in keeping the population under control
 haalanki vitt mantri arun jetali ne apane blog par safai di he ki 15wein vitt ayog ke terms of reference main naveenatam jansankhya se jaahir hoti ‘jaruraton’ tathaa ‘jansankhya par kaabo karne kii disha main hui pragati’ ke bich thik-thik santulan baithaaya gaya he
 There is no prejudice or direction in the terms of reference of the 15th Finance Commission which can be said to have discriminated against states that have made better progress in terms of controlling population growth

 17wein minute main bharat ne banaai badhatmatch kaa pehla gol bharat ke mandeep ne kiya
 In the 17th minute of the match, Mandeep put SV Sunil's pass into the goalpost to put India ahead by one goal
 mejabaanon ne barabari karne kii koshish kii, lekin bhartiya rakshapankti ne unhen kaamyaab nahin hone diya
 Meanwhile, the trouble of Britain increased further when India got a penalty stroke in the 34th minute
 harmanpreet ne is maukey ko gol main tabdeel kar bharat ko 2-0 se aage kar diya
 Sreejesh thwarted several attacks from Britain, who were trailing by two goals, got a penalty corner in the 35th minute, which Ashley Jackson converted into a goal and gave the team some relief
 iske baad britain kii team ne kai baar hamalaa kiya, lekinshrijeshor bhartiya rakshapankti ne unke armaan puure nahin hone die
 Local body elections are in the head in Punjab, but the Congress Party, which is troubled by factionalism, is unable to cash in on the resentment against the akali-bjp alliance

 The Aam Aadmi Party is happy with the Congress's failure to give strong opposition
 aam aadmi aadmi party ke mukhya pravaktaa yogendra yadav ke mutabik punjab main ek bahut bada avasar he, chunki vahaan raajnneetik shunya he, akaliyon kii dhakkeshahi se log tang hai, bijepi ko unka hissaa samajhate hai, congress waapas aakar use thik kar sakati he, kisi ko bharosa nahin he

 palam railway stesan se lagate kai vidhansabha kshetra hai
 It is a large populated area like Dwarka
 saath hi saikadon coloniyaan hai jahaan kai lakh logon kii aabaadi basati he
 Keeping in view their facilities, this demand has been made for many years, but nothing has changed so far
 sabase badi baat ye he ki chetak express rajasthan main hinduon ke sabase bade aasthaa ke centre khatu shyaam dham ko bhi jodatii he
 Devotees go to Rajasthan in large numbers to visit Khatu Shyam
 logon kii maang he ki agar palam stesan par chetak kaa stop ban jaae to lakhon musafiron ke saath badi taadaat main safar karne vaale shraddhaluon ko badi raahat milegi
 After not accepting the demand, after getting fed up, the Dainik Yatri Sangh has extended its request to America

 Soon after the arrest of the firm's former CEO Giuseppe Orsi in Italy, Defense Minister AK Antony prohibited the payment of funds to the firm as well as the supply of the remaining nine helicopters
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne swatantraaa diwas ke maukey par buudhvaar ko laal kile ke pracheer se kareeb 82 minute tak bhaashan diya
 This is likely to be his last speech from the Red Fort due to the general election expected before August next year
 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav se pehle apane is bhaashan main haalanki piem modi ne chunaav shabd kaa zikr tak nahin kiya, lekin spich ke aarambh main hi unhone pichde samaaj kii baat kar siyaasi sameekaran saadhane ke sanket de die

 This time, Parliament tried to protect the entitlements of backward and backward by giving constitutional status to the OBC Commission

 The voice of reservation from the OBC society continues to be raised from states like Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Madhya Pradesh
 modi sarkaar ke khilaaf bhi obisi samaaj ke logon ne aarakshan ke mudde par khulkar aawaaj uthaai he
 In such a situation, in the speech of about one and a half hours from Red Fort, PM Modi has also indicated about the electoral strategy for the first time OBC Commission has been given constitutional status
 bataa den ki sanvaidhanik darja milane ke baad ayog ko saamaajik or shaikshanik drushti se pichde virgon ke liye suraksha upaay se sambandhi maamalon kii jaanch or nigaraanee karne kaa adhikaar hoga

 Today is India's first match in the ICC Champions Trophy
 isse badi baat ye he ki bharat kaa pehla hi match pakistan ke khilaaf he
 When India and Pakistan clash in the field, the atmosphere heats up
 team ke samarthan main phans naye-naye karname karte hai
 Now cricket and Indian players are also feverish on the food dish

 court ne ye maamla sirf shivlinga kii suraksha ke liye suna or export cameti banaai
 These proposals were submitted by the temple management committee on the basis of the committee's report
 supreme court ne chetavanee di ki agar is maamle main media galat reporting karata he yaa pakshakaar media main galat bayani karata he to uske khilaaf kanoon ke mutabik sakht karrwai kii jaaegi
 Things are still fine in Jammu and Kashmir
 vahaan desh kaa koi bhi naagarik bina anumati ke ja saktaa he
 But no Indian citizen can enter Nagaland without obtaining an inner line permit
 keval sthaneey nivaasiyon ko hi berokatoke rajya main ghoomane kii chhot he
 This inner line permit is a kind of internal visa-like document
 yun to inner line permit rule pehle jammu-kashmir main bhi lagu tha, magar shyama prasad mukherjee ke andolan ke baad vahaan permit system khatm ho gaya
 But, this rule continues even today in Nagaland
 ab yah maamla rashtriya str par bahes kaa vishay banane laga he
 Recently, BJP leader Ashni Upadhyay reached the Supreme Court on this matter, while on July 23, two mps also raised the issue of inner line permit system in the Lok Sabha
 jis par sarkaar ne kaha he ki bhartiya nagarikon ko arunachal pradesh, mizoram or dimapur ko chhodkar nagaland main yatra ke liye inner line permit kii jarurat hoti he
 The proposal of the state government to implement the inner line permit for Dimapur is currently under discussion
 aantarik vija jaisaa hota he inner line permitdesh main is vakt sirf nagaland main hi inner line permit system lagu he
 Under the Bengal Eastern Frontier Regulations, 1873, this arrangement allows for a limited period to enter a protected, restricted area
 naukari yaa phir paryaton ke liye pahunchane waalon ko anumati leni jaruri he
 It is said that during the period of slavery, the British government introduced the Inner Line Permit System
 tab nagaland kshetra main jadi-bootiyon or prakritik aushadhiyon kaa prachur bhandar tha
 Which was sent to Britain
 aushadhiyon par dusron kii najar na pade, iske liye british shashan ne nagaland ke hisse main inner line permit kii shuruyaat kii thi
 So that this area does not have contact with the outside areas
 aazaadee ke baad bhi sarkaar ne inner line permit ko jari rakhaa
 The reasoning behind this was that the living style of Naga tribals is different from art culture, colloquial others
 aise main inke sangrakshan ke liye inner line permit jaruri he
 So that outsiders cannot stay here and influence their culture
 mul adhikaar ke khilaaf he ilpsuprima court main ialpi ke khilaaf yachika daayar karne vaale ashnini upaadhyaay kehete hai ki ialpi vyavastha apane hi desh main vija lene kii tarah he
 It is a violation of the fundamental rights of Articles 14 (equality), 15 (prohibition of discrimination), 19 (freedom) and 21 (life) given to Indian citizens by the Constitution
 upaadhyaay ne kaha ki nagaland main 90 pratishat aabaadi isai ho chuki he
 Inner line permits were arranged for the protection of Naga tribals
 magar ab jab 90 pratishat aabaadi vahaan kii isai ho chuki he, sarkaar kii aadhikarik bhashaa angreji ho chuki he
 There is a church in every village
 adivasee apane puraane reeti-rivaajon kii jagah charchon main isai reeti-rivaaj se shaadiyaan kar rahe hai
 In such a situation, there is no justification for the Inner Line Permit implemented for the purpose of protection of Nagas
 ashnini upaadhyaay kaa aarope he ki nagaland ke sthaneey netaa algaavvaad kii dukaan chalaane ke liye chaahate hai ki sthaneey janata kaa baahar ke logon se sampark na ho sake
 Efforts are on to cut Nagaland from the world through Inner Line Permit
 ab maidani kshetra dimapur main bhi rajya sarkaar permit system lagu karnaa chaahati he
 On July 2, the Supreme Court dismissed Upadhyay's plea saying that he did not want to hear the issue at present
 nagaland ke bare main khaas baaten-nagaland kaa zyaadaatar hissaa pahari he
 Only Dimapur is the plain area, where railways and airlines are available
 pehle dimapur assam ke hisse main aata tha
 But to connect Nagaland with the country's transport, it was given to the plains area Dimapur
 kolkata se dimapur ko jodne ke liye saptaah main teen din indian airlines kii udaan he

 For example, on December 1, 1963, Nagaland became the 16th state of the Indian Union
 -nagaland purv main myanmar, uttar main arunachal pradesh, pashchim main assam or dakshin main manipur se ghira hua he
 Nagaland state has an area of 16,579 square kilometers and a population of 19,88,636 as per 2001 census
 -assam ghati kii seemaa se jude ilaake ke alaava is rajya kaa adhikansh kshetra pahari he

 "section 356 of the Constitution is enacted when the President is satisfied that a state cannot be ruled in accordance with the Constitution and it is sufficient grounds to believe"

 If the President's satisfaction is sufficient basis to believe, then according to this, all the President's rule of the past should be believed and declared as constitutional
 kya vitt mantri sabhi raashtrapati shashan ke cese main raashtrapati par itnaa vishwaas karne ke liye taiyaar hai
 His opinion is today or always has been
 raashtrapati shashan ko lekar kya yah nayaa sanvaidhanik or rajnatik paimaana he? to phir supreme court ne es aar bommai cese main jo paimaane tay kiye hai usamen kya is paimaane ko antim mana gaya he ki mahamahim ji santusht ho jaaen to iskaa matlab he ki sabakuch thik he
 There is documentary evidence that 35 members had demanded a split before and at the time of the assembly, but despite this the appropriation bill is claimed to have passed without voting
 is baat ke paryaapt sakshya hai ki viniyog vidheyak vastav main mat vibhaajan main gir gaya tha
 It is to be noted that till date (28 March 2016) neither the Chief Minister nor the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly has sent a certified copy of the Appropriation Bill to the Governor
 isliye yah swaabhaavik he ki viniyog vidheyak ko rajyapal kii manzuri nahin mili
 In this way, the alleged discussion on the Appropriation Bill and all the facts related to its passage clearly point towards its passage
 viniyog vidheyak ke bare main gambhir ashanka he
 As on date, there is no appropriation bill certified by the Speaker and approved by the Governor
 vitt mantri ke blog se hamane ye chand panktiyaan uthaakar ek jagah rakh di hai jo viniyog vidheyak ke paas hone yaa na hone se sambandhit hai
 The Finance Minister is not making it clear whether the vote was split or not
 agar hua tha to kiski anumati se hua tha
 The speaker is saying this that the division of votes was not allowed
 jab spikar anumati na de to kya sadsy khud se mat vibhaajan kara sakate hai yaa sadsy mat vibhaajan kii maang kar den to spikar kii anumati yaa asahmati kii koi zarurat hi nahin rah jaati
 Is there any such tradition or rule regarding the authority of the speaker? hamane mat-vibhaajan par spikar ke adhikaar jaanane ke liye em en kaul kii kitaab or shakdhar kii bahut hi moti si kitaab practice and procedure of parliament ko palat kar dekha
 Article is not our ability to interpret the law, yet the courage to get prescriptions in the work of older people is our own pleasure
 aap bhi koi nishkarsh nikaale bina in sawaalon kaa lutf uthaaiye kyonki ho saktaa he ki hamaare sawaal hi bachakaane hon
 However, on page 174 of this book it is written that the Speaker's privileges about not allowing division: “vaais vot (dhwani mat) par spikar ke faisle ko bina chunauti die sadsy chaahe to spikar ko apana naam ricard karne ke liye anurodh kar saktaa he
 The Speaker may accept the request if he feels that the matter is important and there is a general opinion in its favor in the House
 '' Nowhere does it seem that the speaker is bound while reading this paragraph
 wo chaahe to anurodh sweekaar kar saktaa he
 For example, many members of the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha opposed how the Aadhaar bill could be presented as a money bill
 magar sabko spikar kaa antim faisla sweekaar karnaa hi padaa
 Here also on page 174 it is written that the speaker can accept the request if there is a general opinion in its favor in the House
 sansad or vidhansabha ke spikar ke adhikaar main samanta hoti he
 The speakers are saying that they have passed by voice vote, the opponents are saying that they have passed with the vote and they are also saying that there was no voting
 main daawey ke saath nahin kah saktaa ki mat vibhaajan ko lekar antim baat kah di gai he yaa nahin
 May be we are lacking in understanding this matter! ab yahaan spikar kii bhoomika par sawaal khadey hote hai
 Even though they are not bound by the rule and cannot be challenged, did the speaker ignore the general opinion in the House
 aaropon or rajbhavan main kiye gaye daavon se to yahi lagata he ki spikar ne aam raay kii andekhi kii or mat vibhaajan ko sweekaar nahin kiya lekin aisa karne kaa unka adhikaar antim he yaa sadasyon kaa
 If the members are not accepted, will it be challenged in the court or in the Raj Bhavan? Is Raj Bhavan above the House? In this case, as much as the role of the speaker seems to be morally doubtful, the doubt is also on the Raj Bhavan
 jetali ji ne ek sawaal uthaaya he ki 28 march kar viniyog vidheyak kii pramanit prati rajbhavan ko nahin bheji gai
 Neither the Chief Minister nor the Speaker sent it, whereas it is the matter of March 18 only
 yahaan yah sawaal uthta he ki jetali ji ke anusaar agar viniyog vidheyak paas hi nahin hua to pramanit prati ke intazaar kaa kya auchity rah jaataa he? pramanit prati to spikar hi apane dastakhat se bhejtaa he to kya use sweekaar karne ke liye rajbhavan baadhya he? mukhyamantri kaa daawa he ki 18 taarikh ko nahin bheji gai magar uske agle din pramanit prati rajbhavan bhej di gai
 The Finance Minister is saying that the certified copy has not been sent till the 28th
 ab ise to tathyon ke dwaara hi sabit kiya ja saktaa he ki koun sahi bol rahaa he
 If the Chief Minister feels that a certified copy has been sent, then he should have presented evidence instead of blank statement
 saarvajanik taur par viniyog vidheyak se jude tathyon par spashtataa zaruri he kyonki isi ke paas hone yaa na hone ko lekar sanvaidhanik sankat kaa daawa kiya ja rahaa he
 Which also shows that 9 Congress mlas have gone with the BJP
 ab sawaal ye he ki viniyog vidheyak rakhte samay koi wheep jari hua tha
 If the whip is issued, can Congress members vote against it? Does not a case of change of party against these 9 mlas become a matter of breaking the whip
 kya bijepi or congress aisa hone par apane sadasyon ke kilaaf karrwai nahin karti hai
 Is it constitutionally correct for Congress mlas to violate the whip and go to BJP and embrace BJP? aap niyam tod kar kisi dal main chale jaayen to kya aap naitik or sanvaidhanik rup se sahi ho sakate hai? The speaker has canceled the membership of these 9 members
 ab unki kanoonee sthiti kya he yah spasht nahin he kyonki vidhansabha to nilambit ho chuki he
 These 9 members will go to the President or to the Governor or to the court to demand their rights
 inaki sadsyta ke faisle par abhi antim faisla baaki he
 If the court reinstates membership, it would be a big moral victory for the BJP even if these 9 members are from the Congress
 uttarakhand main harak singh ravat or assam main hemanth sharma jaise behad eemaandaar chhavi ke netaa bijepi ke paale main gaye to apni samanaantar mahatvakanksha kii khaatir lekin assam main bijepi ne apane saansad ko mukhyamantri kaa ummidavaar banaaya or uttarkhand main bhi kah diya siem unki party kaa hoga
 One should learn from BJP to respect its workers and also make good use of defectors
 bijepi kam se kam harak singh ravat jaise eemaandaar netaaon ke bare main soshal media main prachaar to karvaa hi sakati he ki aise eemaandaar netaaon se rahul gandhi ne milane se inkaar kar diya
 The politics of President's rule is the result of Congress governments
 congress ke gunaah bijepi ke liye vardaan sabit ho rahe hai
 As soon as you question the decision of imposing President's rule in Uttarakhand, some people will come to tell you Congress on social media
 iskaa matlab yah he ki jo gunaah congress ne kiye hai or vahi bijepi kare to uskaa zikr mat karo varna congressi ho jaaoge! ye sab chalata rahegaa
 Harish Rawat also has many questions to answer
 sting main ve bhi kaaphi eemaandaar dikh rahe hai!tippaniyan It is no less ridiculous to base the sting to sack the government
 wo bhi to ek khuleam sting he ki ek party duusari party se kanoon tod kar dal badal kar aae netaaon ko sahaara de rahi he
 There is definitely a moral and legal question about the sting
 sting ke aadhaar par ravat ko istipha dena chahie, congress ke kendriya netritv ko jawaab dena chahie lekin is aadhaar par sarkaar barkhaast kar di jaae ye baat sanvaidhanik rup se samaj nahin aati he
 Then how many Trinamool Congress leaders have been caught stinging mps and ministers
 vahaan bhi sarkaar barkhaast kii ja sakati he jaise 2014 main maharashtra main chunaav se thik pehle raashtrapati shashan laga diya gaya tha
 In the name of constitutional crisis, the new constitution of crisis is being written, in fact it is not so new
 kitaab kaa cover badla he baaki material vahi he
 This is the first line of a blog written by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley in support of the decision to impose President's rule in Uttarakhand
 agar raashtrapati kii santushti hi vishwaas karne kaa paryaapt aadhaar he to is hisaab se ateet ke tamaam raashtrapati shashan par vishwaas kar lenaa chahie or unhen sanvaidhanik ghoshit kar dena chahie
 Is the Finance Minister ready to put so much trust in the President in the case of President's rule
 unki raay aaj kii he yaa hameshaa se rahi he
 Is this a new constitutional and political scale about President's rule? Then, in the scale the Supreme Court has set in the SR Bommai case, whether this scale is considered final so that His Majesty is satisfied then it means that everything is fine
 dastavezi sakshya hai ki 35 sadasyon ne vidhansabha ke pehle or us samay matvibhaajan kii maang kii thi, lekin iske baavjood viniyog vidheyak matdaan ke bagair paarit hone kaa daawa kiya ja rahaa he
 There is ample evidence that the Appropriation Bill actually fell into the division of votes
 dhyaan dene vaali baat he ki aaj kii taarikh (28 march 2016) tak na to mukhyamantri or na hi vidhansabha ke adhyaksh ne viniyog vidheyak kii pramanit prati rajyapal ke paas bheji he
 It is therefore natural that the Appropriation Bill did not get the approval of the Governor
 is tarah viniyog vidheyak par kathith charchaa or uske paarit hone sambandhi sabhi tathy saaf taur par iske paarit na hone kii ore ishaara karte hai
 There is serious apprehension about the Appropriation Bill
 aaj kii taarikh main vidhansabha adhyaksh dwaara pramanit or rajyapal kii manzuri praapt viniyog vidheyak nahin he
 From the blog of the Finance Minister, we have taken these few lines and put them in a place which is related to the passing or not of the Appropriation Bill
 vitt mantri ye spasht nahin kar rahe hai ki mat vibhaajan hua tha yaa nahin
 If it had happened then with whose permission
 spikar to yahi kah rahe hai mat vibhaajan kii anumati nahin di gai thi
 When the speaker does not give permission, can the member split the vote by himself or does the member ask for a split, then there is no need for the speaker's permission or disagreement
 kya aisa spikar ke adhikaar ko lekar aisi koi parampara he yaa niyam he? To find out the rights of the speaker on the division of votes, we looked at the book by MN Kaul and Shakdhar's very thick book of practice and procedure of parliament

 Jaitley ji has raised a question that the certified copy of the appropriation bill was not sent to Raj Bhavan on March 28

The Chief Minister claims that it was not sent on the 18th but the next day the certified copy was sent to Raj Bhavan

 Does BJP and Congress not take action against their members when this happens? congress ke vidhayakon kaa wheep kaa ulanghan kar bijepi ke paas janaa or bijepi ko gale lagaakar sweekaar kar lenaa kya yah sanvaidhanik rup se sahi he

 Rawat should resign on the basis of the sting, the central leadership of Congress should respond but the government should be dismissed on this basis, it is not constitutionally understood
 tab to trinmul congress ke kitne netaa saansad or mantri sting karte hue pakade gaye hai
 There too, the government can be sacked just as President's rule was imposed in Maharashtra in 2014, just before the elections
 sanvaidhanik sankat ke naam par sankat kaa jo nayaa samvidhan likhaa ja rahaa he, darasal wo itnaa bhi nayaa nahin he
 The cover of the book has changed, the rest of the material is the same
 vitt mantri ke blog se hamane ye chand panktiyaan uthaakar ek jagah rakh di hai jo viniyog vidheyak ke paas hone yaa na hone se sambandhit hai
 The Finance Minister is not making it clear whether the vote was split or not
 agar hua tha to kiski anumati se hua tha
 The speaker is saying this that the division of votes was not allowed
 jab spikar anumati na de to kya sadsy khud se mat vibhaajan kara sakate hai yaa sadsy mat vibhaajan kii maang kar den to spikar kii anumati yaa asahmati kii koi zarurat hi nahin rah jaati
 Is there any such tradition or rule regarding the authority of the speaker? hamane mat-vibhaajan par spikar ke adhikaar jaanane ke liye em en kaul kii kitaab or shakdhar kii bahut hi moti si kitaab practice and procedure of parliament ko palat kar dekha
 Article is not our ability to interpret the law, yet the courage to get prescriptions in the work of older people is our own pleasure
 aap bhi koi nishkarsh nikaale bina in sawaalon kaa lutf uthaaiye kyonki ho saktaa he ki hamaare sawaal hi bachakaane hon
 However, on page 174 of this book it is written that the Speaker's privileges about not allowing division: “vaais vot (dhwani mat) par spikar ke faisle ko bina chunauti die sadsy chaahe to spikar ko apana naam ricard karne ke liye anurodh kar saktaa he
 The Speaker may accept the request if he feels that the matter is important and there is a general opinion in its favor in the House
 '' Nowhere does it seem that the speaker is bound while reading this paragraph
 wo chaahe to anurodh sweekaar kar saktaa he
 For example, many members of the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha opposed how the Aadhaar bill could be presented as a money bill
 magar sabko spikar kaa antim faisla sweekaar karnaa hi padaa
 Here also on page 174 it is written that the speaker can accept the request if there is a general opinion in its favor in the House
 sansad or vidhansabha ke spikar ke adhikaar main samanta hoti he
 The speakers are saying that they have passed by voice vote, the opponents are saying that they have passed with the vote and they are also saying that there was no voting
 main daawey ke saath nahin kah saktaa ki mat vibhaajan ko lekar antim baat kah di gai he yaa nahin
 May be we are lacking in understanding this matter! ab yahaan spikar kii bhoomika par sawaal khadey hote hai
 Even though they are not bound by the rule and cannot be challenged, did the speaker ignore the general opinion in the House
 aaropon or rajbhavan main kiye gaye daavon se to yahi lagata he ki spikar ne aam raay kii andekhi kii or mat vibhaajan ko sweekaar nahin kiya lekin aisa karne kaa unka adhikaar antim he yaa sadasyon kaa
 If the members are not accepted, will it be challenged in the court or in the Raj Bhavan? Is Raj Bhavan above the House? In this case, as much as the role of the speaker seems to be morally doubtful, the doubt is also on the Raj Bhavan
 jetali ji ne ek sawaal uthaaya he ki 28 march kar viniyog vidheyak kii pramanit prati rajbhavan ko nahin bheji gai
 Neither the Chief Minister nor the Speaker sent it, whereas it is the matter of March 18 only
 yahaan yah sawaal uthta he ki jetali ji ke anusaar agar viniyog vidheyak paas hi nahin hua to pramanit prati ke intazaar kaa kya auchity rah jaataa he? pramanit prati to spikar hi apane dastakhat se bhejtaa he to kya use sweekaar karne ke liye rajbhavan baadhya he? mukhyamantri kaa daawa he ki 18 taarikh ko nahin bheji gai magar uske agle din pramanit prati rajbhavan bhej di gai
 The Finance Minister is saying that the certified copy has not been sent till the 28th
 ab ise to tathyon ke dwaara hi sabit kiya ja saktaa he ki koun sahi bol rahaa he
 If the Chief Minister feels that a certified copy has been sent, then he should have presented evidence instead of blank statement
 saarvajanik taur par viniyog vidheyak se jude tathyon par spashtataa zaruri he kyonki isi ke paas hone yaa na hone ko lekar sanvaidhanik sankat kaa daawa kiya ja rahaa he
 Which also shows that 9 Congress mlas have gone with the BJP
 ab sawaal ye he ki viniyog vidheyak rakhte samay koi wheep jari hua tha
 If the whip is issued, can Congress members vote against it? Does not a case of change of party against these 9 mlas become a matter of breaking the whip
 kya bijepi or congress aisa hone par apane sadasyon ke kilaaf karrwai nahin karti hai
 Is it constitutionally correct for Congress mlas to violate the whip and go to BJP and embrace BJP? aap niyam tod kar kisi dal main chale jaayen to kya aap naitik or sanvaidhanik rup se sahi ho sakate hai? The speaker has canceled the membership of these 9 members
 ab unki kanoonee sthiti kya he yah spasht nahin he kyonki vidhansabha to nilambit ho chuki he
 These 9 members will go to the President or to the Governor or to the court to demand their rights
 inaki sadsyta ke faisle par abhi antim faisla baaki he
 If the court reinstates membership, it would be a big moral victory for the BJP even if these 9 members are from the Congress
 uttarakhand main harak singh ravat or assam main hemanth sharma jaise behad eemaandaar chhavi ke netaa bijepi ke paale main gaye to apni samanaantar mahatvakanksha kii khaatir lekin assam main bijepi ne apane saansad ko mukhyamantri kaa ummidavaar banaaya or uttarkhand main bhi kah diya siem unki party kaa hoga
 One should learn from BJP to respect its workers and also make good use of defectors
 bijepi kam se kam harak singh ravat jaise eemaandaar netaaon ke bare main soshal media main prachaar to karvaa hi sakati he ki aise eemaandaar netaaon se rahul gandhi ne milane se inkaar kar diya
 The politics of President's rule is the result of Congress governments
 congress ke gunaah bijepi ke liye vardaan sabit ho rahe hai
 As soon as you question the decision of imposing President's rule in Uttarakhand, some people will come to tell you Congress on social media
 iskaa matlab yah he ki jo gunaah congress ne kiye hai or vahi bijepi kare to uskaa zikr mat karo varna congressi ho jaaoge! ye sab chalata rahegaa
 Harish Rawat also has many questions to answer
 sting main ve bhi kaaphi eemaandaar dikh rahe hai!tippaniyan It is no less ridiculous to base the sting to sack the government
 wo bhi to ek khuleam sting he ki ek party duusari party se kanoon tod kar dal badal kar aae netaaon ko sahaara de rahi he
 There is definitely a moral and legal question about the sting
 sting ke aadhaar par ravat ko istipha dena chahie, congress ke kendriya netritv ko jawaab dena chahie lekin is aadhaar par sarkaar barkhaast kar di jaae ye baat sanvaidhanik rup se samaj nahin aati he
 Then how many Trinamool Congress leaders have been caught stinging mps and ministers
 vahaan bhi sarkaar barkhaast kii ja sakati he jaise 2014 main maharashtra main chunaav se thik pehle raashtrapati shashan laga diya gaya tha
 In the name of constitutional crisis, the new constitution of crisis is being written, in fact it is not so new
 kitaab kaa cover badla he baaki material vahi he
 To find out the rights of the speaker on the division of votes, we looked at the book by MN Kaul and Shakdhar's very thick book of practice and procedure of parliament

 yahaan bhi pej 174 main likhaa he ki spikar anurodh sweekaar kar saktaa he agar house main iske paksh main aam raay ho
 There is equality in the authority of the Speaker of Parliament and the Legislative Assembly
 spikar kah rahe hai dhwani mat se paas hua, virdohi kah rahe hai matvibhaajan se paas hua or yah bhi kah rahe hai ki matvibhaajan hua hi nahin
 i cannot say with certainty whether the final point has been stated about the division of votes
 ho saktaa he is maamle ko samajhane main hamaari hi koi kami ho! Now the role of the speaker is questioned here
 niyam se bhale hi wo baadhya nahin hai or na chunauti di ja sakati he lekin kya spikar ne sadan main aam raay kii andekhi kii
 From the allegations and the claims made at the Raj Bhavan, it seems that the speaker ignored the consensus and did not accept the division of votes but his right to do so is final or that of the members
 agar sadasyon ko sweekaar nahin he to ise chunauti adaalat main di jaaegi yaa rajbhavan main? kya rajbhavan sadan se upar he? is maamle main jitani spikar kii bhoomika naitik rup se sandigdh lagati he utana hi andeh rajbhavan par bhi hota he
 Jaitley ji has raised a question that the certified copy of the appropriation bill was not sent to Raj Bhavan on March 28
 na to mukhyamantri ne bheji na spikar ne jabaki 18 march kaa hi maamla he
 Here the question arises that according to Jaitley ji, if appropriation bill is not passed then what is the justification for waiting for certified copy? If the speaker sends the certified copy by his signature, is the Raj Bhavan obliged to accept it? The Chief Minister claims that it was not sent on the 18th but the next day the certified copy was sent to Raj Bhavan
 vitt mantri kah rahe hai ki 28 taarikh tak pramanit prati nahin bheji gai
 Now it can be proved only by the facts that who is saying the right thing
 agar mukhyamantri ko lagata he ki pramanit prati bheji gai to unhen kore bayaan kii jagah pramaan pesh karnaa chahie tha
 Clarity is required in public on the facts related to the Appropriation Bill as it is claimed to have constitutional crisis with the absence or absence of it
 jo ki ek tarah se dikhataa bhi he ki congress ke 9 vidhayak bijepi ke saath chale gaye hai
 Now the question is whether a whip was issued while placing the Appropriation Bill
 agar wheep jari ho jaae to kya congress ke sadsy khilaaf matdaan kar sakate hai? wheep todane par kya in 9 vidhayakon ke kilaaf dal badal kaa maamla nahin banataa he
 Does BJP and Congress not take action against their members when this happens? congress ke vidhayakon kaa wheep kaa ulanghan kar bijepi ke paas janaa or bijepi ko gale lagaakar sweekaar kar lenaa kya yah sanvaidhanik rup se sahi he
 If you break the rules and go to a party, can you be morally and constitutionally correct? spikar ne in 9 sadasyon kii sadsyta radd kar di he
 Now what is their legal status is not clear because the assembly has been suspended
 ye 9 sadsy apane adhikaron kii maang ko lekar raashtrapati ke paas jaayenge yaa rajyapal ke paas yaa adaalat ke paas
 The final decision is yet to decide on their membership
 agar court ne sadsyta behaal kar di to bijepi ke liye yah badi naitik jeet hogi bhale hi ye 9 sadsy congress ke hai
 Leaders of very honest image like Harak Singh Rawat in Uttarakhand and Hemant Sharma in Assam went to the BJP for the sake of their parallel ambition, but in Assam, the BJP made its MP a candidate for the Chief Minister and in Uttarakhand he also said that the CM would be his party 
 apane kaaryakartaaon kaa sammaan karnaa koi bijepi se siikhe or dalbadaluon kaa acha istemaal karnaa bhi
 The BJP can at least get publicity on social media about honest leaders like Harak Singh Rawat that Rahul Gandhi refused to meet such honest leaders
 raashtrapati shashan kii raajnneeti congress sarkaron kii dein he
 The crimes of the Congress are proving to be a boon for the BJP
 jaise hi aap uttarakhand main raashtrapati shashan lagane ke faisle par sawaal uthaayenge soshal media par kuch log aapako congressi bataane aa jaayenge
 This means that if the Congress has committed the crime and does the BJP, then do not mention it otherwise you will become a Congressman! All this will go on
 harish ravat ko bhi kai sawaalon ke jawaab dene hai
 They also look quite honest in the sting! Comments sarkaar barkhaast karne ke liye sting kaa aadhaar bananaa kam haasyaaspad nahin he
 That too is an open sting that one party is breaking the law from another party and supporting the leaders who have changed the party
 zarur sting ko lekar naitik or kanoonee sawaal banataa he
 Rawat should resign on the basis of the sting, the central leadership of Congress should respond but the government should be dismissed on this basis, it is not constitutionally understood
 tab to trinmul congress ke kitne netaa saansad or mantri sting karte hue pakade gaye hai
 There too, the government can be sacked just as President's rule was imposed in Maharashtra in 2014, just before the elections
 sanvaidhanik sankat ke naam par sankat kaa jo nayaa samvidhan likhaa ja rahaa he, darasal wo itnaa bhi nayaa nahin he
 The cover of the book has changed, the rest of the material is the same
 “vaais vot (dhwani mat) par spikar ke faisle ko bina chunauti die sadsy chaahe to spikar ko apana naam ricard karne ke liye anurodh kar saktaa he
 The Speaker may accept the request if he feels that the matter is important and there is a general opinion in its favor in the House
 '' Nowhere does it seem that the speaker is bound while reading this paragraph
 wo chaahe to anurodh sweekaar kar saktaa he
 For example, many members of the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha opposed how the Aadhaar bill could be presented as a money bill
 magar sabko spikar kaa antim faisla sweekaar karnaa hi padaa
 Here also on page 174 it is written that the speaker can accept the request if there is a general opinion in its favor in the House
 sansad or vidhansabha ke spikar ke adhikaar main samanta hoti he
 The speakers are saying that they have passed by voice vote, the opponents are saying that they have passed with the vote and they are also saying that there was no voting
 main daawey ke saath nahin kah saktaa ki mat vibhaajan ko lekar antim baat kah di gai he yaa nahin
 May be we are lacking in understanding this matter! ab yahaan spikar kii bhoomika par sawaal khadey hote hai
 Even though they are not bound by the rule and cannot be challenged, did the speaker ignore the general opinion in the House
 aaropon or rajbhavan main kiye gaye daavon se to yahi lagata he ki spikar ne aam raay kii andekhi kii or mat vibhaajan ko sweekaar nahin kiya lekin aisa karne kaa unka adhikaar antim he yaa sadasyon kaa
 If the members are not accepted, will it be challenged in the court or in the Raj Bhavan? Is Raj Bhavan above the House? In this case, as much as the role of the speaker seems to be morally doubtful, the doubt is also on the Raj Bhavan
 jetali ji ne ek sawaal uthaaya he ki 28 march kar viniyog vidheyak kii pramanit prati rajbhavan ko nahin bheji gai
 Neither the Chief Minister nor the Speaker sent it, whereas it is the matter of March 18 only
 yahaan yah sawaal uthta he ki jetali ji ke anusaar agar viniyog vidheyak paas hi nahin hua to pramanit prati ke intazaar kaa kya auchity rah jaataa he? pramanit prati to spikar hi apane dastakhat se bhejtaa he to kya use sweekaar karne ke liye rajbhavan baadhya he? mukhyamantri kaa daawa he ki 18 taarikh ko nahin bheji gai magar uske agle din pramanit prati rajbhavan bhej di gai
 The Finance Minister is saying that the certified copy has not been sent till the 28th
 ab ise to tathyon ke dwaara hi sabit kiya ja saktaa he ki koun sahi bol rahaa he
 If the Chief Minister feels that a certified copy has been sent, then he should have presented evidence instead of blank statement
 saarvajanik taur par viniyog vidheyak se jude tathyon par spashtataa zaruri he kyonki isi ke paas hone yaa na hone ko lekar sanvaidhanik sankat kaa daawa kiya ja rahaa he
 Which also shows that 9 Congress mlas have gone with the BJP
 ab sawaal ye he ki viniyog vidheyak rakhte samay koi wheep jari hua tha
 If the whip is issued, can Congress members vote against it? Does not a case of change of party against these 9 mlas become a matter of breaking the whip
 kya bijepi or congress aisa hone par apane sadasyon ke kilaaf karrwai nahin karti hai
 Is it constitutionally correct for Congress mlas to violate the whip and go to BJP and embrace BJP? aap niyam tod kar kisi dal main chale jaayen to kya aap naitik or sanvaidhanik rup se sahi ho sakate hai? The speaker has canceled the membership of these 9 members
 ab unki kanoonee sthiti kya he yah spasht nahin he kyonki vidhansabha to nilambit ho chuki he
 These 9 members will go to the President or to the Governor or to the court to demand their rights
 inaki sadsyta ke faisle par abhi antim faisla baaki he
 If the court reinstates membership, it would be a big moral victory for the BJP even if these 9 members are from the Congress
 uttarakhand main harak singh ravat or assam main hemanth sharma jaise behad eemaandaar chhavi ke netaa bijepi ke paale main gaye to apni samanaantar mahatvakanksha kii khaatir lekin assam main bijepi ne apane saansad ko mukhyamantri kaa ummidavaar banaaya or uttarkhand main bhi kah diya siem unki party kaa hoga
 One should learn from BJP to respect its workers and also make good use of defectors
 bijepi kam se kam harak singh ravat jaise eemaandaar netaaon ke bare main soshal media main prachaar to karvaa hi sakati he ki aise eemaandaar netaaon se rahul gandhi ne milane se inkaar kar diya
 The politics of President's rule is the result of Congress governments
 congress ke gunaah bijepi ke liye vardaan sabit ho rahe hai
 As soon as you question the decision of imposing President's rule in Uttarakhand, some people will come to tell you Congress on social media
 iskaa matlab yah he ki jo gunaah congress ne kiye hai or vahi bijepi kare to uskaa zikr mat karo varna congressi ho jaaoge! ye sab chalata rahegaa
 Harish Rawat also has many questions to answer
 sting main ve bhi kaaphi eemaandaar dikh rahe hai!tippaniyan It is no less ridiculous to base the sting to sack the government
 wo bhi to ek khuleam sting he ki ek party duusari party se kanoon tod kar dal badal kar aae netaaon ko sahaara de rahi he
 There is definitely a moral and legal question about the sting
 sting ke aadhaar par ravat ko istipha dena chahie, congress ke kendriya netritv ko jawaab dena chahie lekin is aadhaar par sarkaar barkhaast kar di jaae ye baat sanvaidhanik rup se samaj nahin aati he
 Then how many Trinamool Congress leaders have been caught stinging mps and ministers
 vahaan bhi sarkaar barkhaast kii ja sakati he jaise 2014 main maharashtra main chunaav se thik pehle raashtrapati shashan laga diya gaya tha
 In the name of constitutional crisis, the new constitution of crisis is being written, in fact it is not so new

 pakistan ke parmaanu kaarykram kaa jawaab dene ke liye bharat ne 1985 main hydrogen bam ko test karne kii taiyaari kii thi
 At that time Rajiv Gandhi was the Prime Minister of the country
 america khufia agency CIA ke haal hi main saarvajanik kiye gaye dastavejon se ye jaankaree mili he

 haalanki CIA ke adhikariyon kaa akalan tha ki antarrashtriya dabaav main bharat pakistan ke parmaanu thikaanon par hamalaa nahin karegaa
 According to him, India considers China a greater threat to security than Pakistan

 The CIA had recommended to the US government that this envoy be sent to meet Rajiv Gandhi, but did not speculate on the outcome of this meeting

 modithhath to uthwaae nahin aapnerajanathasenheen nahin, main dekh rahaa tha
 Everyone's hands were clapping
 rajnathamain shri narendra modi ko bhartiya janata party sansadeey dal kaa netaa chune jane kaa elaan karata hum
 i am delighted and thrilled to be the President of Rajnath Singh Mitro Party
 1977 main jab janata party thi, us samay bhi spasht bahumat hasil hua tha
 At that time, the Janata Party was formed by joining many political parties
 or iske banane kii aupchaarik ghoshnaa chunaav ke baad hui thi
 Then in 1989 this credit goes to the respected Atal ji and Advani ji, who worked to make India's politics two polar and we got good success at that time also
 magar kabhi bhi kisi gaiyrcongressi dal ko spasht bahumat nahin mil paaya tha
 This is the first time this has happened
 aaj ham sab bade gaurav ke saath kah sakate hai
 Today, after the results of the 16th Lok Sabha in 2014, the politics of India has now become Bharatiya Janata Party vs others
 yah hamaare liye gaurav kii baat he
 We started our political journey with a political ideology, a philosophical concept
 main aaj yaad karnaa chahta hum bhartiya jansangh ke sansthaapak swargeey shyama prasad mukherjee ko, swargeey pandit dinadayal upaadhyaay ji ko
 Who dreamed of a self-respecting self-respecting India
 adwani ji or atal ji ne isi ke liye pasinaa bahaya
 i am glad that if we see his dream come true under someone's leadership, he is the respected Narendra Bhai Modi
 jab kabhi is desh main raajnneetik parivartan hue hai
 Then the public has not had such a large participation
 2009 main jahaan par is desh kii janata ne lagbhag 7
 8 crore people voted

 16 crores
 sarvaadhik essi asti saansad bhi bijepi ke hi hai
 Not only this, the states where bjp's presence was considered weak are Odisha, West Bengal, Kerala, Tamil Nadu
 aise rajyon main hamaara vot share badha he
 i do not want to discuss any other political party here
 hamane sakaaratmak muddon par chunaav ladaa
 Congratulations to the people of the country that it did not allow attention to devolve from development and good governance
 kai aise rajya hai, jahaan bijepi ne sabhi siton par vijay praapt kii
 Gujarat, Rajasthan, Goa, Delhi, Himachal, Uttarakhand, Daman Diu, Dadar Nagar Haveli, Chandigarh and Andaman Nicobar
 hamane ladakh se lekar kanyakumari tak vijay praapt kii
 Once there was an election in England
 tab kanjarvative party ne lebar party par vijay praapt kii thi
 People called it historical
 magar us raajnneetik parivartan ke kaaran sirf iconomic policy prabhavit hui thi
 But after this change, India's reputation has increased internationally
 reating karne vaali agency mudi ne bharat ko tripal e katigari main khadaa kar diya he
 We are successful in bringing about cultural and social change, not just economic
 main aaj ke kshan narendra bhai ke hyderabad bhaashan ko yaad karnaa chahta hum
 They said yes we can
 aaj main party adhyaksh ke naate kahana chahta hum
 This will only karenge
 And with this belief, i am saying that as a CM in Gujarat, his governance track record has been
 samast deshavaasiyon ko hardik badhai
 There is a demand in Pakistan for the Nobel Peace Prize to be given to Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan for returning the Indian Air Force Wing Commander Abhinandan Vardhaman to India in a safe manner
 imran khan ne pehali baar is maang par bayaan diya he
 On Monday, he tweeted that i am not eligible for the Nobel Prize
 haalanki, imran khan is twit main bhi kashmiri raag alaapne se nahin chuke
 He wrote that Nobel Peace Prize should be given by the person who resolves the problem of Kashmir as per the wishes of the Kashmiri people
 is samasya ke hal se kshetra main shanti or vikaas lautega
 He wrote that i am not eligible for this award
 i am not worthy of the Nobel Peace prize
 The person worthy of this would be the one who solves the Kashmir dispute according to the wishes of the Kashmiri people and paves the way for peace & human development in the subcontinent
 — Imran Khan (@imrankhanpti)march 4, 2019bataa den ki bharat ne pulavama aatanki hamale ke baad pakistan ke balakot main ghuskar airstrike kii thi
 In this airstrike, the Indian Air Force destroyed the bases of jaish-e-mohammed
 is airstrike ke baad pakistani vayusena bharat kii vayusima main ghus ai thi, jinhen khadedane ke chakkar main bharat kaa ek vimaan pakistan kii seemaa main ja gira tha
 Its wing commander Abhinandan was taken into custody by the Pakistani army, after which India and Pakistan under international pressure handed him back to India within two days
 haalanki, is puri prakriya ko imran khan ne is tarah pesh kiya ki jis tarah vah shanti kaa sandesh de rahe hon
 Since then, a resolution was introduced in the Pakistani Parliament, demanding the Nobel Peace Prize for Imran Khan to calm tensions between India and Pakistan and to avert war
 iske liye soshal media par campan bhi chalaaya gaya or online petishan bhi daali gai he
 Significantly, on one side Imran Khan talks about peace and says that every issue should be resolved by dialogue, on the other hand his army is continuously violating the ceasefire at the border
 bharat kii airstrike ke baad pakistan or bhi baukhala gaya he or border par aam logon ko nishaanaa bana rahaa he
 If the agreement fails on the much-awaited Greece crisis, the Reserve Bank may have to push $ 15 billion into the market to stop the rupee at Rs 65 against the dollar

 The crisis-ridden Greek government will have to compromise with the European Union and other global lenders to avoid default in repaying debts

 The three youths have alleged that a Mumbai Police patrol misbehaved with them when they went to the 'gateway of India' for a holiday on Sunday
 unke is aarope ke baad adhikariyon ne maamle main jaanch ke aadesh die hai
 The incident took place at four o'clock in the morning at the 'gateway of India' in southern Mumbai, when the three youths gathered there to spend the weekend

 The youths lodged their complaints on Monday and alleged that as they were talking, a police patrol vehicle came to them and a commotion ensued between the policemen and them
 police ke ek varisht adhikari ne mangalvaar ko kaha, 'yuvakon ke is aarope kii jaanch ke aadesh die gaye hai ki jab ve getwe of india ke paas baithe the, pulicekarmiyon ne unke saath durvyavhaar kiya or kuch aapattijanak shabdon kaa prayog kiya

 ) loksabhaa chunaav kii aahat ke saath hi ayodhya main ek baar phir sargarmi tej ho gai he
 The reason for the new dagger is the fourteen Kosi Pad Yatra declared by the VHP
 uttar pradesh kii sapa sarkaar ko lagata he kii yatra ke bahaane bijepi ram mandir mudda ek baar phir garmane or ashaanti failaane kii koshish main he
 Therefore, the Uttar Pradesh government refused to allow the Chaurasi Kosi yatra to Ayodhya to be proposed by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) from 25 August to 13 September
 upi sarkaar ke is faisle ke baad faijabad or ayodhya main dhara 144 lagu kar diya gaya he
 Faizabad District Magistrate Vipin Kumar issued a notification in this regard
 grih vibhaag ke pramukh sachiv aar
 M
 shrivastav ne bataaya ki churaasi kosi yatra paramparaagat rup se caitra poornima se baisaakh kii poornima ke bich hoti he
 Accordingly, this journey has taken place between 25 April to 20 May
 aise main VHP kii prastaavit yatra se ek nayi parampara kii shuruyaat hoti, jise anuchit maanate hue rajya sarkaar ne ise nikaalane kii ijaajat dene se inkaar kar diya he
 He said that the Ayodhya Chaurasi Kosi Yatra passes through six districts Faizabad, Barabanki, Gonda, Ambedkarnagar, Basti and Bahraich
 in janapadon ke jiladhikariyon tathaa police captainon se is silsile main vichaar-vimarsh kiya gaya tha
 They all decided not to order the removal of the yatra, calling the beginning of this new tradition unreasonable
 shrivastav ne bataaya ki VHP ke netaa ashok singhl ne gat 10 agast ko pradesh sarkaar ko likhe patr main 25 agast se 13 sitambar ke bich churaasi kosi yatra nikaalane kii ijaajat maangi thi
 In the letter, he said that he wants to take this journey so that the Ram temple can be constructed in Ayodhya
 25 agast se prarambh hone vaali is yatra ke dauraan raste main sabha kar ram mandir ke liye yatra main shaamil VHP padaadhikari or desh bhar se aaye sadhu -sant logo se samarthan maangegein
 Now after the decision of the UP government, not only the politics has started on the yatra, but the UP government has also started preparations to stop it with full force
 udhar sadhu -sant bhi puri tarah qamar kas kar har haal main chaudaa kosi pariderma karne par amaadaa he
 Due to which Ayodhya has become restless once again
 gandhi jayanti kaa yah dedh saunva saal shuru ho gaya he
 Last year was the hundredth year of the Champaran Satyagraha when Gandhi visited Champaran in 1917
 is 2 aktubar se agle 2 aktubar kii tak gandhi ko yaad karne ke liye bahut se sarkari kaaryakarm honge
 Amidst these programs, the content of what is going on inside the whatsapp University about Gandhiji should also be published
 gandhi har kisi ke liye uplabdh hai
 For those who want, also for those who hate
 sabko lagata he ki unhen gandhi ke bare main sab pataa he
 People who are older than age have many books to know Gandhi
 jo bachche hai unke liye bhi kitabe hai magar pichley kuch maheenon main bacchon ke liye do aisi kitaaben ai hai jinke bare main baat honi chahie
 If the children have to tell about Gandhi's heavy life, then how will he tell them? yah chunauti to he hi
 We have made a story by combining several parts of the book we will talk about
 mohan ek saahsee balak nahin tha
 Like many other children, he was afraid of ghosts, bandits and snakes
 laaj itani aati thi ki skool main kisi se baat karne main sakuchaata tha
 Afraid that if he would talk to others, they would make fun of him
 zarurat se zyaada baat na to shikshakon se karata tha or na hi apane sahpaathiyon se
 It was only after hour, he entered the school and returned home like an arrow when he was discharged
 gujarat main ek skool main safai ho rahi thi
 Some old test results were found in an old bundle of papers
 inamen mahatma gandhi ke bachapan kaa report-card bhi nikal aayaa
 There was great curiosity, to know how Mohan was a student
 reportcard se kuch baaten pataa chalati hai, kuch nahin bhi samaj aatin
 In 1881, Mohan passed in arithmetic and in Gujarati
 bhugol main jin teen chaatro ko ek bhi number nahin mila tha, unamem mohan kaa naam bhi tha
 At the end of the year, it was ranked 32nd in a class of 34 students
 yani phiseddi
 Mohan was an ordinary student
 na to bahut budhimaan or na hi ekadam budhu
 Even the body was not very agile
 khelkud main hissaa nahin letaa tha, lekin paidal chalane kaa khub abhyaas tha
 Then was there no quality in Mohan? aisa kaise ho saktaa he? har vyakti main kuch-na kuch gun hote hai, mohan main bhi the
 There was great curiosity in him
 jo bhi uske man ko lubhaata, use samajhane main jute jaataa
 Hard work, open heart
 skool college kii padhai puri kii, lekin mohan ko mahatma banane vaali shiksha to mohandas ko jivan se hi mili
 He benefited from reading good things, but more than that he learned by trying himself
 kuch log padhane-samajhane ke liye prayogshaala jate hai
 Bapu had made his life a laboratory
 zarurat padi to kitaaben kareed kar kapade achche se dhonaa siikhaa, bhojan pakaana siikhaa, ambulance or nurse kaa kaam bhi sikh liya, charkha chalaanaa or kapade bunana bhi
 Hair cutting and tamil-urdu also learned improvisation
 gandhi ji ke seekhney-padhane ke peeche degree paa kar naukari karne kii ichha kam hi thi
 He had learned the work of making shoes from a friend of his
 us samay daftaron main log juute pahante the
 But Mahondas started wearing slippers or sandals with trousers, as they are more comfortable than shoes in hot areas
 unki dekhadekhi chappal or sandals pahanane kaa fishan chal niklaa tha
 Once along with Jawaharlal Nehru and Sardar Patel, some Congress leaders came to Sevagram Ashram in Maharashtra
 unhen intazaar karnaa padaa kyonki gandhi ji kuch logon ko chamade se chappal bananaa sikhaa rahe the
 When he complained, Gandhiji told him that they too should learn to make shoe slippers
 baad main san 1932 main angrej sarkaar ne unhen sardaar patel ke saath jail main daal diya
 Sardar needed shoes, but there was no cobbler in jail
 gandhiji ne unase kaha chamada mil jaae, to ve hi sardaar ke liye juuta bana sakate hai
 He told that some people kept his made slippers in such a way that it was a heritage
 jail main rahete hue mohandas kii sarkaar ke aalaa adhikari general smats ke saath chitthee-patri hui
 These were the officers that caused Mohandas to go to jail again and again
 san 1913 main ek patr main unhone general smats ko bataaya ki ve 15 sandals bana chuke hai
 Also, if the general sends the measurement of his foot, he will make sandals for them too
 san 1914 main jab ve jail se reeha hue or dakshin africa sadaa ke liye chhod bharat lautne lage, tab mohandas ne yah sandals general smats ko bhent di
 On his return to India, he came in desi clothes
 aise hi kapadon main gandhi ji champaran ke kisaanon kaa haal jaanane ke liye san 1917 main bihar aae
 One day he saw a woman in a very dirty sari
 unhone kasturba se kaha- usase kaho ki apane kapade saaf kiya kare, nahaaya kare
 She replied to Kasturba - i have only one sari
 agar ise dhoungi to pahanuungi kya? baapu se kah kar ek or sari dilava dijie, rose nahaakar sari bhi dho luungi
 Gandhiji went to Bharara after hearing the condition of that poor woman
 unhone kalpana bhi nahin kii thi ki unke deshvasi aisi daridrata main rahete hai
 He also understood the relation between poverty and cleanliness
 is ghatana kaa gandhi ji par gaharaa asar hua, itnaa ki unka pahanava bhi badalane laga
 The son of a rich diwan, who lived abroad in expensive clothes and suit-boots, was wearing a dhoti-like dhoti, like a poor laborer
 jin logon ke bhale ke liye vah kaam karnaa chaahate the, unke jaise hi ho gaye the
 The comments san 1947 main jab bharat azaad hua tab mohan 78 saal kaa ho gaya tha
 All believe that Mohandas Gandhi was the greatest leader of our freedom struggle
 yani hamaare darpok mohan ne keval apane man se nahin, desh bhar ke logon ke man se dar nikaal diya tha
 Sopan Joshi has written two books
 ek tha mohan 9veen se 12veen ke chaatro ke liye or baapu kii paati teesri se aathvin ke chaatro ke liye
 This book is in Hindi teesri class ke bacchon vaali kitaab ko bihar sarkaar ne sabhi skulon main lagu bhi kiya he
 Because this book was made by Nitish Kumar during the Champaran Satyagraha century
 bihar ke skulon main rose subah iskaa ek chapter padhaa jaataa hoga yaa nahin, yah to bihar ke log hi bataa sakate hai magar is kitaab main yahi likhaa he ki aisa kiya jaae
 The book also praises a painter who made Gandhi child accessible to children
 jinka naam he somesh kumaar
 To know if there is anything new about Gandhi
 
 
 khaskar bacchon ko gandhi ke bare main kaise bataaen wo bhi bina 2 aktubar ke
 Mohan was not a courageous child
 bahut se duusare bacchon kii tarah hi use bhoot-pret kaa, daakuon kaa, saanp kaa dar laga rahata tha
 Laj was so comfortable that she was able to talk to anyone in school
 darataa tha ki dusron se baat karegaa, to ve uskaa mazaaq udaayenge
 Neither spoke excessively to teachers nor to his classmates
 ghanta bajane par hi vidhyalay main ghusata or chuttee hote hi tir kii tarah ghar laut jaataa
 a school was cleaning in Gujarat
 kaagazon ke ek puraane pulindia main kuch puraane parikshafal mili
 The report card of Mahatma Gandhi's childhood also came out
 badi jigyaasa thi, yah jaanane ke liye ki mohan kaisaa chaatr tha
 Some things are known from the reportcard, some do not even understand
 san 1881 main mohan ankaganit main or gujarati main paas ho gaya tha
 Mohan's name was also among the three students who did not get a single number in Geography
 saal ke akhir main 34 chaatro kii kaksha main uskaa sthaan 32waan tha
 That is laggards
 mohan saadhaaran sa chaatr tha
 Neither very intelligent nor very foolish
 sharir se bhi bahut phutila nahin tha
 Did not participate in sports, but there was a lot of walking practice
 phir kya mohan main koi bhi kubi nahin thi? How can this be possible? Every person has some qualities, even in Mohan
 usamen gajab kii jigyaasa thi
 Whoever wooed his mind, would get engaged in understanding it
 mehnat se, khule man se
 The school completed college, but Mohandas got the education that made Mohan a Mahatma
 acchhee baaten padhane se unhen phayda hua, par usase kahin zyaada laabh khud azamkar sikhi baton se
 Some people go to the laboratory for reading and understanding
 baapu ne apane jivan ko hi prayogshaala bana liya tha
 If needed, by buying books, i learned to wash clothes, learned to cook food, learned ambulance and nurse work, spinning and weaving clothes
 bal kaatna or tamil-urdu bhi kaamchalaoo sikh lee
 There was little desire to get a job after getting a degree behind Gandhi ji's learning and reading
 juute banane kaa kaam unhone apane ek dost siikhaa tha
 At that time people used to wear shoes in offices
 lekin mahondas ne patalun ke saath chappal yaa sandals pahananaa shuru kar diya, kyonki garm ilaakon main ye juuton kii tulana main aaraamdeh rahete hai
 His fashion wearing slippers and sandals was out
 ek baar jawaharlal nehru or sardaar patel ke saath congress ke kuch netaa maharashtra ke sewagram ashram aae
 He had to wait because Gandhiji was teaching some people to make slippers from leather
 jab unhone shikaayat kii, to gandhi ji ne unase kaha ki ve log bhi juuta chappal bananaa seekhen
 Later in 1932, the British Government jailed him with Sardar Patel

 Gandhiji told him that if he finds leather, then only he can make a shoe for the Sardar

 While in jail, a letter was written with General Smuts, a top official of Mohandas's government
 yahi ve adhikari the jinaki vajah se mohandas ko baar-baar jail janaa padataa tha
 In a letter in 1913, he told General Smuts that he had made 15 sandals
 yah bhi ki agar general apane pair kaa naap bhej den to unke liye bhi sandals bana denge
 In 1914, when he was released from prison and left South Africa forever and returned to India, Mohandas presented this sandal to General Smuts
 bharat lautne par vah desi kapadon main aa gaye the
 In similar clothes, Gandhiji came to Bihar in 1917 to know the condition of the Champaran farmers
 vahaan ek din unhone ek aurat ko bahut gandi sari main dekha
 He told Kasturba - tell him to clean his clothes, take a bath
 usne kasturba ko jawaab diya- mere paas ek hi sari he
 Will i wear it if i wash it? Ask Bapu and get another saree, after bathing daily, you will also wash the saree
 us nirdhan mahila kaa haal sunakar gandhi ji bharra gaye
 He did not even imagine that his countrymen lived in such poverty
 unhen garibi or safai kaa rishta bhi samaj aa gaya
 This incident had a profound impact on Gandhiji, so much so that his dress also changed
 ek sampann dewan kaa betaa, jo videsh main mahange kapade or suut-boot main rahaa tha, aisi langot jaisi dhoti pahanane laga tha, jaisi ekadam garib mazdoor kisaan pahante the

 Whose name is Somesh Kumar
 kya gandhi ke bare main kuch nayaa he jaanane ke liye
 
 
 Especially how to tell children about Gandhi without that too on 2 October
 gujarat main ek skool main safai ho rahi thi
 Some old test results were found in an old bundle of papers
 inamen mahatma gandhi ke bachapan kaa report-card bhi nikal aayaa
 There was great curiosity, to know how Mohan was a student
 reportcard se kuch baaten pataa chalati hai, kuch nahin bhi samaj aatin
 In 1881, Mohan passed in arithmetic and in Gujarati
 bhugol main jin teen chaatro ko ek bhi number nahin mila tha, unamem mohan kaa naam bhi tha
 At the end of the year, it was ranked 32nd in a class of 34 students
 yani phiseddi
 Mohan was an ordinary student
 na to bahut budhimaan or na hi ekadam budhu
 Even the body was not very agile
 khelkud main hissaa nahin letaa tha, lekin paidal chalane kaa khub abhyaas tha
 Then was there no quality in Mohan? aisa kaise ho saktaa he? har vyakti main kuch-na kuch gun hote hai, mohan main bhi the
 There was great curiosity in him
 jo bhi uske man ko lubhaata, use samajhane main jute jaataa
 Hard work, open heart
 skool college kii padhai puri kii, lekin mohan ko mahatma banane vaali shiksha to mohandas ko jivan se hi mili
 He benefited from reading good things, but more than that he learned by trying himself
 kuch log padhane-samajhane ke liye prayogshaala jate hai
 Bapu had made his life a laboratory
 zarurat padi to kitaaben kareed kar kapade achche se dhonaa siikhaa, bhojan pakaana siikhaa, ambulance or nurse kaa kaam bhi sikh liya, charkha chalaanaa or kapade bunana bhi
 Hair cutting and tamil-urdu also learned improvisation
 gandhi ji ke seekhney-padhane ke peeche degree paa kar naukari karne kii ichha kam hi thi
 He had learned the work of making shoes from a friend of his
 us samay daftaron main log juute pahante the
 But Mahondas started wearing slippers or sandals with trousers, as they are more comfortable than shoes in hot areas
 unki dekhadekhi chappal or sandals pahanane kaa fishan chal niklaa tha
 Once along with Jawaharlal Nehru and Sardar Patel, some Congress leaders came to Sevagram Ashram in Maharashtra
 unhen intazaar karnaa padaa kyonki gandhi ji kuch logon ko chamade se chappal bananaa sikhaa rahe the
 When he complained, Gandhiji told him that they too should learn to make shoe slippers
 baad main san 1932 main angrej sarkaar ne unhen sardaar patel ke saath jail main daal diya
 Sardar needed shoes, but there was no cobbler in jail
 gandhiji ne unase kaha chamada mil jaae, to ve hi sardaar ke liye juuta bana sakate hai
 He told that some people kept his made slippers in such a way that it was a heritage
 jail main rahete hue mohandas kii sarkaar ke aalaa adhikari general smats ke saath chitthee-patri hui
 These were the officers that caused Mohandas to go to jail again and again
 san 1913 main ek patr main unhone general smats ko bataaya ki ve 15 sandals bana chuke hai
 Also, if the general sends the measurement of his foot, he will make sandals for them too
 san 1914 main jab ve jail se reeha hue or dakshin africa sadaa ke liye chhod bharat lautne lage, tab mohandas ne yah sandals general smats ko bhent di
 On his return to India, he came in desi clothes
 aise hi kapadon main gandhi ji champaran ke kisaanon kaa haal jaanane ke liye san 1917 main bihar aae
 One day he saw a woman in a very dirty sari
 unhone kasturba se kaha- usase kaho ki apane kapade saaf kiya kare, nahaaya kare
 She replied to Kasturba - i have only one sari
 agar ise dhoungi to pahanuungi kya? baapu se kah kar ek or sari dilava dijie, rose nahaakar sari bhi dho luungi
 Gandhiji went to Bharara after hearing the condition of that poor woman
 unhone kalpana bhi nahin kii thi ki unke deshvasi aisi daridrata main rahete hai
 He also understood the relation between poverty and cleanliness
 is ghatana kaa gandhi ji par gaharaa asar hua, itnaa ki unka pahanava bhi badalane laga
 The son of a rich diwan, who lived abroad in expensive clothes and suit-boots, was wearing a dhoti-like dhoti, like a poor laborer
 jin logon ke bhale ke liye vah kaam karnaa chaahate the, unke jaise hi ho gaye the
 The comments san 1947 main jab bharat azaad hua tab mohan 78 saal kaa ho gaya tha
 All believe that Mohandas Gandhi was the greatest leader of our freedom struggle
 yani hamaare darpok mohan ne keval apane man se nahin, desh bhar ke logon ke man se dar nikaal diya tha
 Sopan Joshi has written two books
 ek tha mohan 9veen se 12veen ke chaatro ke liye or baapu kii paati teesri se aathvin ke chaatro ke liye
 This book is in Hindi teesri class ke bacchon vaali kitaab ko bihar sarkaar ne sabhi skulon main lagu bhi kiya he
 Because this book was made by Nitish Kumar during the Champaran Satyagraha century
 bihar ke skulon main rose subah iskaa ek chapter padhaa jaataa hoga yaa nahin, yah to bihar ke log hi bataa sakate hai magar is kitaab main yahi likhaa he ki aisa kiya jaae
 The book also praises a painter who made Gandhi child accessible to children
 jinka naam he somesh kumaar
 To know if there is anything new about Gandhi
 
 
 khaskar bacchon ko gandhi ke bare main kaise bataaen wo bhi bina 2 aktubar ke
 Some things are known from the reportcard, some do not even understand
 san 1881 main mohan ankaganit main or gujarati main paas ho gaya tha
 Mohan's name was also among the three students who did not get a single number in Geography
 saal ke akhir main 34 chaatro kii kaksha main uskaa sthaan 32waan tha
 That is laggards
 mohan saadhaaran sa chaatr tha
 Neither very intelligent nor very foolish
 sharir se bhi bahut phutila nahin tha
 Did not participate in sports, but there was a lot of walking practice
 phir kya mohan main koi bhi kubi nahin thi? How can this be possible? Every person has some qualities, even in Mohan
 usamen gajab kii jigyaasa thi
 Whoever wooed his mind, would get engaged in understanding it
 mehnat se, khule man se
 The school completed college, but Mohandas got the education that made Mohan a Mahatma
 acchhee baaten padhane se unhen phayda hua, par usase kahin zyaada laabh khud azamkar sikhi baton se
 Some people go to the laboratory for reading and understanding
 baapu ne apane jivan ko hi prayogshaala bana liya tha
 If needed, by buying books, i learned to wash clothes, learned to cook food, learned ambulance and nurse work, spinning and weaving clothes
 bal kaatna or tamil-urdu bhi kaamchalaoo sikh lee
 There was little desire to get a job after getting a degree behind Gandhi ji's learning and reading
 juute banane kaa kaam unhone apane ek dost siikhaa tha
 At that time people used to wear shoes in offices
 lekin mahondas ne patalun ke saath chappal yaa sandals pahananaa shuru kar diya, kyonki garm ilaakon main ye juuton kii tulana main aaraamdeh rahete hai
 His fashion wearing slippers and sandals was out
 ek baar jawaharlal nehru or sardaar patel ke saath congress ke kuch netaa maharashtra ke sewagram ashram aae
 He had to wait because Gandhiji was teaching some people to make slippers from leather
 jab unhone shikaayat kii, to gandhi ji ne unase kaha ki ve log bhi juuta chappal bananaa seekhen
 Later in 1932, the British Government jailed him with Sardar Patel
 sardaar ko juuton kii zarurat thi, lekin jail main koi mochi tha hi nahin
 Gandhiji told him that if he finds leather, then only he can make a shoe for the Sardar

 He had learned the work of making shoes from a friend of his
 us samay daftaron main log juute pahante the
 But Mahondas started wearing slippers or sandals with trousers, as they are more comfortable than shoes in hot areas
 unki dekhadekhi chappal or sandals pahanane kaa fishan chal niklaa tha
 Once along with Jawaharlal Nehru and Sardar Patel, some Congress leaders came to Sevagram Ashram in Maharashtra
 unhen intazaar karnaa padaa kyonki gandhi ji kuch logon ko chamade se chappal bananaa sikhaa rahe the
 When he complained, Gandhiji told him that they too should learn to make shoe slippers
 baad main san 1932 main angrej sarkaar ne unhen sardaar patel ke saath jail main daal diya
 Sardar needed shoes, but there was no cobbler in jail
 gandhiji ne unase kaha chamada mil jaae, to ve hi sardaar ke liye juuta bana sakate hai
 He told that some people kept his made slippers in such a way that it was a heritage
 jail main rahete hue mohandas kii sarkaar ke aalaa adhikari general smats ke saath chitthee-patri hui
 These were the officers that caused Mohandas to go to jail again and again
 san 1913 main ek patr main unhone general smats ko bataaya ki ve 15 sandals bana chuke hai
 Also, if the general sends the measurement of his foot, he will make sandals for them too
 san 1914 main jab ve jail se reeha hue or dakshin africa sadaa ke liye chhod bharat lautne lage, tab mohandas ne yah sandals general smats ko bhent di
 On his return to India, he came in desi clothes
 aise hi kapadon main gandhi ji champaran ke kisaanon kaa haal jaanane ke liye san 1917 main bihar aae
 One day he saw a woman in a very dirty sari
 unhone kasturba se kaha- usase kaho ki apane kapade saaf kiya kare, nahaaya kare
 She replied to Kasturba - i have only one sari
 agar ise dhoungi to pahanuungi kya? baapu se kah kar ek or sari dilava dijie, rose nahaakar sari bhi dho luungi
 Gandhiji went to Bharara after hearing the condition of that poor woman
 unhone kalpana bhi nahin kii thi ki unke deshvasi aisi daridrata main rahete hai
 He also understood the relation between poverty and cleanliness
 is ghatana kaa gandhi ji par gaharaa asar hua, itnaa ki unka pahanava bhi badalane laga
 The son of a rich diwan, who lived abroad in expensive clothes and suit-boots, was wearing a dhoti-like dhoti, like a poor laborer
 jin logon ke bhale ke liye vah kaam karnaa chaahate the, unke jaise hi ho gaye the
 The comments san 1947 main jab bharat azaad hua tab mohan 78 saal kaa ho gaya tha
 All believe that Mohandas Gandhi was the greatest leader of our freedom struggle
 yani hamaare darpok mohan ne keval apane man se nahin, desh bhar ke logon ke man se dar nikaal diya tha

 While in jail, a letter was written with General Smuts, a top official of Mohandas's government
 yahi ve adhikari the jinaki vajah se mohandas ko baar-baar jail janaa padataa tha
 In a letter in 1913, he told General Smuts that he had made 15 sandals
 yah bhi ki agar general apane pair kaa naap bhej den to unke liye bhi sandals bana denge
 In 1914, when he was released from prison and left South Africa forever and returned to India, Mohandas presented this sandal to General Smuts

 In similar clothes, Gandhiji came to Bihar in 1917 to know the condition of the Champaran farmers
 vahaan ek din unhone ek aurat ko bahut gandi sari main dekha
 He told Kasturba - tell him to clean his clothes, take a bath

 Will i wear it if i wash it? Ask Bapu and get another saree, after bathing daily, you will also wash the saree
 us nirdhan mahila kaa haal sunakar gandhi ji bharra gaye
 He did not even imagine that his countrymen lived in such poverty

 While the entire focus of sonia-rahul was on the program, Priyanka's eyes were on that everything should go on smoothly by default

 jis bandook se jodhpur ke nazadik kankaani ilaake main ek or do aktubar 1998 kii raat do kaale hiranon kaa shikaar kiya gaya wo bandook kiski thi? wo bandook us raat kiske paas thi? us bandook se us raat kisne goli chalaai thi? zaahir he jiske paas bandak thi or jisane goli chalaai vahiin gunahagaar he
 Now if the Chief Judicial Magistrate of Jodhpur read the verdict of the court, the gun was with Salman Khan that night and Salman Khan shot at the black deer
 magar rajasthan hoicourt kii jodhpur bench ke 25 july 2016 ke faisle ko padhe to salmaan khan ke paas us raat koi bandook hi nahin thi
 That is why he was also released in the Arms Act
 kya ek or do aktubar 1998 kii darmyaani raat kosalman khaanane jodhpur se 35 kilometre dur kankani ilaake main do kaale hiranon kaa shikaar akele kiya tha? kya saf ali khan, tabboo, neelam or sonaali bendre bas gypsy main sirf saath baithe the? kya donon hiranon kaa shikaar goli maar kar kiya gaya tha? or kya goli salmaan khan ne chalaai thi?us faisle kii copy ajtak ke paas he, jisamen jodhpur ke chif jeudicial magistrate kii court ne kankani main do kaale hiran ke shikaar ke maamle main salmaan khan ko doshi qaraar dete hue paanch saal kii sazaa sunai he
 In this, along with the complete information of the night of the incident, the statements of the forest officer, investigating officer and all the eyewitnesses are also recorded
 itnaa hi nahin isamen ye bhi likhaa he ki postmortem report ke mutabik donon kaale hiranon kii maut goli ke chharre lagane se hui
 This means that the hunter also had a gun and that the hunt took place with the gun
 magar wo bandook hai kahaan? pichley bees saalon main kabhi wo bandook kyon nahin mili? or agar wo bandook salmaan khan kii hi thi to phir 18 janvari 2017 ko jodhpur seshan court ne arms act main salmaan khan ko bari kaise kar diya?darasal arms act kaa maamla or kankani main dokale hiranon ke shikaraka maamla ek hi cese ke do pahalu hai
 According to the claim of the investigating officer, the gun license with which Salman Khan had hunted had already expired
 isi vajah se salmaan khan par arms act ke tahat maamla banaaya gaya
 But the gun that the investigating officer talked about was neither recovered from the gypsy in which the victim was seated nor from the room in Umaid Bhawan where Salman or the rest of the stars were staying
 haalanki vaardaat ke fouran baad agali subah or phir saat aktubar 1998 ko baqayada van vibhaag ne gypsy kii talaashi bhi lee thi magar mila kuch nahin
 Rather, a gun was later recovered from Salman's Mumbai home
 iske baad shikaar ke barahawein din yani 12 aktubar 1998 ko dobaaraa talaashi lene par van vibhaag ne shikaar main istemaal gypsy se point tu revolver or point tu raifal ke chharre or khokhe milane ke daawey jarur kiye
 But all those pellets and kiosks were brand new
 jabaki 12 din tak gypsy main pade rahane or barish ke baad usamen zang lag janaa chahie tha
 But this did not happen
 itnaa hi nahin baad main forensik jaanch se pataa chalaa ki jin chharron or goliyon se donon kaale hiran kii maut hui he wo salmaan kii bandook se chali hi nahin thi
 Rather, the bullet was fired by another gun
 par wo koun si bandook thi ye aaj tak nahin pataa
 On these grounds, the Jodhpur Sessions Court acquitted Salman Khan in the Arms Act on 18 January 2017
 magar ab usee maamlen main chif jeudicial magistrate kii court ne salmaan khan ko do kaale hiranon ko goli maarane kaa doshi qaraar diya he
 Therefore, law experts are raising the question that when Salman is acquitted in one case of the same case then how can he be guilty in another? Salman's lawyer has raised this issue most prominently for surety in the sessions court

 akhilesh kii aguwai main vidhasanabha chunaav main utarane vaali sapa ne 224 siten jitkar itihaas banaaya

 # hardikpandya # aalimhakim # salonhakimsaalim # teamhakimsaalim # harocks 🤘A post shared by Salon Hakim's Aalim (@aalimhakim) onjul 17, 2017 at 2:54am PDT The CBI, which has disagreed on various issues related to the Lokpal, has also got the support of Team Anna, who said that the suggestions of the Standing Committee are dangerous and should be rejected
 team anna ke sadsy arvind kejariwal ne kaha, ham sibiai ke virodh kaa samarthan karte hai or maanate hai ki sthaayee samiti kii report khatarnaak he or ise khaarij kiya janaa chahie
 He said that if the recommendations were implemented, it would cripple the functioning of the CBI
 kejariwal ne kaha, sabhi maamalon ke liye praarambhik jaanch anivaary kar die jane se bhrasht logon ko yah pataa chal saktaa he ki ve sibiai kii najar main hai or chapa padane se pehle hi ve khud ko bachaa sakate hai
 "we support the CBI argument and they are rightly opposing the recommendations," he said
 kejariwal ne aarope lagaaya ki sarkaar hajaare ke abhiyaan kaa istemaal sibiai kii bhoomika ko halkaa karne ke liye kar rahi he
 Kejriwal's statement came at a time when the CBI wrote a letter to the Department of Personnel and Training that the proposed move to make a preliminary inquiry by the Lokpal mandatory before the CBI is given to a CBI agency against corruption cases Will severely damage the effectiveness of
 sibiai ke sutron ne bataaya ki is prastaavit kadam se agency apane stabdh karne dene vaale tatv arthath talaashi abhiyaan shuru karne ko kho degi
 According to the letter, at present, the agency collects information from various sources, makes plans and conducts search operations to obtain documents and evidence

 But despite this, the preparation of the district police was that even a single gun could not fire

 However, after the video of the incident went viral, the district police has now ordered an inquiry

 Meanwhile, BSFK DG has made a big statement about the activities of Pakistan and its aggressive attitude
 biguef ke diji keke sharma ne apni press conference main kaha ki imran khan kii sarkaar aane ke baad bhi pakistan ke ravaie main koi badlaav nahin aayaa he
 Pakistan's offensive on the Line of Control (loc) and the International Border (IB) has come after Imran's government
 yah baat isse bhi sabit hoti he ki unhone kis tareeke se biguef ke head consteble narendra singh ko maaraa
 Sharma said, "even after the new government of Pakistan has come, nothing has changed on the border
 ham to ye kah sakate hai ki nai sarkaar aane ke baad international border auratmauchh par pakistanka agreshan badha he
 The BSF DG also said that terrorists are present at the launch pad adjacent to the border
 aatank ko badhanaa pakistan kii policy he
 He is still sending terrorists from across the border and trying to infiltrate them
 pakistan to jiyaul haq kii policy ko follow kar rahaa he
 DG KK Sharma said, 'our jawan Narendra Singh was killed by Pakistan's BAT team
 ye ghatana behad durbhypurna he
 Jawan Narendra Singh was strangled
 usko 3 goliyaan bhi maari gai thim
 Sharma said, 'we have started replying to Pakistan on loc
 ab international border kii taraf se unke khilaaf kya karrvaai kii jaaegi, is par ham faisla karenge
 He said that in view of India's stand, Pakistan has evacuated its villages along the International Border
 biguef ke mutabik pakistan kii rangers ne karrwai ke dar se is ilaake main apni sahaayta ke liye regular army ko bhi bula liya he
 According to the information, Pakistan has evacuated most of the villages 5 kilometers across this international border
 sharma ne bataaya ki pakistan ko is baat kaa dar he kibiesedgar kadi karrwai karata he, to pakistan ko baari nuksaan ho saktaa he
 This is the reason that due to the fear of BSF, Pakistan has also placed its mortar position at many places across the International Border
 iske pehle jab bhi pakistan kii taraf se hamalaa hua, tab-tab bisaef ne makul jawaab diya he
 Regarding the BAT, Sharma said that for the first time across the international border, Pakistan has executed this type of incident
 isse pehle BAT ne international border ke aasapaas is tareeke kii ghatana ko anjaam nahin diya tha
 According to KK Sharma, the border action team has attacked the soldiers several times in the loc area, but it is seen for the first time that the BAT attacked this way near the International Border
 seemaa paar kai aatanki lonching padakeke sharma ne kaha ki isamen koi shankaa nahin he ki seemaa paar kai aatanki lonching pad hai
 Many times, the launching pads of terrorists are only five to seven km away from the border
 unhone kaha ki isamen koi ashanka nahin he ki takanic se chunautiyaan aasaan hui hai
 In future our borders will be more secure

 skim kii rakam itani badi he ki agar use number main likhen to aap number ginate rah jaaenge
 One lakh 25 thousand crore i
e
 food security scheme of Rs 1
25 lakh crore, which this government is considering as its biggest success
 lekin is yojana kaa kaala sach ajtak ne sabake saamne laa diya he
 Poverty will end in the country and hunger will be eradicated in the country with the slogans like law has been made and bidding has been done for wheat 2 rupees, rice 3 rupees kg
 sansad se lekar sadakon tak sarkaar elaan kar chuki he ki sava lakh karod kii rakam kharch kii jaayegi or ghar-ghar tak garibon ko gehun-chaaval pahunchaaya jaayegaa
 The same claim was made by the government that the dense forests of Chhattisgarh or the remote mountains of Assam or the sandy areas of Rajasthan
 ab har hindustani kii bhukh mitaane ke liye gehun or chaaval godaamon main bhare jaaenge
 But Aaj Tak has brought out the ground truth of this year's biggest promise
 sawaal uthta he ki
 
 
 # Are the poor really getting wheat for 2 rupees? # Is the three-rupee rice going to their stomach? # Are the ration shops eating up their hunger? # Are wheat from the godowns reaching the poor? These questions There is absolutely no need to visit any remote area of the country to know the answer of
 zyada dur kya janaa jis sansad se elaan hua he usee sansad se paanch kilometre dur dilli ke mayapuri main kanoon kii dhajjiyaan udati dikh rahi he
 FCI also has the largest warehouse of Food Corporation of India in Mayapuri
 mayapuri kaa godaam epasiai ke sabase bade godaamon se ek he
 Everyday, countless truckloads of food grains go to the ration shops and then from there, wheat and rice reaches the poor for Rs 2 and Rs 3
 lekin sach to aap bhi jaan hi gaye hai
 Aaj Tak's Operation Black has opened the government's billions of rupees plan
 afasaron or vyapaariyon ke bhrashtachar kii har ghinauni tasviir ujagar ho gai he
 Operation Black has revealed how the country's poor are playing with the poor
 sava arab logon ke is desh main koi bhookha naa rahe, isliye sarkaar ne sava arab karod rupee kii skim banaayi
 It also became law in Parliament
 lekin sansad se chand kilometre dur is kanoon kii dhajjiyaan ud gayi
 Yes, under the government's nose, the ration of the poor is being blackened in public and that too at seven times the price
 dilli ke mayapuri ilaake main epasiai kaa sabase bada godaam he
 Wheat of ration distributed by the Delhi government to the poor is kept in this warehouse
 dilli main is gehun ke rakhwale hai khaaddh evam aapurti mantri harun yusuf or is gehun ko garibon tak pahunchane kaa kaam yusuf sahab ke adhikari or karmchaaree dekhte hai
 There is also a large team of Enforcement for monitoring that thousands of tonnes of wheat of the poor should not reach the brokers instead of the poor
 intjaam pakke hai ki ek rupee kii bhi beimaani na ho, lekin kanoon daal-daal to chor paat-paat kii kahani yahaan charitaarth hoti he
 By quoting sources, Aaj Tak found that thousands of tonnes of wheat from the poor are not going to the ration shop from Mayapuri's government warehouse and going to the big flour mills of Delhi
 karodon rupee ke is khel main police, adhikari or vyapaaree mili hue hai
 To investigate this, Aaj Tak chased ration trucks coming out of the Mayapuri godown
 epasiai ke godaam se niklaa trek number DL 1M 1475 sarkari rashan kii dukaan ke liye ravaanaa hua, lekin bich raste main hi trek ne apana rasta badal diya
 From west Delhi's Shakti Nagar area, the truck turned towards Lawrence Road
 wo laurence road jahaan desh kii badi aataa milen hai
 The truck stopped near a large flour mill in Lawrence Road and started unloading wheat sacks
 jo gehun kii boriyaan garibon ke liye rashan kii dukaan par jaani thim wo rashan kii boriyaan golden floor mil main chali gayi
 Another truck ditching the country's government ration system came out of DL 1GB 4035 FCI warehouse, but this truck also shifted its floor in the middle and reached the same private floor mill
 epasiai se nikalne vaale ek or trek DL 1G b 3953 ne bhi apana rasta bich raste main badal diya or sidhe laurence road jaakar ruk gaya
 On government papers, all these trucks were supposed to feed the poor, but the truth is that these trucks have also come out of the government warehouse to cut the stomach of the poor
 ek or sharmnaak tasviir yah bhi he ki garibon kaa gehun sadakon par blike ho rahaa he
 2 rupees wheat of the poor is going black on the road for 12 rupees and going to private mills
 aaj tak kii padtaal ho hi rahi thi ki trek ke maalik sharma ji ghabaraate hue maukey par pahunch gayi
 Sharma ji does the transport work and most of the fci's warehouse goes to the ration shops for wheat: these trucks have KTC written on them, which is the code word for the PDS wheat supply
 zyaadaatar trek main sharma ji ke hi chalate hai or inke trek raste main kahin pakade na jaae iske liye inhone trek par ek pahchaan bana di he
 All trucks run under the name of KTC and this is their identity
 sharmaji kaa ye code itnaa asardaar he ki inke trakon ko police bhi haath nahin laga sakati
 Sharma also has no fear of the police
 sharma ji ne bataaya ki milon main jane se pehle boriyon par lagi sarkari muhar hataa di jaati he
 Sharma ji did not stop here, he told in talks that without the wheat of ration no flour mill could run for long
 trek number-hr 55 e 1145 ye trek bhi epasiai ke mayapuri godaam se niklaa or pahunch gaya sidhe larens road kii ek or floor mil main
 This mill is named Elephant Brand Floor Mill
 hathi floor mil main pahunche sabhi boron par peedies kii muhar lagi hui he
 And this wheat was also to go to the government ration shop, but openly the wheat of the poor got down in the flour mill
 sansad main saste rashan ke liye aitihaasik kanoon banaaya ja rahaa he or sansad se kuch mile dur par isi kanoon kii khuleam dhajjiyaan udayi ja rahi hai
 The camera shows the truth and the secret camera is the most bitter truth

 ) Anna Hazare's movement against corruption has started recently, but history is witness that this problem is not new and many rulers like Chhatrapati Shivaji had taken a strong stand on this issue earlier
 anil madhav dave ne apni pustak ‘shivaji and suraaj’ main likhaa he, ‘maharaj ko raaj vyavhaar main bhrashtachar, chaahe vah aacharan main ho yaa arthtantr main, bilkul asweekaarya tha
 His step-uncle Mohite received a bribe, Maharaj immediately came to know about this information and put him in jail and sent him to Father Shah ji when he was released
 'beete dinon relies hui pustak ke anusaar, ‘isi prakaar ek dabang ne garib kisaan kii bhoomi hadapney kii koshish kii
 Shivaji not only punished that big farmer who misused his position and power, but also got the land of the poor safe
 ’apane adhikariyon ko likhe 13 may 1671 ke ek patr main shivaji likhte hai, ‘agar aap janata ko takalif denge or kaary sampadan hetu rishwat maangenge to logon ko lagegaa ki isse to mughalon kaa shashan hi acha tha or log pareshaani kaa anubhav karenge
 'rajya Sabha member Dave said,' Chhatrapati Shivaji was strongly against corruption
 isamen keval aarthik nahin, balki charitrik or prashasnic bhrashtachar bhi shaamil tha
 His definition of corruption was very broad, which is being supported by devout citizens all over the country
 ’portugal ke vysarai kol de saint vincent ne 20 sitambar 1667 ke patr main likhaa he, ‘dhoortta, saahas, sanchaalan or sainya sooyeeboojh main shivaji kii tulana sijar evam alexander se kii ja sakati he
 In the book, Dave wrote, 'shivaji knew that corruption is poisonous in a way and adversaries make full use of this route to serve their interests
 rajmahal main send evam rajyakartaaon kaa vyabhichaar ant main rajya kii paraajay kaa kaaran banataa he
 Therefore, he was extremely strict towards such corruption

 He was the ruler

 While doing this, he made full use of material, price, punishment, distinction
 unhone vijay prapti hetu dushmano ko jahaan aavashyak laga, sabhi prakaar ke pralobhan die lekin swayan ko nari evam kisi bhi prakaar ke pralobhan se na keval mukt rakhaa balki apane sahyogi ko bhi aisa nahin karne diya

 The reform movement of Glasnaut or Perestroika, or the freedom struggle of America, started by Mikhail Gorbachov in Russia, are just manifestations of the swirling 'self' in all society, born from a hero or without a hero
 ’mughal darbar ke itihaaskaar gaphi khan jaisaa unka virdohi bhi likhata he, ‘shivaji apni praja main maan maryaada banaae rakhane ke liye hameshaa saavdhaan rahe
