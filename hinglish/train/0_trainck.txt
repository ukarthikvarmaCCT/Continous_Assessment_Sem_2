 There was a protest

 Claims were made to change everything

 The situation is still the same
 agar aisa nahin hota todillika wo parivaar is vakt apni takadir par ro nahin rahaa hota
 You would be surprised to know that even an innocent person was much younger than Nirbhaya
 balki choti kya thi abhi is duniya main aae hue use mahaz teen saal hi hue the
 But at a young age, she was hunted by a pauper and tortured her
 sahi kahen to nirbhaya cond kii barsi par dilli phir sharmasaar ho gai
 This time a 3-year-old was raped
 padosi ne hi mauka paakar kii bacchee se zyaadati kii
 Incidentally, people caught the culprit red-handed and handed him over to the police
 maamla dilli ke bindapur kaa he
 a person living in the same neighborhood with a three-year-old little girl was tortured
 repakia
 When the baby bled and started to get badly, other neighbors suspected something
 jab wo uske makaan main pahunche, to aaropee maukey par hi pakadaa gaya
 Then the people around him taught him such a lesson
 asal main is bacchee ke mata-pita kaam-kaaj ke silsile main ghar se baahar gaye the
 And this girl was present at home with her elder sister
 is dauraan security guard kii naukari karnaa vaala ranjit kumaar unke ghar pahunchaa or bacchee ko agava kar liya
 He came to his room with the girl
 phir phool si najuk bacchee ke saath balaatkaar jaisi ghinauni vaardaat ko anjaam diya
 Ranjit lives in the upper floor of this girl's house
 maamla apane-aap main behad sangeen he, upar se ittefaq ye he ki ye vakya bhi usee rose hua, jab desh nirbhaya cond jaisi jaghanya vaardaat kii chhathi barsi manaa rahaa tha
 In such a situation, it was bound to take hold of the matter
 lihaaza
 
 dilli mahila ayog kii chairman swati maliwal ne is maamle ko uthaaya or ek baar phir pradhanmantri se aise maamalon ko mudda banane kii baat kahi
 However, in this case, the culprit was caught with the help of people
 lekin shaayad lakh koshishon ke baavjood kaanoon main wo sakhti nahin ai, jisase gunahagaaron main khoff hota
 Well, it is not difficult to understand this matter
 haqiqat yahi he ki ab itane saal baad bhi nirbhaya ke gunaahagaaron ke gale faansee ke fande tak nahin pahunche he
 i wish, change the situation, wish girls were safe

 During an interview recently, Kat spoke openly about the role in the film Tiger
 katrina film main apane damdaar role or mil rahi tarifon se kaaphi khush hai
 He believes that to show his ability and presence, you do not necessarily do a movie with a solo lead role
 sabase jaruri he aap film main apane role main behatar karen
 Katrina's action scene is getting much praise despite Salman Khan's reign in Katrinaatigar Zinda Hai celebrating Tiger and New Year in this way
 lekin solo lead role kii baat karte hue cat kaa ishaara sidhaa kangana ranut or vidya baalan kii ore he
 Let me tell you that for a long time, Bollywood's best actress Kangana and Vidya Solo have been creating new definitions by playing lead roles on their own
 samandar kinare cat ne manaaya nayaa salkatrina ke liye beetaa saal kaaphi acha rahaa he
 Recently he celebrated Christmas with his family
 katrina ne kuch din pehle apni nani ke saath tasviir share kii thi
 Katrina's mother Suzanne is a British lawyer and charity worker

 He said that the country's political-bureaucratic-judicial system needs urgent 'chemotherapy' so that it can come out of the "cancer-like situation" that is swallowing the country

 The country really needs chemotherapy at this time

 That should be our feeling

 bangladeshke 23 varshiya ballebasmominul hakane abhi mahaj 13 test khele hai or unka ausat isaki 24 pariyon main 63
 90's
 test cricketke itihaas main 20 pariyon ke baad is ballebaaj kaa ausat sardon breadmanke baad duusare sthaan par he
 The special thing is that in only one of these 13 Tests he has not scored a half-century, that is, he has scored a half-century or a century in the remaining 12 Tests
 ab tak chaar shatak or aath ardhashatak jamaa chuke mominul haq ne 80 ranon kii apni is pari ke saath hi lagaataar 10 test maichon main ardhashatak lagane kaa karnama kar sachin tendulkar or jon adrich ke record kii barabari kar lee he
 Now ahead of them are Sir Vivian Richards, Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir, who have scored half-centuries in 11 consecutive matches, and South African captain AB de Villiers, who has scored half-centuries in 12 consecutive Tests
 yani agle do test main ardhashatak lagaate hi yah record unke naam ho jayega
 If we talk about the record of half-centuries in consecutive Test matches since debut, then it still remains in the name of Mark Taylor and Sunil Gavaskar
 inhone lagaataar 13 test maichon main ardhashatak lagane ke karnama kar rakhaa he
 While Mominul has done this feat in 12 of the 13 Test matches played
 isse pehle bhi mominul sar don breadman ke baad sabase tej hajaar ran banane vaale test cricketer banane kaa karnama kar chuke hai
 His one thousand runs were scored in less than 20 Test innings
 2013 main apane test kariyar kii shuruyaat karne vaale mominul haq ab tak 1,278 ran bana chuke hai
 His four centuries have been against New Zealand, Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe
 unhone apane chauthe test main hi 181 ranon kii badi test pari kheli thi
 Mominul Haque is the 12th Test cricketer from Bangladesh to score more than a thousand runs
 bangladesh kii ore se unase zyada test shatak keval tamim ikbaal or mohammad ashraful ne lagaae hai
 Both of them have six centuries in Test cricket
 bangladesh cricket lagaataar utthan par he
 Bangladesh cricket team, which is consistently doing well in ODI cricket, has recently beaten a strong team like Pakistan not only in odis but also in T20 matches
 ab yah team test match main pakistan se muqabla kar rahi he
 The team, which has lost eight consecutive Tests to Pakistan, looks forward to victory for the first time and Mominul Haque has become the reason for this hope
 mominul ne team ke score ko 332 ranon tak le jane main badi bhoomika nibhaai he
 Bangladesh batsmen, the newest team of Test matches, are leaving their mark due to performance on the cricket pitch and it is very possible that Mominul's innings will help Bangladesh win their eighth international Test match
 agar aisa hua to yah pakistan ke khilaaf pehali or zimbabwe, westeindies ke baad kisi teesri test khilne vaali team par uski pehali jeet hogi

 After leaving abroad on August 11, he escaped the trouble that his land deals created for the Congress, as the BJP had decided to create a ruckus in Parliament on the issue
 wadra ke jameen saudon par pehle bhi sawaal uthaae gaye hai
 This time the issue got heated up by a 105-page note by IAS officer Ashok Khemka
 isamen unhone priyanka gandhi ke pati par aarope lagaaya he ki unhone gudgaanv ke shikohpur gaanv main 3
 Used fake documents for 'suspicious deals' of 5 acres of valuable land
 land records ke mahanideshak khemka ne aktubar 2012 main is saude par aapatti kii thi or wadra evam realty diggaj dlef universal li
 The transfer of land between them was repealed
 iske baad unka fouran transfar kar diya gaya tha
 But in April, an investigation conducted by the Congress government of Haryana gave Vadra a clean chit
 is jaanch report main kaha gaya ki khemka ne bhoomi hastantaran ko nirast karke apane adhikaar kshetra se baahar jaakar kaam kiya he
 But Khemka, who has faced transfer 44 times in the last 22 years, was not disturbed and in response, he prepared a detailed note and submitted it to the Haryana government on 21 May
 isamen unhone bahut vistaar se yah bataaya he ki kis prakaar haryana sarkaar ke toun and country planning vibhaag (ditisipi) ne niyam-kaayadon kii avalena kar ''poonjivadi giroh ko bichauliyon kii tarah kaam karne diya taaki ve commercial colony ke liye hasil license par munafa kamaayen or malai katate rahen
 In October 2012, Khemka was silenced
 iske pehle ki ve shikohpur jameen saude main aniyamitata kaa puri tarah se khulaasa karte, rajya sarkaar ne unka transfar kar diya
 But this time he put everything in writing and Vadra's Skylight Hospitality Pvt
 kii ore se kiye gaye saude ke har kadam par kiye gaye ghapalon ko ujagar kar diya (box dekhen)
 Among these, 7 of Corporation Bank
 5 karod ru
 There was also talk of 'no existence' of the overdraft which the company has shown in its 2008-09 book
 iees adhikari ne yah bhi ullekh kiya he ki kis tarah se ek commercial colony viksit karne kaa license wadra kii company ko de diya gaya, lekin usne ise baari munaafe ke saath dlef ko bech diya jo niyam-kaayadon ke puri tarah khilaaf he
 This time the BJP has decided to raise the issue in Parliament
 usne pehle kii us hichkichaahat ko chhod diya he jo sambhavat: is niti par aadhaarit thi ki ''netaaon ke bacchon or rishtedaaron par vyaktigat taur par hamalaa nahin kiya jayega
 "there was a fear that this could happen to BJP leaders tomorrow
 lekin aktubar 2012 kii niti se yah antar asal main arvind kejariwal kii aam aadmi party dwaara bijepi kaa majaak udaane or aresas kii jhidki kaa nateeja he
 This time the BJP took up the issue and after discussions between senior leaders like party president Rajnath Singh, Leader of Opposition Sushma Swaraj, Arun Jaitley, Yashwant Sinha, LK Advani, it was decided that this The party will surround the Congress on the issue
 party main yah raay bani ki bhrashtachar ke mudde par sonia gandhi ko lakshya kar kiye gaye hamale se party ko 2014 ke chunaavon main phayda milegaa
 Aggressively attacked in both houses of Parliament on 13 August
 pehali baar bhrashtachar ke aarope sonia gandhi ke daaman tak pahunch gaye
 In the Lok Sabha, BJP mps raised slogans like 'congress ka haath, son-in-law'
 unhone maang kii ki supreme court kii nigaraanee main vishesh jaanch dal (esaity) se maamle kii jaanch karai jaani chahie
 Yashwant Sinha, who led this aggressive approach in the Lok Sabha, while leaving the arrow of satire, urged the Congress to start the Vadra School of Management where their 'unique business model' is to be studied — how to make crores of rupees without investing your money Go
 unhone vitt mantri pi
 He told Chidambaram why he does not use this model to "reinvigorate the Indian economy and prevent the rupee depreciation
" ”is hamale se congress ko apana bachaav karne main kaaphi mushkil ho rahi thi
 Several arguments were made in the defense, such as, "they are not public servants, so their activities cannot be discussed in Parliament" or "the issue is related to the Haryana government
" ” sonia chuppi sadhakar baithi raheen, is ummid main ki ho-hallaa shant ho jayega or khaadya suraksha bill par charchaa shuru ho paaegi
 This is a very sensitive issue for Congressmen
 koi bhi sonia gandhi ke saath isaki charchaa nahin karnaa chahta
 Says a senior Congress leader, "whenever an important issue comes up in Parliament, Congress leaders usually discuss it with the Speaker
" lekin yah aisa mudda he jise unke saamne koi nahin uthaanaa chahta
 “congress managers have to devise themselves to tackle this crisis
 sabase pehle is mudde par 11 agast ko haryana sarkaar ne pratikriya di
 This was done without telling the media department of the Congress in Delhi
 haryana ke mantri randeep singh surajevaala ne khemka ke daavon ko khaarij karte hue tivi par kaha, ''yah nihit swaarthee tatwon kii ore se aaropon or sansani kaa ek besura raag he
 "at first the Congressmen were assuming that this response on this issue is sufficient
 lekin jab bijepi ne yah dhamkee di ki vah is mudde ko sansad main uthaaegi to congress ke media manageron ko apni ranneeti par punarvichaar karnaa padaa
 When the party's dialogue head Ajay Maken took charge outside the Parliament, the task of tackling the opposition in Parliament was given to Parliamentary Affairs Minister Kamal Nath
 ve sushamaa swaraj or jetali ke niyamit sampark main rahe, lekin donon main se kisi ne unhen koi aashwaasan nahin diya
 The BJP had not finalized its strategy till then
 congress kii pareshaani ko or badhaate hue gudgaanv se congressi saansad raav inderjeet singh ne khemka kaa bachaav karte hue 2005 se apane sansadeey kshetra main hue sabhi jameen saudon ke jaanch kii maang kar di
 The Congress has been in power in Haryana since 2005
 unhone india today ko bataaya, ''aisi dharna ban gai he ki pichley aath varshon main jameen ke bade-bade plot kaa land yuj kheti se badalakar commercial yaa 'anya istemaal’ ke liye kar diya gaya he
 The perception is that some veterans from across the country associated with many political parties have been involved in making money by selling licenses to various builders
 in sabaki puri tarah se jaanch honi chahie
 i am not saying that one should be behind the case
 ” naaraaz congress ne inderjeet singh kii tippanee par tatkaal to kuch nahin kiya, lekin jaldi hi uske prachaar tantra ne apana kaam shuru kar diya
 Significantly, Gadgaon mp's relationship with Haryana Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda is not good
 12 agast ko dopaher baad kareeb 3 baje maakan ne party pravaktaa renuka choudhary ko bulaayaa or unase kaha ki isi line par chalaa jaae ki ''wadra indiviual hai
 "when such an issue came up earlier in October 2012, Renuka defended Vadra loudly
 iske baad anya pravaktaaon ko bhi nirdesh die gaye: is mudde par jitna sambhav ho, kam bolen or is line ko follow karen ki ''wadra ek indiviual hai” yaa ''iske bare main haryana sarkaar se puuchhen
 "this was later clarified by the statement of party spokesperson Sandeep Dixit on 13 August
 unhone media brifing main saaf taur par kaha ki is mudde par sansad main bahes nahin kii ja sakati or bijepi iske bare main haryana sarkaar se sawaal karne ko swatantra he yaa vah chaahe to wadra ke bare main sawaalon or shikayaton ke saath adaalat kaa darwaja khatkhata sakati he
 The party spokesperson may have removed Sonia Gandhi from the center of controversies at the moment by turning the media's questions to the Haryana government, but many senior party leaders say that Vadra has now become a major embarrassment for the party
 rajasthan ke ek congress netaa kehete hai, ''koi nahin jaanata ki kab unke naam se koi or scandle saamne aa jaae
 Vadra has also bought plots in Rajasthan
 jab bhi wadra ke sandigdh jameen saudon kaa mudda saamne aata he, sonia baichaiyn ho jaati hai
 So far, he has kept silent on this issue, while the enthusiastic leaders of the party immediately come out in defense of Vadra
 yah to saaf he ki unhone apane damaad ke maamalon se khud ko dur rakhaa he
 This time Priyanka is also silent, while last February when Priyanka defended Vadra when her political ambitions were revealed during the assembly election campaign in Amethi
 congress ke netaaon ko ummid he ki swatantraaa diwas ke baad yah mudda apane aap khatm ho jayega kyonki sansad main 15 se 18 agast ke bich koi kaamkaaj nahin hoga
 a senior Congress leader jokingly says, "maybe we can get rid of Vadra's issue by the end of the week and from August 19, Parliament can function smoothly
" ” lekin yah to is baat par nirbhar hoga ki jab vipakshi dal ke saansad sansad lautenge to unka mood kaisaa hoga
 —with Kumar Anshuman mumbai main ek peechha karne vaale vyakti ne bollywood abhinetri shruti hasan ke ghar main ghus kar hamalaa kiya

com, a website, the 27-year-old actress opened her door as soon as a man grabbed Shruti's throat and attempted to enter the house
 shruti ne aise maukey par bahaduree kaa parichay diya or darwaja hamalavar ke haath par de maaraa

 savitribai phule rachana samgr kii sampadak rajani tilak hai
 The translator is Shekhar Pawar
 kitaab kii keemat 160 rupye he
 The publisher is Marginalized Publications
 savitribai phule rachana samgr main savitribai (1831-1897) kii kavitaayen, patr or bhaashan shaamil hai, jo jati-pratha, andhvishwaas, or samaaj main mahila kii gulaami ke khilaaf tagada virodh darj karaate hai
 This book is actually a Hindi translation of the Marathi work on Phule
 ummid he ki yah hindipattee ko savitribai ke vichaaron se avgat karaane main madadgaar sabit hogi
 He married Jyotiba Phule (1827–1890), a Mali (shudra), who led an anti-caste war in modern India
 aage chalakar babasaheb ambedkar (1891-1956) ne isi ladaai ko aage badhaayaa
 The Phule couple voiced their entire life against caste system, untouchability, superstition, exploitation of laborers and Shudras and the plight of women
 savitribai isamen baraabar kii bhagidaar raheen
 To end exploitation from society, when Karl Maxr was busy writing the Communist Manifesto in Europe, the Phule couple were creating an exploitation-free society in India through the education of women
 unhone shudra or ati-shudra ladakiyon ke liye skool kholaa
 It was a revolutionary move for lower caste people who had been deprived of education for centuries
 aage chalakar aise skool anya jatiyon kii mahilaon or shramik varg ke liye bhi khole gaye
 Due to working in the field of education of Shudras, ati-shudras and women, the couple faced tremendous opposition from reactionary Brahmins
 jaanaleva hamalaa tak hua
 But this fierceness exacerbated their azam
 dhire-dhire bahut-se logon ne soch badali or unhone betiyon ko unke skool bhejnaa shuru kiya
 The essence is that near Savitribai, the path of education leads to women's liberation
 yah baat unki rachana main maujuud he
 For example, in the music drama poem, Savitribai says: "to live with self-respect, daughters should read and write, read a lot / go to school everyday and increase your knowledge / The true jewelery of every human being is education
 har stri ko shiksha kaa gahanaa pahananaa he
 
 
 (P
 74)
 In addition to education, she also worked for widow-raising and remarriage
 unhone kashibai naamak brahman vidhwaa se hue bachche ko god lekar padhaayaa-likhaaya, doctor banaaya or baad main uskaa antar-jaateey vivaah bhi karavaaya
 Such revolutionary work 150 years ago today! While our society is still struggling with women oppression, dowry and caste
 inhen vajahon se savitribai kii rachana hamaare liye kaaphi aham ho jaati he
 It is expected that Hindi readers will read this book and be apprehensive about Savitribai's idea and will contribute to their unfulfilled dreams

 The source said, "the meeting can be either in the auditorium or in the Chief Minister's office
 hamane yah sandesh junior doctoron tak pahunchaa diya he
 Banerjee invited the protesters to a closed-door meeting, but she turned down his offer
 apane sanchaalan mandal kii dhai ghante chali baithak ke baad junior doctoron ke sanyukt morcha ke pravaktaa ne media se kaha, ‘‘ham log is gatirodh ko dur karne ke icchhuk hai

 ''pravaktaa ne kaha ki rajya ke sabhi medical college evam aspataalon se pratinidhi baithak main shaamil ho saken, iske liye baithak sthal par paryaapt jagah honi chahie
 Earlier, the protesters insisted that the Chief Minister visit the NRS Medical College and Hospital
 unhone kaha, ‘‘aam janata ke hit ke liye ham log bhi jald se jald duty par lautnaa chaahate hai basharte paryaapt evam tarkpurna charchaa ke madhyam se hamaari sabhi maangon ko puraa kiya jaye
 The spokesperson said, "we hope that the Chief Minister will come up with an idea to solve the problems

 - Input IANS cheharaa dhonaa shaayad sabase aasaan kaam he
 But do you know how dangerous the way you wash your face can prove to be
 ham cheharaa dhote samay aksar aisi galtiyaan karte rahete hai jisase cheharaa saaf hone ke bajaay bejaan hota jaataa he
 Here are some similar mistakes that we all usually make: 1
 cheharaa dhone kaa pani na to bahut garm hona chahie or na hi bahut thanda
 Too much cold and too much hot water can damage the face
 aise main halke gunagune pani se hi cheharaa saaf karnaa chahie
 2
 agar aapcheharaa saaf karne ke liye scrubar kaa istemaal karti hanto is baat kaa dhyaan rakhen ki komal haathon se hi scrubing karen
 Otherwise, rub marks may also form on the face
 3
 If you have to remove makeup, instead of washing face first of all, wipe it with cotton
 uske baad hi chehre ko pani se saaf kiijie
 Washing the makeup directly with water makes the particles of makeup go into the pores of the skin, which causes them to stop
 4
 If you are going to wash your face, clean your hands first
 gande haathon se cheharaa saaf karne kaa koi phayda nahin he
 5
 chehre ko bahut adhik dhonaa bhi sahi nahin he
 Frequent washing of the face reduces facial beauty
 6
 After washing the face it should be wiped with light hands
 chehre ko ragadkar pochhna bilkul bhi thik nahin he
 7
 chehre ko sabun se to bilkul bhi nahin dhoen
 If your face wash is over, you can use gram flour instead of any chemical substance

 aspataal ke prabandhak santosh kumaar kehete hai ki jaraa si barish ho jaae to baahar ke puure ilaake main baadh aa jaati he
 For many years and months, the administration has been writing about this, but no one knows where the letters went

 There are not even 20 beds in two rooms named after the beds
 aspataal kaa galiyara jo aamtaur par aane-jane ke kaam main istemaal hota he vah bhi immergency ward main badal chukaa he

 Team India captain Virat Kohli, who led Yazvendra Chahal and Parvez Rasool in the IPL (indian Premier League), said that these two spinners have the shortest format specialist bowler in the three T20 matches series against England starting on Thursday
 There will be a golden opportunity to be made
 aswin, jadeja ko diya gaya aramravichandran aswin or ravindra jadeja ko tii20 siries se aaraam diya gaya he or isliye spin vibhaag kii jimmedaari chahal or rasul jaise yuva gendbaajon par hogi
 Kohli said that these bowlers have good experience of playing in IPL which will also work here
 IPL, gharelu T20 ke aadhaar par team main shamilkohli ne match kii purv sandhya par kaha, ‘jin khilaadiyon ko team main liya gaya he unhone ipel or gharelu tii20 main acha pradarshan kiya he
 They are economical and bowl in the right area
 unhen abhi tak badi siries main khilne kaa mauka nahin mila or isliye yah unke paas tii20 visheshgy ke rup main apni jagah pakki karne kaa acha mauka hoga
 He said, 'everyone has seen Chahal's performance and Rasul has also played under my captaincy at RCB so i know what kind of bowling he does
 ’kohli ne rasul, chahal kii jam kar kii tarifkohli ne kaha, ‘vah (rasul) aatmavishvaas se bharaa he
 He can bowl with the new ball even in front of the world's most aggressive batsman
 ye donon (rasul or chahal) bahut samajhadaari se gendbaaji karte hai
 They can create pressure by putting some balls blank and that gives you wickets
 yah in donon ke liye bahut hi mahatvapurn siries he or unke paas tii20 export ke rup main bhartiya team main jagah banane kaa yah sunaharaa mauka he
 He said, "this series is a great chance for many players to return to form again or to ensure their place in the team
" isliye har kisi ko is team main shaamil kiya gaya he kyonki hamen un par vishwaas he, hamen un par bharosa he
 They can also contribute in the future
 aakhir main yah ek khilaadi par nirbhar karata he ki vah kitna taiyaar he or vah maukey kaa phayda uthaane ke liye kitna betaab he
 "looking for the best team combination, Kohli also clarified that there is no possibility of much change in team combination and added that he can also start the innings as he has done for the RCB in the IPL
" 
 unhone kaha, ‘abhi yah (combination taiyaar karnaa) aasaan he
 The problem comes when there is lack of continuity
 ham kuch maichon ke baad hi sarvshereshth combination kaa pataa kar paaenge
 In the first match you will have a fixed line up but if there is a continuity issue in the batting order then it is difficult whether you want to keep that player in the team or not
 ’opening kar sakate hai captain kohliaagaj karne ke bare main kaha, ‘sabhi tarah kii sambhaavnaaen hai
 In the IPL you do not have many Indian batsmen as they are associated with many franchise teams
 jahaan tak bhartiya ballebaajon kaa sawaal he to yahaan aapke paas kaaphi vikalp hote he
 If needed, i can begin the innings
 yah team ke santulan par nirbhar karata he
 i have only started one or two T20 innings but i have the experience of opening in the IPL
 jarurat padane par main aisa kar bhi saktaa hum or nahin bhi

 shanivaar ko adaalat ke sawaal karne ke baad se hi dilli kii aap sarkaar or police ke bich khinchataan chal rahi he
 In fact, according to Delhi government sources, the court has set rules to approve prosecution and they will be followed
 sutara ne bataaya, ‘niyamanusaar sarkaar ko manjuuri dene ke liye teen maheene kaa vakt miltaa he
 It took three years for the Delhi Police to file the chargesheet
 sarkaar ko faisla lene se pehle kanoonee salaah lene kii anumati di jaani chahie
 'he said, but if the government is not able to take a decision in three months, then it will be considered as sanction for the case

 For the remaining period of the current financial year, an additional amount of Rs 3,000 crore and Rs 9,000 crore will have to be provided on an annual basis

 While in 2018, 2

 1 of which
 65 lakh ummidavaaron ne is pariksha ke liye registration kiya tha
 According to this data, students have not shown interest in the JEE Advanced exam for the second consecutive year
 aapako bataa den, iaiti main daakhile ke liye jeii advance pariksha kaa doosraa charan he
 Because on the basis of JEE Main score (conducted by National Testing Agency), only a few selected students get the chance to take this exam
 jeii advance pariksha main chaatr kyon nahin kar rahe registrationindian express kii report ke anusaar IIT kanpur ke purv nideshak, IIT kanpur, IIITM gwalior ke pramukh, bhartiya ejeeniyar or shikshavid sanjay govind dhande se baat karte hue bataaya ki ejineering ke liye iaiti chaatr or abhibhavakon kii pehali pasand he

 Sanjay Govind Dhande further said that there is pressure on students to take the JEE Main exam as it can open many doors for them
 par zyaadaatar chaatr beatech kii degree ke liye is pariksha kaa chayan nahin karte hai
 They often opt for JEE Main to be more creative than analytics-based subjects, which may include programs designed by iiits based on JEE Main scores

" unhone bataaya ki unka pasandida vishay physics he
 He wants to study theological physics further

 Jagdish Kumar, Dean of Academic Courses said that IIT Madras is currently the top-ranked IIT, but students can leave iits and prefer institutions like nits in the surrounding areas
 vahiin unhone kaha “yadi kisi chaatr ne jeii main pariksha main 2000 rank hasil kii he, to use jo bhi program chahie vah enaiti main milegaa, lekin yadi ve jeii advance main upasthit hote hai or clear karte hai, to unhen apni pasand ke iaiti main apana pasandida course milane main pareshaani ho sakati he

 SAARC Summit concluded in Kathmandu The South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) two-day summit of Heads of Governments of the eight countries of South Asia concluded in Kathmandu
 aisa kabhi hua to nahin tha lekin jo hua use hote dekh bharat hi nahin duniya bhar main bhartiya tivi or internet se chipke rahe ki aakhir supreme court kya faisla detii he
 Both adversaries and advocates of the execution of the sentence remained awake as to what the court pronounced
 zaahir si baat he ki unki haalia smriti main aisi koi ghatana hui bhi nahin thi ki raashtrapati ke dayaa yachika khaarij karne ke baad aadhi raat ko prashanth bhushan, anand grover, vrinda grover, yugamohit choudhary jaise vakil vahaan se bharat ke pradhan nyaayadhish justise ech

 Many said that this never happened
 apane aap main puri prakriya gaurav kaa lamhaa main badal gai
 But there is another incident that can be missed in this context
 nithari hatyakand ke mujrim surendra coli ko meerut kii jail main faansee honi thi
 You know how the whole society was shaken when the secret of Nithari murder was revealed in 2006
 surendra coli kaa zikr aate hi kis tarah log rosh se bhar jate the
 Surendra Koli was to be hanged in Meerut jail on the morning of 8 September

 Even at that hour of night, the Chief Justice banned the hanging

 Later the Allahabad High Court converted the hanging of Surendra Koli to life imprisonment
 to indira jaisingh jaise vakil sirf yaqub memon ke liye hi nahin balki surendra coli jaison ke liye bhi jaagate hai
 Many people have asked whether these people will go for any poor night
 sahi sawaal he lekin kya yahi sawaal un vakeelon se kiya jayega jo party main pravaktaa, mantri banate hai or sanvaidhanik pad hasil karte hai
 It should be known that how many such lawyers fought the case of the poor and how many corporate
 vrinda grover or prashanth bhushan jaise vakil gujarat dangon main darjanon logon kii hatya kii aaropee purv mantri maaya kodenani ko faansee dene kii baat kaa bhi virodh karte hai
 In 2012, 14 retired judges of the Supreme Court and the High Court wrote to President Pranab Mukherjee that the death sentence of 9 people in five cases should be commuted to life imprisonment
 zaahir he kamazor ke liye pehle bhi ladaa jaataa rahaa he
 It is completely wrong to say that there is a protest against the hanging
 faansee kaa virodh hona he to yah jimmaa do chaar vakeelon ke kandhe par kyon hai
 Why don't political parties clear their line
 kya hamaari raajnneeti tathakthith samuhik chetana se ghabraati he
 We should understand that the leaders and parties are under pressure and fear of strong public opinion, perhaps even Shashi Tharoor may have stayed but his tweet right after hanging is no less adventurous
 shashi tharur ne kaha ki 'dukhi hum ki hamaari sarkaar ne ek insaan ko lataka diya he
 State sponsored murder turns all of us into murderers too
 main kisi cese kii merit par tippanee nahin kar rahaa hum, use supreme court ko tay karnaa he
 The problem is with the hanging

 isamen badlaav kii koi baat party nahin kar sakati
 If the whole parliament wants it can consider it
 jab tak ye dand vidhaan kaa hissaa he iskaa puri tarah se anupaalan hona chahie
 So the Congress will express its opinion only when the Parliament gives its opinion
 aap bataaiye ki bina partiyon kii raay ke kya sansad apni raay pehle bataa sakati he
 Was his compulsion to distance himself from Shashi Tharoor's statement because of that so-called collective consciousness
 is samuhik chetana ko bhi thik se samajhnaa chahie
 It is true that the number of those who supported the hanging is not small, but it is also true that by taking advantage of them, those who spread the hysteria are not less
 meri raay main teen tarah kaa tabaka faansee kii sazaa ke samarthan main sakriy he
 One section has been a supporter of the execution of the sentence, while there has been a section which is opposed to the hanging but there is support for hanging in cases like terrorism
 in donon tabake kaa laabh ek tisare tabake ne uthaaya
 People in this section have started making space for their politics under the pretext of hanging supporters, many parties and people of both communities doing so
 jab afzal guru ko faansee hui thi tab sipiem ke mukhpatr pipuls demokrasi ne likhaa tha ki afazal kii faansee se kashmir main algaavvaad or badhegaa
 Whereas Sitaram Yechury said that the law did its job
 jo maamla 11 saal se atka tha uskaa ant hua
 In a way it was an honor and a welcome, but this time the CPM was speaking against the execution from the beginning
 seetaram yechuri ne kaha ki hamaari party maanati he ki faansee kii sazaa nahin honi chahie

 The proposal did not pass there, but when there was protest against the hanging of Rajoana in Punjab, the collective consciousness went to Shimla from Kalka Mail to celebrate the holiday
 tippaniyan In March 2012, Akali Dal called for a Punjab bandh to protest against the hanging of Balwant Singh Rajoana
 congress ke pradesh adhyaksh captain amarinder singh ne bhi faansee kaa virodh kiya or akali dal ne to kiya hi
 BJP never changed its line but never changed its friend
 bijepi aaj bhi faansee kaa samarthan karti he magar virodh karne vaale ko apni sarkaar main jagah bhi detii he
 In the terrorist attack in which Balwant Singh Rajoana was convicted, 17 people including the Chief Minister were killed
 us vakt rajoana ne ek patr bhi likhaa tha ki mujhe akali dal ke netao se koi madad nahin chahie
 They have done nothing to bring justice to the Sikhs
 itihaas akali dal ko kabhi maaf nahin karegaa
 Nevertheless, the Akali Dal supported and the death sentence was hanged
 aaj ham akali dal, congress, bijepi or sipiem netaaon ke saath hai jinase baat karenge ki kya unamem saahas he ki ve un chand vakeelon kii tarah unmaad kaa shikaar hote hue bhi faansee kaa virodh kar sakate hai

 Reached Dattu's government house
 pradhan nyaayadhish ne bhi saamne ai yachika par vichaar karne kaa faisla kiya or raat ko supreme court khulwaaya gaya
 At 4:58 am, it was decided that there will be a hanging
 kai logon ne kaha ki aisa kabhi nahin hua
 The whole process in itself turned into a moment of pride
 lekin ek or ghatana he jise is sandarbh main yaad kiya ja saktaa he
 The convict Surender Koli of the Nithari murder case was to be hanged in Meerut jail
 aap jaanate hi hai ki 2006 main jab nithari hatyakand kaa raaj saamne aayaa tha tab kaise sara samaaj hill gaya tha
 How come people were filled with anger as soon as Surendra Koli was mentioned
 aath sitambar kii subah meerut kii jail main surendra coli ko faansee di jaani thi
 Renowned lawyer Indira Jaisingh at half past five in the night
 el
 Reached Dattu Saheb's house
 raat kii us ghadi main bhi pradhan nyaayadhish ne faansee par roak laga di
 The media did not know about it till morning
 baad main elahabaad hoicourt ne surendra coli kii faansee ko umr kaid main badal diya
 So lawyers like Indira Jaising awake not just for Yakub Memon but also for Surendra Koli
 kai logon ne poocha he ki ye log kisi garib ke liye kya raat ko jaayenge
 The right question is but will the same question be asked to those lawyers who become spokespersons, ministers and hold constitutional posts in the party
 pataa karnaa chahie ki aise vakeelon ne kitne garibon kaa cese ladaa or kitne karporate kaa
 Advocates like Vrinda Grover and Prashant Bhushan also oppose the hanging of former minister Maya Kodnani, accused of killing dozens of people in the Gujarat riots
 2012 main supreme court or hai court ke 14 ritred jajon ne raashtrapati pranab mukherjee ko likhaa tha ki paanch maamalon main 9 logon kii faansee kii sazaa ko umr kaid main badal diya jaae
 Obviously, the weak have been fought for before
 yah kahana puri tarah se galat he ki faansee kaa virodh abhi ho rahaa he
 If there is a protest against the execution, then why are the responsibilities of two or four lawyers
 raajnneetik dal apni line kyon nahin saaf karte
 Does our politics panic with the so-called collective consciousness
 hamen samajhnaa chahie ki netaaon or dalon par vakti janamat kaa dabaav or bhay hota he, shaayad shashi tharur par bhi rahaa hoga lekin faansee ke baad hi sahi unka twit kam saahasik nahin he
 Shashi Tharoor said that 'I am sad that our government has hanged a human being
 rajya pryojit hatya ham sabko bhi hatyare main badal detii he
 i am not commenting on the merit of a case, it has to be decided by the Supreme Court
 samasya he faansee ko lekar
 We must fight terrorism but this kind of killing has not stopped terrorism anywhere
 ' The Congress could move forward with the line of Shashi Tharoor, but the party knows that the leaders of the Tharoor type do not fit into the politics of collective consciousness
 landan main wo koi baat kah de to pradhanmantri ko bhi janch jaati he magar bharat main hawa ke khilaaf bol den to sab daaen baayen dekhne lagate hai
 Congress Party spokesman Randeep Singh Surjewala said that hanging has been part of the penal law in the country for 67 years
 ye reerest of rer cese main hi di jaati he
 The party cannot talk of any change in it
 agar puri sansad chaahe to is par vichaar kar sakati he
 As long as it is part of the penal legislation, it should be fully compliant
 to congress apni raay tabhi bataaegi jab sansad apni raay bataaegi
 You can tell that without the opinion of the parties, can the Parliament give its opinion first
 shashi tharur ke bayaan se duuri banane kii uski majaburi kya us tathakthith samuhik chetana ke kaaran thi
 This collective consciousness should also be understood properly
 yah sahi he ki faansee kaa samarthan karne waalon kii taadaad kam nahin he lekin yah bhi sahi he ki unka laabh uthaakar unmaad failaane vaale bhi kam nahin hai
 In my opinion, three types of sections are active in support of capital punishment
 ek tabaka faansee kii sazaa kaa samarthak rahaa he to ek aisa tabaka bhi rahaa jiskaa faansee se to virodh he magar aatankwaad jaise maamalon main faansee kaa samarthan he
 a third section took advantage of these two sections
 is tabake main shaamil log faansee ke samarthakon ke bahaane apni raajnneeti ke liye jagah banane lage hai, aisa karne vaale kai dalon main or donon samudaay ke log hai
 When Afzal Guru was hanged, the CPM mouthpiece People's Democracy wrote that Afzal's hanging would increase separatism in Kashmir
 jabaki seetaram yechuri ne kaha tha ki kanoon ne apana kaam kiya
 The case which had been stuck for 11 years came to an end
 ek tarah se yah sammaan or swaagat hi tha lekin is baar sipiem shuru se hi faansee ke khilaaf bol rahi thi
 Sitaram Yechury said that our party believes that there should be no punishment for hanging
 ham chaahate hai ki isamen badlaav ho, umraqaid kii paribhaasha badale
 
 
 
 umraqaid kaa matlab hona chahie zindagi ke aakiri din tak jail
 
 
 At present, only 14 years in prison is a jail term

 But as soon as the news came that the proposal against the hanging of Afzal Guru could be passed in the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly, the collective consciousness immediately started dancing all over North India
 vahaan prastaav to paas nahin hua lekin punjab main jab rajoana kii faansee kaa virodh hua to samuhik chetana chuttee manaane kalka mail se shimla chali gai
 The comments march 2012 main balavant singh rajoana kii faansee ke virodh main akali dal ne punjab band kaa aahvaan kiya
 Congress state president Captain Amarinder Singh also opposed the hanging and the Akali Dal did it
 bijepi ne kabhi apni line nahin badali magar kabhi apana dost nahin badla
 The BJP still supports hanging but also gives the opposition a place in its government
 balavant singh rajoana jis aatankwaadi hamale main doshi paye gaye the usamen mukhyamantri sahit 17 log maare gaye the
 At that time Rajoana also wrote a letter that i do not need any help from the Akali Dal leaders
 inhone sikhon ko nyaay dilaane ke liye kuch nahin kiya he
 History will never forgive the Akali Dal
 phir bhi akali dal ne samarthan kiya or faansee kii sazaa umr kaid main badali
 Today we are with the Akali Dal, Congress, BJP and CPM leaders with whom we will talk if they have the courage to protest against the execution of the frenzy like a few lawyers
