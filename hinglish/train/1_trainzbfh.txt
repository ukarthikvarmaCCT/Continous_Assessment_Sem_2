 If you are troubled by Mangal Dosh and Mangal Dosh kept your life happy, then there is a temple in Ujjain that gives you freedom from this defect
 ujjain ko puraanon main mangal kii janani kaha jaataa he
 Such people, whose Mars is heavily in the horoscope, come here to offer prayers for the peace of their evil planets
 kaha jaataa he ki mangalanath ke darbar main bhaat puja se kaise mangal dosha dur ho jaataa he
 Why do people fear in the name of Mangal Dosh Mangal Dosh is such a situation that any person who gets into the horoscope has to face a very strange situation
 mangal dosha kundali ke kisi bhi ghar main sthit ashubh mangal ke dwaara banaae jane vaale dosha ko kehete hai jo kundali main apni sthiti or bal ke chalate jataka ke jivan ke vibhinn kshetron main samasyaayein utpann kar saktaa he
 Mangal Dosh is completely based on the position of the planets
 vaidic jyotish ke anusaar yadi kisi jataka ke janm chakra ke pehle, chauthe, saatven, aathven or barahawein ghar main mangal ho to aisi sthiti main paidaa hua jataka mangalik kaha jaataa he
 This situation is considered extremely inauspicious for marriage
 sambandho main tanaav va bikharaav, ghar main koi anhoni va apriy ghatana, kaary main bevajaah baadha or asuvidha tathaa kisi bhi prakaar kii kshati or dampatti kii asamayik mrityu kaa kaaran mangalik dosha ko mana jaataa he
 According to astrology, one Manglik should marry another Manglik
 yadi var or vadhu mangalik hote he to donon ke mangal dosha ek dusre ke yoga se samaapt ho jate he
 Originally according to the nature of Mars, such a planetary yoga shows harmful effects, but through Vedic worship process can control its horrors
 mangal grah kii puja ke dwaara mangal dev ko prasann kiya jaataa he, tathaa mangal dwaara janit vinaashkari prabhaavon ko shant va niyantrit kar sakaaratmak prabhaavon main vruddhi kii ja sakati he
 Such people whose Mars is heavily in the horoscope, they come to worship in Mangalnath temple for the peace of their evil planets, because in the Puranas, the city of Ujjain has been called the mother of Mars
 puure bharat se log yahaan par aakar mangal dev kii puja aradhana karte hai
 Those in whose horoscope Mars is heavy, they worship Bhat here for peace

 cricket ke ek ausat mukaable main agar team india bangladesh jaisi team ko haraa de, to is khabar ko media main jitani charchaa milti he, utani shaayad kisi duusare khel main aap world cap kaa khitaab bhi jeet len to nahin milegi
 This is the reason why India's blind cricketer won the World Cup title in an exciting way, then there was not much discussion
 ab yahi haal kabddi world cap kaa khitaab jeetne vaali bhartiya team ke saath hua he
 That too when both men's and women's teams captured the World Cup
 bharat ne lagaataar paanchavin baar world cap kabddi kaa khitaab jeeta he
 India won the World Cup by defeating Pakistan 45-42 in a thrilling match at the Guru Gobind Singh Stadium in Badal Muktsar, Punjab, while on the other hand, the women's team defeated New Zealand by 36-27 points and won the World Cup title for the fourth consecutive time
 is
 bhartiya team kii is dohari kamyaabi kii koi charchaa tab dekhne ko nahin mili jab ek lambey arase se kabddi kii duniya main bharat kaa dabadabaa he
 Kabaddi has been involved in the Asian Games since 1990, since then India has become the champion in it
 world cap kii shuruyaat ke baad bhartiya team hi lagaataar champion ban rahi he
 Nobody knows about these superstar players who have achieved success year after year
 na to bazaar unhen apana bikaoo cheharaa maanata he or na hamaara samaaj unhen role model ke taur par apanaataa he
 The market has a strange resemblance to the marketable face and role model
 role model banane ke liye yaa to aapako bikaoo hona padegaa yaa phir koi doosraa bikaoo cheharaa aapako bechney main lag jaae to bhi baat ban sakati he
 The problem is that Kabaddi superstars do not fit on both these scales nor are they trying to fit them
 haalanki pichley hi dinon ek nijee tivi samooh dwaara pryojit pro kabddi lig ke dauraan yah saaf najar aayaa ki bharat ke gramin ilaakon kaa khel kabddi ab mahanagaron main dhooma machaa rahaa he
 Other celebrities including Amitabh Bachchan, Aamir Khan, Shah Rukh Khan and Sachin Tendulkar were seen at the stadium to witness this traditional game
 tab ek ummid bandhi thi, kabddi ko lekar
 In addition to the Pro Kabaddi League, a World Kabaddi League was also organized
 laga tha ki gramin ilaakon ke is khel ke bahaane karporate samooh or bazaar kii takatein desh kii 65 fisadi aabaadi ko target karengi
 The game will also be good in his efforts
 lekin, tasviir utani chamakdaar thi nahin, jitani bataai ja rahi thi
 Kabaddi, which is considered the game of the villages of India, has now reached 33 countries of the world, but in its own country, its pace is not increasing
 haalanki ye baat ab saaf ho chuki he ki kabddi ko bhi praayojak mil sakate hai, ye bhi tivi par dikhaaya ja saktaa he
 It can also be popular
 aalochana karne vaale ye bhi kehete hai ki agar duusare khel ke khilaadi acha nahin karenge to phir bazaar ko hi dosha kyon den, aisa kabddi ke saath nahin kaha ja saktaa he
 This crisis is not even for the society, if this crisis were for the society, the game of kabaddi would not have survived
 to phir kabddi ke saath mushkil kya he, mujhe to jawaab nahin mil rahaa, aap bhi sochiega
 i will tell you, i will be waiting for your reply

 rigerv bank ne 2012-13 ke liye maudrik niti kii ghoshnaa karne se pehle 'aarthik or maudrik vikaas' report jari karte hue kaha ki varsh 2012-13 main vikaas dar main thodaa sudhaar hoga
 Inflation has come down slightly, but there is a risk of it remaining intact
 bank ne haalanki kaha ki vikaas ko badhaava dene kii jarurat he, lekin usne daron main katautee kaa sanket nahin diya
 Most analysts expect the RBI to cut key policy rates by 25 basis points
 yadi aisa hota he, to yah teen varsho main dar main pehali katautee hogi
 The Reserve Bank said that inflation is expected to remain at the current level in 2012-13

 Many Indian scientists have disagreed over the remarks made by Union Minister Satyapal Singh on Charles Darwin's theory related to the origin of humans
 mantri ne darwin kii is theory ko 'vaigyanik tareeke se galat' bataaya tha jisapar bhartiya vaigyanikon kaa kahana he ki unhone yah bayaan bini kisi vaigyanik aadhaar ke diya he
 At the same time, the scientists have also protested against the demand of the Minister, in which the change in the curriculum of the school and college has been said
 vaigyanikon ne kaha he ki aisa koi bhi kadam peeche kii ore le jane vaala hoga
 Minister of State for Human Resource Development Satyapal Singh said during a program that the theory of development given by Darwin was wrong as our ancestors have not mentioned anywhere that they saw a monkey turning into a human
 unhone kaha tha ki darwin kaa siddhant (manushya kaa kramik vikaas) vaigyanik drushti se galat he
 It should be changed in school and college curriculum
 manushya ko jab se dharti par dekha gaya vah manushya hi tha
 He had said, "no one, including our ancestors, wrote or verbally said that they saw a monkey turning into a human
 hamane jo bhi kitaaben padhi hai yaa daadi-nani dwaara hamen sunai gai kahaniyon main kahin bhi iskaa zikr nahin miltaa he
 "reacting to Singh's statement, scientists from three science academies of India said that" the minister's statement has no scientific basis
 "vaigyanikon dwaara jari ek bayaan main kaha gaya, "kramik vikaas kaa siddhant jiske jariye darwin ne atyant prabhaavshaalee yogadan die hai, vah sarvamaanya he
 There is no scientific controversy in the basic facts of evolution

 Bhalchandra Joshi is one of the most popular storytellers of our time
 17 april ko unka janmdin he
 On this occasion, he wrote a very emotional, sensitive and poignant story 'A scared father's letter based on the concerns and relations of the father and the village, small town, the father who has gone abroad in the path of modernity and progress
 , The daughter's name is made especially available to the readers of 'sahitya Aaj Tak'
 padhein yah kahanehkahaneethek dare hue pita kii chitthee, beti ke naam[aayudh ke liye - jo ekaek itnaa bada ho gaya he ki mere liye ek taral dilasa or bada sambal ban gaya he
 ] - Bhalchandra Josipriya daughter, i would be a little surprised to get my letter to you all of a sudden
 internet or mobile ke is yug main patr koun likhata hoga ? jane kitne din ho gaye tumhen dekha nahin
 It has been years since we sat talking properly and sitting uprightly
 us din jab tumhaare janmdin par maine online shoping karke tumhen ek tedi-bear bheja to tumhaari pratikriya se main chakit rah gaya
 You said that, 'papa! i have grown up now
 pi
 Yes
 karke naukari kar rahi hoon
 'then i thought if you really grew up
 aathvin class tak tum hamaare saath yahan ghar main rahi
 Then left the city to study
 phir naukari ke liye videsh chali gai
 i did not even see your childhood properly
 ek pita kaa durbhaagya isse bada kya hoga ki usne apni beti ko bada hote nahin dekha he or main aaj bhi tumhaare liye tedi-bear kharidta hoon
 Time has stopped for me
 jab tum choti-si thi or padhane ke liye duusare shahar chali gai
 Far away kabhi-kabhi skip par tumhen dekhtaa hoon to aisa lagata he jaise tum kahin dur kisi ajanabi grah se bol rahi ho
 It feels good to see you, but touching up and sitting and talking like that has become very difficult
 kuch chijen samay ke aise mohak or anivaary jaal main fasati he ki tumhaara janaa bhi jaruri tha or tumhaare se alag hone kaa dukh ek duusari anivaaryta he
 Every person has a past in life
 aise badanaseeb to gine-chune honge jinke paas ateet kii smritiyaan mit chuki hongi
 i have this strange time in which there is both happiness and sadness of memories
 kabhi-kabhi to ateet kii vah sukhad smritiyaan hi takalif detii hai
 The place where you have joined the race for an anonymous place of success, happiness and prosperity, daughter is nowhere
 ise kabhi tum khud samaj sako to thik varanaa mere liye to samajhaana bhi samay ne kathin kar diya he
 i never comfort my mind with the curse that i wish i had not sent you to study outside, but i also know that this is a very selfish and fruitless comfort
 samay kaa krur lava har shahar kii har gali main daakhil hoga or sab kuch swaha kar degaa
 a pile of ashes filled with sorrows
 jise tatolane par chote-bade dukhon ke kankar-pathar or koyale ke tukade milenge
 There will be ashes to soak history
 fasebuk par saikadon mitra hai lekin sthiti yah he ki rishte itane aupchaarik banate ja rahe hai ki padosi se akelaapan baantna uske samay ko nasht karne main shaamil ho gaya he
 We meet in the neighborhood, talk, but some late comrades come to roam on the morning walk
 beti, tum cellphone ke miseges main ho, computer ke melbox main ho, tasveeron main ho lekin saath nahin ho
 Sometimes you feel sad that you do not have any younger or elder brother or sister, if this happens then the house would have been full but then i think as if you have gone, it would have had to go
 in dinon yahan jaada bahut he
 Me and your mother are alone in this big house
 lagbhag niyamit ghatiya hindi dharawahikon ko bahut ruchi or manoyog se dekhte hai or ghor bhavukta ke saath us par bahes bhi karte hai
 Occasionally, old and worn-out hats try to make each other laugh and find solace for each other in the same effort
 haalaanki saath rahete hai, saath main khate hai
 Go for a walk together
 saath main sote hai
 They sit together and talk but like two strangers traveling in a train
 ham donon ke ateet kisi band andhere kamare main hai
 One can only find the presence of your presence, but it is not possible
 yahi hamaare samay kii traasadee he
 You are far away but happy because the path to a world of full prosperity and happiness starts from the distance, away from the family and the cacophony of missing your childhood
 main to mahaj isliye khush hoon ki tum khush ho
 Even after much deliberation, i could not find any other reason for happiness
 main or tumhaari maan ghar main akele hai
 While the whole house is full of memories of you
 jo samay tumhaare saath jiya vah bhi or tumhaare saath samay bitaane kii ichha thi us dukh ke bhi hajaaron kone is ghar main hai
 i and your mother love each other very much but the whole house is so full of your memories and sorrow of absence that both of us sometimes or nowadays are stuck in the same or stuck everyday
 tumhaare dada kii mrityu kii soochna to maine tumhen usee din de di thi
 First your phone call was received again
 tumhen company se chuttee nahin mil paa rahi he or shaayad kuch vija kii samasya bataa rahi thi
 At your behest, i have put the ashes of my father's ashes in a copper vessel in a safe corner of the cupboard
 haalaanki tumhaara aagrah tha ki us paatr ko bank ke loker main rakh do lekin bharosa rakho, vah paatr ghar main bhi utana hi surakshit rahegaa
 Even the bones could have left Narmada and come, but you insist that it should be done in your presence when you come
 tumhaari vivashtaa se upje is aparaadh-bodh ko main samaj rahaa hoon
 Perhaps you were telling your mother that the company's brothers
 em
 Said that if he had got married, he would have possibly been discharged, but the company says what is the meaning of leaving after death? What difference does it make to your presence or absence? Your company has an annual function in March
 tumne yah bhi bataaya ki company march tak target se zyada echiv karegi isliye jaahir he ki ek bada bonus, tarakkee or cocktail party rahegi
 All these things may have some meaning but i could not understand
 tumhaare dada gaanv main kisaan the
 Never bought a freeze at home despite being in position

 , gaschulhaa, e
 C
 or yahan tak ki cycle tak nahin kharidi
 He said that the life of my forefathers and almost all of my life went without any of them without any pleasure and without any inconvenience
 tumhaare dada in sabko gairajaruri samajhate the or puri umr ek sahaj jivan jeene ke tark ko bade pramaan kii tarah hamen saunpkar chale gaye
 They used to say, keep desires small, do not let them become needs
 apane jivan main ek kaam unhone bada kiya
 He wished to open a school in the village
 gaanv main shahar jaati pagadendi ko sadak banane kii thi
 Once you get good prices of crops
 upaj or khariddaar ke bich ke dalal khatm ho jaaen
 There were many desires that almost all of them left with him
 choti-choti ichchhaaon ke kai adrishy khet bo rakhe the jo dhire dhire ujadte chale gaye or bazaar ke khariddaaron ke liye ek lubhaavni banjar jameen bachi rah gai
 Fafaji's fields in the village are also desolate
 foofaaji ne pichley hafte aatmahatya kar lee
 He said that the income from the crop was half of what was spent on spraying manure-seeds and medicines
 karj ho gaya tha
 They used to say that if you go to buy wheat or any other grain in the market, you get expensive
 bechney jaao to kodiyon ke mol kharidte hai
 Perhaps you will not understand this duality and conspiracy to grab large part of the farmer and his produce
 khayr chodo
 The scale of character has changed from leader, officer, actor to industrialist
 jail jaakar lautne vaale bhi sammanit hone lage hai
 Religion has changed into a big market
 chaar saadhuon ko jail hoti he to chalis nai bhashaa, nai bhangimaaon ke saath aa jate hai
 Now it is seen that which brand of sage a person wears
 kis brand ke juute yaa khadaau pahentaa he
 Which brand of wine or woman uses
 kis gaadi se neeche utarataa he
 Even which brand lives
 kitne bade pandal main bhaashan yaa pravachan detaa he
 There are luxurious palaces for those who become disloyal and give up discourses of Maya, which are called Ashrams in the market language and from where crores of property is recovered
 laachaar or dharm ke naam par ashram main jabaran rakhi gai striyon ke saath balaatkaar ke kisson kii durgandh bhi baraamad hone lagi he
 The interesting thing is that even though your generation has started to understand such a religion of religion, it is unfortunate that our generation is stuck in its neck
 kabhi-kabhi to mujhe lagata he ki in saadhuon se zyada behatar pravachan to main de saktaa hoon
 If i do not become a writer or do not want to continue, i can become a better rogue and a modern monk
 kya karnaa he ? thodaa-sa chal, dher sara fareb, tuchhi, jhooth or charitraheenta kaa ek jakhira hi to chahie, jo kahin kharidne bhi nahin janaa padegaa lekin kya karen ? jo ek baar lekhak ho jaataa he vah phir jivan bhar lekhak hi bane rahanaa chahta he
 Everything is like one-way traffic
 lautne kaa koi rasta nahin he kyonki lubhaavni ichchhaaon kii hatya karke hi to vyakti lekhak banataa he or phir se lautne ke liye ek lekhak kii hatya karnaa bahut kathin kaam he
 Even those who do so fail in both places
 pataa nahin likhte-likhte kahan bhatak gaya or kaise bahak gaya
 The loneliness of relationships leads to such disorientation
 main akelepan se nahin darataa
 i am afraid of the darkness of loneliness
 akelepan main to smritiyaan bhi sahaara ban jaati hai lekin akelepan ke andhere main kuch bhi nahin hota he
 What happens is a nervous struggle with the feeling of having nothing in the darkness of loneliness just to save the memories
 khayr
 
 
 
 tumne mujhe angreji kaa ek upanyaas bheja tha
 i have read it like that
 tumne us upanyaas kii aisi tarif kii thi ki mujhe laga tha ki upanyaas koi premchand, gorki yaa dostoyavski ke str kii cheez hoga
 It is a very superficial, simple and almost meaningless novel written with Shiva at its center
 kaash ki tumne shivpurana padhaa hota to tumhen yah upanyaas heere ke saamne pathar kaa tukdaa lagata
 i find it very scary that you have read Indian Mythology so far, even history is a mere name or have seen it in poor novels or in films
 beti, vah peedi bauddhik rup se bahut vipann hoti he jiske paas itihaas bodh nahin hota
 Which is unfamiliar with mythological stories
 ise dharmik pothiyon kii bhanti nahin, gyaan kii sampatti kii tarah padho, yah tumhaare liye aasaan bhi hoga kyonki sampatti shabd se hi tumhaari peedi ke bheetar ek bechaini paidaa karne vaala aakarshan paidaa ho jaataa he
 i am not going to cry but the courage to stand in front of the mirror of truth will probably be left in you
 ek dikkat to yah he ki yahan bharat main jab din hota he tab tumhaare america main raat ho jaati he
 We are standing at almost opposite ends to seek or gain light
 isiilie sambhawatah hamaare ujaalon kaa sach bhi utana hi virodhabhasi he
 Daughter, sometimes i get very depressed, desperate and filled with guilt and fear that what a cruel and scary world our generation is leaving for you

 nikammi, lobhi police, andhaa nyaay or krurta se bhari duniya
 Earth means a time filled with money relations, while there is no fault of our generation in the creation of that world, only a middle class greed, false pride that children are abroad and earning in dollars

 ‘aaj main jeene‘ kaa naaraa bazaar ne diya he or yah naaraa tumhen vahiin tak jane detaa he jahaan tak tumhaari jeb khaali nahin ho jaati he
 The market does not even let you know how many terrible things and situations it is leaving with you
 yah aane vaale daraavne samay kii aahat he
 How strange that the time you are enjoying is the horrors of the time to come

 is samay ne tum logon ke bheetar se aashirwad or shubhakamanaayon kii icchaayen chhinakar khud ko dosha rahit bhi pramanit kar liya he
 Our hands and mouth are full of chants for blessings but strangely listened to and with painful emptiness

 i am not afraid of your generation's declarations of love and agreements, but rather the conceptions and definitions of love created by the market that are against the trajectory of the roots of love

 He was also present in the late night meeting at Yogendra Yadav's house on Monday
 twit main kumaar vishwaas ne kaha, 'teen ghante kii neend ke baad bhi sukun he
 we will succeed
 ' mulakaaton or baithkon kaa silsilaa jari he
 Who met whom, whom did not celebrate Diwali, but with Yogendra Yadav, only Kumar Vishwas played
 jaise hi kejariwal bangaloru se dilli land kiye aap kii ek team yogendra yadav se milane unke ghar pahunchi
 It included Ashutosh, Sanjay Singh, Kumar Vishwas and Ashish Khaitan
 iske baad yahi team prashanth bhushan se bhi milane vaali thi, lekin prashanth bhushan ne ashish khetaan se milane se inkaar kar diya
 In fact, Khaitan had made a tweet about Bhushan's family, which he was angry about
 haalanki agle hi din unhone maafee bhi maang lee thi
 Now he will also go out of delhi
before going on leave, a tweet by Kejriwal showed that he wants to keep the focus on Delhi itself
 ab sanjay singh kaa bayaan aayaa he ki party dilli se baahar bhi paanv failaane kii koshish karegi
 Sanjay Singh says, 'the party will expand
 anya rajyon main apane sanghathan ko majboot karne ke liye kaam karenge
 In which states the party should contest, it will be decided only by looking at the political capacity and leadership in those states
 'aap main vivaad kii ek badi vajah ye thi ki kejariwal sirf dilli tak simit rahanaa chaahate the, jabaki yogendra yadav dilli se baahar bhi raajnneeti kii baat kar rahe the
 It was seen that after the Delhi elections all the people were set, Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan had no work left
 sawaal ye uth rahe the ki agar party dilli tak hi simit rahi to baaki hisson ke aap kaaryakarta kya karenge? ve party ke agle farmaan kaa intjaar kar paaenge yaa duusari partiyon kii ore rukh kar lenge? to ab kya samajha jaae ki party ne yogendra yadav kii baat maan lee he? yaa phir ye bataanaa chaahate hai ki ye to pehle se hi party ke agenda main tha, bas praathamiktaaon main shaamil nahin tha
 So that yadav-bhushan's letter could not get any attention
 aakhir baaki kya rahaa?yogendra yadav or prashanth bhushan par aarope laga tha ki ve arvind kejariwal ko sanyojak pad se hataanaa chaahate hai
 For this Yogendra Yadav brought news in the media
 prashanth bhushan par aarope rahaa ki wo chaahate the ki aap dilli chunaav haar jaae taaki kejariwal kaa dimag thikaane aa sake
 Later, both of them wrote a joint letter in which Kejriwal was charged with the greatest benefit that after the defeat in the Lok Sabha elections, he tried to form the government again with the Congress
 iske baad to ek ke baad ek sting saamne aane lage jinamein se ek main sanket ye bhi tha ki kathith taur par kejariwal vidhayakon kii kharid farokht karnaa chaahate the
 Prashant Bhushan sent a message to meet as soon as Khandankejriwal returned to Delhi, offering to resign
 is par kejariwal ne ye to bataaya ki mulaakaat jald hogi, lekin kab hogi ye nahin bataaya
 Now Prashant Bhushan wrote a new letter and offered it to him
 hameshaa sweet or sanjidagi bhari baaten karne vaale yogendra yadav khamosh hai
 Kejriwal has not tweeted yet about this
 baad memprashanth bhushan ne bhi is baat se inkaar kar diyaaki unhone istife kii peshkash kii he
 It was a coincidence that Arvind Kejriwal and Yogendra Yadav met in the afternoon on Tuesday
 mulaakaat jab adaalat main hui to donon ne ghar ke jhagade kaa asar chehre par nahin aane diya
 Does Yogendra Yadav have the same sweetness left in his mind? By the way, what was going on in the minds of both of them is an inside matter

 unhone kaha tha, 10 din puraani company ko vimaan banane kaa kaam dilaane ke peeche piem kaa vishesh prem he
 In fact, during the debate on the no confidence motion in the Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi took on the Modi government for the Rafale plane deal
 unhone aarope lagaaya tha ki tatkaaleen upie sarkaar kii deal radd kar france ke saath nai deal karne ke peeche makasad ek nijee company ko phayda pahunchaana tha
 At the same time, the Congress has given notice of breach of privilege in the Lok Sabha against Prime Minister Modi and Defense Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in this case
 party kaa aarope he ki rafel vimaanon kii keemat bataane ke sandarbh main modi or sitaraman ne sadan ko gumraah kiya he
 Let me tell you, when the Rafale deal was done by the UPA government, Anil Ambani's company Reliance Defense had no name
 is company kaa gathan march 2015 main hua or iske kareeb dedh saal baad sitambar 2016 main modi sarkaar ne france ke saath rafel vimaan ke liye nayaa sauda kiya
 Significantly, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi attacked the Modi government in December 2017, saying that he ignored the public sector undertaking Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) and decided in favor of Anil Ambani's Reliance Defense Ltd
, to build the plane
 Has no previous experience
 nae samjhaute ke mutabik bharat main rafel vimaanon ke nirmaan kaa kaam reliance dephence ke dwaara hi kiya jayega
 On March 28, 2015, Anil Ambani's Reliance Group ventured into the defense sector and formed a company called Reliance Defense
 iske baad 23 sitambar, 2016 ko endie sarkaar ne france ke saath rafel vimaanon kii kharid kaa samjhauta kiya
 Two and a half months later, on 16 December 2016, Reliance set up a joint venture Reliance Rafale with Rafale
 rochak yah he ki piem modi ne reliance dephence kii bharat main sthapana ke 13 din baad hi france ke apane daure par 10 april, 2015 ko rafaal saude kii ghoshnaa kii
 India today-aaj Tak has a copy of the letter that Anil Ambani has written to Rahul Gandhi
 is letters main unhone tark diya he ki reliance ko yah sauda isliye mila kyonki uske paas dephence ship banane kaa anubhav tha
 This letter is dated December 12, 2017
 is letters main anil ambani ne likhaa tha, 'mujhe yah jaanakar vyaktigat rup se kaaphi dukh hua he ki congress ke kuch netaa mere or mere samooh ke bare main durbhagyapurna bayaan de rahe hai
 At the same time, all kinds of comments have been made about our JV with Dashau

 1
 i request that by calling a special session of the Delhi Legislative Assembly, what emergency steps can be taken immediately from these Rs 1500 crore left with the government, a detailed discussion should be held in the House
 2
 In order to explain the seriousness of the subject to the members, some experts like the venerable Bhure Lal or Sunita Narayan should also be called to the House
 3
 a task force should be formed by the House, which has the best experts in the country and the best officers of the government, who should prepare an action plan for Delhi

 4
 meraa maananaa he ki sarkaar ke paas jo 1500 karod rupee bache hue hai, usase dilli sarkaar kai kadam uthaa sakati he

 The celebrity girl Liza Malik, who became famous for proposing a cricketer in the reality show Dancing Queen, has suddenly come into the limelight for the fixing of international cricket

 In lieu of this work, Liza Malik was offered Rs 50 lakhs

 The caller said that he knows that i have a good relationship with some of the cricketers, and that he should talk to those cricketers
 usne mujhe kaha ki agar vah cricketer 'mere hisaab se khele' to vah mujhe 50 lakh rupee degaa
 When i gave him a slightly rude reply, he told me that i would have to face something bad for not doing so
 pakistan ke sheersh videsh salaahkaar ne kaha he ki 48 sadasyeey parmaanu aapurtikarta samooh (enesji) main shaamil hone ke bharat ke prayaas ko rokane ke liye pakistan prabhaavshaalee dhang se lagaataar prayaas kar rahaa he
 The Prime Minister's foreign affairs adviser Sartaj Aziz said in Pakistan's Senate, "pakistan's efforts for a non-discriminatory approach will bring color
 'bharat ko mil rahe samarthan se daraa pakajija kaa yah bayanbharat ke enesji main shaamil hone ke prayasor is disha main desh ko america or switzraland ke mili samarthan ke baad aayaa he
 Aziz was responding to Pakistani senators' concern over 'increasing collusion between India and Pakistan' and their apprehension that NSG member countries would respond positively to India's request to join it
 bharat ke aagrah par ho rahaa he vichaarbharat or pakistan donon ne hi enesji kii sadsyta ke liye aavedan kiya he, jisase donon deshon ko parmaanu vyapaar main shaamil hone kii anumati milegi
 Chairman of the Security Committee of the Senate and Senator Mushahid Hussain Syed of Pakistan Muslim league-q said that the NSG members would be considering India's request to join the group
 bharat kii vajah se PAK kii entry par lag sakati he roksaiyad ne yah aarope lagaaya ki pakistan kii kootneeti 'asafal' ho gai he
 He said that if India becomes a member of the NSG, it will be able to prevent Pakistan from joining the group
 unhone kaha, 'hamane iran or afghanistan ko alag-thalag kar diya he or donon desh ab bharat ke saath apane aarthik sambandh behatar kar rahe hai
 Troubled by India's growing friendship with neighboring countries, PAK Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently traveled to Afghanistan and Iran, which are close neighbors of Pakistan
 saiyad ne kaha, 'yah hamaari kootnithik asafalataa he
 Indians surround us from all sides
 yahaan tak ki iran or afghanistan jaise hamaare najdiki padosiyon ne bhi bharat kii yatra kii he
 This is the result of the failure of our diplomacy and traditionally dysfunctional foreign policy
 'khud par khatre kaa akalan kar rahaa pakistanunhone sainya upayon se bharat kaa muqabla karne ke prayaason ke alaava desh kii aantarik 'ekajutata' par bhi bal diya
 He said that India should not be allowed to take advantage of the internal situation of Pakistan

 ajij ne kaha ki pakistan hind mahaasaagar ko parmanukrit karne kii bharat kii yojana ke 'khatarnaak nihitarth' ko bhi ujagar karne kii yojana bana rahaa he
 He said that Pakistan is also considering the option of presenting a proposal to declare the Indian Ocean nuclear free in the United Nations General Assembly
 film kaa naam: jiya or jiyadiarector: howard rosemaayerstar cast: kalki kochalin, richa chaddha, arsalan goni, jarina vahaivadhi: 1 ghanta 33 minutesrtificate: u / aretimga: 1
 After being a 5-star choreographer and actor, Howard Rosmaire has directed his first film 'jia Aur Jia'
 iske pehle unhone industry main bahut sari filmon main kaam kiya he
 Now he has tried to make a film on a different kind of subject
 kahanikahani do aisi mahilaon (kalki kochalin or richa chaddha) kii he, jo ek-duusare se kaaphi alag hai
 Apart from just Naam (both of them named Jiya), the two have nothing in common but they meet during a Sweden trip and the two find their partners in each other
 tabhi kahani main kai saare twist or terns aate hai or vaasu (archelan goni) kii entry hoti he
 Jiya Venkat (richa Chadha) is troubled in her personal life while Jiya Garewal (kalki Cochleen) lives her life full on
 kai sari baaten saamne nikalakar aati he or akhirkaar kya hota he iskaa pataa aapako film dekhakar hi chalegaa
 Richa Chadha is living with Ali Fazal in Venice, what are they doing to each other? The film is very weak in terms of story and after a while it seems that we are finally seeing it
 - kahani par zyaada kaam kiya jaataa to film bahut acchhee ban sakati thi
 The screenplay of the film is also quite faded
 - ikkaa dukka sanvaadon par hansi aati he, lekin puri film ubaau lagati he
 In a way, the film seems less and more of an advertisement for Sweden tourism
 producers ke saath sone ko taiyaar auraton se he naaraazgi- richaa chaddhaakyon dekh sakate hai- filofilm kii shooting sweden main kii gai he, jisaki lokation kaaphi dilachasp he
 Also Richa Chadha, Kalki can watch this film for the smooth acting of Cochleen
 archelan goni kaa kaam thik-thaak he
 The music is good and the song Jiya o Jiya which is playing in the background sounds quite good
 agar aap richa chaddha yaa kalki kochalin ke bade diwane hai to ek baar dekh sakate hai
 The budget of the box office film is very low and the producers of Sweden have invested money in this film, which may have reduced the production cost
 golmaal agen or sikret superstar pehle se hi baks ofis par hit hai
 It will be interesting to see whether the audience will like to watch this movie in the theater or wait to come on TV
 yahaan dekhie 70vengantantr diwas (70th Republic Day) kii shandaar jhaankiyon kii dil ko khush kar dene vaali tasviren

 com / czufpjmqbk subah-subah samaajawaadee party ke loksabhaa or rajyasabha ke saansadon ko aisa sandesh aayaa ki wo hairat main pad gaye
 In fact, the message of Samajwadi Party patron Mulayam Singh Yadav was that Netaji has called a meeting of all mps in the party office of Parliament House
 sapa kunbe kii kalah ke baad se party ke saansadon kii pehali baar sansad main baithak bulaai gai, wo bhi party adhyaksh se sangrakshak ban chuke mulaayam singh kii taraf se
 According to the sources, many mps were in a hurry to decide what to do
 iske baad kuch ne akhilesh ke kareebi mahasachiv ramgopal yadav se poocha
 Ram Gopal, after discussing with Akhilesh, gave a message to everyone that the leader is our mentor and if he has called a meeting, then you go to him
 zyaadaatar saansad aapas main charchaa karte hue pahunche ki chaliye parivaar main sulah kii shuruyaat to hui
 Some also decided that they would request Netaji to unite the family and prepare for the elections
 mulaayam kii baithak main nahin aae ye saansadahaalanki, sapa kii daraar kitni gahari he, iskaa andaja bhi isi baithak main najar aa gaya
 In the meeting called by Netaji, SP President Akhilesh Yadav's MP wife Dimple Yadav did not reach because she was not in Delhi
 lekin akhilesh ke kareebi ramgopal yadav or unke bete akshay yadav bhi baithak se dur rahe
 At the same time, Naresh Aggarwal, close to Ram Gopal, also considered it appropriate to stay away from the meeting called by Netaji
 baaki kareeb-kareeb sabhi saansadon ne baithak main hissaa liya
 MP from Mulayam family Dharmendra Yadav also attended the meeting
 congress sapa kii dushman: mulaayambaithak shuru hone par kabhi mulaayam ko ram or khud ko unka hanuman bataane vaale sapa se nikaale gaye amar singh ke nahin hone par saansadon ko laga ki ye sakaaratmak baat he or parivaar main sulah ke liye acha sanket he
 When asked about this, Mulayam said, "yes, i have a meeting with mps in the morning
 ' mulaayam ne saansadon ko naseehat dete hue kaha ki sansad satr ke dauraan bhi shanivaar-ravivaar ke din saansadon ko apane kshetra kaa daura karnaa chahie
 According to sources, after this Mulayam said that, which once again shattered the hope of reconciliation
 mulaayam ne kaha ki, congress siyaasi taur par hamaari dushman rahi he or usase samjhauta karnaa hamaari party kii badi bhul rahi
 Will there be a grand alliance in 2019? This is Mulayam's statement which is contrary to Akhilesh's political line, also falsifying Akhilesh's decision
 aakhir akhilesh to vidhansabha chunaav mencongresske saath talmail ke baavjood badi haar ke baad bhi har bade maukey par congress ke saath hi dikhe hai
 Be it the election of the President or the vice-president
 sutron kii maane to 2019 ke liye akhilesh congress, sapa or basapa ke mahagathbandhan ke shuruaati edia ke bhi saath hai
 In such a situation, there are many unresolved questions that stand in front of the open
 aakhir shivpal kaa kya hoga? akhilesh kya adhyaksh pad mulaayam ko saunpenge? kya mulaayam ke baar-baar kehane par akhilesh ramgopal ko kinare karenge? sapa ko pehle safagoi se in sawaalon ke jawaab talashne honge, tabhi sulah kii gunjaaish ho paaegi varanaa dil bahalane ke liye baithak kaa siyaasi khel sivaay phixing se zyada kuch nahin hoga

 ) asaram kii giraftaar ke baad se hi ham sab assamram kii ekantavaas or dhyaan kutiyaa ke bare main sun rahe hai
 After all, why did Asaram need seclusion? What did he do in seclusion, which he could not do between his devotees and seekers? Why did Asaram get angry when he was disturbed in seclusion? According to the Jodhpur Police, this seclusion was only an excuse, in fact, Asaram's game was old in the guise of it
 ekantavaas ke bahaane ek ladki se zyaadati ke iljaam main jail janevaale asaram ko ab unka yahi ekantavaas baari padane laga he
 However, this is not the first time that Asaram has pretended to be in the name of meditation or meditation
 ye or baat he ki ab yon shoshan ke ek maamle main pakade jane ke baad asaram ke ekantavaas or iske liye banaae gaye thikaanon kaa sach ek-ek kar baahar aane laga he
 Asaram has not one, but many, hut
 kutiyaa number ek, jodhpur se kareeb 60 kilometre dur madhi kutiyaa he, jahaan 15 agast ko asaram ne ekantavaas ke naam par aisa kuch kiya, jisane unke sitare raaton-raat gardish main pahunchaa die
 Although the shanty is such a luxurious farm house built in the middle of the fields, which attracts the attention of every person passing through it, but Asaram and his trickster quartet call it as the meditation hut
 asaram par isi dhyaan kii kutiyaa main 15 agast ko anushthan ke naam par unhone ek ladki ke saath jyaadati karne kaa iljaam he
 The shocking thing is that Asaram's ashram is also present in Jodhpur, but in this rural area away from Jodhpur, Asaram often stays in the name of confinement and then when the mind is filled with exile, he leaves for the next destination
 , But know what is so in this hut of seclusion that the common people are not allowed to come and go, but it is also forbidden to pass by
 ekantavaas kii kutiyaa number do kii baat karen to yah indore main sarkari jameen par bani he
 To say that Asaram meditates here, stops for a while in remembrance of God, but a magnificent swimming bridge is also built near this building and CCTV cameras are installed on it
 sawaal yah uthta he ki jis jagah par bhagwaan kii bhakthi ke liye sukun ke do pal chahie, vahaan swimming pul or sisitivi camere jaisi aisho-aaraam or khaas hifaazati intjaamon kii kya jarurat he?indore shashan kii maane to asaram ke trust ko 1998 main yah jameen jin sharton ke saath gai thi, dhyaan kii kutiyaa banane ke chakkar main asaram or unke shargidon ne un sharton kii bhi dhajjiyaan uda deen
 The solitary slice number three, which was closed after Asaram was imprisoned, also has many secrets in itself
 asaram ko jaananevaalon kii maane to rajasthan aane par asaram aksar is kutiyaa main aakar rukate the, lekin hairaani is baat kii he ki asaram ke pravaas ke dinon main aam log to dur, saadhaaran saadhakon ko bhi unki is tathakthith dhyaan kii kutiyaa ke aas-paas fatakane kii ijaajat nahin hoti thi
 By the way, on 4 and 5 August, Asaram had spent the same time in the same hut before being accused of sexual abuse
 ekantavaas kii kutiyaa number chaar rajasthan ke paali jile main sinchai vibhaag kii jameen par pahadiyon ke bich bane ye kamare asaram to nahin, asaram ke sahabjade narayan sai ke ekantavaas kaa wo thikaana he, jise dur to kya, paas se bhi dekh kar samajhnaa mushkil he ki yahaan kisi ke thaharne kaa intazaam bhi ho saktaa he
 This room may be crispy now, but there was a time when Narayan Sai used to come here and spend time
 jaahir he gufaaon or kandaraon se lekar aaleeshaan mehalon or farm houseon main bane ekantavaas ke in thikaanon kaa tilism ab asaram ke pakade jane ke baad dhire-dhire jamaane ke saamne aam hone lage hai
 Now the question is, what happens in the name of spiritual practice in such secret locations? Why does a Guru have to distance himself from his devotees for spiritual practice? Why no one other than Asaram's special servicemen are allowed to go to such places? Why do Asaram, who teaches the world the lesson of patience and spirituality, gets jealous when someone accidentally goes to such places? And why have Asaram been inviting a select few girls to such places of seclusion? Asaram and his trickster quartet, who have been caught by the police, are investigating the case of sexual exploitation
 Asaram has a juggle of doing more with all girls, due to which Asaram forced many girls to surrender before him
 khaas baat ye he ki sadhana or samarpan ke naam par ladakiyon se nazdikiyaan badhaane ke mulgim asaram ne is ladki ko bhi ilaaj ke bahaane par jodhpur se kareeb 60 kilometre dur madhi kutiyaa naam ke aise hi ekantavaas vaali jagah par bulaayaa tha, lekin vahaan band kamare main is ladki ke saath jo kuch hua, use asaram ko salaakhon ke peeche pahunchaa diya
 Apparently, according to the Jodhpur police, there is nothing except Asaram's solitude, sadhana, dhyan ki kutiya and tricks to fool people
 somvaar subah upi ke baliya main naav palatney se 70 log ganga main dub gaye
 This accident is about eight o'clock
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki raahat or bachaav dal ke logon ne kareeb 15 logon ko surakshit baahar nikaal liya he or baaki bache logon ko nikaalane kii koshish jari he
 According to reports, bodies of 13 people have been recovered from the scene

 haalanki, vishleshkon kaa maananaa he ki america or china ne ji-20 shikhar sammelan main saptahanth vyapaar yuddh ko samaapt karne kii ghoshnaa kii he jisase bazaar main kuch teji dekhi ja sakati he
 Apart from this, the market will also be watching the progress of monsoon, fluctuations in rupee and crude oil
 samko sicurities and stoffnote ke sansthaapak evam mukhya kaaryakari adhikari jimit modi ne kaha, ‘chunaav nattejey adhik bhaavnaatmak aayojan tha jabaki bajet bazaar kii drushti se adhik taarkik vajah hoga
 The sluggishness before the budget may be the calm before the storm and the markets will remain stable but there will be pressure to go downwards
 ' unhone kaha ki vaahan kshetra dabaav main he
 How the government supports the sector will depend on whether the shares of these companies will rise or break
 apik research ke siio mustafa nadeem ne kaha, ‘hamaare saamne kaaphi mahatvapurn aayojan bajet he
 It is likely that the market will remain volatile and will affect it further in the short term
 chunki yah mahatvapurn kaarykram he isaliye hamaara maananaa he ki hamen philhal iskeane vaale nateezon kaa intjaar karnaa chahie
 'manufacturing and services sector PMI figures are due this week

 He said that we hope that the government will maintain the deficit at the appropriate level on the fiscal front in line with the previous budget

 Karan told that i had previously offered Fawad's role to 6 actors, but he was not ready to play the gay character
 aapako bataa den ki rajeev masand ne ek megsine main likhaa tha ki fawaad kaa role pehle saf ali khan, rithik roshan, farhaan akhtar, shahid kapur or aditya roy kapur ko ofer kiya gaya tha
 When Karan was asked about this, he told DNA- Yes, i offered Fawad's role to 6 actors, but no one did
 unhone jo bhi kaaran bataae ho, lekin mujhe lagata he ki wo screen par homosexual kairactor nahin nibhaana chaahate the
 'virushka' will be seen in 'coffee with Karan'? The actress gave the answer, she was asked that do you mind when the actors refuse to do your film? To this he said- No, when you go to the set, you should love your work
 isliye agar aap kisi dabaav ke kaaran film karte hai to iskaa asar aapke parformens par padataa he
 Many actors have not done me, but i definitely go to them whenever i need to

 If the investment in shares becomes more attractive for Indian savers, then the demand for gold will decrease automatically

 so, madhya pradesh main mahakaal kii nagari ujjain main 21 april kii vah chilchilaati dhoop vaali dopahari is myne main aitihaasik thi ki sarvatha upekshit, dab-chhipakar anaam jindagi bitaane waalon kaa jhanda aise dharmik aayojan main garv se ooncha laharaa rahaa tha
 a new arena was writing a new scripture about their existence against the sacred 13 saints of ascetics
 sinhasth main uski peshwai kuch zyada hi dhoomdhaam se nikal rahi thi
 The path of Peshwai was set via the Dussehra ground to Simhastha Camp
 lekin nae astitv kii is nai peshwai ne is maamle main bhi itihaas rach diya
 For the first time, a Peshwai emerged from a Muslim-dominated artillery locality
 chaaron ore jabardast bheed thi
 AC Baghi was ready for the head of the new arena
 jansailab ko dekha to ve khud ko roak na sakin or buggy chhod oont par savaar ho gayi
 People were desperate to touch her hands, and she kept saying, "I am not a goddess
" 
 
 '' lekin log apane bacchon ko aashirwad ke liye unki god main daal rahe the
 People were giving them money and the members of the arena were returning the money
 or kah rahe the ki ye paise ghar main rakho, barkat hogi
 In fact, the most alienated Peshwai was from the Kinnar Akhara and the head of the arena sitting on a camel was Lakshmi Narayan Tripathi
 arase se kinnaron ke adhikaron or sammaan ke liye sangharshrat lakshmi kahati hai, ''hamaari ladaai vajood kii he
 
 
 And this profession has given a new dimension to our existence
 ''kuch saal pehle tak to vajood kii is jang kii bhi kalpana nahin kii ja sakati thi
 Here, for some time, some thinking changed in the circles of society and government, and their solidarity also began to bring color
 akhaada to beshak ab unke astitv kii samaaj main pahchaan kaa nayaa aayam he
 Its aim, Lakshmi, states something like, "we have to connect the eunuchs across the country
" unke jeevanyaapan kaa bandobast karnaa he or vriddhashram jaisi suvidhaayen bhi muhaiyaa karaani hai
 "13 religious akharas are opposing the Kinnar Akhara in a mutilated tongue
 lekin lakshmi chunauti detii hai, ''ham shastrarth ke liye taiyaar hai
 If anyone wants to come
 hamaara akhaada har dharm ke liye khulaa he
 We will free those who oppose them
 ''kinnar akhaade se pehle kinnar band, kinnar cab or kinnar udhyami bhi apni pahchaan kaayam kar chuke hai
 It is a move with the new era of the Kinnar community
 yah samudaay khushi ke maukon par neg, majabuuran jismfaroshi or bhikshavriti se aage bad rahaa he
 Says Lakshmi, "we are working hard to find a lost existence
" sarkaar kaa saath mil rahaa he or samaaj kaa bhi
 "lakshmi Tripathi is the first eunuch who represented the asia-pacific region in the United Nations in 2008
 astitv naam se unka ek enjio he, jo sexual minurities ke liye kaam karata he
 The Kinnar Akhara is preparing to set up camp in every Kumbh
 kaha ja rahaa he ki 22 rajyon se 10,000 kinnar is akhaade se jud chuke hai
 Kamala Bua, who was the mayor of Sagar in Madhya Pradesh, who is primarily associated with the arena, says, "we want to tell through our arena that we should not be neglected
" ''shaayad is tarah ke prayaason se upeksha kaa yah dansh ab kam hone laga he
 An example of this was seen in the West Bengal assembly elections
 kolkata main kinnar samaaj ke log poling booth par logon kii madad karte najar aae
 Chennai is not easy the way of life now
 revatiko hi len
 She left the house as a teenager
 bheekh maangi or sex varkar tak raheen
 But in 1999, she joined Sangma, an organization working for sexual minorities, and started working for eunuchs
 unase ateet ke bare main poochne par unka dard ekadam se chhalak padataa he
 She says, "before joining the NGO, there was something to be done to stay alive
 '' lekin vah gujarey jamaane kii baat he
 He is now a well-known writer and activist
 unki do kitaaben- or livj or vadrs, teling aravanee lifestories or da truth ebout me publish ho chuki hai
 These books are also in the syllabus in many places, while the third book, The Story of Trans Women and Her Sons from Juban Padbrillers, is going to be published soon
 isamen ve aise logon kii baat karengi jinka sharir to aurat kaa he lekin man purushon vaala
 "everyone talks about male eunuchs," says Revathi, but male minds imprisoned in women's bodies are victims of neglect
 unke liye kinnar samudaay main bhi koi vyavastha nahin he
 She is working for the upliftment of eunuchs, and will soon attend the Literature Festival in London
 chennai kikalki subrahmanyamka safar bhi koi aasaan nahin rahaa
 Today he is an entrepreneur and also a Kinnar activist
 ladke kii tarah paidaa huin, lekin unamem ladki banane kii chahat thi
 In high school, parents put boys in school, their life became more difficult
 har koi unhen tang karata
 She began to be absent from school
 tabhi unki mulaakaat ek kinnar se hui
 In this way she joined the Kinnar community
 unhone dabl eme kiya or ek multinational company main media specialist ban gayi
 Later, she underwent gender change surgery
 apni pahchaan se jude ek dahala dene vaale haadase ko yaad karte hue ve bataati hai, ''main 13 saal kii thi
 One of my eunuch friends took seven men forcibly into an autorickshaw and raped her
 '' aaj unka brands kalki he jiske tahat ve vaadya yantra or wind chimes banaati hai
 He also has an institution named Sahodari
 ve 2011 main nartki film main kaam kar chuki hai or kavitaayen bhi likhti hai
 When asked about her struggle, she says, "my life has not been easy because of the gender identity crisis
" mere sahpaathee mujhe chidhaate or mere sharir ko lekar bhi tanj kasate
 In college, i had to go through very bad ragging
 in kharaab anubhavon ne mujhe or majboot bana diya he
 He believes that until 15 years ago, eunuchs were viewed with bad eyesight and considered untouchable
 log unase darate the, ab yah najariya badal rahaa he
 She says, "this change is confined to cities right now
" ise gaanvon tak laana hoga
 Along with this, the acceptance of parents for eunuch children can change their life
 unhen ghar se baahar phenkane kii bajaae unhen shikshit karke paanv par khadaa karnaa chahie
 "their preparation is to open an old age home for eunuchs
" iske alaava ve filmein bhi banaaengi or ek media production company kaa head banane kaa bhi unhen ofer he
 From music to street corners, society is getting along, and acceptance is also there
 yashraj film kii vaai filmas ke head ashish patel ko bharat kaa pehla kinnar band banane kaa khyaal aayaa to unhone shamir tandon ke saath milakar is band ko banane kaa faisla kiya
 Shamir says, "now there is work for the Kinnar community
 hamane is band ko banane ke liye railway stesan or anya jagahon se khojbin shuru kii
 "then six kinnars Asha Jagtap, Bhavika Patil, Chandni Suvarnarkar, Fida Khan, Komal Jagtap and Raveena Jagtap were chosen and formed a six-pack band in January 2016
 is band ke 'ham hai happy' gane ko 18 lakh se zyada utyub hits mil chuke hai
 "music has no language, face or religion," says Ashish
 '' udhar, mumbai kii hi sadakon par wings travels ne humsafar trust ke saath milakar kinnar or algebiti samudaay ke driveron vaali seva shuru kii he
 For this, five drivers are undergoing training while one driver is also driving
 wings travels kirun khartakahate hai, ''hamaara uddeshy aise 500 driver taiyaar karnaa hai, or ham chahenge ki kuch samay baad ve naukari se aage badhkar chaalak maalak skin ke tahat aaen
 "politics, law and the eunuch community
 Shabnam Mausi is the first eunuch who was elected by the public and sent to the assembly
" ve 1998 main madhya pradesh ke shadol-anuppur jile ke suhagpur vidhansabha kshetra se chunaav jiti thim or 2003 tak is pad par raheen
 The story of Kamla Jan, who became the first Kinnar Mayor, is quite interesting
 ve 2000 main chunaav jitkar katni kii mahayor baniin
 But this seat was reserved for women
 jabalpur hycourt ne 2003 main unke chunaav ko radd kar diya
 The same thing happened with his name, Kamla Bua
 ve 2009 main sagar se chunaav jiti thim or mahayor baniin
 This seat was reserved for SC category women
 is vajah se court main chunauti di gai or kamala buaa ko 2012 main is pad se haath dhonaa padaa
 In this way, the biggest question for Kinnar society was identity
 lekin pahchaan kaa yah sankat 2014 main us samay khatm ho gaya jab april 2014 main supreme court ne third gender ko pahchaan de di
 In this way, no eunuch can be taken away from him
 tabhi to janvari 2015 main madhu kinnar ko chhattisgarh ke raigarh jile ke matadaataaon ne apana meyar chunaa to unke sir par kisi kanoon kii talwaar nahin latak rahi thi
 He had a distinct identity of his own
 raigarh main pali-badhin or uski ek-ek galiyon se waakif madhu aaj puure jazbe ke saath apane shahar ke liye kaam kar rahi hai
 Meanwhile, the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment has decided to go ahead with the Rights of Transgender Persons Bill, 2016
 bill ke draft ko antim rup dene ke liye kanoon mantralay ke paas bheja gaya he
 According to this law, if a eunuch is forcibly removed from a village or house, forced to remove clothes or paraded naked, or forced to beg or forced to be bonded, it is a punishable offense
 Will be imprisoned for two years and fine
 iske alaava, chunaav ayog ne kinnaron ko chhot de di he ki ve mata-pita kii jagah guru kaa naam likh sakate hai
 They are also exempted from proof of age and address
 is vajah se voter aaidi card banvaanaa aasaan ho gaya he
 The sex change operation has now become easier for them
 2011 kii janaganana ke mutabik, unki sankhya 4,87,203 bataai gai he
 However, ngos and other ngos reveal these figures even more
 mukaam abhi or bhi hai
 
 
 The eunuchs are making new strides, and many positive initiatives are coming up, which raise hope
 abhi or bahut kuch kiye jane kii jarurat he
 Anjali Gopalan, founder and social worker of Naaz Foundation, says, "change is good
" lekin har str par bhedbhaav mitaanaa hoga
 Even today, eunuchs do not get jobs
 skool main pareshaani aati he
 People look at him with strange eyes
 bina shiksha kuch sambhav nahin he
 "she emphasizes the strict implementation of the law as well as the law
" revati bhi samaaj ke badalane kii baat kahati hai, ''najariya badalanaa hoga
 Nobody gives room to eunuchs
 slam main cameraa miltaa bhi he to doguni keemat par
 People on the bus consider it a spectacle
 free sex ke liye tang karte hai
 
 
 People like Lakshmi, Kalki and Revathi are trying for these changes
 transgender vishay par bani film da danish girl (2015) main iner vegener apni patni se kahata he, ''roj subah main khud se vaada karata hum ki main puraa din purush banakar gujaaroonga
 But i think like Lily uski tarah khwab dekhtaa hum
 She is always here
 
 
 yah sharir meraa nahin he

 (input language) acchhee khabar haih israel or hamaas ke bich choti khooni jang kaa maujuuda daur jald hi khatm ho jayega, or jaisaa ki har jang kaa mizaaj hota he—aakhir main har kisi kaa ant ho jaataa he
 But there is also bad news
 vah yah ki banduukon ke shant hone ke shaayad kuch maheene baad hi phir donon ore se jang shuru ho jaaegi
 This is the third round of war in the last six years
 israel or hamaas ke bich baar-baar chhidaae vaale takaraav kii vajah is hakeekat main chhipi hui he ki baar-baar chhidaae vaali jang ke baad yudhviram se isaki jad khatm nahin hoti
 This keeps Israel occupied and the Palestinians in the occupied western shores and the Gaza Strip continue to inflict sorrow and sorrow, causing despair and frustration
 gaja pattee mushkilon se bhari jagah he
 It is a small area of 146 square kilometers
 yahaan aabaadi main ijapha bahut hi ascharyajanak dhang se hua he
 During the first arab-israeli war in 1948, the population here was just around 80,000, which has now increased to 18 lakhs
 gaja ke zyaadaatar log sharnaarthi hai, jo sanyukt raashtra (yuan) ke banaae aath sharnaarthi shiviron main rahete hai
 The Gaza Strip was under Egyptian control since 1949, but was captured by the Israeli army in 1967 in a six-day war
 aakhir 2005 main gajavasiyon ke updrav se tang aakar israel ke tatkaaleen pradhanmantri arial sheron ne gaja pattee se apni bastiyaan or fouj ekatarfa taur par hataa lee
 Even today, most knowledgeable people consider the Gaza Strip (along the western edge) to be the occupied territory
 yah sahi bhi he
 The Israeli army is not present in the Gaza Strip, but controls the entire area from outside
 samudr main uski nausena falstini machuaaron ko gahare samudr main machhlee pakadaaey nahin jane detii
 From the top his air force keeps an eye on the Gaza people and kills the fighters
 jameen par bhi gaja pattee main pravesh karne or baahar jane waalon par nigaah rakhi jaati he
 Israel's remote-controlled stance on the Gaza Strip peaked after Hamas' victory in the 2006 democratic elections eight years ago
 apane pados main ugrapanthi islamic gut ke ubharne se naaraaz hokar israel ne gaja pattee main aarthik nakaabandi kar daali
 He worked to make life difficult for the people of Gaza by cutting off the western shore and the rest of the world
 vahaan ke logon or hamaas kii sarkaar ke bich khai banane kii koshish kii
 He hoped that the people of Gaza, who were facing problems like this, would eventually break ties with Hamas
 israel kaa kabja lagaataar kadaa hota gaya, is kadar sakht ki vah gaja ke logon se yah tak kah saktaa tha ki unki rasoi main kya pakegaa (kai baar to israel ne gaja main pasta kaa pravesh band kar diya, sirf unhen chaaval khaane par majaboor kar daalaa)
 For some time, Israel's occupation was not as strong
 masalan, khaane kaa saamaan, nirmaan saamagree vagairah ko misr kii seemaa par khodi surangon or rafah kii seemaa se chori-chhipe gaja pattee laayaa jaataa rahaa he
 But Egypt's current rulers consider Hamas to be close to the Muslim Brotherhood, so the tunnels have been closed and movement has been stopped from the border of Rafah
 is tarah misr kii seemaa par pukhta chekasi or israel kii nakaabandi kii vajah se gaja ke logon kii jindagi behad mushkil ho gai he, or hamaas ke shashan kaa astitv hi sankat main pad gaya he
 The current war between Israel and Hamas was due to the kidnapping of three young Israeli settlers on the western shore by the Palestinians
 uske baad israeli fouj kaa achaanak hamalaa unhen khojane or falstiniyon ko sabak sikhaane ke liye tha
 The Israeli army beheaded Hamas (which Hamas flatly denies) and arrested thousands of its western side activists who had nothing to do with the kidnapping of the three Israelites
 hataasha main hamaas gaja pattee se israel par rocket daagne laga
 He deliberately waged a fight in the hope that it would break the blockade of Israel (and Egypt) from the Gaza Strip
 in hamalon se kisi kii jaan nahin gai
 (palestinians burying the bodies of children killed in Ezrael) Hamas's actions against Israel did not have an absurd idea
 pashchim asia is vakt ‘arab spring’ kii vajah se badi uthal-puthal ke daur se guzar rahaa he
 There are dramatic changes in the maps drawn by the British and the French during the First World War, so the issue of Palestine can be forgotten if the Palestinians fail to attract attention
 is tarah, falstini agar aazaadee kaa sapana dekhte hai yaa israel kii nakaabandi se mukt hona chaahate hai to unhen harakat main aana hoga, kyonki unhen aazaadee yaa gaja pattee kii nakaabandi se mukti koi tashtaree main rakhkar to degaa nahin
 But firing a rocket at Israel was really a big mistake
 israel kaa jajba goli ke badale goli daagne or jaan ke badale jaan lene kaa he, jise falstiniyon se behatar shaayad hi or koi jaanata hoga
 The Israelis respond to the attack with a hard attack and their army is tremendous and extremely aggressive
 falstiniyon kaa israeli kabje ke khilaaf 1987 se 1993 tak chalaa pehla ahimsak andolan intifada behad kaamyaab rahaa tha kyonki pathar phenk rahi auraton or bacchon ke aage israeli fouj laachaar ho gai thi
 His second intifada proved to be a blunder from 2000 to 2005, during which fidayeen squads were sent to Israel
 israeli fouj ne aasaani se unka sir kuchal diya
 Hamas' current plan to wreak havoc in the Israeli territories through rocket warfare and tunnels is also going to be the same as another failed intifada
 iskaa ant donon ore ke liye aansuon bharaa hi hoga
 But Palestine will certainly remain at a greater disadvantage
 main pichley 25 saal se vaise britain main rah rahaa hum, multah israeli hum, is naate main israel ke logon ke dimag ko bakhubi pard paata hum or jaanata hum ki kab ve aage badhenge or kab samjhaute kar lenge
 All in all i will do that the Israelis come out under pressure and i have been constantly encouraging the Palestinians in public debates to wage a non-violent intifada against the Israeli occupation
 yani vah karen jise main akasar ‘gandhi style kaa ahimsak sangharshya’ kahata rahaa hum
 If thousands of Palestinians march in the occupied territory on the road with flowers in hand, they can achieve more than they can fire rockets for Palestine
 philhal to fori taur par yahi karnaa chahie ki fouran gola-barood or khun-kharaba band ho, lekin dirghakaalik makasad yah hona chahie ki israeli kabje ko khatm karne ke tareeke talaashe jane chahie or ek aise samaadhaan kii ore baduya chahie jisamen falstin kii apni dharti ho
 This will surely make them happy and people full of joy do not fire rockets at neighbors

 india today open-sorce invastigeshan se pakistan kaa military propaganda plateform ISPR benakabpakistan ne 27 farvari ko jor-shor se daawa kiya tha, usne do bhartiya payalton ko bandhak banayapakistan ke jhuthe daavon kaa jahaan ant nahin, vahiin sach par pardaa daalane kii bhi wo lagaataar koshish karata rahaa he
 On February 27, Pakistan had loudly claimed that it held two Indian pilots hostage after a plane collided in the sky
 pakistan ke military propaganda pramukh major general asif gafoor ko is daawey ke kuch hi ghante baad baglein jhaankani padi thi
 Because the truth was that the second pilot was a Pakistani, whose F-16 aircraft was shot down by wing commander Abhinandan Current
 major general gafoor jis inter services public relations (ISPR) jaise kukhyat plateform ke survey-sarva hai, uskaa kaam hi pakistan kii ore se hataahat hone waalon kii sachai par pardaa daalate rahanaa he
 But India Today's open-source investigation has exposed many of ispr's secrets
 jaanch se saamne aayaa ki major general gafoor kaise apane hi khel main chook par chook karte rahe
 Please tell that date-wise data is being released on their behalf
 isamen duty nibhaate hue pakistani sainikon ke jaan dene kaa byora bhi shaamil hota he
 This data is also disseminated on ispr's social media platforms
 india today open-sorce invastigeshan ne pakistani sena ke thithivaar aankadon or usee kii ore se media main die gaye bayanon kaa milan kiya
 Surprisingly, a considerable difference was found between the two
 misaal ke liye 29 agast 2017 ko liya jaae, is taarikh ke ISPR record ke mutabik, niyantran rekha (loc) par ek pakistani sainik kii maut hui
 But the same information could not be seen in the statements released on the media of that day
 is din media main die bayaan main peshawar divijan main pakistani sena ke oparation kaa zikr to kiya gaya, lekin niyantran rekha par kisi jawan ke khone kii koi jaankaree nahin di gai
 According to ISPR date-wise data on the Line of Control on 26 August 2016, a Pakistani soldier lost his life, but open-source investigation revealed that the Pakistani Army issued two statements that day
 lekin kisi main bhi apane jawan ke khone kaa zikr nahin kiya
 In another similar incident, a Pakistani soldier was killed in Siachen on 29 July 2012, but ISPR did not issue any press statement that day
 ab 2017 par aate hai
 India Today's open-source Investigation did not match ispr's date-wise data and press statements of the same date
 ek taraf hataahaton kii baat maani gai or duusari taraf uskaa koi zikr hi nahin kiya gaya
 On every occasion, the day Pakistan suffered the loss of soldiers, on that day it shied away from accepting it
 jaanch main saamne aayaa ki kai varsh baad hi pakistan ne apane thithivaar data main un mauton kaa zikr kiya
 It does not end here
 india today croud-sorcd video se bhi pakistani military leadership ke dohare chehre saamne aae

 Local leaders were also seen mourning in the video
 lekin hairaani kii baat he ki hawaldaar saleem rajput kii maut jis taarikh ko hui us taarikh ko ISPR kii ore se jari media bayaan main maut kaa kahin koi ullekh nahin tha
 In a similar video in the Misa Keswal area of jhelum district, Pakistani soldier Basharat Hussain was shown handing out military honors
 bashrat hossain kii duty par beete maheene maut hui thi
 Gafoor's public statements in August did not mention Basharat Hussain's death

 As soon as the helicopter lands on the land of Begusarai, the new popularity of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) President Amit Shah as an election campaigner and his ability to attract the crowd at his behest is immediately visible
 2019 ke chunaav prachaar abhiyaan main is nirvachan kshetra main apni 254veen jansabha ko sambodhit karne ke liye ja rahe shah helicopter se baahar kadam rakhte hai or chaaron taraf maujuud jabardast bheed kii taraf dekhakar haath hilaate hai
 An echo of 'amit Shah Zindabad' and 'modi, Modi, Modi' is heard from the crowd
 car main baithkar sabha sthal kii taraf badhate hue unke kafile ko sadak ke donon taraf kaaryakartaaon or prashansakon kii bheed ne gher rakhaa he
 The commandos have to work hard to save them from the unruly mob that has turned into Shah's color as they descend from his car at the venue
 unke prati bheed ke is jabardast utsaah ko dekhakar hamaare dimag main sawaal kaundhta he ki bhaajapa ke ummidavaar or kendriya mantri giriraaj singh ke khilaaf bhartiya communist party (bhakpa) ke ummidavaar or jeenyu rajdroh ke mukademe ke aaropee kanhaiya kumaar begusarai seat se kya vaaki jeet rahe hai, jaisaa ki zyaadaatar media ne takreeban bhavishyavaanee hi kar di he?shah ke prati aisa utsaah or joardaar narebaaji pichley loksabhaa chunaav ke mukaable nai he
 In 2014, he was the general secretary in charge of bjp's Uttar Pradesh
 us vakt unhen pradhanmantri narendra modi ke saath bhaajapa ke shandaar pradarshan kaa pramukh shilpkaar mana gaya tha
 He was then made the president of the party, and then in 2017, the BJP led him to a landslide victory in the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections and thereafter he became an overnight national political figure — that is, a mass leader
 begusarai main jab unhone isi dharti ke laal mahaan rashtravaadi hindi kavi ramdhaari singh dinakar kii kavitaaon ke ansh padhe, jeenyu rajdroh ke maamle or kanhaiya kumaar kaa zikr kiya or phir us cheez par hamalaa bolaa jise ve 'tukade tukade gang' (jeenyu ke chaatr jinhone 2016 main bharat virdohi naare lagaae the) kehete hai, to bheed ne khushi or utsaah se pratikriya di
 Shah said, "on one side, it is a piecemeal gang that wants to divide the country and which Rahul Gandhi supports
 duusari taraf, umr abdulla hai jo desh main do pradhanmantriyon kii maang karte hai or rahul baba khamosh rahete hai
 "shah pauses for a while and then hears a series of questions:" Will you defeat these forces that want to break the country? " "will you vote for Giriraj Singh ji to bring back Narendra Modi?" The crowd repeats, "yes, yes, yes" and "modi, Modi, Modi"
 phir ve kehete hai: ''ham jabardast bahumat ke saath satta main waapas aa rahe hai par agar ham bhavishya main vipaksh main bhi rahe tab bhi ham desh kii ekta or akhandta ke liye apni aakhri saans tak ladenge
 We will never allow this country to be divided
 " unke bhaashan kii duusari theme lalu raaj (bihar main argedy-congress gathbandhan) ke saath modi-nitish raaj kii tulana he
 He says, "lalu Raj means Jungle Raj: appeasement even at the cost of casteism, corruption, national security
" bhaajapa-jad(you) kaa gathjod or modi ji kaa matlab he vikaas, nyaay, garibon kii chintaa, raashtra kii ekta or rashtriya suraksha ke saath koi samjhauta nahin
 "then Shah asks," Who do you want? " The immediate response from the crowd comes 'modi, Modi, Modi'
 dopaher kaa vakt he or paara takreeban 40 degree ko chhu rahaa he, phir bhi bheed jabardast he or josh se bhari he
 In Ujiarpur, from where bjp's Bihar chief Nityanand Rai is contesting, Shah starts by taunting Rahul Gandhi with stating how much Modi has given to people in terms of development: "55 years of misrule" Despite those who never gave their accounts, today they are asking us for their accounts
 rahul baba hamen aapako hisaab dene kii jarurat nahin he
 But yes, it is our duty to give accounts to the people
 paanch saal main hamane logon ko aath karod shauchalay, garibon ko ujjwala yojana ke tahat saat karod rasoi gas ke kit die hai
 And Ayushman Bharat Yojana is giving free treatment of liver, heart, kidney and other serious diseases to 50 crore poor and lower class people
 or is sabase badhkar hamane centre main ek paardarshee or saaf-suthri sarkaar di he
 "after finishing the meeting, he hurriedly says to one of his assistants while boarding the chopper," i think the issue of national security is appealing more to the people with the mention of Pulwama and Balakot attacks
 " isiilie shah ke har bhaashan main rashtriya suraksha kaa gaharaai se zikr miltaa he, chaahe vah bihar kaa munger ho yaa uttar pradesh kaa gajipur, unnav or itawah ''mauni baba manmohan singh ke shashan ke dauraan pakistani hamaare javaanon ke sir katkar le jate the
 But when he attacked Uri in 2016, we responded to it with a surgical strike
 or jab unhone pulavama kiya to 56 inch ke seene vaale narendra modi ne pulavama katleam ke 13wein din aatankwaadiyon ke gharon main ghuskar aatankwaadiyon ke upar bambaari kaa aadesh de diya
 Now the rules of the game have changed
 ab goli maaregaa to yahaan se gola jayega
 When we taught the terrorists a lesson in Balakot, there was joy in every class, only Pakistanis and other congress-grand Alliance leaders were mourning
 "ek ke baad ek jansabhaon ko sambodhit karte hue unhen ehsaas ho jaataa he ki modi kii hawa chal rahi he
 Modi has become a symbol of every good thing, whether it is good governance or a good counterattack for security, and hence Shah leaves no stone unturned to take advantage of this Modi wave
 shah kii jansabhaon main garmi kii dupahari kii chilchilaati dhoop ke baavjood bheed kii taadaad, utsaah or josh dekhte hi banataa he
 On the strength of his passionate speech art, which he has just performed, Shah has emerged as a mass leader
 party kaaryakarta unhen narendra modi ke baad sabase kaabil or nipun chunaav prachaarak ke taur par dekh rahe hai
 If we look at the content of his speeches, he emphasizes both national security and development
 shah ke bhaashan dene kii kala main jo ek or baat tarif ke kaabil he, vah yah ki josho-kharosh se bhare bhaashan dete hue bhi unhone mushkil se hi kabhi koi galati kii he
 As a speaker, he always has complete control and knows where to pull his legs back and where to fire with full force
 masalan, begusarai main shah or giriraaj singh donon ne bade joshilay bhaashan die, magar singh musalamaanon ko 'babar kii aulad' kehane kii galati kar baithe, haalanki baad main singh ke sahaayak ne india today se kaha ki ve keval kattar musalamaanon kaa zikr kar rahe the, aam musalamaanon kaa nahin
 This type of omission does not happen to Amit Shah
 balakot or pulavama par bolte hue ve saaf or dotuk baat karte hai, par maryaada kii lakeer kabhi nahin laanghte
 This is the reason why Shah has emerged as the most powerful campaigner for the BJP after Narendra Modi
 unhone kaha ki bharat vividhtaon se bharaa desh he or hamaare desh kii ekta or ekajutata kii raksha karnaa hamaari praathmik jimmedaari he
 To accomplish this, all countrymen have to protect the cow and do cow service
 is tarah kii seva se rashtriya sampatti badhati he
 It does not create problems for the country
 yahaan kai vikaas pariyojnaon kaa shubharambh karte hue pradhanmantri ne kaha, 'lekin farji gaurakshak desh or samaaj ko nasht karte hai
 We need to be careful with these people
 in logon ko dandit karne kii jarurat he
 Then we can take the country to new heights
 bhartiya janata party (bijepi) chhodkar congress kaa daaman thaamne vaale shatrughna sinha ne pakistan ke sansthaapak mohammad ali jinna kii tarif kii he

 dilli parents association kii ek artiai main aayaa he ki dilli ke 50 fisadi skulon ke paas fire enosi nahin he
 In response to this RTI sent to the Fire Department, a list of several well-known schools have come out which have not taken the NOC (no Objection Certificate) of the Fire
 jaane, kya he is enosi kaa matlab
 In what kind of danger are the children of the capital

 Aparajita says that the view of that educational institute of Surat has not yet blurred from the eyes of all of us
 us santhaan main aag lagane ke baad kis tarah bachche chauthi manzil se kud gaye the
 20 children died in the accident
 isi ke baad hamane dilli ke skulon kaa jayja lene ke liye ye artiai daali thi
 He said that news of fire in schools is being heard in Delhi on the same day
 isi ko dekhte hue dilli perents association ke mahasachiv harish mehara ne fire vibhaag main RTI lagaakar jaananaa chaha tha ki skulon main aag se bachane ke intjaam kis tarah ke hai
 In response to this, the frightening truth has come out
 aparajita gautam ne bataaya ki pehle jawaab main vibhaag ne laaparvaahee baratate hue jo aankade die the, unke anusaar to ye 70% skulon ke paas fire enosi nahin thi
 According to the figures of the Education Department of the Government of Delhi, where about 7000 recognized and unaccredited schools are running in Delhi
 uske mutabikeshthi ye khulaasa karti he ki 50% skool bina fire NOC ke chal rahe hai, inamen kuch nami skulon ke atirikt sarkari skool bhi shaamil hai

 unhone kaha ki unke paas aisa koi system nahin ki wo NOC expire hone se pehle kisi ko reminder bhej saken
 According to the officer, his department work starts after the fire
 yahaan tak ki vibhaag kisi ko dandit bhi nahin kar saktaa
 In such a situation, it seems that the Delhi Education Department and the Fire Department are waiting for some major incident in the school
 bina NOC ke chal rahe kai nami schooldilli parents association ne dilli main jo nami skool bina enosi ke chal rahe hai unki list bhi hamaare saath saajha kii he lekin ham use saajha nahin kar rahe

 ajtak ke panchayat madhya pradesh main kendriya gramin vikaas evam panchayat raaj or khanan mantrinarendra singh tomarsne shirkat kii
 The session was moderated by India Today group news director Rahul Kanwal
 is dauraan tomars nerahul gandhike shivbhakt avatar ko bhaajapa kii sabase badi safalataa bataaya
 According to Tomar, the BJP government in Madhya Pradesh or the country is working
 ham desh ko rajyon yaa varg main baantkar nahin dekhnaa chaahate
 It is not allowed to be reflected in any scheme
 sabake liye sarkaar kaam kare or sabko saath lekar chale
 The work that Shivraj ji has done to increase the growth of Madhya Pradesh is amazing
 dabl disit main vikaas dar rahi he
 Jabnendra Singh Tomars was asked that big farmers are getting rich in Madhya Pradesh, not small farmers and BJP is saying that production is increasing in agriculture? So he replied that the media should not divide the farmer or any class
 bijli, pani, bonus, sabsidi, beemaa kaa laabh chote-bade sabhi kisaanon ko miltaa he
 All farmers have grown
 madhya pradesh growth or kisaani main aage aa gaya he
 Aaj Tak wanted to know from the Union Minister that farmers are neither able to increase income, nor produce? In response, he said that our government has been trying to help everyone
 ajtak kaa sawaal tha ki madhya pradesh desh kaa chauthaa sabase garib rajya he
 Here the death rate of young children is the highest in the country
 ek vyakti 100 acre kaa kisaan he, vahiin doosraa 10 acre kaa kisaan he
 Why so? So Tomar told that the people of the village should do other work besides farming, grow more profitable crops
 empi sarkaar or centre sarkaar ne kai kadam uthaae hai
 Drip irrigation, food grains, etc
 are being provided
 sawaal tha ki madhya pradesh main gayanacologist, bacchon ke doctoron, primary healthcare main doctoron kii kami he
 There is a shortage of 81% doctors in the state
 
 The answer was- there is a shortage of doctors across the country including MP
 2003 main ek hajaar logon par ausat 7 doctor the
 There is no long-term medical college in the country
 para medical college nahin khule
 We are opening now
 mahilaon se judaa sawaal tha ki enciarabi ke data ke mutabik, madhya pradesh main har do ghante main ek mahila kaa rape ho rahaa he?kendriya mantri kaa jawaab tha ki madhya pradesh main kanoon vyavastha kii sthiti thik he
 Police immediately take action after the incident
 madhya pradesh pehla rajya he, jahaan rape kii ghatnaon par turant ection liya gaya
 Court sentenced to death within 6 months in seven incidents in the state
 # metoo se jude taaja maamle main jab poocha gaya ki madhya pradesh se rajyasabha saansad emje akbar ke khilaaf 10 mahilaayein shikaayat kar chuki hai? jawaab main tomars ne kaha ki akbar sahab kii safai nahin ai he
 The subject is moving unilaterally
 ek baar bayaan aa jaae, to main kuch kah saktaa hum
 He further said that Akbar saheb himself will speak on the matter
 agar anyaay hua he to nyaay bhi hoga
 His side should also be heard
 madhya pradesh main kisaanon kii aatmahatya ke maamalon par rahul kanwal ne poocha ki, hamaare paas kuch aankade hai jo loksabhaa, rajyasabha main rakhe gaye hai
 The reply came on March 20, 2018
 har 8 ghante main madhya pradesh kaa ek kisaan aatmahatya karata he
 Tomar's answer was that no farmer should commit suicide, it is the responsibility of all of us
 agar koi kisaan aatmahatya karata he, to uskaa koi ek kaaran nahin hota he
 On asking questions in the famous Vyapam case of Madhya Pradesh, Narendra Tomar said that the Vyapam scam is outdated
 chunaavon main ham jite to isse saaf hota he ki hamen clin chit mili
 He also said that CM Shivraj ji first investigated Vyapam
 jo log doshi the, ve aaj jail main hai
 The matter is over
 jo nirdosh hai, un par aarope madhne kaa koi matlab nahin he
 E-tendering is nothing like scam
 media main aane vaali har cheez sahi nahin hoti he
 During Rahul Gandhi's Congress rally in the capital of Madhya Pradesh, the poster and rally crowing Rahul Gandhi was said to be asked whether his government will come once again in the state, or will the condition remain slim? Tomar claimed that the Madhya Pradesh government Is doing good work
 congress kii raily ke dauraan shivbhakt rahul ke poster lage
 This is bjp's victory
 hamaari thinking kaa nateeja he ki rahul gandhi janeu pahanane lage hai

 bharat ke nausainik kulbhushan jadhav ko somvaar ko aakhirkaar consular acces (rajanyik pahunch) milane ja rahaa he
 Pakistan has announced this
 haalanki bharat ne saaf kar diya he ki use pakistan kii koi shart manjuur nahin he
 Last month, Pakistan decided to give diplomatic access to Indian citizen Kulbhushan Jadhav, according to a decision by the International Court of Justice (ICJ)
 is babat pakistan ne bhartiya ucchayog ko suchit bhi kar diya tha
 Pakistan Foreign Office was quoted as saying that Pakistan, following the icj's decision, has agreed to give diplomatic access to Jadhav 'as per Pakistani laws'
 18 july ko pakistan ne kaha tha ki usne jadhav ko isije ke faisle ke anusaar vienna sandhi ke tahat rajanyik pahunch dene kii baat kahi he
 He will give diplomatic access to an Indian citizen 'in accordance with Pakistani laws'
 isije ne pakistan ko jadhav kii maut kii sajaa par roak barkaraar rakhane ke saath hi use rajanyik pahunch dene kaa nirdesh diya he
 What is the condition of Pakistan, the emphasis of Pakistan is that when the Indian officials meet Jadhav, then someone who is expected to be from the Inter Service Intelligence Agency (ISI) is also present there
 iskaa matlab saaf he ki pakistan kulbhushan jadhav ke saath kisi bhi prakaar kii baatcheet par apni khufia agency kii nigaah rakhana chahta he
 On this, India says that 'it is examining the Pakistani proposal in view of the ICJ decision
 ' haalanki bharat ne saaf kar diya he ki isije ke kaayade-kanoon ke mutabik hi jadhav ke saath consular acces kii prakriya apanaai jaaegi
 Foreign Ministry spokesman Ravish Kumar has earlier said that the 'conditions' of Pakistan are being examined and tested and negotiations are continuing with Pakistan in this regard at the diplomatic level
 haalanki videsh mantralay ne sharton ke bare main vistaar se kuch nahin bataaya
 The last time you had to fudge, Kulbhushan Jadhav's mother and wife met Jadhav in Islamabad on 25 December last year
 pakistan videsh mantralay main hui is baatcheet main ek shishe kii diwaar ke aar-paar maa-bete kii mulaakaat hui thi
 Kulbhushan's mother and wife were treated badly by Pakistan
 meeting se pehle unke kapade badalawaae gaye
 Mangalsutra, bangles were removed
 iske alaava unke juute bhi vahaan par jabt karvaa liye gaye
 Pakistan had alleged that there was a chip in their shoes which is under investigation
 iske baad jail main band kulbhushan jadhav kaa ek video saamne aayaa tha
 The video of Kulbhushan Jadhav was released by Pakistan Foreign Ministry
 isamen kulbhushan kehete hue dikhe ki unhen pakistan jail main koi nuksaan nahin pahunchaaya gaya
 There was a lot of controversy over this fact that Kulbhushan Jadhav was pressurized by this matter
 pakistan ko bharat kaa javababhartiya videsh mantralay pakistan ko saaf kar chukaa he ki use 'tatkaal, prabhavi or bina kisi rukaawat' ke consular acces chahie
 In July this year, the ICJ at the Hague ordered Pakistan not to further delay consular access to India to Jadhav
 videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa raveesh kumaar ne ek media brifing main kaha, 'ham rajanyik channelon ke madhyam se pakistani paksh ke sampark main hai
 Based on the decision of the ICJ, we asked for immediate, effective and uninterrupted consular access
 ' unhone kaha, pakistani paksh se hamen jo pratikriya mili he, use dekhte hai
 India had sent a notice to Pakistan, in which it was said to almost reject Islamabad's conditional offer in giving consular access to Jadhav
 bharat ab bhi apane is stand par kaayam he
 What's the whole case Kulbhushan Jadhav (49), a retired Indian Navy officer, was sentenced to death by a Pakistani military court in April 2017 on charges of "espionage and terrorism" after which India turned to the ICJ
 march 2016 main jasusi ke aarope main hui purv adhikari kii giraftaar ke baad se hi pakistan ne bhartiya adhikariyon ko jadhav se milane nahin diya he

 On May 1, 2016, Calvary, the first conventional submarine of the Indian Navy in 16 years, landed in the Arabian Sea without a black shark torpedo

 ''pre May 2014, Money in Swiss Banks was ‘black’

 But now the IMF, like the rest of the world, did not trust Pakistan

 On this, Pakistan requested the IMF to give half the amount i
e
 6 billion dollars, but the IMF also did not agree on this

 Pakistan's new captain Imran Khan was very hopeful that the International Monetary Fund would get some relief
 magar, antarrashtriya birdari kii tarah antarrashtriya mudra kosh ko bhi pakistan par zaraa bhi aitbaar nahin rah gaya or jis 8 arab dollar yani kareeb 45 hazaar arab rupee kii ummid pakistan ne imef se lagaai thi wo chur ho gai
 The IMF is not taking the request that Pakistan sent to the IMF for bailout package
 kyonki apane tex collection ke maujuuda halaat ko lekar pakistan imef ko itminan nahin dilaa sakaa
 However, the expectation of the bailout package for Pakistan from the IMF was already low
 kyonki ek taraf to pakistan kaa niryaat manda padaa hua he to vahiin duusari taraf imran kaa mulk gardan takkarjamen duba hua he
 So the signs were already looking bad
 or abhi bhi iske sudharne kii ummid bilkul kam he
 However, China and Saudi Arabia have assured financial assistance of $ 6-6 billion
 lekin arthshaastri maanate hai ki ye bhi makul nahin hoga
 The government of Pakistan, led by Prime Minister Imran Khan, is facing serious economic challenges
 uske liye arthvyavastha ko sanbhaalanaa lagaataar dubhar hota ja rahaa he
 Perhaps this is why after becoming Prime Minister, Imran Khan visited two of his most trusted partner countries
 or yahaan se unhen thodaa dhankos mili
 Both countries helped Pakistan with $ 6-6 billion
 haalanki china ne madad kii raashi bataane se inkaar kiya magar ye mana ja rahaa he ki china ne apane sadabahaar saathi ko aarthik sankat se nikaalane ke liye itani hi rakam kii madad kii he
 After assuming the throne, Prime Minister Imran Khan had said that he needed $ 12 billion to bail out the country facing economic crisis
 ab jab use apane mitra deshon se 12 arab dollar mil gaye hai tab bhi pakistan imef se chah arab america dollar kimangdobaraa kar saktaa he
 On one hand, angry with Pakistan's economic attitude, the IMF is hesitating to give loans
 vahiin duusari taraf pakistan soch rahaa he ki thodaa hi sahi magar use imef se lone mil jaae
 This is not the first time such a situation has arisen on Pakistan
 pakistan ke 70 saal ke itihaas main aise aarthik sankat usapar kai baar aa chuke hai
 And since 1980, Pakistan has taken bailout packages from the IMF 12 times
 philhal imef kii ek team maujuuda samay main chaalu khaataa ghate ko dhyaan main rakhte hue pakistan kii maudrik or rajkoshiya nitiyon ke saath-saath uski maudrik jaruraton kii samiksha kar rahi he
 It will be called the bigotry of Prime Minister Imran Khan
 kyonki jo imran pradhanmantri banane se pehle desh kii arthvyavastha ko sudhaarney ke liye is tarah ke kadamon kii mukhlafat kiya karte the
 He is now visiting the ghat-ghat for financial help and is also in the refuge of the IMF

 After the match was over, the cricketer would be in the field till about twelve o'clock at night and then when he left the field, he would be with the girls in the room
 kharid kar mangai gai ladakiyon ke saath
 With the girls whom Bucci used to send
 kya kijiega
 When the game played during the day becomes a night game, then behind this game, such games will start, which have no boundary
 srisanth or chandela sirf paison ke liye nahin balki ladakiyon ke liye bhi bike the
 Now, with the bat and ball in the ground, the fire and the courts will also be scattered, then the cricketers will have lost their minds
 par jin cricketron ko log role model maanate hon, jinaki log puja tak karte hai agar wo sadak chhap majanuun or plabvoy jaisi karte karne lagen to kya hoga? jaahir he vahi hoga jo ab ipel main ho rahaa he
 Pageant, spectacle and just spectacle
 match maidan par khelaa ja rahaa he
 But the commotion is happening outside the ground
 maidan ke andar kya ho rahaa he iske bare main to koi baat hi nahin kar rahaa he
 Talking is just out of the ground
 beyimaan khilaadiyon kii
 Over-solders of lenders
 spot phixing kii
 After the match was over, the players had colorful nights
 hani trep kii
 Of girls
 ab jaahir he jab maidan ke baahar itnaa hangaamaa barpa hoga to ipel kii surat or sirat kya naam bhi to badalegaa
 Hence people have started naming the IPL
 indian premier lig ko ab koi indian paap lig bula rahaa ho to koi indian piyakkad lig
 Well, it is already Indian money league
 yaad nahin aata ki cricket ko lekar isse pehle kabhi is kadar chhichhaledar hua hoga
 But why is this? Why is discussion outside the field more than the ground? Why are players making headlines for their antics outside the field instead of matches? Why are cricketers being caught red handed? Why is there a black spot of black money on Kiket? If someone comes forward in front of a site screen, the player's concentration starts to get disturbed
 par usee khilaadi ke saamne daaen-baayen boundry ke thik upar tamaam chirgirls naachati rahati hai par kisi khilaadi kaa cansantreshan bhang nahin hota
 Now you can tell who made the cricket field a spectacle? Hey brother maidan main log cricket match dekhne jate hai
 Those who are fond of watching dance can also fulfill their hobbies in gimmick or discotheque
 par nahin
 The brothers made the entire junk of cocktail of glamorous cricket with glamor
 or usee kii baangi hai hamaare ye khilaadi
 Those who were sold with money in the glare of this glamor and also killed by beauty
 khel kaa sauda kiya to paise jeb main aae
 With respect, the girls came close at stake
 par ye puraa khel hua kaise? srisanth or ajit chandelia ko buki ne fansaaya kaise? donon giraftaar ke vakt subah paanch baje kin ladakiyon ke saath the? un ladakiyon ko kisne donon ke paas bheja tha? aaj puraa khulaasa aapke saamne hoga
 On the night of May 15, when the Rajasthan Royals and Mumbai Indians match ended, the Delhi Police had the intention that they would arrest Sreesanth, Chandela and Ankit from Hotel Intercontinental late at night
 rajasthan kii team isi hotel main thahari hui thi
 But later the police came to know that Ankit is sleeping in the hotel but Sreesanth and Chandela are not in their room
 darasal donon buki kii bheji ladakiyon ke saath baahar the
 And both were still with them when they were caught
 or ab aapako milwate hai us cricketer se, jiske paas bukis ne teen baar ladkiyaan bheji thim
 Yes, this player is the biggest fixer of IPL
 naam he ajit chandila
 Rajasthan Royals spinner
 satorion ne ajit chandila ko 40 lakh rupye, ke saath ayyashi kaa package diya tha
 When Chandela was also arrested, he met the girl outside the team hotel at five in the morning
 aaie ab aapako bataata hum ki aakhir cricket main phixing ke liye buki ladakiyon kaa istemaal kyon karte hai? darasal betting sindicket sabase pehle aise khilaadiyon ko chunata he jinke bare main use pataa he ki wo bik saktaa he
 After this, the girls are quietly sent close to them in the name of the party
 ab ek baar khilaadi ladakiyon ke jhaanse main aayaa nahin ki gaya
 6 balls and 60 lakhs in 4 minutes
 sirf ek over main kismat badal lo
 Even if such fast pace of earning does not attract the players
 
 There were other tricks also near the Sattoris - offering girls
 tarika behad shaatiranaa tha
 Sattorees used to send girls to cricketers' parties
 ye ladkiyaan khilaadiyon se dosti banane kii koshish karatin
 If successful, Sattori would reach out to the players through girls
 ladkiyaan bhejne kaa phayda ye hota ki khilaadi sattorion ke saath khul jate
 Then neither the offer of fixing would be difficult nor to persuade them for this
 dilli police kaa daawa he ki bharat se ladakiyon kii supplai kaa jimmaa desh ke andar baithe buki kaa hota tha, jabaki videshi ladkiyaan dubai ke buki supplai kiya karte the 
 According to police sources, after the deal, the girls were usually accommodated in other hotels apart from the team hotel
 magar kai baar aisa bhi hua jab ladkiyaan usee hotel main bheji gayi jahaan khilaadi tehre the
 On May 15, the team of Rajasthan Royals stayed in Hotel Intercontinental in Mumbai
 lekin srisanth or chandela donon subah paanch baje tak hotel se baahar the
 With the girls
 jaahir he donon ke liye buki ne alag jagah intjaam kiye the
 Statues and paintings of Hindu deities are often depicted along with their rides
 bhagwaan ke har swaroop or unki sawari kaa apana mahatv or judaav he jiske peeche shastron main kai kathaon kaa bhi varnan kiya gaya he
 Chaitra Navratri is about to begin in a few days and these days nine forms of Maa Durga are worshiped
 maa durga tej, shakti or samarthy kii pratik hai or unki sawari sher he
 The lion symbolizes aggression and bravery
 yah teenon visheshtaayen maa durga ke aacharan main bhi dekhne ko milti he
 It is also interesting that the roar of a lion is considered to be the sound of Mother Durga, beyond which all the other voices of the world seem weak
 kya aap jaanate hai ki kyon sher maa durga kaa vaahan haior kya he iske peeche kii katha?agar aap nahin jaatne hai to aaie ham aapako bataate hai maa durga kii sawari sher se judi katha
 
 
 According to the first story, according to the mythological story, once upon a time Mount Kailash, Mother Parvati and Shivji were sitting together and joking with each other
 majaak main hi shivaji ne maa parvati ko kaali kah diya
 Mother Parvati felt very bad and she left Mount Kailash and went to the forest and she became engrossed in severe penance
 is bich ek bhookha sher maa parvati ko khaane kii ichha se vahaan pahunchaa, lekin vah vahiin chupchaap baith gaya
 Due to the influence of the mother, that lion also sat quietly with the mother doing penance there for years
 maa ne jid kar lee thi ki jab tak vah gori nahin ho jaaengi tab tak vah yaheen tapasya karengi
 Then Shiva appeared there and left the goddess with the boon of being a blonde
 phir mata ne nadi main snaan kiya or baad main dekha kii ek sher vahaan chupchaap baitha mata ko dhyaan se dekh rahaa he
 When Goddess Parvati came to know that this lion had been sitting here with her for a long time in austerities, Mother was pleased and made her her vehicle as a boon
 tab sema parvati kaa vaahan sher ho gaya
 According to the second story, there is another story in this relationship, which is mentioned in the Skanda Purana
 iske anusaar shiv ke putr kartikeya ne devasur sangram main daanav tarak or uske do bhai singhmukham or suraapdaman ko parajeet kiya
 Singhmukham apologizes to Karthikeya on his defeat which makes him happy and turns him into a lion and blesses him to become the vehicle of Maa Durga
 jaise-jaise ye saal khatm hone kii ore bad rahaa he, vaise-vaise car dilers agle saal ke nae modelon ko jagah dene ke liye apana stock clear karte ja rahe hai

 Rajnath Singh's words were surprising, but he too would not have guessed that in the evening of his disinterested attitude, Vasundhara Raje's affidavit on which he is signed may be overwhelming
 abhi tak bijepi yahi kah rahi thi ki jo bhi dastauez saamne aayaa he us par dastakhat nahin he
 Lalit Modi said that there is a signature

 This time the entire document has been revealed

 But now Vasundhara is Raje's signature
 vasundhara ne yah halafanama lalit modi ko landan kii residency lene ke liye diya tha

 Smriti Irani, while contesting the Lok Sabha elections in 2004, stated in her affidavit that she passed her BA from the correspondence school of Delhi University in 1996, contested the Rajya Sabha elections in 2011 and said BA Commerce Part One
 2014 ke halafname main kaha ki dilli vishvavidhyalay ke skool of open larning se bikom part van kiya he

 Importantly, even after the 2004 case, the court did not consider it outdated and accepted for hearing

 26 may ko kendriya mantri ke rup main shapath lene se 16 din pehle supreme court ne maharashtra ke maamle main ek faisla diya tha
 Thane district MLA Kishan Shankar Kathore, in his October 2004 affidavit, did not provide details of the outstanding electricity bill, bungalow and share in wife's name
 kathore sahab pehle hoicourt main haare phir supreme court main
 His membership was gone

 The Supreme Court said that in such cases, when it is proved that information was not given or incorrect information was given or complete information was not given, it would be presumed that the nomination was not accepted correctly
 chunaav ayog kii taraf se bahes karte hue minakshi aroda ne sahi kaha he ki aisi jaanch to baad main hi sakati he
 If it is found out earlier that the wrong information is given in the affidavit, then he cannot contest the election, so if he finds out later, his election can be canceled
 yahaan tak ki namakan bharte samay halafname main jaankaree nahin dene or khaali sthaan chhod dene ke bare main supreme court kaa ek faisla he
 In the 2013 case of Resurgence India v
 Election Commission, a decision was given that membership could be allowed if left vacant

 11 april 2005 kii ek report he hindu akhbaar kii
 The Supreme Court dismissed Subramanian Swamy's petition
 unki maang thi ki chunaav ayog sonia gandhi ke khilaaf shikaayat darj kare
 According to Swamy, in 2004, Sonia Gandhi misinformed about her educational qualification
 do jajon kii bench ne kaha tha ki sonia gandhi ne jaankaree nahin chhipaai ki unhone cambries vishvavidyadalay ke lenaaks kook skool se angreji main certificate course kiya tha
 Swamy claimed that Sonia Gandhi University had never registered in that institution
 laut kar aate hai phir se vasundhara raaje ke halafname kii ore
 Lalit Modi is openly tweeting that he has documents on his handle
 is halafname main vasundhara raaje ke dastakhat hai
 In this, what Vasundhara Raje has written, not only Vasundhara but now also questions the Prime Minister's silence even deeper
 tippaniyan Vasundhara has written that in the 2008 assembly elections, the Congress party had run a lot of misinformation against me and Lalit
 unhone mere mukhyamantri kaal ke dauraan ham donon par bhrashtachar ke kai bebuniyaad aarope lagaae
 But by then Lalit Modi's name had become famous in the house of India, but rather the world of the world had come to know
 ipel kii shandaar kamyaabi ke baad lalit kii safalataa ko cricket jagat ke puraane log or congress party ke netaa pachaa nahin paae
 By then Lalit was being touted as anti-congress and pro-bjp
 lalit modi baahar se twit kar rahe hai ki mere kilaaf arun jetali, ahamed patel or rajeev shukla kii tikdi jamaa ho gai he
 Lalit Modi has tweeted another that it seems that a channel has released documents by paying money
 abhi tak bijepi yahi kah rahi thi ki jo bhi dastauez saamne aayaa he us par dastakhat nahin he
 Lalit Modi said that there is a signature
 aap bhi dekhiye is dastauez ko
 This time the entire document has been revealed

 Now this is the same affidavit on which they are signed

 But now Vasundhara is Raje's signature
 vasundhara ne yah halafanama lalit modi ko landan kii residency lene ke liye diya tha
 When the Enforcement Directorate of India was searching for Lalit Modi
 kya ab bhi bijepi yaa modi sarkaar vasundhara raaje kaa bachaav kar sakegi
 Congress also did not delay
