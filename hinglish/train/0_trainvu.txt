 theth ganwai najar aane vaali mahilaon ko pinchis, pechkas or paane (lohe ke bolt kholane kaa upkaran) se handpump ko sudhaarte dekhakar kuch ajeeb lagata he, kyonki bundelkhand main is tarah ke najaare aam nahin hai
 This changed style of domestic women has given them a new identity and they are now called as 'handpump Wali Bai'
 madhya pradesh or uttar pradesh ke 13 jilon main faile bundelkhand kii pahchaan kam varsha or suukhaagrast ilaake kii he, yahaan khushhaal jindagi mensbase badi baadha pani kii kamirhi he
 At the government level, many plans were made to make this area watery, governments also made claims and a special package of seven and a half thousand crores came, but the situation remained the same
 yahaan ke logon ko bhale hi is package se kuch na mila ho, magar kai logon ke vaare-nyaare jarur ho gaye hai
 This is the reason that many people do not lag behind in making various efforts to save water at their level instead of staring at the governments
 madhya pradesh kaa ek jila he chhatarpur
 The water problem of this district of Bundelkhand region is the same as that of other districts
 varsh 1994 ke gajetir ke anusaar, is jile ke uplabdh aankade bataate hai ki varsh 1971 se 1983 ke bich ausat vaarshik varsha 982 millimetre thi, ab to yah aankada usase bhi neeche ja chukaa he
 Jhiriya Jhor is a small village in Chhatarpur district with confidence on its hands, in this village, backward, scheduled tribes and scheduled caste families are in abundance
 gaanv tak jane kii pakki sadak he, magar vipareet halaat se ladane kaa mahilaon main gajab kaa jajba he
 This is the reason why women who have once hesitated to leave the house have gone to the hand pump mechanic
 is gaanv main teen handpump hai, ve jab bigadate hai to yahaan kii mahilaayein sarkari amale kaa intjaar nahin karatin, balki khud use sudhaarney main jute jaati hai
 This is why no hand pump is bad in the hot summer and all the water is spilling out
 pani panchayat kii kaman mahilaon ke haathis gaanv main pani sangrakshit karne or bachaane kii jimmedaari mahilaayein sanbhale hui hai
 Women dominate the Panchayat
 pani panchayat kii adhyaksh puniya bai adivasee kahati hai ki beete chaar varshon kii koshishon se pani kaa jalastr badha he
 For this, women first tied the weir, made check dams, stopped water, cultivated and now the water level of the water bodies has increased
 puniya bai aage kahati hai ki pehle gaanv main lage handpump bighad jate the to ve pareshaan ho jaati thim, kyonki sarkari amala sunata nahin tha
 Only when he was pleased, did the hand pumps improve
 is sthiti main mahilaon ko parmarth samaaj seva samiti ne handpump sudhaarney kaa prashikshan diya
 As a result, the women of the village have become skilled mechanics today
 aas-paas ke gaanvon main bhi he jalawaapani panchayat kii sachiv seemaa vishwakarma gaanv ke badalte halaat or soch kii charchaa karte hue kahati hai ki gaanv kii mahilaayein pehle ghar se baahar nahin nikal paati thim, magar ab aisa nahin he
 The women have united for water and the picture has changed
 ek taraf pani ko sangrakshit kiya jaataa he, to duusari ore isaki barbaadi par bhi lagaam lagaai jaati he
 Not only this, women are improving hand pumps, they have started doing this work not only in the village but also in the nearby villages
 mil rahaa he pati or ghar se samarthanakllo bai kahati hai ki gaanv kii mahilaayein badal gai hai
 They did not hesitate to fight for their rights
 ab mahilaayein apana kaam karaane ke liye vikaas khand mukhyalay tak jane se nahin hichaktin
 The officers there fall behind and finally the officers have to listen to them
 pehle to pati bhi roka-toki karte the, magar ab aisa nahin karte hai
 Many women have to get support from home
 or bhi sakasham tathaa daksh banane par jorbundelkhand kii mahilaon main aa rahe badlaav ko rajya kii apper mukhya sachiv (adishnal chif secetry) aruna sharma sukhad maanati hai
 They say that it is not necessary to be educated to learn technical
 ve mahilaayein padhi-likhi bhale na hon, magar prashikshan ne unhen handpump sudhaarney main daksh kar diya he
 The government is trying to make women more competent and efficient by giving them technical training
 itihaas is baat kaa gavaah rahaa he ki bundelkhand kii mahilaon ne kabhi halaat se haar nahin maani he
 Whether it was the fight for freedom or the phase of struggle against the evils in the society, all the time women here have given iron
 ab pani ke sankat se jujhate is ilaake kii mahilaon ne pani ko bachaane or sabhi ko pani uplabdh karaane kii muhim chhedi he, jo kargar hoti najar bhi aane lagi he

 But in August last year, a teacher in South India expelled a 12-year-old student from the classroom simply because her clothes and seat were stained due to menstruation

 So the level of shame about this normal physical activity is of this level
 mujhe ummid he ki 'pedman' ke baad ladakiyon main shame kaa str kuch hadatak kam hoga

 Became a cabinet minister for the first time after winning elections in 2008
 inhen khaadh aapurti evam deyari mantri banaaya gaya
 Babulal's reputation as a crowd mobster in the Congress grew so much that in 2011, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhi started launching Aadhaar cards from Dudu
 jaipur main jab bhi koi bheed jutani hoti thi to mukhyamantri ashok gahalot inhi par nirbhar rahete the
 This was the reason that despite being called the most corrupt minister in the state, Gehlot could not remove them
 nagar gahalot sarkaar ke dalit cheharaa the or chunaav jitne ke liye sachin payalat bhi inke paas aate the
 The disputed Nagarbabulal Nagar has an old association with controversies
 sabase pehle nagar tab vivaadon main aae jab khud unki patni sunita nagar 2001 main unke khilaaf ek enjio main jaakar baith gai thim

 In 2011, it was alleged that with the help of NREGA money and laborers, Nagar got the road constructed for his farm house
 tab babulal ne bill chuktaa kar apana peechha chhudaaya
 After that a letter was written against Babulal to Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, which Gehlot sent to the Anti Corruption Bureau for investigation
 usamen unhe ye kehete hue clin chit de di gai ki shikayatakarta nahi mil rahaa he
 But after the reshuffle in the cabinet after the Mahipal Madrena episode, the Ministry of Food Supplies was taken away from them and given the Khadi Ministry
 lekin gahalot ke paas nagar ne guhaar lagaai ki khaadi lekar ve kya karenge, phir saath main deyari bhi de diya gaya
 Here, along with the chairman of Rajasthan Dairy and the chairman of the Khadi Board, citizens became famous because of the Chagadas

 The market share figures of smartphone companies have arrived
 inke mutabik bhartiya bazaar main top smartphone brands main samsung number-1 he
 While the second number is Chinese company Vivo
 tisare number par bhi chini company Xiaomi he
 Not only this, Chinese companies Oppo and Lenovo are also at number four and five
 in aankadon se saaf he ki in chini smartphone companiyon ko mila den to market share ke maamle main ye samsung se badi hai
 These top-5 companies together account for 70% of the handset marketshare in India, according to a counterpoint research firm
 top-5 main chaar companiyaan china kii hai
 The surprising fact is that in the Indian smartphone market, the number-1 and number-2 race is a competition of Chinese and Korean company
 ek taraf south korean company samsung he jo lagaataar number-1 he duusari taraf chini companiyaan oppo, vivo or van plus hai jo kamobesh ek hi parent company ke andar aati hai
 According to GSK report, the Chinese company Vivo 2% to 15% in terms of sales and brand awareness in just two years
 49 fisadi kii badhotaree hui he
 The company entered India in 2014 and has now become the second largest smartphone company in the country
 BBK Electronics kii sahaayak companiyaan hai Oppo, Vivo or oneplus!shaayad aapako yah pataa na ho ki Vivo, Oppo or oneplus teenon smartphone companiyaan ek hi parent company ke andar aati hai

 While oneplus is also part of BBK Electronics
 bhartiya bazaar main chini or korean company kii takkar ho rahi he, lekin inamen bhartiya smartphone companiyaan kahi res main hi nahin hai
 In just 2 years, Vivo, Oppo and Xiaomi have dominated the Indian market

 is company kaa market share 15
 2 per cent while 10 in the last quarter of 2016

 philhal company kaa market share 9
 1 per cent while 7 in the last quarter of 2016
 56 fisadi hi tha
 Talking about Xiaomi, it has knocked in the Indian market in 2014
 lekin halaat yah he ki ab Xiaomi desh kii sabase popular smartphone company he
 Its market share has been 10 percent in the last year
 chini or south korean companiyon kii res main micromax jaisi badi bhartiya smartphone companiyaan dhire dhire chart se khisak rahi hai
 In the last year itself, Micromax has gone down from the top-5 rank in India
 sirf chaar chini smartphone companiyon – Xiaomi, Vivo, Oppo or Lenovo ke aankade ko dekhen to bharti smartphone market main in companiyon kabja 40
 3 percent
 chini kapani Itel kul handset share ke maamle main number-2in sab ke alaava duusari chini company jaise –itel bharat ke feechar phone bazaar main teji se paanv pasaar rahi he
 You will be surprised to know that the Chinese company itel whose name you may not have even heard has become the second largest company in the total handset market share of India
 counter point research ke mutabik iskaa market share 9 fisadi he jabaki micromax kii share 8 fisadi hi he
 Apart from these top players, companies like Gionee, Coolpad, leeco and oneplus are becoming increasingly popular and gaining market share
 aise main bhartiya companiyaan jaise- lava, micromax or intex jaisi companiyaan lagaataar neeche khisak rahi hai
 And in the coming time, there is no possibility of rising above them

 12% sampatti thi
 It is less than 10% which is valid
 andhra pradesh sarkaar to inakam se 20% zyada property hone par bhi use jaij maanati he, kyonki kai baar hisaab badha-chadha kar pesh kiya jaataa he
 For the property purchased, the accused had taken a big loan from the nationalized banks
 loar court ne is par vichaar nahin kiya
 It also does not prove that the immovable properties were purchased with black money
 nichali adaalat kaa faisla kamjor tha

 a pregnant woman suffering from swine flu admitted at Kasturba Hospital in Mumbai died on Sunday
 mahanagar main is beemaari se ab tak 8 logon kii maut ho chuki he
 Jayaraj Thanekar, public health officer of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), who was on the ventilator, said that 21-year-old Pushpa Chaudhary, a resident of Thane district, was admitted to the hospital on August 21
 use ventilator par rakhaa gaya tha
 The outbreak of the flu continues
 "the woman died on Sunday morning
" use behad gambheer haalat main aspataal main laayaa gaya tha
 She was seven months pregnant

 However, we could not ascertain if he had any other disease
 ’’ puspa kaa isse pehle thane ke vineet aspataal main ilaaj kiya gaya tha
 He was later admitted to Kasturba Hospital
 gauratlab he ki sarkaar or sthaneey prashasan kii tamaam koshishon ke baavjood flu kaa prasar jari he
 Pranab Mukherjee, who is looking after the finance minister, may have a zero budget, but it seems that the government is worried about the general public's disappointment
 yahi vajah he ki sarkaar ne mangalvaar ko sarvice tex main do fisadi kii katautee kaa elaan kar diya
 Till now, the government used to charge 2 percent education tax and 1 percent secondary education tax with 12 percent service tax, which was 12 in total
 36 fisadi padataa tha lekin ab kul vasuuli 10
 3 percent will be 2
 06 fisadi kii kami
 The scope of service tax includes stock broking, couriers, air travel agents, car rentals, architects, insurance and real estate agent commissions etc
 iske alaava sarkaar ne exise duty kii chhot ko bhi 31 march ke baad bhi jari rakhane kaa elaan kiya he
 The excise duty was reduced by four per cent in the second relief package announced by the government in December
 power sector ko raahat dene ke liye nophtha ko custom duty se mil rahi raahat 31 march ke baad bhi jari rahegi
 Duty cuts are being considered as the third relief package by the government
 pranab ne antarim bajet main jab apana pitara kholaa tha to wo khaali niklaa tha
 But the duty cuts have given the corporate world a chance to smile along with the common man

 haal hi main hue cabinet badlaav main pradhanmantri narendra modi ne rail mantri ko to badal diya he, lekin railway kii sthiti badalati nahin dikh rahi
 On Thursday, there were four rail accidents in a single day
 haalanki in haadason main kisi kii maut kii khabar nahin he
 If we talk about the last one month, then there have been 7 railway accidents during this period
 baavjood iske rail suraksha ko lekar koi gambhir koshish jameen par nahin dikhti najar nahin aati
 Piyush Goyal had also taken over as the new Railway Minister that four rail accidents took place in a single day
 in haadason ko lekar guuruuvaar shaam rail mantri ne meeting bhi bulaai
 Where rail safety was reviewed
 ye bhi padhein : piyush goyal ko mila kaanton bharaa taj, kya lautaa paaenge railway par bharosa?pehla haadasagruuvaar kii subah rail haadason kii shuruyaat upi ke sonbhadra jile se hui
 Here 7 coaches of Shaktipunj Express derailed
 train haavda se jabalpur ja rahi thi
 The incident took place in Phaparakund area of obra police station area
 bataa den ki train sankhya 11448 HWH-JBP shaktipunj express ne obra cabin subah 6

 is train main kul 21 dibbe the
 After the second accident, Ranchi Rajdhani Express train fell victim after the accident
 dilli ke shivaji brij ke paas ranchi rajdhani express patari se utar gai
 The engine and power car of the Ranchi Rajdhani Express derailed
 haalanki, is haadase main sabhi yatri surakshit rahe
 Third accident, another major rail accident in UP stopped
 farrukhabad main ek noujvaan kii samajhadaari ne is haadase ko taal diya
 Actually, the Fatehgarh track of Farrukhabad was cut off, when a young man named Pawan showed his red vest and stopped the Kalindi Express
 kaha ja rahaa he ki jahaan par patari kati hui thi, vahaan se 4 trainen guzar chuki thim
 After the train stopped many railway officials reached the spot and the repair work was started
 chauthaa haadasagruuvaar shaam ko maharashtra main khandala ke kareeb ek malgadee ke 2 coach patari se utar gaye

 After this, it can be expected that the government will take serious steps towards rail safety at its level and make the railway safe
 congress netaa shashi tharur kii patni sunanda pushkar kii maut ke maamle main chaunkaane vaali jaankaree saamne ai he
 The latest report submitted to the police of a committee of doctors of AIIMS has stated the cause of death as poison
 is report ko un teen doctoron ke panel ne banaaya he, jinhone sunanda pushkar kaa postmortem kiya tha
 Also, cfsl's report has also been made the basis for the report in which Sunanda Pushkar's viscera was investigated
 doctoron kii team ne ek baar phir nishkarsh diya he jaisaa usne apni pehali report main diya tha ki unka gurda, jigar or hriday saamaanya tareeke se kaam kar rahaa tha or unki maut jehar se hui
 The new report was submitted to the police nine days ago
 march main siefel ke visra report main sanket drug vishaaktata kaa sanket diya gaya tha, lekin police ne ise adhuraa mana tha
 He then asked AIIMS to test the report again and give its findings
 teen sadasyeey team ne ab ‘aagaamee medical board opinian’ 30 sitambar ko police ko saunpi he
 Sunanda was found dead on January 17 at a Panchsitara hotel in South Delhi
 isse ek din pehle pakistani patrkaar meher taraar ke saath unka twitor par tharur ke saath unke kathith prem sambandhon ko lekar jhagada hua tha
 The investigation of the case was handed over to the Crime Branch on 23 January
 haalanki, do din baad 25 janvari ko maamle kii jaanch phir se dakshin jila police ko saunp di gai thi
 (also from the input language) uttar pradesh sarkaar dwaara faijabad jila adaalat main visphot ke aaropee khalid mujahid ke parivaar ko chah lakh rupee muaavja die jane ko chunauti dete hue somvaar ko elahabaad ucch nyaayalay kii lakhanu khandpeeth main ek rit yachika daayar kii gai
 Several petitions filed by social activist Nutan Thakur stated that since Khalid is still a terrorist in government records, he was accused of a serious terrorist incident
 at: use maut ke baad muaavja nahin diya janaa chahie tha
 Compensation to the terrorist's family is contrary to the written preamble and fundamental duties in the Constitution
 thakur ne is maamle main tatkaal ek avkaash praapt ucch nyaayalay ke jaj se jaanch karaaye jane kii maang kii he ki khalid ko sahi pakadaa gaya tha athwa vah nirdosh tha
 If he is implicated innocent then he should have legal action against the officers who did so with compensation, but if the investigation finds that Khalid was not framed innocent and was actually involved in this misdeed, then compensation is recovered from his family
 Go beete saptaah faijabad jila adaalat main peshi ke baad police abhiraksha main lakhanu jail le jaae rahe khalid kii barabanki main tabiyat bighad gai, jiske baad use aspataal main bhartee karaayaa gaya jahaan uski maut ho gai
 The Akhilesh government on Sunday announced a compensation of Rs six lakh to Khalid's family
 agava kiye gaye chaar police consteble 29 june ko jab paidal chalakar jharkhand ke khunti jile ke psico thana pahunche, tab police ke bade afasaron ke paas is baat kii koi safai nahin thi ki pehle keval teen police waalon ko adivasee bheed ke haathon bandhak banaae jane kii baat kyon bataai gai thi
 These constables were abducted from the house of BJP MP Karia Munda by a mob of over 100 people agitating for Pathalgadi
 yah karrwai ghaghara gaanv main hui un jhadpon ke baad kii gai thi, jahaan police ne 19 june ko paanch mahila saamaajik kaaryakartaaon ke saath samuhik balaatkaar ke aaropee chaar adivaasiyon kii talash main chhapemari kii thi
 There is apparently a serious lack of information in the way the state government is dealing with the Pathalgadi movement
 pracheen patthalgadi panrapara ke mutabik purakhon kii kabron par pathar kaa khambha lagaaya jaataa he
 But since August 2017, tribal leaders of more than 100 villages in the Munda areas have been putting stones at the mouths of the village — inscribed with the rights of tribals
 ye us sarhad kaa kaam bhi karte hai jise langhane kii ijaajat police, prashasan ke afasaron or gaiyr-adivaasiyon ko nahin he
 While the leaders of the Pathalgadi movement claim that the tribal region of Jharkhand is an independent 'dishom' (nation), the Raghubar Das government has failed to include them in the negotiations
 badhate avishvaas kaa ek vibhats nateeja samuhik balaatkaar tha
 According to police, the incident confirms Maoist links with the movement
 ek peedita ne yon hamale se pehle apane phone par ek aadmi kii tasviir clic kar lee thi, jo maovadiyon se alag hue ek dhade piples libration front of india ke aria commander baaji samad urf takla kii thi
 According to BJP sources, Das is also reluctant to include tribal leaders of his party in the talks
 iske peeche unki ‘asuraksha’ kii bhaavana he
 BJP leader Arjun Munda has been the Chief Minister three times and is a strong leader of the Vemunda community
 afasaron kaa maananaa he ki arjuna munda khunti ke masale ko sulajhane main sabase behatar sabit ho sakate hai
 But they are also seen as a possible challenge to Das, so the state government does not want to involve him in this issue
 sirf naagarik prashasan or police ke jariye hi sarkaar kaa adivaasiyon ke saath sampark he, jo kargar sabit nahin ho rahaa
 Initiatives like Adivasi Jan Utthan Abhiyan have also not achieved much success
 ek varisht police afasar kehete hai, ‘‘sarkari afasar na to sthaneey jabaan jaanate hai or na hi adivaasiyon se koi judaav rakhte hai
 In such a situation, to expect that they will solve this issue is to be overly optimistic

 Read- Judiciary: The cases of prisoners who have been looking for justice for 10 years will be heard prominently under the Unaided scheme of justice
 aankadon ke mutabik, aise maamalon main desh kii 1387 jelon main kareeb 28 xxrep 4 0 log kaid hai
 The number of prisoners under consideration is two-thirds of the total number of prisoners in the country
 kai ke paas vakil karne ke liye bhi nahin he paisedesh kii jelon main kshamta se zyada kaidi bhare hai
 Case files are buried in the courts
 ek-ek cese kaa faisla hone main saalon lag jate hai
 Many times it happens that the accused are so poor that they do not even have money to advocate

 On the one hand, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal is engaged in strengthening the Anti Corruption Branch
 bhashtrachaar ko khatm karne ke liye helpline jari kiya he
 So that they can carry on the fight against corruption
 lekin ye daawey khokhale pad jate hai jab unke aalaa adhikari bhrashtachar ke aaropon main ghire najar aate hai or sarkaar unke khilaaf jaanch ke aadesh dene se saaf inkaar kar detii he
 Till date, only the documents that are on hand are telling this
 dilli sarkaar ke anti karpshan vibhaag ne 2013 main karodon rupee ke transport vibhaag ke ghotaalon kaa pardaafash kiya
 The scam is about fitness testing of commercial vehicles
 is silsile main 2006 se lekar 2013 tak ke anti karpshan vibhaag ne shila sarkaar ke raaj main transport vibhaag ke chote adhikariyon ko giraftaar bhi kiya lekin jab bade adhikariyon par haath daalane ke liye usne sarkaar se anumati maangi to us darkhwaast ko manaa kar diya
 Complainant Vivek Garg says, "despite having so much evidence, the Delhi government is not ordering charge sheets in it
 ’anti karpshan vibhaag lagaataar dilli sarkaar se guzarish karata rahaa he ki use dilli ke purv mukhya sachiv pi ke treepathi or maujuuda mukhya sachiv di em sapolia se is maamle main poochtacha kerani he
 Apart from this, former Transport Commissioner r Chandramohan, former Transport Commissioner RK Verma, former Additional Transport Commissioner RP Meena, Joint Transport Commissioner VK Gupta, former deputy transport commissioner Ashok Gupta, former deputy transport commissioner, deputy commissioner M
 Sharma Sharma And Deputy Transport Commissioner J
P
 Rma be allowed to charge sheet but the government tried to cover up the whole affair
 shikayatakarta vivek garg ne kaha, ‘arabon rupee ke is ghotaale kii jaanch puri ho chuki he or apni ek saal kii jaanch ke hisaab se anti karpshan is maamle main chargeshit daakhil karnaa chaahati he lekin ye jaanch ghoosekhori or dhokhadhadi ke aaropon ko adaalat main sabit hi nahin kar paaegi kyonki maamla dilli sarkaar ke aalaa adhikariyon se judaa he or sarkaar chup he
 If charges of bribery were leveled against a common man, then what would have happened to him
 ’ The political situation of the Delhi Assembly elections is being set
 aam aadmi party ke sanyojak or dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ek ke baad ek loklubhaavan ghoshnaaen kar apane siyaasi kile ko durust karne main jute hai
 At the same time, the path of bjp's return to power in Delhi rests on the graph of Congress
 aise main bijepi kii ranneeti he ki loksabhaa chunaav main congress kaa dilli main badha graph kisi bhi surat main kam na ho
 Let us know that the graph of Congress and BJP has increased in the Lok Sabha elections in Delhi, while the vote percentage of Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has come down, due to which the Congress has moved from third to second place
 iskaa phayda yah hua ki bijepi dilli kii sabhi saaton loksabhaa siten jeetne main kaamyaab rahi
 So that the Congress's base is saving, if we look at the result of Lok Sabha elections, the Aam Aadmi Party's support base is slipping 14% in 2019 as compared to 2014
 AAP ko dilli main 18
 11 percent votes have been received, while 7 percent of the Congress and 10 percent of the bjp's base has increased in Delhi
 congress ko 22
 It got 51 percent votes, but it could not win a single seat
 vahiin, bijepi 56
 With 56 per cent of the vote, it managed to win all the seven seats
 sutron kii maane to bijepi kii koshish he ki congress kaa jo janaadhar loksabhaa chunaav main badha tha, use kisi bhi keemat par use kam nahin hone diya jaae
 If the strength of the Congress will be benefited, according to the BJP sources, Delhi's Assembly elections can be won only by keeping the Congress alive
 is lihaaj se bijepi apni ranneeti ko amali jama pehanaane main juty he
 The BJP is busy in keeping the Congress alive by any pretext
 bijepi ranneetikaron kii maane to congress jitani majboot hogi, utani hi aam aadmi party ko nuksaan hoga
 Inwardly will help Congress! In such a situation, BJP will get direct benefit in the coming elections
 haalanki, bijepi ranneeti ke tahat aam aadmi party par sidhe hamale karne ke saath-saath congress ko bhi apane nishane par legi
 This will send a message that there is a Congress against it
 itnaa hi nahin, sutron kii maane to loksabhaa chunaav main congress ke paale main aae aam aadmi party ke votaron ko congress ke saath jode rakhane main bhi bijepi ne andruni taur par madad karne kaa plan banaaya he
 Actually, the bjp's voter in Delhi remains with him, whereas the Congress voter has gone with the AAP, due to which Kejriwal has occupied Delhi's power
 vahiin, is baar ke loksabhaa main AAP kaa voter kejariwal se chhitakkar congress kii taraf lautaa he, jise bijepi chaahati he ki vah congress ke saath judaa rahe
 Looking at the 2013 Delhi Assembly election results, the BJP won 31 seats with 33 percent votes, while the Aam Aadmi Party won 29
 5 fisadi vot ke saath 28 siten mili thi or congress ko 24
 It won 8 seats with 6 percent of the vote
 lekin, 2015 main vidhansabha chunaav ke nattejey ko dekhen to congress kaa vot kejariwal ke saath shift ho gaya he
 The result of this was that Aam Aadmi Party 54
 3 fisadi ke saath 67 siten jeetne main kaamyaab rahi, jabaki bijepi ko 32
 Got 3 seats with 3 percent
 vahiin, congress mahaj 9
 Coming on 7 per cent of the vote, it was reduced to zero
 isse saaf samajha ja saktaa he ki dilli main congress or aam aadmi party kaa voter ek hi he
 This is the reason that in the upcoming Delhi Assembly elections, where Kejriwal is trying to bring back his slipped mass base, the bjp's strategy is to keep the Congress's graph strong

 The Shiv Sena has targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi in its mouthpiece Saamna, citing the example of the new President of America Donald Trump
 darasal trump ne america main chunaav se pehle logon ko aashwaasan diya tha ki america nagarikon kii jagah videshi karmchaariyon ko praathamikta nahin di jaaegi
 Which he has now announced to be implemented
 unka ye bayaan hindustan ke liye chintaa kaa vishay ban gaya he
 The Shiv Sena has also said that the way Trump has thought in the interest of the citizens of his country, can the Aisamodi government also take such a step for Pakistani artists
 pakistani kalakaar bharat main paisa kamaane aate hai
 The world calls Trump a fool, but if he can take good steps for his country to protect the country with his understanding, can the Modi government not do this? India will suffer the biggest blow of Trump's action
 isse kai bharatiyon kii america se chuttee ho sakati he

 It may be noted that before beginning his tenure, he has started preparations for the assurance given by Trump to please his citizens
 kaha ja rahaa he ki trump ye kah chuke hai ki ech-1 bi vija waalon ko america main naukari nahin karne diya jayega
 Let us tell you that H-1B visa is one that is issued to foreigners to come to America to benefit from their specialty
 gauratlab he ki trump ne kaha he ki america logon kii rojgaar suraksha unki praathamikta he or ve america logon kii jagah videshi kamgaaron ko naukari par rakhe jane kii anumati nahin denge
 The companies 'hawala trump cited Disney World and other US companies where other foreigners who came to the US on H1-B visas, including Indian workers, snatched up Americans' jobs
 vija kaa mudda trump ne chunaav prachaar ke dauraan bhi pramukhataa se uthaaya tha or kaha tha america logon kaa rojgaar ve kisi or desh ke logon ke liye chhinane nahin denge
 Trump was among thousands of supporters in Jorowa in an election campaign that said he would fight to secure the lives of every American
 trump ne aage kaha, 'campan ke dauraan maine un america kamgaaron ke saath bhi vakt bitaayaa jinhen un logon ko prashikshan dena padaa tha jinhen baad main unheen kii jagah naukari par rakhaa gaya
 Foreign workers were brought in to remove them

 In the second phase of adolescence, hope also seems to be very big ambitions

 The sexual relationship was more confidential as a result of before or after love
 shammi ne pyaar ko masti ke jhtke ke saath antarangta se aise alag kar diya jisase yon sambandh kii uttejnaa kaa spasht sanket miltaa tha
 By the way, this covenant had a security condition attached to it: fun or fickleness was a symptom of a perpetual, inner, true love of birth
 lekin yahaan tak ki jab unka dil tut bhi jaataa to bhi unki tikhi palken nahin jhukati thim, bhale hi aasmaan main udaasi kyon na chaa jaae
 Which saxophone must have been more in the service of its owner than it is the instrument of Shammi, the world seems to be in the same time, in love, whatever has happened in someone
 brahmacharee main piano par unki ungliyaan aise barasati hai maano mumtaj kii museebaton ke liye vahi jimmedaar ho
 He acted in more than a hundred films but i do not think that the Punjabi love story heer-ranjha was part of those works

 Forty years later, it is easy to ignore the scream that came out of the stomach, into the throat, and then that blew your mind: Yahyaahyah! For me, in the bed-ridden cinema hall called Swapna, that scream of the wild was the voice of liberation from the idiotic boredom of tradition

 When i was 10 years old and had just been sentenced to boarding school, Shammi Kapoor told us to go and find our voice, even if it sometimes proved to be an outcry
 agar ban sakate ho to pratibhashali bano; agar bananaa pade to bevakoof bhi bano; lekin kisi bhi maamle main asli bano
 There was fun, fun in both forms

 Together they measure as much as the ascension of the Himalayas, but more accurately, they used to travel from the blazing sun in the morning to the mist of the evening and the velvety night

 Shammi, in this color changing world, the intention of man is not right, do not come out, and if you do not sing the intention of faith properly, then the evening starts to fall

 When Talat Mehmood tried to become an actor, Shammi gave him a sensible advice
 ''talat sahab, aap itnaa acha gaate hai
 
 
 Why are you wasting your time by acting? "only Rafi and Shammi could turn the roar of the British Empire's high elite into a sweet Indian humming
 britain kaa sattadhari varg jaade main barish or barfbaari ke dauraan lomadee ke shikaar par jaataa tha tab ''teli ho!'' (shikaar dikhne par shikariyon or shikari kutton ko uksaane ke liye lagaai jane vaali aawaaj) chillaata tha, jise pi

 Shammi and Rafi lighten it up, and add to it the magic of music that still haunts the mind and mind like it did four decades ago

 If you have to set your heart somewhere along the way, somewhere or somewhere, without hearing anything, you may have been born without heart

 ’ Many districts of Uttar Pradesh are in the grip of dengue these days
 kai log dengue ke chalate apni jaan gavaan chuke hai to badi taadaat main log aspataalon main bhartee hai
 a patient suffering from dengue died during treatment at Balrampur Hospital in Lucknow on Wednesday
 mritak ke parijanon ne aspataal par laaparvaahee kaa aarope lagaaya he
 Earlier on Monday, a patient was killed during treatment in Barabanki
 vahiin pradesh ke parivaar kalyaan mantri ravidaas mehrotra kaa kahana he ki sabhi aspataalon ko alert kar diya gaya he, aspataalon main dengue ke alag se ward banaae gaye hai or vahaan sabhi suvidhaae hai
 He also said that strict action will be taken against the officials from where the Bhilaparwahi case will come up
 parivaar kalyaan mantri kaa kahana he ki logon kodengue se bachaneke liye tike lagaae gaye the jis vajah se dengue ke maamle main giravat ai he
 He also said that dengue facilities have been made available in many private hospitals
 subjiyon ke daamon main lagaataar utaar chadhaav aa rahaa he
 Tomato prices in the wholesale market, which were up to Rs 20 per kg till a day earlier, have gone up from Rs 14 to 16 per kg on Monday, but the onion is once again ready to be made

 The main issue of the recently concluded general elections was the issue of leadership
 bijepi ke chunaav prachaar kaa jor yah tha ki sattadhari netritv kamjor or dhulmul he, jisamen nirnay lene kii kshamta nahin he
 Narendra Modi projected himself as a firm and decision-making leader
 bijepi ne bhi khud ko ummid or badlaav laane vaali party ke rup main prastut kiya, ek aisi party jo yuvaaon kii ummiido ko puraa kar sakati he
 In response to this aggressive attack, Rahul Gandhi and Congress tried to identify themselves as a party sensitive to the poor, minorities and the downtrodden of the society
 congress party or uske sahyogi dalon ne yah dikhaane kii koshish kii ki modi samaaj ko baantne kii raajnneeti karte hai, isliye ve rashtriya netaa nahin ban sakate
 In our opinion, this election was focused on these two options before the people of India
 bijepi ne khud ko badlaav laane vaali party ke taur par pesh kiya
 Modi has presented himself as a national leader who can bring the same development across India as he has done in Gujarat, that is, economic development
 keval modi jaisaa nirnaayak netaa hi is tarah kaa vikaas laa saktaa he
 The election campaign that the Congress party ran was more negative
 usne apane prachaar main modi kii vibhaajankaree raajnneeti or apni samaveshi niti par jor dene kii koshish kii
 The Congress and other parties also questioned the model of Gujarat's economic development and tried to explain that this development was done at the cost of the poor and farmers
 bijepi kii ore se ek drudh netaa ke jariye ummid or sunahare bhavishya kii tasviir dikhaane kaa sakaaratmak sandesh diya gaya, jiske kaaran vah votaron ko apni ore khinchne main safal rahi, jabaki congress kaa nakaaratmak chunaav prachaar matadaataaon ko rijhaane main naakaam rahaa
 We used data from the India Today group-cicero National Post Poll Survey to show the impact of a decisive leadership
 yah janamat surveykshan baangi surveykshan prayog (vivaran ke liye dekhen vidhi kaa box) par aadhaarit tha
 This is a new experiment of its kind in media-sponsored opinion polls in India
 ek kaarak kaa duusare kaarak par asar jaanane ke liye hamane baangi ke taur par chune gaye uttardaataaon se do main se kisi ek sawaal kaa jawaab dene ko kaha-kya netaa ko jhatpat faisle karne vaala hona chahie yaa use sabko saath lekar chalane vaala hona chahie, bhale hi nirnay lene kii gati kuch dhimi ho?hamane paaya ki zyaadaatar bhartiya ek drudh or nirnay lene vaala netaa pasand karte hai
 83 percent of the respondents said that the country needs a decision-making leader, while only 69 percent believed that the country needs a leader to take everyone along
 yah aankada chaunkaane vaala he kyonki vibhinn jati-samudaayon, sthanon, yaa mahila-purushon main jawaab kii yahi pravriti dekhne ko mili
 The proportion of those who preferred a decisive leader was much higher than the proportion of people who wanted an inclusive leader (see first graphic)
 yahaan tak ki zyaadaatar rajya bhi samaveshi netaa ke mukaable ek nirnayashil netaa chaahate hai (dekhen suchi 1)
 The states expressing such opinions are Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Delhi, Tamil Nadu, Jharkhand, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Kerala and Haryana
 assam, chhattisgarh, karnataka or punjab chaahate hai ki unka netaa nirnayashil or samaveshi ho, lekin unhone zyada samaveshi netaa ko praathamikta nahin di
 Odisha and Andhra Pradesh want their leader to be more inclusive than decisive
 kul-milakar desh ne is baar aar yaa paar kaa mood banaaya tha
 Did this desire of a firm leader help BJP in the elections? To answer this question, we used statistical models to estimate the probability of voting among those seeking a decisive leader
 ek nirnaayak netaa kii variyata se bijepi kaa vot 3 fisadi bad gaya
 This is a large number by any standard, as the tilt in favor of BJP is around 12 per cent since 2009
 rashtriya chunaav main 3 fisadi vot se 50-60 siton kaa ijapha ho saktaa he
 The mood of the country was definitely in favor of a decisive leader
 kya desh ne isi tarah ummid, badlaav or vikaas ke sandesh ko bhi variyata di? india today group-sisero neshnal post pole ke aankadon se pataa chalata he ki matadaata modi kii chhavi se prabhavit the
 His image in the electorate was completely different from the one created by his critics
 jab uttardaataaon se poocha gaya ki kya modi rashtriya hit or desh kii abhilaashaon kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai to 54 fisadi logon kaa jawaab haa main tha or 52 fisadi logon ne kaha ki modi bharat kii vikaas dar ko phir se tej kar sakate hai
 Man and woman, poor and rich, urban and rural, all had a good image of Modi
 kareeb 50 fisadi logon ne kaha ki modi bharat ke liye achche hai or ve desh main phir se vruddhi ko gati de sakate hai
 In other words, Modi's election campaign message affected most people in the country, especially the youth
 iske baavjood modi ke sandesh ne musalamaanon or daliton ko zyada prabhavit nahin kiya (dekhen doosraa graphic)
 What was the effect of the Congress campaign? Did people associate Modi with divisive politics? One in eight people in the country considered Modi divisive and six people believed that Modi rarely does politics of division
 saaf kahen to congress kii ore se modi ko vibhaajankaree netaa bataane kii koshish kaa utana asar nahin padaa, jitna ki modi kii ummid jagaane kii koshish kaa asar janata par padaa
 That is, the effect of Modi's attempt to arouse hope was relatively high
 iskaa ekmaatr apwaad muslim samudaay tha
 One in four Muslim voters believed that Modi does politics to divide the society (see third graphic)
 in chunaavon par netritv kaa baari or nirnaayak prabhaav padaa
 The BJP was victorious as it offered hope and a golden future leadership
 is sandesh kaa asar un logon main zyada spasht rup se dikhaai detaa he, jinhone 2009 main or usase pehle bijepi ko vot nahin diya tha, lekin 2014 main bijepi ko vot diya
 The leadership impact was the highest in this group
 2014 main duusari party ko chhodkar bijepi ko vot dene waalon main kareeb 60 fisadi ne modi ke sakaaratmak sandesh ke kaaran bijepi ko praathamikta di
 The positive impact of this positive message was seen among the youth, in which the chances of voting for BJP increased by almost one-third
 congress kii ore se koi aisa netaa nahin pesh kiya gaya, jo bharat ko sunahare bhavishya kii ore le ja saktaa he
 Instead, their leader tried to embarrass Modi
 party kii yah ranneeti desh ke zyaadaatar matadaataaon ko rijhne main vifal rahi
 The message of hope and firm leadership prevailed over the negative message
 yuva or mahatvakankshi bharat kisi nayak kii ore dekh rahaa tha
 Modi presented himself as one
 zyaadaatar log ek nirnayashil netaa chaahate hai
 BJP definitely benefited from this
 modi ko ab logon kii un ummiido ko puraa karnaa hoga, jo unhone khud paidaa kii hai
 Modi cannot hide behind his party or government institutions

 trinmul congress ke vidhayak or purv mantri madan mitra ko sibiai kii vishesh aparaadh shakha duusare rajya main bhej sakati he
 The agency is investigating the Saradha scam worth several crores
 ghotaale kii jaanch kar rahesibiaike ek sutara ne kaha, 'ham madan mitra ko duusare rajya main sthanantarit karne par vichaar kar sakate hai
 It is yet to be decided
 ' mitra ko agency ne pichley saal disambar main giraftaar kiya tha or vartmaan main vah alipur kendriya sudhaar grih main band hai
 His bail plea was recently rejected by the Calcutta High Court
 ek sawaal ke jawaab main unhone kaha, 'sawaal yah nahin he ki ham mitra ko yahaan rakhkar khush hai yaa nahin
 We are very professional in our work and will do whatever is required as per law
 mitra ko nichali adaalat ne jab jamaanat di to ham khush nahin the, jiske liye hamane turant hai court kaa darwaja khatkhataya
 There is doubt about Mitra's illness
 It is worth mentioning that since his arrest in December, Mitra has spent most of the time in a government hospital
 unki beemaari par andeh bhi jataayaa gaya he, kyonki jamaanat milane ke duusare din unhen aspataal se chuttee mil gai or aspataal ke adhikariyon ne unhen chikitsakeey rup se feet qaraar diya
 The source said that if the CBI decides to transfer Mitra from West Bengal, it will be for further revelations about his alleged involvement in the scam
 sibiai ne poorak aaropapatr main mitra ko bada labhaarthi bataaya tha
 Meanwhile, the CBI has summoned Trinamool Congress state general secretary Shankedeb Panda in connection with the Saradha scam

 Don't you think that fulfilling these promises can create a financial crisis in front of you? If you try to fulfill all the promises at once, then it will not be possible
 hamen inhen charanbaddh tareeke se lagu karnaa hoga, chaahe yah karmchaariyon ko niyamit karnaa ho yaa dhan kii kharid kaa mulya badhaane kaa maamla ho
 Is your government for farmers or industrialists? In the last five years, our fight has been for every section of society, that is why we have got an unprecedented mandate
 sarkaar har kisi ke hiton kaa dhyaan rakhegi
 What will the manifesto do to fulfill the promise of prohibition? The government wants liquor to be banned
 ham aadesh jari karke sharaab kii dukaanon ko band kara sakate hai lekin isse sharaab kii home delivery shuru ho sakati he

 We have to find some new way
 hamen maowad se prabhavit ilaakon main rahane vaale logon or vyapaariyon ke alaava un surakshakarmiyon or patrakaron kii salaah leni hogi jo vahaan kaam kar chuke hai
 Only then it can be resolved

 rajya ke chunaav main sthaneey netaaon ne congress ko jitayaa jabaki rajasthan or madhya pradesh main rashtriya str ke netaaon ko chunaav main laayaa gaya tha
 Looking at the success of Chhattisgarh, do you think this is a more successful model and should the Congress develop local leadership in the states? Only one election result cannot prove that the local leadership model is successful or the national leadership model to win 
 pradeshik or kendriya netritv ke donon hi model safal rahe hai or asafal bhi
 Both models must be coordinated to produce good results

 duniya bhar main ap lock ke 10 karod se bhi zyada yujar hai
 Most Android users use App Lock to secure their phone
 par ap lock main aisi kai khamia hai jisase ap lock ko bheda ja saktaa he
 Taking advantage of these flaws, hackers or your friends can blow up your secured photos, videos, contacts, call details or your required files
 ap lock android main ap, gailaree, photo or video se lekar tamaam tarah kii file ko pin yaa pattern lock ke jariye lock karne kii suvidha detaa he
 The app also allows vault to users in which you can store and store photos or videos
 dekhne main to ap lock kaaphi surakshit bhi lagata he par kya sach main aapkaa ap lock utana surakshit he jitna aap sochate hai:biond security ne apni ek report SSD main ap lock kii kuch gambhirasicuritikhamiyaan kaa zikr kiya he jinase ap lock ko bheda ja saktaa he
 According to those reports, you heighten any content of your smartphone in the vault of the app lock, but the app lock does not encrypt it, but rather through the inbuilt feature of your smartphone
 jisase aasaani se dekha ja saktaa he
 The first drawback, according to the researchers, is that one can view the contents of the app lock vault through some tricks of the file manager
 duusari khami,koi bhi ataikar aapke ap lock ke pin ko brut forcing atake ke jariye tod saktaa he jo zyada mushkil nahin he
 The third drawback, App Lock does not encrypt any files, so by rooting your smartphone, one can easily distinguish the password of your phone's App Lock
 chauthi khami,yah khami ataikars ko special parmishan kaa istemaal karke pin riset karne kaa opshan detii he
 According to the researchers, the app lock can also be misused through these techniques: If the user has not entered his email id in the app lock, the attacker can reset the password easily by entering his email ID in the app lock
 agar yujar ne email idi daal rakhi he to uskaa pin riset karnaa mushkil he, par havers virushark ke jariye ap lock ke pin ko intercept kar sakate hai

 In India's first Sports Literature Festival when Harbhajan was asked by a fan questioning Dhoni's future, the off-spinner's reply made everyone laugh
 sawaal ye tha ki harbhajan kya 2019 worldcup main mahendra singh dhoni ko kheltaa hua dekhte hai agar khud dhoni khelnaa chaahate hai kyonki ve lambey samay tak bhartiya team kii back-bone rahe hai
 Harbhajan said in his reply that "I also want to play
 maine bhi apni fitaness par kaam kiya he, ve team kii bakabon rahe hai to main bhi koi bone to rahaa hounga
 i have to play too, but i cannot answer this question
 dhoni ne jo kiya he wo bhartiya cricket main bada naam hai

 vaise main viraat kohli ko fitaness ke maamle main follow kar rahaa hum
 People follow Baba Ramdev, i follow Virat

 But this is when he performs very well here

 jo pichhali baar hua tha wo hi is baar hoga

 Earlier, Harbhajan was also asked a comparison between Sachin and Virat
 
 Which Bhajji rejected outright
 harbhajan ne kaha ki varat kohli or sachin tendulkar ke bich mere liye koi tulana nahin he
 
 mare vichaar main sachin tedulkar hi number 1 the or rahenge
 
 unki tulana nahin kii ja sakati
 Bhajji's impeccable style captivated the audience
 
 But in his own style, Bhajji also said his words

 He is always named among India's top spin bowlers] but he has also been known for his fun and fun in Team India's dressing room
 bharat ke pehle sports litrechar festival main jab harbhajan se ek fain ne dhoni ke bhavishya par sawaal poocha to is of spinner ke jawaab ne sabhi ko hansane par majaboor kiya
 The question was whether Harbhajan would see Mahendra Singh Dhoni playing in the 2019 World Cup if Dhoni himself wanted to play as he has been the back-bone of the Indian team for a long time
 harbhajan ne apane jawaab main kaha ki "main bhi khelnaa chahta hum
 i have also worked on my fitness, they have been the backbone of the team, so i must have been a bone
 mujhe bhi khelnaa he, lekin main is sawaal kaa jawaab nahin de saktaa
 What Dhoni has done is a big name in Indian cricket
 ve nahin honge to bhi bhartiya team ke liye acha sochenge
 By the way, i am following Virat Kohli in terms of fitness

 jisko bhajji ne sire se khaarij kar diya
 Harbhajan said that there is no comparison for me between Vrat Kohli and Sachin Tendulkar
 
 In my opinion, Sachin Tendulkar was and will remain No

 They cannot be compared
 bhajji ke is bebaak andaaz ne darshakon ko to lubhaaya hi
 
 lekin apane andaaz main hi bhajji apni baaten bhi kah gaye
 Not only this, Harbhajan Singh also predicted the india-australia series in his own style
 
 When Harbhajan was asked on the India Australia series, what will be the result of this series
 to harbhajan ne kaha 'australia agar bahut acha khelaa to wo 3-0 se haaregaa
 But this is when he performs very well here

 jo pichhali baar hua tha wo hi is baar hoga
 
 4-0 se haarenge'
 Earlier, Harbhajan was also asked a comparison between Sachin and Virat
 
 Which Bhajji rejected outright
 harbhajan ne kaha ki varat kohli or sachin tendulkar ke bich mere liye koi tulana nahin he
 
 mare vichaar main sachin tedulkar hi number 1 the or rahenge
 
 unki tulana nahin kii ja sakati
 Bhajji's impeccable style captivated the audience
 
 But in his own style, Bhajji also said his words

 Police reached the spot after getting information

 "since that incident, a cat-and-mouse game has started between the forest department and the family raising Hathini
 van vibhaag kaa daawa he ki wo hathini kii talash main jahaan-jahaan chapa maarthi, hathini lakshmi ko paal rahaa parivaar use vahaan se kahin or le jaataa
 When the forest department apprised the court about the whole case, it was given a time-limit to capture the elephant
 iske baad se hi van vibhaag kii team lakshmi kii talash main pareshaan thi
 Two days ago, the forest department team found elephant dung in the forest around Ghazipur and DCP office in East Delhi
 isse tay hua ki ho na ho yah gobar lakshmi kaa hi hoga kyonki dilli main baaki 5-6 haathiyon ko pakad kar kaaphi pehle hi gujarat ke sangrakshit ilaake main choda ja chukaa he
 As soon as the elephant dung was found in the forest near the District Deputy Commissioner of Police, the police started searching for Lakshmi
 purvi dilli jile ke disipi jasmit singh ke mutabik, "hathini ko kuch samay dilli se sate gajiabad main bhi chhipaakar rakhe jane kii khabaren aa rahi thim

 Many police teams are scouting for the accused
 is vaardaat ne dilli ko jhakzor diya he
 Somebody has said that politics begins in scope and ends there
 uttar pradesh main ek duusare kii jaani dushman rahi samaajawaadee party (sapa) or bahujan samaaj party (basapa) ke agua ek-duusare ko phooti ankhon nahin bhaate the
 But when the enemy is in common, and also strong, as well as the fight to save survival, then coming together becomes an adventure
 uttar pradesh main phulpur or gorakhpur loksabhaa siton par hone vaale upachunaav main sapa or basapa ke bich hue gathjod se holi ke baad bhi siyaasi akhaade main tamaam rangon ke gulaal ud rahe hai
 Many other parties have come with SP
 rashtriya lokdal, nishad party or pis party ne sapa ko samarthan de diya he
 But in the midst of this alliance, the Congress has marginalized itself, preparing itself for a big fight
 congress ko lagata he ki in donon siton par khud uske ummidavaar itane majboot hai jo akele dam par party ko jeet dilava denge
 By the way, in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the Congress got 4 percent votes in Gorakhpur and 6 percent in Phulpur
 lekin sapa-basapa ke voton ko jod kuch kahani kahata he
 Obviously, it will not be easy for Yogi Adityanath to compete in the by-election
 chunaav prachaar ke dauraan jubaani jang bhi tej ho gai he
 Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath is describing this alliance of his opponents in the election meetings as a combination of snakes and cows
 phir bhi, aankadon ke khel main yah sthiti bhaajapa ke liye kuch sahaj nahin rahane vaali he
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the Congress got just 4 percent votes in Gorakhpur
 lekin sapa ko 22 or basapa ko 17 fisadi vot mili the, vahiin bhaajapa ko 52 fisadi vot mili the
 That is, in terms of Lok Sabha elections, in Gorakhpur, not only the SP BSP but also the Congress, the BJP is on a much higher platform
 kareeb-kareeb yahi sthiti phulpur loksabhaa seat kii bhi thi
 Here too, BJP got 52 per cent votes, and SP, BSP and Congress together got three and 43 per cent votes
 lekin 2014 ke baad se mudde bhi badale, chunaav bhi
 Although the BJP beat the rest of the parties in the assembly, if the votes of these two parties are combined in terms of vote share, then the matter at least becomes competitive
 gorakhpur loksabhaa ke tahat paanch vidhansabhi siten hai
 Among them, SP BSP had 47 percent votes in Pipraich, while BJP got 34 percent
 sahajanwaan main sapa-basapa milakar 53 fisadi vot hote hai, bhajp ko 35 fisad, gorakhpur gramin main sapa-basapa ko 47 or bhaajapa ko 36 fisadi vot hasil hue the
 In Gorakhpur city, the SP was with the Congress, so here the Congress got 28 percent votes, the BSP got 11 percent votes
 bhaajapa ke khate main 39 fisadi vot mili the
 Whereas, Congress 27, BSP 18 BJP got 43 percent votes in Campiarganj
 phulpur loksabhaa kshetra ke andar bhi fafamau, saraanv, phulpup, elahabaad pashchim or elahabaad uttar, ye paanch vidhansabha siten aati hai
 If all the partners of these alliances are combined, the lowest votes are 51 per cent in Allahabad West and 54 per cent in Phaphamau
 jabaki bhaajapa ko sabase adhik elahabaad pashchim 43 or sabase kam fafamau main 41 fisadi vot mili the
 In fact, by going with the BSP, the SP wants to add the votes of Dalits, especially Nishad, to the vote bank of its backward and Muslims
 basapa ke kitne vot sapa ko transfar honge yah to nateezon ke baad hi pataa chalegaa, lekin do dushmano ko paas laane vaali vipatti bhaajapa ke dar se bana yah gathjod 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main bhi barkaraar rahegaa yaa nahin, hamaari dilchaspee is baat main adhik he

 2018 saal modi sarkaar apana aakhri bajet pesh karegi
 In view of the next year's Lok Sabha elections, this budget will not only be the last budget of the Modi government but will be very important for this government
 is bajet main modi sarkaar dwaara kii jane vaali ghoshnaaen or yojanaayen agle saal hone vaale loksabhaa chunaav main modi sarkaar kaa bhavishya tay karne main kargar sabit ho sakati hai
 The government has said openly that it will insist on inclusive growth rather than popping the populace, but analysts believe that in this budget, the government will do its best to woo the people of the country in view of the current economy
 is bajet se sabase zyada ummiden udyog jagat ko he
 After the first demonetisation and then the GST within 1 year, the country's small scale industry and the medium scale industry have become completely punctured
 haalanki bade audyogic gharaane hameshaa se hi jiesti kii maang karte rahe hai
 The corporate sector has high expectations from this budget of Modi government
 corporate sector main vitt mantri arun jetali se guhaar lagaai he ki vah is bajet main corporate tex ko 30% se ghataakar 25% ke bheetar rakhen
 Industry is demanding an increase in corporate tax to 18 percent
 is bajet ko lekar siaiai ke diarector general chandrakant banerjee ne aaj tak se baatcheet karte hue kaha kii audyogic jagat is bajet par nazren gadaaye hue hai or unhen sarkaar se ummid he ki vah corporate tex ko 30% se ghataakar 25% ke neeche rakhenge
 Chandrakant Banerjee said, "in the last two to three years, all the provisions in the budget are becoming very simple which is very good for the industry
 "siaiai ke mahanideshak ko lagata he ki jiesti ke chalate laghu udyog par bada bura prabhaav ab khatm ho chukaa he
 Even the medium scale industry has now recovered from GST
 udyog jagat jiesti kii jatilta ko lekar saamne ai mushkilon ko sweekaar kar rahaa he
 It feels that the solution is constantly coming out in the successive meetings of the GST Council, which is stabilizing the industry
 udyog jagat kii vitt mantri arun jetali se ummiido ke sawaal par jawaab dete hue siaiai ke diarector general chandraka banerjee ne aaj tak se kaha, "is bajet par hamaara dhyaan hona chahie ki aarthik vikaas kaise aage le jaaya jaae aarthik gatividhiyon ko kaise badhaayaa jaae or alag-alag udyog kshetra main ham kaise zyada se zyada maang ko badha saken
 For that we have demanded from the government that corporate tax be reduced by 30%
 ham ummid karte hai ki corporate tex kii adhiktam seemaa 30% se ghataakar 25% kii jaae
 Reducing corporate tax will not reduce the revenue of the government, but will result in more and more economic activities
 economik gatividhiyaan zyada badhengi to aarthik vikaas bhi hoga or zyada se zyada logon ko rojgaar milegaa aise main sarkaar kii kamai bhi badhegi
 "industry is considering increasing demand in rural areas as a major challenge
 siaiai ke mahanideshak kehete hai ki is bajet main hamen ummid he gramin kshetron main maang ko kaise zyada se zyada badaye
 There should also be a greater focus on agriculture
 agar gramin ilaakon main ham maang badha paae to arthvyavastha ke liye ek acchhee baat hogi
 Hoping the Modi government's last budget, the industry has also seen a period of tension when GST and demonetisation had double-blamed on the industry
 modi sarkaar ne in yojanaon ko aarthik sudhaar qaraar diya tha
 Now the industry says that the picture of these economic reforms should be seen in this glimpse
 aaj tak se baatcheet main chandrakant banerjee ne kaha, "hamen bahut zyada ummiden hai kyonki yah bahut mahatvapurn bajet hoga or mahatvapurn isliye hoga kyonki sarkaar dwaara pichley 3 saal main lagu kii gai aarthik sudhaaron kii jhalak najar aani chahie

 So old drums were cut and chairs and tables were made
 bekaar pade conection transfarmar bhi kursiyon main tabdeel kar diye gaye

 ramdev bole- sirf ayodhya par hi kyon nikle bich kaa rastasupreme court ne surakshit rakh liya he ayodhya maamle par faislaram janmabhumi-babari masjid maamle main hindustan kii sarvocch adaalat ne sunwaayee puri kar lee he or faisla surakshit rakh liya he
 The Supreme Court will soon give its verdict on this
 isi bich yogaguru ramdev makka madina or vatican city main mandir banane kii jagah dene kii shart par ayodhya maamle main bich kaa rasta nikaalane kii baat kah rahe hai
 Let me tell you that Mecca Medina is the holy place of Muslim religion, while Vatican City has a Roman Catholic Church
 ram mandir maamle par bich kaa rasta nikaalane ke sawaal par ramdev ne kaha ki makka madina main bhi bich kaa rasta nikaalnaa chahie or vahaan hamako ek konaa diya jaae, taaki ham vahaan par ram, krishna or shiv kii murti sthapit kar saken
 He said that we should also be given a corner in Vatican City, so that we can put Hanuman statue there
 ajtak se khaas baatcheet main yogaguru ramdev ne kahaaki ayodhya main sabhi bich kaa rasta nikaalnaa chaahate hai, lekin makka madina or vatican city main bich kaa rasta nikaalane ke liye koi taiyaar nahin he
 He also said that in Pakistan and Afghanistan, there is no talk of finding a middle ground
 ramdev ne sawaal uthaaya ki kya sabhi bich ke raste hindustan main hi nikaale jaaenge?ayodhya main janme the ram, puri duniya jaanati haih ramdeois dauraan ek sawaal ke jawaab main yogagururamdevne kaha ki ayodhya main ram mandir banegaa
 We are not seeking to build a Ram temple in Mecca Medina and Vatican City
 yah sach puri duniya maanati he ki ayodhya main ram paidaa hue the
 Rama is our ancestor
 chaahe koi unako insaan maane yaa bhagwaan maane
 Everyone in the world pays respect to their ancestors
 ram mandir banane se purvajon ko sammaan milegaa
 'ram should also get justice' Yogguru questioned that if we are the majority, will we not get justice? It is wrong to make any kind of decision religiously
 unhone kaha ki satya ke aadhaar par faisla hona chahie
 Ram was preceded by religions
 ram ko bhi nyaay milanaa chahie
 When Ramdev was told that the mosque was not built in Mecca Medina, while the structure of the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya was demolished, he replied that thousands of temples were destroyed in India
 iske baad in mandiron kii jagah masjid banaai gayi, to in sabakaa hisaab hona chahie
 Ramdev said - Why the mosque in Kashi Vishwanath? Ramdev said that if all cannot be accounted for, then there should be some
 unhone sawaal kiya ki kaashi vishwanath main masjid kaa kya kaam he? isi tarah mathura main krishna janmabhumi ke paas masjid banane kaa kya matlab he? in masjidon se saaf he ki mughal baadshahon ne majahabi aadhaar par pehle krurta kii thi
 Meanwhile, Ramdev said that he also advocated starting a debate on the matter
 ram ko kaalpanik maanati he congress ramdevvir saavarkar ko bharat ratna dene kii maang ke khilaaf asaduddin ovaisi or congress ke bayaan par bhi ramdev ne pratikriya di
 He said, 'owaisi wants to fight people religiously
 wo pratishodh or ghrinaa kii raajnneeti karte hai
 Apart from this, as far as the Congress is concerned, it has described Ram as imaginary
 purv pradhanmantri jawahar laal nehru ne discovery of india main ramayana or mahabharat ko kaalpanik granth or ram va krishna ko kaalpanik kairactor kaha he, jo behad aapattijanak he
 The Congress has forgotten its ancestors, which has led to this condition
 rashtriya str par vipaksh tak nahin najar aa rahaa he
 The opposition has fallen victim to an accident
 ’ramdev ne kaha, ‘kuch chhot bhaiye vaicharik aatankwaad paidaa karnaa chaahate hai
 Some people are trying to fight on the basis of religion and caste
 vir saavarkar kaa puraa ghar or khandaan barbaad kar diya gaya tha, to wo ek kshan ke liye haar gaye the, to kya unako apradhi maan liya jaae? unhone kaha ki hindutv kii baat karnaa aparaadh he kya? vir saavarkar apane paramparaon ke prati garv rakhte the
 They should get Bharat Ratna
 yahaan dekhen yoga guru ramdev kaa puraa intervyuu

 As far as mixed townships are concerned, i certainly support the idea of a separate settlement, let Kashmiri Pandit colonies be established in Kashmir and then let others settle if they want to settle
