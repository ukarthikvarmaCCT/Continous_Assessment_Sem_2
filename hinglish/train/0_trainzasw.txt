 The song of the Hindi film Vivah was shown to be fully alive at Ballia District Hospital
 antar sirf yah tha ki yahaan duulhaa jhulasa tha or dulhan baraat lekar pahunchi thi
 There was neither band, nor any baraati in the procession
 apane parivaar ke saath baraat lekar pahunchi dulhan ke hausale ko har kisi ne salaam kiya
 Actually, the tilakotsav of Umesh Singh, resident of Kharoni, Raja village of Bansdih Kotwali area, was completed in the past
 iske baad baraat jaani thi, lekin ek din pehle hi umesh ke ghar gas silendar risaav se aag lag gai
 In this incident, Umesh's mother Rajeshwari Devi (62) was badly burnt, while Rajeshwar Singh (58), Umesh Singh (25), Sanjay Singh (35) and Sindhu Singh (30) were injured in saving her
 sabhi kaa upachaar jila aspataal main chal rahaa he
 Umesh was not in a condition to carry the procession due to scorching
 isaki soochna milane ke baad ladki paksh ke log shaadi kii tithi aage badhaane kaa man bana chuke the, dulhan gudiya ne apane mata-pita ke saamne yah prastaav rakh diya ki chaahe jo ho, shaadi umesh se hi hogi or nirdhaarit tithi par hi
 In response to Gudiya's questions, his family members were informed about this by Umesh's village
 gudiya kaa hausala dekh umesh ne bhi nirdhaarit tithi par hi parinay sutara main bandhane kii ijaajat de di
 After this, Radha Kishun Singh, a resident of Umdha in Chhapra district of Bihar state, along with his daughter Gudiya and other relatives reached the district hospital in a simple manner
 tippaniyan The groom Raja Umesh, lying on the bed of the burn ward of the district hospital, was brought without a suit-boot to the temple in the hospital premises, where the doll wrapped in the bride's dress was seated
 umesh kii haalat dekh gudiya kii ankhon se aansu tapakane lage
 Before the wedding, every human eye stared at the scene there
 sade mahaul main jab umesh ne gudiya kii maang main sindur bharaa, to sabhi is agaadh prem ko dekhakar khush ho uthe
 After this, the bridegroom left Raja in hospital for treatment and Gudiya went to her in-laws
 darasal, bansadih kotwali kshetra ke raja gaanv kharauni nivasee umesh singh kaa tilkotsav beete dinon sampann hua tha
 After this the procession was to be known, but the day before, a gas cylinder leak broke out in Umesh's house
 is ghatana main umesh kii maa rajeshwari devi (62) buree tarah jhulas gai, jabaki unhen bachaane main rajeshwar singh (58), umesh singh (25), sanjay singh (35) va sindhu singh (30) ghayal ho gayi
 All are undergoing treatment at the district hospital
 jhulasane ke kaaran umesh baraat lekar jane kii haalat main nahin tha
 After getting the information of this, the people of the girl side had made up their mind to extend the date of the wedding, the bride doll proposed to her parents that whatever happens, the marriage will be from Umesh and only on the scheduled date
 gudiya ke sawaalon ke saamne niruttar hue uske parivaar waalon ne isaki soochna umesh ke gaanv di
 Seeing the encouragement of the doll, Umesh also gave permission to tie the knot on the scheduled date
 iske baad bihar rajya ke chhapra janapad ke umadhaa nivasee radha kishun singh apni beti gudiya va anya parijanon ke saath saadhaaran tareeke se jila aspataal pahunche
 The comments jila aspataal ke bern ward kii bed par pade duulhe raja umesh ko bina suut-boot ke hi aspataal parisar main sthit mandir par laayaa gaya, jahaan dulhan ke libaas main lipati gudiya baithi thi
 Seeing Umesh's condition, tears started dripping from the doll's eyes
 shaadi se pehle vahaan kaa najaara dekh har insaani aankh dabdba gayi
 When Umesh filled the vermilion in demand of the doll in plain mood, everyone was happy to see this immense love
 iske baad duulhe raja ko upachaar ke liye aspataal main chhod gudiya sasuraal chali gayi
 In this incident, Umesh's mother Rajeshwari Devi (62) was badly burnt, while Rajeshwar Singh (58), Umesh Singh (25), Sanjay Singh (35) and Sindhu Singh (30) were injured in saving her

 Concerned over Baba Ramdev's announcement that he would go on a hunger strike from Saturday, the government took an extraordinary step to persuade him and sent Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee and three other senior ministers to the airport to talk to the yoga guru
 haalanki, aisa prathit nahin ho rahaa ki ramdev anshan par jane kii apni yojana chhod denge
 In April, Union ministers Mukherjee, Kapil Sibal, Pawan Kumar Bansal and Subodh Kant Sahay held talks with Ramdev at the airport's Terminal-3 here in an attempt to prevent a recurrence of the situation arising after social activists led by Gandhian Anna Hazare in April
 
 yogaguru madhya pradesh ke ujjain se chartered jet main savaar hokar hawaii adde pahunche
 He turned back on Wednesday from his Tuesday statement to keep the Prime Minister and the Chief Justice of India out of the purview of the Lokpal

 He said, 'satyagraha will be held on June 4 at Ramlila Maidan and in 624 districts across the country as crores of people want to get rid of black money and corruption and bring changes in the system
 ’ anshan par nahin jane kii pradhanmantri manmohan singh kii apil ke bare main puche gayi sawaal par yogaguru ne kaha, ‘main dar main yaa dar paidaa karne main yakeen nahin rakhata
 We have raised the issues of national interest
 yah ladaai kisi vyakti yaa kisi party ke khilaaf nahin he
 So, we are not even criticizing anyone
 ’baba ramdev ko anshan par jane se rokane ke liye sarkaar vastut: koi kasar baaki nahin chhodana chaahati
 Yogguru is about to go on a hunger strike demanding the withdrawal of black money stashed abroad and issuing an ordinance in this regard
 ramdev ne kaha ki baatcheet ‘sakaaratmak’ rahi or kuch muddon par sahmati bhi bani
 He said that till all the issues will not be 100 percent agreed and will not reach any decisive level, then the fast will continue
 unhone kaha, ‘yah ek badi ladaai he
 We have to change the system of 64 years
 yah aasaan kaam nahin he
 But we will do so
 ’ udhar, sarkaar ne kaha ki ramdev ne rashtrahit ke gambhir mudde uthaaye hai or agle kuch dinon tak unase baatcheet jari rakhi jaayegi
 Sibal told reporters after the meeting, 'he (ramdev) raised such important issues, which affect the future of the country
 ye mahatvapurn rashtriya mudde hai
 They were limited to one or two issues
 lekin unke paas kai mudde hai
 We have responded directly to them
 ’unhone kaha, ‘ham ek javabdeh sarkaar chalaa rahe hai
 We will take steps on all issues
 ye gambhir mudde hai
 The government will not only think seriously about this, but will also take further steps in this direction
 ’sibbal ne charchaa kaa adhik vivaran dene se inkaar kar diya
 Describing black money and corruption as two sides of the same coin, Ramdev said that the main issues raised before the government include making a strong Lokpal, enacting the Public Service Delivery Guarantee Act to be implemented in all states and maximum death to the corrupt
 The issue of setting up fast-track courts to deliver verdicts within a year, including sentencing
 ramdev ne kaha ki kaledhan ko rashtriya sampatti ghoshit kiya janaa chaiye
 An ordinance should be promulgated and then a bill should be brought to bring back the black money hidden in the countries considered to be a hideout of tax evasion
 unhone kaha, ‘sarkaar ke samaksh bhrashtachar, kaledhan or samaybaddh tareeke se vyavastha main sakaaratmak sudhaar laane jaise janhit or rashtrahit ke mudde maujuud hai
 The yoga teacher said that the ministers discussed the issues with seriousness
 ramdev ke pahunchane se kaaphi pehle hi kendriya mantri hawaii adde pahunch gayi the
 Cabinet secretaries with ministers
 em chandrashekhar bhi shaamil the
 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has also shown an extraordinary stand and requested Ramdev not to go on hunger strike and promised him that a 'practical and result-oriented' solution would be found to deal with the issue of corruption
 pradhanmantri ne ramdev ko patr likhakar shashan vyavastha ko durust karne ke liye diye gayi unke sujhaavon ko sakaaratmak bataate hue unka swaagat kiya he
 He has also assured the yoga teacher that the government is keen to work with him and members of the society towards building a prosperous India
 singh ne apane patr main ramdev ko bataaya ki vitt mantri mukherjee or adhikari unke uthaaye gayi muddon par baatcheet jari rakhenge
 Singh expressed hope in the letter that Baba Ramdev would change his decision to go on fast unto death

 General (retired) jacob-farz-rafael (JFR) Jacob was one of the victors in the 1971 indo-pakistan war
 isi jang ke kaaran bangladesh bana
 72-year-old General (retired) Ved Prakash Malik was the army chief during the Kargil war in 1999
 is jang main pakistani ghuspaithiyon ko jammu or kashmir ke oonchai vaale ilaakon se khadeda gaya tha
 These two generals, who fought India's last and most distinct type of war, sat down with Deputy Editor Sandeep Unnithan in New Delhi to take stock of the current situation in the army
 rajnatik safagoi or sena ko raajnneeti se mukt rakhane kii jarurat tathaa china kii sainya takat se mil rahi buniyadi dhaanche or aadhunikeekaran kii chunauti ke sandarbh main baat kii
 Will the Indian Army today be able to fight the war in the future? Is the Indian Army a dinosaur? JFR Jacob: (JFR) Basically the Indian Army is a World War II Army
 isamen koi badlaav nahin hua he
 The military lacks mobility and is defense-focused
 veda prakaash malik:ranneetik maahaul hameshaa gatisheel rahata he
 The war that we fought in 1962 was different from the 1971 war fought in their time or the 1999 war in my time because the politics and geo-strategy of a region changes
 technology se judaa nayaa vikaas bhi hua he
 In such a situation, the mind of the political leadership also works differently
 bhartiya sena kii rakshaatmak soch rakhane kii vajah?malik:rajnatik netritv ek inch jameen bhi nahin khona chahta
 This is the reason why we were not allowed to cross the border in Kargil in 1999
 to kya sena ke cold start siddhant ko, jisamen dushman ke khilaaf bijli kii gati se hamale shaamil hai, is rakshaatmak rajnatik maansikta kii pratikriya mana jaae?malik:nahin
 This was because we used to take time to get into action
 in dinon palak jhapakate hi sangharsh kii sthitiyaan paidaa ho jaati hai, isliye tej pratikriya dene kii jarurat paidaa ho gai he
 The so-called 'cold start' is actually a strategic necessity
 jab aap sena main bhartee hue the, tab kya aapako pataa tha ki itane saare faujee aantarik ugravad se ladgaye main tainaat the?jaikab:indira gandhi damdaar thim
 They knew what to do
 pashchim bengal main jab halaat kaabo se baahar ho gaye, to unhone naksaliyon ke khilaaf sena kaa istemaal kiya
 The Naxal rebellion was born due to economic and social reasons, which we never corrected
 malik:haal ke varshon main sarkaar aantarik suraksha main fouj kaa lagaataar istemaal karti rahi he
 This situation is neither good for the country nor for the army
 kuch samay baad log faujee bandishon ke aadi ho jate hai or uske baad ek had tak algaav paidaa ho jaataa he
 Whatever it is, but it affects the thinking and training of the soldiers
 rajnatik netritv kii ore se disha-nirdeshon kii spashtataa kis tarah sainya abhiyaanon ko prabhavit karti he?malik:agar aapkaa rajnatik lakshya or anya koi bhi lakshya aapke saamne spasht kar diya jaae, to phir aapaki ranneeti, kadam sab kuch usee hisaab se chalate hai
 But if the direction is not right in the beginning, then there is a big problem
 1962 kii jang ko dekh lijie
 We were not ready for the mountain war
 aaj us mukaable chijen behatar hai, or jaisaa 1999 main tha, rajnatik disha-nirdesh kaaphi saaf hai
 Jacob: i was fortunate to have worked with leaders like Indira Gandhi, who were rich in strong intentions and not nervous at all, and Jagjivan Ram who provided us with everything we needed to fight
 ye vyaavhaarik netaa the
 i do not know about today's leaders
 kya ham apane sabase bade padosi china se nipatane ke liye taiyaar hai?malik:beshak ham pehle se kahin zyada taiyaar hai
 Today both countries have nuclear weapons that have drawn a border line
 sirf ek samasya he ki hamane seemaa par paryaapt buniyadi dhaancha viksit nahin kiya he jiske chalate senaayen hamalaa or raksha donon karne main sakasham ho paati hai
 If you want to avoid rust, the equipment should be as much as possible
 philhal ham jang ladgaye kii sthiti main to hai lekin use roak paane kii sthiti main nahin hai
 The army is well armed? Malik: We need 155 mm howitzers
 pahaado main maarak kshamta badhaane ke liye aapako paryaapt maatra main inaki jarurat hoti he
 We were lucky that there was no large-scale war, so we could put our cannons in Kargil
 philhal boforce ke baad ham kuch bhi nahin kharid sake hai
 We also need better surveillance and picture-taking satellites
 aaj ranneetik maahaul kaaphi gatisheel he, isliye aapako sibar jang ke liye bhi taiyaar rahanaa hoga
 New army divisions should get helicopters to speed up their movement from one place to another
 jaikab:hamen awajahi par phir sochna hoga
 We need three more divisions and one armed division in the Northeast
 ham chini fouj ko roke rakh sakate hai, lekin sthaneey str par hamaare paas hamalaa karne kii paryaapt kshamta nahin he
 Why is there such a shortage of officers in the army? Malik: Young officers, junior leaders do the job of winning the war
 hamaare paas ve paryaapt sankhya main nahin hai kyonki pramotion kii raftaar dhimi he
 The amount of time an officer becomes a brigadier or major general has spent three-fourths of his service or even more
 main 14 saal kii sarvice ke baad commanding afasar (sio) bana
 Lieutenant General Jacob became CO at an early age
 is tarah aapako seekhney kaa or vakt miltaa he
 We must make the army's job more attractive
 duusare, hausala badhaane vaale aise kadam uthaane honge taaki yuva afasar fouj ko chhodkar na jaaen
 Is scandal a reason for making a career in the army distasteful? Malik: Some officers have come out as bad examples
 unhen dandit kiya janaa chahie, aisa ho bhi rahaa he
 If you look at the strength of the entire army, the scams are affecting the recruitments
 kya aapako lagata he ki sena main raajnneetikaran badha he?malik:sena kii buniyaad gaiyr rajnatik rahi he
 Take general jaikab or field marshall kariyappa jaise logon ne sena ke gaiyr rajnatik charitra ko sthapit karne kaa kaam kiya he
 i also give credit to the political leadership of that time
 aaj bhi vahi paripati chali aa rahi he
 Has it increased the distance between the political and military leadership? Malik: We have created our top defense organizations exactly like this, and you have brought bureaucrats between the army and the leaders
 jang ke dauraan hamaara zyada samvaad rajnatik netritv se hota he
 In normal conditions the distance increases, but this should not happen
 rajnatik or sainya netritv ke bich zyada profeshnal rishta hona chahie
 Should the army be withdrawn from the Siachen Glacier? Malik: You can retain the Karakoram Pass only as long as you keep a deployment on Saltoro Ridge
 ek samay tha jab main kah saktaa tha ki yadi vaastavik ground pojishan line tay ho jaati to ham uske peeche apni tainaati hataa lete
 Today i can not say the evacuation of Siachen
 ab yah akele bharat or pakistan kaa maamla nahin rah gaya he kyonki china ab pakistan adhikrut kashmir main ghus chukaa he
 Due to these strategic changes we cannot move away from there
 aap ek aise ilaake ko khaali katai nahin kar sakate jahaan chini or pakistani fujen milakar kaam kar rahi hon
 What is so special in the army is that a lot of beauty queens and heroines are coming from there, such as Priyanka Chopra, Gul Panag, Anushka Sharma

 What are the expectations from myself? i want to do good work, within myself i have seen many changes in the last several years, everything i have learned is learned on the set of the film itself

 What else do you want to learn at this stage of my career? i was talking to Dada (anurag Basu) during the shooting of 'jagga Jasoos' 2 days ago, i think i should learn the guitar because it is my heart's desire And i also have his basic knowledge

 According to me, understanding the depth of love, it should be respected, that is why it is always useful
 pyaar ko sammaan denge to wo aapako aaajeevan phayda degaa
 The tag line of the film is 'ishq nahi easy', how much do you believe it? See, we often think about what happened yesterday and what will happen tomorrow, we forget about today because of this tomorrow

 Tomorrow is not in our hands

 ) Amit Shah wants one language, one identity and one party supremacy
the constitution was not designed only for 2 people of Gujarat
 All India majlis-e-ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) chief Asaduddin Owaisi has once again targeted Home Minister Amit Shah
 ovaisi ne kaha he ki shah puure desh main ek vishwaas, ek bhashaa, ek pahchaan or ek party kaa varchasv chaahate hai
 Through the tweet, Owaisi said that the constitution was made for everyone, not just the ambition of 2 men of Gujarat
 ovaisi ne kaha ki har party kii upasthiti bharat ko majboot karti he or samaaj ke ek hisse ko aawaaj detii he
 Indeed, Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Tuesday questioned whether the multi-party parliamentary democratic system in the country was successful
 ek kaarykram ko sambodhat karte hue amit shah ne kaha ki hamaare samvidhan nirmaataaon kaa uddeshy tha ki desh ke sabhi logon ko apane adhikaar milen, sabhi kaa jivan unnat ho or sabko samaan maukey mili, lekin aazaadee ke 70 saal ke baad kii vyavasthaaon ke kaaran desh ke sabhi logon ke man main ye sawaal uth gaya tha ki bahu-party loktantrit system kahin fail to nahin ho rahaa, logon main niraashaa thi
 Owaisi's attack on Amit Shah: Before responding to Amit Shah's statement on Tuesday, Owaisi also attacked the Hindi language statement of the Home Minister
 unhone kaha ki hindi, hindu or hindutv se kahin bada he bharat
 He said that Hindi is not the mother tongue of every Indian
 kya aap is desh kii kai maatrubhaashaen hone kii vividhta or khubsuurati kii prashansa karne kii koshish karenge
 Not only this, he further said that Article 29 of the Constitution gives every Indian the right to have their own separate language and culture
 kya kaha tha amit shah nehindi diwas ke maukey par grih mantri amit shah ne hindi ko lekar ek ahvan kiya tha
 He said that we should have a language which can defeat English on the world stage, so we should try to use Hindi as much as possible
 magar shah ke is ahvan ne raajnneeti main ghamaasan machaa diya
 Bollywood actor and singer Diljit Dosanjh was to participate in a program in the US on 21 September
 event ko pakistan ke rehaan siddki ne organij kiya he

 puure maamle par dilajit dosanjh ne apana paksh rakhaa he
 Sharing a post on social media, Diljit wrote, "I have just learned that a letter has been issued by the Federation of Western India Cine Employees (FWICE)
 mujhe iske bare main pehle jaankaree nahin thi
 i want to tell that my contract is only from Shri Balaji Entertainment

 The program is scheduled to take place on 21 September this month
 chitthee ke mutabik dilajit dosanjh ek shandaar singer hai, magar rehaan siddiki ne unhen bahakaaya he

 FWICE ne kaha ki ham guzarish karte hai ki dilajit dosanjh kaa america main parformens ke liye diya gaya vija cancel kar diya jaae
 We are doing our duty by writing this letter, hoping that the government will take action on it soon

 unhone kaha ki jab bhi basapa pramukh kisi galati main pakadi jaati hai to ve apane aap ko dalit kii beti bataati hai or nahin pakadi jaati hai to daulat kii beti hoti hai

 bharat kii company torato ne haal hi main kai nae spikars launch kiye hai
 One of these is boombox which is in the category of a budget Bluetooth speaker
 dizin segment premium spikars se inspire he or travel ke samay ise apane saath le janaa aasaan he
 We have tested this speaker in almost every way
 is spikar ke rivyuu main saadhaaran shabdon main padhenge ki ye spikar aapke liye kaisaa sabit hoga or is range main ye aapke kharidne laayak he yaa nahin
 The design and build quality is clear from the pictures that its design is cylindrical and there are speakers on both sides
 isamen sab vufar bhi he jo bich main he
 Fox leather finish makes it good to see
 control ke liye kies die gaye hai jinaki bild quality or behatar kii ja sakati thi
 The control keys are loose, so it is not even premium
 lekin is price range ke hisaab se thik thaak hi he
 Overall, it can be said to be right in terms of design and build quality
 mujeec control ke liye spikar ke centre main kuch kies hai
 The power button is in the center and has four keys all around it
 yaheen par aapako micro esady slot or yuasabi port bhi miltaa he
 3
 5mm kaa jaik bhi he jisase conect kar sakate hai
 Charging can also be done from here
 sound kaisaa haiek bluetooth spikar se aap hai quality audio kii ummid nahin kar sakate hai
 However, this has changed in a few years and now Bluetooth speakers also give good quality output
 yah spikar madhyam darje kaa he
 It is good for having a house party or traveling somewhere
 sound itnaa zyada he ki phul wolum par karke aapke kaan dard kar sakate hai
 The audio from this speaker is excellent in medium sound and this is its specialty
 kya hai is spikar ke spacificationsisak vajan lagbhag 1 kilo lagata he paper par yah 898 gram hi he, lekin 1 kilo kaa lagata he
 If it were lighter, perhaps traveling with it would have been even easier
 isamen lithium kii bydaree he or iskaa power 1,00mah he
 Its Bluetooth range is 10 meters
 yah spikar chaar inch lanbaa he
 The output of the speaker is 7W
 charch karne ke liye aapako ise lagbhag 5 ghante tak socket main lagaana hoga agar phul bydaree kerani he
 a charging indicator is provided so that you can understand whether it is charging or not
 company ne daawa kiya he ki isaki bydaree 6 ghante kaa byaap degi or daawey par yah spikar khara utarataa he
 This boombox also has an FM radio which is a plus point for this
 connactivityyah boombox multi connactivity saport karata he yani ox mod, bluetooth or esady card se gane sun sakate hai
 All three connections work well and we did not face any problem in them
 conection stable hone kii vajah se koi erar yaa interference nahin hota
 What speaker should you buy? The price of this speaker is Rs 5,499
 isse kharidne ke pehle aapako kai chijen dhyaan main rakhni hogi

 aaj tak reating - 4 / 5 If the beginning is good, then understand that it is half way across
 kahawat thik he basharte ise bharat ke aarthik sudhaaron se na joda jaae
 India's economic reforms are a spectacular museum of unfulfilled efforts
 udaarikaran kii rajat jayanti par beshak hamen fakhr hona chahie ki bharat duniya ke un chuninda mulkon main he jisane dhai dashak main abhootpurv or adbhut uplabdhiyaan hasil kii hai, jo badi hui aay, sevaaon, takneekon, utpaadon, suvidhaon kii shakl main hamaare aasapaas bikhri hai or in sudhaaron kii kamyaabi kii guarantee detii hai
 But in spite of this, the great tragedy of economic reforms is their incompleteness, which, if not, our benefits would probably be many times more and inconsistencies would be many times less
 sabase nae udaarikaran se shuru karte hai
 In June, the Modi government issued an ambitious and far-reaching aviation policy, and shortly thereafter the rules for foreign investment in aviation were also liberalized
 yah donon hi faisle aadhuniktaa or saahas ke paimaanon par utsahvardhak the, kyonki nai niti ke tahat sarkaar ne bhartiya vimaanan companiyon ke liye videshi udaanon ke dakiyanoosee niyamon ko badal diya tha or duusari taraf videshi vimaan companiyon ke liye bazaar kholane kii himmat dikhaai thi
 But even after this improvement remained incomplete
 nai uddyan niti kaa adhuuraapan isliye or zyada mahatvapurn he kyonki bharat main vimaanan kshetra kaa udaarikaran 1990 main prarambh hua
 The open sky policy of 1994 and the end of the monopoly of government companies (air India) in the airline boomed, but despite 26 years of experience, the new aviation policy did not dare the overall liberalization of the sector
 kai nitiyon ke safar ke baavjood vimaanan kshetra ko abhi kuch or nitiyon kaa intjaar karnaa hoga
 The energy and electricity sector is a splendid example of anomalies
 nijee companiyon ko bijli utpaadan kii ijaajat 1992 main (independent power producers niti) or utpaadak istemaal (captive) ke liye koyala nikaalane kii chhot 1993 main mil gai thi
 Power reforms were not completed despite several steps, including the reorganization of state electricity boards in the nineties and the new electricity law in the 2000s
 isi dauraan sarkaar ne koyala kshetra main videshi nivesh kii gati tej kii or captive khadaanon kaa aavanton-ghotaale-punaravanton hue
 Despite all the changes in energy policies, power and energy reforms remained incomplete and complicated
 sarkaar ne utpaadan kaa nijeekaran to kiya lekin bijli vitaran adhikanshtah sarkari niyantran main rahaa
 Governments did not want to leave the politics of fixing electricity rates, so regulators in the electricity sector could not work openly
 duusari taraf bijli utpaadan main nijee nivesh ke baavjood sarkaar ne koyala khanan apane niyantran main rakhaa
 Due to these strange anomalies, India's energy sector became a bundle of controversies, scandals and ghats
 1990 main bijli board ghate main the or rajyon ke bijli vitaran nigam aaj bhi ghate main hai, jinhen pichley 25 saal main teen package mil chuke hai
 The third package is Uday, brought by the Modi government
 bijli kaa utpaadan va aapurti badi he lekin koyala va bijli vitaran ke kshetra main adhure sudhaaron ke kaaran asangatiyaan or zyada bad gai hai
 It is also important to know the story of telecom reforms, which could not reach the result till date despite any policy change almost every other year
 1993 main mobile seva kii shuruyaat se lekar, 1995 main companiyon ko license fees se maafee, tiri kaa gathan, sidime seva, 2ji license, videshi nivesh kaa udaarikaran, 3ji seva, 2ji ghotaalaa, nae spectrum aavanton or 4ji tak doorsanchaar sudhaaron kaa itihaas romaanch se bharaa hua he
 The objective of this liberalization was to bring adequate competition in the market and to provide modern and affordable service to consumers, but the telecom reforms could not be ordered correctly
 sudhaaron ke adhuurepan va tadarthwaad kaa nateeja he ki spectrum ghotaalon ke baavjood sarkarein paardarshee spectrum aavanton niti nahin bana sakin
 TRAI failed to become a successful and transparent regulator, so the market competition (reduced operators' numbers) from 2G to 4G was limited
 seva kii gunvattta bigadi he or seva daren mahangi ho gai hai
 Take the liberalization of retail business as a fourth example, which started in 1997 with 100 per cent foreign investment in cash and carry
 2000 ke dashak main single brands retail main 100 fisadi or multi brands retail main 51 fisadi epadi kholaa gaya lekin siyaasi uhapoh ke kaaran sudhaar puri tarah lagu nahin ho sake
 Meanwhile, the government recently opened 100 percent foreign investment in e-commerce and food retail
 kaagajon par puraa retail kshetra videshi nivesh ke liye khulaa he, lekin prakriyaagat ulajhanon va rajnatik asamanjas ke chalate nivesh nadaarad he
 Due to incomplete, unstructured and inconsistent reforms, India has become an unwilling economy in which the benefits of openness are limited to selective hands and the healthy and egalitarian expansion of the market has been left behind
 is khule bazaar main avasar baantne vaali takat ke taur par sarkaar aaj bhi maujuud he jabaki avasar lene kii hode main lagi companiyaan cartil, netaaon se gathjod or bhrashtachar se is udaarikaran ko aae din daagi karti hai
 British poet John Keats used to say that a good start does not end half the work
 darasal jab tak aadha rasta na mil jaae tak acchhee shuruyaat kaa daawa hi nahin karnaa chahie
 Economic reforms have spared India a lot of rewards but at the bottom of reforms there is a big thorn in incompleteness that forces a healthy country to go limp forever

 ab yah saaf hone laga he ki dilli main bijepi sarkaar banane kii taiyaari kar rahi he
 It is expected to be decided in the next one week
 faisle ke elaan ke liye pradhanmantri narendra modi kii dilli vaapasi kaa intjaar kiya ja rahaa he
 However, sources are saying that there is not an opinion in the BJP to form the government
 party ke ek dhade ko sarkaar banane par koi aitraaj nahin he, jabaki doosraa dhada maanata he ki isse aam aadmi party ko phayda hoga
 Therefore, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will probably decide on this issue
 dilli bijepi ke adhyaksh satish upaadhyaay ne enditivi india se baat karte hue kaha ki philhal hamaare paas sarkaar banane ke liye paryaapt sankhya bal nahin he
 
 
 If the Lt
 Governor calls us, we will see
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki party ke vichaaron ko media ke samaksh saarvajanik karnaa unke liye sahi nahin hoga
 He also mocked Kejriwal's allegations of horse trading
 satish upaadhyaay ne dilli ke bijepi saansadon ke saath mulaakaat kii or aaj bijepi ke vidhayakon se mil rahe hai
 On the other hand, in an advertisement, Aam Aadmi Party leader Arvind Kejriwal is accusing BJP of trying to form a government by manipulating it
 bijepi ke dilli main sarkaar gathan kii raah talashne se judi khabaron ke saamne aane ke saath aam aadmi party (aap) ne us par vidhayakon ko 'kharidne' kii koshish or saudebaaji karne kaa aarope lagaaya
 Aam Aadmi Party leader Ashutosh alleged that BJP is trying shamelessly to buy mlas of other party
 
 
 loktantr, samvidhan kaa makhul udaaya ja rahaa he
 
 
 This assembly should be dissolved; in future the lieutenant governor's reputation should not be discounted
 isse purv aam aadmi party ke sanyojak arvind kejariwal ne mangalvaar ko ek record kiye gaye sandesh main kaha tha, bijepi kai vidhayakon ko 20-20 karod rupee kii peshkash kar ghatiya or aniatik tareekon se sarkaar gathan kii koshish kar rahi he
 Is this democracy? This is completely wrong
 unhone kaha, agar bijepi is tarah aniatik tareekon se or karodon rupee kharch kar sarkaar banaati he, to is tarah kii beyimaan sarkaar aapke bijli ke bill hi badhayegi, bhrashtachar main lipt hogi or mulya vruddhi karegi
 In a message sent by the people through phone calls by AAP, Kejriwal said, will the government be able to provide security to women through cheap methods like bargaining? The former Delhi Chief Minister also targeted the Prime Minister in the message and said, "why is Mr
 Narendra Modi silent?" It's enough
 ab dilli kii janata chup nahin rahegi
 On Kejriwal's allegation, Delhi BJP President Satish Upadhyay said that Kejriwal misled the people of Delhi
 
 
 kejariwal kya bolte hai or kab palat jate hai, ye bataanaa jaruri nahin he
 
 
 It is his habit to make baseless accusations
 ullekhneey he ki dilli main isse pehle disambar, 2013 main chunaav hue the, jinamein saamaajik kaaryakarta se rajaneta bane arvind kejariwal kii aam aadmi party ne shandaar pradarshan kar 28 siten hasil kii thim, or satta main lautne ke prati aashwast dikh rahi bhartiya janata party ko bahumat se pehle 32 siton par roak diya tha
 For this reason, the BJP had to halt the effort to form a government, and finally after several days of struggle Arvind Kejriwal formed the government with the unconditional support of eight Congress mlas

 Apparently, he is feeling insecure like every leader who has gone to the polls but within he is also confident because the news coming from different parts of the state should indicate his historic third term as the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh
 She has been india today-oarji janamat surveykshan ke nateezon se bhi yahi sanket mil rahaa he
 However, after Jyotiraditya Scindia was made the head of the Election Campaign Committee and a rotating Chief Ministerial candidate, there has been some increase in the last round in the Congress' graph
 janamat surveykshan main 230 sadasyeey vidhansabha main chouhan kii bijepi ko 5 pratishat voton main ijapha hone ke sanket ke baavjood 143 siten milane kaa anumaan he, jo 2008 main mili siton ke baraabar hi he

 Chauhan told India Today, "we have implemented these schemes by talking to panchayats
 ye yojanaayen ab hamen ‘‘kalyankari rajy ke kareeb le ja rahi hai
 According to the Central Statistics Organization's 2012-13 preliminary data, Madhya Pradesh 10

 From 5 lakh hectare to 25 lakh hectare, it has tripled

 And the yield of wheat in the state has also tripled
 lekin sindhiya or unki nai-naveli ekajute congress votaron se kah rahi he ki ye aankade jhuthe hai
 There is a dispute on how much crowd gathered in Rahul Gandhi's meeting in Gwalior, a stronghold of Scindia on October 17, in which these figures of the state government were rubbished by Rahul, Scindia and other big leaders
 bijepi netaaon kaa kahana he ki 70,000 kii bheed thi lekin congress kaa daawa he ki 1,50,000 log vahaan pahunche
 The main electoral strategy of the Congress, focusing on the backwardness of the Bundelkhand and Baghelkhand regions, is to create the impression that the story of Madhya Pradesh's progress is nothing more than a good-looking legend
 chouhan aisi baton par hans kar kendriya urja mantralay kii website kaa zikr karte hai, jo bataur rajyamantri (swatantra prabhaar) sindhiya ke jimme he
 He says, "I know what the Congress is saying
" sindhiya ke hi mantralay kii website ke mutabik madhya pradesh main bijli kii sthiti desh main sabase behatar he
 Either its figures are false or they are denying the truth
 ’’ ve sindhiya ke is aarope kaa bhi khandan karte hai ki rajya main krishi paidaavaar ke aankade is vajah se bade hue dikhte hai kyonki rajya sarkaar centre se mili anaaj ko duusare rajyon main bech detii he
 Chauhan asks, "is it child's play to manipulate the figures?" The UPA government gave us the award for agricultural produce
 raashtrapati ne hamen sammanit kiya
 Are these awards given only on fake figures? ”but one allegation is that the state's performance has been very poor on many parameters of the Human Development Index
 masalan, rajya main mahila sakshartaa dar sirf 60 pratishat he, shishu mrityu dar prati 1,000 shishuon main 59 yani rashtriya ausat 44 pratishat se kaaphi adhik he, or aparaadh dar bhi oonchi he
 Chauhan says, "historically Madhya Pradesh has been backward in cases like infant mortality and female-male ratio

 It is true that unfortunate incidents and crimes have occurred especially against women

 "the second problem is corruption
 janamat surveykshan main ise 16 pratishat log sarkaar kii sabase badi vifaltaa maanate hai
 Chauhan argues that there have been more reports of corruption from the state to the bureaucracy because the government is not afraid to curb its officials
 lekin bijepi ke netaa or kaaryakarta aashwast hai ki party ko rajya main bah rahi ‘‘modi lahar’’ se baari badhat mil rahi he
 Chauhan says that there is no doubt that the rallies of the Chief Minister of Gujarat have worked to excite
 ve kehete hai, ‘‘modiji lokapriy jan netaa hai or is sachaai ko jhuthlaayaa nahin ja saktaa
 "though both BJP and Congress are in the process of candidate selection and ticket sharing, this issue has not been seen in the opinion poll, so it will also make a difference
" lekin hawa bijepi ke hi paksh main bahati dikh rahi he, haalanki yah pehle jitani tej nahin rahi, jaisi sindhiya ke maidan main utarane se pehle thi
 So, are there any undercurrents that election analysts are not able to detect? Chauhan says, "we are winning by a good majority
 ’’ iske pehle ve yah bataate hai ki kaise ve agle kaarykaal main rajya main laghu or majhole udyogon ko badhaava dekar krishi par nirbharta kam karenge
 For Chauhan with development plans, the election is not an unsolicited journey, but preparation for another journey

 vitt mantri arun jetali mangalvaar ko is maamle ko lekar bataaya ki rajya petrol or dijal ko jiesti ke daayre main laane ke liye taiyaar nahin hai
 He said that the mood of the states at present is that they do not want to bring petrol and diesel under the purview of GST
 haalanki unhone ummid jataai kiprakritik gas, real estate pehle jiesti ke daayre main laae ja sakate hai
 After these, the number of petrol and diesel can be found somewhere
 unhone kaha ki iske baad ham petrol, dijal, pine yogya alcohol ko bhi iske daayre main laane ke liye prayaas karenge
 The reason for this lack of consensus is that whenever the crude oil prices increase at the international level, it also increases the revenue of the states

 With this, the governments of the state levying lower VAT will not agree to bring petrol and diesel under GST, given their political gains
 kyonki unke saamne jiesti kii vajah se keemten badhane kaa khatra hoga
 In many states, the price will increase in the GST Council, senior sources say that if petrol and diesel are brought under the purview of GST, it will lead to a single tax instead of separate sales tax across the country
 isse bhale hi maharashtra jaise kuch rajyon main thodi raahat milegi, lekin kam waite vasuulne vaale rajyon main petrol or dijal kii keemton main bahut bade str par badhotaree ho jaaegi
 In such a situation, no political party would want to take such a step
 bataa den ki aam aadmi ko ummid thi ki bajet main exise duty ghataakar sarkaar aam aadmi ko raahat degi, lekin aisa nahin hua
 The government first decided to reduce the excise duty on one side and on the other hand, by increasing the cess, the oil prices were equalized
 is bajet main centre sarkaar ne pehle petrol or dijal par lagane vaala basic utpaada shulk (exise duty) ko 2% kam karne kaa faisla liya
 Also, the cess has been increased by 2 rupees
 isse petrol or dijal ke daam jas ke tas rahenge
 The increase in the cess by the government also increased the prices of petrol and diesel
 darasal, exise duty main 2 fisadi kii kami se petrol-dijal 2 rupye sasta ho gaya
 Under this, excise duty 6 on petrol
 48 rupee se ghataakar 4
 Rs 48 and 8 on diesel
 33 rupee se ghataakar 6
 33 per liter
 vahiin, ses (sadak upkar) main do rupee kii badhotaree kii gai he or ise 6 rupye se badhaakar 8 rupee kar diya gaya he

 What was the allegation: Lou Vincent: Tainted cricketer from New Zealand, Lu Vincent, told a London court that former India cricketer Dinesh Mongia was a key member of the four-member gang that used to fix matches during the ICL
 mongia ne tab aisa kaha tha-usne (vincent ne) jo kaha, vah galat he
 i was not involved in any match fixing
 main chandigarh loyns kii ore se khelaa
 But i did not know what the New Zealand players (cairns, Tuffy and Vincent) are doing

 After Delhi, now the demand of returning the Bharat Ratna given to former Prime Minister late Rajiv Gandhi in Punjab is also gaining momentum

 unhone kaha ki captain baar-baar kehete hai ki dangon ke vakt rahul gandhi bachche the lekin 22 saal ke sukhbir badal ko nirdosh nahin maanate jo us vacamerica main shiksha grahan kar rahe the
 On the other hand, rejecting the demand to call a special session of the Assembly on the Rajiv Gandhi case, the Congress has said that the Akali Dal is on the backfoot on the matter of the extortion of religious texts, so it wants to divert attention from the real issues of Punjab by taking up the useless matters

 argedy supremeo lalu prasad yadav ne guuruuvaar ko mukhyamantri nitish kumaar par tanj kasate hue kaha ki vah apane bos (pradhanmantri modi) ko kahkar bihar ke liye vishesh rajya kaa darja kyon nahin dilavaate hai? lalu ne yah bayaan tab diya jab andhra pradesh ko vishesh rajya kaa darja nahin die jane ko lekar telugu desham party ke do mantriyon ne kendriya mantrimandal se istipha de diya
 Responding to the same sarcasm of Lalu, Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi said that if there was a concern for development in the course of lalu-rabri's 15-year rule in Bihar, instead of making personal property for seven books by scandal in Bihar, then the state would be South- Would have stood gracefully in the line of Western states
 susheel modi ne kahaaki agar 15 saal ke lalu-rabari shasankaal main vikaas kii jaraa bhi chintaa kii gai hoti to aaj ke din bina vishesh rajya ke darja ke hi bihar samruddhi ke shikhar par pahunch jaataa
 Lashing out at the Lalu family, Sushil Modi said that those who pushed the poor into the abyss are becoming advocates of the special state today
 modi ne sawaal poocha ki jab bihar ko vishesh rajya kaa darja dene kaa prastaav mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ke netritv vaali endie sarkaar ne vidhanmandal se paarit kara kar centre kiupie sarkaarko saunpa tha to us vakt lalu kii party centre sarkaar main shaamil thi
 So why did the state not get special state status at that time? Sushil Modi said that the central government for the development of the state 1
 65 lakh karod kaa vishesh package diya he
 On the other hand, JDU also attacked lalu-rabri and said that RJD was involved in the Center and Bihar government in 2004, so why did Bihar not get special state status at that time? JDU spokesperson Sanjay Singh issued a statement asking if the Chief Minister Rabri Devi did not want to grant special status to Bihar or Lalu Prasad while a minister at the Center did not want the state to be special Men met statehood? JDU said that Lalu Prasad should answer all these questions

 BJP candidate Giriraj Singh, who defeated CPI candidate Kanhaiya Kumar from Begusarai seat in Bihar, fiercely attacked AIMIM Chief Asaduddin Owaisi
 unhone kaha ki ovaisi jaise logon ne desh main nafrat failaane kaa kaam kiya
 PM Narendra Modi abolished casteism, regionalism
 pehle desh arthvyavastha ke maamle main 11wein number par tha, jo chathe sthaan par aa gaya he
 Now the country will also reach the third, second and first number
 unhone kaha ki ovaisi pakistan kii bhashaa na bolen, desh kii senaaon kaa sammaan karen or desh ko dharm ke aadhaar par na baanten
 Talking to Aaj Tak, he said why Owaisi did not say anything during the UPA government when former PM Manmohan Singh said that the first right on the resources of the country is of the minorities
 unhone kaha ki bijepi or piem narendra modi ne sirf vikaas kii raajnneeti kii he
 In fact, Owaisi told Aaj Tak that now BJP and PM Modi will have to work
 hindutv or rashtrawaad ke naam par bijepi logon ko dhokhaa nahin de sakati
 He manipulated the minds of Hindus
 ovaisi ne kaha ki ab bijepi ko kaam karnaa hoga or jumalebaji se kaam nahin chalegaa
 To this, Giriraj Singh said, the people have voted for BJP at work
 narendra modi sirf vikaas kii baat karte hai or jeet bhi isi se mili he
 Faith is awakened for Modi in the minds of the poor
 unhen ghar, bijli, gas, shauchalay or ayushmaan bharat card mila he
 When asked about Sadhvi Pragya's statement on Godse, she said that majority of the country does not spread hatred
 kya hindu hona gunaah he? garibon ke liye ghar bane, sadak baniin or ayushmaan bharat ke card baante gaye to kisi kaa dharm poochkar nahin die gaye
 On the violence during bjp's victory procession in West Bengal on Friday, he said that when the panchayat elections were held in the state, the candidates were killed and the winning candidates did not even get the rights

 modi sarkaar ke raaj main swiss bainkon main bharatiyon kii jamaa raashi pichley chaar saal main pehali baar badi he
 Last year, the amount reached a billion Swiss francs (rs 7,000 crore)
 lekin ek vakt wo bhi tha, jab swiss bainkon main bharatiyon kaa paisa 41400 karod ke str par pahunch gaya tha
 In the last 12 years, there has been a significant decrease in the amount of money held by Indians in self-banks
 congress raaj main yah aankada ek vakt main record hai par pahunch gaya tha
 In the year 2006, it touched the figure of 41400 crores
 2014 main jab modi sarkaar ai, to us dauraan swiss bainkon main bharatiyon kaa paisa ghatakar 14 hajaar karod par pahunch gaya tha
 It was like this during the Congress rule: Congress was in government in the country from 2004 to 2014
 is dauraan bhi swiss bank main chupe kaale dhan ko lekar charchaa hoti thi
 However, due to the strict rules of self banks at that time, it was difficult to get information about the people who had accounts in these banks
 haalanki dhire-dhire halaat badale or switzraland ke bainkon ne apane niyamon main thodaa dheel dena shuru kiya
 Even in the Congress Raj, the figures decreased: Looking at the figures of the Swiss National Bank, in 2006, the money of Indians in the Swiss Bank has decreased after reaching the record high level of 41400 crores
 2006 ke baad 2007 main yah aankada 27500 karod rupee par pahunchaa
 Similarly, in 2008, 15400 crores, in 2009 12600 crores, in 2010 this figure decreased to 12450 crores
 2011 main phir badi rakam:iske baad 2011 main ek baar phir isamen badhotaree hui or swiss bainkon main bharatiyon kaa paisa badhkar 14000 karod par pahunch gaya
 It again declined in 2012 and came to Rs 9000 crore
 iske baad 2013 main ek baar phir yah aankada 14 hajaar karod par pahunchaa
 When the Modi government took charge of the country in June 2014, the money of Indians in self banks was 10 during this period
 6 fisadi ghatakar 12,615 karod par pahunch gaya tha
 Record fall in Modi Raj: In the 2014 general elections, black money hidden in self banks became the biggest electoral issue
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne kaala dhan waapas laane ko lekar vaade bhi kiye
 After this, many steps were taken to curb black money during the 4 years of the Modi government
 modi sarkaar ke kaarykaal main 2015 main yah aankada 8392 karod par aayaa
 At the same time, it decreased to a record in 2016 and reached the level of Rs 4500 crore
 kya modi sarkaar ke prayaas se hi ai kami?pradhanmantri narendra modi ne apane chaar saal ke kaarykaal main kaale dhan ke khilaaf kai kadam uthaae hai
 But the efforts of the Modi government have not succeeded in this
 swiss bank hameshaa se kaale dhan ke liye sef hewan banane kii vajah se aalochakon ke nishane par rahe hai
 Since 2010, many countries around the world started pressurizing the government to curb those who hide black money by easing their strict rules
 niyamon main dheel se bhi kam hui jamaa raashi:iske baad switzraland ne kaaphi samay tak iskaa virodh kiya, lekin aakhir yahaan kii sarkaar apane banking niyamon main dheel dene ko taiyaar hui
 After this, the Swiss government signed an agreement with several countries
 isamen bharat bhi shaamil he
 Under this treaty, Switzerland agreed to share the information of the account holders of the respective country with certain conditions
 is vajah se kai logon ne swiss bainkon se apana paisa nikaalnaa shuru kar diya
 Banks focus on increasing business domestically: Simultaneously, due to increasing pressure on global level, self banks started focusing on increasing their business domestically
 isliye inhone na sirf videshiyon ke liye paisa rakhane ke niyamon ko kadaa kiya, balki apana focus desh main hi seva dene par bhi shift kiya
 Somewhere along with this, deposits of other countries, including India, were reduced in self-banks

 in / The Foreign Ministry said, European mps had expressed a desire to understand India, on Sidhu said, about going to Kartarpur, you have to understand that you are going to Pakistan, many opposition parties have expressed opposition on the visit of European mps to Kashmir
 iske jawaab main videsh mantralay ne apana bayaan jari kiya he
 The Ministry of External Affairs said on Thursday that it is the right of the MEA (ministry of External Affairs) to invite the people of civil society
 kai baar log apane nijee yatra par aate hai
 Many times we engage them officially in the national interest, even if they are on private visits
 ' videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa raveesh kumaar ne kaha, 'MEP (europea saansad) ne bharat ko jaanane samajhane kii ichha jataai thi
 When he approached them through different mediums, there were people of different ideologies
 unhen kashmir jane main saport kiya gaya tha
 On the other hand, China on Thursday termed the division in the two union territories of Jammu and Kashmir as "illegal and meaningless" and objected to it
 china ne kaha ki bharat kii ore se china ke kuch hisse ko apane prashasnic adhikaar kshetra main 'shaamil' karnaa beijing kii samprabhutaa ko 'chunauti' he
 To this, India responded that Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh are integral parts of India about which any other country should refrain from commenting
 kartarpur sahib or pakistankartarpur sahibamaamle main videsh mantralay ne kaha, tirthayatra ke liye samjhauta hua he
 Shortly thereafter, the Ministry of Home Affairs has shared the list of the first batch from Pakistan
 is bare main abhi unki taraf se koi jawaab nahin aayaa he
 Process is probably going on in this regard
 videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa ke mutabik, udghaatan kii taiyaariyaan jari hai
 We will share once the final decision is taken
 kartarpur sahib jane vaale netaaon ke bare main mantralay ne kaha, pehle jatthe main centre or rajya sarkaar ke netaaon ne naam hai
 China has issued a statement on dividing jammu-kashmir into two distinct answers
 china ne kaha he ki jammu-kashmir or ladakh centre shasit pradeshon kaa gathan 'gaiyr-kanoonee or nirarthak' he
 Foreign Ministry spokesman Ravish Kumar said, "china is well aware of India's clear position on this issue
" jammu-kashmir ke punargathan kii baat puri tarah se bharat kaa aantarik maamla he
 We do not expect comments from other countries, including China, on India's internal affairs, just as India too refrains from commenting on the affairs of other countries
 jammu-kashmir or ladakh ke sangh shasit pradesh bharat ke abhinn hissaa hai
 On the news of Sidhu's statement about Navnjot Singh Sidhu, the Ministry of External Affairs said, "it is important to understand about going to Kartarpur that you are going to Pakistan
" lihaaja jise bhi janaa he use pataa hona chahie ki kis tarah kii clearence lee jaani chahie
 People who need political clearance know the way
 britain main bharat ke khilaaf hue virodh pradarshan par videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa ne kaha, euke main jis tarah pradarshan hue, hinsak ghatnaayen huin, us maamle ko hamane euke sarkaar ke saath uthaaya tha
 We do not think this is an end-to-end issue as it is backed by Pakistan-backed groups hating India
 aise main yah UK ke liye bhi sochane kaa mudda he ki kisi duusare desh ke bahekaave main aakar agar unke naagarik bharat jaise mulk ke khilaaf pradarshan kar rahe hai, to yah unke liye bhi chintaa kaa vishay he

 Imran was heard under sections of terrorism

 In Pakistan, gang rape and murder cases often come before the anti-terrorism court

 The reason for this was to complete the hearing of the case at the earliest

 In this, all four accused were sentenced to death
 isse pehle, 11 march ko maamle ke mukhya aaropee ram singh ne dilli kii tihaad jail main khudakushi kar lee thi
 The hearing is still continuing
 The Fast Track Court sent its decision to the Delhi High Court and on 13 March 2014, the Delhi High Court upheld the decision
 2 june ko do doshiyon ne supreme court main apil kii or 11 july 2016 se is maamle kii sunwaayee supreme court main shuru hui
 On 5 May 2017, the Supreme Court upheld the death sentence of the four convicts
 is maamle main ab bhi supreme court main sunwaayee jari he

 When Tariq Anwar left the party, NCP leader Praful Patel said that he did not inform us before this decision, it was also shocking for us
 patel ne kaha ki ham unhen manaane kii koshish karenge taaki vah dobaaraa ham saath jud saken
 On Pawar's statement, he said that he has not said anything wrong
 rafel kii technical baaten saamne laana thik nahin he, kyonki hamen use dushman ke khilaaf istemaal karnaa he
 Patel said that JPC should be formed before making any allegations because JPC will investigate every factor of the price
 NCP netaa bole ki sharad pavaar desh ke raksha mantri rah chuke hai, vah aise hi bina kisi jaankaree ke bayaan dena pasand nahin karte hai
 Every leader has a different method, it does not mean that we are not opposing BJP
 bharat band ke dauraan bhi sharad pavaar rahul gandhi ke saath hi the
 Patel said that Pawar's statement was misrepresented, which is not correct
 prafull patel bole ki jaruri nahin he ki jo bayaan congress de, anya partiyaan bhi unke jaisaa hi bayaan den
 Each party has its own different method
 agar bijepi kii baat karen to ham unase kai muddon par lard rahe hai, petrol-dijal ke daam, mahangaai par ham unhen gher rahe hai

 china or north east ke kai ilaakon main insaan kute katkar khate hai
 Such news is often heard
 lekin bharat ke kuch rajyon main in dinon kute aadamkhor ho gaye hai
 And they are eating humans by scolding them
 is tarah ke maamalon ne logon ko dahala diya he
 Police administration is also being held responsible for this behavior of dogs towards humans
 beete saal aise hi kuch maamle saamne aae hai
 20 August 2016 In Kerala, the terror of dogs has made people live
 vahaan aawaara kutton ne ek mahila ko apana shikaar banaaya
 The woman died in this attack
 ye ghatana tiruvanantpuram sachivalay se mahaj 20 kilometre dur sthit pulluvilla main hui thi
 People were stunned by this incident
 jahaan 65 varshiya shiluamma samudr tat ke paas bane shauchalay kaa istemaal karne gai thi
 Meanwhile, dozens of dogs attacked Shiluamma
 jisase unki maut ho gai gai thi
 Shortly after the death of Shiluamma on the same day, another woman named Daisy was also attacked by dogs in Thiruvananthapuram
 daiji is hamale main batch to gai lekin wo gambhir rup se ghayal ho gai thim
 He was admitted to the hospital
 kai dinon tak ilaaj ke baad wo thik ho pain
 But this incident had shocked him
 29 june 2016jharkhand ke sabase bade aspataal rajendra institute of medical science yani 'rems' main ek navjaat shishu ko aawaara kutton ne apana shikaar bana liya
 It is said that a couple had wrapped their child in red clothes and left them in the premises of Rheims, where he became a victim of dogs
 haalanki, navjaat jinda tha yaa mrit is baat pataa nahin chal paaya tha
 But when the incident came to light, Chief Minister Raghuvar Das ordered an inquiry
 is ghatana ko aawaara kutton ne anjaam diya tha
 Surprisingly, a heavy force of 450 security personnel is deployed in the hospital premises for security
 baavjood iske kisi kii najar un kutton par nahin padi thi or ek bebas navjaat ko kutton ne noch-nochakar apana niwala bana daalaa tha
 19 June 2015 The dead body of a seven-year-old student of the first class was found in the market Khala police station area in Lucknow, capital of Uttar Pradesh
 wo baccha ek din pehle se laapata tha
 Stray dogs had badly bitten her corpse
 maukey kaa manjar dekhakar logon kaa dil kaanp uthaa tha
 The dogs were eating the child's body
 vah baccha sandigdh paristhiti main ghar se laapata ho gaya tha
 When he was not found after much research, the family informed the police
 ek din baad uske ghar ke paas khaali pade plat main uski laash mili thi
 Whom the dogs were thinking about
 police ke mutabik kisi ne bachche kii hatya kii thi lekin aawaara kutton ne uski laash ko behaal kar diya tha
 On May 15, 2015, stray dogs in Hamirpur district of Uttar Pradesh killed and killed a newborn baby
 police ke mutabik ek kaliyugi maa ne 'loklaj' ke kaaran apane jigar ke tukade ko kutton ke hawaale kar diya tha
 The police had sent the remaining part of the body of the infant for the post-mortem by punching it
 maamla sumerpur kasbe kaa tha
 On May 14, on a highway near the highway in front of Gayatri Tapobhumi, people drinking tea stared at a dog which was standing near a drain which was choking a dead newborn baby
 logon ke shor machaane par kutta shishu ke shav ko chhodkar dur chalaa gaya, jiske baad logon ne police ko soochna di gai
 But even when the police reached the spot, two or three dogs were eating the body with a bruise
 police ne kutton bhagaaya or shav ko postmortem ke liye bheja
 Repeated incidents like these have forced the police administration to think as well
 haalanki is maamle ko lekar kai baar awaz bhi uthaai gai hai
 In Kerala, a public decree has been issued to kill stray dogs
 jiske baad vahaan janata or sarkari karmchaariyon ne hi sankadon kutton ko maut kii neend sula diya
 But there is a lot of controversy about this order as well
 kyonki pashu premi is tarah ke aadesh ke khilaaf sadakon par utarkar morcha khol rahe hai

 Since the Batla House scandal in Delhi in 2008, many houses in Sanjarpur village of Azamgarh have the same atmosphere
 gaanv ke 11 yuvakon par aatankwaad ke aarope lagane ke baad yahaan ke log ‘‘aatankwaadiyon kaa gaanv’’ jaisi badnuma pahchaan se dhak gaye hai
 That is why the bjp's prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi's special Amit Shah called Azamgarh a stronghold of terrorists, the wounds once again turned green

 phir bhi suraksha agenciyaan mujhase, mere bacchon se or rishtedaaron se uske bare main puuchhati rahati hai
 Hey, when our phones are being tapped, you have an eye on our every action, then before you (security agencies) you will find it
 ’’ iske baad shahanvaj kaa becoground or uske paak-saaf hone kii daleelein dete-dete unka galaa rundh gaya
 These are the arguments on which the court has the right to object or not, but what will happen in the court when the accused is missing? Shahnawaz is not alone
 batla house encounter ke baad gaanv ke mohammad shajid, mohammad khalid or abu raashid laapata hai
 They are accused of carrying out bomb blasts in Delhi, Jaipur and Ahmedabad
 iske alaava teen ladke saf, salmaan ahamed or aarif aatankwaad ke aaropon main jail main band hai
 Atif and Chhota Sajid who were killed in this encounter were also from this village
 gaanv ke do ladakon raashid or shaadaab ahamed ke khilaaf enie ne gaiyr jamaanti warrant nikaal rakhaa he
 The situation is that if strangers come to the village and if they have a camera in their hands then the children understand, the media has come and if they are empty handed then the children understand, the team of NIA (national Investigative Agency) has come
 is tarah ke maansik traas se guzar rahe gaanv ke masihuddin sanjri yaad dilaate hai, ‘‘jis raashid ke khilaaf enie ne gaiyr-jamaanti warrant nikaala he, vah to 2007 se hi yuai main he
 "some of the same arguments are given by Chhota Sajid's brother Shakir, who has been missing since the Batla House encounter," he wanted to go to Saudi Arabia for work

 He then did a diploma in jewelery

 Shankar says frankly, "I don't know what people think outside, but we have no fear in the village
" ’’ vaise bhi unke zyaadaatar graahak musalmaan hi hai
 When we started walking from the village, many villagers returned to complete the namaz and came to talk
 unki baatcheej kaa saar yahi tha ki hamen or zyada ‘‘mashhoor’’ mat kariye
 If we will be seen with such skepticism in our country, then how will we live? aatankwaad ke maamalon main hindu or musalmaan kaa bhed na ho
 When most of the people are acquitted of the charges, then they should stop keeping them in Salosal Jail and make the entire family a traitor to the country

 chayan prakriya se baahar kiye jane ke kaarnon main musalamaanon ke khilaaf pakshpatpurna drushtikon rakhane ke saath hi kai anya kaaran shaamil rahe
 Judge James Leinenweber interviewed potential jurors throughout the day
 lininewebar ne saakshaatkaar ke dauraan mukhyarup se yah jaanane kii koshish kii ki sambhavit juri sadsy islam ke bare main or musalamaanon ke bare main kahin nakaaratmak drushtikon to nahin rakhte
 While most of the potential jurors said they had no animosity with Islam and Muslims, there were others who said that they do not respect Islam
 sankhya-14 vaala sambhavit juri sadsy aisa hi tha
 In the question table that was submitted to the possible 100 jurors on May 16, this particular member probably wrote, "terrorists are predominantly Muslim, am i misinformed?" The judge immediately dismissed this candidate in the interest of a fair hearing for Rana
 niztaa or nijee suraksha ko dhyaan main rakhte hue juri sadasyon kii pahchaan ke liye sankhyaon kaa istemaal kiya gaya he
 The candidate with the number 15 was dropped because she could not be impartial due to a strict view of Islam
 vah dakshin purv asian mul kii mahila thim
 Another possible jury member, number 21, was dismissed because he had a moral problem in passing judgment on others
 unke baad vaale ummidavaar ne kaha ki use daant or kandhe main baraabar dard rahata he, jiske kaaran vah haath main aae kaam par dhyaan kendrit nahin kar pate
 He said that since he is unemployed, he has not been able to get any health insurance
 in mahashay ko bhi chayan prakriya se baahar kar diya gaya
 Jury member number-28 was a woman
 unhen isliye mukt kar diya gaya, kyonki unhone bataaya ki ek pulicekarmi dwaara unki bahan kii kathitarup se hatya kiye jane ke baad se unki dimagi haalat thik nahin he
 Similarly, Jury No
 36 was dismissed because she said she does not believe in the government and the problem of terrorism has been exaggerated
 nyaayadhish ne chayan prakriya ke dauraan sambhavit juri sadasyon se yah bhi sawaal poocha ki kya ve america nagarikon or gaiyr america nagarikon ke liye samaan kanoonee adhikaar chaahate hai yaa nahin
 Many were unsure about it, but there were many who were against equal rights, while the US Constitution guarantees equal rights

 Rana (50) was present in the courtroom along with his lawyers and smiled at some of the responses of potential jurors
 kabhi-kabhi vah kuch likhata tha
 The jury selection process is likely to go on till Thursday

 maidan par kaaphi chijen hoti hai jinamein se kuch aap maukey kii garmi main kar dete hai
 'kohli said,' But you don't know what to do if you add one or two or three digits to your account
 isliye mujhako lagata he ki aajkal iraade par gaur kiya jaataa he or khilaadi ko ise dhyaan main rakhana chahie
 It may be a small thing but if the intention is to do something wrong then of course it goes against the player

 ) In Rajasthan, Congress will follow the path of BJP, the minister will sit in the Congress office for 20 days, Congress minister will hear the problem of Congress workers
 bijepi shashan ke dauraan jis baat ko lekar congress bijepi ko kos rahi thi use ab rajasthan congress ke daftar main bhi lagu kiya jayega
 All ministers will sit for 20 days in the Jaipur office of Rajasthan Congress for the work of the workers, where Congress workers will be heard on the lines of BJP
 sanghathan or satta ke bich hue ko-ordination kii baithak main faisla kiya gaya he ki mantri jaipur main rahete hai to maheene ke 20 din apane daftar jane se pehle congress ke daftar main baithkar congressi kaaryakartaaon kii samasya sunenge or use dur karenge
 Apart from this, if any minister visits any district, the district will go to the Congress office and listen to the workers there
 darasal, congress ke pradesh adhyaksh or rajya ke up-mukhyamantri sachin payalat kii taraf se yah shikaayat kii gai thi ki rajya main congress kii sarkaar to ban gai he magar congressi kaaryakartaaon kii puch nahin ho rahi he
 In view of this, it was decided in the meeting of Congress General Secretary-in-charge Avinash Pandey with Sachin Pilot and Ashok Gehlot that from now on, the Congress ministers will stay in Jaipur, if they sit in the Congress office and if outside Jaipur, they will sit in the District Congress office
 rajasthan main loksabhaa chunaav haarane ke baad congress sthaneey nikaay ke chunaav se pehle apane kaaryakartaaon main josh bharna chaahati he lihaaja kaaryakartaaon ko charge karne ke unki samasyaon kii sunwaayee kii muhim shuru kii gai he
 This exercise will also accelerate the membership drive of the Congress
 isse pehle jab congress kii sarkaar bani thi tab mukhyamantri ashok gahalot ne yah aadesh nikaala tha ki rajya ke sabhi mantri apane awaas par subah jansunwaayee karenge, taaki isamen bijepi or congress ke kaaryakarta kaa bhed nahin ho paae or sabhi log aakar mantri ke yahaan apni samasya kah saken
 In it, it was said that we will not listen to our own workers in our office like the BJP
 yah parampara pichhali bijepi sarkaar ke dauraan shuru hui thi
 In this, BJP ministers used to sit in BJP office and listen to BJP workers
 uske liye unhen bijepi ke kaaryakarta hone kaa pramaan patr dena padataa tha
