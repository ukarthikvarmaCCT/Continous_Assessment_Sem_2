 a post shared by Sidharth Malhotra (@s1dofficial) on Dec 7, 2017 at 4:10am PST The wedding of Kapaldipika Padukone and Ranveer Singh, Bollywood's most prominent church has been revealed
 donon stars ne soshal media par special card share karte hue apni shaadi kii taarikh kaa elaan kar diya he
 Deepika and Ranveer's wedding ceremony will take place on November 14 and 15
 is khabar ke saamne aate hi dipavir ke naam se phens ke bich mashhoor is kapal ko badhaiyaan milani shuru ho gai hai
 Firstly, Deepika was given the wedding greetings by Sonam Kapoor and Karan Johar
 sonam kapur ne likhaa, bahut sara pyaar
 Karan Johar congratulated Naranveer Singh and wrote, "lots and pots of love xxrep 6 ! Badhai Ho xxrep 6 ! "
 tiger shroff ne donon stars ko badhai dete hue pyaar bhar imoji banaaya or likhaa, "congratulation xxrep 4 s ,"deepika ranvir kii shaadi kaa card saamne aate hi viral ho gaya he
 About 5 lakh people have liked this card in 1 hour
 card kii sabase khaas baat ye he ki ise hindi or angreji donon bhashaaon main jari kiya gaya he
 As soon as the news of the wedding comes, the whole Bollywood is congratulating both the stars in a big way
 bataa den ummid kii ja rahi thi ki donon stars ek privet seremani main italy main saat phere le sakate hai
 Only 30 guests will be invited to this dream wedding
 reports ke mutabik is shaadi main mehmaanon ko phone le jane kii manjuuri nahin di jaaegi
 The reason for this is to keep all the rituals related to marriage personal
 BCCI adhyaksh shashaank manohar ke safai abhiyaan main indian cricket team ke acting diarector ravi shastri, purv cricketer sunil gavaskar or team india ke vanade captain mahendra singh dhoni ko nuksaan uthaanaa pad saktaa he
 In fact, there are at least three such points in the conflict of interest rules that will come into effect from 9 November which will harm all three
 ped comentator ko BCCI main post nahiin niyamon ke mutabik koi bhi ped comentator bisisiai main (ipel samet) kisi bhi post par nahin rah saktaa
 Let us tell you that besides being a paid commentator, Ravi Shastri is also a member of the Governing Council of IPL
 9 november se in niyamon ke lagu ho jane ke baad unhen gavarning council or comentry main se ek ko chunanaa hoga jo ki unke liye kaaphi mushkil sabit hone vaala he
 Reduced paid income of paid comentator! BCCI paid com- mentator cannot have any connection with print or electronic media
 gauratlab he ki sunil gavaskar aksar tivi shoj main jate rahete hai or iske saath hi wo vibhinn akhabaaron ke liye bhi likhte rahete hai
 Gavaskar, who received crores of rupees every year for commentary from the BCCI, may now have to give up his extra earnings
 duusare player ko manage karne vaali company se durine niyamon ke mutabik koi bhi cricketer duusare kisi bhi indian cricketer ko manage karne vaali company se link nahin rakh saktaa
 Now everyone knows that Dhoni, Ravindra Jadeja, Bhuneshwar Kumar, Pragyan Ojha, Mohit Sharma, Karn Sharma, and KL Rahul manage all of them at Riti Sports
 iske saath hi purv bisisiai adhyaksh en shrinivasana ko bhi in niyamon se nuksaan uthaanaa pad saktaa he kyonki inamen saaf he ki bisisiai main laabh ke pad par asin kisi bhi vyakti ke parivaar ke kisi bhi sadsy ke hiton kaa takaraav nahin hona chahie

 inputah bhashaa se The results of the recent by-elections in 10 seats of the Bihar Assembly can be termed as a combination of success of RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav and JD (U) leader Nitish Kumar
 loksabhaa chunaavon main lalu or nitish ko chankane vaali haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 Their reconciliation has now turned into a formidable alliance of lalu-nitish-congress after capturing six seats in the by-elections
 vahiin up chunaav main bijepi ko chaar hi siton par santosh karnaa padaa jo 2010 main jiti uski siton se do kam he
 This is a big loss for the saffron camp as the BJP should have won eight seats given the Lok Sabha performance
 saaf he ki nitish-lalu or peeche-peeche congress ke saath ho jane se bihar main bijepi kii takat aadhi rah gai he
 But the results of the by-election are seen more as a BJP defeat than a victory for lalu-nitish
 bijepi saaf taur par loksabhaa chunaav main mili voton ko sahejane main naakaam rahi
 It had won the trust of the voters in the Lok Sabha elections and its alliance won 31 out of 40 Lok Sabha seats in the state
 par vahi bharosa banaae rakhane main vah naakaam rahi
 The biggest manifestation of his failure is the drop in the voting percentage of the by-elections
 21 agast ko hue upachunaavon main 46 pratishat votaron ne vot diya jo loksabhaa chunaav main in 10 vidhansabha kshetron ke matdaan pratishat 52
 05 to 6
 05 pratishat kam he
 6 in voting percentage
 05 pratishat kii yah kami bijepi ke mat pratishat main 7
 The reason for the decrease was 6 percent
 matdaan pratishat main ai giravat bijepi kii haar kii pramukh vajah isliye he kyonki party ne un saat siton, jahaan matdaan pratishat 45 pratishat yaa adhik rahaa, main se chaar siten jiti hai jabaki un teenon siton, jahaan matdaan 45 pratishat se kam hua, par use haar mili he
 For BJP, these figures are alarming because it indicates that most of the voters who voted in Lok Sabha elections who did not turn out to vote in the by-elections were BJP supporters
 bhagava khemaa apane samarthakon ko apane gharon se nikaal paane main naakaam rahaa
 This does not just mean the weakening of the state BJP leadership, a senior BJP leader admitted, "BJP supporters not going to vote can also be a sign of Narendra Modi's decline in attraction
 aakhir modi sarkaar abhi tak mudrasphiti par ankush lagane yaa pramukh vaadon main se ek bhi vaada puraa karne main naakaam rahi he
 "looks like BJP also made a mistake by trying to match Lalu's much hyped and aggressive Mandal politics
 samikarnon kaa dhyaan rakh pratyaashee utaarne kii kavayad main bijepi lalu-nitish gathbandhan se alag dikh paane main naakaam rahi or savarna jatiyon ke apane mul voton se bhi haath dho baithi
 The lalu-nitish alliance fielded four upper caste candidates and all of them won
 isse yah raay pukhta hui ki paaramparik rup se bijepi samarthak maane jane vaale savarna voter bhi paala badal sakate hai
 a BJP MLA said, “how did you think that Yadav would once again leave Lalu and join hands with BJP? After all, there is not a single Yadav minister from Bihar in Modi's cabinet
 itnaa hi nahin, bijepi ke ghoshit becoward-samarthak jhukaav ke chalate chhapra ke rajput votaron ne argedy ummidavaar kaa samarthan kiya
 The results of the by-election also show a major change in the mood of Bihar
 2014 loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ke netritv vaala endie 171 vidhansabha siton par aage rahaa tha
 RJD was ahead in 29 seats while JD (U) candidates were ahead in only 17 assembly constituencies
 upachunaav kaa pehla asar padosi jharkhand main dekha ja sakegaa jahaan isi saal vidhansabha chunaav hone hai
 Due to adverse Bihar results, the BJP leadership in Jharkhand may have to reconsider its decision in which it rejected coalition proposals in the hope of repeating the Lok Sabha performance
 bijepi ke liye sabase bada jhatka party kaa garh maani jane vaali bhagalpur seat par uski haar rahi
 Though the BJP candidate from Bhagalpur Lok Sabha constituency Shahnawaz Hussain lost the election, but from Bhagalpur assembly constituency, he recorded a lead of 32,375 votes
 koi aashcharya nahin ki is baar bhagalpur main sabase kam 37 pratishat matdaan hua
 bjp's defeat in Chhapra is also no less disappointing as Rajiv Pratap Rudy of BJP registered a lead of 38,256 votes over Rabri Devi of RJD in this assembly constituency
 upachunaav main rajput votaron ne vahaan prabhunath singh ke bete or argedy pratyaashee ranbir kumaar singh ko jitaane ke liye apane paaramparik virdohi yadavon se haath mila liya

 en
 Gupta got second place
 jaahir he, shahanvaj or rudi donon hi upachunaav main party pratyaashiyon ko apane vot nahin dilaa paae
 bjp's aide Ram Vilas Paswan from the Hajipur assembly seat, where he was leading by 56,804 votes, can be satisfied with the victory of the BJP candidate
 lekin parbatta se unhen apni party ke pratyaashee ke 56,000 voton ke antar se haarane kii asahaj sthiti kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 In the Lok Sabha elections, BJP had a successful alliance with Paswan's Lok Janshakti Party and Upendra Kushwaha's Rashtriya Lok Samata Party
 par upachunaav main usne paswan ko sirf ek or kushvaha ko ek bhi seat nahin di jisase unke paaramparik samarthakon kaa josh jaataa rahaa
 The bjp's insistence on contesting the by-elections on its own terms helped lalu-nitish stop its social expansion
 loksabhaa nateezon ne dikhaaya tha ki kaise shahari or baniyaa-brahman kii party bijepi vyapak saamaajik aadhaar vaali party ban gai thi
 But in the by-elections, the lalu-nitish alliance was successful in garnering votes of Yadav, Muslim and extremely backward castes
 haalanki yah kahana jaldbaaji hogi ki mahagathbandhan modi or bijepi ke rajnatik sameekaran ke khilaaf safalataa kii kunjee ban chukaa he
 The results of the by-elections are crucial for the RJD and JD (U) as it was offered as a referendum on their alliance
 janata ne ise kubul bhi kiya
 Nitish's blunt response was, "harmony has won and the frenzy has lost
" dekhie aage kya hota he
 Both Lalu and Nitish managed to get their original votes to each other
 duusari taraf bijepi ne lalu-nitish gathbandhan ko jangal raaj kii bhoomika ke taur par prachaarit kiya, lekin votaron ne is ore dhyaan hi nahin diya
 Lalu also tweeted about this, "our government is run by the poor, not the bourgeoisie, so our poor rule is considered a jungle rule
" ” bihar vidhansabha main argedy ke 24 ke mukaable jedy (you) ke 119 vidhayak hai
 RJD won three of its four contested seats while JD (U) won two out of four in the by-elections in terms of success rate
 aise main agle vidhansabha chunaav main lalu netritv kaa daawa kar sakate hai
 The victory of the jdu-rjd-congress alliance has raised hopes of the Congress along with regional parties
 teen maah pehle modi ke haathon maat khaane ke baad ye partiyaan astitv ke sankat kaa saamana kar rahi hai
 At the moment, the BJP can console itself with the fact that the results of the assembly by-elections in the state's history have rarely been repeated in the main election
 bijepi netaa susheel kumaar modi ne kaha bhi, “nattejey hamaari apekshaaon se kharaab hai
 We expected to win at least 6 out of 10 seats
 magar nitish kumaar kii khushi bevajaah he
 The BJP will emerge strong in the assembly elections next year
 ” phir bhi aktubar, 2015 main hone vaale vidhansabha chunaavon ke liye bijepi ko apni ranneeti par nae sire se kaam karnaa hoga
 Not only Bihar, the results of the by-elections in Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh have also shocked the BJP
 karnataka main jahaan use teen main se ek hi seat mili or baaki donon siten congress ke paale main chali gayi, vahiin madhya pradesh main teen siton main se ek se vah haath dho baithi
 The BJP will have to reflect on the results of the by-elections and understand that the Modi wave is now slowing down

 prabhu is vrath se prasann hokar sadhak ko anant punya dete hai
 Fasting on the Ekadashi of Krishna Paksha of Jyeshtha month is a law to worship Lord Vishnu
 is ekadshi ko aparaa ekadshi ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 One meaning of Apara Ekadashi is that the virtue of this Ekadashi is immense
 is ekadshi kaa vrath karne se log paapon se mukti hokar bhavasaagar se tar jate hai
 In the Puranas, it is said about the fast of Ekadashi that a person should not eat after sunset in the evening on Dashami
 raat main bhagwaan kaa dhyaan karte hue sona chahie
 On the day of Ekadashi, one should worship Lord Vishnu after getting up in the morning and taking a bath
 puja main tulsidal, shrikhand chandan, gangaajal va falon kaa prasad arpit karnaa chahie
 The fasting person should avoid blasphemy, lies, deceit and deceit throughout the day
 jo log kisi kaaran vrath nahin rakhte hai, unhen ekadshi ke din chaaval nahin khaanaa chahie
 The person who recites 'vishnushahasranama' on Ekadashi has special blessings of Lord Vishnu

 While hearing the case of air pollution in the capital Delhi, the Delhi High Court has issued a notice to the Resident Commissioner of UP Haryana Punjab Rajasthan
 hoicourt ne poocha ki crop burning ko lekar inke paas kya taiyaari he
 The same Delhi government presented the report of satellite photographs of the last 5 years in the court
 report ke mutabik haryana or punjab kii taraf se crop burning ko lekar uthne vaale smog se sabase zyada dilli prabhavit hoti he
 After the report of the Delhi government, the High Court said that in this situation, the living age limit of the people is reduced by 5 years
 jisamen bachche or bujurgo ke sehat par sabase zyada asar padataa he
 During the last hearing also, in order to reduce air pollution in Delhi, the High Court had said that harvesting will start after Diwali and then it will be burnt in the fields itself
 dilli ke baahar ke pradeshon se aane vaala pradooshan phir dilli ko pradooshit kare usase pehle kendriya pradooshan board ko rajyon ke saath milakar ise rokane ke liye qadam uthaaye jaae
 The High Court said that pollution coming from Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh has an effect on Delhi's Aabo air
 hai court ne kaha ki jab fasal ko jalaana bain he to phir aakhir kisaan fasalon ko kyon jala rahe hai
 And why the Central Pollution Board is not strictly following this order from the state governments
 kendriya pradooshan board ne kaha ki ye zimmedaari rajya sarkaron kii he
 The court said that burning the crop is the cheapest and simplest solution for the farmers
 sarkaar kyon unhen koi or vaikalpik upaay nahin de rahi he
 Government can give any subsidy to them or they should be fined so that they do not burn crops themselves
 hai court dilli main lagaataar bad rahe vaayu pradooshan se judi ek yachika par sunwaayee kar rahaa he
 The court said that on the next hearing, the court wants to know from all the parties how to prevent crop burning

 goa film festival main isliye nahin dikhaai gai 'neude' or 'es durga'is film ko 12 se 18 oktober 2017 ko mumbai film festival main dikhaae jane kii anumati nahin di gai thi
 Even then, the ministry had turned down the request of MAMI (mumbai Academy of Film Image) to show the film

 Tensions between India and Pakistan have increased after the terrorist attack on Uri and then the Indian Army's targeted attack across the Line of Control, due to which the issue was discussed on the sidelines of the BCCI special general meeting
 bisisiai adhyaksh anuraag thakur ne kaha tha, ‘sarkaar ne pakistan ko alag-thalag karne kii nai ranneeti apanaai he
 Keeping in mind the sentiments of him and the general public of the country, we have urged the ICC not to put India and Pakistan in the same group in multinational tournaments
 ’ He also said that if both teams reach the semi-finals and face each other, then it will be a different situation which cannot be avoided

 Renu Jogi, wife of former Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Ajit Jogi, may soon give a Tata buy-by to the Congress
 philhal wo bilaspur ke kota vidhansabha seat se congress kii vidhayak hai
 Twice in a row, she has reached the assembly after defeating the BJP candidate from this seat
 lekin teesri baar varsh 2018 main hone walevidhansabha chunaavamein wo is seat se congress kii ummidavaar banengi, isaki ummid behad kam he
 Actually, Renu Jogi, along with her husband Ajit Jogi, is seen on every platform from which Ajit Jogi is cursing the Congress and BJP
 manch se apane virodhiyon ko hamalaa karte vakt jogi ne sanket bhi diya he ki renu jogi uske saath hai
 Jogi's MLA son and daughter-in-law, along with other leaders of the party, were also present at this forum, adorned in Pendra, Bilaspur
 mauka tha jogi congress kichhattisgarhdhikaar yatra kaa
 With the presence of Renu Jogi in this program, the Congress is in a bind
 haalanki party pehle se hi maanakar chal rahi he ki renu jogi bhi unke pati or vidhayak putr kii tarj par congress chhod sakati he
 Therefore, Congress has not expressed any reaction regarding this program
 pradesh congress adhyaksh bhupesh baghel ne sirf itnaa hi kaha he ki renu jogi ne is rajnatik manch ko kyon saajha kiya, ise party dekhegi
 Ajit Jogi, on the other hand, has already publicly stated that Renu Jogi is his wife and cannot separate from her
 keval vidhayak pad ke sanvaidhanik kaarnon ke chalate wo abhi unki party main shaamil nahin ho pai hai
 It is clear that Renu Jogi remains in the Congress only to retain the membership of the Legislative Assembly
 chhattisgarh main varsh 2018 menvidhansabha chunaavhone hai
 Hence BJP and Congress have intensified attacks on each other
 mukhya muqabla donon hi partiyon ke bich hone ke asaar hai
 But to spoil their equation, political parties like AAP Party, Chhattisgarh Swabhiman Party, BSP, Sarva Adivasi Morcha, NCP and Jogi Congress are also pushing for their presence

 tikat bantwaare se lekar tamaam muddon par congress or patidaaron ke bich sahmati nahin ban pai he
 Now in this episode, former Congress ally NCP (nationalist Congress Party) has also announced to contest separately in Gujarat
 party ke varisht netaa prafull patel ne kaha ki congress party se kai dinon tak gathbandhan par baatcheet chali thi lekin unki ore se koi majboot jawaab nahin mila
 Patel said that the Congress did not show seriousness about the alliance, hence the NCP has now decided to contest the elections alone
 unhone kaha ki rajya main ensipi apni sthiti ko or majubat karne ke iraade se utregi
 Praful Patel said that there is an anti-incumbency wave in Gujarat and if the opposition parties come together and fight, it can benefit
 unhone kaha ki congress party ne bina baatcheet kiye apaneummidavaaron kaa elankar diya, yahaan tak ki un ilaakon main bhi jahaan ensipi ke kaaryakarta kaaphi mehnat kar rahe hai

 All the top players of Indian tennis are now trying their luck at Wimbledon and it is also seen as an Olympic preparation
 is bich mahesh bhupati ne sania ke behad kade khat par apni pratikriya dekar pehle se chal rahe vivaad ko or hawa de di he
 Mahesh Bhupathi also hinted that he could play mixed doubles in the Olympics with Sania
 sania ko wild card milte hi bhartiya tennis ke ab tak ke shaayad sabase bada vivaad or garma gaya
 Sania's statement seems to further aggravate the already troubled tennis association running on the backfoot
 khaas kar tab jab mahesh bhupati is masale main naa sirf sania ke saath khadey ho gaye hai balki unka bayaan ab liender pes ke camp ko bhadkaa saktaa hai
 Bhupathi says things could have been worse in tennis
 unhone hamen mushkil halaat main daal diya he
 i sympathize with Sania
 team banaate vakt sania se nahin poocha gaya
 i am still ready to play in the Olympics with Sania
 bhupati shaayad sania ko kiye gaye vaade kaa jawaab de rahe hai lekin, isse masalaa sulajhata nahin dikh rahaa he
 It is obvious that the character of Paes, who is looking silent till now, is not the one who keeps listening silently
 aise main agar pes ne munh kholaa to khilaadiyon kaa ahm chaahe jitna santusht ho jaae khel kaa bhala Does not seem to happen
 tennis sangh ke kuch adhikari in dinon landan main wimbledon ke stands main dekhe ja sakate hai lekin, unhone is masale ko ab olympix se pehle ek baar phir media or public main aane diya to unki or faziihat hi hogi
 Apparently, in the war of tennis, Leander is currently seen alone among the players
 to bhupati or bopanna kii jodi behad khush he
 Bopanna is excited about playing in the Olympics for the first time
 unhen bharosa he ki jodi olympics main kamaal kar sakati he
 World number 13 in doubles Rohan Bopanna says we are really happy
 ham utsahit hai ki ham ek saath landan olympix main hissaa le rahe hai
 We worked 6 months hard for London 2012 for this
 tippaniyan This time, eight players in tennis are going to the Olympics, which is the largest tennis team in India so far
 lekin, bharat ko tennis se ab tak 1996 main atlanta olympix main sirf ek padak hasil hua he
 The bronze medal was won by Leander Paes in singles matches
 uske baad sidney athens or beijing main tennis team kai baar padak ke paas pahunch kar bhi chook gai
 This time there is hope, but the big concern of Indian sports lovers is that if this quarrel increases, tennis will lose hope and medal in the Olympics
 mahesh bhupati ne yah bhi ishaara kiya ki vah sania ke saath olympix main mixd dubles khel sakate hai
 Sania got the wild card and perhaps the biggest controversy ever in Indian tennis
 sania ke bayaan se pehle se hi baikfoot par chal rahi tennis sangh kii pareshaani or badhati nazar aa rahi he
 Especially when Mahesh Bhupathi has not only stood with Sania in this issue, but his statement can now provoke the camp of Leander Paes
 bhupati kehete hai tennis main chizein or karaab ho sakati thim
 They have put us in a difficult situation
 mujhe sania ke saath sahanubhuti he
 Sania was not asked while making the team
 main ab bhi sania ke saath olympix main khilne ko taiyaar hum
 Bhupathi may be responding to the promise made to Sania but, it does not seem to solve the issue
 zaahir he ab tak khamosh dikh rahe pes kii fitarat chup hokar sunate rahane vaale khilaadi kii nahin he
 In such a situation, if Paes opens his mouth, then the players will be satisfied as much as they can
 hota nahin dikhataa
 Some officials of the Tennis Association can be seen at the Wimbledon stands in London these days, but they will be more upset if they allow the issue to once again come in the media and public before the Olympics
 zaahir taur par tennis kii jang main liender filhal khilaadiyon ke bich akele dikh rahe hai
 So the pair of Bhupathi and Bopanna are very happy
 bopanna pehali baar olympics main khilne ko lekar behad utsahit hai
 He is confident that the pair can do wonders in the Olympics
 dubles main world number 13 rohan bopanna kehete hai ham vaaki khush hai

 The comments is baar tennis main aath khilaadi olympics main ja rahe hai jo bharat kii ab tak kii sabase badi tennis team he
 However, India has only won one medal from tennis at the Atlanta Olympics in 1996
 ittifaakan wo kaansya padak liender pes ne singles muqaabalon main jeeta tha
 After that, the tennis team in Sydney Athens and Beijing also missed the medal several times

 maharashtra sarkaar kii ore se pesh adhivaktaa nishanth aar katneshvarkar ne bataaya ki yachika par notice jari karne ke dauraan peeth ne unase maukhik rup se kaha ki vah adhikariyon se vahaan nirmaan gatividhiyaan roak dene ko kahen
 The NGO Conservation Action Trust had approached the High Court challenging the order dated 23 February 2015 by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change
 mantralay ne 3600 karod rupee kii laagat se banane vaali pariyojna ko paryaavaran or tateey kshetra niyaman manjuuri di thi
 The NGO had requested a stay on the order and stopped the authorities from taking further steps on the project
 ab rajya peedblyoody ne pariyojna ke thekedaar ko tatkaal prabhaav se kaam rokane ke liye kaha he
 Every human has its own body language ie body language
 insaan chaahe kitna bhi meetha kyon na bole, uskaa vyavhaar kitna bhi acha kyon na ho, agar uski body language main khot he to iskaa saamne vaale par nakaaratmak prabhaav padataa he
 In such a situation, it is necessary that what we are thinking, what we are speaking, must be harmonized with our body language
 body language kaa kaamkaaj or safalataa par bhi gaharaa prabhaav padataa he
 Even if the talent is full inside you, but if there is a flaw in your body language with it, then it can prove to be a big stone in your path of success
 'tallent smart' naam kii ek sanstha ne is ore lakhon safal or asafal logon kaa adhyayan kiya or paaya ki body language se judi 15 aisi galtiyaan hai jo safal insaan kabhi nahin karte
 1) Walking in a carefree or ugly style is considered disrespectful
 yah dikhaata he ki aapkaa saamne vaale kii baton main koi ruchi nahin he or aap uski koi phikr nahin karte
 Whereas any manager at the workplace prefers to keep carefree people away from responsibility
 yani agali baar jab aapkaa bos aapse kuch kah rahaa ho to na sirf unhen sune balki khud ke jimmedaar hone kaa ehsaas bhi karavaaen
 2) Exaggerately talk to someone at the workplace, even if it is your boss
 choti-moti safalataa ke liye chizon yaa baton ko badha chadhaakar pesh na karen
 It tarnishes your image and the front realizes that you just know how to talk
 baatcheet ke kram main kabhi apni baahon ko na failaaen yaa hatheli dikhaakar baat na karen
 3) Watching the clock again and again while talking to someone, look in his eyes and talk
 yah bataata he ki aapke andar aatmavishvaas he
 It is wrong to steal eyes or to look repeatedly at the clock
 yah bataata he ki aap saamne vaale kii baton ko sunne kii bajaay baatcheet ko jald khatm karnaa chaahate hai
 4) Separating yourself from others
 You do a great job, but it is wrong if you do not get involved in people's conversations
 jab kabhi offis ke log aapas main baat kar rahe hote hai to khud ko unase dur rakhane kii bajaay unke group main shaamil hona chahie
 It states that you are also interested in a better relationship with people than with work
 5) cross leg yaa cross armsakai baar dekhne main aata he ki baatcheet ke kram main log cross leg hokar baithna pasand karte hai
 Or talk with folded arms
 body language ke visheshgyon kaa maananaa he aisa nahin karnaa chahie
 Especially when you are talking to your boss
 kyonki iskaa arth yah nikalataa he ki aap khulkar baat nahin karnaa chaahate yaa kuch chupa rahe hai
 6) The gestures you are speaking in the course of the conversation should also appear on your face
 masalan agar aap dukhi hai to yah chehre par dikhnaa chahie
 Should be seen if you are upset
 varanaa saamne vaala aap par katai vishwaas nahin karegaa
 7) We agree to shake our head when we agree with the person who agitates too much, but avoid unnecessarily shaking head over or over everything
 8) baar-baar bal thik karnabaatcheet ke kram main kabhi bhi apane baalo ko yaa kapadon ko baar-baar thik na karen
 It seems that you just take care of yourself and you are not interested in the words or thoughts of others
 9) aankh milanajaisa ki pehle bhi kaha gaya he ki baatcheet ke kram main aankh milakar baat karen
 10) Join the eyes, do not stare; talking with eyes does not mean staring into the eyes of the front
 aam taur par baatcheet ke kram main ek baar main 7-10 second tak aankh milakar baat karen
 Then blink the eyelid
 11) ankhen gol-gol ghumanabahut se log baatcheet ke kram main ankhen gol-gol ghumaate hai
 Avoid doing this
 agar yah aapaki aadat he to ise badalane kaa prayaas karen
 12) Be happy, keep freshness on face, if you work then it is also important to be happy with work
 har vakt cheharaa banaakar rakhana yaa dukhi dikhnaa acchhee baat nahin he
 13) While shaking hands, do not ever shake hands in the form of light hands or carelessness
 isse aisa lagata he jaise aapke andar aatmavishvaas kii kami he
 When you shake hands, with full vigor and freshness
 14) mutthi baandhnabaatcheet ke kram main mutthi baandhna bhi galat sanket detaa he
 This also indicates that you do not want to talk openly like a cross leg or cross arm
 15) adhik nikat na jaaembaatcheet ke kram main jaruri duuri banaakar rakhen
 Do not talk too close

 There is no immediate solution to the problem of air pollution in delhi-ncr
 dilli kii jaharila hawa par siyasat bhi tej ho gai he
 The central government has blamed Delhi for 80 percent of the pollution
 vahiin engiti ne helicopter se pani chhidkaav kaa farmaan sunaaya he
 Delhi government woke up to pollution on eighth day, prohibited any kind of construction and demolition activity for a week
 iske alaava 15 saal puraani dijal gadiyon kaa registration radd karne kaa bhi kaam bhi shuru kar diya gaya he
 Fireworks have also been banned at the wedding

 Such situation has been arising in Beijing, the capital of China, for some years
 yahaan thand ke mausam main har saal smog kii sthiti ban ja rahi he
 The situation is that Beijing has started to be ranked among the most polluted cities in China
 haalanki china kii sarkaar ne pradooshan se bachane ke liye kai kadam uthaae hai
 How did the smoke of Punjab reach Delhi? If the condition of smog in delhi-ncr was created, then the farmers of punjab-haryana and surrounding states were blamed for this
 kaha ja rahaa he ki kisaan kheton main fasal katane ke baad bache dher (paraali) jala rahe hai, is vajah se vaayu pradooshit hui he
 NASA has also recently released some photos showing the fire in the fields of Punjab
 lekin yahaan gaur karne vaali baat yah he ki 16 oktober se hawa kaa rukh pakistan or rajasthan kii ore he
 In such a situation, how can pollution in Delhi be increased due to burning straw in the fields of Punjab
 dilli-ensiaar kii kharaab hui hawa ke liye padosi rajyon ke kheton main lagaai gai aag hi akele jimmedaar nahin he
 Diesel vehicles running on the roads in Delhi, smoke emanating from factories and fierce fireworks on the occasion of Diwali also have a big hand in air pollution
 in 5 tareekon se kam hoga pradooshanpradooshan se hone vaale swasthya sambandhi samasyaon ko dekhte hue dilli-ensiaar main skool tak band kara die gaye hai
 Although this pollution cannot be reduced suddenly but it can be reduced in some ways
 1
 Simulated raincloud seeding is a process in which some chemical is released into the sky with the help of a rocket
 ye chemical aasmaan main jaakar riect karte hai or barish hoti he
 2
 smog hataane vaali mashinanderland ke ek diziner ne pradooshan ko kam karne kii sabase badi mashin taiyaar kii he
 This machine smogs 3 xxrep 4 0 meters of cubic area in 1 hour
 3
 Use the vacuum cleaner to remove the dust cleaner
 You can also help reduce pollution to a great extent
 pichley saal disambar main china main ek vyakti vaikum clinar lekar sadak par niklaa tha or 100 din main usne jo dhul-mitti aadi jamaa kiye the, usase baad main ek eent banaai gai
 4
 pani kaa chhidakavudati dhul par agar pani daal diya jaae to ye aasaani se jameen par baith jaati he or hawa main bhi thandak aa jaati he
 That is why if sprayed around the house daily, it can help reduce the smog to a great extent
 5
 In the covered park, fresh air ventilation architecture and a design firm have designed a park that will be pollution free
 unki website ke anusaar, ye park puri tarah dhanke honge or inamen bane botanical garden se yahaan aane waalon ko ekadam taaja hawa milegi

 unhone up rajyapal ko shukriya bhi kaha he
 He said that we hope it will be successful
 ab geela or sookhaa kooda alag-alag gaadiyaan uthaaengi
 In Madhya Pradesh too, this type of system is similar to the way in which the MCD has started in Delhi
 aisi hi muhim madhya pradesh main pichley do saalon se chal rahi he
 That is, the vehicles of the corporation collect wet and dry waste separately
 shaayad isi kaaran madhya pradesh ke 22 shahar svachh shahar ke 100 shaharon main shaamil hai
 This plan to reduce waste from landfill sites will also help in reducing the waste from landfill sites as the wet and dry waste will be sorted before reaching there and the waste will reach the landfill sites only in very small quantities
 jisase ki paryaavaran ko bhi khaasaa phayda pahonchega

 Most of those users are security experts, journalists and activists
 yani twitor ne yah mana he ki sarkaar kii taraf se jaankaree jutaney ke liye kisi khaas yujar kaa acount torget kiya ja saktaa he

 Discussion is going on in the Lok Sabha regarding the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganization Bill
 isi charchaa ke dauraan samaajawaadee party ke pramukh akhilesh yadav centre sarkaar par jamkar barase or is faisle ko galat bataaya
 At the same time, Akhilesh alleged that force is being used in Kashmir today and the people of Kashmir are not happy with this decision
 akhilesh yadav ne kaha ki aaj maahaul aisa ho gaya he ki mere padosi sadan main hi maujuud nahin hai
 The Home Minister is saying that we have passed this proposal from the Legislative Assembly
 jisapar amit shah ne bich main tokaa or kaha ki raashtrapati ne apni shakti kaa istemaal karte hue rajyapal ko hi vidhansabha kii takat di he
 The SP chief said that two days ago the Governor of Jammu and Kashmir was saying that he did not know anything, but the whole country has seen what you did in the last 48 hours
 aap jashn manaa rahe hai, lekin jis pradesh ke liye faisla liya gaya he vahaan ke logon kaa kya?
 
 
 When Akhilesh narrated the story of 'brinjal', Akhilesh also narrated an anecdote and said that the emperor once said in a feast that the brinjal vegetable is good, his ministers also praised the vegetable
 or badshaah ke saathi birbal ne bhi aisa hi kiya
 But the very next day when the emperor's health deteriorated, he did evil of brinjal vegetable in front of Birbal
 akhilesh ne bataaya ki iske baad birbal ne bhi aisa hi kiya, jab badshaah ne sawaal kiya to birbal ne kah diya ki vah bangan kii naukari nahin karte hai, balki badshaah kii naukari karte hai
 i will say whatever the king says
 ant main akhilesh yadav ne kaha ki jammu-kashmir main rajyapal ne bhi aisa hi kiya he
 The SP chief said that many of the comrades from the Army School from whom i have studied have been martyred while fighting terrorists in the valley, we have also lost my colleague Major Gopinder Singh Rathore
 unhone kaha ki aap log kehete ho ki sattar saal main kuch nahin hua he to kya aap apane 11 saal nahin ginate hai
 Apart from this, Akhilesh Yadav also sought an answer from the government on Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (pok) and asked that the Home Minister give assurance that pok is our part
 grih mantri bataaen ki pok hamaara he
 He said that at the same time, also tell when will happiness like Kashmir be found in nagaland-mizoram-sikkim
 dilli kii ek adaalat ne vivaadit AFSPA ko hataane kii maang ko lekar 12 saal se anshan kar rahi irom sharmila chanu ke khilaaf varsh 2006 main apane ‘aamaran anshan’ ke dauraan kathith rup se khudakushi karne ke prayaas ke maamle main aaj aarope tay kiye
 Metropolitan Magistrate Akash Jain framed charges against 40-year-old Sharmila under Section 309 (attempt to commit suicide) of the Indian Penal Code
 sharmila ne koi aparaadh karne se inkaar karte hue kaha ki yah unka ahimsak pradarshan tha
 The court fixed May 22 for recording the prosecution evidence in the case
 yah maamla 4 aktubar 2006 ko sainya bal visheshadhikaar adhinium (AFSPA) ko hataane kii maang ko lekar yahaan jantar mantar par hue unke aamaran anshan se sambandhit he
 Amidst the protest outside the court premises, Sharmila appeared before the judge and said, 'I don't want to commit suicide
 meraa keval ahimsak pradarshan he
 Living like a human is my demand
 ’ unhone adaalat se kaha, ‘main jindagi se pyaar karti hum
 i do not want to take my life but i want justice and peace
 ’ haalanki magistrate ne unase kaha ki un par khudakushi kaa prayaas karne kaa aarope he or pratham drushtya unke khilaaf aarope dikhataa he
 Asked if you confess your crime, Sharmila said 'no'
 sharmila ko ab sunwaayee kaa saamana karnaa hoga
 The judge said that i respect you but the law of the country does not allow you to end your life
 apane vakil se charchaa karne ke baad bhi sharmila ne kaha ki agar sarkaar AFSPA hataayegi, tab hi main bhojan grahan karuungi
 However, the court said that this is a political process
 yahaan main keval is maamle par kendrit hum
 Sharmila started a fast-unto-death in 2000, after 10 civilians were killed by Assam Rifles personnel in the Malom area near Imphal Airport
 vah philhal nyaayik hiraasat main hai or unhen naak ke raste se bhojan nalee se bhojan diya ja rahaa he
 Sharmila was brought here from Manipur for court proceedings last evening

 (input ieenes se) (input from IANS) Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) kii bhartiya mul kii vaigyanik manisha mohan ne steekar kii tarah dikhne vaala ek sensor viksit kiya he, jo rape jaisi ghatnaon ko rokegaa or aasapaas ke logon or unke doston va parivaar ko alert bhejega
 This sensor can be applied on any fabric like a sticker
 is sensor ko is tarah taiyaar kiya gaya he ki vah jabaran sharir se kapade hataane kii gatividhi ko bhaap jaataa he or uske anusaar kaam karata he
 Manisha of MIT gave this information to PTI
 beti ke liye waterpruf feeding suut banaaya, ab duniyabar se aa rahi he demandpidita agar ladane kii sthiti main nahin he yaa kisi kaaran se wo chal nahin sakati yaa choti bacchee he to aisi sthiti main yah sensor uske parivaar or doston tak alert bhej saktaa he
 The Bluetooth in it is connected to the smartphone app
 vipareet paristhitiyon main yah tej aawaaj kar aasapaas ke logon ko alert bhejtaa he
 This sensor works in two modes
 pasive mod main yah menuali kaam karata he
 That is, when there is a danger, the girl presses the button and alerts the people around it
 batan dabaate hi tej alarm bajane lagegaa yaa doston ko kol bhi lag jaati he
 Example: Anshu Jamsenpa created Mount Everest for the fourth time
 In the active mode, this sensor detects danger through external signals
 udhaaharan ke taur par agar koi peedita ke sharir se kapade utaarne kii koshish kar rahaa he to yah sensor uske smartphone par ek sandesh bhejtaa he, jisase sensor yah sunishchat karegaa ki ladki chetana avasthaa main he yaa nahin
 If the message is not sent within 30 seconds, the phone starts making a loud sound to alert the people around
 agar ladki is alarm ko 20 second ke andar band nahin karti he, to ap yah maan letaa he ki ladki musiibat main he or vah uske parivaar or doston ke paas distress signal bhejnaa shuru kar detaa he, jisamen peedita kahaan he, uskaa pataa bhi hota he
 Mohan said that he got the idea only after the experience he had while studying engineering in Chennai

 apane mithkeey tantra main hindu duniya main kuch alag-se hai
 In contrast, Hindutva is very close to the dominant ideas in the world at the present time
 iskaa ehsaas do mithkon—samanta or aahat bhaavana—par gaur karne se hota he
 The myth of equality is diversity in nature
 isamen is myne main samanta bhi he ki prakruti kisi bhi praani ko khaas nahin samajhati
 Every living being has to protect its existence through its capabilities and strengths and overcome its weaknesses and find opportunities while battling the dangers
 samanta kaa saanskrithik vichaar bahut alag he
 This is the myth that shaped the beliefs associated with Abraham
 abrahami manyata kaa ishwar apane sabhi anuyaayiyon ko samaan rup se pyaar karata he
 He is extremely jealous and does not tolerate other gods
 ishwar kii najar main koi ooncha yaa nicha nahin he
 Every attempt to highlight any differences in his world, ie irresistibility, is seen as arrogance or cowardice
 yahi vajah he ki abrahami manyataayen ekarupata laane kii koshish main rahati hai
 They are intolerant of any deviation
 ve ek hi sach ko talashne kaa prayaas karti rahati hai
 Hinduism is quite different from this
 vah vividhta ko mahatv detaa he
 Every community is considered unique here
 harek ke apane devi-devtaa, apni manyataayen or reeti-rivaaj hai
 Like trees and animals in the forest, there is tension within communities as they vie for resources
 natijatan, ek anishchit kism kaa padanukram ban jaataa he
 As such, some communities and as a result some Gods also become more important than the rest
 lekin aisa hameshaa ke liye nahin rahata
 Some one is always at the center and one is always marginalized
 lekin yah sachal prakriya he
 Diversity gives rise to hierarchy, but when it becomes rooted, inequality gets institutionalized
 lihaaja, hakeekat yah he ki hindu dharm vividh samudaayon se bharaapura he jahaan hajaaron jatiyaan satta ke liye ladati hai
 Everyone tries to make their place in the doctrinal Vedic Chaturvarna system
 yahaan samanta aatma ke siddhant se aati he jo kisi deh kaa dehi hoti he
 This body is established in a diverse society
 vaishvik gaanv kaa maujuuda maanavtaavaadi siddhant maanavadhikaron ke siddhant ke saath-saath abrahami manyataon se upja he
 All that has happened in this is that the state has taken the place of God and patriotism has taken the place of recognition
 acha samvidhan aise niyamon kaa punj he jinamein sabhi naagarik samaan hote hai or unke adhikaar baraabar hote hai or sansadhano tak baraabar pahunch muhaiyaa karaane kii baat hoti he
 This principle of equal rights does not recognize diversity
 maujuuda vaishvik sankat isi vajah se he
 After all, how can a state that gives equal rights to all its citizens place religions whose God does not allow them to treat women as equal to men or in whose culture homosexuals are not equal or who allow their women outside the tribe Does not allow marriage or does not allow men to change their beliefs or which castes consider other castes as untouchables? It was woven around the principle of equality
 bharat kaa vividhta se vaasta lambey samay se rahaa he lekin viksit deshon ko ab jaakar iskaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he jab unke deshon main badi sankchaya main pravasi aa rahe hai, arthvyavastha dhimi pad rahi he or samaan adhikaron or saamaajik nyaay ke siddhanton ke anuroop palane vaali ekarupata main asahaj sthitiyaan dikhaai dene lagi hai
 So, it is only natural that nation-states with "bharat ideology" and Abrahamic beliefs will have a relationship of opposition to Hinduism, which remains comfortable in its caste, diversity and high-altitude
 pidaa kaa mythkashuru main duniya durust thi
 After that, there was anguish in him
 phir upachaar aayaa
 This is the main myth of Abrahamic beliefs

 The myth of suffering and its consequent salvation determines modern global thinking today

 Ali's death is the anguish of Shia Islam

 Caste is the suffering of Dalits

 Poverty is the suffering of communism and capitalism

 ve smritilop ko sabase badi traasadee ke rup main dekhte hai
 Hindutva is all about suffering and hurt feelings
 vah hinduon kaa apmaan or hindu sabhyataa kii paraajay ko ''kabhi nahin bhuulegaa" jo aakrantaon ke haathon hajaar saal kii ''gulaami" se mili he, pehle musalamaanon, phir isai mishnariyon or ant main angrejon se
 India's intellectual elite or modern experts will dismiss this as Fascism
 lekin yah to sari ''pidaaon" ke hi sandarbh main he
 Every politician knows that an obsessive, strategic and manipulative attachment of culture to a particular event leads to a movement in society, keeping logic out of reason
 haalanki pidaa or aahat bhaavana ke ye myth hindu dharm ke bilkul vipareet hai jahaan shiv ko smarantka yani smritiyon kaa vinaash karne vaale kaa hi naam diya gaya he
 One who desires liberation from the cycle of birth and death, who wishes for good-hearted bliss, who desires peace, must learn how to "let go"
 hindutv akeshwarwadi he kyonki vah ek hi aradhy bharat mata ko maanata he
 They are a symbol of the nation-state
 lekin jahaan ham uske bacchon yani is desh ke logon se waakif hai, yah nahin jaanate ki pati koun hai
 It is a bit strange that because all the Goddesses of Hinduism like Saraswati, Lakshmi and Durga have had a close and turbulent relationship with their husbands Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva
 hindutv ke postaron main krishna ko radha ke bina, ram ko sita ke bina or shiv ko parvati ke bina dikhaaya jaataa he
 His debates praise Shankaracharya's celibacy, which he claims to have prepared a batch of fighting Nagas a thousand years ago to protect humble monks from foreign invaders
 yahi vah daawa he jisase hindutv gundon yaa ''haashiye ke samoohon" ke astitv ko vaazib tehraata he
 However, they will ignore the legend when the same Shankaracharya used his occult powers on the advice of Mandan Mishra's wife, Ubhaya Bharti, to enter into the body of King Amaru and have a sexual experience
 hindutv kaa strain bhav or kaamuktha ko khaarij karnaa un abrahami mithkon ko hi pratidhwanit karata he jinamein ishwar spasht rup se purush he, uske doot bhi purush hai or jahaan uskaa putr bina kisi yon sambandh ke kisi kunari mahila se paidaa hota he
 Like in Abrahamic beliefs, loyalty in Hinduism is merely in compliance, discipline and dedication to an institution (sangh, VHP, BJP) and has nothing to do with love, adornment, melody with transcendental beings to attain the divine
 Which have actually been the hallmarks of Hindu devotion
 jab hindutvvaadi velentine de, mahila shakti or viraasat ko lekar hallaa machaate hai or hindu dharm kii kaam samskruti ko sire se khaarij kar dete hai to usase yah samaj main aata he ki ye rakshak usee ko nasht karne ja rahe hai jise ve bachaana chaahate hai

 In fact, the Lokpal needs at least a two-thirds majority to grant constitutional status which seems difficult for the government as the BJP and the Left are unhappy to keep the CBI out of the Lokpal's purview and if the government needs the opposition, it should Negotiating the bill will have to be reformed, so the government has decided to keep the Lokpal legal now as it will be passed by a simple majority in Parliament

 Due to allegations of rape by a minor, the troubles of Asaram, which came under the grip of law, do not seem to end
 jahaan police ke majboot cese ke chalate asaram ko abhi tak jamaanat nahin mili he
 At the same time, the suspicion is turning towards Asaram and his family behind the murder of witnesses one after the other in this case

 ipies afasar amitabh thakur ne bataaya ki unhen mritak ke pita naresh ne phone par bataaya ki unke ladke kaa cese kisi ranjish kaa parinaam nahin he
 The murder is directly related to the dismissal of Asaram's bail plea by the Gujarat High Court on 5 January 2015

 dilli ke kohat enklev ilaake main ek building main lagi aag ke chalate ek hi parivaar ke sabhi chaar sadasyon kii maut ho gai
 The deceased include a husband and wife and two innocent children
 parivaar building kii first floor par rahata tha
 Delhi Police said that the fire service men recovered the bodies of all four from near the stairs
 police ke mutabik, chaaron kii maut dam ghutane ke chalate hui
 Police have identified the dead as Rakesh, the head of the house, his wife Tina, 7-year-old Divyanshu and 3-year-old Shreya
 rakesh nagpal kaa chandani chowk main kapade kaa bijness tha or yahaan par building number 484 main apana flats kharid kar parivaar ke saath rah rahe the
 Neighbors allege that this incident would not have taken such a terrible form if the Delhi Fire Service team had come on time
 padosiyon ne bataaya ki aag itani bheeshan thi ki dekhte dekhte puri building ko apni chapet main le liya
 The fire started with an electric meter on the ground floor of the building
 building ke guard ne dhuna dekhakar building kaa alert baja diya tha
 Hearing the sound of the alert, the people of the entire building came down, but the Nagpal family could not come down
 dilli fire sarvisaki team ne nagpal parivaar ke chaaro sadasyon kii laashen sidhiyon ke paas se baraamad kin
 5 vehicles parked in the parking lot of the building also caught fire
 saath hi kareeb 10 bike bhi jalakar puri tarah khaak ho gai
 Currently the corpses have been sent for postmortem
 yah adhyadesh puri tarah bakawaas he
 It should be torn and thrown away !! ”rahul Gandhi's sudden appearance at the press conference of Press Club of Delhi on September 2013 was not only new but also amazing
 sansad main chuppi, party forum par sannata, or sakriyata tathaa niskriyata ke bich hameshaa asamanjas banaakar rakhane vaale rahul, apni sarkaar ke ek adhyadesh ko is andaaj main kachare kaa dibba dikhaaenge, iskaa anumaan kisi ko nahin tha
 The appearance of the Congress was worth seeing
 yahaan yah yaad dilaanaa jaruri he ki yah adhyadesh supreme court ke aadesh par amal rokane ke makasad se bana tha
 On July 10, 2013, the Supreme Court ruled that Section 8 of the Representation of the People Act was invalid and ruled that if an MP or MLA was declared an accused by the court, his membership would be terminated immediately
 puri siyasat bachaav main aage aa gai
 To stop the execution of the court order, the then UPA government coined an ordinance and quoted an all-party meeting claiming that all parties agreed to it
 rajnatik sahmatiyaan pratyaksh rup se dikh bhi raheen thim
 However, Rahul went away from the perspective of the government and the party, not only that the Congress and the BJP were doing politics on this but also his comment that "we have to stop this idiocy
" bhrashtachar se ladanaa he to chote-chote samjhaute nahin chalenge
 "needless to say, the ordinance went into the dustbin after Rahul Gandhi's protest
 is prasang kaa zikr yahaan rahul gandhi ke rajnatik saahas yaa sujh kii yaad dilaane ke liye nahin ho rahaa he
 The matter is actually the opposite
 rahul gandhi bhartiya raajnneeti main apane liye ek nai shrenee garh rahe hai
 The people of India have seen courageous and long fighting leaders
 bikharakar phir khadi hone vaali congress dekhi he
 The struggling BJP has seen an absolute majority from two seats
 baar-baar banane vaala teesraa morcha dekha he
 After losing everything, we have seen the Aam Aadmi Party securing the power of Delhi, but Rahul Gandhi is a unique leader who has mastered the opportunity to miss
 rahul rahasyamay agyatavaas se lautakar agle saptaah jab congress kii siyasat main sakriy honge to jokhim unke liye nahin balki party ke liye he, kyonki uske is pariwari netaa ke liye sahi vakt par sahi kadam kaa rajnatik mantra, hameshaa se rocket vigyaan kii tarah abujh rahaa he
 If the Congress tries to understand why the incident that handed over the ordinance to the garbage can in 2013 became a short-sighted presentation of Rahul, it would probably help him escape from this prince
 apradhi netaaon ko bachaane vaala adhyadesh us vakt kii ghatana he jab desh main bhrashtachar ko lekar jan or nyaayik sakriyata apane charam par thi
 At the same time, the court tightened the entry of criminals into politics, which all parties united to stop
 paaramparik siyasat kii jamaat se rahul gandhi li todakar aage aae
 The ruling party's most powerful leader's opposition to the government was unexpected, but even more astonishing was that Rahul again got lost in the background, while from here a new path of his politics could open
 is baat se ittefaq karnaa padegaa ki rahul gandhi rajnatik samaj rakhte hai lekin iske saath yah bhi sach he ki siyasat or samay ke najuk rishte kii unhen katai samaj nahin he
 The mass movement against corruption that ultimately led to the embarrassing defeat of the Congress and the unprecedented victory of the BJP could actually become an opportunity for Rahul Gandhi
 lokapal banane kii javabdehi centre sarkaar kii thi
 All political parties were almost marginalized and a mass movement was talking directly to the government
 is maukey par agar rahul gandhi ne thik vaise hi turshi dikhaai hoti jaisi 2013 ke sitambar main apradhi netaaon ke bachaav main aa rahe adhyadesh ke khilaaf thi to desh kii rajnatik tasviir yakeenan kaaphi alag hoti
 This is an example of Rahul's expertise in missing the opportunity when the Congress prince got engrossed in a ritual when the opportunity to encircle the Modi government over the new Land Acquisition Act he had pressurized his government
 britain ke mahaan pradhanmantriyon main ek (1868 se 1894 tak chaar baar pradhanmantri) wiliam evart gladstone ko raajnneeti main philosphy of rhite timming kaa praneta mana jaataa he
 Gladstone, the famous Liberal leader and wonderful speaker, was a competitor to the Conservative leader Benjamin Disraeli
 duniya bhar ke netaaon ne unase yahi siikhaa he ki sahi maukey par sateek siyasat safal banaati he
 Gladstone's philosophy can be seen in all political successes, from Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Sonia Gandhi, David Cameron, Barack Obama to Narendra Modi
 alabatta rahul gandhi ke rajnatik cockhare kii kitaab se vah paath hi hataa diya gaya tha, jo sahi maukey par sateek siyasat sikhaata he
 After becoming the Congress General Secretary for the first time, Rahul had said at the Talkatora Stadium in Delhi that success depends on chance, success has been the ones who have got the opportunity
 alabatta rahul kii raajnneeti mauka milane ke baad bhi asafal hone kaa tarika sikhaati he
 The Congress should be afraid of Rahul because this prince is his master of missed opportunities and during the "rahul period" the Congress has lost all opportunities to improve, change and move forward
 phir bhi agyatavaas se laute rahul ko congress sir ankhon par hi bithaaegi kyonki yah party parivaarwaad ke abhishaap ko apana param saubhaahgya maanati he
 However, someone in the party must ask Rahul Gandhi whether during Vipassana in Myanmar someone had told him that Gautam Buddha's sutra said, "your biggest problem is to think that you have enough time
" '' congress or rahul ke paas ab sachmuch bilkul samay nahin he

 dharmantaran kii yah sankhya dikhaati he ki america main 11 sitambar or landan main 7 july ko hue hamalon kaa dharmantaran par koi vipareet prabhaav nahin padaa he
 The survey used 2001 Scottish census data, according to Britain's leading newspaper The Independent
 surveykshan main shaamil logon se yah poocha gaya ki janm ke samay unka dharm kya tha or ab unka dharm kya he
 In addition, the researchers inspected the mosques in London to find out how many cases of conversion took place within a year
 masjidon main pichley ek saal ke bheetar dharmantaran kii sankhya 1400 ke aasapaas thi
 Based on this, the number of conversions that took place in the entire country was removed, which was around 5200

 # Dhoom3 This July when Sushma Bhadu stopped veil on her face, she did not even realize that she was laying the foundation of a revolution
 june, 2010 main vedhani miyaan khan gaanvaki sarpanch chuni gayi
 In Haryana it is traditionally necessary for any daughter-in-law to wear a veil
 ghunghat hataane ke ek saptaah baad 22 july, 2012 ko aasapaas ke 25 gaanvon kii anganbari kaaryakartaaon, panchayat kii mahila sadasyon or chaatraon kii ek sabha main sushamaa ne us ‘naarkeey’ ghunghat ko utaar phenkane kii saarvajanik ghoshnaa karte hue kaha, ‘‘ghunghat mere kisi kaam kaa nahin
 It does not make me move forward and becomes an obstacle in the way of doing things related to family or village
 or sabase ahm baat ki yah ek insaan ke taur par meri pahchaan banane nahin detaa he
 “despite being less educated, intelligence was shifting from his words
 unhone saatvin kaksha ke baad padhai chhod di thi
 As if that young sarpanch had touched the sore side of the women present there
 sushamaa ke 35 varshiya pati bhagwaan das ne us din ke manjar ko yaad karte hue bataaya, ‘‘yah ek ufaan kii tarah tha
 "hundreds of younger and older women have stood up and expressed their support and vowed to remove the veil, that they will no longer allow that piece of cloth to be restored to their" backwardness
 das ko tab sukun mahasoos hua jab unhen laga ki unki patni akeli nahin he or koi bhi unka makhul nahin uda saktaa he
 From this village, the sound of change is spreading in every corner
 ghunghat mukt chehre se aatmavishvaas chhalakaati 30 saal kii kamalesh rani apana nayaa self-start scooter rokkar puuchhati hai ki hamen kahaan janaa he? jab ham unase ghunghat kaa tyaag karne vaali mahilaon ke bare main poochhate hai to us anganbari kaaryakarta kaa cheharaa khil uthta he, jo dhani miyaan khan or do paraspar sate gaanvon, chapalamori or salamkhera ke liye kaam kar rahi hai
 "it's not easy," she says
 ’’unhone bataaya ki padosi gaanvon ke mard dhaani miyaan khan kii mahilaon kaa majaak udaate hai
 He says sarcastically, "now you have got an exemption, you can do anything
" ’’ aksar ‘kuch bhi’ ke saath unka ishaara aisi baton kii ore hota he, jise likhaa nahin ja saktaa
 She smiles, "but we are not going to give up
" shor-sharaaba or fikrebaaji to mardon kii aadat he
 "everywhere in the village, there is a touch of the hands of the hands of women
" galiyon main cement kii inten bichhi hai, bijli ke khambhon par lage balb roshni dete hai or har ghar main bijli or pani kii uchit vyavastha he
 Drains are open, but clean
 salike se saje ghar kii tarah dikhne vaale dhani miyaan khan ko swatchta ke liye 2012 kaa nirmal gram puraskaar diya gaya he
 Even before the veil was removed, the sarpanch Bhadu had established her identity as a combative woman
 mahilaon ke liye ek silaai prashikshan centre kholane ke liye 10 lakh ru
 She continued to try to get a grant of Rs
1000 and finally got Punjab National Bank ready to sponsor the training program
 ve garv bhare swar main kahati hai, ‘‘hamen (ve kabhi ‘main’ kahkar baat nahin karatin) apane gharon kii jal aapurti ko or behatar karne kii disha main water-boosting system taiyaar karne ke liye rajya sarkaar se nidhi mili he
 "she did not get a chance to complete education, but today she prefers that every child in her village go to school
" jabase ve sarpanch bani hai, rajkeey praathmik vidhyalay, jise 2013 tak madhyamik vidhyalay bana diya jayega, main ek bhi bachche ne skool nahin choda he
 37-year-old Manindra Singh and his colleague Chhotu Ram, 40, are both teachers at the school
 ghunghat ko saamanti pravriti kaa parichaayak maanane vaale singh kehete hai, ‘‘yah aitihaasik he
 When it spreads across Haryana, everyone will say that it started from here
 ’’dhani miyaan khan panchayat kii ek or sadasya 35 varshiya birma devi kaa kahana he ki ghunghat hat jane se paradaa pratha ke saaye main ghut rahi ladakiyon or yuvatiyon ko kuch sakaaratmak kaam karne kii aazaadee milegi
 Renuka Dagar, 44, head of the Gender Studies Unit of Chandigarh's Institute for Development and Communication, says that Dhani Mian Khan's women have "disagreed" in a society where women's lives are insecure
 ’’ ve kahati hai ki kukhyat khap panchayatein pratishtha ke naam par maut kaa farmaan suna detii hai
 The 'life situation' of the women here is the worst in the world
 dagar kaa maananaa he ki ghunghat kaa virodh karne vaali bhadu ne darasal rajya sarkaar ko chunauti di he ki vah aage aae or mahilaon ko zyada suraksha pradaan kare
 It is surprising that even after two months, words of appreciation did not come out of the tongue of the state government for that unmatched step taken in Dhani Mian Khan village
 jabaki mahapanchayat ne bhi kanya bhrunahatya band karne kaa elaan kar diya; shishu ke sex kii jaanch karwaane vaale logon ko beparda karne ke liye puraskaar kii ghoshnaa bhi kar di or oonchi shiksha praapt karne kii icchhuk garib ladakiyon ko chaatravrutti de rahi he
 The 66-year-old noted social activist Krishna Swaroop considers this move by Sushma Bhadu as a firm step towards sustainable results
 ’’ ve kehete hai ki shahari mahilaon, jo aksar adheenta se samjhauta kar leti hai, ke vipareet ‘‘hariyaanvi samaaj main sirf ghunghat hataa dene bhar se 50 fisadi kaam ho gaya samajhe
 But to win this fight, the contribution of progressive voluntary groups and government is necessary
 ’’philhal 426 mahilaon or 416 purushon vaale is chote-se gaanv main suraj kii khili roshni chai he
 The future also looks golden
 kamalesh rani ko 6 saal tak ke aayu varg ke bacchon kii sankhya ginaney main behad khushi mahasoos ho rahi he, ‘‘hamaare paas 51 ladkiyaan or 44 ladke hai
 "hopefully, the Khap Panchayat has begun to say goodbye

 com / gi6bfdjm16 aise samay jab bijepi ne hindu mahilaon ko 'chaar bachche' paidaa karne kii salaah dene vaale party saansad sakshi maharaj ko kaaran bataao notice jari kiya he, unki hi party ke ek anya netaa ne isse ek kadam or aage badhate dikhe
 BJP leader Shyamlal Goswami of Birbhum in West Bengal says that Hindu women should have five children
 veerbhum main bijepi ke jila upaadhyaksh goswami ne somvaar ko ek jansabha main kaha, 'main apni hindu maataaon or bahanon se kahana chahta hum ki agar ve paanch bachche nahin paidaa karengi, to bhavishya main bharat main asantulan ho jayega
 Don't get me wrong agar meri hindu maa or bahanon ko paanch bachche naa hon, to bharat main shaayad hi koi hindu bachegaa
 To save Hindutva and Sanatana Dharma, all Hindus must have five children
 ' Earlier, BJP leader Sakshi Maharaj had made a similar controversial statement, after which the party issued a show cause notice on Monday, asking them to reply within 10 days
 unnav se bijepi ke saansad sakshi maharaj ne pichley hafte meerut main sant samagam ko sambodhit karte hue kaha tha, 'chaar biviyon or 40 bacchon kaa concept bharat main nahin chalegaa
 Now the time has come that Hindu women must produce at least four children to save Hinduism
 ' What did the father do to evict his son, who is working in his CRPF, from the property, the son was bloodied
 vah pita se badla lene ke liye ghar aayaa or apane mata-pita kii goli markar hatya kar di
 The father died on the spot, while the mother's condition remains critical
 mritak kaa naam nahar singh (55) tha
 Nahar Singh lived with his second wife Suman in the Baba Haridas Nagar area of delhi
 kareeb 15 saal pehle upi kii rahane vaali suman nahar singh ke sampark main ai thi
 Suman had been living here with her 3 children since her husband's death
 isi vajah se nahar singh or unke beton ke bich vivaad hone laga tha
 Gradually the dispute over the property deepened and one day it came that Nahar Singh, at Suman's behest, evicted his two boys Digambar and Rahul from his property
 iske baad jhagada or zyada bad gaya
 a bloody war started between father and sons
 do din pehle digambar ne apane pita or sauteli maa suman ko goli maar di
 The father died on the spot, while Suman is undergoing treatment
 bataate chalem ki digambarasiarpief main naukrikarta tha
 When he learns that his father is living with another woman, he returns to quit to convince them
 philhal property vivaad main pita kii hatya kii khabar se ilaake main sannata pasra hua he
 Everyone is silent
 police maamle se jude tamaam pahaluon ko khangaal rahi he
 From the beginning of pregnancy, many types of changes in the body of women begin
 ye parivartan na keval shaareerik hote hai balki garbhvatee ko kai maansik badlaavon se bhi guzarana padataa he
 Usually women take care of themselves till pregnancy but after delivery they become a little careless about themselves
 unki laaparvaahee kaa sabase adhik asar unke vajan par dikhaai padataa he
 However, there are many reasons why women gain weight after delivery
 1
 During pregnancy, the amount of food and drink of women increases significantly
 unhen apane saath-saath bachche ke poshan kaa bhi khyaal rakhana hota he
 Due to which their calorie intake increases
 vajan badhane kii ye sabase praathmik vajah hoti he
 2
 ye wo samay hota he jabamahilaayein sabase zyada poshak aahaar leti hai
 Which makes them healthy
 par healdi khaane ke saath hi wo bharpoor neend bhi leti hai or shaareerik kriyaayein kam karti hai
 In this case, weight gain is bound to happen
 3
 a pregnant woman goes through a variety of changes and there is no denying that she does not feel stressed
 kai shodhon main ye sabit ho chukaa he ki tanaav se vajan badhata he
 In such a situation, taking stress and being immersed in thinking all the time is also a major reason for pregnant women to gain weight
 4
 Hypothyroid also causes obesity in pregnant women
 saath hi is dauraan unhen kai tarah kii dawaaiyon kaa seven karnaa padataa he jiske chalate bhi unka sharir prabhavit hota he

 The OBC (other Backward Castes) Reservation Amendment Bill was passed in the Rajasthan Legislative Assembly on Thursday
 is bill main obisi aarakshan 21 fisadi se badhaakar 26 fisadi kiya gaya he
 This arrangement has been made to give five percent reservation to Gurjars
 buudhvaar ko hi pichhadaa varg naukariyon or shaikshanik sansthaaon main aarakshan vidheyak, 2017 vidhansabha main pesh kiya gaya tha
 Which was debated and passed on Thursday
 darasal, gurjaron ke 5 fisadi aarakshan ke liye lambey vakt se rajasthan main khinchataan chal rahi he
 For this arrangement, on Wednesday, for the fourth time, the amendment bill related to reservation was introduced in the House
 rajasthan HC ne diya tha avmaananaa kaa noticerajasthan vidhansabha main buudhvaar ko jab ye bill pesh kiya gaya to hai court ne sarkaar ko fatkaar lagaai
 The court also sent a contempt notice in this regard to the Chief Secretary
 court ne sarkaar ko bataaya ki pehle wo pradesh main obisi kaa quantiphoid data pesh kare, uske baad aage kii kaarywahi kare
 However, the government passed the bill disregarding the contempt order of the court
 court ne ye bhi tippanee kii thi ki 1993 ke baad ab tak sarkaar ne obisi kaa quantiphoid data pesh nahin kiya he
 Rather, without presenting these quantified data, the government included the Jats of Dholpur and Bharatpur in the OBC
 court ne kaha tha ki sarkaar abobisi aarakshanko 21 pratishat se badhaakar 26 pratishat karne ja rahi he
 In such a situation, the government is doing its own arbitrary without creating quantified data of reserved castes in the state
 court ne ise apane purvavarti yani 10 agast 2015 ke aadesh kii avmaananaa mana he
 Explain that by giving 5 percent reservation to Gujjars, the total quota limit is more than 50 percent
 yahi vajah he ki court pehle bhi sarkaar kii koshishon ko jhatka de chukaa he
 However, the government has given a new argument for the reservation limit being exceeded by 50 per cent
 sarkaar kaa kahana he ki vah notification se aarakshan kii vyavastha kar rahi he
 The government also says that in the year 1994, the number of castes was 54, but now there are 91 castes, so there is a need to provide reservation in the proportion in which the castes and population have increased
 sarkaar kaa kahana he ki saal 1931 kii jansankhya ke aadhaar par rajasthan main kul 49 fisadi aarakshan he jise ab badhaane kii zarurat he
 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has attacked the BJP and said, "if there is a Jungle Raj in Bihar, is the brutal beating of Kanhaiya in Delhi's Patiala House Court by lawyers in front of the policemen in Mangalore Raj's address
 ' unhone kaha ki kanhaiya kaa video sharmnaak he
 Nitish Kumar has openly challenged the BJP to tell the police if they are aware of the rape accused Rajballabh Yadav
 mukhyamantri shanivaar ko bihar vidhansabha main rajyapal ke abhibhaashan par jawaab de rahe the
 He said that there is a rule of law in Bihar and there will remain a rule of law
 bijepi ke netaaon khaskar vidhaan mandal dal ke netaa susheel modi dwaara ye aarope ki vidhayak rajballabh yadav sarkaar ke sangrakshan ke kaaran khuleam gum rahe hai, par palatwaar karte hue nitish ne kaha ki agar vipaksh ke netaa ko maaloom he to police ko bataaen
 If there is a problem in that too, then you can also tell about the whereabouts of the MLA secretly
 rajya kii vidhi vyavastha kii charchaa karte hue nitish kumaar ne daawa kiya ki rajya kii vidhi vyavastha niyantran main he or bijepi kaa jangalraj kaa aarope ek stant he
 In his reply, Nitish Kumar discussed in detail the steps taken to improve the police department in recent times and said that in the next three months, a police control room will start functioning in which any person can complain for 24 hours and the police Will take action on those complaints immediately
 nitish ne mana ki rajya main police ke bodyguard kaa durupyog kiya jaataa he or ab iske liye rajya str par ek samiti tay karegi ki aakhir kis vyakti ko kitni suraksha kii jarurat he
 But he did not tell how long it will be done
 nitish kumaar ne apane bhaashan main centre par aarope lagaaya ki jab se vartmaan modi sarkaar ai he, centre pryojit yojana kii raashi main katautee kii gai
 This increased the load on the state
 saath hi unhone bihar bijepi ke netaaon ko chunauti di ki agar himmat he to rajya kaa paisa centre se dilava den
 The comments bihar se kendriya mantri ke is aarope ki rajya sarkaar pariyojna ke liye jameen nahin de rahi he, par nitish kumaar ne kaha ki centre ek nai niti bana le ki jameen kaa paisa wo de or baaki raashi rajya sarkaar de degi
 Referring to the package announced for Bihar by the Prime Minister before the assembly elections, Nitish said that an all-party committee should be set up for how much this package is being implemented
 lekin nitish ne mana ki unhen centre kii madad kii jarurat he
 However, BJP members were not present during Nitish's reply as they boycotted the House on Saturday for calling a meeting of the House
 nitish kumaar ne bijepi ko khuli chunauti di he ki agar unhen balaatkaar ke aaropee rajballabh yadav ke bare main jaankaree he to police ko bataaen
 The Chief Minister was replying to the Governor's address to the Bihar Assembly on Saturday
 unhone kaha ki bihar main kanoon kaa raaj he or kanoon kaa raaj hi rahegaa
 Reacting to allegations by BJP leaders, especially Legislature Party leader Sushil Modi, that mlas are wandering openly due to the patronage of the Rajaballabh Yadav government, Nitish said that if the leader of the opposition knows, then tell the police
 agar usamen bhi dikkat he to gupt rup se bhi vidhayak ke thor-thikaane ke bare main bataa sakate hai
 Referring to the state's law and order, Nitish Kumar claimed that the state's law and order is under control and bjp's allegation of Jungle Raj is a stunt
 nitish kumaar ne apane jawaab main vistaar se haal ke dinon main police vibhaag main sudhaar ke liye uthaaye gaye kadamon kii charchaa kii or kaha ki agle teen maheene main ek police control room kaary karne lagegaa jisame 24 ghante koi bhi vyakti shikaayat kar saktaa he or police tatkaal un shikayaton par karrwai karegi
 Nitish admitted that the police bodyguards are misused in the state and now a committee at the state level will decide which person needs to be protected
 lekin unhone ye nahin bataaya ki aakhir ye kab tak ho paaegaa
 Nitish Kumar in his speech accused the Center that since the present Modi government came, the amount of the centrally sponsored scheme was cut
 rajya ke upar iske kaaran bhaar badha
 At the same time, he challenged the leaders of Bihar BJP to get the state's money from the Center if they have the courage
 tippaniyan On the allegation of the Union Minister from Bihar that the state government is not giving land for the project, Nitish Kumar said that the Center should formulate a new policy that the state government will give the money and the rest will be given by the state government
 vidhansabha chunaav ke pehle pradhanmantri dwaara bihar ke liye ghoshit package kii charchaa karte hue nitish ne kaha ki is package ke upar kitna amal ho rahaa he iske liye ek sarvadaleey cameti kaa gathan kiya janaa chahie
 But Nitish admitted that he needed the help of the Center
 haalanki nitish ke jawaab ke dauraan bijepi ke sadsy maujuud nahin the kyonki unhone shanivaar ko sadan kii baithak bulaae jane ke kaaran sadan kaa bahishkaar kiya tha

 aam aadmi party main chal rahi khinchataan ko party ke ek varisht netaa ne do vichaardhaaraon kii ladaai bataaya he
 In a conversation with NDTV, a senior party leader admitted that the conflict in the party was going on with two different ideologies
 unki nazar main gatirodh is baat par he ki party ke liye siddhant zyaada zaruri hai yaa phir chunaavon main jeet
 Some senior party leaders believe that the identity of any party is formed by principles and not by winning or losing elections
 unki nazar main party ko apane siddhanton ko peeche karke aage nahin badhanaa chahie
 He told NDTV that now the party must decide whether it is more important for him to win the election or the principles of the party
 AAP ke varisht netaaon ke rukh se saaf he ki aam aadmi party main andruni ghamaasan jari he or march ke aakhir main neshnal council kii baithak se pehle phir se party ke kaam karne ke taur-tareeke, uski bhavishya ki disha tay karne se lekar vichaardhaara tay karne tak par gatirodh phir tej ho rahaa he
 Earlier, Mayank Gandhi had raised the question of lack of transparency in the party through a blog
 haalanki wo ye daawa bhi kar rahe hai ki unki manshaa party sanghathan ko kamjor karne kii nahin use or paardarshee or majboot banane kii he
 On the other hand, the party's leader Ashutosh has said that the recent controversy has affected the image of the party and now the National Council of the party will decide what strategy the party will take
 saaf he ki yogendra yadav or prashanth bhushan ko political afares cameti se baahar kiye jane ke dauraan jo sawaal uthe the, wo thamane kaa naam nahin le rahe
 Even today the party has to deal with the same questions
 desh kii badi i-commers company flipcart or vishwa ke sabase badi retail company walmart ke bich chal rahi deal kii khabaron se chote va majhole vyapaariyon ke bich main bhay vyaapt hota ja rahaa he
 The Chamber of Trade and Industry (CTI) says FDI in retail has not yet been fully approved
 yahi kaaran he ki walmart i-commers ke madhyam se bharat main pair pasaarne ke liye chor rasta bana rahaa he
 CTI conveners Brijesh Goyal and Hemant Gupta say that the matter is related to small and medium traders of the country, so we will oppose it in every way
 walmart or flipcart ke bich jo qaraar hone ja rahaa he, vah na keval chote va majhole vyapaariyon ke liye to chintaa kaa vishay he hi, balki sarkaar ke liye bhi chintaa kaa vishay he
 The Walmart company has a history that it has completely destroyed the local retailers in the country it has visited, as well as the economy of that country
 tippaniyan CTI Senior Vice President Pradeep Gupta and General Secretary Ramesh Ahuja said that India's retail market is around Rs 40 lakh crore
 yahi kaaran he ki varshon se walmart kii najar bharat par lagi hui he
 But the Indian government should think that if a company like Walmart is allowed to enter the country, what will happen to the small and medium traders here? Small and medium traders also contribute a lot in our country's economy
 desh kii badi aabaadi isse judi he or apni roji roti chalaati he
 Another important aspect is that Walmart manufactures most of the goods from China
 walmart ke desh main aane se chini utpaadon ko phir badhaava milegaa
 He said that CTI is in opposition to Walmart and in the coming days it will oppose it not only in Delhi but with traders from all over the country
 unka kahana he ki jarurat padi to andolan bhi hoga
 We will keep opposing Walmart till the last time and will not allow Walmart to enter Delhi at any cost
 sitiai ke sanyojak brijesh goyal va hemanth gupta kaa kahana he ki maamla desh ke chote va majhole vyapaariyon se judaa he, isliye ham har tarah se iskaa virodh karenge
 The agreement that is going to happen between Walmart and Flipkart is not only a matter of concern for small and medium traders, but also for the government
 wallmart company kaa itihaas rahaa he ki yah jis desh main bhi gai he, vahaan ke sthaneey retailleron ko to puri tarah se chaupat kiya hi he, saath hi us desh kii arthvyavastha par bhi nakaaratmak asar padaa he
 The comments sitiai ke varisht upaadhyaksh pradeep gupta or mahasachiv ramesh ahuja ne bataaya ki bharat kaa retail bazaar lagbhag 40 lakh karod rupee kaa he
 This is why Walmart has been eyeing India for years
 lekin bharat sarkaar ko sochna chahie ki agar walmart jaisi company ko desh main ghusane diya jaataa he to yahaan ke chote va majhole vyapaariyon kaa kya hoga? hamaare desh kii arthvyavastha main chote va majhole vyapaariyon kaa bhi bahut yogadan he
 a large population of the country is attached to it and runs its livelihood
 doosraa ahm pahalu yah bhi he ki walmart zyaadaatar saamaan china se taiyaar karwaati he
 The introduction of Walmart into the country will again boost Chinese products
 unhone kaha ki sitiai walmart ke virodh main he or aane vaale dinon main na keval dilli balki puure desh ke vyapaariyon ke saath milakar iskaa virodh karegaa
 They say that if the need arises, there will be movement
 ham log aakhri samay tak walmart kaa virodh karte rahenge or walmart ko kisi bhi keemat par dilli main nahin ghusane denge
 CTI Senior Vice President Pradeep Gupta and General Secretary Ramesh Ahuja said that India's retail market is around Rs 40 lakh crore
 yahi kaaran he ki varshon se walmart kii najar bharat par lagi hui he
 But the Indian government should think that if a company like Walmart is allowed to enter the country, what will happen to the small and medium traders here? Small and medium traders also contribute a lot in our country's economy

 serial repist shankar shanivaar raat bengaluru kii central jail se bhaag gaya
 How ran samajhie ki ek dupliket chaabi se pehla lock kholaa, police kii vardi pahani, ek bans or ek fatty chadar ke sahare teen deevaaren faandi or bhaag gaya
 Shankar knew that the iron fence on the outside wall was not being run over for two days
 ab is maamle main jail ke 11 karmchaariyon ko suspend kar diya gaya he
 The Central Jail is built in the Rape of Women Police Constable and in Parappana Agrahara area on the outer border of Murderbengaluru
 isamen rahete hai kul 4 hajaar kaidi
 Shankar was one of them
 shankar ne tamilnadu ke kai jilon main lagaataar vaaradaaten kin
 First he would rape women and then kill them
 19 oktober 2009 ko shankar ko jab tamilnadu police ne pakadaa, tab vah ek mahila police consteble kaa rape or murder kar faraar tha
 He was kept in Coimbatore jail
 vahaan se 17 march 2011 ko vah court se sunwaayee se lautate samay faraar ho gaya
 The constable Chinnaswamy, who was tasked with bringing Shankar from the court, became so upset with the absconding that he committed suicide two days later
 may 2011 main use karnataka police ne jalki kasbe se pakadaa
 He has since been lodged in the Bengaluru Central Jail
 giraftaar ke samay police ne us par 10 lakh kaa inam ghoshit kar rakhaa tha
 Crazy Shankar, said the police started treatment and Shankar used to drive a truck and often targeted women who prostituted on the highway
 police ne jab use pakadaa or uski jaanch karwaai to pataa chalaa ki vah pagal he
 This is why he started treatment in a mental hospital
 shanivaar ko shankar bengaluru se 80 kilometre dur tumkur kii court main peshi ke liye gaya
 When he returned, he spoke of a deteriorating health
 is par use jail ke aspataal main bhartee kar diya gaya
 Electricity went to jail and disappeared
 On the night of Shankarshani, electricity went to the jail
 aspataal main bhi immergency ward main hi paryaapt raushnee thi
 Shankar was looking for this opportunity
 usne dupliket chaabi kaa istemaal kiya or aspataal ke ward se baahar nikal gaya
 During this, he wore a police uniform
 uske paas ek bans or ek fatty chadar thi
 With this, Shankar crossed two walls of 15 feet
 aakhri diwaar 30 feet oonchi thi, yahaan bhi wo bans ke sahare chadh gaya
 Usually, an iron fence on top of this wall keeps running
 magar do dinon se barish ho rahi thi
 Therefore the electrical connection to the wires was stopped
 shankar ko ye baat pataa thi
 On reaching the other side, he landed with the help of a sheet
 phir use kudana padaa
 During this time his leg must have also got hurt because the police found blood stains at that place the next morning
 police ko shankar ke bhaag jane kii khabar agle din subah kaidiyon kii ginati ke dauraan mili

 is maamle kii sunwaayee kar rahi peeth main chif justise ranjan gogoi, justise esake kaul or justise keem joseph shaamil hai
 The petitioners in the case have demanded an inquiry under court supervision of the deal

 So how did the Prime Minister announce the deal? These parties, put on behalf of the government, told the Supreme Court that we wanted a factory that could build 108 aircraft on time in India
 HAL ye kaam puraa karne kii sakasham nahin thi
 We needed them, who could build all these in the right way
 court ne kaha ki deal main technology ke transfar kii baat bhi thi, jisapar AG ne kaha ki HAL ke paas kushal log nahin the
 The AG told the court that the vendor had the option to choose an offset partner
 vendor ne jo partner chunaa, use france sarkaar ne bhi manjuuri di he
 CJI said on this that when it is said in the format that you have to give details, you cannot say that they did not give the details
 raksha mantralay ke adishnal secetrari ne court ko bataaya ki 2014 main jo badlaav kiye gaye the, vah 2015 main manjuur hue the
 If the weapon company gives offset details, we can also
 agar ditels nahin aati hai to ofaset kaa risk bad saktaa he
 The AG said that it was not written in the guidelines that the offset partner would be chosen by India
 ye jaruri nahin ki company ko ofaset partner kii jaankaree shuru main rakshaamantralay ko deni ho, ye jaankaree ofaset credit ke samay bhi di ja sakati he
 'which countries blow Rafale?' The CJI asked the government which countries are those who fly Rafale
 jiske baad sarkaar ne kaha ki france, katar or mistra hai jo rafel udaate hai
 The AG said that no guarantee has been given to the French government
 haalanki, baad main letters of comfort diya gaya tha
 The CJI asked if the government had any guarantee for these aircraft, to which the AG said that no
 'kargil ladaai kaa zikr'rafel par sunwaayee ke dauraan AG ne kaha ki aaj hamaari vayusena kaaphi kamjor he, agar airforce kargil ke samay main majboot hoti to ham itane jawan nahin ganvaate
 On this statement of the Attorney General, the Chief Justice said that Kargil was in 1999 and Rafael came in 2014, so do not talk such things
 CJI bole- airforce ke adhikari ko bulaayensunwaayee ke dauraan chif justise ne kaha he ki vah raksha mantralay kaa paksh nahin sunanaa chaahate hai
 He wants an Air Force officer to come and explain his needs
 atorni general ne CJI ko kaha ki kuch hi minuton main airforce kaa adhikari aa rahaa he
 Justice Joseph asked if the new aircraft that will come are the same as the old ones
 jisapar sarkaar ne kaha he ki nae vimaanon main kaaphi kuch nayaa hoga
 CJI asked what will happen in the new aircraft, has the public been told
 to sarkaar ne isse inkaar kiya
 Justice Joseph asked how the deal was signed when the Request for proposal (RFP) was withdrawn in April 2015 and the new RFP was not released
 chif justise ne kaha ki kya deal ke liye RFP jaruri hota he, jisapar AG ne jawaab diya ki aisa jaruri nahin he
 Prashant Bhushan made many big allegations in the Supreme Court
 Senior advocate Prashant Bhushan said that earlier in this deal, 108 aircraft were being made in India
 25 march 2015 ko dasolt or HAL main qaraar hua or donon ne kaha ki 95 fisadi baat ho gai he
 But 15 days later, during the Prime Minister's visit, a new deal was revealed in which 36 Rafale aircraft were confirmed
 or mek in india ko kinare kar diya gaya
 The defense ministry did not even know about this deal, the aircraft went from 108 to 36 in one stroke
 or ofaset reliance ko de diya gaya
 He said that the government is saying that they do not know the offset partner
 lekin process main saaf he ki bina raksha mantri kii anumati ke oisat tay nahin ho saktaa he
 To change the offset, the government changed the rules and implemented them immediately
 bhushan ne kaha ki sarkaar pehle hi do baar desh kii suraksha ko taak par rakh diya he, kyonki vah do baar sansad main rafel ke daam bataa chuki he
 During the hearing, the Supreme Court asked Prashant Bhushan to speak as much as needed in the court
 prashanth bhushan ne aarope lagaaya ki dasolt ne reliance group ke 240 karod rupee ke share kharide
 Prashant Bhushan said why Reliance was chosen for this deal
 uske paas to jameen bhi nahin thi, reliance formula kaa hi part thi
 Within 17 days, Reliance was given a license for land, defense manufacturing
 unhone kaha ki do sarkaron ke bich agreement immergency ke halaat main hota he, lekin abhi koi aisi sthiti nahin he
 Arun Shourie also told the government in the gherasupreme Court that Arun Shourie said that offset matters were changed later, Dassault chose Reliance
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki dasolt bhi is samay financial chrices se jujh rahaa he, yahi kaaran he ki unhone sarkaar kii har baat maani or reliance ke saath qaraar kiya
 Dassault also benefited from this deal
 arun shouri bole ki rafel deal kaa faisla pradhanmantri narendra modi ne bina raksha mantri or raksha mantralay kii salaah ke kiya he
 The other petitioner also told the government that the lawyer of the besieged Aam Aadmi Party leader Sanjay Singh said that the government did not disclose the price
 hamane kuch dastavej daayar kiye jo dikhaate hai ki sarkaar ne sansad se pehle do baar keemat kaa khulaasa kiya tha
 Different figures were given
 saansadon ne sansad main sawaal poocha tha
 The IGA signed in September 2016 in a reply given by the Ministry of Defense on 18 March 2016
 hathiyaar, upkaran, seva or rakrakhaav ke saath rafel vimaan kii keemat 670 karod he
 During the Rafale hearing, counsel for the petitioner Vineet Dhanda said how the Prime Minister can make a statement on this before any deal is fixed
 unhone kaha ki pehle 36 aircraft kii deal anouns kii gai thi, uske baad baat hui
 This answer should be given in affidavit
 yachikakarta ne supreme court main kaha he ki faisla lete vakt kaaphi gadabadi hui he
 The government has said in its document that negotiations in france-india started in May 2015, while in April 2015, the Prime Minister announced the deal
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki rafel vimaan kharidte samay kai sari conditions ko follow nahin kiya gaya
 He said that the Law Ministry had expressed doubts over a lot of issues related to this deal
 kanoon mantralay ne kaha tha ki france sarkaar ne isko lekar koi guarantee nahin di thi
 We are giving so much money, yet the government there is not giving any guarantee
 sarkaar ne apane dastavej main kharid kii prakriya, ofaset or daam ke bare main nahin bataaya he
 The new deal was signed in April 2015 but the process was not stated
 dastavej main ye bhi nahin bataaya gaya he ki kya raksha cameti se parmishan 36 aircraft ke liye lee gai thi yaa phir pehle kii hi parmishan thi
 He said that the papers are telling that the aircraft has the same things as before, so how are they saying that this deal is good

 5 crores for the 2016-2017 season
 vaise, ipel main isse pehle bhi jadeja par badi boli lag chuki he
 In the 2012 IPL auction, there was a strong bid for Ravindra Jadeja, and at that time there was a tie-breaker between the teams playing IPL Deccan Chargers and Chennai Super Kings to buy Jadeja, followed by Jadeja 9
 72 karod rupee main chennai superkings ke gaye the
 This time too, Jadeja got a good amount
 vaise jadeja or ipel kaa rishta kaaphi purana he, or mana jaataa rahaa he ki jadeja jis team main bhi jate hai, usee ke sitare gardish main pahunch jate hai
 Actually, Ravindra Jadeja has been a part of three teams in this tournament so far, and the fate of all three was lost
 ab ise sanyog kahen yaa kuch or, lekin jis team se bhi jadeja jude, us team se rab ruuth gaya
 The comments pyaar se 'sar jadeja' kahkar bulaae jane vaale team india ke rabindra ab tak ipel kii rajasthan royles, chennai superkings or kochi taskars tiimon ke liye khel chuke hai
 Kochi leaves have been completely cleared from the IPL, while Rajasthan and Chennai teams are facing two-year ban
 zaahir he rajkot team kii maalik intex company is baat ko nazarandaaz karnaa chaahegi or or jadeja bhi 'analki' jadeja bananaa pasand nahin karenge, lekin 'rockstar' ke naam se bhi mashhoor rabindra jadeja ke liye yah 'analki jadeja' vaala tamgaa kitna baari padegaa, yah kahana philhal mushkil he

 By the way, the relationship between Jadeja and IPL is quite old, and it is believed that the stars of the team in which Jadeja also goes, have reached the place
 darasal, is toornament main rabindra jadeja ab tak teen tiimon kaa hissaa rah chuke hai, or teenon kaa bhagya ruuth gaya
 Now call it a coincidence or something, but the team with which Jadeja was associated, got angry with that team

 kochi kaa patta ipel se puri tarah saaf ho chukaa he, jabaki rajasthan or chennai kii timen do-do saal kaa bain jhel rahi hai
 Obviously, the Rajkot team's owner Intex company would like to ignore this and Jadeja also would not like to become 'unlucky' Jadeja, but how heavy will this 'unlucky Jadeja' title be for Ravindra Jadeja, also known as 'rockstar'
 , It is difficult to say at the moment

 The Reserve Bank of India had examined in detail the questions of justification raised by the Videocon Group about the loan received from ICICI Bank but at that time it did not show any case of mutual transaction or benefit
 arabiai ke dastavejon ke anusaar usne yah jaanch 2016 ke madhya main kii thi
 The Prime Minister's Office had forwarded some complaints to him
 inamen aarope lagaaya gaya tha ki videokan samooh ne isiaisiai bank ko bada karj de rakhaa he or isiaisiai bank kii mukhya karypalak chanda kochar ke pati deepak kochar videokan ke saath mil kar chaandi kaat rahe hai
 According to documents and sources who know the matter directly, the Reserve Bank in its first comment in the matter in mid-july 2016 stated that ICICI Bank, together with a group of some banks, had given the Videocon group 1,730 crore under a debt consolidation scheme
 Had given a loan of Rs
 rigerv bank ne isi main aage yah bhi kaha ki use is maamle main hiton ke dwandv yaa takarav kaa koi maamla nahin dikhaa
 But the Reserve Bank had made a comment that it has not reached any conclusion about some sources of funds received by Deepak Kochhar's company newpower
 rigerv bank ne kaha tha ki newpavar ke saadon kii vaidhata kii pushti ke liye use mili dhan ke sroton kii jaankaree jaruri he or yah kaam jaanch agenciyaan hi kar sakati hai
 Later in December of the same year, the RBI said in a detailed comment on the allegations of transactions in exchange for loans received from ICICI Bank from ICICI Bank in 2007-12 that the bank was involved in a consolidation program of Rs 20,195 crore in the name of Videocon Group
 And the bank's share in it was Rs 1,750 crore
 is kaarykram main kai bank shaamil the or bainkon ke is samooh kaa netritv bhartiya state bank kar rahaa tha
 The Reserve Bank had said that since ICICI Bank was participating in this debt consolidation program like other banks, the charge of 'transaction' cannot be confirmed
 rigerv bank ne kaha tha ki newpavar rinuables li
 The subject matter of transfer of ownership of the bank was outside the jurisdiction of this bank
 yah company deepak kochar ne videokan ke pravartak dhoot parivaar ke saath mil kar disambar 2008 main banaayi thi
 The Reserve Bank in its remarks had said that such transfer can be investigated by Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) or Ministry of Company Affairs
 newpavar ko marishas ke raste mili puunji ke maamle main rigerv bank ne kaha ki yah puunji nivesh ke swat: sweekrut niyamon ke tahat aayi thi or isamen kisi ulanghan kii rapat nahin he

 He had also said that there was no clarity in the loan of Rs 64 crore received by New Power from the Super Energy Company through convertible debentures in shares
 us samay super energy kii 99
 99 per cent stake was in the name of Venugopal Dhoot, head of Videocon Group
 dastavejon or maamle ko sidhe jaanane vaale sutron ke anusaar rigerv bank ne is maamle main july 2016 ke madhya main apni pehali tippanee main kaha tha ki isiaisiai bank ne kuch bainkon ke ek samooh ke saath milakar ek rin samekan yojana ke tahat videokan samooh ko 1,730 karod rupee kaa rin diya tha
 The Reserve Bank further said that it did not see any case of conflict of interest or avoidance in this matter
 par rigerv bank ne yah tippanee jarur kii thi ki deepak kochar kii company newpavar ko mili dhan ke kuch sroton ko lekar vah kisi nishkarsh par nahin pahunch paaya he
 The Reserve Bank had said that to confirm the validity of the plains of newpower, it is necessary to know the sources of funds received by it and it can be done by the investigating agencies
 baad main usee saal disambar main arabiai ne videokan ko isiaisiai bank se 2007-12 ke daur mili rin ke badale lenden ke aaropon par vistaar se tippanee main kaha tha ki yah bank videokan samooh ke naam 20,195 karod rupye ke rin ke ek samekan kaarykram main shaamil tha or usamen is bank kaa hissaa 1,750 karod rupye kaa tha
 Many banks were involved in this program and this group of banks was led by State Bank of India
 rigerv bank ne kaha tha ki chunki is rin samekan kaarykram main anya bainkon kii tarah hi isiaisiai bank bhi hissaa le rahaa tha isliye ‘len dein’ ke aarope kii pushti nahin kii ja sakati
 The Reserve Bank had said that newpower Renewables Ltd
 ke swaamitv ke hastantaran kaa vishay is bank ke adhikaar kshetra se baahar kaa tha
 This company was formed by Deepak Kochhar in December 2008 in association with Videocon promoter Dhoot family
 rigerv bank ne apni tippanee main kaha tha ki aise hastantaran kii jaanch bhartiya pratibhuti evam vinimay board (sebi) yaa company maamalon kaa mantralay kara saktaa he
 In the case of capital received by newpower through Mauritius, the Reserve Bank said that this capital came under the automatically accepted rules of investment and there is no report of any violation
 tippaniyan The Reserve Bank said that the financial services division of the Ministry of Finance could decide to investigate any issue of any omission in giving information about the parties concerned or violations of the Foreign Exchange Management Act
 par rigerv bank ne marishas kii company first land holding company ke swaamitv par sawaal jarur uthaaya tha

 may main hue loksabhaa chunaav main pashchimi maharashtra ke marathavada main jab congress or rashtravaadi congress party (ensipi) ko sharmnaak haar kaa munh dekhnaa padaa or unhen mu_ bhar siten hi mil pain to gopinath munde ko raahat kii saans leni chahie thi
 But this clever politician of the BJP was fully aware of the ground reality
 unhone narendra modi ko bataaya ki party ko maharashtra par nigaah jamaaye rakhni hogi
 When Modi was preparing his cabinet in May, Munde was keen to keep the six parties contesting the election with Mahayuti happy
 ve jaanate the ki unki nigahen vidhansabha chunaavon par hai
 But with the death of Munde in a road accident near India Gate in Delhi in June this year, the worry of Mahayuti also came to an end
 isliye 25 sitambar ko vidhansabha chunaav kaa parchaa bharne ke liye jab sirf do din bache or pitrupaksh bitne ke baad navaratri kaa pehla shubh din aayaa to 25 saal se chali aa rahi mahayuti itihaas kii amaanat ban chuki thi
 At 9 pm, Aditya Thackeray, son of Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray, tweeted, "this alliance was since i was not even born
" main bijepi netaaon ke saath ekta or bhaichaare ke maahaul main palaa-badha
 "this sentimental statement was from the grandson of Shiv Sena founder Bal Thackeray, whose insistence is considered to be the biggest reason for the break-up of this alliance
" gathbandhan kii baaki partiyaan arpiai, esaspi, arsapi or shivasangram bhi jald hi apana rukh tay kar lengi
 But this break had its roots in the Lok Sabha election victory
 is aag main ghi kaa kaam bijepi ke us aantarik survey ne bhi kiya jisamen bataaya gaya ki agar chaaron partiyaan akele chunaav ladati hai to bijepi ko 288 main 134 tak siten mil sakati hai, jabaki shivasena 46 par simat jaaegi
 In such a situation, the scope of the alliance will remain after the elections
 saath hi congress se alag ho chuki ensipi ke liye bhi tab bijepi achhut nahin hogi
 That is why the BJP did not bow down
 party maanati he ki modi lahar main koi kami nahin ai he
 After all, the alliance won 42 out of 48 seats in Maharashtra in the Lok Sabha elections
 duusari taraf sattadhari congress-ensipi gathbandhan bhi tut gaya
 Here, Sharad Pawar's NCP was continuously pressurizing the Congress to increase its seats, but the Congress first avoided the NCP for a long time and later stopped listening to it
 congress kii ore se jo bhi hastkshep hua vah mukhyamantri prithviraj chavaan or kuch maamalon main ashok chavaan hi karte dikhe
 The way the party did not bring any powerful general secretary for talks, it is clear that the Congress was also in the mood
 udhar, ensipi kii daleel thi ki 15 saal ke gathbandhan main lagaataar congress kaa hi mukhyamantri bana he
 This time both parties will contest from 144-144 seats and the chief minister of both parties sat on the chair for two-and-a-half years
 yani donon hi paksh kuch is tarah kaa aditol ravaiya lekar chal rahe the ki gathbandhan kaa jua unke kandhe se utar jaae
 In a press conference announcing the break-up of the alliance on 25 September, NCP leaders Praful Patel, Ajit Pawar and Sunil Tatkar accused the Congress of not listening to their demands
 ensipi samay ke pahie main ghoomte hue vahiin pahunch gai he, jahaan se 15 saal pehle uskaa janm hua tha
 At that time, Congress leader Sharad Pawar left the Congress raising the issue of Sonia Gandhi's foreign origin and formed his party NCP
 lekin saz voton ke dar ne nai party ko turant hi congress se haath milaane ko majaboor kar diya
 After 15 years of incest, Sharad Pawar, a veteran sportsman of politics, is understanding the attitude of the wind
 udhar, hawa ko mulaayam singh yadav bhi bhaanp rahe hai
 The Samajwadi Party has shown keen interest in coming together with the Congress after the alliance broke
 party netritv ne bina samay ganvaae abu aasim azmi ko congress se baatcheet karne ke liye khulaa haath de diya
 But the question is, what will be the hand of Congress and NCP in this open competition? And is the latest equation going to open up a new role for Raj Thackeray's Maharashtra Navnirman Shiv Sena in Maharashtra politics
 haa, is chunaav main sab partiyon ke paas apane naare honge, lekin bijepi ke paas iske alaava modi naam kaa tavij bhi hoga

 Here, BJP National President and Union Home Minister Amit Shah told the forum that in this election, people will decide whether to stay with those who are in favor of Article 370 or who removed it and show Pakistan its place, their To be with bataa den ki amit shah, jharkhand ke mukhyamantri raghubar das ke jan aashirwad yatra ke shubharambh kaarykram main jamtada pahunche the
 Shah said in his speech that ever since Article 370 was abolished, a message has been sent to the whole world that Kashmir is an integral part of India
 unhone vipakshi dalon khaaskar congress or JMM ko aade haathon lete hue kaha ki in donon ne anuchhed 370 ko khatm karne ke nirnay kaa loksabhaa main virodh kiya
 You tell them, they will support him or those who have finished Article 370, will support him
 unhone logon se is mudde par haath uthaakar apana jan samarthan dene kii apil bhi kii
 Amit Shah, during his speech, tried to prove by giving many figures that ever since Narendra Modi's government was formed at the center, the state has got two and a half times more money from the Center than the UPA government in development

 Attorney General KK Venugopal on Wednesday, appearing for the government, said that any order on the matter should be held until the government completes the process of drafting the data protection bill
 centre sarkaar ne is prakriya ko 31 july 2017 ko shuru kiya tha

 Meanwhile, the Center has said in the court that it is ready to increase the deadline to link Aadhaar to about 135 government welfare schemes

 ekadam dubli-patali, print kaa salwar kurta or dupatta pahane, chehre par kaala chashma or saumy si muskaan, baatcheet main saralata or apnaapan- 28 saal kii aditi pados kii kisi ladki si lagati he
 These days, there is a lot in Aditi Singh, who is campaigning day-to-day with Toyota Fortuner, which makes it difficult for people to believe who they are
 charchaa he ki jab ve pehali baar congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi se milin to unhen bhi yakeen nahin hua ki ve kiski beti hai!aditi ne america ke duk uniwarsity se bijness management main post graduate hai
 Now politics is his business and management of election campaign is his real test
 aditi raibareli sadar se congress kii ummidavaar hone ja rahi hai
 This is the same seat on which his father and Bahubali leader Akhilesh Singh has been a five-time MLA
 akhilesh isi seat se maujuuda vidhayak bhi hai
 Akhilesh Singh has all the cases registered including murder, robbery, kidnapping and murder
 lekin, kshetra main unki chhavi robin hud jaisi he, jo amiron ko lut kar garibon kii madad karata he
 Independents also win elections by staying in Akhilesh jail
 har koi maanata he ki is seat par akhilesh singh ko haraana aasaan nahin he
 Due to declining health and age, this time Akhilesh Singh has decided to hand over his political legacy to his daughter
 don kii beti !ye sunanaa shaayad hi kisi ladkee ko pasand aae
 But when asked, Aditi laughs and says that she is now used to listening, now she does not mind it
 aditi kahati hai ki raajnneeti main utarane kaa faisla unka khud kaa tha
 His parents gave him a good education, but when his father said that his health was not such that he could run so much, he immediately decided to return to Rae Bareli and help his father
 aditi kahati hai ki unke pita kii image aisi he ki logon ko yakeen nahin hota ki ve or unki choti bahan donon ne videsh main jaakar ucch shiksha hasil kii
 But the reality is that despite his dangerous image, Akhilesh Singh is a father at home who loves children very much and is very serious about education
 kya pita ne kabhi bandook chalaanaa nahin sikhaaya?hansate hue aditi kahati hai ki unhen kabhi banduukon kaa shauk nahin rahaa lekin mauka mila to siikhnaa jarur chahengi
 Aditi is fond of driving and traveling, besides she likes to read books when she gets time
 shuruyaat main akhilesh singh khud congress party main rahe or party ke tikat par vidhayak bhi bane
 In Rae Bareli after splitting from the Congress a few years ago, he had plagued rahul-priyanka and Sonia Gandhi
 haalat yah thi ki pichley vidhansabha chunaav main akhilesh singh ke dar ke maare log priyanka kii sabha main nahin jate the
 In other areas, even the posters of the Congress Party could not be seen
 congress kii taraf se unke khilaaf mukademe bhi darj karaae gaye
 Despite this, how Aditi joined the Congress party and how she is going to contest on the Congress ticket is a big question
 kya yah buudhe hote akhilesh singh or congress party ke bich main majaburi kaa samjhauta he?aditi badi safagoi se kahati hai ki isamen kuch sachai ho sakati he
 Actually, the matter started when he met Priyanka Gandhi and Priyanka was impressed by seeing him
 raajnneeti ke bare main unke don pita ne unhen sabase kaam kii koun si salaah di?aditi kahati hai ki sabase kaam kii salaah unhone yah di kiraajnneetibahut mehnat kaa kaam he or kabhi bhi kisi par gussa mat karo bhale hi log tum par naaraaz hon
 Would she want to change her father's identity if she became an MLA? Aditi says that there is something in her father that is worth learning
 khaas taur par unke pita ki yah sikh behad kaam kii he ki sabase zyada unka khyaal rakho jo sabase garib hai
 But she believes that every man has his own way of working and in many cases he is different from his father
 aditi kahati hai ki apane pita kii vajah se unhen chunaav prachaar main dikkat nahin aa rahi he or zyaadaatar logon ne beti kii tarah pyaar de rahe hai
 Samajwadi Party has fielded its candidate in this seat despite an alliance between Congress High Commons Samajwadi Party and Congress
 lekin aditi ko isaki zyada chintaa nahin he or vah kahati hai ki uski phikrcongreshikaman karegaa vah sirf chunaav par dhyaan de rahi hai
