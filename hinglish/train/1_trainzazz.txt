 Let me tell you, BJP leader and lawyer Ashwani Upadhyay in his petition has demanded that the candidates should be banned against contesting more than one seat
 is maamle main supreme court ne sarkaar or chunaav ayog se apana jawaab daakhil karne ke liye kaha tha
 The commission in its affidavit filed in the court said that it is an injustice to the voters to contest elections from two places and then leave one seat
 isse aarthik boj padataa he
 Not only this, the Commission suggested that re-election expenses should be recovered from the person leaving the seat
 ayog ne kaha tha ki usne 2004 ke chunaav sudhaar prastaav main hi kaha tha ki kanoon main sanshodhan hona chahie or ek se zyada seat par chunaav ladane kii ijaajat nahin honi chahie
 However, the government opposed the petition, supporting the rule
 sarkaar ne kaha tha ki yah praavdhaan ummidavaar ko behatar vikalp pradaan karata he or loktantric vyavastha ke anuroop he
 Darsal Ashwini Upadhyay, in the petition, sought to declare Section 33 (7) of the Representation of the People Act illegal, allowing a person to contest from two seats
 yachika main ashvini upaadhyaay ne agar ummidavaar donon jagah se jeet jaataa he to use ek seat chhodani padati he or us chodi hui seat par dobaaraa up chunaav karaayaa jaataa he
 This increases the economic burden

 This case is pending in the Supreme Court

 The court has denied this

 kya sushamaa swaraj kaa yah bhaashan us disha main aakraamak kadam he
 i want to say very politely that after reading the speeches of the heads of the seven eight countries, it seemed that this much publicized platform of the United Nations is nothing but a provocative speech
 aap yuan kii website par jaakar in bhaashanon ko padhakar apana nirnay bana sakate hai
 Nowhere will you find such a magnificent collection of simple and superficial speeches
 agar bharat kii videsh mantri kaa bhaashan nahin hota to is par baat ho sakati thi ki sanyukt raashtra kii is sabha main die gaye saikadon bhaashan kaa matlab kya he
 Bangladesh did not even name India, while India's foreign minister took the name of terrorist attacks in Dhaka and Kabul
 kya saare desh aatankwaad ko lekar is tarah se mukhar nahin ho sakate the
 The President of France said that terrorists are becoming controlled over many countries, which is very important to stop
 boko haram or al kaayda ke kaaran puraa ilaaka asthir ho gaya he
 i want to say clearly that Africans have to be protected by Africans
 sena ko upkarnon se las karnaa hoga taaki ve inkaa muqabla kar saken
 France urges the United Nations that for how long we will continue to speak of condemnation and sympathy in case of a terrorist attack against the Allies
 agar france hamale kii ninda ko khanaapurti nahin bananaa chahta tha to kam se kam udi main hue aatanki hamale kaa zikr kar saktaa tha
 It was being projected as a big success in India that France has also strongly condemned it
 saaf he aatankwaad par bharat akele kii ladaai lard rahaa he, baaki desh khanaapurti kar rahe hai
 For them, fighting against terrorism means more than installing CCTV
 britain kii pradhanmantri ne somalia se aatankwaad bhagane main apane desh kii bhoomika kaa lanbaa gungan kiya or kaha ki aaj aatankwaad ke jis khatare kaa ham saamana kar rahe hai wo kisi ek desh se nahin aata he
 Rather it exists in different places
 jis tarah ke global network kaa wo istamaal karte hai, uske liye alag tareeke ke global jawaab kii zarurat he
 Terrorists are using banking networks
 airline ko nishaanaa bana rahe hai
 Britain has referred to many types of extremism based on violence
 nav najivaad kaa bhi zikr kiya he
 The comments videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj ne pakistan kaa naam nahin liya lekin ek jagah ve naam leti hai, jab ve kahati hai ki hamane do saal main mitrataa kaa wo paimaana tay kiya he jo pehle kabhi nahin tha lekin badale main hamen kya mila
 Pathankot, Bahadur Ali and Uri
 bahadur ali hamaare kabze main ek aatankwaadi he jiskaa qaboolnamaa ek zindaa saboot he ki pakistan seemapar aatankwaad main shaamil he
 Finally, the Foreign Minister went on to say that since 1996 India has been demanding a detailed discussion and resolution on terrorism, the United Nations Assembly has not reached it till date
 videsh mantri ne kaha ki ham aaj tak koi antarrashtriya maanak nahin bana sake, jiske tahat antkavaadiyon ko sazaa di ja sake yaa unka pratyrpan ho sake
 Kulmilkar's speeches i read, Sushma Swaraj spoke very clearly on terrorism
 bharat ke pradhanmantri narendra modi ne videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj ko tag karte hue twit kiya he ki 'videsh mantri ko badhai, sanyukt raashtra kii aam sabha main vyapak vaishvik muddon par thos, prabhavi or spasht rup se apni baat rakhane ke liye
 ' twit angrezi main tha, maine anuwaad kar bataaya he
 Congress has not found the Foreign Minister's speech effective
 congress pravaktaa randeep surajevaala kaa twit he ki sushamaa swaraj ke bhaashan se niraashaa hui he
 Why Sushma Swaraj, who has been hesitant to call Pakistan a terrorist nation, had responded to the four-point resolution of peace by Nawaz Sharif in this meeting
 kaha tha ki hamen chaar bindu kii zarurat hi nahin he
 Just leave terrorism and sit and talk
 kerala main pradhanmantri ne pakistan se yuddh kii jagah milakar garibi, berojgaare or kuposhan ke khilaaf yuddh kii baat kahi he lekin pakistan ko alag thalag karne kii baat bhi kahi he
 Is this speech of Sushma Swaraj an aggressive step in that direction? france ke raashtrapati ne kaha ki kai deshon par aatankwaadiyon kaa niyantran hota ja rahaa he jise rokna bahut zaruri he
 The entire area has become unstable due to Boko Haram and Al Qaeda
 saaf saaf kahana chahta hum ki africa logon kii suraksha africaiyon ko hi kerani hogi
 The army has to be equipped with equipment so that they can counter them
 france sanyukt raashtra se aagrah karata he ki kab tak ham mitra desh ke kilaaf aatankwaadi hamalaa hone par ninda or sahanubhuti kii hi baat karte rahenge

 bharat main badi kamyaabi ke taur par pesh kiya ja rahaa tha ki france ne bhi kadi ninda kar di he

 garmiyon main pasinaa aana ek aam baat he lekin kuch log aise bhi hote hai jinhen pasinaa na ke baraabar aata he
 If you think that sweating is a problem, then tell you that sweating is very important and beneficial for health
 visheshgy maanate hai ki paseene ke saath hi hamaare sharir main maujuud ashuddhiyaan twachaa ke rome-chhidron ke madhyam se nikal jaati hai
 It also benefits the skin
 ek adhyayan ke mutabik, jin logon ko pasinaa aata he ve un logon kii tulana main kahin zyada sehatmand hote hai jinhen pasinaa nahin aata
 This is a very important biological activity, which makes other physical functions better
 aise main jab agali baar aap paseene se tar hon to baichaiyn hone ke bajaay sochen ki ye ek jaruri jaivik kriya he lekin kya aap ye nahin jaananaa chahenge ki jinhen pasinaa nahin aata he, unhen kya-kya khatre ho sakate hai?pasinaa nahin aana ho saktaa he khatarnaak1
 If you do not sweat then you are more at risk of getting sunburn
 jin logon ko pasinaa nahin aata he unke sharir kaa taapmaana kam nahin ho paata he

 In such a situation, people who do not sweat get sick relatively quickly
 3
 If you do not sweat, you may have various skin diseases
 paseene ke saath hi sharir main maujuud vishakt padaarth bhi baahar nikal jate hai
 Apart from this, dust and smoke particles filled in the pores also turn out with sweat
 jisase keel-munhaason kii samasya nahin hone paati he
 4
 paseene ke madhyam se hamaare sharir main maujuud extra sault baahar nikal jaataa he
 The amount of salt and calcium in the body of people who do not sweat greatly increases
 aise main unhen kidney stone hone kaa khatra bhi bad jaataa he
 5
 agar aapako pasinaa nahin aata he to aapke ghaav bharne main bhi vakt lagata hoga
 The sweat glands also have stem cells that help in healing wounds quickly
 aise main pasinaa nahin aana chintaa kii baat ho sakati he

 Courtesy- Newsflicks centre kii endie sarkaar main shaamil shivasena ne mukhpatr 'saamana' ke jariye pradhanmantri narendra modi se pakistan adhikrut kashmir or baluchistan ko lekar sawaal kiye hai
 Referring to the action taken on the Baloch leaders in the editorial article, the party has written that this has happened to support India and Modi, so will the government send army to pok to free them now? In the Wednesday issue, Shivsainen wrote, ' Baloch leaders are being overshadowed by the support of PM Modi
 un par deshadroh kaa maamla darj kiya ja rahaa he
 They have to eat the air of jail
 ab modi kya karenge? netaaon ko mukt karwaane ke liye paak adhikrut kashmir me sena ghusaaenge yaa balooch netaaon par hone vaale daman ke khilaaf ek or bhaashan thonkkar uskaa dhikkaar karenge
 Baloch leaders welcomed Modi's statement, 'it is written further in the' want to liberate from the atrocities of Pakistan '
 " pradhanmantri modi dwaara 15 agast ko laal kile se pakistan ko fatkaar lagaai thi
 Because of this, the people of Balochistan, Gilgit have taken to the streets against atrocities on them

 bhartiya sansad par aatanki hamale kii aaj 16veen barsi he
 The winter session of Parliament was going on in 2001 during the nda's reign and on 13 December the lashkar-e-taiba and jaish-e-mohammed militants attacked there
 hamale main 5 aatankiyon samet 14 log maare gaye or 18 ghayal hue
 Indian security agencies claim that this whole incident was carried out by 3 dreaded terrorists Maulana Masood Azhar, Ghazi Baba alias Abu Jehadi and Tariq Ahmed sitting in Pakistan
 16 saal pehle bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) kii aguwai main centre main atal bihari vaajapeyi kii sarkaar thi or ab narendra modi kii aguwai main bhaajapa sarkaar desh main shashan kar rahi he
 But the real culprits of the terrorist attack on the Parliament called the temple of democracy have not yet been punished
 yun to bharat ne in aatankiyon ko pakadaney ke liye kai prayaas kiye, lekin aaj bhi ve hamaari giraft se baahar hai
 Know where and what the 3 big mastermind terrorists sitting in Pakistan are doing at the time of the attack
 moulana masood ajaharkukhyat aatankiyon main moulana masood ajahar kaa naam sheersh par aata he, 1994 main srinagar main gum rahe jaish-e-mohammad ke ajahar ko farvari main giraftaar kiya gaya tha
 In 1995, some foreign tourists were abducted by his accomplices to free this terrorist
 haalanki inamen se ek bhaagane main kaamyaab rahaa, jabaki baaki saare paryatak maare gaye
 After this, in 1999, the Dhar plane managed to hijack and rescue him
 vaajapeyi shasankaal main bharat se chhutne ke 2 saal baad hi usne bhartiya sansad par hamalaa kar diya
 He did not stop here, he is also believed to have played an important role in the 2008 Mumbai terror attack
 2016 ke pathankot aatanki hamale main bhi uski sandigdh bhoomika maani jaati he
 The Indian Army and security agencies blamed Azhar and his brother for the incident
 iske baad bharat ne antarrashtriya str par uski harkaton ke bare main bataaya, phir interpol ne uske khilaaf duusari baar red corner notice jari kiya
 India has been trying to declare Azhar an international terrorist, to which the US agrees
 lekin is maamle main china hameshaa vito laga detaa he
 Its organization jaish-e-mohammed has been declared terrorist groups, including India, many countries like America, Australia and England
 jabaki pakistan main ek tarah se use hero kaa darja mila hua he
 Pakistan does not take any action against India even after giving evidence on several occasions
 mumbai aatanki hamale ke baad bhi paak ne use giraftaar karne se manaa kar diya
 He even said that he does not know where Azhar lives, while media reports said that he lives in Bhawalpur, Pakistan
 saath hi vah paak kii kukhyat iesai kaa dulaara bana hua he
 Many times his videos addressing the Pakistani public also went viral, but the Pak government does not know anything

 He had many names, Abu Jehadi, Shahbaz Khan, Abu Hijrat
 lekin sabase apane logon main uskaa sabase charchit naam tha doctor
 The terrorist is believed to be the mastermind of the Kandahar plane hijack in 1999
 moulana ajahar ko chhudaane ke liye 1995 main videshi paryatakon ke apharan ke peeche bhi isi kaa naam tha
 Tariq Ahmed! In Pakistan, another mastermind of the terrorist attack on Parliament was Tariq Ahmed, who used to work with Ghazi Baba
 or usee ke kehane par ek oparation kii yojana bananaa shuru kiya
 In the meantime he met Masood Azhar and then all three carried forward their dangerous plan

 to us builder ke khilaaf epa ai aar darj ho sakati he
 Obviously, this is very comforting in terms of customers
 mumbai main aise hi ek nami builder ke sataaye hue prashanth balakrishnan kaa kahana he isse bilderon ke manamaani ravaiye par lagaam lagane kii ummid jaagi he
 But the builders consider it fatal for the business
 maharashtra chembar of houseing industry cridai ke adhyaksh dharmesh jain ke mutabik ek project ke liye tamaam sarkari vibhaagon se 50 se 60 parmishan leni padati he jisame 2 se 3 saal laganaa aam baat he
 Even after that, if a rule changes in the middle, then all the exercise has to be done again
 phir akele builder ko jimmedaar tehraane kaa matlab construction industry ko khatm karnaa he
 According to Anand Gupta, a member of the Builders Association of India, around 50,000 buildings live in Mumbai without occupation certificate
 iske liye sirf builder ko jimmedaar tehraana bemaani he
 If someone is responsible, there are other government departments and leaders ranging from BMC to 50 types of obstructions in the construction of buildings, but have given an open hand to build a slum
 ab police ke haath main bilderon ko pareshaan karne kaa nayaa hathiyaar de diya gaya he
 The comments building vyavsaay ko regularise karne or graahakon ke hit ko surakshit karne ke uddeshy se centre sarkaar kanoon banane ke saath ek regulatory bill bhi bana chuki he or sabhi rajya sarkaron ko bhi 6 maheene ke bheetar apane-apane draft bill banane ko kaha he
 The builders say that suddenly removing this type of circular without creating a regulatory body is not only harmful for the building business but also a loss for customers
 aaj jarurat he bilderon ke saath hi sarkari vibhaagon ko bhi jimmedaari tay karne vaali paardarshee niti kii taaki bhawan nirmaan vyavsaay ko badhaava mili or sabhi ko saste main ghar mil sake
 But in Maharashtra it is going upside down
 lekin builder ise vyavsaay ke liye ghaatak maan rahe hai
 According to Dharmesh Jain, president of Maharashtra Chamber of Housing Industry CREDAI, a project requires 50 to 60 permits from all government departments, which is common to take 2 to 3 years
 uske baad bhi agar bich main koi niyam badalata he to phir se sari kavayad kerani padati he
 Then to blame the builder alone means ending the construction industry
 bilders association of india ke sadsy anand gupta ke mutabik mumbai taqariban 50 hajaar buildingon main log bina okupashan praaanpatr ke rahete hai
 It is meaningless to just blame the builder for this
 agar koi jimmedaar he to biemasi se lekar duusare sarkari vibhaag or netaa hai jo building banane main 50 tarah ke rode atakaate hai lekin jhopra banane kii khuli chhot de rakhi he
 Now a new weapon to harass the builders has been given to the police
 tippaniyan With a view to regularizing the building business and securing the interest of the customers, the central government has enacted a regulatory bill along with legislation and has asked all the state governments to make their own draft bills within 6 months
 bilderon kaa kahana he ki bina regulatory body banaaye achaanak se is tarah kaa circular nikaalnaa naa sirf bhawan nirmaan vyavsaay ke liye nuksaandeh he balki graahakon ke liye bhi ghate kaa sauda he
 Today, there is a need for a transparent policy to fix responsibility for builders as well as government departments so that the building construction business can be promoted and everyone can get the house cheaply
 lekin maharashtra main to ulta hi ho rahaa he

 In the last 60 years, Dara Singh ruled the heart of India
 aaj kii peedi ko shaayad andaaza bhi naa ho ki akhaade se adaakaari ke maidan main utre daara singh bollywood ke pehle himain maane jate hai
 He has been the hero of the films of the Tarzan series
 film abhinetri mumtaj kaa kariyar sanvaarane main bhi sabase bada sahaara daara singh kaa saath hi sabit hua
 Showing a body in Bollywood would not open the way to stardom, if not Dara Singh
 ji haa, bollywood main aaj har superstar par shart kholkar masals dikhaane kii jo dhun savaar he, wo chalan shuru hua tha daara singh ke jariye
 At the time when the coin of Dara Singh's wrestling was going on in the whole world, then on this Gabru Jatt, 6 feet 2 inches, Bollywood was so moved that wrestler Dara Singh became actor Dara Singh
 aaj bhi bollywood daara singh ko us sitare ke taur par jaanata he, jisaki shohabat main aane ke baad hi mumtaj jaisi adaakara shoharat kii bulandiyon tak pahunchin
 Dara Singh's debut film 'sangdil' was released in 1952, with Dilip Kumar and Madhubala in the lead roles
 1955 main wo film 'pehali jhalak' main pahalwaan banakar aae, jisamen mukhya kirdaar kishor kumaar or vaijayanti maala ne nibhaayaa tha
 Dara Singh, who had a simultaneous presence in wrestling and films, was the first film as a hero, 'jagga dacoit'
 ' jiske baad wo bollywood ke pehle ection hero ke taur par chaa gaye
 Dara Singh paired with Mumtaz in the 1963 film 'faulad'
 shokh-chulabuli mumtaj or himain daara singh kii jodi kaa jaadu kareeb paanch saal tak silver screen par chaaya rahaa

 After wrestling, Dara Singh was most loved by films

 Dara Singh produced 8 films in Hindi and Punjabi, directed 8 films and also wrote the story of 7 films himself
 100 se zyaada filmon main adaakaari kar chuke daara singh kii aakhri yaadgaar film thi 'jab ve met', jisamen unhone karina kapur ke dadaji kaa kirdaar nibhaayaa
 He wanted to stay connected in films till the last moment, but due to increasing age and deteriorating health, Dara Singh said goodbye to light-camera and action in 2011
 koi ek kirdaar kaise kisi kii mukammal pahchaan badal detaa he, isaki misaal hai daara singh
 In the serial Ramayana, Hanuman's character gave him such a door-to-door identity that no one even remembers that Dara Singh was a world champion wrestler of his time
 ye wo kirdaar he, jisane pahalwaan se abhinayta bane daara singh kii puri pahchaan badal di
 In 1986, Ramanand Sagar's serial Ramayana was so created in the role of Dara Singh Hanuman that no one ever thought of making another artist Hanuman after this
 ramayana serial ke baad aae duusare puranic dharawahik mahabharat main bhi hanuman ke rup main daara singh hi nazar aae
 In 1989, when the mythology of 'love Kush' was put on the small screen, Hanuman was also played in it by Dara Singh
 1997 main ai film 'lav kush' main bhi hanuman bane daara singh
 The interesting thing is that Bollywood was seen in his Hanuman Un Dara Singh, whose film innings started with roles like Pahalwan and Dawak
 baad main wo raja or romance ke rajkumaar bhi bane
 And when the era of mythological films returned in the 1960s and 70s, he was made Bhima, sometimes Balaram and sometimes Mahadev Shiva, in view of Dara Singh's stature
 1964 main film 'vir bhimsen' main daara singh ne bhim kaa role nibhaayaa
 In the next year film Mahabharata, Dara Singh Hee too became Bhima
 1968 main film 'balram shrikrishna' main daara singh krishna ke bade bhai balram kii bhoomika main nazar aae

 In this film till then, Chakleti was in the role of hero Vishwajit Ram, while Laxman was played by Shashi Kapoor and Ravana was made Premnath
 'bajrang bali' release hone ke baarah saal saal baad jab ramayana serial shuru hua, to ramanand sagar ke jehan main hanuman ke role ko lekar koi duvidha nahin thi
 He fully agreed that no one could be better than Dara Singh for the role of Hanuman
 daara singh biimaar bhi ho sakate hai, ye baat un logon ke liye ajooba hi he, jinhone daara singh kii takat ke kisse sun rakhe hai
 This wrestler with a strong body of a religious priest from a small village in Amritsar, Punjab, had made a name for himself in the world before becoming a national champion in wrestling
 king kong se lekar duniya kaa koi aisa nami pahalwaan nahin tha, jise daara singh ne akhaade main dhul naa chataayee ho
 There is no other name in the wrestling arena bigger than this
 hind ke is rustam ke aage duniya ke har bade pahalwaan ne munh kii khai
 To the extent that it is praised, it is less and the same is the reality
 rustam-e-hind, apane jamaane ke kushti ke world champion, 19 november 1928 ko punjab ke amritsar ke dharmuchak gaanv main janme daara singh ko bachapan se hi pahalwaan banane kaa shauk tha
 God had sent him to the earth to become rustom-e-hind and that is why the height and height also lends itself to the senses of the best
 aaj kii peedi daara singh ko abhinayta ke taur par hi zyada jaanati he, lekin sachai ye he ki daara singh ko silver screen par staradam kushti ke akhaadon main unka dam dekhne ke baad hi mili
 Dara Singh, who wrestled in the haats and fairs during his boyhood, started making a mark and soon gained all the fame
 phir kya tha gaanv kaa pahalwaan chhora videshi pahalawaanon ko mazaa chakhaane nikal padaa
 In 1947 Dara Singh went to Singapore and defeated Tarlok Singh to become the Malaysian Champion
 agle paanch saal tak purvi asian deshon ke har nami-giraami pahalwaan ko dhul chataane ke baad daara singh 1952 main bharat laute or 1954 main bhartiya champion ban gaye
 Dara Singh's journey did not stop at that
 iske baad unhone kaamanwealth deshon ke ek se ek pahalawaanon ko haraaya, jisamen king cong, canada ke jorge gordianko, newjiland ke jon disilva or kai bade pahalwaan shaamil the
 In 1959, Dara Singh returned to India as the Commonwealth champion of wrestling
 kaamanwealth chapionships ke baad daara singh kaa mishan tha puri duniya ko apana dam-kham dikhaanaa
 This wrestler from India had a reputation for wrestling from almost every country in the world and became the world champion on 29 May 1968
 kushti kaa shahenshaah banane ke is safar main daara singh ne pakistan ke maazid akara, shane ali or tarik ali, japan ke ricodojain, european champion bill robinson, england ke chapian patrock samet kai pahalawaanon kaa gurur mitti main mila diya
 Dara Singh, who retired from wrestling in 1983, defeated more than 500 wrestlers, and the special thing is that most of the wrestlers danced to his house by Dara Singh
 unki kushti kala ko salaam karne ke liye 1966 main daara singh ko rustam-e-punjab or 1978 main rustam-e-hind ke khitaab se nawaaza gaya
 Among the wrestling enthusiasts of Dara Singh were India's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and many other Prime Ministers
 daara singh kii hasti ke aage achche se achche suurama chit ho jate the

 a petition has been filed against this in the Supreme Court

 The ordinance was taken out by the state government against the Supreme Court order granting reservation to Maratha SEBC in the admission process, which was filed in Nagpur High Court by Dr
 samir deshmukh or anya ne chunauti di thi
 This petition was rejected by the Nagpur High Court for technical reasons
 pichhali sunwaayee (10 june) main supreme court ne medical main maratha chaatro ke admician main rigerveshan maamle main koi badlaav na karne kii baat kahi thi
 The court said that the previous order did not require any change

 Nitish Kumar knew that by saying something and giving orders to the officials, there was no work on the ground and behind this was a rally of Narendra Modi in Patna's Gandhi Maidan in which one or more bomb blasts took place
 uske ek raat pehle bhi nitish kumaar ne tatkaaleen police mahanidesak abhyaanand ko pure gandhi maidan kii baariki se jaanch karne ke liye kaha tha lekin us par dhyaan nahin diya or aaj tak nitish kumaar kaa maananaa he ki agar shaayad unke aadesh ko maanakar saghan jaanch hoti to gandhi maidan main bam blast shaayad nahin hota
 Therefore, no effort was made in the security system
 bihar police ke saath-saath aam logon ko vishesh pamfalet die gaye the jisamen saaf-saaf bataaya gaya tha ki gurudware main jane ke pehle sir dhanke, koi paan-gutkha kha ke pravesh na kare
 Also, the turban and other decorum should be taken care of at the time of investigation
 iske alaava pulicekarmiyon ko spasht nirdesh tha ki koi bhi shraddhalu mili to uski har sambhav madad kii jaae
 Special pamphlets were given to the common people along with the Bihar Police, in which it was clearly told that before going to the gurudwara, before covering the head, no one would enter Pan-gutkha kha
 saath hi jaanch karne ke samay pagadi or anya maryaada kaa puraa khyaal rakhaa jaye

 This state comes first in terms of both population and voter in the country

 matadaataaon kii is badi sankhya main 50 pratishat se zyada kaa hissaa yuva or noujvaan votaron kaa he
 This is a crowd in which there is hunger for education, desire for better job and anger in the mind, inflation and the present system

 The churn continues to change the agenda of political parties to woo these new voters
 bharat nirvachan ayog pichley teen saalon se shat pratishat matadaata banane ke lakshya ko lekar kaam kar rahaa he
 For this, the campaign was planned in a systematic manner and officers were given the responsibility of making voters at the booth level

 Registration fairs were organized at district headquarters
 raajnneetik dalon ke saath baithken kar matadaata banane ke abhiyaan or punarikshit matadaata suchi ke liye salaah lee gai saath unase is kaary main sahyog bhi maanga gaya
 It was ensured that no 18-year-old person ceases from being included in the voter list by running a voter awareness campaign on behalf of the Commission
 inhen koshishon kaa hi nateeja rahaa ki vidhansabha chunaav 2012 tak matadaataaon kii sankhya 12 karod 48 lakh tak pahunch gai jisamen 52 lakh 56 hajaar nae matadaata hai jinaki aayu 18-19 varsh he
 By the time of the Lok Sabha elections 2014, this number increased significantly and the number of voters reached 13
52 million, it is expected to increase further
 darasal chunaavon ke prati logon ke udasin ravaiye ko lekar kendriya nirvachan ayog main arse se chintaa or manthan chal rahaa tha
 The concern is also natural because the voting percentage in the state has been really increasing disappointment
 aaazaad bharat main jab pehali baar sarkaar banane kaa avasar aayaa to varsh 1952 ke loksabhaa chunaav main maatr 39 pratishat vot pade
 For the first time in parliamentary history, 57 percent of the votes were cast when people reached the polling booths to express anger against the Emergency
 varanaa har chunaav main 45 se 54 pratishat ke bich hi voting hui
 In the history of Uttar Pradesh assembly elections, the highest number of 59 percent of the votes cast in the 2012 assembly elections is a record
 matdaan ke kam pratishat ko lekar kendriya nirvachan main chale manthan ke baad vrihad str par abhiyaan chalaa kar matadaata banane kaa nirnay liya gaya
 This campaign has been going on continuously for more than five years by the office of the Chief Electoral Officer in Uttar Pradesh
 isamen skool-collejon main shivi laga kar austrailia kii tarj par 18 saal puure karne vaale yuvaaon ko matadhikaar ke mahatv ko samajha kar matadaata banane ke liye prerit kiya gaya

 India only did it once when it defeated Brazil in 2010 in Chennai

 Earlier, India's tycoon depended on Somdev, who made good use of both his agility and mind after losing the first set easily and gave a befitting reply to his strong opponent who reached the pre-quarterfinals of the French Open this year

 Beginning the discussion on the Railway Budget in Rajya Sabha, BJP leader Balbir Punj said what kind of government is this in which the Prime Minister first praises the budget of Railway Minister and justifies the move to increase the fare
 baad main pradhanmantri hi dinesh trivedi ko mantrimandal se baahar kar dete hai
 Punj said that Trivedi did not have any personal budget
 iske prastaavon ke liye pradhanmantri or vitt mantri donon se sahmati lee gai hogi
 He said that if there is a problem in the budget, then how can the Prime Minister and Finance Minister be acquitted
 unhone kaha ki trivedi kii jagah ab ek aise vyakti ko rail mantri banaaya gaya he jinhone purv main assam main hui rail durghatana kaa jayja lene ke liye die gaye pradhanmantri ke nirdesh ko maanane se manaa kar diya tha
 Punj said that Trivedi's resignation has hidden many secrets
 kya trinmul congress ko yah pataa nahin tha ki rail yatri kiraayon main badhotaree hone vaali he
 He said that this is a very complicated matter and Trivedi should come himself and present his case in the House
 punj ne kaha, ‘kolkata main baith kar remote kaa batan dabaaya gaya or dilli main bukamp aa gaya
 Accusing the Prime Minister of bending his head in front of coalition politics, he said, "government can run from remote, not country
" ’bhaajapa netaa ne sarkaar se sawaal kiya ki jis anupaat main rail bajet main kiraayon main badhottaree kii gai he, kya us anupaat main yatriyon ko suvidha pradaan kii jaaegi
 He said that passengers had neither got the facility before nor were they expected to get more
 unhone kaha ki rail bajet ke ek hafte pehle hi maal haada badha kar puure desh par boj daal diya gaya
 He questioned the government that when former railway ministers Lalu Prasad Yadav and Mamata Banerjee kept saying repeatedly that the railway is in good condition and the railway was profitable, how did it become today that the railways had come to increase passenger fares
 unhone kaha ki is baat kii saraahna kerani chahie ki kam se kam trivedi ne rail bajet bhaashan main railway kii vaastavik tasviir prastut kii he
 Punj said that the government repeatedly talks about railway safety but a large number of people are killed every year in train accidents

 There are thirty-six figures in Azam Khan and Amar Singh, senior ministers of the Samajwadi Party who are always in the headlines, this fact is not hidden from anyone
 amar singh kaa naam aate hi ajam khan ke tevar talkh ho jate hai
 But when Azam Khan was asked about Amar Singh in the Assembly on Tuesday, he told a funny story to tell his mind

 When the father returned home, he asked his child what was prepared in the house today

 He thought that if i tell the truth, the mother will have to be killed and if i lie, the father will have to eat the dog
 ajam khan ne kaha ki amar singh ke sawaal par party main mere sthiti usee bachche jaisi he
 In fact, after coming back to the Samajwadi Party, Amar Singh is not getting the importance he expected
 isiilie vah khaase naaraaz chal rahe hai
 His displeasure is also with Jaya Prada that despite all efforts, he could neither get the cabinet status from the Uttar Pradesh government nor get the Uttar Pradesh Film Development Council president

 SI wife lost her temper in her husband's school

 In front of the school staff, the wife broke down on the husband with a belt
 jab patni ne hi pati par haath uthaa diya
 So how would the lady si's brother stay behind again
 chachaa or duusare staff ke rokane ke baavjood un donon ne hitendra kidhunaiki
 Meanwhile, Hitendra also tried to escape from them and retaliated but he failed

 Anna Hazare managed to grab the attention of such a large public especially because of two things in his menu
 unhone chahuun ore teji se paanv pasaarte ek aparaadh ko mudda banaaya
 Six decades old Indian democracy has seen many incarnations of corruption
 isane kabhi vyapaaree or raajnneetik mafia ke bich khushi-khushi hone vaale aadan-pradaan ke khaas kism ke baandh ko ab tod diya he
 Now he has not only polluted the river of the public but he has also poisoned the village well
 ab aisi koi jagah nahin jahaan isaki jaden na pahunchi hon
 This was the reason that people turned towards Anna by rising above the boundaries of class, caste and religion
 is andolan ne partigat vibhaajan ko bhi paat diya kyonki anna ek party ko duusare se behatar bataane vaali puraani tarkeeb se bilkul dur rahe
 The tone of the opposition at his hunger strike was increased only because no ruling party could protest against itself
 sarkaar ko kisi bhi andolan kii maar jhelni padati he kyonki bhrashtachar kaa taalluk hi satta se hota he
 It is difficult to be corrupt after being removed from power, but not impossible
 yuvaaon ne virodh ke pratik ke rup main jo tirangaa pahana vah rashtriya dhvaj kii khaadi thi na ki congress kaa koi maanak
 Similarly, if Hazare had been fasting in Kaban Park in Bangalore, you would not have seen so many saffron flags waving in the air there
 yahi vah virodhabhas he, jisaki vajah se bhrashtachar ke khilaaf laalkrishna adwani kii prastaavit rathyatra kii hawa nikal jane kaa andeshaa he
 This will be a journey which has no clear point
 vyaktigat rup se adwani is baat ke liye jaij taur par fakhr kar sakate hai ki chunaav ke dauraan un par ek vyavsaayee se rishwat lene ke narsingh raav sarkaar ke aarope lagane par unhone sansad se istipha de diya or adaalat se bari hone par hi ve loksabhaa main waapas aae
 But in 2011, he is not doing this to further cement his personal reputation
 ve bhaajapa ke netaa bhi hai
 They cannot be so clumsy as to say that the BJP has never dealt with the tainted money
 unhone aisa kiya to jaahir he, koi un par yakeen nahin karegaa
 From a political perspective, the BJP has benefited a lot from Anna's movement
 par yah to yun hi mil jane vaala phayda he
 As soon as she tried to tell herself to be the embodiment of honesty, she would get into trouble
 janata party main shaamil dalon ne thik isi tarah 1974 or 1975 ke jaiprakash narayan ke andolan kaa 1977 main phayda uthaaya tha
 But Mrs
 Indira Gandhi did not allow her the opportunity to commit terrible mistakes and put the leaders of these parties behind bars and provided them with temporary martyrdom
 vipahni partiyon par ab 2011 main us tarah kii meharbaani koi nahin karne vaala
 On the other hand, there is a threat of epidemic of travel in Uttar Pradesh, where politics has reached the verge of becoming a tour guide

 Now if they want to be a little lighter then its purpose is personal, not regional
 ek ehtiyaatah ahmedabad se dilli kaa rasta ek-ek kadam chalakar tay karne main hi budhimaani he
 When you bounce on Polwalt, you have absolutely no idea where you will fall

 And time is never absolute
 iskaa jhukaav amuman satta pratishthan kii ore hota he
 Power acquisition is also a process
 bhaajapa ko is samay kaa upyog puraane, maujuuda or sambhavit saathiyon ke saath gathjod majboot karne main karnaa chahie
 The government cannot make it alone
 use bihar style kaa, rishton kaa ek vyapak network bananaa hoga, jisaki prerak shakti sushasan kaa ek nunatam kaarykram ho
 It is durable because it has no place for blank sentimentalism
 loktantr main asambhavit ashavad ko badhaava dene ke liye jodtod kii bahut gunjaaish nahin hoti

 britain kii ek adaalat ne dakshin-purvi england main chaaku kii nok par ek mahila se balaatkaar or lut ke liye bhartiya mul ke ek vyakti ko 15 saal jail kii sajaa sunai he
 Islewath Crown Court found Diljit Grewal guilty of rape, sexual harassment and theft and sent him behind bars for 15 years on Friday
 sajaa puri karne ke baad paanch saal tak usapar najar rakhi jaaegi
 The court was told how Grewal (28) went to the 30-year-old woman's house in Hiligandon in April this year and then threatened to kill her with a knife
 greval nirantar dhai ghante tak mahila ke saath marpet karata rahaa or phir uskaa phone churaakar paise kii maang karne laga
 The woman gave him the money out of his bag, but he still kept checking his house for more money
 iske baad vah faraar ho gaya
 After Grewal left, the woman heard an incident on the phone from her friend outside the UK who contacted the police
 iske baad police ne use giraftaar kar liya
 The officer investigating the case, Mark Palmer, said, "I also hope that it will encourage victims of sexual assault to come forward
 saath hi unhen yah vishwaas dilaaegaa ki adhikari is prakaar ke aparaadhon ko gambhirtha se lete hai
 " vitt varsh 2018-19 ke liye iskar ritern bharne kii antim taarikh 31 july he
 Employed people have also started getting Form 16 from their offices
 aise main yah jaan lenaa jaruri he ki is saal kaa iskar ritern bharte samay ve koun si chijen hongi jo isi saal se vibhaag kii ore se laai gai hai
 For example, changes in the format of the form, which information has to be given more, etc
 chartered accountint ankit gupta kehete hai, ‘’is saal kai nae badlaav aae hai jo na keval vyaktigat karadaata balki sabhi tarah ke karadaataaon ke liye jaananaa jaruri hai
 The purpose of the government behind these changes is to collect as much information related to taxpayers' income and tax, so that tax evasion can be curbed
 ’’is saal hue ye nae badlaavis varsh jab koi karadaata apana inakam tex ritern file karne baithegaa to use sabase pehle apane pan number ko aadhaar se link karnaa jaruri hoga
 Till last year, it was necessary to give information only in the form
 lekin is saal se pan or aadhaar link karne kii anivaaryta he
 Taxpayers whose annual income is up to five lakh rupees and there is no income tax refund claim, can no longer file offline returns
 unke liye online ritern file karne kii anivaaryta he jo pichley saal tak nahin thi
 Till last year, taxpayers could also file their returns through paper
 iskar ritern form main pensioner ke naam se nayaa kollam joda gaya he
 Taxpayers who receive income in the form of pension will have to specify the source of income
 anya strot se praapt aay kaa khulaasa karnaa bhi is saal se jaruri hogi
 Till now the amount of income received from other sources was written
 lekin is varsh se yah bataanaa hoga ki aay kaa strot kya he?iskar form main is saal do nae section 80titibi or 80jijie shaamil kiye gaye hai
 80 TTB relates to tax benefit on interest received on FD to senior citizen
 vahiin 80jijie kaa sambandh donneton ke liye di gai raashi par milane vaale byaaj se he
 From this year, more information will have to be given regarding the capital gains to be made on selling the property
 masalan, kharidaar kaa naam, pan number, property kaa puraa pataa, bikri kii raashi, property main kharidaar kii hissedari aadi
 Detail has been sought from taxpayers whose income from agriculture is more than five lakhs
 maangi gai jaankaree main kheti vaali jameen kaa pataa, jameen kii paimaaish, jameen kaa malikana haq yaa batai par samet vibhinn jaankariyaan deni hongi
 If a taxpayer has given amount in the form of donation during the financial year, then he has to tell how much amount has been given in cash and through other means
 aisa isliye kyonki nakad main do hajaar se zyada daan nahin diya ja saktaa he or kar laabh kii seemaa bhi 2000 rupye hi he
 If a taxpayer wants to get the amount of income tax refund soon, then he has to file such account while filling the return which is already valid i
e
 recorded in the books of Income Tax Department and transaction has been done in that account with the department 
 vitt varsh ke dauraan agar kisi aay par tidisi kataa he to clem karte samay yah bataanaa hoga ki aay ko kin mad ke antargat darshaya gaya he
 It should be the same income that the tax deducted taxpayer is claiming
 aise vyaktigat karadaata jo kisi company main nideshak he to ve ITR 1 yaa 4 nahin bhar sakate hai
 It will be necessary for them to fill ITR 2
 iske alaava itiaar 4 bharne vaale karadaataaon ke liye sabhi jiesti number turnover ke saath iskar bharte samay darj karne jaruri honge
 So keep this in mind while filing income tax returns this year
 samay se iskar ritern na bharne par aapako penlti kaa bhi saamana karnaa padegaa
 In such a situation, do not forget to fill your returns in time

 ) england ke tej gendbaaji james anderson ne bhartiya captain viraat kohli par bada hamalaa kiya he
 Anderson said, "kohli feels that as long as India is winning, it does not matter if he does not score runs", then he is lying
 james anderson kii maane to agar bhartiya captain yah kahata he ki ek agast se shuru ho rahi paanch test maichon kii siries main vyaktigat form myne nahin rakhegi, to vah jhooth bol rahe hai
 In fact, Kohli struggled to score runs in England in 2014 and he was able to score 134 runs in five Tests which is one of his worst performances in Test cricket
 kohli haalanki england ke khilaaf 2016-17 kii gharelu siries ke dauraan england ke khilaaf bharat kii 4-0 kii jeet ke dauraan paanch test main 655 ran banane main safal rahe the
 At the beginning of the current tour, Kohli laughed off questions about his form, saying that he wanted to enjoy playing here and as long as the team was doing well, he was not worried about his personal form
 anderson ne kaha, 'bharat main yahaan jeetne ke liye beshak yah myne rakhata he, viraat apni team ke liye ran banane ke liye betaab hoga, jaisaa ki aap captain or duniya ke sarvshereshth khilaadi main se ek se ummid karte ho
 The 35-year-old fast bowler has a superb record against Kohli, having dismissed Kohli four times in 6 innings in the 2014 tour
 kul milakar test maichon main anderson kohli ko paanch baar out kar chuke hai
 Anderson, however, struggled during the 2016 India tour and was able to pick up four wickets in three Tests
 anderson ne kaha, 'aaj cricketer match footage dekhakar hi nahin, balki ateet ke anubhav se bhi sikhte hai, isliye main ummid karata hum ki kohli ke str ke ballebaaj ne yahaan pichhali siries (2014 main) se siikhaa hoga
 He said, "I am sure that he will be working hard on specific aspects of his game and this will make the struggle between him and the rest of our bowlers not only me but very exciting
" ' england main philhal kaaphi garmi he or aagaamee siries main halaat bharat ke adhik anukool ho sakate hai
 Kohli scored 60 in six limited-overs innings on the current tour
 2 kii ausat se 301 ran banaae hai
 India won the T20 international series 2–1, while England won the ODI series by a similar margin
 kohli ne ekadivasiy siries ke dauraan do ardhashatak jade (nottingham main 75 or leeds main 71) jo darshata he ki vah achche form main hai
 When asked about this, Anderson said, "it is very difficult to answer because you think the red ball swings more and has more seam but it is not
" 'unhone kaha, 'viraat jaisaa ballebaaj gend ko itani der se kheltaa he ki uske paas bahut samay hota he or lagata he ki aap dhime gendbaaj ho, kabhi-kabhi safed gend ke cricket main jab ballebaaj laal gend ke cricket kii tulana main adhik aakraamak hone kaa prayaas karata he, to aap adhik maukey bana sakate ho

 When bowling all these, Anderson was asked to choose the best batsman in the world right now, he said, 'to be honest, i do not like bowling any of them
 ' unhone kaha, 'inamen se kisi ek ko chunanaa mushkil he kyonki ve sabhi apane apane tareeke se alag hai, unamem kaaphi visheshtaayen hai, jo chijen unhen duniya ke anya ballebaajon se upar rakhti he vah khel ke vibhinn praaroop main saamanjasy baithaana he

 Significantly, Pakistan has stopped flying in its airspace after the Indian Air Force attacked the terrorist camps of jaish-e-mohammad in Balakot on February 27
