 The Supreme Court canceled the bail of rjd's Bahubali leader and mafia don Shahabuddin
 iske baad ek baar phir is bahubali netaa ko jail kii hawa khaani padegi
 The Supreme Court has ruled the Bihar High Court ruling nullifying it
 abhi kuch din pehle hi shahabudadeen ko bhagalpur jail se reeha gaya tha
 His name has often been in the news due to his involvement in criminal cases
 ye bihar kaa aisa netaa rahaa he jo jo siwan se nikalakar puure bihar main chaa gaya tha
 Who is Mohammad Shahabuddin Shahabuddin is a name that everyone in Bihar knows
 mohammad shahabuddinka janm 10 may 1967 ko siwan jile ke pratappur main hua tha
 He completed his education from Bihar
 raajnneeti main eme or piechdi karne vaale shahabuddin ne hina shahaab se shaadi kii thi
 They have a son and two daughters
 shahabuddin ne college se hi aparaadh or raajnneeti kii duniya main kadam rakhaa tha
 The story of Mohammad Shahabuddin who looks like a film character also looks filmy
 unhone kuch hi varshon mempraadh or raajnneetimen kaaphi naam kamaaya
 Shahabuddin's name first appeared in a criminal case in the eighties
 1986 main unke khilaaf pehla aapraadhik mukadmaa darj hua tha
 After this, several criminal prosecutions were written in his name
 shahabuddin ke badhate haunsale ko dekhakar police ne siwan ke hussainganj thane main shahabuddin kii historishit khol di
 a category historyheater was declared
 choti umr main hi aparaadh kii duniya main shahabuddin janaa mana naam ban gaya
 His strength was increasing
 raajnneeti main shahabuddin kaa udayraajnneetik galiyaaron main shahabuddin kaa naam us vakt charchaaon main aayaa jab shahabuddin ne lalu prasad yadav kii chhatrachhaaya main janata dal kii yuva ikai main kadam rakhaa
 Stars were high in politics
 party main aate hi shahabuddin ko apni takat or dabangai kaa phayda mila
 The party gave the assembly ticket in 1990
 shahabuddin jeet gaye
 Then won the election again in 1995
 is dauraan kad or bad gaya
 Seeing the strength, the party gave him a Lok Sabha ticket in 1996 and Shahabuddin won
 1997 main rashtriya janata dal ke gathan or lalu prasad yadav kii sarkaar ban jane se shahabuddin kii takat bahut bad gai thi
 Shahabuddin became another name for terror
 a 2001 report by the People's Union for Civil Liberties in the States revealed that the RJD government was giving protection to Shahabuddin during legal action
 sarkaar ke sangrakshan main vah khud hi kanoon ban gaye the
 The power of the government gave him a new shine
 police shahabuddin kii aapraadhik gatividhiyon kii taraf se ankhe band kiye rahati thi
 Such was the terror of Shahabuddin that no one dared to testify against him in any case at that time
 siwan jile ko vah apni jaagir samajhate the
 Where the leaf did not move without his permission
 police or prashasnic adhikari rahe nishane paratakat ke nashe main chur mohammad shahabuddin itnaa abhimaani ho gaye the ki vah police or prashasnic adhikariyon ko kuch nahin samajhate the
 It became his pastime to beat the officers on the day he arrived
 yahaan tak ki vah police waalon par goli chalaa dete the
 In March 2001, when police arrived to serve a warrant against RJD local president Manoj Kumar Pappu, Shahabuddin slapped the officer Sanjeev Kumar, who made the arrest
 or unke aadamiyon ne police waalon kii pitayee kii thi
 The shootout between the police and Shahabuddin supporters was in the limelight in the Manoj Kumar Pappu case
 police ne manoj or shahabuddin kii giraftaar karne ke makasad se shahabuddin ke ghar chhapemari kii thi
 For this, apart from the Bihar Police troops, the help of Uttar Pradesh Police was also taken
 chaape kii us karrwai ke dauraan do pulicekarmiyon samet 10 log maare gaye the
 Police vehicles were set on fire
 maukey se police ko 3 eke-47 bhi baraamad hui thi
 Shahabuddin and his companions escaped from the scene
 is ghatana ke baad shahabuddin par kai mukademe darj kiye gaye the
 Shahabuddin's rule used to run in Siwan Shahabuddin was running a parallel government in Siwan district till the early 2000s
 unki ek apni adaalat thi
 Where people used to have their decisions
 vah khud siwan kii janata ke paariwarik vivaadon or bhoomi vivaadon kaa nipataara karte the
 Even the consulting fees of doctors of the district used to decide the same
 kai gharon ke vaivaahik vivaad bhi vah apane tareeke se nipataate the
 During the Lok Sabha elections in the year 2004, he did special operations in many places
 jo media kii surkhiyaan ban gaye the
 Jailed contested elections were held in the hospital, Shahabuddin was arrested in 1999 for the kidnapping and suspected murder of a CPI (ML) worker, eight months before the Lok Sabha 2004 elections
 lekin chunaav aate hi shahabuddin ne medical ke aadhaar par aspataal main shift hone kaa intjaam kar liya
 a full floor of the hospital was kept for him
 jahaan vah logon se milte the, baithken karte the
 Used to review election preparation
 vahiin se phone par vah adhikariyon, netaaon ko kahkar logon ke kaam karaate the
 There were heavy security arrangements on that floor of the hospital
 halaat ye the ki patna hai court ne thik chunaav se kuch din pehle sarkaar ko shahabuddin ke maamle main sakht nirdesh die
 The court asked Shahabuddin to be sent back to jail
 sarkaar ne majaburi main shahabuddin ko jail waapas bhej diya lekin chunaav main 500 se zyada booth lut liye gaye the
 It was alleged that this work was done at the behest of Shahabuddin
 lekin dobaaraa chunaav hone par bhi shahabuddin siwan se loksabhaa saansad ban gaye the
 But he was given a tough fight by Om Prakash Yadav of JD (U) who contested against him
 chunaav ke baad kai jedy (you) kaaryakartaaon kii hatya hui thi
 Shahabuddin's bad times had started since the 2004 election, a life-long murder and kidnapping
 is dauraan shahabuddin ke khilaaf kai maamle darj kiye gaye
 Political rivalry was also increasing
 november 2005 main bihar police kii ek vishesh team ne dilli main shahabuddin ko us vakt dobaaraa giraftaar kar liya tha jab vah sansad satr main bhaagedari karne ke liye yahaan aae hue the
 In fact, many illegal modern weapons, army night vision devices and weapons made in Pakistani arms factories were recovered from his ancestral home during a police raid at Pratappur in Siwan
 hatya, apharan, bambaari, avaidh hathiyaar rakhane or jabaran vasuuli karne ke darjanon maamle shahabuddin par hai
 Shahabuddin was sentenced to life imprisonment by the court
 chunaav ladane par rondalat ne 2009 main shahabuddin ke chunaav ladane par roak laga di
 At the time, Shahabuddin's wife Hina Shahab filed the papers in the Lok Sabha elections
 lekin vah chunaav haar gai
 Since then, this Bahubali leader of RJD is locked in the Mandal Prison of Siwan
 shahabuddin par ek saath kai maamle chal rahe hai or kai maamalon main unhen sajaa sunai ja chuki he
 Even in this assembly election, Shahabuddin can convey his message to the people in Siwan, who should vote and who should not
 kaha jaataa he ki bhale hi shahabuddin jail main the lekin unka rutaba tab bhi siwan main kaayam rahaa
 And now after coming out of jail, he has started showing his attitude
 dilli or centre ke bich khinchataan kam hone kaa naam nahin le rahi
 Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has now directly surrounded the PMO
 kejariwal ne shanivaar subah-subah twit kar kaha ki pradhanmantri karyaalay (PMO) dilli main dakhal dena band kare
 Kejriwal said that both Congress and BJP are demanding the removal of Hinzib Jungko? It is amazing

 ' Several important evidence was found by the investigating agencies against the accused Sadhvi Pragya Singh in the Malegaon blast case
 usee ke aadhaar par uski giraftaar hui thi
 The most significant evidence of these was the motorcycle used in the blast, registered in the name of Pragya Singh
 iske alaava sadhvi pragna or sandigdh hamalavar ke bich phone par hui baatcheet kuch ansh agenciyon ko mili the
 Which showed that a meeting was held in Bhopal to plot the blast
 jisamen sadhvi bhi maujuud thi
 Pragya Singh Thakur has many allegations
 darasal, maharashtra aatankwaad-rodhi daste (aties) ne use maalegaanv visphot ke pramukh shadyantrkariyon main se ek bataaya tha
 On September 29, 2008, 7 people were killed and 101 were injured during the blast in Malegaon
 is maamle main oktober 2008 main pragna singh ko giraftaar kiya gaya tha
 She is currently facing charges including murder, attempt to murder, criminal conspiracy, and promoting enmity between various groups based on religion, including the Unlawful Activities Act (prevention)
 adaalat ne paaya ki aaropee pragna ne aatank failaane or samaaj main sampradayik daraar paidaa karne ke uddeshy se is sajeesh kii yojana banaai thi
 The bomb was fitted with an Improvised Explosive Device (IED) in a golden colored LML Freedom motorcycle
 wo motorcycle pragna singh thakur ke naam par panjikrut thi
 Sadhvi was arrested by the ATS
 aties kaa kahana tha ki sadhvi ne apane kareebi sahyogi raamji kalsangra ko visphot ke liye motorcycle muhaiyaa karai thi
 He was also a wanted accused in the case
 2011 main is maamle kii jaanch aties se lekar rashtriya jaanch agency (NIA) ko saunp di gai thi
 But in 2016, when the NIA filed its first final chargesheet in the court, it gave a clean chit to Sadhvi Pragya
 enie ne kaha ki aties ne record main jis ahm saboot yani motorcycle kaa zikr kiya he, unki jaanch main paaya gaya ki vah sadhvi ke naam par panjikrut to thi, lekin uskaa kabje kisi or ke paas tha
 The NIA argued that the motorcycle had been used by Ramji Kalsangra for two years
 isliye sadhvi is ghatana se judi nahin thi
 The NIA said that other evidence also included statements, which were all withdrawn, so no case was made against Sadhvi
 ye baat abhiyojan paksh ke gavaah or kalsangra ke chachere bhai ke bayaan par bhi nirbhar karti thi
 She said in her statement that she had heard a conversation between Sadhvi Pragya and Kalsangra
 jisamen wo log visphot kii baat kar rahe the
 Sadhvi had asked Kalsangra why few people were hurt by this
 enie ne aties par aarope lagaate hue kaha tha ki wo us gavaah ke bayaan par bharosa nahin kar sakate kyonki wo gavaah aties ke haathon istemaal kiya ja rahaa tha
 After this, the court said that in such circumstances, the witness can be tested only in the witness box to know the truth from the mouth
 haalanki is sabake baavjood adaalat ne pragna ko aarope mukt karne kii yachika ko khaarij karte hue bataaya tha ki anya saakshyon se saaf he ki dhamaake se pehle bhopal main hui baithak main pragna maujuud thi
 a witness had told the ATS that Pragya's co-accused Lt Col Prasad Purohit had stressed the need to expand the activities of his organization Abhinav Bharat, citing the growing jihadi activities
 gavaah ne kathith taur par aties ko bataaya tha ki karnal purohit ne muslim bahul ilaake main bam visphot ke saath musalamaanon se badla lene ke bare main apni raay jaahir kii thi
 Pragya Singh Thakur then showed readiness to provide people for this work
 enie ne daawa kiya ki agency ne phir se gavaah se poochtacha kii or vah apane bayaan se mukar gaya
 However, the special court said that during the trial it would be seen which of the two statements of the witness is correct
 is cese se jude mukademe main anya sabooton ke taur par aaropee karnal purohit or ramesh upaadhyaay ke bich hui wo baatcheet bhi shaamil he, jisamen ve pragna kii giraftaar par charchaa kar rahe hai
 According to the prosecution, both of them were reportedly discussing the motorcycle and possible rescue from it
 karnal purohit ne sadhvi se kii gai poochtacha kaa zikr karte hue kathith taur par upaadhyaay ko bataaya ki "singh ne ek chota geet gaaya he
 Because Pragya had revealed Purohit's name in this case
 adaalat ko visphot se pehle ke maheenon main pragna singh thakur, sudhakar chaturvedi or anya sah-abhiyukton samet do faraar aropiyon ke bich phone par hui baatcheet par bhi bharosa jataayaa
 Pragya had allegedly spoken to the accused accused Sandeep Dange three days before the blast, the day of the blast and the next day
 adaalat ne kaha ki ye vikat paristhitiyaan visphot main unki bhagidaari kaa majboot shaq jaahir karti hai
 The court dismissed the plea for acquittal of Sadhvi Pragya, saying that it has to be kept in mind that according to the statements of witnesses before the ATS officer, accused No
1 had agreed to provide people for the blast
 donon jaanch agenciyon aties or enie ke anusaar, faraar aaropee ramchandra kalsangra or sandip daange hi bam ke plantres hai
 Therefore, the above points cannot be ignored at first sight
 ab tak is maamle main 106 gavaah pesh hue
 All of them were mainly injured in the blast
 jinhone is cese main apana bayaan puraa kar liya he
 Pragya was last produced in court on October 30
 jab uske khilaaf aarope tay kiye gaye the or usne adaalat se use doshi qaraar naa dene kii apil kii thi
 Before coming to the wheelchair in the court, Pragya Singh Thakur claimed that all the allegations against him were false and all this was a conspiracy of the Congress party
 apni pehali jamaanat yachika main usne daawa kiya tha ki vah breast cancer se peedit he or vah kamjor ho gai thi or bina sahare ke chal nahin sakati thi

 nift ne desh ke vibhinn shaharon main 15 parisar sthapit kiye hai, jo puri tarah peshewar dhang se chalaae jate hai
 Its parent campus runs 10 full-time and eight evening courses in Delhi

 The faculty here is of a high standard and it has a special global connect with the industry

 It is growing with the help of technology in both content and methodology

 Faculty members and students at the institute are working together on new challenges in the fashion industry
 ''institute essesri dizin, fishan communication, nitvir dizin, ledar dizin, sile-silaae vastra utpaadan or textile dizin jaise vishyon main chaar saal kii degree detaa he

 Under this, students will be taught the necessary skills along with facing all kinds of challenges in the practical world after graduation

 An important aspect of the NIFT courses over the years is that keeping in mind all the international trends, it also teaches to preserve indigenous traditional art through the Craft Cluster Initiative
 craft cluster inishiative chaatro ko bharat kii paramparaon se rou-ba-rou karaata he
 In fact, in 2014-15, a total of 265 students visited craft clusters in various places across the country and during this time they worked with skilled handicraft craftsmen
 yah inishiative chaatro ko apni ankhon se dekhne or anubhav karne kaa mauka detaa he ki asal main kaise kaam hota he or kaise ve is anubhav kaa istemaal apni rosemara kii padhai main kar sakate hai
 This is also evident in the design department's classrooms on the second floor of the NIFT
 inhen kamaron main kadhai, bunai, juki silaai mashin, kapade kaatane kii mej, or drafting kii mej tathaa workstation hai
 In these open and open classrooms with full lighting, the designers of the future work very finely and get their hands dirty
 unhen paathyakram ke mutabik jo kuch banane ko kaha jaataa he, use kaatane, silne or duusari baarikiyaan dene kaa kaam karte hai
 Nayanika Thakur Mehta, Fashion Design Center Coordinator, NIFT Delhi, says, "every student is given a machine to work and we assure that every necessary facility is provided
 pattern bananaa, dreping, silaai-kadhai sab kuch chaatr hi karte hai or in sabhi paimaanon par sakhti se unka akalan kiya jaataa he
 "this special focus of study, discipline and supportive environment makes the institute really like a home outside the home for these future designers
" kisi bhi vakt classroom, work lab yaa canteen or hostel ke kamaron main lagaataar nae idia par khulkar bahes karnaa koi apwaad nahin balki yahaan kii aam baat he
 Pramila Uttam, a final semester student of NIFT Delhi's Fashion Design, says, "the institute has changed a lot in me
 yahaan maine choti se choti baat ko bhi ek alag nazariye se dekhnaa siikhaa
 For example, when i go to a brand shop, i see a stitched garment in my own way
 main use bheetar-baahar donon taraf se dekhati hum
 i notice how the pockets are there, how the stitching is done
 isse mujhe us paridhaan kii quality kaa andaja lag jaataa he
 Similarly, another student from the final semester of Fashion Design, Arnav Vijayvargiya, says, "our understanding, attitude and color have all gone better while studying here
 ham ek vyakti kii tarah ubhare hai, hamaari soch badali he, hamane siikhaa he ki kaise dusron kii madad kii ja sakati he or unase kaisaa taalluk rakhaa jaae jo hamaare jaise hi rachanaatmak or maahir hai
 We are not only able to talk to our senior colleagues, but also to our teachers
 hamaare shikshak sirf paathyakram hi nahin padhaate, balki jindagi jeene kii baaki baaten bhi bataate hai
 This is very valuable for us

 slo fishan main der lagati he, mehnat kaa kaam hota he or aisa nahin hota ki pahano or phenko, balki use pahano or surakshit rakho ke dharre par chalanaa hota he
 "" Earlier fashion education was considered to be employable, given in polytechnics, etc
 lekin ab aisa nahin he

 ' Ayodhya is called the city of Lord Rama
 ye manyata he ki yahaan hanuman ji sadaiv vaas karte hai
 That is why devotees come to Ayodhya and see Lord Hanuman before seeing Lord Rama
 kahaan he ye mandirhanuman gadhi, shri hanuman ke mukhya mandiro main se ek he
 It is near Ayodhya in Sitapur district, 100 km from Lucknow, the capital of Uttar Pradesh
 yahaan hanuman ji kii murti balishtha or laal rang main he
 There is a temple of Maa Brahmacharini in Kashi, every devotee fulfills all wishes, before going to Hanumangarhi, it is recognized that when Lord Rama conquered Lanka and returned to Ayodhya, he gave his favorite devotee Hanuman this place to live
 saath hi yah adhikaar bhi diya ki jo bhi bhakt yahaan darshan ke liye ayodhya aayega, use pehle hanuman kaa darshan-pujan karnaa hoga
 How is this temple? After traveling 76 stairs, devotees see the smallest form of Pawanaputra here
 ye hanuman tila he, jo hanumangadhi ke naam se prasiddh he
 There is a 6 inch statue of Pawanaputra Hanuman, which is always decorated with flowers and garlands
 hanuman chalisa kii chaoupaaiyaan mandir kii deevaaron par sushobhit hai
 Exclusive: This year it is like Baba Barfani, see why PICS is special
 These temples are Dakshin Mukhi Hanuman ji in this temple
 manyata he ki yahaan darshan karne or hanuman ji ko laal chola chadhaane se grah shant ho jate hai, jivan main safalataa or samruddhi milti he
 This is the Siddha Peetha of Hanuman ji
 kashmir main patharbazon ko begunaah bataa kar sena ke major par to exiaar ho jaati he, lekin usee kashmir main us moulana par koi ection nahin hota, jo muslimon se hamadardi ke naam par azaad bharat main nayaa pakistan banane kii baat karata he
 These are the new age Jinnah
 jinka agenda desh kaa ek or bantwaaraa karnaa he
 Kashmir Deputy Grand Mufti Nasirul Islam needs a new Pakistan in independent India
 kasganj hinsa ke bich nasirul islam apana agenda lekar aa gaye, jisamen wo muslimon se hamadardi ke bahaane alag desh kii baat karne lage
 This false sympathy is hidden in the question that the way people like Nasirul Islam walk in Kashmir
 us soch main hi hindustan kii jagah kahaan he
 That thinking runs on the agenda of Pakistan itself, which has been going on for years to cut Hindustan
 lekin alag desh kii baat karne vaale nasirul islam jaisekashmirake moulana pehle khud ko dekh len, unhone apni soch se kashmir kaa kya haal kar rakhaa he
 People like him have always thought of separating from the country
 darasal, kashmir ke dipti mufti ajam naseer ul islam ne bhartiya musalamaanon ko hindustan se alag hone kii baat kahi thi, jiske baad se desh main siyaasi tufaan khadaa ho gaya he
 Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti has also strongly criticized the statement of Islam
 kasganj hinsa kii aad main muslimon se hamadardi kii aad main wo apana agenda chalaayenge or koi ise samaj nahin paaegaa, to ye bahut bade bhram main hai
 The country has seen the pain of a partition in 1947
 ab iske tukade karne kii soch rakhane vaale nae jinna kabhi kaamyaab nahin honge
 This is not India of 1947, but India of 2018
 vaise nasirul islam ko nayaa pakistan banane kii baat kehane kii zarurat hi kya he, unki chahat to pakistan jaakar bhi puri ho sakati he
 Perhaps Nasirul Islam must have seen the world's paradise for Muslims in Pakistan

 a five-year-old girl was allegedly raped by a teenage boy in Kopaganj area of mau district in Uttar Pradesh
 police sutron ne bataaya ki ek mahila ne kal kopaganj thana police ko soochna di thi ki vinod rajbhar (14) ne gat shanivaar ko uski paanch saal kii beti se balaatkaar kiya
 According to sources, Vinod has been arrested and sent to jail
 san 1984-85 main mujhe pehali baar vijaydaan detha kii rachana padhgaye kaa mauka mila tha
 After that i have read almost all his writings
 is chote kad ke mahaan lekhak ne apni anokhi lekhan style se mujhe moh liya tha
 The beaded threads in his story and his vibrant art of telling it would have pulled me away from this urban environment
 main unke kirdaaron ke jariye jhalkati desh kii mitti se unki pahchaan or lok samskruti main gahare baithi buniyaad se kaaphi prabhavit tha
 My mind had gathered several excerpts from this glorious writer to form an Aks, but i got the opportunity to interact with him in 2002 after many years
 unhen pyaar se 'bijji’ bulaayaa jaataa tha
 It is clear to meet them that their roots are strongly connected to their soil and they get strength from the oral tradition of our country, especially Rajasthan
 unhone apni jameen ke mithkon, kinvadantiyon par shodh karne main jivan bitaayaa he
 The most breathtaking thing in his creations is that he has also woven contemporary relevance into our grandmother Amma's stories while retaining the age-old traditional embroidery
 kisi vaicharik dhaanche ke andar koi swaroop banaae bagaiyr ve sansthagat bandhanon se chhutkaaraa or aadhunik / shahari jivan ke virodhabhaason se mukti jaise mulyon kaa prachaar karte hai
 Many of his stories have raised themes that breathe beyond his time
 bijji ne behtareen vyangy kaa istemaal karte hue apni kahaniyon main aae mode ko 'sutaradhar’ ke jariye jataayaa he
 The words of the narrator have been reflecting his own progressive attitude many times
 unhone mahilaon kii durdasha, garib or aam aadmi ke shoshan kii aalochana kii or bataaya ki isaki vajah purush pradhan samaaj he
 He was often seen standing against the rich and the rich on class distinction
 unka dil vanchiton ke liye dhadkta tha
 Nature was the most important in his created world, whose image he used to describe very generously
 main ek saahitiyik aalochak nahin, phir bhi unke prashansak ke rup main main unke kaam ke bare main bina ruke likh saktaa hum
 In 2002, i went to meet with his wife Sandhya Gokhale to get consent to make a film on Bijji's story Dilemma, which i think is one of his best compositions
 hamane unhen saaf bataa diya tha ki ham usee kahani par bani mani kaul kii film kaa 'rimek’ nahin bana rahe
 We shared our thoughts about the story with them and told them that we will make some changes in the original story
 hamane unhen film kii style or usase sambandhit hamaari kalpana ke bare main khulkar bataaya
 It was a pleasant surprise for us that the veteran writer welcomed our approach of adapting Mani's film into a new way, while diverging from the film
 unhone bahut khule man se hamaare vichaar par gaur kiya
 When Sandhya was writing the screenplay of Paheli, Bijji often helped her to get a true portrayal of the essence of this love story
 unhen apane 'guide’ ke rup main paakar doordaraj ilaake kii vah yatra bhi hamaare liye behad dilachasp bani rahi
 The comparative impact of the short stories of Western writers on their own authorship while sitting at a shop in a locality while making 'lassi' and comparatively discussing Elakai literature or eating dal baati-churma surrounded by truck drivers from different parts of the country at a dhaba
 But talking was a wonderful experience
 paheli film ko shuru karne se pehle taiyaar screenple ko bijji ke paas bheja gaya tha
 In the next meeting he gave his response in a very clean manner
 unhone kaha ki unhone paaramparik lokkathaon ko apane nazariye se kaha he, isliye ve sandhya ke nazariye se kahi gai kahani kaa puraa aadar karte hai
 After we returned, she also wrote a very lovely letter to Sandhya in which she appreciated not only the changes made by Sandhya to the original story, but also the feminist interpretation of it
 main jindagi main kai lekhakon se mila hum jo unki tarah vikhyath nahin the, par apni kahani main kisi bhi badlaav ke liye ve kabhi taiyaar nahin hue
 In that respect, Bijji was really different
 kuch saal pehle, bijji ke prakashkon ne mujhase dilli main ek samaaroh main unki mashhoor kahaniyon ke sankalan ko jari karne kaa anurodh kiya
 i agreed, because through this i could publicly express my gratitude to this great storyteller and get a chance to meet him once again
 badakismati se kharaab sehat kii vajah se unhone apana daura radd kar diya or hamen hi apane paas aane kaa nyotaa bhej diya, ''main apane gaanv borunda se baahar nahin nikal saktaa, isliye aap hi hamaare is chote-se gaanv main aaen or is buudhe aadmi ke saath kuch pal bitaayen!”us chote-se sandesh main bijji ne ham donon se dohari jindagi par jaldi se jaldi kaam shuru karne kaa aagrah bhi kiya
 This is another great story coming out of the pen of that great story whose filming rights he gave me, i heard that Vijayadan was no more
 yah behad dukh kii baat he ki agar main celulide par kabhi dohari jindagi pesh kar paaya to use dekhne ke liye bijji hamaare aasapaas nahin honge

 If a girl is not covered from head to foot, it does not mean that she is inviting anyone

 8

 9
 No one will lose weight for the wrong reason
 main khud ko bhookha nahin rakh sakati
 i can't be too thin
 main jo hum, main usase khush hum

 Cricket World Cup semi-finals of Australia and India are to be held in Sydney on Thursday
 kaante kii takkar
 According to the news so far, the pitch is dry
 yani ballebaajon or spinners ke liye madadgaar
 Australian batsmen are in form, just like our batsmen
 tej gendbaaji bhi lagbhag ek jaisi hi paini he
 If we have the edge, then in spin bowling
 jabaki australia ko phayda he gharelu vaataavaran kaa
 But apart from these facts, there are some other things which will help to explain the further view - 1
 1992 ke vishwacap ko mila liya jaae to australia ne australia main vishwacap ke 12 match khele hai, jisamen se teen haare hai
 But this time he once suffered a defeat, that too from New Zealand in New Zealand
 jabaki newjiland ne apane hi desh main ab tak vishwacap ke 17 match khele hai or sirf do haare hai
 That too in the 1992 World Cup from Pakistan
 2
 India has played 10 World Cup matches in Australia so far, in which we lost three times during 1992
 is baar ab tak avijit hai
 But the funny thing is that we have not encountered the hosts on the australia-new Zealand grounds
 3
 Australia is also the most successful team in the World Cup
 usne ab tak kul 81 match khele hai, jisamen se 59 jite hai
 Ie success 74
 37 pratishat
 While India is at number two, having won 46 matches playing 74 matches
 yani 63
 69 percent successful
 newjiland ne 76 match khelkar 46 match jite hai
 And 61 percent of his success
 33 rahaa he
 4
 neutral venue par newjiland ne vishwacap ke 50 main se 20 match haare hai
 While India has lost 16 out of 45 matches
 donon hi timen is maamle main baraabar-baraabar hai
 5
 australia chahega ki semifinal main maujuuda vishwacap champion bharat ko haraakar vah final main jagah pakki kare
 So that he gets a chance to face New Zealand
 darasal, australia or newjiland ke bich hone vaale match main vahaan ke darshakon ke bich bhavanaaen waisi hi hoti hai, jaisi ki yahaan bharat-pakistan match main
 And this time in the group match, New Zealand has beaten Australia by one wicket in a very interesting match
 uski tis bhi use chubh rahi hogi
 And what would be more of a golden opportunity than revenge among domestic audiences in Melbourne
 6
 While India will no doubt face the challenge of sharpening its game without being disrespectful to the pro-australian audience in Sydney
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki pich par spin gendbaajon ko madad milane kii ummid he
 And this is India's strong side
 lay main chal rahe ballebaaj dhawan, viraat, rahane, dhoni or aakraamak najar aa rahe bowler shaami, umesh yadav, mohit sharma or aswin yadi kamaal kar pate hai to bharat kii final main jagah pakki he
 7
 bharat yadi final main pahunchataa he to melbern main gharelu darshakon vaala dabaav nahin rahegaa
 This will be the first time in the tournament that New Zealand will play outside their home country
 jo uske liye sahaj nahin hoga
 For Australia or India in the finals, it will be easy for them to compete against New Zealand
 to agle vishwacap champion kii jhalak to hamen guuruuvaar ko hone vaale semifinal main hi mil jaaegi
 We all know that almond increases memory and this has also been proved in many researches
 par kya aapako pataa he ki baadaam ko doodh main milakar pine se isaki paushtikta or bad jaati he
 Apart from this, drinking almond milk in winter does not make it cold and brings strength in the body
 baadaam vaala kis tarah se bacchon ke liye phydemand he, aaiye jaanate hai
 
 
 Fast-minded doctors and experts believe that eating almonds increases brain power
 aisa isliye he, kyonki baadaam main protein hota he, jo brain fungshan ko behatar banaata he
 Protein not only gives energy, but it also repairs our brain cells
 isaki vajah se hamaare sochane, samajhane or faisle lene kii kshamta badhati he
 In such a situation, if you mix it with milk and drink, then the level of nutritious elements present in it increases even more
 yani agar aap baadaam doodh main milakar bacchon ko pilaati hai to iskaa puraa laabh unhen mil paaegaa
 Roast the almonds in this way, the bones of children will also be strengthened by drinking almond milk
 kyonki is mishran se bacchon ko khub sara vitamin di miltaa he
 Due to vitamin D, bones absorb calcium easily
 baadaam vaala doodh pine se bacchon main arthritis or osteoporosis kaa khatra kam hota he
 Almond figs' anti-halting capacity increases; children in the winter continue to have minor problems like cough and cold
 aise main baadaam vaala doodh unki pratirohak kshamta ko badhayega or unhen is tarah kii pareshaaniyaan nahin hongi
 Saffron almond shake is also beneficial for eyes
 Almond milk has a rich amount of vitamin 'A', which is necessary to keep the eyes healthy
 agar aap apane bachche ko rojaanaa baadaam vaala doodh pilaati hai to unhen ankhon kii samasya hone kii gunjaaish kam ho jaaegi
 Almond Saffron Kheeratwacha also contains Vitamin 'E' in milk containing Healthdibam, which keeps the skin disease free and healthy

 Copy to Clipboard rahul gandhi ke bayaan se ab vah dhundh chant gai he jo unki piem pad kii ummidavaari kii raah ko dhundhala kar dikhaa rahi thi
 It has now become clear that he will take over the reins of the Congress as the PM candidate in 2014
 zaahir he ki mallahviheen si dikh rahi bharat kii is sabase puraani party main ab zosh bhar jayega
 His cadres, who were badly killed in four states, may now have some enthusiasm
 party ke saamne bada prashn yah tha ki aakhir narendra modi kii pradhanmantri pad kii daavedaari ke saamne vah apana koun ummidavaar utaare? ab rahul gandhi ne uhapoh kii is sthiti ko khatm kar diya he
 He will contest the elections as leader of a party full of skepticism and mistrust and will also take command
 lekin ek bada sawaal yah he ki itane samay tak, itane maanamanouvval or itane akraman jhelane ke baad hi vah kyon saamne aae?shaayad aane vaale samay main apni press vaartaon main vah yah spasht karenge yaa ho saktaa he ki chuppi hi saadh jaaen
 However, the responsibility of 2104 lies on his youth and the party is looking battered
 aisa nahin he ki kisi bahari akraman ne party ko itnaa kamazor bana diya
 All this has to be done by the party's masters
 yah baat kisi se chuphi hui nahin he ki upie sarkaar main satta ke do kendra the or aapasi hiton or usase bhi zyada faislon kaa takaraav hota tha
 The files remained stalled and decisions were made to hang the sword of indecision
 piem koi or tha to rajasatta kisi or ke paas thi
 There was a big contradiction
 lekin ab dhundh chant chuki he or rahul vidhivat kaman sanbhaalane ko taiyaar hai
 Along with this, the days of those in the party were also over, which used to play power behind the scenes
 yah sach he ki aage muqabla bahut kathin he lekin yah bhi nahin kaha ja saktaa ki rahul raajnneeti ke nausikhiye khilaadi hai
 He has understood politics and has taken small steps
 bhale hi unhen apaar safalataa haath nahin lagi ho lekin shuruyaat karne laayak anubhav unke paas he
 In the election campaign, he can say that he had talked about purity in politics, he became part of the effort to change the system and made an effort to understand the alphabet of politics by going to the villages and spending the night in the homes of the poor
 baharhaal baaji bich chuki he
 Now it has to be seen how much courage Rahul Gandhi can muster in Congressmen and how he can prove himself to be Ashoka
 (madhurendra prasad sinha varisht patrkaar or hamaare sampadakeey salaahkaar hai) The Central Government had approved the recommendations of the Seventh Pay Commission in June 2016 and in 2017 had prepared for the assembly elections of 5 states
 kendra sarkaar kii manjuuri ke baad ek-ek kar chunaav vaale sabhi rajyon ne bhi apane karmchaariyon ke liye is vetan ayog kii siforeeshon ko manjuuri di or chunavi bigul baja diya

 Although the state government has to present another annual budget before the elections, it could not postpone the benefits of the employees till next year
 aisa isliye ki maujuuda bajet main ghoshnaa karne se use 1 july 2016 se abhi tak kaa arier maujuuda vitt varsh main hi vahan karnaa padegaa
 At the same time, the pressure on payment of employees would be put on the next financial year, due to this, due to which the benefit of pay commission would be given from the date of the financial year of 2017 instead of July 1, 2016
 rajya sarkaar dwaara nae vetanman ko mili manjuuri ke baad sabase nichle str par karmchaariyon 2,520 rupee kaa phayda hoga
 This is about 15 per cent more than the current salary
 maujuuda samay main nichle vetanman main karmchaariyon ko 16,797 rupee miltaa tha jo ab badhkar 19,317 rupee ho jayega
 Along with the existing employees, the state government has also benefited the pensioners
 haalanki kendra sarkaar kii tarah rajya sarkaar bhi bhatte par abhi koi faisla nahin le pai he
 For this, he is awaiting the end of the election process in 5 states and a decision on allowances by the central government
 gauratlab he ki rajya sarkaar ke 4
 50 lakh employees will directly benefit from this decision
 vetan ayog kii siforeeshon se badi selary se rajya sarkaar ke khajaane par 4 hajaar karod rupee kaa atirikt bhaar aayega

 Rahul Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi will hear everyone's talk, said, 'first i was in-charge and party general secretary of Youth Congress and NSUI
 ab main congress party kaa upaadhyaksh hum
 You should not feel that Rahul only talks about youth
 rahul ke parivaar main ab sabhi yani congress, yuva congress or mahila congress hai
 He said in his sentimental speech, "rahul Gandhi will work for everyone from today

 Appealing to the need for leadership for many leaders to focus on leadership development, Rahul said that at least 40 or 50 such leaders should be ready, who can become Prime Minister or Chief Minister if needed
 rahul ne kaha, ‘hamen netritv ke vikaas par dhyaan kendrit karnaa he ki yah kyon nahin ho rahaa he
 It should be done five-seven years before the election that where there is a need for a PM or CM, many people are already present for it
 ’rahul gandhi ne kaha, ‘jaisaa pehle hua karata tha ki nehru, patel or moulana aaazaad jaise darjan bhar netaaon kii jamaat thi or unamem se koi bhi piem ban saktaa tha
 We have to create this thing that 40 to 50 such leaders should be ready who can become PM or CM if needed
 ’ rahul ne kaha ki har jile or har rajya str par aisi baat honi chahie or agar koi puche ki congress kya karti he to ham kah saken ki congress desh ke liye netaa taiyaar karti he
 Leaders who are secular and people related to the people and who understand the problems of the people, need a framework for leadership formation

 Elections are held and he loses and goes back
 rahul gandhi ne kaha, ‘hamaara kaaryakarta upar dekhtaa he or parachute se koi ummidavaar girtaa he
 We have to change this situation and the Congress worker should be respected first
 ’party upaadhyaksh ne kaha ki netaaon kii bhi izzat honi chahie yadi ve janata ke liye kaam karte hai
 We have to make such a system that if a leader is working then he should take it forward and if he is not able to succeed in his work, then interrupt him twice and then give the other one a chance
 unhone kaha ki iske alaava hamaare log hamaare khilaaf nirdaleey ke rup main chunaav main khadey ho jate hai

 Other countries fought independence for violence and weapons but we fought non-violence
 sabane kaha aisa sambhav nahin hoga lekin hamane british hukumat ko ahimsa ke jariye desh se bhaga diya
 Rahul Gandhi said, 'voice was the energy of our freedom struggle
 ham mutthibhar log raajnneetik kshetra par kabja kiye hue hai
 The common people have been kept out of it, while these people do not understand to occupy politics
 aisa isliye he kyonki ham gyaan kii nahin balki pad kii kadra karte hai
 No matter how knowledgeable it is, but it is the value of the post, that's why the game of keeping out the knowledge has been played
 ’rahul ne kaha, ‘sab log ye paakhand dekh rahe hai lekin ye aisa paakhand he, jisamen bhrasht hi bhrashtachar ko khatm karne kii maang karte hai isliye jab tak gyaan kaa sammaan shuru nahin hoga, ye vyavastha nahin badalegi

 He questioned whether it needed a change or not? In response, he himself said that change is necessary, but everyone has to do this work by thinking with them and listening to your voice

 It has to be done very thoughtfully and without haste

 Describing the Congress as a 'very funny organization', Rahul said, 'how does it go, how does it win, how does it eliminate other parties in elections, how does all this happen, no one knows
 ’'congress main hindustan kaa diene'rahul ne kaha ki ye gandhiji kaa sanghathan he or isi main hindustan kaa ‘diene’ he
 The opposition does not understand this
 vipakshi dalon main koi dal ek jati kaa to koi ek dharm kaa lekin congress main har jati, dharm, kshetra or samudaay ke log hai
 There is no caste and communalism in its DNA
 ullekhneey he ki rahul ko shanivaar ko hi upaadhyaksh chunaa gaya he

 The election of Delhi, but the heart of the whole country is beating
 har koi puch rahaa he ki dilli main kya hoga
 Many are beginning to go through the same stress as during the last ten overs during the World Cup
 nakhun chabane lagate hai to ankhen band kar apane kul devataaon kaa jaap karne lagate hai
 Some spectators are sitting where they are left, so that the wicket does not fall on getting up
 yahi haal dilli chunaav ko lekar ho rahaa he
 Television and Twitter have made the election like Dance India Dance and Kaun Banega Crorepati
 jahaan manzil ke nazadik aakar vijeta ko lekar suspence paidaa kiya jaataa he
 a kind of silence prevails whether it will win or not and then shouts that it has won
 mubarak ho
 Do you remember the scene of Kaun Banega Crorepati or the scene of Slumdog Millionaire? aisa hi seen he dilli main
 Just as there is a slog over in cricket, the expose hour is going on in Delhi elections
 har din ke saath nayaa expoze
 With every exposure, the fans of the Aam Aadmi Party and the BJP get sad when they jostle

 Ethics are changing every moment
 copy sawaal puche jane se pehle hi check ho ja rahi he
 What is the issue has disappeared
 jeetna he
 Anything has to be done to win
 jeet sau khun maaf kar detii he

 One gets a scream when downing

 Laugh and cry

 darshak banate hi matadaata kii gopneeyata or niztaa chali jaati he
 He then comes in public
 khud ko phans bataakar apni gopneeyata or niztaa kaa tyaag kar detaa he
 Fans become cheerleaders on Twitter on behalf of their party
 phans loktantr ko tamaasha main badal rahe hai
 The more confidential the voter is, the more difficult it will be to challenge the leaders
 twitor yaa fasebuk kii timeline par jaaiye
 There will be few people who in turn criticize or praise all the party
 sabane apane paale chun liye hai
 Workers sitting for political parties have been found
 phans mat baniye
 You are making the work of political parties easier
 phans banakar aap apni pasand kii party kii aniatikta ko nahin dekhte sirf dusron ko dekhte hai
 You remain a voter

 Middle class is enjoying democracy

 Winning and losing can affect one's number to reach the final

 More than 100 opposition mps led by Congress President Sonia Gandhi today marched from Parliament to Rashtrapati Bhavan against the Land Acquisition Bill
 samaajawaadee party, trinmul congress, bhakpa or makapa samet kareeb 10 raajnneetik dalon ke saansadon or netaaon ne kadi suraksha ke bich nikle virodh march main bhaag liya
 The Congress and other opposition parties are opposing the Land Acquisition Bill as anti-farmer and pro-corporate
 pradarshnakariyon ne sarkaar virdohi naare lagaae or kaha ki jab tak modi sarkaar vidheyak main badlaav nahin karti, unka virodh jari rahegaa
 Controversy also arose on this march
 vipaksh kaa kahana tha ki unhen dilli police se ek patr mila he, jisamen kaha gaya he ki sansad satr ke samay is ilaake main dhara 144 lagi rahati he, isliye koi march nahin ho saktaa
 This was debated in the Rajya Sabha
 sarkaar kii taraf se mukhtaar abbaas nakvi kehete rahe ki vipaksh march nahin kar saktaa
 The opposition said that the President has given them time and it becomes their right that they should visit him
 vipaksh ne sarkaar par 'police raaj' kaa iljaam lagaaya
 Later, the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Delhi Police Commissioner clarified that the mps have the privilege that they can go on foot and will not stop them
 vaise sansad bhawan ke aasapaas kaaphi sankhya main police tainaat hai
 But this controversy has given the opposition another opportunity to attack the government freshly
 is march main congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi samet purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh, echdi devgauda, seetaram yechuri, di raja, dinesh trivedi, ramgopal yadav, kanimoi, premchand gupta or dushyant chautaala shaamil honge
 According to sources, an important role is being played by the Congress on this march, including the finalization of the memorandum which will be handed over to the President by the opposition this evening

 In such a situation it is very important to make sure that we do not eat anything at night that causes bad sleep or any other problem

 Former Supreme Court Judge J
 chelmeshwar ne shuukravaar ko mumbai main kaha ki ucchtam nyaayalay main maamla lambit hone ke baavjood sarkaar ram mandir nirmaan ke liye kanoon bana sakati he
 He said that there have been precedents of legislative process obstructing court decisions
 nyaayamurti chelmeshwar ne yah tippanee aise samay main kii he, jab ayodhya menram mandirnirmaan kaa rasta saaf karne ke liye ek kanoon banane kii maang sangh parivaar main badhati ja rahi he
 Please tell that on Friday also the leader of the Sangh Bhaiyyaji Joshi had said that the Supreme Court should not delay this matter any longer
 bhaiyaji joshi ne kaha tha ki ram sabhi ke hriday main rahete hai par wo prakat hote hai mandiron ke dwaara, ham chaahate hai ki mandir bane, kaam main kuch baadhaaen avashya hai or ham apeksha kar rahe hai ki nyaayalay hindu bhaawanaaon ko samaj kar nirnay degaa
 Let me tell you that while Justice Chelameswar was making this comment, he was attending a discussion session organized by the All India Professionals Congress (AIPC), an organization associated with the Congress party
 gauratlab he ki is saal kii shuruyaat main nyaayamurti chelmeshwar samet supreme court ke chaar senior nyayadhishon ne press conference kar tatkaaleen pradhan nyaayadhish deepak mishra ke kaamkaaj ke taur-tareeke par sawaal uthaae the
 In a discussion session on Friday, when Chelameswar was asked whether Parliament can pass a law for the Ram temple while the case is pending in the Supreme Court, he said that it could happen
 ritred justise chelmeshwar ne kaha, "yah ek pahalu he ki kanoonee taur par yah ho saktaa he (yaa nahin)
 The second is whether it will (or will not) happen
 mujhe kuch aise maamle pataa hai jo pehle ho chuke hai, jinamein vidhaayi prakriya ne ucchtam nyaayalay ke nirnyon main avrodh paidaa kiya tha
 "chelameswar also cited the example of Karnataka Legislative Assembly passing a law to overturn the Supreme Court order on the Cauvery water dispute
 unhone rajasthan, punjab evam haryana ke bich antar-raji jal vivaad se judi aisi hi ek ghatana kaa bhi zikr kiya
 He said, "the country should have taken an open stance on these things long ago
 
 
 
 This (law on Ram temple) is possible, because we did not stop it at that time

 At the same time, Pak Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi can also talk to many other countries (kuwait, South Korea, China, Oman Russia, UAE, Brazil and many other countries) in this regard

 North Korea and Iran are already blacklisted in the FATF

 After Yogi Adityanath became the Chief Minister in Uttar Pradesh, universities, colleges and campuses have started getting saffron
 upi ke vishvavidhyalay main shiksha se zyada dharmik kriyakalpon par dhyaan kendrit kiya ja rahaa he
 In Yogi's reign, religious works like Ramkatha are being treated with great pride in the university
 is kaa baangi vir bahadur singh purvanchal vishvavidhyalay bana he
 Ramkatha at Purvanchal University, Ramkatha Amritvarshaka is being organized at Veer Bahadur Singh Purvanchalak University, Uttar Pradesh's largest educational institution
 uniwarsity campus main 4 oktober se 8 oktober tak ramakatha kii jaaegi
 Acharya Shri Shantanu Maharaj will recite the Ram Katha in this five-day program
 is ramakatha kaa puraa kharch vishvavidhyalay uthaa rahaa he
 That is, at government expense
 vishvavidhyalay kii shriram katha aayojan samiti uniwarsity ke sangoshtee bhawan main is kaarykram kaa aayojan he
 The committee has appealed to all the devotees to join the program
 yogi semiliramakatha kii prerana-visivishvavidhyalay ke kulapati rajaraam yadav ne kaha ki mujhe shuru se hi ramakatha main dilchaspee rahi he
 i have been involved in such programs during my service in Allahabad too
 vishvavidhyalay parisar main ramakatha ke aayojan kii prerana ke bare main kulapati se jab poocha gaya to unhone bade garv se sweekaara or kaha ki pichley dinon lakhanu main yojit visi sammelan ke dauranmukhyamantri yogi adityanathane shiksha sansthaanon main ramakatha ke aayojan kii praasangikta ke bare bataaya tha
 The inspiration for organizing Ramkatha in Purvanchal Vishwa Vidyalaya has been received from the Chief Minister, Vice Chancellor Rajaram readily accepts this
 purvanchal vishvavidhyalay main shiksha kaa girtaa grophmana ja rahaa he ki purvanchal uniwarsity main ramakatha kaa aayojan chaatro ko sanskaar dene ke liye kiya ja rahaa he
 But the question arises that why Ramkatha is organized on the university campus on government money? Purvanchal University's record in education is of low standard
 campus main chal rahe course kaa str lagaataar ghatata ja rahaa
 This is the reason that students studying in the departments of courses running on campus are becoming less
 itnaa hi nahin 350 se zyada sahyogi collejon main bhi shiksha kii haalat behad kharaab he
 Despite this, the university administration is busy in organizing the Ramkatha to improve the standard of education
 dharmik kaaryakramon kii badhbata den ki mukhyamantri ne pichley maheene hi gorakhpur main ramakatha gyaan yajna kaa udghaatan kiya tha
 As Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath himself participates actively in religious programs
 haalanki isse pehle kabhi sunne main nahin aayaa ki purvanchal vishvavidhyalay main paanch divasiy ramakatha kaa aayojan hua ho
 Educational institutions became arena of disputes After the formation of BJP government in UP in 2017, educational institutions of the state have remained an arena of controversies

 India lost the series and number one crown by an innings and an embarrassing defeat of 242 runs in the third Test match at the hands of England
 bharat pichley lagbhag do saal se number ek par kabiz tha, lekin england lagaataar teesraa test match jitkar ab uski jagah isisi test talika main sheersh par kabiz ho gaya
 India had to score 486 runs to avoid an innings defeat, but their team, adorned by well-known batsmen, lost nine wickets before tea rested on the fourth day and were reduced to 244 runs
 england ne lards or naatingham main pehle donon test match bhi bade antar se jite the

 He was also successful in obtaining test rubber from India after ten years

 This is India's third major defeat
 use 1958 main westeindies ne kolkata main pari or 336 ran se jabaki england se 1974 main lords main pari or 285 ran se haar kaa munh dekhnaa padaa tha
 Swing bowler James Anderson left no stone unturned to prove India's strong batting lineup modest
 unhone chaar jabaki stuart broad or greem swaan ne do-do wicket liye
 Anderson sent Virender Sehwag to the pavilion on Friday, while on Saturday morning he opened the defenses of Gautam Gambhir, Rahul Dravid and VVS Laxman
 suresh raina short pich gendon se to batch gayi lekin swaan kii slider ko samajhane main naakaam rahe jabaki mahashatak kaa intjaar kar rahe sachin tendulkar (40) durbhagyapurna tareeke se ran out hue
 India started playing ahead of 35 runs for one wicket in the morning, in which the number of wickets started to increase with the wink of an eye
 anderson ne pehali gend par hi gambhir (14) ko chalata kar diya
 The left-handed batsman played a loose shot on the ball going off the stump without using his footsteps but the ball went to Swann in the second slip with the outside edge of his bat
 gambhir kii tarah dravid bhi apane kal ke score 18 ran main koi ijapha kiye bina pavilion laute
 His dismissal, however, was controversial
 anderson kii jis outswinger par unhen wicket ke peeche kaich out diya gaya, hatspot or snicometer se lag rahaa tha ki vah gend balle ko chhukar nahin gayi thi
 Dravid, however, did not resort to the umpire review system (DRS)
 tendulkar ne anderson par lagataar do khubasurat chauke jade lekin visham paristhitiyon main team ko sankat se ubaarane main maahir vivies lakshmana (2) bhi gambhir jaisi galati karke ayaram gayaram ban gayi
 Anderson again outswinger whom she had gone to before kissing his bat in the gloves before Laxman could understand it
 bharat kaa score chaar wicket par 56 ran ho gaya
 Tendulkar was batting with full confidence
 unhone vishesh rup se us anderson ko apane nishane par rakhaa tha jinhone is star ballebaaj ko apane karier main saat baar out kiya he
 Luck but was not with Tendulkar
 swaan kii gend par dhoni ne street drive lagaaya, tendulkar ran ke liye thodaa aage nikal gayi the
 Before he could put the bat back to the crease, the ball had hit the wickets touching Swan's fingers
 is tarah se egebaston main bhi mahashatak nahin ban paaya or tendulkar kaa shatakon ke shatak kaa intjaar bad gaya
 After lunch, Amit Mishra (22) lost his wicket by playing shot in the air
 dhoni or praveen ne iske baad twanti-20 ke andaaj main ran batore
 The duo shared a 75-run partnership off just 45 balls which ensured that India would not see their worst defeat yet
 swaan in donon ke nishane par rahaa jinhone is bich chaar over main 55 ran diye
 Praveen scored 40 off 18 balls before being caught at mid-off by Stuart Broad's short pitch ball, his career-high score
 unhone paanch chauke or teen chakke lagaaye

 Sports Minister Ajay Maken said that if the International Olympic Committee refuses to remove Dow Chemical from the list of sponsors of the London Olympic Games, the players' role will be crucial in deciding whether India will boycott the Games
 maakan ne kaha ki vah khilaadiyon ke dimag main koi bhram paidaa nahin karnaa chaahate or isliye in khelon kaa bahishkaar karne yaa nahin karne kaa faisla uchit samay aane par kiya jayega
 The Sports Minister said in a TV program, 'there is no confusion in the minds of the players
 agar ham khilaadiyon se salaah mashvira shuru kar den to kya ham bhram paidaa nahin karenge
 The role of the players is very important in this
 ’ He said, 'what the players feel, it will play an important role in our decision
 ham jo faisla karte hai us par iskaa asar padegaa
 Asked what the government would do if the IOC eventually refuses to remove Dow Chemical from its list of sponsors, Maken said, "this is a difficult question, absolutely hypothetical
" hamane ab tak is par faisla nahin kiya he
 ' unhone kaha, ‘hamaare paas yojana he lekin abhi yojana kaa khulaasa kyon karen
 Maken insisted that the government had not yet decided whether Indian officials would boycott the opening and closing ceremonies of the Games
 unhone kaha, ‘hamane ab tak is par faisla nahin kiya he
 i cannot say anything about this
 ham is mudde par bhopal ke logon or saath hi khilaadiyon kii bhaawanaaon ko bhi dhyaan main rakhenge
 The Sports Minister said, "we do not want to choose one of these two
" jahaan tak taiyaariyon kaa sawaal he to hamaari taiyaariyaan joro par chal rahi hai
 We have chosen the best coaches and best places to train
 ’ yah poochne par ki kya bharat khelon kaa bahishkaar karegaa, maakan ne kaha, ‘main is bare main kuch nahin kahana chahta
 i still hope that we will be able to find a solution
 ’ maakan ne kaha ki agar dou ko praayojak ke rup main nahin hataaya gaya to iskaa matlab hoga ki olympic bhaavana par nahin chalaa gaya
 The comments unhone kaha, ‘agar aap olympic charter ko dekho to unhone olympic ke saat moolbhoot siddhant rakhe hai or pehle siddhant main kaha gaya he ki vaishvik moolbhoot naitik siddhanton kaa sammaan
 He said, 'he (IOC) has six classes of activities and one of them is sports and environment
 ve ek aisi company se jud rahe hai jisane union carbide ko kharida or mujhe nahin lagata he ki vah naitik rup se kisi pratiyogita ke praayojan kaa daawa kar sakate hai
 ' jab yah bataaya gaya ki ucchtam nyaayalay main is maamle par samjhauta ho gaya he or bharat sarkaar bhi isse sahamat ho gai thi to bhi maakan ne apana rukh badalane se inkaar kar diya
 He said, 'it is a moral responsibility
 main iske kanoonee paksh par nahin ja rahaa
 When they talk about morality, shouldn't Union Carbide pay its successor company for whatever wrong things they did
 ’ maakan ne kaha, ‘kya yah (maamla) dobra ucchtam nyaayalay ke samaksh nahin he
 It is still a dispute for the government
 aap iske kanoonee paksh par kyon jate ho
 We are telling the IOC under Olympic sentiment that it does not associate with the company behind which Union Carbide has a history
 ’ Maken said that he does not want to create any confusion in the minds of the players and hence the decision to boycott or not to play these games will be taken at the appropriate time
 khel mantri ne ek tivi kaarykram main kaha, ‘khilaadiyon ke dimag main koi bhram nahin he
 If we start consulting players, will we not create confusion
 isamen khilaadiyon kii bhoomika kaaphi ahm he
 ' unhone kaha, ‘khilaadi kya mahasoos karte hai, isaki hamaare faisle main ahm bhoomika hogi
 The decision we make will have an impact on it
 ’ yah poochne par ki tab sarkaar kya karegi agar iosi antat: dou chemical ko praayojakon kii suchi se hataane se inkaar kar degaa, maakan ne kaha, ‘yah mushkil sawaal he, bilkul kaalpanik
 We have not decided on it yet
 ’ He said, 'we have a plan but why disclose the plan right now
 ’ maakan ne jor dekar kaha ki sarkaar ne abhi faisla nahin kiya he ki bhartiya adhikari khelon ke udghaatan or samaapan samaaroh kaa bahishkaar karenge yaa nahin
 He said, 'we have not decided on it yet

 Asked if India would boycott the Games, Maken said, "I don't want to say anything about it

 ’ unhone kaha, ‘unki (iosi) kii gatividhiyon ke chah varg hai or isamen se ek khel or paryaavaran he
 They are joining a company that bought Union Carbide and i don't think they can ethically claim sponsorship of a competition
 ’ Maken refused to change his stand even when it was told that an agreement had been reached on the matter in the Supreme Court and the Government of India had also agreed to it
 unhone kaha, ‘yah naitik jimmedaari he
 i am not going on the legal side of this
 jab ve naitikta kii baat karte hai to kya union carbide ne jo bhi galat chijen kii uske liye uski uttaradhikari company ko bhugtan nahin karnaa chahie
 Maken said, "is this (case) not before the Dobra Supreme Court?" sarkaar ke liye yah ab bhi vivaad he

 JD (U) Rajya Sabha MP Harivansh Narayan Singh will be the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) candidate for Rajya Sabha Deputy Chairman, but the constituency split on its candidature, the Akali Dal has come out in opposition
 jabaki shivasena salaah nahin liye jane se naaraaz he
 Voting for this post will be held on August 9
 vahiin vipaksh main endie ke ummidavaar ko shikast dene ke liye sanyukt pratyaashee utaarne ko lekar charchaa chal rahi he
 On the issue of making Harivansh a candidate for Rajya Sabha, Deputy Speaker, Nitish Kumar said that the issue has been discussed
 vichaar-vimarsh ke baad hi harivansh singh ko rajyasabha upasabhapati pad kaa ummidavaar banane kaa faisla liya gaya he
 However, after the name of the candidate came out from the NDA, there seems to be a split in the alliance
 harivansh kii ummidavaari ke virodh main akali dal saamne aayaa he
 The Akali Dal had hoped that the candidate for the nda's vice-chairman in the state would be from his own party, but this did not happen
 akali dal kii ore se naresh gujral kaa chal rahaa tha, lekin antim samay par bijepi ne jediu ke saansad harivansh ko ummidavaar banane kaa elaan kar diya jisase akali dal main naaraazgi fail gai
 Shiv Sena was also angry
 Now the Akali Dal Parliamentary Party met at the house of Union Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal in which former Deputy Chief Minister of Punjab Sukhbir Singh Badal presided over the meeting
 sutron kii maane to akali dal 9 agast ko rajyasabha ke upasabhapati ke chunaav main gaiyrhaazir bhi ho saktaa he
 Sukhbir Badal has called a meeting of his party's parliamentary party once again on Tuesday morning
 is baithak main party is sambandh main bada faisla le sakati he
 The Shiv Sena is also angry with the Akali Dal
 sutron kii maane to shivasena bhi is baat se naaraaz he ki ummidavaar kii ghoshnaa kiye jane se pehle naa to hamase or naa akali dal se ummidavaari ko lekar koi charchaa nahin kii gai
 If sources are to be believed, the Shiv Sena is also upset that when the name of Akali Dal MP Naresh Gujral was decided as NDA candidate then why was the name of JDU MP Harivansh announced at the last minute
 vipaksh bhi taiyarbataya ja rahaa he ki ucch sadan main bijepi ke paas bahumat na hone ke baavjood party vipaksh ko walkover dene ke mood main nahin he
 Despite this, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) can submit its claim for this post of Rajya Sabha
 vahiin, use rokane ke liye congress baaki vipaksh ke saath milakarsamyukt ummidavaarutaarane kaa man bana rahi he
 However, no picture has yet been clear about who the opposition will nominate as its candidate for the post

 But it is understood that Twitter suspended sfj's account for campaigning against India

 The Indian government has repeatedly demanded the US administration to stop the anti-india protests

 Targeting Baba Ramdev, RJD president Lalu Prasad said that he has not been unwell due to the hunger strike but has become ill due to other reasons like checking the financial transactions of his trusts
 lalu ne kaha ki yadi ramdev raajnneeti main aana chaahate hai to unhen apane dam par aisa karnaa chahie, sangh or bhaajapa ke ishaaron par nahin
 He said that Ramdev is not a yogi or Baba, he is an instructor
 vah biimaar logon kaa upachaar kar rahe the yahaan tak thik he lekin vah aresas or sangh parivaar kii yojana kaa shikaar ho gayi, jinhone ek tarah se unhen barbaad kar diya
 My sympathies are with him
 vah ek garib parivaar se hai
 Lalu said that i want to tell him that the RSS and the Sangh Parivar have pushed him to the brink of ruin
 unhen ab apana anshan todna chahie or anya logon ke liye yoga abhyaas phir se shuru karnaa chahie
 If he wants to get into politics, he can come on his own
 vah sangh or bhaajapa kii chaal main kyon funs rahe hai
 Condemning the police action taken at Ramlila Maidan on Ramdev and his supporters, Lalu also mocked the way the yoga guru left the scene
 lalu ne kaha ki vah ashtaang yoga sikhaane kaa daawa karte hai lekin us raat ko police ke aane ke baad unhone kudan (kudane kaa) yoga kiya
 The monk got scared
 vah mahila kii veshbhusha main kyon bhaage
 On Ramdev's agitation against black money, the RJD leader said that Ramdev is not a new avatar in this fight and the government's investigation will reveal what kind of money has been invested in Ramdev's trust

 He said that the government should not talk to supporters of Anna Hazare or Ramdev but to the mps

 austrailian dak seva ke mukhya kaaryakari adhikari (siio) ahamed fahore ne guuruuvaar ko apane pad se istipha de diya he

 According to Xinhua, Ahmed became the highest-paid public servant in 2016

 The farmer cultivates the crop by working day and night with the dream that his grain will get good price in the market
 jisase vah apane bivi bacchon kaa paalan poshan kar sakegaa
 But due to the apathy of the government, neither the farmers get the price of the crop nor the benefit of any scheme

 In it, a farmer is seen breaking his grown crop with an angry shovel
 daawa kiya ja rahaa he ki video maharashtra kaa he
 In which an alleged farmer is seen talking to the man who is making the video in Marathi

 My vegetables are sold for only 10 and 20 rupees

 Even the carriage fare does not go out

 "when the person making the video says that the government will help you, he says that," Mann ki baat vaan ki nahin nahin nahin ki baat hai sarkaar jhuthe vaade karti he

 Actually, vice-chancellor Rajaram Yadav of Veer Bahadur Singh Purvanchal University of Jaunpur said during a seminar that if there are students of Purvanchal University, then do not get beaten up in a fight, but come beaten and if the bus goes to murder
 gajipur ke satyadev degree college main seminar ko sambodhit karte hue kulapati rajaraam yadav ne kaha, 'yuva chaatr vahi hota he jo parvat kii chattaanon main pair martha he to pani kii dhar nikalati he

 In this election season, the attitude of the leaders towards the public seems to be increasing

 During the election campaign, VIP leaders suddenly go out of the security circle and reach the public, so if anyone's hands and feet swell, then they are the soldiers of the central forces deployed in the security
 in dinon lagbhag roj aisi khabaren saamne aati hai jab congress mahasachiv priyanka gandhi suraksha gheraa tod, berigade laangh kar raily kii bheed main pahunch jaati hai, piem modi logon se haath milte najar aate hai
 In such a situation, it can be a matter of curiosity for anyone that how the Central Forces ensure the safety of VIP people throughout the country during the election campaign? Central forces have thousands of vigilant commando vips to protect the people
 But more than two thousand vigilant commandos, 120 young observer officers, thousands of bullets, first aid kits and intelligence data sheets
 Are

 These vips are some of the well-known vips in the security of the CISF, including RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat (Z Plus), Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Kamal Nath (Z), ministers in the Modi cabinet, Mahesh Sharma and Manoj Sinha, former IPS officers and the BJP
 The candidates include Bharti Ghosh and several other Lok Sabha candidates of the saffron party in Trinamool Congress-ruled state of West Bengal

 Team India will have a real fire test on Sunday against mirpurbangladesh
 mejabaan team jahaan yah match jitkar siries jeetna chaahegi, vahiin team india jeet ke saath siries main vaapasi ke liye sabakuch daanv par laga degi
 After losing 79 runs in the first match of the three-match series, India is in danger of losing the ODI series against Bangladesh for the first time
 iske alaava pehle match main ran lene ke dauraan hue vivaad ke kaaran captain dhoni ko apni 75 pratishat match fees bhi ganvaani padi
 The return of Team India will not be easy, however, the path of India's return will not be easy as Bangladesh has consistently performed well in the last few times
 isisi cricket world cap main team ne antim-aath main jagah banane ke baad mashref murtaja kii aguai main pakistan ko gharelu sarajameen par vanade siries main 3-0 se haraaya tha
 Bangladesh also proved their talent by beating India's strong team in the first ODI
 iske alaava captain dhoni kii form pichley kuch samay se kaaphi acchhee nahin chal rahi or haal ke samay main unki‘captain kool’ kii chhaviko bhi nuksaan pahunchaa he
 Dhoni should consider himself lucky that he was not banned for two matches due to 'level Two' offense for hitting debutant Mustafizur Rahman, who was making his debut, which would have ended the series for him
 dhoni ne apni 75 pratishat match fees ganvaai lekin ab unhen dekhnaa hoga ki unki ballebaaji main kya galat ho rahaa he
 Dhoni has failed to perform effectively in recent times, apart from his innings of 85 runs against a weak Zimbabwe team in the World Cup and a 65-run knock during the semi-final defeat against Australia
 aankaden bataate hai ki 2011 world cap jeet ke baad pichley chaar saal main baayen haath ke spinneron ke khilaaf dhoni kaa strike rate lagbhag 66 tak gir gaya he
 Also, when the left-arm bowler is bowling, Dhoni needs 32 balls to make the boundary and that is why he was struggling against Shakib Al Hasan
 iske alaava dhoni ko sunishchit karnaa hoga ki team ekajute hokar pradarshan kare jisase ki ulatpher kii kisi bhi ashanka ko khatm kiya ja sake
 Meanwhile, there is a possibility of rain again and in such a situation, Team India will be hoping to complete the match so that it can achieve parity in the series
 shikhar dhawan pehle match main naakaam rahe lekin pichley kuch samay main unki form acchhee rahi he or baayen haath kaa yah ballebaaj fatullah main ekmaatr test ke pradarshan ko doharaana chahega jahaan unhone bada shatak lagaaya tha
 Kohli is also capable of playing big innings in the out of form Rohit Sharma ODI and he would not like to be dismissed after coming in a good rhythm like in the first match
 test captain viraat kohli kaa vanade main record shandaar he lekin pichley kuch samay se unki form acchhee nahin he or unhen lay main aane ke liye ek badi pari kii jarurat he
 Ajinkya Rahane can also prove to be dangerous for the opposing team like Dhoni and Kohli on their day and their eyes will be set on getting past the first match failure
 gendbaajon kaa kya karen dhoni?dhoni ke liye haalanki yah sunishchit karnaa sabase ahm hoga ki unke gendbaaj pichley match kii tulana main behatar pradarshan karen
 Especially the fast bowlers against whom Bangladesh's top order scored easily
 umesh yadav pichley kuch samay se lagaataar team kaa hissaa hai lekin iske baavjood unke pradarshan main nirantarata kii kami he
 In the first match, India had to bear the brunt of their poor line and length
 mohit sharma pichley kuch samay se tisare tej gendbaaj ke rup main dhoni kii pasand rahe hai lekin pehle match main paanch over se kam main hi unhone 50 ran se adhik lutaa die the
 Bhuvneshwar Kumar's loss of pace has also increased Dhoni's troubles
 yah tej gendbaaj pehle 130 kimi pratighanta se adhik kii gati se gend phenkata tha jabaki ab vah 125 ke aasapaas kii gati se gendbaaji kar rahaa he
 In such a situation, the burden on the team's main strike bowler Ravichandran Ashwin increases significantly
 aswin or kuch had tak suresh raina kii gendbaaji ke kaaran hi bharat bangladesh ko 307 ran ke score tak rokane main safal ho paaya kyonki ek samay lag rahaa tha ki mejabaan team 350 ran ke aas paas pahonchegi
 Bangladesh has improved a lot as an ODI team in the recent past and has a good mix of young and experienced players

 Of course it is like welcoming the expatriates to arms, but interestingly, all this happened at a time when the World Bank in its recent report ranked the business in India at 142 in order of good to bad
 yani desh main jeevanyaapan ke liye vyavsaay karnaa itnaa bhi aasaan nahin he
 On the other hand, when it comes to business in India, obviously there is no harm to the Marwaris and the tradesman class

 The art of growing green leaves in a dry field is in his DNA

 Nikhil Inamdar's book 'rokra: How Bania Do Business' is an attempt to bring out the Bania and Marwari class business talent as per its name, but regrettably he does not appear to be very successful in it

 Apparently the lack of research makes the book content lighter
 duusari ore, kitaab main prakaashak kii ore se bhi dher sari kamiyaan hai
 These include everything from misspellings (spelling) to grammatical defects that could have been corrected
 yahi nahin inke istemaal ko lekar bhi kai jagah sanshay kii sthiti jaan padati he
 For example, when it is told in the book that the businessman is expanding his business, it seems as if a criminal is spreading his roots
 jabaki desh main kisi bhi insaan ko apane vyavsaay ke vistaar kaa sanvaidhanik adhikaar he
 So it is about business and businessmen in the country, which according to the World Bank report is in worse condition than Singapore and even Pakistan
 khayr, kitaab main radheshyaam agarwal kii kahani kehete hue lekhak unki kushagra buddhi or mehnat kaa jaygaan karte hue bataate hai ki agarwal ne 1960 ke daur main apane pita se vyavsaay shuru karne ke liye 20 hajaar rupee udhaar liye the
 The company that Aggarwal and Goenka started together was named 'kemco', which was later changed to 'emami'
 company shuru hoti he, lekin ek samay ke baad sthiti buree ho jaati he or donon saathi vyavsaay or band karne kaa vichaar karte hai
 Aggarwal and Goenka reach Salah for the advice, 'the patriarch' and then roar in filmy style and the kulpita agrees to shut down the business
 vah ek baar phir tijori se paise laakar donon ko de dete hai, lekin is baar rakam 20 hajaar se badhkar 1 lakh ho jaati he
 That is, there are now two aspiring companions, 1 lakh rupees and the 'baniagiri' of their DNA turns Chemco into Emami
 gaur karne vaali baat yah ki 60 ke dashak main 20 hajaar yaa 1 lakh rupee kaa hona kisi pahaad si jamaa sampatti jaisaa hi he
 That is, the story of 'emami' defies the thinking and culture of the country as well as the origin of the book which says that the tradesman knows how to make profit and it is in their DNA
 to kul milakar 'imami gaatha' kitaab ke shuru hone ke saath hi uske mul kaa vadh kar detii he
 The question is whether this is the way of earning the 'cash' of the tradesman, about whom Nikhil really wanted to tell? Is this the formula through which the business of the tradesman flourishes and flourishes? The authors have, of course, failed to keep up with the title of the book
 khayr, agar vaaki aap is soch ke saath is kitaab ko padhane kii ichha rakhte hai ki isse aapako 'baniyagiri' ke mul kii jaankaree hogi or yah kitaab vyavsaay main laabh kamaane kii bhartiya vyavastha kaa sutara bataa paaegi to maaf kiijie aapako niraashaa haath lagegi

 The initial phase of the election indicates that the support of the Congress and the National Conference in Jammu and Kashmir has decreased considerably
 ye sanket bhi mili hai ki ghati main pidipi ko shandaar jeet milegi, jabaki jammu or sambhawatah ladakh main bhartiya janata party vijeta banakar ubharegi
 Such assessments made during elections are not reliable at all, and as the election campaign continues, the picture will get clearer
 lekin philhal, aisa jaahir ho rahaa he ki chenab nadi rajya main vibhajit janadesh kii rekha ban chuki he, jo hindu-bahul jammu or muslim-bahul kashmir ko alag karti he, or ladakh ek kinare main asahaay-sa khadaa dikhaai detaa he, jabaki ateet main aisa lagata tha, jaise neshnal conference-congress gathbandhan kii maujuudagi puure rajya main he
 The National conference-congress alliance will accept defeat in the same way that they have been winning so far, because such fluctuations occur in the democratic system, but all Indians, including the voters of this state , Should seriously understand the dangers of politically dividing the state on the basis of religion
 mahabuuba mufti ne saaf kar diya he ki unka rajya main bhartiya janata party kii gaadi par savaar hone kaa koi iraadaa nahin he
 She gave an interview to 'the Hindu' newspaper on November 23, saying, "BJP is trying to tell a certain kind of people that it will take Kashmir differently and teach Kashmiris a lesson
 
 
 " unhone yah bhi kaha ki bhartiya janata party kaa iraadaa 'kashmiriyon ke adhikaar chin lene' kaa he, kyonki jab ve anuchhed 370 kii baat karte hai, to uskaa arth rajya ke adhikaar chhinana hi he
 
 
 "mehbooba Mufti also drew attention to the 'communalization' that 'they (BJP) are encouraging
 
 
 ' mahabuuba mufti ne ise 'bahut, bahut khatarnaak khel' bataaya or kaha, yahaan koshish ho rahi he, "pehle jammu ko kashmir ke khilaaf khadaa kiya jaae or phir kashmir ko puure bharat ke khilaaf
 
 
 "the Mufti also condemned the language (loot) of Modi which Modi used while launching his Kashmir r election campaign in Kishtwar
 mahabuuba mufti se asahmat hona mushkil he
 Pakistani interlocutors, especially Niaz Naik, who has been Pakistan's High Commissioner in Delhi, have long been advocating that if the whole of Jammu and Kashmir cannot become a part of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, at least the Valley The merger should be taxed in Pakistan and let Jammu and Ladakh remain in India
 isaki iklauti vajah yah he ki ghati main muslim logon kii bahulata he, jabaki bharat ke niyantran tathaa samprabhutaa vaale rajya ke duusare hisson main aisa nahin he
 We have consistently opposed such mischievous suggestions, defending the integrity of the state, and the integrity of the entire Jammu and Kashmir (including Pakistan-occupied Kashmir) from the Indian Union
 lekin agar is vidhansabha chunaav ke nattejey rajya ko dharm ke aadhaar par rajnatik rup se vibhajit kar dete hai, to ghati main maujuud paak-samarthak tatwon or pakistan kii bhi, ghati ko pakistan se milaane kii maang karne kii himmat badhegi
 Mehbooba Mufti also says, "we will not let this happen
 
 
 " or ham bas ummid kar sakate hai, ki vah sahi hon
 However, the water is becoming muddy, and the reason for this is the attitude of the Bharatiya Janata Party regarding Article 370
 pradhanmantri karyaalay ke hi rajyamantri jitendra singh, jo jammu se hi saansad hai, ne shapath lene ke kuch hi ghante ke bheetar anuchhed 370 ko khatm karne kii baat kahkar joardaar vivaad khadaa kar diya tha, halanki baad main bhartiya janata party kii ore se narmi dikhaate hue kaha gaya ki ve samvidhan ke is anuchhed ko jari rakhane yaa na rakhane ke mudde par aam bahes se zyada kuch nahin chaahate
 
 
 But the debate on this article can also make the situation inside the valley uncomfortable
 nishchit taur par, samvidhan main yah anuchhed asthaayee or taatkaalik hisse main judaa hua he, lekin ise jari rakhane kii mul vajah yah he ki is anuchhed ko lagu karne ke liye jo kaaran - rajya ke ek hisse par pakistan kaa jabaran or gaiyrkanoonee kabza - samvidhan sabha main tatkaaleen kanoon mantri gopalswami aayangar ne bataaya tha, vah aaj bhi praasangik he
 Article 370 can be removed only after the elimination of illegal possession by Pakistan, not before that
 yadi varsh 1972 main hue shimla samjhaute main kii gai pariklpana ke anusaar jammu-kashmir se jude muddon kaa 'antim nipataara' kiya jaataa he, to anuchhed 370 par punarvichaar kii gunjaaish ho sakati he, lekin usase pehle, yah modi kii taraf se gairzimmedaari kii intiha he ki ek taraf to vah kashmir ke logon se sulah kii baat karte hai, or duusari taraf 370 par saarvajanik bahes chhidvakar tanaav paidaa kar dete hai, or vah bhi chunaav ke tanaav-bhare maahaul main
 By the way, to separate Article 370 of the Constitution of the country from the first article of the Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir is historical ignorance (which Modi has often cited)
 jammu-kashmir ke samvidhan kaa pehla anuchhed saaf bataata he ki jammu evam kashmir bhartiya sangh kaa abhinn ang he
 If doubts are raised on the thought of Article 370 without thinking, people inside the valley will also question unity
 isamen ve kashmiri bhi shaamil honge, jo yah maanate hai ki anuchhed 370 hi wo shart thi, jiske chalate jammu evam kashmir ke samvidhan kaa pehla anuchhed bana tha
 Finally, what happened to PV Narasimha Rao's promise in which he talked about unlimited autonomy for Kashmir, which broke the back of terrorism in Kashmir, so what if Article 370 is questioned now
 
 
 ? The reality is that the Bharatiya Janata Party is playing with its own fire
 shyamaprasad mukherjee ke 1953 ke ghati ke daure, jahaan vah biimaar pade or unki mrityu ho gai thi, se pehle hi jansangh or rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ne anuchhed 370 kii vaidhata par sawaal uthaae the
 He now has a government at the Center, and his past stand on Article 370 has now embraced him
 ab na ve apane ateet se peechha chhudaa sakate hai, or na us par bane rah sakate hai, jab dur se hi sahi, rajya main satta tak pahunchnaa sambhav dikh rahaa ho
 The moment they change the stand of their past lightly, they will not only lose all the seats in the valley, they can also lose the Muslim majority seats of Jammu adjacent to Chenab
 so, maujuuda sandarbh main bhale hi modi kaa baaten ghumaane kaa andaaj sukhad he, lekin is maamle main yah sahaj nahin he, kyonki ham bhaashan-kala kii baat nahin kar rahe hai, ham bhartiya sangh kii ekta or akhandta kii baat kar rahe hai
 The change in the long-standing saffron situation regarding Article 370 will only change the thinking of the people inside the valley and only then will the Bharatiya Janata Party's dream of coming to power in the state come true, but Nagpur's Union Headquarters will do so to Modi
 Will not allow nishchit rup se, yah faisla kashmir kii janata ko lenaa he ki ve kise vot dete hai, lekin unhen is baar apane mat kaa istemaal sabase zyada saavdhaanee se karnaa hoga, kyonki agar nattejey se chenab ke idhar-udhar raajnneetik-dharmik vibhaajan hua to isse keval usee hurriyat ko santushti milegi, jiske netaaon ko modi ne pakistan ke ucchayukta se milane se roak diya tha
 The terror and terror of the terrorist organization Islamic State can be gauged from the fact that Yasmin, a 17-year-old Yajidi girl, burnt herself out of the fear of being trapped again in the clutches of these dreaded terrorists
 darasal kuch samay pehle is ladki ko aies ke changul se chhudaaya gaya tha
 It was sexually abused by terrorist fighters
 yah ladki iraq ke sharnaarthi shivi main do saptaah se rah rahi thi
 Suddenly one day he got the illusion that the terrorists had reached the outside of his tent again
 vah khaufjada ho gai or usne unki giraft se bachane ke liye shivi ke bheetar hi khud par gasoline daalkar jala liya
 In fact, she thought that she would become ugly after being burnt and because of this, IS fighters would not rape her again

 ) The girl had been living in a refugee camp in Iraq for two weeks
 achaanak ek din use bhram hua ki aatanki dobaaraa uske tent ke baahar tak pahunch chuke hai
 She was horrified and to avoid their arrest, she burnt herself inside the camp by pouring gasoline
 darasal usne sochaa ki jalane ke baad vah badsoorat ho jaaegi or iske chalate aies ladaake uskaa phir se balaatkaar nahin karenge
 German doctor Kijohan, who worked for the Yazidi girls rescued from the brutality of IS, suffered a severe burn when Yasmin was found in the camp

 ) Pakistan's intelligence agency ISI keeps plotting new conspiracy against India every day
 is baar iesai kii ek or nai chaal kaa khulaasa hua he
 Pakistan is trying to spy on the Sultan Shaheed Post in Pakistan in front of Ferozepur of Punjab by putting very high Pakistani flag on it
 khufia report se is baat kaa khulaasa hua he kipakistanferozepur main seemaa ke us paar antarrashtriya border se mahaj 200 meter kii duuri par 'ganda singh vaala' ilaake main chini ejiniyaron kii madad se kaaphi ooncha flag pole bana rahaa he
 In this pole, he has installed high level surveillance cameras and instruments
 sutron se mili jaankaree ke mutabikiin servilans camaron ke jariye bhartiya suraksha balon par nigaraanee karne or jasusi karne ke liye aise kadam uthaa rahi he
 In fact, Pakistan is very angry at this time and in this rage, it is doing such things that India can be harmed
 international border kii nigaraanee or suraksha karne vaali suraksha agency border security force ne yah puri vistrut jaankaree kendriya grih mantralay ko di he
 Let us tell you that last year, Pakistan on the occasion of its 70th Independence Day (14 August), hoisted the biggest flag of South Asia on the Wagah border
 yah 120 feet lanbaa or 80 feet chaudaa tha
 Recently 400 feet high pole was installed here
 daawa kiya gaya he ki ise puri tarah pakistan main hi taiyaar kiya gaya he
 It is the eighth largest flag in the world, but this time Pakistan is trying to spy on India by placing flags of this manner just 200 meters from the International Border in Ferozepur, Punjab
 bijepi ke varisht netaa laalkrishna adwani kaa 87 saal kii umr main chunaav ladanaa utana mahatvapurn nahin he jitna unka gujarat se na ladanaa
 For the past 16 years, he held the seat of Gandhinagar
 is baar bhi vah us behad surakshit seat se ladane ko icchhuk the lekin ab halaat badal gaye hai, unhen vah seat chhodkar duusari surakshit seat bhopal kii ore kooch karnaa padegaa
 Despite the call of Gujarat BJP leaders, it is not willing to fight there
 dar he bhitarghaat kaa
 In that seat they are not threatened by the Congress nor the Aam Aadmi Party, they are afraid of their own people
 unhen acchhee tarah pataa he ki agar vah is chunaav main haar gaye to unke raajnneetik jivan kaa ant ho jayega, vah jivan jo chah dashakon se bhi lanbaa chal rahaa he
 Advani is credited with building and grooming this party as it is today
 unhone ise ek thos aadhaar diya or usase bhi badhkar use gatisheel banaaya
 On the basis of his visits, he increased the party's reach
 lekin vakt bhi kitna nirmam hota he, jis party ko unhone majboot banaaya, satta ke kareeb pahunchaaya vahaan vah alag-thalag khadey hai
 There are many reasons for this
 jinna kii tarif prakaran main unhen jabardast dhakka laga tha
 His Hinduist image was hurt and he was understood to have made that statement to show himself to be secular
 lekin is baar maamla narendra modi se takaraav kaa rahaa
 Everyone knows that Advani again wanted to contest elections under his leadership
 lekin party aalaa kaman or usase bhi zyada aresas ko yah manjuur nahin tha
 Modi's opposition to him was overwhelming, the culmination of which could be seen as a change in his constituency
 modi unhen chubte hai kyonki unhen lagata he ki unki tamaam mehnat kaa fal modi ko milane ja rahaa he
 Advani is the same politician who once propelled Modi
 lekin raajnneeti beraham hoti he or vah kisi ko nahin bakhshati he
 Today, Advani does not matter much to the party and he himself is responsible for this, his longing to get the post of Prime Minister drove him away from the truth
 vah sirf apane bare main sochate rahe
 Now the situation is that they will have to leave their constituency and contest elections from Bhopal as there was a danger of defeat in Gujarat

 The Daily Times said in its editorial, "making unrealistic claims to get votes and repeating popular jugs has become the norm for politicians

 taliban kii ye sharai adaalat jitani ajeeb he, uske mujarimon par ilzaam bhi utana hi chaunkaanewaala
 These two people, surrounded by Taliban militants, are accused of selling bad meat to villagers
 is adaalat kii ek khaasiyat ye bhi he ki yahaan faisalaa sunaane vaale talibani aatankwaadiyon ne jahaan khud apane chehron par nakaab pahan rakhaa he, vahiin mujarimon kii ankhon par pattee baandhi di he
 That is, terrorists can see everything from behind their mask, but the criminals do not even have the right to see the oppression
 ab adaalat kii karrwai dekhne ke liye puraa gaanv golai bana kar zamin par baith jaataa he
 After this, the people are ordered to listen to the court proceedings carefully, keeping silent
 phir is hukum ke saath hi kandhe par bandook liye ek talibani logon ke bichon-bich aakar khadaa ho jaataa he
 In the open court, the crime of both butchers is first reported
 donon par iljaam ye tha ki inhone jaan-boojh kar ganda or ghatiya gosht gaanv waalon ko bechaa jise kha kar kai log biimaar pad gaye
 And then it is declared punishable under religious rules and laws
 ek aisi sajaa jise sunate hi log apana dil tham lete hai
 The Taliban punished two villagers so severely that even the listeners had to stand up
 in kasaayiyon kaa kasoor bas itnaa tha ki inhone kharaab gosht bech diya
 Both of them were immediately present in the Talibani court and 40-40 flogged on the waist of both the common man
 talibani adaalat apana faisla sunaati he faisla donon kasaayiyon par 40-40 kode barasaane or kode kha kar batch gaye to das-das hajaar rupye jurmaana bharne kaa
 The special thing is that both the butchers brought to the Talibani court were not criminals, but criminals from the first watch
 yani taliban ne unhen sunwaayee se pehle hi kusuuravaar maan liya tha
 Apparently, there was no scope for hearing or cross-examining him in this court
 ek taraf adaalat apana faisla suna rahi thi or duusari taraf taliban ke apane log adalati karrwai kii puri ricarding kar rahe the
 So that later he can present this decision as a Nazir in different areas
 faisla aane ke agle hi pal talibani aatankwaadi ek kasaai ko jameen par patake kar lita dete hai
 Then some Taliban grab all four arms and legs to Babes
 taaki jab jism par kodaa barase to use chatapataane kaa bhi mauka naa mili
 Blindfold of the butchers is still tied
 ab wo aundhe munh leta apni peeth par kode barasane kaa intazaar kar rahaa he
 After this, a Taliban sits near him on his knees and then starts by removing the whip
 ek, do, teen, chaar peeth par padate kode ke har waar se wo dard se bilabilane lagata he, lekin buree tarah jakade hone kii vajah se wo chatapata bhi nahin paata
 Taliban militants liberate him from his clutches after throwing forty lashes one after the other
 iske baad ek doosraa khel shuru hota he
 This time the mask is removed from the same butcher's face and he is made to feel insulted in front of the entire village
 iske baad yahi suluk duusare kasaai ke saath hota he
 Even forty whips are showered on his body
 phir use bhi gaanv waalon ke saamne beizzat kiya jaataa he
 After the completion of the sentence, a fine of ten-ten thousand rupees is charged from both of them and then this brutal court of Taliban ends
 ab gaanv waalon ko apane-apane ghar laut jane kaa hukum sunaaya jaataa he
 With the Tughlaqi decree that when the court comes again, attendance is necessary

 Annadata is once again taking to the streets in Maharashtra
 ol india kisaan sabha ke binar tale kisaan nasik se mumbai tak paidal march nikaalenge
 Farmers are mobilizing at Nashik's Mumbai Naka for this march
 kisaan 27 farvari ko mumbai pahunchenge
 Due to this, strong security arrangements have been made in Mumbai
 kisaanon kaa kahana he kii pichley long march main mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis ne jo aashwaasan die the usamen se ek bhi aashwaasan puraa nahin kiya
 The government was also warned about this by the members of the Kisan Sabha, on 4 February and 17 February, there was a talk with the government but the solution was not resolved
 uske baad kisaan sabha ne long march kaa elaan kar diya he
 Although this long march was going to come out on 21 February, but the police had stopped checking the farmers and their vehicles coming for the long march from place to place
 aisa daawa kisaan sabha kii ore se kiya gaya
 Due to this, farmers were reaching Nashik till late Wednesday
 kisaan sabha kaa maananaa he ki sarkaar ne unhen fansaaya he
 If the police also come, then we will continue to march
 # Maharashtra: Members of All India Kisan Sabha have started their march from Nashik to Mumbai over various demands of farmers and tribals of the state
 pic
 twitter
 com / pfutrhcp92 — ANI (@ANI) February 20, 2019 Meanwhile, the meeting of Girish Mahajan, Minister of Water Resources, Government of Maharashtra and members of the Kisan Sabha took place
 lagbhag 2 ghante chale meeting main se bhi kuch hal nahin niklaa
 Minister Girish Mahajan said that the meeting was good and if we give it to the Kisan Sabha in writing, then people will not need to go on a long march, but there is no solution
 maaloom ho ki march 2018 main nasik se mumbai tak kisaanon kaa vishaal march hua tha
 In this, the farmers had encircled the assembly in Mumbai by walking 180 kilometers on the demand of fair price to the crops, loan waiver, crop insurance, relief to the drought-hit farmers and the distribution of forest land to the tribal people
 us vakt mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis ke aashwaasan ke baad kisaanon kaa march waapas lautaa tha, lekin ab tak sarkaar kaa vaada puraa naa hone ke kaaran 11 maah baad waapas kisaan long march nikaal rahe hai
 There will be 50 thousand farmers involved
 
 
 kisaan sabha kaa daawa he ki shuruyaat main pachaas hajaar kisaan long march main shaamil honge
 By the time they reach Mumbai, this number will be in millions
 is march ke aayojak tathaa kisaan sabha ke dow
 Ajit Navale believes that the government has not fulfilled a single assurance given to the farmers and neither has the debt waiver
 yahaan tak ki kisaanon ko fasal ke uchit daam tak nahin mili
 Nothing happened on the matter of getting forest land for tribal farmers
 fasal beemaa main bhi kisaanon ko naa beemaa kaa phayda mila naa koi raahat
 The government won the game
 
 
 kisaan netaa dow ajit navle ne aage bataaya ki maharashtra ke devsthan ki jameen bhi sarkaar ne kisaanon ke naam nahin kii
 The government only continued to play jumle
 hamane kai adhikariyon se meeting kii
 The last meeting was held 3 days ago with the Chief Minister, but no concrete solution was found
 mukhyamantri aashwaasan se zyada kuch nahin de paa rahe the, isaliye hamane long march nikaalane kaa faisla kiya
 What is the demand of farmers
 
 
 - kisaanon ko karjamaafee mili
 - The farmers should get fair price for the crop
 - fasal beemaa ke tahat beemaa phayda mili
 - Tribals should get the land of forest department
 - poli house kisaanon ko raahat di jaae
 - Devsthan Trust land to farmers
 - maharashtra main pashchim kii ore bahane vaali nadiyon kaa pani maharashtra ke kisaanon ko mili
 - Animals should be made fodder camps or private institutions get grants to start it
 - saath hi suukhaagrast ilaake ke kisaanon ko karj or bijli main raahat di jaae
