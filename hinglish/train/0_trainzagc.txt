 Can you ever think that even unmarried older women in the country are second to none in the body trade
 badi umr kii mahilaon kii taskari kii jaati he or unke khariddaar hota he majdoor varg

 These women are kept completely imprisoned in the houses, even if a woman runs out and complains to the police, then the police do not take her complaint seriously

 Sometimes even when such cases are caught, the police do not register a case against the convicts under the SC-ST Prevention of Atrocities Act 1989, which leaves the convicts easily

 com / p4bds8iriz— Rubina Dilaik (@rubidilaik)september 16, 2018 During the Kumbh in Prayagraj, the construction of the Ram Temple at Ayodhya was announced in the Dharm Sansad
 jyotish peethadhishwar swaroopanand saraswati kii aguwai main 3 din tak chali dharm sansad main kaha gaya ki sadhu sant prayagraj se sidhe ayodhya jaaenge or 21 farvari ko ayodhya main ram mandir ke shilanyas kaa kaarykram hoga
 On the last day of the Dharma Sansad, which took place on 28th, 29th and 30th January, Kumbh Mela has called for a departure from Prayagraj to Ayodhya after Basant Panchami from Hindu society in the supreme ritual passed by Jyotish Peethadhishwar Swami Swaroopanand Saraswati on the last day of the Parliament
 unhone kaha ki agar ayodhya main ekatrit hue logon ko goliyon ko saamana karnaa padegaa to bhi kadam peeche nahin hatenge
 The ordinance issued after the conclusion of the Dharmasandas states, "auspicious of February 21, 2019, for the preservation of the Ishikaika Nyas as stated in the Yajurveda, Krishna Yajurveda and Shatapatha Brahmana to fulfill the wishes of the Hindus in the first phase of the Civil Disobedience Movement
 The Muhurta has been removed
 " dharmadesh ke mutabik, "iske liye yadi hamen goli bhi khaani padi yaa jail bhi janaa pade to uske liye ham taiyaar hai
 If our work was hindered by any of the three organs of power, then in such a situation, the entire Hindu issues a mandate to the public that until the Sri Ram Janmabhoomi dispute is decided or we get the Ram Janmabhoomi, Till then, it will be the duty of every Hindu to take the four presiding deities to Ayodhya and worship the Vedokta Prestika Nyas
 " dharmadesh main kaha gaya he, "nyaaypalika kii sheeghra nirnay kii apeksha dhoomil hote dekh hamane vidhayika se apeksha kii or 27 november, 2018 ko param dharmadesh jari karte hue bharat sarkaar evam bharat kii sansad se anurodh kiya tha ki ve samvidhan ke anuchhed 133 evam 137 main anuchhed 226 (3) ke anusaar ek nai condika ko samvidhan sanshodhan ke madhyam se pravisht kar ucchtam nyaayalay ko chaar saptaah main ram janmabhumi vivaad ke nistaaran ke liye baadhya kare
 "he said," but it is sad to say that the government with an absolute majority in Parliament refused to do anything in relation to Ram Janmabhoomi
 vahiin duusari ore, is sarkaar ne do din main hi sansad ke donon sadanon main aarakshan sambandhit vidheyak paarit karwaakar apane prachand bahumat kaa pradarshan kiya tha
 "at the same time, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, or vhp's Parliament of Religion, is to be held at the Kumbh Mela today
 is dharm sansad kaa agenda ayodhya main ram mandir ke liye sarkaar par dabaav bananaa he
 VHP has been demanding the construction of Ram temple by bringing a law in Parliament for a long time
 viechpi kii is dharm sansad main sangh pramukh mohan bhagwat ke bhi shaamil hone kii ummid he

 The pace of economic reforms may come to a halt in China, the economic reform program that has been going on for the last few years may suffer a major setback

 Along with this, he is also working on a plan to reduce his stake in all government companies
 lekin share bazaar main giravat haaavee hone par jis tarah se china sarkaar bazaar ko saport karne ke liye aage ai he usase saaf he ki aane vaale dinon main china apane sudhaar craryakramon ko kuch samay ke liye darkinar kar saktaa he
 The impact of the China crisis on the banks of America and Europe is concerned about the continuing decline in China because the Chinese economy is connected with the economies of the world

 After the market crashes in China, India may be in select countries where foreign investors can take the initiative to invest money
 kuch jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki china main market krash kaa sidhaa phayda bharat ko pahunch saktaa he
 Due to lower commodity prices in the global market, the margins of Indian companies will increase and soon foreign investors will start to find the Indian market more attractive than China

 Jitendra Singh ji, Minister of State Railways, Mr
 Manoj Sinha ji, Chairman of Railway Board, Mr
 Amarnath Yatra is going on all sides
 bada pavitra maahaul he
 On the other hand, the holy month of Ramadan is going on
 or teesri taraf aaj mata vaishno devi ke charnon main bharat bhar ke uske bhakton ko laane kii suvidha pradaan karne kaa ek mangal prarambh ho rahaa he
 In a way there is an atmosphere of purity on all sides
 main desh ke mata vaishno devi ke charnon main aane vaale karodon bhakton ko shubhakamana detaa hum
 This is not just for Jammu and Kashmir
 na hi ye sirf unhen bhent he
 It is a gift to 125 crore countrymen, who are eager to come here
 maine rail mantri ji ko sujhaayaa tha ki dilli se katra tak kii ye jo vyavastha he, aage chalakar or sthanon se bhi judakar desh ke bhinn bhinn konon se yatriyon ko katra laane kaa jo prabandh ho rahaa he
 This train is known as Shri Shakti Express
 taaki mata vaishno devi ke charnon main ham ja rahe hai, isaki anubhuti yatriyon ko hoti rahe
 i would like to congratulate the Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine Board and the Governor that the management of technology at the railway station here has been well done
 isliye hindustan ke kisi bhi kone se aane vaale yatri ke liye ye sunishchit ho jayega ki uskaa samay kharaab na ho
 Complete arrangements and guidance for the journey ahead
 jab vikaas hota he to kabhi kabhaar aisa lagata he, ki vahaan par ye hua to meraa kya hoga
 Like the Chief Minister mentioned the concern of the people of Jammu
 main anubhav se kah saktaa hum ki vahaan ke vikaas main koi rukaawat nahin aegi
 The one who comes directly to Katra will not accept it without going to Jammu
 jammu kii vikaas yatra or adhik gunvatttapurna banegi
 As soon as the infrastructure is built, the development will start next
 yahaan stesan baad main bana, vyapaariyon ne apni dukaane pehle sajaa leen
 They understand
 ye sirf railway yaa yatra karne kii suvidha nahin he
 In a way, it becomes the mother of development
 mere khyaal se jammu ko rail se jodne kaa atal ji ne jo shubharambh kiya, use hamen aage badhanaa he
 Have to take the track till Banihal
 itnaa hi nahin rajya or centre milakar ek naveen vyavastha ko desh ke itihaas main pehali baar prarambh kar rahe hai
 Hybrid arrangement
 rail or bas kii connactivity kii gai he
 Now those who want to go to Srinagar will also get a bus ticket at the railway station
 or aage kii yatra ke liye banihaal se railway kii bhi tikat milegi or aage srinagar pahonchega
 In future also, as much as the partnership model of the Center and the state will be developed to develop the railway, the more it will benefit
 main mukhyamantri ji kii baat se sahamat hum
 Why do our railway stations look like this from old? kyon na hamaare mahatvapurn railway stesan airport se bhi badhiya kyon na hon
 i assure not only the people of Jammu but also the countrymen
 ham railway ke vikaas main praathamikta metro city or unke railway stesan ko aadhunik bananaa
 The railway station is more convenient than the airport
 yah hamaara sapana he
 It is not difficult and is not financially complex either
 pichley dinon maine railway ke mitron se is bare main vistaar se charchaa kii he
 Soon you will see a change
 isamen privet party bhi shaamil hongi
 How can development become a new force in Jammu and Kashmir in the coming days
 iske liye aaj do mahatvapurn kaarykram hai
 First this rail project
 doosraa
 Inauguration of power project in Uri, which will give development energy to Jammu and Kashmir
 main maanata hum ki hamaare himalay stats kii kai ek samaan kathinaaiyaan hai
 Many are also equal opportunities
 agar unka ek kaaman model viksit kiya jayega to unka samaadhaan jald hoga
 The center will have a clear vision
 rajyon ke paas unnat model honge
 Its benefits will be extended to the states of Jammu and Kashmir as well as the Northeast
 main aaj jab jammu kashmir kii dharti par aayaa hum
 i have come at the feet of Goddess Vaishno Devi
 jab chunaav abhiyaan shuru kiya tab bhi mata kaa aashirwad liya
 i am starting the development journey today, so am doing it with blessings
 mujhe yakeen he ki hamen isse or samarthy milegi
 Tourism has an environment friendly railway with the convenience of passengers
 jammu kashmir main aisa ho to duniya aakarshith hogi
 Through this railway, we are giving emphasis to environmentally friendly traffic
 ham himalayan range main vikaas karne ke dauraan paryaavaran kaa puraa dhyaan rakhenge
 Went to inaugurate the railway station here
 vahaan kaa drishy dekha
 This is rarely seen
 upar pahaad se stesan par jane ko miltaa he
 i immediately said that this can become such a railway station in India, which we can make Solar railway station
 chairman sahab ne kaha ki ham ise turant haath main lenge
 Will present a model for the country
 jab yatri aaenge to unhen prerana milegi
 Jammu Kashmir has gone through many difficulties
 ab har ek kii ichha he ki yah rajya sukhi ho, samrudh bane
 The youth of this place should get employment
 nai jindagi jeene kaa avasar mili
 i asked the children going on the train at Katra station here
 kitnon ne train dekhi
 Boarded the train
 21veen sadi kaa pehla dashak chalaa gaya
 80 percent of those children said
 hamane pehali baar train dekhi
 Sat in it unke liye anand kaa vishay he
 But it is a matter of thinking for us
 ki hamane kaise chalaaya ki inhen itane baras baad avasar mila
 It is our responsibility that those sitting in the far corner should also get the benefit of development
 aakhri chor tak baithe vyakti ko milanaa chaahe
 The development journey that Atal ji has started
 use ham aage badhayenge
 Our motive is not political defeat
 main jammu kashmir ke nagarikon kaa dil jeetna chahta hum
 i want to do it through development
 inhen shabdon ke saath main raashtra ko shrishakthi express samarpit karata hum
 Thanks a lot congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ne bijepi par satta kii khatir samaaj main sampradayikta kaa jehar gholne or mahatma gandhi kii vichaardhaara ko nuksaan pahunchaakar tahas-nahas karne kaa aarope lagaaya
 She was speaking after laying the foundation stone of Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) branch in Kishanganj district of Bihar
 jan sabha ko sambodhit karte huye sonia ne kaha ve mahatma gandhi ke adarsh ko tahas nahas karne par tule hue hai
 He said, 'A frenzied person had tried to undermine the basic beliefs of our country by killing the Father of the Nation, today again these powers are trying to mislead the public
 kursi ke laalach main samaaj main sampradayikta kaa jehar gholkar desh kii puraani ganga-jamuni samskruti ko khandit kar rahe hai or ve aisa karke mahatma gandhi kii vichaardhaara ko nuksaan pahunchane par tule hue hai
 "he does not believe in ganga-jamuni Tehzeeb", Sonia said that this is a period of fighting ideologies and the ideology of Congress is to protect secularism and secular values, which means all religions
 unhone daawa kiya ki congress ne is buniyaad ko hameshaa majboot kiya he or aage bhi kiya jayega
 Taking a dig at the BJP, he said that an ideology belongs to those who have absolutely no faith in our ganges-jumni Tehzeeb
 unka makasad samaaj ko aapas main baantnaa or sampradayik aadhaar par alag karne kaa he
 Sonia said, 'they only need one thing, they have only one thing in front of them, they only need a chair
 kisi bhi keemat par kursi chahie
 Therefore you need to be careful with such sections
 ''bihar ke vikaas ke liye die lakhon-karod'bijepi par nishaanaa sadhate hue sonia ne kaha ki sampradayik shaktiyaan apane lubhaavne bhaashanon ke jariye janata ko bevakoof banane kii har sambhav koshish kar rahe hai
 Amid accusations between Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and Congress leaders over the call for the foundation stone program of AMU branch in Bihar, Sonia said that under the leadership of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, our UPA government has made efforts for the development of Bihar during the last ten years
 One lakh 34 thousand crores has been given
 jamkar kiya centre sarkaar kaa bakhaancongress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ne kaha ki hamane is pradesh kii tarakkee main koi kasar baaki nahin rakhi he
 Referring to the Food Security Act implemented by the Center, he said that 80 crore poor families in the city and villages will get food grains at affordable prices
 sonia ne kaha ki garbhvatee mahilaon or unke bacchon ke liye aspataalon main nae intjaam kiye gaye hai
 Describing the work of the government, he said that a large number of Muslim children have enrolled in schools and madrasas, which has increased the literacy rate of the Muslim community
 unhone kaha ki hamane sachhar cameti kii zyaadaatar siforeeshon ko lagu kiya he or vakf board kii sampatti ke vikaas ke liye ek nigam kii sthapana kii he
 Sonia was accompanied by Union Human Resource Development Minister M
 Pallam Raju, Congress General Secretary and party in-charge of Bihar CP Joshi, State Congress President Ashok Chaudhary and local MP Asrarul Haque
 america ke san francisco main ek hairaan kar dene vaala maamla saamne aayaa jab fasebuk ne Isis Anchalee kaa fasebuk acount disable kar diya
 You must be wondering what is a surprise in deleting the account of Isis
 darasal san francescoki rahane vaali software develper 'isis Anchalee' ke account ko fasebuk ne aatankwaadi sanghathan 'ISIS' kaa acount samaj kar band kar diya
 After this, the woman tweeted on Facebook's Twitter handle that she is not a terrorist but her name is 'isis'
 @facebookwhy would you disable my personal account? MY REAL NAME IS ISIS ANCHALEE / facepalm— Isis Anchalee (@isisanchalee)november 16, 2015unhone apnenaam kii pushti ke liye usne fasebuk ko apane passport kii copy bhi bheji or fasebuk ko khari khoti bhi sunai
 Facebook then resumed his account, apologizing to him
 @facebooki sent you my passport but it's not good enough for validation?— Isis Anchalee (@isisanchalee)november 17, 2015isis ne kaha ki usne apane account ko aneble karaane ke liye fasebuk ko teen baar apni personal detail bheji
 He wrote on Twitter that 'facebook considers me a terrorist, i also sent him a copy of my passport, but perhaps even this proof for Facebook is not enough to enable my account
 'facebook thinks I'm a terrorist
 Apparently sending them a screenshot of my passport is not good enough for them to reopen my account
 — Isis Anchalee (@isisanchalee)november 17, 2015fasebuk ke ekaresearch ne twitor par unako jawaab dete hue unke account ko phir se aneble kiya
 a Facebook spokesperson said that this was an error caused by reporting to the faculty

 After this case, many people named 'isis' have also raised objections

 The comments shastri ne dilip saradesai smriti vyaakhyaan ke dauraan kaha, kaaphi logon ne mujhase poocha ki agar main unki (shrinivasana kii) jagah hota
 So what would he do

 He said, what Srinivasan did (withdrawing from the discharge of responsibilities) is that he has taken up the responsibility of cleaning everything

 unhone kaha, shrinivasana ne jo kiya (jimmedaariyon ke nirvahan se hatana) vah yah he ki unhone sab kuch paak saaf karne kii jimmedaari uthaai he
 Shastri, who was in the IPL Governing Council, called Srinivasan an 'unmatched administrator'
 unhone kaha, shrinivasana asli cricket or khel premi hai, jinhone bisisiai ko kaaphi yogadan diya he
 Hindustan has long been fascinated by its cricketers for the glory and shine of the Games
 magar pichley kuch saalon se duusare khelon se bhi ek ke baad ek nae sitare ubharkar aa rahe hai or iskaa bahut kuch shrey jaataa he pro raceling or pro kabddi sareekhe gharelu lig khelon or mahaj kuchhek kaa naam len to asian games or badminton super siries sareekhee antarrashtriya spardhaon ke sidhe prasaaran ko
 Here are the men and women players, and in one case the 16-year-old Saurabh Chaudhary, who emerged as a sensation in shooting, all of whom are filled with the spirit that has given them great difficulty and obstacles in their chosen sport
 Have seen overcoming ye prerak kahaniyaan mahaj un athleton kii hi nahin hai, jinhone badi spardhaon main apana naam raushan kiya he
 There are dedicated coaches behind every such champion or even people like Rifat Masoodi, the mistress of the Kashmiri Bat Factory, who are as full of passion for the things they have made
 kul milakar ye saare shaks is baat kaa saboot hai ki hindustan ke gaanv or chote shahar pratibha ke urja centre hai, yani aise ingine jo khel shakti ke taur par desh ko apane kad or haisiyat se oonche uthakar prahaar karne kii takat dete hai

 SP Supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav also directly asked the Congress to tell the government how much money it has paid for its support
 There was a lot of ruckus in the house on this
 sansad ke donon sadan kii kaarywahi espi, diemke or ediemke ke sadasyon dwaara hangaamaa karne ke kaaran pehle dopaher tak ke liye sthagit kii gai
 SP members in the Lok Sabha demanded his resignation after Beni Prasad's alleged remarks against party president Mulayam Singh Yadav

 Lok Sabha Speaker Meira Kumar adjourned the proceedings till noon due to uproar on these issues

 When the Lok Sabha resumed in the afternoon, SP members reiterated their demand for Verma's resignation

 Lok Sabha Deputy Speaker Karia Munda then proceeded to the house again 12

 In the Rajya Sabha too, the leaders of all the three parties created a ruckus in front of the Chairman
 peethasin adhikari renuka choudhary ne kaarywahi do baje tak ke liye sthagit kar di
 What is the whole matter? Significantly, the whole controversy started with Beni Prasad Verma's statement that he said that Mulayam Singh Yadav is a goon and he has links with terrorists
 baad main unhone sansad main apane bayaan ko doharaaya, jis par kaaphi ho-hallaa machaa
 On Tuesday, SP leader Ram Gopal Yadav said that we have benefited from Beni Prasad being the minister

 ) Congress Delhi President Ajay Maken has said that the BJP government at the Center and the Aam Aadmi Party's Delhi government have collusion
 isliye grih mantralay ne dilli sarkaar dwaara niyukt kiye gaye keval 9 salaahkaaron ko hataaya he, jabaki shungalu cameti kii report ne dilli sarkaar dwaara aap party ke 71 samarthakon kii niyukti main aniyamitataayen pai gai thi
 Maken said that the AAP party wants Raghav Chadha and Atishi Marlina to contest the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 isliye unako grih mantralay ke dwaara hatwaya gaya, taaki unako chunaav main logon kii sahanubhuti mil sake
 Ajay Maken said that the report of the Shunglu Committee was submitted to the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi on 28 November 2016, but why did the Home Ministry take so much time to act on the report of the Shunglu Committee? This is a question of lakhs
 jabase rahul gandhi congress ke adhyaksh bane hai, tab se congress kaa graph badi teji se upar bad rahaa he jiske kaaran bhaajapa buree tarah se bhaybheet he
 Ajay Maken said that the Central Government of BJP and the Aam Aadmi Party's Delhi Government's connivance are behind the cancellation of the appointments of 9 advisors of the Delhi government, as the Shunglu Committee gave its report to the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi on 28 November 2016
 , In which irregularities were found in 71 appointments made by the Delhi government of the Aam Aadmi Party, while the government removed only 9 selected advisors
 It is because Raghav wants to contest the Lok Sabha elections in 2019 by giving public sympathy to people like Chadha and Atishi Marlina
 maakan ne kaha ki bade hi aashcharya kii baat haishungalu camet apni report 28 navambar 2016 ko dilli ke uparajyapal ko de di thi or 9 salaahkaaron ko hataane kaa aadesh april 2018 main arthath itani der baad kyon diya gaya
 What is their intention behind this, it becomes clear
 maakan ne atishi merlina kaa udhaaharan dete hue kaha ki unako pratimah ek rupee ke vetan par upmukhyamantri kaa salaahkaar niyukt kiya gaya tha, jabaki raghav chaddha ko vitamantri kaa salaahkaar niyukt kiya gaya tha, jiske bare main shungalu cameti ne apni report main close chapter likhaa tha, kyonki unki niyukti keval dhai maheene ke liye hui thi
 Maken said that when Raghav was appointed for only two and a half months, why was he removed along with 9 advisors
 iske peeche aap party or bhaajapa kii manshaa saaf najar aati he ki donon mili hue hai
 Why are BJP leaders eyeing two world records of yoga with representatives from 84 countries and more than 35,000 participants looking for Vice President Hamid Ansari? Is it because they are Muslims and it is their duty to prove their patriotism by doing yoga? sava arab desh main karodon logon ne yoga nahin kiya
 They are not all traitors
 or jin hazaron logon ne yoga kiya, unamem se kai apni harqaton se deshbhakt kahalaane laayak nahin hai
 That is, yoga is not the scale by which one's patriotism is measured
 kaayade se kisi kii deshbhakti maapne kaa koi paimaana hona bhi nahin chahie
 We love the country, because the country consists of the state, the city, and the house where we live
 usase hamaara ek judaav hota he
 But if someone asks us to prove that we love our home, our country every day, then someone sets the criteria for our smooth engagement, then suddenly, either home or the country - both start feeling defeated
 lekin koi hamase yah sabit karne ko kyon kahegaa? kyonki vah hamen paraayaa maanata he
 This is the case of Ram Madhav and Hamid Ansari
 ram madhav jis vaicharik prashikshan main paley bade hai, jise ve apni raajnneeti or samskruti bataate hai, vah hinduon ke alaava kisi or ko hindustan kaa bashinda nahin maanati
 This single vision also forgets that Hindustan has not only made Hindustan, but also a noun like Hindu has not been in any ancient culture, Hindustan on the chalk of many rivers, lots of tongues, lots of traditions, lots of mess
 Has been coined and is still being coined
 deshon kii koi jad murti nahin hoti, ve ek dhadkate hue samaaj se banate hai, ve baar-baar badalte hai or phir bhi hamaare bheetar bane rahete hai
 But the Sangh Parivar does not lose sight of the country's history, is irritated by the present and imagines a future in which only one religion rules
 aise ek dharm par aadhaarit rajya kitne dakiyanoos or krur hote hai, iske udhaaharan hamaare aasapaas bikhare pade hai
 The comments acchhee baat yah he ki hamaara loktantr sangh parivaar ke is vaicharik ikharepan ko kaarij karata he
 He forces the BJP to come to power, marginalize his ideology and take everyone along
 is majaburi main bijepi sabko saath lene kii baat karti he, lekin phir sab par yoga thopati he or khoj-khoj kar dekhati he ki kisne yoga nahin kiya
 If he is a Muslim, his patriotism is questioned
 lekin agar loktantr par hamaara yaqiin he to der-saber jitne imtihaan is desh kaa musalmaan de rahaa he, utane hi bijepi ko dene honge
 Either it will change, otherwise people will change it
 kyonki itihaas bataata he ki is desh main vahi tikaa or vahi bada mana gaya, jisane sabko saath liya, jisane sabko saadh liya
 The rest are remembered as single and tyrannical rulers
 ye bijepi ko tay karnaa he ki wo hamid ansaari kaa imtihaan legi yaa khud insaaniyat kaa imtihaan degi
 Crores of people did not do yoga in 1
25 billion countries
 ve sab deshadrohi nahin hai
 And of the thousands who did yoga, many of them do not deserve to be called patriots by their actions
 yani yoga vah paimaana nahin he jisase kisi kii deshbhakti maapi jaae
 Ideally, there should be no measure to measure one's patriotism
 ham desh se pyaar karte hai, kyonki desh main vah rajya, vah shahar or vah ghar hota he, jahaan ham rahete hai
 We have a connection with that
 lekin agar rose koi hamen yah sabit karne ko kahe ki ham apane ghar se, apane mulk se pyaar karte hai, koi rose hamaare sahaj judaav ke liye kasautiyaan banaae to achaanak ghar ho yaa mulk- donon paraye lagane lagate hai
 But why would anyone ask us to prove it? Because he considers us alien
 ram madhav or hamid ansaari ke maamle kii gutthi yahi he
 The ideological training that Ram Madhav grew up in, which he describes as his politics and culture, does not consider anyone other than Hindus to be a resident of India
 ye ikhari drushti yah bhi bhul jaati he ki hindustan ko hinduon ne hi nahin banaaya he, balki hindu jaisi sangya bhi kisi pracheen samskruti main nahin rahi he, hindustan bahut sari nadiyon, bahut sari zubaanon, bahut sari paramparaon, bahut saare jhanjhawaton kii chaak par gadha gaya he or ab bhi gadha ja rahaa he
 Countries have no idol, they are made from a beating society, they change again and again and still remain within us
 lekin sangh parivaar desh ke itihaas se aankh nahin milaataa, vartmaan se chidhata he or ek aise bhavishya kii kalpana karata he, jisamen sirf ek dharm kaa raaj ho
 Examples of how obscene and cruel a state is based on such a religion are scattered around us
 tippaniyan The good thing is that our democracy rejects this ideological unity of the Sangh Parivar
 vah bijepi ko majaboor karata he ki satta main aana he to apni vichaardhaara ko haashie par daale or sabko saath lekar chale
 In this compulsion, BJP talks about taking everyone along, but then imposes yoga on everyone and searches and see who did not do yoga
 agar vah musalmaan he to uski deshbhakti par sawalia nishaan he
 But if we have faith in democracy, then the BJP will have to give as much of the test that Muslims of this country are giving
 yaa to wo badalegi, nahin to log use badal daalenge
 Because history tells that in this country it was considered the same and the same elder, who took everyone along, who took everyone
 baaki ikhare or atyaachaari shaskaon kii tarah yaad kiye jate hai
 It is for the BJP to decide whether it will test Hamid Ansari or will test himself
 lekin agar rose koi hamen yah sabit karne ko kahe ki ham apane ghar se, apane mulk se pyaar karte hai, koi rose hamaare sahaj judaav ke liye kasautiyaan banaae to achaanak ghar ho yaa mulk- donon paraye lagane lagate hai

 ram madhav or hamid ansaari ke maamle kii gutthi yahi he
 The ideological training that Ram Madhav grew up in, which he describes as his politics and culture, does not consider anyone other than Hindus to be a resident of India

 Countries have no idol, they are made from a beating society, they change again and again and still remain within us
 lekin sangh parivaar desh ke itihaas se aankh nahin milaataa, vartmaan se chidhata he or ek aise bhavishya kii kalpana karata he, jisamen sirf ek dharm kaa raaj ho
 Examples of how obscene and cruel a state is based on such a religion are scattered around us
 tippaniyan The good thing is that our democracy rejects this ideological unity of the Sangh Parivar

 But if we have faith in democracy, then the BJP will have to give as much of the test that Muslims of this country are giving
 yaa to wo badalegi, nahin to log use badal daalenge
 Because history tells that in this country it was considered the same and the same elder, who took everyone along, who took everyone

 aam chunaav kii tazaa khabaron se apadet rahane ke liesbscribakaren ajtak kaa ellection special newzlator The story of 119 children who were brought to Jharkhand after being freed from the orphanage in Ernakulam district of Kerala seems to have a new twist
 ab adhikari bhi yah maanane lage hai ki itani badi sankhya main bacchon ke baahar jane main sthaneey or prashasnic str par chook hui he
 a strong gang is working behind the scenes in this entire incident
 vaise yah koi akeli ghatana nahin he
 Actually, minors have been sent out from the remote and rural areas of Jharkhand by luring and seducing them
 lekin is baar kii ghatana isliye bhi kaaphi sangeen he kyonki saare bachche teen se 12 saal ke umr ke hai jinamein aadhe se adhik ladkiyaan hai
 It is also being told that they were to be sent to Gulf countries also
 maamle kii gambhirtha ko dekhte hue mukhyamantri hemanth sorain ne esaiti jaanch ke aadesh die hai
 Out of 119 children released from the orphanage, 44 are boys and 75 are girls
 ye bachche maanav taskaron ke shikaar banate-banate rah gaye
 The question arises as to why the administration did not lose sight of such large number of children going out
 vaise adhikari bhi maanate hai ki is puri ghatana ke peeche ek racket kaam kar rahaa he
 Deputy Commissioner of Deoghar Amit Kumar says that all the children are from Godda district
 podaiyahat (godda) kii sidipio khalida farjaana kahati hai, 'yah bahut badi chook he
 Will have to see where there has been a lapse at the ground level
 bataaya jaataa he ki in bacchon ko do rigerv bogiyon main jasidih se ernakulam ke anathalay le jaaya gaya tha
 The question also arises that when these days there is so much hit for train tickets, then how two whole bogies were reserved for these children
 siem hemanth sorain kehete hai, 'sachaai kaa pataa lagane ke liye vishesh jaanch dal kaa gathan kiya gaya he
 It is alleged that this gang of human traffickers also includes people allegedly associated with police and administration
 vaise is maamle main sach ghatana kii gahan jaanch ke baad hi saamne aa sakegaa
 But the fearless manner in which the people associated with this racket have carried out this whole incident, it is proved that the elders are behind all this
 rajya main bacchon kii taskari ke hajaaron maamle darj hai
 These include buying them at the cost of animals by luring parents or taking advantage of their poverty
 kuch khuskismat the jo unki changul se chhot gaye lekin adhiktar ab bhi gumshuda hai
 There are many such cases which have not reached the police
 aise main pakke taur par in bacchon kii sankhya bataa paanaa kaaphi mushkil he

 khandpeeth ne kaha ki is maamle main, ‘100 karod se kam kii raashi ke muaavje ke bina (kanoon kaa) dar paidaa nahin hoga
 However, the court refused to close that prison and set aside the 2010 Madras High Court order to close it
 nyaayalay ne kaha ki muaavja kaa ‘dar hona chahie’ or isaki raashi company kii bhugtan kshamta dekh kar tay kii jaani chahie
 The bench said that in this case, without compensation of less than Rs 100 crore (without law), fear would not arise

 The order of the Ministry of Finance clearly states that the employees working in the quasi government organizations, autonomous organizations, statutory bodies, etc
 established and financed or controlled by the Central Government are not Central Government employees and, therefore, in relation to the Central Government employees The benefits implemented by the central government as part of the service conditions are such autonomous terms
 Directly do not apply to workers employed in formations
 is aadesh main kaha gaya he ki swytt sanghathanon se apane kaary is prakaar vyavasthit karne kii ummid kii jaati he ki atirikt vittiya bhaar ko puraa karne ke liye vittiya sahaayta hetu centre sarkaar par unki nirbharta nunatam ho or is tarah swytt sanghathanon se ummid kii jaati he ki ve vittiya rup se aatmanirbhar bane taaki kendriya rajkosh par koi atirikt bhaar na pade

 sarkaar ne yah bhi saaf kiya he ki sanshodhit vetan sanrachana un karmchaariyon ke li sweekaarya hogi jo vartmaan niyamon ke anusaar iskaa chayan karenge
 Director Amar Nath Singh in the Ministry of Finance has made it clear in his leaflet that the Central Government has not yet taken any decision in respect of various allowances based on the recommendation of the Seventh Pay Commission in respect of Central Government employees and hence, the next orders

 This order states that autonomous organizations are expected to organize their tasks in such a way that their dependence on the central government for financial support to meet the additional financial burden is minimized and thus autonomous organizations are expected to That they become financially independent so that the central treasury does not bear any additional burden
 vittamantralay ke aadesh main uparokt di gai prishthbhumi main saatven vetan ayog kii siforeeshon ko swytt sanghathanon ke liye sweekaar kiya gaya he
 The government has also made it clear that the revised pay structure will be acceptable to the employees who will choose it as per the current rules

After Shashank Manohar became the President of BCCI, the Pakistan Cricket Board also has little hope of starting cricket between the two teams
 vaise har haal main ye faisla donon sarkaron ke rishton par hi nirbhar karegaa ki donon tiimon ke bich cricket kaise, kab or kahaan shuru hogi? By the way, many officials of the Indian Cricket Association have taken the stand so far regarding the cricket series between the two countries, it will not be easy to argue about why the series is so

 The decision to have action on the cricket field between the two teams will surely be in the corridors of politics, because khel or raajnneeti ko alag rakhane kii baat kai exparts sahi nahin maanate

 i am delighted that state-of-the-art Skywalk at ITO will be inaugurated tomorrow to provide a safe & world-class walkway to citizens of Delhi

 desh main notebandi lagu hue ek maheene se zyada samay bich chukaa he
 The long queues outside the bank and ATM during this one month are making a disturbing statement
 lekin iskaa ek doosraa paksh bhi he jise desh or duniya ke tamaam arthshaastri maan rahe hai
 BRICS Bank chief and former Indian banker KV Kamath has claimed that the country's government, economy and the common man are also going to have big benefits in the long term
 jaaniye kya hanotbandike 10 phaayde jo tay hai-1
 The banned currency of 500 and 1000 rupees in corruption was 85% of the total currency
 yah donon karency desh main bhrashtachar kii poshak bhi thi
 The use of this currency for corruption has stopped since the demonetization decision
 vahiin jari hui nai karency ko sarkaar dhire-dhire sanchalit kar rahi he jisase kaledhan ke rup main ise ekatra na kiya ja sake
 2
 cashles iconomicash iconomi banane ke liye jaruri he ki desh main zyada se zyada tranjaction digital madhyamon se kiya jaae
 This will reduce the country's dependence on currency and the central government along with the Reserve Bank and other banks will have to spend less in currency operations
 cashles iconomi kaa phayda sarkaar ke revenue main ijaphe ke saath-saath aam aadmi ko bhi hoga kyonki uskaa paisa digital aadan-pradaan main zyada surakshit rahegaa
 3
 nakli karency par lagaamdesh main seemapar se nakli karency ke pravaah kii gambhir samasya thi
 The fake currency that reached his hands had to suffer immediate loss of such value
 vahiin sarkaar ko bhi iske rokthaam ke liye bade network kaa sahaara lenaa padataa tha
 The use of currency (digital payment) and large denominations has cleared the fake currency from the country in one stroke
 vahiin nai karency ke suraksha maanak zyada pukhta hone ke kaaran agle kai varshon tak arthvyavastha nakli karency se surakshit rahegi

 real estate sector hoga paardarsheenotbandi ke baad sabase bada phayda real estate sector main hoga
 For many decades, the real estate sector was the biggest source of investment for black money
 iske chalate kaagajon par property kii kharid or vaastavik kharid main bada antar hona aam baat thi
 Due to this, the government had a big loss in stamp duty, while the common man had to face difficulties in buying houses due to not having black money
 5
 After black money ban, the work of bringing social change against black money in the country can be done easily
 yah hakeekat he ki kisi bhi arthvyavastha se kalaadhan tab tak nahin khatm kiya ja saktaa jab tak saamaajik str par iskaa bahishkaar na hone lage
 Until now, black money was invested in property and gold and silver, so that their value was always higher than the actual price
 ab notebandi ke baad in kshetron main kaledhan ke istemaal par ankush lagegaa
 6
 band hogi samanaantar iconomicaledhan or bhrashtachar kaa sahaara lekar desh main hameshaa se ek samanaantar iconomi chalati thi
 In the country, from coal mining to roadside tea and vegetable vendors, they were involved in this parallel economy
 yahaan zyaadaatar log desh kii sakal gharelu aay ko nuksaan pahunchaate hue apni aarthik gatividhiyon ko chalaate the
 Now, with the trend towards digital payments and black money ending in demonetisation, it will be easy to add this parallel economy to the mainstream
 7
 The biggest advantage of promoting digital payments in the tax base will be that the transactions will be recorded with banks, big and small
 in tranjaction par inakam tex vibhaag kii bhi lagaataar najar rahegi
 When there is no basis for black economy in the country, then obviously more and more people will be able to fulfill their horse-trading only after paying tax
 isse kendra sarkaar kii revenue main teji se oochaal dekhne ko milegaa, uskaa vittiya ghaataa kam hoga or desh ke infrastracchar ko sudhaarney ke liye uske paas paryaapt sansaadhan rahenge
 8
 financial seaving main hoga ijaphanotbandi ke pehle tak desh main log apni seaving ko property, sona or jewelery main nivesh karte the
 When needed, people sold it in the blackmarket and converted it into currency once again
 maujuuda samay main desh ke 50 fisadi se adhik parivaar apni sevings ko inhen tareekon se rakhte hai
 Most of the money invested here is blackmoney
 ab notebandi ke baad real estate or sona apeksha ke mutabik ritern nahin den paaenge, jisase logon ko apni sevings ko rakhane ke liye ek baar phir bainkon kaa rukh kar seaving bank, demand draft or mutual fund jaise vikalpon kaa sahaara lenaa hoga jahaan unhen nivesh par sabase adhik or sabase surakshit ritern milegaa

 badhengi bainkon kii kamainotbandi se kaledhan par lagaam ke saath-saath teji se badhate digital pement se ab bainkon kii kamai main bada ijapha dekhne ko milegaa
 This increase will be used by the bank to expand itself as well as to lure customers
 vahiin notebandi se bainkon ke paas ekatrit hui daulat se unhen apana purana ghaataa paatane main bhi madad milegi
 10 will be cheaper Since the benefits of Curzonotbandi, the benefit to the banks is going to have a direct impact on the interest rates in the country
 vittiya jagat main paardarshita ke saath-saath bank apana kaarobaar failaane ke liye zyada se zyada karj dene kii koshish karenge
 At the same time, to lure customers, he can announce a big cut in the interest rates on the loan
 isse desh main ghar kharidne, car yaa scooter kharidne athwa kaarobaar ke liye karj saste daron main milanaa shuru ho jaaenge

 When so many people worry about running a house, then how can i separate from that worry

 You would not like to see my children on the street

 i love the road main sadak par aakar bhi sawaal karata rahoonga
 On coming to Champaran, Bapu gave the example of how big the power is, no matter how unknown the place, one can stand before him with moral force

 i do not speak the truth to scare anyone
 baapu kehete the ki jis sach main ahankaar aa jaae wo sach nahin rah jaataa
 i speak to make myself more humble and atone for the contradictions within me
 jab main bol nahin paata, likh nahin paata, tab us sach ko lekar jujhataa rahata hum
 In the struggle to be free from all my weaknesses, i say the thing that people hear and say that you do not fear the government
 mujhe apni kamazoriyon se dar lagata he
 i speak only to fight my weaknesses
 likhata hum
 Lose many times tab khud ko yahi dilasa detaa ki is baar fail ho gaya, agali baar paas hone kii koshish karuunga

 People of India have given you infinite love, if there is any shortage, then you can ask for it, it will give you happiness
 magar yah shobhaa nahin detaa ki bharat ke pradhanmantri aise logon ko follow karen, jo aalochakon ke jivit hone par dukh jataata ho
 Since today altnews
 in par padhaa he ki 'uun dharm rakshati rakshit:' naam ke whotsap group main jo log mujhe kuch maheenon se bhaddi gaaliyaan de rahe the, dhamkee de rahe the, sampradayik baaten kar rahe the, mujh jaise sarvocch deshbhakt va duusare patrakaron ko aatankwaadi bataa rahe the, unamem se kuch ko aap twitor par follow karte hai, main saham gaya hum
 Mr
 Prime Minister, if i read the levelless language used by me and some journalists in this whatsapp group, then the listeners will close their ears
 meraa daayitv banataa he ki main apni sakht aalochanaon main bhi aapkaa lihaaz karun
 The language used in honor of women journalists is shameful
 soshal media par aapke prati bhi abhadra bhashaa kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 Which i really regret
 lekin yahaan maamla aapaki taraf se aise logon kaa he, jo mujhe jaise akele patrkaar ko dhamkiyaan dete rahe hai
 Whenever i tried to break away from this whatsapp group, the catch was running, running, hitting it, using the type language and adding it back
 raajnneeti ne soshal media or sadak par jo yah bheed taiyaar kii he, ek din samaaj ke liye, khaaskar mahilaon ke liye badi chunauti ban jaaegi
 Their abuses are anti-women
 itani sampradayik hoti hai ki aap to bilkul bardaasht na karen
 He wants to eradicate communalism from India by 2022 anyway
 15 agast ke aapke bhaashan kaa bhi in par prabhaav nahin padaa or ve haal haal tak mujhe dhamkiyaan dete rahe hai
 Now i have a question for you
 kya aap vaaqai niraj dave or nikhil dadhich ko pholo karte hai? kyon karte hai? kuch din pehle maine inke whotsap group kaa kuch screen shot apane fasebuk pej @ravishkapage par zaahir kar diya tha
 altnews
 in ke pratik sinha or neelesh purohit kii padtaal bataati he ki group kaa sadsy niraj dave rajkot kaa rahane vaala he or ek export company kaa prabandh nideshak he
 You follow Neeraj Dave
 jab maine likhaa ki itani abhadra bhashaa kaa istemaal mat kiijie to likhata he ki mujhe dukh he ki tu abhi tak jivit he
 How much was written about Nikhil Dadich, another member of the whatsapp group
 patrkaar gauri lankesh kii hatya hui tab nikhil dadhich ne unke bare main jo kaha, wo aap kabhi pasand nahin karenge, ye or baat he ki aap us shaks ko abhi tak follow kar rahe hai
 If my information is correct
 haal hi main bijepi ke iti cell ke pramukh amit malviya ne galat tareeke se edit kii hui mere bhaashan kaa video share kiya tha
 This caused confusion
 altnews
 in also exposed him but Amit Malviya did not even reveal regret
 par sar, mujhe bilkul andaaza nahin tha ki ye nikhil dadhich mere mobile phone main aa baitha he
 i am a member of the extremely communal whatsapp group to which i am forced
 jahaan mere bare main hinsak shabdon kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 Really i did not think that the strings of the members of this group will reach you
 kaash altnews

 nikhil dadhich kii to aapke kai mantriyon ke saath tasviren hai

 One admin is named Akash Soni
 bharat kii duusari mahila rakshaamantri nirmala sitaraman ji, swasthya mantri jepi nadda ji or dilli bijepi ke adhyaksh manoj tiwari ke saath akaash soni kii tasviir he
 The picture can be with anyone, but it used to run a group of threatening or communal talk
 aapke bare main koi likh detaa he to uske whotsap group ke admin ko giraftaar kar liya jaataa he
 i have read many such news
 kya akaash soni RSS kaa pramukh padaadhikari he? akaash soni ne mere sahit abhisar sharma, rajdeep saradesai or barkhaa dutt ke phone number ko apane pej par saarvajanik kiya he

 i do not believe that a strong Prime Minister of India can take the job of a journalist
 tab log kehete hai ki thode dinon kii baat he, dekh lenaa, tumhaara intazaam ho gaya he
 Is this so sir? aisa hona mere liye saubhaahgya kii baat he

 mere liye nahin, bharat ke mahaan loktantr kii shaan ke liye, varanaa log kahenge ki agar meri awaz alag bhi he, talkh bhi he to bhi kya is mahaan loktantr main mere liye koi jagah nahin bachi he? ek patrkaar kii naukari lene kaa intazaam pradhanmantri or vittamantri ke str se hoga? aisi atakalon ko main whotsap group main di jane vaali dhamkiyon se jodakar dekhtaa hum

 Your well-wisher raveesh kumaar Journalist NDTV india Now i have a question for you
 kya aap vaaqai niraj dave or nikhil dadhich ko pholo karte hai? kyon karte hai? kuch din pehle maine inke whotsap group kaa kuch screen shot apane fasebuk pej @ravishkapage par zaahir kar diya tha
 altnews
 in ke pratik sinha or neelesh purohit kii padtaal bataati he ki group kaa sadsy niraj dave rajkot kaa rahane vaala he or ek export company kaa prabandh nideshak he
 You follow Neeraj Dave
 jab maine likhaa ki itani abhadra bhashaa kaa istemaal mat kiijie to likhata he ki mujhe dukh he ki tu abhi tak jivit he
 How much was written about Nikhil Dadich, another member of the whatsapp group
 patrkaar gauri lankesh kii hatya hui tab nikhil dadhich ne unke bare main jo kaha, wo aap kabhi pasand nahin karenge, ye or baat he ki aap us shaks ko abhi tak follow kar rahe hai
 If my information is correct
 haal hi main bijepi ke iti cell ke pramukh amit malviya ne galat tareeke se edit kii hui mere bhaashan kaa video share kiya tha
 This caused confusion
 altnews
 in also exposed him but Amit Malviya did not even reveal regret
 par sar, mujhe bilkul andaaza nahin tha ki ye nikhil dadhich mere mobile phone main aa baitha he
 i am a member of the extremely communal whatsapp group to which i am forced
 jahaan mere bare main hinsak shabdon kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 Really i did not think that the strings of the members of this group will reach you
 kaash altnews
 This investigation of in is incorrect
 nikhil dadhich kii to aapke kai mantriyon ke saath tasviren hai
 Not only this, there are many administrators of the group 'un Dharma Rakshati Rakshit:'
 kai admin ke naam RSS, RSS-2 rakhe gaye hai
 One admin is named Akash Soni
 bharat kii duusari mahila rakshaamantri nirmala sitaraman ji, swasthya mantri jepi nadda ji or dilli bijepi ke adhyaksh manoj tiwari ke saath akaash soni kii tasviir he
 The picture can be with anyone, but it used to run a group of threatening or communal talk
 aapke bare main koi likh detaa he to uske whotsap group ke admin ko giraftaar kar liya jaataa he
 i have read many such news
 kya akaash soni RSS kaa pramukh padaadhikari he? akaash soni ne mere sahit abhisar sharma, rajdeep saradesai or barkhaa dutt ke phone number ko apane pej par saarvajanik kiya he
 altnews
 in kii report main yah baat bataai gai he
 Even before, the leaders of the organization running under your leadership have made my number public and received threats
 main pareshaan to hua parantu aapako patr likhane nahin baitha
 i am writing this time because i want to know and let you also know whether people of this whatsapp group can go to the extent of killing me? Is my life in danger? main ek saamaanya naagarik hum or adana-sa parantu sajag patrkaar hum
 About whom every other day it comes out saying that soon i will come on the road with your grace
 soshal media par pichley dinon iskaa utsav bhi manaaya gaya ki ab meri naukari jaaegi
 Many said no and said that the government is after me
 haal hi main hindustan times ke sampadak bobi ghosh ko aapaki naapsandgi ke kaaran chalata kar diya gaya
 i reported this to thewire
 in main padhi
 It is my turn now
 yah sab sunakar hansi to aati he par chintit hota hum
 i do not believe that a strong Prime Minister of India can take the job of a journalist
 tab log kehete hai ki thode dinon kii baat he, dekh lenaa, tumhaara intazaam ho gaya he
 Is this so sir? aisa hona mere liye saubhaahgya kii baat he
 But don't let this happen
 mere liye nahin, bharat ke mahaan loktantr kii shaan ke liye, varanaa log kahenge ki agar meri awaz alag bhi he, talkh bhi he to bhi kya is mahaan loktantr main mere liye koi jagah nahin bachi he? ek patrkaar kii naukari lene kaa intazaam pradhanmantri or vittamantri ke str se hoga? aisi atakalon ko main whotsap group main di jane vaali dhamkiyon se jodakar dekhtaa hum
 If you do not follow these people, i do not write this letter in the right way
 mere paas aluminium kaa ek baksaa he jise lekar dilli aayaa tha
 In these 27 years God gave me a lot, but that box is still there
 main us bakse ke saath motihaari laut saktaa hum, lekin parivaar kaa daayitv bhi he
 Who does not worry about employment
 bade bade kalakaar sattar-pachhattar saal ke hokar vigyaapan karte rahete hai, taaki paise kama saken
 When so many people worry about running a house, then how can i separate from that worry
 mujhe bhi he
 You would not like to see my children on the street
 chahenge? mujhase itani nafrat? mere bachche tab bhi aapako dua denge
 i love the road main sadak par aakar bhi sawaal karata rahoonga
 On coming to Champaran, Bapu gave the example of how big the power is, no matter how unknown the place, one can stand before him with moral force
 main us mahaan mitti kaa chota sa ansh hum
 i do not speak the truth to scare anyone
 baapu kehete the ki jis sach main ahankaar aa jaae wo sach nahin rah jaataa
 i speak to make myself more humble and atone for the contradictions within me
 jab main bol nahin paata, likh nahin paata, tab us sach ko lekar jujhataa rahata hum
 In the struggle to be free from all my weaknesses, i say the thing that people hear and say that you do not fear the government
 mujhe apni kamazoriyon se dar lagata he
 i speak only to fight my weaknesses
 likhata hum
 Lose many times tab khud ko yahi dilasa detaa ki is baar fail ho gaya, agali baar paas hone kii koshish karuunga
 Speaking in front of power is a display of courage whose authority the Constitution gives and whose protector you are
 tippaniyan i am also publishing this letter publicly and sending it to you by post

 is baar likh rahaa hum kyonki main jaananaa chahta hum or aap bhi pataa karavaaen ki kya is whotsap group ke log meri jaan lene kii had tak ja sakate hai? kya meri jaan ko khatara he? i am a normal citizen and a little but conscious journalist
 jiske bare main aajkal har doosraa kahkar nikal jaataa he ki jaldi hi aapaki krupa se sadak par aane vaala hum
 It was also celebrated on social media recently that now my job will go

 Then people say that it is a matter of few days, see, your arrangements have been made
 aisa he kya sar? It is a privilege for me to be like this
 parantu aisa mat hone dijiega
 Not for me, for the pride of the great democracy of India, otherwise people will say that even if my voice is different, even if it is different, is there no room left for me in this great democracy? Will there be a provision for taking the job of a journalist from the level of Prime Minister and Finance Minister? i see such speculation related to the threats given in the whatsapp group
 agar aap in logon ko follow nahin karte to main sahi main yah patr nahin likhata
 i have an aluminum box that i brought to Delhi

 i can return to Motihari with that box, but the family also has an obligation
 rojgaar kii chintaa kise nahin hoti he
 Great artists continue to advertise after seventy-five years of age, so that they can earn money
 jab itane paise waalon ko ghar chalaane kii chintaa hoti he to main kaise us chintaa se alag ho saktaa hum
 i also have aap mere bacchon ko to sadak par nahin dekhnaa chahenge
 Would you like? Hate me so much? My children will still bless you
 mujhe sadak se pyaar he
 i will continue to question on the road
 champaran aakar baapu ne yahi to misaal di ki satta kitni badi ho, jagah kitni bhi anjaan ho, naitik bal se koi bhi uske saamne khadaa ho saktaa he
 i am a small fraction of that great soil
 main kisi ko daraane ke liye sach nahin bolta
 Bapu used to say that the truth in which ego comes is not true
 main khud ko or adhik vinamr banane or apane bheetar ke antarvirodhon ko lekar praayshchit karne ke liye bolta hum
 When i cannot speak, i cannot write, then i struggle with that truth
 main apni tamaam kamazoriyon se azaad hone ke sangharsh main hi wo baat kah detaa hum jise sunakar log kehete hai ki tumhen sarkaar se dar nahin lagata
 i am afraid of my weaknesses
 apni kamazoriyon se ladane ke liye hi bolta hum
 i write kai baar haar jaataa hum
 Then he would comfort himself that he failed this time, i will try to pass next time
 satta ke saamne bolnaa us saahas kaa pradarshan he jiskaa adhikaar samvidhan detaa he or jiske sangrakshak aap hai
 The comments main yah patr saarvajanik rup se bhi prakashit kar rahaa hum or aapako dak dwaara bhi bhej rahaa hum
 If you know Nikhil Dadhich, Neeraj Dave and Aakash Soni, then just ask them if they or any of their groups have a plan to kill me
 patr likhane ke kram main agar maine aapkaa anadar kiya ho, to maafi maangana chaahunga

 com / k21ikvozvg Railways will not privatize: The government aims to increase investment in railways; The government has emphasized on the modernization of railways
 Union Railway Minister Piyush Goyal has given a statement on the news of privatization of railways
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar railway kaa nijeekaran karne nahin ja rahi he
 Our goal is to invest a large amount in railways, for this we are considering public private partnership
 saath hi ham vishwa kii aadhuniktam takanic ko railway se jodenge
 Recently there were reports that the Railway Ministry has formed a committee to privatize 50 railway stations and 150 trains
 nijeekaran ko lekar niti ayog ne railway board ke chairman ko ek khat bhi likhaa
 This letter mentions about 400 railway stations to be made world class
 kya he maamla?aise khabaren saamne ai thim jinamein kaha gaya tha ki rail mantralay ne 50 railway steshnon or 150 trainon ke nijeekaran ke liye ek cameti banaai he
 The committee consists of CEO of NITI Aayog, Chairman of Railway Board, Secretary of Department of Economic Affairs, Secretary of Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs and Financial Commissioner (railways)
 railway 150 trainon kaa sanchaalan privet companiyon ko dene kii taiyaari main he
 It was told that the Railway Ministry has taken a decision in this regard
 niti ayog ne likhaa patranijeekaran ko lekar niti ayog ne railway board ke chairman ko ek khat likhaa tha
 In this letter, 400 railway stations were mentioned for making them world class
 isamen kaha gaya tha ki kai saal se aisi baaten kii jaati rahi hai lekin vastav main ikkaa-dukka steshnon ko chhodkar isko kahin bhi karyanvit nahin kiya gaya he
 As soon as the election comes, some young journalists start whatsapp to take me on an election journey
 aapse siikhnaa he
 Both boy and girl
 donon ko meraa jawaab 'na' he
 it's not possible
 kuch logon ne seemaa paar kar di he
 Refusal should be understood, but many people do not believe
 baar-baar massej karte rahete hai, isliye yahaan likh rahaa hum
 Why is this not possible? The first reason is that how many people can i take with me? We go through the system
 uskaa apana ek simit bajet hota he
 The car does not have the same space
 kya main bas lekar chaluun ki logon ko sikhaanaa he? phir to jahaan jaaoongaa, vahiin bhagdad much jaaegi
 Your story has to be accounted for, the first and last focus is to complete it
 isi ko dedline kehete hai
 Hi-hello doesn't have time to spare, so i know, it's not possible
 jab main reporting par hota hum, to apni kahani ke alaava kuch nahin sujhata
 Secondly, the reason is that we are not doctors to lie on the operation table and tell the intestines and teeth there
 apni story puri karne kii fikr main hi bhaagate rahete hai
 Whoever is together, he will see that stopped here
 kahaan baat kiya
 What will anyone learn by watching this? Anyway, you can see the whole process in 'prime Time'
 bahut kam editing hoti he, isliye aap andaaza laga sakate hai ki maine kya kiya hoga
 Third, there is nothing wrong in asking for a job
 main isse pareshaan nahin hota hum
 i too used to call 10 people when i was looking for a job
 media main naukari kii prakriya kii koi vyavastha nahin he, isliye aisa karnaa padataa he
 But you have to understand one thing
 main naukari or internship ko lekar baat karne ke liye adhikrut nahin hum
 The reason for this is that i am not part of the structure of the newsroom
 jo log yah kaam karte hai, vahi kisi kii bhoomika or zarurat ko behatar samajhate hai
 The quality of training is better in them, so i never answer 'yes' in terms of internship and job, because i cannot do 'yes'
 chauthi baat he ki aap kya karen? main chaahunga ki aap sabko kaam karne kaa mauqaa mili
 i did not tell anyone that i will learn by staying with you
 mujhe sahi main lagata he ki yah bahanebaazi he
 We live in such a short time that there is really no time to talk to anyone, it is a distant thing to teach
 kyon khud ko dhokhaa dena chaahate hai? aap kya karenge, aapako tay karnaa he
 Everything i do is in Sara's Public
 koi gupt rahasy nahin he
 Fat - you know what it takes to become a journalist
 phir bhi iskaa jawaab bahut aasaan he
 Write 2,000 words a day and as journalist Prakash k Ray says, read 100 pages of a book daily
 main khud jo padhata hum, vah post kar detaa hum
 So i do not have a secret reading list separately
 kai log kitabon ke bare main likhte hai
 This is also no secret information
 kahin bhi jaaen, kuch likhane kii talash main rahen
 Talk to people and do research
 aap likhte rahiye
 Will be done by writing jab tak naukari nahin he, tab tak soshal media par likhen
 Will have to write yah rose kaa abhyaas he
 You are nothing in a day
 or hona kya hota he, mujhe samaj nahin aata
 In a shock, the job is lost and people forget
 isliye patrkaar pehle khud ke liye bane
 Go out on a journey of knowing honestly, everything will be good
 tandi maarenge to dhokhaa ho jayega
 Overall, do not look for a single factory to make yourself
 alag-alag maidaanon main khud ko failaa den
 The real thing is that you guys get a chance
 ve kaafii kam hai
 Wherever i meet and there is no journalism, what can i do? itnaa to bolaa or likhaa
 He also spoke while in the job and also in his program
 aap sabhi ke liye dua hi kar saktaa hum
 Then leave this line
 nahin chhod sakate, to taiyaari karte rahen
 She will come sometime in the morning
 main bhi kai logon se sikhta hum
 You also learn from many people
 nae-nae vishyon ko samajhane vaale yuva research scollar se dosti karen
 Be polite in front of them and ask
 aise behtareen chaatro kii talash karen
 i have more friendship with people half my age
 unase chaatr kii tarah sikhta hum
 They do not face any problem
 jaise main bijnes kii khabaron se dur rahata tha
 Read the business newspapers for two years
 unki chaturaayiyon ko bhi samajha
 Started understanding his information
 jo samajha, uskaa hindi main anuwaad kar fesabook pej par post kiya
 This is because if you are a journalist, share what you know (respecting the terms of the off-record)
 pratikriyaaon ko padhaa kiijie
 Many people come forward and also tell the shortcomings
 mere paas koi jadi-booti nahin he

 The first condition of the Delhi government is that the first condition is that the price of onion should not be more than 19 rupees and this 19 rupees includes storage loss which is called storage loss and also includes the cost of transportation i
e
 transportation and the second is that the delivery of onion also to the government Needed at Anand Vihar in Delhi, not that she will take onion from Nashik

 na to wo ye maanane ko taiyaar hai ki nafed main april se lekar june tak dilli sarkaar ko chitthiyaan likhin or na ye maanane ko taiyaar hai nafed dilli sarkaar ko sasti pyaaj dene ko taiyaar thi
 The interesting thing is that the Delhi government or Aam Aadmi Party leaders have only allegations in defense, no evidence
 nafed ke diarector ashok thakur kii maane to puraa maamla sasti pyaaj kharidne yaa bechney kaa he hi nahin
 The case is to raise the stock of 2500 metric tons of onions that the central government has reserved in the name of Delhi
