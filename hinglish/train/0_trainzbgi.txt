 com / jdhqp0lrrx— Imran Khan (@imrankhanpti)december 19, 2019unhone ye non fiction fiction kitaab saal 2003 main likhi thi
 Five years after his death, columnist, journalist and writer Khushwant Singh is once again in the news
 ye charchaa unki sabase vivaadaaspad pustakon main se ek kii vajah se ho rahi he
 He wrote the book in 2003, a year after the Gujarat riots
 is kitaab ko penguin books ne prakashit kiya tha
 In observing his book, he wrote that i felt as if the nation was moving towards an end
 aadhi sadi pehle desh bantwaare kii hinsa kaa gavaah bana tha
 a lot could have been better in the country in these days, but it seems that the worst is yet to happen
 apni kitaab main unhone desh duniya main nasl, dharm or jaateey hinsa kii tamaam ghatnaon kaa hawala bhi diya he
 In the book, he has written that there is a complete possibility that India will become the same in future
 unki ye kitaab bahut charchaa main rahi
 He has written about the analysis of communal violence in Gujarat in 2002 to the 1984 anti-sikh riots, the burning of Graham Staines and his children, the targeted assassination by terrorists in Punjab and Kashmir
 khushvanth singh ne dharm ke purna bhrashtachar ke bare main sochane par majaboor kiya he
 They say that this has made us among the most cruel people on earth
 wo yah bhi bataate hai ki kattarwad kaa raajnneeti ke saath dharm se kam lenaa-dena he
 He has also written on communal politics in the book
 kehete hai ki hamane unhen chunaa he, unka poshan kiya he, or apane aapako unke hawaale kar diya he
 They have seen rebellions in Kashmir and the Northeast, caste wars in Bihar, scattered Naxalite movements, and Jewish perception of minorities as evidence that our passion for ethnic, regional and racial identity has left the country far behind
 He cannot be brought back
 philhal is kitaab ko lekar ek baar phir vivaad gaharaa gaye hai
 At the time when the book was published, it was strongly opposed by many organizations
 bataa den ki naagarikta sanshodhan bill ko lekar puure desh main chal rahe virodh pradarshan kii kadi main kai celibrity or prabud varg ke log soshal media par likh rahe hai
 Sana Ganguly and Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan shared a part of it on social media, citing this book in this perspective
 philhal sanaa ne ise delit kar diya he

 But how can you say that temples will be built there
 mandir vahiin banaaenge kaa kya matlab he
 Dasaratha was a very great Maharaja
 kaha jaataa he ki unke mahal main 10 hajaar kamare the
 Who knows where the room was? Therefore to say that we think that Lord Rama was born here, so this is where to build a temple
 kyonki yahaan ek masjid he, pehle ise ham todenge or isaki jagah ham mandir banaaenge
 Is it wrong for an Indian to believe in Allah

 com / qtckaudw70manishankar ayyar apane bayanon ko lekar kai baar charchaa main rahe hai
 Iyer was suspended from the primary membership of the Congress for using the word 'low' about PM Modi during the Gujarat elections in December 2017
 us samay pehle charan kaa chunaav chal rahaa tha or piem modi sahit puri bijepi ne isko mudda bana liya tha
 Due to which the Congress was on the backfoot
 manishankar ayyar pehle bhi apane bayanon kii vajah se party ko mushkil main daal chuke hai
 Before the 2014 elections, Iyer used the word 'chaiwala' for Narendra Modi the most and his statement was heavily redeemed by the BJP throughout the election
 saal 2018 ayyar kaa congress kii sadsyta se nilamban waapas le liya gaya
 The decision was taken following the recommendation of the party's disciplinary committee
 supreme court ne nagarikon ko sidhi nakadi skim (direct cash transfer Scheme) ko chunauti dene vaali yachika par centre or kai rajyon ko notice jari kiya he
 According to the petition, following the DCB scheme a month before the elections in Andhra Pradesh, now many states and centers can also come forward in this direction
 yachika main kaha gaya ki vidhansabha yaa loksabhaa kaa kaarykaal khatm hone yaa chunaav se 6 maheene pehle se in yojanaon par roak laga deni chahie
 The court has also called for a response from the Center, State and Election Commission on this
 yachika main piem kisaan sammaan yojana kaa hawala bhi diya gaya he
 The petition states that these schemes are in violation of the Free and Fair Election because these schemes are brought to woo voters
 yachika main kaha gaya he ki yah janpratinidhi adhinium ke tahat karpt practice ke samaan he
 Therefore, all these schemes should be declared unconstitutional and corrupt practice
 ajay devgan prakaash jha kii naveenatam film 'raajnneeti' sahit unki lagbhag tamaam filmon kaa hissaa rahe hai or jha ke mutabik unhen is rashtriya puraskaar vijeta abhinayta ke saath kaam karke majaa aata he kyonki vah har kirdaar main feet baithte hai
 Jha said 'I really enjoy working with Ajay and him with me
 vah na sirf ek mahaan peshewar he balki ek achche insaan bhi hai or unki yahi khubi unhen auron se alag karti he
 'they said,' We both have a better understanding for each other
 vah kuch bhi kar sakate hai
 No wonder when i am writing a film, one or two of its characters are such that Ajay fits in perfectly
 ’1999 se abtak jha or devgan ne saath-saath kul chaar filmon- ‘dil kya kare’ (1999) ‘gangaajal’ (2003) ‘apharan’ (2005) or ‘raajnneeti’ (2010) main kaam kiya he
 During this time Jha did not take Devgan in just one film 'rahul' (2001)
 jha ne rahul main ekadam naye chehron ko mauka diya tha or film box aphis par chaaron khaane vitt ho gai
 'gangajal' and 'kidnapping' were also commercially successful along with being discussed
 yahi vajah he ki ‘raajnneeti’ main naye puraane kai abhinaytaon ko shaamil karne ke baavjood jha ne ajay devgan ke liye ek khaas jagah rakhi
 The film also stars rising stars like Ranveer Kapoor and Katrina Kaif along with starred actors like Naseeruddin Shah and Nana Patekar
 jha ne kaha, ‘raajnneeti vishay ke bare main maine ajay se 2005 main hi baat kii thi, jin dinon ham apharan ke nirmaan main vyast the
 The outline of the story was in my mind since then which i later shaped
 ’ bataaya ja rahaa he ki jha apni aagaamee film ‘aarakshan’ main amitabh bachchan ko lene kii koshish kar rahe hai, lekin usamen bhi devgan ko lene kii pushti ho chuki he
 Regarding his most expensive film 'rajneeti' so far, Jha hopes that the film will succeed at the box office
 vah kehete hai, ‘jab ek film acha karti he to usase sabhi ko phayda hota he
 There are many good actors in politics, so people have high expectations from him
 ’yah puche jane par ki kya prakaash jha ke naam se film nahin chalegi, jha ne kaha, ‘nahin yah uchit nahin hoga
 Is a moving film, not a director
 tamaam ummiden film se judi hoti hai
 Initially people may reach the cinema hall after seeing Prakash Jha's name, but in the end only the film can keep them tied, nothing else

 ucch kshamta vaale 12 transponder yukt jisat-12 upgrah kaa jeevankaal kareeb aath varsh he
 With PSLV, it has cost about 200 crores
 ummid kii ja rahi he ki isse desh ko transpondaron kii kami se nijaat mil sakegi

" prakshepan yaan ne kaaphi sateek dhang se upgrah ko upyukt kaksha main bhej diya
 In its 18th successive successful mission, PSLV proceeded through the cloudy skies and the scientists in the control room were no longer happy after the satellite reached orbit
 isro ke adhyaksh radhakrishnan ne kaha ki pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne jisat-12 ke safal prakshepan ke liye isro kii puri team ko badhai di he
 Radhakrishnan said that in the coming month, ISRO will carry out many missions of PSLV and launch many satellites
 vahiin, isro kii is uplabdhi par badhai dete hue pradhanmantri karyaalay main rajyamantri ve narayansami ne kaha ki isse desh ko or transpondaron kii jarurat ko puraa karne main madad milegi
 GSAT-12 has been sent in an elliptical transfer orbit at the closest point 284 km to the Earth and 21,000 km at the farthest point
 isi tarah, yaan main laga taral duurastha motor upgrah (aleemes) ko vrutakar kaksha main sthapit karne main upyog main laayaa jaayegaa
 The aim of GSAT is to strengthen the capacity of INSAT system so that distance education, distance medicine and village resource center can be upgraded
 jisat-12 ko insat 2i or insat 4e ke saath sthapit kiya jaayegaa
 This is the second time in 19 launches of PSLV after Kalpana 1 in 2002 when it has been used to drop communications satellites
 isro ne is prakshepan main ucch kshamta ke 40 vinyason kaa upyog kiya jisamen chah thos motor lage hue hai jo 12 ton thos pranodak le ja rahaa he
 Earlier, carrying nine tonne propellant had been the standard for PSLP flights
 jis prakaar ke vinyas kaa upyog jisat ke prakshepan ke liye kiya gaya he, us prakaar ke vinyas kaa upyog saal 2008 main chandrayan ke prakshepan ke liye kiya gaya tha
 After two GSLV flights failed in April and December 2010, ISRO selected its trusted launch vehicle PSLV to launch GSAT-12
 jieselvi kaa prakshepan vifal rahane ke kaaran jisat-5 or jisat-5pi abhiyaan ko bada dhakka laga tha jiske kaaran transponder kii kami aa gai thi

 There are many shocking incidents of sexual abuse from all over the world
 jinamein kuch to aisi hoti hai ki insaaniyat bhi sharmasaar ho jaae
 One such case came to light two years ago in the United States
 jahaan pencilvenia ke philadelphia main ek naaballig ladki ko bandhak banaakar uske saath ek hajaar se adhik logon ne shaareerik sambandh banaae the
 People were stunned when this sensational case came to the limelight
 peedita us vakt mahaj 14 saal kii thi
 He spent 2 years of his life in hell
 jab wo kisi tarah se chhot kar un darindon ke jaal se nikali to tab jaakar haivaaniyatbhari peedita kii daastaan saamne ai
 The police and his family helped to free him
 police ne maamla darj kiya
 And this case reached a court in Philadelphia
 ek america agency ke mutabik us vakt 14 varshiya naaballig ladki kaa apane mata-pita se kisi baat lekar vivaad hua tha
 The girl got so angry that she left her house and escaped
 is dauraan vah maanav taskari ke ek racket ke changul main funs gai
 He was taken hostage by smugglers in a hotel
 or phir shuru hua us ladki ke yon shoshan kaa khatm na hone vaala silsilaa
 Customers used to come to that hotel by the hour and would go on forcibly with the minor girl
 hairaani kii baat ye thi ki is dhandhe se jude log soshal media or vigyaapan ke jariye graahakon se sampark karte the
 The owner of the hotel was also associated with this racket
 jab wo ladki in darindon ke changul se aaazaad hokar police tak pahunchi to uski kahani sunakar police vaale bhi hairaan rah gaye
 The girl claimed in her statement that over the course of two years, more than 1000 people had physical relations with her
 peedita ke vakil nadeem bezaar ne court main jaankaree dete hue bataaya ki hotel maalik or vahaan kaa staff maanav taskaron ko kiraye par cameraa dekar ladki kaa shoshan karata tha
 Lying to rent rooms to customers, minor girls were sent to their rooms to have a physical relationship
 bataaya jaataa he ki kai ladkiyaan is racket kaa shikaar ban chuki hai
 Assistant District Attorney Erin o'brien disclosed in court that the Hotel Roosevelt Inn, identified in this case, has been involved in the sex trade business several times
 isse pehle bhi kai aise maamle saamne aae hai, jisamen is hotel kii bhoomika rahi he
 When the police started investigating, the truth came out
 phir hotel kaa maalik bhi jaanch main police kaa sahyogi ban gaya tha
 He had told the court that for two years the girl was traded to the body
 police ne is maamle main kai logon ko giraftaar kiya tha
 The girl was sent along with her parents after legal action
 lekin is ghatana ne ek baar phir khulaasa kar diya tha ki ladkiyaan america main bhi surakshit nahin hai
 There are severe atrocities on them too

 is prakaar nai sarkaar main jin zyaadaatar badi pariyojnaon ko 'manjuur' bataaya ja rahaa he, ve mek in india vaali hai—agali peedi kii pandubbiyon or sena ke liye halke helicopteron se lekar vaayu sena ke liye transport vimaan, hovitger topein or pani evam jameen par kaam karne vaale ladaaku jahaajon tak
 All these schemes are worth Rs 1 lakh crore
 se zyada kii hai
 At present, out of the total 21 major supply projects undergoing various stages of the process, at least 18 projects are to be built in India
 inamen khatai main padaa arabon dollar kaa ladaaku vimaanon kaa sauda shaamil nahin he
 The government wants to promote private companies in defense production
 raksha utpaadan ke prabharee rajyamantri raav indrajit singh ne india today se kaha, ''hamaara swadeshikaran kaa lakshya hasil karne ke liye nijee udyog ko aage aana hoga
 The public sector has its own role, but after decades of experience it is clear that private companies have to step up
 ''haalanki nijee udyog kii ore se shuruaati pratikriya utsahjanak rahi he, lekin vyaavhaarik adchanon kaa ehsaas hone ke baad yah lagane laga he ki mek in india ek lanbaa safar he, jisamen kathor faisle lene kii jarurat hogi
 Take, for example, Make in India's first and largest project for the private sector: a plan by the Air Force to change its fleet of 56 Avro Medium Lift Transport aircraft
 bhartiya vaayu sena chaahati thi ki ek nijee company videshi vendor se samjhauta kare or bharat main 13,000 karod ru
 To set up a production factory under the project of lekin bhartiya or videshi companiyon ke bich kai baar baatcheet ke baavjood sirf ek sanyukt upkram hi aage aayaa—airbas-tata gathbandhan
 In his first meeting on defense supplies, Parrikar has deferred the decision to pursue the single-vendor status or tender again
 agar duusare vikalp ko apanaaya gaya to jaahir he, isamen deree hogi
 The private sector will also have to compete with the already established public sector companies (psus), which have built their infrastructure over the years
 nijee companiyon ke liye keemton ke maamle main piesu se muqabla karnaa lagbhag naammumkin he, kyonki nijee companiyon ko abhi nae sire se apane paanv jamaane honge
 They will have to recruit large numbers of people and acquire technology — which will cost heavily
 nijee kshetra agar utpaadan shuru karata he or niryaat bazaar main pravesh bhi karata he to use javabdehi or pramanikaran kii dohari chunautiyon kaa saamana karnaa hoga
 The Indian company will be accountable for not performing or underperforming, as it will sell its goods to the army and it will be difficult for most companies to achieve this due to the huge amount of deals
 iske alaava nijee kshetra ke liye apane utpaadon kaa pramanikaran paanaa kathin hoga
 Such products have to be obtained with international evidence that guarantees quality control
 ye pramaan sabhi sainya saudon ke liye anivaary hote hai
 The process of authentication is long and difficult
 har part ko register karaane main varshon lag jate hai
 Pilatus Aircraft Limited provides basic trainee aircraft to the Air Force
 company kai saal se aisa bhartiya partner khoj rahi he jiske saath milakar vah vaayu sena kii maang ke mutabik 106 vimaanon kaa utpaadan kar sake
 The search is currently on
 pilatas aircraft ke dipti siio gym roach ne kaha, ''bharat main is samay ek bhi aisi company nahin he jo vimaan bana sake, uskaa praaanpatr hasil kar sake or nirdhaarit samay main vaayu sena ko vimaan muhaiyaa kara sake
 Flight safety begins with authentication and there is not a single commercial company in India that has complete authentication measures
 '' jahaan nijee kshetra kii sabase badi maang yah he ki vah kaarobaar ke liye tex or kai tarah kii shulkon ke maamle main piesu ke samaan suvidhaayen chahta he, vahiin raksha utpaadan vibhaag samaadhaan nikaalane ke liye is samay udyog kii siforeeshon kii samiksha kar rahaa he
 Private industries have also requested the ministry not to blacklist companies on small issues
 nijee udyog sarkaar se maang kar rahaa he ki vah mek in india yojana ko phir taaja kare, jisamen sarkaar nai pariyojna kii laagat main 80 fisadi kaa vittiya sahyog karegi
 This new project is to build the next generation infantry combat vehicle, which has been introduced by companies with 10 years of required experience in defense production
 lekin parrikar ko tata or larsan and tubro jaise pehle se sthapit khiladinnon or reliance airospes jaisi nai companiyon ke bich khinchataan ko khatm karnaa hoga
 Reliance Aerospace is seeking to reduce the period of experience in defense production to five years
 haalanki sena swadeshikaran kii yojana par sahamat he, lekin use dar he ki har kharid ke maamle main aankh mundakar mek-in-india niti apnaanaa aadhunikeekaran ke liye aatmghaatee sabit ho saktaa he
 The Indian Navy, which has a proven record of self-sufficiency, warns that indigenous production is a multi-level project, requiring patience and time
 nausena pramukh admiral aar
 K
 dhawan ne india today ko bataaya, ''nausena ke paas pehle se drushti thi or isane 50 saal pehle hi shuruyaat kar di thi
 Now the whole link is working
 nirmaataaon ko yah baat samajni hogi ki yah lambii prakriya he or unhen nuksaan uthaane ke liye bhi taiyaar rahanaa chahie
 They should also be prepared that they not only have to manufacture, but also have to maintain their products till they work
 yah ek badi chunauti he
 "actually Parrikar is expected to be like a football player who has been fielded in the middle game at a time when the team is lagging behind in goal
" usase ummid kii ja rahi he ki vah warm ap hone se pehle hi gol daagna shuru kar de
 Although this expectation seems a little more than necessary, but in reality the situation does not look like it has been done
 aise main agar der hui or mek in india kaa bulbula fat gaya to yakeenan sainya balon ke liye parinaam khatarnaak sabit ho saktaa he
 Given the already strained relations with neighboring Pakistan and China, India will have no time to prepare and gear up again
 dekhnaa he ki parrikar kaise santulan saadh pate hai

 In the father's words, 'deepika's attitude was different from ordinary girls since childhood

 Born in 1984, Deepika is happy to fulfill her dream today
 veena kii tarah ve bhi ladakiyon ke liye sena kii naukari kii vakaalat karti hai
 In addition, she points to the difficulties faced by the village girls, 'the family should create a home environment to suit the girl's abilities

 pradesh main kai aise gaanv hai, jahaan ekaadh hi koi sarkari naukari main hota he
 Government job is such a big thing for such villages, whoever it may be

 The Reserve Bank and Union Ministers have started resorting to public forums to increase their numbers
 rigerv bank ke dipti governor viral acharya ne 26 aktubar ko ek vyaakhyaan main tikhaa hamalaa karte hue kaha ki, ''jo desh kendriya bank kii swatantraaa kaa sammaan nahin karte, ve aaj nahin to kal vittiya bazaaron ke kopbhaajan kaa shikaar banenge, unke yahaan aarthik aag bhadkegi or ek din aisa aayega, jab unhen pachhtaawaa hoga ki unhone ek mahatvapurn sanstha ko khokhla kar diya he
 On the other hand, their savvy counterparts, who will trust in the independence of the central bank, will be able to obtain cheap loans, will get the love of international investors and will have a longer life span
 '' unki is tippanee kii pratidhwani samooche bazaar or satta ke galiyaaron main goonjati rahi
 "the discontent between the Reserve Bank and the North Block had been burning for almost a year," says a macro economist who advises foreign investors about investing in India, but Viral's speech changed the whole picture
 '' modi sarkaar ke ek mantri, jo nahin chaahate ki unka naam jaahir ho, rigerv bank ke ravaie se kaaphi chidhe hue hai
 Observers say that although there was already a lot of tension between the two policy regulatory bodies of the government, the matter was not reached due to the constant pressure on the Reserve Bank in terms of several policy decisions in the last one year

 India's steadily growing shadow banking sector came into the limelight with the default of Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services (IL&FS), a lending company to the infrastructure sector, and there was a real possibility that a debt crisis that could cripple the economy is

 sarkaar ne kaha ki arabiai ko donon maamalon main behatar nigaraanee kerani chahie thi
 Hence, it was no surprise that Finance Minister Arun Jaitley responded to Acharya's remarks and criticized the Reserve Bank for failing to curb excessive loan disbursement
 unhone kaha, ''saal 2008 se 2014 ke bich jab bank andhadhundh lone de rahe the, to kendriya bank ne ise nazarandaaj kiya
 This was not the first time that the Finance Minister has taken up the matter of accountability of the regulators
 is saal farvari main jetali ne kaha tha, ''aakhirkaar khel ke niyam niamakon ko hi tay karne hai or niamakon ko hi apni teesri aankh hameshaa kholkar rakhni he
 But unfortunately in the Indian system we have been made accountable to the politicians, not the regulators
 ''iske baad 14 march ko apane ek bhaashan main rigerv bank ke governor urjit patel ne is aarope kaa jawaab diya

 aisa lagata he ki is kolahal kii vajah se hi tamaam bhagidaar gaharaai se mimasaa or aatmachintan nahin kar pate
 He was speaking on an important issue like ownership of banks, which was the first area of confrontation between the government and the central bank
 unhone kaha ki sabhi commercial bainkon kaa niyaman rigerv bank lekin sabhi saarvajanik bainkon kaa niyaman sarkaar karti he or rigerv bank ke paas saarvajanik bainkon ke korporate governans ke maamle main bhi koi adhikaar nahin he
 This issue was raised by Acharya in his speech

 Even the additional capital can remain and she wants it to remain as surplus
 lekin acharya ek baar phir se is maang ko galat tehraate hai
 He says, "having sufficient funds available to bear any kind of losses that may result from the functioning of the central bank and having adequate regulations to put the profits right, it is important for the central bank to remain independent of the government
 
 ''unhone kendriya bank ke ek majboot bahikhaate kii jarurat ke liye rigerv bank ke purv dipti governor rakesh mohan kii baton kaa hawala diya
 Rakesh Mohan had said, "by raiding the capital of the Reserve Bank, the government will not get any new revenue on the net and it will only create confusion about free capital in the short term
 is tarah ke transfar ke istemaal se us bharose kaa ksharan hi hoga jo ki vittiya samajhadaari dikhaane ke maamle main sarkaar ke iraadon ke prati rahata he
 "the third issue is with the jurisdiction of the regulator
" sarkaar pements ke liye ek alag regulator laane par jor de rahi he, lekin rigerv bank kaa tark he ki pement system vastav main karency kaa ek sab-set hi hota he jisko arabiai hi regulate karata he
 He argues that the formation of the Payment Regulatory Board is not in line with the announcements made in the Finance Bill by the Finance Minister
 takaraav kaa antim masalaa he enbiensi sankat
 Although both the government and the Reserve Bank have been insisting that there is nothing to worry about the cash flow, but the issue is that the cash should go to the right people
 bazaar enbiensi kii rifinancing ke liye alag windo kii maang kar rahaa he, jabaki rigerv bank is baat ke liye drudh he ki andhadhundh karj le chuki companiyon ko ab koi raahat na di jaae

 "banks with PCA prohibit new lending, expansion of branches or recruitment of new employees, which has become another issue of confrontation between the Reserve Bank and the government

 There are reports in the media that there is pressure on Governor Urjit Patel to resign
 lekin yadi vah aisa karte hai, to iskaa swaabhaavik nateeja yah hoga ki unke uttaradhikari ko puri tarah se sarkaar ke hisaab se chalanaa hoga
 If they continue in office, they will have to take immediate steps on important issues of cash flow and confidence building
 sabase mahatvapurn baat yah he ki yadi patel jate hai to yah dharna ban jaaegi ki modi sarkaar aise arthshaastriyon ke saath kaam karne main aksham he jo alag vaishvik najariya rakhte hai
 Following the surprise farewell of former Governor Raghuram Rajan, it would be considered another blow to the government

 Haridwar, popularly known as a pilgrim town, attracts pilgrims from all over the country
 snaan or puja ke baad shraddhalu mohan ji puri vaale kii puriyon, halva or kachadissoon par tut padate hai
 Mohan Ji Puri shop, which has been selling Puri for almost a hundred years, is on the tongue of the pilgrims
 shraddhaluon ke sijan ke dauraan to yahaan itani jabardast bheed umadti he ki ki bade str par puriyaan belani padati hai
 This shop was started by Parashuram Sharma
 ab ise unke pote sanjay or vijay chalaate hai
 This shop started from Har Ki Pauri has now been opened in Jwalapur in Haridwar
 mohan ji puri vaale kii dukaan main kai vyanjan milte hai, par ise puri or aalu ke liye khyaati hasil he
 Similarly, people who come here remember the lassi of Prakash Lok of Haridwar
 is dukaan kii lassi itani gadhi hoti he ki ise chammach se katkar khaaya jaataa he
 This shop was started 55 years ago by Srichandra Gopal Saini
 ab is dukaan ko unke bete sanjay saini or ajay saini chalaate hai
 According to Sanjay Saini, around one thousand people drink lassi here every day
 ve kehete hai, "hamaari lassi main gujaron ke khatton se aane vaale doodh kii dahi or chini ke alaava swaad tathaa sugandh ke liye roj water or kewda milakar taiyaar kiya jaataa he
 It contains so much cream that people are now also known as creamy lassi
 '' is lassi kaa swaad itnaa lajij he ki ise ek baar pine vaala shaks dobaaraa haridwar aane par ise jarur peetaa he
 Even he tells his acquaintances who come here to taste this lassi
 yahi vajah he ki tirthayatri or tourist puch-poochkar is dukaan main pahunchate hai
 According to Sanjay Saini, he also sells milk and kulfi but has got a trade mark from Lassi
 mithai kii talash main shraddhalu mathura waalon kii pracheen dukaan bhi pahunchate hai
 The ancient shop of Mathura people in the cool well region of Haridwar is famous for delicious Chandrakala, whole kachori and other sweets
 yahaan ke malai ke samose bhi puure haridwar main prasiddh hai
 Pure desi ghee is used to make sweets in this shop
 arase se tirthayatriyon ko swaadisht mithaiyon kaa swaad muhaiyaa karaane vaale is dukaan kaa swaroop ab bhi purana hi he
 Ankit Sharma, who runs this shop with his father, says, "my great grandfather came here from Mathura in 1930
 unhone haridwar ke moti bazaar ke thanda kuan kshetra main yah dukaan shuru kii thi
 Since then it is famous for Chandrakala
 '' unke adhiktar karigar uttar pradesh ke mathura or bulandshahr se hai, jo peedhishon se mathura waalon kii pracheen dukaan main kaam kar rahe hai
 The interesting thing is that the operators of this shop have never given any advertisement of their shop
 phir bhi yah haridwar main ek brand ke taur par mashhoor ho gai he
 According to Sharma, "we make all kinds of sweets, but our demand for Chandrakala, Chamcham and Baalshahi is high
 '' malai ke samose yahaan shaam ko sirf ek ghante tak milte hai
 This is the reason that there is a long line for it here and it is sold on a first come, first served basis

 But MGR, whose birth centenary is currently being celebrated with pomp across the state, had painstakingly portrayed the sympathies and messiahs of the poor and marginalized
 aisa unhone apni filmon ke saath-saath behad udaartaa or hameshaa baari prachaar-prasar ke saath kiye gaye daan ke jariye kiya tha
 Due to this, with the step in politics, his election victory was almost confirmed
 kai filmon main mjiaar kii nayika raheen jayalalita ne 1988 main apane guru kii jagah lee
 But he too had worked hard for a few years while working as the party's publicity secretary and then campaigning across the state and had also worked extensively during his tenure as a Rajya Sabha MP
 shuruyaat main unhone mjiaar kii chamak-damak kaa phayda uthaaya, par jaldi hi unhone unki muravvat or udaartaa kii jhalak apana lee or dheron loklubhaavan, garib samarthak upayon ke jariye khud apane prati samarpit samarthakon kaa aadhaar taiyaar kar liya

 Both MGR and Jayalalithaa were not native to Tamil Nadu
 lekin unhone tamil cinema or samaaj main acha-khaasaa yogadan diya tha or logon ke dilon main apni jagah banaakar unki manjuuri hasil kii thi
 But now the Tamil sub-nationality is being re-emphasized and many people are strongly criticizing the 'outsiders' who are intent on keeping the state in politics
 naam tamilaar kaachi ke joshilay mukhya sanyojak semen jor dekar kehete hai, ''timil log rajnikant sareekhe maratha ko mukhyamantri ke taur par kabhi sweekaar nahin karenge! '' adaakaar—nirdeshak semen 'talaiva' rajnikant ke pradesh kii raajnneeti main aane se khush nahin hai
 This puts Kamal Haasan on perhaps stronger ground
 saamaajik or siyaasi muddon par unke hameshaa pakke vichaar rahe hai, haalanki unhone pehle har baar unhen utana joardaar dhang se jaahir nahin kiya he jitna, ferj kiijie, rajnikant ne kiya he

 '' iske baavjood camel hasan ne haal hi main dramuk ke dainik akhbaar mursoli ke ek aayojan se kanni kaat lee thi or kaha tha ki unhone party main shaamil hone ke bahut puraane nyaute par abhi koi faisla nahin kiya he
 Whether the issue is of Sri Lankan Tamils or the Cauvery water dispute or more recently Jallikattu, eminent film personalities of Tamil Nadu have been known to take a political stance
 rajnikant pehle bahut mukhar hua karte the (1996 main unhone kaha tha ki agar jayalalita phir jeetin to tamilnadu ko bhagwaan hi bachaa saktaa he—jayalalita haar gai thim) or ab apana sandesh pahunchane ke liye arth bhare ishaare karte hai or 'maarak' samvaad bolte hai
 In contrast, Kamal Haasan has coined himself as an enthusiastic voice of public intellectual and social opposition
 yahi unki takat he or isi takat ke jariye ve siyasat main apni jagah talash karne kii koshish kar rahe hai
 However there is also a lesson
 mjiaar or jayalalita kii kamyaabi bhale hi prerak ho, par camel hasan or rajnikant sareekhe siyasat main aane ke icchhuk film waalon ko, misaal ke taur par, 2005 main dmdike party banane vaale captain vijayakaanth ke tajurbe se shaayad sabak lenaa or aagaah hona chahie
 The party of 'karuppu MGR' ('yamrang MGR') managed to win 29 seats in 2011 and emerged as the second largest party as an alliance partner with the AIADMK beating the DMK
 magar uske baad iskaa vot bank lagaataar chhijata gaya, is had tak ki 2016 main iskaa puri tarah safaya ho gaya
 Kamal Haasan may have initially trusted his fans for his political base
 haalanki unke boote chunaav jeet paane kii bahut kam ummid he
 Despite this, while the other actors of his generation, including Rajinikanth, were increasing their fan base for more cinematic success, Kamal Haasan truly transformed his fans into a social service organization with great effort, blood donation and Other campaigns included

 He says, "we should not forget that Kamal Haasan is a great actress and a much bigger makeup artist
 unke paas adkvay urja bhi he
 But for politics they may be too much emotion
 apni baat ko saaf or vajandaar dhang se kahana unki takat he, magar unki kamajori yah he ki unka siyaasi afasana kuch is tarah hota he maano ve soshal media par fain klbon ko yaa prashansakon ko sambodhit kar rahe hai or unka yah bharosa ki ve unki khatir sab kuch hilaa denge, shaayad kuch zyada naatakeeyata par aadhaarit he
 Political experts in Tamil Nadu believe that Kamal Haasan's chances of winning even one of the 234 assembly seats in the state seem blurred at the moment
 unka kahana he ki agar ve siyasat main aane ko lekar sanjeeda hai to unke paas dramuk kii aguai vaale gathbandhan se judye ke alaava koi chaara nahin he
 Meanwhile, by canceling the membership of 18 rebel members of the AIADMK, the Speaker of the Assembly has confirmed that the rivalry over Jayalalithaa's legacy is not over yet

 Also, while hearing the petition of disqualified mlas, the court stayed the by-elections in these 18 constituencies declared 'vacant' after the Speaker's decision
 adhyaksh dhanpal ne jawaab dene ke liye 4 aktubar tak kaa vakt liya he
 In the coming weeks, three important issues related to AIADMK will be resolved
 ek, hycourt ko yah faisla karnaa he ki apni hi party kii sarkaar se samarthan waapas lenaa kya swechha se vidhansabha kii apni sadsyta chhodie ke baraabar he—adhyaksh ne isi daleel par 18 sadasyon kii sadsyta radd kii he
 After the merger of EPS and OPS factions, it is expected that the Election Commission will consider the future of aiadmk's 'do patti' election symbol on 6 October
 or annadramuk kii general council kaa party mahasachiv ke vivaadit pad ko khatm karne kaa faisla 23 aktubar ko hycourt main sunwaayee ke liye aayega
 But the difficulties of the ruling party may increase further
 tamilnadu vidhansabha ke sadasyon kii prabhavi taadaad 19 (18 vidhayakon kii sadsyta radd hone or jayalalita kii ab bhi khaali seat ke saath) ghat gai he
 In such a situation, the AIADMK can win the strength test in the Assembly on the strength of its current 116 members
 haalanki kaha ja rahaa he ki kam se kam 12 or sadsy ipies kii sarkaar ke khilaaf hai, jisase annadramuk kaa bahumat or ghat saktaa he
 This could come down to 98 opposition members (DMK-89, Congress-8 and IUML-1)
 isse siyasat nae mode par dikh sakati he
 "the AIADMK party is slowly but surely disintegrating," says Manivannan
 yahaan tak ki agar ve dhadon main bante bhi rahete hai, to unka bachanaa puri tarah satta main tike rahane par nirbhar karegaa, jayalalita kii us aatma par nahin jisaki ve din bhar duhai dete rahete hai
 "they also say," Political power is the only window to this government, through which it has kept the three-trio of the BJP government of Delhi and its Alambardars of the state alive
 yah kathputli sarkaar he jo jayalalita kii viraasat or unki aguai main may 2016 main annadramuk ko mili janadesh ko peeche chhod chuki he
 "the bjp's advisors who have led the way to the EPS and OPS have now been left with the only way to save the AIADMK to help them win the party's election symbol" Do Patti "
 yahi ek rasta he jisase ipies kii sarkaar ke liye agle chunaav tak chijen shaayad thik- thaak ho sakati hai, basharte vah bachi rahe
 However, there is a political need for the BJP at the Center to remain the EPS government, so that the AIADMK will be supported in the Parliament
 is bich dramuk khuleam vidhansabha main shakti pareekshan kii maang kar rahi he
 Its sole purpose is to bring the plight of the AIADMK
 vah jaanati he ki ipies kii sarkaar dilli ke rahamokaram par he or madhyavadhi chunaavon kii taiyaari main juty he, jo ab se 18 maheenon main hone vaale loksabhaa chunaavon ke saath ho sakate hai
 Says Manivannan, "the DMK is hoping that the unbridled faction of the AIADMK will work in its favor
" magar yah najariya jamini halaat ko badalane kii bhaajapa kii takat ko kam karke aankata he
 "actually, the DMK does not need to do much to maintain its support base, though it is small parties (odds of losing 1 in 2016)
" 5 fisadi vot se zyada ve yogadan kar sakati hai) ko bhi chhitakane nahin de rahi he
 There is no doubt that this is where Kamal Haasan or Rajinikanth, if they form new parties, may play a big role in the politics of the state
 vajah yah he ki annadramuk ke vot bank se alag hue dhade unke paale main ja sakate hai
 By the way, the leadership of the DMK is not much bothered by this math
 ve siyaasi molbhav kii apni takat ko aakhir tak bachaae rakhana chahenge
 Of course, the party leaders would like that any adverse impact of the 2G scam decision, which is going to come on October 25, gets blurred in the memory of the voters before the assembly elections, whether the elections are mid-term or only after the assembly term ends

 medical store par jaakar ham jo bhi dawa kharidte hai, sabase pehle uske upar likhi expyri date dekhte hai
 You follow the same habit while buying food and drink, but can you claim that you do not use anything that has expired? Most of us expire every day pillow, brush , Use bras and other things
 par maje kii baat ye he ki hamen is baat kaa pataa hi nahin hota he ki ye chijen bhi samay ke saath expire ho jaati hai

 chah maheene main badal dena chahie takiyaashayad hi aapane kabhi ye sochaa ho ki aapkaatkiya bhi expire ho saktaa he
 However, the time the pillow expires depends on the fiber filled in it

 However, a pillow made of good feathers and wool lasts for eight years

 But slowly the bristles of the brush begin to deteriorate
 jisase na to daanton kii sahi tareeke se safai ho paati he or to or masoodon main chot bhi lag jaati he
 Experts believe that the brush should be replaced within 30 days
 saath hi brush ko acchhee haalat main rakhane ke liye use brush karne ke baad garm pani se dhokar rakhana chahie taaki usamen fanse food partical baahar nikal jaaen or bacteria panpane kii naubat hi na aae

 But do you know that your bra also expires? After a few months you will also feel that the shape of your bra is not the same as before and it has become loose
 aisi bra pahananaa thik nahin he isseshape bighad saktaa he

 Some of them asked, 'are you going to win Modi?' The answer came from the front, 'I am not interested in Modi, nor in Kejriwal, going to the village for necessary work
 ' railgadee chal padi to mulakaatie neeche utar gaye, lekin railgadee kii raftaar ke saath bahes kii raftaar bhi badhati gai
 The debate by those who are disinterested in the election can supersede any professional electoral debate
 ek yuvak ne bahes main hastkshep karte hue kaha ki chunaav main ruchi bhale na ho lekin deshhit main vot to dena hi chahie
 The middle man sitting in front said that who is in the national interest? The third person told Tapak that this time Modi should be tried
 is bich apni seat par akhbaar pard rahe ek noujvaan ne ek pramukh angreji dainik main prakashit ek report saamne badha di
 a photo of the Gujarat model was presented in the report
 report main bataaya gaya tha ki sanand main do bade motor kaarkaanon ke baad vahaan ke kisaanon kii aaj kya dasha he, or ve kis manosthiti main ji rahe hai
 Presenting the main points of the report, the young man asked that would you like this model across the country? Silence prevailed for some time, then another middle-aged man asked, 'does the country also have a model? When the geographical location, social status, language of the country are all different, how can a country develop from a model? On this, the person advocating Modi said, "so should Kejriwal be voted on?" The young man replied, 'after reading this report, Kejriwal's words seem correct
 'adhed vyakti ne bhi yuvak kaa samarthan kiya, 'kejariwal bhale aadmi hai
 The country today needs at least thousands of Kejriwal
 ' kejariwal ke paksh main badhate samarthan ko dekh modi samarthak ne kaha ki kejariwal ko bura koun kahata he, bas unamem anubhav kii kami he
 This time an elder replied, 'if a non-experienced person can beat up big experienced pundits, i understand that experienced people should leave the way for such honest youth
 aakhir ve inhen gaiyr anbhavi yuvaaon kii hi to duhai de rahe hai
 'new characters were being added to this endless debate, and the Kashi Vishwanath Express, run by Kashi veteran late Congress leader and freedom fighter Kamalapati Tripathi, was moving at its own pace

 Apart from Modi of BJP and Kejriwal of AAP, Ajay Rai of Congress is in the fray as the prime candidate
 us vakt plane kii raftaar thi saat sau kilometre prati ghanta
 At the same speed, he was coming down from a height of 38 thousand feet
 par kuch is tarah ki naa plane ko jhatka lag rahaa tha or naa hi musafiron ko koi shaq
 The main pilot outside the cockpit understood that the plane was rapidly going down
 sirf 11 minute mili the ko-payalat andres lubitj ko or in 11 minuton main hi usne plane ko aisa control kiya ki 150 musafiron ke saath uske parakhche uda die
 German authorities have released the last 11-minute conversation inside the aircraft for the first time and the last 11-minute full story after the plane's black box investigation was completed
 isi baatcheet se pehali baar ye khulaasa hua ki jab germanvings kaa vimaan 150 musafiron ke saath alpus ke pahaad se takaraayaa tab uski speed 700 kilometre prati ghanta kii thi
 Some of the sounds and screams of the black box are going to make the rage stand out
 khaskar aakhri paanch minute
 That last five minutes, after seeing the passengers outside the windows, realized that the plane was going down fast
 iske baad puure vimaan main bas cheekh-pukaar kii hi aawaaj gunjane lagi or ye aawaaj tab thami jab sabase pehle vimaan kaa dahinaa wing alpus ke pahaad se takaraayaa or ek joardaar dhamaake kii aawaaj ai
 It had been two hours since the plane flew from Barcelona
 vimaan samay par tha or aadhe ghante baad use apni manzil par land karnaa tha
 Shortly before, pilot Captain Patrick had also announced that at what altitude the plane is flying and what is the weather ahead? Now just a short time later had to prepare for landing
 10:29 minutelanding se pehle main payalat captain patric toilet jane ke liye uthta he
 The aircraft was still on auto pilot mode
 captain patric cockpit chhodane se pehle apane ko-payalat andraej ko charge saunp detaa he or washroom jane ke liye cockpit se baahar nikal jaataa he
 10:30 minutes, as soon as the pilot goes out, Andrés immediately locks the cockpit door manually
 iske baad vimaan ko 38 hajaar feet se sidhe 100 feet kii oonchai par laane ke liye auto-payalat mod ko chanj kar detaa he
 This causes the aircraft to come down at a fixed speed rather than suddenly and the passengers are not even shocked
 10:31 minteerebas ko teji se neeche aata dekhakar air trephic control hawaii jahaaj se sampark karne kii koshish karti he
 Immediately gives the message
 lekin cockpit se koi jawaab nahin miltaa
 10:32 min Pilot Captain Patrick realizes in the washroom that the plane is going down
 wo fouran baahar aata he or cockpit kaa darwaja kholane ke liye password daalata he
 But surprisingly the door does not open
 iske baad payalat darwaja khatkhatata he
 But no sound comes from inside
 10:33 mintesb payalat pehali baar kisi anhoni se ghabaraata he or badhavaasee main jor-jor se darwaja peetane lagata he
 But still no sound comes from inside
 10:34 mintesb plane ke baaki kru members bhi cockpit ke paas pahunch jate hai
 All give voice to the co-pilot
 par andar ab bhi khamoshi he
 10:35 Minutes Pilots and crew members are seen banging on the cockpit door and screaming, for the first time, the passengers know the truth
 sachai ye ki ko-palat ne andar se darwaja band kar liya he or plane teji se neeche kii taraf ja rahaa he
 Panic spreads throughout the plane and every traveler starts crying
 ab tak chah minute biit chuke the
 But neither the cockpit door opened nor the plane stopped going down
 par in chah minuton main jo sabase bura hua wo ye ki ab vimaan main savaar musafiron ko pataa chal chukaa tha ki ko-payalat cockpit kaa darwaja band kar vimaan ko neeche kyon le ja rahaa he
 10:36 min
 Pilot Captain Patrick was still constantly trying to open the door of the cockpit
 fer unki ye naakaam koshish musphiron ko or zyada daraa rahi thi
 10:37 min When all attempts to open the door by beating, knocking and kicking failed
 captain patric kisi dhaatu se daravaaje par chot maarthe hai, kyonki joardaar chot maarane kii aawaaj record ho rahi he
 This was probably Pilot Captain Patrick's last attempt to enter the cockpit
 10:38 minute'tarren-puddp' yani neeche jate hawaii jahaaj ko rokane ke liye di janevaali immergency alarm kii aawaaj bhi ab band ho jaati he
 10:39 min Pilot Captain Patrick is heard screaming once more
 wo lagbhag gidgidaate hue andraej se aakhri guhaar lagaate hai, 'plis open da dam door'
 But even his last scream does not get any response from the cockpit
 10:40 minuteis badakismat flite kii ye aakhri ghadi thi
 As soon as the plane comes down, the right wing of the aircraft first collides with the top of the Alpus
 puure saat sau kilometre kii raftaar se
 As soon as the collision occurs, the rags of the wing fly away and then the rest of the plane also hits the mountain
 takkar itani bhayanak thi ki vimaan kaa malba or tukdon main bati laashen kareeb do kilometre ke daayre main udakar bikhar jaati he
 In this way, just in the 11th minute after taking command of the pilot, Adrez had killed 149 people, including his own life
 german jaanch adhikariyon kii maane to blike baks se ye bhi pataa chalata he ki andraej lubiz us roj kaaphi der se payalat patric ko cockpit se baahar jane ke liye uksaa rahaa tha
 Just after takeoff, when the aircraft had caught its fixed height, since then it was repeatedly telling Captain Patrick that he can go to the washroom whenever he wants, he is ready to take control of the flight at any time

 Chinese smartphone maker oneplus launched its flagship smartphone oneplus 5 a few months ago
 rivyuu main ise is segment kaa best android smartphone bataaya gaya
 Last year, the company launched the second variant oneplus 3T after the flagship smartphone oneplus 3
 is baar bhi ummid kii ja rahi thi ki oneplus 5T launch kiya jayega
 but it's not like that
 reports ke mutabik company ab sidhe 2018 main oneplus 6 launch karegi
 According to the news, the company will launch its flagship smartphone in early 2018
 is smartphone main kya hoga ye bada sawaal he
 Since its launch now has few months left, leaks and reports related to it have started coming on the Internet
 oneplus 6 main kya he hoga khaas or bharat main isaki keemat kya hogichauneflus 6 par company ne kaam karnaa pehle se hi shuru kar diya he,haalanki abhi company ne aadhikariktor par kuch bhi nahin kaha he
 oneplus started preparing for oneplus 6 from the launch of its flagship oneplus 5
 philhal saaf nahin he ki isamen kya hoga khaas
 Because oneplus is known about the features offered in it
 is baar company oneplus 5 or oneplus 3T se bilkul alag dizin par kaam kar rahi he
 That is, it will now have an edge to edge display and bezels will be equal
 philhal kam bejal vaale smartphone laane kaa trend he or isamen aipal or samsung se lekar vivo jaisi companiyaan bhi hai
 So this time it is certain to get edge to edge display
 procesar koun sa hoga ye abhi nahin kaha ja saktaa he
 But this will depend on which processor Qualcomm will launch next year
 reports ke mutabik agle saal company Snapdragon 845 launch karegaa isliye oneplus 6 main ye nayaa procesar yuj kiya ja saktaa he
 This time the company has launched two RAM variant smartphones
 ek main 6GB ram jabaki duusare main 8GB ram he
 So will the next smartphone have more than 8GB of RAM? This is the big question
 lekin zyada ummid he ki is baar company donon vairient 8GB ram ke saath hi launch karegi or isaki internal memory 128GB or 256GB kii hogi
 Since this time the company has launched a dual rear camera with a smartphone, so this time it is also going to be a dual camera
 haalanki is baar selfi ke liye bhi do camera diya jaae to koi hairaani nahin hogi
 Although the company can use a new sensor this time
 keemten hameshaa van plus ke liye plus point rahi hai khaas kar bharat main
 Because the prices of other smartphones in this segment are very high
 isliye is baar bhi company se ummid kii ja sakati he ki bharat main isaki keemat 40 hajaar se kam hi hogi

 Even though GST is about to end in Malaysia, it led to the departure of the frozen party in power for sixty years, but traders in India have welcomed BJP even after GST and demonetisation
 sirf bharat main yah trend nayaa dekhne ko mil rahaa he
 Surat traders were devastated by GST after demonetisation but maintained their unwavering faith in BJP and Prime Minister Modi
 is theory ko galat sabit kar diya ki jiesti ke baad hone vaale chunaavon main lagu karne vaali party haar jaati he
 Surat thinks differently politically
 aarthik tabaahi ko raajnneeti se nahin jodta he
 It should be a subject of study for the sociologists of the world

 It is obvious that the workers will be getting less work
 mazdoor or vyapaaree donon pareshaan honge
 Congress should go and make notes there
 main is par kai baar likh chukaa hum
 In the Gujarat elections, many journalists started writing about the destruction of Surat that this outrage will outweigh the BJP
 kuch se kahata rahaa ki yah ek tathy he ki ve tabah ho chuke hai magar yah galat he ki bijepi ke alaava kisi or ko vot denge
 i did not go to Gujarat elections but my point turned out to be correct
 surat duniya kaa pehla udhaaharan he jahaan aarthik tabaahi kaa raajnneetik mat parivartan se koi sambandh nahin he
 The reporters were surprised at my point, the businessmen had told me that they could not vote for anyone else

 If you take the name of India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi in front of any official in Beijing, the capital of China, then an enthusiastic smile will blossom on his face
 china sarkaar ko bharat ke nae pradhanmantri main apana kuch aks dikhaai detaa he-ek majboot, nirnaayak netaa jiskaa jor vikaas par he, jo china kii aarthik safalataa se seekhney ko utsuk he or kabhi bhi america ke bhulaave main nahin aayega
 On May 27, the first page of China's official daily was shouting, "modi will increase relations with China
" ’’ china daily akhbaar kaa sampadakeey donon deshon ke bich adhik rachanaatmak sambandh judye kii sambhaavna se ullasit tha, jo unki ‘‘samruddhi hasil karne kii ek samaan abhilaashaaon’’ se sanchalit honge
 When Narendra Modi visited China in 2011, he was honored as head of state, had the rare privilege of receiving a reception at the Great Hall of the People and meeting four members of the ruling Politburo
 china daily bade utsaah se yaad karata he ki modi ne bhi apane mejabaanon ke prati utana hi aadar dikhaaya tha or unhen jo bijness card bhent kiye the, un par ‘‘laal rang main chini bhashaa main parichay tha jo rang china main sampada or saubhaahgya kaa pratik mana jaataa he
 "the government in China is hopeful and confident that under Prime Minister Modi's leadership, India will seek investment from China in the same manner and allow it to do so in a favorable manner as the opportunity was given in Gujarat under Modi's leadership
" aaj jab myanmar main china ke sabase bade nivesh jan andolanon or maanav adhikaron ke durupyog ke aaropon kii maar jhel rahe hai, us samay modi beijing main shaasha or sampann varg ko ekadam alag tarah ke saathi ke rup main dikhaai de rahe haih ek aisa shaks jo vipaksh ko kuchalakar rakh detaa he or kisi bhi tarah se kaam karvaa lene kii kala ko jaanata he
 Whether this path is right in the eyes of its supporters or wrong in the eyes of critics
 china yah bhi nahin bhuulaa he ki jab america modi ko vija nahin de rahaa tha us samay ve china kaa daura kar rahe the
 Qiang Feng, a South Asian affairs expert, has said in an editorial article in the nationalist newspaper Global Times that "china did not draw any Lakshman line on the basis of ideology" when Western countries were insulting Modi and blocking his path
 ’’ unka kahana he ki yah donon nazariye ‘‘ekadam vipareet hai
 "he argues that now it will be difficult for the West to woo India and control China
" iske baavjood china sarkaar yah sochane kii bhul nahin kar sakati ki modi uski god main aa baithenge
 She knows that the economic reasons under which Modi was increasing pranks from China will force him to pursue relations with the US, which the previous government has wired in the name of Devyani Khobragade
 washington main abhi se obama sarkaar ko naseehaten di ja rahi hai ki ve maukey kaa phayda uthaaen or bharat kii nai sarkaar, khaskar modi ke saath nai shuruyaat karen

 ummid kii ja rahi he ki ve china ke sabase bade pratidwandvi is purvi asian desh ke saath pratiraksha or suraksha ke sambandh majboot karenge
 Modi seems to have made a deep friendship with another overbearing nationalist leader, Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe
 yah baat or he ki china, abe ko na to pasand karata he or na hi un par vishwaas karata he
 China would know that Abe follows only three people on Twitter, one of which is Modi
 is rishte par china sarkaar kii najar auron jitani hi gahari hogi
 Experts in China have no hope that Modi will miraculously resolve China's years-old border dispute with India
 china is mood main katai nahin dikhataa ki vah bharat ke liye kuch ilaakai riyaayaten de degaa
 It also seeks to consolidate its maritime claims to the last extent in the southern China and East China Seas
 prachaar ke dauraan modi ne china ko ‘‘apni vistaaravaadi soch’’ ko chhodie kii salaah di thi, lekin usase beijing main kuch zyada khatre kii ghantiyaan nahin baji, balki ise kaaphi had tak us aadmi ke liye prachaar ke hathiyaar ke rup main dekha gaya, jo apni rashtravaadi saakh majboot karne ko bechun tha
 a reviewer in China has made headlines by comparing Modi to US Republican President Richard Nixon
 duniya jaanati he ki maao ke china ke saath nicksan ke gahare rishte the
 Yet it makes more sense to compare Modi with Atal Bihari Vajpayee
 unke netritv main china ke saath bharat ke rishte sudhare the or vyapaar kaa dayera badha tha
 China believes that the incidence of history is less on the shoulders of the BJP than the Congress

 The Chinese government never understood India's unbridled media and when the more nationalist television channels of India criticized the alleged encroachment on the border, the Chinese government began to blame the Indian government for it
 china ko media par fauladi shikanja rakhane kii aadat he isliye use shaq hona swaabhaavik tha ki bharat kaa videsh mantralay kisi-na-kisi ghatana ke bahaane use nishane par rakhwa rahaa he
 Even if it was not so, he could hold back the emotion
 haalanki sachaai shaayad yah thi ki televijan anker upie sarkaar kii chuppi or niskriyata se utpann shunya ko hi bharne kii koshish kar rahe the kyonki sarkaar koi agenda tay nahin kar pai thi
 According to experts in China, former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's government was in "indecision and extreme caution", while Modi is considered "ambitious and aggressive", meaning criticism is not mandatory
 china kam-se-kam us vyakti ke saath kaam karne ko utsuk he, jo use apana sa lagata he
 Now China can only expect that the direction of Indian foreign policy will be decided by Narendra Modi, not by television anchor Arnab Goswami

 nannapaneni apni cancerrodhi dawa bechney ke liye taiyaar hai, jo kidney or liver ke behad gambhir ho chuke cancer se peedit rogiyon ke liye jeevanarakshak he
 At present, compared to the medicine available by the big pharmaceutical company Bayer in the market, the patient will have to spend only three percent of the money on Nannapaneni medicine

 Natco has been instructed to pay six per cent of the sale of Sorafavnet to Bayer in the form of royalties and will submit details of the sale and payment of royalties every quarter

 This is the first case of mandatory license granted in the last seven years since the amended patent law came into force

 Although Bayer can challenge this order in court, it has opened the way for domestic pharmaceutical companies to introduce a generic version of the product in the context of expensive medicines, as well as the option of compulsory licensing
 ye davaaiyaan akasar cancer ke upachaar main prayog hoti hai
 With this, companies doing research to make medicines will also work more cautiously in terms of selling patented products in India and setting their prices
 natco ne generik nexavar kaa utpaadan or vitaran karne ke liye bair se svaichhik license kii maang kii thi, jise usne khaarij kar diya tha
 Natco then applied for a compulsory license in 2011

 But the increasing awareness of prices outside the capacity of anti-cancer drugs forced him to focus on affordable generic medicines since 2003, which led Natco out of the crisis

 Niece 10 bahan There has been a new twist in the case of bank robbery through the tunnel in Gohana, Haryana
 police kii jaanch main saamne aa rahaa he ki Four more people were also involved in the conspiracy to rob the bank and they were given five-five thousand rupees for digging the tunnel
 shuukravaar ko giraftaar kiye gaye arvind ne bhi paanch hajaar rupee lekar surang khodne main madad kii thi
 Four people have been arrested in this case so far and 43 kg, 522 grams of jewels have been recovered from them
 mukhya aropiyon main se ek faraar aaropee rajesh ko police kii paanch timen haryana or aasapaas ke rajyon main talash kar rahi he
 The mastermind of this bank robbery, which shocked people across the country, committed suicide
 dilachasp baat he ki jis viraan makaan main surang khodne kii shuruyaat hui, vah uskaa maalik tha
 Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) has created a stir in the Samajwadi Party (SP) on the statement of the Supreme President
 sapa samaj nahin paa rahi ki 2019 membijepico haraane ke liye usne bispi ke saath jis gathbandhan kaa man banaaya tha, uskaa aisa hashr hoga
 Mayawati recently created a political uproar by saying that she is neither 'aunt' nor her 'nephew'
 isamen koi do raay nahin ki mayawati daliton kii sarvamaanya netaa hai, isliye bispi ke saath gathbandhan kii bijepi or sapa kii hameshaa koshish rahati he
 Both these parties feel that they may have an alliance with the BSP supremo
 agra main bispi kaa ek bhi aisa netaa nahin he jo mayawati or unke haalia 'mizaaj parivartan' ke bare main kuch bol sake lekin sapa pramudkhilesh yadavako 'damege control' karte aasaani se dekha ja saktaa he
 Akhilesh is currently battling together on three fronts — the attacking stance of the BJP, the ambition of Mayawati and the imminent danger of the party's Samajwadi Secular Front forming its uncle, Shiv Yadav
 bijepi jahaan upi main vikaas kii bayaar bahaakar akhilesh ke 'pragatisheel netaa' kii image par batta laga rahi he, to mayawati apane pattey tabhi khol rahi hai jab sabake pattey khatm ho chuke hon
 The more serious thing for Akhilesh is that the party that his uncle has formed will crack the vote bank of the Samajwadi Party, if not today, because there are many leaders who have cleared Akhilesh and are in touch with Shivpal
 sapa ke ek netaa ne india today ko bataaya ki jis baat kaa dar tha vahi hua or mayawati ne sara moltol karne ke baad paala badal liya
 Mayawati saw that in the next election, most of the sp's vote may go to Shivpal Yadav party
 jiskaa ant nateeja sapa ke vot bank main sendhamari he
 In such a situation, the SP will lose votes and the BJP will leave comfortably
 netaa ne aage kaha, pichley chunaav main sapa aurcongresane jab ek saath chunaav ladaa to donon partiyon kaa votbank gathbandhan ko nahin mil paaya
 This led to a severe defeat of SP
 kuch aisa hi maajaraa 2019 ke chunaavon main ho saktaa he, jab bijepi ko ekamusth vot mil jaae or vah aage nikal jaae
 It is possible that Mayawati is also thinking on the same line that if she supports the non-bjp alliance, then the bsp's votebank may go to the coalition, but they are skeptical about the vote of the alliance
 kuch aisa hi soch kar unhone alag rahane kaa faisla kiya he

 Recently on 5 February, Sneha received her 'no Cast, No Religion' certificate
 sneha tamilnadu, vellore ke tirupattur se hai
 Not only Sneha himself, but also her parents, since childhood, left empty columns of caste and religion in all certificates

 More than that, Sneha wanted a separate identity of herself without caste and religion
 naa koi jati naa koi dharm certificatesneha ne kaha, mere saare praaanpatron main cast or relijan ke sabhi kollam khaali hai
 This includes my birth certificate and all school certificates
 in sabhi main sirf mujhe bhartiya bataaya gaya he
 i realized that the community certificate was mandatory in all applications, so i had to get a self-affidavit
 taaki main yah kaagazon main sabitkar sakuun ki main kisi jati or dharm se judi nahin hum
 When there are certificates for those who follow caste and religion, then why not for people like us
 sneha ne saal 2010 main no-caste, no-religion ke liye aavedan kiya or 5 farvari 2019 ko bahut hi mushkilon ke baad unhen yah certificate mila
 Now Sneha has become the first person or woman who has this certificate

 This question is number one of political discussions in Bengal
 jab koi sawaal sambhaavna number ek ban jaae to iskaa matlab yah he ki log ek jawaab khoj rahe hai
 This question arises in the streets and meeting halls of Kolkata
 yah or baat he ki gum-phirakar vahiin pahunch jaataa he ki shaayad aane main time lag jaae
 In this sense, BJP has made enough space in political discussions
 iskaa matlab yah bhi he ki trinmul congress ke saamne sipiem charchaa number ek party nahin rahi
 Even the Congress form does not get scattered anywhere
 log jaldi se congress ko ek line main nipta dete hai ki party to dikhti hi nahin he
 This thing has a lot of power too
 sharada ghotaale ko lekar bijepi or sipiem kii posterbazi to dikh bhi jaati he, lekin congress kii kahin nahin dikhti
 The Congress flag was seen at some shops in a barely big market
 vahiin par indira, rajeev or mahatma gandhi kii phulon se saji pratimaa bhi dikhi, lekin in apwaadon ke alaava congress luptpraaya party ho gai he
 The CPM has attacked Mamata over the Saradha scam, but she too is rapidly sliding down in political discussions
 ek sajjan ne kaha ki sipiem ke samarthak or kaaryakarta pehle trinmul gaye or ab unhen ek or adda mil gaya he 'bijepi'
 a bank employee said, Trinamool has just become the CPM of Bengal, BJP has to come through the movement and this path is long, so after two years the seat will increase, but the government will not be able to form
 unke paas netaa koun he
 
 
 The The BJP will also have to go through a long period of agitation
 
 
 " bank karmchaaree apni samajhadaari ko siddhant kii tarah vyakt kar rahe the
 He told a retired school master that if the Trinamool is CPM, he laughed, saying that everyone in Bengal knows that seeing the CPM weakened, their workers came to the Trinamool for protection and some of those who remained in the CPM, some of them now go to the BJP It has been, BJP has become aggressive about the Sharda scam
 
 
 sibiai or idi ke kaaran bijepi sandesh dene main safal rahi he ki vah ab bengal main sangrakshan dene kii sthiti main he
 One thing has been understood by the Master's talk that people first got rid of CPM and now if Trinamool is also becoming CPM then this is not a good sign for the party
 dhyaan rahe ki sari baatcheet kolkata main ho rahi he
 
 
 The middle class of Kolkata has changed
 vah bijepi ke jariye apni raajnneetik outluk yaa pahchaan ko kisi rashtriya party se jodna chahta he
 Mamata Banerjee has been reduced to a full-fledged regional role and this is a threat to the middle-class base of any regional party
 mamata or left apane gramin aadhaar main itane uljhe or simate hue hai ki gaanv-qasbon se lekar shaharon tak kaa madhyamvarg yaa madhyamvargeey aakanksha vaala tabaqa siyaasi rup se bin maa-baap ke aawaara gum rahaa he
 Non-politicization of this section is creating possibilities for BJP
 iske baavjood trinmul is ladaai ko har din lard rahi he
 After coming to power, the party is now getting the benefit of the opposition's persistence
 sharada jaanch se ghire hone ke baad bhi kolkata main kadam-kadam par mamata banerjee ke hi poster dikhte hai
 Often BJP and Narendra Modi are considered to be the toppers in this matter, but Mamta Banerjee is at the forefront in Kolkata
 gali-gali main trinmul ke jhande dikh jate hai
 Minor meetings of the Trinamool are held every second and third day
 postaron main sthaneey str par kiye gaye kaaryon kii tasveeron ke jhund hote hai
 BJP also has posters, but less in proportion to Trinamool
 poster or jhandon ke lihaaz se shahar main bijepi ladati dikh rahi he
 Each of his attacks is about Sharda, so the Trinamool has also found support in response to Sharda
 nukkadon par trinmul ne bade-bade hording lagaae hai
 Among them, the picture of 'subrata Rai Sahara' jailed has been kept in red circle
 kisi frem main subrat raay sahaara ke saath narendra modi hai to kisi main arun jetali to kisi main ravishankar prasad
 Perhaps due to this fighting tendency, the debaters feel that the Trinamool will not let Bengal go away so easily, but where is the BJP going to give up so easily
 shahar main vivekanand or netaji subhash chandra bose ke postaron kii bharmaar bataati he ki bengal ke chunaav main ye donon mahapurush kaaphi kaam aane vaale hai
 BJP knows how strong Trinamool's land is
 loksabhaa ke modi lahar main bhi trinmul congress ne 33 siten jeet lee thim
 Even then Sharda was scam, but there were not so many arrests
 vidhansabha main bhi trinmul ke 180 se zyaada vidhayak hai
 If the party did not have a strong hold, then it would not have won 165 seats in the assembly by five seats per Lok Sabha
 is tathy ko nazarandaaz nahin kiya ja saktaa
 But now you can not even ignore the truth that BJP has stood up in the debate of 'who is in front of Trinamool'
 2016 main abhi kaaphi vakt he, is lihaaz se pehle paaydaan par jagah milanaa badi baat he
 Then a young man at the tea shop said that i work in a multinational company
 raajnneeti main koi dilchaspee nahin he, lekin narendra modi ko vot kiya
 Why 
 
 ? kyonki main bengal main udyog chahta hum
 i think he will bring the industry
 yuvaaon se kaaphi lambii baat hui
 Cigarettes on a frequent basis said that if not stopped, you cannot reduce them
 
 
 ab to pradhanmantri bhi man kii baat main aap logon se apil kar rahe hai
 
 
 The boys smile, understanding the difference between drugs and tobacco
 maine kaha ki modi sarkaar ke pehle swasthya mantri doctor harshavardhan to cigarette ke khilaaf the to is par bhi chup rahe, shaayad yah unka privet spes he or is maamle main ve raajnneetik dakhlandaazi pasand nahin karte, lekin jaise hi maine unhen bataaya ki kolkata ke bada bazaar main tambaakoo or bidi ke jitne bhi bade vyapaaree hai, sabaki dukaan ke aage bijepi kaa nayaa-nayaa jhanda laga hua he to ladke khilakhilaakar hans pade
 Bengal is debating whether the BJP will come or not
 trinmul ke saamne vipaksh kaa jo vishaal khaali maidan padaa he, use sametane kaa sansaadhan or sanghathan jiske paas he, vah jagah bana legaa
 The BJP has no shortage of resources and organization, the Left is also understanding this very well, when many leftists are coming together like the Janata Parivar, but i do not want to tell the leaders of the slogans and Master Left of posterity
 
 
 
 ho sake to aap bataa dijie ki achche din kaa vaada mamata ne nahin, modi ne kiya he

 dalip trophy ke is match main tendulkar pashchim kshetra or dravid dakshin kshetra kii taraf se khel rahe the
 When Tendulkar landed at the crease in the evening on the first day of the match, Dravid may have been standing at slip, his favorite place of fielding
 dravid ko tab bhi tendulkar ke wicket kii darkaar thi or 20 saal baad unki yahi tamanna he
 In these 20 years however, the world saw Tendulkar and Dravid less as rivals and more as companions
 aakhir 146 test or 245 ek-divasiy maichon main unhone ek duusare kaa saath diya
 In Test matches, 6920 runs were added together

 Whenever they came on the field together in T20, they were the rival of each other

 aakhir 146 test or 245 ek-divasiy maichon main unhone ek duusare kaa saath diya
 In Test matches, 6920 runs were added together
 kinhin do ballebaajon ke bich saajhedaari kaa yah vishwa record he
 Dravid saw Tendulkar score 12586 runs and 40 centuries in Tests
 duusari taraf tendulkar bhi dravid ke 11894 test ranon or 34 shatakon ke gavaah rahe
 Both of them celebrated the victory together in 50 Test matches and there were 44 occasions when they had to forget the loss of each other together
 apane shuruaati varshon main ek duusare ke pratidwandvi ke rup main maidan par utarane vaale tendulkar or dravid pehali baar 28 disambar 1995 ko ek team main khele
 Tendulkar had by then become a big name and was named captain of the india-a team for the Challenger Trophy
 dravid ko unki team main shaamil kiya gaya tha
 Incidentally, Sourav Ganguly was also a part of that team
 is match ke lagbhag teen maheene baad 3 april 1996 ko srilanka ke khilaaf singapore ke pedang main pehali baar tendulkar or dravid ne ek saath bhartiya team kaa pratinidhitiv kiya
 Two and a half months later, both of these veterans also became partners in Test matches against England at the historic Lord's ground
 ek-divasiy antarrashtriya maichon main bhi tendulkar or dravid kii jugalbandi khub dikhi
 The two shared a 4117-run partnership in 98 odis
 inamen 11 shatkeey saajhedaariyaan bhi shaamil hai
 Both of them had added 331 runs for the second wicket against New Zealand on 8 November 1999 in Hyderabad, which is still a world record
 dravid kii maujuudagi main tendulkar ne van-de main 9743 ran ore 28 shatak banaae
 Meanwhile, Tendulkar also saw Dravid scoring 7858 one-day runs and scoring 8 centuries and 63 fifties
 in donon ne chir-pratidwandvi pakistan ke khilaaf sarvaadhik 43 match khele
 Now the final of the Champions League T20 is considered to be the last match in which Tendulkar and Dravid are together on the field
 sanyog dekhie ki cricket ke is chote praaroop main in donon mahaan khilaadiyon ko kabhi ek duusare kaa saathi banane kaa mauka nahin mila
 Whenever they came on the field together in T20, they were the rival of each other
 yah bhi kam dilachasp nahin he ki is baar champions lig kii shuruyaat in donon diggajon kii tiimon ke mukaable se hui or samaapan bhi in donon kii timen kar rahi hai
 Tendulkar retired from IPL last year and IPL earlier this year
 tippaniyan Tendulkar now wants to focus his attention on Test matches
 vah is saal november main westeindies ke khilaaf 200waan test match khelkar nai uplabdhi hasil karenge
 Dravid, who has already said goodbye to international cricket, will probably no longer play competitive cricket
 vah pehle hi iskaa sanket de chuke hai
 Tendulkar and Dravid may be bidding farewell to each other from the cricket ground as rivals, but in 20 years, these two have been face to face with each other only 18 times
 tendulkar jab match ke pehle din shaam ko krij par utre to dravid sambhavat: kshetrarakshan ke apane sabase priy sthaan slip main khadey rahe honge
 Dravid still needed Tendulkar's wicket and this is his wish 20 years later
 in 20 varshon main haalanki duniya ne tendulkar or dravid ko pratidwandvi kam or saathi ke rup main adhik dekha
 After all, they supported each other in 146 Tests and 245 odis
 test maichon main 6920 ran ek duusare ke saath milakar jode
 This is the world record of partnership between any two batsmen
 dravid ne tendulkar ko test maichon main 12586 ran or 40 shatak lagaate hue dekha
 On the other hand Tendulkar also witnessed Dravid's 11894 Test runs and 34 centuries
 in donon ne 50 test maichon main jeet kaa milakar jashn manaaya to 44 aise avasar bhi aae jab unhen ek duusare ke saath milakar haar kaa gam bhulaanaa padaa
 Tendulkar and Dravid played in a team for the first time on 28 December 1995, taking on each other's opponents in their early years
 tendulkar tab tak bada naam ho gaya tha or unhen chalanger trophy ke liye bharat-e team kaa captain banaaya gaya tha
 Dravid was included in his team
 sanyog se saurav ganguli bhi us team kaa hissaa the
 Tendulkar and Dravid together represented the Indian team for the first time in Pedang, Singapore against Sri Lanka on 3 April 1996, almost three months after the match
 iske dhai maheene baad england ke khilaaf aitihaasik lards maidan par ye donon diggaj test maichon main bhi saathi ban gaye the
 Tendulkar and Dravid also had a lot of juggling in one-day internationals
 donon ne milakar 98 van-de main 4117 ran kii saajhedaari kii
 These include 11 century partnerships
 in donon ne newjiland ke khilaaf 8 november 1999 ko hyderabad main duusare wicket ke liye 331 ran jode the jo aaj bhi vishwa record he

 is bich tendulkar ne bhi dravid ko 7858 van-de ran or 8 shatak tathaa 63 ardhshtak lagaate hue dekha
 They both played the most 43 matches against arch-rivals Pakistan
 ab champions lig tii-20 kaa final vah aakhri match mana ja rahaa he jisamen tendulkar or dravid ek saath maidan par virajman rahe
 Incidentally, in this short form of cricket, these two great players never got the chance to become each other's partner
 ve tii-20 main jab bhi ek saath maidan par utre to ek duusare ke pratidwandvi hi rahe
 It is also no less interesting that this time the Champions League started with a match between the teams of these two veterans and the teams of both of them are concluding
 tendulkar pichley saal van-de or is saal ke shuru main ipel se sanyas le chuke hai
 The comments tendulkar ab apana puraa dhyaan test maichon par lagaana chaahate hai
 He will achieve a new feat by playing the 200th Test match against the West Indies in November this year
 antarrashtriya cricket ko pehle hi alavida kah chuke dravid bhi sambhavat: ab aage pratispardhi cricket nahin khelenge
 He has already indicated this

 With a view to curbing black money and promoting cashless transactions across the country, on 8 November 2016, the Modi government announced demonetisation and banned the most driven currency of 500 and 1000 rupees in the economy
 iske saath hi kendra sarkaar ne cashles arthvyavastha ko badhaava dene ke liye bhim aadhaar placeform laanch kiya jiskaa makasad desh main chote kaarobaariyon ko cashles tranjaction ke liye protsaahit karnaa tha
 Due to these efforts, by April 2017, the Central Government identified 75 cities for low cash usage
 haalanki notebandi ke baad desh ke kuch hisson main cash kii killat kaa maamla bhi saamne aayaa or aarthik aankadon main bhi notebandi kaa aanshik asar dekhne ko mila
 But most economists in the country and the world claimed to benefit from demonetisation in the long term

 aap yah jaanakar chowk jaaenge ki ram mandir or puure ayodhya ko ramamay karne ke liye shiya vakf board jitna utsahit he
 Even this much enthusiasm is not seen in the Vishwa Hindu Parishad
 ayodhya ke plan ke liye yogi sarkaar ko shiya central vakf board kaa khulkar saath mil rahaa he
 Shia Central Board President Wasim Rizvi is seen in the color of Ram these days
 tabhi tkheyodhya main lagane vaali bhagwaan ram kii 332 foot oonchi murtike liye jameen or bhagwaan ram ke dhanush ke liye chaandi ke 10 tir dene kii peshkash khud shiya central vakf board ke adhyaksh ne kar daali he
 Along with offering to give land for the idol of Lord Rama, Rizvi said that not only will he give land for the idol but will also give ten silver arrows of Lord Rama's quiver
 jis din se yogi sarkaar ne ayodhya main ramamurti lagane kaa project saamne rakhaa he
 Since that day, the Shia Waqf Board has been offering its participation
 board ke adhyaksh wasim rizvi ne somvaar ko bataaya ki vakf board ke paas bahut si jameen khaali padi he
 If the government wants, we can give land to get the idol of Lord Rama installed
 unhone ye bhi kaha ki ham vakf board kii taraf se murti ke liye chaandi ke das tir bhi daan karenge
 If the waqf and the experts agree, the chairman of the Shia Waqf Board cannot offer to install the idol on behalf of the Waqf and if they do, it can be their personal offering, but neither can it be offered by the Waqf Nor can land be given
 baharhaal aise samay main jab yogi ke ayodhya plan kii aalochana bhi ho rahi he
 The support of the Shia Central Waqf Board is nothing short of a double delight for the Yogi government

 do maheene bitne ke baad bhi 20 lakh pariwaron main se abhi tak keval 300 pariwaron ne ghar vaapasi kii he
 Because, without signing the 'code of Conduct' issued by the Government of Pakistan, the people of the clan cannot return
 darasal, paak sarkaar ne ek 'soshal contract' jari kiya he
 Only after signing it can the people of Northern Waziristan return to their homes
 is contract ke anusaar kabeeley ko logon ko vachan dena hoga ki wo pakistan sarkaar ke prati 'vafaadaar' rahenge
 Apart from this, the clan will also have to take 'responsibility' of the people that it was because of them that the jihadis in the area had spread their feet
 har kabeeley ko bananaa hoga 'kaumi salweshi'sarkaar ne logon ko maathe ye jimmaa bhi madh diya he ki har kabeeley main 40 logon ko ek samooh hoga jo 'kaumi salweshi' ke naam se janaa jayega
 It is the duty of the people of this group to monitor the area and if a terrorist takes shelter in the area, not only will he have to inform the government, but he will also have to make every effort to stop it

 The same Arjun Arya who was nominated by the Samajwadi Party as its candidate from the Budhni assembly seat of Madhya Pradesh in the list of candidates released on Saturday
 lekin mahaj 24 ghante main hi arjuna arya ne apana tikat waapas kar diya he
 Let us tell you that Budhni assembly seat is considered to be the most high profile seat of Madhya Pradesh because the MLA from here is himself Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan
 arjuna arya kaa naam tab charchaa main aayaa tha jab mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ke grih jile sihor main kisaan andolan ke vakt arjuna arya ko police ne giraftaar kar jail bhej diya tha

 Arjun Arya has issued a video on Sunday in which he has sought a ticket from the Congress along with the talk of returning the SP ticket
 video main arjuna ne kaha, 'main congress ke sheersh netritv se kahana chahta hum ki arjuna arya par bharosa karen
 Shivraj Singh Chauhan will contest from whatever corner of Madhya Pradesh and if the Congress presents him as a challenge, then Shivraj will end the government
 'shanivaar ko hi diya tha tiktapako bataa den ki samaajawaadee party ne shanivaar ko hi madhya pradesh kii 6 siton par pratyaashiyon ke naamon kaa elaan kiya tha jisamen se ek seat budhani thi jahaan se arjuna arya kospaane tikat diya tha

 This girl had forced everyone into the past year by accusing her of forcibly converting and raping her
 kaaji jainur raashidin siddikine bataaya ki nikaah se pehle unhone yuvati se poocha ki uske upar kisi tarah kaa dabaav to nahin he

 Former Karnataka Chief Minister BS Yeddyurappa, his two sons and some other family members were acquitted by a special CBI court in various corruption cases on Wednesday
 lekin adaalat ne apane faisle main sibiai kii jaanch par sawaal bhi uthaae or kaha ki vah aarope sabit karne main naakaam rahi
 Yeddyurappa was alleged to have denotified one acre of government land in 2006 as deputy CM, which turned the land into SN Krishnaiah Shetty and later sold the land to Yeddyurappa's sons for Rs 20 lakh
 aarope tha ki unke beton ne farji kagajaat ke aadhaar par jameen liye
 He later sold the land to JSW Steel for Rs 20 crore
 kharid-bikri ko sahi kahacort ne kaha ki jameen ko dinotiphoi 2004 main congress ke shasankaal main hi kiya gaya tha, haalanki, unke baad dharam singh kii sarkaar ne ise cancil kar diya tha
 The court said that the CBI could not prove that Yeddyurappa's sons took the land on the basis of fake documents
 court ne jameen kii bikri ko bhi aasapaas kii or jameen kii kharid-bikri se tulana karte hue sahi bataaya
 Yeddyurappa's sons were also alleged to have shown it less despite having an annual income of more than Rs 2 lakh from the non-agricultural sector, so that they could take plots in the name of farming
 court ne is aarope ko bhi khaarij kar diya or kaha ki 2005-06 se pehle yadiyurppa ke beton kii aay kam thi
 In another land-related case, the court said that the CBI failed to prove that the land was transferred under pressure from Kediyurappa

 At a Gayatri Parivar event in Patna on Sunday, Nitish Kumar himself discussed the point of criticism about himself related to alcohol ban in the state
 unhone kaha ki logon kaa kahana he ki pehle acha vikaas kaa kaam kar rahe the, lekin ab dimag kharaab ho gaya he or aajkal tarah-tarah kii baaten hoti hai
 However, Nitish Kumar also added that he would be criticized further because initially people make fun of every good work, but later people accept it
 nitish ne kaha ki log aalochanaon, virodh ke daur ke baad rajya main sharabbandi ke kaaran samaaj main ho rahe sahi prabhaav ko sweekaar karenge
 But it is clear from Sunday's speech that Nitish is aware of all his criticisms on this issue
 haalanki apane grih jile nalanda main party netaa kii giraftaari ke baad utpaada vibhaag ke adhikari kii giraftaar or is mudde par unki ho rahi aalochanaon par wo kuch nahin bole
 The opposition BJP alleges that to save the leader of its party, Nitish government pressurized the local district administration to prepare the arrest and arbitrary report of the officer of the excise department, but in the coming days it will adversely affect the excise department officials It will affect morale
 tippaniyan However, Nitish again claimed that once his critics visit the rural areas of the state, he will probably get many examples of the good impact on the lives of people after the ban
 lekin nitish ke rukh se saaf he ki philhal is mudde par wo aalochanaon kii parvaah nahin karne vaale

 lekin ravivaar ke bhaashan se saaf he ki is mudde par nitish apni har aalochanaon se vaaqif hai
 However, after the arrest of the party leader in his home district Nalanda, he did not say anything about the arrest of the excise department official and the criticisms being made on the issue
 vipakshi bhaajapa kaa aarope he ki apni party ke netaa ko bachaane ke liye nitish sarkaar ne sthaneey zila prashasan par dabaab daal ke utpaada vibhaag ke adhikari kii giraftaar or manamafik report to taiyaar kara lee lekin aane vaale dinon main iskaa pratikul asar utpaada vibhaag ke adhikariyon ke manobal par padegaa

 But it is clear from Nitish's stand that at the moment he is not going to care about the criticisms on this issue
 haalanki aane vaale dinon main sabko is baat kaa intjaar hoga ki patna hai court is mudde par sunwaayee ke baad surakshit faisale par kya nirnay sunaata he or rajyapal, bihar vidhanmandal se paarit bihar utpaada bill par kya karte hai
