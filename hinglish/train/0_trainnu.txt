 In Himachal Pradesh, Amit Shah said that the BJP government kept the promise of One Rank One Pension within a year
 unhone kaha ki congress ne bhi van rank van pension diya he
 But the OROP of the Congress means only Rahul only Priyanka
 modi ji ne van rank van pension diya sena ke javaanon ko, shahid kii vidhwaa or unhone diya only rahul only priyanka van rank van pension
 The BJP president in Himachal Pradesh made this remark at a time when Congress President Rahul Gandhi has given his sister Priyanka Gandhi the charge of eastern Uttar Pradesh in the party

 Sarabjit Kaur is now 40 years old
 jab 2002 main unase ek saal bade jalandhar ke ek college lekturer gurprit bal ke saath unka vivaah hua tha tab unhone sochaa tha ki unka jeevanasathi mil gaya he
 But this fairy tale came to an abrupt end when Gurpreet Bal suddenly left for Britain in December 2003 without being told
 sarbajit us samay prasav ke baad se apane maayke main thim
 Her baby girl Harpreet Kaur was born in August 2003
 jab sarbajit ne dobaaraa apni sasuraal jane kii koshish kii to unhen lautaa diya gaya
 In 2004, he filed a case of abandonment against the force
 march, 2011 main sarbajit apni fariyaad jalandhar ke kshetreey passport karyaalay main le gayi, jiske aadhaar par bal kaa bhartiya passport radd kar diya gaya
 Sarabjit says that the force is now living illegally in Britain
 ve kahati hai, ‘main maamla sulajhane kii sari ummiden kho chuki hum
 Sarabjit is among the hundreds of women who have been abandoned by their husbands settled abroad
 24 sitambar, 2009 se 30 november, 2011 tak rashtriya mahila ayog ne is tarah kii 796 shikaayatein darj kii hai
 That is, a new complaint is reaching the Commission daily
 in maamalon ko dekhne ke liye ayog ne apravasi bhartiya (enarai) prakoshth banaaya he
 38-year-old Gurmeet Kaur of Khanaura village in Punjab was married on November 22, 2000 to an NRI
 unka pati manjit singh yah vaada karke videsh chalaa gaya ki vah unhen avrajan ke kagajaat bhej degaa
 But he never fulfilled this promise
 baad main gurmeet ko pataa chalaa ki manjit kii shaadi ho gai he or uskaa ek betaa bhi he
 Angrily Gurmeet says, 'not only that, he was not an NRI, he is an unskilled laborer in Seoul
 ’rashtriya mahila ayog or oversij bhartiya maamalon ke mantralay kii ore se sanyukt rup se taiyaar kiye gaye becoground note ke anusaar yah paaya gaya he ki mahilaon ko unke pati yaa to jabaran waapas bhaga dete hai yaa dahej kii maang ke liye bandhak banaakar rakh lete hai
 There are many cases in which no one reached the airport to pick up the victim women when they reached abroad
 agar ye mahilaayein apane bacchon ke saath lautin, to unamem se kuch par apharan ke aarope laga die gaye
 The note states that many of the victimized women found that their husbands had either already been married abroad, or had given incorrect information about their jobs and their immigration status
 ayog kaa note yah bhi kahata he ki kuch patiyon ne ekapaksheeya talaak lene ke liye videshon ke udaar kanoonon kaa laabh uthaaya, taaki unhen bharat main chhod di gai patniyon ko guzaara bhatta na dena pade
 The Women's Commission has received numerous complaints from several countries including the US, UK, Australia, Thailand and UAE that Indian women were abandoned there without proper immigration papers
 india today ko bheje gaye ek likhit patr main mahila ayog ke vidhi adhikari niraj ravat ne bataaya ki praapt shikayaton ke aadhaar par dilli, uttar pradesh, haryana or punjab is aparaadh se sabase zyada prabhavit hai
 Although the instability of the global economy and the easy availability of well-paid young men has made the NRI groom's craze a bit less in recent years, some people still want their daughters to settle abroad
 punjab police main enarai maamalon kii mahanireekshak 44 varshiya gurprit cor dev kahati hai, ‘aisa koi prastaav haath se chhootane na dene kii utsukata main parivaaravale un saadhaaran saavdhaaniyon kii bhi andekhi kar dete hai, jo shaadi karne ke paramparaagat tareekon main barti jaati hai
 'in the last three years, 159 criminal cases have been registered against their husbands who have settled abroad in Punjab in the last three years
 punjab evam haryana hycourt main aisi kai dulahanon kii ore se mukadmaa lard chukin chandigarh kii 42 varshiya vakil dalajit cor kahati hai ki lambey arase se punjabi pashchim se mugdh rahe hai or isi kaaran ve videshon main based duulhon ke liye lalayit rahete hai
 She adds, "apart from this, due to divided holdings, income from farming of many families has decreased
 videshon main based logon kii safalataa ke kisson ke kaaran ve videshon main rishte ke liye lalayit rahete hai
 'former Union Social Welfare Minister Balwant Singh Ramuwalia, who fought the battle of these victims of Punjab (abandoned by her husband), believes that more than 15,000 women have been left in the state by their abroad husbands in the last two decades
 68 varshiya bujurg ramuwalia kehete hai, ‘videshon main based pati maamalon ko lambey se lanbaa khinchakar mahilaon ko thakaa dene kii ranneeti apanaate hai
 In March 2011, the Regional Passport Office of Jalandhar set up a women's cell to look into the cases of these victims
 1967 ke passport adhinium ke kanoonee praavdhaanon ko prayog main laayaa ja rahaa he, taaki un logon ke passport radd yaa baraamad kiye ja saken, jinhone apni vaivaahik sthiti ke bare main galat jaankaree di he yaa jinke khilaaf aapraadhik maamle chal rahe hai
 Till now, orders have been issued for cancellation of passports in more than 50 cases
 lekin aisa aadesh tabhi diya jaataa he, jab peedit mahilaayein vivaah kaa saboot pesh karti hai, jo aise maamalon main bahut hi kam uplabdh ho paata he
 In some cases, the Women's Commission has also been successful
 gurprit cor ko jab unke pati ne bharat main chhod diya, to ayog ne unhen nayaa passport jari karavaaya
 The Commission has also arranged for a non-governmental organization to contest his case in British courts

 ' anna ne lokapal ko lekar jo maangen sarkaar ke saamne rakhi thi, usamen se zyaadaatar nahin maani gai
 Now on 14 and 15 December, Team Anna's core committee meeting will be held on the official draft of Lokpal
 ummid he ki is baithak main anna bhi shaamil honge
 Further strategy will be decided in this meeting
 anna or sarkaar ke bich lokapal bill par maamla lagaataar bigadataa ja rahaa he
 If sources are to be believed, the representatives of the government included in the Standing Committee have rejected most of Anna's demands
 isame pradhanmantri, group si or group di ke sarkari karmchaariyon ke saath nyaaypalika kaa mudda bhi shaamil he
 The battle of Anna Hazare and the government on the Lokpal Bill is getting faster
 standing kamity lokapal bill ke aakhri masaude ko taiyaar karne ke liye maathapai kar rahi he lekin ajtak ko sutron se mili khabar ke mutabik ye draft kai muddon par anna kii maangon ke ulat he yani anna ke kai prastaavon ko khaarij kar diya gaya he
 According to sources, the Standing Committee headed by Abhishek Manu Singhvi has excluded the Prime Minister from the purview of Lokpal
 anna kii maang thi ki lokapal ke daayre main group si or di ke sarkari karmchaariyon ko shaamil kiya jaae, lekin khabaron kii maane to standing cameti ne group si ke 57 lakh karmchaariyon ko bhi lokapal kii nigaraanee se baahar kar diya he
 Anna is demanding that the Nyapalika be brought under the purview of the Lokpal, while sources have suggested that a separate National Judicial Commission has been set up for corruption in Judiciary
 majboot citigen charter bill par bhi anna kii maang par standing cameti kaa zyada tavajjon nahin he
 Anna is demanding to have non-government members in the Lokpal's selection committee, while the government is insisting on keeping government members
 ek taraf anna kaa ultimatum or duusari or standing cameti kaa adiyal rukh
 Obviously, the government will need a lot of effort to prepare the final draft of the Lokpal Bill and when the final draft of the Lokpal is presented, the distress of Team Anna and the government will surely increase

 Released today is 'zanjeer', a remake of the 1973 Amitabh Bachchan starrer 'zanjeer', directed by Apoorva Lakhia
 
 
 rimek 'zanjeer' main mukhya bhoomikaayen nibhaai hai raamacharan teja, priyanka chopra, sanjay dutt, maahi gil or prakaash raaj ne
 
 
 The old 'zanjeer' must have been seen by almost everyone, the story of Inspector Vijay, whose smuggler Teja, ie Ajith, is behind the murder of his parents
 
 
 bas, bachapan se hi inspector vijay ke dimag main yah bhayanak haadasa ghar bana letaa he or use talash rahati he apane mata-pita ke kaatil kii
 
 
 This is exactly the story of the new 'zanjeer'
 
 
 haa, kirdaar badal gaye hai
 
 
 The first thing is that if you look at it as a remake, then this film will disappoint you, because the 'zanjeer' of the year 1973 is like a thick streak that cannot be erased, but if you see the new 'zanjeer' in today's trend If you look like another masala film, then you will come out of the theater by charging money, although the screenplay of this film is also somewhat loose
 
 
 nai 'zanjeer' main ek-duusare ko jodne vaale seens or doylags par dhyaan nahin diya gaya
 
 
 While watching the film, there are tremors, as the scenes reach somewhere
 
 
 doosraa, amitabh bachchan kaa doylaag, "yah police stesan he, tumhaare baap kaa ghar nahin
 
 
 "ramcharan should not have been called, because the original thing is always original
 
 
 tippaniyan At the same time, Sanjay Dutt has not been able to do justice to the character of Sher Khan, but still he will say that Ramcharan has power, if he is not compared to Amitabh Bachchan in this film
 
 
 priyanka chopra kaa kirdaar jaya bachchan ke kirdaar kii tarah maasoom to nahin, lekin chulbula zarur he
 
 
 In the new 'zanjeer', Mala's character does not halt
 
 
 priyanka chopra ko jitna mila, unhone thik-thaak nibhaa diya
 
 
 Prakash Raj should now refrain from doing the same type of roles
 
 
 vah ek achche actor hai, lekin yahaan unhone vahi kiya, jo ham 'wonted' se 'singhm' tak dekhte aae hai
 
 
 One more thing
 
 
 becoground main 'raghupati raghav rajaraam
 
 
 The chorus of 'does not coincide with the subject, nor with the ideology
 
 
 pataa nahin, apurv ne ise kyon istemaal kiya
 
 
 The The action of the film is good
 
 
 film kii gati aapako pakade rahati he
 
 
 You keep seeing on the screen that something is going on
 
 
 agar is film main 'vaah
 
 
 If not a 'factor' then what is it
 
 
 ?' factor bhi nahin he
 
 
 Overall this is an average film, and from my side 'zanjeer' has a rating of - 2
 5 star
 
 
 Just since childhood, this terrible accident builds in the mind of Inspector Vijay and he is looking for the slayer of his parents
 
 
 bilkul yahi kahani he nai 'zanjeer' kii
 
 
 Yes, the characters have changed
 
 
 pehali baat yah he ki agar aap ise rimek kii tarah dekhenge to yah film aapako maayoos karegi, kyonki varsh 1973 kii 'zanjeer' us gadhi lakeer kii tarah he, jise mitaayaa nahin ja saktaa, lekin agar aap nai 'zanjeer' ko aajkal ke chalan main ai ek or masala film kii tarah dekhenge to aap theatre se paisa vasuul karke nikal aaenge, haalanki is film kaa screenple bhi kuch dhilaa he
 
 
 In the new 'zanjeer', the scenes and dialags connecting each other were ignored
 
 
 film dekhte vakt jatke lagate hai, kyonki seens kahin se kahin pahunch jate hai
 
 
 Second, the dialogue of Amitabh Bachchan, "this is the police station, not your father's house
" 
 
 " raamacharan se nahin bulawaanaa chahie tha, kyonki original cheez hameshaa original hi hoti he
 
 
 The comments vahiin, sher khan ke kirdaar ke saath sanjay dutt bhi nyaay nahin kar paae hai, lekin phir bhi yahi kahuunga ki raamacharan main dam he, agar is film main unki tulana amitabh bachchan se na kii jaae
 
 
 Priyanka Chopra's character is not as innocent as Jaya Bachchan's character, but definitely flirtatious
 
 
 nai 'zanjeer' main maala ke kirdaar main vah tehraav nahin he
 
 
 Priyanka Chopra did well as she got
 
 
 prakaash raaj ko ek hi tarah ke rolls karne se ab bachanaa chahie
 
 
 He is a good actor, but here he did what we have seen from 'wanted' to 'singham'
 
 
 ek baat or
 
 
 'raghupati Raghav Rajaram in the background
 
 
 ' kaa kores na vishay ke saath mail khaataa he, na vichaardhaara ke saath
 
 
 Don't know why Apoorva used it
 
 
 ? film kaa ection acha he
 
 
 The pace of the film keeps you occupied
 
 
 aap screen par dekhte rahete hai ki kuch chal rahaa he
 
 
 If in this film 'wow
 
 
 ' factor nahin he, to 'yah kya
 
 
 ? Neither is the factor
 
 
 kul milakar yah ek everej film he, or meri taraf se 'zanjeer' kii reating he - 2
 5 stars

 Union minister Jayant Sinha, who has expressed dissatisfaction over the ticket distribution by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the Bihar assembly elections, has admitted that the party has made mistakes in the selection of candidates, but insisted that only the party will win the election

 On Monday, the Chief Minister of West Bengal did what he had not done for many years
 vah haavda main ek jhuggi basti main gayi, jhonpadiyon main pahunchin, or vahaan rahane waalon se unki samasyaon ke bare main baatcheet kii
 The thing that got him most angry was the arrangement of two toilets for about 400 people living in Puri Basti, the No
 2 round tank in Ward 29
 pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri apni prashasnic baithak ke liye jate vakt is basti main ruk gai thim
 When she arrived at the meeting, she introduced the class of Urban Development and Corporate Affairs Minister Firhad Hakim
 phirahaad hakim ko unke upnaam se sambodhit karte hue unhone kaha, "bobi, aapke vibhaag ko bataaya gaya tha
 
 
 i visited a colony coming here
 
 
 chaar sau parivaar, do shauchalay va gusalakhane
 
 
 Why 
 
 ? ham jhuggi-jhonpadi vikaas ke liye paisa dete hai
 
 
 Who is the councilor 
 
 ? vah kya kar rahe hai
 
 
 ? "there was silence for a few moments
 phir kisi ne mukhyamantri ko bataaya ki sthaneey trinmul parshad june, 2017 se hatya ke aarope main giraftaar he
 But Mamta Banerjee was not deterred by this, and she told Firhad Hakim, "so the councilors are in jail in some case
 
 
 lekin nigam to he
 
 
 He is also the administrator
 
 
 aap apane wordon kii nigaraanee kyon nahin kar rahe hai
 
 
 The i am telling you, within seven days you have to visit all the slums and solve their problems
 
 
 "haavda nagar nigam is vakt ek prashaasak ke tahat kaam kar rahi he, kyonki pichley saal disambar main nirdhaarit chunaav ab tak nahin ho paae hai
 He said with a roar, "what is the problem with building more toilets - at least six or eight -
" 
 
 ? 400 logon ke liye do shauchalay
 
 
 Can you imagine what would have happened if this condition had happened in your home? 
 
 ? agar praavdhaan he, to ham uplabdh kyon nahin karvaa sakate
 
 
 The The civil unit is operating under an administrator
 
 
 aap apana kaam turant shuru kiijie
 
 
 "mamta Banerjee then reached Digha, a popular tourist town located in the eastern Midnapore district, about 200 km from Kolkata
 yahaan bhi unhone routine se hatakar khule main baithna pasand kiya, or unke saath party ke kuch varisht netaa the, or unhone machuaaron se baat kii, unki samasyaayein poochin, or unke bacchon kii padhai ke bare main bhi baat kii
 The media was with him on this tour, but still photographs and a video of his conversation for the media were uploaded to the whatsapp group of Trinamool Congress
 aisa saaf-saaf to nahin dikh rahaa ki yah sab prashanth kishor ke group IPAC kaa idia tha, lekin bhale hi unhone apni marzi se aisa kiya ho, yaa prashanth ke kehane se, yah spasht he ki mamata banerjee khud ko badal rahi hai
 She is now becoming more tender, more anxious and more humane
 gusse or asthirataa ke bina mamata
 
 
 a former MLA who has full details of his voters' birthdays and wedding anniversaries
 ek purv rajyamantri jo hindi par pakad majboot karne se pehle dilli ke taur-tareeke sikh gaya he
 An ordinary member of the royal family who stands in line at airports despite being the Minister of Civil Aviation
 ek purv police ayukta jisane khaaki chhodkar rangeen kurte or ganna kisaanon ke bakaayaa ke bhugtan kaa mudda uthaaya he
 a former army chief, a former home secretary, five former chief ministers, dozens of farmers, businessmen and social workers, lawyers, doctors, teachers, representatives of the entertainment world
 ye sab aapas main bilkul vaise hi alag hai, jaise inke peshey ek-duusare se juda hai
 But they are all tied to politics
 is saal jab bharat ke siyaasi dharaatal kii tasviir badali or teen dashak baad kisi rajnatik dal ko pehali baar spasht bahumat ke saath satta mili, tab yahi netaa rajnatik parivartan ke senaanee hai
 This land of men and women seems to redeem bodies from the past
 16veen loksabhaa ke ye nae-navele saansad na sirf desh kii janata ke dil main uthi badlaav kii lahar kii nishaani hai, balki ve raajnneeti par chaane kii khud kii khwaahish ke bhi pratik hai
 The number 315 is not a record in itself
 1967, 1977 or 1980 main isse kahin adhik saansad pehali baar loksabhaa main chunakar aae the
 Even though the Congress came back to power in 2009, 302 mps were elected for the first time
 baharhaal 2014 kaa chunaav isliye bhi alag he kyonki is baar dilli kii gaddi ko dilli se baahar kaa shaks chunauti de rahaa tha
 Out of these 315, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had emphasized this issue after the election
 badali netagiriapane matadaataaon ke janmdin or shaadi kii saalagirah kaa hisaab rakhane vaale purv vidhayak kaa udhaaharan hi le len
 51-year-old Om Birla has come to Rajasthan from Kota
 teen baar ke bijepi vidhayak birla pehali baar jite saansad ke bare main bani dharanaon se alag hai
 Birla, who started a political career as a student activist of the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha, can be an advisor to many future mps and can teach them one or two tricks to win elections
 booth str par apane chunaav prachaar ke prabandhan main istemaal tareekon kaa zikr karte hue birla kehete hai ki ve aaj bhi janm din, shaadi kii saalagirah or logon kii barsi kaa pataa lagane ke liye iskaa upyog karte hai
 They have to be present on these occasions to stay in touch with their voters
 apane chunaav prabandhan software kii numaaish karte hue birla ne bataaya, ‘‘is databes main mere paas votaron kii sari jaruri jaankaree he or software mujhe nai se nai jaankaree detaa rahata he
 On these occasions i send him a congratulatory message or call or go and wish him well
 isse mujhe apane matadaataaon se behatar sampark rakhane main madad milti he
 But Birla is not a manager turned politician who wins elections on the basis of technology and resources
 asal main ve to khantee rajaneta hai jo neeche se upar aae hai
 He was the national vice-president of the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha till 2003 before contesting and winning the first assembly elections and has now been appointed as the whip of the party in the Lok Sabha
 ve sadan ke naye swaroop kii aadat daal rahe hai jahaan vibhinn samskritiyon se aae sadsy alag-alag bhashaaen bolte hai
 Another new MP who has been successful at the state level is Mohan Kundidaya
 gujarat se bijepi ke 62 saal ke saansad chaar baar ke vidhayak hai or mukhyamantri narendra modi kii sarkaar main mantri rah chuke hai
 Kundaria may have a tight grip in Hindi in Delhi but he is well aware of his new role as an MP
 haai skool tak padhe or kheti ko apana pesha bataane vaale is saansad ne modi sarkaar ke shapathgrahan karne ke kuch hafte baad krishi bhawan main krishi mantri radhamohan singh se mulaakaat kii jo khud chaar baar loksabhaa ke sadsy rahe hai
 He wanted to point out the useless things in the government's agricultural insurance scheme
 vahaan jaakar pataa chalaa ki mantri mahoday ko tab tak is vishay kii puri jaankaree nahin di gai thi
 The election of leaders like Om Birla and Mohan Kundaria gives significant political context to the presence of 315 new mps in the Lok Sabha
 kam-se-kam 122 pehali baar ke saansad vidhayak rah chuke hai yani kareeb 40 fisadi nae saansad chunaav lard chuke hai
 Five of them have been Chief Ministers
 loksabhaa main unka pravesh unki rajnatik yatra main taarkik pragati kaha ja saktaa he
 It is a continuation of change in change
 shahi aam aadamaapane chunaav prachaar main modi ne is ladaai ko upie kii khandaani raajnneeti ko chunauti kaa rang dene kaa ek bhi mauka nahin choda
 Despite this, for the first time at least 95 mps came to elect such close relatives or relatives who are already in politics
 chah nae saansadon kaa sambandh bharat ke rajavaadon se he jo ek alag tarah kii rajnatik viraasat ko aage badha rahe hai or kuch vidwaanon ke khandaani loktantr ke siddhant kii pushti kar rahe hai
 These six new mps of the elite family are Ashok Gajapathi Raju (TDP, Vizianagaram), Mehboob Ali Kaiser (lokjanashakti Party Khagadiya), Nagendra Singh (BJP, Khajuraho), Arka Keshari Singh (BJD, Kalahandi), Hemendra Chandra Singh (BJD, Kandhamal) and Kunwar Sarvesh Kumar (BJP, Moradabad)
 inamen se raju, kaisar, nagendra singh or kunwar sarvesh kumaar ko apane-apane rajyon main acha-khaasaa vidhaayi anubhav he
 Raju was made the Minister of Civil Aviation as soon as he entered national politics
 raju saat baar vidhayak rahe hai or unhone pehla chunaav 1978 main janata party kii ummidavaari par jeeta tha
 Then Telugu Desam Party formed, then joined it
 ve anti ramarao or chandrababu naidu ke mantrimandal main aabkaari, rajasav or vitt mantri rah chuke hai
 There is a general belief that royalty gets aggressive in power, but this king of Vizianagaram has always held himself back
 tidipi kii taraf se modi mantrimandal ke liye manonith kiye jane tak dilli main bahut kam log jaanate the ki ve shahi parivaar ke sadsy hai
 Satyanarayanan, secretary of the Telugu Desam Party Parliamentary Party office, said, "we were pleasantly surprised to find out
 satr ke dauraan ve sadan kii baithak shuru hone se pehle hameshaa sansad main party karyaalay main aate hai or aam kaaryakartaaon, netaaon tathaa mehmaanon se milane ke baad hi apane sansadeey kaary puure karte hai
 This gives evidence of his loyalty to the party
 ’’ raju apane saadhaaran taur-tareekon ke liye surkhiyon main rahe hai jabaki purv naagarik uddyan mantri hawaii addon par ati vishisht vyakti kii suvidha or sammaan paane kii jid kare tab agar maujuuda mantri suraksha jaanch kii qatari main khadaa ho or terminal ke bich tathaa vimaan tak aane-jane ke liye logon ke saath bas main chadhe to kise hairaani nahin hogi
 Raju believes that there should be no restriction on those who want to participate in politics because political parties decide the agenda, not the individuals
 unhone kaha, ‘‘mujhe nahin lagata ki bharat rajwanshi loktantr banegaa
 The election of Narendra Modi as Prime Minister is a proof of this
 ’’dilli or naagarik uddyan mantri tak apane rajnatik safar ko bhi raju khaas ahmiyat nahin dete
 He says, "I was an MLA in Andhra Pradesh for a long time
 aath baar chunaav ladaa or saat baar jeeta
 So, i am not new to the parliamentary process
 fark bas itnaa he ki rajyon kii tulana main yahaan vishay kuch alag hai
 i have been in the government in the state and also in the opposition, so i have seen everything
 ’’(bijepi saansad satyapal singh)khulti khidkiyangar puraane rajpariwaron ke sadsy chunaav main hissaa lekar apana dabadabaa kaayam rakhana chaahate hai, to sarkari naukari karne vaale kuch logon ne bhi raajnneeti main shaamil hokar apana kad badhaane kii koshish kii he
 For the first time elected mps in the Lok Sabha, 15 have been in government service

 singh sabase nami hasti hai
 Both of them had retired before joining the BJP, but Satyapal Singh quit the post of Mumbai Police Commissioner and took voluntary retirement in January and joined the BJP to gracefully enter politics
 satyapal singh ko 2 farvari ko meerut main ek vishaal raily main bijepi main shaamil kiya gaya tha
 The rally was addressed by Modi
 mumbai ke purv police ayukta ne purv pradhanmantri choudhary charan singh ke putr or kendriya mantri ajit singh ko bagpat main haraaya
 The former police chief has taken off his khaki uniform worn for decades and has started wearing colorful kurtas in Parliament and it seems that he takes the proceedings of Parliament seriously
 unhone loksabhaa main dhyanakarshan prastaav ke jariye pashchimi uttar pradesh ke ganna kisaanon ke bakaayaa kaa mudda uthaaya
 Satyapal Singh said, "I have learned how hard it is to be a politician
 dinaraat kaam karnaa padataa he
 He also said that there is much to learn in Parliament
 akasar sabhi dalon ke netaa kaam ke sujhav dete hai
 He believes that former government officials can contribute to the discussion by telling them the tricks of implementing policies and laws
 (bijepi saansad mohan kundadiya)raajnneeti kaa peshaayh bhale hi sanyog ho lekin is chunaav main acchhee-khaasi taadaad main seth bhi loksabhaa main chunakar aae hai
 Modi, the bjp's prime ministerial candidate himself, has reached the chair of power riding on business pro-slogans
 65 pehali baar saansad kaarobaari hai or 68 kathakthith kisaanon ke baad yah doosraa sabase bada samooh he
 New mps like Rabindra Kumar Jena (BJD, Baleshwar), Kesineni Srinivas (TDP, Vijayawada) and Kunwar Harivansh Singh, (apna Dal, Pratapgarh) have little experience in political life
 jena khanan vyavsaayee hai to shrinivas trasamporter hai or harivansh singh real estate kaa kaarobaar karte hai
 Jenna's uncle was in politics
 lekin udyog main kaam karte hue unhone kabhi raajnneeti main aane kii ichha kaa sanket nahin diya
 Started as Trainee in 1990 and in 2011 he was the MD of Baleshwar Alloys Limited
 unka daawa he ki unke saamaajik kaary ko dekhakar bijedy pramukh naveen patnayak ne unhen loksabhaa chunaav main orissa congress ke netaa, kendriya mantri shrikant jena ke viruddh tikat de diya
 Rabindra Kumar Jena defeated the Union minister, but before that the Congress leader made a lot of allegations against him for being involved in the mining scam
 rabindra kumaar jena ne bataaya, ‘‘maine raajnneeti main aane ke bare main kabhi nahin sochaa tha
 When i was not in politics, Srikanth had a good relationship with Jena
 lekin jab unhen pataa chalaa ki mujhe unke khilaaf tikat milegaa to ve mere virdohi ho gaye or aarope lagane lage
 "they also do not deny that some people can resort to political status to advance business interests
" vishleshkon ko kaarobaar jagat ke anubhav vaale logon ke itani badi taadaad main raajnneeti main aane par koi hairaani nahin he
 In his opinion, this shows how much business candidates see in politics
 ashoka vishvavidhyalay main raajnneeti ke sahaayak professor gilis varnears kaa kahana he, ‘‘kai myanon main tikat paane kii hode khud chunavi mukaable se adhik khoonkhaar hoti he
 In most parties, candidates have to pay for their campaign as well as money in party funds
 unhen kai baar to bahut pehle se raajnneeti main pravesh ke liye paisa kharch karnaa padataa he taaki ve rajnatik dalon kii najaron main aa saken
 In such a situation, it is not surprising that so many new players from the business world enter politics
 itane saare purv vidhayakon ke chunaav jeetne par bhi hairaani nahin hoti
 "(TDP MP Kesineni Srinivas) Professional and social service profession and to some extent education world has always been preparing the plant of politics
 lekin is baar 315 main se pehali baar chune gaye 19 nae saansad doctor hai jabaki 31 vakil or 15 shikshak hai
 The entertainment industry has 12 professional representatives, including Kiran Kher, Paresh Rawal, Babul Supriyo and Munmun Sen
 iske ulat sirf saat pehali baar ke saansadon ne raajnneeti ko apana pesha bataaya he
 Actually, politicians like to call themselves social workers or farmers
 is baar 37 pehali baar ke saansadon ne apana pesha saamaajik kaary bataaya he
 The entry of family members, former government officials and professional personnel from family members and royalty has not affected the actions of social workers to politicians or street goers

 There is news of relief for the people of delhi-ncr who are suffering from dengue stings year after year
 is saal dengue kaa tip thri virus active he jo pichley saal active rahe virus tip tu ke mukaable kam khatarnaak he
 aiims's Department of Microbiology, based on the investigation of dengue patients coming to Delhi, found that dengue type two virus is active in Delhi this year due to which dengue outbreak will not be seen in Delhi
 microbiology vibhaag ke doctor lalit dhar ne 'aaj tak' ko bataaya ki pichley 2-3 saalon se dilli main dengue kaa tip tu virus failaa hua tha, jisaki vajah se dengue ke marijon main bleeding or shock syndrome dekhne ko miltaa tha
 But this time the strain of dengue type 3 virus was found in all the cases of dengue
 jisamen marij ko bukhaar to aayega, badan dard or sharir main chakte bhi banenge lekin dengue jaanaleva nahin hoga
 High risk patients will also remain out of danger despite dengue this time
 matlab ye kidengue kii vajahase marij kii maut nahin hogi
 According to Dr
 Dhar, this type 3 virus spreads at the same speed, but it is not aggressive at that level
 isliye yah dilli waalon ke liye raahat kii khabar he
 Dengue viruses are of four types, its fifth type has also come out, but India does not have this virus yet
 dengue ke tip 1, tip 2, tip 3, tip 4 virus main se tip tu virus sabase zyada khatarnaak hota he
 Type 4 viruses also carry the risk of being killed, but type 1 and type 3 viruses are mild, so that there is no risk of death
 doctor dhar ke mutabik tip tu or tip four main khatra zyada hota he, usamen shock syndrome or hemaragic hone kaa khatra zyada rahata he
 In such a situation the patient needs to be admitted
 doctoron ke mutabik beshak dengue kaa virus koi bhi ho lekin logon ko satarkta jarur baratani chahie
 Because if you have suffered from a type of dengue type, then this time you can also be a victim of dengue type 3
 lekin dengue tip 2 se grasit vyakti ko phir se tip 2 dengue nahin hoga
 Let me tell you that last year too, Type-2 virus was active in Delhi due to which 4431 cases were reported in which 206 people died
 unnav or kathua rape cese ne phir se puure desh ko hilaakar rakh diya he
 Thousands of people again took out a candle march at India Gate in the capital Delhi after the Nirbhaya gang rape case which shook the entire country five years ago
 nirbhaya cond ke baad in paanch varshon ke dauraan rape se jude kai kanoonon ko sakht kiya gaya, iske baavjood deshbhar main rape ke maamle kam hone kaa naam nahin le rahe
 Many states have even made punishment-a-death provision for the perpetrators of rape
 lekin ham dekh rahe hai ki kanoon ke sakht karne ke baavjood rape ke maamalon main koi kami nahin aa rahi
 The legal changes that took place after the Nirbhaya incident took place after the strictures following the Nirbhaya scandal
 is jaghanya cond ke teen maah ke bheetar balaatkaar or mahilaon ke yon utpeedan se jude kanoonon kii samiksha kii gai
 And they were made hard by shuffling them
 shaatir naaballigon par shikanjanirbhaya cond ke baad vishesh maamalon main 16 se 18 saal kii umr vaale aparaadhiyon ke khilaaf vayask aparaadhiyon kii tarah cese chalaane kaa faisla liya gaya
 If convicted of rape under the Juvenile Justice Act before the Nirbhaya case, the minor could face a maximum sentence of 3 years
 lekin ab is kanoon main badlaav kar vishesh maamalon main kisi naaballig ko vayask kii tarah sajaa sunai ja sakati he
 Nirbhaya Fund was established after the Nirbhaya Fund was set up by the Central Government
 nirbhaya nidhi main sarkaar ne 1000
 Provided an amount of Rs
 00 crore
 yah fund dushkarm kii peediton or uttarjiviyon ke raahat or punarvaas kii yojana ke liye banaaya gaya tha
 It provides that every state government, in coordination with the central government, will provide funds for the purpose of compensation to victims of crime including rape
 ab tak 20 rajyon or saat sangh shasit pradeshon ne peedit muaavja yojana lagu kar di he
 Despite these changes in the law after the Nirbhaya incident, statistics show that there has been no reduction in the cases of rape
 yahaan tak ki police ke ravaiye main bhi koi badlaav dekhne ko nahin mila he
 Statistics from the National Crime Records Bureau show that there has been an increase in rape cases across the country
 sabase hairaani vaali baat to yah he ki naaballigon ke khilaaf rape ke maamalon main vruddhi hui he

 In such a situation, the Election Commission should take cognizance of the circumstances under which their candidate in Kairana had to support the other candidate before voting and to separate himself from the election

 Obviously, the question will also be in your mind that which plan is better for you? Airtel 198 Plan Actually this is a data centric plan and for this, the customers have to pay 198 rupees
 198 rupee main har din 1GB data milegaa or isaki validity 28 din kii hogi

 kedarnath mandir main puja ko lekar dharm guruon main than gai he
 The war of words has started between Shankaracharya Swami Swaroopananda Saraswati of Dwarkapith and Bhimashankar Linga, the Rawal (chief priest) of the Kedarnath temple
 kedarnath main ai tabaahi ke baad mukhya pujari bhimashankar ling kedarnath ke chal vigrah ko lekar guptkashi ke ukhi math le aae
 At the same time, he is worshiping Kedarnath
 rawal ke mutabik mandir parisar main kai shraddhaluon kii maut hone se sthaan apavitra ho gaya he
 Worship cannot be started here without purification
 udhar, swami swaroopanand kaa kahana he ki jab bhagwaan shiv khud maraghat main nivas karte hai to phir bhakton ke marane se mandir apavitra kaise ho saktaa he
 Therefore, following the tradition, worship should be done in the Kedarnath temple itself till the closing of the kapat in winter
 bhagwaan ko ukhimath le jane se swaroopanand itane khafa hai ki unhone rawal ko pad se hataane kii maang kar daali
 Shankaracharya is not entitled to worship
 Bhimashankar Linga retorted that Shankaracharya and his disciples did not have the right to worship Kedarnath
 aadi shankaracharya ne yah parampara banaai thi ki kedarnath or badrinath kaa mukhya pujari namboodiri brahman hoga
 Adi Guru Shankaracharya was also from this family and he built the Badrinath and Kedarnath temples
 swami swaroopanand saraswati chunki namboodiri brahman nahin hai isliye unka aadi shankaracharya se koi sambandh nahin he
 Vasudevanand, who came in support of Rawal, also jumped in this charge-counter, Shankaracharya Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati of the astrologer Badrikashram
 unhone rawal ke faisle ko bilkul sahi bataaya he
 He said that puja is done in Ukhi Math in winter, so it should be worshiped there in emergency
 unke mutabik, samiti jis tarah se ukhi math main puja kara rahi he vah shastranukool he
 Vasudevananda said that even Swami Swaroopananda had raised a dispute about the establishment of Chatushpad in Mahakumbh
 kab shuru hogi pujaais bich, sabaki nazren is par tiki hai ki mandir main puja kab shuru hoti he
 However, given the circumstances of Kedarnath, it does not seem possible at the moment

 bhartiya captain viraat kohli brake se pehle newjiland ke khilaaf somvaar ko mount maaunganui main hone vaale tisare vanade international match main jeet ke saath paanch maichon kii siries main ajey badhat hasil karne ke iraade se utrenge
 The BCCI has given the Indian captain a rest after the third ODI to ease Kohli's burden and would like him to end his campaign with a win after winning the first Test and One Day International bilateral series in Australia
 bharat agar kal jeet ke saath 3-0 kii ajey badhat hasil kar letaa he, to yah 2014 main newjiland main hui vanade siries main haar kaa badla hoga jab team india ne siries 0-4 se ganvaai thi
 All eyes will be on the inclusion of Hardik Pandya in the third ODI team
 tivi sho 'coffee vid karan' ke dauraan mahilaon par kaamuk tippanee ke baad hardik ko asthai nilamban kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha, jiske baad yah olerounder team main vaapasi kar rahaa he
 India vs New Zealand Live Streaming: When and where to watch The third ODI captain has accepted that Hardik's presence gives strength and balance to the team
 hardik ke vikalp vijay shankar upyogi cricketer hai, lekin unamem baroda ke olerounder jaisaa ‘eks factor’ nahin he
 Vijay Shankar was bowled just two overs in the second ODI, indicating that he is still not ready to take on additional responsibility
 vijay shankar kii tulana main hardik tej gati se gendbaaji kar sakate hai
 In the three odis played by Vijay Shankar, he failed to catch the batsmen with his bowling
 pandya chathe number par ballebaaji karne main sakasham hai or bich ke overon main ran jutaney main unki bhoomika ahm ho sakati he jaisaa ki captain chaahate hai
 Apart from this, there does not seem to be much change needed in the Indian team
 duusari taraf newjiland kii team kuldeep yadav or yujavendra chahal kii bharat kii kalai kii spin jodi ke saamne ab tak post najar ai he
 Both of them have taken 12 wickets out of 20 in the first two odis
 kuldeep adhik ghaatak najar aae or pehle do vanade main aath wicket hasil kar chuke hai
 He took four wickets in both the matches while Chahal took two wickets each
 newjiland police kaa mjedaar coment- kohli or team india kii maar se bachanaatej gendbaaj bhubaneshwar kumaar or mohammad shami ne bhi acha pradarshan kiya he or team ke liye ahm maukon par wicket hasil kiye hai
 Indian batsmen played well with the bowlers in both the matches
 shikhar dhawan kii form main vaapasi se bharat ke top order ko majbootee mili he
 Dhawan scored an unbeaten 75 in the first ODI and a 66-ball 67 in the second match
 pehle vanade main vifal rahe up-captain rohit sharma ne duusare match main 87 ran kii pari kheli or apane salaami jodidar dhawan ke saath 14veen baar shatkeey saajhedaari kii
 Captain Kohli also looked in good rhythm in both the matches while Ambati Rayudu smashed a 49-ball 47 in the second ODI on Saturday

 The team's batting looks strong, but the fifth bowler may create some concern for the visiting team and here Hardik's role can be important
 ICC ne PAK captain sarfaraj ko kiya bain, africa khilaadi ko kaha tha 'kaala'bharat ne world cap se pehle apane middle order ko antim rup nahin diya he
 After the third ODI, when Kohli takes a break, Dinesh Karthik could get a place in the middle order in the absence of the captain
 team prabandhan shubhaman gil ko bharat kii ore se debyue karne kaa mauka bhi de sakati he
 Captain Kane Williamson was the top scorer for New Zealand in the first ODI while in the second match, he was in rhythm while spending brief time at the crease

 rashtriya pustak nyaas ke sahyog se pragati maidan main lage vishwa pustak mela 2019 main lekhak manch par 'sahitya ajtak' kaa aglaa satr tha dow
 Discussion on Saurabh Malaviya's book 'the pinnacle of nationalist journalism - Atal Bihari Vajpayee'
 jahaan said ansaari se baatcheet ke liye maujuud rahe pan maakhanlaal chaturvedi rashtriya patrakarita vishvavidhyalay ke praadhyaapak or is kitaab ke lekhak dow
 Saurabh Malaviya
 satr ke shuru main said ne malviya kii raajnneetik or saamaajik samaj kii tarif karte hue poocha ki kis tarah vah atal bihari vaajapeyi ko ek patrkaar or vah bhi ek rashtravaadi patrakarita ke shikhar purush ke rup main dekhte hai
 Dr
 saurabh malviya ne 'sahitya ajtak' kaa aabhaar jataate hue, 'tera tujko arpan' kii baat kahi or kaha ki desh or samaaj ne hamako jo diya hamane use vahi lautaaya
 Atal Bihari Vajpayee was the great hero of this thinking
 meraa maananaa he ki raajnneeti ek aisi vidha he, ek aisa kshetra he, jo kisi bhi samaaj ke vikaas kii prakriya ke liye bahut mahatvapurn mana jaataa he
 But the misfortune is that after independence the vision of looking at politics was narrowed
 raajnneeti main kaam karne vaala vyakti, netaa banane vaala vyakti samaaj main us tarah se nahin sweekaar kiya gaya, jaise ki ham chaahate hai ki hamaare bachche pard kar doctor bane, vakil bane, ejeeniyar bane par koi vyakti yah nahin kahana chahta ki main rajaneta hum
 In response to such questions, the name of the person who gave his full age was Atal Bihari Vajpayee
 vishwa pustak mela 2019: meley main kahaan kya he, yahaan pard sakate hai puri detechtal bihari vaajapeyi janmajaat vaktaa the, janmajaat kavi hriday the, patrkaar the, prakhar rashtravaadi the
 It was said about him that if he had fought elections from Pakistan, he would have won from there too and would have been called the leader of Pakistan
 raajnneeti ko jab prashnon ke daayre main khadaa kiya ja rahaa he tab atal ji kii sweekaaryata jan-jan main thi
 Ram Manohar Lohia, Jai Prakash Narayan, Namboodiripad, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Deen Dayal Upadhyay, Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru were all such leaders who first decided that we need independence, development of the nation
 in sabane raashtra ko sarvopari rakhaa
 In explaining nationalist journalism, Dr
 saurabh malviya ne kaha ki iskaa arth he samaaj ke sabhi virgon ko, samaaj main nichle str par jeene vaale har vyakti ko sabhi sansaadhan uplabdh karaane main apana sarvasv jivan nichhaavar kar dena
 Atal Bihari Vajpayee gave up his life for this reason
 isiilie is kitaab ko likhane kii jarurat padi
 Atal Bihari Vajpayee was not just a leader
 unki sabhaayen desh bhar main hoti thim, to duusare dalon ke netaa bhi unka bhaashan ek netaa ke taur par sunne jate the, kisi dal ke netaa vishesh ke taur par nahin
 World Book Fair 2019: Where is in the fair, you can read here the entire detail of Bihari Vajpayee's journalism was very young
 vah aaj kii patrakarita se alag thi
 There was ideological journalism in newspapers of the time
 atal ji jitne bhi patrapatrikaon se jude rahe unhone apane chote vaicharik lekhon, sampadakeey se bhi apni vishisht chhap chodi
 The mind becomes astonished after reading them
 mela, rashtriya ekta, bhashaa, hindi bhashaa par unke adbhut lekh hai
 On today's journalism, Dr
 saurabh malviya kaa kahana tha ki pehle kii patrakarita main raashtra sarvopari he
 After independence from slavery, any country is broken
 bharat kii sthiti bhi usase alag nahin thi
 But today's journalism is people oriented
 aaj kii patrakarita janajagriti kii patrakarita he
 You can no longer hide things
 aaj ek cheez bade sankat main he ki patrkaar pakshakaar ban gaya he
 And when the journalist becomes a party, the country and the media will face challenges
 iskaa samaadhaan janata or media ko khud karnaa hoga
 Despite being an ideological commitment, Atal Bihari Vajpayee did not let it dominate his journalism
 har media gharaane main na sahi par har patrkaar apane windo time main kahin na kahin apane vichaaron ko le hi aata he
 Referring to Lohia, Gandhi, Nehru and Atal, he accused prime-time journalists that they had become parties
 isiilie patrakarita ko rashtrawaad se jodne kii baat is kitaab main kii gai
 How can journalists call those who have problems with the word nationalism, while the truth is that when no one listens, it comes to the media door
 aapako kahin nyaay na mil rahaa ho to aap patrkaar ke paas jaaie vahaan nyaay milegaa, kyonki patrkaar dard se jeeta he, lekin duusare ke dard ko peetaa he
 The life of a journalist is like a candle, burning til mole and lighting others
 jahaan yah manobhaav he vahaan, rashtrawaad or rashtravadita se virodh kyon
 Look at Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi, Makhanlal Chaturvedi
 hamaari patrakarita kaa pind he rashtrawaad

 jiesti yani bharat ke sabase bade kar sudhaar par sanvaidhanik auditor niyantrak evam mahalekha pareekshak (sieji) kii nigahabaani nahin hogi!yadi sansad ne dakhal na diya to sieji jiesti se centre va rajyon ko hone vaale nuksaan-phaayde par sawaal nahin uthaa paaegaa!dow
 Ambedkar had said that the CAG is a more important institution than the Supreme Court
 ise centre or rajyon ke rajasav ko pramanit karne kaa sanvaidhanik adhikaar he magar ise jiesti main rajasav ko lekar suchanaaen maangane kaa adhikaar bhi nahin milane vaala
 When do state governments also want someone to monitor them
 kya yah pichhali sarkaar main sieji kii sakriyata se upja dar he?yaa phir sanvaidhanik sansthaaon kii bhoomika simit karne kaa koi bada aayojan?jiesti sarkaron (centre va rajya) ke rajasav se sambandhit he, jo audit ke sanvaidhanik niyamon kaa hissaa hai
 On this basis, the CAG investigated 2G and coal scams as the revenue from them came to the government treasury
 jiesti kanoon ke praarambhik praaroop kii dhara 65 ke tahat sieji ko yah adhikaar tha ki vah jiesti council se suchanaaen talab kar saktaa he
 In October last year, an exercise to quietly remove this provision began under the leadership of the central government
 sieji ne patr likhakar anurodh kiya tha ki dhara 65 ko na hataaya jaae kyonki sanvaidhanik niyamon ke tex maamalon kaa audit sieji kii jinmmedaari he
 However, in the latest meeting of the GST Council, the Center and the state agreed to keep the CAG away from GST
 is faisle ke baad centre va rajyon ke rajasav main sanvaidhanik auditor kii bhoomika behad simit ho jaaegi
 Doubts abound as to why governments want to keep CAG out of GST
 jabaki jis formule ke tahat rajyon ko jiesti se hone vaale nuksaan kii bharpai karegi, uske rajasav ke aankadon ko pramanit karne kaa adhikaar sieji ke paas he
 The dispute is also about the GST network, which the CAG is not getting permission to audit
 yah network ek nijee company (51 fisadi hissaa bainkon va vittiya companiyon kaa or 49 fisadi sarkaar kaa) ke maatahat he jo centre va rajyon ke tex system ko jodgaye vaala vishaal computer network banaaegi va chalaaegi, kar jutaayegi or rajasav kaa bantwaaraa karegi
 In this company, the Central and State Governments Rs 4,000 crore
 laga chuki hai
 The Finance Department's expenditure department is questioning it
 jiesti kaa network bana rahi ek company par sarvice tex chori kaa maamla bhi bana he, alabatta vitt mantralay is network ke sieji audit ko taiyaar nahin he
 Not surprisingly, the Finance Minister, while declaring to keep the CAG away from GST, referred to the Income Tax Act, where the CAG has not got special rights
 inakam tex ko lekar to sieji or sarkaar ke bich ek jang si chhidi he jo surkhiyon kaa hissaa nahin banati
 The CAG corridors recall stories of the last years of Ndrabbe's decade when the government came out with the Voluntary Income Declaration Scheme (VDIS) and the Finance Ministry did not allow its audit
 tab baqayada auditor ne iskar adhikariyon ke khilaaf police main shikaayat kii thi
 The situation is similar at this time also
 sieji taaja inakam discloger skim kaa audit karnaa chahta he lekin vitt mantralay taiyaar nahin he
 The Finance Ministry does not give income tax figures due to limited CAG powers in the Income Tax Act, which is drawn every year
 yakeenan, pichley do saal main sieji ne koi bada chankane vaala audit nahin kiya (karne nahin diya gaya) he lekin iske baad bhi teen maukon par sieji ne sarkaar ko asahaj kiya haih pehla, jab sieji ne alpiji silendar chhodie kii yojana se 22,000 karod ru
 The savings claim was proved to be hollow
 doosraa, jab sieji ne koyala block nilaamee main chhed paae the
 Third, the Gujarat government (2005) investment in the KG basin was questioned
 ambedkar sieji ko sangheey vittiya anushaasan ridh banane ja rahe the isliye samvidhan sabha ne lambii bahes ke baad rajyon ke liye alag-alag sieji banane kaa prastaav nahin mana
 They wanted that the government should not even have the right to appoint the staff of the CAG, but now the constitutional scale of transparency has also started to scare the governments, especially those who are very much scared, who are clean and honest politics

 austrailia kii sabase ghani aabaadi vaale shahar sidney main bangaleru kii ek mahila iti export apni duty puri karne ke baad ghar laut rahi thi
 After landing from the metro, he had to walk 300 meters to reach the house
 paidal chalate hue vah apane pati ko bangaleru main phone milaati he
 Both are talking on the phone
 tabhi achaanak pati ko phone par patni kii cheekh sunai detii he
 This was his last scream
 sidney main shanivaar raat 9:30 baje chuke the
 41-year-old Prabha Arun Kumar, a resident of Bangalore, was returning to her home after doing a double shift at the office
 metro se utarane ke baad unhen sidney ke paramatta ilaake ke public walk-ve se guzarana tha
 In the walkway's CCTV camera, it is clear that Prabha is talking to someone on her mobile on foot
 duusari taraf phone par koi or nahin balki sidney se hajaaron mile dur bangaleru main rahane vaale unke pati ji arun kumaar hai
 Prabhay was Prabha's routine every day
 wo jab bhi daftar se ghar lautatin to raste main apane pati se phone par baatcheet jarur karti
 Prabha came for a short time under CCTV cameras
 iske baad unhen apane ghar tak jane ke liye ek park ko paar karnaa tha
 Usually, there is silence in this park at night
 par prabhaa jaise hi walk ve se nikalati hai unhen ahsaas hota he ki koi unka peechha kar rahaa he
 Since she is constantly talking to her husband in Bangalore on the phone, she tells this thing to her husband
 iske baad agle kareeb ek minute tak or phone on rahata he or phir sidney se hajaaron mile dur bangaleru main prabhaa ke pati ko prabhaa kii aakhri cheekh sunai detii he
 After this, the phone is suddenly cut off
 hatyare ne chaaku se kiya hamalaadobaraa prabhaa kaa phone kareeb teen ghante baad on hota he
 Then in Bangalore, Prabha's husband learns that while she was talking to him on the phone, at the same time, someone attacked him with a knife and killed Prabha
 usee park main jis park se hokar wo ghar ja rahi thi
 The murder of an Indian IT expert in the Paramatta area of sydney scares everyone from Australia to India
 pehali najar main yahi lagata he ki katl lutpaat kii vajah se hua
 But after some time it becomes clear that the matter is not about looting
 to phir prabhaa kaa katl kyon hua?sidney police kaa kahana he ki jis vakt prabhaa ke saath ye vaardaat hui, wo apane work place yani mindtri naam kii company se nikal kar apane ghar laut rahi thi
 She landed at Paramatta railway station at around nine in the night and passed through the public walkway of Argael Street
 aage chal kar wo jaise hi footpath se hoti hai apane ghar kii taraf badi tabhi park main usapar hamalaa ho gaya
 The distance from this park to his house is only 300 meters
 hamalavar ne nahin kii lutapatvaardaat ke vakt prabhaa ke paas mobile phone or cash bhi tha
 But the attacker did not take anything away
 wo bas aayaa or prabhaa kii gardan par ek ke baad ek tejadhaar hathiyaar se hamalaa kar bhaag gaya
 Though Prabha was still alive after her escape
 seene, gale or jism ke kai duusare hisson main chaakuon ke waar se buree tarah zakhmi prabhaa footpath par hi gir gayi or cheekhney lageen
 Meanwhile, someone caught sight of Prabha suffering on the road and was immediately taken to the hospital
 lekin aadhi raat ko ilaaj ke dauraan hi prabhaa kii maut ho gai
 Now the question is, who did this attack on Prabha? What was the purpose of this attack? Why did the attacker want to kill him? If he only intended to rob Prabha, then why did he badly hurt Prabha with knives? Is this a matter of color discrimination? The police and detective teams of Paramatta Local Area Command and State Crime Command Homicide Squad are seeking answers to these questions
 'ek lanbaa-chaudaa insaan mere saamne khadaa he'bangaleru se kareeb 14 hajaar kilometre dur sidney main jab prabhaa kaa katl kiya ja rahaa tha tab uskaa pati un aakhri palon kii har baatcheet, jaan baksh dene kii guhaar or phir aakhri cheekh sab kuch live sun rahaa tha
 But he was helpless
 kuch kar nahin saktaa tha
 But according to what Prabha told during the conversation, whatever the attacker was, he was very tall and not the least robber
 wo prabhaa ko maarane hi aayaa thatin saal pehle bengaluru se sidney pahunchi prabhaa yun hi aksar apane pati se baat karti hui ghar lautati thim
 
 
 But what happened to Prabha everyday was very strange
 abhi prabhaa arun ke saath phone par connected hi thim ki aachanak prabhaa ke sur badal gaye
 She left her husband and started talking to a strange person standing in front of him
 usne kaha, 'pleez mujhe mat maaro
 
 
 leave me
 
 
 mere paas jo kuch he, tum le lo
 
 
 But let me go
 'ye baatcheet tab phone line par maujuud arun live sun rahe the
 He got nervous after listening to the conversation
 par itani dur se kuch kar bi nahin sakate the
 Just kept intercepting Prabha on the phone and kept asking her what happened
 
 
 kya ho rahaa he?
 But from the other side, Prabha was able to say that 'A tall and wide person is standing in front of me
 'phir isse pehle ki prabhaa unhen kuch or bataatin, agle hi pal arun ne jo kuch suna wo behad daraavna tha
 Prabha, who was begging in front of Ajbani, was now just screaming out of his mouth
 iske baad prabhaa ne arun se jo aakiri baat kahi, wo thi, 'mujhe lagata he ki mujhe chaaku maar diya he
 'and shortly thereafter, Prabha's phone disconnected
 apni patni se itani dur phone par uski chiken sun kar arun buree tarah ghabara gaye
 He tried to call Prabha's phone after calling him and his friends
 lekin unhen isamen koi kamyaabi nahin mili
 During this time, he kept trying to talk to his peers in Sydney
 lekin takreeban aadhe ghante baad unhen prabhaa ke kisi kulig ne sidney se phone kiya or phir iske baad usee kulig ne sidney police ko prabhaa ke bare main khabar di
 He was rushed to the hospital, but did not survive, an eyewitness had already told the police after seeing Prabha suffering
 fouran mauka-e-vaardaat par pahunch kar police ne buree tarah zakhmi prabhaa ko aspataal pahunchaaya or suraag ikattha karne ke iraade se krime seen kii gheraabandi kar di
 But before the police could find anything about Prabha's attacker, Prabha died while undergoing treatment in the hospital at 12
45 pm
 bengaluru main prabhaa ke pati arun ke alaava unki das saal kii ek beti bhi he
 Arun left for Australia immediately after getting information about this attack on his wife
 philhal, sidney police ne is maamle kii tafteesh ke liye ek khaas team banaai he
 According to Sydney police, it is clear from the initial investigation that the case is not of robbery
 kyonki hamalavar ne prabhaa kaa koi saamaan nahin lutaa
 And the way he attacked it was clear that he had come to kill Prabha
 kaatil or katl ke makasad tak pahunchane ke liye police ne prabhaa ke ghar se tamaam jaruri dastavej apane kabje main le liye hai
 So that it can be ascertained that in recent times there was no problem with anyone in his enmity or relationships

 On Friday, four senior judges of the Supreme Court come out and say in front of the press that 'there are many intelligent people in this country who keep talking judiciously
 ham nahin chaahate ki ye budhimaan log 20 saal baad ye kahen ki justise chelameshwar, gogoi, lokur or courian joseph ne apni aatma bech di or samvidhan ke hisaab se sahi kadam nahin uthaaya
 ' chaar jaj kahen ki ham nahin chaahate ki koi aise yaad kare ki inhone apni aatma bech di or ham bahes unke uthaae sawaalon par nahin kar rahe hai
 Putting aside the questions of the honorable judges, TV media and social media began to discuss what their family background is, why they held press conferences, why they did not go to the President and why they did not talk to the Chief Justice
 yahi nahin, soshal media par un logon ke dwaara abhadra shabdon kaa istemaal kiya gaya jinhen desh ke sanvaidhanik padon par baithe log follow karte hai
 On the other hand, injustice was also done to the Chief Justice

 Now come to hear about CBI Judge Loya's case
 is maamle main bhi jamkar vivaad hua he
 On Sunday, Judge BH Loya's son Anuj Loya and his lawyer held a press conference
 anuj ne kaha ki unhen apane pita kii maut par koi shaq nahin he
 There should be neither investigation nor politics
 ek vivaad uthaa ki anuj ne apane video main is press conference ke liye amit shah se baat kii thi
 Whatsapp University is running in many places
 yah puri tarah se jhooth he
 a person sitting with Anuj Loya said that we spoke to Amit sir
 unhone paas baithe vakil amit nayak ko amit sar kaha tha na ki amit shah ko
 Beware of false facts irrespective of party
 20 november ko jaj loya ke maamle kairavaan patrika main pehali baar khabar chhapi thi tab jaj loya kii doctor bahan kaa video bayaan bhi jari kiya tha
 You yourself remember which channel showed that statement
 kis kis ne us story ko follow kiya or kisne chuppi maar lee
 Were they scared then who are becoming brave now
 acha kar rahe hai ki anuj loya ke bayaan ko pramukhataa se dikhaa rahe hai lekin kya ve is story ke saath chape sandarbh, dastavezon kii bhi baat kar rahe hai, ve nahin karenge kyonki bahuton ko ab media main dar lagane laga he
 Between 20 November and 14 January, Caravan magazine published ten articles related to Judge Loya's death
 un khabaron main sirf parivaar waalon kaa bayaan nahin tha balki kai saare sawaal or dastauez bhi the
 Most of them kept quiet on the channel
 kisi channel par anuj kii doctor buaa kaa sawaal nahin chalaa, magar anuj kaa bayaan chal rahaa he
 Now the story is being dismissed through this
 kairavaan patrika ke sampadak haratosh singh bal abhi bhi apni story par kaayam hai or jaanch kii maang kar rahe hai
 The comments kairavaan ne apni story main bataaya tha or saboot dikhaaya tha ki 2015 main anuj loya ne apane pita kii maut kii jaanch kii maang kii thi or jaan ko khatara bataaya tha
 Now why are they saying that no doubt, they can tell better
 kairavaan kii story aane ke baad 29 november ko times of india main khabar chhapati he ki anuj loya ne bombai hoicourt ke chif justise se milakar kaha ki parivaar ko koi shikaayat nahin he
 Then why on that day all the news channels did not show enthusiasm towards this news or about Anuj Loya's statement
 kyon chup rahe gaye, kya kahin chunaav chal rahaa tha isliye
 Whether India's democracy is in danger or not, the media is definitely at risk
 kiske ishaare par kab koun bol rahaa he, kab chup ho ja rahaa he, ab khabar se zyada iskaa pataa rakhie
 The Congress party has demanded an inquiry into the death of Judge Loya
 shuukravaar ko supreme court ne jaj loya ke maamle ko gambhir bataaya tha
 On 16 January, the Maharashtra government has to answer in this case
 8 janvari ko bombai loyr sangh ne hoicourt main yachika lagaai he ki maamle kii jaanch kii jaae
 So what was resolved in the Supreme Court
 jo do maheene kii chitthee se nahin sulajhaa wo chaay par kaise sulajh gaya
 If the country finds out the problem, should the country not know the solution
 chaar jaj kahen ki ham nahin chaahate ki koi aise yaad kare ki inhone apni aatma bech di or ham bahes unke uthaae sawaalon par nahin kar rahe hai

 anuj ne kaha ki unhen apane pita kii maut par koi shaq nahin he
 There should be neither investigation nor politics
 ek vivaad uthaa ki anuj ne apane video main is press conference ke liye amit shah se baat kii thi
 Whatsapp University is running in many places
 yah puri tarah se jhooth he
 a person sitting with Anuj Loya said that we spoke to Amit sir
 unhone paas baithe vakil amit nayak ko amit sar kaha tha na ki amit shah ko
 Beware of false facts irrespective of party
 20 november ko jaj loya ke maamle kairavaan patrika main pehali baar khabar chhapi thi tab jaj loya kii doctor bahan kaa video bayaan bhi jari kiya tha
 You yourself remember which channel showed that statement
 kis kis ne us story ko follow kiya or kisne chuppi maar lee
 Were they scared then who are becoming brave now
 acha kar rahe hai ki anuj loya ke bayaan ko pramukhataa se dikhaa rahe hai lekin kya ve is story ke saath chape sandarbh, dastavezon kii bhi baat kar rahe hai, ve nahin karenge kyonki bahuton ko ab media main dar lagane laga he
 Between 20 November and 14 January, Caravan magazine published ten articles related to Judge Loya's death
 un khabaron main sirf parivaar waalon kaa bayaan nahin tha balki kai saare sawaal or dastauez bhi the
 Most of them kept quiet on the channel
 kisi channel par anuj kii doctor buaa kaa sawaal nahin chalaa, magar anuj kaa bayaan chal rahaa he
 Now the story is being dismissed through this
 kairavaan patrika ke sampadak haratosh singh bal abhi bhi apni story par kaayam hai or jaanch kii maang kar rahe hai
 The comments kairavaan ne apni story main bataaya tha or saboot dikhaaya tha ki 2015 main anuj loya ne apane pita kii maut kii jaanch kii maang kii thi or jaan ko khatara bataaya tha
 Now why are they saying that no doubt, they can tell better
 kairavaan kii story aane ke baad 29 november ko times of india main khabar chhapati he ki anuj loya ne bombai hoicourt ke chif justise se milakar kaha ki parivaar ko koi shikaayat nahin he
 Then why on that day all the news channels did not show enthusiasm towards this news or about Anuj Loya's statement
 kyon chup rahe gaye, kya kahin chunaav chal rahaa tha isliye
 Whether India's democracy is in danger or not, the media is definitely at risk
 kiske ishaare par kab koun bol rahaa he, kab chup ho ja rahaa he, ab khabar se zyada iskaa pataa rakhie
 The Congress party has demanded an inquiry into the death of Judge Loya
 shuukravaar ko supreme court ne jaj loya ke maamle ko gambhir bataaya tha
 On 16 January, the Maharashtra government has to answer in this case
 8 janvari ko bombai loyr sangh ne hoicourt main yachika lagaai he ki maamle kii jaanch kii jaae
 So what was resolved in the Supreme Court
 jo do maheene kii chitthee se nahin sulajhaa wo chaay par kaise sulajh gaya
 If the country finds out the problem, should the country not know the solution
 kisi ne kaha ki sipiai netaa di raja kyon milane gaye, to kisi ne usee jor se nahin poocha ki pradhanmantri ke pradhan sachiv chif justise se kyon milane gaye
 Whereas both these things were not so important to an extent that the question of discrimination on the formation of the Bench should be sidelined
 do maheenaa pehle chif justise ko likhe patr par bhi aadhi adhuri charchaa hui
 You decide what was happening deliberately and not deliberately
 akhir ham us par baat kyon nahin kar sakate ki jajon ne kya kaha or use thik karne ke liye kya kiya ja saktaa he
 The Bar Council of India took the initiative in this matter and met 16 judges from Saturday to Sunday night
 baar council of india kaa kahana he ki raajnneetik dal isse dur rahen or media ne bhi kuch atakalein failaayin jo uchit nahin thi
 On Monday morning, the Attorney General informed that all the judges were present at the tea meeting and the matter was resolved
 acchhee baat he
 But the matter was related to the formation of a bench for the hearing of the case and the memorandum of procedure, there is no concrete information on what happened
 ummid kii ja sakati he ki kisi sahi vakt par supreme court desh ko batayega ki kis tarah se maamla sulajhaa liya gaya, kya prakriyaayein bani hai yaa banane vaali hai jisase logon ko santhaan main bharosa or behatar ho
 Many articles have been written in newspapers and websites regarding this episode, which you can read in the spare time
 isse aap nyaaypalika ke bheetar kii prakriyaaon, naitikta, kanoonee praavdhaan in sabake bare main jaan sakenge

 If you can read, then search on the internet and definitely read
 harprit singh gyani ne 1991 ke veeraswami cese main ek faisle kaa hawala dete hue kaha ki kai baar bheetar ke andhere par roshni nahin padane di jaati he or darpok media bhi kinaaraa kar letaa he
 In this case, the Supreme Court had ruled that the police officer would have to get permission from the Chief Justice before investigation against the Chief Justice or any judge 
 jabaki iskaa praavdhaan vidhayika ke banaae kisi kanoon main nahin he
 Harpreet has referred to the suicide note of Arunachal Pradesh Chief Minister Kalikho Pul, in which a chief minister has accused lawyers, politicians and judges of demanding bribes before committing suicide
 kyon is maamle par bahadur channel chup ho gaye
 a Chief Minister commits suicide, gets a suicide note and is not worth discussing
 indian express main gautam bhaatia kaa lekh bhi aapako padhanaa
 needed
 gautam ne bataaya he ki america ke supreme court main sabhi 9 jaj cese kii sunwaayee ke liye saath baithte hai
 There are 12 judges in England
 aksar 5 yaa isse adhik jajon kaa panel to hota hi he
 There are 26 judges in the Supreme Court of India, here only a bench of 2 judges is heard
 ham patrakaron or aam logon ke liye bhi yah samajhnaa hoga ki jis taadaad main bharat main cese hai, kya yah sambhav he ki sabhi 9 jaj cese kii sunwaayee ke liye saath baithen
 If we understand the administrative process within the court on the pretext of this debate, it will greatly help in our journey forward
 ab aate hai sibiai ke jaj loya ke maamle main sunwaayee ko lekar
 There has been fierce controversy in this case also
 ravivaar ko jaj bi ech loya ke bete anuj loya or unke vakil ne press conference kiya
 Anuj said that he had no doubt in his father's death
 na jaanch chahie na raajnneeti honi chahie
 a controversy arose that Anuj had spoken to Amit Shah in his video for this press conference
 kai jagah whatsap uniwarsity main chal rahaa he
 This is completely untrue
 anuj loya ke saath baithe ek shaks ne kaha ki amit sar se milakar hamane apni baat kahi
 He called Amit Naik, a lawyer sitting near him, not Amit Shah
 jhuthe tathyon se saavdhaan rahiye chaahe wo kisi bhi paksh ke hon
 On November 20, the case of Judge Loya was first published in Caravan magazine, when a video statement of Judge Loya's doctor sister was also released
 aap khud yaad kiijie ki kis channel ne us bayaan ko dikhaaya tha
 Kiss who followed that story and who killed silence
 kya tab ve dar gaye the jo ab bahadur ban rahe hai
 He is doing well, showing Anuj Loya's statement prominently, but is he also talking about references, documents printed with this story, he will not, because many are now getting scared in the media
 20 nanvabar se lakar 14 janvari ke bich kairavaan patrika ne jaj loya kii maut se sambandhit das lekh chaape
 Those reports were not just statements of family members but also many questions and documents
 un sab par zyaadaatar channel chup hi rahe
 The question of Anuj's doctor aunt did not run on any channel, but Anuj's statement is going on
 ab iske zarie story ko khaarij kiya ja rahaa he
 Caravan magazine editor Haratosh Singh Bal is still keeping his story and demanding an inquiry
 tippaniyan Caravan had told in his story and showed evidence that in 2015, Anuj Loya had demanded an inquiry into his father's death and had threatened his life
 ab kyon kah rahe hai ki koi shaq nahin, vahi behatar bataa sakate hai
 After the Caravan story came out on 29 November, The Times of India reported that Anuj Loya met the Chief Justice of Bombay High Court and said that the family had no complaints
 tab us din tamaam news channelon ne is khabar ke prati yaa anuj loya ke bayaan ke prati utsaah kyon nahin dikhaaya
 Why were you silent, was the election going on somewhere? bharat kaa loktantr khatre main ho yaa na ho, media zarur khatare main he
 At whose behest, who is speaking, when is being silenced, now know more than news

 On Friday, the Supreme Court called Judge Loya's case serious
 16 janvari ko maharashtra sarkaar ko is maamle main jawaab dena he
 On 8 January, the Bombay Lawyers Association petitioned the High Court to investigate the matter

 The comments kairavaan ne apni story main bataaya tha or saboot dikhaaya tha ki 2015 main anuj loya ne apane pita kii maut kii jaanch kii maang kii thi or jaan ko khatara bataaya tha
 Now why are they saying that no doubt, they can tell better

 Then why on that day all the news channels did not show enthusiasm towards this news or about Anuj Loya's statement
 kyon chup rahe gaye, kya kahin chunaav chal rahaa tha isliye
 Whether India's democracy is in danger or not, the media is definitely at risk
 kiske ishaare par kab koun bol rahaa he, kab chup ho ja rahaa he, ab khabar se zyada iskaa pataa rakhie
 The Congress party has demanded an inquiry into the death of Judge Loya
 shuukravaar ko supreme court ne jaj loya ke maamle ko gambhir bataaya tha
 On 16 January, the Maharashtra government has to answer in this case
 8 janvari ko bombai loyr sangh ne hoicourt main yachika lagaai he ki maamle kii jaanch kii jaae
 So what was resolved in the Supreme Court

 The Uttar Pradesh assembly election is next year and once again the rama of Ram temple has started
 isi kadi main bijepi saansad yogi adityanath se 'aaj tak' ne khaas baatcheet kii
 Here are excerpts from their conversation
 1
 Question- Yogi ji, when no one could stop breaking the structure, then who will be able to stop Ram from building the temple? So when will you build a temple? Is all this statement going on in view of the election? Yogi: Every issue should not be left out of the election
 aakhir yah prashn ayodhya main ram janmabhumi par hi kyon uthaae ja rahe hai
 i think there should be no dispute on this day because on 30 September 2010 when both the parties agreed that we will abide by the verdict given by the court
 ham hinduon kii to ek hi maang thi jahaan ram lalaa virajman he, vahi ram janmabhumi he
 Where to dispute then
 nyaayalay ne to is baat ko kah diya he, yah sabit ho chukaa he ki muslim paksh ne court main jaakar jabardastee is maamle ko latakaane kaa prayaas kiya he
 For peace and harmony in the country, it is necessary for the development of the country that the issue should now be abolished and this path should be paved forward in line with public sentiments
 2
 Question- This issue has been going on for many years, when will Ram temple be built? Yogi - Let the time come which will be in front of you
 3
 Question- Is your government the majority you have? Yogi - This work is not for the government, it is the work of the society, the society will do its work according to its own
 samay aane dijie vakt ko dekh lijie
 4
 sawaal- aap ne kaha tha todane main koi nahin roak paaya to mandir banane main bhi koi nahin roak paaegaa?yogi- todane main jab koi baadha nahin he to nirmaan to ek rachanaatmak abhiyaan he to usamen to sabakaa sahyog hona chahie
 After all, the temple of Somnath was built
 usee tarj par ram mandir kaa nirmaan hoga
 5
 sawaal- yogi ji aajkal upi kii raajnneeti bhi garm he
 The manner in which the Qaumi Ekta Party was inducted into the Samajwadi Party caused controversy in the family
 shivpal yadav ne jwine karavaaya, akhilesh yadav ne mantri ko nikaal diya
 How do you see the whole sequence of events? Yogi: See the Bharatiya Janata Party government will be formed in Uttar Pradesh in 2017, and before the formation of the government, the situation of the stampede is visible in Bahujan Samajwadi Party and Samajwadi Party
 samaajawaadee party raajnneeti ke jis ghatiya str par utar sakati he us par vah kaary kar rahi he
 The Samajwadi Party is already infamous for this
 inhone raajnneeti kaa apradheekaran kiya he
 Professional criminals embrace the mafia and gangster is not a new game
 usee kaa hissaa he mukhtaar ansaari or atik ahamed jaise log pehle is party ke saath rahe hai
 Has come again today
 samaajawaadee party kii vaastaviktaa sabake saamne hai
 Due to this, the chaos and development of the state has been disrupted
 vahi sthiti bahujan samaajawaadee party main he
 No outsider is saying
 bahujan samaajawaadee party ke pradesh adhyaksh swami prasad maury is baat ko kehete hai kii mayawati ji dalit kii nahin balki daulat kii beti hai
 Here are the ticket rate fixes
 yah loktantr kaa uphaas he
 So much ridicule of Baba Saheb Bhimrao Ambedkar's values and ideals
 mujhe lagata he itnaa kabhi nahin hua hoga jitna bahujan samaajawaadee party ke dwaara tikat bechakar kiya ja rahaa he
 So there is a stampede before the election
 sabit karata kii chunaav aate-aate donon dalon kii kya sthiti hogi
 6
 sawaal- kya swami prasad maury ko bijepi main lene kaa soch rahi he party?yogi- kendriya netritv or pradesh netritv milakar tay kar legaa jo party hit main or pradesh ke hit main hoga
 i think the party will take necessary steps
 7
 Question- BJP will benefit by taking them? Yogi - See how much profit and how much loss comes from, the party is able to decide and the party will definitely consider it

 He said that sporadic incidents of ceasefire violations have been taking place for the last few days, whereas in the past a large number of such violations were taking place
 jetali ne enditivi se kaha, '

 People, who were happy with the decision of demonetisation, were upset over waiting for the withdrawal of money outside the bank and ATM for the last two months, they were also sad about the bumps found in the lines of banks
 lekin nae saal main jab selary acount main ai to bainkon main bhi happy avars laut aae hai
 The lines in the branch of banks are now returning to normal size and the complaints at the ATM line are also rarely heard

 There are several bank branches and atms in one line here
 selary aane ke baad somvaar ko pehla varking de tha, lekin bainkon main halaat saamaanya hi nazar aae
 Although the government has increased the cash withdrawal limit from ATM to 4500 from 2500, the weekly withdrawal limit is still 24 thousand
 is baavjood bainkon main aane vaale log pareshaan nahin dikhe
 The reason for this is that now they are getting 24 thousand rupees easily from the banks through checks
 kenra bank se paise nikaalkar nikal rahe ramshankar singh ne bataaya ki pichley maheene 24 hazaar ke check par rakam katkar paanch hazaar likhnaa padi thi, kyonki bank paanch hazaar se zyada dene ko taiyaar nahin tha
 So this time he had reached the bank with a blank check, but this time he managed to get the entire 24 thousand out of the bank
 roshan bhi bees hazarcashanikaalane ke baad santusht the, unka kahana tha ki kam se kam zarurat bhar kaa paisa ab aasaani se mil rahaa he
 If needed further, they can withdraw cash again next week

 10 minute main atm kii line main number aa rahaa he or paisa bhi zyada nikal rahaa he
 Overall, in the new year, bankers are faced with happy faces and satisfied customers, rather than surprised customers in banks
 ummid he ki sarkaar aane vaale vakt main raahaton kaa silsilaa jari rakhegi, taaki bainkon main happy avars barkaraar rahen

 Sammy, who was part of the RCB team of the previous IPL, said, "virat likes to be a part of every moment of the game while Dhoni's way of working is to do his work quietly without over-speaking
 'saimi ko aaarasibi ke saath bitaye saat hafton ke dauraan kohli kaa junun pasand aayaa jo is bhartiya ko anya khilaadiyon se alag karata he
 He said, 'everyone knows that Virat is a great batsman and he has the ability to lead with example

 Sammy, who retired from Test cricket last year, said he had no qualms about retiring at the age of 30 from the long format of the game
 unhone kaha, 'mujhe koi malaal nahin he
 i am very happy with my decision
 vaise bhi kaaphi log sochate hai ki maine jo 37 test khele ve kaaphi adhik hai

 vivaadon main ghire fifa ke ek naitik panchat ne somvaar ko cep blator or maaikel platini par yah kahkar aath saal kaa pratibandh laga diya ki unhone platini ko 20 lakh swiss franks ke bhugtan ke maamle main apane padon kaa durupyog kiya tha
 This decision against two of the most powerful people in world football, the gorakhandha running in this most popular sport of the world, again came into the headlines
 blator or platini ko har tarah kii footbal gatividhi se turant prabhaav se pratibandhit kar diya gaya
 79-year-old Blatter's career was almost over, while Platini's hopes of becoming the next FIFA president were almost wiped out
 fifa kii 1998 se kaman sambhaal rahe blator par 50,000 swiss franks or yuapha ke nilambit pramukh tathaa fifa upaadhyaksh platini par 80,000 franks kaa jurmaana lagaaya gaya
 The statement issued by the court stated that both abused their rights
 fifa 2011 main platini ko blator dwaara adhikrut 20 lakh swiss franks ke bhugtan kii jaanch kar rahaa tha
 He said that he was given as a consultant in lieu of his work from 1999 to 2002
 fifa kii adaalat ne donon ke khilaaf bhrashtachar ke aarope khaarij kar diya, lekin unhen hiton ke takaraav kaa doshi paaya
 It said, neither in written statement nor during the hearing could Blatter give any statutory basis for this payment
 tippaniyan Platini was also convicted of a conflict of interest
 adaalat ne kaha, platini puri vishwasaneeyata or naitikta ke saath kaam karne main naakaam rahe
 He was careless about his duty
 vah fifa ke niamak dhaanche or kanoon kaa sammaan karne main vifal rahe
 Blatter and Platini were temporarily suspended in October, when Swiss prosecutors launched a criminal investigation into the transfer of funds in 2011
 blator ke khilaaf aapraadhik jaanch chal rahi he, jabaki platini sandigdh or gavaah ke bich main hai
 Both have denied doing anything wrong
 blator ne pichley guuruuvaar fifa mukhyalay main aath ghante sunwaayee main bhaag liya, jabaki platini ne iskaa bahishkaar kiya tha
 Blatter was contesting the FIFA president for the fourth time at the time of the payment, made four years earlier and was later backed by Platini, but then turned against him
 blator or platini fifa ke apili panchat, khel panchat yaa swiss civil court main kisi bhi pratibandh ko chunauti de sakate hai
 Blatter will fight for his honor, while the ban on Platini's hopes of becoming FIFA president has been derailed
 vishwa footbal ke do sabase shaktishaalee vyaktiyon ke khilaaf is faisle se duniya ke is sabase lokapriy khel main chal rahaa gorakhdhandha phir sukhiryon main aa gaya
 Blatter and Platini were banned from all types of football activity with immediate effect
 79 baras ke blator kaa kariyar isse lagbhag khatm ho gaya, jabaki aglaa fifa adhyaksh banane kii platini kii ummiido par bhi lagbhag pani phir gaya
 Blatter, who has been in charge of FIFA since 1998, was fined 50,000 Swiss Franks and Uefa's suspended head and FIFA Vice President Platini 80,000 Franks
 adaalat dwaara jari bayaan main kaha gaya ki donon ne apane adhikaron kaa durupyog kiya
 FIFA was investigating the payment of 20 million Swiss francs authorized by Blatter to Platini in 2011
 unhone kaha ki yah bataur salaahkaar 1999 se 2002 tak unke kaam kii evaj main die gaye the
 The FIFA court dismissed corruption charges against the two, but found them guilty of conflict of interest
 isane kaha, naa to likhit bayaan main or naa hi sunwaayee ke dauraan blator is bhugtan kaa koi vaidhanik aadhaar bataa sake
 The comments platini ko bhi hiton ke takaraav kaa doshi paaya gaya
 The court said, Platini failed to act with full credibility and morality
 vah apane ferj ke prati laaparvaah rahe
 He failed to respect fifa's regulatory framework and legislation
 blator or platini ko oktober main asthaayee taur par nilambit kar diya gaya tha, jab swiss abhiyojkon ne 2011 main dhan ke hastantaran kii aapraadhik jaanch shuru kii thi
 a criminal investigation is going on against Blatter, while Platini is between the suspect and the witness
