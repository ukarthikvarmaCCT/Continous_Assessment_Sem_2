 You cannot put all the responsibility on the judiciary

 That too when the current number of judges in the High Courts is 50 percent less than the fixed number
 prati das lakh logon par desh main 10 jaj hai jabaki ye kam se kam 50 honi chahie
 To illustrate his point, the Chief Justice also gave an example of a question of Maths in 5th class, how many days a work will be done by 10 men together and 50 men will do the same work in how many days
 aabaadi badi par jajon kaa anupaat nahin sudharajustise thakur ne kaha ki bharat main america, austrailia, britain or canada ke mukaable logon or jajon kaa anupaat bahut kam he
 According to the Law Commission report in 1987, 40 thousand judges were needed
 1987 se lekar aaj tak aabaadi main 25 karod log jud gaye hai
 Referring to the figures, the CJI cited the factual figures, Jastis Thakurne said that when the Supreme Court came into existence in 1950, the court had 8 judges including CJI and 1215 cases were pending
 us samay prati jaj sau maamle lambit the
 In 1960 the number of judges increased to 14 and pending cases increased to 3247
 1977 main jajon kii sankhya 18 or maamalon kii sankhya 14501 ho gai
 By the year 2009, the number of judges in the Supreme Court was 31 and the pending cases were 77181
 unhone kaha ki saal 2014 main maamalon kii sankhya 81582 thi jise 60260 kiya gaya
 Justice Thakur said that on December 2, 2015, when i assumed the post of CJI, since then 17482 cases were filed in the Supreme Court out of which 16474 cases were dealt with, but judges also have a capacity to not be overburdened

 We talk of Make in India and FDI but we should not forget that those we are inviting are also concerned about the country's judicial system's ability to deal with cases and disputes arising out of such investments
 hamen yah nahin bhoolanaa chahie ki desh kaa vikaas nyaaypalika kii kshamta se judaa he
 Prime Minister Modi assured of help According to the program released by the Law Ministry, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was not supposed to speak in the program but after this passionate appeal of the Chief Justice, Prime Minister Modi also addressed the function
 piem modi ne kaha ki nyaaypalika main logon kii aasthaa he
 The Chief Justice has kept a very important point, i should not listen to him and i am not such a person
 agar koi sanvaidhanik simaaon kii dikkat naa ho to sijeai kii team or sarkaar ke pramukh log aapas main baith kar samaadhaan nikaalen
 The late Prime Minister said that it is the responsibility of all to decide that the common man has confidence in the judiciary and his government will fulfill the responsibility
 jajon kii bhartee main lagaataar ho rahi deree kesijeai ke bayaanpar pradhanmantri ne kaha jab jaago tab savera
 He said that i can understand his pain because a lot of time has passed since 1987

 dekhte hai ki beete hue kal ke boj ko kam karte hue kaise aage badha ja saktaa he
 PM said - The questions were raised by the judges on giving views while CM, remembering the incident of attending such a conference as the Chief Minister of Gujarat, he said that at that time he reduced the holidays in the courts, setting up courts in the morning and evening Had suggested that, but during the lunch break at the conference, some judges questioned his idea
 media ke saamne dobaaraa bhavuk hue sijeishuruaati seshan or sanyukt sammelan khatm tosijeai tii es thakur, kanoon mantri sadanand gauda, justise anil dave or justise je es khehar media se mukhaatib hue
 The CJI became emotional once again on the questions posed

 3 crore cases are pending

 jajon kii mushkil ko vahi samaj saktaa he jisane yaa to jaj kii naukari kii ho yaa jaj kii patni yaa baccha ho
 Even after 30 years of the Law Commission's recommendations, half the judge said that you just keep saying that finish the work
 kaise khatm karen? hamaare yahaan 81 cese ek din main lage hote hai
 There are 81 cases of 8 judges sitting abroad
 maine jindagi ke 45 saal guzaar die, isamen se 22 saal vakil ke taur par or 23 saal jaj ke taur par
 There is a kind of commitment, but it is an attempt to do something
 aaj se 30 saal pehle sarkaar ke apane lau kamishan ne bataaya ki desh main 40 hajaar jaj hone chahie
 What are 40 thousand judges even after 30 years? Even today, we have only 18–19 thousand judges
 to jahaan ek projects ko khatm karne ke liye 40 hajaar mazdooron kii jarrurat ho vahaan aapke paas 20 adad log kaam kar hon to jaahir he wo kaam mukammal nahin ho saktaa
 This work will not be done with any magic wand

 We are saying this again and again
 aapaki lau kamishan kah rahi he
 The Supreme Court has ordered that the number be increased
 pradhanmantri ne kaha badhayenge, lekin agar nahin bade to kya karen
 Emotion expresses our thinking Justice Thakur said on a question of 'aaj Tak' that i believe that there is a weakness in me, there should not be so much emotion
 ye jajbaat bhi kuch ishaara karte hai ki aadmi kya mahasoos karata he
 You have lived the whole life of a man in the hope that things will improve and when you finally come to end the innings, then you should feel happy
 kya aap bhi un logon main se hai jo asi vaale offis main kaam karke khud ko khushnaseeb samajhate hai? kya aap jab ghar main hote hai to us vakt bhi asi on hi rahata he or aap thik uske saamne baithna hi pasand karte hai? agar aap bhi aisa karne waalon main se hai to aapako bataa den ki aisa karnaa khatarnaak ho saktaa he or aapako apni is aadat ke bare main ekbar or sochane kii jarurat he

 ipel-6 main hui 'spot phixing' kaa bhanda phodkar dilli police ne us sabhi virodhiyon ke munh par taala laga diya he, jo kuch vakt pehle tak dilli police kamishnar kaa istipha maang rahe the
 In Aaj Tak's program 'sidhi Baat', Delhi Police Commissioner Neeraj Kumar said that he has put his hands on the three Rajasthan Royals' big players - s Sreesanth, Ajit Chandila and Ankit Chavan - carefully and knowing the legal betting
 jab niraj kumaar se poocha gaya ki jo poochtacha chal rahi he, kya usamen khilaadiyon ne apana gunaah kabool kiya he, to niraj kumaar ne kaha, 'hamaare paas itane saboot hai ki unke paas kabool karne ke alaava koi or rasta nahin he
 When he showed them the evidence, he could not deny it
 'jab niraj kumaar se poocha gaya ki kicretars ke vakil kah rahe hai ki police ke daawey khokhale hai or unke paas koi saboot nahin he, jisase ye sabit ho sake ki kicretars ne spot phixing kii
 To this Neeraj Kumar said, 'every lawyer says that his client is innocent
 par hamaare paas saboot he
 The hands of such big players have been deliberately kept knowing the legal betting
 ham sabooton ko court ke saamne pesh karenge or court nirnay legaa ki ye saboot uchit he yaa nahin
 'when the Police Commissioner was asked how do you know that the calls which came from outside came from the underworld
 ye dubai ke kisi ke bhi number se aa sakati hai
 How are you sure that these are the people of the underworld
 is sawaal par niraj kumaar ne kaha, 'hamaare paas aise kai kaaran hai jisase ham kah sakate he ki wo anderworld ke log hai
 But i cannot give this reason because it is not necessary to tell you all the details of the investigation
 'jab niraj kumaar se poocha gaya ki kuch vakeelon ne kaha ki police ne jo video clips dikhaai or jo tronscript sunai wo nahin karnaa chahie tha
 This is a media trial
 sidhaa court main jaakar apni baat rakhni chahie thi
 To this Neeraj Kumar said, 'this is done because no one believes our words
 doosraa makasad tha logon ko bataanaa ki jab bhi wo match dekhne jate he ye sochakar jate he ki vahaan sab kuch nishpaksh hota he par aisa hakeekat main nahin he
 What they consider to be fair is not fair
 'jab niraj kumaar se poocha gaya ki bisisiai or ipel kii anti karpshan unit he to kya aapako lagata he ki wo apana kaam thik se nahin kar pai, kyonki sari phixing unke naak ke neeche ho rahi thi, par unhen jaraa bhi bhanak nahin lagi
 So Neeraj Kumar said, 'I would not like to say anything on this
 main kisi or unit yaa sanstha par koi laanchhan nahin lagaana chahta
 'an important question was asked that as the business of match fixing has been going on for so many years, which we have failed to eliminate, then should betting be legalized
 is par niraj kumaar ne kaha, 'main police officer hum
 My job is to investigate and lead my force
 main is tarah kii baton par tippanee karnaa thik nahin samajhataa or is par faisla sarkaar ko karnaa hoga ki wo betting ko vaid karnaa chaahati he yaa nahin
 But i am strongly against legalizing it
 isse kai dushprabhav he
 By the way, Neeraj Kumar also spoke on the rising crime figures in Delhi and said, "stopping the crime figures is the easiest thing for the police, because when you come to file a complaint and you scare it and file a complaint Otherwise, the figures will be less
 pehle aisa hi hota tha jab shikaayatein darj nahin hoti thim, lekin mujhe garv he ki aaj logon kii ye shikaayat shunya ho gai hai ki main thane gaya or meraa cese darj nahin hua
 i do not care for these figures which show crime figures above on filing a complaint like this
 police kaa moolbhoot rifarm he ki police kii parformens kaa maapdand ye aankade nahin hone chahie, kyonki aakadon se khilwaad karnaa bahut aasaan he
 The performance criteria of the police should be how many cases have been solved and how many people have been caught

 Although everyone believed that it can change the way of reading and writing but cannot replace books
 hansraj college ke chaatr prashanth choudhary ne kaha ki kitaaben koi monolithik culture nahin he, jab ham samajhane kii koshish karte to dekhte hai ki internet kahin na kahin kitabon ko pramot hi karata he, ham internet ke jariye kitabon ke bare main jaanate hai or kharidte hai

 For the debt-ridden Jaypee Group, Formula One's return to the Buddha International Circuit (BIC) is not on the priority list but at the same time the head of the track Sameer Gaur said he did not plan to sell the $ 400 million track

 The reason for this is known by everyone, but it is not our idea to sell the circuit

 'BIC was dropped from the Formula-1 calendar after the race was held in three seasons from 2011 to 2013 and since then no major international races have been held here

 ' un maasoom ankhon main kal tak sunahare bhavishya kaa sapana tha
 His parents also saw the same dream and sent pieces of liver to the government hostels for studies
 lekin vakt kaa khel dekhie, padhai to dur wo bacchiyaan in dinon thik se so bhi nahin paatin
 Whom to complain to, because in the circle of questions, the hostel is the superintendent himself, who is probably helpless in front of the drunken husband
 shikaayat prashasan se bhi kii gai, lekin sab maun
 And in the midst of all this, innocent girls are forced to dance in the middle of the night with tears in their eyes
 bacchon ke maasoom kadam jab barabas thirakate hai to unamem bhavishya ke raah par chalane kii chahat hoti he, lekin madhya pradesh ke ek adivasee girls hostel kaa samaa unki chaahaton ko kulchane vaala or dard main simati sisakiyaan lekar aata he
 It is alleged that the husband of the superintendent of this hostel situated in Gangatola in Seoni district gets the girls to dance in the dark of night
 vah bhi tab jab vah buree tarah nashe main hota he
 There is a lot of allegations that girls do not get any kind of food in the hostel nor are they given treatment when they are ill
 hostel kii ek bacchee rani kahati he, 'madam ji ke pati aate hai daaru pikar or hamako naachne ko bolte hai
 Food also does not get good
 ' aisa nahin he ki bacchiyon ke mata-pita jab is bare main nahin jaanate or is ore prashasan kaa darwaja nahin khatkhataya gaya
 It is said that the application was given in the case to the Collector of the district, but apart from the assurance, nothing else was involved
 ek bacchee ke pita rupalal kehete hai, 'bacchee ne hamen bataaya to ham 10 logon ne colector sahab ko aavedan die
 The Collector was applied twice
 unhone kaha ki jaanch karaayenge, report aegi jab bataaenge
 Even reached the district with a complaint, but there was no hearing
 'mere pati ke paas phaltu time nahin hedusri ore, hostel suparitendent gita kumre ne puure ghatnakram se anjaan banate hue kaha, 'is cheez kii jaankaree ek to aap logon ne mujhe bataai or iske pehle sar log aae the to unhone mujhe bataaya
 But if there was such a thing, then there is a peon here, he would first tell me
 hamaare hostel main itnaa vidroh he ki agar kisi bacchee kii tabiyat kharaab ho jaati he to puure paalak shikshak sangh main hallaa ho jaataa he
 The meeting takes place ten times

 mere pati police vibhaag main hai jabalpur main, jab kabhi unki shaskeey chuttee hoti he tab wo mere paas yahaan aate hai or aaenge ek din ke liye to bacchon se milenge, mujh se milenge
 They do not have enough time to start dancing or abusing a girl in the closed campus, because they are monitored from all sides
 'bacchon ne teacher se kii thi shikayatahostel suparitendent bhale hi aisi kisi ghatana se inkaar kare, lekin ek duusari teacher kaa kahana he ki bacchon ne unase nachvaane vaali baat kii shikaayat kii thi
 Teacher Sujata Kumre says, "the children told me that the husband of the superintendent gets drunk
 maine unako kaha ki betaa jab koi adhikari aaenge to unako bolnaa
 Officers come and go
 bachche ro-rokar bataate hai, lekin bacchon kii samasya kaa niraakaran ab tak nahin hua he
 The complaint of the girls is that they do not get good food in hostels
 ek bacchee bataati he ki hostli main patali daal or sabji milti he
 Sometimes they get so little food that their stomach is not filled
 yahi nahin, ravivaar ko bacchiyaan bhukh kii shikaayat karti hai to adhikshika kahati hai ki teacher ko bolo ravivaar ko bhi skool lagaaein
 However, it is also interesting that this story of atrocities on girls belongs to the state where good governance is prevalent and Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan describes himself as the maternal uncle of girls

 ) agle kuch saalon main punjab ke chaatr chini bhashaa main baat karte sune ja sakenge
 The Punjab government is soon going to start courses in foreign languages, especially Chinese language, in local schools, and the Punjab Chief Minister announced this in the assembly that students up to class 12 will study Chinese as an alternative language
 punjabake sarkari skulon main hindi ,punjabi or angreji ke saath-sathchini bhashaabhi bacchon ko padhai jaaegi
 Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh said that along with Chinese, students will also get the option of other foreign languages
 ye videshi bhashaaen punjab ke 11veen or 12veen ke chaatr pard sakenge or ye vikalp ke aadhaar par hongi
 Chief Minister Captain Singh said that China shares borders with many countries
 is vajah se in kshetron main chini bhashaa behad lokapriy hoti ja rahi he, saath hi desh ke kai rajyon main china ke log rahete hai
 In such a situation, China language will be given priority over other languages
 duusari ore, punjab keop partike netaa aman aroda ne aarope lagaate hue kaha ki sarkaar ke paas skulon ke liye paryaapt infrastracchar nahin he
 The government is closing many schools and there are teachers to teach courses in other languages, but there is talk of implementing foreign languages in schools
 ye ek hasyaspad pahal he
 The AAP leader accused the government that first the Punjab government should provide better education to the girl students and teachers along with the education policy and then implement foreign languages
 vahiin, akali dal kii ore se bikram singh majithia ne bhi sarkaar ke is elaan par etraj jataate hue kaha ki ek ore to punjab sarkaar kah rahi he ki unke paas teacheron ko selary dene ke liye paise nahin he or skulon main bhi infrastracchar kii baari kami he
 In such a situation, where will the tutors who teach Chinese language be managed and from where the money will be given to them
 ye apane aap main sarkaar kii dohari ranneeti ko dikhaata he
 In Punjab, the condition of children studying in government schools already in English and mother tongue Punjabi is very bad, in such a situation, what is the government's strategy to teach Chinese language and what will be the benefit of Punjab students
 ye to aane vaala vakt hi batayega
 People have not seen Aamir Khan in any award function till date
 naa to wo kabhi aword lete hai or naa hi kisi function main parform hi karte hai
 But have you ever wondered why Salman Khan never takes the award
 salmaan ko aword shoj main parform karte to bahut baar dekha gaya he lekin aword lete nahin
 Salman is currently in New York for the IIFA Awards
 IIFA: salmaan bole- mujhe sirf ek hi date yaad, wo he katrina kaa b'dayvaham unhone bataaya ki wo stage par sirf parform karne jate hai
 He is not quite sure at the awards
 salmaan ne kaha- mujhe kabhi koi aword nahin mila
 i think i won the Supporting Actor Award just once, which i never took home
 mujhe awords nahin puraskaar pasand he
 Long ago a magazine editor requested me to appear on an award show
 mujhe film maine pyaar kiya ke liye nominete kiya gaya tha
 He said that if i come, i will be given the award
 bachchan family ne aakhir kyon IIFA ko kiya Boycott, kya salmaan he vajah?unhone aage bataaya ki jab unhone nomination anouns kiya to jaiki shroff, salmaan khan or kisi or kaa naam liya gaya
 Woke up when i heard my name
 usee samay anouns kiya gaya ki vinar jaiki shroff hai
 That day i swore i would never come back
 main kabhi aword nahin letaa
 Just perform agar mere kharaab parformens ke liye mujhe itane paise milte hai, to main bahut khush hum
 Salman will perform at IIFA on July 15
 vahiin adwantage se jude sutron ne enditivi ko bataaya ki sikoiya ne vaasan ke sheyaron kaa moolyankan kisi 'khaas vajah' se hi nahin kiya hoga
 He also said that these 'controversial vassals' have been created by people who have been 'close friends of Karti Chidambaram for decades' and there is no scope for any 'speculation, debate or discussion' on the things written in those wills
 maharashtra kii devendra fadanvis sarkaar ne marathaon ko 16 fisadi aarakshan dene ke elaan par amal karte hue vidhansabha or vidhaan parishad se bill paas kara liya
 After this, other people of the society have also started demanding reservation
 AIMIM pramukh asaduddin ovaisi ne maharashtra main muslimarakshanka mudda uthaaya he
 He said that he would go to court for reservation of Muslims in the field of education and jobs
 owesi kii maang kaa bijepi kii sahyogi party shivasena ne samarthan kiya he
 Explain that the Shiv Sena is a BJP ally in the Center and Maharashtra
 shivasena ke vidhayak sunil prabhu ne kaha ki party samaaj ke dabe kuchle logon ko nyaay dilaane ke liye aawaaj uthaaegi
 He said that i had also questioned in the House what steps have been taken for reservation of Muslims
 unhone kaha ki shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare ne saaf kar diya tha jitne bhi dabe kuchle log hai unako aarakshan diya jayega, chaahe wo kisi bhi pichde samaaj ke hon, chaahe wo muslim hi kyon na hon
 He said that we are fighting the fight against injustice and will continue to fight further
 5 fisadi aarakshan ke liye court jaaegi eimmemm vidhayak imtiyaaj jaleel ne kaha ki muslimon ke liye 5 fisadi aarakshan ke liye emm court kaa darwaja khatkhatane kii taiyaari main he
 congress-ncp Muslim mlas have nothing to do with the Muslim community
 unhone kaha ki jis aadhaar par maratha samudaay kaa aarakshan diya gaya aisa bada garib tabaka muslim samaaj me bhi he
 Therefore, they will challenge the government in the court to talk of denying reservation on the basis of religion
 muslim varg kaa pichhadaapan siddh karanevaala data court main pesh karenge
 What Owaisi said: AIMIM President Asaduddin Owaisi has demanded reservation for Muslims in Maharashtra saying that Muslims too are entitled to reservation as they have been in poverty for generations
 ovaisi ne twitor par likhaa ki rojgaar or shiksha main pichde musalamaanon ko vanchit rakhana anyaay he
 i have consistently said that there are such backward castes in the Muslim community who have been in poverty for generations
 aarakshan ke jariye inhen baahar nikaala ja saktaa he
 Depriving backward Muslims of their fair share in public employment & education is a grave injustice
 I've consistently argued that there are backward castes in Muslims who have lived for generations in a cycle of poverty
 Reservation is a tool that will break this cyclepic
 twitter
 com / oc8ls5rdxa — Asaduddin Owaisi (@asadowaisi) November 29, 2018 The Maratha reservation in Maharashtra was approved by the Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis on Thursday after the Cabinet approval for the Maratha reservation in Maharashtra
 fadanvis ne bada daanv khelte hue pichhadaa ayog kii sifarish ke aadhaar par 16 pratishat maratha aarakshan kaa bill pesh kiya, jo dhvanimat se paas ho gaya
 Later, the Legislative Council also approved the bill
 maratha aarakshan ke liye vishesh category SEBC banaai gai he
 76 per cent of Marathi farmers in Maharashtra are living on farming and wages
 vahiin sirf 6 fisadi log sarkari-arddh sarkari naukari main hai
 The Economic Times reports that the Income Tax authorities are confused about how to impose a 200 percent penalty on disproportionate assets
 vitt mantralay ke adhikari ne notebandi ke turant baad iskaa elaan kiya tha
 Income tax officials have said that there is no such provision in the law, under which banks can be fined 200 per cent for cash deposits
 agar koi ek karod kii raashi bank main jamaa karata he, 33 fisadi tex detaa he, or apana paisa 2017-18 ke iskar ritern main dikhaa detaa he to uskaa kya karenge
 Income tax officials have told the newspaper that for this, the income tax law will have to be changed from the back date
 agar aap 200 fisadi jurmaana lagaayenge to sara paisa rajya ke khazaane main chalaa jayega
 The newspaper 'ET' has also written that thousands of trucks have parked on the highway
 30 lakh trakon kaa 90 fisadi hissaa do dinon se thama hua he
 This can cause problems in the supply of essential commodities and may increase prices
 note-vaapasi ke saath-saath upabhoktaaon ko adhik daam dekar bhi is rashtriya parv main khushi-khushi yogadan dena hoga
 If the government is strict then cash work in the transport and logistics sector should be stopped
 kya vah aisa kar sakati he
 
 
 The The driver of the truck will not give a bribe with a credit card
 
 
 ? dhabas par khaanaa kaise khayega
 
 
 The If the cash cannot be completely closed, then some percentage must be fixed, so that the people in the line of sacrifice can be confident that the black-moneyed people are in trouble
 doosraa, transport sector ko cash par nirbhar rahanaa hota he, yah bhi hamen samajhnaa hoga
 There is no option of overloading
 iske naam par hone vaali kamai bhi koi nahin roak sakaa he
 When our political parties come into the government, this sector contributes greatly to the expenses of their elections and to mobilize the resources for the next election, so that the leaders of those parties can act by giving speeches against corruption
 aisa nahin he ki artio ke bare main sarkaar ko pataa nahin
 In August 2014, at a meeting in Pune, Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari said that the RTO system would be abolished soon by introducing a law
 kya artio system samaapt ho chukaa he
 
 
 The More than two years have passed
 sarkaar ne bataaya he ki notebandi ke teen din ke bheetar bainkon main teen lakh karod rupee jamaa hue hai or 50,000 karod nikaale gaye hai
 Now some questions are made here
 kya teen lakh karod puri tarah se kaala dhan he
 
 
 The If the government, banks or Reserve Bank can tell the total money deposited in banks so soon, then some other questions can be answered
 
 
 ? is teen lakh karod main se kitni raashi puraane noton ke jamaa karne kii he
 What amount is less than ten and five thousand
 auraton ke khate main kitne paise jamaa hue hai
 He and farmers are exempted from tax and inquiries on deposits of up to Rs 2
5 lakh
 kya reserve bank bataa saktaa he ki gramin sector main kitne paise jamaa hue or mumbai-dilli jaise bade shaharon main kitne paise jamaa hue
 Reports from Agra have appeared in a newspaper that several crores of rupees have been deposited in Jan Dhan accounts
 agar vah report sahi he to sarkaar ko yah bhi bataanaa chahie ki deshbhar main karodon jan-dhan khaaton main kitne paise jamaa hue
 What a jump in Zero Jan Dhan accounts
 sarkaar bataati bhi rahi he ki jan-dhan main kitna paisa jamaa hua he, to is baar kyon nahin bataa rahi he
 By exposing it now, it may happen that those who black money through these accounts can be curbed
 hamen bhi pataa chalegaa ki jan-dhan khaaton kaa istamaal to nahin ho rahaa he
 The figure of three lakh crores makes an image, but it is not the real picture
 teen lakh karod ke baad yah rakam 10 lakh karod tak bhi pahunch sakati he
 a lot of money may be from normal business activities
 kya use bhi teen lakh karod main shaamil kar liya gaya he
 Before demonetisation, how many lakh crore rupees were usually deposited in banks
 
 
 ? 'iconomic times' ne likhaa he ki 9 se 12 november ke bich subah-subah 1 lakh 67 hazaar karod kaa len-dein hua
 Of this, 45,000 crore old notes were deposited
 vah bhi sirf state bank of india main
 75,945 crore has been deposited in SBI since Wednesday
 bank of india main 15,000 karod or central bank of india main chaar hazaar karod
 According to the newspaper, private banks have not released their figures
 in raashiyon ko puraane note or kaale dhan ke rup main samajhnaa zaruri he
 If not all black money, then why is it being told or what is the hurry to tell it
 iskaa matlab yah bhi he ki ham rose kaa rose jaan sakate hai ki 9 november ke baad jo raashi jamaa hui he, usamen se kitne puraane noton ke jamaa hone kii he or kitne paise electronic se lekar tamaam kaarobaari transaction ke hai
 It is heard in many ways that black money is being adjusted in different books outside the banks
 kya sarkaar ke paas is tarah kii herapheri ko trek karne kaa koi zariyaa he
 
 
 The That is, can the government know electronically how the companies' books are going up
 agar yahi log batch gaye to phir kya phayda
 Looked at many business newspapers carefully
 sone kii kareed kitni badi, is par to lekh aane bhi band ho gaye hai
 There is no concrete information
 ekaadh dukaanon main chhapemari kii khabar he, jabaki is desh main lakhon dukaane hai
 Why are the government agencies not telling how much investment was made through gold or property in these four days
 do-chaar badi karravaaiyaan in sawaalon kaa jawaab ban jaaengi, magar ve jawaab nahin ho saktin
 Do two to three big actions as a symbol, get accolades and leave the rest of the questions and keep going
 2 may, 2016 ke 'indian express' main harish damodaran kii ek report chhapi thi
 He has stated that at the annual end of March 2016, deposits in banks were only 9
 9 pratishat hi badi he
 This single-digit case in the deposit was registered only in 1962-63
 yani bainkon main jamaa raashi ko dekhen to unki haalat karaab chal rahi thi
 Harish Damodaran has written, analyzing several reasons, that it is possible that people's income is not only increasing, so the deposits of banks are historically decreasing
 to kya yah sari kavayad biimaar bainkon ko bachaane kii he
 
 
 ? Comments 'bijness standard' akhbaar ne to baqayada chart nikaala he ki kitne ke kaale dhan par aapako kitna tex dena hoga, kitna jurmaana dena hoga
 The chart with different terms states how much tax will be levied and how much fine
 akhbaar ne bataaya he ki agar aapke paas paanch lakh rupee kii aghoshit raashi he, koi tex nahin dete rahe hai, to aapako us par 20,600 tex dena hoga
 Its 200 percent fine was 41,200
 yani aap paanch lakh kaa kaala dhan sirf 61,800 dekar safed kar sakate hai
 If this calculation is correct, then this scheme is nothing else, Happy Diwali for cash black money holders
 aapako paanch lakh kii aghoshit raashi par sirf 12 pratishat tex or panelti deni hogi
 If you have been paying tax on the income of five lakhs and you have an undisclosed amount of one crore, then you will have to pay a fine of Rs 87,29,250 including the penalty and penalty
 87 fisadi tex lag jayega
 Yet 13 lakh rupees will turn white
 chor ke paas 13 lakh bhi batch jaaen to samajhiye ki vah raja hi rahaa
 In today's era, information and facts are not important
 moti baat logon main chali gai he ki kaale dhan ke kilaaf aitihaasik karrwai hui he
 Five hundred and thousand notes have ceased
 kai tarah ke sawaalon ko andekha kiya ja rahaa he
 Why are only the poor and common people upset in the pictures of TV and newspapers
 jabaki yahi ve log hai, jo puure man se sarkaar kaa samarthan bhi kar rahe hai
 Black money has been erased, if it is claimed then where are all the facts
 agar udyog jagat or kaarobaar jagat ke paas kaala dhan tha, to unke bich saarvajanik haahaakaar kyon nahin he
 Why the government is not telling anything about them, so that people standing in the queue can be more patient that they are historically performing their national responsibility
 akhbaar 'iti' ne yah bhi likhaa he ki hazaron kii sankhya main trek haive par khadey ho gaye hai
 90% of 30 lakh trucks have been suspended for two days
 isse zaruri chizon kii aapurti main dikkat aa sakati he or daam bad sakate hai
 Along with the return of note, consumers will have to contribute happily to this national festival by paying a higher price
 agar sarkaar sakht he to transport or logistic sector main cash se hone vaale kaam ko band kar dena chahie
 Can she do that 
 
 ? trek kaa driver credit card se to rishwat nahin degaa na
 
 
 The How would you eat food at the dhaba
 
 
 ? agar puri tarah se cash band nahin ho saktaa, to kuch pratishat tay hona chahie, taaki balidaan kii qatari main lagi janata ko bharosa ho ki kaale dhan vaale sahi main pareshaan hai
 Second, we have to understand that the transport sector has to depend on cash
 overloding kaa koi vikalp nahin ban paaya he
 No one has been able to stop earning in its name
 hamaare raajnneetik dal jab sarkaar main aate hai, to yahi sector unke chunaav kaa karcha or agle chunaav kaa sansaadhan jutaney main bahut yogadan karata he, taaki un dalon ke netaa bhrashtachar ke kilaaf bhaashan dekar ladane kaa abhinay kar saken
 It is not that the government does not know about RTO
 agast, 2014 main pune kii ek sabha main parivahan mantri nitin gadakari ne kaha tha ki jaldi hi ek kanoon laakar artio system samaapt kar denge
 Is the RTO system finished? 
 
 ? do saal se zyaada samay biit chukaa he
 The government has told that within three days of demonetisation, Rs 3 lakh crore has been deposited in banks and 50,000 crore has been withdrawn
 ab yahaan kuch sawaal banate hai
 Is three lakh crores completely black money
 
 
 ? agar sarkaar, bank yaa reserve bank itani jaldi bainkon main jamaa total paisa bataa sakate hai, to kya kuch or sawaalon ke jawaab mil sakate hai
 
 
 The Out of this three lakh crores, how much amount has to be deposited with the old notes
 kitni raashi das or paanch hazaar se kam kii he
 How much money has been deposited in the account of women
 unhen or kisaanon ko dhai lakh tak kii raashi jamaa hone par tex or poochtacha se chhot mili he
 Can the Reserve Bank tell how much money was deposited in the rural sector and how much money was deposited in big cities like mumbai-delhi
 ek akhbaar main agra se report chhapi he ki jan-dhan khaaton main kai karod rupee jamaa hue hai
 If that report is correct then the government should also tell how much money was deposited in crores of Jan Dhan accounts across the country
 zero jan-dhan khaaton main kitna oochaal aayaa he
 The government has also been telling how much money has been accumulated in public money, so why is it not telling this time
 abhi ise ujagar karne se yah ho saktaa he ki in khaaton ke zariye kaala dhan safed karne waalon par ankush lag saktaa he
 We will also know that jan-dhan accounts are not being used
 teen lakh karod ke aankade se ek chhavi to banati he, magar vah asli tasviir nahin he
 After three lakh crores, this amount can reach 10 lakh crores
 ho saktaa he ki kaaphi paisa saamaanya kaarobaari gatividhiyon kaa ho
 Has he also been included in three lakh crores
 notebandi se pehle bainkon main aamtaur par kitne lakh karod rupee jamaa ho rahe the
 
 
 The The Economic Times has written that between 9 to 12 November, 1 lakh 67 thousand crore transactions took place in the morning
 isamen se 45,000 karod ke puraane note jamaa hue
 That too only at State Bank of India
 buudhvaar se esbiai main 75,945 karod jamaa hua he
 15,000 crores in Bank of India and four thousand crores in Central Bank of India
 akhbaar ke anusaar nijee bainkon ne apane aankade jari nahin kiye hai
 It is important to consider these zodiac signs as old notes and black money
 agar sabhi kaala dhan nahin he, to phir kyon bataaya ja rahaa he yaa ise bataane kii jaldi kya he
 It also means that we can know every day, how much of the old notes are deposited after 9 November, and how much money is from electronic to all business transactions
 kai tarah se sunne main aa rahaa he ki bainkon se baahar alag-alag bahikhaaton main kaale dhan ko edjust kiya ja rahaa he
 Does the government have any way of tracking such rigging? 
 
 ? yani kya sarkaar electronic tareeke se jaan sakati he ki companiyon ke bahikhaaton main kis tarah se oochaal aa rahaa he
 If these people survive then what is the use? kai bijness akhabaaron ko gaur se dekha
 Articles have stopped coming on how much the purchase of gold has increased
 thos jaankaree nahin he
 There is news of raiding in a few shops, while there are millions of shops in this country
 sarkaar kii agenciyaan yah kyon nahin bataa rahi hai ki in chaar dinon main sona yaa property ke zariye kitna nivesh hua
 Two to four big actions will become the answer to these questions, but they cannot be the answer
 pratik ke taur par do–teen badi karrwai kar dijie, vaahvahee batorie or baaki sawaalon ko chhodkar chalate banie
 a report by Harish Damodaran was published in the Indian Express of May 2, 2016
 unhone bataaya he ki march, 2016 kii vaarshik samaapti par bainkon main jamaa raashi sirf 9
 It has increased by only 9 percent
 dipoggit main single disit kii yah naubat 1962-63 main hi darj hui thi
 That is, his condition was deteriorating when he saw the deposits in banks

 ?tippaniyan The 'business Standard' newspaper has prepared a chart of how much tax you will have to pay on black money, how much penalty you have to pay
 alag-alag sharton ke saath chart main bataaya gaya he ki kitna tex lagegaa or kitna jurmaana
 The newspaper has said that if you have an undisclosed amount of five lakh rupees, do not pay any tax, then you will have to pay 20,600 tax on it
 iskaa 200 fisadi jurmaana hua 41,200
 That is, you can make white by giving only 61,800 of black money of five lakhs
 agar yah hisaab sahi he to phir to yah skim kuch or nahin, nagdi kaale dhan rakhane waalon ke liye happy diwaali he
 You have to pay only 12 percent tax and penalty on the undisclosed amount of five lakh
 agar aap paanch lakh kii aay par tex dete rahe hai or aapke paas ek karod kii aghoshit raashi nikalati he to us par jurmaana or panelti milakar 87,29,250 rupee dene honge
 87 percent tax will be levied
 phir bhi 13 lakh rupaya safed ho jayega
 If there is even 13 lakhs left with the thief, then understand that he remained the king
 aaj ke daur main soochnaaon or tathyon kii koi ahmiyat nahin he
 Fatty thing has gone to the people that historical action has been taken against black money
 paanch sau or hazaar ke note band ho gaye hai
 Many types of questions are being ignored
 tivi or akhabaaron kii tasveeron main sirf garib or aam log hi pareshaan kyon hai
 While these are the people who are wholeheartedly supporting the government
 kaala dhan mit gaya he, agar iskaa daawa he to saare tathy kahaan hai
 If industry and business had black money, then why is there no public outcry among them
 sarkaar unke bare main kyon nahin kuch bataa rahi he, taaki qatari main khadey logon main or sabar paidaa ho sake ki ve aitihaasik rup se apana rashtriya daayitv nibhaa rahe hai
 Second, the transport sector has to rely on cash, which is why we have to understand
 overloding kaa koi vikalp nahin ban paaya he
 No one has been able to stop earning in its name
 hamaare raajnneetik dal jab sarkaar main aate hai, to yahi sector unke chunaav kaa karcha or agle chunaav kaa sansaadhan jutaney main bahut yogadan karata he, taaki un dalon ke netaa bhrashtachar ke kilaaf bhaashan dekar ladane kaa abhinay kar saken
 It is not that the government does not know about RTO
 agast, 2014 main pune kii ek sabha main parivahan mantri nitin gadakari ne kaha tha ki jaldi hi ek kanoon laakar artio system samaapt kar denge
 Is the RTO system finished? 
 
 ? do saal se zyaada samay biit chukaa he
 The government has told that within three days of demonetisation, Rs 3 lakh crore has been deposited in banks and 50,000 crore has been withdrawn
 ab yahaan kuch sawaal banate hai
 Is three lakh crores completely black money
 
 
 ? agar sarkaar, bank yaa reserve bank itani jaldi bainkon main jamaa total paisa bataa sakate hai, to kya kuch or sawaalon ke jawaab mil sakate hai
 
 
 The Out of this three lakh crores, how much amount has to be deposited with the old notes
 kitni raashi das or paanch hazaar se kam kii he
 How much money has been deposited in the account of women
 unhen or kisaanon ko dhai lakh tak kii raashi jamaa hone par tex or poochtacha se chhot mili he
 Can the Reserve Bank tell how much money was deposited in the rural sector and how much money was deposited in big cities like mumbai-delhi
 ek akhbaar main agra se report chhapi he ki jan-dhan khaaton main kai karod rupee jamaa hue hai
 If that report is correct then the government should also tell how much money was deposited in crores of Jan Dhan accounts across the country
 zero jan-dhan khaaton main kitna oochaal aayaa he
 The government has also been telling how much money has been accumulated in public money, so why is it not telling this time
 abhi ise ujagar karne se yah ho saktaa he ki in khaaton ke zariye kaala dhan safed karne waalon par ankush lag saktaa he
 We will also know that jan-dhan accounts are not being used
 teen lakh karod ke aankade se ek chhavi to banati he, magar vah asli tasviir nahin he
 After three lakh crores, this amount can reach 10 lakh crores
 ho saktaa he ki kaaphi paisa saamaanya kaarobaari gatividhiyon kaa ho
 Has he also been included in three lakh crores
 notebandi se pehle bainkon main aamtaur par kitne lakh karod rupee jamaa ho rahe the
 
 
 The The Economic Times has written that between 9 to 12 November, 1 lakh 67 thousand crore transactions took place in the morning
 isamen se 45,000 karod ke puraane note jamaa hue
 That too only at State Bank of India
 buudhvaar se esbiai main 75,945 karod jamaa hua he
 15,000 crores in Bank of India and four thousand crores in Central Bank of India
 akhbaar ke anusaar nijee bainkon ne apane aankade jari nahin kiye hai
 It is important to consider these zodiac signs as old notes and black money
 agar sabhi kaala dhan nahin he, to phir kyon bataaya ja rahaa he yaa ise bataane kii jaldi kya he
 It also means that we can know every day, how much of the old notes are deposited after 9 November, and how much money is from electronic to all business transactions
 kai tarah se sunne main aa rahaa he ki bainkon se baahar alag-alag bahikhaaton main kaale dhan ko edjust kiya ja rahaa he
 Does the government have any way of tracking such rigging? 
 
 ? yani kya sarkaar electronic tareeke se jaan sakati he ki companiyon ke bahikhaaton main kis tarah se oochaal aa rahaa he
 If these people survive then what is the use? kai bijness akhabaaron ko gaur se dekha
 Articles have stopped coming on how much the purchase of gold has increased

 There is news of raiding in a few shops, while there are millions of shops in this country
 sarkaar kii agenciyaan yah kyon nahin bataa rahi hai ki in chaar dinon main sona yaa property ke zariye kitna nivesh hua
 Two to four big actions will become the answer to these questions, but they cannot be the answer

 a report by Harish Damodaran was published in the Indian Express of May 2, 2016

 Reports from Agra have appeared in a newspaper that several crores of rupees have been deposited in Jan Dhan accounts
 agar vah report sahi he to sarkaar ko yah bhi bataanaa chahie ki deshbhar main karodon jan-dhan khaaton main kitne paise jamaa hue
 What a jump in Zero Jan Dhan accounts
 sarkaar bataati bhi rahi he ki jan-dhan main kitna paisa jamaa hua he, to is baar kyon nahin bataa rahi he
 By exposing it now, it may happen that those who black money through these accounts can be curbed
 hamen bhi pataa chalegaa ki jan-dhan khaaton kaa istamaal to nahin ho rahaa he
 The figure of three lakh crores makes an image, but it is not the real picture
 teen lakh karod ke baad yah rakam 10 lakh karod tak bhi pahunch sakati he
 a lot of money may be from normal business activities
 kya use bhi teen lakh karod main shaamil kar liya gaya he
 Before demonetisation, how many lakh crore rupees were usually deposited in banks
 
 
 ? 'iconomic times' ne likhaa he ki 9 se 12 november ke bich subah-subah 1 lakh 67 hazaar karod kaa len-dein hua
 Of this, 45,000 crore old notes were deposited
 vah bhi sirf state bank of india main
 75,945 crore has been deposited in SBI since Wednesday
 bank of india main 15,000 karod or central bank of india main chaar hazaar karod
 According to the newspaper, private banks have not released their figures
 in raashiyon ko puraane note or kaale dhan ke rup main samajhnaa zaruri he
 If not all black money, then why is it being told or what is the hurry to tell it
 iskaa matlab yah bhi he ki ham rose kaa rose jaan sakate hai ki 9 november ke baad jo raashi jamaa hui he, usamen se kitne puraane noton ke jamaa hone kii he or kitne paise electronic se lekar tamaam kaarobaari transaction ke hai
 It is heard in many ways that black money is being adjusted in different books outside the banks
 kya sarkaar ke paas is tarah kii herapheri ko trek karne kaa koi zariyaa he
 
 
 The That is, can the government know electronically how the companies' books are going up
 agar yahi log batch gaye to phir kya phayda
 Looked at many business newspapers carefully
 sone kii kareed kitni badi, is par to lekh aane bhi band ho gaye hai
 There is no concrete information
 ekaadh dukaanon main chhapemari kii khabar he, jabaki is desh main lakhon dukaane hai
 Why are the government agencies not telling how much investment was made through gold or property in these four days
 do-chaar badi karravaaiyaan in sawaalon kaa jawaab ban jaaengi, magar ve jawaab nahin ho saktin
 Do two to three big actions as a symbol, get accolades and leave the rest of the questions and keep going
 2 may, 2016 ke 'indian express' main harish damodaran kii ek report chhapi thi
 He has stated that at the annual end of March 2016, deposits in banks were only 9
 9 pratishat hi badi he
 This single-digit case in the deposit was registered only in 1962-63
 yani bainkon main jamaa raashi ko dekhen to unki haalat karaab chal rahi thi
 Harish Damodaran has written, analyzing several reasons, that it is possible that people's income is not only increasing, so the deposits of banks are historically decreasing
 to kya yah sari kavayad biimaar bainkon ko bachaane kii he
 
 
 ? Comments 'bijness standard' akhbaar ne to baqayada chart nikaala he ki kitne ke kaale dhan par aapako kitna tex dena hoga, kitna jurmaana dena hoga
 The chart with different terms states how much tax will be levied and how much fine
 akhbaar ne bataaya he ki agar aapke paas paanch lakh rupee kii aghoshit raashi he, koi tex nahin dete rahe hai, to aapako us par 20,600 tex dena hoga
 Its 200 percent fine was 41,200
 yani aap paanch lakh kaa kaala dhan sirf 61,800 dekar safed kar sakate hai
 If this calculation is correct, then this scheme is nothing else, Happy Diwali for cash black money holders
 aapako paanch lakh kii aghoshit raashi par sirf 12 pratishat tex or panelti deni hogi
 If you have been paying tax on the income of five lakhs and you have an undisclosed amount of one crore, then you will have to pay a fine of Rs 87,29,250 including the penalty and penalty
 87 fisadi tex lag jayega
 Yet 13 lakh rupees will turn white
 chor ke paas 13 lakh bhi batch jaaen to samajhiye ki vah raja hi rahaa
 In today's era, information and facts are not important
 moti baat logon main chali gai he ki kaale dhan ke kilaaf aitihaasik karrwai hui he
 Five hundred and thousand notes have ceased
 kai tarah ke sawaalon ko andekha kiya ja rahaa he
 Why are only the poor and common people upset in the pictures of TV and newspapers
 jabaki yahi ve log hai, jo puure man se sarkaar kaa samarthan bhi kar rahe hai
 Black money has been erased, if it is claimed then where are all the facts
 agar udyog jagat or kaarobaar jagat ke paas kaala dhan tha, to unke bich saarvajanik haahaakaar kyon nahin he
 Why the government is not telling anything about them, so that people standing in the queue can be more patient that they are historically performing their national responsibility
 teen lakh karod ke aankade se ek chhavi to banati he, magar vah asli tasviir nahin he
 After three lakh crores, this amount can reach 10 lakh crores
 ho saktaa he ki kaaphi paisa saamaanya kaarobaari gatividhiyon kaa ho
 Has he also been included in three lakh crores
 notebandi se pehle bainkon main aamtaur par kitne lakh karod rupee jamaa ho rahe the

 (input - IANS) neshnal film aword main raashtrapati ke haathon sabhi vijetaon ko sammaan na die jane kaa vivaad charchaa main he
 In protest, more than four dozen artists boycotted the ceremony
 virodh kar rahe kalakaaron kaa aarope tha ki unhen pehle bataaya gaya tha ki raashtrapati ke haathon sammanit kiya jayega, lekin aisa hua nahin
 Let us know that only 11 artists got the honor from President Ramnath Kovind in the event held on Thursday
 baaki kalakaaron ko kendriya mantri smriti irani, kendriya rajyamantri rajya vardhan singh rathore ne sammanit kiya
 Citing sources, the Indian Express has said in a report that Rashtrapati Bhavan is unhappy with the controversy over the whole matter, as the President's Secretariat was in contact with the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting regarding the event since early March
 ye pehle se hi tay tha ki raashtrapati event main sirf ek ghanta hi bithaayenge, isliye ve sabhi kalakaaron ko apane haathon aword nahin denge
 The controversy over the National Film Awards ceremony, according to the refusal to receive the 68 winners, was finalized after the talks by the end of March
 ye ministry par choda gaya tha ki kitne logon ko raashtrapati aword denge or kise manch par sammanit kiya jayega
 However, if the protesting artists are to be believed, then in the invitation letter sent by the Ministry to the winning artists, it was written that the President will give this honor with his own hands
 lekin samaaroh se thik pehle sirf 11 kalakaaron ko raashtrapati dwaara sammaan milane kii baat kalakaaron ko pataa chali
 Subsequently, the 120 winning artists wrote to the film festival's Additional Director General Chaitanya Prasad and the President's Office that they would not participate in the award ceremony
 kai vijeta kalakaaron ne baithak kar aword lene se manaa kar diya
 After the protest, a statement was issued from the President's office and an attempt was made to explain the whole thing
 kendriya mantri ne bhi kalakaaron se baatcheet kar bich kaa rasta nikaalane kaa prayaas kiya
 But in the end many artists did not take the awards as a protest
 rashtriya puraskaar ke itihaas main ye vivaad apni tarah se alag tha
 Many seats left vacant in the National Award Ceremony, who is responsible? Oscar-winning sound designer Resul Pookutty expressed displeasure in the matter saying, if the Indian government cannot give even three hours of time in our honor, then they should give us the National Award Should not bother hamaare 50 fisadi se zyada paseene kii kamai aap manoranjan kar ke rup main le lete hai, hamaari jo pratishtha he kam se kam uskaa to sammaan kiijie

 ylaan kaa koi mulk nahin ho sakaa
 In an unknown country, Samudra becomes his mother and Samadar is his father
 rahane ke liye chaar gaj jameen nahin mili
 Samandar shelters her in her embrace
 teen saal ke ylaan ko bhala maaloom bhi kya hoga
 Totli would have been able to take only the names of father and mother from tongue
 usee alan ko ek anjaane mulk main chat nahin mili
 But when he died, the sky became the roof for him
 alan kurdiko aap nahin jaanate 
 Or even if you know, what difference does it make
 sivaa iske ki wo ek rifuji baccha tha
 Was from Syria
 apane mulk main katlogarat se bachane ke liye uskaa parivaar dar dar bhatak rahaa tha
 Aylan Kurdi did not know the rules of life
 insaaniyat ke takaaje bhi bhala kya pataa rahe honge
 Hardly he must have learned to walk
 tutala kar bolnaa shuru hi to kiya hoga
 Father would be swinging on his shoulders when he came from office
 mamma daantati hongi to kisi or kamare main chhip jaataa hoga
 Why was Alan's world snatched again? Today, the whole world is shocked
 shame aati he is hatyari vyavastha par jahaan koi alan muskuraana to chhodie, salike se jindagi ji bhi nahin saktaaaj alan ke matam main karodon ankhen baras rahi hai
 Millions of people are shattered
 lekin islan kabhi is neend se nahin jaagega
 He has slept forever tired of the attitude of the world
 alan ho sake to hamen maaf kar dena
 We did not deserve you
 ye duniya tumhaare kaabil nahin thi
 Life will continue
 lekin vakt ke haashiye par samandar kinare tumhaari laash hameshaa ke liye kisi isa kii tarah saleeb par tangi rahegi

 After removing India from the first place in the Test rankings, England wicketkeeper Matt Prior feels that his team should now be ready for the toughest challenges
 bharat ke khilaaf shandaar pradarshan ke baad sheersh par kabja jamaane vaali england ke khilaadi praayar ne kaha ki is sthaan par pahunchane ke kaaran ab unhen pehle se adhik chunautiyaan milengi

 "we have to play a Test series against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates and then a Test series in Sri Lanka," he said
 lekin isaki taiyaari pehle hi shuru ho chuki he
 Prior said he felt that now that England had become the number one Test team, he would get a tough challenge from international teams
 unhone kaha, jab aap duniya kii number ek team ke khilaaf ho, to koi bhi aapako haraana chahta he
 People target you, so you have to keep improving your game
 praayar ne kaha, isse (number ek ranking se) kuch dabaav banataa he, lekin hamane duniya kii purv number ek team bharat ke khilaaf is shrunkhlaa main ise nahin banane diya

 After taking the oath of office of the Chief Minister of Karnataka, now the challenge of fulfilling the election promises has arisen in front of HD Kumaraswamy
 unke saamne sabase pehle soobe ke kisaanon ke 53 hajaar karod rupee ke karj ko maaf karne kii chunauti he
 During the Karnataka Assembly elections, the JDS had promised that the farm loan of Rs 53 thousand crore would be waived within 24 hours of forming the government in the state
 kumaraswami ne shapath lene ke baad kaha, 'main yah nahin kahata hum ki main lone maaf nahin karuunga
 i said that we will forgive all the loans when our party comes into government
 lekin ab main gathbandhan kii sarkaar main hum isliye ab mujhe unhen bhi vishwaas main lenaa hoga
 By the way i have its blueprint
 main congress netaaon se isapar charchaa karuunga
 That means Kumaraswamy has not said anything clearly on the debt waiver of farmers
 aapako bataa den ki isse pehle dhai din ke liye yediaruppa siem bane the or unhone mukhyamantri pad kii shapath lene ke baad kaha tha, 'apane vaade ke mutabik main kisaanon ke karjamaafee kaa elaan karata hum
 'he had waived up to 1 lakh loans of farmers
 haalanki, bahumat sabit na kar paane kii vajah se unki sarkaar gir gai or karjamaafee kaa faisla amal main nahin aa sakaa
 Let me tell you that debt waiver of farmers has been a big electoral issue in Karnataka
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne apni reliyon main purv siem siddharmaiya par kisaanon kii karjamaafee kii kaaphi charchaa kii thi
 Now the Congress is a supporting party in this government and holds the post of deputy CM
 congress ke pradesh adhyaksh rahe ji parameshwar ko dipti siem banaaya gaya he
 In such a situation, there will be pressure on both parties regarding loan waiver of farmers
 jedies ke chunavi menifesto main kaha gaya tha ki agarkumaraswami mukhyamantribanate hai or karnataka kii satta main aate hai, to 24 ghante ke bheetar byaaj sahit 53 hajaar karod rupee ke krishi karj maaf kiye jaaenge
 Now Kumaraswamy has become the Chief Minister and JDS government has also been formed in the state
 haalanki yah sarkaar gathbandhan kii he yani jedies ne congress ke saath milakar sarkaar kaa gathan kiya he
 In fact, no political party got a clear majority in this election and BJP emerged as the single largest party by winning 104 seats
 vahiin, congress ko 78 siton or jedies ko 37 siton par jeet mili
 In the event of not getting a clear majority in Karnataka, Governor Vajubhai Vala, who emerged as the largest party, invited BJP to form the government and administered the oath of Chief Minister to BS Yeddyurappa
 haalanki rajyapal ke is faisle ke khilaaf jedies or congress supreme court pahunch gaye
 The apex court, while hearing the plea of both the parties, asked Yeddyurappa to prove his majority in the assembly within 28 hours or till 4 pm on Saturday evening, but he could not gather the magic figures required for majority and resigned from the post of chief minister
 iske baad rajyapal vajubhai vaala nagedies-congress gathbandhanako sarkaar banane kaa nyotaa diya or buudhvaar ko kumaraswami ko mukhyamantri va ji parameshwar ko up mukhyamantri pad kii shapath dilaai
 In this way, the jds-congress coalition government was formed in the state
 ab yah dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki kumaraswami apane chunavi vaade ko 24 ghante ke andar puraa karte hai yaa nahin
 At present, a clear announcement has not been made by Kumaraswamy
