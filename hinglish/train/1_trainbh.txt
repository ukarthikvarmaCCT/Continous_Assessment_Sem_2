digvijay singh− rahul gandhi ji ko kya−kya nahin kaha gaya, sonia ji ko kya nahin kaha gaya, kya ham usase vichlit ho jaaen humlog vichlit nahin hote
 Narendra Modi ji gets distracted
 aapako yaad he karan thapar ne jab unase kuch prashn puche to ve nikalakar baahar chale gaye
 Name any one Congress leader who has misbehaved
 ham saamana karnaa jaanate hai
 These Sangh people do not know
 manoranjan bharti− aapako lagata he ki ye soshal media belgaum ho saktaa he? Digvijay Singh - Freedom of thought exists in every democracy
 hamaare yahaan iske liye kanoon bana hua he or kanoon ke daayre main rahakar kaam karnaa chahie
 Manoranjan Bharti- You think that Shivraj Singh Chauhan is pointing out that Modi's supporters are not bjp's supporters
 digvijay singh− mujhe unke jhagade main nahin padana
 Recreation Bharti- Are you preparing for the election by assuming Rahul vs Modi? digvijay singh− modi hamaare liye koi mudda nahin hai
 Our fight is a battle of ideology
 hamaari ladaai unalogon se he jis vichaardhaara ne mahatma gandhi kii hatya karai thi jis vichaardhaara ne sampradayik sadbhaav ko bigaada jisane desh main alpsankhyak samudaay ko badnaam karne ke liye bam phode
 The Battle of Radical Ideology
 congress party aazaadee ke pehle se ladati ai he or aage bhi ladegi
 Manoranjan Bharti- You do not think that if you will counter Modi's point to point, then the truth is known immediately
 digvijay singh− desh ke rajyon ke jo indicaters hai chaahe human devlepment index ho chaahe par capita incum ho chaahe epadiai ho chaahe manuphaccharing sactor main investment ho chaahe implementation of anual yuj ho, ek bhi criteria main gujarat number van par nahin he
 If you look at the Human Development Index, Kerala is at number one where the Congress government is there
 par capita incum dekhenge to haryana number van par he jahaan congress kaa raaj he
 In the manufacturing sector and FDI, Maharashtra is at number one
 gujarat koun se stage par number van par he
 Maximum malnutrition is increasing there, the number of women is decreasing there
 jo growth rate he gujarat kaa wo hameshaa bharat ke growth rate se 2−4 zyada rahaa he
 Double digit growth has been in Gujarat even in the 90s
 iskaa shrey modi ko nahin jaataa he
 The credit goes to the industrialists of Gujarat
 manoranjan bharti− aapako lagata he ki industrialist chaahate hai ki modi piem bane? Digvijay Singh - to whom he has given crores of land for free, to whom he has given the benefit of thousands of crores in tax, if he does not praise them, then whom will he do
 manoranjan bharti−aap 2014 kaa chunaav ladenge? If Digvijay Singh-party gives the ticket then he will definitely fight
 manoranjan bharti− matlab aap taiyaar hai? Digvijay Singh - will fight anywhere from here
 manoranjan bharti− 2014 main upi main aapaki siton kii sankhya jas kii tas rahegi
 Digvijay Singh - It cannot be said, but the preparations are complete and will fight the elections firmly
 manoranjan bharti− kya priyanka chunaav ladegi?tippaniyan Digvijay Singh - i have no idea
 manoranjan bharti− party main ek hi power centre hona chahie? Digvijay Singh- i have said my point and i am following what the official spokesperson has said
 digvijay singh− mulaayam singh ko mujhase behatar aap jaanate hai
 Manoranjan Bharti- UPA-2 will have to prepare for a confidence vote by the end of this year
 kya aap maanate hai is theuri ko? Digvijay Singh- In the past, such threats have come many times and our party has faced these threats and we have won
 jab samay aayega tab dekha jayega
 Manoranjan Bharti- Do you think that even if Mulayam Singh moves away, will the Congress have sufficient numbers? digvijay singh− yah badaan hipothetical prashn he
 Mulayam Singh has given this statement that we do not want to topple the government
 manoranjan bharti− rahul netritv karne se peeche hatate kyon dikh rahe hai? Digvijay Singh - He was addressing the Annual General Meeting of CII
 isamen desh ke saamne kya samasyaayein hai, in samasyaon ke nidaan ke liye kya vijan hona chahie, is par vistaar se unhone apni baat rakhi he
 The core belief of the Congress, which has been since Mahatma Gandhi's time, is that there should be decentralization of power and only decentralized power can solve the problems
 jaipur ke adhiveshan main unhone kaha tha 'power ij poijan'
 Therefore, his mother Soniaji had said that to use power to mpower others, not to do own mpower
 ye bahut badi baat he
 This is the basic difference between the ideology of Congress and bjp-sangh
 manoranjan bharti− desh jaananaa chahta he ki rahul kab tak desh kaa netritv karne ke liye taiyaar honge
 Digvijay Singh- You want to increase your TRP by arguing on who will become the Prime Minister
 hamaare saamne yah samasya nahin he ki koun banegaa pradhanmantri
 Our problem is that how will we remove unemployment, how will we eradicate poverty, how to eradicate malnutrition, how to improve the human development index, how to increase the growth rate, how we will be able to create a good environment
 , Which not only brings FDI, but also in the manufacturing sector, we can increase maximum growth
 kaise ham log skill devlepment ke sahare jo upie sarkaar kii bahut badi uplabdhi he, kaise ham uske madhyam se logon ko rojgaar de saken, kaise ham log jis tarah se rhite tu information diya, rhite tu ajukeshan diya, rhite tu work diya, ab rhite tu foot ham logon ne diya he
 Manoranjan Bharati - Is it anything more theatrical? digvijay singh− bilkul nahin
 There was no speech of CM or PM
 vaais president of congress party kaa bhaashan tha
 Everybody in the country wanted to know whether Rahul Gandhi is the brand? The Rahul Gandhi brand was expressed in the speech
 manoranjan bharti− soshal media ke tahat 14 karod logon se aapaki party kab judegi? Digvijay Singh - FICCI was the women's wing program
 sangh sanchaalak jo hote hai wo shaadi−shuda nahin hote hai
 Now this is also a very big question whether they are married or not
 ye chunaav ladane ke liye jo form bharte hai, usamen bhi gupt rakhte hai ki ye shaadi−shuda hai yaa nahin
 The first thing is that the people of this country and especially the women class want to know that Modi ji should make it clear whether you are married or not
 duusari baat yah he ki wo mahilaon ko kehete hai ki mahilaayein desh kaa ham logon kaa purusharth jaagrit karen
 This itself shows the Sangh's mindset
 ham mahila shakti ko badhanaa chaahate hai
 If anyone has contributed to increase women's power in this country, then it is the Congress
 rajeev gandhi ne mahilaon ko aarakshan diya
 As much as decisions have been taken in favor of women in the country, all Congress state governments and the central government have taken it
 bhaajapa ne kuch nahin kiya he
 i want to ask Modi that in the list of 35 states, your state is at number 32 in the ratio of male-female
 aap ke yahaan mahilaon kii sankhya ghat rahi he
 This means that the incidence of female feticide is increasing in your home and you do not answer it and you give speeches to women like Sangh Pracharak
 ham to chahenge ki modi khub bhaashan den taaki desh kii janata ko maaloom to pade ki rata−rataya bhaashan kitna din sunenge wo yashoda ben ke pizza kii baat kyon nahin karte
 Ask them who is Yashoda Ben? manoranjan bharti− matlab wo is sabha main bhaawanaaon se khel rahe the The speech of Digvijay singh-sangh Pracharak is like this
 sangh ke logon kii training is prakaar hoti he ki taange ke ghode kii tarah sirf sadak par dekho or aas−paas mat dekho
 Manoranjan Bharti - Did Modi's speech speak of Soniaji in Modi's speech? digvijay singh− agar wo mahilaon kii izzat karnaa chaahate hai to sushamaa swaraj ko agle pradhanmantri ke rup main sweekaar kar len
 Manoranjan Bharti- When will you reply to Modi on social media? digvijay singh− hamaara sangharsh kisi vyakti se nahin he
 Our fight is against ideology
 soshal media par jo sangh kii vichaardhaara he aaj mahatma gandhi ke murder ko jastiphai karti he
 Mahatma tells Gandhi's murder that healed
 kya iskaa ham log virodh naa karen
 Every citizen of the country, who is of the Liberal ideology, who is of the communal harmony ideology, we will continue to oppose the growing influence of the Sangh ideology on this social media
 manoranjan bharti− kaise karenge, aapke log to he nahin vahaan par
 Digvijay Singh - Our people are all over the country and gradually our penetration is increasing
 jo chah maheene pehle sangh kaa dabadabaa tha aaj wo nahin he or chah maheene baad dekhenge ki wo kahaan khadey hai
 Manoranjan Bharti- You might not have liked it when Rahul Gandhi was called Pappu
 digvijay singh− rahul gandhi ji ko kya−kya nahin kaha gaya, sonia ji ko kya nahin kaha gaya, kya ham usase vichlit ho jaaen humlog vichlit nahin hote
 Narendra Modi ji gets distracted
 aapako yaad he karan thapar ne jab unase kuch prashn puche to ve nikalakar baahar chale gaye
 Name any one Congress leader who has misbehaved
 ham saamana karnaa jaanate hai
 These Sangh people do not know
 manoranjan bharti− aapako lagata he ki ye soshal media belgaum ho saktaa he? Digvijay Singh - Freedom of thought exists in every democracy
 hamaare yahaan iske liye kanoon bana hua he or kanoon ke daayre main rahakar kaam karnaa chahie
 Manoranjan Bharti- You think that Shivraj Singh Chauhan is pointing out that Modi's supporters are not bjp's supporters
 digvijay singh− mujhe unke jhagade main nahin padana
 Recreation Bharti- Are you preparing for the election by assuming Rahul vs Modi? digvijay singh− modi hamaare liye koi mudda nahin hai
 Our fight is a battle of ideology
 hamaari ladaai unalogon se he jis vichaardhaara ne mahatma gandhi kii hatya karai thi jis vichaardhaara ne sampradayik sadbhaav ko bigaada jisane desh main alpsankhyak samudaay ko badnaam karne ke liye bam phode
 The Battle of Radical Ideology
 congress party aazaadee ke pehle se ladati ai he or aage bhi ladegi
 Manoranjan Bharti- You do not think that if you will counter Modi's point to point, then the truth is known immediately
 digvijay singh− desh ke rajyon ke jo indicaters hai chaahe human devlepment index ho chaahe par capita incum ho chaahe epadiai ho chaahe manuphaccharing sactor main investment ho chaahe implementation of anual yuj ho, ek bhi criteria main gujarat number van par nahin he

 iskaa shrey modi ko nahin jaataa he
 The credit goes to the industrialists of Gujarat
 manoranjan bharti− aapako lagata he ki industrialist chaahate hai ki modi piem bane? Digvijay Singh - to whom he has given crores of land for free, to whom he has given the benefit of thousands of crores in tax, if he does not praise them, then whom will he do
 manoranjan bharti−aap 2014 kaa chunaav ladenge? If Digvijay Singh-party gives the ticket then he will definitely fight

 manoranjan bharti− kya priyanka chunaav ladegi?tippaniyan Digvijay Singh - i have no idea
 manoranjan bharti− party main ek hi power centre hona chahie? Digvijay Singh- i have said my point and i am following what the official spokesperson has said
 digvijay singh− pehle bhi aise khatre kai baar aae hai or hamaari party ne in khataron kaa saamana bhi kiya he or ham jite bhi hai
 Will be seen when the time comes
 manoranjan bharti− aapako lagata he ki yadi mulaayam singh hatate bhi hai to congress ke paas paryaapt number rahegaa? Digvijay Singh - This is a big hypothetical question
 mulaayam singh ne yah bayaan diya he ki ham sarkaar nahin giraanaa chaahate
 Manoranjan Bharti - Why does Rahul seem to back down from leading? digvijay singh− wo siaiai ke anual general meeting ko sambodhit kar rahe the
 In this, he has given his views on the problems facing the country, what should be the vision to solve these problems
 congress kii mul dharna jo mahatma gandhi ke samay se rahi hai ki satta kaa vikendrikaran hona chahie or vikendrikrut satta hi samasyaon kaa nidaan kar sakati he
 In the Jaipur session, he said 'power is poison'
 isliye unki maa sonia ji ne kaha tha ki power kaa upyog dusron ko empower karne ke liye karnaa khud ke empower karne ke liye nahin karnaa
 This is a big deal
 yahi buniyadi antar he kangras or bhaajapa-sangh kii vichaardhaara main
 Manoranjan Bharati - The country wants to know how long Rahul will be ready to lead the country
 digvijay singh− aap log koun banegaa pradhanmantri isi par bahes karke apni tiarapy badhanaa chaahate hai
 We do not have a problem as to who will become the Prime Minister
 hamaari samasya yah he ki kaise ham log berogari dur karenge, kaise ham garibi dur karenge, kaise yahaan kaa kuposhan dur karenge, kaise yahaan ke human devlepment indax main sudhaar karenge, kaise growth rate ko badha paaenge, kaise ham ek acha vaataavaran nirmit kar paaenge, jisase naa keval epadiai aae, saath hi manuphaccharing sector main bhi ham zyada se zyada growth badha saken
 How can we employ people through skill development, which is a great achievement of the UPA government, how can we give employment to people through it, how we were given the right to information, right to education, right to work, now right We have given two feet
 manoranjan bharti− kahin yah kuch zyada thurytical to nahin he? Digvijay Singh - Absolutely not
 siem yaa piem kaa bhaashan nahin tha
 Vice President of Congress Party was the speech
 desh kaa har vyakti yah jaananaa chahta tha ki aakhir rahul gandhi brands he kya? bhaashan main rahul gandhi brands hi usamen vyakt kiya gaya
 Manoranjan Bharti- When will your party connect with 14 crore people under social media? digvijay singh− fikki mahila wing kaa kyrkram tha
 Those who are union directors are not married
 ab ye bhi ek bahut bada prashn he ki ye shaadi−shuda hai yaa nahin
 In the form they fill in to contest elections, they also keep secret whether they are married or not
 pehali baat to yah he ki is desh kii janata or visheshkar mahila varg yah jaananaa chahta he ki modi ji aap ye spasht kar den ki aap shaadi−shuda hai yaa nahin
 The second thing is that they tell women that women should awaken the efforts of the people of the country
 yahi apane aap main sangh kii maansikta ko jaahir karata he
 We want to increase female power
 is desh main mahila shakti badhaane main kisi kaa yogadan rahaa he to congress kaa he
 Rajiv Gandhi gave reservation to women
 jitna bhi desh main mahilaon ke paksh main nirnay hue hai sabhi congress ke rajya sarkaron or centre sarkaar ne liya he
 BJP has done nothing
 main poochna chahta hum modi se ki 35 rajyon kii list main aapke rajya main mail−femail ke anupaat main 32wein number par he
 The number of women is decreasing with you
 iskaa matlab yahi he ki aapke yahaan kanya bhrun hatya kii ghatnaayen bad rahi hai iskaa uttar nahin dete hai or aap mahilaon se sangh prachaarak kii tarah bhaashan dete hai
 We would like Modi to give a lot of speeches so that the people of the country will know how long they will listen to the rhetorical speech, why they do not talk about Yashoda Ben's pizza
 unase puuchhie ki yashoda ben koun hai? Manoranjan Bharati - meaning he was playing with emotions in this gathering digvijay singh− sangh prachaarak kaa bhaashan isi prakaar rata−rataya hota he
 The people of the Sangh are trained in such a way that just look at the road like a horse of a horse and do not look around
 manoranjan bharti− kya modi ke bhaashan main sonia ji kii baat karnaa bul gaye? Digvijay Singh - If he wants to respect women, then accept Sushma Swaraj as the next Prime Minister
 manoranjan bharti− aap soshal media par modi ko kab jawaab denge? Digvijay Singh - Our struggle is not with any person
 hamaari ladaai vichaardhaara se he
 Today, the ideology of the Sangh on social media justifies Mahatma Gandhi's murder
 mahatma gandhi ke murder ko kahati he ki thik hua
 Should we not oppose it? desh kaa har naagarik jo libral vichaardhaara kaa he jo sampradayik sadbhaav vichaardhaara kaa he, is soshal media par jo sangh kii vichaardhaara kaa prabhaav badhata ja rahaa he uskaa ham nirantar virodh karenge
 Manoranjan Bharati - How will your people not be there? digvijay singh− hamaare log puure desh main hai or dhire−dhire hamaara jo penitrishan he bad rahaa he
 What was dominating the Sangh six months ago is no more today and after six months will see where they stand
 manoranjan bharti− aapako acha nahin laga hoga jab rahul gandhi ko pappu kaha gaya hoga
 Digvijay Singh- What was not told to Rahul Gandhiji, what was not told to Soniaji, should we get distracted by that, we do not get distracted
 narendra modi ji vichlit ho jate hai
 Do you remember when Karan Thapar asked him some questions, he went out
 kisi bhi ek congress netaa kaa naam bataaen jisane badasluki kii ho
 We know how to cope
 ye sangh ke log nahin jaanate
 Manoranjan Bharati- Do you think this social media can be unbridled? digvijay singh− vichaaron kii azaadi har prajatantr main hoti he
 We have a law for this and we should work within the scope of the law
 manoranjan bharti− aapako lagata he ki shivaraj singh chouhan yah ishaara kar rahe hai ki modi ke samarthak bijepi ke samarthak nahin hai
 Digvijay Singh - i do not get into a fight with him
 manoranjan bharti− rahul banaam modi ko maanakar aap chunaav kii taiyaari kar rahe hai? Digvijay Singh- Modi is not an issue for us
 hamaari ladaai vichaardhaara kii ladaai he
 Our fight is against the people who killed Mahatma Gandhi, the ideology that ruined the communal harmony, which exploded bombs to discredit the minority community in the country
 kattarpanthi vichaardhaara kii ladaai
 The Congress party has been fighting since independence and will fight even further
 manoranjan bharti− aapako nahin lagata ki agar aap modi kii baton ko point tu point counter karenge to turant sachai pataa chalata he
 Digvijay Singh - Indicators of the states of the country, whether it is a Human Development Index, whether it is Capita Income, FDI, Investment in Manufacturing Sector or Implementation of Annual Use, Gujarat is not number one in any criterion
 agar aap human devlepment index dekhenge to kerala number van par he jahaan congress kii sarkaar he
 But if we look at the capita income, Haryana is at number one where the Congress is ruling
 manuphaccharing sactor or epadiai main dekhenge to maharashtra number van par he
 Gujarat is number one on which stage
 sabase zyada kuposhan vahiin bad rahaa he, sabase zyada mahilaon kii sankhya vahiin ghat rahi he
 Gujarat's growth rate has always been 2–4 more than India's growth rate
 dabl disit growth to gujarat main 90 ke dashak main bhi rahaa he
 The credit does not go to Modi
 iskaa shrey gujarat ke udyogpatiyon ko jaataa he
 Manoranjan Bharati- Do you think that industrialists want Modi to become PM? digvijay singh− jinako unhonen muft main karodon kii zamin di hai, jinako unhone tex main hazaron karod kaa faaydaa diya he wo unka gungan nahin karenge to kiskaa karenge
 Manoranjan Bharti – will you contest the 2014 election? digvijay singh−party tikat degi to jarur ladenge
 Manoranjan Bharati - Are you ready? digvijay singh− yahaan se kahin bhi ladenge
 Manoranjan Bharti - Your number of seats in UP will remain the same in 2014
 digvijay singh− yah nahin kaha ja saktaa, par taiyaari puri he or datakar chunaav ladenge
 Entertainment Bharti- Will Priyanka contest elections? Comments digvijay singh− mujhe koi bhi jaankaree nahin he
 Manoranjan bharati-party should have only one power center? digvijay singh− main apni baat kah chukaa hum or oficial spoxperson ne jo baat kahi he main uskaa paalan kar rahaa hum
 Manoranjan Bharti- Do you think that even if Mulayam Singh moves away, will the Congress have sufficient numbers? digvijay singh− yah badaan hipothetical prashn he
 Mulayam Singh has given this statement that we do not want to topple the government
 manoranjan bharti− rahul netritv karne se peeche hatate kyon dikh rahe hai? Digvijay Singh - He was addressing the Annual General Meeting of CII
 isamen desh ke saamne kya samasyaayein hai, in samasyaon ke nidaan ke liye kya vijan hona chahie, is par vistaar se unhone apni baat rakhi he
 The core belief of the Congress, which has been since Mahatma Gandhi's time, is that there should be decentralization of power and only decentralized power can solve the problems

 This is the basic difference between the ideology of Congress and bjp-sangh
 manoranjan bharti− desh jaananaa chahta he ki rahul kab tak desh kaa netritv karne ke liye taiyaar honge
 Digvijay Singh- You want to increase your TRP by arguing on who will become the Prime Minister
 hamaare saamne yah samasya nahin he ki koun banegaa pradhanmantri
 Our problem is that how will we remove unemployment, how will we eradicate poverty, how to eradicate malnutrition, how to improve the human development index, how to increase the growth rate, how we will be able to create a good environment
 , Which not only brings FDI, but also in the manufacturing sector, we can increase maximum growth
 kaise ham log skill devlepment ke sahare jo upie sarkaar kii bahut badi uplabdhi he, kaise ham uske madhyam se logon ko rojgaar de saken, kaise ham log jis tarah se rhite tu information diya, rhite tu ajukeshan diya, rhite tu work diya, ab rhite tu foot ham logon ne diya he
 Manoranjan Bharati - Is it anything more theatrical? digvijay singh− bilkul nahin

 sangh ke logon kii training is prakaar hoti he ki taange ke ghode kii tarah sirf sadak par dekho or aas−paas mat dekho
 Manoranjan Bharti - Did Modi's speech speak of Soniaji in Modi's speech? digvijay singh− agar wo mahilaon kii izzat karnaa chaahate hai to sushamaa swaraj ko agle pradhanmantri ke rup main sweekaar kar len
 Manoranjan Bharti- When will you reply to Modi on social media? digvijay singh− hamaara sangharsh kisi vyakti se nahin he
 Our fight is against ideology

 Every citizen of the country, who is of the Liberal ideology, who is of the communal harmony ideology, we will continue to oppose the growing influence of the Sangh ideology on this social media
 manoranjan bharti− kaise karenge, aapke log to he nahin vahaan par
 Digvijay Singh - Our people are all over the country and gradually our penetration is increasing
 jo chah maheene pehle sangh kaa dabadabaa tha aaj wo nahin he or chah maheene baad dekhenge ki wo kahaan khadey hai
 Manoranjan Bharti- You might not have liked it when Rahul Gandhi was called Pappu
 digvijay singh− rahul gandhi ji ko kya−kya nahin kaha gaya, sonia ji ko kya nahin kaha gaya, kya ham usase vichlit ho jaaen humlog vichlit nahin hote
 Narendra Modi ji gets distracted
 aapako yaad he karan thapar ne jab unase kuch prashn puche to ve nikalakar baahar chale gaye
 Name any one Congress leader who has misbehaved
 ham saamana karnaa jaanate hai
 These Sangh people do not know
 manoranjan bharti− aapako lagata he ki ye soshal media belgaum ho saktaa he? Digvijay Singh - Freedom of thought exists in every democracy
 hamaare yahaan iske liye kanoon bana hua he or kanoon ke daayre main rahakar kaam karnaa chahie
 Manoranjan Bharti- You think that Shivraj Singh Chauhan is pointing out that Modi's supporters are not bjp's supporters
 digvijay singh− mujhe unke jhagade main nahin padana
 Recreation Bharti- Are you preparing for the election by assuming Rahul vs Modi? digvijay singh− modi hamaare liye koi mudda nahin hai
 Our fight is a battle of ideology
 hamaari ladaai unalogon se he jis vichaardhaara ne mahatma gandhi kii hatya karai thi jis vichaardhaara ne sampradayik sadbhaav ko bigaada jisane desh main alpsankhyak samudaay ko badnaam karne ke liye bam phode
 The Battle of Radical Ideology
 congress party aazaadee ke pehle se ladati ai he or aage bhi ladegi
 Manoranjan Bharti- You do not think that if you will counter Modi's point to point, then the truth is known immediately
 digvijay singh− desh ke rajyon ke jo indicaters hai chaahe human devlepment index ho chaahe par capita incum ho chaahe epadiai ho chaahe manuphaccharing sactor main investment ho chaahe implementation of anual yuj ho, ek bhi criteria main gujarat number van par nahin he
 If you look at the Human Development Index, Kerala is at number one where the Congress government is there
 par capita incum dekhenge to haryana number van par he jahaan congress kaa raaj he
 In the manufacturing sector and FDI, Maharashtra is at number one
 gujarat koun se stage par number van par he
 Maximum malnutrition is increasing there, the number of women is decreasing there
 jo growth rate he gujarat kaa wo hameshaa bharat ke growth rate se 2−4 zyada rahaa he
 Double digit growth has been in Gujarat even in the 90s
 iskaa shrey modi ko nahin jaataa he
 The credit goes to the industrialists of Gujarat
 manoranjan bharti− aapako lagata he ki industrialist chaahate hai ki modi piem bane? Digvijay Singh - to whom he has given crores of land for free, to whom he has given the benefit of thousands of crores in tax, if he does not praise them, then whom will he do
 manoranjan bharti−aap 2014 kaa chunaav ladenge? If Digvijay Singh-party gives the ticket then he will definitely fight
 manoranjan bharti− matlab aap taiyaar hai? Digvijay Singh - will fight anywhere from here
 manoranjan bharti− 2014 main upi main aapaki siton kii sankhya jas kii tas rahegi
 Digvijay Singh - It cannot be said, but the preparations are complete and will fight the elections firmly
 manoranjan bharti− kya priyanka chunaav ladegi?tippaniyan Digvijay Singh - i have no idea
 manoranjan bharti− party main ek hi power centre hona chahie? Digvijay Singh- i have said my point and i am following what the official spokesperson has said

 Mulayam Singh has given this statement that we do not want to topple the government
 manoranjan bharti− rahul netritv karne se peeche hatate kyon dikh rahe hai? Digvijay Singh - He was addressing the Annual General Meeting of CII
 isamen desh ke saamne kya samasyaayein hai, in samasyaon ke nidaan ke liye kya vijan hona chahie, is par vistaar se unhone apni baat rakhi he
 The core belief of the Congress, which has been since Mahatma Gandhi's time, is that there should be decentralization of power and only decentralized power can solve the problems
 jaipur ke adhiveshan main unhone kaha tha 'power ij poijan'
 Therefore, his mother Soniaji had said that to use power to mpower others, not to do own mpower
 ye bahut badi baat he
 This is the basic difference between the ideology of Congress and bjp-sangh
 manoranjan bharti− desh jaananaa chahta he ki rahul kab tak desh kaa netritv karne ke liye taiyaar honge
 Digvijay Singh- You want to increase your TRP by arguing on who will become the Prime Minister
 hamaare saamne yah samasya nahin he ki koun banegaa pradhanmantri
 Our problem is that how will we remove unemployment, how will we eradicate poverty, how to eradicate malnutrition, how to improve the human development index, how to increase the growth rate, how we will be able to create a good environment
 , Which not only brings FDI, but also in the manufacturing sector, we can increase maximum growth
 kaise ham log skill devlepment ke sahare jo upie sarkaar kii bahut badi uplabdhi he, kaise ham uske madhyam se logon ko rojgaar de saken, kaise ham log jis tarah se rhite tu information diya, rhite tu ajukeshan diya, rhite tu work diya, ab rhite tu foot ham logon ne diya he
 Manoranjan Bharati - Is it anything more theatrical? digvijay singh− bilkul nahin
 There was no speech of CM or PM
 vaais president of congress party kaa bhaashan tha
 Everybody in the country wanted to know whether Rahul Gandhi is the brand? The Rahul Gandhi brand was expressed in the speech
 manoranjan bharti− soshal media ke tahat 14 karod logon se aapaki party kab judegi? Digvijay Singh - FICCI was the women's wing program
 sangh sanchaalak jo hote hai wo shaadi−shuda nahin hote hai
 Now this is also a very big question whether they are married or not
 ye chunaav ladane ke liye jo form bharte hai, usamen bhi gupt rakhte hai ki ye shaadi−shuda hai yaa nahin
 The first thing is that the people of this country and especially the women class want to know that Modi ji should make it clear whether you are married or not
 duusari baat yah he ki wo mahilaon ko kehete hai ki mahilaayein desh kaa ham logon kaa purusharth jaagrit karen
 This itself shows the Sangh's mindset
 ham mahila shakti ko badhanaa chaahate hai
 If anyone has contributed to increase women's power in this country, then it is the Congress
 rajeev gandhi ne mahilaon ko aarakshan diya
 As much as decisions have been taken in favor of women in the country, all Congress state governments and the central government have taken it
 bhaajapa ne kuch nahin kiya he
 i want to ask Modi that in the list of 35 states, your state is at number 32 in the ratio of male-female
 aap ke yahaan mahilaon kii sankhya ghat rahi he
 This means that the incidence of female feticide is increasing in your home and you do not answer it and you give speeches to women like Sangh Pracharak
 ham to chahenge ki modi khub bhaashan den taaki desh kii janata ko maaloom to pade ki rata−rataya bhaashan kitna din sunenge wo yashoda ben ke pizza kii baat kyon nahin karte
 Ask them who is Yashoda Ben? manoranjan bharti− matlab wo is sabha main bhaawanaaon se khel rahe the The speech of Digvijay singh-sangh Pracharak is like this
 sangh ke logon kii training is prakaar hoti he ki taange ke ghode kii tarah sirf sadak par dekho or aas−paas mat dekho
 Manoranjan Bharti - Did Modi's speech speak of Soniaji in Modi's speech? digvijay singh− agar wo mahilaon kii izzat karnaa chaahate hai to sushamaa swaraj ko agle pradhanmantri ke rup main sweekaar kar len
 Manoranjan Bharti- When will you reply to Modi on social media? digvijay singh− hamaara sangharsh kisi vyakti se nahin he
 Our fight is against ideology
 soshal media par jo sangh kii vichaardhaara he aaj mahatma gandhi ke murder ko jastiphai karti he
 Mahatma tells Gandhi's murder that healed
 kya iskaa ham log virodh naa karen
 Every citizen of the country, who is of the Liberal ideology, who is of the communal harmony ideology, we will continue to oppose the growing influence of the Sangh ideology on this social media
 manoranjan bharti− kaise karenge, aapke log to he nahin vahaan par

 Narendra Modi ji gets distracted

 Name any one Congress leader who has misbehaved
 ham saamana karnaa jaanate hai
 These Sangh people do not know
 manoranjan bharti− aapako lagata he ki ye soshal media belgaum ho saktaa he? Digvijay Singh - Freedom of thought exists in every democracy
 hamaare yahaan iske liye kanoon bana hua he or kanoon ke daayre main rahakar kaam karnaa chahie
 Manoranjan Bharti- You think that Shivraj Singh Chauhan is pointing out that Modi's supporters are not bjp's supporters
 digvijay singh− mujhe unke jhagade main nahin padana
 Recreation Bharti- Are you preparing for the election by assuming Rahul vs Modi? digvijay singh− modi hamaare liye koi mudda nahin hai
 Our fight is a battle of ideology
 hamaari ladaai unalogon se he jis vichaardhaara ne mahatma gandhi kii hatya karai thi jis vichaardhaara ne sampradayik sadbhaav ko bigaada jisane desh main alpsankhyak samudaay ko badnaam karne ke liye bam phode
 The Battle of Radical Ideology

 In the manufacturing sector and FDI, Maharashtra is at number one
 gujarat koun se stage par number van par he
 Maximum malnutrition is increasing there, the number of women is decreasing there
 jo growth rate he gujarat kaa wo hameshaa bharat ke growth rate se 2−4 zyada rahaa he
 Double digit growth has been in Gujarat even in the 90s
 iskaa shrey modi ko nahin jaataa he
 The credit goes to the industrialists of Gujarat
 manoranjan bharti− aapako lagata he ki industrialist chaahate hai ki modi piem bane? Digvijay Singh - to whom he has given crores of land for free, to whom he has given the benefit of thousands of crores in tax, if he does not praise them, then whom will he do
 manoranjan bharti−aap 2014 kaa chunaav ladenge? If Digvijay Singh-party gives the ticket then he will definitely fight
 manoranjan bharti− matlab aap taiyaar hai? Digvijay Singh - will fight anywhere from here

 In the Jaipur session, he said 'power is poison'

 The Congress party has been fighting since independence and will fight even further
 manoranjan bharti− aapako nahin lagata ki agar aap modi kii baton ko point tu point counter karenge to turant sachai pataa chalata he
 Digvijay Singh - Indicators of the states of the country, whether it is a Human Development Index, whether it is Capita Income, FDI, Investment in Manufacturing Sector or Implementation of Annual Use, Gujarat is not number one in any criterion
 agar aap human devlepment index dekhenge to kerala number van par he jahaan congress kii sarkaar he
 But if we look at the capita income, Haryana is at number one where the Congress is ruling
 manuphaccharing sactor or epadiai main dekhenge to maharashtra number van par he
 Gujarat is number one on which stage
 sabase zyada kuposhan vahiin bad rahaa he, sabase zyada mahilaon kii sankhya vahiin ghat rahi he
 Gujarat's growth rate has always been 2–4 more than India's growth rate
 dabl disit growth to gujarat main 90 ke dashak main bhi rahaa he
 The credit does not go to Modi
 iskaa shrey gujarat ke udyogpatiyon ko jaataa he
 Manoranjan Bharati- Do you think that industrialists want Modi to become PM? digvijay singh− jinako unhonen muft main karodon kii zamin di hai, jinako unhone tex main hazaron karod kaa faaydaa diya he wo unka gungan nahin karenge to kiskaa karenge
 Manoranjan Bharti – will you contest the 2014 election? digvijay singh−party tikat degi to jarur ladenge

 We have a law for this and we should work within the scope of the law
 manoranjan bharti− aapako lagata he ki shivaraj singh chouhan yah ishaara kar rahe hai ki modi ke samarthak bijepi ke samarthak nahin hai
 Digvijay Singh - i do not get into a fight with him
 manoranjan bharti− rahul banaam modi ko maanakar aap chunaav kii taiyaari kar rahe hai? Digvijay Singh- Modi is not an issue for us
 hamaari ladaai vichaardhaara kii ladaai he
 Our fight is against the people who killed Mahatma Gandhi, the ideology that ruined the communal harmony, which exploded bombs to discredit the minority community in the country
 kattarpanthi vichaardhaara kii ladaai
 The Congress party has been fighting since independence and will fight even further
 manoranjan bharti− aapako nahin lagata ki agar aap modi kii baton ko point tu point counter karenge to turant sachai pataa chalata he
 Digvijay Singh - Indicators of the states of the country, whether it is a Human Development Index, whether it is Capita Income, FDI, Investment in Manufacturing Sector or Implementation of Annual Use, Gujarat is not number one in any criterion
 agar aap human devlepment index dekhenge to kerala number van par he jahaan congress kii sarkaar he
 But if we look at the capita income, Haryana is at number one where the Congress is ruling
 manuphaccharing sactor or epadiai main dekhenge to maharashtra number van par he
 Gujarat is number one on which stage
 sabase zyada kuposhan vahiin bad rahaa he, sabase zyada mahilaon kii sankhya vahiin ghat rahi he
 Gujarat's growth rate has always been 2–4 more than India's growth rate
 dabl disit growth to gujarat main 90 ke dashak main bhi rahaa he
 The credit does not go to Modi
 iskaa shrey gujarat ke udyogpatiyon ko jaataa he
 Manoranjan Bharati- Do you think that industrialists want Modi to become PM? digvijay singh− jinako unhonen muft main karodon kii zamin di hai, jinako unhone tex main hazaron karod kaa faaydaa diya he wo unka gungan nahin karenge to kiskaa karenge
 Manoranjan Bharti – will you contest the 2014 election? digvijay singh−party tikat degi to jarur ladenge
 Manoranjan Bharati - Are you ready? digvijay singh− yahaan se kahin bhi ladenge
 Manoranjan Bharti - Your number of seats in UP will remain the same in 2014
 digvijay singh− yah nahin kaha ja saktaa, par taiyaari puri he or datakar chunaav ladenge
 Entertainment Bharti- Will Priyanka contest elections? Comments digvijay singh− mujhe koi bhi jaankaree nahin he
 Manoranjan bharati-party should have only one power center? digvijay singh− main apni baat kah chukaa hum or oficial spoxperson ne jo baat kahi he main uskaa paalan kar rahaa hum
 Digvijay Singh- You want to increase your TRP by arguing on who will become the Prime Minister
 hamaare saamne yah samasya nahin he ki koun banegaa pradhanmantri
 Our problem is that how will we remove unemployment, how will we eradicate poverty, how to eradicate malnutrition, how to improve the human development index, how to increase the growth rate, how we will be able to create a good environment
 , Which not only brings FDI, but also in the manufacturing sector, we can increase maximum growth
 kaise ham log skill devlepment ke sahare jo upie sarkaar kii bahut badi uplabdhi he, kaise ham uske madhyam se logon ko rojgaar de saken, kaise ham log jis tarah se rhite tu information diya, rhite tu ajukeshan diya, rhite tu work diya, ab rhite tu foot ham logon ne diya he
 Manoranjan Bharati - Is it anything more theatrical? digvijay singh− bilkul nahin
 There was no speech of CM or PM
 vaais president of congress party kaa bhaashan tha
 Everybody in the country wanted to know whether Rahul Gandhi is the brand? The Rahul Gandhi brand was expressed in the speech
 manoranjan bharti− soshal media ke tahat 14 karod logon se aapaki party kab judegi? Digvijay Singh - FICCI was the women's wing program
 sangh sanchaalak jo hote hai wo shaadi−shuda nahin hote hai
 Now this is also a very big question whether they are married or not
 ye chunaav ladane ke liye jo form bharte hai, usamen bhi gupt rakhte hai ki ye shaadi−shuda hai yaa nahin
 The first thing is that the people of this country and especially the women class want to know that Modi ji should make it clear whether you are married or not
 duusari baat yah he ki wo mahilaon ko kehete hai ki mahilaayein desh kaa ham logon kaa purusharth jaagrit karen
 This itself shows the Sangh's mindset
 ham mahila shakti ko badhanaa chaahate hai
 If anyone has contributed to increase women's power in this country, then it is the Congress
 rajeev gandhi ne mahilaon ko aarakshan diya
 As much as decisions have been taken in favor of women in the country, all Congress state governments and the central government have taken it
 bhaajapa ne kuch nahin kiya he
 i want to ask Modi that in the list of 35 states, your state is at number 32 in the ratio of male-female
 aap ke yahaan mahilaon kii sankhya ghat rahi he
 This means that the incidence of female feticide is increasing in your home and you do not answer it and you give speeches to women like Sangh Pracharak
 ham to chahenge ki modi khub bhaashan den taaki desh kii janata ko maaloom to pade ki rata−rataya bhaashan kitna din sunenge wo yashoda ben ke pizza kii baat kyon nahin karte
 Ask them who is Yashoda Ben? manoranjan bharti− matlab wo is sabha main bhaawanaaon se khel rahe the The speech of Digvijay singh-sangh Pracharak is like this
 sangh ke logon kii training is prakaar hoti he ki taange ke ghode kii tarah sirf sadak par dekho or aas−paas mat dekho
 Manoranjan Bharti - Did Modi's speech speak of Soniaji in Modi's speech? digvijay singh− agar wo mahilaon kii izzat karnaa chaahate hai to sushamaa swaraj ko agle pradhanmantri ke rup main sweekaar kar len
 Manoranjan Bharti- When will you reply to Modi on social media? digvijay singh− hamaara sangharsh kisi vyakti se nahin he
 Our fight is against ideology
 soshal media par jo sangh kii vichaardhaara he aaj mahatma gandhi ke murder ko jastiphai karti he
 Mahatma tells Gandhi's murder that healed
 kya iskaa ham log virodh naa karen
 Every citizen of the country, who is of the Liberal ideology, who is of the communal harmony ideology, we will continue to oppose the growing influence of the Sangh ideology on this social media
 manoranjan bharti− kaise karenge, aapke log to he nahin vahaan par
 Digvijay Singh - Our people are all over the country and gradually our penetration is increasing
 jo chah maheene pehle sangh kaa dabadabaa tha aaj wo nahin he or chah maheene baad dekhenge ki wo kahaan khadey hai
 Manoranjan Bharti- You might not have liked it when Rahul Gandhi was called Pappu
 digvijay singh− rahul gandhi ji ko kya−kya nahin kaha gaya, sonia ji ko kya nahin kaha gaya, kya ham usase vichlit ho jaaen humlog vichlit nahin hote
 Narendra Modi ji gets distracted
 aapako yaad he karan thapar ne jab unase kuch prashn puche to ve nikalakar baahar chale gaye
 Name any one Congress leader who has misbehaved
 ham saamana karnaa jaanate hai
 These Sangh people do not know
 manoranjan bharti− aapako lagata he ki ye soshal media belgaum ho saktaa he? Digvijay Singh - Freedom of thought exists in every democracy
 hamaare yahaan iske liye kanoon bana hua he or kanoon ke daayre main rahakar kaam karnaa chahie
 Manoranjan Bharti- You think that Shivraj Singh Chauhan is pointing out that Modi's supporters are not bjp's supporters
 digvijay singh− mujhe unke jhagade main nahin padana
 Recreation Bharti- Are you preparing for the election by assuming Rahul vs Modi? digvijay singh− modi hamaare liye koi mudda nahin hai
 Our fight is a battle of ideology
 hamaari ladaai unalogon se he jis vichaardhaara ne mahatma gandhi kii hatya karai thi jis vichaardhaara ne sampradayik sadbhaav ko bigaada jisane desh main alpsankhyak samudaay ko badnaam karne ke liye bam phode
 The Battle of Radical Ideology
 congress party aazaadee ke pehle se ladati ai he or aage bhi ladegi
 Manoranjan Bharti- You do not think that if you will counter Modi's point to point, then the truth is known immediately
 digvijay singh− desh ke rajyon ke jo indicaters hai chaahe human devlepment index ho chaahe par capita incum ho chaahe epadiai ho chaahe manuphaccharing sactor main investment ho chaahe implementation of anual yuj ho, ek bhi criteria main gujarat number van par nahin he
 If you look at the Human Development Index, Kerala is at number one where the Congress government is there
 par capita incum dekhenge to haryana number van par he jahaan congress kaa raaj he
 In the manufacturing sector and FDI, Maharashtra is at number one
 gujarat koun se stage par number van par he
 Maximum malnutrition is increasing there, the number of women is decreasing there
 jo growth rate he gujarat kaa wo hameshaa bharat ke growth rate se 2−4 zyada rahaa he
 Double digit growth has been in Gujarat even in the 90s
 iskaa shrey modi ko nahin jaataa he
 The credit goes to the industrialists of Gujarat
 manoranjan bharti− aapako lagata he ki industrialist chaahate hai ki modi piem bane? Digvijay Singh - to whom he has given crores of land for free, to whom he has given the benefit of thousands of crores in tax, if he does not praise them, then whom will he do
 manoranjan bharti−aap 2014 kaa chunaav ladenge? If Digvijay Singh-party gives the ticket then he will definitely fight
 manoranjan bharti− matlab aap taiyaar hai? Digvijay Singh - will fight anywhere from here
 manoranjan bharti− 2014 main upi main aapaki siton kii sankhya jas kii tas rahegi
 Digvijay Singh - It cannot be said, but the preparations are complete and will fight the elections firmly
 manoranjan bharti− kya priyanka chunaav ladegi?tippaniyan Digvijay Singh - i have no idea
 manoranjan bharti− party main ek hi power centre hona chahie? Digvijay Singh- i have said my point and i am following what the official spokesperson has said
 manoranjan bharti− kahin yah kuch zyada thurytical to nahin he? Digvijay Singh - Absolutely not
 siem yaa piem kaa bhaashan nahin tha
 Vice President of Congress Party was the speech
 desh kaa har vyakti yah jaananaa chahta tha ki aakhir rahul gandhi brands he kya? bhaashan main rahul gandhi brands hi usamen vyakt kiya gaya
 Manoranjan Bharti- When will your party connect with 14 crore people under social media? digvijay singh− fikki mahila wing kaa kyrkram tha
 Those who are union directors are not married
 ab ye bhi ek bahut bada prashn he ki ye shaadi−shuda hai yaa nahin
 In the form they fill in to contest elections, they also keep secret whether they are married or not
 pehali baat to yah he ki is desh kii janata or visheshkar mahila varg yah jaananaa chahta he ki modi ji aap ye spasht kar den ki aap shaadi−shuda hai yaa nahin
 The second thing is that they tell women that women should awaken the efforts of the people of the country
 yahi apane aap main sangh kii maansikta ko jaahir karata he
 We want to increase female power
 is desh main mahila shakti badhaane main kisi kaa yogadan rahaa he to congress kaa he
 Rajiv Gandhi gave reservation to women
 jitna bhi desh main mahilaon ke paksh main nirnay hue hai sabhi congress ke rajya sarkaron or centre sarkaar ne liya he
 BJP has done nothing
 main poochna chahta hum modi se ki 35 rajyon kii list main aapke rajya main mail−femail ke anupaat main 32wein number par he
 The number of women is decreasing with you
 iskaa matlab yahi he ki aapke yahaan kanya bhrun hatya kii ghatnaayen bad rahi hai iskaa uttar nahin dete hai or aap mahilaon se sangh prachaarak kii tarah bhaashan dete hai
 We would like Modi to give a lot of speeches so that the people of the country will know how long they will listen to the rhetorical speech, why they do not talk about Yashoda Ben's pizza
 unase puuchhie ki yashoda ben koun hai? Manoranjan Bharati - meaning he was playing with emotions in this gathering digvijay singh− sangh prachaarak kaa bhaashan isi prakaar rata−rataya hota he
 The people of the Sangh are trained in such a way that just look at the road like a horse of a horse and do not look around
 manoranjan bharti− kya modi ke bhaashan main sonia ji kii baat karnaa bul gaye? Digvijay Singh - If he wants to respect women, then accept Sushma Swaraj as the next Prime Minister
 manoranjan bharti− aap soshal media par modi ko kab jawaab denge? Digvijay Singh - Our struggle is not with any person
 hamaari ladaai vichaardhaara se he
 Today, the ideology of the Sangh on social media justifies Mahatma Gandhi's murder
 mahatma gandhi ke murder ko kahati he ki thik hua
 Should we not oppose it? desh kaa har naagarik jo libral vichaardhaara kaa he jo sampradayik sadbhaav vichaardhaara kaa he, is soshal media par jo sangh kii vichaardhaara kaa prabhaav badhata ja rahaa he uskaa ham nirantar virodh karenge
 Manoranjan Bharati - How will your people not be there? digvijay singh− hamaare log puure desh main hai or dhire−dhire hamaara jo penitrishan he bad rahaa he
 What was dominating the Sangh six months ago is no more today and after six months will see where they stand
 manoranjan bharti− aapako acha nahin laga hoga jab rahul gandhi ko pappu kaha gaya hoga
 Digvijay Singh- What was not told to Rahul Gandhiji, what was not told to Soniaji, should we get distracted by that, we do not get distracted
 narendra modi ji vichlit ho jate hai
 Do you remember when Karan Thapar asked him some questions, he went out
 kisi bhi ek congress netaa kaa naam bataaen jisane badasluki kii ho
 We know how to cope
 ye sangh ke log nahin jaanate
 Manoranjan Bharati- Do you think this social media can be unbridled? digvijay singh− vichaaron kii azaadi har prajatantr main hoti he
 We have a law for this and we should work within the scope of the law
 manoranjan bharti− aapako lagata he ki shivaraj singh chouhan yah ishaara kar rahe hai ki modi ke samarthak bijepi ke samarthak nahin hai
 Digvijay Singh - i do not get into a fight with him
 manoranjan bharti− rahul banaam modi ko maanakar aap chunaav kii taiyaari kar rahe hai? Digvijay Singh- Modi is not an issue for us
 hamaari ladaai vichaardhaara kii ladaai he
 Our fight is against the people who killed Mahatma Gandhi, the ideology that ruined the communal harmony, which exploded bombs to discredit the minority community in the country
 kattarpanthi vichaardhaara kii ladaai
 The Congress party has been fighting since independence and will fight even further
 manoranjan bharti− aapako nahin lagata ki agar aap modi kii baton ko point tu point counter karenge to turant sachai pataa chalata he
 Digvijay Singh - Indicators of the states of the country, whether it is a Human Development Index, whether it is Capita Income, FDI, Investment in Manufacturing Sector or Implementation of Annual Use, Gujarat is not number one in any criterion

 Manoranjan bharati-party should have only one power center? digvijay singh− main apni baat kah chukaa hum or oficial spoxperson ne jo baat kahi he main uskaa paalan kar rahaa hum
 Digvijay Singh - FICCI was the women's wing program
 sangh sanchaalak jo hote hai wo shaadi−shuda nahin hote hai
 Now this is also a very big question whether they are married or not
 ye chunaav ladane ke liye jo form bharte hai, usamen bhi gupt rakhte hai ki ye shaadi−shuda hai yaa nahin
 The first thing is that the people of this country and especially the women class want to know that Modi ji should make it clear whether you are married or not
 duusari baat yah he ki wo mahilaon ko kehete hai ki mahilaayein desh kaa ham logon kaa purusharth jaagrit karen
 This itself shows the Sangh's mindset
 ham mahila shakti ko badhanaa chaahate hai
 If anyone has contributed to increase women's power in this country, then it is the Congress
 rajeev gandhi ne mahilaon ko aarakshan diya
 As much as decisions have been taken in favor of women in the country, all Congress state governments and the central government have taken it
 bhaajapa ne kuch nahin kiya he
 i want to ask Modi that in the list of 35 states, your state is at number 32 in the ratio of male-female
 aap ke yahaan mahilaon kii sankhya ghat rahi he
 This means that the incidence of female feticide is increasing in your home and you do not answer it and you give speeches to women like Sangh Pracharak
 ham to chahenge ki modi khub bhaashan den taaki desh kii janata ko maaloom to pade ki rata−rataya bhaashan kitna din sunenge wo yashoda ben ke pizza kii baat kyon nahin karte
 Ask them who is Yashoda Ben? manoranjan bharti− matlab wo is sabha main bhaawanaaon se khel rahe the The speech of Digvijay singh-sangh Pracharak is like this
 sangh ke logon kii training is prakaar hoti he ki taange ke ghode kii tarah sirf sadak par dekho or aas−paas mat dekho
 Manoranjan Bharti - Did Modi's speech speak of Soniaji in Modi's speech? digvijay singh− agar wo mahilaon kii izzat karnaa chaahate hai to sushamaa swaraj ko agle pradhanmantri ke rup main sweekaar kar len
 Manoranjan Bharti- When will you reply to Modi on social media? digvijay singh− hamaara sangharsh kisi vyakti se nahin he
 Our fight is against ideology

 The people of the Sangh are trained in such a way that just look at the road like a horse of a horse and do not look around
 manoranjan bharti− kya modi ke bhaashan main sonia ji kii baat karnaa bul gaye? Digvijay Singh - If he wants to respect women, then accept Sushma Swaraj as the next Prime Minister
 manoranjan bharti− aap soshal media par modi ko kab jawaab denge? Digvijay Singh - Our struggle is not with any person
 hamaari ladaai vichaardhaara se he
 Today, the ideology of the Sangh on social media justifies Mahatma Gandhi's murder
 mahatma gandhi ke murder ko kahati he ki thik hua
 Should we not oppose it? desh kaa har naagarik jo libral vichaardhaara kaa he jo sampradayik sadbhaav vichaardhaara kaa he, is soshal media par jo sangh kii vichaardhaara kaa prabhaav badhata ja rahaa he uskaa ham nirantar virodh karenge
 Manoranjan Bharati - How will your people not be there? digvijay singh− hamaare log puure desh main hai or dhire−dhire hamaara jo penitrishan he bad rahaa he
 What was dominating the Sangh six months ago is no more today and after six months will see where they stand
 manoranjan bharti− aapako acha nahin laga hoga jab rahul gandhi ko pappu kaha gaya hoga
 Digvijay Singh- What was not told to Rahul Gandhiji, what was not told to Soniaji, should we get distracted by that, we do not get distracted
 narendra modi ji vichlit ho jate hai
 Do you remember when Karan Thapar asked him some questions, he went out
 kisi bhi ek congress netaa kaa naam bataaen jisane badasluki kii ho
 We know how to cope
 ye sangh ke log nahin jaanate
 Manoranjan Bharati- Do you think this social media can be unbridled? digvijay singh− vichaaron kii azaadi har prajatantr main hoti he
 We have a law for this and we should work within the scope of the law
 manoranjan bharti− aapako lagata he ki shivaraj singh chouhan yah ishaara kar rahe hai ki modi ke samarthak bijepi ke samarthak nahin hai
 Digvijay Singh - i do not get into a fight with him
 manoranjan bharti− rahul banaam modi ko maanakar aap chunaav kii taiyaari kar rahe hai? Digvijay Singh- Modi is not an issue for us
 hamaari ladaai vichaardhaara kii ladaai he
 Our fight is against the people who killed Mahatma Gandhi, the ideology that ruined the communal harmony, which exploded bombs to discredit the minority community in the country
 kattarpanthi vichaardhaara kii ladaai
 The Congress party has been fighting since independence and will fight even further
 manoranjan bharti− aapako nahin lagata ki agar aap modi kii baton ko point tu point counter karenge to turant sachai pataa chalata he
 Digvijay Singh - Indicators of the states of the country, whether it is a Human Development Index, whether it is Capita Income, FDI, Investment in Manufacturing Sector or Implementation of Annual Use, Gujarat is not number one in any criterion
 agar aap human devlepment index dekhenge to kerala number van par he jahaan congress kii sarkaar he
 But if we look at the capita income, Haryana is at number one where the Congress is ruling
 manuphaccharing sactor or epadiai main dekhenge to maharashtra number van par he
 Gujarat is number one on which stage
 sabase zyada kuposhan vahiin bad rahaa he, sabase zyada mahilaon kii sankhya vahiin ghat rahi he
 Gujarat's growth rate has always been 2–4 more than India's growth rate
 dabl disit growth to gujarat main 90 ke dashak main bhi rahaa he
 The credit does not go to Modi
 iskaa shrey gujarat ke udyogpatiyon ko jaataa he
 Manoranjan Bharati- Do you think that industrialists want Modi to become PM? digvijay singh− jinako unhonen muft main karodon kii zamin di hai, jinako unhone tex main hazaron karod kaa faaydaa diya he wo unka gungan nahin karenge to kiskaa karenge
 Manoranjan Bharti – will you contest the 2014 election? digvijay singh−party tikat degi to jarur ladenge

 Our fight is against ideology
 soshal media par jo sangh kii vichaardhaara he aaj mahatma gandhi ke murder ko jastiphai karti he
 Mahatma tells Gandhi's murder that healed

 Every citizen of the country, who is of the Liberal ideology, who is of the communal harmony ideology, we will continue to oppose the growing influence of the Sangh ideology on this social media

 ) aagaamee loksabhaa chunaav se pehle bihar main mahagathbandhan kaa swaroop tay ho gaya he
 Whereas in terms of seats, an alliance is being said in two big opposition parties Samajwadi Party (SP) and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) in Uttar Pradesh, the largest state of the Hindi belt
 upi main pichley dinon hue loksabhaa or vidhansabha upachunaav main espi-bispi gathbandhan ko mili apratyaashit safalataa ko dekhte hue yah tay mana ja rahaa he ki donon siyaasi dal aam chunaav saath ladenge
 But it is also to be noted here that BSP usually does not contest by-elections
 lihaaja, upachunaav main bispi ke liye gathbandhan badi baat nahin thi
 After the recently concluded assembly elections in five states, all political parties have started preparing for the upcoming Lok Sabha elections
 lekin sabaki nigahen uttar pradesh main tiki hai jahaan ek- duusare ke dhur virdohi dal espi or bispi ke ek saath chunaav ladane kii taiyaari main hai
 However, this will not be so easy as BSP supremo Mayawati is considered very tough in terms of bargaining
 philhal, bispi ke loksabhaa main ek bhi saansad nahin hai
 While the SP has 7 mps including the recently held Gorakhpur and Phulpur Lok Sabha by-elections
 34 siton par duusare sthaan par rahi thi bispi, 31 par esapiam taur par gathbandhan ko lekar jo formula tay hota he usamen jis seat par jiskaa kabja hota he wo to usee ko milti he
 Then it is seen that in the last election, on which seat the candidate of that political party was second
 is lihaaj se yadi 2014 ke aam chunaavon ko aadhaar par banaaya jaae to bispi 34 siton par duusare sthaan par thi or samaajawaadee party 31 siton par duusare sthaan par thi
 At the same time, the remaining seats in 80 Lok Sabha seats can be divided on the basis of vote percentage
 lekin espi-bispi gathbandhan main asal pech muslim bahul siton par funs saktaa he
 Maya gave 100 Muslims a ticket to the Legislative Assembly, the Samajwadi Party, which considers the yadav-muslim equation as its base, would not want to lose its minority base
 vahiin, bahujan samaaj party lagaataar alpsankhyakon ko apane kheme main laane kaa prayaas karti rahi he
 For this purpose, in the 2017 assembly elections held in the year 2017, the BSP gave tickets to Muslim candidates in 100 seats
 jabaki espi, congress ke saath gathbandhan main chunaav ladi thi
 In such a situation, the votes of SP and BSP candidates got scattered, which benefited BJP
 ye hai khaas muslim bahul sitenmuslim aabaadi ke lihaaj se rampur, muradabad, saharanpur, bijanour or amroha aisi loksabhaa siten hai jahaan muslim aabaadi 35 se 50 fisadi ke bich he
 In Meerut, Kairana, Bareilly, Muzaffarnagar, Sambhal, Dumriaganj, Bahraich, Kaiserganj, Lucknow, Shahjahanpur and Barabanki the Muslim population is more than 20 percent and less than 35 percent
 haal ke dinon main bahujan samaaj party ne pashchim uttar pradesh main apana alpsankhyak aadhaar badhaayaa he
 So, these are the seats that can get screwed up
 iske baad baat un siton kii aegi, jahaan espi or bispi donon hi duusare sthaan par nahin raheen
 In such a situation, the caste equations will matter and the seats on which castes will have heavy seats will get seats
 lekin madhya pradesh, rajasthan or chhattisgarh ke vidhansabha ke anubhav ko dekha jaae to mahaj kuch siton kii oonch- neech par bispi supremeo mayawati ne congress ke saath gathbandhan na karne kaa ekatarfa faisla le liya tha

 An important session of the India Today Conclave was attended by Yuval Noh Harari, author of 'sapiens: a Brief History of Human Kind'
 itihaaskaar haraari ne apane bhaashan ke dauraan vaishvikaran or itihaas par baat kii
 During this, he said in response to a question that there are two types of God in the world
 ek wo jinke bare main ham kuch bhi nahin jaanate or duusare wo jinke bare main hamen sab kuch pataa he
 Actually, Harari was asked the question if you believe in God, then he said that i do not believe in God
 saath hi unhone apni pehali baat ko bich main rokte hue bataaya ki duniya main do prakaar ke bhagwaan hai
 One who is invisible, about whom we know nothing, which is mysterious
 jab kabhi logon ko kisi sawaal kaa jawaab nahin miltaa to log isi bhagwaan ko yaad karte hai or kehete hai ki ye bhagwaan ne kiya yaa banaaya hoga
 This God was never seen nor heard of
 main isi bhagwaan ko maanata hum
 At the same time, the second type of God is the exact opposite of which we all know everything
 unke bare main hamen ye pataa he ki unhone mahilaon ke fishan ke liye kya kiya he, human sexuality ke liye kya kiya
 These are the Gods who tell us which leader we have to vote for
 jinhen jaadu aata he, jo ye kehete hai ki ek vyakti do mahilaon ke saath sambandh bana saktaa he
 The author Harari states that these are extremely dangerous types of God
 jinhen main nahin maanata
 He castigated the second type of God, saying that if there is an invisible force that created this universe, created the world, created man, is responsible for the black hole, which gave beautiful life
 use shaayad hi is baat se matlab hoga ki mahilaon kaa dress code kya hona chahie
 'nationalism came for the first time four to five thousand years ago', Harhari said that the future will be very different from the present and global problems will require solutions
 rashtrawaad ke itihaas ke bare main bataate hue haraari ne kaha ki 4,000-5,000 saal pehle rashtrawaad pehali baar nadi ke tatavarti ilaakon main aayaa
 At that time small groups worked together to avoid the outbreak of rivers and nature
 un logon ne ek saath milakar naharon or baandhon kaa nirmaan kiya
 Together, grow grains
 unhone kaha ki haal ke dinon main jis prakaar ke rashtrawaad kii vaapasi hui he wo chintaa kaa vishay he or ye duniya ke kisi doordaraj ke kone main nahin balki uttari america, europe or bharat main he
 This is a concern because nationalism will not be able to provide solutions which the world will face in future
 ramayana par bole haraari- ek tathy ke sach hone se puri kahani ko sahi nahin mana ja sakatajab lekhak haraari se poocha gaya ki kya aapke yahaan bhi bharat kii tarah itihaas se chhedchhad or use lekar vivaad hota he? iske jawaab main unhone kaha ki itihaas se chhedchhad bharat hi nahin balki ek global samasya he
 He said that history is a legend
 haraari ne kaha ki main ye nahin kahata ki sabhi dharmik kitaaben sahi hai, iske liye hamen katha or sachai main fark karnaa hoga
 On the question of the truth of Ramayana, he said that if you have evidence, then i have to believe him
 vahiin, agar aapke paas kisi ghatana ko lekar koi saboot nahin hai to main us par vishwaas nahin kar saktaa
 On this, he was asked that Google has shown the picture of Ram Setu located between India and Sri Lanka, then whether the story of Ramayana is true
 iske jawaab main unhone kaha ki kisi kahani ke ek pahalu ke sach hone se puri kahani sach nahin sakati
 Technological destruction biggest challengeharhari while talking about the challenges facing the world said that in today's time the biggest challenge facing the world is technical destruction
 saath hi unhone kaha ki aaj lakhon karodon kii sankhya main aise log majood hai jinaki iconomic vailu jiro he jo ki duniya ke liye bada kharatnaak he
 However, now governments are making schemes, which are providing employment to the people
 lekin rojgaar ke badale milane vaale vetan ko lekar bhi duniya main bahut sari visangatiyaan maujuud hai
 He said that most of the world depends on cheap wages
 jo ki kabhi bhi nasht ho sakati he, bikhar sakati he
 To understand this, you can compare the wages received in Bangladesh and the US to the wages
 darasal, abhi ke samay main kahin to bahut kam or kahin behad zyada mazdooree milti he
 Due to this, weak and poor countries are becoming poorer and richer and richer
 vaishvik raajnneeti par bolte hue haraari ne kaha ki duniya main niyam bhi global hone chahie
 He tried to explain by giving examples and said that in today's time, if the US prohibits the making of weapons or stops making weapons, then other countries like Russia and China increase the production of that weapon
 yah america bhi apane faisle ko palatney par majaboor ho jaataa he or vinaashak hathiyaaron kaa utpaadan shuru kar detaa he
 In such an environment, no country prepares those countries to agree to this rule, which will benefit the world
 deshon ko nahin pataa ki duniya ke saamne samasya kya heharaari ne kaha ki ham 21veen sadi main ji rahe hai, lekin abhi bhi rashtron ko ye pataa nahin he ki unke samaksh badi samasya kya he
 He said that global politics is necessary to understand the problems
 haraari ne kaha ki 1945 ke baad ek badlaav hua, wo ye ki kisi bhi do bade deshon ke bich yuddh nahin hua
 But to understand the global problem, we have to think above the nation and religion
 thik usee prakaar jaise ham dharmik muddon par hone vaale vivaadon ke baad unke har pahalu par gaharaai se adhyayan karte hai or sawaal jawaab karte hai
 Harari said that there are no more wars
 logon kii soch main hue vaishvik parivartan or unke faislon se ye badlaav aayaa he
 Greater global change requires intelligence at the global level
 agar ham skulon main maanav jati ke bare main padhaanaa shuru karen or samasyaon par baat karen to bachche us par dhyaan kendrit karenge or us tak pahunch sakenge

 Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi on Sunday praised China and South Korea for their use of organizing the Olympic Games to improve the image of their country, while on the other hand India has shared the Commonwealth
 This missed an excellent opportunity due to upsets and scandals in organizing the Games
 modi ne kaha ki desh ko ek urjavan shakti ke rup main pesh karnaa aaj sainik yaa aarthik takat ke taur par pesh karne se adhik mahatvapurn he
 Addressing a large public meeting in North Delhi, Modi said, South Korea hosted the Olympic Games and showed what they are

 China did the same

 yah puraskaar amitabh bachchan, harivansh raay bachchan, abhishek bachchan, jaya bachchan, aishwarya raay bachchan, shubha mudgal, rekha bharadwaj, reeta ganguli, kailash kher, arunima sinha, navazuddin sidghiki, nasiruddin shah, ravindra jain, bhubaneshwar kumaar jaisi hastiyon ko mil chukaa he
 The comments mywati ne apni sarkaar aane par yah puraskaar band kar die the
 But in 2012, Akhilesh Yadav government restarted it
 is baar is puraskaar ko lekar tamaam sawaal uthe or ilzaam lage ki akhilesh yadav ne tamaam garib logon ko aarthik madad karne ke liye yash bharti puraskaar de diya
 The extent was reached when Akhilesh Yadav in the auditorium of the Chief Minister's new office, Lok Bhawan, announced the award of Yash Bharti from the stage to the woman who was conducting the award ceremony
 yahi nahin samaajawaadee party daftar main kaam karne vaale un do karmchaariyon ko patrakarita kii shrenee main upi kaa sabase bada puraskaar de diya gaya, jinka patrakarita se koi vaasta nahin he

 If the investigation found that the awardees were not entitled to it, then the honor may not be returned now, but the pension of Rs 50,000 per month received by them may be discontinued

 Mayawati stopped the awards when she came to her government
 lekin 2012 main akhilesh yadav sarkaar ne ise dobaaraa shuru karvaa diya
 This time many questions were raised about this award and it was alleged that Akhilesh Yadav gave the Yash Bharti Award for financial help to all the poor people
 had to tab ho gayi jab mukhyamantri ke nae daftar lok bhawan ke sabhaagaar main akhilesh yadav ne puraskaar samaaroh kaa sanchaalan karne vaali mahila ko bhi khush hokar vahiin manch se yash bharti puraskaar dene kaa elaan kar diya
 Not only this, those two employees working in the Samajwadi Party office were given the biggest prize of UP in the journalism category, which has nothing to do with journalism
 akhilesh ke is faisle par bhi sawaal uthe
 Yogi has said that the dignity of this honor should not be reduced by awarding the wrong people
 agar jaanch main paaya gaya ki puraskaar paane vaale iske haqadaar nahin the to sammaan to ab waapas nahin ho saktaa lekin unako taumr milane vaali 50 hazaar rupee maheenaa pension band ho sakati he
 Although the Amitabh Bachchan family has received this award, but they do not take its pension
 yahi nahin samaajawaadee party daftar main kaam karne vaale un do karmchaariyon ko patrakarita kii shrenee main upi kaa sabase bada puraskaar de diya gaya, jinka patrakarita se koi vaasta nahin he

 bhartiya rigerv bank 1 april se base rate ko MCLR se link karne kii taiyaari kar rahaa he
 The RBI has taken this decision after complaints that banks were not giving benefit of interest rate cuts to customers
 bhartiya rigerv bank ne pichley saal 1 april, 2016 ko marginal cost of funds besd lending rates (MCLR) kii vyavastha shuru kii thi
 For this, he had asked banks to move from base rate to MCLR, but banks did not show much interest in it
 iske baad hi arabiai ne base rate ko emsielaar se jodne kaa faisla kiya he
 What is the Base Rate? The Base Rate is decided by the Reserve Bank of India
 yah vah rate hota he, jiske neeche koi bhi bank apane graahak ko lone nahin de saktaa he
 This system was introduced so as to bring transparency in the credit market
 kya he khami?zyaadaatar bank base rate ke tahat hi apane graahakon ko bank lone muhaiyaa karte hai
 The drawback of this arrangement was that banks do not change interest rates quickly
 kendriya bank kii taraf se byaaj daron main katautee kiye jane ke baad bhi bank iskaa phayda twarit graahakon ko nahin dete
 The benefit of the cut in interest rates gradually reaches the customers
 isse iskaa puraa phayda graahakon ko nahin mil paata he
 What is MCLR rate? The Reserve Bank of India has introduced the system of Marginal Cost of Funds Based Lending Rates (MCLR) on April 1 last year
 is vyavastha ke tahat alag-alag graahak ke liye lone kii byaaj daren uski risk profile ke aadhaar par tay kii jaati hai
 How is the MCLR rate determined? Marginal means separate or additional
 jab bhi bank lending rate tay karte hai, to vah badali hui sthiti kaa kharch or marginal cost ko bhi calculate karte hai
 The level of banks includes the interest rate paid on deposits to customers
 MCLR ko tay karne ke liye 4 factor ko dhyaan main rakhaa jaataa he
 In this - additional charge of the fund - Negative carry on CRR - Operation cost - Tener premium, you will have the advantage of joining the MCLR of the base rate, that whenever the interest rates will be cut by the RBI, it will immediately benefit the customers
 It will be easy to deliver
 isse aapaki iemai main byaaj daron main hone vaali katautee kaa phayda jald mil sakegaa
 What is Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) Cash reserve ratio is the ratio on which banks have to keep some money deposited with RBI
 aap par aise padataa he asarajab bhi cash rigerv reshio badhata he, to bank kam lone dete hai
 In fact, with increasing CRR, they have to keep more money in reserve with RBI
 isse bank kam karj dete hai or vah lending rates badha dete hai
 At the same time, whenever CRR is cut, there is pressure on banks to give more loans

 shivasena ne apana mukh patr saamana main likhaa he ki kuch log nae vidhayakon se sampark kar 'thili' kii bhashaa bol rahe hai or aisi shikaayatein bad rahi he
 The Shiv Sena has said that the previous power is being used to distribute 'bags' for the next power

 he
 The death of the civilian also led to tension and stonewalling of the security forces
 pulavama hamale kaa badla lene or pinglina jaisi sthitiyon se nipatane ke liye raksha visheshgy jidi bakshi ne ajtak se kaha he ki patharbaajon ko aatanki samajhakar unpar karrwai kii jaae
 "we fully expected that the security forces would find Ghazi Rashid, who is believed to be the mastermind of the Pulwama attack," he said
 yah afsos kii baat he ki gaji nae ladakon ko bhartee kar rahaa he
 There is a lot of enthusiasm among our soldiers at this time, if we kill Ghazi, it will be the best news for us at this time
 jidi bakshi ne kaha ki jammu-kashmir main 250 aatankiyon se jitna khatra he usase kam vahaan ke 40 hajaar patharbaajon se bhi nahin he
 These stonemasons will have to deal like terrorists
 unke upar sakht ection lene kii jarurat he
 This will have to be done only once or twice, after that it will not be needed

 Otherwise they do not need to live in Kashmir

 Strict steps should be taken for this
 suraksha balon ke haath baandhakar unhen ladane ke liye nahin kaha ja saktaa
 Security forces have shown considerable tolerance
 iskaa koi phayda nahin hua
 This nonsense has to be stopped
 pathar maarane waalon ke saath kya karnaa he, yah sochna hoga
 There are many ways to deal with them, but it has to be implemented
 ise babugiri main nahin fansaana chahie
 The drawback is that after an accident like Pulwama, it is not being dealt with by focusing on it
 halaat bad se badtar hote ja rahe hai
 One has to show firmness to deal with this problem

 ek dawaai kii bottle kaa udhaaharan len, jisaki expyri date nikal chuki he lekin uski ab life nahin he
 Don't be like that bottle
 aapke aas-paas kai chizein bahut dinon se ho rahi hoti hai bas kai baar bahut der se nazar jaati he
 The same thing happened to me when attracted to the variety of sarees as soon as i entered the Hyderabad airport, i went to the Chennai saree store
 kanjivaram or tasar kii baarikiyon se guzar hi rahaa tha tabhi nazar padi rajesh par
 Busy in selling the sari to a customer from Bhagalpur in a suit-boot, Rajesh tied the sari so quickly that within a few shocks, her beauty sparkled far more than being overturned on the table
 rajesh kii baayin haath par pallu laharaate hi pataa chalaa ki sari kaa koun sa hissaa kahaan or kaise dikhegaa
 i was going through my dislike between sarees on the other table when i looked at Rajesh
 saadiyon ko vahiin choda or bag se phone nikaal kar tasviir lene kii ijazat maangi
 If the lady who was showing me the sari also wanted it, she could remove my doubts by tying the saris like Rajesh, but she missed it
 bas itnaa zarur kiya ki meri tasviir ke liye rajesh se puch liya
 Rajesh also gave his consent with a light smile
 bechney kaa yah tarika or salika donon mujhe behad pasand aa gaya
 It is another matter that i also liked Rajesh sari but Bhagalpur buyer did not change his mind
 fasebuk par post karne se pehle main rajesh kii tasviir ko gaur se dekhne laga
 The elegance with which the sari's pallu was waved is a perfect example of the dedication of a better salesman
 us kshan ke liye rajesh ne sirf sari hi nahin pahani balki sari kii khoobasarati ko ubhaarne ke liye usamen dhal gaye
 The responses that came after posting on your Facebook thought that you should write this account for the readers
 zyaadaatar logon ne rajesh kii apane kaam ke prati eemaandaaree ko saraahaa he or celut bhi kiya he
 Many people have also said that men are selling saris like this, now you know
 kuch logon ko der se na pataa chale to duniya main likhane or chhapane ke saath hi kahaniyon kaa ant ho jaae
 So i was not surprised to find out late
 lekin teen hazaar se zyaada likes, dedh sau se zyaada coment or pachaas se zyada share ne meri dilchaspiyon ko or kured diya
 After all, what is it in this picture that both knowing and not knowing were filled with pleasant feeling
 tippaniyan While reading those comments, i started to know that now everywhere men are tied in saris and they tell what will look like
 devashish ne likhaa he ki patna market kii dukaanon main bhi aise log mil jaaenge or amit tiwari ne likhaa he ki hyderabad ke amirpet main mardon ko rajesh kii tarah bechate dekha he
 Priyadarshini has written that come to Ahmednagar in Maharashtra
 yahaan har sari celsman khud hi pahanakar bataata he
 Vanamrita has written that every shop looks welcoming in the same way when you go to buy saris in Chandni Chowk
 inke andaaz par hansi bhi aati he or apane kaam ko puure man se karne kaa jazbaa bhi dikhaai detaa he
 It is a business strategy like Sales Talk which is not taught in business schools
 vanamrata ke jawaab se mere is sawaal kaa puraa jawaab nahin mila ki ek mahila kisi purush ko sari baandhte dekh kya sochati hogi
 Must think about it or just about saree! Well Deepak has sent a picture of Lajpat Nagar in Delhi on my Facebook page
 tasviir satyapit to nahin kar saktaa lekin andaaza to ho hi jaataa he
 There must be a sari competition, who can tie better, man or woman isiilie kaha ki hamaare aasapaas kii duniya badal gai he
 That's why most people are praising Rajesh
 main ek do tippaniyon se sahamat nahin hum ki rajesh ke ghar yaa doston ko pataa chalegaa to use sharmindagi hogi
 How long would men like Rajesh throw off this mentality, or else the world of male salesmen who used to wear saris from Banaras to Patna and Ahmednagar would not have expanded
 vaise sari banati bhi he mardon ke haath se
 Perhaps the world of saris has also changed
 pinki pandey ne likhaa he ki pehle saadiyon ke siron kii pahchaan palle ke alag dizin se hoti thi, ab in bahurangi batorua saadiyon ke fishan main kidar khonsnaa he or kidar kaa khonsnaa he or kidar kaa pallaa lenaa he aise hi samajhnaa or samajhaana padegaa
 If this is the case then what would have happened in Rajeshji's house
 sari kaise pahani gai he iskaa antim faisla koun karata hoga
 Rajesh or Rajesh's wife! Well, men can wear saris, right! main duusari mez par saadiyon ke bich apni naapsandgi se guzar rahaa tha tabhi meri nazar rajesh par padi
 Left the saris there and took out the phone from the bag and asked for permission to take the picture
 jo mahila mujhe sari dikhaa rahi thim wo bhi chaahatin to rajesh kii tarah saadiyon ko baandhakar meri shankaaon ko dur kar sakati thim, lekin wo chook gayi
 Just made sure to ask Rajesh for my picture
 rajesh ne bhi ek halki muskuraahat ke saath apni sahmati de di
 i liked both this method of selling and Salika
 ye or baat he ki rajesh vaali sari mujhe bhi pasand aa gai lekin bhagalpur vaale karidaar ne apana iraadaa nahin badla
 Before posting on Facebook, i started looking at Rajesh's picture carefully
 jis lavanya yani nazaakat se sari kaa pallu laharaaya tha wo ek behatar celsman kii kartavyanishtha kaa uttam udhaaharan he
 For that moment, Rajesh not only wore a sari but also got into it to highlight the beauty of the sari
 apane fasebuk par post karne ke baad jo pratikriyaayein ain unase laga ki aap pathakon ke liye is vrutant ko likhnaa chahie
 Most of the people have appreciated Rajesh's honesty about his work and also saluted him
 kai logon ne yah bhi kaha he ki purush to sari aise hi bech rahe hai, aapako ab pataa chalaa he
 If some people do not know late, then the stories will end with writing and printing in the world
 isliye mujhe der se pataa chalane par khaas hairaani nahin hui
 But more than three thousand likes, more than one hundred and fifty comments and more than fifty shares further added to my interests
 aakhir is tasviir main aisa kya he ki jaanane or nahin jaanane vaale donon hi sukhad ahsaas se bhar gaye
 The comments main un tippaniyon ko padhate hue yah jaanane laga ki ab to har jagah mard hi sari baandh kar bataate hai ki kis sari kii kya luk hoga
 Devashish has written that such people will also be found in the shops of Patna market and Amit Tiwari has written that men have been seen selling Rajesh like that in Hyderabad's Ameerpet
 priyadarshini ne likhaa he ki maharashtra ke ahmednagar aaiye
 Here every saree salesman wears it himself
 vanamrata ne likhaa he ki chandani chowk main saadiyaan kharidne jaaiye to har dukaan isi tarah se swaagat karti dikhaai detii he
 There is also a laugh at their style and the passion to do their work with all their heart is also seen
 ye cells taak jaisi bijness stratji he jo bijness skulon main nahin padhai jaati
 i did not get a complete answer to my question of what a woman would think when she saw a man tying a sari
 uske bare main sochati hogi yaa sirf sari ke bare main! vaise deepak ne mere fasebuk pej par dilli ke lajpat nagar kii ek tasviir bheji he
 Can't verify the picture but guess what happens
 ek sari pratiyogita to honi hi chahie ki koun behatar baandh saktaa he, mard yaa aurat That is why the world around us has changed
 isliye zyaadaatar log rajesh kii tarif kar rahe hai
 i do not agree with one of the two comments that Rajesh's house or friends would be embarrassed to know
 is maansikta ko rajesh jaise purushon ne kab tak utaar phenkaa hoga varna banaras se lekar patna or ahmednagar tak sari baandh kar uski kubsuurati nikhaarane vaale mard celsmanon kii duniya kaa vistaar nahin hua hota
 By the way, saris are also made with the hands of men
 shaayad saadiyon kaa bhi sansar badal gaya he
 Pinky Pandey has written that earlier the ends of the saris were identified by the different design of the pallet, now in the fashion of these multicolored pickup saris, where to laugh and where to laugh and where to go is to be understood
 agar ye baat he to rajesh ji ke ghar main kya hota hoga
 Who would have made the final decision on how the sari is worn
 rajesh yaa rajesh kii patni! vaise mard sari pahan sakate hai, hai na! While reading those comments, i started to know that now everywhere men are tied in saris and they tell what will look like
 devashish ne likhaa he ki patna market kii dukaanon main bhi aise log mil jaaenge or amit tiwari ne likhaa he ki hyderabad ke amirpet main mardon ko rajesh kii tarah bechate dekha he
 Priyadarshini has written that come to Ahmednagar in Maharashtra
 yahaan har sari celsman khud hi pahanakar bataata he

 That's why most people are praising Rajesh
 main ek do tippaniyon se sahamat nahin hum ki rajesh ke ghar yaa doston ko pataa chalegaa to use sharmindagi hogi
 How long would men like Rajesh throw off this mentality, or else the world of male salesmen who used to wear saris from Banaras to Patna and Ahmednagar would not have expanded
 vaise sari banati bhi he mardon ke haath se
 Perhaps the world of saris has also changed

 Poonam, recently you described yourself as 'very shy'
 iske thik baad mumbai main aapke saath ‘kuch’ ghatit hua
 This incident is not matching with your comment on yourself
 isi vajah se aapako yah khulaa khat likhane ko majaboor hua hum
 You have given such information about yourself, which today's young generation is already aware of
 yah kahana shaayad galat nahin hoga ki yakeenan aap to sharmili hai hi, sara kasoor hamaari nigahon kaa hi he
 i have to spend a few more words to say my point
 darasal, jin gharon kii deevaaron par thakur prasad yaa is tarah ke calendar tange hote hai, un tak aapaki khyaati kuch der se pahunchi
 We do not have access to the Kingfisher calendar, so we have heard only a few stories about it
 sach kya he, yah aapako hi pataa hoga
 However, your name became popular when you announced something just before the World Cup to encourage Team India
 aapane kaha ki agar team india world cap jeet legi, to aap neude hone ko taiyaar hai
 When the glittering World Cup came into the hands of Dhoni's men, everyone's eyes were looking for you
 
 
 ab kahaan hai punam pandey? khayr, jald hi logon kaa bhram tut gaya
 Then for the first time we were convinced that you are really very shy
 yah hamaari nigahon kaa hi kasoor tha ki team india ke liye bade se bada ‘tyaag’ karne kii aapaki bhaavana ko ham kuch or hi samaj baithe the
 Since then, you have brought hundreds of your photographs to your fans through Twitter and Facebook
 un sari tasveeron main ek baat kaaman hoti he
 Innocence is reflected in your face
 agar koi hathpurvak aapke chehre se neeche najar daalata bhi he, to use har baar maayusi hi haath lagati he
 His condition would be like that of a researcher who comes out to discover some new fact on the center (s) of Gravity, but each time he returns to his mouth with the well-known fact that the earth is round
 har photo yah bataati he ki aapane apni ek had to jarur tay kii he, taaki buree najar vaale bhi apni had main rah saken
 i would say that someone who is blushing, learn this from you
 apane banaae usulon par chalanaa koi aapse sikh le
 My guess is that if Bollywood's 'the Great Showman' were alive today, you would have disappointed them because of your shyness
 agar aap 80 ke dashak kii heroin hotin or us daur kii abhinetriyaan aapke prabhaav main aa gai hotin, to ‘ram teri ganga maili’ or ‘satyam sivam sundaram’ jaisi kai filmein box offis par pani maangati najar aatin
 There is a lot of darkness in today's era
 koi parde par beparda ho rahi he, to koi kisi megsine ke liye apane cover utaar rahi he
 In such a situation, your shyness is liked by everyone
 ekaadh request ke saath chitthee samaapt kar rahaa hum
 First of all, take the news of that impatient photographer, who cannot wait till you are dressed in your full clothes
 khate-pite,baithte-letate, nahaate-dhote, vakt-bevakt aapaki tasviir khinchataa rahata he
 On the footpaths of our area, in the Noida atta market of Noida, one, two or sometimes three picks are easily available without bargaining for just Rs 100
 agar zyada takalif na ho, to ise mangava lijie or puure saal main ekaadh photo ‘sahi jagah par’ dupatta daalkar bhi khinchvaa lijie
 According to your name, you will look beautiful like Poonam's moon
 gustaakhee maaf kiijie or ab aage se khud ko ‘bahut sharmili’ bataakar hamen or sharminda mat kiijie

 Prithvi (eight), who made an impressive debut in Test cricket against West Indies, hit his first two balls for fours, but the third ball from the excellent length made this young batsman bold
 saini ne iske baad rahane (10) ko elbeadblyoo out kiya jabaki suryakumar yadav (chaar) ko duusari slip main kaich karaayaa
 Mumbai had high hopes from captain Shreyas Iyer who scored an unbeaten half-century in the semi-finals
 ayyar jeevandaan bhi mila lekin unhone baahar jaati gendon se chhedchhad jari rakhi or keval saat ran banaakar wicketiper unmukt chand ko kaich de baithe

 The issue of Jammu and Kashmir has created a stir in the country as well as abroad
 sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishadki baithak main bharat kii taraf se yah saaf kar diya gaya he ki kashmir (kashmir) kaa masalaa bharat kaa aantarik maamla he
 Despite this, Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan has tweeted that India's attitude towards Jammu and Kashmir is 'hangman'
 haalanki imran khan ke is twit kaa jawaab bollywood actor kamaal aar khan (kamaal r Khan) ne bakhubi diya he
 Kamal r Khan (kamaal r Khan) has tweeted saying that the style of Imran Khan is 'hypocritical' and advised the people of pok (pakistan Occupied Kashmir) to give freedom
 Sir @imrankhanpti if Kashmiri liberation should win and Kashmir should get independence
 Then at least you should give independence to ppl of POK immediately
 You are giving lecture to others but urself not doing same thing
 It's a hypocrisy sir
 https: / / t
 co / ds5fk5xs9v Bollywood actor Kamal r Khan, while targeting Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan, wrote, "sir, if Kashmiri liberation should win and Kashmir should get independence
" to kam se kam aapako pioke ke logon ko turant aazaadee dene chahie
 You are giving knowledge to others, but you are not doing so at all
 yah ek paakhandee ravaiya he
 "the fascist, Hindu Supremacist Modi Govt should know that while armies, militants & terrorists can be defeated by superior forces; history tells us that when a nation unites in a freedom struggle & does not fear death, no force can stop it from achieving its goal
 That is why the Hindutva exclusivist creed of the Modi-led Govt with its fascist tactics in IOK will fail miserably in its attempt to smother the Kashmiri liberation struggle
 Explain that Imran Khan tweeted while targeting the Indian government and raising the issue of Kashmir
 is twit main unhone likhaa, "fonsiwadi, hindu supremeo modi sarkaar ko pataa hona chahie ki senaaon or aatankwaadiyon ko behatar takaton dwaara haraaya ja saktaa he
 History is witness that when a nation is united in the freedom struggle and does not have the fear of death, no power can stop it from achieving its goal
 yahi kaaran he ki hindutv vaali modi sarkaar kaa yah ravaiya kashmiri mukti sangharsh ko dabaane main fail ho jayega
 " dilli main ek model ne jaharila padaarth khaakarkhudakushikarne kii koshish kii
 The model is admitted to the hospital
 uske ghar se ek patr bhi mila he, isamen usne apane mangetar sivam sharma par aarope lagaaya ki usne shaadi se inkaar kar diya, jiske kaaran usne khudakushi kaa prayaas kiya
 Not only this, the model said in a statement to the police that fiancé Neshadi had also raped her
 bayaan ke baad police ne sivam ke khilaaf dushkarm kaa maamla darj kar liya he
 According to the Ayodhya Nagar Police, Shobha (name changed), who lives in Indrapuri, was involved in modeling and event management
 event ke dauraan uski mulaakaat vidisha main rahane vaale sivam se hui thi
 Shobha's father says that her daughter and Shivam had a relationship in June and the engagement took place
 dainik bhaskar main chhapi khabar ke mutabik shobhaa ke pita kaa aarope he ki sivam ke pita suresh sharma ne dahej main 10 lakh rupee kii maang kii, jab itani rakam dene se inkaar kiya gaya to sharma ne rishta tod diya, lekin sivam ne pita ke khilaaf jaakar shaadi kaa aashwaasan diya
 Shobha alleges that her fiancée kept her in a rented house in Chhola area from October 26 to 31, where she was also raped
 model ke isi bayaan ke aadhaar par police ne sivam ke khilaaf maamla darj kar liya he
 The JD (U), the ally of Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi's 'aspiration' to become the prime ministerial candidate of the NDA, continued the storm
 do divasiy rashtriya baithak ke aakhri din ravivaar ko jahaan jad(you) ne 'piem in vatting' kaa naam jaahir karne ke liye bhaajapa ko disambar tak kaa samay diya, vahiin bagaiyr naam liye modi ko netaa maanane se inkaar kar diya
 On the other hand, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) President Rajnath Singh has indicated the growing tension over the question of leadership in the alliance by calling Modi the 'most popular leader' in the party
 unhone kaha he ki adhyaksh hone ke baavjood vah yah nahin kah sakate ki bhaajapa sansadeey dal kaa faisla kya hoga, lekin saaf he ki modi party ke sabase lokapriy netaa hai
 Janata Dal (united) president Sharad Yadav, however, showed some leniency by saying that the party's alliance with the BJP is very old and "we don't want to break it
" " Not taking Narendra Modi's name, Yadav said, "we have nothing to do with any particular person
 ham pichley 17 saal se rashtriya janatantric gathbandhan (rajg) ke saath hai

 Yet it continues till now

 Nitish said that his party's alliance with the BJP can only run when the situation is clear on 'some fundamental issues'
 nitish ne purv pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi kii us salaah kaa bhi ullekh kiya jisamen unhone varsh 2002 ke gujarat dangon ke samay modi ko 'rajdharm' nibhaane kii salaah di thi

 Nitish said, "the people of the country may not be very educated, but they are intelligent
" " Taking a dig at Narendra Modi, who described Gujarat as a model of economic development, Nitish also said that Bihar is also a model of economic development, where the interests of all sections of society are taken care of
 party ke rashtriya sammelan main nitish ne kaha, "ham kis tarah kaa vikaas chaahate hai? ham aisa vikaas nahin chaahate, jisamen ek badi aabaadi pine ke pani se vanchit rahe or mahilaayein kuposhan kii shikaar rah jaaen

 bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah ke gandhinagar seat se chunaav ladane kii ghoshnaa ke baad ravivaar ko 15 bijepi ummidavaaron ke naam bhi ghoshit kiye gaye hai

 In this series, the Central Government has now sought applications for 40 posts of Deputy Secretary and Director level
 lekin pehle or ab kii niyuktiyon main ek bada antar yah he ki pehle kii niyuktiyaan sangh lok seva ayog dwaara kii gai thim, jo desh kii sarvopari sanvaidhanik bhartee agency he
 Now appointments will be made by NITI Aayog
 yah ek jabardast nitigat parivartan he
 Only the Deputy Secretary and the Director go on to become Joint Secretary, which is a practical level executive post of the Government of India
 in staron main kii jane vaali ye niyuktiyaan is baat kaa sanket detii maaloom pad rahi hai ki inamen se daksh logon ko sanyukt sachiv pad kii jimmedaari di ja sakati he
 Since they will have already become familiar with the functioning of the government, they will be able to fulfill the responsibilities of higher positions more well

 hamaari prashasnic pranali kii bahut badi vidmbana yah he ki desh kii anya sabhi sevaayen IAS dwaara niyantrit hoti hai
 The ridiculous thing is that these people had no knowledge about that department before this
 lekin aate hi unhen sarvagyani maan liya jaataa he, or us vibhaag ke bare main unke vichaar evam nirnay hi maanya hote hai
 The country has been suffering this crisis for the last so many years
 yahaan meraa prashn yah he ki jab sarkaar ko desh ke comptrollar and auditor general (CAG) kii niyukti kerani hoti he, to iske liye vah audit and account sarvice ke adhikariyon kii ore kyon nahi dekhati
 Why become Secretary IAS of various ministries, even though its professionals are already in that ministry
 
 
 ? jaahir he, IAS dwaara shasit hone ke kaaran ye visheshgy atyant upekshit or apamaanit mahasoos karte hai
 By giving them equal opportunities as IAS, the government can utilize their potential and subject expertise properly
 chunki ye sarkaar kii karypranali se bahut acchhee tarah parichit hote hai, isliye ye adhik suvidhajanak bhi honge
 There is an urgent need to take necessary steps in this direction
