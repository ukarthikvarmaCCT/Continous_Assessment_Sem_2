 ' rafel deal (rafale Deal) par kaig(cag) kii bahupratikshit report guuruuvaar ko sansad main pesh hui
 In this report, almost the entire process related to the purchase of Rafale aircraft has been investigated
 magar 16 pannon kii report main sabase bada sawaal anuttarit rah gaya
 On this question, the opposition has always surrounded the government from Parliament to the road
 yah sawaal he rafel vimaanon kii keemat kaa
 The entire CAG report on Rafael does not mention the actual price of Rafale
 jahaan keemat kii baat he, vahaan par code ke rup main U1
 
 
 Like words have been used
 matlab ananon million euro
 That is, the code word is used only for how much Rafale aircraft was purchased
 ab yah ananon milin euro kya he, iske bare main rafel kii report main koi zikr nahin he
 After reading the report, it is found that the CAG has mentioned more about the process adopted by the government and its responses
 ananon milin euro ke aadhaar par nai deal ko puraani deal se sasta bataaya he
 But the question is that anon million euros
 
 
 
 What is the amount of money? 
 
 yun to sansad main ek sawaal ke jawaab main 2016 main hi modi sarkaar yah bataa chuki he ki bina hathiyaaron vaale ek rafel vimaan kii keemat 570 karod rupee he
 But the arrogant Weaponized means armed Rafale has been raging on the prices of the aircraft
 hathiyaaron se las 36 rafel vimaanon kii keemat yah kahkar sarkaar bataane se inkaar karti rahi he ki bharat or sarkaar ke bich vimaanon kii kharid ko lekar hue inter governmental engrement(iga) kii kuch sharten isaki ijaajat nahin deteen
 The government has been saying that it cannot disclose the real prices in view of the conditions related to national security and confidentiality of the agreement
 vipaksh bhi har baar rafel vimaanon kii asal keemten saarvajanik karne kii maang uthaata rahaa he

 america duutavas par pradarshnakariyon va suraksha balon ke bich hue sangharsh main marane waalon kii sankhya badhkar teen ho gai he
 The attack in Yemen was part of an angry outburst in the Islamic world against an alleged insult to Prophet Mohammed in an American film
 khabaron ke mutabik haadi ne ek bayaan jari kar kaha, 'main sanaa main america duutavas par hue aakraamak hamale ke liye america raashtrapati baraak obama va unke desh ke logon se maafee maangata hum
 He said that the people who attacked him were crowds and had no idea of its far-reaching consequences

 loksabhaa chunaavon ke thik pehle nagpur main baithak bulaakar alaakaman ne saaf kar diya he ki sangh or bhaajapa saath saath yani parivaar saath chale tabhi bhala hoga
 Nagpur filled with BJP banners, posters yahaan koi chunaav nahin lekin chunavi bigul se pehle kii taiyaari jarur he
 The BJP will decide the electoral agenda by meeting the National Council and Executive for three days, but before setting the agenda, the bjp's concern is also how to strengthen the clan and how the whole family united in the battle
 bhaajapa ke chunavi agenda to teen dinon kii bahes main tay honge lekin nagpur main baithak kar party ne ye sandesh pehle hi de diya he ki agenda chalegaa to sangh parivaar kaa hi
 It was something else before
 kabhi mandir ke mudde ne to kabhi jaateey sameekaran ne bijepi kaa bedaa paar lagaaya lekin is baar mushkilen thodi alag hai
 The leader is certain but the issue of hitting the ground is not found
 narebaaji ke sahare bedaa paar lage to aakhir kaise
 Although the BJP is busy in wooing the Sangh, but whether the Sangh will be with it or not will be decided in the RSS working committee to be held in Bhopal a few days later
 mahilaon ke shashaktikaran or mahilaon ke khilaaf aparaadh kii badhati ghatnaon par congress upaadhyaksh ke haal ke bayanon ke baad yah sawaal uthanaa laazmi he ki mahilaon se jude mudde sansad main baithe kanoon nirmaataaon ke kaanon main bhi gunj rahe hai yaa nahin
 Now that the term of the 15th Lok Sabha is nearing completion, there is a dire need to ask the question whether our mps who speak so highly will also enact laws to protect the rights of women
 is disha main ab tak kiye kaamon kii padtaal karne par pataa chalata he ki mahilaon ke muddon par sansad main jo kanoon banaae gaye hai, ve satahi or taatkaalik hai
 While there has been an overall parliamentary slowness in passing laws, legislative steps on women's issues have been under pressure rather than being active
 agar koi kanoon bana bhi he to vah janata kii baari maang yaa nyaaypalika kii ore se dakhal dene ke baad hi banaaya gaya he
 If we look at how much work the 15th Lok Sabha did on women's issues, two special efforts are seen
 2001 main vidhi ayog or usase pehle rashtriya mahila ayog mahilaon ke khilaaf aparaadhon-jinamein yon aparaadhon se lekar tejaab se hamalaa bhi shaamil tha-main kadi sajaa sunishchit karne ke liye bhartiya dand samhita main sudhaar karne kii sifarish kar chuke the
 Despite this, the bill was introduced in the Parliament in 2012 and action on these recommendations started when the government was under tremendous pressure after the much talked-about gang rape in Delhi
 aakhirkaar sansad ne is ore dhyaan diya or march 2013 main dand samhita (sanshodhan) vidheyak paarit kiya gaya taaki mahilaon ke khilaaf aparaadhon ke liye kade kadam uthaae ja saken
 While it is necessary that the legislature should be sensitive to public sentiments, it is worrisome that major legal changes were made only when the public came out on the streets to raise their voice
 1997 main kaarysthal par yon utpeeda ke maamle main vishakha faisle ko hi lijie, supreme court ne kaarysthal par mahilaon ke yon utpeeda ko rokane ke liye kuch khaas disha-nirdesh tay kiye the
 The Visakha Guidelines defined sexual harassment and created a code of conduct for measures to prevent it from employers
 lekin sansad ne kaarysthal par mahilaon ko yon utpeeda se bachaane ke liye kanoon 2013 main jaakar paarit kiya
 Laws and rules that gave effect to its provisions were enacted in December last year, when the media brought to light the ever increasing incidents of sexual harassment
 rajnatik padon par mahilaon ko zyada pratinidhitiv dene ke liye sansad ne utani tatparta nahin dikhaai jitne kii jarurat thi
 Many committees and institutions have advocated the need for reservation for women in Parliament and political parties over the years
 chune hue nikaayon main mahilaon ko aarakshan dene ke liye is samay teen prastaav sansad kii manjuuri ke liye lambit hai
 The Women's Reservation Bill contains a provision to reserve one-third of seats for women in the Lok Sabha and legislative assemblies
 110wein or 112wein samvidhan sanshodhan vidheyak main panchayat or nagarpalika main yah aarakshan kul siton ke ek-tihaai se badhaakar 50 fisadi kar diya gaya he
 If all these bills are not passed even in the last session of the 15th Lok Sabha, then they will become useless
 in vidheyakon ko paarit karne ke liye rajnatik ichhashakti kii kami isi baat se pataa chalati he ki sansad or vidhansabhaon main mahilaon ko aarakshan dene ke liye kanoon banane kii pichley sabhi prayaas asafal rahe hai
 Several bills were introduced in 1996, 1998 and 1999 with the same purpose, but the dissolution of those Loksabhas became useless
 mahilaon ke muddon se sambandhit duusare maamalon main sansad ne kanoon banane ke liye apane adhikaar kaa zyada vivekpurna istemaal nahin kiya he
 For example, the Marriage Laws (amendment) Bill calls for an amendment in the laws of divorce and marriage
 yah bill nishchit vivaah-viched ko talaak kaa nayaa aadhaar banane kii baat karata he or adaalat ko ijaajat detaa he ki vah patni or bacchon ke muaavje kaa nirdhaaran karte samay pati ko viraasat main mil chuki yaa baad main viraasat main praapt hone vaali sampatti kaa moolyankan kare
 a modification of the obscene portrayal of women law prohibits the publication or distribution of any material related to women that is indecent to a woman
 yah internet, upgrah aadhaarit sanchaar or cabel televijan jaise sanchaar ke nae madhyamon par bhi lagu hota he
 Apart from this, it is also proposed to create the first central university which is only for women so that they can get better opportunities for higher education and jobs
 lekin sansad ne inamen se kisi bhi vidheyak ko paarit nahin kiya he
 It is a matter of concern that the Parliament has resolved the issues related to women in a moving manner and not by deliberation
 samay aa gaya he ki hamaare kanoon nirmaataa dabaav ke fori kaarnon se nahin, balki pehle se acchhee tarah vichaar karke sachche man se kanoon banane kaa moulik prayaas karen
 (mandira Kala heads PRS Legislative Research) rus ne syria main sanyukt raashtra nirikshakon ke bane rahane kii himaayat karte hue kaha ki abhiyaan ko waapas bulaane se 'behad nakaaratmak parinaam' ho sakate hai

 samachar agency interfaques ne videsh mantralay ke hawaale se bataaya ki abhiyaan ke swaroop main badlaav laayaa ja saktaa he lekin ise puri tarah se band nahin kiya ja saktaa kyonki sanyukt raashtra kaa yah abhiyaan yahaan se mul suchanaaen praapt karne kaa mahatvapurn strot he

 The Shiv Sena, often targeting its ally BJP, attacked Yogi Adityanath, the new Chief Minister of the BJP government in UP, saying that administration of a big state like Uttar Pradesh is not as easy as running a monastery
 shivasena ne yogi adityanath ko naseehat bhi di he ki unhen apane 'dharmik kartavyon' kaa paalan karne se zyada sushasan par dhyaan kendrit karnaa chahie
 The comments shivasena ne apane mukhpatr 'saamana' main likhe gaye sampadakeey main uttar pradesh main do up-mukhyamantriyon kii niyukti ke mudde par apni sahyogi party bhaajapa ko aade haath lete hue shivasena ne kaha ki is kadam kaa makasad adityanath ko apane dharmik kartavyon kaa paalan karne ke liye swatantra rakhana he
 Significantly, Yogi Adityanath is the head of Gorakhpur Math
 shivasena ne sampadakeey main likhaa, 'uttar pradesh main do up-mukhyamantriyon kii niyukti kii gai he, jabaki maharashtra ke liye bhaajapa ne kaha tha ki up-mukhyamantri kii niyukti unki niti ke vipareet he
 He joined pdp's Mehbooba Mufti to get the post of Deputy Chief Minister in Jammu and Kashmir
 ' Significantly, in 2014, the BJP refused to give the post of Deputy Chief Minister to Shiv Sena in Maharashtra
 haalanki shivasena ne kaha he ki yogi adityanath ko mukhyamantri banane se ram mandir nirmaan ke kaam main teji aegi or hindutvvaadi takaton main nai urja kaa sanchaar hoga lekin naukariyaan paidaa karnaa bhi ahm he or yogi ko iske liye kaam karnaa hoga
 Yogi Adityanath was sworn in as the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh on Sunday
 bhaajapa ke pradesh adhyaksh keshav prasad maury or party ke rashtriya upaadhyaksh dinesh sharma ko rajya kaa up-mukhyamantri niyukt kiya gaya he
 In an editorial written in its mouthpiece 'saamana', Shiv Sena lashed out at its ally BJP BJP over the issue of appointing two Deputy Chief Ministers in Uttar Pradesh, saying that the move was aimed at Adityanath to perform his religious duties
 Have to keep free
 gauratlab he ki yogi adityanath gorakhpur math ke pramukh hai
 The Shiv Sena wrote in the editorial, "two Deputy Chief Ministers have been appointed in Uttar Pradesh, while for Maharashtra, BJP had said that the appointment of Deputy Chief Ministers is contrary to their policy
" jammu-kashmir main up-mukhyamantri kaa pad paane ke liye ve pidipi kii mahabuuba mufti ke saath mil gaye
 ' gauratlab he ki 2014 main bhaajapa ne maharashtra main shivasena ko up-mukhyamantri kaa pad dene se inkaar kar diya tha
 Though the Shiv Sena has said that making Yogi Adityanath the chief minister will speed up the work of building the Ram temple and the Hindutva forces will infuse new energy but creating jobs is also important and Yogi will have to work for it
 beete ravivaar ko yogi adityanath ne uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri ke taur par shapath lee thi
 BJP state president Keshav Prasad Maurya and party's national vice president Dinesh Sharma have been appointed as deputy chief ministers of the state

 america ke think tanks PEW research centre ne kaha he ki varsh 2070 tak duniya main sabase adhik aabaadi musalamaanon kii hogi
 The Research Center has reported that between 2010 and 2050, the Muslim population will increase by 73 percent, while Christians will increase by 35 percent
 report ke anusaar is samaykaal main duniya kii aabaadi kariban 37 pratishat tak bad jaaegi
 It also states that if the population of Muslims increases at this pace, then by 2070, the maximum population in this world will be Muslims
 bhartiya imigrents ne america ko di hai kharbon rupee kii companiyambharat main honge sabase zyada muslimis samay indonesia ko sabase bada muslim aabaadi vaala desh bataaya gaya he par pu research centre ne ye kaha he ki saal 2050 tak bharat main sabase adhik muslim honge
 Their total population in India will be around 30 crores
 UNESCO 2017 kii report, padhai ke liye bhartiya chaatro kii pehali pasand he americakyon bad rahe muslimpyu research centre kii report main kaha gaya he ki musalamaanon kii aabaadi badhane ke do kaaran hai
 First, the population growth rate of Muslims is higher than other religions
 report ke anusaar, vaishvik str par muslim mahila ke ausatan 3
 There are 1 child while in other religions this average is 2
 3 he
 The second reason is their youth population
 yuva aabaadi kaa matlab he musalamaanon kii badi aabaadi yaa to bachche paidaa kar rahi he yaa bhavishya main karegi
 Hearing on the petition filed for population control in the Delhi High Court, the petition was filed by the BJP spokesperson and lawyer Ashwani Upadhyay
 mangalvaar ko sunwaayee ke dauraan court ne kaha ki jansankhya niyantran par niti bananaa hamaara kaam nahin he
 This is the work of the central government
 hai court ne is yachika kaa nipataara ye kah kar diya ki is maamle main yachikakarta centre sarkaar se sampark kare or apane suzav sarkaar ko de
 The court said in its order that the work of framing policies for population control is with the Parliament and the legislature, how can the court interfere with it
 court kaa kaam kanoon kii vyakhya karnaa he yaa phir sarkaar dwaara banaai gai nitiyon kaa paalan nahin kar rahaa ho to uske liye alag-alag vibhaagon ko nirdesh dena he
 It is the right of the government to enact laws for population control
 agar yah kaam bhi court karne lagegaa to use sarkaar ke kai vibhaagon ke liye kaam karnaa padegaa
 Therefore, we do not think that the court has any need to hear this PIL
 sunwaayee ke dauraan court ne kaha ki rajya or centre sarkaar ye nitiyaan banane main sakasham hai ki sarkari naukari, kisi bhi tarah kii sabsidi, vot dene kaa adhikaar, chunaav ladane kaa adhikaar yaa sampatti par adhikaar aam aadmi apane parivaar ko sirf do bacchon tak hi simit kar de
 It is not up to the court to direct the government to make policies
 may main lagaai gai is yachika main centre sarkaar se jansankhya niyantran ke liye jaruri kadam uthaane kii maang kii gai thi
 This petition was filed on behalf of BJP spokesperson and lawyer Ashwani Kumar Upadhyay on the basis that population explosion is the main reason for crime, increasing pollution and lack of jobs in the country, hence it is necessary to stop it
 yachika main jansankhya niyantran ke liye nyaayamurti venkatchalaiya kii aguwai main rashtriya samvidhan samiksha ayog (ensiardablusi) kii siforishein lagu karne kaa bhi anurodh kiya gaya tha
 The petition requires certain rules to be strictly followed to prevent population control, and anyone who does not cooperate in population control should be denied facilities such as the right to vote, the right to contest elections and free legal aid
 yachika ke mutabik, do bacchon ke baad family planning ko anivaary kiya janaa chahie
 The Law Commission should also prepare its report in this matter and give directions as to what measures can be taken to keep the population under control
 kyonki jansankhya ko agar is vakt niyantrit nahin kiya gaya to bharat ko iske bhayankar dushprinaam bhavishya main bhi bhugatne padenge
 Today, farming land is less and people have become more

 " diarector anubhav sinha ne 'tum bin' ke baad, 'tum bin 2' banaai or ab film relies hone ko taiyaar he
 Anubhav has told his story remembering the days of 'tum Bin'
 anubhav ne kaha, 'tum bin 2' kii neenv 2001 main rakhi gai thi
 Even after the release of 'tum Bin', his craze is alive in the people
 2011 -12 main jab main twitor par active ho gaya to logon kii tarif or demand aane lagi
 People used to praise 'tum Bin' and started demanding its Part 2
 abhi bhi kuch 23-24 saal ke aise logamiltehain jo kehete hai 'sar tum bin meri fevert film he
 'I think in my mind that by that time, he must have been 7-8 years old, how did he like' Tum Bin 'so much
 baad main pataa chalaa ki un logon ne pehle gane sune the or phir film dekhi thi
 a few years ago, Bhushan Kumar said that 'man, you make bin 2'
 ' lekin mere paas tab koi kahani nahin thi
 Then a story was found in October last year
 maine bhushan ji ko wo kahani sunai, unhone mere haath main 11 rupee nikaalkar de die
 i remember that Bhushan ji gave a signing amount of Rs 11 for 'tum Bin' also in 2001
 haalanki baad main or paise bhi mujhe die gaye
 Where are the actors of 'tum Bin': 'tum Bin' actors are nowhere to be seen today, about this, Anubhav said, 'look at Bhushan Ji, Mary, those four actors; It was our first film
 sandali ne tay kiya tha ki wo 'tum bin' ke baad koi or film nahin karegi, or yakeen maniye jab film ke trailor baahar aae, tab sandali ke liye projects kii line lag gayi
 People used to call me and ask, but i told them that Sandali would not like to work further in films
 rakesh baptka bahut chota role tha
 Himanshu was already a star, also modeled, but i think Priyanshu did not handle his career properly
 unki aage kii filmon kaa chayan sahi nahin tha
 We were all new
 'tum bin' ke saath tulana to hona hi tha:anubhav ne 'tum bin' or 'tum bin 2' kii tulana par kaha, 'dekhie jab mainaankit tiwarike saath mujeec par kaam shuru kiya to maine unhen pehle hi bataa diya tha kii mujeec aate hi pehle din bataaya jayega ki 'tum bin' jaisi baat nahin he, or ye baat 15 -20 din tak chalegi to uske liye taiyaar rahanaa kyonki logon ne us mujeec ko 15 saalon se pyaar kiya he or aaj bhi karte hai
 People will also say that it is not a matter of 'tum Bin'
 haalanki 'tum bin 2' ke pehle hi gane 'teri fariyaad' ko kaaphi saraahaa gaya
 There will be comparisons, but the second part of any film is made only because its first part was successful
 'bataa den, 'tum bin 2', 18 navambar ko relies hogi

 gaanv pahunchane ke baad mantri ne shahid mujahid khan ko shradhanjali di

 ajtak ne jab mantri se sawaal poocha ki aakhir shahid ke antim sanskaar main naa aa paane kii vajah kya thi to mantri ne kaha ki katihaar se bhojpur kii duuri 650 kilometre he or itnaa faasla tay karne main 2 din kaa vakt lag jaataa he

 Following the bandh and incidents of violence, Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh has ordered to cease airing the serial immediately
 unhone rajya main sampradayik sauhaard bhang karne ke prayaason ke khilaaf bhi chetavanee di he
 The Valmiki Action Committee, which is calling for a day-long bandh in the state, claims that objectionable comments have been made against God in the serial 'ram Siya Ke Love Kush' aired on Colors TV
 unki galat chhavi pesh kii gayi or aitihaasik tathyon ke saath chhedchhad kiya gaya he

 rajyasabha ke liye party ke ummidavaar ghoshit karne kii khatir samaajawaadee party (sapa) ke rashtriya adhyaksh mulaayam singh yadav apane awaas par sansadeey board kii baithak kar rahe the
 As soon as Amar Singh was mentioned, cabinet minister Azam Khan's fingers went up
 jab saat ummidavaaron kii suchi main ek bhi musalmaan ko jagah nahin mili to ajam virodh main baithak chhodkar chale gaye
 Two days later, Maulana Syed Ahmed Bukhari, the royal imam of Delhi's Jama Masjid, also reached Mulayam's house to protest against the neglect of Muslims in the selection of Rajya Sabha candidates
 mulaayam ne pichley chunaav main do musalamaanon ko rajyasabha bhejne kii baat kahkar apana paksh rakhaa par kuch 'majaburiyon' ke chalate is baar aisa karne se saaf inkaar kar diya
 a similar 'compulsion' was also that of the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), claiming the votes of Muslims
 pashchimi upi ke kuch bade netaaon ke sujhaavon ko darkinar kar bispi supremeo mayawati ne apni party ke cote kii do rajyasabha siton par satish mishra or ashok siddharth ko utaar diya
 The two largest parties that claim Muslim votes in UP are so complicit in saving their basic caste equations before the 2017 assembly elections that they could not make room for a single Muslim candidate in the Rajya Sabha election
 2012 ke vidhansabha chunaav main pehali baar upi main sarvaadhik 64 musalmaan vidhayak bane (dekhen box) par do saal baad loksabhaa chunaav main koi bhi musalmaan ummidavaar chunaav nahin jeet sakaa
 If we also include the ongoing election process, then after the last Lok Sabha elections, the number of Muslim candidates who won the elections in 21 Rajya Sabha seats of UP will remain 2 (won from SP in November 2014)
 jaahir he, barabari kaa daawa karne vaali siyaasi partiyaan upi kii kul aabaadi main 19
 3% (source: 2011 census) has failed to give fair representation to Muslims with a share
 musalmaan matadaataaon ke mudde or pahchaan ko lekar upje sankat ke bich unke voton kii siyasat doraahe par aa khadi hui he
 This looks like the script of partitioning Muslim votes in UP like in the assembly elections in Assam
 pashchim par khaas nazren2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main ek bhi seat na jeetne vaali bispi ne apane muslim chehre nasimuddin siddiki ko pashchimi upi kii kaman saunpkar danga peedit musalamaanon kii rahanumai shuru kar di thi
 Siddiqui constantly approached the aggrieved Muslims, not only reminding them of Mayawati's good governance but also trying to ease the resentment that stemmed from the bsp's neglect after the Muzaffarnagar riots
 ve musalmaan bahul jilon (dekhen graphics) samet pashchimi upi kii 60 se zyada vidhansabha siton par sabhaayen kar musalmaan ummidavaaron kii ghoshnaa kar chuke hai
 In order to deal with the increasing penetration of BSP among Muslims, SP last year made Ashu Malik of Muradnagar, who is close to Muslim religious leaders, a member of the Legislative Council and later made Kamal Akhtar of Amroha a cabinet minister, taking the number of Muslim ministers in SP government to 11

 Meetings with Mulayam Ulema are giving clarification on non-fulfillment of election promises like implementation of Sachar Committee recommendations, release of innocent Muslims in the name of terrorism
 iske aage sapa sarkaar musalamaanon ko aarakshan dene ke liye samvidhan sanshodhan karne kaa ek prastaav centre sarkaar ko bhejne ja rahi he
 Congress activists have also demanded strategist Prashant Kishore to make former MLA Imran Masood the face of the party in western UP
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main saharanpur se congressi ummidavaar rahe masood ko narendra modi ke khilaaf vivaadaaspad bhaashan dene ke aarope main jail kii hawa khaani padi thi
 The assembly election in Azam vs Nasimuddin Siddiqui will also test the skills of the two Surmas in up's Muslim politics
 bispi ke muslim chehre or rashtriya mahasachiv nasimuddin siddiki pradesh kii dargahon or musalmaan dharmaguruon se sampark sadhakar unhen mayawati ke shasankaal kii yaad dilaakar samarthan bator rahe hai
 If he has emerged as an expert player of the organization, the SP has once again prepared to gather support for Azam Khan in the assembly elections
 march main governor ram nik ke saath vivaad main jis tarah se sapa ke sheersh netaa ajam ke saath khadey dikhe, usamen rampur ke is kaddavar netaa ke sahare musalmaan vot saadhane kii hi manshaa thi
 Known for his bold and outspoken rhetoric, Azam has a strategy of influencing the sp's staunch rhetoric All India majlis-e-etihadul Muslimeen (MIM) national president and Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi in UP
 ajam or ovaisi kii kattar bayaanbaji ke bich bijepi bhi musalamaanon main hone vaale party virdohi dhruvikaran ko thaamne kii ranneeti par kaam kar rahi he
 The Muslim Rashtriya Manch, formed under the patronage of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh officer Indresh Kumar, has organized more than one and a half dozen Ulema conferences in UP in the last one year
 aagaamee ramajaan ke maheene main sangh ne rojaa iftaar party ke bahaane musalamaanon se bhaichara badhaane kii taiyaari kii he
 On the other hand, Union Minority Welfare Minister Najma Heptulla has tried to connect the Muslims with bjp's development agenda in the first phase by opening skill development center in more than one and a half dozen madrasas in UP
 barelvi—devbandi main rassakashidargahon ke shahar bareli main pratishthit qutubakhaana masjid par malikana haq ko lekar pichley ek saal se devbandi or barelvi masalak ke bich vivaad he

 Shahjahanpur, Pilibhit and Bareilly in the Rohelkhand region are strongholds of the Barelvi Maslak, while Deobandis have influence in Rampur, Moradabad
 barelvi imam kii tainaati ke baad se charchaa main aae qutubakhaana masjid prakaran main rajya sarkaar ke dhulmul ravaie se barelvi sapa sarkaar se naaraaz hai
 BSP national general secretary Nasimuddin Siddiqui visited the Dargah Ala Hazrat on 2 February to 'cash in' the growing resentment of the Barelvi community against the SP
 to sapa ne bhi urdu ke mashhoor shaayar wasim barelvi ko vidhaan parishad sadsy manonith kar musalamaanon ke bich punap rahi naaraazgi ko dur karne ke liye apana chirparichit daanv chal diya
 On the other hand, in Lucknow, which has a large number of Shia Muslims, Shia cleric Jawvad has opened a front against the SP government against the occupation of Waqf properties
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main shiya musalamaanon ne lakhanu loksabhaa seat se tatkaaleen ummidavaar rajnath singh ko samarthan diya tha
 Even after becoming an MP, Rajnath has continued to go to Shia events and seek his support
 bado kaa khel bigaadenge chhotepurvanchal main muslim raajnneeti main sapa, bispi jaise dalon kii waisi dhamak nahin sunai de rahi he jaisi ki pashchimi upi main he
 In Purvanchal, the Muslim face of the SP is Ahmed Hassan, a cabinet minister from Ambedkar Nagar, while the BSP has given the command of eastern districts to Munkad Ali, who has pioneered the party's Muslim politics in Western UP
 hakeekat yah he ki ahamed hasan or munkad ali purvanchal ke musalamaanon main apni paith nahin bana paae hai or isi ne yahaan chote dalon ko paanv pasaarne kaa mauka diya he
 Arshad Mansoori, a volunteer working for the betterment of weavers in Purvanchal, says, "backwardness of Muslims is the main issue in the eastern districts
 upi main sakriy bade siyaasi dal musalamaanon se samvaad sthapit karne main philhal naakaam sabit hue hai
 This emptiness has made room for smaller Muslim parties
 '' emiem ne isi jagah ko bharne main purvanchal main puri takat jhonk di he
 The MIM, which garnered more than 12,000 votes in the February Assembly bypolls in Bikapur, Faizabad, is seen by political analysts as a 'vote-cut', which can spoil the game of big parties
 pichley vidhansabha chunaav main purvanchal kii kai siton par sapa ke saath najdiki mukaable main bispi ko pis party kii upasthiti akhar gai thi
 Similarly, Owaisi's party may harm SP in the next assembly elections

 According to the BJP, the Congress is afraid of the upper castes and farmers going into the bjp's court due to these decisions of the Modi government
 purv mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ne somvaar ko kaha ki modi ji ne centre sarkaar ne saamaanya varg ke garibon ke liye 10 fisadi aarakshan diya he
 Many states have implemented it, but the Government of Madhya Pradesh is sitting on this

 So far, the data of 5 hectare farmers has not been made available by the government of Madhya Pradesh to the central government, so rupees have not reached the account of farmers of Madhya Pradesh
 tomars ne kamalnath se maang karte hue kaha ki madhya pradesh sarkaar jaldi se jaldi data bhejein jisase centre sarkaar unke khate main paisa bhejne kaa kaam kar sake
 Congress accuses- BJP only makes jumlebaji, Congress believes that Madhya Pradesh government is taking concrete steps in the interest of all sections

 Public Relations Minister PC Sharma stood the BJP in the dock, saying that for so many years, the BJP did not remember the farmers and the unemployed and therefore without any concrete preparation or action plan before the elections

 Swami Avimukteshwaranand, who is running in the Supreme Court on the issue of Ram temple, also said that the political parties as well as the court should not interfere in the Ram temple issue
 swami avimukteshwaranand ne kaha ki ayodhya main ram mandir bananaa mudda nahin he balki ram janmabhumi mudda he or ram janmabhumi hinduon kii he
 Swami Avimukteshwarananda said that 67 acres of Ram Janmabhoomi is already with the Government of India and in such a situation people have to be fooled after bringing an ordinance to build a temple on it
 swami ne kaha ki jab ram janm bhoomi kii saraswat acre jameen pehle se hi sarkaar ke paas he to phir kis cheez kaa adhyadesh laana he ? swami avimukteshwaranand ne kaha ki agar ramajnmabhumiki 67 acre jameen kisi or ke paas hoti to adhyadesh laane kii baat sahi hoti
 After returning to power in 1980, the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi considered a military attack on its nuclear installations to prevent Pakistan from acquiring nuclear weapons capabilities

 An edited version of the 12-page document was put on the CIA website in June this year, according to which, in 1981, the then Indian government led by Indira Gandhi was concerned about the progress of Pakistan's nuclear weapons program and believed Islamabad to acquire nuclear weapons
 Is close to america kaa bhi isi tarah kaa aankalan tha
 The then-susceptible CIA report claimed that if India's concerns escalate in the next two or three months, we believe that the conditions may be such as Prime Minister Gandhi's decision to primarily demolish Pakistan's nuclear facilities
 To provide a framework, a military confrontation should be initiated with Pakistan
 report likhane ke samay siie ne kaha ki gandhi ne is sambandh main is tarah kaa koi faisla nahin kiya
 According to the report, as Pakistan was in the final stages of making plutonium and rich uranium for use in nuclear weapons, Gandhi gave a clear answer to this threat by authorizing Indian nuclear test preparations
 siie ne kaha ki farvari 1981 main kam samay main bhartiya pareekshan upkaran ke bhumigat visphot ko anumati dene ke liye thar marusthal main khudaai shuru kii gai
 The CIA said that India had completed preparations for a 40 kiloton nuclear test in May
 unhone kaha ki kaha gaya ki bharat ko pakistan ke sambhavit pareekshan ke kareeb ek saptaah baad divaais main visphot karnaa tha
 The comments siie ne kaha ki spasht he ki bharat sarkaar ne aankalan kiya ki pakistani parmaanu visphot rashtriya suraksha ke liye khatra nahin hoga or shantipurna parmaanu visphot kaarykram kii bahaali se kshetra main bharat kii shreshthata kii chhavi ke nuksaan ko kam kiya ja saktaa he
 It said, 'prime Minister Gandhi probably chose not to use the military option against Pakistan
 durtam maamle main, agar sainya vikalp ke upyog ke liye anukool samay se pehle pakistan ko epa 16 (ladaaku vimaan) dene ko lekar bharat kii chintaaen badhati hai to pradhanmantri gandhi ke liye sambhavit apatkaaleen hamale kii yojana puri karne ke liye sthitiyaan purna ho sakati hai

 It was then seen how many of the solutions that came out of the first study to resolve the quarrel were those which the people involved in the second study also want

 He said, 'what the couples want during the debate depends on their underlying concern and how to deal with the conflict

 He came into the news as well as on social media, after the vice-chancellor of Banaras Hindu University described the alleged sexual harassment case of girls as 'normal incidents' of molestation
 kulapati girish chandra treepathi yah bhi maanate hai ki biechayu parisar main hui yah ghatana pradhanmantri narendra modi ke apane sansadeey kshetra ke daure ke thik ek din pehle 'jaanboojhkar' saamne laai gai thi
 Let us tell you that after the harassment of a student in BHU campus and after her complaint was not helped by the security personnel, all the students there started demonstrations with some other demands demanding their safety
 
 visi treepathi ke anusaar,virodh raajnneeti se preritatha or "kuch log nihit swaarthon or aniyamit iraadon ke chalate is ghatana ko prerit kar rahe the" unhone yah bhi kaha ki piem modi kii yatra se pehle is baat ko bhadakaane ke liye hi chhedchhad kii gai thi
 BHU students have claimed that there is no girl in the university who has not been harassed or molested on campus
 lekin, BHU ke visi girish chandra treepathi ke paas ek alag hi kahani he
 Now read those 10 statements of VC Tripathi
 
 
 1- "kabhi-kabhi mudde hote hai or kuch mudde paidaa hote hai
 This issue was created
 mujhe lagata he ki yah samasya bahari logon dwaara banaai gai thi or jo is maamle ne ant main jo aakaar liya vah praarambhik ghatana se bhi zyada durbhagyapurna he
 "2-" First of all, this is not an incident of sexual harassment, it is a case of unrest

 "4-" If force was used on girls, i have no idea

 "7- "agar ham har ladki kii har maang ko sunne lagen to ham vishvavidhyalay nahin chalaa paaenge

 " The DGMO Lieutenant General Ranbir Singh himself gave information about the surgical strike of the Indian Army on September 29 on terrorist targets in pok
 elosi paar kar sena kaa oparation karnaa or phir uski baqayada press conference main jaankaree die janaa, desh ke logon ke liye ye nai baat thi
 Then questions also arose whether the Indian Army crossed the loc for the first time and carried out the surgical strike? Has the Indian Army never done this before? In such a situation, some claims were made that earlier such operations have been done by the Indian Army, but their information was never made public
 'india today / aaj tak' ne sargical strix ke ateet kii tah ko khangaalane kii koshish kii
 The result of this is shocking
 beete 18 saal main kam se kam 9 baar bhartiya sena ne elosi ke paar jaakar oparations ko anjaam diya or pakistani sena ko sabak sikhaaya
 In this period, the first incident of crossing the loc from the Indian Army occurred in May 1998
 vahiin 29 sitambar ke haalia sargical strike se pehle aakhri baar agast 2013 membhartiya senaane elosi ko paar kiya tha
 In between these two incidents also, in the summer of 1999, January 2000, March 2000, September 2003, June 2008, August 2011 and January 2013, the Indian Army crossed the loc for operations 7 times
 may, 1998 se agast 2013 ke bich bhartiya sena neelosi crosskar jo 9 oparation anjaam die, unke bare main bhartiya sarkaar ne naa to kabhi saarvajanik taur par sweekaar kiya or naa hi kabhi ye jaankaree di ki in oparations ko anjaam dete vakt elosi ke donon taraf kitna nuksaan hua
 'india Today / Aaj Tak' cross-checked media reports of the last two decades, apart from talking to the country's highly placed intelligence sources and retired army officers
 isi ke aadhaar par aap tak pahunch rahaa he bhartiya sena ke purv main elosi paar kar kiye gaye 9 oparations kaa byoraa
 1
 may 1998pakistan ne khud bhartiya sena ke is oparation kii sanyukt raashtra se 1998 main shikaayat kii
 This complaint is registered on page 321 of the United Nations Annual Book 1998
 iske mutabik pakistan ne 4 may ko shikaayat main kaha ki pioke main elosi ke 600 meter paar bandala seri main 22 logon ko maar daalaa gaya
 Quoting some eyewitnesses present in the village of Pakistan, it was also told, 'about a dozen people came in midnight in black clothes
 unhone kuch parche bhi chode jis par ek main likhaa tha- 'badla brigade'
 On the other leaflet, it was written - 'bad result of bad work
 ' ek or parche par likhaa tha- ek aankh ke badale 10 ankhen, ek daant ke badale puraa jabaada
 'when Pakistan raised a finger on the Indian government for this attack, New Delhi refused to take responsibility
 haalanki us vakt kuch america adhikariyon kii ore se mana gaya tha ki ye karrwai pathankot or dhakikot ke gaavon main 26 bhartiya nagarikon kii hatya ke badale main kii gai thi

 greeshmakaal 19991999 kii garmiyon menkargil yudhke dauraan bhartiya sena kii tukdi jammu ke paas munaavar tavi nadi se elosi ko cross kiya tha
 In this operation an entire Pakistan outpost was blown up
 usee ghatana ke baad pakistan ne border ection team (BAT) kaa gathan kiya tha
 It included commandos of Pakistan's Special Service Group (SAG)
 janvari main ek bhartiya sainik kaa sir kalam kar dene ke liye BAT ko hi jimmedaar mana jaataa he

 janvari 2000kargil yuddh ke 6 maheene baad 21-22 janvari 2000 ko neelam nadi ke paar nadala enklev main ek post par red ke dauraan 7 pakistani sainikon ko kathith taur par pakade jane kaa daawa kiya gaya tha
 According to Pakistan, these seven soldiers were injured in the firing of Indian soldiers
 baad main in sainikon ke shavon ko pakistan ko waapas kar diya gaya tha
 According to the report of the newspaper 'the Hindu', a senior officer of the Pakistani DGMO had said that Pakistan did not deliberately inflame the incident
 is adhikari ke mutabik general musharraf ko takhtapalat kiye kuch hi din hue the or wo nahin chaahate the ki is par logon main zyada shor mache or bharat ke saath phir sankat utpann ho
 Sources in the Indian Army said that this action was taken on behalf of the Indian Army after the martyrdom of Captain Saurabh Kalia and five soldiers of the 4 Jat Regiment - soldiers Bhanwar Lal Bagriya, Arjun Ram, Bhikha Ram, Moola Ram and Naresh Singh
 4
 March 2000 Sources say that after the Kargil war, Captain Gurjinder Singh of the deployed 12 Bihar Battalion crossed the loc with a team of infantry battalion commandos (lethal) and attacked the Pakistani post
 ye pakistani sena ke purv main kiye gaye hamale kii javaabi karrwai thi
 Captain Suri was martyred in this operation of India
 unhen maranoparant mahavir chakra se sammanit kiya gaya
 Meanwhile, on 2 March 2000, lashkar-e-taiba militants killed 35 Sikhs in an attack
 tab atal bihari vaajapeyi sarkaar kii ore se 9 para (special forcej) ko sarhad paar kar karrwai kii anumati di gai thi
 After this, Indian soldiers led by the Special Forces Major crossed the loc and carried out the work of 28 Pakistani soldiers and terrorists
 5
 Since the ceasefire was implemented on the loc in September 20032003 in both countries, little information is available about the operation going on the land of the other
 lekin pakistan kii ore se elosi par nigaraanee vaale sanyukt raashtra preshak dal (UNMOGIP) ko darj shikayaton se pataa chalata he ki cross border oparations badastoor jari rahe
 Pakistan claimed in a complaint that Indian soldiers attacked a post on 18 September 2003 in the Baroh sector near Poon's Bhimbar Gali
 is ghatana main pakistani jesio samet 4 jawan maare gaye
 6
 june 20082008 main bhi kam se kam do baar aisi ghatnaayen huin
 This was the year when incidents of collision on the loc started increasing
 pakistan kii shikayaton ke record ke mutabik poonch ke bhattal sector main 19 june 2008 ko bhartiya sainikon kii karrwai main chaar pakistani jawan maare gaye
 Earlier on 5 June 2008, there was an attack on Kranti Border Surveillance Post in Salhotri village of Poona, in which Javaswar Chavar, a soldier of 2-8 Gurkha Regiment, was killed
 7
 August 2011 On 30 August 2011, Pakistan lodged a complaint that four of its soldiers, including one of its jcos, were killed in action by the Indian Army near the Neelum River Valley in Kell
 akhbaar 'da hindu' ne is ghatana par sutron ke hawaale se bataaya tha ki ye oparation karnah me bhartiya javaanon par hamale main do bhartiya sainikon kii hatya or unke shavon ko kshatvikshat kiye jane ke badale main kiya gaya tha
 8
 janvari 2013'da hindu' kii ek report main 6 janvari 2013 kii ek ghatana kaa is tarah zikr he
 After the cross border firing on the night of 6 January 2013, 19 Infantry Division Commander Gulab Singh Rawat sought permission to attack the Pakistani post
 is pakistani post se bhartiya sainikon ko nishaanaa banaaya ja rahaa tha
 Pakistan was again told that its posts in Sawan Patra were attacked by Indian soldiers
 haalanki bharat ne pakistan ke is daawey kaa us vakt khandan kiya
 Jagdish Dahiya, the then spokesman of the Indian Army, said- 'none of our soldiers crossed the loc
 'is ghatana par ek varisht adhikari ne dilli main kaha, 'ise is tarah dekha janaa chahie
 There was no formal permission to cross the loc to target Sawan Patra
 lekin tanaav kii garmi main is tarah kii chijen hoti rahati hai
 Pakistan does this, our army does this
 ye 1990 main jammu-kashmir main ladaai shuru hone ke baad se hi chal rahaa he
 '9
 agast 2013agast 2013 ke shuru main jaafaran gulam sarwar, waajid akbar, mohammad waajid akbar or mohammad faisal ne neelam ghati main pakistan ke kabje vaale kshetra main apane gharon ko choda tha, lekin uske baad kabhi waapas nahin aae
 India said that it does not know what happened to these people
 pakistan ke mutabik in chaaron ke gaayab hone ke kuch din baad hi khabar ai ki paanch agyaat log bhartiya sainikon kii firing main maare gaye
 Their bodies were found 500 meters across the loc in the occupied territory of India
 us vakt bhartiya sena ke pravaktaa naresh vij ne kaha, 'koi shav nahin mila or wo (pakistan) aise jhooth bolte rahe hai
 'however, Indian intelligence officers stationed in the sector believed off the record that these people were indeed killed in the action of Special Forces
 haalanki in khufia adhikariyon kaa ye bhi kanaha tha ki ye saare log jihadi sanghathan se the or elosi se ghuspaith karnaa chaah rahe the
 According to these officials, the army never takes any action against any innocent citizen
 ye the beete 18 saal ke wo 9 vaakye jab bhartiya sena ne elosi ke paar jaakar oparation ko anjaam diya tha
 Out of these 9 operations, only the first operation in May 1998 was officially accepted by Pakistan
 baaki sabhi oparations ko naam nahin kholane kii shart par bhartiya adhikariyon ne mana ki wo hakeekat main hue the
 In such a situation, the possibility that many more operations would have taken place in the last 18 years, but they were not sparked by both India and Pakistan
 aisa isliye hua ki sarhad par zyada tanaav naa bade
 After the last years of the 90s, there have been many significant changes on the loc, at least towards India
 ab yahaan teen stareey suraksha he
 Machine guns, ground and motion sensors operated by remote control, monitored through drones and state-of-the-art new construction etc
 can be seen here
 lekin is sabake baavjood is puure arse main elosi ke paar jaakar oparations ko anjaam dena jari rahaa
 That is, there were no such changes from Pakistan which made the loc to be considered impenetrable
 29 sitambar ke bhartiya sena ke sargical strike ko lekar utana hi sach abhi tak saamne aayaa he jitna dijiemo kii ore se bataaya gaya
 But only after this surgical strike, take a look at the history that raises questions
 elosi paar kar donon taraf se is tarah ke oparations ko anjaam die janaa pehle bhi hota rahaa he
 Smartphone users across the country are very excited about running 4G internet these days

 Hollywood actor Arnold Schwarzenegger says that the nude scene in the upcoming film Terminator Genisys was embarrassing but fun for him
 unhone kaha ki vah is seen ko lekar behad ghabaraae hue the, lekin unhone isko injoy kiya
 Schwarzenegger told a website, 'nude scenes are an embarrassment, but they are fun
 inamen haasyaaspad baatcheet or dialog hote hai

 It is fun 'input: IANS Asaram may be in jail, but this time a Holi festival to be held in his Surat ashram for the last 20 years was also held
 ashram main sant mahasammelan kaa aayojan kiya gaya, jisamen film abhinayta govinda bhi pahunche or puri tarah gurubhakti main najar aae
 The heat of the Lok Sabha elections is increasing across the country, while former Congress MP Govinda seems to be absorbed in these days
 govinda ne yah saaf kah diya ki ve raajnneeti chhod chuke hai
 Holi festival of Ashram was special in another case
 is baar asaram apane bhakton kaa nahin, balki bhakton ne hi asaram par lage daag ko dhone kii koshish kii
 In the Sant Sammelan, where all the saints were telling a conspiracy to rape Asaram, Govinda, who reached the occasion, also supported Asaram without naming him
 govinda ne kaha ki guru varg kaa maan-sammaan sampoorn jagat main hota rahegaa
 On this occasion, Govinda recited Shiva Shankar by reading verses in Sanskrit
 isse pehle, ashram kii ore se pravaktaa neelam dube ne asaram or narayan sai par lage daagon par safai di
 According to Neelam, such saints' conferences have happened before and this stain will be washed away when the time comes
 haalanki neelam ke paas aise sawaalon ke jawaab nahin the ki aakhir ek vakt holi ke utsav par lakhon bhakt aate the, lekin is baar mahotsav main mahaj ginati ke log hi kyon aae hai
 In such a situation, has the faith of people towards Asaram decreased? Do film actors have to resort to gathering crowds today? However, without Asaram and Narayan, the Holi festival at Surat Ashram looked completely faded
 asaram ke charitra par lage daag ko dhone kii yah koshish bhi naakaam hi najar ai

 mumbai ke andheri upnagar main varsova ke paas aaraam nagar he
 It used to be a military barrack during the Second World War
 aazaadee ke baad karachi or sindh se aae hinduon ke liye ise transit camp bana diya gaya
 At this time, young people come here with dreams in their eyes
 inamen se kuch ke sapane kuch had tak puure hote hai to kuch saalon-saal inhen daftaron ke aage nai ummid ke saath roj khadey dikhte hai
 In fact, in the same Aram Nagar-2, there are several art connoisseurs who work to fulfill the dreams of talented artists
 cinemai bhashaa main inhen casting diarector kehete hai
 To dream of becoming an actor is many times more difficult than making someone an actor
 yah anubhav bollywood ke mashhoor casting diarectaron jogi malang, mukesh chhabda, shruti mahajan or kunal em
 Shah has also realized
 aaj badi sankhya main filmein banati hai or filmon ke nirmaan par karodon rupye kharch hote hai
 Filmmaking is a business and no producer wants to increase the budget of the film for any reason
 iske saath hi film main aisa koi bhi kamjor actor nahin liya jaataa jiske abhinay se film box offis par ludhak jaae
 a film business burns the stove of the house of dozens of people, its entire plot is kept by the film team
 lekin aise nae kalakaaron ko is baat kaa jaraa bhi andaja nahin rahata jo apni kaabiliyat ko parakhe bina filmon main kaam paane mumbai chale aate hai
 Casting director Kunchal M
 shah kehete hai, ''amitabh bachchan, shahrukh khan, ranbir singh or varun dhawan banane kii chahat liye mumbai pahunche yuvaaon main se zyaadaatar ko yah pataa nahin ki in kalakaaron ne is industry main jagah banane ke liye kitna pasinaa bahaya he
 "famous casting director Shruti Mahajan has her own experience," says the white-spotted boys from Punjab have a good look and face
 lekin unke maa-baap kai baar pehle hi dharna bana lete hai ki unka betaa akshay kumaar or ranbir kapur se jaraa bhi kam nahin
 There is a need to change this mindset
 filmon main sirf chehre nahin balki kaabiliyat kaaphi myne rakhti he
 "in the past, apart from the hero-heroine of the film, other actors were also selected by the producer-director or it was done by a member of the film's unit
 lekin ab film nirmaan kii takanic aadhunik hote jane ke saath navagantukon kii bheed badhati ja rahi he
 In such a situation, the casting director has become a full-fledged department and has more responsibilities
 casting diarector mukesh chhabda bataate hai, ''sabase pehle film bandit queen main tigmanshu dhulia ne casting kii thi
 He was followed by Jogi Malang and Honey Trehan
 isi kram main maine apane naam se company kholi
 Just as today there is a training school for acting, directing and screenwriting, in the same way in the coming years, schools will also be opened for casting directors
 "jogi, mukesh, shruti or kunal vagairah maanate hai ki ab koi bhi vyakti kisi bhi film ke liye kisi ko bhi cast nahin kar saktaa kyonki ab kirdaar ke mutabik, parfect actor chahie
 They are also of the opinion that the youth coming to Mumbai now are better than before
 unako maaloom he ki agar puri taiyaari ke saath nahin aae to unhen kisi bhi film main kaam nahin milegaa
 The casting director should also have an understanding of cinema, theater, literature and acting
 jo bhi casting diarector isamen kamjor hoga, use sahi actor ke chayan main pareshaani hogi
 Jogi himself is also a theater artist
 ve safadar hashmi se prabhavit hokar jananaty manch se jude the
 He has worked with artists like Habib Tanveer and Zohra Sehgal
 mukesh kii bhi prishthbhumi theatre vaali he
 Shruti comes from the corporate world
 lekin unhone bhi khud ko theatre se jod kar rakhaa he
 She has been an assistant to renowned casting director Shanu Sharma in Yash Raj Films
 aam taur par kam bajet kii filmon kii bajaae bade bajet kii filmon ke liye casting karnaa thodaa aasaan hota he
 Artists get a fair bit of money
 lekin mukesh kii maane to filmein choti hon yaa badi, casting donon ke liye kathin he
 Hard work has to be done in both
 jogi kaa apana akalan he ki haal ke varshon main choti filmon kaa chalan shuru hua he
 In this, the film has to be shot within the time-limit, so all actors are good
 isamen koi mushkil bhi nahin
 Artists coming from a theater background have an appetite for acting
 unke liye paise utana myne nahin rakhte
 Listen to Shruti, "just as a doctor has difficulty in curing disease, in the same way we choose an actor
" script or diarector kya chaahate hai, ham yah samajhate hai or production se baat karke apana kaam karte hai
 "here Kunal says that new producers and directors also demand good actors in low budgets
 iske liye mehnat kerani padati he or phir actor mil bhi jate hai
 "now a single person cannot do the work of casting
 yah kaam ek prabandhan kii tarah hota he
 Hence each casting director has his own team
 isamen kai log kaam karte hai
 Finally, the casting director meets the director of the film and finalizes the cast list
 ek casting diarector kaa dayera shahar se gaanvon tak failaa rahata he
 It has a bank of artists from the village, theater group, local institution
 jogi, mukesh, shruti or kunal kaa kahana he ki jab film main local kalakaar kii jarurat hoti he to uske liye us gaanv yaa shahar main jaakar actor kaa chayan karnaa padataa he
 Jogi says that Ishqiya had a character named Nandu who was not getting
 bahut mashkkat ke baad pataa chalaa ki bihar ke patna main abhishek naam kaa ek ladkaa he jo nandu jaisaa he
 This boy was not an actor but was amazing
 mukesh bataate hai ki gangs of vasepur ke liye 400 kairactor chunane main ek saal kaa samay laga tha
 Shruti also believes that the selection of artists in the north-east for Mary Kom was quite challenging
 kunal bataate hai ki laal rang main navdith kalakaar piya vaajapeyi kaa kairactor mul rup main vah nahin tha jo film main dikhaaya gaya tha
 Her character was made of UP girl
 kyonki ve mul rup se uttar pradesh ke itawa kii rahane vaali hai or unki boli udhar kii hi he to unke kairactor ko upi kaa karke unhen film main role diya gaya tha
 The formula for casting is that the cast is taken first (profile and look photo)
 uske baad unka audishan hota he
 After fitting in the character, the cast is taken to the director of the film
 is tarah se ab kalakaaron kaa chayan aasaan ho gaya he
 Jogi says that first they read the script and feel the character inside them
 iske baad kalakaaron kaa chunaav shuru karte hai
 Mukesh also agrees with this process
 shruti bataati hai ki kaaphi audishan ke baad diarector kalakaar ko pasand karte hai
 These casting directors are of the view that the coming of youngsters associated with theatrical organizations like Indian Institute of Film and Television, National School of Drama, Bharatendu Natya Academy, Shriram Center, Barry John's School and Madhya Pradesh Natya Vidyalaya do not have much trouble in casting
 
 aisi jagahon se aae kalakaar abhinay kii baarikiyon ko pehle se jaanate, samajhate hai
 Jogi says that now the young people do not come straight away to become actors
 unamem acting kii bhukh dikhti he
 Questions have always been raised about the dialect and language of the youth seeking work in films, especially those from Bihar
 unke bare main kaha jaataa he ki ve acchhee hindi nahin bol pate
 But casting directors believe that language is no longer a problem
 jogi bataate hai ki bihar, upi, empi, chandigarh or punjab ke alaava haryana se bhi yuva aane lage hai
 The Haryana government has opened a school in Rohtak where acting is taught
 yah acha he ki chote ilaake se noujvaan puri taiyaari ke saath aa rahe hai
 "I had difficulty in choosing the cast for Madras Cafe because we wanted artists in Tamil Nadu who know both Tamil and Hindi languages," he says
 mujhe kalakaaron ke chayan main ek maheenaa laga tha
 Shruti says that apart from Mumbai and Delhi, good talent is also available in Lucknow, Indore and Bhopal
 lakhanu ke yuvaaon main art, litarechar or theatre kaa becoground miltaa he
 They hold both urdu-hindi languages
 mukesh maanate hai ki theth sthaneey boli bhi hamen kaaphi madad karti he
 But young people need to learn english-hindi
 jogi or mukesh dilli se hai
 Shruti is from Jaipur and Kunal is from Mumbai
 ye apane shahar ke culture se waakif hai or isse unhen casting main madad milti he
 Jogi is said to help young artists
 mukesh or shruti bhi tallent ko badhaava dene main kotahi nahin karte
 For the character that fits the cast, the casting director consults the director of the film
 isliye mukesh kii najaron ne rajkumaar raav, sushant singh rajput or amit saadh ko pahachaanaa
 He has shown his casting ability in dozens of films including Imtiaz Ali's Love Aaj Tak, Anurag Kashyap's Gangs of Wasseypur, Chintooji, Chennai Express, Kya Po Che, Haider, Dangal, Shahid, Rockstar and Badlapur
 aisa kah sakate hai ki casting diarection neeras or thakaane vaala kaam he
 Despite this, Jogi has done films like Bhanwar, Agni Chakra, Vicky Donor, Madras Cafe, Piku, Udaan, Matrubhoomi, Samay, Delhi-6, Ishqiya, NH-10
 jogi ne ayushmaan khurana ko dekhte hi kah diya tha ki yahi viki donor he
 Shruti had attracted the filmmakers very soon by her ability and Sanjay Leela Bhansali trusted her so much that she entrusted him with the responsibility of casting Ramlila
 iske saath hi unhone bajirao mastaani, padmavati, mairi com, jai gangaajal jaisi filmon ke liye kalakaar chhante
 Kunal is the first choice of producers of low budget films
 unhone laal rang, yangistan, het story-2, dangeras ishk, khilaadi 786, ankur aroda murder cese jaisi filmon ke liye casting kii
 He gave Pia Vajpayee, Kiara Advani, Meera Chopra, Tara Alisha Berry a chance to showcase their talent
 sunaaria jail main ek vishesh adaalat kaksh banaaya gaya he jahaan jaj jagadeep singh gurmeet ko sajaa sunaayenge
 Inspector General of Police of Rohtak Range Navdeep Singh Virk said that the judge's helicopter will land on a helipad near the jail on the outskirts of Rohtak City
 unhone kaha ki dopaher kareeb 2:30 baje gurmeet ko sajaa sunai ja sakati he
 (also from input agencies) desh ke kareeb 30 fisadi block main bhumigat jal teji se khatm ho rahaa he, aise main kisi bade jal sankat se bachane ke liye sarkaar 6,000 karod rupee kii mahatvakankshi yojana bana rahi he
 Under this plan, community participation will strengthen the system of reclamation of water resources
 centre sarkaar kii 'atal bhoojal yojana' naamak is yojana kii aadhi laagat vishwa bank vahan karegaa or aadhi rakam centre sarkaar bajtiy sahyog ke rup degi
 Significantly, the water crisis has deepened in many parts of the country
 kendriya jal sansaadhan sachiv upi singh ko ummid he ki iske liye 31 march, 2018 tak bajet manjuur ho jayega, taaki ise ek april se lagu kiya ja sake
 The plan will focus on the recharge of water resources and effective use of water at the local level
 kendriya bhoojal board (cgwb)ke pichley akalan report ke anusaar desh ke 6,584 block main survey karne par pataa chalaa ki inamen se 1,034 block main bhoojal kaa jarurat se zyada dohan ho chukaa he
 This means that the amount of groundwater consumed annually in these blocks is more than the annual groundwater recharge
 times of india ke anusaar 934 block kii haalat behad samvedansheel maani ja sakati he, kyonki vahaan jal kaa bas upbhog ho rahaa he or punarbharan kaa koi upaay nahin he
 Many states like Delhi, UP, Haryana are concentrated in the state of poor superfluous water consuming blocks Punjab, Haryana, Delhi, West UP, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Tamil Nadu
 inamen se punjab, haryana, rajasthan or dilli kii haalat sabase kharaab he
 Of the 248 blocks assessed in Rajasthan, 66 per cent are under over-exploitation
 iske baad dilli (56%) kaa sthaan he
 Significantly, 60 percent of the irrigation requirement in the country, 85 percent of the drinking water requirement and about 50 percent of the urban water supply comes from ground water

 haalanki police ke mutabik ghatana ko kisi kareebi ne anjaam diya he or police maamle ki jaanch kar rahi he
 Conducting peaceful elections in Bihar has always been a challenge for the Election Commission and the administration
 aise main agle loksabhaa chunaav ko bhi is chunauti se alag nahin mana ja rahaa he
 The biggest challenge in the 6-phase Lok Sabha elections in Bihar is being considered to curb Naxalite violence
 haalanki police or chunaav ayog, donon hi is chunauti se nipatane kii taiyaari main jute gaye hai
 It is generally believed that almost all districts of Bihar have some kind of Naxal influence
 lekin rajya ke 38 jilon main se 31 jilon main naksaliyon ke prabhaav kii pushti khufia agenciyaan bhi karti hai
 It is not that the police administration is conscious about Naxalites, many leaders of the state are also in the hit list of Naxalites
 aise main raajnneetik dalon ko jahaan vipakshiyon kii chunauti kaa saamana karnaa padegaa, vahiin naksaliyon se bhi inhen jujhna hoga
 In order to succeed the slogan of election boycott, Naxalite organizations have been obstructing the election in one way or another, so the activism of Naxalite organizations also increases during the election
 grih mantralay ne bhi bihar ke 20 jilon ko naksal prabhavit jilon kii 'e' shrenee main rakhaa he
 The six most Naxal-affected areas to be polled during the first phase of polling in Bihar include Gaya, Karakat, Sasaram, Aurangabad, Nawada and Jamui Lok Sabha constituencies
 bihar kii maatr 40 lekasabha siton ke liye chah charnon main matdaan karaae jane ke chunaav ayog ke nirnay ko suraksha kii drushti se dekha ja rahaa he
 The Commission is believed to want widespread deployment of security agencies in all areas
 bihar main pratibandhit naksali sanghathan bhartiya communist party (maovadi) ke alaava bhi kai naksali sanghathan ke hathiyaarband daste gathit hai, jo chunaav bahishkaar kii ghoshnaa karte rahe hai
 It also has Naxalite organizations like Maoist People's Liberation Guerrilla Army (PLGA), Third Presentation Committee (TPC), CPI (ml-manpower)
 vaise tipisi kaa varchasv jharkhand ke seemaa kshetron main mana jaataa he
 If we look at the figures, 69 people were killed in the Naxalite incidents in Bihar in 2013
 pichley loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan naksaliyon ne bina unki anumati ke prachaar vaahanon ko bhi sudur kshetron main jane se roak diya tha
 In Aurangabad district many such vehicles were stopped and political activists sitting on them were beaten up
 vahiin, rajya ke police mukhyalay ke ek adhikari ne kaha ki prayek chunaav main naksali chunaav vahishkaar kii ghoshnaa karte hai
 The police is preparing to deal with it
 matdaan kendron par bhi suraksha ke pukhta prabandh kiye jaaenge
 He said that it is a challenge to conduct fair and peaceful elections in the state, which is also his priority
 naksal prabhavit loksabhaa kshetron main chunaav ko lekar ardhsainik balon ke saath-saath cobra batalian ke commando kii tainaati bhi kii jaaegi, jinhen naksali ilaakon main abhiyaan chalaane main maharath hasil he
 According to sources, Border Security Force helicopters will also be deployed during polling in Naxal-affected areas
 rajya ke police mahanideshak abhayanand ne bhi kaha ki rajya main surakshabalon kii koi kami nahin he
 The Bar Council of India has set age limits of 30 and 20 respectively for three more five-year law degree courses
 usne madras hai court ke order ko behaal rakhaa he
 After this circular, the candidates and colleges who are desirous of law are surprised
 council dwaara jari patr is baat kii taakid karata he ki alag-alag course main daakhile kii chaah rakhane vaale ummidavaaron ko legal ajukeshan rules 2008 kii dhara 28 ke hisaab se chalanaa hoga
 According to this, the maximum age limit for the five-year integrated program is 20 years and for the three-year law degree, the maximum age limit has been fixed at 30 years
 is puure maamle par ek loyr kaa kahana he ki council bombai, punjab or haryana hai court ke order par vichaar karne main fail rahi he
 This circular was released on 17 September
 pehle charan kii admician prakriya puri ho chuki hai
 There is no clear direction from the institution of the state
 baar council ne umr seemaa kaa maamalarajya ke jimmechhod diya he
 The state did not put any such qualification in its admission rules as they had not issued any such notice beforehand
 is maamle par rajya ke ek adhikari kaa kahana he ki yah naiysargik nyaay ke khilaaf he
 He has not given any orders to the government regarding this
 baar council ke adhikari satish deshmukh kaa kahana he ki council ne collejon ko koi bhi chhot dene kii baat nahin kahi he
 If the college enrolls such students and they find irregularity on inspection after 4 months, then the Legal Education Panel can take action

 isi tarah manoj tiwari ne punjab ke kilaaf 23 gend par naabad 40 ran banaae lekin team kii jeet ke liye ye naakaafi rahaa
 On the other hand, Stokes, the most expensive foreign player of the IPL season, has done well both from ball and bat

 taahir ne ab tak 5 wicket liye hai or ballebaazon ko pareshaan karne main koi kor kasar nahin chodi he

 zahir khan and company ne aaarasibi ko 157 ran par bhale roak diya lekin jeet se 15 ran dur hi rahi
 Zaheer took 2 wickets against Bengaluru and Chris Morris took 3 wickets while Pat Cummins took one wicket
 ballebaazi kii baat karen to rishabh pant ko chhodkar dilli ke dileron ko qamar kasni hogi, khaaskar top order ke ballebaazon ko
 Sam Billings caught the rhythm but could not progress beyond 25 runs and the form of Karun Nair, who scored a second triple century for India in Tests, is now under question
 pehle match main chote lakshya ko hasil nahin kar paane kaa malaal zahir ko zarur hoga
 In such a situation, they may need to work on fresh strategies

 The Central Government returned the proposal of partition in the four parts of the state passed in the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly to the State Government and asked for clarification on the issues like proposed capitals, limits and increasing debt burden
 kendriya grih sachiv aarake singh ne kaha, hamane uttar pradesh ke rajya ke vibhaajan ke prastaav ko waapas bhej diya he or aath se nau prashnon par jawaab maange hai
 Home Ministry officials said that the ministry has returned the proposal to Uttar Pradesh, saying that it needs clarification on several key issues before taking action on the resolution passed by the state assembly
 uttar pradesh vidhansabha main november main mukhyamantri mayawati ne vipaksh ko achraj main daalate hue rajya ko avadh pradesh, purvanchal, bundelkhand or pashchim pradesh main vibhajin karne sambandhi prastaav rakhaa tha
 Mayawati's opponents called it a political ploy in the wake of the state assembly elections next year

 On January 8, 2013, the country received a heartbreaking news when Lance Naik Hemraj, a resident of Mathura, was killed in the Krishna Valley near the loc in Jammu and Kashmir
 pakistani fouj ne unke saath ek or jawan sudhakar singh kaa sir kalam kar diya tha
 This barbaric act of Pakistani soldiers had brought the country to a boil
 us vakt hemraj kii shahadat par khub raajnneeti hui
 But the family of Hemraj's martyrdom after six years is wandering rate for help
 sarkaar ke vaade ab bhi kaagajon par hi he
 Shaheed Hemraj's wife Dharmavati and her three children have been traveling from office to office for the last six years
 lekin ab tak na to unhen sarkari naukari mili he or na hi petrol pump
 Even the quarters of Mathura's Cantt area in which Hemraj's widow is living with her children
 use bhi khaali karne ke notice mil rahe hai
 Hemraj's widow Dharmavati told NDTV - Six years have passed, neither got a government job nor a petrol pump
 mantri rajnath singh se bhi fariyaad kar chuki hum, or bhi kai daftaron main chakkar kaat chuki hum
 It costs to come and go but the work is not done
 lihaaja ab ghar baith gaye hai
 It is the same martyr Hemraj, on whose martyrdom, from Narendra Modi to Sushma Swaraj, in election speeches, he claimed to bring ten heads from Pakistan instead of one
 hemraj kii shahadat ke baad bijepi ne congress ko kathghare main khadaa karne main koi kor kasar nahin chodi
 Politics also fiercely took place on this issue
 lekin aaj sarkaar shahid hemraj ke parivaar ko bhul chuki he
 Not only this, in the 25 lakh rupees received from the government, a fraud of 10 lakh rupees has also happened with his wife
 jab sena kaa jawan banakar aayaa ek vyakti jhansa dekar das lakh rupee lekar faraar ho gaya tha
 Hemraj's wife's pension is not enough to teach three children
 yah khabar paakar ek samajasevi sanghathan ne parivaar ke medical or beti kii padhai kaa kharchaa uthaane kii baat kahi he
 Lalita Sehrawat, a member of Meera Shree Charitable said that when we went to her village, we saw how three children can be taught with a pension, it is very difficult to understand that i am a woman
 isliye hamane kharchaa uthaane kaa faisla kiya he
 Not only this, Hemraj's martyrdom day is celebrated every year in his village on 8 January, his money is also borne by Hemraj's wife
 jisase diarectorat aaf eks sarviceman welfare par bhi sawaal uth rahe hai
 There is also a lot of resentment among the ex-soldiers for seeing the martyr Hemraj's family wandering
 ritred major general espi sinha ne ise durbhagyapurna bataate hue kaha ki diarectorat aaf eks sarviceman welfare kii sthapana purv sainikon kii madad ke liye hui thi, magar vahaan iees afasar baithe hai, unhen shaheedon or sainikon ke pariwaron se kya lenaa-dena
 However, those who take political advantage on the martyrdom of Hemraj may no longer have any sympathy for the martyr's family, but it is a matter of shame for the families of the soldiers posted on the border to stumble rate for their rights

 The ADR sought a difference in the number of votes in the election, seeking to provide accurate data before the announcement of the claimants
 The Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) has filed a petition in the Supreme Court, claiming the difference in the number of votes in the Lok Sabha elections
 yachika main kaha gaya he ki is gadabadi ke bare main kuch bhi bataane se chunaav ayog ne inkaar kar diya he
 In such a situation, there has been a demand from the court to direct the Election Commission of India to provide accurate data on how many votes to cast before announcing any election result
 iske saath hi ediaar ne 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav parinaamon se sambandhit aankadon main aisi sabhi visangatiyon kii jaanch karne kii bhi apil kii he
 Expressing concern over the election process, the ADR has said that confusion is being created by the current system that declares election results
 ediaar kaa daavaapani yachika menediaarne kaha he ki chunaav ayog dwaara pramanit chunavi data jari hone se pehle hi chunaav nateezon kii ghoshnaa karke chunaav karaane kii maujuuda pranali main hone vaali ghuspaith kahin adhik gambhir or ek khatarnaak pravriti he
 Therefore, it cannot be ignored
 yachika main kaha gaya he, 'is tarah kii chizon se andeh, bhram or kanflict kii sthit paidaa hoti he
 This also increases the possibility of the election process being maligned
 chunaav ayog ko nattejey jari karne se pehle sabhi riterning afasaron se sateek aankadon ko hasil karne ke baad hi elaan karnaa chahie
 But if announced earlier, it is unconstitutional, illegal, arbitrary and unjust
 'badla gaya tha databta den ki chunaav ayog ne 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav parinaamon kii ghoshnaa ke baad apni website ke saath-saath apane mobile ap,‘my Voters Turnout App’ main bhi matdaan kaa data ko badal diya tha
 The petition said that after the election results were declared, the voting data made available on the Commission's website and its app were changed several times and it may have been done to hide the shortcomings

 The Shiv Sena has kept silence on the candidature of Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi
 party ke pramukh uddhav thakare se jab pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar ke bare main sawaal kiya gaya to unhone kaha ki endie main kai vishwasaneey chehre hai
 When Uddhav was asked about Modi, he had the same answer
 ishaara saaf he, philhal shivasena endie ke piem ummidavaar par apane pattey nahin kholana chaahati he
 He said, 'the country needs a reliable face
 shivasena or bijepi milakar kai chehron main apana ek ummidavaar chunegi
 'uddhav Thackeray said,' NDA candidate will be announced when the time comes
 main or rajnath singh milakar tay karenge
 Uddhav Thackeray said these things after addressing the annual meeting of ASSOCHAM
 piem mudde par bhale hi shivasena modi ke naam par chup ho
 But whether it is the Ishrat Jahan issue or the disputed statement of Modi's burqa, Uddhav has been openly defending Modi, saying that Shiv Sena has been advising BJP to persist on Hindutva issue
 party ne yahaan tak kaha he ki hindutv ke mudde par bane rahane par hi bijepi ke saath gathjod bana rahegaa
 This edification has also had an impact on the BJP
 bijepi kii mumbai ikai ne party kii chunaav abhiyaan samiti ke adhyaksh ke poster puure shahar main laga diye hai, jinamein unhen ‘hindu rashtravaadi’ or deshbhakt ke taur par dikhaaya gaya he
 However, in the midst of all these efforts, doubts remain in Modi's name

 God's Plan !! June 21st, 2017 was the day @ dirrty99 and i found out that we might be possible having 3children within a short amount of time
 We planned and tried to have a family and after so many years our family is now complete with Asher Singh Weber, Noah Singh Weber and Nisha Kaur Weber
 Our boys were born a few weeks ago but were alive in our hearts and eyes for many years
 God planned something so special for us and gave us a large family
 We are both the proud parents of three beautiful children
 Surprise everyone!a post shared by Sunny Leone (@sunnyleone) on Mar 4, 2018 at 9:43pm pstjust so there is no confusion Asher and Noah are our biological children
 We chose surrogacy to complete our family many years ago and it's now finally complete :) so happy! dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal kaa 'cinema prem' kisi se chupa nahin he
 Kejriwal has been seen many times in the theater watching movies with his ministers
 lekin kejariwal kaa ye shauk sirf shauk nahin he wo film ko manoranjan ke liye hi nahin balki sikh ke taur par bhi dekhte hai
 Perhaps that's why Kejriwal's character resembles the 'hero' of the silver screen
 janata ke 'nayak' rahe hai kejarivaldilli ke ramlila maidan main arvind kejariwal ne dilli ke mukhyamantri pad kii shapath lee, to vahaan jute logon ke haathon main 'nayak' film ke poster the

 netaa ke role ko nayaa luk dene vaale kejariwal kabhi mafalar to kaaphi sada libaas or kabhi apni boli kii vajah se logon ke aakarshan kaa centre rahe
 It is worth noting that while 'nayak' was seen doing wonders in reel life, Kejriwal has surpassed the film 'nayak' by performing acts like 'nayak' in real life
 kejariwal kaa phone par raay maanganadilli main aam aadmi party kii sarkaar kaa ek saal puraa hone ke maukey par kejariwal or unke mantri phone ke jariye raay shumaari karenge

 Arvind Kejriwal rose from the middle of the common man to reach the Chief Minister's chair
 unhone apni raajnneetik party banaai, lekin isse pehle ve inakam tex afasar or ek samaajik kaaryakarta the
 The hero of 'nayak' Shivaji Rao Gaikwad was also a common man who was a minor reporter in a TV channel
 film ko darshakon ne kaaphi pasand kiya tha
 The social site has also rocked the movie Love Chief Minister Kejriwal was found not only watching movies like PK, Masaan, Drishyam, Airlift and Wazir, but he also talked about these films on social media
 unka film kii taraf jhukaav soshal media par bhi surkhiyaan bator chukaa he
 Kejriwal and theater in Vaishali Recently when Kejriwal reached the cinema hall to watch Akshay Kumar's film 'airlift', some people present welcomed him by shouting 'modi-modi'
 darasal kejariwal dilli ke up mukhyamantri manish sisodiya ke saath gajiabad ke vaishali main sthit asal plaza main film dekhne pahunche the
 They often go to the movies
